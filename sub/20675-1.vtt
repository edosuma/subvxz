00:36.526 --> 00:39.825
We must adjust to changing times...

00:46.570 --> 00:49.767
...execute the office of President
of the United States...

01:37.787 --> 01:40.654
I challenge a new generation
of young Americans...

02:07.150 --> 02:09.640
My biggest fantasy when I was a kid

02:09.686 --> 02:12.746
was that I would go to see
my favorite band play,

02:12.822 --> 02:15.416
and someone would come out and say,

02:15.458 --> 02:19.986
"Sorry, the band can't play tonight,
their drummer broke his fuckin' leg.

02:20.030 --> 02:22.021
"Unless there's someone
that knows all the songs..."

02:22.065 --> 02:25.557
Then, of course, I would jump up
and be the greatest drummer in the world.

02:25.635 --> 02:27.432
I fantasized about that.

02:33.043 --> 02:35.739
With Nirvana, the process
of making the music

02:35.779 --> 02:39.442
was so entirely simple and pure and real.

02:39.482 --> 02:42.781
Kurt was a great lyricist,
he had a beautiful voice,

02:42.852 --> 02:45.844
and he wrote really simple songs.

02:45.889 --> 02:50.053
There were things I learned about songwriting
from being in a band with Kurt

02:50.093 --> 02:53.062
that I don't think anyone else
could have taught me.

03:04.207 --> 03:05.970
That record, Nevermind, came out

03:06.009 --> 03:09.501
almost a year to the day
after I had joined the band.

03:10.380 --> 03:12.905
This song is called Smells Like Teen Spirit.

03:12.949 --> 03:14.678
Before Dave had joined the band,

03:14.718 --> 03:19.883
there was a message on my
answering machine from Kurt, saying,

03:19.923 --> 03:24.360
"Butch! We have the best drummer in the
world! He's the greatest drummer in the world.

03:24.394 --> 03:28.888
"I'm not kidding you. He's awesome, dude!"
And he hung up.

03:28.932 --> 03:32.698
About a week later we were in LA
and I walked into a rehearsal space with him.

03:32.736 --> 03:35.933
And Dave walked up - skinny, long hair...

03:35.972 --> 03:38.941
"Hey, man, I'm Dave. Nice to meet you."
He was just full of energy.

03:38.975 --> 03:42.342
I was like, "Let's play.
Play me some songs, you guys."

03:42.379 --> 03:44.404
And they played Teen Spirit.

03:44.447 --> 03:45.846
Dave did the...

03:46.850 --> 03:48.408
...and it just floored me.

03:57.594 --> 03:59.824
Of course, everybody was telling the band

03:59.863 --> 04:02.593
that they thought we were great,

04:02.632 --> 04:04.998
but I don't think the three of us ever believed

04:05.035 --> 04:07.526
a word of anything anyone was telling us.

04:07.570 --> 04:12.234
We never thought we were gonna sell
a million records.

04:13.109 --> 04:17.409
None of us had any idea that it was gonna
completely change my life and their lives.

04:17.447 --> 04:21.349
But I knew that they sounded really tight
and pretty focused,

04:21.384 --> 04:24.319
and that they had written
some amazingly powerful songs.

04:29.559 --> 04:31.151
We knew something was happening

04:31.194 --> 04:34.288
because the atmosphere of the gigs
just changed.

04:34.331 --> 04:39.667
They went from being cool, hipster,
underground people in a club

04:39.703 --> 04:43.366
to, like...
jocks were coming to the show.

04:43.406 --> 04:45.033
That was the first thing, like,

04:45.075 --> 04:47.566
"Oh my God, there's jocks here,"
you know?

04:47.610 --> 04:50.170
"That's kind of strange.
They like our music?

04:50.213 --> 04:53.444
"You used to kick my fucking ass
for listening to this music."

05:17.140 --> 05:20.007
I was a really big fan of Nirvana,
like everybody else,

05:20.043 --> 05:23.035
and I happened to be reading
an interview with Kurt

05:23.079 --> 05:24.444
where he had mentioned,

05:24.481 --> 05:28.679
Nirvana was always meant to be a four-piece,
a two-guitar band.

05:28.718 --> 05:33.052
It was never meant to be a three-piece.
I thought, "Oh, well that's my in."

05:43.733 --> 05:47.499
Pat is from this legendary punk rock band
called the Germs

05:47.537 --> 05:49.334
that we all grew up listening to.

05:49.372 --> 05:52.500
There was no one more badass
than the Germs.

05:52.542 --> 05:54.339
Germs didn't give a fuck.

05:59.149 --> 06:02.175
So Pat shows up in Seattle,
and all of us were just like,

06:02.252 --> 06:04.948
"Oh my God, hey, it's Pat Smear
from the Germs.

06:06.256 --> 06:07.848
"He's alive?"

06:07.891 --> 06:10.155
So now Nirvana is hitting the big halls,

06:10.193 --> 06:13.424
with guitarist Pat Smear
helping to make the loud louder.

06:13.463 --> 06:17.160
The day before the first rehearsal
I saw my picture on MTV News, saying,

06:17.200 --> 06:19.964
"Nirvana has a new guitar player, Pat Smear."

06:20.003 --> 06:22.301
I was like, "My God, it's real! There it is!"

06:30.180 --> 06:33.911
I don't think Kurt wanted to be
a huge fuckin' rock star.

06:33.950 --> 06:39.115
And I don't think he could handle
how complicated it had all become.

06:45.628 --> 06:50.622
No one was very happy with the tour,
or the band.

06:51.167 --> 06:52.600
So Kurt decided he wants a break,

06:52.635 --> 06:54.933
even though we're on this tour
you can't get out of,

06:54.971 --> 06:56.939
because you're a big band
and you get sued.

06:56.973 --> 07:02.036
We had, like, a week and a half off
in between two legs of the tour.

07:02.078 --> 07:04.774
I decided to fly home.

07:04.814 --> 07:11.117
And Kurt went to Rome, where he was
meeting Courtney Love, his wife.

07:14.724 --> 07:16.692
Hi, I'm Tabitha Soren, with MTV News.

07:16.726 --> 07:18.751
Nirvana front man Kurt Cobain

07:18.795 --> 07:22.856
was hospitalized in a coma in Rome, Italy
on Friday morning...

07:22.899 --> 07:30.533
I turn on the TV, and Kurt was being
wheeled away in an ambulance in Rome.

07:31.975 --> 07:37.607
I went to the hospital with him, and I didn't
know what to do, because I thought,

07:37.647 --> 07:41.242
"Do I say, this is Kurt Cobain,
take care of him right away, VIP,"

07:41.985 --> 07:45.580
or do I say, "This is just some guy,
don't call the press"?

07:45.622 --> 07:52.289
I finally went with, "This is Kurt Cobain, VIP.
Do something about it."

07:54.464 --> 07:57.365
Nirvana spokespeople reported
encouraging signs,

07:57.400 --> 08:00.392
saying they've been told Kurt Cobain
was responding to his name,

08:00.436 --> 08:02.961
opening his eyes,
and squeezing his wife's hand.

08:03.640 --> 08:07.269
When he came home,
I remember talking to him on the phone,

08:07.310 --> 08:13.647
and saying, "Hey man,
I don't want you to die, OK?"

08:14.817 --> 08:19.015
And he was very apologetic,
"No, I'm sorry, it was a big mistake.

08:19.055 --> 08:22.821
"I took these pills, I was drinking
this champagne and I was in Rome...

08:23.927 --> 08:27.829
"It was, just a...
just made a mistake."

08:32.235 --> 08:35.534
It was really sad. I had a message
from Kurt, but I wasn't home.

08:35.605 --> 08:38.938
And so whatever help he needed from me,
I couldn't help him.

08:40.409 --> 08:43.504
And that was the last time
I ever talked to him or saw him.

09:15.211 --> 09:18.237
When I found out that he had killed himself...

09:19.182 --> 09:21.173
I was kind of numb.

09:23.786 --> 09:26.346
I knew that it...

09:27.490 --> 09:32.393
He was gone,
but I didn't know how to feel.

09:33.963 --> 09:36.955
Kurt Cobain, a sweet and gifted man,
dead at the age of 27.

09:37.000 --> 09:40.094
To Courtney Love,
one-year-old Frances Bean Cobain,

09:40.136 --> 09:42.900
Dave Grohl, Kris Novoselic and Pat Smear,
our deepest sympathies.

09:52.281 --> 09:54.146
Everybody knew Kurt was in a bad way,

09:54.183 --> 09:57.277
but that's something
you never expect to happen.

09:57.320 --> 09:59.185
When someone is that down and out

09:59.222 --> 10:03.386
you still can't comprehend that they're
actually gonna commit suicide.

10:03.426 --> 10:04.893
It was terrible.

10:19.776 --> 10:25.237
After Kurt died, I didn't wanna play music.
I didn't wanna play the drums.

10:25.982 --> 10:28.815
When Kurt died,
it wasn't just that my friend died.

10:28.851 --> 10:33.515
It was my whole life kinda died around it
and with him, you know?

10:33.556 --> 10:37.048
And I quit the music business.

10:44.233 --> 10:47.430
At some point, I was finally motivated.

10:47.470 --> 10:51.270
"I'm gonna get myself out of this funk
I've been in for the last eight months."

10:51.340 --> 10:53.308
Or whatever it was, you know?

10:53.342 --> 10:57.676
I decided that I was gonna take
my favorite songs

10:57.714 --> 11:01.343
that I'd written over the last four or five years
that no one had heard...

11:02.218 --> 11:05.813
and I was going to record them...

11:05.855 --> 11:09.188
...at a 24-track studio
down the street from my house.

11:09.225 --> 11:14.185
And it was really exciting,
because I was doing it totally by myself.

11:14.230 --> 11:18.667
I didn't know why I was doing it.
I just wanted to do something, you know?

11:18.701 --> 11:20.726
So I booked a week at the studio,

11:20.770 --> 11:25.833
and at the end of the week, I had a cassette,
and it sounded good.

11:25.875 --> 11:28.844
And I started thinking,
"I won't put my name on it.

11:28.878 --> 11:31.176
"People will imagine it's just a band.

11:31.214 --> 11:33.682
"They won't know it's the guy from Nirvana."

11:39.856 --> 11:43.257
In the middle of that session,
I get a call at the studio

11:43.292 --> 11:47.490
that Tom Petty wants me to come
play drums for him on Saturday Night Live.

11:51.901 --> 11:55.234
I just thought,
"Oh my God, he's a hero of mine."

11:55.271 --> 12:01.039
And I had the opportunity to join the band
if I wanted to join the band.

12:01.077 --> 12:03.875
I really had to kind of choose.

12:03.913 --> 12:10.546
Was I going to play drums with Tom Petty,
or was I gonna start over from scratch

12:10.620 --> 12:13.680
and be the lead singer
and guitar player of a band,

12:13.723 --> 12:18.888
do something I'd never done before,
that I was terrified doing?

12:18.928 --> 12:21.726
Believe me, it was not easy to tell Tom Petty

12:21.764 --> 12:24.130
that I wasn't going to be his drummer.

12:24.167 --> 12:26.692
It was not an easy decision to make.

12:26.736 --> 12:31.673
I can still see my hand
just putting the phone down,

12:31.707 --> 12:35.973
and thinking, "OK, let's see what happens."

12:42.885 --> 12:46.150
There was a band in Seattle
called Sunny Day Real Estate.

12:46.189 --> 12:48.350
And a good friend of mine told me

12:48.391 --> 12:51.827
that Sunny Day Real Estate
were playing a show,

12:51.861 --> 12:54.796
and it was gonna be their last show
because they were breaking up.

12:54.831 --> 12:56.230
My band was falling apart

12:56.265 --> 13:00.929
about the same time that
Dave found himself without a band.

13:00.970 --> 13:03.268
We were broken up
while we were doing the tour.

13:03.306 --> 13:05.035
We decided we weren't gonna do it anymore,

13:05.074 --> 13:07.474
but had already booked this tour,
so we were like,

13:07.510 --> 13:09.944
"This will be the last thing we do."

13:09.979 --> 13:13.540
It was ironic because that was the first tour
that we were playing shows

13:13.583 --> 13:17.110
where people were actually showing up.
We were like, "Oh, well!"

13:17.153 --> 13:19.747
I went to the show to see them play,

13:19.789 --> 13:23.452
knowing it was probably the last time
anyone was gonna see them play.

13:23.492 --> 13:27.588
And I was watching them thinking,
"That's a really good rhythm section."

13:33.169 --> 13:35.034
I gave them the cassette, thinking,

13:35.071 --> 13:38.336
"Hey, check it out.
Maybe we could jam sometime."

13:38.374 --> 13:41.571
Dave was the first famous person I'd ever met.

13:41.611 --> 13:45.980
He was just out of Nirvana, you know,
like, that was a very big deal.

13:52.021 --> 13:56.117
I remember the first time that
Nate and William and I got together to jam.

13:56.158 --> 13:59.059
It was over at William's parents' house.

13:59.095 --> 14:02.155
I remember going up
to William's parents' kitchen

14:02.198 --> 14:04.496
and sitting there after we played,

14:04.533 --> 14:08.264
and Dave just goes,
"You guys wanna be in the band?"

14:09.205 --> 14:10.763
And I was like, "Hell yeah!"

14:10.806 --> 14:13.832
Playing in front of people
was very difficult for me.

14:13.876 --> 14:15.969
I did have a conversation with Dave

14:16.012 --> 14:18.674
and I said,
"I don't think that I should do it."

14:19.215 --> 14:23.345
Dave said, "That's exactly
why you're the guy that has to do it."

14:23.386 --> 14:27.755
I don't know what that meant
but that convinced me, I guess.

14:34.063 --> 14:37.794
After that rehearsal, Dave brings up
that he wants a second guitar player,

14:37.833 --> 14:39.198
and thinks it should be Pat Smear,

14:39.235 --> 14:43.228
who William and I knew from him having
played in Nirvana and the Germs.

14:43.272 --> 14:47.072
Then Dave came over,
and he gave me a cassette.

14:47.109 --> 14:50.408
I listened to that whole tape,
just front to end,

14:50.446 --> 14:52.073
and I thought it was all great.

14:52.114 --> 14:56.278
I didn't have anything against Pat.
I didn't know him as a musician or as a person.

14:56.319 --> 14:57.980
But he lived in Los Angeles,

14:58.020 --> 15:00.921
and I just thought that was fucking crazy.

15:00.957 --> 15:03.983
The way I'd grown up,
you were in a band with your friend from school

15:04.026 --> 15:05.015
that you saw every day.

15:05.061 --> 15:07.495
You'd go home after school and get together

15:07.530 --> 15:10.658
at somebody's mom's house or basement
and work it out.

15:10.700 --> 15:13.328
You can't do that
if the guy lives in Los Angeles.

15:13.402 --> 15:17.304
Pat came up, we played,
and he was perfect,

15:17.340 --> 15:20.537
so I got over that "Him living in LA" thing.

15:21.444 --> 15:24.379
I might have talked to him
about trying to move to Seattle.

15:25.214 --> 15:28.672
All of us came from bands
that ended prematurely.

15:28.718 --> 15:30.913
We didn't really talk about our former bands.

15:30.953 --> 15:33.888
For me, it was always
kind of a touchy subject.

15:33.923 --> 15:37.222
At this point in time,
Kurt had only been dead for a year,

15:38.094 --> 15:40.255
and I didn't wanna talk about it.

15:40.296 --> 15:42.594
So we all entered into this new band

15:42.631 --> 15:46.123
like it was helping us get through the loss

15:46.168 --> 15:48.102
of the bands we'd been in before.

15:48.137 --> 15:49.729
I remember it really vividly,

15:49.772 --> 15:52.332
Dave saying, like, "Let's have it be fun.

15:52.375 --> 15:54.343
"Let's have things be out in the open.

15:54.377 --> 15:56.470
"Let's talk about shit.
Just no drama."

15:56.512 --> 15:59.572
He was like,
"I don't want it to be a stressful thing.

15:59.648 --> 16:03.482
"We're not gonna tour into the ground."
And...

16:03.519 --> 16:04.577
Which I was glad about.

16:12.461 --> 16:13.985
The first tour that we did,

16:14.030 --> 16:17.124
was with a musician named Mike Watt.

16:17.166 --> 16:20.693
He is a legendary punk rock bass player.

16:23.706 --> 16:26.470
And he asked me if I would tour with him.

16:26.509 --> 16:29.706
And I said, "Yeah, man.
How about this?

16:29.745 --> 16:35.775
"I'll be in your band
if my band can open up on tour."

16:36.952 --> 16:41.855
And Eddie Vedder, from Pearl Jam,
had done the same thing.

16:41.891 --> 16:43.552
And we said, "Cool,

16:43.592 --> 16:46.720
"Let's put together a tour
where Eddie's other band,

16:46.762 --> 16:50.163
"they were called Hovercraft,
my band - Foo Fighters,

16:50.199 --> 16:54.192
"would open up for Watt,
and we would all be his band."

16:54.837 --> 16:59.797
It was just this, like,
revolving cast of musicians.

16:59.842 --> 17:02.402
Each song would have a different line-up.

17:08.818 --> 17:12.049
Instead of getting a bus for the first tour...
"We'll get a van."

17:12.088 --> 17:16.752
I'd never done a bus tour, so to me it was
totally obvious, "Yeah, we'll get a van.

17:16.791 --> 17:21.194
"What, we get to buy a brand new one?
Ha! Awesome!"

17:33.375 --> 17:35.707
We played six shows a week,

17:35.744 --> 17:40.443
and the places held maybe anywhere
from 3OO to 6OO people,

17:40.483 --> 17:44.579
and Foo Fighters were making
5OO bucks a night or something like that.

17:50.392 --> 17:53.589
As the tour was going on,
the venues were getting bigger,

17:53.629 --> 17:58.862
and we started having that
really nice but weird sort of pressure.

18:19.822 --> 18:24.816
There was a lot of attention,
because it was Dave's first tour after Nirvana.

18:24.860 --> 18:29.354
The shows had
all of these Nirvana fans that came.

18:29.398 --> 18:32.390
They didn't know the songs
because the record hadn't been out yet.

18:32.434 --> 18:35.767
So there was a song called Marigold
by Nirvana,

18:35.804 --> 18:38.034
that Dave had written and sang on.

18:38.073 --> 18:41.406
It was the only thing they knew to yell out
when we were playing.

18:41.443 --> 18:43.911
So you'd just hear, "Marigold!"

18:43.946 --> 18:46.506
Marigold! Marigold! Marigold!

18:49.218 --> 18:50.879
Shut up!

18:50.920 --> 18:52.182
And we never played it.

18:52.221 --> 18:54.451
How weird that must have been for Dave.

18:54.490 --> 18:55.980
Arriving in record stores Tuesday

18:56.025 --> 18:59.051
was one of the most buzzed-about
new releases of the year,

18:59.094 --> 19:03.827
the self-titled debut album by Nirvana drummer
Dave Grohl's new band, Foo Fighters,

19:03.866 --> 19:06.334
who wowed crowds
on Mike Watt's recent club tour.

19:06.368 --> 19:10.236
Personally, to me, it was a big deal
when that record came out,

19:10.272 --> 19:16.006
because rather than go in
and record something as a band,

19:16.045 --> 19:18.639
we used the stuff I had recorded on my own.

19:19.281 --> 19:22.739
That cassette.
That's the first record.

19:28.757 --> 19:32.124
Making their network television debut
right here with us,

19:32.161 --> 19:35.153
we couldn't be happier,
ladies and gentlemen, Foo Fighters.

19:50.746 --> 19:52.270
Hi, Jena!

19:58.087 --> 19:59.452
And the winner is...

19:59.488 --> 20:01.285
Foo Fighters, Big Me.

20:08.330 --> 20:12.528
I would like to think of this award
as some sort of closure, it's...

20:12.568 --> 20:17.198
Stop throwing Mentos at us at our shows.
That's what I'm trying to say.

20:32.755 --> 20:35.246
There were lots of interviews and,
you know,

20:35.291 --> 20:37.418
Dave not wanting to talk about Nirvana.

20:37.459 --> 20:40.394
Every question in every interview
was about Nirvana.

20:40.429 --> 20:45.093
You can imagine what they were,
like, "Is this song about Kurt?"

20:45.134 --> 20:48.570
Take any song from the record.
"Is that song about Kurt Cobain?"

20:57.112 --> 21:00.741
What's it like to be at a press conference
and not be asked any questions?

21:00.783 --> 21:03.251
Fine with me,
because I didn't wanna answer

21:03.285 --> 21:05.150
any of the questions that were asked.

21:11.460 --> 21:15.829
There were some people
that really resented me for starting this band.

21:16.398 --> 21:19.367
"How dare you fucking start another band."

21:19.401 --> 21:23.531
They asked me, like,
"Why did you decide to carry on

21:23.572 --> 21:25.836
"and make music that sounds like Nirvana?"

21:25.874 --> 21:27.569
I said, "Well, wait a minute.

21:27.609 --> 21:31.375
"What do you mean,
like loud rock guitars and melodies

21:31.413 --> 21:36.407
"and cymbals crashing and big-ass drums?

21:38.187 --> 21:39.950
"'Cause that's what I do.

21:39.988 --> 21:45.585
"That's... I was in that band and this is, like...
That's what I do.

21:45.627 --> 21:47.993
"You want me to fuckin' make
a reggae record?"

21:48.797 --> 21:50.890
The first couple years,

21:50.933 --> 21:54.164
I really felt like I had to explain
and defend what I was doing,

21:54.203 --> 21:57.070
because, first of all,
"You're just a drummer.

21:57.106 --> 21:59.165
"And, what, you're trying to sing?

21:59.208 --> 22:03.508
"And also, you were in Nirvana,
so what the fuck is this shit?"

22:04.613 --> 22:08.709
So there's a... You just get to the point
where you just think,

22:10.652 --> 22:12.415
"Fuck you people."

22:45.487 --> 22:48.251
I wasn't sure what was gonna happen.
"Can Dave write more songs?

22:48.290 --> 22:52.351
"How is the writing process gonna work?
Will we suck?"

22:52.394 --> 22:54.919
I had no idea.
"Does this band have a future?"

22:54.963 --> 22:57.898
I knew we were gonna be OK
and be able to continue

22:57.933 --> 23:01.266
after I heard the song My Hero,
'cause it was great.

23:13.749 --> 23:17.014
There were some songs
that we just started writing

23:17.052 --> 23:18.610
and throwing into the set.

23:18.654 --> 23:22.681
There were only a couple songs that we had
that were really good openers.

23:25.427 --> 23:28.419
I thought, "God, I need to write
an opening song for us."

23:28.497 --> 23:31.933
In Europe and in England,
when bands play

23:31.967 --> 23:35.198
the audience don't beat the shit out
of each other like they do in America.

23:35.237 --> 23:37.797
They do this bounce, right?
Everybody bounces.

23:37.840 --> 23:39.705
So I wanted to write a song

23:39.741 --> 23:42.073
that everyone would start bouncing to

23:42.110 --> 23:44.305
when we first came out and played.

23:44.346 --> 23:47.907
So I had a melody and a riff idea,
but I didn't know the tempo.

23:47.950 --> 23:53.149
So I jumped up and down,
and I found a tempo by, like, bouncing.

23:53.188 --> 23:55.156
The tempo should be this...

23:59.361 --> 24:03.127
I wrote the song, brought it to sound check,
said, "I have this new song.

24:03.165 --> 24:07.363
"Let's learn it, so we can open with it
tomorrow night or tonight."

24:07.402 --> 24:09.097
We sound checked, ran through it,

24:09.137 --> 24:12.971
the next night we opened with that song,
the audience was going...

24:13.008 --> 24:14.202
It worked.

24:29.191 --> 24:31.853
It's like, "Wow, cool. Let's keep it."

25:17.706 --> 25:22.234
We played, like,
18,OOO shows in one year.

25:22.277 --> 25:25.303
I'm exaggerating, but it felt like.

25:25.814 --> 25:27.475
Then we just toured a lot!

25:30.986 --> 25:33.352
Pat was keeping track,
Pat was always...

25:33.388 --> 25:37.950
Every other day he'd look at me and be like,
"12 months. 13 months. 16 months."

25:37.993 --> 25:39.620
I was just like...

25:39.661 --> 25:43.427
I remember each time he would tell me
I'd be like, "No fuckin' way!"

25:43.465 --> 25:45.490
We've been on tour for so long.

25:45.534 --> 25:47.661
We've been a band for almost a year now,

25:47.703 --> 25:52.402
and I'd say about seven months
out of that year has been spent on the road.

25:52.441 --> 25:56.537
I wasn't some kid who was just like,
"Yeah!" at that point.

25:56.578 --> 26:01.072
It was just kind of like, you know...
I'm older and I'm lazier...

26:01.116 --> 26:02.344
What?

26:02.384 --> 26:06.480
...and still I'm playing the same 2O songs
2 or 3OO nights a year.

26:06.521 --> 26:08.148
This song's called For All The Cows.

26:08.190 --> 26:10.556
This song is called
For All The Cows.

26:10.592 --> 26:11.650
It's called For All The Cows.

26:11.693 --> 26:14.025
This one's called For All The Cows.

26:14.062 --> 26:16.860
This song is called
For All The Cows.

26:59.341 --> 27:02.742
The second album that we made -
The Colour And The Shape,

27:02.778 --> 27:05.611
we decided to work
with this producer named Gil Norton.

27:05.647 --> 27:10.346
And Gil, at the time,
was famous for making the Pixies records.

27:17.159 --> 27:19.150
This was my first real recording process.

27:19.194 --> 27:20.957
Now there's a producer,

27:20.996 --> 27:25.490
someone who's not just pressing play
but actually is saying, like,

27:25.534 --> 27:29.129
"I think that should be a C.
And you should also play it in time."

27:29.171 --> 27:34.973
We went into the studio with Gil
and he worked us hard, real hard.

27:35.010 --> 27:39.037
I was fucking terrible.
And William was having his own challenges.

27:39.081 --> 27:43.916
Gil called Nate and I the "rhythmless section".
So that was encouraging.

27:43.952 --> 27:46.978
I could tell, when I had
to do something a million times,

27:47.022 --> 27:48.990
that it was taking longer than I wanted,

27:49.024 --> 27:51.356
and it was my first realization -

27:51.393 --> 27:55.159
"I'm not a fully-formed musician.
I've got to keep getting better."

27:55.197 --> 27:57.961
Constantly, there was this feeling that,

27:57.999 --> 28:01.366
whatever song we were working on,
Dave had a drum...

28:01.403 --> 28:03.928
a drum part for it already,

28:03.972 --> 28:05.371
in his head or whatever.

28:05.407 --> 28:11.573
When I've written a song,
I have kind of a clear idea

28:11.613 --> 28:17.415
of where the basic root accents should lie.

28:17.452 --> 28:19.613
That's a fancy way of saying,

28:19.654 --> 28:22.589
I know what the drums should sound like

28:22.624 --> 28:25.491
in my head as I'm doing this thing.

28:26.261 --> 28:28.422
That's not necessarily fair

28:28.463 --> 28:30.693
to say that as a songwriter, you know,

28:30.732 --> 28:33.132
who's collaborating with other musicians.

28:33.168 --> 28:35.898
You're the drummer for a band

28:35.937 --> 28:38.804
where your singer is the greatest
rock 'n' roll drummer in the world,

28:38.840 --> 28:41.934
looking over your shoulder waiting for you
to do it as good as him.

28:41.977 --> 28:44.070
That's just fucked-up pressure.

28:44.112 --> 28:48.105
Regardless of how good you are,
that's just fucked-up pressure.

28:48.150 --> 28:51.642
And remember that William was a kid.
He was really young.

28:51.686 --> 28:55.349
I think that William
played the best that he could.

28:55.423 --> 28:59.416
And sometimes it was great,
and sometimes it wasn't.

28:59.461 --> 29:04.956
What sucked about all that was, you know...

29:05.000 --> 29:07.264
I don't think the drum performances
were the best.

29:07.302 --> 29:09.793
They didn't...
They weren't horrible.

29:09.838 --> 29:15.743
If I listen to a song and I don't think
it has the thing that it needs,

29:16.678 --> 29:21.172
it's not necessarily gonna get past me
and get on an album.

29:24.319 --> 29:28.619
We left Seattle, and went to Los Angeles
to a different studio

29:28.657 --> 29:30.056
to finish this thing up.

29:30.091 --> 29:31.752
And Dave comes in, he's like,

29:31.793 --> 29:33.920
"Listen, we're gonna redo..."

29:35.263 --> 29:37.731
"My Poor Brain."
Or whatever the song is.

29:37.766 --> 29:41.566
"Drum track's not quite right.
Actually, I'm doing the drums on this one.

29:41.603 --> 29:43.537
"We're just gonna redo it."

29:43.572 --> 29:46.336
William's up in Seattle
at this point in time.

29:47.175 --> 29:51.009
They'd call me down and say,
"We need you to come play guitar on a song."

29:51.046 --> 29:55.415
And I'd go down and I'd be like,
"Well, I already played this song."

29:55.483 --> 29:59.510
"Well, we did it over."
"Oh, OK."

30:00.522 --> 30:02.581
You know, do it again.

30:02.624 --> 30:05.889
I'd go home, then I'd get called again,
"Come down and play."

30:05.927 --> 30:08.327
I'm like, "All right, cool. Let's do it."

30:08.363 --> 30:11.423
"I already played this song!"
It just kept happening.

30:11.499 --> 30:13.194
"What the fuck is going on here?"

30:13.235 --> 30:15.533
And this happens three or four times,

30:15.570 --> 30:18.403
like, "Hey, we're gonna try this one again."

30:18.440 --> 30:22.774
It ended up like, "Wait a minute.
We're just doing this whole album over."

30:22.811 --> 30:25.371
I remember asking, "Does William know?"

30:25.413 --> 30:29.042
William's still up in Seattle,
so he doesn't know what's going on

30:29.084 --> 30:30.745
and that this is happening.

30:30.785 --> 30:36.280
And I'm stressing pretty hard because
that's gonna be a big problem.

30:36.324 --> 30:37.985
I was like, "What's going on?

30:38.026 --> 30:40.824
"Should I book a flight?
I should be down there."

30:40.862 --> 30:44.229
Dave calls me, like, "Don't come down here."
I was like, "Why?"

30:44.266 --> 30:49.226
He goes, "I'm redoing a couple of drum tracks."
I was like..."Whoa. OK."

30:49.271 --> 30:51.239
And I met with Nate.

30:52.374 --> 30:55.935
I said, "What's going on?
Dave's redoing a couple of the tracks?"

30:55.977 --> 30:57.774
He goes, "Is that what he told you?"

30:57.812 --> 30:59.803
I said, "Yeah."
He goes, "He redid 'em all."

30:59.848 --> 31:04.182
The conversation
that I eventually had with William

31:04.219 --> 31:09.851
was that I really wanted him
to stay in the band,

31:09.891 --> 31:12.382
and I really wanted him to be the drummer...

31:13.261 --> 31:14.455
but...

31:15.697 --> 31:18.666
I was gonna play drums on the record.

31:18.700 --> 31:21.100
I don't know whether it was management,

31:21.136 --> 31:24.697
the record company, Gil,
all of the above, Dave,

31:24.739 --> 31:28.402
that wanted him to play drums
and didn't want me to play drums,

31:28.443 --> 31:35.042
but him redoing the drum parts
has never been explained to me.

31:35.083 --> 31:36.914
It's a tough thing to talk about,

31:36.952 --> 31:41.446
because I know that William
will never forgive me

31:41.489 --> 31:43.582
for playing drums on that record.

31:43.625 --> 31:47.061
I know it.
And I wish things were different.

31:48.263 --> 31:51.460
But I felt like this is what I had to do

31:51.499 --> 31:53.592
in order to make this album happen.

31:53.635 --> 31:58.129
We talked and Dave said,
"I still want you to tour the record."

31:58.206 --> 32:02.836
And I was just like,
"Dude, I mean, I have to, you know...

32:02.877 --> 32:05.141
"As it is now, I have to rebuild my soul,

32:05.180 --> 32:07.478
"or refind it, if you know what I mean.

32:07.515 --> 32:10.109
"If I do that, it's like, 'see ya'.

32:10.151 --> 32:13.086
"So... thanks but no thanks."

32:14.723 --> 32:19.786
It was a really weird time,
and I was young.

32:21.429 --> 32:22.691
What the fuck?

32:34.743 --> 32:36.973
I heard on the radio...

32:37.012 --> 32:40.379
"Foo Fighters drummer has left the band."

32:42.317 --> 32:44.046
I was like, "Whoa! Really?

32:44.085 --> 32:46.815
"I wonder if they have a drummer yet?"

32:46.855 --> 32:51.019
I remember vividly my brother saying,
"You should be in this band."

32:51.059 --> 32:54.893
I was like, "Well, fuck, yeah,
that'd be great, wouldn't it?

32:54.929 --> 32:59.764
"I would love to have been in the Who,
Jane's Addiction and Led Zeppelin too."

33:08.076 --> 33:12.376
Around that time, Taylor Hawkins
was playing drums with Alanis Morissette.

33:12.414 --> 33:14.780
And she was blowing up.

33:16.785 --> 33:21.381
I'd seen him play before, and there's no
question the dude's a monster on the drums.

33:21.423 --> 33:26.690
It's funny, 'cause back there's Taylor
just fuckin' like... Just fuckin' killing it.

33:26.728 --> 33:27.752
Like, "Oh my God!"

33:27.796 --> 33:33.166
We all loved Taylor, but he was in a band,
the biggest band around at the time.

33:33.201 --> 33:36.534
We were kind of in a pinch.
We had just recorded this record,

33:36.571 --> 33:39.165
and we had to go out and start doing shit.

33:39.707 --> 33:43.700
So Dave calls him up, like,
"Hey, man, do you know any good drummers?"

33:43.745 --> 33:48.148
I was like, "Yeah. I'll be your fuckin' drummer!
Let me try out."

33:48.183 --> 33:52.483
I remember saying to Taylor, "You realize
we're not as big as Alanis Morissette?"

33:52.520 --> 33:55.546
I'm like, "I know, but I wanna be in a band.

33:55.590 --> 33:58.650
"I wanna be part of something like that."
So he said,

33:58.693 --> 34:04.529
"Well, if you try out, and if we jam and...
You have to be in the band."

34:04.566 --> 34:08.058
Dave called me like, "Remember Taylor?"
I'm like, "Oh yeah."

34:08.136 --> 34:14.097
He's like, "Yeah, I think he'd be the drummer."
And I reacted poorly to that.

34:14.141 --> 34:18.373
I was hanging out with Dave and
me and him were bouncing off the walls,

34:18.413 --> 34:22.246
and Nate was going, "Oh no,
not another one of these fuckin' guys.

34:22.283 --> 34:24.513
"I can't take two spazzes in one band."

34:24.552 --> 34:27.748
I didn't think our personalities were compatible.

34:27.789 --> 34:32.351
He's just this, like,
outgoing Southern California surfer dude.

34:32.393 --> 34:34.418
Say somethin' funny.

34:34.462 --> 34:36.429
I don't know anything funny.

34:36.464 --> 34:39.900
I just came from a different world.
I was like, "That guy...

34:39.934 --> 34:43.893
"He is not a guy I'm gonna be in a band with.
No way."

34:43.938 --> 34:45.906
It's like, "He's really good."

34:46.975 --> 34:48.203
"OK."

34:55.283 --> 34:58.275
- I hear you got a new drummer?
- Got a new drummer.

34:58.319 --> 35:00.947
- From the Alanis Morissette band?
- That's right.

35:00.989 --> 35:04.982
His name's Taylor Hawkins, and...

35:05.026 --> 35:06.687
Is that his last name?

35:06.728 --> 35:08.355
I think it is.

35:08.396 --> 35:10.762
- He's really new!
- We just met him.

35:23.878 --> 35:25.641
So now Taylor’s in the band,

35:25.680 --> 35:28.114
and he comes in his first day of rehearsals,

35:28.149 --> 35:31.209
and Pat quits the band.

35:31.252 --> 35:33.117
Right then and there.

35:33.154 --> 35:37.989
Pat says, "Can I talk to you guys
for a second?" We said, "Yeah, sure."

35:38.026 --> 35:42.224
We walk outside and he goes,
"I gotta leave the band."

35:43.565 --> 35:46.466
I'm like, "What the fuck? Why?"

35:46.501 --> 35:50.130
I was just so sick of it.
I was just so sick of the whole thing.

35:50.171 --> 35:55.700
I didn't wanna go out on another...
you know, bazillion-show tour and...

35:55.743 --> 35:58.109
I just don't wanna do this anymore.

35:58.146 --> 36:00.239
When you join a band the first week,

36:00.281 --> 36:02.249
and one of the members decides...

36:02.283 --> 36:06.982
ever since you've been there, he's gonna quit,
you're like, "Obviously, it's me."

36:07.055 --> 36:10.684
I was shocked. I was shocked.

36:10.725 --> 36:13.523
I begged him to stay in the band.

36:13.561 --> 36:17.327
And he said,
"No, man. I'm just not into it anymore."

36:17.365 --> 36:20.391
It was right when we were
about to go out and start our tour,

36:20.435 --> 36:22.460
like, "Here's these new songs."

36:22.503 --> 36:26.530
Pat quits, and so he's kinda got us in a bad...
in a bad spot.

36:26.574 --> 36:30.601
I asked him to stay
until we could get someone to replace him.

36:30.645 --> 36:34.081
So we made a deal
that I would tour for six weeks,

36:34.115 --> 36:35.980
till the new guy was ready.

36:36.017 --> 36:39.350
But it stretched out to, I think,
six months maybe.

36:58.773 --> 37:01.173
So Pat has quit the band,
but he's still playing with us.

37:01.209 --> 37:04.645
That gives us some time
to integrate Franz Stahl,

37:04.679 --> 37:06.670
who became
the second guitar player in the band.

37:06.714 --> 37:10.343
I'd known Dave for years.
We grew up in the same city.

37:10.385 --> 37:15.152
He was in my first band,
this punk rock band called Scream.

37:19.727 --> 37:22.594
When I left Scream to join Nirvana,

37:22.630 --> 37:27.260
the one relationship that felt the most strained
was my relationship with Franz.

37:27.302 --> 37:31.329
I think that he resented me for leaving.

37:32.040 --> 37:35.737
It took a while, and then we reconciled
and we became friends again.

37:35.777 --> 37:39.873
That moment where Pat said,
"I don't wanna be in the band anymore,"

37:39.914 --> 37:42.508
I immediately thought,
"I'm gonna call Franz."

37:43.418 --> 37:45.978
I was on tour in Japan

37:46.020 --> 37:49.456
and I get the phone call from Dave

37:49.490 --> 37:54.086
and... he wants to know
if I'd like to join the Foo Fighters.

37:54.128 --> 37:57.256
There wasn't any sort of musical audition.
I just thought,

37:57.298 --> 38:00.324
"Franz, you wanna be in the Foo Fighters?"
He said, "Yes."

38:00.368 --> 38:04.304
And then the next day
I was on the roof of Radio City Music Hall.

38:04.339 --> 38:08.207
Please give a warm welcome to Foo Fighters!

38:14.115 --> 38:18.017
We were playing at the MTV Awards,
on top of the marquee,

38:18.052 --> 38:19.485
as kind of a warm-up act.

38:19.520 --> 38:24.048
And so I played the first song,
and then I quit.

38:24.092 --> 38:26.617
And then Franz came up and he joined.

38:26.661 --> 38:28.788
It happened just so fast.

38:29.797 --> 38:33.733
And I was still jet-lagged from Japan.

38:33.768 --> 38:38.637
Hello! The last song we played
was my last song with the band.

38:38.673 --> 38:43.406
I would like to introduce you to Franz Stahl,
who will be taking over.

38:43.444 --> 38:47.608
Thank you! Rock on, guys!
Foo Fighters!

38:50.451 --> 38:53.614
It was all very new to me,
because I was used to slumming it.

38:53.654 --> 38:57.249
Sleeping on people's floors,
just getting by, you know?

38:57.291 --> 38:59.316
And this was a whole new level.

38:59.360 --> 39:03.091
When I joined the Foo Fighters, it was like,
you know, you made it.

39:03.131 --> 39:07.830
You hit it, and you were getting
recognized for it. It was awesome.

39:12.039 --> 39:16.476
Once Franz joined the band, we did
what we always did, we went on the road.

39:16.511 --> 39:19.344
We played as many places
and as many shows as we could,

39:19.380 --> 39:20.813
and it was starting to grow.

39:20.848 --> 39:23.248
Like, you could see there were 2,OOO people,

39:23.284 --> 39:26.310
3,OOO people, 4,OOO people at gigs.

39:26.354 --> 39:29.551
We were no longer playing
the afternoon slot at the festival,

39:29.590 --> 39:31.956
we were playing the evening slot.

39:31.993 --> 39:34.553
And there was a song on the radio,
Everlong,

39:34.595 --> 39:37.758
and all of a sudden
there were videos on MTV,

39:37.799 --> 39:40.131
and it was happening to us,

39:40.168 --> 39:43.069
that thing that happens to new bands
when they start to get popular.

39:56.284 --> 39:58.218
We got Franz.

39:58.286 --> 39:59.480
I indoctrinated myself.

39:59.520 --> 40:01.818
That's right. Franz joined the band on-air...

40:01.856 --> 40:03.551
That was a great big surprise.

40:03.591 --> 40:06.389
It was awesome.
It's the best year we've had as a band,

40:06.427 --> 40:09.123
and Franz is, you know...
he's the dude.

40:14.535 --> 40:16.093
I loved the first two records.

40:16.137 --> 40:20.597
And there wasn't a song
that I didn't enjoy, you know?

40:20.641 --> 40:26.170
And I certainly was looking forward to writing,

40:26.214 --> 40:28.580
and... you know, leaving my mark.

40:32.587 --> 40:34.555
Franz is a great guy.
And a sweet guy.

40:34.589 --> 40:37.752
And I was actually...
got really close with him.

40:37.792 --> 40:39.726
It seemed like it would be perfect.

40:40.795 --> 40:44.629
We were rehearsing and writing
at the time,

40:44.665 --> 40:49.227
and coming up with song ideas...
and Taylor and Nate and I

40:49.270 --> 40:52.762
seemed to have this thing
where we were on the same page,

40:52.807 --> 40:57.210
and we were jamming
and coming up with something together.

40:57.945 --> 41:02.905
And Franz just didn't seem to
find his place in all of that.

41:02.950 --> 41:06.147
In Scream, I wrote all the music,
the majority of it.

41:06.187 --> 41:08.348
My brother would write the lyrics.

41:08.389 --> 41:11.290
So I was always,
I was very hands-on, you know?

41:11.325 --> 41:13.452
But it was Dave's band.

41:13.494 --> 41:15.291
And he writes all the music.

41:15.363 --> 41:18.127
I was kinda leery
of pushing my ideas, you know,

41:18.165 --> 41:22.932
so I wasn't trying to be
as vocal about it.

41:24.105 --> 41:29.372
For some reason,
the four of us together wasn't right.

41:29.410 --> 41:34.438
It never congealed into feeling like a band.
It's just chemistry.

41:34.482 --> 41:37.610
We had a talk with Dave about it
and he didn't wanna hear it,

41:37.652 --> 41:39.677
but he knew what the situation was.

41:39.720 --> 41:44.714
My relationship with Franz was
much different than everybody else's.

41:44.759 --> 41:47.728
I'd known the guy since I was 18.

41:47.795 --> 41:51.424
And we had cut our teeth together.

41:52.199 --> 41:55.532
It was tough, man.
I mean, honestly, like...

41:55.570 --> 41:58.630
It was just, you know,
a great old friend of mine that,

41:58.673 --> 42:02.541
unfortunately,
I was asking to leave the band.

42:02.610 --> 42:05.602
That's not to say he's
not a fucking great musician,

42:05.680 --> 42:08.342
because, of course, everybody knows he is,

42:08.382 --> 42:13.285
but when we worked together as four people...

42:13.321 --> 42:15.721
it just didn't gel, you know?

42:17.925 --> 42:20.018
We got on some kind of conference call

42:20.061 --> 42:23.326
and told him we were
gonna get a different guitar player.

42:23.364 --> 42:26.765
There was a lot of sadness and drama.
It was ugly.

42:26.801 --> 42:28.826
Basically, I got a phone call.

42:31.138 --> 42:33.038
I got a fucking phone call.

42:34.342 --> 42:36.674
And it just all ends right there.

42:38.179 --> 42:41.512
I don't even know how to react,
you know?

42:41.549 --> 42:45.076
There's just no nice way of saying,
"You're out of the band."

42:48.522 --> 42:52.322
I'm not exactly sure what happened.

42:54.295 --> 42:56.320
You know, I was in the band...

42:56.364 --> 42:58.992
and, for whatever reason,
I was out of the band.

42:59.600 --> 43:05.470
But, I mean, it was the best two years
of my life, you know?

43:06.607 --> 43:09.075
Most bands go through the same shit

43:09.110 --> 43:13.410
that we had been through
up until that point.

43:13.447 --> 43:15.574
Before anybody's ever heard of them.

43:15.616 --> 43:21.179
Unfortunately, we went through all of
those embarrassing growing pains in public.

43:23.124 --> 43:26.423
By 1998, I would sit down
to do an interview, and people'd say,

43:26.460 --> 43:29.554
"OK, so fuckin'...
Who's in the band right now?

43:29.597 --> 43:32.623
"Has anybody else left
in the last month and a half?"

43:32.667 --> 43:34.498
But there was always Nate.

43:37.405 --> 43:39.771
I was staying at my mother's house,

43:39.807 --> 43:41.775
and I got a call from Nate.

43:44.645 --> 43:48.547
I said, "What's up, man?"
He goes, "I gotta leave the band."

43:48.582 --> 43:51.710
And I just thought,
"Oh, Jesus fucking Christ."

43:51.752 --> 43:53.219
I said, "OK."

43:53.254 --> 43:54.721
At this point...

43:54.755 --> 43:58.714
my response to a member leaving
was like, "All right, why?"

44:01.996 --> 44:04.328
Sunny Day Real Estate
had gotten back together.

44:04.365 --> 44:07.232
I had a lot of really formative
experiences with them,

44:07.268 --> 44:09.133
so I had this like...

44:09.837 --> 44:13.739
high-school crush, kind of irrational...

44:13.774 --> 44:16.868
attraction to that project.

44:18.679 --> 44:21.614
And I was tortured, and I called up Dave.

44:21.649 --> 44:23.549
And I was fuckin' pissed.

44:23.584 --> 44:27.850
I think I told him, "OK, you know what?
Call everyone and tell 'em you quit.

44:27.888 --> 44:29.981
"I'm gonna go fuckin' get drunk."

44:30.024 --> 44:33.084
As soon as I got off the phone,
I knew it was the wrong thing to do,

44:33.127 --> 44:35.994
that I was gonna be happier in Foo Fighters.

44:36.030 --> 44:38.157
It was a better thing for me to do.

44:38.199 --> 44:41.794
I called a couple friends...
"I quit the band and I feel weird about it."

44:41.836 --> 44:43.497
"Yeah, 'cause that was a dumb idea."

44:43.537 --> 44:47.132
Me and my buddy Jimmy
took my rental car out to Ribsters,

44:48.242 --> 44:52.804
we got fuckin' shitfaced,
rallied my rental car,

44:52.847 --> 44:55.782
fuckin' threw rocks at it all night,
busted out windows,

44:55.816 --> 44:59.445
drove over people's lawns,
and I wound up stumbling home

44:59.487 --> 45:04.515
and woke up at seven in the morning
in the bedroom that I grew up in as a kid,

45:04.558 --> 45:07.652
with my mom saying,
"David, Nate's on the phone!"

45:09.697 --> 45:11.688
I called him the next morning at 6 am.

45:11.732 --> 45:14.292
I was wigged out
and I think it caught him off guard.

45:14.335 --> 45:17.304
"I don't really wanna quit the band.
I don't know what I was thinking."

45:17.338 --> 45:19.067
He's like, "Good."

45:19.106 --> 45:24.043
I was like, "Yeah.
This is better. Sorry about that."

45:24.078 --> 45:26.876
I was still wasted, too.
I was just lying in bed, like,

45:26.914 --> 45:30.008
"I love you, man.
I'm glad you don't wanna quit."

45:36.957 --> 45:41.690
So we decided that we're gonna make
this next record as a three-piece.

45:45.566 --> 45:48.558
We had just made
this super hyper-produced record,

45:48.602 --> 45:50.866
which we slaved over
and lost two band members.

45:50.905 --> 45:55.467
I thought, "I'm gonna buy a house in Virginia,
build a studio in the basement,

45:55.509 --> 45:59.070
"and we're gonna make this record
without any fuckin' record company

45:59.113 --> 46:02.082
"and no pressure,
and no one telling us what to do."

46:09.657 --> 46:12.285
It was different,
just having the three of us there,

46:12.326 --> 46:15.261
we were starting to form
a good identity for the band.

46:28.375 --> 46:33.278
That's when Dave was first starting to become
more comfortable as a lyric writer.

46:46.227 --> 46:50.220
A song like Ain't It The Life,
without realizing what I was doing,

46:50.264 --> 46:55.634
I was kind of making this wish list
of all the things in life I wish I had.

47:05.813 --> 47:08.304
We weren't really on a major deadline,

47:08.349 --> 47:12.843
our friend Adam Kasper was down there
engineering and co-producing.

47:15.990 --> 47:18.720
I did all of those vocals sitting on a couch.

47:18.759 --> 47:21.523
It was just a laid-back record, and you hear it.

47:23.797 --> 47:24.991
And the Grammy goes to...

47:25.032 --> 47:26.090
And the Grammy
goes to...

47:26.133 --> 47:27.760
Learn To Fly, Foo Fighters.

47:27.801 --> 47:30.770
There Is Nothing Left To Lose,
Foo Fighters.

47:30.804 --> 47:32.772
We won three Grammys for that record.

47:32.806 --> 47:35.138
I remember standing there
at the podium making the speech,

47:35.175 --> 47:38.508
looking out at all those people
in tuxedos and diamonds and shit,

47:38.545 --> 47:41.378
thinking, "I bet you this is
the only record made in a basement

47:41.415 --> 47:43.246
"that's gonna win a Grammy this year."

47:43.284 --> 47:45.081
And I was so fuckin' proud.

47:45.119 --> 47:47.883
Take care,
thank you very much, everybody.

47:49.890 --> 47:54.156
Roll camera. OK, and roll sound.
Roll playback!

47:59.700 --> 48:03.033
We take our music really seriously,
but music videos?

48:03.070 --> 48:05.265
They're commercials.
They're candy commercials.

48:05.306 --> 48:08.867
So why not make fun of the process?

48:14.848 --> 48:18.181
But once we got into it,
I started having fun with it.

48:18.218 --> 48:21.676
And it became a trademark for this band.

48:25.492 --> 48:27.824
We try not to take ourselves too seriously.

48:27.861 --> 48:30.989
In videos a lot of times,
you could easily get caught up in that,

48:31.031 --> 48:32.726
"We're playing on a mountaintop."

48:32.766 --> 48:35.132
The wind's blowing in your hair,

48:35.169 --> 48:38.332
and then an eagle flies down
and lands on your shoulder.

48:38.405 --> 48:40.270
Or some, you know, like...

48:53.887 --> 48:56.981
I just think that's sort of
an outlet of our humor.

48:59.860 --> 49:04.388
I mean, I've seen Dave do stuff on videos,
where he's bein' such a fuckin' goofball.

49:04.431 --> 49:05.762
I'm not as good at it.

49:17.378 --> 49:20.438
You know, I did try to make us a trio.

49:20.481 --> 49:23.075
Dude, Police! They're a trio!

49:23.117 --> 49:27.110
Musically, we needed more.
More guitar.

49:27.154 --> 49:31.853
Part of the sound of the Foo Fighters
is a lot of guitars. It's just part of the sound.

49:31.892 --> 49:33.951
We argue about it
every time we mix a record,

49:33.994 --> 49:36.656
'cause I always want the drums louder,
and Dave's like,

49:36.697 --> 49:39.029
"It's the Foo Fighters.
The guitars are really loud."

49:39.066 --> 49:41.762
None of us had the right guy that was a friend,

49:41.802 --> 49:44.134
or a friend of a friend...
It wasn't handy.

49:44.171 --> 49:46.969
So we had to have open auditions
for a guitar player.

49:47.007 --> 49:50.943
Pin a note at the Guitar Center, like,
"Guitar player wanted for Foo Fighters."

49:50.978 --> 49:52.912
We wound up in this rehearsal space,

49:52.946 --> 49:56.677
and I just remember
this line of guitar players.

49:56.717 --> 49:58.810
And I was terrified.

50:01.088 --> 50:04.785
It sounded great. I mean, I dig it.
Nice meeting you for the first time.

50:04.825 --> 50:07.350
Hopefully see you again soon.

50:07.394 --> 50:09.294
There's the guy that came in
and hugged everybody.

50:09.329 --> 50:13.732
It was like, "Hi. Hi."
It was like...

50:14.701 --> 50:17.727
There was one kid that came in,
he was so nervous.

50:17.771 --> 50:21.229
He came in, and was like, "What's up?
Will you sign something for me?"

50:21.275 --> 50:24.301
He just immediately wanted us
to sign some shit.

50:24.344 --> 50:28.212
We were like, "Yeah, dude, cool it.
It's cool, you know? Just relax.

50:28.248 --> 50:30.341
"Let's hang, you know? Let's talk."

50:31.251 --> 50:33.845
And we hung out and talked a little bit.

50:33.887 --> 50:37.618
And then he went to open up his guitar case,
and it was locked.

50:37.658 --> 50:41.424
He had a brand new guitar,
a brand new case,

50:41.462 --> 50:44.954
and he fucking locked his guitar in it.

50:44.998 --> 50:46.795
And didn't have a key.

50:49.736 --> 50:53.035
We literally did, like,
a week or two of tryouts.

50:53.073 --> 50:56.440
There was one point where it was getting
a little dire, we were like, "Fuck!"

50:56.477 --> 50:59.378
A good friend of mine called me and said,

50:59.413 --> 51:03.543
"Hey, I heard Guns N' Roses
are auditioning guitar players,

51:03.584 --> 51:06.018
"and I think I could get you an audition."

51:06.053 --> 51:09.682
And I was like, "Well, I don't wanna audition
for Guns N' Roses."

51:09.723 --> 51:13.181
But I said, "But I heard the Foo Fighters
guitar player quit.

51:13.227 --> 51:15.923
"Try to get me an audition with Foo Fighters."

51:15.963 --> 51:17.828
Everyone, shake hands with Chris.

51:17.865 --> 51:18.889
Chris!

51:20.801 --> 51:23.861
When Chris came in to audition,

51:23.904 --> 51:27.067
we somehow came to the realization

51:27.107 --> 51:33.273
that we met when we were kids
at a punk rock show in Santa Barbara.

51:33.313 --> 51:35.474
Years and years before any of this,

51:35.516 --> 51:38.178
when Dave had been the drummer in Scream,

51:38.218 --> 51:40.880
and I was playing bass
in a band called Rat Pack.

51:40.921 --> 51:42.616
We actually opened up for them.

51:42.656 --> 51:47.116
The fact that he was a part of
that underground punk rock thing

51:47.161 --> 51:48.651
was really important to me.

51:58.205 --> 52:01.936
So we bonded pretty instantly,
because I thought,

52:01.975 --> 52:07.504
"He's gonna get it. He's gonna understand,
and he won't take this shit for granted."

52:13.120 --> 52:14.747
Very good, that's very good, man.

52:20.494 --> 52:24.089
He could sing, and he was a shredder,
and he was a good guy,

52:24.131 --> 52:27.123
and he'd been in bands,

52:27.167 --> 52:30.193
and he didn't smell,
and he was awesome.

52:30.237 --> 52:33.673
So the next day, just all day,
I just sat there by the phone.

52:33.707 --> 52:36.471
And at like, around five or six,
the phone rang

52:36.510 --> 52:38.740
and it was Dave and Taylor
And they said,

52:38.779 --> 52:42.977
"All right, you know, you got the gig.
We start rehearsing tomorrow.

52:43.016 --> 52:46.508
"Say goodbye to your friends, you're not
gonna see anybody for the next year."

52:46.553 --> 52:49.852
It was like, Chris joined the band
and we had our itinerary ready to go.

52:49.890 --> 52:52.654
"Ready? We're gonna leave for ten years.
Let's go."

52:52.693 --> 52:55.457
The Foos found their new best buddy
in Chris Shiflett,

52:55.495 --> 52:59.056
a former member of punk bands
No Use For A Name and 22 Jacks.

52:59.099 --> 53:01.863
I remember wanting
to help Chris feel comfortable.

53:01.902 --> 53:04.166
We went out to dinner a couple of times.

53:04.204 --> 53:07.901
Trying not to have a situation
where he comes in and it's like, "OK, go!"

53:07.941 --> 53:11.206
When I joined Nirvana,
I was the fifth drummer of Nirvana.

53:11.245 --> 53:14.703
With Chris, it was maybe the same way,
you know?

53:14.748 --> 53:17.216
He was the third guitar player
of the Foo Fighters.

53:17.251 --> 53:21.745
In the early days of being in the band
I didn't wanna step on anybody's toes.

53:21.788 --> 53:25.349
I didn't even know what...
I didn't know what my place was.

53:25.392 --> 53:30.193
And I was just genuinely, like,
this was everything that I ever wanted -

53:30.230 --> 53:31.595
the dream coming true.

53:38.005 --> 53:41.031
Every time Foo Fighters
would put out a record,

53:41.074 --> 53:44.703
I would get really excited
and miss it so bad.

53:48.982 --> 53:52.042
I found out after being in the band
for a couple months

53:52.085 --> 53:54.849
that they had almost replaced me with Pat.

53:54.921 --> 53:56.718
Pat almost came back,

53:56.757 --> 53:59.590
who they had a lot of history with,
and there was a relationship there.

53:59.626 --> 54:03.084
Dave didn't know that I knew that,
and probably most of them didn't.

54:03.130 --> 54:08.261
There was at least a couple times where
I called Dave and said, "I want back."

54:08.302 --> 54:11.271
Then when it looked like it might
actually happen, I got scared.

54:11.305 --> 54:14.968
After being in the band for a couple months,
I had this feeling,

54:15.008 --> 54:19.001
"This could all end,
and I'm gonna enjoy this while it lasts.

54:19.046 --> 54:22.573
"Because it probably will end
sooner than I want it to."

54:25.952 --> 54:30.412
That third record, we went on the road
with the Red Hot Chili Peppers.

54:31.591 --> 54:34.424
For, like, four months
we toured America with them.

54:36.463 --> 54:38.090
We had never played arenas before.

54:38.131 --> 54:40.622
We hadn't done that arena rock thing.

54:48.308 --> 54:51.766
That's when we started
coming up with jams onstage

54:51.812 --> 54:54.178
and working out, like, a show.

54:54.214 --> 54:57.206
Not a "show,"
not dancers and shit in the show,

54:57.250 --> 55:01.812
but really like kinda work out a good set.
So that it's impressive.

55:05.425 --> 55:07.791
Taylor really drove that home.
It was great.

55:07.828 --> 55:11.821
That changed the band, probably, forever
and made us concentrate more

55:11.865 --> 55:13.696
on really playing together.

55:13.734 --> 55:18.398
We had a stage setup
that we had built for the arena.

55:18.438 --> 55:22.067
It was basically modeled after
the Queen Live Killers record cover,

55:22.109 --> 55:23.474
it was very seventies.

55:23.510 --> 55:27.139
Hi. This is our dressing room,
where we get dressed before we play.

55:27.180 --> 55:29.410
And we had these little uniforms set.

55:29.449 --> 55:31.349
And we brought a wardrobe case

55:31.385 --> 55:35.879
Everything was red and black, or white.
That was our color theme for the tour.

55:35.922 --> 55:39.119
It was the first time we thought
in terms of something like,

55:39.159 --> 55:41.252
"Let's look a certain way on stage."

55:41.294 --> 55:43.819
I had the black shirt with white tie
and black pants.

55:43.864 --> 55:46.025
Nate had the red shirt with black tie and...

55:46.066 --> 55:48.864
We looked like Kraftwerk
or something like that.

55:48.902 --> 55:50.836
We were... It was silly, really.

55:52.539 --> 55:56.373
But we put on this show,
and we fuckin' killed it.

56:01.481 --> 56:06.248
OK, we'll see you guys in a town near you,
I hope very soon.

56:06.286 --> 56:08.277
Take care and...

56:09.356 --> 56:10.482
I love you.

56:22.102 --> 56:26.835
It just stands to reason no matter how great
a thing that your life or your job is,

56:26.873 --> 56:29.068
after a while, you need a break.

56:37.517 --> 56:40.145
That was fun
until after two months of doing it.

56:40.187 --> 56:43.179
It feels like Groundhog Day,
all those arenas look the same.

56:43.223 --> 56:46.624
You start bringing the bottle of whisky
to the stage with you.

56:50.697 --> 56:54.599
It started with, "Let's do a shot
before we play." We'd call it "band prayer".

56:54.634 --> 56:58.866
Then that turned into like,
"Let's do ten shots before we play."

57:01.741 --> 57:05.336
And we all started gettin' fuckin' hammered
before we went onstage.

57:06.246 --> 57:08.737
And we got really shitty by the end.

57:11.351 --> 57:16.618
I think that's probably why so many musicians
wind up getting so fucked up,

57:16.656 --> 57:19.921
just 'cause you need something to keep it fun.

57:22.262 --> 57:24.992
Taylor had been struggling with...

57:25.765 --> 57:27.596
with drugs, I think.

57:28.335 --> 57:30.701
He and I had talked about it a few times.

57:30.737 --> 57:35.470
I didn't really know how to deal
with the way you were supposed to be.

57:35.509 --> 57:41.470
I thought that to be a rock 'n' roller
you have to be the fuckin' Keith Richards.

57:41.515 --> 57:45.178
You have to be the dark, partying, fuckin'...
the real deal.

57:46.786 --> 57:50.244
That's the only way it's real rock 'n' roll.

57:50.290 --> 57:50.949
Rock 'n' roll!

57:50.991 --> 57:55.587
I would tell him, I'd say,
"You know, dude, I love you like a brother.

57:56.863 --> 57:59.855
"I'm not a cop. I'm not your dad, whatever.

57:59.900 --> 58:02.698
"But I'm worried about you, you know?"

58:08.508 --> 58:09.998
We were in London,

58:10.043 --> 58:13.501
and we all went out to a bar
across the street from the hotel.

58:13.547 --> 58:16.744
We were having a good time,
and I came back to my room early.

58:18.018 --> 58:23.012
And in the morning I got a call
that he was on his way to the hospital.

58:24.324 --> 58:28.522
We got word that Taylor’s in a coma
at the hospital,

58:28.562 --> 58:31.224
and OD'd on, you know,
whatever it was.

58:31.264 --> 58:33.289
I think it was heroin that he did.

58:34.668 --> 58:40.265
And our sound man at the time,
he was like, "Oh yeah, Taylor fucked up.

58:40.307 --> 58:43.071
"He's gonna die, like, he's fuckin' dead."

58:46.546 --> 58:51.415
It was so weird, like, he hadn't died,
but he had overdosed.

58:52.485 --> 58:53.816
And...

58:55.522 --> 58:58.218
I just felt so totally helpless,
you know?

59:16.309 --> 59:18.209
What sort of things do you demand on tour?

59:18.244 --> 59:20.235
Instruments.

59:22.182 --> 59:24.377
So I sat with him...

59:24.417 --> 59:27.147
for those couple weeks.

59:28.455 --> 59:30.514
Until he woke up.

59:30.557 --> 59:33.958
And when he woke up,

59:33.994 --> 59:36.929
I said to him,
"Dude, it's gonna be OK."

59:36.963 --> 59:40.057
And he looked at me and he said, "Fuck off!"

59:40.100 --> 59:43.934
And I thought,
"Oh, good, everything's gonna be OK."

59:43.970 --> 59:45.232
Dave's my best friend.

59:45.271 --> 59:49.674
And even more than a best friend,
he's like a brother. He really is.

59:49.709 --> 59:52.974
And, yeah, he was...
as I would be with him,

59:53.747 --> 59:58.013
if something happened to Dave
where he was on the brink of death,

59:58.084 --> 01:00:00.780
I would be losing my mind.

01:00:00.820 --> 01:00:02.754
And he was losing his mind.

01:00:07.127 --> 01:00:11.063
So we get back from London
after my fuckin' OD,

01:00:11.097 --> 01:00:15.557
and then two months after that,
we start trying to make this record.

01:00:15.602 --> 01:00:19.663
But we weren't ready.
And nobody's really into it.

01:00:20.273 --> 01:00:22.138
Everyone's playing half-assed.

01:00:22.175 --> 01:00:25.042
I'd do something
and Dave would listen and say,

01:00:25.078 --> 01:00:29.208
"This has gotta change. This is not working
with the vocals. That's too busy."

01:00:29.249 --> 01:00:32.218
I was disagreeing.
I had a shitty attitude 'cause I was pissed.

01:00:32.252 --> 01:00:35.380
It was bizarre.
It was my first record with the band.

01:00:35.422 --> 01:00:38.186
And I was just
showing up to the studio every day

01:00:38.224 --> 01:00:42.524
and was sort of confused, like,
"It's weird, I'm never playing on this.

01:00:42.562 --> 01:00:45.554
"I show up at noon every day
and I kinda sit here

01:00:45.598 --> 01:00:49.659
"and I eat food and drink coffee
and then I go home.

01:00:49.703 --> 01:00:50.965
"What is this?"

01:00:51.004 --> 01:00:52.801
There's starting to...

01:00:52.839 --> 01:00:55.137
There's a little bit of infighting

01:00:55.175 --> 01:00:58.736
and whispers of, "Blah-blah's pissed
at blah-blah about wah-dah."

01:00:58.778 --> 01:01:01.269
And the vibes just were not happening.

01:01:01.314 --> 01:01:04.408
Dave's like, "I feel like you guys
are taking the band for granted.

01:01:04.451 --> 01:01:07.852
"It's just, show up, make a record,
and go on and do our thing.

01:01:07.887 --> 01:01:11.516
"There's no... You don't have
to show up with a passion for it."

01:01:11.558 --> 01:01:12.547
And he had a point.

01:01:12.592 --> 01:01:18.553
I would walk in,
listen to what we have, and think,

01:01:18.598 --> 01:01:22.193
"I don't really know
if I want anyone to hear this."

01:01:22.235 --> 01:01:25.466
The making of that record was a fuckin'...
It sucked.

01:01:25.505 --> 01:01:27.473
We finished it, and...

01:01:27.507 --> 01:01:30.442
we gave it to our manager, John Silva,

01:01:30.477 --> 01:01:33.071
and he was like,
"Well, we could put this out,

01:01:33.113 --> 01:01:36.674
"but I don't know if we're gonna be able
to sell any of them."

01:01:44.991 --> 01:01:46.219
Immediately following that,

01:01:46.259 --> 01:01:48.887
Dave had done a record with
Queens of the Stone Age as their drummer,

01:01:48.928 --> 01:01:50.953
and went out and toured on that record.

01:01:50.997 --> 01:01:52.897
And was like, "I'm gonna go do this.

01:01:52.932 --> 01:01:58.029
"We'll figure out what we're gonna do about
this record that didn't work later."

01:01:58.872 --> 01:02:01.773
Dave's not happy with the record
and he wants to shelve it.

01:02:01.808 --> 01:02:04.606
And he's also gonna go on tour
with Queens of the Stone Age.

01:02:04.644 --> 01:02:08.341
And so it was kind of like,
"Whoa. He's doing what?

01:02:08.381 --> 01:02:11.578
"You know, what are we doing again?
What did you say?"

01:02:16.656 --> 01:02:19.682
I just started to think that we should stop.

01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:22.460
"I don't have to be here,

01:02:22.495 --> 01:02:26.295
"and I really fuckin' love
doing this other thing, so...

01:02:27.467 --> 01:02:28.456
"fuck it."

01:02:28.501 --> 01:02:31.698
He went off with Queens,
and that went on for a little while.

01:02:31.738 --> 01:02:35.071
Then we got together to rehearse,
to go play Coachella.

01:02:35.108 --> 01:02:37.702
We were signed on to do this show,

01:02:37.744 --> 01:02:40.042
where Dave was playing with Queens
the day before,

01:02:40.079 --> 01:02:41.376
and then we were playing.

01:02:41.414 --> 01:02:42.938
There was so much tension.

01:02:42.982 --> 01:02:46.577
Nobody was talking, and we were
just rehearsing to get through these songs.

01:02:46.619 --> 01:02:49.110
God bless him, Chris at one point in time
in the rehearsal just goes,

01:02:49.155 --> 01:02:50.884
"I don't know if I'm the only one,

01:02:50.924 --> 01:02:53.552
"but you could cut the air in here
with a fuckin' knife.

01:02:53.593 --> 01:02:55.618
"What the fuck's goin' on?"
Then it was just on.

01:02:55.662 --> 01:03:00.065
We had this big fight,
one of the biggest arguments we've ever had.

01:03:00.099 --> 01:03:01.862
It was mostly between Taylor and Dave.

01:03:01.901 --> 01:03:05.462
They had it out, like this serious discussion.
Stuff that had been pent up.

01:03:05.505 --> 01:03:09.305
When I went to play drums with Queens
of the Stone Age, Taylor resented me for that.

01:03:09.342 --> 01:03:11.401
What bands are you listening to now?

01:03:11.444 --> 01:03:15.005
The new Queens of the Stone Age CD
is amazing, everybody knows that.

01:03:15.048 --> 01:03:17.608
He was really upset that
I didn't come see him play drums

01:03:17.650 --> 01:03:21.086
and how exciting it was
for him to be back onstage

01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:25.557
playing with another band.
I just went through this awful trauma,

01:03:25.592 --> 01:03:28.220
and I was supposed to be happy

01:03:28.294 --> 01:03:31.889
that Dave's having such a good time.
But I wasn't, you know?

01:03:31.931 --> 01:03:35.230
"I'm not fucking happy
for you to go play with another band.

01:03:35.268 --> 01:03:37.793
"Why should I be happy for that?"

01:03:37.837 --> 01:03:40.601
So Dave was trying to write
the set list for the show,

01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:42.631
and we had an argument about it, just,

01:03:42.675 --> 01:03:46.133
"You're a fuckin' asshole."
"If you don't like it, you can leave!"

01:03:46.179 --> 01:03:50.138
And the next day, I said,
"I will be leaving. As soon as we finish this.

01:03:50.183 --> 01:03:52.913
"As soon as we play Coachella
and finish this record,

01:03:52.952 --> 01:03:55.318
"do whatever commitments we have,
I'm out of here."

01:03:55.355 --> 01:03:58.119
"Look, let's go and do this show,

01:03:58.157 --> 01:04:00.853
"and if we never wanna do it again,
then let's not."

01:04:00.894 --> 01:04:04.762
"The Foo Fighters are over.
And I'm OK with that."

01:04:04.797 --> 01:04:08.460
"OK. That's it. Oh well."

01:04:15.275 --> 01:04:17.209
I played two nights at that Coachella.

01:04:17.243 --> 01:04:21.111
One with the Foo Fighters,
and one with Queens of the Stone Age.

01:04:21.147 --> 01:04:25.675
And Taylor sat and watched Queens
of the Stone Age that night, at Coachella.

01:04:26.586 --> 01:04:29.350
At that point, I was OK with it.
I didn't care anymore.

01:04:29.389 --> 01:04:33.257
I was like, "Well, this is probably
our last show, so, you know,

01:04:33.293 --> 01:04:36.990
"maybe Dave will just end up being
Queens of the Stone Age drummer for now

01:04:37.030 --> 01:04:39.430
"or whatever,
and that'll be what it is."

01:04:41.634 --> 01:04:44.194
And then we played the next day
and we played great.

01:04:50.843 --> 01:04:54.802
Dave was like, a new front man
in front of 1O, OOO, 2O, OOO people,

01:04:54.847 --> 01:04:56.815
however big that fuckin' thing is.

01:04:59.385 --> 01:05:02.718
It was really good.
After that, me and Dave went for a walk.

01:05:02.755 --> 01:05:07.920
And he said, "Let's go back to Virginia,
record a couple songs."

01:05:07.961 --> 01:05:13.490
We made a plan to meet and just jam,
see what happens.

01:05:13.533 --> 01:05:16.730
I said, "I have this new song.
It's called Times Like These."

01:05:29.415 --> 01:05:31.212
Times Like These was basically written

01:05:31.250 --> 01:05:34.515
about the band disappearing
for those two or three months.

01:05:34.554 --> 01:05:39.150
And me feeling like I wasn't entirely myself.

01:05:54.507 --> 01:05:58.068
I just thought,
"OK. I'm not done being in the band.

01:05:58.111 --> 01:06:00.375
"I don't know if they are, but I'm not."

01:06:01.647 --> 01:06:05.310
It wasn't too long before Dave was excited
to get back to work on the record.

01:06:05.351 --> 01:06:07.512
We just started picking all the songs

01:06:07.553 --> 01:06:10.078
and going, "Let's re-record that.
We have a week."

01:06:10.123 --> 01:06:13.854
And we re-recorded the album
in seven days in my basement.

01:06:17.764 --> 01:06:20.790
It was all finished really quickly,
and it had the passion,

01:06:20.833 --> 01:06:24.860
it had the feel and sound that was like...
a record we could be proud of.

01:06:24.904 --> 01:06:30.137
I remember that being like, the turning point.
Like, "OK, this isn't ending."

01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:37.608
We had already spent
three months and a million dollars

01:06:37.683 --> 01:06:40.151
on something that we threw away.

01:06:40.186 --> 01:06:45.920
The difference between
All My Life and All My Life

01:06:45.958 --> 01:06:52.557
was that this one cost a million dollars
and sounded like crap.

01:06:52.598 --> 01:06:55.692
This one,
we did in my basement in half an hour

01:06:55.735 --> 01:06:59.136
and became the biggest fuckin' song
the band ever had.

01:07:14.620 --> 01:07:17.748
It was a big record, you know?
Millions of people bought it.

01:07:17.790 --> 01:07:21.419
All My Life we just have to play
when we play gigs.

01:07:21.461 --> 01:07:24.430
To this day, that's by far
my favorite song to play live.

01:07:24.464 --> 01:07:27.160
Every night, good or bad show,
it doesn't matter,

01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:30.863
when you get to that part of the set,
it always goes bananas.

01:07:30.937 --> 01:07:34.134
If you're having a bad show,
that's the turning point every night.

01:07:44.350 --> 01:07:47.342
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome the Foo Fighters!

01:07:48.354 --> 01:07:51.016
Ladies and gentlemen, Foo Fighters.

01:07:51.057 --> 01:07:54.151
Please welcome back to the program,
Foo Fighters.

01:07:54.494 --> 01:07:55.688
Foo Fighters!

01:07:56.863 --> 01:07:58.956
Ladies and gentlemen, Foo Fighters!

01:08:18.184 --> 01:08:20.379
We barely got through making a record,

01:08:20.419 --> 01:08:23.149
and then started kinda
going up the ranks as a live band.

01:08:23.189 --> 01:08:25.919
We didn't have huge success
right up front.

01:08:25.957 --> 01:08:29.826
It's been little milestones of things
we've been asked to do and been able to do.

01:08:29.862 --> 01:08:32.729
It was a fun time.
We were doing these great tours,

01:08:32.765 --> 01:08:36.428
and the shows were getting bigger,
and we were on a good roll.

01:08:37.803 --> 01:08:41.102
We'd get asked to play on the MTV Awards,
and we'd show up,

01:08:41.140 --> 01:08:43.700
and we'd be
the only fuckin' rock band there.

01:08:43.743 --> 01:08:48.908
So it'd be like us and fuckin' boy bands,
girl bands, rappers, solo artists.

01:08:48.948 --> 01:08:51.416
After a while we got suspicious, like,

01:08:51.450 --> 01:08:55.443
"Wait a minute, do they know who we are
or do they just need a rock band?"

01:09:07.233 --> 01:09:08.495
Thank you.

01:09:21.046 --> 01:09:22.514
After One By One,

01:09:22.548 --> 01:09:26.779
I went home and started demoing
all this really delicate acoustic music.

01:09:29.988 --> 01:09:32.321
I thought, "Let's make an album

01:09:32.358 --> 01:09:37.057
"where you have one CD
that's all the really heavy rock shit,

01:09:37.095 --> 01:09:38.393
"then you have another CD

01:09:38.430 --> 01:09:42.868
"that's really beautiful
acoustic-based, lower dynamic stuff."

01:09:45.705 --> 01:09:48.868
And we'll tour for six or seven months
on the rock record,

01:09:48.908 --> 01:09:52.207
then go out on this theatre tour
doing the acoustic shows.

01:09:56.949 --> 01:10:00.146
Since the acoustic record
had additional instrumentation,

01:10:00.586 --> 01:10:02.952
I thought, "We need a bigger band."

01:10:03.689 --> 01:10:05.589
I always had in the back of my mind

01:10:05.625 --> 01:10:09.356
that someday I'll get to come
and play along with them.

01:10:10.830 --> 01:10:13.492
And in 2OO6, Dave called me and said,

01:10:13.532 --> 01:10:15.796
"Come out and do
this acoustic tour with me."

01:10:18.704 --> 01:10:20.296
I didn't actually know Pat,

01:10:20.339 --> 01:10:24.742
but I was aware that there'd been
a couple times through the years

01:10:24.777 --> 01:10:26.938
when Dave had almost brought him back.

01:10:26.979 --> 01:10:30.745
And so, to me, Pat was just a guy
that wanted my job.

01:10:30.783 --> 01:10:35.220
So when I found out about that, I was just like,
"You gotta be fuckin' kidding me."

01:10:38.190 --> 01:10:41.159
Pat is a Foo Fighter,
whether he's in the band or not.

01:10:41.193 --> 01:10:45.527
He and I have gone through a lot together.
Pat should be in the band.

01:10:46.265 --> 01:10:48.756
I definitely thought
it must be awkward for Chris.

01:10:48.801 --> 01:10:52.965
So I felt awkward only in that...
"I hope this isn't awkward for you."

01:11:02.682 --> 01:11:05.776
The first rehearsal, Pat showed up,

01:11:05.818 --> 01:11:08.651
and we actually instantly hit it off,
you know?

01:11:08.688 --> 01:11:12.385
I sorta got to be friends with him
over the course of doing those shows.

01:11:15.895 --> 01:11:19.991
Clive Davis came to see us play
at one of the acoustic gigs,

01:11:20.032 --> 01:11:23.627
and I said, "I think it'd be so cool
if we were that band

01:11:23.669 --> 01:11:27.935
"where we did the rock show and
we had all the people that love the rock show,

01:11:27.973 --> 01:11:31.067
"and we did the acoustic show and had
all the people that love the acoustic show,

01:11:31.110 --> 01:11:33.704
"and they wouldn't necessarily
have to go to both."

01:11:33.746 --> 01:11:38.479
And Clive was like,
"Yes, but you can do both together."

01:11:38.517 --> 01:11:42.817
In a total Yoda moment.
I was like, "Oh my God, you're right!"

01:11:42.855 --> 01:11:46.586
And that was the next album,
Echoes, Silence, Patience, & Grace.

01:11:46.625 --> 01:11:50.061
Those songs were basically just that.

01:11:50.096 --> 01:11:54.362
So that tour and that album before
totally shaped the one that happened after.

01:13:43.175 --> 01:13:48.306
We were at a point in our career where
we thought things couldn't get any bigger.

01:13:48.347 --> 01:13:51.510
We've headlined these festivals,
played these arenas.

01:13:51.550 --> 01:13:54.417
We're perfectly happy
with the way things are.

01:13:54.987 --> 01:13:58.923
And then John Silva said,
"You guys wanna play Wembley Stadium?"

01:13:59.458 --> 01:14:03.224
And I said, "Fuck.
OK, but wait, how big is that place?"

01:14:03.262 --> 01:14:07.392
When you do something like that
you put it on sale six months ahead of time

01:14:07.433 --> 01:14:10.231
because that's a lot of tickets -
85,OOO people.

01:14:10.269 --> 01:14:13.033
You need six months
to get rid of all those tickets.

01:14:13.072 --> 01:14:16.872
And we sold it out.
I couldn't believe it.

01:14:16.909 --> 01:14:21.175
So we put another one on sale,
and it sold out in, like, a few days.

01:14:21.213 --> 01:14:25.274
When it sold out like it did,
I think everybody in the band was just like,

01:14:25.317 --> 01:14:26.978
"What the fuck?
How did that happen?"

01:14:27.019 --> 01:14:29.783
It was this huge responsibility,
this great thing like,

01:14:29.822 --> 01:14:33.121
"All right. It's our turn now,
like, we have to make it great."

01:14:33.993 --> 01:14:36.860
It was six months
until we had to play the show.

01:14:37.496 --> 01:14:41.990
Every night before I went to sleep
for six months, I'd think,

01:14:42.034 --> 01:14:44.400
"My God,
I have to play fuckin' Wembley Stadium."

01:14:44.436 --> 01:14:47.337
Then I'd wake up in the morning,
like, "We're playing Wembley!"

01:15:02.454 --> 01:15:04.615
Wembley is so big,

01:15:04.657 --> 01:15:09.390
and it's like this sort of
monster bowl you're playing.

01:15:09.428 --> 01:15:13.626
It's just sort of the weight
and the responsibility I put on myself

01:15:13.666 --> 01:15:15.998
for a show like that, it's intense.

01:15:21.407 --> 01:15:24.740
I remember before the first show,
I was so nervous,

01:15:24.777 --> 01:15:28.440
and I somehow got hot sauce
in my eye backstage,

01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:29.708
right before we went on,

01:15:29.748 --> 01:15:34.048
I was just, "Why now?
Why did this have to happen now?"

01:15:34.086 --> 01:15:36.919
You don't just go,
"Yay, they asked us to do this thing

01:15:36.956 --> 01:15:40.687
"and we're gonna go and do our best
and see what happens."

01:15:40.726 --> 01:15:44.560
You wanna make sure it becomes
the most memorable show you've done.

01:15:44.630 --> 01:15:47.121
And know that you killed it.

01:15:54.373 --> 01:15:57.342
It was nerve-wracking,
because it's Wembley Stadium.

01:15:57.376 --> 01:16:01.312
And if you've ever been there,
it's so fucking huge.

01:16:01.347 --> 01:16:02.814
It's like an illusion.

01:16:03.949 --> 01:16:08.443
How the fuck did this band
get this fuckin' big?

01:16:08.487 --> 01:16:10.682
Can you tell me that?

01:16:57.136 --> 01:16:59.969
When you have 2O, OOO people

01:17:00.005 --> 01:17:02.599
and there's nosebleeds
that are so far away,

01:17:02.641 --> 01:17:06.441
you wanna be able to bring everybody in.

01:17:06.478 --> 01:17:09.675
I want the people up there to feel
like they're right there.

01:19:27.152 --> 01:19:30.519
You'd imagine that after playing something
like Wembley Stadium

01:19:30.556 --> 01:19:34.287
and playing to 85,OOO people,
"God, what do we do now?"

01:19:34.326 --> 01:19:35.691
Yeah, it's good.

01:19:35.727 --> 01:19:40.130
It's the same way with records, in a way.
This is our seventh record.

01:19:40.165 --> 01:19:43.999
What could we possibly do that's different
than the last thing we had done?

01:19:45.537 --> 01:19:49.200
And I thought, "Well...
I wanna do the next one in the garage."

01:19:54.079 --> 01:19:58.243
It's about making records
the way we used to fucking make records.

01:19:58.283 --> 01:20:00.945
But let's do it with Butch Vig
so it's fucking huge.

01:20:05.157 --> 01:20:11.153
Butch Vig is probably most well known
for doing Nevermind, the Nirvana record.

01:20:11.196 --> 01:20:14.029
But he's done
a ton of stuff through the years.

01:20:14.066 --> 01:20:16.762
He did the last Green Day record
and he was in Garbage,

01:20:16.802 --> 01:20:20.670
and he's been
a working producer for a long time.

01:20:20.706 --> 01:20:24.574
Dave said, "I wanna make
the record in my garage."

01:20:24.610 --> 01:20:29.513
And then he said, "What do you think
about making the record on tape?"

01:20:30.849 --> 01:20:34.683
I wanna get away
from what people think we should do.

01:20:36.455 --> 01:20:38.320
I learned how to make records on tape.

01:20:38.357 --> 01:20:41.258
And there's something
about that process that I love,

01:20:41.293 --> 01:20:45.787
but you can't fix things like
when you're working purely in a digital format.

01:20:45.831 --> 01:20:48.265
That's the first thing I said to the band.

01:20:48.300 --> 01:20:51.565
"If we're gonna do this on tape,
you guys have to play really well.

01:20:51.603 --> 01:20:53.503
"Because nothing's gonna be fixed."

01:20:56.475 --> 01:20:59.205
I think most people have an idea
of how records are made.

01:20:59.244 --> 01:21:02.407
They're made on computers.
You can do whatever with computers,

01:21:02.447 --> 01:21:04.642
but we all grew up
making records on tape.

01:21:04.683 --> 01:21:07.516
It's got a certain sound.
It's got a certain set of limitations.

01:21:07.552 --> 01:21:11.010
You can't go in and just go like,
"Well, that's close enough."

01:21:11.056 --> 01:21:13.024
Wow, this is great!

01:21:13.058 --> 01:21:15.219
Rock n' roll is imperfection and flaws

01:21:15.260 --> 01:21:19.026
and four or five or six or eight people
playing together.

01:21:19.064 --> 01:21:23.000
It's not gonna line up.
It's gonna be a little fucked up. It should be.

01:21:23.035 --> 01:21:25.367
Human beings aren't perfect.

01:21:25.404 --> 01:21:27.031
You wanna say hello?

01:21:27.072 --> 01:21:29.006
Hi!

01:21:29.041 --> 01:21:32.807
What was really different was the environment,
doing it at Dave's house.

01:21:32.844 --> 01:21:36.644
Which is the most comfortable environment
you can imagine.

01:21:36.682 --> 01:21:40.049
It's like...
It's just fun to be there anyways.

01:21:40.085 --> 01:21:43.213
I think the atmosphere of where you're
recording has to come out on the record.

01:21:43.255 --> 01:21:44.688
I don't see how it couldn't.

01:21:44.723 --> 01:21:47.317
Look at this crew.
Look at the Hawkins!

01:21:47.926 --> 01:21:50.053
What, are you kidding me?

01:21:50.095 --> 01:21:52.063
The engineers and everybody
at one point were like,

01:21:52.097 --> 01:21:54.827
"OK, we're gonna need this
and this and this.

01:21:54.866 --> 01:21:57.494
"$7OO, OOO worth of outboard gear."

01:21:57.536 --> 01:22:01.563
And Dave's like, "No, no, no.
We're making a record in a garage!"

01:22:08.714 --> 01:22:11.478
I love that we're about
to make an album at home.

01:22:11.516 --> 01:22:15.179
I think the album's gonna sound like that.
I know it will.

01:22:20.125 --> 01:22:22.719
If we need to have
three different drum sounds,

01:22:22.761 --> 01:22:25.855
wouldn't it be cool to have them
crossfade into each other,

01:22:25.897 --> 01:22:28.422
like as the other drum sound's
starting to come up

01:22:28.467 --> 01:22:30.435
and the other one's going back?

01:22:30.469 --> 01:22:33.802
Wouldn't it be cool
if we had a bucket of KFC right now?

01:22:35.741 --> 01:22:38.574
So in recording,
it usually begins with Taylor and I.

01:22:38.610 --> 01:22:41.306
The drums first, with the guitar,

01:22:41.346 --> 01:22:46.306
and at first it's really to see
if Taylor and I

01:22:46.351 --> 01:22:48.444
lock in with each other.

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:03.126
Did I miss my cue?

01:23:03.168 --> 01:23:04.362
Yes, you did.

01:23:04.403 --> 01:23:08.464
I go through a process,
sort of a self-loathing, "I suck" process

01:23:08.507 --> 01:23:09.872
when I'm recording drums.

01:23:09.908 --> 01:23:12.934
I tend to think
I'm the worst drummer in the world.

01:23:13.812 --> 01:23:15.541
Fuck.

01:23:15.580 --> 01:23:18.447
Sorry. I messed up the pattern a little bit.

01:23:18.483 --> 01:23:19.507
OK.

01:23:21.486 --> 01:23:24.148
When I go back and listen to the recording,

01:23:24.189 --> 01:23:26.919
I'm like, "I'm all over the place."
It's not great.

01:23:28.427 --> 01:23:30.361
Why? Why, God, why?

01:23:30.395 --> 01:23:32.920
Sorry, I broke a drumstick!

01:23:32.964 --> 01:23:36.832
Then it slowly evolves
and comes together after a couple hours,

01:23:36.868 --> 01:23:39.098
and I have a drum track I'm really proud of.

01:23:48.747 --> 01:23:50.738
The drums are finished.

01:23:52.651 --> 01:23:55.814
I'm still not sure about These Days.
I could sit there and agonize all day

01:23:55.854 --> 01:23:59.881
over one little snare hit or fuckin'...
the way a groove feels.

01:23:59.925 --> 01:24:01.722
- And you will.
- And I will.

01:24:01.760 --> 01:24:05.753
They'll play it on the radio and you'll go,
"Damn! That fuckin' snare hit!"

01:24:05.797 --> 01:24:09.130
Maybe we should have just ProTooled
the fuck out of this record.

01:24:09.167 --> 01:24:11.533
At least you know it's perfect.

01:24:43.902 --> 01:24:47.360
When you're recording analogue like this,
knowing it can't be fixed

01:24:47.405 --> 01:24:51.865
brings a factor to the way the band thinks
about how they're gonna play.

01:24:51.910 --> 01:24:55.368
For instance, Nate,
before he would do his bass part,

01:24:55.413 --> 01:24:57.472
would go out in the tent
and work out his part,

01:24:57.516 --> 01:25:01.247
so when he came in to play,
he knew everything he was gonna do.

01:25:32.617 --> 01:25:33.675
I think it sounds great.

01:25:33.718 --> 01:25:34.707
It sounds awesome.

01:25:34.753 --> 01:25:35.811
Yeah, it sounds awesome.

01:26:11.089 --> 01:26:13.284
Is the bass or anything doing...

01:26:14.693 --> 01:26:17.594
Is the bass or anything doing
a note coming out of...

01:26:19.464 --> 01:26:23.491
Is there anything like that?
Is that gonna, do you want one?

01:26:29.975 --> 01:26:31.943
- You know what I mean?
- I'd maybe not do that.

01:26:31.977 --> 01:26:33.205
Don't do that.

01:26:35.413 --> 01:26:39.213
That was very non-confrontational.
"Maybe don't do that."

01:26:39.251 --> 01:26:41.879
I would maybe not ever do that in the song.

01:26:41.920 --> 01:26:44.582
I'm the guy that plays the rhythm
straight up the middle.

01:26:44.623 --> 01:26:46.420
And then you have Chris,

01:26:46.491 --> 01:26:50.791
and Chris has a really sharp and clean sense
of melodic playing.

01:26:52.097 --> 01:26:53.496
Then over here, there's Pat.

01:26:53.531 --> 01:26:56.500
And it's like...
when Pat puts on a guitar it just goes...

01:27:07.579 --> 01:27:11.106
All of those things... If they're balanced
it sounds like the Foo Fighters.

01:27:11.149 --> 01:27:13.140
Did we finally get too grungy?

01:27:13.184 --> 01:27:18.247
It's never too grungy! I wonder if it's just,
you're losing, like, the notes.

01:27:31.569 --> 01:27:35.232
We've had this expanded band now
for the last couple albums.

01:27:49.287 --> 01:27:52.552
As a musician, it's a dream to be able to play
with as many people

01:27:52.590 --> 01:27:54.581
and do as many different things as you can.

01:27:55.593 --> 01:27:58.460
So where should we start?
What do you wanna start with?

01:27:58.496 --> 01:28:01.226
We gotta get Bob fuckin' rockin' and rollin'.

01:28:01.266 --> 01:28:02.597
What am I doing here?

01:28:02.634 --> 01:28:06.627
I just learned the song, I got it in my head.
What do you want me to do?

01:28:09.007 --> 01:28:14.274
When you meet someone that really helped
you become the musician that you are,

01:28:14.312 --> 01:28:17.110
I really think it's important
to acknowledge that.

01:28:30.995 --> 01:28:33.657
Bob's voice is so signature,

01:28:33.698 --> 01:28:35.962
and to have him come to my fuckin' house

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:39.959
and do it on my fuckin' record
blows me away.

01:28:40.004 --> 01:28:42.734
All right, cool.
You wanna do the bridge?

01:28:42.774 --> 01:28:44.207
What do you wanna do, Bob?

01:28:44.242 --> 01:28:45.709
Come on in.

01:28:45.744 --> 01:28:48.235
I didn't write the middle section of the song,

01:28:48.279 --> 01:28:52.375
because I wanted to write it with Bob,
while Bob was there.

01:28:56.921 --> 01:29:00.118
But I didn't have the words,
so I sort of explained it,

01:29:00.158 --> 01:29:03.355
and we tried it once just with phonetic crap.

01:29:15.940 --> 01:29:17.237
Is that gonna make sense?

01:29:17.275 --> 01:29:18.367
I think so.

01:29:19.377 --> 01:29:21.675
OK, let me write something really quick.

01:29:22.747 --> 01:29:24.874
OK, five-minute lyrics.

01:29:24.916 --> 01:29:27.180
OK, give me a five-minute lyric break.

01:29:27.218 --> 01:29:28.242
Clock's runnin'.

01:29:35.193 --> 01:29:36.251
Dad?

01:29:36.294 --> 01:29:37.352
Yeah?

01:29:37.395 --> 01:29:39.295
Remember you said you'll swim?

01:29:39.330 --> 01:29:42.891
I know, I have to write these words
really quick, so I can go sing it.

01:29:42.934 --> 01:29:44.094
OK.

01:29:47.372 --> 01:29:48.669
OK.

01:29:52.977 --> 01:29:55.104
One, two, you know what to do...

01:30:25.510 --> 01:30:26.636
That sounds so good!

01:30:26.678 --> 01:30:31.945
That is so fucking cool, you guys!
You can hear, it's really good.

01:30:31.983 --> 01:30:34.315
Some of the songs
still had question marks, you know,

01:30:34.352 --> 01:30:37.253
the biggest song being
I Should Have Known.

01:30:37.322 --> 01:30:39.847
That song became sort of the X factor
in the album.

01:31:02.013 --> 01:31:03.207
Yep, that's cool.

01:31:03.248 --> 01:31:04.442
Fuckin' A, right?

01:31:50.995 --> 01:31:53.122
I kinda feel like I Should Have Known

01:31:53.164 --> 01:31:58.124
is a song that's about Dave's past,

01:31:58.169 --> 01:32:02.333
and I think there are definitely references
in there about Nirvana and Kurt.

01:32:03.341 --> 01:32:05.309
Fuckin' A, man.

01:32:05.343 --> 01:32:07.106
That's really good.

01:32:07.145 --> 01:32:08.806
When I first started writing that song,

01:32:08.846 --> 01:32:12.247
it was about someone else
that I was involved with,

01:32:12.283 --> 01:32:14.410
and at the end of the day,
I said to myself,

01:32:14.452 --> 01:32:17.683
"I should have known
that this was gonna happen."

01:32:21.492 --> 01:32:22.618
But when I sing that song,

01:32:22.660 --> 01:32:27.290
it's hard not to think about
all of the times in my life that's happened.

01:32:36.674 --> 01:32:37.766
Hey, Krist!

01:32:37.842 --> 01:32:39.104
Hello!

01:32:40.311 --> 01:32:42.836
We had Krist Novoselic come in and play bass
on I Should Have Known.

01:32:42.880 --> 01:32:44.780
That was a very special moment,

01:32:44.816 --> 01:32:47.341
'cause I had not been in the same room
with Dave and Krist

01:32:47.385 --> 01:32:49.182
since we finished Nevermind.

01:32:57.061 --> 01:32:59.723
It does that back and forth twice,
then it does the turnaround chords.

01:32:59.764 --> 01:33:03.791
Yeah, it goes, D sharp,
G, D sharp, G, F, C,

01:33:03.868 --> 01:33:06.860
then it goes back in D sharp,
G, D sharp...

01:33:06.904 --> 01:33:08.735
It's like a six chord.

01:33:08.773 --> 01:33:10.104
So it goes...

01:33:25.423 --> 01:33:26.447
How was the tone?

01:33:26.491 --> 01:33:28.459
I think it fuckin' sounds gnarly.

01:33:28.493 --> 01:33:31.326
There, it's done. Seriously.

01:33:31.362 --> 01:33:32.829
That's all you get, motherfucker.

01:33:32.864 --> 01:33:36.356
I was not surprised that Dave asked Krist
to play on the record.

01:33:36.401 --> 01:33:41.566
I was surprised it hadn't happened
any other time in the last 16 years.

01:33:41.606 --> 01:33:46.009
You never realize how important
the bass sound is to the sound of a band

01:33:46.044 --> 01:33:49.480
until you put it in another band and go,
"Oh, there it is."

01:34:06.030 --> 01:34:08.021
I think what Krist played on the song

01:34:08.066 --> 01:34:12.469
was the absolute perfect thing for him to do
on a Foo Fighters record.

01:34:27.051 --> 01:34:29.884
I think that might be the ending.
We've found it.

01:34:31.622 --> 01:34:32.748
Yeah, sample my phone.

01:34:32.790 --> 01:34:34.451
The ice cream truck.

01:34:38.963 --> 01:34:41.955
It usually takes us a while to name an album.

01:34:43.401 --> 01:34:45.995
But I decided to call the record
Wasting Light,

01:34:46.037 --> 01:34:48.267
because I honestly feel like

01:34:48.306 --> 01:34:53.107
I don't wanna let one minute of this go
without really feeling it.

01:35:23.474 --> 01:35:27.308
The best way to prepare to playing
to 85,OOO people

01:35:27.345 --> 01:35:29.472
is to play at these small club gigs.

01:35:29.514 --> 01:35:33.245
Because that's kind of a true test.
You go to see an arena rock band.

01:35:33.284 --> 01:35:36.310
They're pretty good,
but would they be any good at the Roxy?

01:35:51.736 --> 01:35:52.862
Hold the fuckin'...

01:35:52.904 --> 01:35:54.531
Then bask in the glory for a minute.

01:36:02.780 --> 01:36:08.650
Having Scream be the first band on the bill,
my heroes from my childhood,

01:36:08.686 --> 01:36:11.746
the band that
I dropped out of high school to join,

01:36:11.789 --> 01:36:14.952
to see them sharing the stage
with my band Foo Fighters

01:36:14.992 --> 01:36:17.790
was a really big deal to me.

01:36:24.702 --> 01:36:26.135
Yeah, good night, y'all.

01:36:26.170 --> 01:36:28.001
Thank you.

01:36:47.825 --> 01:36:49.918
You guys wanna hear the new record?

01:36:58.102 --> 01:37:00.161
The Foo Fighters
sound like the Foo Fighters

01:37:00.204 --> 01:37:04.368
because it's me, and Taylor, and Nate,
and Chris, and Pat.

01:37:04.408 --> 01:37:07.275
If it were anyone else, it would sound different.

01:37:07.311 --> 01:37:09.836
You never wanna lose anybody,

01:37:09.881 --> 01:37:14.045
and you never wanna see someone
disappear out of your life,

01:37:14.118 --> 01:37:17.610
but we wouldn't be here
if it were different with William.

01:37:17.655 --> 01:37:20.351
We wouldn't be here
if it were different with Franz.

01:37:20.391 --> 01:37:24.293
I feel bad about the bad things,
I feel good about the good things,

01:37:24.328 --> 01:37:26.455
but I wouldn't change a thing.

01:38:02.233 --> 01:38:04.394
We've worked hard,
and we've made a great band.

01:38:04.435 --> 01:38:06.767
I'm incapable of doing
almost anything else

01:38:06.804 --> 01:38:08.965
at this point in time,
so this is what I do.

01:38:09.006 --> 01:38:12.874
I'm an adult that plays in a rock band.
How about that?

01:38:24.055 --> 01:38:26.148
I've had people say in interviews,

01:38:26.190 --> 01:38:29.216
"So, Taylor,
what is it like to be a rock star?"

01:38:29.260 --> 01:38:32.457
And I'm like, "Fuck you.
I'm not a rock star. I'm a musician."

01:38:53.351 --> 01:38:55.649
It's a functional family,
you know what I mean?

01:38:55.686 --> 01:38:58.655
I go to work coming up here,

01:38:58.689 --> 01:39:01.157
and I just fucking laugh all day
and play great music.

01:39:25.182 --> 01:39:27.980
There will probably always, to some extent,
be that feeling,

01:39:28.019 --> 01:39:31.352
"This could all end tomorrow.
Who the fuck knows, you know?"

01:39:31.389 --> 01:39:33.323
We're all pretty lucky that we get to do this

01:39:33.357 --> 01:39:36.224
and we have to enjoy it while it's here
and make the most of it.

01:39:53.244 --> 01:39:59.342
It's a crazy feeling when something goes
from a spark of imagination

01:39:59.383 --> 01:40:01.851
to something you can hold in your hands.

01:40:01.886 --> 01:40:03.820
That first cassette...

01:40:05.089 --> 01:40:08.354
made in five fuckin' days or whatever,

01:40:08.392 --> 01:40:14.126
and here we are. It's just like,
"Whoa. How the fuck did this happen?"

01:40:48.532 --> 01:40:50.625
Honestly, had I taken
this whole career thing seriously,

01:40:50.668 --> 01:40:51.999
I would've named it something else,

01:40:52.036 --> 01:40:54.300
'cause it's the worst fuckin' band name
in the world!
