WEBVTT

00:07.383 --> 00:08.759
She has babies.

00:08.759 --> 00:10.511
Please, help her. Please.

00:10.511 --> 00:12.513
Baby, I'm sorry. She's gone.

00:13.889 --> 00:16.600
No. Hey. You can't have that.
That's not for you.

00:16.600 --> 00:18.728
You heard of any ships
going missing at the ring?

00:18.728 --> 00:21.105
There was some Martian intel
about a number of ships

00:21.105 --> 00:22.982
that went dark while passing
through the rings.

00:22.982 --> 00:24.483
Can you get me a look
at that intel?

00:24.483 --> 00:25.568
I'll make it happen.

00:25.568 --> 00:27.987
I want to commission
a project from you.

00:27.987 --> 00:30.448
I want the Belt to see
what it's doing to us

00:30.448 --> 00:32.450
and make it just
a little harder

00:32.450 --> 00:35.703
for them to feel good
about killing Earthers.

00:35.703 --> 00:37.121
The Azure Dragon,

00:37.121 --> 00:38.831
a spotter ship
that's been guiding the rocks.

00:38.831 --> 00:40.541
And we're gonna capture it?

00:40.541 --> 00:42.168
Naomi? Where are you?

00:47.214 --> 00:48.591
We're in.

00:48.591 --> 00:50.009
You should have access
to whatever's there.

00:50.718 --> 00:52.052
Motherlode.

00:52.052 --> 00:53.554
If they got
the data core intact,

00:53.554 --> 00:55.181
they'll be able
to locate the rocks

00:55.181 --> 00:56.432
that are still in flight.

00:56.432 --> 00:58.309
And all the rest
that are ready to launch.

00:58.309 --> 01:01.520
And the moment that happens,
they'll redeploy their fleets.

01:01.520 --> 01:05.024
Let them come.
We'll be ready.

01:23.501 --> 01:25.336
We all come
from different places

01:25.336 --> 01:26.712
and for different reasons.

01:26.712 --> 01:29.381
Annie's family came from L-4
with the survey group.

01:29.381 --> 01:31.175
I came from Mars
with the fleet.

01:31.175 --> 01:33.969
But no matter where we come
from or how we got here,

01:33.969 --> 01:36.305
we're all Laconians now.

01:38.849 --> 01:40.267
And since everyone
on the survey group

01:40.267 --> 01:41.519
has been here longer,

01:41.519 --> 01:43.187
you can help people like me
who came later

01:43.187 --> 01:44.396
by telling us about anything

01:44.396 --> 01:46.440
that seems different
or changed,

01:46.440 --> 01:48.234
especially in the last few weeks.

01:50.194 --> 01:52.112
And also by paying attention
in class.

01:58.077 --> 02:00.120
Class dismissed.

02:05.376 --> 02:07.336
Cara! We're gonna play soccer.

02:07.336 --> 02:08.420
You can be on our team.

02:08.420 --> 02:10.214
No, I can't.
I'll be home for dinner.

02:10.214 --> 02:13.342
- Well, can I go with you?
- No.

02:13.342 --> 02:15.386
I told you, stop following me.

02:16.637 --> 02:17.930
Come on, let's go.

02:52.381 --> 02:53.883
It's fixed.

03:31.629 --> 03:33.839
You fixed her.

03:34.882 --> 03:36.091
You fixed her!

03:36.091 --> 03:37.343
You fix things!

03:49.313 --> 03:50.439
Mom, Dad,

03:50.439 --> 03:52.149
you'll never believe
what happened...

04:32.731 --> 04:35.567
Attention, all
inhabitants of Ceres Station.

04:35.567 --> 04:37.861
This is the Joint Fleet
of the United Nations

04:37.861 --> 04:39.029
of Earth and Luna

04:39.029 --> 04:41.615
and the Mars
Congressional Republic.

04:41.615 --> 04:44.243
We demand the immediate
and unconditional surrender

04:44.243 --> 04:46.620
of all Free Navy forces.

04:47.204 --> 04:49.873
No response from
Ceres Station on any band.

04:49.873 --> 04:51.291
Sector three is clear.

04:51.291 --> 04:52.668
No sign of Free Navy gunships

04:52.668 --> 04:54.503
or any Belter ships
in the vicinity.

04:54.503 --> 04:56.380
It looks abandoned.

04:56.380 --> 04:59.675
Marco Inaros abandon Ceres?
Hard to believe.

05:00.217 --> 05:02.302
This feels like a trap.

05:46.597 --> 05:48.140
Inner dock clear.

05:48.140 --> 05:49.933
No I.R., no heartbeats.

06:09.745 --> 06:11.914
Seeing lots
of gear stripped out.

06:11.914 --> 06:14.708
All Marines,
heat signatures on level 12.

06:16.251 --> 06:18.087
Everyone get down!

06:18.087 --> 06:20.631
No sudden moves.
Everyone get down!

06:26.011 --> 06:28.555
I'm the Chief Administrator
of this station.

06:28.555 --> 06:30.349
I'll talk to someone
who matters.

06:35.437 --> 06:38.273
- Lose the restraints.
- Sergeant.

06:50.911 --> 06:52.246
Do you know who I am?

06:52.246 --> 06:54.039
Is there a Belter
who doesn't?

06:54.039 --> 06:56.959
You worked for Anderson Dawes.

06:56.959 --> 06:59.336
He was a reasonable man.

06:59.336 --> 07:02.089
More comfortable with violence
than I would have liked.

07:02.089 --> 07:04.508
But with a keen eye
for the possible.

07:04.508 --> 07:07.469
Dawes had a vision.
I shared it.

07:07.469 --> 07:10.848
Then why are you working for
the man who assassinated him?

07:10.848 --> 07:13.350
I work for the Belt.

07:13.350 --> 07:17.062
Where is Marco Inaros?

07:17.062 --> 07:19.273
He didn't tell me
where he was going or why.

07:19.273 --> 07:20.440
And I didn't ask.

07:20.440 --> 07:24.611
He knows the strategic value
of this port.

07:24.611 --> 07:26.697
He would not have let us
take control

07:26.697 --> 07:30.659
of the seat of his government,
disrupt his supply lines,

07:30.659 --> 07:33.245
and establish
a forward position in the Belt

07:33.245 --> 07:35.998
with no resistance whatsoever.

07:35.998 --> 07:39.084
You will encounter
no resistance on this station.

07:39.084 --> 07:41.003
If I were part of
an insurgency,

07:41.003 --> 07:43.297
would I have just
given myself up as I did?

07:43.297 --> 07:45.465
That would be a clever ploy.

07:45.465 --> 07:47.176
Maybe your kind of clever.

07:47.176 --> 07:49.052
If you want my advice,
here it is.

07:49.052 --> 07:50.345
Take your people and leave.

07:50.345 --> 07:51.513
Watch your fucking mouth.

07:51.513 --> 07:52.639
Sergeant.

07:57.936 --> 08:00.063
Inaros abandoned you.

08:00.063 --> 08:03.275
I chose to remain here
to limit the damage

08:03.275 --> 08:05.777
your illegitimate occupation
will do.

08:06.570 --> 08:08.614
Everything that could
be of use to your troops

08:08.614 --> 08:09.740
has been stripped.

08:09.740 --> 08:13.118
Ceres has no warships,
no munitions,

08:13.118 --> 08:17.831
no functioning repair skiffs,
no surplus fuel or rations.

08:17.831 --> 08:19.708
And at our current rate
of consumption,

08:19.708 --> 08:23.795
only enough food and air
for approximately three weeks.

08:28.091 --> 08:31.511
Is that clever enough for you?

08:31.511 --> 08:33.889
I suppose we'll find out.

08:38.393 --> 08:39.436
Madam, if I may.

08:40.562 --> 08:42.314
We have several trained
interrogators in our fleet

08:42.314 --> 08:43.649
who'd be delighted
to squeeze out

08:43.649 --> 08:46.777
every scrap of intel
that Belter's holding back.

08:46.777 --> 08:50.197
MCRN Command
is going to insist.

08:50.197 --> 08:51.740
Fine.

08:51.740 --> 08:55.369
But Sanjrani is not
to be removed from the Station.

08:55.369 --> 08:58.705
And I expect a UN
representative to be present

08:58.705 --> 09:00.082
for any interviews.

09:00.082 --> 09:01.792
No coercive methods.

09:02.584 --> 09:05.754
We don't use coercion, ma'am.
We don't need to.

09:13.387 --> 09:14.763
Release the prisoner.

09:14.763 --> 09:18.976
Keep them and any direct
contacts under surveillance.

09:18.976 --> 09:21.603
No one is to be taken in
for questioning

09:21.603 --> 09:23.272
without my authorization.

09:23.272 --> 09:24.731
The last thing we need

09:24.731 --> 09:27.484
is to be seen rounding up
Belters like cattle.

09:28.318 --> 09:29.611
Yes, ma'am.

09:33.907 --> 09:37.494
There's no way we can feed
and supply a million people

09:37.494 --> 09:39.579
on three weeks' notice.

09:39.579 --> 09:40.956
Our lines are already
overstretched.

09:40.956 --> 09:43.292
That's the whole
fucking point, isn't it?

09:43.292 --> 09:46.586
Inaros knew we needed this port
to repair and refuel

09:46.586 --> 09:48.588
and stage for Jupiter
and Saturn,

09:48.588 --> 09:50.966
and he turned it into a trap.

09:52.634 --> 09:54.553
And we're in it now.

09:54.553 --> 09:57.097
If he were in this position,
he wouldn't lift a finger

09:57.097 --> 09:58.682
to keep our people alive.

09:58.682 --> 09:59.683
This is his mess.

09:59.683 --> 10:01.476
And he made it ours.

10:01.476 --> 10:03.687
If we don't help this station,

10:03.687 --> 10:05.772
we will be the ones responsible

10:05.772 --> 10:08.442
for a massive
humanitarian crisis.

10:08.442 --> 10:11.611
The Belt will see us once again
as the oppressor,

10:11.611 --> 10:16.283
and Inaros' power
will continue to grow.

11:51.920 --> 11:55.424
Looks like clear sailing
all the way to Ceres.

11:56.466 --> 11:57.634
You have the watch.

11:57.634 --> 11:59.511
Wait...what?

11:59.511 --> 12:01.096
I really need
to get some sleep.

12:01.096 --> 12:02.806
I'm starting to drift off
in the chair.

12:02.806 --> 12:05.016
So as of now,
you're in the rotation.

12:05.767 --> 12:07.144
You know I wasn't
in the Navy.

12:07.144 --> 12:10.272
And I was only in it
long enough to get thrown out.

12:10.272 --> 12:11.731
All you gotta do is stay awake

12:11.731 --> 12:13.608
and keep an eye on things
in case of emergency.

12:14.484 --> 12:15.861
I can hold my own on a shuttle,

12:15.861 --> 12:18.655
but I'm not rated
to fly a ship like this.

12:18.655 --> 12:20.490
It's just point A
to point B from here.

12:20.490 --> 12:22.284
The Roci does that fine
on her own.

12:24.494 --> 12:25.996
In that case...

12:27.998 --> 12:31.042
-
- Are you all right?

12:31.042 --> 12:32.627
Mm. Yeah.
I'm fine.

12:32.627 --> 12:34.671
It's been a while
since I used my mods.

12:36.131 --> 12:38.884
It's taking longer to flush out
of my system than it used to.

12:39.885 --> 12:41.845
I'm fine. Really.

12:41.845 --> 12:43.096
Okay.

12:43.096 --> 12:44.681
Hopefully you won't
have to use those mods again

12:44.681 --> 12:45.974
anytime soon.

12:45.974 --> 12:47.767
I got them because of you.

12:53.857 --> 12:57.319
At first,
I just wanted to kill you.

12:57.986 --> 13:00.238
Then I thought it'd be better
to disgrace you.

13:00.238 --> 13:03.658
To make my father
look like a hero, I guess.

13:03.658 --> 13:05.410
Which I know he's not.

13:05.410 --> 13:07.120
I'm not blaming you.

13:07.120 --> 13:09.789
I did it to myself.
I take responsibility for that.

13:13.877 --> 13:16.922
I used my mods to kill a man.

13:17.923 --> 13:19.549
With my bare hands.

13:21.343 --> 13:23.345
His name was Ren.

13:23.345 --> 13:25.889
He was a nice man.

13:25.889 --> 13:28.016
He had a family.

13:28.016 --> 13:32.604
He trained me, stood up for me,
and was nothing but good to me.

13:35.815 --> 13:39.694
Every time I use my mods,
I see his face.

13:40.695 --> 13:43.615
Surprised,

13:43.615 --> 13:45.909
and then scared,

13:45.909 --> 13:47.744
and then in so much pain.

13:49.454 --> 13:50.789
And then nothing.

13:54.960 --> 13:58.004
I think that's the real reason
I always throw up afterwards.

14:00.715 --> 14:03.468
Everybody on this ship
has something they regret.

14:04.886 --> 14:07.556
Including Amos, I think.

14:09.849 --> 14:12.018
You're in good company.

14:14.479 --> 14:16.189
I have the watch.

14:30.370 --> 14:32.872
Do you believe that prick
Inaros just cut and run?

14:34.291 --> 14:37.085
- I didn't see any white flags.
- Me neither.

14:37.711 --> 14:38.878
What have you got there?

14:42.215 --> 14:44.092
Package claimed it was food.

14:47.596 --> 14:49.055
You know, I think that
Supply Sergeant gave us

14:49.055 --> 14:50.265
the bottom of the barrel.

14:53.476 --> 14:55.145
Mm...yeah.

14:55.145 --> 14:56.605
I think
you might be right.

14:57.772 --> 14:58.773
Can you cook?

15:00.275 --> 15:02.611
I can reheat a leftover,
but that's about it.

15:04.904 --> 15:07.782
They got some good
noodle shops on Ceres.

15:08.700 --> 15:09.576
You've spent time there?

15:09.576 --> 15:10.577
Oh, yeah.

15:10.577 --> 15:11.995
When I was on the Cant,

15:11.995 --> 15:14.581
the run was pretty much
Saturn to Ceres and back.

15:14.581 --> 15:15.665
The Canterbury.

15:15.665 --> 15:17.083
I haven't thought
about that in a while.

15:19.169 --> 15:20.211
Me neither.

15:21.087 --> 15:22.255
When the Donnie got killed,

15:22.255 --> 15:23.923
most Martians blamed you
and yours for it.

15:24.716 --> 15:26.343
Was a time I would have
jumped at the chance

15:26.343 --> 15:27.844
to haul you all back
to Hecate Base

15:27.844 --> 15:30.055
and have you
vigorously debriefed.

15:31.431 --> 15:33.308
I wouldn't have gone quietly.

15:33.308 --> 15:35.226
That would have been fun too.

15:39.064 --> 15:41.775
That aftertaste sneaks up
on you, don't it?

15:41.775 --> 15:43.360
Uh-huh.

15:46.071 --> 15:47.489
What else is good on Ceres?

15:47.489 --> 15:49.115
They got decent booze.

15:49.115 --> 15:51.242
And all the brothels are union.

15:54.287 --> 15:57.374
Anything other than noodles,
bars, and brothels?

15:59.459 --> 16:01.294
I never looked.

16:04.339 --> 16:05.882
The Free Navy is in retreat.

16:05.882 --> 16:08.843
No lives were lost, and a major
port is back in our control.

16:08.843 --> 16:10.845
How can you construe that
as anything other than a win?

16:10.845 --> 16:13.056
How much of
our own food will be redirected

16:13.056 --> 16:15.100
to start feeding
these terrorists,

16:15.100 --> 16:17.352
when our own citizens
are in dire need?

16:18.853 --> 16:21.564
Hi.
- Hey.

16:21.564 --> 16:22.816
How's it going?

16:24.526 --> 16:26.611
- Fine.
- Good.

16:26.611 --> 16:29.197
Fine is good.

16:31.866 --> 16:33.618
It's okay to talk about it.

16:33.618 --> 16:35.620
I didn't want to push.

16:37.414 --> 16:38.456
I froze up.

16:41.167 --> 16:43.044
It came time
to go out the door,

16:43.044 --> 16:45.672
and for a few seconds,

16:45.672 --> 16:51.678
I was back on the Pella
in the air lock without a suit.

16:53.722 --> 16:57.225
And I was jumping off
the Chetzemoka

16:57.225 --> 16:58.768
without an air bottle.

17:01.604 --> 17:04.232
My body just wouldn't move.

17:07.026 --> 17:09.696
A few more seconds, and I
would have pulled it together.

17:11.156 --> 17:12.949
But by then, Clarissa had...

17:14.617 --> 17:16.953
It's fucking humiliating.

17:16.953 --> 17:18.705
If I'd been through all
the things you did,

17:18.705 --> 17:20.999
would you be
embarrassed for me?

17:20.999 --> 17:21.833
No.

17:23.334 --> 17:24.794
You'd be doing that
for yourself.

17:26.421 --> 17:27.255
True.

17:32.010 --> 17:33.219
Can I ask you a favor?

17:33.219 --> 17:36.347
Of course. What?

17:36.347 --> 17:39.726
- The Barkeith.
- Is that a ship?

17:39.726 --> 17:42.145
Yeah.
One of the rogue Martians.

17:43.313 --> 17:44.272
It might have been involved

17:44.272 --> 17:45.690
with Fred's
stolen Protomolecule.

17:47.150 --> 17:49.319
I came across some UNN
surveillance video

17:49.319 --> 17:50.862
of the Barkeith
leaving the Ring Space.

17:50.862 --> 17:52.197
And I asked Bobby if the UN

17:52.197 --> 17:54.657
had any record
of similar incidents of ships

17:54.657 --> 17:56.409
that went missing after
Ring transits,

17:56.409 --> 17:58.828
and she came through,
but there's a ton of data.

17:58.828 --> 18:01.080
I could really use some help
making sense of it.

18:04.209 --> 18:05.502
You're trying to distract me

18:05.502 --> 18:07.879
by giving me
an interesting problem.

18:09.297 --> 18:10.590
- Yes.
-

18:15.345 --> 18:16.763
Show me what you got.

18:30.235 --> 18:33.154
There was unrest on
several stations in the Belt,

18:33.154 --> 18:35.365
as some expressed anger
over what they believe

18:35.365 --> 18:37.575
was abandonment
of Ceres Station.

18:37.575 --> 18:41.120
On Ganymede, an agri-genetics
researcher was shot and killed

18:41.120 --> 18:42.288
when she attempted to flee

18:42.288 --> 18:44.374
during a routine
security check.

18:44.374 --> 18:47.544
It is believed the researcher
was a spy for the Inners.

18:47.544 --> 18:51.172
On Vesta, Inaros partisans
clashed with protestors,

18:51.172 --> 18:52.423
leaving several injured,

18:52.423 --> 18:55.009
including one
Free Navy mechanic dead.

19:04.894 --> 19:05.728
Report.

19:06.688 --> 19:08.231
Lauber and Granicus
have re-altered

19:08.231 --> 19:10.316
drive signatures as ordered.

19:10.316 --> 19:13.528
All ships maintain
radio silence, no new contacts.

19:13.528 --> 19:14.362
Good.

19:15.530 --> 19:16.865
Did you have a chance

19:16.865 --> 19:19.075
to look over my assessment
of the Inners' fleet?

19:19.075 --> 19:23.121
- I did.
- You don't seem concerned.

19:23.121 --> 19:24.831
Can't say that I am.

19:24.831 --> 19:28.835
Three new UNN capital ships
and two Martian Donnager class.

19:28.835 --> 19:30.295
That's more
than we expected.

19:30.295 --> 19:33.256
They will rebuild
their forces quickly.

19:33.256 --> 19:34.173
They will need them.

19:35.258 --> 19:37.218
This is nothing
to be happy about.

19:37.218 --> 19:39.137
Why should I be sad?

19:39.137 --> 19:40.680
We will overcome it.

19:43.558 --> 19:46.060
The routes our ships
are going to have to take

19:46.060 --> 19:47.687
to collect supplies for Medina

19:47.687 --> 19:49.898
will put a number of them
in close proximity

19:49.898 --> 19:52.150
to several Inner battle groups.

19:52.150 --> 19:54.527
We won't be able to avoid
engaging all of them.

19:54.527 --> 19:56.696
This is not the Inners'
kind of fight.

19:56.696 --> 20:00.241
We will hit and run
and hit and run and be gone

20:00.241 --> 20:02.327
before they know what hit them.

20:03.870 --> 20:06.122
Father.

20:06.122 --> 20:07.999
May I have a word, please?

20:15.089 --> 20:16.215
What's on your mind?

20:16.215 --> 20:18.009
They're calling us cowards.

20:18.009 --> 20:21.971
- Who exactly are "they"?
- Dissidents. On the news.

20:21.971 --> 20:26.935
Why do you care
what a dissident thinks?

20:26.935 --> 20:29.979
You told the people on Ceres
that it was our new capital,

20:29.979 --> 20:33.024
that we will make it
the pride of the Belt.

20:33.024 --> 20:35.276
- And you feel that...
- We abandoned them.

20:35.276 --> 20:37.320
Or was that always
part of your plan?

20:37.320 --> 20:40.365
We could never hold Ceres
against the Inners.

20:40.365 --> 20:43.159
But the people there needed
to believe that we could.

20:43.159 --> 20:45.828
So I told the people
what they needed to hear

20:45.828 --> 20:47.121
when they needed to hear it.

20:47.121 --> 20:49.123
We stripped the station,

20:49.123 --> 20:50.333
left them barely enough
to survive...

20:50.333 --> 20:51.876
We left the Inners
with a problem

20:51.876 --> 20:53.503
that they had to deal with.

20:53.503 --> 20:55.505
Tied up their resources
and weakened them.

21:10.770 --> 21:13.773
It speaks well of you
that you care about them...

21:15.274 --> 21:17.819
...but the Belters on Ceres
are not like us.

21:19.737 --> 21:21.656
Generation after generation,

21:21.656 --> 21:23.324
they've slaved away
for the Inners,

21:23.324 --> 21:27.328
accommodating their needs
instead of fighting for ours.

21:27.328 --> 21:29.288
Caring more
for their own comforts

21:29.288 --> 21:31.082
than the future of the Belt.

21:31.749 --> 21:36.629
You and I, we're meant
to be out here in the darkness.

21:42.844 --> 21:44.929
In the fight.

21:44.929 --> 21:47.932
That's who we are.

21:47.932 --> 21:50.601
Who we were born to be.

21:50.601 --> 21:54.397
Never forget what your name is.

21:55.565 --> 21:57.775
The name we share.

22:27.013 --> 22:29.432
So these
colleagues of yours...

22:29.432 --> 22:31.809
The Galt
has three shotgun PDCs

22:31.809 --> 22:33.144
and one missile rack.

22:33.144 --> 22:35.813
The Saberhagen is all missiles,

22:35.813 --> 22:37.065
but they carry a good load-out.

22:37.065 --> 22:39.108
- And you trust them fully?
- Fully?

22:39.108 --> 22:41.277
Well...more like enough.

22:41.903 --> 22:43.905
It was easier
in the beginning.

22:43.905 --> 22:46.491
When disaster first happens,

22:46.491 --> 22:48.993
we all pull together
to help each other.

22:48.993 --> 22:51.245
It's a natural human instinct.

22:51.245 --> 22:53.664
But when things
don't get better,

22:53.664 --> 22:58.544
when people stay hurt
and hungry and scared,

22:58.544 --> 23:03.174
remembering that feeling of
caring for each other is hard.

23:05.093 --> 23:06.594
But we have to.

23:06.594 --> 23:09.347
It is the only way
we will pull through this.

23:09.347 --> 23:10.807
All of us.

23:10.807 --> 23:12.391
No matter what part
of the system we're from.

23:12.391 --> 23:15.561
Ah, poor, poor Earther.

23:15.561 --> 23:17.355
Doesn't know where she'll
get her food and water.

23:19.065 --> 23:21.317
Welcome to the Belt.

23:21.317 --> 23:24.153
The supply depot
should be around here.

23:24.153 --> 23:25.780
Definitely in this orbit.

23:25.780 --> 23:27.532
- Definitely?
- More or less.

23:27.532 --> 23:29.492
I remember it pretty well.

23:29.492 --> 23:31.536
Took some doing
to spin it up right.

23:31.536 --> 23:33.538
You said Marco had
several of these caches.

23:33.538 --> 23:34.705
Yeah.

23:34.705 --> 23:36.749
Could be as many as ten,
from what I heard.

23:36.749 --> 23:37.625
For what purpose?

23:38.793 --> 23:42.588
The Free Navy controls most of
the major stations in the Belt.

23:42.588 --> 23:45.258
Why go to such trouble
to hide supplies like this?

23:45.258 --> 23:47.969
Maybe hedging his bet
for when the Inners would come.

23:47.969 --> 23:49.637
Which now they have.

23:49.637 --> 23:52.557
You tell me.
Strategy is for generals.

23:52.557 --> 23:54.267
I'm not sad to know
that some Earthers

23:54.267 --> 23:55.643
have to live the way
we always have.

23:55.643 --> 23:57.019
No one should
have to live the way we have.

23:57.019 --> 23:58.771
And maybe now
they'll understand that.

23:58.771 --> 23:59.772
Understand what?

23:59.772 --> 24:01.858
That the Belt
poisoned their water

24:01.858 --> 24:03.276
and starved them?

24:03.276 --> 24:06.154
That we killed their children
the way that they kill ours?

24:06.154 --> 24:07.029
What is the problem?

24:10.366 --> 24:12.535
Nothing.
Difference of opinion.

24:13.828 --> 24:16.622
Sorry, Captain.
We did not mean to disturb you.

24:20.626 --> 24:22.587
I see why you wanted
that one off your ship.

24:22.587 --> 24:23.796
Did I ask you?

24:25.173 --> 24:28.176
Bosmang, two contact, inbound.
Requesting tight-beam.

24:28.176 --> 24:29.260
On comms.

24:31.929 --> 24:33.389
This is Saberhagen,

24:33.389 --> 24:35.308
speaking also for the Galt.

24:35.308 --> 24:38.603
Captain Drummer,
we was Golden Bough.

24:38.603 --> 24:40.479
Now we fight with you.

24:40.479 --> 24:41.314
Good.

24:42.648 --> 24:44.275
I'm ready for a fight.

24:46.444 --> 24:48.905
We have green zones
around all of the main docks,

24:48.905 --> 24:50.698
including the refueling stations.

24:50.698 --> 24:52.867
The secondary ports
and the maintenance yards

24:52.867 --> 24:54.827
will be secured next.

24:54.827 --> 24:57.914
- How are the locals taking it?
- Poorly.

24:57.914 --> 25:00.791
But they seem
to be complying so far.

25:00.791 --> 25:04.420
Maybe Sanjrani wasn't
bullshitting us after all.

25:04.420 --> 25:07.465
I can't tell if you're being
sarcastic or not, ma'am.

25:07.465 --> 25:09.091
I was being sarcastic.

25:09.091 --> 25:12.678
...at all times.
We will depart in one minute.

25:12.678 --> 25:16.974
- Embedding?
- You bet I am. Ma'am.

25:16.974 --> 25:17.892
Good.

25:17.892 --> 25:19.769
By the way, I quite liked

25:19.769 --> 25:21.020
your last report.

25:21.020 --> 25:22.855
I figured that.
You approved it.

25:22.855 --> 25:25.691
The Pastor has a knack
for eliciting sympathy.

25:25.691 --> 25:27.902
- Mm-hmm.
-

25:27.902 --> 25:29.946
Well, my next piece
will be better.

25:36.494 --> 25:38.746
Tell your Marines to keep
a close eye on her.

25:38.746 --> 25:40.957
She has a knack
for causing trouble.

25:40.957 --> 25:41.832
Yes, ma'am.

25:56.305 --> 25:57.974
What is it?

25:57.974 --> 26:01.227
Captain, scopes pick up
one drive plume.

26:01.227 --> 26:02.979
Could be a Duster frigate.

26:02.979 --> 26:04.730
Any other ships
in the vicinity?

26:04.730 --> 26:06.691
Not seeing
any other plume near.

26:12.196 --> 26:14.865
Rocinante.

26:14.865 --> 26:17.868
They're headed for Ceres.

26:17.868 --> 26:20.454
To rejoin their Inners,
no doubt.

26:22.164 --> 26:23.291
They're alone.

26:24.750 --> 26:26.627
We can't be sure
what else is out there

26:26.627 --> 26:27.753
without active scans.

26:27.753 --> 26:29.422
And we can't give away
our position.

26:29.422 --> 26:31.966
They are nearly within
missile range.

26:31.966 --> 26:33.968
If we divert,
it will delay.

26:35.136 --> 26:37.430
It's just a frigate.

26:37.430 --> 26:39.140
They're no match for the Pella.

26:39.140 --> 26:41.684
Not even one-on-one,
and we are three-to-one.

26:41.684 --> 26:43.060
- They have a rail gun.
- Yeah.

26:43.060 --> 26:44.687
And by the time they're
close enough to use it,

26:44.687 --> 26:46.272
they will be dust.

26:46.272 --> 26:48.357
With Lauber and Granicus,

26:48.357 --> 26:52.278
our missile advantage
is five-to-one.

26:52.278 --> 26:54.113
You don't have to do this.

26:54.113 --> 26:55.489
It is not the right time.

26:55.489 --> 26:58.075
You should learn
to recognize an opportunity

26:58.075 --> 26:59.535
when one presents itself.

27:01.579 --> 27:03.164
Battle stations!

27:05.082 --> 27:06.417
Filip.

27:09.420 --> 27:11.422
Will you take the guns?

27:13.924 --> 27:15.134
Yes, Captain.

27:18.846 --> 27:20.473
Weapons to my son.

27:20.473 --> 27:21.557
Aye, Captain.

27:32.568 --> 27:34.403
I used metal epoxy
to fill the cracks

27:34.403 --> 27:36.489
so it wouldn't get any worse.

27:36.489 --> 27:39.158
But I can't say
how well it bonded.

27:39.158 --> 27:41.035
This alloy is tough as shit.

27:42.328 --> 27:44.163
What the hell is this armor
made out of anyway?

27:45.373 --> 27:47.792
It's made of Mars,
honey buns.

27:51.545 --> 27:52.755
What's up?

27:52.755 --> 27:54.965
I'm not sure.

27:54.965 --> 27:56.467
Someone sent me something.

27:57.385 --> 27:58.386
Could you be more vague?

28:06.102 --> 28:08.813
Looks like it was all routed
through anonymous relays.

28:08.813 --> 28:11.232
Somebody's trying hard
not to leave any tracks.

28:11.232 --> 28:13.818
Hmm.
- Amos.

28:13.818 --> 28:15.361
I hope this finds you well.

28:15.361 --> 28:16.654
Sorry, that was trite.

28:16.654 --> 28:18.906
- That's the plant guy.
- Prax.

28:18.906 --> 28:20.658
I know you're in
the middle of a war.

28:20.658 --> 28:24.286
The Free Navy shot a researcher
in my lab today.

28:24.286 --> 28:26.330
They said she was a spy.

28:26.330 --> 28:27.790
Her name was Karvonides.

28:27.790 --> 28:30.668
For the past year,
we were working on ways

28:30.668 --> 28:34.004
to improve crop yields
for food grown in the Belt.

28:34.004 --> 28:36.632
Karvonides was developing
a new strain of yeast

28:36.632 --> 28:38.551
with a robust
proofing polymerase

28:38.551 --> 28:40.177
modified with organelles

28:40.177 --> 28:42.847
that mimic the Protomolecule's
harvesting structures.

28:42.847 --> 28:45.307
It produces a complete
digestible protein

28:45.307 --> 28:48.727
with micronutrient uptake
comparable to unmodified soy.

28:48.727 --> 28:50.938
Give him a second.
He'll get around to it.

28:52.106 --> 28:53.899
That probably didn't make
any sense to you.

28:53.899 --> 28:56.652
This yeast could create
massive amounts of food

28:56.652 --> 28:59.155
out of a little more
than spare carbon dioxide

28:59.155 --> 29:00.781
and waste energy.

29:00.781 --> 29:02.366
You know people with power.

29:02.366 --> 29:05.202
Please get this data to them.

29:05.202 --> 29:07.705
I think that's what Karvonides
was trying to do.

29:08.873 --> 29:10.166
Earth could use it now.

29:10.166 --> 29:14.044
Don't worry about me or Mei
or the rest of us.

29:14.044 --> 29:15.838
I can take care of them.

29:16.922 --> 29:18.466
I miss you, my friend.

29:20.009 --> 29:21.552
I hope this helps.

29:24.305 --> 29:26.724
He's got a whole
new family now.

29:27.391 --> 29:28.809
There's nothing in this
for him.

29:30.686 --> 29:32.021
He's just a good guy.

29:32.730 --> 29:34.565
That's what it always takes.

29:35.733 --> 29:37.776
If Prax thinks it's
important, then it is.

29:39.361 --> 29:41.447
Chrissie'll know
what to do with it.

29:41.447 --> 29:43.824
The Old Lady really loves it
when you call her that.

29:44.825 --> 29:46.452
At least I say it to her face.

30:01.592 --> 30:03.552
Jim. Jim!

30:03.552 --> 30:04.512
I'm awake.

30:05.971 --> 30:07.139
I think
there's a pattern

30:07.139 --> 30:08.682
with these
ship disappearances.

30:11.185 --> 30:12.269
- You do?
- Mm.

30:14.271 --> 30:16.065
It's happened
to different kinds of ships

30:16.065 --> 30:17.441
and in different Rings.

30:17.441 --> 30:20.110
But the disappearances seem
to be happening in clusters,

30:20.110 --> 30:22.613
each roughly spanning
the same amount of time.

30:22.613 --> 30:25.157
It's like a hole
suddenly opens in the floor.

30:25.157 --> 30:27.701
And if someone falls in,
they're gone.

30:27.701 --> 30:29.161
But then a minute later,

30:29.161 --> 30:31.705
the hole itself is gone,
and everything seems normal.

30:31.705 --> 30:34.458
Until another hole suddenly
opens up somewhere else,

30:34.458 --> 30:37.127
and for the next minute,
more people fall into that.

30:37.127 --> 30:38.587
You think whatever happened
to the Barkeith

30:38.587 --> 30:39.838
happened to those ships too?

30:40.923 --> 30:42.591
I can't say that.

30:42.591 --> 30:44.468
Not with this data.

30:44.468 --> 30:46.929
And I'm no expert on
those things inside the Ring.

30:46.929 --> 30:49.014
Me neither.

30:49.014 --> 30:50.849
But I know someone
who might be.

30:53.602 --> 30:55.104
Holden!
- What is it?

30:55.104 --> 30:56.272
Radar pinged three ships

30:56.272 --> 30:57.523
vectoring towards us
at high speed.

30:57.523 --> 30:58.566
IDs?

30:58.566 --> 30:59.650
No transponders.

30:59.650 --> 31:00.693
Checking drive signatures.

31:04.029 --> 31:07.241
Hey, Cap, what's going on?

31:08.284 --> 31:09.660
Everybody suit up and strap in.

31:09.660 --> 31:10.953
It's about to get hot.

31:16.208 --> 31:19.670

31:32.600 --> 31:34.727
Didn't we come here
to shoot these people?

31:39.982 --> 31:42.651
Don't worry.
We can edit that out.

31:42.651 --> 31:43.902
Sorry, ma'am.

31:48.324 --> 31:49.742
Asshole.

31:53.746 --> 31:56.957

32:33.327 --> 32:35.537
Hey. Where's your embed?

32:36.830 --> 32:39.792
God damn it.
I'll be right back.

33:28.799 --> 33:29.883
Missile lock.

33:32.720 --> 33:33.971
Take the shot.

33:38.809 --> 33:39.727
Firing.

33:57.828 --> 34:00.372
They got 'em all.
- They're closing!

34:00.372 --> 34:02.040
More torpedoes incoming!

34:02.040 --> 34:03.667
We're out of our
weight class here.

34:03.667 --> 34:05.252
I'm heating up the rail gun.

34:05.252 --> 34:06.670
We're too far away!

34:06.670 --> 34:08.172
It's the only
chance we've got.

34:08.172 --> 34:10.007
Everybody, brace
for a hard spin.

34:15.179 --> 34:17.431
Lauber is hit real bad.

34:17.431 --> 34:19.141
- They're venting atmosphere.
Idiots.

34:19.141 --> 34:20.893
Granicus is requesting permission

34:20.893 --> 34:22.186
to disengage for aid.

34:22.186 --> 34:23.812
We don't need
either of them.

34:23.812 --> 34:26.648
Flight, maintain distance
from the enemy.

34:26.648 --> 34:28.192
Watch out for when they turn.

34:28.192 --> 34:31.945
Filip, end this now.

34:31.945 --> 34:33.197
Firing.

34:41.580 --> 34:43.165
Clean miss. Fuck.

34:43.165 --> 34:45.000
Four more torpedoes incoming.

34:45.000 --> 34:46.752
We can't keep this up forever.

34:47.669 --> 34:50.130
We're damaged!
Port PDCs are misfiring!

34:50.130 --> 34:51.924
Copy that on the PDCs.

34:53.175 --> 34:55.052
- Where are you going?
- I gotta fix 'em.

34:55.052 --> 34:56.136
In the middle of the fight?

34:56.136 --> 34:57.846
That's the job, Peaches.

35:05.145 --> 35:06.146
Everyone brace!

35:16.865 --> 35:19.243
- Did we get him?
- No.

35:19.243 --> 35:20.661
Let us know if you need
to do that again.

35:20.661 --> 35:22.079
Just get those PDCs back.

35:24.414 --> 35:25.916
Give me fire control.

35:25.916 --> 35:27.709
- You got something?
- Do your spin again.

35:27.709 --> 35:29.503
- I'll take the shot.
- We're too far away.

35:29.503 --> 35:31.380
They're seeing us spin
and evading before I can fire.

35:31.380 --> 35:33.298
Just give me the shot.

35:33.298 --> 35:35.843
All right. Amos, hang on.

35:35.843 --> 35:37.427
Clarissa! Brace!

35:44.142 --> 35:45.143
Missed.
Port!

35:45.143 --> 35:46.854
They dodged to port both times.

35:48.230 --> 35:50.357
I get it. Torpedoes?

35:50.357 --> 35:52.317
Yeah, give them
something else to worry about.

35:53.026 --> 35:56.280
Four, converging,
and manual PDCs to me.

35:56.280 --> 35:58.532
Copy that. Everyone hang on.

36:36.862 --> 36:38.655
Holy shit. It worked.

36:38.655 --> 36:40.073
They're down,
but they're not out.

36:40.073 --> 36:41.533
Time to end them.

36:41.533 --> 36:42.993
- Hold your fire.
- What? Why?

36:43.869 --> 36:45.871
Marco's better as a prisoner
than a martyr.

36:45.871 --> 36:47.748
Yeah, but he's never
gonna surrender.

36:47.748 --> 36:49.082
They're not gonna
be down for long.

36:49.082 --> 36:50.292
Our window's closing.

36:50.292 --> 36:51.919
If this doesn't work, you fire.

37:00.844 --> 37:05.140
James Holden.

37:05.140 --> 37:07.351
Power down and send us
your control codes.

37:09.061 --> 37:10.854
I'll see you're treated fairly.

37:14.024 --> 37:15.567
This is your only chance.

37:25.953 --> 37:30.999
I will die before I live
at the end of your leash.

37:39.174 --> 37:40.842
Aw, fuck it, we tried.

37:40.842 --> 37:41.843
Firing one.

38:07.953 --> 38:10.580
Direct hit.
But no detonation.

38:12.833 --> 38:14.042
Reactor's ready.

38:14.042 --> 38:16.962
God damn it, a dud, now?
Fuck!

38:18.422 --> 38:19.464
Disengage...

38:21.008 --> 38:22.217
...and withdraw!

38:39.818 --> 38:42.195
The Pella's
breaking off.

38:42.195 --> 38:44.698
They're not pursuing us.

38:45.365 --> 38:47.325
- Did we win?
No.

38:47.325 --> 38:49.494
But at least we didn't lose.

38:59.963 --> 39:01.214
Lauber is in bad shape.

39:01.214 --> 39:03.550
Granicus is engaged
in rescue operations.

39:03.550 --> 39:04.926
It's not
a three-to-one advantage

39:04.926 --> 39:06.511
if two of the ships withdraw.

39:06.511 --> 39:08.638
All of our decks
have been re-pressurized,

39:08.638 --> 39:11.224
but we still have a number
of breaches in the outer hull.

39:11.224 --> 39:13.518
They baited us
with their bullets.

39:13.518 --> 39:14.895
They were smart.

39:14.895 --> 39:16.229
They were lucky.

39:16.229 --> 39:18.732
I want a new pilot
as soon as possible.

39:18.732 --> 39:21.068
One who won't shit himself
in battle.

39:21.068 --> 39:22.110
There's
an experienced hand

39:22.110 --> 39:23.070
on the Shinkusato.

39:23.070 --> 39:24.279
We fought hard.

39:25.363 --> 39:26.865
Not hard enough.

39:26.865 --> 39:28.450
I fired when you said.

39:28.450 --> 39:30.202
What was I supposed to do?

39:30.202 --> 39:31.870
You were supposed
to kill the enemy.

39:31.870 --> 39:33.038
They're not dead.

39:34.790 --> 39:36.833
- You failed.
- You failed.

39:42.422 --> 39:43.882
What did you say?

39:43.882 --> 39:45.634
This is your fault.

39:45.634 --> 39:46.760
We didn't need to be here.

39:46.760 --> 39:48.303
We didn't need
to be in this fight.

39:50.222 --> 39:51.640
You are a coward.

39:51.640 --> 39:54.643
We didn't need
to kill James Holden.

39:54.643 --> 39:56.061
That was your pride.

39:56.061 --> 39:57.979
That was you, just you,
wanted to kill the man...

39:57.979 --> 40:00.690
You are relieved of duty!

40:00.690 --> 40:05.737
Get off this deck
and out of my sight.

40:52.492 --> 40:53.660
Bosmang.

40:53.660 --> 40:55.162
Medina Station
is pleased to report

40:55.162 --> 40:59.416
that RSR-G6 was just received
at Laconia Ring gate.

40:59.416 --> 41:01.835
Operational testing will
commence as soon as possible

41:01.835 --> 41:05.213
and we will, of course,
keep you fully apprised.

41:05.213 --> 41:07.424
If this one perform
as well as the others,

41:07.424 --> 41:09.134
it will be fun.
