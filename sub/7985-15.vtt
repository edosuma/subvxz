WEBVTT

00:02.269 --> 00:03.837
We need a duet partner.

00:03.837 --> 00:05.739
ABBY LEE:
<i>My first choice would be Nia.</i>

00:05.739 --> 00:07.241
Let everyone down.

00:07.241 --> 00:10.043
Kendall, you will be
doing a duet with Maddie.

00:10.043 --> 00:11.612
Yay!

00:11.612 --> 00:13.046
Maddie's not gonna
be here tomorrow.

00:13.046 --> 00:15.148
So you want to take it
away from Kendall, then?

00:15.148 --> 00:16.416
ASHLEE:
<i>So, is Mackenzie coming back</i>

00:16.416 --> 00:18.418
even though Maddie's not
coming back next year?

00:18.418 --> 00:20.521
MELISSA:
<i>My daughter's never gonna leave</i>

00:20.521 --> 00:22.389
ALDC.

00:23.524 --> 00:25.659
ANNOUNCER:
The top junior group today,

00:25.659 --> 00:27.027
"Five in Time,"

00:27.027 --> 00:28.328
Touch of Class!
(crowd cheering)

00:28.328 --> 00:29.563
ABBY LEE:
<i>They blew it.</i>

00:29.563 --> 00:34.001
<i>I want champions on this team,</i>
<i>not losers.</i>

00:34.001 --> 00:35.702
ABBY LEE:
<i>Coming up on</i> Dance Moms...

00:35.702 --> 00:37.871
<i>The group routine is inspired</i>

00:37.871 --> 00:42.175
<i>by the new movie</i>
The Huntsman: Winter's War.

00:42.175 --> 00:44.578
Maddie, you are doing
a duet with Kendall

00:44.578 --> 00:47.614
<i>and another duet with Kalani.</i>

00:47.614 --> 00:49.516
JILL:
<i>I wonder why</i>

00:49.516 --> 00:50.717
Abby gave Maddie
two duets.

00:50.717 --> 00:52.052
JESSALYNN:
<i>I feel like Abby's gonna</i>

00:52.052 --> 00:53.353
use her as much as she can.

00:53.353 --> 00:55.989
ASHLEE: <i>Melissa told us</i>
<i>things were gonna change</i>

00:55.989 --> 00:57.824
<i>and there will be spots</i>
<i>open on the team.</i>

00:57.824 --> 00:59.993
It's hard, and you know
how I love ALDC.

00:59.993 --> 01:02.563
ABBY LEE:
<i>The show must go on.</i>

01:03.597 --> 01:04.965
(crying softly)

01:04.965 --> 01:07.935
♪ Livin' on the dance floor. ♪

01:07.935 --> 01:09.836
♪ ♪

01:12.806 --> 01:14.708
JILL:
<i>Hello!</i>

01:14.708 --> 01:16.043
Welcome back, my dear.

01:16.043 --> 01:17.377
JILL:
Kira, I'm glad you're back.

01:17.377 --> 01:18.579
We kind of had
a crappy week.

01:18.579 --> 01:20.681
<i>There's a lot of rumors</i>
<i>going around</i>

01:20.681 --> 01:22.816
<i>about Maddie</i>
<i>and Melissa leaving.</i>

01:22.816 --> 01:24.918
Melissa hasn't committed
to going or staying.

01:27.588 --> 01:29.556
We all know you're leaving
anyway, so don't worry about it.

01:30.757 --> 01:32.492
Melissa, anything to say?
No.

01:32.492 --> 01:35.228
I won't speak, because I don't
really need to anymore.

01:35.228 --> 01:37.064
JILL: Are you coming back
to be part of the team?

01:44.438 --> 01:45.439
I'm not coming back.

01:45.439 --> 01:46.506
Oh.
With my kids.

01:52.546 --> 01:54.448
JILL:
<i>Melissa finally</i>

01:54.448 --> 01:56.516
dropped the bomb.

01:56.516 --> 01:59.052
She is leaving the ALDC

01:59.052 --> 02:02.289
<i>with Maddie and Mackenzie.</i>

02:02.289 --> 02:03.624
<i>I'm sad.</i>

02:03.624 --> 02:05.359
<i>Maddie is Kendall's</i>
<i>best friend.</i>

02:05.359 --> 02:07.194
<i>Melissa's my best friend.</i>

02:07.194 --> 02:09.863
It's, like, hurtful... to know

02:09.863 --> 02:13.233
<i>that Melissa just lied</i>
<i>to my face all along.</i>

02:13.233 --> 02:15.168
(sniffles)

02:15.168 --> 02:16.637
You knew though?

02:16.637 --> 02:18.739
I didn't have
all my ducks in a row yet.

02:18.739 --> 02:20.007
The way that was
coming across before

02:20.007 --> 02:21.008
was that you were
hiding something.

02:21.008 --> 02:22.275
MELISSA:
I wasn't hiding,

02:22.275 --> 02:24.144
but I was instructed
by my attorney.

02:24.144 --> 02:27.147
ASHLEE: <i>I think Melissa leaked</i>
<i>it from the very beginning.</i>

02:27.147 --> 02:28.548
<i>It's in their best interest</i>

02:28.548 --> 02:29.816
to put it out there

02:29.816 --> 02:32.386
that Maddie is ready to move on
and do new work.

02:32.386 --> 02:33.754
Mackenzie doesn't know.

02:33.754 --> 02:36.356
So Maddie knows,
but Mackenzie doesn't?

02:36.356 --> 02:37.691
ASHLEE:
Does that mean Kenzie is not

02:37.691 --> 02:39.626
a permanent resident
of the ALDC without you here?

02:39.626 --> 02:40.627
MELISSA:
No.

02:40.627 --> 02:42.095
My daughter needs me; she's 11.

02:43.563 --> 02:45.666
HOLLY: <i>As much as we prepared</i>
<i>ourselves mentally,</i>

02:45.666 --> 02:48.969
based on the things
that we've read

02:48.969 --> 02:50.704
<i>that Maddie was leaving,</i>

02:50.704 --> 02:52.706
<i>no one was really prepared</i>
<i>for Kenzie leaving.</i>

02:52.706 --> 02:55.375
What do you think Abby's gonna
say about you leaving?

02:55.375 --> 02:56.677
I think she's
gonna be sad,

02:56.677 --> 02:58.145
but she'll be happy.

02:58.145 --> 03:00.147
JILL: Do you think
she's expecting it?
I don't know.

03:00.147 --> 03:02.716
Why don't you go tell her
before pyramid?
MELISSA: I am. I am.

03:02.716 --> 03:04.251
<i>I think it's gonna be hard</i>

03:04.251 --> 03:07.487
for Abby to let go
of both my kids.

03:09.523 --> 03:11.191
MELISSA:
<i>But that's what she wants.</i>

03:11.191 --> 03:13.326
<i>She wants the girls</i>
<i>to be stars,</i>

03:13.326 --> 03:15.862
not to be on a dance competition
team the rest of our lives.

03:15.862 --> 03:17.531
MELISSA:
Hi, it's just me.

03:18.565 --> 03:20.534
Um, I just want
to tell you,

03:20.534 --> 03:22.903
with everything
going on with Maddie,

03:22.903 --> 03:24.905
and, you know, we're just busy,

03:24.905 --> 03:28.075
and lots of things
are in the works, um...

03:29.943 --> 03:31.244
First of all,

03:31.244 --> 03:33.280
I appreciate you and
everything you've done

03:33.280 --> 03:36.683
for my kids, but we're gonna,
after this season...

03:38.652 --> 03:39.720
... we're just gonna...

03:41.021 --> 03:42.422
...not be on
the elite team anymore.

03:49.996 --> 03:51.865
It's hard. I...

03:51.865 --> 03:53.867
You know how I
love the ALDC.

03:55.335 --> 03:56.670
So the rumors are true.

03:56.670 --> 03:58.338
I don't know who
got that rumor out,

03:58.338 --> 03:59.439
'cause it wasn't me.

03:59.439 --> 04:00.841
Right.

04:03.143 --> 04:06.113
My question is:
Maddie is signed,

04:06.113 --> 04:08.749
sealed and delivered
to shoot the Sia movie.

04:08.749 --> 04:09.983
Yeah.

04:09.983 --> 04:11.184
So she's not
doing anything else

04:11.184 --> 04:12.552
between the movie and now?

04:12.552 --> 04:14.354
Um...

04:14.354 --> 04:16.923
I don't want to see them on <i>So</i>
<i>You Think You Can Dance: Kids.</i>

04:16.923 --> 04:18.592
I don't want, uh, them
doing anything like that.

04:18.592 --> 04:21.261
Don't worry, Maddie's not
gonna be... um, dance

04:21.261 --> 04:23.063
on <i>So You Think</i>
<i>You Can Dance: Kids.</i>

04:23.063 --> 04:24.998
Maddie's not going
on that, so...

04:24.998 --> 04:26.800
All right.

04:26.800 --> 04:28.769
We have four more competitions.

04:30.737 --> 04:32.539
(sniffles)

04:32.539 --> 04:33.707
We've been here for a long time.

04:42.749 --> 04:44.451
I...

04:44.451 --> 04:47.387
I didn't want to even think
about it, to be honest with you.

04:47.387 --> 04:49.222
(sniffles)
Just always want you

04:49.222 --> 04:50.490
to be proud of 'em.

04:50.490 --> 04:52.325
Oh, I'm proud of them.
I know you are.

04:52.325 --> 04:55.195
ABBY LEE:
<i>My mom always said that</i>

04:55.195 --> 04:58.331
God works in mysterious ways.

04:58.331 --> 04:59.666
<i>That's the way it goes.</i>

04:59.666 --> 05:03.336
<i>It broke my heart,</i>
<i>but the show must go on.</i>

05:03.336 --> 05:05.372
(breathes deeply)

05:05.372 --> 05:07.307
JILL:
<i>How'd it go?</i>

05:07.307 --> 05:08.642
MELISSA:
<i>We both cried.</i>

05:08.642 --> 05:10.477
Did you?
Yeah.

05:10.477 --> 05:11.945
She was just sad,

05:11.945 --> 05:13.480
but, you know, she's happy

05:13.480 --> 05:14.614
and sad.

05:14.614 --> 05:16.349
ASHLEE: So now are you
gonna tell Mackenzie

05:16.349 --> 05:17.751
for sure today?

05:17.751 --> 05:19.686
MELISSA: I want all the
girls to know today

05:19.686 --> 05:21.021
and together.

05:21.021 --> 05:22.622
I don't want to just

05:22.622 --> 05:23.957
pull Mackenzie aside, I...

05:23.957 --> 05:25.425
But you probably have
to tell Kenzie first

05:25.425 --> 05:26.693
before that's announced.

05:26.693 --> 05:28.261
I don't think I can right now.

05:28.261 --> 05:29.863
Sorry, I don't mean to interrupt
you, but I'll be right back.

05:31.698 --> 05:33.033
ABBY LEE: Hey.
ASHLEE: Hi.

05:33.033 --> 05:34.367
Hi. How are you?
I was just gonna come see...

05:34.367 --> 05:35.368
How are you?

05:36.736 --> 05:37.737
Are you serious?

05:37.737 --> 05:39.406
Oh, wow. Oh.

05:39.406 --> 05:41.007
I am totally vindicated.

05:41.007 --> 05:42.509
<i>Finally,</i>

05:42.509 --> 05:44.678
this elephant in the room
has been addressed.

05:44.678 --> 05:48.315
<i>Abby is planning on replacing</i>
<i>Maddie with Brynn.</i>

05:48.315 --> 05:50.884
It's kind of a nice day for me.

05:50.884 --> 05:52.152
Come on. You guys ready?

05:55.222 --> 05:57.390
We have a crazy

05:57.390 --> 05:58.959
busy week.

05:58.959 --> 06:00.760
So, at the bottom
of the pyramid...

06:00.760 --> 06:02.195
Kalani,

06:02.195 --> 06:03.930
you were not here.

06:03.930 --> 06:05.332
Next, Kendall.

06:05.332 --> 06:08.068
You were in the group
dance; you were fine.

06:09.336 --> 06:11.471
JoJo did a solo.

06:11.471 --> 06:13.473
♪ I like the way you move ♪

06:13.473 --> 06:16.009
♪ You got me
in the groove, baby... ♪

06:16.009 --> 06:18.011
ABBY LEE:
She did not place.

06:18.011 --> 06:19.579
Nia.

06:19.579 --> 06:21.781
You were good.
You were fine.

06:22.916 --> 06:25.352
Next, up the pyramid,
we have Mackenzie.

06:25.352 --> 06:26.519
You were outstanding
in the group.

06:26.519 --> 06:27.621
And then

06:27.621 --> 06:28.922
Maddie.

06:30.223 --> 06:31.358
Maddie, you were

06:31.358 --> 06:32.559
<i>the baseball player</i>

06:32.559 --> 06:34.561
<i>that got to slide into home.</i>

06:34.561 --> 06:35.896
<i>They loved you.</i>

06:37.297 --> 06:39.032
On top of the pyramid...

06:39.032 --> 06:40.867
Brynn.

06:40.867 --> 06:41.835
Congratulations.

06:41.835 --> 06:43.270
(applause)

06:43.270 --> 06:46.573
<i>You were in the duet</i>
<i>that did win.</i>

06:46.573 --> 06:47.607
All right,

06:47.607 --> 06:49.009
this week, we are attending

06:49.009 --> 06:52.646
FIERCE National Dance
Competition in Agoura Hills.

06:52.646 --> 06:54.781
There's gonna be
incredible kids there.

06:54.781 --> 06:56.750
Now, the group dance.

06:56.750 --> 07:01.621
The group routine is
inspired by the new movie

07:01.621 --> 07:04.291
<i>The Huntsman: Winter's War.</i>

07:04.291 --> 07:06.226
Now...

07:06.226 --> 07:07.627
this is important
that we get this right

07:07.627 --> 07:10.096
because it's a huge film.

07:10.096 --> 07:11.364
Well, we have

07:11.364 --> 07:13.400
the fire queen,
which will be played by Maddie,

07:13.400 --> 07:15.001
and the ice
queen played by

07:15.001 --> 07:16.269
cold‐hearted snake over there,

07:16.269 --> 07:17.337
Mackenzie.

07:17.337 --> 07:18.505
You're the sisters.

07:18.505 --> 07:19.439
You're dueling.

07:19.439 --> 07:21.641
You fight to the end.

07:21.641 --> 07:23.443
I've done some pretty
cool things before,

07:23.443 --> 07:25.912
<i>but</i> The Huntsman: Winter's War
<i>is up there.</i>

07:25.912 --> 07:28.548
And I'm super excited because
I've always wanted to battle her

07:28.548 --> 07:30.383
<i>in a dance.</i>

07:30.383 --> 07:32.752
<i>Everyone knows</i>
<i>that I'm the winner.</i>

07:32.752 --> 07:34.254
ABBY LEE:
We are doing three duets.

07:34.254 --> 07:35.155
So, Nia...

07:36.589 --> 07:37.924
...you are doing a duet,

07:37.924 --> 07:41.628
and your partner
is Mackenzie.

07:41.628 --> 07:43.196
MELISSA:
Aw, that's so awesome.

07:43.196 --> 07:47.534
ABBY LEE: This piece is
entitled "The Long Good‐bye."

07:48.902 --> 07:51.905
Last time I did a duet
was with Kendall,

07:51.905 --> 07:55.608
and I don't think
I did my best that day.

07:55.608 --> 07:56.710
<i>So I really hope</i>

07:56.710 --> 07:58.378
to redeem myself
from the last one.

07:58.378 --> 08:01.614
ABBY LEE:
Maddie, last week,

08:01.614 --> 08:02.615
you didn't do your duet.

08:02.615 --> 08:05.919
You are doing a duet
with Kendall.

08:05.919 --> 08:06.987
(Melissa laughs)

08:08.054 --> 08:09.589
KENDALL:
<i>I am so happy.</i>

08:09.589 --> 08:12.158
I am doing a duet with my
favorite person in the world,

08:12.158 --> 08:13.960
<i>and we won a lot together.</i>

08:13.960 --> 08:15.595
<i>And I can't wait</i>

08:15.595 --> 08:17.964
to see what it is, and I hope
it's creepy and scary,

08:17.964 --> 08:19.833
because that's what we do best
with each other.

08:19.833 --> 08:21.735
ABBY LEE:
All right.

08:21.735 --> 08:25.105
My last duet goes to
Maddie and Kalani.

08:28.241 --> 08:29.776
KALANI: All the weeks
that you're gonna miss,

08:29.776 --> 08:31.578
you have to make up
all those dances.

08:31.578 --> 08:34.114
(laughter)

08:34.114 --> 08:36.516
ABBY LEE: The name of your
duet is "Unbreak My Heart."

08:36.516 --> 08:38.618
And it's inspirational,

08:38.618 --> 08:41.488
and it's a
lyrical piece.

08:41.488 --> 08:43.757
<i>I'm sure everybody</i>
<i>thinks I have</i>

08:43.757 --> 08:47.193
lost my mind,
competing three separate duets

08:47.193 --> 08:49.529
and featuring Maddie
in all but one of them.

08:49.529 --> 08:51.197

33:12.123 --> 33:14.125
Well, I guess I would be
confident onstage

if Maddie was
next to me, too.

33:15.193 --> 33:16.528

33:16.528 --> 33:18.396
But you‐you have that,

33:18.396 --> 33:20.065

there on your solo,

33:20.065 --> 33:21.366

look like that.

33:21.366 --> 33:23.335

that feeling today

33:23.335 --> 33:24.669

<i>one of those two duets</i>

39:31.870 --> 39:33.404
would win.

39:33.404 --> 39:36.741
<i>Hopefully,</i>
<i>it's Maddie and Kalani.</i>

39:36.741 --> 39:38.443
Maybe it'll be a tie.

39:38.443 --> 39:41.846
Second overall,
act number 27.

39:41.846 --> 39:43.581
(crowd cheering)

39:43.581 --> 39:45.183
Good job.

39:47.518 --> 39:50.488
And your teen advanced
duo/trios first overall

39:50.488 --> 39:54.325
is act 21, "Unbreak my Heart"!

39:54.325 --> 39:55.560
(whooping)

39:55.560 --> 39:56.995
(crowd cheering)

39:59.163 --> 40:01.399
MADDIE:
<i>I am so excited that I won</i>

40:01.399 --> 40:04.869
for my duet with Kalani, but I'm
also excited that I got second

40:04.869 --> 40:07.939
<i>with Kendall, because I thought</i>
<i>both of the duets were amazing.</i>

40:07.939 --> 40:09.774
I need to treasure this moment
while I can.

40:09.774 --> 40:12.744
Okay, the top groups
of the entire day.

40:15.914 --> 40:18.116
JILL: <i>This is a big day</i>
<i>for our girls.</i>

40:18.116 --> 40:20.818
<i>And now with this news of</i>
<i>Maddie and Mackenzie leaving,</i>

40:20.818 --> 40:23.788
it's really important
for our girls to show

40:23.788 --> 40:26.524
<i>the world how amazing</i>
<i>they really are.</i>

40:26.524 --> 40:30.295
Not to mention that Abby
will be really ticked off

40:30.295 --> 40:31.863
<i>if they don't win today.</i>

40:31.863 --> 40:33.464
ANNOUNCER:
In second place,

40:33.464 --> 40:34.899
we have act

40:34.899 --> 40:38.569
number 66, "Winter's War."

40:38.569 --> 40:39.904
(crowd cheering)

40:43.942 --> 40:45.176
ASHLEE:
<i>Our group dance</i>

40:45.176 --> 40:47.478
doesn't win
for the second week in a row.

40:47.478 --> 40:49.781
<i>I think that's a blow</i>
<i>to everybody's morale.</i>

40:49.781 --> 40:53.952
<i>I think the announcement</i>
<i>from Melissa had a huge impact</i>

40:53.952 --> 40:55.286
on how our week went.

40:55.286 --> 40:56.854
<i>It was the crappiest timing</i>

40:56.854 --> 40:58.456
<i>it could've possibly been.</i>

40:58.456 --> 41:02.160
JILL: <i>We have not had</i>
<i>a costume malfunction in</i>

41:02.160 --> 41:03.828
years!

41:03.828 --> 41:05.596
When it comes down to
everything is good,

41:05.596 --> 41:07.632
and we have costume pieces
falling off,

41:07.632 --> 41:10.401
that could've been
where we lost points.

41:10.401 --> 41:13.104
HOLLY: Abby, you seem
a little sour right now.

41:13.104 --> 41:14.205
Are you sour because

41:14.205 --> 41:15.807
we're fussing
about the costumes

41:15.807 --> 41:17.442
or because we didn't win or...?

41:17.442 --> 41:19.711
It's like you just
kind of shut down.

41:20.979 --> 41:22.513
ABBY LEE:
I'm tired, I'm sick.

41:22.513 --> 41:23.715
My head's pounding.

41:23.715 --> 41:26.150
It has been for a week
now, week and a half.

41:26.150 --> 41:28.453
Are you sure though that
it's just not because Maddie

41:28.453 --> 41:29.887
and Mackenzie told you
they were leaving this week?

41:36.661 --> 41:38.496
Let's go. Come on.

41:42.367 --> 41:44.202
JESSALYNN: Maddie and
Mackenzie are leaving;

41:44.202 --> 41:45.803
she's checked out.
HOLLY: She's checked out.

41:45.803 --> 41:47.972
She's checked out.
MELISSA: You know,
she has a lot on her plate.

41:49.273 --> 41:50.775
She has to focus on one thing.

41:54.712 --> 41:56.414
ABBY LEE:
<i>Next on</i> Dance Moms...

41:56.414 --> 41:58.016
We're having three soloists.

41:58.016 --> 42:01.753
Mackenzie, you are doing
a gymnastic routine.

42:01.753 --> 42:04.188
Mackenzie's amazing at hip‐hop.
Please, please!

42:04.188 --> 42:05.623
So then you're not
gonna do a solo.

42:05.623 --> 42:07.358
Oh, my God!

42:07.358 --> 42:08.793
<i>I'm gonna stand up</i>
<i>for my daughter.</i>

42:08.793 --> 42:09.994
I just want to talk to you
real quick.

42:09.994 --> 42:11.863
(gasps)
Get out!

42:11.863 --> 42:13.564
That woman is crazy.

42:13.564 --> 42:15.867
JESSALYNN: <i>Ashlee has dressed up</i>
<i>Brynn like JoJo.</i>

42:15.867 --> 42:18.269
You're probably like,
"Wow, my kid has some style

42:18.269 --> 42:19.771
and some
personality today."

42:19.771 --> 42:22.673
JILL: Brynn's not the next
Maddie, she's the next JoJo!

42:22.673 --> 42:23.875
Your kid has no character!

42:23.875 --> 42:24.876
