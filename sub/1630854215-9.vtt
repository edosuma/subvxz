WEBVTT

00:02.480 --> 00:04.656
After six open houses,

00:04.830 --> 00:08.051
I am sure that
"fixer-upper" means decrepit.

00:08.225 --> 00:10.967
Well, part of the fun
is imagining what
something could be.

00:11.141 --> 00:13.535
It could be expensive

00:13.709 --> 00:15.841
and messy and loud
and even dangerous.

00:18.844 --> 00:20.803
Hey, why don't
you do your thing
with the real estate agent?

00:20.977 --> 00:21.804
I'm gonna go wander.

00:24.024 --> 00:25.547
Hi.

00:25.721 --> 00:27.549
Tori Vargas. Any questions?

00:27.723 --> 00:29.159
Oh, yes, I have many.

00:29.333 --> 00:31.248
About school districts,
drought-tolerant landscaping,

00:31.422 --> 00:32.902
seismic retrofitting--

00:33.076 --> 00:34.773
Someone came prepared.

00:34.947 --> 00:36.862
Does that include
loan pre-approval?

00:37.037 --> 00:39.082
- If not, I can help.
- Oh, no.

00:39.256 --> 00:42.042
Going to open houses
out of our price range
is our new hobby,

00:42.216 --> 00:43.913
and sometimes,
there are cookies.

00:44.087 --> 00:46.133
How fun!
Uh, excuse me just a sec.

00:47.699 --> 00:49.049
Hi, there.

01:03.802 --> 01:06.675
I grew up with a reading nook
just like this one.

01:06.849 --> 01:09.634
I'd lay in a pile of pillows,
watch the falling snow.

01:10.722 --> 01:14.248
That sounds... uncomfortable.

01:14.422 --> 01:16.076
A lot of the work
is just cosmetic.

01:16.250 --> 01:17.555
I could do most of it myself.

01:17.729 --> 01:20.471
Make it a perfect family home.

01:20.645 --> 01:22.560
Like, these window frames
are just painted shut,

01:22.734 --> 01:23.518
but all you have to do is...

01:26.651 --> 01:28.914
- Ow! Damn it.
- See?

01:30.568 --> 01:31.265
Dangerous.

01:33.223 --> 01:34.137
Forks and knives?

01:34.311 --> 01:36.008
Hands only.

01:36.183 --> 01:36.966
And don't you drown
my shao bing in hot sauce.

01:38.576 --> 01:39.273
Yes, ma'am.

01:42.667 --> 01:45.627
A scallion omelet
and sesame flatbread.

01:45.801 --> 01:47.019
Mm! Did I forget
an anniversary?

01:50.066 --> 01:52.068
This is a thank-you
for planning
our first road trip.

01:56.290 --> 01:56.942
Mm!

01:58.248 --> 01:59.162
I'm planning more road trips.

02:00.816 --> 02:02.992
I can't wait
to head south on PCH.

02:03.166 --> 02:05.125
Last trip was a solo one
on my Ducati.

02:05.299 --> 02:06.430
Hold on.

02:07.779 --> 02:08.476
You're a biker chick?

02:09.390 --> 02:11.000
Was. In another life.

02:13.045 --> 02:13.698
You miss it?

02:14.786 --> 02:16.832
The other life?

02:17.006 --> 02:19.748
Motorcycles are too dangerous.
You could end up paralyzed.

02:19.922 --> 02:21.880
Nice deflection.

02:24.666 --> 02:25.493
I didn't know you
in the other life.

02:27.016 --> 02:27.712
I like this one.

02:32.239 --> 02:33.240
Still feel that way
if I go get the hot sauce?

02:47.776 --> 02:48.951
We haven't had a chance
to talk about--

02:49.125 --> 02:51.301
You kissing me.

02:51.475 --> 02:54.348
Thereby crossing a line
you said we shouldn't cross,

02:54.522 --> 02:56.393
right as I
was headed on a date.

02:58.134 --> 02:59.179
How'd that go?

02:59.353 --> 03:00.267
Great.

03:02.486 --> 03:04.053
I barely heard a word he said,

03:04.227 --> 03:06.795
because the whole time,
I was thinking about our kiss.

03:09.450 --> 03:10.755
It was-- It was amazing.

03:12.366 --> 03:13.758
Yes, it was.

03:15.630 --> 03:17.327
Look, I like you,

03:18.633 --> 03:20.243
but I need some clarity here.

03:21.244 --> 03:22.245
Right.

03:24.378 --> 03:25.074
Let me be clear.

03:26.858 --> 03:29.861
How about I make you dinner
tomorrow, my place,

03:30.035 --> 03:30.775
and we talk about
where we're headed?

03:35.084 --> 03:35.780
Sounds good.

03:37.086 --> 03:37.782
It's a date then.

03:39.349 --> 03:41.090
A date.

03:47.966 --> 03:49.229
Oh.

03:49.403 --> 03:50.882
Good morning, Dr. Lim.

03:51.056 --> 03:52.144
Did Clay stay over last night?

03:53.320 --> 03:55.539
- He did.
- Excellent.

03:55.713 --> 03:57.541
That means you are likely
in a good mood and amenable
because of the sex.

03:59.021 --> 04:00.152
Amenable to what?

04:00.327 --> 04:01.328
I think you will like it.

04:03.808 --> 04:04.592
There was movement,

04:04.766 --> 04:06.811
flexion, and lateral rotation,

04:06.985 --> 04:09.553
which means that there was
engagement with the psoas

04:09.727 --> 04:11.599
and the glutes,
and I saw it twice.

04:13.557 --> 04:15.124
Signals are getting through
to your spinal column.

04:17.561 --> 04:19.520
This deformity
is not just scar tissue.

04:19.694 --> 04:20.651
It's a compressive syrinx.

04:20.825 --> 04:22.392
We can enter from
a midline myelotomy

04:22.566 --> 04:24.264
and drain the fluid
after we de-tether your cord.

04:27.484 --> 04:28.485
I could--

04:28.659 --> 04:29.573
You could walk again.

04:32.750 --> 04:35.057
Audrey, this approach
is much safer

04:35.231 --> 04:36.319
than the one
we discussed last time.

04:44.545 --> 04:45.850
I need time to think it over.

04:47.156 --> 04:47.852
Of course.

04:53.031 --> 04:56.557
Okay, today is the first day
I will be implementing
my new system.

04:56.731 --> 04:59.299
I'm sure you agree
it is a major improvement.

04:59.473 --> 05:00.778
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

05:00.952 --> 05:03.607
My new rating system
for first-year residents?

05:03.781 --> 05:05.566
I e-mailed you multiple drafts.

05:05.740 --> 05:07.394
You never responded.

05:07.568 --> 05:08.612
Once all the data is in,

05:08.786 --> 05:10.310
I will share
the completed version.

05:10.484 --> 05:11.485
Well, can't wait.

05:20.581 --> 05:22.713
Whoa!

05:22.887 --> 05:23.801
When I asked to see
where you worked,

05:23.975 --> 05:25.716
I didn't mean it
as a challenge.

05:25.890 --> 05:28.676
I had to get you on the mat
to see if you exaggerated
on your profile.

05:28.850 --> 05:29.894
I'm-- I'm not really a fan
of walks on the beach.

05:30.591 --> 05:31.809
Whoa!

05:31.983 --> 05:33.158
Sunsets are overrated.

05:33.333 --> 05:33.985
All right.

05:37.162 --> 05:37.902
Whoa!

05:39.339 --> 05:40.209
Nice.

05:49.044 --> 05:50.437
What happens on a third date?

05:53.222 --> 05:53.918
Lily?

05:55.616 --> 05:56.878
Lily?

06:00.011 --> 06:01.361
Are you okay?

06:13.198 --> 06:15.113
My new system has over
50 unique metrics

06:15.287 --> 06:16.680
that go into your scores.

06:16.854 --> 06:18.726
Everything you do
will be assessed.

06:18.900 --> 06:20.380
Everything? Uh, could you be
a bit more specific?

06:20.554 --> 06:21.946
No.

06:22.120 --> 06:23.034
Is this like
a head-to-head competition?

06:23.208 --> 06:24.296
It's designed to make you aware

06:24.471 --> 06:26.255
of your individual
strengths and weaknesses.

06:26.429 --> 06:27.865
Residents with more strengths
are more likely

06:28.039 --> 06:29.824
to get invited back
for a full residency.

06:34.176 --> 06:36.265
Hi, Teddy. Dr. Powell.

06:36.439 --> 06:38.572
What happened to your head?

06:38.746 --> 06:41.444
I idiotically smacked myself
with a 20-pound kettlebell.

06:41.618 --> 06:42.924
Kettlebell injuries
are surprisingly common.

06:43.838 --> 06:45.230
My gym has a printout

06:45.405 --> 06:45.970
of ten different ways
you can hurt yourself.

06:47.276 --> 06:48.320
Did you witness the accident?

06:48.495 --> 06:50.235
Yeah. I'm there
for all his workouts.

06:50.410 --> 06:51.628
Oh, so you're his trainer.

06:51.802 --> 06:52.847
His brother.

06:53.021 --> 06:54.762
My <i>baby</i> brother.

06:54.936 --> 06:56.024
He's got a real knack
for making me suffer.

06:57.895 --> 06:59.419
All right.

06:59.593 --> 07:02.552
We're gonna run a full
concussion protocol

07:02.726 --> 07:03.466
and get a CT as a precaution.

07:06.469 --> 07:07.470
Not until
we take care of this gash.

07:09.864 --> 07:12.127
You're also experiencing
abdominal pain.

07:12.301 --> 07:13.302
- Did that pain start...
- Aah!

07:13.476 --> 07:15.347
...before or after
you hit your head?

07:15.522 --> 07:17.828
Uh, kind of simultaneous?

07:19.743 --> 07:20.527
Do you mind lifting your shirt?

07:28.796 --> 07:29.623
Teddy, you've recently
lost a lot of weight.

07:30.537 --> 07:31.494
Seventy pounds.

07:31.668 --> 07:33.148
In five months.

07:33.322 --> 07:35.019
Getting that summer
beach bod ready.

07:35.193 --> 07:36.543
Keeping the T-shirt on for now.

07:39.633 --> 07:41.156
Teddy, do you mind
if we laid you back

07:41.330 --> 07:42.418
just to get a better look?

07:52.689 --> 07:54.691
Oh, got a lump.

07:54.865 --> 07:56.954
An inguinal hernia.
It's not reducible.

07:57.128 --> 07:58.129
I think it's also strangulated.

08:02.917 --> 08:06.529
Hmm, Dr. Perez is right.

08:06.703 --> 08:08.270
The blood flow
to your herniated intestine
has been cut off.

08:08.444 --> 08:10.794
You need immediate surgery. Okay.

08:19.586 --> 08:21.283
This is Lily.
37, dizziness, epistaxis,

08:21.457 --> 08:22.719
purulent nasal discharge.

08:22.893 --> 08:24.155
Let's get full labs
including blood cultures.

08:26.418 --> 08:28.246
I guess the upside
of dating a doctor

08:28.420 --> 08:29.421
is no waiting in the ER.

08:32.729 --> 08:35.602
I dated a guy at the DMV
for that very reason.

08:37.038 --> 08:38.343
Do you have a history
of nosebleeds?

08:38.518 --> 08:39.519
Yes.

08:39.693 --> 08:40.824
Part of my perpetual

08:40.998 --> 08:42.478
sinus infection.

08:42.652 --> 08:44.306
I've been on and off
antibiotics for a year.

08:44.480 --> 08:47.004
I figured it's because
I teach Kung Fu to kids.

08:47.178 --> 08:48.919
Mm, adorable.

08:49.093 --> 08:50.268
Do you feel any sinus pressure?

08:50.442 --> 08:51.618
Also, how'd you two meet?

08:54.011 --> 08:56.797
Yes, and Bumble?

08:56.971 --> 08:58.842
Thank you, Dr. Reznick.
I got this.

08:59.016 --> 09:00.104
He's worried
this will be awkward
because I'm his ex.

09:01.758 --> 09:02.977
Don't worry. We're friends now.

09:03.151 --> 09:04.544
Any other recent symptoms?

09:06.763 --> 09:08.286
I've had a few migraines

09:08.460 --> 09:10.550
and bad taste
in my mouth recently.

09:10.724 --> 09:12.160
Temp's elevated,
and she's hypertensive.

09:12.334 --> 09:14.728
Acute-on-chronic
bacterial rhinosinusitis?

09:16.077 --> 09:17.644
Probably,
but given the headaches,

09:17.818 --> 09:18.862
I want a stat
brain and sinus CT

09:19.036 --> 09:19.689
with and without contrast.

09:22.823 --> 09:25.216
Hernia is reduced.

09:25.390 --> 09:27.610
Next step in the tension-free
hernioplasty?

09:27.784 --> 09:29.133
Use mesh
to cover the fascial defect.

09:30.613 --> 09:32.223
By strengthening
the inguinal floor,

09:32.397 --> 09:34.443
we hope to prevent
further hernias.

09:34.617 --> 09:37.228
No extra credit will be given
for statements of the obvious.

09:42.103 --> 09:43.844
It's impressive how much
weight Teddy's lost.

09:44.018 --> 09:45.672
I just hope he's doing it
for the right reasons.

09:45.846 --> 09:47.064
Hard to see a wrong reason.

09:47.238 --> 09:48.805
He was clearly
pretty overweight.

09:48.979 --> 09:50.067
I agree.

09:50.241 --> 09:52.722
Obesity increases
health risks for diabetes,

09:52.896 --> 09:55.420
heart disease,
and some cancers.

09:55.595 --> 09:59.337
Fair. But our culture
can really go overboard
on the fat-shaming,

09:59.511 --> 10:01.557
which can lead to
low self-esteem, depression,

10:01.731 --> 10:03.472
none of which is healthy.

10:03.646 --> 10:05.909
Trying to change
to please someone else
rarely works.

10:07.215 --> 10:08.869
Getting someone you love

10:09.043 --> 10:10.610
to do what is best for them
is a good thing.

10:13.569 --> 10:16.572
There's ectopy in the EKG.
QT looks prolonged.

10:16.746 --> 10:18.661
Push 2 grams IV of magnesium.

10:21.621 --> 10:23.231
He's going into torsades.

10:23.405 --> 10:24.362
Proper response?

10:24.536 --> 10:25.189
Synchronized cardioversion.

10:26.321 --> 10:27.278
Yes. Prepare to shock him.

10:31.500 --> 10:33.197
Charging 200 joules. Clear.

10:42.380 --> 10:43.686
Good catch, Dr. Powell.

10:45.514 --> 10:48.038
I caught
the strangulated hernia.

10:48.212 --> 10:50.867
Teddy's arrhythmia
is likely a sign
of an underlying condition.

10:51.041 --> 10:52.564
It could be quite dangerous.

10:52.739 --> 10:54.915
Next, you will be assessed on
how quickly and accurately

10:55.089 --> 10:55.916
you can determine
what's causing it.

10:56.090 --> 10:56.743
Suture scissors.

11:07.884 --> 11:09.103
I'll start with the sinuses.

11:10.495 --> 11:12.759
Hey, I found you
a new prospect.

11:12.933 --> 11:15.152
Unless your last date
was a love connection
for the ages.

11:15.326 --> 11:17.198
- That's a no.
- Oh. Hmm.

11:17.372 --> 11:20.984
How terrible for him.
How exciting for me.

11:21.158 --> 11:23.595
Berkeley law grad,
former fitness model,

11:23.770 --> 11:25.685
just moved back
to the valley from Paris.

11:25.859 --> 11:27.512
Thanks, but I'll pass.

11:30.428 --> 11:31.995
That's severe opacification.

11:32.169 --> 11:34.171
Sinus mucosa's thickened.

11:34.345 --> 11:36.260
There's already bony erosion.

11:36.434 --> 11:37.479
Lily needs endoscopic

11:37.653 --> 11:38.567
sinonasal debridement.

11:40.134 --> 11:42.440
He's smart, he's ripped,
he's worldly,

11:42.614 --> 11:44.747
and unlike Perez,
he's available.

11:44.921 --> 11:46.401
- We kissed.
- What?

11:46.575 --> 11:48.098
You and Perez?

11:48.272 --> 11:50.666
- Yeah.
- What about his
recovery-related boundaries?

11:50.840 --> 11:52.363
I haven't figured that out yet,

11:52.537 --> 11:55.671
but he did invite me
to dinner at his place.

11:57.847 --> 11:58.848
I'm exploring.

12:01.329 --> 12:03.331
Just be careful, okay?

12:04.854 --> 12:05.507
Okay.

12:10.294 --> 12:12.253
Her sinus infection spread
through her skull base.

12:12.427 --> 12:15.386
That's a massive
6x4 centimeter abscess.

12:15.560 --> 12:16.953
Page Park.
If that thing ruptures,
she'll die.

12:17.127 --> 12:19.303
Lily needs sinus
and brain surgery.

12:29.574 --> 12:31.663
Sinus debridement
looks very good, Dr. Allen.

12:31.838 --> 12:32.664
Pulling the scope.

12:34.188 --> 12:36.451
Bacitracin-coated Telfa.

12:36.625 --> 12:39.759
And we use two burr holes
to drain the abscess
using ultrasound guidance.

12:45.068 --> 12:46.678
So,
how'd you get approval

12:46.853 --> 12:48.811
to operate on your
new girlfriend?

12:48.985 --> 12:50.770
Two dates
does not equal a girlfriend.
No approval necessary.

12:53.163 --> 12:54.338
Trajectories look good.

12:54.512 --> 12:55.339
Drainage tool.

12:57.559 --> 12:59.169
Plus or minus
that you got to parade her
in front of Morgan?

13:00.475 --> 13:01.737
Definitely not parading,

13:01.911 --> 13:03.347
and Morgan and I are...

13:05.045 --> 13:06.307
friends, so neither.

13:06.481 --> 13:07.351
Uh-huh.

13:10.877 --> 13:13.096
Mm, this is as much
as I can get

13:13.270 --> 13:15.316
without risking rupture
into the ventricle.

13:15.490 --> 13:17.492
Eh, the rest is up
to the antibiotics.

13:17.666 --> 13:18.362
Leave the drain and close.

13:21.191 --> 13:22.105
Would you say

13:22.279 --> 13:23.803
you loved, liked, or hated

13:23.977 --> 13:25.456
the last house we saw?

13:25.630 --> 13:27.371
Are those the only options?

13:27.545 --> 13:28.895
I should examine your hand.

13:29.069 --> 13:30.287
Oh, it's fine.

13:30.461 --> 13:32.333
I can't stop thinking
about the crown molding

13:32.507 --> 13:33.900
and the reading nook,

13:34.074 --> 13:35.336
so as long
as you don't hate it,

13:35.510 --> 13:37.294
I'm thinking we should
talk to a mortgage broker

13:37.468 --> 13:38.382
about making an offer.

13:41.733 --> 13:43.561
You said going to open houses

13:43.735 --> 13:44.998
was only for fun.

13:45.172 --> 13:46.390
I've looked at our finances,
and we can swing it.

13:47.304 --> 13:48.697
Rent is spent.

13:48.871 --> 13:50.264
A mortgage payment is...

13:50.438 --> 13:52.048
whatever rhymes with payment

13:52.222 --> 13:52.919
and--
and means good investment.

13:54.746 --> 13:57.184
My research shows
we should adhere

13:57.358 --> 14:01.014
to the 28/36 rule with regards
to monthly pre-tax income.

14:01.188 --> 14:02.711
You have swelling around
your second digit's metacarpal

14:02.885 --> 14:04.626
and the proximal phalanx
of your thumb.

14:04.800 --> 14:05.583
Okay, I've done worse
on engine blocks.

14:05.757 --> 14:09.761
Shaun, we can be homeowners.

14:09.936 --> 14:11.372
Doesn't that
excite you even a little?

14:11.546 --> 14:12.416
Hmm.

14:14.201 --> 14:17.073
I am a little excited
that you are excited.

14:17.247 --> 14:19.423
Good, because I made
an appointment

14:19.597 --> 14:20.860
with a mortgage broker.

14:21.034 --> 14:22.774
And you guys can talk 25/36.

14:28.258 --> 14:28.911
Twenty-eight.

14:56.460 --> 14:58.419
You know, it's silly
for us to be competitive.

14:58.593 --> 15:00.029
Said the loser while losing.

15:01.117 --> 15:03.206
Olive branch.

15:03.380 --> 15:04.947
I don't know what's
causing the arrhythmia. Do you?

15:05.861 --> 15:06.775
I have ideas.

15:08.777 --> 15:10.474
O-kay.

15:10.648 --> 15:13.782
So you can present them
and land the knockout blow...

15:13.956 --> 15:15.001
if you're confident
that you're right.

15:17.264 --> 15:18.874
- Or?
- Or we can bounce ideas
off each other,

15:19.048 --> 15:20.049
get the right answer,
and help this guy.

15:22.660 --> 15:24.140
For all we know,
one of Dr. Murphy's metrics

15:24.314 --> 15:26.490
is cooperation
amongst colleagues.

15:28.623 --> 15:29.624
Fine.

15:29.798 --> 15:30.494
But I present.

15:31.974 --> 15:33.976
Do you have any idea
how often women

15:34.150 --> 15:35.499
get zero credit
for their ideas,

15:35.673 --> 15:36.848
even when they come
out of their mouths?

15:37.023 --> 15:40.026
Fine.

15:40.200 --> 15:42.419
Blood sample
showed critically low potassium
and sodium,

15:42.593 --> 15:44.813
which makes no sense
given the power-food diet

15:44.987 --> 15:46.597
that his brother's got him on.

15:46.771 --> 15:47.729
There's plenty of nutrients.

15:47.903 --> 15:49.600
- So maybe celiac.
- Mm.

15:49.774 --> 15:52.081
IgA and IgG antibody tests
were normal.

15:53.909 --> 15:55.084
I'm thinking
primary aldosteronism.

15:56.607 --> 15:58.914
That's interesting.

15:59.088 --> 16:01.351
Please present your ideas
on what is causing
our patient's arrhythmia.

16:04.659 --> 16:07.531
We think that Teddy
has primary aldosteronism.

16:09.011 --> 16:11.057
Explains initial
electrolyte levels and...

16:15.844 --> 16:18.194
That doesn't align
with urine studies
or lack of hypertension.

16:18.368 --> 16:18.978
This was your idea.

16:20.196 --> 16:22.068
Congenital long QT syndrome.

16:22.242 --> 16:24.070
Teddy's QT levels
have returned to normal,

16:24.244 --> 16:26.028
and he has no family history.

16:26.202 --> 16:29.814
He has critically low
levels of potassium,
sodium, and magnesium.

16:29.989 --> 16:31.773
I noticed that.
Despite a good diet.

16:31.947 --> 16:33.557
It suggests absorption and--

16:36.517 --> 16:39.389
What happened to cooperation
amongst colleagues?

16:39.563 --> 16:40.564
I didn't realize
you were gonna be wrong.

16:43.480 --> 16:45.352
Slight enamel erosion
on the molars

16:45.526 --> 16:46.918
and trauma to the oral mucosa.

16:49.051 --> 16:52.881
And these tiny abrasions
on his knuckles
are from his teeth.

16:53.055 --> 16:54.535
Self-induced vomiting
led to malnutrition,

16:54.709 --> 16:55.579
which caused the arrhythmia.

16:56.972 --> 16:58.930
Teddy, you are bulimic.

17:09.463 --> 17:11.682
That's quite the cocktail.

17:11.856 --> 17:13.684
Not the kind I was hoping
we'd share, but here we are.

17:15.556 --> 17:18.124
Not exactly what I would
have worn either.

17:18.298 --> 17:20.996
We're hoping the antibiotics
will clear the remaining
infected areas

17:21.170 --> 17:22.128
of your sinuses and brain.

17:24.260 --> 17:26.567
I feel like I'm already getting
the VIP treatment from you.

17:27.481 --> 17:29.178
Dr. Reznick was right.

17:29.352 --> 17:31.615
She said your flower game
was very solid.

17:35.010 --> 17:36.011
She stopped by?

17:36.185 --> 17:36.838
Yes.

17:38.709 --> 17:40.233
Ostensibly to check on me,

17:41.625 --> 17:42.974
but mostly
to sing your praises.

17:44.541 --> 17:46.282
Not many guys
have an ex as a hype man.

17:47.109 --> 17:48.110
Lucky me.

17:55.161 --> 17:56.814
I think it's too soon
to discharge Teddy.

17:56.988 --> 17:59.730
He has responded well
to electrolyte replacement,

17:59.904 --> 18:01.384
there are no signs
of recurrent arrhythmia,

18:01.558 --> 18:03.473
and the hernioplasty only
requires simple wound care.

18:05.127 --> 18:06.911
- He's bulimic.
- I know.

18:07.086 --> 18:08.609
I diagnosed him, thank you,

18:08.783 --> 18:11.220
after you and Dr. Powell
failed to.

18:11.394 --> 18:13.744
Eating disorders have
the highest mortality rate
of any mental illness.

18:15.833 --> 18:18.923
I referred him
for a psych consult

18:19.098 --> 18:21.361
and provided a list of clinics
for eating disorders.

18:21.535 --> 18:24.842
He needs help now,
not in a few weeks.

18:25.016 --> 18:27.149
Give me some time.
Maybe I can get psych to talk
to him before he leaves.

18:27.323 --> 18:30.196
Points are given
for passion and commitment

18:30.370 --> 18:32.241
and taken away for arguing
with an attending.

18:32.415 --> 18:33.242
I don't care about the points.

18:35.636 --> 18:38.378
We can't keep him hospitalized

18:38.552 --> 18:40.554
without a clear
surgical indication.

18:48.823 --> 18:50.129
Stop hounding me.

18:50.303 --> 18:52.392
I'm having a coffee.
Can I have a coffee?

18:52.566 --> 18:53.871
You're hovering.

18:54.045 --> 18:55.612
I'm excited about the prospect

18:55.786 --> 18:57.440
of getting you
back on your feet.

18:59.660 --> 19:02.228
This surgery
is not an easy decision.

19:02.402 --> 19:03.925
The surgical plan
is a very good one.

19:04.099 --> 19:06.406
Yes, it's a solid plan.

19:06.580 --> 19:07.494
But?

19:09.235 --> 19:13.413
But my life is good right now,
really good.

19:13.587 --> 19:14.979
Better than it's been
in a while.

19:15.154 --> 19:16.807
And the idea of that
changing is--

19:16.981 --> 19:18.896
Lea said we would
go to open houses
as a fun hobby,

19:19.070 --> 19:20.724
but now she wants to buy one.

19:20.898 --> 19:21.986
- Shaun, I'm in
the middle of a--
- No, you're not.

19:28.167 --> 19:30.821
A house?
Okay, well, congratulations.

19:30.995 --> 19:32.475
Look at you two, grown-up-ing.

19:32.649 --> 19:34.912
No, it's a fixer-upper.

19:35.086 --> 19:35.957
Dr. Glassman, I don't like it.

19:37.088 --> 19:39.003
Did you tell Lea that?

19:39.178 --> 19:42.659
No, she is excited when
she talks about the house.
It makes her happy.

19:42.833 --> 19:44.748
And I think
she has been sad lately.

19:45.836 --> 19:47.360
Why has she been sad?

19:47.534 --> 19:49.536
I told you,
we have to wait to get pregnant

19:49.710 --> 19:52.147
because of her
Asherman's syndrome.

19:52.321 --> 19:55.803
Well, maybe Lea
is looking for a way
to move you two forward.

19:57.108 --> 20:00.590
You think if we buy that house,

20:00.764 --> 20:02.723
Lea will be less sad?

20:02.897 --> 20:04.725
I don't know, but, you know,
buying a house can be exciting.

20:04.899 --> 20:06.683
It's a distraction.
Distractions can be useful.

20:06.857 --> 20:08.642
No, no, no.
I do not like distractions.

20:08.816 --> 20:10.905
Shaun...

20:11.079 --> 20:13.124
you've been rating residents
for quite a while now,

20:13.299 --> 20:15.214
and now all of a sudden,
you revamp your entire system?

20:15.388 --> 20:17.128
When did you decide to do that?

20:17.303 --> 20:19.348
Mm, after the sextuplets
were born.

20:19.522 --> 20:20.958
Wasn't that
around the same time

20:21.132 --> 20:23.222
you found out about
Lea's Asherman's?

20:23.396 --> 20:24.745
Yes.

20:24.919 --> 20:26.529
We were both very sad.

20:29.315 --> 20:33.101
You think my new system
was a distraction?

20:33.275 --> 20:34.276
Yeah, and-- and now
maybe Lea needs one.

20:35.451 --> 20:37.758
Oh, excellent idea.

20:37.932 --> 20:39.238
Thank you, Dr. Glassman.

20:48.986 --> 20:50.771
Brought your ride outta here

20:50.945 --> 20:52.903
and your discharge papers.

20:54.818 --> 20:56.864
Pulled some strings,
got you a psych consult

20:57.038 --> 20:58.518
at an eating-disorder clinic
day after tomorrow.

20:58.692 --> 21:01.956
Thanks, but I'm good.

21:02.130 --> 21:03.392
This hospital stay
was the wake-up call I needed.

21:06.700 --> 21:07.831
You don't have to
go through this alone.

21:10.007 --> 21:13.097
Discharge party.
I brought drinks.

21:13.272 --> 21:15.099
Special Potassium Powerhouse
for my big bro.

21:17.537 --> 21:19.756
So, um, Teddy tells me
he has some, like,

21:19.930 --> 21:20.931
freak electrolyte deficiency?

21:22.368 --> 21:23.673
Do you know what caused it?

21:24.979 --> 21:25.458
Teddy's got
all the information.

21:28.069 --> 21:31.202
Do I need to make
any adjustments to his diet?

21:31.377 --> 21:33.335
It might be
a good time to dial back
on the weight-loss goals.

21:33.509 --> 21:34.597
Uh, why?

21:34.771 --> 21:36.512
Simon, uh, let's just go.

21:36.686 --> 21:38.558
Is it dangerous
for him to diet now?

21:38.732 --> 21:40.037
For how long?

21:40.211 --> 21:42.823
Um, I-I-I can't really say.

21:42.997 --> 21:45.173
Simon, forget it.

21:45.347 --> 21:47.131
It's on me
to make sure you're okay.

21:47.306 --> 21:49.917
No, it's actually not.
It's my life.

21:50.091 --> 21:51.527
Why are you
getting mad at me?
I'm just being supportive.

21:51.701 --> 21:53.224
Otherwise known as
micromanaging everything I do.

21:53.399 --> 21:55.966
You were miserable
and a mess, okay?

21:56.140 --> 21:56.967
I'm the one
getting you healthy.

22:01.320 --> 22:02.364
What am I missing?

22:05.019 --> 22:05.715
Tell him.

22:11.852 --> 22:13.723
It wasn't your workouts
that took off the weight.

22:15.508 --> 22:16.552
I've been...

22:17.988 --> 22:18.902
purging.

22:22.732 --> 22:23.907
Making myself puke.

22:32.829 --> 22:34.918
Is that what caused
your heart thing?

22:37.573 --> 22:39.749
Why would you
do something so stupid?

22:39.923 --> 22:42.361
Maybe because
you're so obsessed with me
not being a fat embarrassment.

22:42.535 --> 22:43.710
- I never said that.
- You didn't have to.

22:43.884 --> 22:45.451
You've never been so excited

22:45.625 --> 22:47.278
as when I mentioned
maybe losing some weight.

22:47.453 --> 22:49.237
- Because I'm worried about you?
- You're ashamed of me.

22:50.804 --> 22:52.196
It's been years
since we've hung out,

22:52.371 --> 22:54.285
and now every day,

22:54.460 --> 22:56.244
you're all over me
to meet you at the gym.

22:56.418 --> 22:57.811
You're killing yourself,
but this is my fault?

23:00.291 --> 23:02.424
Get your own ride home.
I don't want to micromanage.

23:05.079 --> 23:05.819
Sim--

23:11.564 --> 23:12.521
Teddy, I am so sorry.

23:12.695 --> 23:13.392
It's fine.

23:15.350 --> 23:16.438
I can Uber.

23:22.618 --> 23:25.491
- You sent her flowers from me?
- You're welcome.

23:25.665 --> 23:27.754
Have you considered
that I may not even
want to keep seeing Lily?

23:27.928 --> 23:30.278
She's clearly a keeper,
and you need a girlfriend.

23:30.452 --> 23:31.975
How is that your business?

23:32.149 --> 23:33.281
Because I need
you and I not to make

23:33.455 --> 23:35.283
the same mistake
all over again.

23:35.457 --> 23:37.154
We both know we've been
teetering on the edge
of falling back into us.

23:37.328 --> 23:38.286
You're out of your mind.

23:38.460 --> 23:39.679
Like you haven't
thought about it?

23:39.853 --> 23:41.071
You read too much
into my friendly gestures.

23:41.245 --> 23:41.985
Like offering me your sperm?

23:42.159 --> 23:44.031
For IVF.

23:44.205 --> 23:45.685
Could the symbolism
be any more heavy-handed?

23:47.687 --> 23:49.036
We can't go back.

23:49.210 --> 23:50.690
You made it very clear
that I'm not what you wanted,

23:50.864 --> 23:52.039
and I haven't changed.

23:52.213 --> 23:52.996
So I need you to move on.

24:05.444 --> 24:07.097
- How long?
- It's just over a minute.

24:07.271 --> 24:08.925
We pushed 2 milligram
IV lorazepam.

24:09.099 --> 24:10.187
And the antibiotics
clearly aren't working.

24:10.361 --> 24:11.624
Push another 2 lorazepam.

24:18.805 --> 24:20.546
Why do you look like
you just watched
the first two minutes of <i>Up?</i>

24:24.724 --> 24:25.681
I thought Teddy
wasn't gonna get

24:25.855 --> 24:27.988
the help he needed
for his bulimia.

24:28.162 --> 24:30.512
I thought maybe
his meddling brother
might make sure he did.

24:31.557 --> 24:33.254
Not a bad plan.

24:33.428 --> 24:36.170
The execution was... flawed.

24:36.344 --> 24:38.041
So congratulations on your
upcoming blowout victory.

24:39.782 --> 24:41.349
Help! Someone call the RRT.

24:41.523 --> 24:43.046
I got it.

24:50.619 --> 24:51.315
Teddy.

24:54.362 --> 24:56.582
He's ruptured his esophagus.
Page Dr. Murphy and prep an OR.

25:12.336 --> 25:13.816
Chest tube placed.

25:13.990 --> 25:15.557
The lung drainage is orange?

25:16.906 --> 25:18.255
What's left of the smoothie.

25:18.429 --> 25:21.302
Advance the endoscope.

25:21.476 --> 25:24.566
He is fortunate
that you responded
so quickly, Dr. Perez.

25:27.743 --> 25:29.571
I pushed Teddy to admit
his bulimia to his brother.

25:31.007 --> 25:33.096
They fought,
and then he did this.

25:34.707 --> 25:36.447
Oh. That was...

25:37.710 --> 25:38.798
not helpful.

25:38.972 --> 25:40.451
And there is too much damage

25:40.626 --> 25:43.498
for a primary
esophageal repair.

25:43.672 --> 25:45.587
We can place
an endoscopic stent,
wait until edema improves.

25:45.761 --> 25:47.284
It will leak.

25:47.458 --> 25:49.548
What about
using omentum as a patch?

25:49.722 --> 25:50.636
The tissue is too friable.

25:53.595 --> 25:55.597
It's usually for kids,
but what about
gastric transposition?

25:57.120 --> 25:58.382
We could resect
the damaged esophagus

25:58.557 --> 25:59.340
and reconstruct it
using stomach tissue.

26:01.516 --> 26:03.431
Good idea, Dr. Perez.

26:03.605 --> 26:05.041
This will improve your score.

26:05.215 --> 26:05.607
We need to open him up.

26:11.091 --> 26:13.267
The abscess is not responding
to the antibiotics.

26:13.441 --> 26:14.964
The sinus infection
is still seeding to the brain.

26:15.138 --> 26:16.531
We could drill
an additional burr hole,

26:16.705 --> 26:18.228
get more aggressive
with the drainage.

26:18.402 --> 26:19.839
The same approach
will get you the same results.

26:20.013 --> 26:21.710
Thanks for
the unhelpful cliche.

26:21.884 --> 26:23.016
Lily needs
a bifrontal craniotomy

26:23.190 --> 26:24.844
with sinus exenteration.

26:25.018 --> 26:26.236
Remove the skull base
on both sides,

26:26.410 --> 26:28.151
then rebuild it
to stop bacterial entry.

26:28.325 --> 26:30.066
I'm not taking off
Lily's forehead
and consigning her

26:30.240 --> 26:31.807
to years
of reconstructive surgeries.

26:31.981 --> 26:33.461
You want to save her life
or protect her pretty face?

26:33.635 --> 26:35.332
Are you seriously accusing me
of acting unethically

26:35.506 --> 26:36.986
because I've been
on two dates with her,

26:37.160 --> 26:38.553
after your move
with the flowers?

26:38.727 --> 26:40.555
- What move with the flowers?
- Shut up.

26:40.729 --> 26:42.426
I'm accusing you
of letting your
medical judgment be clouded

26:42.601 --> 26:43.906
because you don't
want to agree with me.

26:44.080 --> 26:45.952
I'm making the right call
for the patient.

26:46.126 --> 26:47.040
Disagreeing with you
is an unrelated bonus.

26:47.214 --> 26:48.432
Get Lily and the OR prepped.

26:53.394 --> 26:55.962
Removing
the devitalized segment
of the esophagus.

26:57.920 --> 26:59.226
We've got a good plane
of healthy tissue.

27:01.315 --> 27:03.970
Dr. Perez,

27:04.144 --> 27:06.886
you may perform
the two-layered, inverted,
hand-sewn anastomosis.

27:27.428 --> 27:28.472
I had a l-late night
on a research project.

27:29.909 --> 27:30.692
My hands aren't stable enough.

27:33.956 --> 27:34.565
Dr. Powell should take this.

27:43.662 --> 27:44.663
Starting to suture.

27:55.195 --> 27:56.979
I am ready to go home.

27:57.153 --> 27:59.808
I am not,
thanks to Andrews dumping

27:59.982 --> 28:01.984
reconfiguring
the remote interface in my lap.

28:02.158 --> 28:04.073
It's weeks, if not months,
of debugging code.

28:04.247 --> 28:06.249
Well, that was fast.

28:06.423 --> 28:08.904
When I asked Dr. Andrews
to assign you a new project,
he could not think of any.

28:09.078 --> 28:10.253
How is your hand?

28:13.430 --> 28:16.390
Annoy-- Annoyed,
along with the rest of me.
Why would you do that?

28:16.564 --> 28:20.611
Because you have been sad
that we have to wait
to have a baby.

28:20.786 --> 28:23.789
Work will be
a much better distraction
than restoring an old house.

28:26.052 --> 28:28.315
That's not a judgment
for you to make, Shaun.

28:28.489 --> 28:31.100
I'll pick my own distractions.

28:31.274 --> 28:34.060
And I have been sad.

28:35.583 --> 28:37.716
And that house is just a chance

28:37.890 --> 28:39.805
to make something broken
beautiful again.

28:41.850 --> 28:44.374
So is reconfiguring
the remote interface.

28:44.548 --> 28:46.681
The house feels like
a step forward.

28:50.206 --> 28:52.513
I can really see us being happy
in that home, Shaun.

28:52.687 --> 28:55.168
I just wish you would
try to see that, too.

28:59.346 --> 29:00.303
Okay.

29:01.870 --> 29:03.480
Okay we can make an offer?

29:03.654 --> 29:05.874
No, I meant, okay, I will try.

29:08.485 --> 29:09.312
Thanks.

29:11.706 --> 29:13.012
I'll see you at home later.

29:27.504 --> 29:28.592
Sorry I'm late.

29:28.767 --> 29:30.203
I had an impulse.

29:30.377 --> 29:32.509
<i>NBA 2K.</i>

29:32.683 --> 29:34.120
Prepare to get smoked.

29:34.294 --> 29:36.731
Mm. Tip-off will have to wait.
I'm buried.

29:37.688 --> 29:39.255
Maybe I could help?

29:39.429 --> 29:40.039
Trouble with a case?

29:41.388 --> 29:42.345
Yeah.

29:43.607 --> 29:44.347
My own.

29:45.653 --> 29:46.349
What's happened?

29:49.352 --> 29:51.354
Glassman found movement
in my psoas and glutes.

29:53.139 --> 29:56.533
He and Murphy found
an endoscopic solution.

29:56.707 --> 29:58.144
They'll de-tether
your spinal cord.
That's great.

30:01.060 --> 30:02.626
Is there a problem
with the surgical plan?

30:04.019 --> 30:07.414
It's quite elegant.

30:07.588 --> 30:08.371
Then what's holding you back?

30:11.940 --> 30:13.724
I feel like we've been
living in this bubble,

30:13.899 --> 30:15.901
this perfect bubble,

30:18.077 --> 30:19.818
and if I step outside of it,
it will pop.

30:22.298 --> 30:23.125
This surgery...

30:25.258 --> 30:26.085
would change you,

30:28.304 --> 30:29.392
not us.

30:31.873 --> 30:34.136
What we have
isn't going to disappear

30:34.310 --> 30:35.398
if you walk again.

30:38.314 --> 30:39.185
You need to believe that.

30:41.274 --> 30:41.970
I want to.

30:45.234 --> 30:46.627
Please. I can't be the reason
you say no.

30:59.596 --> 31:02.164
We successfully repaired
Teddy's distal esophagus

31:02.338 --> 31:05.124
with reconstructed
stomach tissue.

31:05.298 --> 31:07.343
Teddy will be able to eat
and swallow normally,

31:07.517 --> 31:09.955
but any further purging
will cause irreparable damage.

31:15.525 --> 31:17.440
I thought we were
finally close again.

31:19.268 --> 31:20.313
He's been hurting, and I...

31:23.707 --> 31:24.491
I had no idea.

31:31.759 --> 31:32.716
How do I fix this?

31:35.981 --> 31:39.071
Sometimes... trying to fix
the problem is the problem.

31:42.161 --> 31:44.424
I went through
some tough times, too,

31:44.598 --> 31:48.515
and plenty of people
had ideas about how to fix me.

31:50.865 --> 31:52.475
See, I didn't--
I didn't need that.

31:54.564 --> 31:55.478
I just needed them...

31:57.916 --> 32:03.138
to love me,
broken or not.

32:13.409 --> 32:15.324
Even though
I don't like sanding

32:15.498 --> 32:17.413
and paint is sticky
and smells terrible

32:17.587 --> 32:19.285
and power tools
are loud and dangerous,

32:19.459 --> 32:22.418
I am positive that we,
mostly you,

32:22.592 --> 32:26.422
can make that fixer-upper
into a beautiful home for us

32:26.596 --> 32:27.554
and the family we will have.

32:30.426 --> 32:32.515
Are you saying
we should buy the house?

32:34.996 --> 32:37.520
If it will make you happy.

32:40.219 --> 32:43.048
I bulldozed you, didn't I?

32:43.222 --> 32:45.528
Yes. But I do not mind.

32:47.139 --> 32:47.966
But I do.

32:49.445 --> 32:50.359
I'm being selfish.

32:52.709 --> 32:53.536
Thank you for letting me.

32:59.194 --> 33:02.023
But the only step forward
I need right now

33:02.197 --> 33:03.546
is one we make together.

33:05.461 --> 33:07.072
Let's find a place
we both love.

33:09.988 --> 33:10.945
That is a good approach.

33:14.296 --> 33:15.558
And, also, let's get
my hand checked out.
It does really hurt.

33:19.388 --> 33:20.433
Advancing
into the abscess.

33:21.651 --> 33:23.175
Couldn't stay away?

33:23.349 --> 33:25.090
Lily is my patient.
I admitted her.

33:28.267 --> 33:30.182
Resecting last bits of capsule
from the abscess cavity.

33:33.663 --> 33:34.925
Got it. Pulling the scope.

33:38.233 --> 33:41.106
Heart rate's 32. BP, 210/122.

33:41.280 --> 33:43.717
Her brain
is starting to herniate
out of the burr holes.

33:43.891 --> 33:45.762
Give 100 grams mannitol,
burst suppress
high-dose propofol.

33:45.936 --> 33:47.242
That won't be enough.
Get her CO2 below 30.

33:47.416 --> 33:49.157
I'm aware.
Place an EVD.

33:49.331 --> 33:51.986
- Should we pivot to
the bifrontal craniotomy?
- No time.

33:52.160 --> 33:54.902
Can you connect
the burr holes and run
a small craniotomy flap?

33:55.076 --> 33:57.687
No, but a hemicraniectomy
will reduce the brain pressure.

33:57.861 --> 33:59.298
And then you can debride
the skull-base infection.

33:59.472 --> 34:00.908
- Good.
- Good.

34:02.779 --> 34:03.867
Mm, that was hot.

34:13.094 --> 34:16.489
Doing this surgery
is a good decision.

34:17.707 --> 34:19.448
- I hope so.
- Doubts?

34:21.146 --> 34:23.626
No. I'm a little nervous,
but no doubts.

34:27.021 --> 34:29.110
Thank you both
for not giving up.

34:32.331 --> 34:33.158
You're welcome.

34:36.335 --> 34:37.466
We'll see you in recovery.

34:45.735 --> 34:46.432
Welcome back.

34:49.087 --> 34:49.652
You've got a visitor.

34:57.530 --> 34:58.531
You're okay?

35:01.403 --> 35:03.188
Getting there.

35:03.362 --> 35:05.451
No gym for a while.
You need time to heal.

35:07.105 --> 35:07.888
I'm on it, doc.

35:13.807 --> 35:14.895
Remember when we were kids,

35:16.897 --> 35:17.941
you made me watch
<i>Alien vs. Predator?</i>

35:21.684 --> 35:23.164
I had to let you sleep
in my room for three months.

35:26.472 --> 35:29.779
Turns out the combined
<i>Alien/Predator</i> canon
includes 13 movies.

35:31.955 --> 35:32.695
You and I are gonna
watch them together.

35:35.524 --> 35:36.699
If that's cool with you.

35:39.920 --> 35:40.703
Sounds stupid.

35:43.706 --> 35:44.925
But fun.

36:05.337 --> 36:07.382
Looks like both brothers
are on the mend.

36:07.556 --> 36:09.384
Take video. Maybe Murphy
will give you some points.

36:09.558 --> 36:11.604
I'm good.

36:15.521 --> 36:18.132
What happened in the OR
when you handed over
the anastomosis?

36:20.395 --> 36:21.222
Just didn't feel like my day.

36:25.444 --> 36:28.751
I devised
my first-year-resident
rating system

36:28.925 --> 36:30.927
as a distraction.

36:31.101 --> 36:33.887
It was very complicated
and encouraged
too much competition.

36:34.061 --> 36:36.019
So I have decided to retire it.

37:01.915 --> 37:02.785
You okay?

37:06.485 --> 37:09.009
Easily the worst date
I've ever been on.

37:09.183 --> 37:10.880
Well, the next one,
I'll put the rest
of your skull back on.

37:13.492 --> 37:15.407
We have to wait until
the swelling in your brain
has gone down.

37:20.238 --> 37:21.064
Am I gonna be okay?

37:23.241 --> 37:25.330
You've got a long road ahead,
but yes.

37:27.245 --> 37:29.290
And you won't be alone.

37:33.947 --> 37:35.383
That's a lot of commitment...

37:38.430 --> 37:40.823
especially when you
and Dr. Reznick
don't really seem done.

37:46.873 --> 37:48.614
Thanks for everything...

37:50.442 --> 37:51.443
Dr. Park.

38:00.539 --> 38:01.322
I'm glad you didn't move on...

38:03.672 --> 38:04.412
from the case.

38:06.719 --> 38:07.720
Glad you listened.

38:07.894 --> 38:08.851
I'm working on it.

38:11.854 --> 38:14.857
Lily will be lucky to have you
through her recovery,

38:15.031 --> 38:16.424
unless you decided
not to see her anymore.

38:19.427 --> 38:21.255
You were right. She's a keeper.

38:24.127 --> 38:24.867
Then I'm happy for you two.

38:36.923 --> 38:38.751
Visiting hours still open?

38:38.925 --> 38:41.406
They don't usually
let visitors into pre-op.

38:41.580 --> 38:42.885
Well, nobody says no
to a guy in a wheelchair.

38:43.843 --> 38:46.236
I had to see you.

38:46.411 --> 38:52.460
I recognize
this is terrible timing
and kind of bonkers,

38:52.634 --> 38:54.201
but I couldn't let you
go in before asking.

38:57.770 --> 38:58.640
Audrey...

39:03.863 --> 39:05.125
will you marry me?

39:12.306 --> 39:12.915
<i>Definitely</i> bonkers.

39:14.264 --> 39:15.918
I don't expect an answer now.

39:19.357 --> 39:22.534
This?
This is me telling you
that I am all in.

39:30.716 --> 39:31.412
Thank you.
