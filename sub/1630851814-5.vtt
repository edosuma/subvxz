00:50.925 --> 00:52.761
THE FIRE CATHEDRAL SCENE
FROM THE PREVIOUS EPISODE

00:52.844 --> 00:54.429
WAS NEVER INTENDED TO PORTRAY
A PARTICULAR CHARACTER AS EVIL

00:54.512 --> 00:56.097
WE APOLOGIZE TO OUR VIEWERS
AND OUR FIRE RESCUE TEAM

00:56.181 --> 00:57.849
WHO MAY HAVE FELT
UNCOMFORTABLE FROM THE SCENE

00:58.850 --> 01:01.394
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION
BASED IN A DYSTOPIAN KOREA

01:01.478 --> 01:04.105
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS
AND EVENTS ARE FICTITIOUS

02:47.917 --> 02:49.294
Did you have a nightmare?

02:53.548 --> 02:55.216
You don't look so good.

02:56.968 --> 02:58.261
Are you all right?

02:58.344 --> 03:00.013
Don't touch me.

03:00.096 --> 03:01.431
What is it?

03:01.514 --> 03:03.224
What are you two doing?

03:03.892 --> 03:05.602
What do you want?

03:05.685 --> 03:08.146
Oh, am I interrupting you?

03:10.648 --> 03:11.858
What are you doing here?

03:13.735 --> 03:17.155
I came to talk to you about something,
but I better come back another time.

03:17.238 --> 03:18.698
You don't look very well.

03:27.415 --> 03:28.583
What was that just now?

03:29.292 --> 03:30.209
What?

03:30.877 --> 03:32.086
When you woke up.

03:32.754 --> 03:35.381
Why were you so startled?
It wasn't like you, Yo-han.

03:35.465 --> 03:38.843
-You looked completely flustered.
-What is it that you want to say?

03:39.719 --> 03:43.556
It's as if you'd seen the face
of someone you'd killed.

03:46.059 --> 03:49.145
I couldn't care less about those I killed.

03:50.980 --> 03:52.523
If I really killed them, that is.

04:13.211 --> 04:14.337
Judge Kang.

04:16.547 --> 04:18.132
I'm truly sorry about yesterday.

04:18.216 --> 04:21.427
I have no excuses even if you kick me out
from the department.

04:22.095 --> 04:23.221
Kick you out?

04:23.888 --> 04:25.723
To suggest you killed your brother

04:26.599 --> 04:28.101
when you suffered such pain…

04:30.561 --> 04:31.729
I truly apologize.

04:33.189 --> 04:36.150
<i>ETHOLOGY</i>

04:46.995 --> 04:48.288
Of course.

04:49.998 --> 04:52.500
I wouldn't want to hear it from this face.

04:59.549 --> 05:01.551
It's hard seeing my face, isn't it?

05:03.344 --> 05:04.929
I'll leave the department.

05:05.013 --> 05:06.889
No need to apologize for a coincidence.

05:06.973 --> 05:10.768
That face of yours that resembles him…
It's just a coincidence, isn't it?

05:13.021 --> 05:14.063
But that's not all.

05:14.147 --> 05:16.524
-That's not all?
-I'm sure you know it already.

05:16.607 --> 05:20.320
That I'd been doubting you
and trailing you.

05:23.573 --> 05:26.034
I'm curious to know
how much you've discovered.

05:26.909 --> 05:28.619
That this was a long-prepared hunt.

05:29.287 --> 05:31.331
A long-prepared hunt?

05:31.414 --> 05:33.708
I looked over all of
your past trial records.

05:33.791 --> 05:36.210
In the past, you'd ruled as per the custom

05:36.878 --> 05:38.880
like a machine, without ever standing out.

05:38.963 --> 05:41.549
But then again, the hunter thoroughly
disguises his scent.

05:42.633 --> 05:44.719
Until the right day comes.

05:48.473 --> 05:52.101
I honestly don't understand
why I did such a thing that day.

05:52.185 --> 05:56.105
We had our son very late,
and he's as precious as my own life…

05:58.316 --> 06:01.110
Because of that damned liquor,
before I realized it…

06:01.194 --> 06:04.906
Do you call that an excuse
after almost beating him to death?

06:06.532 --> 06:08.242
Please kill me, Your Honor.

06:08.326 --> 06:11.662
After being fired from my job and
having to move here and there,

06:11.746 --> 06:14.290
the weight of life became unbearable
because of money.

06:14.373 --> 06:16.751
I must have lost my wits.

06:16.834 --> 06:18.586
But this wasn't your first time.

06:19.253 --> 06:22.882
The Defendant has been habitually abusing
his wife and young son.

06:23.549 --> 06:26.302
-He must be severely punished.
-I'm sorry, Your Honor!

06:26.385 --> 06:28.554
Please have mercy on me, just this once.

06:28.638 --> 06:30.848
I know I deserve to die for what I did.

06:30.932 --> 06:34.727
But I won't ever… ever lay
a finger on my child again.

06:34.811 --> 06:36.604
If you'll forgive me just this once,

06:36.687 --> 06:39.398
I'll be a better man.

06:39.482 --> 06:43.236
So please forgive me. Please, Your Honor!

06:43.319 --> 06:45.988
I'm really sorry.
If you'll forgive me just this once,

06:46.072 --> 06:48.950
I won't ever lay a finger on them again!

06:49.033 --> 06:50.243
Please, Your Honor…

07:08.845 --> 07:09.971
<i>Given how the victim,</i>

07:10.054 --> 07:12.265
the Defendant's family,
has been imploring for leniency,

07:13.224 --> 07:16.769
and how the Defendant had been completely
inebriated at the time of his act,

07:16.853 --> 07:20.314
this court grants you to
a stay of execution.

07:21.649 --> 07:22.567
Your Honor!

07:35.246 --> 07:38.458
But just one puzzled me. Your motive.

07:38.541 --> 07:40.418
I just couldn't understand it at all.

07:40.501 --> 07:42.712
-I'm sure.
-However…

07:43.504 --> 07:44.338
Anger.

07:46.340 --> 07:47.425
That, I understand.

07:48.092 --> 07:49.218
You understand?

07:49.302 --> 07:52.388
Even if no one else
in this world does, I do.

07:53.055 --> 07:54.432
I understand that feeling.

07:58.060 --> 07:59.937
But what's no is a no.

08:00.021 --> 08:03.399
It's a crime to use trials as a tool.

08:03.483 --> 08:04.942
How amusing.

08:06.694 --> 08:08.988
I don't ever recall
begging you to understand me.

08:12.200 --> 08:15.036
In fact, I don't need your understanding.
So make your choice.

08:16.162 --> 08:19.707
Will you stand in my way or stand with me?

08:21.000 --> 08:24.545
For your reference,
I have no hesitation in removing

08:24.629 --> 08:25.838
whatever stands in my way.

08:28.090 --> 08:29.509
I'm very much aware of that.

08:31.385 --> 08:32.553
Then you may go.

08:39.727 --> 08:41.062
I won't kick you out.

08:41.687 --> 08:43.397
I'll see you back at the department.

08:44.982 --> 08:47.193
It's rather fun, having you around.

09:02.625 --> 09:04.168
It's as I predicted, but…

09:09.215 --> 09:11.175
But why are you like that?

09:11.259 --> 09:12.343
Well…

09:13.219 --> 09:15.471
After being showered with understanding,

09:15.555 --> 09:17.431
I was a little thrown off.

09:17.515 --> 09:19.600
I've never really had such an experience.

09:21.143 --> 09:24.355
Before that, how are the developments
on Cha Gyeong-hui's end?

09:33.406 --> 09:34.532
Look, lady!

09:38.119 --> 09:40.746
You can't just come and go
as you wish here.

09:40.830 --> 09:41.872
Get out already.

09:42.540 --> 09:44.584
Hurry up. What do you think you're doing?

09:49.088 --> 09:50.214
Minister Cha.

09:53.050 --> 09:57.305
Well, the execution is still not over,
so we can't accept visitors, even family.

09:57.388 --> 09:59.432
Park Young-jin,
Correctional Officer Grade 9.

10:01.642 --> 10:02.685
Yes?

10:03.352 --> 10:05.605
Have you ever seen
your organizational chart?

10:05.688 --> 10:06.856
Pardon?

10:08.024 --> 10:10.401
The official in charge here
is the Warden, isn't he?

10:10.484 --> 10:12.862
Above him is the Commissioner of the RCH

10:12.945 --> 10:15.906
who manages the facilities in the region.
And above him is

10:15.990 --> 10:19.744
the Commissioner of KCS,
who oversees all the RCH in the country.

10:20.411 --> 10:21.787
Yes, I'm aware of that.

10:21.871 --> 10:25.333
And it's me who gives orders
to the Commissioner of KCS.

10:25.916 --> 10:28.044
I'm here today
as the chief commissioner of

10:28.127 --> 10:31.297
Korea's corrections administration,
and not the family of a convict.

10:31.380 --> 10:32.340
So move.

12:00.511 --> 12:03.431
Take good care of him until
his execution is carried out in full.

12:03.514 --> 12:04.640
Yes, Minister.

12:29.957 --> 12:32.251
It's rare to see you cook.

12:33.252 --> 12:34.920
Because we have a guest with us.

12:35.004 --> 12:36.088
Guest…

12:37.006 --> 12:40.426
-Oh, but I'm…
-Although you're an uninvited guest.

12:41.719 --> 12:42.928
Yes.

12:43.012 --> 12:44.930
By the way, are you okay with Korean?

12:45.014 --> 12:47.266
I only know how to cook Korean cuisine.

12:47.349 --> 12:48.684
I love Korean cuisine.

12:49.685 --> 12:51.520
What are you doing here?

12:52.188 --> 12:55.649
I'm sorry, Master.
But since we have a guest, I thought--

12:55.733 --> 12:58.110
I told you not to stay
in this house after sunset.

13:01.071 --> 13:02.156
I apologize.

13:08.412 --> 13:09.455
Ma'am.

13:13.042 --> 13:14.210
Ma'am!

13:16.712 --> 13:19.256
You went out of your way for him.
What was that reaction?

13:20.424 --> 13:23.177
He probably thinks
I'll poison the food or something.

13:23.260 --> 13:25.846
He's scared, after what he's done.

13:25.930 --> 13:28.265
Do you really think it was Judge Kang?

13:28.349 --> 13:30.226
The child you nurtured?

13:31.393 --> 13:33.771
Deep down,
you don't want to believe it too, right?

13:36.857 --> 13:39.527
I'm sorry, but please throw the food out.

13:39.610 --> 13:40.945
It'll spoil.

13:46.867 --> 13:48.118
Darn it.

13:48.911 --> 13:50.871
Do you really have to do this
at the Blue House?

13:50.955 --> 13:52.248
Hey, stay quiet if you know nothing.

13:52.331 --> 13:55.251
Because of Kang Yo-han,
our presence is zero.

13:55.334 --> 13:56.669
We need to do something.

13:57.503 --> 14:00.214
Wow, this still works
after all that time in storage.

14:00.297 --> 14:01.590
Step out for a moment.

14:03.133 --> 14:04.176
Hello!

14:05.553 --> 14:08.681
I'm the man to change Korea totally,

14:08.764 --> 14:13.435
Heo Joong-se! Yes, the man
to solve all your woes!

14:13.519 --> 14:16.272
So, where am I today?
I'm sure you know it already.

14:17.022 --> 14:18.732
I'm at the presidential residence.

14:18.816 --> 14:21.277
For the first time in Korea's history,

14:21.360 --> 14:24.738
I'm giving you an exclusive tour
around the Blue House!

14:24.822 --> 14:28.075
So stay tuned, and…

14:28.158 --> 14:29.243
follow me!

14:31.704 --> 14:36.876
I always believe myself to be
a mere servant of my fellow Koreans

14:36.959 --> 14:39.420
whom I deeply respect.

14:39.503 --> 14:41.672
Don't I look like
I'll make a good servant?

14:41.755 --> 14:43.716
My lady!

14:45.217 --> 14:48.053
It's been a long time, everyone.
How have you been?

14:50.389 --> 14:51.765
Thank you!

14:51.849 --> 14:54.768
"Look at her beauty! Timeless, classic…"

14:55.603 --> 14:57.730
It's all thanks to your love and support.

14:57.813 --> 15:01.442
Please join us celebrity couple now
for a tour around the Blue House!

15:02.318 --> 15:05.070
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

15:05.154 --> 15:06.322
So, what do you think?

15:06.405 --> 15:08.949
Isn't it interesting
seeing the Blue House for yourself?

15:09.033 --> 15:10.701
I was in awe at first too.

15:10.784 --> 15:13.037
Same here, at first.

15:13.120 --> 15:15.414
-But it turns out it's all the same.
-Right.

15:15.497 --> 15:19.251
By the way, there was a recent proposal
to renovate the Blue House

15:19.335 --> 15:22.463
and I told off the secretary
big time for even mentioning that to me.

15:22.546 --> 15:24.256
After all, that's all the taxes.

15:24.340 --> 15:26.300
Your hard-earned money, right?

15:26.383 --> 15:28.844
In fact, why don't we move to
a smaller residence

15:29.678 --> 15:32.264
and turn this into welfare…

15:33.724 --> 15:35.726
Wow, that's so admirable!

15:36.435 --> 15:39.146
Anyway, this is something…

15:40.439 --> 15:43.525
I'm considering.
And which I will continue to consider.

15:43.609 --> 15:46.195
-Yes.
-We have so many in need.

15:46.278 --> 15:48.656
This here is my favorite place.

15:49.406 --> 15:51.951
My long-time hobby
has been woodcraft, you see.

15:52.034 --> 15:53.243
She's an artist.

15:54.370 --> 15:56.997
In fact, I received an offer
from a curator at a gallery

15:57.081 --> 15:58.666
to hold an exhibition.

16:01.627 --> 16:04.755
I really regret to say this,
but the cabinet meeting is starting soon

16:04.838 --> 16:07.508
so we'll have to end it here today.
Shall we all shout it out in a long time?

16:07.591 --> 16:09.593
The man to change Korea totally,

16:09.677 --> 16:13.138
Heo Joong-se!
Yes, the man to solve all your woes!

16:13.222 --> 16:16.016
Well, goodbye everyone!

16:20.062 --> 16:21.271
Hey.

16:21.772 --> 16:22.856
Hey!

16:23.983 --> 16:27.194
Why did you have to mention
your private exhibition there?

16:27.945 --> 16:31.824
I'm the first lady of this country.
Is there any problem with that?

16:35.160 --> 16:38.455
<i>Still, I understand
how you must feel as a mother.</i>

16:40.082 --> 16:42.918
<i>No, before I am a mother,</i>

16:43.002 --> 16:46.046
<i>I'm someone with the responsibility
of restoring justice.</i>

16:46.130 --> 16:49.842
I'm simply fulfilling my given role
making no exceptions.

16:52.011 --> 16:54.555
Where else will we find
a public official like her?

16:54.638 --> 16:58.100
Please give a big hand to
Minister Cha Gyeong-hui once again.

17:00.728 --> 17:02.771
-Thank you.
-We love you.

17:04.064 --> 17:07.026
We'll be back after the commercials.

17:08.277 --> 17:10.237
Thank you, you should get some rest.

17:10.320 --> 17:11.321
Yes.

17:11.905 --> 17:13.490
-Let me take a break, then.
-Sure.

17:17.536 --> 17:21.081
You are truly amazing,
turning a crisis into an opportunity.

17:22.082 --> 17:24.835
With the foundation
just sitting back and watching,

17:24.918 --> 17:27.296
I need to survive through this
using my own means.

17:27.379 --> 17:29.173
But from what I've seen,

17:29.256 --> 17:32.051
I thought your tactics would be offense
rather than defense.

17:34.720 --> 17:36.805
You look as if
you have something prepared.

17:37.514 --> 17:38.766
As I thought.

17:39.516 --> 17:42.895
You should head back.
The show isn't over yet.

17:59.119 --> 18:01.246
<i>I don't know how to bring this up to you,</i>

18:01.330 --> 18:05.584
but many have raised their concerns
about this recent flogging case.

18:06.752 --> 18:08.587
Here's a photo we've managed to acquire.

18:20.224 --> 18:23.602
Many are starting to question
whether this is too harsh,

18:23.685 --> 18:27.189
and too barbarian
when we're in the 21st Century.

18:29.775 --> 18:31.026
No.

18:31.110 --> 18:33.237
This is the punishment
he rightfully deserves.

18:37.991 --> 18:39.785
I'm sorry.

18:40.869 --> 18:42.246
I really am.

18:43.705 --> 18:46.333
And despite it being an official trial,

18:46.416 --> 18:49.086
there were some inhumane scenes.

18:49.753 --> 18:51.630
<i>As this is a punishment by our people,</i>

18:51.713 --> 18:54.133
<i>it is right that
the sentence be carried out publicly</i>

18:54.216 --> 18:57.302
<i>and transparently
for the entire nation to watch.</i>

18:57.386 --> 19:00.722
<i>I urge the Ministry of Justice to
take note before executing the sentence.</i>

19:01.640 --> 19:04.726
Those were the words
from Judge Kang during the trial.

19:04.810 --> 19:07.980
And this scene has become
quite controversial.

19:08.063 --> 19:10.399
I'd like to ask our viewers.
What are your thoughts?

19:14.027 --> 19:17.030
-Are you all right?
-I'm fine.

19:17.739 --> 19:20.284
<i>-Do you think you can continue?
-Yes.</i>

19:20.367 --> 19:22.744
<i>-I'm truly sorry.
-It's okay.</i>

19:23.412 --> 19:25.789
"The public is fickle."

19:27.666 --> 19:28.709
Impressive.

19:33.589 --> 19:36.091
I need to find out
who's behind Cha Gyeong-hui.

19:45.225 --> 19:46.727
Kim Ga-on!

19:46.810 --> 19:48.645
Oh gosh!

19:49.688 --> 19:50.981
I'm still recovering.

19:51.648 --> 19:52.774
Are you? Sorry.

19:52.858 --> 19:55.652
Hey! Do you know
how worried I was about you?

19:55.736 --> 19:58.113
-Thank you.
-But it's not just me.

19:58.197 --> 19:59.531
Ta-da! Take a look.

20:00.490 --> 20:01.700
What is all this?

20:01.783 --> 20:03.952
Just accept it.
You're like a K-Pop idol now.

20:04.036 --> 20:07.539
-I appreciate all this, but…
-Hey.

20:08.624 --> 20:11.793
Being overmodest is
no different from arrogance.

20:11.877 --> 20:14.588
People who were born
to draw attention like us

20:14.671 --> 20:16.965
always need to live
with a sense of responsibility.

20:18.091 --> 20:19.426
Exactly.

20:19.509 --> 20:21.470
A sense of responsibility as star judges!

20:22.137 --> 20:23.472
Hello, Producer.

20:23.555 --> 20:24.765
Congratulations!

20:25.349 --> 20:29.519
You just shine by simply standing there,
yet you had to throw yourself

20:29.603 --> 20:32.981
to save your colleague
from a shocking terrorist attack.

20:33.065 --> 20:36.526
Then after being in a coma,
you make a miraculous return to the court.

20:37.361 --> 20:40.197
Honestly, I was so overwhelmed
by your special documentary

20:40.280 --> 20:42.115
on Judge Kim's safe return.

20:42.199 --> 20:44.409
Safe return?
My condition wasn't that critical.

20:44.493 --> 20:47.162
Don't get so hung up
on the little details.

20:47.246 --> 20:50.249
The direr the crisis a hero is in,
the better.

20:50.332 --> 20:53.585
As I expected from Judge Oh!
She knows what storytelling is.

20:53.669 --> 20:54.711
You were just born with it!

20:55.921 --> 20:56.880
Maestro!

20:56.964 --> 20:58.006
Diva.

20:59.383 --> 21:02.469
Will I ever receive another chance
to produce something like this?

21:02.552 --> 21:05.097
That's why I'm going to risk my all,
filming this.

21:05.180 --> 21:06.723
So hang in there, Judges!

21:06.807 --> 21:08.058
Cheers to us!

21:08.141 --> 21:10.769
-Please take good care of yourself.
-Yes, thank you.

21:11.895 --> 21:13.480
-Producer.
-Yes?

21:13.563 --> 21:16.733
-But will it be okay?
-What?

21:17.567 --> 21:19.528
Oh, the morning talk show?

21:20.529 --> 21:22.948
Minister Cha just had to show tears…

21:23.031 --> 21:25.867
No need to worry, however!

21:25.951 --> 21:29.621
We need some controversy
at the start for success.

21:29.705 --> 21:32.082
-"Noise marketing."
-What are you talking about?

21:33.875 --> 21:36.628
Nothing. Get some rest.
You're still recovering.

21:39.423 --> 21:42.884
So, about flogging…
Does it result in such serious injuries?

21:42.968 --> 21:46.972
Who knows. Execution of the order is under
the Ministry of Justice's jurisdiction.

22:23.508 --> 22:24.718
Hey, Ga-on.

22:24.801 --> 22:26.053
<i>Su-hyeon.</i>

22:26.136 --> 22:28.847
-How about dinner tonight?
<i>-Sure.</i>

22:28.930 --> 22:30.849
You have free time for a change.

22:31.516 --> 22:34.728
-I'll pick the menu then.
<i>-Sure.</i>

22:46.531 --> 22:47.783
We're from the WAIS.

23:48.969 --> 23:51.304
Judge Kang Yo-han
is leaving his office now.

24:02.107 --> 24:05.026
I rounded up all of our friends
at the Prosecutors' Office,

24:05.110 --> 24:08.280
but failed to find out
who is behind Cha Gyeong-hui.

24:08.363 --> 24:11.533
-Is that so?
-Perhaps this is all her own doing.

24:12.659 --> 24:16.746
Manipulate the photos of flogging injuries
and air them…

24:19.624 --> 24:22.169
Cha Gyeong-hui's not someone
to put on a show like that.

24:22.252 --> 24:24.379
She's not someone to leave trails behind.

24:25.714 --> 24:27.174
Let me look into it some more.

24:28.049 --> 24:29.759
Let's strike the body first.

24:30.886 --> 24:32.554
The foundation's Dream Base project.

24:33.263 --> 24:37.309
-Did you find anyone with connections?
-Yes, we managed to secure one.

24:38.393 --> 24:40.854
The same place as last time,
at four o'clock, Saturday.

24:40.937 --> 24:42.439
Yes, sir.

25:30.028 --> 25:33.365
<i>Master, you have a message
from Master Ga-on.</i>

25:33.448 --> 25:34.658
A message?

25:35.408 --> 25:37.619
<i>Just heat up the rice and stew.</i>

25:37.702 --> 25:39.246
<i>Make sure you finish everything.</i>

25:39.955 --> 25:42.666
<i>That way, you'll get a good night's sleep.</i>

25:44.542 --> 25:48.129
<i>You'll add more wrinkles
if you skip your meals.</i>

25:48.213 --> 25:50.548
<i>It's time you start
worrying about your age.</i>

25:50.632 --> 25:52.008
I don't have wrinkles…

25:52.092 --> 25:54.511
<i>Wrinkles. The phenomenon of skin creasing</i>

25:54.594 --> 25:57.514
<i>due to reduced elasticity in ageing skin.</i>

26:00.058 --> 26:01.518
Wait. "Master Ga-on?"

26:01.601 --> 26:03.645
Since when did you have another master?

26:04.521 --> 26:06.523
So now you'll pick your own master?

26:06.606 --> 26:08.650
I don't remember the manual
mentioning such function.

26:11.528 --> 26:13.905
There you go again,
pretending to be asleep.

26:13.989 --> 26:15.615
Pretending to be asleep.

27:16.384 --> 27:17.677
That was good.

27:28.480 --> 27:31.107
Detective Park, I believe
we're not done yet.

27:31.941 --> 27:34.110
About the source of
your hefty severance pay.

27:35.028 --> 27:37.947
-Get lost. I have nothing to tell you.
-I already looked into it.

27:38.031 --> 27:41.201
Your gambling debt and the money
that went into opening this place

27:41.284 --> 27:42.535
amounts to over a billion.

27:42.619 --> 27:45.497
Since when did the police receive
such generous severance pay?

27:45.580 --> 27:46.748
How about I take a guess?

27:47.957 --> 27:50.210
How much did Kang Yo-han
pay you for covering--

27:50.293 --> 27:51.628
No, let me guess.

27:55.131 --> 27:58.051
How much did you receive
from the foundation?

27:59.010 --> 28:00.136
It was the foundation?

28:53.732 --> 28:55.483
What did you find out, Ga-on?

29:00.155 --> 29:01.948
What a gruesome story.

29:02.449 --> 29:04.200
But how are we supposed to believe it?

29:04.284 --> 29:06.286
They're just one-sided claims
by Kang Yo-han.

29:07.036 --> 29:09.247
You're right,
and that's why I came to check.

29:09.330 --> 29:12.000
Actually, there's something
that had been bothering me too.

29:12.709 --> 29:13.877
What?

29:13.960 --> 29:16.421
The list of the attendees at the scene
of the fire was never revealed.

29:16.504 --> 29:19.841
That's not something Kang Yo-han
could have done ten years ago.

29:19.924 --> 29:22.761
It would've required shutting up
the prosecution and the media.

29:22.844 --> 29:26.765
-You're right.
-Even so, why did he nullify the MoU?

29:26.848 --> 29:28.683
Wasn't he after his brother's wealth?

29:28.767 --> 29:32.187
Maybe, yes.
But if what Kang Yo-han said was true,

29:32.854 --> 29:36.065
I would have nullified it
to stop the donation.

29:40.779 --> 29:43.740
Anyway, what's for sure is that

29:44.699 --> 29:47.994
Kang Yo-han, that man, is
scheming something dangerous.

29:48.077 --> 29:50.955
I'll take this case,
so you keep some distance from him.

29:53.750 --> 29:55.794
-It's like the old times.
-What?

29:59.005 --> 30:01.049
<i>I told you Ga-on, didn't I?
They're dangerous.</i>

30:07.680 --> 30:10.308
Your face is a mess right now.

30:20.318 --> 30:23.154
Let's stop doing this to your face, Ga-on.

30:27.283 --> 30:29.494
You'll get into serious trouble
at this rate.

30:38.294 --> 30:42.090
Think about your parents
who are in heaven, Ga-on.

30:43.550 --> 30:46.177
They will be grieving to
see you hurt like this.

30:52.976 --> 30:54.018
Su-hyeon.

31:10.368 --> 31:12.287
<i>I'll be careful, so don't worry.</i>

31:17.333 --> 31:19.043
And don't you be deluded.

31:20.128 --> 31:21.129
Deluded?

31:21.212 --> 31:23.798
Whether Kang Yo-han has a reason or not,

31:24.591 --> 31:26.426
that still doesn't change anything.

31:26.509 --> 31:28.177
Who out there doesn't have
a story to tell?

31:28.261 --> 31:31.556
And it's not like everyone
breaks the law, is it?

31:33.600 --> 31:34.517
That's true.

31:36.394 --> 31:39.522
-You sure are a great police officer.
-Great? Please.

31:41.274 --> 31:42.775
Your grades have improved again.

31:44.110 --> 31:45.987
This is superb, Su-hyeon.

31:46.070 --> 31:48.114
You'll have no trouble getting
into the Police University.

31:48.197 --> 31:50.033
-Really, ma'am?
-Of course.

31:50.867 --> 31:53.870
But Su-hyeon,
does it have to be the Police University?

31:54.579 --> 31:57.415
With your grades,
I think you can do anything.

31:57.498 --> 31:59.375
Ma'am, I have to go there no matter what.

31:59.459 --> 32:01.544
Why? You want to be
the Police Commissioner?

32:01.628 --> 32:02.670
No.

32:03.880 --> 32:04.964
Then what?

32:07.050 --> 32:09.510
There's someone I want to excuse so badly.

32:10.303 --> 32:11.387
Excuse?

32:13.640 --> 32:16.517
There's someone I know
who's always getting into trouble,

32:16.601 --> 32:19.187
and I want to do what I can to spare him.

32:22.982 --> 32:24.734
I'm not a great officer as you think.

32:24.817 --> 32:26.736
Fine, then you're a bad officer.

32:32.241 --> 32:33.952
-Su-hyeon.
-Yes?

32:34.619 --> 32:36.788
Please be a bad officer, just this once.

32:37.455 --> 32:40.249
Things have gone out of hand.
The major media companies,

32:40.333 --> 32:42.043
the Minister of Justice,
and even the President too…

32:42.126 --> 32:43.795
You saw that detective just now too.

32:44.337 --> 32:47.256
I'm scared that
something might happen to you.

32:48.132 --> 32:50.551
So can't we just be the bad cowards?

32:51.636 --> 32:54.389
I think it's too late for that already.

32:58.726 --> 33:01.187
For the upcoming trial,
we're thinking of this.

33:01.813 --> 33:03.064
Let's go with another case.

33:03.731 --> 33:04.857
Another case?

33:04.941 --> 33:08.361
There is a case
the prosecution is insisting on.

33:09.862 --> 33:10.822
Are they?

33:11.447 --> 33:15.118
It's not to our benefit to
put just one office under the spotlight.

33:15.785 --> 33:17.161
Let's give them a chance too.

33:17.245 --> 33:19.455
From now on, the case nomination
for the <i>Live Court Show</i>

33:19.539 --> 33:21.332
will be done through our screening.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.836
-Just letting you know now.
-We're only just getting started.

33:24.919 --> 33:26.921
Isn't it best to focus
on drawing attention?

33:27.005 --> 33:28.965
Social rest always comes first.

33:29.716 --> 33:31.801
If you won't agree,

33:33.136 --> 33:37.223
we have other excellent judges
in our judiciary,

33:37.306 --> 33:39.767
even if they're not as excellent as you.

33:41.602 --> 33:42.937
Is that right?

33:44.897 --> 33:48.192
Don't forget who has
personnel authority, Judge Kang.

33:52.572 --> 33:53.906
I'll remember that.

33:55.199 --> 33:57.493
And I see you haven't forgotten who has

33:57.577 --> 33:59.579
personnel authority over you,
Chief Justice.

34:01.122 --> 34:02.248
Judge Kang!

34:12.467 --> 34:13.718
Fellow Koreans.

34:13.801 --> 34:18.806
Please greet our judges for today's trial
with a big round of applause!

34:18.890 --> 34:20.725
YOU WILL BE THE ONE TO JUDGE

34:27.356 --> 34:30.985
Today we're joined by Judge Kim Ga-on,

34:31.819 --> 34:34.989
who has braved through death
to come back to us.

34:42.080 --> 34:44.248
We love you, Judge Kim!

34:44.332 --> 34:46.709
KIM GA-ON IS OUR IDOL!

34:46.793 --> 34:47.877
HANDSOME KIM GA-ON

34:47.960 --> 34:48.961
GA-ON, I REJECT IT!

34:53.216 --> 34:55.843
Please don't be surprised.
Our defendant today is…

34:56.427 --> 35:00.223
Nam Seok-hoon, Korea's favorite actor.

35:02.850 --> 35:05.019
DEFENDANT

35:10.149 --> 35:12.235
<i>A celebrity, instead of a power figure?</i>

35:14.779 --> 35:17.740
We, the Prosecution,
will uproot sexual abuse

35:17.824 --> 35:20.368
that's rampant in the film
and the broadcasting industry.

35:20.451 --> 35:21.786
On behalf of our people,

35:21.869 --> 35:25.873
we indict the Defendant, Nam Seok-hoon,
with charges of habitual sexual assault.

35:27.917 --> 35:32.046
An extra, stylist, and supporting act.

35:32.130 --> 35:35.091
Three cases of sexual assault
and two indecent assaults.

35:35.174 --> 35:36.175
Mr. Nam?

35:37.635 --> 35:39.512
Do you admit to the charges
made by the Prosecution?

35:45.810 --> 35:46.853
I do, Your Honor.

36:04.078 --> 36:05.204
<i>I plead innocence.</i>

36:09.709 --> 36:12.503
I may have made a few mistakes
while drunk,

36:13.171 --> 36:14.380
but sexual assault?

36:15.882 --> 36:17.383
Mistake, you say?

36:17.466 --> 36:18.634
<i>Hello, Mr. Nam.</i>

36:20.511 --> 36:22.597
You should come
if your mentor's calling you.

36:22.680 --> 36:25.766
We need to go through
our lines together, don't we?

36:25.850 --> 36:29.478
But it's already too late.

36:29.562 --> 36:30.980
Can I visit you tomorrow?

36:31.063 --> 36:33.441
What are you talking about?
We're shooting tomorrow.

36:36.319 --> 36:39.322
I'm sorry, I'll be right over.

36:44.660 --> 36:46.162
What do I do?

36:48.831 --> 36:51.292
Was that a mistake, Mr. Nam Seok-hoon?

36:51.375 --> 36:54.086
But it was her who seduced me first.

36:54.170 --> 36:57.215
There's not just one or two
trying to win favors with me, you know.

36:59.759 --> 37:01.344
Look, I have a daughter myself.

37:01.427 --> 37:03.512
And you accuse me
of being a sexual predator?

37:05.223 --> 37:08.059
Honestly, I'm at a loss for words.
And let me ask you this.

37:08.684 --> 37:10.895
Do you have evidence?

37:10.978 --> 37:13.022
Do you?

37:15.274 --> 37:17.276
Technology has sure improved these days.

37:18.027 --> 37:21.364
-What?
-This hard drive, which you…

37:23.658 --> 37:25.409
hammered on and threw out.

37:26.327 --> 37:28.871
They had no trouble
restoring all the data!

37:29.789 --> 37:32.667
I understand, every man has
a hidden folder on their PC.

37:32.750 --> 37:37.171
But your tastes were a little
different from the rest.

37:37.255 --> 37:40.383
-Prosecutor…
-You're a paid member of the VIP Room.

37:40.466 --> 37:43.344
Their memberships come
at quite a price, don't they?

37:44.303 --> 37:45.721
That's not it…

37:46.264 --> 37:48.266
Your family would be in for a surprise

37:48.349 --> 37:50.768
if they learn about your hobbies.

37:50.851 --> 37:52.019
Especially your daughter.

37:52.687 --> 37:53.771
Wouldn't you agree?

38:00.861 --> 38:04.282
For the Defendant, who abused his standing

38:04.365 --> 38:07.451
in the entertainment industry
for his sexual predation,

38:07.535 --> 38:09.578
the Prosecution demands
20 years' imprisonment

38:09.662 --> 38:12.415
as well as medication treatment
of his sexual impulse

38:12.498 --> 38:14.417
so he will never commit
such offenses again.

38:14.500 --> 38:15.710
What?

38:17.586 --> 38:18.587
Don't tell me…

38:20.131 --> 38:22.091
By "medication treatment
of sexual impulse,"

38:22.842 --> 38:24.760
are you referring to chemical castration?

38:25.261 --> 38:28.806
But that is a costly option,
and is not a fundamental solution.

38:31.142 --> 38:32.560
What a surprise.

38:32.643 --> 38:34.562
-Then are you, Prosecution--
-Yes.

38:34.645 --> 38:36.897
The Prosecution demands…

38:40.526 --> 38:42.695
physical castration for our Defendant.

38:46.741 --> 38:48.868
-But this isn't what they promised!
-Just wait.

38:48.951 --> 38:50.995
Your Honor, but this is just--

38:51.078 --> 38:54.373
Beasts have no human rights.

38:54.457 --> 38:56.917
And that is the will
of the majority of our people.

38:59.170 --> 39:00.880
Wouldn't you agree, Your Honor?

39:01.464 --> 39:02.465
That's right!

39:05.760 --> 39:07.261
DEFENDANT

39:09.055 --> 39:10.056
Judge Kang.

39:36.290 --> 39:38.209
You want me to take a gamble?

39:39.543 --> 39:43.255
Rather than gamble,
it's like giving Kang Yo-han homework.

39:43.339 --> 39:45.591
What if Kang really rules so?

39:45.674 --> 39:49.011
You saw the public's reaction
when the photo was up on the screen.

39:49.095 --> 39:52.431
Imagining it in your head
and seeing it for real are different.

39:53.224 --> 39:56.102
In fact, it's rather gruesome
just thinking about it.

39:56.769 --> 40:00.272
I'm sure Judge Kang is aware of that too.
He's a smart man.

40:01.649 --> 40:02.983
But if he rejects it?

40:04.068 --> 40:05.653
They will be disappointed then.

40:06.320 --> 40:09.156
<i>That Judge Kang is
no different, after all.</i>

40:10.574 --> 40:13.744
The higher the expectation,
the bigger the disappointment.

40:14.703 --> 40:16.288
Your Honor!

40:19.667 --> 40:21.335
So it is difficult homework.

40:28.926 --> 40:30.177
Your Honor!

40:31.929 --> 40:35.683
I will hear your defense
at our next hearing.

40:36.809 --> 40:38.519
Court adjourned.

41:27.485 --> 41:30.571
WHY DO PET OWNERS RECOMMEND NEUTERING?

41:31.363 --> 41:32.490
Judge Kang.

41:35.784 --> 41:36.869
What is that?

41:37.453 --> 41:38.746
These?

41:38.829 --> 41:40.831
They work superbly, don't they?

41:40.915 --> 41:44.168
They're by a German manufacturer
with 100 years of expertise…

41:44.251 --> 41:47.129
No, I mean the articles
you're looking at now.

41:49.006 --> 41:50.132
You mean these articles?

41:50.966 --> 41:52.009
Don't tell me…

41:53.052 --> 41:56.680
I'm not sure what you're on about.
I've always been interested in animals.

41:56.764 --> 41:58.265
And humans are one of them, are they?

41:58.849 --> 42:02.186
Did you think
I would undermine human dignity?

42:06.398 --> 42:07.733
That's too much.

42:10.277 --> 42:13.197
While I'm used to that gaze of
people who see me as a monster,

42:13.864 --> 42:16.116
but seeing you looking at me like that

42:18.035 --> 42:19.453
hurts me.

42:23.207 --> 42:24.416
That's not what I meant.

42:24.500 --> 42:26.961
<i>Putting it like that should shake him up.</i>

42:27.044 --> 42:28.629
I just…

42:28.712 --> 42:31.882
No. It may not be
your misunderstanding, after all.

42:32.675 --> 42:35.177
Since some humans are born monsters.

42:35.261 --> 42:38.305
-Judge Kang!
-And some of them use revenge

42:38.389 --> 42:41.100
so that they can hunt
for pure entertainment.

42:41.809 --> 42:43.644
Because primordial instinct
is a powerful thing.

42:46.063 --> 42:47.314
Stop bluffing.

42:48.023 --> 42:50.067
So you'd rather be a monster
than be a victim?

42:50.818 --> 42:53.904
You have no courage to accept your pain.

42:54.697 --> 42:55.698
Monster, did you say?

42:59.326 --> 43:00.619
That shook you up, did it?

44:43.430 --> 44:44.682
Come down here.

45:41.572 --> 45:42.656
Don't hit me.

45:45.200 --> 45:46.410
Don't.

46:36.210 --> 46:39.254
I'm sick and tired of this place.

46:58.273 --> 47:00.526
-Come here.
-Hey, stop tormenting her.

47:00.609 --> 47:02.194
-Come here.
-I did nothing.

47:02.277 --> 47:04.655
She came on her own. Right, Komi?

47:05.239 --> 47:07.616
You even gave her a name? Komi? Please.

47:09.701 --> 47:12.246
Why? I think she likes it.

47:12.329 --> 47:14.081
See? She won't move.

47:16.250 --> 47:18.001
Komi, come here.

47:18.794 --> 47:20.629
-Look here!
-She won't go to you.

47:32.224 --> 47:34.560
Come here.

47:35.185 --> 47:36.436
What is it?

47:38.146 --> 47:39.147
Come here.

47:39.856 --> 47:41.149
She's responding.

47:42.234 --> 47:43.694
That was a big one.

47:47.155 --> 47:49.950
Let's see who she'll come to. Come here.

47:50.701 --> 47:51.743
Come here!

47:52.244 --> 47:54.037
Come here.

47:54.538 --> 47:56.248
Bet she won't go to you, Elijah.

48:00.168 --> 48:01.670
Now go to your sister.

48:02.170 --> 48:04.047
-Here.
-Good girl.

48:05.549 --> 48:08.176
I told you, didn't I?
I'm popular with the street cats.

48:13.557 --> 48:15.017
You like me more, don't you?

48:16.935 --> 48:18.061
Right? You like me more.

48:43.045 --> 48:47.341
I haven't heard much from you lately
ever since you started living with him.

48:48.675 --> 48:49.635
Really?

48:50.385 --> 48:52.638
My health just hasn't been
what it used to be.

48:54.681 --> 48:55.932
Fine.

48:56.516 --> 48:57.809
Let's just go eat.

49:02.147 --> 49:03.774
It's a nice day today.

49:03.857 --> 49:05.192
You're right.

49:08.654 --> 49:10.155
SPEEDY QUICK SERVICE

49:11.740 --> 49:15.410
<i>Suspension, engine, frame…</i>

49:15.494 --> 49:17.412
<i>They're all too much for doing deliveries.</i>

49:24.795 --> 49:26.380
Do you want to go for a drive?

49:27.589 --> 49:28.924
No.

49:29.007 --> 49:30.676
Whatever, I know you do.

49:42.396 --> 49:43.605
Get in.

49:44.231 --> 49:45.982
I can just take this.

49:53.240 --> 49:56.284
POLICE STATION

50:09.840 --> 50:11.258
No, you can't!

50:28.650 --> 50:31.153
If you ever get into another accident
on your motorbike,

50:31.236 --> 50:33.905
I'll take you to your parents' graves
and kill ourselves.

50:42.080 --> 50:44.708
Don't just stand there. Get in.
Are you going to walk home?

50:46.376 --> 50:47.586
Close the boot.

50:50.005 --> 50:52.966
Jeez, is he some gangster or what?

50:59.389 --> 51:01.933
I'll let you ride at the back
if I ever get one.

51:02.017 --> 51:03.185
What did you say?

51:04.478 --> 51:06.313
We're at the Supreme Court.
Lower your voice!

51:06.396 --> 51:07.814
-You…
-Hello.

51:08.482 --> 51:09.608
Hi.

51:10.484 --> 51:12.652
You still haven't come to
your senses, have you?

51:13.278 --> 51:14.946
-You should be an actor?
-What?

51:16.114 --> 51:17.199
Hey.

51:19.075 --> 51:20.577
-Hey!
-Hey!

51:20.660 --> 51:22.788
That's mine!

51:23.955 --> 51:25.290
-We're sorry.
-Sorry.

51:25.373 --> 51:27.584
-That's mine!
-It's fine.

51:27.667 --> 51:29.127
Give it to me!

51:29.211 --> 51:30.670
-Hey!
-This is the place.

51:30.754 --> 51:32.506
SPICY STIR-FRIED PORK

51:32.589 --> 51:33.965
I'm not sure about this place.

51:40.931 --> 51:43.558
I don't know what happened in that house,

51:43.642 --> 51:46.311
but you're not at a position
where you can be neutral.

51:46.394 --> 51:48.396
You're already
a member of that department.

51:50.482 --> 51:52.067
You'll have to choose.

51:53.401 --> 51:54.903
To either become an accomplice,

51:56.154 --> 51:57.531
or the whistleblower.

52:00.617 --> 52:01.701
So make your choice.

52:01.785 --> 52:03.829
Will you stand in my way

52:04.496 --> 52:05.831
or stand with me?

52:11.670 --> 52:14.214
Who shoved me there in the first place?

52:15.298 --> 52:18.593
Dealing with the weight on my chest
is already hard enough for me.

52:18.677 --> 52:21.096
Why should I have to bear
the burden for the world?

52:26.434 --> 52:28.436
It's terrible!

52:28.520 --> 52:31.439
<i>With growing controversy
surrounding flogging,</i>

52:31.523 --> 52:34.276
<i>this time, physical castration
has become a hot topic…</i>

52:35.277 --> 52:38.488
Every time I turn on the TV,
they're talking about that. It's dreadful.

52:41.283 --> 52:44.578
Five! So why did you take it?

52:45.161 --> 52:46.413
Six!

52:46.496 --> 52:48.748
Don't you steal it from us
from now on, all right?

52:48.832 --> 52:50.083
Seven!

52:50.166 --> 52:52.711
This is my favorite doll.

52:52.794 --> 52:54.296
Eight!

52:54.379 --> 52:56.047
That hurts, right?

52:56.131 --> 52:58.717
Harder!

53:05.932 --> 53:08.226
Good on you!

53:08.894 --> 53:10.395
More!

53:10.478 --> 53:11.730
Eight!

53:12.981 --> 53:13.982
What is it?

53:14.065 --> 53:15.442
We were only playing.

53:16.693 --> 53:18.069
Give it back.

53:19.070 --> 53:20.405
Please.

53:24.409 --> 53:26.077
Please give it back to us.

53:28.622 --> 53:30.165
Didn't you hear us?

53:32.042 --> 53:33.168
Mister?

53:35.128 --> 53:38.089
JUKCHANG LIVE

53:38.173 --> 53:40.550
Prepare to change Korea!

53:40.634 --> 53:44.638
Are you all here with me on Jukchang TV,

53:44.721 --> 53:45.889
<i>to hope for the snipping?</i>

53:45.972 --> 53:47.599
<i>Are you?</i>

53:47.682 --> 53:50.060
<i>So, do you all have your scissors ready?</i>

53:50.727 --> 53:52.270
Good on you.

53:53.688 --> 53:58.777
Man, Yo-han should really see this.

53:58.860 --> 53:59.903
Are you watching us?

53:59.986 --> 54:04.074
<i>Do you see our desperate prayers?
To be honest with you,</i>

54:04.157 --> 54:06.868
<i>I wouldn't expect any surprises
with this next hearing.</i>

54:07.369 --> 54:09.579
Why? Because the verdict
will be an obvious one.

54:10.372 --> 54:12.290
Our brother Yo-han will just snip him off.

54:12.374 --> 54:15.961
Nam Seok-hoon, you trashy bastard
who's ruining us men's reputation…

54:16.044 --> 54:17.504
Tomorrow…

54:19.422 --> 54:22.884
<i>you shall be snipped brutally</i>

54:23.677 --> 54:25.679
<i>by our Judge Kang.</i>

54:28.598 --> 54:30.475
<i>Good work today!</i>

54:30.558 --> 54:33.186
<i>Don't get hurt, because I'll be hurt too!</i>

54:33.269 --> 54:34.729
<i>Marry me, Ga-on!</i>

54:34.813 --> 54:38.233
<i>-Marry me!
-Marry me, Ga-on!</i>

54:48.910 --> 54:51.079
<i>We are Kang Yo-han.</i>

54:51.162 --> 54:53.206
<i>Kang Yo-han!</i>

54:53.289 --> 54:54.874
<i>Kang Yo-han!</i>

54:55.625 --> 54:57.335
<i>Kang Yo-han!</i>

54:57.419 --> 55:00.213
Why am I stuck with these bastards?

55:29.576 --> 55:30.535
Ma'am.

55:31.828 --> 55:33.038
Yes, Master.

55:33.747 --> 55:35.290
I said to drop the "Master."

55:37.250 --> 55:39.294
I'm sorry,
but I can't think of another title

55:39.377 --> 55:41.880
whenever I see that face.

55:43.673 --> 55:44.924
All right.

55:45.759 --> 55:47.719
So what's Elijah doing right now?

55:47.802 --> 55:50.263
Probably attending her lecture
since she's a college student.

55:50.346 --> 55:51.848
But it looked like she was talking
to a foreigner.

55:51.931 --> 55:53.683
It's Stanford she's enrolled in.

55:54.267 --> 55:55.435
But how old is she again?

55:56.770 --> 55:58.438
This family's always in a rush.

55:58.521 --> 56:01.399
But that's not somewhere
you can just go to, by rushing it.

56:01.483 --> 56:03.568
Does she even manage
to follow her classes?

56:03.651 --> 56:05.862
She won a scholarship in computer science.

56:05.945 --> 56:07.238
Her grades are stellar.

56:08.073 --> 56:09.449
A family of geniuses.

56:10.575 --> 56:12.702
Still, is it possible to
get an official degree

56:12.786 --> 56:14.788
without even attending
the school physically?

56:16.539 --> 56:18.416
Go ask Master Yo-han,

56:18.500 --> 56:21.294
or try the university's website.

56:30.804 --> 56:32.263
"Elijah Hall?"

56:32.347 --> 56:34.432
Master Yo-han tends to lose his reasoning

56:34.516 --> 56:36.851
when it comes to all things Miss Elijah.

56:38.561 --> 56:40.230
Yes, indeed.

56:44.692 --> 56:45.819
Before that…

56:45.902 --> 56:47.195
Yes?

56:47.278 --> 56:48.655
Snip it off.

56:49.322 --> 56:52.784
-Snip what off?
-What else? That bastard's.

56:52.867 --> 56:54.119
Nam Seok-hoon.

56:54.702 --> 56:56.287
In fact, I'd like to do it myself.

56:57.038 --> 56:58.373
That son of a…

57:17.725 --> 57:19.185
What will we do now?

57:19.853 --> 57:21.896
Even Kang Yo-han won't be
able to go that far.

57:23.940 --> 57:26.860
I only pleaded guilty because
that prosecutor blackmailed me!

57:28.778 --> 57:30.738
What did the prosecution
blackmail you with?

57:30.822 --> 57:32.157
Should we expose him?

57:33.408 --> 57:34.576
No.

57:43.042 --> 57:45.462
Just what is the Prosecution thinking?

57:45.545 --> 57:47.922
What else? They just want attention.

57:48.006 --> 57:51.217
Just throw it out there
and they'll be applauded anyway.

57:52.010 --> 57:54.471
-Still, we can't really…
-Of course not.

57:55.763 --> 57:58.475
Definitely not as judges,

57:58.558 --> 58:00.435
but as a citizen,

58:01.936 --> 58:03.688
I'm not so sure, actually.

58:03.771 --> 58:05.732
Why not? Why can't we?
He's complete trash.

58:13.156 --> 58:14.782
While I share your sentiments,

58:15.366 --> 58:17.869
-will it really be okay?
-What?

58:17.952 --> 58:21.498
Will it be all right for the country
to force a person to go under the knife?

58:21.581 --> 58:23.750
Will it really be okay to permit that?

58:25.919 --> 58:26.961
Because…

58:29.422 --> 58:31.883
I fear the country

58:33.176 --> 58:34.511
as much as these criminals.

58:35.678 --> 58:38.973
Prosecution, a prison sentence is
still enough punishment.

58:39.057 --> 58:41.559
He'll be after early release
for good behavior then.

58:41.643 --> 58:43.394
And once he's released,
he'll be back to his acts.

58:43.478 --> 58:47.524
-Still, we can't just castrate him!
-No! That's just one way of putting it.

58:47.607 --> 58:50.693
In fact, this is more like treatment.
He is struggling to suppress his impulses,

58:50.777 --> 58:53.112
so the country is offering to treat him!

58:53.196 --> 58:54.614
Your Honor, this is barbaric.

58:54.697 --> 58:56.699
Even criminals have human rights--

58:59.577 --> 59:00.870
Your Honor?

59:02.539 --> 59:03.665
Well…

59:05.583 --> 59:06.960
Your Honor?

59:27.313 --> 59:29.774
For a country that boasts
a relatively low crime rate,

59:29.857 --> 59:32.986
choosing severe punishment
over correction will be--

59:33.069 --> 59:34.237
Where do you live?

59:34.946 --> 59:37.824
-Pardon?
-I asked, where do you live, Counsel?

59:38.533 --> 59:40.159
Well, just an apartment.

59:40.243 --> 59:42.120
With tight security, I bet?

59:42.787 --> 59:46.082
A place with many guards on duty
where visitors aren't allowed in.

59:46.165 --> 59:47.792
That's true, yes.

59:47.875 --> 59:49.043
Counsel.

59:49.127 --> 59:52.171
I studied for a long time
because I'm not so smart.

59:52.255 --> 59:53.381
What are you implying?

59:53.464 --> 59:56.759
I didn't have much either,
so I mostly lived in small rooms.

59:56.843 --> 59:59.762
A place where anyone had access
right up to the door to my room.

1:00:00.972 --> 1:00:03.391
I'm sure you've never once
received a notice that

1:00:03.474 --> 1:00:05.893
a serious offender has moved
to your neighborhood.

1:00:05.977 --> 1:00:09.105
Because not just anyone can live
in your neighborhood, Counsel.

1:00:09.188 --> 1:00:11.024
As for me, that was my every day.

1:00:11.816 --> 1:00:14.736
In fact, there was even a murder
in our neighboring village.

1:00:14.819 --> 1:00:19.157
I've always respected you
for your advocacy in human rights.

1:00:19.824 --> 1:00:22.994
However, a country with a relatively
low crime rate, did you say?

1:00:25.413 --> 1:00:27.790
Not everyone lives
in the same country as you do.

1:00:27.874 --> 1:00:29.500
A country where the poor live…

1:00:31.461 --> 1:00:33.838
is different from the one you live in.

1:00:35.632 --> 1:00:39.052
So please think of their rights too.

1:00:41.763 --> 1:00:42.930
Please.

1:00:57.070 --> 1:00:59.405
DEFENDANT

1:01:11.125 --> 1:01:13.169
It won't do any good to our national image

1:01:14.128 --> 1:01:16.089
if we sentence such inhumane punishment.

1:01:16.798 --> 1:01:17.965
Our Defendant

1:01:18.841 --> 1:01:21.177
is an international star
with much influence.

1:01:21.260 --> 1:01:22.762
With our country in such crisis,

1:01:22.845 --> 1:01:25.473
-is such punishment really--
-I understood your point.

1:01:25.556 --> 1:01:27.350
-Pardon?
-I understood, very well.

1:01:27.433 --> 1:01:28.726
Your Honor!

1:01:28.810 --> 1:01:31.646
We'll take a short break
before we deliver the verdict.

1:02:01.300 --> 1:02:02.593
Let's take a short break.

1:02:03.594 --> 1:02:04.929
Yes, Judge Kang.

1:02:27.910 --> 1:02:29.495
The Prosecution demands
physical castration…

1:02:29.579 --> 1:02:30.663
Snip it off.

1:02:43.176 --> 1:02:44.886
The Court has reached a decision.

1:02:46.763 --> 1:02:48.055
Mr. Nam Seok-hoon.

1:02:50.767 --> 1:02:51.809
Yes.

1:02:51.893 --> 1:02:52.935
I sentence you…

1:02:54.437 --> 1:02:56.606
to 20 years in prison.

1:03:00.651 --> 1:03:01.861
Yes, Your Honor.

1:03:01.944 --> 1:03:03.070
20 YEARS' IMPRISONMENT

1:03:08.910 --> 1:03:10.286
And…

1:03:12.830 --> 1:03:13.831
And?

1:03:34.477 --> 1:03:35.478
That's all.

1:03:37.104 --> 1:03:38.064
Your Honor!

1:03:41.192 --> 1:03:43.110
Twenty years, and that's it?

1:04:43.796 --> 1:04:47.091
That was too close.

1:04:48.342 --> 1:04:50.970
Now I should spend some money

1:04:51.053 --> 1:04:54.140
to get myself out on parole somehow.

1:04:55.016 --> 1:04:56.225
Oh, my stomach.

1:04:57.560 --> 1:04:58.644
What's wrong with me?

1:05:10.615 --> 1:05:11.657
Help me.

1:05:13.451 --> 1:05:14.660
Help!

1:05:17.538 --> 1:05:20.249
Help!

1:05:22.209 --> 1:05:24.211
It's acute appendicitis,
so no need to worry.

1:05:24.295 --> 1:05:25.671
It's a simple surgery.

1:05:39.894 --> 1:05:41.437
What's going on?

1:05:42.188 --> 1:05:43.773
Doctor?

1:05:44.899 --> 1:05:46.609
I've woken up.

1:05:47.276 --> 1:05:50.905
Are you? We'll be done soon,
so don't worry.

1:05:50.988 --> 1:05:52.156
Okay.

1:05:53.157 --> 1:05:56.369
So where are the nurses?

1:05:57.578 --> 1:05:59.497
Why are you the only one here?

1:06:00.414 --> 1:06:02.833
I said don't worry.

1:06:04.585 --> 1:06:07.004
Excuse me…

1:06:07.088 --> 1:06:10.299
Where are you operating on, exactly?

1:06:11.634 --> 1:06:13.177
Geez, you're too chatty.

1:06:22.520 --> 1:06:24.522
Why can't you just stay quiet?

1:06:27.441 --> 1:06:29.777
You really don't know
where I'm operating on?

1:06:29.860 --> 1:06:31.612
But you do.

1:06:37.118 --> 1:06:39.370
-You're…
-Don't worry.

1:06:39.453 --> 1:06:41.038
I'll do a beautiful job for you.

1:06:52.675 --> 1:06:55.344
This is a masterpiece by German craftsmen.

1:06:55.428 --> 1:06:56.387
Isn't it beautiful?

1:06:58.848 --> 1:07:00.975
I'll do a beautiful job
down there for you too.

1:07:01.058 --> 1:07:02.893
I'll do a beautiful job!

1:07:12.945 --> 1:07:15.364
What? You dozed off,
and had daydreams too?

1:07:17.908 --> 1:07:20.036
You're still not in your full health.

1:07:20.119 --> 1:07:21.162
It's time.

1:07:21.245 --> 1:07:22.413
Let's go.

1:07:52.443 --> 1:07:56.030
We thought hard about finding
the most condign punishment.

1:07:57.281 --> 1:07:58.199
Mr. Nam.

1:08:00.826 --> 1:08:01.952
Yes, Your Honor.

1:08:03.287 --> 1:08:05.748
Our judging panel could not
come to a consensus,

1:08:05.831 --> 1:08:09.085
so settled on sentencing you
to penal servitude only.

1:08:09.960 --> 1:08:11.253
Your Honor!

1:08:12.338 --> 1:08:13.589
However…

1:08:14.965 --> 1:08:18.177
you will be serving your term
at a facility

1:08:18.260 --> 1:08:20.346
with the highest expertise
on sexual offenses.

1:08:20.429 --> 1:08:21.889
What do you mean, exactly?

1:08:22.890 --> 1:08:24.266
Let's take a look.

1:08:29.271 --> 1:08:33.192
This is a facility located in Texas, USA,
for habitual sexual offenders.

1:08:33.943 --> 1:08:36.237
Our two judicatures have
signed a special MoU

1:08:36.320 --> 1:08:40.157
for mutual cooperation on punishment
of sexual offenses.

1:08:41.075 --> 1:08:43.744
Please join your fellow offenders there

1:08:43.828 --> 1:08:46.330
who are struggling to overcome
issues similar to yours.

1:08:46.997 --> 1:08:48.165
For the next 20 years.

1:09:16.360 --> 1:09:17.903
No… I can't. I won't!

1:09:30.749 --> 1:09:32.543
We believed in you, Judge Kang!

1:10:12.541 --> 1:10:14.335
So this is how he solved his homework.

1:10:16.128 --> 1:10:20.341
Kang Yo-han, so you know
how to surprise your teacher.

1:10:44.615 --> 1:10:46.075
You seem to be in a good mood.

1:10:47.785 --> 1:10:50.287
It's not so bad bestowing benevolence,
once in a while.

1:10:51.747 --> 1:10:52.873
Benevolence?

1:10:52.957 --> 1:10:56.126
Before that, I was told you had
a strange dream during our break.

1:10:58.712 --> 1:11:01.173
-Yes.
-What do you take me for?

1:11:01.966 --> 1:11:04.635
How could I do such a thing?

1:11:06.679 --> 1:11:08.389
Sure, whatever.

1:11:09.431 --> 1:11:11.642
By the way,
Elijah has been sleeping all day.

1:11:12.810 --> 1:11:15.980
Today's Saturday. Let her sleep.
I bet she couldn't sleep much lately.

1:11:16.063 --> 1:11:17.273
Why?

1:11:17.356 --> 1:11:21.026
Who do you think it was that went through
all the correctional facilities in the US

1:11:21.110 --> 1:11:23.612
to find the most appropriate one
and sign an MoU with the state judiciary?

1:11:23.696 --> 1:11:24.947
What?

1:11:45.259 --> 1:11:46.176
Master.

1:11:51.056 --> 1:11:52.599
This came for you.

1:12:01.025 --> 1:12:02.359
FROM SRF

1:15:26.563 --> 1:15:28.398
You're still as beautiful as ever.

1:16:06.812 --> 1:16:08.146
Don't tell me, you are…

1:16:10.232 --> 1:16:12.150
Hello, Young Master.

1:17:00.282 --> 1:17:03.994
THANK YOU TO JOO SEOK-TAE
FOR HIS SPECIAL APPEARANCE

1:17:31.897 --> 1:17:33.273
<i>Blackmailing me is useless.</i>

1:17:34.358 --> 1:17:39.071
We received a report that Judge Kang
had offered a large sum of money.

1:17:39.154 --> 1:17:40.530
That's too bad.

1:17:40.614 --> 1:17:43.867
Public opinion can be rash and brutal.

1:17:43.950 --> 1:17:47.454
Once the seed of doubt sprouts,
it'll grow and grow.

1:17:47.537 --> 1:17:49.122
Su-hyeon, this is dangerous.

1:17:49.206 --> 1:17:51.124
<i>You shined the most.</i>

1:17:51.208 --> 1:17:53.293
Twinkle, twinkle.

1:17:53.377 --> 1:17:55.712
Whoever messes with her will have to
deal with me. No matter who that is.

1:17:55.796 --> 1:17:56.922
<i>What are you doing?</i>

1:17:57.005 --> 1:17:59.007
<i>How dare you mess with Su-hyeon!</i>

1:17:59.091 --> 1:18:01.385
<i>So you say you have nothing to protect?</i>

1:18:02.302 --> 1:18:04.054
<i>There's no one like that.</i>

1:18:05.472 --> 1:18:09.768
