00:02.085 --> 00:03.711
-<i> HOT IN CLEVELAND</i> IS RECORDED

00:03.795 --> 00:05.922
IN FRONT OF
A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:06.005 --> 00:08.800

HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY.

00:08.883 --> 00:10.427
- THANK YOU, VICTORIA.

00:10.510 --> 00:13.388

EACH OF YOU, AND FOR ME.

00:16.181 --> 00:17.976
THAT WAS SWEET.
both: AWW.

00:18.059 --> 00:19.269
- OKAY, THAT'S DONE.

00:19.352 --> 00:21.479
LET'S DRINK.

00:21.563 --> 00:24.441
- SWEATS, PIZZA AND WINE.

00:24.524 --> 00:28.278
IT'S LIKE THE COVER
OF <i> GIVING UP</i> MAGAZINE.

00:28.361 --> 00:29.446
- IT'S NOT GIVING UP.

00:29.529 --> 00:30.447
WE CHOSE NOT TO GO OUT

00:30.530 --> 00:31.489
ON VALENTINE'S DAY.

00:31.573 --> 00:32.615
- OH, I'M SORRY.

00:32.698 --> 00:35.910
<i>DENIAL</i> MAGAZINE.

00:35.994 --> 00:37.912
- ELKA, YOU LOOK VERY NICE.

00:37.996 --> 00:39.456
SO WHO'S THE LUCKY MAN TONIGHT?

00:39.539 --> 00:41.249
- OH, GERALD.

00:41.332 --> 00:44.919
OR HAROLD...OR SOMETHING.

00:45.003 --> 00:47.630
I KEEP THINKING ABOUT
LAST VALENTINE'S DAY.

00:47.714 --> 00:50.133
- WHEN YOU WERE WITH MAX?
- YES.

00:50.216 --> 00:54.637
OH, I LOVE FRED AND ROY
AND--AND BOBBY.

00:54.721 --> 00:59.434
AND I--YOU KNOW, I LIKE JACK
AND--AND LESTER AND ERNIE.

00:59.517 --> 01:02.937
OH, BUT THERE'S JUST
NOBODY LIKE MY MAX.

01:03.021 --> 01:05.355
- YEAH, I GET IT, VALENTINE'S
DAY CAN MAKE YOU VERY NOSTALGIC.

01:05.440 --> 01:07.776
THAT'S WHY I'M WEARING MY OLD
SWIM PARKA FROM HIGH SCHOOL.

01:07.859 --> 01:09.986
- YOU WERE ON A SWIM TEAM?

01:10.069 --> 01:13.323
I THOUGHT YOU HAD
A SCOLIOSIS BRACE.

01:13.406 --> 01:15.867
- WELL, YEAH, BUT I WAS
TEAM EQUIPMENT MANAGER.

01:15.950 --> 01:16.993
YOU KNOW, I WOULD
HAND OUT THE TOWELS

01:17.076 --> 01:20.121
AND SHAVE
THE GREEK KIDS' BACKS.

01:22.248 --> 01:24.834
ON THE PLUS SIDE, I WAS VOTED

01:24.918 --> 01:27.837
"HOTTEST GIRL
IN A BACK BRACE."

01:27.921 --> 01:30.673
UNTIL THAT PERKY CHEERLEADER
FELL OFF THE PYRAMID.

01:34.803 --> 01:38.515
- I'M SORRY, WHAT PART
OF THIS MAKES YOU NOSTALGIC?

01:38.598 --> 01:41.017
- OH, OUR TOP SWIMMER,
NICK COSTAS.

01:41.100 --> 01:42.977
I HAD THE BIGGEST CRUSH
ON HIM.

01:43.061 --> 01:44.521
I STOLE THIS JACKET FROM HIM.

01:44.604 --> 01:47.899
I USED TO FLIRT WITH HIM UNTIL
MY GLASSES WOULD FOG UP

01:47.982 --> 01:51.736
AND SWEAT WOULD DRIP DOWN
AND STING MY JAW LINE ACNE.

01:54.155 --> 01:56.366
I WONDER WHAT HE LOOKS LIKE NOW.

01:56.449 --> 01:58.535
I'M GONNA FACEBOOK HIM.

01:58.618 --> 02:00.870
- OH, I'M BOYCOTTING FACEBOOK.

02:00.954 --> 02:05.250
I DON'T LIKE THE NEW DESIGN.

02:05.333 --> 02:08.127
COULDN'T LET IT ALONE
COULD YOU, ZUCKERBERG?

02:12.298 --> 02:13.550
- OH, THERE HE IS.

02:13.633 --> 02:15.510
OH, MY GOODNESS,
HE'S STILL SO CUTE.

02:15.593 --> 02:16.511
- IS HE MARRIED?

02:16.594 --> 02:17.720
- IT DOESN'T SAY.

02:17.804 --> 02:20.723
HIS STATUS IS "ROAD TRIPPIN'
WITH THE BOYS".

02:20.807 --> 02:22.225
I'M GONNA FRIEND HIM.

02:22.308 --> 02:23.560
- ON VALENTINE'S DAY?

02:23.643 --> 02:25.061
THAT SEEMS A BIT DESPERATE.

02:25.144 --> 02:28.898
- EVEN TO JOY.

02:28.982 --> 02:31.776
- OKAY, OKAY, I'LL WAIT.
[chuckles]

02:31.860 --> 02:35.446
HEY, WHY DON'T WE ALL
TRACK DOWN LOST LOVES?

02:35.530 --> 02:39.075
- OH, I'D LOVE TO CONTACT MAX.

02:39.158 --> 02:43.204
BUT HE'S BEEN REAL MAD AT ME
SINCE I ALMOST MARRIED FRED...

02:43.288 --> 02:46.583
AND RAN AWAY WITH BOBBY.

02:46.666 --> 02:47.917
- WELL, I'M IN.

02:48.001 --> 02:49.252
OOH, I WOULD LOVE TO KNOW HOW

02:49.335 --> 02:51.254
MY FIRST EX-HUSBAND,
CLARK, IS DOING.

02:51.337 --> 02:54.299
HE HAD IT ALL--HE WAS TALL,
GORGEOUS, BRILLIANT.

02:54.382 --> 02:57.760
FEAST YOUR EYES.

02:57.844 --> 03:00.096
AND HE'S A RENOWNED SCIENTIST.

03:00.179 --> 03:03.391
- WHY DID HE DUMP YOU?

03:03.474 --> 03:06.436
I'M ASSUMING.

03:06.519 --> 03:08.521
- I DUMPED HIM.

03:08.605 --> 03:10.940
NO, I--I MEAN HE DIDN'T TAKE
MY ACTING SERIOUSLY

03:11.024 --> 03:13.693
AND HE ALWAYS HAD ALL THESE
STRANGE CREATURES IN THE HOUSE.

03:13.776 --> 03:16.738
NOW HE WAS ESPECIALLY DEVOTED
TO THIS HATEFUL PARROT

03:16.821 --> 03:19.782
WHO ALWAYS USED TO TALK
ABOUT ME BEHIND MY BACK.

03:19.866 --> 03:21.451
- PARROTS CAN'T
MAKE THINGS UP.

03:21.534 --> 03:23.161
THEY JUST REPEAT WHAT YOU SAY.
- YEAH.

03:23.244 --> 03:26.956
- WELL, NOW YOU SOUND
JUST LIKE CLARK.

03:27.040 --> 03:29.459
- SO, JOY,
WHO YOU GONNA LOOK UP?

03:29.542 --> 03:30.585
OH, SORRY.

03:30.668 --> 03:32.462
- OH, THAT'S OKAY.

03:32.545 --> 03:35.798
OBVIOUSLY MY LOST LOVE IS MY
RUNAWAY GROOM, KYLE.

03:35.882 --> 03:39.677
BUT, I REALLY THINK THAT'S BEST
LEFT DEAD AND BURIED...RIGHT?

03:39.761 --> 03:40.803
- YES, OF COURSE.

03:40.887 --> 03:45.308
- BUT, MAYBE IF HE TOLD ME WHY
HE LEFT ME AT THE ALTAR,

03:45.391 --> 03:46.643
I COULD FINALLY GET CLOSURE.

03:46.726 --> 03:47.685
BUT WHAT IF HE'S NOT SORRY?

03:47.769 --> 03:49.103
THAT WOULD KILL ME.

03:49.187 --> 03:50.605
- YES, IT WOULD.

03:50.688 --> 03:53.399
- BUT...WHAT IF HE IS SORRY

03:53.483 --> 03:56.152
AND HE FEELS THE SAME
SPARK WHEN HE SEES ME?

03:56.235 --> 03:57.987
THINGS GET BACK ON TRACK
AND BEFORE YOU KNOW IT

03:58.071 --> 03:59.155
WE'RE MARRIED
AND LIVING IN PROVENCE.

03:59.238 --> 04:00.782
OH, FINE, GET OFF
MY BACK, MELANIE!

04:00.865 --> 04:01.991
I'LL DO IT.

04:02.075 --> 04:04.118
- SO WE ARE FINALLY GONNA SEE

04:04.202 --> 04:05.828
WHAT KYLE LOOKS LIKE.

04:05.912 --> 04:08.331
SEE, SHE CUT HIM OUT
OF ALL HER PHOTOS.

04:08.414 --> 04:09.791
- I CAN'T LOOK.

04:09.874 --> 04:11.167
- IT'S A DOG.
- WHAT?

04:11.250 --> 04:13.962
- I--IT'S A PICTURE OF HIS DOG.

04:14.045 --> 04:16.172
- THAT MEANS HE'S A FATTIE.

04:26.265 --> 04:28.017
{\an8}- MORNING!

04:28.101 --> 04:29.727
{\an8}NICK COSTAS FRIENDED ME BACK.

04:29.811 --> 04:31.354
{\an8}AND NOW WE'RE FLIRTING ONLINE

04:31.437 --> 04:33.815
{\an8}LIKE A COUPLE
OF MIDDLE-AGED TEENAGERS.

04:33.898 --> 04:35.358
{\an8}OH, BOY,
THAT DIDN'T SOUND SEXY.

04:35.441 --> 04:36.734
{\an8}- NO.

04:36.818 --> 04:37.986
{\an8}- BUT THIS DOES.

04:38.069 --> 04:38.987
{\an8}- "HEY, NICK.

04:39.070 --> 04:41.239
{\an8}"'MEMBA ME, MELANIE MORETTI?

04:41.322 --> 04:44.659
{\an8}LONG TIME, NO SWIM."

04:44.742 --> 04:46.828
{\an8}- GOOD, HUH?

04:46.911 --> 04:49.080
{\an8}AND GET THIS, HE IS "ROAD
TRIPPIN' WITH THE BOYS"

04:49.163 --> 04:50.665
{\an8}THROUGH OHIO,

04:50.748 --> 04:52.625
{\an8}AND HE TOLD ME THAT I LOOKED,

04:52.709 --> 04:55.545
{\an8}IN ALL CAPS, "AMAZING"
ON MY FACEBOOK PHOTO.

04:55.628 --> 04:59.382
{\an8}- EVERYTHING HE WROTE
IS IN CAPS.

04:59.465 --> 05:03.219
{\an8}- INCLUDING "AMAZING."

05:03.302 --> 05:06.556
{\an8}- GIRLS, I HAVE
A CONFESSION TO MAKE.

05:06.639 --> 05:09.058
{\an8}I WAS UP ALL NIGHT,
READING ABOUT KYLE ONLINE.

05:09.142 --> 05:10.226
{\an8}- WHAT DID YOU FIND OUT?

05:10.310 --> 05:11.728
{\an8}- HE'S SINGLE.

05:11.811 --> 05:14.188
{\an8}HE'S IN MINNEAPOLIS
TODAY FOR BUSINESS...

05:14.272 --> 05:16.232
{\an8}AND HE JUST HAD A CAPPUCCINO
WITH TWO EXTRA SHOTS

05:16.315 --> 05:17.442
{\an8}ON HENNEPIN AVENUE.

05:17.525 --> 05:19.610
{\an8}- OH, SO HE'S ONE OF THOSE GUYS

05:19.694 --> 05:21.904
{\an8}WHO POSTS EVER LITTLE THING
HE DOES ON HIS WALL.

05:21.988 --> 05:25.241
{\an8}- NO, I HACKED INTO
HIS EMAIL, HIS CAR'S GPS,

05:25.324 --> 05:28.578
{\an8}AND HIS CREDIT CARD ACCOUNTS.

05:28.661 --> 05:31.372
{\an8}TURNS OUT I'M
PRETTY GOOD AT THIS.

05:31.456 --> 05:33.207
{\an8}[doorbell rings]
- OH, I'LL GET IT.

05:33.291 --> 05:35.793
{\an8}WORK OFF ALL
THAT BREAKFAST I DIDN'T EAT.

05:40.339 --> 05:42.592
{\an8}- MY GOD, VICTORIA,
YOU'RE GORGEOUS.

05:42.675 --> 05:43.593
{\an8}- OH, THANK YOU.

05:43.676 --> 05:45.261
{\an8}WHO ARE YOU?

05:45.344 --> 05:47.138
{\an8}- I'M CLARK,
YOUR EX-HUSBAND.

05:47.221 --> 05:48.598
{\an8}I GOT YOUR EMAIL.

05:48.681 --> 05:49.766
{\an8}THOUGHT I'D SURPRISE YOU.

05:49.849 --> 05:51.100
{\an8}- YOU'RE NOT CLARK.

05:51.184 --> 05:53.102
{\an8}CLARK IS STRAPPING AND TALL.

05:53.186 --> 05:56.731
{\an8}- OH, MY LOSS OF HEIGHT WAS DUE
TO THE CALCIUM-LEECHING DISEASE

05:56.814 --> 06:00.735
{\an8}I CONTRACTED FROM THE CALCIUM
LEECHES IN THE AMAZON.

06:00.818 --> 06:03.071
- BUT WHAT ABOUT THE MUSCLES
AND THE CHEEK BONES AND...

06:03.154 --> 06:05.239
AND THE MUSCLES?

06:05.323 --> 06:09.494
- THERE WERE,
UH...VARIOUS TROPICAL FEVERS

06:09.577 --> 06:14.665
AND THE APES WHO I LIVED WITH
USED ME LIKE A THROW TOY.

06:14.749 --> 06:18.127
PLUS MY GYM MEMBERSHIP RAN OUT.

06:18.211 --> 06:21.130
- OH, JOY, MELANIE,
I WANT YOU TO MEET MY--

06:21.214 --> 06:23.674
MY FIRST EX-HUSBAND, CLARK.

06:23.758 --> 06:25.760
- YOU'RE CLARK.
- YES.

06:25.843 --> 06:28.596
- HE ORDERED SOMETHING ON
AMAZON THAT MADE HIM SMALL.

06:36.938 --> 06:39.023
- CLEARLY, I AM, UM,
NOT WHAT YOU EXPECTED.

06:39.107 --> 06:40.650
I THINK MAYBE SURPRISING YOU
WAS A MISTAKE.

06:40.733 --> 06:42.193
UH, I WON'T STAY.

06:42.276 --> 06:43.611
- NO, NO, NO,
OF COURSE YOU'LL STAY.

06:43.694 --> 06:45.154
I--I INSIST.

06:45.238 --> 06:47.031
UH, WHERE'S YOUR LUGGAGE?

06:47.115 --> 06:48.533
- IT'S RIGHT OUT HERE
WITH BARRY.

06:48.616 --> 06:49.784
- BARRY?

06:49.867 --> 06:53.746
OH THAT HORRIBLE PARROT
IS STILL ALIVE?

06:53.830 --> 06:56.833
- HELLO...BITCH.

07:06.050 --> 07:07.677
- I SAW THE LIGHT ON.

07:07.760 --> 07:09.512
- OH, ELKA.

07:09.595 --> 07:11.305
I'VE WRITTEN AN EMAIL TO KYLE

07:11.389 --> 07:12.974
THAT COULD BREAK
THE SILENCE BETWEEN US.

07:13.057 --> 07:16.310
BUT I--I JUST CAN'T
SEEM TO PRESS SEND.

07:16.394 --> 07:18.729
- OH, WHEN YOU'RE READY,
YOU'LL KNOW IT.

07:18.813 --> 07:22.024
- THANKS.

07:22.108 --> 07:24.986
I'LL WAIT TILL IT FEELS RIGHT.

07:25.069 --> 07:27.822
GOOD NIGHT.
- GOOD NIGHT.

07:32.493 --> 07:34.287
FEELS RIGHT TO ME.

07:40.293 --> 07:41.210
- I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

07:41.294 --> 07:43.379
I MEAN, LAST NIGHT,
CLARK KEPT TELLING ME

07:43.462 --> 07:44.547
HOW HE'S STILL ATTRACTED TO ME

07:44.630 --> 07:46.215
AND I--I DON'T WANNA HURT HIM.

07:46.299 --> 07:49.385
- VICTORIA, IT'S NOT LIKE
CLARK IS SOME SORT OF TROLL.

07:49.468 --> 07:52.263
HE'S JUST NOT THE HUGE,
STRAPPING MAN THAT YOU REMEMBER.

07:52.346 --> 07:53.723
HE'S STILL BRILLIANT.

07:53.806 --> 07:54.724
- YEAH, WELL,
HE SEEMED A LOT MORE

07:54.807 --> 07:58.060
BRILLIANT WHEN HE COULD
LIFT ME WITH ONE ARM.

07:58.144 --> 08:00.521
- KYLE USED TO PICK ME UP
AND THROW ME ON THE BED.

08:00.605 --> 08:02.899
I'VE GOTTA STOP
THINKING ABOUT HIM.

08:02.982 --> 08:05.902
OR AT LEAST PICTURE HIM
AS SOME HIDEOUS ELEPHANT MAN.

08:05.985 --> 08:08.029
HOW PATHETIC AM I THAT
THE ELEPHANT MAN

08:08.112 --> 08:10.948
LEFT ME AT THE ALTAR.

08:11.032 --> 08:13.242
- I KNOW. I'LL JUST
LIE TO CLARK AND TELL HIM

08:13.326 --> 08:14.785
I GOT SOME PART
IN A MOVIE.

08:14.869 --> 08:16.037
I'LL PRETEND TO FLY
TO HOLLYWOOD,

08:16.120 --> 08:17.455
AND THEN HE'LL LEAVE

08:17.538 --> 08:20.416
AND TAKE THIS ANNOYING,
UNLOVABLE MONSTER WITH HIM.

08:20.499 --> 08:22.543
- [bleep] YOU.

08:24.962 --> 08:26.756
- BARRY, ARE YOU OKAY?

08:26.839 --> 08:29.342
- OKAY, GOOD LUCK
WITH ALL OF THAT.

08:29.425 --> 08:32.260
- I'D HIT THAT.

08:32.345 --> 08:33.763
- THANKS.

08:33.846 --> 08:36.807
- HOW DO YOU KNOW HE
WASN'T TALKING TO ME?

08:36.890 --> 08:39.894
- OH, OH, CLARK,
THERE YOU ARE.

08:39.977 --> 08:42.270
UM, THERE'S SOMETHING
THAT I NEED TO TELL YOU.

08:42.355 --> 08:46.108
- CLARK'S A TROLL.

08:46.192 --> 08:47.485
- WHAT?
YOU SAID I WAS A TROLL?

08:47.568 --> 08:49.403
- NO, OF COURSE NOT.

08:49.487 --> 08:51.489
- WELL HE DOESN'T JUST MAKE
THESE THINGS UP.

08:51.572 --> 08:53.241
WHAT ELSE HAVE YOU
BEEN SAYING ABOUT ME?

08:53.324 --> 08:56.285
- HIDEOUS ELEPHANT MAN.

08:56.369 --> 08:58.371
- JOY SAID THAT.

08:58.454 --> 09:00.623
- WHAT?!
- BUT NOT ABOUT YOU.

09:00.706 --> 09:05.962
LOOK, UM, I--I JUST FOUND OUT
THAT I GOT A PART IN A MOVIE.

09:06.045 --> 09:09.090
- LIE TO CLARK ABOUT A MOVIE.
- BARRY!

09:09.173 --> 09:11.842
- WOW, EVEN BACK
IN OUR WORST DAYS

09:11.926 --> 09:13.469
YOU NEVER LIED TO ME.

09:13.552 --> 09:15.763
I'M SORRY I'M SUCH
A DISAPPOINTMENT

09:15.846 --> 09:17.640
TO YOU, VICTORIA.

09:17.723 --> 09:19.350
- I'D HIT THAT.

09:19.433 --> 09:21.519
- THANK YOU, BARRY.

09:25.648 --> 09:27.817
- JOY, NICK'S COMING
TO CLEVELAND TONIGHT.

09:27.900 --> 09:29.610
HE WANTS ME TO MEET HIM
IN HIS HOTEL ROOM.

09:29.694 --> 09:31.153
- CONGRATULATIONS.

09:31.237 --> 09:32.822
- YOU HAVE
A DATE TONIGHT TOO, JOY.

09:32.905 --> 09:34.282
- NO, I DON'T.

09:34.365 --> 09:36.409
- UH...

09:36.492 --> 09:40.329
AFTER YOU WENT TO SLEEP,
I, UH, PRETENDED I WAS YOU,

09:40.413 --> 09:43.791
AND...I.M.-ED KYLE.

09:43.874 --> 09:46.210
- WHAT?
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

09:46.294 --> 09:49.088
- BECAUSE I KNEW YOU
SECRETLY WANTED ME TO.

09:51.757 --> 09:54.969
AND I'D HAD A FEW.

09:55.052 --> 09:58.681
- WHAT DID YOU SAY?

09:58.764 --> 10:01.183
- A LOT OF BACK AND FORTH.

10:01.267 --> 10:04.145
IT GOT HOT FOR A WHILE,
AND...

10:04.228 --> 10:06.689
THEN IT COOLED DOWN, AND...

10:06.772 --> 10:10.109
THEN IT GOT HOT AGAIN.

10:10.192 --> 10:13.195
- "I'LL MEET YOU AT THE TOP
OF THE TERMINAL TOWER TONIGHT

10:13.279 --> 10:17.366
WEARING NOTHING BUT
ME RAIN COAT."

10:17.450 --> 10:20.161
I AM NOT SHOWING UP
WEARING ONLY A RAIN COAT.

10:20.244 --> 10:21.871
- WHY NOT?

10:21.954 --> 10:24.540
GUYS LOVE THAT "NAKED
UNDER A COAT" THING.

10:26.459 --> 10:29.253
- GUYS DO, DON'T THEY?

10:32.340 --> 10:34.008
HI, NICK.

10:34.091 --> 10:35.509
- HEY, MELANIE.

10:35.593 --> 10:39.263
- ARE YOU READY
TO SEE ALL THE SIGHTS?

10:39.347 --> 10:42.350
- WE SURE ARE!

10:42.433 --> 10:43.934
- HI.
- HI.

10:44.018 --> 10:46.937
I'M ALISON.
PREGNANT, NOT FAT.

10:47.021 --> 10:49.565
- [laughs]
WELL, CONGRATULATIONS.

10:49.649 --> 10:50.566
- THANK YOU.

10:50.649 --> 10:52.360
- I'M MELANIE MORETTI.

10:52.443 --> 10:54.362
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
ROAD TRIPPIN' WITH THE BOYS.

10:54.445 --> 10:55.571
- OH, WE ARE, YEAH.

10:55.654 --> 10:56.572
BOYS, COME IN HERE.

10:56.655 --> 10:59.909
- [laughs nervously]

10:59.992 --> 11:04.413
THE BOYS...ARE SO ADORABLE.

11:04.497 --> 11:06.749
- HERE, LET ME TAKE YOUR COAT--
- OH, GOD NO!

11:06.832 --> 11:09.627
I MEAN...NO,
THANK YOU, THAT'S...

11:11.629 --> 11:14.715
- OH, GOD, I'M A NERVOUS WRECK.

11:14.799 --> 11:16.759
ONCE WE GET TO THE ROOF,
YOU HAVE TO BE HONEST

11:16.842 --> 11:18.928
AND TELL KYLE
YOU WROTE THOSE MESSAGES.

11:19.011 --> 11:20.596
THEN YOU HAVE TO LIE
AND TELL HIM THAT

11:20.679 --> 11:23.265
I'M HAPPILY IN LOVE WITH
A SOUTH AFRICAN PRO GOLFER.

11:23.349 --> 11:26.435
- OKAY.

11:26.519 --> 11:29.313
- A MALE, SOUTH AFRICAN
PRO GOLFER.

11:29.397 --> 11:31.690
- OH, YOU'RE NO FUN.

11:31.774 --> 11:35.444
- HOLD THE ELEVATOR!

11:35.528 --> 11:38.781
- MAX!
- ELKA.

11:38.864 --> 11:40.658
WERE YOU COMING HERE
TO SEE ME?

11:40.741 --> 11:42.368
- NO.

11:42.451 --> 11:45.454
I FORGOT YOUR OFFICE
WAS EVEN IN THIS BUILDING.

11:45.538 --> 11:48.791
- OH, I SEE.

11:48.874 --> 11:52.294
SO WHY ARE YOU DRESSED
SO PROVOCATIVELY?

11:52.378 --> 11:55.464
YOU KNOW THAT'S
MY FAVORITE TRACK SUIT.

11:55.548 --> 11:58.342
- OH...WELL, I'M ONLY
HERE TO MEET THE GUY

11:58.426 --> 12:00.302
WHO DUMPED JOY
ON HER WEDDING DAY.

12:00.386 --> 12:02.972
- HE DIDN'T ASK.

12:03.055 --> 12:04.765
- [chuckles]
WHAT A COINCIDENCE.

12:04.849 --> 12:08.269
YOU DUMPED ME
ON YOUR WEDDING DAY, ELKA.

12:08.352 --> 12:10.187
- CLEARLY WEDDINGS
ARE A SORE SUBJECT.

12:10.271 --> 12:11.605
NO MORE TALK ABOUT WEDDINGS.

12:11.689 --> 12:14.275
- AGREED.
- AGREED.

12:14.358 --> 12:16.110
- HOLD THE DOOR.

12:19.071 --> 12:22.199
- HI.
WE JUST GOT MARRIED.

12:22.283 --> 12:23.826
- OH, GREAT, SOMEBODY
ALREADY PRESSED ROOF.

12:23.909 --> 12:25.661
- OH...THAT'S WHERE HE PROPOSED.

12:25.744 --> 12:27.288
WE'RE GOING UP TO HAVE
A GLASS OF CHAMPAGNE

12:27.371 --> 12:28.831
BEFORE WE GO TO THE HOTEL.

12:28.914 --> 12:31.500
- NOW WHAT?

12:31.584 --> 12:35.671
- RELAX, THIS HAPPENS
ALL THE TIME.

12:35.754 --> 12:40.676
UH...THAT'S NEW THOUGH.

12:40.759 --> 12:43.804
- I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU STILL
HAVE ONE OF OUR OLD SWIM PARKAS.

12:43.888 --> 12:45.514
- ARE YOU SURE I CAN'T TAKE IT?

12:45.598 --> 12:47.475
YOU'RE SWEATING.

12:47.558 --> 12:48.809
- OH, YEAH.

12:48.893 --> 12:50.144
I LIKE TO SWEAT.

12:50.227 --> 12:51.312
- I REMEMBER THAT.

12:51.395 --> 12:52.396
SHE'S MELANIE MORETTI.

12:52.480 --> 12:53.439
WE CALLED HER MELANIE
MORE-SWEATY.

12:53.522 --> 12:56.025
[chuckles]

12:56.108 --> 12:59.236
- I...DID NOT KNOW THAT.

12:59.320 --> 13:00.988
- I'LL GO GET THE KIDS READY.

13:01.071 --> 13:02.156
- OKAY.

13:02.239 --> 13:04.033
- OH, OH, NO!

13:04.116 --> 13:06.160
NICK, THE BABY'S COMING.

13:06.243 --> 13:07.203
- HONEY, ARE YOU SURE?

13:07.286 --> 13:09.038
- YES, WE NEED
TO GET TO A HOSPITAL.

13:09.121 --> 13:11.874
- UH, BUT WHO'S GONNA
WATCH THE KIDS?

13:15.669 --> 13:18.464
- SURE, SURE, NO SWEATY.

13:20.799 --> 13:23.677
- THERE'S NO CELL RECEPTION
SO ALL I NEED YOU TO DO

13:23.761 --> 13:26.347
IS WALK UP TO THE 36TH FLOOR
TO THE OBSERVATION DECK

13:26.430 --> 13:28.724
AND LET HIM KNOW I'M TRAPPED
IN THIS ELEVATOR.

13:28.807 --> 13:30.726
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "NO"?

13:30.809 --> 13:32.061
WELL, YOU'RE FROM CLEVELAND.

13:32.144 --> 13:34.396
I'M SURE YOU COULD USE
THE EXERCISE.

13:34.480 --> 13:37.566
HELLO? HELLO?
[sighs]

13:37.650 --> 13:41.237
THEY STILL HAVE NO IDEA HOW LONG
IT'S GONNA TAKE TO FIX IT.

13:41.320 --> 13:44.573
{\an1}MAYBE WE SHOULD OPEN THAT BOTTLE
OF CHAMPAGNE TO PASS THE TIME.

13:44.657 --> 13:47.785
- AS WE DISCUSSED, MA'AM,
IT'S FOR OUR WEDDING NIGHT.

13:47.868 --> 13:50.120
- IF THERE IS A WEDDING NIGHT.

13:50.204 --> 13:52.248
- I'M SHIPPING OUT TONIGHT.

13:52.331 --> 13:54.708
LAST-MINUTE DEPLOYMENT.
- YOU WERE RIGHT.

13:54.792 --> 13:56.126
WE SHOULD HAVE GONE STRAIGHT
TO THE HOTEL.

13:56.210 --> 13:58.921
- IT'LL BE FINE, SWEETHEART.

13:59.004 --> 14:01.799
BUT A LITTLE MARRIED ADVICE.

14:01.882 --> 14:04.677
NEVER SAY, "YOU WERE RIGHT."

14:07.680 --> 14:10.808
- IT DOES SOUND WEIRD.

14:10.891 --> 14:12.726
- HOW LONG HAVE
YOU TWO BEEN MARRIED?

14:12.810 --> 14:15.854
- UM...WELL...UH...

14:15.938 --> 14:17.147
- ALL RIGHT, I'LL ANSWER.

14:17.231 --> 14:18.440
THEY'RE NOT MARRIED.

14:18.524 --> 14:20.109
THEY WERE ENGAGED,
THEN THEY WEREN'T.

14:20.192 --> 14:21.777
THEN SHE INTERRUPTED
HIS WEDDING.

14:21.860 --> 14:22.945
THEN HE INTERRUPTED
HER WEDDING.

14:23.028 --> 14:24.780
BUT SHE CHOSE
HER DEAD HUSBAND.

14:24.863 --> 14:27.408
BUT NOW SHE'S SORRY BECAUSE
SHE MISSED HER MAX.

14:27.491 --> 14:30.119
- JOY!
- IS THAT TRUE, ELKA?

14:30.202 --> 14:33.497
- WELL, I-IT'S NOT NOT TRUE.

14:35.791 --> 14:37.918
ACTUALLY,
I CHOSE THIS BUILDING

14:38.002 --> 14:39.295
BECAUSE I WAS HOPING
I'D RUN INTO YOU.

14:39.378 --> 14:41.797
- AWW.

14:41.880 --> 14:43.632
- THIS CALLS FOR A CELEBRATION.

14:43.716 --> 14:46.510
HOW ABOUT WE OPEN
THAT CHAMPAGNE?

14:48.220 --> 14:51.307
- PLEASE, STOP FIGHTING.

14:51.390 --> 14:53.475
PLEASE, STOP FIGHTING.

14:53.559 --> 14:56.812
OH, FINE, GO AHEAD AND FIGHT.

14:56.895 --> 14:57.813
[knocks at door]
- EXCUSE ME?

14:57.896 --> 14:58.939
IS THIS ONE OF YOURS?

14:59.023 --> 15:00.649
FOUND HIM EATING FRENCH FRIES

15:00.733 --> 15:02.985
OFF THE ROOM SERVICE TRAY
AND HE WOULDN'T SHARE.

15:03.068 --> 15:04.945
- UH, HE COULD BE ONE OF MINE.

15:05.029 --> 15:06.196
I STARTED WITH THREE.

15:06.280 --> 15:09.491
I--I BETTER TAKE HIM
JUST IN CASE.

15:09.575 --> 15:10.993
- THERE HE GOES.

15:11.076 --> 15:16.206
WELL, UH, YOU LOOK LIKE YOU
COULD USE A HAND.

15:16.290 --> 15:18.834
- OH, I REALLY COULD,
THANK YOU.

15:18.917 --> 15:20.377
- OH, NO, NOT ME.

15:20.461 --> 15:22.004
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO EITHER.

15:22.087 --> 15:23.631
IT'S JUST AN OBSERVATION.

15:23.714 --> 15:27.092
ALTHOUGH, WE COULD DO
WHAT MY PARENTS DID

15:27.176 --> 15:28.719
WHEN MY BROTHER
AND I WENT AT IT.

15:28.802 --> 15:31.305
UH, HAVE A DRINK
AND IGNORE IT.

15:31.388 --> 15:35.643
- WELL, THE MINI BAR IS OPEN.

15:35.726 --> 15:37.186
- SO'S THE BOTTOM
OF YOUR JACKET.

15:37.269 --> 15:40.064
YOU MIGHT WANNA THINK ABOUT
PUTTING SOMETHING ON.

15:46.111 --> 15:47.988
- I'LL JUST GET BARRY AND
WE'LL BE OUT OF YOUR WAY.

15:48.072 --> 15:49.531
- OH, PLEASE DON'T
LEAVE LIKE THIS.

15:49.615 --> 15:52.409
JUST COME AND SIT HERE FOR ONE
MINUTE AND LET ME EXPLAIN.

15:55.746 --> 15:57.998
I DIDN'T SAY THOSE
THINGS THAT BARRY SAID.

15:58.082 --> 16:02.002
HE JUST PICKED RANDOM WORDS
TO MAKE ME LOOK BAD.

16:02.086 --> 16:04.380
- WELL, HE ALWAYS HAS
HATED YOU.

16:04.463 --> 16:06.840
EVER SINCE YOU STOLE
HIS MIRROR.

16:06.924 --> 16:08.008
- I DON'T KNOW WHY
HE NEEDS IT.

16:08.092 --> 16:10.260
HE ALWAYS LOOKS THE SAME.

16:10.344 --> 16:14.390
- [laughs]

16:17.309 --> 16:21.563
VICTORIA, YOU REALLY
HAVEN'T CHANGED.

16:21.647 --> 16:23.232
I WISH I COULD SAY
THE SAME FOR MYSELF.

16:23.315 --> 16:25.359
- OH, CLARK.

16:25.442 --> 16:27.444
- AND THAT'S THE FIRST TIME

16:27.528 --> 16:29.697
YOU'VE LOOKED AT ME
THE WAY YOU USED TO.

16:29.780 --> 16:32.116
- COME ON,
STAY A LITTLE LONGER.

16:32.199 --> 16:34.743
WE CAN TALK ABOUT OLD TIMES
AND I'LL MAKE DINNER;

16:34.827 --> 16:36.370
WHIP UP A POT
OF CLARK'S DELIGHT.

16:36.453 --> 16:38.080
- OH, CLARK'S DELIGHT?

16:38.163 --> 16:40.290
DELICIOUS.

16:40.374 --> 16:41.458
WHAT WAS IN THAT?

16:41.542 --> 16:44.545
- HAMBURGER MEAT AND SUGAR.

16:44.628 --> 16:46.588
I REALLY WAS A LOUSY COOK.

16:46.672 --> 16:48.924
- I DIDN'T NOTICE.

16:49.007 --> 16:51.760
THE SEX WAS TOO GOOD.
- MMM.

16:51.844 --> 16:53.804
- AND THEN I'D START
TALKING ABOUT MY WORK

16:53.887 --> 16:56.140
AND YOUR EYES
WOULD GLAZE OVER.

16:56.223 --> 16:59.101
- I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT BUT IT'S
JUST THAT YOU KEPT ON TALKING

16:59.184 --> 17:01.770
ABOUT THOSE DISGUSTING
SPECIES OF BUGS

17:01.854 --> 17:03.772
THAT YOU WERE STUDYING
AND IT WAS BLEH.

17:03.856 --> 17:06.108
- I KNOW, I KNOW, IT'S TRUE.

17:06.191 --> 17:10.279
HOWEVER, I HAVE DISCOVERED
A PERUVIAN SPIDER THAT MIGHT

17:10.362 --> 17:11.821
ACTUALLY INTEREST YOU.
- MMM.

17:11.905 --> 17:14.282
- IT GENERATES A VENOM
THAT FIGHTS DIABETES.

17:14.366 --> 17:16.827
- OH, THAT'S NICE.

17:16.910 --> 17:19.747
- YOU KNOW, IT HAS
AN INTRIGUING SIDE EFFECT.

17:19.829 --> 17:23.584
IT ERASES WRINKLES
FROM HUMAN SKIN.

17:26.211 --> 17:28.213
- GO ON.

17:31.049 --> 17:35.012
- ALL RIGHT, I SEE
YOUR SCOLIOSIS BRACE

17:35.095 --> 17:39.308
AND RAISE YOU A DROOPY EYE
AND A CORRECTIVE SHOE.

17:39.391 --> 17:41.477
- WOW.

17:41.560 --> 17:42.603
OKAY, YOU WIN.

17:42.686 --> 17:44.855
YOU WERE A BIGGER GEEK
THAN ME.

17:44.938 --> 17:46.732
- IF I WASN'T PRESIDENT
OF THE ROCKETRY CLUB,

17:46.815 --> 17:50.110
I NEVER WOULD HAVE GOTTEN
LAID IN HIGH SCHOOL.

17:50.194 --> 17:52.946
I NEVER GOT LAID
IN HIGH SCHOOL.

17:53.030 --> 17:55.115
- WELL, YOU GOT ME INTO
YOUR PANTS FAST ENOUGH.

17:55.199 --> 17:56.992
BY THE WAY, THANK YOU FOR THIS.

17:57.076 --> 17:58.952
AND THANK YOU FOR NOT ASKING WHY

17:59.036 --> 18:00.287
I WAS WEARING A COAT
WITH NOTHING UNDER IT.

18:00.370 --> 18:04.666
- OH, MEN NEVER NEED
AN EXPLANATION FOR THAT.

18:04.750 --> 18:06.376
SO...
[chuckles]

18:06.460 --> 18:11.507
HERE'S TO...SHARING A DRINK
WITH THE PRETTY BABYSITTER

18:11.590 --> 18:14.176
ONCE THE KIDS ARE ASLEEP.

18:14.259 --> 18:17.971
MAN, WAS THAT EVER A FANTASY
OF MINE IN HIGH SCHOOL.

18:18.055 --> 18:22.017
- YEAH, DID IT GO
SOMETHING LIKE THIS?

18:25.646 --> 18:27.523
- KYLE'S LONG GONE BY NOW.

18:27.606 --> 18:30.359
I DON'T CARE IF THIS
ELEVATOR EVER STARTS.

18:31.485 --> 18:34.154
OF COURSE.

18:34.238 --> 18:36.782
WELL, AT LEAST YOU TWO
CAN START YOUR HONEYMOON NOW.

18:36.865 --> 18:38.575
- NO, THERE'S NO TIME
TO GET TO THE HOTEL.

18:38.659 --> 18:40.953
I GOTTA GET STRAIGHT TO POST.

18:41.036 --> 18:44.039
I'M SORRY, SWEETIE.

18:44.122 --> 18:45.374
- WAIT!

18:45.457 --> 18:48.210
YOUR OFFICE IS ON THIS FLOOR.

18:48.293 --> 18:49.837
- GOOD THINKING.

18:49.920 --> 18:54.174
SOLDIER, GO STORM THAT BEACH.

18:54.258 --> 18:56.510
- WHAT DID HE CALL ME?

18:56.593 --> 18:59.596
- BEACH, HE SAID BEACH.

19:01.807 --> 19:05.227
- OH, DON'T YOU JUST
LOVE A HAPPY ENDING.

19:05.310 --> 19:07.187
[laughs]

19:07.271 --> 19:09.273
OH...

19:16.488 --> 19:19.241
- OH, SO, WAS KYLE
ON THE ROOF?

19:19.324 --> 19:22.870
- NOPE. AND I DON'T EVEN
KNOW IF HE SHOWED UP.

19:22.953 --> 19:23.912
THANKS FOR WAITING UP FOR ME.

19:23.996 --> 19:27.082
- OH, I DIDN'T WAIT UP FOR YOU.

19:27.165 --> 19:30.961
MY NEW BIRD COULDN'T SLEEP.

19:31.044 --> 19:32.838
- YOUR NEW BIRD?

19:36.675 --> 19:38.260
"OFF TO PERU WITH CLARK.

19:38.343 --> 19:41.138
"PURCHASE NO SKIN TREATMENTS
UNTIL I RETURN.

19:43.015 --> 19:44.600
ELKA CAN TAKE CARE OF BARRY."

19:44.683 --> 19:47.477
- I LOVE ELKA.

19:49.062 --> 19:52.274
POOR JOY.

19:52.357 --> 19:55.152
- I, UH, I BROUGHT HIM
UP TO SPEED.

19:57.070 --> 19:59.865
- I'M JUST GONNA UNFRIEND HIM
AND PRETEND IT NEVER HAPPENED.

20:02.159 --> 20:03.785
OH...

20:03.869 --> 20:06.622
HIS PROFILE PICTURE
ISN'T HIS DOG ANYMORE.

20:06.705 --> 20:09.583
IT'S HIM...

20:09.666 --> 20:13.128
AND 25 YEARS OF BURIED
EMOTIONS COME RUSHING BACK.

20:13.211 --> 20:14.922
- OH, JOY.

20:15.005 --> 20:20.093
THE BEST THING TO DO IS JUST
FORGET IT AND MOVE ON.

20:20.177 --> 20:22.971
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

20:23.055 --> 20:27.142
- OH, NO, I'M NOT.
