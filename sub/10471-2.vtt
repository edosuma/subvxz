00:43.920 --> 00:47.999
'I used to think that night
was a time for women.

00:48.000 --> 00:52.671
'All day, the docks were raucous
with the lives of men.

00:52.702 --> 00:55.719
'Lightermen and stevedores,
dockers and pilots,

00:55.720 --> 00:58.869
'the sailors and the drivers
of the trains.

00:59.760 --> 01:05.040
'In the smallest hours,
only the river's voice was heard.

01:06.400 --> 01:08.159
'Only women were awake.'

01:09.140 --> 01:10.684
'Men slept.

01:12.137 --> 01:13.278
'Mostly.'

01:23.364 --> 01:26.637
Are you sure you're a midwife?
You don't half look young.

01:26.723 --> 01:29.559
Don't worry, Ingrid.
You're quite safe.

01:34.640 --> 01:37.919
I'll... kill... him!

01:37.920 --> 01:40.519
I'll bloody kill him when I'm done!

01:42.480 --> 01:44.359
Short breaths.

01:47.320 --> 01:48.519
There.

01:48.520 --> 01:51.497
'She wouldn't kill him.
No mother ever did.

01:52.120 --> 01:56.319
'She would only curse his name, and
say there'd never be a next time.

01:56.320 --> 01:58.080
'And she would mean it.

01:58.081 --> 02:00.799
'And there always was.'

03:04.400 --> 03:06.519
Zakir, I'm with someone.

03:26.800 --> 03:29.000
Take him to the Crystal Room.

03:43.611 --> 03:46.771
She's a bit of all right.

03:48.062 --> 03:49.527
I'm going to call her Dawn.

03:51.344 --> 03:53.160
It's a beautiful name.

03:54.542 --> 03:56.679
Hug, hug.

03:56.680 --> 04:00.679
That's it, nicely. Good girl.

04:00.680 --> 04:03.316
Baby. Baby, yeah.

04:09.400 --> 04:10.759
Don't short-change me.

04:10.760 --> 04:14.033
It's eight bob,
if I bring you inside.

04:20.760 --> 04:23.719
Thought he'd dropped off on the job.

04:23.720 --> 04:27.600
Tell you what, some of them lascars
don't half rub off on you.

04:30.286 --> 04:33.340
Mary! You've got one in the oven.

04:36.651 --> 04:38.131
Is it any wonder?

04:44.676 --> 04:46.596
There's things you can do, Mare.

04:47.979 --> 04:50.019
Things you'll have to do.

04:51.133 --> 04:52.973
And what if I won't?

04:53.840 --> 04:57.188
You can't keep it.
They won't let you.

05:03.040 --> 05:06.479
'I had entered a house
in the dead of night,

05:06.480 --> 05:10.879
'and emerged into sunshine,
leaving a new life behind,

05:10.880 --> 05:14.280
'and I wouldn't have changed my job
for all the world.'

05:16.480 --> 05:19.919
Hello, Jenny!
Up all night again?

05:19.920 --> 05:21.679
Mrs B kept you a kipper.

05:21.680 --> 05:23.880
I'd be quick, if I were you,
or Fred will have it.

05:23.881 --> 05:26.839
I heard that, and I hate kippers.

05:26.840 --> 05:29.839
I tried smoking 'em once.
It's a mug's game.

05:29.840 --> 05:32.039
Flat tyre.

05:32.040 --> 05:34.239
Three advance delivery packs,

05:34.240 --> 05:37.239
one booking-in
and two final home visits.

05:37.240 --> 05:40.679
Nurse Lee! How is Mrs Mason? A little
girl, Sister. No complications.

05:40.680 --> 05:44.079
Good. You'll have to see
to Sister Bernadette's list later.

05:44.080 --> 05:46.759
She's been seconded
to the hospital today.

05:49.960 --> 05:52.119
Nonnatus House. Midwife speaking.

05:52.120 --> 05:54.879
Short-staffed again!
The new trainee is on her way.

05:54.880 --> 05:57.839
I can't deny I'm looking forward
to an extra pair of hands.

05:57.840 --> 06:01.039
Doreen Riley. She's the twins
case in Quebec Street.

06:01.040 --> 06:04.439
We don't need an extra pair of
hands. We need an octopus.

06:04.440 --> 06:07.759
When I get back from Mrs Riley,
I'll contact the aquarium

06:07.760 --> 06:11.064
In the meantime
the new girl's details are on here.

06:18.040 --> 06:21.599
Camilla
Fortescue-Cholmeley-Browne?

06:21.600 --> 06:23.759
Yes.
Come in.

06:23.760 --> 06:26.919
I generally answer to Chummy.
My pa used to say,

06:26.920 --> 06:28.999
"Long dogs need short names."

06:29.000 --> 06:32.239
Mm. Follow me. And mind your head.

06:32.240 --> 06:39.479
I understand you qualified by a whisker,
Nurse Fortescue-Cholmeley-Browne.

06:39.480 --> 06:41.639
I did pass. It was a bit of a scrape.

06:41.640 --> 06:45.959
Before that I was nursing
for five years, and, well...

06:45.960 --> 06:47.999
Come on, inside.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.719
Do you need me to go through this
piece by piece?

06:50.720 --> 06:53.399
No, not remotely. What's that?

06:53.400 --> 06:56.559
It's an enema nozzle.
It's made of glass.

06:56.560 --> 06:58.559
Do you break things?

06:58.560 --> 07:00.239
No.

07:00.240 --> 07:04.039
And are all your dresses pink?
I do have another, in eau de nil.

07:04.040 --> 07:06.559
I bet you look a picture
in that too.

07:06.560 --> 07:08.960
Nurse Lee!

07:37.640 --> 07:39.159
Uniforms.

07:39.160 --> 07:41.879
Standard pale blue. Two.

07:41.880 --> 07:44.519
I found some in the airing
cupboard. All girls together.

07:44.520 --> 07:46.599
That's what we used to say at school.

07:46.600 --> 07:51.178
I could never bear all that fussing and
flapping under dressing capes. Ha-ha.

07:51.720 --> 07:54.159
I've always been a longshanks.

07:54.160 --> 07:57.719
Even as a child in India,
I was always taller than my brothers.

07:57.720 --> 08:00.479
Poor old Mater, she used to be in
tears,

08:00.480 --> 08:03.599
but my ayah just sewed flounces
at the bottom of my frocks.

08:03.600 --> 08:07.520
It would look a bit rum
round the hem of a nurse's outfit.

08:09.880 --> 08:12.999
I can't move my arms.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.520
Those are the biggest size.

08:17.160 --> 08:19.760
Well. Nil desperandum.

08:25.560 --> 08:28.759
The rotating handle
is delicately mechanised.

08:28.760 --> 08:31.879
The cogs will be deranged
if it's pounded out of rhythm.

08:31.880 --> 08:35.039
Don't worry, I've got the measure
of this little warhorse.

08:35.039 --> 08:38.039
I was at the Royal School
of Needlework

08:38.039 --> 08:40.080
before I turned to nursing.

08:41.559 --> 08:45.599
Have you thought of French knots,
to make that jolly fellow's hair?

08:45.600 --> 08:48.359
I intend to furnish it with a beret.

08:48.360 --> 08:51.920
The scalp will not be
visible to view.

10:32.920 --> 10:35.120
I thank you and I love you all!

10:38.360 --> 10:42.159
I wish I could make my own patterns.
I'd save a bomb on clothes.

10:42.160 --> 10:45.159
Yes. I've loved clothes
ever since the New Look.

10:45.160 --> 10:47.439
New Look's old hat, darling.

10:47.440 --> 10:50.559
Aren't you bored
of ironing all those layers?

10:50.560 --> 10:52.520
Only wearing four
tomorrow night.

10:52.521 --> 10:54.479
No room for six in the
Royal Festival Hall.

10:54.480 --> 10:57.119
Another concert? On your own?

10:57.120 --> 10:59.079
Yes. Rachmaninoff.

10:59.080 --> 11:01.919
I've chopped Princess
Margaret's head off.

11:01.920 --> 11:03.999
I was cutting out the sleeve.

11:04.000 --> 11:07.279
She'll be giving me
one of her hard cold stares.

11:07.280 --> 11:09.879
I'm sure she'll forgive you.
I think she looks fun.

11:09.880 --> 11:13.480
She's frightfully vivacious
when she's had a gin.

11:16.680 --> 11:18.919
Not that I know her well.

11:18.920 --> 11:22.239
No, I haven't really seen her
since Pa's investiture.

11:22.240 --> 11:26.039
Investiture?
Yes, he was just...

11:26.040 --> 11:29.519
Well, he was knighted for...
services to the viceroy.

11:29.520 --> 11:32.119
I'd keep that from
Sister Evangelina.

11:32.120 --> 11:35.599
Why? She grew up drinking
out of jam jars.

11:35.600 --> 11:38.599
It's made her a bit of an inverted
snob.

11:38.600 --> 11:40.719
Right, young madam.

11:40.720 --> 11:42.559
Bicycles.

11:42.560 --> 11:45.719
I've got a very nice Rival of
Norwich, with a lightweight frame.

11:45.720 --> 11:50.719
Or a Rover Imperial I reckon's come
off the ark. The choice is yours.

11:50.720 --> 11:53.359
I don't need a bicycle.
Thanks awfully.

11:53.360 --> 11:55.399
Shanks's pony will suffice for me.

11:55.400 --> 11:58.959
Darling, you won't last five minutes
on shanks's pony.

11:58.960 --> 12:00.919
We cover eight square miles.

12:00.920 --> 12:02.920
You can ride a bike?

12:04.120 --> 12:08.679
I can ride a horse. That can't be
so very different, surely?

12:08.680 --> 12:12.279
Once somebody's learned
to ride a bicycle,

12:12.280 --> 12:15.839
they never, ever forget.
Absolutely.

12:15.840 --> 12:18.839
You'll have to do this once.
It's like learning to smoke

12:18.840 --> 12:21.559
or having your ears pierced.
Quite.

12:21.560 --> 12:23.000
Ready? Gosh...

12:23.001 --> 12:25.079
Buckle down.

12:25.080 --> 12:28.239
All right.
Yes, feet on.

12:28.240 --> 12:30.719
And go.

12:30.720 --> 12:33.239
Keep going.
You want to tie her to our go-kart?

12:33.240 --> 12:35.799
You want to button your lip.
I'm sure he means well.

12:37.600 --> 12:41.279
Feet. What?
Feet. Yes.

12:41.280 --> 12:43.479
Feet! Work your feet, Chummy.

12:43.480 --> 12:46.959
Feet. Yes.
Down.

12:46.960 --> 12:50.439
Pedal up, pedal down.

12:50.440 --> 12:52.679
No! Sorry. Sorry.

12:52.680 --> 12:55.079
It's just this alternate
body parts business.

12:55.080 --> 12:58.040
Feet, you know, doing different
things.

12:59.480 --> 13:03.759
One fears there is something in her
that is misaligned.

13:03.760 --> 13:06.639
One suspects a planetary influence.

13:06.640 --> 13:09.439
Pedal up! Pedal down!

13:09.440 --> 13:12.880
The East End'll
eat her for breakfast.

13:43.600 --> 13:44.719
Miss?

13:45.360 --> 13:48.639
Miss? Could you change
a five-pound note for me?

13:48.688 --> 13:52.279
A five-pound note? No, I'm sorry.
I can't.

13:52.280 --> 13:56.639
What about that cafe over there?
I daren't. They'll think I stole it.

13:57.282 --> 13:59.479
Would you go in
and change it for me?

13:59.480 --> 14:01.399
I'm sorry.

14:01.400 --> 14:03.199
Please!

14:03.200 --> 14:05.359
I've not eaten today.

14:05.360 --> 14:07.400
Nor yesterday.

14:11.400 --> 14:13.559
Well, I suppose we could go in
together.

14:13.560 --> 14:16.039
We could get you something to eat.

14:16.040 --> 14:19.868
I could pay using the banknote,
so they'll think it's mine.

14:31.880 --> 14:34.274
First dinner I ever had in England
was like this.

14:35.631 --> 14:37.524
That pie was in silver paper too.

14:38.160 --> 14:41.639
It was in the transport cafe.
That's near Liverpool.

14:41.640 --> 14:43.519
You're not from Liverpool, though?

14:44.024 --> 14:45.384
County Mayo.

14:46.160 --> 14:48.880
Then Dublin, after Dadda died.

14:50.280 --> 14:52.320
That was where our luck ran out.

14:53.320 --> 14:55.960
And Mam fell in love with the drink.

14:57.560 --> 15:00.999
I don't like it when people pry.
I shouldn't pry myself. I'm sorry.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.440
She'll be on the cold tea
and meths by now.

15:04.820 --> 15:07.759
She used to tell me the story
of Dick Whittington and his cat,

15:08.610 --> 15:12.946
and how they came to London
and he heard the bells.

15:13.480 --> 15:15.580
I thought, "What sort
of eejit goes to make

15:15.581 --> 15:17.680
his fortune and takes
his cat with him?"

15:20.360 --> 15:23.798
When she took a man to live with us,
I knew I'd have to leave.

15:24.880 --> 15:27.923
I thought, "I'll take a leaf
out of Dick Whittington's book.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.640
"I'm just not taking any pets."

15:31.016 --> 15:34.235
I thought the boat went from Dublin
straight to London.

15:34.563 --> 15:36.679
I didn't know there was
any other city.

15:36.680 --> 15:38.959
And I hitched a ride
from Liverpool docks.

15:38.960 --> 15:41.440
It was the driver
who bought me the pie.

15:43.040 --> 15:45.200
Did he take advantage of you?

15:47.600 --> 15:49.032
I like your scarf.

15:50.400 --> 15:52.239
It's from Paris.

15:52.240 --> 15:54.320
Is that what the writing on it says?

15:55.680 --> 15:58.480
Did the lorry driver
take advantage of you?

15:59.960 --> 16:01.239
No.

16:01.240 --> 16:03.560
He was the last good Englishman
I met.

16:05.160 --> 16:07.040
It's just...

16:08.200 --> 16:11.279
I can see you're expecting a baby.
Can you?

16:11.280 --> 16:13.759
I've a trained eye. I'm a midwife.

16:13.760 --> 16:15.679
You're not old enough.

16:15.680 --> 16:17.399
I'm older than you.
Sorry, girls.

16:17.400 --> 16:20.200
I'm closing me till.
That's two and nine, please.

16:22.040 --> 16:25.559
I can't change that.
Haven't you got anything smaller?

16:25.560 --> 16:29.519
If you can't change this banknote,
we can't pay for the meal.

16:29.520 --> 16:32.760
Which, of course,
has now been eaten.

16:40.520 --> 16:44.120
Four pounds seventeen
and thruppence.

16:49.840 --> 16:51.376
Is there somewhere you can go?

16:52.560 --> 16:55.040
There's the place I used to work.

16:57.200 --> 16:59.160
But, if I go there, they'll hurt me.

17:02.800 --> 17:06.560
People like you
are supposed to help people like me.

17:14.280 --> 17:15.602
Come on.

17:21.880 --> 17:23.519
I can't wake Sister Julienne now.

17:23.520 --> 17:26.878
The nuns get up to pray
at half past four.

17:26.880 --> 17:28.799
I hate half past four.

17:29.369 --> 17:31.689
It's cold, even in the summer.

17:32.560 --> 17:34.204
Will she let me stay?

17:34.667 --> 17:36.907
She'll know where you can stay.

17:37.760 --> 17:39.360
I thought you were one of my sort.

17:40.160 --> 17:43.279
Only of the grand kind.

17:43.280 --> 17:47.172
It was your lovely coat, and the way you
let it swing when you were walking.

17:48.420 --> 17:52.076
There's a girl called Charmaine in the
place where I was living with Zakir.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.799
She said she was going to go up west

17:55.800 --> 17:58.959
and wear white gloves
and a touch-me-not expression.

18:00.318 --> 18:02.164
She probably thought
she could look like you.

18:05.288 --> 18:07.586
Mary, is Zakir the father
of your child?

18:09.073 --> 18:10.493
I don't think so.

18:11.920 --> 18:14.118
It's such a long time
since he wanted me.

18:15.600 --> 18:17.679
And some nights
I've been with three men.

18:18.179 --> 18:19.602
Even four.

18:21.722 --> 18:24.164
God love your innocence,
Nurse Jenny Lee.

18:26.040 --> 18:27.797
Which of us is the oldest now?

18:50.320 --> 18:51.799
You're not still up?

18:51.800 --> 18:55.759
Bit of an argument
with the bust darts.

18:55.760 --> 18:57.719
Night.

18:57.720 --> 18:59.055
Night.

19:25.280 --> 19:27.599
Pedal up.
Up.

19:27.600 --> 19:31.119
Pedal down.
Down.

19:31.120 --> 19:32.919
Pedal up.
Up.

19:32.920 --> 19:35.479
Pedal down...
Getting it! Getting it!

19:35.480 --> 19:39.159
Bravo, Chummy!

19:39.160 --> 19:42.679
I'm so proud of you, Chummy!

19:46.240 --> 19:49.559
Well done, Chummy!

19:52.400 --> 19:53.759
No!

19:57.080 --> 20:00.239
Move out of the way, please.
Are you all right?

20:07.480 --> 20:10.639
I'm not going out of that door!

20:10.640 --> 20:12.560
I'm safe here!

20:13.600 --> 20:16.399
You'll be safe with Father Joe
at Wellclose Square.

20:16.400 --> 20:18.559
He's set up a refuge
for girls like you.

20:18.560 --> 20:22.039
I'm not going out!
Someone will see me.

20:22.040 --> 20:24.919
You're very afraid of something,
aren't you, Mary?

20:28.600 --> 20:32.720
If you can tell us what it is,
you may be able to help us help you.

20:37.720 --> 20:40.160
There was a girl with a baby in her.

20:41.640 --> 20:44.160
And they sent for a woman to come.

20:45.615 --> 20:48.530
She had a hook,
like the one you knit with.

20:50.480 --> 20:53.799
I had to help to hold her down.

20:53.800 --> 20:57.600
And there was blood,
like in a butcher's.

20:59.800 --> 21:02.000
Did the girl lose the baby?

21:04.040 --> 21:08.040
There was a chamberpot
in the corner of our room.

21:09.200 --> 21:12.440
It had violets printed on the china.

21:13.800 --> 21:17.199
And I saw the baby in there,
no bigger than my hand.

21:17.200 --> 21:20.159
My baby's bigger than my hand now.

21:20.160 --> 21:23.159
I can feel it underneath my heart.

21:24.277 --> 21:28.279
Mary, we're not a nursing home,
or a clinic.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.639
This is where the midwives live.

21:32.640 --> 21:35.799
We look after women in the community.

21:35.800 --> 21:39.956
When you go to Father Joe's,
you'll be in the community

21:40.960 --> 21:43.960
and we'll look after you.

21:50.280 --> 21:52.360
I'll go if Jenny comes.

21:58.280 --> 22:02.519
Fred's mending the dent on your
mudguard. You've got gravel in that.

22:02.520 --> 22:04.799
Botheration.

22:04.800 --> 22:08.239
You are going to have to get
cycling under your belt.

22:08.240 --> 22:10.039
You'll have to find time for it,

22:10.040 --> 22:13.719
just like you've got to find time
for your extra study.

22:13.720 --> 22:15.680
I know, Sister.
I know I barely scratched

22:15.681 --> 22:17.639
a pass at my exams.
But I won't give up.

22:17.640 --> 22:21.639
If you can't serve your patients,
you're a hindrance, not a help,

22:21.640 --> 22:23.799
and you'll have to be replaced.

22:23.800 --> 22:25.599
But I need district experience.

22:25.600 --> 22:27.679
Without it, I can't go to Africa.

22:27.680 --> 22:31.919
What do you want to go there for?
Aren't we good enough for you?

22:31.920 --> 22:35.239
I feel I've been called to work
in Africa by God.

22:35.240 --> 22:39.159
Do you feel called to the
religious life? Gosh, no.

22:39.160 --> 22:42.159
One hopes there might be
some sort of a chap along the way.

22:42.160 --> 22:44.439
I'm quite happy just to be a
missionary.

22:44.697 --> 22:48.681
But when I close my eyes to pray,
I see all these little black faces.

22:49.440 --> 22:52.159
You don't have to up sticks to
Africa to see them.

22:52.160 --> 22:56.640
Just go a bit nearer the docks.
It's not that far... by bicycle.

23:14.040 --> 23:15.879
That's the place I used to work.

23:15.880 --> 23:18.199
It's all right.
I'm not taking you there.

23:18.200 --> 23:20.439
Yes, you are!

23:20.440 --> 23:23.560
No! You are! No, no, no!

23:32.520 --> 23:34.360
Do you know him?

23:36.200 --> 23:37.880
No.

23:52.440 --> 23:54.160
Tea for three.

24:08.120 --> 24:10.559
I hope you've no objection
to fig rolls.

24:10.560 --> 24:12.879
Never had one. Are they foreign?

24:12.880 --> 24:16.360
Probably. I never reckoned
they were up to much.

24:18.240 --> 24:22.360
They taste like treacle
wrapped in a doormat.

24:32.280 --> 24:33.840
I'm not a fallen woman.

24:35.720 --> 24:38.239
No.

24:38.240 --> 24:41.039
I had a boyfriend.

24:41.040 --> 24:43.679
His name was Zakir.

24:43.680 --> 24:48.160
He took me in, when he found me
eating bread left for the birds.

24:51.080 --> 24:53.440
But he worked for his uncle.

24:54.640 --> 24:56.720
And I had to work for his uncle too.

24:57.760 --> 25:00.440
We understand that you were forced.

25:02.120 --> 25:04.079
There is no shame in it.

25:04.080 --> 25:06.120
There isn't for the men.

25:09.040 --> 25:12.239
It's a pimp's trick,
old as the hills.

25:12.240 --> 25:15.159
A young man finds a vulnerable girl,

25:15.160 --> 25:18.599
lures her to bed with a kiss
and kind words.

25:19.014 --> 25:23.479
By the time he's finished with her,
she'd do anything for him.

25:23.480 --> 25:25.799
But don't the girls have
any sense of danger?

25:25.800 --> 25:28.359
They've usually been in danger
all their lives.

25:28.360 --> 25:32.199
If not from violence,
then from hunger and disease.

25:32.200 --> 25:35.839
It's hard to imagine, I grant you,
if you've never lived like that.

25:35.840 --> 25:38.439
I work in the East End, Father.
I know about poverty.

25:38.440 --> 25:40.320
Nurse, I don't think you do.

25:41.400 --> 25:44.359
Poverty isn't bad housing,
dirty clothing, families of ten.

25:44.360 --> 25:47.999
It's never having been loved,
or even respected.

25:48.000 --> 25:51.239
Not knowing the difference
between love and abuse,

25:51.240 --> 25:53.840
a kiss that wasn't
down payment on a blow.

25:59.600 --> 26:02.319
I'm sorry.

26:02.320 --> 26:04.680
You must think me very ignorant.

26:07.160 --> 26:09.479
I think you're very fortunate.

26:09.480 --> 26:11.879
And there's no need to apologise
for that.

27:13.640 --> 27:17.319
What happened to the Wonder Horse?
Will you put a sock in it?

27:17.320 --> 27:20.839
You've a voice like you've swallowed
a foghorn! Good afternoon, Nurse.

27:20.840 --> 27:22.559
Afternoon.

27:22.560 --> 27:24.600
Excuse me.

27:25.680 --> 27:28.400
Size of her.
She could pull a brewer's dray.

27:38.040 --> 27:41.879
I hope everyone's brought
their sample today.

27:41.880 --> 27:44.479
Not the syrup tin again,
Mrs Teeman.

27:44.480 --> 27:47.880
It plays havoc with the sugar test.

27:55.800 --> 27:59.080
Good afternoon.
Or is it good evening?

28:00.600 --> 28:05.119
You're with Dr Turner.
Cubicle on the end.

28:05.120 --> 28:07.519
Hello, Brenda!

28:07.520 --> 28:09.799
Never thought I'd be bumping
into you here!

28:09.800 --> 28:11.799
I remarried. Two years ago.

28:11.800 --> 28:14.880
Well, that's a poke in the eye
for Adolf, innit?

28:17.160 --> 28:21.479
How did you lose
your first husband again?

28:21.480 --> 28:24.359
In the Blitz.
When the sugar works caught fire.

28:24.360 --> 28:28.839
Will I ever forget it? The
gutters ran with fudge for a week.

28:28.840 --> 28:32.519
You're happy, I presume?
Delighted. Aren't you?

28:32.520 --> 28:35.799
I come round to the idea.
I was disgusted at first.

28:35.800 --> 28:37.639
It don't seem right, does it?

28:37.640 --> 28:40.119
Mother of the bride
being in the family way.

28:40.120 --> 28:42.399
Her wedding's in a fortnight.

28:42.400 --> 28:45.119
I've had to buy one of those
trapeze-line coats.

28:45.120 --> 28:48.000
Mrs Brenda McEntee to see Dr Turner.

28:50.560 --> 28:53.520
Good luck, love.
Thank you.

28:58.520 --> 29:00.439
Bowels been normal and regular?

29:00.440 --> 29:02.079
Yeah.

29:02.080 --> 29:04.919
Any vomiting or nausea?
No. That's stopped.

29:04.920 --> 29:08.799
Any swelling of the ankles?
Any fainting or dizziness?

29:08.800 --> 29:10.639
No.

29:10.640 --> 29:15.239
Then we'll examine your tummy.
Mrs McEntee had rickets as a child,

29:15.240 --> 29:17.559
and has a skeletal malformation
as a result,

29:17.560 --> 29:19.959
including what's known
as a rachitic pelvis.

29:19.960 --> 29:22.479
Have you come across it before?
No, I haven't.

29:22.480 --> 29:25.479
Mrs McEntee is a rare bird.

29:25.480 --> 29:29.359
She was deprived of sunlight
and malnourished as a child.

29:29.360 --> 29:32.359
Rickets was a disease of poverty.

29:32.360 --> 29:35.879
Now we have the welfare state
it's become a disease of the past.

29:35.880 --> 29:39.079
As are the problems of pregnancy
she experienced in the past.

29:41.760 --> 29:45.359
Now, come along, Mrs McEntee.

29:45.360 --> 29:48.759
I've been coming along!
I've... I've been trying to be brave.

29:48.760 --> 29:51.999
But I had the quickening this week.

29:52.000 --> 29:54.959
I've felt it move.
Like the others moved.

29:57.480 --> 29:59.520
And I lost every one of them.

30:01.520 --> 30:05.159
Mrs McEntee had four obstructed
labours, many years ago.

30:05.160 --> 30:06.959
Her babies were stillborn.

30:06.960 --> 30:11.159
But we can refer her for surgery
now, all free of charge.

30:11.160 --> 30:14.239
There's no need to attempt
a natural childbirth.

30:20.440 --> 30:22.799
I'm... I'm sorry.

30:22.800 --> 30:27.399
It's just that... that, well,
things come back, you know.

30:27.400 --> 30:29.919
Did you hear Doctor, Brenda?

30:29.920 --> 30:33.799
This a brand-new baby,
and a splendid chance for you.

30:33.800 --> 30:37.359
We're all here to help, and Doctor's
going to help most of all.

30:37.360 --> 30:39.839
I... I know.

30:39.840 --> 30:42.279
I... I'm making a show of myself.

30:42.280 --> 30:44.599
Not at all.

30:44.600 --> 30:48.240
Now, let's start by letting him
look at that old tummy.

30:55.080 --> 30:57.119
Look out!

31:06.833 --> 31:09.195
I hope you take greater care
of the babies.

31:09.196 --> 31:11.240
They're not quite
so easily replaced.

31:24.560 --> 31:26.759
Well done.

31:26.760 --> 31:29.399
You made Brenda McEntee feel safe.

31:29.400 --> 31:32.759
Magic handkerchief.
Never known to fail. No.

31:32.760 --> 31:36.279
You made her feel safe.
It's the mark of a good nurse.

31:36.280 --> 31:38.719
A midwife too.

31:38.720 --> 31:42.919
Everything else is just mechanics.
You'll soon get the hang of it.

31:42.920 --> 31:45.439
Do you think so?

31:45.440 --> 31:47.360
Yes, I do.

33:05.840 --> 33:08.399
We like to hold refresher classes
when we can.

33:08.400 --> 33:10.759
Some complications come up
only rarely,

33:10.760 --> 33:13.160
and it's as well to stay
on top of all the theory.

33:13.161 --> 33:14.599
Now.

33:14.600 --> 33:19.439
Approximately 3 to 4% of babies
arriving at term are born breech.

33:19.440 --> 33:23.759
That is to say, the buttocks will
be the presenting part.

33:23.760 --> 33:27.039
Didn't Shakespeare describe
Richard III as being breech?

33:27.040 --> 33:31.359
Something about him coming into
the world with his legs forward?

33:31.360 --> 33:33.839
In Poplar they call it
arriving arse-first.

33:35.360 --> 33:37.879
Did anyone see any breech births
during training?

33:37.880 --> 33:41.039
I saw two. I saw one, the second
of a set of twins.

33:41.040 --> 33:43.839
Nurse Browne?

33:43.840 --> 33:47.159
I did and I didn't.

33:47.160 --> 33:50.359
All tickety-boo to start with,
then after the legs descended,

33:50.360 --> 33:53.999
the midwife wrapped the baby in a
towel and let its body hang there.

33:54.000 --> 33:57.919
It was dangling. Still with its head
inside the birth canal.

33:57.920 --> 34:01.159
Yes. That is done to increase
the flexion of the head.

34:01.160 --> 34:03.319
It increases the risk
of asphyxiation.

34:03.320 --> 34:05.719
It is a showman's trick, in my view.

34:05.720 --> 34:08.799
How long was it allowed to hang?
I don't know.

34:08.800 --> 34:12.958
I passed out. Came to face down on
the lino in the corridor.

34:12.960 --> 34:16.998
Nurse Fortescue-Cholmeley-Browne!

34:17.000 --> 34:21.958
According to the duty log, you were
late for your first three appointments,

34:21.960 --> 34:23.998
and missed the last two altogether!

34:24.000 --> 34:26.799
Chummy wrote those entries
in the log herself!

34:26.800 --> 34:30.559
As if it's something to be proud of?
Chummy has to walk everywhere.

34:30.560 --> 34:32.958
Then why isn't she doing
something about it?

34:32.960 --> 34:36.759
"Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks!

34:36.760 --> 34:40.199
"Rage! Blow!
Ye cataracts and hurricanes, spout".

34:40.199 --> 34:41.639
Sister Monica Joan...

34:41.639 --> 34:45.440
I refer to the fact...
that her nose is running.

34:46.760 --> 34:48.319
Here you are.

34:48.320 --> 34:51.719
You need to have more respect
for your patients.

34:51.719 --> 34:53.998
If you can't be trusted
to turn up on time,

34:54.000 --> 34:56.239
you can't be trusted to do
your own deliveries,

34:56.239 --> 34:58.880
no matter how much studying you do.

35:17.680 --> 35:20.959
I love it every time it kicks.

35:20.960 --> 35:24.919
All I can think is,
"Please let it be born strong."

35:24.920 --> 35:28.839
Everything else can wait till later.
Quite right. You need to keep rested

35:28.840 --> 35:30.480
and eat as much as you can.

35:31.960 --> 35:34.480
That's it. Perfect.

35:35.480 --> 35:39.519
I could get used to perfect.
I can't get used to them fig rolls.

35:39.520 --> 35:42.239
They'll do you good.
They've got fruit in.

35:42.240 --> 35:47.079
The night I met Zakir, he gave me
chocolate cake with fruit in.

35:47.080 --> 35:51.319
He'd given me wine to drink,
and I hadn't liked it.

35:51.320 --> 35:54.399
The cake was supposed
to make the wine taste sweeter,

35:54.400 --> 35:57.239
but it only made it taste more sour.

35:57.240 --> 36:01.479
You can open the curtains now, Mary.
I've finished examining you.

36:01.480 --> 36:05.360
It was after that
that he took me to the Crystal Room.

36:09.600 --> 36:12.840
I knew what men did to women.

36:13.840 --> 36:15.920
I'd had it done to me.

36:17.000 --> 36:20.720
And... I didn't think
it could be beautiful...

36:22.640 --> 36:25.439
or that it could happen
on a bed with golden sheets.

36:25.440 --> 36:28.279
Mary.
He said afterwards,

36:28.280 --> 36:30.853
"Did you think anything like that
could ever come to you?"

36:32.640 --> 36:35.079
As if he knew
I'd never known it could.

36:35.080 --> 36:37.399
Mary.

36:37.400 --> 36:41.009
What Zakir did to you
was obscene, not beautiful.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.559
You shouldn't speak of him.
You shouldn't think of him.

36:44.560 --> 36:45.962
I can't help it.

36:48.880 --> 36:50.480
He's standing in the street.

36:54.897 --> 36:57.408
He comes and stands there
every afternoon.

37:01.000 --> 37:05.799
I don't care how many calls I have to
make or how far we have to send her.

37:05.800 --> 37:08.041
But I am going to get her
out of Stepney.

37:09.355 --> 37:12.712
She's younger than most,
she's not sharp in the head,

37:12.756 --> 37:15.716
and she's valuable to them
on both those counts.

37:17.960 --> 37:19.400
Right.

37:21.040 --> 37:23.199
'A place was found for Mary

37:23.200 --> 37:27.039
'at a Catholic mother-and-baby
home in Kent.

37:27.040 --> 37:29.239
'She would be cared for there,

37:29.240 --> 37:32.919
'with her child delivered
in the cottage hospital.'

37:32.920 --> 37:36.400
Thank you for being my friend,
Jenny Lee.

37:52.760 --> 37:55.439
Well done, Chummy!

37:55.440 --> 37:59.599
We're going to go straight ahead and
turn right into Lisbon Street.

37:59.600 --> 38:02.839
Don't forget your hand signals.
I just stick out my arm, don't I?

38:02.840 --> 38:05.319
Medal for that woman!

38:05.320 --> 38:07.480
Slow down now, Chum!

38:08.880 --> 38:10.559
How?

38:10.560 --> 38:13.679
Lean in as you turn.
I don't know how to turn.

38:13.680 --> 38:15.439
I've forgotten how to turn!

38:17.440 --> 38:19.719
Brake! Brake, Nurse!

38:21.720 --> 38:23.959
What happened?
They were going too fast.

38:26.560 --> 38:28.599
All right? That's it.

38:28.600 --> 38:31.239
You all right, nurse?

38:31.240 --> 38:32.799
I think so.

38:32.800 --> 38:37.079
All right, darling? All right,
take it easy. Anything hurt?

38:37.080 --> 38:39.679
Dear, I'm such a fool. Sorry.

38:39.680 --> 38:41.720
Just take a minute.

38:48.960 --> 38:53.014
First, I'm glad that none of you
are more seriously injured,

38:54.000 --> 38:57.559
and, second, that you aren't
all up before the magistrates.

38:57.560 --> 39:01.599
How did you persuade the policeman
not to charge you?

39:01.600 --> 39:04.239
Assaulting an officer
is a criminal offence.

39:04.240 --> 39:08.679
I can't remember. I just tried
to say it as nicely as I could.

39:08.680 --> 39:13.439
"Sweet voice, sweet lips,
soft hand, and softer breast,

39:14.119 --> 39:19.431
"Warm breath, light whisper,
tender semi-tone."

39:20.600 --> 39:25.119
Not even the softness of the breast
or any other portion of the form

39:25.120 --> 39:27.999
helped to turn away the policeman's
wrath.

39:28.000 --> 39:29.679
I don't care if they did.

39:29.680 --> 39:33.519
Nurse Fortescue-Cholmeley-Browne
has got off scot-free,

39:33.520 --> 39:36.239
we're short-staffed
and our patients will suffer.

39:36.240 --> 39:40.559
Nurse Browne was diagnosed
with shock and mild concussion.

39:40.560 --> 39:43.480
After bed rest, she
will recover and then

39:43.481 --> 39:46.399
she'll be attending
deliveries by herself.

39:46.400 --> 39:47.879
She's not competent!

39:47.880 --> 39:51.519
Cycling aside,
she's competent enough.

39:51.520 --> 39:55.319
She is a qualified midwife
and a highly experienced nurse.

39:55.320 --> 39:57.359
There's experience and experience.

39:57.360 --> 40:00.079
What experience has she got
of ordinary people?

40:00.080 --> 40:03.959
What experience have they
got of her? They like her.

40:03.960 --> 40:05.999
They laugh at her.

40:06.000 --> 40:09.959
And they've every right.
She's no better than a tourist.

40:09.960 --> 40:12.599
She's using them for her own ends.

40:12.600 --> 40:15.040
The East End's nothing
but a stepping stone to her.

40:15.041 --> 40:18.199
What if it's the stepping stone
to her life's work?

40:18.200 --> 40:20.839
This is our life's work.

40:20.840 --> 40:23.959
We don't need Madame Lah-di-dah
looking down on us

40:23.960 --> 40:27.199
from her... her great height!

40:27.200 --> 40:28.999
Nurse Browne!

40:29.000 --> 40:33.239
- What are you doing out of bed?
- I've been to the off-licence.

40:33.240 --> 40:37.599
To buy some whisky
for the policeman.

40:37.600 --> 40:42.080
I asked if they had the Glenlivet,
but they'd never heard of it.

41:10.880 --> 41:12.920
I called her Kathleen.

41:14.400 --> 41:16.360
It means pure.

41:25.480 --> 41:28.039
It's a shame you gave
that Scotch to the bobby.

41:28.040 --> 41:31.200
You could have done
with a nip tonight.

41:34.640 --> 41:36.480
Do you suppose this
is how fighter pilots

41:36.481 --> 41:38.319
felt, waiting for
the call to fly?

41:38.320 --> 41:41.799
I dunno. I was an Army man myself.
Pioneer Corps.

41:41.800 --> 41:43.879
Gosh. One of the glamour boys?

41:43.880 --> 41:47.199
Well, I specialised in lavatories.

41:47.200 --> 41:49.599
It's a myth that an army
marches on its stomach.

41:49.600 --> 41:52.000
What a fighting man needs
is a top-notch khazi...

41:52.001 --> 41:55.919
..and not to panic.

41:55.920 --> 41:59.039
Like Monty said at El Alamein,

41:59.040 --> 42:01.680
"It can be done,
and it will be done!"

42:07.920 --> 42:09.679
Nonnatus House. Midwife speaking.

42:09.680 --> 42:13.719
My daughter's waters went when
they cut the wedding cake!

42:13.720 --> 42:16.399
Is the lady in labour the
bride? Bride's mother.

42:16.400 --> 42:21.319
I'd hurry. This is her fifth,
and she don't half have 'em fast!

42:21.320 --> 42:23.479
I looked in the book.

42:23.480 --> 42:28.000
She's two weeks before her due date
so nothing's been sent on ahead!

42:33.000 --> 42:34.240
Thank you.

42:35.760 --> 42:38.879
You put a nip of something in it.

42:38.880 --> 42:41.519
Army trick.
Before going into battle?

42:41.520 --> 42:44.040
Before going
into the other ranks' latrines.

43:28.961 --> 43:32.279
Watch it! Look out!

43:32.280 --> 43:34.679
Get out the way!

43:37.480 --> 43:40.319
Here! I will not have you
giving cheek!

43:40.320 --> 43:43.719
Especially to the nurse
who's come to help your mum.

43:43.720 --> 43:46.079
Here! What you walloping him for?

43:46.080 --> 43:47.599
Disrespect.

43:47.600 --> 43:49.879
Come here.

43:49.880 --> 43:53.840
I know your wallops.
You're too soft on him.

43:55.800 --> 43:58.479
The midwife had a moustache.

44:00.560 --> 44:02.719
She kept bending down
between my knees

44:02.720 --> 44:05.560
and looking where I don't like
being looked at.

44:07.120 --> 44:09.000
I yelled a little bit.

44:10.880 --> 44:14.359
She kept on saying, "Nearly over.

44:14.360 --> 44:17.039
"Nearly over."

44:17.040 --> 44:20.440
And all I kept thinking was,
"It's nearly starting.

44:21.600 --> 44:24.320
"I'm nearly a mam."

44:25.320 --> 44:28.800
What was it like
when you saw her face?

44:30.320 --> 44:32.800
Like I'd been missing her
my whole life.

44:40.600 --> 44:42.919
That's the girl! Let it rip.

44:42.920 --> 44:46.239
They're singing Old MacDonald now
so no-one can hear you.

44:46.240 --> 44:49.319
Now, after your contraction,
I'll carry out an examination,

44:49.320 --> 44:51.559
and we'll see how close
to delivery you are.

44:51.560 --> 44:54.519
I hope it's born before the party
ends.

44:54.520 --> 44:57.399
Be a right lark, making an
announcement!

44:57.400 --> 44:59.800
I don't want no attention
being drawn to this, Mum!

44:59.801 --> 45:02.719
I'm 42. It makes me look loose.

45:02.720 --> 45:04.839
It makes him indoors look loose.

45:04.840 --> 45:07.199
You should have made him
take up dominoes.

45:07.200 --> 45:09.279
Oi! My tortoise is under that bed!

45:09.280 --> 45:12.719
It went into early hibernation.
Well, he won't wake up.

45:12.720 --> 45:16.599
All tortoises are deaf.
Now, come on. Shoo.

45:16.600 --> 45:18.759
Come on, out you go.

45:21.280 --> 45:24.400
This is happening too fast.
I haven't even had my enema yet.

45:37.560 --> 45:40.119
Everything in order, Nurse?

45:40.120 --> 45:42.999
It would seem, Betty, as though
your baby

45:43.000 --> 45:45.759
is presenting in the breech position.

45:45.760 --> 45:47.679
You what?

45:47.680 --> 45:50.599
It's coming out arse-first.

45:50.600 --> 45:54.279
That's bad.
She's not quite fully dilated.

45:54.280 --> 45:56.799
So, there's time
to transfer her to hospital,

45:56.800 --> 45:59.199
where she might feel
a little more secure.

45:59.200 --> 46:01.520
I feel secure here!
I want to stay in my own bed.

46:01.521 --> 46:05.639
And it's not like
you're one of them slips of girls.

46:05.640 --> 46:09.679
Betty's had all hers delivered
by Nonnatus, just like I had mine.

46:09.680 --> 46:12.519
Mum. Quick, get the bowl.

46:15.920 --> 46:19.159
She's moving on, Nurse.
She's getting ready to want it out.

46:19.160 --> 46:21.720
I shall be back in precisely
one moment.

46:50.560 --> 46:53.119
Stop!

46:53.120 --> 46:56.079
I want all the children
to go downstairs.

46:56.080 --> 46:57.519
Apart from Jack.

46:57.520 --> 47:00.839
Jack, I need you to go to the
telephone and ring Nonnatus House.

47:00.840 --> 47:04.159
That's Poplar 459.
Tell them the baby is breech.

47:04.160 --> 47:05.719
What's that mean?

47:05.720 --> 47:08.439
Just say "breech"
to whoever answers the telephone.

47:08.440 --> 47:11.999
It's like the beach, the seaside.
But it's got an R in it.

47:12.000 --> 47:15.160
Tell them we need additional support.
Go!

47:19.760 --> 47:24.519
Betty. Betty, listen to me.
I need you to change position.

47:24.520 --> 47:26.839
What?
I need you with your bottom

47:26.840 --> 47:29.879
right at the edge of the bed.
I can't move.

47:29.880 --> 47:34.895
I'm sorry. I know it's a rotten
business. But I do know the form.

47:52.600 --> 47:54.359
Nonnatus House?

47:54.360 --> 47:55.599
Well done.

47:55.600 --> 47:59.519
I can feel your hand. It's shaking.

47:59.520 --> 48:02.640
It's excitement. I'm always the same.

48:09.640 --> 48:13.479
Whoa!
Can I sit with you?

48:13.480 --> 48:15.999
I told them to keep on dancing.

48:16.000 --> 48:19.280
I told them your mum says
the noise is a help.

48:20.520 --> 48:23.959
Now, Betty. I'm sure you want
to push like billy-o.

48:23.960 --> 48:26.919
But I need this baby

48:26.920 --> 48:28.999
to come very, very slowly.

48:29.000 --> 48:32.199
So... pant.

48:32.200 --> 48:35.440
Pant, pant.

48:37.480 --> 48:39.159
Little push.

48:39.160 --> 48:42.119
Little push. Stop.

48:43.600 --> 48:46.359
Bravo.

48:46.360 --> 48:49.759
Little push. Little push.

48:49.760 --> 48:52.319
Little push. Stop.

48:54.600 --> 48:56.759
Bravo, Betty.

48:56.760 --> 48:59.799
Your baby's bottom is now delivered.

48:59.800 --> 49:02.679
Now,

49:02.680 --> 49:05.639
I need you to stay very still.

49:05.640 --> 49:08.800
Breathe very calmly...

49:10.200 --> 49:12.760
as I hook my fingers...

49:14.080 --> 49:16.799
over her legs

49:16.800 --> 49:19.160
and bring them into the world.

49:25.760 --> 49:28.999
Have you done it yet?

49:29.000 --> 49:31.439
We're doing this together.
Yeah.

49:38.840 --> 49:41.960
Here, your hand's
not shaking no more.

49:47.840 --> 49:51.520
Now, Betty, I'm going to wrap
the baby in a towel.

49:54.400 --> 49:57.359
Her head is still inside
the birth canal,

49:57.360 --> 50:02.399
and, if she becomes cold, she may
gasp, which... would be unfortunate.

50:05.000 --> 50:07.879
Now, with the next contraction,

50:07.880 --> 50:11.440
you will feel the baby move, as I
turn her just a quarter circle.

50:13.280 --> 50:15.876
That will help ease
the shoulders out.

50:31.827 --> 50:33.165
Well done.

50:46.240 --> 50:48.559
She should have called you direct.

50:48.560 --> 50:51.959
Doctor is always called for
in the case of a breech.

50:51.960 --> 50:54.679
You called for me.
Now we're both here.

50:54.680 --> 50:58.039
Now, Betty,
I don't want you to move a muscle.

51:00.800 --> 51:03.920
I'm going to loosen my hand
on Baby...

51:05.560 --> 51:07.157
and let her body hang.

51:22.680 --> 51:26.359
Not a muscle, Betty. Can we have
quiet for the mother, please?

51:26.360 --> 51:28.479
Why are you holding back?
It looks to me

51:28.480 --> 51:31.279
as though Nurse is managing
things beautifully.

51:32.320 --> 51:35.119
Now, old thing.

51:35.120 --> 51:36.759
Push.

51:41.600 --> 51:43.999
Keep it coming.

51:44.000 --> 51:46.559
Keep it coming.

51:48.560 --> 51:50.399
That's it.

51:50.400 --> 51:54.079
Keep it coming. Keep it coming.

52:10.880 --> 52:12.639
Hello.

52:12.640 --> 52:15.080
My baby.

52:16.520 --> 52:19.340
Come on, you big girl's blouse.

52:21.120 --> 52:24.679
It's only a baby being born.

52:36.120 --> 52:39.280
You're all right.

52:42.440 --> 52:44.000
Thank you.

52:53.080 --> 52:56.240
Gone to sleep already.
Just like her dad.

53:36.400 --> 53:38.320
Kathleen!

53:41.480 --> 53:43.080
Kathleen!

53:44.400 --> 53:47.319
Kathleen!

53:50.480 --> 53:52.600
Kathleen!

53:53.720 --> 53:56.160
Kathleen!

53:57.680 --> 53:59.760
Jenny Lee.

54:03.120 --> 54:05.560
Do you know where my baby is?

54:08.360 --> 54:10.640
She needs me to feed her!

54:19.000 --> 54:21.359
She has abscesses in both breasts!

54:21.360 --> 54:24.039
Isn't her mental agony
enough for them?

54:24.040 --> 54:27.039
Babies are always placed
for adoption in these cases.

54:27.040 --> 54:29.360
It's thought to be
in the child's best interests.

54:29.361 --> 54:33.439
What about Mary's interests? She's
the mother, she did not consent!

54:33.440 --> 54:35.400
Nurse Lee.

54:36.960 --> 54:38.840
She can't consent.

54:39.920 --> 54:43.479
She's only 15,
still legally a child herself.

54:43.480 --> 54:46.919
It was a case
of which child should we choose.

54:46.920 --> 54:51.919
How can a girl of 15
with no home, no education,

54:51.920 --> 54:55.039
no trade other than that of
prostitution, bring up a baby?

54:55.040 --> 54:57.079
She gave up prostitution.

54:57.080 --> 55:01.760
She doesn't have that choice. And
you're not the only one who's angry!

55:07.960 --> 55:10.239
But you're young.

55:10.240 --> 55:12.119
You can be angry in the abstract,

55:12.120 --> 55:15.519
and our Lord will love you
for your righteous indignation.

55:15.520 --> 55:18.199
Even while Mary's
condemned as a sinner?

55:18.200 --> 55:21.279
God forgives. The Church forgives.

55:21.280 --> 55:25.359
The Church took her baby.
I think it will kill her.

55:25.360 --> 55:28.919
Without a baby, Mary is employable.

55:28.920 --> 55:31.559
She could find love.

55:31.560 --> 55:34.159
She could have another child.

55:34.160 --> 55:36.639
And you think that will console her?

55:36.640 --> 55:38.520
It consoles me.

55:48.960 --> 55:52.199
Your milk ducts have
become blocked, Mary.

55:52.200 --> 55:54.439
That's the cause of the infection.

55:54.440 --> 55:56.999
It hurts.

55:57.000 --> 55:59.840
It hurts like I never knew
hurt could hurt.

56:02.200 --> 56:05.119
Reverend Mother has sent
for the doctor.

56:05.120 --> 56:08.399
He'll prescribe you antibiotics.

56:08.400 --> 56:11.479
In the meantime,
I'm going to bind your breasts

56:11.480 --> 56:13.839
so we can help stop
the flow of milk.

56:13.840 --> 56:17.720
I don't want it stopped.
It's Kathleen's.

56:25.800 --> 56:27.160
Can I use this?

56:45.520 --> 56:49.559
'Mary was never reunited
with her child.

56:49.560 --> 56:54.320
'She might look for her, but her name
would not be Kathleen any more.'

57:12.888 --> 57:15.799
Jack became Chummy's
devoted guardian.

57:15.800 --> 57:18.879
Never taunted again by any
passer-by,

57:18.880 --> 57:22.200
she finally mastered
the art of the bike.

57:28.360 --> 57:30.479
All right, Constable?

57:30.480 --> 57:34.879
Unused to such kindness, Chummy
bought him a bicycle

57:34.880 --> 57:37.720
from her generous private funds.

57:41.720 --> 57:45.479
Brenda McEntee delivered a daughter
by the Caesarean section

57:45.480 --> 57:48.800
that could have saved
each of her stillborn children.

57:51.600 --> 57:55.959
The National Health Service
gave her the gift of motherhood.

57:57.350 --> 58:00.949
She called her child Grace Miracle.

58:02.000 --> 58:04.560
And she was perfect.

58:07.360 --> 58:10.839
Jimmy? What are you doing here?
I'm in a tight spot, Jenny.

58:10.840 --> 58:14.639
Don't worry, Nurse Lee,
I shan't go telling any tales,

58:14.640 --> 58:18.079
I had a few overnight guests
of my own.

58:18.080 --> 58:20.919
You look well.
And you. Very well.

58:20.920 --> 58:23.279
As do you.

58:23.280 --> 58:26.719
It's not right, Mr Collett. They
can't make you leave your own home.

58:26.720 --> 58:30.839
Don't cry over an old codger
like myself.

58:30.840 --> 58:32.720
I'm scared! We're going to take good
care of you.

58:32.721 --> 58:34.479
Don't worry.

58:34.480 --> 58:37.279
You don't understand! I'm scared!

58:37.280 --> 58:39.280
What are you so afraid of, Mrs Luce?
