WEBVTT

00:06.620 --> 00:07.290
- Previously, on "Happy!"...

00:08.560 --> 00:09.690
- Ah!

00:09.730 --> 00:11.360
- You're not a hallucination,

00:11.400 --> 00:12.630
you're not my subconscious
trying to gyrate me

00:12.660 --> 00:14.160
for all my past sins.

00:14.200 --> 00:15.570
There's probably a little
girl somewhere out there

00:15.600 --> 00:16.730
who needs her daddy.
I ain't him.

00:16.770 --> 00:18.100
- You are him.

00:18.140 --> 00:19.440
- Who are you?

00:19.470 --> 00:20.470
- Hailey Hansen.

00:20.500 --> 00:22.610
They took me away from my mom.

00:22.640 --> 00:24.370
I miss her.
- I need your help.

00:24.410 --> 00:26.180
Someone kidnapped my daughter.

00:26.210 --> 00:27.510
You owe me.

00:27.540 --> 00:29.710
- I don't owe you
anything at all.

00:29.750 --> 00:31.850
- Nick Sax has got my password.

00:31.880 --> 00:35.120
The only man you ever loved
broke up his marriage.

00:35.150 --> 00:36.850
- Wait a minute,
were you two--

00:36.890 --> 00:38.290
I'm gonna lose my lunch.

00:38.320 --> 00:40.720
- I bring you Sax,
and we're even.

00:42.490 --> 00:44.260
- I saw what you did
to all those bad guys, Nick.

00:44.290 --> 00:46.300
If you can do that,
you can save Hailey.

00:46.330 --> 00:48.330
That picture of you
that Hailey saw was real.

00:48.370 --> 00:49.770
You were a hero once.

00:49.800 --> 00:51.640
I guess that's why
you hate yourself.

00:51.670 --> 00:53.300
- Come on,
let's go find this kid.

00:53.340 --> 00:55.510
- My dad's coming.
He's a hero.

00:55.540 --> 00:59.640
He's gonna find Santa and he's
gonna put him in jail forever.

00:59.680 --> 01:02.650
- What if
Santa finds your daddy first?

01:08.820 --> 01:10.350
Hey!

01:10.390 --> 01:12.120
- I'm the only one
who can hear that.

01:12.160 --> 01:14.120
Yeah.

01:14.160 --> 01:16.230
I'm not sure
I follow your point, Nick.

01:16.260 --> 01:18.760
- You know this
shtick of yours--

01:18.800 --> 01:21.230
the songs, the corny lines,

01:21.270 --> 01:24.270
the zany "aw shucks"
vaudeville routine?

01:24.300 --> 01:25.740
It's not cute.

01:25.770 --> 01:27.170
It's not funny.

01:27.200 --> 01:29.440
Hailey thinks
I'm cute and funny.

01:29.470 --> 01:30.810
- Hey,
do you ever stop to think

01:30.840 --> 01:32.910
maybe she didn't really
send you off to find me?

01:32.940 --> 01:34.410
Maybe she wanted
to get rid of you.

01:34.440 --> 01:37.510
Trying to get rid...

01:37.550 --> 01:39.750
That's--uhh.

01:39.780 --> 01:41.720
That...

01:41.750 --> 01:43.350
That is not true.

01:43.390 --> 01:45.660
I'm an absolutely delightful
little ball of funshine.

01:45.690 --> 01:47.460
- I've known you
less than 24 hours.

01:47.490 --> 01:49.160
I already wanna kill
both of us with fire

01:49.190 --> 01:50.490
just to make it stop.

01:50.530 --> 01:52.660
Ooh, are we there yet?

01:54.730 --> 01:57.770
- I can't. Ugh.

01:59.340 --> 02:00.670
- Do I need to remind
you what happened

02:00.700 --> 02:02.740
the last time we took
our eyes off the road?

02:02.770 --> 02:05.380
- Okay.

02:05.410 --> 02:08.210
We're gonna play the quiet game
until we get off this bridge.

02:08.250 --> 02:09.550
- Oh, what's the quiet game?

02:09.580 --> 02:11.420
Usually Hailey and I
just play with apps.

02:11.450 --> 02:13.580
You know, games on the phone.

02:13.620 --> 02:15.620
Oh, maybe you should
use Google Maps, Nick.

02:15.650 --> 02:16.650
Amanda uses Google Maps.

02:16.690 --> 02:18.190
It tells you
the best route to take

02:18.220 --> 02:19.190
so you don't get
stuck in traffic.

02:19.220 --> 02:20.820
Also, it sounds funny.

02:20.860 --> 02:22.290
Google...

02:22.330 --> 02:24.690
Google. Google.

02:24.730 --> 02:25.900
L-O-L.

02:25.930 --> 02:27.430
What the heck?

02:27.460 --> 02:29.500
You can't get out
of the car on a bridge.

02:29.530 --> 02:32.570
- Oh.

02:32.600 --> 02:33.940
Ah.

02:40.540 --> 02:42.210
- What are you doing, Nick?

02:42.250 --> 02:44.710
Anyone ever tell you
about right and wrong?

02:44.750 --> 02:47.850
- Eh, there's a lot
of things nobody ever told me.

02:50.450 --> 02:53.860
Then again, I was never
much of a listener.

02:59.030 --> 03:00.700
- Look, I'm not
defending the guy.

03:00.730 --> 03:02.600
- Okay.
- I'm just saying--

03:02.630 --> 03:05.670
this piece of shit's not
worth us losing our jobs over.

03:05.700 --> 03:07.500
- Just take a walk.
grab a Falafel.

03:07.540 --> 03:09.570
It won't take you long.
- You know I can't do that.

03:09.610 --> 03:11.010
You're my goddamn partner.

03:11.040 --> 03:12.710
- Three domestic abuse
calls in the last week--

03:12.740 --> 03:14.410
that guy's beating
on that poor girl

03:14.440 --> 03:15.710
like Keith Moon at Woodstock

03:15.750 --> 03:17.380
and we're supposed
to turn the other way, why?

03:17.410 --> 03:19.780
Because he's some
rich asshole's lawyer?

03:20.950 --> 03:23.320
- You know, I think we got
our roles reversed here, Sax.

03:23.350 --> 03:24.550
You're supposed
to be the cynical,

03:24.590 --> 03:26.390
jaded vet who
plays by the rules,

03:26.420 --> 03:28.260
and I'm supposed
to be the idealistic,

03:28.290 --> 03:30.390
young rookie who just
can't accept that

03:30.430 --> 03:32.030
sometimes the bad guys
get away with shit.

03:33.500 --> 03:36.370
Like I said, Mer, Falafel.

03:36.400 --> 03:39.500
It's calling your name.

03:39.540 --> 03:40.670
All right, I'll tell you what.

03:40.700 --> 03:42.310
We knock on this door,
you be good cop,

03:42.340 --> 03:45.280
I be, you know, me.

03:45.310 --> 03:46.710
Stay close by,
make sure I don't do

03:46.740 --> 03:48.510
any permanent damage
to this asshole,

03:48.550 --> 03:51.380
and maybe we can both
manage to stay employed.

03:56.550 --> 03:58.860
- What the hell is this?

03:58.890 --> 04:00.760
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

04:04.530 --> 04:06.700
Wait, you're those cops
that showed up last week.

04:06.730 --> 04:08.600
Ah, Detective...

04:08.630 --> 04:10.430
Sax, right?
- That's right.

04:10.470 --> 04:12.570
- I thought I was very
specific, very specific--

04:12.600 --> 04:14.400
Shut that goddamn
thing's mouth, Coco,

04:14.440 --> 04:15.610
or I swear to Christ!

04:15.640 --> 04:17.440
Hey, hey,
come here, Detective.

04:17.470 --> 04:18.680
Let me talk to you a second.

04:18.709 --> 04:21.810
Come here,
between us boys, Sax.

04:21.850 --> 04:23.450
You know what it is?

04:23.480 --> 04:25.480
It starts out as a nice
little side piece, right?

04:25.520 --> 04:28.080
Swears up and down,
it's ok, I got the implant.

04:28.120 --> 04:29.720
Besides,
the last dude she was with--

04:29.750 --> 04:32.560
allegedly messed her up
so she can't, you know--

04:32.590 --> 04:34.490
next thing you know,
she's knocked up.

04:34.520 --> 04:35.860
Can you believe it?
I set her up in this place.

04:35.890 --> 04:37.830
Nice place, right?
No rent, furnished.

04:37.860 --> 04:39.900
All I expect is
when I want to come out

04:39.930 --> 04:41.500
this side of town and get off,

04:41.530 --> 04:43.830
I don't want any lip about it,
you understand?

04:43.870 --> 04:46.570
- Suppositories.

04:46.600 --> 04:48.000
New thing.

04:48.040 --> 04:50.370
Guys doing
speedballs up the ass.

04:50.410 --> 04:52.010
I say to myself,
what kind of douchebag

04:52.040 --> 04:53.740
would ever do
something like that?

04:55.140 --> 04:57.780
Now I see I'm looking
right at him, right?

05:00.420 --> 05:02.650
- I think something's getting
lost in translation here.

05:02.690 --> 05:05.360
- Do you?
- The men I associate with,

05:05.390 --> 05:06.720
the men I represent--

05:06.760 --> 05:08.860
I can literally take
your badge, Detective.

05:08.890 --> 05:10.590
I can just take it.

05:12.460 --> 05:15.800
- The men you associate with.

05:15.830 --> 05:18.700
- What, you wanna
lay hands on me?

05:18.740 --> 05:20.140
Do it.

05:20.170 --> 05:22.840
Do it, make it easy.

05:24.040 --> 05:25.510
- Let me be clear.

05:27.640 --> 05:32.020
Nothing gets
lost in translation.

05:32.050 --> 05:34.820
I am someone

05:34.850 --> 05:40.020
that you don't wanna
be associated with

05:40.060 --> 05:44.490
in any way, shape, or form.

05:44.530 --> 05:47.630
When I come back here,

05:47.660 --> 05:50.630
badge or no badge,

05:50.670 --> 05:53.570
I'm gonna take your head

05:53.600 --> 05:56.670
and shove it up your ass

05:56.710 --> 05:58.940
and use it like your mother's.

06:00.080 --> 06:01.140
Eh, maybe you're right.

06:02.810 --> 06:04.580
I could probably go
for an attitude adjustment.

06:06.050 --> 06:07.880
- I don't even know what
to say to you right now.

06:07.920 --> 06:09.950
- Then why don't you
tell me where we're going?

06:12.720 --> 06:14.090
Hailey. Where is she?

06:14.120 --> 06:15.530
- How the heck should I know?

06:15.560 --> 06:16.790
You're the detective.

06:16.830 --> 06:18.130
- You were with her, right?
- Yeah.

06:18.160 --> 06:19.860
- So where did he take you?

06:19.900 --> 06:20.900
- I don't know.

06:20.930 --> 06:21.900
- You don't know?

06:21.930 --> 06:24.770
- It was dark--
really dark.

06:24.800 --> 06:25.700
- How dark?

06:25.740 --> 06:29.210
- Really, really dark.

06:29.240 --> 06:32.580
And there was a hallway.

06:32.610 --> 06:35.210
And then we came
to a big room--

06:35.240 --> 06:37.750
a dirty, smelly room.

06:37.780 --> 06:39.580
There was junk everywhere,

06:39.620 --> 06:41.690
super old junk, Nick, like,

06:41.720 --> 06:44.550
like from when
you were little.

06:44.590 --> 06:46.220
And there were these boxes,

06:46.260 --> 06:48.990
big wooden boxes with holes.

06:49.030 --> 06:51.460
That's where he keeps them,
Nick.

06:51.500 --> 06:54.100
That's where
the monster keeps the kids.

07:01.140 --> 07:02.010
- There's only one
person who can save us.

07:03.010 --> 07:04.470
You know who he is,

07:04.510 --> 07:06.840
and you're the only one
who can find him.

07:06.880 --> 07:08.180
- I'm not leaving you.

07:08.210 --> 07:10.780
- You have to.
You have to find him.

07:10.810 --> 07:12.080
You have to
bring him back here.

07:12.120 --> 07:13.680
But Hailey, I don't even--

07:13.720 --> 07:15.220
- You can do it.

07:15.250 --> 07:17.790
Know why?

07:17.820 --> 07:20.560
Because I believe in you.

07:22.590 --> 07:24.560
- So, you see, Nick?
I can't let her down.

07:24.590 --> 07:25.960
- That's very heartwarming.
What about the guy?

07:26.000 --> 07:27.260
Tell me about the guy.

07:27.300 --> 07:28.260
- The guy?

07:28.300 --> 07:30.700
- The monster.

07:30.730 --> 07:32.000
Can you describe him?

07:34.240 --> 07:35.840
We're gonna go see
a friend of mine.

07:35.870 --> 07:37.010
He used to be
a police sketch artist

07:37.040 --> 07:38.580
back when I was
on the force.

07:38.610 --> 07:39.980
They had to let him go
because he got a little--

07:40.010 --> 07:41.280
ah, never mind
why they let him go.

07:41.310 --> 07:43.210
The guy's a pro,
and he owes me a solid.

07:43.250 --> 07:47.050
Now, this so-called
monster of yours--

07:47.080 --> 07:48.620
you're gonna tell me
what he looks like.

07:48.650 --> 07:51.720
I'm gonna tell him,
he's gonna draw it, capisce?

07:51.760 --> 07:53.590
- Oh, okay.
- All right.

07:53.620 --> 07:54.820
- Why are we doing this again?

07:54.860 --> 07:56.290
- How many times
are we gonna go over it?

07:56.330 --> 07:58.730
I need the picture so we know
who we're looking for.

07:58.760 --> 08:00.930
Right?
It's called police work.

08:00.960 --> 08:04.000
- Hmmm.

08:07.840 --> 08:09.070
- Cigs...

08:09.110 --> 08:11.010
Alcohol...

08:11.040 --> 08:14.180
And Drakkar Noir.

08:14.210 --> 08:16.310
That can only be one man.

08:18.920 --> 08:20.780
Nick Sax.
- Hey.

08:20.820 --> 08:22.820
- Damn.

08:22.850 --> 08:23.950
What happened to you?

08:23.990 --> 08:25.250
- I won the Powerball.

08:25.290 --> 08:27.290
Got a wardrobe upgrade,
quit drinking.

08:27.320 --> 08:29.030
Got myself a personal trainer.

08:29.060 --> 08:31.800
Yep, living the high life.

08:31.830 --> 08:33.000
You?

08:33.030 --> 08:35.770
- Same, same.
As you can see.

08:35.799 --> 08:36.929
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:36.970 --> 08:38.640
Hey, Emil,
I need a favor from you.

08:38.669 --> 08:39.900
If I give you a description,

08:39.940 --> 08:42.039
can you just sketch
something up for me?

08:42.070 --> 08:44.870
- Well, you know,

08:44.910 --> 08:46.010
it's not like the old days.

08:46.040 --> 08:47.780
- Yeah, I know, I see.

08:47.810 --> 08:49.550
Your work's really, um...

08:52.220 --> 08:53.050
Evolved.

08:53.080 --> 08:54.720
- That's not what I mean.

08:54.750 --> 08:57.990
These days,
it's gonna cost you 20 bucks.

09:00.820 --> 09:01.930
- You got yourself a deal.

09:01.960 --> 09:03.630
You--start describing.

09:03.660 --> 09:04.930
- Oh, let's see.

09:04.960 --> 09:07.600
He was super ugly.

09:07.630 --> 09:09.830
Like--like--
like if a sea monster

09:09.870 --> 09:12.000
and smog monster had a baby,

09:12.040 --> 09:15.610
and they dressed it up like
the Grinch in a big red coat,

09:15.640 --> 09:19.340
but he was all grown up--
oh, and not green.

09:22.850 --> 09:25.780
- Uh, big red suit.

09:25.820 --> 09:28.380
And ugly.

10:03.920 --> 10:06.220
- You were right.

10:08.190 --> 10:11.130
This morning...

10:11.160 --> 10:14.130
Entitled sons of bitches.

10:14.160 --> 10:16.770
Think they can
get away with anything.

10:20.170 --> 10:22.010
Yeah, Mer.

10:22.040 --> 10:23.910
Been around the block
a few times.

10:23.940 --> 10:26.280
See how these things pan out.

10:26.310 --> 10:28.140
Yeah, but Nick...

10:28.180 --> 10:30.680
It's easy to say,
why stick your neck out?

10:30.710 --> 10:32.420
She made her bed,
let her lie in it.

10:32.450 --> 10:34.150
But...guess if we're
not going to

10:34.180 --> 10:36.790
stick our necks out
for people like that,

10:36.820 --> 10:39.790
we've got no business
being cops, right?

10:39.820 --> 10:42.360
Couldn't have
said it better myself, Mer.

10:45.460 --> 10:46.900
You know, I'm glad we can have

10:46.930 --> 10:48.730
these little chats.

10:48.770 --> 10:50.770
Sometimes,
you know, you just

10:50.800 --> 10:52.470
need someone
to bounce shit off of.

10:52.500 --> 10:54.800
- That's right.

10:54.840 --> 10:56.810
Keeps you from going insane.

10:59.240 --> 11:01.140
Hey, screw IAB.

11:03.750 --> 11:06.080
I'll take the heat
for what happened today.

11:07.950 --> 11:10.250
- So sweet.
Wanna close that?

11:17.930 --> 11:19.060
- Morning, Detective.

11:25.870 --> 11:28.470
- So, assaulting a cop
in a police station.

11:28.500 --> 11:31.210
Probably not
your brightest move.

11:31.240 --> 11:32.940
And now you're locked up
in here instead of

11:32.980 --> 11:34.980
out there looking for your kid.
How's that feel?

11:35.010 --> 11:36.180
- How's that eye feel?

11:36.210 --> 11:37.410
- Not to mention
you took the shot

11:37.450 --> 11:39.480
at one cop
in this entire building

11:39.520 --> 11:41.150
who might actually
be able to help you.

11:41.180 --> 11:43.320
- Oh, you're gonna help me?

11:43.350 --> 11:46.320
There isn't an
honest cop in this place.

11:51.130 --> 11:53.330
- These came to

11:53.360 --> 11:55.100
the parents of the other
missing children.

11:55.130 --> 11:56.970
Christmas cards.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.040
Guess I don't have to ask
if they look familiar.

11:59.070 --> 12:00.800
- No ransom demand.
Nothing. Why?

12:00.840 --> 12:02.840
- Maybe these sick bastards
get as much of a thrill

12:02.870 --> 12:05.780
out of torturing the parents
as they do the kids.

12:07.240 --> 12:09.350
Penny Baker--

12:09.380 --> 12:12.780
reported missing
late yesterday.

12:12.820 --> 12:14.180
No card yet?

12:14.220 --> 12:15.450
Any cop worth his shit

12:15.480 --> 12:17.220
might go out there,
stake him out--

12:17.250 --> 12:18.990
- See if they get a card.

12:19.020 --> 12:22.160
- And who brings it.

12:29.500 --> 12:31.300
Turn around.

12:37.610 --> 12:40.040
The kid, Hailey.

12:40.080 --> 12:42.310
Is it Sax's?

12:45.880 --> 12:47.920
- Does it matter?

12:51.920 --> 12:53.820
- You could've
just said Santa Claus.

12:53.860 --> 12:55.060
- Santa Claus, huh?

12:55.090 --> 12:57.230
- Oh! Th-That's him.

12:57.260 --> 12:58.460
That's the guy.

12:58.490 --> 13:00.000
- Sorry I wasted your time,
Emil.

13:00.030 --> 13:01.330
- Not wasting my time at all.

13:01.360 --> 13:03.070
That'll be 20 bucks, Nick.

13:12.280 --> 13:14.310
It's yours.

13:14.340 --> 13:16.380
Hey, Sax.
- What?

13:16.410 --> 13:19.420
- Them voices?

13:19.450 --> 13:21.620
I hear 'em too.

13:29.130 --> 13:30.990
- Where are you taking me?

13:33.330 --> 13:36.100
- ♪ Toyland

13:36.130 --> 13:38.430

13:38.470 --> 13:42.610

I got it, just, please,

14:06.030 --> 14:07.600
don't sing that
or anything else ever again.

14:07.630 --> 14:10.430
But I need you to dig into
that pea-sized head of yours.

14:10.470 --> 14:12.300
You gotta give me
something about this guy.

14:12.340 --> 14:14.940
A lisp? A limp?

14:14.970 --> 14:16.910
- A smell.

14:16.940 --> 14:20.940
A funny smell, like,
like plastic burning?

14:20.980 --> 14:23.280
But sweet.

14:23.310 --> 14:25.150
- Hmm...

14:25.180 --> 14:27.150
I know that smell.

14:27.180 --> 14:28.550
Meth.

14:29.720 --> 14:31.250
- What--was that bad?

14:32.560 --> 14:34.460
- Well, it ain't good.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.560
Eh, in hindsight, I guess
we could've picked

14:40.600 --> 14:42.200
a less conspicuous ride.

14:42.230 --> 14:44.300
- I told you we shouldn't
have cheated at cards.

14:44.330 --> 14:46.340
- Oh, yeah, that might be the
reason why they're after us.

14:46.370 --> 14:47.500
Oh.

14:49.070 --> 14:50.410
It could be that
we're driving a stolen car,

14:50.440 --> 14:52.980
with stolen guns
in the trunk, or...

14:53.010 --> 14:55.180
it could be the three
dead bodies at Le Dic's.

14:56.350 --> 14:57.710
Or the however many dead bodies

14:57.750 --> 14:59.320
we left back at that hospital.

14:59.350 --> 15:00.620
To tell you the truth,
all this excitement--

15:00.650 --> 15:02.520
I've kind of lost track.

15:02.550 --> 15:05.190
- Or not leaving 20%
at breakfast.

15:31.310 --> 15:32.620
- I don't wanna be mean,

15:32.650 --> 15:35.380
but you are really,
really bad at driving.

15:35.420 --> 15:36.690
- Disagree.

15:36.720 --> 15:38.420
Look at all
the traffic we avoided.

15:38.450 --> 15:39.990
We didn't need
Google Maps.

15:40.020 --> 15:41.220
- Nick!

15:41.260 --> 15:43.730
I wanna remind you that a
little girl's life is at stake.

15:43.760 --> 15:45.490
- Merry Christmas.

15:46.530 --> 15:48.260
You know something?

15:48.300 --> 15:50.730
You need to relax, calm down,

15:50.770 --> 15:52.740
and get into
the Christmas spirit.

15:52.770 --> 15:56.340
Be cheerful.
Besides, like I said...

15:56.370 --> 15:58.370
I got an idea.

16:12.460 --> 16:15.520
And that porridge
is just right.

16:15.560 --> 16:17.530
What the hell--Sax!

16:17.560 --> 16:21.100
- Oh,
the teddy bear talked, Nick.

16:21.130 --> 16:22.530
- That's the second job
in a row I did for free

16:22.570 --> 16:23.670
because you can't
learn to knock.

16:23.700 --> 16:25.100
- Well, to be fair,

16:25.130 --> 16:26.440
you did leave
both half finished.

16:26.470 --> 16:27.740
- That's so not funny.

16:29.570 --> 16:33.740
These must be the magic carrots
that make the reindeer fly.

16:33.780 --> 16:35.410
- Look, I'll be happy
to pay you

16:35.440 --> 16:36.680
for your, uh, business losses.

16:36.710 --> 16:38.180
I just need
a little help from you.

16:38.210 --> 16:39.580
- The last time
you needed my help,

16:39.620 --> 16:40.650
I ended up wearing
four dead guys.

16:40.680 --> 16:41.720
- This is totally different.

16:41.750 --> 16:43.290
I'm just looking for someone.

16:43.320 --> 16:44.820
Santa fetish, meth head.

16:44.850 --> 16:47.160
Looks like he was dipped
in honey, rolled in garbage.

16:47.190 --> 16:48.820
Likes little kids.
- Yeah, um...

16:48.860 --> 16:50.360
I don't do Santas.

16:50.390 --> 16:51.690
I had a pervy uncle,

16:51.730 --> 16:54.530
used to dress like
Santa every Christmas.

16:54.560 --> 16:56.170
I think he was my uncle.

16:57.670 --> 16:59.240
I don't wanna
talk about it, okay?

16:59.270 --> 17:02.170
- Sure, we all gotta
draw the line somewhere.

17:02.210 --> 17:05.069
Still, something tells me
you know where to find

17:05.109 --> 17:08.480
some holly jolly freaks...

17:08.510 --> 17:10.450
don't you, Angel?

17:12.480 --> 17:13.720
- Yeah, sure.

17:13.750 --> 17:15.380
I know where to find them.

street Santas,

17:58.660 --> 18:00.260
you know, bell ringers.

18:00.300 --> 18:02.900
It's a place they can hang out
and unwind, judgment free.

18:02.930 --> 18:05.370
It's a stressful job, you know.

18:05.400 --> 18:07.770
So, you gonna order something,
or are we just fast friends?

18:07.800 --> 18:09.240
- Whiskey.

Bottom shelf.

18:10.570 --> 18:12.380
Don't pollute it.

18:14.410 --> 18:16.850
- You can have all
the cherries you want?

18:16.880 --> 18:18.480
- You're goddamn right.

18:18.510 --> 18:19.920
Wait a minute.

18:19.950 --> 18:22.490
Your kind--you can eat?

18:22.520 --> 18:24.650

all right,

18:25.850 --> 18:27.190

18:34.300 --> 18:35.600
Mmm.

18:35.630 --> 18:37.230
Wait.

18:37.270 --> 18:38.670

Are you crying?

18:47.580 --> 18:48.680

- Clearly.

19:30.690 --> 19:32.460
- First,
get nice and lubricated,

19:32.490 --> 19:35.520
take the edge off,
straighten out my head.

Lost their kid at Roosevelt
Field Shopping Center.

19:45.770 --> 19:46.900
- Right.

19:46.940 --> 19:48.470
She was taken.

You think this is my fault?

19:52.910 --> 19:54.280
No.

19:55.980 --> 19:57.880
- We were at Bryant Park

19:57.910 --> 20:00.880
seeing Sonny Shine,
you know, the three wishes guy.

20:00.920 --> 20:03.520
I was holding her hand.

And then I wasn't.

20:05.790 --> 20:06.820
- I'm sorry.

20:06.860 --> 20:08.920
- I'm not asking for sympathy.

Besides, I wouldn't
expect you to understand.

I could tell.

You're not a mother.

20:27.640 --> 20:29.380
- Fair enough.

20:29.410 --> 20:32.520
Probably couldn't even hold
my kid's hand right without...

20:35.080 --> 20:37.950

to let me talk in there.

20:41.860 --> 20:43.490
- This is gonna be fun.

20:44.730 --> 20:46.660

20:46.700 --> 20:47.860
That's why we were at the mall.

20:47.900 --> 20:49.400

weeds these days.

it's a new this or that--

she was gone?

20:53.970 --> 20:55.640

20:56.840 --> 20:58.410
- So big, you know?
- Yeah.

20:58.440 --> 21:00.540
- We only looked away
for a couple of seconds.

21:00.580 --> 21:02.040
- She went to the mirror.

21:02.080 --> 21:03.550

21:03.580 --> 21:05.050
- "How does it look on me?"

- I don't know why
I didn't go with her.

21:06.920 --> 21:08.820
Or why I didn't either.

You poor thing, all alone.

Where's your husband?

21:22.670 --> 21:24.770

21:28.000 --> 21:29.970
- He's not around.

21:30.010 --> 21:33.880
Never has been.

gonna come here and save you.

24:57.250 --> 24:58.650
Are you sure?

24:58.680 --> 25:01.780
- About seven weeks,
give or take.

25:04.750 --> 25:08.060
Looks like Santy Claus
brought you a little present.

25:14.960 --> 25:16.200
- Hey.

25:16.230 --> 25:18.870
- Hey, hey,
what are you doing here?

25:18.900 --> 25:20.900
- I, uh,

25:20.940 --> 25:25.110
I got you this.

25:25.140 --> 25:26.840
- You got me a book?

25:26.880 --> 25:28.210
- Cheever.

25:28.240 --> 25:31.810
I remembered how much
you said you loved it.

25:31.850 --> 25:34.080
- Ah, yeah.

25:34.120 --> 25:35.350
Or is that just one of the

25:35.380 --> 25:38.620
many things you said
to get me in bed?

25:38.650 --> 25:41.820
- Right, so, do me a favor--
take this home.

25:41.860 --> 25:43.030
If I leave it here,

25:43.060 --> 25:44.290
some scumbag's
gonna walk away with it.

25:44.330 --> 25:46.060
- Any chance I can
take you to lunch?

25:46.090 --> 25:48.100
We need to talk.

25:48.130 --> 25:50.200
- You know I can't.

25:50.230 --> 25:52.740
- You never can, Nick.
- I...

25:52.770 --> 25:55.370
- Never good time to talk,
never good time for us.

25:55.400 --> 25:58.010
- Yo, how screwed are we?

25:58.040 --> 25:59.880
- Hello, Merry.

25:59.910 --> 26:01.240
- Hey.

26:01.280 --> 26:04.250
- Anyway, I see you're busy.

26:04.280 --> 26:06.950
We do need to talk.
Tonight?

26:06.980 --> 26:09.150
- Yep. Yep. Yep.

26:09.180 --> 26:11.850
- It's important, Nick.

26:11.890 --> 26:15.260
- I know.

26:15.290 --> 26:17.860
Tonight. I promise.

26:24.330 --> 26:27.000
- They wanna talk to me.

26:27.040 --> 26:30.340
- Fuck 'em.

26:30.370 --> 26:32.110
- That guy
is radioactive, Nick.

26:34.180 --> 26:37.010
- Sax.

26:37.050 --> 26:38.350
Damn it.
- What was that?

26:38.380 --> 26:41.650
- That son of a bitch
is beating on her again.

28:26.860 --> 28:28.190
- Sax.

28:28.220 --> 28:29.830
Sax!

28:33.460 --> 28:35.360
- Freeze!

28:35.400 --> 28:37.330
Don't move.

28:41.370 --> 28:43.140
- Okay.

28:43.170 --> 28:44.840
I guess this is happening.

28:44.870 --> 28:46.980
- If he moves,
put a hole in him.

28:55.020 --> 28:56.990
Where's the baby?

28:57.020 --> 28:58.850
Where's the goddamn baby?

28:58.890 --> 29:00.360
- Sax.

29:00.390 --> 29:02.260
Sax!

29:56.910 --> 29:58.310
- I mean, obviously I get it.

29:58.350 --> 30:00.150
It's not like I'm a communist,
for Christ sake.

30:00.180 --> 30:02.950
I'm just saying,
at the end of the day, it's...

30:02.990 --> 30:05.620
A thing you poop through,
nothing more, nothing less.

30:05.650 --> 30:07.590
- Dude, do you mind?

30:07.620 --> 30:09.560
I'm trying to work here.

30:09.590 --> 30:11.560
- I'm not the one who
offered up a free lap dance.

30:11.590 --> 30:14.430
- No, but my boss told me to
take you out of the main room

30:14.460 --> 30:16.160
because you were
spooking the clientele

30:16.200 --> 30:18.030
and now I can see why.

30:18.070 --> 30:19.970
- Bad for business
is my kinda thing.

30:20.000 --> 30:21.470
- Oh-Kay.

30:21.500 --> 30:23.470
I don't know what's
bringing me down more--

30:23.510 --> 30:27.440
your limp dick,
or your blah, blah, blah.

30:27.480 --> 30:28.940
Anyway,

30:28.980 --> 30:30.380
you ain't even here
for a good time.

30:30.410 --> 30:32.610
I heard you asking
questions out there.

30:32.650 --> 30:35.620
What is this, some pathetic
excuse for an investigation?

30:35.650 --> 30:38.250
- I'm beginning to wonder
the same thing myself.

30:38.290 --> 30:40.320
- Well, you ought
to talk to Mrs. Claws,

30:40.360 --> 30:43.090
because that bitch has been
here since dirt was young.

30:43.130 --> 30:46.030
And if she doesn't got
any answers for you,

30:46.060 --> 30:47.560
you're in the wrong club.

30:47.600 --> 30:48.630
- Mmm.

30:48.660 --> 30:51.030
Ha-ha-ha!

30:51.070 --> 30:52.600
- Whee!

30:56.700 --> 30:59.410
- We'll never speak of it.

31:01.340 --> 31:05.010
- ♪ Bad bitch kissing me
under a mistletoe ♪

31:08.520 --> 31:10.450
- Mrs. Claws.

31:20.060 --> 31:23.500
What can I do you for,
big and tall?

31:23.530 --> 31:27.040
- I'm sure you've heard
why I'm here.

31:27.070 --> 31:29.070
Who we're looking for.

31:29.100 --> 31:31.240
Now, you can
give it to me hard,

31:31.270 --> 31:32.710
or you give it to me easy.

31:32.740 --> 31:37.580
- I'd like to give it to you
ten ways from Sunday.

31:37.610 --> 31:40.080
- I'm not so sure
I'd say no to that.

31:42.680 --> 31:44.520
- You wear a Santa suit,

31:44.550 --> 31:48.020
you got issues,
one way or another.

31:48.060 --> 31:49.320
Goes with the territory.

31:49.360 --> 31:51.530
But the guy
you're looking for

31:51.560 --> 31:53.660
is something else.

31:53.700 --> 31:57.170
Reminds me of a fella
we all knew back in the day,

31:57.200 --> 32:00.300
back when Christmas
was Christmas.

32:00.340 --> 32:03.040
Worked at Gimbels
before it closed down.

32:03.070 --> 32:08.110
This was like Madison
Square Garden for Santas.

32:08.140 --> 32:11.280
The big enchilada.

32:11.310 --> 32:13.720
He was good.

32:13.750 --> 32:15.580
Real good.

32:15.620 --> 32:18.150
No one suspected
what really went on

32:18.190 --> 32:20.660
behind all the tinsel
and cellophane.

32:20.690 --> 32:23.160
Turns out the guy
was a real sicko.

32:23.190 --> 32:24.530
A monster.

32:24.560 --> 32:26.160
- A monster?

32:26.190 --> 32:27.600
- The elves knew, though.

32:27.630 --> 32:31.100
You can't keep much from
those little sons of bitches.

32:31.130 --> 32:32.500
They knew what
he did to the kids

32:32.530 --> 32:34.170
when mommy and daddy
weren't around,

32:34.200 --> 32:36.140
and they hated him for it.

32:36.170 --> 32:37.510
He was giving all of us in the

32:37.540 --> 32:41.380
yuletide economic niche
a bad name.

32:41.410 --> 32:43.380
Ended up hanging himself

32:43.410 --> 32:47.150
in Ladies' Intimates.

32:47.180 --> 32:49.620
The elves made sure of it.

32:49.650 --> 32:51.350
- You tell the story
like you was there.

32:51.390 --> 32:53.220
- If I was,
I'd never cop to it--

32:53.260 --> 32:55.490
not to you or anyone.

32:55.520 --> 32:57.360
Anyway...

32:57.390 --> 32:59.090
those were different times.

32:59.130 --> 33:01.360
Better times.

33:01.400 --> 33:03.700
Nowadays, they put freaks
like that on TV

33:03.730 --> 33:05.770
and make 'em millionaires.

33:05.800 --> 33:08.740
I used to ride that pole.

33:08.770 --> 33:10.770
Rode it good, too.

33:10.810 --> 33:12.370
- Yeah, it's a swell story,

33:12.410 --> 33:14.210
but need I remind you
that my monster

33:14.240 --> 33:16.510
is very much alive and kicking.

33:16.540 --> 33:18.580
Now, this
Gimbels piñata Santa--

33:18.610 --> 33:21.120
what the hell's he have to do
with the price of ass in China?

33:21.150 --> 33:23.650
- Not him.

33:23.690 --> 33:25.820
The son.

33:25.850 --> 33:27.520
He had a kid, that one.

33:27.560 --> 33:29.760
Can you imagine?

33:29.790 --> 33:31.530
Wound up institutionalized.

33:31.560 --> 33:34.360
No one heard anything
about him after that.

33:34.400 --> 33:36.230
- It's the kid, Nick.

33:36.260 --> 33:37.670
- Bit of a leap, ain't it?

33:37.700 --> 33:40.140
- I ain't saying he's
the one you're looking for.

33:40.170 --> 33:42.770
I ain't saying he ain't.

33:42.800 --> 33:45.740
Still...

33:45.770 --> 33:49.310
I wonder some nights.

33:49.340 --> 33:53.080
Where's that little boy now?

34:06.190 --> 34:08.860
- It's the fruitcake.

34:08.900 --> 34:11.429
It's magic.

34:11.469 --> 34:14.639
It makes you see things.

34:14.670 --> 34:18.239
Look.

34:23.710 --> 34:25.380
Do you see?

34:27.880 --> 34:29.880
Do you see?

34:39.630 --> 34:40.830
Just...

34:40.860 --> 34:44.770
just come with me.

34:44.800 --> 34:47.340
Come with me.

35:05.790 --> 35:10.260
We're going on a little trip.

35:10.290 --> 35:13.930
You're gonna take me
to see your daddy.

35:41.490 --> 35:42.120
- Tell me
she's gonna be okay.

35:42.960 --> 35:44.390
- I wish I could.

35:44.430 --> 35:47.330
- They cried to me
and I believed them.

35:47.360 --> 35:50.230
Why would anyone do that
to their own child?

35:50.270 --> 35:52.730
- Who knows?
15 minutes of fame?

35:52.770 --> 35:56.740
I stopped figuring out
the why a long time ago.

35:56.770 --> 35:59.370
- He never talked
to me about it.

35:59.410 --> 36:00.940
What he saw.

36:00.980 --> 36:02.610
Days like this.

36:02.640 --> 36:04.950
How he felt.

36:04.980 --> 36:06.310
Guess he had you for that.

36:09.650 --> 36:12.790
Yeah, some talker
that guy was.

36:12.820 --> 36:14.890
Couldn't shut him up.

36:17.760 --> 36:19.960
Sax didn't need
a shoulder to cry on.

36:19.990 --> 36:21.930
He was too strong for that.

36:21.960 --> 36:24.430
- That's what you call strong?

36:24.470 --> 36:28.800
And all this time I thought
you knew him better than I did.

36:28.840 --> 36:29.970
- Take you home.

36:30.000 --> 36:31.510
- We're not done.

36:31.540 --> 36:33.780
We still have other
parents to talk to.

36:35.580 --> 36:37.010
- Haven't you seen enough?

36:38.450 --> 36:40.380
- You're kidding, right?

36:43.020 --> 36:43.990
- Yeah?

36:44.020 --> 36:45.720
- "Yeah. Yeah."

36:45.750 --> 36:48.520
Such a vulgar way
to answer the telephone.

36:48.560 --> 36:49.820
- What do you want, Blue?

36:49.860 --> 36:51.630
- You know what I want,
Meredith.

36:51.660 --> 36:52.930
The question that should be

36:52.960 --> 36:54.600
keeping you awake
at night is,

36:54.630 --> 36:57.330
what am I prepared to do
to get it?

36:57.370 --> 36:59.600
- Don't worry.

36:59.630 --> 37:02.540
I've got a whole new way
into Nick Sax.

37:36.440 --> 37:38.340
- Mary!
Where's Mary?

37:38.370 --> 37:41.040
Mary, oh, look at this
wonderful, old, drafty house.

37:41.080 --> 37:42.440
Mary!

37:42.480 --> 37:45.050
Oh, George.

37:45.080 --> 37:46.650
- Are you real?

37:46.680 --> 37:48.520
You have no idea
what's happened to me.

37:48.550 --> 37:50.890
- You have no idea
what happened.

37:52.590 --> 37:54.760
- Thanks, hon.

37:57.790 --> 37:59.830
So...

37:59.860 --> 38:01.830
ready for that talk?

38:03.530 --> 38:05.430
- I don't wanna talk.

38:06.730 --> 38:10.340
- You don't wanna talk?

38:10.370 --> 38:12.510
You promised.

38:12.540 --> 38:16.440
I asked you, and you promised.

38:16.480 --> 38:17.950
How about this?

38:17.980 --> 38:20.680
You don't have to say
anything at all.

38:20.720 --> 38:24.550
I just need to
ask you a question.

38:24.590 --> 38:26.750
What if we were to...

38:26.790 --> 38:29.090
add another stocking
to the mantle?

38:32.460 --> 38:36.900
- Well, Amanda,
that is a wonderful idea.

38:36.930 --> 38:39.430
Let's bring an
innocent child into this

38:39.470 --> 38:41.440
wonderful, wonderful world.

38:44.140 --> 38:48.580
Filled with wonderful,
wonderful people--

38:48.610 --> 38:51.010
wonderful sights,

38:51.050 --> 38:52.480
wonderful sounds.

38:54.150 --> 38:55.680
Our little, perfect family--

38:55.720 --> 38:58.150
you, me,
and our bundle of bones

38:58.190 --> 39:02.790
and flesh...

39:02.820 --> 39:04.960
and blood.

39:06.690 --> 39:09.730
I mean, why not have a child?

39:09.760 --> 39:13.070
What's the worst thing
that can happen?

39:13.100 --> 39:15.140
Winds up like me?

39:15.170 --> 39:16.740
- To my big brother, George.

39:17.770 --> 39:19.940
The richest man in town.

39:24.750 --> 39:26.980
Ugh.

39:53.170 --> 39:54.510
- Ah?

40:10.220 --> 40:11.960
That's funny.

40:11.990 --> 40:14.200
You look just
like your picture.

40:46.790 --> 40:48.600
- Nick, Nick,
are you all right?

40:48.630 --> 40:50.970
What happened?
Oh, no. No. Oh, no.

40:51.000 --> 40:52.770
Oh, no.

41:00.210 --> 41:02.610
Huh?

41:10.220 --> 41:11.890
- I can see you.

41:16.260 --> 41:19.260
- ♪ I saw Mommy

41:19.290 --> 41:24.130
