00:23.924 --> 00:25.393
That is a mistake.
I disagree.

00:25.393 --> 00:27.261
I'm sure you do. Camilla.

00:27.261 --> 00:29.330
What do you want me to do?
The horse is out of the barn.

00:29.330 --> 00:31.499
We all think this guy's
leaking secrets to the Russians.

00:31.499 --> 00:33.101
Yeah, but we haven't
proven that yet.

00:33.101 --> 00:34.702
And Captain Macho here
just jumped the gun

00:34.702 --> 00:36.504
and put my counterintelligence
case in jeopardy.

00:36.504 --> 00:38.339
Captain Macho says
screw your case.

00:38.339 --> 00:40.174
National security
trumps domestic law

00:40.174 --> 00:41.275
every day of the week.

00:41.275 --> 00:42.776
It's nice to see
the Agency learned nothing

00:42.776 --> 00:43.877
from the War on Terror.

00:43.877 --> 00:45.613
We--
Enough.

00:45.613 --> 00:47.014
Go break the guy.

00:50.684 --> 00:52.386
You know I'm right.

00:52.386 --> 00:54.522
Right doesn't matter.

00:54.522 --> 00:56.790
It never has.

01:11.305 --> 01:13.641
Mr. Rice, I'm Matt Garza,
FBI Counterintelligence.

01:13.641 --> 01:15.276
You've already met
my colleague, yes?

01:15.276 --> 01:16.944
Yeah, but I
didn't get his name.

01:16.944 --> 01:18.946
You work as a code clerk
at the Embassy-- is that right?

01:18.946 --> 01:20.748
You know it is.

01:20.748 --> 01:23.083
Never been in a CIA
safe house before.

01:23.083 --> 01:24.618
Thought
it would be nicer.

01:24.618 --> 01:26.287
A little cavalier for
a guy accused of treason.

01:26.287 --> 01:27.588
Well,
what's the expression?

01:27.588 --> 01:28.789
Laugh to keep from crying?
Okay.

01:28.789 --> 01:30.291
We have evidence
that you've been

01:30.291 --> 01:31.725
selling secrets
to the Russians.

01:31.725 --> 01:33.127
No, you don't.

01:33.127 --> 01:34.628
'Cause I haven't.

01:34.628 --> 01:36.297
Mr. Rice, I appreciate
the fact that you think

01:36.297 --> 01:37.765
that you can
outsmart us right now,

01:37.765 --> 01:40.134
that you are <i>up</i>
for this moment,

01:40.134 --> 01:41.802
but you are an amateur.

01:41.802 --> 01:44.104
We're professionals who break
guys like you for a living.

01:44.104 --> 01:46.474
And if you think
the Russians have your back,

01:46.474 --> 01:48.075
you are hopelessly naive,

01:48.075 --> 01:50.611
because <i>you</i> are
a liability to them now.

01:50.611 --> 01:52.613
But if you tell us
everything you know

01:52.613 --> 01:54.448
about their intelligence network
here in Panama,

01:54.448 --> 01:56.284
you might be able to breathe
a little free air again

01:56.284 --> 01:57.651
before you die.

02:15.836 --> 02:17.004
What's happening?

02:17.004 --> 02:18.672
Aah!

02:25.979 --> 02:26.980
Get him out of here. Yep.

02:29.617 --> 02:31.452
Is this an act?
To get me to confess?

02:31.452 --> 02:32.820
No.
This is very real.

02:36.023 --> 02:37.991
Your comrades are here
to shut you up.

02:37.991 --> 02:39.327
Now you stay
along that wall.

02:39.327 --> 02:40.661
Do you understand me?

02:41.962 --> 02:43.997
Go, go, go. Stay on the wall.
Stay on the wall.

02:46.066 --> 02:47.668
Don't move!

02:47.668 --> 02:49.970
You okay?
How the hell did they
find this place?

03:05.886 --> 03:07.421
Grenade!

03:28.676 --> 03:31.479
We gotta go.
Let's go.

03:32.813 --> 03:34.014
Camilla.

03:34.014 --> 03:36.484
Camilla, we gotta go.

03:37.951 --> 03:39.119
Camilla?

03:39.119 --> 03:40.288
Matt!

03:40.288 --> 03:41.389
No. No, no.

03:41.389 --> 03:42.490
No!
Matt!

03:46.660 --> 03:48.796
Time to call it a night, Tío. Yep.

03:48.796 --> 03:50.398
I'm right behind you.

03:51.965 --> 03:54.001
I am, I promise.

04:24.632 --> 04:26.500
This is Garza.

04:30.638 --> 04:32.506
Who is this?

04:32.506 --> 04:34.174
No, yo--

04:38.078 --> 04:40.781
I need the jet on the tarmac
in 20.

04:40.781 --> 04:43.451
Fuel it for Washington, D.C.

05:19.453 --> 05:20.721
Hey, boss.

05:20.721 --> 05:23.223
Simone, listen, there's no time.
I'm in Washington, D.C.

05:23.223 --> 05:25.526
<i>I'm about to get arrested, and
I need to tell you two things.</i>

05:25.526 --> 05:27.461
Pomona Eddie
and A Fish Called Raven.

05:27.461 --> 05:29.363
You got it? You trust
no one but the team, okay?

05:30.364 --> 05:31.965
Let me see your hands, Matt.

05:31.965 --> 05:34.234
Miranda,
you got this all wrong.

05:34.234 --> 05:36.970
How many times have you
heard a suspect say that?

05:36.970 --> 05:39.707
Okay, it sounded weird
coming out of my mouth,

05:39.707 --> 05:41.409
but it is the truth.

05:41.409 --> 05:45.713
I hope so. Because you're
under arrest for espionage.

05:45.713 --> 05:50.718
♪ Ah ah, ah ah, ah-ah-ah-ah

05:50.718 --> 05:53.053
I don't understand.
I don't either.

05:53.053 --> 05:55.889
All I know is that Garza
called me at the crack of black

05:55.889 --> 05:58.926
and said, "Pomona Eddie
and A Fish Called Raven."

05:58.926 --> 06:00.260
What does that even mean?

06:00.260 --> 06:01.929
And why did he call you?
Seriously.

06:01.929 --> 06:03.263
Uh,
because I'm his favorite?

06:03.263 --> 06:04.498
Ah, that is not true.

06:04.498 --> 06:06.099
Can we focus
on the mystery at hand?

06:06.099 --> 06:08.268
I mean, does anyone have
any idea what this is about?

06:08.268 --> 06:10.337
Okay, Matt said
Pomona Eddie,

06:10.337 --> 06:12.039
which is a nickname
for Edwin Gomez.

06:12.039 --> 06:14.107
He was the subject
of a fraud investigation

06:14.107 --> 06:15.943
and insisted
that he was being framed.

06:15.943 --> 06:17.611
And it turned out
he was.

06:17.611 --> 06:20.948
Okay, so Garza's telling us
he's being framed, too.

06:20.948 --> 06:22.349
But what about
the second part?

06:22.349 --> 06:23.684
A Fish Called Raven?

06:23.684 --> 06:25.453
It's an episode of
"That's So Raven."

06:25.453 --> 06:27.020
I-I auditioned
for that show a few times.

06:27.020 --> 06:28.956
But why would he be talking
about a Disney show?

06:28.956 --> 06:32.526
And what crime could Matt
possibly be framed for?

06:32.526 --> 06:34.462
You know, he did work counterintelligence

06:34.462 --> 06:36.363
for a decade before he
came out to Los Angeles.

06:36.363 --> 06:38.899
And there was always rumors that
he was connected to some op

06:38.899 --> 06:40.568
that went epically wrong.

06:40.568 --> 06:41.635
Yeah, but if they were
only rumors,

06:41.635 --> 06:43.270
then the Bureau
buried it deep.

06:43.270 --> 06:46.607
So are we thinking that case
has come back around?

06:49.109 --> 06:50.277
Elena.

06:50.277 --> 06:51.278
What did you find?

06:51.278 --> 06:52.880
It's DEFCON 1 here.

06:52.880 --> 06:55.783
Some kind of counterintelligence emergency,

06:55.783 --> 06:57.284
but everyone's too scared
to talk to me.

06:57.284 --> 06:58.719
What was Matt doing
in D.C.?

06:58.719 --> 06:59.720
<i>I don't know.</i>

06:59.720 --> 07:01.555
I had no idea he was going.

07:01.555 --> 07:03.557
Air support said he called them
out of the blue last night.

07:03.557 --> 07:06.159
Touched down at five
in the morning.

07:06.159 --> 07:08.228
Chiles has an office
full of VIPs.

07:08.228 --> 07:10.731
And I heard a whisper that
there's a high-value individual

07:10.731 --> 07:12.299
squirreled away
up on the sixth floor.

07:12.299 --> 07:14.267
Okay, Elena, we need you
to work your sources

07:14.267 --> 07:15.469
in the assistant network--

07:15.469 --> 07:17.137
promise them anything
and everything.

07:17.137 --> 07:19.339
<i>We have to know
what is going on.</i>

07:19.339 --> 07:21.642
I'm on it.

07:25.813 --> 07:27.147
Elena.

07:28.516 --> 07:30.283
Elena, I need to talk to you.

07:33.053 --> 07:34.988
Elena!

07:42.462 --> 07:44.665
So... what's our play?

07:44.665 --> 07:45.999
If Garza is
under investigation,

07:45.999 --> 07:47.701
then we have to assume
that we are, too.

07:47.701 --> 07:49.870
They'll want to
interview us at a minimum.

07:49.870 --> 07:51.805
And at a maximum?
Polygraphs?

07:51.805 --> 07:54.374
What?
Suspension until the
investigation is closed?

07:54.374 --> 07:56.844
We need to split up.
You want inside or out?
In.

07:56.844 --> 07:57.845
Simone and I will
head into the office,

07:57.845 --> 07:59.312
and work the case
from there.

07:59.312 --> 08:00.380
All right.
Drop us off.

08:00.380 --> 08:01.715
We'll set up somewhere
off the grid,

08:01.715 --> 08:03.817
and we won't tell you where,
so that you, you know,

08:03.817 --> 08:06.319
don't have to lie.
So how do we
communicate safely?

08:06.319 --> 08:08.656
You know they're gonna be
all up on our phones

08:08.656 --> 08:10.123
since they're
investigating Garza.

08:10.123 --> 08:11.792
Well, I have a private
ClipTalk account--

08:11.792 --> 08:14.628
VampireLover51--
I-I used to lurk online

08:14.628 --> 08:16.496
to see what people
were saying about the show.

08:17.497 --> 08:20.000
I could post
the contact info on there.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.201
Yeah.

08:21.201 --> 08:23.136
Guys.
Yeah.

08:23.136 --> 08:26.139
We cannot let the boss
down on this one.

08:26.139 --> 08:28.075
- We won't.
- We won't.

08:43.591 --> 08:46.259
The handcuffs
really necessary?

08:46.259 --> 08:47.895
Yep.

08:47.895 --> 08:50.130
Cuff him in the front
for the flight.

08:54.301 --> 08:55.335
We're good to go.

08:55.335 --> 08:56.904
Copy that.

08:56.904 --> 08:58.105
JENA 6
ready for takeoff.

08:58.105 --> 08:59.206
Priority status.

09:02.710 --> 09:05.012
Target is in pocket. <i>Understood.
E.T.A.?</i>

09:05.012 --> 09:06.413
<i>5 hours, 20 minutes.</i>

09:06.413 --> 09:07.848
Has he said anything?

09:07.848 --> 09:09.249
Not yet.

09:09.249 --> 09:10.350
What about
your special guest?

09:10.350 --> 09:11.952
I'm about to get into it.

09:11.952 --> 09:14.421
Let me know the moment
any of Garza's team surface.

09:22.062 --> 09:23.463
Good morning.

09:23.463 --> 09:26.033
I'm Special Agent in Charge
Tracy Chiles.

09:26.033 --> 09:28.368
Tell me about Panama.

09:28.368 --> 09:30.771
Really?
You don't want to talk about

09:30.771 --> 09:32.539
what we found
in the trunk of that car?

09:32.539 --> 09:33.741
Oh, we'll get to that.

09:33.741 --> 09:34.975
For now,
let's talk about Panama.

09:34.975 --> 09:37.778
No one wants to talk
about Panama,

09:37.778 --> 09:39.212
and you don't
have the clearance.

09:39.212 --> 09:41.481
Nice try, but you know
that I'm fully read in.

09:41.481 --> 09:44.584
Otherwise, they wouldn't have
assigned me to investigate you.

09:44.584 --> 09:46.954
Tell me about Panama.
It's all in the file.

09:46.954 --> 09:49.256
No, it's not.
The file's incomplete--

09:49.256 --> 09:50.891
almost as if someone
scrubbed it.

09:50.891 --> 09:52.459
Yeah, well, I don't know
anything about that.

09:52.459 --> 09:54.795
Clearly, someone is trying
to set me up.

09:54.795 --> 09:58.799
So if you can just loop me in,
I can figure out who it is.

09:59.633 --> 10:02.069
Ah.

10:02.069 --> 10:04.604
It was worth a shot.

10:04.604 --> 10:06.740
What do you want to know?

10:06.740 --> 10:09.309
Start at the beginning.
Tell me about George Rice.

10:09.309 --> 10:10.678
George Rice.

10:10.678 --> 10:12.646
Rice was the Embassy
code clerk in Panama.

10:12.646 --> 10:14.481
He had been in country
for a year before we even

10:14.481 --> 10:17.985
started suspecting
that he was up to no good.

10:17.985 --> 10:20.688
Who's we?
The FBI, the DIA, the CIA.

10:20.688 --> 10:22.155
They were the ones
who had HUMINT

10:22.155 --> 10:24.157
that someone on our side
had been compromised.

10:24.157 --> 10:27.560
So... I flew down to Panama.

10:28.696 --> 10:30.831
Hey, I'm Matt Garza.

10:30.831 --> 10:34.334
And it's nice to meet you, too.

10:34.334 --> 10:36.103
Don't take it personally.

10:36.103 --> 10:38.338
Link's annoyed we have
to go through this whole
due process thing.

10:38.338 --> 10:39.773
If Link had his way,

10:39.773 --> 10:42.475
he'd just snatch
our targets off the street.

10:42.475 --> 10:44.044
Alan Brady. Oh.

10:44.044 --> 10:45.779
Defense Intelligence Agency.

10:45.779 --> 10:47.948
It's nice digs
we got here, huh?

10:47.948 --> 10:49.516
As top-secret illegal
safe houses

10:49.516 --> 10:51.819
in supposedly
allied countries go,

10:51.819 --> 10:53.553
it could be worse.

10:53.553 --> 10:54.888
Come meet the boss. Right.

10:54.888 --> 10:57.825
<i>♪ Parate, parate, parate,
parate ♪</i>

10:57.825 --> 10:58.859
Excuse me.

10:58.859 --> 11:00.160
Are you the LEGAT?

11:00.160 --> 11:02.529
Camilla Nava.
Have you been fully briefed?

11:02.529 --> 11:05.699
I was handed a plane ticket
and this address, so, no.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.468
George Rice.

11:08.468 --> 11:10.037
Code clerk at
the Embassy with access

11:10.037 --> 11:12.139
to code-name level
military secrets.

11:12.139 --> 11:13.807
The CIA has
circumstantial intel

11:13.807 --> 11:16.143
he's been selling those secrets
to the Russians. Oh.

11:16.143 --> 11:19.046
And we need proof
before we can act.

11:19.046 --> 11:21.148
Which is why
you called for me, huh?

11:21.148 --> 11:22.649
Not you specifically.

11:22.649 --> 11:25.753
I just asked for the best
investigator they had.

11:25.753 --> 11:26.854
Well, you got him.

11:26.854 --> 11:28.155
<i>Se que me puedes escuchar ♪</i>

11:28.155 --> 11:30.223
<i>Tanto que viviré ♪</i>

11:30.223 --> 11:31.258
We'll see.

11:31.258 --> 11:33.326
<i>Y lo que falta por sufrir ♪</i>

11:33.326 --> 11:35.095
Okay.

11:35.095 --> 11:37.397
And you pretty much know
what happened after that.

11:37.397 --> 11:41.201
Six months of an investigation
that broke so bad,

11:41.201 --> 11:43.103
every single agency
disavowed it.

11:43.103 --> 11:46.373
Everyone disavowed it because
there was talk of a mole.

11:46.373 --> 11:48.408
People think that someone
tipped off the Russians

11:48.408 --> 11:51.111
to the location
of the safe house.

11:51.111 --> 11:52.846
You think
that someone is me?

11:52.846 --> 11:55.115
Miranda, please.

11:55.115 --> 11:56.784
Don't you see
what's going on here?

11:56.784 --> 11:59.252
Think. Hm?

11:59.252 --> 12:01.121
It's been five years.

12:01.121 --> 12:02.622
Why is this coming up
now?

12:03.824 --> 12:05.625
You tell me, Matt.

12:05.625 --> 12:07.394
Some ghosts
never stop haunting you.

12:10.230 --> 12:11.231
You need to listen to me, Simone.

12:11.231 --> 12:12.800
We both want to help Garza,

12:12.800 --> 12:14.301
but we've gotta be
smart about it.

12:14.301 --> 12:15.803
We can bend the rules,
but we can't break them.

12:15.803 --> 12:17.137
And we cannot lie.

12:17.137 --> 12:18.872
That is the biggest sin
in the Bureau

12:18.872 --> 12:21.474
and the quickest path
to getting fired-- or worse.

12:21.474 --> 12:24.111
Do you understand?
Bend, don't break.
Got it.

12:26.346 --> 12:27.948
I need to be fast.

12:27.948 --> 12:29.883
There are two PSS goons
upstairs waiting for you

12:29.883 --> 12:31.952
while their friends take apart
my Tío's office.

12:31.952 --> 12:33.821
Is there anything
for them to find?

12:33.821 --> 12:35.956
Not unless they uncover the
secret compartment in his desk.

12:35.956 --> 12:37.290
He thinks I don't
know about it.

12:37.290 --> 12:38.658
The PSS crew
is pretty thorough.

12:38.658 --> 12:39.960
They'll find it
if they know to look.

12:39.960 --> 12:42.129
Then we never had
this conversation.

12:42.129 --> 12:43.964
Is there an update on
our mystery guest?

12:43.964 --> 12:46.466
No. Still digging.

12:46.466 --> 12:48.135
Do you think my Tío's
gonna be okay?

12:48.135 --> 12:49.636
It's too soon to tell.

12:50.703 --> 12:52.940
She deserves honesty,
not platitudes.

12:53.874 --> 12:56.810
Brendon is gonna post
a contact number

12:56.810 --> 12:58.311
on his lurker ClipTalk account.

12:58.311 --> 13:00.347
VampireLover51.
How do you--

13:00.347 --> 13:02.282
The posts were always
a little too needy,

13:02.282 --> 13:03.683
but no one else
would've figured it out.

13:03.683 --> 13:05.485
Okay, well, if you come up
with anything,

13:05.485 --> 13:09.289
hit them there in case...
we're unavailable.

13:14.862 --> 13:17.130
Special Agent Hope.
Special Agent Clark.

13:17.130 --> 13:19.499
You need to come with us.
Sure thing.

13:23.636 --> 13:26.339
Do we have time
to stop in the break room--

13:26.339 --> 13:27.674
get a cup of coffee?

13:27.674 --> 13:29.009
No.

13:29.009 --> 13:32.345
I would be a lot more pleasant
with a little kick in me.

13:32.345 --> 13:35.148
Move.

13:35.148 --> 13:36.283
Have a seat in there.

13:36.283 --> 13:38.185
Wh--
What about Carter?

13:38.185 --> 13:41.254
He'll be questioned
somewhere else.

13:43.490 --> 13:45.825
Hey, girl, hey.
You know what?

13:45.825 --> 13:49.362
I was thinking, your shoe game
does not get enough respect.

13:49.362 --> 13:50.530
Stop.

13:50.530 --> 13:51.999
Simone, what Garza
is accused of

13:51.999 --> 13:53.533
carries
a death sentence.

13:53.533 --> 13:55.502
We know he called you
from D.C. this morning,

13:55.502 --> 13:58.538
which makes you
a potential conspirator.

14:07.114 --> 14:07.614
Hey, no need for threats.

14:08.748 --> 14:10.683
We are
on the same team here.

14:10.683 --> 14:13.786
Go Feds! I mean--
Ask me anything.

14:15.722 --> 14:17.824
Did Garza give you an order
when he called you?

14:17.824 --> 14:21.494
I need exact details.

14:21.494 --> 14:24.932
No, not an order,
but definitely clues.

14:24.932 --> 14:27.000
The first one was
"Pomona Eddie."

14:27.000 --> 14:29.102
Safe words?
Code words.

14:29.102 --> 14:31.939
Go look up his fraud case
with Edwin Gomez.

14:31.939 --> 14:35.275
There's gonna be a clue there
that Garza's being framed.

14:35.275 --> 14:38.545
And second, he said
"A Fish Called Raven."

14:38.545 --> 14:40.047
What does that mean?
I'm not sure,

14:40.047 --> 14:42.515
but I'm guessing it
has something to do

14:42.515 --> 14:45.118
with Garza working
counterintelligence in Atlanta.

14:45.118 --> 14:46.786
That's like
espionage central.

14:46.786 --> 14:51.391
So there's probably some tie in
to the whole Raven thing.

14:51.391 --> 14:53.460
But y-you got his file
right there.

14:53.460 --> 14:55.095
Check it out.

15:02.469 --> 15:05.138
Maybe it has something
to do with Camilla Nava?

15:09.509 --> 15:11.644
Clever.
I learned that one
from Garza.

15:11.644 --> 15:13.046
All right, who is she?
No.

15:13.046 --> 15:15.148
I'm the one
asking the questions.

15:15.148 --> 15:17.050
What was Garza doing
in D.C.?

15:17.050 --> 15:18.986
I
honestly don't know.

15:18.986 --> 15:21.221
M-My part
in Garza's story

15:21.221 --> 15:23.090
started when he called me
this morning.

15:23.090 --> 15:24.724
And why did he call you?
You're just a trainee.

15:24.724 --> 15:26.994
I could clown and say
it's 'cause I'm cute,

15:26.994 --> 15:29.396
but I honestly
don't know.

15:29.396 --> 15:30.730
What aren't you
telling me?

15:30.730 --> 15:32.499
Ma'am, I'm telling you everything.

15:32.499 --> 15:35.969
If Garza says he was framed,
he was framed.

15:35.969 --> 15:38.171
And you should do everything
you can to try to help him out.

15:38.171 --> 15:40.107
The only thing
I <i>should</i> do

15:40.107 --> 15:42.442
is investigate this case
with impartiality.

15:42.442 --> 15:44.277
And how are you
gonna do that

15:44.277 --> 15:46.246
when you got
a hate-on for the man?

15:46.246 --> 15:47.314
Yeah.

15:47.314 --> 15:48.681
The next time we speak,

15:48.681 --> 15:50.517
you're gonna be hooked up
to a polygraph.

15:50.517 --> 15:52.185
In the meantime,
go back to your desk

15:52.185 --> 15:53.353
and don't try to
leave the building

15:53.353 --> 15:54.821
without
my express permission.

15:56.156 --> 15:57.424
And where are
Laura and Brendon?

15:57.424 --> 15:58.825
They're not answering
the phones.

15:58.825 --> 16:02.362
I don't know.
And that's the real.

16:02.362 --> 16:04.264
Hey, Smitty.

16:04.264 --> 16:06.433
Sergeant Grey says you guys
can set up shop

16:06.433 --> 16:08.168
in Interrogation Room A.

16:08.168 --> 16:10.470
Oh, great.
Tell him thanks.

16:10.470 --> 16:12.305
It's got a bit
of a rat problem.

16:12.305 --> 16:13.806
Or maybe don't.

16:13.806 --> 16:16.076
The phone line you asked for
is on the desk.

16:18.345 --> 16:20.180
What kind of case
you working, anyway?

16:20.180 --> 16:21.681
Thanks for your help.

16:22.915 --> 16:24.451
Okay.

16:24.451 --> 16:25.818
The first thing
we need to figure out

16:25.818 --> 16:28.721
is what kind of trouble
Garza is actually in.

16:28.721 --> 16:30.057
How are we
gonna do that?

16:30.057 --> 16:32.292
The investigation's
based out of the D.C. office.

16:32.292 --> 16:33.626
What are you doing?

16:33.626 --> 16:35.028
Calling in a favor.

16:36.796 --> 16:38.898
Mark Atlas.
'Sup, scrub?

16:38.898 --> 16:42.302
Well, if it isn't the second
best profiler in the FBI.

16:42.302 --> 16:43.703
No matter how many times
you say that,

16:43.703 --> 16:45.738
it's never gonna
be true, Mark.
Is that Atlas?

16:45.738 --> 16:47.474
Oh, say hi for me.
Hey. Hey, buddy.

16:47.474 --> 16:48.975
<i>How you doing?</i>
Hey, is that
my boy Brendon?

16:48.975 --> 16:50.210
Brendon! Hey.

16:50.210 --> 16:51.644
Okay, can we just--
just-- just

16:51.644 --> 16:53.846
hit a pause on the,
uh, bromance?

16:53.846 --> 16:55.482
Because I need a favor.

16:55.482 --> 16:57.684
Favor as in...
you and me?

16:57.684 --> 17:01.020
Shut up. No, um,
Matt is in trouble.

17:01.020 --> 17:02.655
He was arrested
in your backyard

17:02.655 --> 17:04.824
by agents from
your field office.

17:04.824 --> 17:06.659
You want me to find out what
evidence they have against him.

17:06.659 --> 17:08.495
<i>Mm-hmm.
That's a pretty big ask.</i>

17:08.495 --> 17:09.496
Do you trust me?

17:09.496 --> 17:10.897
With my life.

17:10.897 --> 17:12.099
<i>Then do this.</i>

17:12.099 --> 17:14.434
<i>For you? Okay.</i>

17:14.434 --> 17:15.735
Thank you.

17:15.735 --> 17:17.470
Tell him his fantasy team's
garbage.

17:18.638 --> 17:21.074
Tell me about your relationship
with Camilla Nava.

17:21.074 --> 17:23.143
We worked together
in Panama.

17:25.612 --> 17:28.115
And we were sleeping together,
but you already knew that

17:28.115 --> 17:30.717
or else you wouldn't be
trying to catch me in a lie.

17:30.717 --> 17:33.320
Why didn't you disclose it?
No one ever asked.

17:36.456 --> 17:38.458
And it didn't matter.

17:38.458 --> 17:40.260
When did it start?

17:40.260 --> 17:41.594
Over the past
three months,

17:41.594 --> 17:43.463
I've been racking up
frequent flyer miles for nothing

17:43.463 --> 17:46.799
because the CIA won't
give me anything actionable.

17:46.799 --> 17:48.568
Rice is careful.

17:48.568 --> 17:51.238
Clearly, the Russians have
taught him some tradecraft.

17:51.238 --> 17:52.239
Yeah.

17:52.239 --> 17:53.940
<i>Y tambien senti mental ♪</i>

17:53.940 --> 17:56.209

17:58.811 --> 18:00.580

18:00.580 --> 18:03.983

18:07.320 --> 18:08.955
and stare at this table,
or what?

18:08.955 --> 18:10.957
Do you have something
better in mind?
I do.

18:10.957 --> 18:13.326
<i>...la cumbia ♪</i>

18:13.326 --> 18:15.528

18:18.498 --> 18:20.567

18:26.105 --> 18:29.509

18:38.017 --> 18:39.352
Was it serious?

18:40.820 --> 18:42.455
It was for me.

18:42.455 --> 18:45.292
Then you betrayed her...
and your country

18:45.292 --> 18:47.026
to the Russians
for what, money?

18:47.026 --> 18:49.296
Didn't happen, and you need
a refresher course

18:49.296 --> 18:50.630
on questioning
high-level suspects

18:50.630 --> 18:51.964
because
that was ham-handed.

18:51.964 --> 18:53.966
If you're so innocent,
then why fly to D.C.

18:53.966 --> 18:55.702
in the middle of the night
on a moment's notice?

18:55.702 --> 18:57.337
I received
an anonymous phone call

18:57.337 --> 18:59.472
from someone using
a voice modulator

18:59.472 --> 19:01.974
claiming to have new intel
on what went down in Panama.

19:01.974 --> 19:03.843
I was given the address
of a parking lot

19:03.843 --> 19:05.645
and the car's plate number.

19:05.645 --> 19:06.813
Or you were called
with a warning

19:06.813 --> 19:08.315
'cause someone was
gonna snitch on you

19:08.315 --> 19:10.149
and you were
just trying to run.
That's not what happened.

19:10.149 --> 19:12.319
Then how do you explain what we
found in the trunk of that car?

19:12.319 --> 19:14.221
It's really bad.

19:14.221 --> 19:17.290
Atlas found out that Garza
was busted in D.C.

19:17.290 --> 19:19.659
grabbing go-bags full of
$2 million in cash

19:19.659 --> 19:21.628
and several
forged passports.

19:21.628 --> 19:24.231
That's a lot of money to
sacrifice for a frame job.

19:24.231 --> 19:27.334
Right?
It's a steal when the
alternative is a firing squad.

19:27.334 --> 19:30.570
Well, whatever is going on
is connected to Camilla Nava.

19:30.570 --> 19:33.973
She was the LEGAT in Panama
when Garza worked down there.

19:33.973 --> 19:37.510
Her file says she died five
years ago in a car accident.

19:37.510 --> 19:39.178
That's clearly
a cover story.

19:39.178 --> 19:41.080
Cats got nothing on you.

19:41.080 --> 19:42.715
Gotta walk between
the raindrops.

19:42.715 --> 19:45.151
The SAC has the PSS goon squad
on the lookout for me.

19:45.151 --> 19:46.886
Did you find out
who's lying about Garza

19:46.886 --> 19:48.555
up on the sixth floor?
No.

19:48.555 --> 19:50.890
None of the assistants
are in the know.

19:50.890 --> 19:53.192
And that's,
like, a first. Damn.

19:53.192 --> 19:56.195
Garza's being framed
for a case five years ago

19:56.195 --> 19:58.064
that resulted
in this woman's death.

19:58.064 --> 19:59.932
We need to figure out
what happened on that op.

19:59.932 --> 20:02.935
And decipher what he meant by
the "That's So Raven" reference.

20:02.935 --> 20:04.737
Wait.
What did he say exactly?

20:04.737 --> 20:07.240
He said
"A Fish Called Raven."

20:07.240 --> 20:08.575
You know what it means?

20:08.575 --> 20:11.578
Well, in eighth grade,
I had a terrible flu,

20:11.578 --> 20:14.213
and Uncle Matt took the week off
to stay home with me.

20:14.213 --> 20:16.115
We binged every episode
of "That's So Raven."

20:16.115 --> 20:18.084
And in my favorite episode
of all time,

20:18.084 --> 20:19.619
Eddie heroically
gives up the ball to Gino

20:19.619 --> 20:21.254
to shoot
the winning basket.

20:21.254 --> 20:25.758
Tío used to always tell me
when 33 and 40 worked as a team,

20:25.758 --> 20:27.294
there's nothing
they couldn't do.

20:27.294 --> 20:29.529
Garza already told us not to
trust anyone outside the team.

20:29.529 --> 20:30.930
It's gotta mean
something else.

20:30.930 --> 20:33.766
3-3-4-0.

20:33.766 --> 20:36.569
That has to be the combo to the
hidden compartment in his desk.

20:36.569 --> 20:38.237
I bet Garza kept
his own records.

20:38.237 --> 20:39.906
All we need to do is
sneak into Garza's office,

20:39.906 --> 20:41.874
access his secret drawer
in his desk--

20:41.874 --> 20:44.711
all without being seen
by the security specialists

20:44.711 --> 20:46.078
who are guarding it.

20:46.078 --> 20:47.547
Is that all?

20:52.952 --> 20:53.986
You need to distract them
long enough for me to sneak in

20:55.021 --> 20:56.255
and find Garza's
secret compartment.

20:56.255 --> 20:57.657
I thought I was gonna
be the one sneaking in.

20:57.657 --> 20:58.791
You're still
a probationary agent.

20:58.791 --> 20:59.792
You get caught,
you're fired.

20:59.792 --> 21:01.060
But me?

21:01.060 --> 21:02.629
Well, I'll actually
be fired, too.

21:02.629 --> 21:05.932
Point is, we both know you
make a much better distraction.

21:05.932 --> 21:08.935
Point well made.
I do look extra cute today.

21:08.935 --> 21:10.837
Watch me do my thang.

21:20.146 --> 21:22.682
Oh, man, it's jammed.

21:22.682 --> 21:24.451
Excuse me, sweet thing.

21:24.451 --> 21:28.421
You think you could come
and help me out with this?

21:28.421 --> 21:30.423
I mean, you do have
the muscles for it.

21:30.423 --> 21:32.258
Pretty please?

21:32.258 --> 21:34.293
Sure thing.
What's your name?

21:34.293 --> 21:37.029
Anthony, but my friends
call me Tony. Okay.

21:37.029 --> 21:39.198
I want to be
your friend, Tony.

21:39.198 --> 21:41.200
You think you can use these
muscles you brought to work

21:41.200 --> 21:43.370
to help me
get behind there?

21:44.737 --> 21:47.374
Yeah, because I don't know
why it keeps jamming.

21:51.811 --> 21:53.346
Kahn!

21:54.180 --> 21:56.315
What the hell
are you doing?
Being a dear.

21:56.315 --> 21:59.352
Helping me because
the copier got jammed.

21:59.352 --> 22:01.153
And abandoning his post.

22:05.492 --> 22:07.460
Get back
up to the office.

22:07.460 --> 22:09.228
I'm taking over.

22:09.228 --> 22:10.730
Well,
what about you, sis?

22:10.730 --> 22:12.799
Do you think you could
help me out with this?

22:12.799 --> 22:15.334
'Cause technology
hates me.

22:16.335 --> 22:18.905
Apparently you do, too.

22:29.482 --> 22:31.651
<i>Hey, is this
the IT department?</i>

22:31.651 --> 22:33.319
<i>The copier is
jammed again.</i>

22:33.319 --> 22:35.187
My leg is cramping.
Get her out of here.

22:35.187 --> 22:37.490
Yeah, I tried that,
and it didn't work.

22:37.490 --> 22:39.692
Simone, you need to create
another distraction.

22:39.692 --> 22:45.231
I did work with some
juvenile delinquents in my day.

22:45.231 --> 22:46.899
They taught me
a few tricks.

22:46.899 --> 22:48.501
<i>Please don't burn
the building down.</i>

22:48.501 --> 22:51.638
<i>No promises.
But be ready to move.</i>

22:54.474 --> 22:56.443
Gotta figure this out.

22:56.443 --> 22:59.378
We gotta do
everything around here.

23:16.796 --> 23:18.297
Oh, shoot.

23:18.297 --> 23:19.599
Where's
the fire extinguisher?

23:19.599 --> 23:21.768
A-Around that corner!

23:30.543 --> 23:33.079
Oh. What the hell
is going on in here?

23:33.079 --> 23:36.483
I've been telling you that
the copier was broken forever.

23:36.483 --> 23:38.718
Men.
They don't listen.

23:38.718 --> 23:40.052
Well, she saved the day.

23:40.052 --> 23:42.088
Black girl magic.

23:44.957 --> 23:47.093
Carter and Simone
got Garza's Panama file.

23:47.093 --> 23:48.394
It's worse
than we thought.

23:48.394 --> 23:50.296
<i>Garza was
a part of a task force</i>

23:50.296 --> 23:52.398
investigating a mole
in the State Department--

23:52.398 --> 23:53.933
George Rice.

23:53.933 --> 23:55.968
They were questioning him
in a CIA safe house

23:55.968 --> 23:58.738
when Russian Special Ops
stormed in, captured Rice,

23:58.738 --> 24:00.573
and killed the LEGAT,
Camilla Nava.

24:00.573 --> 24:02.274
No wonder everyone
buried this so deep.

24:02.274 --> 24:04.110
Well, clearly, someone
on our side's working with Rice

24:04.110 --> 24:05.678
and leaked
the safe house location.

24:05.678 --> 24:07.580
Yeah, and the Bureau
thinks that someone was Garza.

24:07.580 --> 24:10.349
Which is all horrifying,
but we need actionable intel

24:10.349 --> 24:11.651
if you're gonna prove
Garza's innocence.

24:11.651 --> 24:12.952
<i>Well, how about this?</i>

24:12.952 --> 24:14.621
Garza's notes show that he spent
the last five years

24:14.621 --> 24:16.322
investigating Adam Link,

24:16.322 --> 24:18.991
the CIA Case Officer overseeing
the spy hunt in Panama.

24:18.991 --> 24:20.493
Yeah, that makes things
ten times worse.

24:20.493 --> 24:22.328
The Agency's impenetrable.

24:22.328 --> 24:24.597
Well, Link doesn't work
for the Agency anymore.

24:24.597 --> 24:26.633
Langley bounced him
shortly after the mission.

24:26.633 --> 24:28.467
He's since gone private,
and his client list

24:28.467 --> 24:30.837
is a who's who
of international scumbags.

24:30.837 --> 24:32.438
Any hard evidence?
<i>Circumstantial.</i>

24:32.438 --> 24:34.807
But Garza got a tip
a few weeks ago

24:34.807 --> 24:36.643
from a source
in the State Department

24:36.643 --> 24:38.010
that Link got his hands

24:38.010 --> 24:39.812
on some stolen
confidential documents.

24:39.812 --> 24:41.313
Why hasn't
he been arrested?

24:41.313 --> 24:43.850
I guess Garza felt
he needed an ironclad case.

24:43.850 --> 24:45.985
M-Maybe Link found out
he was closing in on them,

24:45.985 --> 24:47.687
<i>decided he would be
the fall guy?</i>

24:47.687 --> 24:48.988
Yeah, and Link would have
the resources

24:48.988 --> 24:50.222
and the tradecraft
to pull it off.

24:50.222 --> 24:51.624
So he's gotta be
the mystery man

24:51.624 --> 24:53.059
on the sixth floor then, right?

24:53.059 --> 24:54.794
Driving the final nail
into Garza's coffin?

24:54.794 --> 24:56.295
You know,
if Link's upstairs,

24:56.295 --> 24:57.530
now would be
a pretty good time

24:57.530 --> 24:59.498
to search his house,
prove he's the real traitor.

24:59.498 --> 25:01.333
I mean, with the intel
we got from Garza,

25:01.333 --> 25:02.869
we might have enough
to get a search warrant.

25:02.869 --> 25:04.303
Maybe, but you can't
call in a warrant

25:04.303 --> 25:05.872
without getting
the SAC's attention.

25:05.872 --> 25:08.340
You're right.
We can't.

25:10.076 --> 25:12.144
<i>But you can.</i>

25:14.647 --> 25:16.683
We have a sneak and peek
warrant--

25:16.683 --> 25:18.017
which means what?

25:18.017 --> 25:20.186
Really?
A pop quiz, now?

25:20.186 --> 25:22.054
Okay, look,
I am still your training agent,

25:22.054 --> 25:24.223
and it is my job
to evaluate your ability

25:24.223 --> 25:26.659
to keep thinking in
high-pressure situations, so...

25:26.659 --> 25:28.861
Fine. It's a search warrant
where the subject isn't aware

25:28.861 --> 25:30.697
that the premises
is being searched,

25:30.697 --> 25:32.064
and a Search Warrant Return
isn't provided

25:32.064 --> 25:34.533
until they're indicted
or arrested, right?

25:34.533 --> 25:36.202
Acceptable.
Can I break into
this house now?

25:36.202 --> 25:38.004
I don't know.
Can you?

25:39.706 --> 25:41.674
You okay?
I haven't
even started yet.

25:43.776 --> 25:46.112
You know, 'cause if you're
having a little bit of
performance anxiety,

25:46.112 --> 25:48.781
then I--
Oh. Wait a minute.

25:48.781 --> 25:49.849
I wasn't.

25:49.849 --> 25:50.950
Now I'm in your head?

25:50.950 --> 25:54.887
Or I'm just an actor
with a...

25:54.887 --> 25:57.890
flair for the dramatic.

25:57.890 --> 25:59.759
Okay.

26:00.927 --> 26:03.395
Link could have stashed
these files anywhere.

26:03.395 --> 26:06.465
So let's get to looking.

26:06.465 --> 26:08.801
I'll start here.

26:08.801 --> 26:10.036
Yeah, I'll start here.

26:13.472 --> 26:15.808
I just hate
being trapped here.

26:15.808 --> 26:17.309
We should be out
there helping them--

26:17.309 --> 26:18.645
There's something
you should see.

26:18.645 --> 26:20.112
Girl, I swear,

26:20.112 --> 26:21.914
if you sneak up on me
one more time.

26:21.914 --> 26:23.315
Front Desk Dave
hooked me up

26:23.315 --> 26:24.884
with security cam footage
of the sixth floor

26:24.884 --> 26:26.986
where our mystery witness
has been locked away.

26:26.986 --> 26:29.455
At 5:00 a.m., he walks through
the front doors,

26:29.455 --> 26:31.557
announces himself,
and all the alarms go off.

26:31.557 --> 26:34.326
Why would the alarms go off
for a retired CIA agent?

26:35.795 --> 26:38.330
Wait!
T-That's George Rice.

26:38.330 --> 26:40.132
He's supposed to be
in Russia.

26:40.132 --> 26:41.467
This is the framework
of an agreement

26:41.467 --> 26:42.802
with
the Justice Department

26:42.802 --> 26:44.336
granting you immunity
and WITSEC

26:44.336 --> 26:46.138
in exchange
for your testimony

26:46.138 --> 26:48.641
against Supervisory
Special Agent Garza.

26:48.641 --> 26:50.810
Sweet.

26:51.811 --> 26:53.946
You seem unhappy.
Well, what can I say?

26:53.946 --> 26:56.615
I hate making
deals with traitors.

26:56.615 --> 26:59.151
Even if it is
for the greater good.

26:59.151 --> 27:00.319
Hold up.

27:00.319 --> 27:03.656
If Rice
is talking to Chiles,

27:03.656 --> 27:05.825
then where the hell
is Adam Link?

27:05.825 --> 27:07.660
Whoa!

27:13.933 --> 27:14.867
We're with the FBI.
We have a warrant.

27:15.868 --> 27:17.369
Put the gun down,
Mr. Link.

27:17.369 --> 27:19.806
Shooting us will only
make things worse for you.

27:19.806 --> 27:22.975
Did Garza send you to plant
evidence in my house?

27:22.975 --> 27:24.643
To frame me for his crime?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

27:24.643 --> 27:25.945
We're here because
you're framing Garza,

27:25.945 --> 27:26.979
not the other way around.

27:26.979 --> 27:29.148
Put your gun down.

27:29.148 --> 27:31.317
Gun. Down. Now!

27:38.490 --> 27:41.994
Why would I frame Garza
if I think he's guilty?

27:41.994 --> 27:43.462
We know that you recently
came into possession

27:43.462 --> 27:44.797
of top secret documents.

27:44.797 --> 27:46.532
I don't admit to that--
it would be a crime.

27:46.532 --> 27:48.868
Well, you're gonna have
to tell us something
to exonerate yourself.

27:48.868 --> 27:50.636
Otherwise you're leaving here
in handcuffs.

27:50.636 --> 27:53.906
Look, I know Garza's been trying
to pin Panama on me for years.

27:53.906 --> 27:56.375
But that op
wrecked my life.

27:56.375 --> 27:59.645
We lost Rice,
Camilla was killed--

27:59.645 --> 28:01.480
all on my watch.

28:01.480 --> 28:04.050
After that, I spiraled.

28:04.050 --> 28:06.485
Got drunk for a year
and was fired from the Agency.

28:06.485 --> 28:09.021
Okay, we're gonna need
more than a sob story

28:09.021 --> 28:11.257
to convince us that you
didn't set up our boss.

28:11.257 --> 28:14.226
How about hundreds of pages
of notes?

28:14.226 --> 28:16.729
Dozens of hours
of phone transcripts

28:16.729 --> 28:19.498
trying to get evidence
that would nail Garza.

28:19.498 --> 28:21.667
Why the hell would I go
to all that trouble

28:21.667 --> 28:23.069
if I was just
gonna frame him?

28:25.271 --> 28:26.572
What do you think?

28:26.572 --> 28:28.941
I think what he's telling us
doesn't fit the profile

28:28.941 --> 28:32.278
of someone trying
to cover their tracks.

28:32.278 --> 28:35.848
It fits someone trying
to uncover the truth.

28:35.848 --> 28:38.084
Laura says Link's
not the mole.

28:42.789 --> 28:44.957
This whole time he and Garza
have been convinced

28:44.957 --> 28:46.625
the other was the mole,
but they were both wrong.

28:46.625 --> 28:49.461
Then we gotta get the two of
them together to hash this out

28:49.461 --> 28:51.798
so they can ID
who the real mole is.

28:51.798 --> 28:54.901
How? Garza's in custody
30,000 feet in the air.

28:56.202 --> 28:57.770
Katherine.

29:06.712 --> 29:08.114
JENA 6, go ahead.

29:08.114 --> 29:09.782
Hey, girl, it's Simone.

29:09.782 --> 29:12.418
I need a favor--
on the DL.

29:12.418 --> 29:13.953
<i>Okay.</i>

29:13.953 --> 29:15.321
I need
to speak to Garza.

29:15.321 --> 29:17.589
That's a negative.

29:17.589 --> 29:18.925
Please?

29:18.925 --> 29:21.327
Garza has always
been there for you.

29:21.327 --> 29:22.795
He gave you
extra time off

29:22.795 --> 29:24.663
when your father
had emergency surgery.

29:24.663 --> 29:26.665
Remember that?
That's not fair.

29:26.665 --> 29:29.235
I don't have time
to play fair, Kate.

29:29.235 --> 29:31.137
This is a matter
of life or death.

29:31.137 --> 29:34.640
<i>Garza needs</i> you.

29:34.640 --> 29:36.075
Understood.

29:36.075 --> 29:37.676
Stand by.

29:38.710 --> 29:40.279
So, another security check. Mm.

29:40.279 --> 29:42.815
I'm gonna hit the head.

29:56.963 --> 29:58.965
I'm thirsty. You?
Scotch.

29:58.965 --> 30:00.967
Rear top left.
No label.

30:06.538 --> 30:08.340
For my cholesterol.

30:10.342 --> 30:12.011
Should you be mixing it
with alcohol?

30:12.011 --> 30:13.712
No, but the way
this day is going,

30:13.712 --> 30:17.249
this might be the last sip of
Scotch I have for a while, so...

30:20.019 --> 30:21.553
We're beginning our descent.

30:21.553 --> 30:23.923
Now would be the time to
use the bathroom, if needed.

30:26.225 --> 30:27.493
Is that all right?

30:27.493 --> 30:29.295
Yeah.

30:43.242 --> 30:45.677
<i>Hello?</i>
Hey, boss.

30:45.677 --> 30:47.013
<i>It's so good
to hear your voice.</i>

30:47.013 --> 30:48.680
Look,
the team is all here.

30:48.680 --> 30:49.916
Thank you all,
but I don't have much time.

30:49.916 --> 30:51.317
So what did you find?

30:51.317 --> 30:53.419
George Rice is alive
and in FBI custody

30:53.419 --> 30:55.654
and given a statement
that <i>you're</i> the Russian mole.

30:55.654 --> 30:57.389
Well, then he's working
with Link to frame me.

30:57.389 --> 30:59.525
No, he's not.

30:59.525 --> 31:02.328
My bad, sir. Mr. Link is here,
and he is <i>not</i> the mole.

31:02.328 --> 31:03.662
<i>Are you sure?</i>
Yes.

31:03.662 --> 31:04.931
He wants to get
to the bottom of this

31:04.931 --> 31:07.266
just as much as you do.

31:13.439 --> 31:14.106
Miranda, wait.
This is my team.

31:15.807 --> 31:17.509
You need
to listen to them.

31:17.509 --> 31:19.211
Oh, they'll have
plenty of time to talk

31:19.211 --> 31:21.780
in an interrogation room.
Just listen.

31:21.780 --> 31:23.849
<i>Ma'am,
this is Simone Clark.</i>

31:23.849 --> 31:25.952
If you're
investigating Garza,

31:25.952 --> 31:28.254
then you've taken a look
at all of us.

31:28.254 --> 31:31.457
<i>You know exactly who we are.</i>

31:31.457 --> 31:33.892
So ask yourself--
what's more believable?

31:33.892 --> 31:35.962
That Garza found four agents

31:35.962 --> 31:38.030
willing to throw away
their careers

31:38.030 --> 31:41.968
and betray everything they
believed in to go the dark side?

31:41.968 --> 31:45.137
<i>Or that Garza's innocent,</i>

31:45.137 --> 31:46.973
and we love this man so much

31:46.973 --> 31:52.111
we're willing to risk our jobs
and our freedom to prove it?

31:52.111 --> 31:53.980
<i>Come on, now.</i>

31:57.916 --> 32:00.786
This better be good.
It is.

32:00.786 --> 32:02.888
Five years ago,
someone tipped off the Russians

32:02.888 --> 32:05.457
about us interrogating
George Rice.

32:05.457 --> 32:07.893
And because of that,
Rice was taken

32:07.893 --> 32:09.595
<i>and Camilla Nava
was killed.</i>

32:09.595 --> 32:12.798
<i>Now, every agency connected
tried to bury that screw-up.</i>

32:12.798 --> 32:16.235
<i>But I never stopped trying to
find out who tipped them off.</i>

32:16.235 --> 32:18.904
<i>And I was convinced that
it was Adam Link from the CIA.</i>

32:18.904 --> 32:20.672
<i>But I was wrong.</i>

32:20.672 --> 32:23.976
Which only leaves
one viable suspect--

32:23.976 --> 32:25.744
Alan Brady.

32:25.744 --> 32:29.415
Brady's about to be nominated
for Deputy Secretary of Defense.

32:29.415 --> 32:31.984
And you're telling me you
think he's a Russian mole?

32:31.984 --> 32:35.021
Yes. We think he was
secretly working with Rice

32:35.021 --> 32:37.423
and directed the Russians
to the safe house.

32:37.423 --> 32:40.792
That's... crazy
and a political nightmare

32:40.792 --> 32:43.962
and still doesn't answer
the basic question. Why now?

32:43.962 --> 32:45.297
<i>Well, the answer to
that question, Tracy,</i>

32:45.297 --> 32:48.467
<i>is sitting in an interrogation
room on the sixth floor.</i>

32:55.007 --> 32:57.443
Is everything finalized?

32:57.443 --> 32:59.545
Long time no see, George.

32:59.545 --> 33:01.013
T-This man's
a dangerous criminal.

33:01.013 --> 33:03.649
See,
we went down that road...

33:03.649 --> 33:05.717
led us right back
to you.

33:05.717 --> 33:07.319
Our last interrogation
was interrupted

33:07.319 --> 33:08.854
by the arrival
of your comrades.

33:08.854 --> 33:12.624
But there is no one
who's here to save you now.

33:12.624 --> 33:14.360
Clemency deal is DOA.

33:14.360 --> 33:17.196
It only comes back to life
if you come clean.

33:17.196 --> 33:19.298
So...

33:19.298 --> 33:21.533
why did you really
show up today, George?

33:29.075 --> 33:31.343
Do you know how cold it is
in Arkhangelsk?

33:31.343 --> 33:33.145
Huh? How lonely?

33:33.145 --> 33:36.115
You don't speak the language.
You can't travel, socialize.

33:37.116 --> 33:38.917
The Russians
promised me heaven.

33:38.917 --> 33:40.719
Okay? And they gave me hell. Yeah.

33:40.719 --> 33:43.322
And then you see a guy who did
the exact same thing as you,

33:43.322 --> 33:45.257
except he's climbing the ranks
to become number two

33:45.257 --> 33:47.193
at the Defense Department, right?

33:47.193 --> 33:49.761
And you've got
leverage over him.
Damn straight.

33:49.761 --> 33:51.563
Look,
I-I-I leaked a few secrets,

33:51.563 --> 33:53.031
but Brady had been
feeding the Russians

33:53.031 --> 33:55.234
classified material
for a decade,

33:55.234 --> 33:57.436
ever since they honey-potted him
into becoming an asset.

33:57.436 --> 33:58.770
So I reached out, okay?

33:58.770 --> 34:01.407
I-I reminded him
of what I knew.

34:02.441 --> 34:03.942
He figured out a way

34:03.942 --> 34:07.513
to secretly bring me back
to the States with a plan--

34:07.513 --> 34:09.515
I offer the government
an active mole,

34:09.515 --> 34:12.284
I get to live
a new life in WITSEC.

34:12.284 --> 34:14.052
If you framed me.

34:14.052 --> 34:16.588
You were
the obvious choice.

34:18.090 --> 34:20.292
Brady knew about the affair
you were having,

34:20.292 --> 34:22.628
and that you hadn't
disclosed it.

34:22.628 --> 34:26.031
He came up with all that cash
to plant in the trunk,

34:26.031 --> 34:28.834
manufactured all the other
evidence against you.

34:33.572 --> 34:36.642
All right,
you've got a choice.

34:36.642 --> 34:39.811

37:17.068 --> 37:19.771
out of everyone you could have
called this morning,

37:19.771 --> 37:21.440
why Simone?
Really?

37:21.440 --> 37:23.208
After everything you learned
today, that-- that--

37:23.208 --> 37:24.443
that's what
you're dying to know?

37:24.443 --> 37:25.777
That's fascinating.

37:25.777 --> 37:27.145
I won't lie.
I'm curious, too.

37:27.145 --> 37:29.147
Matt, why her?
Oh, my gosh.

37:29.147 --> 37:30.582
You guys
sound like haters.

37:30.582 --> 37:33.251
It's obviously
because I'm his favorite.

37:33.251 --> 37:34.620
Right.
Speak your truth, boss.

37:34.620 --> 37:36.588
We all know <i>I'm</i>
his favorite.
It's very simple.

37:36.588 --> 37:38.657
Simone was at the very top
of my recent caller's list,

37:38.657 --> 37:40.258
and I was in a hurry.

37:40.258 --> 37:42.294
I knew it. Mm. Yeah.

37:42.294 --> 37:44.996
Now, everyone, let's just
get our asses home

37:44.996 --> 37:46.332

37:51.136 --> 37:53.639

37:53.639 --> 37:56.842
Okay, "A," that is
painfully corny.

37:56.842 --> 37:59.811
And, "B," is that what
I've been reduced to?

37:59.811 --> 38:01.780
Heat?
<i>I was thinking, um,</i>

38:01.780 --> 38:03.982
if you're coming back east
for the holidays,

38:03.982 --> 38:05.317
after you spend
some time with your family,

38:05.317 --> 38:08.854
maybe... we could spend
a little time together.

38:10.522 --> 38:13.792
Or we could skip the part
where I visit my family

38:13.792 --> 38:16.695

come straight to you?

38:16.695 --> 38:18.864
