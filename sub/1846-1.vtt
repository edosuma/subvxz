26:42.433 --> 26:46.644
- What if I lose?
- You're fired.

26:46.645 --> 26:47.189
Call me.

26:56.405 --> 27:01.405
Enjoy your flight home.

27:24.600 --> 27:27.810
Tiger Chen!

27:27.811 --> 27:30.229
Where were you yesterday?!

27:30.230 --> 27:33.816
Sorry, sir. Sorry.

27:33.817 --> 27:37.612
This may be just a job to
you, but this is my career!

27:37.613 --> 27:39.906
Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.

27:39.907 --> 27:42.200
Did you even hear me?!

27:42.201 --> 27:47.201
Sorry sir, I'm sorry!

27:48.457 --> 27:52.418
(PHONE RINGS)

27:52.419 --> 27:56.214
Hello. Master?

27:56.215 --> 28:01.215
I'm on my way!

28:22.825 --> 28:25.034
Master...

28:25.035 --> 28:30.035
They say the temple isn't safe...
Is it true? Here.

28:34.670 --> 28:37.171
Safety code violations...?

28:37.172 --> 28:42.172
This is a 30-day
eviction notice!

28:42.886 --> 28:47.682
The universe is blind to our
pain, and deaf to our sorrow.

28:47.683 --> 28:50.101
All things have their way.

28:50.102 --> 28:54.480
I understand, Master.
But I don't accept it.

28:54.481 --> 28:59.481
We can fight this.

29:10.122 --> 29:15.122
The developers submitted a
petition for redevelopment.

29:15.794 --> 29:17.587
They want to knock
down the temple.

29:17.588 --> 29:19.881
But it's the birthplace
of Ling Kong Tai Chi!

29:19.882 --> 29:24.882
600 years! 21 generations!

29:25.012 --> 29:29.932
600 years!

29:29.933 --> 29:32.894
We could use that!

29:32.895 --> 29:35.730
We can block them with a
heritage preservation petition.

29:35.731 --> 29:40.318
What do you mean?

29:40.319 --> 29:43.446
Fill this out. Tell us about
Ling Kong Temple's history,

29:43.447 --> 29:47.450
and explain why
it's worth saving.

29:47.451 --> 29:49.660
But Tiger,

29:49.661 --> 29:52.914
if you don't fix the
violations within 3O days,

29:52.915 --> 29:54.624
you will lose the temple.

29:54.625 --> 29:59.625
How much will all this cost?

30:01.673 --> 30:02.173
A lot.

30:15.479 --> 30:18.898
- <i>(TIGER ON PHONE) Mr. Donaka Mark.</i>

30:18.899 --> 30:23.899

33:17.577 --> 33:22.577
I'll go take a look?

33:23.291 --> 33:28.291
Hi, can I help you?
No problem.

Hey, Tiger! I'm Gong.

36:07.706 --> 36:10.457
Man, I need to shake your hand.

36:10.458 --> 36:13.127
Who are they? What
are they doing?

36:13.128 --> 36:15.838
What, those? For your fans.

36:15.839 --> 36:17.881
What do you mean, my fans?
People watch?

36:17.882 --> 36:21.760
The world over, Tiger. They love it.
They love you.

36:21.761 --> 36:24.680
No, no one ever said anything
about showing the fights.

36:24.681 --> 36:26.390
Hey, don't worry about it, man.

36:26.391 --> 36:28.767
It don't get screened
in China, just overseas

36:28.768 --> 36:30.644
to a very select few group.

36:30.645 --> 36:32.771
I thought this was private.
I thought...

36:32.772 --> 36:34.148
It is. Don't worry about it.

36:34.149 --> 36:35.941
Look, it's like pay-per-view.

36:35.942 --> 36:38.694
People pay to see the
fight, that simple.

36:38.695 --> 36:41.530
And right now, T-man,
you are the star!

36:41.531 --> 36:46.531
- Were they always watching?
- Does it matter?

36:52.876 --> 36:56.962
Is that what you fought for?

36:56.963 --> 36:58.881
Yes.

36:58.882 --> 37:01.925
Is that why you won?

37:01.926 --> 37:03.385
No.

37:03.386 --> 37:08.386
- Why'd you win?
- Because I'm better.

37:26.576 --> 37:27.076
Slower.

37:31.373 --> 37:36.373
Even slower.

37:38.421 --> 37:41.423
What have you been doing?

37:41.424 --> 37:43.008
Working.

37:43.009 --> 37:47.096
What kind of work?

37:47.097 --> 37:51.225
Have you been fighting?

37:51.226 --> 37:55.187
For the temple.

37:55.188 --> 37:59.233
So when the temple's fixed,
and you've tasted blood,

37:59.234 --> 38:04.234
what then?

38:05.031 --> 38:08.033
You must meditate.

38:08.034 --> 38:09.993
Why?

38:09.994 --> 38:12.329
To clear your mind,

38:12.330 --> 38:17.330
guide your Chi and gain control.

38:17.419 --> 38:18.836
I have control.

38:18.837 --> 38:23.132
No, you have power, not control.

38:23.133 --> 38:25.592
Power is control.

38:25.593 --> 38:27.344
That is an illusion.

38:27.345 --> 38:31.640
It is not an illusion,
it's reality.

38:31.641 --> 38:34.810
I live in it, you don't.

38:34.811 --> 38:39.811
What I learn in here, I
can't use out there.

38:42.360 --> 38:46.488
How can you use what you
have not yet learned?

38:46.489 --> 38:50.492
Only when you've dispelled
these illusions,

38:50.493 --> 38:54.830
will you find your way again.

38:54.831 --> 38:59.831
(GRUNTING)

39:07.510 --> 39:12.510
I'm not lost.

39:27.947 --> 39:32.947
What's the number?

39:36.080 --> 39:41.080
Good, they like him.

39:46.424 --> 39:51.424
First round. Ready? Fight!

Stop.

40:41.896 --> 40:46.896
- One, two.
- (Cheering, applause)

40:47.360 --> 40:51.196
Seven, eight!

40:51.197 --> 40:53.782
Incredible!

40:53.783 --> 40:58.078
Tiger knocked out the Sanshou
Champion, and it looked so easy!

40:58.079 --> 41:00.789
How did he do it?

41:00.790 --> 41:05.790
He used soft style
in a hard way.

41:06.588 --> 41:10.132
Soft and hard? That sounds
like a contradiction.

41:10.133 --> 41:15.012
No, no, no, no.

41:15.013 --> 41:18.390
This is Gong, live from
Beijing Championship Hall,

41:18.391 --> 41:20.809
signing off from another
fantastic fight,

41:20.810 --> 41:25.810
where our T-man, man of tai
chi, was once again outrageous.

41:29.527 --> 41:34.527
He has it in him.

41:37.702 --> 41:42.702
(CHUCKLES)

42:13.363 --> 42:17.574
So this place is a
firetrap, right?

42:17.575 --> 42:22.575
Not anymore.

42:29.087 --> 42:29.631
Not bad.

42:33.591 --> 42:38.591
Well played... but
this isn't over.

42:39.055 --> 42:41.181
What do you think?

42:41.182 --> 42:46.182
We'll see.

42:53.903 --> 42:57.406
Don't worry. Once we get the
heritage preservation order,

42:57.407 --> 43:02.407
there's nothing they can do.

43:36.154 --> 43:40.949
- Dad, how's the new television?
- Better than the old one!

43:40.950 --> 43:42.576
That's good.

43:42.577 --> 43:47.577
Tiger, your favorite: Fish-taste pork.
Eat up!

43:49.125 --> 43:51.168
"Fish-taste pork"?

43:51.169 --> 43:53.003
With rice, too?

43:53.004 --> 43:54.963
Damn, I'm hungry right now, man.

43:54.964 --> 43:59.964
(PHONE RINGING)

44:00.887 --> 44:04.181
It's work. I'll be right back.

44:04.182 --> 44:06.433
Quickly.

44:09.312 --> 44:14.312

- <i>What time?</i>
- <i>Six P.M.</i>

44:20.698 --> 44:25.698
<i>See you tomorrow.</i>

44:30.708 --> 44:33.210
- Hurry, the food's getting cold.
- Okay.

44:33.211 --> 44:38.211
- Is everything all right?
- Everything's fine.

44:43.387 --> 44:48.387

45:23.261 --> 45:28.261
Does it matter?

45:28.683 --> 45:33.683

are all those people?

Get yourself ready.

48:05.297 --> 48:08.842
Here I am tonight with
my man Tiger Chen,

48:08.843 --> 48:11.553
just before the fight. What
you got to say, Tiger?

48:11.554 --> 48:16.349
Tell our audience how you feel.
Are you ready?

48:16.350 --> 48:21.350
- Yes.
- All right, he's ready!

48:26.485 --> 48:28.319
Good evening.

48:28.320 --> 48:33.320
It is my honor to introduce
to you, Tiger Chen...

48:38.039 --> 48:43.039
...and his opponents Zian...

48:44.503 --> 48:49.503
...and Zihou.

48:54.805 --> 48:58.808
A fine line separates a
fighter from a warrior.

48:58.809 --> 49:03.229
One is motivated by reason,
the other by purpose.

49:03.230 --> 49:07.150
Tonight, we witness
this distinction

49:07.151 --> 49:12.151
as our contestants battle to
prove who and what they are.

49:13.866 --> 49:14.366

He's getting killed
out there, boss.

51:20.659 --> 51:23.745
I thought you wanted
him to go all the way.

51:23.746 --> 51:28.746
He has to learn.

51:57.696 --> 52:00.198
What's the matter?

52:00.199 --> 52:05.199
You afraid of what
you can do to them?

52:06.705 --> 52:07.317
Don't be.

54:38.232 --> 54:43.232

54:44.738 --> 54:47.657
These two unique styles
are fighting to decide

54:47.658 --> 54:51.077
who will advance to
the final round.

54:51.078 --> 54:53.413
<i>In Wu Lin, styles don't
matter, skills do.</i>

<i>But whose skills are stronger?</i>

<i>The answer! Right now!</i>

55:04.049 --> 55:08.678

55:08.679 --> 55:11.472
Your student is about to fight.

55:11.473 --> 55:14.934
Looks like a sure win to me.

55:14.935 --> 55:18.187
(GONG) Our hero, Tiger
Chen, fighting today.

55:18.188 --> 55:23.188
A knockout artist, a punisher.
The crane.

55:23.610 --> 55:26.237
Will Tiger survive?

55:26.238 --> 55:27.738
<i>Let's find out.</i>

55:27.739 --> 55:32.739
Here are the rules.

55:36.498 --> 55:41.498
First round! Ready, fight!

55:42.421 --> 55:42.921
Stop!

55:51.013 --> 55:53.222
BLUE SIDE: Ready?

55:53.223 --> 55:53.723
Begin!

55:57.519 --> 56:01.606
Tiger Chen, what are you doing?!

56:01.607 --> 56:05.318
Tiger Chen has violated the
spirit of this competition!

56:05.319 --> 56:07.361
What was that? What
style was that?

56:07.362 --> 56:09.405
His own.

56:09.406 --> 56:14.406
He's lost his mind,
as if he's possessed.

56:17.039 --> 56:20.249
Was that tai chi?

56:20.250 --> 56:21.834
Is that tai chi?

56:21.835 --> 56:25.421
He should be disqualified.
The cruelty!

56:25.422 --> 56:30.422
Boss, this guy's a killer.

56:31.762 --> 56:32.929
Tiger Chen.

56:32.930 --> 56:36.557
The referee is
making the decision.

56:36.558 --> 56:38.893
Disqualified! He has
been disqualified!

56:38.894 --> 56:42.063
Tiger Chen and Ling Kong Tai Chi
are out of the Championship!

56:42.064 --> 56:45.358
Li-Hung, stop him! Ask
him why he did this.

56:45.359 --> 56:49.028
Tiger, what happened?
Tell us why you did this.

56:49.029 --> 56:51.864
Is it because you were possessed
like Master Ding said?

56:51.865 --> 56:53.908
<i>Could you say something?</i>

56:53.909 --> 56:58.909
<i>Tiger, where are you going?</i>

57:01.333 --> 57:06.333
(yells, echoes)

59:21.598 --> 59:22.142
(GRUNTS)

59:39.032 --> 59:42.827
You have improved quickly...

59:42.828 --> 59:45.454
I don't need meditation.

59:45.455 --> 59:47.957
...At fighting.

59:47.958 --> 59:51.919
But is that all you want to be?

59:51.920 --> 59:56.920
Tiger, you are free
to walk this path,

59:57.467 --> 01:00:01.554
but without meditation,

01:00:01.555 --> 01:00:06.555
this path will only
lead to destruction.

01:00:19.656 --> 01:00:24.656

01:01:41.530 --> 01:01:44.323
They're all encrypted
with the same signature.

01:01:44.324 --> 01:01:45.950
Can you crack them?

01:01:45.951 --> 01:01:50.955
It's possible, but
I'm not authorized.

01:01:50.956 --> 01:01:53.999
Could you give me the signal's
location if it appears again?

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.543
I can do that.

- No unauthorized signal tracking.
- I don't have time...

01:19:55.915 --> 01:19:58.833
I'm not authorized! Superintendent
Wong told me I can't...

01:19:58.834 --> 01:20:03.671
- Wong?
- Yes, he said no one can...

01:20:03.672 --> 01:20:06.883
Are you tracking or not?

01:20:06.884 --> 01:20:08.801
Really...?

01:20:08.802 --> 01:20:13.802
Jing Si could die.

01:20:19.730 --> 01:20:24.730
Let the show begin.

01:20:35.704 --> 01:20:39.499

01:21:18.205 --> 01:21:18.705
Enjoy.

01:21:36.724 --> 01:21:40.268
I won't fight you.

01:21:40.269 --> 01:21:44.480
I won't fight you.

01:21:44.481 --> 01:21:49.481
I won't fight you.

01:21:49.987 --> 01:21:53.948
I won't fight you.

01:21:53.949 --> 01:21:58.949
I won't...

01:22:03.375 --> 01:22:08.375
I'll fight you.

01:22:15.846 --> 01:22:20.846
I'll fight you!
I'll fight you!

01:22:29.526 --> 01:22:34.526
I won't fight you.

01:22:39.411 --> 01:22:44.411
I'll fight you.

01:22:45.918 --> 01:22:46.530
Kill him.

01:23:40.222 --> 01:23:40.834
(YELLING)

01:23:48.772 --> 01:23:51.691
Go.

01:23:51.692 --> 01:23:56.692
You owe me a life.

01:24:05.914 --> 01:24:08.416
<i>(MAN OVER LOUDSPEAKER) This
is the Hong Kong police.</i>

01:24:08.417 --> 01:24:11.294
- <i>You are surrounded.</i>
- <i>Go, go, go.</i>

01:24:11.295 --> 01:24:15.631
<i>Everyone here, please remain
calm and stay where you are.</i>

01:24:15.632 --> 01:24:16.799
Freeze!

01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:21.596
<i>Do not move until given
clear instructions.</i>

01:24:21.597 --> 01:24:24.974
Get down!

01:24:24.975 --> 01:24:29.975
No problem, I give up!

01:24:35.903 --> 01:24:40.698
Sir, this way.

01:24:40.699 --> 01:24:43.701
I'll still be your boss
in your next life.

01:24:43.702 --> 01:24:48.702
Why not be my mother?

01:24:49.750 --> 01:24:51.500
<i>(OFFICER) Please take
out your identification</i>

01:24:51.501 --> 01:24:53.836
<i>and state the reason
why you are here.</i>

01:24:53.837 --> 01:24:56.505
Donaka? Did you get him?

01:24:56.506 --> 01:24:59.842
Not yet, but he won't get far.

01:24:59.843 --> 01:25:03.095
You're safe now. It's all over.

01:25:03.096 --> 01:25:04.847
So what now?

01:25:04.848 --> 01:25:09.810
We'll get your statement,
then you're a free man.

01:25:09.811 --> 01:25:11.938
Thank you.

01:25:11.939 --> 01:25:16.939
Take him to the station.

01:25:20.489 --> 01:25:25.489
<i>Suspect not found.
Setting road block.</i>

01:27:39.169 --> 01:27:41.796
You owe me a life.

01:27:41.797 --> 01:27:46.797
(GRUNTING)

01:27:49.012 --> 01:27:50.971
Fight me.

01:27:50.972 --> 01:27:55.972
(GRUNTING)

01:29:21.062 --> 01:29:26.062
- Show me.
- (YELLS)

01:29:52.969 --> 01:29:53.513
Show me.

01:30:13.782 --> 01:30:17.034
Do you know who you are, Tiger?

01:30:17.035 --> 01:30:20.162
Do you know what you are?

01:30:20.163 --> 01:30:20.707
(GRUNTS)

01:31:53.548 --> 01:31:58.548
You're nothing.

01:32:13.234 --> 01:32:18.234
I am nothing.

01:32:19.824 --> 01:32:24.824
You owe me a life.

01:32:26.373 --> 01:32:31.373
(GRUNTING)

01:33:31.146 --> 01:33:34.565
(GRUNTING)

01:33:34.566 --> 01:33:39.566
(GRUNTING MOANING)

01:34:05.054 --> 01:34:07.973
(PANTING)

01:34:07.974 --> 01:34:12.974
I knew you had it in you.

01:34:53.019 --> 01:34:53.519
Tiger.

01:34:57.106 --> 01:34:57.718
Master...

01:35:34.644 --> 01:35:39.565
- What do we have?
- We found an informant.

01:35:39.566 --> 01:35:44.566
To reach a destination,
there are many paths.

01:35:46.364 --> 01:35:51.364
The traditional and the modern
can coexist in harmony.

01:35:51.661 --> 01:35:55.831
I thank Tiger for his hard work,

01:35:55.832 --> 01:36:00.832
that unites us here today.

01:36:08.469 --> 01:36:10.721
Thank you for coming,

01:36:10.722 --> 01:36:15.722
and may all of you
find your true path.

01:36:20.440 --> 01:36:25.440
I'm here at the Ling Kong Temple,
with its legacy of 600 years.

01:36:25.612 --> 01:36:29.781
Letu Realty and UPCS plan to
establish a cultural village.

01:36:29.782 --> 01:36:32.117
You did it.

01:36:32.118 --> 01:36:36.330
We did it.

01:36:36.331 --> 01:36:38.165
What are you going to do now?

01:36:38.166 --> 01:36:43.166
I'm going to open a school in the city...
and teach.

01:36:44.005 --> 01:36:48.508
You're going to be a real
tai chi teacher now?

01:36:48.509 --> 01:36:50.928
Call me "Master".

01:36:50.929 --> 01:36:55.807
We'll see who teaches who.

01:36:55.808 --> 01:36:58.226
- Come on, I want to show you something.
- Where?

01:36:58.227 --> 01:37:03.227
You'll know when we arrive.

01:37:19.040 --> 01:37:22.626
(yelling, echoes)

01:37:22.627 --> 01:37:23.171
