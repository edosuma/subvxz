Ruiz: Laura Hayes, Fort Worth, Texas.

19:25.927 --> 19:27.595
This says you're a promotions manager.

19:27.629 --> 19:28.929
Is that right?

19:28.964 --> 19:30.498
You ready to talk to us, Laura?

19:31.967 --> 19:34.535
What were you thinking,

19:34.569 --> 19:36.837
taking off and leaving your children?

19:36.872 --> 19:38.906
I wasn't leaving my children.

19:38.940 --> 19:41.075
I'd never abandon them.

19:41.109 --> 19:42.777
They're all I have left in this world.

19:42.811 --> 19:45.446
Let's talk about you and Daniel.

19:45.480 --> 19:47.248
How long were you guys having an affair?

19:47.282 --> 19:49.350
Two years, I guess.

19:49.384 --> 19:51.018
But I swear, at the
time when we started,

19:51.052 --> 19:52.052
I didn't know he was married.

19:52.087 --> 19:54.855
I wish I could go back and
make a different choice.

19:54.890 --> 19:56.690
At the time, I-I felt
like I needed more,

19:56.725 --> 19:57.691
like I deserved more.

19:57.726 --> 20:01.061
But you did find out he
was married eventually,

20:01.096 --> 20:02.296
- right?
- I did.

20:02.330 --> 20:05.032
His wife, she found out about
us around that same time, too.

20:05.066 --> 20:06.367
She filed for divorce.

20:06.401 --> 20:07.802
I begged her to reconsider,

20:07.836 --> 20:09.737
if not for us, for the
sake of the children.

20:09.771 --> 20:12.206
I told her I'd break it off, and I did.

20:12.240 --> 20:15.576
He comes to me and he says he
needs to fight for his family.

20:15.610 --> 20:16.710
All the promises,

20:16.745 --> 20:19.814
all the plans we made, just gone,

I shouldn't have lied to you before.

20:24.019 --> 20:25.619
I-I wasn't thinking straight.

I thought I could talk to
Laura, convince her to...

Clara: The car that you were driving

20:36.298 --> 20:38.799
was a rental car you
picked up in Fort Worth.

20:38.834 --> 20:44.171
So you drove 1,500 miles
to do what exactly?

20:44.206 --> 20:45.639
I don't know. I wanted
to come down here

20:45.674 --> 20:48.609
and blow up his life like he had mine.

20:48.643 --> 20:51.111
Phone records say you were
still in touch with Laura

20:51.146 --> 20:53.147
and that you gave her
one of your phones.

20:53.181 --> 20:54.982
I was still juggling.

20:55.016 --> 20:57.084
I was hoping this trip
would fix everything.

20:57.118 --> 20:58.986
Then Jessica found out
that Laura was calling me.

20:59.020 --> 21:00.821
What she didn't know is
that Laura had followed us

21:00.856 --> 21:01.856
all the way down here.

21:01.890 --> 21:03.157
Got a motel room,

21:03.191 --> 21:06.193
called Dan a few times,

21:06.228 --> 21:09.697
and then, around midnight,
I called one more time.

21:09.731 --> 21:10.764
You're gonna meet me.

21:10.799 --> 21:12.466
You're gonna meet me at
the boardwalk in an hour.

21:12.501 --> 21:13.968
I'm headed over there, okay?

21:14.002 --> 21:15.469
And I threatened him,

21:15.504 --> 21:18.606
told him I'd come over if
he didn't come see me.

21:18.640 --> 21:20.274
She wanted to meet me at the boardwalk.

21:20.308 --> 21:21.809
I didn't have a choice. I had to go.

21:22.978 --> 21:24.311
And when I hung up the phone,

21:24.346 --> 21:25.846
I caught my reflection in the mirror,

21:25.881 --> 21:28.349
and I didn't even recognize myself.

21:28.383 --> 21:30.885
I mean, how did I become
this crazy stalker?

21:30.919 --> 21:33.988
I felt so much guilt and shame.

21:34.022 --> 21:36.991
Wasn't even like I
decided not to see him.

21:37.025 --> 21:38.459
I just passed out.

21:38.493 --> 21:40.561
Laura never showed up. I called her.

21:40.595 --> 21:42.963
Never heard anything, so I
went back to the villa.

21:42.998 --> 21:44.999
What time was that?

21:45.033 --> 21:46.100
Quarter after 2:00 in the morning.

21:46.134 --> 21:49.703
And you didn't think to check
on Jessica at the time?

21:49.738 --> 21:51.639
I did. I checked the bedroom.

21:51.673 --> 21:54.041
The door was locked. I figured
she was pissed at me.

21:54.075 --> 21:55.709
I got up at 4:00 a.m. to check again.

21:55.744 --> 21:57.011
This time, the door was unlocked,

21:57.045 --> 21:57.912
and Jessica was gone.

21:57.946 --> 22:00.047
I might have been
jealous of that woman,

22:00.081 --> 22:01.081
but I didn't kill her.

22:01.116 --> 22:03.984
I swear I didn't kill my wife.

I will you tell you without hesitation

that, Daniel,

that helps Daniel.

23:01.776 --> 23:02.743

were meant to cover up

and God ripped him away from me.

38:29.538 --> 38:35.510
Afterwards, I was just
consumed with rage.

38:35.544 --> 38:37.312
I was his most faithful servant.

38:37.346 --> 38:38.947
[Panting]

38:38.981 --> 38:40.148
Why take my Matthew?

38:40.182 --> 38:44.319
I asked myself the exact same
question when I lost Brad.

38:44.353 --> 38:48.089
All of that pain, it is...

38:48.123 --> 38:49.991
it is overwhelming, isn't it?

38:50.025 --> 38:52.026
It burns.

38:52.061 --> 38:54.429
And that's why you felt the need

38:54.463 --> 38:56.998
to take the lives of those boys

38:57.032 --> 39:00.468
because each time you
took one from this world,

39:00.502 --> 39:02.437
you thought that it
would stop that pain.

39:02.471 --> 39:04.439
But it didn't, did it?

39:04.473 --> 39:07.141
All of these acts of vengeance,

39:07.176 --> 39:10.845
they do nothing to quell the
agony of Matthew's death.

39:10.879 --> 39:13.348
It's not fair.

39:13.382 --> 39:15.216
- Matthew was innocent.
- Yes.

39:15.250 --> 39:17.652
Yes, he was,

39:17.686 --> 39:20.188
just like Ryan, just
like that little boy

39:20.222 --> 39:22.290
that you are holding in
your arms right now.

39:22.324 --> 39:24.058
No. He's been chosen.

39:24.093 --> 39:26.461
Rafael, I want you to listen to me.

39:26.495 --> 39:28.162
Remember what it says in proverbs...

39:28.197 --> 39:32.200
"let not mercy and truth forsake thee.

39:32.234 --> 39:34.869
Bind them upon thy neck.

39:34.903 --> 39:38.740
Write them on the table
with your heart."

39:38.774 --> 39:43.011
Rafael, do you know why God
writes his words in your heart?

39:43.045 --> 39:45.646
So that when your heart breaks,

39:45.681 --> 39:48.316
his words, they fall in.

39:48.350 --> 39:50.351
[Sobbing]

40:02.464 --> 40:05.166
I'm forsaken.

40:05.200 --> 40:07.468
It's over, Rafael. Put
your hands on your head.

40:15.944 --> 40:17.245
- [Car door closes]
- Dad. Dad.

40:17.279 --> 40:19.047
[Sobbing]

40:20.983 --> 40:23.618
Oh, my babies. My babies, I missed you.

40:23.652 --> 40:25.586
You're a lucky man, Daniel.

40:25.621 --> 40:27.555
Not too many people
get a second chance,

40:27.589 --> 40:29.290
a shot at redemption.

40:29.324 --> 40:30.892
I'm not sure I deserve it,

40:30.926 --> 40:33.061
but maybe I got it because of my kids.

40:37.099 --> 40:39.100
♪

40:51.847 --> 40:55.049
- [Sighs]
- You did great work today.

40:56.652 --> 40:58.252
Thank you.

40:58.287 --> 40:59.620
But...

40:59.655 --> 41:00.488
But what?

41:02.591 --> 41:05.660
And I thought Brad had
a bad poker face.

41:05.694 --> 41:08.329
Yours is so much worse.

41:08.363 --> 41:09.664
Is that right?

41:09.698 --> 41:11.132
Yeah.

41:14.369 --> 41:17.105
You cut open a pretty deep scar today

41:17.139 --> 41:21.142
in order to talk down Rafael Acosta.

41:21.176 --> 41:23.344
Oh, believe me, I didn't want to.

41:23.378 --> 41:26.047
But there's nothing
else I could have done.

41:28.517 --> 41:31.486
You gonna be all right?

41:31.520 --> 41:33.254
You know, when Brad died,

41:33.288 --> 41:36.157
it dawned on me for the very first time

41:36.191 --> 41:39.260
why every orthodox faith on this planet

41:39.294 --> 41:42.363
has these strict timelines and rituals

41:42.397 --> 41:45.266
for how you're supposed
to mourn the dead

41:45.300 --> 41:48.769
and move on with the living.

41:48.804 --> 41:53.307
You violate those customs,
you dishonor the dead.

41:53.342 --> 41:55.877
As well as the living.

41:55.911 --> 41:59.647
There has to be a time to grieve.

41:59.681 --> 42:01.983
And a time to move on.

42:04.186 --> 42:05.786
I'm really glad you're back.

42:07.022 --> 42:09.557
Me, too.

42:09.591 --> 42:11.192
So let's go home.
