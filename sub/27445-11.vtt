WEBVTT

00:01.035 --> 00:02.236
This is pretty macabre.

00:03.171 --> 00:04.172
(scoffs)

00:05.106 --> 00:06.374
(exclaims, screams)

00:06.407 --> 00:07.975
What We Do in the Shadows,

00:08.008 --> 00:10.744
all new Wednesdays at 10:00
on FX.

00:13.214 --> 00:16.350
FXX presents You're the Worst.

01:03.063 --> 01:04.198
Soda water.

01:04.232 --> 01:06.066
-Lime wedge?
-Nah.

01:06.100 --> 01:08.402
Who am I trying to fool?

01:08.436 --> 01:10.070
Hey there.

01:11.605 --> 01:13.407
Hi.

01:13.441 --> 01:15.809
-Are you staying at the hotel?
-I am.

01:15.843 --> 01:17.545
Yeah, me, too, you know.

01:17.578 --> 01:19.980
I'm, uh, I'm Curtis.

01:20.013 --> 01:21.715
Gretchen.

01:21.749 --> 01:24.585
Wow. I don't think I've ever
actually met a Gretchen.

01:24.618 --> 01:27.388
Well, Curtis, now you have.

01:27.421 --> 01:29.357
Yes, I have.
(laughs)

01:31.692 --> 01:34.128
So, uh, are you...
are you here alone,

01:34.162 --> 01:36.430
or...?

01:36.464 --> 01:38.999
Yes, I... I am alone.

01:39.032 --> 01:41.135
(laughs)
Uh...

01:41.169 --> 01:45.173
I-I guess what I'm asking
in a larger sense is...

01:45.206 --> 01:46.940
single?

01:46.974 --> 01:50.043
Are you, uh...
are you single?

01:52.380 --> 01:54.315
Single like a fox.

01:54.348 --> 01:58.586
Although, I did almost
get married once.

01:58.619 --> 02:01.589
Oh. Almost.

02:01.622 --> 02:05.393
Well, I mean, would you want to
tell me the story over a drink?

02:09.163 --> 02:10.464
Aw, fuck it.

02:10.498 --> 02:12.633
Whiskey, rocks.

02:12.666 --> 02:15.236
You live exactly once,
right, Curtis?

02:21.542 --> 02:24.778
* I'm gonna leave you anyway *

02:24.812 --> 02:27.815
* I'm gonna leave you
anyway *

02:27.848 --> 02:30.418
* Gonna leave you anyway. *

02:42.863 --> 02:44.865
(crushing pills)

02:50.438 --> 02:52.573
(snorting)

02:52.606 --> 02:54.542
(sniffs hard)

02:55.876 --> 02:57.177
(sighs)

02:57.211 --> 02:59.647
JIMMY: Okay, the final options
for Gretchen's

02:59.680 --> 03:01.349
Walk Down the Aisle music.

03:01.382 --> 03:03.984
"Tubthumping" by Chumbawamba,
"Juicy," Biggie,

03:04.017 --> 03:05.519
"Poison" by Bell Biv DeVoe.

03:05.553 --> 03:08.656
As Shakespeare said, "Never
trust a big butt and a smile."

03:08.689 --> 03:10.157
"Freak on a Leash" by Korn,

03:10.190 --> 03:12.226
-"Marry Me" by Train.
-Oh, nix that one.

03:12.260 --> 03:14.595
I don't want to ruin my mascara
crying too hard.

03:14.628 --> 03:16.264
"Sweet Child of Mine," GNR,

03:16.297 --> 03:17.931
"Relax" by Frankie Goes
To Hollywood.

03:17.965 --> 03:20.067
-You do know that's
about butt sex?
-I do.

03:20.100 --> 03:21.569
Madonna, "Like A Virgin,"

03:21.602 --> 03:24.338
"2 Become 1," Spice Girls.
Aw.

03:24.372 --> 03:27.708
"Sabotage," Beastie Boys,
"Waterfalls," TLC.

03:27.741 --> 03:29.943
Oh, too sad. AIDS.
Change it to "No Scrubs."

03:29.977 --> 03:32.913
"Pop That Pussy"
by 2 Live Crew,

03:32.946 --> 03:35.048

03:37.050 --> 03:38.352

03:38.386 --> 03:40.588
-Great list.
-Greatest list.

03:40.621 --> 03:41.922
So, shall we winnow it down?

03:41.955 --> 03:43.257
Oh, gonna have to winnow
lata, playa.

03:43.291 --> 03:45.526
I have to head into the office

03:45.559 --> 03:48.696
before the shitstorm
du jour starts. Oh!

03:48.729 --> 03:51.031
Aw, damn it!

03:51.064 --> 03:53.801
Calgon, right?

03:53.834 --> 03:55.436
Anyway, office drahms.

03:55.469 --> 03:58.138
Debbie's inner-ear problem
is flaring up,

03:58.171 --> 03:59.707
so she's always weaving
when she walks.

03:59.740 --> 04:02.643
And Mike's cat's butt is jacked

04:02.676 --> 04:04.578
after she had
all those baby cats.

04:04.612 --> 04:06.380
Blah, blah, blah.
Work shit.

04:06.414 --> 04:09.917
Yeah, yeah, mi-might I remind
you that your first wedding

04:09.950 --> 04:12.953
is but five days away,

04:12.986 --> 04:15.323
and we still need to choose
the font for the name cards

04:15.356 --> 04:18.258
and pick a punny name
for our signature cocktail.

04:18.292 --> 04:20.127
And we're totally gonna do
all that bullshit,

04:20.160 --> 04:22.930
but again, supes swamped
at wiz-erk.

04:22.963 --> 04:25.399
Yeah, no, that's actually fine,
'cause Edgar and I

04:25.433 --> 04:28.802
have our notes "phoner"
with the studio today.

04:28.836 --> 04:32.072
Because we finished the script.
Which I told you about already.

04:32.105 --> 04:35.175
At which time
your reaction was similarly,

04:35.208 --> 04:36.610
dishearteningly muted.

04:36.644 --> 04:39.079
Cool, bud. See ya.

04:39.112 --> 04:41.014
Huh.

04:41.048 --> 04:43.317
What?

04:43.351 --> 04:44.785
Oh, nothing.

04:44.818 --> 04:46.119
It just doesn't seem like

04:46.153 --> 04:48.789
-Gretchen's very excited
about the wedding.
-Edgar.

04:48.822 --> 04:51.959
As clearly evidenced
by not even having time

04:51.992 --> 04:54.928
to close the front door,
Gretchen is incredibly busy

04:54.962 --> 04:57.598
with important work things.

04:57.631 --> 05:00.368
* Hey *

05:00.401 --> 05:03.771
* We go to work, work, work,
work, work, work, work *

05:03.804 --> 05:08.108
* We go to work, work,
work, work, work, work, work *

05:08.141 --> 05:09.176
* We go to work *

05:11.011 --> 05:14.448
* If you want it,
come and get it *

05:14.482 --> 05:17.685
* We'll break you off some,
we'll break you off some *

05:17.718 --> 05:21.021
* Say yeah *

05:21.054 --> 05:22.890
* We ain't come to play around *

05:22.923 --> 05:24.458
* No, no, no *

05:24.492 --> 05:26.193
* We ain't come to play around *

05:26.226 --> 05:28.562
* No, no, no *

05:28.596 --> 05:30.163
* If you can't take the heat *

05:30.197 --> 05:31.999
* Then get out the kitchen *

05:32.032 --> 05:35.202
* If you can't take the heat,
then get out, get out *

05:35.235 --> 05:38.506
* Say yeah *

05:38.539 --> 05:40.307
* Work, work, work,
come on *

05:40.340 --> 05:42.410
* Work, work, work, yes *

05:42.443 --> 05:44.111
* Yeah, yeah. *

05:49.216 --> 05:51.919
(hold music playing)

05:54.722 --> 05:55.689
(music stops)

05:55.723 --> 05:58.158
-Hi.
-Hey, everybody.

05:58.191 --> 06:00.828
Hey, guys. Sheila here.

06:00.861 --> 06:02.730
Uh, hi, Sheila.

06:02.763 --> 06:05.265
We just... Are we just waiting
for everyone else, or...?

06:05.298 --> 06:07.234
SHEILA:
Uh, we just wanted to say

06:07.267 --> 06:10.270
you two did a great job.

06:10.303 --> 06:13.373
Hey, Sheila, it's Edgar.

06:13.407 --> 06:15.909
We're just a little confused.

06:15.943 --> 06:17.511
Isn't this a notes call?

06:17.545 --> 06:20.180
Yeah, it sounds like
our wires got crossed.

06:20.213 --> 06:23.417
No, we're all set.
Again, amazing work.

06:23.451 --> 06:25.886
So, then, th-the next step
would be...?

06:25.919 --> 06:27.621
Absolutely.
Take care, guys.

06:27.655 --> 06:29.289
(line disconnects,
dial tone drones)

06:29.322 --> 06:30.424
(disconnect chime)

06:34.595 --> 06:37.465
No notes? Boom!

06:37.498 --> 06:38.899
I don't know, Jimmy.

06:38.932 --> 06:41.301
No notes isn't really a thing,
remember?

06:41.334 --> 06:43.203
I'm gonna call my agent.

06:43.236 --> 06:46.039
Oh, no, Jimmy.

06:46.073 --> 06:49.276
Check Deadline.

06:50.478 --> 06:51.612
Hi, Grace.

06:51.645 --> 06:55.616
The studio's hired Diablo Cody

06:55.649 --> 06:58.118
to adapt my book?!

06:59.687 --> 07:02.322
But we already wrote it.

07:02.355 --> 07:03.924
KILLIAN: They probably just
kicked you a draft

07:03.957 --> 07:05.893
to keep the relationship good
while you finish

07:05.926 --> 07:07.327
the other two Peach books.

07:07.360 --> 07:08.629
Sort of how Tom gets
"story by" credit

07:08.662 --> 07:09.963
on all the Reachers.

07:09.997 --> 07:12.299
Oh, guess I haven't seen you
in a while, huh?

07:12.332 --> 07:14.935
My dad sobered up
and found religion for us.

07:14.968 --> 07:16.737
Now I get to wear
this cool sailor's costume,

07:16.770 --> 07:18.672
and I live in a room
above a GameStop on Sunset

07:18.706 --> 07:19.673
with four other children.

07:19.707 --> 07:21.642
I left word.

07:21.675 --> 07:23.243
Hey, you know what
I just caught on cable?

07:23.276 --> 07:24.277
Jack Reacher.

07:24.311 --> 07:25.979
It's really good.

07:26.013 --> 07:27.447
You should tell people
it's good.

07:27.481 --> 07:29.249
Can I count on you to
tell people it's good, Jimmy?

07:29.282 --> 07:33.754
Another great living novelist
felled by the studio system,

07:33.787 --> 07:36.490
Like F. Scott Fitzgerald
or Chuck Palahniuk.

07:36.524 --> 07:40.528
How utterly clichÃ©.

07:40.561 --> 07:44.331
Well, at least my better half
is still gainfully employed.

07:49.202 --> 07:50.838
(gasps)

07:50.871 --> 07:52.906
You got the shit?

07:58.478 --> 08:00.213
Why can't I meet you
somewhere normal?

08:00.247 --> 08:01.682
Hit me with the hot work goss.

08:01.715 --> 08:05.686
It turns out, Mike's cat
actually has hemorrhoids.

08:05.719 --> 08:07.688
Debbie took a header
coming out of the bathroom.

08:07.721 --> 08:09.022
(both laugh)

08:09.056 --> 08:11.525
Yvette's still a giant bitch
for firing you.

08:11.559 --> 08:14.327
-How's Toilet?
-How would I know?

08:14.361 --> 08:15.663
He's great. Okay?

08:15.696 --> 08:18.398
Gretch, I can't keep doing this.
I think these papers

08:18.431 --> 08:20.568
you're making me steal
may be important.

08:20.601 --> 08:23.070
If they were so important,
why are they in the trash?

08:23.103 --> 08:25.539
Jimmy's never once
looked at your work stuff.

08:25.573 --> 08:27.007
Why do you need Caliber papers

08:27.040 --> 08:29.242
to make him believe
you weren't canned?

08:29.276 --> 08:30.644
I can't let him know
I am losing it

08:30.678 --> 08:31.712
right before the wedding.

08:31.745 --> 08:33.480
I'll tell him after.

08:33.513 --> 08:35.048
Divorce is so much paperwork.

08:35.082 --> 08:36.316
He'll never get around
to that shit.

08:36.349 --> 08:37.985
Stupid Yvette.

08:38.018 --> 08:40.921
I mean, who fires someone right
before their wedding?

08:41.789 --> 08:43.356
You know what?

08:43.390 --> 08:47.094
I am going to march in there
and chew her ass out for you.

08:47.127 --> 08:49.096
Plus, it's only four episodes,

08:49.129 --> 08:51.599
so we can probably watch
it all tonight.

08:51.632 --> 08:54.602
(gasps)
Ooh. Let's order Thai.

08:54.635 --> 08:57.237
(panting):
Okay. Hey.

08:57.270 --> 08:58.872
You know what else we should do?

08:58.906 --> 09:01.041
-Rehire Gretchen.
-What?

09:05.613 --> 09:07.848
Hey, where'd your butt go?

09:07.881 --> 09:09.850
I understand that Gretchen
is your friend,

09:09.883 --> 09:12.052
but she royally screwed up.

09:12.085 --> 09:14.888
Did she, though?

09:14.922 --> 09:17.390
She set off
a fire alarm to avoid

09:17.424 --> 09:19.593
disappointing
one of her clients.

09:19.627 --> 09:22.195
That is insane.

09:22.229 --> 09:24.965
I feel like you're upset.

09:24.998 --> 09:27.200
So what color curry
should we get tonight?

09:27.234 --> 09:30.203
Yellow? Red? Blue?

09:30.237 --> 09:32.239
-(chuckles)
-Something came up.

09:32.272 --> 09:34.775
Just now?

09:34.808 --> 09:36.810
(quietly):
Okay.

09:45.418 --> 09:48.488
(phone chimes, vibrates)

09:48.521 --> 09:52.125
(whimpering sob)

09:52.159 --> 09:56.930
My own creation,
ripped from my heaving bosom.

09:56.964 --> 10:00.067
-No!
-(phone chimes, vibrates)

10:00.100 --> 10:02.803
Edgar, be a dear and answer
this, will you?

10:02.836 --> 10:04.805
Whoever it is
won't stop calling,

10:04.838 --> 10:06.807
and I'm far too distressed

10:06.840 --> 10:09.009
to synthesize
any sort of cogent thought.

10:09.042 --> 10:11.078
Jimmy's phone. This is Edgar.

10:11.111 --> 10:12.746
-(paper rips)
-Uh-huh, hold on.

10:12.780 --> 10:14.147
The caterer wants
to know if you want

10:14.181 --> 10:16.316
red or white quinoa
in the farro salad.

10:16.349 --> 10:19.252
(moans)

10:19.286 --> 10:21.521
We'll get back to you.

10:21.554 --> 10:22.522
(phone beeps off)

10:22.555 --> 10:24.591
I'm gonna ask Gretchen.

10:24.624 --> 10:26.794
(keys beeping)

10:26.827 --> 10:29.096
-(phone rings)
-Caliber PR.

10:29.129 --> 10:31.164
Uh, hi. Gretchen Cutler's
office, please?

10:34.467 --> 10:35.836
(clears throat)

10:35.869 --> 10:38.538
You are hearing
this prepared statement

10:38.571 --> 10:40.674
because you called
for Gretchen Cutler,

10:40.708 --> 10:43.110
whose employment
was terminated immediately

10:43.143 --> 10:45.178
upon the incident on the 12th.

10:45.212 --> 10:48.849
If Ms. Cutler has personally
injured or assaul...

10:54.521 --> 10:56.289
I left word.

10:56.323 --> 10:58.391
(moaning)

11:03.230 --> 11:06.700
-(lullaby plays softly)
-Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

11:06.734 --> 11:09.069
(quietly):
Good girl.

11:09.102 --> 11:11.939
(lullaby continues)

11:13.340 --> 11:15.075
Time for sleepies.

11:15.108 --> 11:17.711
You get some sleep, okay?
Good night.

11:17.745 --> 11:20.147
(Tallulah whimpering)

11:20.180 --> 11:22.182
Shh...

11:25.118 --> 11:27.721
Hey, you want to help me
find a new apartment?

11:27.755 --> 11:30.991
Bec and I talked Paul into
springing for a sweet Airbnb.

11:31.024 --> 11:33.026
"For the baby." Oops.

11:33.060 --> 11:34.594
I'm supposed
to do the quotes in my head.

11:34.627 --> 11:37.330
-I have a secret.
-Hell, yeah.

11:37.364 --> 11:39.199
Love secrets.
Lay it on me.

11:39.232 --> 11:41.501
I'm a lesbian now.

11:41.534 --> 11:43.570
That's, uh...

11:45.472 --> 11:47.574
That's...

11:47.607 --> 11:49.676
-That's amazing.
-(exhales)

11:49.709 --> 11:52.279
I am so honored that you would
trust me with this. Come here.

11:52.312 --> 11:54.047
Oh.

11:54.081 --> 11:55.382
You outed yourself
to the right hombre.

11:55.415 --> 11:57.217
I'm sort of a lezbo expert.

11:57.250 --> 11:59.386
Not 'cause I'm cranked up
by the idea of two ladies

11:59.419 --> 12:02.122
smushing their titties and boxes
together and whatnots,

12:02.155 --> 12:05.225
-but on account of my two moms.
-Your what, now?

12:05.258 --> 12:08.361
Me being born dead
was mad stressful on my folks.

12:08.395 --> 12:10.363
I survived,
but their marriage didn't.

12:10.397 --> 12:11.865
But it was a stealth blessing

12:11.899 --> 12:13.934
'cause it turns out
my mom is super gay.

12:13.967 --> 12:15.936
And you turned out like this?

12:15.969 --> 12:18.471
Right. That's why I'm so mad
fucking sensitive.

12:18.505 --> 12:20.407
I like Yvette so much.

12:20.440 --> 12:23.944
I've never felt this way about
anyone, not even Dave Navarro.

12:23.977 --> 12:25.478
Plus, I've never dated a woman,

12:25.512 --> 12:27.981
so I don't know
if I'm doing any of this right.

12:28.015 --> 12:30.083
Okay. Let's run through
your relaish right quick.

12:30.117 --> 12:33.586
-Oh.
-(grunts)

12:33.620 --> 12:37.424
-When was your last hike?
-Never.

12:37.457 --> 12:40.093
Which Costco do you guys
belong to together?

12:40.127 --> 12:42.095
-None.
-Have you seen Fun Home?

12:42.129 --> 12:44.297
-Huh?
-How many flannels do you own?

12:44.331 --> 12:46.599
-Uh...
-Which Subaru
have you test-driven?

12:46.633 --> 12:49.402
-Zero.
-How much did you donate
to NPR last year?

12:49.436 --> 12:50.971
What's NPR?

12:51.004 --> 12:52.405
What's your favorite
Tegan and Sara album?

12:52.439 --> 12:55.809
-Who?
-Has she made you a chili?

12:55.843 --> 12:58.611
-What?
-A chili-- beans, meat,
a tomato base.

12:58.645 --> 13:01.514
-A chili, goddamn it.
-We haven't made a chili.

13:01.548 --> 13:03.183
That's it!

13:03.216 --> 13:04.852
You need to do something
to let her know

13:04.885 --> 13:08.021
that you're serious
about being a lesbian.

13:09.789 --> 13:11.791
(insects chirping)

13:18.731 --> 13:21.501
(exhales)
Three, two...

13:21.534 --> 13:23.837
-AUDIENCE: Wheel of Fortune!
-(sighs)

13:23.871 --> 13:26.339
Home just in time for Wheel.

13:26.373 --> 13:27.975
Pretty impressive
how I have my commute

13:28.008 --> 13:30.043
timed so perfectly, huh, Jimbo?

13:30.077 --> 13:31.979
(groaning)

13:32.012 --> 13:35.215
Another crazy one at work today.

13:35.248 --> 13:36.850
You know, Debbie,
from accounting?

13:36.884 --> 13:39.953
She ate shit coming
out of the bathroom.

13:39.987 --> 13:42.956
Really fucked herself up.
Super funny.

13:42.990 --> 13:46.026
Also, Mike's cat's butt
exploded.

13:46.059 --> 13:48.561
(Jimmy moaning)

13:48.595 --> 13:52.632
JIMMY: Don't you want
to know what's wrong?

13:52.665 --> 13:54.234
Of course.

13:54.267 --> 13:58.671
I was essentially fired
off my own movie,

13:58.705 --> 14:03.376
only to be rewritten
by Diablo Cody. Diablo Cody.

14:03.410 --> 14:05.578
-Juno.
-I do know.

14:05.612 --> 14:08.815
Ever since, I've been
in a depressive spiral.

14:08.848 --> 14:12.685
I hope that you can
still love me through this.

14:15.522 --> 14:18.491
There, there, bud.

14:18.525 --> 14:19.893
It'll be okay.

14:19.927 --> 14:22.729
You know,
I really underestimated

14:22.762 --> 14:27.567
the amount of psychic pain
that depression can inflict.

14:27.600 --> 14:31.404
This really puts your past
flare-ups into context.

14:31.438 --> 14:35.408
It really does.

14:35.442 --> 14:37.277
(groaning)

14:40.880 --> 14:43.850
* Got a issue, got a issue,
better leave it *

14:43.883 --> 14:45.552
* I don't really say it
unless I mean it *

14:45.585 --> 14:48.121
* Magazines ain't here
for reading *

14:48.155 --> 14:50.523
* 'Cause now these ...
fucking with the meanest *

14:50.557 --> 14:52.892
* Since a youngin', I've been
going fucking hammer *

14:52.926 --> 14:55.695
* Don't believe me?
Ask my motherfucking nana *

14:55.728 --> 14:58.131
* She'll tell you I've been
crazy since pajamas *

14:58.165 --> 15:00.700
* Everybody in my crew
go bananas *

15:00.733 --> 15:03.370
* Burn said kill it,
I said why not? *

15:03.403 --> 15:06.106
* Aim it through the alley,
that's a tight shot *

15:06.139 --> 15:08.441
* Bitch, pussy good,
that's a tight shot *

15:08.475 --> 15:09.876
* Too bad that my heart... *

15:09.909 --> 15:12.612
Hey, Gretchen.

15:12.645 --> 15:14.514
Hello there.

15:15.782 --> 15:17.150
How are you?

15:18.485 --> 15:20.453
So good.

15:20.487 --> 15:23.223
Work is B-A-N-A-N-A-S.

15:23.256 --> 15:27.394
Debbie from accounting died, so
there's a cake for that later.

15:27.427 --> 15:30.397
And my assistant Mike's cat
has a robot butt.

15:30.430 --> 15:33.166
You know, cool work stuff.

15:33.200 --> 15:35.202
Mm-hmm.

15:39.439 --> 15:42.409
All right.

15:42.442 --> 15:44.011
See ya.

15:44.044 --> 15:47.247
JIMMY:
* The bells are ringing *

15:47.280 --> 15:49.616
* For me and my gal *

15:49.649 --> 15:52.352
* The birds are singing *

15:52.385 --> 15:54.921
* For me and my gal *

15:54.954 --> 15:58.325
* Everybody been knowing *

15:58.358 --> 16:01.861
* To a wedding we're goin'. *

16:01.894 --> 16:03.330
(chuckles)

16:03.363 --> 16:05.298
I've done it.
I bested my depression.

16:05.332 --> 16:08.935
Gretchen, I gazed
into the eye of the great void

16:08.968 --> 16:10.537
and I said, "Nay,

16:10.570 --> 16:13.340
you shan't take me today, void."

16:13.373 --> 16:15.642
-(chuckles): Hmm.
-Sorry for being
such a bummer yesterday.

16:15.675 --> 16:17.277
It was really quite
selfish of me

16:17.310 --> 16:20.313
to burden you
with my sadness like that.

16:20.347 --> 16:21.848
-No worries.
-And now I wholly

16:21.881 --> 16:24.551
empathize with your experience
of depression.

16:24.584 --> 16:27.187
I'm just glad those dark days
are behind us.

16:27.220 --> 16:28.955
-Anyways, I really got
to get to...
-I am gonna seize

16:28.988 --> 16:34.227
this glorious day to take care
of manifold wedding tasks.

16:34.261 --> 16:36.063
I can't believe we're getting
married in four days.

16:36.096 --> 16:38.898
-Same. (whoops)
-I'm also gonna take my tux
to get pressed.

16:38.931 --> 16:40.533
Would you like me
to take your dress, as well?

16:40.567 --> 16:42.135
Don't worry, I won't peek at it.

16:42.169 --> 16:44.371
-Actually, I don't have one.
-What's that?

16:44.404 --> 16:46.573
No dress, homeboy.
I've been busy.

16:46.606 --> 16:48.808
Work. Got to go, so busy.

16:48.841 --> 16:51.744
Debbie go boom,
cat butt turn for worse.

16:51.778 --> 16:53.046
Bye.

16:57.517 --> 16:59.319
(door opens, closes)

16:59.352 --> 17:01.688
PHOTOGRAPHER:
Work it.

17:01.721 --> 17:04.491
YVETTE:
Remind the D.A. that while Lil'
Reba claims in every interview

17:04.524 --> 17:07.227
to be "moving bricks,"
she's nine years old.

17:07.260 --> 17:09.262
Then leak to the source
that Reba is quote:

17:09.296 --> 17:11.531
"Hard as shit and has been
flipping packs

17:11.564 --> 17:12.665
since she was six."

17:12.699 --> 17:14.401
Okay? Uh, yes, and...

17:14.434 --> 17:17.204
Let me call you back.

17:17.237 --> 17:19.739
Lindsay, please.
I really don't have

17:19.772 --> 17:23.110
-time for your...
-Ta-da.

17:23.143 --> 17:24.277
Oh, dear God.

17:24.311 --> 17:25.612
I really like you, Yvette.

17:25.645 --> 17:27.046
I want to go hiking to Costco

17:27.080 --> 17:29.382
with you and buy chili stuff.

17:29.416 --> 17:31.284
Let's make a chili.

17:31.318 --> 17:34.254
Did you seriously think
that putting on

17:34.287 --> 17:38.024
some lesbian minstrel show
would convince me to... what?

17:38.057 --> 17:40.960
I don't even know what you want.

17:40.993 --> 17:42.129
(scoffs)

17:42.162 --> 17:44.797
-I want you.
-You're not gay.

17:44.831 --> 17:47.434
Not to mention the fact
that you had an agenda

17:47.467 --> 17:48.968
to get Gretchen hired back.

17:49.001 --> 17:52.139
That's not true! We squished
boxes before you fired Gretchen.

17:52.172 --> 17:53.873
Don't hire her back,
I don't care.

17:53.906 --> 17:55.775
I'm sorry, Lindsay.

17:55.808 --> 17:57.977
Okay, you're right,
maybe I am trying hard

17:58.010 --> 18:00.480
but that's because I love you
so quit the bullshit

18:00.513 --> 18:03.350
and tell me you love me back or
I'll stab you, you fucking cunt.

18:07.954 --> 18:09.389
You know what?

18:09.422 --> 18:10.757
You're fired.

18:10.790 --> 18:12.225
You can't fire me.

18:12.259 --> 18:13.926
There are literal hours
of security footage

18:13.960 --> 18:16.829
of you stealing confidential
documents from the shred bin.

18:16.863 --> 18:19.299
You mean the locked trash?

18:19.332 --> 18:20.767
You also just threatened
to stab me.

18:20.800 --> 18:24.137
-I'm gonna...
-Yeah.

18:28.007 --> 18:30.610
So what am I looking at,
severance package-wise?

18:30.643 --> 18:31.944
Just around?

18:31.978 --> 18:33.546
-Ballpark it for me is fine.
-(scoffs)

18:37.150 --> 18:38.385
(chuckles)

18:42.889 --> 18:44.724
(sighs)

18:45.625 --> 18:46.826
(sighs)

18:48.828 --> 18:50.630
-Yo, you got the papers?
-No, Gretchen.

18:50.663 --> 18:52.098
I don't have your papers.

18:52.131 --> 18:55.868
-I quit.
-What? Why?

18:55.902 --> 18:58.104
For you, in solidarity.
I thought you'd be happy.

18:58.137 --> 19:00.039
Four days, Lindsay.

19:00.072 --> 19:02.609
You couldn't hold on
for four goddamn more days?

19:02.642 --> 19:05.111
No! This has gone too far.

19:05.144 --> 19:08.215
Just tell Jimmy the truth.

19:08.248 --> 19:10.283
If someone really loves you,
they don't get mad,

19:10.317 --> 19:11.551
no matter what you tell them.

19:11.584 --> 19:13.653
Here, watch.

19:13.686 --> 19:16.389
I've been sleeping with Yvette.

19:16.423 --> 19:19.359
And also, I didn't quit.
She fired me.

19:19.392 --> 19:20.960
See?

19:20.993 --> 19:23.496
And I ate her butt.
See? No one cares.

19:23.530 --> 19:26.032
Yvette? You were literally
sleeping with the enemy!

19:26.065 --> 19:27.634
You're not gay.

19:27.667 --> 19:30.136
Well, I thought maybe I was
for a second because I'm lost.

19:30.169 --> 19:32.004
Jesus.

19:32.038 --> 19:34.741
Changed my mind,
maybe you shouldn't tell Jimmy.

19:34.774 --> 19:36.743
Also, she wasn't the enemy.

19:36.776 --> 19:39.979
You actually did
screw up pretty bad.

19:40.012 --> 19:42.882
You caused, like, a hundred
grand worth of water damage

19:42.915 --> 19:44.684
-to that club.
-You sound like a narc.

19:44.717 --> 19:46.986
You're a giant narc bitch
and I have somewhere to be.

19:47.019 --> 19:49.422
-Narc.
-Well, you're a tiny bitch.

19:49.456 --> 19:51.157
And I have nowhere to be.

19:51.190 --> 19:53.826
And you didn't even say
anything about my hair.

19:53.860 --> 19:54.961
It's Paul hair.

19:56.028 --> 19:58.331
What are you doing later?

19:58.365 --> 20:00.267
I don't know! Call me!

20:06.138 --> 20:08.140
(dogs barking, yapping)

20:17.116 --> 20:19.018
EDGAR:
Oh, hi.

20:19.051 --> 20:20.953
Um, my friend's a klepto and
I think she just stole a dog.

20:20.987 --> 20:23.256
What? Uh... No.

20:23.290 --> 20:25.892
(scoffs) These doggos
are all up for adoption

20:25.925 --> 20:27.894
or walking.
We're here every week.

20:27.927 --> 20:31.130
You know, most people
do this for the dogs,

20:31.163 --> 20:32.632
but something tells me
that chick needs

20:32.665 --> 20:34.534
these walks
more than the dogs do.

20:34.567 --> 20:36.869
Some of the dogs actually get
bummed when she shows up.

20:36.903 --> 20:38.438
Like they can smell
the desperation.

20:38.471 --> 20:39.806
Just give me a dog, man.

20:41.140 --> 20:44.811
Make it a real badass one.

20:44.844 --> 20:46.846
(dog grunting)

20:49.782 --> 20:52.419
(dog barking in distance)

20:55.488 --> 20:57.990
You following me, narc?

20:58.024 --> 21:00.059
I'm worried about you, Gretchen.

21:00.092 --> 21:02.595
Why? I'm doing great.

21:02.629 --> 21:04.130
Look how good I am at fetch.

21:06.466 --> 21:08.234
(dog panting)

21:08.267 --> 21:10.102
What were you looking for
in the garbage this morning?

21:10.136 --> 21:12.439
-Mind your own business, Edgar.
-You made it my business

21:12.472 --> 21:14.006
when you started
stealing my meds.

21:14.040 --> 21:15.642
-Meds you don't use.
-I don't use them

21:15.675 --> 21:18.811
because they were messing me
up and they're prescribed to me.

21:18.845 --> 21:20.112
Who knows what
they're doing to you.

21:20.146 --> 21:21.648
I do.

21:21.681 --> 21:23.416
They're making life bearable.

21:23.450 --> 21:26.619
Are you insane, monitoring me?

21:26.653 --> 21:29.789
My parents did that
and they were my parents.

21:29.822 --> 21:31.824
And I rejected them
forever for it.

21:31.858 --> 21:34.661
You're just... you.

21:34.694 --> 21:36.963
Like, who the fuck
are you, even?

21:36.996 --> 21:41.634
Maybe the best thing
for everyone

21:41.668 --> 21:43.470
would be for you

21:43.503 --> 21:46.839
to get the hell out
of our lives for good!

21:46.873 --> 21:48.841
I know you got fired.

21:52.178 --> 21:53.513
Please don't tell Jimmy.

21:53.546 --> 21:55.648
Jimmy doesn't care
about your job.

21:55.682 --> 21:57.950
Edgar, I am begging you.

21:57.984 --> 21:59.652
Don't tell Jimmy.

21:59.686 --> 22:03.055
He will leave me again
and this time, he won't be

22:03.089 --> 22:04.891
-wrong to do it.
-Gretchen, Jesus.

22:04.924 --> 22:07.527
I was really trying at work.

22:09.562 --> 22:12.999
And I still blew it.

22:13.032 --> 22:15.902
Even when I try, I fail.

22:15.935 --> 22:19.171
I always fail.

22:19.205 --> 22:21.007
And I can't fail with Jimmy.

22:21.040 --> 22:23.610
I just... can't.

22:24.911 --> 22:27.647
I won't tell him.

22:27.680 --> 22:30.617
But don't you think
you should be able to?

22:35.287 --> 22:37.624
(softly):
I'm sorry.

22:45.131 --> 22:49.836
-(lock clicks)
-* I saw you *

22:49.869 --> 22:51.404
* Standing there... *

22:51.438 --> 22:55.274
Goddamn, homey, work was
straight cray again today.

22:55.307 --> 22:58.077
But I am so stoked I made it
home in time for...

22:58.110 --> 23:01.414
(muffled):
What's up, Jimmy?

23:01.448 --> 23:04.116
(chuckling):
Jimmy.

23:04.150 --> 23:05.685
(voice quavers):
What?

23:05.718 --> 23:10.457
* I wonder why, oh why *

23:10.490 --> 23:13.059
* Ooh *

23:13.092 --> 23:17.797
* That you were not there *

23:17.830 --> 23:21.233
* Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh *

23:21.267 --> 23:24.604
* You looked so good *

23:24.637 --> 23:26.272
I got you a wedding dress.

23:26.305 --> 23:27.740
(snaps fingers)

23:27.774 --> 23:30.577
* Ooh *

23:30.610 --> 23:35.314
* That I stopped
and I stared... *

23:35.347 --> 23:36.949
What the...

23:36.983 --> 23:39.786
Jimmy, that's exactly the dress
I didn't know I needed.

23:39.819 --> 23:41.053
How did you...?

23:41.087 --> 23:43.222
* Why... *

23:43.255 --> 23:44.791
Beat it.

23:47.794 --> 23:49.729
-Can you unzip me, mister?
-(quietly): Yes, just go.

23:49.762 --> 23:52.799
* That day... *

23:52.832 --> 23:56.402
JIMMY: Obviously we'll have it
taken in significantly.

23:56.435 --> 23:58.605
Thank you.

23:58.638 --> 24:00.072
* I looked for you... *

24:00.106 --> 24:02.408
I got fired.

24:02.441 --> 24:05.478
Oh. Well, that's okay.

24:05.512 --> 24:07.179
Really?

24:07.213 --> 24:09.281
Yeah, we'll figure it out.

24:09.315 --> 24:12.451
And if not, Edgar can give us
homeless advice.

24:12.485 --> 24:14.286
(both chuckle)

24:14.320 --> 24:16.689
Actually, I got fired,
like, two weeks ago.

24:16.723 --> 24:18.457
I've just been pretending
to go to work

24:18.491 --> 24:21.327
like some prideful
Japanese businessman.

24:21.360 --> 24:23.429
Also I stopped talking
to my therapist

24:23.462 --> 24:25.532
and I've been taking
a bunch of random pills.

24:25.565 --> 24:28.668
And even though
I have literally nothing to do,

24:28.701 --> 24:30.436
I just can't bear
to bring myself

24:30.469 --> 24:32.572
to do a single thing
for this wedding.

24:34.574 --> 24:37.309
Our wedding is gonna be amazing.

24:38.377 --> 24:42.214
* Ooh *

24:42.248 --> 24:44.584
* You may not be deep *

24:46.586 --> 24:50.823
* Ah... ah *

24:50.857 --> 24:54.360
* This could happen to you,
pretty baby *

24:54.393 --> 24:57.530
* Ooh, ooh *

24:57.564 --> 25:02.301
* Like it happened to me *

25:02.334 --> 25:06.172
* Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh. *

25:13.746 --> 25:16.716

She was clawing

I was hypnotized.
