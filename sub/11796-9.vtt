00:04.037 --> 00:07.273

00:07.307 --> 00:10.143

00:10.176 --> 00:13.046

00:16.583 --> 00:22.255

00:22.288 --> 00:25.425

<i>* It's all right</i>

01:14.941 --> 01:17.944
   This week we
   have a big project
   due in photography class.

01:17.977 --> 01:19.979
I still haven't decided
on my subject,

01:20.080 --> 01:22.682
  but I have a feeling
  any
  great-looking girl will do.

01:26.186 --> 01:29.089
 You know, Slater,
 through this
 lens your nose hairs

01:29.089 --> 01:32.092
look like
the Amazon rainforest.

01:32.092 --> 01:34.427
  If you don't get
  that camera out of my face,

01:34.461 --> 01:36.363
 I'm gonna have the natives
 come out and eat you.

01:36.396 --> 01:37.697
Yikes!

01:38.832 --> 01:40.767
 What's your photo project,
 Slater?

01:42.369 --> 01:46.539
 I was in my yard
 and I saw these
 beautiful butterflies

01:46.573 --> 01:49.976
 and they were fluttering over
 these delicate white roses...

01:50.010 --> 01:52.112
 ( laughing )

01:52.112 --> 01:54.114
 What are you gonna do,
 macho man?

01:54.147 --> 01:57.684
  I don't know yet,
  I'm still waiting
  for the right inspiration.

02:00.954 --> 02:04.591
  Hello, inspiration!

02:04.624 --> 02:07.060
   - Screech,
   give me your camera.
   - Why?

02:07.060 --> 02:08.428
 Zack?

02:09.429 --> 02:12.165
  ( camera clicking )

02:12.198 --> 02:15.368
  - Should I say cheese?
  - Bet you can't say
  it without a smile.

02:15.402 --> 02:17.837
  - Hi, I'm Zack Morris.
  - Hi, I'm Danielle Gordon.

02:17.871 --> 02:20.073
   I see you're wearing
   a USC sweatshirt.

02:20.073 --> 02:23.076
  - Are you a fellow Trojan?
  - I just started. You, too?

02:23.076 --> 02:27.647
   Oh, very perceptive.
   I'm...
   A photojournalism major.

02:27.681 --> 02:29.282
 Oh, here's a picture for you,

02:29.315 --> 02:34.220
 "Stranded motorist
 desperately needs a phone..."

02:34.254 --> 02:37.557
   Pardon me.
   Whoa, whoa, whoa.

02:39.726 --> 02:41.094
Here, use mine.

02:41.127 --> 02:44.097
 - Thank you.
 - No problem.

02:44.097 --> 02:47.400
  Man, he's good, she's only
  been here for two minutes.

02:48.368 --> 02:50.170
   An hour?

02:50.203 --> 02:52.739
It's just a flat tire.

02:52.772 --> 02:55.175
Excuse me, let me talk.

02:55.208 --> 02:57.677
Thanks, but no thanks.

02:57.711 --> 03:01.514
  - I can change
  your tire for you.
  - You are so sweet.

03:01.548 --> 03:03.116
  So sweet I could kiss you.

03:03.149 --> 03:05.218
  We'll discuss my fee later.

03:14.227 --> 03:16.262
   ( Zack chuckles )

03:16.296 --> 03:19.065
   Hey, what happened, Preppie?
   She dump you?

03:19.099 --> 03:21.134
Guess again,
my high school friend.

03:21.167 --> 03:23.603
   Danielle, my college honey,
   just asked me to meet her

03:23.636 --> 03:25.905
 - tomorrow night at The Attic.
 - The Attic?

03:25.939 --> 03:29.709
 Wow, that sounds like fun.
 There could be bats up there.

03:30.710 --> 03:32.512
 You're bats, Screech.

03:32.545 --> 03:36.416
  The Attic is
  an over-18 dance club
  and Zack's only 16.

03:36.449 --> 03:39.119
 That may be
 true today, Slater,
 but by tomorrow night

03:39.152 --> 03:41.821
   - we'll all be 18.
   - Oh, no.

03:41.855 --> 03:44.758
  Mom said I have
  to move out at 18.

03:46.292 --> 03:49.329
 - I gotta go look for a place.
 - Wait, no, Screech.

03:57.570 --> 04:00.340
- Good morning, class.
- All: Morning, Mr. B.

04:00.373 --> 04:02.909
  Now that you've all taken
  a lot of pictures,

04:02.942 --> 04:05.245
let's see what's developed.
( laughs )

04:07.180 --> 04:09.182
   Oh, hey!

04:09.215 --> 04:12.218
- Nice picture, Kelly.
- Thanks, Mr. Belding.

04:12.252 --> 04:14.821
 Jeff's easy to photograph,
 the camera loves him.

04:14.854 --> 04:17.322
 The camera's not
 the only thing that loves him.

04:19.291 --> 04:21.394
 Is that the guy
 she dumped Zack for?

04:21.428 --> 04:24.497
   That's old gossip, sir,
   try and keep up.

04:24.531 --> 04:25.932
 Screech, would you hurry up?

04:25.965 --> 04:28.535
  If Belding catches us
  making fake IDs we're dead.

04:30.170 --> 04:33.373
   <i>- Finito.</i>
    - Hey, excellent.

04:33.406 --> 04:37.310
   You idiot, no one's
   gonna believe
   I'm 54 years old.

04:39.446 --> 04:42.349
 Check it out, guys, my folks
 will be going to sleep soon.

04:42.382 --> 04:45.218
  So when my mom
  says good night,
  we're out of here.

04:45.251 --> 04:46.853
- All: Out of here!
- ( knocking on door )

04:46.886 --> 04:48.588
- We're gone.
- Shh!

04:48.621 --> 04:50.824
   Come in.

04:50.857 --> 04:53.827
 Hi, guys.
 I brought you a bedtime snack.

04:53.860 --> 04:55.428
  - Oh, food.
  - Brownies.

04:55.462 --> 04:57.731
 Mom, come on,
 we're not little kids anymore.

04:57.764 --> 05:00.033
 And we got the IDs to prove...

05:01.034 --> 05:03.069
 These are great, Mom, thanks.

05:03.103 --> 05:05.739
- Aren't they, Screech?
- ( mumbles )

05:05.772 --> 05:08.808
 Anything for my boys.

05:10.944 --> 05:13.580
  It's been so long since
  Zack has had a sleep-over.

05:13.613 --> 05:17.050
  - What is she doing?
  - Mom, what are you doing?

05:17.050 --> 05:19.119
  Checking for girls,
  what else?

05:19.152 --> 05:20.387
 Mom, come on, relax.

05:20.420 --> 05:22.222
   Relax?
   I'm your mother.

05:22.255 --> 05:24.791
  I know you
  too well to relax.

05:24.824 --> 05:26.292
Don't stay up too late.

05:26.326 --> 05:29.162
   Don't worry about that, Mom,
   we're real tired.

05:31.431 --> 05:34.200
  Oh, yeah, we probably
  won't stay up much longer.

05:34.234 --> 05:36.169
 Okay.

05:36.202 --> 05:38.104
   Good night, guys.

05:38.138 --> 05:40.473
Goodnight, Mom.

05:42.976 --> 05:45.512
Gentlemen, let's do it.

05:51.551 --> 05:53.086
 Okay!

05:53.086 --> 05:55.088
 Let's party!

05:55.088 --> 05:57.090
( dance music playing )

06:02.262 --> 06:04.597
Zack, I'm scared.
What if we get caught?

06:04.631 --> 06:07.467
   They're not gonna catch us.
   Just shut up and act old.

06:07.500 --> 06:10.904
This guy couldn't spot
a fake ID if we nailed it
to his forehead.

06:10.937 --> 06:14.474
   What are you trying to pull?
   This ID is fake, man.

06:14.507 --> 06:18.278
 I can spot these
 things a mile away,
 now get out of here.

06:20.080 --> 06:22.048
   Can you believe that guy
   with a fake ID?

06:22.082 --> 06:25.218
  Some guys just can't wait
  to grow up.

06:25.251 --> 06:27.620
   All right, thanks a lot.

06:29.089 --> 06:31.925
 Hey, cool scar, man.

06:31.958 --> 06:34.828
   Thanks, man,
   it's a gift from my girl.

06:37.597 --> 06:40.600
 Why do they call you bouncers?
 You don't
 really bounce people?

06:40.633 --> 06:43.536
- Sometimes.
- It's all right, Joey,

06:43.570 --> 06:46.706
 - this hunk's with me.
 - I am?

06:46.740 --> 06:48.508
He is?

06:48.541 --> 06:50.944
   - Why didn't you
   say so, Reggie?
   - But I'm not...

06:50.977 --> 06:52.812
Come on, go on in,
it's all right.

06:52.846 --> 06:55.248
   Guys, help! Guys!

06:59.486 --> 07:03.256
   Both: Hey, Babe!

07:03.289 --> 07:05.025
  - Yes.
  - All right, Zack!

07:05.025 --> 07:08.361
  - It's good to be 18.
  - Even Screech got a babe.

07:09.362 --> 07:11.064
 Guys, cut in.

07:11.097 --> 07:13.667
 ( screams )
 Guys!

07:13.700 --> 07:15.835
 - Excuse me. Hi.
 - Hi.

07:15.869 --> 07:17.871
- I'm glad you came.
- I'm glad you're glad.

07:17.904 --> 07:19.406
  - If he's glad, I'm glad.
  - Great. Come on,

07:19.439 --> 07:21.741
 I want you
 to meet some friends.

07:21.775 --> 07:24.511
 Joan, Sandy, this is Zack,
 the guy who changed my tire.

07:24.544 --> 07:27.380
  It was nothing, really.
  I rescue beautiful
  women all the time.

07:27.414 --> 07:29.249
 We never did discuss your fee.

07:29.282 --> 07:30.817
   I really don't...

07:31.718 --> 07:34.888
  ( Slater clearing throat )

07:34.921 --> 07:37.357
  Oh, oh... Um... This is...

07:37.390 --> 07:39.459
 Hi, I'm Zack's older, cooler,

07:39.492 --> 07:41.428
 more-happening friend,
 AC Slater.

07:41.461 --> 07:43.830
   What's the AC stand for?

07:43.863 --> 07:45.632
  Absolutely charmed.

07:47.100 --> 07:50.437
  How come I've never seen
  you girls on campus before?

07:50.470 --> 07:52.439
   Save me, please.

07:53.073 --> 07:54.908
  Excuse me.

07:56.376 --> 07:58.378
 Why are you acting
 like a dweeb?

07:58.411 --> 08:01.481
   If Reggie comes
   looking for Don,
   you haven't seen me. Shh!

08:02.315 --> 08:04.384
  Who's that?

08:04.417 --> 08:07.053
   That's our friend Don,
   he's kind of shy.

08:07.087 --> 08:10.090
 - Would you like to dance?
 - As soon as Donny
 lets go of my shoe.

08:10.123 --> 08:12.492
 Right.
 Excuse me, I'm sorry.

08:12.525 --> 08:14.794
   I am terribly sorry.
   Sorry.

08:14.828 --> 08:17.263
Come on, why don't
you guys dance with us?

08:17.297 --> 08:19.065
  Look, Joan,

08:19.099 --> 08:21.768
  I've got a girlfriend
  and I really don't
  know if I should...

08:21.801 --> 08:24.771
 Hey, I just want to dance,
 not get married.

08:24.804 --> 08:27.640
  I can live with that.
  Let's go.

08:27.674 --> 08:30.610
 Hey, fox, is this your Dorito?

08:31.611 --> 08:33.679
  Great, more for me.

08:33.712 --> 08:37.317
  Donny! I've been looking
  everywhere for you.

08:37.350 --> 08:38.818
Yikes!

08:41.688 --> 08:45.792
 Look, here's Jessie
 and me at Disneyland.

08:45.825 --> 08:48.695
  Those aren't her real ears.

08:48.728 --> 08:51.331
 You know what?
 Jessie would love this place.

08:51.364 --> 08:53.633
  - Did I tell you
  she's a great dancer?
  - I know.

08:53.667 --> 08:56.903
 You showed us her kindergarten
 tap dance picture.

08:56.936 --> 08:58.238
  Oh.

08:58.271 --> 08:59.806
 Is everybody having
 a great time?

08:59.839 --> 09:01.908
   Danielle, we gotta split.

09:02.008 --> 09:03.677
  - Now.
  - Oh, wow!

09:03.710 --> 09:06.312
  - I can't believe
  it's 2:00 already.
  - Are you serious?

09:06.346 --> 09:08.748
 I felt like we just got here.

09:08.782 --> 09:11.785
   I had a great time Zack.
   Maybe we can
   meet tomorrow for lunch?

09:12.552 --> 09:14.521
Gee, Danielle, I can't.

09:14.554 --> 09:17.223
   I'll be in
   the darkroom all day
   working on a big project.

09:17.257 --> 09:19.826
- Okay, call me?
- Sure.

09:22.862 --> 09:25.498
Don't call me.

09:25.532 --> 09:27.634
  Smooth as always,
  eh, Slater?

09:27.667 --> 09:29.836
Ha ha. Shut up.

09:32.072 --> 09:34.040
   ( bouncer clears throat )

09:37.243 --> 09:39.713
Donny fell asleep
while we were dancing.

09:39.746 --> 09:41.581
   Give him my number, okay?

09:41.614 --> 09:43.650
I don't have a hand...

09:45.251 --> 09:47.454
 - Hey, I'm beat.
 - Both: Let's get out of here.

09:47.487 --> 09:49.322
Hey, wait, wait, wait.

09:49.356 --> 09:51.858
  Isn't that Jeff
  over there dancing?

09:53.626 --> 09:56.429
  - Yeah, but that's not Kelly.
  - Where's not Kelly?

09:59.866 --> 10:02.035
 Whoa!

10:08.575 --> 10:10.643
   Good morning, guys.
   How was your sleep-over?

10:10.677 --> 10:13.913
  Did you wear your jammies
  with the little
  footsie-wootsies?

10:15.181 --> 10:17.717
 Don't start with me, Mama,
 it's too early.

10:20.286 --> 10:22.622
   Good morning, everybody.

10:27.327 --> 10:29.162
 Are you gonna tell her
 about Jeff?

10:29.195 --> 10:31.197
   I'm too tired to
   think right now.

10:31.231 --> 10:33.166
 - ( bell rings )
 - (screams )

10:34.968 --> 10:38.038
 Morning, everybody. Before we
 take a look at your projects,

10:38.071 --> 10:40.306
  I wanna show you
  what
  an experienced photographer

10:40.340 --> 10:42.976
can do with a camera.
Lights please.

10:47.280 --> 10:49.215
   These are slides
   of Mrs. B and me

10:49.249 --> 10:52.318
 on our trip to our wild,
 exotic neighbor to the south,

10:52.352 --> 10:54.020
  San Diego.

10:55.522 --> 10:58.158
 I can barely contain myself.

11:00.360 --> 11:02.595
  This is Mrs. B at SeaWorld.

11:02.629 --> 11:05.065
  Why is she eating raw fish?

11:06.199 --> 11:09.903
That is not Mrs. B,
that's Shamu...

11:11.571 --> 11:13.606
  The whale.

11:14.774 --> 11:17.077
 Notice the use
 of shadow and light.

11:17.077 --> 11:19.079
  ( snoring )

11:21.214 --> 11:25.185
 I said, notice the use
 of shadow and light!

11:25.218 --> 11:28.855
Oh yeah, yes, yes.
Shamu has an overbite.

11:28.888 --> 11:30.990
 She's a whale of a woman, sir,
 a whale.

11:31.091 --> 11:33.426
  All right, all right,
  I can take a hint.

11:36.629 --> 11:38.865
   Kelly, let's take a look
   at your project.

11:38.898 --> 11:42.102
I call my project,
"Portraits of My Guy."

11:42.102 --> 11:45.138
   Oh, it's very good use...

11:45.171 --> 11:46.840
   Of natural light!

11:48.808 --> 11:50.977
 Well, Jeff looks good
 in any light.

11:51.011 --> 11:53.513
 You should see him
 under a disco light.

11:57.150 --> 11:59.486
What happened?
You guys look terrible.

11:59.519 --> 12:01.855
 Leave us alone,
 we were dancing at The Attic

12:01.888 --> 12:04.524
- till 3:00 in the morning.
- Screech.

12:04.557 --> 12:07.060
   You went dancing
   at The Attic without me?

12:07.060 --> 12:09.362
Well, kind of,

12:09.396 --> 12:11.297
but I did it for Zack.

12:11.331 --> 12:14.567
   Relax,
   Jessie, all he did all night
   was talk about you.

12:14.601 --> 12:17.537
   - I missed you, Mama.
   - You missed me?

12:17.570 --> 12:19.539
   - Uh-huh.
   - Oo-ooh.

12:21.775 --> 12:25.111
Wait a minute, you have
to be 18 to get
into The Attic.

12:25.145 --> 12:27.981
   Not true,
   you could be 54.

12:29.482 --> 12:31.951
 Or have one of these.

12:31.985 --> 12:34.120
Fake IDs! That's wrong.

12:34.154 --> 12:35.889
   That's immoral,
   that's dishonest,

12:35.922 --> 12:38.491
 - that's...
 - Cool, I want one of those.

12:38.525 --> 12:40.226
 Everybody goes to The Attic.

12:40.260 --> 12:44.230
  Even that sleazy,
  slimy, smiley Jeff.

12:44.264 --> 12:45.565
 Kelly's Jeff?

12:45.598 --> 12:47.300
  You mean he was
  with another girl?

12:47.334 --> 12:50.303
   - Bingo.
   - That slimeball.

12:50.337 --> 12:52.739
  That's terr...
  Someone's gotta tell Kelly.

12:52.772 --> 12:55.408
Yeah, but who's
gonna tell her?

12:56.276 --> 12:58.678
   Don't look at me.

12:58.712 --> 13:01.815
   Believe me, Zack,
   she'll thank you.

13:01.848 --> 13:04.117
 You maggot-mouthed liar,
 you're just jealous.

13:04.150 --> 13:07.087
 - Jeff would
 never cheat on me.
 - I saw it with my own eyes.

13:07.120 --> 13:10.156
  You're wrong, last night Jeff
  went bowling
  with his roommates.

13:10.190 --> 13:13.426
Why don't you mind your own
business and
stay out of my life?

13:17.163 --> 13:21.935
- What's going on out here?
- Nothing,
just a rude customer.

13:21.968 --> 13:25.138
   Jeff, where are we going
   Saturday night?

13:25.171 --> 13:28.641
 Oh... Uh... Saturday.

13:28.675 --> 13:31.077
   Sorry,
   I have to work till 11:30

13:31.077 --> 13:33.113
  and you gotta be home
  by midnight, right?

13:33.146 --> 13:35.749
   Maybe I can ask my mom
   for an extension.

13:35.782 --> 13:38.284
  No, no, no,
  we'll go out next Saturday.

13:38.318 --> 13:40.353
We'll spend
the whole day together.

13:40.387 --> 13:42.255
But I have to work
next Saturday.

13:42.288 --> 13:45.125
  Hey, I'm your boss,
  I'll give you the day off.

13:45.158 --> 13:47.093
We'll have fun.

13:47.093 --> 13:49.162
 Okay. Great.

13:51.164 --> 13:53.366
 Yeah, great.

13:57.570 --> 13:59.439
 Yeah, I love USC too.

13:59.472 --> 14:01.574
 College life is great,
 isn't it?

14:01.608 --> 14:05.245
 Yeah, funny,
 but I never see you on campus.

14:05.278 --> 14:07.747
See, when you're
a photojournalism major

14:07.781 --> 14:09.916
 you've gotta be out
 snapping life as it happens.

14:09.949 --> 14:11.651
What's happening
this weekend?

14:11.685 --> 14:13.653
You're what's
happening, baby.

14:13.687 --> 14:16.356
  - I'll see you
  Saturday at The Attic.
  - Okay, you've got a date.

14:16.389 --> 14:18.158
   - All right, see ya.
   - Bye.

14:19.726 --> 14:22.862
- I love college.
- ( knocking )

14:22.896 --> 14:24.230
   Come in.

14:24.264 --> 14:26.700
   Honey, I have great news.

14:26.733 --> 14:29.235
 Peter, Paul and Mary
 are in town.

14:29.269 --> 14:31.304
 Oh, are they
 Uncle Lester's kids?

14:32.939 --> 14:36.676
 No, they are my favorite
 singing group from the '60s.

14:36.710 --> 14:39.446
  Your father and I are gonna
  see them on Saturday night.

14:39.479 --> 14:41.448
  Would you like to join us?

14:41.481 --> 14:44.351
   Gee, Mom, I'd love to,
   but I told Slater

14:44.384 --> 14:47.120
   I'd stay over
   at his house on Saturday

14:47.153 --> 14:49.356
   and it would break his heart
   if I didn't come.

14:49.389 --> 14:52.092
- But bring me
back a souvenir?
- Okay.

14:52.092 --> 14:54.794
   - You have fun Saturday.
   - I'll try.

14:57.263 --> 14:58.965
   You sure you guys want
   to go through with this?

14:58.998 --> 15:00.800
  Yep, and if Kelly
  doesn't believe you

15:00.834 --> 15:03.036
 maybe she'll believe us
 when we catch Jeff in the act.

15:03.069 --> 15:07.607
 And when we catch that dog
 we're gonna dance
 all over his face.

15:07.640 --> 15:09.809
   What if he's not
   there this time?

15:09.843 --> 15:12.645
 Then we'll just have to force
 ourselves to have a good time.

15:12.679 --> 15:14.314
   I hear there are
   great-looking guys there.

15:14.347 --> 15:17.350
Yeah, especially since
I've been going there.

15:19.619 --> 15:21.154
   Spare me.

15:21.187 --> 15:23.456
   Hey, Screech, just make sure
   you finish the IDs

15:23.490 --> 15:26.059
  for Jessie and Lisa,
  all right?

15:26.059 --> 15:28.194
  - See you later.
  - See ya, Screech.

15:28.228 --> 15:30.563
  "Hey, Screech, just make sure
  you finish IDs

15:30.597 --> 15:32.532
 for Jessie and Lisa."

15:32.565 --> 15:34.634
   Screech, do this,
   Screech, do that.

15:34.668 --> 15:37.070
They'll be sorry
when I'm gone.

15:40.073 --> 15:41.675
   - Hi, Screech.
   - Kelly?!

15:42.575 --> 15:45.178
  Kelly... Uh... Hi.

15:45.211 --> 15:47.514
   Screech,
   can I ask you something?

15:47.547 --> 15:49.849
Well... Not now, Kelly,

15:49.883 --> 15:52.652
 I'm busy making fake IDs
 for Jessie and Lisa.

15:53.887 --> 15:55.822
   Why are you
   making them IDs?

15:55.855 --> 15:58.825
 Because we're going back
 to The Attic tomorrow night.

15:58.858 --> 16:01.127
   Don't ask me why.

16:01.161 --> 16:03.463
You were there
with Zack, huh?

16:03.496 --> 16:05.065
 ( high-pitched voice )
 Yes.

16:07.033 --> 16:10.337
Screech,
did you see Jeff there?

16:10.370 --> 16:12.339
 Um...

16:13.206 --> 16:14.874
 Um...

16:15.809 --> 16:18.178
( crying )
Um-mm.

16:19.679 --> 16:22.048
Then it's true?
But why? I mean why...

16:22.048 --> 16:25.051
  - Why would Jeff cheat on me?
  - I don't know, Kelly.

16:25.085 --> 16:27.053
  Men are such fools.

16:28.355 --> 16:30.156
  I hope I never become one.

16:32.058 --> 16:34.060
Where is Danielle?
She said she'd be here.

16:34.060 --> 16:36.763
You don't think
she stood me up?
I'm pretty cute, right?

16:36.796 --> 16:40.166
 - Is my hair okay? Is th...
 - Yeah, yeah, you look fine.

16:40.200 --> 16:43.636
Listen, don't take this
personally, but there are
a lot of guys here

16:43.670 --> 16:46.072
 and I don't want them to think
 that you and I are together.

16:46.072 --> 16:47.374
 Yeah, right.

16:49.676 --> 16:51.244
  Is this far enough?

16:51.277 --> 16:53.646
- For now.
- Okay.

16:53.680 --> 16:55.215
   Slater, help me.

16:55.248 --> 16:57.650
Reggie's back
and she's still
hot for my bod.

16:57.684 --> 16:59.252
Donny!

16:59.285 --> 17:01.888
 Oh, just my luck,
 she likes hairy guys.

17:05.325 --> 17:07.260
Yeah! Go, Don!

17:07.292 --> 17:09.194
 Don!

17:09.229 --> 17:11.131
  Go, Don, go, Don...

17:11.164 --> 17:15.101
<i>( singing )</i>
<i>* Puff the magic</i>
<i>dragon lived by the sea</i>

17:15.135 --> 17:19.873
  <i>* And frolicked</i>

17:19.906 --> 17:22.041
  ( humming )

17:22.041 --> 17:23.476
   He'll like this.

17:23.510 --> 17:25.444
( humming,
phone ringing )

17:29.149 --> 17:31.051
   Hello, Zack Morris' room.

17:31.051 --> 17:33.653
 Zack isn't in right now,
 may I take a message?

17:33.687 --> 17:35.321
Uh-huh.

17:35.355 --> 17:38.958
"Danielle,
running a little late.

17:39.559 --> 17:41.961
Will meet you at 11:00

17:42.062 --> 17:43.430
at The Attic."

17:44.197 --> 17:45.865
   What's The Attic?

17:47.067 --> 17:48.501
  Oh!

17:48.535 --> 17:51.271
   The dance club
   he met you at last week.

17:51.304 --> 17:54.841
Don't you worry,
he'll get it all right.

17:57.877 --> 18:00.380
  Sleeping at Slater's, huh?

18:03.516 --> 18:06.119
   Hey,
   is that Danielle over there?
   I think I see her.

18:07.821 --> 18:10.256
  Naw, that wasn't her, man.

18:13.159 --> 18:16.563
 Zack!
 You're getting on my nerves.

18:22.769 --> 18:25.705
  - You guys,
  you guys, you guys...
  - Hey, Lisa, wait a second.

18:25.739 --> 18:28.775
  - What's going on?
  - That's going on.

18:28.808 --> 18:33.079
 Check it out, Jeff the jerk.

18:33.113 --> 18:35.915
  Look at the bright side,
  at least he's
  with the same girl.

18:35.949 --> 18:39.252
   That creep. All right,
   everybody just calm down.

18:39.285 --> 18:41.454
Lisa, you take the picture,
then, Slater,

18:41.488 --> 18:43.456
  you hit him while
  he's blinded by the flash.

18:43.490 --> 18:44.958
 - With pleasure, Mama.
 - Hi, guys.

18:45.058 --> 18:47.861
  - Kelly.
  - What are you doing here?

18:47.894 --> 18:50.764
   - Don't you have a curfew?
   - Besides,
   this place bites, Kelly.

18:50.797 --> 18:52.766
- We were just leaving.
- Come on.

18:52.799 --> 18:54.734
  I thought this was
  the happening place to be.

18:54.768 --> 18:56.670
 Everybody comes here.

18:56.703 --> 18:59.439
 Yes, Kelly, unfortunately
 everybody comes here.

19:02.342 --> 19:04.744
 - Kelly,
 let's get out of here.
 - No.

19:04.778 --> 19:07.614
   Thanks, guys,
   but I have to deal
   with this myself.

19:13.453 --> 19:15.455
   Hi, can I cut in?

19:15.488 --> 19:16.756
Kelly!

19:17.424 --> 19:19.125
  Hi.

19:19.159 --> 19:20.727
   Excuse us, Janet.

19:20.760 --> 19:22.328
Kelly, what are
you doing here?

19:22.362 --> 19:25.131
 I'd ask you the same thing,
 but I already know the answer.

19:25.165 --> 19:27.367
  Why, Jeff?

19:27.400 --> 19:31.204
   It's not like we're
   going steady or anything.

19:31.237 --> 19:35.208
  - I mean, I like you a lot...
  - I broke up with
  a great guy for you.

19:35.241 --> 19:37.043
  You're very special to me,

19:37.077 --> 19:39.879
  but I'm just not ready
  for a commitment right now.

19:41.715 --> 19:43.149
  I'm sorry.

19:43.183 --> 19:47.053
I'm sorry I fell
for a dishonest
jerk like you, goodbye.

19:55.228 --> 19:56.763
   You okay?

19:57.597 --> 19:59.632
 You were right, Zack.

19:59.666 --> 20:03.103
  I guess I should erase all
  those bad things I wrote
  about you in my diary.

20:04.170 --> 20:05.672
That'd be nice.

20:05.705 --> 20:08.008
  Thanks for being
  such a good friend.

20:08.041 --> 20:09.876
  We're sorry, Kelly.

20:09.909 --> 20:14.481
  I'll be okay after
  a few minutes of screaming
  in the ladies' room.

20:14.514 --> 20:17.083
 - Come on.
 - Knock yourself out.

20:22.022 --> 20:24.491
 What happened
 to your big bad babe?

20:24.524 --> 20:29.362
 Some guy tried to pick a fight
 with me. She's out back
 taking care of him.

20:29.396 --> 20:32.599
  At least you have a date,
  Screech.
  I got stood up.

20:32.632 --> 20:36.102
   Don't worry, honey,
   Danielle will
   be here at 11:00.

20:36.136 --> 20:37.671
  Yeah, thanks, Mom.

20:37.704 --> 20:39.205
- Mom!
- Mrs. Morris!

20:39.239 --> 20:41.074
Mom, Mom, Mom,
I can explain.

20:41.107 --> 20:44.077
  Good, good, you can start
  by telling me how
  you got in here.

20:44.110 --> 20:47.514
Piece of cake, all you need
is one of these
little beauties.

20:47.547 --> 20:51.084
 That's nice, Screech.
 I'll take those,
 thank you very much.

20:51.117 --> 20:54.154
Now let's go, boys.
You are in big trouble.

20:54.187 --> 20:55.689
Great.

20:55.722 --> 20:57.590
Mom, I... Look... I...

20:57.624 --> 21:00.260
  Zack, Hi.
  Did you get my message?
  I'm sorry I'm late.

21:00.293 --> 21:02.262
Oh, I got it all right.

21:02.295 --> 21:05.065
 Great, do you want to dance?

21:05.065 --> 21:07.200
 Mom, please,
 I'll do laundry for a month?

21:09.469 --> 21:12.872
I can't, something came up,
family problems.

21:12.906 --> 21:14.774
 Is this your mother?

21:14.808 --> 21:19.512
  No, this is my beautiful,
  intelligent,
  young-looking older sister.

21:19.546 --> 21:21.581
  You know,
  your brother's pretty hot.

21:21.614 --> 21:23.083
So I've heard.

21:23.950 --> 21:25.652
I'll call you.

21:28.655 --> 21:30.623
 - Mom...
 - This is a pretty nice place.

21:30.657 --> 21:32.859
   - You boys should come back.
   - Oh, really?

21:32.892 --> 21:34.427
   What a cool mom!

21:34.461 --> 21:36.496
   Yeah, in about two years.

21:36.529 --> 21:38.565
 Oo-ooh, Mom!

21:39.299 --> 21:40.734
  No!

21:47.107 --> 21:49.743
 ( instrumental music plays )
