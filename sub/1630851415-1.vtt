WEBVTT

00:21.060 --> 00:24.000
VINCE CARTER (VOICEOVER): I
consider dunking an art form.

00:24.030 --> 00:27.160
We're creating our masterpiece
as we soar through the air.

00:27.190 --> 00:29.120
That's called art.

00:29.150 --> 00:32.040
I wanted to show
that I was a showman,

00:32.070 --> 00:34.010
and I was an entertainer.

00:34.040 --> 00:36.040
Vince could just
imagine himself

00:36.070 --> 00:39.050
doing something
with a basketball,

00:39.080 --> 00:40.230
and then he could go do it.

00:41.020 --> 00:42.170
VINCE CARTER (VOICEOVER): And
that's where I've been for 22

00:42.200 --> 00:44.100
years in the same mentality.

00:44.130 --> 00:48.090
To play as many years, you
have to grow as a player,

00:48.120 --> 00:50.100
improve as a player.

00:50.130 --> 00:51.210
That's not easy.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.190
For him to maintain his
excellence for this long

00:54.220 --> 00:56.110
is incredible.

00:56.140 --> 01:00.020
He will stand alone in a
really unique place, because he

01:00.040 --> 01:02.190
just kind of took his
own path and evolved

01:02.220 --> 01:04.060
into this amazing story.

01:04.090 --> 01:05.190
Here's how you
know what a big deal

01:05.220 --> 01:07.060
it is that Vince
was able to do it

01:07.090 --> 01:08.140
and you know how hard it is--

01:08.170 --> 01:10.070
because no one else could.

01:10.100 --> 01:11.230
That's how you know, right?

01:12.020 --> 01:14.050
If it was easy,
everybody would do it.

01:14.080 --> 01:17.000
If it was easy, anybody
else would have done it.

01:17.030 --> 01:17.190
Guess what?

01:17.220 --> 01:19.120
No one ever has.

01:19.150 --> 01:23.010
That tells you how important
Vince Carter was to the game,

01:23.040 --> 01:25.090
and that this moment
must be respected.

01:25.120 --> 01:28.080
[cheers]

01:33.160 --> 01:35.050
VINCE CARTER: I
always talk about the

01:35.080 --> 01:39.210
ending and trying to see what
does the ending look like.

01:40.000 --> 01:40.230
What does it look like?

01:41.020 --> 01:42.070
What does it feel like?

01:42.100 --> 01:44.040
How do I handle it?

01:44.070 --> 01:48.100
I make this now, at
this age, my time.

01:48.130 --> 01:49.160
And then once I
get to the arena,

01:49.190 --> 01:51.090
just kind of goes
from that me time

01:51.120 --> 01:57.110
to work time and just focusing
on preparation for the game.

01:57.140 --> 02:00.200
Because, like I say, it
takes me longer to get ready

02:00.230 --> 02:03.110
than any of the other guys.

02:03.140 --> 02:04.070
What's up, man?

02:04.100 --> 02:04.210
You good?

02:05.000 --> 02:05.130
All right.

02:05.160 --> 02:06.230
All right.

02:07.020 --> 02:08.230
VINCE CARTER: I value
these rides to the arena

02:09.020 --> 02:10.170
now this year more
than ever, because,

02:10.200 --> 02:13.000
like I said, from here on out--

02:13.030 --> 02:16.060
[chuckles] --it won't be
a ride to the arena to get

02:16.090 --> 02:17.120
ready for a basketball game.

02:22.070 --> 02:24.200
Now it turns to work mode.

02:29.200 --> 02:31.070
DOMINIQUE WILKINS: The
most difficult thing was

02:31.100 --> 02:33.170
believing that it's at the end.

02:33.200 --> 02:35.090
And that it's time.

02:35.120 --> 02:36.230
Good.

02:37.020 --> 02:38.080
DOMINIQUE WILKINS: Because
you never think it's time,

02:38.110 --> 02:41.020
but your body let's you
know when it's time.

02:41.050 --> 02:45.070
But that's the most difficult
thing-- actually saying

02:45.100 --> 02:49.010
to yourself, OK, it's over.

02:49.040 --> 02:51.090
That's the most difficult
thing for any athlete.

02:51.120 --> 02:53.130
[heartfelt piano music]

02:53.160 --> 02:55.030
REPORTER 1: Is it
kind of hard to accept

02:55.060 --> 02:56.220
that there is no ceremony?

02:57.010 --> 02:57.140
No fanfare?

02:57.170 --> 02:58.220
[inaudible]

02:59.010 --> 03:01.000
I'm not one for the
whole thing, anyway.

03:01.030 --> 03:04.130
So, if you ask a lot of people
around me, they'll tell you--

03:04.160 --> 03:08.080
you know, I'm-- [exhales]
--I'm one that, like,

03:08.110 --> 03:12.220
I'm appreciative, but, you
know, I do my time and just walk

03:13.010 --> 03:14.020
out the door is OK with me.

03:14.050 --> 03:15.060
You know?

03:15.090 --> 03:18.040
Believe it or not,
but it's cool.

03:18.070 --> 03:19.170
[laughs] Believe
me, no it's cool.

03:19.200 --> 03:20.160
I, uh--

03:20.190 --> 03:23.180
[heartfelt piano music]

03:25.170 --> 03:30.200
I just-- think it's been good.

03:34.060 --> 03:37.040
[upbeat drum music]

03:47.110 --> 03:49.200
MICHELLE CARTER: Vince
grew up in a pretty

03:49.230 --> 03:54.070
upscale suburban neighborhood,
was a good student at school.

03:54.100 --> 03:56.210
He got his work,
stayed out of trouble.

03:57.000 --> 04:00.140
VINCE CARTER: My entire family
are all educators of some sort.

04:00.170 --> 04:04.180
School teachers,
principals, you name it.

04:04.210 --> 04:07.030
So that's kind of how
our household was.

04:07.060 --> 04:12.020
ANN SMITH: I taught him
in my English class, which

04:12.050 --> 04:15.030
was wonderful, because I knew
he would do all the assignments

04:15.060 --> 04:18.160
and do what he had to do because
that was required of Vince,

04:18.190 --> 04:20.120
above everything else.

04:20.150 --> 04:23.060
VINCE CARTER: We
were a small family

04:23.090 --> 04:25.000
in the bigger scheme of things.

04:25.030 --> 04:28.220
It's my brother and I, and then
sometimes just the three of us.

04:29.010 --> 04:33.070
My aunt had one child,
and that was it.

04:33.100 --> 04:36.130
My memory is
always in the gym.

04:36.160 --> 04:40.120
[laughs] We always
ended up in the gym.

04:40.150 --> 04:42.160
VINCE CARTER: It
was very structured.

04:42.190 --> 04:45.100
You had what was expected.

04:45.130 --> 04:47.140
You know your dos and don'ts,
pleases and thank yous.

04:47.170 --> 04:50.050
Like, I mean, you were
taught to be polite.

04:50.080 --> 04:52.120
Both of our mothers
very strong women.

04:52.150 --> 04:55.030
Very strong women.

04:55.060 --> 04:58.090
Neither one of them
played any games with us.

04:58.120 --> 05:02.040
And Miss Michelle didn't
play with anybody.

05:02.070 --> 05:10.170
My only thing was being
an educator is to try

05:10.200 --> 05:15.050
to develop the whole child.

05:15.080 --> 05:18.070
You're not just going
to be an athlete.

05:18.100 --> 05:22.060
Vince played on his first
organized team at 7.

05:22.090 --> 05:26.180
Vince always played one
league up from his age.

05:26.210 --> 05:31.130
You couldn't find any
kids anywhere that had

05:31.160 --> 05:33.190
what we describe as
"God-given talent"

05:33.220 --> 05:36.110
that he has in that sport.

05:36.140 --> 05:39.080
TIFFANY SHOLTZ: He was,
even at a young age,

05:39.110 --> 05:43.020
always trying to be better
at what he was trying to do.

05:43.050 --> 05:44.160
MICHELLE CARTER:
He was in the band.

05:44.190 --> 05:49.010
He started playing the
saxophone in the fifth grade.

05:49.040 --> 05:53.050
Fast forward to the
end of their season,

05:53.080 --> 05:56.010
and he's first chair saxophone.

05:56.040 --> 05:59.080
ANN SMITH: His stepfather
was the band director,

05:59.110 --> 06:02.230
so you didn't play there either.

06:03.020 --> 06:04.170
I mean, you didn't play around.

06:04.200 --> 06:06.140
You went and did
what you had to do.

06:06.170 --> 06:08.200
MICHELLE CARTER: But
he just always excelled

06:08.230 --> 06:12.140
at basketball and, for
that matter, at volleyball,

06:12.170 --> 06:14.040
when he tried that.

06:14.070 --> 06:18.030
He went out for high jump
on the spur of the moment,

06:18.060 --> 06:20.170
he didn't even have
on the proper shoes.

06:20.200 --> 06:22.220
And he went out there and won.

06:23.010 --> 06:24.200
The fact that he even
dunked for the first time

06:24.230 --> 06:27.140
when he was in sixth
grade was crazy.

06:27.170 --> 06:33.110
The things he was doing
as a young boy, many people

06:33.140 --> 06:35.030
couldn't do.

06:35.060 --> 06:38.080
And you know, at that time,
Vince also played football.

06:38.110 --> 06:40.100
He was a quarterback.

06:40.130 --> 06:45.200
And I can remember after
one game, my husband

06:45.230 --> 06:48.160
Dennis going to
Michelle and saying,

06:48.190 --> 06:52.160
get him off the football team.

06:52.190 --> 06:54.200
He is a talented
basketball player.

06:54.230 --> 06:56.160
He's going to get
hurt out there.

06:56.190 --> 06:58.000
Get him off.

06:58.030 --> 07:00.150
[laughs] My husband
was rather forceful,

07:00.180 --> 07:04.060
and we were all good friends,
but he was sincere about that,

07:04.090 --> 07:06.060
because he felt
that Vince was going

07:06.090 --> 07:08.090
to go places in basketball.

07:08.120 --> 07:09.140
PA ANNOUNCER 1:
Featuring the Daytona

07:09.170 --> 07:11.100
Beach Mainland Buccaneers.

07:11.130 --> 07:13.100
[cheers]

07:13.130 --> 07:16.100
[cheerleaders chanting]

07:16.130 --> 07:19.140
[hip-hop music]

07:21.200 --> 07:25.100
Goal by Vince Carter.

07:25.130 --> 07:27.100
[cheers]

07:27.130 --> 07:30.100
[hip-hop music]

07:30.130 --> 07:32.070
TIFFANY SHOLTZ: I think
when it finally hit

07:32.100 --> 07:34.190
me was when he was at Mainland.

07:34.220 --> 07:39.140
At Mainland, in the old
gym, it was like prime time.

07:39.170 --> 07:41.080
I was always asking,
why do we have

07:41.110 --> 07:44.220
to get there during the freshman
game when there's two other--

07:45.010 --> 07:47.150
we have to watch another game
just to watch Vince's game.

07:47.180 --> 07:50.010
And that's how packed it was.

07:50.040 --> 07:52.150
If you weren't there by the
end of the freshman game,

07:52.180 --> 07:55.220
you were not getting a seat.

07:56.010 --> 07:58.230
That's the court we used
to play on right there.

07:59.020 --> 08:05.010
Sports was our way of peace
and our way to find a way

08:05.040 --> 08:06.100
to get out of our environment.

08:06.130 --> 08:07.210
By the time we got
to high school,

08:08.000 --> 08:09.190
we was already grown
and ready to go.

08:09.220 --> 08:12.050
PA ANNOUNCER 1:
15, Vince Carter.

08:12.080 --> 08:14.210
ROD WALDON: When you have such
a marquee player, and a player

08:15.000 --> 08:21.230
with national notoriety,
everyone wants a front seat

08:22.020 --> 08:23.160
to experience that.

08:23.190 --> 08:25.150
JOE GIDDENS: We used to play
our game at 7 o'clock at night.

08:25.180 --> 08:29.150
We had a line of people trying
to buy tickets in our gym.

08:29.180 --> 08:33.040
And it got to the point where
we had a gym full with people

08:33.070 --> 08:34.020
in both stands.

08:34.050 --> 08:35.190
It was amazing.

08:35.220 --> 08:38.110
Like, every game, no matter
where we went, was jam-packed.

08:38.140 --> 08:40.050
It was standing room only.

08:40.080 --> 08:42.110
At that time, he was getting
taller and taller and taller.

08:42.140 --> 08:44.200
VINCE CARTER: My freshman year
in high school was like 5'7".

08:44.230 --> 08:46.100
And I was a point guard.

08:46.130 --> 08:47.190
And I ended up being
the starting point

08:47.220 --> 08:49.110
guard my freshman year.

08:49.140 --> 08:51.200
And then got to 6'1"
my sophomore year.

08:51.230 --> 08:52.210
I just moved up in position--

08:53.000 --> 08:54.080
[laughs] --as I got taller.

08:54.110 --> 08:56.110
In my senior year, I
was like 6'5", 6'6".

08:56.140 --> 08:59.100
There was a high school
All-American basketball

08:59.130 --> 09:02.220
game in Detroit at the Palace.

09:03.010 --> 09:06.180
And so Kevin Garnett
and Shareef Abdur-Rahim

09:06.210 --> 09:09.190
and Paul Pierce and
Stephon Marbury.

09:09.220 --> 09:12.000
They're all there, and
Vince Carter is there.

09:12.030 --> 09:15.160
I'm one of the judges for
the slam dunk contest.

09:15.190 --> 09:21.220
And so Vince, he comes
out and does one dunk.

09:22.010 --> 09:23.210
And no one wants
to go after him.

09:24.000 --> 09:27.070
I've never seen somebody
win a slam dunk contest

09:27.100 --> 09:28.230
with just doing one dunk.

09:29.020 --> 09:31.090
TIFFANY SHOLTZ: When he
actually made drum major,

09:31.120 --> 09:34.070
oh my gosh, it was just
like one other thing

09:34.100 --> 09:36.070
that a lot of people
will come to see,

09:36.100 --> 09:37.170
because you will
never think, OK,

09:37.200 --> 09:40.160
Mr. Basketball is
actually going to be

09:40.190 --> 09:42.050
the highlight of halftime.

09:42.080 --> 09:45.020
But he would be just
dancing and just thinking

09:45.050 --> 09:46.220
that he's the best
dunker of all time, which

09:47.010 --> 09:48.070
I think he still thinks that.

09:48.100 --> 09:49.230
It was very easy to spot him.

09:50.020 --> 09:51.190
Usually, he would tell me,
Tiff, I'm gonna be on the 40,

09:51.220 --> 09:53.120
I'm going to be on the
30, I don't need that.

09:53.150 --> 09:56.150
Because he was always towering
over the whole entire band.

09:56.180 --> 09:59.200
Seconds later, he's on the
court having to play a game.

09:59.230 --> 10:01.090
So he was like--

10:01.120 --> 10:02.180
he was, like, versatile.

10:02.210 --> 10:04.110
I was like, OK, dude,
like, you're doing--

10:04.140 --> 10:06.120
you're going to be the drum
major and you're going to--

10:06.150 --> 10:09.060
[laughs] --do basketball
all at the same time?

10:09.090 --> 10:11.070
And of course he did it.

10:11.100 --> 10:13.080
It's funny when I say
this, my dad played football,

10:13.110 --> 10:18.040
but he was also in the
band as a young kid.

10:18.070 --> 10:23.070
He definitely influenced me
and pushed me when I would

10:23.100 --> 10:26.190
come down to visit in Orlando.

10:26.220 --> 10:29.220
He'd have me out
there, whether it's

10:30.010 --> 10:31.100
working on my game on my shot.

10:31.130 --> 10:33.180
His dad got remarried
to my next door neighbor,

10:33.210 --> 10:36.000
so he was always--

10:36.030 --> 10:41.000
just when he visited his
dad, he'd be next door,

10:41.030 --> 10:42.110
and we'd play.

10:42.140 --> 10:43.190
I, um--

10:43.220 --> 10:45.050
[exhales]

10:45.080 --> 10:48.010
[dramatic music]

10:48.040 --> 10:49.190
He's my dad, so I respect him.

10:49.220 --> 10:54.190
And it's no-- this is
gonna go along the lines

10:54.220 --> 10:57.060
of everything else about me--

10:57.090 --> 11:03.100
I never felt the need
to bash him publicly.

11:03.130 --> 11:06.120
It's tough sometimes, because
he was very influential

11:06.150 --> 11:08.130
in the Orlando area.

11:08.160 --> 11:11.230
And a lot of kids that
he touched because he

11:12.020 --> 11:13.180
did the midnight basketball.

11:13.210 --> 11:15.200
And he was, like, big.

11:15.230 --> 11:17.200
So when you hear his
name, you hear my name,

11:17.230 --> 11:20.050
people think it's
me, but it's him.

11:20.080 --> 11:21.230
But he was so influential
and a lot of kids

11:22.020 --> 11:24.110
grew up and, like-- so when
I started living in Orlando,

11:24.140 --> 11:26.170
these kids now are
growing up just like, man,

11:26.200 --> 11:28.060
your dad, your dad, your dad.

11:28.090 --> 11:31.160
Because, like, he's a big
time coach around there,

11:31.190 --> 11:34.210
and he's very influential
in kids' lives

11:35.000 --> 11:37.130
and in growth and success.

11:37.160 --> 11:40.190
In influence in basketball,
he had some influence.

11:40.220 --> 11:43.140
He and my uncle, Oliver Lee--

11:43.170 --> 11:45.180
my uncle played in
the NBA for a couple

11:45.210 --> 11:48.100
of years, played at Marquette.

11:48.130 --> 11:52.170
He used to heckle me
like nobody's business.

11:52.200 --> 11:54.130
When you hear him, you hear him.

11:54.160 --> 11:57.060
He's like, yo, take
that dude out, man!

11:57.090 --> 12:00.020
Hey, bro, 15, you
ain't got it tonight!

12:00.040 --> 12:01.110
Like, he's like, man--

12:01.140 --> 12:03.010
that's just him.

12:03.040 --> 12:06.060
Being the jerk helped
you get ready for you

12:06.090 --> 12:08.140
say you want to be a
professional, well, guess what?

12:08.170 --> 12:10.090
I know what it's like.

12:10.120 --> 12:13.040
This is stuff you deal with when
you go on the road and playing

12:13.070 --> 12:16.120
in a Utah, in Sacramento, where
it's loud and you can't hear,

12:16.150 --> 12:17.170
or in college, matter of fact.

12:17.200 --> 12:19.170
You go to Clemson,
you go to Duke,

12:19.200 --> 12:21.050
this is what you're
going to hear.

12:21.080 --> 12:23.090
But it's going to
be 19,000 of them.

12:23.120 --> 12:26.160
Yes, it's an empty gym, it
sounds like this, and it's me,

12:26.190 --> 12:28.170
and you can hear me loud
and clear, can't you?

12:28.200 --> 12:30.040
How is it affecting you?

12:30.070 --> 12:31.190
How are you handle it?

12:31.220 --> 12:35.110
When we saw there were 77
universities that wanted him

12:35.140 --> 12:39.180
to be a student
athlete, I thought,

12:39.210 --> 12:42.140
OK, maybe he's got a chance.

12:42.170 --> 12:46.180
Somehow, someway, I kind
of got down to six schools--

12:46.210 --> 12:51.090
Kansas, Kentucky, Florida,
Florida State, Duke, Carolina.

12:51.120 --> 12:55.210
I remember afterwards,
calling Tommy Amaker, who

12:56.000 --> 12:57.090
was an assistant coach at Duke.

12:57.120 --> 12:58.190
And I'm like, what happened?

12:58.220 --> 13:00.190
Why didn't-- why
didn't we get him?

13:00.220 --> 13:02.120
And why did he go
to North Carolina?

13:02.150 --> 13:06.070
And so we tried, but
he ended up going

13:06.100 --> 13:07.180
down the street to Chapel Hill.

13:07.210 --> 13:09.040
VINCE CARTER: It's
hard to say no.

13:09.070 --> 13:11.010
It's like, you have Dean
Smith, Bill Guthridge.

13:11.040 --> 13:12.180
It speaks for itself.

13:12.210 --> 13:17.180
One, it from my mom is like
his expectations for education

13:17.210 --> 13:19.100
and what he expected of us.

13:19.130 --> 13:21.050
And we were expected to
see in the first three rows

13:21.080 --> 13:22.190
of the classroom in the front.

13:22.220 --> 13:24.040
Pointblank.

13:24.070 --> 13:25.160
That's what was expected.

13:25.190 --> 13:28.050
So I could already see
my mom, you could see her

13:28.080 --> 13:30.150
just smiling at the home visit.

13:30.180 --> 13:33.040
She was happy about that.

13:33.070 --> 13:33.220
I was, too.

13:34.010 --> 13:35.140
She was happy.

13:35.170 --> 13:37.110
But, like, for me, if both
worlds kind of meshed together,

13:37.140 --> 13:39.130
and we were both happy, it
was kind of meant to be.

13:39.160 --> 13:41.140
So I knew I made
the right decision.

13:41.170 --> 13:44.140
[hip-hop music]

13:44.170 --> 13:46.070
[dramatic music]

13:46.100 --> 13:47.230
MICHELLE CARTER: You're at the
University of North Carolina

13:48.020 --> 13:49.130
Chapel Hill playing basketball.

13:49.160 --> 13:52.120
[cheers]

13:53.220 --> 13:55.150
GRANT HILL: Even if you
didn't watch Carolina,

13:55.180 --> 13:57.070
you saw the highlights.

13:57.100 --> 13:58.140
It was incredible.

13:58.170 --> 14:00.210
A Dukee wanted to
watch Carolina just

14:01.000 --> 14:04.150
to see what kind
of incredible dunk

14:04.180 --> 14:06.110
that he might have in the game.

14:06.140 --> 14:08.170
MICHELLE CARTER: It was a
little bit of an adjustment

14:08.200 --> 14:11.000
for him his freshman year.

14:11.030 --> 14:14.070
Then the sophomore year,
he just started to explode.

14:14.100 --> 14:15.200
[cheers]

14:15.230 --> 14:18.110
We remember Vince at Carolina.

14:18.140 --> 14:20.040
You know what I mean?

14:20.070 --> 14:25.050
So we knew what we were getting
ready to witness in the NBA.

14:25.080 --> 14:26.120
We knew it.

14:26.150 --> 14:28.080
I don't even watch
college basketball,

14:28.110 --> 14:31.040
and when Vince was
at Carolina, like,

14:31.070 --> 14:33.170
it was must-see TV for me.

14:33.200 --> 14:36.210
That's when I
figured, OK, it looks

14:37.000 --> 14:39.150
like we might be NBA-bound.

14:39.180 --> 14:41.170
ERNIE JOHNSON, JR (ON TV): It
is a night when hopes and dreams

14:41.200 --> 14:43.050
and butterflies abound.

14:43.080 --> 14:45.040
Its Draft Night 1998.

14:45.070 --> 14:47.140
You could tell he was
nervous, because it's draft day.

14:47.170 --> 14:50.080
You hear, you may go
here, you may go there,

14:50.110 --> 14:51.200
but you never know.

14:51.230 --> 14:54.230
The fourth pick was
interesting because I worked

14:55.020 --> 14:57.040
out for Toronto, obviously.

14:57.070 --> 14:59.030
Antawn didn't work
out for Toronto.

14:59.060 --> 15:03.180
With the fourth pick
in the 1998 NBA Draft,

15:03.210 --> 15:07.140
the Toronto Raptors
select Antawn Jamison

15:07.170 --> 15:09.140
from the University
of North Carolina.

15:09.170 --> 15:10.140
VINCE CARTER: He gets drafted.

15:10.170 --> 15:11.150
It was like, exciting.

15:11.180 --> 15:13.070
It was like, man, my roommate--

15:13.100 --> 15:15.110
my college roommate just got
drafted, like, that's cool.

15:15.140 --> 15:18.040
And then now fifth
pick, we're not sure.

15:18.070 --> 15:21.100
I remember my agent said
this is a possible pick.

15:21.130 --> 15:23.020
So we'll see.

15:23.050 --> 15:24.090
And then, next thing you know,
you hear your name called.

15:24.120 --> 15:26.060
The Golden State
Warriors select

15:26.090 --> 15:29.130
Vince Carter from the
University of North Carolina.

15:29.160 --> 15:31.080
[cheers, applause]

15:31.110 --> 15:33.200
VINCE CARTER: All of the things
that you think about for all

15:33.230 --> 15:36.000
these years just happened.

15:36.030 --> 15:39.140
And you watch the
draft year after year,

15:39.170 --> 15:40.230
but now you're
that person there.

15:41.020 --> 15:42.090
You don't know how to react.

15:42.120 --> 15:45.100
I remember getting the
hat and putting it on.

15:45.130 --> 15:46.190
And I remember
going up the steps,

15:46.220 --> 15:48.000
and I remember seeing Antawn.

15:48.030 --> 15:49.170
He was trying to
say something to me.

15:49.200 --> 15:51.130
And he's mouthing, and I
don't know what he's saying.

15:51.160 --> 15:52.200
I'm like, what is he saying?

15:52.230 --> 15:54.020
So I'm trying to,
like, figure it out.

15:54.050 --> 15:55.160
So I go to shake
David Stern's hand.

15:55.190 --> 15:57.090
He said, congratulations.

15:57.120 --> 15:58.230
Stand right here for a second.

15:59.020 --> 16:00.020
There's about to be a trade.

16:00.050 --> 16:01.120
I said, OK.

16:01.150 --> 16:06.060
Toronto has traded the
rights to Antawn Jamison

16:06.090 --> 16:09.080
to Golden State for
the rights to Vince

16:09.110 --> 16:12.130
Carter plus cash consideration.

16:12.160 --> 16:13.200
Oh, shoot, it's for me.

16:13.230 --> 16:15.080
[laughs]

16:15.110 --> 16:17.020
I covered the Golden
State Warriors when they--

16:17.050 --> 16:20.220
[laughs] --they
drafted Vince, and then

16:21.010 --> 16:23.090
they traded him for Antawn.

16:23.120 --> 16:27.160
And it probably goes to the
heart of like the misconception

16:27.190 --> 16:29.070
of who Vince was.

16:29.100 --> 16:31.120
Because the Warriors,
at that time,

16:31.150 --> 16:35.000
were trying to create
a better culture.

16:35.030 --> 16:36.210
Tell me about this guy's game.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
He's going to be a
tremendous player in the NBA.

16:39.030 --> 16:41.050
He's gonna be one of those
guys whose name is gonna

16:41.080 --> 16:43.010
be in the NBA for a long time.

16:43.040 --> 16:44.180
Even though I
looked at it, I went--

16:44.210 --> 16:50.120
[inhales] --there's a talent
disparity here between the two.

16:50.150 --> 16:54.170
BUTCH CARTER: We had fought
hard to get Vince drafted.

16:54.200 --> 16:58.070
The scouts thought that
there were two other players

16:58.100 --> 16:59.170
that they liked over Vince.

16:59.200 --> 17:02.220
And I thought, in
watching the video him

17:03.010 --> 17:07.150
in North Carolina, that
outside of Michael Jordan

17:07.180 --> 17:09.200
as a North Carolina
athlete, there

17:09.230 --> 17:11.110
wasn't anyone as close as Vince.

17:11.140 --> 17:14.050
And he wasn't being
used in what I thought

17:14.080 --> 17:16.150
his maximum potential was.

17:16.180 --> 17:18.210
The prior regime that had
left, Isaiah and them,

17:19.000 --> 17:22.140
had put the word out that
there was no money in Toronto.

17:22.170 --> 17:25.220
So we basically played that
to the other general managers.

17:26.010 --> 17:28.060
We'll do this deal with you,
we'll do that deal with you,

17:28.090 --> 17:31.140
and you got to give us a million
dollars, plus the transaction.

17:31.170 --> 17:35.010
We had a temporary practice
facility at a local university,

17:35.040 --> 17:36.160
Glendon College.

17:36.190 --> 17:39.100
That was OK, certainly not
the standards of NBAs today,

17:39.130 --> 17:41.150
but for back in
the NBA, it was OK.

17:41.180 --> 17:43.170
Our president told us, well,
we don't have enough money

17:43.200 --> 17:45.010
to build a practice facility.

17:45.040 --> 17:47.040
I asked him, how much
do we need, right?

17:47.070 --> 17:49.020
So the Vince Carter
trade got us started

17:49.050 --> 17:51.010
on getting the $3
million we needed

17:51.040 --> 17:52.170
to build a practice facility.

17:52.200 --> 17:55.170
So everybody talks about
what he did, and Vince

17:55.200 --> 17:59.160
created so much value in
the franchise from the night

17:59.190 --> 18:01.160
he was drafted.

18:01.190 --> 18:06.110
He independently stabilized
one NBA franchise by himself.

18:06.140 --> 18:08.000
RACHEL NICHOLS: He
legitimized so much

18:08.030 --> 18:09.160
for the Toronto Raptors.

18:09.190 --> 18:12.040
Expansion franchise teams,
they're not very good, right?

18:12.070 --> 18:14.050
I heard someone talking
about the Raptors

18:14.080 --> 18:16.100
when they first started,
I think the line was,

18:16.130 --> 18:19.010
when Vince was there, the
Raptors were three years old,

18:19.040 --> 18:20.100
and like any three
year old, they

18:20.130 --> 18:21.100
weren't very good at anything.

18:21.130 --> 18:22.220
[laughs]

18:23.010 --> 18:25.130
You know, we were having
difficulties improving.

18:25.160 --> 18:28.020
Players didn't want to
go to a losing situation.

18:28.050 --> 18:30.210
Coming off a tough
season, we're not

18:31.000 --> 18:35.200
the most attractive
destination for players,

18:35.230 --> 18:39.170
having only won 16
out of 82 games.

18:39.200 --> 18:43.140
Besides bringing in Vince,
we brought in Charles Oakley

18:43.170 --> 18:47.020
and Kevin Willis, two
tough veteran players

18:47.050 --> 18:50.100
primarily to sort of
establish the culture

18:50.130 --> 18:55.030
and to provide some
experience and leadership

18:55.060 --> 18:56.140
to the younger guys.

18:56.170 --> 18:58.160
And that worked well.

18:58.190 --> 19:00.210
It was a lockout year, so
we didn't start playing,

19:01.000 --> 19:02.080
I don't think, until December.

19:02.110 --> 19:03.170
Vince was our top rookie.

19:03.200 --> 19:06.100
And my thing was to
give him respect.

19:06.130 --> 19:08.160
And when you give
it, you receive it.

19:08.190 --> 19:10.120
And it was very, very easy.

19:10.150 --> 19:14.200
And after we started to
get to know one another,

19:14.230 --> 19:23.000
obviously, on the court, off the
court, it became like a family.

19:23.030 --> 19:28.160
When you have a nucleus of
good veterans around your two

19:28.190 --> 19:30.150
or three young players--

19:30.180 --> 19:33.200
Vince, Tracy McGrady,
Alvin Williams--

19:33.230 --> 19:37.010
guys like that that
are hungry, guys

19:37.040 --> 19:40.130
want to learn and take
on this responsibility

19:40.160 --> 19:42.010
to lead the team--

19:42.040 --> 19:44.110
and Vince being our number
one guy at that time--

19:44.140 --> 19:46.140
it was just fun to
watch him develop.

19:46.170 --> 19:49.150
T-Mac and I were just
out there playing, hooping,

19:49.180 --> 19:52.100
and just doing what we do.

19:52.130 --> 19:54.110
And that's what made it cool.

19:54.140 --> 19:58.000
They complemented each
other well, I believe.

19:58.030 --> 20:01.070
They played together well,
and they fed off each other.

20:01.100 --> 20:03.160
When I was asked to
come do this interview,

20:03.190 --> 20:06.210
I went through my notes,
and I pull out the note from

20:07.000 --> 20:12.160
February, I think, 22nd of '99.

20:12.190 --> 20:16.030
It's the 12th game
of a 50-game season.

20:16.060 --> 20:19.000
We're playing Chicago
at home, and I've

20:19.030 --> 20:22.000
got all these notes of stuff
that Vince Carter can't do.

20:22.030 --> 20:24.180
It was just a lot of stuff
running through my mind

20:24.210 --> 20:27.030
how to continuously improve him.

20:27.060 --> 20:29.110
You know, I have to
say that I was one

20:29.150 --> 20:33.060
of the luckiest coaches, because
Vince was one of those players

20:33.090 --> 20:36.190
that, if you gave
him the "why" of why

20:36.220 --> 20:40.190
he needed to do something, he
could pick it up very easily.

20:40.220 --> 20:45.130
Canada was and will
always be a hockey country,

20:45.160 --> 20:48.010
but I think he really
inspired a lot of kids

20:48.040 --> 20:52.090
to pick up balls and head
to the court, you know?

20:52.120 --> 20:54.120
I don't think that that was
really something that anybody

20:54.150 --> 20:56.020
was doing before he came along.

20:56.050 --> 20:59.030
But just because of how
electrifying he was,

20:59.060 --> 21:04.140
his highlight reels, he just
made basketball seem cool.

21:04.170 --> 21:07.000
I really think Vince
had a huge impact

21:07.030 --> 21:10.100
on how people in Canada
appreciate basketball,

21:10.130 --> 21:12.030
and that exists today.

21:12.060 --> 21:15.090
JASON KIDD: It just shows what
Vince is capable of doing.

21:15.120 --> 21:18.000
Being in college, there's
a lot of excitement

21:18.030 --> 21:19.210
coming to the league.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.110
But he just goes with the flow.

21:21.140 --> 21:25.050
But he ends up going
to a team in Toronto

21:25.080 --> 21:27.150
and understanding
that now not just

21:27.180 --> 21:31.040
that he has a state or city,
but he has a country behind him.

21:31.070 --> 21:35.010
And he didn't he didn't sell
them short, because he came

21:35.040 --> 21:37.110
on the scene and he exploded.

21:37.140 --> 21:39.090
And being able to win
Rookie of the Year

21:39.120 --> 21:43.120
just showed how talented he was.

21:43.150 --> 21:46.140
[hip-hop music]

21:49.120 --> 21:52.060
MAN 1: The man that has turned
the slam dunk into an art.

21:52.090 --> 21:56.170
That's the fabulous
"Dr. J" Julius Erving.

21:56.200 --> 21:59.000
VINCE CARTER: Dr. J was my hero.

21:59.030 --> 22:00.120
Point blank, period.

22:00.150 --> 22:03.150
And he so happened to be
a pretty darn good dunker

22:03.180 --> 22:05.010
himself.

22:05.040 --> 22:09.160
Growing up, I taped the
dunk contest every year

22:09.190 --> 22:14.020
to where I remember sometimes
when you play a tape too much,

22:14.050 --> 22:16.120
it starts to get blurry, and
the screen starts to jump

22:16.150 --> 22:18.090
and all that.

22:18.120 --> 22:20.140
[cheers]

22:20.170 --> 22:23.160
In my prime, I mean, I
started dunking the ball

22:23.190 --> 22:27.180
when I used to do
clinics for Converse.

22:27.210 --> 22:30.210
So that was--

22:31.000 --> 22:36.000
I always gave the
audience a dunk show.

22:36.030 --> 22:39.180
So I'm trying to figure out
what he's doing pre-routine,

22:39.210 --> 22:41.040
before that dunk.

22:41.070 --> 22:44.020
And that's what helped
me expand my creativity.

22:44.050 --> 22:47.140
You have guys who can jump
really high that can dunk,

22:47.170 --> 22:49.000
and you got guys who
can jump really high

22:49.030 --> 22:51.150
with creativity, which
kind of separates

22:51.180 --> 22:53.160
you from everyone else.

22:53.190 --> 22:56.220
Playing in the NBA was
a dream, obviously,

22:57.010 --> 23:01.050
but the dunk contest is
what I, like, I studied.

23:01.080 --> 23:02.190
Like, I was like, this is it.

23:02.220 --> 23:05.130
The reason Vince's slam
dunk contest was so good,

23:05.160 --> 23:08.120
he was just head-and-shoulders
above everybody else.

23:08.150 --> 23:11.110
It wasn't-- as we say,
it wasn't a fair fight.

23:11.140 --> 23:13.120
I knew he was a favorite.

23:13.150 --> 23:15.170
I don't know if the world
knew he was a favorite.

23:15.200 --> 23:20.060
All he did was say, here
come a handful of dunks.

23:20.090 --> 23:21.110
Good luck to the rest of you.

23:21.140 --> 23:22.200
VINCE CARTER: Right
about now, I am

23:22.230 --> 23:25.200
thinking about all the
times I tried this dunk,

23:25.230 --> 23:27.200
and it looked awful.

23:27.230 --> 23:31.020
As I put that head down, that's
when I was like, we got this.

23:31.050 --> 23:34.010
[ecstatic cheers]

23:34.040 --> 23:35.070
KENNY SMITH: Let's go home!

23:35.100 --> 23:37.130
Let's go home,
ladies and gentlemen!

23:37.160 --> 23:39.170
DIRK NOWITZKI: It was all before
he even got to the finals.

23:39.200 --> 23:42.050
Really, after the first
dunk, that was already it.

23:42.080 --> 23:45.090
I mean, that was a dunk
I'll always remember.

23:45.120 --> 23:49.060
VINCE CARTER: I wanted to
set the tone first dunk.

23:49.090 --> 23:51.110
Not, oh, OK, all
right, he's warming up.

23:51.140 --> 23:52.180
No, no.

23:52.210 --> 23:53.170
I'm ready.

23:53.200 --> 23:55.000
I'm here.

23:55.030 --> 23:58.120
Like, if you don't
get on this level--

23:58.150 --> 24:01.110
The dunk contest is on
one side of the floor,

24:01.140 --> 24:03.190
and when Vince would
come up to dunk,

24:03.220 --> 24:06.010
the whole arena would
run to the other side.

24:06.040 --> 24:07.230
It was that crazy.

24:08.020 --> 24:11.110
On this next dunk, I'm
trying to show distance

24:11.140 --> 24:14.090
while doing a windmill.

24:14.120 --> 24:16.150
[ecstatic cheers]

24:16.180 --> 24:20.130
MARV ALBERT: Kenny Smith, the
only judge not to award a 10.

24:20.160 --> 24:21.220
What's going on?

24:22.010 --> 24:26.050
The nine dunk was a
10 in any other setting.

24:26.080 --> 24:29.010
And that first dunk just
set a tone in the building.

24:29.040 --> 24:31.050
But I said, that is the new 10.

24:31.080 --> 24:34.020
VINCE CARTER: So with this
one, we had to use a teammate.

24:34.050 --> 24:36.010
So we get out there, it's like,
all right, what am I doing?

24:36.040 --> 24:38.150
I said, stand right
here and just--

24:38.180 --> 24:41.100
just bounce it,
and then back up.

24:41.130 --> 24:43.050
He's like, man, what
are you about to do?

24:43.080 --> 24:45.070
I said, you'll see.

24:45.100 --> 24:47.040
MIKE FRATELLO: --incurred an
injury dealing with weights

24:47.070 --> 24:48.180
in the weight room.

24:48.210 --> 24:49.190
So he's stitched up in the
left hand doing all this.

24:49.220 --> 24:50.170
[ecstatic cheers]

24:50.200 --> 24:51.150
MARV ALBERT: Oh!

24:51.180 --> 24:53.110
KENNY SMITH: It's over!

24:53.140 --> 24:55.180
It's over, ladies and gentlemen!

24:55.210 --> 24:57.120
I don't have,
like, catchphrases.

24:57.150 --> 24:59.220
And I don't know if he heard me
or not, but at the same time,

25:00.020 --> 25:02.100
he goes like this, "It's over."

25:02.130 --> 25:05.040
And Kenny going crazy
telling me, it's over!

25:05.070 --> 25:06.120
It's over!

25:06.150 --> 25:09.110
I just attempted a
dunk that I've never

25:09.140 --> 25:11.140
tried before, like somebody--

25:11.170 --> 25:13.190
the dunk gods or
somebody, somebody--

25:13.220 --> 25:14.100
thank you.

25:14.130 --> 25:15.180
[laughs]

25:15.210 --> 25:17.160
He pointed up at
the rafters like this,

25:17.190 --> 25:20.160
and that forever stuck with me.

25:20.190 --> 25:23.130
So when it came down to
2016, we were in Toronto,

25:23.160 --> 25:27.160
I made sure I pointed
up just like he did,

25:27.190 --> 25:29.040
as a tribute to Vince.

25:29.070 --> 25:30.120
I had to do it.

25:30.150 --> 25:32.170
I am literally
making these dunks

25:32.200 --> 25:36.080
up right here in front of you
tonight and pulling them off.

25:36.110 --> 25:37.140
You can't tell me nothing.

25:37.170 --> 25:38.130
It's over!

25:38.160 --> 25:40.000
You can't tell me nothing.

25:40.030 --> 25:43.090
RIC BUCHER: He was a
genius in a physical way,

25:43.120 --> 25:47.070
in that, like, he
could just imagine

25:47.100 --> 25:50.210
something and then execute it.

25:51.000 --> 25:55.120
You know, these unbelievable
physical acts that,

25:55.150 --> 25:57.020
for most people,
would be like, I got

25:57.050 --> 25:58.200
to do this over and over again.

25:58.230 --> 26:00.120
Dunk number four,
what do I want

26:00.150 --> 26:02.230
to accomplish in this dunk?

26:03.020 --> 26:06.200
As I turn around, I said,
like, a quick prayer, OK,

26:06.230 --> 26:08.090
don't kill yourself.

26:08.120 --> 26:09.120
So when I walk by, I'm
just rubbing it last second

26:09.150 --> 26:11.100
just to say, just
to kind of prep

26:11.130 --> 26:13.120
it for this, because I don't
know if it's going to hurt

26:13.150 --> 26:15.000
or not.

26:15.030 --> 26:16.210
And as I go, I just
remember taking that one-two

26:17.000 --> 26:18.120
and jumping up high.

26:18.150 --> 26:20.100
MARV ALBERT: Carter with his
first on the final round!

26:20.130 --> 26:22.090
[laughs]

26:22.120 --> 26:25.040
I close my eyes to hold on.

26:25.070 --> 26:29.050
And I wanted to hear nothing.

26:29.080 --> 26:34.180
I think we were just all in
awe of what he did that night.

26:34.210 --> 26:36.120
VINCE CARTER: I just
remember landing like--

26:36.150 --> 26:39.030
[sighs] --look around, and the
first thing you're going to see

26:39.060 --> 26:40.200
is Shaq's face.

26:40.230 --> 26:43.220
And it wasn't that he just
stuck his whole arm in there,

26:44.010 --> 26:46.150
it's like he put it
there and just kind

26:46.180 --> 26:48.160
of gave you a couple of these.

26:48.190 --> 26:50.100
Because he knew
that people were

26:50.130 --> 26:53.090
going to have to catch up with
the idea of what he just did.

26:53.120 --> 26:54.230
Because it wasn't
through the legs,

26:55.020 --> 26:57.070
it wasn't the other things
that he did, it was,

26:57.100 --> 27:00.020
this dude just went so
high that he basically just

27:00.050 --> 27:03.150
jammed his arm into the basket.

27:03.180 --> 27:06.170
He said-- afterwards,
he said he did stuff

27:06.200 --> 27:08.040
that he had never practiced.

27:08.070 --> 27:12.050
[laughs] So it was like
creativity on the spot.

27:12.080 --> 27:14.020
That's probably
why it was so good.

27:14.050 --> 27:16.010
He just owned the night.

27:16.040 --> 27:17.170
He owned the arena.

27:17.200 --> 27:20.090
And, to me, it will always
be the single greatest dunk

27:20.120 --> 27:23.060
performance that I've ever seen.

27:23.090 --> 27:27.080
He's in a class by himself
when it comes to dunking.

27:27.110 --> 27:29.150
Like, he's simply in a
class by-- you don't--

27:29.180 --> 27:31.000
you can mention
whoever you want.

27:31.030 --> 27:33.000
There's some great
dunkers out here.

27:33.030 --> 27:35.090
You can mention all
those guys, and I will--

27:35.120 --> 27:37.000
ditto.

27:37.030 --> 27:45.170
But when you try to compare
somebody to Vince Carter,

27:45.200 --> 27:47.050
I don't want to hear it.

27:47.080 --> 27:49.060
It was a whole
different environment.

27:49.090 --> 27:51.200
He ignited a country
with a dunk contest.

27:51.230 --> 27:54.170
He put Canadian
basketball on the map.

27:54.200 --> 27:58.100
REPORTER 1: The Toronto Raptors
basketball team hit the court

27:58.130 --> 28:00.110
at the Air Canada Center.

28:00.140 --> 28:03.030
The crowd went
crazy when the dunk

28:03.060 --> 28:06.220
master himself, Vince Carter,
made his grand appearance.

28:07.010 --> 28:08.150
[cheers]

28:08.180 --> 28:10.100
[upbeat funk music]

28:10.130 --> 28:13.130
Vinsanity, to me, it
means the dawn of a new era.

28:13.160 --> 28:15.120
The dawn of a new culture.

28:15.150 --> 28:16.180
Vince was taking
over the league.

28:16.210 --> 28:18.150
He was going crazy, man.

28:18.180 --> 28:21.150
He had now established that
he was more than a dunker.

28:21.180 --> 28:24.220
He was scoring 50 balls,
40 balls, 30 balls,

28:25.010 --> 28:26.050
night after night after night.

28:26.080 --> 28:28.060
Half man, half amazing, right?

28:28.090 --> 28:30.220
Only I think at some point,
he just became all amazing.

28:31.010 --> 28:34.110
You know, with me, like,
we would be in a locker room,

28:34.140 --> 28:40.020
and we knew we was getting
ready to play against Vince.

28:40.050 --> 28:44.090
And all I was just telling the
big men, just watch your head.

28:44.120 --> 28:46.150
[laughs] You know what I mean?

28:46.180 --> 28:49.050
Because he will
make you a poster.

28:49.080 --> 28:51.080
NICK DEPAULA:
"Vinsanity" is cool.

28:51.110 --> 28:52.220
And I think "Air
Canada" is probably

28:53.010 --> 28:54.190
the better one, though, because
I grew up in Sacramento.

28:54.220 --> 28:56.150
Jason Williams was
a rookie that year.

28:56.180 --> 28:59.130
This was pre-Instagram,
pre-House of Highlights,

28:59.160 --> 29:01.070
pre-internet, everything.

29:01.100 --> 29:04.160
And so, for a guy to be in
Toronto, and it's the, I think,

29:04.190 --> 29:07.040
fifth year of the
franchise even,

29:07.070 --> 29:09.130
he really opened the door
to the whole country.

29:09.160 --> 29:11.140
And so I think that's the piece,
when you look at the legacy,

29:11.170 --> 29:13.140
that really sticks out
to me is like how much he

29:13.170 --> 29:14.220
could put that city on the map.

29:15.010 --> 29:16.100
DWIGHT POWELL: Even
though he might not

29:16.130 --> 29:18.210
have been Canadian, like,
a lot of us kind of just

29:19.000 --> 29:20.120
accepted that he might be.

29:20.150 --> 29:23.010
Like, we want him
to be, and that

29:23.040 --> 29:26.090
was a big part of I think
of a lot of our development

29:26.120 --> 29:27.210
at that age.

29:28.000 --> 29:29.200
REPORTER 2: With one of
his signature slam dunks,

29:29.230 --> 29:33.000
Toronto Raptor Vince
Carter inaugurated

29:33.030 --> 29:35.080
a new state of the
art basketball court

29:35.110 --> 29:37.070
in Etobicoke today.

29:37.100 --> 29:40.220
Carter, through his charity,
the Embassy of Hope Foundation,

29:41.010 --> 29:44.180
built an NBA-sized court with
a pro surface and lighting

29:44.210 --> 29:48.230
system valued at $130,000.

29:49.020 --> 29:51.030
It's a gift to the
kids in the Dixon

29:51.060 --> 29:52.200
and Islington neighborhoods.

29:52.230 --> 29:55.060
I just hope it creates a lot
of great basketball players.

29:55.090 --> 29:57.030
I mean, we're not
here to really create

29:57.060 --> 29:59.070
NBA superstars or
anything, but I think just

29:59.100 --> 30:01.200
instilling confidence
in each and everybody

30:01.230 --> 30:03.200
here and giving them
some place to play.

30:03.230 --> 30:05.140
I'll never forget,
we went to the mall,

30:05.170 --> 30:06.220
I'm with Vince Carter.

30:07.010 --> 30:08.060
And at the time, Vince
Carter was, like,

30:08.090 --> 30:09.180
really Vince Carter in Toronto.

30:09.210 --> 30:11.070
Like, everybody knew Vince
Carter, so it was, like,

30:11.100 --> 30:12.150
people looking.

30:12.180 --> 30:14.020
And then it got to
the point where we had

30:14.050 --> 30:16.230
to run out the mall, like run.

30:17.020 --> 30:18.210
We went downstairs,
got to the car,

30:19.000 --> 30:20.160
and when we got in
front of the mall,

30:20.190 --> 30:22.120
we got surrounded by people.

30:22.150 --> 30:23.210
Like, it was crazy.

30:24.000 --> 30:25.160
Like, people around
the car, Vince!

30:25.190 --> 30:26.200
Vince!

30:26.230 --> 30:28.070
surrounded, but
we couldn't drive.

30:28.100 --> 30:30.000
And I was just like--

30:30.030 --> 30:32.100
[exhales] --awe,
like, I was in awe.

30:32.130 --> 30:33.200
My mouth was open.

30:33.230 --> 30:35.100
Vince was like, man, I
told you this was crazy.

30:35.130 --> 30:38.160
It didn't take long
before Vince's face

30:38.190 --> 30:45.060
was on bus benches, buses,
and sides of condos.

30:45.090 --> 30:46.210
Just everywhere.

30:47.000 --> 30:48.150
RACHEL NICHOLS: Most players
are playing for their city

30:48.180 --> 30:50.140
or for an adopted fan base.

30:50.170 --> 30:53.210
Playing for and having the
responsibility of not only

30:54.000 --> 30:56.090
being the star for
an entire country,

30:56.120 --> 31:00.180
in terms of that sport, but also
for a relatively new franchise

31:00.210 --> 31:03.050
that basically was
depending on Vince to take

31:03.080 --> 31:04.120
them to the promised land.

31:04.150 --> 31:05.200
The first time they
made the playoffs

31:05.230 --> 31:07.090
was because of Vince Carter.

31:07.120 --> 31:10.040
What they were going to do
internationally and sort

31:10.070 --> 31:11.110
of making their
mark in the league

31:11.140 --> 31:13.180
was going to be because
of Vince Carter.

31:13.210 --> 31:14.130
That's a lot.

31:17.090 --> 31:20.060
[music playing]

31:23.020 --> 31:24.150
Life is a little different.

31:24.180 --> 31:26.210
A little more media
coming around.

31:27.000 --> 31:28.060
My confidence is at
an all-time high.

31:28.090 --> 31:30.200
I'm playing pretty
good basketball.

31:30.230 --> 31:35.050
I received a phone call
from USA Basketball,

31:35.080 --> 31:41.040
and them saying, we want you on
because Tom Gugliotta got hurt,

31:41.070 --> 31:44.020
and would I accept.

31:44.050 --> 31:45.100
"Would I"-- what?

31:45.130 --> 31:47.110
Would I accept?

31:47.140 --> 31:50.160
Man, can't even tell
you what I said.

31:50.190 --> 31:53.070
Watching the Dream Team,
watching Dream Team II--

31:53.100 --> 31:57.030
so you're talking
about a '92, '96--

31:57.060 --> 32:01.050
we're that next group
after Dream Team II.

32:01.080 --> 32:04.130
I was just elated
to join the group.

32:04.160 --> 32:07.080
I remember getting that jersey
and taking those photos--

32:07.110 --> 32:10.140
[chuckles] --because I remember
seeing the original photo.

32:10.170 --> 32:13.080
And then all of a sudden,
I see the new photo,

32:13.110 --> 32:15.090
like, they Photoshop
me right on in.

32:15.120 --> 32:16.160
And I was just sitting
there like this,

32:16.190 --> 32:19.020
I was like, I took
that picture by myself.

32:19.050 --> 32:21.180
JASON KIDD: When we got
Vince for that 2000 Olympics

32:21.210 --> 32:24.110
through Australia, we all
knew once he took flight,

32:24.140 --> 32:26.000
no one was gonna jump with him.

32:26.030 --> 32:27.090
I was excited.

32:27.120 --> 32:29.100
I think Gary Payton
was excited, because we

32:29.130 --> 32:32.140
had another weapon that we could
throw a lob to above the rim.

32:32.170 --> 32:34.000
ANNOUNCER 1 (VOICEOVER):
Kidd in the paint.

32:34.030 --> 32:35.050
Still goes right at it.

32:35.080 --> 32:36.060
VINCE CARTER: I
don't know how Gary

32:36.090 --> 32:38.100
Payton misses that easy layup.

32:38.130 --> 32:40.040
Let's start by that.

32:40.070 --> 32:44.130
I'm thankful for it, because
it became a historic play.

32:44.160 --> 32:46.040
It was just one of
those things that right

32:46.070 --> 32:48.030
place at the right time.

32:48.060 --> 32:50.190
Guy gets the ball, he throws
a behind-the-back pass,

32:50.220 --> 32:57.080
and I see the lane, and I was
like, I'm jumping too far.

32:57.110 --> 32:59.210
As I hit him, I'm
looking past him.

33:00.020 --> 33:01.110
ANNOUNCER 2 (VOICEOVER):
Vince Carter inside--

33:01.140 --> 33:02.090
ANNOUNCER 3 (VOICEOVER): Oh!

33:02.120 --> 33:04.140
Oh!

33:04.170 --> 33:06.150
VINCE CARTER: I'm celebrating
I made it, because I

33:06.180 --> 33:08.080
knew I jumped too far.

33:08.110 --> 33:13.110
Meanwhile, KG is cheering for
something totally different.

33:13.140 --> 33:17.170
And after the game,
Gary Payton actually had

33:17.200 --> 33:20.170
the play on their camcorder.

33:20.200 --> 33:24.070
That's how I found out
that I jumped over him.

33:24.100 --> 33:29.000
When he jumps and takes
off, it's like in slow-mo.

33:29.030 --> 33:32.110
You go, did we just see
him jump over this guy?

33:32.140 --> 33:34.020
It was just incredible.

33:34.050 --> 33:37.210
You know, that was just a
tribute to his athleticism,

33:38.000 --> 33:41.060
his creativity, and
what a good adrenaline

33:41.090 --> 33:43.010
rush can do for a person.

33:43.040 --> 33:47.130
To get over a whole seven-footer
and dunk it clear with barely

33:47.160 --> 33:49.070
pushing off, that's
like one of the most

33:49.100 --> 33:51.100
ridiculous dunks of all time.

33:51.130 --> 33:53.060
We still talk
about it to this day.

33:53.090 --> 33:55.040
And it kind of
launched the shoe,

33:55.070 --> 33:58.000
too, because he was
in a transition,

33:58.030 --> 34:00.080
I think, from Puma to Nike.

34:00.110 --> 34:03.040
And this is when the
Shock was coming.

34:03.070 --> 34:06.090
And so when he did
that, it was incredible.

34:06.120 --> 34:09.070
I tried to put on those
Shox, it didn't work for me.

34:09.100 --> 34:10.180
I didn't jump like that.

34:10.210 --> 34:13.190
[dramatic music]

34:26.020 --> 34:27.070
RACHEL NICHOLS:
Vince, in particular,

34:27.100 --> 34:28.060
just didn't have a
great first playoffs,

34:28.090 --> 34:29.060
which of course he didn't.

34:29.090 --> 34:30.220
I think he was 23 years old.

34:31.010 --> 34:32.220
You just need the experience
of playing in the playoffs

34:33.010 --> 34:34.170
and understanding
what it's about.

34:34.200 --> 34:37.180
Because it's a totally different
basketball game than playing

34:37.210 --> 34:40.020
in regular season at any point.

34:40.050 --> 34:42.230
The Knicks beat us down.

34:43.020 --> 34:45.130
Took a little abuse
from the media,

34:45.160 --> 34:47.200
just because, oh, he
couldn't get his team to win.

34:47.230 --> 34:49.150
You know, they were
just better than us.

34:49.180 --> 34:50.220
And we were learning.

34:51.010 --> 34:52.160
And I think T-Mac
had a great series.

34:52.190 --> 34:54.160
GLEN GRUNWALD: It was a positive
sign, even though we got swept,

34:54.190 --> 34:56.110
I think.

34:56.140 --> 34:58.040
It was those games
were pretty close,

34:58.070 --> 35:00.130
and we showed that we
were pretty competitive.

35:00.160 --> 35:04.170
It was a real sign
that we had, again,

35:04.200 --> 35:07.200
taken another big step
forward in establishing

35:07.230 --> 35:10.070
ourselves as a good franchise.

35:10.100 --> 35:12.050
One of the key
issues we faced was

35:12.080 --> 35:13.220
the Tracy McGrady free agency.

35:14.010 --> 35:17.000
Back then, there was a
different rookie contract

35:17.030 --> 35:18.170
when a player got drafted.

35:18.200 --> 35:21.150
The potential loss
of Tracy and his

35:21.180 --> 35:24.050
know inability to commit
one way or the other

35:24.080 --> 35:26.200
to signing with us or
another team sort of put

35:26.230 --> 35:28.040
the team in a real bind.

35:28.070 --> 35:29.140
You want everything
to be smooth.

35:29.170 --> 35:32.070
When you're trying to
keep a guy like a T-Mac

35:32.100 --> 35:36.090
with all the potential, you want
everything in your organization

35:36.120 --> 35:37.220
to be running smooth.

35:38.010 --> 35:40.010
And it kind of just started
to get a little bumpy.

35:40.040 --> 35:42.160
In my end the year
meeting, I presented

35:42.190 --> 35:49.090
that, if Grunwald and I
could sign Tracy McGrady,

35:49.120 --> 35:52.190
would the franchise consider
moving Grunwald to president

35:52.220 --> 35:55.070
and give me the
coach and GM title.

35:55.100 --> 35:58.190
I think that Tracy, with the
style that they were playing

35:58.220 --> 36:02.160
in Toronto and sort of the way
the Raptors coaches used him,

36:02.190 --> 36:05.020
he certainly didn't
feel like a main guy.

36:05.050 --> 36:08.100
And that was part of why he
wanted to depart for Orlando.

36:08.130 --> 36:10.120
I didn't get as much
playing time as he did.

36:10.150 --> 36:12.110
That was Vince Carter's show.

36:12.140 --> 36:13.190
Couldn't talk me out of it.

36:13.220 --> 36:15.100
I mean, I hated--

36:15.130 --> 36:17.020
Vince, I hated to leave you,
but it's a business, baby.

36:17.050 --> 36:20.160
[laughs] I hated to
leave, but, you know,

36:20.190 --> 36:22.060
I had to do what's best for me.

36:22.090 --> 36:23.220
It hurt a little bit.

36:24.010 --> 36:28.180
You know, but that's the way
it goes, and I slept on it.

36:28.220 --> 36:31.030
So what now?

36:31.060 --> 36:34.000
But, definitely, it's
tough to swallow.

36:34.030 --> 36:36.090
I guess when they feel--
you think they feel one way,

36:36.120 --> 36:39.160
and then they leave, here
comes the truth, I guess.

36:39.190 --> 36:41.200
When two guys aren't talking
directly to each other,

36:41.230 --> 36:44.100
then it just becomes, well,
he said this about you.

36:44.130 --> 36:47.090
What I remember is Charles
Oakley getting in the middle,

36:47.120 --> 36:49.100
basically, and
handing one of them

36:49.130 --> 36:51.060
the phone that the other
one was on and saying,

36:51.090 --> 36:52.200
here, work this out.

36:52.230 --> 36:56.000
We were too
close and too tight

36:56.030 --> 36:59.060
and having too much fun
together for this to seem real.

36:59.090 --> 37:02.010
When Tracy elected to leave
to go to the Orlando Magic,

37:02.040 --> 37:03.190
it was--

37:03.220 --> 37:05.140
I don't think it hurt
us that much initially,

37:05.170 --> 37:07.070
but I think over
the course of time,

37:07.100 --> 37:10.030
to lose a talent
like Tracy McGrady,

37:10.060 --> 37:12.150
was a big setback for
the long-term development

37:12.180 --> 37:14.030
of the franchise.

37:14.060 --> 37:16.140
When I heard him say,
I'm getting an opportunity

37:16.170 --> 37:21.040
to play in front of my family,
my home crowd, like, where I'm

37:21.070 --> 37:24.160
from, I'm like, shoot, if
I had that opportunity,

37:24.190 --> 37:26.000
I'd do it, too.

37:26.030 --> 37:27.160
So there's no ill
will, no hard feelings.

37:27.190 --> 37:30.080
The sad part was, if Tracy
would have been just drafted

37:30.110 --> 37:34.110
out of high school where he
lived and come to Toronto,

37:34.140 --> 37:39.060
he would not have had such a tug
of heart to go back to Florida.

37:39.090 --> 37:41.190
You know, everyone
wanted to resign Tracy.

37:41.220 --> 37:43.210
Vince wanted him back.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.170
But that was one of those
difficult situations

37:46.200 --> 37:49.000
that an organization
has to go through.

37:49.030 --> 37:53.200
Now the fans and everybody
else, all right, T-Mac leaves,

37:53.230 --> 37:55.120
what happens to us?

37:55.150 --> 37:58.130
[dramatic music]

38:03.230 --> 38:05.190
Fortunately for us
the next year, we

38:05.220 --> 38:07.220
play the New York Knicks again.

38:08.010 --> 38:10.040
And we were able
to win that series,

38:10.070 --> 38:12.090
and we closed it out on
their court, which was crazy.

38:12.120 --> 38:14.030
PLAY-BY-PLAY ANNOUNCER
4: The game is over.

38:14.060 --> 38:18.110
The Toronto Raptors coming in,
and in only their second year,

38:18.140 --> 38:20.040
making the playoffs.

38:20.070 --> 38:21.070
RACHEL NICHOLS: The fact that
they were able to come back

38:21.100 --> 38:22.220
the next year.

38:23.010 --> 38:24.080
And I really think it says
something about Vince Carter

38:24.110 --> 38:26.000
that you're playing
the same opponent,

38:26.030 --> 38:28.120
you're put back in the same
situation at Madison Square

38:28.150 --> 38:30.030
Garden, and they got it done.

38:30.060 --> 38:32.110
You have to put past
the historic moment

38:32.140 --> 38:33.200
and the big win.

38:33.230 --> 38:35.160
Now it's a whole new challenge.

38:35.190 --> 38:37.210
It's the next round, It's a
little tougher, because you're

38:38.000 --> 38:39.100
playing a better team.

38:39.130 --> 38:41.000
MARV ALBERT: Here
in Philadelphia,

38:41.030 --> 38:43.140
we're getting ready before
the 76ers and the Raptors.

38:43.170 --> 38:46.120
It's Game 1 of the best of 7,
a match-up of Allen Iverson

38:46.150 --> 38:47.170
and Vince Carter.

38:47.200 --> 38:50.040
Whatever AI was
doing for his team,

38:50.070 --> 38:52.190
I needed to do for
my team but better.

38:52.220 --> 38:55.190
When you talk about Vince
and AI in that playoff series,

38:55.220 --> 38:57.190
it was just one of
those TV moments.

38:57.220 --> 39:03.000
AI was by far one of
the most gifted scores.

39:03.030 --> 39:04.140
He was their leader.

39:04.170 --> 39:07.040
And there's another situation
of a guy understanding

39:07.070 --> 39:11.120
that he's the man, and his
ability to score was needed.

39:11.150 --> 39:18.150
Definitely a war, obviously,
because it came down to Game 7.

39:18.180 --> 39:24.110
So it was tough
for us in Toronto.

39:24.140 --> 39:25.150
It was tough for them in Philly.

39:25.180 --> 39:28.110
If you love
basketball, that series

39:28.140 --> 39:30.010
was what you wanted to see--

39:30.040 --> 39:33.090
Allen Iverson with just
everything about the playground

39:33.120 --> 39:35.050
coming out in that series.

39:35.080 --> 39:39.210
And then Vince Carter with just
the spectacular athleticism.

39:40.000 --> 39:43.080
And the way he moved, and
you saw it in that series,

39:43.110 --> 39:46.070
it's just like he's
lightning all over the court.

39:46.100 --> 39:48.000
And they're going
back and forth,

39:48.030 --> 39:50.180
and the fact that that series
got to a game 7 is perfect.

39:50.210 --> 39:52.060
We felt like we
can go out there

39:52.090 --> 39:54.170
and compete and win the series.

39:54.200 --> 39:57.190
Getting to Game 7, that's
where the pressure was.

39:57.220 --> 40:00.000
We got to figure out
a way to have one more

40:00.030 --> 40:02.120
point than this team to
move on to the Eastern

40:02.150 --> 40:04.060
Conference Final.

40:04.090 --> 40:07.010
Now, with me, I made a little
tougher, because, that morning,

40:07.040 --> 40:08.140
I chose to graduate
from college.

40:12.110 --> 40:13.030
My favorite people.

40:13.060 --> 40:13.200
WOMAN: Mm-hmm.

40:18.170 --> 40:22.010
There it is.

40:22.040 --> 40:24.210
My diploma.

40:25.000 --> 40:27.210
It's already been a busy day
for Toronto's Vince Carter.

40:28.000 --> 40:30.110
Vince arrived in Chapel
Hill at about 9:00 AM

40:30.140 --> 40:32.180
to attend his college
graduation ceremony.

40:32.210 --> 40:34.020
VINCE CARTER: We were
having a practice,

40:34.050 --> 40:37.050
and I went to every
player on our team,

40:37.080 --> 40:38.210
do you have a problem with this?

40:39.000 --> 40:40.220
I got a "no, I don't
have a problem with it"

40:41.010 --> 40:45.100
from every player on the
team, management, whatever.

40:45.130 --> 40:53.020
Fly to North Carolina, I get
to the hotel, turn on ESPN,

40:53.050 --> 40:55.110
all of a sudden, there's a
couple of players on the team

40:55.140 --> 40:58.180
have now changed their
story and said they

40:58.210 --> 41:01.090
have a problem with me going.

41:01.120 --> 41:02.200
MAN 2: People said one
thing, you got back,

41:02.230 --> 41:04.050
and they felt another way.

41:04.080 --> 41:06.080
You want to tell us
who those people were?

41:06.110 --> 41:07.060
No, that's all right.

41:07.090 --> 41:10.000
[dramatic music]

41:10.030 --> 41:11.170
It's all right.

41:11.200 --> 41:13.190
ERNIE JOHNSON, JR: One of the
most controversial chapters

41:13.220 --> 41:17.010
of his career, there will
be those who say, oh,

41:17.040 --> 41:18.020
how can you do that?

41:18.050 --> 41:19.120
You can't do that to your team.

41:19.150 --> 41:22.000
Basketball is not who he
is, it's what he does.

41:22.030 --> 41:27.220
Who he is the guy who said,
I made my mom a promise.

41:28.010 --> 41:29.180
PLAY-BY-PLAY ANNOUNCER 5: The
Raptors will have a chance

41:29.210 --> 41:32.140
to win it at the buzzer.

41:32.170 --> 41:34.170
The play was drawn up for me
to catch the ball at the top

41:34.200 --> 41:35.230
of the three-point line.

41:36.020 --> 41:37.180
I remember Tyrone
Hill denies that.

41:37.210 --> 41:39.170
PLAY-BY-PLAY ANNOUNCER 5:
Carter trying to get free.

41:39.200 --> 41:41.120
VINCE CARTER: You've gone
through all the repetitions,

41:41.150 --> 41:42.170
and you've prepared for it.

41:42.200 --> 41:44.070
You visualized it.

41:44.100 --> 41:45.170
Now execute it.

41:45.200 --> 41:47.100
PLAY-BY-PLAY ANNOUNCER
5: Carter at the buzzer!

41:47.130 --> 41:50.140
The first half of that shot,
I'm like, oh, this is good.

41:50.170 --> 41:51.130
This is going in.

41:51.160 --> 41:54.190
I think my heart stopped.

41:54.220 --> 41:56.040
You know what I mean?

41:56.070 --> 42:01.000
And it took so long for
the shot to rim out.

42:01.030 --> 42:02.210
So I'm now I'm hoping
for it to hit the back rim,

42:03.000 --> 42:04.060
pop up in the air,
and just fall in.

42:04.090 --> 42:06.080
One of those bounce,
bounce, bounce, go in.

42:06.110 --> 42:08.100
That's what I'm praying for now.

42:08.130 --> 42:10.050
PLAY-BY-PLAY ANNOUNCER 5:
Carter trying to get free.

42:10.080 --> 42:11.120
Carter at the buzzer!

42:11.150 --> 42:12.020
[buzzer]

42:12.050 --> 42:13.010
No good!

42:13.040 --> 42:14.230
The Sixers hold on!

42:15.020 --> 42:18.070
And that's the
Conference Finals!

42:18.100 --> 42:20.190
ALLEN IVERSON: We had
Final aspirations.

42:20.220 --> 42:24.120
And for that shot
right there to go in,

42:24.150 --> 42:26.030
it would have been
heartbreaking.

42:26.060 --> 42:31.100
But you flip the script, and
it had to be heartbreaking

42:31.130 --> 42:33.030
for Vince and his teammates.

42:33.060 --> 42:36.210
Because they got the ball
in the hands of the guy

42:37.000 --> 42:38.050
they wanted it.

42:38.080 --> 42:39.200
You know what I mean?

42:39.230 --> 42:42.010
And those guys, you ask them
now, they live with that.

42:42.040 --> 42:44.010
We want Vince to take that shot.

42:44.040 --> 42:47.000
I think they would
rather had Vince

42:47.030 --> 42:51.080
take that jumper than
someone else having a layup.

42:51.110 --> 42:52.220
[laughs] You know what I mean?

42:53.010 --> 42:55.130
Because they live
and die with Vince.

42:55.160 --> 42:56.190
And rightfully so.

42:56.220 --> 42:59.030
If Vince doesn't
go to graduation--

42:59.060 --> 43:00.110
MAN 3: Right.

43:00.140 --> 43:02.040
--are you guys in
the Conference Final?

43:02.070 --> 43:03.120
No doubt.

43:03.150 --> 43:05.050
That's just ludicrous.

43:05.080 --> 43:09.030
For me, I never had
an issue with that.

43:09.060 --> 43:12.190
I just thought it was a
testament to his character.

43:12.220 --> 43:14.170
He was supposed to
be celebrated for that.

43:14.200 --> 43:17.110
The fact that he did
that shouldn't have

43:17.140 --> 43:20.140
never came up with the loss.

43:20.170 --> 43:22.070
It should have never
even been mentioned.

43:22.100 --> 43:26.000
And for him to do something so
incredible, how can you make

43:26.030 --> 43:28.120
something negative
out of doing something

43:28.150 --> 43:31.040
so great, something
that you wanted to do,

43:31.070 --> 43:35.090
something that you
dreamed about doing

43:35.120 --> 43:38.020
and something so positive?

43:38.050 --> 43:40.190
As we all know, we
make some, we miss some.

43:40.220 --> 43:43.150
But the whole vibe
of that story was

43:43.180 --> 43:46.040
that he wasn't there
for shootaround,

43:46.070 --> 43:48.150
and that's not the reason
why they lost the game.

43:48.180 --> 43:50.230
VINCE CARTER: I
was disappointed.

43:51.020 --> 43:53.090
Let the team down.

43:53.120 --> 43:57.120
Hearing what people had to
say on TV about me going,

43:57.150 --> 44:01.120
about jet lag, about all
of these things that like--

44:01.150 --> 44:03.140
and I'd let that
creep in my mind.

44:03.170 --> 44:06.160
The disappointing thing
outside of all of that,

44:06.190 --> 44:08.150
I felt like I didn't
get enough support.

44:08.180 --> 44:11.030
This is a great time
to show young kids

44:11.060 --> 44:13.130
how important education is.

44:13.160 --> 44:15.230
Student athlete,
not athlete student.

44:16.020 --> 44:20.140
It was a lot to take,
but, with that being said,

44:20.170 --> 44:23.100
I would say
overwhelmed with pride.

44:23.130 --> 44:26.080
Anyone who works that hard
for their college degree

44:26.110 --> 44:27.200
deserves that moment.

44:27.230 --> 44:30.020
When he made that decision
to go to his graduation,

44:30.050 --> 44:32.210
we all was behind him.

44:33.000 --> 44:36.000
Education is so
important, because we

44:36.030 --> 44:39.090
know that your career could
be over within a second.

44:39.120 --> 44:42.210
What was lost in that story
was that he got his degree

44:43.000 --> 44:46.110
from North Carolina, we would
all sign up to get our degree

44:46.140 --> 44:47.140
and then go to work.

44:47.170 --> 44:49.070
And he had that opportunity.

44:49.110 --> 44:51.120
It was just kind of like I
was out there left on an island

44:51.150 --> 44:54.160
by myself, which I was
willing to stand tall for.

44:54.190 --> 44:57.160
Trust in your decision,
stick behind it.

44:57.190 --> 44:58.170
And I did.

44:58.200 --> 45:00.120
And I would do it again.

45:00.150 --> 45:03.110
[dramatic music]

45:08.050 --> 45:10.050
Re-signing there, I remember
talking with my agent,

45:10.080 --> 45:12.080
like, it was a no-brainer.

45:12.110 --> 45:13.080
It's what what I wanted to do.

45:13.110 --> 45:14.180
I was comfortable there.

45:14.210 --> 45:16.030
BUTCH CARTER: I did call
Vince and talk to him

45:16.060 --> 45:18.080
about signing his
extension, because I

45:18.110 --> 45:21.090
wanted him to stay in Toronto.

45:21.120 --> 45:24.020
But they had overplayed him.

45:24.050 --> 45:29.050
That led him to being injured.

45:29.080 --> 45:30.210
VINCE CARTER: Some
injuries you get where

45:31.000 --> 45:33.140
you need surgery immediately.

45:33.170 --> 45:40.040
Some injuries you can wait
some weeks to see if it heals,

45:40.070 --> 45:41.170
and then you kind of
make your decision there.

45:41.200 --> 45:44.030
Well, with the
knee, the ligament--

45:44.060 --> 45:47.180
we waited to see what was what,
I ended up needing surgery.

45:47.210 --> 45:52.070
Those were real
injuries that he suffered.

45:52.100 --> 45:55.120
And he missed the
end of the season.

45:55.150 --> 45:57.180
And the year after
we lost to Philly

45:57.210 --> 46:02.190
in the Conference Semifinals,
he had surgery, I believe.

46:02.220 --> 46:05.120
When I got the
surgery, and my knee

46:05.150 --> 46:07.220
continued to swell and swell
and swell, I was like--

46:08.010 --> 46:10.060
[stammers] --people were like,
man, well, he can't come back.

46:10.090 --> 46:12.070
He just-- I'm like, man,
you all see my knee?

46:12.100 --> 46:15.030
Like, I literally had
a Gatorade bottle.

46:15.060 --> 46:16.230
They had to take all
the fluid out, fill up

46:17.020 --> 46:18.210
an entire Gatorade by the full.

46:19.000 --> 46:22.050
It wasn't done properly,
so I had an infection.

46:22.080 --> 46:23.150
I'm still a young kid.

46:23.180 --> 46:25.120
I'm pissed that I can't
be out there to play.

46:25.150 --> 46:27.070
You're talking about you're
taking basketball from me.

46:27.100 --> 46:29.010
Like, that's all I cared about.

46:29.040 --> 46:30.200
Like, I didn't care
about anything else.

46:30.230 --> 46:35.030
Of course, he was angry
about how he was being treated

46:35.060 --> 46:37.020
and perceived in Toronto,
right, and the things

46:37.050 --> 46:39.150
that the public
were not privy to.

46:39.180 --> 46:41.220
Some errors in
judgment, perhaps.

46:42.010 --> 46:44.120
Like going to a concert while
he's on the injured list

46:44.150 --> 46:46.140
and getting up on stage
and dancing a little bit,

46:46.170 --> 46:50.120
even though dancing a little
bit is not playing basketball.

46:50.150 --> 46:53.000
You know, those sorts
of things sort of

46:53.030 --> 46:54.140
didn't reflect well on Vince.

46:54.170 --> 46:57.080
And I think he got some
backlash for that kind of stuff.

46:57.110 --> 46:58.140
I think he's a bum.

46:58.170 --> 47:00.090
I'm gonna be there to boo him.

47:00.120 --> 47:02.110
And if I could go on the court
and throw a shoulder to him,

47:02.140 --> 47:03.020
I'd do that, too.

47:03.050 --> 47:04.060
Boo!

47:04.090 --> 47:05.070
REPORTER 2: What
do you think of--

47:05.100 --> 47:06.170
Vince, you suck!

47:06.200 --> 47:07.230
REPORTER 2: What do you
think of Vince Carter?

47:08.020 --> 47:09.010
He sucks!

47:09.040 --> 47:10.110
Yeah.

47:10.140 --> 47:12.030
Thanks a lot for all
your hard work, Vince.

47:12.060 --> 47:14.040
It really paid off.

47:14.070 --> 47:17.090
Vince went from
loved to hated.

47:17.120 --> 47:18.200
He was constantly booed.

47:18.230 --> 47:22.180
Raptors fans were
particularly cruel.

47:22.210 --> 47:24.040
GLEN GRUNWALD: That's
just the nature

47:24.070 --> 47:26.130
of being in the public
eye and being a person

47:26.160 --> 47:28.030
that everyone is counting on.

47:28.060 --> 47:32.130
And you have to
understand that people

47:32.160 --> 47:35.090
are going to react to
situations like that

47:35.120 --> 47:37.100
in sort of a negative fashion.

47:37.130 --> 47:40.000
There's this old saying,
like, your best player

47:40.030 --> 47:41.230
has to be your hardest worker.

47:42.020 --> 47:44.030
And Vince didn't
have that reputation.

47:44.060 --> 47:48.060
Vince had a reputation of the
game came really easy to him,

47:48.090 --> 47:51.160
and he would take
the easy way out.

47:51.190 --> 47:55.130
But going from sort
of the Mr. Perfect

47:55.160 --> 47:59.040
to getting some criticism
is a bit of an adjustment.

47:59.070 --> 48:03.040
And particularly when you
feel like you are hurt,

48:03.070 --> 48:05.080
and you're doing your best
you can, and you're trying

48:05.110 --> 48:06.140
to play through some pain.

48:06.170 --> 48:08.060
If you haven't
played this game,

48:08.090 --> 48:10.170
you don't know
what we go through.

48:10.200 --> 48:13.000
You don't know the
bumps and bruises

48:13.030 --> 48:17.020
and the punishment we take,
I mean, especially back then.

48:17.050 --> 48:19.070
You know, so they
don't really understand

48:19.100 --> 48:20.170
what a guy goes through.

48:20.200 --> 48:22.180
So, if a guy is hurt,
and a guy like Vince

48:22.210 --> 48:24.190
I know who loves
to play the game,

48:24.220 --> 48:26.130
I mean, he's not
faking an injury,

48:26.160 --> 48:29.020
or he's not trying to
get out of not playing.

48:29.050 --> 48:30.110
You know?

48:30.140 --> 48:32.030
He wants to be out there
as much as anybody.

48:32.060 --> 48:34.110
But a lot of times, the
people, they want to judge

48:34.140 --> 48:36.180
your character, your heart.

48:36.210 --> 48:39.200
And that young man
has a big heart.

48:39.230 --> 48:44.040
It was unfortunate that it
played out to where it was

48:44.070 --> 48:46.220
saying that he was quitting.

48:47.010 --> 48:49.090
I think one thing
I read in the media

48:49.120 --> 48:51.200
was he didn't give it 100%.

48:51.230 --> 48:54.040
If they just took
just a moment and took

48:54.070 --> 48:57.010
a step back and just got
to know the real Vince,

48:57.040 --> 48:59.000
they would know how he is.

48:59.030 --> 49:00.170
They would know
that he always gives

49:00.200 --> 49:05.140
his all in everything that
he does on and off the court.

49:05.170 --> 49:10.050
Question my love for the
game is the one that pissed

49:10.080 --> 49:12.070
me off more than anything.

49:12.100 --> 49:18.110
Being questioned for something
you love to do was tough for me

49:18.140 --> 49:19.160
to deal with.

49:19.190 --> 49:22.180
[electronic music]

49:33.010 --> 49:36.050
As things started to change,
we get Chris Bosh in now,

49:36.080 --> 49:37.200
and kind of the
franchise wants to move

49:37.230 --> 49:39.080
in a different direction.

49:39.110 --> 49:42.030
You can feel the shift in
the interests of-- when

49:42.060 --> 49:43.100
I say "interests,"
of who they wanted

49:43.130 --> 49:45.000
to be their franchise guy.

49:45.030 --> 49:48.060
When it came
down to that draft,

49:48.090 --> 49:50.060
we needed another big guy.

49:50.090 --> 49:54.000
And so I thought Chris
would be, again, a good

49:54.030 --> 49:59.090
complement to Vince and add
some talent to our squad.

49:59.120 --> 50:02.130
The structure was
extremely poor in Toronto.

50:02.160 --> 50:05.120
And, at the end of the
day, it didn't work.

50:05.150 --> 50:08.120
[electronic music]

50:10.210 --> 50:13.200
VINCE CARTER: As Glen Grunwald's
time came to an end right

50:13.230 --> 50:16.050
at the end of the season, I
remember having a conversation

50:16.080 --> 50:17.220
with the organization,
like, hey, we're

50:18.010 --> 50:19.060
gonna be looking for a new GM.

50:19.090 --> 50:22.110
If you got anybody
in mind, let us know,

50:22.140 --> 50:24.050
and we'll go from there.

50:24.080 --> 50:27.090
JULIUS ERVING: The request came
through their front office.

50:27.120 --> 50:30.100
I know Vince had something
to do with it, just

50:30.130 --> 50:37.050
in terms of the ownership
or the management,

50:37.080 --> 50:42.020
wanting to get the opinion
of their best player.

50:42.050 --> 50:48.070
They invited me up, and
when I went to Toronto--

50:48.100 --> 50:50.190
[laughs] --I was
met at the airport.

50:50.220 --> 50:55.020
He didn't really get to go
into the facility and tour--

50:55.050 --> 50:57.090
as the process should go.

50:57.120 --> 51:00.050
They didn't appreciate
the different cultures

51:00.080 --> 51:01.230
between basketball and hockey.

51:02.020 --> 51:09.150
In hockey, they view players as
more employees, versus the NBA,

51:09.180 --> 51:13.040
I think it's a players' league,
or it's a partnership, I think.

51:13.070 --> 51:18.030
They felt that Vince
became too big for--

51:18.060 --> 51:21.140
his role was, he's
still just a player.

51:21.170 --> 51:26.050
And I think by not necessarily
doing all he wanted to do,

51:26.080 --> 51:29.000
in terms of the GM search,
was sort of the first step.

51:29.030 --> 51:30.090
I just want to play.

51:30.120 --> 51:34.030
And if you don't want
me here, move me on,

51:34.060 --> 51:35.040
and I'll get out of your way.

51:35.070 --> 51:36.030
I don't want to be in your way.

51:36.060 --> 51:37.160
I just want to play.

51:37.190 --> 51:40.010
I just recall having a
conversation with the coach

51:40.040 --> 51:41.150
at the time, Sam
Mitchell, and I told him,

51:41.180 --> 51:43.010
I don't want to leave.

51:43.040 --> 51:45.140
It was all directed at
me and demanding to be--

51:45.170 --> 51:50.040
I'm like-- I had this
conversation with him.

51:50.070 --> 51:52.160
You hear about
trade possibilities,

51:52.190 --> 51:54.100
and, obviously, my
agent gives me calls,

51:54.130 --> 51:56.210
and he has updates because
he was talking with the GM.

51:57.000 --> 51:58.060
I wasn't involved.

51:58.090 --> 52:00.020
And I don't have any
real inside information.

52:00.050 --> 52:04.060
I remember I couldn't
believe the trade they made.

52:04.090 --> 52:06.010
[laughs]

52:06.040 --> 52:08.000
You got a GM to
trade Vince Carter

52:08.030 --> 52:10.040
for a cold six pack of beer.

52:10.070 --> 52:12.060
And I remember
the day it happened.

52:12.090 --> 52:13.190
We're in Indiana.

52:13.220 --> 52:19.140
Wake up to like 70-plus
text messages, a whole bunch

52:19.170 --> 52:20.140
of missed phone calls.

52:20.170 --> 52:22.010
I'm like, what is going on?

52:22.040 --> 52:23.230
Your heart drops,
and you're like,

52:24.020 --> 52:26.170
all right, so what happens now?

52:26.200 --> 52:27.230
And I remember
asking Jalen, I was

52:28.020 --> 52:29.080
like, OK, what happens next?

52:29.110 --> 52:31.060
He's like, well, you
know, you kind of--

52:31.090 --> 52:33.190
[laughs] --he said, you
kind of get your shit

52:33.220 --> 52:35.180
and go onto the next team.

52:35.210 --> 52:40.010
I never felt like I
had the power to say--

52:40.040 --> 52:43.150
to dictate what I could do,
because they're the boss.

52:43.180 --> 52:46.170
[electronic music]

52:55.120 --> 52:57.150
JULIUS ERVING: What
was your first reaction

52:57.180 --> 53:00.070
when you found out that
now I'm going to the Nets?

53:00.100 --> 53:01.180
Well, first of all,
I couldn't believe it.

53:01.210 --> 53:03.030
I thought it was a joke.

53:03.060 --> 53:04.030
You know, I thought
my family was playing

53:04.060 --> 53:05.100
a joke on me and everything.

53:05.130 --> 53:06.220
And once it was a
reality, you know,

53:07.010 --> 53:10.100
you just start thinking,
OK, what do we have

53:10.130 --> 53:11.170
and how can I fit in?

53:11.200 --> 53:13.020
The first thing you
think of is Jason

53:13.050 --> 53:15.100
Kidd and Richard Jefferson.

53:15.130 --> 53:18.090
When we get Vince, I'm
all excited in the summer,

53:18.120 --> 53:20.160
because now I'm like, oh,
we got a chance to win.

53:20.190 --> 53:22.120
VINCE CARTER: When you're
traded to a new team,

53:22.150 --> 53:24.200
you have new energy
and new life.

53:24.230 --> 53:28.170
That's just naturally.

53:28.200 --> 53:31.070
I thought we really had a
chance to be successful and win

53:31.100 --> 53:33.110
the East and give the
Western Conference

53:33.140 --> 53:34.200
a run for their money.

53:34.230 --> 53:36.140
I mean, that was an
incredible time watching

53:36.170 --> 53:37.220
Vince play in New Jersey.

53:38.010 --> 53:40.080
He had RJ, like,
running the right,

53:40.110 --> 53:42.160
he had Vince running the left,
and J-Kidd was down the middle

53:42.190 --> 53:45.070
just picking and choosing who
he wanted to throw lobs to.

53:45.100 --> 53:48.050
To get to play with a team--

53:48.080 --> 53:52.000
an up-and-down fast team, play
with a guy like Jason Kidd,

53:52.030 --> 53:55.070
he made the game easy.

53:55.100 --> 53:58.060
JASON KIDD: He was trying
to feel his way to fit in.

53:58.090 --> 54:01.090
And I told him, look, you
fit in the day we got you.

54:01.120 --> 54:03.180
You just have to be you
and do what you do best,

54:03.210 --> 54:06.000
and I'll make sure
I get you the ball.

54:06.030 --> 54:07.000
IAN EAGLE: :03 seconds left.

54:07.030 --> 54:07.210
Carter with :02 seconds.

54:08.000 --> 54:09.130
Carter for the win--

54:09.160 --> 54:10.190
got it!

54:10.220 --> 54:12.190
Vince Carter has done it!

54:12.220 --> 54:14.130
PLAY-BY-PLAY ANNOUNCER 6:
They've been on the floor,

54:14.160 --> 54:16.060
the Nets have.

54:16.090 --> 54:18.020
Warming up, the reaction has
not been good for Vince Carter.

54:18.050 --> 54:19.110
Why?

54:19.140 --> 54:20.170
PLAY-BY-PLAY ANNOUNCER
7: He flat-out told

54:20.200 --> 54:21.180
the fans he didn't
try or didn't give

54:21.210 --> 54:22.170
it his best when he was here.

54:22.200 --> 54:24.000
So, yes, they are bitter.

54:24.030 --> 54:25.150
TIFFANY SHOLTZ: The
first game that he

54:25.180 --> 54:28.170
returned back to Toronto
was very interesting.

54:28.200 --> 54:30.090
I was kind of nervous.

54:30.120 --> 54:32.030
PA ANNOUNCER 2: From North
Carolina, 6'6" guard,

54:32.060 --> 54:33.230
number 15, Vince Carter.

54:34.020 --> 54:36.060
[loud boos]

54:36.090 --> 54:42.000
The booing was the
worst I've ever heard

54:42.030 --> 54:46.150
in any sport in my entire life.

54:46.180 --> 54:47.120
He was hurt.

54:47.150 --> 54:48.130
I mean, who wouldn't be?

54:48.160 --> 54:53.110
What human being would not be?

54:53.140 --> 54:57.080
But he gave it
everything he had.

54:57.110 --> 55:01.030
That's how you go on,
and you do what you

55:01.060 --> 55:04.080
did for the New Jersey Nets.

55:04.110 --> 55:06.060
VINCE CARTER: Like, I was
able to take off to next level

55:06.090 --> 55:11.140
and just learn how to score
in many different ways on top

55:11.170 --> 55:16.020
of the abilities I had
coming in to New Jersey,

55:16.050 --> 55:18.230
so it was just awesome.

55:19.020 --> 55:22.000
[dramatic electronic music]

55:28.170 --> 55:33.030
I was traded from New Jersey
to Orlando in the off-season

55:33.060 --> 55:35.010
during my basketball camp.

55:35.040 --> 55:37.200
I was hosting a
basketball camp in Orlando

55:37.230 --> 55:40.230
and have all my kids
in there, and I just

55:41.020 --> 55:44.100
got finished doing a drill
with every kid in the camp, one

55:44.130 --> 55:46.100
on one, all that.

55:46.130 --> 55:47.140
Tired, and this
guy was like, yeah,

55:47.170 --> 55:48.130
your brother's on the phone.

55:48.160 --> 55:49.200
Your brother's calling.

55:49.230 --> 55:51.050
So I guess he called
the camp director.

55:51.080 --> 55:52.180
I can't remember who
he handed me the phone.

55:52.210 --> 55:56.070
And he's like, bro, you
heard what's going on?

55:56.100 --> 55:57.060
I'm doing a camp.

55:57.090 --> 55:58.150
What's going on?

55:58.180 --> 56:00.220
He's like, you just
got traded to Orlando.

56:01.010 --> 56:02.080
That was a shock
for me, you know.

56:02.110 --> 56:03.100
They said, you got traded.

56:03.130 --> 56:04.070
I was like, OK, great.

56:04.100 --> 56:05.210
And I said, OK, where?

56:06.000 --> 56:07.020
And he told me back home.

56:07.050 --> 56:09.210
It's just-- it's
a dream come true.

56:10.000 --> 56:12.170
Vince had an opportunity to
go to a team that was a playoff

56:12.200 --> 56:16.140
team in Orlando that was
competing at a very high level,

56:16.170 --> 56:20.190
and I thought he fit right into
what they were trying to do.

56:20.220 --> 56:22.090
He was a piece that could help.

56:22.120 --> 56:26.150
Once he got to Orlando,
that's when the focus became let

56:26.180 --> 56:31.160
me rely on creating
space jump-shooting,

56:31.190 --> 56:33.080
distributing the ball.

56:33.110 --> 56:35.180
Because everything was built
to go through Dwight Howard.

56:35.210 --> 56:39.120
Here's the other thing,
he came to a team that got

56:39.150 --> 56:41.000
to the Finals the year prior.

56:41.030 --> 56:42.140
My most successful
team would definitely

56:42.170 --> 56:44.040
be the Orlando Magic.

56:44.070 --> 56:45.210
Every basketball
player's dream who

56:46.000 --> 56:51.030
steps into the NBA or
any league, your goal

56:51.060 --> 56:52.080
is to win a championship.

56:52.110 --> 56:54.190
It's all about the
right opportunity.

56:54.220 --> 56:57.230
Orlando might have been
the one that I felt,

56:58.020 --> 56:59.200
OK, we still had a chance.

56:59.230 --> 57:02.110
That's when he started to
expand his game a lot more is

57:02.140 --> 57:05.080
when he got to Orlando,
as he stepped out,

57:05.110 --> 57:06.220
started taking more
of a ball-handler

57:07.010 --> 57:10.030
role on, starting knocking
down the long ball a lot.

57:10.060 --> 57:11.210
JASON KIDD: He handled
his role very well

57:12.000 --> 57:13.180
and did it at a very high level.

57:13.210 --> 57:15.110
He can tell you
probably today that he

57:15.140 --> 57:18.130
put his best foot forward
to win a championship

57:18.160 --> 57:20.050
and just came up short.

57:20.080 --> 57:23.120
VINCE CARTER: We lost to
the Boston Celtics in 6.

57:23.150 --> 57:26.070
And they ended up playing the
Lakers in the Finals again.

57:26.100 --> 57:30.180
So it was just--

57:30.210 --> 57:32.200
that's when I was
like, uh, I might

57:32.230 --> 57:34.170
have missed my opportunity.

57:37.080 --> 57:40.230
Have we seen the best already
that Vince Carter has to offer?

57:41.020 --> 57:42.210
I'll tell you the biggest
problem with Vince Carter.

57:43.000 --> 57:44.110
He's a nice guy.

57:44.140 --> 57:47.080
I never met a great
player who wasn't

57:47.110 --> 57:51.160
a bit of a gruff, who would
slap his mama to get a rebound.

57:51.190 --> 57:53.180
Is he competitive enough?

57:53.210 --> 57:55.190
He's just a guy with
a ton of talent.

57:55.220 --> 57:57.050
He has not pushed himself.

57:57.080 --> 57:59.070
Like I say, I just
think, personally,

57:59.100 --> 58:00.220
he's just too nice of a guy.

58:01.010 --> 58:02.050
He doesn't have that edge.

58:04.100 --> 58:06.050
VINCE CARTER: I got so many
of them I should try to wear.

58:06.080 --> 58:08.030
These ones I should try to wear.

58:08.060 --> 58:10.100
I'll think about it.

58:10.130 --> 58:11.160
I like those shoes.

58:14.190 --> 58:16.200
This was when I was in Jersey.

58:16.230 --> 58:19.110
These are old.

58:19.140 --> 58:24.030
These are my Christmas
edition that I wore.

58:24.060 --> 58:25.060
It's supposed to
be for Christmas.

58:25.090 --> 58:28.020
Magic.

58:28.050 --> 58:31.160
MAN 4: But you got
traded before Christmas?

58:31.190 --> 58:32.070
Once I did.

58:32.100 --> 58:33.120
Yeah.

58:33.150 --> 58:35.050
Yeah, that year.

58:35.080 --> 58:38.160
SPORTSCASTER: We had NBA trade
of the blockbuster variety.

58:38.190 --> 58:40.200
Going to Phoenix, Vince Carter.

58:40.230 --> 58:42.140
MIKE FRATELLO: They kind
of swapped uniforms there.

58:42.170 --> 58:44.040
Money was a consideration.

58:44.070 --> 58:46.140
Expiring contracts
a consideration.

58:46.170 --> 58:47.220
VINCE CARTER: It
came out of the blue.

58:48.010 --> 58:48.150
Out of nowhere.

58:51.090 --> 58:53.220
When it happens, you're always
like, well, our team was good.

58:54.010 --> 58:55.090
It's not like our
team was losing.

58:55.120 --> 58:57.010
For us, in Phoenix,
the year before, we

58:57.040 --> 58:58.080
got to the Conference Finals.

58:58.110 --> 59:00.080
Amar'e leaves.

59:00.110 --> 59:02.140
Some things change
with our team.

59:02.170 --> 59:06.110
And so-- and those
changes weren't working.

59:06.140 --> 59:13.030
And so then it was, OK, what
can we do to fix things?

59:13.060 --> 59:16.070
And we brought Vince
in and Gortat, who

59:16.100 --> 59:18.030
was his teammate in Orlando.

59:18.060 --> 59:19.120
And so there's always--

59:19.150 --> 59:21.020
when it happens, you
hate to see guys leave,

59:21.050 --> 59:23.030
but you're excited
about the possibilities.

59:23.060 --> 59:24.210
VINCE CARTER: Phoenix was
a tough situation, for me,

59:25.000 --> 59:26.150
I think more than
anything, because that's

59:26.180 --> 59:28.070
when my reserve role started.

59:28.100 --> 59:29.190
It was an adjustment.

59:29.220 --> 59:31.160
I think that was, for him,
sort of the first time

59:31.190 --> 59:34.080
now where, like, the
ball's not in his hands.

59:34.110 --> 59:35.170
You know?

59:35.200 --> 59:38.010
I think in Toronto, I
think in New Jersey,

59:38.040 --> 59:41.020
even playing with
Jason Kidd, the ball

59:41.050 --> 59:42.180
was in his hands a lot.

59:42.210 --> 59:45.020
He was in pick and roll, he
was able to do some things.

59:45.050 --> 59:46.210
And now, all of a
sudden, we're in Phoenix,

59:47.000 --> 59:49.040
and the ball is in Steve
Nash's hands a lot.

59:49.070 --> 59:50.120
And rightfully so.

59:50.150 --> 59:51.140
The first game was
kind of the weirdest

59:51.170 --> 59:53.120
and the most awkward for me.

59:53.150 --> 59:57.070
You, as the starter, you've been
a starter for all these years,

59:57.100 --> 1:00:02.020
and to now sit there on
the bench, kind of waiting

1:00:02.050 --> 1:00:03.180
your turn, it was different.

1:00:03.210 --> 1:00:06.160
It's a shot to the
ego a little bit.

1:00:06.190 --> 1:00:10.030
You say that you're willing
to do whatever for a team.

1:00:10.060 --> 1:00:11.160
This is putting
that to the test.

1:00:11.190 --> 1:00:13.080
And do you mean what you say?

1:00:13.110 --> 1:00:17.120
A lot of great
players can't adjust

1:00:17.150 --> 1:00:19.210
to playing a different
style of basketball,

1:00:20.000 --> 1:00:22.120
and they can't
deviate from that.

1:00:22.150 --> 1:00:26.170
But I think that's when Vince
started to pivot a little bit.

1:00:26.200 --> 1:00:29.220
I went home that
night, kind of sulked--

1:00:30.010 --> 1:00:32.230
[laughs] --and just
tried to find my way

1:00:33.020 --> 1:00:34.090
and kind of get it together.

1:00:34.120 --> 1:00:35.210
GRANT HILL: I think it
really helped him accept

1:00:36.000 --> 1:00:39.050
and embrace sort of where
he's at and maybe also

1:00:39.080 --> 1:00:40.170
where his future is at.

1:00:40.200 --> 1:00:43.060
And that was the toughest
year out of all of them,

1:00:43.090 --> 1:00:46.040
I think was Phoenix
and just learning

1:00:46.070 --> 1:00:48.120
how to handle that new role.

1:00:48.150 --> 1:00:51.130
I think it really
contributed to his longevity.

1:00:51.160 --> 1:00:54.080
GRANT HILL: I asked
myself this question--

1:00:54.110 --> 1:00:57.110
does starting mean
that much to you,

1:00:57.140 --> 1:01:01.050
or being a closer and a finisher
of a game mean more to you?

1:01:01.080 --> 1:01:03.000
I remember having a
conversation with him,

1:01:03.030 --> 1:01:06.090
talking about this
is interesting to me.

1:01:06.120 --> 1:01:09.080
And whether it was working with
some of the younger players,

1:01:09.110 --> 1:01:11.160
whether it was, oh, that
experience of coming

1:01:11.190 --> 1:01:14.000
in off the bench and sort
of how the game changes,

1:01:14.030 --> 1:01:15.200
and the chemistry
of a basketball game

1:01:15.230 --> 1:01:17.080
changes at that moment.

1:01:17.110 --> 1:01:20.060
And it struck me in the
moment that he was curious

1:01:20.090 --> 1:01:24.050
about other things besides being
the A number one superstar who

1:01:24.080 --> 1:01:27.030
was dunking the ball, and
that if he was intellectually

1:01:27.060 --> 1:01:31.080
curious and excited about
other parts and little folds

1:01:31.110 --> 1:01:35.020
and facet of a game that you can
get from being a role player.

1:01:35.050 --> 1:01:38.020
That, to me, I remember back on
that conversation and thinking,

1:01:38.050 --> 1:01:40.080
oh, this can be interesting.

1:01:40.110 --> 1:01:41.130
And it was.

1:01:41.160 --> 1:01:42.120
If you have an
ego in this league,

1:01:42.150 --> 1:01:44.000
it's going to get checked.

1:01:44.030 --> 1:01:46.140
You know, even the greatest--

1:01:46.170 --> 1:01:48.220
Michael Jordan-- he--

1:01:49.010 --> 1:01:51.060
I mean, his ego
got checked, too.

1:01:51.090 --> 1:01:52.080
He needed people.

1:01:52.110 --> 1:01:53.200
You know what I mean?

1:01:53.230 --> 1:01:55.060
He wasn't going to be
able to do it by himself.

1:01:55.090 --> 1:01:57.150
LeBron had to go find
some people in Miami.

1:01:57.180 --> 1:02:00.070
So, no matter how great you are,
you're always gonna get sick.

1:02:00.100 --> 1:02:02.090
So he did it for himself.

1:02:02.120 --> 1:02:04.160
I hold Vince up
now as an example

1:02:04.190 --> 1:02:07.000
when I have
conversations with guys

1:02:07.030 --> 1:02:08.140
as they get toward the
end of their career

1:02:08.170 --> 1:02:10.220
about what do you want to be.

1:02:11.010 --> 1:02:15.150
And I think Vince did something
so fascinating by deciding,

1:02:15.180 --> 1:02:17.200
what I want to be
is a basketball

1:02:17.230 --> 1:02:20.010
player who plays basketball.

1:02:20.040 --> 1:02:21.220
And that sounds super simple.

1:02:22.010 --> 1:02:24.060
But when you are a decoration
at the end of the bench

1:02:24.090 --> 1:02:26.230
because you are "ring-chasing"
as people like to say,

1:02:27.020 --> 1:02:28.190
if you are going to the team
where you think you have

1:02:28.220 --> 1:02:30.210
the best chance to
win that hardware,

1:02:31.000 --> 1:02:33.070
but you're really mostly
just a "locker room presence"

1:02:33.100 --> 1:02:36.120
or a "practice
player" or something,

1:02:36.150 --> 1:02:38.100
you can do that if
you decide the most

1:02:38.130 --> 1:02:41.230
important thing is I want to
cap off my career with a ring.

1:02:42.020 --> 1:02:43.030
But then you're
not really playing

1:02:43.060 --> 1:02:44.210
basketball in the same way.

1:02:45.000 --> 1:02:47.160
And Vince decided,
I want to play.

1:02:47.190 --> 1:02:50.050
[dramatic music]

1:02:51.220 --> 1:02:59.110
VINCE CARTER Obviously I enjoy
playing and being a starter

1:02:59.140 --> 1:03:00.190
is whatever.

1:03:00.220 --> 1:03:04.100
I just wanted to finish
games if possible.

1:03:04.130 --> 1:03:06.050
And I still got a
chance to finish games.

1:03:09.180 --> 1:03:18.010
At that time, it's just had to
accept it and learn how to deal

1:03:18.040 --> 1:03:20.210
with it and it's tough
for a lot of guys

1:03:21.000 --> 1:03:25.080
to do that and understand, like,
when you played a starring role

1:03:25.110 --> 1:03:28.160
for so long, and
then now you're asked

1:03:28.190 --> 1:03:30.140
to play a reserve role,
which you're not used

1:03:30.170 --> 1:03:34.160
to, being able to handle it.

1:03:34.190 --> 1:03:38.090
I feel like I took
it like a champ.

1:03:38.120 --> 1:03:46.000
I did some studying to figure
out how to be consistent at it.

1:03:46.030 --> 1:03:48.130
And it kept me around
for another 10 years.

1:03:48.160 --> 1:03:54.020
I started I started getting into
on the YouTube and watching,

1:03:54.050 --> 1:03:58.190
like, Ginobili, Vinnie Johnson,
some of the great sixth men

1:03:58.220 --> 1:04:02.000
in NBA history and
learn from them

1:04:02.030 --> 1:04:07.030
and try to incorporate my style
of play, who I am, into that.

1:04:07.060 --> 1:04:07.210
And here I am.

1:04:12.180 --> 1:04:15.170
[inspirational music]

1:04:27.230 --> 1:04:29.090
Just give me your
initial reaction

1:04:29.120 --> 1:04:31.040
to now being a part
of the defending World

1:04:31.070 --> 1:04:32.100
Champion Dallas Mavericks.

1:04:32.130 --> 1:04:33.180
I mean, what can you say?

1:04:33.210 --> 1:04:35.220
They've accomplished
the ultimate goal,

1:04:36.010 --> 1:04:38.020
and the next thing I
know, I'm getting a phone

1:04:38.050 --> 1:04:40.200
call from the Mavericks staff.

1:04:40.230 --> 1:04:42.110
Wow, we get a chance
to convince Carter?

1:04:42.140 --> 1:04:45.140
[laughs] I mean, we
definitely got to do that.

1:04:45.170 --> 1:04:47.080
You know, he came
to us from Phoenix,

1:04:47.110 --> 1:04:49.050
where he didn't have
much of a role anymore,

1:04:49.080 --> 1:04:52.080
and everybody was kind of
saying he was phasing out.

1:04:52.110 --> 1:04:54.150
But I think he was
kind of holding back.

1:04:54.180 --> 1:04:59.070
Vince came to me and asked if
he could be our new sixth man.

1:04:59.100 --> 1:05:03.100
The vast majority of
NBA players are not

1:05:03.130 --> 1:05:08.010
going to knock on your
door and say, hey, coach,

1:05:08.040 --> 1:05:09.160
can I come off the bench?

1:05:09.190 --> 1:05:12.040
And that's-- generally,
that's not the dream.

1:05:12.070 --> 1:05:16.090
He was phenomenal, and
you don't often, if ever,

1:05:16.120 --> 1:05:18.200
get a guy like Vince who
had been in the league

1:05:18.230 --> 1:05:22.000
a long time at that point but
had only been with us one year.

1:05:22.030 --> 1:05:24.050
The guy was pure class here.

1:05:26.200 --> 1:05:29.030
He knew a bigger role
was coming for him.

1:05:29.060 --> 1:05:32.120
He came off the bench, and it
was an instant offense for us.

1:05:32.150 --> 1:05:34.210
He not only wanted
to help the team,

1:05:35.000 --> 1:05:36.230
but he wanted to
challenge himself.

1:05:37.020 --> 1:05:39.220
And you know, the
things that you actually

1:05:40.010 --> 1:05:43.080
have to do to go from
being perennial all-star

1:05:43.110 --> 1:05:45.170
and a starter to
being a sixth man,

1:05:45.200 --> 1:05:48.010
you've got to reprogram
how you think a little bit.

1:05:48.040 --> 1:05:51.130
And I'll tell you,
Vince was as good

1:05:51.160 --> 1:05:53.050
a sixth man as I've ever seen.

1:05:53.080 --> 1:05:55.230
It's the evolution of
a guy embracing his role.

1:05:56.020 --> 1:05:59.080
You could be a sixth man, but
you can play starters minutes.

1:05:59.110 --> 1:06:02.180
You know, if you're playing
upwards of 30 minutes a game,

1:06:02.210 --> 1:06:05.140
does it really
matter if he started?

1:06:05.170 --> 1:06:10.060
Vince was not only an athletic
player, but he was clutch.

1:06:10.090 --> 1:06:13.090
In 2014, you know,
we're playing the Spurs,

1:06:13.120 --> 1:06:15.160
and Dallas, San Antonio
is a big rivalry.

1:06:15.190 --> 1:06:18.050
That play that we ran
against the San Antonio Spurs

1:06:18.080 --> 1:06:21.000
that night, we've run
100 times probably,

1:06:21.030 --> 1:06:22.190
and it never really worked.

1:06:22.220 --> 1:06:25.020
Right before we
were walking out,

1:06:25.050 --> 1:06:27.140
Coach Carlisle comes to me.

1:06:27.170 --> 1:06:30.140
He's like, hey, you
might get this ball.

1:06:30.170 --> 1:06:31.200
Be ready.

1:06:31.230 --> 1:06:34.100
We're down 2 with
1.5 seconds left,

1:06:34.130 --> 1:06:38.020
and we had a play that we
had worked on where Vince

1:06:38.050 --> 1:06:40.020
would peel off to the corner.

1:06:40.050 --> 1:06:42.010
That's a tough place
to play and to make

1:06:42.040 --> 1:06:43.230
a play with short
time because we've

1:06:44.020 --> 1:06:45.110
got to turn around all the way.

1:06:45.140 --> 1:06:49.040
Pump fake just to get
him up, and then shoot it.

1:06:49.070 --> 1:06:50.160
And leave it up there
with confidence.

1:06:50.190 --> 1:06:52.110
ANNOUNCER: He got to the ball.

1:06:52.140 --> 1:06:53.050
[cheering]

1:06:53.080 --> 1:06:53.190
ANNOUNCER: Yes!

1:06:53.220 --> 1:06:55.100
Yes!

1:06:55.130 --> 1:06:57.210
Do you believe it?

1:06:58.000 --> 1:06:58.230
The starter.

1:07:02.100 --> 1:07:07.000
To see that shot
go in was unreal,

1:07:07.030 --> 1:07:09.160
you know, because I
date back to 2001.

1:07:09.190 --> 1:07:11.010
ANNOUNCER: Carter at the buzzer.

1:07:11.040 --> 1:07:11.160
[cheering]

1:07:11.190 --> 1:07:13.160
End game!

1:07:13.190 --> 1:07:16.210
12 years later, I get the
opportunity, again, finally

1:07:17.000 --> 1:07:20.030
to redeem myself for me.

1:07:20.060 --> 1:07:22.080
It was one of the
most exhilarating

1:07:22.110 --> 1:07:24.020
moments I've had as a coach.

1:07:24.050 --> 1:07:26.230
And for him, for him
to have that moment

1:07:27.020 --> 1:07:31.070
in a playoff series like
that, it was just phenomenal.

1:07:31.100 --> 1:07:33.200
It almost seemed like the
tougher the shot, the more easy

1:07:33.230 --> 1:07:38.020
he made it look, and that's
why he's one of the greats.

1:07:47.030 --> 1:07:49.040
Every time I
receive knowledge,

1:07:49.070 --> 1:07:51.150
I was able to incorporate
it into my game

1:07:51.180 --> 1:07:55.170
and could see positive
things happening.

1:07:55.200 --> 1:07:58.100
You know, I had Charles Oakley
who played with Michael Jordan.

1:07:58.130 --> 1:08:01.150
I had Kevin Wilson who played
with Dominique Wilkins.

1:08:01.180 --> 1:08:03.150
I had Dee Brown who
played with Larry Bird.

1:08:03.180 --> 1:08:06.180
I had Doug Christie who
played with Magic Johnson.

1:08:06.210 --> 1:08:09.170
Those are some of the elite
of the elite that has played

1:08:09.200 --> 1:08:11.190
this game that these
guys who have played with

1:08:11.220 --> 1:08:14.190
can share knowledge with
me of how they watch them

1:08:14.220 --> 1:08:16.090
operate on and off the court.

1:08:16.120 --> 1:08:17.190
Just want to come
out here and show some

1:08:17.220 --> 1:08:19.170
of my support for, of
course, the rookies

1:08:19.200 --> 1:08:23.190
that we had last year and
then for the new guys.

1:08:23.220 --> 1:08:26.080
For me, it was a goal to
come out and get myself

1:08:26.110 --> 1:08:29.070
in shape and just, you know,
practice with these guys

1:08:29.100 --> 1:08:31.040
and just give them as
much knowledge as I can.

1:08:31.070 --> 1:08:34.090
If it wasn't for me
playing 20-plus years,

1:08:34.120 --> 1:08:36.150
a lot of coaches wouldn't
allow me to be the player

1:08:36.180 --> 1:08:38.040
coach and have a voice.

1:08:38.070 --> 1:08:40.230
I'm very appreciative
that these young guys--

1:08:41.020 --> 1:08:43.060
you know, obviously,
they view me

1:08:43.090 --> 1:08:45.120
as a teammate like anyone else.

1:08:45.150 --> 1:08:49.160
But they know I've been around,
and they value my knowledge.

1:08:49.190 --> 1:08:53.180
And they allow me
to share and help

1:08:53.210 --> 1:08:55.090
whenever the time is right.

1:08:55.120 --> 1:08:57.010
It was like
having two coaches.

1:08:57.040 --> 1:08:58.140
You know, a lot of times,
when games he wasn't playing,

1:08:58.170 --> 1:09:02.000
you see him up on the
bench, telling guys, really,

1:09:02.030 --> 1:09:03.170
you should be here, be
there, just giving him

1:09:03.200 --> 1:09:06.090
different type of
information, the things

1:09:06.120 --> 1:09:08.060
that they can use to help them.

1:09:08.090 --> 1:09:10.120
He was just trying
to do what he could

1:09:10.150 --> 1:09:14.120
do or give whatever he could
give to help his teammates win.

1:09:14.150 --> 1:09:18.220
This is one of two
things that I'm proud of.

1:09:19.010 --> 1:09:21.100
I won the Twyman-Stokes award.

1:09:21.130 --> 1:09:23.150
So basically, it's the
Teammate of the Year Award,

1:09:23.180 --> 1:09:26.110
and you're voted
by your peers, you

1:09:26.140 --> 1:09:28.050
know, players
around the NBA, not

1:09:28.080 --> 1:09:32.130
just your current team but all
players involved in this award.

1:09:32.160 --> 1:09:38.180
And I won it, and I view this at
the same level, in my opinion,

1:09:38.210 --> 1:09:40.110
as a MVP.

1:09:40.140 --> 1:09:45.020
Vince had just the
humility and the perspective

1:09:45.050 --> 1:09:48.180
and the desire to be in
this game that led him to be

1:09:48.210 --> 1:09:52.000
able to play a role, that led
him to be able to go to Memphis

1:09:52.030 --> 1:09:54.110
or Sacramento or Atlanta.

1:09:54.140 --> 1:09:57.100
He just wanted it to,
you know, not just

1:09:57.130 --> 1:09:59.120
keep his career
going but to do it

1:09:59.150 --> 1:10:01.010
in a way that was meaningful.

1:10:01.040 --> 1:10:03.190
And that's meant
mentoring younger players,

1:10:03.220 --> 1:10:07.140
setting an example in terms
of his daily work ethic,

1:10:07.170 --> 1:10:10.140
passing along what he knows.

1:10:10.170 --> 1:10:13.080
It just speaks to Vince's
generous spirit, I think,

1:10:13.110 --> 1:10:15.120
as a player and as a man.

1:10:15.150 --> 1:10:18.210
There's no player
that I'd rather

1:10:19.000 --> 1:10:22.120
have around all these
young kids today to mentor.

1:10:22.150 --> 1:10:24.130
I think that's the
best thing he can

1:10:24.160 --> 1:10:28.080
do the last few years
because you want

1:10:28.110 --> 1:10:30.040
to emulate him as a player.

1:10:30.070 --> 1:10:33.130
But the main thing, you want
to emulate him as a person.

1:10:33.160 --> 1:10:35.080
There have been a few
times in the last few years

1:10:35.110 --> 1:10:37.200
I thought, well, I wonder
if this is it for Vince?

1:10:37.230 --> 1:10:42.100
And then he still shows
up, and he still hit shots.

1:10:42.130 --> 1:10:45.210
You know, the game has changed,
but, every now and then,

1:10:46.000 --> 1:10:47.210
he'll give you a little glimpse.

1:10:48.000 --> 1:10:50.120
You know, he'll get
up, and we'll go, wow.

1:10:50.150 --> 1:10:53.080
When it comes to the
humility that it takes

1:10:53.110 --> 1:10:57.000
to be a 22-year
player, every year,

1:10:57.030 --> 1:10:58.100
he's playing fewer minutes.

1:10:58.130 --> 1:10:59.170
He's putting up
fewer more points.

1:10:59.200 --> 1:11:01.100
His averages are low.

1:11:01.130 --> 1:11:03.150
It's dragging down his career
averages to the point where

1:11:03.180 --> 1:11:05.060
it's like, oh, well, he
didn't even average 20

1:11:05.090 --> 1:11:06.080
points a game for his career.

1:11:06.110 --> 1:11:07.210
What are we talking about?

1:11:08.000 --> 1:11:10.020
Well, it's because he
tacked on seven, eight, nine

1:11:10.050 --> 1:11:11.120
years at the end
that a lot of guys

1:11:11.150 --> 1:11:13.180
wouldn't have hung out for.

1:11:13.210 --> 1:11:15.120
He didn't care about
his career averages.

1:11:15.150 --> 1:11:19.150
He didn't care what that would
do to some statistical, you

1:11:19.180 --> 1:11:23.070
know, box on a website.

1:11:23.100 --> 1:11:26.130
He understood that there
was another purpose for him

1:11:26.160 --> 1:11:27.200
to stick around this game.

1:11:27.230 --> 1:11:29.010
There was a value to it.

1:11:37.230 --> 1:11:41.030
I worked so hard
to be in shape

1:11:41.060 --> 1:11:43.160
and then play this game to
compete against young guys

1:11:43.190 --> 1:11:50.050
half my age, so I wanted
to go out playing the game.

1:11:50.080 --> 1:11:51.230
I think sitting on
the end of the bench,

1:11:52.020 --> 1:11:55.070
not being able to be
a part of this is--

1:11:55.100 --> 1:11:57.120
you know, that would kill
me more than anything.

1:12:04.200 --> 1:12:07.090
I've obviously been
the same age as Vince

1:12:07.120 --> 1:12:08.210
at the end of his
career and knowing

1:12:09.000 --> 1:12:10.130
it's the end of his career.

1:12:10.160 --> 1:12:14.030
When we first got him the first
year, you know, part of me

1:12:14.060 --> 1:12:16.050
thought that was going
to be his last season

1:12:16.080 --> 1:12:18.070
and what a special
moment it would

1:12:18.100 --> 1:12:21.020
be to have Vince
in his last season

1:12:21.050 --> 1:12:22.120
with a really young team.

1:12:22.150 --> 1:12:24.010
And he understood the role.

1:12:24.040 --> 1:12:26.000
We talked about the role
of leadership and guidance.

1:12:28.180 --> 1:12:30.040
Sure enough, when
the season started,

1:12:30.070 --> 1:12:32.060
he had to start
for us at the four.

1:12:32.090 --> 1:12:38.070
Trey was starting at age 20, I
believe, and Vince was age 41.

1:12:38.100 --> 1:12:41.140
And so that was the biggest
gap, 21 years of age,

1:12:41.170 --> 1:12:46.120
between starters on the starting
lineup, so it just kind of-- it

1:12:46.150 --> 1:12:51.100
showed for me how valuable
Vince was when we brought him in

1:12:51.130 --> 1:12:54.130
but also how special
he is as a player

1:12:54.160 --> 1:12:57.010
to still be able to
play, still be able to be

1:12:57.040 --> 1:12:58.110
included as a starter.

1:12:58.140 --> 1:13:00.120
Vince has been in the
league 20-plus years.

1:13:00.150 --> 1:13:02.130
He's past that vet point.

1:13:02.160 --> 1:13:04.070
He's a OG.

1:13:04.100 --> 1:13:07.130
Everything he says, it's like,
you know, he's been through it.

1:13:07.160 --> 1:13:10.060
Like, you listen to the OGs.

1:13:10.090 --> 1:13:12.230
You want to be in their
shoes because he's talking

1:13:13.020 --> 1:13:14.070
just as much as the coaches.

1:13:14.100 --> 1:13:15.170
Vince is always
the first one--

1:13:15.200 --> 1:13:18.120
especially on our home
games, he's always

1:13:18.150 --> 1:13:19.210
the first one on the court.

1:13:20.000 --> 1:13:21.080
He's always the first one.

1:13:21.110 --> 1:13:23.010
His routine, his vitamin,
his shooting routine

1:13:23.040 --> 1:13:26.030
is he's always the first guy
before the young guys go.

1:13:26.060 --> 1:13:27.210
The Toronto Raptors
were in the NBA Finals

1:13:28.000 --> 1:13:31.020
the year before Vince retired,
and he has been a guest analyst

1:13:31.050 --> 1:13:33.100
on the Jump on our
show for the playoffs

1:13:33.130 --> 1:13:35.050
for the previous five years.

1:13:35.080 --> 1:13:37.220
So we've had him at all
of these NBA Finals sites

1:13:38.010 --> 1:13:41.080
through the years, and this time
the NBA Finals were in Toronto.

1:13:41.110 --> 1:13:43.220
And there was some question
about, was he going to come up?

1:13:44.010 --> 1:13:45.160
There has been some
back and forth with him

1:13:45.190 --> 1:13:48.110
and the Toronto fan base over
the years at different times.

1:13:48.140 --> 1:13:51.230
But to Vince's credit,
he was all in to come,

1:13:52.020 --> 1:13:56.220
and we had him on a stage
outside in that Jurassic park

1:13:57.010 --> 1:14:00.060
fan area with him,
myself, and Tracy McGrady.

1:14:00.090 --> 1:14:01.070
This is dedication out here.

1:14:01.100 --> 1:14:02.080
I mean, it's raining.

1:14:02.110 --> 1:14:03.050
Yeah, it's not warm.

1:14:03.080 --> 1:14:03.230
It's a little chilly.

1:14:04.020 --> 1:14:05.150
Exactly.

1:14:05.180 --> 1:14:08.180
But there out here because
they want to witness history.

1:14:08.210 --> 1:14:10.120
And to have him
have that moment

1:14:10.150 --> 1:14:13.210
with the screaming
Toronto fans in the rain,

1:14:14.000 --> 1:14:15.200
it was crazy out there.

1:14:15.230 --> 1:14:18.150
It felt very special to me
that, even though he didn't get

1:14:18.180 --> 1:14:21.110
that final lap
playing in Toronto,

1:14:21.140 --> 1:14:23.050
that he was there
with the people.

1:14:23.080 --> 1:14:26.160
I almost think that that was a
better moment, at least for me,

1:14:26.190 --> 1:14:28.130
as someone who watched
him throughout his career,

1:14:28.160 --> 1:14:30.200
to see him connect with
everybody in that way

1:14:30.230 --> 1:14:32.180
and especially to
be there with T-Mac

1:14:32.210 --> 1:14:36.010
felt like really just
everything came full circle.

1:14:36.040 --> 1:14:36.210
"He hates Toronto.

1:14:37.000 --> 1:14:38.100
He had no luck."

1:14:38.130 --> 1:14:40.200
So far from the truth,
so far from the truth.

1:14:40.230 --> 1:14:44.010
I still have
business in Toronto,

1:14:44.040 --> 1:14:49.000
so not wanting to be there
and didn't appreciate my time?

1:14:49.030 --> 1:14:51.090
Never, never.

1:14:51.120 --> 1:14:52.230
Definitely appreciate it.

1:14:53.020 --> 1:14:54.110
I still appreciate some of
the people that are there.

1:14:54.140 --> 1:14:58.060
Still talk to him to this
day, in the organization

1:14:58.090 --> 1:14:59.110
and around the city.

1:15:11.160 --> 1:15:13.050
That's a big point
of conversation

1:15:13.080 --> 1:15:14.210
that day is, you know, what's
going on with the league?

1:15:15.000 --> 1:15:17.040
What's going on with the virus?

1:15:17.070 --> 1:15:18.090
What's next?

1:15:18.120 --> 1:15:20.020
The owners,
organization in general,

1:15:20.050 --> 1:15:22.120
we're all in the locker room,
talking about the scenarios.

1:15:22.150 --> 1:15:26.040
If this happens, if
somebody tests positive,

1:15:26.070 --> 1:15:27.120
what would happen?

1:15:27.150 --> 1:15:28.120
We're leaving the
locker room, and we're

1:15:28.150 --> 1:15:30.120
about to break the huddle.

1:15:30.150 --> 1:15:33.030
And I said, hey,
you know, this could

1:15:33.060 --> 1:15:35.060
be our last game without fans.

1:15:35.090 --> 1:15:36.140
That was my message.

1:15:36.170 --> 1:15:38.180
This could be our last
game without fans.

1:15:38.210 --> 1:15:43.160
And Dewayne Dedmon, without
missing a beat, says,

1:15:43.190 --> 1:15:46.230
this could be Vince's
last game without fans.

1:15:47.020 --> 1:15:51.040
We're coming out to halftime
to shoot, and OP comes up to us

1:15:51.070 --> 1:15:53.170
and just tells us,
tells me and Vince,

1:15:53.200 --> 1:15:56.000
that the season's
probably get canceled,

1:15:56.030 --> 1:15:59.210
that the Thunder and the
Jags game just got canceled.

1:16:00.020 --> 1:16:02.060
Coach Pierce says,
you heard about what

1:16:02.090 --> 1:16:03.110
happened to Rudy Gobert?

1:16:03.140 --> 1:16:05.040
He's like, he tested positive.

1:16:05.070 --> 1:16:07.020
And now we know
something's going on,

1:16:07.050 --> 1:16:09.130
and we understand, this
is probably it for us.

1:16:09.160 --> 1:16:12.140
We still have a second
half to play, try to get back

1:16:12.170 --> 1:16:13.180
in this game, get us a win.

1:16:13.210 --> 1:16:15.150
We're still focused
on the game, so,

1:16:15.180 --> 1:16:17.210
like, we're so far
behind we don't

1:16:18.000 --> 1:16:20.080
even understand what
the world's talking

1:16:20.110 --> 1:16:22.080
about and going through.

1:16:22.110 --> 1:16:24.140
And it'd get to about the
fourth quarter, midway

1:16:24.170 --> 1:16:27.150
in the fourth quarter, Dewayne
Dedmon leans over to me,

1:16:27.180 --> 1:16:31.090
and he's like, you know this
might be your last game?

1:16:31.120 --> 1:16:33.110
Damn, you know what?

1:16:33.140 --> 1:16:35.090
This might, like--
this might be it.

1:16:35.120 --> 1:16:37.070
Fans are starting to
chant, like, we want Vince.

1:16:37.100 --> 1:16:38.040
We want Vince.

1:16:38.070 --> 1:16:39.050
CROWD: We want Vince!

1:16:39.080 --> 1:16:40.170
We want Vince!

1:16:40.200 --> 1:16:42.210
We just started hearing,
"Vince, Vince, Vince,"

1:16:43.000 --> 1:16:44.120
from the fans.

1:16:44.150 --> 1:16:46.130
And everyone's chanting to
get Vince back in the game.

1:16:46.160 --> 1:16:48.010
It hasn't even crossed my mind.

1:16:48.040 --> 1:16:49.160
DeAndre was like,
ah, we want Vince.

1:16:49.190 --> 1:16:50.130
Like, Oh, hey, Vince.

1:16:50.160 --> 1:16:51.200
Sit down.

1:16:51.230 --> 1:16:52.190
Chill out.

1:16:52.220 --> 1:16:53.230
Let's get this over with.

1:16:54.020 --> 1:16:55.050
I don't think he
wanted to go in.

1:16:55.080 --> 1:16:58.050
I think the crowd
chanting, "We want

1:16:58.080 --> 1:17:01.120
Vince," kind of
persuaded the whole Vince

1:17:01.150 --> 1:17:03.080
and LP to put him in.

1:17:03.110 --> 1:17:08.070
And made eye contact with
LP, and he looked at me.

1:17:08.100 --> 1:17:10.060
And I turned, and
I look at the bench.

1:17:10.090 --> 1:17:13.030
I look down at the bench,
and all of the guys

1:17:13.060 --> 1:17:16.180
are basically tugging at
and pointing that Vince

1:17:16.210 --> 1:17:18.090
and telling him to get up.

1:17:18.120 --> 1:17:20.170
But he looked at me, and
he was kind of like, go in.

1:17:20.200 --> 1:17:22.090
And it's just like--

1:17:22.120 --> 1:17:26.060
everything changed that
fast in an instant.

1:17:26.090 --> 1:17:27.150
[crowd]

1:17:27.180 --> 1:17:29.230
ANNOUNCER: And they're
going to put him in.

1:17:30.020 --> 1:17:32.130
From that point, it was just
kind of like, what's going on?

1:17:32.160 --> 1:17:33.220
Like, this might be it.

1:17:34.010 --> 1:17:36.120
For me, a lot of things
ran through my mind.

1:17:36.150 --> 1:17:38.000
I mean, I was thinking
about my season

1:17:38.030 --> 1:17:39.230
being over with
at the same time.

1:17:40.020 --> 1:17:42.060
I had a guy right
to my next to me

1:17:42.090 --> 1:17:46.130
that this could be the last
time ever playing an NBA game.

1:17:46.160 --> 1:17:49.020
And then I remember Trey said,
hey, we're going to get you--

1:17:49.050 --> 1:17:50.130
you're going to
take the last shot.

1:17:50.160 --> 1:17:51.200
I'm like, all right,
cool, whatever, whatever,

1:17:51.230 --> 1:17:53.020
because I'm still processing.

1:17:53.050 --> 1:17:54.110
And I hear them,
and I understand it.

1:17:54.140 --> 1:17:56.030
But I was like, all
right, cool, whatever.

1:17:56.060 --> 1:17:58.090
New York kind of knows we're
running the shot for Vince

1:17:58.120 --> 1:18:01.090
anyways, but, in
the event that they

1:18:01.120 --> 1:18:02.180
didn't, we had something there.

1:18:02.210 --> 1:18:04.070
And Trey did exactly that.

1:18:04.100 --> 1:18:05.120
He drove it.

1:18:05.150 --> 1:18:06.130
Three guys collapsed
on him, and he

1:18:06.160 --> 1:18:08.070
just pitched it back to Vince.

1:18:08.100 --> 1:18:11.100
And in a classic Vince moment,
he steps right in off the bench

1:18:11.130 --> 1:18:15.050
and played the last 15
minutes, and he drains the 3.

1:18:16.170 --> 1:18:17.080
ANNOUNCER: And that's
what they're going to do.

1:18:17.110 --> 1:18:18.010
Carter for 3.

1:18:18.040 --> 1:18:18.160
Get in there.

1:18:18.190 --> 1:18:21.040
[cheering]

1:18:21.070 --> 1:18:22.160
ANNOUNCER: Unbelievable.

1:18:22.190 --> 1:18:26.150
What an appropriate
play to finish

1:18:26.180 --> 1:18:28.190
for the great Vince Carter.

1:18:28.220 --> 1:18:33.040
Thankfully it went in, and
it was just a great moment.

1:18:33.070 --> 1:18:36.010
You know, and I was able to walk
off, and it was kind of like,

1:18:36.040 --> 1:18:36.230
all right.

1:18:37.020 --> 1:18:38.070
I made the last shot.

1:18:38.100 --> 1:18:42.060
So the ending is
there if need be.

1:18:42.090 --> 1:18:43.190
It was a crazy moment.

1:18:43.220 --> 1:18:46.010
I was-- I'm going to be
able to tell my kids someday

1:18:46.040 --> 1:18:48.130
that I gave Vince Carter
his last bucket in NBA,

1:18:48.160 --> 1:18:51.100
so that's something
I'll never forget.

1:18:51.130 --> 1:18:54.000
But I thought it was a great
moment, not only for him.

1:18:54.030 --> 1:18:58.120
Who knew at the time that that
would really be his last game,

1:18:58.150 --> 1:19:00.220
but what a great
ending to a career

1:19:01.010 --> 1:19:02.230
and what a great
moment for the fans.

1:19:03.020 --> 1:19:04.160
And I think the
reason that moment

1:19:04.190 --> 1:19:06.170
struck such a
chord with everyone

1:19:06.200 --> 1:19:08.130
was it was completely organic.

1:19:08.160 --> 1:19:11.150
It wasn't some big hoopla
organized celebration.

1:19:11.180 --> 1:19:13.150
It was just the people
in that building

1:19:13.180 --> 1:19:17.070
who knew how important
Vince Carter was to the game

1:19:17.100 --> 1:19:20.090
and that this moment
must be respected

1:19:20.120 --> 1:19:21.230
and that being just natural.

1:19:39.090 --> 1:19:41.220
It feels like I've been
retired for about a year

1:19:42.010 --> 1:19:49.210
or so because of my internal
clock and how things have

1:19:50.000 --> 1:19:52.220
operated for 20-plus years.

1:19:53.010 --> 1:19:54.180
Most guys, you
can put markers.

1:19:54.210 --> 1:19:59.030
With Vince, it's just like
he lived this NBA life,

1:19:59.060 --> 1:20:01.140
and you almost have
to look in retrospect

1:20:01.170 --> 1:20:04.090
and say, oh, so this
is what he-- like,

1:20:04.120 --> 1:20:06.020
this is what he
was in this period.

1:20:06.050 --> 1:20:10.230
But it was just this natural
conversion of who he was

1:20:11.020 --> 1:20:12.160
over the course of his career.

1:20:12.190 --> 1:20:14.120
I did not think it
was going to last.

1:20:14.150 --> 1:20:15.160
Like, I just didn't.

1:20:15.190 --> 1:20:17.000
I didn't think he was going to--

1:20:17.030 --> 1:20:18.140
guy was going to
play two decades.

1:20:18.170 --> 1:20:20.070
Never, never.

1:20:20.100 --> 1:20:22.000
When people think
of me, you know,

1:20:22.030 --> 1:20:23.220
they're going to
think of dunking.

1:20:24.010 --> 1:20:26.020
So when I'm asked about what
I want people to remember

1:20:26.050 --> 1:20:29.090
is of my legacy, I will
talk about the dunking

1:20:29.120 --> 1:20:31.110
because I know that's going
to take care of itself anyway.

1:20:31.140 --> 1:20:33.040
[laughs]

1:20:33.070 --> 1:20:36.050
You know, he just wanted to
show people that his game was

1:20:36.080 --> 1:20:38.180
on the ground as well as
in air and that he could

1:20:38.210 --> 1:20:42.030
be this fundamentally sound
player who could do it all,

1:20:42.060 --> 1:20:43.080
and he did.

1:20:43.110 --> 1:20:45.000
Vince Carter
keeps the game pure.

1:20:45.030 --> 1:20:49.020
He filters it, and he doesn't
allow the negative things

1:20:49.050 --> 1:20:50.070
to fall through.

1:20:50.100 --> 1:20:51.230
That takes a lot.

1:20:52.020 --> 1:20:54.040
To carry the league,
which he did,

1:20:54.070 --> 1:20:57.160
and then mentor guys who
couldn't carry his shoes

1:20:57.190 --> 1:21:01.040
at times, that takes
a real humility,

1:21:01.070 --> 1:21:03.000
and I admire him for that.

1:21:03.030 --> 1:21:06.140
Whether it's seeing him
working on his broadcast career

1:21:06.170 --> 1:21:10.130
or knowing the time and effort
that he's put in to maintain

1:21:10.160 --> 1:21:17.140
his athleticism, my view of
him has changed dramatically,

1:21:17.170 --> 1:21:21.050
and I think what makes it most
authentic is that Vince wasn't

1:21:21.080 --> 1:21:24.060
trying to persuade anybody.

1:21:24.090 --> 1:21:25.190
He never made a
concerted effort like,

1:21:25.220 --> 1:21:28.130
I'm going to change
your view of who I am.

1:21:28.160 --> 1:21:31.000
I'm just going to
continue to be who I am,

1:21:31.030 --> 1:21:32.210
and then, eventually,
you'll get it.

1:21:33.000 --> 1:21:35.170
So Vince, I got.

1:21:35.200 --> 1:21:39.230
To tell a guy who's been as
great as Vince or Karl Malone

1:21:40.020 --> 1:21:43.220
or Patrick Ewing or myself
that your life sucks

1:21:44.010 --> 1:21:48.060
because you didn't win a couple
more basketball game, I think--

1:21:48.090 --> 1:21:49.190
first of all, I
think it's stupid.

1:21:49.220 --> 1:21:53.030
And for him to maintain his
excellence for this long

1:21:53.060 --> 1:21:54.200
is incredible.

1:21:54.230 --> 1:21:56.220
That's what makes him special.

1:21:57.010 --> 1:21:58.140
Nobody who's
made it to the NBA

1:21:58.170 --> 1:22:02.040
didn't spend how many hours
on the court, sometimes

1:22:02.070 --> 1:22:04.090
after the sun goes down when
they were supposed to be home

1:22:04.120 --> 1:22:06.070
already, just getting
in a few more shots,

1:22:06.100 --> 1:22:07.190
"I just want to play
a little bit more",

1:22:07.220 --> 1:22:10.160
when no one was watching
when they're 11 years old.

1:22:10.190 --> 1:22:13.190
And Vince, to me, epitomized
toward the end of his career

1:22:13.220 --> 1:22:16.220
that I just want to-- just let
me get a few more shots out.

1:22:17.010 --> 1:22:18.160
That's a love of the game, man.

1:22:18.190 --> 1:22:23.160
My favorite thing about Vince
Carter is who he is as a man.

1:22:23.190 --> 1:22:27.140
It's who he is as a person,
who he is as a friend,

1:22:27.170 --> 1:22:31.230
Who he is as a family member.

1:22:32.020 --> 1:22:36.050
Everything that he stands
for would be a great man

1:22:36.080 --> 1:22:38.210
on and off the
basketball court, Hall

1:22:39.000 --> 1:22:43.170
of Fame player, indeed, but
definitely a Hall of Fame man.

1:22:43.200 --> 1:22:45.170
Am I a sure-fire
Hall of Famer?

1:22:45.200 --> 1:22:47.200
Ah, you know, I hope so.

1:22:47.230 --> 1:22:49.080
I would love to be
in the Hall of Fame.

1:22:49.110 --> 1:22:52.110
If I do have that
opportunity, it would probably

1:22:52.140 --> 1:22:54.160
be as a Toronto Raptor.

1:22:54.190 --> 1:22:56.230
I want people to see me
more than just a dunker.

1:22:57.020 --> 1:22:58.160
I want you to
realize that I have--

1:22:58.190 --> 1:23:02.080
it's more to me and my game
than just my ability to dunk.

1:23:02.110 --> 1:23:05.050
That's the mentality I created.

1:23:05.080 --> 1:23:07.160
That's just how I've gone
about it and learned,

1:23:07.190 --> 1:23:09.000
and that's what I
expect of myself.

1:23:09.030 --> 1:23:10.060
If you're going to
wear the uniform,

1:23:10.090 --> 1:23:12.170
you want to go out
there and compete.

1:23:12.200 --> 1:23:15.210
It was about fulfilling
the love that I

1:23:16.000 --> 1:23:18.210
still have inside for the game.
