11:09.294 --> 11:11.088
- When?
- Tonight.

11:11.088 --> 11:12.464
Okay. Where?

11:12.464 --> 11:15.008
Wherever you want.
Except my house.

11:15.008 --> 11:16.760
My parents don't let me
have girls in my room.

11:16.760 --> 11:18.804
We can do it at my house.
Nobody cares what I do.

11:18.804 --> 11:20.890
- What time?
- After dinner.

11:20.890 --> 11:22.974
Come eat with us.
We're doing barbecue.

11:22.974 --> 11:24.309
- Okay.
- Cool.

11:24.309 --> 11:26.770
Cool.

11:31.066 --> 11:32.400
[baby crying]
[knocking]

11:32.400 --> 11:34.027
(man)
Can you turn
that crappy music down

11:34.027 --> 11:35.821
and tell those fucking
babies to shut up?

11:35.821 --> 11:37.823
Hey, watch your
mouth, college boy.

11:37.823 --> 11:39.616
I got babies here.
[phone ringing]

11:39.616 --> 11:40.992
Just one little bite.
Come on.

11:40.992 --> 11:44.872
Just one little bite.
Hello?

11:44.872 --> 11:46.874
One of my breast pumpers'
boobies dried up,

11:46.874 --> 11:49.501
so we'll be tight on funds
until I find a replacement.

11:49.501 --> 11:51.545
Okay, well, you know what?
I hooked up with some

11:51.545 --> 11:54.673
cheap-ass herb the other day,
so I'll try to move it quick.

11:54.673 --> 11:56.591
Oh, and Gemma,
I don't know,

11:56.591 --> 11:58.510
but she had a little
sniffle earlier.

11:58.510 --> 11:59.804
I think she's sick.

11:59.804 --> 12:01.805
Can you, uh, use the
nasal aspirator on her

12:01.805 --> 12:02.973
before she goes
to bed tonight?

12:02.973 --> 12:04.307
Will do.

12:04.307 --> 12:06.393
(man)
Dude, I gotta study!

12:06.393 --> 12:08.019
Oh, it sounds like
you have your hands full.

12:08.019 --> 12:09.396
Yeah, kinda.
I gotta go.

12:09.396 --> 12:10.815
- Okay.
- All right, talk soon.

12:10.815 --> 12:15.861
[knocking]

12:15.861 --> 12:17.571
Come on, bro.
I was up all night, man.

12:17.571 --> 12:19.030
They slept horribly
too, you know?

12:19.030 --> 12:21.491
The guy next door screams like a
Polish grandma when he comes.

12:21.491 --> 12:22.785
Why'd you bring 'em here?

12:22.785 --> 12:24.327
Where else am I
supposed to bring 'em?

12:24.327 --> 12:26.288
I live here, bro.
It's only one night a week.

12:26.288 --> 12:28.331
- Are you even a student?
- Not exactly.

12:28.331 --> 12:30.793
I'm more like a refugee
who sells weed.

12:30.793 --> 12:32.752
Drug dealers don't get
to live on campus.

12:32.752 --> 12:35.923
Oh, yeah?
Where does it say that?

12:35.923 --> 12:38.175
Hey, Charlie Brown,
go fuck yourself.

12:38.175 --> 12:39.968
Linus is the one
with the blanket.

12:39.968 --> 12:44.306
Well, they both
can suck dicks.

12:44.306 --> 12:45.975
They're talking about
turning your ass in.

12:45.975 --> 12:49.644
Oh, are they now?

12:49.644 --> 12:51.438
Okay.

12:51.438 --> 12:54.191
Okay, I'll just pack
my shit and go.

12:54.191 --> 12:55.567
Yeah.
But wait a minute.

12:55.567 --> 12:58.528
What am I supposed to do
with all these dime bags

12:58.528 --> 12:59.905
that I was gonna sell
for half price

12:59.905 --> 13:01.907
for the next
ten minutes?

13:01.907 --> 13:03.909
(woman)
Cheap weed!

13:03.909 --> 13:04.868
(man)
Cheap weed, down here!

13:04.868 --> 13:06.161
(woman)
Whoo!

13:06.161 --> 13:07.495
(man)
Five bucks for a dime bag?

13:07.495 --> 13:08.747
- I want some.
- Thin walls.

13:11.333 --> 13:12.334
(man)
Here you go.

13:14.377 --> 13:17.464
No, no, no.
No weapons in juvie.

13:17.464 --> 13:19.382
Pop Rocks and Fire Ants.

13:19.382 --> 13:21.927
Figure Carl could use
them for self defense.

13:21.927 --> 13:25.848
- Is that a thing?
- Who knows?

13:25.848 --> 13:27.140
I want to go to
Planned Parenthood today.

13:27.140 --> 13:29.392
I need you to come with.

13:29.392 --> 13:31.311
For the pill?

13:31.311 --> 13:33.022
Well, I thought that messed
with your training.

13:33.022 --> 13:35.398
It's whatever.

13:35.398 --> 13:37.025
Are you and Derek
having sex?

13:37.025 --> 13:39.028
Not yet.

13:39.028 --> 13:40.779
Well, why rush?
I mean, it's been what,

13:40.779 --> 13:42.447
- a few weeks.
- I want to.

13:42.447 --> 13:44.867
It's my body,
it's my decision.

13:44.867 --> 13:46.117
Debs.

13:46.117 --> 13:48.037
I've been dating him longer
than you even knew Gus

13:48.037 --> 13:50.039
before you got married.

13:56.003 --> 13:57.963
- I'll make an appointment.
- Thanks.

13:57.963 --> 13:59.881
Oh, FYI, water
got shut off.

13:59.881 --> 14:02.092
You should probably
pay the bill.

14:11.851 --> 14:15.605
[ambient noise distorted]

14:15.605 --> 14:17.857
[phone ringing]

14:17.857 --> 14:20.860
[muffled noise]

15:06.991 --> 15:08.575
Fuck!

15:08.575 --> 15:11.078
You okay, man?

15:11.078 --> 15:12.162
Yeah, yeah.

15:12.162 --> 15:13.246
Damn.

15:13.246 --> 15:14.247
Take this.

15:14.247 --> 15:16.249
How'd that happen?

15:20.712 --> 15:22.714
Yo, you need me to get
you the first aid kit?

15:24.924 --> 15:28.928
Why are women such
capricious devils?

15:28.928 --> 15:31.431
Is it simple biology?

15:31.431 --> 15:35.685
They get emotional whiplash from
all the hairpin hormonal turns?

15:35.685 --> 15:38.104
- Harder, baby, yeah.
- Okay, okay, okay, yeah.

15:38.104 --> 15:41.358
Or are they just trying
so hard to "lean in"

15:41.358 --> 15:43.234
and "have it all"

15:43.234 --> 15:45.236
they lose sight of
their own humanity?

15:45.236 --> 15:47.364
- Right there.
- Okay.

15:47.364 --> 15:51.451
Yeah. Yeah.
Or, fuck.

15:51.451 --> 15:54.537
what if evolutionarily
they're programmed

15:54.537 --> 15:58.375
to hold onto the past in order
to educate their offspring

15:58.375 --> 16:00.169
about the perils
of going out--

16:00.169 --> 16:01.127
Jesus!

16:01.127 --> 16:02.837
Don't. Wait, wait.
You stopping?

16:02.837 --> 16:04.881
Yes, Captain Perceptive.

16:04.881 --> 16:06.049
I bought you
a boilermaker.

16:06.049 --> 16:08.176
You'd have to buy me ten
to suffer through that.

16:08.176 --> 16:10.637
You gotta help me to get
this woman out of my system.

16:10.637 --> 16:12.764
Go stick your dick
in an ice cream cake

16:12.764 --> 16:14.516
and nurture your
inner child.

16:14.516 --> 16:16.559
I'm not your
fucking therapist.

16:25.110 --> 16:28.571
Trust a woman
to do a man's job.

16:30.657 --> 16:32.159
Water got shut off.

16:32.159 --> 16:34.244
We gotta use your bathroom.
I paid the fucking bill

16:34.244 --> 16:37.247
but it takes two days for
them to turn it back on.

16:37.247 --> 16:38.706
You look pretty.

16:38.706 --> 16:41.000
Having Skype sex
with Gus later.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.710
This distance
thing is bullshit.

16:42.710 --> 16:44.504
You're telling me.
This is the longest I've gone

16:44.504 --> 16:46.173
without seeing Kev
since I met him.

16:46.173 --> 16:47.507
About to burst
into flames.

16:47.507 --> 16:49.217
You guys talk
about anything yet?

16:49.217 --> 16:50.218
Sure.

16:50.218 --> 16:51.428
"How was Gemma's
tummy time?"

16:51.428 --> 16:52.804
"When did Amy's
hiccups stop?"

16:52.804 --> 16:56.141
You stuff, I mean.
Like, what you both want.

16:56.141 --> 16:57.851
From each other.

16:57.851 --> 16:59.519
I want the old Kev back.

16:59.519 --> 17:01.604
The one who looked at me like
the world stopped spinning.

17:01.604 --> 17:04.108
He's there.
He's just preoccupied.

17:04.108 --> 17:06.943
Okay, ladies,
listen up.

17:06.943 --> 17:09.529
- I need help.
- That's my cue.

17:09.529 --> 17:11.865
Let's go.
Poop time!

17:11.865 --> 17:15.160
This woman is just
tearing me up.

17:15.160 --> 17:16.369
I just can't shake her.

17:16.369 --> 17:18.205
Why are you
a country song?

17:18.205 --> 17:19.581
I treated her with respect

17:19.581 --> 17:22.126
and she shat me out
like yesterday's cheese steak.

17:22.126 --> 17:23.960
The only thing you ever
treated with respect

17:23.960 --> 17:26.171
had a label and the word
"proof" on it.

17:26.171 --> 17:27.547
(V)
Wait.

17:27.547 --> 17:29.299
This that doctor
from the other day?

17:29.299 --> 17:32.051
Maybe.

17:32.051 --> 17:33.094
What's the scam?

17:33.094 --> 17:35.138
What kind of a man
do you think I am?

17:35.138 --> 17:37.015
There's always a scam,
Frank.

17:37.015 --> 17:38.558
All right, yes.
I'm very good

17:38.558 --> 17:39.851
at sticking it
to the man,

17:39.851 --> 17:42.604
but this woman...

17:42.604 --> 17:44.856
I don't want to stick
anything to her.

17:44.856 --> 17:47.066
Except myself,
but she won't let me.

17:47.066 --> 17:48.985
Why would anybody
want to be with you?

17:48.985 --> 17:50.653
Well, why wouldn't they?

17:50.653 --> 17:53.198
Chlamydia and herpes
for starts.

17:53.198 --> 17:57.286
Poor hygiene, alcoholism,
lack of a moral compass.

17:57.286 --> 18:00.872
Fine. But my good qualities
vastly outweigh my bad ones.

18:00.872 --> 18:02.457
Name one.

18:02.457 --> 18:06.628
How about, uh, a lust for
adventure, a bottomless libido?

18:06.628 --> 18:08.505
- Jesus.
- I show up with drugs,

18:08.505 --> 18:10.381
companionship,
pro-bono sex.

18:10.381 --> 18:13.384
What more could
a dying woman want?

18:13.384 --> 18:16.721
This is for real?

18:16.721 --> 18:18.139
How the hell
should I know?

18:18.139 --> 18:20.642
Make it like the world stops
spinning when you look at her.

18:20.642 --> 18:22.310
I tried that.
It didn't work.

18:22.310 --> 18:24.354
What else you got?

18:28.566 --> 18:33.655
Well, thanks, people.

18:33.655 --> 18:36.658
Hmm.

18:36.658 --> 18:39.661
You were a big fucking help.

18:47.294 --> 18:49.295
[people giggling in hallway]

18:50.713 --> 18:53.300
Hey.
Hey.

18:53.300 --> 18:55.426
What the hell's
going on out there?

18:55.426 --> 18:57.554
Yeah, I don't know.
Saturday, I guess.

18:57.554 --> 19:00.349
Look at you all
studious in here.

19:00.349 --> 19:01.683
- Get your tuition sorted?
- Yeah.

19:01.683 --> 19:05.270
I'm on all rosters and
fully matriculated.

19:05.270 --> 19:07.063
How'd you pull that off?

19:07.063 --> 19:09.941
Deus ex machina,
as they say.

19:09.941 --> 19:11.150
Hmm.

19:11.150 --> 19:13.361
And how's the lovely
Ms. Muff Bulldagger.

19:13.361 --> 19:15.488
- Fiery and full of lust.
- Yeah?

19:15.488 --> 19:17.490
Like a coked-up
Amish teenager.

19:17.490 --> 19:20.660
- Oh, that sounds exhausting.
- Oh, you have no idea.

19:20.660 --> 19:23.871
I'm thinking of going
strictly dickly for a while.

19:23.871 --> 19:25.582
You free later?

19:25.582 --> 19:30.295
No, actually, uh,
I got this thing.

19:30.295 --> 19:33.172
Um, a school thing
or a sex thing?

19:33.172 --> 19:36.467
Um, uh, both.

19:36.467 --> 19:39.053
Meaning?

19:39.053 --> 19:41.973
I-I kinda got this situation
with one of my professors.

19:41.973 --> 19:43.433
Uh-oh.
Which class?

19:43.433 --> 19:45.352
It's Crit Theory.

19:45.352 --> 19:47.271
- Professor Wallace.
- Yeah, yeah.

19:47.271 --> 19:50.148
Her and her hubby, they have
this, uh, agreement, you know?

19:50.148 --> 19:52.942
- They're--they're evolved.
- Wait, her husband?

19:52.942 --> 19:55.361
Yeah, yeah.
It's actually--it's kinda great.

19:55.361 --> 19:57.196
So you're having a
relationship

19:57.196 --> 19:59.240
- with a married woman?
- No, no, no, no.

19:59.240 --> 20:02.327
It's--it's not
a relationship.

20:02.327 --> 20:05.204
We just--we hang out.

20:05.204 --> 20:07.540
Uh, she shows me
art and stuff.

20:07.540 --> 20:09.375
Hmm, are you
falling for her?

20:09.375 --> 20:13.921
No. No, I'm just
having fun.

20:13.921 --> 20:15.506
Well, then ditch her

20:15.506 --> 20:20.386
and come play naked
Go Fish with me.

20:20.386 --> 20:23.765
I would, um,

20:23.765 --> 20:28.437
just I got all this--
all this shit to do.

20:28.437 --> 20:30.438
No prob.

20:30.438 --> 20:33.024
I'll see you around.

20:33.024 --> 20:34.025
Okay.

20:35.443 --> 20:38.571
Oh, PS I need my car back
at some point.

20:52.835 --> 20:54.504
[screaming in hallway]

20:57.215 --> 20:58.216
(man)
[groaning]
Oh, God.

20:58.216 --> 20:59.425
I'm trippin' out, man.

20:59.425 --> 21:01.260
Hey, are you okay, man?

21:01.260 --> 21:04.847
I love God...
And icebergs.

21:04.847 --> 21:06.475
What--what the fuck's
wrong with him?

21:06.475 --> 21:08.477
It's that trip-weed
your friend sold us.

21:08.477 --> 21:09.644
It wasn't normal shit.

21:09.644 --> 21:11.396
It was synthetic marijuana,
dildo.

21:11.396 --> 21:15.066
Laced with all sort of crap.
It makes you lose your mind.

21:19.570 --> 21:21.280
Oh, God.

21:21.280 --> 21:22.990
What happened
to your hand?

21:22.990 --> 21:25.368
- Uh, burned myself.
- Hold on.

21:28.705 --> 21:31.374
- That's our lamp.
- It's ugly and no one uses it.

21:33.292 --> 21:35.628
Come here.

21:35.628 --> 21:40.466
Come on.
I'm not gonna bite.

21:44.554 --> 21:46.515
Did you run it
under cool water?

21:46.515 --> 21:48.182
No.

21:48.182 --> 21:50.518
Well, then you are shit
out of luck in this house.

21:50.518 --> 21:52.479
No water.

21:52.479 --> 21:54.356
Ooh.

21:54.356 --> 21:56.483
Gonna have a nice,
fat scar.

21:56.483 --> 21:58.901
It'll match the one
I got in the army.

21:58.901 --> 22:00.319
How'd you get that one?

22:00.319 --> 22:02.864
I tried to hotwire
a helicopter.

22:02.864 --> 22:04.491
Burned myself
on the starter.

22:04.491 --> 22:06.868
[chuckles]
You can hotwire a helicopter?

22:06.868 --> 22:08.870
Not very good,
apparently.

22:08.870 --> 22:11.122
Got caught trying to steal
government property

22:11.122 --> 22:14.543
and that's why the
MPs are after me.

22:14.543 --> 22:17.336
Well, that and
going AWOL.

22:17.336 --> 22:19.881
And enlisting under
a false identity.

22:19.881 --> 22:21.340
And maybe other stuff.

22:21.340 --> 22:23.301
Wow.
Pretty hardcore.

22:23.301 --> 22:27.556
No, just
mentally ill.

22:27.556 --> 22:30.475
God, this place
brings back memories.

22:30.475 --> 22:31.684
You've been here before?

22:31.684 --> 22:34.687
Monica brought me here
when I needed to go on the pill.

22:34.687 --> 22:37.566
She was completely strung out
on E.

22:37.566 --> 22:39.526
She offered to give my doctor
a blowjob.

22:39.526 --> 22:42.195
- A female doctor.
- How is that possible?

22:42.195 --> 22:45.407
Well, obviously she didn't
get very far.

22:45.407 --> 22:48.951
Doctor was pretty butch.
Honest mistake.

22:48.951 --> 22:52.330
Everything looks good.

22:52.330 --> 22:54.499
I'm gonna set you up
on some starter pills.

22:54.499 --> 22:56.417
Great.
Thanks.

22:56.417 --> 22:59.629
Now hold up a second
'cause this is no joke.

22:59.629 --> 23:02.173
These don't begin to work
for 48 hours.

23:02.173 --> 23:04.967
So if you plan to have
intercourse before then,

23:04.967 --> 23:07.345
you must use
alternate protection.

23:07.345 --> 23:08.471
Okay.

23:08.471 --> 23:10.598
I'll get those pills.

23:13.768 --> 23:15.645
Really?

23:15.645 --> 23:17.522
They're free.

23:24.153 --> 23:26.113
Yo.

23:26.113 --> 23:27.323
- Jesus.
- Fucking amazing.

23:27.323 --> 23:29.158
What the fuck is wrong
with these kids?

23:29.158 --> 23:30.452
The fucking weed
you sold them.

23:30.452 --> 23:31.453
Some shit called spice.

23:31.453 --> 23:33.455
(Kevin)
That was spice?

23:33.455 --> 23:34.831
Oh, no wonder
I got a discount.

23:34.831 --> 23:36.415
This shit can last
for hours, all right?

23:36.415 --> 23:37.625
We need to keep everybody
in the room,

23:37.625 --> 23:39.126
lock the door,
just wait it out.

23:39.126 --> 23:40.629
Can you go sweep the hall,
check for any stragglers?

23:40.629 --> 23:41.629
Yeah, I got it.

23:41.629 --> 23:43.422
All right, find any
unopened bags, toss them.

23:43.422 --> 23:45.341
If you have any left,
get rid of it, all right?

23:45.341 --> 23:46.425
Yeah.
Aye-aye, captain.

23:55.142 --> 23:58.563
That's gotta be
a metaphor for something.

24:01.107 --> 24:02.316
This was the only straggler.

24:02.316 --> 24:03.609
I think he's trying to find
a portal.

24:03.609 --> 24:05.820
All right, just close the door
and lock it, yeah?

24:05.820 --> 24:08.948
(Joaquin)
I am made of fire.

24:08.948 --> 24:10.908
Look, if we call 911,
we could go to jail.

24:10.908 --> 24:12.326
I mean,
we could both go to jail.

24:12.326 --> 24:13.578
Why? We didn't force them
to do anything.

24:13.578 --> 24:14.996
A tiny floating sun.

24:14.996 --> 24:16.706
They're grown-ups
who made grown-up decisions.

24:16.706 --> 24:17.874
No, most of these kids
are minors.

24:17.874 --> 24:20.459
(Joaquin)
Swirling ball of hot gases.

24:20.459 --> 24:21.752

24:21.752 --> 24:23.462

24:23.462 --> 24:25.298

What the fuck?

24:25.298 --> 24:28.384
(Joaquin)
Oh, shit!

24:28.384 --> 24:30.052

[laughs]

24:31.679 --> 24:33.890
(Frank)
God damn it!

24:33.890 --> 24:37.519
The one day all year
I gotta shower, the water's off.

24:37.519 --> 24:38.644
Give me your deodorant.

24:38.644 --> 24:41.690
- Ran out.
- Well, of course you did.

24:41.690 --> 24:46.777
Why would anyone in this house
make things easy on me?

24:46.777 --> 24:49.238
It's no substitute
for cleanliness,

24:49.238 --> 24:50.532
but this will have
to do.

24:50.532 --> 24:54.201
I may have to scrub my junk
at the Citgo.

24:54.201 --> 24:56.996
Wish me luck.

24:56.996 --> 24:58.456
Good luck scrubbing
your junk.

25:00.542 --> 25:02.711
Not with my junk.
L'Amour.

25:05.296 --> 25:07.256
You're a dumbass,
you know that?

25:21.270 --> 25:23.690
Hey.
I didn't know which Bs to get,

25:23.690 --> 25:24.899
so I just got all
the fucking Bs.

25:24.899 --> 25:28.695
I got B-complex,
super B-complex, B-12, B-6.

25:28.695 --> 25:29.820
Whoa.

25:29.820 --> 25:31.656
The hell happened
to your hand?

25:31.656 --> 25:35.034
Hey.
What are you doing?

25:35.034 --> 25:36.661
We're going out.

25:36.661 --> 25:38.079
Did a doctor take care
of that?

25:38.079 --> 25:39.538
Come on, Mickey.

25:39.538 --> 25:41.374
You can't go anywhere unless
you get that looked at, man.

25:41.374 --> 25:44.043
- Come on.
- Okay, listen.

25:44.043 --> 25:48.757
Either you can stay here
and jerk off into your vitamins

25:48.757 --> 25:52.719
or you can come with me.

25:52.719 --> 25:54.679
It's your call.

26:04.063 --> 26:05.564

Hey.
Hey!

26:20.705 --> 26:23.332
You must be
the homeless guy.

26:23.332 --> 26:25.334
I have a home.
Intermittently.

26:25.334 --> 26:26.335
Who the hell are you?

26:26.335 --> 26:27.837
Bianca's sister.

26:27.837 --> 26:29.463
Party's over, asshole.

26:29.463 --> 26:31.966
Go crawl back to your mattress
beneath the overpass

26:31.966 --> 26:33.509
and leave
the sick girl alone.

26:33.509 --> 26:35.679
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You have no idea

26:35.679 --> 26:37.847
who you're dealing with,
lady.

26:37.847 --> 26:42.309
I am indefatigable.
I take "yes" for an answer.

26:42.309 --> 26:46.981

Just you watch me!

27:15.134 --> 27:17.344
Motherfuck!

27:20.097 --> 27:23.142
Open your fucking window!

27:23.142 --> 27:24.560
Open the window!

27:30.817 --> 27:32.943
I can't offer you much,

27:32.943 --> 27:37.031
but what I can do is--
is be your chauffeur

27:37.031 --> 27:39.325
on the limousine ride
to the pearly gates.

27:39.325 --> 27:40.659
My what?

27:40.659 --> 27:42.828
I know how it feels to live like
you're gonna die tomorrow.

27:42.828 --> 27:44.955
I've been there.

27:44.955 --> 27:47.208
I make each day
feel like a wild ride

27:47.208 --> 27:49.753
through the heart
of the rapids at midnight.

27:49.753 --> 27:53.672
If you want to squeeze
every last drop of gratification

27:53.672 --> 27:55.049
out of this world
before you croak,

27:55.049 --> 27:56.801
I'm your man.

27:56.801 --> 27:59.678
- Frank, I'm--
- Stick with me, woman,

27:59.678 --> 28:02.223
and you will not go gentle
into that good night.

28:02.223 --> 28:05.518
(Elizabeth)
Bianca?

28:05.518 --> 28:07.520
Come on.

28:07.520 --> 28:09.647
Oh, great.

28:09.647 --> 28:11.357
Cock-blocking Laura Bush.

28:11.357 --> 28:14.026
Fine!
[grunts]

28:16.738 --> 28:18.740
You see this bottle of vodka?

28:18.740 --> 28:20.825
I'm gonna sit over there

28:20.825 --> 28:23.953
and I'm gonna sip it.

28:23.953 --> 28:26.288
If you don't join me
by the time I'm done,

28:26.288 --> 28:30.209
consider my offer revoked.

28:33.629 --> 28:34.839
Hi.

28:34.839 --> 28:36.800
- What time is it?
- Just after 5:00.

28:36.800 --> 28:38.425

Come on.

28:54.650 --> 28:56.068
Easy.

28:59.029 --> 29:00.739
Jesus.
What happened?

29:15.171 --> 29:17.506
Hey, it's me.

29:17.506 --> 29:19.383
The house is quiet.

29:19.383 --> 29:21.218
Computer's on.

29:21.218 --> 29:23.637
I'm wearing
my lacy green thong.

29:23.637 --> 29:26.348
Hit me back.

29:38.944 --> 29:41.030
Hey, don't you have anything
better to do with your time?

29:41.030 --> 29:43.699
I'm supposed to be having
hot Skype sex

29:43.699 --> 29:45.910
with my husband,
but he's M.I.A.

29:45.910 --> 29:48.037
(Sean)
Tragic. What else?

29:48.037 --> 29:49.455
(Fiona)
I cleaned the house,

29:49.455 --> 29:52.541
which was in shambles
because that bitch

29:52.541 --> 29:53.960
that claims to be
my older sister

29:53.960 --> 29:55.836
has been boycotting
her domestic duties.

29:55.836 --> 29:59.673
Oh, and I had to take Debbie to
get fucking birth control today.

29:59.673 --> 30:01.967
Holy shit.
I'm glad I have a son.

30:01.967 --> 30:03.719
(Fiona)
How's he doing?

30:03.719 --> 30:05.888
(Sean)
His mom called.
Um, wanted to pick him up early.

30:05.888 --> 30:07.181
Found an earlier flight.

30:07.181 --> 30:08.807
He's just packing up
some of the crap

30:08.807 --> 30:09.975
I keep around here
for him, you know?

30:09.975 --> 30:11.393
Toys and stuff.

30:11.393 --> 30:12.811
Oh, no.
When is she coming?

30:12.811 --> 30:14.563
(Sean)
In like 15 minutes.

30:14.563 --> 30:16.899
I had to step outside
just to keep--

30:16.899 --> 30:18.817
just to keep
my shit together.

30:18.817 --> 30:21.946
Do you want me
to come over?

30:21.946 --> 30:23.197
No, I'm good.

30:23.197 --> 30:24.823
- You don't sound it.
- Yeah.

30:24.823 --> 30:27.035
Well, I don't have a choice.

30:27.035 --> 30:29.703
Hey, you know what,
I gotta go.

30:33.582 --> 30:36.627
- [grunts]

30:36.627 --> 30:38.254
- Where is he?
- Who?

30:38.254 --> 30:39.838
Your husband, the doctor.

30:39.838 --> 30:41.382
That's why you brought
this boy here?

30:41.382 --> 30:42.716
Yeah, yeah.
I thought he could help.

30:42.716 --> 30:44.843
He's a doctor of theology,
not medicine.

30:44.843 --> 30:45.844
Fuck!

30:45.844 --> 30:46.845
Well, what were you
doing in there?

30:46.845 --> 30:48.347
I called 911.

30:48.347 --> 30:50.099
Hang tight, honey, okay?
They're sending an ambulance.

30:50.099 --> 30:52.393
Come here, come here,
come here, come here.

30:52.393 --> 30:55.229
- Why did you do that?
- What did you expect me to do?

30:55.229 --> 30:57.064
He's on drugs, okay?

30:57.064 --> 30:58.440
He could get
kicked out of school,

30:58.440 --> 30:59.858
and my friend
who sold him the drugs,

30:59.858 --> 31:01.443
he's staying illegally
in the dorms.

31:01.443 --> 31:02.820
He could go to jail,
all right?

31:02.820 --> 31:04.571
- He's got three kids.
- This boy is suffering.

31:04.571 --> 31:05.906
He needs help,
regardless of the consequences.

31:05.906 --> 31:07.950
No, no, no.
I gotta cover their asses.

31:07.950 --> 31:10.869
Why?

31:10.869 --> 31:14.082
- South Side rules.
- You know what?

Drop the whole "noble thug"
shtick.

and you know it.

right now.

dropping gifts at your feet.

31:30.431 --> 31:32.433

you're doing

Go back to your dorm.

If the paramedics ask
any questions,

31:42.192 --> 31:43.902
I'll say I walked out
and he was just here.

31:43.902 --> 31:45.362
Just help me move him.

31:45.362 --> 31:47.865
- Are you sure?
- Come on.

31:47.865 --> 31:49.575
Okay, you have any
neck or back pain?

31:49.575 --> 31:51.035
- Come on, Joaquin.
- All right, give me your hand.

- Come on.
- Okay, come on.

the light of my life.

32:37.081 --> 32:39.875
And this family.
When Jake went into the army,

32:39.875 --> 32:41.794
they took me in
and loved me like their own.

32:41.794 --> 32:43.253
But you're not
Derek's sister?

32:43.253 --> 32:45.923
I call her that
'cause she's like a sister.

32:45.923 --> 32:47.800

My mom's a drunk.

32:54.057 --> 32:57.351
I wanted so bad to belong
to something warm and whole,

32:57.351 --> 32:58.977

32:58.977 --> 33:03.149
Nine months later, bam.
I was in.

33:03.149 --> 33:04.650
So you chose
your own family.

33:04.650 --> 33:06.777
Kind of.

doing this?
