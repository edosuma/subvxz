WEBVTT

00:01.267 --> 00:01.468
.

00:07.607 --> 00:10.076
The Geordies are back in the Toon.
Wicked.

00:10.143 --> 00:14.080
(cheering)
We are doing what we do best.

00:14.147 --> 00:15.248
Partying...
Whoo!

00:16.716 --> 00:18.685
Tashing on...

00:18.752 --> 00:20.420
Getting mortal...

00:20.487 --> 00:21.588
Shagging...

00:22.922 --> 00:26.426
It's insane.
Oh, my God! No, no!

00:26.493 --> 00:29.295
(yells)

00:29.362 --> 00:30.730
Whoo-hoo!
(screams)

00:33.366 --> 00:34.934
Shit's about to get real.

00:35.001 --> 00:38.705
Slaggy Susie loves herself
a bit of Larry Lightweight.

00:38.772 --> 00:42.475
I hate to admit it
but I'm actually glad Vicky's here.

00:45.011 --> 00:47.414
The F-bomb. Feelings.

00:48.348 --> 00:52.419
She should be careful. Gary's not
the best of people to start liking.

00:52.485 --> 00:55.655
I feel like I need to get
one last bang out of her

00:55.722 --> 00:57.190
before shit goes west.

01:01.961 --> 01:04.197
I should have a degree in pulling.

01:04.263 --> 01:06.399
I am a Geordie girl with a VIP edge.

01:06.466 --> 01:08.868
I'm a natural beauty,
real boobs, real hair.

01:08.935 --> 01:11.037
I'm gonna tear the place up.

01:11.104 --> 01:13.006
I never kiss without a six-pack.

01:13.072 --> 01:14.941
Hardest graft is doing me hair.

01:15.008 --> 01:17.143
Cheeky, colourful, full of mischief.

01:17.210 --> 01:18.978
I'm fake, flirty, got double-Fs.

01:19.045 --> 01:21.948
I'll make sparks fly
and get everyone feisty.

01:22.015 --> 01:24.284
(all) Geordie Shore, whey-aye.

01:37.230 --> 01:41.701
I'm minging. I don't know how I went
from stone-cold sober to this.

01:41.768 --> 01:45.205
'I've woken up, I'm so hungover.
What the fuck went on?'

01:48.208 --> 01:49.542
What?

01:49.609 --> 01:53.446
(sniggers) Asked Aaron
on a third date. A third?

01:53.513 --> 01:57.450
What the fuck? I turn into such a
fucking girl when I've had a drink.

01:57.517 --> 02:00.220
Know what happens on a third date?
Get fingered.

02:00.286 --> 02:02.188
Does she not know that?

02:02.255 --> 02:04.324
No.
You have to. It's a rule.

02:04.390 --> 02:08.328
Thanks, fucking lasses. There'll be
no fingering going on here.

02:10.763 --> 02:13.166
(laughing) No! Oh, my God.

02:13.867 --> 02:17.804
Take a good long look at your
relationship history, lasses. Slags

02:17.871 --> 02:22.375
Marnie, did you scuttle Gaz?
Well, I got on top.

02:22.442 --> 02:23.676
(laughter)

02:23.743 --> 02:25.411
I slept with Gary again.

02:25.478 --> 02:28.781
Even though I told him I was worried
I might get feelings. Shit.

02:28.848 --> 02:30.884
I was talking to Gary last night...

02:30.950 --> 02:34.888
I even told you, Charlotte, that
if I continue to sleep with Gary

02:34.954 --> 02:37.223
I will get feelings.
You're only human.

02:37.290 --> 02:41.561
If we carry on like this, I'm gonna
get hurt. I must put a stop to it.

02:41.628 --> 02:44.998
If you wanna know how he feels,
you need to speak to him.

02:45.064 --> 02:48.501
I didn't ever think there'd be
a time that the whole

02:48.568 --> 02:52.438
Gary and Charlotte thing would
be dropped, and it's happened.

02:52.505 --> 02:56.576
It's now Gary and Marnie! Yes!

03:00.747 --> 03:02.949
Red alert, red alert.
Aw, mate.

03:03.016 --> 03:04.651
You are F-bombed, mate.

03:04.717 --> 03:08.521
Everyone's taking the piss out of me
cos Marnie said she had feelings.

03:08.588 --> 03:12.292
They know now I'm fucked.
You still jumped in bed with her?

03:12.358 --> 03:14.827
Basically you had feelings sex
last night.

03:14.894 --> 03:17.330
Feelings plus shagging
equals making love.

03:17.397 --> 03:21.200
I was shocked last night, I genuinely
was like, "What did you say?"

03:21.267 --> 03:25.104
With Marnie I don't want to encourage
the feelings, I wanna have fun

03:25.171 --> 03:26.806
and get back to being friends.

03:26.873 --> 03:31.644
Have you agreed to have the big
third date with Vicky? Oh!

03:31.711 --> 03:33.379
Are you joking?

03:33.446 --> 03:37.884
I've never been on a third date.
I'm looking forward, Vicky's sound.

03:37.951 --> 03:41.254
We went out saying we're gonna pull,
I got the F-bomb,

03:41.321 --> 03:42.855
you agreed to a third date.

03:44.324 --> 03:45.925
We're absolutely killing it

03:54.233 --> 03:55.668
I love fast cars.

03:55.735 --> 03:59.572
With all this shit going on,
I've got the perfect idea.

03:59.639 --> 04:01.641
We're gonna go on a track day.

04:01.708 --> 04:03.309
What, like government cars?

04:03.376 --> 04:05.111
Mint cars, fast tracks.

04:07.614 --> 04:09.449
Oh, my God, so exciting.
Yes!

04:11.451 --> 04:13.453
Absolutely buzzing
for this day.

04:13.519 --> 04:17.523
I'm such a good driver. It only took
us seven times to pass me test.

04:17.589 --> 04:19.024
Vroom, vroom.

04:19.091 --> 04:20.526
Vroom!

04:30.637 --> 04:33.006
We've set up a competition,
fucking wicked.

04:33.072 --> 04:35.475
Gaz, good luck,
you're gonna need it.

04:40.513 --> 04:43.549
Me and Scott are the most
competitive people ever.

04:43.616 --> 04:47.987
When it comes to a fast car, racing
round a track, you know I'll win.

04:56.129 --> 04:57.296
I'm left with Marnie.

04:57.363 --> 05:00.199
Only one thing that
we're gonna end up talking about.

05:00.266 --> 05:03.536
Me and you are good friends.
I don't wanna ruin it.

05:03.603 --> 05:08.141
What do we do? That's the tricky
part. Oh, God, it's so confusing.

05:08.207 --> 05:11.944
We just have to not have sex.
I don't wanna end up hating you.

05:12.011 --> 05:13.546
I know, exactly.

05:15.014 --> 05:16.015
Yeah.

05:16.082 --> 05:20.019
It's impossible to sleep and live
with someone and not have feelings.

05:20.086 --> 05:23.322
So try and pull.
It... Really, it will help us.

05:23.389 --> 05:28.294
Go pull, and it'll just turn any
type of feelings I've got off. Yeah.

05:28.361 --> 05:32.131
This conversation needed to happen.
I don't wanna be with Marnie.

05:32.198 --> 05:35.368
Now I need to go and pull
and move on.

05:35.435 --> 05:37.036
I don't wanna hurt you.

05:38.404 --> 05:42.809
I feel sad that this is the end of
me and Gary, but it is for the best.

05:42.875 --> 05:45.044
I needed to get out
before I got hurt.

05:52.085 --> 05:53.886
Brake, brake, brake, brake!

05:53.953 --> 05:57.490
All I can hear is, "Brake, brake!"
I'm like, "No! Fuck off!"

06:00.626 --> 06:03.663
You were last, two minutes 19.
Wasn't really a shock.

06:03.730 --> 06:05.364
Gaz, you won.
Yeah!

06:05.431 --> 06:07.600
I knew he'd do that.

06:07.667 --> 06:09.469
Gaz beat us by two seconds.

06:09.535 --> 06:12.772
Only cos I was weighing the car down
with me killer bicep.

06:22.014 --> 06:25.618
I've just realised me hair's shit.
I look like a pineapple.

06:25.685 --> 06:27.487
I'm gonna get the fucker cut.

06:30.389 --> 06:32.492
See you, kid.
See you.

06:32.558 --> 06:34.026
(laughs)

06:35.828 --> 06:37.630
(laughter)

06:39.665 --> 06:42.735
Did you talk to Gary?
I did. What did he say?

06:42.802 --> 06:46.372
We're just gonna like, leave things,
I've got a Gary ban.

06:46.439 --> 06:50.676
Why don't you just make sure
your fanny stinks. Or hairy? Yeah.

06:50.743 --> 06:52.845
A serious conversation
with Charlotte

06:52.912 --> 06:55.481
is like trying to make
dog shit stick to the wind.

06:55.548 --> 06:57.049
Marnie, don't listen.

06:57.116 --> 07:00.386
Remain clean and shaven
and I'll tell you no. Right, OK.

07:00.453 --> 07:03.089
We're all sitting around,
having a chat

07:03.156 --> 07:08.127
and just generally doing what girls
do best, gossiping and being bitchy.

07:14.066 --> 07:15.067
Mm.

07:16.602 --> 07:17.603
Mm.

07:19.972 --> 07:21.140
I'm rooting for them.

07:21.207 --> 07:24.877
Don't say it like we're like Kate
and Wills. There is no me and Aaron.

07:24.944 --> 07:27.947
Vicky wouldn't say the word
"penis" in biology class.

07:28.014 --> 07:30.183
No way Aaron's cock
is getting a look in.

07:30.249 --> 07:33.319
We get drunk and kiss.
We're confusing that with like...

07:33.386 --> 07:35.488
That's when I found him irritating.

07:35.555 --> 07:38.491
I didn't realise
everyone felt so strongly.

07:38.558 --> 07:41.928
Yes, that's what I said.
Have some crack, have a brain.

07:41.994 --> 07:46.532
We're all slagging off Aaron
and just picking every single fault.

07:46.599 --> 07:47.700
We're being bitchy.

07:47.767 --> 07:49.202
He's scared of you.

07:49.268 --> 07:51.938
Why the fuck would he be
scared of me?

07:52.004 --> 07:53.573
(laughter)
Oh, fuck him.

07:53.639 --> 07:55.775
If he can't handle us,
he can fuck off.

07:55.842 --> 07:58.044
You're not even bothered, man.
I'm not.

07:58.110 --> 08:00.646
What if he takes you on a really
incredible date,

08:00.713 --> 08:01.848
wines and dines you?

08:01.914 --> 08:05.818
Then it makes him
all the bigger of a mug, doesn't it?

08:05.885 --> 08:10.089
(laughter)
I hear the girls slagging us off.

08:10.156 --> 08:12.825
How fucking two-faced
do you wanna be?

08:16.729 --> 08:20.967
Vicky says that she'd only sleep
with us if I was a different man.

08:21.033 --> 08:24.837
Hold on, every night
you hang off me neck, so fuck off.

08:24.904 --> 08:29.375
"He'd only get near me if he was
someone else." Fucking hell, man.

08:29.442 --> 08:35.047
The girls have been slagging Aaron
off and he's heard every word of it.

08:35.114 --> 08:37.116
Things are gonna kick off big time.

08:43.089 --> 08:46.525
Don't know what he must be thinking.
He'll be fucking furious.

08:46.592 --> 08:50.096
And he'll think I'm a wanker,
which in fairness, I fucking am.

08:52.832 --> 08:55.368
I can't fucking believe it,
I feel so bad.

08:55.434 --> 08:57.637
He hasn't actually done
anything wrong.

08:59.472 --> 09:04.143
I thought they were me friends. I've
never said a bad word against them.

09:07.680 --> 09:10.716
I'm not bothered,
I'm going in here, like.

09:12.585 --> 09:15.521
This is a bit awkward for me.
It's more awkward for us.

09:15.588 --> 09:18.291
I'm just glad that you said
what you had to say

09:18.357 --> 09:20.326
cos now I know how you really feel.

09:20.393 --> 09:23.296
It's the most awkward moment
of my entire life.

09:23.362 --> 09:25.865
I thought you were me mate,
you're clearly not.

09:25.932 --> 09:27.700
Marnie stuck up for us.

09:27.767 --> 09:31.904
From now on I won't even say hello,
if that's how yous wanna be.

09:31.971 --> 09:34.974
That's not. Aaron, please.
I don't wanna talk to yous.

09:35.041 --> 09:38.010
Awkwardness aside,
I need to try and sort this out.

09:38.077 --> 09:41.414
So when he storms out I follow him,
to make amends.

09:41.480 --> 09:45.084
I don't blame you if you're mad,
at all. I'm not mad.

09:45.151 --> 09:48.487
I'm just disappointed because
you asked us for a third date.

09:48.554 --> 09:51.657
Did you want to go? I did.
I like spending time with you.

09:51.724 --> 09:55.094
"The only way he'd get close to me
is if he was someone else."

09:55.161 --> 09:56.429
Fucking hell.

09:56.495 --> 09:59.298
(sighs) I'm such a wanker.

09:59.365 --> 10:02.501
How'd you feel if we were ripping
into you? I feel terrible.

10:02.568 --> 10:05.104
I feel like shit.
I'm not bothered.

10:05.171 --> 10:07.139
Not winning me round. Fuck off.

10:07.206 --> 10:11.143
I won't fucking rip into you
cos you don't wanna be me friend.

10:11.210 --> 10:15.047
Saying, "Vicky would never get near
me unless she was someone else."

10:15.114 --> 10:18.451
I'm so frustrated
I can't get Aaron to forgive us.

10:18.517 --> 10:22.888
I know I was in the wrong. I want
everything to go back to how it was.

10:22.955 --> 10:25.624
Honestly, I have tried to apologise.
I've tried.

10:25.691 --> 10:29.428
No, you haven't. I'm really, really
sorry and all you wanna do is argue.

10:29.495 --> 10:32.231
Of course I do.
Well, I'm sorry! (door slams)

10:33.666 --> 10:37.436
But he's too mad and angry
to see past any of that.

10:37.503 --> 10:39.505
You all right? Come here.
No.

10:39.572 --> 10:43.576
Vicky can see that she's not winning
the argument, so she storms out.

10:43.642 --> 10:46.912
I dunno why you're angry, mate,
you're in the wrong. Piss off.

10:48.914 --> 10:51.717
This house isn't gonna be
a nice place to be.

10:51.784 --> 10:54.653
Once I've had a drink,
the fucking truth will come out

10:54.720 --> 10:55.955
and it won't be pretty.

10:57.156 --> 10:59.191
That'll teach you,
you fucking prick.

11:03.396 --> 11:06.432
Nice Vicky is gone.
Let him out now!

11:07.233 --> 11:09.268
One of the worst nights of my life.

11:09.335 --> 11:12.304
(all) Geordie Shore, whey-aye.

11:14.006 --> 11:14.206
.

11:16.809 --> 11:17.009
.

11:27.787 --> 11:30.656
Slick Daddy T-Dog back
in the fucking mix.

11:46.038 --> 11:49.575
We come back from our haircuts
and it's like a fucking war zone.

11:53.012 --> 11:57.049
I just feel sorry and stupid.
I've hurt him and he's a nice lad.

11:57.116 --> 11:59.985
He didn't deserve it.
And I'm just a fucking cock.

12:00.052 --> 12:04.457
Right now there is no talking myself
out if this. Aaron is furious.

12:04.523 --> 12:07.026
I don't know how to make this right.

12:09.695 --> 12:11.530
(phone rings)

12:12.631 --> 12:13.632
Hi.

12:19.605 --> 12:20.773
Work tonight.

12:20.840 --> 12:22.308
Who? Everyone.
Oh!

12:22.374 --> 12:24.810
Ah, I knew it.

12:24.877 --> 12:29.682
I've got to spend a night with
the man who completely hates us.

12:29.748 --> 12:32.251
Thanks very much, Anna.
You fucking tosser.

12:35.321 --> 12:38.757
When things like this happen
you've gotta stick by your mates,

12:38.824 --> 12:41.327
so tonight we're gonna have
a wicked night.

12:43.562 --> 12:45.564
I know what's gonna happen.

12:45.631 --> 12:48.667
The lads are gonna take
Aaron's side, the lasses mine.

12:48.734 --> 12:51.337
We're gonna have a massive divide
on our hands.

12:51.403 --> 12:54.073
I feel I'm bang in the middle
of West Side Story.

13:05.584 --> 13:07.520
I'm dreading tonight with Aaron.

13:07.586 --> 13:11.590
I don't know what to say to him,
and I'm just a little bit scared.

13:16.795 --> 13:21.267
We're off to work. Aaron hasn't
spoke to any of the girls bar Marnie

13:21.333 --> 13:24.136
I'm just waiting for it to kick off.

13:25.638 --> 13:27.106
Everyone up.

13:30.376 --> 13:32.978
There might be a horrible atmosphere
between us

13:33.045 --> 13:35.014
but this is Tash on Tours,

13:35.080 --> 13:38.317
we've got to get the whole
of Newcastle necking on.

13:38.384 --> 13:42.321
Gary's got the keys for the boys
and Marnie's got locks for the girls

13:42.388 --> 13:44.390
Find your match, you have to kiss.

13:54.633 --> 13:57.770
I'm the only person
connecting the boys to the girls.

13:57.836 --> 14:01.440
I'm gonna sort it all out
and get Aaron to forgive Vicky.

14:07.646 --> 14:11.283
I'm begging Aaron to forgive Vicky,
but he's having none of it.

14:11.350 --> 14:14.954
I have no idea how this
is gonna get resolved.

14:17.089 --> 14:20.859
If I thought being in the house was
awkward, work just took the cake.

14:20.926 --> 14:25.764
Only way to get through this is to
get pissed and tash on with randoms.

14:27.132 --> 14:29.568
It just so happens,
the first person I see

14:29.635 --> 14:32.771
happens to be Justin Bieber's
younger brother.

14:36.809 --> 14:37.910
What am I playing at?

14:40.646 --> 14:42.514
I'm old enough to be his mam.

14:52.725 --> 14:55.728
We get to Tiger Tiger
and the atmosphere is still shit.

14:55.794 --> 14:58.931
All the tequila in Mexico
couldn't get us back together.

15:04.370 --> 15:05.804
I can't let this go.

15:05.871 --> 15:09.341
I know I should leave Aaron alone
and let him get over this,

15:09.408 --> 15:13.412
but I'm pissed and obnoxious
and I just wanna sort it out.

15:27.559 --> 15:32.965
Vicky is having no luck and now it's
my turn and I'm fucking dreading it.

15:41.373 --> 15:44.877
So, Holly didn't mean what she said
and she was just showing off.

15:44.943 --> 15:47.146
Course,
you're a sheep like the others.

15:53.952 --> 15:56.955
You're not winning me round, mate.
Fuck off.

15:57.823 --> 16:01.627
For a second I thought Aaron was
gonna make up with me, and he's not.

16:01.694 --> 16:04.563
I don't know what else I can do,
I'm so sorry.

16:16.575 --> 16:19.611
I'm sick of the boys
making the girls feel like shit.

16:19.678 --> 16:23.515
It's time to step in
and the lads to back the fuck off.

16:28.554 --> 16:30.656
That's me and the girls done.

16:30.723 --> 16:33.425
Best thing for them to do
is just fuck off.

16:34.026 --> 16:36.929
Enough of all this drama,
enough of Aaron fighting,

16:36.995 --> 16:40.366
we said he'd have a good night,
it's time to pull.

16:47.272 --> 16:50.342
I do think I done the right thing
by telling Gary to pull,

16:50.409 --> 16:53.946
but I never thought he'd do it
this soon and right in front of us.

16:54.012 --> 16:56.482
(Marnie screams)

16:56.548 --> 16:58.817
I'm absolutely mortal
and I can't cope.

16:58.884 --> 17:02.921
I've seen red so I grab the closest
thing and hoy it over Gary.

17:02.988 --> 17:04.723
That'll teach you, you prick.

17:07.960 --> 17:11.363
That chat with Marnie might as well
have never happened.

17:11.430 --> 17:15.099
Everything we agreed has gone out
the window and she's kicking off

17:15.166 --> 17:18.270
when I pull a bird after she told me
to go and pull birds.

17:23.575 --> 17:25.277
I wanna talk to Aaron,

17:25.344 --> 17:29.248
but for some reason it's coming out
in very shouty words.

17:34.720 --> 17:37.623
Tonight has just been
a massive disaster.

17:37.689 --> 17:41.827
The girls tried to apologise to Aaron
and they're still arguing.

17:41.894 --> 17:44.396
Marnie's pissed off cos I pulled.
Fuck it.

17:58.343 --> 18:02.147
One of the worst nights of my life.
Vicky's made a tit of herself.

18:02.214 --> 18:03.515
Fuck this, I'm off home.

18:10.155 --> 18:11.156
Aaron.

18:11.223 --> 18:15.527
We get home, all I wanna do is go to
bed but Vicky wants another round.

18:15.594 --> 18:17.229
Ding, ding, here we go again.

18:17.296 --> 18:20.999
Let him out, let him fucking
tell me what he thinks.

18:21.867 --> 18:24.503
Now! Now!

18:25.370 --> 18:29.441
You can scream in someone's face
for so long before something clicks,

18:29.508 --> 18:32.778
unfortunately me and Aaron
have gone past that point.

18:32.845 --> 18:35.981
I never closed the door on you.
Just go to bed.

18:36.048 --> 18:37.883
How dare you talk to me like that.

18:38.951 --> 18:42.087
I'm so, so drunk,
I'm misconstruing everything,

18:42.154 --> 18:44.923
getting the wrong end of the stick,
being a helmet.

18:44.990 --> 18:48.727
I wish I was at home with my ma.
This is shite. It's not.

18:48.794 --> 18:52.297
All this is, Marnie,
if you listen to yourself, is shite.

18:52.364 --> 18:54.399
I hate myself.

18:54.466 --> 18:57.536
Look, right, get in bed with her,
shite. No, you're...

18:57.603 --> 19:01.406
Get in bed with me, shite.
Get in bed with Holly, shite.

19:01.473 --> 19:03.909
Watch my face, shite.

19:03.976 --> 19:06.778
There's no other word for it,
it's absolutely shite.

19:06.845 --> 19:11.817
Oh, my God,
why is everyone so annoying?

19:11.884 --> 19:14.453
Right, Charlotte, I hate everyone.

19:14.520 --> 19:16.321
I hate everyone.

19:16.388 --> 19:20.092
Right, me and you,
let's go to sleep.

19:23.762 --> 19:27.866
Yes, Marnie pissed me off tonight,
but when she's being cute and funny,

19:27.933 --> 19:30.002
it's hard to stay angry at her.

19:30.068 --> 19:33.338
I thought watching Gary pull
would make us stop wanting him,

19:33.405 --> 19:37.676
but being drunk is making it hard to
resist, I can't stop the feelings.

19:38.477 --> 19:42.247
Surprise, surprise, me and Marnie
have been left alone two minutes

19:42.314 --> 19:44.850
and we're at it,
but I need to stay strong.

19:45.717 --> 19:50.689
I can't sleep with her, I can't
deal with them consequences.

20:08.674 --> 20:10.509
Last night was a total car crash,

20:10.576 --> 20:14.079
everyone hated each other
and today is gonna be so awkward.

20:17.516 --> 20:22.054
I hate this level of discord,
it's not nice. Morning. Morning.

20:22.120 --> 20:24.022
How are we?

20:24.089 --> 20:25.624
Are you all right?
No.

20:25.691 --> 20:27.426
I'm miserable.

20:27.492 --> 20:31.597
I feel so bad because I know
what I did was wrong.

20:31.663 --> 20:34.866
I'm gonna do now what I should've
done last night, avoid him.

20:34.933 --> 20:36.868
Did you shag Gary?
No.

20:36.935 --> 20:41.573
I was adamant I wasn't sleeping
with Gary after the way he went on.

20:41.640 --> 20:44.843
I'm proud of myself.
Gary tried it on and I said no,

20:44.910 --> 20:48.680
that's what I need to keep doing.
But it's so hard.

20:50.749 --> 20:52.317
How are Vicky and Marnie?

20:52.384 --> 20:56.521
Vicky's feeling bad, she's feeling
really bad. Bit awkward, innit?

20:56.588 --> 20:59.057
Last night was shit,
and Vicky ruined it.

20:59.124 --> 21:01.426
She can go and fuck herself.

21:03.128 --> 21:05.063
(phone rings)

21:05.530 --> 21:06.632
Hello.

21:07.966 --> 21:09.001
It's Scotty.

21:10.669 --> 21:11.703
OK.

21:12.871 --> 21:13.872
Mint, what is it?

21:16.575 --> 21:20.646
Wicked, see you in a bit. So Anna's
call was a Scottish hen party,

21:20.712 --> 21:22.648
hock aye the noo, woo.

21:22.714 --> 21:25.384
Anna rang, we're doing a bar crawl,
the lads.

21:25.450 --> 21:28.820
What, the lads just at work?
Fucking buzzing.

21:28.887 --> 21:31.690
Night off for the girls,
shall we do something nice?

21:31.757 --> 21:35.060
We should have a girly pamper
before we go out,

21:35.127 --> 21:38.196
like you know, do our nails,
have a glass of wine.

21:38.263 --> 21:41.933
While the lads work, the lasses will
take a bit of time for ourselves,

21:42.000 --> 21:45.303
just de-stress, chill out
and have a bit of a pamper sesh.

21:49.007 --> 21:52.811
No underpants, these hens will be
pulling it left, right and centre.

21:53.712 --> 21:55.614
Do I look proper Scottish, mate?

21:58.917 --> 22:01.787
They look a lot better
than what I first thought.

22:01.853 --> 22:06.358
Fuck me, we make these skirts look
good. We look like Scottish Vikings.

22:06.425 --> 22:08.360
We're fit in, er, kilts.

22:12.798 --> 22:16.068
He's fucking with me head,
I don't know what to do.

22:16.134 --> 22:17.736
(vomits)

22:17.803 --> 22:20.839
I've stood in Marnie's sick.
It stinks, man.

22:20.906 --> 22:22.040
Oi, oi.

22:22.107 --> 22:25.744
There's a new boy in the house.
What? Who the fuck is it?

22:25.811 --> 22:28.480
(all) Geordie Shore, whey-aye?

22:30.482 --> 22:30.682
.

22:33.285 --> 22:33.485
.

22:43.195 --> 22:48.333
I'm buzzing. Scottish hens know how
to party, I just hope they're fit.

22:50.068 --> 22:51.169
Hi!

22:52.003 --> 22:56.908
So, we get to the hen party and
we're a massive hit with the women.

23:02.714 --> 23:04.549
These birds aren't my cup of tea

23:04.616 --> 23:08.086
but we'll show them a good time,
pass the fucking ice.

23:15.994 --> 23:20.198
This hen party's loose as fuck.
They're all mortal, we're smashed,

23:20.265 --> 23:22.834
we need to find some birds
our own age.

23:27.806 --> 23:30.609
I'm pleased that the lads
are at work tonight,

23:30.675 --> 23:35.280
it gives me more time with the girls
I know we have to sort everything

23:35.347 --> 23:37.048
but I can't face it.

23:37.115 --> 23:40.986
Charlotte, stick your head in here.
Is it boiling? We've got it all.

23:41.052 --> 23:45.624
We've got face masks, we've got a
steaming machine, nail varnish,

23:45.690 --> 23:50.162
we've got candles,...
shit's about to get real.

23:50.228 --> 23:54.766
Ah, this is nice, a bit of girly
time. Yeah. Yeah, I'm liking this.

23:54.833 --> 23:56.535
Yeah, that's it, that's right.

23:56.601 --> 23:58.236
Here, I'll pat it down.

23:58.303 --> 23:59.538
You look beautiful.

23:59.604 --> 24:04.142
Holly looks like she's wearing
a baggy fanny on her face.

24:04.209 --> 24:05.610
What the hell?

24:05.677 --> 24:09.781
Anti-stress. Vicky, you need one
of these. You need anti-stress.

24:09.848 --> 24:12.484
You're stressed.
I know what this night needs now.

24:12.551 --> 24:16.288
I think there's some cucumber in the
fridge, I'm gonna check. OK, babe.

24:16.354 --> 24:20.125
I've seen in films you put cucumber
on your eyelids to do something

24:20.192 --> 24:24.362
with your bags, we've all got them
cos we never get any fucking sleep.

24:24.429 --> 24:27.465
No cucumber,
but there was some broccoli. OK.

24:27.532 --> 24:29.935
Can you put broccoli on your eyes?

24:30.001 --> 24:33.638
Well, I just thought maybe
you could do something like this.

24:34.873 --> 24:39.277
What on earth is the benefits of
putting this in your eye socket?

24:39.344 --> 24:43.381
Both green, both cold,
both do the job.

24:43.448 --> 24:47.018
I can't imagine what you're going
through's easy. I'm stressed.

24:47.085 --> 24:50.055
I've never gotten close
to anyone like Gary.

24:50.121 --> 24:52.724
Marnie is going through a hard time
with Gary.

24:52.791 --> 24:55.660
I am a fountain of knowledge
when it comes to this.

24:55.727 --> 24:58.730
Gary's not here, tell us
whatever you want. Exactly.

24:58.797 --> 25:02.300
But if I don't admit it
then it's not really true.

25:02.367 --> 25:06.538
I'm confused. If I did have feelings
it would only end in one way.

25:06.605 --> 25:08.907
At first I didn't have
feelings for him,

25:08.974 --> 25:12.210
but then when I've seen
the way he is it's like...

25:12.277 --> 25:15.614
You don't wanna admit it
cos you're afraid of getting hurt.

25:15.680 --> 25:17.983
Well, what would you do?
Me?

25:18.049 --> 25:21.219
Use what you've got, use what
women have that men don't.

25:21.286 --> 25:24.456
In this situation Marnie needs
to play to her strengths.

25:24.522 --> 25:27.092
She's sexy,
use that to her advantage.

25:27.158 --> 25:30.562
Manipulate him.
That's what women are best at.

25:30.629 --> 25:34.399
She'll have Gary eating out the palm
of her hand if she listens to me.

25:34.466 --> 25:36.334
That's what you would do?
Exactly.

25:36.401 --> 25:38.703
Right, I'm gonna really try.

25:38.770 --> 25:42.774
Tonight is stage one in operation
steal Gary's heart. If he has one.

25:48.113 --> 25:50.015
(chanting) Mortal, mortal.

25:56.554 --> 25:59.291
Work done, we're off to Riverside.

26:04.296 --> 26:07.465
Me and Marnie have ended things
and she's told me to pull.

26:07.532 --> 26:10.902
I'm gonna pull girls,
neck on with them in the club

26:10.969 --> 26:15.040
but not bring them back just yet,
it's like breaking her in gently.

26:18.543 --> 26:23.915
I look fit as fuck, there's no way
Gary's gonna resist us tonight.

26:25.250 --> 26:29.988
This shit with the lasses has gone
on long enough, time to make up.

26:48.373 --> 26:51.843
I go over to Vicky, give her
a cuddle, put it behind us.

26:53.912 --> 26:55.914
Now we can finally be friends again.

26:58.483 --> 27:02.220
Me and the girls are sorted. Now
I can go and do what's important.

27:02.287 --> 27:03.755
Where's the fucking fanny?

27:16.234 --> 27:18.603
Fucking hell,
mebbes I got me wingman back.

27:22.841 --> 27:26.878
I wish I hadn't have let the girls
make us think Gary might change.

27:26.945 --> 27:29.314
I should've just
stuck to me instincts.

27:35.487 --> 27:39.090
I can't believe that Gary's
kissing a girl in front of us.

27:39.157 --> 27:41.559
I didn't think it'd affect us,
but it has.

27:42.927 --> 27:46.965
I'm being nice by not banging someone
all I'm doing is necking on.

27:47.032 --> 27:48.533
I think that's thoughtful.

27:54.272 --> 27:57.642
Gary completely humiliated us
in front of everyone else.

27:57.709 --> 28:01.146
He's hurt us and I just don't know
how to cope with it.

28:02.447 --> 28:07.118
He's fucking with my head
and I don't know what to do, Vicky.

28:09.888 --> 28:11.256
Oh, my God.

28:14.759 --> 28:17.328
Gotta get her out
before she mugs herself off.

28:40.585 --> 28:42.387
(vomits) I'm in bed.

28:42.454 --> 28:46.825
And I'm mortal and again I'm spewing
up. Could tonight be any worse?

28:46.891 --> 28:47.892
Mmm.

28:48.893 --> 28:50.695
Are you OK down here?

28:52.530 --> 28:53.531
Right, OK.

28:56.067 --> 28:57.902
Thank you. Love you.
Love ya.

28:57.969 --> 29:01.840
What the fuck have I just stood on?
It's off for you now.

29:01.906 --> 29:05.376
I've stood in Marnie's sick. No.

29:05.443 --> 29:08.213
And it's all over my foot.
It stinks, man.

29:26.865 --> 29:30.902
Last night we went out, necked on
with birds, they kind of kicked off.

29:30.969 --> 29:34.906
Marnie told me to pull and to leave
her alone, so I'm gonna do that.

29:34.973 --> 29:39.444
If she wants to have a hissy fit
every time I pull then more fool her.

29:41.346 --> 29:44.315
She was spewing all over last night.
All over.

29:45.950 --> 29:50.488
Oh, God, what's got sick on and what
hasn't? Just there. I stood in that.

29:50.555 --> 29:54.292
On a scale of one to ten, Charlotte,
how pissed was I?

29:54.359 --> 29:57.629
You were crying,
saying you needed help.

29:57.695 --> 30:00.932
I've woke up feeling like shit.
I spewed up all night

30:00.999 --> 30:02.767
and Gary mugged us off again.

30:02.834 --> 30:06.771
I can't handle Gary. What you gonna
do? Are you not gonna speak to him?

30:06.838 --> 30:10.341
I can tell this is upsetting her.
I don't want her to go down

30:10.408 --> 30:14.145
the same path that I once did.
The path is shitty,

30:14.212 --> 30:17.649
it's muddy, there's shitloads
of puddles and no one ever

30:17.715 --> 30:21.386
remembers to wear wellies. Marnie
deserves a better path than that.

30:22.353 --> 30:23.388
Start afresh.

30:23.454 --> 30:27.258
Whatever it was that me and Gary
had, I spewed it up last night.

30:27.325 --> 30:28.793
It's with me sick.

30:32.664 --> 30:34.532
What do you wanna do tonight?

30:37.001 --> 30:41.472
I can't be arsed to be around Marnie.
We just wanna have some lad time.

30:48.479 --> 30:53.718
What is it? There's just, like,
a package with Charlotte on it.

30:53.785 --> 30:56.221
This is gonna be so good!

30:56.287 --> 30:58.056
How strange.

31:00.625 --> 31:03.661
This is something I've wanted
to get Charlotte for ages.

31:03.728 --> 31:05.964
I'm not telling her
it's from me though.

31:06.030 --> 31:08.099
This is called tight for life.

31:08.166 --> 31:12.170
For God's sake, I haven't got
a massive fanny, you know?

31:12.237 --> 31:14.639
Help with your
incontinence problems.

31:14.706 --> 31:18.843
Anything that limits the amount of
piss on the mattresses, I'm all for.

31:22.013 --> 31:24.816
No, you can't put it in the wee-hole.

31:24.882 --> 31:28.419
I'm getting confused, surely you'd
have to train the wee-hole.

31:28.486 --> 31:30.888
No, no, no, no, no, no.

31:30.955 --> 31:35.159
That's a tiny little hole. This is
definitely not going up there.

31:37.929 --> 31:40.832
Would you like a baggy T-shirt?
Maybe just some lube.

31:41.966 --> 31:45.003
Oh, my God.
I bet you say that to all the boys.

31:45.069 --> 31:46.604
(laughing) For God's sake.

31:46.671 --> 31:50.108
This isn't the strangest thing
I've done in front of the girls.

31:51.776 --> 31:53.444
Are you ready?

31:53.511 --> 31:55.747
I'm ready for the application.

31:57.448 --> 31:59.917
Oh, I feel like I'm having sex
in front of yous.

31:59.984 --> 32:02.920
Oh, my God, it's in.
(laughter)

32:02.987 --> 32:05.189
It just popped in.

32:05.256 --> 32:07.225
Let's get those muscles tightened.

32:07.292 --> 32:10.662
Squeeze, squeeze, squeeze.
Squeeze harder, harder, harder.

32:10.728 --> 32:13.264
All your pelvic floor.
Is it at the top?

32:13.331 --> 32:16.000
You're at the green!
All the way at the top!

32:16.067 --> 32:17.769
My fairy is immense.

32:17.835 --> 32:22.507
Char, you're doing so well, so well.
(pants) Well done.

32:22.573 --> 32:23.808
Oh, for God's sake.

32:23.875 --> 32:27.679
Have you got that up you?
Flex! (groans)

32:27.745 --> 32:29.881
Eh? I'm so confused.

32:29.947 --> 32:32.116
Now, now, now.
Flex! Flex!

32:32.183 --> 32:37.322
This is a serious medical procedure,
I don't want an audience, perverts.

32:37.388 --> 32:40.258
It's a vibrator?
No, it's not a vibrator.

32:40.325 --> 32:43.661
She's working on her pelvic floor.
OK. I understand.

32:43.728 --> 32:46.798
Ow, ow. Give it back!

32:46.864 --> 32:49.767
She's got your vagina on a lead.
(laughter)

32:54.172 --> 32:59.444
None of the lads want the girls
to know, so we're sneaking out.

32:59.510 --> 33:02.447
I'd still rather spend time
with the lads,

33:02.513 --> 33:05.350
so we're gonna get down
to Bijoux and fluff some muff.

33:11.089 --> 33:13.424
Let's go.

33:21.366 --> 33:24.736
Fucking mint. All four lads
getting along, a diamond of power

33:24.802 --> 33:26.771
and I'm at the top
cos I'm a pure prick.

33:26.838 --> 33:28.573
Boys' night!

33:29.307 --> 33:31.609
I knew I'd have a good time

33:31.676 --> 33:34.545
but I didn't think it'd be
this good, us lads get on

33:34.612 --> 33:37.882
and it feels like I've made
three new best mates.

33:42.353 --> 33:47.692
Yous aren't going
to fucking believe this. What?

33:47.759 --> 33:50.495
The lads aren't in.
Where they gone?

33:50.561 --> 33:52.397
Your guess is as good as mine.

33:52.463 --> 33:57.201
Vicky tells us the boys have snuck
out, pricks. Sneaky, snaky bastards.

33:57.268 --> 33:59.904
I'm really canny annoyed about it.
I am.

33:59.971 --> 34:04.642
We planned to do this back to them
and once again it's backfired.

34:04.709 --> 34:07.245
We're too sloth-like to be sneaky.
(laughter)

34:07.311 --> 34:09.847
Yeah, we need to be snaky,
not slothy.

34:09.914 --> 34:12.116
Nah, I say let's carry on
being slothy,

34:12.183 --> 34:16.587
let's order loads of food and lie
around in our jamas and stuff.

34:16.654 --> 34:22.159
Fuck this, the boys went out we're
gonna stay in, eat and get fat.

34:22.226 --> 34:27.165
I'll get some vodka, stuff myself
silly with honey chilli chicken.

34:27.231 --> 34:29.300
(doorbell rings)

34:29.367 --> 34:30.902
What's that noise?

34:30.967 --> 34:33.871
I'm lying in bed
and the doorbell goes.

34:36.574 --> 34:38.309
Oi, oi.

34:38.376 --> 34:39.744
What the hell?

34:41.746 --> 34:43.581
Oi, oi?

34:43.648 --> 34:44.882
What?

34:44.949 --> 34:46.583
Who the fuck is it?

34:46.650 --> 34:48.686
Oh, my God!

34:48.753 --> 34:51.656
There's a new boy in the house.
(laughs)

34:51.722 --> 34:55.126
Welcome to the Geordie Shore house.
Please enter here or here.

34:55.193 --> 34:58.262
And I can't fucking wait
to see Gary's reaction.

34:58.329 --> 35:01.766
If he tries to mug me off,
I'll make his life hell.

35:01.833 --> 35:03.901
What a good-looking bastard.

35:03.968 --> 35:06.938
My name's Kyle and I'm buzzing
to get this party started.

35:07.004 --> 35:09.874
(all) Geordie Shore, whey-aye?

35:11.676 --> 35:11.876
.

35:14.479 --> 35:14.679
.

35:24.889 --> 35:26.657
Your guess is as good as mine.

35:26.724 --> 35:32.063
Fuck this, the boys went out, we're
gonna stay in, eat and get fat.

35:32.129 --> 35:34.265
(doorbell rings)

35:34.332 --> 35:35.766
What's that noise?

35:35.833 --> 35:37.201
Oi, oi.

35:37.268 --> 35:38.436
What the hell?

35:39.570 --> 35:41.606
Oh, my God!

35:41.672 --> 35:45.676
There's a new boy in the house
and it's me best friend Kyle,

35:45.743 --> 35:48.846
I couldn't be happier.
You all right?

35:50.114 --> 35:51.549
Who the fuck is it?

35:53.050 --> 35:56.721
Me name's Kyle.
I'm a 21-year-old club promoter.

35:56.787 --> 36:00.758
I don't know what it is that lasses
like about us, it's just natural.

36:03.160 --> 36:04.161
Cheers, kid.

36:04.228 --> 36:06.898
I've necked on with Vicky,
kissed Charlotte

36:06.964 --> 36:09.200
and Marnie's like my little sister.

36:09.267 --> 36:12.503
And I'm buzzing to get
this party started. Hiya.

36:12.570 --> 36:15.606
Hi, Kyle. I walked into the house
and it looks like

36:15.673 --> 36:18.709
I interrupted a slumber party.
Where are the lads?

36:18.776 --> 36:21.879
What are you doing here?
Hiya. Housemate.

36:21.946 --> 36:23.014
Are you?
What?

36:23.080 --> 36:25.349
There's a new boy and he's fit.

36:25.416 --> 36:28.819
Welcome to the Geordie Shore house,
please enter here or here.

36:28.886 --> 36:31.689
We didn't expect this.
Eh? Didn't ya? No.

36:31.756 --> 36:35.126
It turns out that the new lad
is my old lad.

36:35.192 --> 36:37.962
I've been there before,
I wouldn't say no again.

36:38.029 --> 36:41.666
We're gaaning out now. The lasses
need to get their glad rags on

36:41.732 --> 36:44.735
because we're going out,
it's my first night.

36:44.802 --> 36:46.837
Let's fucking get our clothes on.

36:46.904 --> 36:48.839
Come on!
Howeh.

36:50.408 --> 36:53.678
You can't welcome someone
to the house with a takeaway,

36:53.744 --> 36:56.914
we've gotta go out, get mortal
and welcome him with vodka.

36:58.716 --> 37:02.086
She must have kissed him,
she's kissed everyone.

37:02.153 --> 37:05.456
She kissed you, she's obviously
kissed him. I've kissed him.

37:05.523 --> 37:09.226
I haven't. Have you? Never.
I'm getting fucking palpitations.

37:09.293 --> 37:12.863
Everyone is happy to see Kyle.
Me and Marnie are friends with him,

37:12.930 --> 37:15.266
Vicky still wants to
neck on with him

37:15.333 --> 37:18.169
and Holly can potentially
suck him off.

37:18.235 --> 37:19.904
He's like the perfect boy.

37:23.874 --> 37:27.445
I'm not being funny, but Kyle is
ten times better looking than Gary.

37:27.511 --> 37:30.781
We need to show him how to do it
Geordie Shore style

37:30.848 --> 37:32.717
and I need to be looking fit.

37:40.124 --> 37:43.294
We're gonna go meet
the rest of the boys

37:43.361 --> 37:47.798
with our new boy Kyle and I can't
fucking wait to see Gary's reaction.

37:47.865 --> 37:48.933
Cheers.

37:49.000 --> 37:50.001
Whoo!

38:02.747 --> 38:06.951
I don't know if the lasses will come
out. Fingers crossed they don't.

38:16.594 --> 38:21.098
The only person I see being pissed
off about Kyle's arrival is Gary,

38:21.165 --> 38:22.600
he'll hate competition.

38:31.308 --> 38:36.447
Oh, my God, we've just got to Bijoux
and Gary's just seen Kyle,

38:36.514 --> 38:38.549
his face is priceless.

38:38.616 --> 38:40.051
He's absolutely gutted.

38:41.686 --> 38:46.524
We're in Bijoux and the girls walk in
with a fucking new lad.

38:48.759 --> 38:51.228
I didn't realise
my dad was coming in.

38:52.730 --> 38:56.867
Finally someone nearly as massive as
me, sharesies on your clothes, mate.

38:57.735 --> 39:00.971
What a good-looking bastard,
I need to up me game.

39:12.116 --> 39:13.684
She'll be buzzing.
What?

39:15.786 --> 39:19.156
Marnie's buzzing that her friend's
walked through the door,

39:19.223 --> 39:23.928
I don't mind that. All I'm worried
about is if he tries to mug me off

39:23.994 --> 39:25.763
I'll make his life hell.

39:40.711 --> 39:42.346
Let's hope this kid's sound

39:42.413 --> 39:46.183
because the lads have done so well
to stay strong so far.

39:50.287 --> 39:54.358
I'm Marnie's best mate, doesn't mean
I'm gonna have a problem with Gary.

39:54.425 --> 39:57.027
If he hasn't got a problem,
I won't have one.

40:02.967 --> 40:05.970
Marnie's stressed because
Kyle's talking to Gary.

40:06.036 --> 40:08.706
She's desperate to keep them apart,
so I go over

40:08.773 --> 40:12.042
and try and break it up.
The next thing I know

40:12.109 --> 40:14.678
I'm breaking it up with my face,
necking on.

40:18.282 --> 40:21.886
Kyle's went in for a kiss, fucking
hell, he doesn't waste any time.

40:27.691 --> 40:31.028
Gary has this way to get
the boys on his side,

40:31.095 --> 40:34.532
and turn into him and Scott.
I won't let that happen to Kyle.

40:37.535 --> 40:40.571
I'm not here to play games,
I'm here to have a mint time

40:40.638 --> 40:42.239
and make some class friends.

40:45.376 --> 40:47.545
So we all welcome the new lad,

40:47.611 --> 40:50.714
now it's time for Tup Tup,
go fucking nuts.

40:59.056 --> 41:00.191
Yeah!

41:03.494 --> 41:05.663
I'm so happy Kyle and Vicky kissed.

41:05.729 --> 41:08.833
Kyle fancies her,
so that's a good thing.

41:11.769 --> 41:15.639
Gary's found out that Marnie doesn't
want Kyle and him getting close,

41:15.706 --> 41:18.008
now he's irritated
and I'm getting it.

41:27.184 --> 41:30.120
I can't believe how childish
Marnie's being,

41:30.187 --> 41:31.856
"Please don't talk to Gaz."

41:31.922 --> 41:35.226
We're not 12, Marnie,
he can make his own decisions.

41:43.133 --> 41:45.669
Tonight's been mint,
even Gary's sound with us.

41:45.736 --> 41:47.504
It's time to carry on the party.

42:02.686 --> 42:05.589
So we get back
and everyone's absolutely mortal.

42:13.197 --> 42:14.198
Brilliant.

42:19.069 --> 42:21.005
Scott, tell me that didn't hurt.

42:21.071 --> 42:25.442
There's only one way to end my first
night, hoy myself in the hot tub.

42:30.347 --> 42:33.450
It was a dream come true,
one of my best friends coming

42:33.517 --> 42:36.787
but now he's getting on with Gary
it's a nightmare.

42:52.269 --> 42:55.839
Kyle seems like a nice lad,
if Vicky hadn't already gone there

42:55.906 --> 42:58.909
and I wasn't sassy,
I would've sucked him off by now.

43:01.712 --> 43:04.214
I understand it's important
to Kyle to fit in.

43:04.281 --> 43:09.086
I just hope as time goes on,
I'm his priority and not the boys.

43:11.722 --> 43:14.892
I'm not getting drawn into
Marnie's games. They're friends

43:14.959 --> 43:18.629
but if Kyle wants to get on,
he needs to be with the lads.

43:21.265 --> 43:25.235
Frustrating how much I like Aaron, I
wish I hadn't gone there with Gary.

43:27.071 --> 43:28.739
Shall I build a time machine?

43:28.806 --> 43:30.841
Kyle's come in and I'm a slut again.

43:32.309 --> 43:33.610
Fucking mint.

43:33.677 --> 43:37.214
Tash on Tours, we're taking it
international. (cheering)

43:37.281 --> 43:39.183
Iceland, here we fucking go.

43:39.249 --> 43:42.252
There's girls on this arm, that arm.
Come on!

44:08.879 --> 44:09.079
.
