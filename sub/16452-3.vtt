00:59.430 --> 01:02.010
We never knew where the
shift Was gonna take us.

01:02.100 --> 01:03.650
But when it was done,

01:03.710 --> 01:07.310
I always had a hell of a
story And a good collar.

01:07.350 --> 01:10.920

shotgun With the apostles,

01:10.970 --> 01:14.000

02:41.790 --> 02:43.750
Fellas,until we find out Who she is

02:43.810 --> 02:46.440
And how she died,Those
steps are a crime scene.

02:46.510 --> 02:49.590
Fine,but there's no way We're letting
A 35-year veteran Of the force

02:49.600 --> 02:52.590
Lie on these steps While
you vacuum for fibers.

02:52.660 --> 02:53.760
Then what do you suggest?

02:53.770 --> 02:54.740
Here's what we're gonna do --

02:54.840 --> 02:57.920
We're gonna preserveWhat's left of ray's dignity
By finishing the burial

02:57.980 --> 02:59.690
And then bringing this
All back afterwards.

02:59.730 --> 03:03.920
Right now,Hodge's wife and kids
Are standing by an empty hole In the ground.

03:03.990 --> 03:06.700
Do you want them to come
Back here and witness this?

03:06.760 --> 03:09.470
Think,tao,think.

03:09.510 --> 03:11.040
Okay. You know what?

03:11.100 --> 03:12.390
You're officially outvoted.

So,put up the tape,cover the
Girl,do what you have to do,

03:15.590 --> 03:18.610
And then wait for provenza
And me to get back.

03:23.610 --> 03:25.710
Excuse me,gentlemen.

03:26.300 --> 03:27.350
How long will this take?

03:27.410 --> 03:30.170

03:33.890 --> 03:35.540
What is that

Listen,chief,provenza and
i Made a command decision

04:54.990 --> 04:56.540
That for the sake Of the family

04:56.590 --> 04:58.570
And out of respect For the deceased

04:58.650 --> 04:59.830
That the funeral Should continue.

04:59.910 --> 05:01.020
As soon As the family leaves,

05:01.080 --> 05:04.930
We'll haul hodge up And
do what needs to be done.

05:05.620 --> 05:08.780
You get that casket
back To where it was now,

05:08.840 --> 05:11.270
And i will deal With y'all later.

This is the last time
That i carpool with tao...

05:15.910 --> 05:17.600
Ever!

05:18.610 --> 05:20.490
The woman's body Was not embalmed.

05:20.530 --> 05:22.340
The coroner's investigator
Thinks she was suffocated,

05:22.400 --> 05:25.420
Possibly strangled,12 to 24 hours ago.

05:25.490 --> 05:27.360

Detective sanchez.

06:13.390 --> 06:16.740
The ceremony can proceed As planned
Using different entrances.

06:16.930 --> 06:18.940
-By the time you've Said "i do" 
-- Forget it.

06:19.020 --> 06:22.500
My guests are going up those
Stairs,through those doors.

06:22.510 --> 06:25.100
All right.  now i'm
ruining your wedding.

06:25.150 --> 06:27.070
You are under arrest For
obstruction of justice,

06:27.130 --> 06:28.460
Battery Of a
police officer --

06:28.970 --> 06:31.740
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

06:37.380 --> 06:38.610
Let me go!

06:42.580 --> 06:44.370
Daddy!

06:47.370 --> 06:48.810
Turn that camera off!

06:48.890 --> 06:50.430

06:50.470 --> 06:53.750
Get it! Get it! Get this! Get her!

06:55.170 --> 06:58.050
You shut down a church
And a funeral home.

06:58.120 --> 06:59.480
You arrested a bride.

06:59.530 --> 07:01.210
I did that groom A big favor.

07:01.270 --> 07:04.930
I'm sure,but his family Is in the lobby,
And they,surprisingly,Don't agree.

07:04.940 --> 07:08.110
The father of the bride,who
has Money coming out of his --

07:08.170 --> 07:10.100
Whatever,You
choose an orifice --

07:10.160 --> 07:12.070
Is threatening A major lawsuit.

07:12.110 --> 07:14.970
Ray hodge's relatives Are furious.

07:15.030 --> 07:17.980
And what could have been
Just a minor embarrassment

07:18.040 --> 07:19.780
Is now a complete disaster.

07:19.840 --> 07:21.710
Oh,and congratulations,Chief johnson.

07:21.770 --> 07:26.110
You've just become The most downloaded
Fully clothed woman On the internet.

07:27.150 --> 07:33.100
Now,if i am allowed to
talk To the pr-- i'm sorry.

07:33.200 --> 07:35.670
Chief pope,How is this my fault?

07:35.730 --> 07:38.770
Well,three words --
Flynn and provenza.

07:38.870 --> 07:42.100
Oh,god. Okay. Okay.

07:43.670 --> 07:45.950
Let's look At the bright side.

07:46.020 --> 07:49.400
When that naked woman popped
out Of ray hodge's casket,

07:49.480 --> 07:51.910
Flynn and provenza Exposed a murder

07:51.970 --> 07:55.010
That otherwise might
never Have come to light.

07:55.080 --> 07:59.030
And this business with the
bride Would have been far worse

07:59.090 --> 08:06.060
Had chief johnson actually
Done anything effectively To defend herself.

08:06.200 --> 08:08.150
When ms. Morgan Attacked me,

08:08.230 --> 08:11.250
I made a conscious
choice Not to respond.

08:11.300 --> 08:13.140
-Clearly.
- Okay.

08:13.210 --> 08:16.440
Let's just hope that
things Get better from here.

08:16.510 --> 08:18.560
And by "better," i mean
That you discover this body

08:18.610 --> 08:22.460
Has absolutely nothing
To do with the l.a.p.d.

08:25.850 --> 08:29.270
Commander.Chief pope.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.630
You got beaten up By a bride?

08:33.690 --> 08:35.799
I did not get beaten up.

08:35.870 --> 08:38.510
If i wanted to lay that spoiled
Brat out flat,i would have.

08:38.559 --> 08:40.950
Instead,i displayed
Professional restraint.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.039
Well,while you were
busy Pulling punches,

08:43.120 --> 08:45.290
You couldn't have Given me a call,
Let me know What was going on?

08:45.390 --> 08:48.940
I spent an hour waiting for
you In front of our new house.

08:49.000 --> 08:52.300
-What are you talking about?
-Brenda,This place is turnkey.

08:52.310 --> 08:54.140
It's halfway Between your job and mine.

08:54.200 --> 08:58.550
It's got three bedrooms,
Two baths,no stairs For visiting parents.

08:58.560 --> 09:01.770
But the realtor Says another couple
Is already writing an offer.

09:01.780 --> 09:03.730
So we need to Make a bid today.

09:03.810 --> 09:06.740
There's no way i'm getting
out Of here to look at a house.

09:06.820 --> 09:09.510
What is so pressing you
can't Get away from the office

09:09.570 --> 09:12.310
For one hour On a sunday afternoon?

09:24.710 --> 09:26.850
?????

09:26.910 --> 09:30.050
Ray hodge left the force and
Became a private investigator.

09:30.170 --> 09:32.700
Our unidentified victim
Might have something to do

09:32.780 --> 09:35.440
With one of the cases
He was working on or not.

09:35.490 --> 09:38.900
Do you think ray's widow Will give 
us a problem,Handing over his files?

09:38.930 --> 09:40.810
Maggie? Nah,she'll cooperate.

09:40.860 --> 09:44.230
Yeah,but if ray kept His paperwork as a p.i. 
The same way he did as a cop,

09:44.600 --> 09:49.050
Only thing you're gonna find In those 
files Are racing forms And takeout menus.

09:49.060 --> 09:52.110
I'm not gonna deny ray had
A reputation as a womanizer.

09:52.170 --> 09:54.080
-And drinker. 
-And a gambler.

09:54.100 --> 09:56.070
Okay. Off-hours.

09:56.130 --> 09:58.470
On-duty,He was one of the good guys.

09:58.520 --> 10:00.290
Anything we find Will back that up.

10:00.370 --> 10:02.240
And how do we deal With the autopsy?

10:02.300 --> 10:04.780
Dr. Crippen is working
up The bodies right now.

10:04.840 --> 10:07.710
No sign of sexual
assault On our jane doe.

10:07.770 --> 10:09.950
Okay. And the wife?

10:10.000 --> 10:13.860
-I put ray hodge's widow In your office.
-I can see that,detective,yes.

10:13.870 --> 10:15.740
She didn't know about
The naked,dead chick

10:15.820 --> 10:18.500
Falling out of her husband's
Coffin until i told her.

10:18.560 --> 10:20.370
She's a little Bent out of shape.

10:20.430 --> 10:22.140
uh,chief?

10:22.220 --> 10:25.230
Me and provenza have a long
History with maggie hodge,

10:25.310 --> 10:26.720
So maybe we Should go in first

10:26.800 --> 10:30.250
-And sort of Smooth things over.
-All right. All right. Go,go,go. Please.

10:35.200 --> 10:37.570
Detective daniels,what do
we Know about the mortuary?

10:37.640 --> 10:41.420
Sheffield and eckhart Is one 
of the oldest Funeral homes in town.

10:41.590 --> 10:43.220
Edward eckhart,the owner,

10:43.280 --> 10:46.060
Nearly broke down on the phone
When i described what happened.

10:46.120 --> 10:49.480
He also asked About a dozen times
If we could keep this Out of the press.

10:49.480 --> 10:52.190
Eckhart faxed a list Of employees.

10:53.110 --> 10:55.820
Oh,for heaven's sakes!

10:57.050 --> 11:00.310
I couldn't even get him In the ground
Without you Making excuses for him!

11:00.320 --> 11:01.020
Lieutenant flynn!

11:01.100 --> 11:03.650
What are you yelling at me
for? She started slapping me.

11:03.710 --> 11:05.980
Yeah,she really kind of did,Chief.

11:06.300 --> 11:10.640
Let go. Let go. Let go.
Get out!

11:12.980 --> 11:15.830
-It's so unfair.
-Oh,yes,it is.

11:16.030 --> 11:18.880
-So unfair.
-It's so unfair.

11:20.060 --> 11:25.470
My sincere condolences On your loss.

11:26.030 --> 11:28.910
You mean my embarrassment.

11:29.800 --> 11:33.700
Rotten son of a bitch.

11:38.190 --> 11:41.230
Ma'am,would you like To sit down?

11:47.640 --> 11:52.430
Mrs. Hodge,When your husband passed,
We assumed it was From natural causes.

11:52.440 --> 11:55.810
But with recent
events,We have to wonder.

11:55.870 --> 11:57.740
Did anyone want him dead?

11:57.820 --> 12:00.090
More than me?

12:00.440 --> 12:03.600
Oh,i seriously doubt that.

12:05.180 --> 12:11.010
Here is a picture Of the woman
Who was in the casket With your husband.

12:11.020 --> 12:14.890
Does she look at all... Familiar?

12:18.780 --> 12:23.470
Blond,big tits,Blank expression.Yeah,

12:23.530 --> 12:24.930
that was ray's type.

12:24.990 --> 12:29.100
Do you think he might have
been Involved with her?

12:29.150 --> 12:32.300
With ray's heart,He
couldn't raise a flag.

12:32.380 --> 12:34.890
And viagra Would have been suicide.

12:34.930 --> 12:37.010
Mrs. Hodge,we understand
For the past several years

12:37.060 --> 12:39.720
Mr. Hodge has been working
As a private investigator.

12:39.800 --> 12:43.050
Would you object to us
Looking over his files?

12:43.110 --> 12:45.760
Sure. Why not? What do i care?

12:45.820 --> 12:47.730
Thank you,mrs. Hodge.

12:47.790 --> 12:50.730
And as soon as the coroner
Has finished with his autopsy,

12:50.780 --> 12:55.340
I'll have mr. Hodge's body
Returned to you for reburial.

12:55.400 --> 12:56.910
Don't bother.

12:56.970 --> 12:59.280
As far as i'm
concerned,You can burn him.

12:59.340 --> 13:02.420
And i'm not talking Some
fancy cremation,either.

13:02.460 --> 13:07.320
I'm talking gasoline,Paint thinner...

13:07.400 --> 13:10.200
And strike a match.

13:18.500 --> 13:21.690
We've gone over the full list
Of funeral-home employees,

13:21.770 --> 13:23.400
And no one Has a criminal record.

13:23.440 --> 13:25.510
Well,just because they
don't Have criminal records

13:25.560 --> 13:26.860
Doesn't mean They don't commit crimes.

13:26.900 --> 13:29.470
Edward eckhart,our
esteemed Funeral-home owner,

13:29.540 --> 13:31.960
Is awaiting you In interview 1.

13:34.450 --> 13:36.320
Why haven't these people
Been taken to a holding cell?

13:36.390 --> 13:37.930
I specifically asked
That they remain here

13:37.990 --> 13:40.680
Until we made a good-faith
Effort to resolve the situation.

13:40.710 --> 13:44.790
Well,i arrested them.
Situation resolved.

13:50.630 --> 13:55.970
I am looking for Some
instant shut up! Now!

14:00.960 --> 14:03.690
Ms. Morgan,over the last
hour,Our attorneys have assured me

14:03.730 --> 14:06.530
That you and your family have
No grounds for a civil lawsuit.

14:06.590 --> 14:10.430
In fact,Your own videographer's footage
Is all the evidence we need

14:10.440 --> 14:13.490
To file criminal charges
Against you and your father

14:13.550 --> 14:16.620
For obstruction of justice,
Interfering With a murder investigation,

14:16.630 --> 14:18.680
And battery Against a police officer.

14:18.760 --> 14:21.760
I barely touched That bitch.

14:23.670 --> 14:27.100
I consider it a great shame That 
what might have been An amusing anecdote

14:27.120 --> 14:30.660
For a 50th wedding anniversary
Somehow devolved into a riot.

14:30.720 --> 14:32.900
I also view chief johnson
As the injured party here,

14:32.950 --> 14:37.560
So i will defer To her wishes As to 
how we might Best resolve this situation.

14:37.650 --> 14:39.910
Oh.

14:39.940 --> 14:42.430
Well,um...

14:42.500 --> 14:45.960
This has been a tough day For everyone.

14:46.020 --> 14:53.120
So,if y'all Will sign releases,
Abandoning plans For civil action,I will...

14:53.130 --> 14:55.610
drop the charges,And
y'all can go home.

14:55.660 --> 14:58.270
W-w-who's gonna reimburse me
For the cost of this wedding?

14:58.320 --> 15:01.230
This woman is the caterer.
Her bill alone is $30,000.

15:01.280 --> 15:04.560
A number which will pale In comparison
To the bill your lawyers Will send you

15:04.570 --> 15:07.400
For suing us on charges
You cannot possibly win.

15:07.460 --> 15:10.180
This offer is in effect
For the next 10 seconds.

15:10.240 --> 15:12.300
Yes or no?

15:12.350 --> 15:16.630
I will never,ever,ever Sign a release.

15:16.690 --> 15:19.970
Not only that,But when
i'm done suing you,

15:20.030 --> 15:25.000
I'm gonna take The city's millions
And have the most beautiful Wedding ever.

15:28.430 --> 15:32.200
Officers,will you take The
bridal party to booking now?

15:32.270 --> 15:34.630
Oh,no. Okay.

15:34.690 --> 15:38.610
If you want to send A gift,
I'll be registered At merrill lynch.

15:40.160 --> 15:43.070
Daniels,before i talk to the
Director of this funeral home,

15:43.150 --> 15:46.620
I need to take a look At their finances.
So,thank you.

15:46.750 --> 15:49.340
Uh,miss caterer?

15:49.760 --> 15:54.330
Really would be a shame to
let All that food go to waste.

15:54.370 --> 15:55.440
Well,it happens.

15:55.510 --> 16:00.440
I just usually donate
it To the less fortunate.

16:04.520 --> 16:06.040
Good afternoon,Mr. Eckhart.

16:06.110 --> 16:09.150
I'm deputy chief Brenda
leigh johnson,l.a.p.d.

16:09.200 --> 16:11.500
So sorry we had to
shut down Your mortuary.

16:11.580 --> 16:13.420
I understand someone has
already Read you your rights?

16:13.460 --> 16:15.170
Yes,yes. Yes,they have.

16:15.240 --> 16:17.960
Dear god. Am i being
arrested For something?

16:18.020 --> 16:21.220
-Not necessarily,sir.
-That's not no. That's not a no.

16:21.270 --> 16:23.140
Well,i can't say What
will happen here today

16:23.200 --> 16:26.990
Until you can explain Why there were 
two bodies Shoved together In one coffin.

16:27.060 --> 16:31.720
That casket left my funeral Parlor 
with one body in it -Only one,i swear.

16:31.790 --> 16:33.640
And how can you Be sure of that,sir?

16:33.730 --> 16:39.200
At sheffield and eckhart,I'm
what's known as the closer.

16:39.260 --> 16:40.120
Excuse me?

16:40.180 --> 16:42.500
I'm the last person To view the body,

16:42.540 --> 16:45.000
And then i close the coffin. Tight.

16:45.050 --> 16:47.370
And why on earth would i
put One body in with another?

16:47.430 --> 16:50.610
Sheffield and eckhart Makes money
From every casket That we sell.

16:50.620 --> 16:52.610
Perhaps you were offered A little 
extra cash To get rid of a corpse

16:54.210 --> 16:57.020
-That couldn't be disposed of Legitimately.
-We don't say "corpse."

16:57.090 --> 17:01.050
We say "loved one" Or "deceased."

17:01.890 --> 17:04.790
And,no,i've never seen
her Before in my life.

17:04.839 --> 17:07.839
If you dump a murder victim
In someone else's casket,

17:07.900 --> 17:09.740
The crime disappears
Into the ground forever.

17:09.810 --> 17:10.800
I hear it happens All the time.

17:10.859 --> 17:11.980
It doesn't happen All the time.

17:12.030 --> 17:15.130
It never happens! Never at
Sheffield and eckhart! Never!

17:15.190 --> 17:18.550
For over a hundred years,Our
mortuary's public face

17:18.630 --> 17:22.530
Has been without blemish,And now...

17:23.630 --> 17:28.150
Today we may have lost
Something invaluable --

17:28.220 --> 17:31.500
Our unique reputation.

17:31.550 --> 17:34.240
And that would be?

17:34.300 --> 17:35.900
Sheffield and eckhart Is known

17:35.970 --> 17:39.580
For how we prepare The
dearly departed for viewing.

17:39.630 --> 17:40.930
Our pledge --

17:40.990 --> 17:45.150
To make the deceased look As
good as they've ever looked.

17:45.210 --> 17:47.400
We never cut corners,Even
if it means hiring

17:47.410 --> 17:50.410
The most talented and
Expensive team of experts.

17:50.470 --> 17:52.150
I'd like to know About them,sir.

17:52.220 --> 17:53.740
I would also like the names of Everyone

17:53.840 --> 17:56.210
with access to the home 
For the past five years

17:56.260 --> 18:00.870
Especially any employee with a
Penchant for naked,dead women.

18:00.930 --> 18:04.400
I also want the names On every 
guest book For the past five days,

18:04.440 --> 18:06.510
Because i think a visitor may
Have come through the front door

18:06.570 --> 18:07.840
And left through the back.

18:07.920 --> 18:12.430
I also will not hesitate To exhume 
every one Of your clients buried --

18:12.470 --> 18:13.670
Oh!

18:15.860 --> 18:17.900
Ohh!

18:18.850 --> 18:23.180
Yeah,hi. We need a
janitor In interview 1.

18:25.180 --> 18:27.020
Bring a mask.

18:30.100 --> 18:31.850
hodge was On
three heart medications.

18:31.890 --> 18:34.470
I'm waiting for a tissue
Diagnosis,but i have no doubt

18:34.510 --> 18:37.460
He died from a lifetime
Of eating fried food.

18:37.500 --> 18:41.030
Now,as for your jane doe,The
hyoid bone above the larynx

18:41.060 --> 18:42.890
Was broken and detached From the skull,

18:42.930 --> 18:45.840
Suggesting she was strangled
With significant force.

18:45.900 --> 18:48.460
But i think you're gonna find
This of even more interest.

18:48.500 --> 18:51.520
Chin implants,cheek
implants,Rhinoplasty,

18:51.560 --> 18:53.950
Dental veneers,Collagen in the lips,

18:54.030 --> 18:57.650
Not to mention a tummy
tuck And butt augmentation.

18:57.690 --> 18:59.340
Is that a lot?

18:59.380 --> 19:01.380
Even by l.a. Standards.

19:01.420 --> 19:04.240
Judging by these incisions,Most,if
not all,of the work

19:04.340 --> 19:07.250
Was done Within the past 18 months.

19:07.310 --> 19:11.540
Hmm. So this is probably not The way
 her face looks On her driver's license.

19:11.550 --> 19:13.710
But the good news is

19:13.760 --> 19:18.140
I can tell you Who our jane doe is.

19:18.180 --> 19:22.400
These are Her breast implants,
Which include serial numbers

19:22.430 --> 19:25.510
Which allow you to trace
them Back to the surgeon.

19:25.570 --> 19:27.780
Deputy chief johnson,

19:27.820 --> 19:34.680
Meet ms. Allergan
A-y-14-7-8-9.

19:50.230 --> 19:53.190
My schedule is Slightly
screwed up today.

19:53.250 --> 19:54.620
-Doctor -
- No,no,please. Don't get up.

19:54.690 --> 19:56.590
Let me just take a
look At you right here.

19:56.610 --> 19:59.300
The lighting where you're
Sitting is specifically designed

19:59.380 --> 20:01.900
To highlight every element Of your face.

20:01.950 --> 20:04.050
-Doctor 
-- No,no,Don't say anything else.

20:04.080 --> 20:05.580
This is the fun part.

20:05.660 --> 20:09.320
I always like To guess why...

20:09.380 --> 20:11.800
It's your mouth,isn't it?

20:11.860 --> 20:14.140
You know,i might be costing
Myself some serious money here,

20:14.200 --> 20:17.760
But i think the problem
Might just be your lipstick.

20:17.840 --> 20:18.660
Excuse me?

20:18.730 --> 20:21.770
U know my wife always tells me that
i'm Too blunt with the patients,

20:21.830 --> 20:25.590
But between the color and The
way you're slathering it on,

20:25.650 --> 20:28.080
It's making your mouth Look huge.

20:28.120 --> 20:32.060
Doctor,i'm not here
About my...giant mouth.

20:32.120 --> 20:35.820
I'm here About breast implants.

20:35.860 --> 20:37.710
Really?

20:37.770 --> 20:41.540
Okay,well,how much
bigger Do you want to be?

20:41.580 --> 20:43.160
Not implants for me.

20:43.230 --> 20:46.890
Implants the manufacturer
Says that you

20:46.950 --> 20:50.180
purchased That were removed From
a dead woman's body.

20:50.220 --> 20:53.240
You need to tell us Who she was.

20:55.630 --> 21:01.190
Oh.This is almost always A very bad way
To have these implants Returned.

21:01.200 --> 21:03.600
Let me just,uh...

21:03.650 --> 21:07.040
Take a look At the numbers here.

21:08.990 --> 21:12.270
Oh,no,this is terrible.

21:12.340 --> 21:14.050
Sue emery.

21:14.110 --> 21:15.030
What happened?

21:15.090 --> 21:16.520
What can you tell us About her?

21:16.600 --> 21:20.470
Lovely young lady. Aspiring actress.
 Perfect patient.

21:20.520 --> 21:21.410
How's that?

21:21.470 --> 21:24.420
Well,she healed with no keloids
And virtually no scarring.

21:24.480 --> 21:25.530
She's a surgeon's dream.

21:25.610 --> 21:28.590
And,please,look at this face.
That is a natural beauty.

21:28.640 --> 21:31.430
Would you describe sue
emery As a surgery addict?

21:31.480 --> 21:35.250
No. Definitely not.
No,for an addict,It never ends.

21:35.260 --> 21:38.550
For sue,after we did
Her eyelid reshaping,

21:38.600 --> 21:39.960
We both agreed She was done.

21:40.020 --> 21:44.330
Any idea How an aspiring actress 
Acquired the money to pay For all this work?

21:44.340 --> 21:48.180
No,but she always Paid
in cash in advance.

21:48.260 --> 21:51.300
All right,well,Thank you very much.

21:51.380 --> 21:53.390
We'll just take a copy
Of her files with us.

21:53.470 --> 21:55.560
Oh,um,i'm sorry.

21:55.620 --> 21:58.320
My policy is that patient
files Never leave the office.

21:58.400 --> 22:01.840
Doctor-client privilege expires
With the patient's death.

22:01.920 --> 22:04.090
Detective,I attend to major movie stars

22:04.190 --> 22:08.530
And practically every Prominent family
From pacific palisades To hancock park.

22:08.600 --> 22:11.740
Now,if it was to get out That their 
cosmetic work Might be revealed,

22:11.750 --> 22:13.340
My business Would be irreparably harmed.

22:13.400 --> 22:17.040
-I'm sure You understand this.
-I do. I do.

22:17.170 --> 22:20.590
And if i need to,i will have a
Detective return with a warrant.

22:20.640 --> 22:23.560
I'm sure you understand.

22:29.220 --> 22:32.540
so far we can't find
Anyone other than the mortician

22:32.600 --> 22:35.180
Or the widow who might have had
Access to ray hodge's coffin.

22:35.240 --> 22:37.030
Okay. What about his office?

22:37.090 --> 22:40.280
Well,there's no time sheets,But
ray did leave three years

22:40.330 --> 22:43.720
Of insider's betting digest,
Pro and college editions.

22:43.760 --> 22:46.240
"p.s. Agreed To payment terms."

22:46.280 --> 22:48.030
But we don't have the
rest Of the stupid letter.

22:48.070 --> 22:51.260
What did the doctor say,Chief?

22:51.340 --> 22:55.590
Um,our victim's name is,Uh,sue emery,

22:55.610 --> 22:58.970
But that name Might be as contrived 
As everything else about her.

22:58.990 --> 23:01.690
I'll start A financial work-up.

23:01.750 --> 23:03.500
Sue emery. Here she is.

23:03.560 --> 23:07.830
Six weeks ago,A complaint was filed
Against sue emery For extortion.

23:07.830 --> 23:10.230
The alleged victim?

23:10.280 --> 23:11.030
Raymond hodge.

23:11.110 --> 23:13.440
That's our connection.
Emery was blackmailing hodge.

23:13.510 --> 23:18.390
Chief,ray hodge's calendar Has 
repeated references To a john and pictures.

23:18.450 --> 23:20.140
If sue emery Was a call girl

23:20.200 --> 23:22.190
And she had photos of
herself And a client,

23:22.270 --> 23:23.550
That could be the extortion.

23:23.590 --> 23:26.930
It might explain why she was
Paying for her surgery in cash.

23:27.010 --> 23:29.500
Only if hodge Was the
one being extorted,

23:29.580 --> 23:31.680
He wouldn't refer to
himself As "the john."

23:31.760 --> 23:33.370
And according to his wife,

23:33.410 --> 23:37.010
Ray's picking up a hooker would
Have been a form of suicide.

23:37.070 --> 23:39.950
Uh,who was The reporting officers?

23:41.690 --> 23:44.510
Lieutenant tao?

23:51.470 --> 23:54.470
All right.All right,now.

23:54.510 --> 23:57.310
Don't jump To any conclusions.

23:57.410 --> 24:00.290
It was all his fault.

24:00.350 --> 24:04.650
You knew that ray hodge was
Being extorted by our victim,

24:04.700 --> 24:05.690
And you said nothing?!

24:05.730 --> 24:07.320
No,no. Now,chief,listen.

24:07.390 --> 24:09.300
We filed that report,

24:09.370 --> 24:11.770
But we never connected
Our jane doe with sue emery

24:11.830 --> 24:14.950
Because we never Saw sue emery before.

24:15.030 --> 24:18.890
Yeah,chief,actually,The first t
ime we ever Laid eyes on sue emery

24:18.890 --> 24:21.630
Was when she rolled out
Of ray's casket,okay?

24:21.690 --> 24:24.710
-So now we're all On the same page.
-Yeah. Go back a chapter.

24:24.950 --> 24:27.030
How did you two Get involved in this?

24:27.090 --> 24:28.630
Th-th-the
short version.

24:28.670 --> 24:30.030
Okay.

24:30.610 --> 24:33.490
So,ray calls flynn A month back.

24:33.560 --> 24:36.300
-No,it was six weeks.
-Whatever.

24:36.310 --> 24:40.960
So,anyway.Ray calls flynn,and he says
That he's being extorted

24:41.040 --> 24:42.300
By this sue emery Character.

24:42.380 --> 24:45.000
So we thought one of ray's
Clients was being extorted.

24:45.080 --> 24:48.480
And ray didn't want us to
know Who he was representing.

24:48.540 --> 24:50.690
-But if you look 
-- Ah! Ah!

24:50.720 --> 24:53.770
We decided To go with what ray said.

24:53.820 --> 24:55.980
Because it's illegal For
the l.a.p.d.

24:56.080 --> 24:58.510
To run platesOr pull addresses For
a private investigator.

24:58.550 --> 25:04.290
But if An ex-l.a.p.d. Officer,
Like your friend ray hodge,

25:04.300 --> 25:07.500
Pretended that sue emery
Was blackmailing him...

25:07.550 --> 25:11.260
Okay,i know this sounds like
We're in a gray area,chief,

25:11.340 --> 25:15.320
But the good news is we already
Know a lot about our victim.

25:15.380 --> 25:18.220
Like...like,uh...

25:18.260 --> 25:20.470
-Like where she lived.
-Right. Nichols canyon.

25:20.480 --> 25:23.610
And she had a partner She
was working with sometimes

25:23.670 --> 25:25.180
And dating maybe.

25:25.260 --> 25:26.880
Scott something.

25:26.930 --> 25:27.810
Hauser. Scott hauser.

25:27.880 --> 25:30.510
Has a criminal record -- beat
up One of his ex-girlfriends.

25:30.580 --> 25:33.510
So,who was ray's client?

25:33.570 --> 25:34.620
The one Who was being extorted,

25:34.690 --> 25:40.440
The one for whom mr. Hodge Substituted 
his own name In that bogus Criminal report?

25:40.450 --> 25:42.980
-Not a clue.
- Honestly.

25:45.110 --> 25:46.460
All right,you two.

25:46.500 --> 25:50.380
Go find this scott hauser
Character and bring him in now.

25:51.510 --> 25:53.850
And if i find out
That you have held back

25:53.910 --> 25:58.130
One teensy,itsy-bitsy
speck Of information --

25:58.190 --> 25:59.640
Chief,i know you're upset,

25:59.700 --> 26:01.590
But nobody wants to clear
This up more than i do.

26:01.670 --> 26:03.990
Ray was a great guy,And
he shouldn't be remembered

26:04.040 --> 26:06.790
For falling out of a
coffin With a blond bimbo.

26:06.850 --> 26:10.800
I'd like to see the man Ushered out 
of this world With the proper respect.

26:10.940 --> 26:15.100
Chief,if it weren't for
me Dropping that casket,

26:15.210 --> 26:18.710
We wouldn't even know
That this was a murder.

26:18.770 --> 26:24.150
And i wouldn't be a defendant In a massive 
lawsuit Brought on by a snobby bride.

26:25.500 --> 26:30.740
Or the number-one download On youtube!

26:30.800 --> 26:33.800
Talk about your glass Half-empty.

26:38.190 --> 26:40.440
So,the doorbell rings.

26:40.520 --> 26:44.350
Sue emery gets out of the
shower And goes to answer it,

26:44.430 --> 26:48.560
And she opens it up enough For t
he killer To break through the chain,

26:48.570 --> 26:50.530
And he attacks her
here,Where the towel falls.

26:50.580 --> 26:53.170
If the murder is the
john She was extorting,

26:53.220 --> 26:56.660
Maybe he ransacks the
place For his photos.

26:56.730 --> 27:00.600
This place rents For $6,000 a month?

27:01.650 --> 27:06.650
That's like...$8 an hour.

27:06.710 --> 27:10.710
Considering sue emery hadn't
Filed a w-2 in five years,

27:10.820 --> 27:15.270
She must have been doing Something 
lucrative on the side To pay for all of this.

27:17.840 --> 27:20.070
Oh,hi. Look here.

27:20.150 --> 27:23.230
Assuming the killer Dumped this out,

27:23.310 --> 27:26.860
You'd expect to find
prints Inside -- here,here.

27:26.940 --> 27:28.400
Unh-unh. Wiped clean.

27:28.450 --> 27:30.860
Doesn't mean the killer's
prints Aren't in the house,

27:30.930 --> 27:34.670
But if they are,they weren't
Left during the murder.

27:35.170 --> 27:39.530
Well,i guess we know Where the blanket
The body was wrapped up in Came from.

27:43.340 --> 27:48.010
How can people afford
to live In los angeles?

27:51.230 --> 27:52.880
Oh.

27:55.480 --> 27:57.800
Detective,what do you
think Of my lipstick?

27:57.880 --> 28:02.900
Are you asking me as
A friend or the chief?

28:02.960 --> 28:04.670
Why didn't you ever Say anything?

28:04.710 --> 28:08.640
Same reason i never said
Anything about your sweaters.

28:13.290 --> 28:15.210
Uh...

28:20.140 --> 28:23.000
We found scott hauser Sitting 
in his apartment,Watching a ballgame.

28:23.000 --> 28:27.970
Now,we ran his prints On file Against 
the ones that tao found In sue emery's house,

28:28.010 --> 28:30.320
-And they match.
-And you read mr. Hauser His rights?

28:30.350 --> 28:32.920
He's waiting In interview room 2.

28:33.000 --> 28:36.320
You still don't want to
go Into interview room 1.

28:39.880 --> 28:41.860
I'm deputy chief Brenda johnson,

28:41.940 --> 28:44.100
But no need to introduce
Yourself,mr. Hauser,

28:44.180 --> 28:45.490
'Cause i feel like I already know you.

28:45.570 --> 28:47.290
Yeah? Why is that,chief johnson?

28:47.380 --> 28:51.880
This afternoon,I found your fingerprints
All over the house Of a murder ctim.

28:52.080 --> 28:55.230
Your girlfriend,Sue emery.

29:05.960 --> 29:10.350
Nothing tastes better than
Somebody else's wedding cake.

29:10.780 --> 29:13.730
Mine tasted Like prison food.

29:15.010 --> 29:19.700
Chief johnson Is interviewing the killer
Of hodge's casket mate.

29:19.990 --> 29:22.460
And is that What i think it is?

29:22.520 --> 29:25.980
Mm-hmm. Want some?

29:27.240 --> 29:30.290
Does this case have anything
To do with the l.a.p.d.?

29:30.350 --> 29:31.140
No.

29:31.200 --> 29:33.970
Then,yeah,give me a big
piece From the corner.

29:34.050 --> 29:38.980
Look,i'd never kill sue.

29:40.030 --> 29:44.690
I know you guys automatically
Suspect boyfriends,

29:44.750 --> 29:53.010
But,you see,My relationship with her
Was more like a manager.

29:53.060 --> 29:57.010
Oh,is that what It's called nowadays?

29:57.060 --> 29:59.190
Her literary manager. Yeah.

29:59.250 --> 30:00.670
Sue emery was an author?

30:00.730 --> 30:04.800
Yes. See,she came to me with
A book that she wanted to shop.

30:04.860 --> 30:08.560
This book -- this book was worth
Probably millions of dollars.

30:08.630 --> 30:10.980
Really? A-and what was it about?

30:11.040 --> 30:13.310
Um...

30:14.260 --> 30:16.780
No,i-i can't tell you that.

30:16.840 --> 30:18.430
Ah.

30:20.280 --> 30:23.280
And where is it,then,This book?

30:24.060 --> 30:26.440
I don't know exactly.

30:26.520 --> 30:29.160
Okay.So,um,just to summarize --

30:29.180 --> 30:32.260
You did not kill sue
emery Over a priceless book

30:32.320 --> 30:33.650
That you cannot discuss Or locate?

30:33.720 --> 30:37.170
That should play real well with
The jury at your murder trial.

30:37.250 --> 30:41.780
Okay,uh,mr. Hauser,Pretend
that i am the d.a.

30:41.830 --> 30:46.100
I suggest that sue emery
Was some kind of call girl,

30:46.160 --> 30:52.440
A high-priced prostitute who Possessed 
compromising photos Of herself with some client.

30:52.450 --> 30:55.740
Perhaps as her...manager,

30:55.810 --> 30:59.450
You helped her pick some
High-value john to blackmail.

30:59.530 --> 31:01.760
Maybe you even took
part In the shakedown.

31:01.840 --> 31:04.600
And after she collected The money,

31:04.660 --> 31:07.330
You decided your cut Wasn't enough.

31:07.400 --> 31:11.230
And when she wouldn't give
you More,you strangled her.

31:11.310 --> 31:14.790
No.No! I didn't.

31:14.810 --> 31:17.000
Give me a name.

31:17.060 --> 31:19.820
Who were you blackmailing?

31:22.090 --> 31:24.640
All right,then,i guess The
only thing left to discuss

31:24.700 --> 31:29.950
Is how you got sue emery's
body Into ray hodge's casket.

31:32.010 --> 31:34.570
Well,that's The
million-dollar question.

31:34.650 --> 31:38.580
did you dump The girl's remains
In the casket At the funeral home?

31:38.590 --> 31:40.610
I've never been To the funeral home.

31:40.680 --> 31:44.300
I don't even know where
That sheffield place is.

31:45.970 --> 31:52.840
I never said The funeral home
Was sheffield and eckhart,Mr. Hauser.

31:57.070 --> 32:01.960
-I,uh -- I want an attorney.
-Yes,you do.

32:02.180 --> 32:07.240
Preferably one With
death-penalty experience.

32:16.220 --> 32:18.960
-Some cake?
-Thank you,buzz.

32:18.970 --> 32:19.640
But,no,thank you.

32:19.720 --> 32:21.680
-It's really good. 
-No,no,no. Thanks.

32:21.750 --> 32:23.490
So,you ready to press
charges On this guy?

32:23.540 --> 32:25.200
No,we don't have Enough evidence yet,

32:25.270 --> 32:29.720
So we'll hold him for 48 hours,Release him,
Let him think He's off our radar,and --

32:29.730 --> 32:31.850
Oh,my gosh,That cake smells amazing.

32:31.930 --> 32:35.120
That's what you get For 30,000 bucks.

32:35.220 --> 32:38.230
Oh,well. They're hateful people.

32:38.290 --> 32:41.430
Why hold hauser for two days
If we're just gonna release him?

32:41.490 --> 32:43.630
Because that will give you
And lieutenant provenza time

32:43.710 --> 32:46.530
To fill out a warrant to get a
Wiretap for mr. Hauser's phone.

32:46.610 --> 32:50.170
You've got to be kidding.
Do you know how much That's gonna cost --

32:50.180 --> 32:52.410
Two detectives On
alternating 12-hour shifts?

32:52.490 --> 32:54.800
-I'm not gonna authorize that. 
-All right,then.

32:54.900 --> 32:58.060
Write me a letter explaining That i
 didn't solve the murder Of the naked woman

32:58.140 --> 33:01.520
who rolled Out of the detective's 
casket Because it cost too much.

33:04.050 --> 33:07.010
Fine,but he better have A lot 
to say In a short amount of time.

33:07.040 --> 33:09.910
Some unsolicited
advice,Lieutenant flynn.

33:09.990 --> 33:11.300
If you want that wiretap Approved,

33:11.360 --> 33:14.700
It's essential that you not
only List incriminating evidence,

33:14.770 --> 33:16.340
But anything That might clear him.

33:16.420 --> 33:19.520
Exculpatory information? That's easy.

33:19.530 --> 33:20.140
It is?

33:20.150 --> 33:23.520
Yes. We can't prove yet That scott 
hauser Had access to the casket.

33:23.600 --> 33:27.830
He may have suffered Serious financial 
loss At the death of sue emery,

33:27.880 --> 33:31.700
And his fingerprints Aren't on 
anything Connected To the actual murder.

33:31.710 --> 33:34.590
***That is the best frosting
I've ever had in my life.

33:34.660 --> 33:37.510
Mmm. Buttercream with just
A hint of grand marnier.

33:37.570 --> 33:41.680
So,me and flynn Are gonna stay up all 
night Working on some warrant for...

33:41.690 --> 33:46.180
For someone you could say Had good 
reason Not to commit the murder.

33:46.480 --> 33:48.110
Exactly.

33:51.680 --> 33:52.920
-And,buzz?
-Yes,ma'am?

33:52.930 --> 33:56.040
Could you cut me A
nice-sized wedge to go?

33:56.120 --> 34:00.400
And make sure my piece
Has a flower on it. Thank you.

34:06.840 --> 34:08.639
You realize it's after 5:00?

34:08.710 --> 34:10.270
We have three houses to see Before it gets dark,

34:10.350 --> 34:12.580
And you have just spent 
Half an hour on your mouth.

34:12.630 --> 34:16.230
Well,apparently there's
A lot to spend time on.

34:20.820 --> 34:22.250
What do you think Of this one?

34:22.330 --> 34:25.449
Oh,that's the best one
yet. What color is it?

34:25.510 --> 34:26.940
Reddish brown.

34:27.000 --> 34:30.260
They're all reddish brown.

34:30.690 --> 34:36.100
Revlon super lustrous.

34:41.870 --> 34:44.920
Do you like my lips?

34:45.620 --> 34:48.929
Like them? I love them.

34:48.969 --> 34:52.630
If you didn't Have those lips,
I'd be looking for them On someone else.

34:52.690 --> 35:01.140
Honestly,i think you look as
Beautiful as you've ever looked.

35:01.170 --> 35:03.770
Did i say something wrong?

35:03.850 --> 35:05.360
I said something wrong.

35:05.400 --> 35:07.770
"as beautiful As i've ever looked"?

35:07.830 --> 35:12.500
That's almost exactly what
The funeral director said --Mr. Eckhart.

35:13.480 --> 35:17.930
Ohh,i was thrown off When he threw up.

35:23.040 --> 35:25.150
Well,the judge got The
paperwork at 8:00 a.m.

35:25.230 --> 35:28.690
We got the go-ahead On
the wiretap at 8:45 a.m.

35:28.770 --> 35:32.090
Hauser was sprung
Exactly 20 minutes ago.

35:32.150 --> 35:33.520
Yeah,he made Two
phone calls --

35:33.560 --> 35:37.040
One for a massage, One to his mother,
Who thinks he's in law school.

35:37.080 --> 35:40.680
I hope she's not disappointed
When he takes the bar Behind bars.

35:40.760 --> 35:44.900
Chief,hauser's leaving
A message on a cellphone For someone.

35:49.410 --> 35:52.410
Lieutenant,would you please Get a 
search warrant For the funeral home?

35:52.640 --> 35:55.280
-For what?
-Pictures.

35:55.290 --> 35:57.660
Let me play it back.

35:57.670 --> 35:59.940
about the money.I'll need a 
little more Than we agreed to.

36:00.020 --> 36:01.850
Actually,twice as much.

36:01.970 --> 36:06.070
I mean it is the same book
But now it tells A whole other story.

36:06.100 --> 36:09.500
Meet me at defabio's at noon.

36:14.910 --> 36:17.870
-Hello. May i help you?
-No,i'm good. Thanks.

36:31.950 --> 36:34.580
You look great,jonathan.

36:34.620 --> 36:37.170
Did you give yourself
A little chemical peel?

36:37.240 --> 36:39.640
The photos.

36:39.710 --> 36:42.670
Do you have something For me?

36:49.360 --> 36:51.920
All right.

36:59.160 --> 37:03.650
We need to,um,reach A
little understanding,john.

37:03.700 --> 37:07.230
See,the police,They
have this insane idea

37:07.280 --> 37:11.030
That i murdered the woman That i loved.

37:11.090 --> 37:14.840
You didn't love sue.It was all 
about the money To you -- my money.

37:14.910 --> 37:17.410
And it was just sex to you,Doctor.

37:17.490 --> 37:22.240
Otherwise you would have Married her,
Like you promised her.

37:22.250 --> 37:26.530
A divorce would have left
me Financially devastated.

37:26.610 --> 37:30.550
-I-i tried to explain that To sue.
-What,by grabbing her Around the throat

37:30.590 --> 37:33.360
And choking her to death?

37:33.980 --> 37:35.180
Okay,now,look.

37:35.260 --> 37:38.700
This -- This
is for the book,

37:38.760 --> 37:41.620
Like we agreed.

37:42.720 --> 37:46.100
But if you don't want Anyone
else knowing what i know,

37:46.160 --> 37:50.830
I'll expect cash payments
On a regular basis.

37:50.870 --> 37:55.350
About what you were paying 
For sue's house -That would do it.

37:56.670 --> 38:00.330
You can't blackmail me Over an accident.

38:00.380 --> 38:05.850
Which part was an accident, Strangling her
Or dumping sue In some guy's casket?

38:05.860 --> 38:08.170
She wouldn't listen.

38:08.220 --> 38:10.920
She wanted to ruin me. She said so.

38:11.020 --> 38:16.170
I lost control of my temper
For one second,that's all.

38:18.780 --> 38:21.680
I wonder if the police Will
see it the same way,john.

38:21.760 --> 38:23.640
No,we won't.

38:23.680 --> 38:25.220
Lieutenant,I know you've met mr. Hauser,

38:25.260 --> 38:27.490
But why don't you reacquaint
By reading him his rights?

38:27.530 --> 38:30.690
You would think He would know 
them by now.Leave the money.

38:35.330 --> 38:39.570
Detective,thank god.
Thank god you're here.

38:39.590 --> 38:42.240
Do you know,that man,he was --
He was trying to blackmail me.

38:42.300 --> 38:44.280
Oh,how distressing.

38:44.340 --> 38:47.560
-Do you mind If i sit down? 
-Please.

38:50.420 --> 38:52.230
Beyond the obviouspersonnel,

38:52.300 --> 38:56.090
I couldn't imagine Who else might 
have had access To the funeral home.

38:56.150 --> 38:59.010
But then i realized
Sometimes it's not enough

38:59.060 --> 39:03.830
To slap a fresh coat of lipstick
On some cadaver's giant mouth.

39:03.980 --> 39:08.340
No.To make someone look as
good As they've ever looked,

39:08.400 --> 39:12.530
The skills of a surgeon Are required.

39:12.560 --> 39:17.040
These were recently obtained
From sheffield and eckhart.

39:17.090 --> 39:19.350
I can see why they
paid For your services

39:19.420 --> 39:23.670
And gave you the code To their security system
So you could come and go On your own schedule.

39:23.670 --> 39:26.520
Look,detective,i don't know
What you think happened.

39:26.670 --> 39:32.120
We have you on tape saying
That you murdered her,doctor.

39:32.180 --> 39:36.360
-No,no,no,I was only saying --
-No,please,Don't say anything else.

39:36.370 --> 39:40.900
This is the fun part.
I always like to guess.

39:41.670 --> 39:44.810
Sue emery and scott hauser
Were blackmailing you,

39:44.890 --> 39:48.640
So you hired A retired l.a.p.d. Officer
To act as your go-between.

39:48.650 --> 39:52.560
You were the john that ray
hodge Said was being extorted.

39:52.630 --> 39:56.230
And when hodge jotted down,"p.s.
Agreed to payment terms,"

39:56.290 --> 39:57.700
He meant you.

39:57.760 --> 40:01.130
"p.s." stands for "plastic
surgeon," doesn't it?

40:01.180 --> 40:03.050
But then ray hodge Had
a fatal heart attack.

40:03.100 --> 40:08.240
And for a limited time only,You
had access to his coffin.

40:08.980 --> 40:11.900
The book,please?

40:22.390 --> 40:26.360
I had been envisioning Compromising photos
Of a completely Different sort.

40:26.400 --> 40:32.830
I had no idea they were gonna be Before-and-after 
photos Of your famous clients.

40:33.830 --> 40:36.110
You ended your affair,

40:36.170 --> 40:39.710
And sue emery,who probably
Thought she loved you,

40:39.770 --> 40:43.950
Retaliated by stealing a
book Of your finest work.

40:45.170 --> 40:49.820
Oh! Lieutenant,um...

40:50.100 --> 40:53.760
We need to get this book
Brought into evidence.

40:53.790 --> 40:56.690
Could you please call chief
pope And set up a meeting,please?

40:56.730 --> 40:58.670
Oh,yes,ma'am.

40:58.710 --> 41:01.050
Now,if you don't mind My being blunt,

41:01.110 --> 41:04.720
You're under arrest
For murder in the first.

41:04.760 --> 41:10.180
Oh,um,i do want to thank you
For one thing,though,doctor.

41:10.260 --> 41:15.050
That old lipstick color,It
did make my mouth look big.

41:25.240 --> 41:28.820
???.go ahead. We'll continue
With our civil lawsuit.

41:28.880 --> 41:30.460
Then we'll bury you In paperwork.

41:30.500 --> 41:33.710
I see.and by pressing a legal
action You expect to lose,

41:33.780 --> 41:36.250
You think you will gain what,Exactly?

41:36.310 --> 41:38.760
Well,i'm defending
My family's good name.

41:38.790 --> 41:40.200
And as far as your
threats Are concerned,

41:40.260 --> 41:44.070
There isn't a judge In this entire state
Who would put my daughte In jail.

41:44.410 --> 41:48.250
Now,which daughter Is that?Um...

41:48.370 --> 41:53.620
this one? Or this one?

41:55.750 --> 41:59.050
-Those pictures Are confidential.
-They were.

41:59.060 --> 42:04.220
And then we arrested Your plastic surgeon 
for murder,And they became evidence.

42:04.690 --> 42:11.680
I imagine under The right circumstances,
A judge might be persuaded To exclude them.

42:23.060 --> 42:26.590
You agree to drop all charges Against michelle,
And we won't continue With our civil lawsuit.

42:26.670 --> 42:29.500
Very good. And i think
An apology is in order.

42:29.560 --> 42:31.990
All right. That would be nice.

42:32.860 --> 42:36.860
Oh,you  Oh,you thought? Yeah. No.

42:36.870 --> 42:38.450
I need an apology
From you,sir --

42:38.530 --> 42:41.900
Written,signed,Distributed to the media.
That sort of thing.

42:41.910 --> 42:44.230
Never in a million years. Never!

42:44.380 --> 42:46.280
-Daddy? 
-Never. Never.

42:46.360 --> 42:51.530
Write it.Write it.

42:57.140 --> 42:59.900
Fine. Let's get out of this hole.

42:59.950 --> 43:04.390
Oh,oh,i'm sorry.I almost forgot.

43:04.460 --> 43:12.820
You know,Giving this back to you Is almost 
as sweet as The icing on your cake.

43:13.090 --> 43:15.350
