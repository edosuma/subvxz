03:19.967 --> 03:21.472
A week ago, the only thing

03:21.572 --> 03:22.300
I thought was...

03:22.400 --> 03:25.925
Out of the ordinary was
that it was my birthday.

03:49.134 --> 03:52.234
Sorry.

03:52.234 --> 03:54.234
I’m just bored.

03:55.800 --> 03:57.800
Oh.

04:09.301 --> 04:11.400
Unit 5, come in.

04:12.934 --> 04:15.167
Unit 5, come in.

04:15.167 --> 04:17.167
Do you read me, unit 5?

04:18.934 --> 04:20.159
Of course, things

04:20.259 --> 04:22.259
Didn't really start here.

04:27.967 --> 04:31.067
* I’ll have a blue... *

04:31.067 --> 04:33.567
How do I look?

04:33.567 --> 04:35.567
The truth?
- I look like...

04:35.569 --> 04:37.201
a rock star, don't I?

04:37.301 --> 04:39.663
You look great.
- Hey, what's going on...

04:39.763 --> 04:40.300
with you?

04:40.400 --> 04:41.478
What?
- Why are you acting...

04:41.578 --> 04:41.934
so weird?

04:42.034 --> 04:43.272
What do you mean?
- You got drugs on you?

04:43.372 --> 04:43.934
Smoking cigarettes?

04:44.034 --> 04:45.701
Huh? Oh, just holding them for a friend, huh?

04:45.801 --> 04:46.400
Have a good time.

04:46.500 --> 04:48.533
Ha ha.
- have a good time.

04:48.533 --> 04:51.567
Aggie, you okay?

04:53.234 --> 04:56.667
Sexy.

04:56.667 --> 04:58.834
Do you hate me?

04:58.834 --> 05:00.634
As much now as the day I met you.

05:00.734 --> 05:02.857
You know,
I might be contagious.

05:02.957 --> 05:04.168
I could be immune.

05:04.268 --> 05:07.333
What about the party?
- Like they're gonna miss me.

05:07.433 --> 05:10.368
What about the cake?

05:10.368 --> 05:12.126
I’d like two words...

05:12.226 --> 05:13.168
on my tombstone--...

05:13.268 --> 05:15.368
'What if?'

05:15.368 --> 05:18.600
What if I had said screw the cake?

05:18.600 --> 05:20.134
Single tonight, Walter?

05:20.234 --> 05:22.533
Not actually, no.

05:22.533 --> 05:25.101
Oh, hey!
- Oh, come on.

05:25.101 --> 05:26.293
Why don't you wag your tail at me...

05:26.393 --> 05:27.134
in the bitches' room?

05:27.234 --> 05:28.700
Sybil.

05:28.800 --> 05:30.077
What if I had been...

05:30.177 --> 05:30.634
a bit more...

05:30.734 --> 05:32.367
Sybil, I wouldn't wag my tail in the bathroom...

05:32.467 --> 05:35.300
with you if you were the last bitch on earth.

05:35.400 --> 05:38.700
...tactful?

05:38.700 --> 05:41.400
Sparrow, I repeat.

05:41.400 --> 05:43.834
We have an unidentified scavenger sighting.

05:43.934 --> 05:45.534
It’s one minute to 5:00, Sybil.

05:45.634 --> 05:48.767
Then we're agreed you're still on duty.

05:50.934 --> 05:53.934
Mm-hmm, yeah, sure.

05:55.067 --> 05:57.967
Sounds delicious.
Can I get it to go?

06:00.268 --> 06:02.467
Right.

06:02.467 --> 06:05.634
Okay okay.

06:15.467 --> 06:18.634
Come to papa.

06:18.634 --> 06:20.234
Maybe you'd like to hear a story.

06:20.334 --> 06:22.767
Hmm?

06:22.767 --> 06:25.967
Yeah, once upon a time...

06:25.967 --> 06:28.101
there was a dog...

06:28.101 --> 06:29.734
who lived a life of terror,

06:29.834 --> 06:32.934
feared no one.

06:32.934 --> 06:36.467
But although his teeth were sharp...

06:36.467 --> 06:39.734
and his belly full,

06:39.734 --> 06:41.234
his heart was empty.

06:41.334 --> 06:44.400
He decided to go on a journey...

06:44.400 --> 06:48.268
to a land far far away,

06:48.268 --> 06:51.800
where he came upon a wooden shack one day...

06:51.800 --> 06:55.301
with a thin old man inside.

06:55.301 --> 06:58.034
And he invited him in.

06:58.034 --> 07:00.234
The dog...

07:00.234 --> 07:03.700
was overjoyed.

07:03.700 --> 07:05.534
And that night...

07:05.634 --> 07:08.867
warm smoke billowed from the chimney above,

07:08.867 --> 07:11.067
but, oh...

07:11.067 --> 07:14.067
what an odd-smelling smoke this was.

07:14.067 --> 07:17.301
You see,
the land was China.

07:18.467 --> 07:21.301
And in China,

07:21.301 --> 07:24.368
they eat dog.

07:24.368 --> 07:26.467
Whoa! Ooh!

07:28.167 --> 07:31.500
Let me see who your irresponsible owner is.

07:41.400 --> 07:44.400
Oh, god!

07:50.234 --> 07:52.234
Damn it!

07:54.667 --> 07:57.934
Didn’t like my story,
huh?

07:57.934 --> 08:01.667
That’s all right.
I can take criticism.

08:29.500 --> 08:31.268
Oh, god.

08:31.368 --> 08:33.618
Oh, I don't believe this shit.

08:37.567 --> 08:40.901
All right, buddy,
pick a spot.

08:45.167 --> 08:48.301
Now where'd you go?

09:39.700 --> 09:41.268
Destiny--...

09:41.368 --> 09:43.400
Maybe that's too big a word for it.

09:43.500 --> 09:46.305
If I’d been nicer to Sybil,
she never would have sent me...

09:46.405 --> 09:47.134
after that dog.

09:47.234 --> 09:49.700
I wouldn't have been late to meet Agatha,

09:49.800 --> 09:52.367
and none of this would have happened.

09:52.467 --> 09:54.234
But I was late.

09:54.334 --> 09:56.467
And that's all it took.

09:56.467 --> 09:58.467
Oh!

09:59.800 --> 10:02.599
Take a look at that.
Try not to throw up.

10:02.699 --> 10:03.433
Oh oh, god!

10:03.533 --> 10:05.567
'Nasty evil dog'--

10:05.567 --> 10:07.934
That's what 'Ned' stands for.

10:07.934 --> 10:09.499
If I ever see him again,
he's gonna be Ned...

10:09.599 --> 10:10.101
with two d's--...

10:10.201 --> 10:11.767
'Nasty evil dead dog.'

10:11.867 --> 10:13.715
All right, now take a deep breath.

10:13.815 --> 10:14.268
Dead Ned.

10:14.368 --> 10:16.567
That’s what he's gonna be.
- And remember,

10:16.667 --> 10:18.534
it's your birthday, okay?

10:18.634 --> 10:19.811
Yeah, I’ve been thinking about that.

10:19.911 --> 10:20.134
Hmm-hmm.

10:20.234 --> 10:22.043
Why is it we go and see your friends...

10:22.143 --> 10:22.867
on my birthday?

10:22.967 --> 10:24.433
Um...

10:24.533 --> 10:27.301
Probably because you don't have any.

10:27.301 --> 10:28.901
Oh.

10:29.001 --> 10:31.001
Makes sense.

10:31.001 --> 10:33.734
So I’m older, I’m disfigured,

10:33.734 --> 10:35.634
and I’m spending an evening in hell.

10:35.734 --> 10:37.648
No.
- I suppose I’m buying...

10:37.748 --> 10:38.934
that for you too.

10:39.034 --> 10:40.272
Well, actually, I’ve had a good long time...

10:40.372 --> 10:40.934
to flip through it.

10:41.034 --> 10:42.567
Why don't you give it a try?

10:42.667 --> 10:45.076
Have some writer fill my head with nonsense?

10:45.176 --> 10:46.467
I’ll wait for the movie.

10:46.567 --> 10:48.067
You don't know what you're missing.

10:48.167 --> 10:50.934
Hmm, and yet life goes on.

10:50.934 --> 10:53.134
'The number 23.'

10:53.134 --> 10:56.101
A novel of obsession by Topsy Kretts.'

10:56.101 --> 10:58.101
Hmm.

10:59.067 --> 11:01.333
'A heart-wrenching odyssey into paranoia.

11:01.433 --> 11:03.967
One of the most horrifying
metamorphoses ever told.

11:04.067 --> 11:06.533
Beware of the dog next door.'

11:06.533 --> 11:09.500
Get out of here.
Are you kidding me?

11:09.500 --> 11:11.467
I’m buying this for you, okay?

11:11.567 --> 11:13.101
Would you get the cake?
- Yeah.

11:13.201 --> 11:15.228
February 3rd, that makes...

11:15.328 --> 11:15.901
me Aquarius.

11:16.001 --> 11:19.234
Experts say friends are vitally important.

11:19.234 --> 11:20.767
Hi.
- Hello.

11:20.867 --> 11:22.268
Hi.
- Hey.

11:22.368 --> 11:25.700
Hello.
- Hey.

11:25.700 --> 11:27.201
I’m sorry we're late.

11:27.301 --> 11:29.367
Nothing a kiss won't cure.
- Oh!

11:29.467 --> 11:31.837
I am living proof of...

11:31.937 --> 11:33.567
the fallacy of astrology.

11:33.667 --> 11:36.301
Hi. How’s your arm, birthday boy?

11:36.301 --> 11:37.679
You okay?
- Just waiting for it...

11:37.779 --> 11:38.300
to fall off.

11:38.400 --> 11:40.288
Good thing it didn't bite you somewhere else.

11:40.388 --> 11:40.467
Oh.

11:40.567 --> 11:42.057
Five seconds. Five seconds.

11:42.157 --> 11:42.667
Fourth word.

11:42.767 --> 11:44.901
Birds, butterflies, birds.
- It flies.

11:45.001 --> 11:46.300
Birds, birds.
- Flies, flies.

11:46.400 --> 11:49.775
'Lord of the flies'!

11:51.734 --> 11:54.334
Okay, you're next.
- Thank you.

12:06.567 --> 12:08.361
'All the characters in this...

12:08.461 --> 12:09.268
book are fictitious,

12:09.368 --> 12:11.045
and anyone finding a resemblance...

12:11.145 --> 12:12.067
to actual persons,

12:12.167 --> 12:15.317
living or dead,
should proceed no further.'

12:20.034 --> 12:22.364
Now it's time for birthday sex.

12:23.368 --> 12:25.834
I need a lot of birthday sex.

12:30.600 --> 12:32.634
You know what?
- What?

12:32.634 --> 12:34.134
Let’s sit out here for a while.

12:34.234 --> 12:36.567
Oh-- oh, honey.

12:36.567 --> 12:39.333
Come on, it'll be romantic.
- Yeah, but it's also cold.

12:39.433 --> 12:41.800
Here, take my coat.

12:41.800 --> 12:45.134
Your jacket, take it.
I’ll call you.

12:49.800 --> 12:53.067
Mom, dad. I thought I heard voices.

12:53.067 --> 12:54.634
Well, you know,

12:54.734 --> 12:56.795
if someone was in bed
asleep the way they were...

12:56.895 --> 12:57.534
supposed to be,

12:57.634 --> 12:59.119
they wouldn't hear any voices.

12:59.219 --> 12:59.834
In bed? Okay.

12:59.934 --> 13:02.967
You’re supposed to be in bed.

13:02.967 --> 13:06.034
Oh, dad. Dad, I, uh,
forgot to give you this.

13:06.134 --> 13:08.234
Here.
- Oh, cool.

13:08.234 --> 13:10.128
Yeah, I wrapped it myself.

13:10.228 --> 13:10.467
Yeah.

13:10.567 --> 13:14.101
I accept bribes any time of the day or night.

13:14.101 --> 13:15.867
Back door?

13:15.967 --> 13:17.700
She went down the alley.

13:17.800 --> 13:19.534
Wow, that's cool.

13:19.634 --> 13:23.268
Robin,
she's a nice girl.

13:23.268 --> 13:25.168
Make sure she stays that way.

13:25.268 --> 13:27.567
All right.
Good night, dad.

13:27.567 --> 13:29.934
Happy birthday.
- Thanks.

13:40.268 --> 13:42.893
'Chapter 1: you can...

13:42.943 --> 13:44.600
call me Fingerling.

13:44.700 --> 13:46.767
It’s not my real name.

13:46.767 --> 13:49.500
It came from a book I read as a child,

13:49.600 --> 13:52.201
'Fingerling at the zoo.'

13:52.201 --> 13:54.500
Paper flap long gone,

13:54.500 --> 13:58.001
it had a green hardback cover
and mottled texture.

13:58.101 --> 14:01.600
It was possibly my very first book.

14:01.600 --> 14:03.268
Funny,

14:03.368 --> 14:06.467
I can't recall what it was about.

14:06.467 --> 14:09.001
The only thing I remember is the name--...

14:09.101 --> 14:10.967
Fingerling.

14:11.067 --> 14:13.634
I wished it was mine...

14:13.634 --> 14:16.500
And now it is.'

14:29.001 --> 14:30.700
This is your first bite?

14:30.800 --> 14:32.800
First animal one, yes.

14:32.800 --> 14:35.367
My wife, she has these gnawing urges...

14:35.467 --> 14:37.467
in her sleep and...

14:37.467 --> 14:40.234
Tell me about this canine Ned.

14:40.234 --> 14:41.723
What would you do if you came across...

14:41.823 --> 14:42.201
him again?

14:42.301 --> 14:45.634
If I was in my truck,
I’d accelerate...

14:45.634 --> 14:47.667
until I heard a thud.

14:49.800 --> 14:51.867
I’m sorry.
I’m just-- I’m joking.

14:51.967 --> 14:53.867
I just-- this is just silly.

14:53.967 --> 14:55.973
Mr. Sparrow,
animal-control...

14:56.073 --> 14:57.268
regulations state...

14:57.368 --> 14:59.901
that any officer suffering
at the hands of an animal...

15:00.001 --> 15:03.333
must undergo psychological
counseling within seven days...

15:03.433 --> 15:05.333
to evaluate their state of mind.

15:05.433 --> 15:07.500
I gave him my arm on a platter.

15:07.600 --> 15:10.500
Can't blame a creature
of lower intelligence for that.

15:10.600 --> 15:12.686
I made a mistake, okay?
Write that down.

15:12.786 --> 15:13.667
I made a mistake.

15:13.767 --> 15:16.600
It's my fault-- like when I told my wife

15:16.700 --> 15:18.367
She could choose the color...

15:18.467 --> 15:20.600
for the living room walls,
you know?

15:20.700 --> 15:24.300
Not that women are of
lower intelligence, just...

15:27.034 --> 15:29.167
Have a good day,
Mr. Sparrow.

15:29.167 --> 15:30.333
No, I’m jus--

15:30.433 --> 15:34.033
No, Agatha is the most
intelligent person I know.

15:34.667 --> 15:36.567
What she sees in me,
I’m not sure.

15:36.667 --> 15:38.300
Look...

15:38.400 --> 15:40.467
I love my job,
and I’m good at it.

15:40.567 --> 15:42.300
Ned got away.

15:42.400 --> 15:45.001
Well, yeah, but...

15:45.001 --> 15:46.590
Don't worry.
Apart from a flawed...

15:46.690 --> 15:47.433
sense of humor,

15:47.533 --> 15:49.667
I’m giving you a clean bill of health.

15:49.767 --> 15:51.367
You're not a danger to anyone.

15:51.467 --> 15:55.067
That's why you can go
and have the whole day off.

15:55.533 --> 15:58.334
Really?

15:58.334 --> 16:00.334
I’ll take it.

16:00.334 --> 16:01.934
Mr. Sparrow.
- yeah.

16:02.034 --> 16:04.600
What color did your wife choose for the walls?

16:04.700 --> 16:06.800
Red, blood red.

16:13.667 --> 16:15.692
'Chapter 2:

16:18.834 --> 16:22.067
Imagine me, if you must,

16:22.067 --> 16:24.067
as someone you once knew.

16:25.867 --> 16:29.700
Someone perhaps you liked.

16:29.700 --> 16:32.433
Or better yet,

16:32.433 --> 16:35.734
imagine me as you.

16:35.734 --> 16:38.368
As a kid,
I was top of my class,

16:38.368 --> 16:40.700
not because I liked studying,
but because I realized...

16:40.800 --> 16:43.467
that an education was
my best shot at getting out.

16:43.567 --> 16:46.700
See, the stork dropped me
in a small dustbowl of a town.

16:46.800 --> 16:48.700
There wasn't anything wrong with it.

16:48.800 --> 16:50.800
As far as boring towns go,

16:50.800 --> 16:54.034
I’m sure it ranked above average.

16:54.034 --> 16:56.901
I had friends, but...

16:58.400 --> 17:00.767
I always felt alone.

17:03.334 --> 17:05.567
No one ever left,

17:05.567 --> 17:07.467
but I wasn't gonna die here.

17:07.567 --> 17:09.201
As much as I loved him,

17:09.301 --> 17:12.500
I didn't want to be anything like my dad.

17:12.500 --> 17:16.433
He seemed so distant and sad.

17:16.433 --> 17:19.134
Numbers were his life.
He was an accountant.

17:19.234 --> 17:21.219
And I guess he had expected me to take over...

17:21.319 --> 17:22.500
the business he had built,

17:22.600 --> 17:24.667
but I had other plans.

17:24.667 --> 17:26.600
My mom was tickled pink on my eighth birthday...

17:26.700 --> 17:29.801
when I announced I wanted to be a detective.

17:29.901 --> 17:31.734
Can't say the same for my father.

17:31.834 --> 17:34.700
It really put the kibosh on his master plan...

17:34.800 --> 17:37.400
and it fueled his hatred for the widow Dobkins.

17:37.500 --> 17:39.500
She lived next door.

17:39.500 --> 17:40.977
It sounds odd,
but her dog Alfie...

17:41.800 --> 17:43.834
is the reason I became a detective.

17:43.934 --> 17:46.467
The grass is always greener on the other side,

17:46.567 --> 17:48.534
at least according to Alfie.

17:48.634 --> 17:50.700
That's why he was always in our yard,

17:50.800 --> 17:53.167
and it was my job to catch him.

17:55.034 --> 17:58.534
But I never crossed the fence
into the widow Dobkins' yard.

17:58.634 --> 18:00.867
That was my father's rule.

18:00.867 --> 18:03.101
On my eighth birthday,

18:03.101 --> 18:05.101
I broke the rule.

18:10.101 --> 18:11.971
Now I must admit that my loneliness

18:12.071 --> 18:12.734
And obsession...

18:12.834 --> 18:16.334
with detective stories had fueled fantasies.

18:16.334 --> 18:19.034
So I’m not sure of all the details,

18:19.034 --> 18:21.201
except one.

18:23.201 --> 18:25.226
The widow Dobkins was dead.

18:32.901 --> 18:35.767
It was a whole hour before the doctor arrived,

18:35.867 --> 18:37.567
and in that uncertain hour...

18:37.667 --> 18:40.067
my eight-year-old mind raced.

18:40.067 --> 18:41.743
I decided that the widow Dobkins...

18:41.843 --> 18:42.333
was killed...

18:42.433 --> 18:44.901
by a man with a deranged mind,

18:44.901 --> 18:47.834
A mind such as our town had never seen before.

18:47.934 --> 18:50.099
No one would be safe from him, not even...

18:50.199 --> 18:51.001
his loved ones.

18:51.101 --> 18:53.234
Especially his loved ones.

18:53.234 --> 18:54.808
Of course, a doctor later concluded that...

18:54.908 --> 18:55.467
it was suicide,

18:55.567 --> 18:58.167
But I never believed it.

18:58.167 --> 19:00.110
By then, my mind had been opened...

19:00.210 --> 19:01.767
to a whole new existence.

19:01.867 --> 19:05.101
From this, a detective was born--...

19:05.101 --> 19:07.234
Detective Fingerling.'

19:12.167 --> 19:14.167
This has promise too.

19:15.467 --> 19:18.168
Hey, there you are.
What are you doing?

19:18.268 --> 19:20.700
I’ll clean this up later.

19:20.700 --> 19:22.500
Filling your head with nonsense, are you?

19:22.600 --> 19:25.467
Did you read this?
- most of it.

19:25.467 --> 19:28.767
It's very creative.
- this Fingerling guy.

19:28.767 --> 19:30.333
Yeah, it's a cool name.

19:30.433 --> 19:32.634
Yeah, what did you make of him?

19:32.734 --> 19:34.702
I loved him at the-- well, at the beginning

19:34.802 --> 19:35.034
I did.

19:35.134 --> 19:36.967
What do you mean at the beginning?

19:37.067 --> 19:39.934
Well, he-- how far have you gotten?

19:39.934 --> 19:41.934
Oh, two chapters.
- Oh.

19:41.934 --> 19:43.611
Honey, will you move this ladder for me,

19:43.711 --> 19:44.567
Just right over here?

19:44.667 --> 19:46.726
You know, honey, this Fingerling guy...

19:46.826 --> 19:48.101
reminds me of my life.

19:48.201 --> 19:50.368
It's so weird.

19:50.368 --> 19:53.612
Like, it's like my childhood, my memories,

19:53.712 --> 19:54.268
you know?

19:54.368 --> 19:56.843
Will you hand me that blue paint?

19:58.067 --> 20:00.317
Here.
- Fingerling's nothing...

20:00.417 --> 20:01.034
like you.

20:01.134 --> 20:04.467
Oh, yeah,
look at that?

20:04.467 --> 20:06.791
'Fingerling at the zoo.'
My mother read it to me...

20:06.891 --> 20:07.700
when I was a kid.

20:07.800 --> 20:09.734
I’m sure a lot of people read that as a kid.

20:09.834 --> 20:12.134
Did you?
- No.

20:12.134 --> 20:13.460
Ha-aa!
- But you know what?

20:13.560 --> 20:14.834
Every time I read a book,

20:14.934 --> 20:17.481
it's like, the author stole a part of me that

20:17.581 --> 20:18.801
I thought only I knew.

20:18.901 --> 20:20.835
Someday I’m gonna write a book and I’ll do it...

20:20.935 --> 20:21.634
to somebody else.

20:21.734 --> 20:24.400
I don't know, hon.
It's-- it's just really...

20:24.500 --> 20:26.967
kind of strange.
- You know what?

20:26.967 --> 20:28.909
There's a lot of neighborhoods with...

20:29.009 --> 20:30.268
houses just like yours,

20:30.368 --> 20:32.234
with streets just like yours.

20:32.334 --> 20:34.101
Yeah?
With dogs next door?

20:34.201 --> 20:36.667
Oh, your neighbor had a dog.
Well, that's shocking.

20:36.767 --> 20:38.564
It wasn't called Alfie.

20:38.664 --> 20:39.700
It was called Chief.

20:39.800 --> 20:41.700
'Mis-chief' my father called it.

20:41.800 --> 20:45.234
He used to escape all the time.
That's why I became an a.c.o.

20:45.334 --> 20:46.734
Fingerling's a detective.

20:46.834 --> 20:49.734
I used to collect detective magazines.

20:49.734 --> 20:52.667
And the widow next door,
Mrs. Dobkins,

20:52.667 --> 20:54.967
Well, that's like my mom.

20:56.533 --> 20:59.268
She died on my eighth birthday.

20:59.268 --> 21:01.934
Look, I got freakin' goose bumps.

21:01.934 --> 21:04.700
Honey, keep reading, okay?

21:04.700 --> 21:06.913
Soon you will discover that Fingerling is...

21:07.013 --> 21:07.901
nothing like you.

21:08.001 --> 21:09.534
Somebody wrote a book about dad?

21:09.634 --> 21:12.500
No.
- Yes. Yes.

21:12.500 --> 21:15.634
How's school?
- Horrible.

21:15.634 --> 21:18.134
Am I in it?

21:18.134 --> 21:20.034
I mean, if the book's about dad,

21:20.134 --> 21:21.901
Then I should have, like,
a starring role or something.

21:22.001 --> 21:23.901
Yes, you should,
and yet you don't.

21:24.001 --> 21:26.667
Now what do you think that means?

21:26.667 --> 21:29.268
Hmm, jeez.
- Who's that?

21:29.268 --> 21:31.901
Fabrizia.
- Fabrizia?

21:31.901 --> 21:33.700
Uh-huh.

21:41.467 --> 21:43.400
* Got a big plan,
this mindset *...

21:43.500 --> 21:45.591
* maybe it's right at the right place...

21:45.691 --> 21:46.567
and right time *...

21:46.667 --> 21:48.500
* maybe tonight and the whisper *...

21:48.600 --> 21:50.801
* or handshake sending a sign *...

21:50.901 --> 21:52.767
* Wanna make out and kiss hard? *...

21:52.867 --> 21:53.967
* Wait, never mind *...

21:54.067 --> 21:56.134
* Late night and passing *...

21:56.234 --> 21:58.168
* mention it flipped her best friend *...

21:58.268 --> 22:00.001
* Who knows saying maybe it slipped *...

22:00.101 --> 22:02.500
* but the slip turns to terror
and a crush to light *...

22:02.600 --> 22:05.067
* Then she walked in,
he throws up *...

22:05.167 --> 22:07.207
* Believe it's the fright,
it's cute in a way... *...

22:08.167 --> 22:10.573
* till you cannot speak and you leave to have...

22:10.673 --> 22:11.333
a cigarette *...

22:11.433 --> 22:14.333
* Your knees get weak,
escape was just a nod *...

22:14.433 --> 22:17.300
* and a casual wave,
obsessed about it *...

22:17.400 --> 22:19.234
* Heavy for the next two days *...

22:19.334 --> 22:22.634
* it's only just a crush it'll go away *...

22:22.634 --> 22:25.433
* it's just like all
the others, it'll go away *...

22:25.533 --> 22:28.600
* Or maybe this is danger
and you just don't know *...

22:28.700 --> 22:32.134
* You pray it all away
but it continues to grow *...

22:32.234 --> 22:36.268
* I want to hold you close *...

22:36.268 --> 22:38.500
* Skin pressed against me tight *...

22:38.600 --> 22:40.901
* Lie still,
close your eyes, girl *...

22:41.001 --> 22:43.626
* So lovely it feels so right. *...

23:54.101 --> 23:56.467
'Chapter 5:

23:56.467 --> 23:58.700
I meet the suicide blonde.'

24:32.834 --> 24:34.967
I got a tip from your neighborhood watch.

24:35.067 --> 24:37.268
I know what you're up to.

24:37.268 --> 24:40.467
This befriend-me crap,
it won't work.

24:40.467 --> 24:42.792
Come any closer and I’ll do it.

24:45.334 --> 24:47.168
Well, I hope you don't.

24:47.268 --> 24:49.301
It's my birthday today.

24:49.301 --> 24:50.814
You end up hanging yourself, it'll be...

24:50.914 --> 24:51.667
the worst one ever.

24:51.767 --> 24:54.533
You're pathetic.

24:56.301 --> 24:58.742
I’m serious.
I’ll do it.

24:58.842 --> 24:59.667
Hanging--

24:59.767 --> 25:01.834
It's a painful thing.

25:01.834 --> 25:03.901
Most people get the noose wrong,

25:04.001 --> 25:07.676
end up walking around
with a permanent necklace...

25:09.034 --> 25:12.059
Agonizing reminder of how fucking pitiful...

25:12.159 --> 25:14.034
they are.

25:14.134 --> 25:16.134
Come on, let's talk.

25:17.667 --> 25:20.692
If you're still bummed,
I’ll put one right...

25:20.792 --> 25:22.792
between your eyes.

25:23.934 --> 25:25.934
I’m a good shot.

25:30.533 --> 25:32.558
Is it really your birthday?

25:43.600 --> 25:45.302
'The suicide blonde tells...

25:45.402 --> 25:46.634
me she was a good person once,

25:46.734 --> 25:48.134
but now...'

25:48.234 --> 25:50.600
I’m a bad person.

25:51.934 --> 25:54.600
I don't wanna make you bad.

25:54.600 --> 25:57.001
You don't have that power.

25:58.533 --> 26:01.168
Go see my ex-boyfriend.
he'll show you.

26:01.268 --> 26:02.728
'I should have gotten...

26:02.828 --> 26:03.268
out of there...

26:03.368 --> 26:07.334
right at that moment,
but then she said...'

26:07.334 --> 26:09.067
It's this number!

26:09.167 --> 26:12.467
This fucking number-- 23.

26:12.467 --> 26:14.101
It rules my world.

26:14.201 --> 26:16.201
It's my father's fault.

26:16.201 --> 26:18.634
He said he'd found a way to beat the number,

26:18.734 --> 26:21.467
that he'd beat it,
that I was safe.

26:23.067 --> 26:26.101
He said, 'daddy loves you.
And he's gonna do something...

26:26.201 --> 26:28.326
both:...to guarantee that you...

26:28.426 --> 26:30.426
won't inherit the curse.'

26:34.533 --> 26:37.134
He was wrong.

26:37.134 --> 26:40.009
His guarantee wasn't worth the blood it...

26:40.109 --> 26:42.109
was written in.

26:45.201 --> 26:48.001
I guess daddy didn't love me enough.

26:50.967 --> 26:53.667
It's everywhere-- dates, times,

26:53.667 --> 26:56.400
license plate numbers, pages of books,

26:56.500 --> 26:58.067
even elevator floor lights.

26:58.167 --> 27:00.457
Soon I found it was in my name. It was in...

27:00.557 --> 27:01.534
the words I spoke.

27:01.634 --> 27:04.867
Nothing, nothing is safe.

27:04.867 --> 27:08.692
Pink is my favorite color.
Do you know what pink is?

27:11.667 --> 27:13.700
Red 27, white 65.

27:13.700 --> 27:16.201
65 plus 27-- 92.
Pink has four letters.

27:16.301 --> 27:18.867
92 divided by four.

27:18.867 --> 27:20.867
Twenty-fucking-three!

27:22.301 --> 27:24.034
'I’ll be honest--...

27:24.134 --> 27:26.167
I didn't get it.

27:26.167 --> 27:27.707
I asked her the only question

27:27.807 --> 27:28.634
I could muster.'

27:28.734 --> 27:30.834
Any more coffee?

27:30.834 --> 27:33.027
'It was important to keep...

27:33.127 --> 27:33.734
her talking,

27:33.834 --> 27:36.901
so I tell her a story.'

27:36.901 --> 27:39.673
I had this uncle,

27:39.773 --> 27:41.667
his name was Charlie.

27:41.767 --> 27:44.168
And, uh, one day,
he read in his stars...

27:44.268 --> 27:46.168
that he was gonna fall in love...

27:46.268 --> 27:48.433
with a woman in red.

27:48.433 --> 27:51.301
So he went out looking all day long...

27:51.301 --> 27:53.368
and he found one.

27:53.368 --> 27:55.268
Six months later, they were married.

27:55.368 --> 27:57.368
You're lying.

27:59.800 --> 28:02.289
Two years later, the woman in red...

28:02.389 --> 28:03.667
divorces my uncle,

28:03.767 --> 28:06.317
takes him for everything he's got.

28:07.734 --> 28:10.567
He's out there right now...

28:10.567 --> 28:12.667
at this very moment...

28:15.400 --> 28:18.025
still looking for the woman in red.

28:19.433 --> 28:21.983
Figures he just got the wrong one.

28:22.734 --> 28:25.333
And this is supposed to make
me feel better how?

28:25.433 --> 28:28.358
You look smarter than my uncle Charlie.

28:31.334 --> 28:33.644
'She has a face meant...

28:33.744 --> 28:34.268
to smile.

28:34.368 --> 28:36.134
And as I exit the building,

28:36.234 --> 28:38.934
I figure it's another job well done.

29:05.201 --> 29:07.500
The next day I traced the ex-boyfriend...

29:07.600 --> 29:10.234
suicide blonde mentioned.

29:10.234 --> 29:12.134
Burning coffee grounds is an old trick...

29:12.234 --> 29:14.757
cops use to take away the smell of death...

29:14.857 --> 29:15.901
at a crime scene.

29:16.001 --> 29:19.001
But somebody had used all the coffee.

29:33.167 --> 29:36.367
When I tell Fabrizia about the suicide blonde,

29:36.467 --> 29:39.734
she begs me to take her to the apartment.

29:39.734 --> 29:42.433
Her reaction is pure Fabrizia.

29:43.800 --> 29:46.400
Death and sex--...

29:46.400 --> 29:48.400
what a turn-on.

29:48.400 --> 29:50.567
As the pages fell from the walls,

29:50.667 --> 29:53.092
the scope of the suicide blonde's...

29:53.192 --> 29:54.767
obsession became clear.

29:54.867 --> 29:58.301
She had reduced everything to 23.'

29:58.301 --> 30:00.528
Suicide blonde's voice: it's everywhere--

30:00.628 --> 30:01.300
Dates, times,

30:01.400 --> 30:03.201
license plate numbers,
pages of books,

30:03.301 --> 30:05.537
even elevator floor lights.
Soon I found it was...

30:05.637 --> 30:06.134
in my name.

30:06.234 --> 30:08.001
It was in the words I spoke.

30:08.101 --> 30:10.600
It was in my name.
It was in my name.

30:10.700 --> 30:12.800
It was in the words I spoke.

30:14.667 --> 30:16.306
'When I found out what...

30:16.406 --> 30:16.934
her name was,

30:17.034 --> 30:19.500
that added up too.

30:19.500 --> 30:21.700
Maybe it was just a coincidence.

30:21.800 --> 30:25.467
I mean, a name is just a name.

30:25.467 --> 30:28.400
And a number is just a number.

30:28.400 --> 30:30.400
Isn't it?'

30:48.800 --> 30:51.400
It's self-printed,

30:51.400 --> 30:53.667
self-published,

30:53.667 --> 30:56.001
and it's by an author I never heard of.

31:02.433 --> 31:04.734
Looks like old Topsy here
hasn't written anything...

31:04.834 --> 31:06.901
before or after since.

31:14.067 --> 31:15.476
Walter, what are...

31:15.576 --> 31:16.134
you doing?

31:16.234 --> 31:19.001
Check this out.

31:19.001 --> 31:20.901
Walter Sparrow doesn't work.

31:21.001 --> 31:23.934
But if I use my middle name...

31:23.934 --> 31:26.533
Walter.
- 5-1-1-9-7.

31:26.533 --> 31:28.533
Isn't that amazing?
- What?

31:29.767 --> 31:32.433
It's all 23.
My birthday-- 2/3,

31:32.433 --> 31:34.276
Driver's license,
social security number--...

31:34.376 --> 31:34.834
everything.

31:34.934 --> 31:38.901
I was born at 11:12 p.m.
11 plus 12.

31:38.901 --> 31:41.550
It's like it's imitating...

31:41.650 --> 31:42.400
my life.

31:42.500 --> 31:44.067
You can't be serious.

31:44.167 --> 31:45.734
The author knows so much about me.

31:45.834 --> 31:47.400
It's as if he chose me.

31:47.500 --> 31:49.234
Is this what you've been doing all day?

31:49.334 --> 31:50.955
Have you finished the book?

31:51.055 --> 31:51.500
Not yet.

31:51.600 --> 31:53.600
You've concerned yourself with minutia...

31:53.700 --> 31:55.934
and you've drawn wild conclusions from them.

31:56.034 --> 31:57.420
What about the fact that Fingerling...

31:57.520 --> 31:58.168
becomes a killer?

31:58.268 --> 31:59.545
A killer?
- And just how many people...

31:59.645 --> 32:00.201
have you killed?

32:00.301 --> 32:02.634
Wait, who gets killed?

32:02.634 --> 32:04.201
Ask Mr. Fingerling.

32:04.301 --> 32:06.301
I’m sorry, honey.

32:09.734 --> 32:11.300
Why this color?

32:11.400 --> 32:14.067
Why did you choose this color?

32:14.067 --> 32:15.934
I don't know, you tell me.

32:16.034 --> 32:19.067
Red number five-- r-e-d is 27,

32:19.067 --> 32:20.600
Plus five is 32 which is--

32:20.700 --> 32:23.001
You're reaching now.

32:23.001 --> 32:24.901
Sure, there are differences.

32:25.001 --> 32:27.134
Fingerling's a detective,
I’m a dog catcher;

32:27.234 --> 32:29.567
He met Fabrizia when he was 32,

32:29.567 --> 32:30.934
whereas I met you when I was--...

32:31.034 --> 32:32.762
23.
- and the day...

32:32.862 --> 32:33.934
we met was?

32:34.034 --> 32:36.700
September 14th.
- 9/14.

32:36.700 --> 32:40.167
14 plus 9 is?
- 23!

32:40.167 --> 32:42.167
We married

32:42.236 --> 32:43.500
October 13th--...

32:43.600 --> 32:46.567
10/13, 23.

32:46.567 --> 32:48.234
Suicide blonde said it ruled her world.

32:48.334 --> 32:50.228
She killed because of it.
Then she handed it...

32:50.328 --> 32:51.001
on to Fingerling...

32:51.101 --> 32:53.400
on his 32nd birthday-- 23 reversed.

32:53.500 --> 32:56.034
Fingerling called it fate.
Do you know what fate is?

32:56.134 --> 32:58.533
32.

32:58.533 --> 33:00.558
I rest my case, your honor.

33:02.567 --> 33:04.110
Honey, I think you're
taking this too seriously.

33:04.210 --> 33:04.634
Wait wait wait...

33:04.734 --> 33:06.734
wait wait wait.
We live at 1814.

33:06.834 --> 33:08.245
I mean, 18 is one plus eight...

33:08.345 --> 33:09.234
which equals nine.

33:09.334 --> 33:11.901
And nine plus 14 is also 23.

33:11.901 --> 33:14.467
14 is one plus four which equals five.

33:14.567 --> 33:16.634
And five plus 18 is 23 too.

33:16.634 --> 33:18.867
Oh my god.
- All right, Robin,

33:18.867 --> 33:20.333
Please don't you start this nonsense.

33:20.433 --> 33:23.976
This is not nonsense!
I-i mean, five plus...

33:24.076 --> 33:24.734
18 is 23.

33:24.834 --> 33:27.533
Well, if the book were 27 or 150,

33:27.533 --> 33:29.700
you could do the same thing.

33:29.700 --> 33:33.001
18 plus 14 is 32.

33:33.001 --> 33:35.201
23 reversed.

33:35.201 --> 33:37.201
Spooky, huh?

33:39.700 --> 33:41.767
'Chapter 7:

33:41.767 --> 33:44.767
The suicide blonde had given Fabrizia a taste...

33:44.867 --> 33:45.901
for new thrills.

33:46.001 --> 33:47.867
I played along,

33:47.967 --> 33:50.867
but all I could think about was the number.'

33:50.967 --> 33:53.134
Thanks.

33:53.134 --> 33:55.134
'I didn't tell her...

33:55.134 --> 33:58.209
that the clock behind the desk read 9:14.

34:02.834 --> 34:05.309
Just rip it open.
Just rip it off.

34:14.101 --> 34:16.934
Pretend you have a knife.
Pretend you have a knife.

34:17.034 --> 34:18.567
Come on.

34:26.567 --> 34:30.234
I know you're gonna hurt me.

34:30.234 --> 34:32.767
You shut up, bitch,

34:32.767 --> 34:35.101
or you die.

34:35.101 --> 34:36.646
'Of course I would never...

34:36.746 --> 34:37.534
really harm Fabrizia.

34:37.634 --> 34:41.201
I loved her.
And I thought she loved me.'

35:19.600 --> 35:22.375
'But I started having...

35:22.425 --> 35:24.425
terrible nightmares.'

36:15.101 --> 36:18.304
Eight, nine, 10,

36:18.404 --> 36:19.600
11, 12, 13--

36:19.700 --> 36:21.700
What are you doing?

36:22.834 --> 36:25.134
Reading.

36:25.134 --> 36:28.301
You're insane.

37:22.667 --> 37:25.334
Isaac?
- Simply put,

37:25.334 --> 37:26.967
It's a box that collects...

37:27.067 --> 37:30.167
Orgone energy.

37:30.167 --> 37:32.872
We'll talk about Wilhelm Reich next week.

37:32.972 --> 37:34.333
Thank you for coming.

37:34.433 --> 37:37.433
Well, it sounds like a fascinating read.

37:37.433 --> 37:39.300
Of course there exist far too few books...

37:39.400 --> 37:41.214
where the main character plays...

37:41.314 --> 37:42.134
the saxophone.

37:42.234 --> 37:44.101
I wasn't aware you also played.

37:44.201 --> 37:45.300
I don't.
That's just it,

37:45.400 --> 37:46.400
it doesn't all match.

37:46.500 --> 37:49.834
It's the number.
I’m seeing it everywhere.

37:49.834 --> 37:52.234
Well, conspiracy buffs would say, 'of course.

37:52.334 --> 37:55.333
After all, the world spins in an axis of 23°.'

37:55.433 --> 37:57.801
When you tell them it's
actually 23.5, they say...

37:57.901 --> 38:00.967
five is simply two plus three.

38:03.201 --> 38:04.856
23 is very good...

38:04.956 --> 38:06.367
at this particular game.

38:06.467 --> 38:09.433
Game?
- Yeah, paranoia.

38:11.301 --> 38:13.758
There's a fair bit of
literature on the 23 enigma.

38:13.858 --> 38:14.268
There is?

38:14.368 --> 38:17.533
There are 23 axioms to Euclid's geometry.

38:18.800 --> 38:22.101
The human body consists of 46 chromosomes--...

38:22.201 --> 38:24.500
23 from each parent.

38:24.500 --> 38:28.201
Blood takes 23 seconds to circulate.

38:28.201 --> 38:30.201
The Mayans believed the end of the world...

38:30.301 --> 38:33.767
would occur December 12th, 2012.

38:33.767 --> 38:35.867
20 plus 12 is?

38:35.867 --> 38:38.101
23 reversed.

38:38.101 --> 38:40.634
Or 20 plus one plus two.

38:40.634 --> 38:42.268
So what is this?

38:42.368 --> 38:44.967
What is 23?

38:44.967 --> 38:47.834
Is it...

38:47.834 --> 38:49.901
God?

38:49.901 --> 38:51.567
Two divided by three--...

38:51.667 --> 38:54.034
.666.

38:54.034 --> 38:57.567
666, the number of the devil.

38:57.567 --> 39:00.567
There are only 22 chapters
In the book of revelations.

39:00.667 --> 39:04.201
We all know how that ends.

39:04.201 --> 39:06.400
So is 23 a blessing or a curse?

39:06.500 --> 39:08.152
What's true is that there's a select group...

39:08.252 --> 39:08.567
of people...

39:08.667 --> 39:10.879
that take delight in perpetuating...

39:10.979 --> 39:12.300
the number's infamy.

39:12.400 --> 39:15.234
Lucky seven,
unlucky 13,

39:15.234 --> 39:17.567
ballplayers,
lucky shoes.

39:17.567 --> 39:19.818
People only pray because
they believe that god...

39:19.918 --> 39:21.168
will help them if they do.

39:21.268 --> 39:24.067
This is magical thinking,

39:24.067 --> 39:25.690
non-scientific causal reasoning.

39:25.790 --> 39:26.367
Now you're--...

39:26.467 --> 39:29.300
you're looking for 23 so you're finding it.

39:29.400 --> 39:32.346
Agatha thinks

39:32.446 --> 39:33.333
I’m nuts.

39:33.433 --> 39:36.201
Finish the book.

39:37.400 --> 39:39.801
And if after reading it in its entirety,

39:39.901 --> 39:41.400
you still believe the subject to be you,

39:41.500 --> 39:43.067
then whoever wrote it knows you very well.

39:43.167 --> 39:45.734
And only they can give you your answer.

39:45.834 --> 39:48.268
That's a good idea.
- And in the meantime

39:48.368 --> 39:50.918
I can speak to Agatha,
if you like.

39:52.167 --> 39:53.834
Hmm.

39:59.101 --> 40:01.400
The number was everywhere.

40:01.500 --> 40:04.901
You have 23 pairs of shoes.

40:06.500 --> 40:09.001
You're counting my shoes?

40:18.167 --> 40:20.067
What are you doing?
- Reading.

40:20.167 --> 40:22.167
You're insane.

40:36.167 --> 40:38.499
'Night after night I killed

40:38.599 --> 40:39.767
Fabrizia in my dreams.

40:39.867 --> 40:42.853
I explained to the department
shrink what her full name...

40:42.953 --> 40:43.634
added up to.'

40:43.734 --> 40:45.734
23.
- What do you think...

40:45.761 --> 40:46.600
that means?

40:46.700 --> 40:49.101
I don't know,
Miles.

40:51.201 --> 40:54.167
Maybe I should be a fucking accountant.

40:54.167 --> 40:56.276
'The wise Dr. Phoenix...

40:56.376 --> 40:57.901
recommends I take a break.'

40:58.001 --> 41:00.533
Maybe you should take a break.

41:00.533 --> 41:01.994
'Like time is gonna...

41:02.094 --> 41:02.433
heal me.'

41:02.533 --> 41:05.201
Time is a-- a gentle man.

41:05.201 --> 41:07.108
'Time is just a counting...

41:07.208 --> 41:07.500
system,

41:07.600 --> 41:10.101
numbers with meaning attached to them.

41:10.201 --> 41:12.760
Still, a break is what he prescribes.

41:12.860 --> 41:13.867
He called it--'

41:13.967 --> 41:16.634
emotional leave.

41:16.634 --> 41:19.634
So you're not a detective anymore.

41:19.634 --> 41:22.534
'Fabrizia was not impressed.'

41:22.634 --> 41:25.268
I’m a detective on vacation.

41:27.867 --> 41:29.692
And you don't...

41:29.792 --> 41:31.792
have a gun?

41:33.368 --> 41:34.767
I still have these.

41:34.867 --> 41:37.517
Maybe you should just get some sleep...

41:37.617 --> 41:39.617
tonight.

41:50.767 --> 41:53.034
'The number was everywhere.

41:53.134 --> 41:54.767
At this point,

41:54.867 --> 41:57.268
I don't need to tell you...

41:57.268 --> 41:59.668
how many pairs of shoes she had.

42:12.667 --> 42:15.667
What are these shoes doing in the trash?

42:17.201 --> 42:19.800
Did you know you had 23 pair?

42:19.800 --> 42:22.268
Oh!

42:22.268 --> 42:24.600
You're insane!

42:24.600 --> 42:27.934
The Hiroshima bomb was dropped at 8:15.

42:27.934 --> 42:31.700
Eight plus 15 is 23.

42:31.700 --> 42:33.600
Waco, Texas,
And the Oklahoma city bombing...

42:33.700 --> 42:36.134
both happened on April 19th.

42:36.134 --> 42:38.567
Four plus 19 is 23.

42:38.567 --> 42:41.967
Tropic of cancer,
23.5° north;

42:41.967 --> 42:44.567
Capricorn 23.5° south.

42:44.567 --> 42:48.334
10886 is the number Al Capone wore...

42:48.334 --> 42:51.634
on his uniform in prison.

42:51.634 --> 42:55.084
Ted Bundy was executed on the 23rd of January.

42:59.734 --> 43:02.001
It's all 23.

43:03.234 --> 43:05.367
'She didn't understand,

43:05.467 --> 43:08.242
which was fine because neither did I.

43:09.800 --> 43:11.901
All I knew was...

43:11.901 --> 43:14.234
the number had gone after suicide blonde,

43:14.334 --> 43:16.533
Isabel Lydia Hunt.

43:21.034 --> 43:23.301
Now it was coming after me.'

43:23.301 --> 43:26.301
I can speak to Fabrizia if you like.

43:29.368 --> 43:32.143
'I believe he said it...

43:32.193 --> 43:34.518
in total innocence at the time.

43:53.834 --> 43:55.834
But looking back...'

43:55.834 --> 43:58.234
I can speak to Fabrizia if you like.

43:58.334 --> 44:01.184
'...I wish I had reacted differently.'

44:30.934 --> 44:33.134
'I should have realized the truth.

44:33.234 --> 44:36.368
I know it's absurd,

44:36.368 --> 44:39.668
but even the color of his tie betrayed him.'

44:45.201 --> 44:46.834
Do you know what pink is?

44:46.934 --> 44:50.334
Red 27, white 65.
65 plus 27-- 92.

44:50.334 --> 44:52.967
Pink has four letters.
92 divided by four...

44:53.067 --> 44:55.667
Twenty-fucking-three!

44:57.067 --> 45:00.067
In the meantime,
I can speak to Agatha...

45:00.112 --> 45:00.934
if you like.

45:01.034 --> 45:03.431
..paranoia. 23 is very good...

45:03.531 --> 45:03.934
at this...

45:04.034 --> 45:05.767
Paranoia, paranoia.

45:05.867 --> 45:07.801
In the meantime,
I can speak to Agatha...

45:07.901 --> 45:09.934
if you like.

45:09.934 --> 45:12.059
...of an axis of 23°.
When you tell them it's...

45:12.159 --> 45:12.801
actually 23.5,

45:12.901 --> 45:16.167
They say five is simply two plus three.

45:39.134 --> 45:40.879
In the meantime,

45:40.979 --> 45:42.467
I can speak to Agatha...

45:42.567 --> 45:45.001
if you like.

45:55.268 --> 45:57.593
'Chapter 21...'

48:23.167 --> 48:25.234
Oh, god!

48:28.034 --> 48:30.034
Ag!

48:30.667 --> 48:33.567
Oh, god!
Oh, god!

48:39.034 --> 48:41.201
It's a nightmare.
It's a nightmare.

48:41.301 --> 48:44.268
It's a nightmare.
It's gonna be all right.

48:44.368 --> 48:46.734
No!

48:46.734 --> 48:48.067
No!

49:48.433 --> 49:51.034
Ag, I don't want you...

49:51.134 --> 49:53.134
to be worried.

49:53.134 --> 49:56.059
I just need one night to clear my head.

49:57.600 --> 49:59.800
Please don't give up on me.

49:59.800 --> 50:02.168
Your loving dog-catching husband,

50:02.268 --> 50:04.268
Walter.

50:22.001 --> 50:23.767
Why that street?

50:23.867 --> 50:26.334
Why that hotel?

50:27.533 --> 50:29.700
Like it was my choice.

50:53.734 --> 50:55.316
Morning.
- What can I do...

50:55.416 --> 50:55.934
for you?

50:56.034 --> 50:59.334
Yeah, um, I’d, um...

50:59.334 --> 51:01.433
Like a room.

51:01.433 --> 51:03.433
Sign the register.

51:08.800 --> 51:10.800
27's the quietest.

51:13.201 --> 51:15.800
What about 23?

51:15.800 --> 51:19.200
We've been experiencing
some plumbing problems...

51:19.300 --> 51:21.300
with 23.

51:50.834 --> 51:54.234
Chapter 22 was as I feared.

53:13.834 --> 53:17.101
Tropic of capricorn.

53:39.167 --> 53:41.167
It wasn't the happiest...

53:41.233 --> 53:41.767
of endings.

53:41.867 --> 53:43.634
It wasn't an ending at all.

53:43.734 --> 53:46.901
After chapter 22,
there was nothing...

53:46.901 --> 53:49.334
but the question.

53:49.334 --> 53:52.334
Did the number live to kill another day?

53:52.334 --> 53:55.109
The number had gone after Fingerling.

53:55.967 --> 53:58.313
and now it was coming after me.

54:02.834 --> 54:04.834
You.

54:07.734 --> 54:11.409
It's all your fault.
If you hadn't made me late...

54:33.567 --> 54:36.600
All right,
this suits me fine.

54:40.667 --> 54:43.667
A place to rest in peace.

54:45.567 --> 54:48.201
Yes!

54:51.467 --> 54:54.334
I got you,
you son of a bitch.

54:54.334 --> 54:56.334
It's okay, boy.

54:56.334 --> 54:57.648
You'll get up in a couple of hours

54:57.748 --> 54:58.500
With a bad headache.

54:58.600 --> 55:00.734
That's all.

55:02.034 --> 55:05.634
Not so tough now,
are you, nasty evil dog?

55:07.067 --> 55:09.834
Ned.

55:09.834 --> 55:13.101
L, m, n-- 14.

55:13.101 --> 55:16.634
A, b, c, d, e...

55:19.400 --> 55:21.400
Shit.

55:24.634 --> 55:27.467
Ned, Ned!

55:27.467 --> 55:28.867
I’m Father Sebastian.

55:28.967 --> 55:30.600
I trust there's an explanation for this.

55:30.700 --> 55:32.793
He's just sleeping,
Father. I’m an...

55:32.893 --> 55:33.700
animal control officer.

55:33.800 --> 55:36.097
Is this your dog?
- It belongs to Barnaby,

55:36.197 --> 55:36.834
My gardener.

55:36.934 --> 55:39.634
Don't worry,
Barnaby, he's all right.

55:39.684 --> 55:41.684
He's just sleeping.

55:46.067 --> 55:48.168
Why did you name him Ned?
- He didn't.

55:48.268 --> 55:50.034
He-- he took Ned in as a stray.

55:50.134 --> 55:53.268
He likes graveyards.
He sits and watches

55:53.368 --> 55:54.034
The stones...

55:54.134 --> 55:57.034
like he was watching over them.

55:57.034 --> 55:58.976
That's how he got his nickname--...

55:59.076 --> 56:00.333
guardian of the dead.

56:00.433 --> 56:02.634
Lately it's been this one.

56:07.167 --> 56:09.834
Oh, no way.

56:09.834 --> 56:12.134
What's wrong, son?

56:13.400 --> 56:15.867
She died on her 23rd birthday.

56:15.867 --> 56:17.567
Well, we can only assume.

56:17.667 --> 56:20.934
What?
- That she died.

56:20.934 --> 56:24.001
They never found her body.
This is only a marker.

56:24.101 --> 56:26.549
Where have you been?
- Library. It's not...

56:26.649 --> 56:27.367
just a book.

56:27.467 --> 56:30.600
It's true, the number screws with your mind,

56:30.700 --> 56:33.400
makes you do...

56:33.400 --> 56:34.967
terrible things.

56:35.067 --> 56:37.901
Perhaps I should be going.

56:37.901 --> 56:41.500
No, I want you to see this, all of you.

56:41.500 --> 56:43.927
There was a college girl named Laura Tollins...

56:44.027 --> 56:44.934
who was murdered.

56:45.034 --> 56:47.234
They never found her body,

56:47.234 --> 56:50.400
but her bed was soaked in so much blood.

56:50.400 --> 56:52.901
This is the man who killed her, Kyle Flinch.

56:53.001 --> 56:54.658
Police found a murder weapon,

56:54.758 --> 56:55.767
a butcher's knife,

56:55.867 --> 56:57.767
with his prints all over it.

56:57.867 --> 56:59.229
Well, Walter,
this was nearly...

56:59.329 --> 56:59.934
15 years ago.

57:00.034 --> 57:02.797
Ag, he wasn't just her psychology professor.

57:02.897 --> 57:03.934
They were lovers.

57:04.034 --> 57:07.268
Everything they did together sexually...

57:07.268 --> 57:09.168
was exactly like the characters in the book.

57:09.268 --> 57:11.967
He said it was her idea to buy the knife.

57:12.067 --> 57:15.867
She wanted to fake an attack.

57:15.867 --> 57:19.867
Kyle Flinch is Topsy Kretts.

57:19.867 --> 57:22.567
The book is his...

57:22.567 --> 57:25.467
warped literary confession.

57:27.533 --> 57:30.400
Agatha said a-a dog told you this.

57:30.400 --> 57:33.634
Ned isn't just a dog.

57:33.634 --> 57:35.884
He's the guardian of the dead.

57:37.034 --> 57:37.951
But what about...

57:38.051 --> 57:38.600
all these 23s...

57:38.700 --> 57:40.201
in-in-in your name and everything?

57:40.301 --> 57:42.476
Is it all just a coincidence?

57:42.526 --> 57:44.333
I don't know.

57:44.433 --> 57:46.458
but I know who can tell me.

58:04.567 --> 58:07.201
Well, you're two days early.

58:09.268 --> 58:11.268
You knew I would come?

58:15.967 --> 58:18.134
Reporters always come on the 10th.

58:18.234 --> 58:19.967
The day you killed Laura Tollins.

58:20.067 --> 58:22.901
The day she was taken from me.

58:22.901 --> 58:26.301
I’m not a reporter.
My name is Walter Sparrow.

58:26.301 --> 58:28.600
I was born February 3rd.

58:30.167 --> 58:33.667
Happy belated birthday.

58:33.667 --> 58:36.467
February 3rd.
2/3.

58:36.467 --> 58:38.570
Yeah.
- Don't pretend

58:38.670 --> 58:40.134
You don't know,

58:40.234 --> 58:43.067
Topsy Kretts.
I read your book.

58:43.067 --> 58:45.700
Tell me about the number.

58:45.700 --> 58:47.767
Is that why you killed her?

58:47.767 --> 58:50.467
I need to know.
You have to tell me.

58:55.667 --> 58:59.134
What happened to you?
I’m afraid it's happening to me.

58:59.234 --> 59:01.433
What happened to me?

59:06.268 --> 59:08.305
You want to know the worst thing about...

59:08.405 --> 59:09.234
being in prison?

59:09.334 --> 59:13.101
Your family, your sister,
your parents,

59:13.101 --> 59:15.400
they come to visit you.

59:15.400 --> 59:17.834
Over time, though,
the visits get less...

59:17.934 --> 59:20.634
and your sister stops coming at all.

59:21.767 --> 59:24.204
Then you start to notice
your mother won't look you...

59:24.304 --> 59:24.801
in the eye.

59:24.901 --> 59:27.967
Pretty soon,
she stops coming too.

59:29.500 --> 59:30.901
Eventually, your--...

59:31.001 --> 59:33.426
your father tells you your sister...

59:33.526 --> 59:35.300
had a breakdown...

59:35.400 --> 59:38.034
unable to deal with having a murderer...

59:38.134 --> 59:39.967
for a brother.

59:40.067 --> 59:41.681
Now there's tears in his eyes when...

59:41.781 --> 59:42.367
he says this,

59:42.467 --> 59:45.867
but he's not sad.

59:45.867 --> 59:48.400
He's angry.

59:48.400 --> 59:51.250
That's the last time you ever see him.

59:53.734 --> 59:56.967
I didn't kill Laura.

59:56.967 --> 59:59.101
I loved her.

59:59.101 --> 1:00:02.176
And I didn't write a book about a number.

1:00:05.001 --> 1:00:07.667
You're lying.

1:00:07.667 --> 1:00:10.892
I’m in prison for a crime I did not commit,

1:00:10.942 --> 1:00:12.942
Mr. Sparrow.

1:00:14.268 --> 1:00:16.993
But somehow I think your problems are...

1:00:17.093 --> 1:00:19.093
bigger than mine.

1:00:20.268 --> 1:00:23.101
Fucking liar!

1:00:25.334 --> 1:00:27.901
No.
Yeah, no.

1:00:31.001 --> 1:00:33.301
If I was to write a book,

1:00:33.301 --> 1:00:37.126
I wouldn't use a ridiculous
name like 'top secrets.'

1:01:00.834 --> 1:01:03.034
He was real convincing about his innocence.

1:01:03.134 --> 1:01:04.967
Well, killers usually are.

1:01:05.067 --> 1:01:07.168
His fingerprints were on the knife.

1:01:07.268 --> 1:01:08.733
Her blood was on his hands when...

1:01:08.833 --> 1:01:09.467
he dialed 911.

1:01:09.567 --> 1:01:13.134
No, he's innocent.

1:01:15.967 --> 1:01:18.234
All because his name doesn't add up to 23?

1:01:18.334 --> 1:01:20.448
The real killer,
the author, he's still...

1:01:20.548 --> 1:01:21.067
out there.

1:01:21.167 --> 1:01:23.400
I have to find him.

1:01:23.400 --> 1:01:26.625
Wait, I--I--I--I know how you can find him.

1:01:32.700 --> 1:01:34.416
Last night w-when I was...

1:01:34.516 --> 1:01:35.467
reading the book,

1:01:35.567 --> 1:01:38.492
I found a p.o. box address in the back.

1:01:46.167 --> 1:01:48.380
Are you sure you don't want anything in this?

1:01:48.480 --> 1:01:49.134
Just the snow.

1:01:49.234 --> 1:01:51.120
When do you want it to get there?

1:01:51.220 --> 1:01:52.168
Tomorrow morning.

1:01:52.268 --> 1:01:54.767
It'll have to go express.
- Fine.

1:01:54.767 --> 1:01:56.234
Is that all?

1:01:56.334 --> 1:01:58.368
No no, we want a--...

1:01:58.368 --> 1:02:00.934
we want 23 of them.

1:02:04.700 --> 1:02:08.101
I dreamt that I killed you, Ag.

1:02:08.101 --> 1:02:11.239
Fingerling had the same dream about--

1:02:11.339 --> 1:02:11.534
Shh.

1:02:11.634 --> 1:02:14.533
I’m going with you today.

1:02:14.533 --> 1:02:17.308
And all this is gonna come to an end.

1:02:19.101 --> 1:02:21.201
You wouldn't hurt me,
Walter.

1:02:23.167 --> 1:02:26.600
You wouldn't hurt anyone ever.

1:02:30.400 --> 1:02:32.500
How do you know?

1:02:41.368 --> 1:02:43.433
There's your boxes,
kiddo.

1:02:43.433 --> 1:02:46.268
Now we'll see if somebody shows up.

1:02:47.734 --> 1:02:51.634
This may not be the author.
He may not even be a man.

1:02:52.001 --> 1:02:55.533
Well, we'll know soon enough.

1:03:18.934 --> 1:03:20.934
Walter, look.
- Huh?

1:03:20.934 --> 1:03:22.934
Somebody's gone in.

1:03:25.400 --> 1:03:27.534
That's him.
I-it's gotta be him.

1:03:27.634 --> 1:03:31.101
You think?
- Yeah, I mean, look at him.

1:03:31.101 --> 1:03:33.134
It's gotta be him.

1:03:39.533 --> 1:03:41.567
Game's over,
Topsy Kretts.

1:03:52.167 --> 1:03:55.334
You sh-- should be dead.

1:03:57.067 --> 1:03:59.067
You should be dead!

1:04:01.433 --> 1:04:04.634
Walter, no!
- I’m calling the cops!

1:04:04.634 --> 1:04:07.634
Stop!
Who are you?

1:04:07.634 --> 1:04:10.167
The number,
what does it mean?

1:04:10.167 --> 1:04:12.734
I think you know.

1:04:16.268 --> 1:04:17.410
Oh my god.
Get an ambulance!

1:04:17.510 --> 1:04:17.901
Watch out!

1:04:18.001 --> 1:04:21.967
Dear god.
- Get an ambulance!

1:04:21.967 --> 1:04:23.667
Don't you die on me.

1:04:23.767 --> 1:04:26.201
You hear me?
Don't you die.

1:04:26.201 --> 1:04:28.067
Walter, please.

1:04:28.167 --> 1:04:30.387
He's the only person that can help us get...

1:04:30.487 --> 1:04:31.268
back to normal.

1:04:31.368 --> 1:04:33.201
Honey, you're not helping, okay?

1:04:33.301 --> 1:04:35.071
Now I want you to take Robin...

1:04:35.171 --> 1:04:35.901
and go home.

1:04:36.001 --> 1:04:37.767
This man needs a hospital.

1:04:37.867 --> 1:04:41.134
I’ll take care of it.
- But he knows, hon.

1:04:41.134 --> 1:04:43.301
Take Robin and go home.

1:04:43.301 --> 1:04:47.101
I said I’ll take care of it.

1:04:52.500 --> 1:04:53.934
He knows.

1:04:54.034 --> 1:04:56.134
Shit!

1:04:56.134 --> 1:04:58.234
Hard to get rid of...

1:04:58.234 --> 1:05:01.167
What?
- I was insane.

1:05:01.167 --> 1:05:02.734
What was driving you insane?

1:05:02.834 --> 1:05:05.667
Hard...

1:05:05.667 --> 1:05:08.467
to get rid of...

1:05:10.867 --> 1:05:13.301
The institute.

1:05:13.301 --> 1:05:16.400
Go there.

1:05:16.400 --> 1:05:17.967
You'll see.

1:05:18.067 --> 1:05:20.700
Oh my god.

1:05:32.634 --> 1:05:35.034
Agatha.
- Walter, he didn't make it.

1:05:35.134 --> 1:05:36.634
I’m so sorry.

1:05:36.734 --> 1:05:38.934
Well, did he say anything?

1:05:38.934 --> 1:05:41.901
No, I’m sorry.

1:05:41.901 --> 1:05:44.533
Did you find out who he was?

1:05:44.533 --> 1:05:47.101
No.

1:05:47.101 --> 1:05:50.268
I’ll be home in a little while.

1:07:22.467 --> 1:07:23.767
Oh, shit!

1:07:23.867 --> 1:07:26.533
You gotta be kidding me.

1:07:28.967 --> 1:07:30.967
Robin!

1:08:29.101 --> 1:08:31.934
Every 23rd word on every 23rd page:

1:08:31.934 --> 1:08:35.109
'Visit Casanova spark,
Dig beneath the steps...

1:08:35.209 --> 1:08:37.034
to heaven.'

1:08:37.134 --> 1:08:40.001
Who's Casanova spark?
- It's not a person.

1:08:40.101 --> 1:08:43.326
'I warn you, hell is waiting, Sparrow man.'

1:08:44.467 --> 1:08:46.734
We need to go.

1:09:23.134 --> 1:09:25.134
23!

1:09:38.533 --> 1:09:41.233
What was driving you insane?

1:10:13.667 --> 1:10:16.667
Wanna take bets that there's 23 of them?

1:10:22.334 --> 1:10:25.201
20, 21, 22...

1:10:29.901 --> 1:10:32.226
Are you sure you wanna do this?

1:10:34.533 --> 1:10:38.067
What if mom was right?

1:10:38.067 --> 1:10:39.801
Wh-wh-what if-- what if
the man wasn't the author?

1:10:39.901 --> 1:10:42.385
What-- what if he was just the guy's father...

1:10:42.485 --> 1:10:43.201
or something?

1:10:43.301 --> 1:10:45.734
Sounds like a lot of what ifs.

1:10:45.734 --> 1:10:48.759
Wouldn't that mean that the real killer's...

1:10:48.859 --> 1:10:50.859
still out there?

1:10:56.834 --> 1:10:59.867
Did you hear something?

1:11:01.001 --> 1:11:04.001
You're starting to sound like me, kiddo.

1:11:10.667 --> 1:11:13.400
Gimme the light.
Gimme the light.

1:11:16.101 --> 1:11:19.533
Oh, my--

1:11:26.667 --> 1:11:30.567
Okay, we gotta go.
Go!

1:11:30.567 --> 1:11:32.875
Give me the light.
Let's get out...

1:11:32.975 --> 1:11:34.975
of here.

1:11:42.967 --> 1:11:45.292
There's one right there.

1:11:45.391 --> 1:11:45.700
Where?

1:11:50.268 --> 1:11:52.334
You stay here!

1:11:54.334 --> 1:11:57.001
911.
What's your emergency?

1:11:57.001 --> 1:11:59.201
You need to send someone...

1:11:59.201 --> 1:12:01.201
to Casanova's park.

1:12:05.533 --> 1:12:08.767
Is this your idea of a joke?

1:12:08.767 --> 1:12:10.901
It's empty.

1:12:14.667 --> 1:12:16.667
What?

1:12:18.134 --> 1:12:20.467
It was right there.

1:12:20.467 --> 1:12:22.937
We're not crazy.
We circled every 23rd word...

1:12:23.037 --> 1:12:24.067
on every 23rd page...

1:12:24.167 --> 1:12:25.420
and it told us to come down here.

1:12:25.520 --> 1:12:25.667
Yeah.

1:12:25.767 --> 1:12:27.728
And I sound completely crazy,

1:12:27.828 --> 1:12:28.333
don't I?

1:12:28.433 --> 1:12:29.524
Just get some sleep, okay?

1:12:29.624 --> 1:12:30.067
We're done here.

1:12:30.167 --> 1:12:32.467
10-23, u.t.l.

1:12:35.834 --> 1:12:37.834
Mom.

1:12:39.467 --> 1:12:41.767
Oh, honey.

1:12:49.067 --> 1:12:52.368
Let's go home, okay?
- Yeah.

1:13:01.834 --> 1:13:04.333
Skeletons can't just get up and walk away.

1:13:04.433 --> 1:13:06.901
You were right.
That man wasn't the killer.

1:13:07.001 --> 1:13:08.700
The real killer is still out there...

1:13:08.800 --> 1:13:10.900
and he knows dad's onto him.

1:13:12.800 --> 1:13:14.901
The book, it's got all these-- these--...

1:13:15.001 --> 1:13:16.901
these secret messages every 23rd page.

1:13:17.001 --> 1:13:18.308
He's right, every 23rd page in the book.

1:13:18.408 --> 1:13:18.901
Stop it!

1:13:19.001 --> 1:13:20.281
Yes.
- Both of you, stop it!

1:13:20.381 --> 1:13:21.168
Now listen to me.

1:13:21.268 --> 1:13:24.433
23 is a number, okay?
There's no magical meaning.

1:13:24.533 --> 1:13:26.001
Only people can give it that.

1:13:26.101 --> 1:13:27.568
And I don't care how many lunatics...

1:13:27.668 --> 1:13:28.734
are fantasizing about 23.

1:13:28.834 --> 1:13:30.901
They're wrong!
There's no curse.

1:13:31.001 --> 1:13:33.767
There's no killer running around out there.

1:13:33.867 --> 1:13:36.342
Jesus.

1:13:40.634 --> 1:13:42.634
It's him.

1:13:44.800 --> 1:13:47.234
That's Ned.

1:13:51.700 --> 1:13:55.234
Nasty evil dead dog.

1:13:59.734 --> 1:14:03.067
Dad!
- Walter!

1:14:29.867 --> 1:14:31.867
You.

1:14:33.433 --> 1:14:36.067
It was you.

1:14:36.067 --> 1:14:38.067
You moved the skeleton.

1:14:39.967 --> 1:14:41.134
Please don't do this, Walter.

1:14:41.234 --> 1:14:43.559
Then how did you know,
unless...

1:14:47.867 --> 1:14:50.134
Your maiden name is Pink.

1:14:50.134 --> 1:14:51.801
Do you know what pink is?

1:14:51.901 --> 1:14:55.101
Red and white,
92 divided by 4.

1:14:57.067 --> 1:14:58.783
Someday I’m gonna write a book and I’ll do it...

1:14:58.883 --> 1:14:59.500
to somebody else.

1:14:59.600 --> 1:15:01.634
Walter.
- Oh, god.

1:15:01.634 --> 1:15:03.067
Whoever wrote it knows you very well,

1:15:03.167 --> 1:15:04.801
and only they can give you your answers.

1:15:04.901 --> 1:15:08.167
You wrote it.

1:15:09.767 --> 1:15:11.268
Isaac knew all along,
didn't he?

1:15:11.368 --> 1:15:14.667
Walter, just let it be, please.

1:15:14.667 --> 1:15:16.367
You're Topsy Kretts.

1:15:16.467 --> 1:15:17.867
He may not even be a man.

1:15:17.967 --> 1:15:21.268
Don't make me do this.
- Why, Ag?

1:15:23.834 --> 1:15:25.867
Why'd you do this?

1:15:27.368 --> 1:15:30.224
Who have I been living with?

1:15:30.324 --> 1:15:32.324
Walter.

1:15:38.400 --> 1:15:40.400
What's this for, Ag?

1:15:41.600 --> 1:15:43.667
What were you gonna do with this?

1:15:43.767 --> 1:15:45.534
I--

1:15:45.634 --> 1:15:48.134
I took it to protect us...

1:15:48.134 --> 1:15:51.095
from whoever we were gonna
meet at the mailbox...

1:15:51.195 --> 1:15:51.734
facility.

1:15:51.834 --> 1:15:53.912
Intending to kill that poor
old man who you got...

1:15:54.012 --> 1:15:54.867
to publish your book...

1:15:54.967 --> 1:15:56.767
and protect your little secret?

1:15:56.867 --> 1:15:59.570
I’ll take care of it.
- He was alive before...

1:15:59.670 --> 1:16:00.734
you sent us away.

1:16:00.834 --> 1:16:03.395
Robin will hear you.
- Oh, we wouldn't want that,

1:16:03.495 --> 1:16:03.934
would we?

1:16:04.034 --> 1:16:06.310
Wouldn't want our son
to know the horrible truth...

1:16:06.410 --> 1:16:07.201
about his mother.

1:16:07.301 --> 1:16:09.134
Mom, dad, what's going on?

1:16:09.234 --> 1:16:11.101
She's Topsy Kretts.
She wrote the book.

1:16:11.201 --> 1:16:13.770
No, it's not true.
Now your father's gonna...

1:16:13.870 --> 1:16:15.034
put down the knife.

1:16:15.134 --> 1:16:17.734
Aren't you, Walter?
- Tell him the truth.

1:16:17.834 --> 1:16:19.900
Walter.
- Tell him how you took...

1:16:20.000 --> 1:16:20.867
the skeleton.

1:16:20.967 --> 1:16:24.134
Yes, Isaac and I took the skeleton.

1:16:24.134 --> 1:16:26.433
You did?
- And I’d do it again.

1:16:26.433 --> 1:16:28.367
But I did not write the book.

1:16:28.467 --> 1:16:30.967
Don't lie.
13 years, Ag.

1:16:30.967 --> 1:16:32.268
13 years of lies!

1:16:32.368 --> 1:16:34.400
No more.
- Don't do this to us, Walter.

1:16:34.500 --> 1:16:37.067
Mom, who wrote the book?
- Tell him who wrote it.

1:16:37.167 --> 1:16:40.001
Tell him.

1:16:40.001 --> 1:16:42.500
You wrote the book,
Walter.

1:16:54.667 --> 1:16:57.592
I found this with the old man's things.

1:17:07.800 --> 1:17:10.201
You put my name on this.

1:17:10.201 --> 1:17:12.201
No.

1:17:12.867 --> 1:17:15.201
No no no no no.

1:17:15.201 --> 1:17:16.734
You're lying.

1:17:16.834 --> 1:17:19.416
She's lying.
I didn't-- I didn't...

1:17:19.516 --> 1:17:20.300
write that.

1:17:20.400 --> 1:17:22.400
Then who did?

1:17:24.101 --> 1:17:26.101
You.

1:17:27.834 --> 1:17:30.827
It was both of you all the way along,

1:17:30.927 --> 1:17:31.600
wasn't it?

1:17:31.700 --> 1:17:34.067
No.
- What is this?

1:17:34.067 --> 1:17:36.067
What are you doing?

1:18:03.433 --> 1:18:05.433
Dad.

1:18:07.167 --> 1:18:09.167
Dad, what's happening?

1:18:12.234 --> 1:18:14.834
Walter, we can get you help.

1:18:17.101 --> 1:18:18.734
The woman in red.

1:18:18.834 --> 1:18:22.134
And this is supposed to make...

1:18:22.184 --> 1:18:24.184
me feel better how?

1:18:25.700 --> 1:18:28.533
Oh my god.
Shit!

1:18:33.433 --> 1:18:35.433
Walter.

1:18:43.700 --> 1:18:47.533
No!
Get out of here!

1:18:47.533 --> 1:18:49.201
Get your car.
Come on.

1:18:49.301 --> 1:18:51.776
Let's go.
- Come on, honey.

1:20:14.433 --> 1:20:17.101
'Chapter 23:

1:20:17.101 --> 1:20:20.201
You can call me Fingerling,

1:20:20.201 --> 1:20:23.767
but my real name is Walter.

1:20:23.767 --> 1:20:27.567
Walter Paul Sparrow.

1:20:27.567 --> 1:20:30.801
What you have read so far
is not the whole truth.

1:20:30.901 --> 1:20:34.567
Much has been changed to protect the innocent...

1:20:34.567 --> 1:20:36.600
and the guilty.

1:20:42.334 --> 1:20:43.844
I once read that the only philosophical...

1:20:43.944 --> 1:20:44.734
question that matters...

1:20:44.834 --> 1:20:47.567
is whether or not to commit suicide.

1:20:49.134 --> 1:20:51.834
I guess that makes me a philosopher.

1:20:53.967 --> 1:20:56.367
You could say it was my inheritance.

1:20:56.467 --> 1:20:58.967
After my mother's death...

1:20:58.967 --> 1:21:01.167
my father couldn't cope.

1:21:06.134 --> 1:21:08.134
He didn't leave a note.

1:21:09.500 --> 1:21:11.500
Just a number.

1:21:13.533 --> 1:21:15.641
That number followed me from foster home...

1:21:15.741 --> 1:21:16.500
to foster home,

1:21:16.600 --> 1:21:19.334
till college when I met her.

1:21:19.334 --> 1:21:21.334
Laura Tollins.

1:21:40.467 --> 1:21:42.467
Do it tight.

1:21:44.967 --> 1:21:47.734
Pretend that you have a knife.

1:21:47.734 --> 1:21:49.534
I got a knife.

1:21:49.634 --> 1:21:51.433
Cut my shirt.

1:21:51.533 --> 1:21:53.600
I’ll cut you some more.
- Are you?

1:21:53.700 --> 1:21:55.700
Yeah, I’ll cut you.

1:22:08.234 --> 1:22:10.834
Cut me.
Cut me.

1:22:10.834 --> 1:22:14.234
'I loved her.'

1:22:14.234 --> 1:22:16.667
One little-known...

1:22:16.667 --> 1:22:18.734
'And I thought she loved me.'

1:22:18.834 --> 1:22:21.300
...esoteric procession of the number 23.

1:22:21.400 --> 1:22:23.834
Does a thing itself have a mystical power?

1:22:23.934 --> 1:22:25.758
Does that equate?
- Yes, that-- that's--...

1:22:25.858 --> 1:22:26.433
that's the...

1:22:26.533 --> 1:22:29.608
'Until my father's number...

1:22:29.658 --> 1:22:31.658
returned to haunt me.'

1:22:44.067 --> 1:22:46.134
Are you insane?

1:22:46.134 --> 1:22:48.984
'That fucking number.'

1:23:10.134 --> 1:23:13.659
'When I circled every
23rd letter of her note...

1:23:14.934 --> 1:23:17.767
it became clear.'

1:23:19.334 --> 1:23:21.700
'The number had gone after me.

1:23:25.334 --> 1:23:28.709
And now it wanted her.'

1:23:31.700 --> 1:23:33.767
Laura, this room-- you gotta get out.

1:23:33.867 --> 1:23:35.485
It's coming for you.
I can't stop it.

1:23:35.585 --> 1:23:35.767
What?

1:23:35.867 --> 1:23:38.800
What?
- The number.

1:23:40.167 --> 1:23:43.634
No no no no no.
- Leave me alone.

1:23:46.234 --> 1:23:48.801
You think you have the guts to use it?

1:23:48.901 --> 1:23:51.901
Go ahead.

1:23:51.901 --> 1:23:54.567
Kill me.

1:23:58.234 --> 1:24:00.234
I love you.

1:24:02.500 --> 1:24:05.901
I never loved you,
ever.

1:24:05.901 --> 1:24:09.500
How could I?

1:24:09.500 --> 1:24:11.834
How could anyone?

1:24:11.834 --> 1:24:13.834
You're pathetic.

1:24:15.234 --> 1:24:17.368
Just like your father.

1:24:19.700 --> 1:24:21.700
Get out!

1:24:31.301 --> 1:24:33.168
Laura.

1:24:33.268 --> 1:24:35.901
Laura!

1:24:35.901 --> 1:24:38.400
Laura!
Laura!

1:24:38.400 --> 1:24:39.967
Laura!

1:24:40.067 --> 1:24:43.533
Laura! Laura!

1:24:43.533 --> 1:24:46.500
Laura!
Laura!

1:24:46.500 --> 1:24:49.934
Laura! Laura!

1:24:49.934 --> 1:24:53.067
Laura!

1:24:54.500 --> 1:24:56.500
I was right.

1:24:56.600 --> 1:24:58.834
She was in danger.

1:24:58.834 --> 1:25:01.909
I just didn't realize the danger was me.'

1:25:04.334 --> 1:25:06.967
It's gonna be all right.

1:25:09.934 --> 1:25:13.101
I just didn't realize the danger was me.'

1:25:29.433 --> 1:25:31.901
Hey, Laura.

1:25:36.533 --> 1:25:38.533
Laura?

1:26:16.400 --> 1:26:19.101
'What began as a suicide note...

1:26:19.201 --> 1:26:20.667
turned into something more...'

1:26:30.268 --> 1:26:32.268
Shh-- get the--...

1:26:33.634 --> 1:26:36.467
'...much, much more.'

1:26:38.301 --> 1:26:40.301
23.
That's a good one.

1:26:40.301 --> 1:26:42.334
That's a good one.

1:26:49.901 --> 1:26:52.667
23.23.

1:26:52.667 --> 1:26:53.901
23.

1:26:54.001 --> 1:26:57.001
23, 23.
Fuck it, fuck it.

1:26:57.001 --> 1:26:58.268
I can see it.
It's everywhere.

1:26:58.368 --> 1:27:01.700
It's everywhere.
It's everywhere.

1:27:01.700 --> 1:27:03.800
No more fun and games.

1:27:05.034 --> 1:27:07.301
Laura.

1:27:18.467 --> 1:27:21.400
Shit!
This fucking...

1:27:21.400 --> 1:27:23.433
It's not true.

1:27:23.433 --> 1:27:25.467
It's not true.

1:27:25.467 --> 1:27:28.368
He does not-- does not--

1:27:32.600 --> 1:27:34.667
I love you...

1:27:34.667 --> 1:27:36.168
More than any of...

1:27:36.268 --> 1:27:39.001
Period, exclamation.

1:28:09.400 --> 1:28:11.433
Remember this?

1:28:37.901 --> 1:28:39.476
'They thought it was...

1:28:39.576 --> 1:28:40.067
the fall...'

1:28:40.167 --> 1:28:42.666
He doesn't remember anything.
It's not uncommon in cases...

1:28:42.766 --> 1:28:43.967
of such severe head injury.

1:28:44.067 --> 1:28:46.551
He could recover his memory tomorrow...

1:28:46.651 --> 1:28:47.234
or never.

1:28:47.334 --> 1:28:49.367
Well, of course you
have to factor in the history...

1:28:49.467 --> 1:28:51.934
of mental instability of the patient's family.

1:28:52.034 --> 1:28:53.934
His own father attempted suicide.

1:28:54.034 --> 1:28:56.250
He just managed to be a little more...

1:28:56.350 --> 1:28:57.400
successful at it.

1:28:57.500 --> 1:28:59.878
'...because the trauma of Laura...

1:28:59.978 --> 1:29:01.168
appeared to be fiction.'

1:29:01.268 --> 1:29:04.067
And all that scribbling?
- Severe graphomania.

1:29:04.167 --> 1:29:06.067
The rantings of a delirious mind.

1:29:06.167 --> 1:29:08.067
Some sort of a survivor's guilt mixed up...

1:29:08.167 --> 1:29:09.667
with a numerology obsession.

1:29:09.767 --> 1:29:12.867
You have your hands full, doctor.

1:29:12.867 --> 1:29:15.500
Mmm.
I’ll do what I can.

1:29:16.634 --> 1:29:19.667
Say, uh, may I have this book?

1:29:19.667 --> 1:29:22.134
Thank you.

1:29:22.134 --> 1:29:24.268
'My novel,

1:29:24.268 --> 1:29:26.134
my confession,

1:29:26.234 --> 1:29:30.134
I never saw it again.'
- My name is Dr. Nathaniel.

1:29:30.134 --> 1:29:33.167
'Some injuries can be healed over time.

1:29:33.167 --> 1:29:36.567
Some are just too hard to deal with.

1:29:36.567 --> 1:29:38.067
So my brain just blocked out...

1:29:38.167 --> 1:29:40.800
the terrible thing I had done...

1:29:40.800 --> 1:29:42.800
and the reasons why.'

1:29:44.034 --> 1:29:45.284
Take care.
- I hope I never...

1:29:45.384 --> 1:29:46.034
see you again.

1:29:46.134 --> 1:29:49.584
I hope not. I hope not.
Don't come back, fella.

1:29:49.634 --> 1:29:51.634
Okay.

1:29:58.368 --> 1:30:00.937
Ooh! Oh my god.
I’m so sorry.

1:30:01.037 --> 1:30:01.168
Oh!

1:30:01.268 --> 1:30:02.734
Oh, no.

1:30:02.834 --> 1:30:04.360
'Agatha knew nothing...

1:30:04.460 --> 1:30:05.067
about my past.'

1:30:05.167 --> 1:30:06.867
Oh, you owe me a cake.

1:30:06.967 --> 1:30:09.333
'That made two of us.

1:30:09.433 --> 1:30:11.934
I was free for now,

1:30:11.934 --> 1:30:14.500
But the number found a new victim.

1:30:14.500 --> 1:30:17.500
The number left me alone for 13 years...

1:30:19.034 --> 1:30:22.967
until the night she found my book,

1:30:22.967 --> 1:30:25.101
or the book found her.'

1:30:49.167 --> 1:30:51.168
This is where I wrote it all.

1:30:51.268 --> 1:30:54.500
It was me.

1:30:54.500 --> 1:30:56.834
I’m a murderer.

1:31:01.433 --> 1:31:03.983
I don't know what happened to you,

1:31:04.033 --> 1:31:06.033
but I do know this:

1:31:06.634 --> 1:31:09.634
You weren't a bad person who got better;

1:31:10.800 --> 1:31:13.300
You were a sick person who became well.

1:31:13.400 --> 1:31:16.567
I killed Laura Tollins.

1:31:19.433 --> 1:31:22.958
There's an innocent man
in prison because of me.

1:31:23.867 --> 1:31:26.368
You're a wonderful husband,

1:31:26.368 --> 1:31:30.368
and you're the best father
a son could ever have.

1:31:30.368 --> 1:31:33.068
And what would Robin do without you?

1:31:34.500 --> 1:31:36.744
You know I can't let an innocent man...

1:31:36.844 --> 1:31:37.500
go on suffering...

1:31:37.600 --> 1:31:41.500
for my horrible sin.

1:31:41.500 --> 1:31:44.101
We're all broken, Walter.

1:31:44.101 --> 1:31:46.001
Remember, you told me your life started...

1:31:46.101 --> 1:31:48.101
when you met me?

1:31:48.101 --> 1:31:50.734
Well, my life...

1:31:50.734 --> 1:31:52.836
began that day, too.
- You didn't know...

1:31:52.936 --> 1:31:53.467
who I was.

1:31:53.567 --> 1:31:56.101
I didn't know who I was.

1:31:56.101 --> 1:31:58.450
I want you to leave, Ag.

1:31:58.550 --> 1:31:58.700
No.

1:31:58.800 --> 1:32:00.971
You need to leave before...

1:32:01.071 --> 1:32:01.168
No.

1:32:01.268 --> 1:32:03.767
Before what?

1:32:08.034 --> 1:32:10.034
Before you kill me?

1:32:12.467 --> 1:32:14.967
Damn it, Walter.

1:32:14.967 --> 1:32:17.134
Look, this...

1:32:17.134 --> 1:32:19.134
This is who you were.

1:32:19.134 --> 1:32:21.334
This is not who you are.

1:32:23.034 --> 1:32:24.784
This is not who you are!

1:32:24.884 --> 1:32:26.884
I’m a killer!

1:32:27.001 --> 1:32:30.268
I have killed someone.

1:32:30.268 --> 1:32:33.034
I killed someone.

1:32:33.034 --> 1:32:35.034
I could do it again.

1:32:35.034 --> 1:32:37.808
You think you could do it again? You think...

1:32:37.908 --> 1:32:38.934
you're a killer?

1:32:39.034 --> 1:32:40.300
Here, then take this.

1:32:40.400 --> 1:32:42.400
You go ahead and do it.

1:32:42.400 --> 1:32:44.367
If you're a killer,
then kill me!

1:32:44.467 --> 1:32:45.967
Look around at all the beautiful 23s.

1:32:46.067 --> 1:32:48.007
You don't want to disappoint them,

1:32:48.107 --> 1:32:48.467
do you?

1:32:48.567 --> 1:32:50.367
Do it!

1:32:52.967 --> 1:32:54.834
I love you.

1:32:54.934 --> 1:32:57.967
No, don't you say that.

1:32:59.567 --> 1:33:02.567
I love you.
- No, you can't!

1:33:06.700 --> 1:33:08.767
Nobody can.

1:33:46.467 --> 1:33:48.533
Dad!

1:33:58.034 --> 1:34:00.604
There's no such thing...

1:34:00.704 --> 1:34:01.433
as destiny.

1:34:01.533 --> 1:34:04.008
There are only different choices.

1:34:21.433 --> 1:34:23.967
It's just a number.

1:34:23.967 --> 1:34:27.001
Some choices are easy;

1:34:27.001 --> 1:34:28.801
Some aren't.

1:34:28.901 --> 1:34:31.800
Those are the really important ones,

1:34:31.800 --> 1:34:35.134
the ones that define us as people.

1:34:35.134 --> 1:34:38.101
The lord is my shepherd.
there is nothing I lack.

1:34:38.201 --> 1:34:40.834
In green pastures,
you let me graze.

1:34:40.834 --> 1:34:44.500
To safe waters, you lead me.
You restore my...

1:34:44.500 --> 1:34:45.651
13 years ago I made...

1:34:45.751 --> 1:34:46.901
the wrong choice...

1:34:47.001 --> 1:34:49.201
Guide me along the right path for the sake...

1:34:49.301 --> 1:34:52.500
I needed to put it right,

1:34:52.500 --> 1:34:54.567
and not just for my sake.

1:35:11.001 --> 1:35:14.867
To die there in the street
would have been easy,

1:35:14.867 --> 1:35:17.834
but it wouldn't have been justice,

1:35:17.834 --> 1:35:21.959
at least not the justice
fathers teach their sons about.

1:35:29.934 --> 1:35:32.634
I’ll be sentenced in a week or so.

1:35:32.634 --> 1:35:34.142
My lawyer says the judge will look...

1:35:34.242 --> 1:35:34.834
kindly upon me...

1:35:34.934 --> 1:35:37.400
for turning myself in.

1:35:37.400 --> 1:35:40.001
Maybe it's not the happiest of endings,

1:35:40.101 --> 1:35:42.567
but it's the right one.

1:35:44.234 --> 1:35:46.268
Someday I’ll be up for parole...

1:35:46.368 --> 1:35:48.268
and we can go on living our lives.

1:35:48.368 --> 1:35:51.134
It's only a matter of time.

1:35:51.134 --> 1:35:53.034
Of course, time's just a counting system--...

1:35:53.134 --> 1:35:55.301
numbers...

1:35:55.301 --> 1:35:57.551
with meaning attached to them.

1:36:00.700 --> 1:36:03.400
Isn't it?

1:36:04.700 --> 1:37:00.400
