01:57.964 --> 02:00.392
Hey. Pull up at the corner.

02:13.480 --> 02:15.113
Wait here.

02:22.155 --> 02:23.539
How.

02:23.698 --> 02:25.830
Good afternoon, sir.

02:57.357 --> 02:58.776
Yes?

02:59.151 --> 03:02.778
I'd like to see the boss.
What'd you say his name is?

03:02.779 --> 03:05.491
- I didn't say.
- Cagey, huh?

03:06.366 --> 03:08.033
Mr Boot is the owner and publisher.

03:08.034 --> 03:11.370
Okay. Tell Mr Boot Mr Tatum
would like to see him.

03:11.371 --> 03:13.873
Charles Tatum from New York.

03:13.874 --> 03:15.553
What about?

03:16.168 --> 03:17.501
Look, fan, just ask him,

03:17.502 --> 03:20.843
how would he like to make
himself a fast $200 a week?

03:21.339 --> 03:23.716
What did you say you
were selling? Insurance?

03:23.717 --> 03:25.480
I didn't say.

03:25.927 --> 03:27.642
Cagey, huh?

03:52.621 --> 03:55.289
Now, isn't that something?
Who said it?

03:55.290 --> 03:58.429
Well, Mr Boot said it,
but I did the needlework.

03:58.585 --> 03:59.752
Oh!

03:59.753 --> 04:02.963
- Okay.
- I wish I could coin them like that.

04:02.964 --> 04:05.226
If I ever do, would you
embroider it for me?

04:10.972 --> 04:12.431
- Mr Tatum?
- Yes, sir.

04:12.432 --> 04:13.808
Go ahead. What is it?

04:13.809 --> 04:16.310
Well, Mr Boot, I was passing
through Albuquerque.

04:16.310 --> 04:19.188
Had breakfast here.
Read your paper.

04:19.189 --> 04:20.898
Thought you might be
interested in my reaction.

04:20.899 --> 04:24.370
- You bet I am.
- Well, sir, it made me throw up.

04:25.028 --> 04:27.905
I don't want you to think I
expected <i>The New York Times.</i>

04:27.906 --> 04:30.908
But even for Albuquerque,
this is pretty Albuquerque.

04:30.909 --> 04:32.743
All right. Here's your nickel back.

04:32.744 --> 04:35.704
Now, what's all this about
my making $200 a week?

04:35.705 --> 04:37.415
Apparently, you're not
familiar with my name.

04:37.416 --> 04:38.666
Can't say that I am.

04:38.667 --> 04:40.835
That's because you don't get
the eastern papers out here.

04:40.836 --> 04:42.002
I thought maybe once in a while

04:42.003 --> 04:43.712
somebody would toss one
out of the <i>Super Chief</i>

04:43.713 --> 04:45.673
and you might've seen my byline.

04:45.674 --> 04:49.635
Charles Tatum? Worked New
York, Chicago, Detroit...

04:49.636 --> 04:52.894
- What about the $200?
- I was coming to that.

04:54.266 --> 04:57.322
Mr Boot, I'm a $250-a-week
newspaperman.

04:57.727 --> 05:00.604
- I can be had for $50.
- Why are you so good to me?

05:00.605 --> 05:03.107
I know newspapers backward,
forward and sideways.

05:03.108 --> 05:05.693
I can write them, edit them, print
them, wrap them and sell them.

05:05.694 --> 05:08.988
- Don't need anybody right now.
- I can handle big news and little news.

05:08.989 --> 05:12.662
And if there's no news,
I'll go out and bite a dog.

05:14.077 --> 05:17.466
- Make it $45.
- What makes you so cheap?

05:18.582 --> 05:22.585
A fair question, considering I've
been top man wherever I've worked.

05:22.586 --> 05:24.879
You'll be glad to know that
I've been fired from 11 papers

05:24.880 --> 05:27.590
with a total circulation
of seven million,

05:27.591 --> 05:30.176
for reasons with which I
don't want to bore you.

05:30.177 --> 05:32.224
Go ahead. Bore me.

05:36.057 --> 05:39.894
I'm a pretty good liar. I've
done a lot of lying in my time.

05:39.895 --> 05:42.897
I've lied to men who wear belts. I've
lied to men who wear suspenders.

05:42.898 --> 05:44.690
But I'd never be so
stupid as to lie to a man

05:44.691 --> 05:47.401
who wears both belt and suspenders.

05:47.402 --> 05:50.988
- How's that again?
- You strike me as a cautious man.

05:50.989 --> 05:53.699
A man who checks and double-checks.

05:53.700 --> 05:55.951
So I'll tell you why I was fired.

05:55.952 --> 05:58.496
In New York, a story of mine
brought on a libel suit.

05:58.497 --> 06:02.458
In Chicago, I started something
with the publisher's wife.

06:02.459 --> 06:04.710
In Detroit, I was caught
drinking out of season.

06:04.711 --> 06:07.553
- In Cleveland...
- I get the picture.

06:07.756 --> 06:11.300
Now, then I find myself in
Albuquerque with no money.

06:11.301 --> 06:15.188
A burnt-out bearing, bad tyres
and a lousy reputation.

06:15.305 --> 06:17.014
Bad tyres can be dangerous.

06:17.015 --> 06:19.266
I've only one chance to
get back where I belong.

06:19.267 --> 06:21.811
To land a job on a
small-town paper like yours

06:21.812 --> 06:25.022
and wait and hope and pray
for something big to break,

06:25.023 --> 06:27.066
something I can latch on to,

06:27.067 --> 06:30.528
something the wire services will
gobble up and yell for more.

06:30.529 --> 06:35.459
Just one good beat, a Tatum special,
and they'll roll out the red carpet.

06:35.867 --> 06:39.620
Because when they need you,
they forgive and forget.

06:39.621 --> 06:40.746
But until then, Mr Boot,

06:40.747 --> 06:44.670
you'll get yourself the best
newspaperman you ever had.

06:44.709 --> 06:47.931
- At $40 per. When do I start?
- Don't push.

06:49.131 --> 06:52.133
- I hope I haven't scared you off.
- Well, I don't know.

06:52.134 --> 06:55.219
I'm not afraid of a libel suit,
because I'm a lawyer myself.

06:55.220 --> 06:57.304
Check and double-check
every word I print.

06:57.305 --> 06:58.973
Sure. Belt and suspenders.

06:58.974 --> 07:00.558
Now, about that publisher's wife,

07:00.559 --> 07:03.394
I think you should know Mrs Boot
is a grandmother three times.

07:03.395 --> 07:06.272
If you wanna start something with
her, she'd be very flattered.

07:06.273 --> 07:08.649
And as for drinking,
do you drink a lot?

07:08.650 --> 07:10.484
Not a lot. Just frequently.

07:10.485 --> 07:13.821
We have a shop rule here,
no liquor on the premises.

07:13.822 --> 07:16.073
- How about smoking?
- Of course.

07:16.074 --> 07:19.048
And I pay $60 a week in this shop.

07:19.995 --> 07:21.758
I'll take it.

07:24.666 --> 07:25.916
Where's my desk?

07:25.917 --> 07:29.887
The one by the door. You may
be out of here by Saturday.

07:30.797 --> 07:33.011
The sooner the better.

07:59.785 --> 08:03.505
Thanks, Geronimo. Take these
over to the engraver's.

08:04.039 --> 08:05.539
What's this mess?

08:05.540 --> 08:07.124
They haven't got any
chopped chicken livers.

08:07.125 --> 08:08.626
I brought you some chicken tacos.

08:08.627 --> 08:10.002
Chicken tacos?

08:10.003 --> 08:11.796
They're not gonna chop the
livers any more for you.

08:11.797 --> 08:15.636
Nobody else will buy them.
And no more garlic pickles.

08:18.637 --> 08:21.472
When the history of this
sun-baked Siberia is written,

08:21.473 --> 08:24.308
these shameful words
will live in infamy.

08:24.309 --> 08:26.772
"No chopped chicken liver."

08:28.772 --> 08:30.868
"No garlic pickles."

08:31.858 --> 08:35.532
No Lindy's. No Madison
Square Garden.

08:35.695 --> 08:37.542
No Yogi Berra.

08:38.740 --> 08:41.241
What do you know about
Yogi Berra, Miss Deverich?

08:41.243 --> 08:43.577
- I beg your pardon?
- Yogi Berra!

08:43.578 --> 08:46.747
Yogi? Why, it's a sort
of religion, isn't it?

08:46.748 --> 08:50.635
You bet it is. A belief
in the New York Yankees.

08:51.711 --> 08:54.380
You know what's wrong with
New Mexico, Mr Wendel?

08:54.381 --> 08:56.428
Too much outdoors.

08:57.217 --> 09:01.804
Give me those eight spindly trees in
front of Rockefeller Center any day.

09:01.805 --> 09:04.398
That's enough outdoors for me.

09:04.766 --> 09:08.356
No subways smelling sweet-sour.

09:09.646 --> 09:12.690
What do you use for
noise around here?

09:12.691 --> 09:15.276
No beautiful roar from
eight million ants,

09:15.277 --> 09:17.657
fighting, cursing, loving.

09:18.739 --> 09:21.664
No shows. No <i>South Pacific.</i>

09:22.492 --> 09:26.296
No chic little dames
across a crowded bar.

09:27.998 --> 09:29.248
And worst of all, Herbie,

09:29.249 --> 09:32.803
no 80th floor to jump from
when you feel like it.

09:33.253 --> 09:35.713
Is this one of your
long-playing records, Chuck?

09:35.714 --> 09:38.094
Let's hear the other side.

09:38.759 --> 09:41.470
All right. I'll play it for you.

09:41.762 --> 09:46.599
When I came here, I thought this was
gonna be a 30-day stretch, maybe 60.

09:46.600 --> 09:48.517
Now it's a year.

09:48.518 --> 09:50.686
It looks like a life sentence.

09:50.687 --> 09:54.482
Where is it? Where's the loaf
of bread with a file in it?

09:54.483 --> 09:57.823
Where's that big story
to get me out of here?

09:58.695 --> 10:01.489
One year, and what's our hot news?

10:01.490 --> 10:03.454
A soapbox derby.

10:04.493 --> 10:08.213
A tornado that double-crossed
us and went to Texas.

10:08.789 --> 10:12.208
An old goof who said he
was the real Jesse James,

10:12.209 --> 10:14.460
until they found out he was
a chicken thief from Gallup

10:14.461 --> 10:17.256
by the name of Schimmelmacher.

10:18.673 --> 10:22.596
I'm stuck here, fans.
Stuck for good!

10:24.679 --> 10:26.222
Unless, of course,
you, Miss Deverich,

10:26.223 --> 10:28.307
Unless, of course,
you, Miss Deverich,

10:28.308 --> 10:30.267
instead of writing household hints

10:30.268 --> 10:33.270
about how to remove chilli
stains from blue jeans,

10:33.271 --> 10:36.446
get yourself involved
in a trunk murder.

10:36.691 --> 10:38.943
How about it, Miss Deverich?

10:38.944 --> 10:42.332
I could do wonders with
your dismembered body.

10:42.614 --> 10:45.290
Oh, Mr Tatum. Really.

10:48.370 --> 10:50.501
Or you, Mr Wendel.

10:51.039 --> 10:53.874
If you'd only toss that
cigar out of the window,

10:53.875 --> 10:58.671
real far, all the
way to Los Alamos,

10:58.672 --> 11:00.304
and boom!

11:02.259 --> 11:04.721
Now there would be a story.

11:05.720 --> 11:10.141
I told you no liquor in the office.
I thought I could trust you.

11:10.142 --> 11:13.400
What a suspicious nature
you have, Mr Boot.

11:16.481 --> 11:18.399
Pretty, isn't it?
I make those things

11:18.400 --> 11:21.026
every night when I go home out
of matches and toothpicks.

11:21.027 --> 11:22.956
Calms my nerves.

11:23.029 --> 11:25.576
Sorry, Tatum.

11:26.241 --> 11:28.826
- Maybe you do need a change.
- Do I.

11:28.827 --> 11:32.955
And I got news for you. You're going
out of town for a couple of days.

11:32.956 --> 11:35.875
- How far and in what direction?
- Los Barrios county.

11:35.876 --> 11:38.586
They're having a rattlesnake hunt,
and I want you to cover it.

11:38.587 --> 11:40.629
- A rattlesnake hunt?
- That's right.

11:40.630 --> 11:43.716
And take Herbie along.
Let's get some art.

11:43.717 --> 11:47.428
A rattlesnake hunt. Well,
isn't that ginger-peachy?

11:47.429 --> 11:50.014
A real "stop the press,
pull out the front page",

11:50.015 --> 11:51.599
"get ready to re-plate" assignment.

11:51.600 --> 11:53.726
Have a nice time, Chuck.
See the country.

11:53.727 --> 11:56.949
And don't worry, I'll
put the paper to bed.

11:59.107 --> 12:03.789
Well, it looks like we're starting
our second year with a real bang.

12:03.987 --> 12:06.083
Okay, fan, pack up.

12:15.791 --> 12:17.833
You know, this could be a
pretty good story, Chuck.

12:17.834 --> 12:19.794
Don't sell it short.

12:19.795 --> 12:21.962
It's quite a sight, 1,000
rattlers in the underbrush,

12:21.963 --> 12:24.757
and a lot of men smoking them
out, bashing in their heads.

12:24.758 --> 12:28.229
Big deal, 1,000 rattlers
in the underbrush.

12:31.098 --> 12:34.438
Give me just 50 of them
loose in Albuquerque.

12:35.102 --> 12:37.686
Like that leopard in Oklahoma City.

12:37.687 --> 12:39.980
The whole town in panic.

12:39.981 --> 12:42.990
Deserted streets.
Barricaded houses.

12:43.443 --> 12:45.945
They're evacuating the children.

12:45.946 --> 12:48.041
Every man is armed.

12:48.573 --> 12:51.369
Fifty killers on the prowl. Fifty.

12:52.077 --> 12:55.216
One by one, they start
hunting them down.

12:55.372 --> 12:57.301
They get 10, 20.

12:57.624 --> 13:00.882
It's building. They get
40, 45. They get 49.

13:01.044 --> 13:03.424
Where's the last rattler?

13:03.755 --> 13:08.426
In a kindergarten? In a church?
In a crowded elevator? Where?

13:08.427 --> 13:10.439
I give up. Where?

13:11.012 --> 13:13.523
In my desk drawer, fan.

13:14.808 --> 13:17.017
Stashed away, only
nobody knows it, see?

13:17.018 --> 13:19.103
The story's good for
another three days.

13:19.104 --> 13:22.148
Then when I'm good and ready,
we come out with a big extra.

13:22.149 --> 13:24.778
<i>"Sun-Bulletin</i> snags number 50."

13:24.985 --> 13:27.531
Where do you get those ideas?

13:27.779 --> 13:32.496
Herbie, boy, how long did you go
to that school of journalism?

13:32.576 --> 13:34.339
Three years.

13:34.578 --> 13:37.005
Three years down the drain.

13:38.331 --> 13:41.625
Me, I didn't go to any college, but
I know what makes a good story.

13:41.626 --> 13:43.210
Because before I ever
worked on a paper,

13:43.211 --> 13:45.296
I sold them on a street corner.

13:45.297 --> 13:49.646
You know the first thing I found out?
Bad news sells best.

13:50.969 --> 13:53.562
Because good news is no news.

13:54.514 --> 13:56.645
Better get some gas.

14:17.162 --> 14:19.174
Hey! Anybody here?

14:22.125 --> 14:23.509
Hey!

14:35.388 --> 14:36.938
Service!

14:43.647 --> 14:45.445
Anybody home?

14:58.286 --> 15:00.667
Sorry to bother you, lady.

15:04.334 --> 15:06.714
I'd like to buy some gas.

15:25.230 --> 15:28.232
Hey, there's something
screwy about this place.

15:28.233 --> 15:30.245
There's just an old
lady in there that's...

15:41.246 --> 15:44.123
Now, what would the law be doing up
there in that old Indian cliff dwelling?

15:44.124 --> 15:47.376
Maybe they got a warrant for
Sitting Bull for that Custer rap.

15:47.377 --> 15:50.045
Come on, Herbie, let's go
visiting. It's for free.

15:50.046 --> 15:52.173
I can get the gas on the way back.

15:52.174 --> 15:54.008
That is, if she's stopped praying.

15:54.009 --> 15:56.051
- Who?
- That old lady in there.

15:56.052 --> 15:57.762
What's she praying for?

15:57.763 --> 16:02.349
I don't know, but whatever she's
praying for she's sure praying hard.

16:02.350 --> 16:05.146
Maybe it ties in. Let's see.

16:21.995 --> 16:23.954
Oh, I thought you were the doctor.

16:23.955 --> 16:25.414
What's the matter? Somebody hurt?

16:25.415 --> 16:28.667
We don't know yet. He's way in
there, under that mountain.

16:28.668 --> 16:31.170
- What happened?
- We had a cave-in this morning.

16:31.171 --> 16:32.880
Oh. That so?

16:32.881 --> 16:35.007
Dumb cluck. Everybody
keeps telling him,

16:35.008 --> 16:37.134
"Stay out of that place.
Stay out of there."

16:37.135 --> 16:39.011
Not Leo. Stubborn like a mule.

16:39.012 --> 16:41.847
He always keeps going back,
digging for those Indian pots.

16:41.848 --> 16:44.192
- Who's Leo?
- My husband.

16:45.727 --> 16:47.027
Oh.

16:47.104 --> 16:50.658
Well, I'm sorry to hear
about it. Hop in.

17:02.661 --> 17:05.171
- You live around here?
- Yeah.

17:05.372 --> 17:06.872
I'm Mrs Leo Minosa.

17:06.873 --> 17:09.791
We own that trading post
down on the highway.

17:09.792 --> 17:12.588
Finest store in downtown Escudero.

17:12.753 --> 17:15.798
Is that what they call
this place? Escudero?

17:15.799 --> 17:18.342
Got a couple of other
names for it myself.

17:18.343 --> 17:22.137
Did the Indians really live
in that place 450 years ago?

17:22.138 --> 17:25.015
I wouldn't know. I haven't
been around that long.

17:25.016 --> 17:27.147
Only seems that long.

17:27.560 --> 17:30.354
Say, if you gents stopped by to see
that broken-down cliff dwelling,

17:30.355 --> 17:32.815
you sure picked a swell day.

17:32.816 --> 17:34.734
All right, let's have the facts.
You're his father?

17:34.735 --> 17:36.694
Yes. I'm his father.

17:36.695 --> 17:40.700
- How long has he been inside?
- Pretty near six hours now.

17:40.949 --> 17:42.742
How far down you think he is?

17:42.743 --> 17:46.746
Oh, about 250 or 300
foot, I should judge.

17:46.747 --> 17:49.582
Best we could do was to
get in about halfway.

17:49.583 --> 17:53.461
You got to watch yourself. Swing that
pick too hard in them old walls,

17:53.462 --> 17:56.380
you start a sand slide and
block up the whole place.

17:56.381 --> 17:58.429
Then goodbye, Leo.

18:03.680 --> 18:05.264
Is that coffee good
and hot, Lorraine?

18:05.265 --> 18:08.058
Sure, it's hot. The sandwiches are
in the blanket. So are the cigars.

18:08.059 --> 18:10.394
- How's Mama?
- All right, I guess.

18:10.395 --> 18:13.731
- How do I find my way?
- Just follow our rope. We left it in there.

18:13.732 --> 18:16.609
After that, holler.
He'll yell back.

18:16.610 --> 18:18.705
Wait a minute, you.

18:19.154 --> 18:21.238
Nobody goes no place
here without I say so.

18:21.239 --> 18:24.325
He's cold. He's hungry. We've got to
let him know we're doing something.

18:24.326 --> 18:27.203
Look, I got my hands full already
without having two of you in there.

18:27.204 --> 18:30.331
- Somebody's got to go.
- How about those Indians?

18:30.332 --> 18:33.918
What do you say, chief? You ought to
know your way around here pretty well.

18:33.919 --> 18:36.337
They won't go in. They never do.

18:36.338 --> 18:38.464
- Bad spirits.
- Ah, go on.

18:38.465 --> 18:40.762
What are you holding out
for, a couple of bucks?

18:42.677 --> 18:44.178
He says it's their holy mountain.
The mountain of the seven vultures.

18:44.179 --> 18:46.680
He says it's their holy mountain.
The mountain of the seven vultures.

18:46.681 --> 18:51.114
The mountain of the seven
vultures. It's got a sound to it.

18:52.479 --> 18:54.906
Get me a few shots, Herbie.

18:59.736 --> 19:02.571
Looks like it's your move, copper.
What's it gonna be?

19:02.572 --> 19:04.657
I'm thinking. Don't rush me.
I'll do something.

19:04.658 --> 19:09.745
You could always give that poor fellow
in there a ticket for parking overtime.

19:09.746 --> 19:11.038
Let me have those things.

19:11.039 --> 19:12.331
Who do you think you are
butting in like this?

19:12.332 --> 19:13.999
- Let me have your flashlight.
- Who is he?

19:14.000 --> 19:16.627
I'll tell you who I am. I'm the
guy who's going in that cave.

19:16.628 --> 19:18.546
And you're the guy that's been
sounding off long enough.

19:18.547 --> 19:19.755
Now give me your flashlight.

19:19.756 --> 19:21.934
- Why, you...
- Shut up.

19:22.175 --> 19:24.104
Come on, Herbie.

19:25.929 --> 19:27.513
Thanks, mister, and God bless you.

19:27.514 --> 19:29.598
Tell him we'll get him out.
Tell him not to worry.

19:29.599 --> 19:30.766
- Sure.
- Okay.

19:30.767 --> 19:32.977
And tell him we'll have a big
coming-out party for him

19:32.978 --> 19:35.738
with a brass band and everything.

20:05.469 --> 20:07.397
Here's the rope.

20:07.512 --> 20:09.856
I hope we can get to him.

20:09.931 --> 20:11.350
Yeah.

20:17.439 --> 20:19.819
Watch out for those rocks.

20:27.699 --> 20:29.867
The old man sure looked bad.

20:29.868 --> 20:32.379
- Did you see his face?
- Yeah.

20:33.121 --> 20:36.540
Like the faces of those folks
you see outside a coal mine

20:36.541 --> 20:39.337
with maybe 84 men trapped inside.

20:39.419 --> 20:43.223
One man's better than 84.
Didn't they teach you that?

20:43.507 --> 20:46.183
- Teach me what?
- Human interest.

20:46.551 --> 20:51.013
You pick up the paper,
you read about 84 men or 284,

20:51.014 --> 20:53.265
or a million men, like
in the Chinese famine.

20:53.266 --> 20:56.018
You read it, but it
doesn't stay with you.

20:56.019 --> 21:00.147
One man's different. You wanna know
all about him. That's human interest.

21:00.148 --> 21:04.276
Somebody all by himself, like
Lindbergh crossing the Atlantic

21:04.277 --> 21:06.290
or Floyd Collins.

21:06.530 --> 21:08.697
Floyd Collins.
Doesn't that ring a bell?

21:08.698 --> 21:11.126
No, not to me, it doesn't.

21:11.243 --> 21:13.077
You never heard of Floyd Collins?

21:13.078 --> 21:15.287
1925. Kentucky.

21:15.288 --> 21:17.253
The guy pinned way
down in that cave.

21:17.457 --> 21:19.333
One of the biggest
stories that ever broke.

21:19.334 --> 21:23.007
Front page in every paper
in the country for weeks.

21:23.255 --> 21:26.560
Say, what'd you take at that
school of journalism, advertising?

21:26.842 --> 21:29.260
Well, maybe I did hear about it.

21:29.261 --> 21:31.679
Then maybe you heard that a
reporter on a Louisville paper

21:31.680 --> 21:35.851
crawled in for the story and
came out with a Pulitzer Prize.

21:52.033 --> 21:55.494
Guess we'd better not
fool around with that.

21:55.495 --> 21:57.460
Here. Hold this.

22:08.300 --> 22:10.347
Now let me have it.

22:11.762 --> 22:13.394
And camera.

22:15.098 --> 22:17.525
You got a couple of bulbs?

22:21.646 --> 22:23.493
You stay here.

22:23.523 --> 22:27.026
That sand gets any worse,
let me hear from you, but loud.

22:27.027 --> 22:29.361
I don't like the
looks of it, Chuck.

22:29.362 --> 22:31.458
I don't either, fan.

22:32.991 --> 22:35.122
But I like the odds.

23:00.268 --> 23:01.771
Hello!

23:03.021 --> 23:04.606
Hello!

23:04.815 --> 23:06.281
Here!

23:20.122 --> 23:21.706
Over here.

23:25.460 --> 23:26.927
Here.

23:29.005 --> 23:30.720
Over here.

23:47.190 --> 23:49.692
Hello, Leo. How do you feel?

23:49.693 --> 23:51.235
Not so bad any more.

23:51.236 --> 23:53.571
I thought nobody would ever come.

23:53.572 --> 23:56.367
Anything hurt? Any bones broken?

23:57.075 --> 23:59.039
No, I guess not.

23:59.161 --> 24:00.911
Can't you get your
legs out from under?

24:00.912 --> 24:03.789
What do you think I've
been trying to do?

24:03.790 --> 24:05.499
They're pinned under me.

24:05.500 --> 24:07.596
Maybe I can help.

24:09.671 --> 24:11.802
Hey, watch it! Watch it!

24:13.508 --> 24:15.634
You want those rocks to
come down on my head?

24:15.635 --> 24:17.845
I didn't know they were that shaky.

24:17.846 --> 24:20.190
They're all pretty shaky.

24:20.348 --> 24:23.225
It's an old place been coming
apart for a long time.

24:23.226 --> 24:25.478
Looks like we'll have to
take them out one by one.

24:25.479 --> 24:29.482
Don't try it by yourself.
It's gonna take a lot of figuring.

24:29.483 --> 24:32.777
The way they are now, if one goes,
they'll all go, roof and everything.

24:32.778 --> 24:35.324
I see what you mean. Well, here.

24:35.781 --> 24:38.374
Wrap yourself in this blanket.

24:38.784 --> 24:42.172
And get some of this hot
coffee inside of you.

24:42.370 --> 24:44.548
Thanks, mister.

24:44.956 --> 24:47.291
- Cigar.
- Your wife sent them.

24:47.292 --> 24:51.337
She did? That's funny. She always
beefs when I smoke a cigar.

24:51.338 --> 24:54.048
- Hey, what's your name, mister?
- Charlie Tatum.

24:54.049 --> 24:57.936
Just driving by the trading
post when I heard about it.

24:58.386 --> 25:00.262
Hey, what happened to
those other fellows?

25:00.263 --> 25:02.139
I heard them, but they went away.

25:02.140 --> 25:03.682
Why don't they do something
about getting me out?

25:03.683 --> 25:06.894
Easy, Leo. They'll get you out.
But you know what you just said.

25:06.895 --> 25:09.730
It takes figuring, maybe
some special equipment.

25:09.731 --> 25:11.398
They're not gonna leave
me here overnight?

25:11.399 --> 25:15.528
They'll do it as fast as they
can, but they got to do it right.

25:15.529 --> 25:19.368
Yeah, I know. Only that's
a pretty heavy mountain.

25:19.699 --> 25:21.664
Tell me, Leo. How'd it happen?

25:21.993 --> 25:23.160
I...

25:23.161 --> 25:27.540
I guess I crawled in too far this time.
You've got to, to find a good one.

25:27.541 --> 25:30.762
Back there, it's pretty
well cleaned out.

25:31.586 --> 25:35.094
But I found me a beauty.
Worth 50 bucks any day.

25:37.134 --> 25:39.596
Just then the whole floor
caved in under me.

25:41.179 --> 25:44.520
I guess maybe they didn't
want me to have it.

25:44.641 --> 25:46.725
They? Who are they?

25:46.726 --> 25:50.482
The Indian dead. They're
all around here.

25:51.273 --> 25:54.316
This is a tomb, mister,
with mummies 400 years old.

25:54.317 --> 25:57.361
They used to bury them here
with these jars alongside,

25:57.362 --> 25:59.405
you know, full of corn and wampum.

25:59.406 --> 26:02.082
That's worthwhile
knowing, Leo. Go on.

26:02.784 --> 26:04.084
I...

26:04.536 --> 26:06.454
I guess maybe they've been
watching me all the time

26:06.455 --> 26:08.706
I've been taking things
out of here and got mad.

26:08.707 --> 26:10.671
Bad spirits, huh?

26:13.211 --> 26:16.547
I guess you're gonna laugh
at me, think I'm crazy.

26:16.548 --> 26:19.467
But when you lie down here all by
yourself, you get to thinking.

26:19.468 --> 26:21.385
Do me a favour, will you?

26:21.386 --> 26:24.894
Hold up that jar again.
And look at me.

26:25.056 --> 26:27.892
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Taking your picture.

26:27.893 --> 26:29.525
What for?

26:30.353 --> 26:32.354
- Gonna put it in the paper.
- What kind of paper?

26:32.355 --> 26:34.482
In a newspaper in Albuquerque.

26:34.483 --> 26:35.983
- My picture?
- Certainly.

26:35.984 --> 26:39.236
- Honest?
- Everybody'll want to see how you look.

26:39.237 --> 26:41.447
And I'm gonna write a story.
They'll wanna know all about you.

26:41.448 --> 26:42.656
They'll be pulling for you.

26:42.657 --> 26:45.535
How do you like that?
Me in a paper.

26:45.869 --> 26:49.258
- Let's take another one, Leo.
- Oh, let me wipe my face first.

26:50.415 --> 26:51.964
Hold it.

26:52.250 --> 26:54.085
And don't say anything about
those Indian spirits.

26:54.086 --> 26:55.795
I don't want anybody
to think I'm scared.

26:55.796 --> 26:58.425
Don't worry, Leo. I'm your pal.

26:59.716 --> 27:02.343
I know. That's why
I can talk to you.

27:02.344 --> 27:04.190
Sure, you can.

27:05.055 --> 27:07.973
You know, in the army,
I was plenty scared, too.

27:07.974 --> 27:10.188
Like when my outfit
landed in Italy.

27:11.269 --> 27:15.488
Only in the army, it's different.
There, everybody's scared.

27:16.316 --> 27:19.455
Your barge is gonna land.
You know you're gonna die.

27:20.404 --> 27:23.543
And then a guy starts
singing, soft-like.

27:24.449 --> 27:29.332
Then a guy next to you starts singing.
Pretty soon, you're singing, too.

27:30.831 --> 27:33.666
<i>Hut-Sut Rawlson on the rillerah</i>

27:33.667 --> 27:36.502
<i>And a brawla, brawla sooit</i>

27:36.503 --> 27:38.599
<i>Hut-Sut Rawlson</i>

27:40.340 --> 27:43.217
Well, it worked, didn't it?
Nothing happened to you.

27:43.218 --> 27:46.689
Not a thing, except I got
the mumps in Naples.

27:47.472 --> 27:49.974
Well, you light yourself a cigar,
Leo. I gotta say so long.

27:49.975 --> 27:51.684
I certainly wish you could
stay a while longer.

27:51.685 --> 27:55.062
So do I. But there's a lot to do
outside getting things organised.

27:55.063 --> 27:57.858
Well, you wanna get out, don't you?

27:59.484 --> 28:01.485
Looks like it's gonna
be a long night.

28:01.486 --> 28:03.738
None of that. Come on, Leo.

28:03.739 --> 28:06.657
<i>Hut-Sut Rawlson on the rillerah</i>

28:06.658 --> 28:08.421
<i>And a...</i>

28:08.702 --> 28:10.995
I said come on now. All together.

28:10.996 --> 28:13.789
<i>Hut-Sut Rawlson on the rillerah</i>

28:13.790 --> 28:16.709
<i>And a brawla, brawla sooit</i>

28:16.710 --> 28:19.336
<i>Hut-Sut Rawlson on the rillerah</i>

28:19.337 --> 28:22.089
<i>And a brawla sooit</i>

28:22.090 --> 28:24.633
<i>Hut-Sut Rawlson on the rillerah</i>

28:24.634 --> 28:27.803
<i>And a brawla, brawla sooit</i>

28:27.804 --> 28:30.306
<i>Hut-Sut Rawlson on the rillerah</i>

28:30.307 --> 28:32.568
<i>And a brawla...</i>

28:38.690 --> 28:40.983
<i>The brawla is the boy and girl</i>

28:40.984 --> 28:42.617
<i>The Hut...</i>

28:47.866 --> 28:50.618
<i>Hut-Sut Rawlson on the rillerah</i>

28:50.619 --> 28:53.287
<i>And a brawla, brawla sooit</i>

28:53.288 --> 28:56.332
<i>Hut-Sut Rawlson on the rillerah</i>

28:56.333 --> 28:58.834
<i>And a brawla sooit</i>

28:58.835 --> 29:01.045
<i>Hut-Sut Rawlson on the rillerah</i>

29:01.046 --> 29:03.631
What's the idea?
Have you gone nuts?

29:03.632 --> 29:06.634
Just a couple of pals singing.
What's wrong with that?

29:06.635 --> 29:10.179
I got me some pictures, fan.
Guard them with your life.

29:10.180 --> 29:12.192
Let's get moving.

29:16.812 --> 29:18.604
What happened?

29:18.605 --> 29:21.607
- Aren't you gonna tell me?
- Quiet, Herbie. Quiet.

29:21.608 --> 29:23.192
I'm writing the lead to the story.

29:23.193 --> 29:25.786
- Well, what is the story?
- Big.

29:26.113 --> 29:30.415
As big as they come, I think.
Maybe bigger than Floyd Collins.

29:30.659 --> 29:33.584
- Floyd Collins plus.
- Plus what?

29:34.329 --> 29:37.800
Plus King Tut. You remember
that one, don't you?

29:38.125 --> 29:42.545
The curse of the old Egyptian pharaoh
when they came to rob his tomb?

29:42.546 --> 29:46.764
How's that for an angle?
"King Tut in New Mexico."

29:47.092 --> 29:52.473
"Curse of the old Indian chief.
White man half buried by angry spirits."

29:53.849 --> 29:57.893
"What will they do? Will they
spare him? Will they crush him?"

29:57.894 --> 30:01.313
Give it to me straight, Chuck.
How does it look? Can they get him out?

30:01.314 --> 30:03.691
- Certainly.
- Well, how soon?

30:03.692 --> 30:05.455
I don't know.

30:05.902 --> 30:08.532
Floyd Collins lasted 18 days.

30:09.781 --> 30:11.959
I don't need 18 days.

30:12.242 --> 30:15.037
If I just had one week of this...

30:15.412 --> 30:18.836
- Oh, brother.
- You're kidding, Chuck.

30:19.166 --> 30:22.334
You don't really wish
for anything like that.

30:22.335 --> 30:24.336
I'm not wishing for anything.

30:24.337 --> 30:28.390
I don't make things happen.
All I do is write about them.

30:41.438 --> 30:42.772
- Did you reach him?
- I saw him.

30:42.773 --> 30:44.648
- I talked to him.
- Couldn't you bring him out? Is he alive?

30:44.649 --> 30:46.358
You can be sure of one
thing, we'll get him out.

30:46.359 --> 30:47.526
Today? Tonight?

30:47.527 --> 30:49.403
I'm afraid not. There's nothing
we can do here tonight.

30:49.404 --> 30:50.571
Tomorrow?

30:50.572 --> 30:52.698
As soon as we get an
engineering crew on the job.

30:52.699 --> 30:57.416
And I'm gonna get them, Mr Minosa,
the best. And I'll get that doctor.

30:58.705 --> 30:59.955
And the sheriff, too.

30:59.956 --> 31:01.957
The sheriff's tied up in
Los Barrios until Monday.

31:01.958 --> 31:05.127
- You better talk to me.
- Tied up in Los Barrios, huh?

31:05.128 --> 31:08.839
I'll bet he's at that rattlesnake hunt.
Chances are the doctor, too.

31:08.840 --> 31:12.093
How do you like that? A man
could be dying here, and...

31:12.094 --> 31:15.221
- Oh, I'm sorry, Mrs Minosa.
- I know all about that sheriff.

31:15.222 --> 31:19.100
He stops in every week for a steak
dinner and never picks up the cheque.

31:19.101 --> 31:21.852
He'll be here. They'll all be here.

31:21.853 --> 31:25.158
The sheriff, the doctor,
the engineer.

31:26.108 --> 31:27.900
- You got a phone at the trading post?
- Yeah.

31:27.901 --> 31:31.657
Let's get started. We got a
lot of telephoning to do.

31:39.913 --> 31:42.293
- The phone's inside.
- Okay.

31:43.166 --> 31:45.209
Fill her up, Herbie.
You're going back to town.

31:45.210 --> 31:46.890
All right.

31:49.005 --> 31:50.638
Over there.

31:51.800 --> 31:54.885
There's the doctor's number.
Dr Hilton.

31:54.886 --> 31:57.017
The sheriff's number's there, too.

31:58.014 --> 32:01.403
Oh, that's the sheriff, huh?
Gus Kretzer.

32:02.269 --> 32:04.311
We'll get some action
here. You'll see.

32:04.312 --> 32:05.980
By tomorrow, this
place will be jumping

32:05.981 --> 32:09.400
if I have to call Santa Fe and
get the Governor out of bed.

32:09.401 --> 32:12.737
Oh, would it be too much trouble
to put me up for the night?

32:12.738 --> 32:15.489
Sixty beautiful rooms.
The Escudero Ritz.

32:15.490 --> 32:18.831
What'll it be, ocean
view or mountain view?

32:19.411 --> 32:23.665
Anything. A cot. A couple of
chairs in here will do fine.

32:29.379 --> 32:32.803
Operator? Get me Albuquerque 4923.

32:33.550 --> 32:36.010
- What's the number here?
- Escudero 2.

32:36.011 --> 32:37.690
Escudero 2.

32:45.437 --> 32:46.939
Hello?

32:53.028 --> 32:57.875
<i>Sun-Bulletin?</i> This is Tatum speaking.
Get me Mr Boot, and make it fast.

33:08.794 --> 33:10.841
Mr Boot? Tatum.

33:11.505 --> 33:14.507
No, nothing's wrong.
Quite the contrary.

33:14.508 --> 33:17.384
Uh-uh. I'm in a dreamy
little spot called Escudero

33:17.385 --> 33:19.762
about three hours down the line.

33:19.763 --> 33:23.650
Forget the rattlesnakes.
We got something nicer here.

33:23.934 --> 33:27.903
We got birds, vultures.
Seven of them.

33:28.313 --> 33:29.939
How does this hit you?

33:29.940 --> 33:33.198
"The curse of the mountain
of the seven vultures."

33:33.527 --> 33:36.153
Of course you don't know what I'm
talking about, but I'm gonna tell you.

33:36.154 --> 33:40.282
And wait till you see the pictures.
I'm sending them up with Herbie...

33:40.283 --> 33:42.829
No, I'm not drunk, Mr Boot.

33:42.953 --> 33:45.996
Maybe a little excited, because
unless war is declared tonight,

33:45.997 --> 33:47.962
here's your front-page
feature. Now...

34:04.307 --> 34:05.724
How much is it, Mr Minosa?

34:05.725 --> 34:10.739
No, sir, I wouldn't take your money,
not after all you're doing for my boy.

35:52.582 --> 35:55.045
- Hi.
- Morning.

36:01.133 --> 36:04.260
The construction boss show up?
Or the sheriff?

36:04.261 --> 36:05.940
Not yet.

36:06.096 --> 36:08.848
From the way you were talking, I thought
you'd get the Governor down here.

36:08.849 --> 36:11.892
- The Marines, too.
- It's all taken care of.

36:11.893 --> 36:14.061
They got a construction crew
together, machinery too,

36:14.062 --> 36:16.605
and they're on their way from Los
Barrios now, Sunday or no Sunday.

36:16.606 --> 36:18.315
- Yap, yap.
- I've talked to the doctor.

36:18.316 --> 36:20.909
We're taking him in as soon
as they clear the passage.

36:21.194 --> 36:23.195
And the sheriff will
be on the job, too.

36:23.196 --> 36:24.780
Yap, yap, yap, yap, yap.

36:24.781 --> 36:28.122
Look, madam, when I say
I deliver, I deliver.

36:28.577 --> 36:30.874
Where are the old folks?

36:30.954 --> 36:32.966
Went to early mass.

36:35.584 --> 36:38.502
What's that you been playing
on your typewriter all night?

36:38.503 --> 36:41.922
From upstairs, it sounded
like that <i>Sabre Dance.</i>

36:41.923 --> 36:45.098
With all this trouble, I didn't
think you could sleep anyhow.

36:45.927 --> 36:48.936
I've had enough sleep,
five years of it.

36:49.931 --> 36:53.851
What else could you do in Escudero?
Look at the family album?

36:53.852 --> 36:56.861
- Where'd you get it?
- From Mama Minosa.

36:57.022 --> 36:58.701
Just shows.

36:58.857 --> 37:01.567
Yesterday, you never
even heard of Leo.

37:01.568 --> 37:04.361
Today, you can't know
enough about him.

37:04.362 --> 37:06.375
Aren't you sweet?

37:09.076 --> 37:11.660
Good-looking kid in his
uniform, wasn't he?

37:11.661 --> 37:14.457
Him and eight million other guys.

37:14.873 --> 37:17.875
See our wedding picture?
Bet you didn't even recognise me.

37:17.876 --> 37:20.885
Sure, I did. You were
a brunette then.

37:20.962 --> 37:23.888
In '45? No, in '45,
I was a redhead.

37:24.341 --> 37:26.050
See how skinny I was?

37:26.051 --> 37:29.678
A hospital back in Baltimore
said I had a touch of TB.

37:29.679 --> 37:32.473
You'd never think it
to look at me now.

37:32.474 --> 37:35.565
You don't look like
a chest case to me.

37:37.604 --> 37:40.397
If you can spare this one,
I'd like to take it along,

37:40.398 --> 37:43.276
in case I forget
what he looks like.

37:44.277 --> 37:45.945
What time is it?

37:45.946 --> 37:48.989
5:45. What's all this about?

37:48.990 --> 37:51.659
- I'm grabbing the early bus.
- Where to?

37:51.660 --> 37:55.333
Out of here fast. As far
as 11 bucks will take me.

37:55.747 --> 37:57.873
I'm blowing this place.

37:57.874 --> 38:01.293
- You picked a fine time.
- I've left him before.

38:01.294 --> 38:03.587
Once, I got as far as
Dodge City, Kansas,

38:03.588 --> 38:06.215
in a big, blue convertible
that stopped by for gas.

38:06.216 --> 38:08.845
It must have cost $4,000, easy.

38:09.886 --> 38:13.642
But Leo caught up with me.
I told him I was through.

38:14.224 --> 38:17.351
I told him it was no good
any more. This isn't for me.

38:17.352 --> 38:18.854
What is?

38:19.020 --> 38:21.856
I bet he took you out of some
dime-a-dance joint in Baltimore.

38:21.857 --> 38:23.739
- Nightclub.
- Saloon.

38:24.568 --> 38:27.707
All right. Saloon.
You know what he told me?

38:27.863 --> 38:32.378
He told me he had 160 acres in
New Mexico and a big business.

38:32.659 --> 38:36.704
Look at us, we sell eight hamburgers
a week and a case of soda pop,

38:36.705 --> 38:39.165
and once in a while,
a Navajo rug maybe.

38:39.166 --> 38:42.793
He married you, didn't he? Brought
you out here, fed you, nursed you.

38:42.794 --> 38:47.179
And I thanked him plenty. I've
been thanking him for five years.

38:47.299 --> 38:49.394
That makes us even.

38:51.386 --> 38:53.233
So long, Jack.

38:53.680 --> 38:55.265
Nice kid.

38:56.808 --> 38:59.018
Got a little jump on
him this time, huh?

38:59.019 --> 39:02.188
Can't run after you, not lying there
with those rocks on his legs.

39:02.189 --> 39:04.899
Look who's talking.
Much you care about Leo.

39:04.900 --> 39:06.984
I'm onto you. You're
working for a newspaper.

39:06.985 --> 39:09.278
All you want is something
you can print.

39:09.279 --> 39:12.869
Honey, you like those rocks
just as much as I do.

39:38.683 --> 39:40.363
Say, lady.

39:41.895 --> 39:43.771
Excuse me, we're a
little mixed up here.

39:43.772 --> 39:45.856
Are we on the right
road to Escudero?

39:45.857 --> 39:47.870
This is Escudero.

39:48.902 --> 39:51.278
- Is that the mountain?
- Is he still in there?

39:51.279 --> 39:53.280
That's the mountain,
and he's still in there.

39:53.281 --> 39:55.074
Anything else you wanna know?

39:55.075 --> 39:57.660
No. No, just stopping
by to take a look.

39:57.661 --> 40:00.788
The name's Federber. We're on
our way to Bottomless Lake.

40:00.789 --> 40:02.665
Gonna get in a week of
fishing and boating.

40:02.666 --> 40:06.168
- Thought, as long as we're this close...
- Glad you dropped in, folks.

40:06.169 --> 40:07.503
How'd you hear about it?

40:07.504 --> 40:10.840
- Are you one of the family?
- No. Just a friend.

40:10.841 --> 40:13.968
Well, haven't you seen
the paper? It's full of it.

40:13.969 --> 40:16.720
- Got one?
- Sure. Picked one up in Albuquerque.

40:16.721 --> 40:18.806
Come on, Nellie. Tilt.

40:18.807 --> 40:20.356
Thanks.

40:20.809 --> 40:23.144
We thought there'd be a
lot of digging going on.

40:23.145 --> 40:26.319
- Where is everybody?
- Scared of those Indian spooks, huh?

40:28.567 --> 40:30.735
When are they gonna
start doing something?

40:30.736 --> 40:34.488
Any minute now. They're on
the way. Aren't they, mister?

40:34.489 --> 40:36.949
I guess it's all right if we
drive up there, isn't it?

40:36.950 --> 40:39.164
Go ahead. Help yourself.

40:39.202 --> 40:41.579
What do you say, Nellie?
Just a half an hour?

40:41.580 --> 40:44.999
All right. Later on, we can
have a nice breakfast here.

40:45.000 --> 40:47.973
That is, if it won't
disturb the family.

40:48.211 --> 40:51.088
- It's all right. You can get breakfast.
- Thanks.

40:51.089 --> 40:53.466
Wake up the kids, Nellie.
They should see this.

40:53.467 --> 40:55.426
This is very instructive.

40:55.427 --> 40:57.771
Walter, Willie. Wake up.

41:11.526 --> 41:14.111
Hey, you look pretty good here.

41:14.112 --> 41:16.489
Wanna hear what I wrote about you?

41:16.490 --> 41:18.616
"The grief-stricken wife
with a tear-stained face,"

41:18.617 --> 41:22.036
"trying to fight her way into the
cave to be at her husband's side."

41:22.037 --> 41:25.212
Tough. You'll just
have to rewrite me.

41:25.624 --> 41:30.169
In a pig's eye. This is the way it reads
best, this is the way it's gonna be.

41:30.170 --> 41:31.712
In tomorrow's paper
and the next day's.

41:31.713 --> 41:35.174
It's the way people like it.
It's the way I'm gonna play it.

41:35.175 --> 41:36.677
Get this.

41:36.718 --> 41:40.596
There's three of us buried
here, Leo, me and you.

41:40.597 --> 41:43.057
We all wanna get out,
and we're going to.

41:43.058 --> 41:47.269
Only I'm going back in style.
You can, too, if you like.

41:47.270 --> 41:50.030
Not with any 11 stinking dollars.

41:51.399 --> 41:55.319
You saw those people. To you,
they're a couple of squares, huh?

41:55.320 --> 41:59.407
To me, they're just the beginning.
To me, they're Mr and Mrs America.

41:59.408 --> 42:04.537
I wasn't sure before, but now I know.
They're going for it. They'll eat it up.

42:04.538 --> 42:06.997
The story and the hamburgers.

42:06.998 --> 42:10.626
You'll sell all your hamburgers,
hot dogs, soda pop

42:10.627 --> 42:12.971
and all your Navajo rugs.

42:13.213 --> 42:17.467
There's gonna be real dough in
that cash register by tonight.

42:27.769 --> 42:32.486
When they bleached your hair, they
must've bleached your brains, too.

43:27.120 --> 43:29.789
Hello there, Mr Minosa.
Anything new with Leo?

43:29.790 --> 43:33.375
Not yet. Mr Tatum's down
there now with the doctor.

43:33.376 --> 43:34.795
Okay.

43:45.305 --> 43:47.848
Hey! That'll be two bits.

43:47.849 --> 43:50.601
- It's the press.
- Twenty-five cents.

43:50.602 --> 43:53.229
- Newspaper. We never pay.
- Everybody pays.

43:53.230 --> 43:55.823
Mrs Minosa says so. Two bits.

43:58.318 --> 44:00.200
Now keep moving.

44:34.729 --> 44:36.730
We'll have that air going in
about 20 minutes, Doctor.

44:36.731 --> 44:39.066
I could use a little of it myself.

44:39.067 --> 44:42.787
- Thank you, Doctor.
- I'll send over some aureomycin.

44:42.988 --> 44:45.364
That's every four hours
for that one, isn't it?

44:45.365 --> 44:47.116
Yes. The caffeine if he feels weak,

44:47.117 --> 44:49.201
and the Demerol if the
pain gets very bad.

44:49.202 --> 44:51.704
- Say, about every three hours.
- I got it.

44:51.705 --> 44:53.122
As soon as I can get close enough,

44:53.123 --> 44:55.916
I'll give him a shot of
tetanus-gas gangrene antitoxin.

44:55.917 --> 44:59.545
But it's all right for the time being.
In fact, any time within a week.

44:59.546 --> 45:02.388
But we'll have him out before then?

45:02.466 --> 45:04.050
Oh, sure.

45:05.010 --> 45:06.642
Say, Doc?

45:07.679 --> 45:09.930
He's a pretty rugged
customer, isn't he?

45:09.931 --> 45:12.727
Leo? They don't come any tougher.

45:12.809 --> 45:14.727
He walked around with a burst
appendix for three days,

45:14.728 --> 45:17.313
because he promised his wife
he'd take her to a square dance.

45:17.314 --> 45:20.608
Well, as soon as you get him free,
I can start to work on him.

45:20.609 --> 45:22.359
Call me anytime, night or day.

45:22.360 --> 45:24.737
- I certainly will, Doctor. So long.
- Goodbye.

45:24.738 --> 45:26.536
Thanks a lot.

45:32.120 --> 45:33.996
It's a fine thing. Now I
have to pay to see you.

45:33.997 --> 45:35.915
- Howdy, fan.
- Did you read the paper?

45:35.916 --> 45:37.917
That I did. Broke pretty good, huh?

45:37.918 --> 45:39.877
Boot flashed a couple hundred
words over the wires,

45:39.878 --> 45:41.045
and they came back for more.

45:41.046 --> 45:43.089
- They want all we've got.
- Yeah, it figures.

45:43.090 --> 45:45.549
We wired all the art, too.
What a break for me.

45:45.550 --> 45:47.718
If this keeps up, maybe <i>Life</i>
will go for it, or <i>Look,</i>

45:47.719 --> 45:49.601
one of those four-page spreads.

45:51.473 --> 45:53.557
You like it now, don't you?

45:53.558 --> 45:57.730
Well, everybody likes a break.
We didn't make it happen.

45:59.856 --> 46:02.233
Oh, Smollett! How's it look?

46:02.234 --> 46:04.402
Don't know yet. Lots of problems.

46:04.403 --> 46:07.571
We've been figuring on doing some
bulkheading and cross-bracing.

46:07.572 --> 46:10.616
But those old walls, I don't know.

46:10.617 --> 46:14.041
All right, boys, start
bringing those jacks in.

46:14.704 --> 46:16.705
Well, it looks like we'll
be here for a while.

46:16.706 --> 46:19.125
I brought you enough for a couple
of days, some shirts and shorts.

46:19.126 --> 46:22.336
- A couple of bottles.
- Save it, fan. No booze.

46:22.337 --> 46:24.800
- Not for the duration.
- Hey, you!

46:26.174 --> 46:29.218
The sheriff wants to see you
down at the trading post.

46:29.219 --> 46:32.388
And don't waste none of his time,
because he ain't staying around long.

46:32.389 --> 46:34.890
- Maybe you ain't, either.
- You don't say?

46:34.891 --> 46:38.150
You wanna know something?
He don't like you.

46:38.353 --> 46:40.983
And I was gonna propose to him.

46:53.785 --> 46:55.953
He won't eat any steak.

46:55.954 --> 46:59.915
Maybe he'd like a little raw
hamburger or some milk maybe.

46:59.916 --> 47:02.462
After all, he's only a baby.

47:03.253 --> 47:06.048
Try him with a lollipop, Sheriff.

47:08.967 --> 47:10.896
Or how about my right arm?

47:11.887 --> 47:15.723
He'd like that. You would,
too, wouldn't you?

47:15.724 --> 47:19.727
So you're that Tatum guy that was
popping off over the phone last night.

47:19.728 --> 47:22.521
Not popping off, Sheriff.
Just threatening.

47:22.522 --> 47:24.815
You play along with me,
and I'll have you re-elected.

47:24.816 --> 47:27.610
You don't, and I'll crucify you.
That's all I said. Remember?

47:27.611 --> 47:32.031
I think I'll have my boys take you to
the county line and throw you out.

47:32.032 --> 47:35.868
Throw out your campaign manager?
You need plenty of help, Kretzer.

47:35.869 --> 47:39.121
And maybe before I throw you out,
I'll toss you in the clink for a while.

47:39.122 --> 47:41.336
Wasting your time on
a rattlesnake hunt.

47:42.959 --> 47:46.045
- This is where the votes are.
- What do you know about votes?

47:46.046 --> 47:49.173
There's seven here in
Escudero, 700 up there.

47:49.174 --> 47:52.847
We had a big barbecue, and I
made a speech, a good one, too.

47:53.345 --> 47:54.804
Then we sat down to a
little poker game,

47:54.805 --> 47:57.681
and you started bothering me,
right in the middle of a hand.

47:57.682 --> 48:00.359
What'd you have, pair of deuces?

48:00.769 --> 48:02.520
This is better.

48:02.521 --> 48:05.316
Here we've got an ace in the hole.

48:07.734 --> 48:09.568
- Two candy bars, please.
- A couple of hamburgers, please.

48:09.569 --> 48:11.070
How much are those
Swiss-cheese sandwiches?

48:11.071 --> 48:13.030
- I'll have the coffee.
- I'll take a coffee.

48:13.031 --> 48:16.954
Come on, Mama. I need some help.
We're swamped out here.

48:17.285 --> 48:18.870
Come on.

48:23.291 --> 48:27.044
Now, how's this, Sheriff? By tomorrow,
I'll have your name all over the paper.

48:27.045 --> 48:29.213
"The man who rushed here
at the first cry for help"

48:29.214 --> 48:31.048
"to direct the rescue operation."

48:31.049 --> 48:33.717
By Tuesday, everyone in
the state will know you.

48:33.718 --> 48:37.763
"Gus Kretzer, the tireless public
servant who never spares himself."

48:37.764 --> 48:40.349
I'll pile it on every day.

48:40.350 --> 48:43.608
Six days of this and
I'll make you a hero.

48:44.229 --> 48:45.813
The election's in the bag.

48:45.814 --> 48:49.902
In the bag? The guys running
against you will vote for you.

48:50.485 --> 48:54.205
Okay, I'm a hero. And
what do I make you?

48:54.698 --> 48:56.741
Now here's the deal.

48:56.742 --> 48:58.868
The way things look, there's
gonna be other newspapermen

48:58.869 --> 49:02.293
trying to horn in on
this story. A lot of them.

49:02.414 --> 49:05.126
Maybe all the way from New York.

49:05.959 --> 49:07.971
This is my story.

49:08.837 --> 49:11.181
And I wanna keep it mine.

49:12.799 --> 49:14.977
You're gonna help me.

49:16.344 --> 49:18.554
Mr Tatum, we're moving
you into our room.

49:18.555 --> 49:20.222
It's a good, comfortable bed.

49:20.223 --> 49:22.933
Oh, no, Mr Minosa. I don't
want to put anybody out.

49:22.934 --> 49:26.103
Mama and I will be fine.
This is a great honour.

49:26.104 --> 49:27.605
Okay. Thanks.

49:27.606 --> 49:30.065
Oh, Herbie, unpack for me,
will you? And stand by.

49:30.066 --> 49:33.455
We're gonna take some
pictures of the sheriff.

49:36.323 --> 49:39.116
Guess I'm getting too old
to crawl around in there.

49:39.117 --> 49:41.494
- How about a cup of coffee?
- Make it two.

49:41.495 --> 49:43.127
Coming up.

49:43.663 --> 49:45.925
- What's the latest?
- Not too good.

49:45.999 --> 49:48.042
There must be a pretty deep
fault underneath there,

49:48.043 --> 49:49.877
or it wouldn't have caved in.

49:49.878 --> 49:51.003
How long will it take?

49:51.004 --> 49:53.422
Of course we haven't been
able to get all the way back.

49:53.423 --> 49:55.549
There's a lot of
shoring to do first.

49:55.550 --> 49:58.636
That means getting those
bulkhead timbers placed right.

49:58.637 --> 50:01.472
- Then there's all that cross-bracing.
- How long?

50:01.473 --> 50:03.933
When we get that done, we ought
to be able to start operating.

50:03.934 --> 50:06.018
Moving those heavy slabs and stones

50:06.019 --> 50:09.313
so the whole shebang doesn't come
crashing in on us and on him.

50:09.314 --> 50:13.450
- How long?
- Well, Gus, I can't tell you exactly.

50:13.819 --> 50:16.792
But I don't see how we can
do it under 16 hours.

50:18.782 --> 50:20.082
Uh-uh.

50:20.617 --> 50:25.246
Well, maybe I can do it in 12 hours
if I send for a second crew.

50:25.247 --> 50:26.997
Although some of the men
don't want to work,

50:26.998 --> 50:29.972
on account of that
jinx you wrote about.

50:31.837 --> 50:36.715
Look, Mr Smollett, I'm no engineer,
but the way you wanna do it,

50:36.716 --> 50:40.187
those crumbling walls
and piles of stones,

50:40.762 --> 50:43.180
isn't that kind of
dangerous for your men?

50:43.181 --> 50:46.024
Not after we get the walls braced.

50:46.476 --> 50:50.438
Suppose we set up a drill
on top of the mountain

50:50.439 --> 50:52.570
and go straight down.

50:52.774 --> 50:55.155
Cut through all that rock?

50:55.736 --> 50:58.404
Do you know how long
that would take?

50:58.405 --> 50:59.697
You tell me.

50:59.698 --> 51:02.078
Six, maybe seven days.

51:02.409 --> 51:04.706
It's a great big job.

51:04.870 --> 51:06.954
Have you got any drills like that?

51:06.955 --> 51:09.715
Yes, sir, but it's not necessary.

51:09.916 --> 51:13.002
Once we get that back part
shored up, I think...

51:13.003 --> 51:16.172
You're thinking too much.
Let Mr Tatum do the thinking.

51:16.173 --> 51:17.840
But he's all wrong.

51:17.841 --> 51:20.259
- I think...
- You're thinking again, Sam.

51:20.260 --> 51:24.638
A few years ago, you was a truck driver.
Now that I'm sheriff, you're a contractor.

51:24.639 --> 51:27.695
Do you want to be a
truck driver again?

51:29.352 --> 51:31.145
All right, Gus,

51:31.146 --> 51:34.732
if that's the way you want
it, I'll set the drill.

51:34.733 --> 51:39.035
But that fellow in there.
Seven days.

51:40.280 --> 51:43.574
I know what's in your mind,
Mr Smollett, and it does you credit.

51:43.575 --> 51:47.331
Leo's a rugged boy. The
doctor told me that himself.

51:47.496 --> 51:51.050
He'll get the best of
care, so don't worry.

51:52.209 --> 51:53.676
Sugar?

51:54.044 --> 51:56.462
- Hey, how about some cigarettes?
- Couple of hot dogs, please.

51:56.463 --> 51:59.340
Don't you wanna be paid, lady? We had
four hamburgers and four coffees.

51:59.341 --> 52:02.136
- That's $1.20.
- Can you change a $50?

52:11.686 --> 52:14.945
- Hey, how about one here, Chuck?
- Okay, fan.

52:19.694 --> 52:21.445
Get me a few of Mr Smollett,

52:21.446 --> 52:24.907
the man whose know-how is gonna
save the life of Leo Minosa.

52:24.908 --> 52:29.080
You'll be the biggest contractor
in the business, I bet you.

52:29.162 --> 52:33.547
And let's get that drill. See you,
gentlemen. Lot of work to do.

53:15.709 --> 53:17.044
Yes?

53:18.837 --> 53:21.430
Come on, come on. What is it?

53:22.841 --> 53:25.926
I met a lot of hard-boiled
eggs in my life,

53:25.927 --> 53:28.723
but you, you're 20 minutes.

53:30.599 --> 53:34.101
Is that a boost or a knock? Because
I haven't time to figure it out.

53:34.102 --> 53:36.061
I've been doing my own figuring.

53:36.062 --> 53:40.115
Took in 70 bucks so far. By
tonight, it ought to be $150.

53:40.233 --> 53:43.788
Seven times $150.
That's over a grand.

53:45.906 --> 53:48.783
That's the first grand I ever had.

53:49.659 --> 53:51.162
Thanks.

53:53.205 --> 53:54.968
Thanks a lot.

53:57.584 --> 54:02.266
Look, Mrs Minosa, your husband's
stuck under a mountain.

54:02.464 --> 54:06.600
You're worried sick. That's
the way the story goes.

54:07.594 --> 54:10.306
Now get the smile off your face.

54:10.472 --> 54:14.767
It's been a nice day, Chuck.
I feel like smiling.

54:14.768 --> 54:17.148
You heard me. Get it off.

54:20.899 --> 54:22.484
Make me.

54:26.363 --> 54:28.458
That's more like it.

54:30.117 --> 54:34.495
And don't wipe those tears. That's
the way you're supposed to look.

54:34.496 --> 54:36.840
Put on your wedding ring.

54:36.873 --> 54:39.847
Go on back and peddle
your hamburgers.

55:03.442 --> 55:04.775
<i>Good morning, everybody.</i>

55:04.776 --> 55:07.153
<i>This is radio station
KOAT, Albuquerque.</i>

55:07.154 --> 55:09.739
<i>Bob Bumpas speaking and bringing
you another on-the-spot report</i>

55:09.740 --> 55:11.741
<i>of the Leo Minosa rescue operation.</i>

55:18.331 --> 55:20.249
<i>the man who is in charge

55:20.250 --> 55:24.044
<i>This man, together with Sheriff Kretzer
and a crew of volunteer rescue workers,</i>

<i>is tirelessly fighting this battle

<i>If anyone can lick this,</i>

55:31.344 --> 55:34.513

<i>Ladies and gentlemen, something

<i>right in front of this
400-year-old cliff dwelling.</i>

55:39.686 --> 55:41.562
<i>A new community is springing up</i>

55:54.034 --> 55:57.119
<i>Top-flight newspapermen from the biggest

55:57.120 --> 55:59.163
<i>The most outstanding of

56:00.457 --> 56:03.834

<i>Later on in this broadcast, we will try

56:07.172 --> 56:10.508
In the meantime, I'm sure you'll
want to hear from some of the folks

56:10.509 --> 56:12.384
who have gathered here to hope
and pray for Leo's rescue.

56:12.385 --> 56:14.095
This gentleman right here,
what is your name, sir?

56:14.096 --> 56:15.805
Federber. Al Federber.

56:15.806 --> 56:17.598
What business are you
in, Mr Federber?

56:17.599 --> 56:19.600
In the insurance game, in Gallup.

56:19.601 --> 56:20.893
Feel right at home, Mr Federber.

56:20.894 --> 56:22.353
Speak right into the
microphone, please.

56:22.354 --> 56:28.067
We're from Gallup. This is
Mrs Federber and the boys.

56:28.068 --> 56:29.860
It's a very wonderful thing
to see a man and his family

56:29.861 --> 56:32.947
come all the way from Gallup to join
us here during these anxious days.

56:32.948 --> 56:35.616
Well, I didn't exactly
what you call join.

56:35.617 --> 56:38.327
I heard you talking to some other
people on the radio last night.

56:38.328 --> 56:40.413
We were over there in our
trailer having supper.

56:40.414 --> 56:42.873
And they said they were
the first ones here.

56:42.874 --> 56:46.544
Oh, I hate to call anybody a liar,
but that just plain isn't so.

56:46.545 --> 56:48.003
My wife will bear me out.

56:48.004 --> 56:51.263
Nellie, who were the first
people here? Tell them.

56:51.758 --> 56:55.219
Why, we were. I wouldn't lie
about a thing like that.

56:55.220 --> 56:56.846
I'm sure you wouldn't,
Mrs Federber.

56:56.847 --> 57:01.016
Now, Mr Federber, what is your reaction
to this wonderful job being done here?

57:01.017 --> 57:03.018
I think it's wonderful.

57:03.019 --> 57:06.147
I run up against accidents all the time.
I know what I'm talking about.

57:06.148 --> 57:08.149
I'm in the insurance game myself.

57:08.150 --> 57:11.402
You never can tell when an
accident's gonna happen.

57:11.403 --> 57:15.531
I sure hope Leo had the good sense to
provide for an emergency like this.

57:15.532 --> 57:18.284
Now, you take my outfit,
the Pacific All Risk.

57:18.285 --> 57:19.910
- We have a little policy that covers...
- Thank you.

57:19.911 --> 57:21.620
Thank you very much, Mr Federber.

57:21.621 --> 57:23.873
I'm sorry we have to interrupt
these on-the-spot interviews,

57:23.874 --> 57:27.668
but I see it's almost time for Mr Tatum to
make his first visit of the day to Leo.

57:27.669 --> 57:30.546
<i>Stand by while we
move our microphone.</i>

57:30.547 --> 57:34.849
<i>We'll try to get Mr Tatum to say a
few words to you when he reaches us.</i>

57:39.723 --> 57:41.438
Hold it, fan.

57:54.321 --> 57:58.324
Look, Mrs Minosa, they're having a rosary
at that little church this evening.

57:58.325 --> 57:59.658
I want you to be there.

57:59.659 --> 58:03.664
I don't go to church.
Kneeling bags my nylons.

58:03.789 --> 58:06.123
You're making enough dough to
buy yourself another pair.

58:06.124 --> 58:07.333
I want you to be there

58:07.334 --> 58:10.211
because I'm sending Herbie down to
get a couple of shots, understand?

58:10.212 --> 58:11.679
Okay.

58:11.922 --> 58:15.591
But only because you wrote me
up so pretty in today's paper.

58:15.592 --> 58:18.344
You sure can make with the words.

58:18.345 --> 58:21.597
"A figure of fair-haired loveliness
in the lengthening shadow

58:21.598 --> 58:24.683
- "of the cursed mountain. Beautiful..."
- Unquote.

58:24.684 --> 58:29.188
Tomorrow this'll be yesterday's
paper, and they'll wrap a fish in it.

58:29.189 --> 58:32.909
And another thing, mister.
Don't ever slap me again.

58:57.759 --> 58:59.593
Did you buy the cigars for Leo?

58:59.594 --> 59:02.638
Real Havana. The best I
could find in Albuquerque.

59:02.639 --> 59:06.434
I got a job for you, fan. Pick up
Mrs Minosa. Lorraine, I mean.

59:06.435 --> 59:09.061
Make sure she gets to
that church this evening.

59:09.062 --> 59:10.896
I want a picture of
her with her beads.

59:10.897 --> 59:13.190
If she hasn't got any,
get some for her.

59:13.191 --> 59:15.985
Sure. And how about me taking
a picture of a medicine man,

59:15.986 --> 59:18.154
you know, with the fancy
headdress and all the trimmings,

59:18.155 --> 59:21.490
- exorcising all the evil spirits?
- Now you're clicking, fan.

59:21.491 --> 59:23.576
- That's got a message.
- Thanks.

59:23.577 --> 59:24.785
When I take your copy
in Albuquerque...

59:24.786 --> 59:27.705
No more copy. Not for Boot anyhow.

59:27.706 --> 59:30.958
As of now, I'm not working with
the Albuquerque <i>Sun-Bulletin.</i>

59:30.959 --> 59:33.961
- Neither are you. We quit.
- Both of us?

59:33.962 --> 59:37.214
- Hope it's all right with you.
- Sure, Chuck.

59:37.215 --> 59:40.176
There isn't anything you could do
wrong as far as I'm concerned.

59:40.177 --> 59:41.385
But I don't get it.

59:41.386 --> 59:44.096
Quit in the middle of a story right
when it's snowballing like this?

59:44.097 --> 59:46.307
That's exactly the time
to do it, Herbie, boy.

59:46.308 --> 59:47.516
They've been lapping it up.

59:47.517 --> 59:51.228
Every word, every paper,
from New York to Los Angeles.

59:51.229 --> 59:54.488
So now we turn off the
spigot. Just like that.

59:55.442 --> 59:57.485
Watch them with their tongues out.

59:57.486 --> 01:00:01.490
Stop at that tent. Let's see
the gentlemen of the press.

01:00:01.907 --> 01:00:04.408
Look, boys, I don't care
where you come from,

01:00:04.409 --> 01:00:07.912
New York, Philadelphia,
Chicago or the moon.

01:00:07.913 --> 01:00:09.663
Nobody goes down to see Leo.

01:00:09.664 --> 01:00:12.291
- What about Tatum?
- It's out of bounds.

01:00:12.292 --> 01:00:14.835
- Why?
- Because it's dangerous down there.

01:00:14.836 --> 01:00:16.796
Because a wall could
fall in on you.

01:00:16.797 --> 01:00:20.132
Because I'm sheriff and because I'm
responsible for everybody's safety.

01:00:20.133 --> 01:00:23.052
- What about Tatum?
- Out of bounds! You heard me.

01:00:23.053 --> 01:00:25.221
What about Tatum?

01:00:25.222 --> 01:00:27.264
You're repeating yourself.

01:00:27.265 --> 01:00:31.060
This is a pretty nice place I
fixed up here for you boys.

01:00:31.061 --> 01:00:34.730
Be a shame to cut all these
wires and kick you out.

01:00:34.731 --> 01:00:36.023
Don't try it, Mr Sheriff.

01:00:36.024 --> 01:00:39.360
We wouldn't take that kind of guff from
J. Edgar Hoover, let alone from you.

01:00:39.361 --> 01:00:42.279
We came all the way out here to do
a job and we're going to do it.

01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:45.491
- It's out of bounds!
- Now you're repeating yourself!

01:00:45.492 --> 01:00:47.493
How come it isn't out
of bounds for Tatum?

01:00:47.494 --> 01:00:49.620
How come he goes in as
much as he wants to?

01:00:49.621 --> 01:00:53.294
- What about Tatum?
- That's right. What about Tatum?

01:00:53.917 --> 01:00:58.349
Howdy, fans. Why,
it's like old home week.

01:01:00.298 --> 01:01:04.593
Glad to see you, Mac. Mr McCardle,
used to work together in New York.

01:01:04.594 --> 01:01:08.097
And if it isn't Jessop.
Big-hearted Mickey Jessop.

01:01:08.098 --> 01:01:11.016
Thanks for the 50 bucks
you didn't send me.

01:01:11.017 --> 01:01:13.361
Guess he didn't get my wire.

01:01:14.020 --> 01:01:16.480
And what do you know?
Josh Morgan. Where was it?

01:01:16.481 --> 01:01:19.358
Boston? Chicago? All I
know is he's got a hernia.

01:01:19.359 --> 01:01:21.902
Sitting pretty, aren't you, Chuck?
Got everything sewed up,

01:01:21.903 --> 01:01:23.070
Leo, the sheriff.

01:01:23.071 --> 01:01:25.489
Try to talk to the father, the
mother, the wife, and what do I get?

01:01:25.490 --> 01:01:29.076
- "See Tatum! See Tatum!"
- He's a friend of the family.

01:01:29.077 --> 01:01:31.996
Now, what's your beef, fans?
You're smart cookies,

01:01:31.997 --> 01:01:34.175
big-city newspapermen.

01:01:34.666 --> 01:01:37.918
There's a lot of good stories
lying around here all yours.

01:01:37.919 --> 01:01:40.921
The weather,
the crowds, the Indians.

01:01:40.922 --> 01:01:43.931
Inside stuff, how they weave a rug.

01:01:44.301 --> 01:01:47.845
Cut it out, Chuck. We're all buddies.
We're all in the same boat.

01:01:47.846 --> 01:01:50.820
I'm in the boat.
You're in the water.

01:01:52.225 --> 01:01:55.863
Now let's see you swim, buddies.

01:01:57.481 --> 01:01:59.940
Tatum, I always knew
you were a louse.

01:01:59.941 --> 01:02:04.160
Easy, Mr Morgan. You're talking
to an officer of the law.

01:02:05.447 --> 01:02:07.239
That tin badge will do you no good.

01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:08.949
We've launched a protest
with your publisher.

01:02:08.950 --> 01:02:11.452
Launch it with the sheriff.
He's my superior.

01:02:11.453 --> 01:02:12.703
All right, we'll take
this all the way

01:02:12.704 --> 01:02:13.996
to Santa Fe, to the Governor.

01:02:13.997 --> 01:02:15.498
- And you know what he'll do.
- You bet I do.

01:02:15.499 --> 01:02:18.793
He's a fine man, and he'll take action.
He'll phone the sheriff.

01:02:18.794 --> 01:02:21.295
And I'll write him a letter and
tell him I'm doing my duty.

01:02:21.296 --> 01:02:24.090
Then you talk to the Governor again,
and he'll talk to the Attorney General,

01:02:24.091 --> 01:02:26.720
and for all I know, they'll
throw me out of here.

01:02:27.135 --> 01:02:30.137
Only by that time,
buddies, Leo will be out,

01:02:30.138 --> 01:02:33.194
and the story is finished.
Over, done!

01:02:34.434 --> 01:02:36.185
Excuse me, gentlemen.
I got a date with Leo.

01:02:36.186 --> 01:02:38.282
Popcorn! Popcorn!

01:02:39.689 --> 01:02:43.401
Just so you don't think
I'm a complete louse,

01:02:43.402 --> 01:02:45.948
I do have some news for you.

01:02:46.446 --> 01:02:48.322
Put it on a teletype.

01:02:48.323 --> 01:02:51.200
Tell your papers Chuck
Tatum is available.

01:02:51.201 --> 01:02:54.286
Looks like there's gonna be three
or four more days of hot copy.

01:02:54.287 --> 01:02:57.296
Exclusive. And Tatum
is sitting on it.

01:02:58.458 --> 01:03:00.839
So let's hear their bids.

01:03:02.879 --> 01:03:04.642
Come on, fan.

01:03:25.193 --> 01:03:28.237
Of course, it's hard to say
what we might run into.

01:03:28.238 --> 01:03:30.906
You hit rock and then
those layers of shale.

01:03:30.907 --> 01:03:34.545
That's what we call a stratified
formation. And that means...

01:03:35.537 --> 01:03:38.622
Wait just a second! There's Mr Tatum
making his way toward the cliff dwelling.

01:03:38.623 --> 01:03:42.094
I'm going to try to get
him on this microphone.

01:03:44.379 --> 01:03:46.723
Mr Tatum! Mr Tatum!

01:03:47.632 --> 01:03:50.593
Good. He's coming
over this way now.

01:03:50.594 --> 01:03:52.511
Mr Tatum, could you spare
us a few moments, please?

01:03:52.512 --> 01:03:55.639
Just a word or two about Leo and the
way things look to you down there.

01:03:55.640 --> 01:03:57.892
Well, we're making
progress, good progress,

01:03:57.893 --> 01:04:00.519
but every second counts
in this rescue operation,

01:04:00.520 --> 01:04:02.730
and I'm sure your radio
audience will excuse me,

01:04:02.731 --> 01:04:06.192
as well as Mr Smollett here if he
goes back to his post at the drill.

01:04:06.193 --> 01:04:08.778
I don't know why they have
to use a drill at all.

01:04:08.779 --> 01:04:10.821
They don't have to go from the top.

01:04:10.822 --> 01:04:12.656
There's a quicker way to
get that man out of there.

01:04:12.657 --> 01:04:15.409
- What's your name, sir?
- My name is Kusac.

01:04:15.410 --> 01:04:19.705
I did a lot of mining in my day, silver
mining, that is, up in Virginia City.

01:04:19.706 --> 01:04:21.999
Now, the way I see it...

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.085
Yes, go ahead, Mr Kusac.
We're very much interested.

01:04:24.086 --> 01:04:27.004
Well, we had cave-ins,
quite a few of them.

01:04:27.005 --> 01:04:29.465
One that I know of was
further in than yours.

01:04:29.466 --> 01:04:32.093
Were you ever in a cave-in
yourself, Mr Kusac?

01:04:32.094 --> 01:04:34.762
- No, not personally.
- Well, I was.

01:04:34.763 --> 01:04:36.764
Course you might not call
it a cave-in exactly,

01:04:36.765 --> 01:04:38.474
but I was stuck in
an elevator once,

01:04:38.475 --> 01:04:41.018
in the store I work in, between the
basement and the sub-basement.

01:04:41.019 --> 01:04:43.270
It was six hours before
they could get me out,

01:04:43.271 --> 01:04:45.064
and they had to use a
blowtorch to do it.

01:04:45.065 --> 01:04:47.907
Right from the top. Just like here.

01:04:48.026 --> 01:04:50.236
I'm afraid I gotta be
getting back to my crew.

01:04:50.237 --> 01:04:54.198
As I was trying to say,
we didn't have no big drill.

01:04:54.199 --> 01:04:55.408
We didn't need it.

01:04:55.409 --> 01:04:58.661
We just hauled in the timber and
shored up the walls all the way back.

01:04:58.662 --> 01:05:02.123
Now, if we did it that way in Virginia
City why can't we do it that way here?

01:05:02.124 --> 01:05:05.042
You're not telling me
anything I don't know.

01:05:05.043 --> 01:05:07.128
I know all about
shoring and bracing...

01:05:07.129 --> 01:05:11.424
Mr Kusac, you see, this is a cliff
dwelling and not a silver mine.

01:05:11.425 --> 01:05:16.190
Well, I think it's all the same. A man's
underground and you got to get him out.

01:05:17.097 --> 01:05:19.975
Did you get your man out, Mr Kusac?

01:05:20.100 --> 01:05:23.156
I'm afraid we didn't.
We were too late.

01:05:23.562 --> 01:05:28.113
Well, then, suppose we let Mr
Smollett do it his way, from the top.

01:05:28.150 --> 01:05:32.403
Thank you, Mr Tatum. Thank you very
much. And thank you, Mr Smollett.

01:05:32.404 --> 01:05:34.488
I know I speak for my
entire radio audience

01:05:34.489 --> 01:05:36.782
when I express my great
admiration for both of you.

01:05:36.783 --> 01:05:39.243
Mr Tatum is now approaching the
entrance to the cliff dwelling

01:05:39.244 --> 01:05:41.162
to start another one of
his perilous journeys

01:05:41.163 --> 01:05:43.914
into the underground mazes
of this dread mountain.

01:05:43.915 --> 01:05:48.134
As he waves to the crowd, you
can hear the tremendous cheer!

01:06:05.729 --> 01:06:08.192
Hiya, Leo. What do you say?

01:06:08.356 --> 01:06:10.483
Five minutes late this morning.

01:06:10.484 --> 01:06:12.946
Sorry. What's the matter?

01:06:13.070 --> 01:06:16.125
- Did you eat anything?
- I'm not hungry.

01:06:16.156 --> 01:06:18.417
- Take your pills?
- Yeah.

01:06:18.575 --> 01:06:19.784
This afternoon,
when the doctor comes,

01:06:19.785 --> 01:06:21.118
you better give yourself
another injection.

01:06:21.119 --> 01:06:24.045
I don't want any injection.
It's that drill.

01:06:24.289 --> 01:06:27.124
You gotta keep telling yourself, Leo,
they're getting closer all the time.

01:06:27.125 --> 01:06:29.335
I can't stand it. It never stops.

01:06:29.336 --> 01:06:32.338
It's like somebody was driving
crooked nails through my head.

01:06:32.339 --> 01:06:35.257
Listen to it! It's enough to
wake up the dead, I tell you...

01:06:35.258 --> 01:06:36.558
Stop!

01:06:39.304 --> 01:06:40.640
I'm sorry.

01:06:42.432 --> 01:06:45.572
Here. I brought you the paper.

01:06:47.729 --> 01:06:52.316
Thanks. Yesterday, I read there
were 2,000 people outside.

01:06:52.317 --> 01:06:54.485
Today there's over 3,000.

01:06:54.486 --> 01:06:56.612
Well, who are they?
What do they want?

01:06:56.613 --> 01:06:59.587
- They're your friends.
- They are?

01:07:00.325 --> 01:07:03.452
I guess everybody's got a lot of
friends they don't even know about.

01:07:03.453 --> 01:07:05.788
Like those guys drilling for me.

01:07:05.789 --> 01:07:10.251
Or like you, Chuck. I didn't even know
you were alive this time last week,

01:07:10.252 --> 01:07:14.340
and now you're my friend.
I guess you're my best friend.

01:07:15.966 --> 01:07:19.769
Leo, when we get you out of here

01:07:20.512 --> 01:07:23.097
I'll be going to New
York more than likely.

01:07:23.098 --> 01:07:24.932
Then I won't be
seeing you any more?

01:07:24.933 --> 01:07:27.609
No. I was just about to say

01:07:27.936 --> 01:07:31.397
when I'm in New York, I'll bring you
out to visit me for a couple of weeks

01:07:31.398 --> 01:07:34.193
or as long as you want.
Stay right with me.

01:07:34.651 --> 01:07:37.069
Hey, you ever been in New York?

01:07:37.070 --> 01:07:39.581
Been in Baltimore.
Never in New York.

01:07:40.574 --> 01:07:44.618
We're really gonna have a great time.
You'll see. We'll live it up a little.

01:07:44.619 --> 01:07:48.127
New York. Lorraine told
me a lot about New York.

01:07:49.249 --> 01:07:52.251
Does she talk about me?
Is she upset?

01:07:52.252 --> 01:07:55.178
Sure. Everybody's upset about you.

01:07:55.422 --> 01:07:58.644
- Say, Chuck, what day is this?
- Wednesday.

01:07:58.842 --> 01:08:01.051
Think there's a chance they
can get me out by Friday?

01:08:01.052 --> 01:08:02.678
Because Friday's something special.

01:08:02.679 --> 01:08:04.221
We're doing all we can.

01:08:04.222 --> 01:08:08.738
Because it's gonna be five years
that Lorraine and I were married.

01:08:09.269 --> 01:08:11.483
You know, things haven't
been so good between us.

01:08:12.105 --> 01:08:16.703
Maybe this'll make a difference.
Maybe we can start all over again.

01:08:16.734 --> 01:08:20.490
Maybe I can take her along
on that trip to New York.

01:08:23.158 --> 01:08:25.122
She's so pretty.

01:08:30.832 --> 01:08:33.167
Here you are.
Get yourself a red hot!

01:08:33.167 --> 01:08:35.679
A show-stopping monster for a dime!

01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:42.468
We can't let them come in here,
Lorraine. Not the carnival!

01:08:42.469 --> 01:08:44.345
Quiet, Papa. I told
them it was all right.

01:08:44.345 --> 01:08:46.263
It is not all right.
I won't have them here.

01:08:46.264 --> 01:08:48.724
They're paying for it. Good money.

01:08:48.725 --> 01:08:52.353
Look at them. Selling balloons
here, ice cream, hot dogs.

01:08:52.354 --> 01:08:54.479
Everybody's paying for it.

01:08:54.481 --> 01:08:57.691
Why don't we just lock up this place
and tell everybody to go home?

01:08:57.692 --> 01:08:58.859
Because they won't go home.

01:08:58.859 --> 01:09:01.779
They'll just park on the other side of
the highway and eat someplace else.

01:09:01.779 --> 01:09:03.572
Why shouldn't we get
something out of it?

01:09:03.573 --> 01:09:06.367
I don't want their money.
All I want is Leo.

01:09:06.368 --> 01:09:09.537
Who do you think the money's for?
It's for him when he gets out.

01:09:09.537 --> 01:09:12.081
He's always wanted to make
some improvements around here,

01:09:12.082 --> 01:09:16.419
build some cabins for tourists, buy a new
car, have a little money in the bank.

01:09:16.420 --> 01:09:20.804
It'll make things easier for him.
Doesn't that make sense, Papa?

01:09:24.386 --> 01:09:26.019
Mr Tatum!

01:09:28.849 --> 01:09:31.767
- How is he?
- Pretty good.

01:09:31.768 --> 01:09:34.979
Does it hurt him bad?
Is he getting any sleep?

01:09:34.979 --> 01:09:36.564
Sure, he's fine.

01:09:36.564 --> 01:09:39.524
Well, you ought to see him smoking
a cigar, reading the paper.

01:09:39.526 --> 01:09:41.068
He's making plans.

01:09:41.069 --> 01:09:45.029
All the doctor says is he's doing
as well as can be expected.

01:09:45.031 --> 01:09:48.586
- What does that mean?
- Means he's gonna be fine.

01:09:48.618 --> 01:09:52.541
Means everything's gonna be
fine, doesn't it, Mr Tatum?

01:10:08.722 --> 01:10:11.564
- How is he, mister?
- Did you see him?

01:10:12.726 --> 01:10:14.643
- Is he holding out?
- Is he all right?

01:10:14.644 --> 01:10:17.598
- What did he have to say?
- When do you think they'll get him out?

01:10:39.878 --> 01:10:43.302
Go ahead. I guess you need a drink.

01:10:48.637 --> 01:10:50.566
Care to join me?

01:10:51.932 --> 01:10:54.934
Looks like the only other glass we
have is one of these candle jiggers.

01:10:54.935 --> 01:10:57.269
Sensational copy you've
been sending in.

01:10:57.270 --> 01:11:00.189
- Glad you like it.
- Had to get out an extra every day.

01:11:00.190 --> 01:11:02.403
Circulation jumped 8,000.

01:11:02.692 --> 01:11:05.486
What did you come down for?
To pin a medal on me?

01:11:05.487 --> 01:11:09.125
You've got a medal,
and I know how you got it.

01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:15.121
What else do you know?

01:11:15.122 --> 01:11:18.624
Heard a few things in Albuquerque
about how you're handling this story.

01:11:18.625 --> 01:11:22.630
I didn't like it. Now that I'm
here, I like it even less.

01:11:23.547 --> 01:11:25.256
Suppose you stop beating
around the bush.

01:11:25.257 --> 01:11:28.259
Tatum, you've been putting a halo
around that Kretzer sheriff,

01:11:28.260 --> 01:11:32.396
so you could hog the whole story.
That's the setup, isn't it?

01:11:33.014 --> 01:11:37.726
Oh. For a minute, you had me scared.
I thought I did something real bad.

01:11:37.727 --> 01:11:41.317
You have. Kretzer should be
kicked out, not re-elected.

01:11:41.523 --> 01:11:44.108
One of these days, I'll get
the facts and print them.

01:11:44.109 --> 01:11:47.035
I think he's corrupt,
rotten, no good.

01:11:47.487 --> 01:11:50.865
He's been good to me. So there'll be
one more crooked sheriff in the world.

01:11:50.866 --> 01:11:51.991
Who cares?

01:11:51.992 --> 01:11:55.167
I do. I don't make deals.
Not my paper.

01:11:55.328 --> 01:11:58.337
Even if it does sell
8,000 more a day.

01:12:01.001 --> 01:12:03.713
Hello. Who in Chicago?

01:12:05.630 --> 01:12:09.635
Tell them Mr Tatum will be
ready to talk in half an hour.

01:12:10.552 --> 01:12:12.845
Now then, Mr Boot, I sent
you a wire this morning.

01:12:12.846 --> 01:12:14.638
- Apparently, you didn't get it.
- No, I didn't.

01:12:14.639 --> 01:12:16.932
Because you could've
saved yourself the trip.

01:12:16.933 --> 01:12:20.986
I've quit. I'm not working
for you any more.

01:12:21.897 --> 01:12:24.315
I'm sorry to hear that, Chuck.

01:12:24.316 --> 01:12:27.526
No, you're not. I'm not
your kind of newspaperman.

01:12:27.527 --> 01:12:31.995
I don't belong in your office, not with
that embroidered sign on the wall.

01:12:32.532 --> 01:12:36.371
- It gets in my way.
- Then it does bother you a little.

01:12:36.495 --> 01:12:38.829
Not enough to stop me.
I'm on my way,

01:12:38.830 --> 01:12:41.457
and if it takes a deal with a crooked
sheriff, that's all right with me.

01:12:41.458 --> 01:12:43.417
And if I have to fancy it
up with an Indian curse

01:12:43.418 --> 01:12:45.669
and a broken-hearted wife for
Leo, that's all right, too!

01:12:45.670 --> 01:12:48.976
Not with me, it isn't. And not with
a lot of others in this business.

01:12:49.257 --> 01:12:51.884
Phoney, below-the-belt journalism.
That's what it is.

01:12:51.885 --> 01:12:55.274
Not below the belt. Right
in the gut, Mr Boot.

01:12:55.347 --> 01:12:58.182
- Human interest.
- You heard me. Phoney.

01:12:58.183 --> 01:13:01.352
For all I know, there isn't
even a Leo down there.

01:13:01.353 --> 01:13:04.777
Yes, there is. Tatum
made sure of that.

01:13:08.443 --> 01:13:12.163
Look, I've waited a long
time for my turn at bat.

01:13:12.489 --> 01:13:14.573
Now that they've
pitched me a fat one,

01:13:14.574 --> 01:13:17.915
I'm gonna smack it right
out of the ballpark.

01:13:21.331 --> 01:13:24.257
Yes? What paper?

01:13:25.419 --> 01:13:28.889
Tell Philadelphia to call
back in half an hour.

01:13:31.007 --> 01:13:32.425
You know what, Chuck?

01:13:32.426 --> 01:13:35.980
I had that medicine man
stage a whole ceremonial.

01:13:36.179 --> 01:13:38.144
Hello, Mr Boot.

01:13:39.057 --> 01:13:41.684
Come on, Herbie. Get your things
together. We're going back.

01:13:41.685 --> 01:13:45.821
Tatum just hit a home run,
and the big leagues are calling.

01:13:46.773 --> 01:13:51.235
Go ahead, Herbie. Maybe Boot's right.
Maybe you'd better go back with him.

01:13:51.236 --> 01:13:53.612
But you said I could
stick with you.

01:13:53.613 --> 01:13:56.872
Give him good advice, Chuck.
You can do it.

01:13:56.992 --> 01:13:59.535
He's old enough to
make up his own mind.

01:13:59.536 --> 01:14:02.329
Everybody in this game has
to make up his own mind.

01:14:02.330 --> 01:14:04.343
I've made up mine.

01:14:05.751 --> 01:14:08.047
Hello. Yes?

01:14:10.338 --> 01:14:14.177
Sure, I'm ready to talk to
New York. Put them on.

01:14:18.930 --> 01:14:20.973
Don't be so sorry for him.

01:14:20.974 --> 01:14:23.350
What makes you think the
Albuquerque <i>Sun-Bulletin</i>

01:14:23.351 --> 01:14:24.810
is all that a kid
wants out of life?

01:14:24.811 --> 01:14:27.772
What makes you think you
have all the answers?

01:14:27.773 --> 01:14:29.190
They're out of date.

01:14:29.191 --> 01:14:31.192
High-button shoes,
belt and suspenders,

01:14:31.193 --> 01:14:32.777
they're not wearing them any more.

01:14:32.778 --> 01:14:35.488
Look at the calendar, Mr Boot.
It's the 20th century,

01:14:35.489 --> 01:14:37.031
the second half of it!

01:14:37.032 --> 01:14:41.037
You don't expect the kid to stand still.
He wants to get going. Going!

01:14:41.703 --> 01:14:43.466
Going where?

01:14:52.130 --> 01:14:54.641
Hello. Who?

01:14:55.509 --> 01:15:00.605
Mr Nagel? Not lover
boy himself. Well, well.

01:15:01.139 --> 01:15:04.683
Tell me, Mr Nagel, did you ever
repair that ceiling in your office?

01:15:04.684 --> 01:15:08.562
The one you hit the day you told me
my services were no longer required.

01:15:08.563 --> 01:15:11.482
All right, Tatum. You're
a very comical guy.

01:15:11.483 --> 01:15:15.111
And I promise I'm gonna laugh.
Hard! But not right now.

01:15:15.112 --> 01:15:17.321
What about that Minosa story?

01:15:17.322 --> 01:15:20.116
Yes, the weather's
fine in New York.

01:15:20.117 --> 01:15:24.169
No, it's not raining.
Yes, she's still here.

01:15:24.621 --> 01:15:28.590
Come on, Tatum. How much for
the Minosa story? Exclusive!

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:32.503
What? Don't you know there's
a war on somewhere?

01:15:32.504 --> 01:15:34.839
I'll give you $1,000.

01:15:34.840 --> 01:15:38.551
What do you think I got here,
a plane crash or a set of quadruplets?

01:15:38.552 --> 01:15:41.145
This is a circulation builder.

01:15:43.557 --> 01:15:48.570
It'll go another four days.
Some beautiful copy coming.

01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:53.357
Speak up fast.
There's a waiting list.

01:15:53.358 --> 01:15:54.817
So you think you've
got me over a barrel?

01:15:54.818 --> 01:15:56.569
All right, maybe you have!

01:15:56.570 --> 01:15:59.828
Give you $1,000 a day.
As long as it lasts.

01:15:59.990 --> 01:16:03.081
Mr Nagel, you're not
getting the point.

01:16:04.453 --> 01:16:06.662
It's not just $1,000 a day.

01:16:06.663 --> 01:16:10.467
It's that desk of mine I
want back when this is over.

01:16:10.834 --> 01:16:14.388
You heard me. The old
desk, the old job.

01:16:14.671 --> 01:16:17.929
Here, here, lover boy,
watch that ceiling.

01:16:20.093 --> 01:16:22.189
That's more like it.

01:16:22.679 --> 01:16:26.766
Now put the contract on the wires.
You'll get the first story in an hour.

01:16:26.767 --> 01:16:29.313
Oh, one more thing.

01:16:29.895 --> 01:16:34.197
See that there's some flowers
on my desk with a little ribbon.

01:16:34.775 --> 01:16:36.621
"Welcome Home."

01:16:40.822 --> 01:16:44.200
This means you, too, fan.
We're rounding third.

01:16:44.201 --> 01:16:46.711
I'm right behind you, Chuck.

01:17:13.230 --> 01:17:18.410
<i>We're coming, we're coming, Leo</i>

01:17:18.568 --> 01:17:22.657
<i>So, Leo, don't despair</i>

01:17:23.156 --> 01:17:28.536
<i>While you are in the cave-in
hoping We are up above you groping</i>

01:17:28.537 --> 01:17:33.088
<i>And we soon will
make an opening, Leo</i>

01:17:34.167 --> 01:17:38.718
<i>We're closer, we're closer, Leo</i>

01:17:39.297 --> 01:17:43.302
<i>And soon you'll breathe fresh air</i>

01:17:43.802 --> 01:17:49.223
<i>While you are in the devil's prison
Keep that spark of life a-fizzing</i>

01:17:49.224 --> 01:17:53.193
<i>We'll soon have you
out of prison, Leo</i>

01:17:53.854 --> 01:17:58.986
<i>Oh, Leo, Leo, Leo, Leo</i>

01:17:59.693 --> 01:18:04.374
<i>Be steadfast and keep
your spirits high</i>

01:18:04.990 --> 01:18:09.043
<i>We're coming, we're coming, Leo</i>

01:18:17.169 --> 01:18:19.128
I want to take this opportunity

01:18:19.129 --> 01:18:21.797
of thanking you people of
the television audience

01:18:21.798 --> 01:18:25.637
for the hundreds of letters and
telegrams that have been pouring in.

01:18:25.761 --> 01:18:29.764
I only wish that I could reach right
out there and shake you by the hand,

01:18:29.765 --> 01:18:31.860
each and every one of you.

01:18:31.975 --> 01:18:34.101
But there's one thing
that I want to make plain

01:18:34.102 --> 01:18:36.979
to you good people of
Los Barrios county.

01:18:36.980 --> 01:18:39.106
When election day rolls around

01:18:39.107 --> 01:18:43.527
I don't want what I'm doing here to
influence your vote one little bit.

01:18:43.528 --> 01:18:48.245
Because all I'm doing here
is my duty as your sheriff.

01:19:40.877 --> 01:19:45.559
<i>We're coming, we're coming, Leo</i>

01:19:46.299 --> 01:19:50.269
<i>Leo, don't despair</i>

01:19:50.387 --> 01:19:56.016
<i>While you are in the cave-in
hoping We are up above you groping</i>

01:19:56.017 --> 01:20:00.900
<i>And we soon will
make an opening, Leo</i>

01:20:01.189 --> 01:20:05.657
<i>We're closer, we're closer, Leo</i>

01:20:06.778 --> 01:20:10.831
<i>And soon you'll breathe fresh air</i>

01:20:10.991 --> 01:20:16.420
<i>While you are in the devil's prison</i>
<i>Keep that spark of life a-fizzing</i>

01:20:17.581 --> 01:20:21.000
<i>We'll soon have you
out of prison, Leo</i>

01:20:21.001 --> 01:20:26.014
<i>Oh, Leo, Leo, Leo, Leo</i>

01:20:26.882 --> 01:20:30.436
<i>Be steadfast and keep
your spirits high</i>

01:20:31.470 --> 01:20:35.392
<i>We're digging, we're digging, Leo</i>

01:20:36.057 --> 01:20:39.695
<i>We've come to set you free</i>

01:20:40.145 --> 01:20:45.277
<i>We can look you in the eye
When you are free beneath the sky</i>

01:20:46.902 --> 01:20:49.697
Hey, how about some more ice here?

01:21:09.841 --> 01:21:12.553
- Yes, Mr Tatum?
- Close that door.

01:21:16.389 --> 01:21:18.974
- What can the management do for you?
- I'll tell you what you can do.

01:21:18.975 --> 01:21:21.644
You can stop playing games
with those newsboys.

01:21:21.645 --> 01:21:23.938
- They're nice fellows.
- They're sharpies.

01:21:23.939 --> 01:21:25.731
They'll rope you into a
game of 20 questions.

01:21:25.732 --> 01:21:29.652
And 20 questions take 20 answers.
And one of them may be the wrong one.

01:21:29.653 --> 01:21:32.780
Don't worry, Mr Tatum. They just
want me to write something for them.

01:21:32.781 --> 01:21:36.668
- Write what?
- My life with Leo, in three parts.

01:21:36.827 --> 01:21:41.259
- I got them up to $750.
- Tell them you can't spell.

01:21:41.456 --> 01:21:43.791
I told them I'm not
interested in their $750.

01:21:43.792 --> 01:21:47.461
And you're not interested in $1,000,
$2,000 or $3,000, understand?

01:21:47.462 --> 01:21:51.173
And I'm not interested in their
three-part story, either.

01:21:51.174 --> 01:21:54.314
It's the fourth part
I'm thinking about.

01:21:54.386 --> 01:21:58.439
After I get out of here, I'm
figuring on going to New York, too.

01:21:58.807 --> 01:22:03.405
Maybe I'll run into you. Maybe
you'll buy me a couple of drinks.

01:22:04.980 --> 01:22:08.149
Maybe you'll even take me
out for a big evening, huh?

01:22:08.150 --> 01:22:09.734
How big?

01:22:10.152 --> 01:22:11.819
You won't be ashamed of me.

01:22:11.820 --> 01:22:14.746
I'm gonna buy me a new
trousseau and look real swell.

01:22:16.867 --> 01:22:20.670
Why don't you wash that
platinum out of your hair?

01:22:30.130 --> 01:22:32.673
<i>This is radio station
KOAT, Albuquerque.</i>

01:22:32.674 --> 01:22:34.258
<i>Bob Bumpas speaking
and bringing you</i>

01:22:34.259 --> 01:22:37.094
<i>our 10:00 p.m. Special events
newscast from Escudero.</i>

01:22:37.095 --> 01:22:39.805
<i>This is the fifth night the
big drill has been pounding</i>

01:22:39.806 --> 01:22:41.432
<i>and grinding its way toward Leo.</i>

01:22:41.433 --> 01:22:44.351
<i>The rescue workers are
now only 26 feet away.</i>

01:22:44.352 --> 01:22:48.272
<i>At the rate they are going, they should
reach Leo by this time tomorrow night.</i>

01:22:48.273 --> 01:22:54.497
<i>So after 129 hours of being buried
alive, at last, freedom seems in sight.</i>

01:22:58.408 --> 01:23:03.873
Now put it on your right side, Leo.
Underneath your arm.

01:23:05.415 --> 01:23:08.637
A little lower. Breathe
through your mouth.

01:23:10.754 --> 01:23:12.967
Move it down a little.

01:23:13.757 --> 01:23:16.759
Breathe. Through your mouth.

01:23:16.760 --> 01:23:19.887
- I can't.
- Don't talk, please. Just breathe.

01:23:19.888 --> 01:23:22.185
Now, on the other side.

01:23:23.975 --> 01:23:27.478
I can't any more.
Get me Father Diego.

01:23:27.479 --> 01:23:29.980
Shut up, Leo. Do what
the doctor tells you.

01:23:29.981 --> 01:23:34.568
Chuck, don't, don't let me
die without the priest.

01:23:34.569 --> 01:23:37.530
You don't need a priest.
You're not going to die.

01:23:37.531 --> 01:23:39.740
Tell him he's not
gonna die, Doctor.

01:23:39.741 --> 01:23:44.870
Everybody's gonna die someday,
Leo. I am. Tatum is. You are.

01:23:44.871 --> 01:23:47.081
But you still have a
long time ahead of you.

01:23:47.082 --> 01:23:51.127
Only you have to help.
Now, put it on the left side.

01:23:51.128 --> 01:23:55.430
Way over. There. Breathe.

01:23:59.136 --> 01:24:01.479
They'll never let me go.

01:24:02.514 --> 01:24:06.100
They're getting even with
me for robbing their tomb.

01:24:06.101 --> 01:24:08.445
They'll never let me go.

01:24:14.651 --> 01:24:16.747
- Pneumonia.
- How bad?

01:24:17.112 --> 01:24:18.779
He told you himself.

01:24:18.780 --> 01:24:21.824
- Nobody dies of pneumonia these days.
- He will.

01:24:21.825 --> 01:24:25.077
You can't lie down here five days and
five nights in the same position.

01:24:25.078 --> 01:24:26.925
What can you do?

01:24:27.164 --> 01:24:30.671
We can get him some oxygen
and help him breathe.

01:24:31.209 --> 01:24:33.335
How long can he hold out?

01:24:33.336 --> 01:24:35.598
Oh, 12 hours.

01:24:35.756 --> 01:24:40.140
Unless we get him in a hospital
tomorrow morning, he'll be dead.

01:24:40.844 --> 01:24:43.686
Chuck. Chuck!

01:24:45.265 --> 01:24:48.356
- Yes, Leo?
- Tell them to stop the drill.

01:24:48.560 --> 01:24:52.146
It's no use. They'll never make it.

01:24:52.147 --> 01:24:55.820
Get those ideas out of your head.
You're talking crazy.

01:24:56.234 --> 01:24:58.444
You'll be out of here
by tomorrow morning.

01:24:58.445 --> 01:25:00.208
No, I won't.

01:25:01.073 --> 01:25:04.331
They'll never reach me
by tomorrow morning.

01:25:04.993 --> 01:25:07.078
I figured it out myself.

01:25:07.079 --> 01:25:10.503
You'll be out of here in
12 hours. Hang on!

01:25:12.209 --> 01:25:15.798
You wouldn't be lying to
me now, would you, Chuck?

01:25:17.130 --> 01:25:19.059
Leo, look at me.

01:25:30.477 --> 01:25:34.399
No, you wouldn't. You never have.

01:25:46.159 --> 01:25:47.459
Here.

01:25:54.126 --> 01:25:57.545
How do you like that dumb snake?
I feed him meat. I feed him cheese.

01:25:57.546 --> 01:26:01.048
I even caught him some bugs.
Won't touch a thing.

01:26:01.049 --> 01:26:04.271
What do you think he goes for?
Chewing gum!

01:26:05.053 --> 01:26:08.109
But only with the
silver wrapper on it.

01:26:10.100 --> 01:26:13.026
Look at him.
He's putting on weight.

01:26:15.730 --> 01:26:19.150
Say, Chuck, I think we ought to get
together about tomorrow night.

01:26:19.151 --> 01:26:22.111
The kid will be out, so let's
make a big thing of it.

01:26:22.112 --> 01:26:24.780
Now, the moment they bring him up,
I wanna shake hands with him.

01:26:24.781 --> 01:26:26.657
But I gotta be the first one.

01:26:26.658 --> 01:26:29.618
Then I wanna make a speech
from the top of the hill.

01:26:29.619 --> 01:26:33.921
I want you to write it for me.
Something nice and simple.

01:26:34.624 --> 01:26:36.921
Hey, what's this?

01:26:41.590 --> 01:26:45.092
What are you sending out here?
What new development?

01:26:45.093 --> 01:26:46.719
What's this all about?

01:26:46.720 --> 01:26:49.096
You read it. We'll have Leo
out by tomorrow morning.

01:26:49.097 --> 01:26:51.390
- We're going the other way.
- What other way?

01:26:51.391 --> 01:26:55.563
The way we could have gone in
the first place, the easy way.

01:26:55.937 --> 01:26:57.646
Now why should we do that?

01:26:57.647 --> 01:26:58.367
Now why should we do that?

01:26:58.648 --> 01:27:02.452
I'll tell you why. Because
the guy in there is dying.

01:27:02.527 --> 01:27:04.403
That's no good for my story.

01:27:04.404 --> 01:27:05.946
When you have a big
human interest story,

01:27:05.947 --> 01:27:08.866
you've got to give it a big
human interest ending.

01:27:08.867 --> 01:27:10.701
When you get people
steamed up like this,

01:27:10.702 --> 01:27:12.995
don't ever make
suckers out of them.

01:27:12.996 --> 01:27:16.504
I don't want to hand them
a dead man. That's why.

01:27:17.459 --> 01:27:20.377
- Well, who says he's gonna be dead?
- I say so.

01:27:20.378 --> 01:27:23.255
Well, maybe he will and maybe he
won't, but I know one thing for sure.

01:27:23.256 --> 01:27:26.342
If we make that switch now,
we got a lot of explaining to do.

01:27:26.343 --> 01:27:28.260
People are gonna wanna
know a lot of things,

01:27:28.261 --> 01:27:30.513
especially them reporter
friends of yours.

01:27:30.514 --> 01:27:33.599
Like, for instance, why did
we have to set up that drill?

01:27:33.600 --> 01:27:36.063
Why did we waste five days?

01:27:36.228 --> 01:27:39.396
First, let's get him out. Then
we'll think of what to tell them.

01:27:39.397 --> 01:27:42.525
Why should we stick out our necks?
Why not stick to the drill?

01:27:42.526 --> 01:27:44.193
We'll speed it up
as much as we can,

01:27:44.194 --> 01:27:46.904
and if we get him while he's
still alive, well, fine.

01:27:46.905 --> 01:27:50.625
If we're too late, well,
we done the best we could.

01:27:51.159 --> 01:27:55.675
It's a better story if we're not
too late. I've sent for Smollett.

01:27:55.831 --> 01:27:59.219
Smollett's my man, and
he's taking my orders.

01:27:59.334 --> 01:28:01.430
Wait a minute, Gus.

01:28:04.256 --> 01:28:05.888
Sit down.

01:28:13.723 --> 01:28:16.892
Now when Smollett comes, you
can give him your orders.

01:28:16.893 --> 01:28:18.644
Tell him to go in through
the cliff dwelling,

01:28:18.645 --> 01:28:21.188
shore it up and get him out fast.

01:28:21.189 --> 01:28:22.857
Not through the cliff dwelling.

01:28:22.858 --> 01:28:26.282
You can't get him out
that way any more.

01:28:28.989 --> 01:28:30.197
Why?

01:28:30.198 --> 01:28:33.451
Because we've been pounding
away with that drill too long.

01:28:33.452 --> 01:28:37.496
They're all shot, those walls.
You can't shore them up now.

01:28:37.497 --> 01:28:41.846
Put a lot of men to work in there,
and they'll cave in on them.

01:28:44.045 --> 01:28:46.005
Don't look at me like that.

01:28:46.006 --> 01:28:48.549
I never wanted to use the
drill in the first place.

01:28:48.550 --> 01:28:52.899
I never wanted to go in on
this at all. You know that.

01:29:23.126 --> 01:29:26.301
I'm sorry, Mr Nagel.
He's not back yet.

01:29:26.379 --> 01:29:28.547
No, I don't know where he is.

01:29:28.548 --> 01:29:32.760
Well, yes, Mr Nagel, I left word
everyplace for him to call New York.

01:29:32.761 --> 01:29:35.262
Yes, I know he has a deadline.

01:29:35.263 --> 01:29:37.765
Well, of course he hasn't
answered the teletype, Mr Nagel.

01:29:37.766 --> 01:29:40.277
He hasn't been in all night.

01:29:40.644 --> 01:29:43.653
Yes, I know how much
you're paying him.

01:29:43.814 --> 01:29:46.988
If Tatum said he's gonna
send more, he'll send more.

01:30:00.539 --> 01:30:03.416
Chuck! Chuck!

01:30:03.917 --> 01:30:06.926
- Where are you, Chuck?
- Here I am, Leo.

01:30:09.756 --> 01:30:11.436
Over here.

01:30:14.261 --> 01:30:16.345
I thought you went away.

01:30:16.346 --> 01:30:19.936
Put that thing back on your
mouth, and take a good long drag.

01:30:20.267 --> 01:30:21.767
It's morning, isn't it?

01:30:21.768 --> 01:30:25.655
- Leo, you have to breathe that oxygen.
- Friday morning.

01:30:27.607 --> 01:30:31.078
Come on. Come on, up there.

01:30:31.653 --> 01:30:35.291
Make all the noise
you want. Hurry up.

01:30:35.866 --> 01:30:37.629
I'm all set.

01:30:38.994 --> 01:30:42.963
I got one leg out already. See it?

01:30:49.212 --> 01:30:51.260
Cut out all that talking, Leo.

01:30:52.924 --> 01:30:54.937
Five years today.

01:30:55.385 --> 01:31:00.067
I hope she hasn't found the present.
I want to give it to her myself.

01:31:01.099 --> 01:31:03.230
I hid it in a good place.

01:31:03.393 --> 01:31:07.316
In the cupboard of our room,
in my old barracks bag.

01:31:07.606 --> 01:31:11.528
She'll never find it there.
I want her to wear it.

01:31:12.069 --> 01:31:14.496
She'll look like a million.

01:31:20.202 --> 01:31:23.079
Why is it so hot in here?
It's so hot.

01:31:23.330 --> 01:31:25.414
'Cause you're talking too much.

01:31:25.415 --> 01:31:28.756
Don't be so dumb, using
up all your strength!

01:31:28.919 --> 01:31:31.512
Breathe that oxygen! Breathe!

01:31:34.674 --> 01:31:37.814
Don't you want to get
your other leg out?

01:31:38.804 --> 01:31:41.777
Yeah, sure. I have to.

01:31:43.975 --> 01:31:47.649
So I can walk down
the hill, walk home,

01:31:49.356 --> 01:31:54.618
walk up the stairs to our room.
So I can give her the present.

01:31:56.405 --> 01:32:02.829
Up the stairs. Up the stairs.
Up the stairs.

01:32:04.079 --> 01:32:05.842
<i>Up the stairs.</i>

01:32:19.261 --> 01:32:21.439
I didn't say come in.

01:32:22.431 --> 01:32:26.020
Now get out, will you, Chuck?
I wanted to surprise you.

01:32:26.059 --> 01:32:29.317
I'm changing my type.
Going light brown again.

01:32:29.729 --> 01:32:34.162
That's the colour it was before
I started fooling around with it.

01:32:36.486 --> 01:32:39.910
I'm cutting it shorter, too.
What do you think?

01:32:43.869 --> 01:32:47.455
Herbie's been looking for you
all night. Where've you been?

01:32:47.456 --> 01:32:49.219
What's that?

01:32:49.916 --> 01:32:51.335
Here.

01:32:52.627 --> 01:32:54.086
What is it?

01:32:54.087 --> 01:32:56.088
- A present.
- For me?

01:32:56.089 --> 01:32:58.931
It's your anniversary, Mrs Minosa.

01:32:59.134 --> 01:33:02.225
- Oh.
- Go on, open it. He wants you to have it.

01:33:08.769 --> 01:33:12.608
Parisian furs. All the
way from Albuquerque.

01:33:15.066 --> 01:33:16.984
Gorgeous, isn't it?

01:33:16.985 --> 01:33:19.695
They must have skinned a
couple of hungry rats.

01:33:19.696 --> 01:33:22.073
- Put it on.
- Honey,

01:33:22.074 --> 01:33:25.498
you wouldn't want me to
wear a thing like this.

01:33:30.332 --> 01:33:33.709
He bought it for you, didn't he?
Now put it on.

01:33:33.710 --> 01:33:37.296
Not me. I got enough money to buy
me a real fur, a silver fox.

01:33:37.297 --> 01:33:39.799
- He wants you to wear it.
- I don't care what...

01:33:39.800 --> 01:33:41.266
I do.

01:33:42.427 --> 01:33:44.637
- I hate it, Chuck!
- Don't take it off.

01:33:44.638 --> 01:33:47.813
- It's like him touching me.
- You know what he said?

01:33:47.974 --> 01:33:50.226
He said you'll look like a million.

01:33:50.227 --> 01:33:52.353
- Let me go, Chuck.
- You know what else he said?

01:33:52.354 --> 01:33:54.772
He said maybe you'll love him now
after what's happened to him.

01:33:54.773 --> 01:33:56.857
Maybe you and he can
start all over again.

01:33:56.858 --> 01:33:59.276
- Let go!
- You're all he talks about.

01:33:59.277 --> 01:34:02.071
- You're all he thinks about.
- Chuck!

01:34:02.072 --> 01:34:05.827
You can buy yourself a dozen silver
foxes, but you're gonna wear this.

01:34:07.244 --> 01:34:10.746
Don't, Chuck! Don't!
I can't breathe!

01:34:10.747 --> 01:34:13.091
He can't breathe, either.

01:34:35.772 --> 01:34:37.654
Now keep it on.

01:37:56.973 --> 01:37:59.767
<i>Hut-Sut Rawlson on the rillerah</i>

01:37:59.768 --> 01:38:02.990
<i>And a brawla, brawla sooit</i>

01:38:03.438 --> 01:38:06.816
<i>Hut-Sut Rawlson on the rillerah</i>

01:38:06.817 --> 01:38:09.610
<i>And a brawla sooit</i>

01:38:09.611 --> 01:38:11.789
Leo.

01:38:12.072 --> 01:38:13.835
Father Diego?

01:38:14.116 --> 01:38:16.792
- Is that you, Father?
- Yes, Leo.

01:38:17.452 --> 01:38:19.500
Is Chuck with you?

01:38:20.455 --> 01:38:22.633
I'm right here, Leo.

01:38:25.210 --> 01:38:29.014
- See that she gets the present, Chuck.
- She's wearing it.

01:38:29.381 --> 01:38:32.805
She is? How does she like it?

01:38:33.385 --> 01:38:35.812
Does she look pretty in it?

01:38:36.930 --> 01:38:38.515
Yes, Leo.

01:38:40.642 --> 01:38:42.441
Thanks, Chuck.

01:38:47.107 --> 01:38:48.692
I'm ready.

01:39:04.499 --> 01:39:07.377
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

01:39:09.796 --> 01:39:11.476
I'm sorry.

01:39:42.287 --> 01:39:43.754
Amen.

01:40:00.180 --> 01:40:03.265
<i>What's holding up those oil drums?</i>

01:40:03.266 --> 01:40:04.650
<i>Send them up!</i>

01:40:36.133 --> 01:40:39.354
Stop the drill. Stop everything.

01:40:47.519 --> 01:40:51.572
<i>Quiet! Quiet, everybody!</i>

01:40:53.650 --> 01:40:56.280
<i>Shut off that music and listen!</i>

01:40:58.155 --> 01:41:01.413
<i>This is Charles Tatum speaking!
Listen to me!</i>

01:41:02.826 --> 01:41:05.586
<i>Listen! Listen!</i>

01:41:13.712 --> 01:41:15.807
<i>Leo Minosa is dead.</i>

01:41:16.631 --> 01:41:22.096
<i>He died a quarter of an hour ago
with the drill just 10 feet away.</i>

01:41:30.771 --> 01:41:35.820
<i>There's nothing we can do any more.
There's nothing anybody can do.</i>

01:41:36.401 --> 01:41:38.781
<i>He's dead. Do you hear me?</i>

01:41:51.041 --> 01:41:53.587
<i>Now go on home, all of you!</i>

01:41:55.796 --> 01:41:57.891
<i>The circus is over.</i>

01:42:04.554 --> 01:42:06.847
Operator, get me Chicago!

01:42:06.848 --> 01:42:09.857
Operator! Operator!
This is a press rush.

01:42:10.227 --> 01:42:14.445
Get me New York. Longacre 57598.

01:44:22.984 --> 01:44:25.614
What are they doing with that?

01:44:26.446 --> 01:44:29.782
They're taking it away.
Orders from New York.

01:44:29.783 --> 01:44:32.159
You never heard anybody
as mad as Nagel.

01:44:32.160 --> 01:44:34.495
I don't get it either, Chuck.
Where were you?

01:44:34.496 --> 01:44:36.956
What's the idea of not
protecting your own paper?

01:44:36.957 --> 01:44:40.381
You had it all for yourself.
You had it first.

01:44:41.044 --> 01:44:44.931
- He told me to tell you you're fired.
- Get me a drink.

01:44:54.307 --> 01:44:57.768
So they moved your piano out, eh?
What are you gonna play on now?

01:44:57.769 --> 01:44:59.645
Had everything sewed
up, didn't you, Tatum?

01:44:59.646 --> 01:45:02.488
Everything but the payoff.
What slipped up?

01:45:02.899 --> 01:45:04.108
Beat it.

01:45:04.109 --> 01:45:06.819
Booze yourself out
of another job, fan?

01:45:06.820 --> 01:45:10.458
The great Tatum.
Better wipe his mouth.

01:45:10.949 --> 01:45:12.961
Beat it. Beat it.

01:45:13.910 --> 01:45:15.661
You heard him. Outside, all of you.

01:45:15.662 --> 01:45:17.204
Where do you go from here, Tatum?

01:45:17.205 --> 01:45:21.083
Maybe the kid can get you a
job on a high school paper.

01:45:21.084 --> 01:45:24.628
Put in a call to New York.
I wanna talk to Nagel.

01:45:24.629 --> 01:45:26.380
Aren't you a little late, Tatum?

01:45:26.381 --> 01:45:31.264
- The papers are on the street now.
- Don't stand there, Herbie. Get Nagel.

01:45:31.928 --> 01:45:35.097
What're you gonna flash to them?
How they weave a Navajo rug?

01:45:35.098 --> 01:45:37.266
That ought to be
worth $1,000 a day.

01:45:37.267 --> 01:45:39.810
Look, Tatum, you were good
to us. We'll be good to you.

01:45:39.811 --> 01:45:42.563
Here's a hot tip. We just
got it from the sheriff.

01:45:42.564 --> 01:45:46.071
He's gonna dig Leo out yet
and give him a big send-off.

01:45:46.443 --> 01:45:48.028
Get out.

01:45:48.195 --> 01:45:49.320
Get out!

01:45:49.321 --> 01:45:51.155
See you in New York when you
pick up that Pulitzer Prize.

01:45:51.156 --> 01:45:52.705
Get out!

01:45:56.953 --> 01:45:59.665
Okay, hold it. Nagel.

01:46:09.174 --> 01:46:11.305
Hello, Nagel? Tatum.

01:46:12.886 --> 01:46:16.191
Wait a minute. Don't yell at me!

01:46:17.015 --> 01:46:19.442
Sure. Sure, I let you down.

01:46:20.102 --> 01:46:23.104
I know they're on the
street, the other papers.

01:46:23.105 --> 01:46:27.566
Sure, sure. Everybody else got
the story. Only it's the wrong story.

01:46:27.567 --> 01:46:29.496
Shut up, I said!

01:46:30.904 --> 01:46:35.336
Leo Minosa didn't die.
He was murdered.

01:46:35.367 --> 01:46:37.660
Is that the best you can think of?

01:46:37.661 --> 01:46:40.579
Stop it, Tatum. You're
wasting your breath.

01:46:40.580 --> 01:46:42.873
Now let me tell you the
story behind the story.

01:46:42.874 --> 01:46:47.753
You got drunk yesterday, you were
drunk all night, and you're still drunk!

01:46:47.754 --> 01:46:49.505
All right, I'm crazy!

01:46:49.506 --> 01:46:51.799
But it's only because I
took a chance on you!

01:46:51.800 --> 01:46:54.885
And I'm giving you your money's
worth, a Tatum special.

01:46:54.886 --> 01:46:57.680
Something that'll make all
the other papers look sick.

01:46:57.681 --> 01:47:00.766
Hey, Nagel, you wouldn't be
sap enough to hang up on me.

01:47:00.767 --> 01:47:02.309
Not now. Listen to this.

01:47:02.310 --> 01:47:05.020
"Reporter keeps man
buried for six days!"

01:47:05.021 --> 01:47:07.273
Now get set for the rest of it.

01:47:07.274 --> 01:47:10.069
Nagel! Nagel! Nagel!

01:47:11.820 --> 01:47:13.405
New York?

01:47:17.200 --> 01:47:21.834
Running a big-city newspaper,
that bald-headed idiot.

01:47:22.539 --> 01:47:24.670
He won't believe me.

01:47:25.834 --> 01:47:28.261
You believe me, don't you?

01:47:30.213 --> 01:47:32.226
Yes, I do, Chuck.

01:47:33.341 --> 01:47:36.135
Now let me help you. I'll take
you to a doctor or a hospital.

01:47:36.136 --> 01:47:38.184
Forget the doctor.

01:47:39.264 --> 01:47:41.223
We've got things to do.

01:47:41.224 --> 01:47:43.934
Like, for instance,
re-elect a sheriff.

01:47:43.935 --> 01:47:46.612
Come on, fan. We got a deadline.

01:48:28.772 --> 01:48:31.863
Come on, Herbie.
You're wasting my time.

01:49:36.089 --> 01:49:40.177
Sit down. That's your desk.

01:49:40.886 --> 01:49:42.684
Now go to work.

01:49:50.771 --> 01:49:55.322
What's the matter with everybody?
Haven't you ever seen me before?

01:49:55.817 --> 01:50:00.415
Go on! It's getting late! Your
paper starts printing in an hour.

01:50:02.074 --> 01:50:08.498
Mr Boot! Boot! Mr Boot!

01:50:12.751 --> 01:50:14.549
Where's Boot?

01:50:20.175 --> 01:50:21.855
Yes, Chuck.

01:50:25.972 --> 01:50:29.895
How'd you like to make yourself
$1,000 a day, Mr Boot?

01:50:30.060 --> 01:50:32.820
I'm $1,000-a-day newspaperman.

01:50:33.563 --> 01:50:36.074
You can have me for nothing.
