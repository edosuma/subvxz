WEBVTT

01:20.440 --> 01:22.920
Shut up, don't move
or I'll shoot you in the face.

01:52.360 --> 01:56.360
THE PREVIOUS DAY

01:57.240 --> 01:59.880
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

02:09.240 --> 02:10.800
Come on, get out.

02:41.960 --> 02:43.400
The Suburra...

02:44.920 --> 02:47.280
This place hasn't changed
in 2,000 years.

02:48.120 --> 02:51.680
Patricians, plebeians,
politicians and criminals,

02:51.760 --> 02:55.480
whores and priests... Rome.

03:02.160 --> 03:03.560
But now the rich live here.

03:03.640 --> 03:05.400
You were right to call me,

03:05.480 --> 03:08.600
Samurai, I want to help you
find your place in this world.

03:09.560 --> 03:11.000
What do you want from me?

03:12.560 --> 03:14.640
The proposal for unifying the land
in Ostia.

03:15.480 --> 03:17.200
I want it to be approved

03:17.280 --> 03:19.800
before the mayor's resignation
comes into effect.

03:21.640 --> 03:23.560
The Ostia land has various owners.

03:23.640 --> 03:26.280
The Church owns the biggest piece.
Who says it'll want to join them?

03:27.080 --> 03:30.640
Final approval requires the signature
of the Commission's technical counselor.

03:30.720 --> 03:32.360
Finucci? Not a problem.

03:32.960 --> 03:35.880
Priests, criminals
and technical counselors...

03:35.960 --> 03:37.960
the cards are already marked.

03:38.040 --> 03:39.920
Know who's missing? You.

03:44.840 --> 03:46.080
What do you want?

03:50.280 --> 03:52.440
You came here without knowing what
to ask for?

03:52.520 --> 03:53.920
I wasn't wrong then.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.280
The fuck you talking about?

03:55.360 --> 03:57.720
You're like a child
who wants to be appreciated,

03:57.800 --> 04:01.080
but who discovers the grownup world
has other rules, other interests.

04:01.160 --> 04:03.520
That's why you're here,
to find out how it works.

04:06.240 --> 04:07.120
Isn't it?

04:25.240 --> 04:26.680
Be quiet.

04:27.320 --> 04:29.360
Now I'll show you a nice little film.

04:33.640 --> 04:35.160
Getting busy, huh?

04:36.640 --> 04:39.000
Think what'd happen if this got around...

04:40.280 --> 04:41.640
Think what'd happen.

04:42.200 --> 04:44.560
I know, you don't want that.

04:45.280 --> 04:48.280
All you gotta do is give me a shitload
of cash,

04:48.960 --> 04:51.640
and I promise you
no one will see this thing.

04:53.640 --> 04:55.160
Now you can talk.

04:57.120 --> 04:58.400
How much?

04:59.840 --> 05:01.480
With 300,000, you can relax.

05:02.840 --> 05:04.960
You don't need to say anything else.

05:05.040 --> 05:07.240
You gotta give it to me this afternoon.

05:14.360 --> 05:15.600
Nine percent...

05:17.200 --> 05:20.280
In three months in the northern zone,
we've lost 9%, Livia.

05:23.440 --> 05:25.280
You want to talk about this later?

05:26.320 --> 05:29.000
Sorry, you were saying?
In the northern zone...?

05:31.080 --> 05:34.160
We've lost a lot of money...
That's your brother's area, right?

05:34.240 --> 05:35.520
"We" who?

05:39.480 --> 05:42.440
I was filling your sister in
on the situation, it's not good.

05:42.520 --> 05:45.120
That's family stuff,
stick to doing the accounts.

05:45.880 --> 05:48.240
The accounts say
you're losing more every month.

05:48.320 --> 05:49.360
Do them again,

05:50.280 --> 05:51.600
maybe you got them wrong.

05:56.520 --> 05:57.400
All right.

05:58.680 --> 06:01.200
-Aureliano, wait, we need to talk.
-I'm busy.

06:01.280 --> 06:02.880
We'll talk some other time.

06:09.920 --> 06:12.200
Listen, don't tell my father about this.

06:12.280 --> 06:15.160
But he'll notice. A kid would notice.

06:15.240 --> 06:17.480
Don't say anything to him,
I'll take care of it.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.560
Actually, let me see.

06:25.320 --> 06:27.880
[in Sinti] [They're going to see
the reception venue.]

06:29.440 --> 06:31.520
[Only a few days to go now.]

06:31.600 --> 06:32.960
[They have to get a move on!]

06:33.040 --> 06:35.240
-[What a wedding it will be!]
-Spadi!

06:35.320 --> 06:38.440
-[The Sale family will be amazed.]
-Spadi!

06:39.640 --> 06:40.680
What do you want?

06:41.360 --> 06:42.760
Where have you been?

06:42.840 --> 06:45.360
The fuck you smiling at?

06:45.440 --> 06:49.680
Your cousin disappeared last night.
He was last seen with Aureliano Adami.

06:50.960 --> 06:53.800
He probably went to blow
all his dough on hookers, as usual.

06:54.440 --> 06:59.480
Maybe, but we've got to find him.
Don't fuck with those scumbags from Ostia.

06:59.560 --> 07:01.000
[Beautiful Angelica!]

07:01.080 --> 07:03.240
Go take care of the reception.
Don't screw up.

07:03.320 --> 07:05.040
[Welcome to our home!]

07:11.080 --> 07:13.720
[Congratulations to the engaged couple!]

07:13.800 --> 07:16.640
[May God bless you!]

07:31.200 --> 07:32.360
Come out.

07:32.800 --> 07:33.960
Let me see.

07:39.480 --> 07:40.760
Well?

07:40.840 --> 07:42.040
It fits you perfectly.

07:43.440 --> 07:46.240
You just need the pants
shortened a bit, it's perfect.

07:47.080 --> 07:49.160
-You think?
-Look at yourself.

07:49.240 --> 07:50.800
Can't you see yourself?

07:52.680 --> 07:53.800
Yeah.

07:54.880 --> 07:58.080
-It just seems a bit pricey, Dad...
-I told you not to worry.

07:58.960 --> 08:00.680
You're about to graduate, my boy,

08:01.320 --> 08:03.880
and your dad's sparing no expense,
end of story.

08:06.040 --> 08:07.400
Answer it.

08:11.320 --> 08:13.200
No, it's the usual cold caller

08:13.280 --> 08:14.840
trying to sell something.

08:15.800 --> 08:18.760
-All right, I'll get it hemmed.
-Good.

08:18.840 --> 08:21.280
I said it was the right one for you.
I'll go pay.

08:30.160 --> 08:31.280
Hello?

08:32.440 --> 08:35.200
Yeah, I've got the money.
I'll bring it to you at six.

08:35.280 --> 08:36.760
Yeah, 20,000.

08:37.240 --> 08:38.280
At six.

08:46.600 --> 08:48.720
He's got a video of me at the party.

08:49.400 --> 08:52.120
-A video?
-If I don't pay, he'll ruin me.

08:52.200 --> 08:55.800
He wants 300,000 euros by four p.m.,
downstairs in the hospital garden.

08:55.880 --> 08:57.600
And what's on this video?

08:58.800 --> 09:00.720
You've brought me into the abyss,

09:01.400 --> 09:03.000
out of self-interest.

09:03.080 --> 09:05.560
Don't say that, Monsignor,
it's not like that.

09:06.240 --> 09:07.800
You're guilty.

09:08.520 --> 09:10.360
Guilty as much as me.

09:10.840 --> 09:12.040
Listen to me,

09:12.600 --> 09:16.320
now we have to sort out this mess
together.

09:17.040 --> 09:20.520
You're a horrible person.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.960
Do you want me to help you or not?

09:26.600 --> 09:28.160
Riccardo, turn it on!

09:51.440 --> 09:53.040
Riccardo, turn it off!

09:55.120 --> 09:57.160
Now I'll show you the shell.

09:57.240 --> 09:58.720
The shell?

09:59.480 --> 10:02.840
We can move the statue from the middle
to make the dance floor.

10:02.920 --> 10:06.440
And when you come in,
you slowly cross the room,

10:06.520 --> 10:08.840
so everyone can admire you.

10:08.920 --> 10:11.960
Then the groom takes her hand
and leads her to your table.

10:12.520 --> 10:13.920
Come on, give her your hand.

10:16.040 --> 10:17.920
Do we need to rehearse
this clown show?

10:18.000 --> 10:21.280
-Yes, give her your hand.
-Okay, where do I take her?

10:21.360 --> 10:23.360
-To your table.
-Let's go.

10:26.920 --> 10:29.040
The Trevi Fountain.

10:29.120 --> 10:30.960
Were you expecting this?

10:31.040 --> 10:32.920
So, you're getting married on Friday.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.600
And we need to decide on the menu.

10:35.160 --> 10:37.080
And we have different types of menus.

10:37.160 --> 10:39.800
Actually, hold on a moment,
I'll go get them.

10:39.880 --> 10:41.000
Okay,

10:41.640 --> 10:43.200
let's choose the menus.

10:52.720 --> 10:54.760
You're really not into this, are you?

10:55.880 --> 10:59.000
No, it's just that I'm not good
at picking food for other people.

10:59.080 --> 11:00.280
What are you good at?

11:02.360 --> 11:03.640
Lots of things,

11:05.200 --> 11:06.680
except being here.

11:07.240 --> 11:08.520
Then let's do one of them.

11:21.720 --> 11:23.560
-Well?
-You've made a huge mess!

11:23.640 --> 11:25.600
-Will you calm down?
-Calm down, my ass!

11:26.200 --> 11:30.040
Someone shot a video of the priest,
and now they're blackmailing him.

11:30.120 --> 11:32.280
-A video?
-Yes, know anything about it?

11:32.360 --> 11:33.840
I only did what you asked me to.

11:33.920 --> 11:38.160
Only? Maybe you were pissed at me
and you found a way to...

11:39.080 --> 11:40.200
Wait, Lele.

11:42.480 --> 11:44.600
Do you really think
I could do that to you?

11:46.120 --> 11:47.280
Really?

11:48.000 --> 11:51.640
But you organized the party,
you picked the people.

11:51.720 --> 11:54.280
And now you've got to help me
fix this mess.

11:56.320 --> 11:59.200
The blackmailer's young,

11:59.280 --> 12:01.520
dark shaved hair, looks like a thug.

12:01.600 --> 12:03.400
Sara, there's a lot of guys like that.

12:03.480 --> 12:05.920
You don't even fucking know
who was at the party?

12:06.000 --> 12:08.400
There's a prostitute in the video,
a black girl.

12:08.480 --> 12:10.680
Do you remember her, at least?

12:10.760 --> 12:12.400
-Yes.
-Who is she?

12:13.000 --> 12:14.560
One of the many.

12:15.440 --> 12:19.120
I want to know who she is, you find her,
because she's involved for sure.

12:20.720 --> 12:23.440
-You still haven't paid me.
-Find the girl!

12:24.720 --> 12:26.000
Find her!

12:35.000 --> 12:36.480
Is this place yours?

12:38.040 --> 12:39.400
It's the family's.

12:39.480 --> 12:41.880
-So it's yours too, right?
-It's the family's.

12:45.920 --> 12:47.720
So, what, you come here to dance?

12:49.360 --> 12:50.360
No.

12:53.360 --> 12:54.800
I come here during the day,

12:55.640 --> 12:57.960
when there's no one here to bother me.

13:02.480 --> 13:04.200
Can we come here to dance sometime?

13:05.040 --> 13:08.400
-Wives stay at home.
-Yeah, maybe 20 years ago.

13:08.480 --> 13:10.960
And anyway,
I'm sure you won't like the music.

13:11.040 --> 13:13.720
Look, I like dancing, like you do.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.520
I gotta go, wait for me here.

13:34.320 --> 13:36.960
What's up? Wow, tough...

13:37.040 --> 13:38.600
Come here.

13:38.680 --> 13:39.960
You're so tough.

13:45.960 --> 13:47.000
Hello?

13:50.040 --> 13:52.720
I knew that shithead priest would talk.

13:53.720 --> 13:54.800
So, who's this woman?

13:55.400 --> 13:58.760
She told me to organize the party,
she's from the "Rome that matters".

13:58.840 --> 14:01.240
Like I give a fuck
about the "Rome that matters".

14:01.320 --> 14:03.520
Anyway, she wants me
to find the black girl.

14:03.600 --> 14:05.800
She saw us, it could be a problem.

14:05.880 --> 14:08.000
It's no problem.
I'll take care of the hooker,

14:08.080 --> 14:10.600
but the priest needs to know
we're not playing.

14:10.680 --> 14:13.240
Put the video online,
not all of it, just enough,

14:13.320 --> 14:15.520
without showing his face,
just to scare him.

14:15.600 --> 14:17.920
When did you become the boss?

14:19.240 --> 14:20.840
An Anacleti can't be in charge.

14:20.920 --> 14:23.120
I couldn't give a fuck
about being in charge,

14:23.200 --> 14:25.040
but I don't want to take orders.

14:25.120 --> 14:27.160
So, this time let's do without bosses.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.400
We found the only gypsy
who knows how to think!

14:41.240 --> 14:43.720
You, come with me.
Let's see if you can think, too.

14:58.080 --> 15:00.320
Listen, I don't like being jerked around.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.240
What does that mean?

15:03.960 --> 15:06.840
That you're a friend of that woman
from the Rome that matters.

15:07.760 --> 15:09.440
And you're also a cop's son.

15:10.600 --> 15:12.680
What do you know about my father?

15:12.760 --> 15:15.800
You think I work with someone
without knowing who they are?

15:17.240 --> 15:19.320
One thing's me, my father's another.

15:22.240 --> 15:23.280
We'll see.

15:37.520 --> 15:40.920
Your fiancée left. She was pissed.

15:41.000 --> 15:42.120
Yeah...

15:42.880 --> 15:44.760
Whatever. Women, they get over it.

16:04.760 --> 16:06.120
Does she live there?

16:06.800 --> 16:08.000
Yeah, she lives there.

16:09.120 --> 16:11.880
-But I don't know which apartment.
-Okay, let's go.

16:20.800 --> 16:22.960
-Is it this one?
-I think so.

16:24.240 --> 16:26.080
Great, now which fucking one is it?

16:30.200 --> 16:32.600
-Excuse me, you know which one is...
-Isabel's.

16:32.680 --> 16:34.480
You looking for Isabel, guys?

16:35.160 --> 16:38.160
-Why don't you come up to me first?
-Tell me where she lives.

16:38.240 --> 16:40.600
All right, first floor, apartment three.

16:41.520 --> 16:42.680
Thanks.

16:47.760 --> 16:49.040
Close the door.

16:53.120 --> 16:54.920
What are you doing with that?

16:55.000 --> 16:57.120
Me, nothing,
you're going to kill the bitch.

16:58.880 --> 17:00.880
No way, I'm not killing anyone.

17:01.600 --> 17:03.040
You wanna call Daddy?

17:03.800 --> 17:06.640
Wanna ask him what you'd get
for drug dealing and blackmail?

17:06.720 --> 17:08.480
There's gotta be another way, right?

17:08.560 --> 17:10.800
She's seen our faces,
there's no other way.

17:16.319 --> 17:18.480
Is this how you want
to be a criminal, Lele?

17:22.079 --> 17:23.880
Stay here, keep your eyes peeled,

17:25.240 --> 17:27.400
so if I get a murder rap,
you're my accomplice.

17:29.480 --> 17:31.240
You better be here when I get back.

17:31.320 --> 17:34.200
If you're not, I'll come find you,
and you'll be in deep shit.

18:57.640 --> 18:59.120
What the fuck are you doing?

19:02.480 --> 19:05.760
I won't say anything...
I won't say anything, I promise.

19:05.840 --> 19:08.520
-Come here.
-I promise I won't say anything.

19:08.600 --> 19:10.800
-I said, come here.
-Please, let go of me.

19:10.880 --> 19:12.040
Shut up!

19:12.120 --> 19:14.240
I won't say anything, please...

19:15.280 --> 19:16.440
Please!

19:17.040 --> 19:18.160
Help!

19:20.200 --> 19:21.920
I promise I won't say anything.

19:51.280 --> 19:52.600
I took care of it. Let's go.

19:57.720 --> 20:01.600
Don't you understand they uploaded
some video of the priest at the party?

20:01.680 --> 20:03.040
And the girl?

20:04.320 --> 20:05.680
What does that mean?

20:05.760 --> 20:09.280
That she's nowhere to be found,
she's gone, that's what.

20:09.360 --> 20:12.560
You find her, got it?
You've got to find her!

20:16.560 --> 20:17.920
They put the video online,

20:18.480 --> 20:20.600
for now,
without showing Theodosiou's face,

20:20.680 --> 20:22.680
but if he doesn't pay,
they'll post it all.

20:22.760 --> 20:24.560
You want to put our lives in his hands?

20:24.640 --> 20:26.960
-He may be involved in the blackmail.
-He's not!

20:27.040 --> 20:29.560
How the fuck can you trust him?

20:30.000 --> 20:32.200
Do you have any other solutions?
Do you?

20:56.400 --> 20:57.760
-Well?
-Well, what?

20:57.840 --> 21:00.560
-The agenda?
-It's already set.

21:00.640 --> 21:04.080
Yes, but with the mayor resigning,
maybe it needs reviewing.

21:04.160 --> 21:06.760
There are matters that take precedence.

21:06.840 --> 21:09.680
Sure, everyone's in a hurry
to get their business through now.

21:09.760 --> 21:12.080
Everyone, who? Look, all we're asking you

21:12.160 --> 21:15.080
is to reflect on the political emergency
facing Rome.

21:15.160 --> 21:17.120
Since when do you care about politics?

21:17.200 --> 21:20.840
What's with the tone?
I happen to be a councilman like you,

21:20.920 --> 21:23.520
elected by the citizens of Rome,
exactly like you.

21:30.280 --> 21:31.840
Where the fuck's he going now?

21:34.880 --> 21:36.320
Have you seen Finucci?

21:37.320 --> 21:39.160
I just saw him pass by.

21:47.480 --> 21:48.800
Chairman.

21:52.360 --> 21:54.000
How much is he paying you?

21:54.080 --> 21:55.280
Pardon me?

21:56.760 --> 21:58.560
Samurai, how much is he paying you?

22:03.880 --> 22:07.600
-Well?
-You want to know how much to ask?

22:09.040 --> 22:11.640
And are the other councilmen
on his payroll too?

22:11.720 --> 22:14.840
Not that I know of,
at least not on this deal.

22:15.400 --> 22:17.080
On this deal, you and I are enough.

22:19.600 --> 22:20.800
I could leak it,

22:22.120 --> 22:23.800
cause a scandal.

22:24.400 --> 22:25.800
You already would have.

22:27.200 --> 22:29.960
When you're done struggling
with your conscience,

22:30.040 --> 22:33.160
call the commission
and ask for an amendment to the agenda.

22:33.760 --> 22:37.160
And you'll ask for the Ostia proposal
to be discussed first up,

22:37.240 --> 22:41.160
I'll oppose it, but my opinion
will only be a technical one.

22:43.080 --> 22:46.640
That will stay in the minutes,
so you'll have an alibi.

22:48.760 --> 22:50.240
Ostia's a strange business.

22:50.960 --> 22:54.040
Take my advice,
make sure you get paid well.

23:09.880 --> 23:13.640
There's not much time left,
so listen to me.

23:14.960 --> 23:17.920
I'll go to the appointment in your place
and sort it all out.

23:18.000 --> 23:21.640
I want you to leave here
and come to the commission at eight,

23:21.720 --> 23:24.400
where you'll get everybody
to vote the way we agreed.

23:25.960 --> 23:26.960
All right?

23:28.000 --> 23:29.920
You're no different from those people.

23:31.960 --> 23:33.440
I'll see you at eight.

23:36.720 --> 23:38.360
What's the family's share?

23:38.440 --> 23:40.880
No share, this is a huge deal,

23:40.960 --> 23:43.960
it concerns the land you can see
and everything around it.

23:44.040 --> 23:47.760
They'll build a port and my family
will have part of the coke that comes in.

23:48.240 --> 23:49.560
Tons of coke.

23:50.640 --> 23:52.600
And your brother doesn't know anything?

23:52.680 --> 23:54.840
No, my father doesn't
want to tell him yet.

24:04.560 --> 24:07.120
And to think Aureliano wanted
to open a club here.

24:08.440 --> 24:10.680
That's a lousy idea,
you guys have tons of clubs.

24:10.760 --> 24:12.880
Don't get caught up in the middle of this.

24:14.280 --> 24:16.760
I'm not in the middle.
I'm totally on your side.

24:17.840 --> 24:19.520
Maybe a bit too much.

24:20.880 --> 24:21.920
Is that bad?

24:26.320 --> 24:27.200
What?

24:32.400 --> 24:33.360
Sorry.

24:33.960 --> 24:36.040
-We can't.
-Why?

24:37.240 --> 24:38.400
Because we can't.

24:42.160 --> 24:43.680
And this?

24:46.600 --> 24:47.560
Don't get too close.

24:48.440 --> 24:49.520
He's tied up.

24:50.120 --> 24:51.360
No, don't get too close.

24:53.120 --> 24:54.160
Little pup...

24:55.440 --> 24:56.560
Hello.

25:04.760 --> 25:05.800
Boris?

25:05.880 --> 25:09.840
[We found his car totaled,
but there's no trace of him or his dog.]

25:11.480 --> 25:12.920
[Search everywhere.]

25:15.760 --> 25:17.600
[I wanna know what happened to him.]

25:39.880 --> 25:41.480
There are no cops.

25:42.600 --> 25:44.840
I told you, Friar Fuck got scared.

25:45.840 --> 25:47.800
Now you'll see how he rolls over.

25:49.840 --> 25:51.560
Yo, what's with you?

25:52.040 --> 25:55.000
-You've been quiet for an hour.
-Must be indigestion.

25:56.640 --> 25:57.760
Look, it's time.

25:58.520 --> 26:00.240
You're in a hurry to see the money?

26:00.320 --> 26:02.040
I'm in a hurry for this to be over.

26:03.960 --> 26:05.600
I'll be watching you.

26:06.840 --> 26:08.720
Scared I'm gonna steal your money?

26:09.440 --> 26:11.240
You're still a gypsy...

26:21.560 --> 26:24.440
I don't get you guys.
It's all a game for you.

26:28.320 --> 26:30.560
It's better to have fun
when you work, bro.

26:44.200 --> 26:45.480
Who the fuck's she?

26:48.400 --> 26:49.400
Do you know her?

26:49.480 --> 26:51.280
It's Sara. She asked for the party.

26:52.200 --> 26:53.840
Where's the priest?

27:12.600 --> 27:14.320
What's this, a joke?

27:14.400 --> 27:17.720
It's not even a tenth.
Let's say it's an advance.

27:17.800 --> 27:19.360
No, let's say it's all of it.

27:20.160 --> 27:22.240
Anyway, it's all the priest's got.

27:22.840 --> 27:25.040
Lady, now you go to that asshole

27:25.120 --> 27:28.440
and tell him if I don't get all the money,
his face ends up all over the place.

27:28.520 --> 27:30.400
That clear, or should I write it down?

27:30.480 --> 27:33.520
Put it online and the police
will trace you in five minutes.

27:39.880 --> 27:42.880
-This doesn't end here.
-I say it does.

28:04.000 --> 28:05.240
What's this mean?

28:06.320 --> 28:09.240
It's what she gave me,
she says it's all the priest's got.

28:18.000 --> 28:19.440
Where the fuck's he going?

29:15.600 --> 29:16.680
Where is he?

29:22.720 --> 29:24.640
Sister, where the fuck is the priest?

29:25.560 --> 29:28.840
-Where the fuck is he?
-He left an hour ago.

29:38.160 --> 29:40.520
Here, thank your friend, asshole.

29:41.520 --> 29:43.120
We still have the video, right?

29:45.480 --> 29:47.240
Then maybe you don't get it,

29:47.320 --> 29:49.480
the priest's gone,
we don't know where he is,

29:49.560 --> 29:51.240
you can stick the video up your ass.

29:51.320 --> 29:53.400
Actually, upload the whole fucking thing,

29:53.480 --> 29:55.720
at least it'll turn the priest
off fucking.

30:14.240 --> 30:16.160
What the fuck do I do with only this?

30:21.160 --> 30:22.320
I'm fucked!

30:40.360 --> 30:41.720
Not bad, this kid.

30:51.680 --> 30:54.680
You remember the day you stopped
dreaming of being a champion?

30:55.880 --> 30:57.320
I didn't play soccer.

31:00.880 --> 31:02.720
I'll have the agenda amended.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.720
I'll fix it so the Ostia business
is discussed first.

31:06.800 --> 31:09.960
-That's all I'll do, let that be clear.
-That's all I want.

31:10.800 --> 31:11.800
The price?

31:12.840 --> 31:15.000
You'll pay for my election campaign.

31:16.720 --> 31:18.640
I want to be at the top of the ticket.

31:21.920 --> 31:26.440
Do what I asked...
You'll see, I'll be very generous.

31:27.320 --> 31:29.040
Who's the Ostia land going to?

31:30.160 --> 31:33.240
Be careful,
you might come to like this game.

31:36.160 --> 31:37.120
Take care.

31:58.080 --> 32:00.040
What the fuck's this?

32:00.720 --> 32:02.200
-How much is it?
-Ten grand.

32:02.280 --> 32:04.400
Ten grand? How much did I tell you?

32:05.160 --> 32:07.160
-Twenty...
-Twenty, I said.

32:07.240 --> 32:09.280
I swear, I'll bring it tomorrow.

32:10.600 --> 32:12.760
Bring me the rest,
same time tomorrow,

32:12.840 --> 32:15.760
plus another 20 grand
for the trouble, got it?

32:35.000 --> 32:36.240
You okay, kid?

32:39.680 --> 32:40.680
Fine.

32:47.680 --> 32:49.000
Who the fuck's that?

32:49.080 --> 32:51.080
One of the many who gotta pay us.

33:05.160 --> 33:06.560
Hi, Romolo.

33:06.640 --> 33:08.200
Your sister's looking for you.

33:08.280 --> 33:09.880
-Where is she?
-On the terrace.

33:19.200 --> 33:20.520
I went to the kiosk.

33:22.440 --> 33:23.560
How come?

33:24.720 --> 33:26.160
Did Dad change his mind?

33:27.200 --> 33:28.200
Whose dog is it?

33:28.280 --> 33:31.320
Mine, I found him on the street.
What did you want to tell me?

33:32.120 --> 33:33.360
Dad's right.

33:34.160 --> 33:36.640
The kiosk's not worth it.
It's too expensive.

33:38.200 --> 33:39.680
Says who? Quirino?

33:41.240 --> 33:43.760
He needs to stick to the accounts,
I already told you.

33:43.840 --> 33:46.600
-He does them well.
-Something else he'd like to do well.

33:49.560 --> 33:51.480
I had to send Romolo out
to do your work,

33:51.560 --> 33:54.120
Dad doesn't notice,
but you gotta take care of it.

33:57.520 --> 34:00.080
You can't always think
only about money, Livia.

34:00.160 --> 34:02.720
I think about covering up
your fuck-ups too.

34:02.800 --> 34:04.840
And of keeping the family together.

34:08.239 --> 34:09.840
But what do you think about?

34:12.440 --> 34:14.760
Why didn't we ever have a dog?

34:19.400 --> 34:21.400
Why didn't we ever have a dog?

34:22.560 --> 34:24.840
Dad didn't like them. Mom did.

34:24.920 --> 34:26.159
Weird...

34:28.239 --> 34:30.280
You're getting to be
more and more like Mom.

34:36.440 --> 34:38.400
Anyway, the dog's adorable,

34:38.480 --> 34:40.920
bring him home, we'll piss off Dad.

35:05.920 --> 35:09.120
-What the fuck are you doing?
-You left me there like an idiot.

35:09.200 --> 35:11.040
I had a shitty day, all right?

35:11.120 --> 35:13.680
I won't let anyone treat me like that,
you hear me?

35:14.480 --> 35:16.080
Stay away from me.

35:16.760 --> 35:19.280
-Go fuck yourself.
-Fuck you.

35:21.200 --> 35:22.800
Where are you off to?

35:27.720 --> 35:29.360
Listen here, you...

35:32.680 --> 35:33.560
What happened?

35:34.840 --> 35:36.720
Nothing. Anyway, it's my business.

35:37.680 --> 35:40.760
No one has their own fucking business
in this house,

35:40.840 --> 35:42.440
don't forget it.

36:08.200 --> 36:10.080
Nothing's changed here, you know.

36:10.720 --> 36:13.280
I haven't been here
for three months, either.

36:16.600 --> 36:19.040
I've got to go to the Vatican.
I'm in a hurry...

36:19.920 --> 36:21.480
What did you want to tell me?

36:22.200 --> 36:24.120
The girl... I haven't found her.

36:24.200 --> 36:27.200
It doesn't matter. I took care of it.

36:27.800 --> 36:28.680
How?

36:29.120 --> 36:30.400
I paid.

36:31.080 --> 36:32.680
Not what they asked for.

36:41.600 --> 36:43.320
Is the priest still in the hospital?

36:44.000 --> 36:46.040
No, they discharged him.

36:46.120 --> 36:47.640
So, he's already back home?

36:48.240 --> 36:49.960
-Is he okay?
-Yeah, he's recovered.

36:50.040 --> 36:51.280
Enough.

36:53.600 --> 36:55.840
I'm seeing him in an hour
at the commission.

36:58.160 --> 37:01.080
I've still got to pay you.

37:03.200 --> 37:04.720
I haven't forgotten.

37:09.960 --> 37:11.560
You're so beautiful.

37:16.720 --> 37:19.120
Listen, I'm sorry about this morning.

37:19.200 --> 37:20.280
Forget it.

37:29.480 --> 37:31.120
Close the door behind you.

37:31.880 --> 37:32.840
Bye.

37:42.880 --> 37:44.360
You put the video online yet?

37:45.800 --> 37:46.960
Well, don't do it.

37:47.840 --> 37:49.200
I know where the priest is.

37:59.600 --> 38:02.080
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

38:02.160 --> 38:06.000
Good evening, Your Eminence,
the monsignor is on his way.

38:29.920 --> 38:30.800
Friar Fuck...

38:34.560 --> 38:37.880
-Wow, you're in good shape.
-Our buddy here recovered quickly.

38:37.960 --> 38:39.560
Where are you going? Come here.

38:42.160 --> 38:43.640
We just wanna talk with you.

38:44.880 --> 38:46.080
You don't wanna talk?

38:49.960 --> 38:51.400
Let's go around the block.

39:29.040 --> 39:31.240
Monsignor, do you need help?

39:32.080 --> 39:33.480
Valeria,

39:33.560 --> 39:36.800
I need to make a very private phone call.

40:05.600 --> 40:07.120
Excuse me a moment.

40:07.680 --> 40:08.560
Hello?

40:09.160 --> 40:11.760
They're back, do you hear me?
They're back.

40:12.160 --> 40:15.720
-They were outside the commission.
-Where are you now?

40:15.800 --> 40:17.720
At the dry cleaner's near my house.

40:19.040 --> 40:21.760
-Did they see you go in?
-I don't think so.

40:22.200 --> 40:23.480
I can't stay here.

40:23.560 --> 40:26.240
Now listen to me, calm down.

40:26.760 --> 40:30.320
You need to go home now,
lock the door and don't open for anyone.

40:56.200 --> 40:58.120
Monsignor Theodosiou apologizes,

40:58.200 --> 41:00.720
but something's come up
and the meeting's postponed.

41:00.800 --> 41:02.640
I hope it's nothing serious.

41:02.720 --> 41:04.640
Nothing that can't be solved.

41:04.720 --> 41:06.120
Let's hope so.

41:20.840 --> 41:21.720
Yeah?

41:21.800 --> 41:24.760
I found him, come back.

42:13.360 --> 42:15.920
Shut up, don't move
or I'll shoot you in the face.

42:25.680 --> 42:28.280
I don't think you've repented enough,
Friar Fuck.

42:29.440 --> 42:31.000
Go on, keep going.

42:33.440 --> 42:34.400
Go on.

42:39.400 --> 42:40.800
How much you got in the bank?

42:42.280 --> 42:44.480
I asked you how much you got
in the bank.

42:45.400 --> 42:47.640
-Fifteen, 20,000 euros...
-Don't bullshit me.

42:49.000 --> 42:50.720
You're the head of the commission,

42:50.800 --> 42:53.280
so you can go to the bank
and ask for money, right?

42:58.400 --> 43:00.240
Can you ask for the 300,000?

43:02.320 --> 43:03.440
Yes.

43:11.400 --> 43:14.560
You're coming with us,
so you don't fuck anything else up.

43:16.040 --> 43:19.040
In the morning, send someone
to get the money, give it to us

43:19.680 --> 43:21.280
and we'll forget all about you.

43:22.920 --> 43:23.800
Got it?

44:19.840 --> 44:21.320
Down the end, to the right.

44:28.440 --> 44:29.520
Come here.

44:40.360 --> 44:41.680
Don't fuck up, Friar Fuck.

45:06.040 --> 45:07.360
Monsignor?

45:09.280 --> 45:10.480
Monsignor?

45:20.320 --> 45:21.760
Monsignor?

45:23.880 --> 45:25.280
You're sure it's safe here?

45:25.960 --> 45:29.600
Don't worry, even if he yells,
no one can hear him.

45:33.040 --> 45:35.080
This music rocks!

45:37.560 --> 45:39.440
What are you doing, Lele?

45:39.520 --> 45:42.120
-You're not dancing?
-Cut it out.

45:42.200 --> 45:43.760
How come you're not dancing?

45:44.760 --> 45:46.800
Doesn't he make you wanna dance? Look.

45:52.000 --> 45:53.240
Wanna make a toast?

45:54.560 --> 45:56.400
Next time, I got stuff to do.

45:57.240 --> 45:58.600
See you tomorrow.

46:00.800 --> 46:02.360
Go on, get a couple of glasses.

47:09.080 --> 47:10.080
Manfredi.

47:11.600 --> 47:13.120
They found Boris,

47:14.880 --> 47:16.720
under a viaduct in Eur.

47:17.720 --> 47:20.760
He says you can't even recognize him,
he was bashed to a pulp.

47:48.440 --> 47:49.840
Why are you a hooker?

47:51.840 --> 47:54.440
First you don't shoot me,
then you come back...

47:54.520 --> 47:55.400
What do you want?

47:58.000 --> 47:59.720
I want to know where you were born.

48:00.960 --> 48:01.920
I'm from Rome.

48:15.800 --> 48:16.760
Okay.

48:21.160 --> 48:23.080
If you don't wanna talk to me, I'll go.

48:47.760 --> 48:49.560
