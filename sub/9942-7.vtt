WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:05.993
Now nobody's saying the Chatsworth Estate
is the Garden of Eden,

00:06.040 --> 00:08.315
but it's been a good home to us, to me,

00:08.360 --> 00:13.150
Frank Gallagher, and me kids who
l'm proud of, cos every single one of 'em

00:13.200 --> 00:16.158
reminds me a little of me.

00:16.200 --> 00:21.877
They can all think for themselves,
which they've got me to thank for.

00:21.920 --> 00:25.549
Lip, who's a bit of a gobshite, which is why
nobody calls him Phillip any more.

00:25.600 --> 00:29.912
lan, a lot like his mam, which is handy for
the others cos she's disappeared into thin air.

00:29.960 --> 00:34.192
And Carl. We daren't let him
grow his hair for two reasons -

00:34.240 --> 00:37.755
it makes it stand on end and makes him
look like Toyah, and nits love him.

00:37.800 --> 00:40.872
Debbie - sent by God, total angel.

00:40.920 --> 00:43.912
You've to check your change
but she'll go miles out of her way

00:43.960 --> 00:45.632
to do you a favour,

00:45.680 --> 00:48.399
plus lickle Liam,
who's gonna be a star some day.

00:48.440 --> 00:54.072
Sheila, me bird, couldn't be happier.
One plate short of a full set, like.

00:54.120 --> 00:57.271
And fantastic neighbours Kev
and Veronica - lend ya anything,

00:57.320 --> 00:58.673
well, almost anything.

00:58.720 --> 01:03.350
Carol and Marty - the lodgers from hell.
Last of the lonely hearts

01:03.400 --> 01:06.472
and a psychologist's wet dream.
Still, nobody's perfect.

01:06.520 --> 01:10.877
But all of 'em to a man
know first and foremost

01:10.920 --> 01:16.472
one of the most vital necessities in life
is they know how to throw a party!

01:16.520 --> 01:17.748
Heh, heh, heh, scatter!

01:18.520 --> 01:22.399
(Debbie) 'ln social studies, we learnt
that when families first started,

01:22.440 --> 01:25.079
'it was because we were primitive
hunter-gatherers who needed

01:25.120 --> 01:28.157
the family unit to protect the
weaker, younger members.

01:28.200 --> 01:31.112
'That way, they could survive and become
the next lot of hunter-gatherers.'

01:31.160 --> 01:31.831
State of her!

01:33.800 --> 01:37.475
Carl, get her next door, now! Now!

01:38.840 --> 01:43.311
Sorry, Carol, but l did make it
clear it was guest list only.

01:43.360 --> 01:45.749
Must be something l've eaten.

01:45.800 --> 01:48.314
Come here, Carol. Come on.

01:52.600 --> 01:54.477
Concentrate.

01:54.520 --> 01:57.353
Cheeky vimto. What you on about?

01:57.400 --> 02:00.073
lt's got vodka in it, Carol.

02:00.120 --> 02:04.272
l told Debbie straight off.
No spirits, no class A's.

02:08.919 --> 02:10.353
Fuck me.

02:10.400 --> 02:12.595
Looks like a party.

02:12.640 --> 02:15.598
(Debbie) 'They reckon that
since the industrial revolution,

02:15.640 --> 02:18.393
'the modern family
has developed into a different unit.

02:18.440 --> 02:22.592
'Now its main role is the emotional
and moral welfare of the young.

02:22.640 --> 02:24.949
'What's that about?
l mean, as long as there isn't

02:25.000 --> 02:29.198
'a woolly mammoth biting my arse,
l can look after myself, ta very much.'

02:32.640 --> 02:35.712
lf you fancy a bit of chill-out
space, you can come next door.

02:35.760 --> 02:38.194
- Oi! Out!
- lt's much quieter.

02:38.240 --> 02:40.754
Lip, you promised!

02:45.120 --> 02:47.350
You know that were Nicola?

02:47.400 --> 02:48.879
Yeah.

02:50.720 --> 02:52.472
What, in Debbie's class?

02:52.520 --> 02:54.033
Yeah.

02:54.080 --> 02:57.959
Christ. Arse on her, though.

03:04.360 --> 03:06.590
What do you think?

03:06.640 --> 03:08.119
Fantastic.

03:08.160 --> 03:09.912
l wasn't sure about the material.

03:09.960 --> 03:12.076
lt's always a bit iffy
from the catalogue.

03:12.120 --> 03:14.111
You just can't tell looking at it.

03:14.160 --> 03:16.355
You're gorgeous. Fuck your brains out!

03:16.400 --> 03:19.358
Yeah, but you don't think
the straps are a bit funny?

03:19.400 --> 03:21.197
See what l mean?

03:21.240 --> 03:23.435
All right, which colour do you like?

03:27.160 --> 03:28.718
That one.

03:28.760 --> 03:31.832
l always think cream washes me out.

03:31.880 --> 03:33.916
Oh, l got a top an' all.

03:33.960 --> 03:36.599
Sue, l don't give a fuck.
Just come here, will yer?

03:38.000 --> 03:44.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:45.080 --> 03:46.274
What the fuck's that?

03:46.320 --> 03:48.311
Don't think so. Everybody out.

03:48.360 --> 03:51.238
Shut up and get out!

03:51.280 --> 03:53.714
That's it. Come on.

03:53.760 --> 03:56.593
You trying to turn
the place into a shag pit?

03:56.640 --> 03:59.029
lt's nothing to do with me!
Must've had a power cut.

03:59.080 --> 04:00.274
Nice try, Debs.

04:00.320 --> 04:01.799
Lip! lt's not even midnight!

04:01.840 --> 04:03.398
Come on, keep moving.

04:03.440 --> 04:06.796
Come on. That's it.

04:12.040 --> 04:13.792
Where's Liam?

04:13.840 --> 04:16.752
Party? He stayed the night
at Kev and Veronica's, duh!

04:16.800 --> 04:19.951
No, l mean, aren't you
taking him to school?

04:21.600 --> 04:25.036
You can do it. One night, l ask for
some consideration,

04:25.080 --> 04:30.108
l ask for the place to myself, no
interference, but you treat me like a little kid.

04:30.160 --> 04:32.958
Well, if l'm a little kid,
l'll start acting like one.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.958
And little kids can't look
after their little brothers.

04:37.120 --> 04:39.634
Leccy's gone, you div.

04:40.920 --> 04:41.830
Debbie!

05:03.520 --> 05:08.071
Kettle's bust. And l've got
a mouth like a goat's lavatory.

05:08.120 --> 05:10.918
Carol. Give me a heart attack.

05:10.960 --> 05:14.475
lt's the leccy. Went off last night.
None in the Gallaghers, either.

05:14.520 --> 05:17.512
For you.
Just junk mail by the look of it.

05:23.320 --> 05:25.197
They've come!

05:29.720 --> 05:32.871
Fucking hell.
Tonight Matthew, l'm Myra Hindley.

05:32.920 --> 05:34.672
Fuck off.

05:34.720 --> 05:37.553
Least l don't look
like Ken fucking Dodd.

05:37.600 --> 05:40.592
Hey. Cyprus, eh?

05:41.640 --> 05:46.077
Sex on the beach. Mile High Club.

05:46.120 --> 05:47.997
You dirty bitch.

05:48.040 --> 05:50.235
ls it really a mile up?

05:50.280 --> 05:51.349
How d'you mean?

05:51.400 --> 05:54.995
Well, up in the sky,
is it a mile up, like?

05:55.040 --> 05:57.395
l don't know, do l?
l mean it must be,

05:57.440 --> 05:59.396
if that's what they call it.

06:03.200 --> 06:05.839
Oh, no, no Veronica, Veronica.
Not with Liam here.

06:05.880 --> 06:08.792
l feel a bit weird.

06:08.840 --> 06:11.479
He's asleep.
l've checked on him. Come on.

06:11.520 --> 06:14.353
No. 'Ere y'are.
Look, look, l need a wazz anyway.

06:16.160 --> 06:18.230
Veronica,
Have you not got any butter?

06:18.280 --> 06:21.113
l can only find that
diet spread stuff.

06:21.160 --> 06:23.310
For fuck's sake.

06:36.080 --> 06:37.798
Hiya, babe.

06:37.840 --> 06:39.398
Hiya.

07:00.520 --> 07:02.476
Another dead soldier.

07:02.520 --> 07:06.274
No more until he's paid.
Your tab's frozen, Frank.

07:06.320 --> 07:07.992
You're on pay as you go.

07:08.040 --> 07:11.555
''Your tab's frozen. No more tab.''
Thank you, Nat fucking West.

07:14.880 --> 07:15.869
MOUTHS

07:15.920 --> 07:18.514
No, sorry. Got holiday coming up.

07:18.560 --> 07:21.154
Need all my spare change
for spending money.

07:21.200 --> 07:23.873
Oh. Thatcher's children, Kevin.

07:23.920 --> 07:28.516
Always wanting more,
surrounding ourselves with things.

07:28.560 --> 07:32.553
Yeah, well, me and V haven't been
away in nearly six years, so...

07:32.600 --> 07:34.033
lnstant gratification.

07:34.080 --> 07:37.117
Sheila's the same.
''lt's for the wedding Frank.

07:37.160 --> 07:39.594
''You know we're on a tight budget.''
Tenner to last me a fucking week.

07:39.640 --> 07:41.596
Tommy!

07:47.160 --> 07:48.388
Lovely.

07:48.440 --> 07:52.399
Smoke alarms. Council has
to fit 'em all as standard now.

07:52.440 --> 07:56.479
They pay a fortune
for kite marks and all that shit.

07:56.520 --> 07:57.999
Fucking tax-payer's money isn't it?

07:58.040 --> 08:00.395
They bear no responsibility,
these people.

08:00.440 --> 08:02.908
Got it in one, Frank.

08:04.560 --> 08:09.839
So me and Phil, we pick up a load of
Korean units for next to nowt, right?

08:09.880 --> 08:14.715
Then we install them and flog
the pricey ones up in Chorlton.

08:14.760 --> 08:16.318
Nice little earner.

08:16.360 --> 08:18.351
FRANK CHUCKLES

08:18.400 --> 08:20.152
Here we go.

08:20.200 --> 08:22.270
You on vitamins, or what?

08:22.320 --> 08:23.912
Another nice little earner.

08:23.960 --> 08:27.077
Drug trials. l get £200 quid
for taking these for three weeks.

08:27.120 --> 08:31.079
Do fuck all as far as l can see.

08:31.120 --> 08:33.587
Mind you, l do have
a permanent boner.

08:46.240 --> 08:49.073
Liam not back from karate yet?

08:49.120 --> 08:50.348
Shit!

08:54.160 --> 08:57.391
My name is Judith,
and l'm an alcoholic.

09:01.040 --> 09:03.395
Do you mind if l have a word?

09:03.440 --> 09:08.753
Don't tell Lip cos l'm on strike,
but l rang the electricity company

09:08.800 --> 09:11.189
and they've not
made a mistake about the bill.

09:11.240 --> 09:14.869
They won't restore the supply
until we've paid. Will yer sort it?

09:14.920 --> 09:18.595
Can we pay your electricity bill?

09:18.640 --> 09:20.596
We run off the same supply.

09:20.640 --> 09:23.393
Steve hooked it up
when he and Fiona lived next door.

09:23.440 --> 09:25.556
lt made it easier for him
to take care of everything.

09:25.600 --> 09:27.397
Did you know about this?

09:27.440 --> 09:28.919
No.

09:28.960 --> 09:30.234
Not right, is it?

09:30.280 --> 09:32.430
Not right, it's criminal.

09:32.480 --> 09:35.677
Hang on. l gave you £50 pound
to pay the electricity bill

09:35.720 --> 09:39.030
not two weeks ago.
What happened to it?

09:39.080 --> 09:40.593
You know what?

09:40.640 --> 09:43.393
l bet l forgot to post it.
l'm always doing that.

09:43.440 --> 09:46.238
Stamp on, then it stays
in me bag for months.

09:46.280 --> 09:48.714
l'll sort it tomorrow.

09:48.760 --> 09:50.478
We'll sort it now.

09:50.520 --> 09:52.909
How many bags have you got?

09:53.520 --> 09:55.238
Nicola's got one like that.

09:55.280 --> 09:57.714
lt's yours. l never use it.

09:57.760 --> 09:59.671
Ahh. Thanks Sue.

09:59.720 --> 10:02.598
Ladies. Bitches. lt'll be
getting dark soon. Bonfire night!

10:02.640 --> 10:04.232
Marty!

10:04.280 --> 10:06.430
Sue can't find the electric bill.

10:06.480 --> 10:08.072
l thought you told me you'd paid it.

10:08.120 --> 10:11.192
l have. l've just not posted it on.

10:11.240 --> 10:13.674
lt won't be in there.

10:13.720 --> 10:15.711
When are you going
to tell us what's going on?

10:15.760 --> 10:17.751
What are you trying to infer, Carol?

10:17.800 --> 10:21.679
l've got eyes in me head, unlike
Marty. New outfit every 20 minutes.

10:21.720 --> 10:24.075
Marty, will you tell her?

10:24.120 --> 10:26.156
Fuck, shit, wank!

10:27.200 --> 10:29.998

the leccy cos l've got meself

10:30.040 --> 10:31.837

10:31.880 --> 10:33.552

10:33.600 --> 10:34.999
How much debt?

10:35.040 --> 10:37.838
l'm waiting on that money
from Craig's dad's house.

10:37.880 --> 10:40.155
< lt'll clear it
with thousands to spare.

10:40.200 --> 10:42.077
Why should l put my life on hold?

10:42.120 --> 10:44.156
How much?

10:44.200 --> 10:46.077
12 grand.

10:52.280 --> 10:53.918
(Sue) Some of them are really nasty.

10:53.960 --> 10:55.996
County court orders and that.

10:56.040 --> 10:58.315
You'll end up inside
if you're not careful.

11:00.080 --> 11:02.992
l'm really sorry, Marty.

11:03.040 --> 11:05.998
- Hey, we'll sort it together, OK?
- Hm!

11:07.880 --> 11:10.997
ls this it though? ls this the lot?
You've got to be honest with me, OK?

11:11.040 --> 11:12.837
Titwank! No more trying to hide it.

11:12.880 --> 11:14.233
Way of life with her. >

11:14.280 --> 11:16.510
Mum.
Just piss off out of it, will yer?

11:23.000 --> 11:24.831
Thank you.

11:24.880 --> 11:26.313
No problem.

11:26.360 --> 11:28.954
lt's like you say, this money
that you're owed from Craig,

11:29.000 --> 11:31.355
well there must
be some way to throw 'em a bone.

11:33.040 --> 11:35.713
- Do you hate me?
- Course l don't.

11:35.760 --> 11:36.988
Blood-sucking bitch!

11:37.040 --> 11:39.918

11:39.960 --> 11:44.158
Sue! You're the best thing that's

11:51.440 --> 11:53.431
Debs' on strike!
lt's doing me head in.

11:53.480 --> 11:55.994
Liam, shoes.

11:56.040 --> 11:57.473
No bread left.

11:57.520 --> 11:59.795
l haven't had time to shop, have l?

12:06.240 --> 12:08.595
We'll get you some
crisps on the way to school.

12:08.640 --> 12:10.551
Where's your socks, Liam?

12:10.600 --> 12:12.272

12:12.320 --> 12:14.436
KNOCK ON DOOR

12:14.480 --> 12:17.438

Thanks!

12:24.040 --> 12:25.359

12:26.440 --> 12:29.159
Look, you're just gonna have to
wear a pair of mine.

12:29.200 --> 12:29.791
They're a bit big but...

12:29.840 --> 12:31.592
Lip, it hurts!

12:31.640 --> 12:34.200
OK fine, no frigging socks!

12:34.240 --> 12:35.958
Go bare feet.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.831
Yeah? Don't ask or owt.

12:37.880 --> 12:40.997
l haven't got any of my own clean,

12:41.040 --> 12:43.508
Oh, who's gonna make
tea for these two then?

12:43.560 --> 12:45.790
l'm supposed to be seeing
Katie and Mandy tonight.

12:45.840 --> 12:47.637
- Can't Carl manage?
- What?

12:47.680 --> 12:50.274
Shit. This is it, you know.
Once Debbie cops off

12:50.320 --> 12:52.788
with some horny little loser,
this is our lives, lan.

12:52.840 --> 12:56.515
- We just need a routine and that.
- Yeah.

12:58.640 --> 13:03.316
Well, no, you're right,
we need a plan. Nip it in the bud.

13:03.360 --> 13:05.351
Scruff.

13:10.960 --> 13:15.192
lt's just a few questions about
your lifestyle, Mr Gallagher.

13:15.240 --> 13:19.472
Right you are, love. Nothing there to
frighten the horses. Happy to oblige.

13:19.520 --> 13:21.476
Right. Male or female.

13:21.520 --> 13:22.748
Oh, definitely a yes!

13:25.280 --> 13:27.714
l'll just... Yeah.

13:29.240 --> 13:30.912
Oh, diet.

13:30.960 --> 13:34.635
Do you eat five portions of
fruit and vegetables a day?

13:34.680 --> 13:37.752
Do l look like fucking Bugs Bunny?

13:37.800 --> 13:39.199
Yes.

13:39.240 --> 13:43.392
How much alcohol do
you consume weekly?

13:43.440 --> 13:47.638
A, no alcohol, B, one to 21 units.

13:47.680 --> 13:51.195
Weekly?
Yeah, weekly.

13:51.240 --> 13:55.552
C, over 21 units.

13:58.360 --> 14:00.920
l see you say you don't drink,
Mr Gallagher.

14:00.960 --> 14:03.633
Yeah, well me mum
was a Methodist, love.

14:03.680 --> 14:05.910
Promised her, on her deathbed.

14:05.960 --> 14:08.076
We'll have to
keep your details on the file.

14:08.120 --> 14:09.519
This particular trial involves

14:09.560 --> 14:12.791
taking the drug in conjunction with
at least two units of alcohol a day.

14:14.480 --> 14:15.959
Ohh.

14:17.000 --> 14:20.436
All right, l'll do it. Well, me
mum was a wonderful woman, you know.

14:20.480 --> 14:24.234
She was...actually she was devoted to
medical science.

14:24.280 --> 14:25.872
Absolutely devoted to it.

14:25.920 --> 14:29.230
She could have trained up if she'd had
the opportunities, donated her body...

14:29.280 --> 14:31.635
you know her eyes, an' all that.

14:31.680 --> 14:34.558
And that was the other thing that
she said to me, on her deathbed.

14:34.600 --> 14:40.072
''Son, promise me you'll do everything
you can for medical science.''

14:40.120 --> 14:42.839
So l'm here.

14:42.880 --> 14:45.599
lt's Lady Muck you should
be asking for money, not me.

14:45.640 --> 14:47.631
l said from the
get-go she was trouble.

14:47.680 --> 14:50.638
Feet under the table
before you could say Jack Robinson.

14:50.680 --> 14:52.591
Sue hasn't got the money.

14:52.640 --> 14:55.393
lf you don't pay to get us
re-connected, it's not gonna happen.

14:55.440 --> 14:57.078
We're all brassic at ours.

14:57.120 --> 15:00.396
Fine state of affairs this is.

15:00.440 --> 15:02.829
We're supposed to be your
tenants, not your parents.

15:02.880 --> 15:06.190
Yeah, and we're charging you 30 quid
a week less than you're claiming

15:06.240 --> 15:08.470
in housing benefits.

15:08.520 --> 15:12.877
l'm supposed to be putting a bit
by for my old age. Nobody cares.

15:12.920 --> 15:16.754
Thanks. And if any of the lads
ask yer, you sorted it yourself.

15:16.800 --> 15:20.315
You know you'll get blackheads
from putting so much make-up on.

15:20.360 --> 15:21.634
< Clogs your pores!

15:32.680 --> 15:37.196
A foaming tankard of your
finest ale, mein inn-keeper!

15:37.240 --> 15:38.753
Frank, you know how it is.

15:38.800 --> 15:41.314
Eh? Eh? Eh?

15:41.360 --> 15:45.114
Half now,
half on completion of the trial.

15:45.160 --> 15:48.118
lt's not just the money.
You feel like you're putting a bit back.

15:48.160 --> 15:52.073
Well, l suppose it's you or them
monkeys they grow the tumours on.

15:52.120 --> 15:55.078
How many of them tablets are
you having to take then, Frank?

15:55.120 --> 15:57.680
Er, three every four hours. Oh.

15:57.720 --> 16:00.188
Four every three hours.

16:14.760 --> 16:17.911
So basically Debt Crunchers,
in agreement with yourself,

16:17.960 --> 16:20.190
take what's known
as a consolidation loan.

16:20.240 --> 16:22.674
You're probably wondering what the
heck that is.

16:22.720 --> 16:24.995
Basically it's a way for us
to pay off all your debts.

16:25.040 --> 16:29.716
Then we organise it for yourselves
to pay one basic monthly fee to us.

16:29.760 --> 16:31.637
Sounds too good to be true.

16:31.680 --> 16:34.911
lt is! People don't realise.
You're home-owners, obviously.

16:34.960 --> 16:36.996
- She is. Well, when...
- Yes!

16:37.040 --> 16:39.110
No worries.

16:52.320 --> 16:55.153
No one's ever looked after
me like you do.

16:55.200 --> 16:57.191
l love looking after you,
you know l do.

16:57.240 --> 16:58.992
l'd do anything l can.

16:59.040 --> 17:01.349
Ball and chain!

17:01.400 --> 17:03.516
But these loans and that though...

17:03.560 --> 17:05.949
Well you hear about people
paying 'em off for years.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.230
Yeah, but it's not
gonna be years, is it?

17:08.280 --> 17:10.794
Once Craig comes good.
l mean that's what l'm saying.

17:10.839 --> 17:13.593
The day he's sold that
house, the sky's the limit.

17:13.640 --> 17:16.029
To the future.

17:16.079 --> 17:18.958
Mud in yer eye. Come on yer face!

17:32.760 --> 17:33.909
Fuck it.

17:49.520 --> 17:51.750
Sue?

17:51.800 --> 17:54.678
We're going to bed Mum!
We're shattered. >

17:54.720 --> 17:55.948
You've got a visitor.

17:59.320 --> 18:00.719
You're looking well.

18:00.760 --> 18:03.479
What the fuck are you doing here?

18:03.520 --> 18:06.239
We've just been having a
little chat, haven't we, Craig?

18:06.280 --> 18:07.679
You poisonous old bitch! >

18:07.720 --> 18:09.950
She's stirring it again.
What's she been saying?

18:10.000 --> 18:13.879
l haven't been saying anything.
lt's what Craig's been telling me.

18:13.920 --> 18:16.593
- You're upsetting Sue.
- She's had it, Marty!

18:16.640 --> 18:17.595
This is none of your business!

18:17.640 --> 18:19.517
He's my son and you're
taking him for a ride.

18:19.560 --> 18:21.915
- l'm taking him for nothing.
- Tell him!

18:21.960 --> 18:24.155
She's had the money
from me dad's house.

18:24.200 --> 18:26.839
Ten grand, nearly eight month ago.

18:26.880 --> 18:29.792
Same old story, is it?
Spunked the lot?

18:29.840 --> 18:31.239
But you said...

18:31.280 --> 18:32.918
The lies never stop, do they, Sue?

18:35.320 --> 18:37.629
- Marty!
- For God's sake!

18:37.680 --> 18:39.079
Fuck, fuck!

18:39.120 --> 18:40.075
Are you all right, mate?

18:40.120 --> 18:41.553
Get the fuck off me!

18:41.600 --> 18:44.068
lt's all true Marty,
l've seen the paperwork!

18:44.120 --> 18:46.918
Take your trousers off.
They need running under a cold tap.

18:46.960 --> 18:48.552
Look, fucking get off me, Mum.

18:48.600 --> 18:51.797
TELEVlSlON PLAYS

18:51.840 --> 18:53.114
Sue?

18:53.160 --> 18:55.355
Sue?

18:56.400 --> 18:58.391
Sue!

19:01.560 --> 19:03.073
Sue!

19:12.120 --> 19:14.475
Bollocks!

19:15.560 --> 19:17.278
Popcorn maker.

19:17.320 --> 19:19.550
Who needs a popcorn maker?

19:19.600 --> 19:23.991
Ha! Too bloody idle to walk to the
shops, yet she spends God knows

19:24.040 --> 19:25.678
how much on a badminton racket.

19:25.720 --> 19:27.392
She's mentally ill.

19:27.440 --> 19:29.158
Ooh, that's handy.

19:29.200 --> 19:31.430
Maybe she and Marty were
gonna be playing doubles.

19:31.480 --> 19:34.358
Yeah, and if they were
you'd find some way of stopping 'em.

19:34.400 --> 19:36.914
Hey. Don't you make me out
to be the villain in this.

19:36.960 --> 19:39.679
She's the one who was
selling Marty down the river.

19:39.720 --> 19:41.790
How?
How's she doing that Mum?

19:41.840 --> 19:43.592
By making him happy?
By stopping him >

19:43.640 --> 19:46.313
setting fire to anything for longer
than we can remember?

19:46.360 --> 19:48.715
By keeping him out of
fucking Strangeways? >

19:48.760 --> 19:50.910
l can't do right by
doing bloody wrong!

19:51.000 --> 19:53.389
< l might have known not to
expect any support from you.

19:53.440 --> 19:55.635
Well you're right on that one.
And think on, yeah.

19:55.680 --> 19:59.116
lf Marty goes back inside, the Gallaghers'll
be looking for new tenants.

19:59.160 --> 20:00.388
And with any luck, >

20:00.440 --> 20:03.352
Kev and me'll be turning
spare room into a nursery.

20:03.400 --> 20:06.836
So don't come crying to us
when you need somewhere to live.

20:20.800 --> 20:22.438
Six, is it?

20:22.480 --> 20:23.356
Yep. This'll be seven.

20:23.400 --> 20:24.879
Brewery needs telling.

20:24.920 --> 20:26.956
Nowt wrong with the ale, Frank.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.833
Look at Denzig,
he's matched you pint for pint.

20:29.880 --> 20:30.790
lt'll be them pills you're taking.

20:30.840 --> 20:34.719
Fuck off. What kind of pills stop
you getting pissed? What would be

20:34.760 --> 20:37.638
the fucking point of that, Jez,
eh, in your medical opinion?

20:37.680 --> 20:40.513
l dunno.
Treating alcoholics?

20:40.560 --> 20:43.996
lf you can't get pissed,
there's no point drinking.

20:47.960 --> 20:50.190
How many Es can you give us Kev?

20:53.840 --> 20:55.558
Marty!

20:55.600 --> 20:57.318
Kev.

20:57.360 --> 20:59.954
Let me go! Let me go!

21:00.000 --> 21:03.117
Marty look, you know l can't.
l promised Vee l'd keep an eye on you.

21:03.160 --> 21:06.516
Let go of me!
l've just gotta find her!

21:06.560 --> 21:08.551
Please, Kev, please.

21:08.600 --> 21:10.238
l think l'm gonna die.

21:10.280 --> 21:13.556
l just wanna fucking torch
the place!

21:13.600 --> 21:15.238
All right. l tell you what,

21:15.280 --> 21:18.078
l'll come with ya, yeah?

21:18.120 --> 21:20.680
Her mum lives in Spain.
That's where she'll have gone.

21:20.720 --> 21:23.154
Whoa...Spain?

21:23.200 --> 21:25.555
But l thought Sue had told me and Vee

21:25.600 --> 21:27.591
that she hadn't spoken
to her mam in ten years.

21:27.640 --> 21:29.198
She's still family, isn't she?

21:29.240 --> 21:31.435
lf you don't want to help us...
Fucking bastard!

21:31.480 --> 21:34.472
All right, all right! Oi, all right.
Where do you wanna go?

21:34.520 --> 21:35.839
To Spain!

21:37.120 --> 21:40.237
No one wants us to
be together, Kev!

21:40.280 --> 21:41.474
Fucking hell!

21:43.600 --> 21:46.478
Course we do! Course we do.
And you will be, won't yer?

21:46.520 --> 21:48.476
You don't fucking believe that.

21:48.520 --> 21:51.956
No one does.
l see 'em looking... Fucking loser!

21:52.000 --> 21:56.596
l do as it happens. You've got something
good. Don't bother what anyone else says.

21:56.640 --> 21:58.471
lf you think Sue's
in Puerto de la Rey,

21:58.520 --> 22:00.829
you get in there,
hand over your passport and pay

22:00.880 --> 22:02.472
whatever it takes to go and get her.

22:02.520 --> 22:05.193
Cos l'm telling you,
you can't put a price on feelings.

22:08.160 --> 22:11.277
- Oi.
- l haven't got a fucking passport, have l?

22:11.320 --> 22:12.799
< Fuck!

22:12.840 --> 22:16.435
Fucking fuck of a fucking fucker!

22:30.920 --> 22:32.512
< How you doin', Craig?

22:32.560 --> 22:33.549
All right Kev.

22:33.600 --> 22:36.194
Er, he's just come to talk.

22:37.760 --> 22:39.751
You'd best come in.

22:42.160 --> 22:44.754
You tried her nan's, in Preston? >

22:44.800 --> 22:46.028
No.

22:46.080 --> 22:49.755
Well, l wouldn't try ringing, she's
a bit senile, but you could go round.

22:49.800 --> 22:52.598
Think Sue'd probably go there
before she'd go to her mum's.

22:52.640 --> 22:55.029
She hasn't spoken to her
mum for years actually.

22:55.080 --> 22:56.399
Word of advice...

22:56.440 --> 22:58.078
No, ta.
Spunk face!

22:58.120 --> 23:02.238
Just leave it, Marty. Let her go wherever she
wants. You're well out of it, believe me.

23:02.280 --> 23:05.829
You don't get it do yer? l love her.
And she loves me.

23:05.880 --> 23:08.713
Sue loves Sue.
And owt with a bar code.

23:08.760 --> 23:11.433
She'll give you the best
blow job you've ever had, >

23:11.480 --> 23:15.712
but if they opened her up, you'd find a cash
register where her heart should be.

23:15.760 --> 23:19.469
Believe me, her leaving you's the
best thing that ever happened to yer.

23:19.520 --> 23:23.069
My life started the day
she walked out that door.

23:23.120 --> 23:25.634
Come on, mate, let's go to Preston.

23:25.680 --> 23:27.750
< You got the address?

23:31.560 --> 23:32.675
He's a cunt!

23:39.880 --> 23:42.553
Thanks. l owe you one.

23:42.600 --> 23:44.830
Well, that's me and every
catalogue company in the country.

23:44.880 --> 23:46.711
Narky bugger.

23:46.760 --> 23:48.159
What did you tell him?

23:48.200 --> 23:49.679
Marty's gutted, you know.

23:49.720 --> 23:51.597
You've broken his heart,
the poor little bastard.

23:51.640 --> 23:55.394
Well, l'm not going back.
Wouldn't give Carol the satisfaction.

23:55.440 --> 23:58.512
You'd better sort something out,
yeah? One night, l said.

23:58.560 --> 24:04.396
lf your nanna's that far gone she won't even
notice you staying with her for a bit.

24:04.600 --> 24:07.478
They're pink.
All of 'em.

24:12.760 --> 24:14.910
Live and learn.

24:14.960 --> 24:16.678
< Can't wear pink to school.

24:16.720 --> 24:19.359
There you are. Wait there a sec.

24:19.400 --> 24:24.190
You know that old hippy-looking
woman who lives at number 27?

24:24.240 --> 24:26.549
< You know,
the one whose house really stinks?

24:26.600 --> 24:28.556
RSPCA finally raided her.

24:28.600 --> 24:31.717
They were giving them away.

24:33.280 --> 24:34.269
What am l, six?

24:34.320 --> 24:36.788
Debs, wait! Look, l know we haven't

24:36.840 --> 24:40.037
been pulling our weight and that
but things are gonna change.

24:40.080 --> 24:42.674
Lip's made a rota, what everyone's
supposed to be doing.

24:42.720 --> 24:46.349
Look! Mondays, Carl - breakfast,
me - tidy up.

24:46.400 --> 24:48.516
< You take Liam to school.

24:48.560 --> 24:49.754
All different colours, see.

24:49.800 --> 24:53.349
Gimme a break. How many
rotas have l made for you lot?

24:53.400 --> 24:56.676
And they never work cos l'm the
only one that sticks to them,

24:56.720 --> 24:58.358
and l end up doing everyone
else's jobs.

24:58.400 --> 25:02.109
So don't piss on my leg
and tell me it's raining.

25:04.360 --> 25:05.839
What does that mean?

25:14.400 --> 25:17.870
Oh, God he's over there.
ls he looking?

25:17.920 --> 25:20.275
Yeah, he's looking, don't look.

25:20.320 --> 25:23.232
Here. Do you wanna sit
on me face, sweetheart?

25:23.280 --> 25:25.430
Or can l just come on your tits? >

25:25.480 --> 25:27.516
You fucking perv!

25:27.560 --> 25:31.269
Come near us again and me dad'll
kick the fucking shit out of yer,

25:31.320 --> 25:33.788
you paedophile bastard!

25:33.840 --> 25:35.910
Oh, right(!)

25:38.440 --> 25:40.556
Total paed.

25:41.960 --> 25:43.188
So is he looking now?

25:43.240 --> 25:45.037
Debbie.

25:47.520 --> 25:48.999
Yeah.

25:52.120 --> 25:56.318
Whoa, Franky boy!
How's it shaking?

25:56.360 --> 26:00.148
Well, it's not, is it? 60 quid on booze and Es
and look at me - sober as a fucking judge.

26:00.200 --> 26:01.952
Nice one!

26:04.000 --> 26:07.629
Never knew the true meaning
of that phrase till today -

26:07.680 --> 26:12.390
sober as a fucking judge.

26:13.760 --> 26:17.036
Jez! l know, long story, long...

26:17.080 --> 26:20.436
Listen, there's more places
in the world than fucking Preston.

26:20.480 --> 26:22.755
She'll probably get in touch.

26:22.800 --> 26:24.199
Why would she? Loser!

26:24.240 --> 26:27.915
Come on! She's not that bad.
She's probably just a bit freaked.

26:27.960 --> 26:31.555
Think l'd fuck off for a bit
if l owed that much money.

26:31.600 --> 26:35.115
Mum said she was using me
and she'd finally bled me dry.

26:35.160 --> 26:37.310
l know! Just give us
two minutes, Jez!

26:37.360 --> 26:39.635
Look, no disrespect,
but that cow wouldn't know

26:39.680 --> 26:42.956
true love if it jumped up
and bit her on the minge.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.275
You really think she loves me, Kev?

26:45.320 --> 26:48.392
Why else she been shagging you the
past year? Your smooth talk and good looks?

26:48.440 --> 26:52.638
Yeah, if l pay it all off for her,
she'd come back, wouldn't she?

26:52.680 --> 26:54.716
l'm gonna do it.
l'll get another job, l know l can!

26:54.760 --> 26:57.399
LAUGHTER

26:57.440 --> 26:59.192
Tommy.

27:00.240 --> 27:02.800
ALARM

27:02.840 --> 27:05.434
ALARM SWlTCHES OFF

27:05.480 --> 27:09.189
l got a lasagne in for tonight.
l know you like it.

27:09.240 --> 27:10.195
l'm working.

27:10.240 --> 27:13.073
l could do chips with it 'n' all.

27:13.120 --> 27:14.599
Not hungry. Selfish cuntl

27:14.640 --> 27:15.789
l like lasagne.

27:15.840 --> 27:17.796
Sweet Jesus, give me strength!

27:17.840 --> 27:20.673
l said lasagne,
not loaves and bloody fishes.

27:21.440 --> 27:24.352
There you are.

27:24.400 --> 27:30.748
You know, if you started wearing a
toupee now, nobody'd know later on.

27:30.800 --> 27:33.872
That was your dad's
mistake, leaving it too late.

27:33.920 --> 27:37.515
DOORBELL RlNGS

27:39.120 --> 27:41.759
Sorry to hear about
your partner, Mr Fisher.

27:41.800 --> 27:42.949
Why, what have you heard?

27:43.000 --> 27:45.230
No, it's nothing like that.
My apologies.

27:45.280 --> 27:49.398
l rang yesterday to speak to yourself
and her about your first payment.

27:49.440 --> 27:51.510
l spoke to a lady.
l presume that was you.

27:51.560 --> 27:52.834
That's right.

27:52.880 --> 27:56.111
She told me that your wife
had done a bit of a runner.

27:56.160 --> 27:58.196
They're not married, thank God.

27:58.240 --> 28:02.711
Right. Seeing as you're co-signatory
to the loan, l thought...

28:02.760 --> 28:04.796
What loan? What's she made you sign?

28:04.840 --> 28:06.876
Nothing! lt's my business, Mum.

28:06.920 --> 28:11.596
Down the shitholel So you mean
that l've got to pay the lot?

28:11.640 --> 28:14.757
Ha! What did l say
all along the line?

28:14.800 --> 28:17.872
She's played you for a
giddy kipper, Martin Fisher.

28:17.920 --> 28:20.957
How in heaven's name are
you gonna pay off £12,000?

28:21.000 --> 28:22.672
lt's time you woke up to yourself.

28:22.720 --> 28:24.358
Fucking shut it, will yal

28:24.400 --> 28:29.155
All my life, you rabbitting on, ''l told you so,
Marty. He's not your friend, Marty.

28:29.200 --> 28:32.192
''Wear a fucking toupee, Marty.''
l have had enough, right?

28:32.240 --> 28:33.912
Hey!

28:33.960 --> 28:38.909
Chill out. All right? All right?!

28:38.960 --> 28:42.032
l'm chilled, l'm chilled,
l'm cool! l'm chilled.

28:42.080 --> 28:44.196
Psychopathl Sorry.

28:44.240 --> 28:47.277
You've only got one mum.
Remember that.

29:03.000 --> 29:04.035
Fuck...l

29:21.080 --> 29:22.559
Cockl

29:30.160 --> 29:34.995
Fuckl Fuckl

29:35.040 --> 29:36.519
Shit itl

29:59.720 --> 30:01.073
Cuntl

30:11.640 --> 30:13.278
How long have you been up?

30:13.320 --> 30:17.029
This was your dad's, weren't it?
Seat's totally gone.

30:17.080 --> 30:19.674
New suite would change
the look of this room.

30:19.720 --> 30:22.439
When did we enter the
fucking twilight zone?

30:22.480 --> 30:25.916
One night, l said, until you sort
something out, and you've already

30:25.960 --> 30:27.313
been here two. Don't push it.

30:27.360 --> 30:28.634
l can't stay at Nana's.

30:28.680 --> 30:31.797
- lt's not my problem.
- Craig, l've got nowhere to go.

30:34.680 --> 30:36.636
l haven't forgotten
how you like it.

30:36.680 --> 30:39.240
Bloody good memory.
What the fuck are you doing?

30:39.280 --> 30:40.633
l'm not playing.

30:40.680 --> 30:44.116
Christ's sake! Three years,
we didn't shag while in this house

30:44.160 --> 30:46.594
and now you've decided
you fancy me again?

30:46.640 --> 30:49.871
l know you've got no self-respect
but this is really low.

30:53.640 --> 30:55.596
l could do though, you know.

30:55.640 --> 30:57.756
Haven't got laid in a while.

30:57.800 --> 31:01.429
But l'd still kick you out afterwards.
Come on, how about it?

31:01.480 --> 31:03.038
Something for nothing for a change?

31:03.080 --> 31:05.469
You bastard!
Marty makes me come like a train!

31:05.520 --> 31:09.354
Everybody's good at something.
He's a disaster in every other way.

31:09.400 --> 31:13.473
Fuck you, Craig!
For your information, Marty...

31:13.520 --> 31:16.592
You don't know the first
thing about Marty, OK?

31:16.640 --> 31:19.598
So you just sit on your dad's
settee and judge the world,

31:19.640 --> 31:22.359
if it makes you feel better.
The hours must fly by.

31:25.200 --> 31:26.679
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

31:29.200 --> 31:30.997
Oh, l forgot.

31:31.040 --> 31:35.158
The reference numbers have come
for the flight and hotel and that.

31:35.200 --> 31:38.829
You don't get tickets any more.
You just turn up at airport.

31:38.880 --> 31:41.314
Oh, and Yvonne was saying

31:41.360 --> 31:45.478
we're best taking our own teabags
cos tea's really shit over there.

31:49.920 --> 31:52.673
- What's up?
- Nothing.

31:52.720 --> 31:53.709
You've gone...

31:53.760 --> 31:56.911
lt's hardly erotic! Talking about
teabags when l'm giving you one?

31:56.960 --> 31:58.916
Do you want me...?

31:58.960 --> 32:02.635
You're all right. lt's like trying
to put a slug in a slot machine.

32:05.240 --> 32:07.390
What's going on, Kev?

32:07.440 --> 32:10.876
Nothing. l'm knackered. Double shift
and babysitting Marty all night.

32:10.920 --> 32:13.115
lt were the same the other morning.

32:13.160 --> 32:17.039
lt's not guilt, is it?
You're not slipping it someone else?

32:17.080 --> 32:19.594
No! lt's nothing like that.

32:19.640 --> 32:21.119
Well, what?

32:24.760 --> 32:27.274
Flying, OK?

32:27.320 --> 32:29.151
l've got a fear of flying.

32:29.200 --> 32:32.351
And every time l think about
it or you talk about it,

32:32.400 --> 32:35.198
l get fucking limp.

32:35.240 --> 32:36.958
lt's a phobia, Veronica.

32:38.520 --> 32:40.431
Fuck off, you jessie!

32:40.480 --> 32:42.630
Fear of flying?!

32:51.920 --> 32:55.549
There isn't an antidote,
Mr Gallagher.

32:55.600 --> 32:57.716
You're shitting me!

32:57.760 --> 33:01.389
Well, the drug isn't toxic, but you
have had some extreme reaction.

33:01.440 --> 33:05.433
You'll just have to
wait for it to clear your system.

33:09.480 --> 33:12.153
How would you describe
your reaction?

33:14.360 --> 33:18.592
lt's like everything's...

33:20.600 --> 33:24.229
..y'know...real.

33:46.280 --> 33:47.713
Have a word, Marty?

33:47.760 --> 33:49.637
What's going on?

33:49.680 --> 33:51.318
Sue! Fucking bitch!

33:51.360 --> 33:53.635
We need him to come down station.

33:53.680 --> 33:55.796
What's he supposed to have done?

33:55.840 --> 33:58.308
There's been an arson attack on
the precinct down Adelaide Way.

33:58.360 --> 33:59.429
Adelaide Way?

33:59.480 --> 34:03.632
One of the shops got burnt out.
All the hallmarks, l'm afraid.

34:03.680 --> 34:05.511
Well, go on, tell 'em!

34:05.560 --> 34:07.516
- Tell us what?
- What?

34:07.560 --> 34:11.074
He's been in Preston with me.
Only came back for a change of clothes.

34:11.120 --> 34:14.998
Nanna's had a stroke. When's it
supposed to have happened, the fire?

34:15.040 --> 34:16.712
Some time yesterday evening.

34:16.760 --> 34:19.672
Well, l don't see how...
We took it in turn to hold Nanna's hand

34:19.719 --> 34:24.032
all through the night - not that
she knew we were there, bless her.

34:24.080 --> 34:27.755
l can give you the number of the
hospital if you want to check.

34:27.800 --> 34:28.789
lt's St Catherine's.

34:28.840 --> 34:31.353
All right, love. Sorry, Marty.

34:31.400 --> 34:32.719
Fucking pigs!

34:34.120 --> 34:37.635
l said to Tony straight off,
why the fuck would Marty want

34:37.679 --> 34:40.513
to burn down a Poverty Action
shop in the first place?

34:48.800 --> 34:49.789
Fuck it!

35:00.520 --> 35:05.913
Hey, brand new, that.
We're not made of money.

35:05.960 --> 35:08.190
l really appreciate it, you know,

35:08.240 --> 35:11.437
you trying to torch
the debt place for me.

35:11.480 --> 35:12.993
Didn't do it for you, did l?

35:13.040 --> 35:16.953
l did it for me, seeing you'd
run out and left me in the shit.

35:17.000 --> 35:18.991
But l'm back now, aren't l, eh?

35:19.040 --> 35:22.476
l just needed a bit of time
to sort my head out.

35:22.520 --> 35:23.953
Don't!

35:24.000 --> 35:26.468
Marty?

35:26.520 --> 35:28.556
Can't we start again,

35:28.600 --> 35:30.909
clean slate?

35:30.960 --> 35:36.114
l know we've still got debt,
but l just wanna put things right.

35:36.160 --> 35:37.798
No point, is there?

35:37.840 --> 35:40.673
lt's gone too far, all the lying.

35:42.560 --> 35:44.232
We're finished, you and me.

35:51.400 --> 35:52.992
Massive hard-onl

35:59.280 --> 36:01.316
Right, yard sale.

36:01.360 --> 36:04.511
We'll shift all this lot in
no time. Debbie, you're with me.

36:04.560 --> 36:05.788
Sorry, l'm off out.

36:05.840 --> 36:09.355
Start tagging it up.
Price it as high as you can.

36:09.400 --> 36:13.712
People just think it's shit if
you try to shift it for nothing.

36:13.760 --> 36:17.833
Come on, get a move on!
Right, l'll do it all meself then.

36:17.880 --> 36:19.438
Marty!

36:19.480 --> 36:21.152
Where did that come from?

36:21.200 --> 36:24.397
Yard sale?
After all she's landed on you,

36:24.440 --> 36:28.752
you think selling a few bits and bobs'll sort it?
You're even softer in the head than l thought.

36:28.800 --> 36:31.837
Hard to believe, as you treat
me like the world's biggest

36:31.880 --> 36:33.233
fucking retard. Fuck!

36:33.280 --> 36:37.432
lf you're having her back, Marty,
l wash my hands of you, l really do.

36:37.480 --> 36:41.439
Well, l am. lf you've got anything else to say,
you can say it outside this house.

36:41.480 --> 36:44.199
ln fact, you can pack your bags, OK?

36:44.240 --> 36:46.800
Fuck off and die!
We don't want you here.

36:50.440 --> 36:52.032
Hello, cheeky chops.

36:52.080 --> 36:54.275
Hello. Nigel...

36:54.320 --> 36:56.231
There's more in the
pot, if you want it.

36:56.280 --> 36:59.670
You have been busy.

36:59.720 --> 37:02.632
Eh, now we've got a
minute, we can go through

37:02.680 --> 37:06.912
that stuff my sister sent me for
the wedding - you know, flowers?

37:06.960 --> 37:12.193
What am l on about? These are
the invitations. Replied, coming.

37:12.240 --> 37:15.152
Replied - not coming.

37:15.200 --> 37:18.397
Oh, abusive. We don't have
to go through these yet.

37:18.440 --> 37:21.796
Wouldn't it be terrible
if we forgot someone?

37:23.320 --> 37:27.029
Sheila, you're a very damaged woman.

37:27.080 --> 37:29.799
You live in a fantasy world
half the time, you have to

37:29.840 --> 37:33.150
take a lorry-load of tablets
just to get downstairs.

37:33.200 --> 37:37.955
Why are you adding to your
troubles by marrying me, eh?

37:38.000 --> 37:40.468
Mr Right?!

37:40.520 --> 37:45.071
l mean, if l'm the answer,
what's the fucking question, eh?

37:46.400 --> 37:51.235
l'm a waster, Sheila -
always have been, always will be.

37:51.280 --> 37:54.716
And you can chuck as many
vol au vents as you like at it, love,

37:54.760 --> 37:57.911
but it's not exactly made
in fucking heaven, is it?

37:57.960 --> 38:01.635
l never said vol au vents.

38:01.680 --> 38:04.194
l never ordered vol au vents.

38:09.240 --> 38:10.355
Why here?

38:10.400 --> 38:14.552
Ah, fuck off! Change of scenery.
Spice things up a bit, mm?

38:18.600 --> 38:20.591
JET ENGlNES ROAR lN DlSTANCE

38:20.640 --> 38:22.392
You're all right.

38:22.440 --> 38:27.878
JET ENGlNES ROAR
Aaaargh!

38:27.920 --> 38:29.956
Get off!

38:30.000 --> 38:32.833
Fucking hell, Veronica.
What are you playing at?

38:32.880 --> 38:34.359
Where are you going?

38:34.400 --> 38:38.154
lt's what they do with phobias,
ain't it? Remember that programme?

38:38.200 --> 38:40.668
Like putting spiders on your arm
when you're frightened of spiders.

38:40.720 --> 38:43.280
l'm frightened of them up there!

38:43.320 --> 38:44.355
Yeah, l know but...

38:44.400 --> 38:46.675
No, no buts! lt's not natural!

38:46.720 --> 38:48.278
They fucking crash!

38:51.720 --> 38:53.551
They fucking crash.

38:53.600 --> 38:56.512
We'll lose our £100 deposit.

38:58.560 --> 39:03.270
l suppose you could ask your
cousin Dave about his caravan.

39:12.000 --> 39:14.560
Can l get you a drink, Frank?

39:14.600 --> 39:16.556
That's very kind, Carol.

39:16.600 --> 39:18.875
l'll have an orange juice.

39:29.800 --> 39:32.633
No, no, no, no!

39:34.200 --> 39:35.269
Oh, well...

39:39.600 --> 39:42.876
lt's like shagging with a johnny on.

39:42.920 --> 39:45.559
Course, it suits the
pharmaceutical industries

39:45.600 --> 39:49.878
to develop tools to control the
masses, to deny them pleasure.

39:49.920 --> 39:52.593
They'd put it in the water,
if they could.

39:52.640 --> 39:55.632
Then, once they've sterilised
the lot of us...

39:55.680 --> 39:57.636
Eh?

39:57.680 --> 40:00.114
Not that l'd say no, at this point.

40:02.600 --> 40:06.388
Oh, it's a long, long way

40:06.440 --> 40:08.351
From May

40:08.400 --> 40:11.153
To September

40:11.200 --> 40:16.069
But the wind blows cold

40:16.120 --> 40:20.830
When you reach November.

40:20.880 --> 40:22.359
What?

40:22.400 --> 40:24.595
l always thought you talked
shite cos you were pissed.

40:27.760 --> 40:29.637
No Sheila tonight, Frank?

40:29.680 --> 40:35.357
Nah, l've blown it,
haven't l, with Sheila.

40:35.400 --> 40:38.631
Said things that were better
left unsaid.

40:38.680 --> 40:41.319
Well, you'd better
make it right again.

40:41.360 --> 40:45.876
Bed, board and someone to keep you
company - you shouldn't knock it.

40:45.920 --> 40:49.629
l've never knocked it, have l?
l've just had enough of this wedding.

40:49.680 --> 40:52.911
Well, you're not getting any
younger, Frank. None of us are.

40:52.960 --> 40:58.796
Mark my words, it's no joke
being on your own at my age.

41:01.760 --> 41:03.239
No.

41:08.240 --> 41:10.470
Cos they stick you in a home

41:10.520 --> 41:13.512
in front of the telly with a pair
of incontinence pants on.

41:15.480 --> 41:18.950
Never see them from one
Christmas to the next.

41:19.000 --> 41:23.949
Slice of turkey roll once a year - that's the only
thing you've gotta look forward to.

41:24.000 --> 41:25.718
And they have to cut it up for you,

41:25.760 --> 41:29.036
cos they won't let you have
your teeth in case you choke.

41:32.160 --> 41:33.878
Smell of piss.

41:37.520 --> 41:40.830
Bloke in the chair opposite,
sat there trembling.

41:43.280 --> 41:45.555
Home And Away on full volume.

42:00.320 --> 42:03.835
Thanks, Carol, love.
l will have a word.

42:22.080 --> 42:23.479
Where's the settee?

42:23.520 --> 42:25.909
Someone gave us a
hundred quid for it.

42:25.960 --> 42:28.758
Still only made shy of 700 quid.

42:28.800 --> 42:30.279
A drop in the ocean, really.

42:30.320 --> 42:32.550
Oh, you do surprise me(!)

42:35.080 --> 42:38.117
l've got a proposition to
put to you, as it happens.

42:38.160 --> 42:40.469
l've been onto the Citizens Advice.

42:40.520 --> 42:44.195
There's something called an
lndividual Voluntary Arrangement.

42:44.240 --> 42:48.233
They take care of your creditors, and
you pay them back as much as you can.

42:48.280 --> 42:50.510
Yeah, we've already
been down that road, ta.

42:50.560 --> 42:52.437
You've got cancellation rights.

42:52.480 --> 42:54.869
lt's in the papers you signed.

42:54.920 --> 42:56.956
28 days to change your mind.

42:57.000 --> 42:59.309
So we're back to square one?

42:59.360 --> 43:01.476
Marty is.

43:01.520 --> 43:03.238
You're still £12,000 in the red.

43:03.280 --> 43:07.273
This lndividual thingummy,
it's all kosher, reasonable interest,

43:07.320 --> 43:08.639
but you need security,

43:08.680 --> 43:10.875
and l'm offering to stand it for you.

43:10.920 --> 43:12.638
You? What with?

43:12.680 --> 43:16.355
My house. The one Marty burnt down.
Well, they built it again.

43:16.400 --> 43:19.233
Finished in April.
Got a good set of tenants in there.

43:19.280 --> 43:21.111
Why?

43:21.160 --> 43:22.593
You hate my guts.

43:22.640 --> 43:28.158
You stay with Marty, five years,
and l'll have a place to live.

43:28.200 --> 43:32.113
Yeah, but Carol, you just
said you've got a house.

43:32.160 --> 43:35.277
No, it's lonely on your own.

43:35.320 --> 43:36.992
Five years,

43:37.040 --> 43:40.112
l'll stay with you, you stay with Marty,
Marty stays out of trouble.

43:40.160 --> 43:43.436
And then l get a
credit rating again?

43:43.480 --> 43:44.993
Like nothing's happened.

43:45.040 --> 43:48.794
But you can't have a credit
card while you're paying it off.

43:48.840 --> 43:50.990
But Marty could, right?

44:06.720 --> 44:07.709
Can l finger you?

44:13.080 --> 44:15.275
- What's up with him?
- l don't fancy him.

44:15.320 --> 44:16.309
So?

44:16.360 --> 44:18.191
So, l don't fancy him.

44:18.240 --> 44:20.196
You don't fancy anyone.

44:20.240 --> 44:22.390
You're right weird, you.

44:35.800 --> 44:38.189
BURPS

44:41.640 --> 44:45.189
Hallelujahl Hallelujahl

44:45.240 --> 44:47.310
Hallelujah, hallelujah.

44:49.040 --> 44:51.190

44:51.240 --> 44:55.472
Hallelujah, hallelujahl

44:55.520 --> 44:59.035
Hallelujah, hallelujah

44:59.080 --> 45:00.957

45:01.000 --> 45:04.993
FlREWORKS BANG AND CRACKLE

45:07.960 --> 45:09.712
Hallelujah, hallelujah

45:09.760 --> 45:12.672
Hallelujah, hallelujah...

45:36.280 --> 45:37.713
DOOR CLOSES

45:39.200 --> 45:41.668
Hallelujah!

45:44.360 --> 45:48.035
Frank Gallagher is back in the room!

45:51.040 --> 45:54.350
Sheila, my love,

45:54.400 --> 45:56.595
my bride-to-be.

45:58.680 --> 45:59.669
Frank!

45:59.720 --> 46:07.513
Ha-lle-lu-jah.

46:16.240 --> 46:17.559
Pasta bake all right?

46:17.600 --> 46:19.397
Great.

46:19.440 --> 46:20.589
My turn on the rota.

46:20.640 --> 46:22.471
Cheers.

46:22.520 --> 46:23.873
Marty,
make room for your mum, will you?

46:23.920 --> 46:26.036
(Debbie) lt's a bit hot.

46:28.360 --> 46:29.554
Where are the kittens?

46:29.600 --> 46:32.239
Oh, l flogged them with
the rest of me stuff.

46:32.280 --> 46:34.157
l got a fiver for each of them.

46:34.200 --> 46:37.476
This looks lovely. Carol?

46:37.520 --> 46:39.636
There you go, Marty.

46:41.560 --> 46:45.997
(Debbie) 'They say you can choose your
friends, but you can't choose your family.

46:46.040 --> 46:49.032
'Which is a totally
no-brainer, obviously.

46:49.080 --> 46:50.991
'But if you could choose your family,

46:51.040 --> 46:54.191
'l reckon you wouldn't
choose anyone different.

46:54.240 --> 46:57.630
'Cos if you did,
and everything was all perfect,

46:57.680 --> 47:00.035
'who could you blame
when things went wrong?

47:00.080 --> 47:02.310
'Just yourself, and
that's got to be crap.'

47:02.360 --> 47:03.839
(Marty) Bucket of spunk!

47:05.040 --> 47:07.554
l was married before.

47:07.600 --> 47:09.830
He's buried in the garden.

47:09.880 --> 47:11.438
Leave the patio alone.

47:11.480 --> 47:13.948
Fucking hell!

47:14.000 --> 47:15.638
Party!

47:18.440 --> 47:21.273
(Veronica) lt's your wedding day.
lf you're not going to marry her,

47:21.320 --> 47:23.709
you have got to tell her.

47:23.760 --> 47:26.513
Fuck me!
