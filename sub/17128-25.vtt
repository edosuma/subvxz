00:05.106 --> 00:07.738
HEY, YOU TWO. HOW ARE
THE WEDDING PLANS COMING?

00:07.738 --> 00:10.681

ALL THE DECISIONS,

00:14.615 --> 00:16.016

EVEN TALK ABOUT KIDS?

A BIG, FANCY CEREMONY,

TO DO IT IN A COURTHOUSE.

00:36.237 --> 00:38.669
BUT NOT THE VAN NUYS
COURTHOUSE.

WHO THINKS I´M IN A WHEELCHAIR.

00:45.716 --> 00:48.649
IF I´M ONLY GONNA DO THIS ONCE,
I WANT TO DO IT RIGHT.

00:48.649 --> 00:51.452

IT´S A LITTLE LATE
FOR ME TO BE WEARING WHITE.

00:59.130 --> 01:00.461
IT WAS ALMOST TOO LATE

01:00.461 --> 01:03.664
FOR ME TO WEAR WHITE
TO MY OWN CONFIRMATION.

01:03.664 --> 01:07.198
GRANDMA, YOU SHOULD
HAVE A BIG WEDDING.

01:07.198 --> 01:08.739

GONNA BE AUNT SYLVIA.

EVERYONE´S LOOKING AT ME.

01:31.792 --> 01:33.824

01:37.668 --> 01:40.201

COMPROMISE SO MUCH.

01:40.201 --> 01:42.273

SOMETHING HERE.

01:42.273 --> 01:44.405

HE´S SEEN YOU IN THE MORNING,
AND HE´S STILL HERE. HONOR THAT.

OF WHAT I´M ABOUT TO SAY,

01:55.816 --> 02:00.221
THEY´RE GONNA BE PICKING UP
THEIR TEETH FROM THE FLOOR.

02:34.655 --> 02:38.259

A CLEAN BACHELOR PARTY,
