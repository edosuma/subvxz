In the criminal justice system

00:04.017 --> 00:07.931
the people are represented by two
separate yet equally important groups,

00:07.988 --> 00:09.763
the police
who investigate crime

00:09.856 --> 00:12.666
and the district attorneys
who prosecute the offenders.

Her last start...

00:21.768 --> 00:23.770
She was over-matched.
But I still lost.

You did.

who I liked.

casing the place?

01:14.755 --> 01:16.928
No. I was just walking
with them, talking.

About what?
The third race.

01:18.859 --> 01:22.898
I gave them a good tip, too.
Alby's Gal. Came in 38 bucks to win.

01:24.030 --> 01:25.100
They should have bet.

01:25.165 --> 01:26.200
Thanks.

All this body armor, and they
forgot the bullet-proof ski mask.

Paid $38 to win.

01:52.926 --> 01:54.371
He thinks the guards
should have bet.

01:55.295 --> 01:56.933

02:48.797 --> 02:51.801

He kept himself in shape.

02:53.135 --> 02:56.673
Thickened skin on the
index finger of the left hand.

02:57.172 --> 02:58.549
He could have been a carpenter.

02:58.607 --> 02:59.950
Hammer kept missing the nail?

03:00.209 --> 03:05.454
Or a do-it-yourself er.
These scars, from the knee to the hip,

03:06.081 --> 03:08.493
fragments of something hit him
at fairly high velocity.

03:08.584 --> 03:10.393
The bird house
he was building blew up?

03:10.452 --> 03:11.658
Maybe a car accident.

03:11.720 --> 03:14.667
Or shrapnel. See how
the skin is stretched?

Take a look at the slide mechanism.

03:39.148 --> 03:41.150
It's been modified
from semi to full auto.

03:41.717 --> 03:44.220
Yeah. Our do-it-yourself er
isn't just a carpenter.

aren't hard,

03:46.021 --> 03:47.398

03:47.556 --> 03:49.729
What about the bullet that
killed the guard? Wells?

03:49.858 --> 03:51.303
Didn't come from these guns.

03:51.360 --> 03:52.430
The guy that got away?

03:52.961 --> 03:56.033
The residue in the casings
indicates that all three guns

03:56.098 --> 03:57.634
used the same
kind of ammunition.

03:57.733 --> 04:00.213

04:00.502 --> 04:03.415
From the proportions of lead,
barium, and antimony,

04:03.472 --> 04:05.418

04:05.507 --> 04:07.578
Extra kick. Something
they cooked up at home?

04:07.643 --> 04:09.281
Sure, depending on the home.

04:09.378 --> 04:11.858
Yeah, but not something
you'd find in Martha Stewart.

04:13.982 --> 04:16.394
The good news is, the second
guard's gonna make it.

04:16.452 --> 04:17.897
And the perp in the hospital?

04:17.986 --> 04:19.522

04:19.588 --> 04:21.795
But Latent rolled
his prints and the DOA's.

04:21.857 --> 04:23.859
And the third guy
disappeared into thin air.

04:23.926 --> 04:25.496

I don't have to tell you
anything about my politics.

CURTIS: "What about Waco?

11:38.593 --> 11:41.631
"The Feds pumped the Davidian
compound full of CS,

11:41.696 --> 11:46.372
"which is highly flammable, and then started

12:01.183 --> 12:02.218
It's 3:00 in the morning.

That's when they
come out of the woodwork.

I'm ready. Do you know any Web

What are you doing?

near urban centers.

12:30.979 --> 12:32.253
Lennie, we're in.

12:35.851 --> 12:37.353
You got this from a chat room?

12:37.419 --> 12:39.160
A New Sons
of Liberty sub-site.

12:39.221 --> 12:40.894
Which we found
through a chat room.

12:40.989 --> 12:44.493
This tells you how to modify a
semi-automatic weapon to full auto

12:44.559 --> 12:47.199
in the same way the guns used
in the robbery were modified.

12:47.996 --> 12:50.567
Are we sure one of the New
Sons of Liberty posted it?

12:50.665 --> 12:53.202
No, but it's a connection.

12:54.102 --> 12:55.103
It's a stretch.

12:55.237 --> 12:57.274
Your Honor, if I publish
a magazine article

12:57.339 --> 12:59.546
by an anonymous author
on how to make a bomb...

12:59.608 --> 13:00.951
You're gonna protect
your anonymous author.

13:01.009 --> 13:03.421
But if that article
advocates using that bomb...

13:03.478 --> 13:06.254
Can I subpoena your notes to find
out the identity of the author?

13:07.215 --> 13:08.489
We're on very
murky ground here.

13:08.583 --> 13:10.585
This is speech protected
by the First Amendment.

13:10.652 --> 13:12.632
With these instructions,
the New Sons of Liberty

13:12.687 --> 13:15.190
advocate illegal use
of automatic weapons.

13:15.323 --> 13:19.271
It's no longer free speech, it's a verbal act.
An illegal act.

13:20.362 --> 13:23.036
I don't know.
I don't like this.

13:25.333 --> 13:28.371
My daughter just had a baby.
A girl. Two weeks ago.

13:28.436 --> 13:30.643
I want her to have
the same freedoms I've had.

13:30.839 --> 13:33.046
And if she becomes
an armored car guard?

13:36.678 --> 13:38.282
Give me the paper.

13:41.049 --> 13:42.153
I figured you'd be back.

13:42.217 --> 13:43.287
With a warrant?

13:44.452 --> 13:48.594
I was going to say
with stormtroopers.

13:48.790 --> 13:50.531
Look, why don't you
make it easy on all of us

13:50.592 --> 13:52.765
and just give us a list
of the New Sons of Liberty?

13:54.562 --> 13:56.235
Am I under arrest?
No.

14:02.270 --> 14:05.114
Lock up when you're done.

14:05.173 --> 14:06.481
Keep an eye on him.

14:10.445 --> 14:13.255
The New Sons of Liberty membership list.
Twenty in all.

14:13.715 --> 14:15.319
A nice round number.

14:15.450 --> 14:17.088
Not enough to
start a revolution.

14:17.285 --> 14:18.923
More than enough
to rob an armored car.

14:19.020 --> 14:21.364
We need search warrants for
their homes and workplaces

14:21.423 --> 14:23.266
to be executed simultaneously.

14:23.325 --> 14:24.702
6:00 a.m.

14:24.759 --> 14:25.965
A big show of force.

14:26.928 --> 14:28.373
Will the department
back you up on this?

14:28.430 --> 14:29.602
I'll get the money.

14:30.765 --> 14:32.301
Then, I'll get the warrants.

14:41.810 --> 14:45.053
What are you looking for?
My son is only 17!

14:45.113 --> 14:47.559
The New Sons of Liberty
don't have an age limit.

14:48.583 --> 14:51.655
Read the warrant. If you have any
questions, I'll be glad to answer them.

14:54.723 --> 14:57.169

that cabinet over there.

15:09.337 --> 15:11.112
Hey, Sergeant.
Yes, sir?

15:11.306 --> 15:12.785
Open this up.

15:31.626 --> 15:33.936
a bunch of M16s, boxes of ammo.

15:34.295 --> 15:36.673
Yeah. Enough guns to
take over Staten Island.

15:36.765 --> 15:38.676
Take a picture and send
it to Charlton Heston.

15:38.800 --> 15:41.371
Pack this stuff up.
Take everybody downtown.

15:41.569 --> 15:43.014
Okay. Let's go now.

Private, New Sons of Liberty, 016.

15:49.477 --> 15:53.516
Okay, Mr. Cray, Lewis.
We're gonna need to know your whereabouts

of Tuesday, August Sth.

1980. Private,
New Sons of Liberty, 018.

16:13.501 --> 16:17.210
Listen up, tin soldier,
this is no game.

16:17.872 --> 16:20.182
Felony murder means
a needle in the arm,

16:20.241 --> 16:25.054
so if you don't want to be the
sucker on the slab, wise up.

16:25.547 --> 16:29.825
Brant, Matthew Jr.
December 18th, 1980. Private...

16:29.884 --> 16:33.559
Automatic weapons,
munitions, body armor.

16:33.621 --> 16:38.593
Is that what the robbery was
for, more guns? Bigger guns?

16:42.230 --> 16:45.871
Major,

16:47.068 --> 16:48.411
LT, you have a call.

16:50.138 --> 16:52.641
Make sure
the Major is comfortable.

16:58.880 --> 17:02.225
So far I've got calls
from the ATF, the FBI,

17:02.283 --> 17:04.593
the whole alphabet soup down
in Washington.

17:05.220 --> 17:06.563
Let them take a number.

17:06.621 --> 17:09.431
It's our case, New York City.
They have no jurisdiction.

17:09.557 --> 17:11.468
They took jurisdiction in Waco.

17:11.859 --> 17:12.861
JACK: The murder weapon?

17:13.428 --> 17:14.839
VAN BUREN:
Not among the ones we found.

17:14.996 --> 17:17.032
ROSS: They're smart.
Probably tossed it in the Hudson.

17:17.232 --> 17:20.111
If it's any consolation, we have
the militia members' prints

17:20.167 --> 17:21.271
all over the guns.

17:21.836 --> 17:23.542
But no connection
to the murder.

17:25.140 --> 17:28.314
So after all that, we charge
them with simple gun possession.

17:28.810 --> 17:33.281
They post bail. We look like
fascists or idiots, take your pick.

Yeah?

17:44.659 --> 17:46.138
Thanks for calling.

17:46.895 --> 17:49.569
Ballistics.
The special powder in the ammunition,

17:49.631 --> 17:51.133
the home-load
used in the robbery,

17:51.199 --> 17:53.839
they found it in the arsenal
seized in Christie's house.

17:57.071 --> 17:59.210
But we don't have
the murder weapon.

Your Honor, for all defendants

18:46.026 --> 18:47.664
Your Honor,
the People request remand.

18:47.728 --> 18:50.174
Your Honor, we move
that all charges be dismissed

18:50.397 --> 18:53.173
on the grounds that
we are prisoners of war

18:53.233 --> 18:55.042
under the terms of
the Geneva Convention.

18:55.102 --> 18:56.274
What?

18:56.937 --> 19:00.817
Mr. Christie, this is
a civilian criminal court.

19:00.874 --> 19:02.217
I have no authority
to rule on your motion.

19:03.510 --> 19:06.923
Your Honor.
That flag has fringes on it,

19:07.047 --> 19:09.288
which means it is
a military flag.

19:09.349 --> 19:11.852
Which means this court
is a military tribunal.

of war exempt from trial.

this is a civilian

What's he talking about?

19:33.707 --> 19:36.483
The New Sons of Liberty believe they're
at war with the US Government.

19:36.543 --> 19:39.422
And Son of Sam got his
marching orders from a dog.

19:39.546 --> 19:40.547
It's nonsense.

19:40.614 --> 19:43.322
Have you read their manifesto?

19:43.383 --> 19:45.056
"For the sake of global trade,

19:45.118 --> 19:48.861
"low wages and high profits, the US
Government has mortgaged its sovereignty

19:52.859 --> 19:55.897
"with extraordinary powers to
enforce this new world order."

19:56.163 --> 19:57.403
You could make a case for that.

19:57.664 --> 19:59.871
Have you started wearing
fatigues under your clothes?

20:00.100 --> 20:02.546
Jack, these are not religious
fanatics living on a compound.

20:02.602 --> 20:04.081
They're articulate...
Misguided...

20:04.204 --> 20:07.151
Definitely, but don't underestimate them.
They've got lots of support.

20:07.240 --> 20:10.084
They've already raised six of
the $20 million they need,

20:10.143 --> 20:11.349
from every state in the union,

20:11.411 --> 20:13.448
not one contribution over $500.

20:14.047 --> 20:16.152
And who was this guard they killed?
A redcoat?

20:16.950 --> 20:18.657
You need to prove
there was a conspiracy.

20:19.553 --> 20:23.160
Seventy rounds fired, two dead.
No problem with the overt act.

20:23.490 --> 20:25.731
And your proof of the agreement
to commit the robbery?

20:25.792 --> 20:27.430
So far no one's rolled on that.

20:27.494 --> 20:29.235
The agreement can be inferred

20:29.296 --> 20:31.367
from membership
in the New Sons of Liberty.

20:31.732 --> 20:32.938
ROSS:
Guilt by association?

20:33.000 --> 20:36.607
If it's an association dedicated
to murder and mayhem, why not?

20:43.210 --> 20:45.247
Now I have to
take him seriously.

20:46.580 --> 20:49.083
Christie got his motion
in front of Judge Scarletti.

20:50.017 --> 20:53.294
Just be sure we don't have to go
to The Hague to try this case.

20:53.887 --> 20:54.957
Ha!

20:55.155 --> 20:58.932
The Geneva Convention
defines prisoners of war

20:58.992 --> 21:02.405
as "persons who have fallen
into the power of the enemy."

21:02.796 --> 21:04.537
The enemy being
the District Attorney?

21:04.598 --> 21:06.509
And any office or
branch of any government

21:06.566 --> 21:09.103
which is not constituted
of and by the people.

21:09.436 --> 21:11.848
Your Honor, how long are we
going to humor this man?

21:12.239 --> 21:14.810
On its face, this is
a patently absurd motion.

21:14.941 --> 21:17.148
Mr. McCoy, please.

21:18.912 --> 21:20.448
Go on, Mr. Christie.

21:21.214 --> 21:24.354
Under the convention,
such prisoners of war

21:24.418 --> 21:27.058
include the armed forces
of a party to a conflict,

21:27.120 --> 21:29.999
as well as members of
militia or volunteer corps,

21:30.057 --> 21:33.061
including members of an
organized resistance movement.

21:33.126 --> 21:35.333
Your Honor, the convention
protects combatants,

21:35.395 --> 21:36.772
not common criminals.

21:37.197 --> 21:40.007
It requires the existence
of an open, armed conflict.

21:40.100 --> 21:42.307
Lexington, Concord,
Bunker Hill,

21:42.369 --> 21:44.781
the Revolutionary War
was fought for months

21:44.838 --> 21:46.909
before hostilities
were officially declared.

21:46.973 --> 21:48.543
JACK: They didn't attack
an Army base.

21:48.608 --> 21:51.020
They robbed a New York
State Betting Office.

21:51.244 --> 21:52.621
At best, they're terrorists.

21:52.679 --> 21:55.717
Mr. Christie's so-called army
amounts to 20-odd hoodlums.

21:55.782 --> 21:57.284
Twenty? 1,000? 10,000?

21:57.651 --> 21:59.221
How many have to
believe what I believe

21:59.286 --> 22:00.959
before you recognize
my right to say,

22:01.021 --> 22:04.059
"This is wrong,
this must be changed"?

22:04.724 --> 22:07.933
Mr. Christie, this isn't
a First Amendment issue.

22:08.895 --> 22:11.068
Your motion has
been tried in the past

22:11.131 --> 22:13.634
by the Black Panthers
and by other groups.

22:14.468 --> 22:18.439
Granting it would give license
to any criminal organization

22:18.605 --> 22:21.142
to circumvent
the criminal justice system

22:21.208 --> 22:26.089
by declaring themselves at war with
the government. Motion denied.

22:26.847 --> 22:30.351
As to your motion to act as
your own counsel, it's granted.

22:30.684 --> 22:35.963
But I want Ms. Mandel to
serve as your legal adviser.

22:37.491 --> 22:40.563
Now, we're going to trial.

22:44.264 --> 22:47.245
Did you compare the gunpowder found in Mr.
Christie's basement

22:47.334 --> 22:48.779
to that found at
the crime scene?

22:48.835 --> 22:49.973
Yes, sir.

22:50.237 --> 22:51.409
And what did you find?

22:51.505 --> 22:53.041
"We hold these truths

22:53.106 --> 22:54.676

endowed by their creator..."

22:57.344 --> 22:58.414
Silence in the court!

"...with certain
unalienable rights..."

23:00.013 --> 23:01.424
JUDGE SCARLETTI: Bailiff,
please remove the defendant.

23:01.481 --> 23:02.687
(GAVEL POUNDING)
Order in the court.

23:02.749 --> 23:03.921
ROBBINS: "...that among
these are life, liberty,

23:03.984 --> 23:05.895
"and the pursuit of happiness.

23:05.986 --> 23:10.264
"That to secure these rights governments
are instituted among men..."

23:10.657 --> 23:13.160
Your Honor,
I object to this removal.

23:13.593 --> 23:14.970
Overruled.

23:15.295 --> 23:17.366
We will make provisions
for the defendant

23:17.430 --> 23:19.432
to observe the
procedures of this court

23:19.766 --> 23:22.042
through closed-circuit television.

23:22.169 --> 23:24.479
You may sit down,
Mr. Christie.

23:29.176 --> 23:31.019
Mr. McCoy,
you may continue.

23:35.282 --> 23:38.729
Did you compare the gunpowder found in Mr.
Christie's basement

23:39.619 --> 23:41.758
to the gunpowder
at the murder scene?

23:41.821 --> 23:45.359
Yes, sir. Both had the same
distinctive chemical composition.

23:45.592 --> 23:47.799
In my opinion, they were
from the same batch.

23:51.064 --> 23:52.099
Thank you.

23:52.165 --> 23:53.166
Do you pay taxes?

23:53.567 --> 23:55.103
JACK: Objection.
Sustained.

23:55.835 --> 23:57.974
Have you ever
read the Constitution

23:58.038 --> 23:59.415
of the United States
of America?

23:59.472 --> 24:01.179
Objection.
Sustained.

24:03.310 --> 24:04.653
(EXCLAIMS)

24:07.347 --> 24:08.587
No more questions.

24:13.954 --> 24:17.800
Yeah, I carried a gun.
But I never thought I'd have to shoot anyone.

24:18.325 --> 24:19.395
It was crazy.
Suddenly...

24:19.459 --> 24:20.563
KUBIE: "That whenever
any form of government..."

24:20.627 --> 24:21.697
JUDGE SCARLETTI:
Order in the court!

24:21.761 --> 24:23.399
"...becomes destructive of these ends...
" I warned you!

24:23.463 --> 24:24.840
"...it is the right of
the people to alter..."

24:24.898 --> 24:26.241
JUDGE SCARLETTI:
Bailiff, remove the defendant!

24:26.299 --> 24:28.074
"...or to abolish it and to..."
Get him out of my court.

24:28.134 --> 24:29.670
"...institute new government
laying its foundation..."

24:29.736 --> 24:30.840
You hear me?
"...on such principles

24:30.904 --> 24:33.612
"and organizing its powers
in such form..."

24:37.043 --> 24:38.579
(KUBIE CONTINUES YELLING)

24:41.848 --> 24:43.452
You were saying, Mr. Parent?

24:44.985 --> 24:47.329
Suddenly,
everybody was shooting.

24:49.522 --> 24:51.524
What do you know about
the new world order?

24:52.626 --> 24:54.469
Before this trial,
I never heard of it.

24:54.527 --> 24:56.006
JACK: Do you work for it?

24:56.296 --> 24:57.434
PARENT: No, sir.

24:57.497 --> 24:59.773
What branch of the
government do you work for?

25:00.700 --> 25:04.375
No branch. I work for the Stevens
Securities Transfer Company.

25:05.071 --> 25:06.414
Thank you.

25:12.012 --> 25:16.290
Mr. Parent, who owns the Stevens
Securities Transfer Company?

25:16.950 --> 25:17.985
I don't know.

25:18.051 --> 25:19.052
Who's on the board?

25:20.887 --> 25:21.888
I don't know.

25:22.322 --> 25:24.700
Could they be working for
a multinational corporation...

25:24.758 --> 25:25.793
Objection.

25:25.859 --> 25:26.860
JUDGE SCARLETTI:
Sustained.

25:27.327 --> 25:28.465
PHIL: How about
New York Bets?

25:28.528 --> 25:29.563
What? Who owns it?

25:31.031 --> 25:32.908
The State, I guess.
New York State?

25:33.900 --> 25:34.901
Yeah.

25:35.001 --> 25:37.607
Do you know who actually
runs New York Bets?

25:38.938 --> 25:40.042
No.

25:40.106 --> 25:41.676
And you didn't vote
for any of them, did you?

25:41.741 --> 25:43.277
Objection.
JUDGE SCARLETTI: Sustained.

25:43.576 --> 25:47.547
Mr. Christie, if you have no relevant
questions, you may sit down.

25:47.647 --> 25:49.820
I have questions
the jury may find relevant.

25:50.917 --> 25:54.694
Your cross-examination is over.
The witness is excused.

26:05.298 --> 26:08.006
KAY: They weren't called
the New Sons of Liberty then.

26:09.536 --> 26:12.949
A few years ago, my brother,
Phil, and my husband

26:13.006 --> 26:14.849
used to sit around
the kitchen table

26:14.908 --> 26:19.220
and talk about how the FBI shot that
woman and her baby at Ruby Ridge,

26:19.746 --> 26:22.226
about how no one in the
government cared about anything

26:22.282 --> 26:24.023
but the special interests.

26:24.084 --> 26:25.529
Special interests?

26:25.685 --> 26:29.155
If you're rich or poor, the
government pays attention.

26:29.522 --> 26:33.060
But the average family in
America doesn't stand a chance.

26:33.760 --> 26:35.433
Like what happened
with my brother

26:35.495 --> 26:38.499
when the government wouldn't let
him see his kids after the divorce

26:38.565 --> 26:41.011
and they gave custody
to his wife.

26:42.102 --> 26:46.642
At any time, did your husband discuss
plans for a robbery with you?

26:48.074 --> 26:54.184
The more involved Matt got with
the group, the angrier he got.

26:55.081 --> 26:58.358
And it wasn't like he was angry
at anything in particular.

26:58.418 --> 27:01.399
It was almost like
he was angry at our life,

27:02.455 --> 27:04.833
at what we had,
at what we didn't have.

27:06.359 --> 27:08.862
After a while, I could
hardly talk to him anymore.

27:10.130 --> 27:15.204
Mrs. Brant, did he ever
talk about a robbery with you?

27:16.870 --> 27:21.216
Matt woke me up one night, after
Phil and the others had been there,

27:21.274 --> 27:26.587
and he told me
they had planned a robbery,

27:28.148 --> 27:31.652
and that he had volunteered
for the mission,

27:31.718 --> 27:33.391
and there was
some danger involved,

27:33.453 --> 27:35.990
and that if
anything happened to him,

27:37.457 --> 27:40.301
he wanted me to know
that he did it for my sake

27:41.394 --> 27:44.898
and for Matt Jr.,
for the country.

27:45.932 --> 27:47.741
JACK: And what did you say?

27:48.802 --> 27:51.043
I told him I didn't understand.

27:52.939 --> 27:54.475
I didn't understand.

27:55.508 --> 27:57.545
The government
wasn't bothering us.

27:57.610 --> 28:00.420
I didn't understand why
they had to commit a crime.

28:05.251 --> 28:06.594
Thank you.

28:23.169 --> 28:24.546
Mrs. Brant,

28:26.806 --> 28:29.582
was your decision to testify
coerced in any way?

28:30.076 --> 28:31.111
Objection.

28:31.177 --> 28:32.383
JUDGE SCARLETTI:
Sustained.

28:34.147 --> 28:35.854
Did Mr. McCoy
offer you anything

28:35.915 --> 28:37.588
in exchange for your testimony?

28:38.218 --> 28:39.288
Objection.

28:39.352 --> 28:40.888
JUDGE SCARLETTI:
Overruled.

28:41.254 --> 28:43.131
Answer the question,
Mrs. Brant.

28:47.594 --> 28:52.600
Mr. McCoy said if I testify,
he'd sever my son's case

28:52.665 --> 28:54.144
and try him on reduced charges.

28:54.200 --> 28:57.204
No! No, Mom!
You shouldn't have done this!

28:57.337 --> 28:59.010
Turning mother and son
against each other.

28:59.072 --> 29:00.176
Order in the court!

29:00.240 --> 29:01.241
Mr. Christie,
please sit down.

29:01.307 --> 29:02.342
Do you think
the American people

29:02.408 --> 29:03.910
are gonna stand by and watch
as you tear a family apart?

29:03.977 --> 29:05.888
JUDGE SCARLETTI: Bailiff, will
you sit the defendant back down?

29:05.945 --> 29:07.982
Remove those defendants!

29:08.047 --> 29:09.355
Remove those defendants!

29:09.415 --> 29:10.450
No!

29:10.583 --> 29:11.891
JUDGE SCARLETTI:
Remove those defendants!

(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)

29:21.127 --> 29:22.970
(CLAMORING CONTINUES)

29:25.857 --> 29:28.838
Christie's master plan.
Look at his witness list.

29:28.994 --> 29:32.100
The directors of the CIA,
the NSA, the President.

29:32.364 --> 29:35.072
The judge excludes them,
Christie yells cover-up.

29:35.233 --> 29:36.906
When you have no case...
JACK: Right.

29:38.436 --> 29:40.939
It leaves him
with just one witness,

29:41.039 --> 29:42.074
himself.

(TELEPHONE RINGING)

Ross. Uh-huh.

29:50.749 --> 29:52.456
We'll be right over.

29:53.852 --> 29:55.490
That was
Judge Scarletti's clerk.

29:55.553 --> 29:57.157
There's a problem
with one of the jurors.

29:57.222 --> 29:58.360
(SCOFFS)

30:01.726 --> 30:03.330
Mr. Shelby, it has
come to my attention

30:03.395 --> 30:07.343
that you passed some reading
material on to another juror.

30:07.866 --> 30:09.504
Yes, sir.
To Bob Clark.

30:10.302 --> 30:11.940
It's a newspaper.

30:12.003 --> 30:14.210
Is this it?
The Crisis.

30:14.272 --> 30:18.482
Yes, sir. It's named after the
newspaper published in 1776.

30:18.877 --> 30:21.915
How would you characterize
this newspaper?

30:25.350 --> 30:29.492
"Our new army at both ends of the
continent is recruiting fast,

30:29.721 --> 30:34.670
"and we shall be able to open the
next campaign with 60,000 men."

30:36.294 --> 30:37.705
isn't this inflammatory?

30:38.930 --> 30:42.343
It's a quote. From Thomas Paine,
one of the founding fathers.

30:43.068 --> 30:45.639
In the voir dire,
you were asked

30:45.704 --> 30:47.012
if you had any opinions

30:47.072 --> 30:50.747
which might prevent you from
judging this case objectively.

30:51.943 --> 30:53.752
I believe I can
judge it objectively.

30:53.812 --> 30:56.850
You told Mr. Clark that you
and some of the other jurors

30:56.915 --> 30:59.395
had made up their minds
to acquit.

31:01.853 --> 31:04.891
You said you wanted
to send a message.

31:06.224 --> 31:08.363
What message
would that be, Mr. Shelby?

31:10.028 --> 31:12.872
In this country, the people and
not the courts are sovereign.

31:13.565 --> 31:14.669
Isn't that right, Your Honor?

31:16.801 --> 31:19.577
Thank you, Mr. Shelby,
you can go.

31:24.376 --> 31:26.652
So, Your Honor, he's dismissed?

31:26.711 --> 31:29.783
Why? He's going to exercise
his right as a citizen

31:29.881 --> 31:32.088
and decide the case
on its merits.

31:32.350 --> 31:35.229
Your Honor, I move you excuse the
entire jury and declare a mistrial.

31:35.353 --> 31:36.593
Because they might acquit?

31:36.654 --> 31:39.260
Because Mr. Shelby is
encouraging them to nullify.

31:39.357 --> 31:42.566
Which is his right
in an illegal trial,

31:42.927 --> 31:44.838
and you've already thrown out
all my co-defendants.

31:44.929 --> 31:46.636
Now you want to
throw out the jury, too?

31:46.865 --> 31:50.608
It's not enough you have the whole
power of government behind you,

31:50.668 --> 31:52.079
you also have to
rig the verdict.

31:52.137 --> 31:54.242
You entered the courtroom with
the presumption of innocence,

31:54.305 --> 31:55.306
just like anyone else.

31:55.373 --> 31:59.321
The rights that I am fighting to
protect are your rights, too.

31:59.411 --> 32:01.288
I can defend my own rights,
Mr. Christie.

32:01.346 --> 32:02.416
Please...

32:02.781 --> 32:05.318
We'll replace Mr. Shelby and Mr.
Clark with alternates.

32:05.784 --> 32:07.354
Your Honor.
Gentlemen.

32:09.554 --> 32:11.727
All that Christie needs
is one hold out.

32:11.790 --> 32:13.565
In the world
of public relations,

32:13.691 --> 32:15.500
a hung jury
is as good as an acquittal.

32:15.894 --> 32:18.636
If we can knock just
one more juror off,

32:18.696 --> 32:21.176
we exhaust the jury pool,
we get a mistrial.

32:21.733 --> 32:23.076
How do you propose we do that?

32:23.668 --> 32:26.478
I think we should find out everything
we can about the other jurors.

32:29.741 --> 32:31.311
I'll talk to
Briscoe and Curtis.

32:31.376 --> 32:35.085
Shady stuff.
This fellow Christie,

32:35.146 --> 32:36.557
he's really
gotten under your skin.

32:36.614 --> 32:37.615
JACK: He's a fanatic.

32:37.682 --> 32:39.161
Because he believes
what he's saying?

32:39.217 --> 32:42.721
When you first applied for a
job here, we had an argument

32:42.987 --> 32:44.591
about some
anti-war protesters.

32:44.656 --> 32:45.794
Oh, come on, Adam.

32:45.857 --> 32:48.098
They broke into a draft board

32:48.159 --> 32:50.036
and poured blood
over the records,

32:50.428 --> 32:51.532
and you defended them.

32:52.797 --> 32:57.246
You said a bad law sometimes
demands an illegal act.

32:57.302 --> 32:59.976
Nobody got killed.

33:00.038 --> 33:02.780
It was a protest and they
took their punishment.

33:09.214 --> 33:14.857
PHIL: I know some of our ideas
sound crazy, or extreme.

33:16.121 --> 33:18.260
I could talk to you about
Ruby Ridge or Waco

33:18.323 --> 33:22.169
or I could tell you how I came
to believe that our government,

33:22.227 --> 33:26.676
a government I was brought up to
love, is a threat to our liberty.

33:27.966 --> 33:30.537
But none of that would
explain what's happened,

33:30.602 --> 33:32.047
why we're on trial here.

33:33.471 --> 33:37.078
The prosecution says we
robbed and murdered.

33:37.842 --> 33:39.981
And that's all
this trial is about.

33:41.980 --> 33:44.654
But let me tell you
how I see it.

33:47.452 --> 33:51.366
Let's say someone
breaks into your house

33:52.690 --> 33:54.169
and they threaten you
and your family...

33:54.225 --> 33:58.401
Your Honor, objection, the defendant
is on the stand as a witness.

33:58.463 --> 33:59.965
This is summation.
Your Honor,

34:00.031 --> 34:01.942
as the counsel for the defense,

34:02.000 --> 34:04.742
I am laying the groundwork
for a line of questioning,

34:05.470 --> 34:08.474
a line of thought that goes
to the heart of my testimony.

34:08.706 --> 34:10.686
I'll give you a little leeway, Mr.
Christie.

34:10.742 --> 34:11.914
Thank you, Your Honor.

34:13.411 --> 34:16.358
So, if you killed someone

34:16.414 --> 34:18.917
who broke into your house
and threatened your family,

34:19.117 --> 34:22.030
most of you would see that
as an act of self-defense.

34:22.453 --> 34:25.092
Now, what if an enemy army
occupies your town,

34:25.356 --> 34:27.927
and what if you and your
neighbors decided to resist...

34:27.992 --> 34:29.027
Objection, Your Honor.

34:29.092 --> 34:30.128
Overruled.

34:30.195 --> 34:31.469
Get to the point,
Mr. Christie.

34:31.529 --> 34:32.563
Okay.

34:32.630 --> 34:34.803
So, what if, as part of
the resistance movement,

34:34.866 --> 34:38.143
you robbed somebody
who was collecting taxes.

34:38.436 --> 34:40.780
Taxes that would
be used to increase

34:40.838 --> 34:42.340
the enemy control
of your town...

34:42.407 --> 34:43.442
Your Honor!

34:43.507 --> 34:45.317
New York Bets is
a scam to collect taxes...

34:45.376 --> 34:46.480
Objection sustained.

34:46.543 --> 34:47.545
...through
a levy on gambling.

34:47.612 --> 34:50.114
Limit yourself to direct testimony, Mr.
Christie.

34:50.181 --> 34:51.181
Your Honor...

34:51.248 --> 34:52.556
I am not going to
allow it, Mr. Christie.

34:52.617 --> 34:54.460
And if I don't knuckle under,
you'll drag me from court, too!

34:54.518 --> 34:55.862
Don't try my patience!

34:55.920 --> 34:57.797
And then who will
be left to defend us?

35:04.162 --> 35:05.300
That's all.

35:10.835 --> 35:15.875
According to Mrs. Brant's testimony,
the night before the robbery,

35:17.275 --> 35:22.452
you met with Matthew Brant, his
son, Thomas Robbins, Lewis Cray,

35:22.714 --> 35:25.661
and half a dozen others.
Is that true?

35:26.217 --> 35:28.993
Did you study the Bushell case
in law school, Mr. McCoy?

35:29.053 --> 35:30.691
Please answer the question.

35:30.755 --> 35:32.666
1670.
The case established

35:32.724 --> 35:33.828
the right for
juries to nullify.

35:33.891 --> 35:34.961
Answer his question,
Mr. Christie.

35:35.026 --> 35:36.630
I am trying, Your Honor.

35:36.828 --> 35:40.241
The right for juries to protect
defendants by finding them not guilty,

35:40.365 --> 35:42.276
evidence of their guilt
notwithstanding.

35:42.333 --> 35:45.576
A right that goes back in
America to John Peter Zenger,

35:45.737 --> 35:48.411
and had been used by black juries
to acquit black defendants

35:48.473 --> 35:50.316
when they had
been tried unfairly.

35:50.408 --> 35:53.321
Mr. Christie, what did you discuss
that night with your co-defendants?

35:53.378 --> 35:55.085
It is a right used
in anti-war cases

35:55.146 --> 35:57.592
and was defended
almost 25 years ago

35:57.649 --> 35:58.992
in an article published...

35:59.050 --> 36:00.654
JACK: Objection.
Non-responsive.

36:00.718 --> 36:03.858
Published by the NYU
law school entitled,

36:04.222 --> 36:07.362
"Jury Nullification in
the Criminal Justice System"

36:07.425 --> 36:08.733
by Jack McCoy.

36:08.793 --> 36:10.295
JUDGE SCARLETTI:
Sustained, Mr. Christie.

36:10.361 --> 36:11.738
You wrote this.

36:14.232 --> 36:17.441
In many ways, you and I
are alike, Mr. McCoy.

36:17.502 --> 36:20.574
No, we're not.
I don't rob armored cars.

36:21.673 --> 36:22.845
You were the third robber,
weren't you?

36:24.342 --> 36:25.685
You killed Walter Wells.

36:33.584 --> 36:35.962
What's the matter,
Mr. Christie?

36:37.689 --> 36:42.638
If you believe what you did was
justified, why won't you answer?

36:47.832 --> 36:49.937
"No person shall be compelled
in any criminal case

36:50.001 --> 36:51.844
"to be a witness
against himself."

36:57.408 --> 36:59.217
No further questions.

36:59.711 --> 37:01.748
JUDGE SCARLETTI: Mr.
Christie, do you have any other witnesses

37:01.813 --> 37:03.053
or evidence to present?

37:03.314 --> 37:07.160
Since you've excluded all of
my witnesses, no, Your Honor.

37:08.986 --> 37:13.867
The defense, the resistance
to tyranny, rests.

37:21.099 --> 37:23.340
I think we've got what we
need to bounce another juror.

37:23.401 --> 37:24.539
Howard Lam m.

37:24.602 --> 37:26.138
The blonde guy
with the glasses.

37:26.404 --> 37:29.385
Late '60s, at Harvard, he was
one of the leaders of the SDS.

37:29.474 --> 37:30.612
A real firebrand.

37:30.675 --> 37:33.246
Implied prejudice
against the government.

37:34.178 --> 37:37.387
Kick Lamm off the jury,
you got your mistrial.

37:38.750 --> 37:40.286
Where'd you get
this information?

37:40.451 --> 37:41.862
Police Red Squad records.

37:41.919 --> 37:43.193
The creeps
who took our pictures

37:43.254 --> 37:45.564
during demonstrations
in the '60s?

37:45.857 --> 37:48.303
These files were supposed
to be destroyed years ago.

37:49.260 --> 37:51.797
Governments are like elephants.
They never forget.

38:04.542 --> 38:05.987
We're not gonna do this.

38:09.981 --> 38:14.487
We're not gonna become the
people Christie thinks we are.

38:26.764 --> 38:30.576
"Tyranny, like hell,
is not easily conquered.

38:32.069 --> 38:35.949
"Yet we have this consolation with
us, that the harder the conflict,

38:36.441 --> 38:38.318
"the more glorious
the triumph."

38:40.978 --> 38:43.356
Tom Paine wrote
that in a pamphlet

38:43.414 --> 38:45.792
that helped rally Americans
to the cause of liberty

38:45.850 --> 38:50.356
in those dark days
of December 1776.

38:51.622 --> 38:53.761
We again face dark days.

38:55.159 --> 38:57.935
Our founding forefathers
fashioned a government

38:57.995 --> 39:02.068
based on life, liberty,
and the pursuit of happiness.

39:03.134 --> 39:08.208
Today, instead of life, we have a
job, we have sometimes two jobs.

39:09.507 --> 39:13.546
Instead of liberty, we have crushing debt.
And happiness?

39:17.548 --> 39:22.429
We work hard, husbands and
wives, 10-12 hours a day.

39:22.720 --> 39:25.496
We work weekends, and at the
end of the week we have less.

39:25.556 --> 39:31.370
We have less real income, less
benefits, less time with our kids.

39:32.763 --> 39:35.403
The American dream used to be,

39:36.501 --> 39:39.209
each generation was better
off than the previous one.

39:40.505 --> 39:42.416
Are you better off
than your parents?

39:43.474 --> 39:45.977
Will your children
be better off than you?

39:47.111 --> 39:51.287
We believe that our government has
been sold to global corporations

39:51.349 --> 39:54.922
that are sucking the blood and
the life out of this country.

39:55.753 --> 39:58.199
It's all right there in the
newspapers, what they're doing.

39:58.623 --> 40:02.662
NAFTA, illegal campaign contributions
by foreign businessmen,

40:02.727 --> 40:04.832
the sale of foreign policy.

40:05.830 --> 40:07.309
These people
don't care about us.

40:07.365 --> 40:08.639
They don't care
about Americans.

40:08.766 --> 40:11.804
They care about
their bottom line.

40:16.707 --> 40:22.555
We are not common criminals. We are...
We are ordinary people like you,

40:22.613 --> 40:26.151
with jobs and mortgages, who are
willing to lay it all on the line

40:26.217 --> 40:28.788
because we are afraid
of losing our freedom.

40:29.320 --> 40:33.769
But today, you have a chance to
tell the government what you think.

40:34.325 --> 40:35.861
Seize that opportunity.

40:36.527 --> 40:38.973
We, the defendants, are not
the only ones on trial here.

40:39.030 --> 40:41.408
You are on trial here.

40:42.800 --> 40:46.009
The State tells you
to follow its laws.

40:46.203 --> 40:49.810
But who lends the State its power?
Who can take it back?

40:51.342 --> 40:55.017
The judge? Mr. McCoy? No.

40:55.880 --> 41:01.762
You do. You are the State.
You have the power.

41:05.423 --> 41:07.425
Freedom starts with a no.

41:08.426 --> 41:12.397
Will you turn to the State
and say no?

41:30.581 --> 41:32.527
Okay. Okay.

41:38.089 --> 41:41.798
This country began as an
experiment in freedom.

41:47.098 --> 41:54.073
The foundation of that freedom
is equality before the law.

41:55.973 --> 42:00.513
Everyone, whoever they are,
whatever they may believe,

42:01.445 --> 42:03.550
must be equally accountable.

42:08.085 --> 42:14.092
Mr. Christie hopes you will
ignore the evidence and nullify.

42:14.825 --> 42:17.669
A power, he says,
derives from a higher law.

42:18.062 --> 42:21.134
I agree that such
a higher law exists.

42:22.333 --> 42:28.011
And each of you, as members of
the jury, bound yourselves to it

42:28.773 --> 42:33.847
when you swore, on your conscience,
before God and as a citizen,

42:34.378 --> 42:37.416
that you would decide
this case on the facts.

42:37.948 --> 42:39.985
You are asked
to judge one thing,

42:41.118 --> 42:44.793
were the defendants, whatever their
reasons, whatever their beliefs,

42:45.022 --> 42:50.404
part of a criminal conspiracy
to commit armed robbery

42:51.328 --> 42:52.807
and murder!

42:56.267 --> 42:59.009
These guys did a great
job of memorization.

42:59.070 --> 43:00.708
Too bad they
didn't learn from it.

43:00.871 --> 43:04.114
We all remember that phrase from
the Declaration of Independence

43:04.175 --> 43:07.588
about life, liberty, and
the pursuit of happiness,

43:07.645 --> 43:11.593
the unalienable
rights of everyone.

43:14.452 --> 43:18.161
Notice that life comes first.

43:20.725 --> 43:22.671
You can forget everything
else about this case,

43:22.727 --> 43:24.866
if you remember one thing,

43:26.330 --> 43:30.870
these defendants, these conspirators,
targeted an ordinary citizen,

43:31.035 --> 43:37.475
someone just like yourselves, a guy
with a job and in the private sector,

43:39.009 --> 43:42.388
with bills to pay and
a family to take care of,

43:43.481 --> 43:44.755
and they took his life.

43:46.684 --> 43:49.255
They took his life!

43:51.756 --> 43:54.930
If it's okay for them
to shoot him,

43:54.992 --> 43:56.596
it's okay for them
to shoot anyone,

43:57.161 --> 43:59.573
including any one of you.

44:02.967 --> 44:05.106
Without the law
there can be no freedom,

44:08.205 --> 44:10.947
and without justice
there can be no law.

44:24.188 --> 44:26.964
Your Honor,
we've been out nine days.

44:27.458 --> 44:31.406
We've had 40 ballots.
We're unable to reach a verdict.

44:35.833 --> 44:39.042
Is there any chance you could
agree if you had more time?

44:41.472 --> 44:42.610
No, Your Honor.

44:48.579 --> 44:49.614
(INHALES DEEPLY)

44:49.680 --> 44:51.421
All right.

44:51.482 --> 44:55.521
Ladies and gentlemen, I have no
choice but to declare a mistrial.

44:56.587 --> 44:57.964
Yes!

44:58.022 --> 44:59.626
The jury is dismissed.

45:00.224 --> 45:03.694
ROBBINS: You did it!
See, see, see.

45:04.461 --> 45:06.441
MAN 1: Hey, man.
MAN 2: All right.

45:10.734 --> 45:13.578
Admit it, McCoy.
We won.

45:14.071 --> 45:17.450
You didn't win anything.
The system you want to destroy won.

45:18.509 --> 45:20.182
See you back here
in a couple of months.

45:20.778 --> 45:22.724
Enjoy your freedom
while you have it.

45:26.016 --> 45:27.723
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

45:27.785 --> 45:29.731
REPORTER: Mr. Christie,
over here.

45:30.588 --> 45:33.865
If he only knew. You could've
sunk this trial and you didn't.

45:34.658 --> 45:38.265
You played it straight, Jack.
That rates as a moral victory.

45:39.363 --> 45:41.001
It could be a hollow one

45:41.966 --> 45:45.277
if those clowns could find even
one person who'd acquit them.

45:45.603 --> 45:47.105
What does that tell you
about this country?

45:47.171 --> 45:49.481
PHIL: We want to thank you
all for being objective

45:49.540 --> 45:51.781
