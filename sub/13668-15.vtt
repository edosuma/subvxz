WEBVTT

00:01.839 --> 00:04.720
And now by the powers vested in me,
I now pronounce you man and wife.

00:04.720 --> 00:05.760
Kiss the bride.

00:05.760 --> 00:07.120
Previously on St Elsewhere...

00:07.120 --> 00:09.200
So you can't work in ER any more.

00:09.200 --> 00:10.680
How would you like
to be stuck down in Pathology?

00:10.680 --> 00:14.680
How would you like
to be stuck down in Pathology?

00:15.080 --> 00:16.400
Tonight on St Elsewhere...

00:16.400 --> 00:17.400
Margaret?

00:17.400 --> 00:20.000
Margaret?

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
She's still very beautiful.

00:22.000 --> 00:25.880
A woman never forgets
the first man she slept with.

00:25.880 --> 00:28.920
The two of us could maybe sit down
with Dr Ridley, Dr Weiss,

00:28.920 --> 00:30.840
and sort of talk things over.

00:30.840 --> 00:32.400
I think we're getting somewhere
here...

00:32.400 --> 00:33.640
I think we're getting somewhere
here...

00:33.640 --> 00:36.560
THEY TALK OVER ONE ANOTHER

00:36.560 --> 00:40.560
I've seen women who resisted and
still got raped come into the ER

00:40.720 --> 00:41.880
beaten to a bloody pulp.

00:41.880 --> 00:45.880
When I saw him coming at me from
the corner, I was ready to kill him.

00:46.040 --> 00:50.040
Who are you?

02:38.400 --> 02:39.680
Just relax, will you?

02:39.680 --> 02:42.600
Stop trying to be a hero.

02:42.600 --> 02:46.600
Where do you want him?

02:49.640 --> 02:53.640
You're all right.

03:02.960 --> 03:04.760
We're going to need
a suture tray, Brenda.

03:04.760 --> 03:06.880
Thank you.

03:06.880 --> 03:08.200
What's your name, sir?

03:08.200 --> 03:10.400
Joseph Keuhnelian.

03:10.400 --> 03:13.560
OK, Mr Keuhnelian,
you just keep your eyes open.

03:13.560 --> 03:16.280
Can you remember what happened?

03:16.280 --> 03:18.960
Yeah. We were topping out
the Wasserman building.

03:18.960 --> 03:21.760
I got sloppy. I took a tumble,
that's all. No big deal.

03:21.760 --> 03:24.160
No big deal? We were 29 stories up.

03:24.160 --> 03:26.800
He was wearing his lifeline,
he must've smacked his head

03:26.800 --> 03:29.480
on a high beam
when he pitched off the side.

03:29.480 --> 03:33.480
Do you feel any tingling
in your arms or legs?

03:33.840 --> 03:37.840
No, no. I'm fine, I'm telling you.
I could have walked in on my own.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.600
Hand me a 50cc syringe,

03:49.600 --> 03:53.200
activated charcoal
and saline solution, please.

03:53.200 --> 03:54.960
Her breathing's very shallow.

03:54.960 --> 03:57.760
And her heartbeat's irregular.
Who knows what she took.

03:57.760 --> 04:00.920
I think we'll need
a urinalysis toxicity screen.

04:00.920 --> 04:04.920
Lights and gases, stat.

04:07.480 --> 04:09.440
Any nausea or vomiting?

04:09.440 --> 04:12.640
I got a little sick, I tell you.

04:12.640 --> 04:14.480
You're going to need a few stitches.

04:14.480 --> 04:17.040
Make it fast, all right, Doc?
I got to get back to work.

04:17.040 --> 04:18.560
I want a Skull Series
and a C-spine.

04:18.560 --> 04:21.399
Come on, there's nothing wrong
with me.

04:21.399 --> 04:24.120
We're going to keep you overnight,
Mr Keuhnelian.

04:24.120 --> 04:26.200
Forget about it.

04:26.200 --> 04:29.280
I've waited in a hiring hole
for six weeks for this job.

04:29.280 --> 04:30.360
I'm lucky to be working.

04:30.360 --> 04:32.960
I'm lucky to be working.

04:32.960 --> 04:34.880
It's just a precaution.

04:34.880 --> 04:38.880
1% lidocaine with epinephrine.

04:39.040 --> 04:42.080
You going to call the hall
for another man?

04:42.080 --> 04:44.480
Er, I can wait. A day or two.

04:44.480 --> 04:45.760
We'll see.

04:45.760 --> 04:48.520
Thanks.

04:48.520 --> 04:52.520
It's changed my life, Peter.
I've never felt so focused,

04:52.840 --> 04:56.040
so full of energy, so inspired.

04:56.040 --> 05:00.040
You get the extract in the form
of a rich, aromatic paste.

05:00.160 --> 05:01.480
Huh?

05:01.480 --> 05:05.480
Tibetan ginseng. A mysterious herb
that increases the body's resistance

05:06.480 --> 05:08.720
to adverse factors of all kinds.

05:08.720 --> 05:10.240
Oh, yeah?

05:10.240 --> 05:13.480
Um, next time, start the
mid line incision a little higher.

05:13.480 --> 05:17.480
I guess I won't make
county coroner, will I?

05:21.800 --> 05:25.240
This guy's got
a sternum like a two by four.

05:25.240 --> 05:28.880
According to legend, ginseng was
first cultivated by Zen monks

05:28.880 --> 05:32.880
in the Himalayan meadows,
and used as a sacrament.

05:33.720 --> 05:36.840
These days, only the Russians
are aware of its potential.

05:36.840 --> 05:40.120
It's in a group of substances called
adaptogens,

05:40.120 --> 05:42.320
do you know that in one experiment

05:42.320 --> 05:46.320
they even found that it reduces
sterility in minks.

05:47.160 --> 05:48.720
CRASH

05:48.720 --> 05:50.520
I'm sorry.

05:50.520 --> 05:54.520
Peter, those were my IPD stains,
that was six weeks of work.

05:54.560 --> 05:56.000
I'll help you replace them.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.080
Sure.

05:57.080 --> 05:59.520
It's these damn shoes,
they're slippery.

05:59.520 --> 06:03.520
How could you be so...?

06:04.080 --> 06:05.200
Are you all right?

06:05.200 --> 06:09.200
I'm fine, everything's great.

06:12.440 --> 06:13.720
Peter?

06:13.720 --> 06:17.680
Leave me alone now, Kathy.

06:17.680 --> 06:21.680
I'm going for a walk.

06:25.120 --> 06:28.440
Hi, Victor, welcome back,
you look great.

06:28.440 --> 06:29.000
How was the honeymoon?

06:29.000 --> 06:30.040
How was the honeymoon?

06:30.040 --> 06:31.920
Great, your assistant
made three o'clock, don't forget.

06:31.920 --> 06:35.920
Great, your assistant
made three o'clock, don't forget.

06:37.600 --> 06:38.400
Hi.

06:38.400 --> 06:39.440
Hi.

06:39.440 --> 06:41.520
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to scare you.

06:41.520 --> 06:44.800
No, I'm all right.
Good to have you back, Victor.

06:44.800 --> 06:46.320
Thanks. What's all this about?

06:46.320 --> 06:48.280
A woman was raped in
the parking lot last week.

06:48.280 --> 06:49.320
You're kidding?

06:49.320 --> 06:52.400
Two nights ago, someone grabbed a
pharmacist on her way to the T,

06:52.400 --> 06:54.120
she managed to get away.

06:54.120 --> 06:56.560
Welcome back to life
in the big city, Victor.

06:56.560 --> 06:58.040
Yeah.

06:58.040 --> 07:00.640
Boy, look at you,
skin cleared up and everything.

07:00.640 --> 07:01.920
Oh, take it easy, please.

07:01.920 --> 07:03.000
So, how did it go?

07:03.000 --> 07:04.720
It was fantastic, not a cloud
in the sky,

07:04.720 --> 07:06.640
you should see what
it did to Roberta's hair,

07:06.640 --> 07:07.880
I mean, the sun, it got through it.

07:07.880 --> 07:10.080
I mean, the sun, it got through it.

07:10.080 --> 07:12.280
Oh, it was well worth the wait,
let me put it that way.

07:12.280 --> 07:15.200
There is not a woman alive who is
worth waiting that long for.

07:15.200 --> 07:18.000
By the way, I got your wedding
present back from the cleaners,

07:18.000 --> 07:20.320
suppose if I drop by Friday for a
home cooked meal,

07:20.320 --> 07:21.400
I can give it to you then.

07:21.400 --> 07:23.800
Sure thing, actually, now that
you mention it, you know,

07:23.800 --> 07:24.800
we'd be free tonight if you...

07:24.800 --> 07:25.960
we'd be free tonight if you...

07:25.960 --> 07:27.520
Well, Friday would be perfect then.

07:27.520 --> 07:28.320
7.30?

07:28.320 --> 07:29.480
7.30?

07:29.480 --> 07:31.320
Mrs Ryan was admitted this morning

07:31.320 --> 07:35.320
with symptoms of congestive heart
failure, multi focal PVCs.

07:35.640 --> 07:38.800
I performed a lavage
as a precautionary measure.

07:38.800 --> 07:40.840
Why was the stomach lavage
indicated?

07:40.840 --> 07:43.400
The patient was a said to have
been dizzy and disoriented.

07:43.400 --> 07:47.400
Because I was puking
my guts out, Danny.

07:48.240 --> 07:51.040
This is a hell of a way to hold
a reunion, isn't it?

07:51.040 --> 07:52.240
Margaret?

07:52.240 --> 07:55.640
I don't know how you did it,
but you look wonderful.

07:55.640 --> 07:59.640
This is remarkable, Mrs Ryan
and I were friends 45 years ago.

08:00.960 --> 08:02.560
When did you lose you hair?

08:02.560 --> 08:05.320
World War II,
give or take a few years.

08:05.320 --> 08:08.200
He used to have
this thick head of hair,

08:08.200 --> 08:11.120
at least he's kept his figure.

08:11.120 --> 08:12.520
How are you, Margaret?

08:12.520 --> 08:15.840
You're the one with the charts,
so you tell me.

08:15.840 --> 08:17.560
I meant, how's your life?

08:17.560 --> 08:18.640
Oh.

08:18.640 --> 08:20.720
The lab studies are still pending?

08:20.720 --> 08:24.360
Yes, lights and gasses indicated
respiratory and metabolic acidosis,

08:24.360 --> 08:27.040
we're still waiting
for the urine toxicity screen.

08:27.040 --> 08:28.200
Fine, fine.

08:28.200 --> 08:31.480
Her stomach contents contained
ingested pills.

08:31.480 --> 08:34.120
Your medical history shows mild
congestive heart disease

08:34.120 --> 08:35.280
and high blood pressure.

08:35.280 --> 08:39.280
We need all your medical records,
you have a physician in town?

08:39.520 --> 08:40.760
Slews of them.

08:40.760 --> 08:44.760
I need to feel your pulse.

08:52.840 --> 08:55.200
The bigeminy seems to have
absolved itself.

08:55.200 --> 08:59.000
I don't know what that means,
but I'm glad to hear it.

08:59.000 --> 09:02.160
And her blood pressure is slightly
lower, 160 over 80.

09:02.160 --> 09:03.440
So, we're waiting on the lab?

09:03.440 --> 09:04.840
Yes.

09:04.840 --> 09:07.160
We have to go now, complete rounds,

09:07.160 --> 09:11.160
but I'll return later and personally
give you the results of the test.

09:11.280 --> 09:15.280
Danny, is the somewhere around here
I could get a good back rub?

09:22.240 --> 09:23.520
Hi, Roberta.

09:23.520 --> 09:26.560
I'm sorry, I just wanted to make
sure I caught you before you left.

09:26.560 --> 09:29.200
Listen, I wanted to be sure
and say Friday evening,

09:29.200 --> 09:32.640
yeah, I invited
Wayne over for dinner.

09:32.640 --> 09:34.720
No, no, no, I'm not bored with you,

09:34.720 --> 09:38.120
I just think it's important for us
to see other people once in a while.

09:38.120 --> 09:41.840
Um, 7.30.

09:41.840 --> 09:45.840
Well, could you maybe leave work
a little early for once?

09:48.120 --> 09:50.200
No, no, I didn't say that,

09:50.200 --> 09:54.200
I think your job is every
bit as important as mine.

09:55.040 --> 09:57.240
I do not hate your roast beef!

09:57.240 --> 10:01.240
Tell me, please, what in heaven's
name does roast beef...?

10:03.680 --> 10:07.680
Yeah, yeah, I love you too,
sweetheart, bye bye.

10:31.640 --> 10:32.760
Mrs Rosenthal?

10:32.760 --> 10:34.480
Yes, honey?

10:34.480 --> 10:36.440
I lost Mr Fletcher's juice.

10:36.440 --> 10:40.440
You lost it, well, never mind, dear,
we'll just get him some more.

10:42.200 --> 10:44.480
I didn't mean to,
I was trying to hurry,

10:44.480 --> 10:46.560
I got off on the wrong floor
then I got lost.

10:46.560 --> 10:48.640
Yeah, I'll hold.
Mr Benton, room 316.

10:48.640 --> 10:51.920
Then I went past this empty supply
room and some guy called out

10:51.920 --> 10:54.400
and asked if I would hold
the flash light for him

10:54.400 --> 10:56.040
when he changed the light bulb.

10:56.040 --> 10:58.440
And...

10:58.440 --> 11:02.440
..it was, uh,
I guess it was burned out and so...

11:02.560 --> 11:05.920
I went in and I saw that he
was wearing a ski mask

11:05.920 --> 11:09.920
and then he shut the door
and I couldn't see anything.

11:14.640 --> 11:18.640
And I tried to cry out be he said if
I said anything he'd really hurt me.

11:19.080 --> 11:21.360
And I tried to cry out be he said if
I said anything he'd really hurt me.

11:21.360 --> 11:25.360
Oh, it hurt so much.

11:26.480 --> 11:30.480
He's gone now, sweetie,
I'm right here to take care of you.

11:35.880 --> 11:38.640
I've been walking in and out of this
hospital

11:38.640 --> 11:40.120
for months without any question.

11:40.120 --> 11:41.440
We put in a call to personnel,

11:41.440 --> 11:43.560
you'll just have to wait till
they clear you.

11:43.560 --> 11:45.520
See, I am not
an employee of the hospital,

11:45.520 --> 11:46.440
that's what I'm trying to explain.

11:46.440 --> 11:47.880
that's what I'm trying to explain.

11:47.880 --> 11:49.440
Russell, she's here to see me,

11:49.440 --> 11:52.040
we're checking the IDs of everyone
who comes in to the hospital.

11:52.040 --> 11:53.520
we're checking the IDs of everyone
who comes in to the hospital.

11:53.520 --> 11:54.680
Sorry.

11:54.680 --> 11:56.600
Why the extra precautions
all of a sudden?

11:56.600 --> 11:59.320
Another rape, I closed down all
the unnecessary exits,

11:59.320 --> 12:01.280
I've sent all the underage
volunteers home.

12:01.280 --> 12:05.280
Well, that's it, starting tomorrow
there'll be undercover detectives

12:05.960 --> 12:07.920
in the hospital
working as orderlies.

12:07.920 --> 12:11.360
I can't help wondering if it isn't
some disgruntled former employee,

12:11.360 --> 12:12.520
someone who got the axe,

12:12.520 --> 12:15.320
like that janitor in Cleveland
who started all the fires.

12:15.320 --> 12:17.000
Have personnel pull a list together

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
of everyone who's been
terminated in the last year.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.480
of everyone who's been
terminated in the last year.

12:20.480 --> 12:22.440
What about a list of former
patients?

12:22.440 --> 12:24.600
The police could run
a check for criminal records.

12:24.600 --> 12:27.680
No, that would be
a violation of confidentiality.

12:27.680 --> 12:29.360
At least a list
of psych ward patients?

12:29.360 --> 12:33.360
No, no, it's out
of the question, Joan.

12:37.120 --> 12:38.600
Amanda.

12:38.600 --> 12:39.640
Phil.

12:39.640 --> 12:42.000
Listen,
what are you doing Saturday night?

12:42.000 --> 12:45.120
I've got two tickets for a Smokey
Robinson concert at the Midtown,

12:45.120 --> 12:46.720
I was wondering if...?

12:46.720 --> 12:50.720
I'd love to,
but it's my father's birthday.

12:52.360 --> 12:55.120
I'll keep trying.

12:55.120 --> 12:57.760
The thing that really frightens me
about these creeps

12:57.760 --> 13:01.320
is that they rape again and again,
even after a stretch in jail.

13:01.320 --> 13:04.960
They ought to dose them
with that new drug, you know,

13:04.960 --> 13:07.120
the one they found that blocks
the sex drive.

13:07.120 --> 13:07.760
Depo-Provera?

13:07.760 --> 13:08.800
Depo-Provera?

13:08.800 --> 13:11.280
Some of the side effects
can be pretty horrendous.

13:11.280 --> 13:13.040
Lowering the testosterone level

13:13.040 --> 13:15.800
doesn't automatically stop
assaulting behaviour.

13:15.800 --> 13:19.520
Then they ought to castrate them.

13:19.520 --> 13:23.200
Cruel and unusual punishment.

13:23.200 --> 13:24.560
I'm all for it.

13:24.560 --> 13:28.000
(HIGH PITCHED VOICE) Well, so much
for the side effects.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.280
Fiscus.

13:30.280 --> 13:33.240
Dr Kenneth Penny, 6748,

13:33.240 --> 13:37.240
Dr Huffman, Dr Sam Huffman, 4792.

13:37.720 --> 13:40.120
Now, Roberta,
you're going to sit right there

13:40.120 --> 13:42.320
until you tell me
what the matter is.

13:42.320 --> 13:43.360
It's kind of personal.

13:43.360 --> 13:45.960
Oh, you can trust me,

13:45.960 --> 13:49.920
I mean, I spend my whole day in the
middle of other people's business,

13:49.920 --> 13:53.920
I haven't spilled
the beans yet, now, what happened?

13:54.000 --> 13:56.960
You and your husband
had your first fight?

13:56.960 --> 13:58.160
I guess so.

13:58.160 --> 13:59.640
You don't know?

13:59.640 --> 14:03.080
No, see,
that's it, I really don't know.

14:03.080 --> 14:06.040
It's like, well, I was opening up
wedding presents last night,

14:06.040 --> 14:09.120
you know you get a warranty and an
instruction booklet with everything?

14:09.120 --> 14:10.160
Yeah.

14:10.160 --> 14:10.760
PHONE BUZZES

14:10.760 --> 14:13.080
PHONE BUZZES

14:13.080 --> 14:14.640
Operator?

14:14.640 --> 14:18.640
No, he's not in, yeah,
I can take a message, go ahead.

14:21.040 --> 14:22.720
Yeah, yes.

14:22.720 --> 14:24.240
Can you get me another pen?

14:24.240 --> 14:27.440
Well, yes, sir, but...

14:27.440 --> 14:30.400
I know, but that's not my
responsibility.

14:30.400 --> 14:32.960
I'll give him the message,
thank you very much, yes.

14:32.960 --> 14:36.480
All right, all right.

14:36.480 --> 14:38.040
Now, what were you saying?

14:38.040 --> 14:42.040
Well, when I looked at Victor this
morning, all I could think was,

14:42.200 --> 14:45.360
why didn't I get an instruction
booklet with him?

14:45.360 --> 14:48.320
I'm really starting to wish none
of this had ever happened,

14:48.320 --> 14:50.920
before we got married
I figured that if I got in trouble

14:50.920 --> 14:52.080
I could call my mother.

14:52.080 --> 14:54.680
My mother walks in ten minutes
before the wedding

14:54.680 --> 14:56.600
and tells me
she never loved my father.

14:56.600 --> 14:57.640
Oh, brother.

14:57.640 --> 15:00.440
I always thought my father
was a really nice person.

15:00.440 --> 15:04.080
You mean, Victor isn't?

15:04.080 --> 15:08.080
You know,
he can be a real jackass sometimes.

15:08.360 --> 15:11.560
Cleft pallet shows a complete
palatine separation,

15:11.560 --> 15:15.560
we'll be in there a couple of hours.

15:15.720 --> 15:19.280
Have you ever seen him
with his glasses off?

15:19.280 --> 15:23.280
Ehrlich, I would like to get this
done by sun down.

15:23.720 --> 15:27.120
Roberta, honey, is everything
working out for you two,

15:27.120 --> 15:29.160
you know, between the sheets?

15:29.160 --> 15:32.400
This is terrible.
Come on, Fiscus.

15:32.400 --> 15:34.520
Well...

15:34.520 --> 15:36.600
Come on, Roberta.

15:36.600 --> 15:39.160
I guess he's having a good time.

15:39.160 --> 15:42.680
What really bothers me is that every
time after we finish making love

15:42.680 --> 15:45.880
he always says,
"Boy, am I glad I got you."

15:45.880 --> 15:48.880
Like I'm some kind of sports
car or something.

15:48.880 --> 15:51.360
Then he just falls asleep.

15:51.360 --> 15:54.400
PHONE BUZZES

15:54.400 --> 15:56.000
Operator?

15:56.000 --> 16:00.000
Yes, Nurse Daniels.

16:07.200 --> 16:09.960
Mr Keuhnelian in 309.

16:09.960 --> 16:12.400
Oh, the guy who did the half
canter off the high rise?

16:12.400 --> 16:15.240
Yeah, the skull series
and the C-spine are both negative.

16:15.240 --> 16:17.600
But I'd like to get
neuro checks every other hour.

16:17.600 --> 16:18.840
Sure.

16:18.840 --> 16:21.800
Sounds to me like you can't find
anything wrong with him.

16:21.800 --> 16:23.600
Right.

16:23.600 --> 16:25.280
His family are visiting, aren't they?

16:25.280 --> 16:29.280
Do you want to go talk to the mother?

16:29.320 --> 16:31.360
Sure.

16:31.360 --> 16:32.680
If anything changes, let me know.

16:32.680 --> 16:36.680
If anything changes, let me know.

16:37.760 --> 16:40.400
Mrs Keuhnelian? I'm Dr Morrison.

16:40.400 --> 16:42.680
Is my son all right?
Nobody will tell me.

16:42.680 --> 16:44.160
Joseph has concussion.

16:44.160 --> 16:48.160
He's in no danger at present
but we're keeping him in over night,

16:48.280 --> 16:52.280
observations, tests, pretty much
standard in cases like this.

16:53.080 --> 16:54.320
He was very lucky.

16:54.320 --> 16:55.440
I've got to see him.

16:55.440 --> 16:58.320
OK, just for a minute.

16:58.320 --> 17:00.800
He's down the hall, room 309.

17:00.800 --> 17:04.800
We'll meet here, Lynnie.

17:05.160 --> 17:06.520
Are you Joseph's wife?

17:06.520 --> 17:09.760
I'm his sister.

17:09.760 --> 17:12.280
You can visit him too, if you want.

17:12.280 --> 17:16.280
I'll hold the baby, I'm an old pro.

17:16.920 --> 17:18.240
No.

17:18.240 --> 17:22.240
Is he hungry?

17:22.359 --> 17:24.040
Well, come on,

17:24.040 --> 17:26.400
let's see if we can find
some place a little more private

17:26.400 --> 17:30.400
where you can nurse him.

17:35.840 --> 17:39.560
I need a reposition for a liver
spleen scan on Mrs Curtis.

17:39.560 --> 17:40.640
OK.

17:40.640 --> 17:43.960
Oh, Victor, I was awfully sorry to
hear about your honeymoon.

17:43.960 --> 17:44.560
Thanks.

17:44.560 --> 17:47.080
Thanks.

17:47.080 --> 17:49.240
after all,
I've been there once or twice.

17:49.240 --> 17:50.480
I really appreciate that.

17:50.480 --> 17:54.480
Things are always a little ragged
when you're starting off.

17:54.680 --> 17:57.080
Wayne,
could I talk to you for a second?

17:57.080 --> 17:59.440
Victor, I want you to know how much

17:59.440 --> 18:02.120
I admire your courage in showing
your face around here.

18:02.120 --> 18:03.440
What's going on around here?

18:03.440 --> 18:05.520
I come out of a gruelling
operation downstairs

18:05.520 --> 18:08.240
and this place has turned into
the Twilight Zone.

18:08.240 --> 18:09.520
Wait a second, you were in OR?

18:09.520 --> 18:10.560
Yeah.

18:10.560 --> 18:11.600
Then you didn't hear it.

18:11.600 --> 18:12.720
Then you didn't hear it.

18:12.720 --> 18:16.720
Uh, step into my office.

18:18.440 --> 18:20.320
Is Freddy still with us?

18:20.320 --> 18:22.440
He's still with us
but he's not with me,

18:22.440 --> 18:26.440
I divorced him 15 years ago.

18:26.520 --> 18:30.520
I've thought of you,
on and off, for the last 45 years.

18:33.480 --> 18:35.120
You know, it's true what they say,

18:35.120 --> 18:39.120
a woman never forgets
the first man she slept with.

18:39.920 --> 18:42.120
I don't have your lab results yet,

18:42.120 --> 18:46.120
but from the looks of you,

18:47.680 --> 18:50.920
you're still a very beautiful woman.

18:50.920 --> 18:54.920
You always tried to take advantage
of a woman when she's lying down.

18:55.960 --> 18:57.320
Are you married?

18:57.320 --> 18:58.680
Yeah.

18:58.680 --> 18:59.920
Any pictures?

18:59.920 --> 19:03.920
Yes, we took some at Thanksgiving.

19:04.400 --> 19:08.000
These are of Catherine,
the children and the grand children.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.640
Oh, she's very attractive.

19:10.640 --> 19:12.160
And what about you?

19:12.160 --> 19:14.280
Two sons, two daughters,
they're fabulous,

19:14.280 --> 19:18.280
now and then half of them speak to me
but it's always a different half.

19:18.520 --> 19:22.520
Now, I know what happened to your
hair, you gave it to your grandson.

19:25.920 --> 19:27.520
I knew you'd make a good mother,

19:27.520 --> 19:30.440
the way you were always taking
care of everyone.

19:30.440 --> 19:34.440
And now here you are,
taking care of me.

19:35.520 --> 19:38.920
There are enough doctors here
to form a baseball team,

19:38.920 --> 19:40.440
why is it you never called on me?

19:40.440 --> 19:43.280
Well, you remember,

19:43.280 --> 19:46.440
I was around during your
first year in medical school,

19:46.440 --> 19:50.440
and quite honestly, with
your haphazard methods of studying,

19:50.680 --> 19:53.520
I never thought you'd turn out to
be any good, as a doctor, I mean.

19:53.520 --> 19:57.520
Well, that's not true,
I studied all the time,

19:57.680 --> 20:00.520
there never was a more
dedicated student.

20:00.520 --> 20:02.880
You must be suffering
from hardening of the arteries

20:02.880 --> 20:04.360
because your memory is going.

20:04.360 --> 20:06.640
There's nothing the matter
with my arteries.

20:06.640 --> 20:09.720
It was around Christmas time,
you were hysterical,

20:09.720 --> 20:12.120
your histology final,
you were praying all the time.

20:12.120 --> 20:13.440
your histology final,
you were praying all the time.

20:13.440 --> 20:17.320
"God, please, don't fail me,
I know I never went to class,

20:17.320 --> 20:19.120
"but it will never happen again."

20:19.120 --> 20:22.960
Now, why would I remember a thing
like that after all these years?

20:22.960 --> 20:25.520
I mean, I don't even
know what histology is.

20:25.520 --> 20:28.400
I don't want to get in to
an argument about this.

20:28.400 --> 20:32.280
But if it is true, it's your fault.

20:32.280 --> 20:35.120
Dragging me off to
Greenwich Village all the time

20:35.120 --> 20:37.400
to meet those oddball friends
of yours.

20:37.400 --> 20:39.400
Not oddball, avant garde.

20:39.400 --> 20:41.160
Sitting around to all hours,

20:41.160 --> 20:43.440
talking, drinking, talking,
drinking.

20:43.440 --> 20:46.440
talking, drinking, talking,
drinking.

20:46.440 --> 20:49.400
Obviously,
you lived your whole life that way.

20:49.400 --> 20:51.760
Because you're certainly paying
the price for it now.

20:51.760 --> 20:53.880
I thought this was to be
a social call.

20:53.880 --> 20:56.400
I'm serious.

20:56.400 --> 21:00.400
It's important at our age not
to let ourselves go.

21:00.520 --> 21:03.520
The trouble with you, Daniel,
was that you never let yourself go.

21:03.520 --> 21:05.000
You never took any chances.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.520
It was a different time,

21:07.520 --> 21:11.080
in a different world.

21:11.080 --> 21:13.920
You know it.

21:13.920 --> 21:16.800
You still have that uncanny
knack of saying exactly the thing

21:16.800 --> 21:19.400
that drives me
right out of the room.

21:19.400 --> 21:21.200
Some things never change,

21:21.200 --> 21:25.200
you've still got
that cute, little rear end.

21:27.600 --> 21:30.320
What do you want, you want
me to publish a formal retraction?

21:30.320 --> 21:31.680
This would have never happened

21:31.680 --> 21:34.000
if I'd listened to that
little voice deep inside of me.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.840
That voice kept saying it was
a big mistake

21:35.840 --> 21:37.920
for us to get married
and keep working at the same place.

21:37.920 --> 21:40.440
for us to get married
and keep working at the same place.

21:40.440 --> 21:42.480
Oh, yeah, babe, tell me about it.

21:42.480 --> 21:46.480
Victor, I don't want
you to pay for my lunch.

21:47.400 --> 21:49.400
Well, the only problem with a
real weapon

21:49.400 --> 21:52.080
is that the rapist could
grab it and use it against you.

21:52.080 --> 21:53.680
Yeah, but not these.

21:53.680 --> 21:55.840
See.

21:55.840 --> 21:57.240
I don't buy it, Wendy.

21:57.240 --> 21:58.280
Why not?

21:58.280 --> 21:59.680
The more you struggle,

21:59.680 --> 22:02.200
the greater your chances of getting
seriously hurt.

22:02.200 --> 22:05.000
I've seen women who resisted
and still got raped

22:05.000 --> 22:07.520
come in to the ER
beaten to a bloody pulp.

22:07.520 --> 22:09.680
Does that make them
some kind of hero?

22:09.680 --> 22:12.000
So, what are you going to do,
just lie back and take it?

22:12.000 --> 22:16.000
Of course not, I'd try and con him,
reason with him, stall for time.

22:18.440 --> 22:19.920
What would you do, Helen?

22:19.920 --> 22:21.840
I don't know,
there are a lot of strategies,

22:21.840 --> 22:23.880
depends on the rapist,
the circumstances,

22:23.880 --> 22:27.120
but I'll tell you one thing, I'm not
going to do a lot of planning for it.

22:27.120 --> 22:30.040
The more I rearrange my life to
avoid this maniac,

22:30.040 --> 22:32.120
the more power I'm giving him
over me, right?

22:32.120 --> 22:34.600
Fine, if it comes right down to it,

22:34.600 --> 22:36.440
I'm fighting back with everything
I've got.

22:36.440 --> 22:38.680
I'm fighting back with everything
I've got.

22:38.680 --> 22:41.160
You have to live with yourself
after it's over, Jackie.

22:41.160 --> 22:43.160
From what I've read,
women who put up a struggle

22:43.160 --> 22:45.760
are far less likely to be
chronically depressed afterwards

22:45.760 --> 22:47.720
than if they'd
offered no resistance at all.

22:47.720 --> 22:51.720
If they live through it.

22:55.000 --> 22:58.000
I always scratch my name on a high
beam some where,

22:58.000 --> 23:01.800
no one's going to ever see it,
but I know it's there.

23:01.800 --> 23:03.160
Well, it must be a nice feeling

23:03.160 --> 23:05.320
when you have a hand building
something like that.

23:05.320 --> 23:08.600
Yeah, it's a nice feeling, it's
a nice feeling when you get paid.

23:08.600 --> 23:10.760
It's hell up there.

23:10.760 --> 23:13.080
A lot of guys to go pieces.

23:13.080 --> 23:14.840
Almost done, Mr Keuhnelian.

23:14.840 --> 23:18.840
When can he come home, Doctor?

23:19.520 --> 23:22.440
Well,
there's no neurological problems,

23:22.440 --> 23:25.000
looks like your came
out of it in excellent shape.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.960
Thank you, Doctor.

23:26.960 --> 23:28.320
Let me go get the release forms,

23:28.320 --> 23:32.320
you can get out of here first
thing tomorrow morning.

23:36.880 --> 23:38.480
Good doctor, right?

23:38.480 --> 23:39.760
He's a nice guy.

23:39.760 --> 23:43.440
I was so afraid something was really
wrong with you, Joseph.

23:43.440 --> 23:46.760
And if there was,
I don't know what we would do.

23:46.760 --> 23:48.000
It's nice to be needed, Ma.

23:48.000 --> 23:50.840
Everything costs too much
these days,

23:50.840 --> 23:54.840
what with Lynnie and the baby,
and Carl walking out on them,

23:55.040 --> 23:56.560
you are our only hope.

23:56.560 --> 23:58.880
you are our only hope.

23:58.880 --> 24:00.840
I know you hate
working in construction but...

24:00.840 --> 24:02.600
I know you hate
working in construction but...

24:02.600 --> 24:06.560
I'll be up there first
thing in the morning.

24:06.560 --> 24:09.920
OK, Mr Keuhnelian,
I need you to sign this.

24:09.920 --> 24:10.960
OK.

24:10.960 --> 24:13.480
Sign right there.

24:13.480 --> 24:16.200
No construction work for a few
weeks, you hear me?

24:16.200 --> 24:18.800
That's not possible. They'll
give his job to somebody else.

24:18.800 --> 24:22.440
I hear you.

24:22.440 --> 24:24.880
You'll be feeling some pain in your
neck and shoulders for a while.

24:24.880 --> 24:28.880
You'll be feeling some pain in your
neck and shoulders for a while.

24:30.120 --> 24:32.080
What's happening?

24:32.080 --> 24:33.440
Would you get the cardio stack?

24:33.440 --> 24:34.840
What's going on?

24:34.840 --> 24:36.400
What is it, what's going on?

24:36.400 --> 24:39.960
Hart's coming, want me to start CPR?

24:39.960 --> 24:41.600
No, he's got a pulse.

24:41.600 --> 24:43.880
I can't see!

24:43.880 --> 24:45.760
Pulse is strong and regular.

24:45.760 --> 24:46.800
Forget the cart.

24:46.800 --> 24:48.720
I can't see!

24:48.720 --> 24:52.040
Do something, help him, please.

24:52.040 --> 24:55.400
We're starting with some pepyrin
and call radiology for an angiogram.

24:55.400 --> 24:56.280
What's going on, Doctor?

24:56.280 --> 25:00.280
What's going on, Doctor?

25:02.040 --> 25:03.040
Joseph, I'm here.

25:03.040 --> 25:04.080
Joseph, I'm here.

25:04.080 --> 25:05.760
I'm here, Joseph.

25:05.760 --> 25:09.760
God, please, help me.

25:13.120 --> 25:16.200
Now, so far, the attacks seem to be
completely at random.

25:16.200 --> 25:19.360
The parking lot,
Bowen Street T-stop,

25:19.360 --> 25:22.000
and of course, as you all know most
recently, the supply room.

25:22.000 --> 25:25.040
This guy picks a place and waits.

25:25.040 --> 25:27.280
That's why these reminders are
so important.

25:27.280 --> 25:31.280
Be alert, if you see anyone, oh,
hanging around in the hallways,

25:32.280 --> 25:36.080
empty rooms, call us immediately.

25:36.080 --> 25:38.120
People hang around in the hallways
all the time.

25:38.120 --> 25:39.920
People hang around in the hallways
all the time.

25:39.920 --> 25:43.920
That's why lions sleep in trees.

25:50.600 --> 25:53.480
Annie?

25:53.480 --> 25:55.400
I've been looking all over for you.

25:55.400 --> 25:58.440
It'll have to be fast,
I'm already late for a meeting.

25:58.440 --> 26:01.600
What I want to say is,

26:01.600 --> 26:03.360
I guess I came on a little strong
the other night.

26:03.360 --> 26:04.680
I guess I came on a little strong
the other night.

26:04.680 --> 26:07.280
I'm sorry.

26:07.280 --> 26:09.720
It's too much wine and other things,

26:09.720 --> 26:13.000
I guess I've been dragging home
a lot of aggravation

26:13.000 --> 26:15.720
from the hospital.

26:15.720 --> 26:18.240
I just didn't mean to seem
so insensitive.

26:18.240 --> 26:19.360
Insensitive?

26:19.360 --> 26:21.920
Chris, I was there, you attacked me.

26:21.920 --> 26:23.400
It won't happen again.

26:23.400 --> 26:24.520
That's for sure.

26:24.520 --> 26:25.720
Wait a second, let me.

26:25.720 --> 26:26.480
Wait a second, let me.

26:26.480 --> 26:30.400
Why won't you just...

26:30.400 --> 26:34.400
To hell with you.

26:37.680 --> 26:41.360
The victim usually perceives the
attack as a life or death situation.

26:41.360 --> 26:44.920
But in fact, even though
they get most of the publicity,

26:44.920 --> 26:48.920
the psychotic rapists, the ones who
really want to kill their victims

26:49.040 --> 26:51.280
are just a very small minority,

26:51.280 --> 26:53.120
somewhere around two percent.

26:53.120 --> 26:54.400
I was wondering, what...

26:54.400 --> 26:55.880
I was wondering, what...

26:55.880 --> 26:58.960
While we're talking,
I'd like to pass these out.

26:58.960 --> 27:02.600
If you do get into trouble,
these things are pretty loud,

27:02.600 --> 27:04.600
good chance they'll
scare off whoever it is.

27:04.600 --> 27:07.120
HIGH PITCHED SQUEAK

27:07.120 --> 27:08.080
Go ahead.

27:08.080 --> 27:09.480
Go ahead.

27:09.480 --> 27:12.080
like we've blown the whole
situation out of proportion.

27:12.080 --> 27:13.880
I never intended that.

27:13.880 --> 27:15.840
I just don't think that
getting hysterical...

27:15.840 --> 27:18.400
We're not hysterical,
but all you've done is tell us

27:18.400 --> 27:20.840
what  we  have to do,
the precautions that  we  have to take.

27:20.840 --> 27:22.480
What's being
done about stopping this man?

27:22.480 --> 27:25.080
What's being
done about stopping this man?

27:25.080 --> 27:26.520
At this point,

27:26.520 --> 27:29.480
the police still don't have
anything specific to go on.

27:29.480 --> 27:32.280
In other words, nothing's being done.

27:32.280 --> 27:35.160
We're trying to provide you
with as much protection as possible.

27:35.160 --> 27:38.840
I sure feel a lot safer,
anyone attacks me,

27:38.840 --> 27:42.080
I'll shatter his ear drum
and stun him with bulk mail.

27:42.080 --> 27:46.080
This guy is useless.

27:47.600 --> 27:50.800
I was hoping he would delve more
deeply into aura control.

27:50.800 --> 27:52.640
What are you talking about?

27:52.640 --> 27:54.720
My aura is my protection.

27:54.720 --> 27:58.720
That's why I didn't take a horn,
criminals seek out victims,

27:59.040 --> 28:02.680
and I don't give off victim
vibrations anymore.

28:02.680 --> 28:04.000
Lots of luck.

28:04.000 --> 28:05.600
Here's my aura.

28:05.600 --> 28:07.480
Mace?

28:07.480 --> 28:10.760
I've got a license, believe me,
it'll drop anyone to his knees.

28:10.760 --> 28:13.560
Shirley, what if he takes it
and uses it on you?

28:13.560 --> 28:16.080
I won't let him.

28:16.080 --> 28:18.040
All I ever heard from her
before the wedding

28:18.040 --> 28:19.800
was that I'm so natural and honest,

28:19.800 --> 28:22.800
now she turns round, tells the
whole hospital that I'm a jackass.

28:22.800 --> 28:26.200
Well, not the whole hospital.

28:26.200 --> 28:28.360
Dr Ridley, you've got to help us,
we're drowning,

28:28.360 --> 28:30.160
we can't talk to each other anymore.

28:30.160 --> 28:33.960
I don't know how to be a good
husband, neither does she.

28:33.960 --> 28:37.040
Victor, first of all,
I'm not a marriage counsellor.

28:37.040 --> 28:39.000
But you've helped us before,
you know us.

28:39.000 --> 28:41.640
And second,
she is a patient of Dr Weiss,

28:41.640 --> 28:44.520
if I were to see her that would be
a breach of professional ethics.

28:44.520 --> 28:46.520
OK, we'll invite Weiss too then,

28:46.520 --> 28:47.960
there's plenty of room
for the four of us in here.

28:47.960 --> 28:49.160
there's plenty of room
for the four of us in here.

28:49.160 --> 28:51.200
Believe me,
I want this marriage to work.

28:51.200 --> 28:53.400
I know it looks like
it's headed for the dumper,

28:53.400 --> 28:55.680
but there's something incredibly
valuable there.

28:55.680 --> 28:58.440
Jeez, we had it all,
for a day or two.

28:58.440 --> 28:59.760
Can't you help us get it back?

28:59.760 --> 29:02.800
Yes, I mean, I'll try, I'll call
Dr Weiss in the morning, OK?

29:02.800 --> 29:06.120
Great, great.

29:06.120 --> 29:08.040
What do you think,
we got married too soon?

29:08.040 --> 29:09.160
Mmm-hmm.

29:09.160 --> 29:09.560
What?

29:09.560 --> 29:12.000
What?

29:12.000 --> 29:14.040
Daniel.

29:14.040 --> 29:15.800
I'm sorry, were you sleeping?

29:15.800 --> 29:17.960
I just want to tell you,
there's going to be a couple

29:17.960 --> 29:21.800
of plain clothes detectives
roaming the halls tomorrow.

29:21.800 --> 29:24.720
She's still very beautiful.

29:24.720 --> 29:27.600
Who?

29:27.600 --> 29:31.600
An old flame, Donald,
now a patient of ours.

29:31.880 --> 29:33.960
I hadn't seen her in 45 years.

29:33.960 --> 29:36.680
Someone you were serious about?

29:36.680 --> 29:40.080
I was in a state of depression
for a year after we broke up.

29:40.080 --> 29:41.920
My first year at medical school.

29:41.920 --> 29:44.560
Well, you had a lot to be
depressed about then.

29:44.560 --> 29:48.560
I may never have told you, but
I came very close to flunking out.

29:48.640 --> 29:51.320
Probably an attempt to get even
with my parents

29:51.320 --> 29:52.720
for opposing the marriage.

29:52.720 --> 29:54.640
What were their objections?

29:54.640 --> 29:58.640
They were afraid she'd turn
up at Passover with a glazed ham.

29:59.800 --> 30:02.240
And they thought her too bohemian.

30:02.240 --> 30:04.160
Well, what were your choices,
Daniel?

30:04.160 --> 30:05.960
At that time
you had everything to lose.

30:05.960 --> 30:08.680
And a lot to gain.

30:08.680 --> 30:12.680
I mean, if Windsor had given up
the throne for Wally.

30:13.640 --> 30:15.840
As a matter of fact,
I did try to see her one more time,

30:15.840 --> 30:18.560
it was in spring.

30:18.560 --> 30:20.880
I drove out to Northampton where
she was going to school.

30:20.880 --> 30:23.360
I drove out to Northampton where
she was going to school.

30:23.360 --> 30:26.480
It was a total disaster.

30:26.480 --> 30:29.680
She'd just met somebody else and
I must have seemed rather pathetic.

30:29.680 --> 30:33.360
When was the last time you
drove 200 miles to see anyone?

30:33.360 --> 30:36.480
We get lazy, don't we?

30:36.480 --> 30:37.520
Busy.

30:37.520 --> 30:39.600
And before we know it,
we're running out of time.

30:39.600 --> 30:41.680
You going to be all right?

30:41.680 --> 30:42.800
Yeah.

30:42.800 --> 30:46.320
Good, because I'm not going to
worry about you, my friend.

30:46.320 --> 30:50.320
From where I'm sitting,
you've had a pretty good life.

30:55.360 --> 30:56.800
Annie?

30:56.800 --> 31:00.480
Um, I've been asking around
and some of the guys have volunteered

31:00.480 --> 31:02.400
to organise an escort service.

31:02.400 --> 31:05.040
This is a list of their names
and their page numbers,

31:05.040 --> 31:07.560
I thought you
might want to post that somewhere.

31:07.560 --> 31:11.560
Fiscus, it's very sweet of you,
uh...

31:12.240 --> 31:13.560
What, something wrong?

31:13.560 --> 31:17.560
How do we know you haven't
signed up the rapist?

31:23.120 --> 31:25.200
This place is getting bizarre.

31:25.200 --> 31:26.320
What do you mean?

31:26.320 --> 31:27.480
Because of the rapes.

31:27.480 --> 31:31.480
I guess there's no way we'll know
what the women are going through.

31:44.640 --> 31:46.880
Hey, Doc.

31:46.880 --> 31:50.880
Mr Keuhnelian, you're, uh,

31:52.280 --> 31:55.080
you're feeling better.

31:55.080 --> 31:57.840
I can see.

31:57.840 --> 32:00.040
Is this going to happen again?

32:00.040 --> 32:01.680
I don't know.

32:01.680 --> 32:05.200
Has it happened before?

32:05.200 --> 32:09.200
What about two days ago on the job?

32:10.320 --> 32:14.320
An attack like that would certainly
account for the fall.

32:19.040 --> 32:20.880
You're going to have to
level with me.

32:20.880 --> 32:24.520
Doc, construction work in the middle
of the winter, it's a slug job.

32:24.520 --> 32:26.280
People develop weird symptoms.

32:26.280 --> 32:28.000
Yeah, like blacking out?

32:28.000 --> 32:32.000
You start bitching and asking for
time off, you don't get hired back.

32:32.520 --> 32:34.240
This is important, Mr Keuhnelian.

32:34.240 --> 32:36.200
I know what's important.

32:36.200 --> 32:40.200
How often do you get these attacks?

32:43.800 --> 32:46.760
I made a promise to my father.

32:46.760 --> 32:50.760
That Mama and Lynnie
would be taken care of.

32:53.160 --> 32:55.640
The point that I'm trying to make,
oh, brother,

32:55.640 --> 32:59.440
can you stop doing this for a second?

32:59.440 --> 33:00.960
I'm sorry, Victor,

33:00.960 --> 33:03.680
the bride is supposed to write the
thank you notes for the gifts

33:03.680 --> 33:06.280
as soon as she returns from
honeymoon, I'm already a day late.

33:06.280 --> 33:09.120
Do you remember before the wedding
how everybody was coming up to us

33:09.120 --> 33:11.000
saying that marriage was
a lot of hard work,

33:11.000 --> 33:12.800
well, this is it,
this is the work part.

33:12.800 --> 33:16.800
I am working,
what do you think all this is?

33:16.920 --> 33:18.840
Can we just start over?

33:18.840 --> 33:20.280
OK, I've been thinking about it,

33:20.280 --> 33:22.400
and what I've decided is it
might be a good...

33:22.400 --> 33:24.680
You decided?

33:24.680 --> 33:28.640
We don't have to do it if you don't
like the idea, we can talk it over.

33:28.640 --> 33:30.760
What's the point, Victor,
you've already made the decision.

33:30.760 --> 33:32.680
What's the point, Victor,
you've already made the decision.

33:32.680 --> 33:35.080
And if I don't agree with you,
you're going to be mad.

33:35.080 --> 33:36.000
I won't get mad.

33:36.000 --> 33:37.520
I won't get mad.

33:37.520 --> 33:41.520
OK, what I think, what I think,
what I suppose,

33:41.640 --> 33:44.480
what I guess, what I suggest
is it might be a good idea

33:44.480 --> 33:46.600
if we sought
some professional guidance.

33:46.600 --> 33:48.040
Are you with me so far?

33:48.040 --> 33:49.560
I'm not sure.

33:49.560 --> 33:52.800
The two of us could maybe
sit down with Dr Ridley, Dr Weiss

33:52.800 --> 33:56.800
and, sort of, talk things over.

33:57.680 --> 33:58.960
It might do us some good.

33:58.960 --> 34:01.280
Then you're willing to give it a try?

34:01.280 --> 34:02.320
OK.

34:02.320 --> 34:04.240
Oh, fantastic, thank you, sweetheart,

34:04.240 --> 34:06.320
OK, we have an appointment
tonight at 7.30.

34:06.320 --> 34:10.320
Wait a minute, you scheduled
an appointment without asking me?

34:11.280 --> 34:14.520
No, I already looked for it.

34:14.520 --> 34:18.000
Look, maybe you didn't have it with
you when you were in here.

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
I'm going to be late
if we don't leave now.

34:20.000 --> 34:21.639
Listen,
this guy doesn't take a hint.

34:21.639 --> 34:24.600
Look, I've got to get Mr Benton's
percadim from the medication room,

34:24.600 --> 34:25.800
would you mind?

34:25.800 --> 34:27.760
Ah, sure, watch these for me.

34:27.760 --> 34:29.560
OK.

34:29.560 --> 34:33.560
Look, sir...

35:01.840 --> 35:03.320
Argh! My eyes!

35:03.320 --> 35:06.600
Aaaaargh!

35:06.600 --> 35:08.040
Oh God!

35:08.040 --> 35:09.280
Help, help!

35:09.280 --> 35:10.760
My eyes!

35:10.760 --> 35:14.760
Oh, it burns, oh, my God, my eyes!

35:20.480 --> 35:24.480
I'll be right back.

35:30.640 --> 35:32.680
Respiratory gave him
a clean bill of health,

35:32.680 --> 35:36.680
his face is pretty inflamed
but he'll be OK.

35:37.400 --> 35:38.880
How are you doing?

35:38.880 --> 35:41.920
I want to know why they're not
charging him with attempted rape.

35:41.920 --> 35:44.440
The police say they don't have
enough evidence yet.

35:44.440 --> 35:45.920
They'll charge him
with criminal trespass.

35:45.920 --> 35:49.720
They'll charge him
with criminal trespass.

35:49.720 --> 35:51.640
Shirley,
he claims he was in there working.

35:51.640 --> 35:55.640
It's a security area, come on.

35:56.000 --> 35:57.800
I'll tell you something, Wendy,

35:57.800 --> 36:01.800
when I saw him coming at me from the
corner, I was ready to kill him.

36:04.600 --> 36:06.520
Are they at least going to be
able to hold him?

36:06.520 --> 36:08.320
For a little while.

36:08.320 --> 36:11.640
If he wasn't going to rape someone,
what did they think he was doing?

36:11.640 --> 36:15.640
Stealing drugs.

36:24.000 --> 36:25.800
Come on, come on,
let's not stop now,

36:25.800 --> 36:27.840
I mean,
you two called this meeting, right?

36:27.840 --> 36:29.080
He did, without asking me.

36:29.080 --> 36:31.760
Oh, would you, please, stop it?
We've discussed that already.

36:31.760 --> 36:33.480
Besides,
we've got bigger fish to fry.

36:33.480 --> 36:35.520
Let's get back to Roberta's dream.

36:35.520 --> 36:37.240
Aha!

36:37.240 --> 36:40.800
Now, in her dream,
the crashing aeroplane.

36:40.800 --> 36:42.160
Now, in her dream,
the crashing aeroplane.

36:42.160 --> 36:43.920
Swooping.

36:43.920 --> 36:46.840
The swooping aeroplane
represents a marriage

36:46.840 --> 36:48.880
that she feels is out of control.

36:48.880 --> 36:51.240
Hey, this marriage never
got off the ground.

36:51.240 --> 36:53.360
I don't really think swooping or
crashing or diving...

36:53.360 --> 36:55.040
I don't really think swooping or
crashing or diving...

36:55.040 --> 36:58.600
Of course I did, but I can't always
be a puppy frolicking in the woods.

36:58.600 --> 36:59.720
I don't expect you to be.

36:59.720 --> 37:01.600
Hey, I've got a lot
of responsibilities.

37:01.600 --> 37:03.800
What's this about a puppy?

37:03.800 --> 37:06.680
Well, at their wedding it was
part of Roberta's vows.

37:06.680 --> 37:09.760
And if you'd been there,
you would have known that.

37:09.760 --> 37:13.760
My fear is that she will surrender
to this lack of control,

37:13.960 --> 37:16.000
and backslide into her old habit

37:16.000 --> 37:18.640
of allowing other people
to dominate her.

37:18.640 --> 37:22.280
OK, so you're saying this
sudden change in lifestyle

37:22.280 --> 37:24.960
has triggered a regression
on Roberta's part?

37:24.960 --> 37:28.520
Dr Ridley, please,
I think we're getting somewhere.

37:28.520 --> 37:31.960
ALL TALK OVER EACH OTHER

37:31.960 --> 37:35.960
Would you stay out of this?

37:44.760 --> 37:48.760
Don't take it so hard, sweetie, it
happens to all you guys now and then.

37:55.200 --> 37:59.200
We were all set to go out, me
and Myra, she bought a new dress.

38:02.680 --> 38:04.920
She was smiling, we were happy,

38:04.920 --> 38:08.920
it's the first time we've been happy
since...

38:12.520 --> 38:15.440
Then the kids woke up, both of them,
they woke up,

38:15.440 --> 38:19.120
"I can't find my candy bar, Timothy
hit me, uh, I got a stomach ache."

38:19.120 --> 38:20.520
All that usual sort of crap

38:20.520 --> 38:22.680
that keeps us from
going and doing anything.

38:22.680 --> 38:23.960
I can't stand that stuff,

38:23.960 --> 38:26.040
of course, me and Myra
get in one of our fights,

38:26.040 --> 38:28.680
same fight we had a million
times before only worse this time.

38:28.680 --> 38:31.680
See, she's too belligerent with them
and I'm just a push over,

38:31.680 --> 38:34.520
they're going to turn out to be
juvenile delinquents

38:34.520 --> 38:37.360
or something like that.

38:37.360 --> 38:41.360
Nice anniversary, huh?

38:45.960 --> 38:47.280
So, what's the big deal?

38:47.280 --> 38:48.320
Not the earth shaking,

38:48.320 --> 38:51.440
I just figured you could use this
now, rather than wait until Friday.

38:51.440 --> 38:54.200
Newbury Street Cleaners,
you're kidding? So, this is it.

38:54.200 --> 38:55.280
Happy honeymoon.

38:55.280 --> 38:57.440
Don't I wish.

38:57.440 --> 38:59.040
Open it.

38:59.040 --> 39:03.040
OK.

39:04.040 --> 39:05.200
What is it?

39:05.200 --> 39:07.480
Genuine, Moroccan wedding blanket,

39:07.480 --> 39:09.960
Bedouin swear it confers
a blessing on the marriage

39:09.960 --> 39:11.480
and redoubles sexual potency.

39:11.480 --> 39:12.800
You've got to be kidding.

39:12.800 --> 39:15.320
And they also use it at night
when they tether their camels.

39:15.320 --> 39:17.560
Oh, great, one hump or two, oh,
Fiscus, you're so full of it.

39:17.560 --> 39:19.640
Oh, great, one hump or two, oh,
Fiscus, you're so full of it.

39:19.640 --> 39:21.480
I was using it
as a bath mat, you know.

39:21.480 --> 39:24.320
Here you are, Wayne.

39:24.320 --> 39:26.640
I don't believe what I'm seeing.

39:26.640 --> 39:29.400
Isn't this a dromedary
cloth from Marrakech?

39:29.400 --> 39:31.560
This was my wedding present
to Victor and Roberta.

39:31.560 --> 39:33.920
You don't know how lucky you are,
this is very valuable.

39:33.920 --> 39:34.600
It is?

39:34.600 --> 39:36.000
It is?

39:36.000 --> 39:39.080
Well, I just thought, what with
Roberta's broadcast and all.

39:39.080 --> 39:41.280
Ah, yes, these last few days have
not been easy for you.

39:41.280 --> 39:44.240
Ah, yes, these last few days have
not been easy for you.

39:44.240 --> 39:47.280
Let me say this, I know you could
have done without the publicity,

39:47.280 --> 39:50.480
but I honestly admire
the impulse behind it.

39:50.480 --> 39:53.160
You admire a woman who shoots her
mouth off over the airwaves?

39:53.160 --> 39:54.960
No, I meant your decision to
get married,

39:54.960 --> 39:56.520
and do you know why I liked it?

39:56.520 --> 40:00.200
Because it was spontaneous, spur
of the moment, wildly impulsive.

40:00.200 --> 40:01.520
That's for sure.

40:01.520 --> 40:02.880
Hey, whose blanket?

40:02.880 --> 40:03.960
Victor's.

40:03.960 --> 40:06.040
Natural dyes in here,
this thing's worth a mint.

40:06.040 --> 40:07.240
OK, Luther, don't rub it in.

40:07.240 --> 40:09.400
You're getting to be
a household name around here.

40:09.400 --> 40:11.440
Now, now,
he's feeling badly enough as it is.

40:11.440 --> 40:12.920
I don't want to talk about it, OK,

40:12.920 --> 40:15.080
everything I say gets stood on
its head. I'm fed up.

40:15.080 --> 40:16.200
I know just what you mean.

40:16.200 --> 40:18.240
Why don't you and Roberta get
some therapy together?

40:18.240 --> 40:19.440
Why don't you and Roberta get
some therapy together?

40:19.440 --> 40:21.760
I had a great girlfriend in
high school named Jenny,

40:21.760 --> 40:22.960
gave me the same problems,

40:22.960 --> 40:25.320
everything I said,
she twisted it 50 different ways.

40:25.320 --> 40:26.040
So, what did you do?

40:26.040 --> 40:27.880
So, what did you do?

40:27.880 --> 40:29.400
I could have guessed.

40:29.400 --> 40:31.320
And now he's on the board
of the MTA.

40:31.320 --> 40:33.480
You see that, Victor,
if Roberta cuts you loose,

40:33.480 --> 40:35.480
she has a brilliant
career in transportation.

40:35.480 --> 40:39.480
My sympathies.

40:40.320 --> 40:42.840
Luther,
is that blanket really worth money?

40:42.840 --> 40:44.080
I saw it in a magazine,

40:44.080 --> 40:46.480
and I think some big star like
Joan Crawford

40:46.480 --> 40:50.480
had a whole collection of them,
it's worth a fortune.

40:57.360 --> 40:59.480
Uh, Dr Auschlander?

40:59.480 --> 41:01.240
I got the test results on Mrs Ryan.

41:01.240 --> 41:02.640
Tell me.

41:02.640 --> 41:05.600
Well, apparently, she cross combined
halcyon, inderol,

41:05.600 --> 41:08.680
clinoril and diovan,
the drugs interacted causing toxicity

41:08.680 --> 41:10.560
and aggravated her congestive
heart condition.

41:10.560 --> 41:11.800
and aggravated her congestive
heart condition.

41:11.800 --> 41:13.720
Looks like a case of too
many doctors,

41:13.720 --> 41:15.920
none of whom knew what
the others were giving her.

41:15.920 --> 41:18.200
Thank you,
I'd like to tell her myself.

41:18.200 --> 41:21.600
OK, seems strange that this could
happen to a woman so bright.

41:21.600 --> 41:25.520
I was about to release him
but then he had some kind of, um,

41:25.520 --> 41:28.040
I don't know,
episode in his room last night.

41:28.040 --> 41:30.960
My guess is from a head trauma
he suffered in the fall.

41:30.960 --> 41:32.280
Convulsive?

41:32.280 --> 41:35.200
No, it's more like some
kind of vascular problem,

41:35.200 --> 41:39.200
his sensory nerves are effected,
blindness, slurred speech.

41:41.960 --> 41:45.760
I don't know, I can't help feeling
he's not telling me something.

41:45.760 --> 41:47.240
Maybe so, what do you want me to do?

41:47.240 --> 41:50.320
Well, I thought maybe you could
stop in and talk to him.

41:50.320 --> 41:53.640
He's your patient, Jack, I'm not
going to do your leg work for you.

41:53.640 --> 41:56.000
If you feel he's giving you
an incomplete history,

41:56.000 --> 41:58.800
I suggest you find some way
to fill in the gaps. OK?

41:58.800 --> 42:01.080
Yes, sir.

42:01.080 --> 42:04.200
Will you, for a moment, just listen
to what I'm trying to say to you?

42:04.200 --> 42:06.600
Not if you're going to talk to me
like I was nine years old.

42:06.600 --> 42:08.960
A nine-year-old child would
have had more sense,

42:08.960 --> 42:11.440
you should know you cannot mix
medications at random.

42:11.440 --> 42:13.160
I knew what I was doing.

42:13.160 --> 42:15.400
I was giving you
the benefit of the doubt.

42:15.400 --> 42:17.280
I wanted to get high.

42:17.280 --> 42:18.160
Why?

42:18.160 --> 42:19.720
Why?

42:19.720 --> 42:22.640
What do you want me to say,
that I'm sorry?

42:22.640 --> 42:25.320
You act like I did it just
to spite you.

42:25.320 --> 42:27.240
What difference does
it make to you, anyway?

42:27.240 --> 42:31.240
Because it does.

42:31.920 --> 42:35.920
You always had a place in my heart.

42:36.800 --> 42:38.400
That's what you said 45 years ago.

42:38.400 --> 42:42.320
But you should have done something
about it, didn't you realise,

42:42.320 --> 42:44.640
I'd have gone off with
you in a flash.

42:44.640 --> 42:48.120
I told everybody to go to hell,
my father, the priest, your rabbi.

42:48.120 --> 42:50.960
Why didn't you,
why didn't you take a risk?

42:50.960 --> 42:54.320
I didn't have the courage.

42:54.320 --> 42:57.080
There's no point in dwelling on what
might have been.

42:57.080 --> 42:58.600
You'll be going home in a day or two,

42:58.600 --> 43:01.080
and if you exercise
a little common sense,

43:01.080 --> 43:04.920
which, incidentally, you have
never had in abundant supply,

43:04.920 --> 43:08.920
I'm sure you'll be dancing
at my funeral.

43:09.800 --> 43:13.480
I knew it.

43:13.480 --> 43:15.440
Something is very wrong with you.

43:15.440 --> 43:19.440
Liver cancer.

43:19.440 --> 43:21.080
I'm sorry.

43:21.080 --> 43:22.120
And glad.

43:22.120 --> 43:23.080
Glad?

43:23.080 --> 43:27.080
Glad?

43:27.400 --> 43:31.400
Imagine, if we'd told our
parents to leave us be,

43:31.840 --> 43:34.280
what kind of a life
do you think we'd have had?

43:34.280 --> 43:36.520
I don't know.

43:36.520 --> 43:40.240
But we sure would have had
a lot of fun.

43:40.240 --> 43:44.240
Or driven each other absolutely mad.

43:45.760 --> 43:47.440
I'll be right with you, sir.

43:47.440 --> 43:49.840
Here's the X-ray on the Cedar case.

43:49.840 --> 43:50.960
Thanks a lot.

43:50.960 --> 43:52.320
Not too good.

43:52.320 --> 43:54.240
It's hard to tell which end is up.

43:54.240 --> 43:56.280
You better tell it to him straight.

43:56.280 --> 43:57.560
Do I have to?

43:57.560 --> 43:58.600
You're the doctor.

43:58.600 --> 44:02.600
This is the worst
part about being in medicine.

44:03.080 --> 44:04.120
How is he?

44:04.120 --> 44:08.120
Well, it's definitely a bad sprain,
but luckily, it's not broken.

44:08.360 --> 44:11.160
I've told him before to look both
ways before crossing.

44:11.160 --> 44:12.640
Best friend, huh?

44:12.640 --> 44:16.640
Well, I taped him up, and he
should be fine in a couple of weeks.

44:17.560 --> 44:19.520
Try to keep his paw clean.

44:19.520 --> 44:21.880
I really appreciate this, Mr Doctor.

44:21.880 --> 44:24.280
I'll never, ever forget what you did.

44:24.280 --> 44:27.400
Well,
it was all in the line of duty.

44:27.400 --> 44:29.480
Tell me, what do you want to be
when you grow up?

44:29.480 --> 44:33.080
Are you kidding?
A fire man.

44:33.080 --> 44:35.240
Hi. You going off duty soon?

44:35.240 --> 44:36.280
Couple of minutes.

44:36.280 --> 44:37.440
Good, I'll wait
and walk you to your car.

44:37.440 --> 44:40.040
Good, I'll wait
and walk you to your car.

44:40.040 --> 44:41.080
I'll be fine.

44:41.080 --> 44:43.640
You're not worried?
Fear does have its place, you know.

44:43.640 --> 44:44.680
Sure, I'm worried,

44:44.680 --> 44:47.000
everybody's letting this
thing get them so spooked,

44:47.000 --> 44:48.680
they're jumping
at their own shadows.

44:48.680 --> 44:50.560
Look, Donald, I'll be careful,

44:50.560 --> 44:52.520
but I have work to do
and a family.

44:52.520 --> 44:55.880
Very sensible attitude.

44:55.880 --> 44:58.680
All right, let me try this,
there's a maniac on the loose,

44:58.680 --> 45:00.800
and personally, I'm terrified
for my own safety,

45:00.800 --> 45:03.400
would you be so kind
as to walk me to my car?

45:03.400 --> 45:06.160
All right, Donald,
I think I can do that.

45:06.160 --> 45:10.160
Thanks very much.

45:43.120 --> 45:46.520
Who is it?

45:46.520 --> 45:49.640
Who are you?

45:49.640 --> 45:53.400
Hey, come on.

45:53.400 --> 45:56.160
CRASHING

45:56.160 --> 46:00.160
Argh!

46:04.000 --> 46:31.000
