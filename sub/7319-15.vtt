PREVIOUSLY
ON "GREY'S ANATOMY"...
MARRY ME, CRISTINA YANG.

00:15.733 --> 00:19.633
ARE YOU SAYING YES?
Y-YEAH.

00:19.667 --> 00:22.800
WE'RE MARRIED!
ADELE AND I ARE GETTING
A DIVORCE.

00:22.833 --> 00:25.667
HAS IT EVEN OCCURRED TO YOU
THAT MAYBE I'M NOT INTERESTED?

00:25.700 --> 00:26.900
I RAISED YOU TO BE
AN EXTRAORDINARY HUMAN BEING.

00:26.933 --> 00:29.500
SO IMAGINE MY DISAPPOINTMENT
WHEN I WAKE UP AFTER FIVE YEARS

00:29.533 --> 00:31.767
AND DISCOVER THAT YOU'RE
NO MORE THAN ORDINARY.

00:31.800 --> 00:34.633
YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY
I'M SO ORDINARY?

00:34.667 --> 00:38.233
YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED
TO ME? YOU. YOU HAPPENED TO ME.

00:39.767 --> 00:41.633

00:41.667 --> 00:44.333
(Meredith) DISAPPEARANCES
HAPPEN IN SCIENCE--

00:44.367 --> 00:46.767
DISEASE CAN SUDDENLY
FADE AWAY,

00:46.800 --> 00:50.267
TUMORS GO MISSING.

00:50.300 --> 00:54.100
WE OPEN SOMEONE UP TO DISCOVER
THE CANCER IS GONE.

00:54.133 --> 00:56.267
IT'S UNEXPLAINED,

00:56.300 --> 00:59.167
IT'S RARE, BUT IT HAPPENS.

00:59.200 --> 01:01.233
WE CALL IT MISDIAGNOSIS...

01:01.267 --> 01:04.133
SAY WE NEVER SAW IT
IN THE FIRST PLACE...

01:04.167 --> 01:07.300
ANY EXPLANATION
BUT THE TRUTH...

01:07.333 --> 01:09.333
***

01:09.367 --> 01:14.067
THAT LIFE IS
FULL OF VANISHING ACTS.

01:14.067 --> 01:17.100
IF SOMETHING THAT WE
DIDN'T KNOW WE HAD DISAPPEARS,

01:17.133 --> 01:20.267
DO WE MISS IT?

01:20.300 --> 01:23.600
***

01:23.633 --> 01:26.100
MEREDITH.

01:26.133 --> 01:29.100
***

01:29.133 --> 01:31.067
MEREDITH!

01:31.067 --> 01:33.200
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

01:33.233 --> 01:36.400
***

01:39.533 --> 01:41.433
(Meredith)
I WAS TAKING A BATH.

01:41.467 --> 01:44.567
THAT'S NOT A BATH.
I KNOW WHAT A BATH LOOKS LIKE.
DROP IT.

01:44.600 --> 01:46.100
LOOK, YOUR MOTHER--
DROP IT.

01:46.133 --> 01:48.067
YOUR MOTHER--
LOOK, YOUR MOTHER WAS LUCID,

01:48.067 --> 01:49.733
AND SHE SAID THINGS,
AND NOW SHE'S--

01:49.767 --> 01:51.700
GONE, AND EVERYTHING'S
BACK TO NORMAL.

01:51.733 --> 01:55.267
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.
YEAH, EXCEPT SHE'S HAVING
HEART SURGERY TODAY.

01:55.300 --> 01:58.100
(sighs)
HEY, DO YOU WANT ME
TO TALK TO THE CHIEF?

01:58.133 --> 02:00.233
I KNOW YOU HAVE
THE TRIAGE THING TODAY,

02:00.267 --> 02:02.300
BUT HE'LL GIVE YOU THE DAY OFF.
STOP. I DO NOT NEED RESCUING.

02:02.333 --> 02:04.233
OH, YOU WOULD HAVE DROWNED
IN THE BATHTUB

02:04.267 --> 02:05.433
HAD I NOT BEEN THERE.

02:05.467 --> 02:08.200
I'M A SURGEON.
I DO THE RESCUING.

02:08.233 --> 02:11.067
YOU ARE NOT MY KNIGHT
IN SHINING... WHATEVER.

02:11.100 --> 02:13.733
SO WE'RE GONNA FIGHT BECAUSE
I PULLED YOU OUT OF THE TUB?

02:13.767 --> 02:15.600
YOU HAVE A PLACE.
YOU COULD SLEEP AT IT.

02:15.633 --> 02:17.300
AND THEN YOU DON'T HAVE TO
PULL ME OUT OF THE BATHTUB.

02:17.333 --> 02:20.533
YOU'RE EVERYWHERE,
ALL THE TIME, SAYING THINGS.
THIS IS
THE HAPPY EVER AFTER PART.

02:20.567 --> 02:22.600
AND IN THE HAPPILY
EVER AFTER PART,

02:22.633 --> 02:25.100
THE GUY IS THERE,
ALL THE TIME, SAYING THINGS,

02:25.133 --> 02:27.767
AND THE GIRLS LOVE IT.
GO TO WORK.
I'LL SEE YOU THERE.

02:27.800 --> 02:31.333
JUST FOR THE RECORD, I AM
YOUR KNIGHT IN SHINING WHATEVER.

02:31.367 --> 02:35.100
***

02:35.133 --> 02:37.633
I DID NOT TRY TO DROWN MYSELF
IN THE BATHTUB.

02:37.667 --> 02:39.800
HEY, I ATE EVERYTHING
OUT OF THE FRIDGE LAST NIGHT,

02:39.833 --> 02:43.200
EVERYTHING, INCLUDING
A TUB OF BUTTER.

02:43.233 --> 02:46.267
THERE'S NO JUDGMENT HERE.

02:46.300 --> 02:49.200
YOU EVER FEEL LIKE
YOU WERE DISAPPEARING?

02:49.233 --> 02:50.500
ALL THE TIME.

02:50.533 --> 02:53.367
WHY CAN'T I JUST BE THAT
HAPPILY EVER AFTER PERSON?

02:53.400 --> 02:55.300
WHY CAN'T I BELIEVE IN THAT?

02:55.333 --> 02:58.200
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
I BELIEVE IN ANYMORE.

02:58.233 --> 03:01.133
***

03:05.767 --> 03:07.600
WE'RE NOT TELLING PEOPLE.

03:07.633 --> 03:09.300
I HAVEN'T TOLD ANYONE.

03:09.333 --> 03:11.233
I KNOW, I KNOW.
JUST DON'T.

03:11.267 --> 03:13.167
(chuckles)
I'M NOT GOING TO, YET.

03:13.200 --> 03:16.067
NO, I JUST--I-I NEED TO TELL
MY FRIENDS HERE FIRST.

03:16.100 --> 03:17.533
BUT I HAVE FRIENDS HERE.

03:17.567 --> 03:20.500
(elevator bell rings)

03:20.533 --> 03:21.800
SHEPHERD.

03:21.833 --> 03:23.733
OH, NO.
YOU CAN'T TELL SHEPHERD.

03:23.767 --> 03:25.733
YOU CANNOT TELL SHEPHERD
UNTIL I'VE TOLD MEREDITH.

03:25.767 --> 03:27.267
IT WOULD BE A THING.

03:27.300 --> 03:29.600
YOU ACT LIKE
THIS IS A DISASTER.

03:29.633 --> 03:32.133
THE WORLD WON'T IMPLODE
IF PEOPLE KNOW.

03:33.567 --> 03:36.067
I WILL TELL THEM,
TODAY.

03:36.067 --> 03:37.633
JUST...

03:37.667 --> 03:39.333
WAIT.

03:52.500 --> 03:53.667
(clears throat)

03:53.700 --> 03:55.300
(elevator bell dings)

03:55.333 --> 03:56.533
GOOD MORNING.

03:56.567 --> 03:58.733
MORNING. MORNING.

03:59.867 --> 04:01.367
WHAT'S DIFFERENT?

04:01.400 --> 04:03.300
NOTHING.

04:03.333 --> 04:05.267
LEAVE HIM BE.

04:05.300 --> 04:07.100
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR HAIR?

04:07.133 --> 04:08.333
NOTHING.

04:08.367 --> 04:09.633
MM-HMM.

04:09.667 --> 04:12.267
(ding)

04:20.767 --> 04:22.100
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR HAIR?

04:22.133 --> 04:23.733
(clears throat)
LEAVE HIM BE.

04:23.767 --> 04:25.267
HE DYED IT.

04:25.300 --> 04:26.767
(Richard sighs)
BUT WHY?

04:26.800 --> 04:29.400
OW!
(whispers) LEAVE HIM BE.

04:29.433 --> 04:31.333
(Derek whispers)
WHAT AM I DOING? WHAT?

04:31.367 --> 04:33.533
OKAY, BUT WHY?

04:33.567 --> 04:35.800
MEN WHO HAVE GRAY HAIR

04:35.833 --> 04:38.567
ARE NOTICED LESS
THAN MEN WHO DON'T.

04:38.600 --> 04:41.067
BY WHO?

04:44.500 --> 04:45.733
WELL...

04:45.767 --> 04:47.667
BY THE LADIES?
(laughing)

04:49.767 --> 04:51.533
(coughs)

04:51.567 --> 04:53.500
LOOKS GOOD, CHIEF.

04:53.533 --> 04:56.533
OH, VERY NATURAL.
LADIES WILL LOVE IT.

04:56.567 --> 04:59.167
(lowers voice)
HE IS ALONE...

04:59.200 --> 05:00.433
ALL ALONE.

05:00.467 --> 05:03.467
DO ANY OF YOU EVEN KNOW
WHAT THAT'S LIKE?

05:03.500 --> 05:05.800
LIVES WITH CRISTINA,
DATES THE PERFECT 12 YEAR OLD...

05:05.833 --> 05:08.133
MAN-WHORE...

05:08.167 --> 05:10.300
HIS WIFE LEFT HIM
AFTER 25 YEARS OF MARRIAGE.

05:10.333 --> 05:13.467
SO IF THE MAN WANTS TO DYE
HIS HAIR FOR THE LADIES,

05:13.500 --> 05:16.167
LET HIM DYE HIS HAIR
FOR THE LADIES.
(mouths words)

05:16.200 --> 05:18.067
(normal voice)
LEAVE HIM BE.

05:18.100 --> 05:19.533
(elevator bell dings)

05:19.567 --> 05:21.533
IT'S--IT'S WEIRD.

05:21.567 --> 05:23.467
IT'S WEIRD.
IT'S WEIRD, RIGHT?

05:23.500 --> 05:25.400
I NEED
MORE TRIAGE TEAR TAGS.

05:25.433 --> 05:27.567
LIVING WITH SOMEBODY
I'M MARRIED TO IS WEIRD.

05:27.600 --> 05:30.467
I MEAN, I'M HIS BOSS
AND HIS WIFE.

05:30.500 --> 05:33.733
AT WORK, I'M GIVING HIM ORDERS.
IN BED, HE'S GIVING ME--

05:33.767 --> 05:35.533
STOP RIGHT THERE.
I DON'T NEED TO KNOW THIS.

05:35.567 --> 05:37.067
I'M TIRED. I'M BUSY.

05:37.100 --> 05:39.367
WHILE I WILL CONCEDE
YOU AND O'MALLEY HAVE

05:39.400 --> 05:40.533
SOME CHALLENGES TO OVERCOME,

05:40.567 --> 05:43.467
I'M ASKING YOU TO REMEMBER
THAT THIS DAY IS A MARATHON

05:43.500 --> 05:46.133
AND MY MIND CAN ONLY HOLD
WHAT IT NEEDS TO KNOW.

05:46.167 --> 05:48.300
YOUR SEX LIFE CANNOT BE HELD
IN MY MIND TODAY. EVER.

05:48.333 --> 05:50.800
IT CANNOT BE HELD
IN MY MIND EVER, NEVER.
WHATEVER.

05:50.833 --> 05:53.267
SYDNEY HERON HERE
TO LEND A HAND. HEY.

05:53.300 --> 05:55.367
HI. HELLO.

05:55.400 --> 05:58.267
OH, MIRANDA, HEY.
NICE CLINIC. VERY NICE.

05:58.300 --> 06:00.833
HEY, SYDNEY.
I MEAN REAL, REAL NICE.

06:00.867 --> 06:02.067
CHEERFUL. (chuckles)

06:02.067 --> 06:04.433
NO BETTER WAY TO DISTINGUISH
YOURSELF FOR CHIEF RESIDENT

06:04.467 --> 06:06.767
THAN TO OPEN
A MULTIMILLION-DOLLAR CLINIC.

06:06.800 --> 06:08.467
SMART THINKING.
STRATEGIC.

06:08.500 --> 06:09.667
CHIEF RESIDENT?

06:09.700 --> 06:11.600
I MYSELF HAVE USED THE TIME

06:11.633 --> 06:13.533
TO MASTER SEVERAL COMPLEX
SURGICAL PROCEDURES.

06:13.567 --> 06:16.433
BUT THIS IS, UM,
ANOTHER WAY TO GO.

06:16.467 --> 06:18.400
WHAT IS SHE TALKING ABOUT?
THE CHIEF RESIDENT.

06:18.433 --> 06:20.333
THE CHIEF RESIDENT.
YEAH, FOR NEXT YEAR.

06:20.367 --> 06:23.233
THE ONE FIFTH-YEAR RESIDENT
THAT RULES ALL RESIDENTS.

06:23.267 --> 06:26.067
OH, SHE--
OKAY, SHE'S CUTE.

06:26.067 --> 06:28.733
SHE'S ACTING LIKE SHE DIDN'T
KNOW ABOUT IT. CUTE.
I'M NOT CUTE.

06:28.767 --> 06:31.167
I'M ON TO YOU.
OKAY, I'M A COMPETITOR.

06:31.200 --> 06:32.300
GRR.

06:32.333 --> 06:33.567
I BITE.

06:33.600 --> 06:37.567
OKAY. WELL, I'LL JUST
WAIT FOR YOU IN THE PIT.

06:55.733 --> 06:58.133
(clears throat)

07:03.733 --> 07:04.667
WHAT?

07:04.700 --> 07:06.733
NOTHING.

07:16.667 --> 07:18.200
WHAT?!

07:18.233 --> 07:20.367
OKAY, CRANKY.
FO-FORGET IT.

07:20.400 --> 07:22.767
(Alex) AM I THE ONLY ONE
WHO THINKS THIS TRIAGE TEST

07:22.800 --> 07:24.367
IS A WASTE OF TIME?

07:24.400 --> 07:27.167
THERE'S A PLATYSMAPLASTY
ON THE BOARD.

07:27.200 --> 07:29.333
I HAD SLOAN ALL PREPPED
TO LET ME SCRUB IN.
GEORGE, HEY.

07:29.367 --> 07:30.700
HEY.
HOW'S IT GOING?

07:30.733 --> 07:32.800
GOOD.
YOU LIKE LIVING IN A HOTEL?

07:32.833 --> 07:35.067
YEAH, IT'S GOOD.
'CAUSE YOUR ROOM'S
STILL THERE...

07:35.100 --> 07:38.200
NEXT TO MINE.
OH, IZZIE.

07:38.233 --> 07:40.367
I'M JUST SAYING, IF YOU
DON'T LIKE... THE HOTEL,

07:40.400 --> 07:42.667
YOU CAN ALWAYS
JUST MOVE RIGHT BACK IN.

07:42.700 --> 07:45.367
YOU THINK I'M THIS BOY
THAT YOU NEED TO SAVE.

07:45.400 --> 07:47.267
I GET THAT, BUT--
AND IT--IT WOULD BE SWEET

07:47.300 --> 07:49.667
IF--IF IT WEREN'T
SO CONDESCENDING.

07:49.700 --> 07:51.667
SERIOUSLY,
IS IT TOO MUCH TO ASK

07:51.700 --> 07:53.567
TO BE PERFORMING
ACTUAL SURGERIES?

07:53.600 --> 07:55.533
WE ARE ACTUAL SURGEONS.
(clears throat)

07:58.333 --> 07:58.833
WHAT?

07:58.867 --> 08:01.533
(sighs) NOTHING.

08:01.567 --> 08:03.633
A LOT OF ARM SWELLING,

08:03.667 --> 08:05.333
BUT GOOD DISTAL PULSES,

08:05.367 --> 08:08.200
SO... WE CAN RULE OUT
COMPARTMENT SYNDROME.

08:08.233 --> 08:11.233
I SUSPECT A RADIUS FRACTURE,
SO I'D SPLINT

08:11.267 --> 08:13.233
AND GET AN ORTHO FOLLOW-UP.

08:13.267 --> 08:14.300
ANYTHING ELSE?

08:14.333 --> 08:16.233
NO.

08:16.267 --> 08:18.433
OKAY. THEN I GUESS
THIS MEANS--

08:18.467 --> 08:19.533
TIME.

08:19.567 --> 08:21.067
AND I'M DEAD.

08:21.067 --> 08:22.333
DEAD?

08:22.367 --> 08:24.433
(grunts and groans)

08:24.467 --> 08:26.633
YOU SENT HER HOME. THE BONE
PUNCTURED THROUGH HER SKIN.

08:26.667 --> 08:29.600
YEAH, BUT SHE HAD MULTIPLE
WOUNDS AND ABRASIONS--
A PUNCTURE OVER A BREAK

08:29.633 --> 08:32.067
IS AN OPEN FRACTURE
UNTIL PROVEN OTHERWISE.

08:32.100 --> 08:35.367
YEAH, I GOT SEPTIC, AND I
DIED AT HOME THANKS TO YOU.
OH, WHATEVER.

08:35.400 --> 08:38.833
NOT "WHATEVER" TO DEAD "MINOR
PUNCTURE WOUND THAT'S NOT" GUY.
YOU HAVE TO BE QUICK

08:38.867 --> 08:41.067
AND THOROUGH
WHILE USING YOUR INSTINCTS.

08:41.067 --> 08:42.433
YOU CAN'T BE FOOLED
BY WHAT YOUR EYES SEE.

08:42.467 --> 08:44.400
IF YOU ASSESS WRONG,
YOUR PATIENT COULD DIE

08:44.433 --> 08:47.233
WHILE WAITING FOR TREATMENT.
KAREV, YOU'RE NEXT.

08:47.267 --> 08:49.367
JUST THINK,
I'VE ALREADY KILLED HER.

08:49.400 --> 08:51.633
YOU CAN'T DO MORE DAMAGE
THAN THAT.
PEOPLE, TRIAGE IS ONE OF

08:51.667 --> 08:53.567
THE MOST IMPORTANT TOOLS
A DOCTOR HAS.

08:53.600 --> 08:56.800
IN A REAL EMERGENT SCENARIO,
YOU'LL HAVE ONLY MINUTES.

08:56.833 --> 08:59.567
AND IT'S SOMETHING YOU'LL BE
TESTED ON IN YOUR SURGICAL EX--

08:59.600 --> 09:01.067
SORRY.

09:01.067 --> 09:02.767
GEORGE.
I WAS JUST RECORDING
THE DRILL.

09:02.800 --> 09:05.067
YOU KNOW WHAT? CAN YOU
COME HERE FOR A SEC?
YEAH.

09:05.100 --> 09:06.833
ALL RIGHT, WE'RE WORKING
GEORGE, OKAY?
YEAH.

09:06.867 --> 09:08.367
I'M YOUR BOSS RIGHT NOW.
YES.

09:08.400 --> 09:10.267
ALL RIGHT?
YES. A VERY SEXY ONE.

09:10.300 --> 09:12.267
NO, NO, NO. YOU CANNOT
UNDERMINE MY AUTHORITY...
YEAH.

09:12.300 --> 09:15.067
IN FRONT OF THE OTHER INTERNS,
IN FRONT OF MY PEERS.
NO.

09:15.100 --> 09:17.300
O'MALLEY, TAKE THAT BACK TO
THE CLINIC WHERE IT BELONGS.

09:17.333 --> 09:19.700
SORRY.
ATTENTION, PEOPLE.
LOOK, I'M SORRY.

09:19.733 --> 09:22.333
I HAVE TO INTERRUPT THE SESSION
FOR A MOMENT.
CHIEF, I LIKE YOUR NEW HAIR.

09:22.367 --> 09:24.733
IT REALLY BRINGS OUT
YOUR EYES.

09:24.767 --> 09:25.867
DO YOU NEED SOMETHING, SIR?

09:25.900 --> 09:28.433
WE JUST RECEIVED WORD OF
A MASS CASUALTY INCIDENT NEARBY.

09:28.467 --> 09:30.067
ALL AVAILABLE
LEVEL ONE TRAUMA CENTERS

09:30.067 --> 09:32.267
HAVE BEEN ASKED TO RESPOND.

09:32.300 --> 09:34.367
I NEED TO SEND A TEAM
INTO THE FIELD IMMEDIATELY.

09:34.400 --> 09:36.300
IS THIS A PART
OF THE EXERCISE?

09:36.333 --> 09:38.267
ARE WE SUPPOSED TO ACT
APPROPRIATELY, UH, TENSE?

09:38.300 --> 09:39.900
THIS IS NOT AN EXERCISE
OR A DRILL, YANG.

09:39.933 --> 09:42.467
THIS IS AN EMERGENT SITUATION,
AND I NEED ALL HANDS ON DECK.
(Izzie) SERIOUSLY?

09:42.500 --> 09:43.600
WHAT HAPPENED?

09:43.633 --> 09:45.267
I DON'T HAVE DETAILS,
JUST ORDERS.

09:45.300 --> 09:48.200
***

09:51.500 --> 09:54.833
MEREDITH,
I HAVE A THING, NEWS.

09:54.867 --> 09:56.767
YOU AREN'T PREGNANT AGAIN,
ARE YOU?

09:56.800 --> 09:59.400
'CAUSE I CAN'T HANDLE
THE EXTRA MONTHS OF BITCHINESS.

09:59.433 --> 10:01.333
WE'RE CATCHING A RIDE
WITH SEATTLE 34.

10:01.367 --> 10:03.500
SPACE IS TIGHT,
SO HOLD YOUR KITS ON YOUR LAP.

10:03.533 --> 10:05.433
(Alex) WHERE ARE WE GOING?
WE'LL KNOW
WHEN WE GET THERE.

10:05.467 --> 10:08.333
FIRE, FLOOD, VOLCANO? I'M NOT
REALLY DRESSED FOR A VOLCANO.

10:08.367 --> 10:09.833
(Miranda) STEVENS.

10:09.867 --> 10:11.233
SORRY. INAPPROPRIATE.
SORRY.

10:11.267 --> 10:12.733
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

10:12.767 --> 10:15.333
I'M HAULING SUPPLIES.
I ONLY HAVE ROOM FOR FIVE.

10:15.367 --> 10:16.400
YANG.

10:16.433 --> 10:17.833
YES?
STAY WITH THE CHIEF.

10:17.867 --> 10:19.767
TAKE CARE
OF THE INCOMING WOUNDED.

10:19.800 --> 10:21.700
THE REST OF YOU, COME ON.
STEVENS WAS INAPPROPRIATE.

10:21.733 --> 10:25.033
HEY, WHAT WAS YOUR,
UH, NEWS?

10:25.067 --> 10:27.067
(sighs) JUST FORGET IT.

10:27.100 --> 10:29.067
FORGET IT.

10:33.867 --> 10:37.367
(siren wailing)

10:44.567 --> 10:47.233
(wailing continues)

10:50.400 --> 10:55.100
OH, EVERYBODY, MOVE YOUR I.D.s
TO THE OUTSIDE OF YOUR JACKET.

10:55.133 --> 10:57.033
WHEN WE GET THERE,
REMEMBER, TRIAGE.

10:57.067 --> 10:58.533
KAREV.

10:58.567 --> 11:00.467
GREEN TAGS--NONEMERGENT.
YELLOW--DELAYED CARE.

11:00.500 --> 11:02.500
RED TAGS--
NEEDS IMMEDIATE TREATMENT.
GOOD.

11:02.533 --> 11:05.133
ASSESS CAREFULLY, TAG AND GET
ALL THE CRITICAL PATIENTS

11:05.167 --> 11:07.133
INTO THE AMBULANCES
AS FAST AS POSSIBLE.

11:07.167 --> 11:09.067
DON'T GET IN THE WAY
OF SEARCH AND RESCUE,

11:09.100 --> 11:11.467
AND STAY CALM.
ANY WORD YET
ON WHAT HAPPENED?

11:11.500 --> 11:13.433
ALL WE KNOW IS THERE ARE
MULTIPLE TRAUMAS.

11:13.467 --> 11:17.267
(engine slows)

11:17.300 --> 11:20.067
(brakes squeak)

11:20.067 --> 11:21.833

11:21.867 --> 11:23.800
(people speaking indistinctly)

11:23.833 --> 11:26.733
(sirens wailing)

11:35.733 --> 11:38.600
HOLY MOTHER OF...

11:38.633 --> 11:41.500
(sirens wailing)

11:41.533 --> 11:44.700
(people speaking indistinctly)

11:54.533 --> 11:56.200
(child crying)

11:56.233 --> 12:00.133
(sirens wailing)

12:19.300 --> 12:21.500
DR. BAILEY,
WHERE DO YOU NEED US?

12:21.533 --> 12:23.367
WHERE SHOULD WE START FIRST?

12:23.400 --> 12:25.433
DR. BAILEY--

12:25.467 --> 12:28.067
I DON'T HAVE TIME
TO HOLD YOUR HANDS.

12:28.067 --> 12:30.200
YOU KNOW THE PROTOCOL.
GO DO IT.
DO WHAT?

12:30.233 --> 12:32.600
GO HELP PEOPLE.

12:32.633 --> 12:35.600
***

12:41.167 --> 12:43.800
(people speaking indistinctly)

12:45.233 --> 12:48.133
(mouths words)

12:48.167 --> 12:50.167
***

12:50.200 --> 12:51.800
(George)
YOU NEED SOME HELP?

12:51.833 --> 12:53.733
THERE'S NOTHING MORE
I CAN DO HERE.

12:53.767 --> 12:55.667
HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?
IT WAS A FOG BANK.

12:55.700 --> 12:57.533
CONTAINER SHIP
CLIPPED THE FERRY.

12:57.567 --> 12:59.267
(siren wails)

12:59.300 --> 13:02.433
***

13:02.467 --> 13:05.067
(Meredith) GOOD.
TAKE A DEEP BREATH FOR ME.

13:05.100 --> 13:07.400
OKAY, YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY.
YOUR INJURIES ARE MINOR.

13:07.433 --> 13:12.067
AN E.M.T. IS GONNA COME AND TAKE
YOU TO THE HOSPITAL, OKAY?

13:12.100 --> 13:15.067
(cries)

13:16.100 --> 13:17.667
IS THIS YOUR MOMMY?

13:20.633 --> 13:22.600
WHO ARE YOU WITH?

13:26.200 --> 13:28.300
OKAY, I WANT YOU TO STAY
RIGHT HERE, OKAY?

13:28.333 --> 13:30.167
STAY RIGHT HERE.

13:32.200 --> 13:35.100
DID YOU...
WET YOUR PANTS?

13:35.133 --> 13:37.133
THAT'S OKAY.
IT HAPPENS SOMETIMES--

13:37.167 --> 13:39.500
(man) COMING THROUGH!

13:39.533 --> 13:42.133
OKAY, OKAY.

13:42.167 --> 13:44.067
ALL RIGHT.

13:51.100 --> 13:53.400
IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

13:53.433 --> 13:56.100
FERRY BOATS
DON'T GET IN ACCIDENTS.

13:56.133 --> 13:58.067
THEY'RE SAFE.
THEY'RE RELIABLE.

13:58.100 --> 13:59.833
THE MOMENT
YOU TAKE ONE FOR GRANTED,

13:59.867 --> 14:03.067
ALONG COMES A CONTAINER SHIP
AND BOOM.

14:03.100 --> 14:05.633
I HAVE A THING
FOR FERRY BOATS.

14:07.333 --> 14:10.400
RESCHEDULE, UH, SWANSON'S,
UH, VALVE REPLACEMENT.

14:10.433 --> 14:12.333
WE'RE GONNA NEED THE O.R.
FOR THE INCOMING

14:12.367 --> 14:13.833
FROM THE FERRY ACCIDENT.

14:13.867 --> 14:16.400
I MEAN, THIS WHOLE DAY
HAD JUST BEEN...

14:16.433 --> 14:18.200
(sighs)

14:18.233 --> 14:20.400
THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG
WITH MEREDITH.

14:20.433 --> 14:23.067
I ASKED HER WHAT'S WRONG.
SHE SAYS NOTHING.

14:23.067 --> 14:25.733
THEN SHE TRIES
TO DROWNED HERSELF IN THE TUB.

14:25.767 --> 14:27.667
N-NOT ACTUALLY DROWNED,
I DON'T THINK.

14:27.700 --> 14:30.567
BUT SOMETHING WAS GOING ON,
AND SHE WILL NOT TALK ABOUT IT.

14:30.600 --> 14:32.667
WE WERE FINE,
AND NOW IT'S LIKE...

14:32.700 --> 14:35.433
(sighs)
I'M LIVING WITH A GHOST.

14:35.467 --> 14:37.133
YOU'RE CONFIDING IN ME.

14:37.167 --> 14:39.067
YES.

14:41.100 --> 14:44.067
CRISTINA AND I
ARE ENGAGED.

14:45.767 --> 14:47.067
CONGRATULATIONS.

14:47.100 --> 14:49.533
I MEAN, SHE DOESN'T WANT
TO TELL ANYONE.

14:49.567 --> 14:52.533
AT LEAST NOT UNTIL
SHE TELLS MEREDITH FIRST.

14:52.567 --> 14:54.467
YEAH, THEY'RE DIFFERENT
THAN OTHER WOMEN.

14:54.500 --> 14:56.133
(scoffs)
YES, THESE WOMEN...

14:56.167 --> 14:58.333
YES, THEY ARE.

14:58.367 --> 15:00.267
YOU KNOW, MAYBE WE'LL
NEVER KNOW THEM.

15:00.300 --> 15:02.167
I MEAN, REALLY KNOW THEM.

15:02.200 --> 15:04.100
AND NOW THAT YOU AND CRISTINA
ARE ENGAGED,

15:04.133 --> 15:07.633
YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO.
YOU AND YANG
ARE GETTIN' HITCHED?

15:09.567 --> 15:14.733
THERE'S A MASS CASUALTY
INCIDENT ROLLING IN, OKAY?

15:14.767 --> 15:17.200
(Derek) THERE'LL PROBABLY BE
SOME BURN VICTIMS.

15:17.233 --> 15:19.300
YOU SHOULD BE PREPARED.

15:25.100 --> 15:27.100
OH.
OH. (laughs)

15:27.133 --> 15:28.133
OH, SYDNEY. (chuckles)

15:28.167 --> 15:30.767
I-I THOUGHT I COULD TAKE
A FEW PATIENTS OFF YOUR...

15:30.800 --> 15:31.967
UH...
HANDS.

15:32.067 --> 15:34.067
I APPRECIATE THE GESTURE,
DR. CALLIE O'MALLEY. (laughs)

15:34.100 --> 15:37.533
BUT THE CHIEF ASKED ME TO ROLL
THE NONEMERGENT E.R. CASES

15:37.567 --> 15:40.167
INTO THE CLINIC
AND TAKE CARE OF THEM,

15:40.200 --> 15:41.533
SO I'VE TRIAGED
THESE PATIENTS,

15:41.567 --> 15:43.533
AND SO FAR IT LOOKS LIKE A--
A SORE THROAT, A SPRAIN

15:43.567 --> 15:45.300
AND A TUMMY ACHE--
EASY BREEZY.

15:45.333 --> 15:47.233
SO THE CLINIC AND I
ARE FINE.

15:47.267 --> 15:49.733
OKAY, I'M NOT, UH, TRYING
TO TAKE THE CLINIC--

15:49.767 --> 15:52.200
UH, BAILEY'S CLINIC,
BY THE WAY--AWAY FROM YOU.

15:52.233 --> 15:53.667
I'M OFFERING TO HELP,
SO...

15:53.700 --> 15:55.667
YOUR OFFER TO HELP
IS DULY NOTED

15:55.700 --> 15:57.733
AND VERY MUCH APPRECIATED,
BUT I PROMISE YOU--

15:57.767 --> 16:01.067
GOT IT ALL UNDER CONTROL.
SO... JASON KAYE?

16:01.100 --> 16:02.500
FINE.

16:02.533 --> 16:05.233
I'LL LEAVE YOU TO IT
AND, UH, FIND MYSELF

16:05.267 --> 16:07.367
A RECENTLY TRAUMATIZED
EMERGENCY SURGERY

16:07.400 --> 16:08.600
TO SCRUB IN ON

16:08.633 --> 16:11.333
WHILE YOU STAY DOWN HERE
WITH YOUR SORE THROAT

16:11.367 --> 16:14.133
AND YOUR SPRAIN AND--
WHAT WAS THE OTHER ONE?

16:14.167 --> 16:16.067
TUMMY ACHE.

16:16.100 --> 16:18.067
OOH. (laughs)

16:18.067 --> 16:20.533
(chuckles) MM.

16:22.500 --> 16:24.467
JASON KAYE?

16:24.500 --> 16:27.400
(ship horns blowing)

16:27.433 --> 16:30.333
(sirens wailing)

16:32.533 --> 16:35.167
EXCUSE ME, ARE YOU A NURSE,
A DOCTOR,

16:35.200 --> 16:37.067
M-MEDICAL SOMETHING?
I'M A DOCTOR, BUT--

16:37.100 --> 16:38.833
ALL RIGHT, COME WITH ME.
UM, NO, YOU--YOU NEED
TO GET CHECKED OUT.

16:38.867 --> 16:41.700
THERE'S A TREATMENT AREA
RIGHT OVER THERE.
FOLLOW ME, PLEASE.

16:41.733 --> 16:43.367
YOU'VE GOT SOME REALLY BAD
BURNS. THEY NEED TO BE TREATED.

16:43.400 --> 16:45.633
MY BUDDY'S TRAPPED.
HE'S TRAPPED UNDER A CAR.

16:45.667 --> 16:47.800
IF HE'S TRAPPED UNDER A CAR,
YOU NEED SEARCH AND RESCUE.

16:47.833 --> 16:50.433
THEY HAVE--THEY HAVE PERSONNEL--
THEIR MEDICAL PERSONNEL--

16:50.467 --> 16:52.400
I CALLED THEM. THEY'RE
BACKED UP, AND HE CAN'T WAIT.

16:52.433 --> 16:54.333
HE'S IN A REAL BAD WAY.
PLEASE. HE'S MY BEST BUDDY.

16:54.367 --> 16:56.300
PLEASE.

16:56.333 --> 17:00.600
(sirens wailing)

17:00.633 --> 17:02.533
SHEPHERD, I NEED YOU
IN THE NEXT RIG.
OKAY.

17:02.567 --> 17:04.467
I WANT YOU AT THAT SCENE.
YOU DON'T NEED ME HERE?

17:04.500 --> 17:07.100
THEY'RE REPORTING LOTS
OF CLOSED HEAD INJURIES.

17:07.133 --> 17:09.833
I WANT YOU TO GET IN THERE
AND BRING 'EM BACK ALIVE.

17:09.867 --> 17:11.500
OKAY, WHAT'S THE NEWS?

17:11.533 --> 17:13.333
SHEPHERD AND GREY
ARE ON THE ROCKS.

17:13.367 --> 17:16.300
BURKE AND YANG
GOT ENGAGED.

17:21.500 --> 17:23.767
YOU NEED HIGHLIGHTS.

17:23.800 --> 17:25.733
IN YOUR HAIR--

17:25.767 --> 17:28.800
THAT'S WHY IT LOOKS
SO ODD.

17:28.833 --> 17:31.433
I'M GONNA GO SAVE LIVES.

17:37.733 --> 17:39.633
TAKE HIM
TO THE TREATMENT AREA.

17:39.667 --> 17:42.133
THEY'LL FIX YOU UP
THERE, OKAY?

17:42.167 --> 17:46.200
(siren wailing)

17:46.233 --> 17:48.300
(bell dings)

17:48.333 --> 17:51.733
I GOT SOMEBODY DOWN HERE.

17:54.133 --> 17:56.067
(man) HEY!

17:56.067 --> 17:57.567
THAT'S NOT SECURE.

17:59.300 --> 18:01.233
HEY!

18:06.167 --> 18:08.800
(pants)

18:08.833 --> 18:10.733
DOCTOR, I NEED YOU
TO GET BACK UP HERE.

18:10.767 --> 18:13.200
THERE'S A PREGNANT WOMAN
DOWN HERE! JUST SHUT THE...

18:13.233 --> 18:14.700
OH, HELL.

18:14.733 --> 18:16.633

18:18.367 --> 18:19.500
YEAH.

18:24.300 --> 18:25.600
(whimpers)

18:28.267 --> 18:30.167
(breathes raspily)

18:30.200 --> 18:31.267
(whimpers)

18:33.800 --> 18:35.467
(whimpering)

18:35.500 --> 18:36.767
ONE SECOND.

18:36.800 --> 18:39.067
HOLD ON. HOLD ON.

18:39.100 --> 18:41.567
(grunts)

18:46.700 --> 18:49.200
(whimpers)

18:49.233 --> 18:52.067
IMMEDIATE! IMMEDIATE!
I NEED HELP DOWN HERE!
(whimpers)

18:55.867 --> 18:58.167
HE'S BACK. HE'S GOT HELP.

18:58.200 --> 19:01.567
YOU HEAR THAT, RICK?
WE GOT HELP.

19:01.600 --> 19:04.467
WE GOT A DOCTOR.
YOU'LL BE OKAY NOW, MAN.

19:04.500 --> 19:06.433
HE'S GONNA BE OKAY?

19:07.633 --> 19:10.367
RIGHT?

19:20.300 --> 19:22.200
(man) WHAT WE DO KNOW
AT THIS TIME--

19:22.233 --> 19:24.267
WHAT WE CAN TELL YOU--IS THAT
THERE HAVE BEEN DEATHS.

19:24.300 --> 19:26.600
WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY...
THANK YOU. I'LL UTILIZE
ALL OF IT. HOLD ON.

19:26.633 --> 19:28.500
AND WE MAY NOT KNOW THAT
FOR HOURS, EVEN DAYS.

19:28.533 --> 19:31.167
WE ALSO KNOW THAT PASSENGERS
ARE STILL BEING EVACUATED...

19:31.200 --> 19:35.700
ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE GONNA NEED
THESE TO HANDLE THE INFLUX.

19:35.733 --> 19:38.333
WE'RE GONNA NEED PLENTY OF
AVAILABLE OPEN CHEST TRAYS,

19:38.367 --> 19:39.700
CENTRAL LINE KITS

19:39.733 --> 19:41.633
AND A DIFFICULT
INTUBATION CART.
YES, SIR.

19:41.667 --> 19:44.533
BUT WITH THE FIRE AND THE SMOKE
AND WHO KNOWS WHAT DAMAGE

19:44.567 --> 19:46.400
TO THE INTERIOR, WE DON'T...
OH, YANG.

19:46.433 --> 19:49.333
I-I KNOW. UM, COMMUNICATE
WITH THE SCENE AS NEEDED.

19:49.367 --> 19:50.833
NO.

19:50.867 --> 19:52.800
I HEARD YOU WERE ENGAGED.

19:52.833 --> 19:54.200
CONGRATULATIONS.

19:54.233 --> 19:56.100
THANK YOU, SIR.

19:56.133 --> 19:58.100
ALL RIGHT, GO,
AND REMEMBER,

19:58.133 --> 20:01.167
WE'RE HOPING FOR THE BEST
BUT PREPARING FOR THE WORST.

20:01.200 --> 20:02.600
RIGHT.

20:02.633 --> 20:05.500
(police radio chatter)

20:05.533 --> 20:08.067
(siren wails)

20:08.100 --> 20:10.333
(siren whoops)

20:10.367 --> 20:11.800
YOU GOT ANYONE FOR ME?

20:11.833 --> 20:14.067
UH, YEAH, THOSE TWO
NEED TO BE TRANSPORTED.

20:14.100 --> 20:17.033
UH, THESE FIVE DIDN'T MAKE IT--
FOUR ADULTS AND ONE CHILD.

20:17.067 --> 20:19.700
A CHILD?
YOU FOUND A DEAD CHILD?

20:19.733 --> 20:22.833
A BOY OR GIRL?
MA'AM, YOU'RE INJURED.
YOU NEED TO LIE DOWN.

20:22.867 --> 20:25.133
GET A STRETCHER, NOW.
IS THE CHILD
A BOY OR A GIRL?

20:25.167 --> 20:27.100
I CAN'T FIND MY SON.
WE GOT SEPARATED.

20:27.133 --> 20:30.133
I-I NEED TO KNOW
IF MY LITTLE BOY IS ALIVE.

20:30.167 --> 20:32.133
SHE WAS A GIRL.
THE CHILD WAS A LITTLE GIRL.

20:32.167 --> 20:34.067
NO, NO, NO, NO.
I NEED TO EXAMINE YOU.

20:34.100 --> 20:36.133
I'M GONNA HAVE TO TAKE YOU
TO THE HOSPITAL.
NO, I CAN'T LEAVE!

20:36.167 --> 20:38.500
HE'S ONLY 7. NO!
AND--AND HE'S ALL ALONE.
NO.

20:38.533 --> 20:40.433
NO, I WILL NOT LEAVE
MY SON BEHIND. NO!

20:40.467 --> 20:42.067
NO, I WILL FIND HIM.
LISTEN TO ME.

20:42.100 --> 20:43.600
I WILL FIND HIM.

20:43.633 --> 20:45.533
IF YOU LET ME
TAKE YOU TO TRIAGE,

20:45.567 --> 20:47.600
I PROMISE YOU
I WILL FIND YOUR SON.

20:47.633 --> 20:49.667
HE'S SO SCARED.

20:49.700 --> 20:51.200
YEAH, I KNOW. I KNOW.

20:51.233 --> 20:52.800
I'LL FIND HIM.

20:52.833 --> 20:54.500
OKAY.
OKAY?

20:54.533 --> 20:56.200
ALL RIGHT.

20:59.100 --> 21:00.833
HE'S A MECHANIC.
WE--WE WORK TOGETHER.

21:00.867 --> 21:02.800
WE--WE DRIVE TOGETHER
TO WORK,

21:02.833 --> 21:04.700
AND--AND SUDDENLY
THERE WAS THIS HUGE JOLT.

21:04.733 --> 21:07.067
IT WAS AWFUL. WE WERE JUST
TRYING TO GET OUTTA THERE.

21:07.100 --> 21:09.500
BUT RICK WENT BACK IN--
FIGURED WE COULD HELP.
WE SHOULD HELP.

21:09.533 --> 21:11.433
HE WENT BACK.
THERE WERE PEOPLE TRAPPED.

21:11.467 --> 21:14.067
HE WAS TRYING TO HELP.
WE WERE BEHIND HIM.
WE--WE WERE RIGHT BEHIND HIM.

21:14.067 --> 21:15.400
THERE'S INJURIES
TO HIS CHEST AND LEG.

21:15.433 --> 21:17.300
IT LOOKS LIKE
HIS ARM IS BROKEN,

21:17.333 --> 21:19.233
AND I'D GUESS THERE'S DAMAGE
TO HIS SPINE AND PELVIS.

21:19.267 --> 21:21.267
I CAN'T--THERE'S--
THERE'S NOT MUCH THAT I CAN DO

21:21.300 --> 21:24.067
UNTIL WE GET HIM OUT OF HERE.

21:24.100 --> 21:26.567
YOU GOTTA DO WHAT YOU CAN.

21:26.600 --> 21:28.433
I MEAN, WE'LL, UH...

21:28.467 --> 21:31.633
GREG, GO FIND SOME MORE GUYS.

21:31.667 --> 21:34.500
HEY, GO FIND
SEARCH AND RESCUE, OKAY?

21:34.533 --> 21:37.500
GIVE THEM THIS. TELL THEM
I SAID HE CAN'T WAIT.

21:37.533 --> 21:40.333
HE HAS TO GET TO A HOSPITAL.
ALL RIGHT, I'M GOING.

21:40.367 --> 21:43.300
***

21:43.333 --> 21:45.067
(Derek) LET 'EM KNOW
HE NEEDS A C.T.

21:45.100 --> 21:47.233
MAKE SURE TO KEEP HIS NECK
STABLE. I FELT A STEP OFF.

21:47.267 --> 21:49.167
ASK FOR WALLER.
IF WALLER'S NOT AVAILABLE,

21:49.200 --> 21:50.700
ASK FOR KRYCHEK, OKAY?

21:50.733 --> 21:52.700
KEEP HIM STABLE.
WHAT DO YOU GOT?

21:52.733 --> 21:55.400
OH, HEY, NURSE, LET ME HAVE SOME
BANDAGES. THANK YOU. STOP HERE.
DEREK.

21:55.433 --> 21:57.333
HEY, MEREDITH,
YOU GOT A FREE HAND?

21:57.367 --> 21:59.833
HOLD THIS BANDAGE FOR ME,
WILL YOU?
YEAH.

21:59.867 --> 22:01.500
YOU ALL RIGHT?
YEAH, IT'S JUST A LOT.

22:01.533 --> 22:04.400
DO YOU WANT TO GET MARRIED,
AND YOU HAVEN'T TOLD ME

22:04.433 --> 22:07.233
AND I HAVEN'T ASKED,
SO NOW WE HAVE A PROBLEM?

22:07.267 --> 22:09.167
WHAT? NO, I DON'T WANT
TO GET MARRIED.

22:09.200 --> 22:11.233
YOU WANT TO GET MARRIED?
NO. GOOD.

22:11.267 --> 22:13.433
SO IF THAT'S NOT IT,
WHAT IS IT?

22:13.467 --> 22:16.500
IT ISN'T ANYTHING.

22:16.533 --> 22:19.367
ARE YOU GOOD? 'CAUSE I GOTTA
GET THIS KID TRIAGED.

22:19.400 --> 22:22.533
YEAH, I'M GOOD. OKAY.
LET'S GO. SHE ALL RIGHT?
YEAH, SHE'S GOOD.

22:22.567 --> 22:24.567
SHE'S JUST LOST.
HANG IN THERE.

22:24.600 --> 22:30.067
***

22:30.100 --> 22:31.833
ALL THE NONEMERGENT SURGERIES
HAVE BEEN POSTPONED.

22:31.867 --> 22:33.200
(Richard) GOOD.

22:33.233 --> 22:35.133
I'M GONNA GO
CHECK ON DISCHARGES.

22:35.167 --> 22:38.567
I'M TRYING TO FREE UP
AS MANY BEDS AS I CAN

22:38.600 --> 22:39.767
IN THE SURGICAL WING.

22:39.800 --> 22:42.467
OH. I WAS GONNA
DO THAT, BUT--
I CAN DO IT.

22:42.500 --> 22:44.400
OH, SURE. GOOD.

22:44.433 --> 22:46.267
UNLESS YOU WANT TO.

22:46.300 --> 22:48.133
NO, NO. GO AHEAD.
YOU'RE STILL THE CHIEF.

22:48.167 --> 22:51.333
I KNOW THAT.

22:51.367 --> 22:53.567
IT JUST SEEMS SO QUIET,
YOU KNOW?

22:53.600 --> 22:55.500
YEAH. WE'RE EXPECTING
THE FIRST WAVE

22:55.533 --> 22:57.667
FROM THE SCENE SOON.

22:57.700 --> 23:00.667
***

23:05.433 --> 23:09.267
I DYED MY HAIR BLONDE...

23:09.300 --> 23:12.133
THE DAY AFTER
DEREK MOVED OUT.

23:12.167 --> 23:14.367
CHANGE IS GOOD.

23:14.400 --> 23:16.700
YOUR MARRIAGE IS OVER.
YOU'RE--

23:16.733 --> 23:19.167
YOU'RE STARTING OVER.

23:19.200 --> 23:21.533
SO AM I.

23:25.867 --> 23:27.567
RIGHT.

23:27.600 --> 23:31.067
***

23:33.533 --> 23:35.067
I SPECIFICALLY TOLD YOU

23:35.067 --> 23:37.067
I NEEDED
TO TELL MEREDITH FIRST.

23:37.100 --> 23:39.800
I WAS TALKING TO SHEPHERD,
AND... IT JUST CAME OUT.

23:39.833 --> 23:42.267
IT WAS NO BIG DEAL.

23:42.300 --> 23:44.600
IT IS A BIG DEAL,
BECAUSE NOW SHE'S NOT EVEN

23:44.633 --> 23:46.500
GONNA CARE ABOUT THE FACT
THAT I'M GETTING MARRIED.

23:46.533 --> 23:49.300
ALL SHE'S GONNA CARE ABOUT
IS THE FACT THAT

23:49.333 --> 23:51.700
I DIDN'T TELL HER MYSELF.
THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU?

23:51.733 --> 23:54.233
THERE WAS A MAJOR DISASTER.

23:54.267 --> 23:57.233
THAT WAS 45 MINUTES
AFTER WE DISCUSSED IT.

23:57.267 --> 23:59.167
YOU WERE WITH YOUR FRIENDS
FOR 45 MINUTES

23:59.200 --> 24:00.433
RUNNING TRIAGE DRILLS,

24:00.467 --> 24:02.800
AND YOU WEREN'T COMPELLED
TO MENTION IT?

24:04.200 --> 24:07.533
THE CHIEF SAYS THEY'RE
ROLLING IN SOON, SO...

24:09.800 --> 24:11.267
HER PRESSURE'S LOW--
BARELY REGISTERING--

24:11.300 --> 24:13.567
AND I DON'T SEE ANY GOOD VEINS
FOR AN I.V.

24:13.600 --> 24:15.500
SHE'S ALL CLAMPED DOWN
FROM HYPOTHERMIA.

24:15.533 --> 24:17.400
THAT'S WHY I COULDN'T
FIND A PULSE.

24:17.433 --> 24:19.767
I'VE NEVER SEEN A CRUSH INJURY
SO BAD AND SURVIVE.

24:19.800 --> 24:21.733
SHE NEEDS TO STAY
ON HER LEFT SIDE.

24:21.767 --> 24:23.667
WE GOTTA MOVE HER
ON HER LEFT SIDE.

24:23.700 --> 24:26.567
IT'S GONNA TAKE BOTH OF US.
WE GOTTA GET THAT B.P. UP.

24:26.600 --> 24:28.433
ON MY COUNT.

24:28.467 --> 24:29.633
ONE...

24:29.667 --> 24:32.533
TWO...

24:32.567 --> 24:34.467
(monitor beeping erratically)
YOUR BABY--

24:34.500 --> 24:37.300
YOUR BABY'S OKAY.
FOR NOW IT LOOKS OKAY.

24:37.333 --> 24:38.667
JUST TRY TO BREATHE.

24:38.700 --> 24:41.467
WE NEED TO MOVE YOU TO HELP
WITH YOUR CIRCULATION, OKAY?

24:41.500 --> 24:42.733
(mumbles)

24:42.767 --> 24:45.667
ONE, TWO, THREE.

24:45.700 --> 24:47.800
(beeping continues)

24:47.833 --> 24:49.667
PULSE IS ALREADY BETTER.

24:49.700 --> 24:51.600
I'LL ATTEMPT
I.V. ACCESS AGAIN.

24:51.633 --> 24:53.500
JUST BREATHE THROUGH
THE PAIN.

24:53.533 --> 24:55.433
WHAT YOU CAN DO
FOR YOUR BABY RIGHT NOW

24:55.467 --> 24:58.400
IS TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF.
GOOD GIRL. I KNOW IT HURTS.

24:58.433 --> 25:02.133
COME ON NOW.
KEEP BREATHING FOR ME, OKAY?

25:02.167 --> 25:05.067
THAT'S IT. BREATHE.

25:19.167 --> 25:21.267
GOOD.

25:21.300 --> 25:22.833
UM, WHAT DO WE...

25:22.867 --> 25:24.333
SO WHAT DO WE DO?

25:24.367 --> 25:25.667
WE WAIT.

25:25.700 --> 25:28.600
(door opens)

25:30.567 --> 25:32.567
WE WAIT?

25:32.600 --> 25:36.100
WE WAIT.

25:36.133 --> 25:39.400
(sirens wailing)

25:39.433 --> 25:43.100
(sirens growing louder)

25:43.133 --> 25:45.467
OKAY, WE NEED TO FIND
A GROWN-UP--

25:45.500 --> 25:47.067
ANOTHER GROWN-UP--

25:47.067 --> 25:50.067
TO HELP YOU
FIND YOUR MOM.

25:57.800 --> 26:00.267
HEY, UH, I NEED YOU
TO TAKE THIS LITTLE GIRL

26:00.300 --> 26:03.267
TO THE TRIAGE TENTS.
I GOTTA GET BACK TO MY UNIT.

26:03.300 --> 26:05.200
NO, I NEED YOU TO TAKE
THIS LITTLE GIRL

26:05.233 --> 26:08.100
TO THE TRIAGE TENTS
FOR ME, PLEASE.

26:08.133 --> 26:10.067
YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY.
YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE.

26:10.067 --> 26:12.767
I PROMISE, OKAY?
THANKS.

26:16.733 --> 26:20.500
(man) HELP! I NEED
SOME HELP OVER HERE!

26:20.533 --> 26:22.067
STAY RIGHT HERE.

26:22.067 --> 26:25.633
(sirens wailing)

26:28.233 --> 26:30.533
(police radio chatter)

26:30.567 --> 26:32.467
(Derek) HOW WE DOING?
IT'S BAD.

26:32.500 --> 26:35.200
A LOT OF SURVIVORS,
SO THAT'S SOMETHING.
YEAH, IT IS.

26:35.233 --> 26:36.733
HAVE YOU SEEN STEVENS?
NO.

26:36.767 --> 26:38.100
WHAT ABOUT O'MALLEY, GREY?

26:38.133 --> 26:40.067
GREY WAS--I SAW GREY
ABOUT TEN MINUTES AGO.

26:40.067 --> 26:41.800
SHE WAS ON HER WAY OVER HERE
WITH A KID.

26:41.833 --> 26:43.500
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN HER?

26:43.533 --> 26:45.267
NO. I GOTTA HEAD OUT
WITH THIS ONE,

26:45.300 --> 26:47.500
SO KEEP AN EYE OUT
FOR MY INTERNS, ALL RIGHT?

26:47.533 --> 26:49.167
YEAH, I'LL DO MY BEST.

26:57.800 --> 27:00.067
(Alex) JANE DOE,
ABOUT SIX MONTHS PREGNANT,

27:00.067 --> 27:02.233
FOUND UNDER A PILE OF RUBBLE.
SHE SUSTAINED CRUSH INJURIES

27:02.267 --> 27:04.167
TO HER RIGHT TORSO
AND UPPER EXTREMITIES

27:04.200 --> 27:06.433
AS WELL AS SEVERE TRAUMA
TO THE FACE.

27:06.467 --> 27:08.367
B.P. INITIALLY LOW,
BUT NOW UP TO 90 OVER 60

27:08.400 --> 27:09.600
AFTER A LITER OF FLUID

27:09.633 --> 27:12.233
AND PLACING HER
ON HER LEFT SIDE.
WHAT DO WE DO? KAREV?

27:12.267 --> 27:14.533
ABC--HER AIRWAY
NEEDS TO BE PROTECTED.

27:14.567 --> 27:16.400
HER BREATHING
WILL BE COMPROMISED

27:16.433 --> 27:18.500
BECAUSE OF THE CRUSH INJURY,
AND WE NEED

27:18.533 --> 27:20.067
TO HAVE BLOOD AVAILABLE.

27:20.100 --> 27:22.233
I WOULD DO A TRAUMA PANEL,
TYPE AND CROSS

27:22.267 --> 27:25.133
AND C.T.s OF HER HEAD AND NECK.
EXCELLENT.
LET'S GET HER STARTED.

27:25.167 --> 27:28.100
UH, TRAUMA ROOM TWO.
LET'S GO. ONE, TWO AND THREE.

27:28.133 --> 27:30.300
(Richard) LET'S SEE
WHAT WE HAVE HERE.

27:30.333 --> 27:32.367
OKAY.

27:35.767 --> 27:38.833
THE BABY--
THE BABY'S GONNA--
MAKE SURE THAT YOU
SHIELD HER IN RADIOLOGY.

27:38.867 --> 27:40.767
WE'VE GOT TO
GET HER STABILIZED FIRST

27:40.800 --> 27:43.767
BEFORE YOU START WORRYING
ABOUT THE BABY.

27:43.800 --> 27:46.233
THE AMOUNT OF RADS
ARE NEGLIGIBLE.
RIGHT, BUT SHE'S
GONNA NEED A LOT

27:46.267 --> 27:49.067
BEFORE ALL OF THIS IS OVER.
WE NEED TO PROTECT THEM BOTH.

27:49.067 --> 27:51.700
YANG, YOU'RE ON THIS.
ALEX, GO TO THE CLINIC.

27:51.733 --> 27:54.233
THE VICTIMS' FAMILIES ARE THERE.
THEY NEED ANSWERS.

27:54.267 --> 27:56.400
THIS IS MY PATIENT. I PULLED
HER OUT OF THE DAMN WATER.

27:56.433 --> 27:58.667
WHICH IS HEROIC AND MANLY,
AND YOU STILL NEED

27:58.700 --> 28:01.433
TO TALK TO THOSE FAMILIES
RIGHT NOW.
WHY CAN'T YANG DO IT?

28:01.467 --> 28:06.067
THIS IS ALL HANDS ON DECK.
YANG CAN HANDLE THIS. NOW GO.

28:10.600 --> 28:13.733
(Richard) LET'S CHECK THEM
AND SEE...

28:17.300 --> 28:20.167
HE LIKES
FIRE TRUCKS... (grunts)

28:20.200 --> 28:22.133
AND POLICE CARS--
ANYTHING WITH FLASHING LIGHTS.
(George) OKAY.

28:22.167 --> 28:24.567
CARLEE HEIT, 45-YEAR-OLD FEMALE,
FOUND AT THE SCENE.

28:24.600 --> 28:27.200
OPEN ABDOMINAL WOUND
WITH OMENTAL EVISCERATION.

28:27.233 --> 28:29.833
OKAY, WE NEED TO GET HER
TO AN O.R. AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

28:29.867 --> 28:31.800
HE WON'T RESPOND
IF YOU CALL HIM CHRISTOPHER.

28:31.833 --> 28:34.067
HE HATES THAT.
JUST CHRIS.
OKAY.

28:34.067 --> 28:36.100
HE LIKES CHRIS THE BEST.
OKAY.

28:36.133 --> 28:39.267
O'MALLEY, WHAT IS SHE
TALKING ABOUT?
SHE LOST TRACK OF HER SON
IN THE ACCIDENT.

28:39.300 --> 28:42.267
DR. O'MALLEY AND I MADE A DEAL.
HE'S GONNA FIND MY SON

28:42.300 --> 28:44.200
SO I KNOW THAT CHRIS IS OKAY
BEFORE I GO INTO SURGERY.

28:44.233 --> 28:46.133
MRS. HEIT, YOUR INJURY'S
EXTREMELY SERIOUS.

28:46.167 --> 28:49.167
WE NEED TO TEND TO IT
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
AS SOON AS HE'S LOCATED.

28:49.200 --> 28:51.800
I CAN'T GO INTO SURGERY
BEFORE I KNOW ABOUT MY SON.
I'M SURE HE'S HERE.
ALL FAMILIES ARE BEING DIR--

28:51.833 --> 28:53.667
O'MALLEY, JUST FIND THE BOY
IN A HURRY,

28:53.700 --> 28:55.633
AND WE'LL START THE WORKUP.

28:59.533 --> 29:02.400
(panting)

29:02.433 --> 29:05.333
(paper rustling)

29:16.667 --> 29:19.567
(moaning)

29:19.600 --> 29:20.633
I NEED MORE GAUZE.

29:20.667 --> 29:22.533
THERE'S NO MORE HERE.

29:22.567 --> 29:24.467
MAYBE YOU COULD FIND

29:24.500 --> 29:26.433
SOME, UH, PAPER TOWELS
IN THE HEAD?

29:26.467 --> 29:27.800
I'LL FIND SOMETHING.

29:27.833 --> 29:29.733
VINCE... VINCE,
IT HURTS LIKE HELL.

29:29.767 --> 29:31.667
CAN YOU DO ANYTHING
ABOUT THAT?

29:31.700 --> 29:33.600
I MEAN, CAN--YOU GOT
ANYTHING FOR THE PAIN?

29:33.633 --> 29:35.533
I'VE GIVEN HIM
EVERYTHING I'VE GOT.

29:35.567 --> 29:37.633
WHERE IS SEARCH AND RESCUE?
IT HURTS.

29:37.667 --> 29:39.300
WHAT HURTS, MAN?

29:42.267 --> 29:44.433
E-EVERYTHING.

29:44.467 --> 29:46.367
MAYBE IF--MAYBE IF
I TRY TO SET HIS ARM,

29:46.400 --> 29:48.700
IT'LL HELP SOME
WITH THE PAIN.
WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?

29:48.733 --> 29:50.233
I, UH, UM...

29:50.267 --> 29:52.333
WHAT?
NOTHING. JUST, UH,

29:52.367 --> 29:54.267
JUST STAY THERE
AND HOLD HIS HAND.

29:54.300 --> 29:56.067
HOLD HIS HAND?

29:56.100 --> 29:58.733
YOU THINK HE'S IN PAIN NOW?
HE'S NOT. HOLD HIS HAND.

29:58.767 --> 30:01.367
PLACE BOTH HANDS ON OPPOSITE
SIDES OF THE FRACTURE...

30:01.400 --> 30:03.067
DISTRACT,

30:03.100 --> 30:04.800
EXAGGERATE

30:04.833 --> 30:08.133
AND REVERSE THE MECHANISM
IN ONE CONTINUOUS MOTION.

30:08.167 --> 30:10.833
YOU ARE A DOCTOR,
AREN'T YOU?

30:10.867 --> 30:12.367
SHUT UP.

30:12.400 --> 30:15.267
ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.
RICK, YOU READY?

30:15.300 --> 30:16.633
(breathes rapidly)

30:16.667 --> 30:18.600
YEAH.

30:22.267 --> 30:23.733
ONE...

30:27.333 --> 30:30.467
TWO...

30:34.467 --> 30:36.700
(bone cracks)
AAH!

30:36.733 --> 30:39.400
(groaning)
WHAT HAPPENED?

30:39.433 --> 30:42.067
SOME METAL--
SOMETHING IN MY LEG...

30:42.100 --> 30:44.500
THROWN OFF.
GOD, IT HURTS. IT HURTS.
OKAY.

30:44.533 --> 30:47.700
I STARTED SWIMMING.
I NEEDED TO GO...

30:47.733 --> 30:50.533
GOT A MEETING.

30:50.567 --> 30:52.767
AAH!

30:52.800 --> 30:55.500
I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY, SIR.
BUT TRY TO STAY STILL.

30:55.533 --> 30:57.767
OH. OH.

30:57.800 --> 31:00.700
(man groaning)

31:09.467 --> 31:11.533
DON'T LOOK. TURN AROUND.

31:15.167 --> 31:17.767
I NEED YOU
TO BE BRAVE FOR ME.

31:17.800 --> 31:21.600
JUST STAND RIGHT THERE
AND DON'T MOVE AND DON'T LOOK.

31:32.200 --> 31:33.700
WHAT DO WE GOT?

31:33.733 --> 31:35.633
OH, WE JUST GOT STARTED.

31:35.667 --> 31:37.333
ALL RIGHT.

31:37.367 --> 31:39.067
BUT I GOT THIS.

31:39.067 --> 31:41.700
THERE'S NOBODY COVERING
MY SERVICE.

31:41.733 --> 31:44.067
I'M GONNA NEED YOU
TO GET UP TO TELEMETRY

31:44.067 --> 31:46.500
AND CHECK ON MY PATIENTS,
PRE-OP AND POST-OP.

31:46.533 --> 31:48.433
AND THEN I SHOULD
JOIN YOU IN SURGERY?

31:48.467 --> 31:51.067
NO. AND THEN YOU SHOULD
REPORT TO THE PIT.

31:51.100 --> 31:52.833
UH, THE CHIEF ASSIGNED ME
TO JANE DOE.

31:52.867 --> 31:54.433
YES.
NOW I'M REASSIGNING YOU.

31:54.467 --> 31:56.233
TO DO WHAT, SUTURES?

31:56.267 --> 31:58.167
YES.

31:58.200 --> 32:00.067
OKAY, SO--SO YOU'RE SAYING
YOU DON'T--

32:00.100 --> 32:02.600
YOU DON'T WANT ME
TO SCRUB IN.

32:02.633 --> 32:04.533
DR. YANG, I'M SAYING
THAT I HAVE

32:04.567 --> 32:06.500
AN UNATTENDED
CARDIOTHORACIC WING

32:06.533 --> 32:08.533
AND A PIT FULL OF PATIENTS

32:08.567 --> 32:10.467
THAT YOU HAVE
THE ABILITY TO HELP.

32:10.500 --> 32:14.067
I DON'T NEED YOU IN THE O.R.
I NEED YOU ON THE FLOOR.

32:14.100 --> 32:15.833
DO YOU HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH THAT?

32:15.867 --> 32:17.767
NO.

32:17.800 --> 32:19.333
THANK YOU.

32:23.300 --> 32:25.267

32:25.300 --> 32:26.800
CHRIS HEIT.

32:26.833 --> 32:28.633
HE'S 7 YEARS OLD.
HE'S GOT BROWN HAIR.

32:28.667 --> 32:31.600
I DON'T KNOW IF HE'S INJURED.
I'M...

32:31.633 --> 32:35.133
COULD YOU AT LEAST
CHECK TO SEE IF HE'S THERE?

32:35.167 --> 32:37.300
YES, I KNOW ALL THE FAMILIES
WERE DIRECTED HERE.

32:37.333 --> 32:39.233
COULD YOU JUST CHECK?
THANK YOU. YEAH.

32:39.267 --> 32:42.167
CALLIE, I NEED SOME HELP.

32:42.200 --> 32:44.067
I CAN'T. I'M BUSY.

32:44.067 --> 32:47.100
YEAH, OKAY. IT'S JUST, UH,
I'M TRYING TO FIND THIS--
GEORGE, I'M BUSY.

32:47.133 --> 32:49.667
I'M ABOUT TO GO
INTO SURGERY, OKAY?

32:49.700 --> 32:52.733
I CAN'T BE YOUR WIFE
RIGHT NOW. I'M WORKING.
I'M WORKING, TOO. I HAVE
A PATIENT WHO NEEDS SURGERY.

32:52.767 --> 32:55.067
SO DO I.

32:55.100 --> 32:57.167
YES, ANY LUCK?

32:57.200 --> 32:59.633
THANK YOU.

32:59.667 --> 33:02.133
OKAY.

33:02.167 --> 33:03.367
DAMN IT.

33:07.167 --> 33:10.067
CAN I GET SOME HELP
OVER HERE?

33:12.067 --> 33:16.500
SWEETIE, LISTEN TO ME.
I NEED YOU TO TURN AROUND.

33:16.533 --> 33:18.633
I KNOW I TOLD YOU
TO FACE AWAY FROM ME,

33:18.667 --> 33:21.533
BUT WE HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER
TO HELP THIS MAN.

33:23.333 --> 33:26.500
I DON'T TALK EITHER
WHEN I GET SCARED.

33:26.533 --> 33:28.833
I DON'T... TALK

33:28.867 --> 33:31.333
WHEN BAD THINGS HAPPEN.

33:31.367 --> 33:33.267
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
SAY ANYTHING.

33:33.300 --> 33:36.233
BUT I NEED YOUR HELP.

33:42.400 --> 33:45.233
OKAY, DON'T LOOK DOWN.
DON'T LOOK AT THE BLOOD.

33:45.267 --> 33:48.233
LOOK AT ME.
LOOK AT ME.

33:48.267 --> 33:51.167
CAN YOU BE MY ASSISTANT?

33:51.200 --> 33:52.700
OKAY, GOOD.

33:52.733 --> 33:55.600
I CAN'T MOVE MY HANDS
OFF WHERE THEY ARE RIGHT NOW.

33:55.633 --> 33:57.533
SO I NEED YOU
TO GO OVER TO MY KIT

33:57.567 --> 33:59.100
AND PULL OUT, UH,
THE THINGS--

33:59.133 --> 34:01.633
THEY LOOK LIKE, UM,
LIKE TWEEZERS.

34:01.667 --> 34:05.667
YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR MOMMY USES
TO PULL A SPLINTER OUT WITH?

34:10.367 --> 34:12.267
HEY, WHAT WAS
THE SITE LIKE?

34:12.300 --> 34:15.067
WAS IT GORY?
WAS IT A TRAUMA BONANZA?

34:15.100 --> 34:17.767
I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY TERRIBLE.

34:17.800 --> 34:19.833
I DON'T TALK WITH THIEVES.

34:19.867 --> 34:23.667
WHAT?
YOU STOLE MY JANE DOE
RIGHT OUT FROM UNDER ME.

34:23.700 --> 34:25.533
I AM NOT A THIEF.
YOU BALKED. YOU'RE A BALKER.

34:25.567 --> 34:26.767
I WAS THINKING.

34:26.800 --> 34:28.800
WELL, AGAIN, NOT MY PROBLEM
THAT THINKING

34:28.833 --> 34:31.433
IS SUCH A TIME-CONSUMING
PROCESS FOR YOU.
I RESCUED HER.

34:31.467 --> 34:33.333
I CLIMBED DOWN. I PULLED
A MASSIVE PYLON OFF OF HER.

34:33.367 --> 34:36.167
I GOT HER HERE ALIVE.
PYLONS?
THERE ARE PYLONS ON PEOPLE?

34:36.200 --> 34:38.133
WHATEVER.
NOW I GET STUCK

34:38.167 --> 34:39.300
BABYSITTING
THE PATIENTS' FAMILIES

34:39.333 --> 34:42.500
WHILE YOU GET TO SCRUB IN.
WELL, I'M NOT SCRUBBING IN.

34:42.533 --> 34:44.433
I'M STITCHING UP PATIENTS
IN THE PIT.

34:44.467 --> 34:46.733
HUH. WHO DID YOU PISS OFF
TO GET THAT?

34:46.767 --> 34:48.567
I HAPPEN TO BE PULLING
GAPING PIECES OF FLESH

34:48.600 --> 34:51.200
BACK TOGETHER.
MM-HMM. YOU'RE STITCHING.

34:51.233 --> 34:53.133
YOU'RE JUST ONE STEP CLOSER

34:53.167 --> 34:55.433
TO KNITTING YOUR GRANDMA
A SWEATER.
WELL, AT LEAST MINE'S MEDICAL.

34:55.467 --> 34:57.133
WELL, YOU'RE KNITTING.

34:57.167 --> 34:59.100
I PULL PYLONS OFF PEOPLE.

35:00.467 --> 35:02.233
(Sydney) ORANGE JUICE?
ORANGE JUICE?

35:02.267 --> 35:03.767
ORANGE JUICE?

35:03.800 --> 35:05.600
OH, SWEETIE.

35:05.633 --> 35:07.567
YEAH, H-HIS COLOR'S
NOT GOOD.

35:07.600 --> 35:09.500
DO YOU WANT
SOME ORANGE JUICE?

35:09.533 --> 35:11.433
MAYBE I HAVE
SOME WHEAT CRACKERS,

35:11.467 --> 35:15.433
SOMETHING TO PUT
IN YOUR BELLY? NO.

35:15.467 --> 35:17.400
EVERYBODY, IF YOU'RE--
IF YOU'RE WAITING TO HEAR

35:17.433 --> 35:20.333
ABOUT YOUR FAMILIES,

35:20.367 --> 35:22.833
WE SHOULD BE HEARING SOMETHING
VERY SOON.

35:22.867 --> 35:24.367
I'M SORRY.

35:24.400 --> 35:27.767
HANG IN THERE, BUDDY.
JUST HANG IN THERE, BUDDY.

35:27.800 --> 35:29.133
COME ON. HOLD ON.

35:29.167 --> 35:31.067
HE MUST HAVE SAVED
AT LEAST A DOZEN PEOPLE

35:31.100 --> 35:33.400
WHO WERE STUCK UNDER CARS.
WE TOLD HIM NOT TO GO BACK.

35:33.433 --> 35:35.067
THAT'S THE KINDA GUY
HE IS.

35:35.067 --> 35:37.500
HE'S THE GUY THAT GOES BACK.

35:37.533 --> 35:39.433
HE'S GOT KIDS, TOO,
FIVE OF 'EM.

35:39.467 --> 35:41.367
OKAY, I'M COMMITTED
TO THE PROJECT.

35:41.400 --> 35:44.167
I DON'T NEED TO HEAR
ABOUT THE KIDS.

35:44.200 --> 35:46.067
LEAVE THE GIRL ALONE,
VINCE.

35:46.100 --> 35:49.067
SORRY. YOU'RE DOING
A REAL GREAT JOB THERE, DOC.

35:49.067 --> 35:51.700
HEY, HOW'S HE DOING?

35:51.733 --> 35:53.700
(Vince)
HE'S DOING ALL RIGHT.
NO, NO, HE'S NOT.

35:53.733 --> 35:55.067
I CAN'T DO ANYTHING MORE

35:55.100 --> 35:56.667
UNTIL WE GET HIM
OUT FROM UNDER THIS CAR.

35:56.700 --> 35:59.500
CAN YOU PLEASE TELL ME WHY
YOU'VE COME BACK BY YOURSELF?
SEARCH AND RESCUE--

35:59.533 --> 36:01.667
THEY'RE BURIED. THEY SAID
THEY'D COME WHEN THEY CAN.

36:01.700 --> 36:04.633
DID YOU SHOW THEM THE RED TAG?
HE'S A RED TAG?

36:04.667 --> 36:07.133
THEY SAID
THEY GOT 15 RED TAGS.

36:07.167 --> 36:08.467
(Rick pants)

36:08.500 --> 36:10.167
(slurring speech)
COME ON, GUYS.

36:10.200 --> 36:12.133
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.
I'LL BE FINE.

36:12.167 --> 36:14.067
NO, NO, NO, NO.
DON'T DO THIS, MAN.

36:14.100 --> 36:16.067

36:51.200 --> 36:53.100
SO WHEN I COME BACK
TO CHECK ON YOU

36:53.133 --> 36:55.267
AFTER THE SURGERY,
YOU BETTER STILL BE ALIVE.

36:55.300 --> 36:57.600
