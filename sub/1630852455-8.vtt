01:33.760 --> 01:37.000
-What can I get you, handsome?
-Maybe just a tonic water.

01:37.960 --> 01:39.320
Tonic it is.

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
-What happened to the face?
-I think it makes me look rugged.

01:46.240 --> 01:48.720
-I had a disagreement with someone.

01:48.800 --> 01:52.000
Aww. Well, you'll get
no disagreements here, darling.

01:52.080 --> 01:55.480
-You just sit back and enjoy.
-I didn't come here to ogle the girls.

01:56.600 --> 01:57.960
Or the boys.

01:58.040 --> 01:59.600
Why did you come here, then?

02:01.080 --> 02:04.000
-My friend used to come here.

02:04.080 --> 02:07.040
You probably heard about him.
Carlton Flynn.

02:10.480 --> 02:11.480
He's missing.

02:12.200 --> 02:14.120
-Presumed dead.

02:14.200 --> 02:16.840
I'm sorry. That must be
really hard for you.

02:16.920 --> 02:20.560
This is where he spent his final evening,
so they say.

02:22.280 --> 02:23.360
All night here.

02:26.640 --> 02:29.960
-Surprised you don't know about this.

02:30.040 --> 02:33.040
I'm just serving the drinks, darling.
Just serving the drinks.

02:40.040 --> 02:44.080


02:44.160 --> 02:49.080


02:49.160 --> 02:54.800


02:54.880 --> 02:58.840


02:58.920 --> 03:02.000


03:02.080 --> 03:04.120


03:04.200 --> 03:06.240


03:06.960 --> 03:08.920


03:09.000 --> 03:10.480


03:10.560 --> 03:15.160


04:16.840 --> 04:17.800
Sir.

04:18.880 --> 04:20.880
-They found another skull.
-Jesus.

04:21.800 --> 04:23.600
-How many?

04:23.680 --> 04:25.000
They're saying as many as 15.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.480
Fifteen!

04:27.560 --> 04:29.280
The ones on top are still identifiable,

04:29.360 --> 04:31.480
but further down,
they kinda blend into each other.

04:31.560 --> 04:33.760
It'll be weeks
before we get a definite ID.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.200
Can they confirm Carlton Flynn?

04:37.360 --> 04:38.440
Doesn't look like it.

04:38.960 --> 04:42.920
He wouldn't have been in there very long,
and the remains are… older.

04:43.640 --> 04:46.120
-Doesn't mean he's not dead, though.
-How do you mean?

04:46.200 --> 04:49.760
Well, this could be the place
where the killer just puts them, you know,

04:49.840 --> 04:51.400
days, weeks, months after.

04:52.080 --> 04:53.200
We just don't know.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.840
Do you think Stewart Green's down there?

04:58.800 --> 05:00.880
Well, I'd say we're gonna find out.

05:05.400 --> 05:07.320
<i>I know what happened</i>
<i>to Stewart Green.</i>

05:08.200 --> 05:09.400
<i>I know what you did.</i>

05:11.520 --> 05:12.720
<i>Meet me at the pier.</i>

05:13.800 --> 05:15.160
<i>I'll wait for you there.</i>

05:17.520 --> 05:19.400
<i> To repeat this message,</i>
<i>press one--</i>

05:24.960 --> 05:26.640
I'm just going to the shops!

05:41.120 --> 05:42.160
Hello.

05:42.240 --> 05:45.480
<i> There's a woman in my room!</i>
<i>There's a woman. Help me!</i>

05:45.560 --> 05:47.600
-Frances, calm down.
-<i>You must come!</i>

05:47.680 --> 05:51.200
I can't! I can't deal with this right now,
but if you wait--

05:51.280 --> 05:53.640
<i>She told me I must call Cassie.</i>

05:55.880 --> 05:56.720
Who did?

05:58.320 --> 05:59.160
Who was it?

05:59.800 --> 06:01.520
-Frances!

06:01.600 --> 06:03.480
-Oh shit!

06:28.480 --> 06:29.480
Frances?

06:31.280 --> 06:32.120
Frances.

06:33.200 --> 06:34.520
Frances, are you okay?

06:37.120 --> 06:39.240
-There was a woman.
-Uh…

06:40.440 --> 06:41.400
What woman?

06:42.760 --> 06:44.520
I thought she was gonna kill me!

06:44.600 --> 06:47.040
-There's no one here now, Frances.
-She left.

06:47.560 --> 06:48.880
Did you recognize the woman?

06:50.080 --> 06:50.920
Yes.

06:54.720 --> 06:55.560
I think

06:56.080 --> 06:57.560
she looked like

06:59.160 --> 07:00.320
an angel.

07:07.920 --> 07:09.200
Frances.

07:15.120 --> 07:18.800
Do you remember a long time ago,
when we used to talk about everything?

07:20.320 --> 07:22.760
You're the closest thing to a mum
that I've got.

07:24.720 --> 07:26.800
You're the only one that's always…

07:29.120 --> 07:30.120
really known me.

07:32.200 --> 07:33.200
And I'm scared.

07:36.480 --> 07:37.560
I'm really scared.

09:01.720 --> 09:02.640
So what are you saying?

09:02.720 --> 09:05.160
<i>We're triangulating his phone,</i>
<i>but there's nothing yet.</i>

09:05.240 --> 09:08.240
<i> As soon as Ray Levine turns on</i>
<i>his phone, I want to know about it.</i>

09:09.400 --> 09:10.320
Well, hang on.

09:11.120 --> 09:12.120
Detective Broome!

09:14.760 --> 09:16.440
-You can't--
-No, don't touch me!

09:16.520 --> 09:18.000
-Hey, Leanne.
-Calm down.

09:18.080 --> 09:20.040
-Mr. Flynn, why are you here?
-I saw it online.

09:20.120 --> 09:22.560
Someone posted a photo.
So what's happening?

09:22.640 --> 09:25.760
-You shouldn't be here.
-These woods, this is where Carlton--

09:25.840 --> 09:27.720
-Mr. Flynn.
-So why didn't you tell me?

09:27.800 --> 09:29.200
I'm going out of my mind!

09:29.280 --> 09:32.280
There's nothing to tell yet.
There's no confirmation that Carlton--

09:32.360 --> 09:33.800
Don't give me that crap.

09:34.560 --> 09:36.640
-Is he there?
-All I can tell you is this.

09:36.720 --> 09:40.680
Human remains have been discovered.
There's no indication that it's Carlton.

09:40.760 --> 09:43.560
Broome! We've got a location
on Ray Levine's phone.

09:43.640 --> 09:46.600
I've gotta go.
I'll call you the minute I hear anything.

10:17.680 --> 10:19.800
<i>So sorry I can't get to the phone.</i>

10:19.880 --> 10:22.680
<i>Please leave me a message,</i>
<i>and I'll get back to you as soon as I can.</i>

10:23.680 --> 10:26.080
That woman in Vipers,
she knows something.

10:27.240 --> 10:29.360
Why are you not answering your phone?

10:46.560 --> 10:47.400
Come on.

10:48.640 --> 10:49.600
Come on, Cassie.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.040
There he is!

11:08.720 --> 11:09.880
Authority granted.

11:20.080 --> 11:23.720
Head to the beach!
Clear the area! Clear the area!

11:26.480 --> 11:27.800
Armed police!

11:29.560 --> 11:30.440
Stand still!

11:37.160 --> 11:38.000
Clear!

11:39.160 --> 11:40.960
-Move out of the way! Get back!

11:48.480 --> 11:51.320
-Stand still!
-Armed police! Stand still!

11:52.280 --> 11:53.440
Get down on your knees!

11:54.800 --> 11:58.680
Get down! Down on your knees!
Keep your hands over your head!

12:03.960 --> 12:06.800
Ray Levine, I'm arresting you
on suspicion of murder.

12:07.400 --> 12:09.720
You do not have to say anything,
but it may harm your defense

12:09.800 --> 12:13.320
if you do not mention when questioned
something you later rely on in court.

12:14.600 --> 12:15.440
Cuff him.

12:28.200 --> 12:30.160
There's been an attack on Megan Pierce.

12:30.240 --> 12:31.400
-What?
-She was stabbed.

12:31.480 --> 12:33.720
-Her attacker was killed in the scuffle.
-Killed?

12:33.800 --> 12:36.840
The dead woman fits the description
of one of Harry Sutton's killers.

12:36.920 --> 12:39.960
-Is Megan okay?
-Yeah, mainly blood loss, shock.

12:40.480 --> 12:42.880
Okay, you go to the crime scene.
Check that she was on her own.

12:42.960 --> 12:45.840
I'll follow laughing boy to the station.
What a fuckin' day.

13:09.480 --> 13:11.520
-Uh<i>…</i> ward 22?
-Down there on the left.

13:11.600 --> 13:12.520
Oh, thank you.

13:13.280 --> 13:15.880
<i>Please remember</i>
<i>to use the sanitizing stations</i>

13:15.960 --> 13:18.040
<i>when traveling around the hospital.</i>

13:23.640 --> 13:24.480
Excuse me, sir--

13:24.560 --> 13:25.880
-It's okay.
-She's my fiancée.

13:25.960 --> 13:26.920
-Dave.
-Oh, Megan.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.360
Thank God you're okay.

13:28.440 --> 13:30.160
-We could have lost you.
-Where are the kids?

13:30.240 --> 13:33.160
The police are looking after them.
It's okay, they're safe.

13:33.240 --> 13:35.840
This is all my fault.
All my secrets. I'm so sorry.

13:35.920 --> 13:37.880
Listen, I love you so much.

13:38.480 --> 13:39.320
I love you.

13:55.760 --> 13:56.880
These are for you.

13:56.960 --> 13:58.240
I've got a deal for you.

13:59.520 --> 14:00.360
I'm listening.

14:00.440 --> 14:02.920
My solicitor is gonna advise me

14:03.000 --> 14:05.400
to "no comment" my way
through this interview.

14:06.360 --> 14:08.760
-And I'm happy to do it.
-That's your prerogative.

14:08.840 --> 14:12.120
But<i>…</i> if you let me speak to Cassie,

14:12.200 --> 14:13.960
I'll tell you everything I know.

14:14.040 --> 14:16.200
Can't be done. Totally unheard of.

14:16.280 --> 14:20.000
You're under arrest for multiple murders.
We set the rules.

14:20.960 --> 14:22.040
-Fine.
-Fine.

14:23.920 --> 14:25.400
In that case, no comment.

14:33.400 --> 14:36.120
She's been attacked, Ray.
She's in hospital.

14:36.720 --> 14:37.560
Is she okay?

14:37.640 --> 14:39.240
She could have been killed.

14:40.120 --> 14:41.440
Very nearly was.

14:43.400 --> 14:45.200
Just give me ten minutes with her,

14:45.880 --> 14:49.520
and then you can ask me anything you want,
and I'll tell you the truth.

14:51.400 --> 14:52.240
Please.

14:55.120 --> 14:56.040
Was it hard?

14:56.880 --> 14:58.200
Lying all those years?

15:00.000 --> 15:00.880
It got easier.

15:02.680 --> 15:04.680
The truth wasn't really an option.

15:06.360 --> 15:09.920
And the further you get from it,
the less sense it makes to tell anyone.

15:12.400 --> 15:13.280
I knew, Meg.

15:14.720 --> 15:16.160
Not about the lies, but…

15:18.360 --> 15:21.640
It always felt like there was
something holding you back. Something…

15:24.360 --> 15:26.160
I'm so sorry, Dave.

15:27.280 --> 15:29.480
I never meant to put our family in danger.

15:30.600 --> 15:31.960
The truth is out now,

15:32.880 --> 15:35.800
and we can<i>…</i> move forward.

15:37.560 --> 15:38.520
Yeah.

15:41.880 --> 15:43.040
I'm sorry to disturb you.

15:44.560 --> 15:48.280
There have been developments.
If you're well enough, I need your help.

16:24.640 --> 16:26.560
We'll be outside the whole time.

16:43.360 --> 16:45.720
We tracked the car
of the partner of Megan's attacker.

16:45.800 --> 16:49.240
There's ANPR hits here, heading
towards the coast. Last one was here.

16:49.320 --> 16:50.760
Shit. That's Vipers. When?

16:51.400 --> 16:52.240
Two hours ago.

16:53.640 --> 16:54.480
Shit.

16:55.360 --> 16:58.440
You stay here with Ray Levine.
He gets ten minutes with Megan.

16:59.000 --> 16:59.840
Shit.

16:59.920 --> 17:02.720
<i>Keep it short.</i>
<i>No one wants to hear your podcast.</i>

17:15.560 --> 17:16.880
Are you all right? What happened?

17:18.080 --> 17:19.520
I'm fine.

17:21.960 --> 17:23.640
We're not here to talk about me.

17:25.080 --> 17:26.200
What do you want, Ray?

17:28.440 --> 17:30.840
I just wanted to speak to you.

17:32.160 --> 17:33.000
Okay.

17:35.080 --> 17:35.920
So…

17:37.960 --> 17:38.800
speak.

17:50.160 --> 17:52.080
Did you kill all those men, Ray?

17:55.040 --> 17:55.880
No.

17:59.160 --> 18:00.360
I loved you, Cass.

18:01.880 --> 18:03.800
-I loved you more than--
-I know.

18:06.240 --> 18:08.160
I've never felt that way before.

18:10.080 --> 18:12.200
Or since. But after you left--

18:12.280 --> 18:15.560
I just need you to tell me the truth, Ray.

18:19.080 --> 18:19.960
I will.

18:24.240 --> 18:26.720
But first, I need you
to tell <i>me </i>the truth.

18:28.160 --> 18:29.000
About what?

18:31.000 --> 18:32.520
You killed Stewart Green.

18:37.240 --> 18:38.080
<i>Hello?</i>

18:38.160 --> 18:41.320
Rudy, it's Broome. Is Lorraine there?
She's not answering her phone.

18:41.400 --> 18:42.560
<i>No, she's left.</i>

18:42.640 --> 18:45.600
Do us a favor. Go into the club,
see if there's a young, tall guy in there.

18:45.680 --> 18:47.560
He's got dark hair.
He's a bit preppy looking.

18:47.640 --> 18:49.640
-<i> Wait, what is--</i>
-Just… just fuckin' do it.

18:49.720 --> 18:52.760
<i> He was here earlier, or someone</i>
<i>like that was, sitting at the bar.</i>

18:52.840 --> 18:54.080
When did he leave?

18:54.160 --> 18:57.240
-<i> Not sure. About an hour ago.</i>
When did Lorraine leave?

18:57.320 --> 18:58.320
<i> Just after.</i>

18:59.080 --> 19:00.160
Fuck.

19:00.240 --> 19:02.920
-Why the hell would you say that?
Because…

19:06.720 --> 19:10.560
I came across his<i>…</i> body in the woods.

19:12.240 --> 19:13.120
He was dead.

19:15.480 --> 19:16.600
I saw you.

19:17.760 --> 19:19.080
I saw you run away.

19:23.800 --> 19:24.800
Did you kill him?

19:25.480 --> 19:29.280
You asked me to go up there.
You left me a message.

19:30.360 --> 19:31.200
What message?

19:31.840 --> 19:33.960
You left me a message at the club.

19:37.720 --> 19:39.320
I never left you a message.

19:40.120 --> 19:45.200
-So how did you know to go up there?
-Because I waited for you like usual.

19:45.280 --> 19:47.480
I saw you leave the club,
and I followed you.

19:47.560 --> 19:50.440
<i>…</i>gear, make sure you give<i>…</i>

19:50.520 --> 19:53.200
I've taken some photographs
down south. I just need some advice.

19:53.800 --> 19:55.280
<i>I knew what had been going on.</i>

19:55.360 --> 19:59.440
Stewart<i>…</i> threatening you
and God knows what else.

19:59.520 --> 20:01.920
So if you didn't
leave me that message, who did?

20:04.480 --> 20:06.920
Stewart, trying to

20:08.240 --> 20:09.560
get you there alone.

20:09.640 --> 20:10.480
No.

20:12.160 --> 20:13.640
Because when I got up there…

20:20.080 --> 20:22.760
…he was covered in blood.

20:23.760 --> 20:24.600
Yeah, right.

20:26.760 --> 20:28.640
-He was dead.
-You'd already killed him.

20:28.720 --> 20:29.560
No.

20:30.880 --> 20:31.920
I told you.

20:33.360 --> 20:34.480
I was behind you.

20:35.200 --> 20:37.360
<i>I saw you run, and…</i>

20:37.440 --> 20:38.320
Cassie!

20:38.400 --> 20:39.800
…<i>I should have gone after you,</i>

20:39.880 --> 20:43.360
<i>but I… I just needed to see</i>
<i>what it was you were running from.</i>

20:49.800 --> 20:51.400
You thought I killed him?

20:55.360 --> 20:56.560
What did you do, Ray?

20:57.200 --> 21:00.640
I… I panicked. He was dead.
I thought you'd killed him.

21:02.280 --> 21:03.760
I had to protect you.

21:06.080 --> 21:11.240
You would have gone to prison, so I did
the only thing that I could to help.

21:13.720 --> 21:15.360
I got rid of the body.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.520
<i>I dragged him out of the woods.</i>

21:22.200 --> 21:23.720
<i>I got him into the car,</i>

21:24.880 --> 21:27.680
<i>and I drove somewhere remote.</i>

21:32.400 --> 21:35.320
And then I got myself an ax.

21:43.520 --> 21:45.280
And I<i>…</i> chopped him up.

21:51.360 --> 21:52.600
It was like a trance.

21:54.160 --> 21:55.000
I somehow

21:56.600 --> 21:58.560
managed to turn off my mind, and<i>…</i>

22:00.200 --> 22:01.160
<i>And…</i>

22:03.160 --> 22:06.240
<i>I put the pieces into plastic bags.</i>

22:11.040 --> 22:12.960
<i>I weighed them down with stones…</i>

22:15.680 --> 22:19.480
…<i>and I threw them</i>
<i>where they would never be found.</i>

22:22.520 --> 22:24.480
<i> Hi, it's Cassie.</i>
<i>If you can't reach me,</i>

22:24.560 --> 22:27.360
<i>it's because I'm too busy having fun.</i>
<i>Leave a message!</i>

22:28.240 --> 22:31.360
<i>Hi, it's Cassie. If you can't reach me,</i>
<i>it's because I'm too busy--</i>

22:31.440 --> 22:32.320
<i>Hi, it's Cassie--</i>

22:32.400 --> 22:34.040
<i>It's Cassie--</i>

22:35.600 --> 22:38.480
Fuck me. What the fuck? Ray?

22:38.560 --> 22:40.120
Uh, Ray, what happened?

22:41.080 --> 22:42.120
I can't remember.

22:44.360 --> 22:46.680
And then I<i>…</i> came to find you,

22:47.640 --> 22:51.240
to see if you were okay,
but you weren't there,

22:51.320 --> 22:54.120
and you weren't picking up your phone and…

22:55.960 --> 23:00.360
The<i>…</i> the days turned into<i>…</i> to weeks,

23:00.440 --> 23:03.520
and still you didn't reappear.

23:04.840 --> 23:06.440
And I was left with this…

23:08.880 --> 23:12.880
<i>…</i>this image… image of<i>…</i>

23:13.680 --> 23:14.720
…blood and…

23:18.320 --> 23:19.840
But you<i>…</i> you'd gone,

23:21.440 --> 23:22.880
and you never came back.

23:27.440 --> 23:28.800
You never came back.

23:31.880 --> 23:33.400
I'm so sorry, Ray.

23:48.280 --> 23:50.680
Come on. Come on, come on, come on.

23:58.760 --> 24:00.560
Hello?

24:01.240 --> 24:02.080
Lorraine?

24:04.920 --> 24:05.760
Lorraine?

24:09.080 --> 24:10.000
Is anyone here?

24:12.480 --> 24:13.320
Lorraine?

24:15.960 --> 24:16.800
Hello?

24:20.880 --> 24:21.800
Is anyone here?

25:40.520 --> 25:41.360
Broome.

25:43.520 --> 25:44.720
Put the weapon down.

25:48.720 --> 25:50.440
-Lorraine--
-Just put the weapon down.

25:50.520 --> 25:54.120
And if you've, uh<i>…</i> if you've called
for backup, call them off.

25:54.200 --> 25:57.000
-Lorraine, whatever's happened--
-Call off your backup.

25:57.640 --> 25:58.480
Now.

25:58.560 --> 26:00.400
Okay.

26:10.720 --> 26:12.440
This is DS Broome to Control.

26:13.640 --> 26:14.760
Cancel all units.

26:15.920 --> 26:18.120
<i>Control canceling units.</i>

26:18.200 --> 26:20.160
<i>-Status update?</i>
-All in order.

26:28.120 --> 26:29.000
What happened?

26:31.640 --> 26:34.800
He wanted information
about the whereabouts of Carlton Flynn.

26:35.680 --> 26:37.000
Carlton's dad hired him.

26:39.640 --> 26:40.880
He was gonna kill me.

26:42.440 --> 26:44.000
Just like he killed Harry.

26:46.200 --> 26:47.280
And Tawny.

26:48.600 --> 26:50.880
But it didn't work out
the way he thought it would.

26:53.880 --> 26:56.760
He could dish it out,
but he couldn't take it back.

26:59.600 --> 27:01.040
Like so many men.

27:05.240 --> 27:06.200
They deserve it.

27:06.800 --> 27:08.240
Don't you think, Broome?

27:10.280 --> 27:11.280
Men like that.

27:21.960 --> 27:23.000
Oh Jesus, no!

27:25.560 --> 27:27.400
Lorraine, no.

27:27.480 --> 27:29.000
No, no, no.

27:29.080 --> 27:30.120
One a year.

27:31.480 --> 27:32.640
At Carnival.

27:34.680 --> 27:35.600
Why?

27:36.840 --> 27:37.880
Why?

27:39.640 --> 27:40.680
For revenge.

27:42.640 --> 27:43.480
I…

27:47.000 --> 27:48.880
I don't understand. W…

27:50.880 --> 27:53.480
-We're in love.
-No, no, please. Please.

27:54.080 --> 27:55.200
Don't get sentimental.

27:55.280 --> 28:00.040
It… it doesn't change
the way I feel about you.

28:00.120 --> 28:00.960
What?

28:02.640 --> 28:06.760
There are more than a dozen dead men
lying in a hole in the ground.

28:07.680 --> 28:08.600
We found the bodies!

28:08.680 --> 28:13.720
And they were all horrible,
nasty, shithead men who hurt women.

28:13.800 --> 28:16.120
You know them. You've seen the type.

28:17.200 --> 28:18.520
So you killed them?

28:18.600 --> 28:23.320
I wanted to make sure they could never lay
another finger on a woman ever again.

28:29.400 --> 28:31.280
I need a drink.

28:31.360 --> 28:35.000
Do you want a drink? Yeah, let's get
a drink. You always liked a drink.

28:58.920 --> 29:00.760
You know I used to be married, right?

29:02.600 --> 29:05.080
-I remember you talking about it.
-Mmm.

29:07.080 --> 29:09.520
Yeah, I got hitched young.

29:10.880 --> 29:12.120
Too young.

29:13.360 --> 29:17.000
Yeah, we moved in together.
We got jobs, fucked a lot.

29:18.760 --> 29:21.600
And then one day, for no good reason,

29:23.600 --> 29:24.920
he beat the shit out of me.

29:26.680 --> 29:29.520
He apologized. You know, the usual.
"Won't happen again."

29:30.560 --> 29:33.040
But guess what? It happened again.

29:34.680 --> 29:35.840
And again.

29:38.360 --> 29:41.840
Life wasn't treating him so great,

29:41.920 --> 29:42.760
you know,

29:43.760 --> 29:46.400
so he did what all shitty little men do,

29:46.480 --> 29:49.480
and he took it out
on the one person that cared about him.

29:51.920 --> 29:53.400
So guess what happened next?

29:54.280 --> 29:56.720
Come on. I mean,
like… like the irony of life.

29:56.800 --> 30:00.360
Like life is really
taking the piss out of you.

30:01.440 --> 30:03.080
-You got pregnant.
-Bingo.

30:05.680 --> 30:09.360
And, you know, for a few months,
things did actually improve.

30:09.440 --> 30:12.240
Everything that people said was true.

30:13.240 --> 30:14.960
A baby does make things better.

30:16.760 --> 30:19.600
But then, uh<i>…</i> one night, he…

30:20.320 --> 30:22.040
he complained about his food.

30:23.160 --> 30:26.160
Said it was tasteless, hmm? Got all pissy.

30:27.360 --> 30:28.720
So I said, um…

30:29.240 --> 30:33.160
I said, "Hey, you should try
cooking yourself sometime."

30:36.200 --> 30:37.280
And that was that.

30:39.880 --> 30:42.240
He punched me to the floor.

30:44.800 --> 30:45.920
Put some kicks in…

30:48.000 --> 30:49.000
to the stomach.

30:53.680 --> 30:55.280
He ruptured my uterus.

30:58.760 --> 31:00.440
You know what that means, don't you?

31:03.080 --> 31:03.920
No kids.

31:04.880 --> 31:05.720
Ever.

31:09.120 --> 31:11.880
I am so sorry
you had to go through all that.

31:11.960 --> 31:13.240
Stop. Don't do that.

31:13.920 --> 31:14.760
Don't.

31:16.720 --> 31:17.560
Please.

31:18.880 --> 31:20.000
Put the knife down.

31:20.080 --> 31:23.440
You know, I could have had him
put away for killing our baby,

31:23.520 --> 31:25.520
but<i>…</i> we covered it.

31:27.720 --> 31:29.480
We pretended it was an accident.

31:31.440 --> 31:34.640
And then Carnival came,
and he<i>…</i> he had a few drinks.

31:35.880 --> 31:36.840
He tried it on…

31:38.960 --> 31:40.240
and I… I<i>…</i>

31:41.240 --> 31:46.520
I just wasn't ready, you know?
I… I couldn't stand his hands on me.

31:47.880 --> 31:49.520
So I told him no,

31:49.600 --> 31:52.320
and… and he got angry, and…

31:53.440 --> 31:56.120
<i>…</i>he tried to, um, force himself on me.

31:59.080 --> 32:00.320
So I killed him.

32:02.520 --> 32:03.440
Just like that.

32:06.760 --> 32:07.640
I got a knife,

32:09.120 --> 32:10.440
and I stuck it in him.

32:14.440 --> 32:16.480
It was the best thing I ever did.

32:17.920 --> 32:19.800
He had taken my child's life.

32:21.280 --> 32:22.400
I had taken his.

32:23.680 --> 32:24.920
And no one found out?

32:25.520 --> 32:26.360
No.

32:26.920 --> 32:29.720
No, I just told people he'd left me,
you know, done a runner.

32:30.240 --> 32:35.000
Missing people aren't dead people.
And scummy men go missing all the time.

32:38.280 --> 32:40.000
About a year later, I moved too.

32:40.080 --> 32:42.080
I came here, got a job at Vipers.

32:43.720 --> 32:49.120
And it was there that I realized
that there are way too many men

32:50.080 --> 32:52.080
treating women like he treated me.

32:54.760 --> 32:56.800
And they are just getting away with it.

32:59.680 --> 33:02.920
<i>And Vipers was</i>
<i>the perfect place for men to try it on.</i>

33:03.440 --> 33:04.600
-Come on--
-Piss off.

33:04.680 --> 33:05.920
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

33:06.520 --> 33:07.560
Fuck off!

33:09.680 --> 33:11.560
<i> So I used to tell them</i>

33:11.640 --> 33:15.200
<i>that I'd arranged for them</i>
<i>to meet a girl in the woods.</i>

33:15.280 --> 33:16.560
<i>They always fell for it.</i>

33:23.960 --> 33:26.560
<i>And then I'd dump their bodies</i>
<i>in the bunker.</i>

33:33.240 --> 33:35.040
<i>You're gonna laugh</i>
<i>at this, but, uh,</i>

33:36.520 --> 33:40.480
I used to think of myself
as an avenging angel.

33:42.400 --> 33:43.760
And I can sleep at night.

33:43.840 --> 33:47.720
You know, I'm not<i>…</i> I'm not preying
on the vulnerable or the weak.

33:49.400 --> 33:50.880
You killed Stewart Green.

33:52.320 --> 33:53.400
To help Cassie.

33:55.080 --> 33:56.920
I, uh<i>…</i> I got him to the woods.

33:57.000 --> 34:00.240
I said that Cassie had left him a message
to meet her there.

34:03.160 --> 34:05.880
-What are you doing here?
-It's a surprise.

34:06.720 --> 34:08.080
From me and Cassie.

34:10.080 --> 34:12.000
Please! No! Stop!

34:13.640 --> 34:15.360
No! Stop!

34:22.840 --> 34:26.840
<i>And then I left a note</i>
<i>for Cassie, telling her to meet Ray there.</i>

34:29.200 --> 34:32.080
I wanted her to see
that she was free of Stewart.

34:33.160 --> 34:34.400
But when I went back,

34:36.200 --> 34:37.280
the body was gone.

34:38.880 --> 34:40.360
And pretty soon, so was Cassie.

34:41.200 --> 34:45.400
But<i>… </i>why bring it all back up?

34:46.680 --> 34:50.760
Why go to Cassie
and tell her that Stewart was still alive?

34:50.840 --> 34:53.160
She came back one night to Vipers

34:54.280 --> 34:55.760
in this disguise.

34:57.480 --> 35:00.040
I couldn't believe it
when I saw her on the CCTV.

35:00.640 --> 35:04.640
<i>I just wanted to know what had happened.</i>
<i>You know, why she'd left.</i>

35:04.720 --> 35:06.920
What she had done with Stewart's body.

35:07.000 --> 35:10.160
I had to talk to her.
I just had to find out.

35:12.400 --> 35:13.960
And it brought me back to you.

35:19.120 --> 35:20.000
I'm sorry.

35:26.400 --> 35:27.400
I love you.

35:29.480 --> 35:30.960
I thought that, um<i>…</i>

35:32.400 --> 35:35.280
<i>…</i>you know, we could, um…

35:35.360 --> 35:37.920
-With the time you have left<i>…</i>
-I know.

35:39.800 --> 35:41.440
I would have liked that.

35:42.720 --> 35:44.840
Why did you have to do this?

35:44.920 --> 35:46.640
I'm so sorry.

35:50.000 --> 35:52.320
I'm dying, Broome!

35:54.920 --> 35:58.280
I don't want to spend
my last days in prison!

36:00.840 --> 36:02.440
-Lorraine…
-I love you!

36:02.520 --> 36:04.560
I love you so much!

36:04.640 --> 36:05.800
Lorraine, please.

36:05.880 --> 36:07.800
-No, Lorraine.
-I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry!

36:07.880 --> 36:10.280
-Please, Lorraine. Please.

36:10.360 --> 36:12.360
No! No!

36:20.400 --> 36:22.760
I'll be with you, okay?

36:26.000 --> 36:27.440
I'll stay close.

36:43.640 --> 36:44.960
Lorraine Griggs…

36:47.520 --> 36:49.720
I am arresting you on suspicion of murder.

36:51.280 --> 36:53.200
You do not have to say anything…

36:56.240 --> 36:58.280
…but it may harm your defense

36:58.960 --> 37:03.080
if you do not mention when questioned
something which you…

37:05.320 --> 37:07.440
you later rely on in court.

38:27.480 --> 38:30.000
<i>I set up Ray Levine.</i>
<i>I stole his camera</i>

38:30.080 --> 38:34.040
with his photos of Carlton Flynn,
in case there were any photos of me.

38:35.280 --> 38:39.080
<i>Carlton had set up a tab at the club,</i>
<i>so I planted his credit card in Ray's car.</i>

38:40.960 --> 38:43.400
So you did murder Carlton Flynn?

38:44.640 --> 38:45.720
Yes.

38:57.680 --> 38:59.800
<i> And sometimes</i>
<i>I set up other men</i>

39:00.320 --> 39:03.840
<i>just to keep them away from women</i>
<i>and take the heat off me.</i>

39:03.920 --> 39:08.440


39:08.520 --> 39:10.680
<i>We've been unable</i>
<i>to locate the body.</i>

39:11.840 --> 39:12.920
Carlton's.

39:13.000 --> 39:15.600
Can you tell us
why it isn't with the others?

39:15.680 --> 39:17.560
<i>No, I can't explain that.</i>

39:17.640 --> 39:19.440
<i>Where did you leave the body?</i>

39:19.960 --> 39:21.560
<i>With the others.</i>

39:21.640 --> 39:25.360
<i>Maybe it got washed away</i>
<i>or an animal carried it off.</i>

39:26.200 --> 39:31.440
-I don't know.

40:27.760 --> 40:29.600
-Right.
-Good luck, man.

40:30.320 --> 40:31.320
Yeah, thanks.

40:32.400 --> 40:33.360
New start, eh?

40:34.600 --> 40:37.200
See if I can rediscover
some of my old skills out there.

40:44.480 --> 40:45.360
I'll miss you, man.

40:46.360 --> 40:47.480
Yeah, me too.

40:53.680 --> 40:55.600
All right, piss off
before I start blubbing.

40:55.680 --> 40:57.400
-Aah!
-Don't trash the place.

41:11.360 --> 41:14.560
Excuse me.
Can we just make a quick stop on the way?

41:33.080 --> 41:37.360
Well, 17 years,
three kids, a few gray hairs later…

41:38.360 --> 41:40.600
…we are finally husband and wife.

41:45.560 --> 41:46.880
So, to my soulmate,

41:48.680 --> 41:49.920
my best friend,

41:50.800 --> 41:53.280
the mother of my amazing little monsters…

41:55.000 --> 41:58.040
Please, raise a glass

41:58.800 --> 41:59.640
to Megan.

41:59.720 --> 42:01.320
To Megan!

42:34.160 --> 42:35.520
Mrs. Shaw, I presume?

42:36.200 --> 42:38.120
-The very same.

42:40.040 --> 42:42.720
-I loved your speech.
-I meant every word.

42:44.560 --> 42:47.640
You're okay, right?
You can accept it, my past?

42:47.720 --> 42:50.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's not, um…

42:52.080 --> 42:53.200
Aah…

42:53.800 --> 42:54.760
It's me.

42:56.360 --> 42:58.320
There's something <i>I</i> need to tell <i>you</i>.

42:59.160 --> 43:02.640
Okay, so I did something, for Kayleigh.
It's not a big deal.

43:02.720 --> 43:07.000
But we… had this father-daughter thing,
like a pact.

43:07.080 --> 43:08.080
Um…

43:08.600 --> 43:11.720
So if she was ever in trouble
or she needed a ride home,

43:11.800 --> 43:14.400
and she calls me,
I go, no questions asked, all right?

43:14.480 --> 43:18.360
So, uh… one night,
a few months ago, you were sleeping.

43:18.440 --> 43:20.720
She calls, asking me
to pick up her and Bea.

43:20.800 --> 43:22.880
<i>Um, so I drive out, middle of nowhere.</i>

43:23.560 --> 43:24.640
Get in.

43:27.880 --> 43:31.400
<i>And then as we're driving off, I see</i>
<i>this other car discarded by the bushes.</i>

43:31.480 --> 43:34.960
<i>A few days later,</i>
<i>I saw something about the car on the news.</i>

43:35.920 --> 43:39.240
<i>I didn't want her getting mixed up</i>
<i>in anything, so I went back</i>,

43:39.320 --> 43:40.800
<i>and the car was still there.</i>

43:44.160 --> 43:45.600
No one's gonna find it now.

43:47.040 --> 43:48.360
I was protecting Kayleigh,

43:49.280 --> 43:51.520
but nothing's come of it.

43:51.600 --> 43:54.760
And seriously, I don't think
there's anything to worry about.

43:54.840 --> 43:56.200
It's gone. It's done with.

43:59.600 --> 44:02.560
And that is it.
There's definitely no more secrets.

44:03.680 --> 44:06.720
-Oh no, you don't. No skulking out here.

44:06.800 --> 44:08.800
-You lot are the stars of the show.

44:08.880 --> 44:11.160
It's Darren's DJ set in a minute. Come on.

44:11.240 --> 44:13.600
-I just… I need just two minutes.
-Okay.

44:28.160 --> 44:30.640
-Wait for me!

44:39.280 --> 44:40.760
<i>He was chasing us, Mum.</i>

44:41.440 --> 44:44.240
We were so scared. You have to believe me.

44:44.320 --> 44:46.160
Of course I believe you.

44:47.440 --> 44:49.360
You can tell me anything.

44:49.440 --> 44:50.960
I'm here for you.

44:57.720 --> 45:01.000
He was chasing us
through these woods near Vipers.

45:19.680 --> 45:21.640
When I fucking find you…

45:45.840 --> 45:47.680
-Bitch! You spiked me!

45:55.640 --> 45:57.120
-Why'd you run away from me?

45:57.200 --> 45:58.240
I was so scared out there!

45:58.320 --> 46:00.040
-I'm sorry, but--
-No, I don't wanna hear it!

46:00.120 --> 46:03.280
My mum's going apeshit that I'm not home.
We've gotta get out of here.

46:03.360 --> 46:07.120
Give me the keys.
Give me his fucking car keys, Kay!

46:11.800 --> 46:14.000
Mum, it all happened so fast.

46:14.760 --> 46:17.880
I wanted to tell Bea,
but I just… couldn't.

46:17.960 --> 46:22.000
<i>We took the back roads. She was scared</i>
<i>the car would be reported stolen. Then…</i>

46:22.080 --> 46:23.880
-Fuck.
-What is it?

46:23.960 --> 46:25.240
He's out of petrol.

46:25.320 --> 46:27.760
-No, we can't be!

46:27.840 --> 46:29.960
<i>So we pushed</i>
<i>the car off the road.</i>

46:30.040 --> 46:32.240
<i>I knew he'd get out</i>
<i>when he came round from the drugs.</i>

46:32.320 --> 46:34.120
As soon as I saw that he was missing,

46:34.200 --> 46:36.440
I went back to check,
and the car was gone.

46:50.360 --> 46:53.880
No! No! Help me! Help! Help me!
