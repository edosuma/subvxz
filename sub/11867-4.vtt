CARTER: Previously on Eureka.

00:02.753 --> 00:03.742
ABBY: Jack?

00:03.795 --> 00:05.501
Abby? What are
you doing here?

00:07.090 --> 00:08.250
Zoe?

00:09.301 --> 00:10.461
That's my mom.

00:13.263 --> 00:15.424
| asked you to wait.
Has she spoken to you?

00:15.474 --> 00:16.964
What?
You told her?

00:17.017 --> 00:18.177
ABBY: No, Jack, I didn't.
This is so like you!

00:18.268 --> 00:19.599
You know what?
I don't want to look
like the bad guy

00:19.645 --> 00:21.601
just because you want
to come here
and take away my kid!

00:21.647 --> 00:22.762
What are you
talking about?

00:22.814 --> 00:24.896
Your mom and I had
an agreement when
you came to live here.

00:24.942 --> 00:25.977
What?
It was a year,

00:26.068 --> 00:27.899
and then you were supposed
to come back to LA with me.

00:27.945 --> 00:30.436
You've already
ruined your own lives.
Just leave mine alone.

00:30.489 --> 00:31.820
Were you seeing Kim?

00:31.907 --> 00:35.399
More during the months
leading up to her...
To the accident.

00:39.957 --> 00:42.118
HENRY: So,
you never visited her lab?

00:42.167 --> 00:43.247
No.

01:01.144 --> 01:02.884
Hey, what's up?

01:02.938 --> 01:04.678
Noise complaint
from the neighbors.

01:06.400 --> 01:07.856
What neighbors?

01:07.943 --> 01:09.683
The ones three miles
down the road.

01:09.778 --> 01:12.520
Exactly what kind of noise
are they complaining
about three miles down...

01:12.614 --> 01:13.990
(LOUD EXPLOSION)

01:14.074 --> 01:15.063
Whoa!

01:16.451 --> 01:17.531
Never mind.

01:17.619 --> 01:18.825
Yeah.

01:31.133 --> 01:32.543
CARTER: Hello?

01:34.261 --> 01:36.217
Hi! Excuse me, sir?

01:44.104 --> 01:45.093
Yes?

01:45.188 --> 01:47.770
Hi, I'm Sheriff Jack Carter,
and you are?

01:47.858 --> 01:48.973
Busy.

01:49.067 --> 01:50.273
What is it that you need?

01:50.319 --> 01:52.935
Listen, Dr. Babajanian,
we've had a noise complaint,

01:53.030 --> 01:55.021
and we're gonna have to
ask you to keep it down.

01:55.115 --> 01:57.948
But I'm working on
simultaneously configuring

01:58.035 --> 02:00.617
the position and momentum
of electrons,

02:00.704 --> 02:02.865
so they'll no longer
be conjugate variables.

02:02.956 --> 02:06.619
Thereby debunking Heisenberg's
uncertainty principle.

02:06.710 --> 02:08.701
And as exciting
as that may be,

02:08.795 --> 02:11.286
we're still gonna have
to ask you to keep it down.

02:11.381 --> 02:12.882
Fine.

02:12.924 --> 02:14.630
Looks like you
have an oil leak.

02:15.719 --> 02:20.088
That ununseptium,
a highly volatile halogen,

02:20.140 --> 02:23.223
whose effects on human skin
have yet to be tested.

02:23.268 --> 02:24.257
Right.

02:24.353 --> 02:25.934
So, not an oil leak.

02:26.021 --> 02:27.010
Carter!

02:27.064 --> 02:28.179
(GROANS)

02:28.231 --> 02:29.687
I told you to
watch your head.

02:29.775 --> 02:31.015
No, you didn't.

02:31.943 --> 02:34.070
Okay, you know you
need special permission

02:34.112 --> 02:37.354
to use transuranic elements
outside of Global, right?

02:37.407 --> 02:38.442
Of course.

02:38.533 --> 02:40.524
So, let me see
your permits, Doctor.

02:40.577 --> 02:43.284
I'm sure they're
on file, Deputy.

02:43.372 --> 02:47.115
While we go check that out,
we're gonna have to ask you
to still keep it down.

02:49.127 --> 02:50.628
Thanks for your time.

02:53.715 --> 02:55.876
Henry, are you
sure about this?
Allison...

02:55.926 --> 02:58.793
I can set you up
in a brand new lab
with twice the space.

02:58.887 --> 03:00.718
Kim's lab will
do just fine.

03:00.764 --> 03:03.380
Okay, then at least let
me have someone clear out
all the old stuff.

03:03.475 --> 03:06.262
No, you said you would
leave it the same way
it was the day that she...

03:06.353 --> 03:08.264
Well, at least until
I had time to go
through it.

03:08.313 --> 03:10.599
I did and l have.
lt'sjust...

03:11.942 --> 03:13.273
This has to be
hard for you.

03:13.276 --> 03:16.939
| see it as a chance
to stay close to her, to
continue her work, you know?

03:16.947 --> 03:20.155
We used to finish
each other's sentences,
so...

03:21.201 --> 03:22.281
Okay.

04:23.305 --> 04:26.047
SARAH: So, Abby,
you're heading back
to Los Ange/es?

04:26.141 --> 04:27.176
Yep, this is it.

04:27.267 --> 04:28.803
I'm sorry to see you go.

04:28.852 --> 04:30.513
Oh, no, you're not.

04:30.604 --> 04:32.469
Sheriff Carter and
Zoe will miss you.

04:32.564 --> 04:34.270
No, they won't.

04:34.316 --> 04:36.602
Perhaps if you weren’t
taking Zoe away...

04:36.651 --> 04:39.142
SARAH, forgive me
if I don't feel the need

04:39.196 --> 04:43.109
to justify my parental
choices to a talking bunker.

04:44.034 --> 04:45.865
Fine. Don't let the door
hit you on the way...

04:45.952 --> 04:46.941
You want a piece of me?

04:46.995 --> 04:48.030
(CLEARS THROAT)

04:48.121 --> 04:50.658
Are you threatening
the house?

04:50.707 --> 04:52.413
She started it.

04:52.501 --> 04:53.661
Yeah.

04:54.294 --> 04:55.329
Are you okay?

04:55.378 --> 04:57.664
Yeah, I got a headache.
Where's Zoe?

04:57.756 --> 04:59.292
She's in her room.
She's okay.

04:59.341 --> 05:02.583
She's using a virtual
therapy device that
Beverly gave her.

05:02.636 --> 05:04.968
It's called an ATS.

05:05.013 --> 05:07.550
I'll tell you,
the things this
town comes up with...

05:07.599 --> 05:09.931
Oh, yeah,
it's a great
place to live.

05:09.976 --> 05:12.433
I mean, it's sort of full
of mind-blowing opportunities

05:12.562 --> 05:14.769
and brilliant minds
at the top of their game.

05:14.815 --> 05:16.931
And the schools, amazing!

05:17.734 --> 05:18.894
Jack?

05:19.986 --> 05:21.237
Yeah?

05:22.072 --> 05:23.653
Are you really
okay with this?

05:25.075 --> 05:26.565
We had an agreement.

05:26.618 --> 05:27.903
I know.

05:27.953 --> 05:30.114
But I just don't want
you to do that thing
that you do,

05:30.247 --> 05:32.158
you know, when you say
you're okay with something

05:32.249 --> 05:33.614
and then six months
after that,

05:33.750 --> 05:35.786
we're at my parents'
50th wedding anniversary

05:35.919 --> 05:37.910
and you've had
one beer too many,

05:37.963 --> 05:41.956
and you ask my mom if
the ball-buster gene comes
from her side of the family?

05:42.008 --> 05:44.124
You threw out
my baseball cards.

05:44.261 --> 05:46.468
We were having a baby.
We needed the room.

05:47.472 --> 05:51.806
I had a 1989 Upper Deck
Ken Griffey, Jr. rookie card.

05:51.893 --> 05:53.724
Do you have any idea
how much that's worth now?

05:53.770 --> 05:56.056
No, and dear God,
before you tell me,

05:56.106 --> 05:59.223
let's just try and swing
this right around
to my original point.

06:00.318 --> 06:02.775
Are you okay with me
taking Zoe back to LA?

06:04.948 --> 06:06.438
Yeah.

06:06.533 --> 06:07.773
I'm okay.

06:07.826 --> 06:09.066
Okay.

06:09.744 --> 06:11.154
'Cause the end of the
semester's coming up,

06:11.246 --> 06:13.328
and I'm gonna be coming
back to get her.

06:14.583 --> 06:16.164
So, I'll call you.

06:36.771 --> 06:37.931
Zoe!

06:39.107 --> 06:42.349
How many times have
I asked you not to leave
your stuff lying around?

06:43.028 --> 06:44.017
Huh?

06:45.363 --> 06:46.523
Zoe?

06:51.077 --> 06:52.283
Zoe?

06:57.834 --> 07:00.325
Hey, I'm talking
to you here.

07:00.420 --> 07:02.456
Hey, I'm getting
my head shrunk here.

07:02.547 --> 07:05.630
Yeah, well, shrink it after
you're done cleaning up
your mess, okay?

07:05.967 --> 07:06.956
(SIGHS)

07:08.720 --> 07:11.928
Is that the IRS thing
from Beverly?

07:12.015 --> 07:13.050
ATS.

07:13.516 --> 07:14.926
She's out of town

07:15.018 --> 07:19.102
and she thinks it'll help me
confront my inner fears
and resolve my anger issues.

07:19.898 --> 07:21.013
How's it working?

07:21.107 --> 07:23.098
Well, I'm still
pretty pissed, so...

07:24.611 --> 07:26.226
Do you wanna talk?

07:26.279 --> 07:28.770
No, actually.
I want you to
leave me alone.

07:30.116 --> 07:31.105
Hmm.

07:31.701 --> 07:34.738
Okay, that's the exact
opposite of leaving
me alone.

07:41.252 --> 07:42.708
I know you're upset.

07:43.880 --> 07:45.620
But your mom really
misses you.

07:45.715 --> 07:48.127
We agreed to
shared custody.

07:49.636 --> 07:53.094
And I think that if you
don't give this a shot,

07:53.848 --> 07:55.099
you will regret it.

07:55.183 --> 07:56.514
Custody.

07:56.559 --> 08:00.097
Meaning ownership.
Meaning l have no say.

08:00.188 --> 08:02.520
Zoe, your mom
loves you a lot.

08:03.817 --> 08:05.933
Well, you know,
I got to give her credit.

08:06.778 --> 08:08.769
At least she's willing
to fight for me.

08:09.781 --> 08:10.941
Zoe.

08:14.285 --> 08:15.274
Zoe...

08:15.370 --> 08:16.951
I'm gonna go
clean up my stuff.

08:32.595 --> 08:35.086
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
What are you doing?

08:35.932 --> 08:38.594
Rearranging furniture.
What are you doing here?

08:38.643 --> 08:41.430
Well, I said I was taking
the afternoon off,
not quitting.

08:41.813 --> 08:42.928
Okay.

08:42.939 --> 08:45.646
Okay, so everything
back in its place. Go.

08:46.317 --> 08:48.649
Sure, why should I get
to be by the window?

08:50.780 --> 08:54.113
Hey, did you pull those
permits I asked you to?

08:54.117 --> 08:55.277
What?

08:56.036 --> 08:58.994
The permits for
Babajanian's contraption?

08:59.122 --> 09:00.953
What are you
talking about?

09:01.124 --> 09:02.330
I swear, sometimes

09:04.002 --> 09:05.458
I wonder if you
even listen to me.

09:05.503 --> 09:07.334
| feel like I'm
talking to myself.

09:10.508 --> 09:11.793
Jo?

09:14.971 --> 09:16.177
Jo?

09:21.478 --> 09:23.264
Hey, Sheriff.
What can I get for you?

09:23.313 --> 09:25.520
Nothing right now.
Have you seen Jo?

09:25.940 --> 09:27.316
Who?

09:27.358 --> 09:28.859
My deputy.

09:28.943 --> 09:31.275
Oh, you got a new deputy?
That's great.

09:31.321 --> 09:33.858
I didn't get a new deputy.
l have a deputy.

09:33.948 --> 09:35.404
Deputy Jo Lupo.

09:36.326 --> 09:37.782
Oh!
Yeah.

09:38.119 --> 09:39.450
(WHISPERS) Is he cute?

09:39.996 --> 09:41.156
Okay, now you're
just bugging me.

09:41.247 --> 09:42.828
I really need
to talk to her.

09:42.874 --> 09:44.705
Listen,
maybe I could help.

09:44.793 --> 09:49.833
Has anybody here ever heard
of a, uh, Deputy Lupo?

09:51.382 --> 09:53.293
WOMAN: Who?
MAN: Not me.

09:53.384 --> 09:57.218
Sorry, Sheriff. I don't
think anybody here has
ever heard of her.

10:37.387 --> 10:38.593
Henry?

10:38.638 --> 10:39.753
HENRY: Jack.

10:40.640 --> 10:43.006
Oh, there you are.

10:43.768 --> 10:44.803
Here I am.

10:44.978 --> 10:47.185
I thought you'd be
at Global today.

10:48.940 --> 10:50.100
No.

10:50.150 --> 10:51.310
Huh!

10:54.487 --> 10:55.522
Jack, you need
something?

10:55.613 --> 10:57.820
Do you know a woman
named Jo Lupo?

10:58.449 --> 10:59.609
No, don't think so.

11:00.368 --> 11:02.950
Okay, this is really
gonna sound strange.

11:03.079 --> 11:05.286
l have a deputy
named Jo Lupo.

11:05.415 --> 11:06.404
(CHUCKLES)

11:06.457 --> 11:08.448
Small, but surprisingly
strong, bit of a gun nut?

11:08.585 --> 11:09.574
No.

11:09.627 --> 11:11.128
All right, I was having
a conversation with her today,

11:11.171 --> 11:14.038
I turn my back for
two seconds, and she's gone.

11:14.090 --> 11:16.797
Like, vanished,
and no one in the town
even remembers her.

11:18.595 --> 11:19.755
Okay.

11:19.888 --> 11:21.424
(CLEARS THROAT)

11:21.472 --> 11:23.724
I think everyone
is playing a trick
on me, right?

11:23.766 --> 11:25.597
So I go to her
house,and,

11:25.685 --> 11:28.142
you know, the name
on the mailbox is changed,

11:28.229 --> 11:30.720
and there's a family with,
like, 12 kids living there,

11:30.773 --> 11:31.979
and the house is
a different color,

11:32.066 --> 11:34.478
which is a bit far
to go for a prank.

11:35.069 --> 11:36.605
A bit, yeah.

11:39.407 --> 11:41.113
You think I'm
losing it, don't you?

11:41.242 --> 11:42.402
Um.

11:42.452 --> 11:43.783
You think you're
losing it?

11:43.828 --> 11:45.784
I know this woman!
You know this woman!

11:46.623 --> 11:48.955
All right, maybe something's
affected your body chemistry

11:49.000 --> 11:51.286
or altered your neural
pathway somehow.

11:51.336 --> 11:52.416
Were you exposed
to anything?

11:52.462 --> 11:55.078
Yeah, I visited a guy.
He was playing with

11:55.715 --> 11:56.875
a new

11:58.718 --> 11:59.958
Atlantic element.

12:00.053 --> 12:01.133
Transuranic?

12:01.221 --> 12:02.711
Yes! Yeah, that's it.
Would that do it?

12:02.764 --> 12:04.174
No.

12:04.265 --> 12:05.425
Okay. What else
have we got?

12:05.516 --> 12:06.847
Well, uh...

12:07.852 --> 12:09.183
Maybe, uh...

12:10.521 --> 12:12.512
All right, maybe you fell
into some freezing water

12:12.607 --> 12:14.347
and you went into hypothermia.

12:14.817 --> 12:18.685
Or you suffered a trauma,
and that sent you into shock.

12:19.280 --> 12:20.269
Well...

12:20.657 --> 12:22.613
Yeah, I hit my head.
With what?

12:22.700 --> 12:24.076
A heavy metal object.

12:24.118 --> 12:25.278
How many times?

12:25.370 --> 12:26.576
Repeatedly.

12:26.621 --> 12:28.612
Well, see?
That would have some effect.

12:28.706 --> 12:30.958
So if that's our problem,

12:31.000 --> 12:32.080
get an MRI.

12:32.126 --> 12:34.412
Henry, I've had
a concussion before.
That's not it.

12:34.462 --> 12:36.498
Do you remember
Occam's razor?

12:36.965 --> 12:38.250
Yeah.

12:39.008 --> 12:41.465
"Simple things are true."

12:41.552 --> 12:42.587
Close enough.

12:42.637 --> 12:44.753
So, you are either
part of some

12:45.890 --> 12:48.597
theoretical, unknown
scientific discovery

12:48.643 --> 12:52.386
where people vanish
from our world and memories,

12:52.438 --> 12:54.178
or you suffered
a head trauma.

12:55.066 --> 12:56.931
Well, when you
say it like that...

12:56.985 --> 12:58.270
Get an MRI.

12:58.611 --> 12:59.771
Yeah.

13:00.905 --> 13:01.940
(SIGHS)

13:05.451 --> 13:07.533
I'm not saying that
you can't have one.

13:07.620 --> 13:09.952
I'm just asking why
do you want one?

13:10.039 --> 13:11.904
It's not a big deal.
It's just...

13:11.958 --> 13:13.539
I bumped my head
this morning and
Henry thought

13:13.626 --> 13:15.742
it'd be a good idea
if! had it looked at.

13:15.795 --> 13:18.411
You having any dizziness,
nausea,headaches?

13:18.506 --> 13:21.088
No, my head was
pounding earlier,
but it's fine now.

13:21.175 --> 13:22.676
Actually,

13:22.760 --> 13:24.091
it's totally fine now.

13:24.721 --> 13:26.086
Problem solved.

13:26.848 --> 13:28.179
What's he even
doing here?

13:28.224 --> 13:29.839
He works here.

13:29.892 --> 13:31.723
He was fired weeks ago.

13:33.938 --> 13:37.226
Okay, brain scan it is.
Run an EEG and draw blood.

13:37.275 --> 13:39.186
No, ljust need
an MRI, thanks.

13:39.694 --> 13:43.403
Relax, it usually only
takes me two or three
tries to hit a vein.

13:43.448 --> 13:44.688
You're pretty talented.

13:44.782 --> 13:45.862
Really?

13:45.950 --> 13:47.030
No!

13:47.368 --> 13:50.610
Do you know anyone
who'd be working
on a really intense,

13:50.705 --> 13:53.617
unknown, theoretical
scientific discovery?

13:53.708 --> 13:55.790
You mean,
like a Class Eight project?

13:56.419 --> 13:57.499
Yes.

13:57.545 --> 13:59.001
Let's talk about those.

13:59.047 --> 14:01.754
Sorry, all Class Eight
research is classified.

14:01.799 --> 14:02.914
Mmm-hmm.

14:02.925 --> 14:05.257
Oh, you know what else
should be classified?

14:05.261 --> 14:08.753
A certain assistant's
American Idol audition.

14:08.765 --> 14:11.757
What? No, no!
Zoe promised me she
was gonna delete that.

14:11.851 --> 14:13.261
(WHISPERS)
What's it gonna be?

14:13.353 --> 14:15.765
(WHISPERS) Fine!
Give me an hour.

14:15.772 --> 14:20.106
All right, so put the gown
on and all metal objects
and jewelry in the tray.

14:20.193 --> 14:21.603
All right.

14:23.946 --> 14:25.277
Are you okay?

14:25.281 --> 14:26.612
Uh, yeah.

14:26.699 --> 14:28.109
Just got a lot
on my mind.

14:28.117 --> 14:30.108
You know, you can
always talk to Beverly.

14:30.161 --> 14:31.150
(CHUCKLES)

14:32.288 --> 14:35.780
First of all, no.
And second of all,
she's out of town.

14:35.833 --> 14:38.245
No, she's not.
I just saw her
at Cafe Diem.

14:38.294 --> 14:41.627
Well, then why's she
having Zoe do therapy
from home today?

14:41.756 --> 14:44.168
I don't know,
but is Zoe okay?

14:44.926 --> 14:45.915
Uh...

14:46.260 --> 14:47.796
Actually, not so much.

14:47.929 --> 14:49.135
No.

14:49.263 --> 14:51.254
Abby's taking her back
to LA at the end of
the semester

14:51.307 --> 14:53.593
as a part of our
custody agreement.

14:53.643 --> 14:55.304
And are you
okay with that?

14:55.436 --> 14:56.425
Um.

14:57.980 --> 14:59.015
Yeah.

14:59.690 --> 15:00.770
It's complicated.

15:00.775 --> 15:03.312
Well, what do you think
you should do about this?

15:04.445 --> 15:06.481
I don't know.
What can I do?

15:06.572 --> 15:09.814
I don't know, but if
someone was gonna take
Kevin away from me,

15:09.867 --> 15:11.823
I would feel like
my world was ending.

15:14.747 --> 15:15.953
Yeah.

15:16.999 --> 15:18.455
Let's get this over with.

15:20.211 --> 15:21.291
(DOOR OPENING)

15:21.921 --> 15:23.206
Hey, how's your head?

15:23.297 --> 15:25.504
A waste of time.
The MRI was clear.

15:25.591 --> 15:27.877
Well, I wouldn't rule out
your injury just yet.

15:27.969 --> 15:29.834
It might not
be me, though.

15:29.929 --> 15:32.591
I mean, it might be
a Class Eight project?

15:34.142 --> 15:36.303
And what do you know
about Class Eight projects?

15:36.352 --> 15:38.593
Mainly that I'm not
supposed to know
about them.

15:38.646 --> 15:40.182
Yeah, that's true,
and I don't think
that's your problem,

15:40.273 --> 15:42.480
'cause most of that
research is theoretical.

15:42.567 --> 15:45.229
I know, I know,
and I know what I'm
asking isn't probable,

15:45.319 --> 15:46.525
but is it possible?

15:46.612 --> 15:50.480
Yeah, well, it might have
something to do with
metamaterial technology

15:50.575 --> 15:54.614
or vector decomposition
or cellular irradiation.

15:54.662 --> 15:55.651
Okay.

15:55.746 --> 15:59.955
But none of those things
could remove someone from
the world's consciousness.

16:00.042 --> 16:04.706
Unless, it was some kind
of transdimensional travel.

16:04.755 --> 16:06.711
Okay, let's go with that.
What's that?

16:06.757 --> 16:08.884
Movement between
parallel universes.

16:08.926 --> 16:09.915
Right.

16:09.969 --> 16:13.928
So you're saying
that Jo got zapped
to another universe?

16:13.973 --> 16:15.053
Or maybe you did.

16:15.099 --> 16:17.055
Theoretically,
every universe is different.

16:17.101 --> 16:19.057
But the closer they are,
the more alike they are,

16:19.103 --> 16:20.434
with maybe just
one difference.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.641
A green sky instead of blue,
cats chase dogs or...

16:22.732 --> 16:25.565
Or in a town of 3,000 people,
one of them isn't where
they're supposed to be.

16:25.610 --> 16:26.770
Exactly.

16:27.612 --> 16:29.398
You know what,
we should go talk
to Nathan about this.

16:29.447 --> 16:30.903
He's really good
with this kind of thing.

16:30.948 --> 16:32.449
Great! Thanks.

16:32.825 --> 16:33.985
You're welcome.

16:34.076 --> 16:36.567
You know, I was really
starting to worry if it
was something to do with me.

16:36.621 --> 16:38.953
Well, that's where
the smart money still is.

16:39.081 --> 16:40.241
Funny.

16:46.547 --> 16:47.878
Henry?

16:48.925 --> 16:50.085
Henry?

16:53.387 --> 16:54.638
Henry!

17:17.036 --> 17:18.116
(SIGHS)

17:22.667 --> 17:24.703
You wanna run that
by me one more time?

17:24.752 --> 17:26.959
People are disappearing
into this crazy light,

17:27.046 --> 17:29.082
and nobody remembers
them but me.

17:29.131 --> 17:30.382
People like...

17:30.424 --> 17:33.587
What difference does it make?
You're not gonna know
who I'm talking about anyway.

17:33.636 --> 17:34.671
Carter.
Stark?

17:34.762 --> 17:36.093
I'm gonna double-check
your MRI.

17:36.138 --> 17:38.049
There's nothing
wrong with my head.

17:38.099 --> 17:40.385
Well, what you're describing
simply is impossible.

17:40.434 --> 17:44.268
There's no technology that
could create such an anomaly.
Not even in Eureka.

17:44.313 --> 17:47.146
Well, how about
many-materials technology?

17:47.233 --> 17:50.646
Or, like, the cell phone
radiation or decomposing
vectors?

17:50.736 --> 17:52.647
And now you're just
putting words together.

17:52.738 --> 17:56.151
Okay, I don't know
what I'm talking about,
but Henry said that you would.

17:56.242 --> 17:57.277
Henry?

17:57.368 --> 17:59.154
Henry Deacon. The...

17:59.245 --> 18:00.610
How do you not remember...

18:00.663 --> 18:02.699
He was a friend of yours.

18:02.748 --> 18:03.908
I have a lot of friends.

18:04.000 --> 18:07.083
Actually, not so much.
But we'll table that.

18:07.169 --> 18:09.501
I think it has something
to do with me, okay?

18:09.589 --> 18:12.422
People I interact with,
people I know,
but whatever it is,

18:12.508 --> 18:15.591
we have to figure it out
before it affects the other
3,000 people in this town.

18:15.678 --> 18:16.884
You see, now I know
it's in your head,

18:16.929 --> 18:18.920
because Eureka's
only half that size.

18:19.015 --> 18:20.676
That means it's spreading.

18:21.559 --> 18:23.049
Nathan, you got
to help me.

18:24.729 --> 18:25.764
Okay.

18:25.855 --> 18:27.720
Great. Where do we start?

18:28.608 --> 18:30.223
You start by going home
and getting some rest.

18:30.276 --> 18:32.517
And I'll start by
double-checking your MRI.

18:32.862 --> 18:33.851
You...

18:34.614 --> 18:35.603
(SIGHS)

18:39.243 --> 18:41.450
Come on. Come on.

18:42.580 --> 18:43.990
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

18:46.167 --> 18:47.577
CARTER: Zoe?
Hey, what's up?

18:47.918 --> 18:50.330
Hey, where are you?

18:50.379 --> 18:51.414
Home. Why?

18:51.505 --> 18:53.166
All right, stay put.
Okay?

18:54.383 --> 18:56.248
What's happening?
I don't know,

18:56.344 --> 18:58.585
but if you see a big flash
of light, I need you to run,
all right?

18:58.679 --> 19:00.510
Just get away from it,
and you call me, okay?

19:00.556 --> 19:01.671
Seriously?

19:01.766 --> 19:03.097
Yeah, seriously.

19:04.852 --> 19:06.513
I'll be in touch.
Got to go.

19:06.604 --> 19:07.764
Fargo!

19:08.481 --> 19:09.596
Fargo.

19:10.274 --> 19:11.605
Did you get it?

19:12.443 --> 19:15.105
Yes, but you can't tell
anyone I showed this
to you.

19:15.196 --> 19:18.438
If you don't show it to me,
there might not be anyone
left to tell.

19:19.950 --> 19:21.281
I have no idea
what that means.

19:21.369 --> 19:22.654
You don't have to.

19:23.245 --> 19:24.496
Why do you
need it anyway?

19:24.580 --> 19:26.787
You wouldn't believe me
if I told you.

19:26.916 --> 19:29.123
Huh! Stark's on
this list.

19:29.251 --> 19:30.912
Of course he is.

19:30.961 --> 19:34.089
He's done more Class Eight
projects than anyone else
at Global.

19:34.173 --> 19:36.004
And this guy,
I know this guy.
I saw him this morning.

19:36.092 --> 19:39.300
Dr. Babajanian?
Yeah, he's a
quantum physicist.

19:39.428 --> 19:42.795
Any chance what he's doing
could punch a hole
in another dimension?

19:42.932 --> 19:46.140
Not likely, but when
you start dealing with
subatomic particles,

19:46.268 --> 19:48.600
the typical laws of
nature no longer apply.

19:48.688 --> 19:50.599
Okay. Thanks.

19:50.606 --> 19:55.020
And you got a great voice.
Don't let anyone
tell you different.

20:01.117 --> 20:02.152
Hey!

20:02.785 --> 20:03.774
Allison.

20:03.911 --> 20:05.321
Hey, Carter.
What's going on?

20:05.413 --> 20:08.576
I need you to come with me.
There's this noise complaint
on the outskirts of town.

20:08.666 --> 20:11.749
This guy, he's using
an element he doesn't
have permission to use.

20:11.794 --> 20:13.079
So make him
get a permit.

20:13.170 --> 20:17.789
Yeah, well, I'm not supposed
to know this, but he's one of
your Class Eight scientists.

20:17.925 --> 20:20.792
Carter, everyone knows
who the Class Eight
scientists are.

20:20.928 --> 20:22.429
Well, Fargo said he's
working with atoms,

20:22.471 --> 20:25.429
and ljust think this guy,
Babajanian, could be
a really serious threat.

20:25.516 --> 20:26.926
Who?
Babajanian.

20:26.976 --> 20:28.591
Weird guy, lives on
the outskirts of town.

20:28.644 --> 20:31.306
Yeah, yeah,
I know who Babajanian is.

20:31.439 --> 20:33.600
Who told you that
he works with atoms?

20:33.649 --> 20:34.764
Fargo.

20:36.485 --> 20:37.770
Oh, man.

20:43.451 --> 20:44.736
Hey, Sheriff.

20:44.827 --> 20:45.942

20:46.328 --> 20:48.410
You hired Larry,
the kiss-ass?

20:48.497 --> 20:49.748
Okay, Carter,
I have work to do.

20:49.749 --> 20:50.829
Allison,

20:51.500 --> 20:53.456
whatever this guy's doing,
it's making people disappear,

20:53.586 --> 20:55.747
and I seem to be the
only one who's noticing.

20:56.422 --> 20:57.753
Please.

20:58.424 --> 20:59.664
Please come with me.

21:01.385 --> 21:02.374

21:16.859 --> 21:18.144
Oh, hey, and watch
yourhead.

21:18.194 --> 21:21.732

machine with lots of
little things spinning...

21:21.822 --> 21:22.811
You'll see.

21:27.453 --> 21:28.818

21:30.498 --> 21:31.863
Dr. Babajanian?

21:33.918 --> 21:34.953
(SIGHS)

21:35.002 --> 21:37.118
This can't be happening.

21:38.964 --> 21:40.750
Can I help you?

21:40.800 --> 21:42.131
Where'd you put it?

21:42.927 --> 21:44.133
Sorry?
Where'd you put it?

21:44.178 --> 21:47.215
The machine with the
lights and swirling...

21:47.306 --> 21:49.012
Could you be
a little more vague?

21:49.099 --> 21:52.091
The thing you built to find
out where the electrons are
and how fast they're moving.

21:52.144 --> 21:54.385
I was right here
this morning. I saw it!

21:54.480 --> 21:56.641
What were you
doing in my lab?

21:56.732 --> 21:59.895
I know you're up to something.
I'm gonna figure out
what it is.

21:59.985 --> 22:01.100
Miss Blake.

22:01.153 --> 22:04.441
I'm sorry about the intrusion,
Dr. Babajanian. Let's go.

22:04.573 --> 22:05.608
Allison...

22:05.658 --> 22:07.899
Carter, there's nothing here.
Let's go.

22:14.625 --> 22:15.956
(CLEARS THROAT)

22:19.463 --> 22:20.578
Move!

22:32.476 --> 22:33.591
Not again.

22:40.734 --> 22:42.895
I can't believe
it got him, too.

22:42.945 --> 22:44.481
What are you
talking about?

22:45.781 --> 22:47.191
You have no idea
what just happened,
do you?

22:47.241 --> 22:49.448
I know you dragged me
out to an empty lab.

22:49.535 --> 22:50.866
(SIGHS)

22:50.911 --> 22:52.572
And you're starting
to scare me.

22:55.916 --> 22:57.417
We got to get
out of here.

23:03.257 --> 23:04.337
Where do you think
you're gonna go?

23:04.425 --> 23:05.414
I'm not sure.

23:05.509 --> 23:07.010
Well, I'm glad you
thought this through.

23:07.094 --> 23:08.550
Well, we'll get Kevin,
we'll get Zoe,

23:08.596 --> 23:10.336
and we'll get the hell out
of Dodge while we still can.

23:10.431 --> 23:12.592
Avoiding the issue isn't
going to help resolve it.

23:12.641 --> 23:15.383
Well, when the issue is
that the people I care
about keep disappearing,

23:15.436 --> 23:17.051
I'm willing to do
whatever it takes.

23:17.104 --> 23:20.141
Carter, listen to me.
I trusted you.
I need you to trust me.

23:20.232 --> 23:23.816
Let's just go back to
the office. I promise,
we will figure this out.

23:23.903 --> 23:25.609
You wanna help? Here.

23:25.654 --> 23:28.191
One of the 20 people
on that list knows
exactly what's going on.

23:28.240 --> 23:29.650
Help me figure
out which one.

23:29.742 --> 23:32.575
Carter, there is nothing
written on this piece
of paper.

23:34.705 --> 23:35.865
Please.

23:35.915 --> 23:37.530
I know that
I can help you.

23:45.591 --> 23:47.923
ALLISON: Carter,
we need to slow down
and talk about this.

23:47.968 --> 23:49.208
I'm telling you,
we got to leave.

23:49.261 --> 23:51.752
It's spreading.
We can't stay.

23:51.805 --> 23:54.933
Carter, just drink some
water and calm down.
You're dehydrated.

23:55.017 --> 23:56.427
I'm dehydrated?
You got to be kidding.

23:56.477 --> 23:57.466
Just drink the water,
all right?

23:57.561 --> 23:58.801
I'm fine.
Just drink it!

23:58.896 --> 24:00.011
Why the hell do
I wanna drink...

24:00.105 --> 24:02.437
ALLISON: So I don't
have to do this.

24:03.359 --> 24:05.600
I'm sorry.
It was for your own good.

24:24.004 --> 24:25.210
How are you feeling?

24:25.506 --> 24:26.495
(GROANS)

24:26.590 --> 24:28.501
Like somebody stabbed
me in the back,

24:29.176 --> 24:30.541
and then stabbed me
in the neck.

24:30.594 --> 24:32.676
I'm sorry,
there's nothing
else I could do.

24:32.721 --> 24:34.177
You were
practically hysterical.

24:34.264 --> 24:37.552
I expect it from Stark.
Not so much you.

24:37.601 --> 24:38.886
Stark?

24:38.936 --> 24:43.179
Ex-husband, Nathan Stark.
Egomaniacal bane
of my existence.

24:43.607 --> 24:46.098
Well, that does sound like
someone that I would marry,

24:46.193 --> 24:47.182
(CHUCKLES)

24:47.277 --> 24:49.108
but, no,
I've never heard of him.

24:59.248 --> 25:01.580
The only way
to fix the problem,

25:01.667 --> 25:03.453
is to recognize
that you have one.

25:03.585 --> 25:05.086
What is that? AA?

25:05.170 --> 25:07.252
Carter...
Allison, don't I...

25:07.256 --> 25:10.919
I mean, apart from
the remembering-people-
that-don't—exist thing,

25:10.926 --> 25:12.666
don't I seem
rational to you?

25:12.761 --> 25:14.752
The former seems
to negate the latter.

25:15.931 --> 25:17.091
Why are you talking
like Beverly?

25:17.141 --> 25:18.426
I'm just trying
to help you.

25:18.475 --> 25:19.760
Okay, then think
this through with me.

25:19.768 --> 25:21.929
How many offices
are there at Global?

25:21.979 --> 25:23.014
Over 1,000.

25:23.105 --> 25:24.766
How many people
work there?

25:24.773 --> 25:25.808
Maybe 100.

25:25.941 --> 25:27.772
Doesn't that seem
odd to you?

25:27.776 --> 25:29.107
We're in a
transitional period.

25:29.153 --> 25:31.895
Or your mind is reaching
to justify what's happening.

25:31.989 --> 25:33.604
I could say
the same for you.

25:34.408 --> 25:35.739
(SIGHS)

25:37.953 --> 25:39.568
Okay.

25:39.580 --> 25:41.241
But you got to
let me go get Zoe.

25:41.331 --> 25:43.822
I can't deal
with losing her.

25:45.419 --> 25:46.579
I won't.

25:47.671 --> 25:48.660
(SIGHS)

25:51.759 --> 25:52.919
Okay.

25:57.431 --> 25:58.796
Thank you.

26:04.688 --> 26:06.895
Allison, come here.
Don't let it touch you.

26:10.611 --> 26:11.851
Allison, move!

26:14.656 --> 26:16.442
Everything's gonna
be all right.

26:34.301 --> 26:36.292
SARAH, door.
SARAH: Is everything okay?

26:36.386 --> 26:38.126
Not even close. Zoe!

26:41.725 --> 26:43.181
Zoe!

26:43.268 --> 26:44.644
What's going on?
Hey, sweetie.

26:44.728 --> 26:46.810
Get your shoes on,
we got to go, okay?

26:46.897 --> 26:48.478
What's happening?
No questions, just go.

26:48.565 --> 26:49.600
All right?

26:49.650 --> 26:51.265
Okay.
Okay, great.

26:51.318 --> 26:54.606
SARAH, how many people
live in Eureka right now?

26:54.655 --> 26:58.147
My current calculations
say two: you and Zoe.

26:59.618 --> 27:00.903
Okay, think.

27:00.953 --> 27:03.365
Think back
to the beginning.

27:05.207 --> 27:06.413
Zoe!

27:07.376 --> 27:08.741
Zoe.
I'm coming.

27:08.794 --> 27:11.206
What do you remember
about this morning?

27:11.255 --> 27:12.540
What do you mean?

27:12.589 --> 27:14.625
Okay, your mom was here
and you and I got in a fight,

27:14.716 --> 27:16.707
you threw the thing at me
and you left, right?

27:16.760 --> 27:19.797
Okay, Mom has never been
to Eureka, I don't remember
getting in a fight with you,

27:19.888 --> 27:22.379
and I don't know what
thing you're talking about.

27:23.308 --> 27:24.809
The thing!

27:24.893 --> 27:26.884
The therapy thingy.
The ATS.

27:27.604 --> 27:28.764
What?

27:28.897 --> 27:30.103
For the love of...

27:32.401 --> 27:34.016
I was sitting here.

27:34.069 --> 27:36.685
And I had it in my hands.

27:38.031 --> 27:39.737
Then I stood up.

27:42.077 --> 27:43.192
Dad?

27:43.245 --> 27:44.530
I never put it down.

27:45.455 --> 27:46.615
So?

27:47.457 --> 27:51.291
So, then I go back
downstairs and I see you
on the couch, right?

27:51.378 --> 27:52.879
And I say that I'm
going off to the office?

27:52.921 --> 27:54.297
Okay, that I remember.

27:54.381 --> 27:55.541
But nothing before that?

27:55.591 --> 27:57.547
Well, nothing that
you've mentioned.

27:57.593 --> 27:59.379
So that's our first
shared memory.

28:00.053 --> 28:01.133
Dad, I have no idea...

28:01.221 --> 28:03.712
What I'm talking about.
I know.
That's the problem.

28:05.517 --> 28:08.930
And the only way to solve
a problem is to recognize
that you have one.

28:09.855 --> 28:11.595
Okay, you sound
like my therapist.

28:11.648 --> 28:13.229
Or a therapy device.

28:13.317 --> 28:14.648
Right? Like the same
one that you had,

28:14.735 --> 28:16.600
the one that I have no
recollection of putting down.

28:16.695 --> 28:18.856
I mean, I must've
tried it on, right?

28:18.906 --> 28:20.988
That's why everybody
sounded like Beverly.

28:21.074 --> 28:22.154
Except you.

28:30.083 --> 28:31.823
This is gonna be
hard to swallow.

28:35.464 --> 28:37.250
I don't think
any of this is real.

28:38.258 --> 28:39.247
Okay.

28:39.343 --> 28:41.459
I think that I'm...

28:41.553 --> 28:42.759
We are

28:43.430 --> 28:44.590
in a program.

28:46.558 --> 28:47.934
And, uh,

28:51.313 --> 28:53.269
I don't know how
to find my way out.

28:53.315 --> 28:54.805
Dad, you're
freaking me out.

28:58.320 --> 28:59.480
Dad?

28:59.947 --> 29:01.562
Dad, can you hear me?

29:02.741 --> 29:04.572
Dad, can you hear me?

29:04.660 --> 29:05.900
Please wake up.

29:11.833 --> 29:13.334
I'm so scared.

29:14.044 --> 29:15.079
Please.

29:19.174 --> 29:21.005
(MONITOR BEEPING)

29:26.723 --> 29:28.509
Oh, sweetie.
Mom.

29:28.558 --> 29:30.423
I drove back as
fast as I could.

29:31.853 --> 29:33.514
What happened?

29:33.772 --> 29:35.728
I was doing my
therapy on the ATS.

29:35.816 --> 29:40.480
And Dad walked in,
and we got in a fight,
and I threw it at him,

29:40.570 --> 29:42.356
and for some reason,
he put it on,

29:42.406 --> 29:46.319
and when I walked back in,
he was shaking and he
wouldn't wake up and...

29:46.368 --> 29:48.233
I shouldn't have
thrown it at him.

29:48.328 --> 29:49.738
Honey,
it's nobody's fault.

29:50.330 --> 29:52.412
Well, can't you
just take this off?

29:52.833 --> 29:56.576
We're afraid that simply
disconnecting him could send
him into paralytic shock.

29:56.670 --> 29:59.252
So what is
happening to him?

30:00.590 --> 30:02.091
Actually,
we're not sure.

30:02.175 --> 30:06.259
The ATS was developed
in collaboration
with Beverly Barlowe,

30:06.346 --> 30:08.086
but we've never had
this happen before.

30:08.181 --> 30:10.558
It's a virtual
version of Eureka,

30:10.600 --> 30:12.340
down to the
very last detail.

30:12.394 --> 30:14.931
The user's subconscious
issues come to life
in the game.

30:15.022 --> 30:18.230
Normally, they're aware
of what they're experiencing

30:18.317 --> 30:19.978
and they can leave
the program at any time.

30:20.068 --> 30:23.560
We think the concussion
may have caused a glitch
in the mainframe,

30:23.655 --> 30:27.398
that Carter is
unaware that he's
in an altered reality.

30:27.492 --> 30:29.357
ls his life in danger?

30:32.581 --> 30:34.037
Someone answer me.

30:34.916 --> 30:36.907
Yes, it is.

30:37.002 --> 30:39.744
So let's get Beverly
down here and fix it.

30:39.838 --> 30:41.044
Well, we can't
reach her.

30:41.089 --> 30:44.377
So we sent Henry to her house
to find any information
that can help us.

30:45.010 --> 30:49.003
Beverly, this is Henry.
I'm in your house now.
We really need your help.

30:49.056 --> 30:51.593
So when you get
this message, call!

31:36.770 --> 31:37.885
ZOE: Dad,
where are we going?

31:37.979 --> 31:41.062
Okay, ifthis isn't real,
there has to be a way out,
right?

31:41.108 --> 31:42.268
Like an exit sign?

31:42.401 --> 31:44.232
Yeah, I'm not that lucky.

31:44.277 --> 31:47.986
You said this therapy thing
is for confronting your fears,
working out anger issues.

31:48.073 --> 31:49.404
Okay, I don't
remember that.

31:49.408 --> 31:50.397
Yeah, well,
you said it.

31:50.492 --> 31:51.902
And I'm not angry.

31:51.910 --> 31:54.777
So maybe confronting
fears is the way out.

31:54.913 --> 31:56.244
Yours or mine?

31:56.289 --> 31:58.826
Well, I'm wearing the thing,
so I'm guessing mine.

32:00.085 --> 32:02.451
Okay, so what
are you afraid of?

taking people.

32:14.641 --> 32:16.347

you doing?

32:16.435 --> 32:17.766
Confronting my fear.

32:30.782 --> 32:32.022

32:33.452 --> 32:35.659
I am so sorry.
Are you okay?

32:36.621 --> 32:37.906

all doing here?

We're here for
Carter and Zoe.

33:04.941 --> 33:08.024
Yeah, I mean,
he's our sheriff,
and she's our girl.

33:15.869 --> 33:17.109
Henry, did you
find anything else?

33:17.204 --> 33:18.364

33:18.413 --> 33:20.404

and we can see what
the mechanics are.

hold on that long.

33:21.875 --> 33:23.035

leave him.

36:14.422 --> 36:16.083
How many of you are there?

36:26.059 --> 36:27.219
Hi.

36:28.228 --> 36:29.388
HENRY: Hey.

36:29.479 --> 36:30.810
Hey, how you feeling?

36:32.273 --> 36:34.229
A little strange.

36:34.275 --> 36:39.235
You know, I have all these
memories and feelings about
things that never happened.

36:39.280 --> 36:41.566
Well, that's got to
be pretty surreal.

36:41.658 --> 36:43.444
You have no idea.

36:44.661 --> 36:47.619
Anyway, ljust stopped by
to see if you were okay.

36:47.747 --> 36:49.248
To see if I'm okay?

36:49.290 --> 36:52.578
Yeah, this is your first
day back in Kim's lab.
I know that's a big deal.

36:52.669 --> 36:56.628
Jack, it's fine. Really.
I mean, you're the one
we should be worrying about.

36:57.590 --> 37:00.582
They told me the therapy
thing was forcing me

37:00.635 --> 37:03.126
to deal with my feelings
about losing Zoe.

37:03.221 --> 37:07.305
Apparently I have abandonment,
entitlement and intimacy
issues.

37:07.392 --> 37:08.848
Congratulations.
Thank you.

37:11.855 --> 37:14.096
Even though that
wasn't actually you,

37:14.190 --> 37:16.101
you helped me
a lot in there.

37:17.360 --> 37:19.271
I don't know what
I'd do without you.

37:20.196 --> 37:21.527
Me, too.

37:23.867 --> 37:25.027
I should get going.

37:25.118 --> 37:27.484
Abby's taking off,
and I've got to talk to her
before she goes, so...

37:27.579 --> 37:31.117
All right, well,
good luck and thanks.

37:32.000 --> 37:33.285
Yeah.

37:45.263 --> 37:46.594
Jack.

37:48.600 --> 37:49.589
Abby.

37:49.684 --> 37:51.265
You wanted me
to stop by.

37:51.311 --> 37:52.426
Yeah.

37:52.479 --> 37:54.595
Yeah, yeah,
I think we should talk.

37:55.398 --> 37:56.604
Yeah, I know.

38:05.742 --> 38:06.731
Uh...

38:08.453 --> 38:09.738
I'm happy here.

38:10.580 --> 38:15.745
Yeah, I know I complain
about it, and it definitely
has its quirks.

38:15.794 --> 38:17.204
Yeah, that's one
way of putting it.

38:17.253 --> 38:18.368
Yeah.

38:19.214 --> 38:22.456
But I belong here.

38:24.594 --> 38:25.674
And I'm doing some good.

38:25.720 --> 38:28.006
You do, and you are.

38:28.056 --> 38:30.172
And I think this place
has been good for Zoe.

38:30.225 --> 38:32.591
You know, I think she
fits in here, somehow.

38:32.685 --> 38:35.347
Well, maybe it's 'cause
she doesn't fit in
anywhere else.

38:35.396 --> 38:36.385
(SNIFFLES)

38:36.523 --> 38:38.184
She has some
good friends.

38:38.233 --> 38:39.769
Yeah, I've noticed that.

38:39.859 --> 38:43.226
And I would never ask you
to, you know, not take her.

38:43.363 --> 38:45.228
That wouldn't be fair
to you or Zoe.

38:45.365 --> 38:46.354
Jack, listen, I...

38:46.407 --> 38:47.863
That being said,

38:51.037 --> 38:54.746
I can't go months
without seeing my kid.

38:56.793 --> 38:58.875
Can't even go
days, really.

39:01.089 --> 39:05.378
So, I'm gonna ask
for myjob back in LA.

39:05.426 --> 39:06.677
Really?

39:06.719 --> 39:07.879
Yep.

39:08.680 --> 39:11.547
That's funny. You remind me
of a man I once married.

39:15.478 --> 39:16.467
(SIGHS)

39:18.398 --> 39:19.683
So what do you think?

39:19.732 --> 39:21.984
I think this place needs you.

39:22.068 --> 39:26.402
And it wasn't until today
that I realized just how
much Zoe needs you.

39:27.365 --> 39:29.447
And I can't take you
away from here.

39:30.410 --> 39:32.526
I can't take her
away from you.

39:32.579 --> 39:33.568
But...

39:33.663 --> 39:35.324
This is where
she needs to be.

39:45.675 --> 39:46.710
Abby?

39:52.932 --> 39:54.263
Thank you.

39:55.226 --> 39:56.841
I love you,
Jack Carter.

40:09.616 --> 40:10.605
(DOOR CLOSING)

40:13.244 --> 40:14.575
SARAH, door.

40:18.625 --> 40:20.490
Zoe?
SARAH: Good evening,
Sheriff Carter.

40:20.585 --> 40:22.917
Will the former Mrs. Carter
be joining you for dinner?

40:22.962 --> 40:25.169
Oh, relax, SARAH, she's gone.

40:25.673 --> 40:27.254
What a shame.

40:28.384 --> 40:30.090
Sarcasm doesn't
become you.

40:30.929 --> 40:31.918
Is...

40:33.973 --> 40:35.634
Zoe?

40:35.725 --> 40:37.056
What are you doing?

40:37.101 --> 40:40.389
Oh, I'm sorry, I meant to have
all this cleaned up
before you got home.

40:40.480 --> 40:44.189
Oh, it's okay.
It doesn't matter.
Leaveit

40:46.361 --> 40:48.477
Your mom and I had a talk.

40:50.448 --> 40:56.068
I told her how much
you love it here and
that you wanna stay.

40:57.956 --> 40:59.492
(CLEARS THROAT)

40:59.582 --> 41:02.995
And I told her that I would
respect our agreement.

41:04.712 --> 41:05.701
Oh.

41:07.465 --> 41:09.046
What did she say?

41:09.133 --> 41:13.797
She seems to think that
I need adult supervision.

41:16.307 --> 41:18.684
So, if you're up
for the task...

41:19.644 --> 41:21.805
I think I can
handle it.

41:21.896 --> 41:23.011
Yeah.

41:28.361 --> 41:30.022
I never wanted
you to leave.

41:30.989 --> 41:32.900
I never wanted to go.

41:36.869 --> 41:38.245
Dad, um,

41:40.415 --> 41:43.703
thank you for
fighting for me.

41:52.135 --> 41:54.046
(SOFT MUSIC PLAYING)

41:54.137 --> 41:55.217
SARAH,
what are you doing?

41:55.304 --> 41:56.885
That was such
a beautiful moment,

41:56.973 --> 41:59.885
I thought musical
accompaniment
seemed appropriate.

41:59.976 --> 42:01.887
Yeah, on second thought,
LA's not looking so bad.

42:01.894 --> 42:06.228
Well, you're stuck with us
now, so, what do you say,
burgers, Cafe Diem?

42:06.232 --> 42:07.392
Sounds good.

42:07.400 --> 42:08.435
(SOFT MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING)

42:08.568 --> 42:10.399
Oh, SARAH,
knock it off.
