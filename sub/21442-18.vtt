Welcome back to another episode

00:11.044 --> 00:13.113
In ten years of doing this,
we've done a lot of videos

00:13.179 --> 00:14.748
with a lot of different people.
- Yep.

00:14.814 --> 00:16.483
- But you know who
we've never filmed with?

00:16.549 --> 00:17.550
- Santa?
- Who?

00:17.617 --> 00:19.419
- Well, that is true.

00:19.486 --> 00:21.788
But some of our biggest
supporters of all-time.

00:21.855 --> 00:23.923
Our moms!
- Oh, wow.

00:23.990 --> 00:25.992

had a lot of fun.

00:26.059 --> 00:28.795

01:33.526 --> 01:35.094
So many some kind of
tennis shot there.

she was a track star.

01:37.297 --> 01:38.465
- Yes.

01:38.531 --> 01:40.200

growing up, there was

01:40.266 --> 01:41.534
a devastating knee injury
at some point,

01:41.601 --> 01:43.803
so it was hard to prove it.
- They never believe me.

01:43.870 --> 01:44.771
Never believe me.

01:44.838 --> 01:46.272
- How 'bout a basketball shot?

07:44.931 --> 07:46.265
- She's gonna stand
about right here.

07:46.332 --> 07:47.433
- Okay.

07:47.500 --> 07:49.168
- Bowl the bowling ball
around the rink.

07:49.235 --> 07:50.736
- I like it.

07:50.803 --> 07:53.239
- And then we'll have the pins
set up right around over there.

07:53.306 --> 07:55.408

- Still am.

the triangle going?

08:12.725 --> 08:14.060

because I'm not sure

11:13.506 --> 11:14.707
how great of spellers we are.

11:14.774 --> 11:17.243
We got a little bit
of training to do.

11:17.309 --> 11:18.677
It could be frightening.

11:18.744 --> 11:21.814

on a spelling level right now.

there's nothing on the line.

like a pressure situation

11:41.734 --> 11:43.602
to test your spelling ability.

11:43.669 --> 11:45.004
Rules are simple.

11:45.071 --> 11:47.773

read a dictionary word.

13:02.314 --> 13:04.250

I want him to feel the pressure.

- It means absolutely nothing.
- I think that was a good start.

I think we need a little bit
more training

14:39.878 --> 14:41.313

14:41.380 --> 14:43.015
I've been to
the National Spelling Bee twice.

14:43.082 --> 14:44.883
The first time,
I was a semifinalist.

14:44.950 --> 14:46.518
And the second time,
I placed fifth.

14:46.585 --> 14:47.820
- Yeah, I definitely
watched you.

14:47.886 --> 14:49.755
You were in the top five.
- Yeah.

14:49.822 --> 14:50.889
- I watched the top ten.

14:50.956 --> 14:52.391
- She's top five.
- Wow.

14:52.458 --> 14:54.827
- Why don't you tell us what
you know about The Machine?

14:54.893 --> 14:56.061
What's his weakness?

14:56.128 --> 14:58.364
- Well, he is relatively
very new to spelling.

14:58.430 --> 15:00.766
As you all know, he won
on his first appearance

15:00.833 --> 15:02.301
at the National Spelling Bee.

15:02.368 --> 15:04.270
- Was he the first rookie
ever to win?

15:04.336 --> 15:06.438
- Second, in the history
of the spelling bee.

15:06.505 --> 15:07.940
- Should we start?
- Yes.

15:08.007 --> 15:10.342
- Let me take a seat over here.
And we're here for one mission.

15:10.409 --> 15:12.911
And that's to bring down
The Machine.

15:12.978 --> 15:15.381
- A little boy named Nihar.
[laughs]

15:15.447 --> 15:18.951
- Okay, going into our very
first official spelling bee,

15:19.018 --> 15:21.420
what would you say
are the key basic principles

15:21.487 --> 15:22.655
we need to know?

15:22.721 --> 15:24.623
- Okay, the first thing
is be confident.

15:24.690 --> 15:27.693
And if you are confident,
then you're gonna kinda scare

15:27.760 --> 15:29.128
other people
in your spelling bee.

15:29.194 --> 15:30.863
- Be confident.
- Okay.

15:30.929 --> 15:31.864
Smrithi, let's do this.

15:31.930 --> 15:33.399
- Okay.

15:33.465 --> 15:35.434
So I'll show you this flashcard
with the phonetic spelling

15:35.501 --> 15:36.535
of a word.

15:36.602 --> 15:38.604
And see if you can
spell the actual word.

15:38.671 --> 15:40.372
- Alright.
- That's the first one.

15:40.439 --> 15:41.507
- Mis-chu-vus.

15:41.573 --> 15:43.442
- Mischievous.

15:43.509 --> 15:46.111
- So to be clear, that
is not how you spell it?

15:46.178 --> 15:48.047
- No, that is not.
- [laughing]

15:48.113 --> 15:50.516
- Just wanted to put that out.
- But you say it like that.

15:50.582 --> 15:52.484
When you guys ask--to be
used in a sentence,

15:52.551 --> 15:53.519
is that just buying time?

15:53.585 --> 15:54.820
- Sometimes it is.

15:54.887 --> 15:56.889
And sometimes we genuinely
wanna hear

15:56.955 --> 15:58.624
how it sounds in a sentence.

15:58.691 --> 16:00.092
- Any other tips for us?

16:00.159 --> 16:02.428
- You know songs are actually
a great way to memorize words.

16:02.494 --> 16:04.263
- Give me one
of your songs right now.

16:04.330 --> 16:06.231
{\an8}- One of the first words
I learned, it was amoeba.

16:06.298 --> 16:08.133
{\an8}I couldn't remember the OE.

16:08.200 --> 16:11.870
{\an8}So I said the O and the E
makes amoeba, you see.

16:11.937 --> 16:13.272
- ALL: [cheering]

16:13.339 --> 16:15.474

Thank you for that.

16:17.743 --> 16:20.379
- Aw-rang-oo-tan?

16:20.446 --> 16:22.381
- Oran-gutan.

16:22.448 --> 16:24.283
- ♪ Oran-gutan ♪

16:24.350 --> 16:26.385
- I like it.

16:26.452 --> 16:27.386

16:27.453 --> 16:30.422
- Coo-meely-on-in?

16:30.489 --> 16:31.790
- The word is chameleon.

16:31.857 --> 16:33.258
- Oh.

16:33.325 --> 16:35.527
- [laughing]

16:35.594 --> 16:37.496
- Not what I was singing.

16:37.563 --> 16:39.431
- [laughs]

16:39.498 --> 16:42.267
- Like in all honesty though,
what are the odds

16:42.334 --> 16:45.871
of us five misfits
taking down Nihar?

16:45.938 --> 16:49.007
- I'd say like 1 in 1,000.
