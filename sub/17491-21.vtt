20:13.211 --> 20:15.005
Steed, fly!

20:15.088 --> 20:16.673
<i>We had to get</i>
<i>the heck out of there,</i>

20:16.757 --> 20:19.092
<i>so the pig stallion</i>
<i>sprouted bug wings--</i>

20:19.176 --> 20:20.969
<i>Wait, wait, no, no.</i>
<i>Bat wings!</i>

20:21.053 --> 20:22.304
<i>Yeah, that's cooler.</i>

20:22.387 --> 20:23.972
<i>But the Gar-Goat</i>
<i>was chasing us,</i>

20:24.056 --> 20:26.808
<i>and squirting screaming</i>
<i>cricket heads</i>

20:26.892 --> 20:27.935
<i>at us out of her armpits!</i>

20:28.018 --> 20:29.478
- Algebra 1!

20:29.561 --> 20:31.772
Look out, Banana.
Here I come!

20:31.855 --> 20:33.398
The inverse proportion
of a convex shape

20:33.482 --> 20:38.820
is found by inverting
the bisecting points of a solid.

20:38.904 --> 20:40.530
<i>- A cricket head</i>
<i>almost got us,</i>

20:40.614 --> 20:43.742
<i>but it was screaming out</i>
<i>stupid things like science.</i>

20:43.825 --> 20:47.454
<i>So I threw one back at her!</i>
<i>And...whoopee!</i>

20:47.537 --> 20:48.705
- [screaming]
Ow!

20:48.789 --> 20:50.290
<i>- Once I defeated her,</i>

20:50.374 --> 20:53.418
<i>her head exploded</i>
<i>and money spewed everywhere.</i>

20:53.502 --> 20:55.253
[laughing]
I'm rich!

20:55.337 --> 21:00.092
{\an3}And that's the story of how
I became a bajillionaire.

21:00.175 --> 21:03.136
{\an1}- I didn't ask how you became
a bajillionaire.

21:03.220 --> 21:07.015
I asked you how you became
roommates!

21:07.099 --> 21:08.266
{\an3}- Right.
Oh, yeah.

21:08.350 --> 21:11.353
{\an3}Uh, we met at the mall.
Simple-dee-do.

21:11.436 --> 21:12.813
{\an3}[screams]

21:12.896 --> 21:15.357
{\an1}- Those were the
four stupidest stories

21:15.440 --> 21:17.693
I've ever heard in my life.

21:17.776 --> 21:20.195
- Did you tell him the story
I told you to tell him?

21:20.278 --> 21:21.863
The part about meeting
in space?

21:21.947 --> 21:23.949
{\an3}- I may have enhanced it
a little.

21:24.032 --> 21:26.952
{\an1}- I told you, dinguses, to tell
the high school story!

21:27.035 --> 21:28.161
That is the story!

21:28.245 --> 21:29.955
- What is a story?

21:30.038 --> 21:31.540
- Oh, be quiet!

21:31.623 --> 21:36.003
[all arguing]

21:36.086 --> 21:39.131
- Quiet!

21:39.214 --> 21:40.882
I believe you!

21:40.966 --> 21:42.217
all:
You do?

21:42.300 --> 21:43.760
- The way you idiots argue,

21:43.844 --> 21:45.887
it sounds like a bunch
of roommates to me.
