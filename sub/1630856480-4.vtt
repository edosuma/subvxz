WEBVTT

01:09.736 --> 01:11.905
Set up. Three, two, one.

01:19.037 --> 01:24.292
I'm most passionate and motivated
about football, yes,

01:24.375 --> 01:29.380
but I am more motivated
by working with the Deaf kids.

01:33.551 --> 01:38.765
All of those Deaf-isms,
Deaf traditions, customs,

01:38.848 --> 01:42.185
I can naturally pass on
to my students here.

01:43.978 --> 01:48.858
Here it is 100% guaranteed access
to sign language.

01:50.777 --> 01:53.154
They can be involved in sports,
in theater.

01:54.697 --> 01:58.827
If they go to a hearing school,
would they have the same opportunities?

01:58.910 --> 01:59.911
I doubt it.

02:45.206 --> 02:48.418
I want to be there for my students

02:48.501 --> 02:51.462
the same way my dad was there for me.

03:02.182 --> 03:06.436
"Relax. Take time for yourself. Relax,"

03:06.519 --> 03:08.897
and I'm like, "No, I'm not done."

03:08.980 --> 03:13.026
I need to do everything
that I can for these kids.

03:25.413 --> 03:29.834
I think Denton deserves a bit more…
a little more sprucing up.

03:31.794 --> 03:33.838
Because he's in a leadership position,

03:33.922 --> 03:36.966
he's often, you know,
the face of the sport,

03:37.050 --> 03:38.927
and he's there on the field.

03:39.010 --> 03:42.555
It's really important
for someone like him to look good

03:42.639 --> 03:44.724
to represent our school and our team well.

04:18.800 --> 04:25.014
My feet are throbbing from walking
and doing things all day long.

04:30.270 --> 04:36.234
I'm not sure that he recognizes
how much we see his dedication

04:36.317 --> 04:41.239
and his passion for our school,
our community, and our students.

05:48.306 --> 05:49.891
…and you'll go through.

05:55.688 --> 05:57.231
Good to meet you.

06:04.155 --> 06:04.989
How are you?

06:16.042 --> 06:17.001
Seven years.

06:20.713 --> 06:22.298
-We wanna see the locker rooms.
-Yeah.

06:25.426 --> 06:27.261
- Bye! Love.
-Let's go, hustle!

07:08.428 --> 07:09.637
Oh yes, I have to be.

07:09.720 --> 07:11.764
I have to be high energy.

07:11.848 --> 07:14.434
From morning to noon, all day long.

07:14.517 --> 07:19.188
-I love it. Sports, school with the kids.
- Aw.

07:19.272 --> 07:22.233
-That is my favorite part of the day.
- Aw.

07:25.778 --> 07:26.737
Let's go.

07:34.203 --> 07:35.413
That's our concession stand.

07:40.251 --> 07:41.252
Two years ago.

07:45.465 --> 07:48.968
Popcorn, hot dogs.

07:50.178 --> 07:51.387
Come on.

08:29.926 --> 08:30.760
Football.

08:36.933 --> 08:37.808
Yes.

08:41.979 --> 08:46.567
Sports has always been one of my outlets.

08:46.651 --> 08:50.071
Some days
everything would just go over my head.

08:50.154 --> 08:52.281
I would be burned out and exhausted

08:52.365 --> 08:54.450
from trying to speak and lip-read.

08:54.534 --> 08:58.454
It was hard to develop relationships
with my hearing classmates.

09:01.082 --> 09:04.126
Sports was one of those ways
that I could actually relax

09:04.210 --> 09:05.920
and express my emotions.

09:07.296 --> 09:12.009
And then I joined football
at a Deaf school and fell in love.

09:12.969 --> 09:17.098
Because my father loved football himself,

09:19.433 --> 09:22.436
it really developed a close bond
between us.

09:24.188 --> 09:26.399
My dad has always been there for me.

09:26.482 --> 09:29.026
I want that same experience for the kids

09:29.110 --> 09:32.363
because some of these kids
don't have that role model.

09:36.701 --> 09:37.994
Exactly.

09:40.705 --> 09:42.707
It's hard for me to see it.

09:42.790 --> 09:48.337
I hope I can be able
to support and motivate them.

09:49.547 --> 09:52.216
I have to make sure
their future is bright.

09:55.011 --> 09:55.845
Yeah.

10:04.353 --> 10:05.479
Eagle.

10:09.692 --> 10:12.695
Really, that's been here for a long time,

10:12.778 --> 10:14.655
maybe the '80s or the '90s,

10:14.739 --> 10:16.782
and it's just been the same ever since.

10:16.866 --> 10:21.162
It's hard to fundraise
and do this sort of thing and renovate.

10:24.957 --> 10:30.421
In the 1970s, we had over 300 students.

10:32.131 --> 10:34.508
Over time,
the number of students dwindled.

10:35.509 --> 10:37.303
Now we have about 90 students.

10:39.347 --> 10:44.435
More and more students
are moving over to mainstream schools.

10:44.518 --> 10:48.314
Maybe because parents,
when they give birth to a Deaf baby,

10:48.397 --> 10:53.778
often the doctor or audiologist
will say, "Hey, you know what?"

10:53.861 --> 10:57.198
"It's better to learn to speak, lip-read,

10:57.281 --> 10:59.241
use hearing aids or cochlear implants."

10:59.325 --> 11:01.535
They don't really mention learning ASL.

11:17.510 --> 11:19.428
Right, exactly. Yes.

11:32.817 --> 11:34.735
Yes, definitely.

11:34.819 --> 11:37.738
Really, I want to see something inspiring.

11:43.369 --> 11:44.954
Protect the nest!

12:31.459 --> 12:33.794
You all had a fun practice.

12:35.379 --> 12:37.131
I will see you soon.

12:42.762 --> 12:45.514
That's pretty much everything
that I use for school.

12:52.021 --> 12:54.565
I mean, I've gotten most of these clothes
from school.

12:55.608 --> 12:57.234
Why say no to freebies? You know?

13:09.497 --> 13:10.414
I mean, it's easier.

13:10.498 --> 13:14.627
It's an easier transition from school
to the football field for practice.

13:44.615 --> 13:45.741
Yas, queen.

13:45.825 --> 13:46.784
Yas, queen.

13:49.995 --> 13:51.539
They've been popping up now…

13:51.622 --> 13:54.166
For the past two or three years,
they've been popping up.

13:56.043 --> 13:58.212
A little, yeah.

14:17.815 --> 14:18.816
Yes.

14:20.526 --> 14:21.735
Yes, definitely.

14:21.819 --> 14:25.739
Sometimes I have a lot of different things
I've got to do.

14:25.823 --> 14:29.159
Where do I begin?

14:29.243 --> 14:31.954
So I start over here, then I go here
doing all these different things.

14:32.037 --> 14:37.167
I feel like
I never run out of things to do.

14:59.815 --> 15:03.235
Yes, I'm willing. Yes.

15:21.378 --> 15:22.838
Peanut butter sandwich.

15:24.131 --> 15:25.758
Keep in mind there's no jelly.

15:28.719 --> 15:32.681
That is what I have been doing
since I was a kid all along.

15:34.850 --> 15:37.686
Oh yes. Absolutely.

15:37.770 --> 15:39.855
Don't fix what's not broken.

15:39.939 --> 15:41.649
Growing up,

15:41.732 --> 15:47.321
what did you love to eat?

15:47.821 --> 15:51.158
Growing up, what food did I love?

15:51.241 --> 15:52.618
Okay.

15:52.701 --> 15:57.498
I loved my dad's sloppy joes.

15:57.581 --> 15:59.541
Not from the can, from scratch.

16:10.010 --> 16:11.095
Favorite.

16:18.727 --> 16:20.270
I'm ready whenever you are ready.

16:23.315 --> 16:24.775
Let's go.

17:57.576 --> 17:59.161
Suit shopping?

18:09.880 --> 18:11.215
Awesome!

18:36.865 --> 18:38.325
Not exactly.

18:39.743 --> 18:44.832
So now I'm just kind of figuring it out
and how I fit into that role.

18:49.461 --> 18:52.589
I'm used to working behind the scenes,

18:52.673 --> 18:54.508
encouraging, motivating,
and supporting others.

18:54.591 --> 18:56.009
That's my passion.

19:24.246 --> 19:25.289
Yes.

19:26.415 --> 19:27.291
Yes.

19:29.168 --> 19:30.919
Try anything?

19:35.674 --> 19:37.467
I think pink looks good on me.

19:42.598 --> 19:43.432
Okay.

19:54.735 --> 19:56.653
Really nice.

19:56.737 --> 19:57.905
Wow!

20:20.052 --> 20:22.804
The pants are really comfortable.

20:35.525 --> 20:36.902
The jacket's nice.

20:37.903 --> 20:40.572
The fabric's a little bit like…

20:40.656 --> 20:45.077
I'm going to say
it conflicts a little with signing.

20:55.212 --> 20:56.838
Oh yes.

20:56.922 --> 21:01.510
I feel more elevated, more serious.

21:01.593 --> 21:04.763
Like a serious persona walking around.

21:04.846 --> 21:06.265
I'm walking the walk. You know?

21:09.977 --> 21:11.228
That's great.

21:30.414 --> 21:33.542
That's my wife's favorite part about me.

21:37.087 --> 21:41.466
I like it. It's more casual.

21:43.010 --> 21:45.137
"Ooh, you're hot." Hot.

21:45.220 --> 21:46.138
Hot.

22:00.235 --> 22:02.195
Oh yeah, definitely.

22:16.460 --> 22:20.589
Oh yes. I feel ready. I feel good.

22:20.672 --> 22:23.759
I feel like I can see
how people will look at me.

22:23.842 --> 22:26.803
I can see that confidence in me.

22:27.804 --> 22:28.638
Thank you.

22:48.325 --> 22:51.119
What is this place?

22:53.497 --> 22:55.665
No. I don't really know much about it.

23:06.343 --> 23:08.887
Ooh, I taste a little bit of a kick.

23:10.097 --> 23:11.765
All very good.

23:17.687 --> 23:18.814
Yes.

23:23.527 --> 23:25.570
It wasn't until
I was in the seventh grade,

23:25.654 --> 23:27.781
and I went to summer camp
at the Deaf school

23:27.864 --> 23:32.869
where I saw Deaf role models,
and I really started to get involved

23:32.953 --> 23:35.497
with diving into my Deaf identity.

23:36.706 --> 23:39.835
Who better to interact with
and teach Deaf kids

23:39.918 --> 23:44.589
than Deaf adults who've already
experienced and gone through it?

23:45.882 --> 23:48.009
I love my father.

23:48.093 --> 23:49.386
I love my family.

23:49.469 --> 23:51.847
I really do. I appreciate them.

23:51.930 --> 23:57.144
But do they fully understand
what I've gone through?

23:57.227 --> 23:58.061
No, they don't.

23:58.145 --> 24:00.021
It's different.

24:00.730 --> 24:07.362
So it's very important to have a place
we can feel comfortable

24:07.446 --> 24:11.700
in our world, our culture,
our communication, our rhythm.

24:24.045 --> 24:27.215
-Ooh, that's my favorite.
- Ah!

24:29.718 --> 24:30.760
Delicious.

25:15.639 --> 25:17.182
Okay. Sounds good.

25:57.556 --> 25:58.598
Okay.

26:37.679 --> 26:38.555
Very relaxed.

26:39.264 --> 26:40.181
Very loose.

26:40.265 --> 26:43.602
My hips, though, felt tight before,

26:43.685 --> 26:46.688
and now they've kind of melted away.

26:47.564 --> 26:48.815
Yeah.

27:11.296 --> 27:12.964
Hmm, no.

27:13.048 --> 27:16.092
Tan's volume is cool, yes,

27:16.176 --> 27:18.595
but it doesn't fit me.

27:18.678 --> 27:20.972
-I don't know about that.
-I like it more tame.

27:26.811 --> 27:27.979
What's that?

27:31.358 --> 27:35.737
Like, "suave."

27:38.782 --> 27:42.744
I typically always have
a mustache and a goatee.

27:49.834 --> 27:50.835
All right.

27:57.384 --> 28:00.095
Oh yes, for sure.

28:01.513 --> 28:05.350
They're motivated. They're excited.

28:05.433 --> 28:08.186
Finally get to get their feet
on the field.

28:08.269 --> 28:11.106
And they're also looking forward
to seeing people come out

28:11.189 --> 28:13.566
to the school and watch our game.

28:21.116 --> 28:23.034
My butt chin.

28:23.118 --> 28:24.828
-You have a butt chin?
-Yes.

28:35.338 --> 28:37.048
Maybe a summer job.

28:39.217 --> 28:42.887
-Ready to see the new gorgeous you?
-I'm ready.

28:49.936 --> 28:50.854
Wow!

28:51.396 --> 28:52.230
Interesting.

28:53.148 --> 28:54.524
They're really nice.

28:54.607 --> 28:55.483
Awesome.

28:58.445 --> 29:00.447
I didn't think it'd look like this.

29:02.198 --> 29:04.993
Yeah. When you see it
on movie stars on TV and everything,

29:05.076 --> 29:08.872
they have a five-o'clock shadow like that.
I never imagined it would look like this.

29:11.499 --> 29:12.500
Oh yeah!

29:12.584 --> 29:14.919
I feel I can walk the walk.

29:15.003 --> 29:19.549
I feel like I can go up to the referees
and talk to them

29:19.632 --> 29:21.885
and show power,
and express it with this look.

29:22.427 --> 29:27.640
I greatly appreciate you
and how you've taken care of me.

29:27.724 --> 29:32.562
So I want to give you your sign name.

29:33.563 --> 29:34.981
-Are you ready?
- Mm-hmm.

29:35.064 --> 29:37.901
The number five hand…

29:41.571 --> 29:42.822
Why?

29:43.323 --> 29:44.157
First,

29:44.240 --> 29:46.493
you are so friendly.

29:47.577 --> 29:49.037
The second reason why…

29:49.120 --> 29:52.457
Your eyes radiate. They're bright.

29:54.876 --> 29:56.085
And the third reason.

29:56.169 --> 29:57.670
You are you.

29:57.754 --> 30:01.049
You are unapologetically you.

30:04.135 --> 30:06.346
I've noticed, often,
you tend to flip your hair.

30:06.429 --> 30:08.431
And you flip it back, you know?

30:08.515 --> 30:09.432
So, "JVN."

30:09.516 --> 30:10.475
JVN.

30:12.352 --> 30:13.853
-JVN.
- Ah!

30:13.937 --> 30:14.854
Yes.

30:31.246 --> 30:32.121
LSU.

30:55.103 --> 30:55.937
Really?

31:02.652 --> 31:04.529
Hello!

31:15.456 --> 31:17.542
You guys ready to go inside? You ready?

31:18.585 --> 31:19.544
Yes!

31:19.627 --> 31:20.879
All right, let's go!

31:32.390 --> 31:33.766
War.

31:33.850 --> 31:36.019
Eagles.

31:36.102 --> 31:38.062
Fly.

32:00.627 --> 32:03.171
Imagine a full stadium.

32:03.254 --> 32:05.340
Everybody around here.
You're looking up there.

32:05.423 --> 32:07.759
All that energy. The stands are full.

32:11.304 --> 32:12.555
And we feel the hype.

32:12.639 --> 32:15.725
Hype, yes. Hype, exactly.

32:26.986 --> 32:29.072
Okay. You guys practice.
You ready to practice?

32:29.155 --> 32:30.323
Yes.

32:30.990 --> 32:32.158
All you, John.

32:35.620 --> 32:37.538
-Huddle up!
- You're good?

32:37.622 --> 32:40.249
Happy to be here with the kids
and that they got to experience this.

32:45.004 --> 32:50.176
Really, the kids always make my day.

32:50.259 --> 32:52.804
Every day, they always give me 100%,

32:52.887 --> 32:56.975
so I have to make sure
I give 100% right back and invest in them.

33:06.609 --> 33:12.907
It's difficult. It's not always easy
to stay strong all the time.

33:12.991 --> 33:18.079
I don't want them to miss
any opportunities here at the Deaf school.

33:18.162 --> 33:21.124
If they went to hearing schools,
they wouldn't have those opportunities,

33:21.207 --> 33:23.918
so I really feel that
it's my responsibility to invest in them

33:24.002 --> 33:26.337
and make sure
that they have these opportunities.

33:27.046 --> 33:29.090
I mean, Deaf schools are declining.

33:30.758 --> 33:32.927
If Deaf schools continue to decline,
what's next?

33:33.011 --> 33:35.930
What if sports shut down?

33:36.014 --> 33:38.975
Sports shut down, they lose opportunities.

33:39.058 --> 33:41.394
They won't have that outlet
to express things.

33:43.396 --> 33:45.231
They deserve it!

33:45.314 --> 33:46.899
They deserve it, period.

33:46.983 --> 33:50.737
Outside the community, they don't realize

33:50.820 --> 33:56.659
just how much this school has to offer.

33:56.743 --> 33:58.119
Especially with the sports.

34:01.706 --> 34:07.003
If they lose out on that, I feel like
I'm not doing what I should be doing.

34:08.296 --> 34:10.256
I don't want to be the reason

34:10.339 --> 34:14.761
that everything gets shut down,
that the athletic department shuts down.

34:14.844 --> 34:18.181
You know, the reason they fail.

34:23.811 --> 34:24.771
Yes.

34:30.193 --> 34:31.235
No.

34:33.029 --> 34:36.699
I saw my father do so much for me.

34:36.783 --> 34:40.411
I want to make sure
that I do so much for them

34:40.495 --> 34:43.498
because it's personal to me.

34:48.169 --> 34:53.716
I want to make sure that
this Deaf community continues to thrive.

34:53.800 --> 34:58.179
Not just for them, but for everyone.
Myself included.

34:58.262 --> 35:01.182
I'm just a cog in the machine.

35:06.896 --> 35:10.441
It's hard to see
what I'm actually capable of.

35:21.202 --> 35:23.871
Oh yeah. They're really happy.

36:04.537 --> 36:06.414
Yeah, I understand.

36:16.924 --> 36:18.759
I trust myself.

36:35.109 --> 36:36.235
Yeah.

36:46.954 --> 36:47.997
I'm glad.

36:49.957 --> 36:55.463
Thank you for telling me bluntly.
I really appreciate your honesty.

36:55.546 --> 36:59.926
I'm really proud and happy
to have met you.

37:25.952 --> 37:26.994
Beautiful.

37:31.791 --> 37:34.001
Fabulous!

37:51.769 --> 37:53.396
- Gorgeous!
-Great. Love.

38:03.531 --> 38:05.157
I feel fabulous!

38:32.143 --> 38:34.437
I feel like I'm in love with the shoes.

38:40.568 --> 38:42.945
I really like this.

38:44.280 --> 38:46.615
I'm more aware of my arms.

38:46.699 --> 38:48.868
More impressive,
more powerful, more confident.

38:51.495 --> 38:52.538
Yes.

39:01.213 --> 39:03.716
Let's go to the school.

39:13.726 --> 39:16.020
-The car is pulling up.
-That!

39:36.540 --> 39:38.376
Wow!

39:47.927 --> 39:49.095
You look so handsome.

39:49.178 --> 39:50.012
Thank you.

39:52.932 --> 39:54.934
Gorgeous, that's right.

39:56.018 --> 39:58.312
I am blown away!

40:36.100 --> 40:37.101
Wow!

40:57.955 --> 41:01.167
Wow, it's amazing.

41:01.250 --> 41:03.669
I'm shocked.

41:03.752 --> 41:05.588
I'm speechless.

41:07.631 --> 41:14.597
Now I feel like I actually have something
to make me feel

41:14.680 --> 41:17.475
like I am, you know… I'm the shit.

41:17.558 --> 41:19.018
I'm the athletic director.

41:44.460 --> 41:45.336
Yes.

41:50.549 --> 41:51.550
Yes!

41:59.266 --> 42:00.935
Delicious.

42:01.018 --> 42:04.522
I can taste my dad's recipe for sure.

42:14.490 --> 42:16.242
Wow!

42:28.546 --> 42:32.424
-We need to play the game.
-Wow, that's sick.

42:51.944 --> 42:54.780
Yeah, come on! Make some noise!

43:15.175 --> 43:16.927
Wow.

43:39.742 --> 43:41.535
Massage chairs!

43:53.088 --> 43:54.465
See that?

44:01.847 --> 44:03.307
Yes!

44:07.186 --> 44:09.396
Awesome!

44:21.200 --> 44:23.619
My coach means to me…

44:24.870 --> 44:27.706
I'm so happy to have him as my coach.

44:35.005 --> 44:36.924
I love my coach so much.

44:51.730 --> 44:57.986
So now it's our turn
to make our team successful.

44:58.862 --> 45:04.076
We'll work together.
We're a team. We're all in this.

45:23.846 --> 45:26.390
Okay! Let's go for it!

45:31.562 --> 45:32.521
I love you.

45:32.604 --> 45:34.940
I love you too.

45:36.817 --> 45:38.152
I really just…

45:38.235 --> 45:41.155
This has been a blessed experience.

45:41.238 --> 45:44.616
You know,
this time that I've spent with you all

45:44.700 --> 45:49.329
is one of my favorite memories of my life.

45:50.497 --> 45:53.834
You motivated me to really address things

45:53.917 --> 45:55.669
and experience new things.

45:55.753 --> 45:59.006
And you've given me the ability
to really shoot for the stars.

45:59.089 --> 46:02.259
Take risks. That's what you've taught me.

46:02.342 --> 46:08.724
You've given me the confidence that I need
to become the athletic director.

46:08.807 --> 46:10.893
So thank you so much for that.

46:10.976 --> 46:15.522
And you taught me a lot
of important things, like self-care.

46:15.606 --> 46:21.361
Self-care is the most important thing
to really live a healthy life.

46:23.822 --> 46:30.162
You've really given me so much insight

46:30.245 --> 46:31.079
into myself.

46:32.539 --> 46:34.291
I love you guys!

46:53.977 --> 46:55.270
I feel it.

47:47.114 --> 47:50.409
Denton, you have visitors outside. Come.

47:57.624 --> 47:59.126
Hey, Coach.

47:59.209 --> 48:00.711
How are you?

48:15.934 --> 48:17.185
I'm happy to see you.

48:23.525 --> 48:24.359
Surprise.

48:24.443 --> 48:25.903
Surprise!

48:25.986 --> 48:27.529
I had no idea!

48:28.822 --> 48:32.326
Do you want to come
inside the locker room?

48:32.409 --> 48:34.995
You can see the pep speech.

48:35.078 --> 48:37.122
-Yes.
-Come on.

48:39.082 --> 48:41.835
All right, everybody. Sit.

48:46.173 --> 48:48.967
I know you're nervous.

48:49.051 --> 48:54.723
But if you overcome yourself,

48:54.806 --> 48:58.685
you will rise.

48:59.645 --> 49:01.605
So I'm going to ask you,

49:03.023 --> 49:08.153
will you be able to rise up
and challenge yourself?

49:10.197 --> 49:11.573
-Who are you?
-War Eagles!

49:11.657 --> 49:13.825
-Who are you?
-War Eagles!

49:45.816 --> 49:47.150
Let's go.

49:59.162 --> 50:00.622
You, you, wide receiver.

50:15.512 --> 50:16.471
Good job.

50:30.569 --> 50:34.489
The biggest thing
that I have learned from this journey

50:34.573 --> 50:38.118
is really to trust myself.

50:39.077 --> 50:40.537
Go to the locker room.

50:40.620 --> 50:41.872
I belong.

50:42.622 --> 50:44.791
I belong in this role.

50:48.128 --> 50:53.091
I feel the future here at LSD
will be in good hands.
