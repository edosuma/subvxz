WEBVTT

00:00.767 --> 00:01.867
PREVIOUSLY
ON "GREY'S ANATOMY"...

00:01.900 --> 00:04.400
THERE'S NOTHING SEXUAL
BETWEEN YOU AND GEORGIE?
MOM!

00:04.433 --> 00:06.800
DON'T YOU DARE COME TO ME
FOR FORGIVENESS,

00:06.833 --> 00:08.300
YOU TRAITOROUS BITCH.
OUR MARRIAGE IS FALLING APART.
YOU'RE NEVER HERE.

00:08.333 --> 00:10.700
(Mark) DR. HAHN--
I HAVE A THING FOR HER.
(Derek) IT'S GONNA END BADLY.

00:10.733 --> 00:13.467
YOU KNOW WHAT?
CARDIO IS MY THING.

00:13.500 --> 00:18.167
YOU ARE FLIRTING WITH CARDIO.
I AM MARRIED TO CARDIO.
YEAH, BUT WHAT IF,
WHILE I'M WAITING,

00:18.200 --> 00:21.067
I MEET SOMEONE WHO IS READY TO
GIVE ME WHAT I WANT FROM YOU?

00:21.100 --> 00:22.467
ARE WE FRIENDS YET?
I'M SORRY?

00:22.500 --> 00:24.233
ARE WE FRIENDS?
(Meredith) I DON'T WANT YOU
TO DATE OTHER PEOPLE.

00:24.267 --> 00:28.033
I DON'T WANT YOU TO DATE
ANYBODY BUT ME.

00:28.067 --> 00:30.033
(Miranda) IN THE BEGINNING,

00:30.067 --> 00:33.033
GOD CREATED THE HEAVEN
AND THE EARTH. AT LEAST
THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY.

00:33.067 --> 00:35.733
HE CREATED THE BIRDS OF THE AIR
AND THE BEASTS OF THE FIELD,

00:35.767 --> 00:38.633
AND HE LOOKED AT HIS CREATION
AND HE SAW THAT IT WAS GOOD.

00:38.667 --> 00:40.333
AND THEN GOD CREATED MAN,

00:40.367 --> 00:43.500
AND IT'S BEEN DOWNHILL
EVER SINCE.

00:43.533 --> 00:45.433
THE WOMAN LOVES ME.
ERICA HAHN?

00:45.467 --> 00:46.633
I'M TELLING YOU.

00:46.667 --> 00:49.400
WE WENT OUT LAST NIGHT,
HAD A COUPLE DRINKS.

00:49.433 --> 00:51.433
YOU AND ERICA?
JUST ME AND HAHN.

00:51.467 --> 00:54.700
AND CALLIE.
(laughs) OH, ALL RIGHT.
SO IT WASN'T A DATE.

00:54.733 --> 00:56.633
YOU GONNA TELL ME
WHERE WE'RE GOING?

00:56.667 --> 00:58.833
WHY DOES IT ALWAYS HAVE TO BE
ABOUT THE DESTINATION?

00:58.867 --> 01:02.167
WHY CAN'T IT BE ABOUT
THE JOURNEY?
'CAUSE I'M WEARING
$300 SHOES.

01:02.200 --> 01:05.067
MEREDITH TOLD ME SHE DOESN'T
WANT ME SEEING OTHER PEOPLE.

01:05.100 --> 01:06.867
SHE FOUND OUT
ABOUT YOU AND ROSE?

01:06.900 --> 01:10.467
NO. THERE'S NOTHING TO FIND OUT.
IT WAS JUST A KISS.
YEAH, BUT YOU'RE NOT
THE KIND OF GUY

01:10.500 --> 01:12.233
WHO MAKES OUT WITH NURSES
IN SCRUB ROOMS.

01:12.267 --> 01:15.200
NOT THAT THERE'S ANYTHING
WRONG WITH THAT.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

01:15.233 --> 01:18.100
I THINK IT WAS
MORE THAN JUST A KISS.
NO, NO, NO, NO, THE VIEW.

01:18.133 --> 01:20.033
WELL, WHAT AM I LOOKING AT?

01:20.067 --> 01:22.800
THE VIEW FROM MY NEW HOUSE.

01:22.833 --> 01:24.733
HUH?

01:24.767 --> 01:26.667
(laughs)

01:26.700 --> 01:27.633
***

01:27.667 --> 01:30.567
THE STORY GOES ON TO SAY
THAT GOD CREATED MAN

01:30.600 --> 01:32.267
IN HIS OWN IMAGE,

01:32.300 --> 01:34.200
BUT THERE'S NOT
MUCH PROOF OF THAT.

01:34.233 --> 01:37.233
AFTER ALL, GOD MADE THE SUN
AND THE MOON AND THE STARS,

01:39.067 --> 01:41.300
IT'S A CLASSIC VICTORIAN DESIGN
WITH AN OPEN FLOOR PLAN.

01:41.333 --> 01:43.833
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
I'M MAKING AN OMELET.

01:43.867 --> 01:45.833
WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF THE HOUSE?

01:45.867 --> 01:48.133
THE HOUSE.
I THINK THE HOUSE IS GREAT.

01:48.167 --> 01:51.667
WELL, IF YOU DON'T LIKE,
YOU KNOW, YOU CAN TELL ME.

01:51.700 --> 01:53.600
IT'S YOUR HOUSE, TOO.

01:53.633 --> 01:55.333
DAMN. UH...

01:55.367 --> 01:57.467
SO WHY ARE YOU
COOKING AGAIN?

01:57.500 --> 02:00.467
LEXIE, UH,
WAS HAVING A BAD NIGHT,

02:00.500 --> 02:03.300
AND I THOUGHT I WOULD
DO SOMETHING SEMI-SISTERLY.

02:03.333 --> 02:04.533
REALLY?

02:04.567 --> 02:05.800
REALLY.

02:05.833 --> 02:07.100
WOW.

02:07.133 --> 02:09.233
(knock on door)

02:09.267 --> 02:10.767
ARE YOU GETTING UP?

02:10.800 --> 02:12.067
NO.

02:12.100 --> 02:13.533
MAYBE.

02:13.567 --> 02:16.233
I DON'T KNOW.

02:17.533 --> 02:18.833
WHAT'S THAT SMELL?

02:18.867 --> 02:20.833
SOMEONE'S COOKING.
THAT'S NOT COOKING.

02:20.867 --> 02:23.333
THAT...
THAT'S NOT COOKING.

02:23.367 --> 02:25.533
YOU'RE GONNA BE LATE.
YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?
I HATE WORK.

02:25.567 --> 02:27.233
SINCE WHEN?

02:27.267 --> 02:28.433
SINCE I HATE IT.

02:28.467 --> 02:31.133
I HATE CRISTINA. I HATE HAHN.
I HATE IT.

02:31.167 --> 02:33.833
OH, WHAT IS THAT SMELL?

02:33.867 --> 02:36.300
(sniffs) OH!
THAT SMELLS LIKE SULFUR.

02:36.333 --> 02:38.667
(knock on door)
(Meredith) BREAKFAST.

02:38.700 --> 02:41.400
OH, IT'S BREAKFAST.
(groans)

02:41.433 --> 02:42.600
NO!
OW!

02:42.633 --> 02:45.233
DON'T GO. DON'T GO.
I HAVE TO GO.

02:45.267 --> 02:47.200
SHE MADE BREAKFAST.
I'M GOING. NOW STOP.

02:47.233 --> 02:49.833
(laughs) OFF.
(grunts)

02:49.867 --> 02:52.767
OH!
OH.

02:52.800 --> 02:54.800
HEY.

02:54.833 --> 02:56.200
WHERE'S YOUR GIRLFRIEND?

02:56.233 --> 02:58.567
BACK WITH HER HUSBAND,
I'M GUESSING.

02:58.600 --> 03:00.733
AND I DON'T HAVE
A GIRLFRIEND.
OR A CONSCIENCE, APPARENTLY.

03:00.767 --> 03:03.167
YEAH, BUT YOU KNEW THAT
GOING IN.

03:03.200 --> 03:05.567
I'M NOT SAYING
WE HAVE TO BUILD IT NOW,

03:05.600 --> 03:08.200
BUT WE HAVE TO PLAN IT NOW.
DUDE, WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

03:08.233 --> 03:11.100
MEREDITH COOKED. SHE WANTED
TO DO SOMETHING NICE FOR LEXIE.
YOU COOKED FOR ME?

03:11.133 --> 03:13.100
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.
JUST EGGS AND AVOCADO

03:13.133 --> 03:16.200
AND WHATEVER CHEESE
THAT WAS IN THE FRIDGE.

03:16.233 --> 03:19.267
OH, I LOVE, UM, AVOCADOS.

03:19.300 --> 03:21.667
IS IT OKAY?

03:21.700 --> 03:23.667
MM. MM-HMM.

03:28.633 --> 03:31.500
OKAY, HONEY. OKAY.

03:31.533 --> 03:34.667
THIS LITTLE MAN HAS BEEN FED
AND CHANGED.

03:34.700 --> 03:36.467
THERE WE GO.

03:36.500 --> 03:40.433
OH, I PUT THE BUILDING MANAGER'S
NUMBER ON MY DESK.

03:42.233 --> 03:43.633
THAT HE CAN FIX THE SINK.

03:43.667 --> 03:45.833
REMIND HIM HE IS THE ONE
THAT BROKE IT

03:45.867 --> 03:47.767
WHEN HE TRIED
TO FIX THE PIPES.

03:47.800 --> 03:49.433
(sighs)

03:49.467 --> 03:51.700
(Tuck babbles)

03:53.167 --> 03:54.100
OKAY.

03:54.133 --> 03:54.900
MIRANDA.

03:54.933 --> 03:56.533
OH, OH, YOU'RE TALKING
TO ME NOW?

03:56.567 --> 04:00.367
NOW THAT I'M MY WAY
OUT THE DOOR?
YOU'RE ALWAYS
ON YOUR WAY OUT THE DOOR.

04:00.400 --> 04:03.267
TUCKER--
NO, ARE YOU INTERESTED IN BEING
A PART OF THIS FAMILY OR NOT?

04:03.300 --> 04:05.200
BECAUSE--
OKAY,
I CAN'T DO THIS, UH, NOW.

04:05.233 --> 04:08.067
I-I DON'T HAVE TIME.
(Tuck cries)

04:08.100 --> 04:09.600
(elevator bell dings)

04:09.633 --> 04:11.333
OH, DR. TORRES.

04:11.367 --> 04:13.267
DR. HAHN, ANYONE WHO CAN
OUTDRINK ME

04:13.300 --> 04:15.200
AND STILL KICK MY ASS
AT THE DARTBOARD

04:15.233 --> 04:17.400
GETS TO CALL ME CALLIE.

04:17.433 --> 04:19.567
LAST NIGHT
WAS ACTUALLY FUN, WASN'T IT?

04:19.600 --> 04:20.833
(laughing) MM-HMM.

04:20.867 --> 04:22.767
AND I'M NOT A GROUP PERSON.
MM, ME NEITHER.

04:22.800 --> 04:26.067
I THINK IT'S BECAUSE I
GENERALLY DON'T LIKE PEOPLE.

04:26.100 --> 04:27.467
ME NEITHER. (laughs)

04:27.500 --> 04:29.367
(ding)

04:29.400 --> 04:31.367
MORNING, LADIES.

04:31.400 --> 04:33.833
CASE IN POINT. (laughs)
(laughs)

04:33.867 --> 04:36.367
(Callie and Erica laugh)

04:38.633 --> 04:40.500
WHAT'S SO FUNNY?

04:40.533 --> 04:42.433
AND WHEN MAN FINDS HIMSELF
IN TROUBLE,

04:42.467 --> 04:44.367
WHICH IS MOST OF THE TIME,

04:44.400 --> 04:47.200
HE TURNS TO SOMETHING BIGGER
THAN HIMSELF--

04:47.233 --> 04:50.100
TO LOVE OR FATE OR RELIGION--
TO MAKE SENSE OF IT ALL.

04:50.133 --> 04:52.033
SWEET TART?
DO YOU EVER EAT ANYTHING

04:52.067 --> 04:54.133
THAT EVEN REMOTELY RESEMBLES
REAL FOOD?

04:54.167 --> 04:56.600
YOU'LL HAVE TO TAKE ME
TO DINNER TO FIND OUT.
I CAN'T DO THAT.

04:56.633 --> 04:58.333
THAT, UH, KISS WAS...

04:58.367 --> 04:59.733
UNEXPECTED.

04:59.767 --> 05:02.500
I LIKE KISSING YOU.

05:02.533 --> 05:04.833
I ENJOYED KISSING YOU,
BUT, UH, I'M SEEING SOMEBODY.

05:04.867 --> 05:06.533
MEREDITH GREY.

05:06.567 --> 05:09.167
EVERYBODY KNOWS ABOUT YOU
AND MEREDITH GREY.
OH.

05:09.200 --> 05:11.600
I HAVE TO SEE IT THROUGH.
I'M SORRY.

05:11.633 --> 05:14.100
DON'T BE.
IT WAS JUST A KISS.

05:14.133 --> 05:16.167
SEE YOU IN SURGERY,
DR. SHEPHERD.
MM-HMM.

05:16.200 --> 05:17.233
BUT FOR A SURGEON,

05:17.267 --> 05:21.167
THE ONLY THING THAT MAKES
ANY KIND OF SENSE IS...

05:21.200 --> 05:22.667
MEDICINE.

05:22.700 --> 05:24.600
YES.

05:24.633 --> 05:26.733
OH, I--BACK OFF.
ELIZABETH ARCHER IS MY PATIENT.

05:26.767 --> 05:29.567
TECHNICALLY, SHE'S HAHN'S
PATIENT, BUT WHATEVER.

05:29.600 --> 05:31.500
OOH. UM, I'M SCRUBBING IN

05:31.533 --> 05:33.800
ON A MAJOR CORONARY ARTERY
DISSECTION WITH HAHN,

05:33.833 --> 05:36.433
AND WHAT, YOU'RE NOT
GONNA FIGHT ME FOR IT?

05:36.467 --> 05:38.267
I'M NOT DOING
THE CARDIO THING ANYMORE.

05:38.300 --> 05:40.200
I AM OVER IT.

05:40.233 --> 05:41.533
YOU'RE OVER IT?

05:41.567 --> 05:44.167
WHOA, WHOA. UH, WHY?
WHAT DO YOU HAVE?

05:44.200 --> 05:48.067
NOTHING. I'M CHARTING.
STEVENS,
ELIZABETH'S ARCHER'S CHART.

05:48.100 --> 05:50.667
YANG HAS IT.
YOU TWO HAVE FUN.
SHE'S NOT
A CARDIOTHORACIC SURGEON,

05:50.700 --> 05:54.800
BUT I COULD'VE TOLD YOU THAT.
I AM THE ROCK STAR.

05:56.367 --> 05:58.400
KAREV, ARE YOU A ROCK STAR?
ALWAYS.

05:58.433 --> 06:00.100
YOU'RE WITH ME TODAY.

06:00.133 --> 06:02.467
CONGRATULATIONS. YOUR LIFE
JUST GOT MORE INTERESTING.

06:04.567 --> 06:06.467
KAREV DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT ELIZABETH ARCHER.

06:06.500 --> 06:08.400
YOU CAN READ,
CAN'T YOU, DR. KAREV?

06:08.433 --> 06:10.100
UH, YES.

06:10.133 --> 06:12.033
ELIZABETH ARCHER, 49,
CAME INTO THE E.R. YESTERDAY

06:12.067 --> 06:13.233
COMPLAINING OF SEVERE,
PERSISTENT--

06:13.267 --> 06:15.167
AN URGENT CARDIAC CATH
DEMONSTRATED DISSECTION

06:15.200 --> 06:17.400
OF THE PROXIMAL TWO-THIRDS
OF THE L.A.D.

06:17.433 --> 06:20.567
SHE WAS ADMITTED LAST NIGHT
FOR OBSERVATION.
WHILE I ADMIRE
YOUR PREPARATION, DR. YANG,

06:20.600 --> 06:23.500
THERE IS ONE THING
ABOUT THE PATIENT

06:23.533 --> 06:25.167
YOU FAILED TO NOTICE.

06:25.200 --> 06:27.333
SHE'S GONE.

06:30.333 --> 06:32.100
CALLIE.

06:32.133 --> 06:34.267
MRS. O'MALLEY, HI.

06:34.300 --> 06:35.633
OH.
OH.

06:35.667 --> 06:37.500
(chuckles) HI.
HOW HAVE YOU BEEN?

06:37.533 --> 06:39.433
WELL, I'VE BEEN WORRIED
IS HOW I'VE BEEN.

06:39.467 --> 06:41.367
I--I'VE CALLED,
AND I LEFT MESSAGES.

06:41.400 --> 06:43.600
I KNOW HOW BUSY YOU TWO ARE,

06:43.633 --> 06:46.433
BUT YOU CAN'T PICK UP
THE PHONE ONCE IN A WHILE?
I... I--

06:46.467 --> 06:49.133
NEVER MIND.
WATER UNDER THE BRIDGE.

06:49.167 --> 06:51.300
I WAS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD,
AND I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND,

06:51.333 --> 06:53.167
BUT I JUST COULDN'T WAIT
TO SHOW YOU

06:53.200 --> 06:55.167
SOME OF THE OUTFITS
I'VE BEEN MAKING.
OUT-OUTFITS?

06:55.200 --> 06:58.367
NOW DON'T GET MAD, BUT GEORGIE
TOLD ME YOU WERE TRYING,

06:58.400 --> 06:59.800
SO... WHAT DO YOU THINK?

06:59.833 --> 07:02.233
IT'S YELLOW.

07:02.267 --> 07:05.300
I SEE THAT.

07:05.333 --> 07:07.567
DR. BAILEY.
WHATEVER IT IS,
I DON'T HAVE TIME.

07:07.600 --> 07:09.500
UM, I THINK I NEED
SOME EPINEPHRINE.

07:09.533 --> 07:12.567
(cell phone rings, beeps)

07:12.600 --> 07:15.767
TUCKER, NOW'S NOT
A GOOD TIME FOR--
(whispers) EPINEPHRINE?

07:15.800 --> 07:17.700
UH, THE CART'S
AROUND THE CORNER.

07:17.733 --> 07:19.333
CAN YOU GIVE HER THE...
YEAH.
THANK YOU.

07:19.367 --> 07:22.633
NO, I TOLD YOU,
I PUT IT ON MY DESK.
(alarm blares)

07:22.667 --> 07:24.833
UH, I HAVE TO CALL YOU BACK.

07:24.867 --> 07:27.600
(monitor beeping rapidly)

07:27.633 --> 07:30.533
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO STEP BACK
FROM THE PATIENT, MA'AM.

07:30.567 --> 07:32.733
(Miranda) MA'AM?

07:32.767 --> 07:34.733
JUST ONE SECOND.

07:34.767 --> 07:37.167
MS. ARCHER?
UH, WHAT IS SHE DOING HERE?
I HAVE NO IDEA. WHO IS SHE?

07:37.200 --> 07:39.067
SHE'S HAHN'S PATIENT.

07:39.100 --> 07:41.433
MS. ARCHER, UH, YOU NEED
TO GET BACK TO YOUR BED.

07:41.467 --> 07:43.833
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

07:43.867 --> 07:46.100
THERE.

07:47.800 --> 07:50.667
WHAT'D YOU DO TO HIM?
HE WAS IN V-TACH AND NOW...

07:50.700 --> 07:53.533
I-I HEALED HIM.
I'M A HEALER.

07:54.867 --> 07:57.033
OH!

08:03.567 --> 08:05.067
YOU'RE A FAITH HEALER?

08:05.100 --> 08:06.833
I'M A HEALER,
AND I HAVE FAITH,

08:06.867 --> 08:09.667
BUT I'M NOT SURE
THE TWO ARE RELATED.
(Erica) MS. ARCHER,
YOU COLLAPSED.

08:09.700 --> 08:12.533
YOU COULD GO INTO
CARDIAC ARREST AT ANY MOMENT.

08:12.567 --> 08:15.133
SO I'M LESS INTERESTED
IN WHAT YOU DO FOR A LIVING

08:15.167 --> 08:18.067
THAN I AM
WITH GETTING YOU INTO--
WELL, WAIT. I WANT TO KNOW
WHAT SHE DID TO MR. GREENWALD.

08:18.100 --> 08:20.433
I MEAN, HE'S BEEN IN AND OUT
OF V-TACH ALL DAY,

08:20.467 --> 08:24.067
AND NOW HE'S STABLE.
MAYBE BECAUSE OF THE AMIODARONE
HE GOT TWO HOURS AGO.

08:24.100 --> 08:25.167
REALLY?

08:25.200 --> 08:27.433
DOES AMIODARONE USUALLY TAKE
TWO HOURS TO KICK IN?

08:27.467 --> 08:31.200
MS. ARCHER, YOU HAVE
A CORONARY ARTERY DISSECTION.

08:31.233 --> 08:33.767
DR. KAREV AND I NEED TO
GET YOU INTO SURGERY

08:33.800 --> 08:35.567
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

08:35.600 --> 08:38.467
I APPRECIATE THAT, DR. HAHN,
BUT I AM NOT GOING INTO SURGERY

08:38.500 --> 08:40.533
UNTIL WE'VE EXHAUSTED
ALL THE OTHER POSSIBILITIES.

08:40.567 --> 08:43.467
MS. ARCHER, IF YOU DON'T HAVE
THE SURGERY SOON,

08:43.500 --> 08:46.133
I CAN GUARANTEE YOU THAT
THE BLOOD SUPPLY TO YOUR HEART

08:46.167 --> 08:47.333
WILL BE CUT OFF,

08:47.367 --> 08:49.500
AND I'LL HAVE TO
OPEN YOU UP ANYWAY.

08:49.533 --> 08:52.100
ALL I'M ASKING FOR
IS THAT YOU GIVE ME SOME TIME

08:52.133 --> 08:55.267
AND TALK ME THROUGH THE SURGERY
THAT YOU'D LIKE TO PERFORM

08:55.300 --> 08:58.167
SO THAT I MAY VISUALIZE IT
WHILE I DO WHAT I DO.

08:58.200 --> 09:01.067
AND IF IT DOESN'T WORK, THEN YOU
CAN SLICE ME OPEN, OKAY?

09:01.100 --> 09:03.767
DR. KAREV
CAN WORK WITH YOU

09:03.800 --> 09:06.633
DOING WHATEVER IT IS
THAT YOU DO.

09:06.667 --> 09:08.533
I'LL CHECK IN SOON.

09:08.567 --> 09:10.567
CALL ME WHEN SHE CODES.

09:14.833 --> 09:16.733
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU
LOOKING FOR?

09:16.767 --> 09:18.100
EPINEPHRINE.
I NEED EPINEPHRINE.

09:18.133 --> 09:19.600
WHY?

09:19.633 --> 09:21.067
OH, WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

09:21.100 --> 09:22.833
I'M AN ADULT CHILD
OF AN ALCOHOLIC

09:22.867 --> 09:25.100
IS WHAT HAPPENED TO ME.
I HAVE BOUNDARY ISSUES.

09:25.133 --> 09:26.600
SO WHEN MEREDITH
MADE ME EGGS THIS MORNING,

09:26.633 --> 09:28.533
I COULDN'T NOT EAT THEM.

09:28.567 --> 09:30.733
I HAD TO PRETEND I WASN'T
ALLERGIC TO EGGS.

09:30.767 --> 09:33.633
AND NOW I HAVE A RASH
COVERING MY ENTIRE BODY.
GIVE ME YOUR ARM.

09:33.667 --> 09:35.700
I'M CODEPENDENT,
MY THROAT IS CLOSING UP--

09:35.733 --> 09:39.800
OW--AND NOW MY ARM HURTS.
(gasps) THANKS.

09:39.833 --> 09:42.767
YOU'RE WELCOME.
AND THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME
CRASH ON YOUR COUCH LAST NIGHT.

09:42.800 --> 09:45.300
YOU DIDN'T TELL YOUR MOM
THAT WE BROKE UP?
WHAT?

09:45.333 --> 09:47.067
YOUR MOM IS MAKING US
BABY CLOTHES BECAUSE SHE THINKS

09:47.100 --> 09:48.633
WE'RE STILL TRYING
TO GET PREGNANT

09:48.667 --> 09:50.500
BECAUSE SHE THINKS
WE'RE STILL MARRIED

09:50.533 --> 09:52.433
BECAUSE SHE THINKS YOU'RE STILL
THE KIND OF PERSON

09:52.467 --> 09:54.433
WHO WOULD NEVER CHEAT
ON HIS WIFE--

09:54.467 --> 09:56.300
HAND-STITCHED
UNISEX BABY CLOTHES.

09:56.333 --> 09:59.133
THEY'RE YELLOW AND GREEN
AND GO UP TO TODDLER SIZES.

09:59.167 --> 10:02.333
AND SHE'S WAITING FOR YOU
IN THE LOBBY.

10:02.367 --> 10:03.833
HEY.
HEY.

10:03.867 --> 10:06.733
SO YOU NEVER REALLY TOLD ME
WHAT YOU THOUGHT OF THE HOUSE.

10:06.767 --> 10:07.833
I HAVE A HOUSE.

10:07.867 --> 10:10.600
WELL, THAT'S YOUR HOUSE.
I'M TALKING ABOUT OUR HOUSE.

10:10.633 --> 10:12.800
BETWEEN YESTERDAY AND TODAY
YOU HAD PLANS DRAWN UP?

10:12.833 --> 10:14.733
NO, I'VE HAD THE PLANS
FOR MONTHS.

10:14.767 --> 10:17.633
BETWEEN YESTERDAY AND TODAY, I
DECIDED TO SHARE THEM WITH YOU.

10:17.667 --> 10:20.500
WHY?
(sighs) SO NOTHING'S
REALLY CHANGED, HAS IT?

10:20.533 --> 10:22.733
EVERYTHING'S THE SAME
AS IT WAS.

10:22.767 --> 10:25.433
NO, IT'S JUST--IT'S REALLY
A LOT, AND IT'S FAST.

10:25.467 --> 10:28.167
RIGHT. WELL, I'M JUST TRYING
TO TAKE A STEP FORWARD.

10:28.200 --> 10:30.167
OKAY, WELL, THERE ARE ABOUT
100 STEPS

10:30.200 --> 10:32.833
BETWEEN WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW
AND BUILDING OUR DREAM HOUSE.

10:32.867 --> 10:34.567
AND THEY'LL BE FUN STEPS
AND SEXY STEPS,

10:34.600 --> 10:37.067
AND WE'LL TRY NOT TO
FALL DOWN THEM TOGETHER.

10:37.100 --> 10:38.467
OKAY?

10:38.500 --> 10:39.667
OKAY.

10:42.300 --> 10:43.633
(cell phone rings)

10:43.667 --> 10:45.167
DR. BAILEY.
UH, S--CHIEF.

10:45.200 --> 10:47.100
YEAH, RUMOR HAS IT
DR. HAHN HAS A PATIENT

10:47.133 --> 10:48.467
WHO'S WANDERING THE HALLS?

10:48.500 --> 10:50.400
OH, SHE'S BACK
IN HER BED, SIR.

10:50.433 --> 10:52.333
AND LAYING HANDS
ON OTHER PATIENTS?

10:52.367 --> 10:54.267
IT WAS JUST ONE PATIENT.

10:54.300 --> 10:56.200
AND HEALING THEM?
FOR WHICH THERE IS
A PERFECTLY REASONABLE

10:56.233 --> 10:58.133
MEDICAL EXPLANATION.
(cell phone ringing)

10:58.167 --> 11:00.067
OF COURSE THERE IS,
BUT I CAN'T HAVE

11:00.100 --> 11:01.700
A HOSPITAL
FULL OF SICK PEOPLE

11:01.733 --> 11:04.300
THINKING THERE'S A MIRACLE WOMAN
ON THE CARDIAC WARD.

11:04.333 --> 11:06.833
CREATES PANIC AND HYSTERIA,
AND FRANKLY,

11:06.867 --> 11:09.600
IT'S BAD FOR BUSINESS.
ARE YOU GONNA ANSWER THAT?
NO, SIR, I'M NOT.

11:09.633 --> 11:11.367
ARE YOU GONNA MAKE SURE
THIS WOMAN

11:11.400 --> 11:13.433
KEEPS HER HANDS TO HERSELF?
YES, SIR, I AM.

11:13.467 --> 11:15.100
THANK YOU, DR. BAILEY.

11:15.133 --> 11:16.067
(ringing stops)

11:16.100 --> 11:18.100
UH... (sighs)

11:19.267 --> 11:21.533
DR. SLOAN,

11:21.567 --> 11:23.767
WHY ARE YOU ENDANGERING
THE LIFE OF MY PATIENT?

11:23.800 --> 11:26.600
BECAUSE YOUR PATIENT
HAD HER HANDS ALL OVER

11:26.633 --> 11:28.367
ONE OF MY PATIENTS.

11:28.400 --> 11:30.533
SHE HAD A STAPH INFECTION.
I WAS TRYING TO HEAL HER.

11:30.567 --> 11:33.567
DON'T WORRY YOUR PRETTY LITTLE
HEAD ABOUT IT, SLOAN. KAREV.

11:33.600 --> 11:36.133
HAVE YOU NOTICED THAT
EVEN WHEN YOU'RE INSULTING ME,

11:36.167 --> 11:38.367
YOU MANAGE TO TELL ME
HOW PRETTY I AM?
IT WASN'T MEANT
AS A COMPLIMENT.

11:38.400 --> 11:40.300
IS THIS LIKE A GENDER REVERSAL
THING WITH YOU,

11:40.333 --> 11:42.167
WHERE YOU'RE
THE BIG MAN ON CAMPUS

11:42.200 --> 11:45.567
AND I'M THE HOT BLOND WHOSE
PONYTAIL YOU CAN'T STOP PULLING?

11:45.600 --> 11:48.033
WHY DON'T YOU GET
THAT I JUST DON'T LIKE YOU,

11:48.067 --> 11:51.533
THAT I THINK YOU ARE A CRASS,
PREDATORY APE OF MAN

11:51.567 --> 11:53.467
WHO JUST HAPPENS TO BE
A DECENT SURGEON?

11:53.500 --> 11:56.200
YOU WANT TO HEAL SOMEONE?
HEAL HER.
THIS IS
REALLY TOXIC IN HERE.

11:56.233 --> 11:58.600
COULD SOMEBODY
TAKE ME BACK TO MY ROOM?

11:58.633 --> 12:02.167
'CAUSE MY HEALING TEAM
SHOULD BE ARRIVING SOON.
I'LL TAKE YOU.

12:02.200 --> 12:04.167
(Izzie) MRS. O'MALLEY.
THERE SHE IS.

12:04.200 --> 12:05.667
HI!
COME HERE.

12:05.700 --> 12:08.300
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
DOES GEORGE KNOW YOU'RE HERE?

12:08.333 --> 12:10.233
CALLIE SAID
SHE'D FIND HIM FOR ME.

12:10.267 --> 12:12.500
HOW ARE YOU, DEAR?
YOU OKAY?

12:12.533 --> 12:14.200
YOU TALKED TO CALLIE?
POOR THING.

12:14.233 --> 12:16.333
IT'S GOTTA BE HARD FOR HER,
YOU KNOW?

12:16.367 --> 12:19.700
I MEAN, YOU TRY AND YOU TRY,
BUT WE'RE ALL HUMAN.

12:19.733 --> 12:21.233
NOBODY'S PERFECT.

12:21.267 --> 12:24.200
AND IN THE END,
IT'S NOBODY'S FAULT.
I'M SO HAPPY
TO HEAR YOU SAY THAT.

12:24.233 --> 12:26.133
I HAVE JUST FELT
SO TERRIBLE ABOUT IT.

12:26.167 --> 12:27.500
OH, I KNOW. ME, TOO.

12:27.533 --> 12:29.133
YOU KNOW, WE JUST...

12:29.167 --> 12:31.067
WE DIDN'T MEAN
FOR IT TO HAPPEN.

12:31.100 --> 12:33.100
I KNOW HOW THAT SOUNDS,
BUT IT'S TRUE.

12:33.133 --> 12:34.567
WE WERE...

12:34.600 --> 12:36.833
WE WERE DRUNK, AND IT
ONLY HAPPENED THE ONE TIME.

12:36.867 --> 12:39.433
AND I KNOW THAT DOESN'T
MAKE IT RIGHT.

12:39.467 --> 12:42.233
BUT YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE ME,
IT WAS NEVER MY INTENTION

12:42.267 --> 12:43.433
TO BREAK UP
GEORGE'S MARRIAGE.

12:43.467 --> 12:46.733
I-I MEAN, I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
THAT I WAS IN LOVE WITH HIM.

12:46.767 --> 12:48.667
AND GEORGE WAS SO DISTRAUGHT
ABOUT IT.

12:48.700 --> 12:51.800
I MEAN, I THINK THAT'S WHY
HE FAILED THE INTERN TEST.
HE WH-WHAT? HE FAILED?

12:51.833 --> 12:54.400
OH, NO. HE DIDN'T
TELL YOU THAT PART?
HE DIDN'T TELL ME ANY PART.

12:54.433 --> 12:57.300
BUT YOU SAID YOU--
YOU TALKED TO CALLIE.
ABOUT BABY CLOTHES.

12:57.333 --> 12:59.600
I THOUGHT SHE WAS HAVING
TROUBLE GETTING PREGNANT.

12:59.633 --> 13:02.133
I MADE BABY CLOTHES.
OH.

13:02.167 --> 13:03.600
OH, NO.

13:03.633 --> 13:06.533
MOM.

13:06.567 --> 13:08.600
WHAT?
I'M SORRY.

13:08.633 --> 13:11.100
I'M SO SORRY. I'M SORRY,
I'M SORRY, I'M SORRY.

13:11.133 --> 13:12.467
I'M SORRY.

13:12.500 --> 13:13.800
(cell phone rings)

13:13.833 --> 13:16.300
HEY, I-I KNOW I SAID
I'D CALL YOU RIGHT BACK...

13:16.333 --> 13:18.233
TUCKER, WAIT,
I CAN'T DO THIS RIGHT NOW.

13:18.267 --> 13:20.200
I'M BEING PAGED TO THE E.R.

13:20.233 --> 13:22.533
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
YOU'RE THE ONE PAGING ME?

13:22.567 --> 13:25.467
I-I TOLD YOU NEVER TO PAGE ME
AT THE HOSPITAL UNLESS...

13:25.500 --> 13:28.367
(crying)

13:28.400 --> 13:30.600
(siren wailing)

13:30.633 --> 13:34.700
(crying continues)

13:36.233 --> 13:37.600
THERE WAS AN ACCIDENT.

13:43.300 --> 13:45.300
(crying)
ALL FOUR LIMBS ARE MOVING.

13:45.333 --> 13:47.033
PUPILS ARE RESPONSIVE
AND DILATING.

13:47.067 --> 13:48.467
THERE'S NO
NEUROLOGICAL DAMAGE.

13:48.500 --> 13:50.167
LET'S GET HIM ON A MONITOR.

13:50.200 --> 13:53.067
AND WHERE'S THE X-RAY
FOR THE TRAUMA SERIES?
ORDER A LEFT FOREARM
WITH THE X-RAYS.

13:53.100 --> 13:55.500
THERE'S BRUISING
AND SWELLING HERE.
MAMA'S RIGHT HERE.
LITTLE MAN.

13:55.533 --> 13:57.433
I'M RIGHT HERE.
(Richard) HE WAS UNDER
A BOOKSHELF?

13:57.467 --> 13:59.500
THE WHOLE THING MUST HAVE
FALLEN OVER ON TOP OF HIM.

13:59.533 --> 14:01.467
AND ALL THOSE MEDICAL BOOKS--

14:01.500 --> 14:03.367
HE PROBABLY TRIED TO CLIMB UP
AND PULLED IT OVER.
SHH.

14:03.400 --> 14:05.567
I HEARD HIM SCREAMING,
AND THEN I FOUND HIM.

14:05.600 --> 14:07.667
TUCKER, I'M TRYING TO HEAR.
STOP TALKING.

14:07.700 --> 14:11.033
MIRANDA, LET ME DO THAT.
NO, NO, I GOT IT.
I GOT IT.

14:11.067 --> 14:12.800
MIRANDA.
WHAT? I-I...

14:12.833 --> 14:16.667
THIS IS WHY WE PUT THE BABY GATE
IN THE LIVING ROOM.
THE GATE WAS OPEN.

14:16.700 --> 14:18.133
YOU LEFT THE GATE OPEN?
NO, I DIDN'T.

14:18.167 --> 14:20.700
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY,
I LEFT THE GATE OPEN?
ACCIDENTS HAPPEN.

14:20.733 --> 14:23.433
NOT IF YOU TAKE THE TIME TO BOLT
THE BOOKSHELVES TO THE WALL.

14:23.467 --> 14:25.467
I CAN'T BABY-PROOF EVERY INCH
OF THAT APARTMENT

14:25.500 --> 14:28.300
AND WATCH HIM
AT THE SAME TIME.
WELL, YOU WEREN'T WATCHING HIM,

14:28.333 --> 14:30.433
OTHERWISE WE WOULDN'T
BE HERE RIGHT NOW.
OKAY, HE'S GOT
DECREASED BREATH SOUNDS

14:30.467 --> 14:33.100
ON THE LEFT SIDE,
AND HIS ABDOMEN'S RIGID.

14:33.133 --> 14:35.333
WHAT DOES ALL THIS MEAN?
IT MEANS THERE MAY BE
SOME INTERNAL INJURIES.

14:35.367 --> 14:38.467
WHAT KIND OF INJURIES?
TUCKER, WE DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR QUESTIONS.

14:38.500 --> 14:40.367
HE NEEDS A FULL TRAUMA WORKUP.

14:40.400 --> 14:42.667
CLEAR A C.T. AND GET ME
AN ULTRASOUND MACHINE.

14:42.700 --> 14:44.067
(Tuck cries)

14:44.100 --> 14:46.500
THIS IS NOT OKAY, GEORGIE.
THIS IS NOT OKAY.

14:46.533 --> 14:48.800
I-I--
YOU'RE PLANNING TO WHAT? YOU'RE
PLANNING TO MARRY IZZIE NOW?

14:48.833 --> 14:51.033
YOU'RE PLANNING AN ANNULMENT?
OKAY, THIS--
THIS IS NOT ABOUT IZZIE.

14:51.067 --> 14:53.600
WHAT THE HELL IS IT ABOUT?
BECAUSE THIS ISN'T OKAY.

14:53.633 --> 14:55.667
THIS ISN'T OKAY WITH ME.
I RAISED YOU BETTER THAN THIS.

14:55.700 --> 14:58.033
THIS IS ABOUT THE FACT THAT
I NEVER SHOULD'VE GOTTEN MARRIED

14:58.067 --> 15:01.300
IN THE FIRST PLACE.
BUT YOU DID. YOU GOT MARRIED.
YOU DIDN'T INVITE ME.

15:01.333 --> 15:04.600
YOU DIDN'T LET ME PLAN
A WEDDING, AND I ACCEPTED THAT.

15:04.633 --> 15:06.600
I ACCEPTED IT
BECAUSE YOU WERE HAPPY,

15:06.633 --> 15:08.533
AND THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERED,
BUT THIS--

15:08.567 --> 15:10.833
I WON'T ACCEPT THIS.
I DON'T ACCEPT THIS.
MOM.

15:10.867 --> 15:12.767
WE'RE CATHOLIC.
WE DON'T BELIEVE IN DIVORCE.

15:12.800 --> 15:15.400
AND WE CERTAINLY
DON'T BELIEVE IN ADULTERY.
I'M SORRY.

15:15.433 --> 15:18.200
WELL, DON'T BE SORRY TO ME.
BE SORRY TO FATHER MIKE.

15:18.233 --> 15:20.133
YOU CALL HIM,
HE'LL HEAR YOUR CONFESSION

15:20.167 --> 15:23.033
AND HE'LL GET YOU AND CALLIE
INTO COUNSELING.
IT'S TOO LATE FOR THAT.

15:23.067 --> 15:24.433
IT IS NOT TOO LATE.

15:24.467 --> 15:27.200
YOU MADE A VOW TO CALLIE
AND A VOW TO GOD.

15:27.233 --> 15:29.633
(pager beeping)
YOU JUST DON'T WALK AWAY
FROM THAT.

15:29.667 --> 15:32.567
THIS IS YOUR SOUL
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.
I HAVE TO GO.

15:32.600 --> 15:33.800
NO, YOU WILL NOT.

15:33.833 --> 15:36.367
YOU WILL NOT WALK AWAY FROM ME,
GEORGE O'MALLEY.

15:36.400 --> 15:39.367
IT'S DR. BAILEY.
I HAVE TO GO.

15:39.400 --> 15:42.400
(Tuck crying)

15:44.367 --> 15:47.200
WHAT HAPPENED?
HE GOT CRUSHED
UNDER A BOOKSHELF.

15:47.233 --> 15:49.300
MULTIPLE RIB FRACTURES.
MIGHT HAVE DROPPED A LUNG.

15:49.333 --> 15:52.567
THEY'RE WORRIED THERE MAY BE
DAMAGE TO THE HEART.

15:52.600 --> 15:54.500
OKAY, YANG AND STEVENS,
GET HIM TO RADIOLOGY

15:54.533 --> 15:56.067
FOR A HEAD, CHEST
AND ABDOMINAL C.T.

15:56.100 --> 15:58.467
O'MALLEY, TELL THE LAB
TO MOVE FAST.

15:58.500 --> 16:00.400
KAREV, CLEAR OUT.
WE'LL KEEP YOU POSTED.

16:00.433 --> 16:02.333
I WANT YOU TO STAY
WITH DR. BAILEY.

16:02.367 --> 16:05.200
SHE'S PRETTY WORKED UP,
AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE

16:05.233 --> 16:08.133
THAT DOESN'T GET IN THE WAY
OF THE BABY'S CARE.
I DON'T NEED A BABYSITTER.

16:08.167 --> 16:10.033
I KNOW YOU DON'T.
(whispers) YOU STAY WITH HER.

16:10.067 --> 16:12.133
(footsteps approach)

16:14.167 --> 16:15.600
(clears throat)

16:15.633 --> 16:18.533
I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.
UH, THERE WAS AN EMERGENCY.

16:18.567 --> 16:21.100
DR. KAREV,
THIS IS DON AND MAI.

16:21.133 --> 16:23.433
NICE TO MEET YOU.
HE'S A SKEPTIC.
HE SHOULDN'T BE HERE.

16:23.467 --> 16:26.300
IS DR. HAHN COMING?
DR. HAHN'S BEEN CALLED
INTO AN EMERGENCY SURGERY,

16:26.333 --> 16:29.200
SO SHE ASKED ME TO TALK YOU
THROUGH THE PROCEDURE.
IS SHE GONNA BE LONG?

16:29.233 --> 16:32.100
WELL, I'M HOPING SHE'S DONE
BEFORE YOUR HEART BLOWS,

16:32.133 --> 16:34.367
BUT I CAN'T MAKE
ANY PROMISES.
I TOLD YOU
HE SHOULDN'T BE HERE.

16:34.400 --> 16:36.533
I NEED SOMEONE WHO KNOWS
WHAT THEY'RE DOING

16:36.567 --> 16:38.300
TO TALK ME THROUGH
THE SURGERY.

16:38.333 --> 16:40.667
THIS...
THIS, IT'S--IT'S CRAP.

16:40.700 --> 16:43.533
YOU'RE STALLING.
YOU'RE--YOU'RE SCARED.

16:43.567 --> 16:46.433
OF COURSE I'M SCARED.
SURGERY IS... IT'S BARBARIC.

16:46.467 --> 16:48.800
YOU TEAR FLESH
AND SPILL BLOOD.

16:48.833 --> 16:50.667
I-I WORK WITH LIGHT.

16:50.700 --> 16:52.633
I WORK WITH ENERGY.
I VISUALIZE HEALING.

16:52.667 --> 16:54.267
AND IF THERE'S EVEN

16:54.300 --> 16:57.233
THE SLIGHTEST CHANCE
THAT WHAT I DO WORKS,

16:57.267 --> 16:59.833
ISN'T THAT PREFERABLE?
I DON'T BELIEVE
IN WHAT YOU DO.

16:59.867 --> 17:01.667
WELL, I'M NOT ASKING YOU TO.

17:01.700 --> 17:04.633
I'M ASKING YOU
TO HELP ME TO DO IT.

17:04.667 --> 17:06.800
CAN YOU IMAGINE HOW HORRIBLE
THIS IS FOR HER?

17:06.833 --> 17:08.733
THIS IS WHY PEOPLE
SHOULD NOT HAVE KIDS.

17:08.767 --> 17:11.500
WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU?
THAT'S BAILEY'S BABY IN THERE.

17:11.533 --> 17:13.300
NO, SEE, NO.
IT'S A TRAUMA CASE.

17:13.333 --> 17:14.667
IF WE ARE GONNA BE

17:14.700 --> 17:16.600
AT ALL EFFECTIVE
IN SAVING THAT KID'S LIFE,

17:16.633 --> 17:18.167
IT CAN'T BE BAILEY'S BABY.

17:18.200 --> 17:20.333
HE'S A BLUNT TRAUMA CASE.
(scoffs)

17:20.367 --> 17:22.267
(Izzie) YOU AND HAHN
ARE EXACTLY ALIKE.

17:22.300 --> 17:24.300
THE TWO OF YOU
DESERVE EACH OTHER.
THANK YOU.

17:24.333 --> 17:26.100
I THOUGHT YOU LOVED CARDIO.
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO.

17:26.133 --> 17:28.133
SHE'S PRETENDING
NOT TO ANYMORE.

17:28.167 --> 17:30.067
CAN'T TAKE THE PRESSURE,
HUH, IZ?

17:30.100 --> 17:31.567
YOU'RE RIGHT, CRISTINA.

17:31.600 --> 17:34.100
IN THE CONTEST TO SEE WHO CAN BE
THE BEST ROBOT, YOU WIN.

17:34.133 --> 17:36.033
OOH. OOH, OOH, OOH, OOH.

17:36.067 --> 17:38.033
(machine clicks)

17:38.067 --> 17:41.333
(whirring)

17:44.667 --> 17:46.333
TELL ME AGAIN
HOW THIS HAPPENED.

17:46.367 --> 17:48.267
YOU DIDN'T UNDERSTAND ME
THE FIRST TIME?

17:48.300 --> 17:49.767
JUST--JUST TELL ME AGAIN.

17:49.800 --> 17:52.200
SOMEBODY LEFT
THE BABY GATE OPEN.

17:52.233 --> 17:53.700
SOMEBODY. AND YOU...

17:53.733 --> 17:56.467
YOU'RE--YOU'RE SAYING
YOU THINK I DID THIS?

17:56.500 --> 17:58.533
I'M SAYING THAT
YOU WERE IN SUCH A HURRY

17:58.567 --> 18:00.467
TO GET OUT THE HOUSE
THIS MORNING,

18:00.500 --> 18:03.267
THAT YOU WERE IN SUCH A HURRY
TO--TO GET TO WORK

18:03.300 --> 18:06.600
AND GET AWAY FROM ME--
OH, TUCKER, THIS DOESN'T HAVE
ANYTHING TO DO WITH--

18:06.633 --> 18:09.067
WHY DO YOU THINK HE EVEN
WENT INTO THAT ROOM, HUH?

18:09.100 --> 18:11.033
YOU THE ONLY ONE
EVER GOES IN THERE.

18:11.067 --> 18:13.733
HE WENT LOOKING
FOR HIS MAMA.

18:13.767 --> 18:17.767
HE WENT LOOKING FOR HIS MAMA
AND WOUND UP IN THE HOSPITAL.

18:22.167 --> 18:24.733
GUESS YOU MADE
A BAD CHOICE, HUH, TUCKER?

18:24.767 --> 18:27.300
YOU PICKED A BAD WIFE,

18:27.333 --> 18:29.267
SHE MADE A BAD MOTHER,

18:29.300 --> 18:31.233
SHE MADE YOU STAY HOME,

18:31.267 --> 18:32.667
RAISE YOUR SON,

18:32.700 --> 18:34.833
AND THEN
SHE ALMOST KILLED HIM.

18:34.867 --> 18:37.267
POOR YOU, HUH?

18:43.533 --> 18:46.433
I HEARD ABOUT DR. BAILEY'S SON.
HOW BAD IS IT?

18:46.467 --> 18:49.333
WELL, WE'RE STILL WAITING
ON HIS STUDIES.

18:49.367 --> 18:51.267
DEREK?
HMM?

18:51.300 --> 18:53.200
REMEMBER BEFORE WHEN I WAS
UNBELIEVABLY COOL

18:53.233 --> 18:55.367
AND LET YOU OFF THE HOOK
FOR MAKING OUT WITH ME?

18:55.400 --> 18:57.133
WELL, NOW I'M ANGRY.
WHY?

18:57.167 --> 18:59.300
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT MAKING
EYE CONTACT WITH ME.

18:59.333 --> 19:02.700
BECAUSE WE ARE STANDING HERE
TALKING ABOUT BAILEY'S BABY,

19:02.733 --> 19:04.800
AND YOU WON'T LOOK AT ME.

19:04.833 --> 19:06.567
SORRY.
BETTER.

19:06.600 --> 19:09.433
NOW IT WAS ONE KISS, OKAY?

19:09.467 --> 19:12.100
IT WAS A GOOD KISS,
MAYBE EVEN A GREAT ONE,

19:12.133 --> 19:14.300
BUT ARE WE GOING TO LET
ONE MAYBE-GREAT KISS

19:14.333 --> 19:16.233
GET IN THE WAY OF WHAT,
UP UNTIL NOW,

19:16.267 --> 19:18.167
HAS BEEN A REALLY GREAT
PROFESSIONAL RELATIONSHIP

19:18.200 --> 19:20.300
EVEN THOUGH YOU DIDN'T KNOW
MY NAME UNTIL RECENTLY?

19:20.333 --> 19:22.233
NO, WE ARE NOT.

19:22.267 --> 19:24.133
SO... FRIENDS?

19:24.167 --> 19:26.333
FRIENDS.

19:26.367 --> 19:28.400
GOOD.

19:30.667 --> 19:33.167
BAILEY WANTS TO KNOW
IF TUCK'S FILMS ARE READY.

19:33.200 --> 19:36.333
WHAT... IS THAT?
WHAT'S THAT SHADOW?

19:36.367 --> 19:38.567
WHERE'S HIS HEART?
YOU CAN'T SEE IT BECAUSE--

19:38.600 --> 19:41.333
HIS STOMACH'S IN HIS CHEST.
THERE'S
VISCERAL HERNIATION,

19:41.367 --> 19:44.300
A POSITIVE COLLAR SIGN.
(Miranda) WHICH INDICATES
A DIAPHRAGMATIC HERNIA.

19:44.333 --> 19:46.500
IT'S A RUPTURED DIAPHRAGM,

19:46.533 --> 19:48.800
WHICH IS THE LEAST
OF HIS PROBLEMS,

19:48.833 --> 19:50.733
'CAUSE THE FORCE
OF THE TRAUMA

19:50.767 --> 19:53.167
INJURED HIS THORACIC AORTA.

19:53.200 --> 19:55.733
YOU SEE THIS, IN THE CHEST
CAVITY NEXT TO THE STOMACH?

19:55.767 --> 19:57.467
THAT'S COLON.

19:57.500 --> 19:59.400
AND AROUND THE COLON IS FLUID,

19:59.433 --> 20:02.033
WHICH COULD MEAN
THE COLON IS RUPTURED

20:02.067 --> 20:03.800
AND THERE'S FECAL MATTER
FLOATING AROUND

20:03.833 --> 20:06.167
THAT COULD INFECT
THE AORTIC REPAIR,

20:06.200 --> 20:09.567
AND THAT COMPLICATION
CAN BE FATAL.

20:12.500 --> 20:14.633
WHAT ARE Y'ALL
STANDING AROUND FOR?

20:14.667 --> 20:17.700
UH, PAGE HAHN AND THE CHIEF.
BOOK AN O.R.

20:23.333 --> 20:24.800
OKAY, THEY REPAIRED
THE HOLE IN THE DIAPHRAGM,

20:24.833 --> 20:26.733
AND DR. HAHN IS JUST ABOUT
TO INSPECT THE MEDIASTINUM.

20:26.767 --> 20:30.267
OKAY, IS SHE GONNA REPAIR WITH
SUTURES OR PROSTHETIC GRAFT?

20:30.300 --> 20:32.200
DON'T KNOW.
DON'T KNOW?

20:32.233 --> 20:34.000
SHE DIDN'T SAY.

20:35.700 --> 20:37.067
DR. BAILEY.

20:37.100 --> 20:38.700
DR. BAILEY,
ARE YOU KIDDING?

20:38.733 --> 20:41.267
I NEED TO BE WITH MY SON.
MIRANDA--

20:41.300 --> 20:43.167
I HAVE NO INTENTION
OF GETTING IN THE WAY.

20:43.200 --> 20:45.500
I JUST--I CAN'T
STAND OUT THERE. I CAN'T.

20:45.533 --> 20:48.667
I NEED TO BE WITH MY SON.
AND WHAT WE NEED,
DR. BAILEY,

20:48.700 --> 20:50.600
IS TO NOT HAVE
OUR PATIENT'S MOTHER

20:50.633 --> 20:53.267
WATCHING US
PERFORM HIS SURGERY.

20:53.300 --> 20:57.167
DR. GREY, PLEASE ESCORT
DR. BAILEY BACK OUTSIDE.
NO.

20:57.200 --> 21:00.200
THERE WILL BE NO ESCORTING OF
DR. BAILEY ANYWHERE, DR. GREY.

21:00.233 --> 21:01.200
YOU CAN PROCEED.

21:01.233 --> 21:04.200
I WILL NOT PROCEED
UNTIL YOU LEAVE THIS O.R.

21:04.233 --> 21:06.733
NOW DO YOU WANT ME
TO STAND HERE TALKING TO YOU,

21:06.767 --> 21:11.633
OR DO YOU WANT ME TO TRY
AND SAVE YOUR BABY'S LIFE?

21:14.333 --> 21:17.300
MIRANDA.
I JUST WANT
TO HOLD MY SON'S HAND.

21:17.333 --> 21:19.467
I JUST WANT TO HOLD HIS HAND.
PLEASE.

21:19.500 --> 21:22.033
I'LL--I'LL HOLD HIS HAND.

21:22.067 --> 21:24.600
DR. GREY CAN HOLD
THIS RETRACTOR, RIGHT?

21:24.633 --> 21:25.833
YES.

21:25.867 --> 21:28.167
I'LL HOLD TUCK'S HAND,
DR. BAILEY,

21:28.200 --> 21:30.100
IF IT'S--
IF IT'S OKAY WITH YOU.

21:30.133 --> 21:33.100
I'LL HOLD--
I'LL HOLD HIS HAND.

21:38.433 --> 21:41.433
(stammering)

21:43.833 --> 21:47.233
OKAY, EVERYBODY,
LET'S GET BACK TO WORK.

21:58.867 --> 22:01.167
MRS. O'MALLEY.

22:01.200 --> 22:02.400
WHAT ARE YOU--

22:02.433 --> 22:04.067
I-I COULDN'T LEAVE.

22:04.100 --> 22:06.200
WHEN HAROLD WAS HERE,
WHEN HE WAS SICK,

22:06.233 --> 22:08.533
DR. BAILEY TOOK
SUCH GOOD CARE OF HIM.

22:08.567 --> 22:12.233
I COULDN'T LEAVE KNOWING
HER SON WAS IN TROUBLE,

22:12.267 --> 22:15.533
KNOWING BOTH OUR SONS
ARE IN TROUBLE.

22:15.567 --> 22:16.733
MRS. O'MALLEY, I JUST--

22:16.767 --> 22:20.533
LOOK... I KNOW YOU THINK
I'M OLD-FASHIONED,

22:20.567 --> 22:22.367
AND MAYBE I AM.

22:22.400 --> 22:25.500
BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT I THINK.

22:25.533 --> 22:27.667
IN GOD'S EYES,
MARRIAGE IS FOREVER.

22:27.700 --> 22:29.333
WELL, IF IT'S ANY CONSOLATION,

22:29.367 --> 22:31.833
GEORGE AND I GOT MARRIED
ON THE VEGAS STRIP

22:31.867 --> 22:34.200
AT A 24-HOUR CHURCH OF ELVIS.
(chuckles)

22:34.233 --> 22:37.533
I'M NOT SURE
GOD WAS EVEN THERE.
HE'S EVERYWHERE.

22:40.767 --> 22:43.033
I USED TO BELIEVE IN GOD...

22:43.067 --> 22:45.500
AND MARRIAGE...

22:45.533 --> 22:47.633
AND HEAVEN AND HELL.

22:47.667 --> 22:50.667
BUT YOU DON'T ANYMORE?

22:54.867 --> 22:58.300
I BELIEVE IN LOVE...

22:58.333 --> 23:01.133
AND SECOND CHANCES...

23:01.167 --> 23:04.033
AND THAT EVEN THOUGH
GEORGE WASN'T THE ONE FOR ME,

23:04.067 --> 23:06.600
IT... IT WAS OKAY
THAT I BELIEVED THAT HE WAS

23:06.633 --> 23:08.533
BECAUSE...

23:08.567 --> 23:11.533
WELL, FOR A LITTLE WHILE,
AT LEAST...

23:11.567 --> 23:14.433
I GOT TO BE AN O'MALLEY.

23:18.433 --> 23:21.633
AND I REALLY LOVED
BEING AN O'MALLEY.

23:28.100 --> 23:29.667
HE'S BACK.

23:29.700 --> 23:32.133
I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT,
BUT YOUR, UH, MOST RECENT ECHO

23:32.167 --> 23:34.400
SHOWS THE DISSECTION
IS EXTENDING.

23:34.433 --> 23:37.300
YOU NEED TO LET ME
PREP YOU FOR SURGERY.

23:37.333 --> 23:39.600
OH, NO. NO, NOT YET.
WE HAVEN'T FINISHED OUR WORK.

23:39.633 --> 23:41.467
YOU'RE GONNA DIE.

23:41.500 --> 23:43.400
DO YOU KNOW HOW MAI KNEW
YOU WERE BACK,

23:43.433 --> 23:45.167
EVEN WITH HER EYES CLOSED?

23:45.200 --> 23:47.100
UH, SHE HEARD ME?
SHE FELT YOU.

23:47.133 --> 23:50.033
IT'S LIKE A--LIKE A PULL,
LIKE A DARKNESS.

23:50.067 --> 23:52.300
RIGHT, RIGHT. I'M--I'M
THE ANGEL OF DEATH. GOT IT.

23:52.333 --> 23:55.400
NO. YOU'RE NOT
THE ANGEL OF DEATH, DR. KAREV.

23:55.433 --> 23:58.300
YOU'RE--YOU'RE ACTUALLY
A VERY SWEET BOY.

23:58.333 --> 24:00.700
HE'S GOT A BEAUTIFUL HEART,
WOULDN'T YOU SAY, MAI?

24:00.733 --> 24:03.733
I WOULD, BUT HIS GUT
AND HIS THROAT...
THEY'RE BLOCKED.

24:03.767 --> 24:06.267
SECOND CHAKRA'S WORSE.

24:06.300 --> 24:07.800
SERIOUSLY?
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT CHAKRA?

24:07.833 --> 24:10.133
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HOW
YOU'VE GOT A DARKNESS

24:10.167 --> 24:12.600
AT YOUR THROAT CHAKRA,
WHERE YOUR VOICE SHOULD BE

24:12.633 --> 24:15.333
BECAUSE WHATEVER HAPPENED
TO YOU WAS SO, SO UGLY

24:15.367 --> 24:18.700
AND WENT ON FOR SO LONG
THAT YOU DON'T TALK ABOUT IT.

24:18.733 --> 24:20.100
YOU WERE HURT SO BADLY

24:20.133 --> 24:22.700
THAT SOMETIMES YOU WANT
TO HURT OTHER PEOPLE

24:22.733 --> 24:25.600
JUST TO--
JUST TO SPREAD IT AROUND.

24:25.633 --> 24:28.333
YOU WERE A GOOD BOY,
DR. KAREV,

24:28.367 --> 24:31.267
A GOOD, SWEET BOY,

24:31.300 --> 24:33.200
BUT YOU'RE NOT
A VERY GOOD MAN.

24:33.233 --> 24:36.200
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

24:37.333 --> 24:39.300
YOUR ARTERY IS SHREDDING.

24:39.333 --> 24:41.200
YOU NEED SURGERY.

24:41.233 --> 24:43.667
I'M NOT A VERY GOOD MAN,
BUT I DO TELL THE TRUTH.

24:43.700 --> 24:46.367
AND THE TRUTH IS, IF YOU DON'T
GET THIS SURGERY FAST,

24:46.400 --> 24:48.467
YOU'RE GONNA DIE.

24:48.500 --> 24:51.367
I LEFT IT ON THE DESK, I WENT
THROUGH THE OFFICE DOOR,

24:51.400 --> 24:53.133
AND I CLOSED THE GATE.

24:53.167 --> 24:55.067
I WALKED FROM THE BEDROOM
TO THE OFFICE.

24:55.100 --> 24:57.333
I WROTE A NOTE
TO THE BUILDING MANAGER.

24:57.367 --> 25:00.033
I LEFT IT ON THE DESK.
I WAS IN A HURRY,

25:00.067 --> 25:02.767
SO I LOOKED AT THE CLOCK
AND I WALKED OUT OF THE DOOR.

25:02.800 --> 25:05.100
I... THE GATE.
MIRANDA, THIS ISN'T HELPING.

25:05.133 --> 25:07.467
THE GATE WAS OPEN.
DID I CLOSE THE GATE?

25:07.500 --> 25:09.133
DAMN IT!
STOP THIS.
IT'S NOT HELPING.

25:09.167 --> 25:11.767
OKAY, LOOK, I WALKED OUT OF
THE BEDROOM INTO THE OFFICE,

25:11.800 --> 25:13.700
AND I WROTE A NOTE--
THIS ISN'T--
THIS ISN'T HELPING.

25:13.733 --> 25:16.267
(crying) I CAN'T REMEMBER.
STOP THIS.
THIS IS NOT HELPING.

25:16.300 --> 25:18.367
I CAN'T REMEMBER
IF I CLOSED THAT GATE.

25:18.400 --> 25:20.167
THAT'S MY BABY, THAT'S MY BABY,
AND I CAN'T REMEMBER

25:20.200 --> 25:22.100
IF CLOSED THE GATE.
IT DOESN'T MATTER.
IT DOES NOT MATTER.

25:22.133 --> 25:24.167
IT DOES MATTER! OKAY? IT MATTERS
BECAUSE I'M HIS MOTHER,

25:24.200 --> 25:25.800
AND I CAN'T
HAVE DONE THIS TO HIM.

25:25.833 --> 25:28.833
I CAN'T HAVE HURT HIM
THIS BADLY.
YOU DIDN'T DO THIS.
THINGS JUST HAPPEN.

25:28.867 --> 25:30.733
NO, THEY DON'T JUST HAPPEN.
THINGS DON'T JUST HAPPEN.

25:30.767 --> 25:33.100
PEOPLE MAKE DECISIONS.
PEOPLE PRIORITIZE.

25:33.133 --> 25:35.500
OKAY, THE WORLD
JUST DOESN'T HAPPEN!
SHH.

25:35.533 --> 25:38.467
OKAY, IT'S NOT ON GOD.
IT'S ON ME OR IT'S ON TUCKER!

25:38.500 --> 25:40.633
STOP IT! STOP. STOP.
IT'S ON ME!

25:40.667 --> 25:42.400
NO, STOP IT. STOP IT.

25:42.433 --> 25:44.333
(crying)

25:44.367 --> 25:47.100
JUST... JUST STOP IT.

25:47.133 --> 25:48.600
OH...

25:48.633 --> 25:51.767
YOU'RE A GOOD MOTHER.
TUCKER IS A GOOD FATHER.

25:51.800 --> 25:53.700
YOU LOVE YOUR BABY.

25:53.733 --> 25:56.600
PEOPLE MAKE MISTAKES.

25:56.633 --> 25:58.800
YOU DIDN'T DO THIS
TO YOUR SON,

25:58.833 --> 26:01.433
AND NEITHER DID YOUR HUSBAND.

26:01.467 --> 26:04.300
(crying continues)

26:08.200 --> 26:10.233
HE WANTS TO BUILD US
A HOUSE,

26:10.267 --> 26:13.067
WITH KIDS' BEDROOMS
AND FRENCH DOORS,

26:13.100 --> 26:15.533
AND THAT SCARES ME
TO DEATH.
WHY?

26:15.567 --> 26:17.467
JUST 'CAUSE OF
THE ROSE THING?

26:17.500 --> 26:18.667
WELL, THAT SHOULDN'T
SCARE YOU.

26:18.700 --> 26:20.367
IT WAS JUST ONE KISS.

26:20.400 --> 26:21.567
ONE KISS?

26:21.600 --> 26:23.500
YEAH, I W--I WASN'T
EAVESDROPPING.

26:23.533 --> 26:26.167
IT WASN'T LIKE THEY WERE
BEING SECRETIVE ABOUT IT.

26:26.200 --> 26:28.100
IT WAS JUST SOMETHING
THAT HAPPENED.

26:28.133 --> 26:30.033
NOW THAT YOU GUYS
ARE BACK TOGETHER,

26:30.067 --> 26:31.233
IT'S NOT HAPPENING ANYMORE,
SO...

26:31.267 --> 26:32.833
DEREK KISSED ROSE?

26:32.867 --> 26:35.433
YEAH, BUT YOU KNEW THAT...

26:35.467 --> 26:41.400
THAT I'M AN IDIOT.

26:44.633 --> 26:45.833
OKAY,
THE STOMACH'S REPAIRED.

26:45.867 --> 26:47.500
THERE'S NO
SPLENIC LACERATION.

26:47.533 --> 26:50.400
NOW ALL I HAVE TO DO
IS GET THE CHEST TUBE IN,

26:50.433 --> 26:51.667
AND WE'RE DONE.

26:51.700 --> 26:53.333
THAT'S GOOD, TUCK.

26:53.367 --> 26:55.533
THAT MEANS YOU'RE IN
BETTER SHAPE THAN WE THOUGHT.

26:55.567 --> 26:58.133
THAT MEANS YOU'RE ALMOST
OUTTA HERE.

26:58.167 --> 27:01.000
DR. YANG, WOULD YOU
LIKE TO DO THE HONORS?

27:02.167 --> 27:06.033
I CAN TRADE PLACES
WITH YOU IF YOU'D LIKE.

27:06.067 --> 27:10.033
UH, NO. I'M OKAY.
I'M OKAY HERE.

27:16.467 --> 27:18.367
IT WAS HIS STOMACH
THAT RUPTURED

27:18.400 --> 27:22.267
AND NOT HIS COLON.
BOTH OF WHICH WE REPAIRED,
SO THE SURGERY WAS A SUCCESS.

27:22.300 --> 27:25.100
HOWEVER, THERE IS A LOT
OF FLUID IN THE CHEST CAVITY,

27:25.133 --> 27:27.667
SO AT THIS POINT,
WE HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING

27:27.700 --> 27:29.800
WHETHER HE'LL BE ABLE
TO BREATHE ON HIS OWN

27:29.833 --> 27:31.300
ANYTIME SOON.
I KNOW THAT.

27:31.333 --> 27:33.400
YOU DON'T THINK
I KNOW THAT?

27:33.433 --> 27:36.100
UH, WE'LL BE MOVING HIM
TO THE PEDIATRIC I.C.U.

27:36.133 --> 27:37.533
WE'LL BE WATCHING HIM CLOSELY.

27:37.567 --> 27:40.733
CAN I SEE MY SON NOW?
ABSOLUTELY.

27:47.233 --> 27:50.167
UH, YOU'RE NEW HERE.
YOU DON'T KNOW ME.

27:50.200 --> 27:52.833
AND IF WHAT YOU DID TODAY
ENDS UP SAVING MY SON'S LIFE,

27:52.867 --> 27:55.067
I'LL THANK YOU FOR IT.

27:55.100 --> 27:57.833
BUT IF I NEVER HAVE TO
LOOK AT YOU AGAIN AFTER THAT,

27:57.867 --> 28:00.667
THAT'LL BE ALL RIGHT
WITH ME.

28:00.700 --> 28:04.600
***

28:10.633 --> 28:12.800
WE NEVER BAPTIZED HIM.

28:12.833 --> 28:14.367
WE KEPT PUTTING IT OFF,

28:14.400 --> 28:16.367
THINKING WE WERE GONNA
FIND TIME,

28:16.400 --> 28:18.133
AND--AND NOW...

28:18.167 --> 28:22.067
WE WILL FIND THE TIME.

28:22.100 --> 28:24.567
WHEN THIS IS OVER

28:24.600 --> 28:27.300
AND TUCK IS FINE...

28:27.333 --> 28:30.533
YOU AND I
ARE GONNA FIND TIME,

28:30.567 --> 28:33.800
AND WE ARE GONNA BAPTIZE
OUR BABY.

28:33.833 --> 28:37.000
***

28:53.433 --> 28:56.433
***

29:01.233 --> 29:03.400
HOW'S TUCK?

29:03.433 --> 29:06.633
OH, HE'S STILL NOT BREATHING
ON HIS OWN.

29:06.667 --> 29:09.200
YOU KNOW,
I WISH I COULD HELP,

29:09.233 --> 29:11.400
BUT I CAN'T THINK
OF ANYTHING I CAN DO.

29:11.433 --> 29:13.333
CRISTINA ALWAYS KNOWS
WHAT TO DO.

29:13.367 --> 29:15.300
WHAT'S YOUR DEAL
WITH HER?

29:15.333 --> 29:16.667
WITH YANG?

29:16.700 --> 29:19.067
NOTHING. THERE'S NO DEAL.
I DON'T...

29:19.100 --> 29:20.367
I'M CRIPPLED WITH ENVY.

29:20.400 --> 29:24.100
OF YANG? 'CAUSE SHE'S BETTER
AT CARDIO THAN YOU?

29:24.133 --> 29:26.367
SHE'S NOT BETTER THAN ME.

29:26.400 --> 29:29.033
SHE JUST...

29:29.067 --> 29:31.067
SHE KNOWS WHAT SHE WANTS.

29:31.100 --> 29:34.533
SHE HAS THIS FAITH
IN HER SKILL, IN HERSELF,

29:34.567 --> 29:36.133
IN HER FUTURE IN CARDIO.

29:36.167 --> 29:39.700
IT'S AN UNWAVERING FAITH.

29:39.733 --> 29:42.700
SHE KNOWS WHO SHE IS,
AND I WANT THAT.

29:42.733 --> 29:46.433
I WAS CHASING CARDIO
BECAUSE I WANT WHAT SHE HAS.

29:46.467 --> 29:48.167
SHE'S A ROBOT.

29:48.200 --> 29:52.167
NOT THE ROBOT PART.
THE--THE FAITH PART.

29:52.200 --> 29:54.567
I WANT THAT.

29:54.600 --> 29:58.533
***

30:07.267 --> 30:10.267
***

30:13.333 --> 30:16.400
THERE'S PROBABLY A THOUSAND
SCIENTIFIC REASONS

30:16.433 --> 30:20.667
WHY MR. GREENWALD'S HEART RATE
JUST SUDDENLY STABILIZED.

30:20.700 --> 30:22.167
WITHOUT QUESTION.

30:22.200 --> 30:25.300
AND WHY MRS. McCAFFREY'S
STAPH INFECTION

30:25.333 --> 30:27.767
JUST SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED.

30:27.800 --> 30:30.700
SLOAN'S PATIENT?
SHE'S FINE?

30:30.733 --> 30:33.033
I MEAN, DON'T GET ME WRONG,

30:33.067 --> 30:34.767
I HAVE FAITH.

30:34.800 --> 30:36.167
I DO.

30:36.200 --> 30:38.267
***

30:38.300 --> 30:41.033
BUT FAITH ISN'T MEDICINE.

30:41.067 --> 30:45.833
FAITH... CAN'T HEAL YOU.

30:45.867 --> 30:48.633
WELL, THAT MAY BE SO.

30:48.667 --> 30:51.800
BUT THEN AGAIN...

30:51.833 --> 30:53.633
IT CAN'T HURT.

30:53.667 --> 30:57.300
***

30:59.367 --> 31:00.533
HEY.
HEY.

31:00.567 --> 31:03.833
HOW'S TUCK?
HE'S INTUBATED, AND, UH,

31:03.867 --> 31:05.767
WE WON'T KNOW ANYTHING
FOR A FEW HOURS.

31:05.800 --> 31:08.133
HOW ARE YOU HOLDING UP?

31:08.167 --> 31:10.700
WHO'S ROSE?

31:10.733 --> 31:12.567
UM...

31:12.600 --> 31:15.033
ROSE IS
A CIRCULATING NURSE.

31:15.067 --> 31:17.233
I KISSED HER ONCE.
I'M SURE YOU KNOW THAT.

31:17.267 --> 31:19.167
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE ASKING ME.
WHEN?

31:19.200 --> 31:21.400
WHEN?
WHEN DID YOU KISS HER?

31:21.433 --> 31:23.533
YESTERDAY.
NOW ARE WE GONNA TALK--

31:23.567 --> 31:25.200
SO YESTERDAY YOU WERE
MAKING OUT WITH SCRUB NURSES,

31:25.233 --> 31:28.133
AND TODAY YOU'RE BUILDING
OUR DREAM HOUSE.
YESTERDAY WE WERE DATING
OTHER PEOPLE.

31:28.167 --> 31:30.333
THAT'S NOT THE POINT.
THAT IS THE POINT.

31:30.367 --> 31:32.700
I TOLD YOU
I WANTED TO MARRY YOU...

31:32.733 --> 31:35.167
THAT I WANTED TO BUILD A HOUSE
AND A LIFE WITH YOU,

31:35.200 --> 31:37.433
AND YOU WEREN'T READY.
AND ROSE IS?

31:37.467 --> 31:39.467
YOU DON'T WANT TO BUILD
A LIFE WITH ME.

31:39.500 --> 31:40.667
YOU WANT SOMEONE.

31:40.700 --> 31:44.433
YOU WANT SOMEONE WHO WANTS
THE SAME THINGS THAT YOU WANT.

31:44.467 --> 31:47.333
(sighs) I KNEW THE MINUTE
I SHOWED YOU THOSE PLANS

31:47.367 --> 31:50.467
THAT YOU'D FIND SOME REASON
TO WALK AWAY.
SO WHAT, YOU CALLED MY BLUFF?

31:50.500 --> 31:52.400
I DID BECAUSE I CAN'T
DO THIS ANYMORE.

31:52.433 --> 31:54.667
I CAN'T DO THE FIGHTING,
THE BACK AND FORTH. I CAN'T.

31:54.700 --> 31:58.067
ARE WE TOGETHER
OR ARE WE NOT?
WE WERE TOGETHER.
I WAS IN LOVE WITH YOU.

31:58.100 --> 32:00.567
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME
YOU WERE MARRIED.

32:00.600 --> 32:03.300
OKAY, SO NOW WE'RE GONNA HAVE
THAT FIGHT AGAIN.

32:03.333 --> 32:05.233
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME
ABOUT YOUR NURSE.

32:05.267 --> 32:08.300
YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY I'M NOT
READY TO BUILD A HOUSE WITH YOU?

32:08.333 --> 32:12.433
THIS IS WHY.
BECAUSE I CANNOT TRUST YOU.
YOU CAN'T TRUST ANYBODY.

32:12.467 --> 32:15.333
AND NO MATTER WHAT I DO...

32:15.367 --> 32:18.233
YOU'RE ALWAYS GONNA LOOK
FOR REASONS NOT TO TRUST ME.

32:18.267 --> 32:21.167
I CAN'T DO IT ANYMORE.

32:21.200 --> 32:23.100
I C--

32:23.133 --> 32:24.433
I CAN'T.

32:24.467 --> 32:26.033
WELL, NEITHER CAN I.

32:26.067 --> 32:29.567

32:40.667 --> 32:44.133

I NEED YOU TO HOLD HANDS.

32:59.333 --> 33:01.733
* I AM DAMAGED AT BEST

33:01.767 --> 33:04.333
WHY?

33:04.367 --> 33:06.667
BECAUSE THE ENERGY IN HERE,
IT'S...

33:06.700 --> 33:08.200
IT'S NOT HEALING.

33:08.233 --> 33:11.133
SO I NEED YOU
TO HOLD HANDS

33:11.167 --> 33:13.533
AND FOCUS
ALL OF YOUR LOVE

33:13.567 --> 33:16.433
ON THIS CHILD.

33:16.467 --> 33:18.100
FOR A FEW MINUTES,

33:18.133 --> 33:20.667
I WANT YOU TO TRY
TO FORGIVE EACH OTHER.

33:20.700 --> 33:22.600

33:22.633 --> 33:26.100
CAN YOU TRY TO DO THAT?

33:29.700 --> 33:33.167
* I'M HOLDING ON

* I'M HOLDING ON

33:36.567 --> 33:40.700
* I'M BARELY HOLDING ON TO YOU

33:40.733 --> 33:44.367
* THE BROKEN LOCKS
WERE A WARNING *

33:44.400 --> 33:48.167
* YOU GOT INSIDE MY HEAD

33:48.200 --> 33:51.300
* I TRIED MY BEST
TO BE GUARDED *

33:51.333 --> 33:55.567
* I'M AN OPEN BOOK INSTEAD

33:55.600 --> 33:58.767

YOUR REFLECTION *

33:58.800 --> 34:03.700

34:03.733 --> 34:06.233
* THAT ARE LOOKING FOR PURPOSE

34:06.267 --> 34:08.400
* THEY'RE STILL LOOKING
FOR LIFE *

34:08.433 --> 34:11.533
* I'M FALLING APART

34:11.567 --> 34:15.300
* I'M BARELY BREATHING

34:15.333 --> 34:19.400

37:52.167 --> 37:54.133
YANG'S GOT NOTHING ON YOU.

37:54.167 --> 37:56.500
***

37:56.533 --> 37:58.067
(Izzie clears throat)

37:58.100 --> 38:01.467
OKAY, THERE ARE FOUR CHAMBERS
IN YOUR HEART,

38:01.500 --> 38:03.400
AND THERE ARE THREE
MAJOR CORONARY ARTERIES

38:03.433 --> 38:05.633
THAT SUPPLY BLOOD
AND OXYGEN...

38:05.667 --> 38:07.500
(Miranda)
AS DOCTORS, WE KNOW MORE

38:07.533 --> 38:09.200
ABOUT THE HUMAN BODY NOW

38:09.233 --> 38:11.133
THAN AT ANY OTHER POINT
IN OUR HISTORY.

38:11.167 --> 38:12.467
THEY EXTUBATED HIM.

38:12.500 --> 38:14.167
HIS BLOOD PRESSURE'S UP,
TOO.

38:14.200 --> 38:15.367
GOOD.

38:15.400 --> 38:17.300
DID YOU KNOW THAT
HIS MIDDLE NAME IS GEORGE?

38:17.333 --> 38:18.833
TUCK'S?

38:18.867 --> 38:20.733
AFTER ME.

38:20.767 --> 38:23.700
HUH. I THOUGHT DR. BAILEY
DIDN'T LIKE INTERNS.

38:23.733 --> 38:25.500
OH, NO.

38:25.533 --> 38:27.633
YEAH, SHE DOESN'T.

38:27.667 --> 38:29.233
D--

38:29.267 --> 38:31.167
DID YOU FIND
AN APARTMENT YET?

38:31.200 --> 38:33.067
BECAUSE I WAS
THINKING OF...

38:33.100 --> 38:35.400
I WAS THINKING MAYBE
I'M GONNA GET ONE, AND...

38:35.433 --> 38:37.333
BUT THE MIRACLE
OF LIFE ITSELF--

38:37.367 --> 38:39.033
WHY PEOPLE LIVE AND DIE,

38:39.067 --> 38:41.167
WHY THEY HURT
OR GET HURT--

38:41.200 --> 38:43.533
IS STILL A MYSTERY.

38:43.567 --> 38:45.633
HERE'S THE THING...

38:45.667 --> 38:47.100
YOU'RE TOO PRETTY.

38:47.133 --> 38:48.633
OH, COME ON.

38:48.667 --> 38:50.633
NO, SO PRETTY, IN FACT,

38:50.667 --> 38:53.533
THAT IF WE DIDN'T
WORK TOGETHER,

38:53.567 --> 38:56.833
WE WOULD PROBABLY BE...

38:56.867 --> 38:59.700
BUT THE POINT IS
WE DO WORK TOGETHER.

38:59.733 --> 39:02.367
AND IN ORDER FOR ME
TO DO MY JOB,

39:02.400 --> 39:04.667
I NEED TO LEAVE WHO I AM

39:04.700 --> 39:07.167
OUTSIDE THE DOORS
OF THIS HOSPITAL.

39:07.200 --> 39:09.133
SO...

39:09.167 --> 39:10.400
(elevator bell dings)

39:10.433 --> 39:13.333
OH, HEY. YOU READY?
I AM.

39:13.367 --> 39:15.700
WHERE YOU GUYS GOING?
YOU GOING TO JOE'S?

39:15.733 --> 39:17.367
I'LL COME MEET YOU.

39:17.400 --> 39:18.633
GOOD NIGHT, DR. SLOAN.

39:18.667 --> 39:21.767
WE WANT TO KNOW THE REASON,
THE SECRET,

39:21.800 --> 39:24.300
THE ANSWER
AT THE BACK OF THE BOOK...

39:24.333 --> 39:28.067
DO YOU WANT TO GO
TO DINNER WITH ME TONIGHT?

39:28.100 --> 39:29.267
I THOUGHT YOU WEREN'T FREE.

39:29.300 --> 39:31.067
TURNS OUT I AM.

39:31.100 --> 39:33.200
AND I'D LIKE TO GO OUT
WITH YOU TONIGHT.

39:33.233 --> 39:35.633
DO YOU WANT
TO GO OUT WITH ME?

39:35.667 --> 39:37.500
THAT'D BE NICE.

39:37.533 --> 39:40.433
BECAUSE THE THOUGHT OF OUR
BEING ALL ALONE DOWN HERE

39:40.467 --> 39:43.600
IS JUST TOO MUCH
FOR US TO BEAR.

39:43.633 --> 39:45.833
HOW'S HE DOING?

39:45.867 --> 39:47.467
HE'S GONNA BE
JUST FINE.

39:47.500 --> 39:49.733
***

39:49.767 --> 39:51.833
WHERE'S YOUR HUSBAND?

39:51.867 --> 39:56.033
UH, HE WENT HOME
TO GET SOME SLEEP...

39:56.067 --> 39:57.567
AND TO PACK HIS THINGS

39:57.600 --> 40:02.467
'CAUSE HE'S GETTING HIMSELF
A HOTEL ROOM TONIGHT.

40:02.500 --> 40:04.633
I'M SORRY.

40:04.667 --> 40:06.333
FOR SOME REASON,

40:06.367 --> 40:09.533
LIFE JUST SEEMS TO MAKE
A LOT MORE SENSE

40:09.567 --> 40:11.467
WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING
AT A BABY.

40:11.500 --> 40:15.167
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY...

40:15.200 --> 40:18.500
THE FACT THAT WE SHOW UP
FOR EACH OTHER,

40:18.533 --> 40:21.800
IN SPITE OF OUR DIFFERENCES,
NO MATTER WHAT WE BELIEVE,

40:21.833 --> 40:24.767
IS REASON ENOUGH...

40:24.800 --> 40:29.033
TO KEEP BELIEVING.
