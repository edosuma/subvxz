or Chase was trying

01:40.391 --> 01:42.060
to suck the teeth out
of her mouth.

01:42.143 --> 01:43.686

01:43.770 --> 01:46.022

01:46.105 --> 01:48.274

01:55.615 --> 01:56.866

01:56.950 --> 01:58.159
- He said, "This is Rebecca,
my girlfriend."

01:58.243 --> 02:00.870
- You're sure he said
"girlfriend"?

02:00.954 --> 02:03.122
- 'Cause maybe you
misunderstood.

02:03.206 --> 02:05.041
Maybe he said "grill friend."

02:05.124 --> 02:07.293

- Yeah.

02:07.377 --> 02:10.839
You know, maybe they just cook
things together outdoors.

02:13.049 --> 02:14.342
- How did you meet this girl?

02:14.425 --> 02:15.426
- Well, uh, she's
from my hometown.

02:15.510 --> 02:17.178
Her mom and my mom work
in the same office

02:17.262 --> 02:20.390
so that's how she heard
about PCA.

02:20.473 --> 02:21.766
- Okay.

02:21.850 --> 02:23.017
- So Rebecca's mom asked my mom

02:23.101 --> 02:24.894
if I'd go out to lunch with her
and, you know,

02:24.978 --> 02:27.021
tell her what it's like going
to school here.

02:28.731 --> 02:31.025
After a while, you know, we
started calling each other,

02:31.109 --> 02:32.402
text messaging, and then we just
started going out.

02:32.485 --> 02:35.405
- I don't like her.
- What's to like?

02:35.488 --> 02:37.824
- You guys don't even know her.
- We don't have to know her.

02:37.907 --> 02:39.242
- You're our friend so we can
just automatically hate her.

02:39.325 --> 02:42.537
- Look, I appreciate
your pointless hatred

02:42.620 --> 02:45.248
of Chase's girlfriend,
but it's really not necessary.

02:45.331 --> 02:47.750

having a girlfriend?

02:47.834 --> 02:48.376

02:51.671 --> 02:54.465

in the basket once?

02:54.549 --> 02:55.466

02:55.550 --> 02:57.969

You try.

03:10.356 --> 03:12.442
Last year,
a week before summer vacation,

03:12.525 --> 03:14.986
you sent Zoey a text message
saying you love her.

03:15.069 --> 03:16.362
And now after summer,

03:16.446 --> 03:17.697

03:25.914 --> 03:27.624

03:27.707 --> 03:29.125
- Well, I think
there's a reason

03:29.208 --> 03:31.544
why Zoey didn't get
that text message.

03:31.628 --> 03:33.504

the universe, the Lord,

something was trying to tell me
that Zoey and I are meant

03:39.552 --> 03:42.639
to be really good friends,
and that's all.

03:42.722 --> 03:43.890

03:43.973 --> 03:45.391
- Yeah, I mean,
look at it like this.

A guy's going to have a lot of
girlfriends in his life, right?

03:48.144 --> 03:49.646
- That is certainly
my intention.

03:49.729 --> 03:52.023

to be just another one

- She said--
You know?

20:48.956 --> 20:52.000
- She came to my room and told
me to stay away from you.

20:52.084 --> 20:56.004
- Yeah, she sort of said
the same thing to me today.

20:56.088 --> 20:58.382
- Did you explain to her
we're just friends?

20:58.465 --> 21:01.009
- Yeah.
- And she said...?

21:01.093 --> 21:03.345
- That if I want her to be
my girlfriend

21:03.428 --> 21:04.304
that I can't--

21:06.556 --> 21:09.851
I can't hang out with you
anymore or talk to you.

21:10.686 --> 21:13.021
- [sighs]

21:13.105 --> 21:13.689
Okay.

21:13.772 --> 21:15.857
I get it.

21:15.941 --> 21:17.526
Look, the most important thing
to me

21:17.609 --> 21:19.611
is that--is that you're happy.

21:19.695 --> 21:22.614
- Me too.

21:25.701 --> 21:26.994
So I dumped her.

21:27.077 --> 21:29.579
<i>♪ ♪</i>

21:29.663 --> 21:30.122
Uh-huh, dumped.

21:30.205 --> 21:32.541
As in, "see ya."

21:32.624 --> 21:34.209
- Oh, my God.
Was she really upset?

21:34.292 --> 21:36.003
- Uh-huh.
- [chuckles]

21:36.086 --> 21:38.922
Good, that little skunk bag.

21:39.006 --> 21:41.341
- Zoey Brooks, such language.

21:41.425 --> 21:42.884
- Well, she was horrible.

21:42.968 --> 21:44.261
- Yeah.
I kind of figured that out.

21:44.344 --> 21:45.262
[chuckles]

21:45.345 --> 21:46.346
Can I have a grape?

21:46.430 --> 21:47.556
- One.

21:49.349 --> 21:49.766
So, question...

21:49.850 --> 21:52.310
- Ask me.

21:52.394 --> 21:54.521
- Doesn't it bug you that
people think guys and girls

21:54.604 --> 21:56.356
can't just be friends?

21:56.440 --> 21:57.983
- Yeah, people are dumb.

21:58.066 --> 22:01.403
So, hey, can we make a pact?

22:01.486 --> 22:03.030
Next time I get a girlfriend
or you get a boyfriend,

22:03.113 --> 22:04.239
can we promise each other

22:04.322 --> 22:07.242
to never let it affect
our friendship?

22:07.325 --> 22:10.746
- Promise.
- Promise.

22:10.829 --> 22:12.998
- Oh, and one more thing--

22:13.081 --> 22:14.833
- Yes?

22:14.916 --> 22:16.251
Ow!

22:16.334 --> 22:17.544
What up with the violence?

22:17.627 --> 22:19.004
- That was for scaring me.

22:19.087 --> 22:20.088
You made me think you were going
to stop being my friend.

22:20.172 --> 22:21.423
- I told you I dumped her.

22:21.506 --> 22:24.217
- Well, you should have started
with that.

22:24.301 --> 22:27.637
- Ah, you could put an eye out.

22:27.721 --> 22:29.264
- That's the goal.

22:29.347 --> 22:29.931
- Oh, you've done it now.

22:30.015 --> 22:32.142
The grape war is on.

22:32.225 --> 22:32.434
- Bring it.

22:37.773 --> 22:38.857
- You have a pretty good arm.

22:38.940 --> 22:41.693
- You throw like a girl.

22:41.777 --> 22:43.320
- Better than being one.

22:44.613 --> 22:46.990
Ow, that's my chest plate.
