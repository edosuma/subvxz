- I should've gone
on a swamp tour.

06:22.215 --> 06:23.432
<i>- I don't know.</i>

06:23.550 --> 06:24.642
<i>I swear he's got
a meth lab on his farm,</i>

06:24.759 --> 06:25.885
<i>the way he keeps
going for days.</i>

06:26.011 --> 06:27.809
- I don't know
what else to tell you, Hamil.

06:27.929 --> 06:30.478
Just get the neighbor
to quiet down.

06:30.599 --> 06:33.978
Look, we got every major drunk
from Mardi Gras down here.

06:34.102 --> 06:35.274
There's no room.

06:35.395 --> 06:37.193
<i>- He tried to give me
a speeding ticket.</i>

06:38.273 --> 06:39.946
- Just make it happen.

06:40.066 --> 06:40.942
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

06:41.067 --> 06:41.989
- How we doing, Winslow?

06:42.110 --> 06:43.032
- Morning, Sheriff.

06:46.114 --> 06:47.912
- Well, New Orleans P.D.
sent us another handful

06:48.033 --> 06:49.285
to hold overnight.

06:49.409 --> 06:50.956
And Hamilton's
out at Sable Ranch.

06:51.077 --> 06:52.670
<i>' Again?</i>

06:56.875 --> 07:00.095
All in all,
not that bad a year.

07:00.211 --> 07:01.588
- Honestly, not bad at all.

07:01.713 --> 07:04.557
<i>' Shes got a gun!</i>

07:14.267 --> 07:15.143
- I killed him.

07:15.268 --> 07:16.770
- Drop the gun now!

07:16.895 --> 07:18.522
- Get on the floor now!

07:18.647 --> 07:19.523
- Put it down.

07:19.648 --> 07:21.616
- On the floor!

07:21.733 --> 07:22.985
Spread 'em!

07:23.109 --> 07:24.326
- Wait.
She has something in her hand.

07:24.444 --> 07:25.320
- What is it?

07:26.696 --> 07:27.913
- My God.

07:28.573 --> 07:29.540
It's a fucking scalp!

07:29.658 --> 07:30.500
- On.

07:32.786 --> 07:33.662
- Who?

07:33.787 --> 07:35.505
Who'd you kill?

07:35.622 --> 07:37.090
- They're all dead.

07:38.875 --> 07:40.127
- Who's dead?

07:41.586 --> 07:43.338
- Honey Island Swamp.

07:44.130 --> 07:46.349
- I need an available boat unit
out to Honey Island Swamp now.

07:46.466 --> 07:47.934
Hamilton, you there?

07:48.051 --> 07:49.519
- I killed him.

07:55.183 --> 07:56.685
I killed him.

08:29.300 --> 08:31.052
- Any injuries?

08:31.177 --> 08:34.226
- No, nothing noticeable, sir.

08:34.347 --> 08:38.193
- Are you trying to tell me
that none of that blood is hers?

09:00.707 --> 09:02.334
How many bodies
you say there were?

09:03.543 --> 09:06.672
<i>- 20, 30.</i>

09:06.796 --> 09:07.797
- Mm-hmm.

09:07.922 --> 09:09.265
And you're the only one
who made it,

09:09.382 --> 09:11.384
just a few scratches.

09:11.509 --> 09:13.102
No major injuries, huh?

09:14.804 --> 09:16.272
- Yes.

09:16.389 --> 09:19.268
- You see how this could look
just a tiny bit suspicious,

09:19.392 --> 09:20.644
don't you?

09:20.769 --> 09:24.899
- Sheriff Fowler, there is
no answer at the Dunston house.

09:25.023 --> 09:26.115
- Try again.

09:26.232 --> 09:27.779
- I have, five times.

09:27.901 --> 09:29.574
- Well, then get in your car

09:29.694 --> 09:32.664
and drive over there,
Deputy Elbert.

09:32.781 --> 09:33.828
- Yes, sir.

09:33.948 --> 09:34.949
I'm on it.

09:37.077 --> 09:38.374
- Nobody's home.

09:38.495 --> 09:39.496
Crowley killed them all.

09:39.621 --> 09:41.373
- Enough about Victor Crowley.

09:41.498 --> 09:42.374
- He slaughtered-

09:42.499 --> 09:44.593
- We know who Victor Crowley is.

09:46.377 --> 09:50.132
And we also know...

09:50.256 --> 09:52.008
what reality is.

09:53.301 --> 09:56.020
So let me see
if I got this straight.

09:56.137 --> 09:57.889
You suspected Victor Crowley

09:58.014 --> 10:00.187
of killing your father
and your...

10:00.308 --> 10:02.402
- Brother.

10:02.519 --> 10:05.693
Right, so you
jumped in a swamp tour boat-

10:05.814 --> 10:07.657
an illegal swamp tour boat-

10:07.774 --> 10:09.822
and headed back out
into the swamp

10:09.943 --> 10:11.911
armed with nothing
but a handgun.

10:12.987 --> 10:16.617
A ghost wiped out
everyone in front of you.

10:17.742 --> 10:20.461
You found out
that your family was dead.

10:20.578 --> 10:22.205
And you barely escape
with your life.

10:22.330 --> 10:23.877
But then the next night,

10:23.998 --> 10:26.092
you go back out
into that same swamp,

10:26.209 --> 10:28.462
chase that same damn ghost,

10:28.586 --> 10:31.055
and you bring
more people with you?

10:31.172 --> 10:34.426
Now, why would you
do something like that?

10:34.551 --> 10:36.349
That has to be
the stupidest story

10:36.469 --> 10:39.518
and some of the most idiotic
and contrived decision-making

10:39.639 --> 10:40.640
I've ever heard.

10:42.809 --> 10:45.403
- I'm telling you the truth.

10:45.520 --> 10:46.692
- I don't think you realize

10:46.813 --> 10:49.236
the kind of deep shit you're in,
little girl.

10:50.567 --> 10:53.116
You come into
a Goddamn police station

10:53.236 --> 10:55.364
covered in someone else's blood,
head to toe.

10:55.488 --> 10:56.660
You're carrying a weapon

10:56.781 --> 10:59.250
and a piece
of somebody's fucking head.

10:59.367 --> 11:01.745
And the best you've got for me
for an alibi

11:01.870 --> 11:03.713
is some kind of urban legend?

11:04.998 --> 11:06.591
Hey!

11:06.708 --> 11:11.179
I am talking to you.

11:12.839 --> 11:14.716
Let me tell you something.

11:14.841 --> 11:16.935
You go up in front of the judge,

11:17.051 --> 11:18.644
you better come up
with a better excuse-

11:18.761 --> 11:19.853
<i>- Sheriff, come in.</i>

11:19.971 --> 11:21.393
- Yeah, I'm here.

11:21.514 --> 11:23.642
<i>- Sir, it's, uh...</i>

11:23.766 --> 11:25.643
- What is it, Hamilton?
Spit it out.

11:25.768 --> 11:29.238
<i>- It's a fucking massacre
out here, sir.</i>

11:29.355 --> 11:31.778
<i>I mean, we've only
covered about</i>

11:31.900 --> 11:33.948
40 yards, and we've already
come up with about four bodies.

11:34.068 --> 11:36.787
I mean, we...

11:36.905 --> 11:37.906
Jesus.

11:38.031 --> 11:39.704
They don't even have faces,
Louis.

11:50.877 --> 11:51.799
- Look, we're gonna
have to call in

11:51.920 --> 11:53.046
every Goddamn paramedic
in the state

11:53.171 --> 11:55.424
and a full recovery team
right away.

11:55.548 --> 11:56.845
<i>We're talking about</i>

11:56.966 --> 12:00.266
<i>DNA-and-dental-records-level
shit out here, man.</i>

12:00.386 --> 12:01.729
<i>Shit, they don't even
have teeth, though.</i>

12:02.972 --> 12:05.395
- We got a girl in custody.

12:05.516 --> 12:07.769
I'm on my way.

12:07.894 --> 12:10.113
<i>- All right, but we're gonna
have to call in state, Sheriff.</i>

12:10.230 --> 12:11.197
<i>We don't even know
how many bodies</i>

12:11.314 --> 12:12.566
<i>we're dealing with out here.</i>

12:12.690 --> 12:13.942
<i>Shit, we just keep
finding pieces everywhere.</i>

12:14.067 --> 12:17.287
- I said, I am on my way,
Deputy.

12:19.739 --> 12:21.912
- Sir, do you want me to go?

12:22.033 --> 12:23.250
- I'll call you if I need you.

12:23.368 --> 12:25.541
Get the fire and paramedics
out there right away.

12:25.662 --> 12:26.914
- I'm on it.

12:28.039 --> 12:29.165
- Fuck off.

12:29.290 --> 12:30.758
- This is Deputy Winslow.
I need all available...

12:31.668 --> 12:33.295
- All right, everybody, get
your dicks out of your hands.

12:33.419 --> 12:34.636
Time to go to work.

12:34.754 --> 12:36.097
These dead bodies
ain't finding themselves.

12:36.214 --> 12:39.013
Come on now.
Double time.

12:48.726 --> 12:50.399
- Would you tell them there's
not gonna be an official comment

12:50.520 --> 12:51.737
until there's been
a full investigation

12:51.854 --> 12:52.980
of the crime scene?

12:53.106 --> 12:54.983
I'm probably gonna
be out there all day.

12:55.108 --> 12:56.826
What?

12:56.943 --> 13:00.197
- Sheriff, I think you have a...

13:00.321 --> 13:01.823
- Shit.

13:03.616 --> 13:04.617
- Hi, Louis.

13:06.077 --> 13:07.454
- Not today, Amanda, okay?
Seriously.

13:07.578 --> 13:09.956
- I need this.
I need this, Louis.

13:10.081 --> 13:11.708
- I don't know
what you're talking about.

13:11.833 --> 13:12.709
- Oh, come on.

13:12.834 --> 13:14.836
Multiple bodies.
Honey Island Swamp.

13:14.961 --> 13:16.429
Girl in custody.

13:16.546 --> 13:18.014
- That is police business, okay?

13:18.131 --> 13:19.348
It's not what you think it is.

13:19.465 --> 13:21.263
- Oh, this has Victor Crowley
written all over it.

13:21.384 --> 13:22.385
Are you out of your mind?

13:24.137 --> 13:25.263
Please let me on that scene.

13:25.388 --> 13:26.435
Let me cover this story.

13:26.556 --> 13:27.682
- Get in line.

13:27.807 --> 13:28.979
- You know,
for the last ten years,

13:29.100 --> 13:30.352
I've been a punch line
on the media blacklist

13:30.476 --> 13:31.523
for my Crowley study.

13:31.644 --> 13:32.770
This is an opportunity-

13:32.895 --> 13:34.192
- Crowley study?

13:34.314 --> 13:36.817
Is that what you're calling it
right now'?

13:36.941 --> 13:40.161
I thought it was more like
obsessive sensationalism.

13:40.278 --> 13:42.155
- Now, you just listen here.

13:42.280 --> 13:44.203
I am wounded.

13:44.324 --> 13:45.701
I would like to have access.

13:45.825 --> 13:46.997
Please let me break this story.

13:47.118 --> 13:48.540
Please, Louis.

13:48.661 --> 13:49.753
- As of right now,

13:49.871 --> 13:51.794
all we know is,
there's a possible murder

13:51.914 --> 13:53.837
outside of Jefferson Parish.

13:53.958 --> 13:56.677
No further comment.

13:56.794 --> 13:58.011
- I heard "massacre. "

13:58.129 --> 14:00.507
I heard "unidentified bodies
in pieces. "

14:00.631 --> 14:01.928
- Jesus H. Christ.
- "Faces missing"?

14:02.050 --> 14:03.302
- Amanda,
that is a police frequency.

14:03.426 --> 14:04.393
Stay off of it.

14:04.510 --> 14:06.433
- I have First Amendment fights,
Louis.

14:07.805 --> 14:08.931
Come on.

14:09.057 --> 14:11.151
Let me work on this story.

14:11.267 --> 14:13.941
Give me a chance here.

14:15.313 --> 14:16.439
It's me.

14:19.734 --> 14:20.906
- So how's Arwin?

14:21.027 --> 14:22.244
- She's good.

14:22.362 --> 14:24.490
No worms or fleas,
and she's been living with me.

14:26.366 --> 14:28.368
- Well, maybe a vulture
picked 'em off.

14:30.870 --> 14:32.087
- Sheriff!
- Sheriff!

14:32.205 --> 14:33.297
- Can we get a comment?

14:33.414 --> 14:35.291
- Come on, guys.
I can't.

14:35.416 --> 14:36.292
Not today.
Please.

14:36.417 --> 14:37.418
Come on.

14:38.711 --> 14:40.930
- Sheriff, Sheriff, can you give
us any information at all?

14:41.047 --> 14:42.094
- Bloodsuckers.

14:42.215 --> 14:43.341
- Sheriff!
Come on.

14:43.466 --> 14:44.638
Something?

14:51.265 --> 14:52.266
- Hey, Elliot.

14:54.560 --> 14:55.607
How you doing?

14:55.728 --> 14:57.150
- Not today, Mrs. Fowler.

14:57.271 --> 14:59.023
- Well, actually,
it's Miss Perlman now.

14:59.148 --> 15:01.697
- Well, you'll always be
Mrs. Fowler to me.

15:01.818 --> 15:03.115
And it's Deputy now.

15:03.236 --> 15:05.034
- That's nice.

15:05.655 --> 15:06.952
How's Adrianne?

15:07.073 --> 15:08.325
- We broke up.

15:08.449 --> 15:09.826
2005.

15:09.951 --> 15:11.624
- On.

15:11.744 --> 15:13.462
So where's the suspect?

15:13.579 --> 15:14.705
- That's none of your concern.

15:14.831 --> 15:16.879
- Really?

15:16.999 --> 15:18.717
'Cause I'm about
to post her bail.

15:27.802 --> 15:29.224
- All right, people,
we're gonna have to spread out

15:29.345 --> 15:30.517
the recovery search
a few more miles.

15:30.638 --> 15:32.481
Hyde keeps finding pieces.

15:32.598 --> 15:34.475
- Which way?

15:34.600 --> 15:36.602
- Take your pick.
They keep popping up everywhere.

15:36.727 --> 15:37.899
- Right.

15:38.020 --> 15:39.192
Where the hell
are the paramedics?

15:39.313 --> 15:40.280
- Always the last ones
on the scene.

15:40.398 --> 15:41.274
You know that.

15:44.819 --> 15:46.412
Speak of the devils, huh?

15:55.455 --> 15:56.672
- You Hamilton?

15:56.789 --> 15:58.416
- Yeah, that's me.

15:58.541 --> 16:00.339
- Jim Duffy.
You in charge?

16:00.460 --> 16:01.632
- Yeah, for the moment,

16:01.752 --> 16:03.800
but Sheriff Fowler from
Jefferson Parish is on his way.

16:03.921 --> 16:05.423
Just a little tied up
with press.

16:06.591 --> 16:07.558
- Fuckin' maggots.

16:07.675 --> 16:09.302
- Yeah, you're telling me.

16:09.427 --> 16:11.020
- So what are
we talking about here,

16:11.137 --> 16:12.059
three bodies, six?

16:12.180 --> 16:14.308
- Shit.
Try 20 or 30.

16:15.475 --> 16:17.227
- What the fuck happened?

16:17.351 --> 16:18.523
- Well,
it's all under investigation,

16:18.644 --> 16:20.521
but we do have a girl
in custody.

16:23.608 --> 16:24.484
- A girl?

16:24.609 --> 16:26.031
You guys think a girl did this?

16:26.152 --> 16:28.405
- Shit, yeah.
We got good reason too.

16:29.530 --> 16:31.783
- You guys don't tell us
how to do our job,

16:31.908 --> 16:33.785
we won't tell you
how you suck at yours.

16:36.662 --> 16:37.879
Uh, all right, guys.

16:37.997 --> 16:39.795
Let's start gathering
the bodies over here.

16:39.916 --> 16:41.918
Bob, Randy, bag and tag.

16:42.043 --> 16:43.886
Andrew, come with me.

16:44.003 --> 16:45.380
- What happened?

16:45.505 --> 16:47.758
- Some people died
and made a mess.

16:47.882 --> 16:51.261
Barney Fife back there, he says
they got a girl in custody.

16:51.385 --> 16:53.387
- A girl?
- Yep.

16:53.513 --> 16:55.936
- We're not gonna be out here
all night, are we?

16:56.057 --> 16:57.183
- How the fuck do I know,
Andrew?

16:57.308 --> 16:58.651
What are you,
scared or something?

16:58.768 --> 17:00.987
- You know where we are, right?

17:01.103 --> 17:03.356
- Be a man.
Have a Twinkie.

17:07.818 --> 17:09.444
- What girl did that?

17:09.569 --> 17:11.288
<i>Lock buzzing</i>

17:26.295 --> 17:28.297
You're awake.

17:31.300 --> 17:32.677
I'm Amanda Perlman.

17:32.802 --> 17:33.724
You don't know me.

17:33.844 --> 17:36.688
I tried to post your bail.

17:36.806 --> 17:38.274
But you have to go
before a judge for that,

17:38.391 --> 17:40.314
and there's no bail set, so...

17:41.811 --> 17:43.233
I'm a journalist.

17:43.354 --> 17:45.903
I'm sort of the local expert
on the Victor Crowley legend.

17:46.023 --> 17:47.525
Had a big, splashy article
not long ago,

17:47.650 --> 17:48.776
local legends and lore.

17:48.901 --> 17:49.902
- The Bayou Butcher.

17:50.027 --> 17:51.404
Yeah, I saw you on Montel.

17:51.529 --> 17:52.997
- Oh, you saw that?
Yeah.

17:53.114 --> 17:56.835
Well, you know,
not my best career move.

17:58.786 --> 18:00.538
Been trolling
county websites ever since,

18:00.663 --> 18:02.757
but, you know-I just-

18:02.873 --> 18:05.092
I have a belief
and I have a passion

18:05.209 --> 18:06.461
for the Victor Crowley legend.

18:06.586 --> 18:10.136
And it's kind of made me
a national journalism joke.

18:10.256 --> 18:12.850
And one minute,
you're on national TV.

18:13.968 --> 18:15.686
- What the fuck
do you want from me?

18:18.598 --> 18:21.522
- Well, I don't want
to waste your time.

18:21.642 --> 18:23.110
I can see you're busy.

18:24.854 --> 18:26.322
I just wanted to, you know,

18:26.439 --> 18:27.736
interview you
about what happened,

18:27.857 --> 18:28.904
find out what you saw.

18:30.067 --> 18:31.614
Listen, I can help you.

18:32.612 --> 18:34.455
You know, if I can prove that
the ghost of Victor Crowley

18:34.572 --> 18:36.995
actually exists,
that would help me a lot.

18:38.868 --> 18:42.122
- So you want me
to help you, right?

18:42.246 --> 18:43.122
Right?

18:43.247 --> 18:44.624
- Yeah, that's right.

18:45.916 --> 18:48.465
I mean, right now, you're
looking at a lifetime in jail.

18:49.629 --> 18:51.302
I might be the best chance
and the best friend you've got.

18:51.422 --> 18:54.722
- No offense, but fuck you.

18:54.842 --> 18:57.095
I want a fuckin' lawyer,
not a blogger.

18:57.219 --> 18:59.347
- All right, Amanda.
I gave you your two minutes.

18:59.472 --> 19:01.520
You can't be back here.
If Louis finds out-

19:01.641 --> 19:02.688
- Now, you just listen to me.

19:02.808 --> 19:04.355
We're gonna
run through this again,

19:04.477 --> 19:08.573
Marybeth Dunston,
daughter of Samson Dunston,

19:08.689 --> 19:11.158
washed-up local drunk,
who,

19:11.275 --> 19:12.697
if he's even
got enough education

19:12.818 --> 19:14.741
to sign off on
your death penalty acceptance,

19:14.862 --> 19:17.285
would have to be poured out
of a local bar to do it.

19:18.199 --> 19:20.452
And let's not forget
your brother Ainsley.

19:20.576 --> 19:22.874
How many dozen DUl he got?

19:22.995 --> 19:24.668
Oh, and those three months
community service

19:24.789 --> 19:26.416
for defacing a church?

19:27.958 --> 19:29.710
Look, I know you didn't do this,

19:29.835 --> 19:32.338
but you're gonna go down for it
'cause you're po' white trash.

19:33.464 --> 19:34.807
You know what they do
with po' white trash

19:34.924 --> 19:37.803
who are convicted
on a capital charge?

19:39.679 --> 19:42.523
The state of Louisiana
will execute you.

19:43.974 --> 19:45.692
So you go ahead
and you sit in here.

19:45.810 --> 19:48.734
You can bark at me
like a big dog in a cage.

19:49.355 --> 19:50.572
But at the end of the day,

19:50.690 --> 19:54.320
you can either help me
prove Victor Crowley exists,

19:54.443 --> 19:55.911
or you can wait
for the lethal injection

19:56.028 --> 19:57.871
that's gonna end
your miserable life.

20:03.202 --> 20:04.203
- Do it.

20:06.539 --> 20:07.586
- I couldn't help but notice,

20:07.707 --> 20:10.085
your pappy
ain't been here to see you.

20:10.209 --> 20:12.211
Must be happy hour somewhere.

20:13.170 --> 20:14.092
Maybe he'll show up

20:14.213 --> 20:19.060
after he's panhandled enough
pocket change for a Pabst.

20:19.176 --> 20:21.770
- My father is dead.

20:21.887 --> 20:24.231
Victor Crowley killed him.

20:27.601 --> 20:31.231
- Please, tell me what happened.

20:31.355 --> 20:33.949
I know I can help you.

20:43.325 --> 20:44.451
Fine.

20:47.079 --> 20:49.252
I'll wait.

21:09.435 --> 21:11.813
- Son of a bitch.

21:11.937 --> 21:13.109
Where the hell
are the other guys?

21:13.773 --> 21:15.195
- Holy shit.

21:15.316 --> 21:16.909
Where the fuck
did all this rain come from?

21:21.113 --> 21:22.490
Randy.

21:25.576 --> 21:27.670
One, two, three.
- Holy shit.

21:31.248 --> 21:32.625
What'd you guys bring me,
a giant?

21:32.750 --> 21:35.378
- Yeah, it's hard to tell.

21:35.503 --> 21:37.380
This poor bastard
was lying on top

21:37.505 --> 21:39.348
of the biggest chain saw
I've ever seen in my life.

21:39.465 --> 21:40.591
I haven't found his head yet,

21:40.716 --> 21:42.844
and his body's in a lot
of different pieces.

21:42.968 --> 21:44.185
- Jesus.

21:44.303 --> 21:46.351
- Yeah, well, I thought
you might want to take a look

21:46.472 --> 21:47.815
at this one right away.

21:47.932 --> 21:49.354
They guy looks like he had
all kinds of muscular

21:49.475 --> 21:51.603
and skin deformities.

21:52.895 --> 21:54.272
And he was
only wearing overalls.

21:54.396 --> 21:55.864
- Get the fuck out.

21:55.981 --> 21:57.528
- I know, right?

21:57.650 --> 22:00.699
Anyway, it looks like this one
in particular might be-

22:00.820 --> 22:04.324
I don't know-a crucial
component in all of this.

22:04.448 --> 22:05.665
- Wait a minute.
You don't think that-

22:05.783 --> 22:07.877
- I'm not saying shit,
all right'?

22:07.993 --> 22:10.337
All I'm saying is that
you might want to drop

22:10.454 --> 22:13.833
whatever you're doing
and check this one over first.

22:14.667 --> 22:15.759
- Awesome.

22:15.876 --> 22:17.128
Gonna be fucking creepy,
but awesome.

22:17.253 --> 22:18.175
Let's go.

22:20.464 --> 22:22.307
Come on, big man.
We got a date.

22:34.520 --> 22:37.364
One, two...

22:38.649 --> 22:40.447
Dude, I'm telling you
this may be it,

22:40.568 --> 22:42.320
and I've seen
some crazy shit, man.

22:42.444 --> 22:45.448
I was working on an Asian male,
head severed off,

22:45.573 --> 22:47.871
leg cut off below the knee.

22:47.992 --> 22:49.084
I'm telling you, man.

22:49.201 --> 22:50.623
He looked kind of like you, man.

22:52.371 --> 22:54.499
- Oh, what?
Because I'm Asian?

22:54.623 --> 22:56.546
- No, dude,
because you were-

22:56.667 --> 22:58.169
- Yeah, I get it.

22:58.294 --> 23:00.046
We all look the same, right?

23:00.170 --> 23:02.423
Ha, ha, ha.
It's hilarious.

23:04.258 --> 23:05.931
Asshole.

23:06.051 --> 23:07.644
- Oh, fuck that.

23:14.059 --> 23:15.527
- He was shredded to pieces.

23:15.644 --> 23:19.274
There was nothing left
to possibly get back up again.

23:19.398 --> 23:22.277
I mean, taking his head off
wasn't enough.

23:22.401 --> 23:24.779
Dismembering him was.

23:24.904 --> 23:25.780
I got away.

23:25.905 --> 23:28.454
- Now, what time was this?

23:28.574 --> 23:31.874
- This morning.
I don't know.

23:31.994 --> 23:34.964
Reverend Zombie thought
that by letting Crowley

23:35.080 --> 23:38.004
kill the three people that
were responsible for his death,

23:38.125 --> 23:39.877
somehow the curse
would be lifted and-

23:40.002 --> 23:42.755
I don't know-
he would just go away.

23:43.422 --> 23:45.095
It was all bullshit.

23:45.215 --> 23:46.512
- Hmm.

23:46.634 --> 23:48.807
<i>According to my research when I
interviewed a voodoo priestess-</i>

23:48.928 --> 23:50.771
and she was a real
voodoo priestess-

23:50.888 --> 23:53.357
- She was a real voodoo
priestess, of course.

23:53.474 --> 23:54.817
- I know it sounds crazy.

23:54.934 --> 23:56.311
But if anybody
should be a believer,

23:56.435 --> 23:58.733
I would imagine
it would be you.

23:58.854 --> 23:59.821
According to the legend,

23:59.939 --> 24:02.317
Victor Crowley
is cursed as a repeater.

24:02.441 --> 24:04.864
Each night, he has
to return exactly as he was

24:04.985 --> 24:06.532
when he died, okay?

24:06.654 --> 24:09.498
He has to relive the night of
his death in an endless cycle

24:09.615 --> 24:10.491
over and over again.

24:10.616 --> 24:11.833
You can't kill him.

24:11.951 --> 24:13.999
He's already dead.

24:14.119 --> 24:14.995
It's kind of sad, really.

24:15.120 --> 24:18.841
- I sawed his body
into little pieces.

24:18.958 --> 24:21.381
I'm pretty sure he's dead.

24:21.502 --> 24:22.628
- I don't know.

24:22.753 --> 24:24.050
The priestess said no amount
of physical damage

24:24.171 --> 24:25.514
can keep him from
returning again and again

24:25.631 --> 24:27.429
in his original form.

24:28.968 --> 24:30.811
- He's dead.

24:32.096 --> 24:33.222
- He's not.

25:04.420 --> 25:05.672
- Any sign of the Sheriff yet?

25:05.796 --> 25:06.672
- Nothing yet.

25:06.797 --> 25:08.140
- AW, shit.

25:08.257 --> 25:09.725
Well, he should be here soon,
all right?

25:09.842 --> 25:10.843
I'm on channel six
when you see him.

25:10.968 --> 25:13.562
- Hey, any more bodies?

25:13.679 --> 25:16.523
- Man, it's hard to tell.

25:16.640 --> 25:19.393
It looks like we got a whole
area down there by the cabin,

25:19.518 --> 25:21.566
a whole crime scene over there,
a whole mess of bodies.

25:21.687 --> 25:22.813
Even more to the east.

25:24.940 --> 25:26.237
My call?

25:26.358 --> 25:28.235
I think the victims
were in two separate groups.

25:28.360 --> 25:30.704
Hell, they probably didn't
even see each other down there,

25:30.821 --> 25:33.574
coming each way,
different directions?

25:33.699 --> 25:35.872
Man, how the hell
do you deal with that smell?

25:37.286 --> 25:39.004
Takes a couple years,
but you do get used to it.

25:40.122 --> 25:41.089
Another day on the job for me.

25:41.206 --> 25:43.049
- You know,
close the door, man.

25:43.167 --> 25:44.544
I'll be on six.

27:02.955 --> 27:04.172
- Randy?

27:05.833 --> 27:07.255
- Freeze!

27:07.376 --> 27:08.252
Don't move!

27:20.180 --> 27:21.932
- Shit.
Whoa!

27:24.476 --> 27:25.568
- Hamilton?

27:25.686 --> 27:27.859
<i>- Get off of me right now,
damn it!</i>

27:29.606 --> 27:30.482
- Holy shit.
Holy shit.

27:30.607 --> 27:32.200
Help!
Help!

27:32.317 --> 27:33.864
- Hamilton!

27:38.323 --> 27:40.496
<i>Hamilton, do you read?</i>

27:44.037 --> 27:45.664
Sheriff?

27:45.789 --> 27:46.881
Lou, are you there?

27:46.999 --> 27:48.501
<i>- I heard it.
I got a call into state.</i>

27:48.625 --> 27:50.673
<i>I'm bringing everyone and
everything I can bring with me.</i>

27:50.794 --> 27:52.546
<i>We should be out there
in less than 30.</i>

27:52.671 --> 27:54.514
- You still think he's dead?

27:54.631 --> 27:55.883
- I killed him.

27:56.008 --> 27:58.887
- You didn't.
But I know how.

27:59.011 --> 27:59.887
- How?

28:00.012 --> 28:01.480
- To rid the swamp
of that curse,

28:01.597 --> 28:03.019
we've got to give the ghost
what he wants.

28:03.140 --> 28:04.357
- But he's searching
for his father.

28:04.474 --> 28:05.976
- His father endlessly,
night after night.

28:06.101 --> 28:08.524
Once he has him, he can finally
find peace and pass on-

28:08.645 --> 28:09.771
- That is impossible.

28:09.897 --> 28:11.615
Thomas Crowley
has been dead for years.

28:11.732 --> 28:13.075
- I can explain all of it.

28:13.192 --> 28:14.865
But first I need to know
that you're gonna help me out.

28:14.985 --> 28:17.079
- I already told you
everything that I know.

28:17.196 --> 28:20.075
- You are the only living
relative of Samson Dunston,

28:20.199 --> 28:21.917
the man who caused all of this.

28:22.034 --> 28:24.412
You are the only one
who can end it.

28:24.536 --> 28:27.915
That means you are the only one
who can make it stop.

28:28.040 --> 28:30.088
You heard
what I heard on the radio.

28:30.209 --> 28:32.337
How many more people have to die
before this is over?

28:32.461 --> 28:35.840
- I can't.
- You can.

28:35.964 --> 28:37.887
We're going for a ride.

28:39.968 --> 28:41.220
- Oh, hell no.

28:41.345 --> 28:43.393
<i>- All available units,
we have a report of a man down</i>

28:43.513 --> 28:44.639
<i>by the Honey Island Swamp.</i>

28:44.765 --> 28:46.813
<i>No response from fire,
paramedics on site.</i>

28:46.934 --> 28:48.777
<i>I need all available units
to Honey Island.</i>

28:48.894 --> 28:51.238
<i>All available units
to Honey Island Swamp.</i>

28:51.355 --> 28:53.778
- Elliot, you have to help me,
because if you don't,

28:53.899 --> 28:56.072
everybody in that swamp
is gonna die.

28:56.193 --> 28:57.820
You open that door.

28:57.945 --> 28:58.787
<i>- Look out, look out!</i>

29:03.742 --> 29:06.416
- Open it!

29:08.705 --> 29:10.707
<i>- Oh, he's coming.
Cover me!</i>

29:12.751 --> 29:14.628
<i>' NOW!</i>

29:20.342 --> 29:21.969
- All right,
here's what we know now.

29:22.094 --> 29:25.143
<i>A group of Jefferson Parish
P.D., paramedic, and fire</i>

29:25.264 --> 29:27.141
respond to a report
of a multiple homicide

29:27.266 --> 29:28.358
right here in this area.

29:28.475 --> 29:31.979
There were 12 people,
all of whom are now MIA.

29:32.104 --> 29:33.651
We have one suspect in custody.

29:33.772 --> 29:38.903
And our last contact
was about 45 minutes ago.

29:39.027 --> 29:41.997
But we did receive distress
calls of an unknown attacker

29:42.114 --> 29:43.206
and multiple men down.

29:43.323 --> 29:44.370
- So who's left?

29:44.491 --> 29:46.084
- We're not exactly sure.

29:47.536 --> 29:49.664
- Do we know if the attacker
is still in the area?

29:49.788 --> 29:51.540
- Well, we have to assume so,
yeah.

29:51.665 --> 29:54.669
But, guys, I want you all armed
and at the ready.

29:54.793 --> 29:56.716
We got no idea
what we're dealing with here,

29:56.837 --> 29:59.306
so let's be prepared
for anything, okay?

29:59.423 --> 30:00.720
- Is the attacker armed?

30:00.841 --> 30:02.684
- Definitely, but we just
don't know with what.

30:02.801 --> 30:04.678
- I'll take it from here,
Sheriff.

30:04.803 --> 30:07.181
Officer Hawes,
Louisiana State SWAT.

30:07.306 --> 30:08.478
- Uh, nice to meet you, sir,

30:08.598 --> 30:12.023
but actually,
these are my men and, uh...

30:12.144 --> 30:14.067
Sir'?

30:14.187 --> 30:16.064
- All right,
everybody listen up.

30:16.189 --> 30:17.736
You will give
one verbal warning,

30:17.858 --> 30:19.735
and then you will shoot to kill.

30:19.860 --> 30:20.782
Do I make myself clear?

30:20.902 --> 30:21.869
- Yes, sir.

30:21.987 --> 30:22.988
- Good.

30:23.113 --> 30:24.911
Let's stay together
and move out!

30:31.079 --> 30:32.376
- Son of a bitch.

30:35.792 --> 30:37.669
- What do you got in there,
a nuclear warhead?

30:37.794 --> 30:39.341
- No, but I brought
about every other toy

30:39.463 --> 30:41.010
I could get my hands on.

30:41.131 --> 30:42.849
- You don't fuck around.

30:42.966 --> 30:44.843
Mikaela Dougherty.

30:44.968 --> 30:45.844
- Cory Schneiderman.

30:45.969 --> 30:47.516
It's a pleasure.

30:47.637 --> 30:49.389
- You planning on taking out
a T-Rex tonight?

30:51.516 --> 30:53.564
- You do know where we are,
right?

30:53.685 --> 30:54.652
- Smelly swamp?

30:54.770 --> 30:57.990
- This is his swamp,

30:58.106 --> 31:00.529
Victor Crowley.

31:00.650 --> 31:01.902
- I'm sorry.
I'm new here.

31:02.027 --> 31:03.324
I just transferred
from Arizona.

31:03.445 --> 31:04.822
Who's Victor Crowley?

31:04.946 --> 31:07.290
- A long time ago,
there was this little boy

31:07.407 --> 31:08.875
who was born deformed,
and he-

31:08.992 --> 31:12.166
- Come on.
Let's go, dipshit.

31:12.287 --> 31:15.837
- That guy's
such a fuckin' asshole.

31:15.957 --> 31:17.083
I'll tell you about it later.

31:17.209 --> 31:18.426
- The NRA would be proud.

31:18.543 --> 31:20.545
- I'm a member.

31:28.178 --> 31:31.102
- Can you please
take these cuffs off of me?

31:31.223 --> 31:32.770
- Absolutely not.

31:32.891 --> 31:34.609
I shouldn't even be doing this.

31:34.726 --> 31:35.602
I could lose my job on this.

31:35.727 --> 31:37.354
- Where am I gonna run,

31:37.479 --> 31:38.605
locked up in the back
of this fucking car'?

31:38.730 --> 31:40.698
- Will you please shut up?

31:40.816 --> 31:41.988
- How far is Ozona?

31:42.109 --> 31:43.452
- Ozona?

31:43.568 --> 31:46.367
It's up the 11 freeway
on the other side of Nicholson.

31:46.488 --> 31:47.705
- What's in Ozona?

31:47.823 --> 31:51.453
- Mrs. Fowler, Ozona is nowhere
near Honey Island Swamp.

31:51.576 --> 31:52.793
What we need to do-

31:52.911 --> 31:54.288
- We need to get to Ozona
is what we need to do.

31:54.413 --> 31:57.792
And for the last time,
it's Miss Perlman, Elliot, okay?

31:57.916 --> 31:59.168
Just, you know, call me Amanda.

31:59.292 --> 32:01.260
Do that.
Amanda.

32:01.378 --> 32:03.676
- I thought you were
Sheriff Fowler's wife.

32:03.797 --> 32:05.265
- Ex-wife.

32:05.382 --> 32:06.975
- I need to call the Sheriff and
let him know what we're doing.

32:07.092 --> 32:09.595
- No, you absolutely do not,
not yet.

32:11.471 --> 32:14.020
- Do you understand how much
trouble my ass is gonna be in?

32:14.141 --> 32:15.188
- I tell you what.

32:15.308 --> 32:16.981
Get me to Ozona,
and then you can call Louis

32:17.102 --> 32:17.978
and tell him we're on our way.

32:18.103 --> 32:19.025
Deal?

32:19.146 --> 32:22.150
- What is in Ozona?

32:22.274 --> 32:23.446
- Thomas Crowley.

32:23.567 --> 32:26.411
- Thomas Crowley?
Thomas Crow-

32:26.528 --> 32:27.825
If he were alive,

32:27.946 --> 32:31.166
wouldn't he be like
300 fucking years old by now?

32:31.283 --> 32:32.830
- He's dead.

32:32.951 --> 32:36.080
- So what are we gonna do,
dig him up?

32:36.204 --> 32:37.751
- Not exactly.

32:58.268 --> 33:00.191
- Tell me about the suspect.

33:00.312 --> 33:01.689
- Well, she turned herself in
this morning.

33:01.813 --> 33:05.784
She was covered in someone
else's blood, holding a shotgun.

33:05.901 --> 33:07.198
- Did you get a confession?

33:07.319 --> 33:09.822
- No, she kept carrying on
about some local legend

33:09.946 --> 33:12.199
named Victor Crowley.

33:12.324 --> 33:15.544
- Yeah, well, I'm familiar.

33:15.660 --> 33:18.038
She was in custody when your men
made the distress call, correct?

33:18.163 --> 33:19.506
- Yes, sir.

33:19.623 --> 33:22.467
My guess is that it's one
of these Crowley impersonators;

33:22.584 --> 33:24.211
you know, some local nut
that's heard the ghost story

33:24.336 --> 33:25.679
one time too many.

33:25.795 --> 33:29.049
But she's clearly part of it,
though.

33:29.174 --> 33:31.427
- Yeah, well,
I'll be the judge of that.

33:34.179 --> 33:35.852
I suppose if anybody's
a Crowley expert,

33:35.972 --> 33:38.020
that would be you, right,

33:38.141 --> 33:40.314
being that your wife
is Amanda Fowler, correct?

33:40.435 --> 33:41.311
- Uh, ex.

33:41.436 --> 33:43.905
She's my ex-wife.

33:44.022 --> 33:45.569
- Got a few of those myself.

33:45.690 --> 33:47.567
- Yeah, it's complicated.

33:47.692 --> 33:48.944
You know, when I transferred
from Houston,

33:49.069 --> 33:52.994
I thought she and I, we just
clicked so good, you know?

33:53.114 --> 33:55.208
But then-
I don't know-

33:55.325 --> 33:57.669
- I was just making small talk,
Sheriff.

33:57.786 --> 34:00.209
I really don't want
to hear about your divorce.

34:00.330 --> 34:02.298
No offense.

34:16.888 --> 34:20.108
- So when did you transfer?

34:20.225 --> 34:21.351
- About a month ago.

34:21.476 --> 34:22.443
So far, so good.

34:22.561 --> 34:24.404
Though,
Mardi Gras has been a trip.

34:24.521 --> 34:25.773
- Fucking Mardi Gras.

34:25.897 --> 34:27.489
It's the worst time of the year
for all of us.

34:27.607 --> 34:28.984
Everyone flocks
to Bourbon Street,

34:29.109 --> 34:31.282
thinking it's gonna be like one
of those Bayou Beaver DVDs.

34:31.402 --> 34:33.076
And instead, they get
toothless 60-year-old women

34:33.196 --> 34:34.322
flashing their sagging pancake-

34:35.782 --> 34:37.625
- Just a bird.

34:37.742 --> 34:38.958
You're really freaked out, huh?

34:39.077 --> 34:41.455
- Yes, I'm really freaked out.

34:41.580 --> 34:42.672
There's a reason
this swamp is condemned

34:42.789 --> 34:44.257
and closed off to the public.

34:44.373 --> 34:46.797
Enough people disappear,
enough bodies pile up,

34:46.918 --> 34:48.465
and eventually,
you can't help but believe

34:48.587 --> 34:51.431
there's some truth to the ghost
stories you hear around here.

34:51.547 --> 34:52.844
I've only been living here
for three years,

34:52.966 --> 34:54.639
and I'm already a believer,
I'll tell you that much.

34:54.759 --> 34:56.011
- Hey, I get it.

34:56.136 --> 34:57.479
I believe in ghosts too.

34:57.596 --> 35:00.475
I swear I saw one in my bedroom
when I was six years old.

35:00.599 --> 35:02.818
But it just smiled at me
and walked out.

35:02.934 --> 35:04.231
<i>It wasn't scary,</i>

35:04.352 --> 35:06.150
kind of peaceful
and comforting.

35:06.271 --> 35:07.818
- This isn't
Casper the Friendly Ghost.

35:07.939 --> 35:09.111
- How do you know?

35:09.232 --> 35:10.449
- 'Cause Casper
doesn't tear you in half

35:10.567 --> 35:12.160
with his bare hands.

35:42.515 --> 35:44.313
- Fucking Christ.

35:54.069 --> 35:56.822
- You still believe
in friendly ghosts?

35:56.946 --> 35:58.448
- What the hell did this?

35:58.573 --> 36:01.417
- Oh, God.

36:01.534 --> 36:02.877
God, we're fucked.
We're fucked.

36:02.994 --> 36:04.211
We're so fucking fucked.
We're-

36:04.329 --> 36:07.048
- Will someone shut Schneiderman
the hell up?

36:10.335 --> 36:13.589
- It's a good thing you got that
girl in custody, huh, Sheriff'?

36:23.932 --> 36:25.229
- Who you calling?

36:25.350 --> 36:26.727
- I'm trying to reach the person
we're going to see,

36:26.851 --> 36:27.727
see if he's home.

36:27.852 --> 36:29.104
- Who we going to see?

36:29.229 --> 36:31.106
- His name's Abbott McMullen.

36:31.231 --> 36:33.450
I did a bunch of interviews
with him a couple years back,

36:33.566 --> 36:35.489
my original Crowley piece.

36:35.610 --> 36:36.611
- Okay.

36:39.572 --> 36:40.994
- What are you doing?
Why are you stopping, Elliot?

36:41.116 --> 36:44.245
- Old Man McMullen?
Abbott McCrazy?

36:44.369 --> 36:45.541
- Yeah.
Your point is?

36:45.662 --> 36:47.790
- We are in some
serious shit here, Amanda.

36:47.914 --> 36:50.542
We have friends in that swamp
that are seriously injured

36:50.667 --> 36:51.793
if not dead.

36:51.918 --> 36:53.966
And I just took our
prime suspect out of jail

36:54.087 --> 36:58.217
against the law
and against my better judgment.

36:58.341 --> 37:00.435
And now you have me out here
on some wild goose chase,

37:00.552 --> 37:01.724
chasing I don't know what

37:01.845 --> 37:05.099
with a more morbid version
of Wednesday Addams

37:05.223 --> 37:06.190
in our backseat,

37:06.307 --> 37:08.401
who could possibly be
a psycho killer.

37:08.518 --> 37:09.940
- Yeah, I'm sitting right here.

37:10.061 --> 37:10.937
- No offense.

37:11.062 --> 37:12.609
- None taken...
asshole.

37:12.731 --> 37:14.654
- Hey, I'm still
an officer of the law,

37:14.774 --> 37:17.448
so watch your mouth before I add
a few more charges to the list.

37:17.569 --> 37:21.073
- Oh, can me telling you
to go fist your own ass

37:21.197 --> 37:22.244
be another one of them charges?

37:22.365 --> 37:23.241
- Okay, see?
That's it.

37:23.366 --> 37:24.413
- Okay, no, no, no.
Stop!

37:24.534 --> 37:25.581
Come on, guys.

37:25.702 --> 37:27.295
Abbott McMullen
is the only living relative

37:27.412 --> 37:28.334
of Thomas Crowley.

37:28.455 --> 37:30.002
Thomas Crowley
is his great uncle.

37:30.123 --> 37:31.170
- And?

37:31.291 --> 37:35.171
- He has Thomas Crowley
on his mantle in an urn.

37:35.295 --> 37:36.467
- So fucking what?

37:36.588 --> 37:38.682
- The only way to give the ghost
of Victor Crowley peace

37:38.798 --> 37:40.766
is to finally give him
what he wants.

37:40.884 --> 37:42.101
- If that's true,
then why didn't you

37:42.218 --> 37:44.141
just bring him Thomas Crowley's
ashes years ago?

37:44.262 --> 37:45.354
- Because I can't.

37:45.472 --> 37:47.270
Only the person
responsible for his death

37:47.390 --> 37:49.643
can finally deliver
what it is he's looking for.

37:49.768 --> 37:51.065
I tried to have
this conversation

37:51.186 --> 37:52.483
with your father two years ago,

37:52.604 --> 37:54.606
and he pulled a gun on me
and told me to go fuck myself.

37:54.731 --> 37:55.607
- Classy family.

37:55.732 --> 37:57.234
- Go fuck yourself.

37:57.358 --> 37:59.406
- Look, I know
how insane this sounds.

37:59.527 --> 38:01.154
But until somebody
has a better idea,

38:01.279 --> 38:02.656
this is the only option
we've got.

38:02.781 --> 38:05.330
So I suggest we stop the
fighting, we start driving,

38:05.450 --> 38:08.624
and we try to put an end to this
once and for all.

38:11.456 --> 38:14.505
Louis is out in that swamp,
your best friend, my husband.

38:14.626 --> 38:16.469
- You mean your ex-husband,
right?

38:18.213 --> 38:22.013
Just drive, please.

38:22.133 --> 38:23.635
- I hate to break it to you
again, lady,

38:23.760 --> 38:25.262
but my father's dead.

38:25.386 --> 38:27.684
- He sure is.

38:27.806 --> 38:29.058
But you're not.

38:45.949 --> 38:49.169
- No way one person
did all this.

38:49.285 --> 38:50.707
- For fuck's sake.

38:50.829 --> 38:52.422
Will you stop dancing around
what's really going on here?

38:52.539 --> 38:54.166
- Shut up, Schneiderman.

38:54.290 --> 38:56.088
- No, sir,
with all due respect,

38:56.209 --> 38:57.426
whether you want
to believe it or not,

38:57.544 --> 39:00.013
this has Victor Crowley
written all fucking over it.

39:00.129 --> 39:01.551
- Control your deputy,
Sergeant.

39:01.673 --> 39:03.425
- Schneiderman, stand down.

39:03.550 --> 39:04.972
- Are you kidding me?

39:05.093 --> 39:07.596
These are somebody's balls.

39:07.720 --> 39:09.768
Balls are not supposed to be
hanging from trees.

39:09.889 --> 39:12.517
Yet, I'm finding myself looking
at fucking balls, sir.

39:13.643 --> 39:14.940
- That guy knows what's up.

39:15.061 --> 39:17.234
We need
to get the fuck out of here

39:17.355 --> 39:19.153
and call the National
fucking Guard or some shit-

39:19.274 --> 39:23.780
- Shut your fucking mouth.

39:26.865 --> 39:32.588
A sick, perverse,
practical fucking joke.

39:32.704 --> 39:35.207
- That doesn't
look like a joke to me.

39:35.331 --> 39:37.174
MY deputy's right.

39:37.292 --> 39:38.965
I'm calling in the military,
and we're leaving.

39:39.085 --> 39:41.179
- Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!

39:41.296 --> 39:42.297
- Hold your fire.
Hold your fire!

39:42.422 --> 39:46.347
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!

39:46.467 --> 39:49.767
Who the hell are you?

39:49.888 --> 39:51.265
- I'm Andrew.

39:51.389 --> 39:54.188
I'm what's left of
the first response team, sir.

39:54.309 --> 39:58.189
Look, we got to get the fuck
out of here right now.

39:58.313 --> 40:00.566
Thank God you guys showed up.

40:00.690 --> 40:01.816
- Why don't you tell me
what happened then?

40:01.941 --> 40:04.114
- What happened?

40:04.235 --> 40:06.579
Fucking Victor Crowley happened,
that's what.

40:06.696 --> 40:09.165
Look around.

40:09.282 --> 40:11.284
- Then why are you still here?

40:11.409 --> 40:14.788
- I hid underneath someone
else's body I found over there.

40:14.913 --> 40:17.291
All right, he massacred
everyone in minutes.

40:18.207 --> 40:19.208
- And you didn't fight back?

40:19.334 --> 40:22.508
- No, I didn't fight back.
I hid.

40:22.629 --> 40:24.723
And that's the only reason
those aren't my balls

40:24.839 --> 40:26.386
hanging from that tree.

40:26.507 --> 40:28.760
Okay, please-
Please.

40:28.885 --> 40:30.933
We need to leave
right this second.

40:34.140 --> 40:35.813
- This is Sheriff Fowler,
Jefferson Parish.

40:35.934 --> 40:39.655
I'm trying to reach Colonel
Mesco, Louisiana National Guard.

40:39.771 --> 40:41.648
<i>- Repeat that, Sheriff Fowler.</i>

40:41.773 --> 40:43.650
- We got a sit-

40:43.775 --> 40:45.152
- Cancel that request.

40:45.276 --> 40:47.153
<i>- Copy that.</i>

40:47.278 --> 40:49.531
- This is SWAT team leader
Tyler Hawes.

40:49.656 --> 40:51.454
The situation's under control.

40:51.574 --> 40:54.828
Cancel that request.

40:54.953 --> 40:56.330
<i>- What's your 20,
Officer Hawes?</i>

40:56.454 --> 40:58.297
- Do not answer that.

41:05.797 --> 41:07.265
All right, everyone listen up.

41:07.382 --> 41:11.182
I will not-and I repeat not-
be losing my job

41:11.302 --> 41:12.770
by calling in
the fucking military

41:12.887 --> 41:16.858
until I figure out what exactly
is fucking going on here.

41:16.975 --> 41:17.851
Do I make myself clear?

41:17.976 --> 41:19.774
All: Yes, sir.

41:19.894 --> 41:21.692
- Is this guy kidding?

41:21.813 --> 41:23.486
- Fuck this shit.

41:23.606 --> 41:26.780
Your ego
is putting all of us in danger.

41:26.901 --> 41:28.278
Fucking fire me.
I don't care.

41:28.403 --> 41:30.701
I'm leaving.

41:30.822 --> 41:32.244
- Officer Schneiderman,

41:32.365 --> 41:33.708
are you aware
of the consequences

41:33.825 --> 41:35.998
for fleeing the scene
of a murder?

41:39.914 --> 41:41.166
- Yep-

41:41.290 --> 41:42.633
But at least I'll be alive.

41:42.750 --> 41:44.969
- Don't do it, Deputy.

41:51.009 --> 41:53.933
- Calm down.

41:54.053 --> 41:55.805
What are you?
Are you scared?

41:55.930 --> 41:58.058
- Yes.
Yes, I'm fucking scared.

41:58.182 --> 42:00.560
How the fuck
are you not scared?

42:00.685 --> 42:01.777
- He's like a tank.

42:01.894 --> 42:03.646
No matter
how many bullets he took,

42:03.771 --> 42:06.365
he just kept
getting back up and coming.

42:06.482 --> 42:07.859
If we don't leave
right this second,

42:07.984 --> 42:10.362
nobody's gonna
be alive tomorrow.

42:14.240 --> 42:15.457
- Then where is he?

42:15.575 --> 42:16.918
- I don't know.

42:17.035 --> 42:19.914
I've been playing dead and
hiding until you guys showed up.

42:20.038 --> 42:25.465
Last I heard was screaming
coming from over there.

42:58.367 --> 43:00.620
- Hold your fire.
Hold your fire.

43:00.745 --> 43:03.999
Hold your...

43:12.006 --> 43:14.475
Go check it out.

43:47.041 --> 43:49.214
We got him.

43:56.926 --> 43:59.770
- Good job, fucktards.

44:06.644 --> 44:08.362
- Oh, my God.

44:08.479 --> 44:10.277
Hide!

44:10.398 --> 44:11.365
Go!
Hide, hide!

44:11.482 --> 44:15.828
- Move.
Move, move!

44:15.945 --> 44:17.868
Go!

44:17.989 --> 44:19.332
" Hey, guys.
Yeah, yeah, guys.

44:19.448 --> 44:21.371
Check this out.
Who wants in on this?

44:21.492 --> 44:23.540
No, no, no.
He lives there.

44:23.661 --> 44:25.834
Stop!

44:25.955 --> 44:27.707
This is not a good place
to hide, okay?

44:27.832 --> 44:31.382
I think he lives here,
so-bushes over here.

44:31.502 --> 44:33.379
Hey, you.
You want to hide in the bush?

44:33.504 --> 44:34.676
- We're so gonna fuckin' die.

44:34.797 --> 44:35.673
<i>We're so gonna fuckin'-</i>

44:35.798 --> 44:38.142
- Shut your fucking mouth.

44:38.259 --> 44:39.511
- Stop!
Guys!

45:04.327 --> 45:07.376
- Oh, shit.
Shit, shit.

45:11.667 --> 45:13.044
- Ugh!

45:24.722 --> 45:25.689
- Stop, stop!

45:25.806 --> 45:26.932
Stop. Don't fire!
Stop!

45:30.561 --> 45:32.188
Help me!
Help!

45:32.313 --> 45:33.405
No!

45:34.565 --> 45:37.239
No, no!
Help!

45:37.360 --> 45:38.612
Help me!
No!

45:43.157 --> 45:44.033
- Move your head.

45:46.244 --> 45:47.291
- Help me!
Thank you!

45:47.411 --> 45:49.789
- I got you.
I got you.

45:55.294 --> 45:57.888
- Move back, move back,
move back, move back.

46:03.803 --> 46:05.225
- Oh, shit.

46:05.346 --> 46:06.598
Oh, shit.

46:16.607 --> 46:17.824
- Fire!

47:11.662 --> 47:12.788
- Ugh!

47:17.126 --> 47:18.799
Help me!

47:24.508 --> 47:29.059
- What the-
What the fuck?

47:29.180 --> 47:31.808
- Get down!

47:49.784 --> 47:52.003
- Ah!

47:52.119 --> 47:54.542
- Ugh.

47:54.663 --> 47:56.415
- Ah!

47:56.540 --> 47:58.542
- Uh!

48:00.920 --> 48:02.046
- Ah!

48:27.196 --> 48:30.075
- No!

48:35.913 --> 48:39.133
- Let's do this,
you little bitch.

48:40.418 --> 48:41.635
- On.

48:56.267 --> 48:58.395
- Oh, fuck this!

49:07.445 --> 49:10.449
- Ah!

49:15.411 --> 49:17.254
- Schneiderman!

49:17.371 --> 49:18.964
- Help!

49:19.081 --> 49:19.957
- Schneiderman, get back!

49:20.082 --> 49:20.958
- You're gonna kill him!

49:21.083 --> 49:21.959
- He's already dead.

49:22.084 --> 49:23.631
- Guy was always
a fucking dick anyways.

49:30.926 --> 49:32.303
- What's up, swamp bitch?

49:32.428 --> 49:33.520
Running around
in your fucking overalls

49:33.637 --> 49:34.854
killing everybody
I fuckin' know.

49:34.972 --> 49:37.475
- Oh, my God!
Please!

49:37.600 --> 49:40.023
Please, God!
Please stop.

49:40.144 --> 49:41.487
- You want your fucking daddy?

49:41.604 --> 49:43.481
I'll give you your fucking
daddy, you deformed douche.

49:45.316 --> 49:46.909
- Sorry, Rick.

49:47.026 --> 49:50.656
Eat this, motherfucker!

49:52.281 --> 49:53.328
- Ugh!

49:55.743 --> 49:56.869
- Ugh!

50:02.833 --> 50:03.709
- Whoo!

50:05.211 --> 50:06.633
Yeah!

50:06.754 --> 50:07.630
Whoo!

50:07.755 --> 50:08.756
You see that?

50:08.881 --> 50:10.053
Now, that's how
you take a bitch out.

50:14.011 --> 50:15.388
<i>' Run!</i>

50:21.352 --> 50:22.228
- Come on!

50:22.353 --> 50:23.229
Back to the boat!

50:23.354 --> 50:24.731
- Come on!

50:24.855 --> 50:25.822
- Get up!

50:28.359 --> 50:30.578
- Ugh!

50:30.694 --> 50:32.321
- Oh, damn it.

50:53.509 --> 50:55.853
Fuck you!

50:56.887 --> 50:59.390
Fuck you!

51:13.404 --> 51:14.280
Oh!

51:14.405 --> 51:16.624
No!

51:59.783 --> 52:01.000
- This is it.

52:01.118 --> 52:02.995
- I spent two days
interviewing Abbott McMullen

52:03.120 --> 52:04.372
for my Crowley story.

52:04.496 --> 52:06.544
You never quite get
the smell out of your sinuses.

52:06.665 --> 52:08.508
- And you think he's just
gonna hand over the ashes

52:08.626 --> 52:10.469
of Thomas Crowley to you?

52:10.586 --> 52:11.838
- No.

52:11.962 --> 52:13.760
But he'll hand 'em over to you.

52:13.881 --> 52:15.098
- Wait.

52:15.215 --> 52:16.558
What?

52:17.301 --> 52:18.644
Stay here.

52:18.761 --> 52:20.934
- Where the fuck am I gonna go?

52:25.768 --> 52:26.690
- Amanda, this is crazy.

52:26.810 --> 52:27.936
You can't do this.

52:28.062 --> 52:29.063
- I tell you something.

52:29.188 --> 52:30.360
By the end of the night,
if I'm wrong,

52:30.481 --> 52:31.903
you can personally
haul my little ass to jail.

52:32.024 --> 52:33.196
- Oh, I intend to.

52:33.317 --> 52:34.569
- 'Cause this is
the last chance we've got

52:34.693 --> 52:35.865
to bring this to an end.

52:35.986 --> 52:37.112
- How?

52:37.237 --> 52:39.990
- That girl
is Samson Dunston's bloodline.

52:45.204 --> 52:47.127
Hey, Mr. McMullen.
Remember me?

52:47.247 --> 52:48.123
- Who are you?

52:48.248 --> 52:49.249
- I'm Amanda Fowler.

52:49.375 --> 52:50.501
- From the paper?

52:50.626 --> 52:52.048
- Yes, sir.

52:52.169 --> 52:53.091
- I ought to shoot you dead

52:53.212 --> 52:55.055
for waking me up
at this crazy hour.

52:55.172 --> 52:57.391
It's the middle of the night,
for Christ sakes.

52:57.508 --> 52:58.384
- It's 8:45.

52:58.509 --> 53:00.511
- Well, that's what I said.

53:03.138 --> 53:04.185
Who is the colored?

53:04.306 --> 53:05.558
- Who's the-

53:05.683 --> 53:07.902
Deputy Winslow,
Jefferson Parish.

53:08.018 --> 53:09.986
And you do know that
the whole Civil Rights thing

53:10.104 --> 53:12.607
did take place, just FYI.

53:12.731 --> 53:14.028
- I didn't do nothing
to that little girl.

53:14.149 --> 53:16.151
There ain't no crime in looking.

53:16.276 --> 53:17.653
- I'm sure you didn't,

53:17.778 --> 53:20.907
not a nice tolerant man
such as yourself.

53:21.031 --> 53:23.079
- This here is harassment.

53:23.200 --> 53:24.577
I'll have your job.

53:24.702 --> 53:25.828
- After tonight?

53:25.953 --> 53:28.081
Yeah, you just might
have my job.

53:28.205 --> 53:30.583
- Mr. McMullen, we just
wanted to visit with you

53:30.708 --> 53:32.927
about a matter
of extreme urgency.

53:33.043 --> 53:33.919
- What?
Was there a fire?

53:34.044 --> 53:35.170
Is Sarah Jane all right?

53:35.295 --> 53:36.797
- She's fine.
She's fine.

53:36.922 --> 53:38.595
We just wanted to have
a minute of your time,

53:38.716 --> 53:40.389
just a minute.

53:45.055 --> 53:47.979
- Well, all I got's a minute.

53:48.100 --> 53:50.569
Got a lot of irons
in the fire, you know.

53:50.686 --> 53:52.529
- Oh, yes, I know.
I know that.

53:52.646 --> 53:55.570
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

53:55.691 --> 53:57.659
- And don't you try
to steal nothing.

53:57.776 --> 54:00.746
I got eyes
in the front of my head.

54:00.863 --> 54:02.206
- Why don't you just offer me

54:02.322 --> 54:03.790
some fried chicken and
watermelon while you're at it?

54:03.907 --> 54:05.875
- I ain't got no food.

54:05.993 --> 54:07.370
- It was a joke.

54:07.494 --> 54:11.124
- You mumble.
I can't understand you people.

54:11.248 --> 54:13.250
- Forget it.
- What?

54:13.375 --> 54:15.343
- Forget it!
- Faggot?

54:15.461 --> 54:18.635
I ain't no faggot.

54:18.756 --> 54:20.724
Oh, well, come on in.

54:27.598 --> 54:30.693
If you're here to talk about
Victor Crowley again,

54:30.809 --> 54:33.858
I told you everything
I had to say yesterday.

54:33.979 --> 54:35.777
- Well, actually, Abbott,
that was ten years ago.

54:35.898 --> 54:37.491
- What?
Speak up.

54:37.608 --> 54:40.157
- Yeah, I'm not here
to talk about Victor Crowley.

54:40.277 --> 54:41.369
- Well, then,
what the hell you want?

54:41.487 --> 54:43.660
- We are here
on official police business.

54:43.781 --> 54:45.499
You've got a piece of evidence

54:45.616 --> 54:47.038
that is part
of our investigation.

54:47.159 --> 54:50.254
We wanted to borrow it and then
bring it right back to you.

54:50.370 --> 54:51.917
- And where is your warrant?

54:52.039 --> 54:53.916
- You're not under arrest.
It's okay.

54:54.041 --> 54:55.839
- You're not in any kind
of trouble, Mr. McMullen.

54:55.959 --> 54:57.211
We just need
to borrow an item from you

54:57.336 --> 54:58.212
and return it to you briefly.

54:58.337 --> 54:59.259
- You know,
you mumble too much.

54:59.379 --> 55:01.802
I can't even understand you.

55:01.924 --> 55:05.053
- Oh, you know,
when last we spoke,

55:05.177 --> 55:07.851
you told me that these
are Thomas Crowley's ashes.

55:07.971 --> 55:08.847
Isn't that right?

55:08.972 --> 55:10.690
- No, them's my uncle's ashes.

55:10.808 --> 55:11.900
- That's right.

55:12.017 --> 55:13.360
These are your uncle's ashes.

55:13.477 --> 55:15.354
- What the hell are you doing,
you little harlot?

55:15.479 --> 55:16.856
- I am just gonna borrow these
for a little bit,

55:16.980 --> 55:17.981
and we're gonna
bring 'em right back.

55:19.733 --> 55:22.282
- Mr. McMullen,
I'm afraid I must insist.

55:22.402 --> 55:25.656
I'll bring your uncle's ashes
back to you personally.

55:25.781 --> 55:27.624
- What the hell you want
with my uncle's ashes anyway?

55:27.741 --> 55:30.290
- I'm taking these as evidence.

55:30.410 --> 55:32.037
This is part
of a police investigation.

55:32.162 --> 55:33.038
Show him your badge.

55:33.163 --> 55:34.130
<i>- Show him my badge?</i>

55:34.248 --> 55:37.548
- Show your badge.

55:37.668 --> 55:40.387
- It's official police business,
sir.

55:40.504 --> 55:41.551
- That's right.

55:41.672 --> 55:42.969
- Who'd you rob this from?

55:43.090 --> 55:44.512
- Who'd I-

55:44.633 --> 55:45.509
You know what?
That's it.

55:45.634 --> 55:47.728
I'm through.
I'm done.

55:47.845 --> 55:49.188
- Abbott, I promise,
we'll be bringing 'em back.

55:49.304 --> 55:51.056
We'll be bringing 'em
right back.

55:51.181 --> 55:53.104
- I said, over my dead body.

55:53.225 --> 55:56.729
- Well, then,
you leave me no choice.

55:56.854 --> 55:57.980
- Go ahead.
Shoot me.

55:58.105 --> 55:58.981
Go on, do it.

55:59.106 --> 56:00.983
Shoot a defenseless old man.

56:01.108 --> 56:03.031
Go on, pull the trigger.

56:03.151 --> 56:06.826
- Abbott, I'm sorry, but we are
leaving now with this urn.

56:06.947 --> 56:07.914
Open the door.

56:08.031 --> 56:08.907
- Do it.
Shoot me.

56:09.032 --> 56:09.908
Go on.
Do it.

56:10.033 --> 56:12.252
Yeah, I knew you was a coward.

56:12.369 --> 56:13.495
You come barging into my house

56:13.620 --> 56:15.839
with some negro thief
claiming to be a cop.

56:15.956 --> 56:17.253
- Fuck it.
Fuck you.

56:17.374 --> 56:19.593
- I am a veteran.

56:19.710 --> 56:21.678
I went all the way to Korea.

56:21.795 --> 56:23.468
- Fucking white people.

56:24.882 --> 56:25.758
- That's right.

56:25.883 --> 56:27.180
Run, boy.

56:27.301 --> 56:28.473
Pow.

56:28.594 --> 56:29.766
Yeah, gotcha.

56:30.470 --> 56:31.596
- Let's get the hell
out of here.

56:31.722 --> 56:33.724
- Is he...
Is he still following us?

56:33.849 --> 56:35.396
Where'd he go?

56:35.517 --> 56:36.939
- Oh, God,
he knocked the wind out of me.

56:37.060 --> 56:38.152
- What are you doing?
No stopping.

56:38.270 --> 56:39.442
Stopping-
Stopping very bad.

56:39.563 --> 56:41.782
Ugh!

56:48.405 --> 56:49.452
- Who the hell was that?

56:49.573 --> 56:50.449
- I don't know.

56:50.574 --> 56:51.791
- Well, he was a paramedic.

56:51.909 --> 56:52.956
Doesn't he work with you?

56:53.076 --> 56:55.454
- Yeah,
but I don't know his name.

56:55.579 --> 56:56.751
- Hey!

56:56.872 --> 56:57.839
We got to get back to the boat.

56:57.956 --> 56:59.754
You're going the wrong way.

56:59.875 --> 57:01.548
- See?
Fuck that guy.

57:01.668 --> 57:02.669
- Well...

57:22.564 --> 57:25.283
You got to be
fucking kidding me.

57:42.250 --> 57:44.503
- You're Samson's bloodline.

57:44.628 --> 57:46.346
You have to be the one
to give the ghost what it wants.

57:46.463 --> 57:47.885
- The fuck I do.

57:48.006 --> 57:49.508
You can't bring me back there.

57:49.633 --> 57:50.976
- We don't have a choice.

57:51.093 --> 57:52.845
The one who caused
the ghost's death

57:52.970 --> 57:54.347
is the only one
who can make it right.

57:54.471 --> 57:56.815
- I had nothing
to do with this.

57:56.932 --> 57:58.149
- But your father did.

57:58.266 --> 58:00.109
I'm sorry, but, Marybeth,
this is the only way

58:00.227 --> 58:01.399
to make it right.

58:01.520 --> 58:03.488
- And why are you just coming up
with this plan tonight?

58:03.605 --> 58:04.527
Why now?

58:04.648 --> 58:05.524
- I told you.

58:05.649 --> 58:06.992
I approached your father
years ago.

58:07.109 --> 58:08.827
It didn't exactly go over well.

58:08.944 --> 58:10.787
And until you waltzed
into the police station

58:10.904 --> 58:12.121
wearing
Victor Crowley's innards,

58:12.239 --> 58:13.661
what proof did I have
that he was real?

58:14.783 --> 58:15.659
Stop!

58:15.784 --> 58:16.785
- You're gonna get us killed.

58:16.910 --> 58:18.662
- Stop it, Marybeth.
Stop!

58:18.787 --> 58:20.414
- Turn the fucking car around.
You can't-

58:20.539 --> 58:21.961
- You have to go, Marybeth.

58:22.082 --> 58:24.176
Only you.
Only you.

58:24.292 --> 58:25.885
You're the one.

58:26.003 --> 58:27.505
- Ugh.

58:27.629 --> 58:28.505
- On.

58:33.135 --> 58:34.011
- Oh, God.

58:34.136 --> 58:35.479
- Come on, man.
Let's go.

58:35.595 --> 58:37.188
- Where's your boat?
- What's wrong with this one?

58:37.305 --> 58:38.181
- I don't have the keys.

58:38.306 --> 58:39.398
- What?
Why?

58:39.516 --> 58:40.893
- I work with a bunch
of redneck racists.

58:41.018 --> 58:41.894
They don't let me
drive anything.

58:42.019 --> 58:43.066
- Christ almighty.

58:43.186 --> 58:45.439
Let's go!

58:46.857 --> 58:47.824
- Fuck it.

58:47.941 --> 58:49.113
- Back in the ambulance.

58:49.234 --> 58:50.110
Move it!

58:57.909 --> 59:00.332
- Shit!

59:03.331 --> 59:05.925
Oh!

59:14.134 --> 59:15.511
- Fuck!

59:21.099 --> 59:23.477
- This is Sheriff Fowler,
Jefferson Parish.

59:23.602 --> 59:24.478
This is Sheriff Fowler.

59:24.603 --> 59:26.446
This is Sheriff Louis Fowler.

59:26.563 --> 59:28.065
God damn!
It's dead.

59:28.190 --> 59:29.066
Does that work?

59:29.191 --> 59:33.617
- Yeah.
- Thank God.

59:33.737 --> 59:36.707
- This is Sheriff Fowler,
Jefferson Parish P.D.

59:36.823 --> 59:38.200
S.O.S.
Repeat, S.O.S.

59:38.325 --> 59:40.043
We are under attack
in Honey Island Swamp.

59:40.160 --> 59:42.629
<i>- This is the National Guard's
frequency, Sheriff Fowler.</i>

59:42.746 --> 59:43.963
<i>Did you say
you're under attack?</i>

59:44.081 --> 59:44.957
- Yes, please.

59:45.082 --> 59:46.959
We need help immediately, okay?

59:47.084 --> 59:50.429
Listen, you got to send military
assistance or something

59:50.545 --> 59:53.094
as soon as possible, okay?

59:53.215 --> 59:54.808
We're pinned down here.

59:54.925 --> 59:56.802
We got SWAT team officers dead.

59:56.927 --> 59:58.770
We got deputies dead.
We got-

59:58.887 --> 01:00:02.482
Fucking half the Louisiana
police department is dead.

01:00:02.599 --> 01:00:05.193
<i>- Who's attacking you, Sheriff?</i>

01:00:10.107 --> 01:00:11.450
- Victor Crowley.

01:00:11.566 --> 01:00:14.570
<i>- Repeat that.</i>

01:00:14.694 --> 01:00:15.695
- Crazed gunmen.

01:00:15.821 --> 01:00:16.947
They're heavily armed,

01:00:17.072 --> 01:00:18.164
and they're firing
everything they got.

01:00:18.281 --> 01:00:19.453
We need military assistance.

01:00:19.574 --> 01:00:20.917
You got to send some kind
of chopper or something,

01:00:21.034 --> 01:00:23.036
airlift us the fuck out of here.

01:00:23.161 --> 01:00:24.333
<i>- Understood, Sheriff.</i>

01:00:24.454 --> 01:00:26.297
<i>We are dispatching
air support immediately.</i>

01:00:26.414 --> 01:00:27.836
<i>What are your coordinates?</i>

01:00:27.958 --> 01:00:29.050
- What the...

01:00:29.167 --> 01:00:31.590
- I ain't got no fucking
coordinates, you moron.

01:00:31.711 --> 01:00:33.384
I'm in Honey Island
fucking Swamp.

01:00:33.505 --> 01:00:34.757
It's not that big.

01:00:34.881 --> 01:00:37.851
You'll see six major league
fucking police boats,

01:00:37.968 --> 01:00:39.436
and they'll be
parked alongside the shore.

01:00:39.553 --> 01:00:40.850
That's where we'll be, okay,

01:00:40.971 --> 01:00:43.349
pinned down in an ambulance
taking heavy fire.

01:00:43.473 --> 01:00:44.565
<i>- We're on our way.</i>

01:00:44.683 --> 01:00:46.276
<i>Hold fight.</i>

01:00:49.813 --> 01:00:51.736
- Finally.

01:00:51.857 --> 01:00:55.077
Fucking finally
something goes right.

01:00:55.193 --> 01:00:56.365
- Wait.

01:00:56.486 --> 01:00:57.362
Be quiet.

01:00:57.487 --> 01:00:58.363
- What?

01:00:58.488 --> 01:01:01.867
- He's gone.

01:01:01.992 --> 01:01:02.993
- Nobody move.

01:01:03.118 --> 01:01:05.120
- Maybe he gave up.

01:01:05.245 --> 01:01:10.718
- Even if he did, nobody steps
outside this fucking boat.

01:01:10.834 --> 01:01:13.212
Nobody touches anything
without my say-so,

01:01:13.336 --> 01:01:14.508
do you understand me?

01:01:14.629 --> 01:01:15.630
- Sounds good.

01:01:30.187 --> 01:01:32.281
- We're staying put

01:01:32.397 --> 01:01:35.367
till the National Guard
gets here.

01:01:38.695 --> 01:01:39.696
- Randy.

01:01:41.448 --> 01:01:43.325
That guy's name was Randy.

01:01:46.536 --> 01:01:48.630
I knew his name.

01:01:54.878 --> 01:01:57.256
- What is that?

01:01:57.380 --> 01:01:58.256
- I don't...

01:01:58.381 --> 01:01:59.928
- Shut up and listen.

01:02:02.719 --> 01:02:04.312
- Where the fuck
did he get a grinder?

01:02:04.429 --> 01:02:05.305
- Oh, shit.

01:02:05.430 --> 01:02:07.478
It's a gas belt sander.

01:02:07.599 --> 01:02:08.942
It was in the evidence pile
outside the boat

01:02:09.059 --> 01:02:10.185
with those other weapons.

01:02:10.310 --> 01:02:13.359
I might've-okay, okay,
okay, I put it there.

01:02:17.067 --> 01:02:18.910
My bad.

01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:38.547
- We really need to call
the Sheriff and let him know-

01:02:38.672 --> 01:02:41.016
- Elliot.
Elliot, no.

01:02:41.132 --> 01:02:42.634
If you do that,
he will order you

01:02:42.759 --> 01:02:43.806
to take me and Marybeth back.

01:02:43.927 --> 01:02:45.600
- Yeah, probably.
- And then what?

01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:46.937
I take full responsibility.

01:02:47.055 --> 01:02:48.022
I'll say I pulled your gun.

01:02:48.139 --> 01:02:49.106
- Yeah, right.

01:02:49.224 --> 01:02:50.225
- I'll do whatever it takes,
Elliot,

01:02:50.350 --> 01:02:51.476
because I am not wrong.

01:02:51.601 --> 01:02:53.729
I am not.

01:02:56.064 --> 01:02:57.691
- I'm sorry.

01:02:57.816 --> 01:02:58.692
- Oh, don't do it, Elliot.

01:02:58.817 --> 01:02:59.693
Please don't do this.

01:02:59.818 --> 01:03:02.162
- Sheriff, you there?

01:03:02.279 --> 01:03:04.782
Lou, come back.

01:03:04.906 --> 01:03:08.035
Louis!

01:03:08.159 --> 01:03:09.957
This is Deputy Winslow.
Heather, are you there?

01:03:10.078 --> 01:03:12.877
<i>- Elliot, where the hell
have you been all night?</i>

01:03:12.998 --> 01:03:14.921
<i>Shit is going down
out at Honey Island.</i>

01:03:15.041 --> 01:03:15.963
- Yeah, I'm aware.

01:03:16.084 --> 01:03:17.586
I'm boarding a boat now.

01:03:17.711 --> 01:03:19.179
<i>- Do you have
the Dunston girl with you?</i>

01:03:19.296 --> 01:03:21.298
<i>Please tell me that isn't true.</i>

01:03:21.423 --> 01:03:22.970
- Look, I can
explain everything.

01:03:23.091 --> 01:03:25.014
Just-when's the last time
you talked to the Sheriff?

01:03:25.135 --> 01:03:26.261
<i>- It's been almost two hours</i>

01:03:26.386 --> 01:03:27.854
<i>since we heard from anyone
out there.</i>

01:03:27.971 --> 01:03:29.439
<i>But the National Guard
received a distress call</i>

01:03:29.556 --> 01:03:31.650
<i>from a paramedic boat,
and they're on their way in.</i>

01:03:31.766 --> 01:03:33.268
<i>What the hell's
happening out there?</i>

01:03:33.393 --> 01:03:35.441
- Look,
who placed a distress call?

01:03:35.562 --> 01:03:38.281
<i>- Why did you take the suspect
out of her cell?</i>

01:03:38.398 --> 01:03:40.867
- Who sent out
the distress call?

01:03:40.984 --> 01:03:42.076
<i>- They said it was the Sheriff.</i>

01:03:42.193 --> 01:03:43.240
<i>He said there's
a group of gunmen</i>

01:03:43.361 --> 01:03:44.613
<i>attacking them or something.</i>

01:03:44.738 --> 01:03:46.581
<i>We can't get a response
from anyone here.</i>

01:03:46.698 --> 01:03:48.450
- Don't you see?
Louis is alive.

01:03:48.575 --> 01:03:49.872
- Yeah, two hours ago.

01:03:49.993 --> 01:03:51.245
- He called in the military.

01:03:51.369 --> 01:03:53.087
He said
it was a group of gunmen.

01:03:53.204 --> 01:03:54.706
Don't you get it?

01:03:54.831 --> 01:03:58.677
He did that so that he would be
sure that they would come.

01:03:58.793 --> 01:04:00.670
What's he gonna say,
"Victor Crowley's attacking us"?

01:04:00.795 --> 01:04:02.217
You got to think about this.

01:04:02.339 --> 01:04:03.556
We have got to get out there.

01:04:03.673 --> 01:04:04.890
And we got to get out there now.

01:04:05.008 --> 01:04:07.557
- And then what?

01:04:07.677 --> 01:04:09.350
- And then we make sure
she puts that monster

01:04:09.471 --> 01:04:12.441
back in his grave,
where he belongs.

01:04:20.398 --> 01:04:21.570
- Oh, shit.

01:04:21.691 --> 01:04:22.692
Should we run for it?

01:04:22.817 --> 01:04:24.239
- Where, back to the woods?

01:04:24.361 --> 01:04:26.238
- No, to his boat.

01:04:26.363 --> 01:04:28.365
While this fucker's distracted
sawing through this wall,

01:04:28.490 --> 01:04:31.084
let's open the door
and run for the other boat.

01:04:31.201 --> 01:04:32.453
- Even if we get a head start,

01:04:32.577 --> 01:04:34.045
there's no way
the three of us make it.

01:04:34.162 --> 01:04:35.414
It's like
he's everywhere at once.

01:04:38.708 --> 01:04:40.051
- What are you doing?

01:04:40.168 --> 01:04:42.091
- I don't know.

01:04:42.212 --> 01:04:43.759
We have to find something
to fight back with.

01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:45.132
- An RPG didn't take him down.

01:04:45.256 --> 01:04:46.599
You think
a couple of needles will?

01:04:46.716 --> 01:04:48.434
- Well, we have to do something.

01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:54.687
- We're running
out of time here.

01:04:54.808 --> 01:04:56.435
What's the ETA on that chopper?

01:04:56.559 --> 01:04:58.152
<i>- Choppers coming in
from Baton Rouge.</i>

01:04:58.269 --> 01:04:59.521
<i>ETA, ten minutes.</i>

01:04:59.646 --> 01:05:01.273
- We ain't got ten!

01:05:03.733 --> 01:05:04.734
Damn it!

01:05:06.528 --> 01:05:08.246
- He must've
chewed through the wiring.

01:05:11.616 --> 01:05:12.492
- Hey, I see the other boats.

01:05:12.617 --> 01:05:13.618
Let's pull around.

01:05:13.743 --> 01:05:14.619
- We don't have time.

01:05:14.744 --> 01:05:16.496
We're close enough.

01:05:19.666 --> 01:05:21.009
- You heard her.
Let's go.

01:05:21.126 --> 01:05:22.002
Let's go.

01:05:22.127 --> 01:05:24.175
- Ugh.

01:05:27.173 --> 01:05:28.925
- Now, listen,
you've got to trust me.

01:05:30.510 --> 01:05:32.604
- Look, I promise,

01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:34.518
I won't let anything
happen to you.

01:05:37.434 --> 01:05:39.152
You know that promise?

01:05:39.269 --> 01:05:40.486
It's fading fast.

01:05:40.603 --> 01:05:42.150
- Come on, get it together.

01:05:42.272 --> 01:05:43.148
- Let's go.

01:05:43.273 --> 01:05:45.071
- Get your hands off me!

01:05:45.191 --> 01:05:46.989
- This will be over soon.

01:05:47.110 --> 01:05:49.829
- Yeah, it will be.

01:05:59.414 --> 01:06:00.415
- Ugh.

01:06:01.666 --> 01:06:03.043
It's got me!
It's got me!

01:06:03.168 --> 01:06:04.886
Get it off!
Get it off!

01:06:05.003 --> 01:06:06.129
Get it off!

01:06:06.254 --> 01:06:08.348
Get him off!

01:06:30.778 --> 01:06:31.574
- Sheriff?

01:06:31.696 --> 01:06:32.948
- Louis?

01:06:33.072 --> 01:06:34.870
Lou!

01:06:34.991 --> 01:06:36.038
- Now what?

01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:39.996
Sheriff?

01:06:40.121 --> 01:06:42.374
- Louis, answer me!

01:06:42.499 --> 01:06:43.716
- They're all dead.

01:06:43.833 --> 01:06:45.050
- He's not dead!

01:06:45.168 --> 01:06:46.169
- He is so dead.

01:06:46.294 --> 01:06:47.386
- No, he isn't.
He called for help.

01:06:47.504 --> 01:06:48.551
He's not dead.

01:06:48.671 --> 01:06:50.048
Here!
- No!

01:06:50.173 --> 01:06:52.096
- Take it.
Take it!

01:06:52.217 --> 01:06:53.810
- Get out of my face, bitch!

01:06:53.927 --> 01:06:56.021
- Take it!

01:06:56.137 --> 01:06:57.514
- Sheriff!

01:07:00.642 --> 01:07:01.768
- Victor?

01:07:01.893 --> 01:07:03.987
Victor, come out!

01:07:04.103 --> 01:07:06.777
Come and get your daddy.

01:07:15.198 --> 01:07:16.415
<i>Victor Crowley!</i>

01:07:16.533 --> 01:07:19.207
<i>Victor Crowley,
we've got your daddy!</i>

01:07:22.539 --> 01:07:23.916
- Why did he stop?

01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:26.668
- Louis?
- Shh!

01:07:26.793 --> 01:07:28.386
I'm trying to listen.

01:07:28.503 --> 01:07:29.595
<i>- Sheriff Fowler!</i>

01:07:29.712 --> 01:07:31.055
- I think it's them.

01:07:31.172 --> 01:07:33.300
- Oh, thank God.

01:07:33.424 --> 01:07:36.473
<i>- Louis, when the hell am you?</i>

01:07:36.594 --> 01:07:37.595
- Amanda?

01:07:40.723 --> 01:07:41.599
- Who's Amanda?

01:07:41.724 --> 01:07:44.819
- Oh, my God.
It's my wife.

01:07:44.936 --> 01:07:47.815
- Okay.

01:07:47.939 --> 01:07:49.156
- Amanda.

01:08:10.086 --> 01:08:11.554
- Oh, my God.

01:08:15.842 --> 01:08:18.970
- Victor!

01:08:19.095 --> 01:08:22.439
You come out here to me
right now.

01:08:22.557 --> 01:08:25.606
I've got something you've been
needing a long time.

01:08:34.736 --> 01:08:36.908
<i>- Sheriff Fowler!</i>

01:08:39.198 --> 01:08:40.950
- Don't even.

01:08:41.658 --> 01:08:44.082
- I still have ammo.

01:08:44.203 --> 01:08:45.170
<i>- Fowler?</i>

01:08:45.287 --> 01:08:48.837
- Just stay put.

01:08:48.957 --> 01:08:49.834
- I can reach it.

01:08:49.959 --> 01:08:51.506
- Stay away from that hole.

01:08:51.627 --> 01:08:53.426
- Shh.

01:08:54.464 --> 01:08:57.684
<i>- Victor, where are you?</i>

01:08:57.800 --> 01:08:58.971
- Okay.

01:08:59.093 --> 01:09:00.560
- Don't.

01:09:00.678 --> 01:09:03.352
Don't-don't-
don't do it.

01:09:03.473 --> 01:09:05.817
<i>- I want to see you.</i>

01:09:12.314 --> 01:09:13.191
- Stop.

01:09:13.316 --> 01:09:15.158
<i>- You come out now!</i>

01:09:28.081 --> 01:09:29.502
- Stop.

01:09:31.876 --> 01:09:34.345
<i>- I got your daddy hem, Victor!</i>

01:09:48.643 --> 01:09:49.519
Ow!

01:09:49.644 --> 01:09:51.772
Andrew, help!

01:10:05.451 --> 01:10:07.453
- Come out!

01:10:07.578 --> 01:10:08.454
Come and get your daddy!

01:10:08.579 --> 01:10:10.081
- This is bullshit.

01:10:10.206 --> 01:10:14.302
Amanda,
we need to find the others.

01:10:14.419 --> 01:10:17.468
- Found 'em.
There you go.

01:10:17.588 --> 01:10:19.932
Look around.

01:10:20.049 --> 01:10:20.925
Victor, come on!

01:10:21.050 --> 01:10:25.100
Where are you?

01:10:25.221 --> 01:10:26.097
- He's...

01:10:26.222 --> 01:10:27.769
He's here.

01:10:29.225 --> 01:10:30.568
- Freeze!

01:10:35.898 --> 01:10:36.774
- Oh, God.

01:10:36.899 --> 01:10:37.946
- On the floor now!

01:10:38.067 --> 01:10:39.159
- Cover her.

01:10:39.277 --> 01:10:41.120
Don't let anything
happen to her.

01:10:44.699 --> 01:10:45.791
- No.
- Only you.

01:10:45.908 --> 01:10:47.160
- No!
- Only you!

01:10:47.285 --> 01:10:49.287
We can't kill him unless
you put it into his hand.

01:10:49.412 --> 01:10:50.664
Go!
You hear me?

01:10:50.788 --> 01:10:53.462
You do it.
You do it.

01:10:53.583 --> 01:10:56.803
Do it.

01:11:01.966 --> 01:11:02.842
- Here.

01:11:02.967 --> 01:11:05.311
- Don't shoot until he has it.

01:11:15.104 --> 01:11:17.232
- Here he is.

01:11:26.115 --> 01:11:29.289
- I'm sorry for what...

01:11:29.410 --> 01:11:32.914
they did to you and...

01:11:33.039 --> 01:11:34.586
I'm sorry.

01:11:38.461 --> 01:11:42.216
And I'm sorry
for what my father did to you.

01:11:56.312 --> 01:11:58.155
- I'm sorry.

01:12:13.955 --> 01:12:16.549
Daddy?

01:12:16.666 --> 01:12:19.636
- Take it.
Take it.

01:12:45.987 --> 01:12:47.785
- Step back, Marybeth.

01:12:47.905 --> 01:12:50.374
I said, step back!

01:12:50.491 --> 01:12:52.084
- Oh, honey.
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.

01:12:52.201 --> 01:12:54.670
I'm so sorry.

01:13:04.797 --> 01:13:07.266
- He's dead.

01:13:12.555 --> 01:13:16.560
- No, Elliot!
No!

01:13:16.684 --> 01:13:18.311
Elliot!
No!

01:13:18.436 --> 01:13:20.029
Give him the ashes.

01:13:22.690 --> 01:13:23.737
Ah!

01:13:29.030 --> 01:13:32.455
I knew you were real.

01:13:35.244 --> 01:13:38.589
- I came to save you.

01:13:54.305 --> 01:13:55.773
Ugh.

01:14:20.790 --> 01:14:22.542
Here's Daddy, motherfucker!

01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:49.698
- Ugh.

01:14:49.819 --> 01:14:50.945
Ah!

01:14:52.238 --> 01:14:53.285
Ugh.

01:15:26.397 --> 01:15:28.525
Got to get up.

01:15:28.649 --> 01:15:29.650
Get up.

01:15:30.234 --> 01:15:31.611
Get up.

01:15:33.612 --> 01:15:34.534
Get up.

01:15:34.655 --> 01:15:37.659
Fucking do it already.

01:15:43.205 --> 01:15:46.755
Just one more time.

01:15:46.876 --> 01:15:47.877
Come on, do it.

01:15:48.836 --> 01:15:49.962
Come on, do it.

01:15:50.087 --> 01:15:52.306
Come on, do it.
Come on, do it.

01:15:52.423 --> 01:15:55.051
Come on, fucking do it already!

01:15:55.176 --> 01:15:59.147
Come on!
Get up!

01:15:59.263 --> 01:16:01.106
Oh, God damn it.

01:16:01.223 --> 01:16:02.099
Do it already.

01:16:02.224 --> 01:16:04.272
Fucking do it already!

01:16:04.393 --> 01:16:07.237
Ugh.

01:16:07.354 --> 01:16:09.072
Fuck it.

01:16:18.991 --> 01:16:20.743
Ugh.

01:16:48.437 --> 01:16:50.110
- Hey!

01:16:50.231 --> 01:16:51.653
Hey!

01:16:51.774 --> 01:16:52.775
Over here!

01:16:53.776 --> 01:16:54.823
I'm here!

01:16:54.944 --> 01:16:57.538
Get me the fuck out of here!

01:16:58.447 --> 01:16:59.539
Help!

01:17:00.533 --> 01:17:01.659
Help!
