WEBVTT

02:14.698 --> 02:16.138
Ha!

02:22.480 --> 02:24.960
Come on. Come on, we gotta go.

02:24.960 --> 02:26.520
Ah!

02:26.520 --> 02:27.760
Come on.

02:27.760 --> 02:29.680
Go!

02:46.520 --> 02:49.400
- Come on. We gotta go.

02:55.840 --> 02:57.600
Come on, let's go. Let's go.

02:57.600 --> 02:59.560
Go on without me.

02:59.800 --> 03:02.360
- Shut up. Come on, please.
- I can't walk.

03:02.360 --> 03:04.440
- No.
- I'll hold 'em off.

03:05.560 --> 03:08.360
- I'm not leaving you here.
- I'm already gone.

03:11.200 --> 03:12.680
I wouldn't.

03:13.240 --> 03:14.960
Oh, there you are.

03:16.840 --> 03:18.880
I was worried sick about ya.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.040
It will be a beautiful wedding.

04:01.480 --> 04:03.000
This was yours, wasn't it?

04:03.400 --> 04:06.200
Mm-hmm, a long time ago.

04:06.200 --> 04:07.400
How was it?

04:09.120 --> 04:10.360
The wedding.

04:11.400 --> 04:15.400
Well... the same as it is
for any respectable woman.

04:16.680 --> 04:18.040
A duty.

04:19.320 --> 04:20.920
My father arranged it.

04:22.280 --> 04:25.280
But I... I was a good wife.

04:26.960 --> 04:28.960
Did what I was told.

04:29.600 --> 04:31.640
And that's what you
want for me and Sarah?

04:33.040 --> 04:34.360
Oh, no.

04:36.560 --> 04:38.200
I want the opposite.

04:40.360 --> 04:43.400
Your daddy forced himself on her.

04:43.800 --> 04:47.680
When she gets here you...
you'll both finally be free.

04:48.680 --> 04:51.200
All the pain your daddy caused.

04:54.960 --> 04:56.480
Free, huh?

04:56.480 --> 04:58.320
Free at last.

06:13.160 --> 06:15.800
Mom started talking a lot
about angels at the end.

06:16.560 --> 06:18.120
She could hear 'em singin'.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.600
I always thought that about
you, showing up when you did.

06:25.920 --> 06:27.680
Like you're the angel of our family.

06:28.400 --> 06:30.040
I'm not an angel.

06:30.840 --> 06:34.640
Well, I hope you are.
For both our sakes.

06:38.840 --> 06:43.840
Lord, please bless and keep
our sister, Dolly Ellis...

06:44.720 --> 06:47.600
...loving wife to John Ellis.

06:48.480 --> 06:52.200
Loving mother to four beautiful sons:

06:52.200 --> 06:57.720
Andrew, Seymour, Phillip, Kevin.

06:58.680 --> 07:02.240
She faced more than
her share of misfortune.

07:02.760 --> 07:05.160
She buried her first born.

07:05.160 --> 07:07.600
She suffered with her illness.

07:07.600 --> 07:11.360
But she never lost her faith. Amen.

07:11.360 --> 07:13.160
Amen.

07:33.480 --> 07:34.680
Hey.

07:35.960 --> 07:37.280
Come on.

07:55.520 --> 07:57.160
Uh... uh!

07:57.160 --> 07:58.800
Hey.

07:59.080 --> 08:01.960
Hey! Stop it.

08:01.960 --> 08:04.560
Hey! He can't take
it anymore, he's hurt.

08:04.560 --> 08:05.600
Let him up.

08:05.600 --> 08:08.440
Don't worry sweetheart, we're here.

08:16.240 --> 08:18.840
What do you want from us?

08:21.400 --> 08:22.960
Whatcha offerin'?

08:40.040 --> 08:42.320
Sarah's not back yet.

08:42.320 --> 08:44.120
Neither is Kevin.

08:44.760 --> 08:45.960
What we gonna do?

08:45.960 --> 08:47.720
I gotta feelin' something happened.

08:50.600 --> 08:53.120
Let's find their tracks
as soon as possible.

09:08.160 --> 09:09.880
Four eggs, right?

09:09.880 --> 09:11.440
Five.

09:13.960 --> 09:15.320
Ma'am?

09:17.640 --> 09:18.920
Speak.

09:18.920 --> 09:23.320
They have the girl. And a Negro boy.

09:25.160 --> 09:26.800
One of the devil's sons.

09:26.800 --> 09:28.400
The younger one.

09:28.400 --> 09:31.040
Now they want a new
price, a new agreement.

09:32.000 --> 09:35.880
If I may say so, ma'am, that weren't
the deal and we could just kill 'em.

09:36.960 --> 09:38.240
Nah...

09:38.240 --> 09:39.880
Tell them I...

09:40.480 --> 09:43.280
I'll pay 30 percent more for the pair.

09:43.960 --> 09:48.040
I'll send him up north, get him
to study and become a good boy.

09:48.040 --> 09:50.080
One more saved from hell.

09:50.960 --> 09:56.800
John losing his sons, one by one,
will make his sick heart bleed.

10:05.560 --> 10:07.440
You think this is the Lady's doin'?

10:07.440 --> 10:09.880
Uh-huh. I'm sure of it.

10:29.120 --> 10:30.800
That's Sarah's horse.

11:18.120 --> 11:21.080
They were hiding out here
and then they got caught.

11:24.920 --> 11:27.000
Whoever took 'em must've
followed the stream

11:27.000 --> 11:28.720
trying to hide their tracks.

11:33.560 --> 11:35.640
I'm guessing three or four.

11:48.720 --> 11:50.160
Look, there.

11:51.960 --> 11:54.320
Well, these should
lead us straight to 'em.

12:09.680 --> 12:13.280
We wouldn't want you starving
to death, now would we?

12:16.960 --> 12:18.440
Hey, good lookin'.

12:21.160 --> 12:24.000
What are you doing? Don't touch him.

12:40.480 --> 12:43.440
Ah! Ah!

12:50.520 --> 12:53.280
I'm gonna untie you now,
but I want you to know,

12:53.280 --> 12:55.960
I got men keeping watch
all around with orders

12:55.960 --> 12:57.880
to shoot anyone who comes out.

12:57.880 --> 12:59.320
You understand?

13:10.920 --> 13:13.920
Come on.

13:17.600 --> 13:19.880
Drink something. Here.

13:22.400 --> 13:24.480
Not too fast. Not too fast.

13:28.800 --> 13:31.000
Here, you gotta eat.

13:36.120 --> 13:37.360
John will come.

13:38.600 --> 13:40.320
- He'll get us outta here.
- Yeah.

13:40.320 --> 13:41.920
I know that.

14:24.120 --> 14:25.400
Belinda.

14:25.760 --> 14:27.280
John?

14:31.080 --> 14:33.000
What are you...

14:33.640 --> 14:35.160
Who's this?

14:35.920 --> 14:37.680
That's my good luck charm.

14:41.680 --> 14:44.000
Belinda, I'm here to see Mr Allen.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.480
You heard?

14:46.480 --> 14:47.800
Yeah.

14:48.520 --> 14:50.160
He know you're coming?

14:53.360 --> 14:55.240
We rode thirty miles.

14:58.680 --> 15:02.320
- Hold on, one minute.
- All right.

15:13.800 --> 15:15.160
Elizabeth.

15:19.200 --> 15:22.440
You're here to, uh... to see him?

15:24.160 --> 15:25.960
I need to ask him something.

15:28.280 --> 15:29.640
It's been a while.

15:30.960 --> 15:32.480
Yeah, it has.

15:35.960 --> 15:37.280
Who is she?

15:39.200 --> 15:40.800
An orphan.

15:42.880 --> 15:45.400
Hello, sweetie. What's your name?

15:47.480 --> 15:49.800
Hasn't said a word since I found her.

15:52.840 --> 15:56.480
Well, she's family now.

16:01.200 --> 16:02.720
I see.

16:05.240 --> 16:06.680
Come on.

16:33.800 --> 16:35.360
Mr Allen?

16:45.920 --> 16:48.240
Mr Allen?

16:55.400 --> 16:56.880
Jonathan?

17:00.200 --> 17:05.120
Mr Allen, I need a favour.

17:07.680 --> 17:11.280
There's a sliver of land on
the north side of your property.

17:13.320 --> 17:17.240
That's good farmland,
gone fallow. I want it.

17:20.280 --> 17:21.840
No.

17:26.160 --> 17:28.040
Nobody's touched that
land in twenty years.

17:28.040 --> 17:31.960
I said no. It's not for you.

17:32.840 --> 17:35.400
After everything, in
all due respect, sir...

17:36.960 --> 17:38.960
...I deserve something.

17:38.960 --> 17:41.400
Nothing's changed for us since the war.

17:41.400 --> 17:44.640
I tried everything I could
before coming here to beg you

17:44.640 --> 17:45.840
for this land.

17:45.840 --> 17:50.480
I need somewhere for me and my family

17:50.480 --> 17:53.040
to finally live in peace.

17:53.760 --> 17:56.840
I loved your mother, you know.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.960
You got a funny way of showing it.

18:06.040 --> 18:10.080
Sending her off with her only
son to another plantation.

18:11.240 --> 18:17.000
Every man's got two
hearts, two heads, two...

18:17.000 --> 18:18.320
...faces.

18:20.360 --> 18:24.280
Sometimes, the weaker one wins out.

18:27.400 --> 18:30.640
I've never been a strong man, Jonathan,

18:33.640 --> 18:37.760
and I made up for it with women,

18:39.520 --> 18:43.480
with drink, with anger.

18:45.520 --> 18:47.200
I ain't no priest.

18:49.480 --> 18:52.040
I can't absolve you of your sins.

18:52.040 --> 18:54.560
Can't absolve your own neither.

18:55.680 --> 18:57.040
My own?

18:59.160 --> 19:01.000
I don't need absolution.

19:04.760 --> 19:08.480
Boy, you're my son.

19:09.800 --> 19:12.040
It's my blood in your veins.

19:15.240 --> 19:18.800
Come on. Let's get outta here.

19:20.960 --> 19:22.560
Where are you going?

19:24.040 --> 19:26.040
You still need that land.

19:29.960 --> 19:33.240
There's a parcel of
land in the south-west.

19:36.320 --> 19:38.440
That's what I want for you.

19:45.760 --> 19:47.120
Come on.

20:16.480 --> 20:18.440
Must be in those tents over there.

20:25.400 --> 20:27.080
Shit, I know that one.

20:28.600 --> 20:32.040
He's part of a gang, worst
sons of bitches I've ever met.

20:36.920 --> 20:38.080
He's the leader?

20:38.080 --> 20:41.400
No, the one with the eye patch
is. That's Leonard Bolton.

20:41.400 --> 20:44.280
- Bolton as in the Bolton gang?
- Yeah, that's right.

20:51.760 --> 20:53.160
That's a lot of men.

20:54.040 --> 20:56.600
There's no way to bust in
there without making a mess.

20:56.600 --> 20:58.600
No, we can't roll in just like that.

20:58.600 --> 21:01.360
We're out gunned, we're out
numbered. It's not gonna happen.

21:01.360 --> 21:03.000
All right, then what's the plan?

21:06.920 --> 21:09.200
I'm gonna go down and
make a better offer.

21:09.680 --> 21:12.280
There's something in the world
he wants more than anything else

21:12.280 --> 21:14.120
and that's me.

21:16.000 --> 21:17.200
Whoo!

21:18.320 --> 21:19.920
Ah!

21:24.640 --> 21:26.320
Well, shit, Django.

21:26.320 --> 21:28.880
Held fast from the jaws of hell.

21:29.280 --> 21:33.160
I've known you for ten minutes
and you're the only one left alive.

21:36.960 --> 21:38.200
White Elk,

21:38.480 --> 21:40.000
you wily bastard,

21:40.600 --> 21:42.560
you never knew what you're gonna get.

21:44.960 --> 21:46.240
Lawrence,

21:47.960 --> 21:51.680
good kid but dumb as a chipped rock.

21:56.040 --> 21:57.560
Peter.

21:58.680 --> 22:03.120
Peter, I've known him
for about seven years.

22:04.840 --> 22:06.360
When I first met him,

22:06.360 --> 22:09.560
he hid behind the door and he
hit me on the head with a shovel.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.080
Rosario, Rosario.

22:23.960 --> 22:26.760
I met him when he got off
the boat in New Orleans

22:26.760 --> 22:28.800
with his fine-ass sister.

22:29.640 --> 22:32.000
Oh, she was a wild card.

22:32.960 --> 22:37.680
She liked being smacked
up, spat on, choked.

22:38.640 --> 22:43.120
One night, things got a
little bit rough, she was gone.

22:45.400 --> 22:47.560
I blamed it on a local drunk.

22:49.680 --> 22:52.200
You gulped that lie
right down, didn't you?

22:53.560 --> 22:56.000
I guess it's 'cause I was all you had.

22:57.240 --> 23:01.000
We got our revenge on that
drunk though, didn't we?

23:03.960 --> 23:06.200
Wake up, shit bird.

23:10.960 --> 23:12.360
Wake up.

23:14.040 --> 23:15.600
Hey there!

23:19.400 --> 23:20.760
Who's talking?

23:20.760 --> 23:22.360
It's an old friend of yours!

23:23.520 --> 23:25.280
You don't sound like a friend.

23:25.640 --> 23:27.320
Oh, Rosario!

23:28.800 --> 23:30.120
Bolton!

23:34.560 --> 23:36.000
Django?

23:36.000 --> 23:37.400
That's right!

23:37.800 --> 23:39.040
It's been a while, Bolton.

23:39.040 --> 23:43.040
If you came to make amends,
well you should know I'm all out.

23:43.040 --> 23:45.080
Kevin, they're here.

23:45.080 --> 23:47.720
Well, I'm not here for that.

23:47.720 --> 23:49.840
I'm here for the hostages you got.

23:50.320 --> 23:52.680
All you have to do is
let 'em go and I'm yours.

23:54.520 --> 23:56.840
- You on your own?
- I am.

23:58.280 --> 24:02.240
Well, you should probably know,
you've got five guns on you.

24:07.480 --> 24:09.480
And I'm ready to take out half of them.

24:12.520 --> 24:14.120
What's in it for you?

24:14.120 --> 24:17.800
Well, let's say I owe someone a favour.

24:17.800 --> 24:20.160
A favour worth dying for, huh?

24:20.160 --> 24:22.640
My life's none of your goddamn business.

24:22.640 --> 24:25.480
But your death is. Am I right?

24:26.120 --> 24:27.640
Me for them.

24:28.520 --> 24:30.080
Why would he do that?

24:32.920 --> 24:34.920
You've got ten seconds.

24:34.920 --> 24:36.920
What happens in ten seconds?

24:37.360 --> 24:38.920
I'll shoot.

24:39.800 --> 24:42.200
- We can kill him anyway.
- Just hold on.

24:42.960 --> 24:44.280
Ten.

24:44.280 --> 24:46.600
- Let him shoot.
- Nine.

24:46.600 --> 24:48.120
Stop counting.

24:48.120 --> 24:49.720
- Eight.
- Leo, what's the point?

24:49.720 --> 24:51.280
I said stop counting!

24:51.280 --> 24:52.560
Seven,

24:53.280 --> 24:54.360
six,

24:55.240 --> 24:56.560
five,

24:57.320 --> 24:58.560
four,

24:59.880 --> 25:03.040
- three...
- All right, all right. It's a deal.

25:03.720 --> 25:05.160
Leo, why?

25:06.040 --> 25:08.400
I just wanna have some fun first.

25:11.400 --> 25:12.720
Go get 'em.

25:12.720 --> 25:14.320
I can't hear you.

25:14.320 --> 25:16.000
I said go get 'em!

25:16.000 --> 25:17.560
That's it.

25:33.680 --> 25:36.040
Two for the price of one, huh?

25:37.120 --> 25:41.760
They walk this way, past
that rock. I'll come forward.

25:41.760 --> 25:45.160
Once they're out of
sight, I'll drop my gun.

25:47.160 --> 25:50.160
Are you sure you don't wanna
check, uh, they're all right?

25:50.160 --> 25:54.760
I told you. They'll be
all right past that rock.

25:54.760 --> 25:56.240
Are you sure?

25:56.240 --> 25:58.880
Well this one looks like
he's in a lot of pain.

25:59.880 --> 26:01.920
Stop!

26:16.320 --> 26:19.440
- Just let 'em go.
- Now, come forward.

26:26.560 --> 26:28.120
Go on!

26:28.920 --> 26:31.000
Come on. Come on.

26:43.760 --> 26:45.320
It's gonna be all right.

26:49.160 --> 26:50.480
Drop your gun.

26:50.480 --> 26:51.840
They're not gone yet.

26:52.200 --> 26:54.440
I said, drop your gun.

26:54.440 --> 26:56.560
As I said, they're not gone yet.

27:00.280 --> 27:01.880
Run!

27:02.560 --> 27:03.920
Come on!

27:08.320 --> 27:10.320
Drop your goddamn gun.

27:15.920 --> 27:18.920
He didn't make it. Should we go in?

27:21.520 --> 27:25.840
No. He said to wait. We wait.

27:29.000 --> 27:31.840
My left eye has been
looking forward to this.

27:37.720 --> 27:39.560
All right?

27:42.400 --> 27:44.560
- Someone else?
- We'll bury them.

27:50.760 --> 27:52.240
Where's my gun?

27:58.880 --> 28:00.480
Why can't we just leave?

28:00.480 --> 28:02.960
What's the matter with you?
Leave them for the birds?

28:02.960 --> 28:04.600
You got no mercy.

28:06.320 --> 28:08.040
Hey, hey, hey!

28:09.320 --> 28:12.040
- What do we got here?
- We're gonna send him to hell.

28:12.040 --> 28:13.760
Hey, he's just a kid.

28:15.280 --> 28:18.040
What about in five years,
huh? What about in ten years?

28:18.040 --> 28:20.840
He'll grow up to be just like
the one that killed Peter.

28:20.840 --> 28:23.440
- He's just a kid.
- These animals...

28:23.440 --> 28:25.960
- Put the gun down and let's go.
- ...are just like the ones...

28:25.960 --> 28:28.040
- Put the gun down.
- ...that killed your daughter...

28:28.040 --> 28:30.640
That's a kid. hat's a
child, do you see that?

28:31.520 --> 28:34.960
Imagine how scared your
kid was, screaming...

28:34.960 --> 28:37.080
They had no mercy for your children...

28:37.080 --> 28:39.680
- Shut up.
- Or your wife.

28:43.280 --> 28:45.120
Hey!

29:11.960 --> 29:15.960
I'm gonna make you suffer
for everything you spared

29:15.960 --> 29:18.560
that kid for, and then some.

29:26.840 --> 29:29.360
He didn't tell you, right?

29:31.360 --> 29:34.120
If I knew a man would of
killed my sister like that,

29:34.120 --> 29:36.680
I wouldn't follow him
around like a puppy.

29:38.800 --> 29:40.160
What did you say?

29:40.600 --> 29:43.840
All I'm saying is, your
sister must've been... Ah!

29:43.840 --> 29:46.400
Don't you dare speak of her.

29:46.960 --> 29:50.280
I was just telling you what I know, man.

29:51.640 --> 29:54.040
What the fuck you know about my sister?

29:54.480 --> 29:56.400
I know what he told me.

29:57.040 --> 29:59.840
They liked each other
and they had some fun.

30:01.640 --> 30:04.280
Apparently, she liked it
rough, is what he said.

30:04.280 --> 30:07.800
And he gave it to her
rough, until he killed her.

30:07.800 --> 30:09.640
- Ask him.
- Shut the fuck up.

30:09.640 --> 30:15.200
He told me when he thought you
were dead. He was confessing.

30:15.200 --> 30:17.040
- Enough.
- That's what he did.

30:17.040 --> 30:18.840
I said, enough.

30:18.840 --> 30:21.280
Hey, wait a minute.

30:21.280 --> 30:22.680
Wait a...

30:22.680 --> 30:24.640
I won't let him spoil
the memory of your sister

30:24.640 --> 30:26.680
with his horseshit for
one more fucking second.

30:26.680 --> 30:29.120
What's the hurry? Don't you
wanna have fun with him anymore?

30:29.120 --> 30:31.480
He doesn't want you to
know the truth, that's it.

30:31.480 --> 30:33.200
I don't even know what
he's talking about.

30:33.200 --> 30:34.800
Yeah, that's what happened.

30:34.800 --> 30:39.320
Y... You killed an innocent old
man and you believed it was him.

30:39.320 --> 30:40.720
Shut up.

30:40.720 --> 30:41.920
Is that true?

30:41.920 --> 30:43.080
He's a liar.

30:43.080 --> 30:45.120
Old man Richard had
nothing to do with that?

30:45.120 --> 30:46.200
Goddamn liar.

30:46.200 --> 30:48.000
That's right, he had
nothing to do with it.

30:48.000 --> 30:49.760
Come on, tell him!

30:50.760 --> 30:55.360
Look at me, Leo. You murdered
my sister, my own blood?

30:58.280 --> 30:59.960
It was an accident.

30:59.960 --> 31:03.600
That's a strange accident.
He choked her to death!

31:04.400 --> 31:06.120
Don't lie to me.

31:07.080 --> 31:09.080
You lied to yourself.

31:11.280 --> 31:13.960
You knew that old man
couldn't hurt anyone.

31:14.800 --> 31:19.040
But you couldn't bear to lose your
only friend in the whole country.

31:20.560 --> 31:24.840
So you did what you had to do, you
believed what you had to believe.

31:25.400 --> 31:26.920
Doesn't matter.

31:27.920 --> 31:29.800
But you're gonna forgive me, huh?

31:31.800 --> 31:33.400
Forgive me, come on.

31:48.520 --> 31:51.560
Oh! Ahh!

31:53.160 --> 31:55.840
I'm gonna hold you tight,

31:55.840 --> 31:57.720
just like I did your sister.

32:34.280 --> 32:37.360
We have to be careful.

32:38.920 --> 32:40.640
There's more men.

32:50.240 --> 32:51.560
Get down!

33:12.960 --> 33:14.560
I think we're safe.

33:22.800 --> 33:24.040
John.

35:32.160 --> 35:33.640
Nothing, ma'am.

35:35.680 --> 35:38.320
I always have to do
everything by myself.

35:52.720 --> 35:54.040
Sarah!

36:08.480 --> 36:11.120
- Welcome back.
- Welcome back, Sarah.

36:11.120 --> 36:12.720
Welcome back, Sarah...

36:12.720 --> 36:14.040
Welcome back, Sarah.

36:16.200 --> 36:17.600
Good to see you again.

37:21.960 --> 37:23.400
What's so funny?

37:25.080 --> 37:27.680
That bastard got me again.

37:29.120 --> 37:31.040
I asked him for farmland.

37:31.680 --> 37:34.960
A place where we can live our
lives without being bothered.

37:34.960 --> 37:38.360
And I just get this
useless piece of dirt.

37:48.480 --> 37:49.800
It's easy to defend.

37:49.800 --> 37:51.160
It's a hole.

37:51.800 --> 37:53.640
The soil ain't even good.

37:57.000 --> 38:00.800
The soil's not so
bad, John. It can work.

38:02.280 --> 38:06.200
I outta ride back there and
choke him to death myself.

38:09.280 --> 38:10.800
I like it.

38:13.800 --> 38:15.200
Did you say something?

38:17.120 --> 38:18.760
I said, I like it.

38:23.360 --> 38:24.960
What is your name?

38:26.360 --> 38:27.880
Sarah.

38:29.280 --> 38:31.040
Sarah Candice Wright.

38:38.640 --> 38:41.560
Well, um... Miss Sarah,

38:43.040 --> 38:44.960
you like this place, huh?

38:44.960 --> 38:46.280
Yeah.

38:47.960 --> 38:51.800
I look at it and I find it special.

38:53.600 --> 38:55.920
Special doesn't grow our food.

38:55.920 --> 38:58.320
Maybe not yet, but...

39:00.040 --> 39:03.880
I look out there and all I see is home.
