00:20.806 --> 00:24.392
[eclectic orchestral theme plays]

02:11.208 --> 02:15.212
I mean, everyone wants to believe
they'd be the hero,

02:15.295 --> 02:18.840
that they'd join the Resistance,
try to kill Hitler.

02:18.924 --> 02:21.134
It's such fucking bullshit.

02:21.218 --> 02:24.387
It's obedience, not resistance.

02:25.430 --> 02:30.060
That's the glue of every country,
every army, every religion in the world.

02:30.143 --> 02:32.062
The fuck are you talking about, Felix?

02:32.145 --> 02:35.356
What do you think?
I'm talking about us.

02:35.440 --> 02:38.735
- I'm talking about our revolution.
- We snatched some rocks.

02:40.237 --> 02:44.616
Mark my words, Wolfie,
this score is going to change our lives.

02:44.699 --> 02:47.702
Not gonna change shit
if we can't sell them.

02:47.786 --> 02:49.746
He's going to buy.

02:49.829 --> 02:52.791
Just relax. Let me do the talking.

02:58.379 --> 03:01.216
- Thank you for waiting.
- [Felix] Not a problem.

03:01.300 --> 03:04.803
It's nice here, but you know
there's a bigger one in Mettre?

03:04.886 --> 03:07.847
- That one smells like piss.
- [Felix chuckles]

03:07.931 --> 03:10.934
The drunks from the park
use it as a toilet.

03:11.017 --> 03:12.144
I like this one better.

03:12.936 --> 03:16.606
Whenever I have a difficult
decision to make, I come here.

03:16.689 --> 03:20.526
This place brings a clarity
to any decision.

03:20.610 --> 03:24.114
- What were you thinking about?
- My mother.

03:24.197 --> 03:27.659
- Did she die in the Holocaust?
- No, she lived.

03:27.742 --> 03:30.912
She fell in love with an Englishman
and ran away with him

03:30.996 --> 03:33.248
against her parents' wishes.

03:34.291 --> 03:38.503
I think how much courage she had
to make that decision.

03:39.296 --> 03:43.342
After the war, she came back
to find her parents, but she never did.

03:44.092 --> 03:46.970
- And she never left Berlin again.
- Mm.

03:48.263 --> 03:52.142
Our existence depends
on sheer implausibility,

03:52.225 --> 03:57.230
which I'm sure is exactly
how your merchandise

03:57.314 --> 04:00.275
found its way into your pocket.

04:01.943 --> 04:03.736
Does that mean you're interested?

04:06.281 --> 04:07.740
I would like to see them.

04:10.202 --> 04:13.330
Please, not here.

04:13.413 --> 04:16.666
Any talk of money
seems unimportant here.

04:22.339 --> 04:23.923
[man] We never discuss money.

04:24.007 --> 04:25.758
We have no interest in money.

04:25.842 --> 04:29.346
All we are interested in
is making sure that you and your son...

04:29.429 --> 04:31.306
- And your daughter.
- ...are happy.

04:31.390 --> 04:33.474
OK, then we are all in accordance with--

04:33.558 --> 04:35.727
Not exactly. Ah.

04:38.897 --> 04:40.732
We have spoken to the priest, uh,

04:40.815 --> 04:43.735
- concerning the, uh--
- Adjustment to the service.

04:43.818 --> 04:46.487
Uh, this is my fault.

04:46.571 --> 04:48.614
I wanted to add an exchange of rings.

04:48.698 --> 04:52.702
Ah, this is a Hindu wedding ceremony.
There are no rings.

04:52.785 --> 04:54.787
- I know.
- [man] There are traditions.

04:54.871 --> 04:58.624
Yes, but we are trying to start them
on a path to the 21st century,

04:58.708 --> 05:00.710
- not the 16th.
- Of course.

05:00.793 --> 05:02.587
And the priest is ready to accommodate.

05:02.670 --> 05:06.549
It's just that with both services,
it appears the ceremony--

05:06.632 --> 05:09.886
- Will be over six hours.
- Six hours?

05:09.969 --> 05:13.056
There are certain shortcuts
that others have preferred.

05:13.139 --> 05:14.182
How short?

05:14.266 --> 05:17.436
It depends entirely on how much
you value the priest conducting it.

05:17.518 --> 05:18.686
How much?

05:18.770 --> 05:21.106
The more you give him,
the shorter the ceremony.

05:21.189 --> 05:23.024
The sooner everyone can get to dancing.

05:23.108 --> 05:27.362
Six hours is the starting point.
Pay him double, out in three.

05:27.446 --> 05:29.906
And how much to not perform it at all?

05:31.491 --> 05:35.245
- You couldn't afford it. [snorting]
- [giggling]

05:36.371 --> 05:37.538
[sighs]

05:40.208 --> 05:42.252
[Rajan] This is important to me.

05:42.335 --> 05:44.629
Married men in India don't wear rings.

05:44.712 --> 05:46.798
There is nothing to show their commitment.

05:48.258 --> 05:49.675
That is why I want one.

05:54.097 --> 05:56.891
I want to remember this night
for the rest of my life,

05:56.975 --> 05:59.269
and I don't want it to be a secret.

06:00.437 --> 06:03.564
I want the whole world to know
I'm bound to this woman.

06:07.819 --> 06:09.404
Now and forever.

06:17.954 --> 06:19.164
[grunts softly]

06:21.500 --> 06:22.875
[sighs]

06:48.067 --> 06:49.777
[mother] I'm so proud of you.

06:52.071 --> 06:54.824
So smart and so strong.

06:57.285 --> 06:59.538
Is that why my father hates me?

07:00.330 --> 07:02.582
He doesn't hate you, my child.

07:02.665 --> 07:04.501
You must never think that.

07:04.584 --> 07:09.297
- He loves you.
- He never came to any of my matches.

07:10.089 --> 07:13.259
He went to all of Joong-Ki's matches.

07:13.343 --> 07:16.513
You cannot be jealous of your brother.

07:17.597 --> 07:22.060
Do not blame him
for how much Father loves him.

07:22.143 --> 07:25.771
It is natural for fathers
to be close to their sons.

07:25.855 --> 07:29.442
He's planning on Joong-Ki
taking over the company.

07:31.694 --> 07:36.575
If I cannot be there
to help Father realize his dream...

07:37.534 --> 07:39.994
you must be there for me.

07:41.996 --> 07:45.500
Please, Sun, take care of your brother.

07:51.005 --> 07:54.300
Do this for me.

08:03.309 --> 08:08.607
[man] We, like these books,
or these diamonds,

08:08.689 --> 08:12.735
have the secrets of our past
hidden inside us.

08:13.736 --> 08:16.406
You think a lot about the past, don't you?

08:17.323 --> 08:20.368
Without the past,
there would be nothing to think about,

08:20.452 --> 08:22.995
let alone someone to think it.

08:24.080 --> 08:25.873
Deep.

08:25.957 --> 08:29.586
You certainly weren't lying.
These are beauties.

08:31.003 --> 08:32.964
Shall I be honest?

08:33.047 --> 08:35.841
I know I was probably
the last on your list.

08:35.925 --> 08:41.139
I'm an outsider to you, but I think I know
where these rocks came from.

08:41.222 --> 08:46.686
Out of Mumbai, I'm guessing, and I know
who's going to come looking for them.

08:46.769 --> 08:51.524
They will not be easy to move,
unless I recut them.

08:51.608 --> 08:55.945
Recut, they will have
a fraction of their worth.

08:57.155 --> 08:59.491
Let's go, Felix.
I knew this was a waste of time.

08:59.574 --> 09:02.910
Hang on. Really?
After we listened to all your bullshit?

09:02.994 --> 09:07.332
If you were listening to my bullshit,
I said it would not be easy.

09:07.415 --> 09:10.335
I didn't say it would not be possible.

09:21.179 --> 09:24.349
I will buy a third of them
and see what I can do.

09:25.266 --> 09:27.185
Half or nothing.

09:27.268 --> 09:32.231
And we both know that you're going
to say yes, because I was listening.

09:33.525 --> 09:35.318
That's what your mother would do.

09:49.832 --> 09:52.585
[sighs] I'm such a bad person.

09:52.669 --> 09:54.879
You spend all your money on my medicine.

09:55.755 --> 09:59.300
- Don't talk like that.
- You would be a success without me.

09:59.384 --> 10:02.178
- You would not have to live here.
- Not listening.

10:03.179 --> 10:04.681
If I wasn't such a bad person,

10:04.764 --> 10:07.808
I'd stop taking my medicine
and let you get on with your life.

10:07.892 --> 10:11.270
This is my life.
This is why we came here.

10:11.354 --> 10:14.649
To make money,
to be happy, to be healthy.

10:14.733 --> 10:18.861
Besides, when I iron my shirt,
it always burns up.

10:18.944 --> 10:22.073
Without you,
I would go into the world naked.

10:23.783 --> 10:25.868
There's still some water left.

10:25.951 --> 10:28.329
I will try and bring some back
before I come home.

10:31.874 --> 10:33.000
I love you.

10:36.421 --> 10:38.172
And don't worry.

10:38.256 --> 10:42.802
I've got a feeling today
is going to be a really good day. Huh?

10:46.889 --> 10:49.183
[overlapping chatter]

10:58.359 --> 11:02.363
Hey! [speaks Swahili]

11:02.447 --> 11:04.198
Ah!

11:04.282 --> 11:10.371
All aboard the Van Damn,
the safest bus in and out of Nai-robbery!

11:10.455 --> 11:12.791
[all cheering]

11:13.666 --> 11:15.543
[speaks Swahili]

11:15.627 --> 11:20.047
- Eh?
- [chatter in Swahili]

11:33.519 --> 11:34.895
The fuck are you doing?

11:36.939 --> 11:39.525
I'm thinking about Katrina Unger.

11:39.609 --> 11:42.027
- What?
- Remember?

11:44.238 --> 11:46.365
The first time I got my dick wet.

11:46.449 --> 11:49.118
She was 16, I was 14.

11:49.201 --> 11:50.703
I'd been dating her for two months,

11:50.787 --> 11:53.289
which back then
seemed like a fucking lifetime,

11:53.372 --> 11:57.794
and I remember thinking
I'd been wasting my time.

11:57.877 --> 12:00.797
Buying her presents,
taking her to the movies.

12:01.422 --> 12:02.923
[mailbox clatters]

12:05.551 --> 12:06.761
But then...

12:07.553 --> 12:13.976
the second I got myself
inside of her... [sighs]

12:17.522 --> 12:21.651
everything...
everything had been worth it.

12:23.653 --> 12:24.654
Hm?

12:26.238 --> 12:27.824
- Know what I did?
- What?

12:27.907 --> 12:34.246
I went out and bought myself
a new pair of shoes. [giggles]

12:34.330 --> 12:37.500
Had to. I couldn't walk
in those old shoes anymore.

12:37.583 --> 12:40.085
From that point on, everything changed.

12:40.169 --> 12:44.382
I mean, I had changed. I was a man!

12:44.465 --> 12:45.717
[unzips bag]

12:50.054 --> 12:51.556
[cheering]

12:51.639 --> 12:53.307
[up-tempo jazz plays]

13:01.273 --> 13:03.275
And right now, I'm thinking...

13:04.944 --> 13:06.696
we need new shoes.

13:10.909 --> 13:15.663
[Jela] Whoo! [whistling]

13:18.290 --> 13:19.876
This is it, Capheus!

13:19.959 --> 13:23.462
You'll never hear me complain
about success, Capheus, never!

13:23.546 --> 13:25.548
- Never!
- My ancestors would haunt me

13:25.631 --> 13:28.843
if I even thought to complain
about having too many passengers.

13:28.927 --> 13:30.636
- Whoo!
- Don't complain, Jela.

13:30.720 --> 13:32.430
- [Jela] Whoo!
- [chuckles]

13:32.513 --> 13:35.474
[whistles] Whoo!

13:35.558 --> 13:40.187
Whoo-hoo! [whistling]

13:40.271 --> 13:43.608
Whoo!

13:43.691 --> 13:48.780
Whoo! Oh, those are my-- Those are
my ancestors reminding me to be grateful,

13:48.863 --> 13:51.657
even when I'm being whipped on the face!

13:51.741 --> 13:53.451
- Whoo! [whistles]
- You are crazy.

13:53.534 --> 13:55.912
Oh, my God!

13:55.995 --> 13:57.747
Oh, my God.

13:58.790 --> 13:59.791
Oh, crap.

14:03.127 --> 14:04.712
You made sure
we had all the permits, eh?

14:04.796 --> 14:08.215
Yeah, we are in total compliance.
Don't worry, it will be over in a minute.

14:12.845 --> 14:14.973
Good day, officers.
I'm sure you'd like to see--

14:15.055 --> 14:17.475
- Shut the fuck up.
- Oh, happy to. Love to.

14:17.558 --> 14:20.561
You know what? Shutting the fuck up
is a specialty of mine, so--

14:20.645 --> 14:21.813
We want Van Damme.

14:25.399 --> 14:26.651
Out.

14:28.193 --> 14:29.862
Out, out, out, out.

14:32.364 --> 14:34.408
- [speaks Swahili]
- Shut up.

14:36.368 --> 14:38.078
- Follow me.
- I don't understand, sir.

14:38.162 --> 14:40.331
- Follow me.
- [speaks Swahili]

14:42.625 --> 14:44.543
[people chattering]

14:46.170 --> 14:47.379
Guys, come on.

14:49.924 --> 14:52.301
It seems he's not coming back.

14:53.845 --> 14:55.638
Van Damme always comes back.

14:57.765 --> 15:00.267
[Capheus speaks indistinctly]

15:02.687 --> 15:05.857
Daniella, I don't think you both
were listening to me.

15:05.940 --> 15:07.859
What I'm saying is that
he came to the set.

15:07.942 --> 15:12.030
- [scoffs] He came to the fucking set.
- The director says he knows him.

15:12.112 --> 15:13.489
Yes, he did.

15:14.699 --> 15:17.493
And what did he say about him?

15:17.576 --> 15:19.537
He said he was a great guy.

15:19.620 --> 15:21.873
[sighs] I'm sorry, Lito.

15:21.956 --> 15:24.083
That doesn't sound like
something he would do.

15:24.166 --> 15:26.711
Well, he did. He did.

15:26.794 --> 15:29.881
I'm telling you, Daniella, over lunch...

15:31.256 --> 15:33.759
he showed me how to cut a man's throat.

15:33.843 --> 15:35.511
He put a knife on my throat.

15:36.470 --> 15:38.806
Now that sounds like
something he would do.

15:39.932 --> 15:42.434
- But now you're home, OK?
- You should have told me.

15:42.518 --> 15:44.186
Taste the ceviche.

15:52.194 --> 15:54.321
Daniella-- Good.

15:54.405 --> 15:55.948
- You're an actor.
- Good?

15:56.032 --> 15:59.827
You understand that this,
you know, set, is--

15:59.911 --> 16:03.163
- It's a sacred space?
- Yes, exactly.

16:03.247 --> 16:06.625
- I thought home was your sacred space.
- It is, Hernando.

16:06.709 --> 16:09.169
But this is where I work
and it's very difficult to concentrate

16:09.253 --> 16:12.256
when you have a knife-wielding
psycho ex-lover stalking you.

16:12.339 --> 16:14.299
- You know, guys?
- Oh, my God.

16:14.383 --> 16:16.635
Yeah, I mean,
it completely freaked me out.

16:16.719 --> 16:18.262
Oh, my God, this is so good.

16:18.345 --> 16:20.639
That's the best ceviche I've ever tasted.

16:20.723 --> 16:23.642
Oy, Hernando,
you have to open a restaurant.

16:23.726 --> 16:25.603
Thank you.

16:25.686 --> 16:29.398
I mean, you are such a good cook.

16:29.481 --> 16:31.609
- [Hernando] I'm gonna tell you my secret.
- It's very tasty.

16:31.692 --> 16:34.028
Actually, this is not, uh, ceviche.

16:35.279 --> 16:37.073
This is actually a mix.

16:40.826 --> 16:43.079
- [chuckles]
- So, here they are.

16:43.913 --> 16:45.372
Yeah, great.

16:45.456 --> 16:49.919
- Um... and I really like those ones, 42.
- Mm-hm.

16:50.002 --> 16:53.213
Und, do you have them in yellow,
something more colorful?

16:53.297 --> 16:55.215
- Yeah, for sure.
- Oh, great.

16:57.384 --> 16:59.011
Wow.

17:04.100 --> 17:05.684
[laughs]

17:06.727 --> 17:09.021
Those are so you, Wolfie.

17:10.272 --> 17:15.861
Maybe too you. You should
try something... a little different.

17:15.945 --> 17:17.279
[scoffs]

17:18.363 --> 17:19.740
I like my shoes.

17:25.704 --> 17:26.956
What the fuck?

17:28.248 --> 17:30.126
- [groans]
- [Felix] What?

17:54.233 --> 17:57.486
[no audible dialogue]

18:41.780 --> 18:44.116
[man] I have seen you before.

18:44.200 --> 18:48.079
- You pray to Ganesha.
- I do.

18:48.162 --> 18:51.123
If these men are allowed
to have their way,

18:51.207 --> 18:54.334
you will never be allowed to pray again.

18:54.418 --> 18:55.920
What?

18:56.003 --> 18:58.589
They want to strip away our traditions.

18:58.672 --> 19:04.887
They are trying to destroy our India
and turn it into America.

19:04.970 --> 19:07.848
- No, that-- That's not true.
- It is.

19:07.932 --> 19:10.434
These are the facts.

19:13.604 --> 19:17.316
They use their evil drug money
to buy politicians,

19:17.399 --> 19:22.321
who are going to outlaw people like us
and temples like this.

19:22.404 --> 19:27.743
We are pledged to come here every day
and pray for their deaths.

19:27.826 --> 19:28.953
Pray with us.

19:29.828 --> 19:34.333
Pray to Ganesha to destroy our enemy
before they destroy us.

19:47.638 --> 19:49.807
So this is the notorious Van Damme.

19:53.936 --> 19:55.771
I'm Silas Kabaka.

19:57.731 --> 19:59.483
I know who you are.

20:01.152 --> 20:03.862
Our reputations precede us.

20:08.742 --> 20:11.453
You did me a great service,
though you may not even know it.

20:13.038 --> 20:16.750
You see, the gang Superpower
had been working for me.

20:16.834 --> 20:19.461
They got it in their heads
they no longer needed me,

20:19.544 --> 20:23.048
and in one afternoon,
you destroyed whatever reputation

20:23.132 --> 20:25.301
they felt they'd been building,

20:25.384 --> 20:29.554
thereby saving me from
the incumbent messiness of betrayal.

20:29.638 --> 20:30.931
So I said to myself,

20:31.015 --> 20:37.104
here is a man that might be capable
of more service to someone like me.

20:37.938 --> 20:42.609
Service that provides the kind of
remuneration that can change a man's life.

20:45.321 --> 20:47.156
Thanks for the offer, but I'm OK.

20:54.372 --> 21:00.585
You may be OK... but I know
this is not true for your mother.

21:04.589 --> 21:08.093
We both know that
she is dying of the virus.

21:08.177 --> 21:11.763
Unless she gets the right medication,
she'll soon be dead.

21:13.765 --> 21:16.768
You know the problem
with buying medicine in this country

21:16.852 --> 21:22.983
is that you never know if what
you're buying is real... or counterfeit.

21:40.459 --> 21:43.212
The doctors assure me that these
will have an immediate impact

21:43.295 --> 21:45.214
on your mother's health.

21:46.757 --> 21:48.633
What do I have to do for them?

21:51.178 --> 21:55.224
All you need to do is protect this bag

21:55.307 --> 22:00.062
and make sure it arrives
at this address by midnight tonight.

22:12.532 --> 22:16.161
Should be a rather simple task
for a man of your abilities, no?

22:31.760 --> 22:34.721
[father] What are you doing
hiding in the dark?

22:34.805 --> 22:36.098
Waiting for you.

22:40.560 --> 22:42.687
I know you've been avoiding me.

22:42.771 --> 22:46.566
Your outburst in front
of my assistant was childish.

22:46.650 --> 22:48.735
I needed to get your attention.

22:49.736 --> 22:51.738
I have been here every night,

22:51.822 --> 22:56.201
negotiating a very important deal
with the Americans.

22:57.786 --> 23:00.372
Put the cigarette out.

23:00.456 --> 23:02.500
You know I hate it when you smoke.

23:16.972 --> 23:19.891
You're too late.

23:19.975 --> 23:21.977
The auditors already know.

23:24.938 --> 23:28.526
Someone in this company
has been deliberately devaluing

23:28.608 --> 23:33.531
certain pharmaceutical stock in order
to move funds from one account to another.

23:33.613 --> 23:37.535
This kind of transaction
happens every day.

23:37.617 --> 23:39.411
That may be...

23:41.663 --> 23:45.501
but this kind of transaction
is called embezzlement.

23:47.252 --> 23:50.130
Someone is going to jail for it.

23:56.261 --> 23:58.972
And I think we both know who.

24:04.769 --> 24:05.937
[classical piano playing]

24:06.021 --> 24:09.608
We want the most
expensive wine you have.

24:09.691 --> 24:12.236
- Felix.
- We have an amazing Bordeaux.

24:12.319 --> 24:15.197
Is it the most expensive?

24:15.280 --> 24:18.617
- Yes, I believe it is.
- Then we'll take it.

24:19.868 --> 24:21.370
One time, just one night,

24:21.453 --> 24:26.458
I want to live like I'm one of them
Arab sheiks or Russian billionaires.

24:26.542 --> 24:29.211
Tonight, I don't want to be
just Felix Bernner.

24:29.294 --> 24:33.632
Tonight, I say, no fucking limits!

24:37.469 --> 24:38.596
Hey.

24:39.804 --> 24:41.139
You all right?

24:44.268 --> 24:45.894
Yeah, sure.

24:45.977 --> 24:47.646
[laughs]

24:49.147 --> 24:51.108
[Dr. Metzger]
I know what you're going through, Nomi.

24:51.191 --> 24:52.443
In just the span of a single day,

24:52.526 --> 24:55.529
you can see how much more damage
the disease has done.

24:55.613 --> 24:58.574
The tissue has nearly completely
merged the hemispheres.

24:58.657 --> 25:02.119
I'm sure the hallucinations
are getting more and more intense.

25:05.330 --> 25:07.916
And I have a feeling that you know
who started that fire.

25:09.585 --> 25:11.420
I don't know anything about that.

25:11.503 --> 25:13.130
Whoever they are, they aren't helping you.

25:14.465 --> 25:18.677
I don't know what they taught you
in med school, but the word "helping"

25:18.760 --> 25:22.347
doesn't mean handcuff people
and chop up their brains.

25:22.431 --> 25:24.141
Michael!

25:25.892 --> 25:28.812
[sighs] Nurse, I was gonna operate
tomorrow morning,

25:28.895 --> 25:31.315
but I don't think Ms. Marks here
can afford to wait.

25:31.398 --> 25:33.775
No, no, no, no.
No, I'm fine. I can wait.

25:33.858 --> 25:37.904
Cancel my rounds. Prep her for surgery.

25:37.988 --> 25:39.698
[woman] Yes, doctor.

25:57.882 --> 26:00.594
Sorry, lady, this is a private club.

26:00.678 --> 26:04.431
I don't want to cause a scene.
I know this is a sex club.

26:04.515 --> 26:07.309
No chicks but naked chicks.

26:09.269 --> 26:12.439
My brother's in there
and I need him to come with me.

26:13.148 --> 26:14.149
Ain't gonna happen.

26:17.068 --> 26:18.778
Fuck off. [cries out]

26:18.862 --> 26:20.698
[grunting]

26:23.241 --> 26:26.495
[♪ Lykke Li: "Get Some"]

26:42.010 --> 26:43.970
[no audible dialogue]

27:05.409 --> 27:07.160
[man] Hey, you OK?

27:12.290 --> 27:14.459
You can wait here, Officer Gorski.

27:14.543 --> 27:16.253
I'll go get Lieutenant Duncan.

27:26.430 --> 27:28.348
[overlapping chatter]

27:33.103 --> 27:35.355
[loud chattering]

27:35.439 --> 27:38.233
[women] Whoo!

27:46.116 --> 27:47.909
[chatter stops]

27:49.536 --> 27:51.288
Come with me.

27:51.996 --> 27:53.290
[scoffs]

27:53.957 --> 27:58.336
It's OK.
This is my big sister, everyone.

27:58.420 --> 28:01.047
- [man 1] Hi.
- [man 2] Hi, sister.

28:01.131 --> 28:03.717
[Joong-Ki] She doesn't mean
to make an ass out of herself.

28:03.801 --> 28:06.928
She just can't seem to help it. [chuckles]

28:07.011 --> 28:08.888
Father needs to talk to you.

28:08.972 --> 28:11.475
Are you fucking kidding?

28:11.558 --> 28:15.937
- I'll see him tomorrow.
- No. He's waiting.

28:16.020 --> 28:18.690
- In the middle of something important--
- Joong-Ki!

28:21.443 --> 28:22.861
[thudding]

28:22.944 --> 28:24.446
Now.

28:29.909 --> 28:32.496
[man laughing]

28:34.790 --> 28:37.709
Will! So good to see you.

28:39.002 --> 28:40.128
Did you have to wait long?

28:40.211 --> 28:42.506
[speaks in Korean]
No, no. It's good to see you.

28:42.589 --> 28:44.633
I didn't know you spoke Korean.

28:44.716 --> 28:46.217
What?

28:46.301 --> 28:49.262
[speaks in Korean]
You honor us with your presence.

28:49.680 --> 28:53.183
[continues in Korean] Though your wife
is a cock sucking whore. [chortles]

28:53.266 --> 28:55.226
Hapkido. Black belt.

28:55.310 --> 28:59.731
Thirteen years. My sensei had
the foulest mouth in the entire Midwest.

29:00.816 --> 29:02.776
- How's your dad?
- He's doin' good.

29:02.860 --> 29:05.028
I haven't seen him
since the retirement party.

29:05.111 --> 29:07.698
I don't think I've ever seen
so many shitfaced cops

29:07.781 --> 29:10.534
from so many precincts in one bar.

29:10.617 --> 29:12.577
Your dad was a legend.

29:15.079 --> 29:19.376
Is. Is a legend. Sorry, Will.

29:20.460 --> 29:22.880
So, uh, what can I do you for?

29:22.962 --> 29:25.423
Uh, it's about that perp I brought in,
Jonas Maliki.

29:25.507 --> 29:26.633
What about him?

29:27.384 --> 29:29.344
Was just hoping I could ask him
a few questions.

29:29.427 --> 29:30.804
Ah, sorry, Will, no can do.

29:30.888 --> 29:33.891
It's federal.
You know how those guys are.

29:33.932 --> 29:36.434
We're only holdin' him here
until he's transferred.

29:36.518 --> 29:38.854
You should've called first.
It would've saved you a trip.

29:38.937 --> 29:41.398
All I need is five minutes with him.
Family friend here.

29:41.481 --> 29:43.734
This is a personal favor.

29:43.817 --> 29:47.195
This look like a place
that gives a shit about personal favors?

29:47.863 --> 29:50.574
I'm sorry, Will, but rules are rules.

29:51.783 --> 29:53.702
Give my best to your dad.

29:53.785 --> 29:55.704
I'll send Greg to take you out.

30:00.041 --> 30:01.125
Damn it!

30:13.179 --> 30:14.347
[Jonas] Will.

30:29.780 --> 30:32.031
You're here.

30:32.115 --> 30:35.702
- I can feel you.
- Yes, you can.

30:35.786 --> 30:38.956
But you're not really here, are you?

30:39.038 --> 30:40.164
No.

30:41.249 --> 30:43.376
I'm in solitary confinement.

30:49.925 --> 30:51.802
Angel called it "visiting."

30:51.885 --> 30:55.973
Members of a cluster do it instinctively
and others, like us, outside the cluster,

30:56.055 --> 30:59.684
can visit if they've made visual contact,
eye-to-eye.

31:07.859 --> 31:09.611
This is cold.

31:09.694 --> 31:12.030
How can I feel this unless I'm here?

31:12.113 --> 31:13.991
Because I feel it.

31:16.994 --> 31:18.620
No, this doesn't make sense.

31:18.703 --> 31:22.332
- You just spoke Korean, Will.
- I can't speak Korean.

31:22.415 --> 31:24.584
Yes, you can,
and when you get it, you will.

31:24.668 --> 31:25.919
Get what?

31:26.003 --> 31:28.630
You are no longer just you.

31:30.131 --> 31:32.801
Mr. Gorski?
Will you come with me, please?

31:42.811 --> 31:43.937
[Joong-Ki] OK.

31:44.021 --> 31:47.273
[chuckles] It was so dramatic, Dad.

31:48.399 --> 31:51.778
Sun made an absolute spectacle of herself.

31:51.862 --> 31:54.906
- Really embarrassed me and--
- [father] Shut the hell up!

31:56.115 --> 31:59.410
Do you have no idea what you have done?

32:04.123 --> 32:06.417
What are you talking about?

32:07.669 --> 32:09.046
Do you think I am so stupid

32:09.128 --> 32:13.132
that I don't know when
someone is stealing from me?

32:13.216 --> 32:15.010
Stealing from my clients?!

32:17.512 --> 32:23.852
Tomorrow the authorities are going
to come here and confiscate our records.

32:23.935 --> 32:28.523
And your face,
the face of our company...

32:30.525 --> 32:35.154
will be in every newspaper,
on every news program,

32:35.238 --> 32:41.995
and everything I have built
over the past 40 years will be gone.

32:44.163 --> 32:45.999
[softly] Do you understand?

32:47.042 --> 32:49.627
[shouts] Do you understand?

32:51.671 --> 32:53.590
They are going to arrest you.

32:55.258 --> 32:57.468
[voice quavering] Oh, my God.

33:00.346 --> 33:02.265
You taught me how to bend the rules.

33:02.348 --> 33:04.976
Bend them, not break them.

33:05.060 --> 33:07.062
This isn't all my fault!

33:08.521 --> 33:11.357
Other people were involved.
It's not just me.

33:13.151 --> 33:16.905
Please, Dad, I can't go to prison.

33:16.988 --> 33:18.823
I'll do anything.

33:18.907 --> 33:24.203
Even now...
you don't know how to act like a man.

33:27.832 --> 33:31.461
What do you want me to do?
Kill myself?

33:31.544 --> 33:36.174
I want you to think of someone
other than yourself.

33:36.257 --> 33:41.805
For you, this is impossible,
and it's my fault.

33:41.888 --> 33:43.389
I spoiled you.

33:43.473 --> 33:46.893
I raised you, and I failed.

33:48.895 --> 33:53.817
My wife, God rest her beautiful soul,

33:53.900 --> 33:56.111
raised the one child

33:56.194 --> 34:01.866
capable of seeing the only way
out of this disaster.

34:05.411 --> 34:06.746
[sighs]

34:08.999 --> 34:10.458
What?

34:10.541 --> 34:12.919
Did you say a way out?

34:14.545 --> 34:18.508
Sun. Sun has a way out?

34:20.384 --> 34:21.845
[scoffs softly]

34:26.474 --> 34:30.436
Because Father rarely even admits
he has a daughter...

34:31.771 --> 34:35.608
because no one knows who I am
or what I do at this company,

34:35.692 --> 34:39.487
if I confess to your crime,

34:39.570 --> 34:43.616
the company may be able
to survive the scandal.

34:44.951 --> 34:46.327
[Joong-Ki gasps]

34:46.410 --> 34:48.454
Oh, my God.

34:51.833 --> 34:55.879
Sun... you can save us?

34:57.130 --> 34:59.549
Please, Sun.

35:02.635 --> 35:05.972
[sobs] Please save me. Please, Sun.

35:08.683 --> 35:11.269
Please, save me. Please.

35:13.771 --> 35:15.982
[Joong-Ki sobs]

35:36.961 --> 35:38.213
[whispers] Jonas?

35:39.923 --> 35:41.966
- Will.
- [gasps] The fuck?

35:42.050 --> 35:43.760
We don't have much time.

35:43.843 --> 35:45.386
I tried to contact you.

35:45.469 --> 35:48.223
Visiting is not calling
or texting someone.

35:48.306 --> 35:52.435
It's not something you make happen.
It is something you let happen.

35:53.603 --> 35:55.897
It took me quite some time
to understand the difference.

35:55.980 --> 35:57.899
I'm hoping it won't take you as long.

35:58.608 --> 36:01.278
You also have to learn the difference
between "visiting" and "sharing."

36:01.360 --> 36:03.321
Visiting is what we're doing now.

36:03.404 --> 36:06.490
Sharing is something
you can only do inside your cluster,

36:06.574 --> 36:10.078
accessing each other's knowledge,
language, skill--

36:10.161 --> 36:12.455
- What's a cluster?
- You have seven other selves now,

36:12.538 --> 36:14.707
