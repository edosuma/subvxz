Okay, I hope

00:03.671 --> 00:05.255
I have everything.

00:05.297 --> 00:09.760
So, it's a salsa,

00:05.297 --> 00:09.760
chips, uh... napkins.

00:05.297 --> 00:09.760
Okay. Two-ply.

00:09.802 --> 00:11.470
Maybe medium salsa

00:09.802 --> 00:11.470
is too spicy?

00:11.512 --> 00:12.680
You want to use

00:11.512 --> 00:12.680
Express Check-out?

00:12.721 --> 00:13.931
Yes, please.

00:13.973 --> 00:15.474
-You have Express Check-out?

00:13.973 --> 00:15.474
-[Appa] Yeah.

00:15.516 --> 00:16.934
Two item or less.

00:18.644 --> 00:20.646
Well, that doesn't seem fair.

00:20.688 --> 00:22.898
-Come through

00:20.688 --> 00:22.898
to Express, please.

00:20.688 --> 00:22.898
-Thank you.

00:22.940 --> 00:24.399
I was here first.

00:24.441 --> 00:26.151

Oh! Come through

00:28.320 --> 00:31.072
to Express, please.

00:31.114 --> 00:32.240
I don't have anything yet.

00:32.282 --> 00:33.575
Ah, it's okay.

00:33.617 --> 00:35.035
This seems very arbitrary.

00:35.076 --> 00:37.746
I say two item or less.

00:35.076 --> 00:37.746
She have less than two.

00:37.788 --> 00:40.499
-She has no items.

00:37.788 --> 00:40.499
-Yeah. Less than two.

00:41.583 --> 00:44.586
Mr. Kim, why do you

00:41.583 --> 00:44.586
do this to me?

00:44.628 --> 00:46.087
I'm a good person.

00:46.129 --> 00:48.716
This is a convenience store.

00:48.757 --> 00:51.343
You take so long time,

00:48.757 --> 00:51.343
it's inconvenient.

00:51.385 --> 00:52.678
Okay, fine!

00:52.720 --> 00:55.890
Okay, today I will be

00:52.720 --> 00:55.890
a medium salsa person.

00:56.139 --> 00:57.224
Okay.

00:57.265 --> 00:59.100
[woman] So just the milk.

00:59.142 --> 01:00.310
And gum.

01:00.352 --> 01:02.103
Excuse me, okay?

01:00.352 --> 01:02.103
But I just need...

01:02.145 --> 01:03.188
Uh-uh-uh... Sorry.

[upbeat music playing]

01:32.175 --> 01:34.011
So? What do we

01:32.175 --> 01:34.011
wear on Thursday?

01:34.053 --> 01:36.095
Are you still not telling me

01:34.053 --> 01:36.095
where we're going?

01:36.137 --> 01:38.265
Wear whatever you want.

01:36.137 --> 01:38.265
It's Blake Tavern.

01:38.306 --> 01:39.600
Gerald! Seriously?

01:39.641 --> 01:40.935
Oh, yeah.

01:39.641 --> 01:40.935
There's no dress code.

01:40.976 --> 01:43.854
-Gerald!

01:40.976 --> 01:43.854
-What?

01:43.896 --> 01:46.147
You're going for nachos.

01:43.896 --> 01:46.147
What's the big deal?

01:46.189 --> 01:47.900
Oh, my God.

01:46.189 --> 01:47.900
It's a surprise!

01:47.942 --> 01:49.109
[chuckles sheepishly]

01:49.150 --> 01:51.737
So, the Blake. Cool.

01:51.779 --> 01:54.865
It was just where

01:51.779 --> 01:54.865
we were starting the night.

01:51.779 --> 01:54.865
Or ending.

01:54.907 --> 01:58.201
-It's your birthday, your call.

01:54.907 --> 01:58.201
-I like the Blake. Really fun.

01:58.243 --> 01:59.912
Great save, Gerald.

01:59.954 --> 02:01.956
Hey, didn't mean to eavesdrop,

02:01.997 --> 02:04.583
but my family has a membership

02:01.997 --> 02:04.583
at the Stonewood Supper Club.

02:04.625 --> 02:06.167
Chelsea, you're bragging again.

02:06.209 --> 02:09.379
[chuckles] No!

02:06.209 --> 02:09.379
They should go there.

02:06.209 --> 02:09.379
They can be my guests.

02:09.421 --> 02:11.506
-Really?

-Sweet!

Chungalo! [chuckles]

02:41.120 --> 02:43.455
Trying that one out.

02:41.120 --> 02:43.455
Didn't look good.

02:43.497 --> 02:45.958
Kimch, ready for

02:43.497 --> 02:45.958
a life-changing experience?

02:46.000 --> 02:47.459
You found my dad?

02:47.501 --> 02:50.211
-Uh, you're traveling to India?

02:47.501 --> 02:50.211
-[Jung] Even better.

-Boom!

02:53.465 --> 02:55.634
-[Shannon] Get out!

02:55.676 --> 02:58.219
I would die to skydive

02:55.676 --> 02:58.219
this weekend.

02:58.261 --> 03:01.222
Sure, there are risks.

02:58.261 --> 03:01.222
Twenty people die every year.

03:01.264 --> 03:04.225
Some from impact,

03:01.264 --> 03:04.225
others shredded

03:01.264 --> 03:04.225
in the propeller,

03:04.267 --> 03:06.394
but, so worth it. So fun.

03:06.436 --> 03:09.356
Look, normally, I'd be

03:06.436 --> 03:09.356
all over jumping out

03:06.436 --> 03:09.356
of a moving airplane,

03:09.397 --> 03:13.192
but I got a frisbee game.

03:09.397 --> 03:13.192
Ultimate frisbee.

03:13.234 --> 03:14.569
Come on, man!

03:13.234 --> 03:14.569
You just made that up.

03:14.611 --> 03:16.989
Yeah. I would have said

03:14.611 --> 03:16.989
I had a family thing.

03:17.031 --> 03:18.239
Okay, so do you wanna go?

03:18.281 --> 03:19.992
No, I actually do

03:18.281 --> 03:19.992
have a family thing.

03:20.034 --> 03:22.243
[sighs] Come on, Kimch!

03:20.034 --> 03:22.243
It'll be great.

03:22.285 --> 03:24.412
nothing around you but sky!

03:24.454 --> 03:26.373
And planet Earth

03:24.454 --> 03:26.373
is just rushing towards you

03:26.414 --> 03:27.624
and there's this

03:26.414 --> 03:27.624
tiny part of you

03:27.666 --> 03:29.459
that doesn't want

03:27.666 --> 03:29.459
to pull the cord.

03:29.501 --> 03:30.961
We're definitely

03:29.501 --> 03:30.961
gonna pull the cord.

03:31.003 --> 03:32.629
Obvi.

03:32.671 --> 03:35.465
And it sounds like fun,

03:32.671 --> 03:35.465
but I can't let

03:32.671 --> 03:35.465
the Ultimate team down.

You're missing out.

03:38.218 --> 03:40.804
you scream from your gut

03:40.846 --> 03:45.142
like a warrior who's just

03:40.846 --> 03:45.142
slaughtered her enemies.

03:52.149 --> 03:54.068
and grab some snacks?

03:54.109 --> 03:55.276

Well, actually

03:55.318 --> 03:57.071
it's for boardgame night.

03:57.112 --> 03:59.364

03:59.406 --> 04:02.576
-Why you do like that?

03:59.406 --> 04:02.576
So embarrassing.

04:02.617 --> 04:05.286
I know, but I just don't

04:02.617 --> 04:05.286
see these guys very often.

04:05.328 --> 04:07.414
Oh, hi, Gerald.

04:05.328 --> 04:07.414
No, I talking to him.

04:07.455 --> 04:09.833
I hate when he using

04:07.455 --> 04:09.833
dirty pig spoon.

04:09.875 --> 04:13.170
Oh, not dirty pig spoon.

04:09.875 --> 04:13.170
Clean army spoon.

04:13.212 --> 04:14.337
It's actually kind of dirty.

04:14.379 --> 04:17.716
Yeah. Been through a lot.

04:14.379 --> 04:17.716
Two year Korean army.

04:17.758 --> 04:19.176
You were in the army?

04:19.218 --> 04:20.301
Yeah. Trained to fight.

04:20.343 --> 04:22.262
And to clean up garbage

04:20.343 --> 04:22.262
at side of road.

-[Appa sighs]

-Cool.

04:23.471 --> 04:26.307
Not cool. Very hot.

04:23.471 --> 04:26.307
And dangerous.

Always fighting

04:26.349 --> 04:28.435
to survive, hmm?

04:28.476 --> 04:31.855
One time, whole platoon

04:28.476 --> 04:31.855
is just so hungry.

04:31.897 --> 04:37.318
Ration finish.

04:31.897 --> 04:37.318
No meat. No fruit.

04:31.897 --> 04:37.318
Only gum and mint toothpick.

04:37.360 --> 04:39.320
We'd all left to die.

04:39.362 --> 04:40.739
[Umma] Yeah, yeah.

04:40.781 --> 04:44.534
You find pig, catch pig,

04:40.781 --> 04:44.534
everybody live.

04:40.781 --> 04:44.534
Okay, see you!

04:44.576 --> 04:48.329
So, like I say,

04:44.576 --> 04:48.329
giant wild boar--

04:48.371 --> 04:49.957
You weren't saying that.

04:49.998 --> 04:53.127
Running this way and that way

04:49.998 --> 04:53.127
and it's very dangerous, hmm?

04:53.168 --> 04:58.298
So, we slowly surround

04:53.168 --> 04:58.298
big, wild boar and then...

04:58.339 --> 05:00.634
[imitating gunfire]

05:00.675 --> 05:02.177
Was that Russians?

05:00.675 --> 05:02.177
Or Chinese?

05:02.219 --> 05:05.346
Running and chasing

05:02.219 --> 05:05.346
and people still shooting,

05:05.388 --> 05:07.682
but, you know,

05:05.388 --> 05:07.682
we just so hungry!

05:07.724 --> 05:10.518
And then I see

05:07.724 --> 05:10.518
hole in the ground

05:07.724 --> 05:10.518
for army bathroom.

05:10.560 --> 05:15.065
So I jump onto pig

05:10.560 --> 05:15.065
and drive all around

05:10.560 --> 05:15.065
and into hole.

05:15.107 --> 05:16.275
Into the latrine?

05:16.316 --> 05:18.318
And then at the last second,

05:16.316 --> 05:18.318
I jump off!

05:19.861 --> 05:22.072
-That's amazing!

05:19.861 --> 05:22.072
-Not finished yet!

05:22.114 --> 05:23.949
Pig still in hole.

05:23.991 --> 05:29.079
So I get a rope, like a cowboy,

05:23.991 --> 05:29.079
and I catch a big wild boar,

05:23.991 --> 05:29.079
and then...

05:29.121 --> 05:30.622
Don't say you ate it.

05:31.873 --> 05:33.750
With this spoon.

05:35.418 --> 05:36.544
[slurps loudly]

05:36.586 --> 05:40.381
That's incredible.

05:36.586 --> 05:40.381
Also, kind of disgusting.

05:40.423 --> 05:42.383
That's hard Korea army life.

05:42.425 --> 05:43.969
Actually, this is

05:42.425 --> 05:43.969
kind of perfect.

05:44.011 --> 05:45.386
Do you mind if I take a picture?

05:45.428 --> 05:46.638
Why?

05:46.680 --> 05:49.224
It's not every day you hear

05:46.680 --> 05:49.224
a war story first-hand.

05:49.266 --> 05:52.311
Not so much a war story,

05:49.266 --> 05:52.311
more like a army story.

05:52.351 --> 05:56.397
Well, I have a photo essay due,

05:52.351 --> 05:56.397
and I just met

05:52.351 --> 05:56.397
a genuine war hero.

05:56.439 --> 06:02.487
Gerald, you know that

05:56.439 --> 06:02.487
the Korea War is finish

05:56.439 --> 06:02.487
in 1953, right?

06:02.529 --> 06:04.447
Thanks to people

06:02.529 --> 06:04.447
like you, Mr. Kim.

06:05.448 --> 06:07.408
[sighs] Okay.

06:07.450 --> 06:08.743
[camera shutter clicks]

06:08.785 --> 06:10.411
[laughter]

06:10.453 --> 06:13.290
I know! Mr. Sherman's

06:10.453 --> 06:13.290
a great teacher,

06:10.453 --> 06:13.290
but then he's like,

06:13.332 --> 06:14.582
"Janet, I know you hate me.

06:14.624 --> 06:16.584
[all laughing]

06:16.626 --> 06:19.420
I just want to let you know

06:16.626 --> 06:19.420
I'm having a showing.

06:19.462 --> 06:22.883
I want you to come,

06:19.462 --> 06:22.883
so my mother thinks

06:19.462 --> 06:22.883
I'm popular.

06:22.924 --> 06:24.383
And open to diversity."

06:26.011 --> 06:27.721
Oh, my God. That is so him!

06:27.762 --> 06:30.431
That's hilarious.

06:27.762 --> 06:30.431
You guys want

06:27.762 --> 06:30.431
another bottle?

06:30.473 --> 06:32.433
I think I'm good.

06:32.475 --> 06:33.977
Yeah. I should

06:32.475 --> 06:33.977
probably switch to coffee.

06:34.019 --> 06:35.436

13:21.259 --> 13:24.387
they were both black.

13:21.259 --> 13:24.387
They looked a lot alike.

13:24.429 --> 13:27.557
And how many times

13:24.429 --> 13:27.557
have I been mistaken

13:24.429 --> 13:27.557
for a different Asian girl?

13:27.599 --> 13:28.807
How many?

13:29.892 --> 13:31.852
Well, it's not how many times,

13:31.894 --> 13:34.897
it's that you get mistaken

13:31.894 --> 13:34.897
because of your skin color.

13:34.939 --> 13:36.815
Didn't you just say

13:34.939 --> 13:36.815
that wasn't the reason?

13:38.901 --> 13:40.861
Oh, my God.

13:38.901 --> 13:40.861
I'm a racist.

13:40.903 --> 13:42.071
Yeah, maybe a little bit.

13:42.113 --> 13:44.073
I can't believe I made

13:42.113 --> 13:44.073
a white-guy mistake.

13:44.115 --> 13:48.286
Asian girl, white guy,

13:44.115 --> 13:48.286
not so different anymore.

13:44.115 --> 13:48.286
Your privilege is on the rise.

13:49.162 --> 13:51.289
And,

13:51.331 --> 13:53.832
how bad is it to say

13:51.331 --> 13:53.832
you want to check out

13:51.331 --> 13:53.832
a woman's box?

13:55.918 --> 13:57.629
I should go back

13:55.918 --> 13:57.629
and apologize.

13:57.671 --> 13:59.589
And then sign up

13:57.671 --> 13:59.589
for some sensitivity training.

13:59.631 --> 14:02.467
Yeah. "MeToo", Janet.

14:02.509 --> 14:04.469
Why, what'd you do?

14:04.511 --> 14:05.553
[man] Sir.

14:06.929 --> 14:08.473
Thank you for your service.

14:11.934 --> 14:13.436
You welcome.

14:17.148 --> 14:18.692
Why he say like that?

14:22.987 --> 14:27.283
Because it say

14:22.987 --> 14:27.283
you is "Korean War Hero."

14:27.325 --> 14:28.535
What you tell Gerald?

14:28.576 --> 14:31.912
Nothing.

14:28.576 --> 14:31.912
I just tell him pig story.

14:31.954 --> 14:35.500
All these people think

14:31.954 --> 14:35.500
you is Korean war hero.

14:36.125 --> 14:38.294
And 90 years old.

14:38.336 --> 14:40.213
Hey, you guys made it.

14:40.254 --> 14:42.256
Gerald, why you write all this?

14:42.298 --> 14:44.676
I don't know,

14:42.298 --> 14:44.676
just telling your story.

14:44.718 --> 14:46.344
How old you think he is?

14:46.386 --> 14:51.641
Oh, Mrs. Kim, don't worry,

14:46.386 --> 14:51.641
the camera adds years.

14:46.386 --> 14:51.641
You look great.

14:51.683 --> 14:54.477
No, but this is just pig story.

14:54.519 --> 14:55.936
So modest.

14:55.978 --> 14:58.481
And, hey, check this out.

14:58.523 --> 15:00.274
[Appa] Second place?

15:00.316 --> 15:03.695
Oh, congratulation! For you.

15:03.737 --> 15:05.655
Hey, thanks.

15:05.697 --> 15:07.615
My mom used to

15:05.697 --> 15:07.615
drink these all the time.

15:17.625 --> 15:19.377
-Hi.

15:19.419 --> 15:21.337
I'm looking for

15:19.419 --> 15:21.337
one of your servers, Alicia.

15:21.379 --> 15:23.297
There are actually

15:21.379 --> 15:23.297
two servers named Alicia.

15:23.339 --> 15:30.304
Well, um,

15:23.339 --> 15:30.304
she's about this high,

15:23.339 --> 15:30.304
has cool braids in her hair.

15:30.346 --> 15:32.682
-Dark skin?

15:30.346 --> 15:32.682
-You said it, not me.

15:32.724 --> 15:34.975
I don't know

15:32.724 --> 15:34.975
if she's come in yet.

15:35.017 --> 15:36.477
Janet?

15:36.519 --> 15:38.521
Oh, hey! Chelsea.

15:38.563 --> 15:40.857
-This is Janet,

15:38.563 --> 15:40.857
my other roommate.

15:38.563 --> 15:40.857
-Hi.

15:40.899 --> 15:43.984
This is my friend, Sarah.

15:40.899 --> 15:43.984
What brings you here?

15:44.026 --> 15:45.779
Just had such a good time

15:44.026 --> 15:45.779
the other night,

15:45.820 --> 15:47.614
wanted to thank our server.

15:47.655 --> 15:49.616
Wow. We've never done that.

15:49.657 --> 15:51.492
You're gonna make us look bad.

15:51.534 --> 15:55.789
Hi. Chelsea Chettiar.

15:51.534 --> 15:55.789
Well, we're just

15:51.534 --> 15:55.789
going to grab lunch.

15:55.830 --> 15:57.457
-Great to see you.

15:55.830 --> 15:57.457
-Mmm-hmm.

15:57.498 --> 16:01.377
I'm sorry, Ms. Chettiar,

15:57.498 --> 16:01.377
but there's a flag

15:57.498 --> 16:01.377
on your file here...

16:01.419 --> 16:04.046
It seems that your membership

16:01.419 --> 16:04.046
has been recently suspended.

16:05.965 --> 16:07.007
[Chelsea] Um...

16:07.049 --> 16:08.635
[doorbell jingles]

16:08.676 --> 16:09.719
Hi.

16:17.435 --> 16:18.478
Hi, Mr. Kim.

16:19.103 --> 16:20.980
Recognize these guys?

16:22.440 --> 16:24.024
No.

16:24.066 --> 16:26.152
Fellow Korean War vets.

16:24.066 --> 16:26.152
The donation sparked

16:24.066 --> 16:26.152
some interest.

16:26.193 --> 16:27.445
What donation?

16:27.487 --> 16:29.238
The prize money.

16:27.487 --> 16:29.238
From the exhibit.

16:29.280 --> 16:32.867
I thought it only fitting

16:29.280 --> 16:32.867
to donate to the association

16:29.280 --> 16:32.867
on your behalf.

16:32.909 --> 16:35.035
Yeah, thanks.

16:35.077 --> 16:37.997
Thought I'd get a picture of

16:35.077 --> 16:37.997
all the brothers in arms.

16:38.873 --> 16:40.040
[unzips bag]

16:40.082 --> 16:41.000
Yeah.

16:42.710 --> 16:44.044
[Chelsea] When was this?

16:44.086 --> 16:47.047
Just a few days ago.

16:44.086 --> 16:47.047
I'm looking into it right now.

16:47.089 --> 16:48.591
[Chelsea sighs]

16:48.633 --> 16:50.635
I can explain.

16:50.677 --> 16:52.219
When I was here the other night,

16:52.261 --> 16:54.806
I made a stupid joke

16:52.261 --> 16:54.806
about checking out

16:52.261 --> 16:54.806
the server's box of teas.

16:54.848 --> 16:57.016
But I just said "box",

16:54.848 --> 16:57.016
as in her...

16:58.518 --> 17:00.186
And, I don't know

16:58.518 --> 17:00.186
why I said that.

17:00.227 --> 17:03.063
Or why the word "box" means,

17:00.227 --> 17:03.063
you know...

17:04.064 --> 17:06.233
Why is it even a term for that?

17:06.275 --> 17:09.445
And, anyway, the server

17:06.275 --> 17:09.445
was offended, obviously,

17:09.487 --> 17:11.739
and when I came back

17:09.487 --> 17:11.739
to apologize,

17:11.781 --> 17:15.075
I mistook her

17:11.781 --> 17:15.075
for another, um, server,

17:15.117 --> 17:18.287
making an unintentional

17:15.117 --> 17:18.287
other kind of mistake,

17:18.329 --> 17:22.542
which is also unacceptable

17:18.329 --> 17:22.542
and that's why your membership's

17:18.329 --> 17:22.542
been suspended.

17:22.583 --> 17:23.668
I'm sorry.

17:24.210 --> 17:26.671
Um. Okay.

17:26.713 --> 17:27.839
And here's Alicia.

17:28.297 --> 17:29.340
[Alicia] Hi.

17:30.967 --> 17:34.094
Hi. This is for you.

17:34.136 --> 17:38.098
It's a tip for Thursday night.

17:34.136 --> 17:38.098
Birthday party with my friends.

17:38.140 --> 17:40.476
-Tea box.

17:38.140 --> 17:40.476
-Yeah, I felt sick.

17:40.518 --> 17:43.312
Me, too. I felt sick

17:40.518 --> 17:43.312
thinking about what I said.

17:43.354 --> 17:46.649
No, I had

17:43.354 --> 17:46.649
some kind of flu bug.

17:43.354 --> 17:46.649
But what did you say?

17:46.691 --> 17:49.109
She wanted to

17:46.691 --> 17:49.109
check out your box.

17:49.151 --> 17:55.241
[laughs] Oh,

17:49.151 --> 17:55.241
because of the tea?

17:49.151 --> 17:55.241
That's hilarious. Wow!

17:55.282 --> 17:57.451
This is very generous.

17:55.282 --> 17:57.451
Thank you.

17:57.493 --> 17:59.078
Well, sure.

17:59.662 --> 18:01.414
[host] Thanks.

18:01.455 --> 18:04.124
It seems your family's payment

18:01.455 --> 18:04.124
went to the wrong account,

18:04.166 --> 18:05.919
so the suspension

18:04.166 --> 18:05.919
has now been lifted.

18:05.960 --> 18:07.587
We're so sorry about the mix-up.

18:07.628 --> 18:10.089
No problem.

18:07.628 --> 18:10.089
That's great to hear.

18:10.130 --> 18:12.091
Janet, you sure

18:10.130 --> 18:12.091
you don't wanna join?

18:14.176 --> 18:15.135
[camera clicking]

18:15.177 --> 18:16.470
Okay, now, everyone,

18:15.177 --> 18:16.470
hold up your spoons.

18:18.180 --> 18:19.306
-[Appa clears throat]

18:18.180 --> 18:19.306
-[camera clicking]

18:19.348 --> 18:21.684
Yours is a lot shinier

18:19.348 --> 18:21.684
than mine.

18:21.726 --> 18:23.978
You look very well-preserved.

18:24.020 --> 18:25.605
Thank you.

18:25.646 --> 18:29.108
I still got some

18:25.646 --> 18:29.108
shrapnel in my thigh

18:25.646 --> 18:29.108
from a firefight at Kapyong.

18:29.149 --> 18:31.151
Mr. Kim, tell them

18:29.149 --> 18:31.151
your pig story.

18:31.193 --> 18:32.361
I don't think so.

18:32.403 --> 18:33.738
[veteran 1] Too painful?

18:33.780 --> 18:38.325
We all carry those stories

18:33.780 --> 18:38.325
that still haunt us,

18:38.367 --> 18:39.994
keep us awake at night.

18:40.036 --> 18:41.955
Okay. Uh...

18:41.996 --> 18:45.291
Maybe little

18:41.996 --> 18:45.291
misunderstanding, huh?

18:45.332 --> 18:49.169
I was in Korean army.

18:45.332 --> 18:49.169
Not in Korean war.

18:49.211 --> 18:50.546
You're a deserter.

18:50.588 --> 18:55.175
No. I was born

18:50.588 --> 18:55.175
after Korean war is finish.

18:55.217 --> 18:59.680
I have spoon, but Gerald,

18:55.217 --> 18:59.680
he just such a confused boy

18:59.722 --> 19:04.184
and make such a silly mistake

18:59.722 --> 19:04.184
thinking I'm in war.

19:04.226 --> 19:05.311
[stammers] But I thought--

19:05.352 --> 19:06.938
You think wrong.

19:06.980 --> 19:08.272
So you're not a real veteran?

19:09.690 --> 19:10.775
No.

19:10.817 --> 19:12.401
But the cheque is real, right?

19:12.443 --> 19:14.821
I mean, that one isn't,

19:12.443 --> 19:14.821
but the regular-sized one

19:12.443 --> 19:14.821
is good to go.

19:14.862 --> 19:16.823
All right, let's take

19:14.862 --> 19:16.823
this picture.

19:17.364 --> 19:19.158
-Not you.

19:17.364 --> 19:19.158
-Okay.

19:25.247 --> 19:29.043
Ah, look at you,

19:25.247 --> 19:29.043
walking around.

19:29.085 --> 19:31.671
Well, I had really good care.

19:31.712 --> 19:34.214
Just want to

19:31.712 --> 19:34.214
bring you something.

19:34.256 --> 19:36.175
Oh. Thanks,<i> Ajuma.</i>

19:36.216 --> 19:37.760

19:37.802 --> 19:38.845

19:40.262 --> 19:42.974
Oh,<i> Ajuma,</i> this is

19:40.262 --> 19:42.974
my dad's auntie.

19:43.016 --> 19:46.144
Gomo, this is Mrs. Kim

19:43.016 --> 19:46.144
who I was telling you about.

19:46.185 --> 19:49.188
[both speaking Korean]

19:51.273 --> 19:53.985
Okay. Bye, Gomo. Okay.

19:54.027 --> 19:55.528
[Umma speaking Korean]

19:57.321 --> 19:59.239
So, she is helping you now?

19:59.281 --> 20:03.077
Yeah, well, what you said

19:59.281 --> 20:03.077
the other day about family

19:59.281 --> 20:03.077
really got to me.

20:03.119 --> 20:05.663
I realized I hadn't seen

20:03.119 --> 20:05.663
anyone on my dad's side

20:03.119 --> 20:05.663
since I was a kid.

20:05.705 --> 20:09.959
So, as far as this whole

20:05.705 --> 20:09.959
emergency contact thing goes,

20:05.705 --> 20:09.959
you're off the hook.

20:10.001 --> 20:13.420
Yeah, okay.

20:10.001 --> 20:13.420
But, still, can you trust her?

20:13.462 --> 20:16.632
Like you say,

20:13.462 --> 20:16.632
you don't see her

20:13.462 --> 20:16.632
since you was a kid.

20:16.674 --> 20:18.676
Yeah, well, that was

20:16.674 --> 20:18.676
like more on me.

20:18.718 --> 20:22.429
And so slow to get

20:18.718 --> 20:22.429
to hospital on bicycle.

20:22.471 --> 20:26.059
Yeah. Maybe I need

20:22.471 --> 20:26.059
two emergency contacts.

20:26.100 --> 20:29.228
Good idea.

20:26.100 --> 20:29.228
And put me down first.

20:29.269 --> 20:31.981
Sure. You want some?

20:32.023 --> 20:33.691
-She make?

20:32.023 --> 20:33.691
-Yeah!

20:33.733 --> 20:35.068
No.

20:37.319 --> 20:38.696
So?

20:38.738 --> 20:40.364
Yeah, it was pretty cool.

20:40.406 --> 20:41.949
And that moment you jump out,

20:40.406 --> 20:41.949
you think you're

20:40.406 --> 20:41.949
not gonna do it,

20:41.991 --> 20:43.117
but then you just go for it.

20:43.159 --> 20:45.036
Oh, my God,

20:43.159 --> 20:45.036
that moment, so crazy.

20:45.078 --> 20:49.289
Well, I got hit

20:45.078 --> 20:49.289
in the head with a disk.

20:45.078 --> 20:49.289
That was also crazy.

20:49.331 --> 20:51.125
And did you go solo or tandem?

20:51.167 --> 20:52.292
Solo.

20:52.334 --> 20:54.170
And European

20:52.334 --> 20:54.170
or smoke-jumper style?

20:54.212 --> 20:55.588
Uh...

20:55.629 --> 20:58.174
Either way. It's life-changing.

20:55.629 --> 20:58.174
But you already know that.

20:58.216 --> 21:01.010
-I'm gonna go

20:58.216 --> 21:01.010
jump on some calls.

20:58.216 --> 21:01.010
-[Jung chuckles]

21:01.052 --> 21:02.678
Without a parachute.

21:02.720 --> 21:03.971
[both chuckle]

21:04.013 --> 21:05.514
[sighs] I never did it.

21:07.225 --> 21:08.976
I mean, I went

21:07.225 --> 21:08.976
but I never jumped.

21:09.018 --> 21:10.853
It was a lot higher

21:09.018 --> 21:10.853
than I thought.

21:10.895 --> 21:12.980
So, I just flew back down

21:10.895 --> 21:12.980
with the pilot.

21:13.022 --> 21:14.356
So what did the pilot say?

21:14.398 --> 21:16.650
Nothing. Super-quiet ride.

21:16.692 --> 21:18.318
He must have been disappointed.

21:18.360 --> 21:19.486
She.

21:19.528 --> 21:20.571
Ouch.

21:21.363 --> 21:23.282
