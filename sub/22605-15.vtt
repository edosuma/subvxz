WEBVTT

00:09.491 --> 00:11.759
(phone chimes, vibrates)

00:16.030 --> 00:18.000
(sighs)

00:18.001 --> 00:21.335
Give me a minute with her.

00:25.074 --> 00:26.874
Thanks, Frank.

00:29.745 --> 00:32.680
Hey.

00:32.682 --> 00:35.751
Should I even ask how your night was?

00:35.752 --> 00:39.555
Well, after hours of being polygraphed

00:39.556 --> 00:41.557
and detained somewhere
in the bowels of Langley...

00:41.558 --> 00:42.758
Did you know Langley had bowels?

00:42.759 --> 00:45.561
- Well, I suspected.
- Accused of treason,

00:45.562 --> 00:47.563
then cleared of suspicion and sent home,

00:47.564 --> 00:50.232
where I found my apartment
turned completely upside-down

00:50.233 --> 00:52.701
and my mattress slit
open with a razor blade.

00:52.702 --> 00:54.536
I had a very...

00:54.537 --> 00:58.273
restless and paranoid night
at the Potomac Lodge.

00:58.274 --> 01:00.442
I am really sorry. I-I...

01:00.443 --> 01:01.977
I want to ask how you could've

01:01.978 --> 01:04.513
suspected me of being the mole.

01:04.513 --> 01:07.549
But, again, how could either
of us have suspected Juliet?

01:07.550 --> 01:09.318
Right? I-I know. I...

01:09.319 --> 01:11.286
You said on the phone
that she left a note.

01:11.287 --> 01:12.688
Yeah.

01:12.689 --> 01:15.489
Not that it's a lot of help.

01:19.228 --> 01:20.762
You okay?

01:20.763 --> 01:22.097
Yeah, I guess.

01:22.098 --> 01:24.099
You know, for what it's worth,

01:24.100 --> 01:25.868
I never suspected you.

01:25.869 --> 01:27.769
- Oh.
- Oh, my God.

01:27.770 --> 01:29.338
Can I get you a drink?

01:29.339 --> 01:31.273
You know, I could use one,

01:31.274 --> 01:33.475
but it can wait. I want to see the note.

01:33.476 --> 01:34.943
Is that it?

01:34.944 --> 01:37.146
Don't get too excited.
It's pretty underwritten.

01:37.147 --> 01:39.148
Does Langley know where she is?

01:39.149 --> 01:42.985
They've created a task force
to look for her, but...

01:42.986 --> 01:46.622
well, knowing Juliet,
I don't like their chances.

01:46.623 --> 01:50.425
"Whatever happens, know this:
I did it for my country.

01:50.426 --> 01:52.494
This is a righteous cause."

01:52.495 --> 01:54.129
Guess we can

01:54.130 --> 01:57.566
rule out coercion or
financial motivation.

01:57.567 --> 02:00.769
It's like it's some kind of
misguided patriotism.

02:00.770 --> 02:02.938
So righteous that she thought
it was worth murdering

02:02.939 --> 02:05.607
one of our closest friends,
not to mention the previous

02:05.608 --> 02:07.609
♪Secretary of State?
It's a pretty high body count

02:07.610 --> 02:08.776
when you put it all together.

02:08.777 --> 02:11.045
Marsh, George, the victims in Turkey.

02:11.047 --> 02:13.148
I just can't believe
Juliet was working alone.

02:13.149 --> 02:14.950
It seems like a prelude
to something bigger.

02:14.951 --> 02:16.218
Right?

02:16.219 --> 02:19.555
Her choice of verb tense
implies that it isn't over.

02:19.556 --> 02:21.323
So what's going on in Turkey?

02:21.324 --> 02:23.158
I mean, do you think
their government knows

02:23.159 --> 02:25.794
what really happened
with the raid in Istanbul?

02:25.795 --> 02:29.031
They won't release the body of
the black ops guy; that can't be

02:29.032 --> 02:30.365
a good sign.

02:30.366 --> 02:32.634
- That's everything we have so far.
- Yeah.

02:32.635 --> 02:34.469
Well, I might as well get started.

02:34.470 --> 02:36.805
I don't want to miss that
complimentary breakfast.

02:36.806 --> 02:40.475
How long do you think you're gonna

02:40.476 --> 02:42.010
stay mad at me?

02:42.011 --> 02:44.746
Well, you were just doing your job.

02:44.747 --> 02:46.548
- See you.
- Bye.

02:46.549 --> 02:48.250
So, like, less than a year?

02:48.251 --> 02:49.618
Probably.

02:49.619 --> 02:51.153
MAN: <i>Any movement</i>

02:51.154 --> 02:53.121
- on the E.U. trade talks?
- DAISY: Some.

02:53.122 --> 02:54.523
They've agreed to lift tariffs

02:54.524 --> 02:55.691
on citrus and pork,

02:55.692 --> 02:57.559
but apparently there's
still some blockage

02:57.560 --> 02:59.094
over the issue of cheese.

02:59.095 --> 03:00.395
(laughter)

03:00.396 --> 03:01.730
Speaking of Europe and dairy,

03:01.731 --> 03:03.632
tonight the secretary will be attending

03:03.633 --> 03:06.235
a gala dinner hosted by the
Italian foreign minister,

03:06.236 --> 03:09.404
where Chef Nanni will be serving
his famous scacciata pies.

03:09.405 --> 03:11.106
You'll find a complete
menu and guest list

03:11.107 --> 03:13.508
in the packet being
handed out by Phoebe.

03:13.509 --> 03:15.210
What will you be wearing?

03:15.211 --> 03:16.278
Something loose.

03:16.279 --> 03:17.412
- (chuckles)
- Greg?

03:17.413 --> 03:19.481
Uh, my sources tell me that the Turks

03:19.482 --> 03:21.016
have moved the body of Brett Boris

03:21.017 --> 03:23.151
to their National Police
Headquarters in Ankara

03:23.152 --> 03:24.987
instead of releasing the
remains to his family.

03:24.988 --> 03:26.288
Why is that?

03:26.289 --> 03:29.391
Well, Mr. Boris, an American
tourist visiting Istanbul,

03:29.392 --> 03:31.426
was the victim of a brutal homicide.

03:31.427 --> 03:32.995
The Turkish government still
needs the body for forensics.

03:32.996 --> 03:35.163
Mr. Boris was a decorated veteran

03:35.164 --> 03:36.598
of U.S. Special Forces.

03:36.599 --> 03:39.234
You really maintain that he
was in Turkey as a tourist?

03:39.235 --> 03:42.237
Yes, and the United States
is doing everything it can

03:42.238 --> 03:43.705
to support the investigation.

03:43.706 --> 03:45.374
Well, that just seems like
a big coincidence.

03:45.375 --> 03:46.475
If I wasted my time

03:46.476 --> 03:48.310
on every whisper of
government conspiracy,

03:48.311 --> 03:50.979
we wouldn't get to talk about
important things like cheese.

03:50.980 --> 03:53.081
- (laughter)
- Next?

03:53.082 --> 03:56.285
ANCHOR: The State Department denies
any direct American involvement.

03:56.286 --> 03:59.888
POLICY EXPERT: Yes, but you have
to go all the way back to 1974

03:59.889 --> 04:01.923
to find a time when
things were this bad.

04:01.924 --> 04:04.159
Do you have any microloans in Turkey?

04:04.160 --> 04:05.961
No, thank God.

04:05.962 --> 04:08.196
Hey, gadget head.

04:08.197 --> 04:10.132
- Oh.
- Actual human present.

04:10.133 --> 04:12.434
Morning. Sorry I forgot
to light up with joy.

04:12.435 --> 04:14.603
It's that Preston kid again.

04:14.604 --> 04:15.771
Preston.

04:15.772 --> 04:17.439
Oh, is that that dweeb in your class

04:17.440 --> 04:19.308
who posts all the crap
about Mom on his page?

04:19.309 --> 04:21.310
Yeah, yeah, it's just trash talk.

04:21.310 --> 04:22.678
I shouldn't be bothered by it.

04:22.679 --> 04:26.048
His dad runs some sort of
international corporation.

04:26.049 --> 04:29.217
So everything Mom does is
somehow ruining his trust fund.

04:29.218 --> 04:31.253
(laughter) Oh, you should unfriend him.

04:31.254 --> 04:32.721
- No.
- Really?

04:32.722 --> 04:34.523
- Yeah, cut him off.
- No.

04:34.524 --> 04:35.757
You don't need that.

04:35.758 --> 04:37.326
Okay, but he'll find out.

04:37.327 --> 04:38.694
Exactly.

04:38.695 --> 04:40.662
So? I mean, at least
you won't have to listen

04:40.663 --> 04:42.297
to his brilliant opining anymore.

04:42.298 --> 04:44.700
But he goes to our school.

04:44.701 --> 04:45.767
What's your point?

04:45.768 --> 04:47.002
So, it'll be awkward.

04:47.003 --> 04:49.504
He's 13 years old;
his whole life is awkward.

04:49.505 --> 04:51.139
- Whatever.
- You might as well own it, dude.

04:51.140 --> 04:52.341
Okay, all right, fine.

04:52.342 --> 04:54.776
You know what, awkward's
going with bossy.

04:54.777 --> 04:56.478
- This is the worst idea ever.
- No, no, no, no, no.

04:56.479 --> 04:58.480
- There, there, it's done, it's done.
- Okay, whatever, your mistake.

04:58.481 --> 04:59.748
- Okay?
- What's done?

04:59.749 --> 05:00.949
Jason just unfriended someone.

05:00.950 --> 05:02.317
- (sighs)
- Big mistake.

05:02.318 --> 05:03.852
Is that like blocking someone?

05:03.853 --> 05:05.087
No, blocking is different.

05:05.088 --> 05:06.621
Unfriending is a statement.

05:06.622 --> 05:08.223
- Unfriending is worse.
- I don't get it.

05:08.224 --> 05:09.424
If you want to confront someone,

05:09.425 --> 05:10.926
why don't you just do it in person?

05:10.927 --> 05:12.661
(laughter) W-What?

05:12.662 --> 05:14.229
Come on, "unfriend" isn't even a word.

05:14.230 --> 05:16.164
- Why would you... - Do you really
want to be in the middle of this?

05:16.165 --> 05:17.399
No, I really don't. Let's go.

05:17.400 --> 05:19.000
Let's go, come on.

05:19.001 --> 05:20.535
Bag, bag, bag, bag, bag.

05:20.536 --> 05:22.837
- I got it.
- Books, books, let's go.

05:24.506 --> 05:25.941
- (groans)
- Are you okay?

05:25.942 --> 05:27.876
I mean, first microloans, now this.

05:27.877 --> 05:29.945
Yeah, I'm good.

05:29.946 --> 05:31.613
It's the job.

05:31.614 --> 05:33.347
Bye.

05:37.519 --> 05:39.521
(shouting)

05:39.522 --> 05:41.822
(gunfire over video)

05:42.924 --> 05:45.494
Well, something tells me

05:45.495 --> 05:46.962
that's not a cat video.

05:46.963 --> 05:48.430
This just came in from
Turkish intelligence.

05:48.431 --> 05:50.065
Closed-circuit camera
from one of the shops

05:50.066 --> 05:51.166
across the street.

05:51.167 --> 05:52.267
It's not high quality,

05:52.268 --> 05:53.969
but it's clear enough.

05:53.970 --> 05:57.139
Well, I guess this is why
they're holding on to the body.

05:57.140 --> 06:00.075
And why they're demanding an explanation.

06:00.076 --> 06:01.676
How about the search for Juliet?

06:01.677 --> 06:04.079
My task force assembled
less than 12 hours ago.

06:04.080 --> 06:06.347
These things take time.

06:08.817 --> 06:11.118
Anybody got any ideas?

06:14.156 --> 06:16.291
I think we need to come
clean with Turkey.

06:16.292 --> 06:17.359
Admit our involvement?

06:17.360 --> 06:18.427
On a limited basis.

06:18.428 --> 06:21.062
We admit to running an
op on Turkish soil,

06:21.063 --> 06:22.364
but we withhold the details.

06:22.365 --> 06:24.433
Yeah, like the fact that
we were trying to find

06:24.434 --> 06:25.700
the person who killed Secretary Marsh?

06:25.701 --> 06:27.135
Specifically, yes.

06:27.136 --> 06:28.236
I disagree.

06:28.237 --> 06:30.238
The Turks have been
unreliable partners lately.

06:30.239 --> 06:32.641
Even a partial truth
could be a liability.

06:32.642 --> 06:33.842
I say we double down.

06:33.843 --> 06:35.544
Deny any connection to Brett Boris.

06:35.545 --> 06:36.845
What about the video?

06:36.846 --> 06:38.747
All I see is a couple
of private citizens

06:38.748 --> 06:40.916
engaged in a private activity,

06:40.917 --> 06:42.851
a botched robbery or a kidnapping.

06:42.852 --> 06:44.786
And some other private citizens

06:44.787 --> 06:48.290
with assault rifles lying
in wait on a rooftop?

06:48.291 --> 06:50.025
They will never buy it.

06:50.026 --> 06:51.393
They don't have to;
they just have to hesitate

06:51.394 --> 06:52.894
long enough for the whole
thing to blow over.

06:52.895 --> 06:54.663
How long will that be?

06:54.664 --> 06:56.331
Maybe as soon as another news cycle.

06:56.332 --> 06:58.166
ELIZABETH: What about the body?

06:58.167 --> 06:59.601
We just leave it over there?

06:59.602 --> 07:01.002
Brett Boris knew the risks.

07:01.003 --> 07:02.137
They all do.

07:02.138 --> 07:03.738
Brett knew what he was signing up for,

07:03.739 --> 07:06.007
but his friends and family didn't.

07:06.008 --> 07:08.877
And they're gonna start
asking questions,

07:08.878 --> 07:10.278
and they might go to the press.

07:10.279 --> 07:11.513
- Then what?
- Stall them.

07:11.514 --> 07:13.548
With what?

07:13.549 --> 07:15.283
And we can't hold them off forever.

07:15.284 --> 07:17.451
You'll think of something.

07:18.620 --> 07:20.388
I'll talk to POTUS.

07:20.389 --> 07:22.657
But until then, we'll
stick with our story.

07:22.658 --> 07:26.760
We disavow all connection
to the operation in Turkey.

07:30.065 --> 07:31.399
Abraham Lincoln's
favorite physical sport?

07:31.400 --> 07:32.968
Morning.

07:32.969 --> 07:34.002
Wrestling.

07:34.003 --> 07:35.136
Morning, Madam Secretary.

07:35.137 --> 07:36.538
All right, what's new?

07:36.539 --> 07:38.573
Uh, well, my trivia team,

07:38.574 --> 07:40.976
the Bill of Right Answers, won last night.

07:40.977 --> 07:43.044
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

07:43.045 --> 07:44.579
But when I ask what's new,

07:44.580 --> 07:46.214
I usually mean affairs of state.

07:46.215 --> 07:48.083
DAISY: Greg Taylor was asking

07:48.084 --> 07:49.784
about Brett Boris during
this morning's brief.

07:49.785 --> 07:52.020
I mean, he was a dog with a bone.

07:52.021 --> 07:53.855
Clearly he's cooking up some
elaborate conspiracy theory.

07:53.856 --> 07:55.156
Of course he is.

07:55.157 --> 07:56.825
NADINE: Do we have any new information

07:56.826 --> 07:58.159
about Mr. Boris' status?

07:58.160 --> 08:00.395
- No, I'm afraid not.
- I only ask

08:00.396 --> 08:02.597
because his mother is
downstairs in Consular Affairs.

08:02.598 --> 08:04.733
You're just telling me this now?

08:04.734 --> 08:06.801
Um, when a tourist dies abroad,

08:06.802 --> 08:08.603
very often the bodies are held up

08:08.604 --> 08:10.305
and the families come calling.

08:10.306 --> 08:11.606
If we have an update,

08:11.607 --> 08:13.441
- I could pass it along.
- Bring her up to my office.

08:13.442 --> 08:14.809
That's highly irregular, ma'am.

08:14.810 --> 08:16.978
And it could add fuel to
the conspiracy theorists.

08:16.979 --> 08:18.580
He was an Army Ranger.

08:18.581 --> 08:21.750
Our military families
deserve special attention.

08:21.751 --> 08:24.386
Yes, but he wasn't there
in that capacity.

08:24.387 --> 08:26.521
Please, I'm happy to go
and talk to her myself.

08:26.522 --> 08:28.123
Send her up, thanks.

08:28.124 --> 08:29.724
WOMAN: <i>Why on earth</i>

08:29.725 --> 08:31.927
would Turkey hold up
returning Brett's body?

08:31.928 --> 08:34.361
We're doing everything we
can to move things along,

08:34.363 --> 08:36.865
which I know is of little solace to you.

08:36.866 --> 08:40.302
It's all just so strange.

08:40.303 --> 08:43.605
I didn't even have any idea
that my son was in Turkey.

08:43.606 --> 08:45.006
We talk all the time.

08:45.007 --> 08:47.709
He'd have told me if he was
going on a trip like that.

08:47.710 --> 08:50.611
Maybe it was a last-minute decision.

08:51.680 --> 08:55.617
Brett served two tours in
Iraq and one in Afghanistan.

08:55.618 --> 08:56.851
Retired last year.

08:56.852 --> 08:57.986
If he was thinking

08:57.987 --> 08:59.454
about going on vacation, believe me,

08:59.455 --> 09:01.289
it wasn't to that part of the world.

09:01.290 --> 09:05.427
I promise we'll try and
find out what happened.

09:05.428 --> 09:07.929
Mrs. Boris...

09:07.930 --> 09:09.564
Um, I'm sorry.

09:09.565 --> 09:13.368
Has anybody from the press
tried to contact you?

09:13.369 --> 09:14.536
Yeah, a reporter called.

09:14.537 --> 09:16.771
Uh, Greg Taylor from the <i>Chronicle.</i>

09:16.772 --> 09:18.573
He was asking about an interview.

09:18.574 --> 09:20.508
Can you refer him back to us?

09:20.509 --> 09:23.745
It's just that any press right
now might anger the Turks,

09:23.746 --> 09:25.580
and that will slow down the process.

09:25.581 --> 09:26.748
Okay, I will.

09:26.749 --> 09:28.215
Thank you.

09:30.352 --> 09:32.520
That's Brett.

09:32.521 --> 09:34.489
He's very handsome.

09:34.490 --> 09:36.958
We're a military family, Madam Secretary.

09:36.959 --> 09:39.761
My father is buried at Arlington.

09:39.762 --> 09:42.097
He died in Korea when
I was a little girl,

09:42.098 --> 09:45.033
but even then I understood
his death had meaning.

09:45.034 --> 09:47.768
But this...

09:49.404 --> 09:52.539
It doesn't make any sense.

09:54.943 --> 09:56.710
You hold on to that.

09:58.113 --> 10:00.248
I want you to look at it every day

10:00.249 --> 10:02.282
until my son is back home.

10:02.984 --> 10:05.519
We'll be in touch very soon.

10:07.656 --> 10:09.124
Madam Secretary.

10:09.125 --> 10:11.425
Thank you, ma'am.

10:13.828 --> 10:15.830
You really need to see something.

10:15.831 --> 10:17.332
NEWSCASTER: We're looking at footage

10:17.333 --> 10:18.767
from an alleyway in Tarlabas..

10:18.768 --> 10:20.702
NADINE: The Turkish government released

10:20.703 --> 10:22.871
the footage about an hour ago.

10:22.872 --> 10:26.074
They're accusing the CIA
of attempted kidnapping.

10:26.075 --> 10:27.242
Have you seen this?

10:27.243 --> 10:28.810
Do you know what this is?

10:28.811 --> 10:31.346
Madam Secretary, the
president's office is calling.

10:31.347 --> 10:33.348
DAISY: Are we involved in this?

10:33.349 --> 10:36.251
Tell the president that I'm on my way.

10:36.252 --> 10:37.919
- What about the press?
- No comment.

10:37.920 --> 10:39.354
Are we clear? No comment.

10:39.355 --> 10:41.256
Yes, ma'am.

10:41.257 --> 10:42.557
<i>Several experts are already weighing in.</i>

10:42.558 --> 10:45.393
<i>We have one of them en route
to the studio right now...</i>

10:45.394 --> 10:52.871
Subtitle sync and corrections
by awaqeded for www.addic7ed.com.

10:59.171 --> 11:00.679
DALTON: <i>Yesterday you told me</i>

11:00.680 --> 11:02.373
the fallout from this op was contained.

11:02.374 --> 11:03.441
That we had deniability.

11:03.442 --> 11:04.942
Now our dirty laundry is airing

11:04.943 --> 11:06.911
on satellite news all over the world,

11:06.912 --> 11:09.680
and I'm being burned in effigy
in the streets of Istanbul.

11:09.681 --> 11:11.382
We knew they were upset,
we never anticipated it

11:11.383 --> 11:12.850
- going this far.
- I don't have time for excuses

11:12.851 --> 11:14.185
right now. We need to get this

11:14.186 --> 11:16.487
genie back in the bottle, and fast.

11:16.488 --> 11:18.254
I'm waiting.

11:19.623 --> 11:22.793
Mr. President, the only
way to kill this story

11:22.794 --> 11:24.462
is to get the Turks to recant.

11:24.463 --> 11:25.696
We force their hand.

11:25.697 --> 11:27.131
Expel the ambassador.

11:27.132 --> 11:30.501
Cancel the joint military
exercises in the Black Sea.

11:30.502 --> 11:32.770
We already tried that,
we already tried hardball,

11:32.771 --> 11:34.205
and this is where it got us.

11:34.206 --> 11:35.740
Then give me an alternative.

11:35.741 --> 11:39.143
I clear my schedule and fly
to Ankara straightaway.

11:39.144 --> 11:40.244
And do what?

11:40.245 --> 11:42.513
Apologize for the deaths
of their two citizens.

11:42.514 --> 11:44.415
Why? We weren't the ones
who started shooting.

11:44.416 --> 11:47.017
We're the ones who violated
their sovereignty.

11:47.018 --> 11:48.385
And if we had kept

11:48.386 --> 11:52.022
mission integrity, those
people would still be alive.

11:52.023 --> 11:53.624
And then there's the
matter of Mrs. Boris.

11:53.625 --> 11:55.059
The sooner we bring

11:55.060 --> 11:59.864
her son's body home from Turkey,
the sooner this story goes away.

11:59.865 --> 12:02.833
But if we don't make
nice with the Turks,

12:02.834 --> 12:05.134
I... I can't make that happen.

12:07.872 --> 12:09.907
Then go.

12:09.908 --> 12:11.876
Thank you, sir.

12:11.877 --> 12:13.277
But do it quietly.

12:13.278 --> 12:15.262
Not even your staff can know
the real reason you're there.

12:15.263 --> 12:18.015
And if this soft touch doesn't work...

12:18.016 --> 12:21.651
I'm taking Russell's advice
and bringing out the hammer.

12:25.389 --> 12:26.957
So, Turkey at last, huh?

12:26.958 --> 12:29.393
Not how I imagined it.

12:29.394 --> 12:32.462
You mean on the verge
of diplomatic collapse?

12:33.664 --> 12:35.933
That and everything else.

12:35.934 --> 12:37.468
I can still go.

12:37.469 --> 12:39.870
Well, it's not that kind of a trip.

12:39.871 --> 12:41.872
I need to stay under the radar.

12:41.873 --> 12:45.342
You know, just want to swoop in,

12:45.343 --> 12:49.046
change the course of
history and swoop out.

12:49.047 --> 12:51.348
Hey, listen, I was talking to Alison

12:51.349 --> 12:53.584
about Jason's situation at school.

12:53.585 --> 12:55.085
I-I got to tell you,

12:55.086 --> 12:56.587
this Preston kid sounds like a problem.

12:56.588 --> 12:57.855
Oh, he <i>is</i> a problem.

12:57.856 --> 12:59.690
- Should...
- But Jason's got his number.

12:59.691 --> 13:02.560
Should we call the dean, maybe?
Or maybe talk to his parents.

13:02.561 --> 13:03.727
I don't think we're there yet.

13:03.728 --> 13:05.329
We should let him handle him on his own.

13:05.330 --> 13:07.464
- What if he's a bully?
- He <i>is</i> a bully.

13:07.465 --> 13:09.233
See, that's bad,

13:09.234 --> 13:12.002
because we have to stay
on top of bullying.

13:12.003 --> 13:13.504
It's-it's the new...

13:13.505 --> 13:14.638
Bullying?

13:14.639 --> 13:17.341
Yeah. It can get out of control.

13:17.342 --> 13:19.376
Well, if that happens,
then we'll deal with it.

13:19.377 --> 13:20.778
(groans softly)

13:20.779 --> 13:22.813
Hey... hey, come here.

13:22.814 --> 13:24.148
What... what's wrong?

13:24.149 --> 13:25.516
I, uh...

13:25.517 --> 13:26.550
What's wrong?

13:26.551 --> 13:28.184
(sighs)

13:29.253 --> 13:31.555
I had to lie to that poor woman,

13:31.556 --> 13:34.458
right to her face,
when I knew full well

13:34.459 --> 13:36.227
that the reason her son was killed

13:36.228 --> 13:38.996
is because of an op
that I signed off on.

13:38.997 --> 13:41.732
And I know... I get it...
it's part of the job.

13:41.733 --> 13:43.167
But it's a part of the job, Henry,

13:43.168 --> 13:44.768
that I am never going to get used to.

13:44.769 --> 13:47.471
That guy died because of
Juliet, not because of you.

13:47.472 --> 13:48.606
Because I trusted Juliet.

13:48.607 --> 13:51.442
You trusted one of your
best friends, yes.

13:51.443 --> 13:52.576
You were betrayed, babe.

13:52.577 --> 13:55.713
I think you can give
yourself a pass for that.

13:55.714 --> 13:59.049
Dante classified it as
the worst sin of all.

13:59.050 --> 14:02.085
He devoted an entire level of
hell to its practitioners.

14:04.021 --> 14:05.856
I just never could get a handle on

14:05.857 --> 14:08.257
the "trust no one" part of my job.

14:09.393 --> 14:10.794
Good.

14:10.795 --> 14:13.229
I wouldn't want you to.

14:15.766 --> 14:18.234
You taste like toothpaste.

14:21.305 --> 14:22.539
Is the Secretary in?

14:22.540 --> 14:23.574
Uh, she's in a meeting.

14:23.575 --> 14:25.042
Wh-When will she be free?

14:25.043 --> 14:27.411
I'm not sure. Don't you have a
press conference to attend to?

14:27.412 --> 14:28.479
I do.

14:28.480 --> 14:30.047
And what do you mean, you're not sure?

14:30.048 --> 14:31.448
You're the Schedule Elf.
You know everything.

14:31.449 --> 14:33.150
She cleared the week
for an undisclosed trip.

14:33.151 --> 14:34.752
And I don't appreciate the comparison

14:34.753 --> 14:36.687
to a magical woodland creature.

14:36.688 --> 14:37.955
Blake, I...

14:37.956 --> 14:39.023
Is there a problem?

14:39.024 --> 14:41.158
Yes. Can you walk with me?

14:41.159 --> 14:43.560
You have to give me something on Turkey.

14:43.561 --> 14:45.262
I already did...
they're called talking points.

14:45.263 --> 14:46.964
Well, the press isn't buying them.

14:46.965 --> 14:48.432
And, frankly, neither am I.

14:48.433 --> 14:50.734
- Where are you going with this?
- I know we're hiding something,

14:50.735 --> 14:52.403
but I don't know what,
and it's scaring me.

14:52.404 --> 14:55.039
That's called working
in the State Department.

14:55.040 --> 14:56.540
If you'd like to consider a transfer,

14:56.541 --> 14:57.975
I'm sure there's a lot less intrigue

14:57.976 --> 14:59.777
at the Bureau of Weights and Measures.

14:59.778 --> 15:01.679
I know there are things
that I can't know.

15:01.680 --> 15:03.580
And I don't mind
stonewalling the press.

15:03.581 --> 15:04.848
But this is different.

15:04.849 --> 15:07.518
This is purposely giving
them misinformation.

15:07.519 --> 15:09.520
"The U.S. government has no idea

15:09.521 --> 15:11.255
"why Brett Boris acted the
way he did in the video.

15:11.256 --> 15:12.389
"Brett Boris was not working for

15:12.390 --> 15:14.658
the U.S. government in any capacity".

15:14.659 --> 15:16.694
- This is lying.
- This is the job.

15:16.695 --> 15:18.228
I'm as much in the dark as you are.

15:18.229 --> 15:19.930
But for now, that's all
the information we have.

15:19.931 --> 15:21.865
Due respect, Nadine.

15:21.866 --> 15:23.534
You're not the one who
has to go in there.

15:23.535 --> 15:25.336
Look, she's holding out on us.

15:25.337 --> 15:26.769
That's a big deal.

couple of questions...

15:39.384 --> 15:40.384
REPORTERS: Daisy! Daisy! Daisy!

15:40.385 --> 15:41.385
Uh, Andy.

15:41.386 --> 15:42.586
Was Brett Boris in the CIA?

15:42.587 --> 15:43.721
No. Next question.

15:43.722 --> 15:45.155
What was he doing in Istanbul?

15:45.156 --> 15:46.590
He was there on a tourist visa.

15:46.591 --> 15:47.791
I can't speak to his
motives for traveling.

15:47.792 --> 15:50.461
Why was he kidnapping
an Iranian national?

15:50.462 --> 15:52.496
"The U.S. government has no
idea why Brett Boris acted

15:52.497 --> 15:54.031
the way he did in the video."

15:54.032 --> 15:55.699
- (reporters clamoring)
- MAN: Was Boris a mercenary?

15:55.700 --> 15:56.834
WOMAN: I just have one more question!

15:56.835 --> 15:57.968
(clamor continues)

15:57.969 --> 16:00.104
BLAKE: Hey! You lied to me.

16:00.105 --> 16:01.105
ELIZABETH: Mrs. Boris...

16:01.106 --> 16:02.172
I saw that video.

16:02.173 --> 16:03.307
My son was Special Forces.

16:03.308 --> 16:04.575
I understand what I'm looking at.

16:04.576 --> 16:06.010
Brett was working for the CIA,

16:06.011 --> 16:07.276
wasn't he?

16:09.580 --> 16:10.614
Yes.

16:10.615 --> 16:12.449
Why didn't you tell me?!

16:12.450 --> 16:15.452
Because your son made
a choice not to,

16:15.453 --> 16:17.121
and I had to respect that.

16:17.122 --> 16:18.489
He was trying to protect me.

16:18.490 --> 16:21.291
But now he's dead, and I want answers.

16:21.292 --> 16:23.494
I'm afraid I can't give
you any more right now.

16:23.495 --> 16:25.496
It was an undercover
operation, and it went wrong,

16:25.497 --> 16:28.866
and now your people are just
hanging him out to dry,

16:28.867 --> 16:30.501
like he was some kind of criminal.

16:30.502 --> 16:33.804
With respect, your son knew
what he was signing up for.

16:33.805 --> 16:36.407
His mission was top secret.

16:36.408 --> 16:38.075
We can't make it public.

16:38.076 --> 16:39.943
Yes, you can.

16:39.944 --> 16:42.111
And if you don't, I will.

16:43.013 --> 16:44.381
If you do that,

16:44.382 --> 16:47.051
if you go to the media,
I can't help you.

16:47.052 --> 16:48.352
I don't want your help!

16:48.353 --> 16:52.255
I promised to bring your son home.

16:53.524 --> 16:54.992
Please give me that chance.

16:54.993 --> 16:58.427
Why on earth would I trust you?

16:59.163 --> 17:00.531
Come with me.

17:00.532 --> 17:03.300
Come with me to Turkey.

17:03.301 --> 17:06.470
You stay at the embassy, we'll
help you bring Brett home.

17:06.471 --> 17:10.607
If I can't deliver, I
won't stand in your way.

17:10.608 --> 17:13.310
You have my word on that.

17:13.310 --> 17:15.445
(school bell ringing)

17:15.446 --> 17:17.848
PRESTON: Hey, whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!

17:17.848 --> 17:19.916
Hey J-Man, what's happening?

17:19.917 --> 17:21.652
Come on, dude, why are you ignoring me?

17:21.653 --> 17:23.587
Because you're ignorable, Preston.

17:23.588 --> 17:25.489
Oh, so you do acknowledge my existence.

17:25.490 --> 17:28.124
I wasn't sure about that
after you unfriended me.

17:30.461 --> 17:31.862
Hey, hey!

17:31.863 --> 17:34.264
Hey, McCord over here...

17:34.265 --> 17:35.866
McCord's a mama's boy.

17:35.867 --> 17:37.434
Doesn't like it when I repost things

17:37.435 --> 17:39.503
about the cover-up in Turkey.

17:39.504 --> 17:41.538
My mom had nothing to do with
what happened in Turkey.

17:41.539 --> 17:43.407
Okay, well, why don't you
go tell that to CNN.

17:43.408 --> 17:46.209
'Cause they're calling her out
for the liar that she is.

17:47.911 --> 17:50.213
(students clamoring)

17:59.456 --> 18:01.992
Hey, break it up! Break it up!

18:01.993 --> 18:03.260
Get off him, Jason!

18:03.261 --> 18:04.862
Now!

18:04.863 --> 18:06.964
Ow!

18:06.965 --> 18:09.232
Come on, Preston.

18:11.301 --> 18:12.735
(coughs)

18:16.507 --> 18:18.808
You, too, McCord.

18:21.778 --> 18:23.147
ELIZABETH: <i>He's suspended?</i>

18:23.148 --> 18:25.115
HENRY: Yep. Quaker school, babe.

18:25.116 --> 18:28.318
And Preston's nose...
it-it's <i>really</i> broken?

18:28.319 --> 18:30.954
Apparently, Jason has
a pretty good right jab.

18:30.955 --> 18:33.590
Wow, I can't even believe
we're talking about our kid.

18:33.591 --> 18:35.592
You're the one that
wanted to go for three.

18:35.593 --> 18:37.161
Oh, God, I'm so used to him

18:37.162 --> 18:41.031
getting in trouble for
<i>saying</i> the wrong thing.

18:41.032 --> 18:43.734
I guess he figured out
that actions speak louder.

18:43.735 --> 18:45.802
So, what instigated it? Do we know?

18:45.803 --> 18:47.571
Preston called you a liar.

18:47.572 --> 18:48.572
Seriously?

18:48.573 --> 18:50.207
The kid watches cable news?

18:50.208 --> 18:51.542
He was protecting your honor.

18:51.543 --> 18:54.278
Could've used him at my
last Congressional hearing.

18:54.279 --> 18:56.079
(laughs)

18:56.080 --> 18:57.514
So now what?

18:57.515 --> 18:59.550
Oh, I have a meeting
tomorrow with Dean Ward,

18:59.551 --> 19:02.252
and, uh, Sugar Ray is cooling
his jets in his room.

19:02.253 --> 19:03.320
How was your flight?

19:03.321 --> 19:04.454
Smooth.

19:04.455 --> 19:06.256
I wish I could say the
same for the traffic.

19:06.257 --> 19:07.991
Well, be careful over there, okay?

19:07.992 --> 19:09.726
I will.

19:09.727 --> 19:10.727
I love you.

19:10.728 --> 19:12.029
I like you okay, too.

19:12.030 --> 19:14.230
(chuckles) Bye.

19:14.965 --> 19:18.200
(lively conversation, music playing)

19:35.185 --> 19:37.453
(wind whistling)

19:45.662 --> 19:47.431
Whew!

19:47.432 --> 19:48.865
Welcome to Turkey.

19:48.866 --> 19:50.234
It's just like old times, huh?

19:50.235 --> 19:53.837
Yeah, it beats lying around at
home in my sliced-open bed.

19:53.838 --> 19:57.808
Got to admire how
thorough they are though.

19:57.809 --> 19:58.709
Too soon?

19:58.710 --> 19:59.710
Yeah.

19:59.711 --> 20:00.978
What do you got for me?

20:00.979 --> 20:03.079
Okay.

20:04.181 --> 20:06.383
This backpack Samila was
carrying when she died.

20:06.384 --> 20:09.353
My contact at the Turkish
National Police says

20:09.354 --> 20:11.622
they recovered a laptop in it.

20:11.623 --> 20:14.490
- Do they know what's on it?
- No. It's encrypted.

20:15.325 --> 20:17.461
Well... with Samila out of the picture,

20:17.462 --> 20:20.264
that may be our only hope for a
lead in the Marsh investigation.

20:20.265 --> 20:23.432
Or it can screw us if it
falls into the wrong hands.

20:35.079 --> 20:36.914
Madam Secretary.

20:36.915 --> 20:39.450
I wish I could say it's
nice to finally meet you.

20:39.451 --> 20:42.118
Minister Canoglu, I wish you could, too.

20:43.621 --> 20:45.122
I heard whispers that you were

20:45.123 --> 20:47.658
going to come here on your
very first trip abroad.

20:47.659 --> 20:51.429
Now you're here on... damage control.

20:51.430 --> 20:54.031
Actually, I'd like to skip
the damage control,

20:54.032 --> 20:55.933
and talk about Samila Mahdavi.

20:55.934 --> 20:57.868
The dead Iranian woman?

20:57.869 --> 21:00.805
She had a laptop in her
possession when she died.

21:00.806 --> 21:02.206
I'd like to have access to it.

21:02.207 --> 21:04.775
And I thought you were here
on a goodwill mission,

21:04.776 --> 21:06.177
to retrieve your citizen's body

21:06.178 --> 21:09.447
and heal the breach in our relations.

21:09.448 --> 21:10.881
I'd like to get to that, too.

21:10.882 --> 21:12.516
But first, I need that laptop.

21:12.517 --> 21:14.018
You violated our sovereignty.

21:14.019 --> 21:16.053
Something you know we
would never do lightly.

21:16.054 --> 21:17.621
Two of my citizens are dead.

21:17.622 --> 21:19.056
Which we deeply regret.

21:19.057 --> 21:22.192
Yet all you seem to
care about is... a laptop!

21:23.527 --> 21:25.363
We were betrayed,

21:25.364 --> 21:27.698
by the same murderers
who killed your people.

21:27.699 --> 21:30.201
And that laptop can help me find them.

21:30.202 --> 21:32.003
(scoffs) Why not run another operation?

21:32.004 --> 21:33.971
Storm our National Police Station

21:33.972 --> 21:35.339
and take whatever you want.

21:35.340 --> 21:39.076
It would be more of a...
"bribe someone on the inside"

21:39.077 --> 21:40.444
type of situation.

21:40.445 --> 21:41.612
I was kind of hoping

21:41.613 --> 21:44.380
to do away with the covert ops.

21:45.883 --> 21:48.052
I believe you, Madam Secretary.

21:48.053 --> 21:51.389
But you're not the only party
interested in that laptop.

21:51.390 --> 21:55.993
Oh, I've been a very popular man today.

21:55.994 --> 21:57.962
The Iranian Foreign Minister

21:57.963 --> 22:00.498
sat in that very chair this afternoon.

22:00.499 --> 22:02.366
Zahed Javani?

22:02.367 --> 22:04.535
Since Samila Mahdavi
was an Iranian citizen,

22:04.536 --> 22:07.304
one could argue that Minister Javani

22:07.305 --> 22:09.140
has a stronger claim
to her possessions, no?

22:09.141 --> 22:10.341
Okay...

22:10.342 --> 22:11.542
(clears throat)

22:11.543 --> 22:13.577
What do you want?

22:13.578 --> 22:16.347
My country has a great
appetite for natural gas.

22:16.348 --> 22:20.451
And right now, our
closest supply is... Iran.

22:20.452 --> 22:23.054
You really want to
make a deal with Iran?

22:23.055 --> 22:25.523
You're on opposite sides
of the fight in Syria.

22:25.524 --> 22:27.491
We're both on the side of profit.

22:27.492 --> 22:29.425
Ah.

22:30.461 --> 22:33.363
Maybe I can offer you
an alternative package.

22:34.532 --> 22:36.067
American gas,

22:36.068 --> 22:39.702
at a considerable discount.

22:41.172 --> 22:43.439
I'll take it to President Kozlu.

22:45.076 --> 22:46.744
Jason knocked Preston's
septum out of alignment.

22:46.745 --> 22:48.712
He'll need corrective surgery.

22:48.713 --> 22:51.781
Wait, you mean a nose job?

22:53.484 --> 22:54.952
I'm-I'm just clar... I'm just clarifying.

22:54.953 --> 22:57.254
I mean surgery so he can breathe.

22:57.255 --> 22:58.656
Is that enough clarification?

22:58.657 --> 23:00.257
HENRY: Yes, it is.

23:00.258 --> 23:02.993
Look, Dean Ward, Jason
feels terrible about this.

23:02.994 --> 23:04.829
Do you, Jason?

23:04.830 --> 23:06.229
I don't know.

23:07.031 --> 23:08.999
What?

23:09.000 --> 23:10.734
Okay, okay. He bullied me online

23:10.735 --> 23:12.203
and then he bullied me in school.

23:12.204 --> 23:13.137
That is true.

23:13.138 --> 23:15.172
Still no excuse for violence.

23:15.173 --> 23:17.775
As you know, Dr. McCord,
this is a Quaker school.

23:17.776 --> 23:19.944
We have zero tolerance for
violence of any kind.

23:19.945 --> 23:21.846
Which my wife and I greatly appreciate.

23:21.847 --> 23:23.747
We'd like to offer to
compensate Preston's parents

23:23.748 --> 23:25.149
for all their expenses.

23:25.150 --> 23:27.651
But what can Jason do

23:27.652 --> 23:28.819
to make this right?

23:28.820 --> 23:30.020
A formal apology to Preston.

23:30.021 --> 23:30.921
No way.

23:30.922 --> 23:31.989
Jason...

23:31.990 --> 23:35.392
WARD: A heartfelt apology.

23:35.393 --> 23:37.794
Otherwise, he'll be expelled.

23:49.306 --> 23:50.774
(sighs)

23:50.775 --> 23:53.509
Thank you for arranging this.

24:01.118 --> 24:03.486
♪

24:24.608 --> 24:26.476
Can you...?

24:33.184 --> 24:34.951
(gasps)

24:37.188 --> 24:39.989
(sobs)

24:41.058 --> 24:42.692
Oh...

24:44.061 --> 24:46.630
(sobbing)

24:46.631 --> 24:49.098
Oh, my God.

24:50.901 --> 24:53.202
(sobbing)

25:07.384 --> 25:08.852
Um...

25:08.853 --> 25:12.088
"Intrinsic.."

25:13.390 --> 25:14.458
Rough day?

25:14.459 --> 25:15.759
I can handle a rough day.

25:15.760 --> 25:18.229
Okay? That was getting eaten alive.

25:18.230 --> 25:20.364
I mean, the secretary
kept me in the dark

25:20.365 --> 25:21.432
about Istanbul.

25:21.433 --> 25:23.934
Served me up like chum to piranhas.

25:23.935 --> 25:25.135
What?

25:25.136 --> 25:26.136
Nothing.

25:26.137 --> 25:27.770
Wait, what's with the weird face?

25:34.245 --> 25:37.548
I probably shouldn't tell you this...

25:37.549 --> 25:39.850
but a couple months ago,

25:39.851 --> 25:43.354
the boss had me feed false
information to Russell Jackson.

25:43.355 --> 25:45.122
What do you mean?

25:45.123 --> 25:48.259
I mean like a double
agent kind of thing.

25:48.260 --> 25:49.592
About what?

25:50.494 --> 25:51.528
Dubai.

25:51.529 --> 25:53.230
She had me tell him

25:53.231 --> 25:55.699
that she mentioned Dubai
to Ambassador Dori

25:55.700 --> 25:56.700
at that Israeli coffee.

25:56.701 --> 25:57.735
What about it?

25:57.736 --> 25:59.303
I have no clue.

25:59.304 --> 26:01.805
And honestly, Th-this whole
thing has me freaked out.

26:01.806 --> 26:03.207
This isn't good.

26:03.208 --> 26:04.642
I mean, if our boss is spying

26:04.643 --> 26:05.909
on the president's chief of staff,

26:05.910 --> 26:07.011
what else could she be hiding?

26:07.012 --> 26:10.381
Covert ops in Istanbul?

26:10.382 --> 26:11.981
Maybe they're connected.

26:19.723 --> 26:21.825
Zahed.

26:21.826 --> 26:23.260
Secretary McCord.

26:23.261 --> 26:26.930
I did not expect to see you in Ankara.

26:26.931 --> 26:30.099
Didn't expect or, uh, hoped not to?

26:31.568 --> 26:34.171
However this plays out,

26:34.172 --> 26:36.640
please know that it is
my country's priority

26:36.641 --> 26:38.876
that our peace talks stay on track.

26:38.877 --> 26:41.078
Really?

26:41.079 --> 26:42.413
After what you've done?

26:42.414 --> 26:44.948
Look, our interest in Samila Mahdavi

26:44.949 --> 26:46.617
is about a specific investigation.

26:46.618 --> 26:47.818
That's why we want

26:47.819 --> 26:48.886
the laptop.

26:48.887 --> 26:50.854
Then why did your people
need to grab her?

26:50.855 --> 26:52.589
Well, we had a few questions.

26:52.590 --> 26:54.358
Why?

26:54.359 --> 26:58.862
You know that I cannot
tell you those specifics.

26:58.863 --> 27:02.132
I'm not asking about your
so-called investigation.

27:02.133 --> 27:05.102
Why would you need to
kidnap your own asset?

27:05.103 --> 27:06.203
What?

27:06.204 --> 27:07.638
No, she's... she's not one of ours.

27:07.639 --> 27:11.408
It's amazing how you just
lie right to my face.

27:11.409 --> 27:13.010
I-I... I'm not lying, I...

27:13.011 --> 27:14.011
She's dead.

27:14.012 --> 27:15.713
We've been through her things.

27:15.714 --> 27:17.548
Did you actually think
we would not find out?

27:17.549 --> 27:19.650
She-she was VEVAK.

27:19.651 --> 27:20.851
Yes.

27:20.852 --> 27:22.286
And turned by the CIA.

27:22.287 --> 27:24.521
We found proof in her
apartment in Tehran.

27:24.522 --> 27:26.856
And evidence of a plot against us.

27:28.726 --> 27:30.227
It is useless to pretend.

27:30.228 --> 27:31.428
I'm not pretending.

27:31.429 --> 27:33.464
I don't believe you.

27:33.465 --> 27:35.132
Tell your president

27:35.133 --> 27:36.900
we are withdrawing
from the peace talks.

27:36.901 --> 27:39.136
If it is war you want,

27:39.137 --> 27:41.771
then war is what you're going to get.

27:46.043 --> 27:48.344
(exhales)

27:58.594 --> 27:59.694
MUNSEY: Elizabeth.

27:59.695 --> 28:00.962
My assistant said it's urgent.

28:00.963 --> 28:02.163
What's up?

28:02.164 --> 28:03.665
Just had an interesting meeting

28:03.666 --> 28:05.967
with the Iranian Foreign Minister.

28:05.968 --> 28:07.769
Javani is in Ankara?

28:07.770 --> 28:10.305
Yeah.

28:10.306 --> 28:12.240
And he said

28:12.241 --> 28:15.377
that Samila Mahdavi
is working for the CIA.

28:15.378 --> 28:19.281
And you're thinking Juliet
could've been running her.

28:19.282 --> 28:21.182
That's where I've been going with it.

28:21.183 --> 28:22.517
As a rogue asset.

28:22.518 --> 28:23.985
Is that even possible?

28:23.986 --> 28:25.520
At this point? (scoffs)

28:25.521 --> 28:28.556
That's what I was afraid of.

28:28.557 --> 28:30.625
He also said something

28:30.626 --> 28:33.295
about Mahdavi being involved in a plot

28:33.296 --> 28:35.330
against the Iranian
government. I mean...

28:35.331 --> 28:36.731
Do you think that

28:36.732 --> 28:39.100
that's what this whole
thing could be about?

28:39.101 --> 28:40.435
I'll get into it.

28:40.436 --> 28:43.972
Still waiting to hear back from Canoglu

28:43.973 --> 28:45.840
about our offer for the laptop.

28:45.841 --> 28:48.209
Give them whatever they want.

28:48.210 --> 28:49.911
Oh, trust me.

28:49.912 --> 28:51.713
I'm not leaving here without it.

28:51.714 --> 28:54.282
I'll give them Hawaii if I have to.

28:54.283 --> 28:56.685
We've been following
the threads on Juliet,

28:56.686 --> 28:58.320
looking for a connection
to Secretary Marsh.

28:58.321 --> 29:00.388
As far as we can tell, they never met.

29:00.389 --> 29:02.557
That could simply be good trade-craft.

29:02.558 --> 29:04.259
We'll keep at it.

29:04.260 --> 29:06.761
And try to find any
connection to Mahdavi.

29:06.762 --> 29:09.230
Well, please do.

29:09.231 --> 29:13.234
Without any proof that we
weren't plotting against them,

29:13.235 --> 29:16.970
I think our nuclear deal
with the Iranians is dead.

29:19.040 --> 29:20.475
So we have some secret trip abroad,

29:20.476 --> 29:22.811
all while denying that
anything's going on in Turkey,

29:22.812 --> 29:24.479
even though a video clearly shows

29:24.480 --> 29:26.247
that something is going on in Turkey.

29:26.248 --> 29:28.717
And some long con with the
president's chief of staff.

29:28.718 --> 29:29.918
Maybe we're just overreacting.

29:29.919 --> 29:31.353
You mean I'm overreacting.

29:31.354 --> 29:32.220
Basically.

29:32.221 --> 29:33.722
Okay, so, what?

29:33.723 --> 29:35.790
Now you're okay with our
little culture of secrecy?

29:35.791 --> 29:38.426
No. But maybe that's just
the way this town works.

29:38.427 --> 29:40.862
You do your job,

29:40.863 --> 29:42.597
cross your fingers, hope that your boss

29:42.598 --> 29:45.332
isn't strangling puppies
in some dark alley.

29:48.269 --> 29:49.337
What?

29:49.338 --> 29:50.372
I'm getting another drink.

29:50.373 --> 29:52.272
Oh, come...

29:53.441 --> 29:55.676
- DAISY: Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

29:58.880 --> 29:59.948
Oh... (laughs)

29:59.949 --> 30:02.217
And I had you pegged for a vodka woman.

30:02.218 --> 30:04.619
There's a lot you don't
know about me, Greg.

30:04.620 --> 30:06.421
Oh.

30:06.422 --> 30:07.822
Well, I know that you're worried

30:07.823 --> 30:09.224
about becoming the next Ron Ziegler.

30:09.225 --> 30:11.693
Reputation ruined,

30:11.694 --> 30:13.161
all because you had to lie

30:13.162 --> 30:16.564
about a mistake in front of the camera.

30:16.565 --> 30:20.534
Okay, off the record,
you might be right.

30:22.370 --> 30:24.039
What if it's more than that?

30:24.040 --> 30:25.640
What do you mean?

30:25.641 --> 30:27.042
Look at Iran-Contra.

30:27.043 --> 30:28.376
Wait, indictments?

30:28.377 --> 30:30.477
Big fires always start small.

30:34.049 --> 30:36.251
You want a piece of free advice?

30:36.252 --> 30:38.420
Write a memo to yourself every day.

30:38.421 --> 30:39.954
Put down exactly what you know.

30:39.955 --> 30:42.556
And hire a lawyer.

30:45.093 --> 30:46.594
President Kozlu has accepted your offer

30:46.595 --> 30:48.763
of discounted natural gas
from the United States.

30:48.764 --> 30:50.932
I'm happy to hear that. Thank you.

30:50.933 --> 30:52.967
In exchange, we will release

30:52.968 --> 30:55.737
the body of your citizen, Mr. Brett Boris,

30:55.738 --> 30:58.840
and, uh, issue a clarification

30:58.841 --> 31:00.475
regarding the attack in Istanbul.

31:00.476 --> 31:02.343
That absolves the CIA?

31:02.344 --> 31:03.778
That says, uh,

31:03.779 --> 31:05.413
the investigation is
moving on other parties.

31:05.414 --> 31:06.648
Good enough.

31:06.649 --> 31:09.751
As for the, uh, gas deal,

31:09.752 --> 31:12.287
I'll announce it at a date of my choosing

31:12.288 --> 31:14.022
within the next six months.

31:14.023 --> 31:17.659
Then all we have to do is
enjoy our tea in peace.

31:17.660 --> 31:20.494
Not quite. And also Ms.
Mahdavi's laptop.

31:22.030 --> 31:23.431
Ah, yes.

31:23.432 --> 31:27.268
I'm afraid that was a bridge too far.

31:27.269 --> 31:28.636
"A bridge too far"?

31:28.637 --> 31:30.939
That was exactly the
bridge we negotiated.

31:30.940 --> 31:33.308
I could not have been
more clear about that.

31:33.309 --> 31:34.476
You will accept this modification

31:34.477 --> 31:35.810
because you need to protect your CIA.

31:35.811 --> 31:37.512
Modifica...? Ozan...

31:37.513 --> 31:39.814
The Iranians are no friend to Turkey,

31:39.815 --> 31:41.549
but we wanted to keep our options open.

31:41.550 --> 31:43.218
We'll make a counteroffer.

31:43.219 --> 31:44.886
It's already done.

31:44.887 --> 31:47.021
Mahdavi's body and all her
possessions are going to Javani.

31:47.022 --> 31:49.057
Then you need to get me a
copy of that hard drive.

31:49.058 --> 31:50.125
No.

31:50.126 --> 31:51.793
They'll know we tampered with it.

31:51.794 --> 31:53.495
Look, the decision is final.

31:53.496 --> 31:55.463
- Now do we have a deal or not?
- Not quite.

31:55.464 --> 31:56.898
I'm gonna speak with President Kozlu.

31:56.899 --> 31:58.265
This was his idea.

32:00.502 --> 32:03.837
Never violate our sovereignty again.

32:09.344 --> 32:11.412
JASON: <i>We really have to do this?</i>

32:11.413 --> 32:13.014
Yep. You can't duck her forever, dude.

32:13.015 --> 32:14.415
Mom's fine. You're the hypocrite.

32:14.416 --> 32:16.217
- What... Excuse me?
- What?

32:16.218 --> 32:18.219
What? I saw how you manhandled that guy

32:18.220 --> 32:20.188
who was talking smack about
Mom in the restaurant.

32:20.189 --> 32:23.024
Okay, that guy was drunk and in uniform.

32:23.025 --> 32:24.359
And I didn't break his nose.

32:24.360 --> 32:25.793
Okay, I get it, Dad.

32:25.794 --> 32:27.328
- Two sets of rules.
- What? Uh-uh.

32:27.329 --> 32:28.329
No, no. No.

32:28.330 --> 32:30.265
Two completely different circumstances.

32:30.266 --> 32:32.534
And, by the way, I don't have
to explain myself to you.

32:32.535 --> 32:34.502
Yep, and you don't have
to listen to me either.

32:34.503 --> 32:36.638
- What are you talking about?
- Dad...

32:36.639 --> 32:38.006
I'm right here.

32:38.007 --> 32:39.474
- (video call ringing)
- Oh, okay.

32:39.475 --> 32:40.907
We're not done with this.

32:42.377 --> 32:43.645
Hey.

32:43.646 --> 32:45.914
You guys are a sight for sore eyes.

32:45.915 --> 32:47.649
You see me okay?

32:47.650 --> 32:48.950
HENRY: Yeah, you look great, babe.

32:48.951 --> 32:50.218
JASON: Yeah, we see you fine.

32:50.219 --> 32:51.219
Good.

32:51.220 --> 32:53.388
'Cause I want you to read my lips:

32:53.389 --> 32:56.089
you are going to apologize.

32:57.258 --> 32:58.660
But I'm not sorry.

32:58.661 --> 33:01.095
You're not sorry about
breaking another kid's nose?

33:01.096 --> 33:02.897
No, no...

33:02.898 --> 33:05.099
Okay, I am sorry I hurt him that bad.

33:05.100 --> 33:06.067
Good. You should be.

33:06.068 --> 33:07.235
You lost control.

33:07.236 --> 33:08.336
And no amount of self-righteous anger

33:08.337 --> 33:09.337
can justify that.

33:09.338 --> 33:10.705
(sighs)

33:10.706 --> 33:12.140
Okay.

33:12.141 --> 33:13.908
Okay, I will apologize.

33:13.909 --> 33:15.977
But only for punching him.

33:15.978 --> 33:18.313
Not for defending Mom.

33:18.314 --> 33:21.482
I can live with that.

33:21.483 --> 33:22.550
Professor?

33:22.551 --> 33:24.085
Yeah, that works for me.

33:24.086 --> 33:25.453
All right, great.

33:25.454 --> 33:26.821
I got to go.

33:26.822 --> 33:28.923
I love you two and I'll
see you tomorrow, okay?

33:28.924 --> 33:29.958
Bye.

33:29.959 --> 33:32.559
- Love you. Bye.
- Love you. Bye.

33:33.494 --> 33:35.330
That was quick.

33:35.331 --> 33:36.998
So what's on your mind?

33:36.999 --> 33:38.633
I'm listening.

33:38.634 --> 33:40.001
Nothing.

33:40.002 --> 33:41.769
Okay, well, then you can't complain

33:41.770 --> 33:43.705
- about me not listening.
- Okay.

33:43.706 --> 33:46.106
All right.

33:59.921 --> 34:02.589
(tires screech)

34:04.826 --> 34:07.095
- MAN: Get down, Madam Secretary.
- Secure the secretary!

34:07.096 --> 34:09.581
Drop your weapon! Do it now!

34:17.138 --> 34:19.407
No, no, no. W-Wait, wait, wait, wait!

34:19.408 --> 34:22.909
Stand down! Stand down!

34:23.710 --> 34:25.512
Zahed?

34:27.014 --> 34:29.684
Maybe you want to call first next time.

34:29.685 --> 34:32.018
Madam Secretary?

34:32.687 --> 34:35.322
I'm glad I caught you.

34:35.324 --> 34:37.558
The contents of Samila Mahdavi's laptop.

34:37.559 --> 34:39.327
Why are you giving this to me?

34:39.328 --> 34:40.828
Didn't you think I was lying?

34:40.829 --> 34:42.130
I was wrong.

34:42.130 --> 34:44.431
You'll see.

34:48.101 --> 34:52.540
There are forces in both of our
countries trying to foment war.

34:52.541 --> 34:56.610
Once, at the Canadian Embassy,
we found a way to defeat them.

34:56.612 --> 34:58.212
I would like to believe

34:58.213 --> 35:00.814
that by working together
we can do so again.

35:30.378 --> 35:31.393
NADINE: <i>Okay.</i>

35:31.394 --> 35:33.895
Here's our official story.

35:33.896 --> 35:37.332
The secretary was in Turkey to
clear up the misunderstanding

35:37.333 --> 35:39.601
regarding events in Istanbul.

35:39.602 --> 35:43.571
The Turks are withdrawing their
accusation of CIA involvement,

35:43.572 --> 35:47.575
and Brett Boris's body is coming home.

35:47.576 --> 35:49.477
What did we give them?

35:49.478 --> 35:52.113
Nothing, as far as we're concerned.

35:52.114 --> 35:54.782
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

35:57.152 --> 35:58.687
Yes, Daisy?

35:58.688 --> 36:00.588
I don't know if I can spin that story.

36:00.589 --> 36:02.490
Of course you can.

36:02.491 --> 36:04.225
Okay, let me rephrase.

36:04.226 --> 36:06.194
I don't know if I'm willing to.

36:06.195 --> 36:09.664
Then we have a problem.

36:09.665 --> 36:11.965
Yeah.

36:19.641 --> 36:21.076
Dead man sitting.

36:21.077 --> 36:22.444
(laughter)

36:22.445 --> 36:24.012
Don't pay any attention
to those little jerks.

36:24.013 --> 36:25.246
Yeah, ahead of you on that one.

36:25.247 --> 36:26.314
- Hello?
- Hey.

36:26.315 --> 36:28.149
Hi.

36:28.150 --> 36:30.318
How's our little reprobate?

36:30.319 --> 36:33.488
He's ready to be saved,
whether he likes it or not.

36:33.489 --> 36:35.323
Well, I'm good either way.

36:35.324 --> 36:37.325
Were you good when Dad
roughed up that Marine guy

36:37.326 --> 36:38.693
- who was talking crap about you?
- Jason.

36:38.694 --> 36:40.028
What Marine... what Marine guy?

36:40.029 --> 36:41.663
Okay, there was this drunk...

36:41.664 --> 36:43.665
- Look, it was months ago.
- What? A Marine guy?

36:43.666 --> 36:45.400
And-and I didn't want to upset you.

36:45.401 --> 36:47.102
- You just started the job...
- Dad, when I got into it with Preston,

36:47.103 --> 36:48.737
I just did what I thought you would do.

36:48.738 --> 36:51.072
- Oh, well, now I know why you didn't
tell me. - Are you kidding, Jason?

36:51.073 --> 36:53.041
- Because clearly you had it handled.
- Look, I made a judgment call.

36:53.042 --> 36:54.976
- And I thought... - Oh, and I'm so
glad it didn't come back to bite...

36:54.977 --> 36:56.377
Do you really want to do this right now?

36:56.378 --> 36:58.346
- Henry, I... Right now?
- I mean, he's...

36:58.347 --> 37:00.148
- he's about to go in front...
- Why didn't you tell me then?

37:00.149 --> 37:01.149
- I can't even...
- Because I...

37:01.150 --> 37:03.184
WARD: Excuse me?

37:03.185 --> 37:05.253
McCords, we're ready for you.

37:05.254 --> 37:07.422
Oh, good.

37:07.423 --> 37:09.723
Great. We're ready.

37:12.660 --> 37:15.263
Jason, in the spirit
of Westmore's founders,

37:15.264 --> 37:16.831
and in accordance with the honor code,

37:16.832 --> 37:17.932
are you willing

37:17.933 --> 37:20.500
to shake hands and apologize?

37:25.607 --> 37:28.342
Preston?

37:32.380 --> 37:35.316
I'm sorry about your nose, Preston.

37:35.317 --> 37:37.452
But I'm not sorry I stood up to you.

37:37.453 --> 37:40.755
Jason, you owe Preston
an unreserved apology.

37:40.756 --> 37:41.990
He made fun of my mom.

37:41.991 --> 37:43.691
This is your last chance.

37:43.692 --> 37:45.059
Well, Dean Ward, if I may. Well...

37:45.060 --> 37:46.928
- You may not.
- Jason did just apologize.

37:46.929 --> 37:48.830
Your son is expelled.

37:48.831 --> 37:50.999
- Seriously?
- Hey! What?!

37:51.000 --> 37:52.834
Did you not hear him apologize?

37:52.835 --> 37:54.135
- He didn't mean it.
- ELIZABETH: Really?

37:54.136 --> 37:55.270
So you read his mind?

37:55.271 --> 37:56.638
Madam Secretary...

37:56.639 --> 37:58.640
ELIZABETH: Because if you
can do that, I am sure

37:58.641 --> 38:00.809
that the CIA would be thrilled

38:00.810 --> 38:01.943
to learn your technique.

38:01.944 --> 38:03.745
This is a Quaker school.

38:03.746 --> 38:04.779
Nonviolence is

38:04.780 --> 38:06.514
- one of our core values.
- So is integrity.

38:06.515 --> 38:08.349
Our son is following his conscience.

38:08.350 --> 38:09.818
And you behaving like a tyrant

38:09.819 --> 38:12.287
is in direct contradiction
to the basic precepts

38:12.288 --> 38:13.521
of the Quaker faith.

38:13.522 --> 38:14.756
World-renowned religious scholar.

38:14.757 --> 38:15.924
Nailed it.

38:15.925 --> 38:17.358
I think it's time for you to leave.

38:17.359 --> 38:18.660
- Really? That...
- Okay, wait a minute.

38:18.661 --> 38:20.261
Let's just be reasonable.

38:20.262 --> 38:21.563
You're not expelling, Jason.

38:21.564 --> 38:23.231
Madam Secretary, I'm sure you're used

38:23.232 --> 38:25.066
to getting your way at
the State Department,

38:25.067 --> 38:26.167
but I'm in charge here.

38:26.168 --> 38:27.302
That's cute.

38:27.303 --> 38:28.703
But if I ran the State Department

38:28.704 --> 38:30.038
the way you run this school,

38:30.039 --> 38:31.973
the world would be a smoldering ember.

38:31.974 --> 38:33.274
- Uh, babe, that's enough.
- Okay.

38:33.275 --> 38:34.909
Get out or I'm calling security.

38:34.910 --> 38:37.478
- Oh, really? Are you sure you
want to do that? - Honestly?

38:37.479 --> 38:40.148
'Cause I don't like their
odds against my detail.

38:40.149 --> 38:42.283
I mean, given the whole,
you know, nonviolent thing.

38:42.284 --> 38:44.185
- HENRY: Come on, we're leaving.
- ELIZABETH: This is not over.

38:44.186 --> 38:46.754
I'm going to take this up
with the Quaker Association

38:46.755 --> 38:48.056
- Board... thing.
- Westmore is independent.

38:48.057 --> 38:49.957
- Whatever!
- (door slams)

38:52.293 --> 38:54.295
Well, at least things
went well in Turkey.

38:54.296 --> 38:55.997
Yeah.

38:55.998 --> 38:58.633
I'm better with international dictators.

38:58.634 --> 39:00.268
I'm sorry I didn't tell you

39:00.269 --> 39:01.703
about that incident with the Marine.

39:01.704 --> 39:03.805
It's all right.

39:03.806 --> 39:04.973
So you got everything?

39:04.974 --> 39:07.308
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry, buddy.

39:07.309 --> 39:09.444
Well, we don't think it was your fault.

39:09.445 --> 39:11.379
We thought your apology was fine.

39:11.380 --> 39:12.680
I knew it wouldn't be.

39:12.681 --> 39:14.549
It's in the code of conduct.

39:14.550 --> 39:17.051
Like Dean Ward said,
"an unreserved apology."

39:17.052 --> 39:19.821
What? Hang on. you
wanted to be expelled?

39:19.822 --> 39:20.955
Yeah.

39:20.956 --> 39:22.523
Jason, you have friends here.

39:22.524 --> 39:24.659
- There's even a girl you've been out with.
- No.

39:24.660 --> 39:28.463
N-Not like my friends in Virginia.

39:28.464 --> 39:31.766
Look, Preston's dad runs some
sort of charity with Bono.

39:31.767 --> 39:34.002
Every freakin' day, I have to hear about

39:34.003 --> 39:35.403
how hilarious Bono is.

39:35.404 --> 39:37.672
How his family went
on vacation with Bono.

39:37.673 --> 39:39.107
How he kicked Bono's ass at Foosball.

39:39.108 --> 39:40.475
Well, I might have punched him for that.

39:40.476 --> 39:41.676
Look, all the kids here

39:41.677 --> 39:44.078
talk about are their houses
in Aspen and Hong Kong,

39:44.079 --> 39:45.813
and what famous people
they pal around with.

39:45.814 --> 39:47.248
They literally argue over whose parents

39:47.249 --> 39:48.783
- are the most rich and...
- Oh, come on.

39:48.784 --> 39:50.985
It can't describe every student who goes...

39:50.986 --> 39:52.654
R-Really? It does?

39:52.655 --> 39:54.555
Look, I just, I really want to go

39:54.556 --> 39:56.456
to school with normal kids again.

39:58.226 --> 39:59.861
Well, uh, then good riddance.

39:59.862 --> 40:01.329
- 'Cause that's done.
- But, listen, next time,

40:01.330 --> 40:03.197
you don't have to bust anybody's nose

40:03.198 --> 40:04.565
- to get our attention, okay?
- No!

40:04.566 --> 40:06.100
Just... you think it'll be awkward

40:06.101 --> 40:07.568
with Alison still going here?

40:07.569 --> 40:08.937
- Oh, big-time.
- Yes, I do.

40:08.938 --> 40:10.138
- Yup.
- (sighs)

40:10.139 --> 40:13.007
(cell phone rings)

40:13.008 --> 40:15.209
Oh, guys, I got to get
back to the White House.

40:15.210 --> 40:16.544
(reporters clamoring)

40:16.545 --> 40:18.479
This was a dramatic reversal
on the part of the Turks.

40:18.480 --> 40:19.614
Why the sudden change of heart?

40:19.615 --> 40:20.915
Greg, this was a simple misunderstanding

40:20.916 --> 40:22.917
between two allies that's
now been corrected.

40:22.918 --> 40:24.452
Rather than assign blame,

40:24.453 --> 40:26.287
both Turkey and the United States

40:26.288 --> 40:28.122
are moving forward in a
combined effort to bring

40:28.123 --> 40:29.223
the men who committed
this crime to justice.

40:29.224 --> 40:31.092
WOMAN: Phoebe, one more question!

40:31.093 --> 40:33.594
ELIZABETH: The gas deal will be announced

40:33.595 --> 40:35.663
at the G-20 next month.

40:35.664 --> 40:39.367
By then, the bulk of this
controversy should be behind us.

40:39.368 --> 40:43.137
I guess you can fight
some fires with gas.

40:43.138 --> 40:44.973
Well done, Bess.

40:44.974 --> 40:47.841
I wish that were the end of it.

40:49.577 --> 40:51.079
Director Munsey is here.

40:51.080 --> 40:53.647
Send him in.

40:59.153 --> 41:01.656
Mr. President?

41:01.657 --> 41:02.957
Thanks, boys.

41:02.958 --> 41:04.758
I'll take it from here.

41:10.264 --> 41:12.266
What's the meaning of this, sir?

41:12.267 --> 41:14.002
You're a smart guy.

41:14.003 --> 41:15.702
You tell me.

41:19.173 --> 41:22.276
Juliet was not Samila's handler.

41:22.277 --> 41:23.511
You were.

41:23.512 --> 41:25.747
You can't be serious.

41:25.748 --> 41:28.316
But then we got too close,
and you had her killed.

41:28.317 --> 41:29.951
Where is this coming from?

41:29.952 --> 41:32.320
From the laptop Samila was carrying.

41:32.321 --> 41:35.656
There's dozens of encrypted
e-mails, Andrew.

41:35.657 --> 41:37.725
To you and from you.

41:37.726 --> 41:39.727
You had to know we'd
find out eventually.

41:39.728 --> 41:41.162
DALTON: It's time to start talking.

41:41.163 --> 41:43.831
You can begin with why you
murdered George Peters

41:43.832 --> 41:46.099
and Secretary Marsh.

41:47.769 --> 41:50.972
We all know that nothing on
that laptop will stand up

41:50.973 --> 41:53.006
in a court of law.

41:54.742 --> 41:56.477
20 years I mentored you.

41:56.478 --> 41:58.079
Brought you up from nothing.

41:58.080 --> 42:01.582
I handpicked you to
replace me at the Agency.

42:01.583 --> 42:03.651
And this is how you repay me?
With treason?

42:03.652 --> 42:07.088
Mr. President, on the day
you were inaugurated,

42:07.089 --> 42:09.190
you told me the core security objective

42:09.191 --> 42:12.260
of this administration
was a nuclear-free Iran.

42:12.261 --> 42:15.363
There are elements in
that nation and elsewhere

42:15.364 --> 42:19.033
who are prepared to deliver
that objective to you.

42:19.034 --> 42:20.601
And soon.

42:20.602 --> 42:22.970
I'm simply following your directive, sir.

42:22.971 --> 42:25.406
My God, Andrew.

42:25.407 --> 42:27.474
What have you done?

42:29.210 --> 42:31.379
He's talking...

42:31.380 --> 42:33.114
he's talking about a coup.

42:33.115 --> 42:34.482
Regime change.

42:34.483 --> 42:35.850
Wiping out the Ayatollahs

42:35.851 --> 42:37.085
once and for all.

42:37.086 --> 42:39.087
You son of a bitch.

42:39.088 --> 42:41.289
We're on the verge of
signing a peace deal

42:41.290 --> 42:42.723
with them for God's sake.

42:42.724 --> 42:44.692
That deal isn't worth the
paper it's printed on.

42:44.693 --> 42:46.627
Sure, it might buy us a few months,

42:46.628 --> 42:49.097
maybe even a few years,
but with the Ayatollahs

42:49.098 --> 42:52.800
still running things, Javani
and Shiraz aren't partners.

42:52.801 --> 42:54.168
They're puppets.

42:54.169 --> 42:55.803
You can still salvage this, sir.

42:55.804 --> 42:58.139
It's not too late to get on board.

42:58.140 --> 42:59.474
Forget it, Andrew.

42:59.475 --> 43:01.142
It's over.

43:01.143 --> 43:03.878
Not by a long shot, Mr. President.

43:03.879 --> 43:05.913
The coup is already in motion,

43:05.914 --> 43:08.548
and there's nothing
you can do to stop it.
