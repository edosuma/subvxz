FRANK: Van is dead.

00:14.375 --> 00:16.000
Fucking murdered an FBI agent.

00:16.083 --> 00:16.709
I want you to kill my father.

00:16.792 --> 00:18.000
Why me, Raymond?

00:18.083 --> 00:20.417
'Cause I want
the last person he sees

00:20.500 --> 00:21.750
to hate him as much as I do.

00:21.834 --> 00:24.333
It's all there.

00:24.417 --> 00:25.500
Where'd you get it?

00:25.583 --> 00:27.125
Ruth's foundation.

00:27.208 --> 00:27.583
Sully just called.

00:27.667 --> 00:29.750
It's been done.

00:29.834 --> 00:31.208
RAY:
I'll get your money.

00:31.291 --> 00:34.333
You got the wrong guy, pal.
What are you
talking about?

00:34.417 --> 00:35.041
And I can prove it.

00:35.125 --> 00:37.917
Seany boy, are you in there?

00:38.000 --> 00:39.083
Let me in.

00:39.166 --> 00:42.250
Mickey, please, help me.

00:42.333 --> 00:42.625
I can't, kid.

00:42.709 --> 00:43.792
(gunshot)

00:43.875 --> 00:45.834
What happened, Raymond?

00:45.917 --> 00:46.959
Sully.

00:47.041 --> 00:48.458
And Mickey's still alive.

00:48.542 --> 00:49.542
Ruth's money?

00:49.625 --> 00:50.208
Gone.

00:50.291 --> 00:52.417
We've unleashed a monster.

00:52.500 --> 00:53.333
He doesn't have a
passport. I'll find him.

00:55.375 --> 00:57.083
Do you think
Sully's coming for us?

00:57.166 --> 00:59.041
I'm going into town.
You take care of the kids.

00:59.125 --> 01:02.166
I can't let
you do that.
Are we in danger?

01:02.250 --> 01:03.375
BUNCHY:
Remember me?

01:03.458 --> 01:04.625
It's Brendan.

01:04.709 --> 01:05.917
We don't know each other.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.667
I'm sorry.
Are you?

01:07.750 --> 01:09.208
RAY:
What'd you do?

01:09.291 --> 01:10.750
It was an accident.

01:10.834 --> 01:12.000
What the fuck?

01:12.083 --> 01:13.291
I need help.

01:13.375 --> 01:14.458
Bunchy shot him.

01:14.542 --> 01:16.458
He won't take me
to the hospital.

01:16.542 --> 01:17.208
They don't know, do they?

01:17.291 --> 01:19.959
Shut up.
You never told them.

01:20.041 --> 01:21.417
I told you to shut up.

01:21.500 --> 01:22.500
I loved you.

01:23.500 --> 01:26.834
FRANCES:
So you took him
to the hospital?

01:26.917 --> 01:28.166
Yeah.

01:28.250 --> 01:29.542
Which hospital?

01:31.875 --> 01:33.792
I had Avi take the kids
to a hotel.

01:33.875 --> 01:35.166
Okay.
Ray, that priest--
what happened?

01:35.250 --> 01:37.625
Is that the one
that abused Bunchy?

01:37.709 --> 01:39.375
Wasn't only Bunch.

01:42.583 --> 01:43.959
No. No, no.

01:44.041 --> 01:46.041
Don't touch me.

you to come arrest me, Frank.

04:36.792 --> 04:37.834
What are you doing here?

04:37.917 --> 04:40.667
I thought you might need
your lawyer, motherfucker.

04:40.750 --> 04:42.125
Van was a good agent.

04:42.208 --> 04:44.458
A good American.
All right.

04:45.792 --> 04:46.667
(sighs)

04:46.750 --> 04:49.959
Let's go.

04:52.041 --> 04:54.542
You're not gonna
bring me in, Frank.

04:54.625 --> 04:56.834
'Cause you know
I didn't do it.

04:56.917 --> 04:59.208
You think I'd leave a body?

04:59.291 --> 05:01.125
You think I'm that stupid?

05:01.208 --> 05:02.750
I don't leave fucking evidence.

05:02.834 --> 05:04.083
That's not admissible.

05:04.166 --> 05:05.709
You haven't
Mirandized him.

05:05.792 --> 05:07.083
You pursue this, you're gonna
look like an asshole,

05:07.166 --> 05:09.542
and you're gonna
lose your pension.

05:09.625 --> 05:11.750
You want to be an asshole
with no pension,

05:11.834 --> 05:13.208
that's fine with me, Frank,

05:13.291 --> 05:15.083
but who's gonna support
those kids of yours?

05:15.166 --> 05:16.959
Do not fucking
do this to me, Ray.

05:17.041 --> 05:18.875
I think you're gonna
give me 12 hours,

05:18.959 --> 05:21.041
'cause you know
I'm telling the truth.

05:29.250 --> 05:30.625
(sighs)

05:34.792 --> 05:37.083
You're making
the right decision, Frank.

05:37.166 --> 05:38.667
12 hours.

06:07.792 --> 06:10.166
You all right?

06:12.333 --> 06:14.458
Thought I'd feel real bad after
what happened to Father Danny.

06:17.834 --> 06:18.709
But I don't.

06:21.709 --> 06:23.959
I'm glad he's gone.

06:24.041 --> 06:26.667
That way, he can't
do it to anyone else.

06:28.125 --> 06:32.458
That's right, Bunch.

06:33.542 --> 06:36.667
I'm gonna stay
at my apartment from now on.

06:37.875 --> 06:39.083
Good.

06:39.166 --> 06:40.834
Won't be mad?

06:40.917 --> 06:43.000
No. Course not.

06:43.083 --> 06:44.542
But you change your mind,

06:44.625 --> 06:47.083
you're welcome here any time,
you know that.

06:47.166 --> 06:49.500
Thanks, Ter.

06:57.333 --> 06:59.709
(waves sloshing)

07:05.333 --> 07:08.000
You are taking
advantage.

07:08.083 --> 07:09.834
Who do you think is gonna
pay for all of this?

07:09.917 --> 07:12.458
Dad?

07:12.542 --> 07:14.834
Dad's not here, Conor.

07:14.917 --> 07:17.583
You're gonna make
yourself sick.

07:17.667 --> 07:19.709
Plus, you're not even
hungry, you're sad.

07:19.792 --> 07:21.792
Bullshit. Sad about what?

07:21.875 --> 07:23.125
Mom and Dad.

07:23.208 --> 07:24.709
Why?

07:24.792 --> 07:28.166
Mom's upset, Dad's gone.

07:28.250 --> 07:31.208
Uh, we're staying in a hotel,
we're missing school.

07:31.291 --> 07:33.417
So what?
I don't even like school.

07:33.500 --> 07:36.583
If I was in Israel,
I'd be in the army right now.

07:36.667 --> 07:37.792
You are clueless.

07:37.875 --> 07:40.375
(scoffs)

07:44.917 --> 07:46.250
Mommy?

07:46.333 --> 07:49.000
Come on, it's
time to get up.

07:49.959 --> 07:53.291
Mom?

07:53.375 --> 07:55.834
Leave me alone, Bridget.

07:55.917 --> 07:57.083
Where's Dad?

07:57.166 --> 07:58.875
I don't know.

07:58.959 --> 08:02.375
When are we going home?

08:02.458 --> 08:02.959
Mom, you should get up.

08:03.041 --> 08:05.792
Leave me alone!

08:06.125 --> 08:07.834
(sighs)

08:07.917 --> 08:10.750
(sniffles)

08:13.792 --> 08:14.625
LENA:
You write that one down?
3832 Wilshire Blvd?

08:14.709 --> 08:16.959
Did you find
the "all you can eat" yet?

08:17.041 --> 08:18.041
We're working on it.

08:18.125 --> 08:20.750
How hard can it be?
Boss, there's a bunch of 'em.

08:20.834 --> 08:21.959
So narrow it down.

08:22.041 --> 08:23.000
Show his fucking picture.

08:23.083 --> 08:25.083
The guy weighs 300 pounds,
for Christ's sake.

08:25.166 --> 08:27.166
Everybody who eats in these
places weighs 300 pounds.

08:27.250 --> 08:30.291
We're running out of time,
all right?

08:30.375 --> 08:33.291
Okay. All right, look,
we're going now.

08:33.375 --> 08:35.083
We just had
to collect all the names.

08:35.166 --> 08:36.625
Maybe he meant
Third Street in Hollywood.

08:36.709 --> 08:37.250
No, they stayed in Santa Monica.

08:37.333 --> 08:39.417
He hides in plain sight.

08:39.500 --> 08:41.291
That's how he did it in Boston.

08:41.375 --> 08:42.917
He doesn't run,
he doesn't go far.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.583
He's right there.
Just fucking find him.

08:44.667 --> 08:46.125
Okay.
We will, Ray.

08:46.208 --> 08:47.500
I'll meet you
downstairs.
Yeah.

08:47.583 --> 08:49.583
You want me to
check on your family?

08:49.667 --> 08:51.750
No, they're all right.

08:51.834 --> 08:54.125
Did you call Abby?

08:54.208 --> 08:55.917
What are you,
my fucking marriage counselor?

08:56.000 --> 08:58.417
Go out there
and do your fucking job!

08:59.333 --> 09:01.583
(door slams)

09:07.834 --> 09:10.583
What the fuck are you doing?

09:11.417 --> 09:13.291
This is not
appropriate for me.

09:13.375 --> 09:16.000
I'm a sexual anorexic.

09:16.083 --> 09:18.291
Oh, come on.
Enough with that shit.

09:18.375 --> 09:21.417
Jesus.

09:21.500 --> 09:23.417
What the hell?

09:23.500 --> 09:25.792
You know what, Pop?

09:25.875 --> 09:28.875
I don't want you
here no more.

09:28.959 --> 09:30.709
I want my place back.

09:30.792 --> 09:34.166
Really?

09:41.709 --> 09:44.667
We have good times,
don't we, Bunch?

09:44.750 --> 09:46.875
I thought we were having
fun being together.

09:50.750 --> 09:51.834
All right, you know what?

09:51.917 --> 09:55.667
You take the bed,
have your privacy, you're right.

09:55.750 --> 09:57.959
I can move back out
to the couch.

09:58.041 --> 09:59.500
No.

09:59.583 --> 10:02.000
I want to live alone.

10:02.083 --> 10:03.333
Like a grown-up.

10:03.417 --> 10:04.875
I see.

10:04.959 --> 10:07.583
Well, just be careful
you don't burn it down.

10:07.667 --> 10:10.333
See? That's what
I'm talking about.

10:10.417 --> 10:12.709
Why you got to bring that up?

10:12.792 --> 10:14.875
It's just a bolt out of
the fucking blue, that's all.

10:14.959 --> 10:16.792
I told you
Father Danny was here.

10:16.875 --> 10:18.583
You should have
listened to me.

10:18.667 --> 10:22.083
This... this wouldn't
have happened.

10:22.166 --> 10:24.709
What wouldn't have happened?

10:26.417 --> 10:30.583
I got fucking drunk...

10:30.667 --> 10:32.291
and I shot him.

10:32.375 --> 10:34.333
You what?

10:34.417 --> 10:36.542
Ray had to take
care of it.

10:36.625 --> 10:40.083
He killed him
right in front of us.

10:40.166 --> 10:42.667
It really fucked up Terry.

10:42.750 --> 10:45.709
And it really fucked up me.

10:48.166 --> 10:49.125
How's Ray feel about it?

10:49.208 --> 10:51.458
I don't know.

10:51.542 --> 10:53.917
Why don't you fucking ask him?

10:54.000 --> 10:55.500
All right, I will.

10:56.583 --> 10:58.750
Jesus, ain't
that something.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.875
It was really him, huh?

11:09.000 --> 11:12.166
Maybe you're right.

11:12.250 --> 11:15.083
Maybe I am a bad influence.

11:15.166 --> 11:18.250
It's just a lot
of bad shit's been happening

11:18.333 --> 11:19.917
since you got here.

11:45.375 --> 11:47.500
How old are you?

11:49.250 --> 11:50.959
I'm 65.

11:51.041 --> 11:53.000
You got any I.D. on you?

11:53.083 --> 11:54.625
Like a... driver's license?

11:54.709 --> 11:56.125
Social Security card?

11:56.625 --> 11:58.208
Sure, I got I.D.

11:58.291 --> 12:00.458
You got cash?

12:03.125 --> 12:04.291
300 bucks?

12:04.375 --> 12:07.000
Let's go.

12:07.083 --> 12:08.959
(door creaks)

12:25.709 --> 12:26.834
(chuckles)

12:26.917 --> 12:27.417
You fucking kidding me?

12:27.500 --> 12:30.000
I want your wallet.

12:30.083 --> 12:31.000
And I want your sneakers.

12:45.583 --> 12:48.375
(grunting)

12:48.458 --> 12:50.291
WOMAN:
...roast the perfect turkey,

12:50.375 --> 12:51.875
preheat the oven to 325...

12:51.959 --> 12:53.667
Where's Eddie?

12:53.750 --> 12:56.625
I need him to go to the mall
and buy me new sneakers.

12:56.709 --> 12:58.208
You know how hard
these were to find?

12:58.291 --> 12:58.875
(keys clatter)

12:58.959 --> 13:00.000
(sighs)
My fucking feet.

13:02.792 --> 13:04.792
My arches just
keep collapsing.

13:05.750 --> 13:07.166
(sighs)

13:07.250 --> 13:09.417
Where is he?

13:10.375 --> 13:12.083
He left.

13:15.750 --> 13:16.417
He take the money?

13:16.500 --> 13:18.291
He only took one bag.

13:18.375 --> 13:20.250
He took one bag?!

13:20.333 --> 13:21.834
You fat fuck!
(shouts)

13:21.917 --> 13:24.333
You fat motherfucker!
(grunting)

13:24.417 --> 13:25.875
What the...
Huh?

13:25.959 --> 13:27.417
You're fucking dead!

13:27.500 --> 13:29.500
You fucking piece of shit!

13:29.583 --> 13:30.125
(sobbing)

13:33.583 --> 13:36.875
I just slit a guy's throat,
and all I got was a fucking...

13:36.959 --> 13:39.458
Ralphs card.

13:42.125 --> 13:44.709
Fuck am I gonna do?

13:46.750 --> 13:48.917
Well...

13:49.000 --> 13:50.709
now you're gonna have
to go to the mall

13:50.792 --> 13:53.208
and get me my new sneakers.

13:53.291 --> 13:56.834
All right.

13:56.917 --> 13:58.083
I got to eat, Sully;
I'm starving.

13:58.166 --> 14:01.083
Yeah. What, you're starving?
Jesus fucking...

14:01.166 --> 14:03.125
Okay, it's a size 12.
And, here, it...

14:06.166 --> 14:09.917
46 and a... half, U.K.

14:12.792 --> 14:15.959
Now, we get to the Maldives...

14:16.041 --> 14:19.291
this will be like a bad dream.

14:21.333 --> 14:22.291
You're still taking me?

14:22.375 --> 14:25.500
Yeah, fucking of course
I'm still taking you.

14:25.583 --> 14:27.166
You think I'm gonna...

14:27.250 --> 14:30.250
make friends
with the freakin' Maldivians?

14:30.333 --> 14:31.333
Learn a new fucking language?

14:31.417 --> 14:35.458
Forget it.

14:35.542 --> 14:37.458
I'm sorry I hit you
with the shoe.

14:37.542 --> 14:39.542
I got upset.
(scoffs)

14:39.625 --> 14:41.375
It was a cruel thing to do.

14:41.458 --> 14:42.417
Won't happen again.

14:42.500 --> 14:45.041
Okay, Sully.

14:45.125 --> 14:46.625
Okay.

14:46.709 --> 14:48.625
(exhales)

14:48.709 --> 14:51.083
(phone beeping)

14:55.333 --> 14:57.750
(ringtone playing)

15:04.375 --> 15:05.792
Hi, Grandpa.

15:05.875 --> 15:08.083
Conor, where's your dad?

15:08.166 --> 15:10.458
Uh, where he always is.
I don't know.

15:10.542 --> 15:12.500
How about your mom?

15:12.583 --> 15:14.083
Uh, we're at this big hotel.

15:14.166 --> 15:16.500
She's still in bed.
Something's wrong with her.

15:17.041 --> 15:20.125
What's the name of it?

15:35.083 --> 15:36.417
You all right?

15:36.917 --> 15:40.000
I lied to Frances.

15:41.834 --> 15:43.458
It's gonna tear us apart.

15:44.667 --> 15:47.250
Maybe not.
No.

15:47.333 --> 15:49.250
It will.

15:52.333 --> 15:54.834
We did what had to be done.

15:54.917 --> 15:56.792
Murder, Ray?

15:58.667 --> 16:00.500
I can't condone it.

16:05.083 --> 16:09.333
You should've told me
what happened to you.

16:09.417 --> 16:11.709
(chuckles)

16:13.625 --> 16:15.125
Yeah?

16:17.250 --> 16:20.792
You should've told somebody
when it happened to you.

16:20.875 --> 16:23.291
Might have
stopped him, Ter.

16:24.959 --> 16:28.000
I didn't know
what to make of it.

16:28.083 --> 16:31.500
I broke his fingers
and that was that.

16:34.125 --> 16:36.792
I didn't have words for it.

16:39.792 --> 16:41.125
I'm sorry.

16:49.166 --> 16:51.208
What do you want to do?

16:53.375 --> 16:54.875
About what?

16:54.959 --> 16:57.250
(sighs)

16:57.333 --> 16:59.291
The nurse.

17:02.291 --> 17:05.625
I think you got
to let her go, Ter.

17:06.333 --> 17:09.500
That's easy for you to say.

17:09.583 --> 17:12.375
You got a family.

17:12.458 --> 17:13.667
(door opens)

17:13.750 --> 17:15.625
(phone vibrating)

17:19.083 --> 17:19.542
Yeah.

17:19.625 --> 17:22.041
We found it.

17:22.125 --> 17:23.083
He comes every day
as soon as the buffet opens,

17:23.166 --> 17:24.917
and he's always
the first in line.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.333
Tell Avi to meet me there.

17:27.417 --> 17:30.750
Want you to go to that hotel
and check on my family.

17:30.834 --> 17:33.083
Right. The, uh...
place at the beach?

17:33.166 --> 17:34.583
Yeah. I'll call you later.

17:34.667 --> 17:37.208
All right, boss.

17:46.959 --> 17:48.375
(gasps)
What the fuck, Mick?!

17:48.458 --> 17:50.000
Oh, I'm... Abby.

17:50.083 --> 17:52.166
Me darlin'. I was...
I was waiting for you.

17:52.250 --> 17:53.125
(sighs)

17:53.208 --> 17:54.750
And I fell asleep.

17:54.834 --> 17:57.250
(sniffs)
The bed was so soft.

17:57.333 --> 18:00.542
Do you know how fucking
inappropriate this is?

18:00.625 --> 18:01.625
I didn't want to wake you.

18:01.709 --> 18:04.458
I didn't mean any harm.
I was talking to Conor.

18:04.542 --> 18:07.417
I, uh... I was worried
about you, so I came.

18:09.542 --> 18:10.500
Tired, I guess.
It's been a rough few days.

18:10.583 --> 18:12.542
Oh, yeah?

18:12.625 --> 18:14.208
Me, too.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.542
You want to talk about it,
I'm here for you.

18:26.291 --> 18:28.417
Does that pull out?

18:28.500 --> 18:29.417
You're not staying here, Mick.

18:32.750 --> 18:36.291
Well, whatever's going on,
right now you got to get up.

18:36.375 --> 18:38.333
Are you fucking kidding me?
No, I'm not.

18:38.417 --> 18:40.291
You got to be
a mother to your children.

18:40.375 --> 18:41.542
(chuckles)

18:41.625 --> 18:42.709
That's ironic coming from you.

18:42.792 --> 18:44.875
The past is the past.

18:44.959 --> 18:46.208
Right now... you're getting up.

18:46.291 --> 18:49.709
You lay your fucking hands
on me, and I'll scream.

18:49.792 --> 18:51.792
You need to get up.
Conor's upset.

18:51.875 --> 18:52.875
So is Bridget.
How do you know?

18:52.959 --> 18:54.000
I talked to him.

18:54.083 --> 18:55.041
You got some fucking nerve,

18:55.125 --> 18:56.041
you know that?

18:56.125 --> 18:58.041
I do. Go take a shower.

18:58.125 --> 18:59.625
You get up, I go.

18:59.709 --> 19:01.250
Go on.

19:08.333 --> 19:10.208
♪ ♪

19:28.333 --> 19:30.250
Fucking leave me alone.

19:30.333 --> 19:32.583
I'll fucking sue you.

19:45.834 --> 19:47.875
Fuck, Ray.

19:47.959 --> 19:48.875
(grunts)

19:48.959 --> 19:50.667
Relax, Tiny.

19:50.750 --> 19:52.291
You're not
going anywhere.

20:00.834 --> 20:02.792
You got a lot of problems, Tiny.

20:02.875 --> 20:04.250
Why don't you
let me help you?

20:04.333 --> 20:04.917
Go fuck yourself, Ray.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.250
Sully's gonna kill you.

20:07.333 --> 20:08.709
You know that, right?

20:10.917 --> 20:12.583
He's out of fucking control.

20:12.667 --> 20:14.125
So let me help you.

20:16.834 --> 20:17.625
We got Eddie, Tiny.

20:17.709 --> 20:20.667
You're just saying that
to scare me.

20:20.750 --> 20:23.125
Nah, he got
hit by a car.

20:23.208 --> 20:24.291
We got the money back.

20:24.375 --> 20:27.333
But you got another million
belongs to me.

20:31.333 --> 20:34.792
I didn't come to L.A.
to kill a fucking movie star.

20:34.875 --> 20:36.750
I... I been
watching this guy

20:36.834 --> 20:38.542
my whole life.

20:38.625 --> 20:40.208
I been crying nonstop.

20:40.291 --> 20:42.166
I fucking loved Sean Walker.

20:43.125 --> 20:46.250
Here's the deal.

20:46.333 --> 20:48.583
I'll let you keep
half the money,

20:48.667 --> 20:52.458
throw in a boat trip to
Rosarito, plus the passports.

20:52.542 --> 20:55.000
When you get to Mexico,
Sully can go anyplace he wants.

20:55.083 --> 20:58.000
I got contacts down there that
can get him to the Maldives.

21:00.125 --> 21:02.542
I don't trust him no more.

21:03.959 --> 21:06.875
Can I come work for you?

21:12.875 --> 21:14.500
(writing)

21:20.917 --> 21:23.166
Take Sully my offer.

21:23.250 --> 21:24.959
Call me
when it's done.

21:25.041 --> 21:25.875
I got no family, Ray.

21:25.959 --> 21:28.834
And-and I don't blend in.

21:28.917 --> 21:30.875
Sully ain't gonna
take me with him.

21:39.834 --> 21:41.750
Hi, sweet pea.

21:41.834 --> 21:43.208
Hi, Grandpa.

21:43.291 --> 21:45.041
Hi, honey.
(chuckles)

21:45.125 --> 21:48.041
(groans)
What's wrong with him?

21:48.125 --> 21:50.417
He ate too much.
Now he doesn't feel well.

21:50.500 --> 21:53.458
Oh. My sweet boy.

21:53.542 --> 21:56.542
How you doing?
CONOR: Not so good.

21:56.625 --> 21:57.792
BRIDGET:
Hi, Mama.

21:57.875 --> 21:59.625
You feel better?

21:59.709 --> 22:01.208
I do, sweetheart.

22:02.375 --> 22:04.667
Sorry I was short before.

22:04.750 --> 22:05.542
It's okay.
Don't worry about it.

22:08.625 --> 22:10.041
Will you order me
a ginger ale?

22:10.125 --> 22:10.625
I want to talk to Mick.

22:10.709 --> 22:13.291
Sure.

22:13.375 --> 22:15.000
Better order two;
your son's got a stomachache.

22:15.083 --> 22:15.917
What's wrong, Con?

22:16.000 --> 22:18.208
I'm fine.

22:18.291 --> 22:19.250
Maybe you need to fart.

22:19.333 --> 22:20.667
(laughs)

22:20.750 --> 22:21.792
(laughs)

22:21.875 --> 22:23.291
We go talk, Mick?

22:28.667 --> 22:30.500
Ain't this something?

22:30.583 --> 22:33.417
Finally have our day
at the beach? Huh?

22:37.333 --> 22:40.667
What are you
doing here, Mick?

22:40.750 --> 22:42.208
Wanted to make sure you...

22:42.291 --> 22:45.917
you were all okay,
that's all.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.625
You know Ray was abused?

22:48.709 --> 22:51.875
That same priest
that abused Bunchy?

22:53.792 --> 22:56.417
Yeah.

22:58.458 --> 23:02.792
(scoffs) That's all you
got to say about it?

23:05.917 --> 23:07.000
(sighs)

23:07.083 --> 23:08.625
Kids say the craziest things.

23:08.709 --> 23:10.625
You calling my
husband a liar, Mick?

23:10.709 --> 23:12.834
No, you...
It's just, you know...

23:12.917 --> 23:14.917
It was different then.
Different how?

23:15.000 --> 23:16.583
Everybody got molested.

23:16.667 --> 23:18.125
Half the kids in my neighborhood
got molested.

23:18.208 --> 23:21.125
Everybody knew about it.

23:21.208 --> 23:22.875
(chuckles)

23:22.959 --> 23:24.542
This-this one lady

23:24.625 --> 23:28.166
used to show me her tits
every fucking Sunday.

23:28.250 --> 23:29.917
Run her hands through my hair
every time she saw me.

23:30.000 --> 23:33.333
Pat my ass.

23:35.208 --> 23:37.500
(chuckles)

23:39.667 --> 23:41.375
You're the wolf.

23:41.458 --> 23:43.542
What?

23:43.625 --> 23:45.834
Ray was right.

23:45.917 --> 23:47.709
You're the fucking wolf, Mickey.

23:48.667 --> 23:51.792
I'm a wolf?
What is that supposed to mean?

23:51.875 --> 23:53.083
A wolf.

23:53.166 --> 23:53.834
A howling wolf?

23:53.917 --> 23:56.959
(howls)

24:00.583 --> 24:02.542
Look.

24:02.625 --> 24:06.625
Maybe I looked the other way
too much. Maybe I did.

24:06.709 --> 24:08.375
I'm just saying,
I had my hands full.

24:08.458 --> 24:11.041
You know how hard it was
to make a living?

24:11.125 --> 24:12.250
Selling coke?

24:13.834 --> 24:15.041
(chuckles)

24:15.125 --> 24:16.667
Yeah, that must've been
real hard.

24:16.750 --> 24:18.750
Geez, I can't
tell you nothing, can I?

24:18.834 --> 24:20.458
What the fuck is going on today?

24:20.542 --> 24:23.000
I want you to leave, Mickey.

24:23.709 --> 24:26.375
Stay away from
my family.

24:26.458 --> 24:28.083
Abby, come on.

24:28.166 --> 24:29.208
I thought we were friends.

24:29.291 --> 24:31.959
You wrote to me; all those
letters helped me so much.

24:32.041 --> 24:35.917
You know how much it meant to me
keeping up with those kids?

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
I love those kids.

24:38.083 --> 24:39.667
I really do.

24:39.750 --> 24:42.750
Why don't you love
your own kids, Mick?

24:44.291 --> 24:46.834
I don't get this, Abby.

24:46.917 --> 24:48.750
What did I do?

24:51.208 --> 24:52.166
You need
to put on sunblock, Conor.

24:52.250 --> 24:54.792
Leave me alone.

24:54.875 --> 24:57.625
Everything okay?

24:57.709 --> 24:59.125
Yeah, we're fine.

24:59.208 --> 25:02.208
You need to leave.

25:19.333 --> 25:21.208
Fuck him.

25:21.291 --> 25:24.166
I'll get plastic surgery.

25:24.250 --> 25:25.959
(lips smacking)

25:26.041 --> 25:29.250
I can look like a completely
different person for 30 thou.

25:29.333 --> 25:32.792
I passed a million places
in the last few days.

25:32.875 --> 25:35.417
I'll walk right in,
hand 'em cash.

25:35.500 --> 25:36.792
What about me?

25:36.875 --> 25:38.792
Leave me
the fuck alone.

25:38.875 --> 25:41.500
Call Ray,
and tell him I said...

25:41.583 --> 25:43.917
no deal.

25:46.834 --> 25:48.667
(dialing)

25:54.709 --> 25:57.041
(phone ringing)

26:01.250 --> 26:02.667
MICKEY:
It's your father.

26:02.750 --> 26:03.208
Don't hang up.

26:03.291 --> 26:05.959
What do you want?

26:06.041 --> 26:07.667
I'm beginning to see

26:07.750 --> 26:10.208
I caused a lot of trouble
since I got here.

26:10.291 --> 26:12.750
The scales are falling
from my eyes.

26:15.417 --> 26:18.291
The boys told me
what happened, Ray.

26:18.375 --> 26:21.291
I want to see you.
Give me ten minutes.

26:21.375 --> 26:23.500
Then I'll leave town,
be out of your life forever.

26:23.583 --> 26:24.458
You're lying.

26:24.542 --> 26:27.542
Ask Bunch. I moved out.

26:29.417 --> 26:32.000
The Fite Club. One hour.

26:38.959 --> 26:40.834
EZRA:
Raymond.

26:42.667 --> 26:44.834
Can I talk to you for a minute?
In private?

26:44.917 --> 26:47.375
Whatever you have to say,
Raymond, you can say it.

26:47.458 --> 26:51.041
I've asked Deb to marry me,
and she's accepted.

26:51.125 --> 26:52.583
Congratulations, Deb.

26:52.667 --> 26:54.875
A wife can't testify
against her husband.

26:56.875 --> 26:59.959
I, um... I think
I'll-I'll change the baby.

27:00.041 --> 27:02.000
Come on.

27:02.083 --> 27:04.875
Come on.

27:04.959 --> 27:07.875
Ooh, let's go.
Let's go.

27:07.959 --> 27:10.083
I think Ruth would
want me to be happy.

27:10.166 --> 27:12.041
You know, they met once.

27:12.125 --> 27:14.709
Ruth didn't know
that she was my mistress.

27:14.792 --> 27:16.458
I felt terrible.
Ruth liked her.

27:16.542 --> 27:18.166
Sully didn't take the bait.

27:19.959 --> 27:22.917
I'm gonna use our sources,
put out a bulletin.

27:23.000 --> 27:24.917
Say he was sighted
in Santa Monica.

27:25.000 --> 27:25.625
No, Raymond.

27:25.709 --> 27:27.125
Then anyone could turn him in.

27:27.208 --> 27:28.709
We can't risk it.

27:28.792 --> 27:31.792
Sully knows everything.
What's your plan, Ezra?

27:31.875 --> 27:33.834
I hire you to come up
with the plan.

27:33.917 --> 27:35.875
Then let me do my fucking job.

27:38.125 --> 27:38.750
(door slams)

27:44.792 --> 27:46.166
Hey, man.

27:46.250 --> 27:48.417
Did my dad send you?

27:48.500 --> 27:50.583
Yep.

27:50.667 --> 27:52.500
Where's Abby?

27:52.583 --> 27:53.208
Yeah, she had to
take Conor upstairs.

27:53.291 --> 27:56.041
How come?

27:56.125 --> 27:58.291
(sighs)
He got sick.

27:58.375 --> 27:59.250
Threw up in the hot tub.

27:59.333 --> 28:03.625
Oh, Jesus.

28:12.250 --> 28:14.208
(crying softly)
Hey, come on.

28:14.291 --> 28:14.792
(sniffling)

28:17.542 --> 28:20.166
(crying)

28:20.250 --> 28:20.917
Want to go for a walk?

28:23.875 --> 28:25.417
Yeah.

28:27.667 --> 28:29.208
BRIDGET:
I had this boyfriend,

28:29.291 --> 28:30.333
Marvin.

28:30.417 --> 28:33.625
He did one thing, and my
father almost killed him.

28:33.709 --> 28:34.959
What'd he do?

28:35.041 --> 28:36.959
He got a little
rough with me.

28:37.041 --> 28:39.000
He's from a different
culture, you know?

28:39.083 --> 28:39.458
He's more mature.

28:39.542 --> 28:41.375
He apologized.

28:41.458 --> 28:43.834
I believe you.

28:43.917 --> 28:45.542
My dad's a
fucking racist.

28:45.625 --> 28:47.709
No, he's a good guy; you just
have to give him a chance.

28:47.792 --> 28:50.959
He disappears all
the time; it's a joke.

28:51.041 --> 28:54.083
Now everybody's all fucked
up, and it's his fault.

28:54.166 --> 28:56.583
Well...

28:56.667 --> 29:00.041
when I first met him,

29:00.125 --> 29:02.458
he really
helped me out.

29:02.542 --> 29:03.875
How?

29:03.959 --> 29:05.792
I beat someone up.

29:05.875 --> 29:07.917
Got in a lot of trouble for it.

29:10.041 --> 29:11.500
I have anger issues.

29:11.583 --> 29:13.333
Really?

29:13.417 --> 29:15.166
Yeah.

29:15.250 --> 29:17.333
But your dad
was really good to me.

29:17.417 --> 29:18.166
He could see past that.

29:18.250 --> 29:21.083
He bailed me out
and gave me a job.

29:25.458 --> 29:28.000
Hey, listen...

29:28.083 --> 29:31.834
I know what a
bad father is.

29:31.917 --> 29:34.041
And you don't have one.

29:34.125 --> 29:35.125
So...

29:35.208 --> 29:38.917
stay open.

29:39.000 --> 29:41.709
And I think you'll
realize he's okay.

29:44.875 --> 29:47.166
All right?
Yeah.

33:10.709 --> 33:12.625
What do you want to say to me?

33:15.709 --> 33:18.041
I had this idea

33:18.125 --> 33:20.875
if I came out here,
it would all work out.

33:20.959 --> 33:22.333
Yeah?

No, it didn't.

Minute I got out.
First thing I did.

33:30.125 --> 33:32.709
I did it so we could
start fresh.

33:32.792 --> 33:34.291
We know how that turned out.

33:37.709 --> 33:40.208
Everybody makes mistakes, Ray.

33:40.291 --> 33:42.667
I'm gonna...

33:43.792 --> 33:46.250

Why'd you want
to have me killed?

33:57.834 --> 33:59.750
I can't stop thinking about it.

33:59.834 --> 34:02.792
It was like a stake in my heart.

34:02.875 --> 34:04.458
Why?

34:04.542 --> 34:06.166
(snickers)

34:06.250 --> 34:09.583
Are you fucking kidding me?

34:09.667 --> 34:12.041
Where do I even start?

34:12.125 --> 34:12.583
Terry?

34:12.667 --> 34:15.709
Bunch?

34:15.792 --> 34:18.500
Bridget killing herself? Huh?

34:18.583 --> 34:20.625
You're right about Terry.

34:20.709 --> 34:23.041
I should have stopped
that last fight.

34:23.125 --> 34:25.291
He took too many blows
to the head.

34:25.375 --> 34:26.625
I thought he could handle it,
but he couldn't.

34:26.709 --> 34:29.041
I got greedy.

34:29.125 --> 34:32.500
I really thought
he could fight his way out.

34:36.458 --> 34:38.792
I like black women, Ray.
What can I tell you?

34:38.875 --> 34:41.792
I can't apologize
for love, Ray.

34:41.875 --> 34:43.583
I loved her.

34:43.667 --> 34:45.291
You know they made death threats
against her and the baby?

34:45.375 --> 34:48.083
What kind of animals want to
kill a baby 'cause it's black?

34:48.166 --> 34:50.875

you made your life with.

34:50.959 --> 34:53.125
There were no fucking
death threats.
There were, Ray.

34:53.208 --> 34:55.000
You were whoring around
every fucking night!

34:55.083 --> 34:56.917
Selling coke, robbing banks.
Come on!

34:57.000 --> 34:59.375
I didn't know nothing else.

34:59.458 --> 35:00.834
I had no skills to speak of.

35:00.917 --> 35:02.041
Poor fucking Mick.

35:03.792 --> 35:06.333
I did 20 years for you.

35:06.417 --> 35:08.667
I took the rap for you
and Ezra and Sean.

35:08.750 --> 35:10.166
I kept my mouth shut.

35:10.250 --> 35:11.417
I did the time.

35:11.500 --> 35:13.083
You did 20 years

35:13.166 --> 35:14.041
because you stole half
a million dollars from Sully.

35:14.125 --> 35:16.959
The only place
you were safe was in prison.

35:17.041 --> 35:18.375
Where you ratted out
his whole family.

35:18.458 --> 35:20.458
I did the time for you, Ray.

35:20.542 --> 35:22.667
(scoffs)

35:22.750 --> 35:24.208
You loved us so much,

35:24.291 --> 35:26.333
how come you didn't
give us the money, huh?

35:26.417 --> 35:27.875
She needed it more.

35:28.000 --> 35:30.208
I knew you'd make it,
take care of the others.

35:30.291 --> 35:31.875
Bunchy and Terry, no way.

35:31.959 --> 35:32.667
They're weak.

35:32.750 --> 35:36.375
But you?

35:36.458 --> 35:39.291
You're my favorite, Ray.

35:39.375 --> 35:41.333
(voice breaking):
You always were.

35:41.417 --> 35:43.875
We're alike,
the two of us.

35:43.959 --> 35:46.375
Same exactly.

35:51.959 --> 35:54.083
(scoffs softly)

36:06.750 --> 36:09.917
I told you.

36:13.834 --> 36:17.458
I told you what happened
with that man.

36:17.542 --> 36:19.375
O'Connor.

36:24.166 --> 36:27.375
Remember what you did, Mick?

36:31.208 --> 36:32.291
Huh?

36:35.417 --> 36:38.792
You called me a liar,
and you beat the shit out of me.

36:38.875 --> 36:42.250
Remember that?

36:42.333 --> 36:44.750
You didn't stop him.

36:44.834 --> 36:48.333
And he kept after me
and kept after me.

36:52.583 --> 36:54.500
And then he went after Bunchy.

36:58.834 --> 37:00.959
Our sweet Bunchy.

37:02.875 --> 37:04.375
That's when I decided
to kill you, Mick.

37:08.291 --> 37:10.709
You been dead to me
since that day.

37:12.458 --> 37:16.250
You been dead to me
since I was ten years old.

37:20.208 --> 37:23.166
I'm sorry from the bottom
of my heart, Ray.

37:25.458 --> 37:26.834
(scoffs)

37:26.917 --> 37:27.959
There's no forgiveness for you,
you prick.

37:28.041 --> 37:30.500
Get the fuck out of here.

37:30.583 --> 37:32.500
(door opens)

37:42.625 --> 37:44.917
It's on. They called.

37:45.000 --> 37:47.750
Want to meet
at the marina.

37:47.834 --> 37:50.083
What's your plan, boy?

38:18.291 --> 38:19.583
Hey!

38:25.125 --> 38:27.041
That's a nice bike.

38:27.125 --> 38:29.208
Raleigh chopper.

38:29.291 --> 38:30.583
Yeah. Ape hangers.

38:34.041 --> 38:36.583
I didn't steal it.
