WEBVTT

00:06.774 --> 00:08.309
Previously on ER:

00:08.342 --> 00:09.510
I made a few decisions.

00:09.543 --> 00:10.578
Like what?

00:12.746 --> 00:16.250
I need you to
cosign a loan.

00:16.283 --> 00:18.286
Sneaking out of the house
like this

00:18.319 --> 00:19.620
feels a little

00:19.653 --> 00:21.222
unseemly.

00:21.255 --> 00:23.791
You say unseemly; I say sexy.

00:25.826 --> 00:27.461
Are you glad
to be home?

00:27.495 --> 00:29.263
Yes and no.

00:29.297 --> 00:31.365
I miss it.

00:31.399 --> 00:33.101
Well, you're part of something

00:33.134 --> 00:35.169
that's in constant motion
over there.

00:35.203 --> 00:39.140
Any break from it
you get is a luxury.

00:39.173 --> 00:40.508
( salsa music plays
from boom box )

00:40.541 --> 00:43.111
MAN:
If it drops below
20, dump it.

00:43.144 --> 00:44.545
All of it, yes.

00:44.578 --> 00:45.713
No, no, no,
no, no.

00:45.746 --> 00:47.648
No, no, no.
No, no, no.

00:47.681 --> 00:52.220
You bought this five
points ago, right?

00:52.253 --> 00:55.323
Now, it-it looks like a loser.

00:55.356 --> 00:57.325
Right, right.

00:57.358 --> 00:59.827
Last time I take a tip
from my contractor.

00:59.860 --> 01:01.129
Jeff, come on.

01:01.129 --> 01:02.396
I'm on the El.

01:02.430 --> 01:04.565
The car is gone.

01:04.598 --> 01:05.433
Just please...

01:05.465 --> 01:06.767
Just get rid of this,

01:06.800 --> 01:08.402
then we're done, all right,
and I'm out?

01:08.436 --> 01:09.337
MAN:
No more damn cartoons!

01:09.370 --> 01:10.571
WOMAN:
Por favor?

01:10.604 --> 01:11.772
Don't you know
what they're doing?

01:11.805 --> 01:12.673
Mis ninos estan mirandolo.

01:12.706 --> 01:14.408
Please stop hitting that.

01:14.442 --> 01:16.144
The poison that they're putting
in those little brains.

01:16.144 --> 01:17.445
Luka, I heard
you were back today.

01:17.478 --> 01:18.612
Relax, we've all
been here a while.

01:18.646 --> 01:19.713
Someone redecorated?

01:19.747 --> 01:21.249
Different furniture,
same patients.

01:21.282 --> 01:23.284
They send signals
through the animation.

01:23.317 --> 01:24.585
Call Weaver.
What are you,
an idiot?

01:24.618 --> 01:26.187
Nice to see you, too, Frank.

01:26.220 --> 01:28.156
Wonderful to have you back,
Dr. Kovac. Call Weaver.

01:28.156 --> 01:29.223
You're Dr. Kovac?

01:29.257 --> 01:31.625
Archie Morris,
one of the new R2s.

01:31.659 --> 01:33.594
Hey, Morris,
can you take this guy?

01:33.627 --> 01:34.695
Uh, sorry, lab run.

01:34.728 --> 01:36.330
We need to see him now.

01:36.364 --> 01:38.166
The ducklings could use
some guidance.

01:38.199 --> 01:39.433
We've been short on attendings.

01:39.467 --> 01:40.768
Where did they
put the lounge?

01:40.801 --> 01:41.835
Down there, but you really
should really check in

01:41.869 --> 01:43.171
with Weaver first.

01:43.171 --> 01:44.272
What are you,
an idiot?

01:44.305 --> 01:45.306
They use
the coyote

01:45.339 --> 01:46.340
as a messenger of evil.

01:46.374 --> 01:48.176
Relax, Mr. Yurman.
ACME

01:48.176 --> 01:49.277
is a Cyrillic
acronym.

01:49.310 --> 01:50.611
They send signals.

01:50.644 --> 01:53.347
All Hallow's Eve,
and the loonies are loose.

01:53.381 --> 01:55.816
WOMAN:
Please, somebody
help me, please.

01:55.849 --> 01:57.818
I need help.

01:57.851 --> 02:01.789
Oh, God, he fell out
of the shopping cart.

02:01.822 --> 02:03.424
I must not have
strapped him in right.

02:03.457 --> 02:05.193
Did he hit his head?

02:05.226 --> 02:06.894
I'm not... I'm not sure.

02:06.927 --> 02:08.829
I saw it.
He hit his head.

02:08.862 --> 02:09.863
Did he cry?

02:09.896 --> 02:12.700
No. He was just quiet.

02:12.733 --> 02:13.734
What does that mean?

02:13.767 --> 02:15.369
I.O. kit and a pedes bag mask.

02:15.403 --> 02:17.938
What should I tell Weaver?

02:17.971 --> 02:19.273
I'm looking for
the charge nurse.

02:19.307 --> 02:20.341
Charge nurse?

02:20.374 --> 02:21.742
We have a charge nurse?

02:21.775 --> 02:24.612
Uh, "Abigail Lockhart"?

02:24.645 --> 02:25.446
I think she's off today.

02:25.479 --> 02:28.516
Come back tomorrow.

02:28.549 --> 02:29.717
( loud thudding )

02:29.750 --> 02:31.252
( glass shattering )

02:31.285 --> 02:32.220
Aah! He was going nuts,
so we locked him inside.

02:32.253 --> 02:33.387
Where's the vent?

02:33.421 --> 02:34.455
I'm going to pepper-spray him.

02:34.488 --> 02:35.823
Wait a minute. What happens

02:35.856 --> 02:37.258
when that stuff gets
all over the place?

02:37.291 --> 02:38.326
He's throwing
dirty sharps,
Pratt.

02:38.359 --> 02:39.693
Let them do
their thing.

02:39.727 --> 02:40.661
We've got patients
with allergies...

02:40.694 --> 02:42.230
You got a better idea?

02:42.230 --> 02:45.499
Chuny, five of Haldol.
Go. Come on, baby.

02:45.533 --> 02:46.567
What are you doing?

02:46.600 --> 02:48.502
We're going in. Hold onto this.

02:48.536 --> 02:50.804
( glass shattering )

02:50.838 --> 02:52.773
All right, you--
you do the honors.

02:52.806 --> 02:54.275
When you see the opening,
go for his thigh.

02:54.308 --> 02:54.975
We're going in now.

02:55.008 --> 02:57.445
Let's go.

02:57.478 --> 02:59.613
( groaning )

02:59.647 --> 03:01.282
Get off me, Taliban pigs!

03:01.315 --> 03:02.516
Morris, what are you doing?

03:02.550 --> 03:03.984
Get in here! Now!

03:04.017 --> 03:06.554
I have a nuclear device
in my ass,

03:06.587 --> 03:07.821
and I'm not
afraid to use it.

03:07.855 --> 03:09.590
COOP:
Morris, make
it happen!

03:09.623 --> 03:10.824
Get off me!

03:10.858 --> 03:11.559
Hold his head.

03:11.592 --> 03:12.593
Who are you?

03:14.695 --> 03:16.930
Whoa, whoa,
the thigh, the thigh!

03:16.964 --> 03:19.867
( groaning )

03:19.900 --> 03:21.302
PRATT:
Yeah, nice
and slow.

03:21.335 --> 03:22.970
Yeah.
Got it.

03:26.807 --> 03:28.342
Oh, please tell me
you work here.

03:30.611 --> 03:32.580
Sam Taggart-- new nurse.

03:34.000 --> 03:40.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:24.798 --> 04:28.402
How much longer, little girl?

04:28.436 --> 04:29.870
I'm sorry, ma'am,

04:29.903 --> 04:32.373
but you're still
about 20 down on the list.

04:32.406 --> 04:33.874
20 minutes?

04:33.907 --> 04:35.943
I'll see what I can do.

04:35.976 --> 04:38.546
So, what's today's
excuse for Triage
being a stinking,

04:38.579 --> 04:39.580
overpopulated
cesspool of humanity?

04:39.613 --> 04:40.814
The healthcare system?

04:40.848 --> 04:42.516
Yeah, well,
if things gets too backed up,

04:42.550 --> 04:44.518
you can try stabbing some
of these deadbeats in the neck.

04:44.552 --> 04:46.354
That ought to have them running
to Northwestern.

04:46.387 --> 04:47.821
Hey, can you check out
this lady?

04:47.855 --> 04:49.490
Shallow forehead lac
from a fall, doesn't look

04:49.523 --> 04:50.358
like she'll need stitches.

04:50.358 --> 04:51.559
She's hungover.

04:51.592 --> 04:52.926
If you just do a quick exam
and clear her,

04:52.960 --> 04:54.027
I'll take care
of the steri-strips.

04:54.061 --> 04:55.396
Dr. Kovac needs me in Trauma.

04:55.429 --> 04:56.730
Frank, which attendings

04:56.764 --> 04:58.432
should I be focusing
my rage on today?

04:58.466 --> 04:59.667
I just came on.

04:59.700 --> 05:01.635
Kovac is in One--
baby with a head trauma.

05:01.669 --> 05:03.937
Colonel Kurtz?
I thought he was dead.

05:03.971 --> 05:05.573
Hey, look at that.
Nice hand.

05:05.606 --> 05:07.575
Yeah. You want
to see it in action?

05:07.608 --> 05:09.410
You'd have to buy
me a drink first.

05:09.443 --> 05:10.911
Good breath sounds, sats 94.

05:10.944 --> 05:12.746
BP's up to 130/85.

05:12.780 --> 05:14.748
Okay, get a collar
on him and, uh...

05:14.782 --> 05:15.849
Your name again?

05:15.883 --> 05:17.385
Neela.

05:17.385 --> 05:18.486
Neela, tell me why
is he hypertensive.

05:18.519 --> 05:19.853
Intracranial hemorrhage?

05:19.887 --> 05:21.121
Another Mig of Ativan.
It's okay, sweetie.

05:21.154 --> 05:22.656
Mama's here.
( phone ringing )

05:22.690 --> 05:24.458
Heard you had a head trauma.
You need a hand?

05:24.492 --> 05:25.859
Load him with 20 per
kilo of phenobarb.

05:25.893 --> 05:26.960
Yeah, you can
answer the phone.

05:26.994 --> 05:28.496
Heart rate's down to 120.

05:28.529 --> 05:30.864
Tone's decreased.

05:30.898 --> 05:31.799
Hello?

05:31.832 --> 05:32.700
NEELA:
No hemotympanum.

05:32.733 --> 05:33.667
What does that tell you?

05:33.701 --> 05:35.135
No basilar skull fracture.

05:35.168 --> 05:37.037
Is everything in his brain okay?

05:37.070 --> 05:37.938
Dr. Weaver
holding for you.

05:37.971 --> 05:39.072
One thing at a time.

05:39.106 --> 05:40.808
We'll get a
CT and wait

05:40.841 --> 05:42.576
till he wakes up.

05:42.610 --> 05:43.944
I'll take it in the hall,
Morris.

05:43.977 --> 05:46.079
Wait here till I get back.

05:46.113 --> 05:46.947
Is it all right
if I draw the blood?

05:46.980 --> 05:48.682
Uh, kids are tough.

05:48.716 --> 05:49.883
It's not a good
student case.

05:49.917 --> 05:52.420
You're students?

05:52.420 --> 05:53.521
She is. I'm a doctor.

05:53.554 --> 05:56.156
Resps are
still shallow.

05:56.189 --> 05:57.858
Biceps contraction flexes
the elbow.

05:57.891 --> 05:59.627
Momentary pause locks the elbow,

05:59.660 --> 06:00.928
activating
the terminal device.

06:00.961 --> 06:01.995
Biceps opens the hand.

06:02.029 --> 06:03.431
Triceps closes the hand.

06:03.431 --> 06:05.032
Hey, check out Robo-doc.

06:05.065 --> 06:05.899
How do you have time
to loiter around

06:05.933 --> 06:07.635
making moronic comments

06:07.668 --> 06:09.637
when your loser in Two is
still waiting to be dispo'd?

06:09.670 --> 06:10.938
I'm good at
prioritizing.
Uh-huh.

06:10.971 --> 06:12.673
Rule-out small
bowel obstruction,

06:12.706 --> 06:14.442
still waiting on
a surgical consult.

06:14.442 --> 06:16.076
Oh, well, I didn't see
him with an NG tube.

06:16.109 --> 06:17.611
'Cause I didn't drop an NG tube.

06:17.645 --> 06:19.046
Well, gee, you think
surgery might expect you to?

06:19.079 --> 06:20.047
Let's see what they say.

06:20.080 --> 06:21.615
No, let's do it and see

06:21.649 --> 06:23.484
if you can get through
a single damn shift

06:23.517 --> 06:25.018
without pissing off one of the
other departments, all right?

06:25.052 --> 06:26.620
You should grease that thing.

06:26.654 --> 06:27.621
You're starting to
get a little squeaky.

06:27.655 --> 06:29.757
Get out of here.
Where was I?

06:29.790 --> 06:32.460
Oh, yeah. Okay, co-contraction
releases the elbow.

06:32.460 --> 06:34.462
Biceps flexes the elbow.

06:38.932 --> 06:40.100
I wouldn't use that
to do a rectal.

06:40.133 --> 06:41.635
( stifling
chuckle )

06:41.669 --> 06:42.570
MARQUEZ:
Sats are dropping.

06:42.603 --> 06:43.571
Down to 86...

06:43.604 --> 06:44.772
Is he moving air?
85...

06:44.805 --> 06:45.673
84.
What's happening?

06:45.706 --> 06:46.940
83.
He's apneic.

06:46.974 --> 06:48.576
He's having
trouble breathing.

06:48.609 --> 06:50.878
Get me... get me a 4-0 ET tube
and a miller one blade.

06:50.911 --> 06:51.812
You're going to intubate?

06:51.845 --> 06:52.646
What are you doing?

06:52.680 --> 06:53.747
We're putting a tube

06:53.781 --> 06:54.815
in his airway
to help him breathe.

06:54.848 --> 06:56.484
( alarms beeping )

06:56.484 --> 06:57.985
I can't see anything.
I need more suction.

06:58.018 --> 06:59.052
Heart rate's above 100.

06:59.086 --> 07:00.621
Maybe we should
get Dr. Kovac?

07:00.654 --> 07:02.155
I'm sorry, Kerry,
I tried to tell the kid

07:02.189 --> 07:03.991
that his seizing
was inconvenient for you.

07:04.024 --> 07:06.560
Luka! Luka,
that R2 is intubating.

07:06.594 --> 07:08.696
I'll call you back.

07:10.731 --> 07:11.732
NEELA:
Sats are down to 75.

07:11.765 --> 07:12.900
Okay, stop.

07:12.933 --> 07:14.001
I think I'm almost there.

07:14.034 --> 07:15.503
Pulse is
dropping to 86.

07:15.536 --> 07:19.573
Stop! He's starting
to brady down.

07:19.607 --> 07:21.008
The apnea's
probably transient.

07:21.041 --> 07:22.142
Just bag him
through it.

07:22.175 --> 07:23.110
Everything okay?

07:23.143 --> 07:24.044
It's okay now.

07:24.077 --> 07:26.880
Sats coming up-- 83, 84...

07:26.914 --> 07:27.881
Why don't you step outside

07:27.915 --> 07:28.916
for a little while?

07:28.949 --> 07:30.718
No. I'm not
leaving him.

07:30.751 --> 07:31.985
Why don't we go sit out
in the hallway?

07:32.019 --> 07:33.754
That way, I can get
more information

07:33.787 --> 07:35.055
from you, and I think

07:35.088 --> 07:37.558
your son might be
a little more comfortable.

07:39.960 --> 07:42.730
( breathing heavily )

07:48.602 --> 07:49.937
KOVAC:
With a sedated
baby, you need

07:49.970 --> 07:51.104
to try bagging him first.

07:51.138 --> 07:52.005
I thought his
airway was...

07:52.039 --> 07:54.174
I know what you thought.

07:55.676 --> 07:56.243
We were late.

07:56.276 --> 07:58.579
We were in a hurry.

07:58.612 --> 08:01.014
Henry's school had
a Halloween barbecue, and...

08:03.050 --> 08:05.586
I should have strapped him
in better.

08:05.619 --> 08:08.556
We forgot
to pick up the hot dogs.

08:09.957 --> 08:11.559
Why don't you go
get your mom a soda?

08:11.592 --> 08:13.260
The machine's right
around the corner.

08:13.293 --> 08:15.729
She doesn't drink soda.

08:15.763 --> 08:17.665
How about some
bottled water?

08:22.069 --> 08:24.071
Mrs. Martin, are you okay?

08:24.104 --> 08:26.039
( sighs )

08:26.073 --> 08:27.207
Uh...

08:27.240 --> 08:29.610
( laughs )

08:29.643 --> 08:31.311
Um...

08:31.344 --> 08:35.282
my therapist prescribed me,
um, Zoloft.

08:35.315 --> 08:37.083
Maybe I'm...

08:37.116 --> 08:39.620
Maybe I'm not
reacting well to it.

08:39.653 --> 08:41.621
Zoloft?

08:41.655 --> 08:44.057
I've been... a little down.

08:44.091 --> 08:46.827
My husband and I
are getting divorced.

08:48.261 --> 08:50.664
He's trying
to take the kids away.

08:50.698 --> 08:52.833
That must be hard.

08:55.002 --> 08:56.003
Yeah.

08:56.036 --> 08:57.638
We were together for 12 years,

08:57.671 --> 09:00.874
and suddenly one day,
he wakes up hating me.

09:00.908 --> 09:02.776
I don't know what happened.

09:04.845 --> 09:07.948
I'm sorry I have to ask this,
but have you been drinking?

09:07.981 --> 09:10.618
No.

09:10.651 --> 09:12.853
I can smell it on your breath.

09:12.886 --> 09:15.055
I'm just trying
to help you, Paula.

09:15.088 --> 09:17.758
71-year-old male,
vomiting for five hours.

09:17.791 --> 09:20.160
Tachy at 114, BP: 116/72.

09:20.193 --> 09:21.795
Put him in curtain one.

09:21.829 --> 09:23.230
I'll be there in a minute.

09:23.263 --> 09:25.232
I wasn't drunk.

09:25.265 --> 09:26.900
I really wasn't.

09:26.934 --> 09:29.202
Would you take
a blood alcohol test?

09:29.236 --> 09:30.370
( sighs )

09:30.403 --> 09:32.673
Can you make me do that?

09:32.706 --> 09:35.008
That's not the best answer.

09:35.042 --> 09:37.645
No. Uh...

09:37.645 --> 09:40.080
Uh...

09:40.113 --> 09:42.850
I made a mistake.

09:43.917 --> 09:46.153
Okay. I'll, uh, be back

09:46.186 --> 09:48.188
when I hear anything about Adam.

09:48.221 --> 09:49.356
Okay, okay.

09:49.389 --> 09:51.792
Here, Mom, drink this.

09:57.097 --> 09:58.799
Look, stop handling me.

09:58.832 --> 10:00.200
I-I can do it by myself.

10:00.233 --> 10:02.069
Ben Hollander.
Neighbors called 911

10:02.102 --> 10:03.737
when he didn't
answer the door.

10:03.771 --> 10:06.006
Resps are 18,
100% on room air.

10:06.039 --> 10:07.775
Hi. I'm Dr. Lewis.

10:07.808 --> 10:10.911
Have you had any fever,
loss of appetite, dizziness?

10:10.944 --> 10:13.914
I mean, all-all this
over a-a bad plate of shrimp?

10:13.947 --> 10:15.182
Chuny, Pratt asked
if you'd check again

10:15.215 --> 10:16.149
on his surgery consult?

10:16.183 --> 10:16.950
Can't someone else do it?

10:16.984 --> 10:18.786
Abby's off.

10:18.819 --> 10:21.955
The new girl's on Triage,
and no one else speaks English.

10:21.989 --> 10:24.725
Okay. All right,
you can sit up now.

10:24.758 --> 10:26.226
How's the baby?

10:26.259 --> 10:28.395
He went to CT.

10:28.428 --> 10:29.062
( grunts softly )

10:29.096 --> 10:30.798
Whoa, oh.

10:30.831 --> 10:32.132
Have you had any dizziness?

10:32.165 --> 10:35.836
No, no. I just...
I just got up too fast.

10:35.869 --> 10:38.238
The ST segments
look odd.

10:38.271 --> 10:39.940
( sighs )

10:39.973 --> 10:42.042
PVCs and scooped STs.

10:42.075 --> 10:43.844
Didge toxicity?

10:43.877 --> 10:45.112
Are you on any medications?

10:45.145 --> 10:47.447
Uh, something
for cholesterol,

10:47.480 --> 10:49.683
a few others for

10:49.717 --> 10:52.319
blood pressure, um,

10:52.352 --> 10:54.755
gout, water pills,

10:54.788 --> 10:57.858
and, uh, I dissolve a pill
under my tongue

10:57.891 --> 11:00.961
for-for an allergy.

11:00.994 --> 11:02.896
Digoxin?

11:02.930 --> 11:06.099
NEELA:
It's a heart medicine.

11:06.133 --> 11:09.036
Sounds, uh, sounds familiar.

11:09.069 --> 11:11.905
Okay, we're going
to give you some fluids now.

11:11.939 --> 11:12.940
Oh, Glenlivet,
I hope.

11:12.973 --> 11:14.207
More like Gatorade.

11:14.241 --> 11:16.744
And we'll need an EKG
and a blood test.

11:16.744 --> 11:18.145
Look, is-is all
that necessary?

11:18.178 --> 11:19.747
Just humor me.

11:19.780 --> 11:21.381
Keep him on a monitor
and get a didge level.

11:21.414 --> 11:24.051
I-I'd rather go home.

11:24.084 --> 11:26.754
Not until we know you're better.

11:26.787 --> 11:28.822
( sighs )

11:28.856 --> 11:30.090
What do you have, Gallant?

11:30.123 --> 11:31.358
Uh, Mr. Hernandez
twisted his knee.

11:31.391 --> 11:32.960
We're waiting
on X-ray.

11:32.993 --> 11:34.261
It's possible MCL,
so I want to be sure

11:34.294 --> 11:35.929
there's not
an avulsion fracture.

11:35.963 --> 11:37.164
What kind of work do you do?

11:37.197 --> 11:38.165
I'm a carpet
installer.

11:38.198 --> 11:39.332
Do you like it?

11:39.366 --> 11:41.068
Makes you appreciate
standing up.

11:41.101 --> 11:42.469
It's anserine bursitis.

11:42.502 --> 11:44.471
Cancel the X-ray and put him
on Indocin for a week.

11:44.504 --> 11:45.906
How did you diagnose that?

11:45.939 --> 11:47.340
Focused history
and physical.

11:47.374 --> 11:48.776
No x-rays in
the Congo.

11:48.776 --> 11:50.110
I smelled alcohol

11:50.143 --> 11:51.945
on Paula Martin's breath--
the baby's mom?

11:51.979 --> 11:53.446
She didn't seem drunk
to me, just upset.

11:53.480 --> 11:55.048
I think
we should call Social Work.

11:55.082 --> 11:56.917
The baby needs
to be admitted overnight.

11:56.950 --> 11:59.419
Let the floor team deal with it.
We've got patients stacked up.

11:59.452 --> 12:00.487
If the floor team
deals with it,

12:00.520 --> 12:02.155
it falls through
the cracks.

12:02.189 --> 12:04.257
So what? We turn this
into a bureaucratic mess?

12:04.291 --> 12:05.859
No. I don't want the kids

12:05.893 --> 12:07.227
to come back tomorrow
with something worse.

12:07.260 --> 12:08.395
Fine. Make the call.

12:08.428 --> 12:10.397
Gallant, will you
help me in Exam Two?

12:10.430 --> 12:11.799
A skater boy.

12:11.799 --> 12:13.200
Neela, give me the history.

12:13.233 --> 12:14.401
Epigastric pain,

12:14.434 --> 12:15.836
improved with a GI cocktail.

12:15.869 --> 12:17.004
Chem 20's pending.

12:17.037 --> 12:18.338
She speaks English pretty good.

12:18.371 --> 12:19.907
Better than you,
in fact.

12:19.940 --> 12:22.309
So, what did you
hope to find out
from the labs?

12:22.342 --> 12:25.078
He was in pain. I was worried
about pancreatitis.

12:25.112 --> 12:26.413
But he improved
with the antacids.

12:26.446 --> 12:29.016
Hey, is that Pratt
in there with Lewis?

12:29.049 --> 12:30.851
NEELA:
No, it's Gallant.

12:30.884 --> 12:32.552
Oh. I always get those two
mixed up.

12:32.585 --> 12:33.821
Must be the goatee.

12:33.821 --> 12:35.322
Send him home on
an H2 blocker.

12:35.355 --> 12:37.090
I thought we weren't supposed
to discharge them

12:37.124 --> 12:38.191
until the labs are back.

12:38.225 --> 12:39.459
Yeah, that's why Triage looks

12:39.492 --> 12:40.393
like a refugee camp.

12:40.427 --> 12:41.929
Ha.

12:41.962 --> 12:43.496
Get his phone number
and call him back in

12:43.530 --> 12:44.932
if his labs are abnormal.

12:44.965 --> 12:46.333
But trust me, they won't be.

12:46.366 --> 12:47.300
We ought to send
the whole staff

12:47.334 --> 12:48.836
to the dark continent.

12:48.836 --> 12:49.536
Frank, where the hell is
my surgical consult?

12:49.569 --> 12:50.938
Your surgical consult?

12:50.971 --> 12:52.405
Exactly my
question, doctor,

12:52.439 --> 12:54.842
and I use that
term loosely.
Follow me.

12:54.875 --> 12:56.844
Your upright abdomen shows
a few air-fluid levels.

12:56.877 --> 12:58.245
So, in all likelihood,

12:58.278 --> 12:59.947
this infamous patient
of yours has an ileus,

12:59.980 --> 13:00.848
not a bowel obstruction,
leading you to?

13:00.848 --> 13:01.548
Admit to medicine.

13:01.581 --> 13:02.883
Bingo! Do
not pass go,

13:02.916 --> 13:04.284
do not occupy
another bed

13:04.317 --> 13:05.919
and do not continue
waiting for Dr. Godot

13:05.953 --> 13:06.887
to come down from surgery
and offer the same diagnosis

13:06.920 --> 13:08.455
that I am offering for...

13:08.488 --> 13:10.157
Except that
I'm not comfortable dispo'ing

13:10.190 --> 13:12.059
until he is cleared
by a surgeon.

13:12.092 --> 13:13.193
Fine, allow me.
No. Someone who still
has privileges.

13:13.226 --> 13:14.594
Hi.

13:14.627 --> 13:16.229
Hi. Nice costume.
You're a day early.

13:16.263 --> 13:18.198
I'll tell you what
privilege I do have--

13:18.231 --> 13:20.367
the privilege to
make your life the
tenth circle of hell.

13:20.400 --> 13:21.468
You need an assessment

13:21.501 --> 13:23.336
on a possible
bowel obstruction?

13:23.370 --> 13:24.571
Pardon me?

13:24.604 --> 13:26.106
I started
my surgical
rotation today.

13:26.139 --> 13:27.274
I'm back in
med school.

13:27.307 --> 13:28.441
Really?

13:28.475 --> 13:29.609
Lovely.

13:29.642 --> 13:30.978
Congratulations.

13:31.011 --> 13:33.246
Could you breathe for me, sir?

13:33.280 --> 13:37.284
You waited 3h hours
for Abby?

13:40.921 --> 13:42.155
Well, I never meant
to quit med school forever,

13:42.189 --> 13:43.123
and it seemed like
the right time to go back.

13:43.156 --> 13:44.224
I only have
one year left.

13:44.257 --> 13:45.492
Where'd you
get the money?

13:45.525 --> 13:48.495
Begged, borrowed,
threatened my ex-husband.

13:48.528 --> 13:49.596
Good for you.

13:49.629 --> 13:50.898
As soon as I paid up,

13:50.931 --> 13:52.365
they put me right back
on rotation.

13:52.399 --> 13:53.967
And Corday sent you
down for a consult?

13:54.001 --> 13:55.268
Well, she was jammed.

13:55.302 --> 13:56.503
She figured I could handle
a bowel obstruction.

13:56.536 --> 13:58.271
So, no more nursing?

13:58.305 --> 14:01.174
No. I'm still going to be
taking a few shifts for a while.

14:01.208 --> 14:02.275
I need the money.

14:02.309 --> 14:03.510
Wow, you must
feel great.

14:03.543 --> 14:04.444
I do.
And tired.

14:04.477 --> 14:05.913
I was up till 3:00

14:05.913 --> 14:07.915
studying the branches
of the facial nerve.

14:07.915 --> 14:09.316
We have a parotid
resection later.

14:09.349 --> 14:10.417
Oh, yeah.

14:10.450 --> 14:12.552
Ten zebras bit
my cockatoo.

14:12.585 --> 14:14.521
It's a mnemonic:
T-Z-B-M-C.

14:14.554 --> 14:16.556
Mnemonics got me
through med school.

14:16.589 --> 14:18.058
Are you from the OR?

14:18.091 --> 14:20.493
No, I'm not,
but she is.

14:20.527 --> 14:22.930
Crush victim-- looks like
an intra-abdominal bleed.

14:22.963 --> 14:24.497
OLBES:
Hypotensive, 92/60.

14:24.531 --> 14:26.066
Pulse 115
after two liters.

14:26.099 --> 14:27.534
KOVAC:
Open an adult
intubation kit.

14:27.567 --> 14:28.936
Any LOC?

14:28.936 --> 14:29.937
Denied--
normal mentation

14:29.970 --> 14:31.104
and vitals
on scene.

14:31.138 --> 14:32.539
You're the consultant?
Yep.

14:32.572 --> 14:33.506
Coat looks good on you.

14:33.540 --> 14:34.942
Primary survey complete?

14:34.975 --> 14:36.343
I'm fast, but
not that fast.

14:36.376 --> 14:37.577
ROMANO:
Then get faster.

14:37.610 --> 14:38.611
Sats are dropping.
Sats are dropping.

14:38.645 --> 14:40.013
Sorry.

14:40.047 --> 14:41.481
Oh, goody.
"Surgery's" here.

14:41.514 --> 14:42.950
BP: 64,
systolic.

14:42.983 --> 14:44.084
Both lungs are up

14:44.117 --> 14:45.352
and clear;
heart tones good.

14:45.385 --> 14:46.486
Trachea midline,
no JVD.

14:46.519 --> 14:48.021
SAM:
Infuser's primed.

14:48.055 --> 14:50.991
ABBY:
Belly is distended,
tender and tense.

14:51.024 --> 14:53.426
So, surgical candidate or piece
of meat, Miss Lockhart?

14:53.460 --> 14:55.628
Pulse 120.

14:55.662 --> 14:57.464
I'm going to consult
my attending.

14:57.497 --> 15:01.134
Well, this should be the Butcher
of Birmingham herself.

15:01.168 --> 15:02.069
Dr. Corday?

15:02.102 --> 15:03.971
I have a crush victim,

15:03.971 --> 15:05.338
hypotensive with
an ecchymotic belly
and a deep lac.

15:05.372 --> 15:06.473
You might want to come...

15:06.506 --> 15:08.408
Yeah, thank you.
That's enough.

15:08.441 --> 15:09.642
Lizzie, she'll be right up

15:09.676 --> 15:11.311
with an intubated
surgical patient

15:11.344 --> 15:12.579
and her tail
between her legs.

15:12.612 --> 15:14.214
Any idiot can see
that this patient

15:14.247 --> 15:15.515
is on his way to the OR.

15:15.548 --> 15:16.984
He needs a Foley
and an NG tube,
chop-chop.

15:16.984 --> 15:18.118
Now, where can
you find a nurse

15:18.151 --> 15:19.119
when you really need one?

15:19.152 --> 15:21.388
Hmm. Oh, hey, how about you?

15:21.421 --> 15:22.655
Excuse me?

15:22.689 --> 15:24.091
That's okay.
I'll get the Foley.

15:24.124 --> 15:25.558
Miss Haldol,
there's nothing

15:25.592 --> 15:27.394
I find sexier than a mute girl
covered in blood,

15:27.427 --> 15:30.230
so keep your head down
and your mouth shut.

15:30.263 --> 15:31.631
You sound just
like a guy

15:31.664 --> 15:33.266
I used to date--
he's dead.

15:33.300 --> 15:35.402
No gag.
Time to go tubular.

15:35.435 --> 15:37.004
Okay, why don't you let me
take Abby through this?

15:37.004 --> 15:38.405
Why don't you
tube this guy

15:38.438 --> 15:40.640
and leave the mentoring
to me, okay, Tarzan?

15:40.673 --> 15:43.276
Okay, let me the end tidal
C02 detector.

15:43.310 --> 15:44.677
Either fetch
me some urine,

15:44.711 --> 15:47.680
or don't let the door
hit you on the ass.

15:47.714 --> 15:51.151
KOVAC:
Okay, big tongue,
big cords.

15:51.184 --> 15:52.285
SAM:
You're in.

15:52.319 --> 15:54.654
COOP:
Bag him up.

15:54.687 --> 15:56.756
HENRY:
It's okay, Adam.

15:56.789 --> 16:00.093
You're just tired now.

16:00.127 --> 16:02.162
Don't wake him up,
okay, sweetie?

16:05.132 --> 16:05.732
How was the CT?

16:05.765 --> 16:08.268
Is his brain okay?

16:08.301 --> 16:09.736
There are
some good signs,

16:09.769 --> 16:13.306
but we're going to have
to wait to be sure.

16:13.340 --> 16:14.341
Paula, Social Work's

16:14.374 --> 16:15.575
coming down
to talk to you.

16:15.608 --> 16:16.743
You called them?

16:16.776 --> 16:18.745
I am concerned
about your drinking.

16:18.778 --> 16:19.746
( sighs )

16:19.779 --> 16:21.414
I told you...

16:21.448 --> 16:23.450
You said you've been
under a lot of stress.

16:23.483 --> 16:25.118
I don't need to talk
to a social worker.

16:25.152 --> 16:26.253
It doesn't help.

16:26.286 --> 16:28.088
There've been prior incidents?

16:28.121 --> 16:32.292
Are you
in the CPS database?

16:32.325 --> 16:34.161
It was nothing.

16:36.096 --> 16:38.465
Let's go, Kovac.
We're not on Zulu time here.

16:38.498 --> 16:39.599
Pressure's holding,
104 systolic.

16:39.632 --> 16:40.767
How far up
the tube?

16:40.800 --> 16:41.468
Until you run
out of suture.

16:41.501 --> 16:42.669
Almost done.

16:42.702 --> 16:44.704
No, done. Tape it.
Now, let's go.

16:44.737 --> 16:47.307
Dr. Romano, Dr. Anspaugh
is waiting upstairs for you.

16:47.340 --> 16:48.475
He needs surgery now,

16:48.508 --> 16:51.444
not when she learns how
to tie a knot.

16:51.478 --> 16:53.480
That is some poisonous,
one-armed midget

16:53.513 --> 16:54.347
you got running
this place.

16:54.381 --> 16:55.582
Damn it.

16:55.615 --> 16:57.484
Luka, Weaver's
looking for you.

16:57.517 --> 16:58.485
I'll call her back.

16:58.518 --> 16:59.452
She's in the hall.

16:59.486 --> 17:02.189
( Kovac sighs )

17:02.222 --> 17:04.590
You're fine here, right?

17:04.624 --> 17:06.393
You're fine.

17:06.425 --> 17:08.595
I need some xeroform.

17:08.627 --> 17:10.097
She'll also need
some elastoplast.

17:10.097 --> 17:12.132
Yeah, I'm on it.

17:12.165 --> 17:13.633
You're Samantha?

17:13.665 --> 17:15.135
Sam.

17:15.167 --> 17:16.469
Neela. If you need any help...

17:16.502 --> 17:18.171
Thanks,
but more likely than not,

17:18.204 --> 17:20.107
it'll be the other way around.

17:20.107 --> 17:21.340
WEAVER:
If you're going to come back,

17:21.374 --> 17:22.575
we need to set
some guidelines.

17:22.608 --> 17:23.810
Gallant, roadburn
in Two is gone?

17:23.843 --> 17:25.345
He skated out of
here an hour ago.

17:25.377 --> 17:27.214
We need a guarantee
of 36 hours a week.

17:27.247 --> 17:29.682
Dr. Kovac, this lady's
been waiting a while.

17:29.716 --> 17:32.285
My name's Athena,
like the goddess.

17:32.319 --> 17:34.254
I-I'm getting to her.

17:34.287 --> 17:35.588
KOVAC:
How about 72?

17:35.622 --> 17:37.224
72 hours?

17:37.257 --> 17:38.658
Rule out apply
in curtain Four?

17:38.691 --> 17:39.759
MORRIS:
Still waiting on CT.

17:39.792 --> 17:41.594
Since 9:00 a.m.?

17:41.628 --> 17:43.363
I'll do six 12s a week,
every week.

17:43.396 --> 17:45.298
Are you trying to buy yourself
another burnout?

17:45.332 --> 17:47.300
Hey, in Africa, I did
18 hours a day every day.

17:47.334 --> 17:48.568
This is a piece of pie.

17:48.601 --> 17:50.437
"Cake."

17:50.470 --> 17:52.705
Let's pretend CT was down.
What do you do then?

17:52.739 --> 17:54.141
Uh, send him to
another hospital?

17:54.141 --> 17:55.375
No, it'll be
too much.

17:55.408 --> 17:56.843
I want to work.
I need the money.

17:56.876 --> 17:58.678
Does he have
rebound tenderness?

17:58.711 --> 18:00.347
Obturator and psoas signs?

18:00.380 --> 18:02.382
I'll also require
four weeks' notice

18:02.415 --> 18:04.184
next time you decide
to skip town.

18:04.217 --> 18:05.818
Hey, give me the shifts,
and I'll do even better.

18:05.852 --> 18:07.487
I'll give you eight.

18:07.520 --> 18:09.222
Because two months from
now, I'll be gone again.

18:09.256 --> 18:10.623
Two months?

18:10.657 --> 18:12.192
I'm going back.
( taps glass )

18:12.225 --> 18:13.826
Before you order
a $3,000 test,

18:13.860 --> 18:15.228
you should do a
thorough exam.

18:15.262 --> 18:16.163
To Africa?

18:16.163 --> 18:17.597
For how long?

18:17.630 --> 18:19.166
I don't know. I'll
see when I get there.

18:19.199 --> 18:20.700
Uh, can you sign
off on these?

18:20.733 --> 18:23.370
Acute CVA,
esophageal impaction.

18:23.403 --> 18:25.305
Fine, but I'll need it
in writing.

18:25.338 --> 18:26.439
Yeah, draw up
a contract.

18:26.473 --> 18:27.674
Dislocated thumb,
urticaria.

18:27.707 --> 18:28.841
And from now on,

18:28.875 --> 18:30.577
you'll be answering
to Dr. Romano.

18:30.610 --> 18:32.912
Oh, then we should definitely
talk about a raise.

18:32.945 --> 18:34.547
MAN:
Two months ago,
Henry burned his hand

18:34.581 --> 18:35.815
while left alone?

18:35.848 --> 18:37.517
I had a job interview.

18:37.550 --> 18:39.386
There was something on TV
he didn't want to miss.

18:39.419 --> 18:41.421
He tried to make grilled cheese
while I was out.

18:41.454 --> 18:42.922
I was only gone an hour.

18:42.955 --> 18:45.325
Our database also turned up
an incident at school

18:45.358 --> 18:47.327
when no one came
to pick him up.

18:47.360 --> 18:49.196
A teacher took him home
with her?

18:49.229 --> 18:51.631
For a few hours
till I could get there.

18:51.664 --> 18:56.403
Mm, Kyle, my husband,
was supposed to do it.

18:56.436 --> 18:59.506
Unfortunately,
based on this pattern

18:59.539 --> 19:01.208
and Dr. Lewis' suspicion
of alcohol use,

19:01.241 --> 19:02.875
we'll need to remove

19:02.909 --> 19:06.213
the children from the home,
pending further investigation.

19:09.649 --> 19:11.284
What?

19:11.318 --> 19:12.785
Since their father
is able

19:12.819 --> 19:16.223
to provide care, Adam and Henry
will be placed with him.

19:17.690 --> 19:20.727
I'm not...

19:20.760 --> 19:22.495
I'm not a bad mother.

19:22.529 --> 19:23.896
It's just for a
little while, Paula,

19:23.930 --> 19:26.633
until you can get back
on your feet.

19:26.666 --> 19:27.700
Most cases like this

19:27.734 --> 19:30.470
are resolved
within six months.

19:32.239 --> 19:34.807
I-I had breakfast
with my lawyer.

19:34.841 --> 19:36.243
We had to go over the papers.

19:36.276 --> 19:37.477
Do you understand
what I've told you,

19:37.510 --> 19:38.511
Mrs. Martin?

19:38.545 --> 19:42.949
He-he ordered me a Bloody Mary.

19:42.982 --> 19:47.287
He said
everything would be okay.

19:50.557 --> 19:52.759
Do you play the drums?

19:54.427 --> 19:59.432
No. My dad hasn't moved
his stuff out yet.

19:59.466 --> 20:02.702
So that's your magic wand.

20:05.305 --> 20:07.440
Do you believe in it?

20:07.474 --> 20:09.476
Magic?

20:09.509 --> 20:12.879
Some sorts, I suppose.

20:12.912 --> 20:15.248
Yeah. Me, neither.

20:16.015 --> 20:18.385
Henry...

20:18.418 --> 20:20.353
I'm sleepy, Mom.

20:20.387 --> 20:22.489
I know.

20:25.925 --> 20:26.493
Hey, big guy.

20:26.526 --> 20:27.660
Dad!

20:27.694 --> 20:28.895
Hey, buddy.

20:28.928 --> 20:30.997
You okay?

20:31.030 --> 20:32.832
Adam fell out
of the cart.

20:32.865 --> 20:36.002
He hit his head
on the floor.

20:38.871 --> 20:40.373
How is he?

20:40.407 --> 20:42.475
He's making
some eye contact.

20:42.509 --> 20:44.243
It's a good sign.

20:45.378 --> 20:47.280
I'm sorry.

20:47.314 --> 20:49.349
If you want to mess
up your own life,
that's fine.

20:51.584 --> 20:52.685
I was upset.

20:52.719 --> 20:54.587
I-I... I just came
from my lawyer.

20:54.621 --> 20:56.055
Adam was crying...

20:56.088 --> 20:57.524
So-so i-it's Adam's fault?

20:57.557 --> 20:58.691
It's my fault?

20:58.725 --> 21:00.360
I got here
as fast as I could.

21:00.393 --> 21:02.028
How come it's never
your fault, Paula?

21:02.061 --> 21:03.396
It's never your fault.

21:12.004 --> 21:14.341
A little
suction, Annie?

21:14.374 --> 21:15.041
Ally?

21:15.074 --> 21:17.544
Oh, it's Abby.

21:17.577 --> 21:19.346
Tenth unit type-
specific going up.

21:19.346 --> 21:20.680
( sighs )

21:20.713 --> 21:22.749
You know, Elizabeth,
if I had another inch,

21:22.782 --> 21:24.484
I'd be a happy man.

21:24.517 --> 21:27.587
Maybe then you wouldn't feel
such a need to show off.

21:27.620 --> 21:29.389
Slide the distal stick
another centimeter.

21:29.422 --> 21:31.057
Damn it.
Give me your hand.

21:31.090 --> 21:32.959
Easy, ducky,
I got it.

21:32.992 --> 21:34.561
Okay, folks,
here we go,
a new target--

21:34.594 --> 21:36.996
six centimeters of
IVC repair in 30 minutes.

21:37.029 --> 21:38.398
30 minutes?

21:38.431 --> 21:39.599
Dr. Dorset?

21:39.632 --> 21:42.669
I'm not sure
you have the stamina.

21:42.702 --> 21:43.936
It's your wife on the line.

21:48.708 --> 21:50.042
Take a message.

21:56.115 --> 21:58.017
Leave your reading
glasses at home?

21:58.050 --> 22:01.087
Well, they really
don't help that much.

22:01.120 --> 22:02.689
Is your vision better
in the periphery?

22:02.722 --> 22:04.724
I can take a look with
the ophthalmoscope.

22:04.757 --> 22:08.495
Not unless you know a cure
for macular degeneration.

22:08.528 --> 22:11.598
( sighs )

22:11.631 --> 22:14.767
Well, there are a lot
of new treatments--

22:14.801 --> 22:17.136
photodynamic
therapy, rhuFab...

22:17.169 --> 22:19.872
That's for...
that's for wet MD.

22:19.906 --> 22:22.542
I-I have the dry kind.

22:23.610 --> 22:25.678
How far along are you?

22:25.712 --> 22:27.414
Far enough.

22:29.549 --> 22:30.917
The paramedics
brought this in.

22:30.950 --> 22:34.454
It's an empty
bottle of digoxin.

22:34.487 --> 22:35.822
Oh. Congratulations.

22:35.855 --> 22:37.123
Mystery solved.

22:37.156 --> 22:40.026
The prescription
was filled yesterday.

22:40.059 --> 22:43.530
Uh... can-can I...
can I go now?

22:43.563 --> 22:45.865
I'm worried it
wasn't an accident.

22:45.898 --> 22:47.033
E-Excuse me?

22:47.066 --> 22:48.868
Have you had
suicidal thoughts?

22:48.901 --> 22:52.138
Yes, yes, in the, uh...
in the seventh grade.

22:52.171 --> 22:55.107
I was a...
I was a pudgy child.

22:55.141 --> 22:57.043
If you don't answer
the question seriously,

22:57.076 --> 22:58.545
I'll put you on a
psychiatric hold.

22:58.578 --> 23:01.013
Have you ever
considered suicide?

23:01.047 --> 23:03.516
Look, I'm-I'm a 71-year-old man
who's going blind.

23:03.550 --> 23:04.984
I've considered everything.

23:05.017 --> 23:07.487
I'd be... I'd be crazy
if I didn't.

23:07.520 --> 23:09.188
Dr. Lewis, hot MI rolling in.

23:09.221 --> 23:10.089
Okay.

23:10.122 --> 23:11.591
Do me a favor.

23:11.624 --> 23:14.060
Will you talk to someone
about these issues?

23:14.093 --> 23:15.562
What-what issues?

23:15.595 --> 23:16.929
Your diminished
visual capacity,

23:16.963 --> 23:18.865
your compromised
ability to self-medicate,

23:18.898 --> 23:20.700
the depression...

23:20.733 --> 23:23.002
Let-let-let me see
if I understand.

23:23.035 --> 23:26.172
You won't keep me here
involuntarily

23:26.205 --> 23:28.741
if I volunteer?

23:28.775 --> 23:30.042
My way will take a few hours.

23:30.076 --> 23:31.678
If I put you
on a psychiatric hold,

23:31.711 --> 23:34.046
you'll be here for three days.

23:49.962 --> 23:54.133
Dad, he looked at me.

23:54.166 --> 24:00.172
Hey. You okay, little man?
Are you okay?

24:06.012 --> 24:07.246
Mom!

24:07.279 --> 24:12.819
Adam's waking up. Mom.

24:12.852 --> 24:13.820
Paula, Paula?

24:13.853 --> 24:15.822
I forgot something
in my car.

24:28.167 --> 24:29.602
MAN:
I've been here
less than a month,

24:29.636 --> 24:30.537
and I already hate
the place.

24:30.570 --> 24:31.971
That's a step up.

24:32.004 --> 24:35.975
You hated your internship
after the first day.

24:52.825 --> 24:54.694
Mom. Mom!

24:54.727 --> 24:56.863
LEWIS:
Oh, my God.
Mom!

24:56.896 --> 24:59.298
( screaming ):
Mom!

24:59.331 --> 24:59.899
Mom!

24:59.932 --> 25:00.967
Mom!

25:01.000 --> 25:03.135
Get an ambu-bag and a gurney!

25:03.169 --> 25:05.872
Mom! Mom!

25:05.905 --> 25:06.973
Mom!

25:09.976 --> 25:11.243
Mom!

25:13.913 --> 25:15.615
Luka!

25:41.240 --> 25:42.174
Paula?

25:42.208 --> 25:49.849
Paula, can
you hear me?

25:51.217 --> 25:52.084
Partial and full
thickness burns

25:52.118 --> 25:53.252
over 90% of her body.

25:53.285 --> 25:55.087
Singed nasal hairs,
soot in the mouth.

25:55.121 --> 25:56.255
Move those people away!

25:56.288 --> 25:57.724
Oh, the smell.

25:57.757 --> 25:58.991
Don't breathe
through your nose.

25:59.025 --> 26:01.127
PAULA ( weakly ):
I saw him.

26:01.160 --> 26:02.194
COOP:
Give her something for pain?

26:02.228 --> 26:03.896
PAULA:
Saw him see me.

26:03.930 --> 26:05.031
SAM:
130/85.

26:05.064 --> 26:06.766
Okay, push ten
of morphine.

26:06.799 --> 26:09.268
Someone, put up
a screen here.

26:09.301 --> 26:11.871
KOVAC:
Paula, you have a lot
of burns over your body,

26:11.904 --> 26:13.239
including your throat.

26:13.272 --> 26:15.207
What happened to your head?
I'm fine.

26:15.241 --> 26:16.676
Take him to a room
and get him cleaned up.

26:16.709 --> 26:17.744
Really, I'm fine.

26:17.777 --> 26:19.011
All right, just dress it here.

26:19.045 --> 26:21.213
( raspy breathing )

26:21.247 --> 26:22.982
( coughing )

26:23.015 --> 26:25.217
Am I going to die?

26:25.251 --> 26:27.654
We need to put a tube
down your throat for oxygen.

26:27.654 --> 26:29.121
You won't be
able to talk.

26:29.155 --> 26:30.923
How long?

26:33.993 --> 26:35.762
I'm dead, aren't I?

26:35.795 --> 26:39.065
Mrs. Martin, do you
want us to intubate?

26:39.098 --> 26:40.266
No, I need to
talk to my son.

26:40.299 --> 26:42.001
I want to explain.

26:42.034 --> 26:43.202
Poor chest excursion.

26:43.235 --> 26:45.171
She might need
an escharotomy.

26:45.204 --> 26:46.238
Paula,

26:46.272 --> 26:47.874
can you feel this?

26:47.907 --> 26:49.676
KOVAC:
She burned all
her nerve endings.

26:49.709 --> 26:51.110
Prep with Betadine.
Ten blade.

26:51.143 --> 26:52.144
Get ready to intubate.

26:59.351 --> 27:01.821
( raspy breathing )

27:02.889 --> 27:03.990
( retching )

27:04.023 --> 27:05.357
Step back, Morris.

27:05.391 --> 27:07.359
She's got what,
90% body surface area burns?

27:07.393 --> 27:09.328
That means...
10% chance of surviving.

27:09.361 --> 27:10.697
For what?

27:10.697 --> 27:11.263
A few days in
a burn unit,

27:11.297 --> 27:12.298
till she gets septic

27:12.331 --> 27:14.233
and dies from the infection?

27:14.266 --> 27:16.135
It's not my party, but the lady
doesn't want to be tubed.

27:16.168 --> 27:18.771
She's suicidal. That overrides
her right to refuse care.

27:18.805 --> 27:19.906
( raspy breathing )

27:19.939 --> 27:21.307
SAM:
Is she a psych patient?

27:21.340 --> 27:22.975
I thought
she was that baby's mother.

27:23.009 --> 27:24.744
Oh, God.

27:25.978 --> 27:28.280
( paper crinkling )

27:28.314 --> 27:29.982
Hey, loose lips.

27:30.016 --> 27:31.083
Corday around?

27:31.117 --> 27:32.218
I have some post-op films
for her.

27:32.251 --> 27:33.753
Why don't you
leave them here?

27:33.786 --> 27:35.722
I'll make sure
she sees them.

27:35.722 --> 27:37.389
I'm in no mood
for a demonstration

27:37.423 --> 27:40.092
of female solidarity.

27:42.294 --> 27:45.097
Elizabeth.
Elizabeth.

27:45.131 --> 27:46.933
Can you...
can you slow down, please?

27:46.966 --> 27:48.100
She's doing an elective

27:48.134 --> 27:49.168
at Boston
Children's Hospital.

27:49.201 --> 27:51.437
She's a student?

27:51.470 --> 27:54.240
Things have been very, very
strained between us.

27:54.273 --> 27:56.743
I haven't slept with her.
It's been, like, weeks.

27:56.743 --> 27:58.110
Months, I meant months.

27:58.144 --> 28:00.747
So, what did you do,
hide her pictures in a drawer?

28:00.780 --> 28:04.751
It was a cabinet
actually.

28:04.784 --> 28:08.955
Uh... you're not going
to call her, are you?

28:11.423 --> 28:13.893
Oh, come on.
You've got to be kidding me.

28:13.926 --> 28:17.897
Coffee-- is it
too bloody much to ask?

28:32.812 --> 28:34.346
Well, at least we had a shot
with this guy.

28:34.380 --> 28:35.848
It says here that most
blunt abdominal injuries

28:35.882 --> 28:36.983
die at the scene.

28:37.016 --> 28:39.986
That's blunt aortic injury.

28:40.853 --> 28:42.488
Oh, right.

28:46.793 --> 28:48.928
Thanks.

28:48.961 --> 28:53.465
Still, he probably would've
thrombosed in post-op anyway.

28:53.499 --> 28:57.136
Well,
it's a complicated procedure.

28:57.169 --> 29:01.507
Yes, more so today than usual.

29:03.843 --> 29:08.380
And to think that I was worried
about it being too soon

29:08.414 --> 29:11.217
when the real problem was
I was allowing myself

29:11.250 --> 29:14.887
to feel something
for an absolute...

29:14.921 --> 29:16.188
Bastard?

29:18.224 --> 29:19.225
Jerk?

29:21.160 --> 29:22.394
Wanker?

29:22.428 --> 29:26.098
( laughing )

29:26.132 --> 29:28.835
And I knew it. I knew it.

29:28.868 --> 29:31.137
There's no shame in that.

29:33.439 --> 29:35.074
SATs 97 on 100%.

29:35.107 --> 29:36.208
KOVAC:
Urine output?

29:36.242 --> 29:38.845
Uh... over 100cc's per hour.

29:38.878 --> 29:39.912
Okay, we'll wait
to intubate her

29:39.946 --> 29:42.849
until she's seen
her kids.

29:42.882 --> 29:44.383
( whispers ):
Henry.

29:44.416 --> 29:45.551
I'm going
to go see him right now.

29:45.584 --> 29:48.054
I'll be back
in a minute.

29:48.087 --> 29:48.855
KOVAC:
Come on, guys.

29:48.888 --> 29:50.857
Get back to work.

29:50.890 --> 29:51.557
You want me
to talk to the father?

29:51.590 --> 29:53.125
No, I'll do it.

29:53.159 --> 29:55.995
You seem a little...
No, I'll do it, Luka.

29:56.028 --> 29:57.529
I don't even know if that
kid should go in there

29:57.563 --> 29:59.365
because it
could traumatize
him even further.

29:59.398 --> 30:01.533
So could
never seeing her again.

30:01.567 --> 30:03.836
I never shouldn't brought
Children's Services into this.

30:03.870 --> 30:05.905
You were looking out
for those kids.

30:05.938 --> 30:08.841
The fact that she did this
proves you were right.

30:08.875 --> 30:11.010
Yeah, all it did was
cost them their mother.

30:13.279 --> 30:16.082
( door opening )

30:16.115 --> 30:19.385
( sighs ):
Can you take Henry
to the family room?

30:19.418 --> 30:21.620
No, I don't want to go.

30:21.653 --> 30:25.391
We have a TV and
candy in there.

30:25.424 --> 30:27.226
Dad?

30:27.259 --> 30:29.395
Uh, you know what, buddy.
Do me a favor.

30:29.428 --> 30:30.897
Come over here.

30:30.930 --> 30:32.198
Watch over Adam for me, okay?

30:32.231 --> 30:33.332
Call the Burn Unit

30:33.365 --> 30:35.534
and make sure
they have a bed ready.

30:40.106 --> 30:44.543
God... what the
hell happened here?

30:44.576 --> 30:47.113
I knew she was
messed up, but I...

30:47.146 --> 30:50.917
I never imagined
anything like this.

30:50.950 --> 30:52.251
( sighs )

30:52.284 --> 30:53.285
How is she?

30:53.319 --> 30:55.321
She's not doing well.

30:58.958 --> 31:01.928
She told him to lie.

31:01.961 --> 31:03.295
They didn't go back
for hot dogs.

31:03.329 --> 31:05.064
She wanted to pick up some beer.

31:08.467 --> 31:10.269
Adam's going to be all right.

31:10.302 --> 31:11.337
He's responding well.

31:12.972 --> 31:14.673
I shouldn't have never filed
for custody.

31:14.706 --> 31:18.144
I should've just grabbed these
kids and run away somewhere.

31:18.177 --> 31:20.579
She wants to see Henry.

31:22.348 --> 31:25.084
Look, Mr. Martin, I know
this is a very difficult time

31:25.117 --> 31:26.685
and you're angry.

31:26.718 --> 31:29.588
But she's going to die
and you need to think about

31:29.621 --> 31:32.124
what's best in the long run
for him.

31:32.158 --> 31:34.560
She wants him
to see her like that?

31:34.593 --> 31:36.662
She wants to say good-bye.

31:37.729 --> 31:39.966
No.

31:39.999 --> 31:42.468
I won't.

31:42.501 --> 31:44.136
Well, no one's going
to make you

31:44.170 --> 31:46.472
do anything
you don't want to do.

31:46.505 --> 31:49.141
( voice cracks ):
I don't want to.

31:49.175 --> 31:50.576
Please.

31:50.609 --> 31:51.978
I heard she was nuts.

31:52.011 --> 31:53.145
I heard we were
taking her kids away.

31:53.179 --> 31:54.546
That'd make anybody nuts.

31:54.580 --> 31:56.448
Enough to do a kamikaze
in front of your own son?

31:56.482 --> 31:58.384
I don't know.
Never been there.

31:58.417 --> 31:59.618
Where? I'll take you.

31:59.651 --> 32:01.487
( laughs ):
Yeah, I bet you would.

32:01.520 --> 32:02.588
New girl's kind
of intense, huh?

32:02.621 --> 32:03.990
God, I wish this
shift was over.

32:04.023 --> 32:06.525
So why don't you
call it a night?

32:06.558 --> 32:07.559
I don't want everybody to
think I'm some kind of wuss.

32:07.593 --> 32:09.361
It's too late for that.

32:09.395 --> 32:12.131
COOP:
Some kind of wuss?
Isn't that a movie?

32:12.164 --> 32:14.200
ROMANO:
So, they move
that psycho-mobile yet?

32:14.233 --> 32:15.667
Yeah, the bay's
clear to traffic.

32:15.701 --> 32:17.536
They'll be towing it
out in a little while.

32:17.569 --> 32:19.305
She couldn't park
around the corner, huh?

32:19.338 --> 32:21.140
You sure you should
be doing that?

32:21.173 --> 32:22.574
You said you were a doctor.

32:22.608 --> 32:24.010
I am a doctor.

32:24.010 --> 32:25.044
Then what are you?

32:25.077 --> 32:26.412
That's
a good question.

32:26.445 --> 32:28.247
How's that for wound
approximation?

32:28.280 --> 32:29.448
Utah arm's working
for you, huh?

32:29.481 --> 32:30.616
Yeah,
better than you are.

32:30.649 --> 32:32.084
Finish this up
for me, will ya?

32:32.118 --> 32:34.253
Hey, wh-what are you doing?

32:34.286 --> 32:35.621
Scar control.

32:35.654 --> 32:38.090
Hey, Chuny,
can you get me some 4-0 nylon

32:38.124 --> 32:39.425
and a fresh needle driver?

32:39.458 --> 32:40.592
I thought Romano was doing that.

32:40.626 --> 32:42.761
Yeah, right, he was.

32:42.794 --> 32:45.097
Would you-would you
get Dr. Lewis for me?

32:45.131 --> 32:46.765
She's in
with another patient.

32:46.798 --> 32:48.267
She said
it would be three hours.

32:48.300 --> 32:49.401
I've been here over four now.

32:49.435 --> 32:51.203
The counselor's
on his way, sir.

32:51.237 --> 32:54.506
Just a little longer.
I promise.

33:05.317 --> 33:07.386
KOVAC:
This patient is one of ours?
From today?

33:07.419 --> 33:08.687
SAM:
I think I remember her.

33:08.720 --> 33:09.355
How long was she in Triage?

33:09.388 --> 33:10.489
Not sure.

33:10.522 --> 33:12.758
GCS 2-2-3.
Left pupil blown.

33:12.791 --> 33:16.062
SAM:
Whoa. Careful, sir.

33:16.095 --> 33:18.064
KOVAC:
Okay, hold it.

33:18.097 --> 33:19.431
Get me her chart.

33:19.465 --> 33:22.301
Anybody here
recognize this woman?

33:23.835 --> 33:26.072
Both of you, come with me.

33:30.076 --> 33:31.610
Head lac and a hangover.

33:31.643 --> 33:33.712
Spontaneous resps,
but hypoventilating.

33:33.745 --> 33:35.347
You knew about this patient?

33:35.381 --> 33:36.382
I'm not sure. Maybe.

33:36.415 --> 33:38.284
BP's up: 177/96.

33:38.317 --> 33:39.585
She was waiting
for 11 hours

33:39.618 --> 33:41.087
and left without being seen.

33:41.120 --> 33:41.753
I don't know.

33:41.787 --> 33:43.289
What's her name?

33:43.322 --> 33:44.790
Athena.

33:44.823 --> 33:46.525
Like the goddess.

33:46.558 --> 33:47.693
COOP:
Hypertensive,
bradycardic.

33:47.726 --> 33:49.361
Lady's got
a massive brain bleed.

33:49.395 --> 33:50.596
20 of etomidate
and 100 of SUX.

33:50.629 --> 33:52.098
8-0 ET tube and a mac three.

33:52.131 --> 33:53.132
You better let me do that.

33:53.165 --> 33:55.267
It was my miss. Let me try.

33:55.301 --> 33:56.368
Etomidate and SUX.

33:56.402 --> 33:57.369
SAM:
Heart rate's down to 54.

33:57.403 --> 33:59.105
Systolic's 198.

33:59.105 --> 34:00.106
I can't see crap.

34:00.139 --> 34:01.140
Careful, watch the teeth.

34:01.807 --> 34:04.343
SAM:
51, 48, 47...

34:04.376 --> 34:07.413
Okay, okay, I
see chords. Tube.

34:10.581 --> 34:11.449
It won't pass.

34:11.483 --> 34:14.120
V-fib. Lost the pulse.

34:14.120 --> 34:15.121
( Morris groans )

34:15.154 --> 34:16.255
The tube is too big.

34:16.288 --> 34:17.123
COOP:
Starting compressions.

34:17.156 --> 34:18.424
Okay, settle down.

34:20.359 --> 34:21.726
One milligram of epi,

34:21.760 --> 34:23.795
charge to 200.

34:24.862 --> 34:26.364
KOVAC:
In.

34:26.398 --> 34:27.632
Clear!

34:31.503 --> 34:33.405
He's awake and alert.

34:33.438 --> 34:36.408
PAULA:
Oh, God.

34:37.476 --> 34:41.647
( softly ):
Thank you.

34:43.149 --> 34:46.351
Can I can see him?

34:53.192 --> 34:55.460
Can I touch him?

34:56.795 --> 34:59.331
Sure.

35:05.871 --> 35:07.506
He's been reaching out
at objects

35:07.539 --> 35:09.508
and looking back at people.

35:09.541 --> 35:12.811
He's going to be
fine, Mrs. Martin.

35:13.845 --> 35:17.283
( groans )

35:17.316 --> 35:19.485
LEWIS:
Oh, that's the tears.

35:19.518 --> 35:22.188
( moans )

35:24.923 --> 35:26.258
Henry?

35:29.328 --> 35:32.231
He's pretty upset.

35:34.366 --> 35:36.268
He won't come in?

35:36.302 --> 35:38.404
No.

35:41.273 --> 35:44.376
Mm...

35:44.410 --> 35:47.213
It's better.

35:55.521 --> 35:57.656
I need to write something.

35:57.689 --> 35:59.225
Can you help me?

35:59.258 --> 36:01.360
Can you help me
write for him?

36:01.393 --> 36:03.229
I can write it down.

36:03.262 --> 36:04.363
Dr. Lewis.

36:04.396 --> 36:05.864
Yeah.

36:05.897 --> 36:09.401
Henry...

36:15.574 --> 36:19.711
Try to forget.

36:19.745 --> 36:21.347
Remember I love you.

36:26.418 --> 36:29.921
COOP:
Charging to 360. Clear.

36:29.955 --> 36:31.323
No rhythm...

36:31.357 --> 36:33.292
No pulse.
Another round of epi?

36:33.325 --> 36:34.526
No.

36:34.560 --> 36:38.564
Asystole. Uh, how
about dopamine?

36:38.597 --> 36:39.631
KOVAC:
It's almost an hour.

36:39.665 --> 36:41.667
We're done.

36:42.968 --> 36:44.370
Five-minute physical exam

36:44.403 --> 36:46.338
could've picked
up the bleed.

36:47.506 --> 36:49.675
We would've had
time to operate.

36:49.708 --> 36:53.979
Instead, she waited 11 hours
and left without being seen.

36:54.012 --> 36:56.782
This woman had
nowhere else to go.

36:56.815 --> 36:59.485
If we can't find a way
to take care of people like her,

36:59.518 --> 37:00.786
nobody will.

37:17.068 --> 37:19.471
FREDDY:
Get me out
of here!

37:19.505 --> 37:22.808
Why are you
experimenting on me?

37:22.841 --> 37:25.644
Please, somebody!

37:25.677 --> 37:27.446
Somebody, help!

37:27.479 --> 37:29.815
( crying ):
Honey, I need you!

37:29.848 --> 37:31.483
He's taking me away!

37:31.517 --> 37:33.985
He's getting me
out of here!

37:34.019 --> 37:36.388
Take me away!

37:37.856 --> 37:39.425
Hey, can you get that guy
back in here?

37:39.458 --> 37:40.559
Hey, Morris.

37:40.592 --> 37:41.860
Wait, wait, wait.
Morris, hey, hey.

37:41.893 --> 37:42.994
Where are you going?

37:43.028 --> 37:44.330
We've still got
two hours left.

37:44.363 --> 37:45.497
Triage is all backed up.

37:45.531 --> 37:46.865
I've had enough, okay?
I quit.

37:46.898 --> 37:48.334
What?

37:48.367 --> 37:49.935
We didn't get this far
to just walk away.

37:49.968 --> 37:51.470
I only got this far because
you've been carrying me!

37:51.503 --> 37:53.071
I haven't.
Come on...

37:53.104 --> 37:54.506
I haven't been...
I'm sick of
being carried!

37:54.540 --> 37:57.843
Morris, you bailing?

37:57.876 --> 38:00.546
Let him walk.

38:00.579 --> 38:02.648
Don't miss your train,
sweetie.

38:07.586 --> 38:10.389
Hey, he's just testing you,
Mor... Morris!

38:11.723 --> 38:13.058
You just tested him, right?

38:13.091 --> 38:14.660
Hmm-mm.

38:17.062 --> 38:18.864
Great. That worked out well.

38:18.897 --> 38:20.566
Listen, everybody's
not cut out for this.

38:20.599 --> 38:21.933
Yeah.

38:21.967 --> 38:23.869
Let's get back to work,
and remember,

38:23.902 --> 38:25.871
the jury's still
out on you.

38:29.608 --> 38:30.776
No one's answering
at his home.

38:30.809 --> 38:32.511
You don't have a car,
do you?

38:32.544 --> 38:33.712
( sighs )

38:33.745 --> 38:35.547
I knew I should've
put him on hold

38:35.581 --> 38:37.716
or had a guard sitting
by the door.

38:37.749 --> 38:39.585
Hi, this is Dr. Lewis
from the county ER.

38:39.618 --> 38:42.588
I need a unit dispatched
for a possible suicide.

38:42.621 --> 38:44.423
I'm on hold.

38:44.456 --> 38:45.891
Paula's on a vent.

38:45.924 --> 38:47.559
They're ready to move
her to the burn unit.

38:47.593 --> 38:50.128
Did you write down
everything she needed to say?

38:50.161 --> 38:52.063
I'll give it
to Mr. Martin.

38:52.097 --> 38:54.566
Okay. Tell Paula
that I'll come
check on her later,

38:54.600 --> 38:56.902
and have them page me
if anything happens.

38:58.470 --> 38:59.571
Hey, you guys going
on a run?

38:59.605 --> 39:00.739
Nope, just
brought one in.

39:00.772 --> 39:02.541
Can you do something
for me?

39:13.184 --> 39:14.753
( classical music blaring )

39:14.786 --> 39:16.455
( knocking )

39:19.625 --> 39:22.761
Is... is there a problem?

39:25.130 --> 39:27.599
Hey, are you contemplating
your career change?

39:27.633 --> 39:29.100
Yeah, something
like that.

39:29.134 --> 39:30.602
This is Dr. Corday.

39:30.636 --> 39:32.471
Elizabeth's fine.

39:32.504 --> 39:34.105
Pleased to meet
you. Sam Taggart.

39:34.139 --> 39:35.607
It's her first day.

39:35.641 --> 39:39.645
Uh, yeah, you have
that County glaze about you.

39:39.678 --> 39:42.648
Um, I hope it wasn't
too terrible.

39:42.681 --> 39:44.650
That's not like
my last few jobs.

39:44.683 --> 39:49.120
I'm used to getting hit hard:
MVA, GSW,

39:49.154 --> 39:51.189
knife in the eye.

39:51.222 --> 39:54.793
Here, you... you get a chance
to catch your breath,

39:54.826 --> 39:56.495
clear your head once in a while.

39:56.528 --> 39:57.963
Yeah, that's what
I love about County:

39:57.996 --> 39:59.130
all the quiet time.

39:59.164 --> 40:01.132
Yeah.

40:02.834 --> 40:04.536
So, you used to be a nurse?

40:04.570 --> 40:05.971
I still am. I guess.

40:06.004 --> 40:08.540
I'm going to be taking
shifts for a while.

40:08.574 --> 40:09.741
You're in transition?

40:09.775 --> 40:11.577
Kind of.

40:11.610 --> 40:15.647
Eh, that's a good place to be.

40:15.681 --> 40:17.783
Um, well, we're on our way
to grab something to eat.

40:17.816 --> 40:19.050
You want to join us?

40:19.084 --> 40:21.820
Oh... I still got
a few hours to go.

40:21.853 --> 40:25.023
I'm just waiting on my guy.

40:25.056 --> 40:28.193
Hey! In fact...
here he is.

40:28.226 --> 40:29.027
You two have a good night.

40:29.060 --> 40:31.997
Mm-hmm.
You, too.

40:35.100 --> 40:36.768
Is this your new hospital?

40:36.802 --> 40:38.103
Yep.

40:38.136 --> 40:40.171
It's even crappier
than the last one.

40:40.205 --> 40:41.707
Hey, watch it, kiddo.

40:43.609 --> 40:45.944
We can't take
care of them if
we never see them.

40:45.977 --> 40:48.146
Cooper-- there,
Neela-- there.

40:48.179 --> 40:50.516
Gallant, over there.

40:50.549 --> 40:53.218
Neela, are you with us?
Neela?

40:55.286 --> 40:57.222
Yeah.

40:57.255 --> 41:00.492
We provide good care,
and we're going to do it faster.

41:01.993 --> 41:03.962
Everybody, listen up.

41:03.995 --> 41:05.964
We're going to form a line
down the hall,

41:05.997 --> 41:08.166
and you'll be examined
three at a time.

41:08.199 --> 41:09.234
Hey, I was here
before them.

41:09.267 --> 41:10.636
Really doesn't matter, sir.

41:10.669 --> 41:12.538
By 10:00, everybody here

41:12.538 --> 41:13.839
will have been examined
by a doctor.

41:15.541 --> 41:18.143
I-I waited over
three hours.

41:18.176 --> 41:20.612
No one... no one came.

41:20.646 --> 41:22.981
I kept... I
kept my promise.

41:23.014 --> 41:24.983
Thank you. You could've
answered the telephone.

41:25.016 --> 41:27.553
I like music
when I work.

41:28.687 --> 41:30.556
Is this your job?

41:30.589 --> 41:31.990
No, no, it's just a hobby.

41:32.023 --> 41:35.160
I used to make, uh...
architectural models.

41:36.562 --> 41:38.664
You're retired?

41:38.697 --> 41:44.035
You need two good
eyes for that...
that kind of work.

41:44.069 --> 41:46.872
Do you know of
a Crown Hall?

41:46.905 --> 41:48.306
Down at IIT?

41:48.339 --> 41:52.944
Yeah, that was designed
by Mies van der Rohe.

41:52.978 --> 41:55.747
Yeah, I've heard of him.

41:55.781 --> 41:58.016
Mies and I worked
together in the, uh...

41:58.049 --> 41:59.618
in the '60s.

41:59.651 --> 42:01.086
This is beautiful.

42:01.119 --> 42:02.921
Mies lived his
life by the...

42:02.954 --> 42:05.924
by the laws of
architecture:

42:05.957 --> 42:08.927
order, space... proportion.

42:08.960 --> 42:11.096
One: there has
to be an...

42:11.129 --> 42:12.831
Is someone pouring your pills
for you?

42:12.864 --> 42:14.900
internal logic... an-an order--

42:14.933 --> 42:16.234
in-in any design.

42:16.267 --> 42:18.604
I can set you up
with a weekly pill dispenser

42:18.637 --> 42:20.606
to avoid any other mishaps.

42:20.639 --> 42:21.740
Two: space

42:21.773 --> 42:23.241
is the real work of art.

42:23.274 --> 42:26.244
The... the building
merely exists to...

42:26.277 --> 42:28.046
to-to shape it.

42:28.079 --> 42:32.083
I could also arrange
for a visiting nurse to stop by.

42:32.117 --> 42:34.219
And three: proportion.

42:34.252 --> 42:37.288
Always be aware
of how the structure fits

42:37.322 --> 42:38.156
into the...

42:38.189 --> 42:39.791
I want to help you.

42:39.825 --> 42:41.927
( pager beeping )
the-the world
around it.

42:41.960 --> 42:43.629
Is that your
boyfriend?

42:44.663 --> 42:47.633
Uh, no, it's a patient.

42:47.633 --> 42:49.267
I thought I was
your only one.

42:49.300 --> 42:50.301
I have to go. She's dying.

42:50.335 --> 42:51.637
I need you to promise me

42:51.670 --> 42:52.804
you're not going
to kill yourself

42:52.838 --> 42:55.273
in the next 72 hours.

42:55.306 --> 42:58.076
But... but M-Monday
would be okay?

42:58.109 --> 43:00.245
I'm off the hook by then.

43:00.278 --> 43:02.648
Oh, so this is
kind of a...

43:02.648 --> 43:04.149
a career move for you?

43:08.153 --> 43:10.722
Okay, it's a...
it's a deal.

43:10.756 --> 43:12.658
NEELA:
Tinea versicolor?

43:12.691 --> 43:13.959
It's a superficial
fungal infection.

43:13.992 --> 43:16.061
Clotrimazole cream
twice a day for two weeks.

43:16.094 --> 43:17.963
Shouldn't we take
a scraping and do
a KOH stain?

43:17.996 --> 43:19.665
No reason to. Just treat it.

43:21.166 --> 43:22.233
It's killing me.

43:22.267 --> 43:23.669
Vesicles on the drum.

43:23.669 --> 43:26.137
Bullous myringitis
caused by mycoplasma?

43:26.171 --> 43:27.973
Erythromycin
for ten days.

43:29.675 --> 43:30.809
Leftover Chinese food.

43:30.842 --> 43:32.778
My husband never throws
anything out.

43:32.811 --> 43:34.145
Benign belly.

43:34.179 --> 43:36.682
Compazine suppository
and check posturals.

43:36.715 --> 43:38.316
What are you
nutmeats doing?

43:38.349 --> 43:39.985
Clearing Triage.

43:46.191 --> 43:47.993
Excellent.
