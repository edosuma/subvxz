Well, I got off work
a little early

12:36.505 --> 12:38.841
so I figured I'd whip us
up some dinner.

12:38.924 --> 12:41.677
Well, how'd you get in?

12:41.760 --> 12:44.138
What, you gave me the key
last night

12:44.221 --> 12:46.515
you know, because we're married.

12:48.142 --> 12:51.228
Well, give it back
'cause, uh, in about ten seconds

12:51.312 --> 12:53.522
we're gonna not be married
anymore 'cause you're gonna sign

12:53.606 --> 12:55.357
these annulment papers, see?

12:55.441 --> 12:56.859
Remember this morning
when you said

12:56.942 --> 12:58.152
it was gonna be
a really funny story?

12:58.235 --> 13:00.070
Well, ha ha.

13:02.114 --> 13:04.909
[sighs]
Give me the pen.

13:04.992 --> 13:06.452
There you go.

13:08.120 --> 13:10.539
Here you go.

13:10.623 --> 13:12.958
Y-you didn't sign here.

13:13.042 --> 13:15.044
Yeah. I'm not gonna, baby.

13:15.127 --> 13:16.295
Say what, baby?

13:17.838 --> 13:19.715
I don't wanna end this marriage.

13:19.798 --> 13:22.259
No, no, no, you have to.

13:22.343 --> 13:25.304
- Why?
- Because you're an adulterer.

13:27.181 --> 13:29.850
- No, I'm not.
- Wanna be?

13:32.144 --> 13:35.481
So that's it.
I missed my chance.

Vince leave New York'

13:37.566 --> 13:39.527

13:39.610 --> 13:42.446
Oops. I'm sorry, wait.

13:42.530 --> 13:44.281
Here I am talking about me
and Vincent.

13:44.365 --> 13:45.908
You have a crisis
with your sister.

13:45.991 --> 13:48.452
- Talk to me.
- I-I don't know, Holly.

13:48.536 --> 13:50.120
It's like my sister
doesn't think sometimes.

13:50.204 --> 13:52.831
Totally me. I mean,
if I would have just thought

13:52.915 --> 13:55.918
then maybe Vince and I..

13:56.001 --> 13:59.588
Sorry. Me again.
So, um, go on and, uh, tell me.

13:59.672 --> 14:01.715
- Your sister doesn't think.
- Or listen.

14:01.799 --> 14:04.426
Listen? You know who
I shouldn't have listened to?

14:04.510 --> 14:05.970
- Ricki.
- No, Lauren.

14:06.053 --> 14:08.472
Wait, h-how do you know Ricki?

14:08.556 --> 14:10.099
My sister's here.

14:12.226 --> 14:14.478
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

14:15.604 --> 14:16.730
What is wrong with you, Rick?

14:16.814 --> 14:17.773
You can't just pick up and drive

14:17.856 --> 14:19.149
down to Florida with some guy.

14:19.233 --> 14:21.569
'Mom and dad were so scared.'

14:27.908 --> 14:32.079
- You, Holly Tyler.
- Shh.

14:32.162 --> 14:34.748
Okay. Please don't say
my name out loud, okay?

14:34.832 --> 14:37.543
- Why not, Holly Tyler?
- Shh.

14:37.626 --> 14:41.422
There's someone here, him,
who can't know I'm here.

14:41.505 --> 14:44.258
- Got it?
- Who, Holly Tyler?

14:44.341 --> 14:47.303
- Holly Tyler, Holly Tyler--
- Shut up, shut up.

14:48.846 --> 14:51.223
Why, Holly Tyler?

14:56.895 --> 14:59.648
I don't know why.

14:59.732 --> 15:01.317
Will you at least call
mom and dad and tell them

15:01.400 --> 15:02.985
you're okay,
so they stop calling me?

15:03.068 --> 15:06.447
Fine, I'll call them,
but I'm not leaving here.

15:06.530 --> 15:07.948
Neither am I.

15:08.991 --> 15:11.327
Holly, what are you doing here?

15:11.410 --> 15:13.495
Yeah, what are you doing here?

15:13.579 --> 15:15.998
Vince?
This is the same Vince?

15:16.081 --> 15:18.626
You're the one..
I'm gonna get a drink.

15:19.918 --> 15:21.128
Holly, why are you here?

15:21.211 --> 15:23.339
She obviously followed us here.

15:23.422 --> 15:24.840
She's a stalker.

15:24.923 --> 15:26.675
No, I'm not a stalker

15:26.759 --> 15:27.843
and I didn't follow you.

15:27.926 --> 15:29.803
I hid in your backseat.

15:29.887 --> 15:31.096
You're so stupid.

15:32.765 --> 15:34.350
And for good reason.

15:35.601 --> 15:38.145
Look, there's something
that I've been trying

15:38.228 --> 15:41.982
to tell you for a long time
and I am sick of being unsure

15:42.066 --> 15:44.234
and scared and embarrassed.

15:46.612 --> 15:48.614
I love you, Vince.

15:50.074 --> 15:51.533
And this may not
be the right time

15:51.617 --> 15:54.119
and you may have already
moved on, but..

15:55.871 --> 15:59.458
...I am not going back to
New York until I tell you that

15:59.541 --> 16:04.171
I am completely and totally
in love with you.

16:06.965 --> 16:10.302
That's it. I said it.

which was delicious.

16:39.206 --> 16:41.792
I particularly liked
the little baby carrots.

16:41.875 --> 16:45.546
- The candles were nice too.
- Well, I'm a nice guy.

16:45.629 --> 16:48.006
Yes, you are,

I'm just seeing

No, I-I have to think.
That's what I do.

And I didn't think last night
and that's how this happened.
