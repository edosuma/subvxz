WEBVTT

00:10.177 --> 00:11.970
This is happening, Del Mar!

00:12.054 --> 00:13.347
Who's with me?

00:14.264 --> 00:15.432
I can't hear you.

00:16.099 --> 00:17.392
Who's with me?

00:25.150 --> 00:27.528
<i>Stop thinking about him.
You've got work to do.</i>

00:28.320 --> 00:29.988
Starting with our warm-up.

00:30.697 --> 00:32.073
Nice and easy.

00:32.658 --> 00:34.159
Stretch. Pull.

00:38.830 --> 00:41.750
<i>I said, stop thinking about him.
Get your head in the game.</i>

00:47.840 --> 00:50.551
Time to get out of that head
and get in that body.

00:50.551 --> 00:51.927
You got it.

00:53.220 --> 00:54.513
Take it up.

01:02.980 --> 01:06.066
<i>Who are you kidding?
You're not gonna stop. You're obsessed.</i>

01:08.610 --> 01:10.988
- Jesus! What the--
- You went past the X.

01:11.780 --> 01:14.199
No, I did not. That's right here.

01:14.283 --> 01:15.868
I didn't get past it.

01:17.286 --> 01:18.287
Shit.

01:19.121 --> 01:21.081
Well, okay. That's on us.

01:22.875 --> 01:23.876
So, we good?

01:24.710 --> 01:27.921
I don't think we're good
because we didn't figure out how this--

01:32.342 --> 01:33.677
How's that corn dog?

01:33.677 --> 01:37.181
It's actually just fried cheese
on a stick, and it's terrible.

01:37.681 --> 01:39.474
<i>Don't really care. Just being nice.</i>

01:39.558 --> 01:41.310
I thought your dad was coming today?

01:41.310 --> 01:43.312
He said he might try to stop by later.

01:43.312 --> 01:45.814
<i>He thinks you're the B-team.
An afterthought.</i>

01:45.898 --> 01:48.734
Did I sound okay out here?
Could you hear my voice over the music?

01:49.985 --> 01:51.945
We've got a chance
to pull a big crowd today,

01:52.029 --> 01:54.448
but not if they can't hear my voice
over the music.

01:56.074 --> 01:58.785
I hope that doesn't happen.
That would suck.

01:58.869 --> 01:59.995
Yeah.

02:00.495 --> 02:03.332
So, we need to make sure
that doesn't happen.

02:04.958 --> 02:06.126
Are you with me?

02:06.210 --> 02:09.713
<i>You think he cares?
No one cares unless you make them.</i>

02:09.795 --> 02:11.507
Kev. Kev!

02:11.507 --> 02:14.134
You may not give a shit about today,
but I do.

02:14.218 --> 02:16.637
This is my chance to actually level up
and sell this thing

02:16.637 --> 02:19.097
to more than two fucking women
at the grocery store at a time.

02:19.181 --> 02:21.058
- So let's lose the corn dog...
- Oh.

02:21.892 --> 02:24.937
...and use the fucking sound check
to check the fucking sound.

02:24.937 --> 02:28.524
<i>That's what I'm talking about.
Now throw the puppy a bone.</i>

02:28.524 --> 02:30.817
Why don't we both show Dad what we can do?

02:32.319 --> 02:33.320
Yes, sir.

02:36.615 --> 02:38.617
Gimme a blue! I want the blue!

02:38.617 --> 02:39.910
He won't give me the blue.

02:39.910 --> 02:41.370
Buddy. Buddy, buddy, buddy.

02:41.370 --> 02:42.704
Hey. Hey, look at me.

02:43.288 --> 02:45.415
You want the truth? Nobody likes to share.

02:45.499 --> 02:50.254
But everybody has to share if we expect
to live in a just and fair society.

02:50.254 --> 02:52.172
- Does that make sense to you?
- No, it does not.

02:52.256 --> 02:54.007
This is how we're gonna solve this. Watch.

02:54.091 --> 02:55.509
Now there's two blues. Yeah?

02:55.509 --> 02:57.344
You guys have fun today, okay?

02:57.344 --> 03:00.806
And be nice to Uncle Danny.
He's doing his best.

03:00.806 --> 03:02.391
Wait, wait, wait.

03:02.391 --> 03:04.059
What are you doing? You're not staying?

03:04.643 --> 03:07.688
No, I told Sheila I was gonna go
to see her big performance at the fair.

03:07.688 --> 03:09.565
I don't wanna let her down.
Is that a problem?

03:09.565 --> 03:11.900
No, no, no, it's not. I just--

03:11.984 --> 03:14.361
When you had said parent committee,

03:14.361 --> 03:18.574
I think what I figured was
there'd be a lot more, you know, parents.

03:18.574 --> 03:19.992
That's really funny. Yeah, no.

03:19.992 --> 03:22.953
Some meetings are more meeting-y
and some are, like, playdate-y.

03:25.080 --> 03:28.333
Hey. Okay, how about you
and Wanda can discuss ideas

03:28.417 --> 03:29.960
for the big fundraiser coming up?

03:29.960 --> 03:31.044
- Yep.
- Yeah?

03:31.128 --> 03:33.964
You can brainstorm some themes.

03:34.590 --> 03:37.176
Big picture stuff, right?
That's your thing. You like that.

03:37.176 --> 03:40.470
And then, I don't know, write them
down on some boards or something.

03:40.554 --> 03:43.390
Okay? You're gonna be great.
I'm proud of you.

03:43.390 --> 03:44.766
Bye!

03:46.393 --> 03:48.937
- Great pancakes, Mom.
- Thanks, dear.

03:49.021 --> 03:52.524
I wish I had an appetite like that.
I wish I had any appetite.

03:53.317 --> 03:55.402
Dr. Varsho wants me to gain more weight.

03:55.402 --> 03:56.528
That's a new one.

04:00.616 --> 04:01.867
What's that?

04:02.659 --> 04:04.328
You have a lot on your mind. I know.

04:05.120 --> 04:07.247
Wish I could come today
to the groundbreaking.

04:07.331 --> 04:09.374
You know,
if I didn't have to be off my feet now.

04:09.458 --> 04:13.128
It's just a photo op to make the investors
happy. I wouldn't want you to bother.

04:14.546 --> 04:17.716
Well, you know I would
if the doctor okayed it.

04:18.300 --> 04:19.301
Of course.

04:21.094 --> 04:24.431
So, kids at school are saying
there's gonna be some protest.

04:24.515 --> 04:26.892
Apparently, all the surf kids
are all pissed off about it.

04:27.476 --> 04:31.230
I walk through the smoking section every
day on my way to woodshop, so I hear the...

04:33.148 --> 04:34.149
What?

04:34.233 --> 04:36.944
Zeke. Language.

04:38.529 --> 04:39.530
Sorry.

04:43.951 --> 04:45.744
Well, I-I mean, actually,
it's just "pissed."

04:45.744 --> 04:47.871
That's really not that bad, right?

04:48.455 --> 04:51.333
If you wanna use bathroom words,
you can go straight to the bathroom!

04:51.333 --> 04:52.417
Now.

05:09.101 --> 05:10.936
<i>You've got this. You're in the groove now.</i>

05:11.812 --> 05:15.566
<i>Pump it to the left. Two, three, four.</i>

05:15.566 --> 05:20.028
<i>Take it back. Two, three, four.
Pick it up.</i>

05:22.322 --> 05:23.574
<i>Two more.</i>

05:24.241 --> 05:25.826
- Babe.
- <i>To the left.</i>

05:25.826 --> 05:27.661
Babe. Babe!

05:27.661 --> 05:28.745
What?

05:28.829 --> 05:31.498
Check it out. Fixed it.
It's ready to roll.

05:32.082 --> 05:35.669
The light's all mid-morning angular
right now. It should be perfect.

05:35.669 --> 05:38.547
- You don't look ready to roll.
- <i>Stay with me!</i>

05:39.256 --> 05:41.425
You think she's better than me?

05:41.425 --> 05:43.635
I mean,
you obviously think she's prettier.

05:43.719 --> 05:46.263
No way. She's just different.

05:46.972 --> 05:48.098
That means better.

05:48.932 --> 05:50.017
No, it means different.

05:50.017 --> 05:51.602
Is it 'cause she's skinnier?

05:52.269 --> 05:56.899
Is it her hair?
I mean-- 'Cause that shit is perfect.

05:57.482 --> 05:58.984
I think she got a wig.

05:58.984 --> 06:02.946
I think she got her teeth bleached
or maybe capped.

06:04.156 --> 06:06.617
They look like Chiclets and not even real!

06:07.576 --> 06:08.619
Hey!

06:08.619 --> 06:10.954
Sorry, babe. It just doesn't seem healthy.

06:11.038 --> 06:12.414
Neither are bong loads.

06:12.414 --> 06:13.707
Look, babe.

06:14.666 --> 06:19.046
I mean, I know everything didn't,
like, turn out as we expected, but--

06:19.046 --> 06:23.759
Okay, if you say everything happens for
a reason, I will slice open your nut sack.

06:23.759 --> 06:25.677
I'm not gonna say that anymore.

06:27.513 --> 06:29.806
But, babe, If I may?

06:30.307 --> 06:33.685
Aerobics was then. RollerBod is now.

06:33.769 --> 06:37.022
You know, like, we got a great new idea
for a fitness tape, and it's all ours.

06:37.022 --> 06:39.358
You know? It's got legs.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.819
No, it's got wheels. Oh, my God.

06:42.903 --> 06:45.781
Is that a good catchphrase,
or is that the best catchphrase?

06:47.366 --> 06:49.451
How are people gonna do RollerBod at home?

06:51.119 --> 06:53.455
Are they gonna roller-skate
in front of their VCRs?

06:53.539 --> 06:55.040
No.

06:55.040 --> 06:57.251
I mean-- Wait.

06:57.251 --> 07:02.172
I mean, I don't know.

07:03.715 --> 07:07.678
Maybe we didn't,
like, 100% work out the details.

07:07.678 --> 07:13.225
But babe, I just need you to know,
like, I would do anything for you.

07:13.225 --> 07:15.185
Like, I would lay down my life.

07:15.269 --> 07:17.271
And what would that get us?

07:18.021 --> 07:22.109
I mean,
it's gotta be worth something, right?

07:22.985 --> 07:24.903
Like, how do you not get that?

07:26.947 --> 07:28.657
You're the one who doesn't get it.

07:46.675 --> 07:49.720
<i>Will you stop thinking of him,
you horny old ho?</i>

07:51.722 --> 07:53.599
<i>You've got a show to do. Clean it up.</i>

07:54.183 --> 07:56.351
- Hello, gorgeous!
- Hi.

07:57.311 --> 07:59.521
I just dropped the kids off with Danny.

07:59.605 --> 08:01.064
He's completely overwhelmed.

08:01.148 --> 08:03.400
Uh-huh, I'm so sorry to hear that.

08:04.818 --> 08:06.028
No, you're not.

08:07.237 --> 08:09.781
Okay. What do you think?

08:09.865 --> 08:11.116
Cute.

08:13.619 --> 08:15.495
What? What?

08:17.539 --> 08:18.665
<i>You can explain this.</i>

08:18.749 --> 08:21.502
I think... You know, I think Maya kicked me.

08:23.003 --> 08:24.213
No.

08:25.756 --> 08:26.840
That's a handprint.

08:26.924 --> 08:30.260
No, that's a man-sized handprint, Sheila.

08:32.179 --> 08:33.804
- Sheila?
- Yeah?

08:33.889 --> 08:35.057
What are you not telling me?

08:35.974 --> 08:37.601
<i>It's tempting, but dangerous.</i>

08:37.683 --> 08:40.187
Nothing. Nothing at all.

08:40.187 --> 08:41.438
I just...

08:42.563 --> 08:45.150
You know, Danny sometimes
just gets a little intense with me.

08:45.234 --> 08:48.195
<i>That's it. Always another family member
to throw under the bus.</i>

08:48.195 --> 08:49.530
That little shit.

08:50.113 --> 08:51.406
Sheila, I swear to God--

08:51.490 --> 08:53.617
No, it's not what you're thinking at all.

08:53.617 --> 08:58.747
We've just been having,
like, intense, you know...

08:59.289 --> 09:01.917
- Like hate sex?
- Yeah. I guess you could call it that.

09:01.917 --> 09:03.836
So, what are you doing? Like, bossy stuff?

09:03.836 --> 09:05.379
Light bondage? Heavy bondage?

09:05.379 --> 09:07.589
No. More, like, emotional?

09:08.757 --> 09:14.221
I know it's not healthy, but it's one way
for me to figure it all out, you know?

09:15.013 --> 09:16.306
It's not healthy,

09:17.558 --> 09:18.684
but that's super hot.

09:19.560 --> 09:21.520
Yeah, it's very, very hot.

09:23.063 --> 09:24.940
- I'm still leaving him.
- Okay.

09:24.940 --> 09:29.987
I just need a little more time,
more money. This is how I get it.

09:29.987 --> 09:31.238
- Boom.
- Is it really bad?

09:31.238 --> 09:32.781
Oh, my God. Don't even worry about it

09:32.865 --> 09:36.577
because I literally have the best cover-up
in my purse.

09:36.577 --> 09:41.999
And a card for a divorce lawyer.
Whenever you're ready. No rush.

09:41.999 --> 09:44.543
And I have
an amazing water-based lubricant.

09:44.543 --> 09:48.463
I swear, there will be zero friction.
But I think I left it in my evening bag.

09:48.547 --> 09:51.425
No, here it is. I already used that,
but you don't want to know that story.

09:52.634 --> 09:54.720
And then when the election
didn't go our way,

09:54.720 --> 09:57.222
that was really the beginning of the end.

09:57.306 --> 09:59.683
Although it was tough to see at the time,
you know?

09:59.683 --> 10:00.767
I do, yeah.

10:00.851 --> 10:03.395
We tried to keep things alive
with the think tank and the--

10:03.395 --> 10:06.106
We did have some good ideas for change.

10:06.190 --> 10:10.819
But he just couldn't handle
that I wanted to prioritize my family.

10:10.903 --> 10:13.322
And he moved on.

10:13.322 --> 10:17.242
Well, I happen to think
that what you're doing is very brave.

10:18.410 --> 10:21.538
David-- My David,
he never watched the kids. Never.

10:21.622 --> 10:23.582
Never packed a lunch. Never did pickup.

10:23.582 --> 10:25.918
- Look where that got him.
- Mexico with his secretary.

10:25.918 --> 10:27.544
Oh, I'm so sorry. I didn't know.

10:27.628 --> 10:28.962
No, please. I'm fine.

10:29.046 --> 10:31.048
Look at me. I'm, like, free.

10:31.048 --> 10:32.883
I'm completely free.

10:32.883 --> 10:34.760
Candice, what did I say about biting?

10:35.385 --> 10:37.513
I'm just glad that Leo and C--

10:37.513 --> 10:41.517
Well, both of them, really,
are here, seeing an involved father.

10:43.143 --> 10:47.022
Well, we're all about progress
in this house. Radical progress.

10:47.022 --> 10:49.358
Okay, Berkeley. It is Berkeley, right?

10:49.858 --> 10:52.694
- That's right, yeah.
- I may have heard a few things.

10:53.695 --> 10:55.781
Okay, can I just admit something to you?

10:55.781 --> 10:57.324
I would love that.

10:57.324 --> 11:00.536
I signed up for this committee
because I knew you would be on it.

11:01.620 --> 11:03.622
Nobody cares about anything
in this town anymore.

11:03.622 --> 11:05.290
Especially not that rich bitch, Greta.

11:05.374 --> 11:08.418
Ooh, I'm sorry.
I really try not to use the B-word.

11:08.502 --> 11:09.962
B all you want here.

11:11.004 --> 11:12.005
Just be yourself.

11:13.924 --> 11:16.176
I love the kids. I do. I really do.

11:16.260 --> 11:17.427
I just...

11:18.262 --> 11:22.683
You know, sometimes I just feel--
I don't know. Like--

11:22.683 --> 11:24.351
- Lonely?
- Angry.

11:25.352 --> 11:31.149
Like I have this, just overwhelming anger
that just has nowhere to go.

11:31.650 --> 11:33.193
Right. Angry.

11:35.988 --> 11:37.948
Have you ever been to a protest, Wanda?

11:38.448 --> 11:40.868
Next bottle. Knock 'em down. Win a prize.

11:40.868 --> 11:42.786
Be a better you. <i>Body By Sheila</i>.

11:43.453 --> 11:44.997
You don't have to be rude about it.

11:44.997 --> 11:46.164
Hey! Hey!

11:48.750 --> 11:49.751
I'm so sorry.

11:50.586 --> 11:52.963
- Thanks. All right, next up.
- Thank you.

12:00.137 --> 12:01.805
Everyone's reason is different.

12:02.514 --> 12:03.932
Let's add a knee.

12:05.851 --> 12:07.311
Maybe you wanna lose weight.

12:09.062 --> 12:10.731
That's a perfectly good reason.

12:12.482 --> 12:14.735
I'm here to learn what I'm capable of.

12:15.319 --> 12:16.528
Let's make it a kick.

12:18.906 --> 12:22.618
Not here in this workout.
Out there in that world.

12:23.285 --> 12:25.829
Let's add the arms. That's it.

12:26.830 --> 12:28.207
Keep it up.

12:29.041 --> 12:33.128
When you push yourself right here,
when you see how much you can change,

12:33.212 --> 12:36.924
you're gonna wanna make that change
out there that you've been putting off.

12:36.924 --> 12:38.175
You know what I mean?

12:40.219 --> 12:42.971
Don't you, ladies? Don't you?

12:44.973 --> 12:46.558
Yes, and twist!

12:47.601 --> 12:50.145
What about you, sir? In the hat.

12:51.021 --> 12:52.773
You seem to wanna look at boobs and butts.

12:53.732 --> 12:57.444
That's okay! Whatever it takes.
As long as you don't stay put.

12:57.528 --> 13:01.031
As long as you get up.
As long as you start moving.

13:01.615 --> 13:02.741
As long as you--

13:04.409 --> 13:06.954
Sorry. Sorry. One second.

13:07.496 --> 13:08.664
Sorry.

13:10.123 --> 13:12.751
<i>What the fuck is that? Cover. Cover.</i>

13:12.835 --> 13:15.170
Okay, keep it up. Keep it up.
You got this.

13:15.254 --> 13:18.340
With a slow it down. And walk. Two, three.

13:18.340 --> 13:24.137
And tap, and tap, and tap, and tap.

13:24.221 --> 13:25.722
Dad, is that you?

13:26.598 --> 13:29.434
- Ezekiel.
- They ran out of tickets.

13:31.395 --> 13:33.063
You must be Mr. Breem.

13:34.773 --> 13:36.733
This-- This is my friend, A-Alejandra.

13:37.651 --> 13:39.236
Nice to meet you. I'm Alejandra.

13:39.236 --> 13:41.905
Oops, he already said. Sorry.

13:43.156 --> 13:44.157
Alejandra.

13:44.241 --> 13:45.325
Yeah.

13:46.702 --> 13:48.036
Nice to meet you.

13:48.120 --> 13:50.706
Oh, yes. You speak Spanish. Zeke told me.

13:50.706 --> 13:51.874
Yes?

13:51.874 --> 13:53.500
Yeah.

13:53.584 --> 13:55.544
What else did he tell you about me?

13:58.881 --> 14:00.883
Why don't you get in line
for the Tilt-a-Whirl?

14:00.883 --> 14:02.134
I'll meet you over there.

14:03.218 --> 14:05.512
See? He's being cool about it.

14:08.473 --> 14:11.059
I met her in school. In class.

14:11.768 --> 14:13.395
She's, like, a really good student.

14:13.395 --> 14:15.939
And her family's really nice.

14:16.523 --> 14:17.733
You've met her family?

14:22.613 --> 14:24.781
How can we hate anti-Mormon bigotry

14:24.865 --> 14:27.701
when we're the exact same way
when it comes to Catholics?

14:27.701 --> 14:30.704
I mean, it just doesn't make any sense.

14:31.872 --> 14:33.665
Are you gonna tell Mom?

14:39.338 --> 14:41.089
She does seem like a nice girl.

14:43.050 --> 14:44.051
Yeah.

14:44.051 --> 14:48.472
The word development is the first lie.
This isn't development, it's destruction.

14:48.472 --> 14:50.057
Pure destruction.

14:50.557 --> 14:55.479
The kids-- That's my daughter,
right there, San Diego born and raised.

14:55.979 --> 14:57.397
You know, I ask myself every day,

14:57.481 --> 15:01.318
are these shores gonna be here for her
in five years? In ten? Twenty?

15:01.318 --> 15:03.237
Will they be here
for her daughter someday?

15:03.237 --> 15:05.989
Well, we came out today
to make sure that they are. Right?

15:06.073 --> 15:09.284
Stop the shop! Save our wave!

15:09.368 --> 15:11.620
Do you have a name for your group?

15:11.620 --> 15:16.625
We are the Environmental Youth...

15:17.125 --> 15:18.293
Enterprise.

15:18.377 --> 15:20.087
E-Y-E. Eye.

15:20.671 --> 15:23.465
'Cause we're watching.
Watching out for Mother Earth.

15:23.549 --> 15:25.592
Can you tell us your name again, sir?

15:26.510 --> 15:28.470
Yeah, it's Danny Rubin.

15:28.554 --> 15:30.222
Like the sandwich?

15:30.889 --> 15:34.101
No, not-- No. It's spelled R-U-B-I-N.

15:34.101 --> 15:36.687
- I actually ran for public office. Yeah.
- Very good.

15:36.687 --> 15:40.566
And is that your wife over there
with all the kids?

15:40.566 --> 15:43.694
No. No, I-- My-- She's not here.

15:43.694 --> 15:45.279
She's elsewhere.

15:45.904 --> 15:48.490
I do it every day. Or every other day.

15:48.574 --> 15:51.493
I like that I can, you know,
cheat a little since no one's watching.

15:51.577 --> 15:53.328
That's the beauty of working out at home.

15:53.412 --> 15:57.082
Have you thought of making a tape
for teens? Or elderly adults?

15:57.666 --> 15:59.084
Not yet, but I will.

15:59.960 --> 16:04.756
I've been getting hungrier since I started
exercising. Ravenous. Do you find that?

16:04.840 --> 16:06.383
<i>Course you do, but you control it.</i>

16:06.383 --> 16:08.218
I try to maintain a balanced diet.

16:08.302 --> 16:10.470
Three healthy meals a day,
two light snacks.

16:10.554 --> 16:13.098
What do you eat for breakfast?
Grapefruit? Cottage cheese?

16:13.182 --> 16:14.349
I like oatmeal.

16:14.433 --> 16:16.435
- <i>Nobody likes oatmeal.</i>
- What about lunch?

16:16.435 --> 16:19.438
Do you make something separate
for the kids' dinner or eat with them?

16:19.438 --> 16:20.564
<i>You starve yourself.</i>

16:20.564 --> 16:21.857
Do you wear insoles? Should I?

16:21.857 --> 16:23.317
Butter or margarine?

16:23.317 --> 16:25.068
<i>You watch every bite
that goes in your mouth.</i>

16:25.152 --> 16:26.361
Ice or heat?

16:26.445 --> 16:28.071
- Chocolate or carob?
- <i>You don't eat.</i>

16:28.155 --> 16:29.448
- Cheater.
- Liar.

16:29.448 --> 16:31.491
- Fraud.
- Boo.

16:32.409 --> 16:34.745
Oh. Hello.

16:37.122 --> 16:39.458
- I didn't see you there.
- Big crowd.

16:41.084 --> 16:43.170
Can I help you with something? Or...

16:45.130 --> 16:47.424
A lot of people want to meet
the lady on the tape, I guess.

16:50.260 --> 16:51.720
I watched it, you know.

16:52.846 --> 16:55.057
Wow. Thank you.

16:55.766 --> 16:57.100
I didn't buy it.

16:57.184 --> 16:58.602
I stole it, just like you.

17:02.564 --> 17:03.941
How's Tyler?

17:04.023 --> 17:06.818
He's great. Yeah, he's just so great.

17:06.902 --> 17:08.153
He's a doctor now.

17:08.819 --> 17:10.989
He went to doctor school,
and now he's a doctor.

17:13.575 --> 17:17.329
Well, it's... good to see you.
Thanks for stopping by and--

17:17.329 --> 17:19.790
So, how'd you do it?

17:19.790 --> 17:24.086
How'd you make it look so--
like it's all one take.

17:26.213 --> 17:27.297
It is one take.

17:27.381 --> 17:30.008
Ten sets of ski slices
with alternating knees?

17:30.509 --> 17:34.012
No fucking way.
You don't have it in you to go that hard.

17:34.096 --> 17:37.724
<i>She didn't just watch, she studied it.
Studied you.</i>

17:38.225 --> 17:41.103
Did you--
I mean, did you think I had it in me?

17:41.103 --> 17:43.063
Do you? Because--

17:44.898 --> 17:46.650
I mean, I barely even smoke anymore.

17:47.234 --> 17:49.278
<i>Holy shit. You got to her.</i>

17:49.778 --> 17:53.198
- You know, I could use you, Bunny.
- Like you haven't already.

17:53.282 --> 17:55.826
No, I could hire you as another teacher.

17:55.826 --> 17:57.286
A job. Money up-front.

17:57.286 --> 17:58.996
You want me to work for you?

17:59.788 --> 18:02.165
Shake my butt up there to sell your tape?

18:02.249 --> 18:04.418
I could use the help.

18:04.418 --> 18:08.088
And I don't think you could go
as hard as I do. I know you can.

18:08.172 --> 18:10.257
You're a great teacher. Best I ever had.

18:10.257 --> 18:12.384
Sheila! Hey!

18:12.885 --> 18:15.012
- Great sales today!
- Thank you.

18:15.012 --> 18:16.638
Numbers are ticking up.

18:16.722 --> 18:19.933
This must be one of your fans.
One of your Sheila-nators!

18:20.017 --> 18:22.394
If you wanna leave your name,
we can enter you in a raffle

18:22.394 --> 18:24.021
for a free class with Sheila.

18:24.021 --> 18:25.856
And then I can enter you up to my elbow.

18:27.441 --> 18:28.942
I'm not a fan of hers.

18:29.026 --> 18:30.903
- I'm the original her.
- No.

18:30.903 --> 18:32.279
She stole from me.

18:33.030 --> 18:34.573
- You stole from me.
- No, I didn't.

18:34.573 --> 18:36.658
- I'm gonna get security.
- It's okay.

18:36.742 --> 18:38.619
This tape you're selling?
All the moves are mine.

18:38.619 --> 18:41.246
No, this is my routine.
This is my routine.

18:41.330 --> 18:43.874
- You're a fucking thief!
- Hey. Hey! Honey!

18:44.541 --> 18:46.043
All right. This is not--

18:46.043 --> 18:48.629
- No. Absolutely not.
- You fucking-- You ruined my fucking life.

18:48.629 --> 18:50.589
Calm down. Okay.

18:51.089 --> 18:54.843
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
She's-- She's a troubled girl.

18:54.927 --> 18:57.095
- She's a very troubled girl.
- You okay?

18:57.179 --> 18:59.640
You know what?
I could really use some water or--

18:59.640 --> 19:01.558
Yeah, some water. You okay?

19:01.642 --> 19:04.520
Kevin, can you bring two waters, please?

19:04.520 --> 19:06.188
Three waters. Thanks, Kevin.

19:06.188 --> 19:08.607
...the shop! Save our wave!

19:08.607 --> 19:15.155
Stop the shop! Save our wave!

19:23.038 --> 19:25.040
Sorry to keep you waiting, folks.

19:25.040 --> 19:26.708
- Good to see you. Uh-huh.
- Bobby.

19:26.792 --> 19:28.293
- How are you?
- That's nice. Come on.

19:28.377 --> 19:29.628
- Dick, nice to see you.
- Yeah.

19:29.628 --> 19:32.297
Nice of you to show up.
We've been standing here for an hour.

19:32.381 --> 19:34.758
- It hasn't been an hour.
- Felt like an hour.

19:35.384 --> 19:37.386
- Let's just take the photo, shall we?
- Yeah, great.

19:37.386 --> 19:38.846
Where do you want us?

19:39.513 --> 19:43.725
We got a couple of uniforms standing by.
If we give the word they'll make arrests.

19:43.809 --> 19:44.935
Send a message.

19:44.935 --> 19:48.105
It's just some kids and a couple hippies.
Nothing to write home about.

19:48.105 --> 19:49.606
Tell that to the local news.

19:50.274 --> 19:54.319
You gave the impression this was
a clean deal, but this feels messy.

19:54.403 --> 19:56.780
- And we don't like the messy.
- She's the one who's messy.

19:56.864 --> 19:58.282
Did you see her fingernails?

19:58.282 --> 20:00.033
Oh, and she's high on speed.

20:01.076 --> 20:03.537
The deal is absolutely clean.

20:03.537 --> 20:06.331
I was inspired by her class,
but the routine is my own.

20:06.415 --> 20:08.375
<i>Piece of shit.
You stole from her, and you know it.</i>

20:08.375 --> 20:11.378
She's troubled.
Very talented, but troubled.

20:11.378 --> 20:13.046
- Poor thing.
- She drinks speed!

20:13.672 --> 20:17.593
Well, I hope you're right because
we'd love to stay in business with you.

20:18.594 --> 20:19.970
You're one of our favorites.

20:21.096 --> 20:23.056
My son tells me good things.

20:24.099 --> 20:25.392
And he tells me everything.

20:25.392 --> 20:28.770
<i>Of course, that lazy turd is a spy.</i>

20:29.730 --> 20:33.108
Understood. She won't be a problem.

20:36.570 --> 20:37.696
Can you just--

20:39.323 --> 20:41.783
- Thank you, Kev.
- Thanks, yeah. Thanks, Kev.

20:41.867 --> 20:43.243
Never got that water.

20:50.334 --> 20:51.627
Mama.

20:51.627 --> 20:53.545
- I'm sorry.
- Jesus Christ!

20:53.629 --> 20:56.340
This is Mr. Breem, Mama. He drove me home.

20:57.299 --> 20:58.509
I didn't mean to frighten you.

20:59.760 --> 21:03.472
What-- What do you mean he drove you home?

21:03.472 --> 21:04.973
What? Where's Daddy?

21:05.057 --> 21:08.185
Well, Danny was arrested.

21:09.436 --> 21:11.730
He and a group of children
were trespassing.

21:11.730 --> 21:14.733
Or, as he would call it, "protesting."

21:14.733 --> 21:17.528
Right. Okay. And is he okay?

21:18.153 --> 21:19.696
There was a friendly lady there,

21:19.780 --> 21:23.075
and she helped
get all the other kids home. Right?

21:23.575 --> 21:25.244
Very friendly lady.

21:26.620 --> 21:27.913
With your husband.

21:28.914 --> 21:30.082
Hey, you okay?

21:30.082 --> 21:31.166
- I'm fine.
- Yeah?

21:33.210 --> 21:35.212
Do you want to go get in your pajamas?

21:35.712 --> 21:36.713
It's not bedtime.

21:36.797 --> 21:38.715
I know,
but we could have a double dessert.

21:43.178 --> 21:44.388
I'll be right in. Go.

21:47.975 --> 21:51.061
- Are you hurt?
- No. No, I'm fine. I just--

21:53.397 --> 21:56.066
I'm just trying to find
our lawyer's number.

21:56.066 --> 21:57.818
But where are they holding him?

21:59.444 --> 22:01.280
Do you really have to do that right now?

22:02.114 --> 22:04.283
Couldn't you let him stay there
a minute or two?

22:06.118 --> 22:08.370
Wouldn't be the worst thing in the world,
would it?

22:10.497 --> 22:14.585
He's in a holding cell in Del Mar,
a block from the beach.

22:16.670 --> 22:18.213
It's certainly not Attica.

22:19.047 --> 22:20.883
You shouldn't be here in my home.

22:20.883 --> 22:23.719
This is-- You've crossed the line.

22:23.719 --> 22:26.138
He thinks he can stop me
from what I'm doing.

22:28.182 --> 22:29.766
He can't stop it.

22:32.519 --> 22:33.896
Not for a minute.

22:35.898 --> 22:38.483
This is wrong that you're here.
It's wrong.

22:38.567 --> 22:39.902
Apologize.

22:43.238 --> 22:44.281
For what?

22:45.866 --> 22:47.659
For the way you're talking to me.

22:50.829 --> 22:52.122
Are you crazy?

22:53.999 --> 22:55.292
Apologize.

23:02.174 --> 23:03.842
You smell like sweat.

23:04.801 --> 23:08.514
Well, I've been exercising for hours.

23:11.350 --> 23:12.392
I'm sorry.

23:17.022 --> 23:19.691
I gotta-- I have to get that. I--

23:19.775 --> 23:21.443
- Of course, you do.
- Yeah.

23:22.528 --> 23:23.529
I'm--

23:26.448 --> 23:27.533
Of course.

23:28.283 --> 23:29.826
<i>You've reached the Rubins.</i>

23:29.910 --> 23:32.704
<i>Please leave us a message after the tone,
and we will call you back.</i>

23:32.788 --> 23:34.081
<i>Peace and love.</i>

23:35.374 --> 23:37.501
<i>Hello there. It's Liz Norton.</i>

23:38.085 --> 23:42.214
<i>I'm calling for Sheila.
If you could give her a message.</i>

23:42.214 --> 23:44.007
<i>Or maybe she hears this.</i>

23:44.091 --> 23:46.969
<i>I'm not terribly familiar
with how these things work.</i>

23:46.969 --> 23:51.014
- I'm a free man. Okay.
- Yes. Yeah.

23:51.098 --> 23:52.558
Yeah. Okay.

23:54.643 --> 23:59.648
<i>This is not how I intended to tell you,
but I haven't been able to reach you.</i>

24:01.149 --> 24:04.319
<i>I know you're terribly busy,
but I had to let you know.</i>

24:06.530 --> 24:09.074
<i>Well, your father passed away last night.</i>

24:09.992 --> 24:12.536
<i>It was sudden but peaceful.</i>

24:13.662 --> 24:15.455
<i>A heart episode, they believe.</i>

24:15.539 --> 24:18.667
<i>There will be a service
this weekend at St. James.</i>

24:18.667 --> 24:22.337
<i>I can give you all of the details
if you'll just call us back.</i>

24:22.421 --> 24:26.383
Arrest me, don't arrest me.
I felt alive again out there, protesting.

24:26.383 --> 24:29.469
The news was there.
The fucking news was there.

24:29.553 --> 24:30.596
I don't know. I just--

24:33.515 --> 24:34.808
You all right?
