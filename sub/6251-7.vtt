The soil is lousy
with iron oxides.

groundwater, turned the calcium
in the bones green.

- It depends.

08:09.698 --> 08:11.609

was very strong.

compensate for his condition.

compensation for his condition,

correct or not,

08:43.107 --> 08:45.564

08:59.623 --> 09:01.534
Wrestling is popular
in many cultures.

09:01.625 --> 09:04.332
It was the supreme contest
in ancient Greek games.

09:04.420 --> 09:09.084
Well, those were mostly
beautiful boys wrestling around
all oiled up and naked.

09:09.174 --> 09:10.710
That could be our victim.

09:10.801 --> 09:12.962
The muscle development
appears consistent.

09:13.053 --> 09:15.760
The distinct curvature
of the femur is undeniable.

09:15.848 --> 09:17.759
Then it seems

So it was a leprechaun
after all.
Well, that’s him.

09:22.521 --> 09:25.888
But I’m fairly certain
that Iron Leprechaun
is not his actual name,

will be aware of someone else...

like him disappearing.

09:45.335 --> 09:47.371

09:47.463 --> 09:50.580
I could spend
the rest of my life analyzing
the contents of that sinkhole.

Yeah, let’s not do that.
Start with the coins.

09:53.802 --> 09:58.296
All right. Well, uh, Brennan
found a Chinese Panda
right beside the body.

09:58.390 --> 10:02.474
Now within three meters,
I found four Krugerrands,
a French Rooster franc,

10:02.561 --> 10:05.348
a gold Indian Head
and a Canadian Maple Leaf.

10:05.481 --> 10:08.188
Worth a lot?
Well,
the Rooster alone—

10:08.275 --> 10:12.018
Hey, thank you, Sandy—
is worth about 400 bucks.

10:12.154 --> 10:14.987
Are any of these coins
traceable?
No.

10:15.073 --> 10:16.779
They’re all common
gold coins.

10:16.867 --> 10:19.609
There’s a hefty market in it
for people who are afraid
the economy will crash,

10:19.703 --> 10:21.568
but it’s not like
they carry serial numbers.

10:21.705 --> 10:26.199
What about the gun?
It’s a .22—caliber
Ruger Mark III.

10:26.293 --> 10:30.002
Rusted beyond all belief.
It’s loaded and unfired.

10:30.088 --> 10:34.252
It could belong to our victim,
or it could’ve been tossed
in the sewer 20 years ago.

10:35.469 --> 10:37.710
Let me know if you find
something special.

10:40.390 --> 10:43.803
So you failed to execute
a simple plumbing repair.
Big whoop.

10:43.894 --> 10:46.180
I had to get one
of those “Dummy” books.

10:46.271 --> 10:49.763
This is delicious.
I mean, it was— it was great.
You’re— You’re a good cook.

10:49.900 --> 10:54.269
You say you forgot about your
rather distinctive belt buckle?
Yeah. Bones had to remind me.

10:54.363 --> 10:57.730
Well, none of these adjustments
strike me as being particularly
earth-shattering.

10:57.825 --> 11:00.783
Ah, you haven’t gotten to
the juicy bit yet, have you?

11:08.293 --> 11:13.788
Oh, I see. You’ve suddenly
become an indiscriminate
homicidal maniac.

11:13.882 --> 11:15.793
Well, that is a cause
for concern.

11:15.884 --> 11:19.217
What it means is that
I’m a lousy shot, and
I have to recertify next week.

11:19.304 --> 11:21.295
I don’t know
what you expect me
to do about it.

11:21.390 --> 11:24.803
The only time I’ve ever
fired a weapon, it reared up
and struck me on the forehead.

11:24.893 --> 11:27.009
I just need you
to help me fire my gun.

11:27.104 --> 11:29.060
Thatsounds
desperately phallic.

11:29.147 --> 11:30.978
Is this maybe
a sexual problem?

11:31.066 --> 11:33.227
Don’t say that. Don’t even
put that out in the air.

11:33.318 --> 11:35.400
It would explain
your reticence.

11:35.487 --> 11:38.945
And why haven’t you gone
to see the estimable
Dr. Sweets for help?

11:39.032 --> 11:41.819

22:37.565 --> 22:41.023
- A fry cook?
- We’re not cops. We’re
professional interrogators.

22:41.110 --> 22:43.852
- Nobody’s a fry cook.
- The cops are in there.

22:43.947 --> 22:47.030
Yes, in case you annoy us
and we want an arrest made.

22:47.158 --> 22:51.618
Any more cracks about fry cooks,
and ill have them come in here
to rough you up!

22:51.704 --> 22:57.199
Okay, okay. Uh, you and
Bryce DaFonte were cell mates
for, what, 16 months?

22:57.293 --> 23:01.161
Yeah. I’m sorry for Bryce.
I liked him.
Made the cell feel roomier.

23:01.256 --> 23:05.249
We have information that Bryce
ratted you out so he would
look good for the parole board.

23:05.343 --> 23:07.049
I never took that personally.

23:07.136 --> 23:10.048
Little guy like that,
you gotta hold him
to a different standard.

23:10.139 --> 23:12.095
You were released,
what, um, three months ago?

23:12.183 --> 23:14.970
Paid my debt to society.
Got a job.

23:15.061 --> 23:16.972
- Road construction.
- Yep.

23:17.063 --> 23:20.271
- Did you ever work
in the Cleveland Park area?
- Why?

23:20.358 --> 23:23.225
Because that’s where
your former cell mate
was discovered—

23:23.319 --> 23:25.401
20 feet
under the roadway.

23:25.488 --> 23:27.444
Well, I didn’t put him there.

23:27.532 --> 23:31.070
Hey, look, Bryce told them
where to find my pruno
and dope stash, okay?

23:31.160 --> 23:35.153
That’s— That’s small beans.
Three days in solitary.
I’m gonna kill him for that?

23:36.374 --> 23:38.706
All right, all right. Look.

23:38.793 --> 23:41.751
Me and Bryce cooked
that dodge up together, okay?

23:41.838 --> 23:44.796
There was no chance
I was getting out a day earlier
than my full sentence,

23:44.882 --> 23:46.793
due to a spitting incident
involving the warden.

23:46.884 --> 23:51.002
I figured, why not
do my cell mate a solid
and get him out?

23:51.097 --> 23:53.804
And believe me,
DaFonte wanted out.

23:53.891 --> 23:55.722
Well, everyone
in prison wants out.

23:55.810 --> 24:00.304
Nah, not like Bryce.
He was talking about escape.
He was highly motivated.

24:00.398 --> 24:02.104
So what was the big rush?

24:02.191 --> 24:03.852
What you think?

24:03.943 --> 24:08.437
- I think perhaps a crisis
of the heart and loins.
- Oh.

24:08.531 --> 24:10.692
He got a Dear John letter
from his lady love...

24:10.783 --> 24:14.196
saying that she was thinking
about calling it quits on him.

24:14.287 --> 24:18.155
The least I could do for my buddy.
Wasn’t nobody waiting on me
on the outside.

24:22.253 --> 24:27.122
So my psychic says that
Brennan and Booth are linked
in a very profound way.

24:27.216 --> 24:30.674
In order to eat that thing,
you’re gonna have to dislocate
yourjaw...

24:30.762 --> 24:32.218
like an articulated python.

24:32.347 --> 24:33.883
[ Chuckles ]
Yeah.

24:33.973 --> 24:35.884
Tell me, though,

24:35.975 --> 24:37.886
have you noticed
any behavioral changes
in Booth...

24:37.977 --> 24:40.468
since he woke up
from the coma?

24:40.563 --> 24:42.474
He’s not as happy-go-lucky
as he used to be.

24:42.565 --> 24:45.557
It’s like he’s... sort of sad.

24:45.652 --> 24:47.142
Mmm.

24:47.236 --> 24:50.444
Perhaps the brain tumor
forced him to confront
his own mortality.

24:50.531 --> 24:53.898
Booth confronted his mortality
plenty of times.

24:53.993 --> 24:57.827
I think that that dream he had
about him and Brennan
being married—

24:57.914 --> 25:00.701
I think that he sort of
misses that dream.

25:00.792 --> 25:04.876
It’s like he’s homesick
for that place and those people.

25:04.962 --> 25:07.544
You think Booth...

25:07.632 --> 25:11.295
fell in love with
Dr. Brennan during a dream.

25:11.386 --> 25:14.719
So do you. Right?

25:14.806 --> 25:16.717
Well, I’m a—
l’m a psychiatrist.

25:16.808 --> 25:19.265
I’m— I’m not comfortable
with answering.

25:19.352 --> 25:21.468
No, you’re a chef.

25:21.562 --> 25:25.054
I am. As usual, you—
you see the truth of things.

25:25.149 --> 25:28.232
Oh! Look, I’m sorry.
I’m really sorry.

25:28.319 --> 25:29.855
This is the most
ill-conceived,

25:29.946 --> 25:34.189
sapless, vomitous
gargoyle of gastronimity
I’ve ever encountered.

25:34.283 --> 25:36.194
It’s preposterous.
You can’t—

25:36.285 --> 25:40.449
You know, you’re really gonna
have to learn to enjoy things
the way that they are.

25:40.540 --> 25:42.326
Mmm?

25:42.417 --> 25:44.282
Well, perhaps you’re right.

25:47.505 --> 25:51.794
The remains were covered
with 150 years’ worth of rubble.

25:51.884 --> 25:53.420
That’s a word I loathe.

25:53.511 --> 25:55.422
[ Booth ] Half-naked
dwarf wrestler
gets killed...

25:55.513 --> 25:58.175
and his body gets dumped
into some old hole
in the ground?

25:58.266 --> 26:01.303
Most of what he was
buried in— and what I found
around the remains— was tile.

26:01.394 --> 26:06.104
Translucent, ceramic, vitreous—
dating back to the 19203.

26:06.190 --> 26:09.307
- What was that—
some kind of Turkish bath?
- No, a pedestrian underpass.

26:09.402 --> 26:11.893
Here.
It collapsed in the ’30s.

26:11.988 --> 26:15.321
They just threw
some rocks into it
and paved it over.

26:16.409 --> 26:18.274
Wait a second.
So what you’re saying is...

26:18.411 --> 26:22.575
you think the Ieprechaun’s body
was in that pedestrian underpass
when the sinkhole happened?

26:22.665 --> 26:27.284
Yeah. A guy his size, there
could’ve been a way through it,
especially with some digging.

26:27.378 --> 26:29.289
That would’ve stretched
from here underground...

26:29.380 --> 26:32.292
to approximately
the other side of the street...

26:32.383 --> 26:34.715
and then maybe
another 20 feet east.

26:36.846 --> 26:39.337
“Cash for gold.”

26:39.432 --> 26:42.390
[ Officer Na varro ]
Three months ago,
this place got robbed.

26:42.477 --> 26:46.595
No sign of forced entry
to the doors or windows.
Alarm was cut from the inside.

26:46.689 --> 26:49.101
Bad guys got off
with bags of gold coins.

26:49.192 --> 26:52.810
We think the robber
may have been the victim
in your sinkhole.

26:52.904 --> 26:55.941
Well, I’ll be damned.
The owners of this place
will be glad to hear that.

26:56.032 --> 26:58.398
Fraud unit suspected
it was an inside job.

26:58.493 --> 27:01.860
- How much they lose?
- Oh, 120 grand worth.

27:01.996 --> 27:04.829
I think I found
the point of ingress.
[ Navarro ] Whoa!

27:04.916 --> 27:08.625
You gotta be kidding.
Just thinking about it,
I can’t breathe.

27:08.711 --> 27:11.453
Angela’s sketch shows
the collapsed pedestrian walkway...

27:11.547 --> 27:13.879
comes five feet from this drain.

27:13.966 --> 27:17.129
The victim was small and strong.
He could’ve dug his way through.

27:17.220 --> 27:19.336
That’s gotta be, what,
16,18inches?

27:19.430 --> 27:23.548
Honestly, I can’t breathe.
I got anxiety thinking
about a guy down there.

27:23.643 --> 27:26.430
Bones, there’s no way
the victim could get
his shoulders through there.

27:26.521 --> 27:29.888
He-He could ’ve made it.
ll/lost/y naked,
in his Lycra shorts.

27:29.982 --> 27:33.270
We may even find a container
of lubricant down there.

27:33.361 --> 27:36.068
- Well, all we found
were eight gold coins.
- Oh, yeah.

27:36.155 --> 27:38.817
Classic “accomplice rip-off”
scenano.

27:38.908 --> 27:41.650
No honor between thieves.

27:41.744 --> 27:43.655
What, I’m not allowed
to chime in?

27:43.746 --> 27:46.453
I’m a law enforcement
professional.

27:51.629 --> 27:54.871
The only markings
we know for sure
came from before the sinkhole...

27:54.966 --> 27:59.801
are these three little nicks
on his ribs.

27:59.929 --> 28:01.965
Could he have been stabbed?
With what?

28:02.056 --> 28:03.796
The world’s dullest knife?

28:03.891 --> 28:06.678
Well, perhaps
something along the lines
of a very dull hatchet.

28:06.769 --> 28:09.681
To a little person,
a hatchet would be
the equivalent of an ax.

28:09.772 --> 28:13.014
Assuming the accomplice
was already lying in wait,

28:13.109 --> 28:16.146
surely he would’ve had
the aforethought to bring
a more suitable weapon.

28:16.279 --> 28:18.611
Like a gun.
Or a giant sword.

28:19.782 --> 28:22.239
Ora gun.

28:22.326 --> 28:26.740
But the killer
would’ve had to have been
an incredibly bad shot...

28:26.831 --> 28:31.666
to merely graze
his or her victim...

28:31.752 --> 28:35.290
three times
in such tight quarters.

28:35.381 --> 28:37.121
Hmm.

28:38.718 --> 28:40.379
Oh! Oh, I see!

28:40.511 --> 28:43.423
If he— If he was
reaching forward.
Or wrenched.

28:43.514 --> 28:48.508
Or if he was actually hanging
from his arm and the killer
shot down from this angle.

28:48.603 --> 28:51.811
One bullet, fired from above,
grazing these three ribs,

28:51.898 --> 28:54.310
deflecting, piercing the diaphragm.

28:54.400 --> 28:56.516
And, of course,
as an achondroplastic dwarf,

28:56.611 --> 29:00.479
his organs would be
more tightly jammed together
than an average person.

29:00.573 --> 29:02.109
This would be his liver.

29:02.199 --> 29:04.360
He’d have bled to death
in minutes.

29:04.452 --> 29:06.443
We found cause of death.

29:12.835 --> 29:16.874
Yeah, there’s
some collateral damage
to Booth’s brain here.

29:16.964 --> 29:19.376
That would result in
the memory lapses, yeah,

29:19.467 --> 29:22.334
but it doesn’t explain
any of his other symptoms.

29:22.470 --> 29:25.758
Ah, but I don’t think Booth
has brain damage.
Then what’s his problem?

29:25.848 --> 29:30.717
May I ask why you didn’t
publish your book
on Booth and Brennan?

29:30.811 --> 29:34.269
What, is there
a connection between my book
and Booth’s marksmanship?

29:34.357 --> 29:36.268
IbeHeve
you didn’t publish it...

29:36.359 --> 29:40.227
because you’re afraid
of how Brennan and Booth
would react to its conclusion.

29:41.864 --> 29:44.981
My book concludes
that Brennan and Booth
are in love with each other.

29:46.035 --> 29:48.572
It’s a scrummy conundrum,
isn’t it?

29:48.663 --> 29:53.157
I believe that, as a reaction
to the childhood traumas
of abuse and abandonment,

29:53.250 --> 29:56.788
Dr. Brennan utilizes her intellect
to armor herself...

29:56.879 --> 29:59.120
from intense levels of emotion
erlove.

29:59.215 --> 30:01.171
And Booth?

30:01.258 --> 30:04.591
Well, subconsciously, he’s
sensitive to her vulnerability.

30:04.679 --> 30:09.969
He knows that acting upon
his feelings for her would
amount to a kind of assault.

30:10.059 --> 30:12.550
I couldn’t agree
with you more.

30:12.645 --> 30:14.886
So, Booth
not shooting straight...

30:14.981 --> 30:18.644
is simply, what, a manifestation
of his phallic frustration?

30:18.734 --> 30:22.226
He quite literally can’t
bring his weapon to bear.

30:23.906 --> 30:27.148
Do I even have the right
to publish my book...

30:27.243 --> 30:30.201
and make public what these two
can’t even admit to themselves?

30:30.287 --> 30:32.278
Good Lord, don’t ask me.

30:32.415 --> 30:35.327
I’m just a chef,
not a psychiatrist.
[ Groans ]

30:35.418 --> 30:37.329
I gave up that game...

30:37.420 --> 30:40.583
precisely so I don’t have
to face that kind of dilemma.

30:42.883 --> 30:44.544
Great.

30:49.557 --> 30:53.425
We do know that Hodgins found
a .22 pistol near the body.
it was fully loaded.

30:53.561 --> 30:58.225
It hadn’t been discharged.
Yeah, I know that, Bones.
I do work for the FBI.

30:58.315 --> 31:01.682
So, has Gordon Gordon
helped you at all
with your shooting problem?

31:01.819 --> 31:04.481
He doesn’t see it as a problem.
Then maybe you don’t have one.

31:04.572 --> 31:08.611
Have you ever considered
the possibility that you might
simply be getting older?

31:08.701 --> 31:12.410
Men do tend to decline physically
past the age of 35.

31:12.496 --> 31:15.863
Remind me again how great
I feel after talking to you.

31:16.000 --> 31:19.367
Well, who else would
always tell you the truth?
It does make me feel better.

31:19.503 --> 31:22.791
It makes no rational sense,
but it does.
Mmm.

31:22.882 --> 31:24.747
Maybe I should start
packing heat again.

31:24.884 --> 31:27.250
Packing heat?
Yes. It’s a colloquialism.

31:27.344 --> 31:29.255
l-l’m quite a good shot.

31:29.346 --> 31:31.678
If the leprechaun was shot,
then where would the bullet be?

31:31.807 --> 31:36.221
I assume somewhere
in the six tons of crap
Hodgins hasn’t sifted through yet.

31:36.312 --> 31:38.724
Wait a second.
Did you just call
forensic evidence “crap”?

31:38.856 --> 31:41.188
It’s colloquial again.
What do you think?
Very nice. I like it.

31:41.317 --> 31:43.603
It shows
that you’re adapting.
Well, I’m working on it.

31:43.694 --> 31:46.936
And joshing around too.
[ Chuckles ]

31:47.031 --> 31:48.316
Yeah.

31:55.372 --> 31:57.203
I already admitted
that Bryce and I
had a thing.

31:57.291 --> 31:59.577
Hey, where’s that
hot FBI. agent guy?

31:59.668 --> 32:02.501
If I’m gonna be interrogated,
I want it to be from him.

32:02.588 --> 32:07.753
That sweet little pistol
you owned that went missing—
is this it?

32:07.843 --> 32:10.334
Is that the gun that was
used to kill Bryce?

32:10.429 --> 32:12.135
Uh, no, but it was nearby.

32:12.223 --> 32:15.135
Then,yeah.
That’s my pistol.

32:16.393 --> 32:18.304
He didn’t steal the gun
from you.

32:18.395 --> 32:20.602
You gave it to him because you
were worried about his safety.

32:20.689 --> 32:23.146
I’m not exactly
the worrying type.

32:23.234 --> 32:25.225
You wanna make out
a little bit?

32:25.319 --> 32:29.403
[ On Speaker]
People watching from behind
that mirror kinda turns me on.

32:29.490 --> 32:32.232
This— This persona
she’s projecting,

32:32.326 --> 32:34.237
this little person cougar—

32:34.328 --> 32:36.819
she’s either
masking emotional pain...

32:36.914 --> 32:38.450
or overcompensating
for guilt.

32:38.541 --> 32:40.122
Maybe you should
tell Sweets.

32:40.209 --> 32:42.791
Oh, believe me,
if a chef can figure it out,

32:42.878 --> 32:45.620
then a prodigy like Sweets
would’ve got there long before.

32:45.756 --> 32:49.465
[ Gidget Continues, indistinct]
Tell me.
[ Lowers Volume]

32:49.552 --> 32:53.170
What’s your theory
on why Agent Booth can
no longer shoot straight?

32:53.264 --> 32:55.175
He should practice more.

32:55.266 --> 32:58.303
B-But perhaps, in conjunction...

32:58.394 --> 33:01.431
with his using the wrong foot
to climb the stairs...

33:01.522 --> 33:03.308
and his wrong hand
to drink coffee,

33:03.399 --> 33:05.981
he’s closing the wrong eye
when he aims.

33:06.068 --> 33:09.276
Real marksmen
keep both eyes open
when they shoot.

33:09.363 --> 33:13.606
Oh. Well, that’s what I get
for using Ouig/ey Down Under
as a reference, isn’t it?

33:13.701 --> 33:16.943
So, Sweets told you about
the hands and the feet?

33:17.037 --> 33:20.780
Mmm. We’re consulting.
Patient confidentiality
is being maintained.

33:20.875 --> 33:24.538
And I won’t tell Booth that
you’ve been ratting him out
to the FBI. behind his back.

33:24.628 --> 33:26.664
“Ratting out”
is an accurate phrase,

33:26.755 --> 33:29.997
but somehow
it doesn’t seem true.

33:30.092 --> 33:34.631
Hmm. You’ve come
quite a long distance
since we last met...

33:34.722 --> 33:38.635
if you can now see a distinction
between accuracy and the truth.

33:38.726 --> 33:43.265
I’m trying to help Booth.
I can be objective about
his brain, and he can’t.

33:43.355 --> 33:46.847
Sometimes you have to help
people against their wishes.

I wouldn’t do to help him.

Yes.

33:55.993 --> 33:58.200
[Sweets]
Did you give Bryce the gun...

33:58.287 --> 34:00.949
because you knew
he was planning a robbery?

34:01.040 --> 34:03.952
All I knew is
Bryce told me he found a way
to make a ton of money fast.

34:04.084 --> 34:06.791
Who was in it with him?
I don’t know.

34:06.879 --> 34:12.169
I think the reason
you feel responsible is that if
you’d paid Bryce his fair share,

34:12.259 --> 34:14.170
he wouldn’t have
gotten himself killed.

34:14.261 --> 34:16.968
Bull’s-eye!
Well done.

34:18.182 --> 34:21.299
Bryce didn’t need money
to impress me.

34:21.435 --> 34:25.348
And it wasn’t me he was worried
about when he was in prison.
Who was it?

34:25.439 --> 34:27.976
All I know is that Bryce
broke it off with me.

34:28.067 --> 34:30.023
Said he had to get serious
with somebody else.

34:31.862 --> 34:34.478
Said I wasn’t
enough woman for him.

34:41.330 --> 34:44.242
What took you so long?
Don’t answer that, okay?
What did he get out of her?

34:44.333 --> 34:47.245
I have no idea,
but the two of them
are very excited.

34:47.378 --> 34:49.960
You wanna—
! wouldn’t dream of it.
Please.

34:50.047 --> 34:53.881
Okay, uh, murder victim
told Gidget that she wasn’t
enough woman for him.

34:53.968 --> 34:56.505
- So?
- So it suggests that,
while in jail,

34:56.595 --> 35:00.179
your victim was pining for
an average-sized woman.

35:00.266 --> 35:02.473
Vocabulary?
That is your evidence?

35:02.559 --> 35:04.470
We subpoenaed the victim’s
cell phone records.

35:04.561 --> 35:06.813
The only people
he ever talked to were
Gidget and his brother.

35:06.897 --> 35:09.274
The victim’s brother said
that they were estranged.

35:09.358 --> 35:14.648
And the victim’s brother’s wife
is an average-sized woman,
isn’t she?

35:14.780 --> 35:17.692

No, no.

35:30.170 --> 35:33.082
Why did you
bring me here?
We found Bryce right there.

35:33.173 --> 35:36.256
He was crawling
from all the way over there,

35:36.343 --> 35:37.958
lugging his own weight
in gold coins...

35:38.053 --> 35:40.669
through a tunnel probably
about— oh, about that wide.

35:40.764 --> 35:43.972
He got out.
On the other end,
he was shot and killed.

35:44.059 --> 35:47.301
Now, why is it that somebody
would do something like that?

35:47.396 --> 35:49.057
Greed? Bravery?

35:50.649 --> 35:53.857
He was doing it for you,
wasn’t he, Nicole?

35:56.864 --> 36:00.777
How long were you
and Bryce seeing each other
behind your husband’s back?

36:00.868 --> 36:03.860
Since always.

36:03.954 --> 36:05.694
Since high school.

36:07.541 --> 36:11.079
I wrote Bryce in prison, and
I told him that we had to stop.

36:12.546 --> 36:16.459
But when he got out on parole,
he begged me to choose him.

36:16.550 --> 36:19.462
Got it in his head
that to get me to himself...

36:19.553 --> 36:22.090
he had to be a better provider
than his brother.

36:24.099 --> 36:26.431
Are you gonna
tell Derek about us?

36:26.518 --> 36:27.849
No.

36:27.936 --> 36:30.143
No, I’m not gonna say
anything to him.

36:30.230 --> 36:33.063
But I will tell you
that if you’ve been in love
with another man for 10 years,

36:33.150 --> 36:35.266
your husband knows.

36:35.361 --> 36:39.821
What I need to know is,
who was helping Bryce out
with this burglary?

36:39.907 --> 36:41.522
I don’t know.

36:41.617 --> 36:44.529
I don’t know. Probably
somebody he met in prison.

36:44.620 --> 36:47.703
He said that he would buy me
anything that I ever wanted.

36:47.790 --> 36:51.123
If I knew Bryce was stealing,
I would’ve begged him to stop.

can’t have the woman
that he loves,

36:54.630 --> 36:56.586

36:56.673 --> 37:01.417
One brother,
he died for you right there.

played the same sport,

38:14.376 --> 38:16.492
Mr. DaFonte, please.
Your hand. Just like this.

38:21.341 --> 38:25.334
When your brother came out
of the tunnel, you reached out
and took his hand.

38:25.429 --> 38:29.638
He thought the two of you were
working together, but you knew
why he wanted the money.

grazing three ribs.

38:38.358 --> 38:41.600
You pushed him back into
