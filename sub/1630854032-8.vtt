WEBVTT

00:05.088 --> 00:07.590
I can't hold them off, Rick!
There's too many!

00:12.178 --> 00:15.932
Richard! Your fortress
is a salty waste of coral and clam.

00:16.015 --> 00:17.100
Relinquish it at once!

00:23.982 --> 00:27.444
-Submit, you continental cunt.
-Got a better idea.

00:28.695 --> 00:30.029
Oh shit, oh shit.

00:35.201 --> 00:36.911
-Happy?
-Of course I'm happy,

00:36.995 --> 00:39.622
you're acting like you won
but this is exactly what I wanted.

00:39.706 --> 00:41.875
I am Mister Nimbus!

00:42.625 --> 00:44.002
Whatever. Come on, Morty.

00:44.669 --> 00:47.964
-Man, that was intense.
-Yeah, nice work, buddy.

00:48.047 --> 00:49.883
Sorry I had to blow up your bunker.

00:49.966 --> 00:55.847
Not so fast, Sanchez.
It is I, Cookie Magneto.

00:55.930 --> 00:56.973
What the fuck.

00:57.056 --> 01:00.185
-I'm not engaging this guy.
-That's hardly up to you, Rick.

01:00.268 --> 01:03.188
I'm sorry, do you control things
that people agree are cookies?

01:03.271 --> 01:05.732
-Yes.
-Okay but cookies aren't a substance,

01:05.815 --> 01:08.485
-they're more of a name we-we give to
-To the things I control

01:08.568 --> 01:11.821
Do you control cookie ingredients,
because y'know that sounds dangerous,

01:11.905 --> 01:16.242
-y'know, everything has sugar in it.
-Fight me and find ou...

01:16.576 --> 01:18.912
-Jesus, Rick!
-I'm sorry, Morty, I know you're gonna say

01:18.995 --> 01:21.498
it's punching down but I can't fight
another one of these nineties

01:21.581 --> 01:23.875
style goofball super villains,
I'm not the fucking Tick,

01:23.958 --> 01:25.710
-I'm exhausted.
-Okay but

01:25.794 --> 01:28.630
if you really have a lot of these guys
gunning for you maybe you should look

01:28.713 --> 01:31.508
-into what you're doing to...
-Don't start that crap, Morty.

01:31.591 --> 01:33.760
I don't do anything for
these dipshits to seek me out

01:34.177 --> 01:36.137
I am Mr. Calypso.

01:36.554 --> 01:41.309
Face me, you ugly, drunk,
ugly piece of shit.

01:42.560 --> 01:43.937
Okay I might look into it.

02:17.554 --> 02:20.056
-Why don't you have a seat?
-Because this isn't a therapy session,

02:20.139 --> 02:22.225
I'm just asking you what
people in your racket

02:22.308 --> 02:24.727
say about handling
this particular situation.

02:24.811 --> 02:27.355
First we'd want you
to define the situation.

02:27.438 --> 02:30.024
I'm a walking target
for a neverending sea of angry nerds

02:30.108 --> 02:31.901
that think getting in a fight
with me is some kind of

02:32.277 --> 02:34.571
I don't know, platform?
I mean, look at this guy.

02:34.654 --> 02:36.239
He shows up and calls me an "ugly drunk."

02:36.322 --> 02:38.908
Because of course that's the angle
of attack that's gonna undo me, right.

02:39.242 --> 02:42.161
You don't shoot Batman
in his fucking Batman logo.

02:42.245 --> 02:44.497
And you think locking
this man in a chamber

02:44.581 --> 02:47.584
and milking him of cosmic fluid
will somehow resolve this?

02:47.667 --> 02:51.379
I think it's the best I can do to profit
from a situation and maybe set an example.

02:51.462 --> 02:55.091
But you've set this example many times
and it's not changing your situation.

02:55.174 --> 02:57.302
Yeah and now you're gonna
tell me to ignore them

02:57.385 --> 03:00.680
-but guess what, they want that too.
-And why would they want to be ignored?

03:00.763 --> 03:02.599
You really believe
if I let a guy like this

03:02.682 --> 03:04.893
do whatever he wants,
he gets bored and vanishes?

03:04.976 --> 03:07.604
Rick, would you be interested
in proving me wrong?

03:08.021 --> 03:09.814
-Yes.
-Then show me data.

03:09.898 --> 03:11.941
Ignore them for a week
and see what happens.

03:12.400 --> 03:13.943
You're on, bitch.

03:14.777 --> 03:16.029
Is that man dead?

03:16.821 --> 03:18.615
Is everything in here confidential?

03:18.698 --> 03:20.199
-Everything but murder.
-Then he's fine.

03:21.826 --> 03:23.536
I mean, I think it's pretty big, you know?

03:24.037 --> 03:25.288
Big step for the big cheese.

03:25.371 --> 03:27.999
-Yeah, Dad, I'm impressed.
-Can we not make it a big deal?

03:28.082 --> 03:29.500
It's worth celebrating, Rick.

03:29.584 --> 03:31.127
You accepted the concept of therapy

03:31.210 --> 03:33.713
without turning yourself into
a pickle or a housefly.

03:33.796 --> 03:36.925
Jerry, for fuck's sake, that was
a regular fly in her office that day.

03:37.008 --> 03:39.177
-What the hell?
-Rick!

03:39.260 --> 03:41.054
How â€˜bout a little piss?

03:41.137 --> 03:43.514
Rick, why is there a man shooting piss

03:43.598 --> 03:45.308
-on our front lawn?
-I'm sure he'll tell you.

03:45.391 --> 03:51.439
I am Pissmaster! Here to flush
the toilet that is Rick Sanchez.

03:52.023 --> 03:55.652
He's spraying my lavender bush.
My bees need that lavender.

03:55.735 --> 03:58.488
Remember five seconds ago when you
guys were stoked about me changing

03:58.571 --> 04:00.239
because it made you feel superior?

04:00.323 --> 04:03.368
Whole family's here.
Who's that redhead?

04:03.451 --> 04:05.578
Wouldn't mind spraying her
with a golden shower.

04:05.662 --> 04:07.121
-Oh my god, what?
-Hey!

04:07.205 --> 04:09.165
-Okay, that's it!
-Jerry, please think about this,

04:09.248 --> 04:10.959
if you fight this guy,
I'm either an asshole

04:11.042 --> 04:12.627
for not helping or an asshole for helping.

04:12.710 --> 04:16.547
My daughter just got spoken of in
porno terms and I'll respond how I choose.

04:16.631 --> 04:17.548
-Wait Dad, don't.
-Honey.

04:18.299 --> 04:20.593
-Hey.
-You want a piece of piss?

04:20.677 --> 04:24.180
If that's your stupid rude way
of saying I have to fight you I will.

04:24.263 --> 04:27.100
-Take your shot, pussy.
-Don't talk to me that way,

04:27.183 --> 04:28.267
-go away.
-Make me.

04:28.351 --> 04:29.978
Go away.

04:33.106 --> 04:34.023
Careful, honey!

04:44.158 --> 04:45.368
Just stay down.

04:45.451 --> 04:47.996
-I don't even know you.
-Yeah you don't know me.

04:48.079 --> 04:50.873
But I'm gonna know your whole ass
you son of a gun.

04:55.920 --> 04:58.006
-Hey, none of that. Come on.
-Break it up, guys.

05:04.178 --> 05:06.139
Come on, you dirty motherfucker.

05:11.811 --> 05:12.937
No! No!

05:18.151 --> 05:19.068
Stop!

05:21.195 --> 05:24.323
Uncle! Mercy! Mercy! Stop! I give up!

05:24.907 --> 05:27.618
-Apologize to my daughter.
-For what?

05:28.036 --> 05:29.412
You know for what!

05:29.495 --> 05:35.668
I'm sorry! I'm sorry I sexualized you!
It came out wrong!

05:36.711 --> 05:39.464
That's my dad. That's my fucking dad!

05:42.258 --> 05:44.135
Honey, I'm so proud of you.

05:45.344 --> 05:47.972
-Oh sorry.
-Thank you, Rick.

05:50.433 --> 05:52.810
Damn, hashtag FlamingoDad is everywhere!

05:52.894 --> 05:56.606
Buzzfeed made an odd numbered list
of other people's observations about you

05:56.689 --> 05:58.775
and you're getting a lot
of hand clap emojis

05:58.858 --> 06:00.818
on White Twitter's impression
of Black Twitter.

06:00.902 --> 06:04.280
Jezebel's offering a cash reward
for evidence that you're a bad person.

06:04.363 --> 06:07.325
-That is their highest honor!
-So this is what it's like to trend.

06:07.742 --> 06:08.701
Feels good.

06:08.785 --> 06:10.078
-Feels right.
-Just keep in mind now

06:10.161 --> 06:12.080
a bunch more assholes are gonna
know they can get a rise out of you.

06:13.414 --> 06:16.292
-Rick, let a dog have one day.
-I'm letting. I'm letting.

06:19.253 --> 06:20.379
Are those orbs?

06:20.922 --> 06:22.173
This is what I'm talking about.

06:22.256 --> 06:25.718
Some asshole saw that fight and believe
it not, they were jealous of Pissmaster.

06:29.180 --> 06:33.643
I am Blagnar the Eternal. We seek the
earthling who beat up Pissmaster.

06:33.726 --> 06:35.144
That's my dad, Jerry Smith!

06:35.228 --> 06:40.066
Jerry Smith. Our Galactic Orbship thirsts
for justice and those who deliver it.

06:40.149 --> 06:41.317
-Wait, what?
-Our great council

06:41.400 --> 06:45.988
would like to offer you this silver orb.
And with it, a place amongst us.

06:46.656 --> 06:48.658
-It's sticky.
-Yeah.

06:48.741 --> 06:51.202
That means it's found a pure heart
it wants to bond with.

06:51.285 --> 06:54.163
you guys saw my son-in-law on the
news, now he gets a sticky orb,

06:54.247 --> 06:56.082
what's the catch? We're not rubes.

06:56.165 --> 06:58.960
Yeah your power is well known
in our jurisdiction, Rick Sanchez,

06:59.043 --> 07:02.547
and it should come as no surprise
that our orbs are unsticky for you.

07:02.630 --> 07:06.342
Oh no, first I get banned from the
Next Door app, now this.

07:06.425 --> 07:08.886
I'd be honored to join your organization.

07:08.970 --> 07:13.141
So what do I do, rub the orb when I see
crime, or eat the orb like spinach?

07:13.224 --> 07:17.145
The orb is raw power.
Trust your heart, Jerry.

07:17.520 --> 07:18.729
It will know what to do.

07:24.610 --> 07:28.573
-Did you turn on the microwave?
-No? Maybe? I was trying to fly.

07:30.575 --> 07:32.076
-What?
-I mean, come on, Rick.

07:32.451 --> 07:35.872
-Orbs and goblets, this is your thing.
-Orbs and goblets.

07:35.955 --> 07:39.500
I'm just saying, you're the orb guy in
the family. Can you please help me?

07:39.584 --> 07:42.170
Jerry, I give you raw power,
you'll end up miserable like me.

07:42.253 --> 07:45.006
-Trust me, I'm helping by not helping.
-Seriously, Rick?

07:45.089 --> 07:48.384
What the eff, Grandpa! Some creep tried
to pee on my tits and you did nothing,

07:48.467 --> 07:51.220
now you're gonna sit there
and hold our dad back from being a hero?

07:51.304 --> 07:53.890
-Are you seriously that petty?
-Okay, you know what, fine!

07:54.265 --> 07:55.808
Here. Here's your goddamn suit.

07:55.892 --> 07:58.186
I hard-wired the orb's
infinite energy right into it.

07:58.853 --> 08:00.229
This shooty-thing looks cool.

08:00.313 --> 08:03.774
That "shooty thing" is a nuclear
disruptor that can blow up planets.

08:03.858 --> 08:05.276
-So tight.
-Kinda hot.

08:05.359 --> 08:09.780
Ok show me acts of evil
happening around the galaxy.

08:10.323 --> 08:15.369
Space Hitlers? "Space Hitlers
are convening on Zeplar Prime."

08:15.453 --> 08:17.747
My god, each one of them
is their own type of Hitler

08:17.830 --> 08:19.207
-Yeah, that's a problem.
-Oh shit, do that one.

08:19.790 --> 08:21.250
-You guys.
-That's my parents.

08:23.794 --> 08:27.548
Well family, looks like Jerry
Smith has his first orb mission.

08:27.924 --> 08:29.926
Lawn Flaming-ho!

08:31.469 --> 08:33.429
Just a reminder, you guys asked for this.

08:34.347 --> 08:38.309
Soon, our legion of Hitlers will bring
about a new galactic order.

08:38.684 --> 08:41.229
-A reich, if you will.
-Riddle Hitler me this.

08:41.604 --> 08:44.023
I'm sorry, are we just
letting in all Hitlers now?

08:44.774 --> 08:48.486
-Auf wiedersehen, bad guys!
-Exterminate him!

08:48.569 --> 08:51.197
Shit, oh Jesus. One at a time!

08:53.658 --> 08:54.784
Oh my god!

09:00.790 --> 09:02.708
Hope there weren't
other people on that planet.

09:03.209 --> 09:06.629
And there were no other people
on the planet. Only Hitlers.

09:06.712 --> 09:08.965
Each one ready to start
their own holocaust,

09:09.048 --> 09:12.718
meaning an estimated thirty billion
lives were saved by a single blast.

09:13.052 --> 09:16.931
And the galaxy owes it all to Jerry Smith.
Hashtag FlamingoDad.

09:17.431 --> 09:20.935
-You gotta be fucking kidding me.
-Up next, oh actually nothing.

09:21.018 --> 09:22.853
I guess we're just gonna
talk about Jerry Smith some more.

09:24.397 --> 09:29.026
I dunno, therapy is starting to feel
hopeless. I've got so many issues!

09:30.152 --> 09:32.154
-We need to talk.
-Hey. No.

09:32.613 --> 09:36.659
I will not speak with you if you refuse
to treat me and my patients with respect.

09:39.745 --> 09:44.250
Oh lord. I was a fly!
So unburdened, so free of shame!

09:44.333 --> 09:45.501
Welp, I'm officially cured!

09:46.002 --> 09:48.504
Here. Here's your data.
Hard proof that god hates me.

09:48.963 --> 09:50.965
I ignored a troll and Jerry
beat the guy's ass.

09:51.048 --> 09:53.968
Now he's got this orb and he's
using the power which I gave him

09:54.051 --> 09:56.887
to annihilate planets of Hitlers
and everyone's popping champagne.

09:57.305 --> 10:00.683
Rick, you came here because you wanted
things to change and they're changing.

10:00.766 --> 10:01.767
It's working.

10:01.851 --> 10:05.438
So if my bumbling moron of a son-in-law
beats up people, it's "working".

10:05.521 --> 10:07.398
But if I do it, it's a
cosmic abuse of power?

10:07.732 --> 10:09.066
Rick, listen to yourself.

10:09.150 --> 10:12.445
You're complaining about how you have
to be careful with your immense power.

10:12.528 --> 10:16.115
And that Hitlers are dead.
Everything you're describing is positive.

10:17.241 --> 10:20.494
Oh shit, not reacting.
That really is the kill move?

10:20.578 --> 10:23.164
I don't know if you need
to think about it in terms of murder,

10:23.247 --> 10:24.874
but yes just stay the course.

10:25.207 --> 10:28.210
-Okay, good talk.
-Well what you're describing is therapy

10:28.294 --> 10:29.962
and if you'd like to keep receiving it,

10:30.046 --> 10:32.381
start scheduling your visits
with Judy up front.

10:33.341 --> 10:35.593
Thank you, thank you Flamingo Fam.

10:35.968 --> 10:38.554
you know, when they asked me
if I wanted to be the first human

10:38.637 --> 10:42.391
to drive a Mitsubishi Space Lancer,
I thought well I don't know,

10:42.475 --> 10:45.936
I got this cool orb suit that goes
really fast. But you know what sold me?

10:47.855 --> 10:50.107
The Council said I could pick
my own bridge crew.

10:50.191 --> 10:52.735
Morty, Summer, Beth, what do you say?

10:52.818 --> 10:56.405
-What? Are you serious?
-Oh shit yeah, I love Mitsubishi!

10:56.489 --> 10:58.407
-Me too! I've heard of them!
-This is so exciting!

10:58.491 --> 10:59.992
Oh my god this is so cool!

11:00.076 --> 11:02.328
Alright gang, orbs away!

11:09.210 --> 11:13.130
O me o my, can it be?
A giant piece of shit I see?

11:16.467 --> 11:19.929
I am Mr. Stringbean!
No one resists my rhyming scheme!

11:20.012 --> 11:22.098
Hey douchebag, why don't you chill out?

11:22.807 --> 11:25.351
-Who's this asshole?
-I am Doctor Buckles!

11:25.434 --> 11:27.353
Here to tighten the belt on your opinions!

11:28.646 --> 11:30.439
You wanna see the Bean get mean?

11:34.193 --> 11:36.112
I'll be damned. I'm out.

11:37.405 --> 11:38.364
I'm out.

11:41.909 --> 11:42.868
I'm-I'm out.

11:43.369 --> 11:46.705
Oh my god, this Piss Guy
is getting wailed on.

11:47.498 --> 11:50.459
Look at him, he tried to crawl
under the car. What a loser.

11:50.543 --> 11:52.586
-Hey you watching the Pissmaster video?
-Yeah.

11:52.670 --> 11:55.548
He has to be the biggest
piece of shit in the galaxy, right?

11:55.965 --> 11:59.260
Without a doubt. Who could relate,
being that much of a piece of shit.

12:35.004 --> 12:35.921
Goddamnit.

12:37.506 --> 12:42.261
Fuck, shit, come on man.
Fuck, come on where is it? Shit, shit.

12:45.806 --> 12:46.724
Fuck!

12:48.809 --> 12:50.352
Come on Pissmaster, come on.

12:57.610 --> 12:58.527
Damn it.

13:06.118 --> 13:09.580
It's me. Please, please just open up

13:10.289 --> 13:14.168
Dad? Mom told me you weren't responding
to her calls and I'm worried, okay?

13:14.585 --> 13:16.962
I know I said terrible things
about you on my podcast,

13:17.046 --> 13:19.298
it's just, I've been
so frustrated with you.

13:19.798 --> 13:22.968
Look, if you were to ever do something
I'd never stop blaming myself.

13:23.302 --> 13:24.261
Just, please.

13:24.345 --> 13:26.680
-Please let me know you're okay.
-God damn it.

13:29.642 --> 13:32.561
-I'm okay honey, we're good.
-I thought something happened to you.

13:32.937 --> 13:35.064
I can tell you for sure.
If anything happens to me,

13:35.147 --> 13:37.650
it's 100% not on you, it's my own choice.

13:38.400 --> 13:40.736
You still sound like you're
gonna do something bad.

13:41.570 --> 13:43.405
Just promise you won't, okay?

13:44.365 --> 13:47.409
-Okay, yeah. Promise.
-Love you, Dad.

13:52.164 --> 13:53.082
Fuck.

14:01.674 --> 14:06.971
Well this is it. I'm killing myself
because of Jerry Smith. The Earth man.

14:07.388 --> 14:12.351
FlamingoDad. Seeing them all cheer
as I got my ass whipped made me realize.

14:12.768 --> 14:19.149
People just wanna see me fail. All I've
ever wanted to do is prove them wrong.

14:34.873 --> 14:35.791
Help!

14:38.669 --> 14:40.004
Wait! Who are you?

14:40.379 --> 14:44.341
Pissmaster. Make, make sure you
tell everybody Pissmaster saved you.

14:44.717 --> 14:47.386
Those were heat-seeking pissiles
by the way. Not just missiles.

14:47.469 --> 14:49.263
Oh, okay.

14:49.638 --> 14:50.639
Y'all ready for piss?

14:51.307 --> 14:54.768
Yo! Pissmaster! You saving that cat
to make people forget you suck?

14:54.852 --> 14:56.437
Nope, just saving it to save it.

14:56.770 --> 14:57.730
Okay, we got nothing.

15:04.361 --> 15:10.492
Piss! Pee! Urine! Number one!

15:11.452 --> 15:16.957
Pee pee! Piss! Pee pee!
-Look, it's Pissmaster!

15:20.044 --> 15:21.045
Dr. Wong, what's up?

15:21.378 --> 15:24.006
-Rick, you're late for your session.
-Cancel it. Bill me. I'm good.

15:24.590 --> 15:25.633
You're good?

15:25.716 --> 15:28.344
Yeah see, I put on the suit of my
enemy and I fucking love it.

15:28.427 --> 15:30.554
Now I'm gonna make a giant bomb,
plant it in a city,

15:30.638 --> 15:33.015
and then have his suit
auto-pilot the bomb into space.

15:33.098 --> 15:36.101
Boom. Everyone will think
Pissmaster sacrificed himself.

15:36.185 --> 15:40.147
He dies a hero, I get a win I'd otherwise
never get myself, nice wet bow on top.

15:40.522 --> 15:44.860
I'm tempted to second guess a lot of
that but I think you might be nailing it.

15:44.943 --> 15:47.488
-What?
-If it's free and fun, do it.

15:47.571 --> 15:48.614
It sounds healthy.

15:48.697 --> 15:51.575
That wasn't my goal but, good to know.
Shit, gotta go.

16:02.753 --> 16:04.797
No, exactly. And the slave planet thing,

16:04.880 --> 16:07.591
I hear he broke their chains
with pure urine, so.

16:10.094 --> 16:13.055
Hey guys, sorry I'm late,
lot of traffic on the orbway.

16:13.138 --> 16:17.643
Take a seat, Jerry. We were just
discussing Pissmaster's honorable rise.

16:17.726 --> 16:18.894
I mean, who cares, right?

16:19.228 --> 16:22.898
People are talking about him.
He's becoming likable. Good, even.

16:22.981 --> 16:25.776
-But he's Pissmaster.
-People change, Jerry.

16:25.859 --> 16:27.486
Everyone loves a comeback story.

16:27.569 --> 16:28.529
-Yes.
-I agree.

16:28.612 --> 16:33.867
All in favor of offering orbship
to Eugene Michael Piss, aka Pissmaster?

16:33.951 --> 16:34.993
-Orb-yes.
-Orb-yes.

16:35.077 --> 16:37.871
-All those opposed?
-Obviously orb-no.

16:37.955 --> 16:39.081
The orbship has spoken.

16:41.291 --> 16:43.794
You know what Jerry,
I think this is a good test for you.

16:44.211 --> 16:47.339
If you can't let go of your pettiness
enough to recruit Pissmaster,

16:47.673 --> 16:53.721
maybe you don't deserve your orb.
And Jerry. Don't come back without him.

16:54.471 --> 16:58.600
Absolute chaos! No one knows who
planted the bomb, but one thing is clear.

16:58.684 --> 17:04.106
Orphan Island, a city populated entirely
by orphans, now sits on the brink of doom.

17:04.189 --> 17:07.526
The Orphan Island bomb squad
is trying to dismantle it as we speak.

17:08.861 --> 17:12.740
I can't stress enough, I'm 8 years old,
I have no idea what I'm doing!

17:12.823 --> 17:14.825
Look! It's Pissmaster!

17:15.325 --> 17:18.412
Oh no, there's no time to dismantle it!
Come on, it's not safe here.

17:20.330 --> 17:21.832
Pisspop? Pisspop? Pisspop?

17:23.500 --> 17:25.836
-Pissmaster.
-Jerry, what are you doing here?

17:26.670 --> 17:30.799
Eugene Michael Piss. By decree of the
Andromeda strain, our great council

17:30.883 --> 17:33.135
presents you with this orb,
which you have to take.

17:33.218 --> 17:35.095
Fuck off, Jerry,
I'm in the middle of something.

17:35.179 --> 17:38.432
Excuse me? Hey, this is the
greatest honor you could ever be given.

17:38.515 --> 17:40.267
-I don't want it!
-Well you have to take it.

17:40.601 --> 17:42.144
Jesus Christ, get the fuck out of here!

17:44.646 --> 17:47.608
He's flying it into space!
He's gonna sacrifice himself!

17:49.359 --> 17:51.612
Get back here, you ungrateful shit!

17:51.695 --> 17:52.821
What is your problem?

17:52.905 --> 17:55.199
-You're screwing up my hero death!
-Good!

17:55.282 --> 17:58.869
FlamingoDad wants us to blow up?
When did he become a shitheel?

17:59.328 --> 18:00.662
Life comes at you fast.

18:00.746 --> 18:03.791
-Jesus, Dad! People are filming!
-Yeah, maybe dial it back?

18:12.049 --> 18:13.425
-Rick?
-PissSuit!

18:13.509 --> 18:15.344
-Auto-pilot the payload!
-Confirmed.

18:28.440 --> 18:29.983
That's my fucking dad.

18:35.697 --> 18:37.032
-Jerry?
-Dad, are you okay?

18:37.115 --> 18:39.743
Your father is the fucking Pissmaster!

18:40.118 --> 18:41.537
Grandpa? What the hell?

18:43.622 --> 18:46.542
Jerry, what is this?
People are saying you turned shitheel?

18:46.625 --> 18:50.295
Well apparently my father-in-law
is Pissmaster so why don't you ask him?

18:50.379 --> 18:54.842
What the? Rick Sanchez, thePissmaster?
Okay, this is not a good look.

18:55.384 --> 18:56.635
This family, man

18:56.718 --> 18:59.429
Look, I don't know what kinda
weird shit you two are pulling

18:59.513 --> 19:01.682
but it's completely unstickworthy.
We're done here.

19:02.140 --> 19:06.812
But I didn't know! I'm a good guy,
I made you all famous!

19:06.895 --> 19:08.188
I'm a thousand years old.

19:08.522 --> 19:12.234
You know how many "Flamingo Dads"
I've seen? Don't orb us.

19:14.987 --> 19:18.115
I don't get it.
You were Pissmaster the whole time?

19:18.198 --> 19:21.243
Obviously not, Jerry, I put the
suit on once Pissmaster kill...

19:22.411 --> 19:23.412
When, when you made him...

19:25.581 --> 19:27.624
Yeah. I've always been Pissmaster.

19:28.208 --> 19:31.378
But, that would mean you let my dad
beat you up just so he could, like,

19:31.962 --> 19:33.213
feel more confident?

19:34.006 --> 19:35.591
-Damn, Rick.
-Yeah that's amazing.

19:35.674 --> 19:40.429
Hold on, everyone's just accepting this?
Wait wasn't Pissmaster an alien?

19:40.512 --> 19:42.180
-He obviously avatar'd it.
-Probably a robot.

19:42.264 --> 19:43.640
But why? Why would Rick even

19:43.724 --> 19:45.392
-prop me up like that?
-Jesus, Jerry.

19:45.475 --> 19:48.937
Rick did something nice for once okay?
He's obviously trying to change.

19:51.940 --> 19:54.067
You are no longer worthy of Mitsubishi.

19:56.194 --> 19:59.531
Proud of you, Dad.
Or should I say: Pissmaster.

20:00.073 --> 20:01.825
Yeah Grandpa, sorry I yelled at you.

20:02.367 --> 20:04.286
And I guess I'm sorry for trying to

20:04.369 --> 20:06.914
stop you from killing yourself
with a nuclear bomb, I just...

20:07.831 --> 20:09.374
really
liked having an orb.

20:09.458 --> 20:11.793
Don't sweat it, Jer.
Piss under the bridge.

20:13.128 --> 20:14.880
Man, I guess the therapy worked, huh?

20:14.963 --> 20:17.507
Opening up, doing all that just
to make my dad feel good.

20:17.591 --> 20:18.634
That's pretty great of you, Rick.

20:19.009 --> 20:21.136
Yeah that's right, Morty. That's right.

20:21.720 --> 20:23.388
Wait Morty, you have to promise
not to tell anyone

20:23.472 --> 20:25.223
but your dad made Pissmaster kill himself.

20:25.307 --> 20:27.392
-Oh man, what?
-Yeah, I mean, I found him dead

20:27.476 --> 20:30.812
and I put on his suit but look at this,
he literally blames your dad.

20:31.396 --> 20:32.522
Holy shit.

20:33.148 --> 20:34.816
Wait, you kept the suicide note?

20:34.900 --> 20:36.526
-That's so messed up!
-I know, I mean,

20:36.610 --> 20:37.778
I had to tell someone, Morty,

20:37.861 --> 20:39.655
-I couldn't just sit on that.
-And you expect me to?

20:39.738 --> 20:40.864
Morty, no! What are you doing?

20:43.033 --> 20:46.203
-What the hell?! He killed himself?
-Jesus, Dad, you should've told us!

20:46.286 --> 20:48.705
-Especially if Jerry murdered him!
-Wait, don't say that,

20:48.789 --> 20:50.582
-I didn't murder!
-Hey, I thought it was pretty cool

20:50.666 --> 20:52.709
-that I withheld that information.
-But you didn't withhold it!

20:52.793 --> 20:54.836
-You're walking around with the note!
-Yeah Grandpa, you gotta like,

20:54.920 --> 20:56.588
keep it in your heart
as a great sacrifice,

20:56.672 --> 20:59.007
-that's the cool move.
-I mean, how am I the bad guy?

20:59.091 --> 21:00.175
He sprayed piss on us!
You all cheered me on!

21:00.259 --> 21:02.135
-You all cheered me on!
-Don't drag us into this.

21:02.219 --> 21:03.845
-A man is dead, Dad.
-Again, wasn't gonna say it,

21:03.929 --> 21:05.180
-but I told you this would happen.
-Get off your high horse.

21:05.263 --> 21:06.890
-Dr. Wong would be so proud.
-Go ahead and boo,

21:06.974 --> 21:10.018
-I was breathing piss, you think I care?
-Is this what it's like to trend?

21:10.102 --> 21:13.814
This is a nightmare, I should've
just let him pee on my daughter!

21:14.314 --> 21:15.232
What the hell, Dad?

21:47.431 --> 21:52.185
how about Jack Miller, aka CarJack?
He lifted a car off a stranger.

21:52.269 --> 21:54.021
-Next.
-Orb-no.

21:54.104 --> 21:55.981
We're fresh off a dad and a piss guy.

21:56.064 --> 21:58.275
Maybe we add someone
that's already powerful?

21:58.358 --> 22:00.402
We have to be realistic about
who we can get.

22:00.736 --> 22:03.155
-I have a pitch.
-We're not gonna add Scarlett Johansson.

22:03.613 --> 22:08.118
Next up: Mr. Nimbus. Lord of the oceans.

22:08.201 --> 22:09.786
I hear he controls the police.

22:09.870 --> 22:11.288
-The police?
-Orb-yes.

22:11.371 --> 22:15.250
Guys, I already checked, his reps say
he's really busy right now.

22:15.333 --> 22:17.586
-Everyone says that.
-And we're not busy?
