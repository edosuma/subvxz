01:16.332 --> 01:17.734
SHREDDER!

01:18.092 --> 01:22.523
HOW LONG MUST I PUT UP WITH
YOUR BLASTED INCOMPETENCE?

01:23.287 --> 01:26.316
OH, THAT'S IT, KRANG. BLAME
THIS POWER SHORTAGE ON ME.

01:26.816 --> 01:28.641
WELL, I JUST DID.

01:29.481 --> 01:31.250
AND PUT OUT
THAT CANDLE.

01:31.680 --> 01:33.059
IT'S HOT ENOUGH IN HERE.

01:33.827 --> 01:34.924
AS YOU WISH.

01:42.889 --> 01:44.992
STOP! CUT IT OUT!

01:48.341 --> 01:50.577
I'LL REMEMBER THIS,
SHREDDER,

01:51.213 --> 01:53.462
WITH EVERY CELL
OF MY CORTEX.

01:54.757 --> 01:57.030
IF WE DON'T
GET OUR POWER BACK,

01:57.266 --> 01:59.060
THIS COULD BE
THE END OF US.

01:59.872 --> 02:02.353
LET'S YOU AND ME
WATCH TV.

02:08.044 --> 02:10.384
YOU NUMSKULLS!
SHUT THAT OFF.

02:10.866 --> 02:12.180
NO. WAIT.

02:12.712 --> 02:14.237
TURN UP
THE SOUND.

02:14.581 --> 02:16.740
<i>AND SO, OUR CITY
IS PLAYING HOST</i>

02:17.006 --> 02:19.652
<i>TO THE NAVY'S LARGEST
NUCLEAR-POWERED SUBMARINE.</i>

02:19.962 --> 02:23.412
<i>THIS REMARKABLE CRAFT CAN
STAY UNDERWATER INDEFINITELY</i>

02:23.630 --> 02:26.149
<i>THANKS TO ITS VAST SUPPLY
OF NUCLEAR ENERGY.</i>

02:27.783 --> 02:28.701
HO HO! THAT'S IT.

02:28.980 --> 02:32.631
NUCLEAR ENERGY,
OODLES OF IT.

02:32.896 --> 02:36.345
THAT'S HOW WE'LL REPLENISH
THE TECHNODROME'S POWER.

02:36.999 --> 02:39.589
YOU MEAN DRAIN IT
FROM THE SUBMARINE?

02:40.088 --> 02:45.392
PRECISELY. THEN
NOTHING CAN STOP US

02:45.392 --> 02:46.785
FROM DRILLING
UP TO THE EARTH.

02:46.785 --> 02:48.813
NOTHING
EXCEPT THE TURTLES.

02:49.166 --> 02:51.662
HO HO! NEVER FEAR.

02:52.317 --> 02:53.542
I HAVE A SCHEME

02:53.542 --> 02:56.144
TO HANDLE THOSE
WRETCHED REPTILES.

02:59.578 --> 03:01.928
HURRY UP, IRMA, WE'VE GOT
TO GET BACK TO CHANNEL 6.

03:02.368 --> 03:04.213
AW, DO WE
HAVE TO, APRIL?

03:09.780 --> 03:12.036
I STILL HAVEN'T MET
ONE SINGLE SAILOR.

03:12.604 --> 03:13.931
HOW CAN YOU
SAY THAT?

03:13.931 --> 03:16.175
YOU WERE JUST TALKING
TO A WHOLE FLEET OF THEM.

03:18.089 --> 03:20.148
<i>I SAID
A SINGLE SAILOR.</i>

03:20.444 --> 03:22.133
ALL OF THEM ARE MARRIED.

03:22.994 --> 03:24.547
BURNE WILL
BLOW A GASKET

03:24.547 --> 03:25.865
IF I'M LATE
FILING THIS STORY.

03:25.865 --> 03:27.482
NOW, COME ON.
LET'S MOVE IT.

03:30.241 --> 03:32.696
NOW FOR
OPERATION BARNACLE.

03:43.675 --> 03:45.219
AHA! SUCCESS.

03:56.141 --> 03:57.242
NOW, SHREDDER,

03:57.632 --> 03:59.926
START DRAINING
THE SUBMARINE'S POWER

04:00.145 --> 04:01.814
INTO OUR STORAGE BATTERY.

04:12.474 --> 04:15.500
IT WORKED!
WE HAVE ENERGY.

04:16.853 --> 04:18.053
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

04:18.288 --> 04:19.243
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

04:19.723 --> 04:22.060
I DON'T KNOW, SIR. WE
SEEM TO BE LOSING POWER.

04:22.421 --> 04:24.870
SOMETHING IS DRAINING
ALL OUR ENERGY.

04:25.262 --> 04:26.809
NOW WE'RE LOSING
THE LIGHTS.

04:27.194 --> 04:28.837
SOUND GENERAL QUARTERS.

04:29.146 --> 04:29.989
AYE, AYE, CAPTAIN.

04:35.782 --> 04:39.815
SO, LIKE, WHAT'S TAKING SO
LONG TO FIX THE BOOB TUBE, DUDE?

04:40.033 --> 04:42.298
THESE THINGS
TAKE TIME, FELLAS.

04:43.359 --> 04:44.418
SAVED BY THE BEEP.

04:45.993 --> 04:47.089
YEAH, APRIL.

04:47.089 --> 04:48.522
HELLO, FELLAS.
WANT TO COME OVER

04:48.522 --> 04:50.798
AND WATCH A MOVIE
CLASSIC WITH IRMA AND ME?

04:51.302 --> 04:54.201
TUBULOSO! WE'RE
PRACTICALLY THERE.

04:54.432 --> 05:00.940
EXCELLENT. SOON WE'LL HAVE
STORED UP ENOUGH NUCLEAR POWER

05:01.140 --> 05:03.169
TO BREAK THROUGH
TO THE SURFA

05:04.623 --> 05:06.166
AND THIS WILL MAKE SURE

05:06.397 --> 05:09.648
THOSE MEDDLESOME TURTLES
DON'T INTERFERE.

05:10.625 --> 05:12.342
THEY LIVE
IN A SEWER.

05:12.719 --> 05:14.852
THAT SMELL WON'T
FRIGHTEN THEM AWAY.

05:15.323 --> 05:18.183
THIS POTION
ISN'T TO FRIGHTEN THEM.

05:18.183 --> 05:20.563
IT'LL MAKE THEM
FALL IN LOVE.

05:20.990 --> 05:22.810
LOVE?

05:23.182 --> 05:25.354
YES!
HEAD OVER FLIPPERS.

05:25.619 --> 05:27.333
WITH THE VERY
FIRST FEMALE

05:27.569 --> 05:29.409
THEY LAY
THEIR EYES ON.

05:29.678 --> 05:31.878
AND JUST HOW DOES
THAT HELP US?

05:32.233 --> 05:35.777
THEY'LL BE SO
SMITTEN WITH JEALOUSY,

05:36.056 --> 05:38.524
THEY'LL BE TOO BUSY
FIGHTING EACH OTHER

05:38.801 --> 05:40.702
TO FIGHT AGAINST US.

05:41.607 --> 05:44.915
OH, KRANG! THAT'S THE
MOST DEVIOUS, SINISTER IDEA

05:44.915 --> 05:46.576
YOU'VE EVER
COME UP WITH.

05:46.901 --> 05:48.074
I LIKE IT.

05:51.465 --> 05:53.996
OK, THIS
IS THE PLACE.

05:54.772 --> 05:56.977
ALL WE GOT TO DO
IS SNEAK IN

05:56.977 --> 06:00.224
AND POUR THIS LOVE
GUNK ON THE PIZZAS.

06:01.189 --> 06:02.590
NOW, LET'S
GET GOING.

06:06.160 --> 06:08.207
MICHELANGELO, WHY
ARE YOU STOPPING?

06:08.471 --> 06:10.545
I FIGURED I'D
PICK UP SOME PIZZA.

06:11.389 --> 06:13.275
I HATE TO GO
VISITING EMPTY-HANDED.

06:14.148 --> 06:15.541
OR EMPTY-STOMACHED.

06:17.113 --> 06:18.783
WELL,
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

06:19.413 --> 06:20.715
THOSE GREEN WIMPS

06:20.918 --> 06:23.576
ARE BUYING THE PIZZAS
RIGHT NOW, BOSS.

06:23.931 --> 06:27.282
EXCELLENT. I WISH
I COULD BE THERE

06:27.489 --> 06:29.109
WHEN THEY TAKE
THEIR FIRST BITE...

06:29.828 --> 06:32.244
AND WHEN THEY SEE
THEIR FIRST FEMALE.

06:33.819 --> 06:36.706
I THOUGHT THAT PIZZA WAS
SUPPOSED TO BE FOR APRIL AND IRMA?

06:37.392 --> 06:39.514
YOU KNOW WOMEN, THEY'RE
ALWAYS ON A DIET.

06:40.360 --> 06:42.247
TRUST ME.
THEY'LL THANK US.

06:43.305 --> 06:45.680
UGH. DOESN'T IT TASTE
KIND OF STRANGE?

06:46.020 --> 06:47.021
FACE IT, BUD.

06:47.223 --> 06:50.080
PEANUT BUTTER AND CLAMS
IS AN ACQUIRED TASTE.

06:50.641 --> 06:52.353
WHAT ABOUT YOU,
DONATELLO?

06:52.634 --> 06:55.036
NO, THANKS.
I'M DRIVING.

06:56.072 --> 06:57.941
LAST STOP.
APRIL'S PLACE.

06:59.700 --> 07:01.685
OHH. I'M FEELING
KIND OF WEIRD.

07:02.259 --> 07:03.802
OH, ME, TOO.

07:03.802 --> 07:05.631
LIKE TOTALLY BIZARRO.

07:05.971 --> 07:07.409
SAME HERE.

07:07.676 --> 07:09.299
MAYBE WE HAD
TOO MUCH PIZZA.

07:09.582 --> 07:10.496
HI, GUYS.

07:16.306 --> 07:17.153
WHERE'S APRIL?

07:17.648 --> 07:20.349
BURNE SENT HER OVER TO COVER
A STORY AT THE SUBMARINE BASE.

07:20.601 --> 07:22.359
SOMETHING FISHY IS
GOING ON THERE.

07:22.661 --> 07:25.638
I'VE GOT TO GET DOWN TO THE
OFFICE AND COVER FOR HER.

07:26.386 --> 07:28.837
WAIT! MY DARLING!
COME BACK!

07:30.238 --> 07:31.789
MAYBE WE OUGHT TO GO
DOWN TO THE PIER

07:32.016 --> 07:33.112
AND SEE WHAT'S UP.

07:33.112 --> 07:34.464
UH, FELLAS?

07:34.674 --> 07:37.984
NO WAY, JOSE! I'VE GOT
TO BUY IRMA SOME FLOWERS.

07:38.396 --> 07:40.611
CHEAPSKATE.
I'M GETTING HER FURS.

07:40.970 --> 07:42.005
YOU BOTH LOSE.

07:42.345 --> 07:44.981
I'M BUYING HER
DIAMONDS.

07:45.321 --> 07:47.071
NOW, WHAT'S GOTTEN
INTO THEM?

07:51.110 --> 07:51.851
FOR ME?

07:52.953 --> 07:54.876
AH! YOU GOT
TO BE KIDDING.

07:55.634 --> 07:57.349
EH, YOU'RE IRMA,
AIN'T YOU?

07:57.631 --> 07:59.040
EH, THEN THEY'RE
FOR YOU.

08:08.084 --> 08:10.440
"FROM YOUR HANG-TEN
HONEYBUNCH."

08:10.814 --> 08:13.483
OH, PLEASE, YOU GOTTA
TELL ME WHO THEY'RE FROM.

08:13.829 --> 08:16.789
THREE DIFFERENT GUYS ALL
WEARING SAILOR SUITS.

08:17.262 --> 08:19.551
THREE DIFFERENT SAILORS?

08:19.831 --> 08:21.439
I'VE HIT
THE NAVAL JACKPOT.

08:26.744 --> 08:29.008
COME IN, TURTLES.
WHERE ARE YOU?

08:29.261 --> 08:30.678
THIS IS
AN EMERGENCY.

08:30.678 --> 08:32.548
APRIL, WHERE ARE YOU
CALLING FROM?

08:32.842 --> 08:34.404
THE NUCLEAR
SUB STATION.

08:34.636 --> 08:36.431
THE ENTIRE CREW
HAS DESERTED,

08:36.745 --> 08:37.741
EVEN THE CAPTAIN.

08:38.005 --> 08:39.616
DO YOU THINK SHREDDER
MIGHT BE INVOLVED?

08:39.909 --> 08:41.015
I'D BET ON IT.

08:41.376 --> 08:42.659
WE'D BETTER
GET THERE QUICK.

08:42.890 --> 08:44.121
GET SERIOUS,
DUDE.

08:44.654 --> 08:46.217
IRMA'S MY GIRL,
I TELL YA.

08:46.733 --> 08:47.648
THE HECK SHE IS.

08:47.856 --> 08:48.770
SHE'S MINE!

08:48.770 --> 08:51.264
IRMA BELONGS TO ME.

08:52.272 --> 08:53.954
WHAT AM I SAYING?

09:01.319 --> 09:04.954
I WANT BOTH YOU BOZOS TO
STAY AWAY FROM MY GIRL.

09:05.453 --> 09:06.448
YOUR GIRL?

09:06.796 --> 09:09.102
IRMA BELONGS TO ME.

09:10.489 --> 09:12.361
THE HECK SHE DOES.
SHE'S MINE.

09:18.697 --> 09:21.112
STOP! WHAT'S
THIS ABOUT?

09:21.535 --> 09:23.068
THEY'RE IN LOVE,
MASTER.

09:23.397 --> 09:24.420
THAT IS GOOD.

09:24.703 --> 09:26.656
BUT WITH
THE SAME WOMAN.

09:26.970 --> 09:28.423
THAT IS BAD,

09:28.634 --> 09:30.553
ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY
SEEM TO HAVE FORGOTTEN

09:30.785 --> 09:32.079
THEY ARE TURTLES.

09:32.846 --> 09:34.813
I DON'T KNOW HOW, BUT
I HAVE THIS FEELING

09:34.813 --> 09:37.669
THAT SHREDDER ENGINEERED
THIS ENTIRE THING.

09:38.136 --> 09:40.384
SHREDDER INSPIRING LOVE?

09:41.221 --> 09:43.068
THAT WOULD BE
MOST UNUSUAL

09:43.295 --> 09:45.028
FOR A MAN WHO
SPECIALIZES IN HATE.

09:51.972 --> 09:52.955
ANOTHER PACKAGE
FOR IRMA.

09:53.701 --> 09:55.279
WHAT IS IT
THIS TIME?

09:55.575 --> 09:57.406
I DON'T
OPEN THEM, LADY.

09:57.406 --> 09:58.678
I JUST SCHLEP 'EM.

09:58.964 --> 10:00.135
IT MUST BE
ANOTHER GIFT

10:00.135 --> 10:02.536
FROM THOSE SEAGOING
SWEETHEARTS OF MINE.

10:03.670 --> 10:06.868
OH! HOW ADORABLE.

10:06.868 --> 10:07.951
IT'S A PUPPY...

10:08.414 --> 10:09.900
WITH A NOTE
IN ITS MOUTH.

10:10.222 --> 10:15.121
"MY FEELINGS FOR YOU ARE
MORE THAN PUPPY LOVE."

10:19.478 --> 10:21.673
OH, YOU'RE FROM
A SAILOR, ALL RIGHT.

10:24.418 --> 10:28.211
SOON THE TECHNODROME
WILL BE FULLY REPOWERED

10:28.449 --> 10:31.674
AND WHEN IT IS,
WE SHALL STRIKE.

10:33.107 --> 10:34.651
AND THE BEAUTIFUL PART IS

10:34.651 --> 10:38.184
THOSE TURTLES WILL BE
POWERLESS TO STOP US.

10:38.552 --> 10:40.816
YES! THAT LOVE POTION

10:41.049 --> 10:43.764
SHOULD BE HAVING
ITS FULL EFFECT BY NOW.

10:44.105 --> 10:45.792
AND WITH
THE TURTLES DIVIDED,

10:46.072 --> 10:47.978
IT'S TIME TO CONQUER.

10:51.515 --> 10:53.451
MASTER SPLINTER,
COME QUICKLY.

10:56.229 --> 10:57.639
WHAT IS IT,
DONATELLO?

10:57.948 --> 11:01.094
I ANALYZED SOME CRUMBS FROM
THAT PIZZA THE OTHER GUYS SHARED,

11:01.312 --> 11:03.731
AND IT WAS LACED
WITH A LOVE POTION.

11:04.967 --> 11:06.103
HMM. THAT WOULD EXPLAIN

11:06.103 --> 11:08.227
THEIR SUDDEN
INFATUATION WITH IRMA.

11:09.052 --> 11:12.846
IT DOES INDEED SOUND LIKE
ANOTHER OF SHREDDER'S EVIL PLOTS.

11:13.092 --> 11:15.700
I'VE GOT TO COME UP WITH
AN ANTIDOTE AND PRONTO.

11:15.950 --> 11:17.538
I WARN YOU, MY SON.

11:17.917 --> 11:22.110
UNTYING THE HEARTSTRINGS OF
LOVE IS NOT AN EASY CHORE.

11:25.658 --> 11:30.065
BOY, TRAVELING ALWAYS
GIVES ME AN APPETITE.

11:30.598 --> 11:32.483
LUCKY THING
I SWIPED A SNACK

11:32.483 --> 11:34.214
FROM THAT
PIZZA STORE.

11:36.654 --> 11:39.665
HEY, MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T
OUGHT TO BE EATING THAT.

11:39.957 --> 11:43.964
IT'S GOT THAT LOVE-POTION
JUNK ALL OVER IT.

11:44.185 --> 11:47.617
HEY, NOTHING'S GOING
TO HAPPEN TO THIS RHINO.

11:50.380 --> 11:53.732
YOU KNOW, THESE LANDINGS
ARE GETTING A LOT SMOOTHER.

11:54.325 --> 11:55.185
OK, WE'RE HERE.

11:55.667 --> 11:57.724
NOW IT'S
TURTLE-TRASHING TIME.

12:00.909 --> 12:02.544
ROCK STEADY AND BEBOP!

12:03.310 --> 12:04.514
HEY, LOOK.

12:04.807 --> 12:06.616
IT'S THAT APRIL BABE.

12:07.132 --> 12:11.423
APRIL
-- THE PERFECT NAME FOR A JUNE WEDDING.

12:11.688 --> 12:14.228
COME TO ME,
MY PRECIOUS.

12:14.494 --> 12:16.355
NO WAY, HORN HEAD.

12:18.175 --> 12:19.314
GOT YOU,

12:19.722 --> 12:21.235
YOU GORGEOUS
CREATURE.

12:22.345 --> 12:24.031
LOOK WHO'S CALLING
WHO A CREATURE.

12:24.978 --> 12:27.554
I NEED SOME TURTLE HELP.

12:27.925 --> 12:29.297
OH, NO.

12:29.704 --> 12:30.908
NOW WHAT?

12:35.507 --> 12:39.364
HMM. I CAN'T MAKE UP MY MIND
WHICH WEDDING DRESS TO ORDER,

12:39.625 --> 12:41.736
THIS ONE
OR...THIS ONE.

12:43.229 --> 12:45.917
COME BACK HERE
WITH THOSE LEDGERS.

12:46.146 --> 12:48.086
YOU HEARD HIM,
YOU MANGY MUTT.

12:52.155 --> 12:53.480
HEY, CUT THAT OUT!

12:54.242 --> 12:55.138
WOULD YOU--

12:56.850 --> 12:59.208
OH, YOU CUTE
LITTLE PUPPYKINS.

13:01.061 --> 13:02.841
DID THOSE NASTY MEN
SCARE YOU?

13:03.276 --> 13:06.681
FIRST I'M CALLING
THE DOG CATCHER,

13:06.884 --> 13:09.143
THEN I'M CALLING
MY LAWYER.

13:09.423 --> 13:12.324
VERNON, YOU'D BETTER BE
NICE TO ME,

13:12.531 --> 13:14.338
OR I WON'T INVITE YOU
TO MY WEDDING.

13:14.570 --> 13:17.550
AND YOU'D BETTER DO SOME
WORK AROUND HERE, YOUNG LADY,

13:17.550 --> 13:19.065
OR YOU'RE HISTORY.

13:21.699 --> 13:23.480
WHERE ARE YOU
TAKING ME?

13:23.788 --> 13:26.755
INTO THIS ABANDONED SUB,
MY DARLING,

13:26.966 --> 13:29.012
WHERE WE
CAN BE ALONE.

13:29.276 --> 13:31.773
I KEEP TELLING YOU
YOU'RE NOT MY TYPE.

13:32.024 --> 13:33.916
I GO FOR
HUMAN BEINGS.

13:35.657 --> 13:38.172
MAKE YOURSELF COMFY,
LITTLE BUTTERCUP.

13:38.418 --> 13:40.586
WE'RE GONNA BE HERE
FOR A WHILE.

13:42.975 --> 13:44.472
OH! NOW I GET IT.

13:44.724 --> 13:47.935
WE'RE GONNA WAIT UNTIL THE
TURTLES COME TO RESCUE HER,

13:48.142 --> 13:51.390
AND THEN WE'RE GONNA
TRASH THEM, RIGHT?

13:53.043 --> 13:54.490
WRONG, HOG BREATH.

13:54.751 --> 13:59.416
THIS SUB'S GOING TO BE
OUR PERSONAL LOVE BOAT.

13:59.669 --> 14:03.768
ME AND HER IS GONNA SAIL AWAY
ON OCEANS O'LOVE.

14:10.892 --> 14:12.437
LET ME GO,
YOU DISGUSTING CREEP.

14:12.925 --> 14:15.246
YOU'LL SEE.
ONCE WE'RE MARRIED,

14:15.464 --> 14:17.219
YOU'LL LEARN TO LOVE ME.

14:17.589 --> 14:18.834
I WOULDN'T MARRY YOU

14:18.834 --> 14:20.896
IF YOU WERE
THE LAST MUTANT ON EARTH.

14:21.471 --> 14:23.502
I'M PUTTING YOU
IN CHARGE

14:23.746 --> 14:25.778
OF THE WEDDING
ARRANGEMENTS.

14:25.993 --> 14:28.115
NOW, GO SWIPE A RING
AND KIDNAP A PREACHER.

14:29.165 --> 14:30.256
HA HA! SURE THING.

14:30.890 --> 14:33.170
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY
TO REACH THE TURTLES.

14:33.390 --> 14:34.686
IT'S A BIG SACRIFICE.

14:35.134 --> 14:39.086
OH, ROCK STEADY,
MY DARLING.

14:39.456 --> 14:42.701
HUH? YOU MEAN ME?

14:43.099 --> 14:47.381
WHO ELSE WOULD I BE TALKING TO,
YOU HANDSOME HUNK OF HORN NOSE?

14:47.760 --> 14:50.599
WHAT IS IT, MY SWEET?

14:50.923 --> 14:52.611
IF WE'RE GOING
TO BE MARRIED,

14:52.815 --> 14:54.152
I NEED
TO FRESHEN UP A BIT.

14:56.402 --> 14:57.979
YOU SMELL OK TO ME.

14:58.492 --> 15:01.035
BUT A BRIDE NEEDS HER
LIPSTICK AND MAKEUP.

15:01.299 --> 15:03.901
AND I DROPPED MY COMPACT
BACK ON THE PIER.

15:04.311 --> 15:05.578
NO SWEAT, HONEY BUN.

15:05.869 --> 15:07.241
I'LL GET IT
FOR YOU.

15:07.743 --> 15:09.818
LIPSTICK AND MAKEUP.
LIPSTICK AND MAKEUP.

15:10.035 --> 15:11.084
LIPSTICK AND MAKEUP.

15:11.084 --> 15:12.686
IF THAT IMBECILE
FINDS OUT

15:12.889 --> 15:14.202
MY COMPACT IS REALLY
MY TURTLECOM,

15:14.431 --> 15:16.556
I'M IN BIG TROUBLE.

15:17.600 --> 15:19.850
HERE IT IS, HONEY BUN.

15:20.281 --> 15:22.122
THANK YOU,
LOVE DOVE.

15:22.376 --> 15:24.683
NOW, IF A GIRL COULD
HAVE SOME PRIVACY...

15:25.304 --> 15:27.931
HEY, WHATEVER
SUGAR LIPS WANTS,

15:27.931 --> 15:29.097
SUGAR LIPS GETS.

15:31.108 --> 15:33.032
TURTLES, THIS
IS SUGAR LIPS--

15:33.481 --> 15:35.087
ER, I MEAN APRIL.

15:35.400 --> 15:36.636
COME IN, TURTLES!

15:38.349 --> 15:39.921
APRIL, WHERE ARE YOU?

15:40.347 --> 15:42.931
ROCK STEADY'S HOLDING ME
PRISONER ABOARD THE SUBMARINE.

15:43.170 --> 15:45.865
KRANG AND SHREDDER ARE DRAINING
OFF ALL THE NUCLEAR POWER.

15:46.162 --> 15:48.831
SO, THOSE CREEPS
WERE BEHIND THIS.

15:49.052 --> 15:51.781
WORST OF ALL,
ROCK STEADY'S BEEN FED

15:52.065 --> 15:53.456
SOME SORT
OF LOVE POTION

15:53.456 --> 15:54.992
AND HE WANTS
TO MARRY ME!

15:55.290 --> 15:57.020
I'VE JUST FINISHED
MIXING AN ANTIDOTE.

15:57.020 --> 15:59.126
WE'LL BE RIGHT THERE.
DON'T GO AWAY.

15:59.609 --> 16:01.279
FAT CHANCE.

16:03.996 --> 16:05.184
AH, FINISHED.

16:05.584 --> 16:07.878
REALLY, DONATELLO.
EVERY MOMENT COUNTS.

16:08.142 --> 16:10.335
THIS IS NO TIME
TO THINK ABOUT PIZZAS.

16:10.592 --> 16:11.981
IT'S NOT FOR ME, MASTER.

16:11.981 --> 16:14.540
IT'S FOR THAT LOVE-STRUCK
TRIO IN THE NEXT ROOM.

16:14.980 --> 16:16.834
I FINALLY WORKED OUT
THE ANTIDOTE.

16:17.315 --> 16:18.789
PRAY IT WORKS, MY SON.

16:19.002 --> 16:21.512
THE FATE OF APRIL,
YOUR BROTHER TURTLES,

16:21.769 --> 16:25.320
AND THE ENTIRE WORLD
RESTS ON ITS SUCCESS,

16:25.818 --> 16:27.880
BUT DON'T FEEL YOU'RE
UNDER ANY PRESSURE.

16:30.863 --> 16:31.581
LOOK, FELLAS.

16:31.581 --> 16:33.326
IT'S YOUR FAVORITE
PIZZA TOPPING--

16:33.622 --> 16:34.908
CHOCOLATE CHILI.

16:35.947 --> 16:38.226
FORGET IT.
I'M TOO IN LOVE TO EAT.

16:38.646 --> 16:39.688
SAME HERE.

16:40.062 --> 16:40.905
DITTO.

16:41.998 --> 16:43.323
AW, IT'S NO USE,
MASTER.

16:43.777 --> 16:45.774
PERHAPS IF YOU USED
A DIFFERENT APPROACH.

16:46.866 --> 16:47.711
WHAT A PITY.

16:47.944 --> 16:51.252
AFTER ALL THE TROUBLE IRMA
WENT TO IN PREPARING IT.

16:51.484 --> 16:52.923
IRMA?
IRMA? IRMA?

16:55.054 --> 16:56.365
LET ME HAVE IT.

16:56.365 --> 16:57.399
NO. ME!

16:57.399 --> 16:59.547
STAND BACK!
IT'S MINE!

17:00.217 --> 17:01.426
QUICK THINKING,
MASTER.

17:02.589 --> 17:05.521
OH! I JUST HAD THE
CRAZIEST NIGHTMARE.

17:05.835 --> 17:08.758
I DREAMT I WAS
IN LOVE WITH IRMA.

17:09.146 --> 17:12.339
MONDO WEIRD.

17:12.671 --> 17:15.694
LIKE, WHAT'S GOING
DOWN, BOY GENIUS?

17:16.069 --> 17:17.020
I'LL EXPLAIN LATER.

17:17.020 --> 17:19.300
RIGHT NOW, WE'VE GOT TO
GET TO THE SUBMARINE BASE.

17:23.087 --> 17:24.482
THERE'S THE SUBMARINE.

17:24.742 --> 17:26.351
AND APRIL'S ABOARD IT.

17:26.661 --> 17:27.944
YOU GUYS TAKE
THE DRY ROAD.

17:28.145 --> 17:29.815
AND WE'LL TAKE
THE WET ROAD.

17:30.638 --> 17:31.732
COWABUNGA!

17:37.583 --> 17:41.515
THE NUCLEAR ENERGY
HAS BEEN TOTALLY DRAINED.

17:41.515 --> 17:44.252
WE NOW HAVE FULL POWER.

17:44.721 --> 17:47.674
WHAT? IT'S THOSE
BLASTED TURTLES.

17:48.063 --> 17:49.563
NEVER FEAR.

17:49.852 --> 17:52.287
THE FOOT SOLDIERS
WILL TAKE CARE OF THEM.

17:55.034 --> 17:57.392
FOOT SOLDIERS
AT 5:00.

17:57.860 --> 17:59.312
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

17:59.587 --> 18:01.335
WE'RE ONLY
OUTNUMBERED 2-1.

18:09.768 --> 18:11.277
CHARGE!

18:17.189 --> 18:17.732
YEAH!

18:17.732 --> 18:20.510
ALONG WITH ROCK
STEADY AND BEBOP.

18:21.054 --> 18:22.692
WE'VE BEEN LOOKING
IN THE WRONG PLACE.

18:23.130 --> 18:25.537
THEY'RE GETTING AWAY
IN THAT LIFE RAFT.

18:25.537 --> 18:28.027
YOU WON'T GET
AWAY WITH THIS!

18:28.027 --> 18:29.358
IT'S THE TURTLES.

18:29.667 --> 18:31.396
DON'T SWEAT, MY PET.

18:31.724 --> 18:34.955
I WON'T LET THEM
INTERRUPT OUR WEDDING PLANS.

18:35.423 --> 18:38.829
BEBOP, GIVE THEM A LITTLE
TASTE OF TORPEDO JUICE.

18:39.044 --> 18:41.476
AYE, AYE, SKIPPER.

18:46.939 --> 18:49.483
BYE-BYE,
TURTLES.

18:51.215 --> 18:53.179
TORPEDO APPROACHING,
DEAD AHEAD.

18:54.458 --> 18:57.142
DID YOU HAVE
TO USE THE "D" WORD?

18:57.142 --> 18:58.595
I HOPE IT MISSES.

18:58.811 --> 18:59.873
NO WAY.

18:59.873 --> 19:01.405
IT'S RADIO CONTROLLED.

19:01.405 --> 19:02.702
SEE?

19:05.474 --> 19:07.846
CHILDRENS
AND MUTANTS FIRST!

19:11.180 --> 19:14.573
WAIT FOR ME,
MY HAIRY HERO.

19:19.825 --> 19:21.353
OOH! WHAT HAPPENED?

19:21.633 --> 19:23.820
I FEEL
AWFUL STRANGE.

19:24.661 --> 19:25.316
HELP!

19:25.526 --> 19:26.801
SOMEBODY, HELP!

19:27.788 --> 19:28.950
CHILL OUT, APRIL.

19:29.348 --> 19:30.763
AM I GLAD
TO SEE YOU.

19:35.343 --> 19:36.089
POOR APRIL.

19:36.307 --> 19:38.149
I HATE TO LOVE THEM
AND LEAVE THEM.

19:39.787 --> 19:42.924
THOSE WRETCHED REPTILES
HAVE RUINED EVERYTHING.

19:43.472 --> 19:44.994
WRONG AS USUAL.

19:47.711 --> 19:50.479
WE STILL HAVE ALL
THE SUBMARINE'S ENERGY

19:50.479 --> 19:52.266
STORED IN OUR BATTERY.

19:52.691 --> 19:57.754
I ASSURE YOU WE HAVE
THE UPPER HAND.

20:12.751 --> 20:13.904
SO, KRANG.

20:14.168 --> 20:17.524
ANOTHER BRILLIANT IDEA
OF YOURS DOWN THE DRAIN.

20:17.833 --> 20:19.347
DON'T LOOK AT ME.

20:19.648 --> 20:22.890
BLAME THOSE
MUTANT MORONS OF YOURS.

20:23.248 --> 20:24.936
ROCK STEADY,
BEBOP!

20:25.230 --> 20:26.555
MARK MY WORDS.

20:26.778 --> 20:31.472
NEETER NEETER!

20:31.764 --> 20:33.574
YOU GOT TO CATCH US FIRST.

20:38.584 --> 20:41.764
SORRY YOU HAD TO LET THOSE TWO
GOONS ESCAPE BECAUSE OF ME.

20:42.188 --> 20:45.466
IF I KNOW THEM, THEY'LL
BE BACK AGAIN SOON ENOUGH.

20:45.964 --> 20:47.711
APRIL!

20:48.911 --> 20:51.534
HI. I'VE BEEN LOOKING
ALL OVER FOR YOU.

20:51.841 --> 20:55.414
YOU'RE GOING TO BE THE
MAID OF HONOR AT MY WEDDING.

20:55.647 --> 20:57.036
YOUR WEDDING?

20:57.681 --> 20:58.970
WHO ARE YOU
GOING TO MARRY?

20:59.330 --> 21:03.466
MY THREE SAILORS
YOURSHOWS UP FIRST.

21:03.780 --> 21:06.461
THREE SAILORS?

21:06.773 --> 21:08.377
YOU GOT A PROBLEM WITH THAT?

21:08.705 --> 21:10.552
NO, BUT YOU
MIGHT HAVE ONE.

21:10.764 --> 21:12.730
I'M "YOUR SECRET LOVE."

21:13.014 --> 21:16.136
I'M "YOUR
DEVOTED ADMIRER."

21:16.479 --> 21:19.880
AND I'M "YOUR
HANG-TEN HONEYBUNCH."

21:20.343 --> 21:25.576
YOU? A--A TRIO
OF TURTLES?

21:29.552 --> 21:31.951
BELIEVE ME, FELLAS.
IT'S BETTER THIS WAY.

21:32.386 --> 21:36.414
LIKE THEY SAY, THE COURSE OF
TRUE LOVE NEVER RUNS SMOOTHLY.

21:36.683 --> 21:40.921
YEAH. IN OUR CASE,
IT JUST RUNS.
