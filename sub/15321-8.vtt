00:01.210 --> 00:03.371
Seattle Police Department.
Central dispatch.

00:03.379 --> 00:04.414
This is Detective Sarah Linden.

00:04.422 --> 00:06.538
I've got a code 1013,
officer down.

00:06.549 --> 00:08.289
Repeat...
My partner is down.

00:08.301 --> 00:10.542
The location is the Wapi
Eagle Indian reservation.

00:10.553 --> 00:11.633
Exact address unknown.

00:11.637 --> 00:14.379
I need a search team
organized immediately.

00:14.390 --> 00:16.051
King County search and rescue,
coast guard,

00:16.058 --> 00:17.093
all available tactical teams.

00:17.101 --> 00:18.432
Order's got to come
from watch commander.

00:18.436 --> 00:20.552
Well, then, run it up
the chain of command!

00:20.563 --> 00:21.348
Yes, ma'am.

00:21.355 --> 00:23.641
And call me on this number
when it's done.

00:25.026 --> 00:27.642
Mom? What happened?

00:38.414 --> 00:40.075
Holder's going to be fine.

00:40.082 --> 00:42.209
That's
why you have to stay here.

00:42.210 --> 00:44.872
I'm going to find him,
and he's going to be... fine.

00:46.547 --> 00:49.630
I don't want to stay here.
Why can't I go to Regi's?

00:50.009 --> 00:51.374
Because you can't.

00:51.385 --> 00:54.092
There's no time for that, Jack.
You'll be safe here at Holder's.

00:54.096 --> 00:55.927
Are you even listening to me?

00:55.932 --> 00:57.797
I don't want to stay here.

00:57.808 --> 01:00.971
We were fine here
last night, remember?

01:04.398 --> 01:06.730
I promise,
nothing's gonna happen.

01:06.734 --> 01:08.725
What about you?

01:08.736 --> 01:10.397
I don't want you to go.

01:10.404 --> 01:12.315
Let the other cops
do their job.

01:18.120 --> 01:19.405
Linden.

01:19.413 --> 01:20.448
Detective Linden,

01:20.456 --> 01:22.947
authorization for your
search party was denied.

01:22.959 --> 01:24.699
What do you mean?
There's an officer down.

01:24.877 --> 01:26.117
Who the hell denied it?

01:26.128 --> 01:29.495
Lieutenant Carlson.
He called it off.

01:46.440 --> 01:47.976
The meaning of a closed door
is lost on you.

01:47.984 --> 01:48.814
Make the call. Now.

01:48.818 --> 01:50.479
Because of the Larsen reward,
I've got cops

01:50.486 --> 01:52.192
that should be in the field
playing operator.

01:52.196 --> 01:54.187
I don't give a shit.
My partner's out there alone.

01:54.198 --> 01:55.278
He needs us.

01:55.283 --> 01:57.274
You'll do anything to get
on that reservation, won't you?

01:57.285 --> 01:58.570
You openly defy my orders

01:58.578 --> 01:59.738
and then come in here
with half a story...

01:59.745 --> 02:03.237
Carlson! He was screaming.
They were beating him!

02:03.249 --> 02:05.740
- Deploy the search!
- Get a hold of yourself, Detective.

02:05.751 --> 02:07.616
Your word is no good.

02:09.630 --> 02:12.007
Get out of my office.

02:13.050 --> 02:15.757
When internal affairs
makes the rounds after this...

02:15.761 --> 02:18.047
and they will...
how do think it's gonna look

02:18.055 --> 02:19.716
that you sat on your hands
and did nothing

02:19.724 --> 02:23.262
while one of your cops
was dying out in the field?

02:25.271 --> 02:28.889
You know I'm right.

02:30.443 --> 02:32.604
Linden, you stay away
from that reservation.

02:32.612 --> 02:33.818
You hear me?

03:23.245 --> 03:24.781
Yo, it's me.
Leave a message.

03:24.789 --> 03:27.030
Damn it.

04:12.753 --> 04:14.789
Where's my partner?!

04:14.797 --> 04:17.459
He was trespassing
on Indian land,

04:17.466 --> 04:19.627
and so are you.

04:19.635 --> 04:23.594
Seattle police
don't have jurisdiction here.

04:24.515 --> 04:26.801
Tell me where he is.

04:27.226 --> 04:29.808
Last I saw,
your boy general ouster

04:29.812 --> 04:32.019
was getting on the ferry.

04:34.775 --> 04:37.061
Move your truck.

04:47.913 --> 04:51.280
then this case will go federal

04:51.292 --> 04:53.203
and your "this is our land"
buHshﬂ

04:53.210 --> 04:54.825
goes right out the window.

04:56.505 --> 04:59.838
The feds won't stop till
they find what you're hiding.

04:59.842 --> 05:02.174
Seattle PD and coast guard
are en route.

05:02.178 --> 05:03.384
They should be here any minute.

05:03.387 --> 05:07.255
So I suggest you move your truck
and let me be on my way.

05:11.061 --> 05:13.017
Any minute, huh?

05:40.257 --> 05:41.292
Come on, Jake.

05:41.300 --> 05:42.801
Well, then,
get the DOJ on the phone

05:42.802 --> 05:44.713
and have them deal with
the Bureau of Indian affairs,

05:44.720 --> 05:46.631
I'm authorizing this search.

05:46.639 --> 05:48.721
Indians said he was conducting
an unlawful search.

05:48.724 --> 05:50.385
They escorted him
off the property.

05:50.392 --> 05:51.928
What the hell
were you two thinking?

05:51.936 --> 05:53.767
They're lying.
Holder's here.

05:53.771 --> 05:57.730
Whatever we find out there...
It's on you.

06:05.032 --> 06:08.195
Teams, we'll comb the field,
starting from the fire road,

06:08.202 --> 06:10.784
all routes leading
from the casino.

06:10.788 --> 06:12.119
It's a lot of ground to cover.

06:12.122 --> 06:13.862
How much time
do you think we have?

06:13.874 --> 06:15.489
Until dawn
before the lawyers show up,

06:15.501 --> 06:16.991
and that's if we're lucky.

06:17.002 --> 06:18.037
He was outside.

06:18.045 --> 06:19.876
It sounded like he was outside
when he called.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.120
You said that.

06:21.131 --> 06:22.962
The search would have been
a lot easier to narrow down

06:22.967 --> 06:24.707
if his phone had GPS.

06:24.718 --> 06:26.504
We'll be covering
all sectors of the island.

06:26.512 --> 06:28.252
Johnson, you'll take
the northeast division.

06:28.264 --> 06:30.129
And, Wortsman,
you'll cover the south end.

06:30.140 --> 06:32.176
- Yes, sir.
- Want to wait in the car?

06:32.184 --> 06:33.845
There's nothing you can do
right now.

06:33.853 --> 06:35.844
We've got this covered.

06:37.147 --> 06:38.728
Listen up, everybody.

06:39.149 --> 06:42.516
I need you all to be focused
and determined.

06:56.250 --> 06:57.581
I've got an urgent request.

06:57.585 --> 06:59.371
Repeat, ID needed on an item

06:59.378 --> 07:01.494
possibly belonging
to the missing officen

07:01.505 --> 07:02.915
Wait!

07:02.923 --> 07:04.208
Car 9820, proceed
to the intersection

07:04.216 --> 07:05.797
of Jameson Road,
northeast sector of the island.

07:05.801 --> 07:08.793
Tell them I'm coming.
Tell them!

07:21.859 --> 07:23.440
Do you recognize this, Sarah?

07:24.570 --> 07:25.605
Yeah.

07:25.613 --> 07:27.945
The road leads to a dump site
500 yards east.

07:27.948 --> 07:28.858
Let's go.

07:28.866 --> 07:30.106
What about the dogs?

07:30.117 --> 07:31.232
They lost his scent here.

07:31.243 --> 07:32.653
He may have been in a vehicle
at this time.

07:32.661 --> 07:34.652
Let's go!
Come on, let's go!

08:29.301 --> 08:31.417
Spread further out.

09:14.346 --> 09:16.302
Vasquez!

09:16.306 --> 09:17.591
Yes, sir.

09:17.599 --> 09:19.100
Holder's in those woods.

09:19.101 --> 09:20.637
What?

09:22.187 --> 09:23.472
The dogs picked up
the scent here.

09:23.480 --> 09:25.516
- We continued east to this dump site.
- Yeah.

09:25.524 --> 09:27.765
If we went west,
through these woods,

09:27.776 --> 09:29.152
there's a stream
just off the woods.

09:29.153 --> 09:30.393
If they crossed it with Holder,

09:30.571 --> 09:31.777
the dogs would have
lost his scent

09:31.780 --> 09:33.111
- because of the water, right?
- Yeah.

09:33.574 --> 09:36.907
Maybe we went the wrong way.

09:37.828 --> 09:40.319
He's in those woods.

09:46.545 --> 09:48.126
Everybody on me!

09:49.256 --> 09:50.006
Let's gather up!

09:50.007 --> 09:51.338
Let's go!
Moving out!

09:51.341 --> 09:53.753
Let's go, guys!
We're running out of time!

11:10.879 --> 11:12.995
- We've got something.
- You hear that? Hey.

11:15.134 --> 11:17.125
Let's go, guys.
Come on, guys. Let's go.

11:24.434 --> 11:26.015
Jesus.

11:35.112 --> 11:37.524
Let me through.
Let me through!

11:44.037 --> 11:45.993
We got him.

11:45.998 --> 11:47.989
Copy.

11:54.923 --> 11:56.538
Holder!

11:57.759 --> 11:59.135
Holder?

12:05.642 --> 12:07.553
Thank you for coming out
this morning.

12:07.561 --> 12:09.392
It's good to be going home.

12:09.396 --> 12:11.557
There's still
a long road ahead of us

12:11.565 --> 12:13.897
but only five days
before the election.

12:13.901 --> 12:18.190
And, uh... and that's what
we're focused on right now.

12:19.656 --> 12:22.773
still think you killed
the Larsen girl, Councilman.

12:22.784 --> 12:25.742
When the law
proves you innocent,

12:25.746 --> 12:27.577
they don't tell you
what office to visit

12:27.581 --> 12:28.787
to get your reputation back.

12:28.790 --> 12:32.203
But I've...
I've taken to heart

12:32.211 --> 12:35.578
what my old friend Ted
once said...

12:35.589 --> 12:37.955
"Bad luck either
breaks you or it makes you."

12:37.966 --> 12:42.255
And I have no intention
of letting this break me.

12:42.262 --> 12:46.722
Where were you the night
of Rosie Larsen's murder?

12:46.934 --> 12:50.267
The Councilman
is no longer a suspect.

12:50.270 --> 12:51.931
And we're using
every available resource

12:51.939 --> 12:53.679
to help the police
find the real killer

12:53.690 --> 12:55.351
who is still out there.

12:55.359 --> 12:56.690
Thank you for your questions.

12:56.693 --> 12:58.979
We have a full day ahead of us.

13:09.873 --> 13:13.161
Hi. I'm his partner.
How is he?

13:13.168 --> 13:15.705
He's got several contusions,
broken ribs,

13:15.712 --> 13:17.088
suffering from exposure.

13:17.089 --> 13:18.204
He needs time to rest.

13:18.215 --> 13:21.127
You can talk to him if you
come back later today probably.

13:39.569 --> 13:41.309
Hi, Jack.

13:41.321 --> 13:43.903
Yeah, he's, uh...
he's okay.

13:44.950 --> 13:46.941
Of course I'm fine.

13:52.124 --> 13:53.705
Well, you can tell him
next time you see him

13:53.709 --> 13:56.200
that he has to update
his music collection.

13:58.088 --> 14:00.795
Are you good to stay there
a little bit longer?

14:01.550 --> 14:03.711
Yeah,
I-I should be done soon.

14:04.803 --> 14:08.136
Hey... I love you.

14:08.140 --> 14:09.801
Okay, bye.

14:20.819 --> 14:23.731
Yeah, the reward is real.
Thanks for your help, pal.

14:23.739 --> 14:25.900
Why do we have
to go to nana and grandpa's?

14:25.907 --> 14:28.239
'Cause I'm working today.
Grandma's gonna cook.

14:28.243 --> 14:30.279
And they're taking you
to the zoo in the afternoon.

14:30.287 --> 14:33.074
- But grandma stinks.
- Well, she wears a lot of perfume.

14:33.081 --> 14:34.617
You boys got your toothbrushes?

14:34.624 --> 14:38.116
Why can't Aunt Terry just come
over and take care of us?

14:38.295 --> 14:40.331
Open the door.

14:45.427 --> 14:47.668
Hello, boys. Stan.

14:48.055 --> 14:50.216
Go ahead to the car.
I'll be along.

14:50.223 --> 14:52.009
I just want to have a word
with your father.

14:52.017 --> 14:53.848
I'm picking you up
for school tomorrow,

14:53.852 --> 14:55.717
so be ready
when I get there, okay?

14:56.938 --> 14:58.894
Appreciate you taking 'em
for the night.

14:59.066 --> 15:00.397
I got all sorts of tips
coming in

15:00.400 --> 15:01.389
from the TV thing.

15:01.401 --> 15:03.016
I got to get down
to the station now.

15:03.195 --> 15:08.189
Look, Stan, I understand
why you're doing this

15:08.200 --> 15:11.533
and I'm not in your position.

15:11.536 --> 15:14.494
But I'm wondering
if this ain't more attention

15:14.498 --> 15:16.989
than is good for the family.

15:18.043 --> 15:22.412
You're right,
you're not in my position.

15:27.094 --> 15:29.631
I'll, uh...
We'll see you in the morning.

15:30.514 --> 15:34.473
Yeah? Yeah, this is him.
This about the reward?

15:36.186 --> 15:38.017
Yeah, what do you got?

15:44.236 --> 15:45.601
Are you Linden?

15:45.612 --> 15:47.773
I'm his partner, yeah.

15:47.781 --> 15:49.237
How is he?

15:49.616 --> 15:51.277
How do you think?

15:53.787 --> 15:55.493
He shouldn't be doing this job.

15:55.497 --> 15:57.704
He could have gotten
himself killed.

15:57.707 --> 15:59.868
I'm sorry.

16:02.129 --> 16:04.370
Your brother's a good cop.

16:08.343 --> 16:10.379
He always wanted to be
good at something...

16:12.389 --> 16:14.425
Football...

16:15.892 --> 16:17.757
breakdancing.

16:19.855 --> 16:22.938
If you told me then that
being a cop would it...

16:24.609 --> 16:27.476
I know it's not easy.

16:29.197 --> 16:31.529
Nothing ever is with Stephen.

16:36.371 --> 16:38.407
He told me to give you this.

16:40.208 --> 16:42.540
First thing he said
when he got here...

16:42.544 --> 16:44.830
"Give this to Linden."

16:44.838 --> 16:46.294
Thank you.

16:48.633 --> 16:51.625
Maybe you should go.

16:51.636 --> 16:53.843
My brother needs to rest.

16:53.847 --> 16:56.133
You should let him.

17:25.086 --> 17:27.122
Can we have the room, please?

17:29.674 --> 17:31.175
Good to see you, Counselor.

17:31.176 --> 17:32.507
Nice to see you, Counselor.

17:32.511 --> 17:34.172
Counselor, nice to have you back.
Great. Thanks.

17:34.179 --> 17:35.589
Welcome back.

17:35.597 --> 17:38.179
We need you to get the
posters down in Pioneer Square.

17:38.183 --> 17:40.674
Thanks, guys.
We'll reconvene at 3:00.

17:40.685 --> 17:42.061
Good.

17:44.814 --> 17:47.897
Adams is leading by 7 points.

17:47.901 --> 17:52.691
Larsen hurt us... a lot.

17:54.574 --> 17:59.739
Darren... Adams is hammering
away at your alibi.

17:59.746 --> 18:01.702
The voters want answers.

18:01.706 --> 18:03.492
They need you
to set the record straight

18:03.500 --> 18:05.866
on where you were that night.

18:08.129 --> 18:12.919
Are you talking about
the voters, or just you two?

18:14.177 --> 18:15.383
Well, if you're gonna
avoid this,

18:15.387 --> 18:17.343
then we need a grand gesture.

18:17.347 --> 18:18.507
We have less than a week

18:18.515 --> 18:20.881
to restore voters'
confidence in you.

18:22.894 --> 18:24.885
You're right.

18:25.146 --> 18:28.013
I need something to remind
people I can lead this city.

18:29.818 --> 18:34.107
Now you just have to figure out
what that something will be.

18:40.537 --> 18:42.823
Good to see you.
Thanks for coming in.

18:42.831 --> 18:44.412
Nice seeing you, too.

18:44.958 --> 18:47.040
See you in a couple of weeks.

18:48.545 --> 18:50.627
See you then.
Appreciate it.

19:01.308 --> 19:05.597
I was told you were 6',
blond hair... and a man.

19:06.229 --> 19:08.390
That's my partner...
Detective Holder.

19:08.398 --> 19:10.684
He wasn't able to make it.

19:16.239 --> 19:19.106
Uncle, it's okay.

19:21.244 --> 19:24.077
You're his partner, an officer?

19:24.789 --> 19:26.871
Yeah, I'm Detective Linden.
You are?

19:29.794 --> 19:32.501
I'm the one who found
Rosie's backpack.

19:37.344 --> 19:40.586
I found her backpack
in the dumpster of the casino

19:40.597 --> 19:42.633
when I was taking out
the trash.

19:43.183 --> 19:45.720
I thought I should give it
back to her family

19:45.727 --> 19:49.436
so they could catch
who killed her.

19:51.858 --> 19:54.144
Is that
when you saw my partner?

19:54.903 --> 19:58.646
He showed up at the Larsens'
to look at the backpack?

19:58.657 --> 20:00.113
Yeah.

20:03.912 --> 20:07.575
They're wrong about Rosie.
She wasn't a prostitute.

20:08.583 --> 20:10.665
I mean, you should see
the prostitutes

20:10.669 --> 20:12.751
that hang around the casino.

20:13.630 --> 20:17.088
Me and her worked together.
She was really cool.

20:18.635 --> 20:21.593
Rosie was a maid, too.

20:30.980 --> 20:34.347
It's from the cleaning
chemicals we use.

20:34.943 --> 20:37.275
Chief Jackson
gets the cheap stuff.

20:38.238 --> 20:40.229
It really burns.

20:40.907 --> 20:42.989
It's ammonium hydroxide?

20:44.202 --> 20:47.285
It was on Rosie's hands, too.
Is that what you mean?

20:50.041 --> 20:53.283
Rosie's hair. The makeup.
If she was just a maid...

20:53.294 --> 20:55.956
Sometimes Rosie would work
the floor as a waitress.

20:55.964 --> 20:58.626
You almost
couldn't recognize her.

20:58.633 --> 21:00.419
Chief Jackson gets paid
more money

21:00.427 --> 21:03.464
if she pays us under the table,
makes us look older.

21:03.471 --> 21:06.087
'Cause we're just kids.

21:07.308 --> 21:09.560
She controls everything
on the rez.

21:10.729 --> 21:12.845
Who works, who doesn't.

21:13.398 --> 21:15.059
She sounds like
a real ball-buster,

21:15.066 --> 21:17.523
Chief Jackson.

21:23.992 --> 21:27.200
My uncle says she uses the tribe
to line her own pockets.

21:27.579 --> 21:30.286
She controls everyone.

21:31.124 --> 21:34.912
All I know is,
I wouldn't cross her.

21:37.213 --> 21:40.546
Was Rosie working the night
she was murdered?

21:40.550 --> 21:42.040
She wasn't on the schedule.

21:42.051 --> 21:44.633
That's why I thought it was
weird to see her there.

21:44.637 --> 21:47.174
You saw her that night?

21:48.224 --> 21:50.340
I was gonna say hi,

21:50.727 --> 21:53.685
but she got in an elevator
and I had to get to work.

21:54.022 --> 21:57.935
I mean, I don't know
why she was there.

21:57.942 --> 21:59.443
She already got paid.

21:59.444 --> 22:01.605
Where was she going?

22:01.613 --> 22:04.275
Hmm.

22:04.282 --> 22:06.398
Maybe to the 10th floor?

22:07.452 --> 22:09.909
Why would she go
up there, Mary?

22:11.080 --> 22:15.164
We'd take smoke breaks
up there.

22:16.044 --> 22:19.002
We were supposed to clean it up
before they shut it down.

22:19.005 --> 22:21.417
It was a construction site,
right?

22:21.424 --> 22:23.005
Yeah.

22:25.595 --> 22:27.756
Don't tell my uncle
I smoke, okay?

22:27.764 --> 22:31.256
Because I don't, really.
It's just only sometimes.

22:31.935 --> 22:34.142
Your secret's safe with me.

22:35.814 --> 22:39.147
Have you been back up there
since that night?

22:39.150 --> 22:41.436
No.

22:42.028 --> 22:45.020
They took away all our keys...

22:45.824 --> 22:49.316
The day after Rosie died.

22:53.414 --> 22:56.497
What does that key look like?

23:01.881 --> 23:03.963
Like I said,
I'm very optimistic.

23:03.967 --> 23:05.628
Good.
Keep hope alive, Tim,

23:05.635 --> 23:07.500
that's the essence
of my campaign.

23:07.512 --> 23:09.594
There's hope
for the waterfront yet.

23:13.852 --> 23:16.844
I thought I might find you
in here.

23:16.855 --> 23:19.767
Darren.
Welcome back.

23:19.774 --> 23:22.015
Feeding the piranhas, as usual.

23:23.111 --> 23:24.897
You want to call them back in?

23:24.904 --> 23:27.566
You can ask me where I was
that night, in person.

23:27.574 --> 23:28.689
On camera.

23:28.700 --> 23:30.281
I've got bigger fish to fry.

23:30.285 --> 23:31.741
The Indians are coming
to the table.

23:31.744 --> 23:33.245
They're gonna make a deal.

23:33.663 --> 23:36.075
Chief Jackson has you over
a barrel with the waterfront.

23:36.082 --> 23:37.447
But it's not you
she'll be screwing.

23:37.458 --> 23:39.414
How much is she taking
the city for?

23:41.462 --> 23:42.998
You take care now, Darren.

23:43.298 --> 23:45.414
I know about the photo.

23:51.764 --> 23:54.551
It's always good
seeing you, Lesley.

24:05.612 --> 24:07.193
There's no way
he could have found out.

24:07.196 --> 24:08.777
My contact's reliable.

24:08.781 --> 24:11.773
- He'd never talk to Richmond or...
- Well, someone else did.

24:12.619 --> 24:15.577
You find out who
and shut them the hell up.

24:22.378 --> 24:24.334
Detective!

24:26.883 --> 24:28.839
I've been getting calls
since last night.

24:29.177 --> 24:30.713
There's a lot
of good stuff here,

24:30.720 --> 24:32.256
I mean, some of it's
kind of crazy,

24:32.263 --> 24:33.969
but it's got to help, right?

24:33.973 --> 24:36.350
I'm meeting with some of them
later today.

24:36.351 --> 24:38.467
But here...
Look at them.

24:39.562 --> 24:41.473
Yeah, okay,
thanks, Mr. Larsen.

24:42.440 --> 24:44.681
Aren't you even
gonna look at it?

24:46.653 --> 24:49.611
Quite frankly,
this isn't going to help.

24:50.281 --> 24:51.487
You open a door like this,

24:51.491 --> 24:53.231
people will take advantage
of you.

24:53.242 --> 24:55.574
I've seen it before.

24:55.578 --> 24:58.320
I'm sorry.
I have to go.

25:08.007 --> 25:09.338
Hey, check her out.

25:09.342 --> 25:13.836
Left Holder out there to get
his ass kicked. Brutal.

25:18.434 --> 25:20.425
What the hell are you doing?

25:22.397 --> 25:24.058
Give us a minute.

25:31.364 --> 25:33.104
You're gonna have to say it.

25:33.908 --> 25:35.944
Your badge.

25:38.788 --> 25:40.449
They wouldn't have done
what they did to Holder

25:40.456 --> 25:41.957
if we weren't
on the right track.

25:41.958 --> 25:43.038
The right track?

25:43.042 --> 25:45.249
Do you have any idea
the political mess we're in

25:45.253 --> 25:46.584
after last night?

25:46.587 --> 25:48.498
Every officer in this building

25:48.506 --> 25:51.669
wants payback over Holder,
but that's not gonna happen.

25:51.676 --> 25:54.008
You disobeyed orders.

25:54.012 --> 25:56.503
And as a result, you nearly
got your partner killed.

25:56.514 --> 25:59.096
That alone should end
your career.

25:59.100 --> 26:01.933
And nothing personal,
detective,

26:01.936 --> 26:03.221
but I don't like you.

26:04.856 --> 26:07.347
DA Niilsen will press charges
against the casino.

26:07.358 --> 26:09.690
And the tribe will counter-sue
the department,

26:09.694 --> 26:12.060
the city, and county
for jurisdictional violation.

26:12.071 --> 26:15.984
Believe me, DA Niilsen
doesn't have time for you.

26:15.992 --> 26:18.779
Seattle Times will when
I send them the Richmond photo.

26:19.537 --> 26:21.277
It's your badge number

26:21.289 --> 26:23.826
assigned to that photo,
detective.

26:25.710 --> 26:28.167
This isn't a conversation.

26:40.224 --> 26:41.930
And your firearm.

26:50.401 --> 26:53.689
I understand you were
supposed to get married today.

26:54.447 --> 26:56.688
Sonoma, right?

26:57.325 --> 26:59.566
Nice place to raise a family.

27:16.260 --> 27:18.672
All right, what about Yitanes?

27:19.514 --> 27:20.879
Darren delivers a speech

27:20.890 --> 27:22.972
with a crowd
of union members behind him.

27:22.975 --> 27:24.966
It's a united front,
strength in numbers.

27:24.977 --> 27:27.184
Page four... at best.

27:27.188 --> 27:29.349
It's like you said,
we need something big,

27:29.357 --> 27:31.188
something that screams
page one.

27:31.192 --> 27:32.307
Mm-hmm.

27:35.196 --> 27:37.152
I'm meeting
about the new ad tonight,

27:37.156 --> 27:38.987
hoops for hopes
in the background,

27:38.991 --> 27:40.731
cheering on the one man
who can really understand

27:40.743 --> 27:43.280
the pulse
of Seattle's communities.

27:44.205 --> 27:46.287
Check this out.

27:46.290 --> 27:47.951
I'm very happy to report

27:47.959 --> 27:50.746
that I 'm currently in talks
with chief Nicole Jackson

27:50.753 --> 27:52.709
of the Kulamish tribe.

27:52.713 --> 27:55.455
We are both very optimistic
about a joint venture

27:55.466 --> 27:57.206
at Seattle's waterfront.

27:57.218 --> 27:59.504
It's an exciting opportunity
for the city...

28:01.722 --> 28:04.008
Waterfront.

28:04.016 --> 28:05.347
What about it?

28:05.351 --> 28:08.969
It's the cornerstone
of the mayor's campaign.

28:08.980 --> 28:11.892
And now he's going hat in hand
to Chief Jackson

28:11.899 --> 28:13.435
to get it back.

28:13.442 --> 28:15.228
If he doesn't have
the waterfront...

28:15.236 --> 28:17.443
He doesn't have
a pot to piss in.

28:17.446 --> 28:19.061
So we make sure
he doesn't get it back.

28:19.073 --> 28:20.358
And how do we do that?

28:20.366 --> 28:23.153
We take it from him.

28:25.621 --> 28:28.033
That's our page one.

28:41.888 --> 28:43.094
Where's my son?

28:43.097 --> 28:44.507
Are you Linden?

28:44.515 --> 28:46.927
Look, Lieutenant Carlson said
you can't be here.

28:46.934 --> 28:49.846
- Jack? Jack?
- Ma'am...

28:49.854 --> 28:52.220
Don't touch me!
Okay! All right.

28:52.231 --> 28:53.937
Calm down.

28:53.941 --> 28:55.556
What did you do with my son?

28:55.568 --> 28:57.729
Listen, I don't know anything
about your son.

28:57.737 --> 28:59.523
All right, we've been here
about an hour.

28:59.530 --> 29:01.441
There was no one here
when we got here.

29:04.535 --> 29:06.651
Jack.

29:06.662 --> 29:08.163
Jack.
Ma'am.

29:08.164 --> 29:09.825
Let go of me!
Let go of me!

29:09.832 --> 29:11.117
- Let go of me!
- Calm down! Miss Linden!

29:11.125 --> 29:13.116
Listen to me.

29:13.127 --> 29:16.164
You can't be here, miss Linden.

29:38.903 --> 29:41.485
Come on, Jack.

29:59.674 --> 30:00.880
Well, thanks, pal.

30:00.883 --> 30:03.545
I'll let you know
if the tip goes anywhere.

30:03.552 --> 30:05.338
Yeah.

30:16.399 --> 30:18.811
Mr. Larsen?

30:18.818 --> 30:21.730
I'm Naomi.

30:21.737 --> 30:24.695
Yeah. Uh, yeah, please.
Please have a seat.

30:29.245 --> 30:30.701
You said you, uh...

30:30.705 --> 30:33.242
You might have something
to help the case?

30:33.249 --> 30:35.991
I imagine people
like the last gentleman

30:36.002 --> 30:39.039
come out of the woodwork
at a time like this.

30:39.046 --> 30:40.752
It seems that way, doesn't it?

30:40.756 --> 30:44.499
They don't know what to say,
so they say "sorry"

30:44.510 --> 30:48.219
when it'd be better
that they said nothing at all.

30:48.222 --> 30:49.587
They don't understand

30:49.598 --> 30:53.967
that we'd rather just forget
about the social niceties.

30:57.148 --> 30:59.639
I lost a daughter, too.

31:04.196 --> 31:06.778
How old was she?

31:06.782 --> 31:08.283
Nine.

31:08.284 --> 31:14.029
Beautiful, sweet...
like Rosie.

31:17.293 --> 31:18.783
Thank you.

31:21.547 --> 31:24.289
On... on the phone, you said
that you knew my daughter.

31:24.300 --> 31:27.087
Do you work at the school or...

31:27.094 --> 31:29.255
You raised a good girl,
Mr. Larsen.

31:29.263 --> 31:31.254
You should be proud.

31:31.724 --> 31:34.181
Rosie told me all about you.

31:35.936 --> 31:38.268
She told me she loved you,

31:38.272 --> 31:42.891
despite everything that happened
between you, the past.

31:42.902 --> 31:47.191
She told me that you were
such a special daddy to her.

31:49.658 --> 31:51.819
She said that?

31:51.827 --> 31:54.910
Yes, and there's more.

31:57.083 --> 31:59.620
That's why I'm here,
Mr. Larsen.

32:02.671 --> 32:05.799
I know it may seem strange
at first,

32:05.800 --> 32:10.214
but for a small fee,
I can contact your daughter.

32:12.390 --> 32:15.052
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

32:15.059 --> 32:17.926
To speak to Rosie again?

32:17.937 --> 32:20.849
I know she misses you...
so much.

33:01.188 --> 33:03.679
I saw the cops pull up outside.

33:05.526 --> 33:08.108
I thought they were coming
to get me.

33:12.616 --> 33:14.652
I thought Regi would be here...

33:14.660 --> 33:16.196
But she's not.

33:16.871 --> 33:19.863
Nobody's here.

33:55.951 --> 33:57.782
Mayor Adams is meeting
with Chief Jackson

33:57.786 --> 33:59.162
of the Kulamish tribe.

33:59.163 --> 34:00.778
He told me.

34:01.332 --> 34:04.244
He'll lose the election
without them.

34:08.964 --> 34:11.125
You wanted a grand gesture.

34:11.133 --> 34:15.126
Chief Jackson makes Drexler
look like an altar boy.

34:15.137 --> 34:16.968
The waterfront is the key
to this election.

34:16.972 --> 34:19.008
We scheduled a sit-down
between you and Chief Jackson

34:19.016 --> 34:20.176
first thing tomorrow morning.

34:20.559 --> 34:22.550
Without consulting me?

34:22.561 --> 34:24.552
Well, we don't have time to
check with you on everything.

34:24.563 --> 34:26.428
You make the time.

34:27.733 --> 34:30.190
I pay for your
bad decisions, not you.

34:34.657 --> 34:36.488
You never let me in.

34:36.492 --> 34:38.983
And that's some sort of excuse?

34:38.994 --> 34:40.700
Why couldn't you tell me
where you were that night?

34:40.704 --> 34:42.205
Because you would not
have understood.

34:42.206 --> 34:43.946
What was I supposed to think?

34:43.958 --> 34:45.573
So you went to the police.

34:45.584 --> 34:47.324
Because you lied to me.

34:47.795 --> 34:51.253
You lied about everything,
about us,

34:51.257 --> 34:52.337
about all those women.

34:52.341 --> 34:53.831
So I deserve this?

35:01.225 --> 35:06.436
I'm late for a meeting
at the ad agency.

35:06.438 --> 35:09.020
We're... we're
creating new spots.

35:27.585 --> 35:29.667
Yo, half pint.

35:30.379 --> 35:32.335
Does it hurt?

35:33.007 --> 35:36.420
Nah, just looks worse
than it is.

35:36.427 --> 35:38.088
Just got to roll with the flow.

35:38.095 --> 35:39.881
Like my man Bruce Lee.

35:41.473 --> 35:43.634
Come here.

35:49.773 --> 35:51.229
Gimme some.

35:52.109 --> 35:53.474
Phew!

35:53.485 --> 35:55.441
Where's your moms at?

35:55.446 --> 35:57.357
She's outside smoking.

35:57.364 --> 35:58.695
Bad habit.

35:58.699 --> 36:01.031
Better not take that up, now.

36:01.035 --> 36:02.900
You hear?

36:04.913 --> 36:07.575
Are you gonna come over
again more now?

36:09.668 --> 36:12.205
Get me my jacket over there.

36:13.213 --> 36:15.955
Got something for you.

36:17.509 --> 36:20.296
Been carrying it
around with me.

36:20.304 --> 36:22.295
Waiting for the right
moment, I guess.

36:30.939 --> 36:33.521
Looks like the one
I used to have.

36:34.735 --> 36:36.521
Yeah.

36:36.528 --> 36:38.985
D...

36:41.116 --> 36:43.573
I just want you to know...

36:45.996 --> 36:48.863
your mom's
really great.

36:49.958 --> 36:52.244
She's the best.

36:52.252 --> 36:54.789
She's there for you.

36:57.257 --> 37:00.090
And I'm gonna be there
for you, too, now.

37:01.178 --> 37:04.261
24/7/365.

37:04.264 --> 37:07.301
You feel me?

37:11.188 --> 37:13.804
Now show me some of them
Bruce Lee moves I taught you, D.

37:15.693 --> 37:17.809
Oh-ho-ho.

37:19.071 --> 37:20.356
Kktggg!

37:20.364 --> 37:22.400
There you go.
What more you got?

37:22.408 --> 37:23.864
You got it.

37:29.748 --> 37:31.363
Good afternoon.

37:31.375 --> 37:34.242
We Will now begin boarding
flight 749 to Chicago,

37:34.253 --> 37:37.336
starting with our ﬁrst-class
and frequent-flyer customers.

37:37.339 --> 37:38.920
Your row's not boarding yet.

37:38.924 --> 37:40.380
We have a little more time.

37:45.180 --> 37:46.920
I'll see you again
before you know it.

37:46.932 --> 37:49.173
It's just temporary.

37:49.184 --> 37:51.596
Your dad will be
at the airport to meet you,

37:51.603 --> 37:53.468
but call me
when you get in, okay?

37:55.065 --> 37:57.226
Jack?

37:58.902 --> 38:02.144
Why can't you come with me?

38:06.952 --> 38:10.115
We'll see each other soon,
I promise.

38:10.122 --> 38:13.580
We Will now continue boarding
rows 25 through 36

38:13.584 --> 38:15.950
on flight 749 to Chicago.

38:15.961 --> 38:17.997
My row's boarding now.

38:21.175 --> 38:22.415
Jack!

38:22.718 --> 38:24.083
Jack, wait.
Hey!

38:24.303 --> 38:26.259
- Hang on.
- Mom, get off.

38:26.263 --> 38:27.924
Listen to me.
Listen to me.

38:31.852 --> 38:34.935
You're strong.

38:34.938 --> 38:37.054
You can do this.

38:37.524 --> 38:39.480
You are.

38:40.152 --> 38:42.188
You are so much stronger
than I was

38:42.196 --> 38:44.027
when I was your age.

38:44.656 --> 38:46.817
And no matter what happens,
you will get through it

38:46.825 --> 38:48.816
because...

38:49.703 --> 38:52.945
Because you are my boy, Jack.

38:52.956 --> 38:56.198
You are my baby.

39:13.894 --> 39:15.304
Bye.

40:17.624 --> 40:19.080
Hey.

40:21.128 --> 40:23.084
Little man called
to say goodbye.

41:03.170 --> 41:06.754
Darren has
and always will be a fighter

41:06.757 --> 41:09.248
I'm told by his surgeon,
Dr Madigan,

41:09.259 --> 41:12.547
another dear friend of mine,
that Darren will require

41:12.554 --> 41:14.761
a great deal
of physical therapy.

41:14.765 --> 41:16.346
It'll help clear things up
if he did.

41:19.770 --> 41:21.431
Any more questions?

41:21.438 --> 41:23.303
Uh, yes, over there.

41:32.032 --> 41:33.738
This is the whole problem.

41:33.742 --> 41:35.107
He says he's not guilty,

41:35.118 --> 41:36.528
and yet when he's questioned

41:36.536 --> 41:37.992
about his whereabouts
on that particular night,

41:37.996 --> 41:39.111
he refuses to answer

41:46.880 --> 41:49.292
Rosie's key.

41:49.299 --> 41:52.086
It'll get us into
the construction site.

41:52.094 --> 41:53.675
10th floor.

41:53.679 --> 41:56.261
It's where she was abducted.

41:58.016 --> 42:00.928
We need to get that key.
