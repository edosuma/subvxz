almost infused in these boards

our fun camera setup
we have down here.

40:57.556 --> 41:00.623
What we did is shot
this whole section just to see

41:00.625 --> 41:02.559
if we could catch
that chair moving.

41:02.561 --> 41:05.929
And I got absolutely
no activity at all,

41:05.931 --> 41:08.164
except for this one spot.

41:10.569 --> 41:11.767
See that?
-Oh.

41:11.769 --> 41:14.838
-Looked brighter.
-Just a little bit brighter.

41:14.840 --> 41:16.639
It's very strange.

41:16.641 --> 41:18.007
Yeah,
fog doesn't do that.

41:18.009 --> 41:19.375
No, no.

41:19.377 --> 41:20.777
So, the house is haunted.

41:20.779 --> 41:22.245
I mean, you guys knew that,
I guess.

41:22.247 --> 41:23.746
-Yeah.
-But it's confirmed.

41:23.748 --> 41:25.014
Like, you're --
I mean, the things

41:25.016 --> 41:26.416
that you're experiencing,

41:26.418 --> 41:29.752
we experienced
some of those, as well.

41:29.754 --> 41:31.788
Taking into consideration
all the activity

41:31.790 --> 41:35.358
that we experienced coupled
with the history of the house,

41:35.360 --> 41:40.430
I think what you have here
is a very residual type haunt.

41:40.432 --> 41:43.166
Something that's coming and kind
of shows itself here and there,

41:43.168 --> 41:45.401
but it's not going to
really interact with you,

41:45.403 --> 41:48.004
going to make noises here
and there, going to whistle,

41:48.006 --> 41:49.439
but not be dangerous.

41:49.441 --> 41:52.375
Nothing, nothing crazy,
nothing crazy paranormal.

41:52.377 --> 41:55.645
To us, that means it's safe.
-Okay.

41:55.647 --> 41:57.447
So, that's what we think
the majority

41:57.449 --> 42:01.017
of what's
going on is here.

42:01.019 --> 42:04.220
Thank you so much.
It really means the world to me.

42:06.625 --> 42:10.994
BERRY:
We experienced a ton of activity
in and around the house.

42:10.996 --> 42:14.230
Bye.
-Bye.

42:14.232 --> 42:17.567
Nothing was an eight-foot-tall
shadow figure attacking people,

42:17.569 --> 42:20.436
but there is clearly a haunting.

42:20.438 --> 42:22.939
If things pick back up
and Ethan's experiences

42:22.941 --> 42:24.340
from the woods continue,

42:24.342 --> 42:27.310
we will be back
and face it head-on.

42:27.312 --> 42:30.780
