and then our users
complained, of course.

08:31.641 --> 08:35.079
Because nobody joins Top Meet
to hook up with some...

08:35.123 --> 08:37.865
random nobody, and so
we had to kick her off.

08:37.908 --> 08:39.431
Okay, and is that
when she got angry

08:39.475 --> 08:40.737
and called to complain?

08:40.781 --> 08:43.348
[laughs] No, it was more
like she went psycho.

08:43.392 --> 08:45.394
Ah, well, boring people never
like to be told they're dull.

08:45.437 --> 08:46.438
Right, Detective?

08:46.482 --> 08:48.092
What did you do
after the call?

08:48.136 --> 08:50.007
I stayed here, I worked late.

08:50.051 --> 08:51.966
We've been busy as hell
these days.

08:52.009 --> 08:53.663
Not nearly, I can assure you.

08:53.707 --> 08:56.274
Well, I'd like to talk to anyone
who can corroborate your alibi.

08:56.318 --> 08:58.494
Also, I'll need a list
of any of the users

08:58.538 --> 08:59.582
that complained about Kim.

08:59.626 --> 09:00.888
No can do.

09:00.931 --> 09:02.063
With so many celebrity clients,

09:02.106 --> 09:04.065
our entire business model
is based off

09:04.108 --> 09:06.110
our ironclad privacy protocols.

09:06.154 --> 09:08.025
Fine, I'll just
get a warrant.

09:08.069 --> 09:09.157
Good luck with that.

09:09.200 --> 09:10.854
I mean, how long
did it take the FBI

09:10.898 --> 09:12.290
to hack one cell phone?

09:18.253 --> 09:19.994
Yep, I'll have
the tech team get on it.

09:20.037 --> 09:22.692
You got it, Chloe.
Ah!

09:22.736 --> 09:24.215
CHARLOTTE:
Hello, Ms. Lopez.

09:24.259 --> 09:29.351
I wanted to ask you something.

09:29.394 --> 09:31.875
You know this darkness
that you say you see in me?

09:31.919 --> 09:34.051
Mm-hmm.
I've been trying
to address it,

09:34.095 --> 09:36.097
and, uh, details would help.

09:36.140 --> 09:39.491
So, where do you
see it, exactly?

09:39.535 --> 09:40.971
How? When?

09:41.015 --> 09:42.886
Like, now.

09:42.930 --> 09:44.714
Right about there.

09:44.758 --> 09:47.151
Oh.

09:47.195 --> 09:48.718
Hmm.

09:48.762 --> 09:50.024
Little better?

09:50.067 --> 09:51.416
But you know, still,

09:51.460 --> 09:53.505
you don't exactly scream
rainbows and sunshine,

09:53.549 --> 09:55.595
even when you're not
wielding murder weapons.

09:55.638 --> 09:58.162
Well, for the record,
I wouldn't stab you,

09:58.206 --> 10:00.469
not here, with all
these cops around.

10:01.992 --> 10:04.604
Oh, come on, that was funny.

10:04.647 --> 10:07.607
Oh, yeah.
Ha, ha. Funny.

10:07.650 --> 10:08.825
Also dark.

10:08.869 --> 10:10.653
Right. Fair point.

10:10.697 --> 10:12.524
But it's cool.

10:12.568 --> 10:15.049
You know, being dark.

10:15.092 --> 10:16.616
To each their own,
you know?

10:16.659 --> 10:19.227
Wow, you really have this
"being good" thing down.

10:19.270 --> 10:20.663
Huh?

10:20.707 --> 10:23.927
You know, you might be
just the person to guide me.

10:23.971 --> 10:25.233
To where?

10:25.276 --> 10:28.366
Somewhere other than Hell.

10:28.410 --> 10:31.065
See, I've, um, I've learned

10:31.108 --> 10:34.459
that there are consequences
to my darkness.

10:34.503 --> 10:37.637
Really permanent ones,
as it turns out.

10:37.680 --> 10:41.423
And I was thinking
you could help me avoid them?

10:41.466 --> 10:42.511
No way, José.

10:42.554 --> 10:45.557
I mean, I wish
I could help you, I do,

10:45.601 --> 10:47.559
but I'm so busy.

10:47.603 --> 10:49.170
With what?You know.

10:49.213 --> 10:51.476
Cases, forensic stuff.

10:51.520 --> 10:53.696
The lieutenant won't be back
from medical leave

10:53.740 --> 10:57.091
until next week, so it's, like,
cray-cray up in here.

10:58.005 --> 10:59.746
ELLA:
Oh, hey, Dan.

10:59.789 --> 11:01.748
I bet you need me
to go do that thing, huh?

11:01.791 --> 11:03.924
That super urgent
forensic thing.

11:03.967 --> 11:05.403
Yeah, yeah. See?

11:05.447 --> 11:07.971
Cray-cray.

11:08.015 --> 11:10.974
Well...

11:11.018 --> 11:12.236
I'm just gonna...

11:12.280 --> 11:13.890
I was...
Yeah.

11:13.934 --> 11:16.110
Bye.

11:16.153 --> 11:18.460
[grunts]
Excuse me.

11:18.503 --> 11:20.462
LINDA: You know,
you're exposing yourself

11:20.505 --> 11:22.638
to dreadful consequences.

11:22.682 --> 11:24.596
And I'm not talking
bad Yelp reviews,

11:24.640 --> 11:25.989
I'm talking Hell.

11:26.033 --> 11:27.817
Turns out: real.

11:27.861 --> 11:28.992
[laughing]:
I know.

11:29.036 --> 11:30.515
I know, right?

11:30.559 --> 11:32.082
Shocker to me, too.

11:32.126 --> 11:36.347
But not as much as your dancing
queen candle arrangements!

11:36.391 --> 11:37.479
Hey,

11:37.522 --> 11:38.567
Linda.

11:38.610 --> 11:40.700
Is everything okay?Amenadiel, hi.

11:40.743 --> 11:42.049
I'm so glad you're here.

11:42.092 --> 11:44.094
I'm trying to plan
my ex-husband's memorial,

11:44.138 --> 11:47.010
and I could really use
another opinion.

11:47.054 --> 11:50.187
Um, okay. So, which one
do you like best?

11:50.231 --> 11:52.320
Just, knee-jerk reaction.

11:52.363 --> 11:53.451
Go.

11:53.495 --> 11:55.366
That one?

11:55.410 --> 11:57.542
Really?

11:57.586 --> 11:59.022
Really? You don't think
it's too ornate?

11:59.066 --> 11:59.849
That one.

11:59.893 --> 12:01.024
You're right.

12:01.068 --> 12:03.418
This one's simple,
yet elegant.

12:03.461 --> 12:05.550
See, you're just
the insight I needed.

12:05.594 --> 12:06.682
Busy tomorrow?

12:08.771 --> 12:11.556
LUCIFER: That looks
absolutely nothing

12:11.600 --> 12:13.123
like our victim.

12:13.167 --> 12:14.342
Take note, Daniel.
These filters

12:14.385 --> 12:15.604
could be the answer
to your dating drought.

12:15.647 --> 12:17.040
ELLA:
Or not-- I mean,

12:17.084 --> 12:18.563
Kim only got one match.

12:18.607 --> 12:19.826
What-- really?

12:19.869 --> 12:21.349
After all the effort
our shoe went through

12:21.392 --> 12:22.654
to make herself
look like a top hat,

12:22.698 --> 12:24.395
she only got the interest
of one gentleman?

12:24.439 --> 12:26.876
Gentleman? You mean suspect.

12:26.920 --> 12:29.183
Yep. Username,
FOREVER29.

12:29.226 --> 12:30.314
The app arranged
a date for them,

12:30.358 --> 12:31.751
and based on their likes
and locations,

12:31.794 --> 12:33.753
it suggested a sushi place
on Melrose.

12:33.796 --> 12:36.320
Even made a reservation for them
for the night of the murder.

12:36.364 --> 12:37.974
CHLOE: This guy's
using the app

12:38.018 --> 12:40.107
as a hunting ground; he could be
targeting somebody right now.

12:40.150 --> 12:41.325
We got to find him.

12:41.369 --> 12:43.414
Yeah, but how?
We can't even get an I.D.

12:43.458 --> 12:45.025
Yeah. Tech team hasn't
been able to crack

12:45.068 --> 12:46.287
Top Meet's security algo.

12:46.330 --> 12:49.203
Which means Kim had
mad hacking skills.

12:49.246 --> 12:51.509
So can we use
FOREVER29's profile pic

12:51.553 --> 12:53.294
and run it through
facial recognition?

12:53.337 --> 12:54.991
Yeah, I know, I thought
about that, but...

12:55.035 --> 12:56.123
[Lucifer groans]

12:56.166 --> 12:57.428
LUCIFER:
Partial profiles pics.

12:57.472 --> 12:59.430
Such a telltale sign
of low self-esteem.

12:59.474 --> 13:00.910
Or our guy's keeping
his profile secret

13:00.954 --> 13:02.390
because he's the killer.

13:02.433 --> 13:04.218
ELLA: Wait a minute, there is
some good news, you guys.

13:04.261 --> 13:06.960
He used the app to RSVP
for a mixer at Top Meet.

13:07.003 --> 13:08.091
It's happening tonight.

13:08.135 --> 13:09.527
Okay. We got to get
to this party.

13:09.571 --> 13:11.834
Use what we know about FOREVER29
and single him out.

13:11.878 --> 13:13.314
LUCIFER:
Okay, fine. I'll go.

13:13.357 --> 13:14.837
Seeing as I'm the only
interesting single person here,

13:14.881 --> 13:17.144
I think I'm our one shot
to catching the killer.

13:17.187 --> 13:18.623
Lucifer, we're looking
for a guy.

13:18.667 --> 13:19.494
Your point?

13:19.537 --> 13:20.408
DAN:
Uh...

13:20.451 --> 13:21.801
He's a dude. And he's straight.

13:21.844 --> 13:23.454
Mm-hmm.That's never stopped me
before, Daniel.

13:23.498 --> 13:25.935
I'm so good at flipping men,
they call me The Skillet.

13:25.979 --> 13:27.241
Oh, wow.
Okay.

13:27.284 --> 13:28.938
We need a woman, so I'll go.

13:28.982 --> 13:32.202
What? You, Detective?
Socialize and flirt? Come on.

13:32.246 --> 13:35.379
Yeah, but for the investigation,
I can sacrifice.

13:35.423 --> 13:38.078
Can't be that hard
being frivolous and shallow.

13:38.121 --> 13:40.123
I'll just channel
my inner Lucifer.

13:40.167 --> 13:42.430
What, you want to become
a female version of me?

13:42.473 --> 13:43.387
Okay.

13:43.431 --> 13:44.824
I'll gladly train you.

13:44.867 --> 13:47.087
Chloe does Lucifer?

13:47.130 --> 13:48.479
I wouldn't exactly word it
that way...

13:48.523 --> 13:51.178
Get ready to go
full me, Detective.

13:56.400 --> 13:58.315
LUCIFER: Oh, the Paris shows
were glorious.

13:58.359 --> 13:59.751
Yes, worth the jetlag alone.

13:59.795 --> 14:00.927
How was yourweekend?

14:00.970 --> 14:02.406
CHLOE:
Uh, awesome. Great.

14:02.450 --> 14:05.018
Uh, Saturday,
went camping with my daughter.

14:05.061 --> 14:07.455
And, uh, Sunday,
did a big Costco run.

14:07.498 --> 14:10.806
[laughs] There's, like,
300 hot dogs in my freezer.

14:10.850 --> 14:13.374
Oh, really?
That is so interest...

14:13.417 --> 14:15.680
Oh, dear. Look what you did
to poor Giancarlo.

14:15.724 --> 14:17.682
Dead from boredom.

14:17.726 --> 14:19.467
Now, look, you're going
to this Top Meet mixer

14:19.510 --> 14:20.903
to hunt down a killer,

14:20.947 --> 14:22.470
not to talk about your hunt
for bulk food bargains.

14:22.513 --> 14:23.906
Okay.

14:23.950 --> 14:26.953
Sorry I'm not fancy-schmancy
enough for Giancarlo.

14:26.996 --> 14:28.345
Okay, let's get
the terminology straight.

14:28.389 --> 14:29.477
Not "fancy-schmancy."

14:29.520 --> 14:30.826
Sophisticated.

14:30.870 --> 14:31.958
Oh, whatever.

14:32.001 --> 14:34.003
Why don't you just
give me some tips

14:34.047 --> 14:36.614
on how to blend in
with that crowd. Okay?

14:36.658 --> 14:38.138
You think being
as fascinating as I am

14:38.181 --> 14:40.488
can be boiled down
to a few tips?

14:40.531 --> 14:42.577
This is not paint by numbers.

14:42.620 --> 14:44.013
Goodness me, I need a drink.

14:45.667 --> 14:47.147
Oh. Thank you.

14:47.190 --> 14:49.758
I have a tip, Mom.
Don't talk about me.Mm. Mm!

14:49.801 --> 14:53.022
Yes, definitely,
no mention of the child.

14:53.066 --> 14:53.980
Ugh.

14:54.023 --> 14:55.111
And enough with the tips.

14:55.155 --> 14:56.634
Why don't we do
a little role-play, hmm?

14:56.678 --> 14:58.723
Okay.You be a randy single man,

14:58.767 --> 14:59.855
I'll be...

14:59.899 --> 15:02.031
I'll be the new you.

15:02.902 --> 15:03.903
Okay, I've never once done that.

15:03.946 --> 15:05.730
LUCIFER:
My point exactly.

15:05.774 --> 15:07.950
Meet Lucinda. Come on.

15:12.955 --> 15:15.392
Gosh, this is gonna be
harder than I thought.

15:15.436 --> 15:16.698
[sighs]

15:26.577 --> 15:28.231
Oh, crap.

15:28.275 --> 15:29.537
[mouthing]

15:29.580 --> 15:31.931
[panting]

15:33.367 --> 15:34.977
[elevator bell dings]

15:35.021 --> 15:36.283
[grunts]

15:46.032 --> 15:47.642
Oh.

15:48.556 --> 15:50.253
Need some help there, sir?

15:50.297 --> 15:51.820
There you go.

15:54.475 --> 15:56.999
[exhales]

15:58.827 --> 16:00.220
Good news, Ella.

16:00.263 --> 16:02.918
I've been admitted to
the Forensic Shadow Program.

16:02.962 --> 16:04.572
What is that?

16:04.615 --> 16:05.834
A mentorship program.

16:05.877 --> 16:07.270
Which means I will be
your student.

16:07.314 --> 16:09.316
I am going to stick
to you like glue,

16:09.359 --> 16:12.580
so I can learn how
to be good... at forensics.

16:12.623 --> 16:14.277
Stuff comes up
constantly in court.

16:14.321 --> 16:16.845
That's great.UNI: Hold it, please!

16:18.151 --> 16:19.456
[panting]

16:19.500 --> 16:20.718
Oh, I don't think so, buddy.

16:20.762 --> 16:22.938
I mean, what am I,
Mother Teresa?

16:36.430 --> 16:37.822
My, my.

16:37.866 --> 16:39.302
Detective.

16:39.346 --> 16:40.477
You look...

16:40.521 --> 16:42.131
Like a female Lucifer?

16:42.175 --> 16:43.741
Well, that's what
I was going for.

16:43.785 --> 16:44.960
[chuckles]
Well,

16:45.004 --> 16:48.659
close enough,
but you're going to need this.

16:48.703 --> 16:51.140
Do I really need to wear
an ear bug?

16:51.184 --> 16:52.185
Absolutely.

16:52.228 --> 16:53.273
From what we know
about our killer,

16:53.316 --> 16:54.926
blue-eyed sushi snob
who loves surfing

16:54.970 --> 16:57.190
and splooshing, I'd say you're
a bit out of your comfort zone,

16:57.233 --> 16:59.888
so you're going to need
to bring Lucinda's A game.

16:59.931 --> 17:01.063
You mean yourA game.

17:01.107 --> 17:02.630
Absolutely.
Oh, and while we're at it,

17:02.673 --> 17:04.414
do you need a refresher on
"splooshing"? It's very simple.

17:04.458 --> 17:06.329
You just cover yourself in...No, no. Stop.
I'm good, I'm good.

17:06.373 --> 17:07.896
But-- oh.

17:07.939 --> 17:09.898
Except for...

17:09.941 --> 17:11.204
What, you don't want to wear it?

17:11.247 --> 17:12.292
It's not...

17:12.335 --> 17:13.771
really Lucinda's style.

17:13.815 --> 17:15.338
Right.

17:15.382 --> 17:16.078
Oh.

17:20.387 --> 17:22.780
Okay.

17:22.824 --> 17:24.173
There.

17:24.217 --> 17:25.305
I'm ready.

17:25.348 --> 17:26.915
Yes, you are.

17:26.958 --> 17:28.569
Good luck.

17:28.612 --> 17:30.440
Thank you.

Hi. I'll get a, uh, IPA, please.

LUCIFER [over bug]:
No. No, no, no, no, no, no.

17:51.766 --> 17:53.811
Not beer. Prosecco.

17:53.855 --> 17:55.335
But I hate Prosecco.

17:55.378 --> 17:57.946
Well, tough luck.
Lucinda loves it.

17:57.989 --> 18:00.079
[laughs]
Beer.

18:00.122 --> 18:01.471
It's a good job I'm here.

18:01.515 --> 18:03.082
Yeah, man. Close call.

18:09.131 --> 18:11.220
Possible suspect, moving in.

18:11.264 --> 18:12.700
LUCIFER:
Right. Whatever he says to you,

18:12.743 --> 18:14.093
just laugh.

18:14.136 --> 18:16.095
[laughs softly]
Hey there.

18:16.138 --> 18:18.227
What's your name?

18:18.271 --> 18:20.142
[laughs]

18:20.186 --> 18:21.100
Lucinda.

18:21.143 --> 18:22.492
LUCIFER: No, no...[laughs]

18:22.536 --> 18:24.929
Not like a demented witch
on crack.

18:24.973 --> 18:27.149
A deep, sultry laugh.

18:27.193 --> 18:30.631
[laughs]

18:30.674 --> 18:31.719
Ha, ha, ha.

18:31.762 --> 18:33.112
Ha-- I'm sorry.

18:33.155 --> 18:35.940
I think I may have had
a little too much Prosecco

18:35.984 --> 18:37.855
on an empty stomach.

18:37.899 --> 18:38.943
I should have
had that sushi.

18:38.987 --> 18:40.467
Did you try the
sushi? Is it good?

18:40.510 --> 18:43.252
No, no. I didn't.
I'm a, I'm a vegan.

18:43.296 --> 18:44.123
Oh.

18:44.166 --> 18:45.254
Anyway.

18:45.298 --> 18:47.778
You might want to go easy
on the bubbles.

18:47.822 --> 18:50.303
Ah.

18:50.346 --> 18:51.391
[sighs]

18:51.434 --> 18:52.653
Smooth.

18:52.696 --> 18:54.002
Beginner's bad luck.

18:54.045 --> 18:56.135
Look, it's hard
to do justice

18:56.178 --> 18:58.006
to my captivating essence,
but she'll get the hang of it.

18:58.049 --> 19:00.574
Don't be such
a Debbie Downer, Daniel.

19:02.619 --> 19:05.144
[quietly]:
Sorry.

19:09.757 --> 19:11.715
Hey.Hey.

19:11.759 --> 19:13.152
Hi.

19:13.195 --> 19:14.283
You're really tan.

19:14.327 --> 19:16.111
Are you, uh, are you a surfer?

19:16.155 --> 19:18.461
Well, I'd sure like to surf
in your eyes.

19:18.505 --> 19:19.854
LUCIFER:
Ugh, dearie me.

19:19.897 --> 19:22.248
He's lucky it's not a crime
to be a cheeseball.

19:22.291 --> 19:23.988
Anyway, at least
the ice is broken.

19:24.032 --> 19:25.903
Now, just make small talk.

19:25.947 --> 19:28.689
So I drove up
to this meditation retreat

19:28.732 --> 19:30.299
in Big Sur last week.

19:30.343 --> 19:31.344
No, no, no!

19:31.387 --> 19:32.432
PCH is closed.

19:32.475 --> 19:33.563
Say you helicoptered...

19:33.607 --> 19:34.477
Shush.

19:34.521 --> 19:36.044
Uh, excuse me?

19:36.087 --> 19:38.177
Sploosh. I said "sploosh."

19:38.220 --> 19:40.179
Are you into splooshing?

19:56.717 --> 19:57.935
[sighs]

19:57.979 --> 20:00.938
Time to change tactics.

20:00.982 --> 20:02.505
You know what?

20:04.115 --> 20:06.205
Enjoy the Prosecco, Lucinda.

20:08.555 --> 20:10.209
I don't believe this.

20:10.252 --> 20:12.080
Ditching protocol mid-sting?

20:12.123 --> 20:13.342
Who does that?

20:13.386 --> 20:15.692
Maybe she'll do better
on her own.

20:15.736 --> 20:16.954
Don't be ridiculous, Daniel.

20:16.998 --> 20:18.869
She'll flounder
without my expert guidance.

20:18.913 --> 20:20.044
Oh, yeah.
Right.

20:20.088 --> 20:21.611
I'm clearly needed
on the front lines.

20:21.655 --> 20:23.918
You just stay here
and do what you do best.

20:25.398 --> 20:26.616
Nada.

20:26.660 --> 20:28.401
[scoffs]

20:31.404 --> 20:32.840
CHLOE:
Oh, I love traveling.

20:32.883 --> 20:33.971
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

20:34.015 --> 20:35.103
Any fun plans coming up?

20:35.146 --> 20:37.627
Um, well, I...

20:37.671 --> 20:40.456
I was thinking of, uh,
maybe getting out of the city

20:40.500 --> 20:42.850
and taking my
daughter camping.

20:42.893 --> 20:43.981
Cool.

20:44.025 --> 20:45.809
I-I love the outdoors.

20:45.853 --> 20:46.984
CHLOE: Oh.I'm a surfer.

20:47.028 --> 20:48.725
CHLOE:
Really?

20:48.769 --> 20:50.074
Goes well with camping.

20:50.118 --> 20:51.946
I've always wanted
to try surfing.

20:51.989 --> 20:53.121
But I...You should...

20:53.991 --> 20:55.123
Oh, hi, Lucifer.

20:55.166 --> 20:56.429
This is Benji.

20:57.125 --> 20:57.865
CHLOE:
He just had

20:57.908 --> 20:59.258
four pieces of sashimi,

20:59.301 --> 21:00.955
and we just started
talking about surfing.

21:00.998 --> 21:02.565
Oh, lovely. Now, I insist

21:02.609 --> 21:04.175
you put your mic back in
immediately.

21:04.219 --> 21:05.568
We can't hear a thing
in the truck.

21:05.612 --> 21:07.266
You are being quite loud.

21:07.309 --> 21:09.180
[groans]
Nice work.

21:10.051 --> 21:12.009
LUCIFER:
Bloody hell.

21:12.053 --> 21:13.272
WOMAN:
Hey, there goes Benji!

21:13.315 --> 21:15.622
MAN:
Benji, over here!

21:15.665 --> 21:17.580
Whoa.You have to save me from them.

21:17.624 --> 21:18.929
DAN:
Uh, yeah.

21:18.973 --> 21:21.149
They're with me.

21:21.192 --> 21:22.759
Not bad for nada, huh?

21:22.803 --> 21:23.891
[chuckles]

21:23.934 --> 21:24.935
Wait, she's a cop?

21:24.979 --> 21:26.285
Detective Decker, LAPD.

21:26.328 --> 21:28.112
We want to talk to you
about a murder.

21:28.156 --> 21:29.766
MAN:
Benji, you're the best, bro!

21:29.810 --> 21:30.985
You're not paparazzi?

21:31.028 --> 21:32.595
What?

21:32.639 --> 21:33.770
Oh, thank God.

21:33.814 --> 21:36.469
I mean, the things
Dad gets credit for.

21:36.512 --> 21:37.470
[mouths]

21:41.561 --> 21:43.737
Yeah, I went on a date with her.

21:43.780 --> 21:46.130
Just the other night.

21:46.174 --> 21:49.003
Still can't believe she's, uh...
she's dead.

21:49.046 --> 21:50.439
Oh?

21:50.483 --> 21:52.876
Did you think she'd survive
you murdering her?

21:52.920 --> 21:54.791
I told you, I'm innocent.

21:54.835 --> 21:56.097
Well, you're an overpaid DJ,

21:56.140 --> 21:57.751
so that's up for debate.

21:57.794 --> 22:00.623
It seems you were the last
person to see Kim alive.

22:00.667 --> 22:02.103
I couldn't have been.

22:02.146 --> 22:03.496
When I dropped her off
after our date,

22:03.539 --> 22:04.758
her roommate was still there.

22:04.801 --> 22:06.107
How do you know that?

22:06.150 --> 22:07.630
Because that's the reason
I didn't go upstairs

22:07.674 --> 22:09.153
like Kim suggested.

22:09.197 --> 22:10.372
I was trying to avoid Esther.

22:10.416 --> 22:12.026
What, kombucha martini girl?

22:12.069 --> 22:13.767
Do you know her roommate?

22:13.810 --> 22:15.638
To the extent
that you can know someone

22:15.682 --> 22:17.771
who's glued to her phone
and talks in hashtags.

22:17.814 --> 22:19.076
[scoffs]Yep, that's her.

22:19.120 --> 22:20.426
How did you two meet?

22:20.469 --> 22:23.820
We matched on the Top Meet app
a few weeks ago.

22:23.864 --> 22:25.213
Went on two exhausting dates.

22:25.256 --> 22:28.129
Then why go on the second date?

22:28.172 --> 22:29.652
Because I wanted
to see Kim again.

22:29.696 --> 22:32.394
I met her at the apartment
when I picked up Esther

22:32.438 --> 22:34.178
for our first date.

22:34.222 --> 22:36.398
She wasn't there
the second time.

22:36.442 --> 22:38.400
So you can imagine
how stoked I was

22:38.444 --> 22:39.967
when she popped up
on the Top Meet app.

22:40.010 --> 22:40.968
LUCIFER:
No.

22:41.011 --> 22:42.535
I can't, actually.

22:42.578 --> 22:44.406
You're saying that you used
a top hat to get to a shoe?

22:44.450 --> 22:46.147
He must be lying, Detective.

22:46.190 --> 22:47.409
BENJI:
I'm not lying.

22:47.453 --> 22:49.498
I really liked Kim.

22:49.542 --> 22:52.283
She was different than all
the other women on the app.

22:52.327 --> 22:53.546
What, different as in duller,

22:53.589 --> 22:55.417
more mundane
and dressed for less?

22:55.461 --> 22:57.550
No, as in she
didn't make me feel

22:57.593 --> 23:00.161
like I had to be on
all the time.

23:00.204 --> 23:03.382
With her, I could...

23:03.425 --> 23:05.296
I could just be myself.

23:06.341 --> 23:07.429
Interesting.

23:09.475 --> 23:10.389
Thanks.

23:11.868 --> 23:13.043
[clears throat]

23:13.087 --> 23:15.611
What if Esther found out
about Benji and Kim?

23:15.655 --> 23:17.134
Got jealous,
lost control...

23:19.528 --> 23:22.618
This goddess,
jealous of the plain Jane?

23:22.662 --> 23:23.880
It's-it's ludicrous!

23:23.924 --> 23:26.056
It's like me being jealous
of that paper clip.

23:26.100 --> 23:27.144
Or Daniel.

23:27.188 --> 23:29.320
I mean, not to mention

23:29.364 --> 23:32.411
Esther is far too busy
for murder, Detective.

23:32.454 --> 23:34.238
Look. She flew
to Florence last week

23:34.282 --> 23:35.544
just 'cause she fancied
eating some gelato.

23:35.588 --> 23:37.285
She went on a plane
to get ice cream?

23:37.328 --> 23:39.505
Well, when you say it in
English, it sounds silly.

23:39.548 --> 23:42.116
Oh. Hello.
Look at that belfie.

23:42.159 --> 23:44.945
[chuckles] Bet you could bounce
a quarter off that derrière.

23:46.599 --> 23:48.165
Oh. Yeah...

23:49.384 --> 23:50.864
Wait, uh, go back.

23:50.907 --> 23:52.561
There.What?

23:52.605 --> 23:54.911
Something small and compact

23:54.955 --> 23:56.347
and surprisingly heavy
for its size.

23:56.391 --> 23:58.088
Well, what's Miss Lopez's
Aunt Rosalita

23:58.132 --> 23:59.438
got to do with anything?

24:00.830 --> 24:01.788
Look.

24:01.831 --> 24:03.093
The dumbbell.

24:03.137 --> 24:04.312
It wasn't at the crime scene.

24:04.355 --> 24:06.270
It matches the bruises
on the victim,

24:06.314 --> 24:07.489
it's a weapon
of convenience,

24:07.533 --> 24:09.360
and it fits the crime of passion
scenario.

24:09.404 --> 24:11.885
Doesn't mean Esther was
the one to wield it, though.

24:11.928 --> 24:14.061
If my theory of jealousy
is right, she was.

24:14.104 --> 24:15.845
Trust me, Detective,

24:15.889 --> 24:18.152
there's no way that Esther
has ever used a weight--

24:18.195 --> 24:20.502
I refer once again to her
naturally sublime derrière.

24:29.511 --> 24:31.731
[quietly]:
Oh, crap.

24:45.658 --> 24:47.964
You're avoiding me, aren't you?

24:48.008 --> 24:49.879
Don't be crazy.

24:49.923 --> 24:51.620
No. I just...

24:51.664 --> 24:55.015
you know,
like my floors spotless.

24:55.058 --> 24:58.366
An evidence lab can
never be too clean.

24:58.409 --> 25:02.892
And that is your Forensic
Lesson of the Day.

25:02.936 --> 25:04.067
More next week?

25:04.111 --> 25:05.939
Why don't you want to mentor me?

25:05.982 --> 25:08.681
It's not that
I don't want to, okay?

25:08.724 --> 25:09.986
I just don't have the time.

25:10.030 --> 25:11.292
Well, I've been watching you.

25:11.335 --> 25:12.293
You have plenty of time.

25:12.336 --> 25:14.077
You just waste it chitchatting.

25:14.121 --> 25:15.644
You mean socializing?

25:15.688 --> 25:18.995
Connecting with people
isn't a waste.

25:19.039 --> 25:20.562
Okay.

25:20.606 --> 25:23.652
Let's be honest here.

25:23.696 --> 25:27.569
You don't really care about
anyone's kids or whatever.

25:27.613 --> 25:29.658
I mean, you're faking it, right?

25:29.702 --> 25:32.792
Just tell me, how do you keep
your eyes from glazing over?

25:34.489 --> 25:36.622
There is no Forensic Shadow
Program, is there?

25:37.971 --> 25:41.540
Even if I had been
tempted to help--

25:41.583 --> 25:44.194
and I'm not saying
that I had--

25:44.238 --> 25:45.892
now that I know you lied?

25:45.935 --> 25:47.589
Poof!

25:47.633 --> 25:50.897
Temptation officially gone.

25:53.900 --> 25:54.988
♪ All right

25:57.817 --> 26:00.297

26:10.264 --> 26:14.050
and two long, two long
buffet tables over here...

26:14.094 --> 26:15.443
or should we do three?

26:15.486 --> 26:17.227
Well, it depends. How
many people are coming?

26:17.271 --> 26:18.794
Uh, just 350.

26:18.838 --> 26:21.057
350?

26:21.101 --> 26:22.581
Wow.

26:22.624 --> 26:24.800
I didn't realize how much
you still cared about Reese.

26:24.844 --> 26:25.714
Of course I do!

26:25.758 --> 26:27.455
I'm heartbroken about his death.

26:27.498 --> 26:29.283
Distraught, really.

26:29.326 --> 26:30.719
Can barely function.

26:32.068 --> 26:34.027
Okay, okay.

26:34.070 --> 26:37.639
Okay, okay, okay, okay,
I'm functioning perfectly.

26:37.683 --> 26:39.119
I only feel terrible

26:39.162 --> 26:40.860
that I don'tfeel terrible
about his death.

26:40.903 --> 26:42.992
Okay, so all of this
is just a...

26:43.036 --> 26:44.820
A pathetic attempt
to cover up the fact

26:44.864 --> 26:49.651
that I can't stop thinking
about me.

26:49.695 --> 26:51.740
Me, me.

26:51.784 --> 26:53.873
Me and my own brush with death.

26:53.916 --> 26:56.092
I understand, Linda. I mean...How could you
possibly understand

26:56.136 --> 26:57.920
what it's like to be rotisseried

26:57.964 --> 27:00.488
by the, by the goddess
of all creation?

27:02.490 --> 27:04.666
Dealing with mortality
was so much easier

27:04.710 --> 27:07.626
when I was just another
clueless idiot.

27:09.062 --> 27:13.501
Being a celestial insider...
really sucks.

27:13.544 --> 27:15.416
I used to walk
around thinking

27:15.459 --> 27:18.680
maybe reincarnation wasreal.

27:18.724 --> 27:20.987
Sure, it sounded bonkers,

27:21.030 --> 27:25.556
but I could still wonder,
still hope.

27:27.297 --> 27:30.126
What if I came back
as a chameleon or something?

27:31.998 --> 27:33.521
Chameleons are cool.

27:35.523 --> 27:37.568
But now I know
that's never happening,

27:37.612 --> 27:41.660
because I know,
you know, everything,

27:41.703 --> 27:45.141
including where I'm headed
when... when this is over.

27:45.185 --> 27:46.534
And where is that?

27:46.577 --> 27:47.883
Where do you think?

27:49.798 --> 27:52.409
I wish I'd never met any of you.

27:59.982 --> 28:03.769
CHLOE: So we wanted
to, uh, ask you

28:03.812 --> 28:04.987
a few...

28:05.031 --> 28:06.902
Would you want
to put on a shirt,

28:06.946 --> 28:09.905
or anything to cover...
your body?

28:09.949 --> 28:12.603
No. Why? Are you cold?

28:12.647 --> 28:14.170
Yes. Would you like
my jacket, Detective?

28:14.214 --> 28:15.694
No. I am great, thank you.

28:15.737 --> 28:16.912
Right.

28:16.956 --> 28:20.176
So, when was this photo taken?

28:20.220 --> 28:25.921
Uh, I took that on my way
to Tokyo, I think.

28:25.965 --> 28:27.401
Sorry.

28:27.444 --> 28:29.403
I travel so much,
it's hard to keep track.

28:29.446 --> 28:30.360
[laughs]

28:30.404 --> 28:31.710
It's actually
something else

28:31.753 --> 28:33.059
that we're trying to track down.

28:33.102 --> 28:34.364
This pink dumbbell here?

28:34.408 --> 28:36.105
It went missing
the night of Kim's murder.

28:36.149 --> 28:37.498
Any idea where it went?

28:37.541 --> 28:38.542
Nope.

28:38.586 --> 28:40.675
It's not mine.
I don't work out.

28:40.719 --> 28:42.372
Ah.
Everything you see

28:42.416 --> 28:44.157
is God-given.
LUCIFER:
And they say that

28:44.200 --> 28:45.811
Dad doesn't give
with both hands.

28:45.854 --> 28:46.942
So, the dumbbell.

28:46.986 --> 28:48.074
You're saying that's Kim's?

28:48.117 --> 28:49.379
Yeah. Poor thing

28:49.423 --> 28:51.425
tried so hard to be like me.

28:51.468 --> 28:53.340
So how did it feel
when you realized

28:53.383 --> 28:54.863
that Benji preferred Kim to you?

28:54.907 --> 28:56.517
Nuh, uh-uh-uh. Sneaky.

28:56.560 --> 28:58.301
Don't listen
to the detective, darling.

28:58.345 --> 28:59.825
She's trying
to trick you.

28:59.868 --> 29:01.130
You just look
into my eyes

29:01.174 --> 29:03.785
so we can prove to her
that she's wrong.

29:03.829 --> 29:06.222
Now, you're too sophisticated

29:06.266 --> 29:09.051
to care about your boring
flatmate's trifles, aren't you?

29:09.095 --> 29:11.924
Tell me, what is it
that you really desire?

29:11.967 --> 29:14.404
I...

29:14.448 --> 29:16.319
I...

29:16.363 --> 29:17.756
Yeah.

29:17.799 --> 29:19.758
...want to...

29:19.801 --> 29:22.630
stop posing and lying!

29:23.762 --> 29:24.980
It takes so much effort

29:25.024 --> 29:27.461
to make these pics look
so effortless.

29:27.504 --> 29:28.767
It's exhausting!

29:28.810 --> 29:30.464
Well, so you're saying
it's just all a facade?

29:30.507 --> 29:33.119
I don't even know
what that word means!

29:33.162 --> 29:35.512
I'm not worldly at all!

29:38.864 --> 29:41.431
#Barbados?

29:41.475 --> 29:42.476
More like

29:42.519 --> 29:43.782
#Bogus.

29:43.825 --> 29:44.870
The most exotic place

29:44.913 --> 29:46.567
I've ever been
is the gym's sauna.

29:46.610 --> 29:48.612
But you said
you didn't work out.

29:48.656 --> 29:50.397
Of course I do.

29:50.440 --> 29:53.008
With real equipment,
at a gym,

29:53.052 --> 29:54.444
not in my living room.

29:54.488 --> 29:56.490
So you're still saying
that the dumbbell is Kim's?

29:56.533 --> 30:00.711
Yeah. She tried everything to be
part of my glamorous lifestyle.

30:00.755 --> 30:02.931
She was even planning
on getting surgery

30:02.975 --> 30:04.454
once all the money came in.

30:04.498 --> 30:05.586
What money?

30:05.629 --> 30:06.717
I don't know,

30:06.761 --> 30:08.676
but she made it sound
life-changing.

30:09.633 --> 30:10.939
CHLOE:
Maybe the motive

30:10.983 --> 30:12.462
for Kim's murder
was financial.

30:12.506 --> 30:14.421
Maybe she was coming
into some inheritance,

30:14.464 --> 30:16.162
and someone wasn't
happy about it.

30:16.205 --> 30:18.381
I can't believe
Esther was a fake.

30:18.425 --> 30:20.296
I mean, how did I
completely misjudge her?

30:20.340 --> 30:21.471
Lucifer, are you listening?

30:21.515 --> 30:23.169
We need to look
into this windfall.

30:23.212 --> 30:24.431
Detective, I think

30:24.474 --> 30:26.215
I've been spending too
much time with you.

30:26.259 --> 30:27.869
It's turned my
top hat radar rusty.

30:27.913 --> 30:30.263
What?
But no offense,
but I think I need

30:30.306 --> 30:31.960
to go and hang out with
some interesting people

30:32.004 --> 30:33.614
before you turn
me into a shoe.

30:38.575 --> 30:40.708
[seagulls squawking,
waves crashing]

30:46.888 --> 30:48.063
I'm sorry.
Mm.

30:48.107 --> 30:49.891
I don't regret meeting you.

30:49.935 --> 30:52.198
I just...
It's a lot.

30:52.241 --> 30:54.940
I've calmed down now,
so can we go?

30:54.983 --> 30:57.290
Lie down with me, Linda.

30:57.333 --> 30:59.466
On the... on the sand?

31:00.946 --> 31:02.469
Oh, okay.

31:05.080 --> 31:06.777
[seagulls squawking]

31:06.821 --> 31:08.867
Listen,

31:08.910 --> 31:12.653
there was a time when I, too,
thought that I knew everything.

31:12.696 --> 31:18.093
This was... this was back
when I was an angel

31:18.137 --> 31:22.054
and spent all my time
looking down on the world.

31:24.012 --> 31:25.709
But, you see, I found

31:25.753 --> 31:28.103
that it takes looking up
to gain perspective.

31:28.147 --> 31:29.975
It's a good reminder
of just how much

31:30.018 --> 31:32.107
there is that we don't know.

31:32.151 --> 31:34.370
Linda...

31:34.414 --> 31:38.940
if you really
think about it...

31:38.984 --> 31:41.856
do you have any fewer
questions than you used to?

31:41.900 --> 31:43.466
When you didn't know?

31:43.510 --> 31:46.469
I mean, they're...
they're different questions,

31:46.513 --> 31:48.384
but there are just
as many, maybe more.

31:48.428 --> 31:49.603
So you're still every bit

31:49.646 --> 31:51.561
the clueless idiot
that you always were?

31:51.605 --> 31:54.216
[both laughing]

31:56.175 --> 31:57.916
[sighs]

31:57.959 --> 32:00.179
That helps.

32:02.181 --> 32:05.445
Still sucks about
the chameleon, though.

32:05.488 --> 32:08.448
[laughs]

32:14.889 --> 32:16.369
Thank you.

32:16.412 --> 32:18.545
[seagulls squawking]

32:24.072 --> 32:27.075
I can't find any sign
of that windfall.

32:27.119 --> 32:30.339
As far as I can tell, there was
no money coming Kim's way.

32:30.383 --> 32:31.950
Oh, there's got
to be something.

32:31.993 --> 32:32.994
There is.

32:33.038 --> 32:35.388
Charlotte,
what are you doing here?

32:35.431 --> 32:37.999
I felt unsettled
about lying to you.

32:38.043 --> 32:41.437
Um, I thought I could make up
for it by making myself useful.

32:41.481 --> 32:45.528
So, I overheard you talking
about finding a connection

32:45.572 --> 32:47.878
between the dead girl
and that exclusive dating app.

32:47.922 --> 32:50.403
So I did a little digging,
and I found one...

32:50.446 --> 32:52.318
Well, we're long past that.Are you sure?

32:52.361 --> 32:54.015
I had to pull some strings
to get this.

32:54.059 --> 32:56.191
It's an employment
contract

32:56.235 --> 32:58.106
between Kim
and the owner of the app,

32:58.150 --> 32:59.368
Mack something.

32:59.412 --> 33:02.154
Drawn up two years ago
in total secrecy.

33:02.197 --> 33:04.286
But Mack said
that he hadn't met Kim

33:04.330 --> 33:05.984
until she called him that night.

33:06.027 --> 33:07.333
Oh, he met her, all right.

33:07.376 --> 33:08.812
Kim hiredhim.

33:08.856 --> 33:10.118
She hired him?

33:10.162 --> 33:12.686
And then hacked his app?
It doesn't make sense.

33:12.729 --> 33:13.817
Unless...

33:13.861 --> 33:15.297
she didn't hack it.

33:15.341 --> 33:19.171
Top Meet's encryption protocol
is impossible to crack.

33:19.214 --> 33:21.042
Except to the person
who built it.

33:21.086 --> 33:22.087
Exactly.

33:22.130 --> 33:24.089
So, if Kim created Top Meet,

33:24.132 --> 33:25.786
then who the hell is Mack?

33:25.829 --> 33:28.223
[sighs]:
Well, no computer whiz,
that's for sure.

33:28.267 --> 33:29.485
C-minus student,

33:29.529 --> 33:31.487
barely graduated
high school.

33:31.531 --> 33:33.837
Voted Most Likely
to Sleep His Way to the Top.

33:33.881 --> 33:36.144
And guess what he was
doing before Top Meet.

33:36.188 --> 33:37.493
Spin instructor.

33:37.537 --> 33:39.495
Okay, wh-why would Kim
hire him, though,

33:39.539 --> 33:41.497
if she's this genius
computer engineer?

33:41.541 --> 33:43.325
What does he bring
to the equation?

33:43.369 --> 33:45.197
Uh... that.

33:45.240 --> 33:47.373
Look at him
and then look at her.

33:47.416 --> 33:48.591
If both came to you

33:48.635 --> 33:50.463
asking for funding for
an elite dating app,

33:50.506 --> 33:51.986
whose project
would you invest in?

33:52.030 --> 33:54.336
Well, yeah, if you're being
all superfish and whatevs.

33:54.380 --> 33:55.729
CHLOE:
Which many people are.

33:55.772 --> 33:58.688
Maybe Kim felt she wasn't
fancy-schmancy enough,

33:58.732 --> 34:00.821
so she hid the fact
that she was the creator,

34:00.864 --> 34:03.867
and hired pretty boy Mack here
to be the facade.

34:03.911 --> 34:06.653
In secret. Explains
why it didn't come up

34:06.696 --> 34:09.134
in the background check.So Kim's insecurities

34:09.177 --> 34:10.265
allowed Mack to take the credit.

34:10.309 --> 34:12.180
And the money.

34:12.224 --> 34:13.964
Which she wanted
to take back.

34:14.008 --> 34:16.141
That's the windfall
she was expecting.

34:16.184 --> 34:17.533
It's a strong motive
for him to kill her.

34:17.577 --> 34:19.405
Yeah, but didn't his
alibi check out?He could have

34:19.448 --> 34:22.277
easily convinced one of his
employees to lie for him.

34:22.321 --> 34:24.410
It's a solid theory,
but still,

34:24.453 --> 34:26.673
it's just a theory--
we need proof.[sighs]

34:26.716 --> 34:28.414
I really wish we had
that murderous dumbbell

34:28.457 --> 34:30.111
right about now.Well, if Mack did it,

34:30.155 --> 34:32.722
I think we know
where to find it.Hmm? We do?

34:32.766 --> 34:33.854
Uh, there's a good chance

34:33.897 --> 34:35.682
the murder weapon
is at Mack's place.

34:35.725 --> 34:37.945
Seasoned killers know
to leave it at the scene,

34:37.988 --> 34:40.295
but first-timers,
they tend to take it with them.

34:40.339 --> 34:44.256
I can't count the times I've
allegedly helped a client unmake

34:44.299 --> 34:46.040
that mistake.

34:46.084 --> 34:47.128
Really?

34:47.172 --> 34:49.870
What? I said "allegedly."

34:49.913 --> 34:52.394
We need to get a search warrant
for Mack's place.

34:52.438 --> 34:54.657
Yeah, good luck with that.Excuse me?

34:54.701 --> 34:56.920
Mack's lawyer will argue
that all you have is conjecture

34:56.964 --> 34:58.357
based on circumstantial
evidence,

34:58.400 --> 34:59.749
and any judge will agree.

34:59.793 --> 35:01.708
You're never getting
that warrant.

35:01.751 --> 35:06.104
Well, then it's a good thing
I am exactlyour killer's type.

35:08.149 --> 35:10.891
Mack! I lovethe place.

35:10.934 --> 35:12.110
Mr. Morningstar.

35:12.153 --> 35:14.895
How about
a gentlemen's weekend in Vegas?

35:14.938 --> 35:17.289
I need to scrape the rust
off my playboy ways, and you're

35:17.332 --> 35:18.594
just the chap to help this Devil

35:18.638 --> 35:20.205
get his groove back.
What do you say?

35:20.248 --> 35:22.120
[chuckles]
That sounds fun.

35:22.163 --> 35:23.338
Yeah.Uh...

35:23.382 --> 35:26.820
but I'm afraid I have
a previous engagement.

35:26.863 --> 35:28.648
Oh?

35:31.868 --> 35:33.783
[clears throat]

35:37.744 --> 35:40.312
Some alone time
with the detective?

35:40.355 --> 35:42.575
Not alone anymore.Oh, Mack.

35:42.618 --> 35:44.925
I suppose we all have
our low points.

35:44.968 --> 35:46.144
But not to worry,

35:46.187 --> 35:48.058
I've got a chopper waiting--
if we leave now,

35:48.102 --> 35:49.625
we can still make the
Encore pool party.
