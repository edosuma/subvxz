00:00.934 --> 00:02.267
<i>Previously on "Alias":</i>

00:02.268 --> 00:04.136
- Who are you?
- Your mother's sister.

00:04.137 --> 00:05.938
Katya.

00:05.939 --> 00:08.737
- What about him?
- Kill him.

00:10.443 --> 00:12.845
No one wants Lauren in custody
more than I do.

00:12.846 --> 00:14.880
That's not the kind of closure
I'm referring to.

00:14.881 --> 00:16.482
This is the key to my storage facility.

00:16.483 --> 00:21.147
In it you'll find disposal facilities
capable of dealing with her remains.

00:21.221 --> 00:23.781
<i>According to Sloane.
Nadia will be injected with a fluid</i>

00:23.857 --> 00:26.382
<i>that will enable her
to deliver a message:</i>

00:26.459 --> 00:29.360
<i>Sloane believes that his daughter
will serve as a direct conduit</i>

00:29.429 --> 00:31.989
<i>to the consciousness
of Milo Rambaldi:</i>

00:32.064 --> 00:34.233
- Get away from her.
- Sydney, please.

00:34.234 --> 00:36.734
Now!

00:38.972 --> 00:41.668
Sloane, we gotta go.
Now! Go!

00:41.741 --> 00:46.007
You're safe. I promise you
he'll never hurt you again.

00:46.079 --> 00:51.073
She drew an equation,
coordinates that would lead to a place.

00:51.151 --> 00:53.676
What place?
What are we supposed to find there?

00:53.753 --> 00:56.253
Rambaldi.

00:58.000 --> 01:04.074

01:06.699 --> 01:09.199
Good evening, Miss Bristow.

01:58.151 --> 02:00.651
Hey, Syd.

02:06.860 --> 02:09.026
Where do we stand
with Rambaldi's equation?

02:09.027 --> 02:12.794
- How close are you to solving it?
- Uh, I only recovered about 92%.

02:12.866 --> 02:17.633
I've designed a program to extrapolate the
rest, but these permutations are, like, vast.

02:17.704 --> 02:20.605
It seems to be written
in some sort of pre-Galilean algebra,

02:20.673 --> 02:24.507
which, you know, kinda makes you
think these guys were, you know...

02:24.577 --> 02:27.077
you know, back in the...

02:27.780 --> 02:30.908
- Should be about eight hours.
- Let me know the moment it's done.

02:30.984 --> 02:37.719
Absolutely. Actually, sir, do you mind
if I ask, what exactly are we looking for?

02:37.790 --> 02:41.817
Our only intel came from the
interrogation of Dr. Lee in Havana.

02:41.895 --> 02:45.558
Crazy as it sounds,
he says we're looking for Rambaldi.

02:46.432 --> 02:48.500
Rambaldi.

02:48.501 --> 02:51.937
As in Mr. R...
from the...

02:52.005 --> 02:55.600
You know, I don't even wanna know. I
don't even wanna... I got too much on my...

02:55.675 --> 02:58.143
With the baby.
Well, he's, like, a toddler.

02:58.144 --> 03:02.308
- And Carrie's constantly... even when I'm...
- I understand.

03:09.088 --> 03:11.588
I'm gonna...

03:16.963 --> 03:20.694
<i>I'm in.
Patching into the feed now.</i>

03:25.705 --> 03:29.766
I must say, your disguise,
it addresses a certain proclivity of mine.

03:29.842 --> 03:33.539
<i>If this works. I'll happily make
your sick little fantasy come true:</i>

03:40.420 --> 03:42.487
Uploading Rambaldi's equation now.

03:45.592 --> 03:47.125
Oh. Hey, Syd.

03:47.126 --> 03:51.825
<i>Uh, listen, have you seen a USB key
with a Speed Racer logo on it?</i>

03:51.898 --> 03:55.527
It just happens to have every single
picture we've ever taken of Mitchell on it.

03:55.602 --> 04:00.972
Well, I brought it in here
to make duplicates, and, of course,

04:01.040 --> 04:03.540
genius that I am,
I forgot to make a backup copy.

04:03.610 --> 04:06.841
I'll tell you something,
Carrie's gonna kill me if I don't find it.

04:06.913 --> 04:11.316
Ah, found it. It was in the...
when I was doing the keyboard earlier.

04:11.384 --> 04:15.047
It's a good thing I found it,
'cause Carrie'd probably divorce me if I...

04:15.121 --> 04:20.081
Thing is, I'd probably divorce myself
in the process, you know.

04:20.159 --> 04:25.222
Is that a new perfume you're wearing,
'cause it's nice. I like it.

04:29.836 --> 04:32.396
Why are you downloading
the equation?

04:38.011 --> 04:41.003
I have it.
Corrupting the database now.

04:57.497 --> 05:00.864
- Activate countermeasures now.
- Head down, love.

05:05.271 --> 05:07.472
Sydney!

05:07.473 --> 05:09.973
Call 911, Mr. Vaughn.

05:16.616 --> 05:19.116
We have a level-five...

05:31.998 --> 05:35.399
The evacuation protocol
is overriding the lockdown!

05:39.505 --> 05:42.497
Marshall! We need a medic. Call St John's.
Tell them we have incoming.

05:42.575 --> 05:44.810
God! Marshall?

05:44.811 --> 05:46.311
They hacked into an off-site relay

05:46.312 --> 05:48.747
in a parking structure
on the northeast corner of 6th.

05:48.748 --> 05:51.444
This is Jack Bristow.
We have a location on one of the intruders.

05:52.652 --> 05:56.315
Keep moving.
You have a clear path for the exit.

05:58.691 --> 06:01.191
Syd, wait!

06:43.536 --> 06:46.036
You all right?

07:46.966 --> 07:50.527
The name's Hank Foster,
Counterterrorist Threat Analysis.

07:51.737 --> 07:53.905
What am I doing here, Mr. Foster?

07:53.906 --> 07:56.466
At 7:22 this evening,
you were logged in at the safe house

07:56.542 --> 07:58.510
where Nadia Santos is being held.

07:58.511 --> 08:01.011
Is that accurate?

08:02.482 --> 08:06.009
It was around dinner.
I brought her a sandwich.

08:06.085 --> 08:10.522
- Where were you before that?
- Buying her the sandwich.

08:11.424 --> 08:13.924
What is this?

08:16.095 --> 08:18.689
At 6:12 tonight,
the rotunda was compromised.

08:18.764 --> 08:21.358
What?
How is that...?

08:23.536 --> 08:26.036
You tell me.

08:40.453 --> 08:42.953
Oh, my God.

08:43.856 --> 08:46.723
Is he OK?

08:46.792 --> 08:49.761
Was any...
Was anyone killed?

08:50.530 --> 08:54.261
It would do you good
if you had an alibi.

09:11.484 --> 09:16.080
I used the key you gave me. I took
the suitcase. I'm prepared to use it.

09:16.155 --> 09:19.750
When the agency concludes,
as they will, that Lauren was responsible,

09:19.825 --> 09:23.317
the pressure to capture her
will rise exponentially.

09:23.396 --> 09:27.389
The disposal project we discussed
must be anonymous.

09:27.466 --> 09:32.062
Once her status changes,
that will be more difficult.

09:32.138 --> 09:34.506
Sark isn't talking.

09:34.507 --> 09:37.908
He hasn't requested counsel,
not even so much as a glass of water.

09:37.977 --> 09:39.844
May I suggest you have
Vaughn talk with him?

09:39.845 --> 09:42.405
Given their personal history,
I'm not sure that's advisable.

09:42.481 --> 09:47.350
Sark undoubtedly will be more afraid
to face a man he so recently tortured.

09:47.420 --> 09:49.554
Given his pattern
for caving out of fear,

09:49.555 --> 09:55.494
I believe Vaughn's presence will more
likely yield the results we're looking for.

10:00.066 --> 10:05.868
As the director, I can't sanction
the beating of someone in our custody.

10:05.938 --> 10:10.466
Understood. I'll apprise you of any intel
that comes from his interrogation.

10:30.630 --> 10:35.533
Last time we were together,
our roles were reversed.

10:35.601 --> 10:40.595
- Funny how things happen.
- I'm afraid the irony is lost on me.

10:43.843 --> 10:48.246
You like the electric batons
and the injections.

10:48.314 --> 10:51.010
I'm not into accessories.

10:51.083 --> 10:53.916
I'm more than willing to cooperate,
Mr. Vaughn.

10:53.986 --> 10:58.889
I will tell you everything you want,
but I will need something in return.

10:58.958 --> 11:02.416
- No deals.
- Well, then, it seems we're at an impasse.

11:02.495 --> 11:08.559
I assure you, it won't take Lauren long
to solve Rambaldi's equation.

11:08.634 --> 11:11.134
Well, better get started, then.

11:13.239 --> 11:15.739
Where is Lauren Reed?

11:19.211 --> 11:22.180
I understand your suspicion.

11:23.315 --> 11:28.719
But we both know that whatever was
taken, I probably had access to it,

11:28.788 --> 11:32.189
and if Marshall had it,
I could have just asked him.

11:34.160 --> 11:39.291
It was a Covenant raid.
They got the Rambaldi equation.

11:39.365 --> 11:41.865
We apprehended Julian Sark.

11:44.203 --> 11:47.297
- I think I broke it.
- Clearly.

11:47.373 --> 11:49.873
You ready to talk?

11:53.045 --> 11:55.545
Yes.

11:59.118 --> 12:05.023
When I first learned of your wife's true
allegiance, I almost felt pity for you.

12:05.091 --> 12:07.225
How embarrassing it must have been

12:07.226 --> 12:10.161
to learn that the woman you shared
your bed with was only using you

12:10.229 --> 12:12.993
as an unfortunate means to an end.

12:13.065 --> 12:14.365
I wouldn't do this if I were you.

12:14.366 --> 12:17.824
<i>But, then, she wasn't sharing
your bed lately, was she?</i>

12:17.903 --> 12:20.531
She was in mine.

12:21.941 --> 12:24.441
Or in my car.

12:25.678 --> 12:29.011
Or an elevator.
Or a garage.

12:30.349 --> 12:33.546
There was this one time,
this is my favorite,

12:33.619 --> 12:36.554
when we were engaged
in an alley,

12:36.622 --> 12:40.285
and she called you
to tell you she loved you.

12:41.260 --> 12:44.252
That woman was deliciously filthy.

12:46.398 --> 12:48.767
Do you feel that?

12:48.768 --> 12:52.135
It feels like a knife
slicing through you, doesn't it?

12:52.204 --> 12:54.439
Now, where is she?

12:54.440 --> 12:58.843
Lauren was working for the Covenant
the entire time she was NSC liaison.

12:58.911 --> 13:03.177
Her codes have been revoked but she
would still know our security protocols.

13:03.249 --> 13:06.582
This is the person you're looking for.

13:11.423 --> 13:13.923
Let's talk about your sister.

13:14.927 --> 13:17.427
The equation...

13:18.230 --> 13:21.063
the part taken from the rotunda...

13:22.268 --> 13:25.135
was implanted
in your sister's subconscious?

13:25.204 --> 13:30.335
Not literally.
It's more of a genetic inheritance.

13:30.409 --> 13:34.539
- An inheritance from Rambaldi?
- My sister is innocent.

13:34.613 --> 13:36.781
Rambaldi refers to you
as the Chosen One,

13:36.782 --> 13:40.343
he implants in your sister's head the
whereabouts of his greatest invention,

13:40.419 --> 13:43.513
and you expect me to believe that
neither one of you is involved in this?

13:43.589 --> 13:46.752
I don't care what you believe.

13:46.826 --> 13:49.989
This is a waste of time.

13:55.501 --> 13:58.265
Last week Ms. Santos
was in the custody of the Covenant.

13:58.337 --> 14:00.171
As a prisoner they nearly killed.

14:00.172 --> 14:02.106
If Lauren Reed broke in
using your identity,

14:02.107 --> 14:05.474
she would need to be sure
you were out of the office.

14:05.544 --> 14:08.274
Did your sister call you
to come see her?

14:09.782 --> 14:12.444
If you wanna arrest me...

14:14.854 --> 14:17.482
hold me under the Patriot Act.

14:18.624 --> 14:21.124
We're through talking.

14:23.162 --> 14:28.498
The DCI will have my preliminary
findings on his desk in 48 hours.

14:28.567 --> 14:34.062
Until that time, you will be reassigned
as a desk officer. You may go.

14:41.647 --> 14:45.344
I'm not gonna kill you.
That would be too easy.

14:45.417 --> 14:47.917
But I'll leave you so disfigured
that when you walk down the street,

14:47.953 --> 14:50.021
people will pity you.

14:50.022 --> 14:54.356
Lauren is gonna pay for the damage
she's done to the people I care about,

14:54.426 --> 14:56.494
not for having had an affair with you.

14:56.495 --> 15:00.158
I don't give a rat's ass
who she's sleeping with.

15:00.232 --> 15:03.258
So, for the last time,
where is she?

15:27.059 --> 15:29.789
- How is Marshall?
- He's still in the OR.

15:30.696 --> 15:33.494
18 agents taken to St John's.
12 treated and released.

15:33.565 --> 15:36.500
Four being held overnight
for observation.

15:36.568 --> 15:40.299
And Brandon's not gonna make it
out of the ICU.

15:40.372 --> 15:42.740
It just makes me sick.

15:42.741 --> 15:44.575
Where's Vaughn?

15:44.576 --> 15:46.377
I haven't seen him
since he finished interrogating Sark,

15:46.378 --> 15:49.176
but, uh, word is
he worked him over pretty good.

15:49.248 --> 15:53.685
Didn't get any information out of him,
but it had to feel pretty good trying.

15:53.752 --> 15:56.550
I'm sure he'll be back soon.
Probably needed to walk it off.

15:56.622 --> 15:59.352
Eric said you took off.
Need some company?

15:59.425 --> 16:01.925
No, I'm good.

16:03.028 --> 16:05.553
<i>- Where are you?
- It doesn't matter.</i>

16:05.631 --> 16:08.131
What does that mean?

16:09.068 --> 16:11.568
Vaughn, what's going on?

16:17.076 --> 16:20.842
Sark talked, didn't he?
And you know where Lauren is.

16:20.913 --> 16:23.314
I'm taking care of it.

16:23.315 --> 16:26.682
I don't know what you're thinking,
but you cannot do this, Michael.

16:26.752 --> 16:32.452
If you kill her, you will be arrested
and charged with her murder.

16:33.092 --> 16:38.928
<i>And if you're not. If you get away with it.
It'll haunt you. Michael:</i>

16:38.998 --> 16:44.937
God, after everything we've been through,
I'll lose you all over again.

16:45.004 --> 16:47.504
I have to go.

17:23.208 --> 17:26.176
<i>Are you sure
the computation is exact?</i>

17:26.244 --> 17:28.839
It's all good.

17:28.914 --> 17:31.439
<i>Andiamo a vedere:</i>

17:31.517 --> 17:34.645
<i>Andiamo. Ragazzina: Bene:</i>

17:35.220 --> 17:36.988
<i>Bravo:</i>

17:36.989 --> 17:44.589
Someone went through a lot of hoo-ha
to encrypt a longitude and a latitude.

17:49.301 --> 17:51.369
What the hell is in Palermo?

17:51.370 --> 17:56.205
You're paid to be discreet,
not curious.

17:57.342 --> 18:00.607
It's OK, beautiful.
This will keep my mouth shut.

18:00.679 --> 18:03.671
So will this.

18:35.814 --> 18:38.314
Hi, honey.

18:45.524 --> 18:48.857
I need the tape from
the Sark interrogation.

18:51.697 --> 18:54.257
- Actually, that's been classified.
- By who?

18:54.333 --> 18:56.833
Jack Bristow.

19:10.449 --> 19:12.517
- I want that tape.
- No, you don't.

19:12.518 --> 19:14.418
Not if you want
what's best for Vaughn.

19:14.419 --> 19:16.254
You know what he's gonna do
if we don't stop him.

19:16.255 --> 19:18.755
Yes, he'll get closure.

19:20.058 --> 19:21.759
You want him to kill Lauren.

19:21.760 --> 19:25.753
If he doesn't,
it will eat at him like a cancer.

19:25.831 --> 19:28.425
The only cure is to end it now.

19:28.500 --> 19:33.733
<i>- She destroyed Vaughn's life:
- Vaughn's life. Not yours:</i>

19:33.805 --> 19:37.866
This is about what Lauren did to Vaughn,
not what Mom did to you.

19:37.943 --> 19:42.277
<i>I don't know what you've told him or how
much of all this you've orchestrated.</i>

19:42.347 --> 19:47.444
But in some twisted way you've got
Vaughn carrying your burden,

19:47.519 --> 19:53.082
trying to get you closure, by doing the
one thing you never had the chance to do:

19:53.158 --> 19:55.658
Kill the person who betrayed you.

19:55.661 --> 20:00.064
I did have the chance...
and I didn't take it.

20:02.301 --> 20:07.170
<i>And not a day went by
that I didn't regret letting her go:</i>

20:09.374 --> 20:13.708
<i>Vaughn will feel the same way:
He will end up like me:</i>

20:14.613 --> 20:19.607
And I love you too much
to let that happen.

20:40.706 --> 20:42.573
Michael.

20:42.574 --> 20:45.771
Please, I need you to understand.

20:45.844 --> 20:49.041
When the Covenant
tasked me to marry you,

20:49.114 --> 20:52.811
I knew eventually they wanted me
to coax you back into the CIA.

20:52.884 --> 20:57.617
But two years went by
and I hadn't heard from them.

20:57.689 --> 21:02.023
And by then I'd convinced myself
I never would.

21:03.695 --> 21:08.064
I prayed I wouldn't.
Because I'd fallen in love with you.

21:08.133 --> 21:10.633
Shut up!

21:11.937 --> 21:17.466
I am gonna erase you. I'm gonna
remove any evidence you ever existed.

21:17.542 --> 21:21.808
You used me.
You used my grief, my work, who I am.

21:21.880 --> 21:25.145
You took that from me.
I'm taking it back.

21:27.452 --> 21:32.754
This is hydrochloric acid.
You'll be unrecognizable.

21:32.824 --> 21:36.760
Michael, I swear
I was gonna tell you everything.

21:37.462 --> 21:40.954
You remember that night
we went downtown and had dinner?

21:41.033 --> 21:43.200
- Instead you told me Sydney was back.
- Don't say her name!

21:43.201 --> 21:46.261
She came back
and you didn't need me anymore.

21:46.338 --> 21:49.830
I could see it in your eyes.
Sydney came back and...

21:49.908 --> 21:52.502
- I said don't say her name!
- Sydney came back and I lost you.

22:03.855 --> 22:06.157
I hate you.

22:06.158 --> 22:13.064
But I love Sydney more. That's the
only reason you're not dying tonight.

22:26.645 --> 22:29.145
Thank God.

22:41.626 --> 22:43.227
Sh! Sh!

22:43.228 --> 22:45.728
Quiet. Listen to me.

22:45.764 --> 22:48.858
This device I'm wearing on my wrist
is masking my heat signature.

22:48.934 --> 22:52.734
I have three minutes before
the thermal imagers detect a malfunction.

22:52.804 --> 22:57.969
I trust that you will allow me that time
before you alert the guards.

22:59.878 --> 23:01.946
What are you doing here?

23:01.947 --> 23:05.405
You received your last dose
of the Rambaldi fluid.

23:05.484 --> 23:10.217
I saw you begin to draw, which means
you know where the Rambaldi artifact is.

23:10.288 --> 23:15.351
Now, I gather you never told the CIA. That
is wise, Nadia. They cannot be trusted.

23:15.427 --> 23:18.726
You expect me to trust you
after what you put me through?

23:18.797 --> 23:21.664
It was all in an effort
to pave the way for us.

23:21.733 --> 23:25.499
Rambaldi wrote about this vessel in which
he was able to house his consciousness,

23:25.570 --> 23:27.805
his essence, his soul.

23:27.806 --> 23:33.039
He referred to it as the Sphere of Life.
Now you and I can claim it together.

23:33.111 --> 23:35.479
Your beliefs are your own.

23:35.480 --> 23:39.473
I understand your skepticism,
but tell me this.

23:39.551 --> 23:43.612
When you were under the influence
of the Rambaldi fluid, what you saw,

23:43.688 --> 23:45.790
was it not transcendent?

23:45.791 --> 23:48.385
Was it not divine?

23:51.029 --> 23:54.328
Yes, it was.

23:54.399 --> 23:56.899
I can see it in your eyes.

23:59.171 --> 24:04.199
You have 20 seconds before the guards
detect you. You should go, now.

24:04.276 --> 24:08.645
I'm leaving you instructions
on how to find me. I pray you use it.

24:17.088 --> 24:18.956
- Vaughn!
- What have we got?

24:18.957 --> 24:21.517
- 35-year-old, stab wound to the back.
- Vaughn.

24:21.593 --> 24:24.892
The respiration's at 18
and tachycardia at 125.

24:24.963 --> 24:27.463
You are gonna be OK.
Vaughn.

24:42.814 --> 24:45.510
I heard.
Is he still in surgery?

24:45.584 --> 24:49.042
You were right.
Lauren has to pay.

24:49.120 --> 24:54.251
Vaughn is gonna be OK.
And when he is, he has to end it, not you.

24:54.326 --> 24:56.851
If it's OK for Vaughn,
it's OK for me.

24:58.497 --> 25:02.365
I need your help.
Expedited credentials, transportation...

25:02.434 --> 25:05.835
My advice was specific
to her betrayal of him.

25:05.904 --> 25:09.431
- Lauren betrayed all of us.
- Not in the same way.

25:09.508 --> 25:12.008
She was his wife.

25:13.211 --> 25:15.941
I don't care about
any of that now.

25:17.549 --> 25:20.049
I want her to die.

25:20.986 --> 25:24.945
And that's gonna happen
whether you help me or not.

26:02.827 --> 26:07.855
When I went to meet your contact,
Vaughn was there.

26:10.368 --> 26:13.235
He was your contact.
You set the meeting.

26:14.072 --> 26:16.597
Did you give me up?

26:21.479 --> 26:24.073
It's OK.

26:24.149 --> 26:26.649
I would have told them, too.

26:32.023 --> 26:35.015
Let me see what
they've done to you.

26:44.336 --> 26:48.329
My mother's hired a lawyer.
He'll be here soon.

26:50.342 --> 26:53.106
The only way
we can get the location

26:53.178 --> 26:57.444
is if I tell him how to access
your contact's information.

26:57.515 --> 27:00.678
He backs up everything
on an off-site server.

27:00.752 --> 27:05.917
- Tell me you know the pass phrase.
- I do. It's a quote by Friedrich Nietzsche.

27:05.991 --> 27:08.926
- "God is dead. "
- No, the other one.

27:09.761 --> 27:12.423
"Woman was God's second mistake. "

27:16.001 --> 27:18.501
Thank you.

27:25.677 --> 27:29.272
Voice modulator courtesy of
CIA Technical Services.

27:29.347 --> 27:32.976
This little trick of yours
means Vaughn failed.

27:33.051 --> 27:35.551
Tell me, is he dead?

27:36.788 --> 27:41.748
No, he's not. But, thanks to you,
Lauren won't be so lucky.

28:05.650 --> 28:09.711
<i>- The equation leads to Palermo.
- False ID, passport, driver's license.</i>

28:09.788 --> 28:12.156
Plane from Orci Aerospace
is standing by with instructions

28:12.157 --> 28:14.291
to take you wherever you wanna go.

28:14.292 --> 28:16.727
If this is the location
of the Rambaldi artifact,

28:16.728 --> 28:18.829
there will be
a strong Covenant presence.

28:18.830 --> 28:21.330
I'll be careful.

28:22.934 --> 28:25.434
Let me go instead.

28:26.604 --> 28:29.104
I can't.

28:31.943 --> 28:34.443
I'll cover for you with Foster.

28:37.916 --> 28:40.817
What is it?

28:40.885 --> 28:44.150
Nothing.
We'll talk when you get back.

29:59.931 --> 30:02.431
How you doing?

30:14.078 --> 30:17.241
- Where's Sydney?
- Take it easy, take it easy. Easy. Sit back.

30:17.315 --> 30:20.011
Tell me where she is.

30:20.084 --> 30:22.678
- She went after Lauren.
- Oh, no. I have to get her.

30:22.754 --> 30:25.155
No, no, no, no, no.
Mike, you got a punctured lung.

30:25.156 --> 30:27.224
You even breathe wrong,
that thing could collapse again.

30:27.225 --> 30:28.792
- I have to warn her.
- No chance.

30:28.793 --> 30:30.694
There's a guard outside the door.

30:30.695 --> 30:32.896
Foster's got the building
locked down.

30:32.897 --> 30:36.025
He revoked your clearance pending
an investigation of your rogue op.

30:36.100 --> 30:38.168
- You're not going anywhere.
- I have to get to Syd.

30:38.169 --> 30:40.304
- She's walking into a trap.
- What?

30:40.305 --> 30:42.406
What are you talking about?

30:42.407 --> 30:45.376
Lauren didn't stab me.

30:45.443 --> 30:47.611
Katya Derevko did.

30:49.214 --> 30:53.310
Vaughn's flatlining.
I need help in here now.

30:54.185 --> 30:56.685
Pull the covers so I can clear him.

31:00.491 --> 31:02.991
Let's go.

31:04.696 --> 31:06.230
- Freeze!
- You freeze!

31:06.231 --> 31:07.865
- Get down!
- Hope you know what you're doing here.

31:07.866 --> 31:09.800
Put down your weapon.
Put it in the trash can.

31:09.801 --> 31:12.301
Put it down, guys.
Put it down.

31:13.671 --> 31:16.299
Now get in the elevator.

31:19.210 --> 31:20.911
- Get in.
- What?

31:20.912 --> 31:23.412
Get in.

31:26.251 --> 31:28.318
<i>We're trapped in the elevator:</i>

31:28.319 --> 31:30.819
<i>Locking the building down:
On our way up:</i>

31:42.267 --> 31:45.236
Vaughn's going out the front.
All units to the main entrance now.

31:45.303 --> 31:50.104
<i>He's going out the front entrance.
Let's go! Go! Go! Move!</i>

32:08.626 --> 32:11.061
- Katya.
- Sydney.

32:11.062 --> 32:14.498
I could have killed you.
I thought you were a Covenant guard.

32:14.565 --> 32:18.934
- What are you doing here?
- I'm infiltrating the camp, the same as you.

32:19.003 --> 32:23.940
My informant told me the Covenant had
been transporting excavation equipment.

32:24.008 --> 32:28.172
I thought they might have a lead
on the Rambaldi artifact.

32:28.246 --> 32:30.447
Have you seen Lauren?
Is she here?

32:30.448 --> 32:33.440
She was.
She drove away an hour ago.

32:35.186 --> 32:40.283
Then we'll wait till she gets back
before we make our move.

32:40.358 --> 32:43.919
Covenant agents have been patrolling
up here. We'd better take cover.

32:43.995 --> 32:46.495
- Are you alone?
- Yes.

32:57.108 --> 32:59.343
How did you know?

32:59.344 --> 33:02.939
I didn't.
And now I do.

33:29.841 --> 33:33.868
We have already hit subsoil,
hard clay.

33:34.445 --> 33:36.380
If the artifact is any deeper,

33:36.381 --> 33:39.578
we will need ground-penetrating radar
to narrow the search grid.

33:39.650 --> 33:44.383
Then do it.
If the artifact is here, I want it found.

33:44.455 --> 33:46.955
<i>Va bene:
Andiamo:</i>

33:51.062 --> 33:55.294
Hey, Nadia!
We're ordering Chinese. Game?

34:04.809 --> 34:07.309
Nadia?

34:08.813 --> 34:10.746
Nadia.

34:10.748 --> 34:12.849
Nadia!

34:12.850 --> 34:15.350
Coming in!

34:33.938 --> 34:36.498
The Covenant solved the equation.

34:36.574 --> 34:40.635
The Rambaldi sphere
may already be compromised.

34:42.813 --> 34:48.184
When I was drawing, there were
moments, as the fluid wore off,

34:48.252 --> 34:51.187
I altered the equation.

34:51.255 --> 34:54.815
I didn't want to give you
what you were looking for.

34:54.891 --> 34:59.659
Which means the Covenant
has the wrong coordinates.

34:59.730 --> 35:03.564
They're looking for the sphere
in the wrong place.

35:03.634 --> 35:08.469
We should go.
We have a long journey ahead of us.

35:10.441 --> 35:12.941
Come.

35:40.304 --> 35:42.804
Guess who.

36:16.641 --> 36:18.708
If you kill me,
you'll never know the truth.

36:18.709 --> 36:22.145
This is the truth.
Sucks, doesn't it?

36:26.918 --> 36:29.614
Do you think the CIA couldn't find you
when you went missing?

36:29.687 --> 36:32.850
Or that you learned
what happened to you by chance?

36:37.228 --> 36:39.728
And if your mother's really been
helping you since she left,

36:39.730 --> 36:43.359
- why haven't you ever spoken to her?
- You're trying to buy time.

36:45.069 --> 36:49.301
You can't believe that you and your sister
just happen to both be agents!

36:49.373 --> 36:51.873
This isn't gonna work.

36:53.678 --> 36:57.341
There's a bank in Wittenberg,
a numbered vault. Proof.

37:06.057 --> 37:08.557
We're both pawns in the same game.

37:08.626 --> 37:11.891
The difference between us
is I know who controls me.

37:11.963 --> 37:15.399
- Who controls me?
- I guess you'll never know.

37:17.501 --> 37:20.001
<i>Stop!</i>

37:20.771 --> 37:22.706
- Let her go.
- Put the gun down.

37:22.707 --> 37:25.972
- Do it now!
- Put the gun down!

37:26.043 --> 37:28.773
If you love her,
you'll put the gun down.

37:36.020 --> 37:38.520
You really are a boy scout.

37:46.764 --> 37:49.264
Vaughn.

37:55.039 --> 37:58.133
What are you doing?
How did you get here?

37:58.209 --> 38:00.709
I came for you.

38:18.696 --> 38:21.756
One, zero, six, two.

38:31.275 --> 38:33.510
What was that?

38:33.511 --> 38:37.174
I don't know.
It doesn't matter.

39:34.405 --> 39:36.473
If you have further questions
about your account,

39:36.474 --> 39:38.408
please feel free to come to my office
when you're finished.

39:38.409 --> 39:40.909
Thank you.

41:24.315 --> 41:27.045
<i>Sydney.</i>

41:27.117 --> 41:30.018
You were never supposed
to have found this.

42:08.492 --> 42:10.992
