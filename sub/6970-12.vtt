WEBVTT

00:02.753 --> 00:04.881
(Siren wailing)

00:12.221 --> 00:17.435
Monongahela. We're en route
with a male cardiac, age 62. Eta in 12.

00:18.311 --> 00:21.522
(Dispatcher) Copy. Eta in 12.
Crash unit standing by.

00:21.606 --> 00:23.774
How's he looking, Leonard?

00:23.858 --> 00:25.943
Up to his ass in alligators.

00:26.027 --> 00:28.112
(Monitor beeping)

00:28.362 --> 00:29.530
(Patient gasping)

00:30.823 --> 00:33.367
- Is he going into arrest?
- No, he's not.

00:43.419 --> 00:46.756
- What did you do?
- Aspirated his chest.

00:47.173 --> 00:51.636
He has a tension pneumothorax pressing
on his heart. Ltjust looked like a cardiac.

00:51.719 --> 00:56.474
- Nice catch. How did you know?
- Because he's dying of cancer.

00:57.850 --> 01:00.019
It's already eaten through one lung.

01:00.102 --> 01:02.688
That's amazing.
How did you know, Leonard?

01:35.096 --> 01:37.181
Leonard?

01:43.938 --> 01:46.023
Leonard?

01:55.449 --> 01:57.535
Leonard?

02:09.170 --> 02:10.506
(Gasps)

02:16.345 --> 02:18.431
Oh, god!

02:19.015 --> 02:20.558
Leonard!

03:00.014 --> 03:01.474
(Thump)

03:09.607 --> 03:11.067
(Thump)

03:15.529 --> 03:16.864
Hello?

03:16.947 --> 03:18.407
(Thump)

05:21.572 --> 05:23.991
Pretty cosy. Who'd ever wanna leave?

05:24.074 --> 05:27.077
Whoever got locked in here
last night, I guess.

05:27.244 --> 05:30.331
That would be one
Leonard Morris betts, age 34.

05:30.414 --> 05:35.336
But it should be noted that when mr betts
arrived here last night he was sans head.

05:35.419 --> 05:37.254
He was decapitated.

05:37.379 --> 05:40.591
He was an emergency medical
technician for this hospital.

05:40.674 --> 05:45.679
- A very good one, apparently.
- What about the morgue attendant?

05:45.763 --> 05:48.599
Somebody cold-cocked him
and stole his clothes.

05:48.724 --> 05:52.436
He didn't see who.
No alarms tripped, no sign of a break-in.

05:52.520 --> 05:55.022
- It's weird, huh?
- What are we doing here?

05:55.105 --> 05:57.233
Did I mention mr betts had no head?

05:57.566 --> 06:01.028
Yes. So? You're not suggesting
that a headless body...

06:01.111 --> 06:04.448
Kicked its way out of a latched
morgue freezer, are you?

06:04.573 --> 06:08.619
Are you? Because I think it's obvious
this is a bizarre attempt at a cover-up.

06:08.786 --> 06:12.122
- Meant to conceal what?
- Body snatching for profit?

06:12.206 --> 06:15.209
There's a shortage of cadavers
at medical schools.

06:15.292 --> 06:18.712
An unscrupulous medical supplier
might pay top dollar.

06:18.796 --> 06:22.216
But why take a headless one and
leave top-dollar bodies behind?

06:22.466 --> 06:26.637
Sir? Those video grabs you asked for.
We found something.

06:28.597 --> 06:33.894
These are from the emergency-room
camera, taken at 4.13 this morning.

06:33.978 --> 06:36.605
There's your perpetrator,
in the stolen uniform.

06:36.814 --> 06:41.318
You can't see very much on these.
What's all this stuff here?

06:41.443 --> 06:45.155
Bad video. The security system
isn't exactly state-ofâ€”the-art.

06:45.239 --> 06:47.241
What did he do with the corpse he stole?

06:47.324 --> 06:49.743
Maybe he was forced to abandon it.

06:49.827 --> 06:54.081
We combed the facility. Where could he
hide a body where it couldn't be found?

06:54.164 --> 06:56.083
I'll show you.

06:57.585 --> 07:01.338
All hospitals operate some form
of medical-waste processing.

07:01.422 --> 07:04.258
This unit disposes of surgical remains.

07:04.800 --> 07:10.848
Amputations, excised tumours... they're
ground up and heated with microwaves...

07:10.931 --> 07:14.602
And the result is a sterile soot
that's used as road fill.

07:14.685 --> 07:17.021
Then there's nothing for us to find.

07:17.146 --> 07:20.190
That depends how often
they dispose of their waste.

07:20.274 --> 07:22.943
Hopefully, only once every few days.

07:28.449 --> 07:30.034
We're in luck.

07:30.117 --> 07:32.119
Are you sure about
this? If you're not sure,

07:32.202 --> 07:35.205
I don't see any reason
to disturb all this stuff...

07:35.331 --> 07:39.460
- (Squishing sound)
- Mulder, I need help. Your arms are longer.

07:50.054 --> 07:52.890
Oh. I think I got the toy surprise.

07:58.687 --> 07:59.813
Leonard betts.

07:59.897 --> 08:01.815
That's his head...

08:01.899 --> 08:04.026
But where's his body?

08:04.234 --> 08:08.572
Maybe he didn't dispose of the body.
Maybe he got it out of here somehow.

08:08.656 --> 08:10.866
Why take time to dispose of the head?

08:11.075 --> 08:14.745
Maybe there's an answer here.
Something you should check out.

08:14.995 --> 08:18.707
We know he died in an automobile accident.
What more is there to know?

08:18.832 --> 08:21.085
Maybe nothing, but it's all we got.

08:21.210 --> 08:23.754
You should find a place
to examine betts's head.

08:23.879 --> 08:28.175
- While you do what?
- Check his house. I wanna see how he lives.

08:28.258 --> 08:30.344
- Lived.
- Lived.

08:47.194 --> 08:50.280
Case number 226-897. Leonard betts.

08:51.281 --> 08:56.036
As remains are incomplete, all
observations refer to a decapitated head.

08:56.120 --> 08:58.622
Weight: 10.9 pounds.

08:59.581 --> 09:03.752
Remains show no signs of
rigor mortis or fixed iividity.

09:06.463 --> 09:09.383
Nor do the corneas appear clouded...

09:09.466 --> 09:15.556
Which would seem inconsistent with
the witnessed time of death, 19 hours ago.

09:16.974 --> 09:21.228
I'll begin with the intermastoid
incision and frontal craniotomy...

09:21.311 --> 09:24.106
Then make my examination of the brain.

09:24.732 --> 09:26.483
Oh! God!

09:51.175 --> 09:53.969
- (Man) Which one?
- (Mulder) This one here.

09:58.015 --> 10:00.517
- Thanks. I'll lock up.
- Ok.

11:20.055 --> 11:22.099
(Phone ringing)

11:25.686 --> 11:27.521
- Mulder.
- (Scully) It's me.

11:27.604 --> 11:30.357
I've run into kind of
a unique situation here.

11:30.440 --> 11:33.402
- What did you find?
- So far, not much.

11:33.777 --> 11:37.114
I did a pet scan
on Leonard betts's remains.

11:37.197 --> 11:41.618
Actually, four times now. And each time
the images come out degraded...

11:41.743 --> 11:43.620
Like it's fogged somehow.

11:44.246 --> 11:48.709
- Like the security footage.
- This is cutting-edge technology here.

11:48.792 --> 11:52.045
The technicians say the machine
is working perfectly.

11:52.129 --> 11:57.217
The only thing that could account for the
image distortion is some form of radiation.

11:57.301 --> 12:01.138
But I don't see how or where
it could be emanating from.

12:01.221 --> 12:06.310
- What did your examination uncover?
- I haven't performed an examination yet.

12:06.393 --> 12:07.895
Why not?

12:07.978 --> 12:10.480
Well, because I, uh...

12:10.814 --> 12:15.485
I experienced an unusual degree
of postmortem galvanic response.

12:16.153 --> 12:19.448
- The head moved?
- It blinked at me.

12:19.823 --> 12:21.909
I know exactly what it is.

12:21.992 --> 12:26.788
It's residual electrical activity stored
chemically in... in the dead cells.

12:26.997 --> 12:28.790
Blinked or winked?

12:30.500 --> 12:32.127
You're afraid to cut into it.

12:32.419 --> 12:35.505
Scully, you're not saying
that it's alive, are you?

12:35.672 --> 12:38.091
No. I am certainly not saying that at all.

12:38.175 --> 12:41.511
But has it crossed your mind
that it's not quite dead, either?

12:41.595 --> 12:44.848
- What do you mean?
- I'm standing here in betts's apartment.

12:44.932 --> 12:49.353
Whoever we saw in those video grabs,
his clothes are strewn all over the floor.

12:49.478 --> 12:52.481
Made himself at home.
Maybe he was home.

12:52.856 --> 12:54.942
- Leonard betts.
- Yeah.

12:55.651 --> 12:58.487
- Without his head.
- Yeah.

12:59.446 --> 13:02.032
Mulder, I don't even know
how to respond to that.

13:02.199 --> 13:05.118
I'm gonna put the building
under surveillance...

13:05.202 --> 13:07.496
Just in case whoever it is comes back.

13:07.663 --> 13:09.706
I'll be in touch.

13:48.745 --> 13:50.205
Michele?

13:50.706 --> 13:51.999
Michele wilkes?

13:52.416 --> 13:55.377
- Yes.
- I'm fox mulder. I'm with the FBI.

13:56.086 --> 14:00.090
You're responsible for the disposition
of Leonard betts's remains.

14:00.215 --> 14:04.177
He didn't have any family.
No friends either, as far as I could tell.

14:04.261 --> 14:07.264
- Except you.
- I liked him.

14:07.347 --> 14:12.102
But I wasn't really his friend.
He didn't let people get that close.

14:12.227 --> 14:16.023
I'm not sure I could call myself his
partner. Mostly I stayed out of his way.

14:16.106 --> 14:19.443
- What do you mean?
- He was an amazing medical technician.

14:19.526 --> 14:24.114
He could diagnose illness better
than any doctor I've ever seen.

14:24.614 --> 14:29.286
You know how they say some people can
just look at you and tell you what's wrong?

14:29.411 --> 14:34.708
Leonard could do that. Especially with
cancer. He should have been an oncologist.

14:34.791 --> 14:37.711
He used to volunteer weekends
at the cancer ward.

14:37.794 --> 14:39.421
Read to patients, stuff like that.

14:39.504 --> 14:43.508
Did you ever notice anything
about him? Anything odd?

14:43.592 --> 14:46.887
No. Well, he never got sick.

14:46.970 --> 14:49.973
That was pretty amazing, doing what we do.

14:50.098 --> 14:53.393
- He was the picture of health.
- Was he ever injured on the job?

14:53.477 --> 14:55.479
No. Never.

14:55.562 --> 14:57.064
I mean, until...

14:57.439 --> 14:58.607
Oh, yeah.

14:59.149 --> 15:00.734
I'm sorry.

15:00.817 --> 15:04.821
I don't know what all this has to do with
someone stealing Leonard's body.

15:04.905 --> 15:07.949
It almost sounds like
you're investigating Leonard.

15:08.158 --> 15:12.412
No, no... thanks for bearing with
my questions. I appreciate your time.

15:27.677 --> 15:32.099
This is biopolymerisation,
a high-tech mummification process.

15:32.182 --> 15:34.601
The remains are dipped in the epoxy.

15:34.684 --> 15:38.438
Once it's cured, the specimen
can be sliced for examination.

15:38.522 --> 15:41.108
Or you got yourself a nice paperweight.

15:41.191 --> 15:45.946
At any rate, we should have
some autopsy answers for you soon.

15:46.613 --> 15:50.534
I'm starting with an anterior slice
from your mr betts...

15:51.201 --> 15:53.870
One favouring the frontal lobe.

16:01.461 --> 16:04.047
- Well, this is certainly strange.
- What?

16:04.464 --> 16:08.552
- There's something wrong with the image?
- In a manner of speaking.

16:08.635 --> 16:10.720
Here, see for yourself.

16:14.015 --> 16:18.228
Oh, my god. His entire brain
looks like one giant glioma.

16:18.645 --> 16:21.064
- He had cancer?
- He was riddled with it.

16:21.189 --> 16:25.235
Every cell in the sample. Every cell
in his entire head and in his brain...

16:25.318 --> 16:29.197
Was all cancerous.
It's completely pervasive.

16:29.406 --> 16:31.908
- Could you live in this condition?
- Live?

16:32.033 --> 16:36.413
This man would have been long dead before
reaching such an extreme metastatic stage.

16:36.538 --> 16:37.664
How do you explain it?

16:37.747 --> 16:41.668
Maybe the polymerisation process
distorted the sample somehow.

16:41.751 --> 16:45.547
Maybe we're not really seeing
what we think we're seeing.

16:46.381 --> 16:49.843
Maybe we're just seeing it
clearly for the first time.

16:49.926 --> 16:53.221
- What are you suggesting?
- Let's get a slice to go.

16:59.269 --> 17:04.107
(Woman on radio) Monongahela, 136,
en route with a male not responding to cpr.

17:04.191 --> 17:06.276
Please advise.

17:07.777 --> 17:10.238
Dispatch, somebody pick up, please.

17:12.115 --> 17:18.622
(Betts's voice) Allegheny catholic, 208. I
know you're up to your ass in alligators...

17:18.747 --> 17:20.624
Michele?

17:21.290 --> 17:23.251
Leonard?

17:23.542 --> 17:25.127
Let's go here.

17:25.212 --> 17:27.297
Michele! Come on!

17:30.383 --> 17:33.136
(Woman) It seems to be working.
Good call, 208.

17:33.220 --> 17:36.723
- Thanks for the tip.
- (Betts's voice) Glad I could help.

17:38.808 --> 17:42.938
Oh, wow. I've never worked with
a sample of human tissue before.

17:43.897 --> 17:45.899
What exactly were you looking to find?

17:45.982 --> 17:48.276
- I'll tell you if we find it.
- Excellent.

17:48.652 --> 17:52.572
Are you ever asked to defend this
as a legitimate scientific process?

17:52.656 --> 17:54.908
Only if you're not happy with the results.

17:54.991 --> 17:58.328
Chuck did pioneering work
in kirlian photography in the us.

17:58.411 --> 18:02.082
Although I prefer the umbrella term
"aura photography".

18:02.165 --> 18:05.252
By applying high-frequency electricity...

18:05.335 --> 18:09.172
I am able to photograph
an organism's coronal discharge.

18:09.464 --> 18:12.425
- Coronal discharge?
- Coronal discharge. Life force.

18:12.509 --> 18:15.762
"Chi" is an accepted fact
in most eastern cultures.

18:15.845 --> 18:19.266
And the theoretical basis of
holistic medicine, of acupuncture.

18:19.349 --> 18:21.017
What is its application here?

18:21.101 --> 18:25.188
It may account for the fogging of
your pet scan of Leonard betts's head.

18:33.613 --> 18:38.285
You know, with this equipment, I have
been able to capture phantom images...

18:38.368 --> 18:40.954
Of whole leaves that were cut in half...

18:41.037 --> 18:45.542
Or the vestigial image of a
lizard's tail long after it's been cutoff.

18:45.667 --> 18:48.295
Which, you have to admit, is pretty cool.

18:51.631 --> 18:53.967
It looks like we got somethin' here.

18:55.135 --> 18:57.220
Oh, yeah.

18:58.888 --> 19:02.684
Now, I don't know exactly
what you're looking for, but...

19:05.854 --> 19:10.567
Oh, yeah. There's definitely
some kind of energy happenin' here.

19:11.401 --> 19:15.905
Chuck, would you believe that
this man's head had been decapitated?

19:16.031 --> 19:18.700
- Oh, come on. No way.
- Way.

19:22.746 --> 19:25.040
Are we happy with the results?

19:28.251 --> 19:31.338
Those sure as hell
looked like shoulders to me.

19:31.421 --> 19:35.091
I don't even know how to explain
that photo, or even what it proves.

19:35.175 --> 19:37.260
What if it proves that betts is alive?

19:37.385 --> 19:40.013
- Mulder!
- You said he was riddled with cancer.

19:40.096 --> 19:43.683
What is cancer but normal cells
growing rapidly out of control...

19:43.767 --> 19:46.186
Usually caused by damage to their DNA.

19:46.269 --> 19:48.438
- Where is this going?
- Let me tell you.

19:48.563 --> 19:51.608
What if the cancer was not
caused by damaged DNA?

19:51.691 --> 19:57.530
If the cancer was not a destructive factor,
but was rather the normal state of being?

19:57.614 --> 20:00.867
Even if that were possible,
he's been decapitated.

20:00.950 --> 20:04.871
What if this man's life force, his chi,
whatever you want to call it...

20:04.954 --> 20:07.874
Somehow retained a blueprint
of the man himself...

20:07.957 --> 20:11.378
Guiding rapid growth not as cancer
but as regeneration?

20:11.461 --> 20:13.880
You think Leonard betts regrew his head?

20:13.963 --> 20:17.801
The fluid that I found in betts's bathtub
was povidone-iodine.

20:17.926 --> 20:21.805
It's often used by lab researchers
on reptiles to aid regeneration.

20:21.888 --> 20:25.225
We both know that salamanders
have grown entirely new limbs.

20:25.308 --> 20:30.146
Salamanders are one thing, but no mammal
possesses that kind of regenerative power.

20:30.230 --> 20:32.816
There is no creature
that can regrow its head.

20:32.941 --> 20:35.235
Worms. You cut a worm in half,
you get two.

20:35.318 --> 20:37.070
Mulder, they're worms.

20:37.153 --> 20:39.489
I'm just saying it's not unheard of.

20:39.614 --> 20:43.743
Well, someone is going to great lengths
to dispose of the evidence.

20:43.827 --> 20:46.413
Maybe betts is trying
to protect his secret.

20:46.496 --> 20:48.581
(Phone rings)

20:50.667 --> 20:52.502
Scully.

20:52.585 --> 20:54.671
Yeah.

20:57.841 --> 20:59.509
Great. Thanks.

20:59.634 --> 21:01.511
Leonard betts did have secrets.

21:01.594 --> 21:05.265
One of them being that he had
an alter ego named Albert Tanner.

21:05.348 --> 21:06.433
Who?

21:06.516 --> 21:11.604
I had Danny run the fingerprints. Two names
came up: The second was Albert Tanner.

21:11.688 --> 21:15.191
Albert Tanner has a relative,
Elaine Tanner, his mother...

21:15.275 --> 21:18.319
Who just happens to live here
in Pittsburgh.

21:19.279 --> 21:21.364
(Doorbell)

21:26.202 --> 21:27.620
- Elaine Tanner?
- Yes.

21:27.704 --> 21:30.957
I'm agent Scully. This is agent mulder.
We're with the FBI.

21:31.040 --> 21:34.669
- Oh. What can I do for you?
- Is your son Albert Tanner?

21:35.545 --> 21:37.881
We'd like to ask you some questions.

21:43.803 --> 21:48.016
Please excuse me for one second.
I've got something on the stove.

21:52.479 --> 21:54.564
Scully.

22:06.367 --> 22:09.496
- Mrs Tanner, is this your son?
- Yes. That's Albert.

22:09.746 --> 22:12.499
We know this man as Leonard Morris betts.

22:12.582 --> 22:15.084
- Are you familiar with that name?
- No.

22:15.251 --> 22:17.754
Do you know if your son
used any other names?

22:17.879 --> 22:20.757
Why are you asking me about him?

22:21.508 --> 22:25.011
Mrs Tanner, are you aware that
your son has recently died?

22:25.094 --> 22:27.013
What do you mean, "recently"?

22:27.096 --> 22:29.349
When did your son die?

22:29.432 --> 22:33.353
Six years ago. He was killed
in an automobile accident.

22:34.938 --> 22:38.858
Would it be possible to get a copy
of the death certificate?

22:39.234 --> 22:41.277
Of course.

22:43.780 --> 22:45.907
Confused yet?

22:58.419 --> 23:02.298
Excuse me. I'm... I'm looking for an EMT...

23:02.382 --> 23:04.467
The man driving unit 208.

23:04.801 --> 23:09.138
The new guy. 208's over there. He just
went off shift, but you might catch him.

23:09.222 --> 23:10.890
Thanks.

23:15.979 --> 23:18.064
Leonard?

23:38.751 --> 23:40.837
Leonard?

23:48.261 --> 23:51.598
Oh, my god. It can't be. How can it be?

23:54.183 --> 23:57.478
- Leonard, is it you?
- Hey, Michele.

24:00.189 --> 24:02.191
It's ok.

24:10.617 --> 24:12.535
It's ok.

24:19.208 --> 24:22.378
I just wish you hadn't
found me, that's all.

24:22.503 --> 24:24.547
What are you talking about?

24:25.673 --> 24:26.716
Leonard?

24:29.802 --> 24:31.888
I'm sorry.

24:32.180 --> 24:34.223
I'm sorry.

24:35.141 --> 24:36.351
I'm sorry.

24:50.198 --> 24:51.866
(Guard) Hey! You there!

24:53.576 --> 24:54.911
Hold it!

24:59.207 --> 25:01.250
Come back here!

25:02.210 --> 25:04.253
Stop where you are!

25:26.109 --> 25:28.611
Stay there, you son of a bitch.

25:29.445 --> 25:31.531
Ronnie?

25:31.781 --> 25:33.616
- Oh, pick up, man.
- Go ahead.

25:33.741 --> 25:37.787
We got a situation in the parking lot.
This guy just attacked some woman.

25:37.912 --> 25:40.456
She's up at the ambulance parking area.

25:55.304 --> 25:57.432
(Bone cracks)

26:00.435 --> 26:02.437
I'm gonna check on that guy.

26:45.688 --> 26:47.774
Siskel or ebert?

26:48.149 --> 26:51.694
- What's the story?
- Michele wilkes was murdered.

26:51.778 --> 26:55.198
We wouldn't know that if the
security guard hadn't witnessed it.

26:55.281 --> 27:00.203
I found an autoinjector in the grass. She was
given a lethal dose of potassium chloride.

27:00.286 --> 27:04.457
It's an electrolyte found naturally in
the body. A coroner doesn't check for it.

27:04.540 --> 27:08.544
Betts was here. She discovered that,
then he killed her to protect his secret.

27:08.628 --> 27:11.047
The security guard did ID him
as her attacker.

27:11.130 --> 27:14.634
He worked as an EMT, but his co-workers
said his name was truelove.

27:14.717 --> 27:18.262
Do you know how this man escaped?
He tore off his thumb...

27:18.346 --> 27:21.057
Because he knew
he could regrow another one.

27:21.140 --> 27:22.767
It just doesn't work that way.

27:22.850 --> 27:26.729
But is betts's ability to regenerate
any greater a leap forward...

27:26.813 --> 27:30.233
Than our ancestors' ability
to communicate with language?

27:30.316 --> 27:34.111
But language, evolution...
It's a process of steps, not leaps.

27:34.195 --> 27:39.075
Recent evolutionary theory would disagree.
What scientists call punctual equilibrium...

27:39.158 --> 27:42.870
Theorises that evolutionary advances
are cataclysmic, not gradual.

27:42.954 --> 27:47.583
That evolution occurs not along a straight
graphable line but in huge fits and starts...

27:47.667 --> 27:50.086
And the unimaginable
happens in the gaps.

27:50.169 --> 27:52.922
The gap between what we are
and what betts has become.

27:53.005 --> 27:55.633
What you're describing is
someone so evolved...

27:55.716 --> 27:58.344
That you wouldn't even call him human.

27:58.678 --> 28:02.890
On the other hand, how evolved
can a man be who drives a dodge dart?

28:14.443 --> 28:18.197
Oh, my god. "Myeloid sarcoma
- epithelial carcinoma."

28:18.281 --> 28:22.910
These are all cancerous tumours. This
is surgical waste, tagged for disposal.

28:22.994 --> 28:26.664
- What do you think he wanted with them?
- You may not want to know.

28:26.747 --> 28:30.376
There's a possibility that
Leonard betts not only is cancer...

28:30.459 --> 28:33.045
But that he needs it for survival?

28:34.463 --> 28:36.674
- So this is...
- Snack food.

28:36.757 --> 28:39.677
Wouldn't it make sense
that natural selection...

28:39.760 --> 28:42.722
Would incorporate cancer,
the greatest health threat,

28:42.805 --> 28:44.390
as part of our genetic make-up?

28:44.473 --> 28:46.767
Why do I think Darwin
is rolling in his grave?

28:46.851 --> 28:51.522
Ask yourself: Why is Leonard betts an EMT?
Why does he regularly visit cancer wards?

28:51.606 --> 28:53.357
Access.

28:53.649 --> 28:57.612
The car's registered to one
Elaine Tanner, 3108 old bank road.

28:57.820 --> 28:59.322
Betts's mom.

28:59.405 --> 29:03.451
Do you think mom knows her dead son
is tooling around in her car?

29:08.539 --> 29:12.209
Elaine Tanner? We have a warrant
to search the premises.

29:18.090 --> 29:21.928
Mrs Tanner, we know your son is alive
and that you're in contact with him.

29:22.011 --> 29:24.555
You need to tell us where we can find him.

29:26.307 --> 29:29.685
Last night he murdered
a woman in cold blood.

29:29.810 --> 29:34.190
By lying to protect him, you are
considered an accessory to murder.

29:35.066 --> 29:39.320
Can you tell me what you use this for?
It's a pretty big bottle.

29:39.570 --> 29:41.864
You get a lot of cuts?

29:42.323 --> 29:45.117
When my son was eight years old...

29:45.201 --> 29:49.622
There were two boys who picked on him
because he was different.

29:49.705 --> 29:54.168
He just ignored them.
He knew he was better than they were.

29:55.711 --> 29:59.632
One day they cornered him
walking home. Beat him up.

29:59.924 --> 30:04.512
He didn't even try to fight back.
Just lay there, taking the blows.

30:05.221 --> 30:09.225
So I don't believe you when
you tell me he killed anyone.

30:10.142 --> 30:12.812
But, if he did, he had his reasons.

30:13.771 --> 30:17.900
- What reasons, mrs Tanner?
- God put him here for a purpose.

30:18.192 --> 30:22.989
God means for him to stay,
even if people don't understand.

30:24.365 --> 30:26.867
And that's all I've got to say.

30:29.453 --> 30:31.539
(Sports commentary on TV)

30:42.842 --> 30:44.927
(Coughing)

31:41.942 --> 31:44.028
(Betts) Excuse me.

31:45.821 --> 31:49.450
I'm sorry, but you've got something I need.

31:53.788 --> 31:55.873
Scully?

31:57.750 --> 32:01.921
- Find something?
- No sign. Not even a stray sock. Just this.

32:02.338 --> 32:07.051
- A receipt for a storage locker.
- A key on his key ring has "112" on it.

32:09.470 --> 32:11.555
Let's check it out.

32:40.584 --> 32:42.670
(Screaming)

33:01.730 --> 33:03.816
(Screams)

33:22.918 --> 33:24.587
Scully.

33:38.184 --> 33:40.269
(Car engine starts)

34:07.922 --> 34:10.841
Mr John gillnitz.
Death from massive blood loss...

34:10.966 --> 34:14.969
Due to what I can only describe as
a skilful removal of his left lung.

34:15.137 --> 34:16.931
- It's betts.
- Doing what?

34:17.014 --> 34:20.100
This man's medical records
will show he had lung cancer.

34:20.184 --> 34:23.687
- And betts was in need of what he had.
- How would he have known that?

34:23.812 --> 34:26.982
He had an ability to diagnose cancer.

34:27.065 --> 34:29.025
Maybe his need provided
a heightened sense.

34:29.193 --> 34:33.322
Well, whatever he was doing,
he's taking the secret to his grave.

34:33.447 --> 34:35.491
Yeah, for the second time.

34:38.327 --> 34:40.371
Mulder, Leonard betts is dead.

34:40.496 --> 34:44.123
Of that I am absolutely certain.
And he is not coming back.

34:44.208 --> 34:46.793
You would've said that about Albert Tanner.

34:46.877 --> 34:48.045
I don't understand.

34:48.128 --> 34:51.090
Six years ago Tanner dies in an accident.
His mother buries him.

34:51.172 --> 34:54.551
Several days ago he shows up
as Leonard betts. Explain that.

34:54.677 --> 34:58.973
- Maybe the first death was staged.
- You wanna bet on that?

35:29.211 --> 35:31.797
Will the real Leonard
betts please stand up?

35:31.880 --> 35:34.717
These men may be no more
than monozygotic twins.

35:34.842 --> 35:37.761
I think that what we're
standing witness to here...

35:37.886 --> 35:41.181
Goes way beyond the regeneration
of a thumb or a limb or a head.

35:41.265 --> 35:45.436
Mulder, I don't know what you're
getting at. Regeneration of an entire body?

35:45.561 --> 35:47.229
I don't know why I'm listening.

35:47.354 --> 35:51.191
Because I think that the fiery crash
that killed this man was a ruse...

35:51.275 --> 35:54.403
And that this man lying here
is still at large.

36:03.370 --> 36:06.707
I'm scared, honey. The FBI...

36:07.249 --> 36:11.795
They seem to know all about you.
They dug up the coffin.

36:12.629 --> 36:14.757
They found your friend.

36:15.883 --> 36:19.303
I don't think they're ever
going to leave you alone.

36:19.553 --> 36:21.597
And you're weak.

36:22.264 --> 36:24.725
You have to restore your strength.

36:25.809 --> 36:28.312
You know what you have to do.

36:32.316 --> 36:34.443
I'm your mother.

36:35.402 --> 36:38.447
And it's a mother's duty to provide.

36:50.834 --> 36:54.421
If this man really exists,
what makes you think he'd come here?

36:54.505 --> 37:00.594
The only person who knows his secret is his
mom. If we get him, it'll be through her.

37:01.011 --> 37:03.138
(Siren wailing)

37:16.985 --> 37:19.863
- Get out of the truck!
- Federal agents!

37:20.656 --> 37:22.783
Whoa! Whoa! What the hell...?

37:23.200 --> 37:25.494
- What are you doing here?
- We got a call.

37:25.619 --> 37:29.415
Elderly woman with massive chest trauma
and blood loss. 3108 old bank.

37:29.498 --> 37:32.668
- (Man) Believe me, that's all we know.
- Stay here.

37:52.521 --> 37:55.023
Mulder, get the emts up here!

37:56.358 --> 37:58.402
(Mulder) Guys, get in here!

38:05.868 --> 38:08.954
She has an open wound. A surgical cut.

38:09.037 --> 38:11.540
Three guesses what was removed.

38:12.749 --> 38:16.420
He did this to her, and then
he called an ambulance.

38:17.754 --> 38:21.592
Judging by the response time,
he might still be here.

38:30.726 --> 38:33.103
Betts is gone.
He must have taken off on foot.

38:33.228 --> 38:38.066
Well, she's gonna be ok, mulder. We might
be able to get where he went out of her.

38:38.192 --> 38:43.071
You stay with her. I'll call the local pd
and have them cordon off the area.

38:43.780 --> 38:47.367
This is special agent mulder.
I've got an emergency situation.

38:47.451 --> 38:53.373
I need all available units to 3108 old bank
road. I'm searching for a murder suspect.

39:19.983 --> 39:25.239
Mulder, mrs Tanner's going into the er,
but she took a downturn en route.

39:25.322 --> 39:29.743
They defibrillated her, but there's no
chance of getting anything cogent from her.

39:29.826 --> 39:31.662
What about on your end?

39:31.787 --> 39:33.997
We're going house to house here.

39:34.122 --> 39:35.499
We've got a chopper coming,

39:35.582 --> 39:38.627
but I'd say betts has a pretty good chance
of getting away.

39:38.752 --> 39:41.838
If he steals a car or gets a ride,
he could get away for good.

39:41.964 --> 39:44.299
He worked this thing out pretty well.

39:44.424 --> 39:47.803
So if there's anything you can get
out of mrs Tanner tonight...

39:47.928 --> 39:51.014
At this point we don't have
much else to go on.

39:52.766 --> 39:54.268
Get over here right now.

39:54.643 --> 39:56.520
- What?
- Get over here right now.

40:13.662 --> 40:14.663
Oh!

40:23.171 --> 40:24.840
I'm sorry.

40:27.467 --> 40:29.970
But you've got something I need.

41:12.095 --> 41:14.890
Oh, my god. Let's get a crash cart.

41:41.750 --> 41:44.252
They pronounced betts ten minutes ago.

41:44.378 --> 41:47.547
- He's dead?
- As near as anyone can tell.

41:47.631 --> 41:51.802
His mom's alive, due to the fact that
betts dressed her wounds so carefully.

41:51.927 --> 41:53.804
She'll pull through, for now.

41:54.054 --> 41:56.390
- Cancer.
- Yeah.

41:59.267 --> 42:02.688
"Metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma",
to be precise.

42:02.771 --> 42:04.773
She was treated for it previously.

42:04.898 --> 42:08.068
Got a clean bill of health
about three months ago.

42:11.279 --> 42:13.615
You did a good job, Scully.

42:15.450 --> 42:17.786
You should be proud.

42:20.288 --> 42:22.624
I want to go home.

43:09.171 --> 43:11.214
(Coughing)

44:08.730 --> 44:10.607
Subtitles by visiontext

44:18.907 --> 44:20.534
(Child) I made this!
