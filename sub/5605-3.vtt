WEBVTT

00:04.104 --> 00:06.270
Oof.
I need more java.

00:06.272 --> 00:08.438
The shakes give my fashion
designs a little extra pizzazz.

00:08.440 --> 00:09.705
Ooh.

00:09.707 --> 00:13.741
A certain
je ne sais "quoi-fee."

00:16.145 --> 00:17.611
I don't get it.

00:17.613 --> 00:19.045
It's worse when you do.

00:20.114 --> 00:21.379
You've been working really hard

00:21.381 --> 00:23.047
since you got back
from New York, Mandy.

00:23.049 --> 00:24.515
Yeah, well,
I got to prove

00:24.517 --> 00:26.483
that everything Donna Karan said
about me was wrong.

00:26.485 --> 00:27.951
Except for when she said,

00:27.953 --> 00:29.619
"If nothing else,
you're pretty."

00:29.621 --> 00:31.954
That was really sweet.

00:31.956 --> 00:33.455
You don't even know
when someone's insulting you.

00:33.457 --> 00:34.489
You're amazing.

00:34.491 --> 00:36.357
Thank you.

00:36.359 --> 00:37.624
Lot of mail today, folks.

00:37.626 --> 00:39.325
Oh, anything for me?

00:39.327 --> 00:42.361
Just the usual six pounds
of women's pajama catalogs.

00:42.363 --> 00:44.463
Say goodbye
to the rainforest.

00:44.465 --> 00:46.531
You women just have to look good
while you sleep.

00:46.533 --> 00:48.533
Oh, come on.
You get catalogs for men.

00:48.535 --> 00:49.967
Yeah? Bed, Bath & Bullets?

00:49.969 --> 00:51.068
Crate & Bullets?
Which one?

00:52.371 --> 00:55.071
Ooh. So cute.

00:55.073 --> 00:57.239
Ooh, silk.
So copying this pattern.

00:57.241 --> 00:58.974
Or these.
So cozy.

00:58.976 --> 01:02.210
So ordering. So sad.

01:02.212 --> 01:05.680
Well, Eve, we got
our raft-trip information.

01:05.682 --> 01:08.983
Now maybe that kid with
the banjo will learn a new song.

01:08.985 --> 01:11.151
Hells yeah! Up top. Up top.

01:11.153 --> 01:12.418
What are you guys doing?

01:12.420 --> 01:13.752
Just the awesome

01:13.754 --> 01:15.520
dad-daughter whitewater
senior year spectacular.

01:15.522 --> 01:17.088
No bigs.

01:17.090 --> 01:19.657
Oh, yeah, yeah.
You took Kristin on that.

01:19.659 --> 01:21.258
Even though
she was pregnant.

01:21.260 --> 01:23.693
Well, my grandson
is sharp as a tack.

01:23.695 --> 01:28.130
Apparently, all that jostling
in utero made his mind sharp.

01:29.066 --> 01:30.432
Another Baxter family
tradition,

01:30.434 --> 01:32.033
like going to
church every Sunday

01:32.035 --> 01:34.068
and watching dad do
that open-eye sleep thing.

01:38.607 --> 01:41.007
Amen!
Amen, everybody.

01:41.009 --> 01:43.242
You know, that rafting
trip is not a tradition

01:43.244 --> 01:44.343
if not everybody went on one.

01:44.345 --> 01:46.111
Uh-huh.

01:46.113 --> 01:49.581
I asked her senior year.
I'm sure you were<i> so</i> busy.

01:49.583 --> 01:50.682
Actually,
you never offered.

01:50.684 --> 01:52.116
What?!

01:52.118 --> 01:54.084
Mom, I wouldn't
have gone anyway.

01:54.086 --> 01:55.685
I'm not really
into rafting.

01:55.687 --> 01:58.854
I mean, look at me, people.
Why would I be?

02:00.190 --> 02:01.522
Wow.

02:01.524 --> 02:03.690
Hillary Clinton's
asking us for money.

02:03.692 --> 02:06.125
Will her string of mistakes
never end?

02:07.795 --> 02:10.629
The hits keep on coming,
but she'll never top Benghazi.

02:10.631 --> 02:12.464
That's her
<i> Stairway to Heaven.</i>

02:12.466 --> 02:14.699
Yeah, that's the kind
of screw-ups that happen

02:14.701 --> 02:17.301
when you spend all your
free time deleting e-mails.

02:17.303 --> 02:19.469
(whimpering)

02:19.471 --> 02:22.738
It's not a mistake.
I donated to Hillary.

02:22.740 --> 02:24.439
I think it's time.

02:24.441 --> 02:25.706
Well, I think it's time

02:25.708 --> 02:27.374
to pierce my broken heart
with this knife.

02:28.710 --> 02:30.476
Mom, I know you love
the show<i> Scandal,</i>

02:30.478 --> 02:32.144
but do you really
want to watch it

02:32.146 --> 02:33.645
every night
for four years?

02:33.647 --> 02:35.480
Yes, I do.

02:35.482 --> 02:38.483
And every night, I will be in
a different pair of pajamas.

02:38.485 --> 02:40.451
What would I do without Eve?

02:40.453 --> 02:42.386
Well, you're never gonna
have to worry about Eve.

02:42.388 --> 02:43.787
You two will always be
talking politics,

02:43.789 --> 02:45.388
going to games,
shooting guns.

02:45.390 --> 02:46.622
The real question is,

02:46.624 --> 02:47.789
what are you gonna do
with Mandy?

02:47.791 --> 02:50.224
Sounds like
I'll be kind of busy.

02:50.226 --> 02:52.259
You know, Mandy's
gonna be gone soon,

02:52.261 --> 02:53.593
and if you don't have
something in common,

02:53.595 --> 02:55.328
she's just gonna
become a holiday child.

02:55.330 --> 02:57.229
A holiday child?
Yeah.

02:57.231 --> 02:59.231
You know, one of those kids
you just see on the holidays?

02:59.233 --> 03:00.865
Like the baby
Jesus.

03:02.401 --> 03:04.467
You need to find stuff
to do with Mandy.

03:04.469 --> 03:06.569
I think I know what
I'm talking about.

03:06.571 --> 03:08.404
You<i> used</i> to know
what you were talking about.

03:08.406 --> 03:10.539
This letter
ruins your credibility.

03:11.842 --> 03:14.909
-- Captions by VITAC --

03:18.747 --> 03:20.413
Give me one reason --
one reason.

03:20.415 --> 03:22.515
I just think it's
time.

03:23.751 --> 03:25.417
Ed, if you were putting money
in the election,

03:25.419 --> 03:26.785
who would you bet on?

03:26.787 --> 03:29.487
My streak of backing
losers is over, Mike.

03:29.489 --> 03:31.755
Bobby Jindal all the way.

03:31.757 --> 03:33.757
Oh, there's money
well-spent.

03:33.759 --> 03:36.259
Hey, I was just looking
through the security footage.

03:36.261 --> 03:37.593
Did you guys know

03:37.595 --> 03:40.462
Kyle sneaks in at night
and stocks the shelves?

03:40.464 --> 03:43.164
Kid's got a problem
with breaking and organizing.

03:43.166 --> 03:44.431
Thanks, Chuck.

03:44.433 --> 03:46.366
How's your boy doing
at Florida State?

03:46.368 --> 03:48.267
Oh, I haven't talked to Grant
in a while.

03:48.269 --> 03:51.136
Wow. If I knew that's all
it took not to talk to you,

03:51.138 --> 03:52.270
I'd move to Florida.

03:52.272 --> 03:54.538
But we text
all the time.

03:54.540 --> 03:57.207
Last night, they had pizza
in the dining hall.

03:57.209 --> 03:59.642
He was fired up.
Look at all those emoticons.

03:59.644 --> 04:01.610
Oh, it's so good to be
a parent these days.

04:01.612 --> 04:04.179
So much easier to stay connected
with all that technology.

04:04.181 --> 04:05.346
Exactly.

04:05.348 --> 04:06.847
Every time I post
on Facebook,

04:06.849 --> 04:08.849
my four daughters
like the hell out of it.

04:08.851 --> 04:10.317
Yeah, that's good.

04:10.319 --> 04:11.518
Except you have
five daughters, Ed.

04:11.520 --> 04:13.553
If you count
Maria.

04:13.555 --> 04:16.622
I like to count all my kids.

04:16.624 --> 04:18.690
She and I never had
that much in common.

04:18.692 --> 04:19.857
Yeah, but you see
her on holidays.

04:19.859 --> 04:21.024
Oh, I guess
we drifted apart.

04:21.026 --> 04:22.458
Holidays?

04:22.460 --> 04:25.160
I haven't heard from Maria
in 10 years.

04:25.162 --> 04:28.196
Hey! My boy's having tacos
for lunch!

04:32.534 --> 04:35.334
All right.
Let's go.

04:35.336 --> 04:37.569
Okay. Gun range
or batting cage?

04:37.571 --> 04:39.237
You know what? Actually,
just surprise me.

04:39.239 --> 04:41.138
No, actually, I'm talking
to your sister.  Huh?

04:41.140 --> 04:42.539
Why

04:43.575 --> 04:45.141
Am I in trouble?

04:45.143 --> 04:46.475
No, no.

04:46.477 --> 04:48.210
I just thought
it would be a great day

04:48.212 --> 04:49.744
for dad to take his fav--

04:49.746 --> 04:51.679
one of his
favorite daughters out.

04:51.681 --> 04:54.581
Um, I can't, dad.

04:54.583 --> 04:56.316
I actually have
a lot of sewing to do.

04:56.318 --> 04:57.850
Well, have your mom do it.

04:57.852 --> 05:00.185
She's always looking for extra
chores to do around here.

05:00.187 --> 05:01.819
Or is that
just the opposite?

05:01.821 --> 05:03.487
Okay, wait.

05:03.489 --> 05:05.388
I think the way everyone
wins is I go, we have fun,

05:05.390 --> 05:07.490
and Mandy stays here and does
whatever it is she does. All right.

05:07.492 --> 05:08.491
I like Eve's thing.

05:08.493 --> 05:09.658
Listen, listen,

05:09.660 --> 05:11.159
but this is really
about you and I.

05:11.161 --> 05:12.493
Let's just go
do something together.

05:12.495 --> 05:14.895
Uh, we -- Let's go to a movie.
Seen it.

05:14.897 --> 05:16.763
-I haven't told you which one.
-Seen all of them.

05:16.765 --> 05:19.432
All right, we can do anything.
Anything you want to do.

05:19.434 --> 05:21.734
Can we go to
Paris?!

05:23.270 --> 05:25.903
I don't think mom knows
what I'm dealing with here.

05:28.874 --> 05:31.407
Hey, Evie,
is your dad here?

05:31.409 --> 05:34.109
He's on his way to Paris.
Good.

05:34.111 --> 05:36.711
Uh, listen.

05:36.713 --> 05:38.345
I wanted to talk to you

05:38.347 --> 05:41.281
about your reaction
to my political donation.

05:41.283 --> 05:43.116
Look, I still love
you.

05:43.118 --> 05:44.217
Are we cool?

05:44.219 --> 05:45.518
Sit

05:45.520 --> 05:46.619
Ugh, fine.

05:46.621 --> 05:48.253
Evie, look.

05:48.255 --> 05:50.688
For the first time
in the history of this country,

05:50.690 --> 05:52.556
the president
might not be a man.

05:52.558 --> 05:54.190
I mean,
think about that.

05:54.192 --> 05:56.859
There's never been a more
exciting time to be a woman.

05:56.861 --> 05:58.794
It's always an exciting
time to be a woman.

05:58.796 --> 06:00.529
That's why
we're always so happy.

06:00.531 --> 06:01.930
No, come
on.

06:01.932 --> 06:05.199
Electing a woman now would
really mean something.

06:05.201 --> 06:06.633
I just don't think Hillary's
that strong. What?

06:06.635 --> 06:08.201
I feel like
Congress could cheat on her,

06:08.203 --> 06:09.468
and she'd just
look the other way.

06:11.572 --> 06:13.805
I mean, do you even agree
with any of her positions?

06:13.807 --> 06:16.207
It doesn't matter.
I would vote for any woman.

06:16.209 --> 06:17.575
Oh, really?
Yeah.

06:17.577 --> 06:21.445
So, like, Mrs. Hitler?
Mrs. Stalin?

06:21.447 --> 06:23.480
I think it's safe to say
that they would have done

06:23.482 --> 06:24.948
a better job than
their husbands.

06:26.284 --> 06:27.883
What I mean is
I would vote for any woman

06:27.885 --> 06:31.620
with the necessary experience
and a real shot, like Hillary.

06:31.622 --> 06:34.289
Whatever.
Support who you want.

06:34.291 --> 06:35.823
It's a free
country.

06:35.825 --> 06:37.157
Thanks to the Army

06:37.159 --> 06:38.725
Bill did such a good job
dodging.

06:38.727 --> 06:40.259
But he got to be
president,

06:40.261 --> 06:41.226
and even though
Hillary got better grades

06:41.228 --> 06:42.794
at Yale law
school.

06:42.796 --> 06:45.763
Yeah, and that's probably
the only time he<i> didn't</i> cheat.

06:45.765 --> 06:48.398
Mom?!

06:48.400 --> 06:50.867
All I can say is,
you're welcome.

06:59.844 --> 07:04.546
We went to the mall! And
we had the best time!

07:07.751 --> 07:09.751
You, uh...

07:09.753 --> 07:12.887
You here to audition
for One Direction?

07:14.790 --> 07:16.990
Haters are gonna hate.
Peace out.

07:29.270 --> 07:31.436
Hi.

07:31.438 --> 07:32.537
Hey. What'd you do?

07:32.539 --> 07:33.671
I wanted to snap some pics.

07:33.673 --> 07:35.305
Oh,
I didn't want to wrinkle

07:35.307 --> 07:36.773
those dope
threads.

07:36.775 --> 07:39.509
You hated the outfit.

07:39.511 --> 07:41.777
No, no, no, I just wanted to
put it in a safe place,

07:41.779 --> 07:44.613
in the bag where it came
from, next to the receipt.

07:44.615 --> 07:46.915
I may take it for a ride
a little later.

07:48.685 --> 07:50.718
Dad, you were the one who said
it was such a big deal

07:50.720 --> 07:52.519
that we spend some time
together.

07:52.521 --> 07:53.987
I knew this was a bad idea.

07:53.989 --> 07:55.788
It's not a bad idea, honey.
Honey, listen.

07:55.790 --> 07:58.223
We just got to find something
that we both like.

07:58.225 --> 08:00.892
Yeah. Okay.

08:09.368 --> 08:11.401
What about the stuff we
did when you were little?

08:11.403 --> 08:13.870
Uh, we could have a tea party.

08:13.872 --> 08:15.471
We could<i> join</i>
the Tea Party.

08:16.841 --> 08:18.040
Go to the putting green.

08:18.042 --> 08:20.042
We could<i> join</i>
the putting green.

08:20.044 --> 08:22.878
Dad, this is dumb.
We should just give up, okay?

08:22.880 --> 08:25.046
That's one thing we don't have
in common, is I don't quit.

08:25.048 --> 08:26.814
Yeah,
but think about it.

08:26.816 --> 08:29.483
If you did,
we'd have something in common.

08:29.485 --> 08:32.385
And then we'd be done.

08:36.590 --> 08:38.889
Evie,
look what I found for you.

08:40.993 --> 08:43.426
Hmm
<i> The Feminine Mystique.</i>

08:43.428 --> 08:44.693
Mm.

08:44.695 --> 08:46.828
It's a landmark text
in women's history.

08:46.830 --> 08:49.497
I read it in high school,
and it changed my life.

08:49.499 --> 08:52.633
Who wrote "Mrs. Tom Selleck"
100 times?

08:54.603 --> 08:55.902
(knock on door)

08:58.840 --> 09:00.105
Hey, Mr. Larabee.

09:00.107 --> 09:02.006
Ah, hello, nice Baxters.

09:02.008 --> 09:03.607
Hey, Chuck.

09:03.609 --> 09:04.941
What are you doing here?

09:04.943 --> 09:07.009
I got your text.

09:07.011 --> 09:08.377
Oh, right. Right, right, right.

09:08.379 --> 09:11.546
Um, uh, so, so --
Come in.

09:11.548 --> 09:12.747
I'm in.

09:12.749 --> 09:14.381
Yeah, uh...

09:14.383 --> 09:16.950
What's up?

09:16.952 --> 09:19.686
Vanessa, my dinner's getting cold. I
don't -- All right, all right, all right.

09:19.688 --> 09:22.422
Chuck, um,
I-I was just wondering

09:22.424 --> 09:25.725
if you wouldn't mind
explaining to me and Eve

09:25.727 --> 09:29.794
what it was like for you
on election day, 2008.

09:29.796 --> 09:32.029
Oh, it was a great day
for the country.

09:32.031 --> 09:33.630
Mm.

09:33.632 --> 09:39.035
But -- but specifically,
what was it like for<i> you?</i>

09:40.538 --> 09:43.405
Well, as an American...
Mm-hmm.

09:43.407 --> 09:45.773
...I'm always happy
when the best candidate wins.

09:47.409 --> 09:49.075
Of course.
We all are.

09:49.077 --> 09:51.644
But -- but the election
of 2008

09:51.646 --> 09:54.780
must have had
a special resonance for you.

09:54.782 --> 09:56.615
Why?

09:57.551 --> 09:59.918
What my mom is trying to say is

09:59.920 --> 10:03.888
that you must have been happy
because a black guy won.

10:03.890 --> 10:05.723
See
Oh!

10:05.725 --> 10:08.592
No. I was happy
because a smart guy won.

10:08.594 --> 10:11.995
A smart,
bla--frican American.

10:11.997 --> 10:15.398
A smart American
with smart policies.

10:15.400 --> 10:17.566
I know, but, Chuck,
you might have voted for him

10:17.568 --> 10:19.901
even if you didn't agree
with his positions, right?

10:19.903 --> 10:21.636
Why would I do that --

10:21.638 --> 10:23.004
vote for someone just because
we had something in common

10:23.006 --> 10:24.972
without taking into account
their positions?

10:24.974 --> 10:26.106
That's ridiculous.

10:26.108 --> 10:27.774
Chuck, your dinner's
getting cold.

10:27.776 --> 10:29.142
Yeah.

10:29.144 --> 10:31.677
(chuckles)

10:31.679 --> 10:33.578
"Bla-frican American."

10:33.580 --> 10:34.579
(chuckles)

10:34.581 --> 10:35.713
Not cool.

10:37.783 --> 10:39.015
(sighs)

10:39.017 --> 10:40.783
That didn't go as planned,
did it, mom?

10:40.785 --> 10:42.818
Honey, why the hell
don't you care about this?

10:42.820 --> 10:44.653
Because
I don't worry about stuff

10:44.655 --> 10:46.521
that happened
a million years ago.

10:46.523 --> 10:47.755
The only problem women
have

10:47.757 --> 10:49.423
is that they can't let go
of the past.

10:49.425 --> 10:50.657
So, you don't think

10:50.659 --> 10:53.626
that after 240 years of
doing things one way,

10:53.628 --> 10:55.127
it's not time
for a change?

10:55.129 --> 10:56.928
Look around, mom.

10:56.930 --> 10:58.696
Our lives, this house,
this kitchen --

10:58.698 --> 11:00.964
I mean, the old way seems
to work pretty well for us.

11:00.966 --> 11:03.499
Sweetie, we're more than
just cooks and servants.

11:03.501 --> 11:05.501
We can do more
than shop and clean

11:05.503 --> 11:06.668
and bake things and --

11:06.670 --> 11:09.003
(timer dings)
Not now, cookies!

11:12.774 --> 11:14.774
Kristin

11:14.776 --> 11:16.475
Hey, Ed.
Hey.

11:16.477 --> 11:18.009
Kris, I, um...

11:18.011 --> 11:19.610
I know
I don't always say it.

11:19.612 --> 11:21.345
I just want to tell
you how much it means

11:21.347 --> 11:23.947
that -- that you come
to me for advice.

11:23.949 --> 11:26.115
Well, thank you.

11:26.117 --> 11:27.783
You're welcome.

11:27.785 --> 11:31.152
I do give
pretty great advice, hmm?

11:31.154 --> 11:32.620
Ed?

11:32.622 --> 11:33.887
Mm?

11:33.889 --> 11:35.622
Would you like me
to ask you for advice?

11:35.624 --> 11:37.857
Oh, no. No.
No, I do not. No.

11:39.994 --> 11:41.526
I love you, Ed,

11:41.528 --> 11:42.660
but you're kind of
eating into my break here.

11:42.662 --> 11:46.529
Okay.
I-I need some advice.

11:46.531 --> 11:47.696
Oh.

11:47.698 --> 11:49.130
Is it about
how to talk to people?

11:49.132 --> 11:50.865
No, no, no.

11:50.867 --> 11:53.734
It's -- it's about --
it's about my daughter Maria.

11:53.736 --> 11:56.803
See, we've --
well, lost touch.

11:56.805 --> 12:00.139
Part of me wants to fly to Vegas
to make things right with her.

12:00.141 --> 12:02.207
She lives in Cleveland.

12:02.209 --> 12:04.742
I know,
but I want to go to Vegas.

12:05.978 --> 12:07.210
Think she'd
meet me there?

12:07.212 --> 12:09.545
Um, I think it's nice
that you want to fix

12:09.547 --> 12:11.179
your relationship
with your daughter.

12:11.181 --> 12:12.580
(sighs)

12:12.582 --> 12:13.981
We're just so different.

12:13.983 --> 12:16.083
Did you and your dad
always do things together?

12:16.085 --> 12:17.918
(chuckles)
Not in high school.

12:17.920 --> 12:19.486
We had nothing in common.

12:19.488 --> 12:22.522
How about that great
rafting trip you went on?

12:22.524 --> 12:24.190
No.
He had to drag me on that.

12:24.192 --> 12:26.492
He wouldn't take
"no" for an answer.

12:26.494 --> 12:28.193
Or "I'm pregnant!"
For an answer.

12:28.195 --> 12:31.563
Yeah,
my pal can be stubborn.

12:31.565 --> 12:32.830
I'm glad he was.

12:32.832 --> 12:35.199
That trip was
one of my favorite memories.

12:35.201 --> 12:38.101
Maybe I should have been
more tenacious with Maria,

12:38.103 --> 12:41.003
a little more insistent
that we do things together.

12:41.005 --> 12:43.572
See, the thing
about us daughters

12:43.574 --> 12:46.575
is that we can resent our dads
for being overbearing,

12:46.577 --> 12:48.843
but love them for
it at the same time.

12:48.845 --> 12:51.545
Well, I'm sure there's one thing
that all dads can appreciate --

12:51.547 --> 12:54.014
it's schizophrenic
mixed messages.

12:58.019 --> 13:01.520
I failed as a mother.

13:01.522 --> 13:03.121
Is another one of the girls
pregnant?

13:04.924 --> 13:06.556
'Cause if so,

13:06.558 --> 13:08.724
just put a pillow over my head
and press really hard.

13:08.726 --> 13:10.625
No, no, no.
No one's pregnant.

13:10.627 --> 13:13.027
I just -- I can't explain
feminism to Eve.

13:13.029 --> 13:15.896
Well, you probably need a man
to do it.

13:15.898 --> 13:17.731
Watch it.

13:17.733 --> 13:19.866
The reason Eve
doesn't see the world that way

13:19.868 --> 13:23.869
is because of the incredible job
you have done as a mother.  What?

13:23.871 --> 13:25.537
With the way
you handle yourself,

13:25.539 --> 13:27.205
you almost make
being a female an asset.

13:27.207 --> 13:28.739
Almost?

13:28.741 --> 13:31.074
Come on!
You know what I'm talking about.

13:31.076 --> 13:32.642
No, not really, I don't.

13:32.644 --> 13:34.043
All these girls see Is

13:34.045 --> 13:35.978
an incredibly bright,
tough woman who has no limits.

13:35.980 --> 13:37.612
Well, that woman sounds great.

13:37.614 --> 13:39.113
We should get her
to talk to Eve.

13:39.115 --> 13:40.747
MANDY: Dad!

13:40.749 --> 13:42.081
Okay,
I've been racking my brain

13:42.083 --> 13:43.282
for something
we can do together,

13:43.284 --> 13:44.783
and I've finally got it.

13:44.785 --> 13:46.217
All right, I'm --
I'm on board. What?

13:46.219 --> 13:49.086
Remember ping pong Saturdays?
Ping pong Saturdays.

13:49.088 --> 13:50.120
Ping pong! Ping pong!

13:50.122 --> 13:51.654
Ping!
Pong!

13:51.656 --> 13:52.721
(laughing) Hey!

13:52.723 --> 13:54.089
I got to go plan
an outfit.

13:54.091 --> 13:56.291
Ooh, maybe something
with white polka dots.

13:56.293 --> 13:59.994
You'll never find
the ball.

13:59.996 --> 14:01.061
(laughs)

14:01.063 --> 14:02.929
That's funny.
Yeah.

14:02.931 --> 14:04.730
I thought you hated
ping pong Saturdays.

14:04.732 --> 14:06.898
I did.
I really did.

14:06.900 --> 14:09.066
You know what?
You're a good dad.

14:09.068 --> 14:10.667
Want me to help you bring that ping
pong table up from the basement?

14:10.669 --> 14:12.235
No, I'll get it. I'll get it.

14:12.237 --> 14:13.903
Well, you'll kill yourself
if you try to do it alone.

14:13.905 --> 14:17.306
Yeah, I'm banking on it.
I'm banking on it.

14:23.246 --> 14:26.013
Whoo! This is bringing
back some memories!

14:26.015 --> 14:28.582
Man, I put some beatings
on you back in the day!

14:28.584 --> 14:29.783
(laughs

14:29.785 --> 14:30.984
Yeah, you did.

14:30.986 --> 14:32.185
Yeah, I'm
surprised

14:32.187 --> 14:33.286
you wanted
to play with me again.

14:33.288 --> 14:34.520
You and me both.

14:34.522 --> 14:35.988
(taps table)
Okay.

14:35.990 --> 14:38.623
You remember the rules? You
know, loser buys ice cream.

14:38.625 --> 14:41.225
Yeah. Hope you brought
your wallet, loser!

14:42.595 --> 14:44.628
Okay, my serve. All right.

14:44.630 --> 14:45.662
Oh!

14:45.664 --> 14:47.630
Ohh! Man.

14:47.632 --> 14:49.765
You still got
that weird serve.

14:49.767 --> 14:51.099
All right,
1 serving zero.

14:51.101 --> 14:54.302
Yeah, a big zero.
Ready?

14:54.304 --> 14:56.637
Ah, man!

14:56.639 --> 14:58.605
What are you putting on that,
a little spin?

14:58.607 --> 15:01.641
Dad, come on. What
are you doing?

15:01.643 --> 15:03.209
I'm getting my ass kicked
just like I usually do.

15:03.211 --> 15:05.110
Your serve.

15:05.112 --> 15:08.679
I'm not a little kid anymore.
You don't have to let me win.

15:08.681 --> 15:10.213
Yes, I do.

15:10.215 --> 15:12.114
As annoying as you are
when you win,

15:12.116 --> 15:13.682
it's worse
when you lose.

15:15.052 --> 15:18.620
Excuse me.
I'm not gonna lose, old man.

15:18.622 --> 15:20.121
Now, I want you
to try for real.

15:20.123 --> 15:22.123
No, you don't.
Yeah, I do!

15:22.125 --> 15:24.859
I'm gonna beat you for real.
No, you aren't.

15:24.861 --> 15:26.894
Oh, I'm sorry.

15:26.896 --> 15:28.662
Are you a chicken?

15:28.664 --> 15:31.231
(clucking)

15:36.204 --> 15:37.336
What is that?
What are you doing?

15:37.338 --> 15:38.870
Playing right-handed.
Why?

15:38.872 --> 15:41.072
Because
I'm right-handed.

15:42.341 --> 15:43.406
Serve the ball.

15:48.345 --> 15:50.144
All right.
Lucky shot.

15:50.146 --> 15:51.345
Yeah.

15:51.347 --> 15:52.646
Like to see you
try that again.

15:52.648 --> 15:53.713
Serve
again.

15:53.715 --> 15:55.214
All right.
Maybe I will.

15:56.150 --> 15:57.716
Stop cheating!

15:57.718 --> 15:59.150
It's not cheating.

15:59.152 --> 16:00.985
Yeah. You are.

16:00.987 --> 16:02.319
You're using a left-handed
paddle in your right hand.

16:02.321 --> 16:03.386
That's called
cheating.

16:04.922 --> 16:07.322
I'll go left-handed.
How about that?

16:08.391 --> 16:11.058
I wasn't ready!

16:11.060 --> 16:12.726
You served.

16:14.062 --> 16:15.227
I hate this game!

16:18.265 --> 16:20.932
That's why
I let you win.

16:24.670 --> 16:27.170
Hey, mom, what's
up?

16:27.172 --> 16:28.671
Oh, nothing.
Nothing

16:28.673 --> 16:30.039
I'm just catching up

16:30.041 --> 16:33.141
on some stuff that happened
a million years ago.

16:34.277 --> 16:35.843
Ancient
history.

16:35.845 --> 16:37.044
You know, back in those days,

16:37.046 --> 16:38.845
they would print these books
one at a time

16:38.847 --> 16:41.347
using a potato
they carved.

16:41.349 --> 16:46.185
Mom, I know we've been having
a disagreement, but...

16:46.187 --> 16:48.220
I really do respect you.

16:48.222 --> 16:50.188
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Maybe too much.

16:50.190 --> 16:51.689
Too much?

16:51.691 --> 16:53.757
You have a PhD.

16:53.759 --> 16:56.726
You were the Vice President
of an energy company.

16:56.728 --> 16:58.360
Those cookies were awesome.

16:58.362 --> 16:59.627
No, I get it.

16:59.629 --> 17:01.695
I'm great.
Great, great, great.

17:01.697 --> 17:03.396
You think there's
nothing I can't do.

17:03.398 --> 17:06.131
Well, you're not that great
around black people.

17:07.267 --> 17:10.701
My mom was great, too.

17:10.703 --> 17:13.236
She's the first woman in our
family to go to college.

17:13.238 --> 17:15.271
And you will go farther
than both of us

17:15.273 --> 17:17.873
because you'll probably
wind up a four-star general.

17:17.875 --> 17:20.441
You seem to be listing
good things in an angry tone.

17:22.077 --> 17:24.777
I don't get what
you're so worried about, mom.

17:24.779 --> 17:27.079
I am worried about
<i> your</i> daughter.

17:27.081 --> 17:28.647
My
daughter?

17:28.649 --> 17:29.881
Mm-hmm.

17:29.883 --> 17:31.215
Yeah, I did so
well that you think

17:31.217 --> 17:33.617
there's nothing left
for women to fight for.

17:33.619 --> 17:35.385
And since you're
doing even better,

17:35.387 --> 17:37.720
your daughter will
probably end up losing

17:37.722 --> 17:40.989
some of these things that
we worked so hard to get.

17:40.991 --> 17:42.957
That's not gonna happen.

17:42.959 --> 17:44.224
It could.

17:44.226 --> 17:45.825
What's that you always say
in battle?

17:45.827 --> 17:47.793
If you're not advancing...

17:47.795 --> 17:50.061
You're retreating.  Yeah.

17:51.230 --> 17:53.797
(sighs)

17:54.766 --> 17:58.501
All right.
I'm all ears, Mrs. Selleck.

18:02.840 --> 18:04.406
What's the matter?
You're not eating.

18:04.408 --> 18:07.075
This used to be your favorite
part of ping pong Saturday.

18:07.077 --> 18:09.777
Yeah, that's 'cause I was
celebrating my victories.

18:09.779 --> 18:12.012
I'm only here today
'cause you dragged me.

18:12.014 --> 18:14.748
Yeah, I drag my daughter out
to eat ice cream.

18:14.750 --> 18:16.750
What a monster
I've turned into.

18:16.752 --> 18:18.952
Why would you let me think
that I was good at ping pong

18:18.954 --> 18:20.753
when I was little?

18:20.755 --> 18:22.454
You always say people
should earn what they get.

18:22.456 --> 18:24.989
Yeah, but maybe you weren't the only
one getting something out of it.

18:24.991 --> 18:28.092
What does that mean? Maybe I
wanted to spend time with you.

18:28.094 --> 18:29.927
And unfortunately,
we learned today

18:29.929 --> 18:32.429
when you lose,
the games get a lot shorter.

18:32.431 --> 18:33.496
Yeah.

18:33.498 --> 18:35.164
I know. I'm a bad loser.

18:35.166 --> 18:36.365
(scoffs

18:36.367 --> 18:38.100
You'd think I'd be better at it

18:38.102 --> 18:40.102
with how much practice
I've had lately.

18:40.104 --> 18:41.937
This is still
about Donna Karan?

18:41.939 --> 18:44.039
You've got to
let that thing go, honey.

18:44.041 --> 18:46.374
I just -- I can't believe
I marched into her office

18:46.376 --> 18:48.275
and demanded
that she get to know me.

18:48.277 --> 18:49.809
What was I thinking?

18:49.811 --> 18:52.278
It's called
taking a big swing.

18:52.280 --> 18:54.179
Yeah, well, I whiffed.

18:54.181 --> 18:56.447
Yeah, but you know what?
It took courage.

18:56.449 --> 19:00.017
And the one thing about courage,
you either have it or you don't.

19:00.019 --> 19:02.953
And you have it.
Really?

19:02.955 --> 19:04.154
You came home
from New York

19:04.156 --> 19:06.022
more determined
than ever, right?

19:06.024 --> 19:07.123
Yeah, I am.

19:07.125 --> 19:08.958
That's right. And
you didn't quit.

19:08.960 --> 19:10.960
That's something we have in common.
We don't quit.

19:10.962 --> 19:14.530
Yeah. But that might
be the only thing.

19:14.532 --> 19:17.132
Well, it doesn't have to be
the only thing.

19:17.134 --> 19:19.134
You want to go rafting?

19:19.136 --> 19:21.469
Oh, my God, no.

19:21.471 --> 19:23.337
But thank you for asking.
Mm-hmm.

19:23.339 --> 19:25.205
Hey.
Look at that.

19:25.207 --> 19:26.239
Hey, guys.

19:26.241 --> 19:27.473
Pull up a seat.
Sit down.

19:27.475 --> 19:28.841
No, we're gonna
grab our own booth.

19:28.843 --> 19:30.475
We have got a lot
to discuss.

19:30.477 --> 19:32.410
Yeah, mom and I are actually
gonna take a trip of our own.

19:32.412 --> 19:33.844
Yeah?
Mm-hmm.

19:33.846 --> 19:35.145
To Susan B. Anthony's
birthplace.

19:35.147 --> 19:37.847
Oh, can we all go?!

19:37.849 --> 19:40.316
Or Peyton Manning's
birthplace.

19:40.318 --> 19:41.917
No, no, no, honey.
We discussed this.

19:41.919 --> 19:44.185
Uh, mom, I'm a woman
fighting for my rights.

19:44.187 --> 19:45.386
Yeah, no, no. Well,
we talked about this,

19:45.388 --> 19:46.353
and it's not gonna be...
Mom, wait.

19:46.355 --> 19:47.921
Still arguing?

19:47.923 --> 19:51.557
Hillary Clinton
continues to cause trouble.

19:58.232 --> 20:02.233
46, 12, 28.

20:02.235 --> 20:04.835
What do those numbers mean?

20:04.837 --> 20:06.036
That's my high school locker
combination.

20:06.038 --> 20:07.837
Now I remember.

20:07.839 --> 20:11.440
Actually, 46, that was
Richard Nixon's percentage

20:11.442 --> 20:15.076
when he lost the race for
California governor in 1962.

20:15.078 --> 20:16.510
But the dude bounced back.

20:16.512 --> 20:18.845
He became president,
opened China,

20:18.847 --> 20:20.346
created the E.P.A.,

20:20.348 --> 20:22.181
and made more recordings
than Frank Sinatra.

20:22.183 --> 20:24.583
12 is the number
of book publishers

20:24.585 --> 20:27.018
that rejected Ayn Rand's
<i> The Fountainhead.</i>

20:27.020 --> 20:28.519
(chuckles)

20:28.521 --> 20:32.022
She wound up selling
6.5 million copies.

20:32.024 --> 20:34.524
Now, 28 is the embarrassing
number of interceptions

20:34.526 --> 20:36.859
Peyton Manning threw
in his rookie year.

20:36.861 --> 20:39.862
Now he holds virtually
every NFL passing record,

20:39.864 --> 20:42.030
all achieved
while not once passing

20:42.032 --> 20:44.532
on an offer for
a TV commercial.

20:44.534 --> 20:46.967
One thing is guaranteed
in life, folks.

20:46.969 --> 20:48.435
You're gonna get knocked down.

20:48.437 --> 20:50.203
The way you pop back up
is what makes you great.

20:51.539 --> 20:54.039
Ayn Rand, Mikey? Really?

20:54.041 --> 20:57.442
Atlas shrugged,
and so did all our customers.

20:57.444 --> 20:59.377
You should bet
on people.

20:59.379 --> 21:01.946
They're smarter
than you think, Ed.

21:01.948 --> 21:03.047
What's this?

21:03.049 --> 21:04.314
That's Maria's number.

21:04.316 --> 21:05.948
What?

21:05.950 --> 21:07.950
Call her.
What would I say to her?

21:07.952 --> 21:10.052
It doesn't really matter.
Just make the call.

21:10.054 --> 21:11.486
(sighs) You're right, Mikey.
You're right.

21:11.488 --> 21:12.987
I'm gonna start
by telling her

21:12.989 --> 21:14.555
that after putting her
through college,

21:14.557 --> 21:15.656
she's got a hell of a
nerve

21:15.658 --> 21:17.224
not speaking to me
for 10 years.

21:17.226 --> 21:20.060
Well,
the important thing is

21:20.062 --> 21:22.295
I'm getting along
with<i> my</i> family.
