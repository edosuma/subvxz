00:02.040 --> 00:03.724
<i>Previously on Justified...</i>

00:03.800 --> 00:05.848
Pretty girl.
Friend of yours?

00:05.920 --> 00:07.524
She could be
your friend, too.

00:07.600 --> 00:08.965
You're the only other person

00:09.040 --> 00:10.451
who knew which properties
we wanted.

00:10.760 --> 00:12.285
Who's doing it,
and how do they know?

00:12.680 --> 00:14.284
I honestly don't know.

00:14.440 --> 00:15.601
How about
a starter tap?

00:17.760 --> 00:18.761
We're gonna need help.

00:18.960 --> 00:20.246
This someone
we can trust?

00:20.360 --> 00:22.601
I have a problem
that can only be solved

00:22.680 --> 00:24.250
with your wealth of expertise.

00:26.280 --> 00:27.361
Who in the hell
was that again?

00:27.920 --> 00:29.001
That's Ava's uncle.

00:29.080 --> 00:31.686
Running is a mistake.
That's how they find you.

00:31.800 --> 00:33.529
You need new papers,
a new life.

00:33.600 --> 00:35.841
And what about an I.D.?
You got a new I.D.?

00:35.920 --> 00:37.160
Hmm? That's the only way
to get off the grid.

00:37.240 --> 00:38.730
No, I don't.
I didn't think.

00:38.800 --> 00:40.165
I didn't plan.
I just ran.

00:43.760 --> 00:44.761
You should go.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.047
If you don't mind,

00:47.120 --> 00:49.088
I was just thinking
I'd stick around for a bit.

01:24.320 --> 01:25.560
Raylan Givens.

01:26.520 --> 01:28.443
I thought that was
your car out front.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.731
Either that or someone's
on their way to the airport.

01:31.800 --> 01:33.802
I'm gonna ask you
some questions, Boyd.

01:33.880 --> 01:35.609
If I feel you ain't
being truthful,

01:35.680 --> 01:37.045
we're gonna
get in my car,

01:37.120 --> 01:38.804
but it won't be
to go to the airport.

01:38.880 --> 01:40.450
Well, I'm glad
to hear you say that.

01:40.880 --> 01:43.645
Suggests you're here on
some kind of Marshal business.

01:45.120 --> 01:46.963
Lot of the guys
I knew in prison

01:47.680 --> 01:49.091
were there 'cause
they'd walked in

01:49.160 --> 01:50.810
and found their girls
with another man...

01:51.880 --> 01:54.042
In a non-business context.

01:54.960 --> 01:55.961
Baby...

01:57.560 --> 01:59.324
Did you get the cayenne
and the Henry Bain?

01:59.400 --> 02:01.880
No point making
fried chicken without.

02:02.880 --> 02:06.009
Well, how long has
our guest been here

02:06.080 --> 02:08.481
without you
offering him a drink?

02:10.600 --> 02:11.840
Raylan,
you want a drink?

02:12.680 --> 02:14.728
I want to know
about Dewey Crowe.

02:15.160 --> 02:16.571
That boy?

02:17.480 --> 02:19.005
What's he done now?

02:19.080 --> 02:20.161
A lot of things,
I imagine,

02:20.240 --> 02:21.366
but the reason I'm asking

02:21.440 --> 02:23.488
is 'cause I was supposed
to meet up with him,

02:23.560 --> 02:25.085
continue a conversation.

02:25.160 --> 02:27.561
I never found Dewey Crowe to be
much of a conversationalist.

02:27.640 --> 02:28.766
He has his moments.

02:28.840 --> 02:31.161
Guess it depends
on the subject at hand.

02:31.240 --> 02:35.131
This one concerned a little trip
I took clown to old Mexico.

02:36.400 --> 02:38.641
You know,
the last time we spoke,

02:39.840 --> 02:42.810
you told me you'd been
transferred to Florida.

02:44.360 --> 02:45.600
Yet you're not gone.

02:46.160 --> 02:47.844
That's a keen observation.

02:47.920 --> 02:51.970
Makes me think maybe
there's something here...

02:53.280 --> 02:55.567
You're having a hard time
letting go of.

02:56.440 --> 02:58.363
I'll allow it's easier
for me to let go of things

02:58.440 --> 03:01.091
if I feel like they've been
left in good hands.

03:05.320 --> 03:06.321
Dewey Crowe?

03:07.160 --> 03:09.686
Well, it seems to me, the
last time I saw Dewey Crowe,

03:09.760 --> 03:13.003
he was heading over to the
Pizza Portal, all spun up.

03:13.360 --> 03:15.567
Gonna give a couple fellas over
there a piece of his mind.

03:15.640 --> 03:17.130
'Couple fellas' meaning
Avery Markham'?

03:18.200 --> 03:19.929
Well, I can't say
I know that name.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.843
Funny.
He knows you.

03:22.160 --> 03:23.207
He went on and on

03:23.280 --> 03:25.203
about how he knows
everybody in these hollers.

03:25.800 --> 03:27.211
Crowders, Bennetts.

03:27.280 --> 03:29.123
Didn't know shit
about my family, though.

03:29.200 --> 03:30.804
Well, then,
there you go.

03:31.240 --> 03:33.641
This is your chance
to see to it he remembers you.

03:33.720 --> 03:35.404
'Cause if I'm
looking for Dewey,

03:35.480 --> 03:37.482
going at Markham
would be my best bet?

03:37.800 --> 03:39.131
Well, I don't know, Raylan.

03:39.440 --> 03:41.090
But I do know

03:41.160 --> 03:43.401
you ain't gonna find him
in Ava's kitchen.

03:44.160 --> 03:46.242
Maybe you just want me
to do your dirty work.

03:46.320 --> 03:47.810
I can
take care of myself.

03:48.320 --> 03:50.004
It's Ava that
I'm worried about.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.401
You see,
I want to ensure

03:54.440 --> 03:55.566
Harlan has a future...

03:56.920 --> 03:57.967
For us

03:58.400 --> 04:02.166
and whoever else we might
bring into this old world.

04:04.760 --> 04:05.807
Now, Raylan,

04:05.880 --> 04:08.167
there any way I can talk you
into staying for supper?

04:08.240 --> 04:10.641
Seems Ava has bought enough
to feed an army.

04:11.320 --> 04:12.970
Anyone but me
just plain tired

04:13.040 --> 04:15.441
of the bullshit burdens
of southern hospitality?

04:15.520 --> 04:16.567
Well, now,
easy, baby.

04:16.640 --> 04:18.209
Ain't no reason to be rude
to an old friend.

04:18.839 --> 04:21.649
If you want to have chicken
dinner with your old friend,

04:21.720 --> 04:25.042
who barged in without benefit
of invitation, by the way.

04:25.560 --> 04:27.289
Go ahead, but you're gonna
have to fry it up yourself.

04:27.360 --> 04:28.361
That's all right.

04:28.520 --> 04:31.126
As I recall, last time we all
gathered for Ava's chicken,

04:31.200 --> 04:32.770
things ended
unpleasantly.

04:32.840 --> 04:34.285
Well, we can promise
to keep 'em holstered.

04:34.360 --> 04:35.361
Where's the fun
in that?

04:35.560 --> 04:37.449
Maybe this time,
things end different.

04:38.200 --> 04:39.690
I'm sure it would.

04:41.320 --> 04:42.446
See you around, Boyd.

04:44.040 --> 04:45.246
Ava.

04:56.080 --> 04:58.651
Paden and Comstock
are on the vault?

04:58.720 --> 05:00.051
They're the night shift.

05:00.640 --> 05:01.721
It's the night.

05:02.600 --> 05:03.681
Where's Mr. Markham?

05:03.760 --> 05:04.886
Lexington.

05:05.720 --> 05:07.449
You gonna
tell him what happened?

05:08.400 --> 05:09.526
How many men
you think we've killed?

05:11.560 --> 05:12.686
You serious?

05:12.760 --> 05:15.650
Between the three of us, you
figure we've got a hundred?

05:16.080 --> 05:17.286
That sniper guy

05:17.360 --> 05:20.409
said he got 255
all by his lonesome.

05:21.520 --> 05:23.284
But, you know, take that
with a grain of salt,

05:23.360 --> 05:24.805
since he was a SEAL.

05:24.880 --> 05:26.450
Look, Top,

05:26.840 --> 05:28.888
he's got next to
no blood on him, okay?

05:28.960 --> 05:31.930
He didn't shit himself,
as far as I can tell,

05:32.000 --> 05:35.243
so we wrap him in something, and
we drive him up a goat trail

05:35.320 --> 05:37.687
into some of these shit-thick
woods they got around here.

05:38.280 --> 05:39.691
Okay. Choo-Choo,

05:39.760 --> 05:41.683
go get that rug
we saw in the other room.

05:42.440 --> 05:43.680
Say that holds.

05:43.920 --> 05:45.251
What else is gonna bite us?

05:45.320 --> 05:47.368
Fingerprints in here don't
matter, he was our realtor.

05:47.440 --> 05:48.771
Did you call him tonight?

05:49.520 --> 05:50.760
The girl.

05:55.440 --> 05:56.601
What girl's that?

05:56.680 --> 05:58.205
Calhoun's whore.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.047
She saw us come in.

06:00.280 --> 06:01.281
Do you know
how to find her?

06:01.520 --> 06:04.205
Well, I figure her
number's in his phone.

06:04.280 --> 06:05.611
Probably the last one
he called.

06:05.680 --> 06:07.728
All right. See can you
set up a date with her.

06:07.800 --> 06:09.370
Then you smash
Calhoun's phone,

06:09.680 --> 06:12.160
you pick her up,
take her someplace private...

06:12.680 --> 06:13.920
Why can't Choo-Choo
do the girl?

06:14.000 --> 06:15.161
Because Choo-Choo's
gonna be helping me

06:15.240 --> 06:16.810
with this heavy-ass
son of a bitch.

06:19.480 --> 06:21.005
Something else
you want to say, Sergeant?

06:21.080 --> 06:23.481
Yeah, Choo-Choo ought to
clean up after his own mess.

06:23.560 --> 06:24.766
Well, you could've
stopped this

06:24.840 --> 06:26.922
by letting me deal
with the bartender.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.525
Instead, you got to
let her skim

06:28.600 --> 06:29.840
and get me
all boiled up.

06:29.920 --> 06:31.081
Seems to me, Sergeant,

06:31.680 --> 06:33.409
you need a refresher
in unit cohesion.

06:33.480 --> 06:35.244
This ain't the army
anymore, Top.

06:35.320 --> 06:37.891
Okay? I'm tired of you asking
me to carry his dumb ass!

06:40.960 --> 06:42.007
I'll do her.

06:43.320 --> 06:45.687
All right? This...
This here's my screw-up.

06:46.360 --> 06:48.488
It's my duty
to set it right.

07:56.240 --> 07:57.401
I swear to God,

07:58.080 --> 08:00.242
looking at you,
alls I can think of is that

08:00.680 --> 08:02.842
skinny little girl always
used to follow me around,

08:02.960 --> 08:04.883
always wanting to check
the batteries in my head lamp.

08:08.560 --> 08:09.846
Guess I just wanted
to see to it

08:09.920 --> 08:11.160
you didn't come
to the same end

08:11.240 --> 08:12.241
as my daddy.

08:28.800 --> 08:30.564
<i>Your daddy
didn't die 'cause the</i>

08:30.800 --> 08:32.325
light went out
in his lamp.

08:33.280 --> 08:35.601
Light went out
in his lamp 'cause he was

08:35.679 --> 08:38.410
down there damn near a week
before we could get to him.

08:41.280 --> 08:44.443
You know, I would
lie in bed at night,

08:44.960 --> 08:46.450
scared to close my eyes,

08:46.960 --> 08:49.850
imagining what it must've
been like for him down there,

08:50.520 --> 08:52.045
all alone in the dark.

08:54.320 --> 08:55.526
Eh.

08:56.960 --> 08:59.281
He more than likely
died in the collapse.

08:59.360 --> 09:00.486
Probably happened
so damn fast,

09:00.600 --> 09:01.965
he never knew
what hit him.

09:03.360 --> 09:06.682
You don't have to
lie to me, Uncle Zachariah.

09:07.600 --> 09:09.284
I'm not a
little girl anymore.

09:11.480 --> 09:13.926
Make it a whole lot
easier on me if you was.

09:14.600 --> 09:15.886
Tell you the truth, I...

09:16.960 --> 09:20.328
I always found grown-ups
to be mystifying...

09:21.160 --> 09:22.969
More so myself since I...

09:24.480 --> 09:25.845
Got to be one.

09:28.760 --> 09:30.000
Now, your daddy,

09:30.960 --> 09:32.291
he'd have known
how to warn you off

09:32.360 --> 09:34.442
marrying that no-good
son of a bitch.

09:34.840 --> 09:37.286
He wouldn't have got any
further than you did. Yeah.

09:37.360 --> 09:39.408
Fact is, nothing in the world

09:39.480 --> 09:41.244
was gonna talk me
out of Bowman

09:41.680 --> 09:43.125
till I realized...

09:44.040 --> 09:45.530
There was a demon
inside him.

09:49.840 --> 09:51.126
What about Boyd?

09:51.240 --> 09:52.241
What about him?

09:52.360 --> 09:53.691
He ain't got the demon?

09:54.400 --> 09:55.765
Boyd is nothing
like Bowman.

09:55.840 --> 09:57.410
Yeah, he's a Crowder.

09:59.360 --> 10:00.600
Now, that's awful
strange talk,

10:00.680 --> 10:02.648
seeing as you're here
working for him.

10:03.640 --> 10:05.244
I got bills to pay, Ava.

10:06.840 --> 10:08.330
You got to buy
your own food.

10:09.160 --> 10:11.970
Well, I hate to interrupt

10:12.040 --> 10:15.044
what I hope has been
a touching reunion.

10:15.280 --> 10:17.521
Baby, Earl's all moved into
the guest room.

10:17.600 --> 10:19.204
He knows to stay out
of your hair,

10:19.280 --> 10:20.520
but he also knows
to be ready

10:20.640 --> 10:22.369
in case he needs
to take you somewhere.

10:23.600 --> 10:24.726
Ain't there something
you need to say?

10:25.160 --> 10:28.846
Uh, thank you for, very much,
the hospitality, Ms. Crowder.

10:28.920 --> 10:30.251
You're very welcome.

10:30.920 --> 10:33.651
Well, Zachariah,
what say we get to it?

10:33.960 --> 10:35.962
Could you two
excuse us for a moment?

10:39.480 --> 10:41.323
Seeing you is a tonic.

10:45.880 --> 10:48.770
You sure it's such a hot idea
hiring on Zachariah?

10:48.840 --> 10:50.922
I mean, I know
it's been a while, but, uh...

10:51.400 --> 10:53.721
I imagine I don't have
to remind you how he is.

10:54.320 --> 10:57.210
Baby, I'm fully aware of
your uncle's eccentricities,

10:57.280 --> 10:58.964
but I need his expertise.

10:59.560 --> 11:00.561
Don't worry.

11:00.680 --> 11:02.250
He ain't working for me.

11:02.320 --> 11:04.049
He's just working for me.

11:06.720 --> 11:07.926
You ready?

11:08.280 --> 11:10.521
You take your truck,
I take mine.

11:18.080 --> 11:19.923
Oh, thank God. Coffee.

11:22.440 --> 11:24.169
Jesus H. Christ.

11:25.560 --> 11:28.530
That's not exactly
the reaction I was hoping for.

11:31.640 --> 11:33.404
You gonna say
anything else?

11:35.600 --> 11:36.806
No.

11:37.280 --> 11:38.441
'No, ' you're not gonna
say anything

11:38.520 --> 11:39.851
or, 'no, ' you won't
marry me?

11:40.280 --> 11:41.406
Could you
close that box?

11:41.480 --> 11:43.721
I can't think with that
thing staring at me.

11:43.800 --> 11:45.165
Oh, come on.

11:46.680 --> 11:48.330
It's what people do,
isn't it?

11:50.560 --> 11:52.688
It's not what
we do.

11:53.600 --> 11:55.489
Not well, anyway.

11:56.040 --> 11:57.644
Maybe we could
change that.

11:58.080 --> 11:59.081
Look, it's simple,

11:59.160 --> 12:01.128
I don't want to be
married anymore.

12:01.240 --> 12:02.571
I've been married.

12:02.640 --> 12:05.564
So have you. Multiple
times, if I'm not mistaken.

12:05.640 --> 12:07.881
History suggests

12:07.960 --> 12:10.042
we're not
very good at it.

12:11.360 --> 12:13.488
None of my marriages
was to you.

12:14.960 --> 12:16.291
Oh, my God.

12:16.360 --> 12:18.488
You're so full of shit.

12:31.680 --> 12:32.761
I didn't come back here

12:32.840 --> 12:34.842
just to get into the weed
business, Katherine.

12:35.720 --> 12:38.690
I'm not asking you to make
up your mind right now.

12:42.680 --> 12:44.125
All right, Avery.

12:44.840 --> 12:45.841
I will think about it.

12:45.920 --> 12:47.684
That is all
I'm gonna promise.

12:53.440 --> 12:55.204
There is
one other thing.

12:56.120 --> 12:57.565
Isn't there always?

12:59.520 --> 13:01.010
I want you
to come clean.

13:01.320 --> 13:02.651
Come clean
about what?

13:02.760 --> 13:03.761
Grady.

13:05.720 --> 13:06.767
Okay.

13:08.080 --> 13:09.241
You got me.

13:11.040 --> 13:12.201
I cheated on Grady.

13:12.640 --> 13:14.608
'Course, I would've thought
you would've known that,

13:14.680 --> 13:17.160
seeing's how you were the
one I cheated on him with.

13:17.560 --> 13:20.131
I'm not talking about
you stepping out on him.

13:20.360 --> 13:22.089
Talking about
you snitching him.

13:23.760 --> 13:25.250
I understand
why you did it.

13:26.200 --> 13:27.486
Family to think about.

13:27.560 --> 13:29.642
Couldn't have both of you
going to prison.

13:30.760 --> 13:33.491
You think that I
was the rat?

13:33.560 --> 13:35.403
It was why
I got out of here.

13:35.760 --> 13:36.966
Figured I was next.

13:37.600 --> 13:39.011
You've thought that
all these years.

13:39.080 --> 13:40.605
Why the hell would you
want to marry me?

13:41.040 --> 13:42.565
I've made
my peace with it.

13:43.600 --> 13:45.090
Well, that's very
generous of you,

13:45.160 --> 13:46.730
except for
one little thing.

13:47.560 --> 13:48.641
I didn't do it.

13:50.400 --> 13:51.890
Well, either way,

13:53.240 --> 13:54.366
far as I'm concerned,

13:54.440 --> 13:56.329
the past is the past.

13:56.920 --> 13:59.287
Here on in, as long as
you're straight with me,

14:00.360 --> 14:02.169
you'll never have
cause to worry

14:02.240 --> 14:03.571
another day
in your life.

14:08.600 --> 14:09.681
Hell of a thing.

14:09.760 --> 14:10.966
They bury him
up here next week,

14:11.040 --> 14:12.405
we don't find him
for a year.

14:12.480 --> 14:14.881
Shit,
like as not we never find him.

14:14.960 --> 14:17.201
How's that?
Bear season.

14:17.280 --> 14:18.964
Started this
morning, ends Monday night

14:19.040 --> 14:20.724
or after five females
are harvested.

14:20.800 --> 14:21.881
Other than that,
the only people

14:21.960 --> 14:23.530
who ever get up here
are ATV'ers,

14:23.880 --> 14:25.120
but they don't have dogs.

14:25.200 --> 14:26.804
And on top of that
run of luck,

14:26.920 --> 14:28.604
we go through
the guy's pockets,

14:28.720 --> 14:30.370
find not only
a driver's license

14:30.440 --> 14:33.011
but a calling card from the
United States Marshals Service.

14:33.080 --> 14:35.731
Some murders the good Lord
just wants to see solved.

14:36.120 --> 14:37.201
Anything on the doer?

14:37.280 --> 14:39.521
Yeah, so far we got two sets
of distinct footprints,

14:39.600 --> 14:41.284
most likely male,

14:41.400 --> 14:43.880
one set of tire depressions
from a late-model car,

14:43.960 --> 14:46.566
likely a sedan, not much
wear on the treads.

14:47.120 --> 14:48.121
That's it?

14:50.000 --> 14:51.081
Well...

14:51.560 --> 14:53.881
We know the killer's got
to be stronger than shit.

14:53.960 --> 14:54.961
Yeah.

14:55.080 --> 14:57.128
At first, we thought
he used a baseball bat,

14:57.200 --> 14:59.851
you know, laid it right
across the Vic's temple.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.240
Look closer, though,

15:02.040 --> 15:03.769
you can see
the knuckle marks.

15:04.240 --> 15:05.401
He was punched
to death?

15:05.480 --> 15:06.481
Sure as hell was.

15:06.560 --> 15:08.085
Now, the marks suggest
a single hit.

15:08.160 --> 15:09.924
That guy looks like
he got run over by a truck.

15:11.560 --> 15:12.641
Ora train.

15:13.040 --> 15:15.611
Well, like I said,
stronger than shit.

15:15.880 --> 15:17.291
Place we're
still weak is motive.

15:17.360 --> 15:19.966
Real-estate brokers don't tend
to get themselves murdered.

15:20.040 --> 15:21.769
Now, we're thinking
maybe this Schreier fella

15:21.840 --> 15:23.683
got caught up in something
on the federal radar.

15:24.280 --> 15:26.089
You know, maybe that's
what got him beat to death.

15:26.160 --> 15:28.003
Yeah. So, I guess
what we're really asking is,

15:28.960 --> 15:29.927
um...

15:30.000 --> 15:31.764
How come he had
your card on him?

15:33.560 --> 15:34.846
He's my realtor.

15:42.520 --> 15:44.761
Deputy
US Marshal Givens.

15:45.320 --> 15:46.685
And his sidekick.

15:49.960 --> 15:51.610
Suppose it's too much
to hope you're here

15:51.720 --> 15:53.882
to say you've
reconsidered my offer.

15:54.240 --> 15:56.686
Gonna advise Ms.
McCready to do the same.

15:56.760 --> 15:57.841
'Fraid not.

15:57.920 --> 15:59.331
Just a
social call, then?

16:00.200 --> 16:02.248
People will say
we're in love.

16:02.320 --> 16:04.687
Actually, we're here to
talk to you about a murder.

16:07.720 --> 16:09.609
Would you excuse us
a moment, darlin'?

16:13.840 --> 16:16.411
And who am I
supposed to have killed?

16:16.640 --> 16:18.324
Well, we've heard
that'd be quite a list.

16:18.400 --> 16:20.767
If you don't mind, we'll just
focus on the last 24 hours.

16:21.480 --> 16:22.891
Calhoun Schreier.

16:24.080 --> 16:25.445
That's my realtor.

16:25.520 --> 16:26.521
Was.

16:26.600 --> 16:28.125
Mine, too, as it happens.

16:28.200 --> 16:30.931
Guess we're both in the
market for someone new.

16:32.400 --> 16:35.324
I assure you, deputy, if
somebody killed old Calhoun,

16:35.400 --> 16:37.482
this is the first time
I'm hearing of it.

16:38.720 --> 16:40.768
Say, I don't see
my man Choo-Choo.

16:41.600 --> 16:42.840
He ain't dodging me, is he?

16:43.120 --> 16:44.167
He's out.

16:44.240 --> 16:46.402
Yeah? We go look around
back, we're not gonna find him

16:46.480 --> 16:48.005
trying to hide
behind a coat rack?

16:48.080 --> 16:49.445
Choo-Choo don't need
to hide from you.

16:49.520 --> 16:51.807
You want to take him on,
you best call in an airstrike.

16:51.880 --> 16:53.041
Mmm.

16:53.840 --> 16:56.207
You know where I
think you went wrong?

16:56.280 --> 16:58.169
You hired a bunch of mercs

16:58.240 --> 17:00.447
'cause they look the shit
in jungle fatigues.

17:01.240 --> 17:03.971
Turns out, they know killing,
but they don't know crime.

17:04.319 --> 17:05.560
You see Choo-Choo,

17:06.800 --> 17:07.800
you be in touch.

17:09.920 --> 17:12.082
Silver lining, you keep
that card on you,

17:12.160 --> 17:14.288
cops ever find you
buried in a shallow grave,

17:14.359 --> 17:15.441
they know
to give us a call.

17:20.760 --> 17:22.967
Seems you boys have
something to tell me.

17:36.840 --> 17:38.524
You Choo-Choo?
Yeah.

17:38.840 --> 17:40.763
Wasn't sure if I heard
it right over the phone.

17:41.520 --> 17:42.646
Is that your real name?

17:43.200 --> 17:44.531
It's what
they call me.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.365
How come?

17:48.160 --> 17:49.650
Not really sure.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.126
Okay.

18:01.040 --> 18:03.646
Uh, I was surprised
you wanted to meet me here.

18:03.720 --> 18:06.963
Figured it was a lower class
of girl that works the street.

18:07.520 --> 18:09.568
Well, I'm not
working the street.

18:09.640 --> 18:11.244
I just don't meet
new guys at my place.

18:12.360 --> 18:13.521
Yeah.

18:13.880 --> 18:14.961
No, I meant...

18:16.400 --> 18:18.243
A girl as pretty
as you are...

18:18.680 --> 18:20.648
You know, clean and all...
No, it's all right,

18:20.720 --> 18:22.165
I know what
you meant.

18:24.400 --> 18:26.562
Good thing about people
thinking you're dumb is,

18:26.640 --> 18:28.642
they tend to give you
the benefit of the doubt.

18:29.120 --> 18:30.963
What makes you think
people think you're dumb?

18:33.920 --> 18:35.046
It's all right.

18:36.160 --> 18:37.605
Before my 'alive day, '

18:37.720 --> 18:41.441
if I'd met a guy that looks
and talks the way I do now,

18:42.440 --> 18:43.885
I'd have thought
the same thing.

18:45.880 --> 18:47.405
You'd be amazed
how many guys think

18:47.520 --> 18:48.681
that if they
talk fast enough,

18:48.760 --> 18:51.047
no one'll realize
they got nothing to say.

18:53.040 --> 18:54.485
I like the way
you take your time.

18:55.480 --> 18:57.926
It's like all you want is for
the other person to understand.

19:06.400 --> 19:07.765
You ever wish

19:07.840 --> 19:10.002
things wouldn't have to be
the way they are?

19:13.320 --> 19:15.163
You know, like, if you...

19:15.240 --> 19:17.242
Close your eyes
and open them,

19:18.240 --> 19:19.765
things would be different?

19:31.760 --> 19:33.649
Boyd,
you take the lead,

19:33.720 --> 19:35.529
and you spring chickens,
you follow me down,

19:35.600 --> 19:37.364
and don't go down
this damn ladder too fast.

19:37.440 --> 19:39.408
I don't want you stepping
on my goddamn hands.

19:41.400 --> 19:42.731
Turn your lights on.

19:47.200 --> 19:49.123
Ain't nothing
to be scared of.

19:49.280 --> 19:51.089
You only have to come down
far enough

19:51.160 --> 19:54.607
to still maintain radio contact
on that cable I strung.

20:01.480 --> 20:04.563
If anything happens, you call
that rescue number I gave you.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.001
Then you call a lawyer.

20:10.240 --> 20:11.287
'Cause we're gonna
need one.

20:13.120 --> 20:14.610
If we're all still alive.

20:20.160 --> 20:21.844
Whoa, whoa, whoa, son.

20:21.920 --> 20:23.524
You brought a gun
into a mine shaft?

20:23.600 --> 20:25.568
What the hell
you think's gonna happen?

20:25.640 --> 20:26.846
You shoot that thing
off down here

20:26.960 --> 20:28.769
with some of this firedamp
that's been building up

20:28.840 --> 20:30.569
in some of these gas pockets
for God knows how long,

20:30.640 --> 20:32.130
I'll tell you
what's gonna happen.

20:32.200 --> 20:33.725
We're gonna go up
like the 4th of July.

20:33.800 --> 20:35.290
That's what's
gonna happen.

20:35.440 --> 20:36.407
Hell, it'll be
so damn loud,

20:36.480 --> 20:38.130
they'll probably hear us
from West Virginia.

20:38.200 --> 20:39.565
Yeah, well, I always
heard an abandoned mine's

20:39.640 --> 20:42.291
a likely place to stumble
into a rattlesnake nest, so...

20:42.920 --> 20:44.331
Carl
don't like snakes.

20:44.400 --> 20:45.401
Well, why don't you ask him

20:45.480 --> 20:46.891
how feels about
burning to death?

20:46.960 --> 20:48.166
Give it over.

20:49.160 --> 20:50.286
Come on.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.286
Now look here.

20:53.360 --> 20:55.601
You come across
a rattlesnake or a bear

20:55.680 --> 20:57.091
or a chupacabra,

20:57.160 --> 20:59.003
you use this and
give them what for.

21:00.520 --> 21:01.521
Pig?

21:01.760 --> 21:02.841
All right.

21:04.080 --> 21:05.525
We'll see you, Carl.

21:05.760 --> 21:06.841
Yeah.

21:17.360 --> 21:19.647
So that's who's
in my parking spot.

21:19.720 --> 21:21.131
Less-secure woman than myself

21:21.200 --> 21:23.441
might worry you were
looking over her shoulder.

21:23.520 --> 21:24.806
Hey, it's free coffee.

21:25.080 --> 21:26.605
Plus, the docs
gave me the green light

21:26.720 --> 21:28.563
to start driving,
so I'm celebrating.

21:28.680 --> 21:31.286
If you were celebrating,
you'd be at the gun range.

21:31.360 --> 21:32.566
That's exactly
where I'm going

21:32.640 --> 21:34.369
right after I get
your take on something.

21:34.960 --> 21:36.371
Something about Raylan?

21:36.760 --> 21:38.524
Why, no,
as it happens.

21:39.000 --> 21:42.322
Wasn't the Hale task force one
of the first jobs you worked?

21:42.400 --> 21:44.050
First big one, anyway.

21:44.120 --> 21:46.487
Twenty one-year-old girl
fresh out of Glynco.

21:48.440 --> 21:49.646
Do you happen
to have an idea

21:49.720 --> 21:52.405
who the U.S. Attorney's
snitch might've been?

21:52.880 --> 21:54.086
Snitch?

21:54.160 --> 21:56.401
That case was made
on wiretaps.

21:56.480 --> 21:58.050
Whole reason why they
couldn't get Katherine

21:58.120 --> 22:00.088
was 'cause she never
talked on the phone.

22:00.440 --> 22:03.489
Yeah, I know there wasn't
ever an official CI,

22:03.560 --> 22:07.770
but Poole always hinted
that he had an inside man.

22:09.160 --> 22:10.571
Didn't you tell me
you'd never end up

22:10.680 --> 22:12.170
being one of those
old lawmen

22:12.240 --> 22:15.164
who spent his golden years
obsessed with his old cases?

22:15.240 --> 22:16.526
All right, first of all,

22:16.600 --> 22:18.329
let's watch it with the
'golden years' shit.

22:18.840 --> 22:21.002
Second of all,
this is just an old case.

22:21.080 --> 22:22.286
It's not my old case.

22:22.400 --> 22:23.606
It's just an old case.

22:23.680 --> 22:26.490
And third, sometimes
a man's just got to find a way

22:26.560 --> 22:27.846
to get out of the house.

22:29.440 --> 22:30.680
Could it
have been Markham?

22:31.280 --> 22:32.441
That makes sense.

22:32.840 --> 22:35.047
Turns out he was
making time with Katherine,

22:35.120 --> 22:37.521
still is, as a matter
of fact, or is again.

22:37.600 --> 22:39.443
That is, if I can trust
our CI.

22:39.520 --> 22:41.010
I'll be goddamned.

22:42.160 --> 22:43.491
What do you mean
trust your CI?

22:43.880 --> 22:46.486
Is Ava doing something
that makes you not trust her?

22:47.200 --> 22:49.441
I think she tried
to run yesterday.

22:50.120 --> 22:51.406
That or she and Raylan

22:51.480 --> 22:54.051
are back sleeping
together or both.

22:54.640 --> 22:56.051
How sure are you
of that?

22:56.120 --> 22:57.531
Movement on their
phones indicates

22:57.600 --> 22:59.602
she ran and he
brought her back.

23:03.640 --> 23:05.165
What a dumbass.

23:08.440 --> 23:09.771
You want some advice?

23:11.440 --> 23:13.329
Figure since you're
already here...

23:13.400 --> 23:15.084
Bring Raylan in

23:15.160 --> 23:17.845
and see if you can confirm
what your gut is telling you.

23:18.240 --> 23:19.287
And if you can...

23:19.360 --> 23:21.169
If I can, I'll have
to pull him.

23:22.480 --> 23:24.528
Maybe. Probably.

23:24.600 --> 23:28.161
Which'll mean terminating
Ava as a CI,

23:28.240 --> 23:30.925
which means we're starting
this case over from scratch.

23:33.720 --> 23:35.085
Is that what
you'd do?

23:38.320 --> 23:39.651
You'd let it go.

23:40.840 --> 23:43.491
Wouldn't risk the case
just to save your own ass.

23:45.480 --> 23:47.050
Either Markham's
a hell of an actor

23:47.120 --> 23:49.851
or he really didn't know what
his boys did to Calhoun.

23:49.920 --> 23:51.365
Well, he knows now.

23:52.360 --> 23:53.725
Wonderful things
can happen

23:53.800 --> 23:56.849
when you sow seeds of distrust
in a garden of assholes.

23:58.480 --> 23:59.641
You just come up
with that?

23:59.720 --> 24:00.881
I read it somewhere.

24:01.000 --> 24:02.161
Well, do me a favor

24:02.240 --> 24:04.527
and say it again slow
so I can write it down.

24:05.120 --> 24:06.770
Tammy Lee's
beauty and hair.

24:07.200 --> 24:09.441
It's 'Tammy Lee's
beauty shop'...

24:10.080 --> 24:11.889
But I guess if Boyd's
paranoid enough

24:11.960 --> 24:13.371
to call through
all my contacts,

24:13.520 --> 24:16.046
the name of the salon would
be the least of our problems.

24:16.240 --> 24:17.810
You all right?
I'm fine.

24:17.880 --> 24:18.927
Why are you whispering?

24:19.000 --> 24:20.365
<i>Boyd's got me
a babysitter.</i>

24:20.440 --> 24:22.329
<i>He says it's in case
Markham makes a move.</i>

24:22.400 --> 24:23.811
You believe that?

24:23.880 --> 24:25.166
I guess I have to.

24:25.240 --> 24:28.005
<i>I believed him when he said
he cares about our future.</i>

24:28.400 --> 24:29.481
Yeah, me too.

24:29.560 --> 24:30.721
It's how I knew
I could leave.

24:32.520 --> 24:34.329
Zachariah came over
this morning.

24:34.400 --> 24:35.447
Boyd's got him working.

24:35.520 --> 24:37.682
<i>I don't know on what,
but I'll try and find out.</i>

24:38.400 --> 24:39.606
I guess I got to go.

24:39.680 --> 24:41.887
I just wanted you to know
that I was working.

24:42.160 --> 24:44.640
Ava, just 'cause Boyd
thinks he's in love

24:44.720 --> 24:45.960
don't make you
Nancy Drew

24:46.040 --> 24:47.963
trying to earn your
Junior G-Man badge.

24:48.040 --> 24:50.407
<i>No phone calls if someone's close
enough, you got to whisper.</i>

24:50.880 --> 24:52.006
And thank you.

24:52.080 --> 24:53.570
I live to serve.

24:56.240 --> 24:58.811
She's back on track, huh?

24:59.120 --> 25:00.406
Yeah.

25:00.920 --> 25:02.001
How'd you
manage that?

25:02.080 --> 25:04.128
How did I manage that?
I wonder.

25:04.640 --> 25:06.881
What do you think?
Oh, I'm trying not to.

25:08.280 --> 25:09.520
It makes
a statement.

25:09.600 --> 25:11.568
It's as big as a
goddamn pomegranate.

25:12.040 --> 25:13.610
Did you know size
is only one

25:13.680 --> 25:15.523
of the four c's
of diamond quality.

25:15.600 --> 25:18.285
You've also got
color, clarity...

25:19.440 --> 25:20.680
Can't think of the fourth.

25:20.760 --> 25:22.205
You got something
on your mind?

25:22.280 --> 25:23.805
Size doesn't start
with a 'C.'

25:24.240 --> 25:26.004
Carat-weight, Mikey.
Wynn!

25:27.000 --> 25:28.968
What's on my mind?
Uh, yeah.

25:29.480 --> 25:31.687
Just, uh, you got to
hand it to the guy.

25:31.800 --> 25:32.961
He sure did
a number on you.

25:33.040 --> 25:34.121
What does that mean?

25:34.640 --> 25:35.880
Cut.

25:36.360 --> 25:37.850
The fourth 'C.'

25:37.920 --> 25:39.126
Although it still feels
like there's one more.

25:39.200 --> 25:40.531
Maybe it's five c's.

25:40.640 --> 25:41.926
Okay, you want to stop
screwing around

25:42.000 --> 25:43.206
and tell me
what is on your mind?

25:43.280 --> 25:44.725
Were you the snitch?

25:44.800 --> 25:46.928
Of course not.
Well, somebody was.

25:47.280 --> 25:48.441
And what better way
to get you thinking

25:48.520 --> 25:49.931
it can't have been him

25:50.000 --> 25:51.570
than to say
he thinks it was you?

25:52.200 --> 25:53.804
Did you let on
that you suspected him?

25:55.240 --> 25:56.571
Well, give me
a little credit.

25:56.640 --> 25:57.880
I give you all the credit
in the world.

25:57.960 --> 25:59.086
In that case,
please know

25:59.200 --> 26:01.328
I know when
I'm being patronized.

26:03.320 --> 26:04.651
Okay.

26:05.360 --> 26:08.125
Avery Markham has been
in this game a long time,

26:08.200 --> 26:09.531
watched God knows
how many others

26:09.600 --> 26:11.125
end up locked up,
dead, or both.

26:11.440 --> 26:12.930
And the fact that
he hasn't gone down

26:13.000 --> 26:14.923
doesn't necessarily
mean he's a rat.

26:15.000 --> 26:16.764
It could just mean
he's good.

26:16.840 --> 26:19.730
And the fact that he asked
you to marry him

26:19.800 --> 26:21.848
doesn't mean
he's not playing you.

26:23.920 --> 26:27.163
You want me to look into it, see
if I can dig something up, prove

26:27.240 --> 26:30.005
it was him or something
proves that it wasn't?

26:30.520 --> 26:32.090
I'm just not sure
it matters.

26:33.000 --> 26:34.809
Either way, we're gonna
have to kill him.

26:35.800 --> 26:37.086
Oh, it matters.

26:37.440 --> 26:38.930
If he's playing me,

26:39.320 --> 26:41.209
we're gonna have to
kill him slow.

26:43.080 --> 26:44.923
You don't need me
to tell you.

26:46.160 --> 26:47.764
You know what has
to be done.

26:47.840 --> 26:50.161
Choo-Choo's a rock.
He'd never give us up.

26:50.840 --> 26:52.410
Not on purpose.

26:56.560 --> 26:58.164
Feds have got guys

26:58.800 --> 27:00.131
that spend
their whole lives

27:00.200 --> 27:01.884
tying people in knots...
I'm not...

27:05.040 --> 27:06.690
Choo-Choo and I were in
the sandbox together.

27:06.760 --> 27:07.886
I know.

27:08.960 --> 27:10.803
I was in the Humvee
right behind his

27:10.880 --> 27:12.325
when he got blown up.

27:13.200 --> 27:14.565
I.E.D.

27:15.560 --> 27:17.961
Flipped them over,
then landed on our hood.

27:18.040 --> 27:20.486
Crushed their gunner
like a bug on our windshield.

27:22.000 --> 27:23.809
Choo-Choo's
in the captain's seat.

27:25.920 --> 27:27.285
We got that door open...

27:28.320 --> 27:30.641
You wouldn't think anybody
could be alive in there.

27:32.720 --> 27:34.165
Medics...

27:36.240 --> 27:37.810
Picking splinters
of the driver's bones

27:37.880 --> 27:39.120
out of his face...

27:39.200 --> 27:40.645
He lives through that?

27:41.080 --> 27:42.081
No.

27:43.280 --> 27:45.248
One morning
when I was in I Corps,

27:45.920 --> 27:47.445
we found a dead cong

27:49.000 --> 27:50.809
who'd stepped in a
punji pit in the dark.

27:52.760 --> 27:55.445
Thing about punji sticks,
they're not meant to kill.

27:56.800 --> 28:00.361
A dead soldier reduces the
force against you by one,

28:00.440 --> 28:03.603
but a wounded soldier
slows down a whole unit.

28:04.960 --> 28:07.645
Cong used to cover their
stakes with human shit,

28:07.720 --> 28:09.324
make the wounds infect.

28:10.280 --> 28:13.602
But rather than being a
drag on his comrades,

28:15.000 --> 28:16.604
make them carry him back,

28:17.400 --> 28:20.210
this feller just decided
to put a gun in his mouth.

28:20.280 --> 28:23.250
One man dies
so the others can live.

28:24.560 --> 28:27.006
Anybody can run
a peacetime command.

28:27.800 --> 28:30.804
Real leadership's about
making the hard choices.

28:44.560 --> 28:46.961
Choo-Choo, sitrep.

28:49.760 --> 28:51.489
I been thinking...

28:52.160 --> 28:53.810
Maybe there's
another way.

28:56.280 --> 28:57.327
What's that mean?

28:57.600 --> 29:00.683
The girl... I don't think
she'd burn us.

29:01.160 --> 29:03.208
<i>And how did you arrive
at that conclusion?</i>

29:03.760 --> 29:04.841
She told me.

29:07.680 --> 29:09.011
She told you

29:09.600 --> 29:11.011
you didn't need to kill her

29:11.080 --> 29:12.969
because she wouldn't
turn us in?

29:13.040 --> 29:14.644
Yeah, I know
how it sounds.

29:15.160 --> 29:16.764
<i>Is she there
with you right now?</i>

29:19.280 --> 29:20.566
Yeah.

29:20.880 --> 29:22.530
<i>This seems
like a conversation</i>

29:23.000 --> 29:24.684
<i>we should be having
face-to-face.</i>

29:26.960 --> 29:28.291
Where are you, exactly?

29:45.000 --> 29:47.048
S-sorry, ma'am.
My music too loud?

29:48.720 --> 29:50.927
Only if you care
about your hearing.

29:51.000 --> 29:52.604
That's the whole point
of thrash.

29:52.680 --> 29:53.647
Got to be loud enough

29:53.720 --> 29:55.210
to drive everything else
out of your head.

29:57.680 --> 30:00.411
I thought your generation
was all about ear buds.

30:00.480 --> 30:01.561
Sit down.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.048
Don't like feeling anything
inside my canals.

30:07.120 --> 30:08.770
First you call me 'ma'am, '

30:09.280 --> 30:10.281
and then you don't blink

30:10.360 --> 30:12.601
after I put us
in separate generations.

30:15.360 --> 30:16.566
Makes me wonder

30:17.160 --> 30:18.810
how old you think I am.

30:20.120 --> 30:22.248
No, ma'am, I mean,
Ms. Crowder,

30:22.320 --> 30:24.163
I-I know exactly
how old you are.

30:24.320 --> 30:26.402
My brother Carl
was a freshman at Evarts

30:26.480 --> 30:27.766
when you were a senior.

30:28.240 --> 30:30.811
He used to say you were
the prettiest girl on earth.

30:31.000 --> 30:32.047
On earth?

30:34.920 --> 30:36.490
First time I met you,

30:36.560 --> 30:38.642
you acted like
you never saw me before.

30:39.160 --> 30:40.844
"Oh, shit.
You're Boyd's girl."

30:41.080 --> 30:42.366
Seemed like
the smartest play.

30:44.760 --> 30:46.285
How'd you pull
guard duty?

30:47.560 --> 30:50.166
Your brother grew up
thinking I hung the moon.

30:51.240 --> 30:54.323
I'm surprised he wasn't first
in line to keep an eye on me.

30:55.200 --> 30:57.487
Truth is, ma...
Ms. Crowder,

30:58.200 --> 30:59.486
I ain't much use
in a mine.

31:00.400 --> 31:02.243
Well, ain't nothing
to be ashamed of.

31:02.560 --> 31:05.131
Leave all that
to Boyd and my uncle.

31:06.320 --> 31:08.368
Remind me the name
of the shaft they're down?

31:09.000 --> 31:10.047
Um...

31:11.280 --> 31:12.770
Blanton Creek,
isn't it?

31:13.520 --> 31:15.443
That's the one.

31:48.280 --> 31:49.520
You all right?

31:49.960 --> 31:51.371
Yeah, I'm all right.

31:52.080 --> 31:54.401
It's just been a while since
I been down this deep.

31:55.880 --> 31:58.929
I thought you worked
black pike, in that dog hole,

31:59.000 --> 32:01.526
over toward Cumberland
a couple years back.

32:02.440 --> 32:04.681
That was back when I didn't
have a whole lot to live for.

32:05.160 --> 32:06.161
Mmm.

32:06.240 --> 32:08.163
Let me ask you
something, Zachariah.

32:08.560 --> 32:11.006
Do you really love
being down in a hole?

32:12.520 --> 32:14.010
Only place I'm happy.

32:18.080 --> 32:19.161
Hey.

32:19.760 --> 32:21.683
All right.
Let's get back to work.

32:21.760 --> 32:23.125
Why don't you hand me
that oil can over there?

32:23.200 --> 32:25.282
We might as well top off
before we get on with it.

32:27.840 --> 32:29.251
Shit!

32:29.320 --> 32:30.367
Boyd!

32:31.480 --> 32:32.481
Boyd! Hold on! Don't move!

32:32.560 --> 32:33.607
Don't move!

32:35.360 --> 32:36.441
Boyd?

32:36.760 --> 32:37.886
Yeah.

32:38.880 --> 32:39.961
You all right?

32:40.040 --> 32:41.280
Yeah.

32:41.360 --> 32:43.727
Board... board's pinning me.

32:43.800 --> 32:46.724
Don't move, or we'll all
end up down there with him.

32:52.800 --> 32:54.245
Tie it on a beam.

32:55.240 --> 32:56.321
And wrap it
around yourself.

32:57.280 --> 32:58.441
Now, Boyd,

32:59.080 --> 33:01.651
don't you move, don't you talk,
don't even breathe deep!

33:01.720 --> 33:03.085
Loosen that up.

33:13.000 --> 33:14.161
Don't move.

33:15.920 --> 33:18.048
All right, pull it taut,
all right?

33:18.960 --> 33:20.405
Hey, don't you move.

33:20.920 --> 33:22.001
All right.

33:22.080 --> 33:23.206
Now, I'm gonna
reach for you.

33:23.280 --> 33:24.406
Don't you reach for me.

33:25.680 --> 33:28.001
All right? We go
on three, all right?

33:29.080 --> 33:30.491
Don't move, now.

33:31.080 --> 33:34.163
One... two... three!

33:34.280 --> 33:35.486
Aah!

33:37.360 --> 33:39.249
Here we go! Come on!

33:40.400 --> 33:41.686
I got you, I got you!

33:50.840 --> 33:52.046
Shit!
You all right, Boyd?

33:52.120 --> 33:53.281
Yeah.

33:54.800 --> 33:56.564
Yeah, I-I'm all right.

34:03.640 --> 34:05.369
Go on up topside,
take a break.

34:07.240 --> 34:08.685
No, we on...
We on the clock.

34:08.760 --> 34:09.920
Nah, after a fall
like that,

34:10.000 --> 34:11.126
you need to see
some sunshine.

34:11.199 --> 34:12.406
Hey, you're
going up topside.

34:12.760 --> 34:14.762
Hey, you don't worry
about a thing, Boyd.

34:14.840 --> 34:15.920
You come back down here
in the morning,

34:16.000 --> 34:17.570
you'll find us dug
halfway home.

34:20.239 --> 34:21.366
Well,

34:22.080 --> 34:23.411
maybe one
near-death experience

34:23.480 --> 34:24.925
is enough for one day.

34:38.320 --> 34:39.560
Goddamn.

34:39.679 --> 34:41.170
Welcome to the
dance, son.

35:13.480 --> 35:14.845
You come
to your senses?

35:20.040 --> 35:21.166
Go get her.

35:21.240 --> 35:22.571
No.

35:23.040 --> 35:24.166
Uh...

35:25.480 --> 35:27.721
Maybe we should start
this conversation over again.

35:28.520 --> 35:30.921
We could get back
in the car, get out again...

35:31.800 --> 35:33.768
She shouldn't have to die
for my mistake.

35:34.840 --> 35:36.171
Chooch...

35:37.560 --> 35:40.086
All the places we've been,
all the things we've seen...

35:40.880 --> 35:42.723
Shit, all the things
we've done...

35:43.160 --> 35:45.367
You still think
'should' really matters?

35:45.720 --> 35:47.131
I won't let you kill her.

35:47.800 --> 35:49.564
Well, fine, then.
You kill her,

35:49.840 --> 35:51.251
like you were
ordered to.

35:51.480 --> 35:53.084
Nobody move. Hands!

35:54.720 --> 35:56.404
"Kill her
like you were ordered to"?

35:56.800 --> 35:57.801
Taken out of context,

35:57.880 --> 36:00.531
that's the kind of statement
might suggest criminal intent.

36:02.040 --> 36:03.530
Everybody
on your knees.

36:03.920 --> 36:05.251
Didn't hear
a car pull up.

36:06.000 --> 36:07.047
Down at the
bottom of the hill?

36:07.760 --> 36:10.286
Put your hands on your head
and get on the ground.

36:10.760 --> 36:12.091
You followed us
from the Portal?

36:13.080 --> 36:14.525
Guess you
must be slipping.

36:14.600 --> 36:15.965
Or maybe you've just
got a lot on your mind,

36:16.400 --> 36:18.084
coming here to murder
one of your own men.

36:18.920 --> 36:20.524
Markham say
it'd be a mercy killing,

36:20.600 --> 36:21.965
putting Choo-Choo
out of his misery?

36:22.040 --> 36:23.041
He's lying.

36:23.120 --> 36:24.201
If that's not what
he's here for,

36:24.280 --> 36:25.611
Why'd he bring back up?

36:25.680 --> 36:28.001
They're lying. They're just trying
to divide our superior force.

36:28.440 --> 36:29.885
You know we're not lying.

36:33.960 --> 36:35.041
We do them both
right now.

36:35.120 --> 36:36.360
Then we hit Crowder.

36:36.440 --> 36:38.966
After that, no one's getting on
you about killing a realtor.

36:44.800 --> 36:46.609
You're really gonna die for a
guy who's trying to kill you?

36:47.200 --> 36:49.202
You can't still
be taking his orders.

36:50.960 --> 36:52.121
It's all I got.

37:34.120 --> 37:35.884
You ever been
in a mine before?

37:38.680 --> 37:39.966
Couple summers,
on and off.

37:40.040 --> 37:41.326
Yeah, it shows.

37:41.760 --> 37:43.091
You know your way
around down here.

37:43.160 --> 37:45.891
You don't waste time
looking for no chupacabras.

37:46.520 --> 37:48.443
Some people just
ain't built for it, I guess.

37:48.880 --> 37:50.370
I'll say.

37:58.640 --> 38:00.210
Shit, that's a
long ways down.

38:08.960 --> 38:10.291
Hey.

38:10.360 --> 38:11.930
Zachariah, come
look at this here.

38:19.280 --> 38:20.520
That look like
rot to you?

38:22.560 --> 38:23.925
No, sir, it sure don't.

38:24.000 --> 38:25.809
It almost looks like
somebody out the boards away.

38:26.720 --> 38:27.767
Yeah.

38:28.960 --> 38:31.201
God damn, son, you got
one hell of an eye.

38:33.800 --> 38:35.290
It's a damn shame.

38:35.600 --> 38:36.726
What is?

38:43.880 --> 38:45.120
Ah, Jesus.

38:51.520 --> 38:52.646
Carl! Carl!

38:52.720 --> 38:54.051
Jesus Christ!

38:54.120 --> 38:56.691
The girl puts Choo-Choo
at Calhoun's last night

38:56.760 --> 38:59.331
with another guy, sounds
like this fella Seabass.

38:59.440 --> 39:01.010
Harlan P.D's
hoping to catch him

39:01.080 --> 39:02.525
before he gets word
of what happened here

39:02.600 --> 39:04.443
and decides to go on
the run like his boys.

39:04.840 --> 39:06.922
I've got 50 additional
deputies on the way in

39:07.040 --> 39:08.565
from Atlanta
and Cincinnati.

39:08.640 --> 39:10.483
Plus, every cop
for a hundred miles

39:10.560 --> 39:13.040
just got a printout of Walker
and Choo-Choo's faces.

39:13.160 --> 39:14.491
Only thing
local law enforcement

39:14.560 --> 39:16.562
is gonna be for these guys
is target practice.

39:17.120 --> 39:18.201
He's got a point.

39:18.280 --> 39:20.442
Which is why I'm not starting
your critical-incident leave

39:20.520 --> 39:22.568
until after my
reinforcements arrive.

39:23.080 --> 39:25.162
Meanwhile, Tim, get your
rifle out of the trunk.

39:25.240 --> 39:26.890
Tell Nelson
we're rolling in five.

39:26.960 --> 39:28.166
Yes, ma'am.

39:29.920 --> 39:31.445
You heard
from your Cl today?

39:31.520 --> 39:33.887
Yeah, this afternoon, when
we were watching the Portal.

39:33.960 --> 39:35.962
She said the play
against Fekus is holding?

39:36.080 --> 39:37.605
She didn't say it isn't.

39:41.480 --> 39:42.686
Was there
something else?

40:43.600 --> 40:46.080
What the hell
kind of idiot move is that?

40:49.200 --> 40:50.804
I guess it don't
much matter now.

40:54.360 --> 40:55.646
Probably different
from what you're used to.

40:55.720 --> 40:57.370
It's awful.

40:58.040 --> 40:59.121
You can try another song,

40:59.200 --> 41:00.611
but I don't think
it's gonna get any better.

41:01.000 --> 41:02.525
Oh! That's loud.

41:05.040 --> 41:06.769
It's real good.
It's awful.

41:06.840 --> 41:07.887
Hi.

41:08.440 --> 41:10.841
Well, I suppose coming home
to find you two carrying on

41:10.920 --> 41:13.002
is better than what I
came home to last night.

41:13.880 --> 41:16.247
Unless, of course, you
bird-dogging my girl.

41:16.320 --> 41:17.651
No, Boyd,
it's nothing like that...

41:17.720 --> 41:18.881
He's just kidding.

41:20.240 --> 41:22.004
Baby, I didn't
expect you so early,

41:22.080 --> 41:23.570
or I'd have started
cooking sooner.

41:23.640 --> 41:24.880
Mmm.

41:26.080 --> 41:27.809
How was it
with my uncle?

41:32.160 --> 41:33.321
Let me get this.

41:39.240 --> 41:41.049
I imagine
you recognize this voice,

41:41.120 --> 41:42.167
but unless you're alone,

41:42.240 --> 41:44.607
I'll advise you
not to say my name.

41:46.520 --> 41:49.410
Well, considering what
happened last time I saw you,

41:49.480 --> 41:50.845
you really think
you're in a position

41:50.920 --> 41:52.570
to ask me for a favor?

41:52.760 --> 41:54.888
Oh, hell. I'm not
asking anything.

41:55.480 --> 41:56.527
I'm offering.

41:56.600 --> 41:57.931
Offering what?

42:02.720 --> 42:03.926
Information.

42:04.920 --> 42:07.321
Well, I guess that shouldn't
come as a shock.

42:07.400 --> 42:08.925
How much are you
charging for it?

42:09.640 --> 42:11.005
<i>Not a thing.</i>

42:11.400 --> 42:12.481
I'm just hoping
you'll see it

42:12.560 --> 42:14.927
as the kind
of a good-faith gesture

42:15.840 --> 42:17.330
to mark a new beginning

42:18.120 --> 42:19.849
for our beautiful
friendship.

42:20.480 --> 42:22.130
Well, that's a
pretty high bar.

42:22.440 --> 42:24.204
Can't think of anything
I need to know

42:24.280 --> 42:25.850
bad enough
to want to clear it.

42:26.200 --> 42:28.328
Well, it could be
on account of this here

42:29.040 --> 42:32.169
is what the man would call
an 'unknown unknown.'

42:33.320 --> 42:35.721
Something you don't
even know you don't know.

42:36.360 --> 42:39.603
In that case, I await
my enlightenment.

42:40.840 --> 42:41.887
Ava tell you anything

42:41.960 --> 42:43.928
about what she
got up to yesterday?
