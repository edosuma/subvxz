WEBVTT

00:35.536 --> 00:36.337
Ugh.

00:52.820 --> 00:54.021
David.

00:54.054 --> 00:54.922
Mrs. Conner.

00:54.955 --> 00:56.157
I know it's late.

00:56.190 --> 01:01.395
I was just down in Darlene's
room playing Monopoly.

01:01.429 --> 01:02.896
Yeah, right, and I was
up here doing sit ups.

01:06.634 --> 01:08.136
I'm not lying, Mrs. Conner.

01:08.169 --> 01:10.304
Darlene and I haven't
had sex all summer.

01:10.338 --> 01:11.772
Well, I wouldn't know
anything about that,

01:11.805 --> 01:15.209
what with being born yesterday.

01:15.243 --> 01:16.877
Mrs. Conner, there's
something I have to tell you.

01:22.516 --> 01:25.018
I love your
daughter, but I don't

01:25.052 --> 01:27.155
want to hurt her relationship
with you and Mr. Conner.

01:27.188 --> 01:29.890
And I plan to marry
Darlene someday.

01:29.923 --> 01:32.626
So if we have to wait
for a little while now,

01:32.660 --> 01:36.430
it's a small price to pay
to be with her forever.

01:36.464 --> 01:38.098
You can't use lines like
that and then expect me

01:38.132 --> 01:41.202
to think you're not having sex.

01:41.235 --> 01:42.203
Well, we're not.

01:42.236 --> 01:43.103
I swear.

01:43.137 --> 01:45.506
I mean, we still pet.

01:45.539 --> 01:47.308
Stop it.

01:47.341 --> 01:50.178
Right now you are grounded
for two weeks, one week

01:50.211 --> 01:52.112
for having sex with my
daughter and another wait

01:52.146 --> 01:55.216
for using the word pet.

01:55.249 --> 01:59.353
DJ, what the hell are
you doing up so late?

01:59.387 --> 02:01.222
They made me play Monopoly.

02:01.255 --> 02:06.427
I wanted to go to bed and get
my rest for school tomorrow.

02:06.460 --> 02:11.131
You haven't been feeding me
a load of the truth, have you?

02:11.165 --> 02:14.067
Yeah, I thought
that's what you'd like.

02:14.101 --> 02:18.005
David, obviously you know
very little about this family.

02:18.038 --> 02:20.474
We have raised three
children without the truth,

02:20.508 --> 02:22.343
and we've managed to
do very well thank you,

02:22.376 --> 02:26.480
without your consarn,
new fangled ways.

02:26.514 --> 02:27.815
Hey, honey.

02:27.848 --> 02:29.317
David, what are you doing up?

02:33.254 --> 02:36.257
Well, I heard this noise.

02:39.593 --> 02:41.995
So I came downstairs
to see what it was.

02:42.029 --> 02:48.602
And it was this huge bird that
was caught in the screen door

02:48.636 --> 02:49.503
there.

02:49.537 --> 02:50.404
And I got it out.

02:50.438 --> 02:52.273
And then he left.

02:56.244 --> 02:57.044
OK.

03:02.616 --> 03:05.553
See.

03:05.586 --> 03:08.489
[theme music]

03:57.004 --> 03:58.372
Gross.
Oatmeal.

03:58.406 --> 03:59.340
Oatmeal.

03:59.373 --> 04:01.975
I want a bear claw.

04:02.009 --> 04:03.777
Well, tough, We
don't have any.

04:03.811 --> 04:06.447
We're eating healthy now
and oatmeal is good for you.

04:06.480 --> 04:10.050
There's your brown
sugar and your syrup.

04:10.083 --> 04:12.286
Since when did this
family start eating oatmeal?

04:12.320 --> 04:14.455
Well, I'm not having any junk
food in the house at all when

04:14.488 --> 04:15.856
I'm pregnant this time,
because I'm hoping

04:15.889 --> 04:17.625
that this one will
turn out to be

04:17.658 --> 04:21.829
smarter than the other K-I-D-S.

04:21.862 --> 04:24.565
Is it too much ask that there
be a washcloth in the bathroom

04:24.598 --> 04:25.833
in the morning?

04:25.866 --> 04:29.202
No, it's not too much to
ask, it's too much to do.

04:29.236 --> 04:30.704
DJ, why aren't you in the car?

04:30.738 --> 04:31.639
We're late.

04:31.672 --> 04:34.141
I haven't eaten
my breakfast yet.

04:34.174 --> 04:35.976
There's Tic Tacs
in the armrest, move.

04:39.847 --> 04:40.914
What's with him?

04:40.948 --> 04:43.951
Oh, he's a great
big old sugar addict

04:43.984 --> 04:45.386
going through withdrawal.

04:45.419 --> 04:50.391
So desperate, I caught him out
licking a beehive in the yard.

04:50.424 --> 04:52.726
Why didn't he just
ask for some sugar?

04:52.760 --> 04:54.895
Well, he doesn't know that
that's what's bothering him.

04:54.928 --> 04:55.896
- He doesn't?
- No.

04:55.929 --> 04:57.097
He's a man.

04:57.130 --> 04:58.532
He has no insight into why
he acts the way he acts.

04:58.566 --> 05:01.301
He just knows he's mad.

05:01.335 --> 05:02.470
Going to explain it to him?

05:02.503 --> 05:03.537
Why should I?

05:03.571 --> 05:06.607
He's still taking
most of it out on DJ.

05:06.640 --> 05:09.209
Hey, where are you two going?

05:09.242 --> 05:10.611
I don't have to tell
you what I'm doing.

05:10.644 --> 05:12.312
I'm in college now.

05:12.346 --> 05:13.213
Oh, yeah that's right.

05:13.246 --> 05:15.115
I don't own you anymore.

05:15.148 --> 05:18.051
Where are you two going, David?

05:18.085 --> 05:19.920
We're going to go
study in the basement.

05:19.953 --> 05:21.188
Thank you.

05:21.221 --> 05:22.756
There'll be a little something
extra in your paycheck

05:22.790 --> 05:25.158
this week.

05:25.192 --> 05:27.861
I thought they weren't allowed
alone together in the basement.

05:27.895 --> 05:29.897
Well, they weren't, but
that was before I found

05:29.930 --> 05:31.298
out that they not having sex.

05:31.331 --> 05:34.134
And it's not like when Mom found
out that we weren't having sex.

05:34.167 --> 05:35.235
It's really true.

05:35.268 --> 05:37.070
Roseanne, it is like
when Mom found out.

05:37.104 --> 05:38.338
What?

05:38.372 --> 05:40.541
I saw their car parked
outside the Green Lantern Motel

05:40.574 --> 05:41.642
yesterday.

05:41.675 --> 05:43.411
I saw Darlene going
into one of the rooms.

05:43.444 --> 05:45.379
Was DJ there with
the Monopoly board?

05:48.649 --> 05:49.750
No.

05:49.783 --> 05:51.485
Damn them.

05:51.519 --> 05:53.421
Why did you have
to tell me this?

05:53.454 --> 05:54.655
Don't get mad at me.

05:54.688 --> 05:55.689
I'm just the messenger.

05:58.559 --> 06:00.428
Yeah, you're right.

06:00.461 --> 06:02.029
I'm sorry.

06:02.062 --> 06:03.230
You want some milk
in your coffee?

06:13.273 --> 06:15.643
You two are having sex.

06:15.676 --> 06:16.544
We are?

06:16.577 --> 06:17.611
David, why didn't you tell me?

06:17.645 --> 06:20.914
I'd have put my book down.

06:20.948 --> 06:24.351
Well, I would expect to be
lied to by you, young lady.

06:24.384 --> 06:27.855
But you, I never even saw it
coming, with those puppy dog

06:27.888 --> 06:29.657
eyes and that sad clown hair.

06:32.860 --> 06:34.562
What, did DJ tell you?

06:34.595 --> 06:36.296
I don't plan to
reveal my source,

06:36.329 --> 06:39.667
but suffice it to say, that
your car was seen yesterday

06:39.700 --> 06:43.403
parked outside of the
Green Lantern Motel.

06:43.437 --> 06:44.705
It was not.

06:44.738 --> 06:48.442
Are you calling Jackie a liar?

06:48.476 --> 06:50.410
I was at a movie
yesterday afternoon.

06:50.444 --> 06:51.845
Don't even start
with me, David.

06:51.879 --> 06:53.046
We take you into
this house and we

06:53.080 --> 06:54.815
treat you like you're
one of our own kids,

06:54.848 --> 06:56.517
and then you turn around
and treat us like you're

06:56.550 --> 06:59.987
one of our own kids.

07:00.020 --> 07:02.155
Mom, leave him alone.

07:02.189 --> 07:06.026
I was at the motel,
but not with David.

07:06.059 --> 07:07.928
Well, did you save
your ticket stub,

07:07.961 --> 07:09.997
because they're good for free
fries at the Dairy Queen.

07:16.537 --> 07:18.906
What are you doing, meeting
strange man at motels?

07:18.939 --> 07:20.407
No, you have it all wrong.

07:20.440 --> 07:21.975
I meet them at the truck stops.

07:22.009 --> 07:25.078
I take them to the motels.

07:25.112 --> 07:26.279
Who are you meeting?

07:26.313 --> 07:27.915
Just this guy
from school, Jimmy.

07:27.948 --> 07:29.883
He came down for a few days
and I met him in his room

07:29.917 --> 07:31.752
so we could talk.

07:31.785 --> 07:33.020
Right.

07:33.053 --> 07:35.388
Yeah, the advantage of talking
in a motel is that what?

07:35.422 --> 07:38.125
You can shower afterwards.

07:38.158 --> 07:40.561
Look, I didn't want David to
find out I was meeting Jimmy,

07:40.594 --> 07:41.461
OK?

07:41.495 --> 07:43.096
I was trying to be considerate.

07:43.130 --> 07:45.633
God, you are just such
a wonderful gal, Darlene.

07:45.666 --> 07:49.837
And David is such
a lucky fellow.

07:49.870 --> 07:52.239
There's nothing wrong
with what I'm doing.

07:52.272 --> 07:54.908
David knows about Jimmy.

07:54.942 --> 07:56.309
What?

07:56.343 --> 07:58.946
He's known about it all
summer and he's fine with it.

07:58.979 --> 08:00.781
Oh, he's fine
with his girlfriend

08:00.814 --> 08:03.784
meeting another guy in a motel?

08:03.817 --> 08:07.054
Yeah, cool for me, huh?

08:07.087 --> 08:09.056
No, Darlene, it
isn't cool at all.

08:09.089 --> 08:11.992
It's cruel and heartless.

08:12.025 --> 08:15.395
How can you be so insensitive to
a tiny little woos like David?

08:18.165 --> 08:19.567
Hey I'm OK with it.

08:19.600 --> 08:21.501
And so are David and Jimmy.

08:21.535 --> 08:24.772
So why do you have to
try and control my life?

08:24.805 --> 08:27.074
Because, Darlene, I cannot
shift the entire balance

08:27.107 --> 08:29.943
of nature just to please you.

08:29.977 --> 08:31.679
Well, there's nothing
you can do about it.

08:31.712 --> 08:33.313
Oh, there's plenty
I can do about it.

08:33.346 --> 08:34.347
Like what?

08:34.381 --> 08:36.349
Like no matter what
happens that Jimmy

08:36.383 --> 08:37.450
kid's not moving in here.

08:44.992 --> 08:46.293
[knocking]
- Not now, Jackie.

08:46.326 --> 08:47.194
Dan.

08:47.227 --> 08:48.261
- Not, now Jackie.
- Dan.

08:48.295 --> 08:49.597
- Not now, Jackie.
- Dan.

08:49.630 --> 08:50.564
Not now, Jackie.

08:50.598 --> 08:52.132
Dan, I know what's
bothering you.

08:52.165 --> 08:53.100
Not now, Jackie.

08:53.133 --> 08:55.368
Dan, just eat a
Ho Ho, would you?

08:58.371 --> 08:59.573
What?

08:59.607 --> 09:01.174
Roseanne won't
tell you, but I will.

09:01.208 --> 09:02.710
You're all testy
because you don't

09:02.743 --> 09:04.377
have any sugar in your system.

09:04.411 --> 09:05.646
What the hell are
you talking about?

09:05.679 --> 09:07.314
I had three donuts when
I come in this morning.

09:07.347 --> 09:08.448
You did?

09:08.481 --> 09:10.483
So, why are you being
so short with everybody?

09:10.517 --> 09:11.785
I got stuff on my mind.

09:11.819 --> 09:15.255
Dan, I am your sister-in-law.

09:15.288 --> 09:17.825
And I would like to think
that if I ever had a problem,

09:17.858 --> 09:19.226
that I could come to you.

09:19.259 --> 09:21.929
Well, you can't.

09:21.962 --> 09:25.532
Dan, I just get the feeling
that you want to talk about it.

09:28.602 --> 09:30.037
Well, Jackie, if
I tell you anything

09:30.070 --> 09:31.271
you're just going
to run to Roseanne.

09:31.304 --> 09:32.239
No, that's not true.

09:32.272 --> 09:33.974
No, not if you tell me not to.

09:39.512 --> 09:41.715
I'm going to
tell you something.

09:41.749 --> 09:43.550
And you're going to think
I'm the worst person

09:43.583 --> 09:44.584
on the face of the planet.

09:44.618 --> 09:46.754
Oh, my god, you're
having an affair.

09:49.957 --> 09:52.760
No, I'm not having an affair.

09:52.793 --> 09:54.394
Would I be in my
office during lunch

09:54.427 --> 09:55.595
if I were having an affair?

09:55.629 --> 09:57.330
You have thought
about having an affair

09:57.364 --> 09:58.465
long enough to
know that you would

09:58.498 --> 10:01.568
have to do it during lunch?

10:01.601 --> 10:03.904
I'm not having an affair,
I'm not thinking about having

10:03.937 --> 10:07.975
an affair, I just--

10:08.008 --> 10:12.345
I'm not I'm not feeling
good about having this baby.

10:12.379 --> 10:14.682
That's it?

10:14.715 --> 10:17.918
Yeah, my wife is
pregnant with my child,

10:17.951 --> 10:19.186
and I'm having all these doubts.

10:19.219 --> 10:20.353
That's pretty terrible.

10:20.387 --> 10:22.723
Dan, no, it isn't terrible.

10:22.756 --> 10:25.693
Dan, it's perfectly
natural to have doubts.

10:25.726 --> 10:26.593
Not for me.

10:26.626 --> 10:28.729
I've never felt this way before.

10:28.762 --> 10:31.431
Dan, you always feel this way.

10:31.464 --> 10:32.332
No, I don't.

10:32.365 --> 10:33.533
Yes, you do.

10:33.566 --> 10:35.202
During every single one
of Roseanne's pregnancies,

10:35.235 --> 10:39.406
you always freak
out just like this.

10:39.439 --> 10:40.307
I do?

10:40.340 --> 10:42.776
Yes.

10:42.810 --> 10:45.212
You couldn't sleep when
she was expecting Becky.

10:45.245 --> 10:47.881
You had the chronic
flop sweat over Darlene.

10:47.915 --> 10:50.383
And you were convinced
that DJ was a bad idea.

10:50.417 --> 10:54.587
Yeah, well, that's
when he was six.

10:54.621 --> 10:56.589
You're always a wreck
about the pregnancy thing.

10:56.623 --> 10:58.959
And then Roseanne calms you
down and she rubs your head

10:58.992 --> 11:00.127
and she tells you
that everything's

11:00.160 --> 11:03.330
going to be all right.

11:03.363 --> 11:06.900
She does do that, doesn't she?

11:06.934 --> 11:09.036
So now don't you feel like
everything's going to be OK?

11:12.840 --> 11:14.041
Thanks, Jackie,
you've actually

11:14.074 --> 11:15.475
helped me with my problem.

11:15.508 --> 11:17.044
Did I really?

11:17.077 --> 11:18.378
Did I help you?

11:21.749 --> 11:23.150
So what helped you the
most, the part where

11:23.183 --> 11:24.785
I was really forceful
or the part where

11:24.818 --> 11:26.119
I told you how you always?

11:26.153 --> 11:27.220
Are when Roseanne is pregnant?

11:27.254 --> 11:28.055
Fred, lunch.

11:36.229 --> 11:37.464
Hey, don't eat all of that.

11:37.497 --> 11:40.934
I'm saving half of it for Jimmy.

11:40.968 --> 11:42.402
OK.

11:42.435 --> 11:45.906
Oh, god, David,
you're so pathetic.

11:45.939 --> 11:48.308
Sit down.

11:48.341 --> 11:50.610
Mrs. Conner, this whole
Darlene and Jimmy thing,

11:50.643 --> 11:53.046
I'm really am cool with it.

11:53.080 --> 11:54.381
You know you might
not think that you

11:54.414 --> 11:58.118
deserve to have Darlene all to
yourself, but you do, David.

11:58.151 --> 12:00.954
You're a really great kid.

12:00.988 --> 12:05.558
Mrs. Conner, I'm willing to
do whatever it takes to hold

12:05.592 --> 12:09.196
on to Darlene,
even if that means

12:09.229 --> 12:11.131
sacrificing my
self-respect and every

12:11.164 --> 12:12.399
shred of manhood I ever had.

12:15.268 --> 12:20.440
Wow, does this Jimmy
kid what he's up against?

12:20.473 --> 12:23.043
Honey, I got all kinds
of good food for the baby.

12:23.076 --> 12:24.111
I got oranges.

12:24.144 --> 12:25.312
I got grapes.

12:25.345 --> 12:27.347
I got raspberries.

12:27.380 --> 12:31.584
You've seen some of this
stuff before, on the Trix box.

12:31.618 --> 12:33.420
Why are you in
such a good mood?

12:33.453 --> 12:34.687
You're not allowed
to have sugar.

12:34.721 --> 12:36.790
So you better be drunk.

12:36.824 --> 12:39.326
Listen, I've been beating
myself up about something

12:39.359 --> 12:41.428
all week and I finally
realized that what I need to do

12:41.461 --> 12:43.330
is talk to you.

12:43.363 --> 12:45.732
Yeah, all right,
well, I'm listening.

12:45.765 --> 12:51.839
Well, I've been
real scared all week.

12:51.872 --> 12:53.841
You know?

12:53.874 --> 12:54.774
About the baby.

12:54.808 --> 12:56.076
I just can't get
it out of my head,

12:56.109 --> 12:58.211
that what if it's
a huge mistake.

12:58.245 --> 13:02.115
And I thought we
should, you know, talk.

13:05.886 --> 13:12.425
Well, maybe we should have
you know, talked before we had,

13:12.459 --> 13:15.128
you know, sex.

13:15.162 --> 13:16.696
Now, see, you're
getting mad and I've

13:16.729 --> 13:19.833
just have my usual doubts
about having a baby.

13:19.867 --> 13:22.335
You know what I'm like?

13:22.369 --> 13:23.971
What you want me
to do about it, Dan?

13:24.004 --> 13:25.338
You want me to get rid of it?

13:25.372 --> 13:26.439
I didn't say that.

13:26.473 --> 13:27.875
Oh, man, this is
going all wrong.

13:27.908 --> 13:29.176
Well, of course
it's going all wrong.

13:29.209 --> 13:31.979
You're not sure you
want to have the baby.

13:32.012 --> 13:34.714
Well, I'm not completely sure.

13:34.747 --> 13:36.549
I'm pretty sure I want it.

13:36.583 --> 13:38.418
Well I'm pretty sure that
I'm completely pregnant,

13:38.451 --> 13:40.921
so you better get completely
sure pretty damn quick.

13:47.027 --> 13:48.295
Thanks, hon, I
feel a lot better.

13:57.137 --> 13:58.705
Dan said he hates the baby.

13:58.738 --> 14:00.573
He didn't exactly say that,
but he might as well have.

14:00.607 --> 14:02.275
He comes home
yesterday and starts

14:02.309 --> 14:05.378
griping to me about all these
fears and doubts he's having.

14:05.412 --> 14:06.579
I don't get it.

14:06.613 --> 14:08.681
You didn't mind comforting
him every other time.

14:08.715 --> 14:10.050
Well, this time's different.

14:10.083 --> 14:10.951
Why?

14:10.984 --> 14:11.851
I don't know.

14:11.885 --> 14:12.785
It just is.

14:12.819 --> 14:14.287
Look at this crap.

14:14.321 --> 14:16.589
I'm going to wind up
wearing Dan's clothes again.

14:16.623 --> 14:17.891
I don't get it.

14:17.925 --> 14:21.895
What is so horrible about
Dan having a few doubts?

14:21.929 --> 14:25.432
Because, Jackie, the
jerk knew for a whole year

14:25.465 --> 14:27.234
that we were trying
to have a baby.

14:27.267 --> 14:29.202
OK, it's just a little
bit too late for him to be

14:29.236 --> 14:30.437
having doubts now, isn't it?

14:34.107 --> 14:36.509
And besides, I'm
having them too.

14:36.543 --> 14:37.644
Really?

14:37.677 --> 14:39.579
Why?

14:39.612 --> 14:40.813
I'm 42 years old.

14:40.847 --> 14:42.149
I'm already tired.

14:42.182 --> 14:45.618
What if I don't have the energy
to raise this baby right?

14:45.652 --> 14:47.554
Well, you never worried about
raising them right before.

14:52.425 --> 14:54.962
Well, yeah, but I mean, what
if something is wrong with it?

14:54.995 --> 14:57.097
I mean, because my
eggs are so old,

14:57.130 --> 15:01.068
you know, and then it ends up
with a lifetime of problems

15:01.101 --> 15:02.335
and that's all my fault.

15:02.369 --> 15:03.403
That's just silly.

15:03.436 --> 15:05.105
You had the same worry about DJ.

15:05.138 --> 15:07.874
He is a perfectly
normal 12-year-old.

15:07.907 --> 15:09.176
He's 17, Jackie.

15:09.209 --> 15:12.279
We just say he's 12 because
we're so damn embarrassed.

15:12.312 --> 15:13.947
Why don't you just tell
Dan that you're worried?

15:13.981 --> 15:14.881
No.

15:14.914 --> 15:17.017
I can't be upset
if he's upset too.

15:17.050 --> 15:19.386
He needs me to be all sure
like I was the other three

15:19.419 --> 15:21.821
times so I can rub
his stupid head

15:21.854 --> 15:23.723
and tell him everything
is going to be all right.

15:23.756 --> 15:25.625
Well, so what if you've
always been the strong one?

15:25.658 --> 15:27.060
You have a right to
have some doubts.

15:27.094 --> 15:29.029
I'm sure Dan would
be very supportive

15:29.062 --> 15:32.465
if you just give him a chance.

15:32.499 --> 15:33.366
You think so?

15:33.400 --> 15:34.467
Yes.

15:34.501 --> 15:35.902
Look how good he was
when your back went out

15:35.935 --> 15:38.805
and when dad died, when you
got that really bad haircut.

15:41.841 --> 15:43.343
Yeah, that was hard
on the whole family.

15:46.346 --> 15:49.249
Yeah, all right.

15:49.282 --> 15:51.151
Maybe I'll give him a chance.

15:51.184 --> 15:53.186
Yeah, that a girl.

15:53.220 --> 15:56.689
And you know, Roseanne,
one of the magical things

15:56.723 --> 15:59.092
about relationships
is the way that two

15:59.126 --> 16:01.928
people can find strength
in being scared together.

16:06.833 --> 16:09.802
Where did you
come up with that?

16:09.836 --> 16:13.373
You said that to me when
I was scared to marry Fred.

16:13.406 --> 16:14.907
Come on, Jackie,
this is serious.

16:26.119 --> 16:28.521
Darlene, there's something I
want to get off my chest here.

16:28.555 --> 16:30.190
Oh David, a lot of
guys have a third nipple.

16:30.223 --> 16:33.460
That doesn't make you a freak.

16:33.493 --> 16:34.494
It's Jimmy, Darlene.

16:34.527 --> 16:37.830
I want to talk about Jimmy.

16:37.864 --> 16:38.731
So, talk.

16:42.235 --> 16:44.771
What does he look like?

16:44.804 --> 16:46.106
David, come on.

16:46.139 --> 16:48.508
Is he tall?

16:48.541 --> 16:50.177
I don't know, average.

16:50.210 --> 16:51.544
Is he taller than me?

16:51.578 --> 16:53.346
Average would be
taller than you, yes.

16:57.517 --> 16:58.818
Are you sleeping with him?

16:58.851 --> 16:59.652
No.

17:02.021 --> 17:04.124
Are you going
to sleep with him?

17:04.157 --> 17:07.360
I don't, I don't know, maybe.

17:07.394 --> 17:10.163
When?

17:10.197 --> 17:11.398
David don't do this.

17:11.431 --> 17:13.800
This is killing me, Darlene.

17:13.833 --> 17:16.303
You need to choose.

17:16.336 --> 17:17.204
Oh, come on.

17:17.237 --> 17:18.405
No, I'm serious.

17:18.438 --> 17:20.273
I mean I do have an ounce
of dignity left here.

17:20.307 --> 17:21.174
Who's it going to be?

17:21.208 --> 17:22.008
Me or the other guy?

17:26.579 --> 17:29.616
The other guy.

17:29.649 --> 17:30.917
Or me, that's right, choose.

17:35.054 --> 17:35.855
I did.

17:40.059 --> 17:44.331
David, you're so
important to me.

17:44.364 --> 17:46.599
I mean we were each
other's first love,

17:46.633 --> 17:48.768
but people who don't
explore other relationships

17:48.801 --> 17:51.938
end up becoming my parents.

17:51.971 --> 17:54.507
He can't love
you more than I do.

17:54.541 --> 17:55.842
David, stop.

17:55.875 --> 17:59.446
You know, if you sleep with
him, and you don't like it,

17:59.479 --> 18:01.714
I'll take you back.

18:01.748 --> 18:04.484
David, please don't say
anything else nice to me.

18:04.517 --> 18:07.554
You know this is
hard for me too.

18:07.587 --> 18:08.888
Fine.

18:08.921 --> 18:11.258
I can't believe I wasted three
years of my life with you,

18:11.291 --> 18:14.093
you cold hearted bitch.

18:14.127 --> 18:14.961
Did that make it easier?

18:22.969 --> 18:24.003
Oh, hey.

18:24.036 --> 18:24.904
Hey.

18:24.937 --> 18:26.806
How you doing?

18:26.839 --> 18:32.212
Well, I'm OK, but I
thought maybe we should talk.

18:32.245 --> 18:33.112
Good.

18:33.146 --> 18:34.013
Good.

18:34.046 --> 18:35.081
I think we should too.

18:35.114 --> 18:36.283
Because there's a
lot of stuff I didn't

18:36.316 --> 18:37.350
get to say to you yesterday.

18:37.384 --> 18:39.786
Honey we don't have
to argue anymore.

18:39.819 --> 18:42.789
I said a lot of stupid stuff
I didn't mean yesterday.

18:42.822 --> 18:45.658
Of course, I'm not
scared about the baby.

18:45.692 --> 18:46.559
Really?

18:46.593 --> 18:47.460
Of course not.

18:47.494 --> 18:49.162
I was completely out of line.

18:49.196 --> 18:50.230
I mean, we're having a baby.

18:50.263 --> 18:52.332
This is great news.

18:52.365 --> 18:55.268
That's so sweet, Dan.

18:55.302 --> 18:57.737
I'm so glad I'm having your kid
and not one of my other guys

18:57.770 --> 19:01.073
I'm sleeping with.

19:01.107 --> 19:04.110
Yeah, we're going to
raise this kid just fine.

19:04.143 --> 19:06.513
Man, you just have no idea
how much this means to me,

19:06.546 --> 19:09.249
because sometimes I
need some support too.

19:09.282 --> 19:10.149
Really?

19:10.183 --> 19:11.351
Well, you got it.

19:11.384 --> 19:12.319
I'm there 100%.

19:12.352 --> 19:14.554
I'm 100% behind this.

19:14.587 --> 19:15.788
This is going to be
the best kid yet.

19:15.822 --> 19:20.527
Well, Also what was it
that changed your mind?

19:20.560 --> 19:24.564
Well, you know, your
mind has thoughts,

19:24.597 --> 19:28.268
and that leads to
other thoughts,

19:28.301 --> 19:30.102
and then you're thinking,
and pretty soon you're there

19:30.136 --> 19:30.937
and it's great.

19:35.742 --> 19:37.610
You're lying to me.

19:37.644 --> 19:39.078
What do you want me to do?

19:39.111 --> 19:40.580
I'm trying to say
the right thing here.

19:40.613 --> 19:42.014
Well, saying the
right thing doesn't mean

19:42.048 --> 19:43.683
anything If you don't mean it.

19:43.716 --> 19:44.984
Well, I am going to mean it.

19:45.017 --> 19:48.588
I am here to support you.

19:48.621 --> 19:51.190
When you have stuff to talk
about, we should talk about it.

19:51.224 --> 19:54.761
I mean, especially
if you have doubts.

19:54.794 --> 19:58.531
Do you have any,
you know, doubts?

20:03.303 --> 20:04.103
Come here.

20:09.642 --> 20:11.544
Everything's going
to be fine, Dan.

20:11.578 --> 20:13.446
You really think so?

20:13.480 --> 20:16.316
Yeah, sure.

20:16.349 --> 20:18.150
[sigh]

20:18.184 --> 20:20.587
Yeah, you and me can
handle anything as long as we

20:20.620 --> 20:22.722
just talk these things through.

20:22.755 --> 20:25.024
Yeah, yeah, makes
everybody feel better.

20:51.217 --> 20:52.619
[gagging and gasping]

21:37.697 --> 21:40.066
[theme music]
