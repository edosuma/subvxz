WEBVTT

00:15.102 --> 00:17.887
- My name is Alex Horn.
I am 26 years old.

00:18.018 --> 00:20.585
I am super excited
to test myself

00:20.716 --> 00:23.066
and see what
this competition does.

00:23.197 --> 00:25.199
I love challenging myself and
always trying something new,

00:25.329 --> 00:27.244
and just pushing
my skill level.

00:27.375 --> 00:32.032
In the right moment,
I'll blossom and shine.

00:32.162 --> 00:35.992
- My name is Kevin Burkman.
I'm 49 years old.

00:36.123 --> 00:38.299
I retired from the Army
after 24 years.

00:38.429 --> 00:40.953
My first knife that I got
when I was in the military,

00:41.084 --> 00:42.520
I didn't like it,

00:42.651 --> 00:45.132
it didn't fit the gear
that I had, so I made my own.

00:45.262 --> 00:47.873
And then I just
started from there.

00:48.004 --> 00:49.919
- My name is Pat Biggin and
I'm from Elkhorn, Wisconsin.

00:50.050 --> 00:52.356
I started bladesmithing
when my grandpa gave me a knife

00:52.487 --> 00:55.011
that his dad made for him
during the second world war.

00:55.142 --> 00:56.708
And I started
getting interested

00:56.839 --> 00:59.320
in how the process was done,
can I still repeat it.

00:59.450 --> 01:01.713
It's just kind of a way
to pay homage

01:01.844 --> 01:04.107
to my great grandfather's
work skill set

01:04.238 --> 01:05.935
and maintain the tradition
through my family.

01:06.066 --> 01:08.677
- My name is Mike Benton.
I'm 45 years old.

01:08.807 --> 01:10.113
I have a huge family.
I have six kids.

01:10.244 --> 01:12.289
Four girls and two boys.

01:12.420 --> 01:14.770
So, being here,
this is definitely a vacation.

01:14.900 --> 01:16.815
Yeah, yeah, my wife
actually wanted to come.

01:16.946 --> 01:19.253
But my family
is number one to me.

01:19.383 --> 01:20.602
I love my kids,
I love my wife.

01:20.732 --> 01:21.994
I mean, they're the reason

01:22.125 --> 01:24.388
why I work so much
every single day.

01:24.519 --> 01:27.522
- Bladesmiths,
welcome to The Forge.

01:27.652 --> 01:29.654
Each of you is here
to engage in three rounds

01:29.785 --> 01:31.787
of timed edged weapon
making competitions

01:31.917 --> 01:34.485
specifically designed to test
every aspect of your skills

01:34.616 --> 01:37.097
in front of a panel of expert
judges that will tell us

01:37.227 --> 01:39.577
which of you is the next
"Forged in Fire" champion,

01:39.708 --> 01:42.319
leaving here with
a check for $10,000.

01:42.450 --> 01:44.930
Let's go ahead
and meet those judges now.

01:45.061 --> 01:47.237
Up first, two-time
Forged in Fire champion,

01:47.368 --> 01:48.717
Ben Abbot.

01:48.847 --> 01:50.936
Next, historic weapons
re-creation specialist,

01:51.067 --> 01:52.112
David Baker.

01:52.242 --> 01:53.765
And last,
edged weapons specialist,

01:53.896 --> 01:55.071
Doug Marcaida.

01:55.202 --> 01:57.073
Bladesmiths,
today's competition

01:57.204 --> 01:59.119
revolves around barbarians,

01:59.249 --> 02:03.079
specifically, the Goths
who sacked Rome in 410 A.D.

02:03.210 --> 02:04.907
Now, along the way,

02:05.037 --> 02:07.388
the Goths seized weapons
of their adversaries

02:07.518 --> 02:09.955
and incorporated them
into their own arsenals,

02:10.086 --> 02:11.870
and today we're going
to ask you to incorporate

02:12.001 --> 02:14.786
these weapons into a billet

02:14.917 --> 02:17.224
from which you will forge
one of these,

02:17.354 --> 02:19.226
a favorite of backstabbers
everywhere.

02:22.533 --> 02:25.623
A pugio dagger.

02:25.754 --> 02:28.539
It is believed that
the pugio was the weapon used

02:28.670 --> 02:30.498
by the senate conspirators
to assassinate

02:30.628 --> 02:34.806
Julius Caesar on the Ides
of March in 44 A.D.

02:34.937 --> 02:37.113
Your challenge here
in the first round

02:37.244 --> 02:39.811
is to use a Hada technique
to combine three or more

02:39.942 --> 02:42.162
of these weapons
to forge a pugio

02:42.292 --> 02:44.207
that falls within
the following parameters.

02:44.338 --> 02:45.948
The length of your blade
must be between eight

02:46.078 --> 02:47.384
and ten inches.

02:47.515 --> 02:49.430
It must have a wasp waist

02:49.560 --> 02:52.084
and be at least
two inches wide at the base.

02:52.215 --> 02:54.130
- I know nothing
about barbarians

02:54.261 --> 02:56.350
and a very little bit
about daggers.

02:56.480 --> 02:57.960
I've never made
a dagger before.

02:58.090 --> 03:00.571
So I'm getting
a little nervous.

03:00.702 --> 03:02.530
- You will have just
three hours

03:02.660 --> 03:04.532
in this first round in which
to complete your work.

03:04.662 --> 03:06.186
If you make it
to the second round,

03:06.316 --> 03:09.014
you will have a chance
to put a handle on your pugio,

03:09.145 --> 03:11.365
making it fully functional
so that we can test it

03:11.495 --> 03:15.586
for strength and durability
in a shield chop and stab,

03:15.717 --> 03:18.154
and for edge retention
in rope slice.

03:18.285 --> 03:20.461
Bladesmiths,
pay attention to the details.

03:20.591 --> 03:22.637
Failure to meet a single one
of our parameters

03:22.767 --> 03:24.334
is grounds
for immediate dismissal

03:24.465 --> 03:26.684
from this forge
with no deliberation.

03:26.815 --> 03:29.774
Good luck, bladesmiths.
Your three hours starts now.

03:32.386 --> 03:35.171
- All right, so these guys
have to combine those steels

03:35.302 --> 03:37.869
into a Hada Damascus billet.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.655
Hada technique
is really just layering

03:40.785 --> 03:42.526
of the same types
of steel, right?

03:42.657 --> 03:46.487
- It's a really ancient
technique of using up scraps.

03:46.617 --> 03:50.665
- We've got our smiths kind
of disassembling some knives.

03:50.795 --> 03:52.884
Why aren't these guys
just cutting off, like,

03:53.015 --> 03:55.800
shafts and blades
and stacking that stuff up?

03:55.931 --> 03:57.802
- Because it's more fun
hitting things with hammers.

03:57.933 --> 03:58.934
- Yeah.

03:59.064 --> 04:00.196
- Pros of the Hada technique

04:00.327 --> 04:02.198
is it's all the same type
of steel.

04:02.329 --> 04:04.809
The downside is that
I then have to make sure

04:04.940 --> 04:06.594
I have enough steel
in my starting billet

04:06.724 --> 04:08.726
to be able to get that
parameter for length and width.

04:08.857 --> 04:10.728
I am thinking,
which are the flattest?

04:10.859 --> 04:13.209
Which are the most similar
is size already?

04:13.340 --> 04:15.429
Get rid of all
the scale rust,

04:15.559 --> 04:18.127
any type of garbage
that will inhibit a weld.

04:18.258 --> 04:19.955
- There's plenty
of steel out there

04:20.085 --> 04:22.653
for any of these guys to make
an eight- to ten-inch blade.

04:22.784 --> 04:23.915
- But, they're short,
fat blades.

04:24.046 --> 04:25.569
They're gonna have to make
a good stack

04:25.700 --> 04:27.876
so they can pour it out
wide enough.

04:28.006 --> 04:29.704
A base of this blade
is about two inches,

04:29.834 --> 04:31.271
two and a quarter inches wide.

04:31.401 --> 04:32.489
- The challenging thing
with daggers

04:32.620 --> 04:33.925
is getting them symmetric

04:34.056 --> 04:36.667
and all four faces
of the bevel to be even.

04:36.798 --> 04:38.713
That's something
I've basically struggled with

04:38.843 --> 04:40.236
when I started making them,

04:40.367 --> 04:42.020
and it's kind of why
I stopped making them.

04:42.151 --> 04:44.762
- One of the things that's hard
when you start doing daggers

04:44.893 --> 04:47.722
or symmetrical shapes is
actually finding that symmetry.

04:47.852 --> 04:50.072
A dagger profile
is difficult

04:50.202 --> 04:51.943
and different
from a traditional knife,

04:52.074 --> 04:54.685
in that you have to shape four
identical sides instead of two

04:54.816 --> 04:58.167
to get that traditional
diamond shape of the dagger.

04:58.298 --> 04:59.647
- I've made daggers before,

04:59.777 --> 05:02.824
but this pugo
or pahuahua thing,

05:02.954 --> 05:06.654
it's wide, its longer
than I normally make.

05:06.784 --> 05:09.134
But you know what, I've never
run away from a challenge.

05:09.265 --> 05:10.832
So let's tear it up.

05:10.962 --> 05:13.269
For my stack I want
to have nine pieces, or more,

05:13.400 --> 05:15.706
so that way when you do
draw this out,

05:15.837 --> 05:17.621
you want to have more metal
than you need.

05:17.752 --> 05:19.971
Having more is better
than not having enough.

05:20.102 --> 05:21.799
- When you stack a billet,

05:21.930 --> 05:24.149
you want to make sure
all of them are the same size.

05:24.280 --> 05:26.891
If there's any that stick out
bigger than the other,

05:27.022 --> 05:28.719
you'll get,
right at the edge there,

05:28.850 --> 05:31.113
you'll get this cold shut
where it rolls over eventually,

05:31.243 --> 05:33.289
and it doesn't make
a good weld.

05:33.420 --> 05:34.899
- I am goal oriented.

05:35.030 --> 05:37.075
Goal one is to make it
to round two.

05:37.206 --> 05:39.687
Goal two is to get
to round three.

05:39.817 --> 05:42.167
Goal three is to be
"Forged in Fire" champion.

05:42.298 --> 05:44.039
- I want to make
this billet setup

05:44.169 --> 05:45.170
as easy as it can be.

05:45.301 --> 05:47.782
So I grab the straightest,

05:47.912 --> 05:50.393
most square
looking weapons that I see.

05:50.524 --> 05:52.569
I grab four of them just to
make sure I have enough steel.

05:52.700 --> 05:54.484
My mind's going
a mile a minute.

05:54.615 --> 05:56.007
I've never made
a dagger before,

05:56.138 --> 05:57.531
and I just got to get
the jitters out,

05:57.661 --> 05:59.359
get in my groove,

05:59.489 --> 06:02.971
just making another billet
like I do every day.

06:03.101 --> 06:05.365
Right now,
I've got my billet welded up.

06:05.495 --> 06:06.714
I've got six separate pieces,

06:06.844 --> 06:08.977
about four inches
by an inch wide,

06:09.107 --> 06:10.631
got it tacked up,
heating up.

06:10.761 --> 06:12.807
I've still got a few jitters
that I got to work out,

06:12.937 --> 06:14.374
but I think once

06:14.504 --> 06:17.681
I've got my billet set,
I'm going to be rolling.

06:17.812 --> 06:19.161
- Double edged daggers,
I have no problem with.

06:19.291 --> 06:20.815
I've made them.

06:20.945 --> 06:22.773
But the challenge
with this weapon

06:22.904 --> 06:24.427
is the weapon
has to be symmetrical,

06:24.558 --> 06:25.950
and you can't be off.

06:26.081 --> 06:27.735
The judges will see that,
they will know that.

06:27.865 --> 06:29.867
If your measurement's wrong,
you can go home.

06:29.998 --> 06:32.000
If you don't do your welds
right, you can go home.

06:32.130 --> 06:35.525
I don't want to go home.
I want to be number one.

06:35.656 --> 06:38.528
- One of the things I love
about challenges like this

06:38.659 --> 06:40.443
is there's plenty
of steel out there,

06:40.574 --> 06:41.749
it's just not
in the right shape.

06:41.879 --> 06:43.228
- Yeah.

06:43.359 --> 06:45.448
- And it's up to them
to take those shapes,

06:45.579 --> 06:48.146
forge all of them together,
and make a new shape,

06:48.277 --> 06:51.715
and that material management,
that planning, is everything.

06:51.846 --> 06:53.238
- Yeah.

06:53.369 --> 06:56.111
- I hand-hammer
to set the welds.

06:56.241 --> 06:59.854
I prefer to do it by hand
because I know I'm swinging it

06:59.984 --> 07:02.465
at the right weight,
the right speed.

07:02.596 --> 07:04.946
- Kevin, he did start
with a nice, uniform stack.

07:05.076 --> 07:07.644
But it looked to me
like an inch and a half cube,

07:07.775 --> 07:10.560
a little bit lean on the amount
of material for this knife.

07:10.691 --> 07:13.563
- When I know
my forge welds are set,

07:13.694 --> 07:16.087
I start drawing the billet
out length wise.

07:16.218 --> 07:19.439
I don't want to push out
too much metal at one time.

07:19.569 --> 07:21.702
I want to maintain
that thickness of the blade

07:21.832 --> 07:24.748
because I know the judges
are brutal when they test.

07:24.879 --> 07:27.098
Hot metal!

07:27.229 --> 07:29.405
, I don't know
if I got enough material.

07:32.582 --> 07:33.757
- Every time you forge weld,

07:33.888 --> 07:35.542
there's always
a chance of failure.

07:35.672 --> 07:38.240
So every time I forge weld,
I'm nervous.

07:38.370 --> 07:40.895
My first forge weld
is just a nice,

07:41.025 --> 07:43.027
light tap to make sure
everything is set.

07:43.158 --> 07:44.942
Then once I know
that weld is set,

07:45.073 --> 07:47.815
I can start drawing
this billet out.

07:47.945 --> 07:50.121
In this competition I think
I have a good advantage

07:50.252 --> 07:52.472
in that, you know,
I'm pretty adept at forging.

07:52.602 --> 07:53.864
I've forged probably close
to 1,000 knives now

07:53.995 --> 07:55.649
in the past three years.

07:55.779 --> 07:58.260
But you can never stop
learning about knives,

07:58.390 --> 08:00.610
and I want to learn
until the day I die

08:00.741 --> 08:02.873
and make the best knife
I can possibly make every day.

08:07.878 --> 08:10.054
- When you're forge welding,
it's a repetitive process.

08:10.185 --> 08:13.231
You have to heat,
hammer, heat, hammer.

08:13.362 --> 08:15.625
So it becomes one solid
piece of metal.

08:15.756 --> 08:17.366
And when you're
forge welding,

08:17.497 --> 08:20.456
its hit it as hard as you can,
as fast as you can.

08:20.587 --> 08:22.284
- When you come out
of the forge

08:22.414 --> 08:26.070
and you can see different
colorations in even stacks,

08:26.201 --> 08:27.942
I mean, you know
that they're not connected,

08:28.072 --> 08:29.247
it's not a good weld.
- Yeah.

08:29.378 --> 08:30.901
- Once I get this forged
and set,

08:31.032 --> 08:32.729
then I'll take it to big blue.

08:32.860 --> 08:34.601
The thing I'm most worried
about is my welds not taking.

08:34.731 --> 08:36.559
Because if those welds don't
take, you don't have a billet.

08:36.690 --> 08:39.257
You don't have a billet,
you don't have a knife.

08:41.259 --> 08:42.522
- Looking on the inside
of the bar,

08:42.652 --> 08:44.001
it looks like
it's pretty good.

08:44.132 --> 08:46.743
There's no cracks I can see,
there's no delams.

08:46.874 --> 08:48.963
It looks like it's
a nice clean, solid weld.

08:49.093 --> 08:52.183
- Pat's billet looks
a little bit undersized

08:52.314 --> 08:54.403
when we talk about that
eight- to ten-inch blade.

08:54.534 --> 08:56.710
- Yeah.
- Plus tang.

08:56.840 --> 08:58.755
- Ultimate end for the steel,
I'm looking for something

08:58.886 --> 09:00.931
that is a little bit longer

09:01.062 --> 09:03.281
than the parameters
in the initial body.

09:03.412 --> 09:05.022
I can then put
any extra material

09:05.153 --> 09:06.676
that becomes a little bit
too large for me

09:06.807 --> 09:08.112
to deal with for the blade
into the tang,

09:08.243 --> 09:09.549
and it can be removed later.

09:09.679 --> 09:12.334
- Bladesmiths,
one hour has elapsed.

09:12.464 --> 09:16.294
You have just two hours
remaining to finish your work.

09:16.425 --> 09:18.079
- Whoo!

09:23.258 --> 09:25.434
- There goes Mike,
working it cold again.

09:25.565 --> 09:27.044
I mean, it's all red.

09:27.175 --> 09:29.003
- I think my forge welds
are good.

09:29.133 --> 09:31.614
So now I need
to lengthen my steel.

09:31.745 --> 09:33.660
- I think that we're gonna see

09:33.790 --> 09:35.183
some serious problems
with those welds.

09:37.141 --> 09:39.230
- But I actually make
are good.e - I thins

09:39.361 --> 09:40.710
I turn it on the side...

09:40.841 --> 09:42.669
And it starts to split apart,

09:42.799 --> 09:44.584
and that's not
what you want to see.

09:44.714 --> 09:47.891
- When Mike set his first weld,
it was really cold.

09:48.022 --> 09:49.850
I mean, it was a dull red,
and you really want

09:49.980 --> 09:51.634
a bright whit heat.
- Right.

09:51.765 --> 09:56.073
- I'm wasting time having
to re-set the forge welds.

09:56.204 --> 09:57.771
That's something
you can't afford to do

09:57.901 --> 09:59.555
in a three-hour build.

10:03.690 --> 10:05.822
- We are almost 90 minutes

10:05.953 --> 10:08.303
into this first round
of competition,

10:08.433 --> 10:11.567
and I see a lot of shapes.

10:11.698 --> 10:13.874
I don't see any pugio shapes
out there yet.

10:14.004 --> 10:16.224
- Here's the thing,
the pugio exists

10:16.354 --> 10:19.836
in the Roman Empire
for 600, 700 years.

10:19.967 --> 10:21.621
So there are
a lot of variations.

10:21.751 --> 10:23.753
That wasp waist
is on all of them,

10:23.884 --> 10:27.061
but the head tends
to vary a bit.

10:28.758 --> 10:30.455
- I've got the steel
drawn out to a long,

10:30.586 --> 10:32.632
tapered, pointy object.

10:32.762 --> 10:34.416
I've got it thick enough that
I should be able hand widen

10:34.546 --> 10:36.070
that blade out
to where I need it.

10:36.200 --> 10:38.725
- Pat's blade.
Are you guys seeing a pugio?

10:38.855 --> 10:40.291
- I'm not.

10:40.422 --> 10:44.208
- The very long tip
from that wasp waist.

10:44.339 --> 10:46.210
- It's a very tall wasp.
- Yeah.

10:46.341 --> 10:50.301
- Width wise,
a little shy on that.

10:50.432 --> 10:52.564
I'm actually
a quarter inch under.

10:52.695 --> 10:54.218
At this point
I'd have to add steel

10:54.349 --> 10:55.698
to get more width
to the blade,

10:55.829 --> 10:58.005
and I don't think
I would have enough time.

10:58.135 --> 11:00.660
I'm just gonna continue on with
what I'm doing and squeeze out

11:00.790 --> 11:02.357
enough material
on both sides

11:02.487 --> 11:05.795
to make up the difference,
and I should be good to go.

11:05.926 --> 11:08.189
- It's looking great.

11:08.319 --> 11:11.235
I'm trying to shape as much
as I can with my hammer.

11:11.366 --> 11:12.672
My shape's
coming along nicely.

11:12.802 --> 11:14.674
I'm starting to see
that pugio-looking thing.

11:14.804 --> 11:16.632
I get the hips into it,

11:16.763 --> 11:19.461
but I don't have
enough metal for the tang.

11:19.591 --> 11:21.289
I got this piece
from one of my weapons

11:21.419 --> 11:23.030
and I'm gonna weld this
on as my tang.

11:23.160 --> 11:25.032
Hot, hot.
Son of a--

11:25.162 --> 11:26.686
- Kevin--
- There you go.

11:26.816 --> 11:29.123
- I think Kevin
grabbed some more steel.

11:29.253 --> 11:30.602
- Ah, got me.

11:30.733 --> 11:32.169
- Kevin made a blade shape,

11:32.300 --> 11:35.738
and then welded a tang
right at the junction

11:35.869 --> 11:39.742
between tang and blade,
and that's a weak spot.

11:39.873 --> 11:41.526
- Right, it's the junction
between the business end

11:41.657 --> 11:43.615
and the user end.
- Yeah.

11:43.746 --> 11:45.356
- Welding a tang onto
this knife

11:45.487 --> 11:47.097
will create a weak spot,

11:47.228 --> 11:48.708
but it's going
to meet the parameters.

11:48.838 --> 11:50.361
And, if I make it
to round two,

11:50.492 --> 11:52.755
I'll figure out how to
reinforce that weak spot.

11:52.886 --> 11:55.715
- I'm watching Alex right now
use the horn of the anvil

11:55.845 --> 11:57.629
and a hammer
to create that wasp waist.

11:57.760 --> 11:59.501
- Yeah.

11:59.631 --> 12:01.764
- So right now, I just
finished forging my blade.

12:01.895 --> 12:02.983
Next, I'm going to get
the profile

12:03.113 --> 12:04.767
of the knife on the grinder,

12:04.898 --> 12:07.378
maybe add a little bit of
beveling before heat treat.

12:07.509 --> 12:09.380
But I did a lot of it
with the forging,

12:09.511 --> 12:11.382
so I shouldn't have too much
to do on grinding.

12:11.513 --> 12:14.081
- His profile is spot on.

12:14.211 --> 12:16.039
- It's feeling really good,
it's got a nice weight to it.

12:16.170 --> 12:17.998
I think it should do
really good in the chop test.

12:18.128 --> 12:19.956
Plenty of strength
in the tip for a stab.

12:20.087 --> 12:21.871
So I'm feeling all right.

12:25.483 --> 12:27.790
- I don't know
the quality of his welds,

12:27.921 --> 12:30.488
but Mike has really been able
to draw that metal out,

12:30.619 --> 12:32.447
and he's got
a great pugio shape.

12:32.577 --> 12:34.318
- Yeah.
- Okay.

12:34.449 --> 12:36.059
- My blade's
coming together great.

12:36.190 --> 12:37.757
I think that my point
isn't quite as drastic

12:37.887 --> 12:39.628
as some of my competitors,

12:39.759 --> 12:42.544
but I think that mine
looks more like the example.

12:42.674 --> 12:45.895
It's ugly, but it's good.

12:46.026 --> 12:47.723
- Bladesmiths!

12:47.854 --> 12:50.465
30 minutes remaining
in the round.

12:50.595 --> 12:52.946
- I see that my tang is
delaminating at the very end,

12:53.076 --> 12:54.861
but I think I have
enough steel to cut off

12:54.991 --> 12:57.733
that delaminated
part of the tang.

12:57.864 --> 12:59.779
So my knife's finally ready
for heat treat,

12:59.909 --> 13:03.565
and the one thing I do not want
to do is overheat this steel.

13:03.695 --> 13:05.045
I just spent so much time
forging it.

13:05.175 --> 13:08.048
I want to quench this
as perfectly as I can.

13:08.178 --> 13:09.832
So I'm just moving it back
and forth to try

13:09.963 --> 13:13.357
and even this heat out.

13:13.488 --> 13:17.144
- Alex did manage to do
a period-correct Caesar quench.

13:17.274 --> 13:18.798
- Caesar quench?
- Yes.

13:18.928 --> 13:21.496
He stabbed that forge 23 times,
moving it in and out,

13:21.626 --> 13:23.280
before he went to the oil.

13:23.411 --> 13:25.326
- My knife's looking
pretty straight.

13:25.456 --> 13:28.111
It sounds hard, it looks hard.
I'm feeling good.

13:29.591 --> 13:31.288
- Well, this is what
I've got so far.

13:31.419 --> 13:33.073
I've got to go into
the heat treat

13:33.203 --> 13:36.728
and then do a little
more finish grinding.

13:36.859 --> 13:39.470
- Kevin just
quenched his blade.

13:39.601 --> 13:41.211
- He's file-testing it.

13:41.342 --> 13:43.039
- Yeah.
- That was quick.

13:43.170 --> 13:44.649
- That was very fast.

13:44.780 --> 13:47.609
- You've got to be
kidding me.

13:47.739 --> 13:49.785
Half of it's heat treated,
half of it's not.

13:49.916 --> 13:52.092
That is bad news.

13:52.222 --> 13:55.443
On the second heat treat,
I bring it up to cherry red,

13:55.573 --> 13:57.271
and I got the same
problem again.

13:57.401 --> 14:00.404
- Kevin may be file checking
while it's still hot

14:00.535 --> 14:01.797
and thinking
it didn't get hard.

14:01.928 --> 14:03.886
So going for another quench,
and then another quench.

14:04.017 --> 14:06.062
- Oh, that makes sense.

14:06.193 --> 14:07.977
- I'm starting to feel
the pressure.

14:08.108 --> 14:09.936
I know I got to get
on that grinder

14:10.066 --> 14:11.894
to start getting
this thing cleaned up.

14:12.025 --> 14:13.591
- The tip looks very hot.
- Yeah.

14:13.722 --> 14:15.158
- Come on, dude.

14:18.553 --> 14:20.424
- Nope.
What the hell's going on?

14:20.555 --> 14:21.643
I don't know what I'm
doing wrong here.

14:27.649 --> 14:29.433
Oh, she's hard now.

14:29.564 --> 14:32.132
Whew.
I'm good. I'm good.

14:33.916 --> 14:36.963
- Looks like Pat's gonna start
his heat-treat process.

14:37.093 --> 14:38.660
- Yeah, he's got it in
tang first,

14:38.790 --> 14:40.314
so he's not
overheating the tip.

14:40.444 --> 14:41.837
That's good.

14:45.232 --> 14:46.886
- Looks good and straight.

14:47.016 --> 14:50.324
I'm gonna take it over to the
grinder, finish up my profile.

14:50.454 --> 14:52.935
- I don't know how
Pat's going to a grinder.

14:53.066 --> 14:56.634
You can't grind metal
onto a blade.

14:56.765 --> 14:59.115
- A very subtle wasp waist.

14:59.246 --> 15:01.291
- Like he's making
a metal Christmas tree.

15:04.294 --> 15:07.471
- The heat treat/the quench
is what hardens your blade

15:07.602 --> 15:10.866
so that when you do chopping or
cutting, it'll keep its edge.

15:10.997 --> 15:13.347
So I need it to be
fully hardened.

15:15.001 --> 15:18.439
Perfect.

15:18.569 --> 15:20.745
- Mike's really bringing it
home with his shape, I think.

15:20.876 --> 15:22.660
- Yeah.

15:27.839 --> 15:29.015
-Ten seconds!

15:29.145 --> 15:30.581
- Yeah.
- Not pretty but--

15:30.712 --> 15:32.192
- It'll work.

15:32.322 --> 15:37.414
-Five, four, three, two, one.

15:37.545 --> 15:39.025
Bladesmiths,
shut down your machines,

15:39.155 --> 15:41.549
drop your tools,
stop what you're doing.

15:41.679 --> 15:44.073
This first round of
bladesmithing competition

15:44.204 --> 15:45.988
is over.

15:46.119 --> 15:47.076
- Yeah, boys.

15:47.207 --> 15:48.860
- Whoo!

15:51.863 --> 15:53.082
- I feel good about
turning my blade in

15:53.213 --> 15:54.214
looking the way it does.

15:54.344 --> 15:56.172
I feel like
I've hit the parameters.

15:56.303 --> 15:59.610
I have a good working knife.

15:59.741 --> 16:00.960
- All right, bladesmiths,

16:01.090 --> 16:02.570
in this first round
of competition,

16:02.700 --> 16:05.007
we asked you
to produce a pugio

16:05.138 --> 16:06.661
between eight and ten
inches in length.

16:06.791 --> 16:07.967
Now, the judges want to see

16:08.097 --> 16:09.664
what you've done
with yourselves.

16:09.794 --> 16:10.970
Mike, you're up first.

16:11.100 --> 16:13.885
Please present your pugio
to the judges.

16:17.150 --> 16:20.022
- Well, Mike, the profile
is pretty Pugi-esque.

16:20.153 --> 16:22.198
There is a wasp waist here.

16:22.329 --> 16:25.549
There is a nice flair,
front and back.

16:25.680 --> 16:28.509
Yeah, it's
a good-looking blade.

16:28.639 --> 16:29.901
- All right Kevin,
you're up.

16:30.032 --> 16:32.078
Please present your blade
to the judges.

16:33.818 --> 16:35.429
- I like the fact
you've got the waist here,

16:35.559 --> 16:37.387
I like the fact you've got
the pronounced shoulders here.

16:37.518 --> 16:38.954
You know,
that tip meandering over,

16:39.085 --> 16:42.610
that's hard to get my eyes
around that hard lean.

16:42.740 --> 16:46.918
Where you did weld
on this added tang,

16:47.049 --> 16:51.053
I can see
the top edge of that weld.

16:51.184 --> 16:53.882
You've kind of built
in a questionable spot.

16:54.013 --> 16:56.667
So I would do everything
you can to reinforce that area

16:56.798 --> 16:58.756
if you move forward.

16:58.887 --> 17:00.584
- Roger that.
- Alex, you're up next.

17:00.715 --> 17:03.587
Please present your blade
to the judges.

17:05.807 --> 17:08.984
- Well, Alex, this is
a really good pugio shape.

17:09.115 --> 17:11.465
You captured the essence
of the knife very well.

17:11.595 --> 17:13.119
The only thing that
gives me pause

17:13.249 --> 17:16.992
is that there's
not a lot of tang here.

17:17.123 --> 17:18.733
It's right to the end
of my hand.

17:18.863 --> 17:20.822
So, if you're gonna put pommel
on it, or anything like that,

17:20.952 --> 17:23.303
it's gonna need
to be extended somehow,

17:23.433 --> 17:25.609
but, other than that,
well done.

17:25.740 --> 17:26.784
- Thank you.

17:26.915 --> 17:28.525
- Pat...

17:28.656 --> 17:31.354
unfortunately the judges
won't be evaluating your work

17:31.485 --> 17:33.835
because your blade failed
to meet parameters.

17:35.793 --> 17:37.708
It is an inch and
seven-eighths at the base

17:37.839 --> 17:40.059
and falls short of our
two-inch minimum requirement.

17:40.189 --> 17:41.712
And, for that reason,

17:41.843 --> 17:43.845
I'd like to ask you to please
surrender your blade.

17:45.412 --> 17:47.283
- A little disappointed,

17:47.414 --> 17:49.416
but I gave it the best try
I could for the time I had.

17:49.546 --> 17:52.288
My blade was under parameters
on the shoulders.

17:52.419 --> 17:54.029
I even tried to re-widen it,

17:54.160 --> 17:55.596
and when I was doing
my final grinding,

17:55.726 --> 17:57.119
I must have just taken
a little bit more off the edge

17:57.250 --> 17:58.903
than I really thought.

17:59.034 --> 18:01.036
But I'm planning on making
a pugio when I get home

18:01.167 --> 18:02.733
because it bothers me

18:02.864 --> 18:04.953
that I missed
the mark on daggers,

18:05.084 --> 18:07.825
and now I'm obsessed
with trying to figure out

18:07.956 --> 18:09.218
how to do it the right way.

18:12.003 --> 18:14.049
- Bladesmiths,
congratulations.

18:14.180 --> 18:15.398
You guys have made it

18:15.529 --> 18:16.921
to the second round
of this competition,

18:17.052 --> 18:18.575
and now that those blades
have been tempered,

18:18.706 --> 18:19.968
it's time to make them
fully funconal pugios

18:20.099 --> 18:21.970
by attaching handles to them

18:22.101 --> 18:24.886
and correcting the deficiencies
from the first round.

18:25.016 --> 18:26.583
In addition to a handle,

18:26.714 --> 18:28.281
you must have a medallion
in the handle,

18:28.411 --> 18:31.022
you must have a guard,
and you must have a pommel.

18:31.153 --> 18:33.024
Failure to do so means
immediate dismissal

18:33.155 --> 18:34.591
from this forge
with no deliberation.

18:34.722 --> 18:36.506
You'll have just two hours

18:36.637 --> 18:38.334
in which to complete
all this work.

18:38.465 --> 18:40.858
After this round, your blades
will be tested for strength

18:40.989 --> 18:44.210
and durability
in a shield stab and slice

18:44.340 --> 18:47.343
and for edge retention
in a rope slice.

18:47.474 --> 18:49.911
Good luck, bladesmiths,
your two hours starts now.

18:52.522 --> 18:54.916
Okay, so these guys
have just two hours

18:55.046 --> 18:57.136
to attach these handles
with medallions,

18:57.266 --> 18:59.355
with disk pommels
and with guards.

18:59.486 --> 19:01.096
- You know, it's funny,
the medallion

19:01.227 --> 19:02.793
is gonna be the weirdest
little trip up,

19:02.924 --> 19:04.621
'cause it's either
gonna be really easy,

19:04.752 --> 19:05.927
you make one out of sheet,

19:06.057 --> 19:07.276
you stick it on either side
and you're done;

19:07.407 --> 19:09.278
or you make a more solid one
like the example is.

19:09.409 --> 19:11.237
Now you have
some fiddly fitting up

19:11.367 --> 19:13.282
of the handle materials
to get it all to sit up right.

19:13.413 --> 19:15.545
- All right.
- Yeah.

19:15.676 --> 19:18.722
So, I made it
to round two, check.

19:18.853 --> 19:20.507
Now I need to bring the tip

19:20.637 --> 19:22.596
back to the center
of the blade.

19:22.726 --> 19:25.338
If I was gonna take out Caesar
with a crooked blade,

19:25.468 --> 19:27.992
I'd be the embarrassment
of the entire Roman Empire.

19:28.123 --> 19:30.734
So I've got to have
a straight blade.

19:30.865 --> 19:35.130
I'm grinding off
the one edge of the blade

19:35.261 --> 19:38.786
until that tip slowly moves
back to the center.

19:38.916 --> 19:41.267
- I do see a lot
of good sparks in there,

19:41.397 --> 19:43.182
so he's really
grinding in there.

19:43.312 --> 19:46.141
Hopefully just one side
to match the other.

19:46.272 --> 19:48.752
- Oops.

19:50.406 --> 19:52.016
- So I'm feeling okay
about my blade,

19:52.147 --> 19:54.062
but there's so much
handle work to do

19:54.193 --> 19:57.674
that it's just insane
trying to do it in two hours.

19:57.805 --> 20:00.329
First thing I'm doing is
laying out my handle materials

20:00.460 --> 20:02.766
to see how much tang
I need to add on.

20:02.897 --> 20:04.551
- Alex's tang was short,

20:04.681 --> 20:06.596
so he's over there dropping
beads like it's Mardi Gras.

20:10.731 --> 20:12.733
- Alex has taken
a very hot weld

20:12.863 --> 20:14.517
and quenched
that weld in water.

20:14.648 --> 20:15.823
- No!
- Oh, yeah.

20:15.953 --> 20:17.477
- I know not to do that.

20:17.607 --> 20:20.262
- Welding something,
with the heat at that area,

20:20.393 --> 20:22.482
cooling it off with water is
gonna make it hard and brittle,

20:22.612 --> 20:24.919
and they break.

20:25.049 --> 20:26.877
- No, there we go.

20:27.008 --> 20:28.444
I'm so excited
to be in round two.

20:28.575 --> 20:31.055
But, uh, I got
ten hours of work

20:31.186 --> 20:33.144
I got to do in two hours,
I don't know.

20:33.275 --> 20:34.494
There it is.

20:34.624 --> 20:35.886
I need to put a guard on.

20:36.017 --> 20:39.238
I'm going with a thin
piece of brass.

20:39.368 --> 20:41.240
- The guard and the pommel,

20:41.370 --> 20:43.067
should it be made out
of brass or bronze?

20:43.198 --> 20:45.200
- I think brass or bronze
would have been,

20:45.331 --> 20:46.332
uh, would have been correct
for the period.

20:46.462 --> 20:47.724
I would probably
go with that,

20:47.855 --> 20:49.596
and it's easier to file
and fit up.

20:49.726 --> 20:51.250
- All right.

20:51.380 --> 20:52.555
- Not beautiful,
but it works.

20:52.686 --> 20:54.905
- Bladesmiths,
one hour has elapsed.

20:55.036 --> 20:57.430
You have just one hour
remaining to finish your work.

20:58.953 --> 21:01.825
- Fixing the tip
put me way behind.

21:01.956 --> 21:05.525
The plan is to get
a block of brass

21:05.655 --> 21:08.571
and plunge a hole down
the middle of it

21:08.702 --> 21:11.966
so that the tang can snugly
fit into it to reinforce

21:12.096 --> 21:15.491
that weak weld point
when I welded on the tang.

21:15.622 --> 21:17.711
So close, so close.

21:19.016 --> 21:21.541
Oh, mother of pearl.

21:21.671 --> 21:23.804
I get the guard
somewhat firmly attached,

21:23.934 --> 21:27.242
then I move on to
the medallion and the pommel.

21:27.373 --> 21:30.680
I cut off four pieces
of this brass round stock,

21:30.811 --> 21:32.421
and I'm gonna use two pieces
for my pommel

21:32.552 --> 21:35.032
and two pieces
for my medallion.

21:35.163 --> 21:38.035
Sexy is not what
I'm going for right now.

21:38.166 --> 21:40.168
But then again,
you got this.

21:40.299 --> 21:41.561
- I've got my guard
fitted up,

21:41.691 --> 21:43.606
and I'm gonna start
building this handle.

21:43.737 --> 21:46.479
I need to get a top piece
of wood, the medallion,

21:46.609 --> 21:48.437
bottom piece of wood,
and the pommel fitted up

21:48.568 --> 21:50.091
before I can even glue
and start grinding.

21:52.702 --> 21:54.487
I get these pieces fitted up

21:54.617 --> 21:56.489
and I just really need
to get these holes drilled

21:56.619 --> 21:59.013
so I can pin my medallion,
lock my handle up,

21:59.143 --> 22:01.929
and then get it ground.

22:02.059 --> 22:04.366
- Okay, that not work.

22:04.497 --> 22:06.325
- Is he drilling all of
his layers in one shot or--

22:06.455 --> 22:07.500
- Yeah.

22:07.630 --> 22:09.066
- I can feel the drill bit

22:09.197 --> 22:11.112
start to move
through the steel.

22:11.242 --> 22:12.853
- Alex is working with
some really big drill bits.

22:12.983 --> 22:15.159
Hopefully he hasn't thinned out
his handle material enough

22:15.290 --> 22:16.552
that it's gonna be weak.

22:16.683 --> 22:18.380
- Right.

22:19.076 --> 22:21.383
all: Ohh!

22:22.863 --> 22:24.299
- So I start drilling,

22:24.430 --> 22:27.824
and the tang that
I welded on breaks off.

22:27.955 --> 22:29.652
- 30 minutes, bladesmiths!

22:29.783 --> 22:32.307
- Luckily, my epoxy
hasn't fully cured yet.

22:32.438 --> 22:34.048
So I pull off
that second piece

22:34.178 --> 22:35.658
and rush over to the welder

22:35.789 --> 22:38.139
and try and tack
this tang back on.

22:38.269 --> 22:39.749
- It's unfortunate.

22:39.880 --> 22:41.969
Alex did that final weld
and then quenched it.

22:42.099 --> 22:45.015
You know, that makes
for a really brittle area.

22:45.146 --> 22:47.235
- I'm freaking out
that I'm not actually

22:47.366 --> 22:49.106
going to be able
to finish a knife.

22:51.544 --> 22:53.154
- Are you kidding me?

22:53.284 --> 22:54.677
So as I'm grinding it out,

22:54.808 --> 22:56.723
I find a small hole
in my wood handle.

22:56.853 --> 22:58.028
Look at that.

22:58.159 --> 23:01.075
So I fill it with epoxy.

23:01.205 --> 23:03.207
I'm filling the holes,
I'm covering the handle.

23:03.338 --> 23:06.820
Whatever it is, it is now
an epoxy-handled knife.

23:06.950 --> 23:09.388
- It's dripping
epoxy off of it.

23:09.518 --> 23:11.390
It's, like, oozing
off the of blade.

23:11.520 --> 23:14.218
- But that's just it, you
can't fill a hole with epoxy

23:14.349 --> 23:15.959
and then let it sit sideways.

23:16.090 --> 23:17.613
The epoxy will run out
of the hole.

23:19.528 --> 23:22.096
- These medallions
are killing me.

23:22.226 --> 23:23.924
Time's ticking away.

23:24.054 --> 23:26.405
I still got to throw
a handle onto it.

23:26.535 --> 23:29.582
- Kevin's handle is literally
just the metal pieces.

23:29.712 --> 23:31.758
- I grab some deer leather

23:31.888 --> 23:33.934
and I start
cutting strips of it,

23:34.064 --> 23:35.501
and I just start
slapping glue on it.

23:35.631 --> 23:37.024
Stretching it
and wrapping it,

23:37.154 --> 23:38.852
stretching it
and wrapping it.

23:38.982 --> 23:41.637
- There's a work around,
a leather-wrapped tang.

23:41.768 --> 23:43.683
- Because that is genius.

23:43.813 --> 23:45.380
- That's what he did,
right there.

23:45.511 --> 23:46.599
- I love it.

23:46.729 --> 23:48.557
- Get an edge
on this real fast.

23:48.688 --> 23:50.298
I got five minutes
for the glue to set up,

23:50.429 --> 23:52.300
so I start getting
on the grinder

23:52.431 --> 23:54.911
to put an edge
on this thing.

23:55.042 --> 23:57.914
- Did Mike put any medallions
on his handle yet?

23:58.045 --> 24:00.439
- I don't know.

24:00.569 --> 24:01.701
- I need to attach
my medallions.

24:01.831 --> 24:03.354
Agh!

24:03.485 --> 24:06.140
I can do this with
a larger piece of brass

24:06.270 --> 24:08.751
that I used for the pommel.

24:08.882 --> 24:11.580
As I try and cut it,
it doesn't work out.

24:11.711 --> 24:14.061
I have to scrap the idea
and do something else.

24:14.191 --> 24:15.497
Let's do it.

24:15.628 --> 24:17.891
I don't have time to make it
a perfect replica.

24:18.021 --> 24:19.893
I'm doing what I have to
to make it a functional knife

24:20.023 --> 24:21.721
that represents what they want.

24:23.418 --> 24:25.681
I find some really
big pin stock.

24:25.812 --> 24:28.379
It'll be a smaller medallion.

24:28.510 --> 24:30.686
- The normal construction
with the medallion,

24:30.817 --> 24:32.558
sliding it over...
- Okay.

24:32.688 --> 24:35.386
- So there's a round medallion
in the middle, just like this.

24:35.517 --> 24:38.433
- Okay.
- Or you can do a two-piece

24:38.564 --> 24:40.522
construction like this,
sandwich it.

24:40.653 --> 24:43.612
As long as visually
that medallion exists

24:43.743 --> 24:45.266
as the palm slot.
- Yeah.

24:45.396 --> 24:47.921
- It's just a matter
of sizing that properly.

24:49.575 --> 24:52.708
- Five minutes bladesmiths!

24:52.839 --> 24:55.581
Alex set himself back
with this crappy weld

24:55.711 --> 24:57.278
that he dipped into water.

24:57.408 --> 25:00.063
His tang snapped off,
he's had to re-weld it back on.

25:00.194 --> 25:02.022
Now he's scrambling

25:02.152 --> 25:04.546
and you can see that
he's a little bit flustered.

25:04.677 --> 25:06.766
- I don't even know
what to focus on.

25:06.896 --> 25:08.985
I've got to get
this handle shaped down

25:09.116 --> 25:11.597
to at least
something you can hold,

25:11.727 --> 25:13.381
and I haven't even touched
my blade yet.

25:13.512 --> 25:15.296
I have to cut a few corners

25:15.426 --> 25:17.385
and do as much
as I possibly can

25:17.516 --> 25:18.560
to try and finish
this blade.

25:18.691 --> 25:21.607
- Five, four, three,

25:21.737 --> 25:23.870
two, one.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.133
Bladesmiths, shut down
your machines, drop your tools.

25:26.263 --> 25:28.614
This second round
of competition is over.

25:31.660 --> 25:34.707
- Uh, I'm not feeling
super great.

25:34.837 --> 25:36.839
I barely have an edge
on my knife

25:36.970 --> 25:39.363
and my handle
is still super rough,

25:39.494 --> 25:41.583
and that was one of
the craziest challenges

25:41.714 --> 25:43.106
I've ever had in knife making.

25:45.587 --> 25:47.328
- Bladesmiths, welcome
to the strength test.

25:47.458 --> 25:49.896
The old shield stab and chop.

25:50.026 --> 25:51.550
To test the strength
and durability of your edges

25:51.680 --> 25:53.334
and points on your pugios,

25:53.464 --> 25:55.423
as well as their overall
construction,

25:55.554 --> 25:58.905
I'll be chopping and stabbing
mercilessly into these shields.

25:59.035 --> 26:00.907
I don't really care what
happens to the shields in this.

26:01.037 --> 26:03.866
I want to see what happens
to your tip and edges.

26:03.997 --> 26:05.346
Alex, you're up first.
You ready?

26:05.476 --> 26:07.087
- Let's do it.
- All right.

26:09.437 --> 26:12.179
- I'm super nervous
going into testing.

26:12.309 --> 26:14.573
I'm not sure how my tang
is going to hold up

26:14.703 --> 26:16.009
after I just re-welded it.

26:16.139 --> 26:17.837
My tip is thin,

26:17.967 --> 26:20.709
so I'm just really hoping
that it can hold up.

26:56.876 --> 26:59.966
- Well, Alex,
first things first,

27:00.096 --> 27:02.664
you lost about a quarter inch
of your tip here.

27:02.795 --> 27:04.231
I'm looking
at the grain in there,

27:04.361 --> 27:06.973
and it's not as fine
as I'd like to see.

27:07.103 --> 27:08.539
It's probably
the overheating

27:08.670 --> 27:10.716
during the normalizations
or quenches.

27:10.846 --> 27:13.980
That aside, you left
some sharp corners

27:14.110 --> 27:16.417
of the wood right here, where
the wood contacts the brass,

27:16.547 --> 27:17.810
and it took a little,

27:17.940 --> 27:20.639
a little nibble
out of my thumb right here.

27:20.769 --> 27:24.077
But, in total, it's got
a good classic pugio shape

27:24.207 --> 27:27.733
and your edge
help up really well.

27:27.863 --> 27:29.430
Kevin?

27:29.560 --> 27:32.781
- Let's rock it man.
- All right, let's do it.

27:35.044 --> 27:38.091
- I'm a little anxious to see
how my knife is gonna perform.

27:38.221 --> 27:39.875
One of two things
are gonna happen.

27:40.006 --> 27:41.224
Either that shield's
gonna give,

27:41.355 --> 27:44.010
or my blade's gonna snap.

28:07.860 --> 28:09.078
- All right, Kevin.

28:09.209 --> 28:11.733
First things first,
the tip came off.

28:11.864 --> 28:14.344
Again, this grain
is bigger than I like.

28:14.475 --> 28:16.564
You also lost a piece
of your edge right here.

28:16.695 --> 28:18.261
There's a nibble out of it.

28:18.392 --> 28:20.263
We can go to your handle
construction here.

28:20.394 --> 28:23.005
- Don't call my baby ugly.
- No, sir.

28:23.136 --> 28:25.138
Look, you were under
a time crunch.

28:25.268 --> 28:27.967
You chose a method
of completing the challenge

28:28.097 --> 28:30.578
in a way that's
usable and wieldable.

28:30.709 --> 28:32.754
Well done.
- I'm down with it.

28:32.885 --> 28:34.582
- Mike, you're up next.
What are you thinking?

28:34.713 --> 28:36.889
- Let's do it.
- All right.

28:39.065 --> 28:41.067
- I haven't been nervous
until right now,

28:41.197 --> 28:42.808
and I'm going crazy.

28:42.938 --> 28:44.026
My competitors
both lost their tips.

28:44.157 --> 28:45.506
If I can keep my tip on,

28:45.636 --> 28:46.768
I don't think I'm going
to have any problems.

28:46.899 --> 28:47.987
But this is out
of my control.

28:48.117 --> 28:49.466
This is in the judge's hands.

29:07.136 --> 29:09.791
- Mike, your blade
doesn't have medallions

29:09.922 --> 29:11.750
on either side
of that handle,

29:11.880 --> 29:14.883
and it is a critical feature
in a pugio.

29:15.014 --> 29:17.277
And therefore,
your blade cannot be tested

29:17.407 --> 29:19.453
or measured evenly and fairly
with your competitors,

29:19.583 --> 29:21.020
and it doesn't make the cut.

29:21.150 --> 29:22.891
You did a lot of hard work
here, my friend,

29:23.022 --> 29:25.285
and it's an unfortunate
circumstance.

29:25.415 --> 29:27.461
But at this time,
I have to ask you

29:27.591 --> 29:28.854
to please leave The Forge.

29:28.984 --> 29:32.248
- Good job, guys.
Good job, guys.

29:32.379 --> 29:33.728
- If you're going to come
to this competition,

29:33.859 --> 29:35.817
make sure you pay attention
to the parameters.

29:35.948 --> 29:37.688
It's very important.

29:37.819 --> 29:41.040
The smalalst little detail
that you miss can get you off.

29:41.170 --> 29:42.955
This was
an amazing experience.

29:43.085 --> 29:45.740
I truly believe that
if I had my weapon tested,

29:45.871 --> 29:47.742
I would have went through
to the finals.

29:47.873 --> 29:49.178
What's next for me
is go home,

29:49.309 --> 29:50.789
and I'll probably make
another pugio,

29:50.919 --> 29:52.573
and I'm gonna send a picture
to the judges and say,

29:52.703 --> 29:54.401
"This is what I made."

29:58.100 --> 29:59.449
- Alex, Kevin, congratulations.

29:59.580 --> 30:00.842
You guys are in the third

30:00.973 --> 30:02.713
and final round
of this competition,

30:02.844 --> 30:04.977
which means that you're both
one step closer to the title

30:05.107 --> 30:07.457
of "Forged in Fire" champion
and a check for $10,000.

30:07.588 --> 30:09.982
All you need to do now
is go home and re-create

30:10.112 --> 30:12.593
this iconic weapon
from history.

30:15.683 --> 30:17.250
The spatha.

30:19.905 --> 30:21.471
The spatha
was a vicious sword

30:21.602 --> 30:23.822
given to infantry during
the Roman Empire.

30:23.952 --> 30:25.693
The double-edged weapon
was used to inflict

30:25.824 --> 30:27.738
deep slashes and deadly cuts
on their enemies

30:27.869 --> 30:29.653
while the tapered tip
was effective for thrusting.

30:29.784 --> 30:31.307
In the third
and fourth centuries,

30:31.438 --> 30:32.874
some of these
Roman soldiers turned sides

30:33.005 --> 30:34.397
and became Barbarians.

30:34.528 --> 30:35.746
They then used the spatha

30:35.877 --> 30:37.444
in wars against
the Roman Empire,

30:37.574 --> 30:39.141
and eventually led
to its demise.

30:39.272 --> 30:41.187
Ancient Rome continues
to be the backdrop

30:41.317 --> 30:43.319
for blockbuster films
like "Gladiator,"

30:43.450 --> 30:47.367
in which the spatha
can be seen wielded in battle.

30:47.497 --> 30:50.370
Gentlemen, your final challenge
is to forge a spatha.

30:50.500 --> 30:53.852
Your blades must be between
27 and 29 inches in length.

30:53.982 --> 30:56.419
They must have a medial ridge
on both sides of the blade,

30:56.550 --> 30:58.204
and it must be double edged.

30:58.334 --> 31:00.641
It must have a wooden guard,
and a disk pommel.

31:00.771 --> 31:02.773
You'll have just four days
at your home forges

31:02.904 --> 31:04.514
in which to complete
this weapon.

31:04.645 --> 31:07.300
After your judges have
thoroughly tested your blades,

31:07.430 --> 31:09.693
they'll declare one of you
the "Forged in Fire" champion

31:09.824 --> 31:13.915
who walks out of here with
that check for $10,000.

31:14.046 --> 31:16.483
Good luck, bladesmiths.
We'll see you in four days.

31:16.613 --> 31:19.007
- Good luck.
- Kevin.

31:23.838 --> 31:26.232
- So, it's day one
in Belleville, West Virginia.

31:26.362 --> 31:28.277
I got a spatha to go make.
Let's get crackalackin.

31:28.408 --> 31:30.366
Whoo!

31:30.497 --> 31:32.455
I'm gonna be using 5160.

31:32.586 --> 31:34.109
It's a forgiving medium.

31:34.240 --> 31:35.850
It'll bring some strength
to whatever

31:35.981 --> 31:39.027
they're gonna
smash, cut, break, kill.

31:39.158 --> 31:42.030
So I'm gonna try big sexy
first to bash down

31:42.161 --> 31:44.467
the width of that material
to about two-and-a-half

31:44.598 --> 31:46.078
to two-and-a-quarter
inches wide.

31:49.690 --> 31:51.648
Come on, dang it.
Work!

31:54.086 --> 31:56.827
Four days isn't enough time
to make a spatha.

31:56.958 --> 31:59.961
You don't know what the
complications are going to be.

32:00.092 --> 32:01.789
Oh, she's getting
there though.

32:01.920 --> 32:03.660
I slowly started
drawing it out.

32:03.791 --> 32:05.488
I'm about 35 inches long.

32:05.619 --> 32:06.837
You know,
it's just patience,

32:06.968 --> 32:08.578
getting the equipment
to work right.

32:08.709 --> 32:10.276
Tomorrow,
the pressure will be on

32:10.406 --> 32:12.582
because I gotta get
this thing quenched.

32:12.713 --> 32:14.367
If I don't,
I'm behind the ball.

32:14.497 --> 32:17.196
Whoo!

32:19.198 --> 32:20.808
- Definitely excited
to be back home,

32:20.939 --> 32:23.506
back in my shop where
I'm nice and comfortable.

32:23.637 --> 32:27.075
I'm gonna do a full
Damascus blade

32:27.206 --> 32:29.469
with a little bit
of a ladder pattern in it.

32:29.599 --> 32:32.211
I'm really looking forward
to going all out

32:32.341 --> 32:35.431
and making something really
cool to impress the judges.

32:35.562 --> 32:38.217
First press was just nice
and quick and light.

32:38.347 --> 32:39.783
Just push everything together.

32:39.914 --> 32:42.786
This next press will be
a little more aggressive.

32:42.917 --> 32:46.616
Probably the most important
part of this entire build.

32:46.747 --> 32:48.705
My welds seemed
to have stuck pretty well.

32:48.836 --> 32:51.056
I'm going to start
drawing this thing out.

32:55.016 --> 32:57.192
I've got one seam
that came apart.

32:57.323 --> 33:00.195
I think if I just flux it,
get it hot and press it again,

33:00.326 --> 33:01.544
it should be okay.

33:01.675 --> 33:03.677
Let's hope.

33:03.807 --> 33:06.897
This might be a make-or-break
moment right here.

33:07.028 --> 33:08.987
I really hope
that's the only one,

33:09.117 --> 33:11.337
but deep down
I'm petrified that there's

33:11.467 --> 33:12.816
gonna be more of these seams

33:12.947 --> 33:15.428
opening up throughout
this billet.

33:17.082 --> 33:20.302
Right there,
I can see it's coming apart.

33:22.087 --> 33:23.914
Trying to figure out
what I'm gonna do.

33:27.962 --> 33:30.138
So I think my best bet

33:30.269 --> 33:32.097
is gonna be to break
this billet in half

33:32.227 --> 33:36.362
and salvage as much welded
steel as I possibly can,

33:36.492 --> 33:40.931
and I'll just do a generic
random pattern Damascus,

33:41.062 --> 33:44.457
but it'll still be
a Damascus sword.

33:44.587 --> 33:47.286
Well, the good news is both
of those seem really solid.

33:47.416 --> 33:49.810
So at least got something
out of today.

33:52.160 --> 33:54.249
- Today, I need to get
the blade done and quenched.

33:54.380 --> 33:57.035
So I got the shoulders put in.

33:57.165 --> 33:59.472
I have the medial ridge
where you can distinctly see

33:59.602 --> 34:01.735
where it's starting
to come together.

34:01.865 --> 34:06.479
It's time for the quench.

34:06.609 --> 34:08.307
Oh .

34:11.092 --> 34:13.964
Yeah, look at that
bend.

34:14.095 --> 34:16.141
We're quenching again
'cause I don't have time

34:16.271 --> 34:18.665
to eff around
with a normalization,

34:18.795 --> 34:20.406
'cause I went all the way
down to the bottom

34:20.536 --> 34:22.190
and I felt it bend.

34:22.321 --> 34:25.367
I got to go through
all the steps all over again.

34:29.589 --> 34:31.591
Still got that bend.

34:31.721 --> 34:34.507
I'm going to temper overnight,
and in that process,

34:34.637 --> 34:37.901
it'll start to hopefully
normalize down.

34:38.032 --> 34:38.989
It's hit or miss.

34:39.120 --> 34:40.252
It's either going to go well,

34:40.382 --> 34:41.688
or it's gonna go wrong,

34:41.818 --> 34:44.473
and yeah,
it went wrong today.

34:46.606 --> 34:48.216
- It's the morning
of day two.

34:48.347 --> 34:50.088
I definitely had
some setbacks yesterday.

34:50.218 --> 34:52.090
Starting the day
with my billet tacked up

34:52.220 --> 34:53.917
and ready for forge welding.

34:54.048 --> 34:55.180
And I'm hoping
to end the day

34:55.310 --> 34:57.225
with a quenched
and hardened spatha.

34:57.356 --> 34:59.184
First press.

35:02.274 --> 35:06.452
Looks okay so far, but I'm
still gonna be really careful.

35:06.582 --> 35:10.195
I've got my billet drawn out
pretty close to shape.

35:10.325 --> 35:12.371
I have just enough length here,

35:12.501 --> 35:14.721
and you can see
I'm kind of forging in

35:14.851 --> 35:16.940
that medial ridge already.

35:17.071 --> 35:18.942
This is the longest blade

35:19.073 --> 35:20.727
I have ever
attempted to quench.

35:22.816 --> 35:24.774
I pull the blade
out of the oil.

35:24.905 --> 35:26.036
At the end of the day,

35:26.167 --> 35:27.647
I have an intact
Damascus blade.

35:27.777 --> 35:29.431
So first thing tomorrow,
I'm gonna get my blade etched

35:29.562 --> 35:31.433
and the handle prepared,

35:31.564 --> 35:33.522
and I'm looking forward
to a good day.

35:35.524 --> 35:37.657
- I'm feeling better
than last night

35:37.787 --> 35:39.006
because I got
the blade tempered

35:39.137 --> 35:40.355
and got it straight.

35:40.486 --> 35:41.965
Still behind the ball.

35:42.096 --> 35:44.664
I'm gonna start
to fit up the handle.

35:44.794 --> 35:46.361
Start looking
at different parts

35:46.492 --> 35:48.146
and what I think looks well.

35:48.276 --> 35:50.452
So my design plan
for this pommel

35:50.583 --> 35:52.628
is I'm going to take the two
ends of the deer antlers

35:52.759 --> 35:55.588
and I'm going to carve
a lion's head out of them.

35:55.718 --> 35:58.591
Hand-carving anything
is time consuming,

35:58.721 --> 36:00.810
so I can't get lost
in my head.

36:00.941 --> 36:03.465
I'll set it in on top
of glow-in-the-dark resin,

36:03.596 --> 36:05.641
and then I'll fill that in
with a clear epoxy.

36:05.772 --> 36:07.948
I'm not walking in there
with something plain.

36:08.078 --> 36:09.558
Tomorrow I'm going to put

36:09.689 --> 36:11.430
some bronze metal stain
on the blade,

36:11.560 --> 36:12.953
and I'm going to finish this
no matter what.

36:13.083 --> 36:14.737
It'll be done.

36:16.174 --> 36:17.305
- I started day four.

36:17.436 --> 36:18.611
The fatigue of the past
couple of days

36:18.741 --> 36:20.178
is definitely
starting to set in.

36:20.308 --> 36:22.136
The blades been etched
in the coffee overnight

36:22.267 --> 36:24.138
to really bring out
the contrast.

36:24.269 --> 36:27.315
Yeah, it really darkened up
that 1084.

36:27.446 --> 36:30.013
So the spatha needs
to have a wooden guard

36:30.144 --> 36:31.798
and a disk-shaped pommel.

36:31.928 --> 36:34.279
So, I'm going to do
a stacked handle.

36:34.409 --> 36:36.672
I'm using iron wood
for the guard and the pommel

36:36.803 --> 36:38.413
because it's super strong,

36:38.544 --> 36:39.806
and then I'm gonna use
black wood

36:39.936 --> 36:41.677
for the main part
of the handle.

36:41.808 --> 36:44.419
I've got all my individual
pieces of this handle

36:44.550 --> 36:46.639
fitted up nice and tight.

36:46.769 --> 36:48.380
I gotta get this
blade sharpened,

36:48.510 --> 36:50.208
and I've never sharpened
anything this long before.

36:50.338 --> 36:52.384
But I know how to put
an edge on a knife.

36:52.514 --> 36:54.777
I cannot wait to see
this thing put to the test.

37:00.043 --> 37:01.001
Word.

37:06.354 --> 37:08.269
- Bladesmiths,
welcome back to The Forge.

37:08.400 --> 37:10.489
You fellas have had
four days at your home forges

37:10.619 --> 37:12.752
to work on your finale spathas.

37:12.882 --> 37:14.667
Alex, how did it go?

37:14.797 --> 37:17.104
- I definitely managed to find
my fair share of challenges,

37:17.235 --> 37:18.497
but it went pretty well.

37:20.412 --> 37:22.544
My blade is about a 50-layer

37:22.675 --> 37:25.765
Damascus steel out
of SK5 and 15N20,

37:25.895 --> 37:29.203
with a wrought iron guard
and pommel inset,

37:29.334 --> 37:31.249
and I've got iron wood
guard and pommel

37:31.379 --> 37:33.251
with a black wood handle.

37:33.381 --> 37:35.862
- Kevin, tell us a little bit
about your blade.

37:35.992 --> 37:38.081
- I made a blade out of 5160,

37:38.212 --> 37:39.866
and I made a pommel

37:39.996 --> 37:41.955
out of brass
sandwiched with rosewood,

37:42.085 --> 37:45.088
and then I used tagua nuts
to make it look like ivory,

37:45.219 --> 37:48.135
and then bronze stained
the sword itself.

37:48.266 --> 37:50.050
- Nice, that's why it's got
that red appearance.

37:50.180 --> 37:51.747
- It does.

37:51.878 --> 37:53.358
- All right, to determine
which one of you

37:53.488 --> 37:54.663
is our next
"Forged in Fire" champion,

37:54.794 --> 37:57.100
we will put your blades
through three tests.

37:57.231 --> 37:58.537
There will be a strength test,
a sharpness test,

37:58.667 --> 38:00.452
and up first,
the KEAL test.

38:00.582 --> 38:02.236
Doug.

38:05.239 --> 38:06.414
- All right, bladesmiths,

38:06.545 --> 38:08.764
your spatha swords
look amazing.

38:08.895 --> 38:11.506
It's time to find out what kind
of lethal damage they can do.

38:11.637 --> 38:13.378
To do that,
I will take your weapon,

38:13.508 --> 38:15.423
deliver some killing
slashes and blows

38:15.554 --> 38:18.905
on this more than willing
ballistics dummy.

38:19.035 --> 38:20.341
Alex, you're up first.
You ready for this?

38:20.472 --> 38:23.344
- Let's do it.
- Let's do it.

38:23.475 --> 38:25.259
- As soon as I finished
this blade,

38:25.390 --> 38:27.392
I was content knowing
whatever's gonna happen

38:27.522 --> 38:30.046
is gonna happen, but now that I'm here,

38:30.177 --> 38:32.353
standing in front of the dummy
and Doug's got my sword,

38:32.484 --> 38:33.354
I'm starting to get
a little jittery.

38:36.096 --> 38:38.577
Yeah, I'm a little nervous
to see what this blade does.

39:13.829 --> 39:16.266
- All right, Alex, first up,

39:16.397 --> 39:18.094
I can really
appreciate the beauty

39:18.225 --> 39:20.009
that you have with your
Damascus pattern right there.

39:20.140 --> 39:21.881
It's really stands out.

39:22.011 --> 39:24.187
Very clean lines.

39:24.318 --> 39:26.842
The medial ridge you have
on here, I can imagine,

39:26.973 --> 39:28.714
well, how much work
that takes to get it

39:28.844 --> 39:32.674
almost perfectly straight
all the way through to the tip.

39:32.805 --> 39:35.634
Your tip is sharp enough
to penetrate with a thrust

39:35.764 --> 39:37.375
and lacerate on the way out.

39:37.505 --> 39:39.377
And most importantly,

39:39.507 --> 39:40.726
it will KEAL.

39:40.856 --> 39:42.858
- Thank you.
- Good job.

39:42.989 --> 39:44.382
All right, Kevin, it's your
turn. So you ready?

39:44.512 --> 39:47.646
- Hell yeah.
- Let's do this.

39:47.776 --> 39:51.084
- Alex's spatha just destroyed
that ballistics dummy.

39:51.214 --> 39:54.304
And now I'm feeling
anxious, excited.

39:54.435 --> 39:56.698
I got the adrenaline going.

40:07.013 --> 40:08.667
- It doesn't have a ridge.
- Through to the tip.

40:11.191 --> 40:12.975
No medial ridge on
either side of the blade.

40:13.106 --> 40:15.325
It's one of the parameters.
- Right.

40:20.548 --> 40:23.377
Kevin, your blade must
fall within our parameters

40:23.508 --> 40:25.945
in order to be tested
evenly and fairly

40:26.075 --> 40:27.512
with your competitors.

40:27.642 --> 40:30.166
Your blade does not have
a central ridge.

40:30.297 --> 40:31.994
That was a parameter
that was outlined

40:32.125 --> 40:33.387
before we ever
sent you home.

40:33.518 --> 40:34.867
And for that reason,

40:34.997 --> 40:37.043
you cannot be
the "Forged in Fire" champion.

40:37.173 --> 40:38.827
Come on, my friend.

40:38.958 --> 40:41.482
- You know, it's just a bummer
I can't see it tested.

40:41.613 --> 40:44.354
That's what I really wanted.
I want to see how it holds up.

40:44.485 --> 40:45.617
- Nice work on that handle,
though.

40:45.747 --> 40:47.270
- Thank you,
I appreciate it.

40:47.401 --> 40:50.752
When I was making it,
it had the defined ridge in it.

40:50.883 --> 40:52.798
Just with the sanding
and grinding,

40:52.928 --> 40:54.408
it just took more of it off.

40:54.539 --> 40:56.366
But this whole experience
has been a blast.

40:56.497 --> 40:57.933
Congratulations.

40:58.064 --> 40:59.457
This isn't a loss.

40:59.587 --> 41:02.024
I'm coming home with
a $10,000 experience.

41:04.070 --> 41:07.508
- Alex, you made a sharp
and deadly spatha.

41:07.639 --> 41:09.205
But not only that,
you made something

41:09.336 --> 41:11.860
that is detailed and beautiful.

41:11.991 --> 41:14.994
Your attention to detail
has elevated you

41:15.124 --> 41:17.257
to the title of
"Forged in Fire" champion.

41:17.387 --> 41:18.737
Congratulations.

41:18.867 --> 41:21.783
Your title comes with
a check for $10,000.

41:21.914 --> 41:23.176
Good job, brother.

41:23.306 --> 41:24.569
- This is pretty wild.

41:24.699 --> 41:26.484
I came here
to challenge myself

41:26.614 --> 41:28.747
and put myself through
a super rigorous test

41:28.877 --> 41:30.618
and I came out on top,
and it feels great.

41:30.749 --> 41:32.707
This $10,000,

41:32.838 --> 41:35.405
I'm actually gonna give it
all straight to my parents.

41:35.536 --> 41:37.407
They supported me
through college

41:37.538 --> 41:38.887
as I was learning
bladesmithing

41:39.018 --> 41:40.498
and they're both
getting ready to retire.

41:40.628 --> 41:42.804
So it's all going to them.
