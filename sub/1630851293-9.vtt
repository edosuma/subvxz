00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
WELCOME TO THE SHOW.

00:31.000 --> 00:31.000
STILL TAKING PLACE

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
IN THIS BLANK VOID.

00:33.000 --> 00:34.000
I'VE NICKNAMED IT

00:34.000 --> 00:35.000
"PRINCE PHILLIP'S COFFIN"

00:35.000 --> 00:36.000
BECAUSE IT'S A SAD LITTLE BOX

00:36.000 --> 00:37.000
CONTAINING A RAPIDLY DECOMPOSING

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
BRITISH MAN.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.000
AND LOOK, IN THE WAKE OF

00:40.000 --> 00:41.000
THE SHOOTING OF DAUNTE WRIGHT

00:42.000 --> 00:43.000
LAST SUNDAY, I CAN SAFELY SAY:

00:43.000 --> 00:43.000
THIS WEEK HAS BEEN A FUCKING

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
NIGHTMARE.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
FROM THE NEWS HE WAS PULLED OVER

00:47.000 --> 00:48.000
FOR MINOR TRAFFIC VIOLATIONS,

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
INCLUDING HAVING AN

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
AIR FRESHENER HANGING

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
ON HIS REAR VIEW MIRROR,

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
TO THE 26-YEAR-VETERAN OF

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
THE POLICE FORCE WHO KILLED HIM

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
CLAIMING IT WAS SOMEHOW AN

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
ACCIDENT, TO THE LOCAL POLICE

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
DEPARTMENT FLYING A THIN BLUE

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
LINE FLAG AFTER THE SHOOTING.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
WHICH IS JUST CORN-FED,

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
DEEP FRIED BULLSHIT.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
THE WEEK SANK INTO A

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
DEPRESSINGLY FAMILIAR CYCLE,

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
WITH THE PRESIDENT INSISTING ON

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
"PEACEFUL PROTEST" -- WHICH IS

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
SO OFTEN JUST ANOTHER WAY TO

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
PRIORITIZE COMPLIANCE OVER

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
RIGHTEOUS DISSENT,

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
AND TO PROTECT PROPERTY OVER

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
HUMAN LIVES.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
AND THOSE KIND OF CALLS WERE

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
ESPECIALLY GALLING, GIVEN

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
LAW ENFORCEMENT'S

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
ANYTHING-BUT-PEACEFUL RESPONSE,

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
AS POLICE FIRED TEAR GAS,

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
RUBBER BULLETS, AND FLASH BANG

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
GRENADES AT PROTESTORS,

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
CREATING MORE TENSION AND

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
ANXIETY IN AN ALREADY

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
EMOTIONALLY EXHAUSTED CITY.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
AND LOOK, WE COULD KEEP UP OUR

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
PART IN THAT CYCLE.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
RIGHT NOW, I COULD CITE

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
STATISTICS ABOUT POLICE USING

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
EXCESSIVE FORCE.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
I COULD DUNK ON ALL THE

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
APPALLING RESPONSES FROM

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
CONSERVATIVE MEDIA FIGURES.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
I COULD REITERATE, YET AGAIN,

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
THAT WHAT HAPPENED IS COMPLETELY

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
WRONG, BUT THE FACT IS,

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
WE COULDN'T EVEN FINISH WRITING

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
DAUNTE WRIGHT BEFORE

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
THE CITY OF CHICAGO RELEASED

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
VIDEO OF ONE OF THEIR OFFICERS

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
KILLING A 13-YEAR-OLD UNARMED

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
CHILD, ADAM TOLEDO -- FOOTAGE

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
WHICH CLEARLY CONTRADICTED

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
THE PICTURE OF AN

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
"ARMED CONFRONTATION" PAINTED BY

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
THE POLICE AND THE MAYOR,

02:01.000 --> 02:07.000
AS WELL AS A PROSECUTOR WHO'D

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
SAID TOLEDO HAD A GUN IN HIS

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
HAND WHEN HE WAS SHOT.

02:10.000 --> 02:10.000
WHICH HE DID NOT.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
AND THAT REVELATION BEGAN

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
THE CYCLE OF PROTESTS,

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
CALLS FOR PEACE, AND POLICE

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
OVERREACTION ALL OVER AGAIN.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
AND HERE IS THE THING.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
THIS SHOW HAS BEEN ON THE AIR

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
FOR SEVEN YEARS NOW.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
WHICH, I KNOW, SOME MIGHT ARGUE

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
IS EIGHT YEARS TOO MANY.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
AND IN THAT TIME, WE HAVE

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
REPEATEDLY COVERED

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
THE MULTIPLE WAYS POLICE

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
TERRORIZE COMMUNITIES OF COLOR

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
IN THIS COUNTRY.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
WE'VE DONE STORIES ON POLICE

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
MILITARIZATION, ON THEIR OVERUSE

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
OF MUNICIPAL VIOLATIONS

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
AND RAIDS, ON THEIR LACK OF

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
ACCOUNTABILITY, AND ON HOW

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
THE HISTORY OF POLICING IN

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
AMERICA IS INEXTRICABLY LINKED

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
WITH WHITE SUPREMACY.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
AND I COULD MAKE THE SAME

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
ARGUMENTS TO YOU AGAIN NOW.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
I COULD DESCRIBE THE PROBLEM TO

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
YOU, BUT I THINK YOU KNOW WHAT

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
-- AND WHO -- IT IS.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
I CAN OFFER SOLUTIONS, BUT I

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
THINK YOU KNOW WHAT THEY ARE.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
I CAN OFFER ANGER, BUT IF YOU'RE

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
A SENTIENT HUMAN BEING ALIVE

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
RIGHT NOW AND YOU'RE NOT ALREADY

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
FULL OF THAT, I HONESTLY DON'T

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
KNOW WHAT TO SAY TO YOU.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
BECAUSE THE FACT IS,

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
BLACK PEOPLE CONTINUE TO BE

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
MOWED DOWN BY THE POLICE THAT

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
THEY PAY FOR.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
AND IF YOU'VE WATCHED THE NEWS

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
AT ALL THIS WEEK, YOU'RE

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
PROBABLY EXHAUSTED.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
BLACK PEOPLE IN AMERICA

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
DEFINITELY ARE.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
NOT JUST FROM THIS WEEK,

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
BUT ALSO FROM THE, Y'KNOW,

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
EVERYTHING.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
THE BLACK WRITERS ON THIS STAFF

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
SET UP AN OUT OF OFFICE REPLY

03:16.000 --> 03:21.000
THAT JUST SAYS, "NAH."

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
AND HONESTLY, I KIND OF GET IT.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
SO GIVEN ALL THAT, WE THOUGHT

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
TONIGHT WE'D TRY AND BREAK OUR

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
PART IN THIS CYCLE AND INSTEAD

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
ATTEMPT TO DO SOMETHING

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
BECAUSE WE'VE DECIDED TO GIVE

03:30.000 --> 03:30.000
ANYONE WHO NEEDS IT A CHANCE TO

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
REGROUP.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
AND THE NEXT SEVEN MINUTES ARE

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
FOR ANYONE WHO'S FELT CRUSHED

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
BY THIS WEEK.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
IF YOU CAN'T WATCH THOSE CLIPS

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
AGAIN, WE'RE NOT GOING TO SHOW

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
THEM TO YOU.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
INSTEAD, WE'RE GOING TO

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
HOPEFULLY PROVIDE SOME TINY

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
PIECES OF STUPID, SILLY JOY

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
BEFORE WE ALL PLUNGE BACK INTO

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
THE FIGHT.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
AND SO THAT IS WHY OUR FIRST

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
STORY TONIGHT CONCERNS A GIANT

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
BUNNY.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
SPECIFICALLY, ONE THAT'S GONE

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
MISSING.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
AND IF YOU'RE THINKING, "YOU'RE

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
NOT SERIOUSLY GOING TO TALK

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
ABOUT A GIANT BUNNY RIGHT NOW,"

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
-- WELL, YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE

03:59.000 --> 04:03.000
BUNNY YET.

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
>> POLICE ARE SEARCHING FOR A

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
GUINNESS WORLD RECORD HOLDING RABBIT.

04:07.000 --> 04:07.000
>> DARIUS, THE RABBIT RECORD

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
BREAKER, LAST SEEN IN HIS

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
HUTCH-CUM-SHED, LAST SATURDAY.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
AS THE WORLD'S LONGEST BUNNY HIS

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
OWNER IS DESPERATE TO FIND HIM.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
ANNETTE EDWARDS TWEETED, "A VERY

04:17.000 --> 04:17.000
SAD DAY.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
THERE IS A REWARD OF 1,000

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
POUNDS.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
DARIUS IS TOO OLD TO BREED NOW.

04:22.000 --> 04:26.000
SO PLEASE BRING HIM BACK."

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
>> John: YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT,

04:27.000 --> 04:27.000
AMERICA:

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
BIG RABBIT GOT TAKEN LIKE IN

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
"TAKEN."

04:29.000 --> 04:33.000
LOOK AT THAT LONG LAD!

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
AND BY THE WAY, AN APPEAL TO

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
THE RABBIT SNATCHERS WITH

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
"BRING HIM BACK, HE'S OLD,

04:36.000 --> 04:36.000
HE'S SHOOTING BLANKS.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
HE'S USELESS"?

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
QUIT PUTTING DARIUS' BUSINESS

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
OUT THERE IN THE STREETS.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
EVEN IN MIDDLE AGE, DARIUS IS

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
A HOTROD WHOSE GOT YEARS OF

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
BURROWING AND BANGING LEFT.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
GIVE HIM THE RESPECT

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
HE DESERVES.

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
AND THE FACT THIS BUNNY BEHEMOTH

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
IS MISSING REALLY SOURS THIS

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
CLIP OF DARIUS AND HIS OWNER

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
FROM HAPPIER TIMES.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
>> HE'S NOW BRINGING OUT

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
CHILDREN'S BOOKS, HE'S DOING

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
A CALENDAR, HE'S DOING

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
A WORLD TOUR.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
THERE'S NO STOPPING DARIUS!

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
>> John: WELL, IT TURNS OUT

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
THERE WAS ONE WAY TO STOP

05:06.000 --> 05:06.000
DARIUS!

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
AND THAT'S STRAIGHT SNATCHING UP

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
ALL 51 EXTREMELY WEIRD INCHES OF

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
HIM.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
I GUESS PRIDE GOETH BEFORE

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
THE FALL, AND AGGRESSIVE

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
COMMODIFICATION GOETH BEFORE

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
THE JUMBO JACKRABBIT JACKING.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
AND THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THIS

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
ABSOLUTE MONSTROSITY WAS NOT

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
THE ONLY BLISSFULLY STUPID STORY

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
THIS WEEK.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
FOR A FEW DAYS, THE INTERNET

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
LIT UP WITH THE CLAIM THAT

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
USHER TIPPED VEGAS STRIPPERS

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
IN USHER BUCKS WITH HIS FACE

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
ON THEM.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
WHICH, ON THE ONE HAND, IS

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
ICONIC, BUT, ON THE OTHER HAND,

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
IS FUCKING ICONIC.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
AND I WOULDN'T BLAME THE DANCERS

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
FOR BEING MAD ABOUT ENDING

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
THEIR NIGHT WITH A THONG FULL OF

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
USHER SELFIES.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
ALTHOUGH, I DO HAVE TO TELL YOU,

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
THE STRIP CLUB INSISTS USHER

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
DIDN'T USE FAKE MONEY TO TIP

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
THE DANCERS, ADDING,

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
"HE CONVERTED THOUSANDS OF

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
REAL DOLLARS TO TIP THEM" AND

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
"USHER WAS A TRUE GENTLEMAN."

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
BUT TO ME, THAT ACTUALLY MAKES

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
THIS STORY EVEN BETTER, BECAUSE

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
"USHER WAS A TRUE GENTLEMAN" IS

05:52.000 --> 05:52.000
NOW MY FAVORITE THING I'VE EVER

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
BEEN LEGALLY REQUIRED TO

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
CLARIFY.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
AND THEN THERE WAS THIS.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
>> WE'RE GETTING A LOOK AT WHAT

05:59.000 --> 05:59.000
SOME ATHLETES WILL WEAR AT

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
THE SUMMER OLYMPICS IN TOKYO.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
RALPH LAUREN UNVEILED THESE

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
UNIFORMS FOR TEAM USA.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
THIS ENSEMBLE WILL BE WORN

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
DURING THE CLOSING CEREMONY AND,

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
>> John: OKAY, I'M JUST GOING TO

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
SAY IT: THAT IS A TERRIBLE

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
OUTFIT.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
THEY LOOK LIKE THE CAST OF

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
A CBS SCI-FI DRAMA THAT NO ONE'S

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
EVER HEARD OF DESPITE BEING ON

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
THE AIR FOR 16 SEASONS.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
ALSO, WHY IS THE U.S. OLYMPIC

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
TEAM ALWAYS OUTFITTED BY

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
RALPH LAUREN, WHICH HAS BEEN

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
HANDLING IT SINCE 2008, AND HAS

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
CONSISTENTLY PRODUCED SHIT LIKE

06:24.000 --> 06:28.000
THIS, THIS, AND THIS -- AN

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000

STRAIGHT GARBAGE.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000

07:06.000 --> 07:12.000
EIGHT-YEAR-OLD GIRLS.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000

07:13.000 --> 07:13.000

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
ALTHOUGH I WILL SAY,

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
I'VE ALWAYS FELT IT'S WRONG THAT

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
"CANADIAN TUXEDO" REFERS TO

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
NAKED ON A VIRTUAL

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
QUITE WHY HE DID THAT IN FRONT

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
OF A CAMERA, I MEAN, WHO KNOWS.

07:56.000 --> 07:56.000
[LAUGHS]

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
>> John: NOW, OBVIOUSLY,

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
I FEEL TERRIBLE FOR THAT MAN.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
IT WAS CLEARLY A COMPLETE

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
ACCIDENT.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
ALTHOUGH I WILL SAY, HE'S GOT

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO BE

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
ASHAMED OF THERE.

08:07.000 --> 08:07.000
HE'S KEEPIN' TIGHT AND HE'S

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
KEEPIN' IT RIGHT.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
HE'S MAINTAINING WHILE THE REST

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000

08:10.000 --> 08:10.000

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
THAT IS HOT MALE BEHAVIOR.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
I HAVEN'T TAKEN A JOG

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
SINCE SEPTEMBER 11th.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
AND BY THE WAY, IF YOU THINK HE

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
LOOKS GOOD WITH HIS CLOTHES OFF,

08:20.000 --> 08:20.000
WAIT TIL YOU SEE HIM WITH

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
HEY, CANADA!

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
CHECK YOUR CARBON EMISSIONS,

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
BECAUSE THERE'S A MASSIVE SMOKE

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
AND I HAVE TO SAY, IT'S TRULY

DELIGHTFUL WATCHING A NEWS

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
IMPOLITE, EVEN IN THE FACE OF

09:19.000 --> 09:25.000

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
WITH GOOD GRACE, I HONESTLY

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
NEEDED THIS STORY THIS WEEK.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
WEIRD SHIT HAPPENED THIS WEEK!

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
AND WE WANTED TO GIVE YOU A

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
CHANCE TO LAUGH AT IT, TO GIVE

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
YOU JUST A BREATH AT THE END OF

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
A TRULY DEMORALIZING WEEK.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
SO IF YOU NEEDED A BREAK,

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
I REALLY HOPE THAT GAVE YOU ONE.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
AND IF YOU DIDN'T NEED A BREAK,

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
MAYBE ASK YOURSELF WHY THE FUCK

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
NOT, AND THINK ABOUT THAT

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
FOR A WHILE.

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
BECAUSE THE FACT IS, IT'S ONCE

AGAIN MADE PAINFULLY CLEAR THAT

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
WE -- AND WHEN I SAY "WE," I

CHANGE IN POLICING AND ACTUALLY

13:23.000 --> 13:23.000
CLIP FROM "SHARK TANK."

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
>> JEFF, I UNDERSTAND YOUR

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
DECISION TO GO BANKRUPT,

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
CLEANS THE SLATE, BUT IT CARRIES

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
A WEIGHT.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
YOU'LL NEVER HAVE A BANK,

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
JEFF.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
EVER.

13:30.000 --> 13:35.000
TO ME, YOU'RE RADIOACTIVE.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
>> THERE ARE A MILLION PEOPLE

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
OUT THERE WHO ARE GOING TO GET

13:38.000 --> 13:38.000
THE WRONG MESSAGE FROM WHAT

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
YOU'RE SAYING.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
>> NO, THEY'RE GETTING THE RIGHT

13:40.000 --> 13:40.000
MESSAGE.

13:40.000 --> 13:43.000
THEY SHOULD NOT GO BANKRUPT.

13:43.000 --> 13:47.000
>> John: WELL, HOLD ON.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
BECAUSE THAT IS A TERRIBLE

13:48.000 --> 13:48.000
LESSON.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
AND YOU, KEVIN O'LEARY, ARE

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
HARDLY ONE TO BE CALLING

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
SOMEONE'S DECISIONS

13:51.000 --> 13:54.000
"RADIOACTIVE," GIVEN YOU

13:54.000 --> 13:59.000
INVESTED IN COMPANIES WITH

13:59.000 --> 13:59.000
BUSINESS MODELS LIKE:

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
PUT YOUR FACE ON A POTATO,

14:01.000 --> 14:01.000
LOOK LIKE AN IDIOT

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
ON A UNICYCLE, AND TOYGAROO,

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
THE NETFLIX FOR TOYS, WHOSE

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
MASCOT ALWAYS LOOKED LIKE IT WAS

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
SEARCHING FOR A PLACE TO TAKE A

14:05.000 --> 14:05.000
SHIT.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
AND WHICH, INTERESTINGLY, FILED

14:07.000 --> 14:07.000
FOR FUCKING BANKRUPTCY.

14:07.000 --> 14:08.000
SO I'M SORRY, KEVIN, BUT TO ME,

14:09.000 --> 14:09.000
THAT MAKES YOU RADIOACTIVE.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
I'M OUT!

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
BUT THAT BROAD-BRUSH

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
STIGMATIZATION IS COMMON AND

14:12.000 --> 14:15.000
COMPLETELY MISGUIDED.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
BECAUSE BANKRUPTCY IS NOT SOLELY

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
CAUSED BY BAD DECISIONS, IT'S

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
OFTEN CAUSED BY BAD LUCK:

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
UNAVOIDABLE CHALLENGES

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
LIKE JOB LOSS, DIVORCE, SURPRISE

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
MEDICAL BILLS, OR PERHAPS EVEN

14:25.000 --> 14:26.000
-- Y'KNOW -- A ONCE IN A CENTURY

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
GLOBAL PANDEMIC.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
AND DESPITE BANKRUPTCY OFTEN

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
BEING CHARACTERIZED AS AN

14:31.000 --> 14:34.000
"EASY OUT," THE WAY IT'S

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
CURRENTLY SET UP, IT'S SOMETIMES

14:35.000 --> 14:35.000
NOT AN "OUT" AT ALL, AS THIS

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
COUPLE LEARNED.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
>> BEFORE YOU'RE DONE AND OVER

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
WITH, YOU'RE DEFINITELY LOOKING

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
TO SPEND AT LEAST $1,000 TO

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
FILE -- TO CLAIM BANKRUPTCY.

14:44.000 --> 14:47.000
WE DON'T HAVE $1,000.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
>> ARE YOU TELLING ME YOU CAN'T

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
AFFORD --

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
>> WE CAN'T AFFORD TO GO

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
BANKRUPT.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
>> WE CAN'T, CORRECT.

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
>> YET, WE'RE $50,000 IN DEBT.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
SO, WHAT DO WE DO?

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
>> John: YEAH, A LOT OF PEOPLE

14:58.000 --> 15:01.000
CAN'T AFFORD TO GO BANKRUPT.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
A TRUE SENTENCE THAT

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
FUNDAMENTALLY DOESN'T MAKE

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
SENSE, LIKE "SONIC DRIVE-INS

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
ADVERTISE IN CITIES WHERE THERE

15:08.000 --> 15:09.000
ARE NO SONIC LOCATIONS" OR

15:09.000 --> 15:10.000
THE SEQUEL TO "NOW YOU SEE ME"

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
WASN'T CALLED "NOW YOU DON'T,"

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
OR ELON MUSK DOESN'T FUCK HIS

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
CARS.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
I MEAN, COME ON, THAT'S THE

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
FACE OF A MAN WHO'S AT THE VERY

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
LEAST MEASURED THE CIRCUMFERENCE

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
OF THE CHARGING POINT.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
SO GIVEN ALL THAT, TONIGHT,

15:23.000 --> 15:23.000
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT PERSONAL

15:23.000 --> 15:26.000
BANKRUPTCY.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
OUR MODERN BANKRUPTCY CODE

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
WAS ENACTED IN 1978 --

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
INTERESTINGLY, AROUND THE SAME

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
TIME THAT THE CREDIT CARD

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
INDUSTRY BEGAN TO ENJOY A PERIOD

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
OF STEADY DEREGULATION.

15:34.000 --> 15:37.000
WHICH WORKED OUT VERY WELL FOR

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
THEM, BECAUSE THEY MARKETED

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
THEMSELVES AGGRESSIVELY, AND

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
DURING THIS TIME, CONSUMER DEBT

15:42.000 --> 15:43.000
BEGAN TO SHARPLY RISE.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
AND WHAT THE INDUSTRY CLEARLY

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
WANTED WAS PEOPLE STUCK IN A

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
LUCRATIVE CYCLE OF MINIMUM

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
PAYMENTS, LATE FEES, AND

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
INTEREST HIKES.

15:51.000 --> 15:54.000
WHAT THEY DIDN'T WANT SPOILING

15:54.000 --> 15:54.000
THAT WAS PEOPLE CUTTING THAT

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
CYCLE SHORT THROUGH BANKRUPTCY.

15:55.000 --> 15:58.000
SO BY THE LATE '90s,

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
THEY WERE LOBBYING SENATORS LIKE

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
CHUCK GRASSLEY HARD TO CURB WHAT

16:00.000 --> 16:03.000
THEY FRAMED AS "BANKRUPTCY

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
ABUSE."

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
BASICALLY ARGUING THAT PEOPLE

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
WHO CAN "AFFORD" TO PAY WERE

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
USING BANKRUPTCY AS AN EASY WAY

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
TO NOT PAY BILLS AND PASS THE

16:09.000 --> 16:14.000
COSTS ON TO THE REST OF US.

16:14.000 --> 16:17.000
AND GRASSLEY SEEMED MORE THAN

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
HAPPY TO REPEAT SOME OF THEIR

16:18.000 --> 16:18.000
TALKING POINTS.

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
>> THERE'S NOT A SINGLE FAMILY

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
IN AMERICA -- LOW INCOME OR HIGH

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
INCOME -- THAT IS NOT PAYING

16:22.000 --> 16:25.000
PART OF THE COST OF BANKRUPTCY.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
$40 BILLION COST TO THE ECONOMY

16:27.000 --> 16:28.000
EVERY YEAR.

16:28.000 --> 16:31.000
$400 FOR A FAMILY OF FOUR.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
>> John: WOW.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
THE AVERAGE FAMILY PAYS $400

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
A YEAR BECAUSE DEADBEATS

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
ABUSE THE SYSTEM.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
GRASSLEY DROPPED THAT SHOCKING

16:39.000 --> 16:40.000
"FACT" WITH THE CONFIDENCE OF

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
A MAN WHO'D LATER TWEET FROM HIS

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
GOVERNMENT ACCOUNT,

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
"WINDSOR HEIGHTS DAIRY QUEEN IS

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
GOOD PLACE FOR U KNO WHAT."

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
THE THING IS, THAT $400 FIGURE

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
IS TOTAL NONSENSE.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
NO ONE KNOWS FOR CERTAIN WHERE

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
IT CAME FROM, AND DESPITE IT

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
TURNING OUT TO BE DEMONSTRABLY

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
FALSE, THE CREDIT CARD INDUSTRY

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
PUSHED IT HARD, TO CREATE

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
A NARRATIVE OF WIDESPREAD

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
IRRESPONSIBILITY AND ABUSE

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
AROUND BANKRUPTCY.

17:02.000 --> 17:05.000
BUT IT'S A LITTLE HARD TO TAKE

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
MORAL GRANDSTANDING FROM CREDIT

17:06.000 --> 17:07.000
CARD COMPANIES, WHO WERE ALL

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
TOO HAPPY TO HELP PEOPLE GET

17:09.000 --> 17:10.000
INTO SIGNIFICANT DEBT, EVEN IF

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
THEY HAD JUST DECLARED

17:11.000 --> 17:14.000
BANKRUPTCY.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.000
>> BARELY OUT OF BANKRUPTCY

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
COURT, JOAN BURNETT OPENED HER

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
MAILBOX AND THERE IT WAS: THE

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
CHANCE FOR A SHINY NEW CREDIT

17:21.000 --> 17:24.000
CARD, THE FIRST OF MANY.

17:24.000 --> 17:27.000
>> IT LOOKED LIKE AN EASY $3,000

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
AND I THINK I HUNG ON TO IT FOR

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
A DAY, AND THEN I THOUGHT, "OH

17:30.000 --> 17:30.000
NO.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.000
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE THAT

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
CRAZY."

17:32.000 --> 17:33.000
>> THE BANKS ARE GIVING OUT

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
CREDIT WITH A RECKLESS DISREGARD

17:35.000 --> 17:36.000
FOR CONSUMERS' ABILITY TO

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
REPAY.

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
>> John: YEAH, THAT MAX WEINBERG

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
IMPERSONATOR IS RIGHT.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
AND SO, BY THE WAY, WAS JOAN,

17:43.000 --> 17:44.000
WHOSE SELF-RESTRAINT I REALLY

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
ADMIRE.

17:46.000 --> 17:47.000
IMAGINE THE EXPENDITURES I COULD

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
HAVE AVOIDED BY SIMPLY SAYING,

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
"NO, JOHN, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
BE THAT CRAZY, ASK YOURSELF,

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
DO YOU REALLY NEED THIS ITEM?"

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
BUT YEARS OF LOBBYING BY THE

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
CREDIT CARD AND BANKING INDUSTRY

17:58.000 --> 17:59.000
ULTIMATELY RESULTED

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
IN A HUGELY SIGNIFICANT 2005

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
"BANKRUPTCY REFORM" BILL,

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
WHICH MADE IT FAR MORE

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
COMPLICATED TO FILE FOR

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
BANKRUPTCY THAN IT PREVIOUSLY

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
HAD BEEN -- WHICH IN TURN MADE

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
IT FAR MORE COSTLY, WHICH MEANT

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
MANY PEOPLE ENDED UP IN A

18:12.000 --> 18:13.000
SITUATION WHERE THEY COULDN'T

18:13.000 --> 18:16.000
AFFORD TO GO BANKRUPT.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
AND TO UNDERSTAND OUR CURRENT

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
SYSTEM, A KEY THING TO KNOW IS

18:19.000 --> 18:22.000
THERE IS NOT ONE MAIN KIND OF

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
PERSONAL BANKRUPTCY, THERE ARE

18:23.000 --> 18:24.000
ACTUALLY TWO: CHAPTER 7 AND

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
CHAPTER 13.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.000
CHAPTER 7 IS WHAT YOU COMMONLY

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
THINK OF AS BANKRUPTCY.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
YOUR DEBTS ARE MOSTLY WIPED OUT.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
AND WHILE YOU CAN HOLD ONTO A

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
FEW ESSENTIAL ASSETS BELOW A

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
CERTAIN THRESHOLD, THE REST CAN

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
THEN BE SOLD TO PAY OFF

18:39.000 --> 18:40.000
YOUR CREDITORS.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
IT TAKES A FEW MONTHS TO

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
COMPLETE, BUT THEN YOU GET YOUR

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
CHANCE AT A "FRESH START."

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
CHAPTER 13, HOWEVER, IS

18:47.000 --> 18:48.000
DIFFERENT.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
THAT IS MORE OF A REORGANIZATION

18:51.000 --> 18:51.000
OF DEBT.

18:51.000 --> 18:54.000
BASICALLY, YOUR FINANCES GET

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
EXAMINED TO WORK OUT HOW MUCH

18:55.000 --> 18:55.000
YOU CAN AFFORD TO PAY INTO A

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
REPAYMENT PLAN FOR THREE TO FIVE

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
YEARS.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
AND IF YOU MAKE ALL THE PAYMENTS

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
IN THAT PLAN, AT THE END OF IT,

19:00.000 --> 19:03.000
YOUR DEBTS DO GET DISCHARGED.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
AND THIS HAS ITS BENEFITS -- YOU

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
DON'T HAVE TO GIVE UP ASSETS

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
LIKE A HOUSE OR A CAR.

19:07.000 --> 19:11.000
BUT -- AND THIS IS A HUGE "BUT"

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
-- IF YOU MISS EVEN ONE PAYMENT,

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
YOUR CASE COULD BE DISMISSED AND

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
THE WHOLE DEAL IS OFF.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
YOU'RE ESSENTIALLY BACK AT

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
SQUARE ONE.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
AND THE UNCOMFORTABLE FACT IS,

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
THIS HAPPENS IN MOST CHAPTER 13

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
CASES, BECAUSE ONLY ABOUT A

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
THIRD ACTUALLY MAKE IT

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
ALL THE WAY TO DISCHARGE.

19:27.000 --> 19:30.000
AND CHAPTER 13 IS ACTUALLY

19:30.000 --> 19:31.000
MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE TO FILE.

19:31.000 --> 19:35.000
BECAUSE WHILE ATTORNEYS CHARGE,

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
ON AVERAGE, ABOUT $1300 TO FILE

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
CHAPTER 7, FOR CHAPTER 13, THEY

19:39.000 --> 19:42.000
GENERALLY CHARGE ABOUT $3800.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.000
SO YOU MIGHT BE THINKING, IF

19:43.000 --> 19:43.000
CHAPTER 13 IS MORE COSTLY,

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
MORE DIFFICULT, AND LESS LIKELY

19:45.000 --> 19:46.000
TO GET YOU A GENUINELY FRESH

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
START, WHY WOULD ANYONE

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
CHOOSE IT?

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
WELL, FOR SOME, IT MIGHT BE

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
THE RIGHT FIT -- REMEMBER, IT

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
GIVES YOU A CHANCE TO KEEP YOUR

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
HOUSE, WHICH YOU MIGHT NEED TO

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
LIVE IN, AND YOUR CAR, WHICH YOU

19:56.000 --> 19:59.000
MIGHT NEED TO WORK.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
BUT FOR MANY, MANY MORE, CHAPTER

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
13 -- DESPITE COSTING THREE

20:03.000 --> 20:03.000
TIMES AS MUCH IN THE LONG TERM

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
-- CAN ACTUALLY SEEM LIKE THE

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
BETTER FINANCIAL OPTION WHEN

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
YOU FILE.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
BECAUSE CHAPTER 7 GENERALLY

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
REQUIRES YOU TO PAY LAWYERS UP

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
FRONT.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
WHEREAS CHAPTER 13 CAN BE

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
DIFFERENT, AS LAW FIRMS CAN BE

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
EAGER TO POINT OUT.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
>> IS DEBT CONSTANTLY ON YOUR

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
MIND?

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
ARE YOU LOOKING TO GET A FRESH

20:21.000 --> 20:22.000
START FINANCIALLY?

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
THEN CALL THE BANKRUPTCY

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
ATTORNEYS AT WOOTTON & WOOTTON.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
WE EVEN OFFER A NO MONEY DOWN

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
CHAPTER 13 PLAN.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
>> John: OKAY, FIRST, GET THE

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
FUCK OUT OF MY VOID, WOOTTON!

20:31.000 --> 20:34.000
I KNOW I DON'T TECHNICALLY OWN

20:34.000 --> 20:34.000
THE CONCEPT OF SAD, WHITE

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
EMPTINESS -- JARED LETO'S GOT

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
THE MARKET COVERED ON THAT ONE.

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
BUT I WILL BE DAMNED IF I LET

20:38.000 --> 20:39.000
THIS ADULT WHO LOOKS LIKE HE

20:40.000 --> 20:41.000
JUST MADE A WISH TO BE BIG STEAL

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
MY WHOLE VIBE.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
BUT THE POINT IS, IF YOU'RE

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
ALREADY IN A BAD SPOT WITH YOUR

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
FINANCES -- WHICH YOU PROBABLY

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
ARE, IF YOU'RE CONSIDERING

20:50.000 --> 20:51.000
BANKRUPTCY -- "NO MONEY UP

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
FRONT" MIGHT NOT JUST SOUND

20:52.000 --> 20:55.000
GOOD, IT MIGHT BE YOUR ONLY

20:55.000 --> 20:56.000
OPTION.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
THE WORRY IS THAT SOME LAWYERS

20:58.000 --> 20:59.000
GUIDE THEIR CLIENTS TO

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
THE MORE EXPENSIVE CHAPTER 13,

21:01.000 --> 21:02.000
WHEN THEY'D ACTUALLY BE FAR

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
BETTER SERVED WITH CHAPTER 7.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.000
AND IF YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT

21:05.000 --> 21:12.000
AMERICA, IT WON'T SURPRISE YOU

21:12.000 --> 21:15.000
THAT WOULD RESEARCHERS RAN AN

21:15.000 --> 21:19.000
ACADEMIC STUDY, THEY FOUND THAT

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
ATTORNEYS WERE MORE LIKELY TO

21:21.000 --> 21:24.000
OFFER A CHAPTER CHAPTER 13

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
BANKRUPTCY TO BLACK PEOPLE

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
RATHER THAN WHITE PEOPLE.

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
PUTTING ASIDE THE QUESTION OF

21:28.000 --> 21:31.000
WHETHER THE RESEARCHERS PLUCKED

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
REGGIE AND LETICIA FROM THE

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
HOPEFULLY NOT OFFENSIVELY SO

21:34.000 --> 21:37.000
BLACK NAMES, THE FINDINGS

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
EXPLAINED THAT THE ODDS OF BLACK

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
DEBTORS CHOOSING CHAPTER 13

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
INSTEAD OF CHAPTER 7

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
WERE MORE THAN TWICE AS HIGH AS

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
WHITE DEBTORS WITH A SIMILAR

21:44.000 --> 21:48.000
PROFILE.

21:48.000 --> 21:48.000
SO EVEN BANKRUPTCY

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
DISCRIMINATES AGAINST

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
BLACK PEOPLE.

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
WHICH IS, COINCIDENTALLY, THE

21:51.000 --> 21:51.000
COVER STORY ON THIS MONTH'S

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000
ISSUE OF "YEAH, NO SHIT"

21:52.000 --> 21:53.000
MAGAZINE.

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
AND THE FACT THAT PEOPLE ARE

21:54.000 --> 21:55.000
OFTEN PUSHED INTO THE FORM OF

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
BANKRUPTCY WITH FAR LESS

21:57.000 --> 21:58.000
SUCCESSFUL OUTCOMES MEANS THAT

21:58.000 --> 21:59.000
THEY CAN END UP HAVING TO FILE

21:59.000 --> 22:02.000
BANKRUPTCY AGAIN DOWN THE LINE.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.000
AND KNOWING THAT MAKES IT A

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
LITTLE HARD TO SEE FINANCIAL

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
EXPERTS LIKE SUZE ORMAN BROADLY

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
FRAME REPEATED FILING AS A MORAL

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
FAILING.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
>> MOST PEOPLE WHO CLAIM

22:12.000 --> 22:15.000
BANKRUPTCY ONCE CLAIM IT TWICE.

22:15.000 --> 22:18.000
SO IF YOU ARE CLAIMING

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
BANKRUPTCY, YOU HAVE GOT TO

22:19.000 --> 22:20.000
LEARN.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
BECAUSE IF YOU GET YOURSELF INTO

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
THAT SITUATION AGAIN, IF YOU GO

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
OUT AND YOU RACK UP ALL THIS

22:26.000 --> 22:27.000
CREDIT CARD DEBT AND ALL THIS

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
STUFF AGAIN, AND YOU HAVE TO

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
CLAIM BANKRUPTCY AGAIN, THEN I

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
SAY, SHAME ON YOU.

22:34.000 --> 22:38.000
>> John: WOW.

22:38.000 --> 22:39.000
SUZE IS OFFERING REPEAT

22:39.000 --> 22:40.000
BANKRUPTCY FILERS THE

22:40.000 --> 22:41.000
"SHAME ON YOU" NORMALLY RESERVED

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
FOR DOGS WHO PEED ON THE CARPET

22:43.000 --> 22:44.000
AND NOSY PHARMACISTS IN

22:44.000 --> 22:45.000
"MAGNOLIA" WHO'VE ASKED

22:45.000 --> 22:46.000
JULIANNE MOORE ONE TOO MANY

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
QUESTIONS.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.000
"I HAVE SICKNESS ALL AROUND ME

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
AND YOU FUCKING ASK ME MY LIFE?

22:51.000 --> 22:52.000
HAVE YOU SEEN DEATH IN YOUR BED?

22:52.000 --> 22:53.000
IN YOUR HOUSE?

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
WHERE'S YOUR FUCKING DECENCY?

22:55.000 --> 22:55.000
AND THEN I'M ASKED FUCKING

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
QUESTIONS.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.000
WHAT'S WRONG?

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
YOU SUCK MY DICK.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
THAT'S WHAT'S WRONG.

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
AND YOU, YOU FUCKING CALL ME

23:03.000 --> 23:04.000
"LADY?"

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
SHAME ON YOU.

23:06.000 --> 23:10.000
SHAME ON YOU!"

23:10.000 --> 23:11.000
BUT A FEW THINGS.

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
FIRST, EXPERTS SAY ORMAN'S CLAIM

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
THAT MOST BANKRUPTCY FILERS FILE

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
TWICE IS JUST WRONG.

23:17.000 --> 23:18.000
BUT MUCH MORE IMPORTANTLY,

23:19.000 --> 23:20.000
EVEN THOSE WHO DO END UP FILING

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
A SECOND TIME, OFTEN DO SO

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
DUE TO FACTORS THAT HAVE NOTHING

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
TO DO WITH RECKLESSNESS -- LIKE,

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
FOR INSTANCE, GETTING A

23:27.000 --> 23:28.000
CHAPTER 13 BANKRUPTCY THAT

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
WASN'T RIGHT FOR THEM.

23:30.000 --> 23:31.000
AND THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE THAT

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
CAN SIGNIFICANTLY LIMIT THE HELP

23:33.000 --> 23:34.000
BANKRUPTCY CAN PROVIDE --

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
BECAUSE THERE ARE WHOLE

23:36.000 --> 23:37.000
CATEGORIES OF "NON-DISCHARGEABLE

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
DEBTS" -- DEBTS THAT EVEN

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
BANKRUPTCY CAN'T GET RID OF.

23:41.000 --> 23:42.000
YOU TYPICALLY CAN'T WIPE OUT

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
DEBT FROM CRIMINAL PENALTIES,

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
TAXES, OR CHILD SUPPORT THROUGH

23:46.000 --> 23:49.000
BANKRUPTCY -- AND THERE'S

23:49.000 --> 23:50.000
ANOTHER, MASSIVE CATEGORY, AS

23:50.000 --> 23:51.000
THIS WOMAN LEARNED.

23:51.000 --> 23:52.000
>> 31-YEAR-OLD RADMILLA

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
SULEYMANOVA GRADUATED WITH A

23:54.000 --> 23:55.000
MASTERS FROM NEW YORK UNIVERSITY

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
IN 2008 DURING THE DEPTHS OF THE

23:57.000 --> 24:00.000
GREAT RECESSION.

24:00.000 --> 24:06.000
JOBLESS, SHE QUICKLY DEFAULTED

24:06.000 --> 24:07.000
ON HER $80,000 STUDENT LOAN

24:07.000 --> 24:08.000
BILL.

24:08.000 --> 24:09.000
>> OH, WELL, I'LL JUST FILE FOR

24:09.000 --> 24:10.000
BANKRUPTCY LIKE EVERYONE ELSE IS

24:10.000 --> 24:11.000
DOING, HA-HA-HA.

24:11.000 --> 24:12.000
AND THEN YOU REALIZE...

24:12.000 --> 24:13.000
NO.

24:13.000 --> 24:14.000
THE ONLY WAY TO GET AWAY FROM

24:14.000 --> 24:14.000
YOUR STUDENT LOAN DEBT IS TO

24:14.000 --> 24:15.000
DIE.

24:15.000 --> 24:19.000
>> John: YEAH.

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
AND TO COMMUNICATE JUST HOW BAD

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
STUDENT LOAN DEBT IS AS A

24:22.000 --> 24:23.000
GENERATIONAL DEAD WEIGHT ON

24:23.000 --> 24:24.000
MILLENNIALS, I GUARANTEE YOU

24:24.000 --> 24:27.000
ANYONE WITH STUDENT LOANS

24:27.000 --> 24:28.000
WATCHING THIS HEARD "$80,000

24:28.000 --> 24:29.000
AND THOUGHT "OH, I

24:29.000 --> 24:30.000
DUNNO, I'VE HEARD WORSE."

24:31.000 --> 24:31.000
BECAUSE, YEAH, SHE COULD HAVE

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
BOUGHT THIS ENTIRE THREE

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
BEDROOM, TWO BATHROOM HOUSE

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
IN INDIANAPOLIS, BUT WHO REALLY

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
NEEDS A PLACE TO LIVE WHEN YOU

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
HAVE A FRAMED 8.5 X 11 PIECE OF

24:39.000 --> 24:40.000
PAPER WITH YOUR NAME ON IT?

24:40.000 --> 24:41.000
THAT CAN, JUST LIKE A HOUSE,

24:41.000 --> 24:45.000
KEEP YOU SAFE FROM THE RAIN.

24:45.000 --> 24:46.000
AND IF ALL THAT WEREN'T BAD

24:46.000 --> 24:47.000
ENOUGH, OUR CURRENT SYSTEM ADDS

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
INSULT TO INJURY THROUGH

24:49.000 --> 24:50.000
MANDATORY CREDIT COUNSELING

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
COURSES.

24:52.000 --> 24:53.000
WHICH CAN BE EXACTLY AS

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
PATRONIZING AS THEY SOUND.

24:55.000 --> 24:56.000
EVEN BANKRUPTCY JUDGES HAVE

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
CALLED THEM "INANE" AND "A

24:59.000 --> 25:00.000
PROCEDURAL HURDLE WITHOUT VALUE

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
OR CONSEQUENCE."

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
WITH ONE EVEN NOTING A COURSE

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
REFERRED PARTICIPANTS "TO THE

25:06.000 --> 25:07.000
LOCAL LIBRARY FOR RESOURCES ON

25:07.000 --> 25:08.000
BANKRUPTCY."

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
AND RECOMMENDED THEY "SEEK A JOB

25:10.000 --> 25:11.000
MAKING HIGHER WAGES" AND I'M

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
SURE THEY'D NEVER THOUGHT OF

25:13.000 --> 25:16.000
DOING THAT BEFORE IT WAS

25:16.000 --> 25:17.000
VERY CLEVERLY POINTED OUT TO

25:17.000 --> 25:17.000
THEM.

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
AND IF IT SEEMS THESE COURSES

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
MAY HAVE LIMITED VALUE,

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
ONE WE FOUND ONLINE EVEN SEEMED

25:22.000 --> 25:23.000
TO RELUCTANTLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT

25:23.000 --> 25:24.000
FACT.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.000
>> YOUR ATTORNEY MAY HAVE GONE

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
OVER YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION

25:27.000 --> 25:28.000
WITH YOU IN THEIR OFFICE

25:28.000 --> 25:29.000
ALREADY.

25:29.000 --> 25:30.000
PERHAPS THEY EXPLAINED WHY

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
CREDIT COUNSELING WILL NOT WORK

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
FOR YOU.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
MANY DEBTORS THEREFORE BELIEVE

25:34.000 --> 25:35.000
THAT THIS MANDATORY CREDIT

25:35.000 --> 25:38.000
COUNSELING EXERCISE IS

25:38.000 --> 25:39.000
POINTLESS.

25:39.000 --> 25:40.000
WE HOPE INSTEAD YOU TAKE A MORE

25:40.000 --> 25:41.000
POSITIVE VIEW OF THIS MANDATORY

25:41.000 --> 25:42.000
COURSE.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.000
>> John: OH, YOU HOPE SO,

25:43.000 --> 25:44.000
DO YOU?

25:44.000 --> 25:45.000
THAT'S BASICALLY AN ADMISSION

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
THAT IT'S A WASTE OF TIME.

25:47.000 --> 25:48.000
ALTHOUGH, QUICK QUESTION, WHY IS

25:49.000 --> 25:50.000
THE ATTORNEY THERE CARTOON ME?

25:50.000 --> 25:51.000
HE'S WEARING MY GLASSES.

25:51.000 --> 25:52.000
HE HAS MY BANGS.

25:52.000 --> 25:53.000
HE'S NEGGING AN UNWILLING

25:54.000 --> 25:55.000
CIVILIAN WHILE WAVING AROUND

25:55.000 --> 25:58.000
A BORING AMOUNT OF PAPERWORK.

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
THE GUY IS MORE ME THAN I AM.

25:59.000 --> 26:00.000
BUT WHILE AT BEST, AN

26:00.000 --> 26:01.000
OBJECTIVELY HUNKY CARTOON

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
LECTURING YOU ON YOUR FINANCES

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
IS ANNOYING -- AT WORST, IT CAN

26:05.000 --> 26:06.000
BE ACTIVELY INSULTING.

26:06.000 --> 26:07.000
BECAUSE THE ASSUMPTION IN THESE

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
COURSES IS THAT YOU'RE IN THIS

26:09.000 --> 26:10.000
POSITION DUE TO RECKLESS

26:10.000 --> 26:11.000
PERSONAL BEHAVIOR.

26:11.000 --> 26:14.000
BUT IMAGINE HOW THAT ARGUMENT

26:14.000 --> 26:15.000
FEELS IF YOU -- LIKE THIS WOMAN

26:15.000 --> 26:15.000
-- WENT BANKRUPT AFTER HAVING TO

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
LEAVE YOUR JOB TO TAKE CARE OF

26:17.000 --> 26:18.000
YOUR SON, WHO DIED FROM

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
CYSTIC FIBROSIS.

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
>> IN SEPTEMBER, WE SAT DOWN

26:22.000 --> 26:25.000
TO TAKE THE CREDIT COUNSELING

26:25.000 --> 26:25.000
COURSE AND IT WAS SORT OF A SLAP

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
IN THE FACE, HONESTLY.

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
AND WE HAVE NOT YET FINISHED

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
THAT COURSE.

26:30.000 --> 26:31.000
WE LOGGED OFF AND NEEDED TO WALK

26:31.000 --> 26:32.000
AWAY FROM IT FOR A LITTLE

26:32.000 --> 26:38.000
WHILE.

26:38.000 --> 26:39.000
AND WE'LL

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
NEED TO DO IT AGAIN AFTER WE

26:41.000 --> 26:41.000
ACTUALLY GO THROUGH THE FILING

26:41.000 --> 26:42.000
PROCESS AND MEET WITH THE JUDGE.

26:42.000 --> 26:43.000
IT'S A REQUIREMENT AFTER YOU

26:43.000 --> 26:44.000
FILE, AS WELL, SO THAT YOU CAN,

26:44.000 --> 26:44.000
I GUESS, GET AN IDEA OF HOW TO

26:44.000 --> 26:45.000
NOT DO THE SAME THING AGAIN IN

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
SO.

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
WHICH IS AN INCREDIBLY HURTFUL

26:51.000 --> 26:52.000

26:52.000 --> 26:53.000
FORWARD TO.

26:53.000 --> 26:54.000
>> John: NO, OF COURSE YOU'RE

26:54.000 --> 26:55.000
NOT.

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
BECAUSE HAVING A COURSE SUGGEST

26:57.000 --> 26:58.000
THERE'S A WAY NOT TO HAVE YOUR

26:58.000 --> 26:59.000
CHILD DIE AGAIN IN THE FUTURE IS

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
A FUCKING INSULT.

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
AND IT'S TERRIBLE THAT SHE NOT

27:03.000 --> 27:04.000
ONLY HAD TO GO THROUGH THAT,

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
BUT THEN HAD TO REHASH IT IN THE

27:06.000 --> 27:07.000

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
REQUIREMENT CHANGED -- WHICH, BY

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
THE WAY, IT WASN'T.

27:11.000 --> 27:12.000
AND THE TRUTH IS, SO MUCH OF

27:12.000 --> 27:13.000
WHAT IS WRONG WITH OUR CURRENT

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
BANKRUPTCY SYSTEM STEMS FROM

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
THAT 2005 LAW THAT I MENTIONED

27:17.000 --> 27:18.000
EARLIER.

27:18.000 --> 27:19.000
EXPANDING THE

27:19.000 --> 27:19.000
NON-DISCHARGEABILITY OF

27:19.000 --> 27:20.000
STUDENT LOAN DEBT?

27:20.000 --> 27:21.000
THAT WAS IN THERE.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
THE MANDATORY CREDIT COUNSELING

27:23.000 --> 27:24.000
CLASSES?

27:24.000 --> 27:25.000
THAT WAS IN THERE, TOO.

27:25.000 --> 27:26.000
THE LAW ALSO MADE BANKRUPTCY

27:26.000 --> 27:27.000
HARDER TO COMPLETE, ADDING OVER

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
A DOZEN WAYS SOMEONE COULD MAKE

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
A TECHNICAL ERROR AND BE

27:31.000 --> 27:32.000
DISMISSED.

27:32.000 --> 27:32.000
IT WAS A HUGE WIN FOR

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
THE CREDIT CARD COMPANIES.

27:34.000 --> 27:35.000
AND FOR ALL THE ASSURANCES

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
FROM GRASSLEY AND OTHERS THAT IT

27:37.000 --> 27:38.000
WOULD TARGET HIGH-INCOME PEOPLE

27:38.000 --> 27:42.000
ABUSING THE SYSTEM WITHOUT

27:42.000 --> 27:43.000
HURTING THOSE OF LESSER MEANS,

27:43.000 --> 27:44.000
AFTER IT PASSED, BANKRUPTCY

27:44.000 --> 27:45.000
FILINGS DROPPED

27:45.000 --> 27:46.000
DISPROPORTIONATELY IN POORER

27:46.000 --> 27:47.000
NEIGHBORHOODS, WITH FILINGS

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
THERE DECREASING 32% MORE THAN

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
IN RICH ONES.

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
SHOWING THAT AS ALWAYS, WHEN

27:53.000 --> 27:54.000
THINGS ARE DESIGNED TO BECOME

27:54.000 --> 27:55.000
HARDER FOR EVERYONE, FOR THE

27:55.000 --> 27:56.000
RICH, THEY JUST BECOME A BIT

27:56.000 --> 27:57.000
MORE EXPENSIVE, AND FOR THE

27:57.000 --> 27:58.000
POOR, THEY BECOME BASICALLY

27:58.000 --> 27:59.000
IMPOSSIBLE.

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
SO WHAT CAN WE DO HERE?

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
WELL, IDEALLY, THE PEOPLE

28:03.000 --> 28:04.000
RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT 2005 LAW

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
WOUL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT OUR

28:06.000 --> 28:07.000
SYSTEM BADLY NEEDS FIXING.

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
AND COINCIDENTALLY, ONE OF THE

28:09.000 --> 28:10.000
MOST PROMINENT BACKERS OF THAT

28:10.000 --> 28:11.000
LAW IS ACTUALLY THE FUCKING

28:11.000 --> 28:14.000
PRESIDENT NOW.

28:14.000 --> 28:15.000
JOE BIDEN IS FROM DELAWARE,

28:15.000 --> 28:16.000
HOME TO SOME OF THE BIGGEST

28:17.000 --> 28:18.000

28:18.000 --> 28:19.000

28:19.000 --> 28:22.000
IN GETTING THE 2005 LAW PASSED.

28:22.000 --> 28:23.000

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000

28:25.000 --> 28:26.000

28:26.000 --> 28:27.000
ELIZABETH WARREN -- THEN A

28:28.000 --> 28:29.000
HARVARD LAW PROFESSOR STUDYING

28:29.000 --> 28:30.000

29:30.000 --> 29:31.000
MEDICAL DEBT IS OUT OF CONTROL,

29:42.000 --> 29:43.000
THE "CONSUMER BANKRUPTCY REFORM

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000

29:46.000 --> 29:47.000
OVERHAUL OUR BANKRUPTCY SYSTEM,

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
IT WOULD ELIMINATE EXCESSIVE

29:49.000 --> 29:50.000
PAPERWORK NEEDED FOR FILING,

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
THEREBY LOWERING ATTORNEY COSTS.

29:52.000 --> 29:53.000
IT'D MAKE STUDENT LOAN DEBT

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
DISCHARGEABLE, IT'D GET RID OF

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
THE REQUIREMENT FOR A CREDIT

29:57.000 --> 29:58.000
COUNSELING COURSE, AND IT'D

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
COMBINE CHAPTERS 7 AND 13 INTO A

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
NEW, MORE FLEXIBLE CHAPTER 10.

30:02.000 --> 30:03.000
IT'S A COMBINATION THAT WOULD BE

30:03.000 --> 30:04.000

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
