01:20.146 --> 01:23.843
Shinjuku Station Tokyo

01:25.552 --> 01:28.350
May 26

02:51.938 --> 02:57.843
Tokyo-bound express
now arriving on Track 8.

02:58.845 --> 03:03.407
For your safety, please
stay behind the yellow line.

03:50.296 --> 03:55.165
A one... and a two...

03:55.268 --> 03:57.702
...and a three!

04:47.120 --> 04:50.055
Suicide Circle

04:50.690 --> 04:54.560
Hi, everybody. We're Dessert.

04:54.560 --> 05:01.334
Mail me. Hurry and hit the send key.
Can 't you see? I've waited patiently.

05:01.334 --> 05:08.174
Mail me. To my phone or PC, I'm
ready to tell you that I'm standing by.

05:08.174 --> 05:14.714
Mail me. I want to let you know as
friends go, yours is the best hello.

05:14.714 --> 05:20.778
Mail me. I'm sure you never knew, how I
feel about you, this is real, I need to...

05:20.853 --> 05:24.016
...hear from you right now or I'll die.

06:07.700 --> 06:10.567
I've gotta eat. Want anything?

06:10.703 --> 06:12.227
Yeah I do.

06:12.472 --> 06:14.167
Is the bakery okay?

06:14.440 --> 06:17.500
Sure. Get me a curry roll.

06:17.643 --> 06:18.701
And a drink?

06:18.878 --> 06:20.505
Get coffee.

06:20.646 --> 06:21.476
Okay.

06:21.714 --> 06:22.874
Thanks.

07:27.113 --> 07:27.772
Darn.

07:31.517 --> 07:36.079
We interrupt this program
for a special news bulletin.

07:40.993 --> 07:41.925
Evening.

07:42.762 --> 07:43.854
Oh, hello.

07:44.397 --> 07:47.560
Hey, you won't belive the news.

07:47.700 --> 07:48.257
What?

07:48.401 --> 07:53.737
50 high school girls just threw
themselves in front of a train.

07:54.006 --> 07:55.030
No way!

07:55.107 --> 07:56.096
Really!

07:56.375 --> 07:58.639
Studying too hard again?

07:58.744 --> 08:00.012
I'm serious.

08:00.012 --> 08:00.637
Let me out.

08:01.948 --> 08:03.882
Wait, listen to this.

08:05.451 --> 08:09.182
There's mass confusion
here on the the platform.

08:09.655 --> 08:12.715
This is unprecedented.

08:22.835 --> 08:23.824
There you go.

08:24.237 --> 08:26.501
Thanks, leave it open.

08:26.572 --> 08:27.368
Okay.

08:35.448 --> 08:38.474
What's the scene like right now?

08:39.118 --> 08:43.077
All lines have stopped running completely.

08:43.422 --> 08:45.686
No word on their resumption.

08:46.025 --> 08:48.425
Have the victims been identified?

08:48.528 --> 08:54.489
The police are working on it,
but none have been made yet.

08:55.134 --> 08:59.867
We first reported that it
was 50 highschool girls...

08:59.972 --> 09:02.372
...who jumped the tracks.

09:02.508 --> 09:07.946
But we've since learned it
was actually 54 students.

09:23.462 --> 09:24.724
Hello?

09:31.237 --> 09:32.636
Anyone there?

09:38.678 --> 09:39.667
Hello?

10:14.280 --> 10:15.372
Hello?

10:17.416 --> 10:18.781
Ms. Kawaguchi?

10:19.352 --> 10:20.614
Jiro?

10:20.786 --> 10:22.151
You scared me.

10:22.521 --> 10:24.857
Have you seen Akko?

10:24.857 --> 10:26.154
Yes, I have.

10:26.559 --> 10:28.026
She still out?

10:28.260 --> 10:29.818
I guess so.

10:30.096 --> 10:33.088
That's strange. The store is so close.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.661
Yeah, I guess it is.

10:35.901 --> 10:37.596
What's keeping her?

10:39.538 --> 10:41.904
I don't know.

10:43.142 --> 10:44.473
Well whatever.

10:44.977 --> 10:47.445
I'll call you when she returns.

10:47.747 --> 10:48.941
Thanks.

12:52.938 --> 12:53.996
Ms. Kawaguchi?

13:53.532 --> 13:54.692
Ms. Sawada?

13:56.135 --> 13:58.729
Ms. Kawaguchi?

13:59.905 --> 14:00.837
Nurse Kawaguchi?

14:02.374 --> 14:03.568
Yoko Kawaguchi?

14:08.080 --> 14:12.517
What an ordeal that turned out to be.

14:14.153 --> 14:15.882
I think the power's out.

14:16.322 --> 14:20.486
The bakery is closed so I walked all over.

14:21.193 --> 14:23.684
Did Ms. Kawaguchi go home?

14:23.929 --> 14:25.362
I'm beat.

14:26.298 --> 14:28.323
Hey, where's Yoko?

14:29.001 --> 14:31.435
I think she went home.

14:31.971 --> 14:33.165
Oh.

14:38.377 --> 14:40.641
You want her food.

14:41.714 --> 14:44.842
Um... sure.

14:45.050 --> 14:45.641
Here.

14:56.662 --> 14:59.187
Ah, that feels good.

15:01.166 --> 15:02.690
I'll see you later.

15:06.972 --> 15:08.200
What're you doing?

15:33.766 --> 15:36.929
You've still got blood on you.

15:38.304 --> 15:39.100
Your shoes.

15:43.842 --> 15:44.740
Where's Kuroda?

15:45.911 --> 15:47.139
We're all here.

15:56.789 --> 15:59.952
Listen up. This was not a crime.

16:00.693 --> 16:02.786
It's an accident.

16:03.862 --> 16:07.229
Stop looking so glum.

16:08.500 --> 16:13.335
They weren't all from the
same high school, were they?

16:13.572 --> 16:15.164
No, they weren't.

16:16.075 --> 16:19.476
So far we know it's 18 schools.

16:19.578 --> 16:20.602
The connection.

16:20.980 --> 16:22.845
It wasn't a crime.

16:22.982 --> 16:24.074
I'll check it out.

16:25.818 --> 16:28.878
It may have been some sort of cult.

16:29.755 --> 16:33.213
A suicide cult? Ridiculous.

16:35.060 --> 16:35.822
Excuse me.

16:39.064 --> 16:40.725
Phone call.

16:44.570 --> 16:48.131
I'd say it's too much TV, "The Pied Piper."

16:54.980 --> 16:56.106
Shibu here.

16:56.849 --> 17:00.114
It's bothered me for a while.

17:01.687 --> 17:02.585
What has?

17:03.856 --> 17:06.790
You know, the suicides.

17:08.894 --> 17:10.919
Yeah... go on...

17:12.064 --> 17:13.554
You at a computer?

17:14.098 --> 17:15.156
Yes.

17:16.435 --> 17:20.269
I've got a web site for you to look at.

17:21.272 --> 17:22.069
Hold on.

17:23.175 --> 17:24.436
Call everyone.

17:29.181 --> 17:30.148
Go ahead.

17:30.315 --> 17:36.550
www.maru...

17:36.955 --> 17:41.016
.... Ne. Jp

17:42.961 --> 17:44.087
What is this?

17:44.830 --> 17:48.960
The red dots... are women.

17:49.401 --> 17:51.460
The white ones are men.

17:52.171 --> 17:53.069
What's it mean?

17:53.405 --> 17:56.397
I had a hunch when I first saw it...

17:56.642 --> 17:59.110
...but after today, I'm sure of it.

18:00.379 --> 18:03.507
There were 54 new red dots.

18:03.949 --> 18:06.645
There are even more now.

18:06.885 --> 18:08.819
When did you find this?

18:10.889 --> 18:12.413
When did you find this?

18:12.758 --> 18:16.387
Recently. It intrigued me.

18:17.129 --> 18:20.030
After those 4 suicides the other day...

18:20.699 --> 18:22.690
...I saw 4 more dots.

18:22.901 --> 18:26.098
It's a weird site. This is all there is.

18:26.805 --> 18:28.466
Check out the provider.

18:30.275 --> 18:35.110
Tell me what you find,
okay? I'll do the same.

18:36.381 --> 18:37.405
Understood.

18:39.518 --> 18:40.883
And you would be?

18:42.154 --> 18:42.950
The Bat.

18:43.555 --> 18:46.183
No, I mean your real name.

18:47.192 --> 18:48.625
The Bat's fine.

18:50.496 --> 18:52.760
All right, "The Bat" it is.

18:53.732 --> 18:55.893
Do you have a web site?

18:56.768 --> 19:02.297
I post on a BBS a lot,
look for The Bat there.

19:02.741 --> 19:03.469
Gotcha.

19:04.676 --> 19:14.745
www.jikennews.com

19:15.787 --> 19:16.776
Gotta go now.

19:17.156 --> 19:18.145
Wait.

19:18.457 --> 19:25.021
Oh yeah, the dots appear before
the suicides are reported.

19:27.299 --> 19:28.891
Anyway, good luck.

19:29.201 --> 19:30.896
Hello? Hello?

19:33.505 --> 19:34.301
She hung up.

19:36.742 --> 19:39.472
We've got another suicide.

19:45.851 --> 19:47.443
Go talk to the witnesses.

19:59.865 --> 20:00.763
Jesus!

20:05.070 --> 20:05.468
May 27

20:07.005 --> 20:08.870
Yeah, there was a...

20:09.274 --> 20:10.298
Sports bag?

20:10.409 --> 20:11.467
Yes.

20:21.286 --> 20:24.847
It was found on the platform at the time.

20:25.057 --> 20:26.684
Yeah, here it is.

20:32.898 --> 20:36.231
Could you wait outside for a minute?

20:36.368 --> 20:37.232
Why?

20:37.302 --> 20:38.064
Please.

20:38.237 --> 20:41.297
All right. Knock when you are finished.

21:52.311 --> 21:53.505
Same thing.

21:54.346 --> 21:58.476
It may not be the same
person, but it's human skin.

21:58.850 --> 22:00.044
That is certain.

22:02.354 --> 22:05.448
The stitches are the same size.

22:06.358 --> 22:08.258
Identical work.

22:09.261 --> 22:13.322
The skin is stitched 10 centimeters apart.

22:13.398 --> 22:15.457
There's so much of it.

22:15.567 --> 22:19.765
We're looking at an
incredible number of people.

22:20.872 --> 22:22.965
You think they're different people?

22:23.342 --> 22:27.142
We're not sure yet, but we think so.

22:28.547 --> 22:30.674
Each piece is different skin.

22:31.450 --> 22:37.082
It's possible that skin from the same
person is repeated somewhere...

22:37.456 --> 22:41.119
...if it's like the one found yesterday.

22:41.360 --> 22:45.490
So together, it's skin from
about 200 people then?

22:46.164 --> 22:49.258
You could say that... yes.

22:57.075 --> 23:01.876
There are several bodies here.
We'll pry them apart later.

23:02.481 --> 23:04.608
Look here.

23:05.283 --> 23:10.050
We won't know until tomorrow,
but we're sure it's their skin.

23:12.758 --> 23:16.751
So the other 100 or so skin samples...

23:17.329 --> 23:19.354
...could be from living people?

23:20.198 --> 23:24.897
I have no idea... I'd prefer
it be from corpses, though.

23:26.471 --> 23:30.464
We'd have to check a lot of
murder and accident victims.

23:32.477 --> 23:36.277
Most have already been cremated.

23:37.682 --> 23:40.947
The remaining 100 are still to come.

23:42.988 --> 23:47.288
That's totally absurd, impossible.

23:59.704 --> 24:05.836
The Tokyo-bound train
now arriving on Track 8.

24:06.678 --> 24:11.138
For your safety, please
stay behind the yellow line.

24:26.698 --> 24:28.063
See you tomorrow.

24:28.300 --> 24:29.130
Good night.

24:49.921 --> 24:52.617
"No end to rash of suicides!"

25:37.335 --> 25:39.428
"Recent crime scene. Call
if you have information."

26:25.817 --> 26:27.045
Welcome home.

26:29.354 --> 26:30.651
What's with you?

26:34.459 --> 26:36.359
Nothing.

26:38.763 --> 26:39.855
Weirdo.

27:16.935 --> 27:20.462
Toru! Sakura!

27:22.340 --> 27:24.570
Come down here.

27:25.310 --> 27:26.402
What now?

27:31.149 --> 27:31.911
What?

27:32.150 --> 27:32.980
Sit.

27:33.385 --> 27:34.477
What is it?

27:34.619 --> 27:36.484
A family meeting.

27:36.721 --> 27:38.848
You're kidding.

27:39.190 --> 27:40.558
What's up?

27:40.558 --> 27:41.388
Indulge me.

27:41.826 --> 27:43.350
Dessert's on TV.

27:49.200 --> 27:50.335
"Mail me."

27:50.335 --> 27:51.802
Hey, listen up.

27:59.611 --> 28:01.135
What's got into you?

28:04.249 --> 28:05.341
Forget it.

28:08.253 --> 28:10.687
What's "Dessert"?

28:10.989 --> 28:11.717
"Mail me."

28:35.647 --> 28:38.445
May 28

29:03.575 --> 29:06.908
Why do we get the garbage detail?

29:06.978 --> 29:10.038
Let's just dump it on the roof.

29:10.148 --> 29:12.207
This totally sucks.

29:26.598 --> 29:28.225
Maybe, I'll kill myself too.

29:28.600 --> 29:29.589
Really?

29:29.834 --> 29:31.734
Do it with me.

29:31.836 --> 29:33.565
I will if you will.

29:36.808 --> 29:40.801
Question, what did you
think of the suicides?

29:41.179 --> 29:44.546
Freaky, I mean 54 girls! Can you believe it?

29:44.682 --> 29:47.150
Definitely a cult.

29:47.218 --> 29:50.210
Yeah, but why'd they wanna die?

29:51.156 --> 29:54.387
Hey! We're dumping this here, okay?

29:55.827 --> 29:57.795
It's a cult, I say.

29:58.596 --> 30:04.057
I heard there was so much
grease the train couldn't brake.

30:04.402 --> 30:05.926
It slipped on human grease.

30:06.037 --> 30:08.306
Gross!

30:08.306 --> 30:11.400
Hey, let's all kill ourselves.

30:11.576 --> 30:13.305
Yeah! I'm in!

30:13.912 --> 30:15.277
Not me!

30:15.613 --> 30:16.807
The Suicide Club.

30:17.949 --> 30:20.679
Let's get enough people to beat 54.

30:20.785 --> 30:22.218
100! Let's get 100!

30:22.453 --> 30:27.186
We'll pass out flyers.
"Join our Suicide Club."

30:27.792 --> 30:29.384
"Come die with us!"

30:30.061 --> 30:32.894
"Let's shed blood together."

30:34.899 --> 30:39.734
But before that, we party.
Lots of food and fornication.

30:40.872 --> 30:44.239
Pervert. Then you'd leave, right?

30:44.409 --> 30:46.741
Hey, you have my word.

30:48.112 --> 30:53.311
It's gotta hurt though.
Let's not do the train thing.

30:54.853 --> 30:56.218
Drug overdose?

30:56.754 --> 30:58.517
I like that.

30:58.690 --> 31:00.885
I could do that.

31:01.759 --> 31:03.124
Hey, you guys!

31:03.528 --> 31:05.257
What?

31:05.330 --> 31:06.592
Come watch me kill myself.

31:08.466 --> 31:10.127
Our newest member.

31:10.235 --> 31:10.997
Watch me, okay?

31:16.040 --> 31:17.598
Count me out.

31:21.846 --> 31:27.716
Suicide club! Suicide club!

31:27.986 --> 31:29.977
Jump! Jump!

31:30.054 --> 31:31.578
I'm dying now.

31:33.424 --> 31:34.721
Natsumi, stop.

31:34.792 --> 31:35.622
Here I go.

31:37.095 --> 31:40.064
You idiot! You have not intention of doing it!

31:40.431 --> 31:41.989
I'll show you for real.

31:43.735 --> 31:44.599
Me, too!

31:50.608 --> 31:52.473
On three okay?

31:52.543 --> 31:53.510
And hold hands.

31:53.611 --> 31:54.441
Okay?

31:55.713 --> 31:57.415
Wow, this is intense!

31:57.415 --> 31:58.347
No shit.

31:58.850 --> 32:00.715
One, two...

32:00.818 --> 32:02.376
Wait, time out!

32:03.187 --> 32:04.484
You serious?

32:04.555 --> 32:06.682
Dead serious. Let's go!

32:10.862 --> 32:13.990
Ready? A one and a two...

32:24.742 --> 32:27.711
Oh my god...

32:42.860 --> 32:44.851
Hey! Stop it!

32:45.263 --> 32:46.423
We gotta do it!

32:46.798 --> 32:47.765
Get away!

33:02.780 --> 33:06.079
Come down from there!

33:09.320 --> 33:10.252
Suicide club.

33:12.023 --> 33:16.426
We're the Suicide Club's founding chapter.

33:22.200 --> 33:28.230
I know it's hard. But if you
could, tell me what you know.

33:31.509 --> 33:34.342
First, it was Machi.

33:36.047 --> 33:37.207
Then Taka...

33:40.618 --> 33:43.212
She said "I'm dying now."

33:43.388 --> 33:44.719
I see.

33:45.423 --> 33:51.123
I didn't think she was serious.

33:53.231 --> 33:56.462
Then the others joined in.

33:56.601 --> 33:57.431
Hey, Kuroda.

34:03.474 --> 34:05.806
We don't seem to have
a sports bag this time.

34:08.980 --> 34:12.541
No, you're right.

34:22.693 --> 34:23.455
Hey.

34:25.763 --> 34:26.525
That.

34:29.333 --> 34:31.699
Scrape that off.

34:34.371 --> 34:37.068
Here comes an ear.

34:48.119 --> 34:52.886
We're going to have to open
a criminal investigation...

34:53.558 --> 34:55.116
...starting with the train suicides.

34:56.060 --> 34:59.461
We can't. These aren't criminals.

34:59.530 --> 35:00.656
I don't know.

35:01.466 --> 35:02.899
Something's going on...

35:03.434 --> 35:07.165
You're paranoid. It's a suicide fad.

35:08.272 --> 35:11.366
They're just highly impressionable kids.

35:11.742 --> 35:14.370
Not a word about a Suicide Club...

35:15.746 --> 35:18.078
...or kids will be dying all over Japan.

35:21.319 --> 35:24.049
May 29

35:35.800 --> 35:38.462
What happened? Call the police!

35:39.237 --> 35:40.135
And an ambulance!

35:42.206 --> 35:42.900
Masa?

35:43.808 --> 35:44.672
Mitsuko?

35:44.942 --> 35:45.670
Why?

35:46.444 --> 35:48.503
Sorry I hit you.

35:49.647 --> 35:50.978
Where'd you jump from?

35:55.520 --> 35:59.980
Why'd you do it, Masa?

36:00.458 --> 36:01.117
Sorry.

36:01.859 --> 36:06.262
But what a perfect coincidence
that I hit you, huh?

36:06.931 --> 36:08.762
You gonna die, Masa?

36:10.368 --> 36:13.269
Yeah, I guess you are.

36:14.438 --> 36:16.463
I have to keep living.

36:17.942 --> 36:19.204
My ear.

36:26.517 --> 36:27.779
Coffee!

36:47.171 --> 36:50.163
You think she's got one too?

36:50.708 --> 36:55.236
Do you think he meant to land on you?

36:56.247 --> 36:57.339
Beats me.

36:58.749 --> 37:02.014
Have you heard of the Suicide Club?

37:04.889 --> 37:06.618
Answer me, please.

37:09.060 --> 37:10.084
I don't know.

37:11.729 --> 37:12.627
I don't know.

37:14.165 --> 37:14.893
Okay.

37:17.368 --> 37:22.169
Did you know about the wound on his back?

37:24.942 --> 37:26.500
Do you have one too?

37:28.212 --> 37:28.803
No.

37:29.947 --> 37:34.816
Didn't you ask him why he
was missing skin there?

37:35.620 --> 37:36.985
No, creep.

37:37.622 --> 37:40.819
If your woman had a bent nose...

37:41.292 --> 37:44.989
...would you ask her why? Boar.

38:05.650 --> 38:06.912
Stay here.

38:14.859 --> 38:18.295
What do you think of Masa?

38:19.597 --> 38:20.757
Your boyfriend.

38:22.500 --> 38:26.834
You won't find anything.
He was just the type.

38:29.206 --> 38:31.003
Pisses me off.

38:34.345 --> 38:35.937
Let him die.

38:48.893 --> 38:51.225
Wait... hold up.

38:53.197 --> 38:58.362
If you think of anything else,
could you call this number?

39:27.064 --> 39:28.725
What was that about?

39:31.268 --> 39:31.996
Nothing.

39:36.540 --> 39:38.906
So what's the story?

39:39.477 --> 39:40.739
About what?

39:41.245 --> 39:42.212
Suicide Club.

39:42.279 --> 39:44.804
There's no such thing.

39:45.049 --> 39:48.177
I found a weird website. Wanna see it?

39:48.285 --> 39:50.185
I can't hear the TV.

39:51.622 --> 39:54.113
Such unappetizing talk.

40:02.500 --> 40:05.025
"Mail me. Hurry and drop me a line."

40:05.136 --> 40:06.535
Shut up!

40:07.538 --> 40:09.062
How old are they?

40:10.241 --> 40:12.410
Average is 14, I think.

40:12.410 --> 40:13.468
12 and a half.

40:14.278 --> 40:15.677
Younger than you.

40:15.880 --> 40:17.677
Sakura's immature.

40:17.915 --> 40:18.904
And you?

40:20.184 --> 40:20.946
Me too.

40:22.720 --> 40:24.585
I like the song actually.

40:56.287 --> 40:57.777
500 million.

41:00.124 --> 41:01.352
Don't blame me.

41:06.664 --> 41:10.225
Kiyoko, your dad's tired.

41:12.369 --> 41:16.305
Kiyoko, it's not my fault, you know.

41:20.845 --> 41:24.076
Good evening. I am The Bat.

41:24.381 --> 41:26.178
I've made it this far.

41:28.185 --> 41:32.849
I believe the source of
all the recent suicides...

41:33.090 --> 41:35.354
...lies somewhere on the Net.

41:36.293 --> 41:39.854
I've come here to find out if I'm right.

41:40.965 --> 41:44.992
I understand the meaning of the dots.

41:45.769 --> 41:48.397
So have I got it all right.

41:49.073 --> 41:51.007
It wasn't easy you know.

41:51.742 --> 41:55.769
If so, please respond. I'll be waiting.

41:56.881 --> 41:57.905
With love...

41:59.016 --> 42:04.886
To my dear Suicide Club.

42:07.558 --> 42:08.923
Watch this.

42:11.028 --> 42:12.723
Ruins. Com.

42:12.863 --> 42:15.161
Yeah, weird, huh?

42:15.399 --> 42:20.427
"Spread this message if you
want to halt the suicides"

42:20.571 --> 42:24.371
"Or more will die. We will all die."

42:25.910 --> 42:28.435
A friend showed it to me.

42:29.914 --> 42:31.711
Is there more?

42:32.716 --> 42:34.547
Nope, that's it.

42:36.987 --> 42:38.682
Gotta be a prank.

45:17.014 --> 45:18.311
Inspection done.

45:34.164 --> 45:35.631
Yes, I'm in!

45:36.133 --> 45:39.296
Dad! Dad! Dad!

45:40.738 --> 45:42.729
Dad, do we dare?

45:43.540 --> 45:45.531
Don't be silly. Move over.

45:49.113 --> 45:50.239
What is it?

45:51.648 --> 45:53.582
"Kuroda"

45:56.854 --> 45:58.446
What are you typing?

46:00.791 --> 46:03.351
Now we wait for a response.

46:14.571 --> 46:15.765
Yeah, hello?

46:17.141 --> 46:21.237
Is Mr. Kuroda there?

46:22.379 --> 46:26.975
Kuroda? He's gone home.

46:27.785 --> 46:32.882
He left early today. Can I help you?

46:34.424 --> 46:35.322
You are?

46:37.661 --> 46:38.650
You okay?

46:38.729 --> 46:39.753
Who are you?

46:41.498 --> 46:43.125
I'm Murata.

46:44.535 --> 46:47.368
When will Kuroda be in?

46:49.373 --> 46:54.675
Tomorrow morning. Who might you be?

46:55.946 --> 47:01.509
There is no Suicide
Club. Just tell him that.

47:02.886 --> 47:05.480
I'll call tomorrow at 8.

47:21.505 --> 47:23.473
Hello? Kuroda?

47:26.510 --> 47:27.678
We're ready.

47:27.678 --> 47:30.511
May 30

47:38.589 --> 47:39.521
You're on.

47:44.828 --> 47:45.817
Hello?

47:46.930 --> 47:48.295
Is this Mr. Kuroda?

47:49.800 --> 47:52.268
This is Kuroda. And you are?

47:53.337 --> 47:54.895
You taping this?

47:56.340 --> 47:56.863
Yes.

47:58.809 --> 48:00.674
Will it be on TV?

48:02.312 --> 48:06.874
That depends on whether you help us.

48:07.818 --> 48:10.116
Are you with a friend?

48:11.421 --> 48:13.582
There are others, yes.

48:14.691 --> 48:18.559
I see. These "others" are they big people?

48:19.830 --> 48:21.229
What do you mean?

48:22.399 --> 48:25.266
Are they adults?

48:26.403 --> 48:27.335
No.

48:28.839 --> 48:31.273
Then I can't promise any TV.

48:32.175 --> 48:33.540
Why not?

48:34.411 --> 48:36.140
Because you're not involved.

48:37.281 --> 48:40.079
Are you involved in yourself?

48:41.051 --> 48:43.076
What? Say again?

48:44.454 --> 48:46.251
I guess you don't understand.

48:49.726 --> 48:51.284
Are you involved?

48:53.130 --> 48:55.257
With what?

48:56.433 --> 48:58.196
The suicides.

49:00.003 --> 49:03.700
You obviously have no idea.

49:05.175 --> 49:11.341
Tonight at 7:30, on the same platform...

49:11.915 --> 49:14.884
...50 more will jump.

49:16.687 --> 49:21.784
Could be girls, could be kids.

49:23.493 --> 49:26.985
Here's a hint, the 6th chain.

49:32.669 --> 49:34.102
It's a prank.

49:34.705 --> 49:36.400
Do we stake it out?

49:37.507 --> 49:43.468
What do you propose we
watch? All males? All females?

49:45.615 --> 49:47.515
The 6th chain...

50:00.630 --> 50:05.329
1... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6

50:07.771 --> 50:12.333
This is no accident, got it?

50:14.144 --> 50:14.940
It's a crime.

50:33.764 --> 50:35.823
Ome-bound train now arriving.

50:37.100 --> 50:41.833
For your safety, please
stay behind the yellow line.

50:48.478 --> 50:50.708
You girls on your way home?

50:51.948 --> 50:53.643
Yes.

50:53.750 --> 50:55.274
Straight home?

51:09.566 --> 51:11.431
Going home?

51:11.501 --> 51:12.729
Yes, I am.

51:32.889 --> 51:33.856
Kuroda!

51:39.663 --> 51:42.564
Excuse me. Show me your tattoo.

51:42.666 --> 51:43.997
Fuck off.

51:44.301 --> 51:45.168
You got one?

51:45.168 --> 51:48.296
She doesn't, I've seen her naked.

51:48.438 --> 51:51.407
Shut up. Is this a pick up line?

52:13.363 --> 52:16.855
Hey, is that a real tattoo?

52:20.637 --> 52:24.869
You guys have tattoos? No?

52:25.709 --> 52:26.403
Thanks.

52:43.260 --> 52:46.286
You're sloshed, man.

53:27.103 --> 53:27.967
Shibu!

53:34.911 --> 53:36.139
Stop right there!

53:49.226 --> 53:50.921
Police!

54:41.311 --> 54:43.108
Nothing doing.

54:43.179 --> 54:46.114
Wait one more train.

54:46.583 --> 54:47.345
Right.

54:55.725 --> 54:57.590
Those cheap tattoos?

54:59.296 --> 55:01.355
Everyone's got 'em these days.

55:05.769 --> 55:11.207
Takao-bound express now
arriving on Track 10.

55:12.175 --> 55:16.703
For your safety, please
stay behind the yellow line.

55:17.380 --> 55:19.371
One and two...

55:23.820 --> 55:27.813
One and two and three...

55:39.235 --> 55:42.227
Please stand clear of the doors.

55:59.422 --> 56:01.287
That's enough. We're done.

56:32.489 --> 56:33.251
Look, more.

56:37.394 --> 56:40.557
Don't leave to tomorrow
what you can do today.

56:41.097 --> 56:43.793
Japan's too complacent.

56:44.467 --> 56:47.163
I used to shoplift.

56:47.270 --> 56:48.703
We're sinners.

56:49.339 --> 56:53.867
Yes, life is a sin! You just
cause trouble for others.

56:54.177 --> 56:57.943
Kill yourself before you murder someone.

56:58.114 --> 56:59.649
That's the spirit.

56:59.649 --> 57:00.741
Be a spirit.

57:07.991 --> 57:10.858
You order that again?

57:11.094 --> 57:16.361
Do me a favor. Try something
new for a change, will ya?

57:17.267 --> 57:19.599
This is gonna be heavenly.

57:22.705 --> 57:24.263
Delectable.

57:24.574 --> 57:25.802
What is that?

57:26.042 --> 57:28.169
I dunno. Something hot.

57:36.920 --> 57:40.287
Evening folks.

57:41.624 --> 57:46.196
Have you noticed how quickly
fads come and go these days?

57:46.196 --> 57:47.527
I have.

57:47.831 --> 57:49.196
Take cell phones...

57:55.038 --> 57:57.233
"Jump here"

58:09.652 --> 58:12.052
Yum, chocolate. All for me.

58:15.892 --> 58:21.524
Hey, not so fast! Give us some!

58:21.798 --> 58:24.596
We've got our own chocolate bar.

58:27.637 --> 58:29.298
What? You want some?

58:30.306 --> 58:32.501
Okay, go ask your mother.

58:32.709 --> 58:33.971
Mom!

58:44.187 --> 58:45.245
It's rising.

58:45.822 --> 58:47.653
Ropes, ladies.

58:50.627 --> 58:52.458
To the great beyond.

58:57.600 --> 59:01.297
Mom, can I get some chocolate?

59:02.238 --> 59:06.106
Sure, if you're a good girl.

59:12.415 --> 59:16.408
Come here. Dessert's on TV.

59:16.819 --> 59:18.548
Mom's funny.

59:41.544 --> 59:42.738
You hallucinate.

59:43.179 --> 59:45.170
Go kill yourself.

59:46.816 --> 59:48.477
Thank you very much.

59:52.522 --> 59:56.185
If a gentle melody rises to your ears...

59:56.993 --> 01:00:00.759
...stop the world revolving
and let music swell.

01:00:01.464 --> 01:00:05.457
Someday we shall meet again,
so wipe away those tears.

01:00:05.868 --> 01:00:09.531
Now it's time to bid you
all a pleasant farewell.

01:00:10.239 --> 01:00:14.266
Now it's time to bid you
all a pleasant farewell.

01:00:19.082 --> 01:00:24.179
Now it's time to say goodbye.
I hope you all are well.

01:00:27.123 --> 01:00:30.217
Everyone's acting funny these days.

01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:34.594
We want this song to cheer everybody up.

01:01:01.357 --> 01:01:02.688
I'm home.

01:01:15.338 --> 01:01:16.498
Welcome home, dad!

01:01:17.106 --> 01:01:20.200
I'm exhausted.

01:01:42.899 --> 01:01:45.367
Kiyomi! Toru!

01:01:53.743 --> 01:01:58.848
"Track 8: Jump here."

01:01:58.848 --> 01:02:02.750
Sakura? Sakura!

01:02:11.728 --> 01:02:12.752
"Look behind you!"

01:02:39.288 --> 01:02:41.813
Metropolitan Police Department

01:02:47.330 --> 01:02:51.232
So you thought this was
all a game, eh, Bat Girl?

01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:53.427
Reality's a lot simpler.

01:02:53.603 --> 01:02:54.661
You lose.

01:02:56.272 --> 01:02:57.364
Now type.

01:02:59.041 --> 01:03:00.531
Shut the fuck up.

01:03:02.311 --> 01:03:04.370
What do you want?

01:03:05.414 --> 01:03:09.316
Mail the cops. Tell them
you were kidnapped...

01:03:09.652 --> 01:03:12.746
...by the Suicide Club. You can type blind.

01:03:18.494 --> 01:03:20.758
"Help me!"

01:03:46.923 --> 01:03:48.788
Genesis, we're back.

01:04:10.847 --> 01:04:14.010
Welcome to the Suicide Club.

01:04:31.767 --> 01:04:34.668
You're guests of my pleasure room.

01:04:35.938 --> 01:04:40.568
Now Kiyoko, your glasses are crooked.

01:04:47.216 --> 01:04:50.083
Better? Can you see clearly now?

01:04:58.794 --> 01:05:03.731
Bad boy! Bad, bad boy!

01:05:09.405 --> 01:05:10.963
Sissy.

01:05:11.774 --> 01:05:13.674
My chair!

01:05:26.155 --> 01:05:27.122
Hammer.

01:05:33.195 --> 01:05:34.594
Son of a bitch.

01:05:38.935 --> 01:05:43.599
Kiyoko, what do you do in your
free time? You like home repair?

01:05:47.410 --> 01:05:50.379
I asked you a question!

01:05:53.149 --> 01:05:54.138
There.

01:05:57.553 --> 01:06:00.113
Welcome to my pleasure room.

01:06:01.524 --> 01:06:04.721
Let's entertain them.

01:06:36.092 --> 01:06:37.457
Shut up and listen!

01:06:39.128 --> 01:06:44.156
Time and time again the sky is blue.

01:06:44.300 --> 01:06:51.763
And yet it's strange how people
seem to always fall in love.

01:06:53.476 --> 01:06:57.378
An unfamiliar yellow dog...

01:06:57.446 --> 01:07:05.785
...keeps grinning as it tears
us from the ones we love.

01:07:06.522 --> 01:07:09.753
Because the dead...

01:07:10.326 --> 01:07:12.886
Because the dead...

01:07:13.929 --> 01:07:20.095
Because the dead shine all night long.

01:07:22.138 --> 01:07:28.976
I want to die as beautifully
as Joan of Arc...

01:07:29.045 --> 01:07:34.176
...inside a Bresson film.

01:07:36.385 --> 01:07:41.254
Lesson one, apply the shaving cream...

01:07:41.357 --> 01:07:48.024
...and smile as you then
slowly slice away the heart.

01:07:49.465 --> 01:07:52.229
Because the dead...

01:07:53.269 --> 01:07:55.430
Because the dead...

01:07:56.972 --> 01:08:03.036
Because the dead shine all night long.

01:08:05.114 --> 01:08:12.020
Feel the warmth of the spring rain as
it gently moistens down a cheek...

01:08:12.088 --> 01:08:17.754
...that's streaked with dried up tears.

01:08:19.562 --> 01:08:25.523
A guileless boy but five years old
stares blankly in the face of death...

01:08:25.667 --> 01:08:32.163
...while his heart is cut and torn away.

01:09:32.368 --> 01:09:33.232
Kuroda...

01:09:36.872 --> 01:09:40.433
The tattoo of the 6th chain.

01:09:49.551 --> 01:09:54.888
This isn't suicide. It's murder.

01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:09.697
Tell me. Which is murder, and which isn't?

01:10:14.276 --> 01:10:20.704
Is it murder starting today?
Or is this a special exception?

01:10:23.452 --> 01:10:25.886
It was murder from the start!

01:10:26.855 --> 01:10:28.083
It was.

01:10:29.058 --> 01:10:30.184
All of it.

01:10:32.628 --> 01:10:35.620
I'm so sorry.

01:10:39.235 --> 01:10:43.296
It's my fault. I was blind.

01:10:53.048 --> 01:10:53.946
Hello?

01:10:55.618 --> 01:10:56.448
Yes, okay.

01:10:58.554 --> 01:11:00.385
It's for you.

01:11:01.824 --> 01:11:02.756
Who is it?

01:11:03.626 --> 01:11:05.093
I think it's your son.

01:11:12.668 --> 01:11:18.004
Hello, Mr. Kuroda?

01:11:23.212 --> 01:11:24.110
Give it to him.

01:11:41.697 --> 01:11:42.755
Kuroda here.

01:11:43.532 --> 01:11:46.399
Kuroda, hold on.

01:11:50.272 --> 01:11:51.102
Hello?

01:11:55.110 --> 01:11:56.338
Why'd you do it?

01:11:57.946 --> 01:11:59.004
I didn't.

01:12:01.784 --> 01:12:02.716
Why?

01:12:04.653 --> 01:12:07.383
What's your connection to you?

01:12:09.825 --> 01:12:10.587
What?

01:12:12.194 --> 01:12:13.218
Good bye.

01:12:14.263 --> 01:12:15.890
Wait!

01:12:19.168 --> 01:12:25.630
Do you understand? I
understand our connection.

01:12:27.409 --> 01:12:31.573
I understand your connection to your wife.

01:12:33.482 --> 01:12:37.248
I understand your
connection to your children.

01:12:39.088 --> 01:12:42.421
But as for your connection to yourself...

01:12:44.059 --> 01:12:48.860
If you die, will you lose the
connection with yourself?

01:12:50.933 --> 01:12:57.236
Even if you die, your connection
with your wife will remain.

01:12:58.841 --> 01:13:02.971
So will your connection with your children.

01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:10.876
But if you die, will you lose
your connection with yourself?

01:13:12.488 --> 01:13:18.654
Will you live on? Are you
connected to yourself?

01:13:26.602 --> 01:13:32.768
Why couldn't you feel the pain
of others as you would your own?

01:13:32.841 --> 01:13:39.713
Why couldn't you bear the pain
of others as you would your own?

01:13:40.682 --> 01:13:43.207
You are the criminal.

01:13:43.585 --> 01:13:47.988
You could only think of
yourself. You're scum.

01:13:48.690 --> 01:13:49.588
Scum!

01:13:58.167 --> 01:13:59.259
Kuroda!

01:14:02.871 --> 01:14:05.806
Investigate all suicides up until now.

01:14:06.108 --> 01:14:07.939
That's an order!

01:14:09.778 --> 01:14:10.870
Kuroda!

01:14:22.691 --> 01:14:23.817
It's no use.

01:14:25.828 --> 01:14:26.852
It's no use.

01:14:29.398 --> 01:14:30.831
They're not the enemy.

01:14:32.901 --> 01:14:33.595
Kuroda!

01:14:42.144 --> 01:14:43.236
This is crazy.

01:14:44.947 --> 01:14:46.005
Really crazy.

01:14:46.548 --> 01:14:48.038
What does it mean?

01:14:51.854 --> 01:14:52.946
Overtime.

01:15:02.898 --> 01:15:03.626
Shibu!

01:15:05.033 --> 01:15:05.692
What is it?

01:15:06.802 --> 01:15:09.396
Get the providers and all links.

01:15:12.474 --> 01:15:14.510
You leaving school man?

01:15:14.510 --> 01:15:17.240
I blew my finals, so yeah.

01:15:18.046 --> 01:15:19.604
Finish high school at least.

01:15:20.582 --> 01:15:21.884
Why? You didn't.

01:15:21.884 --> 01:15:22.407
True.

01:15:28.290 --> 01:15:29.723
I'm starving.

01:15:29.925 --> 01:15:32.587
I could go for some red meat.

01:15:32.761 --> 01:15:34.956
After a kill, make it rare.

01:16:39.928 --> 01:16:43.131
"It's the Bat. Get me out of here!"

01:16:43.131 --> 01:16:43.654
Memo.

01:16:44.866 --> 01:16:45.730
Here.

01:16:51.673 --> 01:16:52.662
Let's go.

01:17:03.552 --> 01:17:04.610
What are you doing?

01:17:06.388 --> 01:17:08.288
Move aside.

01:17:09.658 --> 01:17:13.890
Go ahead, Kiyoko. Type away.

01:17:18.266 --> 01:17:24.364
"From what I can tell, I'm in a
dimly-lit basement of some kind."

01:17:25.374 --> 01:17:30.471
That won't do. Tell them our address.

01:17:33.582 --> 01:17:38.110
Go ahead. We need to stir
up some excitement anyway.

01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:43.657
Now's the perfect time to
get caught. Right? Right?

01:17:44.292 --> 01:17:48.092
This is where my name
gets etched in history.

01:17:49.097 --> 01:17:50.962
Here, let me do that.

01:17:51.333 --> 01:17:53.893
Entertain her, will you?

01:17:57.372 --> 01:18:02.639
Hi, there. My name's Genesis.

01:18:03.245 --> 01:18:10.686
I've had delusions of
grandeur since I was a child.

01:18:10.686 --> 01:18:13.348
May 31

01:18:13.622 --> 01:18:15.852
Just after 7 this morning...

01:18:16.324 --> 01:18:20.124
...the police arrested a group
calling itself The Suicide Club...

01:18:20.262 --> 01:18:24.995
...and claiming responsibility
for multiple murders.

01:18:25.267 --> 01:18:30.534
The group used the Internet to
call upon people to kill themselves.

01:18:30.639 --> 01:18:34.541
Their proclaimed aim was social upheaval.

01:18:34.776 --> 01:18:38.303
Investigators are now working
to uncover the details.

01:18:40.515 --> 01:18:43.609
Stand back please, move aside.

01:18:44.086 --> 01:18:47.817
Am I on camera? Good, good, good.

01:18:49.291 --> 01:18:53.523
First I'd like to say reality
is invisible to the naked eye.

01:18:53.662 --> 01:18:57.621
You and me both know
that life is a real bitch.

01:18:57.833 --> 01:19:02.702
Bring your best you say?
That's not good enough.

01:19:02.871 --> 01:19:07.535
It's like that Dessert
song. How's that go again?

01:19:08.043 --> 01:19:13.003
"The world is a jigsaw puzzle."

01:19:13.148 --> 01:19:16.140
Somewhere there's a fit for you.

01:19:18.887 --> 01:19:20.821
Has to fit.

01:19:44.446 --> 01:19:50.351
The world is a jigsaw puzzle.

01:19:50.519 --> 01:19:56.253
The world is a jigsaw puzzle.

01:19:56.658 --> 01:20:00.822
Somewhere there 's a fit for you.

01:20:02.330 --> 01:20:08.132
A place where your puzzle piece belongs.

01:20:08.603 --> 01:20:13.063
Don 't fit you say? Then make it so.

01:20:14.910 --> 01:20:16.969
There 's nowhere for my piece to go.

01:20:17.612 --> 01:20:23.107
Find a match that lasts forever.

01:20:23.385 --> 01:20:28.914
Perhaps I better say so long.

01:20:35.630 --> 01:20:38.827
I'm the Charlie Manson
of the Information Age!

01:20:39.234 --> 01:20:47.141
"Find a match that lasts forever."

01:20:47.943 --> 01:20:53.074
"Perhaps I'd better say so long."

01:21:38.760 --> 01:21:41.285
It's open.

01:21:46.201 --> 01:21:47.293
Mitsuko.

01:21:47.736 --> 01:21:49.431
I've come to return this.

01:22:07.555 --> 01:22:09.750
June 1

01:23:41.850 --> 01:23:43.078
Mail me...

01:24:16.051 --> 01:24:17.951
No. 8, two fingers.

01:24:22.724 --> 01:24:24.885
No. 4, three fingers.

01:24:27.495 --> 01:24:29.554
No. 2, three fingers.

01:24:32.801 --> 01:24:34.894
No. 4, three fingers.

01:24:38.106 --> 01:24:40.438
No. 3, one finger.

01:24:42.544 --> 01:24:44.375
No. 3, two fingers.

01:24:46.581 --> 01:24:47.548
Suicide.

01:24:53.922 --> 01:24:55.890
Please enter your PIN number.

01:25:13.541 --> 01:25:14.473
Got it?

01:25:16.311 --> 01:25:16.936
Who is this?

01:25:18.346 --> 01:25:21.975
There is no Suicide Club you know.

01:25:22.951 --> 01:25:24.009
But come on over.

01:26:07.028 --> 01:26:08.120
Hello.

01:26:09.964 --> 01:26:10.828
Hey Shibu...

01:26:11.533 --> 01:26:15.594
...just got word that 200 girls
jumped from Osaka Castle.

01:26:16.838 --> 01:26:18.772
I wonder if we got the right guy.

01:26:20.975 --> 01:26:23.637
How did he get them to do it?

01:26:53.374 --> 01:26:54.966
"Dessert concert tomorrow."

01:26:57.178 --> 01:26:59.669
June 2

01:28:17.158 --> 01:28:19.319
Even if you were to die...

01:28:19.494 --> 01:28:23.794
...your connection to your
boyfriend would remain.

01:28:23.898 --> 01:28:30.428
Even if you were to die, your
link to the world would remain.

01:28:30.505 --> 01:28:33.668
So why are you living?

01:29:41.843 --> 01:29:43.435
Why did you come?

01:29:43.711 --> 01:29:48.478
Did you come to repair your
connection with yourself?

01:29:48.816 --> 01:29:52.377
Or did you come to sever that connection?

01:29:52.720 --> 01:29:56.121
Are you now severed from yourself?

01:29:57.425 --> 01:30:00.622
I am I. And I'm connected to myself.

01:30:08.503 --> 01:30:10.835
Are you related to you?

01:30:11.639 --> 01:30:16.542
Like between you and me,
victim and assailant...

01:30:17.378 --> 01:30:23.510
...you and your boyfriend.
Can you relate to yourself?

01:30:24.385 --> 01:30:27.081
Are you related to yourself?

01:30:27.989 --> 01:30:30.787
Are you sought by yourself?

01:30:31.592 --> 01:30:33.389
When rain dries, clouds form.

01:30:33.728 --> 01:30:37.186
When rain dries, clouds form.

01:30:37.732 --> 01:30:40.997
When clouds moisten, rain forms.

01:31:09.197 --> 01:31:10.357
It's ready.

01:33:43.517 --> 01:33:49.251
Tokyo-bound express
now arriving on Track 8.

01:33:50.458 --> 01:33:54.690
For your safety, please
stay behind the yellow line.

01:35:14.141 --> 01:35:19.340
This is Dessert's final performance.
Thanks for all your support.

01:35:19.747 --> 01:35:23.183
Our last message to you is...

01:35:24.652 --> 01:35:26.347
Live as you please!

01:35:32.426 --> 01:35:39.730
Little did we know how
little do we really know.

01:35:40.167 --> 01:35:44.661
Everyday we 're pressing the keys...

01:35:45.573 --> 01:35:53.480
...that execute a million commands.

01:35:53.814 --> 01:36:00.617
If only you would say exactly
what is on your mind...

01:36:01.522 --> 01:36:06.357
...and tell me how you really feel.

01:36:09.730 --> 01:36:13.757
Maybe I can lend a helping hand.

01:36:17.938 --> 01:36:22.875
Scary it's true, but loads of fun too.

01:36:23.110 --> 01:36:28.173
To open up and feel the brand of life...

01:36:30.851 --> 01:36:35.584
...for each and everyone.

01:36:36.524 --> 01:36:41.223
Light yourself with life.

01:36:41.896 --> 01:36:46.526
Light yourself with love.

01:36:47.134 --> 01:36:51.628
Light yourself with memories.

01:36:51.839 --> 01:36:59.507
All it takes is just a little
heart and courage on your part.

01:37:08.622 --> 01:37:15.255
Turn yourself around and take
it once again from the start.

01:37:16.297 --> 01:37:20.256
Though you may feel out
of touch at times...

01:37:24.305 --> 01:37:29.538
...or fear a wicked spell
has got your life in hand.

01:37:29.610 --> 01:37:36.709
If by some chance, you share the
feelings that I have for you...

01:37:37.384 --> 01:37:42.219
...come occupy the chasm of my heart.

01:37:45.726 --> 01:37:50.629
Together we can shed light on the dark.

01:37:53.968 --> 01:37:58.667
Scary, it's true. But we 'll be happy too.

01:37:59.106 --> 01:38:03.736
Now do you really want to say good bye...

01:38:07.014 --> 01:38:11.974
...and leave me high and dry.

01:38:12.553 --> 01:38:17.115
Light yourself with life.

01:38:17.791 --> 01:38:22.125
Light yourself with love.

01:38:23.364 --> 01:38:27.630
Light yourself with memories.

01:38:27.902 --> 01:38:36.435
As we go, we 'll forget the
pain. We 'll find life again.
