'So I can't catch up on the DVR.'

00:21.070 --> 00:23.036
'It just doesn't matter how hard I try.'

00:23.038 --> 00:25.472
'And I don't have the time
to try. That's the problem.'

00:25.474 --> 00:28.508
'You need to take a day
off, take a little TV vacay.'

00:28.510 --> 00:30.344
- 'A TV vacay?'
- 'Yeah.'

00:30.346 --> 00:32.011
'So I'm supposed to
take a day off from work'

00:32.012 --> 00:34.547
'so I can catch up on all
the programs on my DVR?'

00:34.549 --> 00:37.616
'Turn your phone off, relax and catch up.'

00:37.618 --> 00:39.820
'Okay, first of all, turning
the phone off is not an option.'

00:39.822 --> 00:42.689
'Second of all, relaxing is for pussies.'

00:42.691 --> 00:44.657
'Do I look like a pussy to you?'

00:44.659 --> 00:46.559
'Well, pussies are caught
up on "The Hard Life."'

00:46.561 --> 00:48.762
'Yeah, I-I can't watch that show.'

00:48.764 --> 00:49.963
'I just can't do it.'

00:49.965 --> 00:51.364
'It's the best show on TV'

00:51.366 --> 00:52.866
'and you just stopped watchin'?'

00:52.868 --> 00:56.436
Yeah, because I felt like I
was being told I had to watch.

00:56.438 --> 01:00.540
Don't tell me I have to watch.
Just let me watch. I'm smart.

01:00.542 --> 01:02.074
Look, I'm a writer/musician.

01:02.076 --> 01:03.744
So I know when things are good or bad.

01:03.746 --> 01:05.645
You do. You have an aesthetic.

01:05.647 --> 01:07.047
'And "The Hard Life" is a good show'

01:07.049 --> 01:08.615
but there are bad things about it.

01:08.617 --> 01:10.484
Well, there's bad things about everything

01:10.486 --> 01:11.651
if you look hard enough.

01:11.653 --> 01:13.119
It's what I do as a producer.

01:13.121 --> 01:16.455
Exactly. The castin' on
that show is horrendous.

01:16.457 --> 01:18.425
I mean, castin' a mentally disabled person

01:18.427 --> 01:20.927
'to basically play
himself? It's exploitation.'

01:20.929 --> 01:22.395
I'm sorry, which one's retarded?

01:22.397 --> 01:23.930
'Smash, the big, ugly guy'

01:23.932 --> 01:25.499
who smashes beer cans on his forehead.

01:25.501 --> 01:27.032
I love when the guy does that.

01:27.034 --> 01:30.737
I literally laugh out
loud. And I don't laugh.

01:30.739 --> 01:32.505
But, come on, it's so over the top.

01:32.507 --> 01:34.808
Even if he's retarded,
nobody's that retarded.

01:34.810 --> 01:37.112
You should talk to my agent.

01:39.046 --> 01:41.748
- You textin' your boyfriend?
- Yeah.

01:41.750 --> 01:43.984
Just telling him I wish he existed.

01:43.986 --> 01:45.050
Oh!

01:46.421 --> 01:48.154
That's funny.

01:48.156 --> 01:50.056
Have I seen you at an audition before?

01:50.058 --> 01:51.892
- Um..
- I think I have. I have.

01:51.894 --> 01:54.094
- The-the popcorn commercial.
- Yeah.

01:54.096 --> 01:56.695
That one was so weird with
the puppets and everything.

01:56.697 --> 01:59.433
They were so creepy, right?
Did you get called back on that?

01:59.435 --> 02:01.201
Yeah, but I didn't book it.

02:01.203 --> 02:03.603
You should have. You are so freakin' hot.

02:03.605 --> 02:05.704
I mean, I saw you when you
walked in. You're delicious.

02:05.706 --> 02:08.107
Oh, thank you.

02:08.109 --> 02:09.877
You're so perceptive.

02:15.683 --> 02:18.885
- Are you alright?
- Yeah.

02:18.887 --> 02:21.655
Because you look terrible.

02:21.657 --> 02:23.222
E-excuse me?

02:23.224 --> 02:25.792
Uh, well, like you've been cryin'.

02:25.794 --> 02:29.029
Are you okay? Did-did,
did someone hurt you?

02:29.031 --> 02:31.734
No. I'm fine.

02:32.867 --> 02:35.768
I-I just got off work.

02:35.770 --> 02:37.169
I look terrible?

02:37.171 --> 02:39.905
Yes, you look terrible.

02:39.907 --> 02:43.008
Look, dear, if you need someone to talk to

02:43.010 --> 02:46.645
my name is Margaret. I'm here with friends.

02:46.647 --> 02:49.418
- Okay.
- Don't hesitate.

02:55.824 --> 02:57.093
I look fine.

02:58.926 --> 03:02.596
Yo, yo, yo, you-you
can't park this here, man.

03:02.598 --> 03:04.130
Why?

03:04.132 --> 03:07.167
Because this is for people
going to that restaurant.

03:07.169 --> 03:09.502
Yeah, I'm having dinner.

03:09.504 --> 03:12.172
- At-at this place?
- Yes.

03:12.174 --> 03:14.975
Okay.

03:14.977 --> 03:16.576
What the fuck happened to your car, man?

03:16.578 --> 03:17.776
What do you mean?

03:17.778 --> 03:18.945
I mean, did you get into an accident

03:18.947 --> 03:20.179
on your way here or what?

03:20.181 --> 03:22.749
No, it's just old, you know, city driving.

03:22.751 --> 03:24.618
Oh, sure, you know, 'cause, I mean

03:24.620 --> 03:26.185
it looks like you drove it
through a fuckin' sandstorm.

03:26.187 --> 03:28.922
Wash your car, man.

03:28.924 --> 03:30.590
Seriously.

03:30.592 --> 03:32.559
I mean, if-if you don't
respect what you drive

03:32.561 --> 03:34.730
you don't respect yourself.

03:38.066 --> 03:39.698
- Yeah.
- I-I-I, you know..

03:39.700 --> 03:41.567
I-I never get called back for anything

03:41.569 --> 03:42.735
but I'm takin' classes, you know

03:42.737 --> 03:44.270
just kind of workin' on my craft

03:44.272 --> 03:46.540
and hopefully I find
my voice here, you know?

03:46.542 --> 03:48.007
- I'm sure you will.
- Yeah, yeah.

03:48.009 --> 03:49.842
In the meantime, I'm trainin'
to be a personal trainer.

03:49.844 --> 03:51.043
I'm trainin' to train.

03:51.045 --> 03:52.245
That's what I like to say, right?

03:52.247 --> 03:53.846
I should put that on a T-shirt, right?

03:53.848 --> 03:56.750
I mean, that, that is, that is funny stuff.

03:57.885 --> 03:59.953
Oh, okay.

03:59.955 --> 04:01.321
Well, alright, alright.

04:01.323 --> 04:03.256
You guys are officially the hottest chicks

04:03.258 --> 04:04.858
in this place.

04:04.860 --> 04:06.059
What the fuck are you talking about?

04:06.061 --> 04:07.827
Amy, stop. He's just being sweet.

04:07.829 --> 04:09.863
Sweet? Okay.

04:09.865 --> 04:11.565
Sweet. You girls want a piece of cake?

04:11.567 --> 04:14.233
Two. Now, leave.

04:14.235 --> 04:16.870
I'm Syd, by the way.

04:16.872 --> 04:18.904
My name's Dean.

04:18.906 --> 04:20.209
Like James.

04:21.709 --> 04:24.678
- Jesus Christ!
- I think he's so cute.

04:24.680 --> 04:26.178
- He's a waiter.
- So?

04:26.180 --> 04:28.582
Maybe he's in a place right now
where this is what he has to do.

04:28.584 --> 04:29.983
- He's a waiter.
- So..

04:29.985 --> 04:31.284
Who are we to judge other people?

04:31.286 --> 04:33.887
Syd, he's a waiter.

04:33.889 --> 04:35.921
Amy, I'm a waiter.

04:35.923 --> 04:38.291
So it doesn't mean you have to date one.

04:38.293 --> 04:40.860
You're right.

04:40.862 --> 04:41.898
Yeah.

04:43.197 --> 04:44.897
Smash?

04:44.899 --> 04:48.702
Hey, you're Smash, right,
from "The Hard Life?"

04:48.704 --> 04:51.070
Yeah, yeah. Uh, uh,
actually my name is Matt.

04:51.072 --> 04:54.039
Oh, Smash. You are hilarious, man!

04:54.041 --> 04:55.642
I wish you had a beer can right now.

04:55.644 --> 04:57.676
You know what I mean? So you can..

04:57.678 --> 04:59.178
You know, right? You know what I mean?

04:59.180 --> 05:00.212
Yeah, a beer can..

05:02.184 --> 05:03.849
You should carry one around with you, man.

05:03.851 --> 05:05.317
I am serious, so-so you can do

05:05.319 --> 05:06.752
you know, what you do on the show.

05:06.754 --> 05:10.123
You know, uh, you get the TV.. Smash!

05:10.125 --> 05:12.058
Right? Smash!

05:12.060 --> 05:15.295
- I love that shit.
- Yeah.

05:15.297 --> 05:18.163
Oh, man, I wish I get
paid to do shit like that.

05:18.165 --> 05:20.265
I, I really do. Hey, hey, how do you..

05:20.267 --> 05:22.334
How do you get on TV?

05:22.336 --> 05:24.937
Uh, uh, you know, if you
can just give me a little jam

05:24.939 --> 05:26.305
a little token, a little, little tip

05:26.307 --> 05:28.875
that'd be just much appreciated.

05:28.877 --> 05:32.745
You know, I'm meetin' a friend
here for dinner, so, uh..

05:32.747 --> 05:35.117
Wow, so you're not a handy person?

05:36.651 --> 05:38.721
No, no, I-I-I'm
an actor.

05:42.057 --> 05:44.225
So I guess there's somethin'
wrong with me, right?

05:48.863 --> 05:50.298
I was just jokin'.

05:54.036 --> 05:55.737
I'd like to photograph you.

05:57.406 --> 06:00.339
Please, just park my car. Okay, please?

06:00.341 --> 06:02.442
- How much you gonna tip me?
- What?

06:02.444 --> 06:04.377
Oh, I'm, I'm sorry.

06:04.379 --> 06:07.346
Do you have enough cash

06:07.348 --> 06:09.716
to give me a tip?

06:09.718 --> 06:10.750
Yes, I have plenty...

06:10.752 --> 06:11.985
'Cause you know, if you don't

06:11.987 --> 06:14.019
there's a machine right around the corner.

06:14.021 --> 06:15.988
I have cash. I have cash.

06:15.990 --> 06:18.860
Everyone says that, but people are liars.

06:20.295 --> 06:21.695
Here's a thought.

06:21.697 --> 06:23.062
Maybe people don't tip you

06:23.064 --> 06:25.197
because you're not a nice person.

06:25.199 --> 06:27.399
Y-you are nice?

06:27.401 --> 06:28.637
Move to fuckin' Nebraska.

06:30.939 --> 06:32.372
It's all about bein' seen.

06:32.374 --> 06:34.173
Go to more clubs and openings.

06:34.175 --> 06:35.341
- Do you have a publicist?
- No.

06:35.343 --> 06:38.110
I haven't actually done anything.

06:38.112 --> 06:39.245
Well, that doesn't matter.

06:39.247 --> 06:42.014
When you're good-looking as you are

06:42.016 --> 06:43.882
you don't have to have done anything.

06:43.884 --> 06:45.418
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah.

06:45.420 --> 06:47.486
The good-looking people can
be plugged into anything.

06:47.488 --> 06:50.389
It's the very specific and odd types

06:50.391 --> 06:53.793
that actually have to have talent.

06:53.795 --> 06:55.765
And even that's not always the case.

06:58.065 --> 07:01.034
Oh! Hey, Dave, you're late.

07:01.036 --> 07:04.036
I know, I know. I'm sorry,
okay? I had to work late.

07:04.038 --> 07:05.938
Hey, well, now that your buddy is here

07:05.940 --> 07:07.906
I'll let you guys get to it.

07:07.908 --> 07:10.142
Yeah, it was nice to meet you.

07:10.144 --> 07:12.144
Hey, nice to meet you, too, bro.

07:12.146 --> 07:14.413
Big fan, big fan!

07:14.415 --> 07:15.914
Thanks.

07:15.916 --> 07:17.449
Enjoy the rest of your dinner.

07:17.451 --> 07:20.853
Oh, right, sorry. Didn't mean to intrude.

07:20.855 --> 07:24.057
We'll be over here with
the non-television actors.

07:26.228 --> 07:27.396
Okay.

07:29.430 --> 07:31.901
I'll just give you a few
minutes to look over the menu.

07:34.269 --> 07:35.834
I mean, just 'cause a
guy's hot doesn't mean

07:35.836 --> 07:37.170
you need to waste your time with him.

07:37.172 --> 07:38.370
Okay, but I just can't follow

07:38.372 --> 07:39.906
the rules like you, okay?

07:39.908 --> 07:41.473
I have to follow my heart.

07:41.475 --> 07:44.010
Well, your heart's stupid.

07:44.012 --> 07:46.880
- My heart is not stupid.
- Hm.

07:46.882 --> 07:48.481
Okay, remember Tito?

07:48.483 --> 07:50.916
The club promoter who took
you to the Dominican Republic

07:50.918 --> 07:52.185
and then left you there?

07:52.187 --> 07:53.452
Okay, I had an adventure

07:53.454 --> 07:55.555
and I learned a lot of Spanish.

07:55.557 --> 07:57.824
What about Dan, the snowboarder

07:57.826 --> 08:00.159
who had sex with your
sister at the X Games?

08:00.161 --> 08:01.360
Well, they fell in love and, you know..

08:01.362 --> 08:03.930
That baby is so cute.

08:03.932 --> 08:05.832
Or the guy who gave you lice

08:05.834 --> 08:08.334
and then took a dump in your shower..

08:08.336 --> 08:10.370
- What was his name again?
- Domingo.

08:10.372 --> 08:12.070
Yeah, fuck that guy.
That guy was an asshole.

08:12.072 --> 08:14.473
Asshole? Then why'd you date him?

08:14.475 --> 08:16.276
Fine, you know what,
you're so quick to judge

08:16.278 --> 08:18.577
my awful choices, but what about yours?

08:18.579 --> 08:21.180
I don't make awful choices. I'm perfect.

08:21.182 --> 08:22.414
This is what happens when you're late.

08:22.416 --> 08:23.916
I'm sorry.

08:23.918 --> 08:25.218
Because of you, I just got torn apart

08:25.220 --> 08:26.252
by Jerry Fuck-heimer.

08:26.254 --> 08:27.820
I'm really sorry.

08:27.822 --> 08:29.522
It's alright. I just hate everyone.

08:29.524 --> 08:31.524
I know. You say it all the time.

08:31.526 --> 08:34.025
Huh, I do, don't I?

08:34.028 --> 08:36.195
So, ladies?

08:36.197 --> 08:38.498
We're talking. Just walk away.

08:38.500 --> 08:40.400
But I-I, I thought we had a like a...

08:40.402 --> 08:42.900
Look, we're lesbians.

08:42.903 --> 08:45.470
- That's even better.
- It's not happening.

08:45.472 --> 08:48.777
Just walk away, you himbo, walk away.

08:51.413 --> 08:53.613
Uh.. Okay, yeah.

08:53.615 --> 08:55.547
- You are so mean.
- Thank you.

08:55.549 --> 08:57.182
You know, you've been here
for, like, ten seconds?

08:57.184 --> 08:59.518
Are people born evil or
does society turn them

08:59.520 --> 09:01.954
into monsters, demons, devils?

09:01.956 --> 09:04.257
- What's this guy's name again?
- Darren.

09:04.259 --> 09:06.291
You realize how cliche
it is to hate your boss?

09:06.293 --> 09:08.427
But he's so hate-able.

09:08.429 --> 09:09.896
Just 'cause he went to Dartmouth

09:09.898 --> 09:12.031
he thinks his dick is
made of whipped cream.

09:12.033 --> 09:13.366
What does that mean?

09:13.368 --> 09:15.568
- It's an Ivy League thing.
- Okay.

09:15.570 --> 09:17.436
He just made me rewrite my episode

09:17.438 --> 09:19.906
for the fifth time.

09:19.908 --> 09:21.608
We're the lowest-rated
cartoon on basic cable

09:21.610 --> 09:23.575
and he thinks he's Aaron Sorkin.

09:23.577 --> 09:25.511
- How old is he again?
- Twenty five.

09:25.513 --> 09:27.146
Yeah, fuck that guy.

09:27.148 --> 09:29.616
I am killing myself for a show

09:29.618 --> 09:32.421
that barely entertains
six-year-olds.

09:34.556 --> 09:38.023
Well, at least you're not retarded.

09:38.025 --> 09:40.158
See, this is your problem,
you never leave your house.

09:40.160 --> 09:41.927
So you don't know how
to talk to real people.

09:41.929 --> 09:43.629
Okay, I will have you
know that I am considered

09:43.631 --> 09:45.297
the coolest person in my office.

09:45.299 --> 09:46.999
Okay.

09:47.001 --> 09:48.468
Are you listening to yourself?

09:48.470 --> 09:50.538
'Cause that's the saddest
thing I've ever heard.

09:52.240 --> 09:55.208
Yeah, that really was pretty
pathetic. Fine. Okay, fine.

09:55.210 --> 09:58.143
Then what-what am I
supposed to do about it?

09:58.145 --> 10:01.046
- We're going out... to a bar.
- No!

10:01.048 --> 10:03.516
Matt, you promised me. I need this.

10:03.518 --> 10:04.550
You need what?

10:04.552 --> 10:06.419
I need to drink some drinks

10:06.421 --> 10:07.954
and talk to some ladies.

10:07.956 --> 10:10.455
Dave, you're not gonna talk to anyone.

10:10.457 --> 10:12.190
No, but you are

10:12.192 --> 10:14.661
and then I'm gonna slide
into the conversation.

10:14.663 --> 10:16.628
Look, talkin' to women in the city

10:16.630 --> 10:18.297
is not that interesting.

10:18.299 --> 10:21.501
That may be true, but what if

10:21.503 --> 10:24.671
what if there are
interesting people out there?

10:24.673 --> 10:26.940
Fascinating, intelligent,
diamonds in the rough

10:26.942 --> 10:28.241
and we just haven't met them yet.

10:28.243 --> 10:30.443
Alright, keep it in
your pants, John Hughes.

10:30.445 --> 10:32.045
No, no, no. I am not going to a bar...

10:32.047 --> 10:33.646
- Amy.
- Syd.

10:33.648 --> 10:37.249
I am your friend. Let me help you.

10:37.251 --> 10:38.920
We're going to a bar.

10:40.154 --> 10:44.589
Fine, but I will not have fun.

10:44.591 --> 10:47.026
Fine. How about this?

10:47.028 --> 10:50.463
You, my friend, have a morbid
and perverse sense of humor.

10:50.465 --> 10:51.998
Now you're speakin' my language...

10:52.000 --> 10:54.334
So perverse that you genuinely enjoy

10:54.336 --> 10:57.203
watching human beings
unravel before your very eyes.

10:57.205 --> 10:58.503
Of course. Who doesn't?

10:58.505 --> 11:02.074
I have had a very long week

11:02.076 --> 11:05.511
and I guarantee that this
will be one of those nights

11:05.513 --> 11:08.414
where I completely fall apart.

11:08.416 --> 11:10.550
Now, that sounds great.

11:10.552 --> 11:12.218
Where are we goin'?

11:14.000 --> 11:20.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:27.634 --> 11:30.939
- Excuse me!
- This guy's unbelievable.

11:34.341 --> 11:35.742
Hey, two vodka cranberries, please.

11:35.744 --> 11:37.576
Uh, can I get a white wine instead?

11:37.578 --> 11:39.579
Wait. Wine? What, are you divorced?

11:39.581 --> 11:42.515
Look at this place. The wine's
probably been open for months.

11:42.517 --> 11:45.084
Fine. Can I have a vodka cranberry?

11:45.086 --> 11:47.320
And I'll just say that I have
a urinary-tract infection.

11:47.322 --> 11:49.155
Uh, okay.

11:49.157 --> 11:51.491
I wish I was a pretty girl.

11:51.493 --> 11:53.258
Excuse me?

11:53.260 --> 11:55.127
I wish I could just walk
up to the bar and order

11:55.129 --> 11:57.195
no matter who else was standing there.

11:57.197 --> 11:58.230
What are you saying?

11:58.232 --> 12:00.098
I think we cut in front on them.

12:00.100 --> 12:01.767
Well, there's a natural order
to things. We're in a bar.

12:01.769 --> 12:03.703
You guys should know it's ladies first.

12:03.705 --> 12:05.504
Maybe that's why you're alone right now.

12:05.506 --> 12:07.241
Later, dudes.

12:09.110 --> 12:10.276
Well, alright..

12:10.278 --> 12:12.145
Uh, those girls are such bitches.

12:12.147 --> 12:15.314
- Which is very attractive.
- I guess.

12:15.316 --> 12:17.215
Did that girl look familiar to you?

12:17.217 --> 12:18.483
The one that looks like she's been cryin'?

12:18.485 --> 12:20.118
No, no, no. The other one.

12:20.120 --> 12:21.286
Never seen her before in my life.

12:21.288 --> 12:23.823
I feel like I know her from somewhere.

12:23.825 --> 12:26.825
- You want me to go ask her?
- No, no, absolutely not.

12:26.827 --> 12:29.728
They were very attractive,
but had negative attitudes.

12:29.730 --> 12:32.732
There's too much uncertainty
there to make the first move.

12:32.734 --> 12:34.666
You're a dork.

12:34.668 --> 12:36.569
Yeah, that's about right.

12:36.571 --> 12:38.403
Hey, buddy!

12:38.405 --> 12:40.742
- No, there's no one here.
- Hey!

12:42.644 --> 12:43.810
But..

12:45.212 --> 12:48.116
I wish I had a hook!

12:49.484 --> 12:52.517
- I don't know about you, uh..
- Amy.

12:52.519 --> 12:54.087
I don't know about you, Amy

12:54.089 --> 12:57.156
but I've gotten really
into cheese this summer.

12:57.158 --> 12:58.491
Oh, wow!

12:58.493 --> 12:59.758
I don't know if you know this

12:59.760 --> 13:01.694
but there are more types of cheese

13:01.696 --> 13:02.862
than there are types of wines.

13:02.864 --> 13:04.530
Yeah, like, 20 times more.

13:04.532 --> 13:06.199
That's interesting.

13:06.201 --> 13:07.767
I mean, when I drink wine, I like to have

13:07.769 --> 13:09.669
a couple of different
cheeses to choose from.

13:09.671 --> 13:11.403
Uh..

13:11.405 --> 13:14.739
- Cheese.
- What?

13:14.741 --> 13:18.210
You don't pluralize cheese.
It's improper to say cheeses.

13:18.212 --> 13:21.147
- Thank you.
- That's not true.

13:21.149 --> 13:23.348
I think he knows what he's talking about.

13:23.350 --> 13:27.152
He dated a girl who worked
at Cheese And Thank You.

13:27.154 --> 13:28.521
He dated a girl?

13:28.523 --> 13:30.355
Wait, but what about when you're at a party

13:30.357 --> 13:33.225
and someone says, "Please
enjoy these meats and cheeses?"

13:33.227 --> 13:35.795
- Yeah, those people are wrong.
- And stupid.

13:35.797 --> 13:38.296
- Stupid and dumb.
- Dumb and dumber.

13:38.298 --> 13:40.766
- Liar, liar.
- Pants on fire.

13:40.768 --> 13:42.368
Fire starter.

13:42.370 --> 13:44.837
- Drew Barrymore!
- Drew Barrymore!

13:44.839 --> 13:46.671
We got there naturally.

13:46.673 --> 13:49.775
You know you're flirting
with each other, right?

13:49.777 --> 13:51.911
- Who are you?
- Yeah, you wish.

13:51.913 --> 13:54.747
Well, this is going really well.

13:54.749 --> 13:57.349
Hey, girl, hey! Where you been at?

13:57.351 --> 14:00.386
Oh, my God, Reggie!

14:00.388 --> 14:03.723
If you hired another bartender,
you'd sell double the drinks!

14:03.725 --> 14:06.559
I shall not be giving
this place a good review!

14:06.561 --> 14:07.792
- Good one.
- Thank you.

14:07.794 --> 14:09.594
So who are you gonna start talkin' to?

14:09.596 --> 14:11.196
There's nobody here worth talkin' to.

14:11.198 --> 14:13.299
It feels like we're drinkin'
in an Urban Outfitters.

14:13.301 --> 14:15.600
You don't give the citizens
of this city enough credit.

14:15.602 --> 14:17.605
Have a little faith in humanity.

14:18.773 --> 14:20.805
God, I need a drink.

14:20.807 --> 14:22.541
I guess I could try to be more positive.

14:22.543 --> 14:23.745
Yeah.

14:26.447 --> 14:29.614
What's up, you fucking cock smokers?

14:29.616 --> 14:31.249
Why are you two alone? Oh!

14:31.251 --> 14:33.618
Are you guys like gay
boyfriends or something?

14:33.620 --> 14:36.222
Nope, I was right. Everyone is terrible.

14:36.224 --> 14:37.924
It's about time you get some pussy

14:37.926 --> 14:39.824
you fucking faggots.

14:39.826 --> 14:41.493
Ladies.

14:41.495 --> 14:42.762
Uh, what? Unbelievable!

14:42.764 --> 14:44.296
We've been waiting for 15 minutes.

14:44.298 --> 14:46.364
I will have a starburst

14:46.366 --> 14:47.800
and she will have..

14:47.802 --> 14:50.969
- A man in a van!
- I don't know what that is.

14:50.971 --> 14:53.839
It's a glassful of vodka, no ice

14:53.841 --> 14:56.441
with a piece of hard
candy at the bottom. Duh.

14:56.443 --> 14:58.877
'Cause if you want the candy, you gotta..

14:58.879 --> 15:01.280
- ...like, get super fucked!
- Like, get super fucked!

15:01.282 --> 15:03.382
Oh, my God.

15:03.384 --> 15:05.618
This is a bar. I don't have hard candy.

15:05.620 --> 15:08.320
Shit! Fine!

15:08.322 --> 15:10.223
I'll have black coffee with rum in it.

15:10.225 --> 15:12.624
Ugh, that cannot taste good.

15:12.626 --> 15:15.761
It doesn't. It tastes like hot shit.

15:15.763 --> 15:17.762
Then why did you order it?

15:17.764 --> 15:20.233
I don't know, dad!

15:20.235 --> 15:22.501
Maybe 'cause I wanted to!

15:22.503 --> 15:26.571
Hey, listen, you're buying
our drinks, Mr. Actor Man.

15:26.573 --> 15:30.642
We know! We know who
you are, Mr. Actor Man.

15:30.644 --> 15:34.412
So, Smash, I love you.

15:34.414 --> 15:36.281
My name's actually Matt.

15:36.283 --> 15:37.682
This is Dave.

15:37.684 --> 15:40.419
- That's Kimber.
- 'Bout it. 'Bout it.

15:40.421 --> 15:42.254
And I'm Chair.

15:42.256 --> 15:45.358
- Chair?
- No, Chair.

15:45.360 --> 15:47.560
Chair, like something you sit on?

15:47.562 --> 15:51.296
No, Chair, like my name.

15:51.298 --> 15:53.366
What is your full name?

15:53.368 --> 15:55.667
Charlotte.

15:55.669 --> 15:58.271
That's Char, not Chair.

15:58.273 --> 16:00.539
There is no "Chair" in Charlotte.

16:04.379 --> 16:05.744
Yeah, there is.

16:05.746 --> 16:08.013
Whoa..

16:08.015 --> 16:11.850
Boys, I don't, uh, normally do this

16:11.852 --> 16:14.753
but I love the show, those are on me.

16:14.755 --> 16:16.855
Thanks, man.

16:16.857 --> 16:20.695
And so... is this empty beer can.

16:25.832 --> 16:27.336
Okay.

16:28.503 --> 16:31.536
It was so nice to meet you.

16:31.538 --> 16:33.973
Fine, walk away!

16:33.975 --> 16:37.443
It's like you're on your fucking period!

16:37.445 --> 16:40.749
Later on! And legalize gay, right?

16:41.982 --> 16:44.316
What?

16:44.318 --> 16:45.917
Well, that was fun.

16:45.919 --> 16:48.054
I know it seems bad, okay?

16:48.056 --> 16:50.955
- Yeah, I think I'm gonna leave.
- Wait, no, don't leave yet.

16:50.957 --> 16:54.593
- We're so close. I can feel it.
- So close to what?

16:54.595 --> 16:56.695
I don't know. I'm makin'
this up as I go along.

16:56.697 --> 16:59.364
Hey, are you in that show?

16:59.366 --> 17:00.699
Yeah.

17:00.701 --> 17:02.501
- What show?
- You know "The Hard Life."

17:02.503 --> 17:04.336
The one about the people
in the trailer park.

17:04.338 --> 17:06.571
Oh, yeah. I heard that's good.
I keep meaning to watch it.

17:06.574 --> 17:08.773
She's never gonna watch
it. She doesn't watch TV.

17:08.776 --> 17:11.609
Well, he's very good in it. So
you should start watching TV.

17:11.612 --> 17:13.945
Thank you, but, uh, I encourage reading

17:13.948 --> 17:16.582
because, let's be honest, it's fundamental.

17:16.584 --> 17:18.550
Now, where do I know you from?

17:18.553 --> 17:20.652
- Uh...
- You know Dave?

17:20.654 --> 17:23.021
I feel I do. Are you in a show too?

17:23.022 --> 17:25.824
- Uh, no, I'm a writer.
- What do you write?

17:25.826 --> 17:28.827
- Uh, I write for...-
- He writes for TV.

17:28.829 --> 17:31.532
Wait. Do you do yoga?

17:32.633 --> 17:35.034
- Yes.
- You do yoga?

17:35.036 --> 17:36.802
- Yes.
- Oh, my God.

17:36.804 --> 17:38.804
- What?
- Oh, my God, you're that guy.

17:38.806 --> 17:40.439
He's the one I've been telling you about.

17:40.441 --> 17:42.708
You're the guy who stares
at my butt the whole class.

17:42.710 --> 17:46.879
What? No, no, no, I, I
don't stare at your butt. No.

17:46.881 --> 17:49.414
- How often do you do yoga?
- Not often.

17:49.416 --> 17:50.815
'He's there like three times a week.'

17:50.817 --> 17:53.419
- Like three times a week.
- Ew.

17:53.421 --> 17:56.020
So, do you like get off
on that type of thing?

17:56.022 --> 17:59.824
- Do you get yoga boners?
- No, I get regular boners.

17:59.826 --> 18:01.427
At home, in private.

18:01.429 --> 18:03.828
And I'm not staring at
your butt, I'm just focusing

18:03.830 --> 18:05.831
straight ahead and trying to stay balanced.

18:05.833 --> 18:07.165
Dave, I'm so proud of you, I didn't know

18:07.167 --> 18:08.867
you were such a pervert.

18:08.869 --> 18:11.437
Ha-ha-ha-ha. I'm
not a pervert.

18:11.439 --> 18:13.139
I'm just bad at yoga, okay? That's it.

18:13.141 --> 18:14.907
Hey, listen, I don't care.

18:14.909 --> 18:16.007
It's impossible to do yoga

18:16.009 --> 18:17.176
without staring at someone's ass.

18:17.178 --> 18:19.010
- Right.
- Right.

18:19.012 --> 18:20.779
How about I show you that we're cool?

18:20.781 --> 18:23.815
- I'll buy the next round.
- That would be stupendous.

18:23.817 --> 18:26.719
Yeah, the problem is we only
drink really high-end beer

18:26.721 --> 18:28.720
from like, up north.

18:28.722 --> 18:30.555
- Yeah.
- Like a northern state.

18:30.557 --> 18:33.092
Like a local, like, you know, microbrewery

18:33.094 --> 18:34.526
Ma and Pa type of mix..

18:34.528 --> 18:36.094
How about the cheapest beer they have?

18:36.096 --> 18:37.595
- I guess.
- Yeah, okay.

18:37.597 --> 18:38.730
- Unless we have to?
- I guess.

18:38.732 --> 18:40.565
I mean, we'll drink it.

18:40.567 --> 18:42.066
Oh, my gosh! They were just having sex.

18:42.068 --> 18:43.536
And you know Felicia's a hot mess.

18:43.538 --> 18:44.969
She'll be all up in the bus trying to get

18:44.971 --> 18:47.139
all these boys try to talk to her on a bus.

18:47.141 --> 18:49.708
Like really? On a, like a, on a bus?

18:49.710 --> 18:50.809
Fuck is wrong with her?

18:50.811 --> 18:53.211
Go get a car. Get a grip. Five-Gs.

18:55.016 --> 18:56.748
If you had a daughter

18:56.750 --> 18:59.084
and she had to marry a member of NSYNC

18:59.086 --> 19:01.219
which one would you want her to marry?

19:01.221 --> 19:03.721
- Joey Fatone.
- Wow, that was fast.

19:03.723 --> 19:05.958
Joey Fatone seems like a solid nice guy.

19:05.960 --> 19:07.826
Have you thought about this before?

19:07.828 --> 19:10.161
- Yes, I have.
- You're so dumb.

19:10.163 --> 19:12.832
- Uh, Dave.
- Mm-hm.

19:12.834 --> 19:14.600
What TV mom have you fantasized about?

19:14.602 --> 19:16.768
Mrs. Huxtable.

19:16.770 --> 19:18.636
Clair Huxtable?

19:18.638 --> 19:20.840
- Bill Cosby's wife?
- Yes.

19:20.842 --> 19:22.775
She's a lawyer, she's take charge

19:22.777 --> 19:23.942
but there is an underline

19:23.944 --> 19:25.678
sensuality that cannot be ignored.

19:25.680 --> 19:27.246
- You fantasized about her?
- Oh, my God!

19:27.248 --> 19:30.015
- Yes.
- You are a pervert.

19:30.017 --> 19:32.584
You said you'd have sex with Tom Selleck.

19:32.586 --> 19:34.586
Yeah, I would fuck him,
right now on that bar.

19:34.588 --> 19:35.720
- Am I right?
- Oh, yeah.

19:35.722 --> 19:37.222
- Oh, man.
- Phylicia Rashad?

19:37.224 --> 19:39.123
- Yes.
- Oh, my goodness.

19:39.125 --> 19:40.692
- She's sexy.
- Yes.

19:40.694 --> 19:43.929
Still, I guarantee you,
still is. She's still got.

19:43.931 --> 19:45.698
It's you to Syd.

19:45.700 --> 19:47.799
Uh, if you could do any job

19:47.801 --> 19:50.102
other than the one you're
doing now, what would it be?

19:50.104 --> 19:52.103
An actor.

19:52.105 --> 19:53.706
I thought you were an actor.

19:53.708 --> 19:56.241
I'm, I'm just a waitress.

19:56.243 --> 19:57.776
That's all I really do, I'm a..

19:57.778 --> 19:59.978
I'm a waitress tryin' to be an actor.

19:59.980 --> 20:03.047
It's very cliche and stupid.

20:03.049 --> 20:04.749
It's, it's not stupid.

20:04.751 --> 20:06.887
It's just, it just happens.

20:08.154 --> 20:09.988
Whose question is it? Um, me to you.

20:09.990 --> 20:13.859
What would you rather have,
um, two noses or three butts?

20:13.861 --> 20:17.529
- Uh, two...
- That's a terrible question.

20:17.531 --> 20:19.765
- I'm sorry.
- Three butts?

20:19.767 --> 20:21.267
Okay, how about this, if you could be in

20:21.269 --> 20:23.835
any movie ever made,
what movie would it be?

20:23.837 --> 20:26.138
- Hm.
- Okay. Okay.

20:26.140 --> 20:28.841
Alright, if it's a good
movie, I don't wanna be in it

20:28.843 --> 20:30.875
'cause I don't wanna mess up a good thing.

20:30.877 --> 20:33.011
So the question is what
bad movie do I think

20:33.013 --> 20:35.180
I can make better?

20:35.182 --> 20:37.850
And I would say "Newsies."

20:37.852 --> 20:39.552
I could dance circles
around Christian Bale.

20:39.554 --> 20:42.720
- "Newsies" is not a bad movie.
- You dance?

20:44.325 --> 20:46.027
What the fuck?

20:48.563 --> 20:50.194
Do any of you guys smoke?

20:50.196 --> 20:53.865
- Yeah.
- You want to go outside?

20:53.867 --> 20:55.736
- Okay.
- Okay.

20:56.604 --> 20:58.006
Okay.

21:06.113 --> 21:07.712
- Should we join them?
- Yeah, good!

21:07.714 --> 21:09.583
- Yeah, let's go there!
- Lets go up.

21:21.962 --> 21:24.596
- I only smoke when I drink.
- And?

21:24.598 --> 21:26.632
I drink a lot.

21:26.634 --> 21:28.667
It's impossible to just
have a drink outside a bar

21:28.669 --> 21:31.804
without drowning in cigarettes.

21:31.806 --> 21:33.905
That's a funny thing to think about.

21:33.907 --> 21:34.974
What?

21:34.976 --> 21:37.142
Someone drowning in cigarettes.

21:37.144 --> 21:38.744
It sounds like an anti-smoking ad

21:38.746 --> 21:40.345
where, you know, someone jumps into a pool

21:40.347 --> 21:43.748
filled with cigarettes and drowns.

21:43.750 --> 21:45.883
Yeah, but why is that funny?

21:45.885 --> 21:48.053
'Cause they're drowning. It's..

21:48.055 --> 21:50.322
Okay.

21:50.324 --> 21:54.125
So, like, where to next?

21:54.127 --> 21:55.259
- Uh, okay.
- Uh.. Whoa!

21:55.261 --> 21:58.063
- Oh, that's my..
- Sshh.

21:58.065 --> 22:00.766
Where is the party, butt fucker?

22:00.768 --> 22:02.301
Ladies, this is my wife.

22:03.738 --> 22:05.273
Are you wearing my jacket?

22:06.374 --> 22:08.239
What jacket?

22:08.241 --> 22:10.778
Honey, you're wearing a jacket right now.

22:12.346 --> 22:15.213
Oh. Yeah.

22:15.215 --> 22:17.048
Did you steal that from inside?

22:17.050 --> 22:21.786
I was cold. I didn't steal
it, I'm not a stealer.

22:21.788 --> 22:23.689
May I please have my jacket back?

22:23.691 --> 22:27.125
- Stop being so rude.
- Yeah.

22:27.127 --> 22:29.260
I'm a lady..

22:29.262 --> 22:30.996
...and I need your jacket.

22:30.998 --> 22:33.364
Well, I don't want you to throw up on it.

22:33.366 --> 22:35.433
You don't know..

22:35.435 --> 22:37.769
...what I'm gonna do.

22:37.771 --> 22:40.738
See I don't throw up anymore.

22:40.740 --> 22:42.908
I love myself.

22:42.910 --> 22:47.246
Okay. Um, why don't you just
give him back his jacket, honey?

22:47.248 --> 22:49.847
Don't be like that, you dumb bitch.

22:49.849 --> 22:51.719
You don't even know me.

22:53.019 --> 22:55.688
Oh, but I do.

22:55.690 --> 22:58.423
You think you're a unique, special flower

22:58.425 --> 23:00.025
but you're not.

23:00.027 --> 23:02.861
You're just fuck-able.

23:02.863 --> 23:05.363
And since guys want to
fuck you, they lie to you

23:05.365 --> 23:07.266
and act like it's cute when you get drunk

23:07.268 --> 23:09.101
and scream in bars.

23:09.103 --> 23:11.937
But one day, when you're older..

23:11.939 --> 23:14.739
...fuck-able will go away and no one

23:14.741 --> 23:17.476
will want you anymore.

23:17.478 --> 23:21.113
But don't worry, no one will
call you a loser or a failure

23:21.115 --> 23:22.748
because your existence

23:22.750 --> 23:25.718
will never be worth the word "Failure."

23:25.720 --> 23:28.253
Everyone will just
ignore you and forget you

23:28.255 --> 23:31.123
because you're worthless.

23:31.125 --> 23:34.125
So, in ten years, when I see you

23:34.127 --> 23:36.228
and you look at me with dead eyes

23:36.230 --> 23:39.097
from behind the counter of a Burger King

23:39.099 --> 23:43.201
the only words that I wanna
hear come out of your mouth

23:43.203 --> 23:45.970
are "Please kill me."

23:45.972 --> 23:47.405
And I won't

23:47.407 --> 23:51.245
because you're not worth it.

24:05.459 --> 24:07.292
Holy shit.

24:07.294 --> 24:09.495
That was fucking amazing.

24:09.497 --> 24:11.529
Are you okay?

24:11.531 --> 24:16.235
Uh, yeah. I'm shaking,
but I, I'm fucking great.

24:16.237 --> 24:19.771
'That was the meanest
thing I've ever heard.'

24:19.773 --> 24:21.073
Oh, damn it, she still has my jacket

24:21.075 --> 24:24.042
but that was totally worth it.

24:24.044 --> 24:25.477
Do you guys want to go to another bar?

24:25.479 --> 24:27.912
I wanna get, I wanna get drunk.

24:27.914 --> 24:30.047
Yeah. This place is dead anyway.

24:30.049 --> 24:32.151
Wait, I'm sorry, you
want to go to another bar?

24:32.153 --> 24:35.520
Yeah. This dumb bitch wants to get crunk.

24:40.161 --> 24:41.794
She's gonna kill herself.

24:41.796 --> 24:43.027
You, you may have caused a death...

24:43.029 --> 24:45.130
- Should I apologize?
- Oh, no.

24:45.132 --> 24:47.067
- I don't think...
- Yeah, hell no.

25:00.013 --> 25:01.913
- Hey, guy.
- Yes, hello.

25:01.915 --> 25:03.882
How may I help you?

25:03.884 --> 25:06.017
We're leaving if you want our table.

25:06.019 --> 25:09.054
Oh, that's great, thanks. <i>Gracias.</i>

25:09.056 --> 25:11.856
What did you just say to me?

25:11.858 --> 25:15.797
I said <i>"Gracias."</i> The
Spanish phrase for thank you.

25:20.433 --> 25:22.968
I was just fucking with
you. Man, come on, sit down.

25:22.970 --> 25:24.603
- Don't be afraid, come on.
- Come on, guys.

25:24.605 --> 25:27.040
- Thanks.
- Let's go girls.

25:32.512 --> 25:34.345
You guys have a great night.

25:34.347 --> 25:37.415
Remember, life is made up of experiences.

25:37.417 --> 25:40.518
And the greatest
experience of all, is love.

25:40.520 --> 25:42.356
Embrace it.

25:48.261 --> 25:51.395
- Well, that was unexpected.
- This place is fantastic.

25:51.397 --> 25:54.333
See, why do I make these assumptions?

25:54.335 --> 25:56.535
I thought that guy was gonna
punch me, but he didn't.

25:56.537 --> 25:58.871
He's a really nice guy
with a heart of gold.

25:58.873 --> 26:00.538
He could kick your ass
if he wanted to, though.

26:00.540 --> 26:03.141
You don't know that. I
mean, he probably could, yes.

26:03.143 --> 26:04.876
But you don't know that.

26:04.878 --> 26:07.411
Why are we ruled by these assumptions?

26:07.413 --> 26:09.614
Why do we assume that that
guy is a bad guy, you know.

26:09.616 --> 26:12.316
I mean, why do I assume
that this girl is a whore?

26:12.318 --> 26:14.886
I'm not talking about you. Why?

26:14.888 --> 26:16.421
Because she's dressed like one.

26:16.423 --> 26:18.323
I'm still not talking about you.

26:18.325 --> 26:20.625
I mean, for all we know, she
could be a doctor scientist

26:20.627 --> 26:22.326
on the verge of curing baby cancer.

26:22.328 --> 26:23.895
I'm a stripper.

26:23.897 --> 26:26.430
Yes, but we can't assume that.

26:26.432 --> 26:29.133
- That's what I'm saying.
- Stop yelling at strangers.

26:29.135 --> 26:30.235
I'm not yelling at people.

26:30.237 --> 26:31.303
I'm just talking about assumptions.

26:31.305 --> 26:33.337
Oh, fine. Fine.

26:33.339 --> 26:35.606
What assumptions are you
making about this place?

26:35.608 --> 26:39.210
Huh.. Well, I hate fruity drinks.

26:39.212 --> 26:41.246
So I assume I'll hate
the drinks of this place.

26:41.248 --> 26:44.048
- Okay.
- So what's your point?

26:44.050 --> 26:45.616
I'm ordering the fruitiest drink in here

26:45.618 --> 26:47.955
and I'm getting all of you the same thing.

26:49.056 --> 26:51.923
- Okay.
- He's kind of intense.

26:51.925 --> 26:54.959
- Yeah, he doesn't get out much.
- Yeah, well, neither does she.

26:54.961 --> 26:56.027
Shut up.

26:59.232 --> 27:01.933
So, Matt, are you working
on anything right now?

27:01.935 --> 27:04.169
Uh, yeah, the two of you, how am I doin'?

27:04.171 --> 27:05.536
Hey..

27:05.538 --> 27:07.605
Terrible, if you keep
making jokes like that.

27:07.607 --> 27:09.173
- Okay.
- Hm.

27:09.175 --> 27:11.109
No, I mean, are you still
filming "The Hard Life?"

27:11.111 --> 27:15.948
Uh, yeah, no.. Yeah, yeah.

27:15.950 --> 27:19.217
I'm, uh.. I'm only in
one episode in this season

27:19.219 --> 27:21.353
so I have a lot of free time.

27:21.355 --> 27:23.654
Oh, well, you must audition a ton.

27:23.656 --> 27:26.357
Yeah, I, I audition.

27:26.359 --> 27:28.459
Is that bad? I mean you don't
seem very excited about it.

27:28.461 --> 27:29.460
It seems like it's awesome.

27:29.462 --> 27:31.296
Syd, I don't think he
wants to talk about it.

27:31.298 --> 27:32.463
No, it's okay. It's okay, it's okay.

27:32.465 --> 27:33.731
Uh, the show that I'm on.

27:33.733 --> 27:36.133
- "The Hard Life?" It's amazing.
- Yes. Yes.

27:36.135 --> 27:38.402
It's amazing. It's the best
show ever, it's amazing.

27:38.404 --> 27:40.338
- Matt plays Smash on the show.
- Yeah.

27:40.340 --> 27:41.640
Who's Smash?

27:41.642 --> 27:44.209
He is a semi-retarded man child

27:44.211 --> 27:47.144
who smashes beer cans on his
head, hence the name Smash.

27:47.146 --> 27:49.146
Okay, that is a little on the nose.

27:49.148 --> 27:51.984
- 'It is.'
- It has to be fun though.

27:51.986 --> 27:53.651
It is. It is fun.

27:53.653 --> 27:56.054
For like, the two weeks
a year, I get to shoot

27:56.056 --> 27:58.990
but for the other 50,
I can't get other jobs

27:58.992 --> 28:02.160
because people are disappointed
that I'm not actually

28:02.162 --> 28:04.031
you know, semi-retarded.

28:05.566 --> 28:08.467
- People are so stupid.
- You have no idea.

28:08.469 --> 28:12.004
One time, I got invited
to a telethon for autism

28:12.006 --> 28:15.474
and I was like, awesome,
I'll go, I'll work the phones.

28:15.476 --> 28:18.543
You know, go on TV, wave.

28:18.545 --> 28:22.413
They wanted to use me as a success story

28:22.415 --> 28:25.586
of how you can overcome your challenges.

28:27.086 --> 28:28.420
Yikes.

28:28.422 --> 28:31.092
Well, at least you get recognized.

28:33.527 --> 28:35.760
And I realize that I have no right

28:35.762 --> 28:37.461
to complain about any of this

28:37.463 --> 28:39.398
because there are a million
people who would kill

28:39.400 --> 28:41.199
to be in my place and that makes me feel

28:41.201 --> 28:43.367
like an asshole and hate myself.

28:43.369 --> 28:46.371
So it's a classic Kobayashi Maru.

28:46.373 --> 28:47.671
What the fuck is that?

28:47.673 --> 28:49.207
An extremely nerdy Star Trek reference

28:49.209 --> 28:51.442
that I already regret bringing up.

28:51.444 --> 28:53.178
Why don't you just embrace the attention

28:53.180 --> 28:54.746
and see where it takes you?

28:54.748 --> 28:58.049
I.. Yeah.

28:58.051 --> 29:01.085
Embrace it? Re..

29:01.087 --> 29:03.721
What the fuck is wrong with you people?

29:03.723 --> 29:06.190
Look, alright, if you're
so sick of everyone thinkin'

29:06.192 --> 29:09.594
that you're some caricature,
do something what you're not.

29:09.596 --> 29:11.363
You know, make something, write something

29:11.365 --> 29:13.331
where you get to be a
real person, like, a play

29:13.333 --> 29:15.299
or a movie or whatever.

29:15.301 --> 29:17.436
And if you really wanna be an actor

29:17.438 --> 29:19.805
if that's really what you care
about, then go and do theatre.

29:19.807 --> 29:21.806
Those people actually care about talent.

29:21.808 --> 29:24.311
Oh, you think I'm talented?

29:27.146 --> 29:28.580
I've tried to find a
way to disagree with you

29:28.582 --> 29:29.680
but I'm having a hard time.

29:29.682 --> 29:31.615
Boo-yah.

29:31.617 --> 29:33.651
- Alright.
- Damn.

29:33.653 --> 29:36.621
You get a fruity drink
and you get a fruity drink.

29:36.623 --> 29:38.256
'Have you already had a couple?'

29:38.258 --> 29:39.724
Yeah, the bartender
gave me a couple of shots

29:39.726 --> 29:42.126
big ones and I'm feeling good.

29:42.128 --> 29:43.728
In fact, this calls for a toast.

29:43.730 --> 29:45.729
May the Tiki Gods, who have blessed us

29:45.731 --> 29:49.767
with these many flavors of rum,
continue to bless this night

29:49.769 --> 29:53.673
bless these burgeoning
friendships and bless our lives.

29:58.444 --> 30:00.879
- End of toast. Let's get drunk.
- Yeah.

30:31.744 --> 30:34.613
Hey, guys, how we doin'? Are we havin' fun?

30:44.691 --> 30:47.526
So there's Polynesia, okay,
and there's French Polynesia

30:47.528 --> 30:50.461
which is basically the same
thing except they speak French.

30:50.463 --> 30:52.564
'And then, what a lot of
people don't know is that'

30:52.566 --> 30:54.699
Tonga is actually part of Micronesia

30:54.701 --> 30:57.401
which is basically in
the same area but also..

30:57.403 --> 30:59.504
Just one more time, one
more time. Let's feel it.

30:59.506 --> 31:01.206
Let's feel it.

31:01.208 --> 31:02.908
Feel it, feel it. Feel it.

31:05.878 --> 31:09.349
Aw, man. Ah, yeah.

31:10.616 --> 31:12.383
Bye.

31:16.589 --> 31:20.691
- This bitch is taking forever.
- I wonder what she's doing.

31:20.693 --> 31:22.861
Well, either she's taking a shit

31:22.863 --> 31:24.763
or she's snorting cocaine

31:24.765 --> 31:27.632
but either way she's taking forever!

31:28.969 --> 31:30.634
I've never done coke.

31:30.636 --> 31:32.269
I was always too afraid of it, you know.

31:32.271 --> 31:34.206
Seems so dangerous. Coke.

31:34.208 --> 31:36.874
Yeah, it's overrated.

31:36.876 --> 31:39.210
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

31:39.212 --> 31:40.679
Makes you feel really smart and interesting

31:40.681 --> 31:42.346
while you're doing really dumb things

31:42.348 --> 31:44.982
like dating musicians

31:44.984 --> 31:46.718
dancing to techno music.

31:46.720 --> 31:49.453
- Ah, sounds terrible.
- Yeah.

31:49.455 --> 31:50.988
What drugs have you done?

31:50.990 --> 31:53.924
- Um, I have done weed.
- Mm-hm.

31:53.926 --> 31:58.596
Ecstasy, mushrooms, and ketamine, not many.

31:58.598 --> 31:59.631
- Yeah.
- Is that all?

31:59.633 --> 32:01.402
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

32:03.737 --> 32:07.605
Hey, uh, do you, uh, wanna use the men's?

32:07.607 --> 32:08.873
- And I'll just watch the door.
- Really?

32:08.875 --> 32:11.378
- Yeah-yeah.
- Oh, thank you.

32:17.451 --> 32:18.482
Were you just yelling at the door?

32:18.484 --> 32:19.918
No.

32:19.920 --> 32:21.452
Right, no, it sounded like a girls voice.

32:21.454 --> 32:23.688
Yeah, some girl, she left, she's crazy.

32:23.690 --> 32:25.323
She left, she's crazy.

32:25.325 --> 32:28.026
Why is everyone always in such a hurry?

32:28.028 --> 32:30.261
Life is a highway

32:30.263 --> 32:32.631
and then if you drive too fast,
you're gonna miss the off-ramp.

32:32.633 --> 32:34.902
And that's where the real fun happens.

32:35.836 --> 32:37.572
Yeah, yeah.

32:38.771 --> 32:42.539
Whatever, I got my bumps in before work.

32:42.541 --> 32:46.844
Speaking of work, I'm dancing tonight..

32:46.846 --> 32:48.513
...at the Lion's Den.

32:48.515 --> 32:50.815
- Oh, great.
- You can come by.

32:50.817 --> 32:54.518
I'm gonna give you the first
two, or three dances for free.

32:54.520 --> 32:55.786
- Okay.
- Okay, don't be a dick.

32:55.788 --> 32:58.555
Don't pick a long song.

32:58.557 --> 33:02.262
My name is Rainbow Sherbert.

33:03.763 --> 33:04.996
- Yeah.
- Okay.

33:04.998 --> 33:06.797
- So, okay?
- Yeah.

33:06.799 --> 33:09.968
- I will see you soon.
- Okay. I'll be there.

33:09.970 --> 33:12.804
- Okay, Smash.
- Okay. See ya.

33:12.806 --> 33:14.471
- Smash.
- Right.

33:14.473 --> 33:16.476
Smash.

33:18.644 --> 33:20.448
Holy shit!

33:21.914 --> 33:23.981
- That was amazing.
- Did you hear that?

33:23.983 --> 33:26.051
- Yes.
- Her name's Rainbow Sherbert.

33:26.053 --> 33:28.753
- That's ridiculous.
- So bad.

33:40.767 --> 33:43.371
Well, she obviously doesn't know me at all.

33:44.770 --> 33:47.375
Great hallway though. Good job, hallway.

33:49.608 --> 33:53.010
I can't believe.. You
actually like your job?

33:53.012 --> 33:54.978
- Sure.
- Nobody likes their job.

33:54.980 --> 33:56.780
- That's why it's called <i>a job.</i>
- Yeah.

33:56.782 --> 33:58.917
Otherwise it'll be called a fun.

33:58.919 --> 34:02.019
- I love my nine to five fun.
- Dave, you're screaming.

34:02.021 --> 34:04.988
- My point still stands.
- What'd you do again?

34:04.990 --> 34:07.092
I'm a market analyst for
an LA based hedge fund.

34:07.094 --> 34:09.827
- And you <i>like</i> that?
- Yup, I like that.

34:09.829 --> 34:12.063
'I get a free car, provided by my company.'

34:12.065 --> 34:15.032
I like that I live in LA,
but I'm not in the business.

34:15.034 --> 34:17.501
I like that I don't have to
deal with people very much.

34:17.503 --> 34:21.706
Just numbers. Oh, and I get
three weeks <i>paid</i> vacation.

34:21.708 --> 34:24.809
Yeah, but when was the last
time you took a vacation?

34:24.811 --> 34:26.143
- Two years.
- 'Mm-hm.'

34:26.146 --> 34:27.945
Jesus, has it been that long?

34:27.947 --> 34:30.148
They pay for your vacation?

34:30.150 --> 34:33.985
- Three weeks.
- Okay, I take it back.

34:33.987 --> 34:36.420
Point. Advantage, Amy.

34:36.422 --> 34:38.554
Service to you, Matt.

34:38.556 --> 34:39.724
What game are we playing right now?

34:39.726 --> 34:40.958
We're playing conversational tennis.

34:40.960 --> 34:42.458
Will you please keep up?

34:42.460 --> 34:44.561
Okay, I'm gonna go get him some water.

34:44.563 --> 34:46.429
Yeah, it's probably a good idea.

34:46.431 --> 34:48.867
- Two waters.
- Thank you.

34:48.869 --> 34:50.538
He's my friend.

34:53.672 --> 34:55.472
Mm.

34:55.474 --> 34:58.778
Yeah, and so that's why
I'm doin' what I'm doin'.

35:02.882 --> 35:04.849
Wh-what?

35:04.851 --> 35:06.950
Didn't you ask me a question?

35:06.952 --> 35:09.521
- No one said anything.
- What are you talking about?

35:09.523 --> 35:14.458
Oh, my job. My ambition is gone.

35:14.460 --> 35:17.461
- What's your job again?
- "Chub Cha Boo."

35:17.463 --> 35:19.798
- What?
- "Chub Cha Boo."

35:19.800 --> 35:21.999
Are-are those words?

35:22.001 --> 35:23.767
How drunk are you?

35:23.769 --> 35:25.737
The name of the TV show

35:25.739 --> 35:28.440
that I write for is called "Chub Cha Boo."

35:28.442 --> 35:30.141
- Oh.
- What is that even mean?

35:30.143 --> 35:32.142
Oh, you've never heard of the show?

35:32.144 --> 35:36.613
Oh, well, then, perhaps
this will ring a bell.

Bravo, bravo, bravo.

36:04.610 --> 36:07.679
Ah, it's a kid show
about a magical panda bear

36:07.681 --> 36:09.546
and his side kick, Yum Yum, the goat.

36:09.548 --> 36:11.883
They fight evil with hugs and positivity.

36:11.885 --> 36:14.985
- It is <i>huge</i> in Korea.
- Well, that's not so bad.

36:14.987 --> 36:17.488
Well, I write for the American version.

36:17.490 --> 36:19.190
- Oh.
- Oh..

36:19.192 --> 36:21.059
Ba-zingo!

36:21.061 --> 36:24.061
- Do, do you mean bingo?
- Yes, that's what I said.

36:24.063 --> 36:25.929
- Thank you.
- What're we talking about?

36:25.931 --> 36:27.865
Dave was telling us about Chubby Boo Boo.

36:27.867 --> 36:30.200
"Chub Cha Boo" is what it is called.

36:30.202 --> 36:32.170
- How much did he tell you?
- He sang us the theme song.

36:32.172 --> 36:34.738
Jesus, Dave, I was gone
for like two minutes.

36:34.740 --> 36:36.773
Well, then I hope you learned your lesson.

36:36.775 --> 36:38.909
Have you ever tried
writing on a different show?

36:38.911 --> 36:41.778
Hm, hm, no, I'm not interested

36:41.780 --> 36:43.248
in putting myself out there.

36:43.250 --> 36:45.516
It's just a job, it's not dating.

36:45.518 --> 36:48.052
Well, Matt, much like dating

36:48.054 --> 36:50.088
I don't want to get rejected anymore.

36:50.090 --> 36:52.724
- But you came out tonight?
- Yeah, what's your point?

36:52.726 --> 36:54.025
You came out tonight

36:54.027 --> 36:56.226
and any girl could have rejected you.

36:56.228 --> 36:58.630
I mean we could've
rejected you, but we didn't.

36:58.632 --> 37:00.664
- But you did.
- No.

37:00.666 --> 37:03.601
The first time we talked
to you, you were mean to us

37:03.603 --> 37:06.771
and then Matt turned to me,
and he goes "That was sexy."

37:06.773 --> 37:07.871
- No, I didn't.
- You did?

37:07.873 --> 37:09.206
- Yes, you did.
- No, no.

37:09.208 --> 37:10.909
- Yes, you did.
- No, I didn't.

37:10.911 --> 37:12.976
Yes, you did. Don't you be a lair, Matthew.

37:12.978 --> 37:14.244
- Okay.
- Don't you lie to me.

37:14.246 --> 37:15.847
Don't you look at my face and lie to me.

37:15.849 --> 37:18.282
Anyways, in the end, we didn't reject you.

37:18.284 --> 37:21.653
We came out and now, we're all having fun.

37:21.655 --> 37:25.255
You guys are super cool, we
just got lucky with you guys.

37:25.257 --> 37:27.624
Hey, but who's to say
you won't get lucky again?

37:27.626 --> 37:29.760
Listen, you cannot be scared

37:29.762 --> 37:31.095
and just run away from everything.

37:31.097 --> 37:32.896
You gotta put your balls out there

37:32.898 --> 37:34.632
even if they might get chopped off.

37:34.634 --> 37:36.233
- Wow, very graphic.
- Yeah.

37:36.235 --> 37:38.970
Yeah, that's so graphic, I don't
want my balls to get chopped...

37:38.972 --> 37:40.972
No, but, even if they do, it's okay

37:40.974 --> 37:43.206
because they'll grow back.

37:43.208 --> 37:45.642
I don't think that's possible.

37:45.644 --> 37:47.244
I don't know, I'm not a starfish.

37:47.246 --> 37:49.914
All I'm trying to say
is that the only things

37:49.916 --> 37:51.249
that are worth achieving

37:51.251 --> 37:53.787
are the things that take risk to achieve.

37:55.221 --> 37:57.688
Holy fucking crap, you're smart.

37:57.690 --> 38:00.126
At least that's what I keep telling myself.

38:01.661 --> 38:04.128
Conversational tennis is over.

38:04.130 --> 38:06.363
New game, new game that I'm inventing

38:06.365 --> 38:11.068
right now, right here is called... Risk!

38:11.070 --> 38:14.137
- That's already a game.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

38:14.139 --> 38:16.807
With the countries and
the armies and stuff, yeah.

38:16.809 --> 38:20.110
Okay, then I shall call my new game..

38:20.112 --> 38:22.146
...Risky Business!

38:22.148 --> 38:24.081
- That's a movie.
- Uh, yeah.

38:24.083 --> 38:26.918
With the cruise and the
sex and the train, right.

38:26.920 --> 38:30.387
Okay, how about... Risk it?

38:30.389 --> 38:31.822
Does it need a name?

38:31.824 --> 38:34.659
I am a creative person, so yes.

38:34.661 --> 38:36.693
Okay. How do we play the
game? We all love games.

38:36.695 --> 38:39.896
Oh, we go to a house party.

38:39.898 --> 38:43.133
- Where is this party?
- It's at Rick Ramsey's house.

38:43.135 --> 38:44.901
Wait, you guys know Rick Ramsey?

38:44.903 --> 38:46.204
- Yeah, do you?
- Yeah.

38:46.206 --> 38:48.338
We've been friends for like two years.

38:48.340 --> 38:49.874
Man, everybody knows Rick Ramsey.

38:49.876 --> 38:53.276
Yeah, everybody knows Rick Ram!

38:53.278 --> 38:55.278
You guys didn't like date, did you?

38:55.280 --> 38:57.648
- What? Oh, my God, no.
- Oh.

38:57.650 --> 38:58.983
- No.
- Good 'cause...

38:58.985 --> 39:00.351
- No, I mean he's great...
- Yeah.

39:00.353 --> 39:02.220
Yeah, he's, but.. No.

39:02.222 --> 39:04.389
Okay, who's driving?

39:04.391 --> 39:06.990
I cannot, I will admit it.

39:06.992 --> 39:09.026
- You sure about it?
- I just, I'm..

39:09.028 --> 39:10.597
I just started to feel it.

39:14.034 --> 39:16.333
- Hey.
- It's us, we're the people.

39:16.335 --> 39:18.202
- We're the people.
- Hi.

39:18.204 --> 39:20.204
Hey, and hey, I just watched

39:20.206 --> 39:22.005
you come here on my phone.

39:22.007 --> 39:25.742
Yeah, I saw you drive
up. Technology is scary.

39:25.744 --> 39:28.045
- Yeah.
- Where are you folks headed?

39:28.047 --> 39:32.416
Oh, uh, we are going to 1620, Buena Loma.

39:32.418 --> 39:34.719
Not a problem.

39:34.721 --> 39:36.320
Do you know where that is?

39:36.322 --> 39:39.322
Absolutely, sweetheart. That's my job.

39:39.324 --> 39:42.159
You kids just sit back and enjoy the ride.

39:42.161 --> 39:45.329
I'll get you there safely
and in no time at all.

39:45.331 --> 39:47.898
You see, time flies by
when you're in good company.

39:47.900 --> 39:50.303
And I can tell you folks are good company.

39:52.072 --> 39:56.010
Thank you. That's really sweet.

39:59.945 --> 40:02.780
- What are you doin'?
- Oh, hello.

40:02.782 --> 40:05.749
Hi. Don't stare at my boobs, weirdo.

40:05.751 --> 40:08.786
Oh, I'm sorry, they're just right there.

40:08.788 --> 40:11.088
I was thinking about
something and then I zoned out

40:11.090 --> 40:13.391
and I just so happened to
be staring at your chest.

40:13.393 --> 40:14.992
- I'm not a weirdo.
- It's okay.

40:14.994 --> 40:16.226
I'm just a human man.

40:16.228 --> 40:17.494
No, it's not that big of a deal.

40:17.496 --> 40:19.896
Okay, good.

40:19.898 --> 40:22.066
- But they are a good sized...
- Oh, it's okay, alright.

40:22.068 --> 40:23.400
- You can stop now.
- Damn it.

40:23.402 --> 40:26.403
- Sorry, he's really drunk.
- It's okay.

40:26.405 --> 40:28.505
You don't, you don't have it

40:28.507 --> 40:31.342
always together either, buddy.

40:31.344 --> 40:35.345
- Oh, wait, so what's your name?
- Wanda Eileen Dubois.

40:35.347 --> 40:37.014
But just call me Wanda.

40:37.016 --> 40:39.083
Wanda, you're a wonderful driver.

40:39.085 --> 40:40.351
Well, thank you, honey.

40:40.353 --> 40:42.153
Do people tell you that enough?

40:42.155 --> 40:45.021
No, you'd be surprised
by the good in people

40:45.023 --> 40:47.992
if you just give 'em a chance.

40:47.994 --> 40:51.329
- You're very positive.
- What's the alternative?

40:51.331 --> 40:53.798
Being a rain cloud here
in Southern California?

40:53.800 --> 40:55.199
Now that just don't fit.

40:55.201 --> 40:56.367
- Yeah.
- You're amazing!

40:56.369 --> 40:57.534
- I guess.
- Just great.

40:57.536 --> 40:59.436
So is this a double date

40:59.438 --> 41:00.972
or are you still trying to figure out

41:00.974 --> 41:02.472
who to pair with who?

41:04.476 --> 41:08.179
Jesus, Wanda, that's-that's
a little on the nose.

41:08.181 --> 41:10.213
Well, I'd really not beat
around the bush, you know.

41:10.215 --> 41:11.816
In this city there ain't
enough time in the day

41:11.818 --> 41:12.883
to plant bushes.

41:12.885 --> 41:15.952
- What?
- Yeah, I guess.

41:15.954 --> 41:17.554
No, we're just out having fun.

41:17.556 --> 41:19.322
We all just met tonight actually.

41:19.324 --> 41:20.791
- Really?
- Yeah.

41:20.793 --> 41:22.325
Well, good for you.

41:22.327 --> 41:24.961
These are the times that
make life worth living.

41:24.963 --> 41:28.999
Good times. G-Ts.

41:29.001 --> 41:30.467
I meet a lot of people looking for just

41:30.469 --> 41:33.104
one or two of those in a lifetime.

41:33.106 --> 41:35.940
I mean, think about it

41:35.942 --> 41:38.943
if Alice hadn't followed
that rabbit down that hole

41:38.945 --> 41:40.945
then she'd just be another
spoiled English bitch

41:40.947 --> 41:43.016
sleepin' under a tree.

41:44.550 --> 41:47.985
Wanda, you are blowing my mind.

41:47.987 --> 41:49.153
That's my job.

41:49.155 --> 41:50.822
I need to know which roads are the best

41:50.824 --> 41:53.023
if I'm gonna take people
to where they wanna go.

41:53.025 --> 41:54.527
One way or the other.

41:59.264 --> 42:01.268
Are you a ghost?

42:03.168 --> 42:04.601
I don't think so.

42:08.240 --> 42:10.344
Well, we're here.

42:13.045 --> 42:15.412
But just because you've
arrived at your destination

42:15.414 --> 42:17.347
doesn't mean the journey's over.

42:17.349 --> 42:20.184
Sydney, don't worry, you're
gonna find that thing in life

42:20.186 --> 42:23.354
that fits you so well, it's all
you're ever gonna wanna wear.

42:23.356 --> 42:26.257
And Amy, you're a beautiful flower.

42:26.259 --> 42:30.561
All you need is a little
water, sunshine and TLC.

42:30.563 --> 42:33.197
Matt, sweetie, get your
head out of your ass.

42:33.199 --> 42:35.499
Thanks, Wanda. Have a good night.

42:35.501 --> 42:38.034
- And David, call your mother.
- Mm-hm.

42:38.036 --> 42:41.140
I will, Wanda. I will.

43:14.974 --> 43:19.610
Hey, Matt, do it again.

43:19.612 --> 43:23.246
Seriously? Hey, fuck you, dick.

43:23.248 --> 43:25.249
And so I booked this shop the other day

43:25.251 --> 43:27.284
and they basically said
"Hey, you just have to come

43:27.286 --> 43:29.052
and you just have to show your feet."

43:29.054 --> 43:31.554
And it's, like, just
sneakers, can you believe that?

43:31.556 --> 43:33.925
I get paid to do that.
That's insane, right?

43:40.032 --> 43:42.999
Hey, we're going at it, right.
Boom boom boom boom boom boom.

43:43.001 --> 43:45.970
I looked in the doorway, it's cracked open

43:45.972 --> 43:47.671
her mom is watching.

43:47.673 --> 43:49.106
- No.
- No!

43:49.108 --> 43:51.879
- Mom is watching.
- No.

44:00.686 --> 44:02.086
- Yeah.
- 'Pretty good.'

44:02.088 --> 44:04.088
- It looks killer.
- Syd!

44:04.090 --> 44:05.392
Hey, girl!

44:08.628 --> 44:11.595
V! Hi.

44:11.597 --> 44:13.229
- Hi, hi, hi.
- What're you doing here?

44:13.231 --> 44:15.700
Oh, you know, I'm, um,
I'm friends with Jerry

44:15.702 --> 44:17.334
who, who knows Rick Ramsey?

44:17.336 --> 44:19.103
Yeah. Everybody knows the Rick Ram.

44:20.373 --> 44:22.340
- Oh, this is my friend, Amy.
- Hey.

44:22.342 --> 44:24.208
Yeah, Jerry and I actually were working

44:24.210 --> 44:27.610
on this project last week it's
like this, like experimental

44:27.612 --> 44:29.479
short film, music video thing

44:29.481 --> 44:33.684
that actually this guy that
used to be McG's assistant

44:33.686 --> 44:36.420
he wrote and produced the whole thing.

44:36.422 --> 44:41.224
So, it's getting like a
lot of heat around town.

44:41.226 --> 44:45.695
Um, so, I'm, I'm everything,
you know, I'm excited

44:45.697 --> 44:49.266
I'm nervous, I'm, I'm super
hopeful, um, and it's great.

44:49.268 --> 44:50.568
The whole thing's, um, MOS

44:50.570 --> 44:52.570
because it's a music video, right?

44:52.572 --> 44:54.572
So, um, I'm not really worried

44:54.574 --> 44:58.008
that I don't have lines as of right now

44:58.010 --> 45:01.077
because, you know, I really
got to stretch myself.

45:01.079 --> 45:02.646
I stretched myself so much and you know

45:02.648 --> 45:06.383
it's not about like me
as one person, you know.

45:06.385 --> 45:08.084
Like not everything is me, me, me.

45:08.086 --> 45:10.653
It's like about the project as a whole.

45:10.655 --> 45:12.389
You know, what I mean? And I'm just..

45:12.391 --> 45:14.657
I'm just falling in love with "The Craft."

45:14.659 --> 45:17.596
Oh, "The Craft," the
movie with the witches?

45:19.766 --> 45:22.298
- What?
- Yeah, the movie, "The Craft."

45:22.300 --> 45:23.467
You know with Fairuza Balk?

45:23.469 --> 45:24.802
I used to love that movie too

45:24.804 --> 45:26.440
when I was 12.

45:29.242 --> 45:30.673
Okay, here's mine. Here's mine. Okay.

45:30.675 --> 45:32.776
Alright, here's mine.
We dated for two weeks.

45:32.778 --> 45:35.278
The whole time she told
me her name was Julia.

45:35.280 --> 45:37.213
Then offhandedly one day she tells me

45:37.215 --> 45:39.282
her name is actually Sarah.

45:39.284 --> 45:41.184
I asked her, like, why did you lie?

45:41.186 --> 45:43.554
She tells me that the
name Sarah was too boring

45:43.556 --> 45:45.389
so she tells me that her name's Julia

45:45.391 --> 45:47.624
because her favorite
actress is Julia Roberts.

45:47.626 --> 45:50.427
- Holy-moly.
- Oh, goddamn.

45:50.429 --> 45:52.496
That's crazy, that's-that's real crazy.

45:52.498 --> 45:53.697
- Yeah, yeah.
- Crazy.

45:53.699 --> 45:55.266
Find better Julias than that.

45:55.268 --> 45:57.233
How long did you, uh, go
out with her after that?

45:57.235 --> 45:59.070
Two more weeks, huge tits.

45:59.072 --> 46:01.539
- Oh, yeah.
- That makes sense.

46:01.541 --> 46:04.809
- There is the math on that.
- There is the math.

46:04.811 --> 46:08.144
I got one, okay, so when
I arrived in Los Angeles

46:08.146 --> 46:10.581
I had $1000 dollars to my name.

46:10.583 --> 46:14.751
I spent $800 of it on
a 1994 Toyota Corolla.

46:14.753 --> 46:18.621
Met a girl, Rachel. We dated for one month.

46:18.623 --> 46:21.858
Then one day, I let her borrow my car.

46:21.860 --> 46:25.329
And I never saw her again.

46:25.331 --> 46:26.697
Oh, she stole your car?

46:26.699 --> 46:28.766
She stole my car.

46:28.768 --> 46:30.434
- That is fucked up.
- No.

46:30.436 --> 46:32.503
- Fucked up is right.
- Yeah.

46:32.505 --> 46:34.137
Then two months later

46:34.139 --> 46:36.673
I get a call from the police department.

46:36.675 --> 46:38.476
'And they say "Your car's been located'

46:38.478 --> 46:40.376
"in the grocery store parking lot

46:40.378 --> 46:41.644
In Sonoma, California."

46:41.646 --> 46:44.248
So, I get on a train and go

46:44.250 --> 46:47.150
nine and a half hours to get my car.

46:47.152 --> 46:49.787
And then I think to myself,
well, I'm surrounded by wine

46:49.789 --> 46:51.621
I should have some of that.

46:51.623 --> 46:54.724
So I go and get drunk at a winery

46:54.726 --> 46:57.193
with a bus load of Swedish people.

46:57.195 --> 47:00.331
Two of whom are
40-year-old divorcee's

47:00.333 --> 47:03.434
that I end up having a threesome with.

47:03.436 --> 47:05.836
- Oh, sweet.
- Jesus.

47:05.838 --> 47:08.438
Thank you, Rachel, for stealing my car.

47:08.440 --> 47:09.840
'Cause that got me a threesome.

47:14.480 --> 47:16.380
Hey, Brian, what's up, man?

47:16.382 --> 47:18.715
Matt, hey.

47:18.717 --> 47:22.385
- Are you crying?
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

47:22.387 --> 47:24.255
No. What's going on?

47:24.257 --> 47:27.791
Uh, nothing, where's Stacy?

47:27.793 --> 47:29.492
Uh, we broke up.

47:29.494 --> 47:31.762
Oh, my God. Oh, I'm so sorry.

47:31.764 --> 47:33.863
- I didn't know, I didn't...
- It's-it's-it's fine.

47:33.865 --> 47:36.200
I'm fine. It's cool.

47:36.202 --> 47:38.434
Oh, okay.

47:38.436 --> 47:40.336
Weren't you together for like five years?

47:40.338 --> 47:43.440
Six, and engaged for two.

47:43.442 --> 47:45.708
Jesus, man, I'm so sorry.

47:45.710 --> 47:46.911
No don't-don't be.

47:46.913 --> 47:48.912
Matt, I'm-I'm-I'm,
I'm back on the prowl.

47:48.914 --> 47:52.215
Ready to party, you know.

47:52.217 --> 47:53.853
Ladies.

47:58.824 --> 48:00.891
When did this happen?
Wh-when did you break up?

48:00.893 --> 48:05.262
Oh, it was like last night.
Well, technically this morning.

48:05.264 --> 48:07.798
Last night? I-I mean,
you shouldn't be here.

48:07.800 --> 48:09.300
- You need to go home.
- No, man..

48:09.302 --> 48:10.733
- Take care of yourself.
- I-I, no, no, I, I..

48:10.735 --> 48:14.338
You know, I'm glad I had
this party, have some drinks.

48:14.340 --> 48:17.374
See some friends. Ah-ha!

48:17.376 --> 48:19.642
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

48:19.644 --> 48:21.644
Well, you look great.

48:21.646 --> 48:24.215
Oh, my God, stop.

48:24.217 --> 48:25.548
But thank you though.

48:25.550 --> 48:27.550
- Thank you, so do you.
- Thank you, thanks.

48:27.552 --> 48:29.452
Yeah, I'm um, actually doing this

48:29.454 --> 48:33.356
like half yogalaties, half
cross-fit classes, it's not..

48:33.358 --> 48:36.226
And my teacher is Rose McGowan.

48:37.597 --> 48:39.796
She makes classic such a fun.

48:39.798 --> 48:41.898
Um, really safe

48:41.900 --> 48:43.633
environment, yeah.

48:43.635 --> 48:45.336
It's amazing that the first half is like

48:45.338 --> 48:48.304
um, hardcore core training,
like for your core.

48:48.306 --> 48:49.940
And then the second half is just like

48:49.942 --> 48:51.976
almost like being at a party

48:51.978 --> 48:53.610
where they're just playing like a lot of..

48:53.612 --> 48:56.412
I don't know, Portishead. It's great.

48:56.414 --> 48:58.715
But my ass never felt tighter

48:58.717 --> 49:00.851
and my center, it just feels super like

49:00.853 --> 49:04.420
like grounded, and like
really, really on track.

49:04.422 --> 49:06.825
I think it would be great for you.

49:19.605 --> 49:21.604
Do you guys wanna come in with me?

49:21.606 --> 49:23.307
We just watched you shit out of your mouth

49:23.309 --> 49:25.679
we don't need to see it
come out of your ass too.

49:29.882 --> 49:32.650
If I ever fucking turn into that...

49:32.652 --> 49:34.050
Slit your throat and push you down a well.

49:34.052 --> 49:36.519
No, sit me down and talk to me about it.

49:36.521 --> 49:37.655
What is gotten into you?

49:37.657 --> 49:39.555
I don't know. I am amped up.

49:39.557 --> 49:41.594
I just feel like getting into a fight.

49:43.028 --> 49:45.496
- I got one.
- Oh, alright.

49:45.498 --> 49:47.764
- Here we go.
- What's.. Which story?

49:47.766 --> 49:49.700
The girl in Schoenberg.

49:49.702 --> 49:52.469
No, don't tell 'em.

49:52.471 --> 49:54.737
So, I was in Schoenberg
and this girl comes up to me

49:54.739 --> 49:57.508
and she says "Can I borrow a cigarette?"

49:57.510 --> 49:59.876
Next thing you know, long story short

49:59.878 --> 50:01.912
I'm getting a blowjob in my car.

50:01.914 --> 50:02.979
From her.

50:02.981 --> 50:05.481
So, a-a-anyway,
so like

50:05.483 --> 50:07.717
I'm-I'm going to take
her home or wherever.

50:07.719 --> 50:09.552
And I go, "We're-we're
gonna drop you off."

50:09.554 --> 50:12.423
And she says to me.. Get this.

50:12.425 --> 50:14.027
She's homeless.

50:16.061 --> 50:18.329
She didn't have a home.

50:18.331 --> 50:22.700
I can't drop her off anywhere
cause she doesn't live anywhere.

50:22.702 --> 50:24.334
Got a blowjob from a homeless person?

50:24.336 --> 50:25.605
Yeah.

50:27.539 --> 50:28.871
You give her money?

50:28.873 --> 50:31.974
Well, she was homeless
and she blew me, so yeah.

50:31.976 --> 50:36.045
Well, then, then technically,
she's a prostitute.

50:36.047 --> 50:38.484
She was a homeless prostitute, technically.

50:39.719 --> 50:41.084
Told you not to tell us the story, man.

50:41.086 --> 50:43.753
Right, wait, wait how did
this blowjob take place?

50:43.755 --> 50:45.856
Oh, she came up to me and she
asked if I was from around...

50:45.858 --> 50:47.657
Just stop, stop telling the story.

50:47.659 --> 50:48.691
Why it's funny and fucked up.

50:48.693 --> 50:50.827
No, it's not funny, at all.

50:50.829 --> 50:52.795
It's only fucked up. It's..

50:52.797 --> 50:55.766
The only part of that
story is that it's fucked.

50:55.768 --> 50:57.534
You're a goddamn idiot.

50:57.536 --> 50:58.668
- Alright.
- 'He is an idiot.'

50:58.670 --> 51:00.537
'I know, but just..'

51:00.539 --> 51:02.673
It's probably not a good idea
that you're drinking now, man.

51:02.675 --> 51:04.041
It's probably just not.

51:04.043 --> 51:05.809
What you wanna do, wanna do some whippets?

51:05.811 --> 51:09.612
Whippets, no, no. No, I'm
not a troubled 15-year-old.

51:09.614 --> 51:12.782
- That's okay.
- I wish.

51:12.784 --> 51:14.550
You wish what?

51:14.552 --> 51:17.787
I wish I was 15 again. Start over.

51:17.789 --> 51:20.360
You know, get it right, this time.

51:23.094 --> 51:27.063
Well, um, what happened,
why-why did you break up?

51:27.065 --> 51:29.932
I don't know, she said, she was, uh

51:29.934 --> 51:32.536
tired of trying to always make me happy.

51:32.538 --> 51:34.470
What does that mean?

51:34.472 --> 51:37.173
Some bullshit about me being depressed.

51:37.175 --> 51:39.976
And uh, she says that I-I always

51:39.978 --> 51:42.781
rely on other people to make
me feel good about myself.

51:44.182 --> 51:45.849
Well, do you think that's true?

51:45.851 --> 51:48.755
No, I just can't be alone right now.

51:50.021 --> 51:51.423
Yeah.

51:53.125 --> 51:54.590
- Thanks for talking to me.
- Yeah, yeah, sure.

51:54.592 --> 51:56.559
- Thanks.
- Sure.

51:56.561 --> 51:57.963
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

51:59.864 --> 52:01.130
How are you? How are you?

52:01.132 --> 52:03.936
Good, good. Um, things are good.

52:06.672 --> 52:09.673
This is my favorite thing to do at parties.

52:09.675 --> 52:10.840
Go through other people's shit?

52:10.842 --> 52:12.378
Oh, yeah.

52:14.880 --> 52:16.546
This place could be really nice.

52:16.548 --> 52:19.182
Maybe if they cleaned it once a year.

52:19.184 --> 52:21.485
The place is so dirty.

52:21.487 --> 52:23.954
Yeah, but when girls are
dirty it's so much worse.

52:23.956 --> 52:25.222
That's not true.

52:25.224 --> 52:26.889
Have you ever been in a hot bathroom

52:26.891 --> 52:29.626
in the middle of summer with
a trashcan full of tampons?

52:29.628 --> 52:31.695
Smells like a civil war field hospital.

52:31.697 --> 52:32.899
You're disgusting.

52:35.867 --> 52:38.538
Hello. Almost finished.

52:43.675 --> 52:45.608
That's Rick Ramsey, by the way.
The one getting the blowjob.

52:45.610 --> 52:47.144
That's..

52:47.146 --> 52:48.979
Huh.

52:48.981 --> 52:50.646
Ugh.

52:50.648 --> 52:53.916
It would be so much fun to have a dick.

52:53.918 --> 52:56.753
- What?
- I wish I had a dick.

52:56.755 --> 52:59.655
For just like one day.
You know a dick for a day.

52:59.657 --> 53:00.724
Hey, what are you talking about?

53:00.726 --> 53:02.559
You know, just so I could
see what it feels like

53:02.561 --> 53:04.760
to just stick it in something, you know.

53:04.762 --> 53:06.530
They just.. Looks like so much fun.

53:06.532 --> 53:08.065
Yeah, that's what it really does.

53:08.067 --> 53:09.999
- Yeah.
- Dicks are so direct.

53:10.001 --> 53:12.769
- Mm-hmm.
- Vaginas are so..

53:14.005 --> 53:16.106
- Yeah.
- Really?

53:17.675 --> 53:18.878
Just..

53:22.181 --> 53:24.615
Welcome, ladies.

53:24.617 --> 53:28.684
I apologize for an awkward interaction.

53:28.686 --> 53:30.753
Oh, not a problem.

53:30.755 --> 53:32.923
This is my friend, Amy by the way.

53:32.925 --> 53:36.193
A pleasure to meet you, Amy.

53:36.195 --> 53:37.661
I'm gonna pass.

53:37.663 --> 53:40.898
Oh, on account of the blowjob

53:40.900 --> 53:43.534
I was just receiving in this room?

53:43.536 --> 53:45.702
- Yeah.
- Understandable.

53:48.306 --> 53:50.072
I have to get this.

53:50.074 --> 53:52.110
It's my broker in Japan.

53:59.617 --> 54:02.119
Saskia, titan of industry

54:02.121 --> 54:03.556
and a true patriot.

54:04.989 --> 54:07.590
I see you ladies are sans beverage?

54:07.592 --> 54:09.092
You're all out downstairs.

54:09.094 --> 54:14.030
Oh, Sydsy, Amy..

54:14.032 --> 54:16.099
...there is one thing
you need to know about me.

54:16.101 --> 54:19.135
I am never without drink.

54:19.137 --> 54:23.874
May I escort you to the... den?

54:23.876 --> 54:26.043
You have a den?

54:26.045 --> 54:28.177
Oh, yes.

54:28.179 --> 54:29.882
I have a den.

54:32.818 --> 54:35.318
So, we're eating a toast, I look over.

54:35.320 --> 54:38.188
Chad Michael Murray,
is pointing right at me.

54:38.190 --> 54:39.990
Yeah, he's pointing right at Blake.

54:39.992 --> 54:41.224
- Topher was there.
- Oh, yeah, I was there.

54:41.226 --> 54:42.693
I saw the whole thing go down.

54:42.695 --> 54:43.961
So, since he's pointing right at me

54:43.963 --> 54:45.929
I waved thinking he remembers me.

54:45.931 --> 54:48.030
Yeah, 'cause we were at this
party at Zach Levi's house

54:48.032 --> 54:50.700
like a week earlier, getting
drunk, telling stories

54:50.702 --> 54:51.834
drinking Margis.

54:51.836 --> 54:53.572
Oh, Margaritas.

54:55.139 --> 54:56.907
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I know what that is.

54:56.909 --> 54:58.976
But it turns out Chad Michael Murray

54:58.978 --> 55:01.811
was actually pointing at Raven Simone

55:01.813 --> 55:03.246
who was sitting just to my right.

55:03.248 --> 55:04.680
Yeah, we didn't even realize

55:04.682 --> 55:06.215
she was in the restaurant, do you know why?

55:06.217 --> 55:09.019
'Cause she looks like a thousand
times prettier in person.

55:09.021 --> 55:10.320
So pretty.

55:10.322 --> 55:12.956
- I mean, so so pretty.
- So pretty.

55:12.958 --> 55:14.657
So Chad Michael Murray is trying to get

55:14.659 --> 55:17.193
Raven Simone's attention,
waving and what not.

55:17.195 --> 55:19.262
Yeah, and you know what Raven Simone does?

55:19.264 --> 55:23.867
She gets up, pays her check
and walks out of the restaurant.

55:23.869 --> 55:26.036
She didn't even realize he
was trying to wave at her.

55:26.038 --> 55:28.371
So, now Chad Michael Murray looks at me

55:28.373 --> 55:30.840
and now he gives me a face like..

55:30.842 --> 55:32.409
Like this face like..

55:32.411 --> 55:34.244
What the hell?

55:34.246 --> 55:36.045
It's like a face, like..

55:36.047 --> 55:37.347
- Why didn't she notice me?
- Yeah?

55:37.349 --> 55:39.048
I'm Chad Michael Murray, which is what

55:39.050 --> 55:40.784
I would think too if I
was Chad Michael Murray.

55:40.786 --> 55:42.952
Exactly, so you're not gonna
believe what Blake does.

55:42.954 --> 55:44.920
He looks right
over at C-M-M

55:44.922 --> 55:45.956
and he goes..

55:45.958 --> 55:48.927
"Oh, that's so Raven."

55:51.730 --> 55:53.396
- Yeah, like from the show.
- The show!

55:53.398 --> 55:55.264
From the TV show, come on.

55:55.266 --> 55:57.066
How many opportunities do
you get to say that for real?

55:57.068 --> 55:59.235
I laughed so hard.

55:59.237 --> 56:01.304
Here we have the den.

56:01.306 --> 56:03.974
Who the fuck are you? Freeze.

56:03.976 --> 56:05.876
I'm Topher. I'm your agents assistant.

56:05.878 --> 56:07.847
- This is Blake.
- Hi.

56:09.681 --> 56:11.947
Oh, okay.

56:14.820 --> 56:16.356
You're cool.

56:19.123 --> 56:20.259
Wait..

56:21.793 --> 56:23.860
Which agent?

56:23.862 --> 56:26.128
Your commercial agent.

56:26.130 --> 56:28.932
Get the fuck outta here!

56:28.934 --> 56:31.034
I recognize your puny voice.

56:31.036 --> 56:33.003
You're the little bitch,
who answers the phone

56:33.005 --> 56:35.137
and acts like you're doing
me some sort of favor.

56:35.139 --> 56:37.773
You work for me, you fucking slaves!

56:37.775 --> 56:41.043
Sending me to Santa Monica,
on a Friday at 6 o'clock.

56:41.045 --> 56:45.014
I should fuck you in the
ass until you're dead.

56:45.016 --> 56:48.719
Oh, that was unpleasant. I'm sorry.

56:48.721 --> 56:51.787
My apologies. <i>Lo siento mucho.</i>

56:51.789 --> 56:54.791
Now, welcome, welcome, welcome.

56:54.793 --> 56:58.494
Feel free, to do anything you want in here.

56:58.496 --> 57:01.498
Before you, you will find in <i>armoire</i>

57:01.500 --> 57:04.767
that is filled with a wide array

57:04.769 --> 57:07.907
of spirits and mixies.

57:09.141 --> 57:11.240
So please.

57:11.242 --> 57:13.075
Live.

57:13.077 --> 57:14.376
Love.

57:14.378 --> 57:19.215
And by love, I mean... fuck.

57:22.521 --> 57:26.155
♪ To do to to to uh ♪

57:26.157 --> 57:29.760

57:29.762 --> 57:33.295

57:33.297 --> 57:35.798
God, he's so cool.

57:35.800 --> 57:37.166
So you guys having fun?

57:37.168 --> 57:39.302
We just saw Rick Ramsey getting a blowjob.

57:39.304 --> 57:42.204
Mm-hmm.

57:42.206 --> 57:43.940
Gotta love the Rick Ram.

57:43.942 --> 57:46.309
We also ran into this cunt that Syd hates.

57:46.311 --> 57:50.412
- Hey, I don't hate her.
- Oh, yes, you do.

57:50.414 --> 57:52.883
Okay, I totally do. But
I don't like saying hate.

57:52.885 --> 57:55.217
You know, I hate the word "Hate."

57:55.219 --> 57:58.021
I hate the word "Cunt." It's
like a punch in the face.

57:58.023 --> 57:59.789
Cunt.

57:59.791 --> 58:01.825
- You hate the word "Hate?"
- Yeah.

58:01.827 --> 58:04.494
There's just so much
negativity in the world.

58:04.496 --> 58:07.363
I don't there's enough of
negativity in the world.

58:07.365 --> 58:09.932
Agreed, if people were
just more honest themselves

58:09.934 --> 58:12.135
they'd realize how awful everyone is.

58:12.137 --> 58:14.271
Y-y-yes, thank you.
Everyone is awful.

58:14.273 --> 58:17.874
No, thank you, Syd, there is beauty

58:17.876 --> 58:20.409
everywhere we turn and
we should acknowledge it.

58:20.411 --> 58:23.915
- Life is beautiful.
- Good one, 1998.

58:24.916 --> 58:26.416
- Be the change.
- What?

58:26.418 --> 58:27.983
Be the change you wanna see in the world

58:27.985 --> 58:29.920
2008, Barack Obama.

58:29.922 --> 58:31.253
Actually, Gandhi.

58:31.255 --> 58:32.956
Yeah, he's cool too.

58:36.094 --> 58:38.164
I want a cigarette.

58:39.597 --> 58:43.266
- You don't smoke.
- Yes, but I want one.

58:43.268 --> 58:46.369
- Okay..
- That actually sounds great.

58:46.371 --> 58:48.405
- I'll go with you.
- We'll stay here.

58:48.407 --> 58:49.942
Alright.

58:58.150 --> 58:59.349
- You want a drink?
- Sure.

58:59.351 --> 59:03.286
Okay, uh, what are we having?

59:03.288 --> 59:05.856
I'll have whatever you're having.

59:05.858 --> 59:07.456
What are you having?

59:07.458 --> 59:08.958
We got some nice scotch.

59:08.960 --> 59:11.161
No, I don't want scotch.

59:11.163 --> 59:13.132
Okay, what do you want?

59:14.632 --> 59:20.170
Um, could you please not drink scotch?

59:20.172 --> 59:22.271
Why?

59:22.273 --> 59:23.874
Because I can't stand when someone's

59:23.876 --> 59:25.878
breath smells like scotch.

59:27.478 --> 59:31.581
Right, because, uh..

59:31.583 --> 59:33.349
Yeah, I thought.

59:33.351 --> 59:36.151
Yeah, I thought so too, I
just didn't wanna assume..

59:36.153 --> 59:37.287
You want to though, right?

59:37.289 --> 59:39.588
Yes, of course, I want to.

59:39.590 --> 59:41.992
Uh. How about beer?

59:41.994 --> 59:43.592
- Beer? Beer is good.
- Perfect.

59:43.594 --> 59:46.162
Beer's great. Beer is perfect.

59:46.164 --> 59:48.164
Thank you.

59:48.166 --> 59:49.499
- Here.
- Hm.

59:49.501 --> 59:50.903
Okay.

59:52.204 --> 59:54.173
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

01:00:16.594 --> 01:00:17.929
Uh..

01:00:18.362 --> 01:00:20.232
Yeah. Uh..

01:00:23.668 --> 01:00:25.235
- Oh.
- You know what?

01:00:25.237 --> 01:00:26.702
- Let's just set these down.
- Yeah.

01:00:26.704 --> 01:00:29.139
Probably a good idea.

01:00:29.141 --> 01:00:31.911
- Okay.
- Hm.

01:00:33.545 --> 01:00:34.978
- Oh.
- Oh. Shit. Hold on.

01:00:34.980 --> 01:00:36.579
- Oh.
- Are you okay?

01:00:36.581 --> 01:00:40.550
Yeah. I just punched myself
in the dick with your knee.

01:00:40.552 --> 01:00:42.318
So, I'm okay.

01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:43.519
- I'm sorry.
- I'm okay.

01:00:43.521 --> 01:00:45.157
- Alright.
- Hm.

01:00:46.992 --> 01:00:48.590
- What..
- Sorry.

01:00:48.592 --> 01:00:51.061
Just that, I need to, I'm really ticklish.

01:00:51.063 --> 01:00:53.095
- Oh, okay.
- No-no-no, sorry.

01:00:53.097 --> 01:00:55.632
- Okay.
- Um.

01:00:55.634 --> 01:00:56.733
You know what?

01:00:56.735 --> 01:01:00.003
- Can you just..
- Okay.

01:01:00.005 --> 01:01:02.438
Oh. Oh, yeah.

01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:03.740
Is this okay?

01:01:03.742 --> 01:01:05.912
For the record, this is always okay.

01:01:11.416 --> 01:01:13.282
This is very tasty.

01:01:13.284 --> 01:01:14.483
You're not inhaling.

01:01:14.485 --> 01:01:15.985
Yes, I am. Look, watch what I do.

01:01:15.987 --> 01:01:17.586
Okay.

01:01:20.224 --> 01:01:22.659
Oh, looks like a lesbian
action here, I'm gonna die.

01:01:22.661 --> 01:01:24.394
Who the fuck is this douchebag?

01:01:24.396 --> 01:01:27.030
Oh no, it's my boss. Act cool.

01:01:27.032 --> 01:01:29.132
You can't get a bucket, I
can thaw it up in a second.

01:01:29.134 --> 01:01:32.068
I think it's impossible for
you to act cool at this point.

01:01:32.070 --> 01:01:33.670
What are you saying? Do I look drunk?

01:01:33.672 --> 01:01:35.104
Yes.

01:01:35.106 --> 01:01:36.539
But it's okay, 'cause I am too.

01:01:36.541 --> 01:01:37.673
So don't feel bad about it.

01:01:37.675 --> 01:01:40.075
That's sweet. You're a good friend.

01:01:41.612 --> 01:01:43.246
- Oh, this guy is your boss?
- Yeah.

01:01:43.248 --> 01:01:47.650
- How old is he?
- He's 25. Just roll with it.

01:01:47.652 --> 01:01:50.653
Maybe if I stand still he won't see me.

01:01:50.655 --> 01:01:52.488
Dave, he's not a T-Rex.

01:01:52.490 --> 01:01:56.159
He was in Sweden for like..

01:01:56.161 --> 01:01:59.561
Davey? Oh, shit.

01:01:59.563 --> 01:02:01.597
Man, if they were letting
people like you into this party

01:02:01.599 --> 01:02:04.266
I probably wouldn't have even shown up.

01:02:04.268 --> 01:02:06.135
- Sorry to disappoint.
- Uh.

01:02:06.137 --> 01:02:07.170
Darren, this is Amy.

01:02:07.172 --> 01:02:09.139
- Charmed.
- Nice.

01:02:09.141 --> 01:02:11.240
So you are knockin' boots with Davy here?

01:02:11.242 --> 01:02:13.443
You know, givin' him some of that fuck.

01:02:13.445 --> 01:02:15.545
No. We just met tonight.

01:02:15.547 --> 01:02:19.148
Oh, thank God, I'm saving
you from a world of regret.

01:02:19.150 --> 01:02:21.050
Better get away from this dork fast.

01:02:21.052 --> 01:02:23.452
- Hey, you gave me 408 yet?
- I just turned it in earlier.

01:02:23.454 --> 01:02:25.054
Doesn't matter, I have to rewrite it

01:02:25.056 --> 01:02:27.590
ten times anyways, yeah, you know.

01:02:27.592 --> 01:02:29.793
Yeah. Where are you from? Where you live?

01:02:29.795 --> 01:02:31.427
Excuse me?

01:02:31.429 --> 01:02:35.264
I'm asking you where you
live to start a conversation.

01:02:35.266 --> 01:02:38.068
Come on. Speed up!

01:02:38.070 --> 01:02:39.601
Don't fuckin' talk to me like that.

01:02:39.603 --> 01:02:42.539
Why? Is it turning you on?

01:02:42.541 --> 01:02:44.441
- Are you for real?
- Okay. Whoa.

01:02:44.443 --> 01:02:48.110
Whoa-whoa-whoa..
Cool you jets, Darren.

01:02:48.112 --> 01:02:50.412
These are not the droids
you are looking for.

01:02:50.414 --> 01:02:51.680
- What?
- These are not the..

01:02:51.682 --> 01:02:53.650
Just, uh, you're being a jerk, okay?

01:02:53.652 --> 01:02:55.485
So just, maybe, you just walk away.

01:02:55.487 --> 01:02:57.854
No-no, fuck that noise.

01:02:57.856 --> 01:02:59.755
Little free advice for you.

01:02:59.757 --> 01:03:01.590
This guy is a sand trap, okay?

01:03:01.592 --> 01:03:04.760
You're gonna just keep swinging
and swinging and swinging

01:03:04.762 --> 01:03:07.597
and the best you'll ever do is par.

01:03:07.599 --> 01:03:09.365
Golf analogy.

01:03:09.367 --> 01:03:10.633
I hate you.

01:03:10.635 --> 01:03:13.436
- I hate you so much.
- You hate me?

01:03:13.438 --> 01:03:15.838
Oh, no, now I've said it
twice. I have to keep goin'.

01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:17.606
Dave, you better shut the fuck up

01:03:17.608 --> 01:03:19.409
before you say something, you can't...

01:03:19.411 --> 01:03:22.512
No. I will not shut the fuck up.

01:03:22.514 --> 01:03:25.215
I'm gonna open the fuck out.

01:03:25.217 --> 01:03:28.284
For starters, you are not nice

01:03:28.286 --> 01:03:31.820
to work for, to hang
out with or to talk to.

01:03:31.822 --> 01:03:33.590
I bet you're not even
nice to your own pets.

01:03:33.592 --> 01:03:36.492
- I don't have any pets.
- See, who doesn't have pets?

01:03:36.494 --> 01:03:37.827
I have a cat and I don't even like cats.

01:03:37.829 --> 01:03:39.496
She has a cat.

01:03:39.498 --> 01:03:42.132
But you don't, Darren.
Because you're a villain.

01:03:42.134 --> 01:03:43.833
You're a villain and an asshole.

01:03:43.835 --> 01:03:45.901
Stop being so dramatic, alright?

01:03:45.903 --> 01:03:47.704
Oh, dramatic? Oh, you want dramatic?

01:03:47.706 --> 01:03:50.139
I'll give you the drama. I quit!

01:03:50.141 --> 01:03:51.807
I don't care, I'll replace
you in five seconds.

01:03:51.809 --> 01:03:53.309
Yeah, I bet you will.

01:03:53.311 --> 01:03:55.744
I bet you will because in this town

01:03:55.746 --> 01:03:57.679
there's always a line
around the block of people

01:03:57.681 --> 01:03:58.914
willing to eat shit.

01:03:58.916 --> 01:04:01.450
But I am done.

01:04:01.452 --> 01:04:04.287
I am tired of eating shit
because now I am full of it.

01:04:04.289 --> 01:04:05.858
I'm full of shit!

01:04:08.425 --> 01:04:12.327
Now get out of here before
I drag you out on the street

01:04:12.329 --> 01:04:15.101
and knock your fuckin' teeth out.

01:04:27.579 --> 01:04:29.579
I can't believe I just did that.

01:04:34.351 --> 01:04:36.686
- What the..
- Um. Um.

01:04:36.688 --> 01:04:37.756
Oh.

01:04:38.389 --> 01:04:39.956
Okay.

01:04:39.958 --> 01:04:42.458
Okay, that didn't work
but I still feel great.

01:04:42.460 --> 01:04:44.193
I just quit my job.

01:04:46.831 --> 01:04:48.134
Party.

01:04:53.637 --> 01:04:56.972
Oh, um, don't undo my bra.

01:04:56.974 --> 01:04:59.374
Uh, oh, okay.

01:04:59.376 --> 01:05:01.778
No, it's not that I'm a prude.

01:05:01.780 --> 01:05:02.815
I just, um..

01:05:05.217 --> 01:05:06.782
I have a huge zit on one of my boobs

01:05:06.784 --> 01:05:09.221
and it makes me look
like I have three nipples.

01:05:10.554 --> 01:05:13.755
Okay, let's, uh, take a break.

01:05:13.757 --> 01:05:16.726
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Okay.

01:05:16.728 --> 01:05:18.931
Let's just take a time out.

01:05:24.402 --> 01:05:26.237
Oh, why isn't this working?

01:05:29.007 --> 01:05:30.840
It should, though.

01:05:30.842 --> 01:05:32.407
- Right?
- Yeah.

01:05:32.409 --> 01:05:34.711
- It totally should.
- It doesn't, though.

01:05:34.713 --> 01:05:36.679
Not at all.

01:05:36.681 --> 01:05:39.518
- It wasn't that bad.
- Um, it wasn't good.

01:05:40.719 --> 01:05:41.751
Fair enough.

01:05:41.753 --> 01:05:43.619
Okay, you know what?

01:05:43.621 --> 01:05:44.720
Let's figure this out.

01:05:44.722 --> 01:05:49.425
Um... why did I make out with you?

01:05:49.427 --> 01:05:51.293
No, wait. Because you're cute.

01:05:51.295 --> 01:05:52.695
And you're funny.

01:05:52.697 --> 01:05:54.030
- Oh, thank you.
- Yeah.

01:05:54.032 --> 01:05:57.769
Okay, you are not boring
and you are very pretty.

01:05:59.471 --> 01:06:00.706
Thank you.

01:06:01.873 --> 01:06:03.505
- It's a compliment.
- Thanks.

01:06:03.507 --> 01:06:06.309
Uh, you are an actor.

01:06:06.311 --> 01:06:07.709
- I'm an actor.
- We have things in common.

01:06:07.711 --> 01:06:09.012
- Exactly.
- Yes.

01:06:09.014 --> 01:06:11.414
Yeah, but it also means
that we seek attention

01:06:11.416 --> 01:06:13.782
and approval from other people.

01:06:13.784 --> 01:06:16.885
Yeah. What's wrong with that?

01:06:16.887 --> 01:06:18.987
We end up making out
on the very first night

01:06:18.989 --> 01:06:20.822
and ignoring all of the red flags that

01:06:20.824 --> 01:06:22.391
ultimately will lead to our relationship

01:06:22.393 --> 01:06:23.695
falling apart in six months.

01:06:25.730 --> 01:06:27.664
Two months.

01:06:27.666 --> 01:06:30.733
- Really?
- Yeah, probably two months.

01:06:30.735 --> 01:06:33.036
Also, you're really
negative and pessimistic.

01:06:33.038 --> 01:06:34.737
Thank you.

01:06:34.739 --> 01:06:37.539
There are so many reasons why
you and I wouldn't work, but

01:06:37.541 --> 01:06:40.842
once again, I ignore them.

01:06:40.844 --> 01:06:42.513
And I just hope for the best.

01:06:45.750 --> 01:06:48.418
Kinda just makes you wanna
give up and stop tryin'.

01:06:48.420 --> 01:06:50.485
No.

01:06:50.487 --> 01:06:51.954
It makes me wanna do
it better the next time

01:06:51.956 --> 01:06:54.557
and actually learn from my mistakes.

01:06:54.559 --> 01:06:58.327
Yeah, we would never work.

01:06:58.329 --> 01:07:00.762
Oh, boy.

01:07:02.599 --> 01:07:05.901
Well, thanks for makin' out with me.

01:07:05.903 --> 01:07:08.539
Oh, hey. You're welcome.

01:07:14.411 --> 01:07:15.778
Yeah, it just doesn't work.

01:07:15.780 --> 01:07:17.112
'Cause it's just like, no.

01:07:17.114 --> 01:07:18.847
- It's bad.
- It's not bad.

01:07:18.849 --> 01:07:20.685
- Isn't this?
- It's just weird.

01:07:22.554 --> 01:07:23.655
Woo.

01:07:25.523 --> 01:07:27.026
Hell of a party, right?

01:07:29.594 --> 01:07:31.494
Maybe we should keep the party goin'.

01:07:31.496 --> 01:07:32.564
No?

01:07:35.032 --> 01:07:36.699
Excuse me?

01:07:36.701 --> 01:07:40.103
Yeah, I've, I got this
wicked bottle of Prosecco

01:07:40.105 --> 01:07:43.740
back at my place, you
know, maybe a little weed..

01:07:43.742 --> 01:07:46.478
I mean, I'm not sure I'd
have to check, but, you know?

01:07:47.411 --> 01:07:49.480
Does this usually work?

01:07:54.018 --> 01:07:55.788
I don't know what I'm doing.

01:07:57.956 --> 01:08:00.555
I, uh..

01:08:00.557 --> 01:08:03.626
I just ended a relationship

01:08:03.628 --> 01:08:06.128
with like the love of my life

01:08:06.130 --> 01:08:07.829
and I'm hanging on by a string.

01:08:07.831 --> 01:08:09.030
- Oh.
- You know?

01:08:09.032 --> 01:08:11.502
Dude, it's okay. You're alright.

01:08:12.771 --> 01:08:14.670
- You're doing fine.
- Yeah?

01:08:14.672 --> 01:08:16.108
Yeah.

01:08:17.975 --> 01:08:19.676
Do you wanna go make out in my car?

01:08:21.412 --> 01:08:23.548
Can you make me happy?

01:08:25.082 --> 01:08:28.051
I think maybe you should
go home and get some sleep.

01:08:30.688 --> 01:08:32.890
- You're probably right.
- Yeah.

01:08:35.059 --> 01:08:36.929
- It was nice meeting you.
- You too.

01:08:38.430 --> 01:08:39.731
Um..

01:08:45.770 --> 01:08:47.836
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:08:47.837 --> 01:08:49.071
Where's Matt?

01:08:49.073 --> 01:08:52.140
- He's coming.
- What happened?

01:08:52.143 --> 01:08:54.810
- We didn't.
- At all?

01:08:54.813 --> 01:08:57.746
- No. It just..
- You didn't?

01:08:57.747 --> 01:08:58.951
Yeah.

01:08:59.951 --> 01:09:01.716
It's okay.

01:09:01.719 --> 01:09:03.819
- Is it?
- Yeah.

01:09:03.822 --> 01:09:05.823
- It's just, uh..
- I know.

01:09:07.591 --> 01:09:10.625
- I love you so much.
- I love you, too.

01:09:10.627 --> 01:09:11.928
- So?
- It's not happening.

01:09:11.930 --> 01:09:13.161
- Okay.
- What about you?

01:09:13.162 --> 01:09:14.867
- Not happening.
- Okay.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:17.933
Ladies and gentlemen.

01:09:17.935 --> 01:09:20.602
May I have your attention please.

01:09:20.604 --> 01:09:24.005
I have an announcement to make.

01:09:24.006 --> 01:09:25.207
Two things.

01:09:25.210 --> 01:09:30.245
One, the police have been called. By me.

01:09:30.247 --> 01:09:33.148
It's a little thing I
like to do to end parties

01:09:33.149 --> 01:09:34.983
'it's a bit of a tradish.'

01:09:34.984 --> 01:09:37.687
Two.

01:09:37.689 --> 01:09:40.121
According to the internet

01:09:40.122 --> 01:09:42.224
this evening in Los Angeles

01:09:42.225 --> 01:09:45.227
it is 68 degrees.

01:09:45.229 --> 01:09:48.531
The perfect weather for a perfect walk.

01:09:48.533 --> 01:09:51.733
Or should I say, hike.

01:09:51.734 --> 01:09:56.041
A night hike!

01:09:57.074 --> 01:09:59.040
Well, we've come this far.

01:10:01.578 --> 01:10:05.647
♪ A-hoo a-hee
a-haa a-ho a-hey.. ♪

01:10:05.649 --> 01:10:09.487

♪ Hikey hikey hikey hike ♪♪

01:10:12.724 --> 01:10:14.523
Alright, let's go.

Shall we join them, <i>mademoiselle?</i>

01:10:17.295 --> 01:10:18.529
Nah.

01:10:20.097 --> 01:10:21.731
I was just kidding.

01:10:21.733 --> 01:10:24.970
Okay, alright. Yeah, yeah, I am.

01:10:40.851 --> 01:10:45.254
- Are these eucalyptus?
- Yeah, eucalyptus.

01:10:45.256 --> 01:10:47.990
I mean, are there koalas in America?

01:10:47.992 --> 01:10:49.625
They are not koalas of America.

01:10:49.627 --> 01:10:51.160
Okay.

01:10:51.162 --> 01:10:54.796
We are about to walk into nature.

01:10:54.798 --> 01:10:57.900
As we do, please, respect
our nocturnal friends

01:10:57.902 --> 01:11:02.170
such as, the owl, the bat, the possum

01:11:02.172 --> 01:11:04.906
the raccoon and the coyote.

01:11:04.908 --> 01:11:07.143
Now, we are entering their homes.

01:11:07.145 --> 01:11:09.879
So please, no littering, contamination

01:11:09.881 --> 01:11:11.813
or general disrespect

01:11:11.815 --> 01:11:14.282
of our mammalian friends.

01:11:14.284 --> 01:11:15.851
What if I have to piss?

01:11:15.853 --> 01:11:17.753
Uh, that's fine. Piss on whatever you want.

01:11:17.755 --> 01:11:18.987
They are animals, they love that.

01:11:18.989 --> 01:11:20.322
- Okay.
- They love piss.

01:11:20.324 --> 01:11:21.592
Now..

01:11:22.260 --> 01:11:24.893
...please, welcome..

01:11:24.895 --> 01:11:26.297
...to Griffith Park.

01:11:27.332 --> 01:11:28.697
I mean, I have to piss so bad.

01:11:28.699 --> 01:11:31.733
I mean, I got to pee bad, man.

01:11:31.735 --> 01:11:34.273
'Welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome.'

01:11:37.140 --> 01:11:38.741
I just think it's a funny story.

01:11:38.743 --> 01:11:41.210
It's not, it's not, it's not funny at all.

01:11:41.212 --> 01:11:42.777
Yes, it is.

01:11:42.779 --> 01:11:45.147
It's funny, 'cause I didn't
know she was homeless.

01:11:45.149 --> 01:11:48.651
Your funny story just
makes you sound predatory

01:11:48.653 --> 01:11:50.686
and it makes you sound stupid.

01:11:50.688 --> 01:11:53.923
See? I think that's hilarious.

01:11:53.925 --> 01:11:55.060
See..

01:11:57.362 --> 01:11:59.661
Why do you have a backpack?

01:11:59.663 --> 01:12:01.567
Oh, it's filled with beer.

01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:06.037
Sam, are you an alcoholic?

01:12:07.171 --> 01:12:09.074
You know, that's entirely possible.

01:12:11.775 --> 01:12:13.174
You want one?

01:12:13.176 --> 01:12:15.311
- Right.
- Right. Okay.

01:12:15.313 --> 01:12:17.079
Gimme one of 'em beers.

01:12:17.081 --> 01:12:19.749
Ugh, these are warm. Gross.

01:12:19.751 --> 01:12:21.250
Matt, stop being such a bitch.

01:12:21.252 --> 01:12:22.287
Give me one.

01:12:26.658 --> 01:12:27.859
Tastes fine to me.

01:12:28.693 --> 01:12:30.058
Will you marry me?

01:12:30.060 --> 01:12:31.360
- Are you on an improv team?
- Yeah.

01:12:31.362 --> 01:12:35.031
- Then, no.
- Fair enough. Smart lady.

01:12:35.033 --> 01:12:39.235
And the thing is, always fun
to tell him off and it was.

01:12:39.237 --> 01:12:42.271
The best part is, I don't
have to do that job anymore.

01:12:42.273 --> 01:12:45.040
I wish I could've seen it.

01:12:45.042 --> 01:12:46.342
It's weird.

01:12:46.344 --> 01:12:50.045
But, I love not knowing what comes next.

01:12:50.047 --> 01:12:52.348
I've never been so excited for the future.

01:12:52.350 --> 01:12:54.086
- I love that feeling.
- Hm.

01:12:56.087 --> 01:12:58.754
Right? Because who knows?

01:12:58.756 --> 01:13:01.057
Anything is possible.

01:13:01.059 --> 01:13:04.059
Bad things will happen
but good stuff will, too.

01:13:04.061 --> 01:13:05.827
For me and for you.

01:13:05.829 --> 01:13:08.998
You could sell a movie in the
next week for a million dollars.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:12.300
I'd have to write one first, but yes.

01:13:12.302 --> 01:13:15.336
Or I could not work for a year, but

01:13:15.338 --> 01:13:17.406
strangely enough, I'm okay with that.

01:13:17.408 --> 01:13:18.808
You should be.

01:13:18.810 --> 01:13:20.076
Because you know what?

01:13:20.078 --> 01:13:21.443
You're gonna be okay.

01:13:21.445 --> 01:13:23.247
No matter what happens.

01:13:24.881 --> 01:13:26.715
So you know

01:13:26.717 --> 01:13:30.085
Syd and Dave are totally
gonna end up dating.

01:13:30.087 --> 01:13:32.153
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

01:13:32.155 --> 01:13:34.423
I saw that coming like a mile away.

01:13:34.425 --> 01:13:38.827
Well, I sure would have
appreciated a heads up.

01:13:38.829 --> 01:13:42.167
Nah, you guys gotta figure
shit out for yourselves.

01:13:43.501 --> 01:13:45.101
Well, I think she's starting to.

01:13:45.103 --> 01:13:47.838
- Mm-hmm.
- Jury's still out on me.

01:13:49.439 --> 01:13:51.240
Have you ever thought
that maybe you should just

01:13:51.242 --> 01:13:54.179
stop whining and realize
that you're doing great?

01:13:57.081 --> 01:13:59.749
Fuck you. Jesus.

01:13:59.751 --> 01:14:00.849
Well, now you're speaking my language.

01:14:00.851 --> 01:14:02.418
- Okay.
- Yeah.

01:14:02.420 --> 01:14:04.186
Seriously though, I want
to punch you in the face

01:14:04.188 --> 01:14:05.854
like a full grown man.

01:14:05.856 --> 01:14:08.857
Wait, are you trying to turn me on?

01:14:08.859 --> 01:14:10.295
Because I think it's working.

01:14:11.962 --> 01:14:14.129
How do you know I'm not
taking you up here to bury you?

01:14:14.131 --> 01:14:15.764
Well, that's what I was hoping this was.

01:14:15.766 --> 01:14:17.933
So, if it's not I'm just gonna..

01:14:17.935 --> 01:14:19.367
- No. No.
- Dude, okay.

01:14:19.369 --> 01:14:21.035
- I'm gonna bury you up here.
- Oh, good.

01:14:21.037 --> 01:14:22.504
But you gotta dig the hole yourself.

01:14:22.506 --> 01:14:25.840
Oh, I, I ain't digging shit.

01:14:25.842 --> 01:14:28.843
Sometime very soon someone will recognize

01:14:28.845 --> 01:14:29.879
one of your many talents.

01:14:29.881 --> 01:14:31.347
Which one?

01:14:31.349 --> 01:14:32.884
I don't know, which one do you want?

01:14:33.850 --> 01:14:36.018
- Acting.
- Great.

01:14:36.020 --> 01:14:38.787
Then you'll be given
the role of a lifetime.

01:14:38.789 --> 01:14:40.388
A role so perfect for you

01:14:40.390 --> 01:14:42.924
that it will solve all of your problems.

01:14:42.926 --> 01:14:45.093
That sounds amazing.

01:14:45.095 --> 01:14:47.062
- Keep going, keep going.
- Alright. Uh, yeah.

01:14:47.064 --> 01:14:51.901
And you will start a charity
that saves puppies lives.

01:14:51.903 --> 01:14:53.803
And gives homeless people homes

01:14:53.805 --> 01:14:56.371
and teaches third world
children to be doctors.

01:14:56.373 --> 01:14:59.474
Oh! I love my new life.

01:14:59.476 --> 01:15:01.278
You're good at this.

01:15:03.814 --> 01:15:07.950
And then you will go on a date with me.

01:15:07.952 --> 01:15:10.852
And it will be the best
date you've ever been on.

01:15:10.854 --> 01:15:12.854
So good that at the end of the evening

01:15:12.856 --> 01:15:14.022
you will ask for my hand in marriage.

01:15:14.024 --> 01:15:15.424
- Of course. Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

01:15:15.426 --> 01:15:18.227
But then after I ask, you'll say no because

01:15:18.229 --> 01:15:22.097
I screwed up and I made out
with your best friend instead.

01:15:22.099 --> 01:15:24.133
And then I'll go into a tailspin
and I'll start collecting

01:15:24.135 --> 01:15:28.603
bottles of my own urine and then
I'll never leave my apartment.

01:15:28.605 --> 01:15:33.342
Okay... but then I will change
my answer when I realize that

01:15:33.344 --> 01:15:35.277
I don't really care that
you made out with Matt

01:15:35.279 --> 01:15:36.579
because a lot of people do that.

01:15:36.581 --> 01:15:39.882
- Oh, gross. Gross.
- And who cares?

01:15:39.884 --> 01:15:43.986
And then you and I will
clean out your apartment

01:15:43.988 --> 01:15:45.220
filled with the urine bottles..

01:15:45.222 --> 01:15:47.356
Mm-hmm,
mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

01:15:47.358 --> 01:15:51.927
And then, we'll get married
and live happily ever after.

01:15:53.064 --> 01:15:54.362
- Sounds like a plan.
- Um.

01:15:59.537 --> 01:16:01.306
I'm serious about that date, though.

01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:04.442
I am, too.

01:16:09.145 --> 01:16:11.146
Fine. I'll admit it.

01:16:11.148 --> 01:16:14.316
- What?
- My life is pretty great.

01:16:14.318 --> 01:16:15.884
See? Was that so hard...

01:16:15.886 --> 01:16:17.518
But it's not great for
the reasons that you think.

01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:21.022
Fuck the whole acting and
the Hollywood bull shit.

01:16:21.024 --> 01:16:23.325
It's great because of nights like this.

01:16:23.327 --> 01:16:26.227
Nights that..

01:16:26.229 --> 01:16:28.232
...sneak up on you when
you really need 'em.

01:16:30.033 --> 01:16:32.468
- That was so corny.
- You're such an asshole.

01:16:32.470 --> 01:16:35.103
- Just really bad.
- Goddamn it.

01:16:35.105 --> 01:16:36.307
I am an asshole.

01:16:39.676 --> 01:16:42.076
You know a girl like
you that's full of, uh..

01:16:42.078 --> 01:16:44.513
...piss and vinegar?

01:16:44.515 --> 01:16:45.917
She's never boring.

01:16:48.618 --> 01:16:51.120
Wow, that might be the, uh..

01:16:51.122 --> 01:16:53.191
...best compliment I've gotten in years.

01:16:54.457 --> 01:16:56.157
You're welcome.

01:16:56.159 --> 01:16:59.061
But I didn't say thank you, so..

01:16:59.063 --> 01:17:01.397
I'll get it out of you soon enough.

01:17:01.399 --> 01:17:04.202
Yeah? I'd like to see you try.

01:17:05.403 --> 01:17:06.605
Shut up.

01:17:08.238 --> 01:17:09.440
Alright.

01:17:22.653 --> 01:17:24.553
Everyone..

01:17:24.555 --> 01:17:27.158
...come here, settle down.

01:17:29.527 --> 01:17:32.393
- How was the walk?
- Oh, it was good.

01:17:32.395 --> 01:17:33.696
Yeah. It was a good walk.

01:17:33.698 --> 01:17:35.464
Yeah?

01:17:35.466 --> 01:17:37.936
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:17:38.469 --> 01:17:40.005
Look.

01:17:41.706 --> 01:17:43.909
Gaze upon the horizon.

01:17:45.443 --> 01:17:48.410
Thousands, if not millions of lights

01:17:48.412 --> 01:17:52.050
some twinkling, some, steadfast.

01:17:53.016 --> 01:17:55.150
Each one a dream..

01:17:55.152 --> 01:17:57.186
..most of which..

01:17:57.188 --> 01:17:59.524
...will never come true.

01:18:01.658 --> 01:18:03.228
But..

01:18:05.229 --> 01:18:07.763
...that is not

01:18:07.765 --> 01:18:11.633
success or failure in one's life!

01:18:11.635 --> 01:18:16.504
The only true measure
of success in one's life

01:18:16.506 --> 01:18:20.642
is the pursuit of your dreams!

01:18:20.644 --> 01:18:23.344
If you live free

01:18:23.346 --> 01:18:28.683
amidst chaos and blindly pursue said dreams

01:18:28.685 --> 01:18:31.285
then you have succeeded!

01:18:31.287 --> 01:18:35.391
And that is all that matters!

01:18:35.393 --> 01:18:39.061
Pursue! Pursue!

01:18:39.063 --> 01:18:41.432
Pursue!

01:18:44.100 --> 01:18:46.035
Now..

01:18:46.037 --> 01:18:49.204
...I'm going to take a piss
in that bush over there.

01:18:49.206 --> 01:18:52.644
Nobody watch me or else I, I can't go.

01:18:59.082 --> 01:19:00.315
Did that just fucking happen?

01:19:00.317 --> 01:19:01.517
- Yeah.
- Yes, it did.

01:19:01.519 --> 01:19:03.085
It happens all the time.

01:19:03.087 --> 01:19:05.490
- Like how often?
- So often.

01:19:11.561 --> 01:19:15.196
I wonder how many of those
people are having sex right now.

01:19:15.198 --> 01:19:16.567
I love that movie.

01:19:18.469 --> 01:19:21.736
At this moment, people
are having lunch in Paris.

01:19:21.738 --> 01:19:25.507
Well, it's five o'clock somewhere.

01:19:25.509 --> 01:19:28.544
If we were farmers, we
would be waking up right now.

01:19:28.546 --> 01:19:31.080
To milk the cows.

01:19:31.082 --> 01:19:33.514
And feed the chickens.

01:19:33.516 --> 01:19:36.117
And churn the butter.

01:19:36.119 --> 01:19:38.387
That actually sounds kind of nice.

01:19:38.389 --> 01:19:39.591
It does.

01:19:40.858 --> 01:19:43.092
I wish we were farmers.

01:19:43.094 --> 01:19:46.195
Yeah, let's buy a farm.

01:19:51.135 --> 01:19:54.769
Fuck you, Los Angeles!

01:19:56.739 --> 01:19:58.206
Hey, LA

01:19:58.208 --> 01:20:01.110
why don't you go fuck yourself, man?

01:20:01.112 --> 01:20:04.745
Yeah, fuck you, Los Angeles!

01:20:04.747 --> 01:20:08.517
I fucking hate you sometimes, Los Angeles!

01:20:08.519 --> 01:20:11.586
- Suck a dick, LA!
- Yeah!

01:20:11.588 --> 01:20:13.589
Suck her dick, LA!

01:20:15.326 --> 01:20:17.659
Yeah, it's right here!

01:20:19.697 --> 01:20:22.363
Suck his dick, suck his dick..

01:20:29.606 --> 01:20:31.373
Yeah, you can do a jump like that.

01:20:31.375 --> 01:20:32.773
It's one thing if you've got it
better, 'cause mine is better.

01:20:32.775 --> 01:20:34.276
'Cause I go "thank you so much!"

01:20:34.278 --> 01:20:36.245
No, no, no, no, I jump in the air

01:20:36.247 --> 01:20:37.478
and I sweep down and then stoop.

01:20:37.480 --> 01:20:38.813
I don't know, man, just say

01:20:38.815 --> 01:20:41.183
"oh, thank you so much!"

01:20:41.185 --> 01:20:43.384
No, man, that's not smooth at all.

01:20:43.386 --> 01:20:45.353
Look at you, you fucking idiot.

01:20:45.355 --> 01:20:47.688
You dropped your fucking flashlight.

01:20:57.635 --> 01:21:01.269
So you two, you know, you guys,
guys are room-mates or anything?

01:21:01.271 --> 01:21:02.771
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:21:02.773 --> 01:21:04.505
That's pretty cool.

01:21:04.507 --> 01:21:07.509
Do you, do you have a place to
get your haircut around town?

01:21:07.511 --> 01:21:08.777
Like you got a, a guy?

01:21:08.779 --> 01:21:10.478
Um, I-I'm a model.

01:21:10.480 --> 01:21:11.812
- So, I kinda..
- Yeah.

01:21:11.814 --> 01:21:14.316
- Have it done on set or...
- I knew that.

01:21:14.318 --> 01:21:15.884
You-you have it done
on set? That's awesome.

01:21:15.886 --> 01:21:17.619
- Like a free haircut.
- Hm.

01:21:17.621 --> 01:21:19.921
I go to, I go to, like, like "Hair Cuttery"

01:21:19.923 --> 01:21:22.191
or "Fantastic Sam" sometimes.

01:21:38.775 --> 01:21:40.875
So I get a call from the police

01:21:40.877 --> 01:21:42.878
from Sonoma, California.

01:21:42.880 --> 01:21:46.248
They've found my car in a
grocery store parking lot.

01:21:46.250 --> 01:21:49.750
I take a train, for nine
and half hours to Sonoma

01:21:49.752 --> 01:21:53.321
and get drunk at a winery with
a bus load of Swedish people.

01:21:53.323 --> 01:21:55.357
Two of whom were 40 year old divorcees

01:21:55.359 --> 01:21:57.459
that I end up having..

01:21:57.461 --> 01:22:01.166
...dinner with, it was
nice. The end of the story.

01:22:02.865 --> 01:22:06.768
Did you have a threesome
with two old ladies?

01:22:06.770 --> 01:22:09.638
Older ladies? Yes, yes I did.

01:22:09.640 --> 01:22:11.373
- Oh!
- Uh..

01:22:11.375 --> 01:22:14.576
- Why did you tell that story?
- Because I'm stupid.

01:22:16.479 --> 01:22:19.481
- Yeah.
- You're good at this.

01:22:19.483 --> 01:22:21.250
Oh, my God.

01:22:21.252 --> 01:22:24.518
You guys, look. Guys, look.

01:22:24.520 --> 01:22:26.888
I can't believe you said that.

01:22:26.890 --> 01:22:30.625
My sister is in a wheelchair!

01:22:30.627 --> 01:22:34.562
Okay, I'm sorry!

01:22:34.564 --> 01:22:37.699
It's not a believable thing that I said.

01:22:37.701 --> 01:22:39.668
It was a joke.

01:22:39.670 --> 01:22:42.704
Why don't you get off
your fucking high horse

01:22:42.706 --> 01:22:45.040
and get into your own horse?

01:22:45.042 --> 01:22:48.910
You fucking whores!

01:22:48.912 --> 01:22:51.312
You look like a fucking old grandmother!

01:22:51.314 --> 01:22:52.546
What was that?

01:22:52.548 --> 01:22:54.383
Say it to my damn face!

01:22:54.385 --> 01:22:56.684
You look like my nana!

01:22:56.686 --> 01:22:59.987
Well, your nana had pretty sweet moves.

01:22:59.989 --> 01:23:03.325
'Cause I got sweet moves!

01:23:03.327 --> 01:23:04.925
'Get out of my way, man!'

01:23:04.927 --> 01:23:07.495
I'll fight. I know karate.

01:23:07.497 --> 01:23:09.666
Eat a dick for dinner, dude!

01:23:11.435 --> 01:23:12.637
Fuck!

01:23:18.542 --> 01:23:19.744
I love you guys.

01:23:20.711 --> 01:23:21.779
Duh.

01:23:24.948 --> 01:23:26.951
Oh, my God! Food, dope!

01:23:31.488 --> 01:23:33.522
Oh, my God!

01:23:33.524 --> 01:23:35.991
Are we in the fucking Valley?

01:23:35.993 --> 01:23:37.858
Oh, God, I remember those days.

01:23:37.860 --> 01:23:38.893
- Hmm.
- Uh-huh.

01:23:38.895 --> 01:23:40.331
I'll be right back.

01:23:53.344 --> 01:23:54.742
Your jacket, sir.

01:23:54.744 --> 01:23:57.044
Uh..

01:23:57.046 --> 01:23:59.613
- 'Cause that's how we roll.
- Mm-hmm.

01:23:59.615 --> 01:24:00.652
Mm-hmm.

01:24:03.386 --> 01:24:04.852
Ladies and gents

01:24:04.854 --> 01:24:07.054
breakfast is on me.

01:24:07.056 --> 01:24:08.790
