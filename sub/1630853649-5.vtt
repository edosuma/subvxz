hasn't reached human trials.

13:58.296 --> 13:59.673
Well, what if it has?

14:01.967 --> 14:04.302
What if it was used
on a platoon of Navy SEALs

ago and never came back?

Why did Horn come after you?

29:04.493 --> 29:07.204
RD-4895 was an experimental drug

29:07.204 --> 29:09.957
developed by
Nubellum Pharmaceuticals.

29:09.957 --> 29:13.711
Its goal was to stop
the encoding of trauma

29:13.711 --> 29:17.256
on the brain,
effectively preventing PTSD.

29:17.256 --> 29:20.217
It worked in rats,
it worked in dogs,

29:20.217 --> 29:22.219
and then Horn rushed it
into humans.

29:23.262 --> 29:24.847
And it gave us brain tumors.

29:24.847 --> 29:26.849
If RD-4895 works,

29:26.849 --> 29:28.476
Nubellum Pharmaceuticals
is one of

29:28.476 --> 29:30.644

in the world.

29:44.575 --> 29:46.577
out of his shares in Nubellum

29:46.577 --> 29:49.413
