00:02.140 --> 00:03.969
<i>Previously on
"The Rookie: Feds"...</i>

00:04.107 --> 00:05.453
He did work counterintelligence

00:05.591 --> 00:06.868
for a decade before he
came out to Los Angeles.

00:07.007 --> 00:08.732
Just asked for the best
investigator they had.

00:08.870 --> 00:10.148
Well, you got him.

00:10.286 --> 00:12.633
We're professionals who break
guys like you for a living.

00:12.771 --> 00:14.600
And if you think
the Russians have your back,

00:14.738 --> 00:16.223
you are hopelessly naive.

00:16.361 --> 00:20.434
The reason I-I haven't opened
the bottle is because I'm sober.

00:20.572 --> 00:22.160
247 days.

00:22.298 --> 00:23.851
Thank you for
sharing that with me.

00:23.989 --> 00:26.371
I lateral transferred
from Oakland PD six months ago,

00:26.509 --> 00:29.305
and I gotta say, I'm still not
vibing with the "LA thing."

00:29.443 --> 00:32.032
You just haven't given
the right people a try.

00:32.170 --> 00:33.688
Once you find your folks,

00:33.826 --> 00:35.759
you gonna see LA
through different eyes.

00:36.864 --> 00:38.969
♪ Coming out, do it right ♪

00:39.108 --> 00:41.144
Hey, girl. Hey.
Sorry I'm late.

00:41.282 --> 00:43.215
All good.
I already ordered.

00:43.353 --> 00:45.493
Did you over-sleep?
Hell, no.

00:45.631 --> 00:48.324
I've been up since
the crack of black, okay?

00:48.462 --> 00:50.602
I lost track of time
reading case files.

00:50.740 --> 00:51.741
Hi, sweetie.

00:51.879 --> 00:54.019
Can I have
a black rice bowl

00:54.157 --> 00:55.296
with the dressing
on the side,

00:55.434 --> 00:57.402
egg whites,
extra fluffy,

00:57.540 --> 01:00.853
uh, immune-booster coffee
with two shots of espresso?

01:00.991 --> 01:02.234
Thank you.

01:02.372 --> 01:03.891
What?

01:04.029 --> 01:05.375
That's the most bougie
breakfast order

01:05.513 --> 01:06.928
I've ever heard.
Let me guess.

01:07.067 --> 01:10.553
You ordered an egg sandwich
with extra cholesterol?

01:10.691 --> 01:13.176
And I'm excited to eat it.

01:13.314 --> 01:14.384
You working
a big investigation--

01:14.522 --> 01:15.730
all those case files?

01:15.868 --> 01:17.698
Oh, no.
Those are slow burners.

01:17.836 --> 01:20.183
I just like to soak up
as much knowledge as I can

01:20.321 --> 01:22.910
about any open case
I can get my hands on.

01:23.048 --> 01:24.877
Gotta keep the Black girl magic going.

01:25.015 --> 01:26.569
You know what
your problem is?

01:26.707 --> 01:29.227
You got your co-workers thinking
you're a Black superhero.

01:29.365 --> 01:30.745
And?
And you're not.

01:30.883 --> 01:33.023
You're 50 years old--48, thank you.

01:33.162 --> 01:35.612
And you're doing too much.

01:36.337 --> 01:37.511
Aren't you tired?

01:39.237 --> 01:40.755
I'm exhausted.

01:40.893 --> 01:43.413
But I've worked so hard
and come so far,

01:43.551 --> 01:46.036
I can't take my foot
off the gas now.

01:46.175 --> 01:48.453
Where did you
come from?

01:48.591 --> 01:51.249
This is-- This is blood.

01:51.387 --> 01:53.906
Whose dog is this?

01:54.044 --> 01:55.943
H-H-Hold on.

01:56.081 --> 01:58.773
Ma'am, looks like you fell
and hit your head.

01:58.911 --> 02:00.672
- Are you all right?
- I got jumped.

02:00.810 --> 02:02.570
Did they rob you?

02:02.708 --> 02:04.952
All my clients' keys.

02:05.090 --> 02:06.574
They could be robbing
their houses right now.

02:06.712 --> 02:08.749
We're gonna need a list
of names and addresses.

02:08.887 --> 02:11.959
We're gonna need to get units
to all those houses ASAP.

02:12.097 --> 02:13.374
This isn't a federal case, Simone.

02:13.512 --> 02:15.169
It's LAPD,
and I got it.

02:15.307 --> 02:18.448
If you think I'm gonna walk away
while you run towards danger,

02:18.586 --> 02:20.312
you don't know me
at all.

02:20.450 --> 02:22.763
Now, get some backup down here
and an ambulance for this girl

02:22.901 --> 02:24.972
so we can go
run these guys down.

02:25.110 --> 02:26.905
- Damn.
- What is it that you
think I'm doing?

02:27.043 --> 02:28.458
Calling the nail salon?

02:29.597 --> 02:32.635
♪ Ah ah, ah ah, ah-ah-ah-ah ♪

02:32.773 --> 02:34.568
♪ Ah ah, ah ah, ah-ah-ah ♪

02:36.604 --> 02:38.779
Did you see
the breaking news?

02:38.917 --> 02:40.125
Uh, what?

02:40.263 --> 02:41.920
Quite the scandal.

02:42.058 --> 02:43.887
Last night,
this man stayed over

02:44.025 --> 02:45.751
at his girlfriend's house.

02:45.889 --> 02:47.236
They had...

02:47.374 --> 02:49.065
quite the romantic evening.

02:49.203 --> 02:50.653
But when she woke up,

02:50.791 --> 02:52.724
instead of getting
breakfast in bed,

02:52.862 --> 02:54.277
he was gone.

02:54.415 --> 02:58.281
No note, no text, no call.

02:58.419 --> 03:01.733
He ghosted her as if they don't
work in the same building.

03:01.871 --> 03:03.010
I'm sorry.

03:03.148 --> 03:04.529
After you fell asleep,
I, uh--

03:04.667 --> 03:06.289
I got a phone call
from Michelle.

03:06.427 --> 03:09.499
So a woman I've never heard of
got you out of my bed.

03:09.637 --> 03:10.949
No. N--
This isn't helping.

03:11.087 --> 03:13.296
Michelle is, uh...

03:13.434 --> 03:15.816
my-- my sponsor's wife.

03:15.954 --> 03:19.475
Randy didn't show up last night,
so I, uh...

03:19.613 --> 03:23.375
went out to go look for him
and found him in a dive bar--

03:23.513 --> 03:24.721
hammered.

03:24.859 --> 03:26.689
Your sponsor. Oh, no.

03:26.827 --> 03:30.279
Decade of sobriety, back to
counting days instead of years.

03:30.417 --> 03:32.039
I'm so sorry.
It's okay.

03:32.177 --> 03:33.730
Where is he now?

03:33.868 --> 03:35.870
Uh, he's--
he's home safe, drying out.

03:36.008 --> 03:38.079
Do you want to take a walk, talk?

03:38.218 --> 03:41.807
No, i-it's okay.
I'm-- I'm-- I'm fine.

03:41.945 --> 03:44.189
Actually, uh, I need to--

03:44.327 --> 03:45.570
I'll talk to you later?

03:45.708 --> 03:46.916
Of course.

03:47.813 --> 03:49.401
It's been four months

03:49.539 --> 03:51.231
since Simone and Brendon
joined our operation,

03:51.369 --> 03:53.025
and I want to commend
the both of you

03:53.163 --> 03:54.303
for getting them
to this point.

03:54.441 --> 03:56.063
I-I appreciate that, Matt,

03:56.201 --> 03:58.238
considering I had a tougher
assignment with Simone.

03:58.376 --> 03:59.515
Excuse me?

03:59.653 --> 04:02.069
I have been turning
a former TV star meat puppet

04:02.207 --> 04:03.381
into a solid field agent.

04:03.519 --> 04:04.727
My job is way tougher.

04:04.865 --> 04:06.660
At least actors
can follow directions.

04:06.798 --> 04:09.594
Do you know how hard I've had
to work to break a wild horse?

04:09.732 --> 04:12.424
Especially one who constantly
reminds you she's Black Beauty?

04:12.562 --> 04:14.046
- Yes, Brendon?
- Hey.

04:14.184 --> 04:15.600
Uh, am I supposed to be
in here?

04:15.738 --> 04:16.911
You guys keep looking out
at me.

04:17.049 --> 04:19.397
Hey, is that my file?
And Simone's?

04:19.535 --> 04:22.607
We were just finishing up
a Senior Briefing, Brendon.

04:22.745 --> 04:23.987
Oh, sorry.

04:24.125 --> 04:25.506
Where is Simone?

04:25.644 --> 04:26.783
Uh, I have no idea.

04:26.921 --> 04:28.578
Oh, I see Carter
hasn't been teaching

04:28.716 --> 04:30.062
his trainee
about punctuality.

04:30.200 --> 04:31.167
Oh.

04:31.305 --> 04:32.720
Speaking of.

04:32.858 --> 04:35.275
Simone, we were
just talking about you.

04:35.413 --> 04:37.277
- Because you're late.
- <i>Sorry, boss,</i>

04:37.415 --> 04:41.246
<i>but I kinda got caught up
in an international incident.</i>

04:42.834 --> 04:45.112
This better be good, Simone.

04:45.250 --> 04:46.389
It is.

04:46.527 --> 04:49.254
A dog walker was assaulted
by two robbers

04:49.392 --> 04:52.740
looking to gain access
to her rich clients' homes.

04:52.878 --> 04:55.640
Now, before LAPD
could mobilize,

04:55.778 --> 04:57.987
two of the houses
were already ransacked.

04:58.125 --> 05:00.748
One of them belonged
to Viktar Saroka,

05:00.886 --> 05:03.613
Consul General of
the Republic of Belarus.

05:03.751 --> 05:06.927
A burglary of a dignitary's home
isn't a great look for LA,

05:07.065 --> 05:09.723
but what elevates it
to an international incident?

05:09.861 --> 05:11.345
Wait for it.

05:13.382 --> 05:15.591
Okay, freeze and zoom in.

05:15.729 --> 05:16.833
Boom.

05:16.971 --> 05:18.663
They stole
a diplomatic pouch.

05:18.801 --> 05:20.665
All right, I need to reach out
to the Consulate right away.

05:20.803 --> 05:22.149
Already did.
They're sending someone.

05:22.287 --> 05:23.392
How about
the State Department?

05:23.530 --> 05:24.945
Oh,
I didn't call them.

05:25.083 --> 05:26.636
Those guys are even more uptight
than the FBI.

05:26.774 --> 05:28.742
- Mm.
- I left that conversation
to you.

05:28.880 --> 05:30.053
Oh, thanks.

05:35.265 --> 05:36.922
Rada.

05:37.060 --> 05:39.753
I was not aware that you were
stationed here in Los Angeles.

05:39.891 --> 05:41.824
Secretary Consul,
two months now.

05:41.962 --> 05:44.792
Rada Rybak, meet Special Agents
Carter Hope, Simone Clark,

05:44.930 --> 05:46.311
and this is
Detective Naomi Voss.

05:46.449 --> 05:47.795
Are you the homeowner,
ma'am?

05:47.933 --> 05:50.142
No, it's Consul General
and his family's mansion.

05:50.280 --> 05:52.248
He sent me
on his behalf.

05:52.386 --> 05:54.250
Um, you, uh...

05:54.388 --> 05:55.320
didn't go inside,
did you?

05:55.458 --> 05:56.494
We had to.

05:56.632 --> 05:59.289
Robbery suspects
had assaulted a woman.

05:59.428 --> 06:02.223
We made entry to make sure there
wasn't anyone else in distress.

06:02.362 --> 06:03.846
Yeah, and we found out
that they took

06:03.984 --> 06:05.365
a lot of
the family's property.

06:05.503 --> 06:08.333
Including
a diplomatic pouch.

06:09.748 --> 06:12.510
- That's bad.
- Which is why the FBI
is already involved.

06:12.648 --> 06:14.684
- Any idea of what was in it?
- None.

06:14.822 --> 06:16.203
Well, if you knew,
would you tell us?

06:16.341 --> 06:20.380
Diplomatic pouches are
as sovereign as our Consulate.

06:20.518 --> 06:23.693
Belarus business only.
I'm prohibited from sharing.

06:23.831 --> 06:25.557
What about the Consul General?
Would he tell us?

06:25.695 --> 06:27.076
I doubt it.

06:27.214 --> 06:29.906
And he's busy getting ready
for a state dinner.

06:30.044 --> 06:31.391
Still, we need to ask.

06:31.529 --> 06:32.909
It's in both our country's
best interest

06:33.047 --> 06:34.255
to get that pouch
back to you.

06:34.394 --> 06:35.567
And if we know
what's inside of it,

06:35.705 --> 06:37.189
then that'll help us target

06:37.327 --> 06:39.088
where the thieves might try
and sell it, so...

06:39.226 --> 06:42.678
And I'm supposed to trust
that you won't take any pictures

06:42.816 --> 06:45.059
of what's inside
before you hand it over?

06:45.197 --> 06:48.062
Rada, honey,
nobody's trying to play you.

06:48.200 --> 06:50.375
All we want to do
is catch these guys

06:50.513 --> 06:53.205
and get your country's
confidential materials back.

06:53.343 --> 06:54.621
That's all.

06:55.829 --> 06:57.555
I'll see what I can do.

06:57.693 --> 06:59.211
Now,
if you'll excuse me.

06:59.349 --> 07:01.282
Of course.

07:02.352 --> 07:04.907
- How do you know her?
- From my
counterintelligence days.

07:05.045 --> 07:08.911
She may be a diplomat right now,
but once a spy, always a spy.

07:09.049 --> 07:11.672
- So we can't trust her?
- Trust her?

07:11.810 --> 07:13.467
Simone, that woman
is the second in command

07:13.605 --> 07:15.607
of a consulate for a bleak
and volatile country

07:15.745 --> 07:18.783
that has been at war with itself
since its independence.

07:18.921 --> 07:22.062
With these comrades,
we trust no one.

07:22.200 --> 07:24.409
I appreciate you meeting
with us, Mr. Consul General.

07:24.547 --> 07:28.551
You can appreciate all you want,
but I cannot help you.

07:28.689 --> 07:30.864
Mr. Saroka, we're here
in the interests of diplomacy.

07:31.002 --> 07:32.279
Whatever was
in that pouch

07:32.417 --> 07:33.763
is of great importance
to your country.

07:33.901 --> 07:35.385
So just let us
help you get it back.

07:35.524 --> 07:36.766
Unless there was something
in the pouch

07:36.904 --> 07:38.078
you don't want to disclose.

07:38.216 --> 07:41.391
I confess.
It's nuclear launch codes--

07:41.530 --> 07:45.741
a list of American spies,
and the Holy Grail.

07:45.879 --> 07:48.260
Holy Grail. Yeah.

07:48.398 --> 07:50.262
That's funny.

07:50.400 --> 07:53.507
But, uh, Mr. Consul General,
I can assure you

07:53.645 --> 07:55.751
we are only trying to help you
get your pouch back.

07:55.889 --> 07:57.235
There's no ulterior motives here.

07:57.373 --> 07:58.823
Now I know
you're lying.

07:58.961 --> 08:00.790
You think I haven't been
briefed about you?

08:00.928 --> 08:02.102
I'm no longer
in counterintelligence,

08:02.240 --> 08:04.207
but I respect the suspicion.

08:04.345 --> 08:05.485
Here's my card.

08:05.623 --> 08:07.003
You call if you
change your mind.

08:07.141 --> 08:08.798
And if you don't,
we'll contact you

08:08.936 --> 08:10.144
once the burglars
have been caught

08:10.282 --> 08:11.939
and your property
has been returned.

08:18.877 --> 08:20.810
Nice touch
with the Russian.

08:20.948 --> 08:22.156
You think he's just
being a diplomat,

08:22.294 --> 08:24.262
or is he actually
hiding something?

08:24.400 --> 08:26.091
Both.

08:44.627 --> 08:46.526
Find him!

08:46.664 --> 08:49.805
And find the pouch
before FBI does.

08:49.943 --> 08:52.497
Hey, any luck
tracing that van?

08:52.635 --> 08:54.395
Managed to track it through the
street cameras for half a mile,

08:54.534 --> 08:56.570
but then I lost it in
the Mid-Wilshire dead zone.

08:56.708 --> 08:59.366
But I got enough angles
to create a 3-D rendering

08:59.504 --> 09:02.576
and identify it
as a 2009 Econoline.

09:02.714 --> 09:04.474
System's currently
using a program I created

09:04.613 --> 09:06.511
to match the dents and dings
to other footage of the vehicle

09:06.649 --> 09:09.410
captured within
the last few weeks.

09:09.549 --> 09:12.552
It feels like you want me
- to be impressed by this.
- Are you?

09:12.690 --> 09:15.175
- Only results impress me.
- Right?

09:15.313 --> 09:17.902
So, uh, if there's any way
I'm coming up short,

09:18.040 --> 09:19.386
just let me know.
Oh, okay.

09:19.524 --> 09:20.732
You think I've been
holding back?

09:20.870 --> 09:23.183
Your criticism's
usually very...

09:23.321 --> 09:24.667
constructive.

09:24.805 --> 09:26.876
Okay. What--
What is going on with you?

09:27.014 --> 09:29.154
You're even more emo
than usual.

09:29.292 --> 09:30.880
Nothing. Just--

09:31.018 --> 09:32.192
Oh, wait.
What's this?

09:32.330 --> 09:33.642
Oh, my God.
There it is.

09:33.780 --> 09:35.367
Six sightings of the van
in the last three weeks,

09:35.505 --> 09:36.886
four with license plates.

09:37.024 --> 09:40.683
Okay, so if I just type
in the information right here.

09:40.821 --> 09:42.512
There he is.
Owner of the van--

09:42.651 --> 09:45.032
Trip Madsen, 6247 Sycamore,
in Hollywood.

09:45.170 --> 09:46.551
Now I'm impressed.

09:46.689 --> 09:48.691
All right, call in
for a telephonic warrant.

09:54.352 --> 09:57.044
FBI, open up!
We have a warrant!

10:09.332 --> 10:10.644
Check it out.

10:10.782 --> 10:12.025
Looks like the stuff
they stole this morning.

10:12.163 --> 10:14.027
No diplomatic pouch.

10:15.338 --> 10:16.892
What the--

10:17.030 --> 10:18.928
Okay, we'll take the roof.
You cover the street.

10:31.769 --> 10:32.908
What was that?

10:36.670 --> 10:37.809
That way.
Go, go, go.

10:40.398 --> 10:41.779
He must have
jumped down there.

10:41.917 --> 10:43.332
Simone,
suspect's on the loose,

10:43.470 --> 10:45.990
most likely escaping through
the building to our east.

10:48.613 --> 10:50.477
No suspects in sight.

10:50.615 --> 10:52.582
We got two on the ground

10:52.721 --> 10:56.725
and I can identify one
as the van driver.

10:56.863 --> 10:59.244
Nothing personal,

10:59.382 --> 11:00.798
but next time you invite me
to breakfast,

11:00.936 --> 11:02.696
I'm saying no.

11:05.941 --> 11:08.771
No sign
of the diplomatic pouch.

11:08.909 --> 11:10.946
Killers must have
taken it with them.

11:11.084 --> 11:12.775
Killers, plural?

11:12.913 --> 11:14.915
No way one person could get
two people off the roof

11:15.053 --> 11:16.745
against their will,
even at gunpoint.

11:16.883 --> 11:19.471
And look, this looks
like a mini photo studio.

11:19.609 --> 11:20.921
Probably to take pics
of the stuff

11:21.059 --> 11:22.336
they steal to sell online.

11:22.474 --> 11:24.097
Maybe they took photos
of what was in the pouch

11:24.235 --> 11:26.030
- before they killed them.
- But I don't see any cameras.

11:26.168 --> 11:27.341
The photos must be
on their phones.

11:27.479 --> 11:30.620
Let's pray they survived
the eight-story fall.

11:32.830 --> 11:34.141
Reach out to Nazar.

11:34.279 --> 11:36.730
Tell him we tracked down
the diplomatic pouch.

11:36.868 --> 11:39.664
We're back in business,
but we have to work fast.

11:53.022 --> 11:54.299
What the hell
are you doing?

11:54.437 --> 11:55.645
Give it to me.

11:57.924 --> 11:59.511
Let go of me.

11:59.649 --> 12:01.686
I'll tell my father
to have you killed.

12:09.521 --> 12:11.144
Don't. Don't.

12:17.150 --> 12:18.738
Are you insane?

12:18.876 --> 12:20.532
They love me in Belarus.

12:20.670 --> 12:22.189
Why am I not surprised?

12:22.327 --> 12:24.157
I mean, "Vampire Cop"
was number one there for--

12:24.295 --> 12:26.262
All right, did you get either
of these phones to work or what?

12:26.400 --> 12:28.161
Uh, no, not yet.
Yeah, Brendon
was just telling me

12:28.299 --> 12:29.645
how popular he is
in Belarus.

12:29.783 --> 12:31.578
Why am I not surprised?

12:31.716 --> 12:33.166
Oh, here we go.

12:33.304 --> 12:35.271
Uh, most of the files
are corrupted,

12:35.409 --> 12:36.997
except for
recent photos.

12:37.135 --> 12:38.550
Oh,
they seem like fun.

12:38.688 --> 12:39.724
Wait, wait.
Hang on, hang on.

12:39.862 --> 12:40.932
There it is.

12:41.070 --> 12:43.210
Those are currency plates.

12:43.348 --> 12:44.487
For a $20 bill.

12:50.355 --> 12:53.531
How are you
so epically stupid?

12:53.669 --> 12:54.670
Dad...

12:58.260 --> 13:00.193
I'm walking
a razor's edge.

13:00.331 --> 13:03.852
There are those back home who
think I'm not hardline enough.

13:03.990 --> 13:06.233
They're sharpening
their knives,

13:06.371 --> 13:08.270
hoping for me
to slip up.

13:08.408 --> 13:11.998
They even put an enemy
in beside me.

13:12.653 --> 13:15.208
And you...

13:15.346 --> 13:17.589
my own son,

13:17.727 --> 13:20.938
you constantly enlarge
the target on my back.

13:21.076 --> 13:23.388
I'm trying to help the family,
not hurt it.

13:23.526 --> 13:24.665
I don't understand
why you don't have

13:24.804 --> 13:26.564
this Boogeyman
put Rada in the ocean.

13:26.702 --> 13:28.738
Enough.

13:28.877 --> 13:30.913
Whatever
you're up to stops.

13:31.983 --> 13:36.574
And if not, I'll send you
to join the infantry in Vitebsk!

13:36.712 --> 13:38.818
Understood?!

13:40.233 --> 13:41.717
The good news is the plates
are counterfeit,

13:41.855 --> 13:43.236
but they are
damn fine ones.

13:43.374 --> 13:44.582
How can you tell?

13:44.720 --> 13:45.894
You see that little hint
of green right there

13:46.032 --> 13:46.895
in the metal's coloring?

13:47.033 --> 13:47.999
That's copper.

13:48.137 --> 13:49.863
U.S. currency plates--
zero copper.

13:50.001 --> 13:51.692
Why would you smuggle a plate
into the United States?

13:51.831 --> 13:54.281
Wouldn't it be safer to bang out
$20 bills in Belarus?

13:54.419 --> 13:57.077
Actually, Belarus is known
for going medieval on criminals.

13:57.215 --> 14:00.770
Los Angeles is the world's
capital for forging.

14:00.909 --> 14:03.428
They will get much
better quality bills here.

14:03.566 --> 14:05.603
There's something
not tracking for me here.

14:05.741 --> 14:07.743
Corruption is rampant in
Belarus-- that's a given.

14:07.881 --> 14:09.883
But counterfeiting
U.S. currency,

14:10.021 --> 14:11.885
that's a fast track
to sanctions and more.

14:12.023 --> 14:14.646
- Why would Viktar risk it?
- Maybe he's not involved.

14:14.784 --> 14:16.338
I just don't think
we have enough information

14:16.476 --> 14:18.271
to speculate yet.

14:18.409 --> 14:19.617
Where you headed, boss?

14:19.755 --> 14:22.102
To have a clandestine conversation.

14:26.003 --> 14:28.591
Going old school
with that newspaper, hm?

14:28.729 --> 14:31.146
I couldn't resist.

14:31.284 --> 14:33.148
So... out with it.

14:33.286 --> 14:34.666
Why are you here?

14:34.804 --> 14:38.015
I told my team
that we couldn't trust you.

14:38.153 --> 14:39.395
But I'm gonna gamble
on the fact

14:39.533 --> 14:41.397
that your ambition
outweighs your loyalty.

14:41.535 --> 14:43.054
And I do have
a sneaking suspicion

14:43.192 --> 14:47.369
that you don't much like being
number two to Viktar Saroka.

14:47.507 --> 14:49.958
No comment.

14:50.096 --> 14:51.891
Let's walk.

14:54.514 --> 14:56.343
We know what's
inside the pouch.

14:56.481 --> 14:59.415
That was fast.
Does that mean you recovered it?

14:59.553 --> 15:01.038
No.
Someone got to it first.

15:01.176 --> 15:02.694
Killed the burglars,
took the pouch.

15:02.832 --> 15:05.835
But we do have photos
of what was inside.

15:07.527 --> 15:09.598
What, are you gonna
make me guess?

15:09.736 --> 15:12.670
Counterfeit plates
for an American $20 bill.

15:14.120 --> 15:16.605
And what is it you want
from me?

15:16.743 --> 15:18.745
Well, at a minimum, insight.

15:18.883 --> 15:22.749
At a maximum,
get us those plates back.

15:22.887 --> 15:24.958
Why would I do any of that
for you?

15:25.096 --> 15:27.167
No. No, no, no,
you wouldn't be doing it for me.

15:27.305 --> 15:28.858
You'd be doing it for you. Mm.

15:28.997 --> 15:30.930
Put your thumb on the scales
of justice, Rada,

15:31.068 --> 15:34.002
and you might just find yourself
becoming the new Consul General.

15:34.140 --> 15:36.314
Oh.

15:38.178 --> 15:41.561
Well, Viktar's too cautious
to do something so stupid.

15:41.699 --> 15:42.872
Focus on Kosta, his son.

15:43.011 --> 15:44.633
That boy is nothing
but trouble.

15:44.771 --> 15:47.394
And Viktar always cleans up
his baby boy's messes.

15:47.532 --> 15:50.225
Yeah, but, Rada, the kid's
got diplomatic immunity.

15:50.363 --> 15:52.089
And there's no guarantee
that I can push the state

15:52.227 --> 15:54.884
to revoke that immunity, so...

15:55.023 --> 15:56.403
Come on, how do we get
these plates back, please?

15:56.541 --> 15:57.922
- There's nothing I can do.
- No, no, no, Rada,

15:58.060 --> 15:59.889
wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

16:00.028 --> 16:03.031
There's a party tonight,
right, at the Consulate?

16:03.169 --> 16:04.584
The reception. Okay.

16:04.722 --> 16:06.379
Put two names
on the guest list for me.

16:06.517 --> 16:08.588
Viktar will smell
undercover agents a mile away.

16:08.726 --> 16:11.004
I think I have a way
around that.

16:12.385 --> 16:14.387
Our prime suspect
is Kosta Saroka.

16:14.525 --> 16:16.665
He's the 23-year-old son
of the Consul General,

16:16.803 --> 16:17.977
and he's been in the U.S.
with his father

16:18.115 --> 16:19.219
for the last three years.

16:19.357 --> 16:21.221
He's taken complete advantage

16:21.359 --> 16:22.498
of his diplomatic immunity.

16:22.636 --> 16:24.052
He was arrested five times--

16:24.190 --> 16:26.502
assault, drugs, theft.

16:26.640 --> 16:28.573
Yeah, but he's walked away
every time.

16:28.711 --> 16:30.403
This kid has got
to feel invincible.

16:30.541 --> 16:32.163
For our purposes,
he basically is.

16:32.301 --> 16:33.406
The only way
we can arrest him

16:33.544 --> 16:35.477
is if Belarus revokes
his immunity,

16:35.615 --> 16:36.754
which is a big lift.

16:36.892 --> 16:38.342
And that's why
our first priority

16:38.480 --> 16:39.860
is to recover
these currency plates.

16:39.999 --> 16:42.173
Now, Senator Smith
has pulled some strings

16:42.311 --> 16:43.692
at the State Department
and got us approved

16:43.830 --> 16:45.418
to conduct
a black bag operation.

16:45.556 --> 16:47.592
Inside
the Belarus Consulate?

16:47.730 --> 16:49.629
- Brendon and Laura are going in.
- No, I can't--
I can't do that.

16:49.767 --> 16:51.769
I'm too famous in Belarus
to go undercover.

16:51.907 --> 16:54.737
Exactly. Which is why you will
be going in as yourself.

16:54.875 --> 16:56.670
Ooh.
Yeah, that's right.

16:56.808 --> 16:59.846
A paid public appearance
at tonight's Consulate reception

16:59.984 --> 17:02.193
by none other than
the Vampire Cop himself

17:02.331 --> 17:05.127
organized by his publicist,
Bibby Baxter.

17:06.853 --> 17:10.063
That sounds like an alias
for a Marvel superhero.

17:10.201 --> 17:12.652
Next time you got to let me come
up with the undercover names,

17:12.790 --> 17:16.518
because you do not d--
do it well, sir.

17:18.106 --> 17:19.866
While Brendon steals
all the focus,

17:20.004 --> 17:21.109
Laura, you are gonna
find your way

17:21.247 --> 17:22.627
into the Consul General's
office,

17:22.765 --> 17:24.319
where most likely
these plates are locked

17:24.457 --> 17:26.114
in a safe behind his desk.

17:26.252 --> 17:27.736
Oh, ha, that's great.

17:27.874 --> 17:30.911
But my safe-cracking skills
leave a little to be desired.

17:31.050 --> 17:32.879
Then it's a good thing
I already have the entry code.

17:33.017 --> 17:35.088
That is next-level smooth, boss.

17:35.226 --> 17:37.504
Smooth or not, this is not
a normal undercover op.

17:37.642 --> 17:39.368
Brendon and Laura will be
on sovereign territory.

17:39.506 --> 17:40.852
If they get in trouble,
we won't be able to

17:40.990 --> 17:42.406
just bust in
and save them.

17:42.544 --> 17:43.717
Speak for yourself.

17:43.855 --> 17:45.926
If anything happens
to my boy,

17:46.065 --> 17:48.998
you already know
I'm going full mama bear.

17:49.137 --> 17:50.241
Huh.

17:50.379 --> 17:52.071
Yeah, you got it worse.

17:52.209 --> 17:53.727
What's that supposed
- to mean?
- Never mind.

17:53.865 --> 17:55.350
Laura, Brendon,
go get your glam on.

17:55.488 --> 17:57.041
Carter, fire up
the surveillance van.

17:57.179 --> 17:58.974
This party starts
in an hour.

18:05.636 --> 18:08.052
- Simone, a word?
- Yeah, what's up?

18:08.190 --> 18:10.675
I heard that Brendon was going
undercover at a party.

18:10.813 --> 18:12.677
Oh, girl,
don't worry about that.

18:12.815 --> 18:14.334
I'm gonna be in a van
right outside.

18:14.472 --> 18:16.543
It's not his safety
I'm worried about.

18:16.681 --> 18:19.408
- It's his sobriety.
- What?

18:19.546 --> 18:21.928
Did you know his sponsor
fell on a wagon?

18:22.066 --> 18:24.413
<i>Off</i> the wagon.
And no, he didn't tell me.

18:24.551 --> 18:26.208
You're closest to him.

18:26.346 --> 18:28.245
Say no more.
I'm on it.

18:28.383 --> 18:30.039
Good looking out.

18:30.178 --> 18:31.938
Thank you.

18:32.076 --> 18:33.560
Damn, B.

18:33.698 --> 18:36.080
You going to catch
a crook or a date?

18:36.218 --> 18:37.737
'Cause you fine.

18:37.875 --> 18:39.842
You see it.
Yes, I do.

18:39.980 --> 18:41.085
Hmm.

18:41.223 --> 18:43.812
- You sure you're up for it?
- Yeah.

18:43.950 --> 18:44.985
Laura's got to do
all the hard work.

18:45.124 --> 18:48.472
I just got to show up,
be me--

18:48.610 --> 18:49.783
Well, old me.

18:49.921 --> 18:53.925
Well, the old you used to drink
at parties like this.

18:54.063 --> 18:55.479
It could get uncomfortable.

18:55.617 --> 18:58.067
Yeah, I've been to plenty
of bars sober, you know?

18:58.206 --> 19:00.069
Remember back
at Quantico?

19:00.208 --> 19:01.795
Used to go drinking
with the NATs?

19:01.933 --> 19:03.314
Oh, yeah.

19:03.452 --> 19:06.317
And you would hold on
to one drink all night

19:06.455 --> 19:10.287
until I would always
"accidentally" spill it on you

19:10.425 --> 19:12.461
so you didn't
- have to take a sip.
- Mm-hmm.

19:12.599 --> 19:14.567
The difference is,
I won't be there.

19:16.914 --> 19:19.054
Antoinette
told you about Randy?

19:19.192 --> 19:21.332
Mm. Why didn't you?

19:21.470 --> 19:23.092
You got enough on your plate.
It's-- It's fine.

19:23.231 --> 19:24.577
- Don't do that.
- Do what?

19:24.715 --> 19:27.752
I always have time
for you.

19:27.890 --> 19:30.583
I know.
I just, you know...

19:30.721 --> 19:32.619
Randy's my guy.

19:32.757 --> 19:34.103
He saved my life.

19:34.242 --> 19:36.036
He told me what to do,
when to do it.

19:36.175 --> 19:38.970
A-And, uh,
had 10 years sober.

19:39.108 --> 19:41.110
You know, if he can go out,
what chance do I have?

19:41.249 --> 19:43.423
Hey,
you got to tell Garza

19:43.561 --> 19:45.184
and be pulled from
the assignment.

19:45.322 --> 19:47.910
I mean, nothing is more
important than your sobriety.

19:48.048 --> 19:49.947
Nothing.
We're rookies.

19:50.085 --> 19:51.466
We've got to prove ourselves
every day.

19:51.604 --> 19:53.192

of my job I can't do.

19:53.330 --> 19:56.160

I always do.

19:58.024 --> 19:59.474

19:59.612 --> 20:02.684

on your shoulder.

20:05.825 --> 20:06.860
That'll be a first.

Don't worry about me.

23:48.530 --> 23:49.945

Mm.

23:57.194 --> 23:59.576
Here.
I gotcha.

23:59.714 --> 24:01.509
They ambushed me,
knocked me out

24:01.647 --> 24:03.511
before I could see
a face.

24:03.649 --> 24:04.857

24:15.212 --> 24:16.903

24:20.493 --> 24:21.805

- Watch me.
- Simone, stand down.

24:24.497 --> 24:26.050
But--
Laura,

24:26.188 --> 24:28.190
tell the Consul General
to answer his phone.

24:28.328 --> 24:29.744
Sir,
your phone is gonna ring.

24:29.882 --> 24:31.262
- You should answer it.
- What?

24:31.400 --> 24:33.886
Your phone, sir.

24:35.853 --> 24:37.786
Hello?
Who is this?

24:37.924 --> 24:39.512
Matthew Garza, FBI.

24:41.514 --> 24:43.412
And these two
belong to you.

24:43.551 --> 24:45.898
<i>Yes, and I want
them back right now.</i> Sure.

24:46.036 --> 24:48.901
After I hold a press conference
about your FBI

24:49.039 --> 24:53.112
committing an illegal break-in
into <i>my</i> Consulate.

24:53.250 --> 24:54.907
Fine, and then I'll hold
my own press conference

24:55.045 --> 24:58.151
detailing a Belarus conspiracy
to devalue the U.S. dollar

24:58.289 --> 24:59.912
by using counterfeits.

25:00.050 --> 25:02.466
You tell me,
Consul General,

25:02.604 --> 25:04.951
<i>who wins that press war?</i>

25:05.089 --> 25:08.092
They're gonna walk out
the front door, Viktar.

25:12.269 --> 25:13.995
<i>Escort them out.</i>

25:21.105 --> 25:23.763
It's a lovely dress.

25:23.901 --> 25:25.178
Which I would like
for you to burn

25:25.316 --> 25:26.870
when you're done
collecting all the DNA

25:27.008 --> 25:28.630
from my attacker
off of it.

25:28.768 --> 25:30.287
No use in keeping
a failure dress.

25:30.425 --> 25:33.048
Hey, we know more now
than we did before, right?

25:33.186 --> 25:34.705
Kosta took
those currency plates.

25:34.843 --> 25:36.569
He left the Consulate.

25:36.707 --> 25:38.226
He was there to steal it,
just like us, so...

25:38.364 --> 25:40.055
So father and son
aren't working together on this.

25:40.193 --> 25:42.161
Maybe Viktar found out
what his son was up to.

25:42.299 --> 25:43.887
Tried to stop him.

25:44.025 --> 25:45.785
We just need to figure out
where Kosta's going to next.

25:45.923 --> 25:47.442
Yeah, well,
I have a BOLO out for him,

25:47.580 --> 25:48.788
so let's see
if we get lucky.

25:48.926 --> 25:50.272
Okay.
Finished.

25:50.410 --> 25:51.584
Can you please rush that?

25:51.722 --> 25:53.137
We need hard evidence
to build this case.

25:53.275 --> 25:54.553
Thank you.

25:54.691 --> 25:56.175
Thanks.

25:59.178 --> 26:03.044
Hey, uh, why'd you tell Simone
about my sponsor?

26:04.597 --> 26:07.220
I was worried about you.

26:07.358 --> 26:10.189
The way
you've been acting...

26:10.327 --> 26:11.984
Are you okay?

26:12.122 --> 26:14.331
I-I wanted to tell her.

26:14.469 --> 26:15.988
And I'm fine.
No, you're not.

26:16.126 --> 26:17.817

26:20.475 --> 26:21.718

26:21.856 --> 26:23.685

than I do.

26:23.823 --> 26:25.204
I...

26:27.378 --> 26:28.828
N-Nothing makes sense
right now.

26:28.966 --> 26:31.003
But isn't that
the AA mantra?

26:31.141 --> 26:32.936
"One day at a time."

26:33.074 --> 26:34.903
Except I've done everything
you're not supposed to do

26:35.041 --> 26:37.043
in the first year
of recovery.

26:37.181 --> 26:40.219

too much.

26:51.264 --> 26:53.612

hinting at?

26:56.028 --> 26:57.443

27:01.758 --> 27:03.449
I-I really need
to be there.

27:03.587 --> 27:05.071

27:05.209 --> 27:07.073

27:14.011 --> 27:15.910

It's more than your body.
You need to rest your mind.

29:09.023 --> 29:10.645
Extra sleep isn't enough.

29:10.783 --> 29:11.922
Simone, at this rate,

29:12.060 --> 29:14.062
you're gonna burn yourself out
in six months.

29:14.200 --> 29:16.237

Oh, good morning,

29:18.687 --> 29:19.654
Good morning.

29:19.792 --> 29:21.207
Now,
who do we have here?

29:21.345 --> 29:22.726
Daddy,
this is my friend Naomi.

29:22.864 --> 29:25.867
Oh, your friend
or your <i>friend</i> friend?

29:26.005 --> 29:27.524
Oh, my God.

29:27.662 --> 29:30.113
Why do you have
to make everything so weird?

29:30.251 --> 29:33.185
No, Daddy,
she is just my friend.

29:33.323 --> 29:35.739
Naomi,
this is my dad, Cutty.

29:35.877 --> 29:38.569
- Nice to meet you.
- Pleasure.

29:38.707 --> 29:41.296
Well, sorry I can't stay around
and charm you ladies,

29:41.434 --> 29:43.954
but I got my weekly
chess match,

29:44.092 --> 29:48.096
and today,
I is bringing the pain.

29:48.234 --> 29:50.236
- Good luck.
- I don't need it.

29:50.374 --> 29:52.238
I gotta go, too.
You want a ride?

29:52.376 --> 29:54.275
Nah.
Brendon is gonna swoop me.

29:54.413 --> 29:56.622

Antoinette got
a DNA hit from my dress.

30:06.632 --> 30:08.530
The guy who attacked me
at the embassy was Kosta,

30:08.668 --> 30:09.738
just like we thought.

30:09.877 --> 30:11.326
Finally,
some hard evidence.

30:11.464 --> 30:13.432
But he's still out there
with those counterfeit plates.

30:13.570 --> 30:15.848
Yeah, well, he's either
gonna try to sell them
to a third party,

30:15.986 --> 30:17.781
or he's gonna try to make
himself some funny money, right?

30:17.919 --> 30:20.819

is a rock star.

30:20.957 --> 30:22.441
Yeah, and expensive.

Just keep

family oligarch rich,

30:31.312 --> 30:33.348

How you doing, B?

30:35.972 --> 30:38.319
Great.
How are you?

30:39.734 --> 30:41.287
I would say "great,"
too,

30:41.425 --> 30:43.842
but then I'd be lying
just as hard as you are.

30:43.980 --> 30:45.636
You want coffee?

30:45.774 --> 30:47.673
No, no, I'm good.
We got to roll, actually.

30:47.811 --> 30:49.640
Boss just texted.
So, Kosta's still in the wind.

30:49.778 --> 30:51.435
He wants us to liaise
with the Secret Service,

30:51.573 --> 30:54.438
see if there's any Russian
or Belarusian printers

30:54.576 --> 30:56.130
who are suspected counterfeiters.

30:56.268 --> 30:58.718
We can skip the, uh,
Secret Service part of it.

30:58.857 --> 31:02.550
- Why is that?
- Because my dad plays chess
with some Russian guys.

31:02.688 --> 31:04.690
One of them, Anton,
is a former Redfella.

31:04.828 --> 31:06.554
You know, Russian mafia.

31:06.692 --> 31:09.143
- Uh-huh.
- And, baby, he likes to talk.

31:12.663 --> 31:13.768
Clever.

31:13.906 --> 31:16.667
Do not patronize me, Anton.

31:18.083 --> 31:19.394
Ahh.

31:19.532 --> 31:23.053
Daddy, breaking the clock
is not gonna make it any better.

31:23.191 --> 31:26.885
Simone,
what are you doing here?

31:27.023 --> 31:29.232
Can't a girl come watch
her daddy in action?

31:29.370 --> 31:33.063
She can.
But you would not.

31:33.201 --> 31:36.860
And you know better than
to distract the player mid-game.

31:36.998 --> 31:38.586
Well, I didn't come
to distract you.

31:38.724 --> 31:41.002
I came to distract
your opponent.

31:41.140 --> 31:43.211
Hey, Anton.
This is Brendon.

31:43.349 --> 31:46.214
- He's an FBI special agent, too.
- Hey.

31:46.352 --> 31:48.078
Can we chat?

31:48.216 --> 31:49.390
About what?

31:49.528 --> 31:50.770
The circles
you used to run in.

31:50.909 --> 31:53.601
Hey, hey, now, hold on.
Anton is my friend.

31:53.739 --> 31:55.879
You're not about
to interrogate--It's all right, Cutty.
It's all right.

31:56.017 --> 31:58.502
Let-- Let her go,
let her ask her questions.

32:00.366 --> 32:01.885
We just wanted to talk to you
about some Eastern Bloc folks

32:02.023 --> 32:04.405
who know a thing or two
about counterfeiting.

32:04.543 --> 32:07.373
Yeah, somebody is making
fake $20 bills.

32:07.511 --> 32:09.720
You think you can help us
figure out who it is?

32:09.858 --> 32:13.759
I'll entertain you,
you entertain me, huh?

32:13.897 --> 32:16.658
I beat your father
every week.
Not true.

32:16.796 --> 32:18.350
It's true.

32:18.488 --> 32:21.284
If you can take his place
and, uh, beat me,

32:21.422 --> 32:23.286
then sure, maybe I can
call some colleagues

32:23.424 --> 32:25.357
and, uh, we'll see
what we can find out.

32:25.495 --> 32:28.153
Game on.
Slide over, Daddy.

32:30.017 --> 32:32.951
Teach this young man
a few things.

32:33.089 --> 32:36.230
You made a big mistake.

32:36.368 --> 32:38.335
Should have asked
for a fresh game.

32:39.405 --> 32:41.752
I'm about to beat your father
in three moves.

32:41.890 --> 32:45.549
Maybe that's true for my dad,
but not for me, comrade.

32:45.687 --> 32:48.414
- Let's get it.
- Arrogance. I like that.

32:48.552 --> 32:50.209
But do you like this?

32:55.870 --> 32:57.561
Brendon, I was just
thinking about it.

32:57.699 --> 32:59.701
You paid for lunch
last week, remember?

32:59.839 --> 33:01.945
Can I pay you back...

33:02.083 --> 33:03.774
with a check?

33:06.294 --> 33:07.744
Oh, snap.

33:07.882 --> 33:10.436
B, I don't know if we locked
the car when we got out.

33:10.574 --> 33:12.783
You should go... check.

33:22.552 --> 33:25.003
That's what you call
a panic move.

33:25.141 --> 33:28.834
Now, I'm just gonna sit back
and let the clock run out

33:28.972 --> 33:33.114
so you can realize
how screwed you are.

33:33.252 --> 33:36.014
I resign.

33:36.152 --> 33:38.533
You have a very
special daughter there.

33:38.671 --> 33:41.847
Yeah, I was gonna say annoying, but...

33:41.985 --> 33:44.884
I will say special.

33:45.023 --> 33:47.508
Gonna make
those phone calls now, Anton?

33:51.960 --> 33:53.859
This feels like
a wild goose chase.

33:53.997 --> 33:55.654
Have faith, Carter.

33:59.347 --> 34:01.177
Mr. Vorovin,
it's the FBI.

34:01.315 --> 34:04.283
It's the FBI, sir.
We just want to talk.

34:06.561 --> 34:07.700
Get down!

34:12.360 --> 34:14.017
He's reloading.

34:14.155 --> 34:15.708
FBI! Drop it.

34:15.846 --> 34:17.124
We got the plates, Carter.

34:17.262 --> 34:19.574
Cuff him!

34:19.712 --> 34:20.920
A ton of funny money.

34:21.059 --> 34:23.026
We got you on
counterfeiting and murder.

34:23.164 --> 34:24.648
You won't be able
to charge me.

34:24.786 --> 34:26.305
I have diplomatic immunity.

34:26.443 --> 34:27.893
Maybe we can't charge you,

34:28.031 --> 34:30.792
but we can hold you for
as long as the law will allow.

34:32.173 --> 34:34.762
What about you,
sweet thing?

34:34.900 --> 34:36.695
You don't have
diplomatic immunity.

34:36.833 --> 34:38.214
You want to talk?

34:38.352 --> 34:39.836
Don't tell them anything.

34:39.974 --> 34:41.320
Take this guy outside

34:41.458 --> 34:43.840
while we have a little chat
with his friend.

34:45.462 --> 34:46.532
I'm not talking.

34:46.670 --> 34:48.362
You just did.

34:48.500 --> 34:51.330
- I'm supposed to play dumb.
- You're way too smart
for that.

34:51.468 --> 34:52.573
Would you like
to make a deal?

34:52.711 --> 34:54.402
What does this mean?
A deal?

34:54.540 --> 34:57.578
You tell us the truth, and we
take years off your sentence.

34:57.716 --> 34:59.269
Like how they do
on American TV?

34:59.407 --> 35:01.996
Like "Vampire Cop"?

35:03.687 --> 35:05.413
"Crime sucks."

35:05.551 --> 35:08.554
Yes, "Crime sucks."
I love that show.

35:08.692 --> 35:10.591
In my family, we'd watch
it together in Belarus.

35:10.729 --> 35:13.697
Well, maybe we could
make an introduction

35:13.835 --> 35:15.285
if you tell us
what we need to know.

35:15.423 --> 35:18.530
I mean, the guy who plays
Vampire Cop, he works with us.

35:18.668 --> 35:20.394
My family would be amazed.

35:20.532 --> 35:21.912
Cooperate and you'll
make it back home

35:22.050 --> 35:23.259
to see them again
real soon.

35:23.397 --> 35:25.088
Where is Kosta?

35:26.572 --> 35:28.264
- On the hunt.
- For what?

35:28.402 --> 35:29.851
A woman from the Consulate.

35:29.989 --> 35:31.612
Rada Rybak?
Yes.

35:31.750 --> 35:33.407
Kosta says she is threat
and must be killed

35:33.545 --> 35:35.512
so Minsk can't replace
his father with her.

37:01.840 --> 37:03.842
- Nice seeing you again.
- It hurts.

37:03.980 --> 37:06.672
- I need doctor.
- Cowboy up, Kosta.

37:06.810 --> 37:08.018
Ambulance is on its way.

37:10.158 --> 37:12.160
You okay?

37:20.238 --> 37:22.101
You doing your Wednesday
FaceTime dinner with Atlas?

37:22.240 --> 37:24.725
Mm. He's gonna get
an earful tonight.

37:24.863 --> 37:27.003
You still struggling
with what happened?

37:27.141 --> 37:28.867
No.

37:29.005 --> 37:30.662
A little.

37:30.800 --> 37:33.216
I don't know which part's worse,
trying not to be terrified

37:33.354 --> 37:34.769
so you can do your job

37:34.907 --> 37:38.083
or being terrified and
still having to do your job.

37:38.221 --> 37:39.981
Mm.
I mean, they both suck.

37:42.812 --> 37:44.227
You know,
I've been thinking,

37:44.365 --> 37:47.541
and I've come to the fair
conclusion that I was wrong.

37:47.679 --> 37:49.439
Brendon is way more work
as a rookie than Simone.

37:49.577 --> 37:51.130
- So, you win.
- Okay.

37:51.269 --> 37:54.202
What are you talking about?
A-A pity victory?

37:54.341 --> 37:55.583

37:55.721 --> 37:58.103
How fragile do you think I am?
No way.

I know what I've gotten
into with you,

40:19.865 --> 40:23.421
and... I'm willing
to put in the work.

40:26.389 --> 40:28.115
Are you?

40:28.253 --> 40:30.842
♪ That I'm falling apart,
I'm over this ♪

40:48.584 --> 40:51.552
♪ I'm down, I'm fearing
my own loneliness ♪

40:51.690 --> 40:53.554
LAPD. Open up.

40:56.454 --> 40:57.627
You know you're wrong
for that.

40:57.765 --> 40:59.905
You're right.
My bad.

41:00.043 --> 41:01.424
Let me make it up to you
with a little gift.

41:01.562 --> 41:02.943
What is it?

41:03.081 --> 41:06.084
Something for you to concentrate
on besides work.

41:06.222 --> 41:09.087
Something that will relax
your body and your mind.

41:09.225 --> 41:11.089

my broken mess ♪

41:11.227 --> 41:12.608
Knitting?

41:12.746 --> 41:15.231
I know you trippin'.
I'm not.

41:15.369 --> 41:17.233
For real, I tripped
when my cousin in Oakland

41:17.371 --> 41:18.786
turned me on to knitting.

41:18.924 --> 41:21.444
At first,
I was real sus.

41:21.582 --> 41:23.998
Then I made a beanie cap,
and I was like,

41:24.136 --> 41:26.725
"Damn, twisting knots
is very therapeutic."

41:26.863 --> 41:28.347
Who knew?

41:29.728 --> 41:33.283
Well, where do we start?

41:33.421 --> 41:36.114
With your hands.

41:36.252 --> 41:38.979
First we start with a slipknot,
and then we'll cast on.

41:39.117 --> 41:41.395
♪ And I fear this
will come to an end ♪

41:41.533 --> 41:43.604
You all right?

41:43.742 --> 41:46.124
So, you really think

41:46.262 --> 41:49.886
<i>this</i> is gonna keep me
from burning out?

41:50.024 --> 41:52.268
I don't know.

41:52.406 --> 41:56.030
But if it doesn't,
we'll find something that will.

41:56.168 --> 41:59.862
♪ I'm down, I'm fearing

42:00.000 --> 42:03.348
Okay. All right.
You said we need to cast on.

42:03.486 --> 42:04.660
Right.

42:04.798 --> 42:07.041
And then once
I teach you how to purl,

42:07.179 --> 42:08.284
you'll get into the zone.

42:08.422 --> 42:11.425
Into the zone?

42:11.563 --> 42:15.256
Girl, you got
a lot of layers.

42:15.394 --> 42:17.120
But I'm down.
Let's do it.

42:17.258 --> 42:23.437

42:23.575 --> 42:25.059
