WEBVTT

00:06.974 --> 00:07.808
happy you finally
brought her here to meet me.

00:10.511 --> 00:12.813
‐ You seem nice.
‐ The Clantons are in Purgatory.

00:12.846 --> 00:14.314
‐ An eye for an eye.

00:14.348 --> 00:16.049
‐ Doc, I think
they killed Billy.

00:16.083 --> 00:17.518
‐ I've been marked!

00:17.551 --> 00:19.520
‐ I'm tired of this fight.
‐ People can change.

00:19.553 --> 00:20.621
‐ Come to Mama.

00:21.855 --> 00:23.190
Hey, sexy.

00:23.223 --> 00:25.325
‐ My ancestors will devour her.

00:25.359 --> 00:26.827
(screaming)

00:26.860 --> 00:28.428
(gunshot)

00:28.996 --> 00:31.665
‐ I guess you and that gun
deserve each other.

00:31.698 --> 00:33.600
‐ Nicole Haught,
will you marry me?

00:33.634 --> 00:35.536
‐ Yes, I will marry you.

00:37.671 --> 00:40.173

00:44.411 --> 00:46.413

01:02.262 --> 01:04.264
I mean it, like, legit,
they're three feet from you

01:04.298 --> 01:06.533
and cost less than a dental dam.

01:06.567 --> 01:09.570
(Wynonna singing)

01:09.603 --> 01:12.573
(creature gobbling)

01:14.908 --> 01:16.610
‐ Time's up, beast.

01:17.711 --> 01:19.713
(suspenseful music)

01:21.615 --> 01:24.351
(both): Holy shit.

01:26.019 --> 01:28.655
‐ I see you found your gun.

01:29.890 --> 01:33.327

01:58.151 --> 02:00.287
(laughing)
Again!

02:00.320 --> 02:02.623
‐ Hey! It took me weeks
to find that couch.

02:02.656 --> 02:04.725
‐ To Nicole and Waverly.

02:04.758 --> 02:07.194
May you grow old
on one pillow.

02:07.761 --> 02:08.829
Cheers.

02:08.862 --> 02:10.263
‐ Don't squander
the eloquence now.

02:10.297 --> 02:12.566
Real engagement party's
tomorrow.

02:13.233 --> 02:15.702
‐ Alas, I must send my regrets.

02:15.736 --> 02:16.770
‐ What?
‐ You're not coming?

02:16.803 --> 02:19.306
‐ But here is another toast.

02:19.339 --> 02:21.775
To all the kisses
we have snatched,

02:21.808 --> 02:23.543
and vice versa.

02:24.177 --> 02:25.479
‐ Oh, my God.
(Doc clearing throat)

02:25.512 --> 02:27.080
‐ Beg pardon.
Sometimes in a bar,

02:27.114 --> 02:28.148
a gentleman forgets himself.

02:28.181 --> 02:30.250
‐ I'd like to forget that.
‐ Hmm.

02:30.283 --> 02:32.152
You know what helps?
Mindless labour.

02:32.185 --> 02:33.754
Why don't we get more ice?

02:35.088 --> 02:38.425
‐ It's been over a month,
you have to come.

02:38.458 --> 02:41.361
This thing with Wynonna,
it's just another blip.

02:41.395 --> 02:43.463
‐ Yeah, well not to me,
it's not.

02:43.497 --> 02:45.966
‐ Really making a go
of this, huh?

02:45.999 --> 02:48.268
‐ Uh, well I don't have
much choice.

02:48.301 --> 02:50.837
Turns out Chrissy invested
my entire pension

02:50.871 --> 02:51.838
into this old gal.

02:51.872 --> 02:53.607
‐ Okay, but you have to get
some real staff

02:53.640 --> 02:55.842
to help you out, alright?
‐ Hey, where's Wynonna?

02:55.876 --> 02:56.977
I really need you two

02:57.010 --> 02:58.812
to take care of this
basement business.

02:58.845 --> 03:00.213
Imagine that people found out

03:00.247 --> 03:02.849
I've got a teenage
killer Reaper down there?

03:02.883 --> 03:05.752
They're mad enough I took
potato skins off the menu.

03:06.253 --> 03:08.155
‐ Did you tell that little
glow stick of yours

03:08.188 --> 03:10.257
that you wouldn't have found it
if I hadn't helped?

03:12.059 --> 03:13.827
‐ It says that, uh...

03:13.860 --> 03:17.230
a monster who knows all the goss
is still a monster.

03:17.264 --> 03:19.232
‐ Well, this monster
isn't hurting anyone.

03:19.266 --> 03:20.967
‐ I'll bet you Bambi's
got a different take.

03:21.001 --> 03:23.236
‐ Bambi's food.

03:24.571 --> 03:26.973
And unless you faint
at the sight of sausages

03:27.007 --> 03:30.143
or that jacket of yours is made
of rare zucchini leather,

03:30.177 --> 03:32.479
you can't judge me.
‐ Except, I've never donned a...

03:32.512 --> 03:35.615
What is that? A lobster bib
for leather queens?

03:36.616 --> 03:38.385
‐ If I don't wear it,

03:38.418 --> 03:41.088
my dry‐cleaning bills
are a bitch.

03:42.956 --> 03:44.791
(unsettling music)

03:45.959 --> 03:48.862
‐ It's just good to remember...

03:48.895 --> 03:51.465
that I can kill you.

03:53.066 --> 03:55.168
Any time I want.

03:55.202 --> 03:57.037
(Amon chuckles)

03:57.070 --> 03:59.272
‐ Who told you my kink?

04:00.774 --> 04:02.809
(eerie music)

04:04.911 --> 04:07.214
(chuckling)

04:08.715 --> 04:10.383
(birds chirping)

04:13.954 --> 04:16.123
‐ Mmm...

04:18.125 --> 04:20.560
We back, honey.

04:20.594 --> 04:22.829
‐ Back in Valdosta,
my uncle Thomas,

04:22.863 --> 04:24.464
he taught me to woodwork.

04:24.498 --> 04:27.033
Should you wish to be married
beneath an arbour,

04:27.067 --> 04:29.369
it would be my honour
to build you one.

04:29.402 --> 04:31.271
As a gift.
‐ Doc!

04:31.304 --> 04:33.740
(door opening)
You're going to make me cry.

04:33.774 --> 04:37.444
‐ Well, slap my ass
and call me the sister‐in‐law!

04:38.445 --> 04:40.647
Except you. You're not allowed
to participate

04:40.680 --> 04:41.948
in the slapping of ass.

04:42.415 --> 04:45.485
‐ Congratulations... again.

04:52.025 --> 04:53.360
‐ You didn't warn me
you were partying

04:53.393 --> 04:54.327
with The Lame Ranger.

04:54.361 --> 04:56.897
‐ Where have you been?
We called hours ago.

04:57.130 --> 04:58.665
‐ Been a little busy.

04:58.698 --> 05:01.968
‐ Oh yeah? Too busy to celebrate
your sister's engagement?

05:02.002 --> 05:03.570
‐ No!

05:04.070 --> 05:06.106
I was busy...

05:06.139 --> 05:08.475
making plans to celebrate.

05:08.508 --> 05:12.112
Intricate, planny... plans.

05:12.145 --> 05:13.847
‐ Really?
‐ Yeah.

05:13.880 --> 05:15.348
‐ Oh yeah? What kind?

05:17.717 --> 05:19.786
‐ The bachelorette.

05:19.820 --> 05:21.555
Girls' night out!

05:22.155 --> 05:25.058
(heavy club music)

05:25.091 --> 05:27.260
(women cheering)

05:32.165 --> 05:35.035
‐ This isn't a girls' night out,

05:35.068 --> 05:37.137
this is ladies' night.

05:37.170 --> 05:38.972
‐ I didn't know
it would be male strippers.

05:39.005 --> 05:40.340
‐ Oh yeah? Didn't come up

05:40.373 --> 05:42.542
when you were making
your planny‐plans?

05:44.711 --> 05:46.680
‐ Hey! Giuseppe!

05:46.713 --> 05:49.015
This bride needs a delivery!
‐ No. Stop.

05:49.049 --> 05:50.984
Stop!
‐ Come bring the soppressata!

05:51.017 --> 05:52.652
(women cheering)

05:52.686 --> 05:54.154
‐ Another bride!

05:54.187 --> 05:56.389
‐ Uh, no, I'm not a bride.

05:56.990 --> 05:58.725
‐ But I am her fiancée!

05:58.758 --> 06:00.160
‐ Cute!

06:00.193 --> 06:02.829
Love the lob, girl.

06:03.363 --> 06:04.798
Shots?
‐ Oh...

06:04.831 --> 06:07.467
‐ My bridal party bailed
to go to Bible study.

06:07.500 --> 06:10.303
(chuckling)
‐ Well, it is noon on a Sunday.

06:10.337 --> 06:12.873
(women cheering)

06:13.206 --> 06:14.908
‐ Okay. Oh!

06:18.111 --> 06:19.646
(Waverly sighs)

06:19.679 --> 06:20.814
‐ Yep!

06:20.847 --> 06:24.084
Definitely time to get
that hot ginger off the market.

06:24.784 --> 06:27.187
‐ As if you have anything
to worry about.

06:27.220 --> 06:29.022
Everybody loves Waverly Earp.

06:29.055 --> 06:30.790
Nobody's gonna steal
your sunshine.

06:32.092 --> 06:35.462
‐ Yeah, well, Nicole wants
to do it ASAP anyway.

06:35.495 --> 06:37.631
Maybe just at City Hall.

06:37.664 --> 06:41.801
‐ But how will the sparrows
weave your gown that quickly?

06:42.335 --> 06:43.904
‐ It's her second.

06:43.937 --> 06:46.940
She wasn't even a fancy
wedding person the first time.

06:48.241 --> 06:50.944
‐ Yeah, but you've had
bridal scrapbooks

06:50.977 --> 06:52.412
since you were ten.

06:52.445 --> 06:54.981
Just tell her
what you want, baby girl.

06:55.949 --> 06:57.350
You deserve it.

06:57.384 --> 06:59.552
(man over speaker): Tie down
those saddlebags,

06:59.586 --> 07:02.155
the West is getting wild!

07:02.188 --> 07:05.125
Welcome... Demetri!

07:05.158 --> 07:06.826
(country music, women cheering)

07:10.597 --> 07:13.400
‐ Oh baby, you should
smile more! You'd be prettier!

07:13.433 --> 07:16.202
‐ Reverse sexism
is still sexism, Wynonna.

07:16.236 --> 07:17.771
‐ Fine.

07:17.804 --> 07:19.673
Show us your big...

07:19.706 --> 07:21.775
personality!

07:23.944 --> 07:25.779
(magical sparkling)

07:25.812 --> 07:27.714
‐ I know him.

07:27.747 --> 07:29.115
(bell dinging)

07:29.149 --> 07:30.817
‐ One bourbon, on the rocks.

07:32.452 --> 07:34.487
‐ You get juice.

07:37.223 --> 07:39.059
Kid your age
should be in school.

07:39.092 --> 07:40.193
(chuckling)
‐ Pass.

07:40.226 --> 07:41.761
I have nightmares about school.

07:41.795 --> 07:43.496
I end up naked in front
of an assembly,

07:43.530 --> 07:45.065
forgetting the words
to the national anthem.

07:45.098 --> 07:46.933
‐ Hmm.

07:47.300 --> 07:49.936
There'd be other kids your age
to hang out with.

07:50.770 --> 07:54.140
‐ Yeah, last time I tried that,
didn't turn out so well.

07:54.174 --> 07:55.709
‐ Billy Clanton.

07:55.742 --> 07:57.978
‐ I didn't know
he was a Clanton.

07:58.011 --> 08:00.680
‐ I don't blame people
for doing what they do

08:00.714 --> 08:02.282
when they don't know
what that is.

08:02.315 --> 08:04.017
‐ Like when you were
a barnacle beast

08:04.050 --> 08:05.752
and totally ate Nicole's cat?

08:06.920 --> 08:08.955
Sorry. I... I get weird

08:08.989 --> 08:11.591
when I spend too much time
at the homestead.

08:11.624 --> 08:12.892
Alone.

08:14.828 --> 08:16.296
‐ Well...

08:16.329 --> 08:18.164
I need a bar‐back.

08:18.898 --> 08:20.600
You clean up,
you follow my rules,

08:20.633 --> 08:23.436
you don't drink the booze,
you never go in the basement,

08:23.470 --> 08:25.305
and you never, ever...

08:25.338 --> 08:27.307
mention the cat again.

08:27.340 --> 08:29.642
‐ I swear on the bones
of Calamity Jane.

08:30.343 --> 08:31.711
That was the last time.

08:32.879 --> 08:34.047
‐ Okay.

08:34.914 --> 08:36.816
Well, Rachel...

08:38.251 --> 08:40.020
welcome to Team Shorty's.

08:40.053 --> 08:41.821
‐ Yay!
(laughing)

08:41.855 --> 08:43.890
(club music)

08:43.923 --> 08:45.458
(women cheering)

08:45.492 --> 08:47.494
‐ Butterball, Horn Dog,

08:47.527 --> 08:49.729
Blowjob!
‐ Oh!

08:49.763 --> 08:51.731
What is Friday night
at my ex's?

08:51.765 --> 08:53.800
‐ Ding! You win a shot!

08:54.334 --> 08:56.102
Aye.
‐ Aye, aye, aye.

08:56.136 --> 08:58.171
(background chatter)

08:58.204 --> 09:00.874
‐ You know, I would take it
over another night with my ex.

09:00.907 --> 09:02.208
Oh, yeah.

09:02.242 --> 09:03.910
Smug moustache...

09:04.878 --> 09:07.547
Lectures on my morality...
(laughing)

09:07.580 --> 09:12.085
Grabbing me like I'm a mustang
he's gonna break.

09:12.619 --> 09:15.655
Only that lightning‐fast
hands down my pants

09:15.688 --> 09:17.791
before I can even wish he...

09:17.824 --> 09:18.925
Ugh!

09:18.958 --> 09:20.627
‐ I'd tell you to move on
to women,

09:20.660 --> 09:22.062
but they're just as bad.

09:22.629 --> 09:24.497
Love is like the Tooth Fairy.

09:24.531 --> 09:26.299
‐ Never pays as well
as you think?

09:26.332 --> 09:28.068
‐ It don't exist!

09:29.402 --> 09:31.905
And I know! I've tried it all.

09:31.938 --> 09:33.106
I'm pan.

09:34.407 --> 09:35.942
‐ Pan I buy you another drink?

09:36.376 --> 09:38.044
‐ Uh...

09:39.879 --> 09:42.916
‐ Drinks, pink, purple, blue,
what you got?

09:42.949 --> 09:44.851
‐ No love is real.

09:45.685 --> 09:47.654
(Waverly scoffs)
I know that for a fact,

09:47.687 --> 09:50.857
because I am
a love professional.

09:53.059 --> 09:56.362
‐ Love might be the only thing
that's real.

09:56.396 --> 09:58.398
Nicole died for me.

09:58.431 --> 10:01.134
And I would kill for her.

10:01.167 --> 10:04.104
And if you can't feel that much,

10:04.137 --> 10:06.172
then I'm sorry for you.

10:06.206 --> 10:08.041
Truly.

10:11.578 --> 10:13.213
‐ You wanna bet on it?

10:13.246 --> 10:14.714
‐ What, that love is real?

10:14.747 --> 10:18.952
I don't know how we could
prove who won, but...

10:18.985 --> 10:20.286
sure.

10:20.320 --> 10:21.888
(chuckling)

10:22.489 --> 10:25.859
‐ Tell your sister
she is a delightful lunatic.

10:27.127 --> 10:30.997
And godspeed spreading
all that totally real love

10:31.030 --> 10:33.032
through the world.
(magical sparkling)

10:33.366 --> 10:35.201
‐ And good luck
with your strippering.

10:36.336 --> 10:38.571
(curious music)

10:39.405 --> 10:41.608
(magical sparkling)

10:49.449 --> 10:52.652
‐ Well, with Sheriff Holt
and his sister gone,

10:52.685 --> 10:54.387
there's no one here
to man the store.

10:55.054 --> 10:57.490
‐ Will there even be marriage
license applications?

10:57.524 --> 11:00.093
‐ Usually, they're here.

11:01.494 --> 11:03.663
‐ Mmm, baby.

11:03.696 --> 11:05.532
‐ Hi.
(giggling)

11:06.232 --> 11:09.335
‐ Hey, have you thought maybe...

11:09.369 --> 11:10.703
a suit?

11:10.737 --> 11:12.372
For the wedding?

11:13.740 --> 11:16.009
What did I do?
‐ No, no, nothing.

11:16.042 --> 11:18.278
You did nothing. It's just...

11:18.311 --> 11:19.946
the public stuff.

11:19.979 --> 11:22.215
I just feel like
what we have is...

11:22.248 --> 11:24.717
between us, you know, babe?
It's ours.

11:24.751 --> 11:27.353
‐ Nicole, there's nobody here.

11:28.321 --> 11:30.356
‐ Yeah, no.

11:30.390 --> 11:32.492
Just me and the Lord.

11:32.525 --> 11:34.327
And that curling trophy.

11:34.360 --> 11:35.862
‐ Bunny Loblaw?

11:35.895 --> 11:37.564
‐ Ms. Haught.

11:37.597 --> 11:40.500
Good to see you still know
where the police station is.

11:40.533 --> 11:42.268
‐ Well, I'm not your sheriff
anymore, Bunny.

11:42.302 --> 11:43.736
And we're here
on personal business.

11:43.770 --> 11:45.238
‐ Oh, let me guess.

11:45.271 --> 11:47.707
You want to institute
Flannel Fridays,

11:47.740 --> 11:49.676
and oh, maybe a few more

11:49.709 --> 11:51.578
off‐leash dog parks?

11:51.611 --> 11:53.613
‐ Well, I'm a cat person.

11:53.646 --> 11:56.616
‐ Oh, I remember
that homicidal puss.

11:57.183 --> 11:59.752
‐ Uh, is there someone else
we should be bothering

11:59.786 --> 12:02.522
with this request?
‐ Hmm... Uh‐uh!

12:03.156 --> 12:05.558
I am a one‐woman
volunteer city hall

12:05.592 --> 12:08.027
in a town of scofflaws.
(magical sparkling)

12:08.061 --> 12:11.431
(Waverly): Scofflaws?
(Bunny): Scofflaws! Layabouts!

12:11.464 --> 12:13.433
(whispering): Lesbians.

12:14.801 --> 12:17.136
(ethereal music)

12:26.546 --> 12:31.084
‐ My God, Waverly,
you are so beautiful.

12:31.117 --> 12:33.620
Have you always
been this beautiful before?

12:33.653 --> 12:36.723
‐ Uh... How long will it take
to get a license?

12:36.756 --> 12:38.691
‐ God, like, you're hot!

12:38.725 --> 12:42.729
You are like the wildest
combination of sweet and hot.

12:42.762 --> 12:44.030
‐ The Clayborns‐‐

12:44.063 --> 12:45.732
‐ Clantons.

12:45.765 --> 12:47.200
‐ Well, they've disappeared.

12:47.233 --> 12:48.368
And without a magistrate,

12:48.401 --> 12:50.236
I cannot guarantee
a quick turnaround.

12:50.270 --> 12:52.805
‐ Oh, you're like honey mustard.
I wanna spread you

12:52.839 --> 12:53.940
all over a pretzel.
‐ Sorry.

12:53.973 --> 12:55.808
‐ No, no, no!

12:55.842 --> 12:57.810
You do not do that in here!

12:57.844 --> 13:00.313
This is not
a soccer locker room!

13:00.346 --> 13:02.482
‐ Listen, you have to afford us
the same rights

13:02.515 --> 13:04.817
as any other couple.
Look, I do not want to fight,

13:04.851 --> 13:06.586
but I will if I have to.

13:06.619 --> 13:08.288
(quietly): Stop.

13:08.855 --> 13:12.125
‐ Fine. Oh, please.

13:14.794 --> 13:16.629
‐ Thank you, Ms. Loblaw.

13:22.068 --> 13:24.470
You have got to go home.
I don't know what that was,

13:24.504 --> 13:26.339
but I do not need it
on my next errand!

13:26.372 --> 13:28.441
‐ What do you mean,
I can't come with you?!

13:28.474 --> 13:30.543
‐ Take seven cold showers
and only think about

13:30.576 --> 13:32.445
Band of Brothers.
‐ Ugh!

13:33.046 --> 13:34.147
‐ Can I shut this for you?

13:34.180 --> 13:36.549
(magical sparkling)

13:36.582 --> 13:39.085
(ethereal music)

13:43.923 --> 13:46.092
‐ Anything you want.

13:47.260 --> 13:48.361
Oh...

13:51.030 --> 13:52.365
‐ It's apple.

13:52.398 --> 13:54.534
‐ Okay?

13:54.901 --> 13:58.871
‐ In China, the word
for apple is "ping",

13:58.905 --> 14:02.475
which is also
a homonym for peace.

14:02.508 --> 14:03.810
‐ Peace?

14:03.843 --> 14:06.045
Your sister
is killing my business

14:06.079 --> 14:08.181
by killing my customers.

14:08.214 --> 14:11.150
‐ And I will
mention that to her.

14:11.918 --> 14:13.619
Anyway...

14:13.653 --> 14:17.090
I went to pick up a marriage
application today.

14:19.492 --> 14:22.829
‐ Was little Cleo Clanton
in the office?

14:23.363 --> 14:25.031
‐ The magistrate?
‐ Mm‐hmm.

14:25.064 --> 14:26.165
‐ Nope.

14:26.199 --> 14:29.435
‐ Something big happened
over on their ranch awhile back.

14:29.469 --> 14:32.105
Margo Clanton is one bitch
of a witch.

14:32.138 --> 14:36.242
Only something spectacular
could've taken her out.

14:38.945 --> 14:40.680
Why don't you cut to the chase?

14:41.948 --> 14:44.250
‐ I want to choose a date,

14:44.283 --> 14:47.587
but my fiancée is nervous
because of...

14:47.620 --> 14:49.789
well, all the...

14:49.822 --> 14:51.924
yous... around.

14:52.658 --> 14:55.895
If I could tell her
there was a day

14:55.928 --> 14:59.065
that we'd been promised a truce,

14:59.098 --> 15:01.033
that would help a ton.

15:01.067 --> 15:04.137
Just one day of...

15:04.570 --> 15:06.239
ping!

15:07.473 --> 15:09.542
That was weird.

15:09.575 --> 15:10.910
(sighing)

15:10.943 --> 15:12.512
(magical sparkling)

15:13.946 --> 15:17.049
(ethereal music)

15:23.689 --> 15:24.757
‐ Waverly Earp...

15:24.791 --> 15:29.429
I will fight for you
to have peace for all your days.

15:29.996 --> 15:32.799
‐ Just the one
will be peachy.

15:32.832 --> 15:34.567
Thanks.

15:34.600 --> 15:35.768
‐ Ah...

15:37.270 --> 15:40.173
‐ What did happen
with you and Mam Clanton?

15:41.274 --> 15:43.509
(soft eerie music)

15:44.777 --> 15:46.312
‐ I don't remember.

15:47.747 --> 15:49.749
I only touched her.

15:50.216 --> 15:51.751
Could that have killed her?

15:53.219 --> 15:55.087
‐ You are powerful.

15:55.922 --> 15:58.758
‐ But all I want is to be happy.

15:59.625 --> 16:01.761
I'm engaged.

16:01.794 --> 16:03.930
I'm in love.

16:03.963 --> 16:06.466
I want that for everyone.

16:06.966 --> 16:09.168
Including you.

16:11.003 --> 16:13.139
‐ I know, little lamb.

16:15.541 --> 16:18.010
But we need to know
what happened to Holt's sister.

16:18.044 --> 16:19.912
‐ Maybe Cleo's happy too.

16:19.946 --> 16:21.314
(sinister music)

16:21.347 --> 16:23.616
‐ Maybe somebody
should find out.

16:24.750 --> 16:25.685
(gasping)

16:25.718 --> 16:28.454
‐ Oh, I missed you!
What took you so long?

16:28.488 --> 16:31.624
‐ What was that,
at the police station?

16:31.657 --> 16:34.293
‐ I... love you...

16:34.327 --> 16:37.163
so much. It's like I'm full
of love lava,

16:37.196 --> 16:39.999
and it wants to burst
out of my skin.

16:40.032 --> 16:41.767
I'm Mount Haught.

16:41.801 --> 16:43.336
(birds chirping)

16:43.369 --> 16:46.038
‐ Okay, you were
extra standoffish

16:46.072 --> 16:47.373
until Bunny appeared.

16:47.406 --> 16:50.042
And then, you turned into
a horny octopus!

16:50.076 --> 16:51.544
‐ Baby, I'm gonna die
if you're angry.

16:51.577 --> 16:53.379
Hey!

16:53.412 --> 16:54.647
Look!

16:55.081 --> 16:56.649
Hey!
(chuckling)

16:57.316 --> 16:58.885
‐ Are you possessed again?

16:58.918 --> 17:00.319
‐ What?

17:01.621 --> 17:04.257
Ow! No!

17:04.290 --> 17:06.926
Baby, it's just that...

17:06.959 --> 17:08.261
It's your wedding.

17:08.294 --> 17:11.697
It should have everything
that you want.

17:11.731 --> 17:13.299
You want costume changes!

17:13.332 --> 17:15.768
Or, oh! Sky writing!

17:15.801 --> 17:17.436
‐ Are you making fun of me?

17:18.304 --> 17:20.273
‐ We should release doves.
(car honking)

17:20.306 --> 17:22.008
Or butterflies.

17:22.041 --> 17:25.077
And we need to nail down
a wedding hashtag, like, stat!

17:25.111 --> 17:27.246
‐ Someone's here. I should...

17:27.280 --> 17:30.583
‐ No, but... Hey, hey!
What about WaveNic?

17:30.616 --> 17:31.884
Or Heatwave?

17:31.918 --> 17:34.186
(gasping)
Wayhaught!

17:34.987 --> 17:36.689
No, that's ridiculous.

17:36.722 --> 17:39.859
‐ You cannot marry
Nicole Haught!

17:39.892 --> 17:41.294
‐ Okay, that's enough.

17:41.327 --> 17:43.095
Get your homophobia
off my homestead.

17:43.129 --> 17:46.666
‐ I know I am
an inexperienced gay.

17:46.699 --> 17:49.335
In fact, I haven't really
gayed at all...

17:50.670 --> 17:54.874
But I raided every single
craft store,

17:54.907 --> 17:57.944
and I got you these...

17:57.977 --> 17:59.111
faux‐ses.

17:59.145 --> 18:02.248
Because, Waverly Earp,

18:02.281 --> 18:04.383
I love you.

18:05.051 --> 18:06.852
(stammering)
Nope!

18:06.886 --> 18:09.055
Nope. A whole bunch of nopes.

18:09.088 --> 18:10.823
‐ Oh, oh, oh!
‐ Okay? I'll call you.

18:10.856 --> 18:12.658
‐ But you don't even
have my number.

18:12.692 --> 18:14.860
‐ I definitely do.
‐ No, no, no, you don't!

18:14.894 --> 18:17.396
‐ Yeah, thanks for coming by!
‐ You look so pretty.

18:17.430 --> 18:20.066
You know, I have an old
copy of Bend It Like Beckham.

18:20.099 --> 18:21.267
We can watch it together!

18:21.300 --> 18:23.603
(light music)

18:29.609 --> 18:31.477
I want you to have these.

18:38.918 --> 18:40.553
‐ Bunny Loblaw's hot for you?

18:40.586 --> 18:43.856
‐ It's gotta be a... prank?

18:45.224 --> 18:48.361
‐ Girl. You can get it.

18:48.394 --> 18:51.297
Nobody wants that it,
but you can get it.

18:51.330 --> 18:54.967
‐ How, why am I suddenly
everybody's thing?

18:56.102 --> 18:58.537
‐ Because it's a day
that ends in Y?

18:59.839 --> 19:03.042
‐ Or I made one
hell of a bad bet.

19:16.522 --> 19:19.191
(sniffing, groaning)

19:20.126 --> 19:23.462
‐ Loblaw's into
your flaming ladybug.

19:23.496 --> 19:26.132
‐ Stop.
(Wynonna giggling)

19:26.966 --> 19:30.269
‐ Ooh! That stone‐cold
battle‐axe

19:30.302 --> 19:32.471
wants you to pat the Bunny!

19:32.505 --> 19:33.939
‐ It's not funny.

19:33.973 --> 19:36.676
What if there's something
seriously wrong with her?

19:36.709 --> 19:39.178
‐ Baby girl,
what's wrong with Bunbun...

19:39.211 --> 19:42.048
is she's a homophobic hoe,
and you fixed it

19:42.081 --> 19:44.984
with your magical coochie!
‐ Stop!

19:47.486 --> 19:50.089
‐ Honestly, I am in awe!

19:50.122 --> 19:52.625
Maybe it's that thing
where somebody gets taken

19:52.658 --> 19:55.127
off the market,
and is suddenly more appealing.

19:55.161 --> 19:57.496
‐ Still doesn't explain
how Bunny's suddenly moved

19:57.530 --> 19:58.898
to Sapphic City.

19:58.931 --> 20:02.468
And today has had
an extra serving of whackadoo.

20:02.501 --> 20:03.803
No, first...

20:03.836 --> 20:06.972
Nicole was all over me
with triple X PDA.

20:07.006 --> 20:09.675
And then, I went
to talk to that Amon?

20:09.709 --> 20:11.477
He acted like
we were on a fantasy

20:11.510 --> 20:13.379
overnight episode
of The Bachelorette.

20:14.346 --> 20:16.315
(groaning)
‐ There it is!

20:16.348 --> 20:17.483
(sighing)
‐ What?

20:17.516 --> 20:18.818
‐ It's always a demon.

20:18.851 --> 20:21.053
‐ Oh, no, no, it can't be.

20:21.420 --> 20:23.322
I saw Bunny first.

20:25.257 --> 20:28.294
‐ I'll take care of him.
You stay here.

20:28.327 --> 20:29.795
‐ No, I'm coming.

20:30.362 --> 20:31.831
I have another theory.

20:31.864 --> 20:34.366
(insects chirping)

20:35.701 --> 20:38.337
(soft eerie music)

20:38.370 --> 20:40.806
(flies buzzing)

20:40.840 --> 20:43.409
(suspenseful music)

20:45.211 --> 20:47.113
‐ Lord Almighty.

20:48.748 --> 20:51.350
(distant scuffling)

20:51.383 --> 20:53.119
Who is here?

20:53.786 --> 20:56.856
I will give you until
the count of five.

20:57.456 --> 20:58.824
One...

20:58.858 --> 21:00.960
(fly buzzing continues)

21:00.993 --> 21:02.361
Two...

21:02.394 --> 21:04.463
(gun clicking)

21:04.497 --> 21:06.265
(suspenseful music)

21:09.468 --> 21:11.237
Five.

21:12.371 --> 21:14.073
‐ You here to kill me?

21:14.106 --> 21:15.941
(soft music)

21:16.609 --> 21:19.145
‐ I promised your brother
I would not.

21:20.813 --> 21:23.115
‐ But I want you to.

21:23.149 --> 21:24.583
Please.

21:24.617 --> 21:27.586
Just make the whole thing end.

21:27.620 --> 21:29.488
(crying)

21:29.522 --> 21:31.791
‐ We must tend to whatever's
left of your mother.

21:31.824 --> 21:33.926
‐ I can't!

21:34.660 --> 21:36.929
I need her to tell me
what to do next!

21:37.429 --> 21:39.832
‐ You need to snap out
of whatever this is.

21:39.865 --> 21:41.267
(magical sparkling)

21:50.576 --> 21:52.945
(ethereal music)

21:58.217 --> 22:00.619
Are you fixing to flood
the whole damn county

22:00.653 --> 22:01.587
with them tears, love?

22:01.620 --> 22:04.924
Seeing a girl cry will break
any man's heart.

22:04.957 --> 22:07.927
But when that girl is brave,

22:07.960 --> 22:10.429
tenacious, and fierce?

22:10.462 --> 22:12.431
Well...

22:12.464 --> 22:15.301
You're nearly tearing
this outlaw's heart in two.

22:16.268 --> 22:18.304
(chuckling)

22:18.938 --> 22:21.006
‐ Well, fuck me, that was hot.

22:21.674 --> 22:23.275
‐ Hey elk dicker!

22:23.309 --> 22:25.477
Get your animal eating
ass out here.

22:26.645 --> 22:29.415
‐ In future, you could
start with hello.

22:29.815 --> 22:31.483
‐ Hello.

22:31.517 --> 22:32.885
Fawn Fucker.

22:32.918 --> 22:34.386
‐ I'm not a zoophile.

22:34.420 --> 22:37.289
‐ Beware koalas,
I hear they all have chlamydia.

22:37.323 --> 22:39.491
(magical sparkling)

22:42.828 --> 22:45.931
(ethereal music)

22:50.502 --> 22:52.638
(music droning out)

22:52.671 --> 22:54.940
‐ That word too big for you?

22:54.974 --> 22:56.442
I don't sleep with animals.

22:56.475 --> 23:01.614
‐ Would you consider a slightly
oversexed gunslinger?

23:02.214 --> 23:05.517
I give great...
(inhaling)

23:05.551 --> 23:07.486
...everything.

23:07.519 --> 23:09.221
(knocking)

23:10.189 --> 23:12.258
‐ Don't look!
You'll fall for me!

23:12.291 --> 23:15.361
‐ Someone's been reading
her daily affirmation cards.

23:15.995 --> 23:17.630
‐ It's for your own protection.

23:18.697 --> 23:20.332
‐ I can't fall in love.

23:20.366 --> 23:22.468
‐ Because you don't
believe in it?

23:24.870 --> 23:28.173
‐ Because I am
immune to the spell.

23:28.741 --> 23:30.676
(gasping)
‐ I knew you did it!

23:30.709 --> 23:31.677
‐ Mmm, ooh!

23:31.710 --> 23:34.713
‐ Demetri, I never actually
bet you anything.

23:34.747 --> 23:36.916
Stop making everyone
gaga over me!

23:36.949 --> 23:39.685
‐ Well, they shouldn't
be falling for you.

23:39.718 --> 23:41.287
Not if you're doing it right.

23:41.754 --> 23:43.622
‐ Wait...

23:43.656 --> 23:44.857
I'm doing it?

23:44.890 --> 23:48.527
You said you were
a love professional.

23:48.560 --> 23:51.297
At first I thought that was
some new woke term

23:51.330 --> 23:54.566
for strippers,
but then, I realized.

23:55.200 --> 23:56.702
How did you do this to me?

23:56.735 --> 23:58.704
‐ Ugh, honestly, girl,

23:58.737 --> 24:02.241
don't you ever do your laundry?
Check your pockets.

24:04.777 --> 24:07.746
As far as spells go,
it's stupid easy.

24:07.780 --> 24:10.082
Decide who you think
should fall in love,

24:10.115 --> 24:13.552
and then, flick a little
of your secret sauce on 'em.

24:13.585 --> 24:15.788
‐ Ew. Don't say secret sauce.

24:15.821 --> 24:18.023
‐ Only tricky part is...

24:18.057 --> 24:20.059
make sure the flickee
sees the target

24:20.092 --> 24:23.295
you want them
to fall for immediately.

24:24.096 --> 24:27.433
Because they're all in
on the first person they see.

24:28.801 --> 24:30.602
‐ All in?

24:31.437 --> 24:32.604
(door closing)

24:32.638 --> 24:35.407
‐ I will not sleep with you.

24:36.275 --> 24:39.445
‐ Why?!
Because I'm the Earp heir?

24:40.479 --> 24:41.981
Come here!

24:42.715 --> 24:44.616
‐ Because I love Waverly!

24:44.650 --> 24:45.951
(techno music playing)

24:45.985 --> 24:47.753
(stammering): What?

24:47.786 --> 24:49.755
‐ She's just, she's so pure,

24:49.788 --> 24:51.323
and she's so genuine.

24:51.357 --> 24:53.826
She's so much cuter
than the cutest of buttons.

24:53.859 --> 24:55.094
‐ Since when is that your thing?

24:55.127 --> 24:58.263
‐ Right? I mean, Doc is usually
at the top of my lust chart.

24:58.297 --> 25:00.966
I mean, the man is a universal
arousal architect.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.368
‐ No, I am! I am!

25:02.401 --> 25:05.738
‐ But the heart
is a demanding master.

25:05.771 --> 25:08.440
And mine only wants your sister.

25:08.474 --> 25:10.275
‐ My engagement party
is tonight.

25:10.309 --> 25:13.345
I can't do this job.
I don't want to.

25:13.379 --> 25:15.147
‐ That's why I moved
into delivery.

25:15.180 --> 25:16.815
Better tips, better hours,

25:16.849 --> 25:18.550
and you're allowed
to eat the fries

25:18.584 --> 25:20.085
that fall out of the bag.

25:21.887 --> 25:24.656
‐ Also, this spell
ignores consent!

25:25.991 --> 25:27.726
‐ You know...

25:28.327 --> 25:31.096
You moderns
are so single‐minded.

25:31.130 --> 25:33.665
There's all kinds of love!

25:33.699 --> 25:34.967
Sex doesn't enter the equation

25:35.000 --> 25:37.002
unless that's what
the client really wants.

25:38.370 --> 25:39.705
Mm‐mm.

25:39.738 --> 25:41.340
(birds chirping)

25:42.574 --> 25:45.344
‐ What if I bury
the glitter and just go?

25:45.744 --> 25:47.312
‐ Cupids...

25:47.346 --> 25:50.215
can only quit if they
pass it on by choice.

25:51.016 --> 25:53.118
‐ A Cupid?

25:53.619 --> 25:55.487
Those were wing scars.

25:55.521 --> 25:57.823
‐ I had them removed.
So over the top.

25:57.856 --> 26:01.160
‐ You were a Cupid and you
stopped believing in love?

26:01.193 --> 26:03.295
‐ Oh, also...

26:03.328 --> 26:06.665
Be prepared to keep explaining
why you're not a fat baby.

26:06.698 --> 26:09.501
You know, stereotypes!

26:10.803 --> 26:12.337
Ta‐ta!

26:16.708 --> 26:18.010
‐ So you're saying...

26:18.043 --> 26:19.311
That's how you spread the love,

26:19.344 --> 26:21.046
with that little
jar of sparkles?

26:21.480 --> 26:23.082
‐ Yeah, I have to figure out
a way

26:23.115 --> 26:25.417
to responsibly pass it on.

26:26.151 --> 26:29.021
I... I can't skip my own party!

26:29.054 --> 26:31.423
Nicole has a surprise for me.

26:31.457 --> 26:33.358
I'm scared.
(snickering)

26:33.392 --> 26:35.094
‐ Fifty bucks says she got
your name tattooed

26:35.127 --> 26:36.495
across her boobs.

26:37.162 --> 26:41.133
Which are so great, right?

26:41.166 --> 26:43.268
‐ What did you call her boobs?

26:43.302 --> 26:44.903
‐ I'm not in love with her,
don't freak.

26:44.937 --> 26:48.207
I'm just... making sure
that you are...

26:48.740 --> 26:50.242
still...

26:50.275 --> 26:52.444
into boobs, generally.

26:55.180 --> 26:57.116
‐ Wynonna?
‐ Yes?

26:57.149 --> 26:59.718
‐ You sure you haven't had
any love zombie symptoms?

26:59.751 --> 27:01.687
‐ Nope. Nothin' but net.

27:01.720 --> 27:03.555
‐ Hmm.

27:03.922 --> 27:06.725
Maybe you're resistant
to the spell.

27:07.426 --> 27:09.394
‐ More like looked in the mirror

27:09.428 --> 27:12.865
and fell for the actual
hottest woman around.

27:12.898 --> 27:14.933
‐ Good Golden Globes!

27:14.967 --> 27:16.902
You know Doc's not coming,
right?

27:16.969 --> 27:18.670
(scoffing)
‐ Who?

27:19.238 --> 27:24.243
Listen, the only problem
you really have is...

27:24.276 --> 27:25.744
people adore you,

27:25.777 --> 27:27.713
which must be so hard.

27:28.380 --> 27:30.282
Can I borrow some mascara?

27:30.616 --> 27:32.084
‐ Yeah, sure.

27:32.117 --> 27:34.620
‐ Listen, just leave
that glitter shit here.

27:34.653 --> 27:35.587
It'll be safe,

27:35.621 --> 27:37.756
and we'll find a fat baby
to curse tomorrow.

27:37.789 --> 27:39.525
Oops!

27:43.128 --> 27:45.230
(Waverly sighs)
‐ Okay.

27:48.667 --> 27:50.102
Hey.
‐ Hey!

27:50.135 --> 27:52.171
‐ Shall we go celebrate?
(gasping)

27:52.204 --> 27:53.872
‐ I am so ready.

27:54.473 --> 27:57.476
The big guns
are locked and loaded.

28:06.218 --> 28:07.886
‐ Hi everyo‐‐ ahh!

28:07.920 --> 28:10.355
‐ Hello, fiancée,
who is marrying me.

28:10.389 --> 28:13.559
Welcome to our engagement party.

28:14.560 --> 28:16.562
‐ Bunny! I wasn't expecting you.

28:16.595 --> 28:18.063
‐ Yeah, nice blazer.

28:18.664 --> 28:20.065
‐ You didn't call.

28:20.098 --> 28:22.267
I got two phones
with the exact same number

28:22.301 --> 28:23.268
so I didn't miss you.

28:24.636 --> 28:26.271
‐ And Amon too!

28:26.305 --> 28:27.873
‐ Well, your sister mentioned

28:27.906 --> 28:29.341
‐ Ow!
‐ ...the party, and I thought...

28:29.374 --> 28:31.843
maybe I might be of service.

28:31.877 --> 28:33.879
‐ Raise your hand
if you need servicing.

28:33.912 --> 28:36.081
‐ I'd like to hit that.
‐ Uh...

28:39.218 --> 28:40.719
Bunny? Come with me.

28:41.520 --> 28:44.790
‐ This is your sister's
engagement party.

28:44.823 --> 28:46.291
Did you have to go
full on whore?

28:46.325 --> 28:48.393
‐ I do look great. Nedley?

28:48.427 --> 28:50.762
Get Bunny a nice
glass of water, okay?

28:51.196 --> 28:52.998
(whispering): Give her
all the boozes, alright?

28:53.031 --> 28:55.133
Get her so sloshed
she thinks she's Jann Arden.

28:55.567 --> 28:57.703
(upbeat music playing)

28:57.736 --> 29:00.072
(magical sparkling)

29:03.742 --> 29:06.578
(ethereal music)

29:09.548 --> 29:11.883
(music droning out)

29:11.917 --> 29:14.886
‐ Cheese and crackers, Bonita.

29:14.920 --> 29:17.422
You know, you haven't looked
this great since church camp.

29:17.456 --> 29:18.857
You get your hair done?

29:24.296 --> 29:25.864
‐ And that's when I knew...

29:25.897 --> 29:28.967
not only was I going to win
the bullfight,

29:29.001 --> 29:32.404
but I was gonna become
Spain's champion matador.

29:32.437 --> 29:34.239
‐ She's a vegan.

29:34.273 --> 29:35.741
(gasping)
‐ Amon?

29:35.774 --> 29:39.177
I am extremely interested
in bull riding.

29:39.211 --> 29:41.613
Or being ridden like one.

29:41.647 --> 29:42.648
‐ Okay!

29:42.681 --> 29:44.683
Why are you doing this?

29:45.450 --> 29:47.419
‐ Because Waverly's never
inviting you

29:47.452 --> 29:49.788
to motorboat in her marina!

29:49.821 --> 29:51.890
‐ Wynonna!
‐ Everybody loves Waverly!

29:51.923 --> 29:54.559
It's always Waverly,
Waverly, Waverly!

29:54.593 --> 29:55.994
(Bunny over speakers):
Excuse me?

29:56.028 --> 29:58.597
This is a love song,
and I am sending it out

29:58.630 --> 30:02.167
to... the most beautiful
woman in the world.

30:02.200 --> 30:03.402
‐ Zoë Kravitz?

30:03.435 --> 30:04.836
‐ Waverly Earp.

30:04.870 --> 30:07.205
‐ Oh, God.
(Wynonna whines)

30:07.239 --> 30:07.939
(guitar melody)

30:07.973 --> 30:10.442
♪ How do you cool your lips ♪

30:10.475 --> 30:12.444
(Amon grumbling)
‐ Hey, hey!

30:12.477 --> 30:16.381
♪ After a summer's kiss ♪

30:17.949 --> 30:20.452
♪ How do you... ♪
(whispering): Stop it!

30:20.485 --> 30:21.653
‐ Wait!

30:21.687 --> 30:23.822
‐ I don't know.
‐ Oh, my God.

30:23.855 --> 30:27.426
♪ After the body bliss ♪

30:27.459 --> 30:28.694
(insects chirping)

30:28.727 --> 30:32.064
‐ Mam said everyone associated
with the Earps were all evil,

30:32.097 --> 30:34.833
and that all you wanted
was for us to die.

30:35.834 --> 30:39.304
‐ My mama, Alice, taught me
if a worthy person needs help,

30:39.338 --> 30:41.106
you help.

30:41.139 --> 30:43.141
(Cleo chuckles)

30:44.176 --> 30:45.677
‐ Worthy?

30:45.711 --> 30:49.181
She had big plans.
A legacy to fulfill.

30:49.881 --> 30:53.051
And now I'm too stupid
and too alone to fulfill them.

30:53.085 --> 30:54.820
(soft music)

30:56.221 --> 30:58.123
(birds chirping)

31:00.492 --> 31:02.461
‐ You look at yourself.

31:03.395 --> 31:05.364
‐ I hate my stupid face.

31:06.531 --> 31:08.333
‐ Your eyes are sharp.

31:08.367 --> 31:10.969
That is where the beauty is.

31:11.770 --> 31:13.271
You survived.

31:14.172 --> 31:16.341
And no vindictive
old woman's words

31:16.375 --> 31:17.976
can take that away from you.

31:18.009 --> 31:20.479
It's your turn to do
whatever you want,

31:20.512 --> 31:22.381
on your terms.

31:23.682 --> 31:25.884
Be your own legacy, Cleo.

31:33.525 --> 31:35.260
‐ Why are you helping me?

31:36.928 --> 31:39.064
‐ It's what I do.

31:41.333 --> 31:43.468
I'm a damn good sidekick.

31:44.903 --> 31:47.239
(birds chirping)

31:47.906 --> 31:49.708
(Bunny singing)

31:49.741 --> 31:52.244
(Bunny and Nedley singing):
Insensitive!

31:53.211 --> 31:55.380
‐ Hey, hey, hey!
‐ I, too, have a song.

31:55.414 --> 31:57.349
‐ You don't come in
on Bunny's territory!

31:57.382 --> 32:00.452
(Nicole singing): Oh I love you,
love you, love you...

32:00.485 --> 32:01.920
(overlapping arguing)

32:01.953 --> 32:04.756
(Wynonna singing): Ride my bull!

32:05.290 --> 32:08.326
(Bunny): Guys, you're ruining
everything!

32:08.360 --> 32:09.928
(clattering)

32:09.961 --> 32:11.997
(suspenseful music)

32:13.265 --> 32:14.866
‐ Nedley.

32:14.900 --> 32:16.368
(singing, shouting)

32:16.401 --> 32:19.571
(arguing continues)

32:19.604 --> 32:21.273
(Bunny): You're ruining
everything!

32:23.442 --> 32:24.910
(clattering)

32:24.943 --> 32:26.344
(whispering): I need your help.

32:26.378 --> 32:28.013
(Nicole): Waverly?
‐ Turns out I've been passing on

32:28.046 --> 32:29.881
a love disease!
(overlapping background chatter)

32:29.915 --> 32:31.950
No! Not that kind
of love disease!

32:31.983 --> 32:33.418
‐ Baby, do you need help?

32:33.452 --> 32:35.787
‐ This one gives people
insane feelings of adoration

32:35.821 --> 32:38.323
for the next person they see.
‐ Waverly, I know you want it.

32:38.356 --> 32:41.026
‐ I need you to come down to
Shorty's. Please!

32:41.059 --> 32:43.495
You're the only one unaffected!

32:44.396 --> 32:46.231
(excited squealing)

32:46.765 --> 32:49.901
‐ Nobody has ever
talked to me like that.

32:50.602 --> 32:52.170
‐ I should be on my way.

32:52.204 --> 32:53.972
‐ It makes me happy
that Mam and Nicole's

32:54.005 --> 32:56.441
covenant for you went bust.
‐ Nicole?

32:56.475 --> 32:57.609
(suspenseful music)

32:57.642 --> 32:59.144
‐ Yeah.

32:59.911 --> 33:02.314
Mam helped her get Waverly

33:02.347 --> 33:03.949
out of the garden,

33:03.982 --> 33:06.117
in exchange for...

33:06.151 --> 33:08.220
well, you.

33:09.354 --> 33:10.589
(Doc exhales)

33:11.623 --> 33:13.558
‐ I understand.

33:13.592 --> 33:15.861
Unfortunately.

33:17.629 --> 33:19.831
(birds chirping)

33:21.099 --> 33:25.003
(car door opens and closes)

33:29.341 --> 33:31.443
(car starts)

33:31.476 --> 33:33.545
(suspenseful music)

33:36.848 --> 33:39.351
(soft eerie music)

33:48.059 --> 33:49.961
(chain clanking)

33:50.562 --> 33:52.464
(low growling)

33:59.504 --> 34:00.972
(screaming)

34:01.006 --> 34:03.108
‐ The hummus!
I hand squished it myself!

34:03.141 --> 34:05.010
‐ Get your bean hands
off of my guitar!

34:05.043 --> 34:07.279
‐ A lady should not
have to ask twice.

34:07.312 --> 34:09.180
(Bunny): Randy,
you're not helping!

34:09.214 --> 34:11.683
(Nicole): Stay out of this!
(overlapping chatter)

34:11.716 --> 34:13.518
‐ Doc! Thank Eros.

34:13.552 --> 34:16.454
‐ That is so hot!
‐ Can't we just be friends?

34:16.488 --> 34:19.257
‐ Well, don't just stand there,
distract Wynonna!

34:19.291 --> 34:21.493
‐ I'd rather not.
(balloons popping)

34:21.526 --> 34:22.961
‐ Damn it, Doc!

34:22.994 --> 34:25.430
‐ Alright, by grabs.

34:25.463 --> 34:27.198
(overlapping arguing)

34:27.232 --> 34:31.503
‐ Excuse me, I've got an online
order here for a Waverly Earp?

34:31.536 --> 34:33.038
‐ Demetri! Hi!

34:33.071 --> 34:34.706
‐ ...karaokier!
‐ Guys!

34:34.739 --> 34:37.409
‐ Look what we've done!
‐ Where's the sparkle jar?

34:37.442 --> 34:38.577
‐ I left it at home.

34:38.610 --> 34:41.346
‐ Ow! Stop it!

34:41.379 --> 34:42.547
‐ You may have...

34:42.581 --> 34:43.848
‐ I'm giving you a golden shower

34:43.882 --> 34:44.716
whether you like it or not!

34:44.749 --> 34:47.352
‐ Wyno... No!

34:47.385 --> 34:49.254
‐ Ah!
‐ Whoa!

34:50.121 --> 34:52.324
(magical sparkling)

34:52.357 --> 34:55.327
(bright music)

35:12.043 --> 35:14.846
with the greatest gunslinger
that ever lived.

35:14.879 --> 35:16.348
Doc mother‐kissing Holliday.

35:16.381 --> 35:19.250
‐ Are you kidding?
I cannot believe I am amigos

35:19.284 --> 35:22.921
with four‐time curling champion
Randy Nedley.

35:22.954 --> 35:24.122
I love you.

35:24.155 --> 35:27.993
‐ You hiding a fluffy little
bunny tail in those slacks?

35:28.026 --> 35:29.628
‐ You wanna check?

35:29.661 --> 35:30.962
‐ You know, I suddenly wonder,

35:30.996 --> 35:32.130
if you weren't gonna be
my sister‐in‐law,

35:32.163 --> 35:34.733
could we do things?
‐ Mmm, Nicole.

35:34.766 --> 35:37.369
I love you more than whisky.

35:37.402 --> 35:39.638
But I think you're driving
this bus somewhere

35:39.671 --> 35:40.739
we don't want it to go.

35:40.772 --> 35:42.941
‐ Your spit destroys love?

35:42.974 --> 35:45.410
‐ The universe craves balance.

35:45.443 --> 35:47.379
‐ You could've just
told me that!

35:47.412 --> 35:49.347
‐ Should we get naked anyway?

35:49.381 --> 35:53.451
Just for... science.
‐ Okie dokie...

35:54.085 --> 35:57.255
Can I cut in? Hmm...

36:01.559 --> 36:03.094
‐ I cannot.

36:04.095 --> 36:06.297
Sorry brother, may I?

36:06.331 --> 36:07.932
(sighing)

36:07.966 --> 36:09.701
(chuckling)

36:13.405 --> 36:16.107
(soft music)

36:20.111 --> 36:23.081
‐ I can almost see
the love vibrating off them.

36:23.114 --> 36:24.783
(Demetri): It's fake, pumpkin.

36:24.816 --> 36:27.552
Your insane sister caused it
with a glitter bomb.

36:28.119 --> 36:30.221
‐ You're always so...

36:31.856 --> 36:33.191
...sad.

36:34.025 --> 36:35.427
Wait.

36:35.460 --> 36:38.363
Not just sad.

36:40.598 --> 36:42.667
What was their name?

36:46.671 --> 36:48.306
‐ Amon.

36:48.339 --> 36:49.507
‐ What?

36:49.541 --> 36:51.009
‐ Yeah.

36:51.042 --> 36:54.345
After two years,
he changed the locks.

36:55.213 --> 36:57.682
He said I bored him.

36:59.384 --> 37:02.520
‐ Your heartbreak proved
that love...

37:03.588 --> 37:05.457
does exist.

37:06.224 --> 37:09.861
And their love for one another,
it's not fake.

37:09.894 --> 37:13.631
It just gets buried day‐to‐day

37:14.466 --> 37:16.167
under hurt...

37:16.835 --> 37:18.803
and pride.

37:18.837 --> 37:21.740
It doesn't always last forever,

37:21.773 --> 37:23.808
but it's real.

37:23.842 --> 37:25.143
(scoffing)

37:27.879 --> 37:29.280
‐ Fine.

37:29.314 --> 37:30.982
I'll take the Cupid power back.

37:31.015 --> 37:33.852
But you have to help me
unmess your mess.

37:33.885 --> 37:35.553
‐ Fine.

37:35.587 --> 37:37.188
‐ Aim for the butts.

37:37.756 --> 37:39.257
Love lives in the butt.

37:39.290 --> 37:41.126
(sinister music)
‐ Who's there?

37:41.159 --> 37:43.161
(deep voice): Rachel?
‐ Billy?

37:43.194 --> 37:45.296
‐ I want to go home.

37:45.930 --> 37:47.031
(spitting)

37:47.065 --> 37:49.601
(soft music playing)

37:53.638 --> 37:55.440
(spitting)

37:57.909 --> 37:59.778
‐ I don't want to let go.

38:10.522 --> 38:11.623
(spitting)

38:12.123 --> 38:13.892
‐ Ah.
(spitting)

38:14.959 --> 38:16.861
Well, this is weird.

38:16.895 --> 38:17.929
‐ Understatement.

38:17.962 --> 38:20.098
(spitting)
‐ Ow! Randy!

38:20.131 --> 38:21.332
(Demetri): Oh, nailed it!

38:21.366 --> 38:24.536
‐ Oh, we can never
speak of this again.

38:26.938 --> 38:29.040
(snorting)

38:29.073 --> 38:30.241
(laughing)

38:30.275 --> 38:31.242
(door closes)

38:31.276 --> 38:32.644
‐ Yes!
‐ We did it!

38:34.245 --> 38:35.914
(laughing)

38:35.947 --> 38:39.317
‐ So, I don't exactly understand
what happened, but...

38:40.118 --> 38:42.453
You still seem
to love me, so...

38:43.221 --> 38:45.557
‐ I do.
(door closes)

38:45.590 --> 38:48.660
And I think we settled
on a medium fussy wedding.

38:48.693 --> 38:50.128
‐ Perfect.

38:50.161 --> 38:52.230
(giggling)

38:53.765 --> 38:55.166
‐ Well...

38:55.200 --> 38:57.669
I chose you, Waverly Earp,

38:57.702 --> 39:00.605
because I hadn't seen anyone
this in love.

39:00.638 --> 39:04.943
Not since... forever.
(cell phone ringing)

39:04.976 --> 39:07.879
Yeah? Get off my ass, Marty.

39:07.912 --> 39:10.949
Alright? Yeah, their burgers
are coming in a sec.

39:10.982 --> 39:12.183
Yeah, they're still warm!

39:13.284 --> 39:15.820
‐ Whichever one of us kids
became Clanton heir...

39:15.854 --> 39:19.991
you planned for us to turn you
into a Reaper, right?

39:20.024 --> 39:21.993
To join those we'd lost.

39:22.026 --> 39:24.729
And together, we'd avenge
our name.

39:26.798 --> 39:28.967
And I will do that, Mam.

39:29.000 --> 39:30.602
(flies buzzing)

39:30.635 --> 39:32.270
I'll destroy them.

39:32.303 --> 39:34.973
All of them,
just like you wanted.

39:37.876 --> 39:40.478
But you're never gonna see it.

39:40.511 --> 39:42.680
Did you really think
I'd forgive you

39:42.714 --> 39:44.215
for killing Billy?

39:44.249 --> 39:46.985
(intense music)

39:47.018 --> 39:48.686
Dinner, everybody!
(growling)

39:48.720 --> 39:51.356
Who's ready for some
rotten old bitch?

39:51.389 --> 39:54.292
(creatures screeching)

40:02.200 --> 40:03.334
‐ Okay. Hey, Bunny!

40:03.368 --> 40:05.470
Do you need us to give you
a ride home?

40:05.503 --> 40:07.772
‐ What, do you think I'm drunk?
I am drunk.

40:07.805 --> 40:10.041
I'm as drunk as a bum
the day the cheques come out!

40:10.074 --> 40:11.409
‐ Oh, boy.

40:11.442 --> 40:12.810
‐ You guys are really,
really special.

40:12.844 --> 40:15.046
And the love you have
for each other is...

40:15.079 --> 40:16.114
nothing short of inspiring.

40:16.147 --> 40:19.384
‐ Oh. That actually means
a lot that you said that.

40:19.417 --> 40:21.286
‐ Yeah, it'd mean a lot more
if she meant it.

40:21.319 --> 40:22.587
‐ No, no, no. I mean it.

40:22.620 --> 40:24.923
Anyone that doesn't think so...

40:24.956 --> 40:28.393
Just because you share
four breasts...

40:29.360 --> 40:31.696
they're a bunch of dumdums.

40:31.729 --> 40:32.997
(chuckling)

40:33.031 --> 40:34.999
‐ You sure we can't
give you a ride home?

40:35.033 --> 40:37.402
‐ Randy Nedley is going
to give me a ride home.

40:37.902 --> 40:39.504
‐ Oh!

40:40.104 --> 40:42.373
‐ Well, have a nice evening,
lesbians.

40:42.407 --> 40:44.208
‐ Uh, Waverly's bisexual.

40:44.242 --> 40:46.878
‐ Yeah, well, just say horny.

40:49.380 --> 40:51.582
‐ And she's back.

40:51.616 --> 40:52.784
(door opens and closes)

40:53.918 --> 40:56.120
‐ Surely there are other bars
for you to drink in.

40:57.322 --> 40:58.690
(weapon powering up)

40:58.723 --> 41:01.025
‐ I came for the entertainment.

41:01.059 --> 41:03.061
(upbeat music playing)

41:04.495 --> 41:06.698
‐ Now there's the Earp sister
I like.

41:06.731 --> 41:09.968
Hazardous, hot, half‐in‐the‐bag.

41:13.271 --> 41:15.373
‐ I wasn't sure
if you'd be alone.

41:15.406 --> 41:17.141
‐ Demetri?

41:17.742 --> 41:20.945
He left after I let him
yell some nonsense

41:20.979 --> 41:23.915
about how I have no soul.

41:25.016 --> 41:26.884
‐ Hmm.
(Wynonna chuckles)

41:28.286 --> 41:29.887
Been there.

41:31.756 --> 41:33.424
Hated it.

41:34.926 --> 41:38.730
‐ I was mostly bored.
I guess I am a monster.

41:41.199 --> 41:43.067
‐ Who gives a fuck?

41:45.403 --> 41:47.105
‐ I thought you wanted
to kill me.

41:47.138 --> 41:49.540
‐ All I want is...

41:49.574 --> 41:53.444
to stop feeling guilty
for what I am.

41:55.179 --> 41:57.348
When what I am...

41:57.382 --> 41:59.584
is necessary.

42:00.385 --> 42:03.021
‐ You're a...

42:03.054 --> 42:05.123
You're a confusing woman.

42:08.092 --> 42:09.894
‐ Flexible, too.

42:16.167 --> 42:17.468
Are you gonna tell me

42:17.502 --> 42:20.004
you're in love
with my sister now?

42:22.640 --> 42:24.675
‐ No, ma'am.
‐ Good.

42:26.577 --> 42:28.980
Now show me how you
ride that bull.

42:29.013 --> 42:30.548
(Amon gasps)

42:43.828 --> 42:45.496
‐ Billy?

42:47.432 --> 42:50.635
Welcome home, little brother.

42:52.804 --> 42:55.840
It's time we took back
what's ours.
