00:05.734 --> 00:08.367
I'm back, bitches!
[laughing]

00:08.400 --> 00:13.233
I wanna look like a cartoon.
Pixie character,
pointy nose, pointy ear.

00:13.266 --> 00:15.367
I never really felt human.

00:15.400 --> 00:19.400
I would call Pixee
a living, breathing,
walking, talking work of art.

00:19.433 --> 00:22.233
I have invented some [bleep]
here. It's deep.

00:22.266 --> 00:24.767
Are you ready?
It's deep?

00:25.000 --> 00:27.767
I have a lot of baggage
under my eyes.

00:28.000 --> 00:32.100
The issue with the eye is
it's really deeply attached
to the muscle.

00:32.133 --> 00:37.100
If you damage that muscle,
she might not be able to blink
properly or close her eyes.

00:37.133 --> 00:41.233
My left breast was a bit firm.

00:41.266 --> 00:44.533
First and foremost--
Baseball titties.

00:44.567 --> 00:47.533
What is this
coming out of her breast?

00:47.567 --> 00:51.133
I've never seen this before
in a cosmetic breast case.

00:51.166 --> 00:53.467
Hey, what is this stuff?

00:53.500 --> 00:56.567
[woman]
It feels like putty.

01:12.166 --> 01:15.000
I'm back, bitches!
[laughing]

01:15.033 --> 01:20.066
Since last time I was here,
I had more than 20
plastic surgery procedures

01:20.100 --> 01:23.333
on my quest to become
a living cartoon.

01:23.367 --> 01:26.567
Surgeries that I know
Dr. Nassif and Dr. Dubrow

01:26.600 --> 01:28.533
would never perform on me.

01:28.567 --> 01:31.433
You're gonna look deformed--
cartoonish

01:31.467 --> 01:34.066
in a goofy,
ugly, unattractive way.

01:35.300 --> 01:37.667
This time, maybe they could try
to open up

01:37.700 --> 01:41.166
and see a little bit
of my vision and my life.

01:41.200 --> 01:43.300
I used to be more of a tomboy.

01:43.333 --> 01:46.200
I used to be an electrician.
I was only doing guy stuff.

01:46.233 --> 01:51.033
And now I'm transforming myself
from a normal girl
to a living cartoon.

01:51.066 --> 01:53.200
I never really felt human.

01:53.233 --> 01:56.567
I always felt more like a pixie,
like a fantasy creature.

01:56.600 --> 02:00.200
And I travel far to be able
to achieve this look.

02:00.233 --> 02:03.233
Just in the last year,
I have been all over the world.

02:03.266 --> 02:05.667
I've been to Iran.
I've been to India.

02:05.700 --> 02:08.333
I've been to Istanbul.
I've been to Korea.

02:08.367 --> 02:11.667
I've been to Dubai.
I've been to Sweden.
I've been all around America.

02:11.700 --> 02:16.266
Anything you can or can't
think of in plastic surgery,
I've had it.

02:16.300 --> 02:20.166
I've had more than 200
plastic surgery procedures.

02:20.200 --> 02:22.600
I have invented
my own procedures.

02:22.633 --> 02:26.266
So I'm the only girl
in the world ever to do

02:26.300 --> 02:30.066
an eyelash transplant with my
[clears throat]
pubic hairs.

02:30.100 --> 02:31.467
[laughs]

02:31.500 --> 02:34.166
I was the first documented case
in the world

02:34.200 --> 02:36.133
ever to remove six of my ribs.

02:36.166 --> 02:38.667
I'm also one of the few people
in the world that done

02:38.700 --> 02:41.667
a rare genital
beautification surgery.

02:41.700 --> 02:44.633
It is also known
as a double-pussy procedure.

02:44.667 --> 02:49.734
You cut the complete inner,
and then you add fat
to the outer to close it.

02:49.767 --> 02:52.333
And then you tighten it up
and make it smaller.

02:52.367 --> 02:54.333
Everywhere...
[laughing]

02:54.367 --> 02:57.667
You basically tuck it in
and make it more pretty
and cute and beautiful.

02:57.700 --> 03:00.600
Flower.
[laughs]

03:00.633 --> 03:06.233
So my most recent surgery
was a little bit more
than one month ago.

03:06.266 --> 03:08.734
I went to South Korea
to do a complete

03:08.767 --> 03:12.467
facial bone reconstruction
and a V-line surgery.

03:12.500 --> 03:15.500
They basically broke
every bone in my face

03:15.533 --> 03:19.500
and repositioned it
by making my face smaller,

03:19.533 --> 03:21.700
which is gonna make my eyes pop
and look bigger.

03:21.734 --> 03:24.700
I wanted to look like a cartoon
or anime face.

03:24.734 --> 03:29.533
Dr. Nassif and Dr. Dubrow
are two of the most
qualified surgeons.

03:29.567 --> 03:35.467
I have one last wish--
a small surgery
that I think they can do for me.

03:35.500 --> 03:40.133
After having two brow lifts,
my forehead is now too high,

03:40.166 --> 03:42.467
and I want to lower it slightly.

03:42.500 --> 03:47.533
It will complete
the cartoon symmetry of my face.

03:47.567 --> 03:50.266
My name is Nuray,
I'm 34 years old,

03:50.300 --> 03:53.300
and I have a lot of baggage
under my eyes.

03:53.333 --> 03:55.266
I grew up in Istanbul, Turkey.

03:55.300 --> 03:57.333
I was very bubbly, outgoing,

03:57.367 --> 03:59.700
always liked to be center
of attention.

03:59.734 --> 04:03.266
I've been promo model
since 19 years old.

04:03.300 --> 04:07.300
Promo model is basically
an ambassador for a brand.

04:07.333 --> 04:09.734
Eleven years ago,
I moved to Las Vegas

04:09.767 --> 04:12.433
because there are a lot
of trade shows in Las Vegas.

04:12.467 --> 04:14.467
This is very competitive job.

04:14.500 --> 04:16.767
So working with
a lot of young girls

04:17.000 --> 04:20.467
make me feel like
I should appear younger.

04:20.500 --> 04:25.000
I thought I should
maybe get fillers
to make a fuller look.

04:25.033 --> 04:27.300
I went to Turkey
to visit my family.

04:27.333 --> 04:30.567
We had a family friend
just had her tummy tuck,

04:30.600 --> 04:34.433
and she asked me to go with her
for her post-op.

04:34.467 --> 04:39.467
So I went with her
and asked her doctor
about the fillers.

04:39.500 --> 04:42.734
She suggested taking fat
from my abdomen

04:42.767 --> 04:45.433
to put under my eyes
so it's gonna last longer.

04:45.467 --> 04:50.667
So, when I woke up,
I immediately knew
that something was wrong.

04:50.700 --> 04:55.600
My eyes was swollen terribly,
and one eye was bigger
than the other.

04:55.633 --> 05:00.734
My doctor explained me
that she put 3cc on one eye
and 2cc one eye.

05:00.767 --> 05:05.266
She said she was trying
to put the fat in,
and my body was rejecting it.

05:05.300 --> 05:10.400
So I was like,
"Why do you even push the fat
if my body was rejecting?"

05:10.433 --> 05:13.333
Later on, I learned that
she doesn't have any experience.

05:13.367 --> 05:16.400
She use me as a guinea pig.

05:16.433 --> 05:21.734
I was getting a lot of jobs
before the surgery,
and it just stop.

05:21.767 --> 05:25.300
I didn't wanna accept
that I lose my job,

05:25.333 --> 05:28.000
so I start to apply
with my old pictures.

05:28.033 --> 05:29.734
I don't look like
my pictures anymore.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.600
Then I got hired.

05:31.633 --> 05:34.467
The first day of the job
was hard for me

05:34.500 --> 05:37.033
because I was so scared
that they were
gonna send me home.

05:37.066 --> 05:41.633
And it happened. They said,
"Oh, we don't need you today.
It's very slow day."

05:41.667 --> 05:45.633
I knew that it was because
of my surgery.

05:45.667 --> 05:48.667
[sniffles, mutters]

05:54.033 --> 05:58.500
I tried everything.
I visited more than 20 doctors.

05:58.533 --> 06:00.500
I tried cold press.

06:00.533 --> 06:03.400
I tried cryotherapy.

06:03.433 --> 06:06.233
I slept two months
sitting position

06:06.266 --> 06:10.400
because I thought
the swelling was gonna go down
if you sleep that way.

06:10.433 --> 06:13.567
But it didn't help
because it wasn't swollen.

06:13.600 --> 06:18.300
Dr. Nassif and Dr. Dubrow--
my last chance.

06:18.333 --> 06:20.467
I believe that they can fix me.

06:24.066 --> 06:26.300
[Dr. Nassif]
Thanks for inviting me
to your house the other day.

06:26.333 --> 06:28.100
[Dr. Dubrow] You're welcome.
That was fun.
The food was good.

06:28.133 --> 06:31.000
The cocktails--
Actually, I didn't drink much.

06:31.033 --> 06:33.300
You don't drink much?
I was already buzzed
when I came over.

06:33.333 --> 06:35.633
You were lit--
What do they call it?
"Lit AF"?

06:35.667 --> 06:37.400
Do you know what that means?
"Lit AF"?
No.

06:37.433 --> 06:39.066
No. What's "AF"?
You have no idea
what that means?

06:39.100 --> 06:40.734
What? "After the fact,"
or something?
No, no, no.

06:40.767 --> 06:42.700
Lit as...
Oh.

06:42.734 --> 06:44.100
Yes. Lit AF.

06:44.133 --> 06:46.100
Paul, the reason you don't know

06:46.133 --> 06:49.767
what "lit AF" means
is because you're old AF.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.533
We have a patient named Nuray.
Yeah?

06:51.567 --> 06:55.100
Apparently had some facial
fat grafting--
Right.

06:55.133 --> 06:57.533
...and now has a problem,
and she is coming here
to see us.

06:57.567 --> 06:59.033
Okay.
Let's take a look at the photos.

06:59.066 --> 07:01.567
[both]
Ooh!

07:01.600 --> 07:04.100
So that looks like
superficial fat grafting.

07:04.133 --> 07:06.600
Yeah.
Too close to the skin.
Look at that.

07:06.633 --> 07:08.066
Can you please send in Nuray?

07:09.433 --> 07:10.734
Hello.
Nice to meet you.

07:10.767 --> 07:13.000
Nice to meet you.
Nuray, I'm Terry Dubrow.

07:13.033 --> 07:14.567
How are you?
Nice to meet you.

07:14.600 --> 07:17.433
My biggest fear
is they will say,

07:17.467 --> 07:19.500
"No, Nuray, we cannot help you."

07:19.533 --> 07:22.700
So, what happened?
Why'd you even do
whatever you did?

07:22.734 --> 07:24.767
I've been modeling
for 15 years now.

07:25.000 --> 07:28.533
And all these young girls--
19 years old, 20 years old--

07:28.567 --> 07:30.333
were taking over my job.

07:30.367 --> 07:34.433
And I wanted to have
some fillers around my eye.

07:34.467 --> 07:37.700
I went to Turkey a year ago,
and I talked to this doctor.

07:37.734 --> 07:42.133
She said, "If we put fat
inside of fillers,
it's gonna last longer."

07:42.166 --> 07:45.667
So, at that point, you decided,
"Okay, I'm gonna do it."

07:45.700 --> 07:47.400
"I'm gonna do it.
It's easy"...

07:47.433 --> 07:50.133
She told me in ten days
I can go back to work.

07:50.166 --> 07:52.433
Because I mentioned,
"In 15 days,
I have a trade show.

07:52.467 --> 07:53.767
I need to go back
two weeks."
Mm.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.734
In twenty days, swelling
wasn't going down at all.

07:56.767 --> 07:59.467
Did you see other doctors
about this?

07:59.500 --> 08:02.400
I saw about 20 doctors.

08:02.433 --> 08:05.734
Most of them said they don't do
this revision anymore

08:05.767 --> 08:09.734
because you're taking
all the responsibilities
of the bad doctor's work.

08:09.767 --> 08:12.633
They prefer to have--
Are we crazy?
[laughs]

08:12.667 --> 08:14.433
[Nuray]
It's sad.
It's a little late for that.

08:14.467 --> 08:15.734
Very sad.
A little late
to wonder that one.

08:15.767 --> 08:18.000
Are we crazy? Yeah.
I'm crazy.

08:18.033 --> 08:21.033
I'm crazy to take on
these incredibly
impossible operations

08:21.066 --> 08:24.633
on national television
and hang out with Paul
all day long.

08:24.667 --> 08:28.066
For a woman who basically
makes her living from her face,

08:28.100 --> 08:29.567
this must be devastating.

08:29.600 --> 08:31.400
If it was around my body--
Right.

08:31.433 --> 08:33.066
...I could cover up with dress.

08:33.100 --> 08:35.400
But this is something
that I cannot hide.

08:35.433 --> 08:36.600
What are your goals?

08:36.633 --> 08:39.066
I want my eyes
to look equal.

08:39.100 --> 08:41.100
I wanna have flat eyes.

08:41.133 --> 08:43.400
I just wanna look like
the way I looked before.

08:43.433 --> 08:45.500
Let's go to the exam room
and see what's going on.
Okay. Thank you.

08:45.533 --> 08:47.400
[Sarah]
Knowing that there have been

08:47.433 --> 08:49.667
doctors that rejected
her revision

08:49.700 --> 08:51.767
is just-- "Okay, this is gonna
be another one," you know?

08:52.000 --> 08:56.500
Like, if 20 doctors
are gonna reject you,
then why not them?

08:56.533 --> 08:59.667
So I'm very nervous for her.

08:59.700 --> 09:03.433
This is a celebrity singer
right here. T.I. & Tiny?
What?

09:03.467 --> 09:05.233
This is Tiny.
T.I. is a rapper.

09:05.266 --> 09:08.667
Right.
Oh, you know him, huh?

09:08.700 --> 09:10.533
This is a risky procedure.

09:10.567 --> 09:11.700
You can heal like this.

09:11.734 --> 09:13.467
The corners of your eyes
can change.

09:13.500 --> 09:14.567
You might have some loose skin.

09:19.667 --> 09:22.667
♪ I wanna be perfect ♪

09:22.700 --> 09:25.166
[Dr. Nassif]
Okay, let me feel here.

09:26.734 --> 09:28.133
[mutters]

09:28.166 --> 09:29.734
There's a lot of it
over here, right?

09:29.767 --> 09:32.000
Mm-hmm.
All right.

09:32.033 --> 09:34.633
So let's talk about
some thoughts about this.

09:34.667 --> 09:38.767
The issue with the eye is
it's really deeply attached
to the muscle.

09:39.000 --> 09:43.233
Mostly likely,
some of Nuray's fat
is attached to the muscle,

09:43.266 --> 09:45.767
and that's not a good thing,
because if you damage
that muscle,

09:46.000 --> 09:47.767
Nuray's lower eyelids
can pull down,

09:48.000 --> 09:50.567
she might not be able
to blink properly,
or close her eyes.

09:50.600 --> 09:54.333
So, the way to do this
is called the
"transconjunctival approach,"

09:54.367 --> 09:56.266
where you make an incision
in the eye--
[Nuray]
Mm-hmm.

09:56.300 --> 09:59.233
...and try to develop a plane
between the fat and the muscle.

09:59.266 --> 10:02.734
This is a risky procedure.
You can heal like this.

10:02.767 --> 10:05.233
The corners of your eyes
can change a little bit.
That's what I'm scared of.

10:05.266 --> 10:08.233
You might have some loose skin.
There's multiple risks to this,

10:08.266 --> 10:12.700
but the biggest thing of all is,
you're not gonna get back
to where you were.

10:12.734 --> 10:14.333
I don't really think so.

10:14.367 --> 10:18.100
But once you start this route,
it may lead to more surgeries,

10:18.133 --> 10:20.033
may lead to problems.
Yeah.

10:20.066 --> 10:21.533
Do you want to do
the procedure?

10:21.567 --> 10:25.266
Yes. I am willing
to take all the risks,

10:25.300 --> 10:29.000
because I can't--
I don't want to deal
with this anymore.
Yeah.

10:29.033 --> 10:31.600
I don't like it
when I look at the mirror.
[Dr. Dubrow] Yeah.

10:31.633 --> 10:34.600
My biggest regret
is not researching my doctor.

10:34.633 --> 10:38.266
And because of it,
I lost my job as a model.

10:38.300 --> 10:40.600
I should never, ever done this.

10:40.633 --> 10:42.066
Pleasure.
Pleasure meeting you.

10:42.100 --> 10:43.600
Thank you.
Thank you.

10:43.633 --> 10:46.333
My name is Shamra,
I'm from Atlanta, Georgia,

10:46.367 --> 10:49.767
and with these baseball boobs,
I'm striking out.

10:50.000 --> 10:55.133
The left one--
it's heavy, very hard,
and it looks like a baseball.

10:55.166 --> 10:59.533
And on the right,
I have rippling.
It's just ugly.

10:59.567 --> 11:04.233
Before I got pregnant,
my body was very sexy.

11:04.266 --> 11:07.066
My breasts were very perky.

11:07.100 --> 11:12.200
And then,
once I had first daughter
when I was 19,

11:12.233 --> 11:14.033
things went down the drain.

11:14.066 --> 11:17.266
My breasts just went
like bananas.

11:17.300 --> 11:20.066
You know, they drooped really,
and just--

11:20.100 --> 11:21.767
They were just, like, blah.

11:22.000 --> 11:25.400
So, I decided to do
something about it,

11:25.433 --> 11:28.767
and I did find a doctor that
I had heard great things about.

11:29.000 --> 11:32.700
He had an unconventional way
of doing the breast procedure.

11:32.734 --> 11:35.133
What he would do
is go through your naval

11:35.166 --> 11:37.133
and put the implants in
that way.

11:37.166 --> 11:40.133
No scars.
Like, doesn't get
any better than that.

11:40.166 --> 11:43.200
Two months after my surgery,

11:43.233 --> 11:47.433
my left breast was a bit firm.

11:47.467 --> 11:51.100
You know, it wasn't soft
like my right one was.

11:51.133 --> 11:55.200
I went back to my doctor,
and I said,
"Hey, what's going on?"

11:55.233 --> 11:58.166
He told me that it was nothing
for me to worry about.

11:58.200 --> 12:01.066
Over time, it got more firm.

12:01.100 --> 12:05.066
My left breast--
it became a baseball.

12:05.100 --> 12:08.066
I have some rippling.

12:08.100 --> 12:11.066
And it's definitely
stretched out the areola

12:11.100 --> 12:13.000
and made it humongous.

12:13.033 --> 12:17.000
I was gonna have surgery,
but the timing
wasn't right for me,

12:17.033 --> 12:22.000
because my daughter was in
a very successful singing group
called The OMG Girlz,

12:22.033 --> 12:24.667
and I was always
on the road with her.

12:24.700 --> 12:29.633
I had to be there.
I could not, you know,
be down from having surgery.

12:29.667 --> 12:32.033
My daughter's
no longer in the group.

12:32.066 --> 12:34.433
She's actually a solo artist,
and she's at a point

12:34.467 --> 12:38.633
where she has a team,
so I don't have to be
so hands on.

12:38.667 --> 12:40.767
She's like,
"Hey, you know, I'm good.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.700
Get you some surgery.
You gonna be sexy and fly,
girl."

12:43.734 --> 12:45.133
That's what she told me.

12:46.667 --> 12:49.000
We're gonna go in here
and see what they have.

12:49.033 --> 12:52.200
We gotta be cute and fun
and style ready.

12:52.233 --> 12:53.734
[Tameka]
What do you plan
on buying here?

12:53.767 --> 12:55.266
[Shamra]
[indistinct] and cover-ups.

12:55.300 --> 12:57.200
All of these are grandmas...

12:57.233 --> 12:59.233
No, I'm thinking something
like this.

12:59.266 --> 13:02.033
No, we're not doing that.
Oh, my God...

13:02.066 --> 13:03.700
That won't be
on the beach with us.

13:03.734 --> 13:06.300
[Shamra]
I met Tameka
when I was ten years old,

13:06.333 --> 13:09.000
and she was 11.
We were inseparable.

13:09.033 --> 13:11.367
Always together, every day,
day in, day out.

13:11.400 --> 13:14.100
This is a nice one-piece.
[bleep] [exclaims]

13:14.133 --> 13:16.000
It ain't gonna do
much of nothing.

13:16.033 --> 13:17.700
That's what I'm saying.
Girl, now you're trippin'.

13:17.734 --> 13:20.133
No. No, no, no, no.
You can't wear that.

13:20.166 --> 13:22.066
What about this?
This is covered.

13:22.100 --> 13:24.333
[exclaims]
Oh. No.

13:24.367 --> 13:26.100
Too much of my breasts out.
Sorry.

13:26.133 --> 13:27.700
[Tameka]
Oh, Sham, I'm sick of you.
You know what?

13:27.734 --> 13:29.767
I'm not fittin'
to even entertain this.
Okay, so--

13:30.000 --> 13:33.133
Shamra's been there for me
for most of my childhood,

13:33.166 --> 13:34.667
growing up to my teenage years.

13:34.700 --> 13:37.000
I've had a crazy life.

13:37.033 --> 13:39.300
R&B singer from the '90s.

13:39.333 --> 13:41.767
They call me Tiny
'cause I'm 4'11".

13:42.000 --> 13:44.100
Very small.
[laughs]

13:44.133 --> 13:45.200
Okay.

13:45.233 --> 13:47.033
Okay, first and foremost,

13:47.066 --> 13:49.233
we have this big ball here.

13:49.266 --> 13:51.200
Baseball titties.
[laughter]

13:51.233 --> 13:55.033
I would love to see Shamra
in a two-piece--

13:55.066 --> 13:57.100
the skimpiest of the skimpiest.

13:57.133 --> 14:01.266
[Shamra]
Maybe after the appointment
with Dr. Dubrow and Dr. Nassif,

14:01.300 --> 14:04.000
then we can come back,
and then I can try on
all the two-pieces.

14:04.033 --> 14:07.000
With her, you know,
feeling crazy about her body

14:07.033 --> 14:10.367
and having all these complaints,
I'm ready for her
to do something about it.

14:10.400 --> 14:12.333
One-pieces typically work
for me.

14:12.367 --> 14:15.233
But, as you guys
can see here again,
it's cut too low,

14:15.266 --> 14:17.200
so you see the bulging here.

14:17.233 --> 14:20.100
Looking at myself
in these bathing suits--
it just really lets me know

14:20.133 --> 14:22.166
that I really, really
have to get this fixed.

14:22.200 --> 14:24.333
All the new bathing suits
you tried on,
you're not getting nothing?

14:24.367 --> 14:27.367
Have a great day.
[Tameka] That lady
probably think we crazy.

14:27.400 --> 14:32.367
We've been in here
for a whole hour, and you
tried on five bathing suits!

14:32.400 --> 14:34.533
She wants to take
the pixie theme,

14:34.567 --> 14:38.166
but then maybe have it
transition to, like,
some type of a fox

14:38.200 --> 14:40.166
and become her superhero.
[imitates claw sound]

14:40.200 --> 14:43.266
This is very exciting.
[laughs]

14:43.300 --> 14:46.567
That's what can make a problem
keeping the nipple alive.

14:46.600 --> 14:50.133
What? Like...
Like not falling off
because it died.

14:50.166 --> 14:53.133
He could be sucking
on this thing, and boom,
a nipple's in his mouth?

14:53.166 --> 14:55.000
No!
[laughing]
No, no, no, no...

14:58.100 --> 15:00.166
♪ I wanna be perfect ♪

15:05.300 --> 15:07.266
Hi there, guys.

15:07.300 --> 15:09.033
[man]
Hello.
Hi.
Hi.

15:09.066 --> 15:11.200
[Pixee]
Thank you for coming.

15:11.233 --> 15:13.500
Today I have invited
three cartoonists

15:13.533 --> 15:17.133
who's gonna help me
put Pixee Fox on paper.

15:17.166 --> 15:21.133
Her name is Pixee Fox.
So, she wants to take
the pixie theme

15:21.166 --> 15:23.333
and make that really strong,
like a superhero,

15:23.367 --> 15:26.533
but then maybe have it
transition to, like,
some type of a fox

15:26.567 --> 15:28.567
and become her superhero.
[imitates claw sound]

15:28.600 --> 15:31.600
[Pixee laughs]
And then maybe the wings can
expand, and she can fly away.

15:31.633 --> 15:35.533
[Pixee]
I have this idea of making
my own cartoon book

15:35.567 --> 15:37.633
after my
plastic surgery's done.

15:37.667 --> 15:40.166
So this is--
For me, it's very exciting.

15:40.200 --> 15:42.166
So I'm thinking you might wanna
do something with your hands.

15:42.200 --> 15:45.400
Kind of like, you know,
giving off lightning bolts,
stuff like that. Yeah.

15:45.433 --> 15:49.133
[laughs] Everything needs
to come together
a little bit at once

15:49.166 --> 15:51.233
until we have the character.
Mm-hmm.

15:51.266 --> 15:53.133
Right.
[Steve]
The character complete.
Exactly.

15:53.166 --> 15:55.567
Pixee's so close
to completing her vision.

15:55.600 --> 16:00.133
I would call Pixee
a living, breathing,
walking, talking work of art.

16:00.166 --> 16:03.266
I love everything
that has to do
with fantasy,

16:03.300 --> 16:06.433
'cause I just find it so boring
to live in, like,

16:06.467 --> 16:09.600
a normal world,
and everything is the same.

16:09.633 --> 16:13.200
Yeah, I like how you kind of
brought your hip out.
It looks really nice.

16:13.233 --> 16:16.200
For me, this is a huge moment,

16:16.233 --> 16:20.233
because it just represents
how far I have come

16:20.266 --> 16:23.600
from being an electrician
in Sweden
to being in America.

16:23.633 --> 16:26.266
And soon,
I'll have my own cartoon.

16:26.300 --> 16:29.600
[gasps]
Oh, my gosh!

16:29.633 --> 16:32.400
Walking down
to meet your audience.
[Pixee] That is amazing.

16:32.433 --> 16:34.600
[gasps]
Oh, wow!

16:34.633 --> 16:37.133
Oh, my God!

16:37.166 --> 16:39.467
All of you.
[gasps]
[Steve]
Those are incredible.

16:39.500 --> 16:42.633
[Pixee]
Oh, my God. I love the tail
and the, uh-- the wings there.

16:42.667 --> 16:44.633
That is me.
[laughing]

16:44.667 --> 16:48.367
Now I'm panicking
to get my procedure done

16:48.400 --> 16:51.433
so I can move on with my own
cartoon book coming up.

16:51.467 --> 16:54.100
This is gonna give us
a lot to work with.
Oh, yes.

16:54.133 --> 16:56.233
Thank you so much.
You're very nice.
And the big one.

16:56.266 --> 16:57.667
You're amazing artists.

16:57.700 --> 17:00.633
The only two artists
that is left to see now

17:00.667 --> 17:03.367
is Dr. Nassif and Dr. Dubrow.

17:03.400 --> 17:04.633
Here I come.

17:04.667 --> 17:06.500
Thank you so much.
Thanks, guys.

17:06.533 --> 17:07.667
Thank you.

17:14.233 --> 17:18.700
So we actually have
an interesting patient
who has a breast problem.

17:18.734 --> 17:23.133
And what's interesting is
she doesn't have any scars
on her breasts.

17:23.166 --> 17:24.500
Let me show you this.
Oh!

17:24.533 --> 17:26.633
Look how large
her areolas are.
I know.

17:26.667 --> 17:28.700
So why don't you
bring Shamra in?
Let's see what she wants.

17:28.734 --> 17:30.433
Can you please send in Shamra?

17:31.667 --> 17:33.533
Shamra.
Hi! Shamra.

17:33.567 --> 17:36.133
Oh, you got a bunch
of folks here.
Terry Dubrow. Nice to meet you.

17:36.166 --> 17:39.266
Nice to meet you.
Tameka, Shamra-- Tameka--

17:39.300 --> 17:41.467
[Tameka]
I'm definitely here
to support Shamra.

17:41.500 --> 17:44.200
I'm excited about
these breasts getting fixed.

17:44.233 --> 17:46.166
They look terrible.

17:46.200 --> 17:48.266
By the way,
don't you know who that is?
[women chattering]

17:48.300 --> 17:49.667
I don't know anything about--

17:49.700 --> 17:51.467
What is it? Pop culture?
Is that what you call it?

17:51.500 --> 17:54.133
That's what we call it. Yes.
[laughing]

17:54.166 --> 17:57.433
What? You are?
I'm an R&B singer from the '90s.

17:57.467 --> 17:59.533
Wait a minute--
Xscape. T.I. & Tiny?

17:59.567 --> 18:00.700
What?
This is Tiny.

18:00.734 --> 18:02.633
Well, T.I. is a rapper.
Right.

18:02.667 --> 18:05.300
Yeah.
Oh, you know him, huh?

18:05.333 --> 18:07.633
So, you're a singer
from the '90s,
but you're, like, too young

18:07.667 --> 18:09.433
to be a singer from the '90s.
I wish.

18:09.467 --> 18:11.467
You must be
somebody's daughter.

18:11.500 --> 18:13.567
Yeah, I'm her daughter.
And you guys are friends.

18:13.600 --> 18:15.734
Yes. This is my bestie sister.
Yeah.

18:15.767 --> 18:17.700
[Dr. Dubrow]
Is that right?
So you guys--
Yeah.

18:17.734 --> 18:20.333
You're very familiar
with your situation, right?

18:20.367 --> 18:24.166
I really thought her--
her surgery came out great
at the time.

18:24.200 --> 18:25.700
But-- I don't know.
Something happened.

18:25.734 --> 18:27.567
I don't know what happened
af-- after.

18:27.600 --> 18:29.767
She was, like,
getting hard.

18:30.000 --> 18:33.400
I wanna hear how this happened,
'cause I don't see any scars
on your breasts.

18:33.433 --> 18:36.000
The reason is because
I had a tummy tuck

18:36.033 --> 18:38.233
and the breasts
at the same time.

18:38.266 --> 18:40.367
Trans-tummy tuck.
Oh, trans-- Oh.

18:40.400 --> 18:42.734
So, I was just already open,
and they just went there.
Oh.

18:42.767 --> 18:46.467
[Dr. Dubrow] Placing implants
through a tummy tuck incision
is very difficult,

18:46.500 --> 18:50.767
offers very poor visualization
of the operative field,

18:51.000 --> 18:53.467
and is not really ever
a good idea.

18:53.500 --> 18:57.600
And within the last year
and a half, this thing
has gotten so hard

18:57.633 --> 19:00.533
it looks like a baseball,
it feels like a baseball.

19:00.567 --> 19:02.033
It's a baseball.

19:02.066 --> 19:04.367
[Dr. Dubrow]
The reason why

19:04.400 --> 19:08.533
this is a high-risk case
is thin skin

19:08.567 --> 19:11.500
and soft tissue
with little blood vessels

19:11.533 --> 19:15.300
that aren't bringing in
a lot of oxygen
to the nipple and areola.

19:15.333 --> 19:18.600
You start cutting around there,
it cuts off the oxygen.

19:18.633 --> 19:20.633
That's what can make
a problem

19:20.667 --> 19:24.533
for scar formation
and even keeping
the nipple alive.

19:24.567 --> 19:27.633
What? Like, alive,
as in feeling good?
Like-- Like--

19:27.667 --> 19:30.000
No. Alive, as in, like--
Like living.

19:30.033 --> 19:33.467
Like living.
Like not turning black

19:33.500 --> 19:36.533
and falling off,
like, dropping off.
You have got to be kidding me.

19:36.567 --> 19:38.433
I kid you not.
I would be dead, too,

19:38.467 --> 19:39.767
if that was to happen.
[Dr. Dubrow]
Right?

19:40.000 --> 19:42.233
So that happens?
That happens.

19:42.266 --> 19:45.767
Believe me,
we have had people
tell stories about

19:46.000 --> 19:49.500
how they had
these exact procedures,
and they were in the shower,

19:49.533 --> 19:51.700
and they looked down
at their nipples
going down the drain.

19:51.734 --> 19:54.266
I would die.
Yep.

19:54.300 --> 19:56.633
Let's just say, you know,
later on down the line,

19:56.667 --> 19:59.467
I meet, you know,
a better half,

19:59.500 --> 20:02.467
and he could be sucking
on this thing, and boom,
a nipple's in his mouth?

20:02.500 --> 20:05.066
No!
[laughing]
No, no, no, no. Oh, God.

20:05.100 --> 20:07.000
[women laughing]
Could you imagine that?

20:07.033 --> 20:08.400
"What is this?"

20:08.433 --> 20:11.400
Ew! Thankfully,
that's not possible.

20:11.433 --> 20:15.100
I won't know the risk analysis
till we go in the exam room

20:15.133 --> 20:18.100
and really feel how thick
the skin is and the soft tissue.

20:18.133 --> 20:20.533
[Tameka]
I'm hoping Dr. Dubrow
can turn her breasts

20:20.567 --> 20:24.433
into soft, perky boobs,
and she's able
to just be comfortable.

20:24.467 --> 20:29.500
She needs to enjoy life,
so I'm thinking that these
breasts will do it for her.

20:29.533 --> 20:32.667
First of all, I wanna look
at the overall position
of the breast mound.

20:32.700 --> 20:35.266
So, this is
the encapsulated one.

20:35.300 --> 20:38.300
And this one
is not encapsulated.

20:38.333 --> 20:40.367
So you can see
there's much more rippling

20:40.400 --> 20:44.367
on the side that doesn't
have the encapsulation
than the one that does.

20:44.400 --> 20:47.367
Rippling
after breast augmentation
is where you can see

20:47.400 --> 20:50.700
the fluid wave
within the breast implant.

20:50.734 --> 20:56.000
And that's usually due to
a lack of soft tissue thickness
overlying the implant.

20:56.033 --> 20:59.033
So, number one:
how do you get rid
of the rippling?

20:59.066 --> 21:00.500
You put them
under the muscle.

21:00.533 --> 21:03.667
Number two: you have
encapsulation scar tissue,

21:03.700 --> 21:07.533
so you have to make incisions
in the capsule
to get it to soften up.

21:07.567 --> 21:12.433
In addition, you need
reduction of the areolas
and removal of skin

21:12.467 --> 21:16.033
so that you can tighten up
the breast envelope
and get it lifted.

21:16.066 --> 21:18.433
The full lift is the problem.

21:18.467 --> 21:23.033
Cutting off the blood supply
and the possibility
of losing sensation

21:23.066 --> 21:25.600
and maybe, ultimately,
worst-case scenario--

21:25.633 --> 21:27.633
The nipple.
The nipple's fallen off.

21:27.667 --> 21:31.467
Now, have I ever lost
a nipple in my career? No.

21:31.500 --> 21:35.000
So you never lost a nipple
in your career, Doc?
I'mma hold you to that.

21:35.033 --> 21:37.633
We put nitro paste to make
the blood vessels bigger.

21:37.667 --> 21:41.066
We put you in
a hyperbaric oxygen chamber.
We put leeches on.

21:42.500 --> 21:45.467
So if you're in, I'm in.

21:48.066 --> 21:49.734
We're in.
All right.

21:49.767 --> 21:51.600
It's great to meet you.
Thank you.

21:51.633 --> 21:53.567
I'm just gonna be,
inside my brain,

21:53.600 --> 21:56.367
"Hey, nipple, stay attached.
We're gonna do this.
Stay alive."

21:56.400 --> 21:59.600
New titties it is.
Can't wait to see 'em.

21:59.633 --> 22:02.467
[both]
Me either.

22:02.500 --> 22:04.333
[Dr. Nassif]
That's stuck to the muscle.

22:04.367 --> 22:05.734
[Dr. Massry]
So that's the question:
do we or don't we?

22:05.767 --> 22:07.600
[Dr. Nassif] All kinds
of things could happen

22:07.633 --> 22:10.100
if we injure that eye muscle.

22:10.133 --> 22:13.000
I went to have
an eyelash transplant.

22:13.033 --> 22:14.700
I took it from-- from here.
[laughing]
Pubic area.

22:14.734 --> 22:18.000
Pubic hair eyelash transplant.
Do you still have to curl 'em?

22:21.066 --> 22:23.133
♪ I wanna be perfect ♪

22:27.633 --> 22:29.266
Miss Nuray, how are you?

22:29.300 --> 22:31.000
Great, thank you.
How are you?

22:31.033 --> 22:34.066
This young man
is Dr. Guy Massry.

22:34.100 --> 22:36.533
Dr. Massry's
an oculoplastic surgeon,

22:36.567 --> 22:39.200
and he's been a friend of mine
for over 30 years.

22:39.233 --> 22:43.734
And the two of us combined
are gonna have
the best outcome possible.

22:43.767 --> 22:48.166
This is something that
both of us have been doing--
God-- since about 1999.

22:48.200 --> 22:51.166
Do you have any questions?
No. Thank you.

22:51.200 --> 22:55.300
I've been thinking about this,
talking about this
every single day,

22:55.333 --> 23:00.633
and I have hope that Dr. Nassif
is gonna end
this struggle for me.

23:00.667 --> 23:02.734
Let me ask you this.
You know, we're
taking out this fat,

23:02.767 --> 23:05.066
which, you know, may be stuck
to the muscle.
[Dr. Massry] Right.

23:05.100 --> 23:08.166
We have to leave that fat alone
because we don't want
to injure the muscle.

23:08.200 --> 23:10.500
You debulk it down.
The problem is that because

23:10.533 --> 23:13.600
this fat is from the abdomen,
as she gains weight
when she gets older,

23:13.633 --> 23:15.500
whatever we leave behind
can grow again.

23:20.500 --> 23:23.033
[Dr. Nassif]
For Nuray's surgery, we'll
start by making an incision

23:23.066 --> 23:26.033
inside the eyelids
and identify the grafted fat.

23:26.066 --> 23:29.266
Then we'll dissect it
from the muscle
or natural tissue.

23:29.300 --> 23:32.700
Next, we'll nail the corner
of the eyelids by performing
a tarsorrhaphy,

23:32.734 --> 23:35.500
partially sewing the upper
and lower lids together.

23:35.533 --> 23:39.166
Hopefully, this'll bring
Nuray as close to her
pre-surgery look as possible.

23:39.200 --> 23:41.333
So we're gonna start out
by making an incision

23:41.367 --> 23:45.233
not on the external surface
of the eyelid skin, but inside.

23:45.266 --> 23:48.767
So this is the fat
that was grafted
from the previous doctor,

23:49.000 --> 23:51.767
and this is the fat
that lives inside the eye.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.100
This is called the central,
and this is called
the medial fat.

23:54.133 --> 23:57.300
And this is a little muscle
called the inferior oblique
right here,

23:57.333 --> 23:59.600
and obviously we have to
stay away from that.

23:59.633 --> 24:01.633
Seeing a difference
between native fat--

24:01.667 --> 24:03.533
fat she was born with--
because it's softer,

24:03.567 --> 24:06.266
versus grafted fat,
which is more firm,

24:06.300 --> 24:08.767
it makes it a little bit easier
for us to get into
that dissection,

24:09.000 --> 24:12.333
make sure we're removing
the right fat,
which is the grafted fat.

24:12.367 --> 24:14.633
All right. So that was it.

24:14.667 --> 24:17.133
[Dr. Massry]
The other place the fat could be
is in the muscles.

24:17.166 --> 24:19.300
[Dr. Nassif]
Well, there is.
It's stuck to the muscle.

24:19.333 --> 24:22.300
So that's the question:
do we or don't we?
You know what? Uh-uh.

24:22.333 --> 24:25.133
Okay.
I would not touch it. We don't
wanna injure that muscle at all.

24:25.166 --> 24:28.633
With Nuray, there is
a good amount of fat
that is adherent to the muscle.

24:28.667 --> 24:31.734
The muscle-- a vital
structure to the lower eyelid.

24:31.767 --> 24:36.667
All kinds of things
could happen adversely
if we injure that eye muscle.

24:36.700 --> 24:40.266
All right. So, basically,
the bottom line is she's
gonna have some residual fat,

24:40.300 --> 24:42.367
but it's 75%, 80% better.

24:42.400 --> 24:45.333
It's just too risky.
Now we're starting
this other eye.

24:45.367 --> 24:49.300
Getting into Nuray's right eye
is a lot more difficult
than I anticipated,

24:49.333 --> 24:53.300
because as we were dissecting
through the tissue, the fat
has created some scar tissue,

24:53.333 --> 24:55.166
and it's like a rock
going through here.

24:55.200 --> 24:58.300
So, at this point,
we've done a nice job

24:58.333 --> 25:01.400
removing as much
as we feel safely

25:01.433 --> 25:04.233
without hopefully causing
any muscle injury.

25:04.266 --> 25:07.300
That thing is so much better.
Feel it now, Paul.
[woman] So much better.

25:07.333 --> 25:11.033
Overall, we see about
a 75% to 85% improvement.

25:11.066 --> 25:13.367
So, great job. Let's go.
[Dr. Massry]
All right.

25:19.100 --> 25:22.000
[Dr. Nassif]
Remember someone we saw
in the past, Pixee Fox?

25:22.033 --> 25:24.600
Yes.
Remember, she's the one
who came in-- ribs removed.

25:24.633 --> 25:28.066
And I think she wanted her butt
made bigger, and it was
already perfect as it was.

25:28.100 --> 25:31.300
Well, apparently she's here
to see us. Let's take
a look at her photos.

25:31.333 --> 25:33.200
Her breasts look bigger.
Yeah.

25:33.233 --> 25:35.166
Who's that? That's her?
That's her too.

25:35.200 --> 25:37.033
[Dr. Dubrow]
She doesn't look real.

25:37.066 --> 25:38.333
Can you please send in Pixee?

25:40.300 --> 25:43.000
Hello, there.
Hello, Miss Pixee.
Wow.

25:43.033 --> 25:45.367
Hey, you two
haven't changed a bit.

25:45.400 --> 25:48.734
I am proud
over what I have achieved.

25:48.767 --> 25:52.200
I think it's amazing.
I have new face, new body.

25:52.233 --> 25:53.300
It's a lot.

25:53.333 --> 25:55.266
Can you start from when
you left us?

25:55.300 --> 25:56.734
Okay.
What's been happening?

25:56.767 --> 25:59.200
I actually brought a list,
if it's...

25:59.233 --> 26:01.333
Since you left,
you have a list?
Yeah.

26:01.367 --> 26:04.600
Wow.
I have invented
some [bleep] here. It's deep.

26:04.633 --> 26:06.600
Are you ready?
It's deep?

26:06.633 --> 26:11.033
Yeah. First of all,
I went straight to have
an eyelash transplant.

26:11.066 --> 26:13.033
All right.
But it's, uh,

26:13.066 --> 26:16.200
not a hair transplant
like other hair transplants.

26:16.233 --> 26:18.100
It's, um--
I took it from--

26:18.133 --> 26:19.200
Pubic area.
...from here.

26:19.233 --> 26:20.734
You did?

26:21.000 --> 26:23.700
Because I have no hair,
like, in those places.

26:23.734 --> 26:26.233
And this is--
You know, it's not dark.

26:26.266 --> 26:28.000
You took pubic hair
for eyelash transplant.

26:28.033 --> 26:29.433
I'm the only one
in the world who done it.

26:29.467 --> 26:31.066
To ever do that?
Yes.

26:31.100 --> 26:33.300
Pubic hair eyelash transplant.

26:33.333 --> 26:36.033
That's a new one.
Do you still have to curl 'em?

26:36.066 --> 26:38.033
Oh, I got abdominal etching.
Etching?

26:38.066 --> 26:39.133
Yes. The etching.

26:39.166 --> 26:41.433
And then I went to Iran

26:41.467 --> 26:44.033
to get this, like, fairy nose
you see right now.

26:44.066 --> 26:45.233
It's very pointy.

26:45.266 --> 26:48.333
One month after that,
I went to Chicago.

26:48.367 --> 26:51.133
I got elf ears.
So he reduced my ears.

26:51.166 --> 26:52.400
So you can see
they're quite pointy.

26:52.433 --> 26:55.367
I wanna look like
a cartoon pixie character.

26:55.400 --> 26:58.367
Yeah?
So, pointy nose, pointy ears...

26:58.400 --> 27:02.100
What else?
Okay. Let me see.
Where am I on the list?

27:02.133 --> 27:06.033
Oh. Right.
[laughing]

27:06.066 --> 27:07.734
You're laughing at the next one.
Yes.

27:07.767 --> 27:11.100

27:14.734 --> 27:17.000
I don't know what they call it
because it's like--

27:17.033 --> 27:19.300
it's making it look,
you know--

27:19.333 --> 27:21.333
I'm gonna
use the word "baby flower."

like a baby flower.

27:23.767 --> 27:25.667
Sharing is caring.
Thank you.

27:25.700 --> 27:27.266
The reason why I look
the way I do--

27:27.300 --> 27:31.066
I can barely talk right now.
Because I went to Korea.

27:31.100 --> 27:33.300
I had, uh, facial bone surgery.

27:33.333 --> 27:35.433
So they reduced the cheekbones.

27:35.467 --> 27:38.467
They cut the whole upper jaw,
repositioned it.

27:38.500 --> 27:42.333
And then they cut my chin,
took a piece out,
repositioned it.

27:42.367 --> 27:45.233
Yeah. I noticed
that you have no--
It's a straight line now.

27:45.266 --> 27:47.266
Mm-hmm.
It's called a "V-line surgery."

27:47.300 --> 27:50.700
The V-line jaw-reduction surgery
can be very dangerous

27:50.734 --> 27:54.033
because it
can cause permanent damage
to the two nerves

27:54.066 --> 27:56.400
that come off her mandible
right here and here.

27:56.433 --> 27:59.166
Why are you here?
I had two brow lifts.

27:59.200 --> 28:02.133
But that highered
my hairline a little bit,

28:02.166 --> 28:05.233
so I'm thinking about
lowering it a bit.

28:05.266 --> 28:07.033
Lower your hairline.
Yes.

28:07.066 --> 28:09.533
I think Dr. Dubrow and I would
obviously wanna examine you.

28:09.567 --> 28:11.433
Especially, we wanna really
look at this area.

28:11.467 --> 28:13.033

Also your forehead.

28:13.066 --> 28:14.367
All right.

28:14.400 --> 28:17.500
I am so close

28:17.533 --> 28:20.133
to becoming a real-life cartoon.

28:20.166 --> 28:22.433

I can't do that.
Your [indistinct] is out.

29:25.200 --> 29:28.066
Already we've determined
that these two sensory nerves

29:28.100 --> 29:33.300
that come out of your jaw
and supply your entire lower jaw
with sensation are out.

29:33.333 --> 29:37.433
In addition, the motor nerve
that controls your lip

Right now, your forehead matches
the middle part of your face,
and it's beautiful.

30:22.667 --> 30:25.333
Changing your hairline
will ruin your look.

30:25.367 --> 30:29.400
If you make an incision,
and you have a cut here
and a cut here,

30:29.433 --> 30:31.533
the hair in between
doesn't get good blood supply.

30:31.567 --> 30:33.233
Do you know what happens
to the hair in between?

30:33.266 --> 30:34.667
Dies. Falls off.
It dies.

30:34.700 --> 30:37.233
You don't want that to happen.
This is why you do just...

30:37.266 --> 30:39.100
No, but that won't do anything.

30:39.133 --> 30:41.633
At least the deal
you should make with yourself

30:41.667 --> 30:43.734
is that until
everything comes back,
and you figure out

30:43.767 --> 30:45.667
whether you've had a really
significant complication,

30:45.700 --> 30:48.166
you should stop everything
for now and wait

30:48.200 --> 30:50.300
to see what happens
with these nerves.
I have stopped.

30:50.333 --> 30:52.467
[Dr. Dubrow] Good.
I haven't had plastic surgery
for two weeks.

30:52.500 --> 30:55.166
So how about th--
Terrific.

30:55.200 --> 30:57.100
[Pixee]
Nothing changed, really.

30:57.133 --> 31:00.100
They're still telling me
not to do things...

31:00.133 --> 31:02.100
that I'm gonna go ahead
and do anyway.

31:02.133 --> 31:04.133
It was nice seeing you again.
Nice seeing you.

31:04.166 --> 31:06.233
Mm-wah-wah-wah.
Mm...
Mwah.

31:06.266 --> 31:08.100
Mwah. Heh.
You don't want--

31:08.133 --> 31:09.700
[muttering]
He doesn't get that.
Just me.

31:09.734 --> 31:10.700
[Dr. Nassif]
Bye-bye.
Bye.

31:10.734 --> 31:12.433
Bye-bye. See you.

31:17.600 --> 31:19.333
[Dr. Dubrow]
Shamra.
[Shamra]
Hi!

31:19.367 --> 31:21.200
How are you?
Good. How are you?

31:21.233 --> 31:23.533
I'm great.
Good to see you.
Same here.

31:23.567 --> 31:24.633
You're excited.
Yeah.

31:24.667 --> 31:27.133
Okay, so, every time

31:27.166 --> 31:29.567
I make an incision
in your breast soft tissue

31:29.600 --> 31:33.300
and remove it to lift it up,
I'm removing blood supply.

31:33.333 --> 31:36.500
So the big concern, for sure,
is that I take just enough

31:36.533 --> 31:39.266
so it's up and looking nice
but not too much

31:39.300 --> 31:42.734
that I've choked off
the blood supply and the oxygen
to the nipple and it dies.

31:42.767 --> 31:45.200
Right. Which means
the nipple falls off.

31:45.233 --> 31:46.533
Which means
the nipple falls off.

31:46.567 --> 31:48.734
Which is not cool.
At all.

31:53.600 --> 31:56.300
[Dr. Dubrow]
For Shamra's surgery, I will
begin by making an incision

31:56.333 --> 31:59.000
below her areolas
and removing her old implants.

31:59.033 --> 32:03.433
I will then elevate
her pectoralis major muscle
to create new breast pockets,

32:03.467 --> 32:08.233
and then perform a capsulotomy
on the left breast
to soften the scar tissue.

32:08.266 --> 32:10.734
Finally, I will insert
a new pair of breast implants

32:10.767 --> 32:14.400
before performing
a breast lift
and areolar reduction.

32:14.433 --> 32:16.533
This is the most painful part
of the operation--

32:16.567 --> 32:19.000
lifting up
the pectoralis major muscle--

32:19.033 --> 32:20.667
so I'm gonna inject
some numbing medicine in.

32:20.700 --> 32:23.700
This is one of the trickiest
operations in plastic surgery--

32:23.734 --> 32:26.500
is to go from
on top of the muscle
to under the muscle.

32:26.533 --> 32:29.467
So the trick is
to get it under the muscle

32:29.500 --> 32:32.433
so that it looks
like it belongs there.

32:32.467 --> 32:35.433
The muscle is now
still a flat structure.

32:35.467 --> 32:40.500
So it's hard to line
a curved structure
with a flat structure

32:40.533 --> 32:42.533
and not have it be distorted.

32:42.567 --> 32:45.000
That would work, huh?
[woman]
Nice.

32:45.033 --> 32:47.700
[Dr. Dubrow]
So now it's time to work
on the encapsulated side.

32:47.734 --> 32:51.333
This is the real trick
of this operation
because this is the side

32:51.367 --> 32:53.600
where the breast tissue's
been completely changed

32:53.633 --> 32:55.667
by the scar tissue
around the implant.

32:55.700 --> 32:58.467
Oh, yeah.
Look at this capsule.
I'm really squeezing down.

32:58.500 --> 33:01.333
My gosh. Look at this.
It's crack--
[man]
That's why the skin is so thin.

33:01.367 --> 33:04.266
Look at that. Ew!

33:04.300 --> 33:07.433
I swear, I thought
I'd seen everything.

33:07.467 --> 33:10.467
Look at that.
What is this? What is that?

33:10.500 --> 33:13.200
This is the weirdest thing
I've ever seen.

33:13.233 --> 33:16.567
I've never seen this before
in a cosmetic breast case.

33:16.600 --> 33:18.467
Even the most complicated ones.

33:18.500 --> 33:21.734
This is the weirdest thing
I've ever seen.

33:21.767 --> 33:24.400
What is this coming out
of the breast?

33:24.433 --> 33:27.500
What is this stuff?

33:27.533 --> 33:29.500
[woman]
It feels like putty.

33:29.533 --> 33:32.066
It's like--
It's like a moldable putty,
like.

33:32.100 --> 33:35.633
[Dr. Dubrow]
I never anticipated
finding this type of material

33:35.667 --> 33:37.500
inside of Shamra's left breast.

33:37.533 --> 33:40.567
That basically means the body's
formed a very dramatic

33:40.600 --> 33:44.233
inflammatory response
to her breast implants.

33:44.266 --> 33:48.500
It could be related to the fact
that they were placed
in through the abdomen,

33:48.533 --> 33:53.000
because bacteria
or other foreign substances
from the abdomen

33:53.033 --> 33:55.533
could've been tracked
into the breast pocket

33:55.567 --> 33:57.266
where they absolutely
don't belong.

33:57.300 --> 33:59.400
The muscle under here
looks okay.

33:59.433 --> 34:04.367
The only thing we can do
to make this work
is to do a capsulectomy.

34:04.400 --> 34:05.667
[woman]
That's really thin right there.

34:05.700 --> 34:08.000
This is a very [bleep]
dangerous case.

34:08.033 --> 34:09.533
Okay, come out.

34:09.567 --> 34:11.533
My original plan
for Shamra's surgery

34:11.567 --> 34:14.567
was to perform a capsulotomy
to just open up

34:14.600 --> 34:17.333
and release the scar tissue
in the breast.

34:17.367 --> 34:19.767
But because of all these
eggshell-type material,

34:20.000 --> 34:22.667
I now have to remove
the entire capsule.

34:22.700 --> 34:27.700
That's a much larger procedure
and makes this operation
much more complicated.

34:27.734 --> 34:30.333
Part of the problem is
I don't see really good
blood supply.

34:30.367 --> 34:32.700
I know. That's why
I was asking.
Nothing's bleeding.

34:32.734 --> 34:34.266
I know.

34:34.300 --> 34:36.033
She had a 375 saline.

34:36.066 --> 34:38.066
We're gonna put
a 350 silicone

34:38.100 --> 34:40.000
because it's roughly
the same size.

34:40.033 --> 34:42.433
I'd like to do as little
a lift as possible.

34:42.467 --> 34:45.567
The big question mark
for Shamra's breasts is,

34:45.600 --> 34:47.567
does she have
enough blood supply

34:47.600 --> 34:50.500
to support
a breast-lifting procedure?

34:50.533 --> 34:53.066
So I'm gonna proceed slowly

34:53.100 --> 34:56.667
until her tissue signals
to me to stop,

34:56.700 --> 34:59.133
and we've gotta go
to an alternative plan.

34:59.166 --> 35:01.533
Okay, so, I'm a little worried
about this left nipple,

35:01.567 --> 35:04.600
because even though
we got a nice lift,

35:04.633 --> 35:06.467
and we put the implants
under the muscle,

35:06.500 --> 35:08.633
the big question is:
is that left nipple alive?

35:08.667 --> 35:11.433
Can I have a needle?
Let's poke it and see
what happens.

35:11.467 --> 35:13.333
If it bleeds, it's alive.

35:15.600 --> 35:18.500
Okay, here we go.

35:18.533 --> 35:20.567
Come on, baby, bleed.

35:21.633 --> 35:23.100
Ah. Ah.

35:23.133 --> 35:25.000
Oh. I see it. Yeah.
[chuckling]

35:25.033 --> 35:28.100
Blood means oxygen,
and oxygen means life.

35:28.133 --> 35:30.700
This nipple is alive.
Hallelujah.

35:30.734 --> 35:35.600
If these nipples stay alive,
this could be a home run.

35:39.700 --> 35:41.333
Hello.
Hello.

35:41.367 --> 35:42.333
How are you?
Miss Nuray.

35:42.367 --> 35:43.400
Good. How are you?

35:43.433 --> 35:44.734
How ya doin'?
I feel great.

35:44.767 --> 35:48.000
Obviously now
you're very swollen.
Yeah.

35:48.033 --> 35:49.633
Keep icing your eyes.
Mm-hmm.

35:49.667 --> 35:51.600
Are you using the eye drops?
Mm-hmm.

35:51.633 --> 35:53.367
I do have concern,

35:53.400 --> 35:56.100
because there was a lot
of swelling around my eyes.

35:56.133 --> 35:59.000
I couldn't open my eyes.
But I'm hoping

35:59.033 --> 36:01.667
it will heal by itself,

36:01.700 --> 36:04.333
and I can get back
to my modeling job

36:04.367 --> 36:07.033
and past this-- all this
bad experience.

36:07.066 --> 36:10.533
She had fat that was injected
in her lower eyelids.
Yeah.

36:10.567 --> 36:14.633
We were able to expose the fat
and remove a lot of it.

36:14.667 --> 36:16.567
But I saw about
a good 85% improvement.

36:16.600 --> 36:20.100
And how's your vision?
My vision's great.
I have no problem.

36:20.133 --> 36:22.633
Tell me if you only see
one finger.

36:22.667 --> 36:25.367
Only one finger. Yes.
[Dr. Dubrow]
Good.

36:25.400 --> 36:28.367
So, and one of the things, too,
there was a little muscle--
Yeah.

36:28.400 --> 36:31.433
...that lies in between
your fat pads.

36:31.467 --> 36:33.166
Mm-hmm.
We wanted to make sure
we didn't injure that.

36:33.200 --> 36:34.734
Because if we injure that--
You'd see double.

36:34.767 --> 36:36.734
...you would see two
of my fingers instead of one.

36:36.767 --> 36:39.033
One's bad enough.
You'd see two of him.

36:39.066 --> 36:41.033
[laughs]
Do you know what I mean?

36:41.066 --> 36:44.000
She's not gonna agree with you.
Well, she is now.
She's post-op.

36:44.033 --> 36:47.500
No, she's not, because
she thinks I'm fantastic,
you know?

36:47.533 --> 36:50.667
Uh, we'll see you in two weeks.
Right? You think
I'm fantastic, right?

36:50.700 --> 36:53.133
I feel amazing.
She didn't answer the question.

36:53.166 --> 36:55.000
She didn't admit that.
She didn't answer the question.

36:55.033 --> 36:57.533
I don't see the result
right now, but I know
that I know.

36:57.567 --> 36:59.567
So she's still not
gonna say anything.
I don't blame her.

36:59.600 --> 37:02.500
You're not gonna say--
She has a-- She has
a good feeling about it.

37:02.533 --> 37:06.200
She's cautiously optimistic.
[laughing]
[laughing]

37:06.233 --> 37:09.166
Anyway, you look great.
Thank you so much.

37:09.200 --> 37:11.133
The swelling's gonna take
a few weeks.
Okay.

37:11.166 --> 37:12.567
Thank you so much.
[Dr. Dubrow]
Sure.

37:16.700 --> 37:20.533
[Nuray] What happened to me
last year in Turkey
was a big tragedy.

37:20.567 --> 37:24.400
I was feeling very down,
trying to find
all these doctors

37:24.433 --> 37:26.133
to fix this problem.

37:26.166 --> 37:28.000
And I'm just happy.
I'm relieved.

37:28.033 --> 37:29.667
Like, it's not there anymore.

37:29.700 --> 37:31.700
I'm excited to see my friends

37:31.734 --> 37:34.600
because they will see me
happy and smiling

37:34.633 --> 37:36.433
the way I was before.

37:36.467 --> 37:37.734
This is so awesome.
[mutters]

37:37.767 --> 37:39.233
She's such
a great little person.

37:39.266 --> 37:41.066
She brings people together.
[Nuray]
Hi, guys!

37:41.100 --> 37:43.266
Oh, my God!
[women cheering, applauding]

37:44.567 --> 37:46.066
[woman]
You look beautiful.

37:46.100 --> 37:49.667
[woman whistling]
[women cheering]

37:49.700 --> 37:53.033
[woman]
Nuray's future is endless.
That girl is amazing.

37:53.066 --> 37:56.567
Now with everything back
the way it's supposed to be,
she's unstoppable.

37:56.600 --> 37:58.600
And I can't wait to see
what the future holds for her.

37:58.633 --> 38:02.200
Hi! You look beautiful!
I'm so happy for you!
Thank you. Thanks.

38:02.233 --> 38:06.767
Before my surgery,
I had a lot of baggage
under my eyes.

38:07.000 --> 38:12.200
Now, thanks to Dr. Nassif,
I no longer cry
when I look at the mirror.

38:12.233 --> 38:15.066
And I'm finally back at work
doing what I love.

38:15.100 --> 38:17.467
How does it feel to not have
the sunglasses on?

38:17.500 --> 38:21.066
It's refreshing.
I don't need
the sunglasses anymore.

38:21.100 --> 38:23.600
And this chapter is closed.

38:23.633 --> 38:26.266
I'm so happy.
[women cheering, applauding]

38:26.300 --> 38:29.300
[laughing]
Aww.

38:31.300 --> 38:34.767
[Shamra] Since my surgery,
I see these nice,
beautiful breasts.

38:35.000 --> 38:37.100
Oh, my God!
Ohh!

38:40.133 --> 38:42.166
♪ I wanna be perfect ♪

38:43.400 --> 38:45.000
[Bahja] Hey!
[Shamra]
Hi.

38:45.033 --> 38:47.133
Wow, I've never been glad
to see you guys.

38:47.166 --> 38:48.600
[Dr. Dubrow]
Hello.
Hey.

38:48.633 --> 38:50.600
You got a little--
You got a smile on your face.

38:50.633 --> 38:51.667
I like it.
[Shamra]
Yeah.

38:51.700 --> 38:53.767
A new smile and new ta-tas.

38:54.000 --> 38:55.166
Yes.

38:55.200 --> 38:57.700
It's very rare
that we can say,

38:57.734 --> 38:59.333
"I've never seen this before,"
isn't it?

38:59.367 --> 39:00.700
Yeah. Is that what happened?
Yeah.

39:00.734 --> 39:03.200
Within the capsule,
which was all cracked,

39:03.233 --> 39:08.166
there were these big sections
of this plaster material

39:08.200 --> 39:09.734
that I pulled off.

39:09.767 --> 39:12.567
What?
It was like a very bizarre

39:12.600 --> 39:15.600
calcification phenomenon.
I've never seen it before.

39:15.633 --> 39:19.000
Dr. Dubrow has been doing this
for ages,

39:19.033 --> 39:22.767
and for him to say to me,
"I've never seen
anything like this"--

39:23.000 --> 39:27.033
Of course it makes me,
you know, uneasy, because
it's like, what the hell is it?

39:27.066 --> 39:31.567
So, today, you know,
it's all about,
are your nipples alive?

39:31.600 --> 39:34.066
Because, uh, it wouldn't
surprise me at all

39:34.100 --> 39:36.200
if they had
an impaired blood supply.

39:36.233 --> 39:38.100
So let's go ahead
and check that, okay?

39:38.133 --> 39:40.333
Yes.
Yes, Dr. Dubrow.
Please tell me--

39:40.367 --> 39:42.700
Yeah, believe me, your--
...when you look,
that the nipples are there.

39:42.734 --> 39:44.333
...your problem
is my problem.

39:44.367 --> 39:46.266
Lord Jesus, I'm never gonna hear
the end of this.

39:46.300 --> 39:48.367
If this nipple
is off of her body,

39:48.400 --> 39:52.734
and it's not on her breast,
we are not gonna hear
the end of it. [laughing]

39:52.767 --> 39:54.433
All right.
Let's see what's cooking.

39:54.467 --> 39:56.700
[Bahja]
Wow.
Don't say "wow" yet.

39:58.066 --> 39:59.600
Okay, you can say "wow."

39:59.633 --> 40:01.333
[both]
Wow.

40:01.367 --> 40:05.200
I feel so freakin' happy
that my nipples are alive.

40:05.233 --> 40:09.333
I could not imagine
taking a shower, and boom,
the nipple goes down the drain.

40:09.367 --> 40:13.767
My nipples are staying on me,
and that's the end
of that story.

40:14.000 --> 40:15.100
Bye.
Bye-bye.

40:15.133 --> 40:17.166
Bye-bye.

40:17.200 --> 40:19.400
Oh, my goodness.
[mutters]

40:19.433 --> 40:23.133
It looks, like, really good.
I'm so happy.

40:30.667 --> 40:33.233
When I originally had
my breasts done,

40:33.266 --> 40:35.400
I wanted nice, perky boobs.

40:35.433 --> 40:39.033
Unfortunately, I got
what felt like a baseball

40:39.066 --> 40:41.367
just lugging around
in my body every day.

40:41.400 --> 40:46.066
But tonight, I'm meeting up
with a bunch of my girlfriends,

40:46.100 --> 40:50.767
and I'm super-geeked
because it has been
at least five years

40:51.000 --> 40:55.433
since I had just really felt
like getting dressed up
and having fun.

40:55.467 --> 40:58.066
Man, when is she gonna come?

40:58.100 --> 41:00.266
I can't wait to see her.
I know. Me either.

41:00.300 --> 41:03.233
The anticipation
is driving me crazy.
I know.

41:03.266 --> 41:07.000
I'm ready to see how they look.
Y'all might need to hire
some extra security.

41:07.033 --> 41:08.767
Oh, the girls that
are gonna be out.
Yes...

41:09.000 --> 41:11.033
[laughter]

41:11.066 --> 41:14.200
Shamra always looks amazing
to me, no matter what.

41:14.233 --> 41:17.133
But I know how she feels
about her body,

41:17.166 --> 41:20.066
and hopefully
she's in better spirits,

41:20.100 --> 41:22.133
and she's ready to party.

41:24.166 --> 41:26.200
Oh, my God!
Ohh!

41:26.233 --> 41:29.433
[women applauding, cheering]

41:29.467 --> 41:32.266
[hooting, exclaiming]

41:34.166 --> 41:37.066
You know, hey, Shamra
got her groove back.
Let's go.

41:37.100 --> 41:38.467
Get on over here!
Come on!

41:38.500 --> 41:41.467
[women cheering]

41:41.500 --> 41:43.533
[Shamra]
Before my surgery
with Dr. Dubrow,

41:43.567 --> 41:45.300
I had huge nipples,

41:45.333 --> 41:49.100
my left breast was very hard,

41:49.133 --> 41:51.266
and on the right
I had rippling.

41:51.300 --> 41:54.300
But now, since my surgery,
I see these nice,

41:54.333 --> 41:56.300
normal,
beautiful breasts.

41:56.333 --> 41:59.300
I'm wanting to put on
nice, sexy shirts.

41:59.333 --> 42:01.467
It's Shamra's time,
and I can do me.

42:01.500 --> 42:03.300
[woman]
To Shamra's new life!
[woman 2] To Shamra!

42:03.333 --> 42:05.767
[women cheering]

42:06.000 --> 42:07.500
[exclaiming]

42:07.533 --> 42:10.433
Yes, girl!
[Tameka laughing]

42:12.467 --> 42:14.467
Hey, everybody.
No, it's "Har, everybody."

42:14.500 --> 42:15.533
Har...
Har...

42:15.567 --> 42:17.467
[both laughing]

42:17.500 --> 42:19.533
[announcer]
Everyone's favorite surgeons
are back.

42:19.567 --> 42:21.300
Aah!
Ohh!

42:23.033 --> 42:24.000
Whoa!

42:24.033 --> 42:25.200
You could be a flying squirrel.

42:25.233 --> 42:26.734
[laughing]

42:26.767 --> 42:28.433
[announcer]
And this time,
their patients

42:28.467 --> 42:30.333
are more extreme--
Hi.

42:30.367 --> 42:32.400
[woman]
I have broken chairs
with my butt.

42:32.433 --> 42:34.100
I have broken people
with my butt.

42:34.133 --> 42:37.266
This body condom
will be the death of me.

42:37.300 --> 42:38.734
I want, like, a Pikachu nose.

42:38.767 --> 42:41.500
Who wants to look
like a basic bitch?
[chuckles]

42:41.533 --> 42:44.333
I nearly died
from my plastic surgery.

42:44.367 --> 42:46.266
You were in a coma
after plastic surgery?
Yeah.

42:46.300 --> 42:49.300
My breasts are two
completely different sizes.

42:49.333 --> 42:50.400
Let me handle it.

42:50.433 --> 42:52.166
[women laughing]

42:52.200 --> 42:54.333
I got this syringe.
I would stab it,

42:54.367 --> 42:57.066
and then
I would suck it out.
[gasps]

42:57.100 --> 42:58.467
[announcer]
...and more botched than ever.

42:58.500 --> 43:01.367
I was left with no middle,
no bottom, nothing.

43:01.400 --> 43:03.300
[woman]
My skin was dying.

43:03.333 --> 43:06.133
She went from looking like me
to looking, like,
unrecognizable.

43:06.166 --> 43:08.533
Nobody wants
to be walking around
without a nose.

43:08.567 --> 43:11.300
You can actually see
skin from the front.

43:11.333 --> 43:13.066
To me, it looks like
I have balls.

43:13.100 --> 43:15.233
Oh, crap! I don't know
what the hell I'm gonna do.

43:15.266 --> 43:18.600
[announcer]
Will Dr. Nassif and Dr. Dubrow
solve these impossible cases--

43:18.633 --> 43:22.233
That's at risk
for the whole thing...
[imitates explosion]

43:22.266 --> 43:25.266
I might start this surgery,
then all of a sudden
just say, "I can't do it."

43:25.300 --> 43:28.367
[bleep]
What's worse than "bad"?
"Very bad."

43:28.400 --> 43:30.533
[announcer]
...and fix what others
wouldn't dare?

43:30.567 --> 43:33.066
You've changed my life.

43:33.100 --> 43:34.767
Thank you so much.
[Dr. Dubrow]
You're welcome.

43:35.000 --> 43:36.433
Whoo!

43:36.467 --> 43:39.233
Let's have a group hug.
