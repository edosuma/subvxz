00:04.160 --> 00:05.210
Who are you?

00:06.920 --> 00:08.860
I'm a poisoner by trade.

00:10.450 --> 00:12.560
Specifically speaking,
I’m your poisoner.

00:14.310 --> 00:15.600
Do you know where
the codes are?

00:16.450 --> 00:18.550
No.
I told you.

00:19.170 --> 00:19.760
Okay.

00:20.480 --> 00:21.710
We're gonna try that again.

00:22.980 --> 00:25.540
Do you know where
the codes are?

00:27.630 --> 00:28.290
Yes.

00:30.610 --> 00:32.030
How did you make me do that?

00:32.509 --> 00:34.730
My poison starts as truth serum.

00:34.765 --> 00:36.950
U assignment is simple, Mr. Whitney.

00:38.190 --> 00:39.270
Just get me my codes.

00:39.940 --> 00:43.730
You have approximately three hours,
give or take, before you die.

00:43.765 --> 00:45.720
As soon as I have my codes...

00:47.670 --> 00:49.160
I'll give you the antidote.

00:51.240 --> 00:52.640
- You ready?
- Maybe we're in over our heads.

00:52.675 --> 00:54.040
- It's time.
- Sure it's not too dangerous?

00:54.075 --> 00:55.495
- I'll be an inch away.
- I'm scared.

00:55.530 --> 00:57.980
Let's go over it again.
Make sure we have our bases covered.

01:00.680 --> 01:04.599
God, who'd thought going out to sushi with my
sister and her boyfriend would make me so freaked?

01:04.635 --> 01:06.760
Okay.
Last night we saw a movie.

01:07.100 --> 01:08.105
What was my snack of choice?

01:08.140 --> 01:10.440
Sprinkled milk duds over your popcorn.
What was I wearing?

01:10.475 --> 01:11.837
Blue top, little buttons.

01:11.872 --> 01:13.165
Oh, you like that one?

01:13.200 --> 01:15.080
I like all of 'em.
What movie were we...

01:15.960 --> 01:17.620
- why is this door locked?
- What are you doing?

01:22.350 --> 01:24.595
Girl on top.
Ms. Walker.

01:24.630 --> 01:26.555
When herrwienerlicious
signs your paycheck,

01:26.590 --> 01:29.630
I doubt he's factoring in make-out
breaks with your Boy-toy.

01:31.950 --> 01:34.020
I'm sorry.
I had to act fast.

01:36.000 --> 01:42.074

01:44.610 --> 01:46.150
I keep pressing the button
and nothing's happening.

01:46.185 --> 01:47.420
Is it fully charged?
'Cause sometimes this...

01:47.455 --> 01:49.375
My entire life is in this thing.
Okay?

01:49.410 --> 01:52.610
I got names, places, dates, times,
music, photos, recipes...

01:52.645 --> 01:54.460
Wow, uh, you-you cook, too?

01:54.710 --> 01:55.740
What if I lose everything?

01:56.280 --> 01:57.835
You know, I can't start from scratch.

01:57.870 --> 02:00.860
I can't be the person that I was
before this thing came along.

02:00.895 --> 02:02.230
Okay, I’m freaking out!

02:02.690 --> 02:03.920
Listen to me, uh...

02:03.955 --> 02:04.650
Lou.

02:05.040 --> 02:07.150
Lou? Really?
Lou, I wouldn't put...

02:07.185 --> 02:09.225
This is kind of my world, you know?

02:09.259 --> 02:11.190
This is what...
This is what I do, and I...

02:11.225 --> 02:12.820
I do it pretty good, so...

02:13.690 --> 02:14.620
Trust me.

02:16.250 --> 02:16.940
Okay.

02:18.020 --> 02:21.220
I know I’m totally spazzing out. I'm sorry.
It's just...

02:21.255 --> 02:23.135
A little overwhelming to even consider...

02:23.170 --> 02:24.940
No, no, no, no, no.
Don't go there. Come back.

02:24.975 --> 02:26.165
Go to a happy place.

02:26.200 --> 02:29.870
Is there something that you think about
that quiets the voices that are in your head?

02:34.070 --> 02:34.870
Turkey.

02:35.540 --> 02:36.780
Muenster cheese.

02:36.815 --> 02:37.747
Egg bread.

02:37.782 --> 02:38.680
Grilled.

02:40.320 --> 02:41.750
Was that a, was that a sandwich?

02:41.785 --> 02:43.030
Yeah, they're my passion.

02:43.850 --> 02:46.810
Uh, the...
Sounds, sounds pretty delicious.

02:47.120 --> 02:50.060
I own a deli in the mall and I often think
about meats and cheeses.

02:50.095 --> 02:52.240
Ah, yes.
Who doesn't?

02:54.000 --> 02:56.700
Look, i-i, uh, I promise you that if you
come back tomorrow,

02:56.735 --> 02:59.320
your phone will be all fixed up and
Good to go. Okay?

02:59.355 --> 03:00.280
- Really?
- Yeah.

03:00.580 --> 03:02.125
Thank you. So much.

03:02.160 --> 03:04.370
It's been nice talking with you, Chuck.

03:04.405 --> 03:06.090
Yeah, you too, Lou.

03:07.030 --> 03:09.870
That rhymed.
I-I- I didn’t actually mean for that to rhyme.

03:09.905 --> 03:11.500
- It's okay.
- Okay.

03:15.030 --> 03:16.920
* mind-cheater.

03:18.160 --> 03:20.380
* saw you.

03:21.120 --> 03:22.080
Saw me what?

03:22.400 --> 03:24.520
Saw you what?
Dude, are you kidding me?

03:24.555 --> 03:26.640
Mind-cheating with the broken phone girl.

03:26.675 --> 03:28.455
And why wouldn't you?

03:28.490 --> 03:31.590
Her hair looked so much like licorice,

03:31.960 --> 03:34.490
I wanna chew on it till I make myself sick.

03:35.010 --> 03:38.390
But you, well, gee whiz, Chuck,
you already have hair to chew on.

03:38.425 --> 03:40.980
What?
What the hell are you talking about?

03:42.770 --> 03:43.870
Name Sarah ring a...

03:44.440 --> 03:46.220
Hot blonde with two big bells?

03:50.100 --> 03:54.750
You know, just because you didn't actually do anything
with licorice hair doesn't mean you didn't want to.

03:56.030 --> 03:56.880
Think about that.

03:57.430 --> 04:00.340
- mind-cheater.
- Don't.

04:01.230 --> 04:02.460
- saw you.
- Get... Ah!

04:11.130 --> 04:13.190
<I>man: your assignment is
simple, Mr. Whitney

04:18.950 --> 04:22.070
my codes, they're still here.

04:29.220 --> 04:31.150
Oh, and also, and also a...

04:31.380 --> 04:34.785
A crab hand-roll for the lady.

04:34.820 --> 04:38.150
Light wasabi, but like light-light, almost
as if you just washed your hands

04:38.185 --> 04:41.160
and only the residue
of previous orders remains.

04:41.680 --> 04:43.705
Didn't realize how old-fashioned
you were, Chuck.

04:43.740 --> 04:45.730
Oh, why?
Cause I was ordering food for my girl?

04:45.765 --> 04:47.290
Well, I guess I just know what she likes.

04:47.325 --> 04:48.462
You sure do.

04:48.497 --> 04:49.698
Thanks, sweetie.

04:49.733 --> 04:50.900
Welcome, sweetie.

04:50.920 --> 04:53.550
No, no.
Old fashioned how slow you guys are taking things.

04:53.585 --> 04:54.380
- Devon...
- what?

04:54.750 --> 04:58.080
I mean you guy are joined at the hip,
but that's not where you're supposed to be joined.

04:58.680 --> 05:01.500
I mean it's like the east wing of our
apartment has taken a vow of celibacy.

05:02.490 --> 05:05.450
That is none of our business.
Um, edamame?

05:05.485 --> 05:06.750
Oh, your sleeve.

05:06.900 --> 05:07.705
Oh, shoot.

05:07.740 --> 05:09.600
Are you ever gonna 
retire that sweater, Ellie?

05:09.635 --> 05:10.320
Hope not.

05:10.750 --> 05:12.090
It's my lucky sweater.

05:12.510 --> 05:13.835
More like my lucky sweater.

05:13.870 --> 05:17.030
Was wearing it the first time I met Ellie
in an epidemiology class...

05:17.065 --> 05:20.160
He told me that I.L. Bean must've
stolen the color from my eyes,

05:20.195 --> 05:21.520
so it really belonged to me.

05:27.370 --> 05:29.140
Thank you for dinner.

05:33.240 --> 05:34.035
Well, you guys wait here.

05:34.070 --> 05:36.590
I'll get the car.
I found a space around the corner.

05:47.270 --> 05:49.130
Sir. Can you hear me?

05:49.560 --> 05:50.510
what is your name?

05:51.380 --> 05:52.980
Can someone please
call an ambulance?

05:53.900 --> 05:54.830
can you hear me, sir

05:55.780 --> 05:57.680
Shallow respiration, thready pulse.

05:57.715 --> 05:59.580
Chuck, check...
Check for medical id.

06:01.330 --> 06:02.160
Help me, please.
Help me.

06:02.300 --> 06:04.020
Just, just relax.
We're doing everything we can.

06:08.570 --> 06:09.755
That's my sister.

06:09.790 --> 06:12.450
Eleanor Fay Bartowski is
saving that dude's life!

06:26.820 --> 06:27.800
That's my sister.

06:28.540 --> 06:30.110
Saving that bad dude's life.

06:54.400 --> 07:08.640
www.opensubtitles.org
Chuck SO1EO8

07:16.650 --> 07:18.880
Hey, hey, do you think, uh,
do you think Ellie's okay?

07:18.915 --> 07:19.915
Should I call the hospital again?

07:19.950 --> 07:22.155
You've called ten times in the p
last 20 minutes.

07:22.190 --> 07:24.900
Yeah, I know, but what-what
about sweaty nuclear guy?

07:24.935 --> 07:25.735
What-what if he hurts her?

07:25.770 --> 07:28.880
Come on, Chuck. People saw Ellie
at the ER. She is gonna be fine.

07:30.340 --> 07:31.495
you spending the night?

07:31.530 --> 07:34.595
My little pep talk must've inspired you guys.
Mazel tov.

07:34.630 --> 07:38.920
Yeah, uh, actually, Sarah’s just hanging
out until Ellie gets home.

07:38.955 --> 07:40.120
Why? She's a doctor, chuck.

07:40.155 --> 07:41.365
Emergencies happen.

07:41.400 --> 07:44.170
You know, when somebody asks,
"is there a doctor in the house?

07:44.690 --> 07:45.335
" that's our cue.

07:45.370 --> 07:46.930
I'm gonna make some coffee.
Do you want some?

07:46.965 --> 07:48.100
Absolutely.

07:49.310 --> 07:52.470
Listen, I know it's been a while since
you've taken your, uh...

07:53.760 --> 07:55.705
Your bike out for a ride, you know.

07:55.740 --> 07:58.860
But it is time to oil up that rusty chain, x

07:58.900 --> 08:01.620
hop on that seat, and
start pedaling away, bro.

08:01.655 --> 08:03.410
You never forget how to ride, okay.

08:03.445 --> 08:04.130
Lock it out.

08:05.550 --> 08:06.160
Come on.

08:07.590 --> 08:08.280
Nice.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.580
Aw, hey, there she is.

08:11.370 --> 08:12.285
Hi, honey.

08:12.320 --> 08:13.705
Ellie! Oh, my god! Oh, my god!

08:13.740 --> 08:17.250
Oh, my god, you're okay.
Oh, my god, you're fine. You're fine.

08:17.285 --> 08:20.240
Why wouldn't she be fine?

08:20.275 --> 08:21.165
What happened?

08:21.200 --> 08:24.480
We tried everything. Nothing worked.
I think he was...

08:25.170 --> 08:27.930
Poisoned or had an allergic
reaction or something.

08:27.965 --> 08:30.230
I'm going to bed. Good night, guys.

08:30.265 --> 08:32.059
- Night, guys.
- Good night.

08:32.095 --> 08:34.000
- Night.
- Night.

08:34.460 --> 08:37.900
I'm getting way too comfortable lying
and sneaking around all this spy stuff, okay.

08:37.934 --> 08:40.059
I'm starting to feel that that is my real life.

08:40.095 --> 08:40.934
It's all to be expected.

08:40.970 --> 08:42.914
It's an existential spy crisis of sorts.

08:42.950 --> 08:44.360
It used to be all
compartmentalized, you know.

08:44.395 --> 08:45.755
Chuck world and spy world.

08:45.790 --> 08:47.700
But when I watched those
ambulance doors close

08:47.735 --> 08:49.610
and my sister was behind
them with that sweaty

08:49.645 --> 08:53.210
Nuclear spy freak,
my worlds collided.

08:53.410 --> 08:54.745
I put Ellie's life in danger.

08:54.780 --> 08:57.575
No, chuck, that guy was sick with or
without the intersect in your head.

08:57.610 --> 09:02.180
And spy world or no, Ellie helped that guy
because that is what she is trained to do.

09:04.940 --> 09:06.050
Yeah, I guess so.

09:09.750 --> 09:12.070
There's something else I
have to talk to you about.

09:13.750 --> 09:14.455
What's that?

09:14.490 --> 09:16.860
I'm a little worried about our cover.

09:17.310 --> 09:19.020
I think it's time for us to make love.

09:24.460 --> 09:25.680
It's a hot coffee.

09:29.420 --> 09:32.190
<I>Beckman: the intersect was correct
in identifying Mason Whitney;

09:32.225 --> 09:33.935
subject had nuclear Intel.

09:33.970 --> 09:37.640
However, Bartowski incorrectly
perceived Whitney as a threat.

09:37.675 --> 09:39.182
Chuck's not wrong very often.

09:39.217 --> 09:40.655
But he's annoying all the time.

09:40.690 --> 09:44.815
Whitney was a programmer for a
top-secret project, code name: "sanctuary.

09:44.850 --> 09:48.935
" when Whitney disappeared, so did the
sanctuary data embedded on a computer chip.

09:48.970 --> 09:54.180
Wait. So whoever has the chip essentially
has a skeleton key to access our nuclear facilities?

09:54.215 --> 09:55.435
Precisely, agent walker.

09:55.470 --> 09:58.830
In the wrong hands,
this is potentially catastrophic.

09:58.865 --> 10:01.375
Casey, bring chuck with you to e morgue.

10:01.410 --> 10:05.460
Maybe there's a clue only he can see
to ascertain Whitney’s true cause of death.

10:05.495 --> 10:08.182
Agent walker,
search the body for the missing codes.

10:08.217 --> 10:10.870
Maybe there's a chance he still
has them on him.

10:16.760 --> 10:18.885
Dude.
This is weird.

10:18.920 --> 10:20.435
You're back from lunch on time.

10:20.470 --> 10:22.705
Big mike's working
me to the bone, dude.

10:22.740 --> 10:25.575
He's got me on some extra assignment,
says it was super secret.

10:25.610 --> 10:28.575
Don't tell me because if you tell me,
it's not gonna be a secret...

10:28.610 --> 10:31.540
Wants me to help tang's wife pick
out a gift for their anniversary.

10:31.830 --> 10:33.860
Well, that's great.
I mean he trusts you.

10:33.895 --> 10:35.890
No, no, dude, I don't have time for this.

10:35.925 --> 10:37.535
I'm a very busy man-boy.

10:37.570 --> 10:40.410
Morgan, think of it like this: think of it
as an opportunity to learn something

10:40.445 --> 10:44.400
you'd otherwise
Never know about our freakish leader.

10:46.120 --> 10:47.580
O... Kay.

10:52.250 --> 10:53.955
Ms. Harry tang?

10:53.990 --> 10:56.530
Thick mike say you help me
pick prize for Harry.

10:56.880 --> 10:58.435
Yeah, hi, I’m Morgan.

10:58.470 --> 10:59.955
Shh, bigger secret.

10:59.990 --> 11:02.080
Poopie-cat is the jealous type.

11:02.340 --> 11:03.550
Keep it under your head.

11:03.930 --> 11:06.125
Morgan: have any idea
what Harry wants?

11:06.160 --> 11:08.320
Poppy: I buy him plasma TV,
biggt you got.

11:08.630 --> 11:09.390
Okay.

11:09.580 --> 11:11.010
I'm gonna go
draw up the paperwork.

11:11.610 --> 11:13.930
Harry be so happy!
Eat it up.

11:14.260 --> 11:16.410
Give me some sugar, sugar.

11:16.720 --> 11:19.260
- Oh, yeah, there's some sugar.
- This'll be helpful to us one day, Jeffrey.

11:19.295 --> 11:21.300
Meet me in the home theater
room tomorrow night.

11:22.140 --> 11:24.305
Knowledge is power.

11:24.340 --> 11:26.810
My mom used to say
"knowledge is powder.

11:28.940 --> 11:30.270
" you don't talk about your mom much.

11:30.610 --> 11:33.650
She's doing a stretch up in the
state pen at chowchilla.

11:35.200 --> 11:36.140
Move, move.

11:45.590 --> 11:48.090
Okay, just give me the verdict,
chuck; I can take it.

11:48.480 --> 11:49.185
You sure you want to hear?

11:49.220 --> 11:50.585
If you're teasing me, please stop.

11:50.620 --> 11:52.110
If you're not teasing me, don't lie to me.

11:53.260 --> 11:54.920
Good as new-ish.

11:55.320 --> 11:56.860
I don't believe you.

11:57.170 --> 11:59.900
You can learn a lot about a person
through their cell phone, by the way.

11:59.935 --> 12:03.580
For example, I saw that you listed your
nana first, under "a nana.

12:04.560 --> 12:05.400
" thank you.

12:05.810 --> 12:06.800
Hey, yeah.

12:07.100 --> 12:08.315
You really saved my ass, chuck.

12:08.350 --> 12:10.660
Wow, you love your nana and you have
the mouth of a trucker.

12:10.695 --> 12:12.270
You're a very complicated woman, Lou.

12:12.305 --> 12:13.390
I brought you something.

12:13.425 --> 12:14.450
For fixing it.

12:14.790 --> 12:15.470
Thanks.

12:18.880 --> 12:19.750
A sandwich?

12:19.810 --> 12:24.005
it is a.. the sandwich,
turkey, monster egg bread

12:24.040 --> 12:28.200
...I'm even gonna call it
"The Chuck Bartowski "

12:29.050 --> 12:32.240
I... I can't believe you gonna
name a sandwich after me.

12:33.000 --> 12:36.640
you know, you should come by the
shop sometime and taste it fresh.

12:38.610 --> 12:40.110
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

12:40.640 --> 12:42.815
Yes, I’d love that.

12:42.850 --> 12:45.380
Lou, this is kind of the biggest honor...

12:45.415 --> 12:46.097
Sarah!

12:46.132 --> 12:47.870
Hi.
I'm Sarah.

12:51.990 --> 12:53.910
Lou...
Lou is her name.

12:53.945 --> 12:54.635
This is Lou.

12:54.670 --> 12:58.010
I was fixing Lou’s phone for her, Lou.

12:59.520 --> 13:00.720
Who's that?
That's Sarah.

13:00.755 --> 13:02.017
sh-she said that.

13:02.052 --> 13:04.106
Uh, who's Sarah?

13:04.141 --> 13:06.160
Sarah... Is..

13:07.080 --> 13:09.280
What's the best way to describe...

13:09.760 --> 13:12.870
- Sarah is my...
- girlfriend

13:14.030 --> 13:14.810
Sarah: nice to meet you.

13:15.720 --> 13:17.310
Nice to meet you, Sarah.

13:17.890 --> 13:22.100
Uh, you should refrigerate that 'cause
it'd be a shame for the chuck to make you sick.

13:22.410 --> 13:24.340
Yes, absolutely, I...

13:25.100 --> 13:25.860
Great idea.

13:28.000 --> 13:31.080
Uh, there's more to the Mason Whitney
incident than we thought.

13:32.680 --> 13:33.880
Let's go Chuck!

13:35.980 --> 13:37.165
Chuck: okay, this is just a storage room.

13:37.200 --> 13:39.755
They just happen to
store people in this room,

13:39.790 --> 13:42.330
people who are no longer breathing
and who are refrigerated.

13:42.365 --> 13:44.320
- Man up, Bartowski.
- Got to store 'em somewhere.

13:44.740 --> 13:46.810
Better than stacked up on a
curb like garbage, right?

13:49.320 --> 13:50.320
Eyes on the prize.

13:50.355 --> 13:51.320
Getting any flashes?

13:52.060 --> 13:53.540
Good lord, the man is naked!

13:54.580 --> 13:56.580
Appears rigor mortis has set in, too.

14:03.460 --> 14:04.270
Find anything?

14:04.710 --> 14:06.005
Nothing yet.

14:06.040 --> 14:07.300
No codes.

14:08.020 --> 14:09.990
Hang on a second.
What is this?

14:10.580 --> 14:14.250
man: I appreciate you taking
the time to answer my questions, Dr. Bartowski.

14:14.285 --> 14:14.930
Not at all.

14:15.750 --> 14:20.820
Okay, now, did the deceased
hand anything to you?

14:21.240 --> 14:21.770
No.

14:22.430 --> 14:23.940
Say anything specific to you?

14:25.210 --> 14:27.410
He just asked me to help him.

14:28.390 --> 14:30.430
Did you hide anything for him?

14:32.050 --> 14:33.210
I beg your pardon?

14:33.650 --> 14:36.210
Did he transfer anything to your person?

14:37.400 --> 14:39.560
I've told you everything I know, officer.

14:39.595 --> 14:41.510
I'm sorry if I can't be more help.

14:41.545 --> 14:42.605
That's all right.

14:42.640 --> 14:44.745
Okay, I think we have everything we need.

14:44.780 --> 14:47.600
If you don't mind, I’d just like to get a
quick photo for the records.

14:55.180 --> 14:56.100
Bug.

14:58.080 --> 14:59.160
All right.

15:00.700 --> 15:05.335
Actually, I’m just going to move
your hair back a bit.

15:05.370 --> 15:09.970
It's just a protocol required for the framing.
Okay.

15:10.700 --> 15:11.430
Now...

15:11.640 --> 15:14.380
Say "cheesecake.

15:15.110 --> 15:16.280
" cheesecake.

15:21.540 --> 15:22.430
What is it?

15:23.200 --> 15:24.490
The guy was poisoned.

15:24.870 --> 15:26.655
Toxic derivative of pentothal.

15:26.690 --> 15:29.175
Initially, the subject becomes
uncontrollably truthful.

15:29.210 --> 15:35.440
After it accumulates in the occipital lobe, victim
suffers from unconsciousness and eventually... Death.

15:36.130 --> 15:38.230
- What's the timeline on this thing?
- Can't say. 

15:38.650 --> 15:39.590
Could be a couple hours.

15:39.980 --> 15:41.660
Could be minutes depending
on the concentration.

15:44.030 --> 15:47.080
I just need you to sign this affidavit
and we'll be all done.

16:09.430 --> 16:12.940
If I think of anything else,
I will be sure to let you know.

16:12.975 --> 16:13.800
I'm sure you will.

16:16.530 --> 16:17.610
Have a good day, sir.

16:20.790 --> 16:22.630
Tiniest cop I’ve ever seen.

16:32.300 --> 16:33.465
You know the rules, walker.

16:33.500 --> 16:35.590
Not while the green's
out of the machine.

16:36.450 --> 16:38.650
Your parents did real number
on you, didn't they?

16:38.685 --> 16:39.920
Yes, they did.

16:40.990 --> 16:42.500
Hi. Come here.

16:46.640 --> 16:49.400
I just wanted to make sure we're all
set for tonight's mission.

16:49.435 --> 16:50.965
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.490
I mean, it's, you know, it's been a while
since I’ve slept with someone-

16:53.525 --> 16:56.795
<I>no-no-not, not slept
With someone, but slept with s...

16:56.830 --> 16:58.790
it's actually been a while since
I’ve done either one, so...

16:59.510 --> 17:02.860
Chuck, listen, I know this is
kind of uncomfortable.

17:02.895 --> 17:03.745
I'm fine. It's fine.

17:03.780 --> 17:05.160
- It's just that we have to do it...
- Got it.

17:05.194 --> 17:07.186
- mean not, not do it.
- I got it.

17:07.222 --> 17:09.180
- so we don't blow...
- I got it.

17:09.230 --> 17:11.140
- Our cover.
- I got it. I got it.

17:14.089 --> 17:18.400
Okay.
Lou!

17:19.040 --> 17:20.710
Hey!Hey, hey.

17:21.490 --> 17:23.750
Hey, hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, Lou, listen.

17:23.785 --> 17:25.410
About earlier with Sarah, I can explain.

17:25.444 --> 17:26.365
Forget it, chuck.

17:26.400 --> 17:28.650
You don't have to be single to
fix a broken phone, right?

17:28.685 --> 17:30.380
Maybe our signals just got crossed.

17:30.415 --> 17:32.275
No, no, not at all.
That's...

17:32.310 --> 17:33.710
That's kind of what I’m trying to
say is that they...

17:33.745 --> 17:34.975
They weren't crossed.

17:35.010 --> 17:38.400
You know, Sarah and I, me and Sarah,
that whole thing, it's really very...

17:41.350 --> 17:42.690
It's complicated?

17:43.220 --> 17:45.190
Well, is she your girlfriend or not?

17:46.240 --> 17:49.355
Well, yeah, sort of,
kind of hard to explain.

17:49.390 --> 17:51.375
I really, really, very badly wish
that I could explain.

17:51.410 --> 17:55.410
Listen, if you're not going to tell me the truth,
I’ll tell you. Okay?

17:56.340 --> 17:57.200
I like you.

17:58.050 --> 18:00.560
I like almost everything about you.

18:00.595 --> 18:03.035
I think you're cute, you're funny.

18:03.070 --> 18:05.310
Our vast height difference intrigues me.

18:06.830 --> 18:08.200
But want to know what I don't like?

18:08.235 --> 18:09.205
Very, very much.

18:09.240 --> 18:13.130
I think anyone who cheats on his
girlfriend is a big, fat, stupid jackass.

18:14.020 --> 18:15.510
Exactly, I concur.

18:16.440 --> 18:18.560
Of course you do, which is why I like you.

18:21.420 --> 18:22.560
Why don't we do this, okay?

18:23.070 --> 18:29.540
If your situation ever gets less complicated,
you just let me know. Okay?

18:30.090 --> 18:32.210
Okay. Yeah.

18:33.390 --> 18:34.120
Lou: I got it.

18:35.290 --> 18:37.740
Have a great day.
Drive safe.

18:41.440 --> 18:43.810
Morgan meet me in the home theater
room tomorrow night.

18:44.350 --> 18:45.200
Again.

18:47.020 --> 18:48.860
You sure, Harry?
You've watched it, like, 20 times.

18:48.895 --> 18:49.860
Again!

18:53.860 --> 18:56.110
Meet me in the home theater
room tomorrow night.

18:56.400 --> 18:57.420
Again!

19:00.070 --> 19:02.540
Meet me in the home theater
room tomorrow night.

19:08.170 --> 19:09.290
Let's watch it again.

19:39.780 --> 19:41.000
Ellie let me in

19:43.030 --> 19:43.940
Wow, chuck.

19:44.460 --> 19:46.470
What do you think is going to
happen here tonight?

19:47.220 --> 19:47.980
Why?

19:48.470 --> 19:50.405
What do you, what do you think I think?

19:50.440 --> 19:53.025
Well, I don't know, the, the candles and the music.

19:53.060 --> 19:57.060
I mean, you do know we're just spending
the night together for cover, right?

19:57.095 --> 19:58.035
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:58.070 --> 20:00.660
Why, why would I possibly think
anything else?

20:01.130 --> 20:05.440
I mean, by now I’d say I’m pretty familiar
with the concept of faking it, so...

20:06.590 --> 20:09.130
Sarah chuck, we've got to take this
assignment seriously.

20:09.165 --> 20:10.740
Chuck: okay, I’ll lose the music.

20:13.900 --> 20:15.360
You can change in the bathroom.

20:15.395 --> 20:16.210
That's okay.

20:21.530 --> 20:22.355
What?

20:22.390 --> 20:25.930
You're giving me crap about lighting
some candles and you come in wearing that?

20:26.480 --> 20:28.900
What, this? This, this is part of my cover.

20:29.310 --> 20:30.505
Well, it doesn't cover a thing.

20:30.540 --> 20:32.135
And what if Ellie or awesome were to walk in?

20:32.170 --> 20:37.290
This is exactly what a girlfriend would wear
to seduce her boyfriend I am just being professional.

20:37.930 --> 20:38.580
Yeah...

20:39.470 --> 20:41.360
The world's oldest profession.

20:42.040 --> 20:42.885
Oh...

20:42.920 --> 20:44.765
Well, that's real nice, chuck.

20:44.800 --> 20:46.700
What is the matter with you tonight anyway?

20:58.510 --> 20:59.770
Captain want to watch some TV, babe?

21:00.220 --> 21:01.650
Ellie: no, read a book.

21:01.900 --> 21:03.400
Fine, I’ve got work to do.

21:04.210 --> 21:06.830
You think chuck's going to seal the
deal with Sarah tonight?

21:06.865 --> 21:08.740
Gross, you're talking about my brother.

21:09.100 --> 21:14.940
He's got your genes, babe, and I ought to
know the Bartowskis are very passionate people.

21:15.490 --> 21:18.440
Remember the last time we spent the night
at your parents' house?

21:19.620 --> 21:22.010
I found em bouncing around in the Jacuzzi.

21:22.990 --> 21:24.515
Whoa.
Brain stamp.

21:24.550 --> 21:26.940
Shoe doesn't feel so great when it's
on the other foot, now, does it?

21:31.950 --> 21:33.415
And you know what?
You know what?

21:33.450 --> 21:36.295
What's up, what's up with the porno shorts, huh?

21:36.330 --> 21:40.590
I mean, clearly Mrs. Heditsian likes to
enjoy all the hills and valleys,

21:40.690 --> 21:43.960
but really, really they leave, like, nothing
To the imagination!

21:46.430 --> 21:48.750
Okay. Babe, your uh...

21:49.140 --> 21:54.010
Your mood tonight is super-honest,
and I think that's awesome.

21:55.790 --> 21:57.160
And then there's that.

21:58.010 --> 21:58.875
Ellie "awesome.

21:58.910 --> 22:02.130
" everything is so freaking "awesome.

22:02.165 --> 22:03.035
" let me tell you something.

22:03.070 --> 22:08.330
If everything is awesome and there is no unawesome,
then "awesome" by definition is just Mediocre!

22:08.365 --> 22:11.625
And when was the last time you did
something nice for me?

22:11.660 --> 22:14.840
Just bought me something for no
reason just because it's a Monday?

22:14.875 --> 22:17.780
We're starting to und like
them, aren't we?

22:20.110 --> 22:21.150
A little.

22:26.600 --> 22:27.530
Are you okay?

22:28.270 --> 22:29.840
Is there anything you want to talk about?

22:36.970 --> 22:39.170
What exactly are the rules with our...

22:40.710 --> 22:43.470
Like you know, our, our thing?

22:44.290 --> 22:45.340
What do you mean?

22:46.690 --> 22:48.920
What do I...
What do I mean?

22:50.240 --> 22:52.880
I mean hypothetically speaking,
are we allowed to see other people?

22:52.915 --> 22:54.535
Well, uh...

22:54.570 --> 22:58.925
Our cover is boyfriend/girlfriend,
so tactically, that would be challenging.

22:58.960 --> 23:05.100
Plus any prospective date would have to endure a
rigorous vetting process to determine her motivation.

23:06.870 --> 23:08.605
Wouldn't her motivation be love?

23:08.640 --> 23:10.900
Ideally, but you're a very important
piece of intelligence,

23:10.935 --> 23:12.940
and you have to be handled with
extreme care.

23:13.120 --> 23:14.730
Well, that sounds very nice.

23:15.720 --> 23:19.500
Chuck, I don't have to be a spy to
piece together the clues here.

23:19.535 --> 23:22.500
You're interested in that Lou girl,
aren't you?

23:23.950 --> 23:25.290
Well, I...

23:26.590 --> 23:27.520
Come on, babe.

23:27.555 --> 23:28.915
Get back in bed.
You know what?

23:28.950 --> 23:30.885
I think I’m just 
going to sleep on the floor.

23:30.920 --> 23:32.770
Sarah, Chuck, we can't compromise our cover.

23:32.805 --> 23:34.620
Chuck well, I feel compromised already.

23:38.210 --> 23:41.240
I have known him since the day
he was born obviously.

23:41.490 --> 23:42.405
When people would ask him
what he wanted to be

23:42.440 --> 23:46.370
when he grew up, he would always
say the same thing: "big boy.

23:46.405 --> 23:47.585
" how cute is that?

23:47.620 --> 23:49.465
Ellie, you're killing me here.

23:49.500 --> 23:51.275
<I>and now he is a big boy.

23:51.310 --> 23:54.330
and I can tell that he is
because he is with a big...

23:54.840 --> 23:55.740
Big girl.

23:55.775 --> 23:56.605
Sorry, guys.

23:56.640 --> 23:58.600
Don't mean to muck up your mojo.

23:58.635 --> 23:59.440
Tried to stop her.

23:59.475 --> 24:00.285
Is she drunk?

24:00.320 --> 24:01.455
Ellie: chuck, you need a haircut.

24:01.490 --> 24:03.170
It's starting to make funny animal shapes.

24:03.205 --> 24:04.005
Captain: let's go, babe.

24:04.040 --> 24:05.665
These two need their privacy, huh?

24:05.700 --> 24:08.730
When you were seven, I told you that a
burglar stole the money from your piggy bank.

24:08.765 --> 24:09.775
That was a lie.
It was me. x

24:09.810 --> 24:13.340
At the time, I felt it was very important
for me to have a back street boys fanny pack.

24:14.640 --> 24:15.935
Ellie, are you okay?

24:15.970 --> 24:18.440
Have you done anything
out of the ordinary?

24:20.230 --> 24:21.650
Words taste like peaches.

24:22.050 --> 24:23.775
Captain: okay, we going to go now.

24:23.810 --> 24:26.910
Let you kids get back to doing
whatever it is you're doing.

24:27.260 --> 24:29.120
Have fun, all right.

24:33.560 --> 24:35.640
Hey, sorry to bother you folks.
Can you spare some milk? All out.

24:35.675 --> 24:37.020
Moo juice coming right up.

24:40.840 --> 24:42.620
Casey, what are you doing here?

24:42.655 --> 24:43.780
Getting some cross talk.

24:45.120 --> 24:46.075
Why?
What from?

24:46.110 --> 24:49.440
Those pajamas maja you look like
Dennis the menace's father.

24:56.550 --> 24:58.300
Ellie.
Ellie, Ellie!

25:12.660 --> 25:14.430
Well, she was poisoned.

25:29.210 --> 25:30.395
Pulled the vio surveillance.

25:30.430 --> 25:33.390
Man, posing as an officer, exposed
your sister to the poison.

25:33.790 --> 25:35.380
Why would anyone want to hurt Ellie?

25:37.200 --> 25:39.040
She doesn't know anything
about nuclear codes.

25:39.075 --> 25:40.845
She doesn't even want us to
own a microwave.

25:40.880 --> 25:43.060
That's good news,
means the person who poisoned her is

25:43.095 --> 25:44.577
Still out there looking
for the Intel chip.

25:44.612 --> 25:46.025
No, no, no, no, no.
There is no good news.

25:46.060 --> 25:49.375
Okay, you just told me that my sister was
poisoned by the same stuff as a dead guy.

25:49.410 --> 25:53.550
Chuck, our medical teams are trying to identify
the poisoning agent to create an antidote for Ellie.

25:53.585 --> 25:54.165
There's no time!

25:54.200 --> 25:57.450
If it's the same poison as the dead guy,
that means Ellie’s only got a few hours left.

25:57.485 --> 25:58.075
Look, this is easy.

25:58.110 --> 26:01.920
All we've got to do is find the codes, and we
get the bad guy to trade us for the antidote.

26:01.955 --> 26:03.395
Okay, we do this kind of
thing in our sleep.

26:03.430 --> 26:06.215
Even if we knew where the codes were,
that's not a practical plan.

26:06.250 --> 26:09.000
Can't risk the bad guy endangering
millions of lives for the one.

26:09.035 --> 26:10.440
This is my sister
we're talking about, all right?

26:10.475 --> 26:12.670
We can't just sit around and watch her die.

26:14.850 --> 26:18.400
Sarah: okay, the only clue we have so
far is the bug that we found on Ellie.

26:19.350 --> 26:20.305
Soundproof box.

26:20.340 --> 26:22.210
Don't want the bad guy
knowing we're onto him.

26:22.700 --> 26:24.950
We've got a team working on
reversing the tracking signal.

26:25.450 --> 26:26.340
Hey, what are you doing?

26:26.375 --> 26:27.555
No! Found the codes.

26:27.590 --> 26:28.935
Can't believe where
mason Whitney hid them.

26:28.970 --> 26:31.770
I'm going to keep them on the lady
doctor until we can move them safely.

26:36.390 --> 26:37.940
Now the bad guy's going to come to us.

26:39.080 --> 26:40.630
Not bad, Bartowski.

26:41.780 --> 26:43.480
Do that ever again and I’ll kill you.

26:48.100 --> 26:49.810
I'm going to fix this, Ellie, I swear.

26:52.100 --> 26:56.990
Look, I know that you just think
I’m just chuck, your screw-up little brother.

26:58.090 --> 26:59.990
But there's a lot about me you don't know.

27:04.760 --> 27:06.440
See, I’m, I’m...

27:08.520 --> 27:10.690
I'm also chuck, the guy with all these...

27:11.240 --> 27:13.300
Important government secrets in my brain.

27:15.610 --> 27:16.780
<I>I can make this better.

27:16.815 --> 27:17.950
I will make this better.

27:22.260 --> 27:23.605
everything is so different now.

27:23.640 --> 27:25.145
Ellie, everything is so different now.

27:25.180 --> 27:29.190
I used to be able to come you, and
ask your advice about anything.

27:30.710 --> 27:33.440
And now, my whole life is, like, a lie.

27:44.740 --> 27:47.690
Went downstairs to get Ellie’s
sweater from her locker.

27:49.310 --> 27:50.610
Her lucky sweater.

27:51.390 --> 27:52.370
She could use it.

27:53.450 --> 27:54.930
Thanks, Devon.

29:08.830 --> 29:09.630
Okay.

29:11.480 --> 29:12.650
I've got what you want.

29:13.220 --> 29:15.620
The antidote to save
your doctor friend.

29:16.140 --> 29:17.120
Give it to her.

29:17.520 --> 29:18.520
She might live.

29:19.500 --> 29:21.090
Just trade me for the codes.

29:22.420 --> 29:23.380
Or...

29:23.890 --> 29:28.690
I can poison all of you and force you to
tell me where you've hidden my codes.

29:29.560 --> 29:33.760
And then you'll die, too,
just like the doctor.

29:36.680 --> 29:37.810
Your choice.

29:38.330 --> 29:40.320
I found them! I found them!
I found them.

29:40.680 --> 29:43.260
I got the codes. The codes are on
the necklace. I found them

29:57.570 --> 29:58.740
Wait!

30:31.470 --> 30:33.210
Casey, wait, what about Chuck?

30:34.950 --> 30:35.570
Here.

30:35.980 --> 30:37.175
No, no, it's for Ellie.

30:37.210 --> 30:39.360
No, I’m sorry. There's no debate.
It has to be you.

30:39.395 --> 30:40.190
You're the intersect.

30:40.320 --> 30:42.320
I won't take it knowing that
Ellie will die without it,

30:42.355 --> 30:43.535
that both of you have been
poisoned, too.

30:43.570 --> 30:46.190
You're a good person, chuck,
and I respect that, but I got a job to do.

30:46.225 --> 30:47.690
So take it before I shove
it down your throat.

30:47.725 --> 30:49.110
Okay, okay, fine. I'll do it.

30:49.145 --> 30:49.865
Thank you.

30:49.900 --> 30:50.855
I'll pretend to agree to take it,

30:50.890 --> 30:53.020
then I’ll run like hell to my sister's
room and make her take it.

30:53.055 --> 30:54.140
Why did I just say that out loud?

30:54.175 --> 30:54.815
It's the poison.

30:54.850 --> 30:55.835
It makes you tell the truth.

30:55.870 --> 30:57.390
You do that, I’ll give chase,
put a gun to your head,

30:57.425 --> 30:58.910
threaten to pull the trigger
if you don't take it.

30:59.310 --> 31:00.105
Would you really shoot me?

31:00.140 --> 31:01.460
- No.
- Yeah, don't waste the bullet.

31:01.495 --> 31:02.470
We're already dead.

31:02.570 --> 31:03.620
I'm saving my sister.

31:29.120 --> 31:31.950
you know, if I had a blog this would be
a really big day for me.

31:32.750 --> 31:34.500
Do my laundry?
Check.

31:35.290 --> 31:37.750
Save my sister's life?
Check.

31:37.760 --> 31:39.300
Save my own life?

31:40.080 --> 31:41.180
Final entry.

31:42.400 --> 31:45.060
I am so sorry about all of this.

31:46.120 --> 31:48.090
That's okay.
That's okay.

31:48.120 --> 31:50.655
It's not ideal, but I’ve lived a pretty
good life, you know?

31:50.690 --> 31:56.610
I mean, how many guys can say they've landed a
helicopter and saved the lives of innocent people?

31:56.780 --> 31:59.425
Courageous and honorable members
of the united states military.

31:59.460 --> 32:03.640
And hey, and the silver lining is now
I don't have to work out my five-year plan again.

32:03.780 --> 32:06.170
Streamlined that down to about five hours.

32:23.270 --> 32:24.555
Bad guy's name is Riordan Payne.

32:24.590 --> 32:26.495
Used to be an Olympic gymnast,
blew out his knee.

32:26.530 --> 32:29.635
Now he sells hard-to-find items,
like nuclear codes, to hard-to-find people.

32:29.670 --> 32:33.010
Lots of people want to spend lots of cash on
these codes, but they're not going to get the chance.

32:33.250 --> 32:34.060
Oh. Why not?

32:34.100 --> 32:36.090
Because this thing's going
to lead us right to him.

33:00.780 --> 33:01.310
- I got it.
- I got it

33:01.345 --> 33:02.155
I got it.

33:02.190 --> 33:03.150
Well, who's better at it?

33:03.750 --> 33:04.490
I am.

33:04.540 --> 33:05.960
She is damn true serum.

33:15.120 --> 33:16.400
God, you're so pretty.

33:19.260 --> 33:22.360
Casey, your jaw was chiseled
by Michelangelo himself.

33:23.490 --> 33:23.990
Thank you.

33:24.010 --> 33:25.050
Oh, yeah.

33:34.380 --> 33:35.935
Payne: yes?
Who is it?

33:35.970 --> 33:40.460
The NSA, CIA and me, who's a
little tougher to explain, but...

33:43.750 --> 33:44.790
We all have our skill set.

33:46.280 --> 33:46.970
Sarah: freeze.

33:49.170 --> 33:51.940
My partner would rather shoot you in
the face than let you get away.

33:52.370 --> 33:53.360
You called me your partner?

33:55.340 --> 33:56.600
Where are the codes,
you son of a bitch?

33:56.635 --> 33:57.430
Where's the antidote?

33:58.190 --> 34:01.820
Actually, I was just about to enjoy
a little antidote myself.

34:02.640 --> 34:05.540
What kind of host would I be if I
didn't offer you some as well?

34:09.219 --> 34:10.425
(gun chamber clicking) Careful there.

34:10.460 --> 34:11.630
Haven't killed anyone in a while.

34:11.665 --> 34:12.460
Getting a little hungry.

34:25.719 --> 34:27.670
No, no, no! Wait, wait, wait!
Don't, don't, don't!

34:28.150 --> 34:29.210
You have a flash?

34:29.570 --> 34:30.210
No.

34:30.650 --> 34:32.469
No.
I've just read tons of comic books.

34:35.449 --> 34:37.120
And the villain always
samples it first.

34:42.670 --> 34:44.090
Good one, chuck.

34:45.130 --> 34:45.969
All right.

35:01.640 --> 35:03.190
Very un-sportsman-like.

35:05.660 --> 35:06.600
I like it.

35:08.420 --> 35:11.630
The antidote's in the cabinet,
bottom right shelf.

35:12.630 --> 35:13.725
Key is in my pocket.

35:13.760 --> 35:15.550
Codes are in my right shoe.

35:23.160 --> 35:24.510
No, wait, wait, wait.
Wait, wait.

35:24.545 --> 35:25.515
Not yet.
Not yet.

35:25.550 --> 35:26.760
Why?
What's the matter?

35:27.340 --> 35:28.880
Nothing.
It's just that this...

35:30.710 --> 35:33.990
This will probably be the last chance
that I have to know the truth.

35:36.080 --> 35:36.715
I know you're...

35:36.750 --> 35:40.390
You're just doing your job here,
but sometimes it feels so real, you know?

35:41.460 --> 35:42.750
So, tell me.

35:44.550 --> 35:46.210
You and me.
Us.

35:47.410 --> 35:50.160
Our thing under the undercover thing.

35:51.390 --> 35:53.000
Is this ever going anywhere?

36:02.850 --> 36:04.120
I'm sorry, chuck.

36:08.000 --> 36:08.970
No.

36:16.780 --> 36:17.490
Got it...

36:19.650 --> 36:21.450
Got it.
Thank you for being host.

36:23.940 --> 36:25.970
Even though I guess you don't
really have a choice in the matter.

36:34.280 --> 36:35.380
Not bad.

36:40.740 --> 36:44.560
We received the codes and now our
weapons sites are more secure than ever.

36:44.595 --> 36:46.497
Congratulations on a job well done.

36:46.532 --> 36:48.400
Trying to have sex with my wife?

36:48.435 --> 36:50.730
I'm going to kick your ass.

36:56.210 --> 36:57.730
Okay, Morgan Grimes.

36:58.840 --> 37:02.090
You mess with the bull,
you get the horns.

37:09.530 --> 37:12.520
Major Casey, who've infiltrated the
Home Theatre Room?

37:14.660 --> 37:17.910
I... I... I see nothing out of
the ordinary here.

37:17.945 --> 37:19.385
Carry on, Bartowski.

37:19.420 --> 37:21.205
Stay right where you are.

37:21.240 --> 37:23.600
Chuck: wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.
What are you goin to do with him?

37:24.380 --> 37:25.540
We'll take care of it.

37:26.310 --> 37:28.350
Oh, you're good, tang, very good.

37:28.385 --> 37:29.020
I am?

37:29.430 --> 37:30.585
- Oh, of course,
- you are.

37:30.620 --> 37:33.900
I know you've been onto us for a while now,
but you nailed us this time.

37:33.935 --> 37:34.855
I... I did?

37:34.890 --> 37:35.640
Course, you did.

37:35.970 --> 37:38.700
I know you've always known that Sarah
and I worked undercover for the government.

37:39.110 --> 37:39.715
I knew it!

37:39.750 --> 37:42.410
I knew Bartowski couldn't bag
anyone as hot as Blondie.

37:42.445 --> 37:43.610
Oh, never mind Bartowski.

37:43.645 --> 37:44.810
He's small potatoes.

37:45.170 --> 37:46.810
Just the pawn we used to lure you here.

37:46.845 --> 37:47.987
I'm the big potato?

37:48.022 --> 37:49.130
You're the big potato.

37:50.050 --> 37:54.270
We're requesting you relocate to Oahu and await further
instructions on how to aid your country from there.

37:54.960 --> 37:56.490
- I'm going to be a spy?
- No.

37:57.610 --> 37:59.230
I would give a name to it.

38:05.330 --> 38:06.600
Leave the buy more.

38:07.150 --> 38:08.485
I never thought this
day would come.

38:08.520 --> 38:12.100
Don't know what it is about this place,
but it gets under your skin.

38:12.135 --> 38:12.980
Yeah.

38:15.130 --> 38:18.110
Proud to serve my country in
any way I can, sir.

38:25.610 --> 38:27.340
Hey, big me,
you wanted to see me?

38:27.780 --> 38:29.630
Thanks for your
help with Harry tang's wife.

38:29.665 --> 38:30.585
Did me a huge favor.

38:30.620 --> 38:32.610
Yeah, well, just doing my job there, sir.

38:32.645 --> 38:33.395
Oh, and grimes?

38:33.430 --> 38:36.730
Uh-huh change the shipping address
on tang's plasma delivery.

38:36.765 --> 38:38.200
Send it to their new place in Oahu.

38:39.110 --> 38:39.970
Oahu?

38:40.570 --> 38:41.980
Tang got himself a...

38:42.620 --> 38:43.945
Taste of the sweet life.

38:43.980 --> 38:46.070
Manager of some pineapple factory.

38:47.120 --> 38:48.390
Wait.
So, we're free?

38:49.390 --> 38:50.295
No more Harry tang?

38:50.330 --> 38:52.565
- Guess I’m not the only one glad to see him go.
- No.

38:52.600 --> 38:56.655
Know he can be tough, but use your
discretion with this information.

38:56.690 --> 39:00.300
I got so many secrets crammed in here,
fire marshal wants to shut it down.

39:01.980 --> 39:05.820
Had no choice but to give Harry tang the
assistant manager position.

39:07.320 --> 39:09.770
Felt so damned guilty about...

39:10.720 --> 39:13.260
Diddling his wife for the
past six months.

39:14.300 --> 39:18.260
No, I will not miss the man at all,

39:19.910 --> 39:24.970
but I will forever dream
about the lady tang.

40:03.360 --> 40:04.725
oh, hey. I...

40:04.760 --> 40:06.330
Didn't know you were coming by.

40:11.770 --> 40:14.605
Sarah, you know when you think
you're going to die,

40:14.640 --> 40:18.650
and your whole life is supposed
to flash in front of you?

40:18.970 --> 40:21.670
That didn't exactly happen
for me yesterday.

40:21.705 --> 40:25.520
In fact, mostly it was just a list...

40:26.060 --> 40:26.870
That I saw.

40:27.230 --> 40:32.190
A list of stuff that I haven't done and
things that I haven't had a chance to say.

40:32.510 --> 40:33.340
So today...

40:36.340 --> 40:38.500
Today, I want to start
crossing things off of my list.

40:39.800 --> 40:42.870
And this is the first thing that
I promised myself that I’d do.

40:50.270 --> 40:51.890
We need to break up.

40:53.940 --> 40:54.765
What?

40:54.800 --> 40:58.570
You know, you know, like, fake-fake
break up our pretend relationship.

41:03.860 --> 41:06.030
I just can't do this anymore,
you know?

41:07.500 --> 41:12.530
The longer we go, the longer we keep trying to fool
people into believing that we're a real couple...

41:14.880 --> 41:19.800
The person I keep fooling
the most is me.

41:41.570 --> 41:42.055
Yeah.

41:42.090 --> 41:43.120
I meant to ask you.

41:43.860 --> 41:46.710
When you were affected, did you say
anything to compromise yourself?

41:46.745 --> 41:47.730
Uh... No.

41:49.810 --> 41:53.350
But if I hadn't been trained to withstand
pentathol, I might have.
