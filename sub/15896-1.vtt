Based on the true events
In the recorded history of Korea

00:49.180 --> 00:51.171
PRESENTED BY LOTTE ENTERTAINMENT

01:01.192 --> 01:04.161
A SOOFILM PRODUCTION

01:05.230 --> 01:07.255
A MIN KYU-DONG FILM

01:10.235 --> 01:12.804
1505 A.D. King Yeonsan-gun ordered
'Beauty Recruit Officers'

01:12.804 --> 01:15.204
to bring him over 10,000 women
for his carnal desires,

01:15.273 --> 01:17.509
which led to widespread anger
among the populace.

01:17.509 --> 01:19.238
- ANNALS OF THE JOSEON DYNASTY-

01:21.212 --> 01:25.239
To understand how
a king ruined his nation,

01:26.284 --> 01:29.185
hear my tale.

01:30.288 --> 01:34.224
It is the 10th year of his rule.

01:35.260 --> 01:38.195
On the night of Blood Moon,

01:39.197 --> 01:43.156
two men met the mother of
deposed Queen Yoon.

01:44.235 --> 01:52.199
Through them the king obtained

01:53.211 --> 01:55.236
a blood stained woman's clothing.

01:56.214 --> 01:59.206
ls this really what
my mother was wearing

02:01.219 --> 02:03.288
when she was killed?

02:03.288 --> 02:04.322
Your Highness!

02:04.322 --> 02:08.315
The late king wanted to
keep this a secret,

02:08.994 --> 02:11.963
so I desired to
take this to my grave...

02:11.963 --> 02:14.227
So why bring it now?

02:14.332 --> 02:19.269
An unknown party
hired an assassin to steal it!

02:19.337 --> 02:21.006
By whom?

02:21.006 --> 02:25.306
Half of the court tried to
dethrone the late Queen,

02:25.977 --> 02:29.276
so we do not know
who's behind the plot.

02:30.148 --> 02:34.319
But we could not ignore
where this may lead to.

02:34.319 --> 02:36.287
Who'd have thought,

02:36.354 --> 02:45.262
a piece of clothing would
result in a blood bath.

02:46.297 --> 02:50.256
Where did
the enraged king first visit?

02:50.335 --> 02:53.338
He killed his father's
2 resentful concubines

02:53.338 --> 02:56.239
with his bare hands,

02:56.307 --> 02:58.298
and iron mace.

02:59.310 --> 03:04.338
Their bodies were torn up
and scattered in the mountain.

03:06.384 --> 03:12.345
He also killed his grandmother
for slandering his mother,

03:13.124 --> 03:16.361
and those who spread
defaming rumors,

03:16.361 --> 03:18.396
supporters of dethronement,

03:18.396 --> 03:22.033
maids who transported the poison,

03:22.033 --> 03:24.399
they were all mercilessly killed

03:25.370 --> 03:30.307
by poison, decapitation,

03:30.375 --> 03:33.367
and dismemberment into pieces.

03:34.379 --> 03:37.280
Traitors' tombstones were destroyed,

03:37.348 --> 03:40.283
their remains dug up

03:40.385 --> 03:43.377
and smashed to smithereens,

03:44.389 --> 03:50.328
eventually ending up as
dust in the air.

03:50.395 --> 03:59.360
Over 200 remains were
fed to the pigs.

04:01.372 --> 04:04.364
This killing spree
became known as

04:04.442 --> 04:07.377
the Second Literati Purge.

04:08.413 --> 04:13.407
However, two men never stopped
laughing during the purge:

04:14.452 --> 04:17.387
Minister IM Soong-jae,

04:17.454 --> 04:20.390
and his father IM Sa-hong.

04:20.492 --> 04:24.428
They were
the most treacherous men alive.

04:24.996 --> 04:28.432
What goes around
comes around,

04:29.434 --> 04:38.365
your bone dust
may fly in the wind one day...

04:38.443 --> 04:43.403
THE TREACHEROUS

04:51.456 --> 04:54.192
Your Highness, we can't...

04:54.192 --> 04:56.387
Don't move!
I'm almost done.

04:57.462 --> 05:01.398
This brush won't let go
once in my hand.

05:01.466 --> 05:03.457
Minister!

05:03.535 --> 05:05.469
Yes, Highness.

05:05.537 --> 05:10.241
I believe all vicious weeds
have been uprooted.

05:10.241 --> 05:16.476
Your resolve to eliminate them
has reached the heavens.

05:17.482 --> 05:20.474
Lt wasn't my resolve alone,
your efforts paid off.

05:21.519 --> 05:23.453
All done.

05:24.489 --> 05:25.478
Come in!

05:35.500 --> 05:36.524
Please sit.

05:39.537 --> 05:43.473
Lt is quite a sight.

05:43.541 --> 05:47.477
I just love this silver knife.

05:47.545 --> 05:52.505
With the will of the taker against
the defender of chastity,

05:53.484 --> 05:57.420
two innate desires in one...

05:58.122 --> 05:59.487
It is simply magnificent.

06:00.191 --> 06:02.227
I am honored, Your Highness.

06:02.227 --> 06:06.596
I must reward you two
for your continuous sacrifices.

06:08.333 --> 06:10.528
Hope you like it.

06:12.570 --> 06:16.541
Your grief over the recent affairs

06:16.541 --> 06:19.533
is clearly expressed.

06:20.612 --> 06:23.513
What say you?

06:24.315 --> 06:28.513
Vivid sensuality is enough
to arouse one's lust,

06:29.287 --> 06:33.553
but their false expression
prevent it from reaching grace.

06:33.625 --> 06:36.594
Then I must throw this out.

06:37.161 --> 06:40.528
There is a way to elevate it.

06:40.598 --> 06:42.532
IM

06:45.603 --> 06:47.138
IM Soong-jae

06:47.138 --> 06:51.576
By claiming it as my own,
it'll not taint your reputation,

06:51.576 --> 06:57.515
and it is a masterpiece
considering my limited talent.

06:59.550 --> 07:01.484
Bullshit!

07:04.656 --> 07:07.557
You are something!

07:08.626 --> 07:11.595
Did the king really
bestow you this?

07:11.663 --> 07:14.598
Don't you see my name on it?

07:14.666 --> 07:18.568
Now, whoever
mimics this pose the best,

07:18.670 --> 07:22.606
will be awarded with
this golden toad.

07:27.679 --> 07:28.646
My Lord.

07:29.380 --> 07:32.645
We only have
one new addition today.

07:35.253 --> 07:38.423
ls she not the one?

07:38.423 --> 07:40.618
If you give me that drawing,

07:41.192 --> 07:43.094
I'll show you something better.

07:43.094 --> 07:44.584
What?

07:44.662 --> 07:48.621
I heard you check
all the new girls.

07:50.635 --> 07:53.671
Who could you be looking for?

07:53.671 --> 07:58.574
I'm not sure, but you are
definitely not the one.

08:02.680 --> 08:06.673
I heard you're the king's
most trusted confidant.

08:06.751 --> 08:08.651
However,

08:08.720 --> 08:11.689
tonight, you are my king.

08:13.758 --> 08:17.694
Then I shall show you
how a king jests.

08:19.430 --> 08:22.661
For every jar I empty,
take off an article.

08:22.734 --> 08:25.703
If I pass out
before you're naked,

08:26.371 --> 08:30.671
in addition to the drawing,
I'll bring you into the palace.

08:30.742 --> 08:35.645
But if I win,
you'll walk the streets naked.

08:35.746 --> 08:38.648
- Will you accept?
- Of course.

09:42.780 --> 09:44.748
Hurry up.

09:48.753 --> 09:49.742
Good.

09:59.764 --> 10:01.755
That was the final drink.

10:05.803 --> 10:09.739
- My Lord...
- Get on with it!

10:10.808 --> 10:12.298
My Lord!

10:16.747 --> 10:17.714
Please spare me!

10:17.782 --> 10:21.786
Spare you?
It was merely a jest!

10:21.786 --> 10:24.687
I overstepped...

10:25.756 --> 10:29.692
You sly devious whore!

10:29.827 --> 10:33.197
- Strip all the way!
- What's going on?

10:33.197 --> 10:34.799
Stop this at once!

10:34.799 --> 10:37.802
The king's gift is an heirloom!

10:37.802 --> 10:40.771
You must be joking.

10:41.239 --> 10:43.764
That lewd drawing
as an heirloom?

10:44.475 --> 10:46.777
You ungrateful bastard!

10:46.777 --> 10:47.766
How dare you!

10:49.780 --> 10:52.749
Don't you know
I got you reinstated?

10:55.319 --> 10:56.911
Everyone out!
At once!

10:58.356 --> 11:02.759
After these two men
shook up the country,

11:02.827 --> 11:07.787
streets were filled with criticisms.

11:07.865 --> 11:13.604
The king left official duties behind
for carnal desires,

11:13.604 --> 11:19.804
royal advices from
his ministers fell on deaf ears.

11:20.378 --> 11:25.816
He turned a city
into a hunting ground...

11:27.885 --> 11:32.845
The hunt for his populace
or animals has begun!

11:37.461 --> 11:42.797
As his tyranny peaked,
this nation faced a crisis.

11:43.868 --> 11:48.805
'We must call for an uprising,

11:48.873 --> 11:52.809
that thrones a fair king
to replace the old!'

11:57.848 --> 12:00.840
Today's hunt is
starting off with a bang.

12:01.819 --> 12:02.911
Let's go!

12:03.621 --> 12:04.918
No need for tears.

12:05.523 --> 12:08.856
Your life will change
if he asks for you.

12:08.960 --> 12:10.860
Giddyup!

12:13.598 --> 12:17.864
It's been a while since
us brothers went on a hunt.

12:17.935 --> 12:20.836
Indeed, Your Highness.

12:21.439 --> 12:24.642
Have you walked the streets
under a disguise lately?

12:24.642 --> 12:26.510
Well, yes.

12:26.510 --> 12:29.877
If I am preoccupied with
official duties,

12:29.947 --> 12:33.849
it is your duty to keep an ear
on the populace on my behalf.

12:33.918 --> 12:34.907
Yes.

12:37.955 --> 12:41.891
Or are you holding
something back?

12:42.893 --> 12:44.861
What do you mean?

12:55.940 --> 12:59.876
I am simply jesting!

13:01.646 --> 13:06.984
You Highness, how about
a friendly race?

13:06.984 --> 13:09.282
Yes, that'd be fun!

13:09.954 --> 13:10.943
Minister PARK!

13:11.956 --> 13:12.923
Yes, Your Highness!

13:16.961 --> 13:17.985
So...

13:18.963 --> 13:20.954
What should we bet?

13:21.966 --> 13:25.002
I have nothing worthy to bet,
Your Highness.

13:25.002 --> 13:26.804
You have your life.

13:26.804 --> 13:29.272
Highness, you jest.

13:29.707 --> 13:31.008
Don't worry.

13:31.008 --> 13:35.945
Many will offer their necks
in your stead.

13:37.014 --> 13:42.953
How about we test
their loyalty to you?

14:57.027 --> 14:58.016
Your Highness!

15:07.104 --> 15:09.072
Get the royal physician!

15:10.074 --> 15:11.098
Physician! Physician!

15:16.147 --> 15:22.017
I order you to exterminate storks
from our land at once.

15:22.119 --> 15:24.121
Do you understand?

15:24.121 --> 15:26.089
Yes, Your Highness!

15:28.092 --> 15:34.088
The king began to suffer from
apparitions and insomnia,

15:34.165 --> 15:41.071
it was said that this was
due to heavy blood loss.

15:41.138 --> 15:46.098
It was unlike of Soong-jae
to miss this chance.

15:47.077 --> 15:48.101
Your Highness.

15:49.113 --> 15:51.104
How do you feel?

15:52.149 --> 15:56.051
What do you think
of the sun?

15:57.721 --> 16:03.091
It is brilliantly radiant,
and all encompassing...

16:04.161 --> 16:06.152
Just like Your Highness.

16:06.230 --> 16:13.136
Then, like the sun,
do I...

16:14.138 --> 16:17.130
encompass all of Joseon?

16:17.208 --> 16:22.168
If you grace women of Joseon
with your light,

16:23.180 --> 16:27.184
it will rid of their shadows
and cure Your Highness.

16:27.184 --> 16:32.121
What nonsense,
when His Highness is ill.

16:33.190 --> 16:38.150
There is no shame in
pursuing carnal desires.

16:39.163 --> 16:44.123
I'll bring you a millennium of
pleasures for one night!

16:53.611 --> 16:54.441
My baby.

16:55.145 --> 17:00.082
It is my duty to select
the girls for the king.

17:00.217 --> 17:05.176
I know my baby's taste
the best.

17:05.955 --> 17:09.186
I will handpick the girls
for my baby's liking,

17:09.260 --> 17:11.228
so why don't you allow me...

17:11.428 --> 17:14.226
I have plans,

17:14.298 --> 17:20.167
so set your worries aside,
and help me sleep.

17:21.204 --> 17:22.194
What plans?

17:23.240 --> 17:27.175
Your Highness,
Minister IM has arrived.

17:28.212 --> 17:29.236
Let him in!

17:37.254 --> 17:40.223
Just in time,
I've been curious.

17:40.291 --> 17:43.192
Here is the list of
candidates.

17:44.194 --> 17:48.221
They say your life flashes
before you when facing death.

17:48.899 --> 17:53.199
Do you know what I saw
at that moment?

17:53.270 --> 17:57.241
I saw the look of those
who wished for my death.

17:57.241 --> 18:02.178
I cannot forget
the anticipation on their faces.

18:03.280 --> 18:07.307
They'll hide their teeth
and wait for their time.

18:07.818 --> 18:11.310
If their teeth are hidden
behind their lips,

18:12.289 --> 18:16.225
why not sew them shut
for good?

18:17.361 --> 18:23.266
I've been holding banquets
despite difficult circumstances,

18:24.335 --> 18:29.272
to seek those who could
bear me an heir.

18:29.340 --> 18:35.279
I realized I should have
searched farther.

18:36.280 --> 18:41.274
Ergo, I order a nationwide
beauty recruiting.

18:41.885 --> 18:47.323
They'll be called 'comforters',
and live up to that name.

18:47.891 --> 18:51.224
Therefore, Minister IM Soong-jae,

18:51.295 --> 18:53.320
and Minister of Defense IM Sa-hong

18:53.831 --> 18:58.291
are given full royal authority
as 'Beauty Recruit Officers'!

19:00.304 --> 19:04.331
We are eternally grateful,
Your Highness.

19:07.411 --> 19:09.379
It's a sunny place

19:09.880 --> 19:14.151
and a prime spot
to watch the sunset.

19:14.151 --> 19:19.783
I was saving it for a gazebo,
but I hope you like it.

19:19.857 --> 19:23.360
It's good enough for a palace!

19:23.360 --> 19:25.328
Palace? Nice!

19:29.400 --> 19:32.369
How would we solicit
to change king's orders?

19:32.870 --> 19:35.304
We cannot accept this.

19:39.410 --> 19:40.411
Sir...

19:40.411 --> 19:43.312
- Out of my way!
- Minister YU...

19:43.414 --> 19:47.282
Consort JANG must be desperate.

19:47.718 --> 19:50.346
But you didn't
need to be so cold.

19:50.421 --> 19:53.390
We cannot ignore her.

19:54.425 --> 19:59.362
Thought the candidates
were chosen at random?

20:04.368 --> 20:09.362
Those who looked down on us
will beg for their lives.

20:10.407 --> 20:15.367
The strong gets to pick,
the weak gets picked.

20:16.346 --> 20:17.381
One more drink, please?

20:17.381 --> 20:20.350
- Come here, bitch!
- Minister PARK, it's not our room!

20:20.417 --> 20:25.422
I didn't realize the loyal subjects

20:25.422 --> 20:30.359
who work tirelessly
for the king's virility were here.

20:31.395 --> 20:33.363
Excuse me.

20:36.900 --> 20:41.337
As if all your scheming
and pimping weren't enough,

20:41.405 --> 20:46.604
now you'll scrounge
every virgin for his pleasure?

20:47.377 --> 20:49.346
Drink quietly.

20:49.346 --> 20:50.335
Soong-jae.

20:51.148 --> 20:53.383
Are you so desperate for power?

20:53.383 --> 20:57.342
ls it today?
Your sister's death anniversary.

20:59.389 --> 21:04.428
When the king frequented her room,
I was often by his side.

21:04.428 --> 21:08.387
What I heard weren't screams,
but moans.

21:08.465 --> 21:09.800
So why the suicide?

21:09.800 --> 21:11.427
IM Soong-jae!

21:11.802 --> 21:13.429
How does it feel!

21:13.971 --> 21:17.474
To know that
you bow down to the man

21:17.474 --> 21:21.376
who raped your sister?

21:24.448 --> 21:26.439
May I have another?

21:37.494 --> 21:41.624
Are you confident that
you can serve the king?

21:42.065 --> 21:45.469
I have experienced
men of all kinds,

21:45.469 --> 21:49.405
from nobles, farmers, butchers,
to even thugs.

21:49.473 --> 21:51.441
Any man with balls intact,

21:52.442 --> 21:54.444
I can wrap him in my skirt

21:54.444 --> 21:56.378
and suck his soul out.

21:56.446 --> 21:59.483
How dare you compare
the king to peasants!

21:59.483 --> 22:01.451
But isn't the king

22:02.452 --> 22:04.221
also a man?

22:04.221 --> 22:08.453
Overconfidence aside,
you'll do.

22:08.525 --> 22:11.460
Glad that she's to your liking.

22:11.528 --> 22:15.464
I cannot tolerate
the two 'lM's anymore.

22:15.532 --> 22:18.001
I must regain my power,

22:18.001 --> 22:20.469
so take special care,
Minister YU!

22:27.177 --> 22:28.439
Red!

22:28.545 --> 22:30.513
It's red!

22:31.181 --> 22:35.481
One word out of the king,
the red flag is raised.

22:36.286 --> 22:41.485
Show yourself!
Show yourself to me!

22:42.526 --> 22:47.429
The one who'll comfort the king
will become Comforters!

22:47.531 --> 22:50.466
The one who'll cleanse him,

22:50.567 --> 22:53.468
will be the Consort!

22:54.538 --> 22:56.506
It's not a formal court affair.

22:57.140 --> 23:02.510
So it won't be guaranteed
whether the king will grace her.

23:03.313 --> 23:08.546
But ultimately she'll serve the king.

23:09.519 --> 23:10.543
Father!

23:12.556 --> 23:13.545
Let me go!

23:14.558 --> 23:15.547
Honey!

23:16.193 --> 23:22.530
Daughters, wives, mistresses
were all requisitioned...

23:23.300 --> 23:27.571
Wearing red uniform
and taking girls away,

23:27.571 --> 23:29.562
they were the grim reapers,

23:30.207 --> 23:34.576
and not a single woman
was spotted on the street.

23:35.579 --> 23:42.542
There are more than
one way to find girls!

23:46.590 --> 23:48.490
Oh no!

23:48.558 --> 23:49.582
Your Majesty!

23:50.527 --> 23:54.598
This young lady is destined to
become a queen!

23:54.598 --> 23:55.599
Please stop.

23:55.599 --> 23:57.590
Your Majesty!

23:58.602 --> 24:00.237
Dammit.

24:00.237 --> 24:02.535
- Come with us!
- Wait! Hold on!

24:09.646 --> 24:12.581
So much chaos
and shady deals.

24:13.617 --> 24:17.654
One could not watch on
without tearing up.

24:17.654 --> 24:18.643
Virgin!

24:19.623 --> 24:24.560
Virgins were marked red,
while others blue.

24:25.595 --> 24:28.587
The royal artist painted
day and night,

24:28.665 --> 24:33.602
turning teary faces
into happy ones.

24:35.639 --> 24:39.598
I think we have enough.

24:40.644 --> 24:45.638
But the king will want someone
truly unique.

24:47.417 --> 24:50.648
They are not enough
to win against the Consort.

24:51.254 --> 24:52.653
If so...

24:53.690 --> 24:56.660
there's one last place to visit.

24:56.660 --> 24:59.595
NEUNGJU

25:00.630 --> 25:01.619
Enough!

25:08.672 --> 25:09.696
Listen here.

25:10.707 --> 25:14.745
Debt must be repaid with money,
what is this nonsense?

25:14.745 --> 25:20.517
You moved up the deadline,
this was all I could muster.

25:20.517 --> 25:25.682
So, didn't I say
I'll void your debt

25:25.756 --> 25:28.657
for a drink
with your daughter.

25:28.725 --> 25:31.660
Do you not understand?

25:32.696 --> 25:36.655
I'll make her an orphan

25:36.733 --> 25:38.701
and take her!

25:42.739 --> 25:45.375
Who's this?

25:45.375 --> 25:47.711
You haven't changed at all.

25:47.711 --> 25:50.680
Your sharp tongue is
still the same.

25:50.747 --> 25:52.681
Come in.

25:53.683 --> 25:54.650
Come.

25:54.718 --> 25:57.050
Father! Father!

25:57.721 --> 25:59.621
Are you all right?

26:03.827 --> 26:07.764
I heard you and my father
were old friends.

26:07.764 --> 26:09.732
We were indeed.

26:09.800 --> 26:14.737
Time travels faster
than an arrow.

26:14.805 --> 26:19.176
I also heard you promised
to achieve greatness together!

26:19.176 --> 26:21.178
Did we?

26:21.178 --> 26:25.740
Well, it became difficult
since my father was dismissed.

26:25.816 --> 26:32.422
You could've prevented
his dismissal.

26:32.422 --> 26:36.756
But instead,
you spoke ill of him!

26:38.829 --> 26:40.764
Checkmate.

26:40.764 --> 26:42.698
Bad move.

26:42.766 --> 26:44.468
Mind if I take back?

26:44.468 --> 26:46.265
Not at all!

26:47.771 --> 26:49.762
Not a problem at all.

26:52.809 --> 26:57.769
Look, I couldn't help him
back then,

26:58.448 --> 27:02.714
since I was too weak
to stand against the court.

27:02.786 --> 27:04.777
There was no malice.

27:04.855 --> 27:10.851
Please forgive me...
Take my fortune!

27:11.862 --> 27:19.769
Just look at her,
she's my only daughter!

27:24.841 --> 27:26.809
Minister, I have a lover!

27:26.877 --> 27:31.780
A palanquin will come for her,
so have her ready.

27:35.852 --> 27:38.844
Did you hear?
Even Lord JO got raided.

27:39.890 --> 27:43.660
Those scouts are
no better than pirates.

27:43.660 --> 27:46.663
They already took more than
ten thousand girls!

27:46.663 --> 27:47.823
It's insane!

27:48.832 --> 27:51.868
If I ever see
one of those scouts,

27:51.868 --> 27:54.803
I'll skin them alive!

27:55.839 --> 27:59.832
Why aren't I recruited?
I'm the fairest.

28:00.810 --> 28:03.947
Shit, your face provokes
violence in men.

28:03.947 --> 28:07.815
Say what?
You asshole!

28:08.852 --> 28:10.843
Leaving already?

28:10.921 --> 28:12.821
They'll begin soon.

28:12.889 --> 28:13.890
Begin what?

28:13.890 --> 28:16.882
Aren't you here for the show?

28:30.941 --> 28:35.878
The world is in disarray,
people are driven into mountains,

28:35.946 --> 28:40.849
and the hunger has forced them
to eat each other.

28:41.885 --> 28:47.846
The enraged mountain god
sent a tiger!

28:49.626 --> 28:53.930
With the god's order,
it came to renounce the world,

28:53.930 --> 28:58.833
but could not find any
guilty men.

28:58.902 --> 29:01.871
Why should people be guilty
of poverty?

29:01.938 --> 29:06.898
Corrupt officials behind high walls
are the guilty ones.

29:06.977 --> 29:08.011
They deserve to die!

29:08.011 --> 29:12.948
When the tiger could not
climb over the high wall,

29:13.583 --> 29:18.885
it decided to become flesh
and blood of the peasants,

29:18.989 --> 29:25.918
and help wreak havoc
on the corrupted.

29:31.968 --> 29:33.959
He saw her briefly.

29:34.938 --> 29:37.964
Wide forehead,
eyebrows like weeping willow,

29:38.975 --> 29:42.968
clear peacock eyes,
sharp nose,

29:43.980 --> 29:46.972
and lips like peach skin...

29:47.984 --> 29:51.943
He knew he had found the one!

29:52.989 --> 29:55.958
But... she was a meager butcher.

29:56.026 --> 29:57.960
A butcher!

30:55.785 --> 30:56.945
Look here!

30:58.021 --> 30:59.723
May I help you?

30:59.723 --> 31:00.985
Could you remove your hat?

31:01.491 --> 31:04.027
It's no face for a noble.

31:04.027 --> 31:05.016
Hey! It's him.

31:05.995 --> 31:08.020
Fitting your title
as the women hunter!

31:08.098 --> 31:11.067
Going after a girl
like a dog in heat!

31:11.067 --> 31:14.002
How dare you
talk to a noble like that!

31:14.070 --> 31:17.039
I got no business
with you two, so get lost.

31:18.007 --> 31:18.974
Let's go.

31:22.078 --> 31:25.047
Who hired you?

31:25.782 --> 31:26.976
Hire me?

31:27.050 --> 31:28.051
You got it wrong.

31:28.051 --> 31:31.054
I volunteer myself
to kick the shit out of you!

31:31.054 --> 31:32.043
- Agree?
- Sure.

31:46.069 --> 31:49.004
I got him good!

32:00.049 --> 32:01.016
You bitch!

32:03.019 --> 32:04.043
You bastard!

32:27.744 --> 32:30.042
Feeling better, sir?

32:30.146 --> 32:31.113
Are you hurt?

32:31.648 --> 32:33.081
It's nothing.

32:33.149 --> 32:37.017
Why did you follow me?

32:39.122 --> 32:43.058
I once knew a sword dancer.

32:44.060 --> 32:48.087
She had a unique
hand gesture and steps.

32:49.132 --> 32:52.067
Where did you learn
that dance?

32:52.802 --> 32:56.101
It came to me
while working as a butcher.

32:56.172 --> 32:59.073
Not from a teacher.

33:01.110 --> 33:02.099
I see.

33:04.214 --> 33:07.149
Sir, I have a favor to ask.

33:07.784 --> 33:09.149
Could you...

33:09.219 --> 33:11.153
recruit me?

33:14.224 --> 33:16.124
I'll pretend
I didn't hear that.

33:16.192 --> 33:19.896
ls it because my hands reek
of animal blood?

33:19.896 --> 33:21.197
At least you know.

33:21.197 --> 33:22.186
But sir!

33:23.166 --> 33:26.101
My father has a large debt.

33:26.202 --> 33:27.170
So please...

33:27.170 --> 33:28.137
Let go.

33:30.907 --> 33:32.775
I will even...

33:32.775 --> 33:35.141
offer myself to you.

33:43.219 --> 33:46.086
Come on out!

34:04.841 --> 34:07.173
Show your face!

34:10.246 --> 34:14.181
I am Jung-hwa,
Lord JO's daughter.

34:47.850 --> 34:49.018
I'm back, father.

34:49.018 --> 34:50.212
Good work.

34:58.861 --> 35:01.159
- Let's go inside.
- Yes.

35:07.337 --> 35:08.304
Over there!

35:08.838 --> 35:10.305
What are you doing?

35:23.319 --> 35:27.255
Nothing wrong with
getting a little taste.

35:27.357 --> 35:29.291
Hold still!

35:34.897 --> 35:36.296
Do you wish to die?

35:36.799 --> 35:39.290
She's a property of the king.

35:40.269 --> 35:41.304
Spare me, sir!

35:41.304 --> 35:43.238
Your father allowed it...

35:43.306 --> 35:46.241
- You lie!
- It's true.

35:47.877 --> 35:50.277
Was this your plan
all along?

35:50.346 --> 35:56.251
She'll be defiled at the palace,
it won't make a difference.

35:57.286 --> 36:00.278
She's just paying for
her father's crimes.

36:00.890 --> 36:05.350
Will you give up your power
over petty grudge?

36:06.129 --> 36:09.326
Makhana lotus flower
blooms once a century.

36:09.432 --> 36:12.368
She is the lotus I found!

36:12.368 --> 36:16.361
It's too early to know
if she'll bloom or wither.

36:18.408 --> 36:23.379
The path towards the king
won't be so smooth.

36:23.379 --> 36:25.313
I was just startled.

36:25.381 --> 36:30.318
A lowly butcher personating
a noble's daughter...

36:31.387 --> 36:33.355
What are you really after?

36:34.123 --> 36:39.117
Repaying my father's debt,
that's all.

36:40.096 --> 36:44.396
You chose to walk this path,
let's see how long you last.

36:53.376 --> 36:54.308
Your Highness!

36:54.377 --> 36:58.313
- Minister PARK reporting...
- Who dares to interrupt!

37:11.928 --> 37:14.362
- Are they here?
- Yes, Your Highness.

37:32.448 --> 37:34.678
Minister IM Sa-hong.

37:34.917 --> 37:37.385
Minister IM Soong-jae.

37:37.987 --> 37:41.388
We returned from our duties...

37:43.493 --> 37:45.428
Okay! Good!

37:45.428 --> 37:46.452
I've waited so long!

37:46.896 --> 37:49.660
Good, raise your heads!

37:49.899 --> 37:50.888
Now!

37:51.434 --> 37:54.403
You'll eat Joseon's
greatest delicacies

37:54.470 --> 37:57.439
on gold plates
to your heart's content.

37:57.974 --> 38:01.637
You'll wear clothes of
silk and satin,

38:02.445 --> 38:08.451
we'll hold banquets on the river,
bathe in the valley,

38:08.451 --> 38:13.445
hunt tigers together,
and make love every day...

38:14.524 --> 38:18.194
However, if you miss
your husband or lover,

38:18.194 --> 38:20.363
or even think about escaping,

38:20.363 --> 38:22.490
I'll behead you on the spot!

38:28.504 --> 38:34.500
All right! I'll take you
to our playground!

38:36.479 --> 38:37.503
Behold!

38:42.518 --> 38:46.489
Let me introduce your peers!

38:46.489 --> 38:50.391
This university is intended
to educate...

38:50.459 --> 38:56.532
Even Confucius said
if you disregard interaction,

38:56.532 --> 39:02.164
you can't expect
true growth, right?

39:02.972 --> 39:07.610
There are strict code of conduct
between men and women.

39:07.610 --> 39:11.478
I even brought your wife here.

39:11.581 --> 39:13.572
So don't be so harsh.

39:14.550 --> 39:17.314
How's our baby?

39:17.587 --> 39:21.546
I found a wet nurse,
so don't worry.

39:26.562 --> 39:30.032
Until these comforters
become consorts,

39:30.032 --> 39:32.335
they'll reside here,

39:32.335 --> 39:37.500
and lower comforters will be
disciplined at nearby temples!

39:37.573 --> 39:39.564
Yes, Your Highness!

39:43.312 --> 39:46.549
This is unbearable.

39:46.549 --> 39:51.680
Turning universities and temples
into comforter training camps!

39:52.121 --> 39:55.557
This has gone too far
and too long.

39:56.125 --> 39:58.559
How long must we wait?

39:59.195 --> 40:02.494
Who must we induct?

40:02.565 --> 40:07.559
Who else?
Prince Jinseong, of course.

40:10.606 --> 40:12.574
Our time will come.

40:13.609 --> 40:17.511
People's resentment is
getting deeper.

40:21.584 --> 40:23.518
Wake up!

40:24.520 --> 40:27.512
Move faster!
Hurry!

40:27.590 --> 40:30.259
What makes an ideal woman?

40:30.259 --> 40:34.563
Large mouth and clean teeth
that can envelop a manhood,

40:34.563 --> 40:38.556
long black hair like silk
and slender ankles.

40:39.201 --> 40:43.535
Satin-like skin
and warm body temperature.

40:43.639 --> 40:48.542
Full buttocks and thin bones!

40:50.346 --> 40:54.510
And what makes
a desirable vagina?

40:55.151 --> 40:58.587
First, the opening should be
near the front.

40:58.587 --> 41:03.581
Second, less pubic hair is best,
and must be thin and fair.

41:04.226 --> 41:08.629
Third, it must always be
warm and moist.

41:10.199 --> 41:13.635
When it comes to size,
it should be

41:14.303 --> 41:20.343
just big enough
to fit the king's manhood.

41:20.343 --> 41:24.575
Sex positions all have
one principle:

41:24.647 --> 41:28.583
to achieve pure bliss
through proper contact.

41:28.651 --> 41:31.643
How do you consider yourself
for the ultimate contact?

41:32.621 --> 41:34.589
- Confucius said...
- With respect...

41:34.657 --> 41:38.593
Aren't we just wet holes
for the king to fuck?

41:40.629 --> 41:44.622
We're royal palace piss pots,
albeit the best kind.

41:45.234 --> 41:50.638
Capable of taking any loads
from men of all ages and sorts.

41:53.676 --> 41:55.610
We are like medicine.

41:55.678 --> 41:59.614
Using our body to heal another.

42:00.349 --> 42:02.579
That is the real contact.

42:03.652 --> 42:05.677
Very good!

42:05.755 --> 42:11.494
Whatever it may be,
nobody knows who among you

42:11.494 --> 42:14.622
will become consorts
or discarded as slaves.

42:14.730 --> 42:16.698
Contests and lectures will be held,

42:16.766 --> 42:19.701
so do your absolute best.

42:21.704 --> 42:24.673
Do you really believe
you're a medicine?

42:25.708 --> 42:28.677
I shall teach you
how to be one.

42:30.479 --> 42:33.482
How ridiculous,
how ridiculous...

42:33.482 --> 42:38.681
The king is a poet,
so learn the metaphors.

42:39.722 --> 42:41.690
He is a brilliant painter!

42:41.757 --> 42:45.659
Use your body
to express yourself.

42:47.696 --> 42:50.665
Pierce the moon with your toes!

42:50.733 --> 42:51.700
Higher!

42:52.701 --> 42:57.638
Raising your heels will develop
your pelvic muscles.

42:58.741 --> 43:01.710
Cleaning with unbent knees
stimulates the uterus,

43:01.710 --> 43:03.678
and tenderizes your inside.

43:04.346 --> 43:07.450
Mix sulfur, gemmifera roots,
cornus fruit, and cnidium,

43:07.450 --> 43:09.782
grind and sift them,
then insert it.

43:10.753 --> 43:14.314
It'll shrink your vagina
and make it more sensitive.

43:16.759 --> 43:21.753
Mix 3 spoons of sulfur in water
and wash your privates.

43:22.765 --> 43:25.501
It'll make it
like a young girl's.

43:25.501 --> 43:26.763
Who's there?

43:30.773 --> 43:32.707
Do not flinch!

43:32.775 --> 43:35.767
Feminine energy stems from
lower abdomen.

43:39.748 --> 43:43.741
After sensual Taoist trainings,

43:43.819 --> 43:46.754
only two remained!

43:47.223 --> 43:51.023
A butcher who hid her true self,

43:51.460 --> 43:55.760
and a concubine who was
filled with deep jealousy.

43:56.832 --> 44:02.737
Squeeze out the seeds
and don't spill a single drop.

44:10.846 --> 44:14.839
Testicles are sensitive,
only use tongue to stimulate.

44:29.431 --> 44:32.868
There are 6 intercourse guidelines.

44:32.868 --> 44:33.857
One.

44:34.803 --> 44:38.762
Like a wet cloth,
embrace him tightly.

44:38.841 --> 44:41.810
Two, uterus must be warm.

44:42.478 --> 44:45.936
Otherwise, there'll be
vaginal discharge.

44:47.483 --> 44:48.814
Three.

44:49.385 --> 44:55.756
Upon insertion,
tighten your vaginal walls

44:56.859 --> 44:58.759
Four.

44:59.328 --> 45:02.820
When on top,
gyrate your hips.

45:03.799 --> 45:04.857
Five.

45:04.934 --> 45:08.893
Moan seductively under him.

45:09.939 --> 45:11.873
Six.

45:12.942 --> 45:16.901
When you don't reach orgasm,
he may work too hard for it.

45:18.948 --> 45:22.816
If he ejaculates too early,
it could only mean trouble.

45:22.885 --> 45:24.876
- So you must climax hastily.
- It's all right.

45:25.087 --> 45:26.488
It's not all right!

45:26.488 --> 45:28.888
Do not forget these guidelines!

45:41.437 --> 45:45.874
With everyone in one place,

45:46.575 --> 45:48.944
it's like addressing
the entire nation.

45:48.944 --> 45:51.913
We're not worthy,
Your Highness.

45:52.548 --> 45:55.915
Pick a dish
and introduce yourself.

46:01.924 --> 46:05.917
I'm from deep valleys
of Milyang.

46:05.995 --> 46:09.988
Your southern accent will
charm us all!

46:10.666 --> 46:11.963
You're the Cutie.

46:12.635 --> 46:13.966
I am...

46:15.537 --> 46:18.741
Look at her!

46:18.741 --> 46:20.902
I'll call you the Wimp.

46:21.710 --> 46:24.907
The Elegant, the Beautiful,
the Skilled...

46:24.980 --> 46:27.949
The king inspected
everyone very carefully,

46:28.017 --> 46:31.180
but soon got bored of it,

46:31.353 --> 46:34.948
and didn't even bother anymore.

46:38.994 --> 46:40.928
That's her.

46:52.975 --> 46:57.912
They say, a horse's penis
even gave Buddha an erection.

47:07.089 --> 47:10.024
I am Seol,
a Kaesong concubine.

47:13.062 --> 47:18.022
With one glimpse,
I can tell you are special.

47:26.075 --> 47:28.976
You are the Bewitcher.

47:32.081 --> 47:34.049
Best of the bunch!

47:36.051 --> 47:38.986
I'll see you
in the palace soon.

47:39.054 --> 47:40.521
Yes, Your Highness.

47:43.058 --> 47:45.993
Anyone else?

47:55.070 --> 47:57.971
That's inedible!

48:07.116 --> 48:08.105
Stand up.

48:09.685 --> 48:12.085
Where was this jewel found?

48:12.154 --> 48:16.022
I'm Jung-hwa,
Neungju Lord JO's daughter.

48:16.125 --> 48:18.116
Do you know
what you just ate?

48:18.427 --> 48:23.126
It is heifer's uterus,
preserved with garlic,

48:24.133 --> 48:25.834
a placenta dish.

48:25.834 --> 48:28.203
It's my favorite dish.

48:28.203 --> 48:32.040
How did it taste?

48:32.040 --> 48:34.031
It was sorrowful.

48:35.711 --> 48:37.076
Sorrowful?

48:38.647 --> 48:43.084
Teardrops on a pillow,
raindrops on a step stone,

48:44.086 --> 48:48.250
over the window,
rain falls all night,

48:49.625 --> 48:54.062
and a mother's jacket...

48:58.133 --> 49:01.102
turns crimson.

49:12.181 --> 49:16.174
A true diamond
in the rough.

49:18.153 --> 49:21.145
You are... the Master.

49:22.224 --> 49:25.125
I am honored, Your Highness.

49:25.627 --> 49:28.163
- Minister IM!
- Yes, Your Highness!

49:28.163 --> 49:30.799
I want her in the palace
right now!

49:30.799 --> 49:32.201
- But it is not...
- Your Highness.

49:32.201 --> 49:36.160
Good things come to
those who wait.

49:36.538 --> 49:39.842
You should observe
until she's ripe.

49:39.842 --> 49:41.173
Observe?

49:44.913 --> 49:48.110
If you so insist.

49:49.184 --> 49:54.178
The fact is, I feel so empty
and lonely.

49:56.191 --> 50:00.150
Please rush the training.

50:00.229 --> 50:02.163
Yes, Your Highness!

50:03.799 --> 50:06.168
I never anticipated
this contest,

50:06.168 --> 50:08.904
but of all the girls,
why her?

50:08.904 --> 50:12.135
You see,
it's unfolding as I've told you.

50:12.207 --> 50:13.174
Nonsense!

50:14.176 --> 50:18.780
When I think of my life in exile,
while her father...

50:18.780 --> 50:23.183
Do you think I'd hand over
such power to them?

50:28.657 --> 50:33.151
Lord JO's daughter?
What a treacherous pair!

50:33.862 --> 50:39.129
How could the lMs support
a daughter of their nemesis?

50:43.739 --> 50:48.142
But I can see why
he would support her.

50:49.745 --> 50:54.114
Yes, there's something
special about her,

50:54.182 --> 50:57.152
even her scent is...

50:57.152 --> 50:58.176
Enough!

50:59.154 --> 51:02.123
Minister YU!

51:02.691 --> 51:04.793
Get it together!

51:04.793 --> 51:06.228
My apologies!

51:06.228 --> 51:10.566
From Neungju, right?
Find out more about her.

51:10.566 --> 51:12.227
- Certainly.
- Right now!

51:13.268 --> 51:16.169
You better up your game!

51:22.244 --> 51:26.203
Looks like the butchering
gave you the edge.

51:26.281 --> 51:30.183
But for an uneducated
peasant,

51:30.252 --> 51:32.988
how did you come up
with such a poem?

51:32.988 --> 51:36.185
Even a lowly girl has
good taste buds,

51:36.258 --> 51:40.160
I just tried to mimic
what I learned.

51:40.262 --> 51:41.627
Begin.

51:57.879 --> 52:00.177
As if in a dream,

52:00.248 --> 52:05.242
a wave of realization
came over him.

52:33.348 --> 52:40.277
Her delicate hand gesture
startled his pupils,

52:41.289 --> 52:50.322
and melted
his frozen memories.

53:09.384 --> 53:13.343
Can a father's crimes
be inherited?

53:13.855 --> 53:23.321
She was traitor Lord KIM ll-son's
daughter Dan-hee.

53:47.422 --> 53:51.358
Your transfixion left you
ignorant to my presence.

53:51.426 --> 53:53.394
My apologies, Your Highness.

54:05.440 --> 54:07.476
As with last time,

54:07.476 --> 54:11.378
you bring me many delights.

54:12.013 --> 54:14.345
I'm not worthy,
Your Highness.

54:17.486 --> 54:22.389
I'll soon open a banquet
to test your training.

54:22.457 --> 54:26.393
The winner will not only
become my consort,

54:26.461 --> 54:28.463
she'll receive
a large sum of gold...

54:28.463 --> 54:30.397
When I am in the palace,

54:30.499 --> 54:34.401
even a million gold coins
hold no value.

54:41.476 --> 54:45.378
Then what'd
make you happy?

54:47.415 --> 54:52.375
This sword knows the answer,
but how could you not?

54:55.423 --> 54:56.412
Minister IM!

54:56.491 --> 54:58.493
Soong-jae! Come at once!

54:58.493 --> 54:59.425
Right away!

55:00.395 --> 55:02.363
- Let's play a game!
- Yes, Your Highness.

55:02.430 --> 55:04.398
Come, you adorable things!

55:11.006 --> 55:14.464
Did you notice the way
the king looked at Jung-hwa?

55:14.543 --> 55:16.477
What do you mean?

55:18.213 --> 55:21.444
We must change
our way of thinking.

55:21.516 --> 55:25.253
Consort JANG's girl is
no ordinary candidate.

55:25.253 --> 55:26.555
We can't lose this to JANG.

55:26.555 --> 55:30.525
Rush the liquor serving training
so Jung-hwa can move up.

55:30.525 --> 55:32.527
She is still far from ready.

55:32.527 --> 55:34.495
If we rush this
before she's ready...

55:34.563 --> 55:37.065
Do you still
not know the king?

55:37.065 --> 55:39.533
He'll suck her dry
and throw her out,

55:40.135 --> 55:44.435
it's better to send her in early,
and bring about a new change.

55:50.078 --> 55:52.478
Must Minister YU do this?

55:54.482 --> 55:55.506
Sit down!

55:57.485 --> 56:02.445
Imagine him as the king,
and entice him with drinks.

56:10.131 --> 56:11.530
Stop.

56:17.239 --> 56:18.536
Stop.

56:25.580 --> 56:26.547
Stop!

56:29.584 --> 56:30.573
Go on!

56:38.260 --> 56:39.488
Hear ye!

56:39.561 --> 56:43.298
Must I be humiliated
by a worthless pussy?

56:43.298 --> 56:46.201
Maybe you don't look like the king.

56:46.201 --> 56:47.602
Remove her at once.

56:47.602 --> 56:50.503
SEOL is up next!

56:54.576 --> 56:56.510
May I

56:57.612 --> 57:00.581
offer you a precious view?

57:04.586 --> 57:07.656
Your Highness,
what do you see?

57:07.656 --> 57:11.592
It is a featherless quail!

57:13.228 --> 57:14.593
Your Highness!

57:15.630 --> 57:17.598
Now what do you see?

57:17.666 --> 57:22.626
It is pink, and wet,
like a ripe persimmon.

57:23.705 --> 57:26.640
I shall tell you what it is.

57:27.375 --> 57:32.642
What a strange sight,
what a bold sight!

57:32.981 --> 57:38.647
Like a mouth of an old monk,
so bald and toothless!

57:41.156 --> 57:46.594
Like a valley shaped by
centuries of rain.

57:46.661 --> 57:52.634
Like a groove in the wood,
made by a sharp axe.

57:52.634 --> 57:57.628
Like an oasis,
it is always wet and flowing.

57:59.674 --> 58:04.245
Like an abalone
waggling its tongue.

58:04.245 --> 58:08.717
Like a large seed
inside a dried persimmon.

58:08.717 --> 58:14.678
Like a proud rooster
with bright comb on its head.

58:15.690 --> 58:19.728
An abalone, a persimmon,
a rooster and water!

58:19.728 --> 58:23.664
It's a magnificent feast!

58:30.705 --> 58:31.706
Enough!

58:31.706 --> 58:34.342
I told you to treat him
like the king!

58:34.342 --> 58:36.674
I've made a grave mistake.

58:38.713 --> 58:41.648
JO Jung-hwa is next!

58:44.753 --> 58:50.623
Minister, we aren't here to
save appearances.

58:50.725 --> 58:54.627
May I suggest one of
the king's favorite plays?

58:54.696 --> 58:56.630
Will you accept?

58:57.365 --> 59:01.665
For every drink I down,
take an article off.

59:02.170 --> 59:05.807
If I pass out before
you're naked, you win.

59:05.807 --> 59:09.743
If I still stand,
your body is mine.

59:10.779 --> 59:13.748
This is not appropriate,
please retract.

59:13.748 --> 59:18.708
I didn't realize you could be
so easily offended.

59:20.121 --> 59:22.681
Please continue.

59:25.794 --> 59:28.763
Have you heard of
a nut-cruncher?

59:29.831 --> 59:31.731
What is it?

59:31.800 --> 59:34.701
It is an old method

59:35.804 --> 59:38.705
to tame bulls and hogs.

01:00:00.795 --> 01:00:04.799
A bull's hormones cause it
to behave aggressively,

01:00:04.799 --> 01:00:08.701
so it is better to castrate it
when the time comes.

01:00:08.770 --> 01:00:12.729
It is just a hunk of meat,
there's no use for the sack.

01:00:12.807 --> 01:00:16.766
It's a repulsive sack of skin,
it's better off gone!

01:00:17.745 --> 01:00:18.813
You bitch!

01:00:18.813 --> 01:00:22.772
Even if you are a king,
you must treat a lady fairly.

01:00:23.251 --> 01:00:25.787
You're no different than
animals with testicles.

01:00:25.787 --> 01:00:26.776
What?

01:00:28.823 --> 01:00:30.723
Please stop.

01:00:50.812 --> 01:00:54.714
If you can't even endure this,
how will you bed the king?

01:00:55.383 --> 01:00:57.715
You'd better just quit.

01:00:59.787 --> 01:01:01.721
I'll try again.

01:01:04.759 --> 01:01:08.354
Murderous intent will
blunt your moves.

01:01:15.837 --> 01:01:18.772
Have you fallen for her?

01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:23.843
If you take a king's plaything,
3 generations will perish!

01:01:24.846 --> 01:01:26.848
We are grooming
is a beast, not king.

01:01:26.848 --> 01:01:33.151
When we scratch its itch,
we're rewarded handsomely.

01:01:33.888 --> 01:01:38.825
Once that stops,
the beast will swallow us whole!

01:01:40.828 --> 01:01:43.797
Eliminate useless feelings.

01:01:47.835 --> 01:01:49.826
Empty your mind!

01:01:51.673 --> 01:01:54.005
Do you really intend to
have me bed him?

01:01:54.342 --> 01:01:55.104
What?

01:01:55.176 --> 01:01:57.804
Are you training me,

01:01:58.813 --> 01:02:00.882
or showing me
that you're jealous?

01:02:00.882 --> 01:02:01.849
Nonsense!

01:02:01.849 --> 01:02:05.876
You asked me if I consider
myself as medicine.

01:02:06.321 --> 01:02:08.881
And what it treats.

01:02:09.958 --> 01:02:12.256
I'll answer you now.

01:02:17.899 --> 01:02:20.891
I am medicine
prescribed to you.

01:02:21.736 --> 01:02:25.832
But your feelings for me
defies the king.

01:02:32.714 --> 01:02:34.875
ls your daughter still sick?

01:02:35.917 --> 01:02:37.885
She's... recovering.

01:02:37.952 --> 01:02:44.858
But I just don't see her
around anymore.

01:02:53.601 --> 01:02:55.831
Let's be frank.

01:02:58.873 --> 01:03:02.866
You've gone too far
this time.

01:03:02.944 --> 01:03:04.512
What do you mean?

01:03:04.512 --> 01:03:08.380
The king's tastes are
rather unique.

01:03:08.683 --> 01:03:15.885
Why is he attracted to
whores or butchers?

01:03:16.591 --> 01:03:23.394
Perhaps a tyrant and butcher
are a match made in heaven.

01:03:25.033 --> 01:03:27.001
Hurry up and get ready!

01:03:28.936 --> 01:03:30.904
Good afternoon, sir.

01:03:33.007 --> 01:03:34.975
Looking for this?

01:03:39.981 --> 01:03:41.983
Why is it so sharp?

01:03:41.983 --> 01:03:44.975
Just best prepared for
the performance.

01:06:04.125 --> 01:06:06.116
That's it...

01:06:06.828 --> 01:06:08.295
So fair...

01:06:54.141 --> 01:06:56.132
Come on.
Come at me!

01:07:11.259 --> 01:07:13.261
Protect the king!

01:07:13.261 --> 01:07:14.228
Your Highness!

01:07:14.295 --> 01:07:16.264
Protect him!

01:07:16.264 --> 01:07:18.255
Protect His Highness!

01:07:19.267 --> 01:07:21.201
Your Highness!

01:07:22.270 --> 01:07:25.205
Take him out of here!

01:07:26.274 --> 01:07:28.174
Hurry!

01:07:40.221 --> 01:07:42.212
It's poison-laced!

01:07:42.890 --> 01:07:45.222
A rare poison used
in China.

01:07:46.060 --> 01:07:48.229
This is the antidote,
treat him.

01:07:48.229 --> 01:07:49.253
How did you get this?

01:07:49.697 --> 01:07:52.632
We're on the same boat now,
understood?

01:08:02.243 --> 01:08:03.978
Was that really necessary?

01:08:03.978 --> 01:08:08.312
How can I watch
a butcher bed the king?

01:08:08.983 --> 01:08:13.249
Plus, she must have been
scheming.

01:08:13.321 --> 01:08:15.289
It had to be done.

01:08:17.325 --> 01:08:19.259
Did you...

01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:22.285
know who she really was?

01:08:23.029 --> 01:08:26.968
You pathetic idiot!
Haven't I warned you?

01:08:26.968 --> 01:08:30.604
You can't give everything up
over petty feelings!

01:08:30.604 --> 01:08:33.233
Petty feelings?

01:08:34.308 --> 01:08:37.277
I am not incompetent
like you.

01:08:37.345 --> 01:08:38.312
What?

01:08:38.312 --> 01:08:41.983
Obedience and flattery
will not work forever.

01:08:41.983 --> 01:08:42.716
Why you!

01:08:42.716 --> 01:08:46.278
When mother committed suicide
during exile,

01:08:46.354 --> 01:08:49.055
you did nothing but watch.

01:08:49.055 --> 01:08:50.725
- Shut your mouth!
- I'm not like you!

01:08:50.725 --> 01:08:53.260
I have the power
over the king!

01:08:53.260 --> 01:08:57.219
Because I am
king above the king!

01:08:57.298 --> 01:08:58.265
Shut up!

01:09:00.334 --> 01:09:03.703
Keep quiet
and watch how I do it.

01:09:03.703 --> 01:09:07.367
What would you
threaten me with?

01:09:07.774 --> 01:09:12.412
Forgot what you really gave
the king that night?

01:09:12.412 --> 01:09:16.783
Will you betray your father
over a girl?

01:09:16.783 --> 01:09:19.274
Like father, like son.

01:09:19.353 --> 01:09:23.380
Like a father who gave up
his family for power!

01:09:32.366 --> 01:09:36.325
The assassin's already dead,
and no clue whatsoever.

01:09:36.404 --> 01:09:39.305
How will you conclude
this matter?

01:09:39.372 --> 01:09:43.332
Since you favor Jung-hwa,

01:09:43.411 --> 01:09:46.781
other comforters
may have instigated this...

01:09:46.781 --> 01:09:48.339
This is treason.

01:09:48.416 --> 01:09:50.350
How dare you!

01:09:50.417 --> 01:09:52.185
Ln king's presence!

01:09:52.185 --> 01:09:53.345
Minister.

01:09:54.154 --> 01:09:55.679
Do you really believe that?

01:09:55.890 --> 01:10:00.194
Your Highness,
this has to be treason!

01:10:00.194 --> 01:10:04.392
What of your reputation
if your life was at risk over

01:10:05.032 --> 01:10:07.364
mere comforters' jealousy?

01:10:07.968 --> 01:10:12.337
You must wipe out
your enemies with this chance.

01:10:13.074 --> 01:10:14.371
Who knows?

01:10:14.909 --> 01:10:17.070
The real perpetrator
may be among them.

01:10:21.382 --> 01:10:23.373
Bring out the daughters
of traitors!

01:10:24.385 --> 01:10:27.320
This is unfair.
Please save me.

01:10:35.396 --> 01:10:37.762
Rash behavior will be met
with discipline.

01:10:38.866 --> 01:10:40.026
Get up!

01:10:41.368 --> 01:10:42.562
Drag her out!

01:10:50.978 --> 01:10:54.345
My father obtained
this poison from China.

01:10:55.950 --> 01:10:58.316
With enough dosage,

01:10:58.385 --> 01:11:01.286
it could lead to death.

01:11:01.388 --> 01:11:05.347
During exile, my mother didn't
want to burden my father,

01:11:05.926 --> 01:11:07.791
so she drank this.

01:11:09.196 --> 01:11:12.393
We obtained power that way,

01:11:13.434 --> 01:11:16.369
so we ended up like this.

01:11:17.304 --> 01:11:22.367
I've told you everything,
now it's your turn.

01:11:23.244 --> 01:11:25.371
Why did you attempt
to kill the king?

01:11:25.446 --> 01:11:29.216
- What do you mean?
- I knew Lord KIM ll-son.

01:11:29.216 --> 01:11:32.447
He was a respected official
and an upright man.

01:11:33.087 --> 01:11:36.386
He was executed for
criticizing the king.

01:11:36.457 --> 01:11:37.424
Please stop.

01:11:38.392 --> 01:11:40.461
- His remains must be...
- Stop!

01:11:40.461 --> 01:11:43.396
You do not deserve to
utter his name.

01:11:43.464 --> 01:11:45.432
You must give up
your revenge plot.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:47.434
It's all pointless.

01:11:47.434 --> 01:11:52.394
For a power chaser,
it's all pointless to you.

01:11:53.474 --> 01:11:55.408
I will stop you.

01:11:56.310 --> 01:11:59.370
If you do,
you will lose your life.

01:12:03.484 --> 01:12:06.476
I will use all my power

01:12:06.754 --> 01:12:08.222
to get you out.

01:12:08.222 --> 01:12:10.417
IM Soong-jae.

01:12:11.358 --> 01:12:13.451
ls that power...

01:12:14.528 --> 01:12:17.361
really yours?

01:12:30.544 --> 01:12:33.514
This is unjust!

01:12:33.514 --> 01:12:35.448
Minister IM has arrived!

01:12:37.051 --> 01:12:39.451
Minister! Minister!

01:12:39.553 --> 01:12:40.520
Minister!

01:12:41.488 --> 01:12:42.512
Please save me!

01:12:43.490 --> 01:12:45.458
This is unfair!

01:12:45.526 --> 01:12:48.495
Should have been careful,
Minister YU!

01:12:49.463 --> 01:12:51.431
Soong-jae...

01:12:51.532 --> 01:12:55.434
For Consort JANG's sake,
I'll let you keep your neck,

01:12:55.502 --> 01:12:57.493
so sit back and rest.

01:12:59.540 --> 01:13:03.442
You are all wives
and daughters

01:13:03.544 --> 01:13:06.614
of those who plotted my death!

01:13:06.614 --> 01:13:10.516
You'll be punished accordingly!

01:13:10.618 --> 01:13:12.519
Have mercy, Your Highness!

01:13:12.519 --> 01:13:18.325
But you may be pardoned
at today's shooting ceremony.

01:13:18.325 --> 01:13:24.598
And I will accept you back
as my comforters.

01:13:24.598 --> 01:13:27.328
We're eternally grateful!

01:13:29.603 --> 01:13:30.865
Prime Minister's daughter!

01:13:32.206 --> 01:13:33.195
Come forward!

01:13:42.082 --> 01:13:43.549
Come here.

01:13:50.591 --> 01:13:55.528
I'll aim, you just let
the arrow loose.

01:13:56.563 --> 01:13:57.552
Yes, Your Highness.

01:14:08.609 --> 01:14:10.600
Father! Father!

01:14:12.613 --> 01:14:14.581
Heaven's wrath...

01:14:15.215 --> 01:14:16.614
No!

01:14:20.421 --> 01:14:21.615
Remove her!
Next!

01:14:24.625 --> 01:14:28.584
If you look away,
you'll be flagged!

01:14:30.631 --> 01:14:32.565
Let the game begin.

01:14:32.633 --> 01:14:33.657
Treason

01:14:37.638 --> 01:14:39.239
Left!

01:14:39.239 --> 01:14:41.308
Next!

01:14:41.308 --> 01:14:44.641
He embraced the comforters
and fired the arrows.

01:14:45.245 --> 01:14:49.545
Left! Right!
All direct hits,

01:14:49.683 --> 01:14:53.585
the girls shed tears of blood.

01:14:54.188 --> 01:14:58.591
A twisted celebration!

01:14:58.659 --> 01:15:04.398
He danced
and jumped in joy,

01:15:04.398 --> 01:15:09.700
it was a gruesome
sight to behold!

01:15:13.674 --> 01:15:14.698
He's not it!

01:15:16.744 --> 01:15:18.679
He's not what?

01:15:18.679 --> 01:15:20.714
That man is not
my husband.

01:15:20.714 --> 01:15:25.651
You were mine all along,
Your Highness.

01:15:27.721 --> 01:15:29.689
How will you prove it?

01:15:41.702 --> 01:15:43.693
No!

01:15:44.671 --> 01:15:46.696
Stop!

01:16:11.832 --> 01:16:15.097
If he's not your husband,
then he should die.

01:16:17.805 --> 01:16:18.772
Don't move!

01:16:19.406 --> 01:16:20.134
Your Highness!

01:16:25.779 --> 01:16:26.768
Come on!

01:16:27.281 --> 01:16:28.305
Do it!

01:16:40.494 --> 01:16:45.761
Tear her into pieces,
and feed her to the pigs!

01:16:46.767 --> 01:16:49.702
Soong-jae,
the mood is ruined.

01:16:50.771 --> 01:16:51.760
Your Highness...

01:17:05.819 --> 01:17:08.754
So many rejects.

01:17:14.828 --> 01:17:18.866
Those who are called
are the contest rejects.

01:17:18.866 --> 01:17:22.825
You'll be reassigned
or become slaves!

01:17:23.537 --> 01:17:25.767
HAN Ja-soon, HYE Dang-hwa,

01:17:25.873 --> 01:17:28.774
HYANG ll-hwa, SO Hyang,

01:17:28.876 --> 01:17:31.811
SEOL, and JO Jung-hwa.

01:17:42.890 --> 01:17:43.857
What is it?

01:17:44.291 --> 01:17:46.860
Suffering such humiliation
over a butcher girl.

01:17:46.860 --> 01:17:48.760
What a pity.

01:17:49.830 --> 01:17:51.798
Stupid whore.

01:17:51.865 --> 01:17:55.858
Please ask Consort JANG
and put me back in.

01:17:56.837 --> 01:18:01.069
You want to be back
in the contest?

01:18:01.842 --> 01:18:05.801
Rumor says, a traitor's daughter
is a comforter.

01:18:06.947 --> 01:18:11.316
She was put in that place
by someone high up.

01:18:16.924 --> 01:18:20.860
Your Highness, may your
loyal subject speak?

01:18:20.928 --> 01:18:21.929
Yes, what is it?

01:18:21.929 --> 01:18:27.901
The contest may be ruined,
but a winner must be decided.

01:18:27.901 --> 01:18:34.830
And she must fulfill her duty.

01:18:35.442 --> 01:18:37.842
What should I do?

01:18:37.911 --> 01:18:41.847
Result is important,
but so is the process.

01:18:41.949 --> 01:18:47.819
I asked the head trainer to
recommend the best one.

01:18:47.921 --> 01:18:53.917
But, she came up with
two names instead.

01:18:55.929 --> 01:18:57.897
Two names?

01:18:58.665 --> 01:19:01.902
Then pit them
against each other.

01:19:01.902 --> 01:19:05.939
Ergo, I had them brought here.

01:19:05.939 --> 01:19:07.930
Bring them in!

01:19:13.981 --> 01:19:16.950
All right,
show your faces.

01:19:23.523 --> 01:19:24.591
Your Highness!

01:19:24.591 --> 01:19:28.629
They no longer have
any right to compete.

01:19:28.629 --> 01:19:31.962
They've poured their souls
into the contest,

01:19:32.032 --> 01:19:34.967
and had been
outstanding candidates,

01:19:35.035 --> 01:19:38.972
so if they're deprived
of their chance,

01:19:38.972 --> 01:19:42.976
how can we say that
we're selecting the best?

01:19:42.976 --> 01:19:44.944
- Your Highness!
- Enough!

01:19:45.012 --> 01:19:47.913
I was sorry to let them go.

01:19:47.981 --> 01:19:50.884
Let's have a final match!

01:19:50.884 --> 01:19:53.876
Yes, Your Highness.

01:19:56.023 --> 01:19:58.958
- You're a schemer!
- Why're you so enraged?

01:19:59.860 --> 01:20:03.964
It's not like she'll die
in his bed.

01:20:03.964 --> 01:20:09.925
Or can you not love someone
tainted by the king?

01:20:12.973 --> 01:20:14.975
Must you be so cruel?

01:20:14.975 --> 01:20:17.944
No matter what,
you can't have her.

01:20:18.979 --> 01:20:21.782
She has no feelings for you.

01:20:21.782 --> 01:20:24.945
Why not just take her?
That's more like you.

01:20:25.652 --> 01:20:27.916
Love isn't your style.

01:20:30.023 --> 01:20:34.960
I will set you straight,
even if I have to kill you!

01:20:36.997 --> 01:20:39.898
I'll look forward to it,
my Lord.

01:20:56.983 --> 01:20:59.952
Use the hidden silver knife,
no mistake.

01:21:00.020 --> 01:21:01.988
Minister, you can't come in!

01:21:11.665 --> 01:21:14.067
I heard the rules,
so don't worry...

01:21:14.067 --> 01:21:16.467
So you'll do it
at all cost?

01:21:17.904 --> 01:21:20.031
Life itself is prison
for me.

01:21:21.074 --> 01:21:22.576
I'll take whatever punishment.

01:21:22.576 --> 01:21:24.976
Fine, if that's your wish.

01:21:25.045 --> 01:21:27.047
This is the final lesson.
Strip.

01:21:27.047 --> 01:21:29.038
- Lord!
- It's an order!

01:21:36.056 --> 01:21:39.992
Lose, you'll die,
win, you won't survive.

01:21:40.060 --> 01:21:43.029
If you so desire to die,
listen carefully.

01:21:43.096 --> 01:21:47.032
Remember this sensation
with your body.

01:21:51.805 --> 01:21:53.540
Be aroused first,
and you lose.

01:21:53.540 --> 01:21:56.202
Not aroused, you lose.

01:21:56.610 --> 01:21:59.010
Control your own senses,

01:21:59.413 --> 01:22:01.973
and you become the best.

01:22:31.878 --> 01:22:33.106
It's not too late.

01:22:33.580 --> 01:22:35.207
Give it up
and leave at once.

01:22:36.883 --> 01:22:41.047
Do you still entertain
such futile hope?

01:22:41.154 --> 01:22:45.090
I promised never to
get you killed.

01:22:46.126 --> 01:22:51.029
Fate played tricks on us.
I owe you nothing.

01:22:51.097 --> 01:22:54.089
Such warmth
from a cold heart.

01:22:55.469 --> 01:23:00.140
Even if my body isn't,
my heart is frozen solid.

01:23:00.140 --> 01:23:04.099
I will have you
and melt your heart.

01:23:05.879 --> 01:23:11.112
Even if it does beat,
I will not become yours.

01:23:11.818 --> 01:23:14.184
Tell me,
that you'll stop.

01:23:15.222 --> 01:23:17.057
Just tell me.

01:23:17.057 --> 01:23:21.153
Prove it with your life,
then I will say it.

01:23:47.754 --> 01:23:55.160
Most desirable woman would
seduce with her scent...

01:23:55.228 --> 01:23:57.128
I'm bored.

01:23:58.865 --> 01:24:03.097
One cannot claim to be the best
by killing a few soldiers.

01:24:03.169 --> 01:24:08.232
One must defeat
the enemy general.

01:24:11.278 --> 01:24:14.247
A tiger and a phoenix.

01:24:15.248 --> 01:24:18.240
Seduce each other
before me.

01:24:21.254 --> 01:24:28.160
I will award the winner
with the loser's pretty head.

01:24:32.265 --> 01:24:37.237
Your Highness,
this is against nature.

01:24:37.237 --> 01:24:40.229
Look at their eyes
and say that.

01:24:42.842 --> 01:24:47.245
We've forbid any contact
between comforters...

01:24:48.281 --> 01:24:52.217
Must I cut off your tongue?

01:25:04.764 --> 01:25:06.197
Begin.

01:25:16.343 --> 01:25:18.311
Good, very good.

01:25:34.294 --> 01:25:37.229
Good...

01:25:43.336 --> 01:25:45.271
That's it!

01:25:45.271 --> 01:25:47.340
So Soong-jae trained
Jung-hwa?

01:25:47.340 --> 01:25:51.242
I did everything possible
for your pleasure.

01:26:01.287 --> 01:26:03.255
So, is it SEOL?

01:26:06.359 --> 01:26:08.350
Get into it!

01:26:15.368 --> 01:26:17.302
That's right.

01:26:22.108 --> 01:26:23.336
Yes.

01:26:24.110 --> 01:26:25.338
Bit more.

01:26:27.047 --> 01:26:29.277
Don't stay still.

01:26:30.417 --> 01:26:32.385
That's right!

01:26:43.997 --> 01:26:45.862
Jung-hwa this time?

01:26:50.370 --> 01:26:52.361
Jung-hwa, concentrate!

01:26:57.410 --> 01:26:59.344
Good!

01:27:03.349 --> 01:27:04.338
Very good!

01:27:05.418 --> 01:27:07.409
Oh come on.

01:27:09.055 --> 01:27:12.388
Flip over, flip!

01:27:13.460 --> 01:27:15.428
Don't lose, keep going!

01:27:15.929 --> 01:27:17.419
Seek your chance!

01:27:18.465 --> 01:27:20.456
Keep going, harder!

01:27:33.813 --> 01:27:35.542
Keep moving, go on!

01:27:36.149 --> 01:27:38.379
It's not over! Go on!

01:27:38.451 --> 01:27:42.387
Concentrate! Keep going!

01:27:43.890 --> 01:27:46.381
We're almost there!

01:27:49.496 --> 01:27:53.432
Try harder.
Harder.

01:27:55.468 --> 01:27:57.436
Tired already?

01:28:05.445 --> 01:28:09.472
Unable to finish
without an instrument?

01:28:13.520 --> 01:28:18.457
It is pitiful and desperate.

01:28:19.526 --> 01:28:25.465
A struggle towards the sun.

01:28:25.532 --> 01:28:31.437
Venting with a dagger in hand.

01:28:31.538 --> 01:28:38.467
The dragon's hand
swings ferociously,

01:28:38.545 --> 01:28:43.516
and the snake's tongue
remains silent.

01:28:43.516 --> 01:28:44.505
Soong-jae!

01:28:45.518 --> 01:28:49.477
This is what I've been
waiting for!

01:28:50.523 --> 01:28:54.653
Be aroused first, you lose,
not aroused, you still lose.

01:28:56.462 --> 01:28:59.132
Control your own senses,

01:28:59.132 --> 01:29:01.464
and you become the best.

01:29:27.560 --> 01:29:28.549
That's it!

01:29:37.570 --> 01:29:41.563
I'm dead,
I'll lose my head!

01:29:42.575 --> 01:29:43.564
Move aside.

01:29:44.077 --> 01:29:47.614
Didn't you promise me
a pretty head?

01:29:47.614 --> 01:29:50.583
And I'm fulfilling that now.

01:29:50.583 --> 01:29:51.317
Let the girl go.

01:29:51.317 --> 01:29:55.515
But she won't be pretty
if dead.

01:29:55.588 --> 01:29:56.577
What?

01:30:06.566 --> 01:30:10.559
A true Makhana lotus!

01:30:11.604 --> 01:30:13.239
Your Highness...

01:30:13.239 --> 01:30:18.575
Make SEOL her slave and
I'll bed the winner tomorrow.

01:30:24.550 --> 01:30:26.518
Let's go another round.

01:30:33.559 --> 01:30:37.552
Delicate flower,
with its crimson radiance,

01:30:39.632 --> 01:30:43.568
greets the young east
forgetting to bloom.

01:30:44.570 --> 01:30:49.530
ls the sky dark
blinded by madness?

01:30:50.576 --> 01:30:55.104
Or is the sky turned dark
by a bleak mind?

01:31:07.126 --> 01:31:09.253
My old friend.

01:31:09.729 --> 01:31:11.631
You still got it.

01:31:11.631 --> 01:31:12.598
You're too generous.

01:31:12.665 --> 01:31:16.624
Now, as promised,
let's hear your request.

01:31:19.372 --> 01:31:23.570
Please select another girl
as your new consort.

01:31:27.180 --> 01:31:29.580
Are you in love with her?

01:31:29.649 --> 01:31:32.584
Do you remember when
we were young?

01:31:32.652 --> 01:31:34.620
I did everything
you told me to do.

01:31:34.687 --> 01:31:36.656
Even if it wasn't fit
for a boy.

01:31:36.656 --> 01:31:39.625
Yes, we were close
as these balls.

01:31:40.626 --> 01:31:44.619
So I beg of you,
give her to me!

01:31:44.697 --> 01:31:46.631
How dare you!

01:31:46.699 --> 01:31:52.660
Coveting a king's property
is punishable by death!

01:31:54.640 --> 01:31:56.574
Answer me this.

01:31:57.677 --> 01:32:02.614
Do you desire her
at the risk of your life?

01:32:12.692 --> 01:32:13.716
Soong-jae...

01:32:14.727 --> 01:32:17.696
Do you also believe
I'm mad?

01:32:17.764 --> 01:32:24.636
No sane man can live through
this turbulent age.

01:32:25.772 --> 01:32:27.706
Turbulent age?

01:32:28.274 --> 01:32:32.677
My madness has turned
the sky black!

01:32:34.280 --> 01:32:36.680
Will you stop me?

01:32:37.717 --> 01:32:40.686
Even after
deflowering thousands,

01:32:42.221 --> 01:32:45.679
the ghosts of the dead
won't leave me!

01:32:45.758 --> 01:32:50.695
I've gone utterly insane!

01:33:00.740 --> 01:33:05.677
Life is like
dew on grass leaves...

01:33:08.815 --> 01:33:10.715
Go on.

01:33:10.817 --> 01:33:12.785
Please stop me.

01:33:14.787 --> 01:33:19.492
Your Majesty,
kill me instead!

01:33:19.492 --> 01:33:21.722
No, no!

01:33:23.196 --> 01:33:26.566
How can I kill
a loyal subject?

01:33:26.566 --> 01:33:32.698
You couldn't fulfill your duty
due to my lack of virtue!

01:33:32.805 --> 01:33:34.705
Stop me...

01:33:34.774 --> 01:33:37.709
Please! Please!

01:33:37.810 --> 01:33:40.711
Your Highness!

01:33:43.749 --> 01:33:45.740
Let go!

01:33:48.788 --> 01:33:49.755
Your Majesty!

01:33:49.822 --> 01:33:51.722
Baby!

01:33:56.562 --> 01:33:59.725
Who dared to bother
my little baby.

01:33:59.799 --> 01:34:00.766
My baby.

01:34:01.767 --> 01:34:04.759
Rest easy in
mommy's bosom.

01:34:06.772 --> 01:34:09.832
That's it,
everything's all right.

01:34:13.546 --> 01:34:16.845
I'll take care of him,
leave us now.

01:34:51.284 --> 01:34:53.081
It is time, my lady.

01:35:02.862 --> 01:35:04.659
I'm here for
the new consort.

01:35:29.889 --> 01:35:32.892
This was the only way
to save you.

01:35:32.892 --> 01:35:35.918
The boat will depart soon,
don't ever come back.

01:35:42.668 --> 01:35:43.896
But how...

01:35:44.904 --> 01:35:47.839
It was her request.

01:36:19.038 --> 01:36:20.972
Are you ready?

01:36:25.645 --> 01:36:27.943
Make no mistake.

01:36:44.997 --> 01:36:47.989
We cannot
miss this chance.

01:36:55.975 --> 01:36:59.342
If you hear the signal,
kill everyone.

01:37:00.413 --> 01:37:03.940
Even the new consort.

01:37:17.063 --> 01:37:20.328
I've waited long for
this moment.

01:37:21.767 --> 01:37:26.033
I too felt the same.

01:37:51.063 --> 01:37:52.963
Your Highness!

01:37:53.065 --> 01:37:57.024
Before you can have me,
you must solve a riddle.

01:37:59.038 --> 01:38:00.062
A riddle?

01:38:01.440 --> 01:38:02.742
Go on then.

01:38:02.742 --> 01:38:07.042
It normally floats, but sinks
at times.

01:38:07.580 --> 01:38:10.845
You have 3 chances
to solve it.

01:38:21.127 --> 01:38:23.061
Stop right there!

01:39:02.134 --> 01:39:04.136
Floats but sinks?

01:39:04.136 --> 01:39:05.805
Can a man ride it?

01:39:05.805 --> 01:39:07.102
You're close.

01:39:07.273 --> 01:39:09.104
A horse?

01:39:09.175 --> 01:39:14.112
Your Highness!
You really don't know?

01:39:19.185 --> 01:39:21.153
Or a palanquin?

01:39:22.221 --> 01:39:26.157
One last chance,
what is your answer?

01:39:54.887 --> 01:39:55.921
It's a boat!

01:39:55.921 --> 01:39:59.152
It normally floats,
but sinks in harsh waters.

01:39:59.725 --> 01:40:04.162
I shall ride you,
you're my boat today!

01:40:08.167 --> 01:40:11.102
Unfortunately, you're wrong.

01:40:12.938 --> 01:40:17.102
It keeps a boat afloat
or sinks it.

01:40:17.877 --> 01:40:19.174
It is water.

01:40:19.778 --> 01:40:23.148
It is said, the people is water,
the king is the boat.

01:40:23.148 --> 01:40:26.174
You're the boat that
the water will sink today!

01:40:45.838 --> 01:40:47.169
Sly bitch...

01:40:50.209 --> 01:40:53.144
Your Highness!
Are you all right?

01:41:01.787 --> 01:41:03.152
Who hired you?

01:41:03.822 --> 01:41:08.225
The king is not fit to rule,
so I did what anyone'd do.

01:41:10.262 --> 01:41:11.490
Bring him in.

01:41:17.269 --> 01:41:20.204
Lord JO,
is this your daughter?

01:41:24.243 --> 01:41:27.178
Spare me,
Your Highness.

01:41:27.246 --> 01:41:29.180
Please...

01:41:29.915 --> 01:41:31.212
Minister IM...

01:41:31.283 --> 01:41:33.986
Please speak on my behalf!

01:41:33.986 --> 01:41:35.783
How could we...

01:41:37.256 --> 01:41:38.587
Next.

01:41:43.262 --> 01:41:48.165
My lady,
glad to see you alive.

01:41:49.868 --> 01:41:56.171
You there,
is this your daughter?

01:41:58.277 --> 01:42:02.179
No better than
a mad butcher!

01:42:02.247 --> 01:42:03.214
Get a grip!

01:42:03.282 --> 01:42:05.182
Please!

01:42:07.853 --> 01:42:09.252
Next.

01:42:18.330 --> 01:42:20.298
Here it is,
Your Highness.

01:42:21.333 --> 01:42:24.268
This was hard to find.

01:42:24.336 --> 01:42:28.295
I'll ask for the last time.

01:42:29.308 --> 01:42:32.277
ls she your daughter?

01:42:33.278 --> 01:42:35.246
Lord KIM ll-son!

01:42:35.314 --> 01:42:36.281
Father...

01:42:36.348 --> 01:42:38.316
Why are you silent?

01:42:43.322 --> 01:42:45.847
So disloyal!

01:42:46.258 --> 01:42:50.062
Why isn't anyone
answering me!

01:42:50.062 --> 01:42:53.293
Why! Why?

01:42:59.938 --> 01:43:02.041
You are pathetic.

01:43:02.041 --> 01:43:03.308
What?

01:43:03.308 --> 01:43:07.301
Surrounded by pigs
busy stuffing themselves,

01:43:08.347 --> 01:43:10.372
with your eyes and
ears shut,

01:43:11.083 --> 01:43:13.347
who'll tell you the truth?

01:43:14.119 --> 01:43:19.158
What is the truth you're
so desperate to tell?

01:43:19.158 --> 01:43:21.360
Go on, tell me.

01:43:21.360 --> 01:43:27.299
Become a human,
if not a king.

01:43:37.409 --> 01:43:38.376
Soong-jae.

01:43:39.044 --> 01:43:44.416
ls this a masterpiece or
should I put your name on it?

01:43:44.416 --> 01:43:49.752
I am solely to be blamed
for my son's faults.

01:43:49.955 --> 01:43:54.722
Please take my life
and forgive him!

01:43:55.060 --> 01:43:56.322
Forgive?

01:43:57.362 --> 01:44:00.332
How can I forgive anyone,
when I can't even

01:44:00.332 --> 01:44:02.357
recognize my mother's
belongings?

01:44:03.402 --> 01:44:08.396
Remember this?
A symbol of our relationship.

01:44:08.474 --> 01:44:14.674
Without this, I'd still be
a plaything for her enemies.

01:44:15.013 --> 01:44:19.382
So let me ask,
why'd you bring me this?

01:44:19.451 --> 01:44:23.789
I was sincerely looking after
your well-being...

01:44:23.789 --> 01:44:25.416
My well-being?

01:44:27.126 --> 01:44:32.428
I used it to solidify my throne,
and you regained power.

01:44:33.432 --> 01:44:36.367
Your sincerity is noted.

01:44:37.035 --> 01:44:38.969
So can I throw it away now?

01:44:43.442 --> 01:44:44.476
Your Highness!

01:44:44.476 --> 01:44:46.111
But it's your mother's article!

01:44:46.111 --> 01:44:51.447
It's my mother's,
so why do you care?

01:44:53.452 --> 01:44:58.389
The late king worried about
seeds of trouble,

01:44:59.458 --> 01:45:04.395
so any articles that
belonged to the queen

01:45:04.463 --> 01:45:07.398
were all destroyed.

01:45:11.303 --> 01:45:12.463
Father...

01:45:19.211 --> 01:45:22.481
Did you really took me
for a fool?

01:45:22.481 --> 01:45:27.519
The late queen was indeed
killed by conspiracy...

01:45:27.519 --> 01:45:29.180
I'll ask again!

01:45:30.189 --> 01:45:36.128
When a king makes an error,
should his subjects object,

01:45:36.128 --> 01:45:40.428
or should they comply
for the fear of their lives?

01:45:40.499 --> 01:45:42.534
A loyal subject should...

01:45:42.534 --> 01:45:47.539
Pandering to my needs,
regardless of its consequences,

01:45:47.539 --> 01:45:49.473
you're a treacherous subject!

01:45:49.541 --> 01:45:52.544
You blinded me with flattery,

01:45:52.544 --> 01:45:57.504
you're a traitor
who ruined this nation!

01:45:59.551 --> 01:46:03.487
Your Highness!
Please take my life!

01:46:03.555 --> 01:46:07.457
No loyal servants exist
in my court,

01:46:08.560 --> 01:46:10.528
only faithful dogs.

01:46:10.596 --> 01:46:17.502
But a dog should not be
put down over one bite.

01:46:31.583 --> 01:46:34.518
What an interesting family.

01:46:34.586 --> 01:46:38.522
A father, who offered
his own wife's keepsake,

01:46:38.590 --> 01:46:42.526
and his son,
who offered his lover.

01:46:47.599 --> 01:46:51.535
What will you do
for me now?

01:46:55.307 --> 01:46:58.071
Can you bring me
paint for the drawing?

01:47:12.124 --> 01:47:13.591
Get out.

01:47:22.634 --> 01:47:23.623
Do it.

01:47:24.670 --> 01:47:28.606
I've no reason to live...

01:47:54.666 --> 01:47:56.657
Yes, this is it.

01:48:00.672 --> 01:48:05.575
This is my reward to you,
so retain your loyalty.

01:48:05.644 --> 01:48:08.169
I'm eternally grateful.

01:48:09.348 --> 01:48:12.647
And recruit for the next
group of comforters.

01:48:12.751 --> 01:48:14.651
No mistakes this time.

01:48:14.720 --> 01:48:16.688
Yes, Your Majesty.

01:48:26.732 --> 01:48:30.668
Dying in your hand
will be an honor.

01:48:47.719 --> 01:48:50.188
She'll be taken
out of the palace.

01:48:50.188 --> 01:48:52.418
Treat her well.

01:48:53.725 --> 01:48:57.661
That is the reason
why I kept you alive.

01:49:05.437 --> 01:49:06.734
This was your sister's,

01:49:07.205 --> 01:49:09.765
and the only detachable one
from the screen.

01:49:10.375 --> 01:49:12.741
I'd have used it too,

01:49:12.811 --> 01:49:16.747
to avenge a sister
who met a shameful death.

01:49:18.517 --> 01:49:21.748
Shouldn't have trusted
a whore.

01:49:23.789 --> 01:49:26.690
Care for an amusement?

01:49:27.793 --> 01:49:30.996
When blood river soaks
the dry land,

01:49:30.996 --> 01:49:33.765
old boat's clamors
shake the world!

01:49:33.765 --> 01:49:35.699
Cowardly boatman!

01:49:35.767 --> 01:49:38.759
Seize the moment to build
a new boat!

01:49:41.773 --> 01:49:45.732
Treacherous words from
a treacherous subject.

01:49:48.780 --> 01:49:50.771
Round everyone up!

01:49:51.716 --> 01:49:53.785
Close the door,
another purge is coming!

01:49:53.785 --> 01:49:59.724
Hide yourself,
they'll take you away!

01:50:01.526 --> 01:50:02.720
You are all pigs!

01:50:02.794 --> 01:50:05.797
Fattened up
on the king's lands,

01:50:05.797 --> 01:50:08.433
and offered
back to the king!

01:50:08.433 --> 01:50:12.733
That is the very reason
of your life!

01:50:14.739 --> 01:50:18.732
Peasant blood and sweat
fueled the king's madness,

01:50:19.244 --> 01:50:22.702
it knew no boundary.

01:50:22.814 --> 01:50:27.486
If the screams of his populace
don't stop his dance,

01:50:27.486 --> 01:50:31.684
he must be stopped
at any cost.

01:50:31.756 --> 01:50:34.748
When IM returns with
new comforters,

01:50:34.826 --> 01:50:39.764
public's rage will be at its limit,
we'll start the rebellion.

01:50:39.764 --> 01:50:43.723
You bastards!
Heaven will judge you.

01:50:43.835 --> 01:50:46.804
Go to hell, you bastards!

01:50:47.739 --> 01:50:49.764
Don't you have family?

01:51:00.318 --> 01:51:01.751
How is she?

01:51:01.820 --> 01:51:03.720
She's a stubborn one.

01:51:10.262 --> 01:51:12.992
Why is everyone
so desperate to die?

01:51:27.846 --> 01:51:30.838
I've returned from duty,
Your Highness.

01:51:35.587 --> 01:51:36.815
Where is everyone?

01:51:36.888 --> 01:51:41.293
Due to long travel,
I've allowed them to rest.

01:51:41.293 --> 01:51:43.061
But I should at least
greet them!

01:51:43.061 --> 01:51:47.794
They will look better
when they are rested.

01:51:49.868 --> 01:51:53.872
All right,
I can wait a night.

01:51:53.872 --> 01:51:59.777
You must also be tired,
so rest up.

01:52:01.813 --> 01:52:04.805
Go now.
Take a rest.

01:52:05.817 --> 01:52:07.751
Thank you, Your Highness.

01:52:14.893 --> 01:52:15.860
Anyone there?

01:52:15.927 --> 01:52:18.862
Yes, Your Highness,
are you all right?

01:52:18.930 --> 01:52:20.898
They should all be
rested, right?

01:52:20.966 --> 01:52:21.933
Pardon me?

01:52:21.933 --> 01:52:23.924
I wish to see
the comforters now.

01:52:24.436 --> 01:52:27.539
But I must alert
the security guards...

01:52:27.539 --> 01:52:29.871
You can be
my security detail!

01:52:30.508 --> 01:52:31.873
Get ready at once!

01:52:31.943 --> 01:52:35.902
Your Highness,
Minister IM is here.

01:52:38.950 --> 01:52:40.884
Soong-jae!

01:52:41.886 --> 01:52:43.655
If you had everything ready,

01:52:43.655 --> 01:52:46.886
you should've told me before
I got drunk.

01:52:47.892 --> 01:52:48.859
Forgive me.

01:52:48.927 --> 01:52:50.895
I was too conscious
of others.

01:52:50.895 --> 01:52:52.863
It's okay, very good.

01:52:53.898 --> 01:52:59.904
Everyone's so afraid of me,
always, 'Your Highness!'

01:52:59.904 --> 01:53:01.895
Shut the hell up!

01:53:02.874 --> 01:53:03.908
Damn it!

01:53:03.908 --> 01:53:05.899
- Soong-jae!
- Yes, bud!

01:53:06.344 --> 01:53:12.908
Let's have some real fun,
like we did as kids!

01:53:22.994 --> 01:53:24.894
Girls!

01:53:26.998 --> 01:53:29.933
Soong-jae,
where is everyone?

01:53:31.569 --> 01:53:35.740
What's going on?
Don't joke around!

01:53:35.740 --> 01:53:36.934
Do you remember?

01:53:37.008 --> 01:53:39.943
The girl role play,
that you liked?

01:53:40.011 --> 01:53:41.308
What?

01:53:41.980 --> 01:53:46.940
Now, you take the role
that I always had to play.

01:53:48.687 --> 01:53:50.712
You must be mad!

01:53:52.590 --> 01:53:55.889
If you want it intact,
hide it.

01:54:04.002 --> 01:54:06.004
What's going on?

01:54:06.004 --> 01:54:09.030
- My Lord!
- What happened?

01:54:11.076 --> 01:54:15.080
Don't be upset
over the past.

01:54:15.080 --> 01:54:18.982
I understand,
I'll forget about this.

01:54:19.084 --> 01:54:20.949
So sheath your sword.

01:54:24.089 --> 01:54:26.387
Sheath your sword!

01:54:28.059 --> 01:54:31.995
The world will be better off
without it.

01:54:34.032 --> 01:54:35.066
Fine, fine.

01:54:35.066 --> 01:54:37.068
You think I won't do it?

01:54:37.068 --> 01:54:38.035
I will...

01:54:48.079 --> 01:54:50.013
Your Majesty!

01:54:58.056 --> 01:54:59.045
Yes, Lord!

01:55:13.104 --> 01:55:14.093
Enough!

01:55:15.106 --> 01:55:18.075
How dare you
look at me that way!

01:55:18.543 --> 01:55:22.113
Contempt for the king
won't go unpunished!

01:55:22.113 --> 01:55:28.052
I only see a murderer,
so where is the king?

01:55:40.632 --> 01:55:44.102
Do you still feel inferior
for your mother's passing?

01:55:44.102 --> 01:55:47.094
Since you love blood so much,
how fitting!

01:55:47.839 --> 01:55:49.908
Why are you doing this?

01:55:49.908 --> 01:55:54.112
Evil wins power,
so all desire to be more evil.

01:55:54.112 --> 01:55:57.882
It's the source of our tragedy,
and what tortures your soul!

01:55:57.882 --> 01:56:00.043
I shall uproot it.

01:56:00.118 --> 01:56:02.887
Even if I die,
you can't take my place!

01:56:02.887 --> 01:56:08.086
Friend! Evil is replaced by
a greater evil.

01:56:10.929 --> 01:56:13.159
You underestimate me!

01:56:18.903 --> 01:56:20.131
Your Highness.

01:56:20.205 --> 01:56:25.108
I'll bring out the comforters,
and leave you be.

01:56:25.176 --> 01:56:30.136
Pale skin, full buttocks,
sharp nose tip.

01:56:30.815 --> 01:56:33.113
They fit your taste,

01:56:33.184 --> 01:56:36.821
so please fulfill your duty
as a king.

01:56:36.821 --> 01:56:38.118
You bastard!

01:56:39.157 --> 01:56:42.126
Stop right there!

01:57:13.291 --> 01:57:16.226
ls anyone outside?

01:57:20.265 --> 01:57:22.165
Let's go!

01:57:25.270 --> 01:57:27.238
Do not back down!

01:57:28.273 --> 01:57:32.209
We must take the palace!

01:57:33.211 --> 01:57:35.202
Captain!

01:57:37.882 --> 01:57:39.250
Minister YU,
you brought reinforcement.

01:57:39.250 --> 01:57:42.151
We can't last very long
this way.

01:57:42.220 --> 01:57:43.209
Still no orders from the king?

01:57:43.288 --> 01:57:46.155
He's nowhere to be found.

01:57:49.894 --> 01:57:52.192
The palace gate is open!

01:57:52.263 --> 01:57:54.231
Advance!

01:57:56.234 --> 01:57:57.223
Minister!

01:58:00.972 --> 01:58:02.874
What took you so long?

01:58:02.874 --> 01:58:07.208
I want nothing more than
to save this country!

01:58:07.912 --> 01:58:10.312
I heard that fox Soong-jae
visited you.

01:58:11.049 --> 01:58:15.281
How can you lead the uprising
with his help?

01:58:21.326 --> 01:58:25.296
And, I know I'm late
to the party,

01:58:25.296 --> 01:58:29.232
but reserve me a spot
in the court.

01:58:29.334 --> 01:58:31.234
Advance!

01:58:36.341 --> 01:58:41.278
IM Soong-jae!

01:58:42.280 --> 01:58:43.348
Traitors!

01:58:43.348 --> 01:58:45.282
Are you not afraid
of the heavens?

01:58:45.350 --> 01:58:47.318
Do you not know who I am?

01:58:47.318 --> 01:58:48.319
Of course we do!

01:58:48.319 --> 01:58:52.490
A former concubine,
who feeds off the populace,

01:58:52.490 --> 01:58:57.257
you're just a temptress
who fueled tyranny!

01:58:57.328 --> 01:58:58.317
Take her out!

01:58:58.730 --> 01:59:01.332
You're just a pathetic pawn!

01:59:01.332 --> 01:59:04.301
I was a loyal subject...

01:59:09.407 --> 01:59:13.309
Die, you bitch!

01:59:29.427 --> 01:59:33.131
Do it! I can't endure
more shame!

01:59:33.131 --> 01:59:35.361
You've done so much harm,

01:59:36.367 --> 01:59:38.069
you call this shame?

01:59:38.069 --> 01:59:42.369
It wouldn't be enough to
rip you to shreds!

01:59:48.346 --> 01:59:51.372
What are you waiting for?
Kill me!

02:00:01.059 --> 02:00:04.551
Did you think you could
redeem yourself this way?

02:00:05.363 --> 02:00:08.298
I too have blood
on my hands,

02:00:08.366 --> 02:00:11.358
how am I any different
from the mad king?

02:00:13.371 --> 02:00:17.375
If you could at least
laugh at me...

02:00:17.375 --> 02:00:19.343
Stay alive.

02:00:20.378 --> 02:00:23.313
Your sins will not
wash away so easily.

02:00:23.381 --> 02:00:27.340
Survive and live to undo
all your wrongs.

02:00:28.352 --> 02:00:30.343
Undo everything.

02:00:32.390 --> 02:00:36.383
Majesty, I'll take care of her,
please stay back!

02:00:39.330 --> 02:00:40.319
Your Highness!

02:00:43.367 --> 02:00:47.371
Why're you wearing
the king's robe?

02:00:47.371 --> 02:00:50.374
I am playing my part as
the treacherous subject.

02:00:50.374 --> 02:00:53.144
What have you done
to deserve it?

02:00:53.144 --> 02:00:56.341
A hero is a nobody
during peace,

02:00:56.414 --> 02:01:00.384
and a moral man is useless
on the battlefield.

02:01:00.384 --> 02:01:02.352
What's the difference?

02:01:02.420 --> 02:01:04.285
Father!

02:01:04.355 --> 02:01:05.344
No, my son.

02:01:06.057 --> 02:01:07.358
It's not too late.

02:01:07.358 --> 02:01:08.426
Where did you hide
the king?

02:01:08.426 --> 02:01:10.461
We should kill him first!

02:01:10.461 --> 02:01:12.395
Power cannot be contained.

02:01:12.463 --> 02:01:13.430
Nonsense!

02:01:13.498 --> 02:01:16.434
Like you said, we can build
a higher levee!

02:01:16.434 --> 02:01:17.468
Have you gone blind?

02:01:17.468 --> 02:01:19.437
You're the blind one!

02:01:19.437 --> 02:01:23.141
I know you started everything
for that bitch!

02:01:23.141 --> 02:01:27.407
Move aside, I'll kill her
and bring you back!

02:01:27.478 --> 02:01:30.447
Enough!

02:01:31.449 --> 02:01:36.352
This is the only way for me
as your son.

02:01:42.393 --> 02:01:44.428
No, no, please!

02:01:44.428 --> 02:01:45.452
Please no! Please!

02:01:46.397 --> 02:01:47.465
You can't! Please!

02:01:47.465 --> 02:01:49.399
No! No!

02:01:51.435 --> 02:01:54.472
Soong-jae, my son!

02:01:54.472 --> 02:01:59.432
For upholding tyranny,
creating a mad king,

02:02:00.444 --> 02:02:04.215
blinding you with power,
being a terrible son,

02:02:04.215 --> 02:02:06.410
I'll pay for it all.

02:02:08.152 --> 02:02:09.483
Please...

02:02:11.155 --> 02:02:14.959
No, you have to live!

02:02:14.959 --> 02:02:18.417
How can I face your mother
if you die like this?

02:02:18.496 --> 02:02:20.464
- No, please!
- Fools...

02:02:20.531 --> 02:02:23.466
How did you not know?

02:02:29.540 --> 02:02:31.542
You destroyed both of us.

02:02:31.542 --> 02:02:36.479
We could have accomplished
so much together.

02:03:03.507 --> 02:03:08.444
I thought we had the dragon
but it's only 2 vipers.

02:03:09.614 --> 02:03:11.548
Drinking bud,

02:03:12.550 --> 02:03:15.542
it will only end by
taking my life, right?

02:03:16.587 --> 02:03:18.521
Do you have a last wish?

02:03:18.623 --> 02:03:23.560
Take that whore,
and send her far away.

02:03:24.595 --> 02:03:26.586
She's rather irritating.

02:03:39.110 --> 02:03:41.544
Do you have any regrets?

02:03:42.280 --> 02:03:43.542
Regrets?

02:03:44.582 --> 02:03:50.578
I had the king and the world
at my fingertips.

02:03:52.256 --> 02:03:54.588
I had my share
of the world.

02:03:55.259 --> 02:04:01.528
Your vile reputation will
last a millennium.

02:04:08.205 --> 02:04:10.605
The king is not here,
move out!

02:04:18.683 --> 02:04:24.622
Rest easy now.

02:05:00.691 --> 02:05:03.626
Do you also covet
my comforters?

02:05:09.033 --> 02:05:10.694
Go on and take them.

02:05:15.740 --> 02:05:20.700
The pigs had the last laugh!

02:05:25.716 --> 02:05:29.020
1506 A.D.
After Joseon's first uprising,

02:05:29.020 --> 02:05:32.683
The Beauty Recruits perished
With King Yeonsan-gun.

02:05:32.757 --> 02:05:38.718
Those who led the reform soon became
the new treacherous subjects.

02:05:40.698 --> 02:05:43.690
Not quite civil officers,

02:05:44.702 --> 02:05:46.670
but more than a concubine.

02:05:46.771 --> 02:05:50.674
Not quite selection process,

02:05:50.674 --> 02:05:53.700
but exercising power
that was given.

02:05:54.745 --> 02:05:57.714
How could I best explain this?

02:05:59.383 --> 02:06:01.681
So what happened
to the mad king in the end?

02:06:01.752 --> 02:06:03.687
Haven't you been listening?

02:06:03.687 --> 02:06:06.918
His sexual appetite
got him banished,

02:06:07.258 --> 02:06:10.795
so comforters were what
got him killed!

02:06:10.795 --> 02:06:12.695
Good riddance!

02:06:12.763 --> 02:06:17.700
Tell us once more about how
the treacherous lMs were killed!

02:06:17.768 --> 02:06:18.757
Yeah!

02:06:20.805 --> 02:06:24.741
The lMs tried to help
a concubine,

02:06:24.809 --> 02:06:28.711
and the two were found
in ashes.

02:06:29.814 --> 02:06:32.715
Do that to me too!

02:06:33.751 --> 02:06:35.719
Their ashes were spitted on,

02:06:35.786 --> 02:06:40.723
and they deserved
the worst fate in the world.

02:06:42.493 --> 02:06:44.791
If your drinks are empty,
get going!

02:06:45.429 --> 02:06:46.157
Hurry!

02:06:49.800 --> 02:06:51.768
It's here! It's starting!

02:07:02.780 --> 02:07:07.740
It is 3 years into
the era of tyranny,

02:07:08.819 --> 02:07:15.526
the two lMs were
up to no good,

02:07:15.526 --> 02:07:19.826
so desperate to get on
the king's good side,

02:07:20.865 --> 02:07:23.800
can't just let this
cruelty continue!

02:07:23.868 --> 02:07:28.805
The enraged mountain god
sent a tiger!

02:07:30.875 --> 02:07:34.811
I'm gonna hurt my back!

02:07:35.846 --> 02:07:38.781
Empty your pockets!

02:07:42.887 --> 02:07:48.859
It searched the world for
deluded subjects,

02:07:48.859 --> 02:07:54.498
It searched and searched
but could not find them.

02:07:54.498 --> 02:07:58.832
Hidden behind a human mask,
can't tell what's in his heart.

02:08:00.905 --> 02:08:07.037
All right, feed on my body,

02:08:07.378 --> 02:08:10.836
and if you're a good man,
I'll strengthen your body,

02:08:10.915 --> 02:08:16.876
or I'll become poison
and kill you.

02:08:24.895 --> 02:08:26.886
I found you!
