WEBVTT

00:03.069 --> 00:06.905
I don't usually meet women
as beautiful as you

00:06.907 --> 00:07.940
At a tech convention.

00:07.942 --> 00:09.308
Aw, that's very sweet.

00:09.310 --> 00:12.311
And you were definitely
the hottest guy there.

00:12.313 --> 00:14.313
(chuckles) thank you.
Although, to be fair,

00:14.315 --> 00:16.982
Being the hottest guy at a tech
convention is kind of like...

00:16.984 --> 00:19.852
Well, being the hottest guy
at a tech convention.

00:19.854 --> 00:23.022
Although, once, I saw
justin timberlake

00:23.024 --> 00:24.757
At a microsoft party.

00:24.759 --> 00:27.259
Lady boner! (laughs)

00:27.261 --> 00:31.230
Yes, he did bring sexy back
to windows 8.

00:31.232 --> 00:33.098
So, you said
you work for google?

00:33.100 --> 00:35.267
That's right, in the
modeling department.

00:35.269 --> 00:36.935
Oh, that's awesome.
Like graphic rendering

00:36.937 --> 00:37.970
And 3-d imaging?

00:37.972 --> 00:39.872
More like pointing.

00:39.874 --> 00:41.740
"new from google,

00:41.742 --> 00:44.977
Confusing tech crap."

00:44.979 --> 00:47.446
Oh, so you're, like,
a model-model?

00:47.448 --> 00:51.050
Yep. You can't spell
google without "ogle."

00:51.052 --> 00:53.052
Can you?

00:53.054 --> 00:55.387
No, you can't.

00:55.389 --> 00:58.157
But being a model at tech shows
isn't what I really want to do.

00:58.159 --> 00:59.725
I just do it to
pay the bills.

00:59.727 --> 01:01.960
Oh, I get it.
What's your ultimate goal?

01:01.962 --> 01:03.796
I want to help
teach people to read.

01:03.798 --> 01:06.999
Oh, that's noble.
So, you want to be a teacher.

01:07.001 --> 01:09.501
No, I want to be
the next vanna white.

01:09.503 --> 01:11.370
(giggles)

01:12.806 --> 01:14.640
Oh, you're serious.

01:14.642 --> 01:17.509
Yeah. I mean, she
has an amazing job,

01:17.511 --> 01:20.512
She wears amazing outfits
and she has amazing hair.

01:20.514 --> 01:23.348
Somebody needs to buy
a new, amazing adjective.

01:23.350 --> 01:26.351
You can't buy adjectives.

01:26.353 --> 01:28.620
You can only buy vowels.

01:29.589 --> 01:30.722
Right.

01:30.724 --> 01:32.324
Only vowels.

01:32.326 --> 01:34.927
Well, I owe you
another drink.

01:34.929 --> 01:36.962
"o." "k."

01:38.932 --> 01:43.402
(under breath): Certainly won't
be any "I" in "u" tonight.

01:44.537 --> 01:46.772
Wow, that girl is gorgeous.

01:46.774 --> 01:48.140
Yeah, she's a model.

01:48.142 --> 01:49.374
We don't really
have a connection.

01:49.376 --> 01:50.609
She's not very bright.

01:50.611 --> 01:52.678
I think she thinks
silicon valley is the place

01:52.680 --> 01:54.713
Where women go
to get a boob job.

01:54.715 --> 01:57.216
Oh, you want
intellectual stimulation.

01:57.218 --> 01:59.351
Uh, why don't you
watch an episode of <i>nova</i>

01:59.353 --> 02:01.687
While you're
banging her brains out?

02:01.689 --> 02:03.922
No, I'm gonna go tell her
it's not gonna work out.

02:03.924 --> 02:05.624
Well, if you don't want her,
can I have her?

02:05.626 --> 02:09.528
Oh, sure, let's change shirts.
Maybe she won't notice.

02:09.530 --> 02:10.629
Oh, she's <i>that</i> dumb?

02:10.631 --> 02:11.697
Great.

02:11.699 --> 02:13.499
Woman:
Walden!

02:13.501 --> 02:16.034
Look, a seagu...
(screams)

02:16.036 --> 02:17.269
Oh, my god.

02:17.271 --> 02:18.704
Wait.

02:18.706 --> 02:20.873
We didn't switch shirts yet.

02:22.809 --> 02:25.711
♪ men, men, men, men, manly men,
men, men ♪

02:25.713 --> 02:28.413
♪ ah.
♪ men.
♪ men.

02:34.354 --> 02:35.821
Hey, what's going on?

02:35.823 --> 02:37.055
I was cleaning out my closet

02:37.057 --> 02:38.957
And I found a box
of jake's old stuff.

02:38.959 --> 02:41.226
Aw, that's sweet.

02:41.228 --> 02:42.294
Who's jake?

02:43.530 --> 02:45.531
My son. Y-your cousin.

02:45.533 --> 02:47.766
Oh, right.

02:47.768 --> 02:50.002
Oh, and how did he die?

02:51.638 --> 02:53.906
Oh, no, h-he's not dead.
He's in the army.

02:53.908 --> 02:55.240
Huh.

02:55.242 --> 02:57.176
Ah. Nice bong.

02:57.178 --> 03:01.146
Guess he's not
fighting the war on drugs.

03:01.148 --> 03:03.081
No, that-that is
a hummingbird feeder.

03:03.083 --> 03:04.383
He made it in art class.

03:04.385 --> 03:07.052
And in shop class,
I made a train whistle.

03:07.054 --> 03:09.221
(imitates whistle):
Weed, weed!

03:09.223 --> 03:10.622
No, no, seriously.

03:10.624 --> 03:12.157
Uh, one summer,
back in high school,

03:12.159 --> 03:14.660
He and his friends
got into bird watching.

03:14.662 --> 03:17.896
They'd spend all day
out in the woods, and they'd...

03:17.898 --> 03:20.799
They'd come back laughing and...

03:22.402 --> 03:25.003
Oh, god, I'm an idiot.

03:25.005 --> 03:27.806
Don't worry.
All parents are idiots.

03:27.808 --> 03:30.709
My mom used to think I was
locked in the bathroom all day

03:30.711 --> 03:32.311
With an electric toothbrush.

03:32.313 --> 03:34.413
(buzzes)

03:34.415 --> 03:37.149
My first wife was always
using her electric tooth...

03:37.151 --> 03:38.884
God, I <i>am</i> an idiot.

03:40.119 --> 03:43.622
Oh, look at this.
One of his old report cards.

03:43.624 --> 03:46.692
Oh, you can still see where
he tried to change his grades.

03:46.694 --> 03:49.461
Yeah, he changed the c's.

03:49.463 --> 03:50.862
To d's.

03:50.864 --> 03:54.533
Yeah. That was the year
his bus got a little shorter.

03:54.535 --> 03:56.268
But, you know,
in his defense,

03:56.270 --> 03:58.003
His teacher changed
that year, too.

03:58.005 --> 04:00.739
She went from c's to d's.

04:00.741 --> 04:02.107
Is this how you're
spending your night?

04:02.109 --> 04:04.309
Oh, no, no. Later,
I'm going to shave my back.

04:04.311 --> 04:05.577
Oh, actually,
if you're not busy...

04:05.579 --> 04:07.646
I am. And so are you.

04:07.648 --> 04:09.147
I'm gonna get a drink.
Where's walden?

04:09.149 --> 04:11.350
Oh, he had to take his date
to the hospital.

04:11.352 --> 04:14.353
Ooh, what are they pulling out,
and from where?

04:14.355 --> 04:15.887
No, it-it's nothing like that.

04:15.889 --> 04:18.790
She was looking up at the sky
and she fell off the deck.

04:18.792 --> 04:20.058
High?
No.

04:20.060 --> 04:21.260
Drunk?
No.

04:21.262 --> 04:22.461
Model?
Yeah.

04:24.530 --> 04:26.398
♪ <i>men.</i> ♪

04:26.400 --> 04:27.633
How you feeling?

04:27.635 --> 04:28.767
I'm all right.

04:28.769 --> 04:30.769
Uh, well, we need
to fill out this paperwork.

04:30.771 --> 04:33.071
So, uh, first name, nadine.

04:34.440 --> 04:38.043
This is awkward.
I don't know your last name.

04:38.045 --> 04:42.047
It's h-o-r-e.

04:42.049 --> 04:45.450
H-o-r-e.

04:46.386 --> 04:48.220
Like "hooray"?

04:48.222 --> 04:50.822
No, like "whore."

04:52.292 --> 04:53.759
You think I
should change it?

04:53.761 --> 04:55.627
No, be proud.

04:55.629 --> 04:59.398
I'm sure you come from
a long line of... Hores.

05:00.700 --> 05:02.501
Uh, any relatives
I can call?

05:02.503 --> 05:04.136
No, they're
all back east.

05:04.138 --> 05:06.872
I'm the only hore
in los angeles.

05:07.940 --> 05:09.608
Agree to disagree.

05:10.810 --> 05:12.911
Emergency contacts.
Okay, so no family.

05:12.913 --> 05:15.981
Uh, friends? Roommates?

05:15.983 --> 05:18.483
Anyone you've gone on
more than one date with?

05:18.485 --> 05:19.685
Not really.

05:19.687 --> 05:20.919
I live alone.

05:20.921 --> 05:23.021
I've only been in l.A.
A couple weeks.

05:23.023 --> 05:25.390
The only men in my
life are you and frank.

05:25.392 --> 05:27.659
Oh, all right.
How do I get a hold of frank?

05:27.661 --> 05:28.760
He's a pig.

05:28.762 --> 05:30.729
(chuckles) he's a pig,
you're a hore.

05:30.731 --> 05:32.230
No one's judging.

05:32.232 --> 05:34.066
No, he's my pet pig.

05:34.068 --> 05:36.401
My little frankfurter.

05:36.403 --> 05:38.070
A pig.

05:38.072 --> 05:40.572
Does he sleep
in a blanket?

05:40.574 --> 05:42.908
Yeah, he totally
hogs the covers.

05:42.910 --> 05:46.378
(laughs) hogs. Good one.

05:47.413 --> 05:49.247
Never mind.

05:49.249 --> 05:51.783
Uh, what about medications?

05:51.785 --> 05:53.218
Love 'em.

05:53.220 --> 05:56.188
No, I-I think they mean
"are you taking any now?"

05:56.190 --> 05:59.958
Oh, let's see, there's
plaxitril for my depression,

05:59.960 --> 06:01.827
Zaxaprin for my anxiety,

06:01.829 --> 06:04.529
Dilapamin for my
insomnia, and clodex

06:04.531 --> 06:07.132
For my occasional
bouts of rage.

06:07.134 --> 06:09.835
No one likes
an angry hore.

06:15.007 --> 06:16.608
(indistinct conversations)

06:16.610 --> 06:19.277
(sighs) why didn't you tell me
we were going to a gay bar?

06:19.279 --> 06:21.146
'cause if I told you,
you wouldn't have come.

06:21.148 --> 06:24.349
Yes, I would. I just
would've dressed better.

06:24.351 --> 06:25.650
And just to be clear,

06:25.652 --> 06:27.219
You do know I'm
not gay, right?

06:27.221 --> 06:28.653
I don't think you're gay.

06:28.655 --> 06:31.757
I-I mean, do I know guys
that act less gay

06:31.759 --> 06:34.059
That have sex
with other guys? Sure.

06:35.061 --> 06:36.528
But I know
you're straight.

06:36.530 --> 06:38.563
So, why bring me here?

06:38.565 --> 06:40.065
Look around this room.

06:40.067 --> 06:42.167
See all
the women here?
Yeah.

06:42.169 --> 06:44.403
Well, some of them
are gay. Those are mine.

06:44.405 --> 06:47.005
The rest are straight.

06:47.007 --> 06:48.340
Some of those
are mine, too.

06:48.342 --> 06:50.275
And everyone who's left

06:50.277 --> 06:52.744
Is gonna be drunk and horny
by the end of the night

06:52.746 --> 06:56.548
And looking for someone who
doesn't think vaginas are yucky.

06:58.985 --> 07:00.919
Oh, oh, you mean me.

07:00.921 --> 07:03.088
(high-pitched):
Yay.

07:03.090 --> 07:04.756
(deeper voice):
I mean, yay.

07:08.327 --> 07:09.928
Okay, be careful.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.897
Mm.
Watch your leg.

07:11.899 --> 07:14.166
You smell so good.

07:14.168 --> 07:15.934
Thank you.

07:15.936 --> 07:18.904
Let's see how you taste.

07:18.906 --> 07:21.973
Okay. All right.

07:21.975 --> 07:23.708
I see the painkillers
have kicked in.

07:23.710 --> 07:25.110
Oh, they sure did.

07:25.112 --> 07:28.213
Right now, you could
do anything to me

07:28.215 --> 07:30.282
And I wouldn't remember.

07:33.553 --> 07:36.221
Did I wink?
'cause I was trying to wink.

07:36.223 --> 07:39.257
Okay, let's-let's get
you on the couch, huh?

07:39.259 --> 07:42.093
Hey, let's get you
on nadine.
Oh, okay.

07:42.095 --> 07:45.297
All right, fine.
Let's... Just rest.

07:46.799 --> 07:50.569
Thank you so much
for taking care of me.

07:50.571 --> 07:52.737
Well, you have a broken leg.

07:52.739 --> 07:54.940
You don't have
any family or friends

07:54.942 --> 07:58.243
And you live on the fourth floor
of a building with no elevator.

07:58.245 --> 08:01.913
So, I couldn't just
leave you on the street.

08:03.416 --> 08:04.850
Could I?

08:04.852 --> 08:06.651
You're handsome.

08:06.653 --> 08:07.752
(grunts)
yeah.

08:07.754 --> 08:09.754
You're... Drooling.

08:09.756 --> 08:12.090
I'm gonna get
you some food.

08:12.092 --> 08:15.594
All right, but I have
certain dietary constrictions.

08:15.596 --> 08:19.097
I don't eat wheat, dairy,
or anything with a face.

08:19.099 --> 08:20.765
Although...

08:20.767 --> 08:23.435
I would make
an exception for you.

08:27.240 --> 08:28.673
So, you're here
with your niece?

08:28.675 --> 08:31.142
Uh, yeah, she just recently
came out of the closet

08:31.144 --> 08:33.778
And she's painfully shy.
Oh. Mm-hmm.

08:37.550 --> 08:40.218
Now, that's what I
call breast-feeding.

08:42.188 --> 08:44.289
She's, uh, still trying
to find her gay legs.

08:44.291 --> 08:48.059
Ah. Well, she's lucky she has
an uncle who's found his.

08:48.061 --> 08:50.295
(sighs) no, I'm straight.

08:50.297 --> 08:52.297
Why does everybody
think I'm gay?

08:52.299 --> 08:54.366
Oh, that is way too tart.

08:54.368 --> 08:56.735
Um, so, paula,

08:56.737 --> 08:58.436
What do you do?

08:58.438 --> 08:59.938
I'm an investment banker.

08:59.940 --> 09:02.307
Oh, wow. Oh, okay,
maybe you can answer a question

09:02.309 --> 09:03.475
I've always had.
Mm-hmm?

09:03.477 --> 09:05.710
What's the penalty
for early withdrawal?

09:05.712 --> 09:08.079
Well, uh, that depends.

09:08.081 --> 09:10.081
How big is your deposit?

09:11.751 --> 09:14.586
Oh, interest is rising.

09:14.588 --> 09:17.188
You know, the longer
you keep it in,

09:17.190 --> 09:19.291
The bigger your reward.

09:20.626 --> 09:22.127
Sometimes,
the market collapses

09:22.129 --> 09:25.096
And there's nothing
you can do about it.

09:25.098 --> 09:27.399
Uh, wait. Are-are we
doing sexual innuendo

09:27.401 --> 09:29.701
Or are you asking for
free financial advice?

09:29.703 --> 09:31.536
Why can't it be both?

09:32.605 --> 09:34.205
You know,
if you're interested,

09:34.207 --> 09:36.007
I've got a malibu
beach house.

09:36.009 --> 09:39.444
Oh. Well, if you're interested,
I've got very loose morals.

09:39.446 --> 09:40.779
(high-pitched):
Yay.

09:42.615 --> 09:44.783
