WEBVTT

00:09.349 --> 00:11.624
Well, Karl, you've got two choices.

00:11.893 --> 00:14.009
Either you have the tattoo removed,

00:14.271 --> 00:18.708
or you travel the globe searching for
another soul mate named Fredwina.

00:21.111 --> 00:23.022
We'll be right back after this.

00:23.280 --> 00:26.636
I was going over this offer you got
from the Siren Cruise Line.

00:26.950 --> 00:28.668
- They wanna know...
- Roz.

00:28.910 --> 00:31.549
- You know my policy on endorsements.
- Listen.

00:31.830 --> 00:34.947
A celebrity entertainer cancelled
on a cruise to Alaska.

00:35.250 --> 00:39.209
They'll let us go for free if you fill
in. You have to give a brief lecture...

00:39.546 --> 00:42.618
Roz, I'm a psychiatrist, not a huckster.

00:42.924 --> 00:47.475
Some of us in this profession still
believe in... mahogany wainscoting?

00:47.846 --> 00:50.360
Isn't that fabulous?
Look at those staterooms.

00:50.641 --> 00:53.917
Not to mention the world-class
health spa and gourmet chefs...

00:54.227 --> 00:56.457
- It sounds tempting. It's just...
- I know.

00:56.730 --> 01:00.120
I don't think it's right to trade
on one's good name for a free trip.

01:00.442 --> 01:04.593
Plenty of people do. Look, Zubin Mehta
did one and General Schwarzkopf...

01:04.946 --> 01:06.982
It says Gore Vidal did two of them.

01:07.240 --> 01:09.993
Gore Vidal? He hates everything.

01:10.285 --> 01:14.836
If you feel it would tarnish your image,
I'll tell Vicki you decided to pass.

01:15.207 --> 01:18.324
- Vicki? Who's Vicki?
- She books the celebrities.

01:18.627 --> 01:21.460
I met her at a party.
I was surprised she remembered me.

01:21.755 --> 01:24.315
- We're on in 15 seconds.
- No, wait a minute.

01:24.591 --> 01:26.900
- It's a favour for a good friend?
- She's not.

01:27.177 --> 01:30.533
She means something to you.
You've put me in an awkward position.

01:30.847 --> 01:33.645
- Frasier, I don't care...
- All right, I'll go!

01:34.810 --> 01:38.200
This is the last time I pull your
chestnuts out of the fire.

01:40.000 --> 01:46.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:47.155 --> 01:49.464
- Hello, Dr Crane.
- Hello, Daphne.

01:49.741 --> 01:53.370
You're looking very comfortable
for afternoon.

01:53.704 --> 01:55.296
I just love days like this.

01:55.539 --> 01:57.769
Nothing to do, nowhere to go.

01:58.041 --> 02:01.556
Although I have a nagging suspicion
I've forgotten something.

02:01.878 --> 02:03.834
Like getting dressed?

02:04.798 --> 02:07.517
Oh, I could just watch the rain all day.

02:07.801 --> 02:10.315
When I was a little girl,
I hated the rain.

02:10.595 --> 02:13.393
Stuck inside, couldn't go out and play.

02:13.682 --> 02:16.799
But my mum would always say,
"Enjoy it while you can."

02:17.102 --> 02:19.013
"There'll be no water in hell."

02:19.271 --> 02:21.990
Course, that was
her answer for everything.

02:22.274 --> 02:25.744
"Eat your veggies. There'll be
no Brussels sprouts in hell."

02:26.069 --> 02:29.539
"Have a lie down.
There'll be no naps in hell."

02:33.201 --> 02:38.992
Daphne, I am a therapist. If you'd
like to talk about this sometime...

02:39.416 --> 02:41.213
About what?

02:42.461 --> 02:44.338
Nothing.

02:44.588 --> 02:46.818
Wish I could remember
what I forgot to do.

02:47.090 --> 02:48.762
Well, you know what they say:

02:49.009 --> 02:52.524
if you can't remember,
it probably wasn't important anyway.

02:52.846 --> 02:55.201
- Dad!
- Oh, no.

02:55.474 --> 02:56.668
You're dripping!

02:56.892 --> 03:00.202
That happens when you stand in the rain
waitin' for your ride.

03:00.520 --> 03:03.751
- Mr Crane, I am so sorry.
- What the hell were you thinking?

03:04.066 --> 03:07.217
Venting emotion is good,
but I've just had the floors waxed.

03:07.527 --> 03:09.643
I said 4.00
on the corner of 2nd and Bell.

03:09.905 --> 03:12.897
- You should have called me.
- I was afraid I'd miss you.

03:13.200 --> 03:16.909
Good point, Dad. If you'd just
step on this paper, please. Perfect.

03:17.245 --> 03:19.361
Oh, God, he's wet too! No!

03:19.623 --> 03:23.298
Damn him! Daphne, Daphne,
get this canine sprinkler out of here!

03:23.627 --> 03:25.663
Don't be too cross with him, Dr Crane.

03:25.921 --> 03:28.958
As me mum used to say,
there'll be no dogs in hell.

03:29.257 --> 03:31.293
I sincerely doubt that.

03:33.220 --> 03:35.415
- Niles.
- Frasier. Hey, Dad.

03:35.681 --> 03:38.115
I'm returning your cookbook.
I won't need it.

03:38.392 --> 03:42.146
I thought you were preparing
an anniversary dinner for Maris.

03:42.479 --> 03:45.118
Not this year.
Maris is flying to a clinic in the Alps

03:45.399 --> 03:47.788
for an experimental
rejuvenation treatment.

03:48.068 --> 03:50.059
Only one man performs the procedure,

03:50.320 --> 03:53.710
and she wants to see him
before he's extradited.

03:54.032 --> 03:56.671
- I'm so sorry.
- It's so depressing.

03:56.952 --> 04:00.911
Every time we approach a breakthrough
in our therapy, Maris runs away.

04:01.248 --> 04:04.399
I hoped that spending time together
on our anniversary

04:04.710 --> 04:06.223
would get us over the hump.

04:06.461 --> 04:09.453
There, there, Niles.
I know it's difficult when someone

04:09.756 --> 04:13.874
puts their own selfish obsession above
your emotional needs. Here you are.

04:14.219 --> 04:16.494
Take off that wet coat
and stay for dinner.

04:16.762 --> 04:20.233
I'll get us a couple of hot toddies
like we used to make at Duke's.

04:20.559 --> 04:24.188
Dad, you know, there's a recipe
in this book for a hot toddy.

04:24.521 --> 04:29.276
It calls for Courvoisier,
camomile tea and a dash of Framboise.

04:29.651 --> 04:34.566
Garnish it with a few rose petals, and
that's just how Duke used to serve it.

04:34.948 --> 04:36.779
Make yourself at home.

04:37.034 --> 04:40.071
Poor Niles.
You know, Dad, maybe I should...

04:40.370 --> 04:42.520
Stop! I know what you're gonna say.

04:42.789 --> 04:46.384
You wanna persuade Maris
to spend her anniversary with Niles.

04:46.710 --> 04:50.100
- I didn't realise I was so predictable.
- You are. If you ask me...

04:50.422 --> 04:52.617
Stop! I know what you're going to say.

04:52.883 --> 04:55.841
I should mind my own business,
keep my big bazoo shut.

04:56.136 --> 04:59.173
I was gonna say "fat yap",
but you're in the ballpark.

04:59.473 --> 05:03.352
When two people are arguing, their
emotions can get the better of them.

05:03.685 --> 05:07.155
- A third party can provide perspective.
- They have a therapist.

05:07.481 --> 05:12.396
If Niles needs more help, he's got Dr
Jim Beam here, and he makes house calls.

05:12.778 --> 05:16.930
I'm not trying to make you feel guilty,
Maris. I hope you enjoy Switzerland.

05:17.282 --> 05:21.434
I have plans of my own for our
anniversary that I'm very excited about.

05:23.455 --> 05:26.208
That's a healthy approach.
What are your plans?

05:26.500 --> 05:28.855
I thought I'd sit
in my cavernous apartment,

05:29.127 --> 05:31.687
rocking back and forth
while hugging my knees.

05:33.423 --> 05:37.621
Now, Niles, you're not gonna be alone
on your anniversary. You'll have us.

05:37.970 --> 05:43.328
Well, actually, I've agreed to
give a lecture on a cruise to Alaska.

05:43.725 --> 05:46.603
But I don't see a reason
why you two shouldn't join me.

05:46.895 --> 05:49.887
- That'd be great, wouldn't it, Niles?
- I don't know.

05:50.190 --> 05:52.750
Come on, it'd take your mind
off your troubles.

05:53.026 --> 05:55.859
I appreciate it,
but whisking me off on a cruise...

05:56.154 --> 05:58.509
I'm not as emotionally fragile
as all that.

05:58.782 --> 06:02.092
As you wish. Well, Dad,
it'll just be you and me then.

06:02.411 --> 06:04.686
- Yeah. When do we leave?
- Fourteenth.

06:04.955 --> 06:07.025
The fourteenth?

06:26.184 --> 06:29.733
You know, that just gets funnier
and funnier each time you do it.

06:30.564 --> 06:32.520
No, no, I'm wrong.

06:35.610 --> 06:39.159
Hey! Some ship, huh?
How's your stateroom?

06:39.489 --> 06:42.606
I'd hardly call it a stateroom.
Wouldn't even call it a room,

06:42.909 --> 06:46.424
but I don't know the nautical term
for "broom closet with sconces."

06:46.747 --> 06:48.738
- How's yours?
- The same.

06:48.999 --> 06:52.674
Worse. I'm sure you have a better view
from your porthole than I do.

06:53.003 --> 06:55.995
- You have a porthole?
- What difference does it make?

06:56.298 --> 07:00.655
- A cabin's just a place to shower...
- You have a shower?

07:01.011 --> 07:05.562
All I have is a nozzle and floor drain.
It took me an hour to put them together.

07:06.767 --> 07:10.282
The buffets come at a good clip,
so you gotta pace yourself.

07:10.604 --> 07:15.120
And watch out for your fillers, your
breads, your rolls, your chips and dips.

07:15.484 --> 07:18.317
You've only got so much room.
Don't be a hero.

07:21.782 --> 07:25.741
- Hey, guys!
- Hey! Hey, Fras, this is great!

07:26.078 --> 07:30.071
You got one of those cabins where the
whole bathroom turns into a shower?

07:31.750 --> 07:35.948
Yes. Before you say it, I had no idea
what Spartan conditions we were in for.

07:36.296 --> 07:40.175
That's all right. Once I got over my
fear that I'd be hauled below decks

07:40.509 --> 07:43.706
and manacled to another oarsman,
I started to enjoy myself.

07:44.012 --> 07:48.722
I won't spend much time in my cabin.
I'll hobnob with my fellow celebrities.

07:49.101 --> 07:52.332
They got a lot of big names on board.
Did you see the pictures?

07:52.646 --> 07:56.195
"Live and in person:
radio star Dr Frasier Crane."

07:56.525 --> 07:58.641
- How about that?
- That's embarrassing.

07:58.902 --> 08:02.690
I don't care for "star", considering
the calibre of the others on board.

08:03.031 --> 08:06.228
"The comedy stylings of Giggles O'Shea."

08:09.997 --> 08:13.194
Oh, yes, you're in stellar company.

08:13.500 --> 08:17.573
Look, they even managed to snare a
magician: "The Amazing Lance Gould."

08:17.921 --> 08:21.436
Oh, he's great! I caught his act
in Reno a few years ago.

08:21.758 --> 08:25.114
For his finale,
he made his own head disappear.

08:25.429 --> 08:27.021
Did the toupee go, too,

08:27.264 --> 08:29.414
- or did it just hover...?
- Dear God!

08:29.683 --> 08:32.755
You've booked me
on a floating Gong Show!

08:33.061 --> 08:36.974
- What happened to Mehta and Vidal?
- I am so sorry, Frasier, I had no idea.

08:37.316 --> 08:40.352
I guess they just book
A-list celebrities on big ships.

08:40.652 --> 08:45.646
<i>Attention, please. The Taste of Alaska
buffet is served on the Lido Deck.</i>

08:46.033 --> 08:48.627
That's my cue. You guys comin'?

08:48.910 --> 08:52.983
- Dad, we had a big lunch at home.
- Rookie mistake. See you at dinner.

08:55.250 --> 08:57.889
It's not that bad.
At least you got top billing.

08:58.170 --> 08:59.762
Of course I got top billing.

09:00.005 --> 09:03.395
- I'm the only one there I've heard of!
- What about him?

09:03.717 --> 09:07.949
"Latin Singing Sensation
Carlos 'The Barracuda' Del Gato?"

09:08.305 --> 09:13.220
Remember him from the '70s? He invented
that dance craze, the Barracuda.

09:13.602 --> 09:16.241
Believe it or not,
Maris was a big fan of his.

09:16.521 --> 09:18.830
- No.
- That was the one dance she could do.

09:19.107 --> 09:21.382
The Hustle was too strenuous.

09:21.652 --> 09:23.802
She had no booty to shake...

09:26.073 --> 09:30.271
but her fetching little underbite
was just perfect for the Barracuda.

09:35.332 --> 09:38.210
Niles, why is that woman staring at you?

09:40.170 --> 09:44.243
God help me! It's that awful Mimi
Cosgrove from the country club. Hide me!

09:44.591 --> 09:46.661
She's a man-eating lush who'd go...

09:46.927 --> 09:50.317
- Niles?
- You little good-for-nothing Mimi!

09:52.015 --> 09:55.007
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, looking for the bar.

09:55.310 --> 09:56.982
Oh, there it is.

09:57.229 --> 09:59.663
- Let me buy you a cocktail.
- Oh, you know...

09:59.940 --> 10:03.410
I don't know what it is about the ocean
that makes me so thirsty.

10:03.735 --> 10:05.293
Have you been working out?

10:08.699 --> 10:11.088
Look, there he is. The Barracuda.

10:11.368 --> 10:14.963
How thrilling!
A fellow headliner on the USS Has-been.

10:15.288 --> 10:17.006
Oh, shut up.

10:17.708 --> 10:20.347
Come on,
let's go over my notes for my lecture.

10:20.627 --> 10:24.825
Dr Frasier Crane? I am Carlos Del Gato.

10:26.425 --> 10:29.974
Hello. It's a pleasure to meet you.
This is Roz Doyle.

10:30.304 --> 10:34.536
- <i>Buenas noches. ¿Habla español?</i>
- Oh, not really.

10:34.891 --> 10:40.124
It's no matter. I am sure you are
schooled in the international language.

10:40.522 --> 10:43.320
Oh, yes, Roz.
Say something amusing in Esperanto.

10:46.320 --> 10:47.435
Each night

10:47.654 --> 10:52.774
I select the most beautiful woman in my
audience and present to her a red rose.

10:53.160 --> 10:55.720
This means the evening has just begun.

10:57.289 --> 11:02.966
Perhaps one night
you will be my especial lady.

11:03.879 --> 11:05.710
Until then...

11:12.638 --> 11:16.187
OK, you're right.
We're on the voyage of the damned.

11:18.352 --> 11:20.866
- So, are you still separated?
- I'm afraid so.

11:21.146 --> 11:24.377
- Oh, you poor thing.
- Well, we're trying.

11:24.691 --> 11:26.761
- We're in therapy.
- Oh, good.

11:27.027 --> 11:29.780
You know how much
I've always thought of you and...

11:30.072 --> 11:32.142
- Maris.
- Yeah, an angel.

11:32.407 --> 11:36.685
If there's any way I can be of comfort
to you, why, you just let me know.

11:37.037 --> 11:39.597
- What is that marvellous fragrance?
- That's...

11:39.873 --> 11:43.024
Pardon, sir. The lady sends you this
with her compliments.

11:43.335 --> 11:46.725
- What lady?
- There in the black dress and veil.

11:48.131 --> 11:49.962
- Maris!
- There was one more thing.

11:50.217 --> 11:51.935
Yes?

11:58.058 --> 12:01.528
I'm sorry, sir, but she gave me
the biggest tip I've ever seen.

12:01.853 --> 12:05.732
I'm sure you can convince Maris
this is all completely innocent.

12:06.066 --> 12:08.580
If not, I'm in cabin 712.

12:10.570 --> 12:13.482
What happened?
Was that Maris I saw running out?

12:13.782 --> 12:16.580
She saw Mimi pawing me
and assumed the worst.

12:16.868 --> 12:19.587
- How upset was she?
- I couldn't see past the outfit.

12:19.871 --> 12:22.101
Who wears a black dress and veil
on a cruise?

12:22.374 --> 12:23.887
She has no pigmentation.

12:24.126 --> 12:27.516
Three minutes in the sun,
she'd sear like an ahi tuna.

12:29.965 --> 12:33.037
She's supposed to be in Switzerland.
Why's she here?

12:33.343 --> 12:34.856
Niles, Niles, I'm sorry.

12:35.095 --> 12:38.167
I'm afraid that this
may be partly my fault.

12:38.473 --> 12:42.022
You see, I left a message on her machine
saying how upset you were

12:42.352 --> 12:45.264
and it might be fun
if she could join us on the cruise.

12:45.564 --> 12:49.557
- You invited her and didn't tell me?
- I thought it would be a nice surprise.

12:49.901 --> 12:52.096
Oh, well, it worked out perfectly!

12:53.280 --> 12:56.397
She's probably arranging
to fly home from the next port.

12:56.700 --> 13:00.579
The lady who sent me the champagne,
do you know which room she's in?

13:00.912 --> 13:03.472
No, sir, but she asked me
to give you a message.

13:11.757 --> 13:15.033
Just out of curiosity,
how much are these running her?

13:17.262 --> 13:20.732
You're on in 20 minutes.
How's your speech coming?

13:21.058 --> 13:24.607
It's hard to concentrate.
I'm so concerned about Niles.

13:24.936 --> 13:28.133
I like this opening joke you wrote.
It's very funny.

13:28.440 --> 13:30.715
Thank you. I can't take all the credit.

13:31.026 --> 13:34.336
I had a patty melt with Giggles
before his show.

13:37.658 --> 13:43.210
Oh, Niles, I can't tell you again
how sorry I am for meddling.

13:44.331 --> 13:46.287
- How did it go with Maris?
- Terribly.

13:46.541 --> 13:50.580
This is without a doubt the most
depressing night of my life.

13:53.840 --> 13:56.308
That is so fun... I'm sorry.

13:57.719 --> 14:01.428
I looked for her for hours. I remembered
her fondness for the Barracuda.

14:01.765 --> 14:06.839
In the lounge, that Latin cheeseball
was crooning his ghastly song to her.

14:07.229 --> 14:09.379
I approached, then a waiter came over.

14:09.648 --> 14:13.766
By the time I got the champagne out of
my eyes, she had disappeared.

14:14.653 --> 14:18.362
I waited after the show.
She didn't come out.

14:18.699 --> 14:20.257
Neither did Del Gato.

14:20.492 --> 14:23.529
- What are you implying?
- You know her taste for revenge.

14:23.829 --> 14:28.107
If she thinks I'm having an affair with
Mimi, she'll try to punish me in kind.

14:28.458 --> 14:33.327
Wow! Do you really think
she's planning to do the Barracuda?

14:37.884 --> 14:41.559
Niles, don't jump to conclusions.

14:41.888 --> 14:43.924
That's exactly what Maris did.

14:44.182 --> 14:47.094
Says a lot about our marriage.
No trust on either side.

14:47.394 --> 14:48.907
What hope is there for us?

14:49.146 --> 14:53.298
- Is there anything I can do?
- No, you've done enough.

14:53.650 --> 14:55.959
I'm just going to take a walk.

14:56.236 --> 14:58.113
Oh, God.

14:58.363 --> 15:00.115
Oh, I feel so guilty.

15:01.074 --> 15:06.273
When will I learn to stop interfering
in other people's affairs?

15:06.663 --> 15:09.700
I better go talk to Maris
and see if I can fix this.

15:10.000 --> 15:13.595
- Are you gonna butt in again?
- What business is that of yours?

15:13.920 --> 15:15.433
- There's your dad.
- Oh, no.

15:15.672 --> 15:18.106
If he finds out,
I'll never hear the end of it.

15:18.383 --> 15:21.500
Boy, that Taste of Alaska spread
was a bust.

15:21.803 --> 15:24.681
Wanna know
what caribou meat tastes like?

15:24.973 --> 15:26.929
Not chicken.

15:28.602 --> 15:31.514
- Where's Niles?
- He's out for a walk.

15:32.606 --> 15:35.279
Oh, I may as well
tell you the whole thing.

15:35.567 --> 15:39.560
Maris is on board.
She and Niles had a horrible fight

15:39.905 --> 15:42.544
and their marriage
is in worse shape than ever.

15:42.824 --> 15:46.180
- No need telling you how she got here.
- I know, I know.

15:46.495 --> 15:49.965
- What was I thinking, inviting her?
- You invited Maris?

15:50.290 --> 15:53.760
Niles was so upset
about being alone on their anniversary.

15:54.086 --> 15:55.883
It seemed like a good idea.

15:56.129 --> 15:58.882
Smart, huh? I give you all this guff
about buttin' in

15:59.174 --> 16:01.688
and then I turn round
and do the same damn thing.

16:01.969 --> 16:04.608
Oh, Dad, don't be too hard on yourself.

16:06.264 --> 16:09.222
- Frasier?
- Oh, all right!

16:09.518 --> 16:12.078
- I invited Maris, too.
- You did?

16:12.354 --> 16:14.914
- Yeah.
- I told you to keep your bazoo shut!

16:15.190 --> 16:16.669
Oh, you're one to talk!

16:16.900 --> 16:19.460
- What are we gonna do now?
- Nothing at all.

16:19.736 --> 16:21.806
Let them resolve their own differences.

16:22.072 --> 16:24.791
- Stay on the sidelines where we belong.
- Right.

16:25.075 --> 16:29.068
- Better get going. I'll miss dinner.
- Dad, my lecture's in 15 minutes.

16:29.413 --> 16:32.052
Oh, jeez.
Well, I guess I can't do everything.

16:32.332 --> 16:34.892
Tell me how it went
at the midnight buffet.

16:37.629 --> 16:39.699
- We better go to your lecture.
- Right.

16:39.965 --> 16:43.275
- First, I'm gonna go talk to Maris.
- You just said...

16:43.593 --> 16:46.426
- Forget what I said! You come too.
- I don't know her.

16:46.722 --> 16:50.635
- You can vouch for Niles' innocence.
- All right. I'm curious to meet her.

16:50.976 --> 16:54.286
- I've never seen her face.
- I haven't seen her most recent one,

16:54.604 --> 16:57.277
so this'll be a new experience
for both of us.

16:59.026 --> 17:01.699
All right, now listen,
let me do all the talking.

17:01.987 --> 17:05.945
If it looks like she has an orange
Abyssinian on her head, don't stare.

17:06.282 --> 17:08.160
That's a wiglet.

17:10.162 --> 17:12.357
All through. Have a nice evening.

17:13.498 --> 17:16.694
Damn. She must not be here.
What are you doing? You can't go in.

17:17.002 --> 17:20.631
- I just want to see the room.
- You can't barge into someone's room.

17:20.964 --> 17:24.240
My God! Is that a grand piano?

17:25.969 --> 17:30.520
- Frasier, look.
- Barracuda's calling card.

17:30.891 --> 17:32.847
He's chosen Maris to be his...

17:33.101 --> 17:35.217
Especial lady.

17:37.814 --> 17:39.088
She's coming.

17:40.776 --> 17:43.290
Why are we hiding?
You came here to talk to her.

17:43.570 --> 17:47.165
You can't extol the virtues of trust to
someone whose room you've broken into.

17:47.491 --> 17:49.209
She's coming!

17:50.744 --> 17:51.893
Oh, dear God!

17:52.120 --> 17:55.351
- The shower is bigger than my cabin!
- Shut up!

17:58.585 --> 17:59.938
Martin!

18:02.756 --> 18:05.065
- Why are you here?
- We came to talk to Maris.

18:05.342 --> 18:07.173
- Why are you here?
- The same as you.

18:07.427 --> 18:11.306
- Why did you come in the bathroom?
- Well, what do you think?

18:13.058 --> 18:16.130
- Oh, all right.
- Let's get the hell out of here.

18:17.229 --> 18:18.378
It's Maris.

18:18.605 --> 18:21.722
What's the big deal?
Why don't we go out and talk to her?

18:22.025 --> 18:24.778
We can't. She may not be alone.
Remember the rose?

18:25.070 --> 18:26.549
Oh, God.

18:28.532 --> 18:31.604
Oh, I don't see her.
Maybe she went back out.

18:31.910 --> 18:35.061
Oh, wait, I see her coat on a hat rack.

18:36.999 --> 18:38.557
Look closer.

18:39.960 --> 18:42.190
Is the hat rack moving?

18:43.255 --> 18:46.372
- Oh my God!
- What's she doing?

18:46.675 --> 18:48.870
- She seems to be alone.
- That's good.

18:49.136 --> 18:52.287
- She's pouring champagne. Two glasses.
- That's bad.

18:52.597 --> 18:53.871
She's putting on music.

18:54.099 --> 18:56.294
<i>Do the barracuda</i>

18:58.895 --> 19:02.092
Oh, that's bad. On so many levels.

19:02.399 --> 19:04.151
She's coming this way.

19:07.279 --> 19:09.076
Shut up! Shut up!

19:26.506 --> 19:27.700
She's gone.

19:27.924 --> 19:29.801
How are we gonna get outta here?

19:30.052 --> 19:33.442
No idea, but I've got three minutes
before I have to be downstairs

19:33.764 --> 19:37.723
- or 200 people will be disappointed.
- 200 people? Where'd you hear that?

19:38.060 --> 19:40.528
They told me that was the room capacity.

19:40.812 --> 19:45.328
Oh! Oh, come on!
Giggles had to add a show.

19:46.318 --> 19:47.831
She's gonna hear us.

19:48.070 --> 19:50.425
- It's the Barracuda.
- Who's the Barracuda?

19:50.697 --> 19:52.767
A sleazy singer
Maris is gonna sleep with

19:53.033 --> 19:55.467
- to get back at Niles for kissing Mimi.
- Who's Mimi?

19:55.744 --> 19:58.463
A horny boozer and this predicament's
Mrs O'Leary's cow.

19:58.747 --> 20:01.056
- Who's Mrs O'Leary?
- A woman in Chicago who...

20:01.333 --> 20:03.130
Later! I haven't got time.

20:04.211 --> 20:07.487
We must stop her before she
damages her relationship forever.

20:07.798 --> 20:10.915
We cannot go out there now.
We don't want to walk in on them.

20:11.218 --> 20:14.016
I don't want to see that.
I just ate caribou.

20:17.724 --> 20:19.043
Oh, very well.

20:19.267 --> 20:23.340
It seems I'm the only one
who really cares about this. I will go.

20:28.694 --> 20:34.087
Maris, what a lovely bathroom!
What are you doing here?

20:34.491 --> 20:38.564
We came to convince Maris nothing was
going on. What are you doing here?

20:38.912 --> 20:43.747
Maris and I ran into each other. We had
a talk and she invited me for champagne.

20:44.126 --> 20:45.559
Oh, that's great, Niles.

20:45.794 --> 20:48.706
It might mar the mood a bit
if she finds you spying on her.

20:49.006 --> 20:51.725
- Did you use that mouthwash?
- No, no, Maris did.

20:52.009 --> 20:56.764
My God! She's in the mood
for more than champagne.

20:57.139 --> 21:00.449
You've got to leave. Give me time
to see her out to the balcony.

21:00.767 --> 21:02.359
A balcony?

21:07.190 --> 21:08.828
Count to ten and then scram,

21:09.067 --> 21:13.026
so Maris and I can celebrate the way
a man and his wife were meant to.

21:14.531 --> 21:16.362
She started without me.

21:19.161 --> 21:21.231
Drinking the champagne.
