How did you sleep?

02:13.926 --> 02:15.301
- Pretty good.
- Mm.

I didn't see Gabri's car.

02:18.972 --> 02:21.599
She called. She's fine, John.

02:21.683 --> 02:22.892
She's at Antonia's.

02:22.976 --> 02:26.729
I was hoping she'd help me ride
that new bald-faced stallion.

02:27.856 --> 02:30.942
She'd like that horse.
He turns great. Great turner.

02:33.153 --> 02:35.404
- Hmm.
- Yeah.

02:35.489 --> 02:37.323
You know, she'd be a good trainer.

02:37.407 --> 02:39.700
She's got a way with horses.

Don't you think?

02:41.161 --> 02:42.328
Mm, maybe.

02:43.163 --> 02:45.373
But she is going to college.

02:45.457 --> 02:48.501
You think she wants to smell like horses
all the time like you?

02:48.836 --> 02:51.128

Afternoon.

04:07.873 --> 04:09.707

A small knife.

04:23.972 --> 04:25.723
No, it's Damascus steel.

04:25.807 --> 04:28.809
It's a letter opener I made
for when you go away to college.

04:29.728 --> 04:31.729
And I'm gonna add on these white handles.

04:32.314 --> 04:33.314
Letter opener?

04:33.690 --> 04:35.274
It'd be beautiful on your desk.

Oh.

04:37.653 --> 04:41.989
Uh, I hate to break it to you,
but nobody writes letters anymore.

04:42.407 --> 04:43.407
Hmm.

04:44.868 --> 04:47.161
Well, then you can use it
to keep the boys away.

I have no idea what I want to do yet.

what you wanted to do at my age?

Yeah, I wanted to be a soldier.

05:04.971 --> 05:06.389

05:06.473 --> 05:08.057
Even before your age.

05:09.309 --> 05:10.518
Did you like it?

05:10.936 --> 05:14.814
Well, I had some of the best friends
I ever had for a while.

05:16.566 --> 05:21.487
It's gonna be real quiet around here
without you asking all these questions.

05:21.571 --> 05:22.613

The sun's setting. I only have
about an hour left to ride, okay?

05:30.580 --> 05:33.207
- Why is that?
- I have to go to Antonia's.

05:33.709 --> 05:37.586
She's throwing this thing for the guys
who are going to college in the fall.

05:39.339 --> 05:40.798
Why don't you invite them here?

05:41.341 --> 05:42.341
What?

05:42.426 --> 05:43.676
Bring them over here.

05:44.761 --> 05:46.846
Remember what happened last time?

05:46.930 --> 05:48.931
- You freaked them out.
- Why?

05:49.015 --> 05:50.975
Because you wouldn't stop staring at them.

05:51.059 --> 05:52.059
Oh, no.

05:52.644 --> 05:55.187
Yeah, I do that sometimes,
but it's not intentional.

05:56.815 --> 05:58.774
Thank you, but Antonia's got it covered.

05:58.859 --> 06:00.443
We're just gonna have it there, okay?

06:03.488 --> 06:04.697
Show them the tunnels.

06:06.241 --> 06:07.241
What?

06:07.325 --> 06:08.993
Show them the tunnels.

06:09.369 --> 06:11.287
You don't let anybody go in the tunnels.

06:11.997 --> 06:15.124
No, but they're your friends,

06:15.208 --> 06:16.375
so they're welcome.

06:17.544 --> 06:19.670
- Okay, cool. Yeah.
- Yeah, show them the tunnels.

06:19.755 --> 06:21.797
- Yeah, that would be fun.
- Yeah.

06:22.716 --> 06:25.384

riding with you.

06:52.579 --> 06:54.121

You never let me in the tunnels. Hmm?

I'll take you on a guided tour.

07:30.075 --> 07:31.325
No, I understand.

07:32.702 --> 07:33.994
Did you draw that?

07:34.079 --> 07:36.580
Yeah. I drew that, actually,
when I was ten years old.

07:36.665 --> 07:37.915
That's a masterpiece.

The reception is not so good.

No, no, no. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I hear you.

What are you doing down here?
All of your friends have left.

08:05.986 --> 08:08.153
They made a big mess.
I'm just cleaning up.

08:08.989 --> 08:09.989
So, how did it go?

08:10.782 --> 08:13.075
Um, everyone had a good time.

08:13.785 --> 08:16.328
They kept asking me
why my uncle built these tunnels.

08:16.746 --> 08:18.038
What did you say?

08:19.291 --> 08:23.085
I said that you like digging
and you're a little crazy.

08:23.169 --> 08:24.628
That's fair enough.

08:28.091 --> 08:30.092
I need to talk to you about something.

08:30.552 --> 08:32.885
And I just want you to have
an open mind about it.

08:35.222 --> 08:36.765
I need to go to Mexico.

08:38.351 --> 08:39.934
Why would you want to do that?

08:41.187 --> 08:43.105
Because I found my father.

08:45.191 --> 08:47.943
My friend Gizelle, who lives there...

08:48.028 --> 08:51.030
Well, she used to live here.
Do you remember her?

08:51.406 --> 08:52.990
Mm-hmm.

08:53.867 --> 08:57.786
I asked her for a favor,
and she found him.

08:59.414 --> 09:01.081
He lives in a town near hers.

09:04.085 --> 09:06.754
Uncle John, I have to do this.

09:07.630 --> 09:08.922
I need to hear it from him.

09:09.007 --> 09:12.634
I need to understand
why he would just do that.

09:12.719 --> 09:14.345
Because he's not a good man.

09:15.388 --> 09:17.765
- Can't be that simple.
- It is.

09:17.849 --> 09:20.851
Uncle John, I've heard the stories.
I know you've been through a lot.

09:20.935 --> 09:24.563
But my world is a lot different
from yours.

09:24.939 --> 09:26.190
No, it's not. It's worse.

09:26.274 --> 09:27.441
No, it's not.

09:28.234 --> 09:30.235
People don't just act bad for no reason.

09:30.320 --> 09:33.655
There's no reason for a man to throw
his family away. He's lucky he has one.

09:33.740 --> 09:36.427
- Why are you getting so mad?
- Because you don't know how bad it is.

09:36.451 --> 09:38.494
I know how black a man's heart can be.

09:38.578 --> 09:40.287
There's nothing good out there, Gabrielle.

09:40.372 --> 09:41.622
Well, maybe he's changed.

09:41.706 --> 09:43.749
Men like that don't change.
It only gets worse.

09:43.833 --> 09:45.209

I need you to know
that I'm gonna make good decisions.

09:58.223 --> 10:00.015
I can't control what's out there.

10:00.850 --> 10:02.851
You can't just protect me forever.

10:04.145 --> 10:06.814
As long as I'm around,
he's never gonna hurt you again.

10:08.108 --> 10:09.274

you thought was right and left at 17,

[boss, in Spanish]

38:13.041 --> 38:14.166
[softly]
Let her go.

38:14.792 --> 38:15.834
[in English]
What?

38:17.754 --> 38:19.004
Let her...

38:19.088 --> 38:21.256
- Let her go.
- [boss] Let her go.

38:27.639 --> 38:29.515
[breathing heavily]

38:31.267 --> 38:33.936
"John Rambo."

38:38.024 --> 38:39.441
Juanito Rambo.

38:39.526 --> 38:41.443
[laughs]

38:42.153 --> 38:43.904
Wanna know something, Juanito?

38:44.614 --> 38:47.741
These girls mean nothing to me
or my customers.

38:49.077 --> 38:51.703
In my world, they're nothing.
They're not people.

38:51.788 --> 38:55.082
They're just... They're just things.

38:56.209 --> 38:58.585
They have no worth to men like us.

38:59.254 --> 39:03.632
So I would have not
paid attention to this...

39:05.510 --> 39:06.510
to her.

39:06.594 --> 39:07.594
[Rambo groans]

39:07.679 --> 39:09.304
But now I will.

39:09.722 --> 39:13.725
Because you coming here
has made it very bad for her, cabrón.

39:14.394 --> 39:18.564
We would've just trained her,
used her and sold her.

39:19.732 --> 39:22.025
But now we're gonna make
an example of her.

39:24.153 --> 39:25.362
I'm gonna let you live.

39:27.699 --> 39:30.534
[in Spanish]

39:33.496 --> 39:36.832
[in English] You're gonna think about this
every fucking day of your fucking life.

Until you can't think anymore, Juanito.

40:42.649 --> 40:45.150
[both grunting]

40:49.030 --> 40:51.740
Okay, you have to get up.
They will come back.

41:01.709 --> 41:05.545
Let her go.

41:11.552 --> 41:13.720

Are you okay?

44:35.506 --> 44:36.756
Who are you?

44:37.967 --> 44:39.175
Carmen Delgado.

44:40.177 --> 44:41.553
What is your name?

44:42.054 --> 44:43.096
John.

44:44.765 --> 44:47.684
Your truck is in the garage, by the way.

44:50.021 --> 44:51.271
How did I get here?

44:53.107 --> 44:54.441
I brought you here.

44:54.525 --> 44:56.151
You don't even know me.

44:56.861 --> 44:58.528
Why do I have to know you?

44:59.280 --> 45:00.405
Um...

45:00.823 --> 45:02.365
You were in trouble.

45:02.992 --> 45:04.868
I don't know, I would do it for anyone.

45:05.661 --> 45:07.203
Why were you even there?

45:08.414 --> 45:10.457
I'm an independent journalist.

45:11.459 --> 45:13.543
I was following El Flaco...

45:15.588 --> 45:18.214
a pimp who drugs and sells girls.

45:19.383 --> 45:22.302
I saw you in the club, watching him.

45:23.804 --> 45:25.472
I saw what you did to him.

45:26.098 --> 45:27.515
How long have I been here?

45:28.601 --> 45:30.560
- Four days.
- Four days?

45:30.645 --> 45:31.811
Mm-hmm.

45:31.896 --> 45:32.979
Christ.

45:34.231 --> 45:35.523
You gotta tell me...

45:37.109 --> 45:38.568
Where are the men that took her?

45:38.653 --> 45:40.946
Who did they take? Your daughter?

45:41.030 --> 45:43.031
Yeah. Where is she?

45:43.115 --> 45:44.574
Who are they?

45:46.160 --> 45:47.494
The Martínez brothers.

45:48.663 --> 45:50.413
They took my sister.

45:52.041 --> 45:55.627
They found her dead from an overdose
three years ago.

45:56.921 --> 45:58.129
I'm sorry.

45:59.256 --> 46:02.926
You just gotta tell me
where you think they are.

46:03.302 --> 46:05.053
No, it doesn't work this way.

46:05.930 --> 46:07.263
There's too many of them.

46:07.348 --> 46:08.765
Are you crazy or what?

46:08.849 --> 46:11.226
I'm not thinking about that.

46:11.310 --> 46:13.019
All I can think about is...

46:14.480 --> 46:16.314
how scared she must be,

46:17.024 --> 46:18.692
what she's going through,

46:19.652 --> 46:21.653
and what your sister went through.

46:23.072 --> 46:25.907
Just help me, please.

46:25.992 --> 46:27.826
I can't do it without you.

I'm sorry.

No.

You didn't do anything.
You didn't do anything at all.

to keep your eyes open.

Keep your eyes open.

51:19.702 --> 51:21.244
Let's talk about something.

51:23.956 --> 51:26.624
I remember you were a great rider.

51:28.043 --> 51:30.837
Every event you were in,
every competition,

51:30.921 --> 51:32.588
you'd win everything.

51:33.882 --> 51:37.343
I remember you were
just about 11 years old.

51:37.428 --> 51:40.847
You won five events in one day.
That's really something.

51:41.598 --> 51:43.182

51:43.892 --> 51:46.686
You can do it. We're gonna be home soon.

51:47.521 --> 51:49.105
I'll take care of you.

51:50.065 --> 51:52.442
You got so much life left.

51:52.526 --> 51:55.611
You got so many things you gotta do.

51:56.655 --> 51:57.947
So many things.

52:00.242 --> 52:04.370
When I came home a long time ago,
you were so young.

52:04.455 --> 52:05.955
Gabrielle, you were so young.

52:07.791 --> 52:10.752
I was lost. I was a lost man.

52:11.628 --> 52:14.088
And then I met you.

52:15.674 --> 52:20.345
And I saw something
that I didn't think I'd ever see anymore:

52:21.597 --> 52:25.516
Good in this world. Some innocence.

52:25.601 --> 52:29.937
And I had a family
that I never thought I'd ever have.

52:30.022 --> 52:34.192
And raising you, it was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

52:34.276 --> 52:37.487
And I thank you for that. Thank you.

52:37.571 --> 52:38.863

I need your help.

01:00:40.971 --> 01:00:42.513
[sighs] Come in.

01:00:45.517 --> 01:00:48.018
If someone sees you, we both will die.

01:00:48.812 --> 01:00:50.479
Coming back here is so dangerous.

01:00:51.606 --> 01:00:53.899
- Did you find her?
- She's dead.

01:00:57.654 --> 01:00:58.988
Oh, I'm...

01:00:59.948 --> 01:01:01.156
I'm sorry.

01:01:02.242 --> 01:01:03.450
I really am.

01:01:03.535 --> 01:01:04.910
I know how you feel.

01:01:06.037 --> 01:01:08.914
But coming back was dangerous.

01:01:10.041 --> 01:01:11.333
Why are you here?

01:01:12.377 --> 01:01:14.628
I wanna find the thin one.

01:01:14.713 --> 01:01:16.630
- No.
- The one that cut her.

01:01:16.715 --> 01:01:18.841
- No.
- The one that cut me.

01:01:18.925 --> 01:01:21.260
I will not help you again.

01:01:21.344 --> 01:01:22.595
You have to.

01:01:22.679 --> 01:01:23.971
Why do I have to?

01:01:24.639 --> 01:01:27.433
What will change? Nothing.

01:01:28.602 --> 01:01:31.353
We grieve and move on.

01:01:32.647 --> 01:01:34.064
And you've done that?

01:01:36.818 --> 01:01:40.362
I mean, I think of her every day.

01:01:41.197 --> 01:01:42.698
Every fucking day.

01:01:45.660 --> 01:01:47.411
But we have to move on.

01:01:47.495 --> 01:01:49.955
What if you can't move on?

01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:52.541
- What if you can't move on at all?
- But you have to.

01:01:52.626 --> 01:01:54.835
We have no choice. What's done is done.

01:01:54.919 --> 01:01:56.128
Why is it done?

01:01:57.380 --> 01:01:59.715
How is it ever done?

01:02:01.468 --> 01:02:04.720
When I look at something so innocent...

01:02:06.181 --> 01:02:09.642
and I see that face
never have life in it again,

01:02:09.726 --> 01:02:14.313
how is it ever done?

01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:18.567
I want revenge.

I want them to know
that death is coming...

01:02:24.824 --> 01:02:28.994
and there's nothing
they can do to stop it.

01:02:30.246 --> 01:02:32.998
I want them to feel our grief...

01:02:34.209 --> 01:02:39.213
and know that's the last thing
they will ever feel.

01:02:41.091 --> 01:02:43.175
