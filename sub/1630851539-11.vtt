WEBVTT

00:03.071 --> 00:05.073
We're getting out of here.
I knew you would come for me.

00:06.274 --> 00:07.575
What the hell?

00:16.684 --> 00:18.386
Jenny: These kids are
at the center of everything.

00:18.419 --> 00:20.354
Their testimony
gets me close to an arrest.

00:20.388 --> 00:23.391
T-Lock taking that money
is a serious problem,

00:23.424 --> 00:25.759
and the cartel is not gonna stop
until they find him.

00:25.793 --> 00:27.328
We are not
setting up shop here.

00:27.361 --> 00:29.063
Why don't I call Dad,

00:29.097 --> 00:30.764
walk him through the numbers,
see what he thinks.

00:30.798 --> 00:32.166
Wouldn't do that.

00:32.200 --> 00:33.534
Why? You afraid
it's a good idea?

00:33.567 --> 00:35.203
She's not gonna like you going
behind her back.

00:35.236 --> 00:37.571
Welcome to Montana, Dad.
I have a plan.

00:37.605 --> 00:39.873
We build a manufacturing
and distribution hub

00:39.907 --> 00:42.510
right here in Helena.
Very good, Jagat.

00:42.543 --> 00:44.578
I told you I can't shake
the feeling that Wolf Legarski

00:44.612 --> 00:46.547
is connected to Ronald.
Wolf's ranch, where is it?

00:46.580 --> 00:48.616
Lindor: This isn't gonna be
a friendly visit.

00:50.218 --> 00:51.385
Where is he?

00:51.419 --> 00:53.687
If you want my help
finding him,

00:53.721 --> 00:56.690
you can start
by lowering your weapons.

00:56.724 --> 00:58.392
How 'bout you tell me
where my money is first?

00:58.426 --> 01:00.228
T-Lock has it.
No need to get our hands dirty

01:00.261 --> 01:01.862
if you let me do what I do.

01:01.895 --> 01:03.564
Mom, are you in here?!

01:04.832 --> 01:06.567
Hey, Max.
Something bad happened

01:06.600 --> 01:08.636
to my mom! I don't --

01:20.614 --> 01:22.416
Max?

01:24.452 --> 01:26.287
Rachel?

01:48.142 --> 01:50.444
Ronald do this to you?

01:50.478 --> 01:52.446
He and that...

01:52.480 --> 01:54.114
Scarlet.

01:57.951 --> 02:00.120
They killed my wife,
left me for dead.

02:00.154 --> 02:01.689
You were harboring
a fugitive.

02:01.722 --> 02:03.424
I thought I could cure him.

02:03.457 --> 02:05.526
Lindor: Cure Ronald Pergman?
You heard me,

02:05.559 --> 02:07.495
and trust me,
I know how that sounds.

02:07.528 --> 02:10.531
How did you get Ronald
in the first place?

02:10.564 --> 02:12.700
Made a deal
with the syndicate.

02:12.733 --> 02:14.768
Your brother worked with them.
Yes, he did.

02:14.802 --> 02:17.137
And it wasn't easy

02:17.171 --> 02:19.340
getting them
to let me have Ronald.

02:19.373 --> 02:21.809
I had to make
certain assurances.

02:21.842 --> 02:23.977
Why?
Why would you do that?

02:24.011 --> 02:26.380
I thought I could purge the
evil, undo what my brother did.

02:26.414 --> 02:28.549
Rick Legarski
didn't make Ronald.

02:28.582 --> 02:30.684
He stood by.

02:30.718 --> 02:31.985
He encouraged.

02:32.019 --> 02:34.154
Yeah.
I'm calling this in.

02:34.188 --> 02:37.124
What if I could, uh,
help you find him?

02:37.157 --> 02:38.526
We don't need your help.

02:38.559 --> 02:40.528
Yes, you do.
You just don't know it.

02:40.561 --> 02:42.630
We'll find them.
Actually, you won't.

02:42.663 --> 02:45.733
You won't find him,
not without my help.

02:45.766 --> 02:49.337
I know where he is,
where he will be,

02:49.370 --> 02:50.804
both of them --
Scarlet, too.

02:50.838 --> 02:52.640
Okay, then tell us.

02:52.673 --> 02:54.074
Cassie, we're wasting our time.
He's playing games.

02:54.107 --> 02:56.244
I don't play games.

02:56.277 --> 02:57.811
Yeah, nevertheless,
I'm gonna call in the truck

02:57.845 --> 02:58.979
and put out an APB.

02:59.012 --> 03:00.214
Alright, go ahead.

03:00.248 --> 03:01.515
Ronald, I'm sure,

03:01.549 --> 03:03.016
will do what Ronald
does best,

03:03.050 --> 03:07.020
and he will never, ever
be caught by you

03:07.054 --> 03:08.856
if he thinks you're onto him.

03:08.889 --> 03:10.858
You said he was wounded?

03:10.891 --> 03:13.394
Badly, possibly mortally.

03:13.427 --> 03:16.230
But Scarlet
won't let him die.

03:16.264 --> 03:17.765
I'm sure of that.

03:17.798 --> 03:19.333
So go ahead. Look around.

03:19.367 --> 03:21.935
Find your little hair fibers.
Chat with me.

03:21.969 --> 03:23.671
I won't give you anything.

03:23.704 --> 03:25.205
What do you want?

03:25.239 --> 03:26.407
Cassie.
No, I want to hear this.

03:26.440 --> 03:27.508
What do you want?

03:27.541 --> 03:30.411
One --

03:30.444 --> 03:32.580
I want complete immunity

03:32.613 --> 03:34.615
for all the charges
you're gonna threaten me with.

03:35.916 --> 03:37.685
And two...

03:40.921 --> 03:44.024
...help me bury my wife.

03:44.057 --> 03:48.529
And then I will take you
to get Ronald.

03:54.302 --> 03:56.236
Bob: Come on. Keep going.
One at a time.

03:56.270 --> 03:58.038
Down we go.

03:58.071 --> 03:59.573
Max: We don't have the drugs
or the money,

03:59.607 --> 04:01.409
if that's
what you're after.

04:11.519 --> 04:12.786
No, no. Don't touch her.
No!

04:12.820 --> 04:14.087
Back!
No, don't touch her. Don't --

04:14.121 --> 04:15.289
Come.
Please, please, please,

04:15.323 --> 04:16.657
please don't hurt her, please!
Come on.

04:16.690 --> 04:19.126
Oh. Please. Please.
You, sit!

04:19.159 --> 04:20.561
Please don't.
Put your feet
through those loops.

04:20.594 --> 04:22.129
Put your hands through
those ones.

04:22.162 --> 04:23.831
Do it.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.135
No.

04:29.337 --> 04:30.838
No, no!

04:37.978 --> 04:39.680
Where the hell are we?

04:39.713 --> 04:41.014
Hey!
Max.

04:41.048 --> 04:42.983
Answer me!
Max!

04:43.016 --> 04:45.018
Hell is a teenage girl,
am I right?

04:47.321 --> 04:49.690
I got a whole selection of
family-friendly viewing options

04:49.723 --> 04:50.624
for you both.

04:50.658 --> 04:52.793
Got "Dick Van Dyke,"

04:52.826 --> 04:55.829
"Duck Dynasty,"
"Wonder Years."

04:55.863 --> 04:57.765
Shouldn't be too bad.

05:09.042 --> 05:11.845
Wait. Wait, please, please,
please, please let us go.

05:11.879 --> 05:14.482
Child:
<i>A haircut, I think.</i>
I can't do that.

05:14.515 --> 05:16.450
Now, if your boyfriend shows up
with what he's supposed to,

05:16.484 --> 05:17.951
then we can talk.

05:17.985 --> 05:21.655
But until then,
happy watching.

05:21.689 --> 05:23.156
No!
No, please.

05:25.058 --> 05:27.495
Please!

05:58.291 --> 06:01.562
Oh, bravo, bravo!

06:04.532 --> 06:07.034
It's not the end
of the song.

06:07.067 --> 06:08.736
Dissolves with the E.

06:08.769 --> 06:11.338
Things can be imperfect
and still be beautiful.

06:11.371 --> 06:12.840
Can't they, Veer?

06:12.873 --> 06:13.874
No, he's right.

06:13.907 --> 06:16.076
Too much rubato. Yep.

06:16.109 --> 06:18.612
She used to play it perfectly.

06:18.646 --> 06:20.448
Perhaps you should
practice more.

06:20.481 --> 06:21.849
Jag: Dad.

06:21.882 --> 06:23.116
Ren's boyfriend, Stone,
is here.

06:23.150 --> 06:25.252
Says he needs to talk.

06:25.285 --> 06:27.020
Stone?
Vetted.

06:27.054 --> 06:28.889
New head
of distribution.

06:28.922 --> 06:30.791
Y-You pushed
Dietrich out?

06:30.824 --> 06:32.926
Not yet. Oh.

06:32.960 --> 06:34.762
Sharp knife
is the quick knife.
Mm-hmm.

06:39.467 --> 06:41.602
Stone.

06:41.635 --> 06:43.203
Jag: My father likes
information first

06:43.236 --> 06:44.472
and pleasantries later.

06:44.505 --> 06:46.707
Okay, well,
here's some information.

06:46.740 --> 06:48.809
I got all of Dietrich's
distributors -- all of them --

06:48.842 --> 06:50.744
to play ball.

06:50.778 --> 06:52.312
Have we met somewhere
before?

06:54.314 --> 06:55.783
No, sir.
No, I'd remember you.

07:09.162 --> 07:11.965
Is he going to
be okay?

07:11.999 --> 07:13.801
Of course he will.

07:13.834 --> 07:15.903
We just need to
get him some help.

07:37.891 --> 07:39.326
Am I dead?

07:39.359 --> 07:41.529
You are in a state
of liminality --

07:41.562 --> 07:43.797
neither here nor there.

07:43.831 --> 07:46.133
But you're dead.

07:46.166 --> 07:48.168
No one's ever really dead, Ronald.

07:48.201 --> 07:50.604
You of all people
should know that.

07:50.638 --> 07:52.606
What will Scarlet do
without me?

07:54.374 --> 07:56.510
That's your problem,
Ronald --

07:56.544 --> 07:58.646
too affected
by other people's opinions,

07:58.679 --> 08:00.614
especially women.

08:00.648 --> 08:02.716
It's your Achilles' heel.

08:02.750 --> 08:05.786
Starting with your mother,
those vicious teen girls,

08:05.819 --> 08:09.990
and now Scarlet,
who brings new meaning

08:10.023 --> 08:11.992
to chemical imbalance,
by the way.

08:12.025 --> 08:14.261
Don't talk about her
that way.

08:15.863 --> 08:17.965
She's a special one, Ronald.

08:17.998 --> 08:19.900
Mighty special.

08:19.933 --> 08:21.368
Do you know her secret?

08:21.401 --> 08:24.404
Whoo-oo, it's a doozy!

08:24.437 --> 08:26.239
A real lollapalooza.

08:26.273 --> 08:27.440
Hey!

08:29.242 --> 08:30.878
My brother
was just like that --

08:30.911 --> 08:32.913
a fool for love.

08:34.514 --> 08:36.416
You don't know
the first thing about love.

08:36.449 --> 08:41.221
Love is a manmade concept --

08:41.254 --> 08:46.760
a temporary rise in dopamine,
or oxytocin?

08:46.794 --> 08:48.596
I don't recall Merrilee
ever mentioning

08:48.629 --> 08:50.197
bashing my head in
with a hammer

08:50.230 --> 08:52.733
during our wedding vows,
but she did.

08:52.766 --> 08:54.602
And she loved me.

08:54.635 --> 08:56.436
Or said she did.

09:01.208 --> 09:03.844
We kill the ones we love, Ronald.

09:03.877 --> 09:06.079
Sometimes literally.

09:06.113 --> 09:10.117
But you already
know that.

09:10.150 --> 09:12.219
I hope you're rotting
in hell.

09:12.252 --> 09:15.589
You'll be joining me,
any moment now.

09:19.159 --> 09:20.928
It's not so bad.

09:24.965 --> 09:26.433
Scarlet:
Ronald?

09:26.466 --> 09:28.769
Ronald? Ronald?!

09:28.802 --> 09:30.270
Ronald, I need you
to stay with me.

09:30.303 --> 09:32.472
Hey.

09:49.657 --> 09:52.559
What are you doing?
What -- What are you doing?

09:52.592 --> 09:54.895
One of the girls who found
the cartel's drugs

09:54.928 --> 09:56.930
was kidnapped tonight
with her mother --

09:56.964 --> 09:59.266
T-Lock's girlfriend.
Wait, whoa.
Slow down. What happened?

09:59.299 --> 10:01.301
I-I don't know,
but I bet the Bhullars do.

10:01.334 --> 10:02.936
I got to go in there.

10:02.970 --> 10:04.571
No, Jenny. You're not going
in there, Jenny,

10:04.604 --> 10:05.639
you understand me?
You're gonna blow my cover.

10:05.673 --> 10:07.074
Two women were kidnapped!

10:07.107 --> 10:08.141
I shouldn't even be
talking to you here,

10:08.175 --> 10:09.677
and besides, Ren and Jag,

10:09.710 --> 10:11.311
they've been in there
all night, Jenny.

10:11.344 --> 10:12.312
They couldn't have possibly
known about it.

10:14.047 --> 10:17.050
I...
Listen, I...

10:19.720 --> 10:21.588
I messed up, Jenny.

10:24.524 --> 10:25.759
T-Lock.

10:27.160 --> 10:28.662
What'd you do?

10:40.640 --> 10:42.710
♪ Insane

10:46.513 --> 10:49.883
Mm.

10:51.551 --> 10:54.855
Hey, Anita,
it's your favorite brother!

10:56.389 --> 10:59.893
♪ Ana Banana,
hooty, hooty, hada ♪

10:59.927 --> 11:02.796
♪ Hooty, booty, booty, hey!

11:02.830 --> 11:04.531
Shh!
Hey!

11:04.564 --> 11:06.700
I got presents.

11:06.734 --> 11:08.168
What did you do?

11:08.201 --> 11:09.737
Nothing.
Can I come in?

11:09.770 --> 11:11.671
You can't stay here.
But I just need a place

11:11.705 --> 11:14.341
to stay for a night or two
and then I'm gone.

11:14.374 --> 11:16.576
Hey, don't worry,
Bruce and I are cool.

11:16.609 --> 11:18.846
Says who? He's still pissed
about the turtle.

11:18.879 --> 11:22.249
Oh, my God, I-I -- I did not
kill the turtle!

11:22.282 --> 11:23.583
And the jewelry?

11:23.616 --> 11:25.652
I...I borrowed it.

11:25.685 --> 11:28.321
Mm-hmm. I'm still waiting
to get it back.

11:28.355 --> 11:29.857
That's why I brought you treats.

11:34.694 --> 11:37.664
Lotion. Just what
I've always dreamed of.

11:37.697 --> 11:39.199
Look in the bottom.

11:44.437 --> 11:45.739
Mm-hmm.

11:45.773 --> 11:48.008
That should cover
the jewelry.

11:48.041 --> 11:49.877
Okay, you can come in,

11:49.910 --> 11:52.212
but you better be gone
before Bruce gets home.

11:52.245 --> 11:53.546
Can I kiss you?
No!

11:53.580 --> 11:55.282
I love you, sister!

11:55.315 --> 11:56.950
I-I'm just gonna get something
from the car, okay?

11:56.984 --> 11:59.586
T-Lock:

12:00.988 --> 12:03.056
Tracy, just no.

12:03.090 --> 12:04.958
Hey, it's not
what you think.

12:04.992 --> 12:06.894
What I think is that looks
like an overnight bag,

12:06.927 --> 12:08.461
and I said
you can't stay.

12:08.495 --> 12:10.864
Look...
Tracy, what is going on?

12:10.898 --> 12:13.867
W-What do you mean?
I mean, last I hear,
you're living off

12:13.901 --> 12:15.135
your girlfriend in town...

12:15.168 --> 12:17.637
and all of a suddenly,
new car?

12:23.576 --> 12:24.912
Hello?

12:24.945 --> 12:26.413
I asked you a question.

12:39.092 --> 12:41.294
Tracy,
what have you done?

12:55.876 --> 12:57.811
I trusted you.

12:57.845 --> 12:59.479
I told you
T-Lock had the money,

12:59.512 --> 13:02.816
and that information
was for you and you alone.

13:02.850 --> 13:03.917
And you go
and tell Dietrich.

13:03.951 --> 13:05.819
Yeah, but I-I flipped him,

13:05.853 --> 13:08.255
and now Dietrich works with me,
okay?

13:08.288 --> 13:10.090
And we don't know
that he took anybody.

13:10.123 --> 13:11.992
Well, if it wasn't
the Bhullars,

13:12.025 --> 13:14.962
the next most likely suspect
is Dietrich.

13:14.995 --> 13:16.997
I'll talk to D. No.

13:17.030 --> 13:18.431
No, we do this together.

13:18.465 --> 13:20.133
This is not a good idea.
I'm not negotiating.

13:29.509 --> 13:31.344
What is this?
She's not part of the deal.

13:31.378 --> 13:32.779
Yeah, well,
that was before

13:32.812 --> 13:34.481
you kidnapped
T-Lock's girlfriend and her kid.

13:34.514 --> 13:35.983
I did, huh?
Cut the BS.

13:36.016 --> 13:38.351
Where are they?
Beats me.

13:41.054 --> 13:44.391
Ah, okay.
You two are gettin' after it.

13:44.424 --> 13:46.493
Isn't there some kind of
Sheriff's Department HR policy

13:46.526 --> 13:47.794
against that?

13:47.827 --> 13:49.129
You missed your shot.

13:49.162 --> 13:50.163
Just answer
my question.

13:50.197 --> 13:51.798
I don't know
what you're talking about.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.133
Did you ask
the Bhullars?

13:53.166 --> 13:54.401
They got nothing
to do with this.

13:54.434 --> 13:56.003
Well, if you say so.

13:56.036 --> 13:57.637
What about
your little pet psycho, Bob?

13:57.670 --> 13:59.006
Where's he?

13:59.039 --> 14:00.840
Bob's his own man.
Who's Bob?

14:00.874 --> 14:02.809
I don't imagine you know him.
He's shifty.

14:02.842 --> 14:04.878
Does Bob have the girls?

14:04.912 --> 14:07.214
I'd say ask him,
but finding him is the problem.

14:07.247 --> 14:08.848
Okay, you're gonna
help us with that.

14:08.882 --> 14:10.550
I think I've helped you enough.

14:10.583 --> 14:12.519
Look, if you want,
I could feed you right now

14:12.552 --> 14:14.554
to the Bhullars.
And I could do the same.

14:14.587 --> 14:16.189
Travis, outside, now.

14:22.729 --> 14:24.431
You want to tell me
about Bob?

14:26.399 --> 14:28.601
Yeah,
he's this survivalist freak

14:28.635 --> 14:30.870
that Dietrich calls in
to clean up his messes, and...

14:30.904 --> 14:32.672
the guy's a ghost, so...

14:32.705 --> 14:34.507
Does Bob know you're working
with State?

14:37.410 --> 14:39.112
Yeah.

14:40.880 --> 14:42.882
Any way to flush him out?

14:44.451 --> 14:45.852
I don't know.

14:45.885 --> 14:47.387
We should find a way
to run Dietrich in.

14:47.420 --> 14:49.056
No, that's not gonna
solve anything.

14:49.089 --> 14:51.124
And besides,
Dietrich belongs to me, okay?

14:51.158 --> 14:52.792
I need him to get
to the Bhullars.

14:52.825 --> 14:54.294
Okay, Dietrich knows
you're a cop.

14:54.327 --> 14:56.263
Bob knows you're a cop.

14:56.296 --> 14:58.598
Is there anything you want to
share about Veer Bhullar?

14:58.631 --> 15:00.233
Now would be a good time
to fill me in.

15:00.267 --> 15:01.701
I've told you everything.

15:01.734 --> 15:03.370
Yeah.

15:03.403 --> 15:06.073
Your partner.

15:06.106 --> 15:09.042
Your partner
who got killed.

15:09.076 --> 15:10.543
Tell me what happened.

15:14.247 --> 15:15.582
No, I'm not gonna
do this now, Jenny.

15:22.122 --> 15:24.257
I wish you trusted me.

15:25.993 --> 15:28.261
Just know it's not gonna stop me
from finding the girls.

15:30.263 --> 15:34.767
Max's friend, Harper --
let's go talk to her tomorrow.

15:41.774 --> 15:44.277
Scarlet:

15:57.324 --> 15:59.492
Oh, baby,
I don't know what to do.

15:59.526 --> 16:00.960
I'm right here, love.

16:02.229 --> 16:04.264
You need a doctor. No.

16:04.297 --> 16:08.601
No doctors.
I won't watch you die.

16:08.635 --> 16:09.936
I'm not gonna die.

16:12.039 --> 16:14.041
We need to ditch
the truck.

16:15.408 --> 16:16.709
No.

16:16.743 --> 16:18.378
No, we need a doctor.

16:18.411 --> 16:21.681
I'm gonna get you one.

16:24.051 --> 16:26.786
Oh, God.

16:33.826 --> 16:37.564
Dear Lord,
I don't come to you for much,

16:37.597 --> 16:44.604
and right now,
I am my most vulnerable self.

16:44.871 --> 16:47.840
No one knows more than you, Lord,

16:47.874 --> 16:52.245
how I would gladly trade places
with my dear wife

16:52.279 --> 16:54.314
in a heartbeat.

16:54.347 --> 16:59.486
Take my heartbeat
and gift it to my dead Aggie.

16:59.519 --> 17:06.526
But I do come to you
on my knees

17:07.127 --> 17:11.431
and humbly ask
that you have mercy on her soul.

17:14.301 --> 17:18.538
And that she...
is in a heaven of animals.

17:21.374 --> 17:24.777
Well, Aggie,

17:24.811 --> 17:27.914
you were right...

17:27.947 --> 17:30.583
about Ronald...

17:32.819 --> 17:39.826
about everything.

17:40.393 --> 17:43.596
And I promise you...

17:43.630 --> 17:50.637
I will do everything in my power
to undo what I have done...

17:51.771 --> 17:55.041
if it's the last thing
that I do.

18:04.016 --> 18:06.586
Do you want to
say something?

18:06.619 --> 18:08.721
We're good.

18:10.790 --> 18:13.426
Okay, tell us
where to find him.

18:13.460 --> 18:15.728
Well, it's not a where,
it's a --

18:15.762 --> 18:17.330
it's a what.

18:17.364 --> 18:20.433
Come on.

18:20.467 --> 18:25.772
I, uh, installed
a GPS microchip

18:25.805 --> 18:29.976
into Ronald just in case --
a little insurance.

18:30.009 --> 18:32.212
But I am coming with you.

18:41.154 --> 18:42.622
Do we have a deal?

18:44.624 --> 18:46.759
Okay.

18:46.793 --> 18:48.528
I'll get the scanner.

19:01.341 --> 19:02.875
Ren: It's good, right?

19:02.909 --> 19:04.211
You need to know
where to look,

19:04.244 --> 19:06.213
but this town
has hidden gems.

19:06.246 --> 19:07.614
It's passable.

19:07.647 --> 19:09.982
She's got beer taste
on a champagne budget.

19:11.418 --> 19:12.685
Ow!

19:12.719 --> 19:14.120
Where's your manners?

19:14.153 --> 19:16.055
I think it was
a joke, V.

19:16.088 --> 19:18.391
I know exactly what it was,
and I won't have it.

19:18.425 --> 19:20.327
This new generation,
no respect.

19:20.360 --> 19:24.297
Everything's a joke or TikTok
or some frivolous thing.

19:24.331 --> 19:26.999
Apologize
to your sister.

19:31.904 --> 19:34.207
I'm sorry.

19:34.241 --> 19:36.309
See?
Now we have manners.

19:36.343 --> 19:37.710
We have order.

19:37.744 --> 19:39.879
Respect for
a properly-cooked meal,

19:39.912 --> 19:42.014
respect for family.

19:42.048 --> 19:44.684
I mean, me and my sister,
we fought like crazy, too,

19:44.717 --> 19:46.018
when we were kids.

19:46.052 --> 19:48.488
But now we're best friends.

19:48.521 --> 19:51.057
Well, they were brought up
differently than you.

19:51.090 --> 19:52.592
How was I brought up?

19:52.625 --> 19:54.227
We'll talk
about this later.

19:54.261 --> 19:57.063
I'd like to hear
how you think I was brought up.

19:57.096 --> 19:59.566
I said later.

19:59.599 --> 20:01.768
We have business to discuss.

20:01.801 --> 20:03.270
I'm not leaving.

20:03.303 --> 20:06.506
No, of course not,
but you will be quiet

20:06.539 --> 20:10.510
and respectful and keep
your opinions to yourself.

20:10.543 --> 20:12.245
Can I chew?

20:15.482 --> 20:18.184
Alicia has been helping me
with my financial planning,

20:18.217 --> 20:20.453
among other things. Ah.

20:20.487 --> 20:24.791
Now, Jagat is going to need
some extra hands.

20:24.824 --> 20:27.193
For what, exactly?

20:27.226 --> 20:28.561
I'll let him tell you.

20:28.595 --> 20:30.963
Uh, y-yeah.

20:30.997 --> 20:34.534
Uh, I thought
that it might be good for the --

20:34.567 --> 20:38.204
the family to have some assets
here in Helena.

20:38.237 --> 20:40.807
Um, uh,
open up manufacturing,

20:40.840 --> 20:43.242
set up shop,
go direct to market.

20:43.276 --> 20:48.581
Plus, uh, zero problems
with border patrol.

20:48.615 --> 20:51.651
Reenu,
what do you think?

20:51.684 --> 20:55.488
Sounds like
an incredible idea, Dad.

20:55.522 --> 20:58.124
Thank you.
Surprised you thought of it yourself.

20:58.157 --> 21:00.927
Tell me,
what happens next?

21:02.362 --> 21:03.763
What do you mean?

21:03.796 --> 21:06.899
Once you set up shop,
what's your next move?

21:06.933 --> 21:08.935
Uh...

21:08.968 --> 21:11.438
Come on,
give us a little hint.

21:11.471 --> 21:14.073
Yeah, I'd like
to hear, too.

21:16.376 --> 21:19.512
Well, um, you know,
my plan's always evolving.

21:19.546 --> 21:21.914
Uh, it's --
it's really complicated, and --

21:21.948 --> 21:24.584
and you got zig when they zag,
Dad, so...

21:24.617 --> 21:26.753
Is that
a technical term?

21:26.786 --> 21:29.322
No.
No?

21:29.356 --> 21:31.458
Want to explain it to us?

21:34.160 --> 21:36.696
If I may -- and I'm guessing,
of course --

21:36.729 --> 21:38.297
but I would assume
that you want to replicate

21:38.331 --> 21:40.367
the Helena operation
in Phoenix, in Cleveland,

21:40.400 --> 21:43.135
and beyond, creating
a hub-and-spoke model,

21:43.169 --> 21:45.505
reducing risk
and distribution costs

21:45.538 --> 21:48.107
by limiting the distance,
so if one operation goes down,

21:48.140 --> 21:51.544
then the other remains untouched.

21:51.578 --> 21:54.180
Like independent silos?

21:56.583 --> 21:58.050
Oops.

21:58.084 --> 21:59.719
I have thoughts.

21:59.752 --> 22:02.021
Yes, actually. But that's
just what I'm assuming,

22:02.054 --> 22:04.156
if it had been my idea.

22:10.497 --> 22:11.964
I can't believe
someone took Max.

22:11.998 --> 22:12.999
You guys should be
looking for her

22:13.032 --> 22:14.667
instead of talking to me.

22:14.701 --> 22:16.302
Jenny:
We need some help.

22:16.335 --> 22:18.405
Try to remember everything
Max told you about T-Lock.

22:18.438 --> 22:22.241
Look, even the most
insignificant detail,

22:22.274 --> 22:23.643
it could help us find
your friend, okay?

22:25.412 --> 22:28.648
Um... Max just thought
he was a loser.

22:28.681 --> 22:30.983
He just would sit on the couch
all day,

22:31.017 --> 22:34.220
and he was always going on and
on about his protein smoothies.

22:34.253 --> 22:35.321
Did he have
a part-time job,

22:35.354 --> 22:37.223
or have any friends
that would,

22:37.256 --> 22:39.559
you know,
stop by on the reg?

22:39.592 --> 22:44.664
I think he used to be a roofer
or something.

22:44.697 --> 22:47.434
Oh, and I know before Rachel,
he was living with his sister.

22:47.467 --> 22:50.937
Max had to go there once.

22:50.970 --> 22:52.672
Do you know
his sister's name?

22:55.575 --> 22:58.445
No.
No, I don't remember.

22:58.478 --> 22:59.946
It's okay.

22:59.979 --> 23:01.881
You've been
very helpful.

23:01.914 --> 23:03.750
Is Max gonna be okay?

23:05.552 --> 23:07.520
We're gonna do
everything we can.

23:11.724 --> 23:14.060
What were you thinking?
You should've come to me.

23:14.093 --> 23:16.529
Didn't realize
I needed to ask permission.

23:16.563 --> 23:19.065
I've got cops crawling
up my ass.

23:19.098 --> 23:20.467
It's easy to crawl
up your ass

23:20.500 --> 23:23.903
when you're already
in bed together.

23:23.936 --> 23:25.204
Working with Stone
is the only way

23:25.237 --> 23:27.440
I'm gonna get out
of this alive.

23:27.474 --> 23:29.709
Now, this may be a foreign
concept to you,

23:29.742 --> 23:31.644
but you need to work smarter,
not harder,

23:31.678 --> 23:34.113
with the Bhullars.
You hired me
to get your money back.

23:34.146 --> 23:36.449
That's what I'm doing.
I hired you to take
the heat off of me,

23:36.483 --> 23:38.551
and you are doing
the exact opposite.

23:38.585 --> 23:39.752
Now, how the hell did you even
get ahold of T-Lock?

23:39.786 --> 23:41.087
I thought he ditched
his phone.

23:41.120 --> 23:42.254
Friend of mine works
for a dealership

23:42.288 --> 23:44.090
where he just purchased
a fancy new vehicle.

23:44.123 --> 23:46.559
Used his burner phone
for registration.

23:46.593 --> 23:49.762
You better hope that's
where his spending spree ended.

23:49.796 --> 23:54.333
I think that you are forgetting
you take orders from me.

23:54.366 --> 23:58.971
Hmm.
From now on,
you stay in line.

23:59.005 --> 24:02.108
Or what?

24:02.141 --> 24:03.776
You know what?

24:03.810 --> 24:06.012
I think
I just raised my prices.

24:06.045 --> 24:07.780
I'm gonna be keeping
any money that I find.

24:09.716 --> 24:10.750
Like hell you will.

24:16.989 --> 24:19.526
I don't take orders from people
that I don't respect.

24:19.559 --> 24:22.161
What makes you think your plan
will even work?

24:22.194 --> 24:24.330
Well, if not, I'll keep
the girlfriend.

24:24.363 --> 24:26.032
She smells good.

24:26.065 --> 24:28.635
It'd be nice to have a woman's
touch around the house.

24:32.805 --> 24:34.140
Cactus in the window.
Nice touch.

24:34.173 --> 24:36.509
Mm.
Anything?

24:36.543 --> 24:39.512
T-Lock's got a sister.
Run her down.
On it.

24:39.546 --> 24:42.348
Hey, good work in there, okay?
Keep me posted.

24:42.381 --> 24:44.984
Wait, where are you going?

24:45.017 --> 24:46.352
Just gonna check in
with my handler.

24:46.385 --> 24:48.020
Now?
Yeah.

24:48.054 --> 24:50.523
Let me know if anything comes
of the sister, okay?

24:50.557 --> 24:54.060
Sure. I wouldn't want you to
feel left out of the loop.

24:54.093 --> 24:55.995
Hoyt.

25:02.602 --> 25:04.804
Men.

25:04.837 --> 25:06.673
So, where'd you get it?

25:09.075 --> 25:10.710
I...found it.

25:10.743 --> 25:11.811
Yeah, right.

25:11.844 --> 25:13.412
I didn't steal it.

25:13.445 --> 25:18.317
It kind of sort of came
into my possession.

25:18.350 --> 25:21.220
Okay, Tracy, I really don't have
time for all your BS.

25:21.253 --> 25:23.255
You'd already be in Cancun
if this was easy money.

25:23.289 --> 25:25.592
I told you,
they have Rachel and Maxie.

25:25.625 --> 25:28.060
What...

25:28.094 --> 25:29.762
So, what are you going
to do?

25:34.100 --> 25:36.669
Um...

25:36.703 --> 25:38.037
Call the police?

25:40.539 --> 25:42.008
That's a lot of money.

25:42.041 --> 25:45.044
You sure
that's the way to go?

25:45.077 --> 25:47.079
Yeah.

25:47.113 --> 25:50.449
Yeah, 'cause t-they'll see that
I'm doing the right thing,

25:50.482 --> 25:52.184
and then --
and then they'll try to help me.

25:52.218 --> 25:53.452
Wha--

25:53.485 --> 25:55.454
You have an opportunity.

25:55.487 --> 25:57.456
You can use this money
to start over.

26:03.229 --> 26:05.464
Or you can go to jail.
You might even be good at that.

26:05.497 --> 26:06.866
You don't understand.

26:06.899 --> 26:08.300
These men
are going to hurt them.

26:08.334 --> 26:09.568
Then give them the money,

26:09.602 --> 26:11.303
but leave me out of it.
Hey, what are you doing?

26:11.337 --> 26:12.739
You already spent
some of it on your car.

26:12.772 --> 26:15.274
Hey, give me that!
Ana!

26:17.777 --> 26:21.080
<i>En garde! En garde!</i>

26:21.113 --> 26:22.481
<i>Don't you want to fight?</i>

26:22.514 --> 26:23.549
<i>No, we don't want
to fight!</i>

26:31.791 --> 26:34.460
Who is that?
Huh?

26:34.493 --> 26:36.328
That person over there.

26:38.030 --> 26:40.432
Well, I am flattered
that you thought he was real.

26:40.466 --> 26:42.769
You know, you see,
I find that people

26:42.802 --> 26:45.905
are often the worst-case
scenario, so instead...

26:48.174 --> 26:49.608
I make wooden friends.

26:49.642 --> 26:51.510
I call him Fred.

26:51.543 --> 26:53.479
Okay.

26:53.512 --> 26:56.582
The world is a cruel place.

26:56.615 --> 27:00.687
What we need is a return
to a simpler time.

27:00.720 --> 27:03.690
You know, I'm just trying
to bring a little order

27:03.723 --> 27:06.525
to a chaotic world.

27:06.558 --> 27:08.594
Does holding us hostage

27:08.627 --> 27:11.030
align with your idea
of a simpler time?

27:11.063 --> 27:13.265
That all depends
on T-Lock.

27:13.299 --> 27:14.366
Now, hopefully,
he does the right thing.

27:14.400 --> 27:16.769
I can let you go.

27:16.803 --> 27:18.705
And if he doesn't?

27:21.674 --> 27:23.542
Anarchy.

27:28.014 --> 27:29.949
He's insane.

27:33.720 --> 27:35.354
Mom.

27:35.387 --> 27:37.556
Look, over there.

27:37.589 --> 27:39.325
If I can get my hands
on something sharp,

27:39.358 --> 27:41.460
then I can get us
out of here.

27:44.831 --> 27:46.833
<i>Oh!</i>

27:48.200 --> 27:49.468
<i>Ow!</i>

28:03.883 --> 28:05.517
What in the hell is this?

28:05.551 --> 28:07.319
Well, I didn't know
you were coming,

28:07.353 --> 28:10.622
so I wasn't prepared
to make chai.

28:12.358 --> 28:14.660
Almond? Oat?

28:14.693 --> 28:16.095
I prefer cream.

28:16.128 --> 28:17.864
Your heart doesn't.

28:17.897 --> 28:19.999
Funny.

28:22.468 --> 28:25.872
Quite the show you put on
with your brother.

28:25.905 --> 28:27.706
His formula for success
seems to be

28:27.740 --> 28:29.909
skirting all of the work
and taking all of the credit.

28:29.942 --> 28:31.277
It's not a good look.

28:31.310 --> 28:33.780
Beti,
I know it was your idea.

28:35.147 --> 28:36.448
It was.

28:36.482 --> 28:37.649
It's a good idea.

28:40.953 --> 28:43.289
But?
There's always a "but."

28:43.322 --> 28:46.458
You're not ready
to lead the family.

28:48.160 --> 28:50.462
Who says I want to lead
the family?

28:50.496 --> 28:52.698
You're not a good liar, Reenu.

28:52.731 --> 28:54.033
Never have been.

28:54.066 --> 28:56.468
So I'm not ready,
but Jag is?

28:56.502 --> 28:59.471
Let's not forget why you were
sent here in the first place --

28:59.505 --> 29:02.909
to recover the missing drugs
and money, and somehow,

29:02.942 --> 29:05.978
you have failed to complete
that tiny little task.

29:06.012 --> 29:07.479
But it's a good idea.

29:07.513 --> 29:09.315
Yeah, I said that already.

29:09.348 --> 29:11.951
Is that what you want --
compliments?

29:11.984 --> 29:15.187
They make you weak.

29:19.758 --> 29:22.661
Jagat is your baby brother,
your blood.

29:22.694 --> 29:25.331
When this cream kills me, he'll
be all you got in the world.

29:27.800 --> 29:30.102
Jagat will lead
the new enterprise,

29:30.136 --> 29:32.404
and you will finish
what you started.

29:32.438 --> 29:35.842
Do I make myself clear?

29:35.875 --> 29:37.409
Yes.

29:39.345 --> 29:41.713
Good. Ah.

29:44.450 --> 29:47.586
Oh, and one other thing --

29:47.619 --> 29:49.956
you should've told me
about the new hire.

29:49.989 --> 29:51.523
Stone. Yep, he's solid.

29:51.557 --> 29:53.192
He helped us
get the drugs back.

29:53.225 --> 29:56.128
Yeah, I don't care if you think
he hung the moon.

29:56.162 --> 29:58.998
Do not undermine
my authority.

29:59.031 --> 30:01.968
I do my own due diligence. Understood.

30:02.001 --> 30:06.005
And if we do hire this Stone,
Dietrich needs to be handled.

30:06.038 --> 30:08.507
He knows too much,
which makes him a loose end.

30:08.540 --> 30:10.476
You'll tie that up for me.

30:11.911 --> 30:13.545
Of course.

30:32.764 --> 30:35.334
Nice wheels.
Think it's T-Lock's?

30:35.367 --> 30:36.903
Money burning up a hole
in his pockets?

30:36.936 --> 30:38.570
Only one way to find out.

30:45.011 --> 30:46.645
Hands!

30:46.678 --> 30:48.547
Drop the bag, Tracy!

30:48.580 --> 30:51.383
Hey, easy, it's -- it's all
a huge misunderstanding.

30:51.417 --> 30:53.552
I actually was gonna
turn myself in.

30:53.585 --> 30:56.555
Then you'll have no problem
driving to the station with us.

30:56.588 --> 30:58.057
Search him.

31:20.112 --> 31:22.081
This a good time?
Nope.

31:25.084 --> 31:27.286
Well, you look serious.
What's up, cowboy?

31:27.319 --> 31:29.922
Dietrich figured out
who took your money.

31:29.956 --> 31:31.757
I'm listening.
It's a guy named T-Lock.

31:31.790 --> 31:33.792
But he -- he skipped town.

31:33.825 --> 31:36.095
But now this goblin
who works for Dietrich,

31:36.128 --> 31:39.398
he might've kidnapped T-Lock's
girlfriend and her daughter.

31:39.431 --> 31:41.033
Oof, sounds like a mess.

31:41.067 --> 31:42.901
I don't like
to involve families, Ren.

31:42.935 --> 31:44.570
And he's got
a bleeding heart.

31:44.603 --> 31:47.473
I know you have the resources
to find these women

31:47.506 --> 31:49.641
a hell of a lot more than
the Sheriff's Department does.

31:49.675 --> 31:51.978
Of course I do, but I can't
help them, not right now. Sorry.

31:52.011 --> 31:54.713
Ren, if you find them,
they will lead you

31:54.746 --> 31:57.749
straight to your money.
You will be made whole.

31:57.783 --> 32:00.052
True.

32:00.086 --> 32:03.555
Ooh, this might be
a win-win for both of us.

32:03.589 --> 32:06.492
I'm up to my ears right now
in family politics.

32:06.525 --> 32:08.494
Not gonna get into it.

32:08.527 --> 32:10.429
Cliff Notes are
that I don't have the bandwidth

32:10.462 --> 32:13.665
for extracurriculars,
and you might be out of a job.

32:13.699 --> 32:16.168
What?
I like having pretty things

32:16.202 --> 32:18.504
around to look at,
but my dad likes to vet people

32:18.537 --> 32:20.306
on his own, so you gotta
get in good with him

32:20.339 --> 32:22.608
or you're out.
But I haven't
even started, Ren.

32:22.641 --> 32:27.079
I know. The quickest way to
re-entry is to get that money.

32:27.113 --> 32:31.250
If I knew where T-Lock was, Ren,
I wouldn't need your help.

32:31.283 --> 32:33.619
But you are
very resourceful.

32:33.652 --> 32:35.988
Mm-hmm.

32:36.022 --> 32:37.856
And if you succeed,
then you save those women

32:37.889 --> 32:41.593
and you are officially
in the house of Bhullar,

32:41.627 --> 32:43.662
which I would love.

32:43.695 --> 32:46.498
Win-win.

32:55.141 --> 32:57.676
You know if I kiss you,
I got to kill you, right?

33:00.379 --> 33:03.782
Might be worth it.

33:19.365 --> 33:21.033
Phoebe: What are you
waiting for, Mom?

33:22.768 --> 33:26.738
Do you remember why we went to
live in that cabin together?

33:26.772 --> 33:28.240
Away from everything?

33:28.274 --> 33:29.908
You told me it was because
Ronald was afraid

33:29.941 --> 33:31.743
of other people. Yeah.

33:31.777 --> 33:34.012
But I don't believe you.

33:34.046 --> 33:36.548
Well, it's true, Phoebe.

33:36.582 --> 33:38.217
And if we go into
that busy hospital,

33:38.250 --> 33:39.718
it could do him more harm
than good.

33:39.751 --> 33:42.388
It could scare him
to death.

33:42.421 --> 33:44.556
Then how is he going to
get better?

33:45.924 --> 33:47.559
Um...

33:47.593 --> 33:48.894
A doctor.

33:52.064 --> 33:54.233
I think what Ronald needs

33:54.266 --> 33:57.536
is to be cared for
in private.

34:13.119 --> 34:16.355
You know,
it's really unnecessary

34:16.388 --> 34:18.190
for me to be restrained
like this.

34:18.224 --> 34:21.893
I'm a wounded man in the custody
of a P.I. and a US Marshal.

34:21.927 --> 34:24.396
Redundancy is the word
that comes to mind.

34:24.430 --> 34:25.697
I don't trust you.

34:25.731 --> 34:27.233
Well, I accept that,
but you'll see

34:27.266 --> 34:29.067
I'm a man of my word, Marshal.

34:29.101 --> 34:31.403
Yeah, how about you just focus
on Ronald's movements?

34:31.437 --> 34:32.871
Oh, we're not
in range yet.

34:32.904 --> 34:34.940
Well, that means
he's long gone.

34:34.973 --> 34:38.277
What you should be worried about
is Ms. Dewell and that gun.

34:38.310 --> 34:40.279
One bump in the road and pop,
I'll be dead

34:40.312 --> 34:41.747
and you'll have to clean up
brain matter,

34:41.780 --> 34:44.716
and neither of us
wants that.

34:44.750 --> 34:46.485
I am your ally in this.

34:46.518 --> 34:48.420
We'll see about that.

34:48.454 --> 34:49.821
Why don't you tell me about
the deal you made

34:49.855 --> 34:51.157
with the syndicate?

34:51.190 --> 34:52.258
I don't think
you want to know.

34:52.291 --> 34:54.092
No, I do, actually.

34:56.795 --> 34:58.564
After I was done
with my little experiment,

34:58.597 --> 35:01.099
I was supposed to
give him back.

35:01.133 --> 35:02.668
So they could kill him?

35:02.701 --> 35:04.136
I imagine so.

35:04.170 --> 35:05.971
He was a liability.

35:06.004 --> 35:07.439
I'd hoped
he'd turn himself in.

35:07.473 --> 35:09.441
That's what you thought
would happen?

35:09.475 --> 35:12.611
How many books have you written
on the cognitive

35:12.644 --> 35:14.480
and behavioral dysfunction
in mammals

35:14.513 --> 35:15.947
and its rehabilitation?

35:15.981 --> 35:17.783
My guess
is exactly zero.

35:17.816 --> 35:20.519
My father's dead
because of you!

35:22.688 --> 35:25.123
Yeah.

35:25.157 --> 35:27.125
I guess I believed
there'd be good in everybody,

35:27.159 --> 35:29.195
even Ronald.

35:29.228 --> 35:31.797
I made a mistake.

35:31.830 --> 35:33.365
And I'm sorry.

35:33.399 --> 35:36.668
And I know that doesn't bring
your father back

35:36.702 --> 35:39.338
or my Aggie.

35:39.371 --> 35:42.841
And like I said,
I'm gonna fix it.

35:42.874 --> 35:44.510
You talk too much.

35:44.543 --> 35:46.144
Hmm.

35:46.178 --> 35:51.116
I just --
can I ask you one question?

35:51.149 --> 35:53.151
How did it feel to shoot
my brother in the head?

35:53.185 --> 35:54.786
Okay,
let's focus on the map.
I'm only asking

35:54.820 --> 35:56.154
because I always wondered
how it would feel

35:56.188 --> 35:58.023
to shoot --
Lindor's right.

35:58.056 --> 36:01.827
Be quiet.

36:01.860 --> 36:04.196
Bingo.

36:04.230 --> 36:07.199
Five miles off the main road
at a hospital nearby.

36:07.233 --> 36:09.735
Or at least that's
his most recent location.

36:17.243 --> 36:20.812
Okay. And now I just gotta
get these zip-ties off.

36:26.418 --> 36:28.587
Okay.

36:31.623 --> 36:33.659
You got it, baby.

36:35.093 --> 36:36.762
I got it!

36:36.795 --> 36:38.864
I got it!
Oh! Okay,
be careful, baby.

36:38.897 --> 36:40.399
I'll be careful, okay?

36:40.432 --> 36:43.435
Okay, okay.
I can't watch.

36:43.469 --> 36:48.440
Come on.

36:55.414 --> 36:56.782
I did it, I did it!

36:56.815 --> 36:58.617
Shh! Hurry up.

36:58.650 --> 37:00.051
Get mine, too.

37:00.085 --> 37:01.920
Okay, okay, okay.

37:03.989 --> 37:07.225
Shh!

37:07.259 --> 37:08.894
Shh. You got it, you got it, baby,

37:08.927 --> 37:11.530
you got it, baby,
you got it.

37:11.563 --> 37:13.299
You got it.
You got it, baby.

37:13.332 --> 37:14.733
Okay.

37:14.766 --> 37:16.067
Shh.

37:18.069 --> 37:19.305
Shh. Hurry up.
Hurry up.

37:19.338 --> 37:21.106
Okay. Okay, careful.

37:21.139 --> 37:23.575
Got it.

37:25.677 --> 37:27.212
He's coming.

37:30.349 --> 37:31.650
Hide.

37:36.154 --> 37:39.325
Hey, ladies,
I was thinking that --

37:39.358 --> 37:40.659
What the hell?

37:44.963 --> 37:46.765
Hurry up, hurry up,
hurry up!

37:46.798 --> 37:49.801
Hurry up!
Ah! Okay!

37:49.835 --> 37:52.438
No, no, no, no, no, no!
Don't hurt her!

37:52.471 --> 37:54.340
Aah! No, Maxie!

37:54.373 --> 37:56.642
No! No!

37:56.675 --> 37:58.744
Aah!

37:58.777 --> 38:01.279
Oh, Maxie!

38:01.313 --> 38:02.981
Hey!

38:06.184 --> 38:08.520
Max, run! Run!
Get help!

38:16.362 --> 38:19.030
Max! Max!

38:45.023 --> 38:47.826
Hey.
Stay with me, baby.

39:05.544 --> 39:07.513
Do I keep him on the line
for as long as possible,

39:07.546 --> 39:08.847
like in the movies?

39:08.880 --> 39:10.482
Poppernak:
That's not a thing.

39:10.516 --> 39:11.750
The moment you pick up,
we'll have what we need.

39:11.783 --> 39:14.252
He should've called by now.
Something's not right.

39:14.285 --> 39:16.388
God, just please let me know
they're okay.

39:27.899 --> 39:29.401
Hello?

39:29.435 --> 39:32.504
Bob: <i>4212 Mission Street
parking structure.</i>

39:32.538 --> 39:34.540
<i>Bring the bag --
tomorrow, 4:30 p.m.</i>

39:34.573 --> 39:36.742
Understood.

39:36.775 --> 39:38.844
What is it?

39:38.877 --> 39:40.746
He's using
a virtual location tool.

39:40.779 --> 39:42.247
Some type of call masking,

39:42.280 --> 39:44.049
lets you manually choose
a location.

39:44.082 --> 39:46.918
Says he traveled from Missoula
to Jersey on this phone call.

39:46.952 --> 39:49.054
Think he's on to us?

39:49.087 --> 39:51.690
We need to be careful.

39:51.723 --> 39:53.625
Let's get you prepped.
You're up.

40:03.669 --> 40:05.403
Sweetie.

40:05.437 --> 40:07.238
Can you do me
a little favor?

40:07.272 --> 40:10.241
Say a prayer for Ronald,
will you?

40:10.275 --> 40:11.610
Heavenly Father --

40:11.643 --> 40:13.211
Close your eyes.

40:13.244 --> 40:16.214
Tightly.

40:16.247 --> 40:19.050
Heavenly Father,
please bless Ronald

40:19.084 --> 40:21.787
and make him feel better.

40:21.820 --> 40:25.491
And watch over me and my mom
so that we're never separated

40:25.524 --> 40:28.627
ever again, and hopefully,
we get to go home soon.

40:28.660 --> 40:30.328
Thank you.

40:30.361 --> 40:32.664
Amen.

40:36.267 --> 40:39.605
Good.

40:39.638 --> 40:41.807
Okay.

40:41.840 --> 40:44.743
It's okay.

40:44.776 --> 40:48.179
Take a second.

40:51.883 --> 40:54.319
Good. Okay.

40:54.352 --> 40:55.787
Lean here.

40:55.821 --> 40:58.089
You got it.

40:58.123 --> 40:59.457
Okay.

41:10.035 --> 41:11.603
Hi.
Dr. Cowley: Yes?

41:11.637 --> 41:13.639
I-I'm so sorry
to barge in here,

41:13.672 --> 41:14.973
but my husband,
he was attacked.

41:15.006 --> 41:16.307
Attacked?
Yes.

41:16.341 --> 41:17.876
How?
It was
a random attack.

41:17.909 --> 41:19.277
You need to take him
to the emergency room.

41:19.310 --> 41:21.346
No, no, there's no time.

41:21.379 --> 41:23.815
H-He's bleeding.
He's bleeding a lot, so --

41:23.849 --> 41:25.551
so I need you to help us, please.

41:25.584 --> 41:28.554
You're a doctor, right?
Ronald: I can't breathe.

41:28.587 --> 41:31.122
I-I'm sorry,
who are you?

41:31.156 --> 41:32.958
I-I'm Marie.

41:32.991 --> 41:35.160
I tried -- I tried to stop
the bleeding,

41:35.193 --> 41:36.828
but I-I can't really
get it to --
Okay, okay, Marie.

41:36.862 --> 41:38.163
Marie, let me just grab
my keys,

41:38.196 --> 41:39.565
and we can go
to the hospital.

41:39.598 --> 41:41.833
No, no, no, no,
you need to help us now.

41:41.867 --> 41:44.002
Look, I'm sorry.
My house is under construction.

41:44.035 --> 41:46.204
I can't do anything
for you in here.

41:46.237 --> 41:48.540
I'm not sure
that you heard me.

41:48.574 --> 41:50.375
No hospital.

41:50.408 --> 41:52.944
You fix him right here,
right now!

42:32.550 --> 42:34.452
