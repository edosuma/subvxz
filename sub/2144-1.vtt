I was born as a wild dog
and raised as a monster.

01:24.810 --> 01:29.660
<i>BEEP A CAPE, NORTH KOREA</i>

01:32.820 --> 01:35.560
No military band to cheer my battle.

01:37.060 --> 01:41.370
Guess it's true nobody knows
about our troop's existence.

01:44.130 --> 01:46.810
Five minutes more. And I am going out.

01:57.510 --> 01:58.460
Lieutenant WON.

01:58.780 --> 02:02.860
Yes, 98-0075. Lieutenant WON Ryu-hwan!

02:04.450 --> 02:07.560
Hold! We'll meet again
only in two conditions.

02:08.530 --> 02:11.630
Either as brothers
when we achieve re-unification,

02:11.800 --> 02:15.740
or as enemies

02:17.830 --> 02:19.680
to kill each other.

02:20.670 --> 02:21.650
I'll tell you only one thing.

02:25.840 --> 02:26.880
Stay alive.

02:27.710 --> 02:28.880
Now he tells me to stay alive?

02:29.980 --> 02:32.650
After he tried to kill me
900 times during 9 years.

02:33.750 --> 02:37.700
Stay alive to witness the glory of the nation.

02:40.760 --> 02:42.760
But if you have to die,

02:45.560 --> 02:47.600
die as a legend.

03:05.550 --> 03:06.550
I never avoid

03:07.050 --> 03:11.400

03:12.860 --> 03:14.360
Terrain features understanding completed.

03:14.960 --> 03:17.770
It's thrown. Judging from the sound...

03:18.090 --> 03:20.400
It's 150 mm in diameter and 400 grams.

03:21.730 --> 03:22.400
And it's a pebble.

03:25.600 --> 03:25.910
Yes!

03:30.910 --> 03:33.050
Eat that, you stupid idiot.

03:34.710 --> 03:37.950
Sons of bitch! I'll eat you alive sometime.

03:39.380 --> 03:41.830
Don't mess with us, idiot!

03:42.550 --> 03:45.360
Let me buy you an ice cream!

Thought we're gone?

04:08.040 --> 04:11.690
I knew you were still there, you shavelings.

04:17.620 --> 04:19.730
I am a top-class spy...

04:20.790 --> 04:24.400
carrying out the mission of
playing an idiot at shantytown.

04:26.830 --> 04:27.640
You, idiot!

04:29.100 --> 04:32.340
Why the idiot runs so fast?

04:32.600 --> 04:34.910
How the hell can I become the legend?

04:37.440 --> 04:43.450
SECRETLY, GREATLY

04:44.580 --> 04:47.720
Dong-go! You still sleeping?

04:48.820 --> 04:52.660
You need to work harder
as you are <i>less</i> smart.

04:52.790 --> 04:57.330
JEON Soon-im, 58, my employer.
People call her Market Grannie.

04:57.890 --> 04:59.740
I'm using her for my disguise.

05:00.600 --> 05:04.070
She gave me a room for doing
tedious chores for her store.

05:05.570 --> 05:10.480
Of course,
I get paid for my labor separately.

05:14.010 --> 05:15.390
As much as... 200 dollars a month!

05:17.810 --> 05:20.800
I saved 4,573 dollars so far.

05:21.350 --> 05:23.660
I'll be rich when I return home!

05:25.390 --> 05:26.990
I don't care the size of the mission.

05:28.860 --> 05:31.070
All I care is to complete it without failure!

05:34.830 --> 05:36.780
Snot mark completed!

05:45.070 --> 05:51.860

That can't kill you. Fall harder!

This is a key point to apprehend
flow of human traffic in the morning.

06:06.660 --> 06:08.870
Dong-go, you are so diligent.

06:10.130 --> 06:13.840
YOON Yoo-ran, 22.
Accounting clerk at a small company.

06:15.440 --> 06:17.940
You're getting prettier everyday.

06:19.610 --> 06:22.060
Idiot! Told you not to peek at my sister!

06:23.780 --> 06:25.560
Will kill you if you come on to her.

06:26.550 --> 06:28.760
YOON Yoo-joon, 18. High school student.

06:29.390 --> 06:29.950
Younger brother of Yoo-ran.

06:30.390 --> 06:33.990
- Wait for me, sis!
- I'm late.

06:34.390 --> 06:38.630
I'll cut your wrist when the time comes.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.940
Young ones throw this away
only when garbage bag is half full.

06:43.630 --> 06:47.380
Many a mickle makes a muckle. Step on it!

06:51.980 --> 06:55.390
How can you survive being that clumsy?

06:56.750 --> 07:00.020
She keeps 7 installments savings
by saving trash collection fee.

07:00.750 --> 07:02.630
What a dreadful penny pincher.

07:04.790 --> 07:10.100
But she won't notice
I put more beef in my soup!

07:12.830 --> 07:14.740
- Damn stupid granny!
- Hurry!

07:16.130 --> 07:17.980
Why don't you wake up your brother?
Bro!

07:37.420 --> 07:40.830
2PM. The ldliest hour of a day.

07:42.760 --> 07:46.540
I'm not sleeping. Just acting.

07:52.470 --> 07:55.750
Two sausages for Chi-woong

07:57.910 --> 07:58.720
Dong-go!

08:04.680 --> 08:05.850
A carton of cigarette, please.

08:09.390 --> 08:12.760
Ran. A girl sneaked in 98 days ago.

08:13.720 --> 08:16.330
Shows reprehensible life style.

08:17.660 --> 08:18.800
Did you hear me?

08:21.860 --> 08:24.440
Calm down! Don't look at it!

08:25.400 --> 08:26.710
Avert your eyes.

08:27.740 --> 08:30.680
That's a mere feeding means to the babies!

08:31.070 --> 08:32.820
I asked for the cigarette.

08:32.980 --> 08:36.650
You can get killed wearing
like that in the Republic, bitch!

08:36.750 --> 08:42.890
Granny isn't here, is she?
Thanks Dong-go. See you.

08:48.730 --> 08:51.400
Dong-go, is granny in?

08:52.100 --> 08:53.730
No, she went to bank.

08:53.800 --> 08:54.740
I see.

08:56.830 --> 08:57.810
Any change?

08:58.870 --> 09:00.750
Nothing special.

09:01.570 --> 09:02.780
No change in population and their routines.

09:04.740 --> 09:07.620
I hope the Party didn't forget about me.

09:08.980 --> 09:10.510
How long have you been here?

09:11.550 --> 09:12.690
736 days.

09:13.680 --> 09:14.790
Still counting by days?

09:15.720 --> 09:19.790
It's been 16 years for me.
My memory gets bleak.

09:20.060 --> 09:21.400
In a way, I feel kinda relaxed.

09:24.030 --> 09:27.100
You seem upbeat. Any good news?

09:28.770 --> 09:29.470
Do <i>m</i>

09:31.130 --> 09:34.480
Actually, I got promoted as a keyman.

09:34.840 --> 09:37.980
- Commissioned officer for the Party?
- Hush!

09:40.480 --> 09:42.460
No, as a manager of Sista fan club.

09:49.750 --> 09:52.060
You should try to find
an interest in the South.

09:54.820 --> 09:55.770
Interest...

09:57.560 --> 10:00.840
Well, what can you do
as an idiot living in a slum?

10:01.860 --> 10:03.670
I don't understand the Party!

10:04.830 --> 10:06.640
You're a top officer!

10:06.740 --> 10:09.740
Comrade! That's a rebellious idea!

10:11.110 --> 10:13.550
You can't measure the missions
for our great nation.

10:21.880 --> 10:25.020
You look nervous today,
Comrade Lieutenant.

10:27.560 --> 10:28.540
I am wondering today's the day?

10:33.860 --> 10:36.810
Incredible. I cannot even imagine myself...

10:39.970 --> 10:40.950
Please take care.

10:47.710 --> 10:48.780
It looks like raining.

11:08.530 --> 11:09.570
You brought us pork?

11:09.700 --> 11:10.700
I told you so.

11:10.900 --> 11:12.380
Can't wait!

11:12.770 --> 11:14.680
- Hurry home!
- Yes!

11:16.840 --> 11:17.720
Things are going smooth.

11:18.880 --> 11:20.380
I'm getting the signal.

11:21.710 --> 11:23.520
I'm sorry for the kids, however,
as they are with a mature woman

11:24.380 --> 11:26.880
who went through bitter side of life,

11:28.420 --> 11:30.090
their shock shall be minimized.

11:39.130 --> 11:42.370
- Oh, it's Dong-go the idiot!
- What're you doing, Dong-go?

11:44.030 --> 11:46.740
L...dunno...what to do.

12:14.700 --> 12:19.740
God. Hi. It was urgent.

12:40.020 --> 12:42.330
Good-bye, my love.

12:46.960 --> 12:49.710
DUMP A LOAD ON THE STREET
ONCE EVERY SIX MONTH

12:51.570 --> 12:54.100
It's really weird you caught a cold.

12:55.770 --> 12:58.010
Don't worry 'bout the store
and take some rest.

13:04.680 --> 13:06.520
I can deduct from your wage.

13:29.140 --> 13:29.810
Hi.

13:32.880 --> 13:35.010
You dirty pervert shitting on the road.

13:36.510 --> 13:38.460
Warned you not to peek at my sister!

13:39.850 --> 13:42.630
From today, don't even look at her shadow!

13:45.920 --> 13:48.530
Got it? You idiot?

13:49.060 --> 13:50.940
Just go when you're done.

13:51.360 --> 13:52.700
Hey, get up now!

13:52.900 --> 13:54.470
I need some time alone.

13:54.730 --> 13:55.900
Did I hit too hard?

13:56.800 --> 13:57.680
Wait for me!

14:02.000 --> 14:02.780
You damn fool.

14:06.010 --> 14:07.540
<i>CHO Duo-sank, 3'5.</i>

14:07.810 --> 14:08.410
You should hit back!

14:08.610 --> 14:11.750
Market Grannie's son.
Bad tempered like his mom.

14:11.950 --> 14:15.760
Too fast? I bet it is.
You should hit like this.

14:15.920 --> 14:17.760
Look. If you paw the air,
hey, like saying look at me!

14:18.120 --> 14:21.930
Then, you get in and land an uppercut to him!

14:22.830 --> 14:24.030
Try n!

14:32.700 --> 14:34.680
Right, like that! Good. Continue!

14:45.480 --> 14:46.050
What are you thinking?

14:48.680 --> 14:49.890
Throw the punch!

14:50.820 --> 14:52.890
Stop that. Bother him no more.

14:53.720 --> 14:57.830
He has to clean and do the delivery.

14:57.890 --> 15:00.840
Mom, someone needs to teach him to fight.

15:01.430 --> 15:03.500
He laughs even though he gets hit everyday.

15:04.730 --> 15:05.710
Dong-go!

15:06.740 --> 15:08.980
- Mr. Postman!
- You crazy bugger!

15:09.740 --> 15:11.690
Where are you going? We have to deliver!

15:18.480 --> 15:19.690
Report for this month.

15:19.820 --> 15:21.090
Surely top agent gets a special treatment.

15:23.450 --> 15:24.430
A mission is assigned?

15:25.420 --> 15:28.700
Complete the grand mission
and return to the North.

15:29.530 --> 15:31.100
I'm sure you can make it.
You're nothing like me.

15:33.000 --> 15:33.700
Thanks to you

15:34.960 --> 15:36.880
I got news from home, too.

15:37.830 --> 15:41.370
My mother passed away last winter.

16:17.770 --> 16:23.660
Mother, It's been 11 years
since I paid my respect to you.

16:38.730 --> 16:41.800
What did you eat today? Give me that.

16:44.370 --> 16:48.440
I told you to change! My words are laws.

16:49.140 --> 16:50.670
I'm a cane of whom?

16:50.940 --> 16:51.710
Papillion.

16:51.970 --> 16:59.620
A cane of populace.
Especially of Ms. Ran!

17:00.380 --> 17:01.830
Delivery!

17:07.960 --> 17:10.670
Rumour said a scrub flew in
and guess it's true.

17:10.829 --> 17:12.500
Oh, Dong-go is here!

17:13.900 --> 17:15.069
- Hi.
- I'm here too!

17:15.700 --> 17:20.940
At your disposal! It's light like a feather!

17:21.670 --> 17:22.910
Then keep holding it.

17:23.940 --> 17:26.579
GO Hwi-soon,
65. People call him Old man GO.

17:26.880 --> 17:29.690
Richest man in the neighborhood
living with a bachelor son.

17:30.110 --> 17:32.590
He has four rooms for rent.
$150 per month for each!

17:33.480 --> 17:37.360
You turned off the boiler again?
I only got the cold water!

17:37.620 --> 17:42.400
Cold water is good for health.
It's steaming hot even in October.

17:43.030 --> 17:46.530
You old miser drive me nuts.

18:03.950 --> 18:04.890
Bad to waste the food.

18:09.720 --> 18:12.460
How can I tune this thing?

18:12.790 --> 18:15.560
Hey blondie! Come out and say hello.

18:18.890 --> 18:20.740
We have a new tenant called KIM.

18:21.360 --> 18:26.840
He's a singer wanna-be. It's like
all my tenants are singer wanna-bes.

18:26.900 --> 18:30.850
You mean me? I'm a jazz musician!

18:34.640 --> 18:36.680
Even if you fall a victim

18:37.810 --> 18:40.420
to a dagger while sleeping or if someone
aims the gun at your temple on the street.

18:41.480 --> 18:43.490
Anything can happen to a spy.

18:44.550 --> 18:51.990
But, why? Did I make any mistake?

18:53.760 --> 18:55.640
Or am I deserted by the country?

18:56.730 --> 19:02.810
LEE Hae-rang.
Leader of Black Dragon Troop.

19:03.570 --> 19:05.520
Your instinct didn't wane at all!

19:06.710 --> 19:09.950
It's been a while, Comrade WON.
Open the door.

19:46.850 --> 19:52.630
We didn't afford the luxury
of feeling anything.

19:54.420 --> 19:57.030
That was the only way for us to live.

19:59.030 --> 19:59.770
Stop!

20:00.500 --> 20:03.710
Don't need to risk your life
for the inner competition.

20:07.640 --> 20:09.840
Your skills didn't get rusty at all.

20:10.610 --> 20:12.090
Better loosen up a bit though.

20:14.810 --> 20:15.650
Why are you here?

20:15.980 --> 20:19.620
Son of General LEE can
do whatever in Pyong-yang.

20:21.950 --> 20:22.720
It's embarrassing!

20:23.850 --> 20:25.560
You knew my father put me in?

20:26.760 --> 20:28.960
I asked for the mission
because I was bored there.

20:29.460 --> 20:30.700
Mission? What mission?

20:32.060 --> 20:33.730
We're not supposed to
ask each other's mission.

20:34.830 --> 20:37.000
But why sent you? I'm here already.

20:37.670 --> 20:39.650
You don't get it? They don't trust you.

20:39.770 --> 20:42.440
You could've turned coat
after <i>2</i> years in the South.

20:43.470 --> 20:46.920
Watch your tongue!
it felt like 20 years to me!

20:50.080 --> 20:53.530
You can't imagine how much I got excited

20:53.720 --> 20:55.350
since I first heard from my father
that he formed 5446 Unit.

20:56.520 --> 20:57.690
Everyone lives only once.

20:57.990 --> 21:01.730
Then you should fight hard
to become a legend.

21:03.960 --> 21:06.960
I'll build the history and return as a legend.

21:07.600 --> 21:10.810
You stay here carrying out
the mission of playing a fool.

21:38.130 --> 21:40.470
- Hello.
- You are here.

21:41.100 --> 21:41.840
I'll leave it here.

21:42.060 --> 21:43.570
Yes. Thank you.

21:49.640 --> 21:50.340
<i>HQQ m
mung'</i>

21:55.480 --> 21:58.690
I've done nothing but waiting!
And he got the mission right away!

21:59.580 --> 22:00.320
How are you?

22:01.120 --> 22:04.760
I'll witness myself what history he builds.

23:08.780 --> 23:12.860
What are you doing here?
This is my district.

23:21.060 --> 23:22.870
I see...way to go!

23:26.570 --> 23:26.740
Way to go!

23:48.390 --> 23:48.870
Hey, DOFTSPQU-

23:49.930 --> 23:51.430
You got chubby overnight?

23:53.000 --> 23:53.740
Hey!

24:06.010 --> 24:07.720
Shit, those little ones!

24:47.920 --> 24:50.090
The Party orders me
to be disguised as a rocker.

24:50.590 --> 24:52.360
But I need to pass the audition.

24:53.690 --> 24:54.670
Your mission is much better than mine.

24:55.760 --> 24:57.000
Mine is playing a fool!

24:58.860 --> 25:00.460
Thought passing an audition
is a piece of cake.

25:01.130 --> 25:04.740
But fuckers in the South
surely can sing and play!

25:05.030 --> 25:07.600
You can do it! Forgot who we are?

25:07.700 --> 25:09.810
The Republic's warriors
who can do anything!

25:11.810 --> 25:14.750
Right! I will practice until my fingers bleed.

25:15.940 --> 25:19.760
Will show real people's rock
to buggers in the South!

25:36.700 --> 25:37.680
Comrade SUH Sang-go...

25:52.350 --> 25:56.630
Dear loving mother...

25:56.950 --> 26:01.090
Dong-go! It's me, wake up.

26:02.090 --> 26:05.830
I'll kill you if you don't come now.

26:06.660 --> 26:09.440
Dong-go, wake up!

26:14.870 --> 26:16.780
- What?
- You fool!

26:17.640 --> 26:20.950
Move quick when I call you.

26:21.710 --> 26:24.950
- Go look for my brother.
- Brother?

26:25.680 --> 26:30.030
He went out to pee and didn't come back.

26:31.120 --> 26:31.790
Good!

26:33.860 --> 26:39.530
Why is it good? Such a fool!

26:39.930 --> 26:41.410
Good that he can't throw me
a rock any more.

26:41.660 --> 26:47.080
He never left me alone since our dad died.

26:48.140 --> 26:52.640
What should I do
if he leaves me like dad.

26:53.880 --> 26:56.910
Find him for me, Dong-go!

27:00.080 --> 27:03.660
I'll give you half.
No, you can take it all.

27:11.490 --> 27:15.700
Why coming to my house?
I told you he's not here, idiot!

27:20.740 --> 27:22.080
Toilet is scary.

27:32.010 --> 27:33.620
Less than 30 minutes passed.

27:36.020 --> 27:39.690
Juvenile diabetes.
Should reduce the sweets.

27:41.720 --> 27:45.760
No trace of struggle. Work of a professional.

28:01.540 --> 28:03.350
Woong! Where are you?

28:03.610 --> 28:05.680
When did you get up there?

28:07.080 --> 28:08.560
I can see better here.

28:10.420 --> 28:11.590
Look inside once again.

28:12.690 --> 28:13.670
Told you he's not here!

28:19.930 --> 28:20.930
Stand up quick!

28:21.800 --> 28:25.750
You don't have time to fall down and weep.

28:28.400 --> 28:32.720
Where did the kiddo go?
It's the time for my beauty sleep.

28:34.480 --> 28:36.620
Let's scatter and search.

28:41.750 --> 28:44.060
It's your turn, kiddo.

28:44.920 --> 28:47.370
Shout out loud with your bloody voice.

28:48.860 --> 28:52.030
I'll be with Ran as it's dangerous...

28:52.560 --> 28:54.060
Cut the crap and follow me.

28:57.070 --> 28:58.540
- Oh my!
- What are you wearing?

28:58.830 --> 29:01.510
- Why hit me?
- Wear proper clothes.

29:01.840 --> 29:03.780
There might be perverts.

29:04.370 --> 29:05.820
Just give cigarettes on thick.

29:12.780 --> 29:13.690
I said no.

29:13.880 --> 29:14.720
Good.

29:18.390 --> 29:19.560
One more time!

29:22.420 --> 29:23.770
No, I won't go!

29:26.130 --> 29:27.730
I won't let anyone interrupt
my sabotage area.

29:28.600 --> 29:29.940
I should be the one to give
damn kiddo a lesson!

29:37.670 --> 29:38.550
Shit, I can't show my face.
Let me borrow your clothes.

29:41.680 --> 29:42.810
I won't go with an empty hand!

29:43.580 --> 29:45.850
You're so stubborn!

29:46.950 --> 29:49.090
What are you doing, Mr. PARK?

29:49.780 --> 29:51.990
But you can't come here.
It's far from your house.

29:52.820 --> 29:55.060
Your mom should be worried.
Just hurry home.

29:55.660 --> 29:57.830
Then give me that cookie
you brought last time.

29:58.360 --> 30:00.570
You just went back with it.

30:00.800 --> 30:01.570
What's going on here?

30:01.800 --> 30:05.800
Cookie? I see. Take this and go home.

30:06.900 --> 30:09.820
But don't tell anyone that you met me.

30:10.810 --> 30:12.650
You shouldn't tell your mom about it.

30:13.710 --> 30:14.980
Why not?

30:16.710 --> 30:19.750
It's a bit complicated. My situation is...

30:20.350 --> 30:23.560
I'll tell your mother myself
when the time comes.

30:23.850 --> 30:28.460
Promise me. It's between the real men.

30:30.860 --> 30:33.740
I see, he has feelings for the kid's mom.

30:33.960 --> 30:36.440
- Pervert!
- Damn pervert!

30:36.800 --> 30:39.680
Gotta ya! Look what he's wearing!

30:41.000 --> 30:41.950
That's my lingerie!

30:44.010 --> 30:46.880
Damn. What did I pick?

30:47.380 --> 30:49.320
What? You damn bastard!

30:52.050 --> 30:52.820
Damn. What the hell.

30:53.980 --> 30:57.620
You have a right to remain silent.

30:58.690 --> 31:01.530
You damn pervert!

31:04.890 --> 31:05.800
You damn pervert!

31:12.430 --> 31:12.910
Oh, it's Chi-woong!

31:17.010 --> 31:17.750
Are you okay?

31:19.540 --> 31:20.920
Did you save
the Chi-woong from the pervert?

31:21.640 --> 31:23.680
- Baby!
- Mom.

31:24.680 --> 31:26.660
Mr. PARK saved him.

31:26.720 --> 31:28.560
- You scared us!
- Thank you, sir.

31:29.720 --> 31:30.660
Where have you been?
Se-woong was so worried about you.

31:33.420 --> 31:36.560
Don't ever leave me alone again!
I think there a pervert in this town...

31:39.360 --> 31:41.360
SAFE HOUSE OF NIS

31:41.660 --> 31:43.070
HIDING KIM HEE-KWAN,
EX-DIRECTOR OF MPAF, NORTH KOREA

31:44.430 --> 31:46.610
North Korean defectors
are being eliminated.

31:47.540 --> 31:50.680
Do you have any idea who are doing this?

31:52.510 --> 31:53.380
5446 Unit.

31:54.580 --> 32:01.620
KIM Jeong-il and LEE Moo-hyuk
created a secret troop 16 years ago.

32:02.480 --> 32:05.660
Nobody knew
about the troop except these two.

32:07.720 --> 32:09.500
Now KIM Jeong-il has gone,

32:09.690 --> 32:13.040
it's practically LEE's private troops.

32:14.530 --> 32:17.910
Tell us everything you know about them.

32:22.740 --> 32:24.340
They're not human.

32:25.740 --> 32:29.120
They were trained to be wild animals...

32:30.750 --> 32:34.890
once they were selected
through a tough competition.

32:37.120 --> 32:40.500
You can never be their match!

32:53.540 --> 32:54.710
Isn't our regular rendez-vous tomorrow?

32:55.770 --> 32:59.740
The party sent me an order
to return to the North.

33:02.510 --> 33:05.490
Good. You'll meet the family.

33:05.680 --> 33:07.850
- I wanna ask you a favor.
- Sure.

33:09.780 --> 33:12.820
Give me one of the pistols you got.

33:20.660 --> 33:21.940
You need to tell me why first.

33:23.570 --> 33:28.570
My family got caught
while escaping to China.

33:29.740 --> 33:33.690
You mean they betrayed the Republic?

33:34.580 --> 33:36.060
Didn't even think I'd be here this long!

33:38.350 --> 33:41.730
I only heard of mother's death
after one year.

33:43.380 --> 33:44.730
You know what troubles me most?

33:47.490 --> 33:52.730
Now, I can't picture my family's faces.

33:54.800 --> 33:56.040
I should have treasured

33:59.700 --> 34:01.080
at least this picture more.

34:06.710 --> 34:07.740
Please help me!

34:09.340 --> 34:11.719
I should kill some bastards
in the South including myself...

34:14.020 --> 34:17.790
to grab a bleak chance of saving my family.

34:28.429 --> 34:29.460
Thanks, Comrade WON.

34:32.870 --> 34:35.639
Second Lieutenant SUH!
Commit suicide now.

34:37.469 --> 34:37.969
Comrade.

34:40.110 --> 34:41.590
It's an order from the lieutenant.

34:54.960 --> 34:56.800
This would be the better
way to save your family.

34:57.730 --> 34:59.710
Do not tinker with the situation.

35:12.740 --> 35:14.780
Magazine is not loaded
unless we're in mission!

35:16.440 --> 35:22.090
You became an ordinary mister in the South.

35:24.690 --> 35:26.830
You can't understand me as
you don't have wife and kids.

35:30.730 --> 35:31.670
Listen to me carefully.

35:32.590 --> 35:34.600
Stay loyal to the Republic
till the minute you die.

35:35.130 --> 35:36.840
Try hardest to survive
and return home.

35:37.000 --> 35:40.840
That's the only way to meet
your family again if they're still alive.

35:41.400 --> 35:43.940
Even if you end up
having the reunion in prison.

35:44.840 --> 35:46.010
Comrade Lieutenant...

35:46.470 --> 35:47.820
I have seen enough of your shits already.

36:00.390 --> 36:05.630
Return to who you are,
brave soldier of the Republic.

36:07.100 --> 36:09.600
It's a Barret, anti-material rifle.

36:09.830 --> 36:14.540
We'll create a unit against
5446 under your command.

36:26.680 --> 36:28.820
- Another audition?
- Sure.

36:32.550 --> 36:35.760
L"m late for work! Told you
I'm on the night shift.

36:36.490 --> 36:39.400
Take a sip. I made your favorite soup.

36:39.660 --> 36:43.070
I'm late. Dong-go!
Why didn't you wake me up?

36:43.670 --> 36:46.340
Don't re-use that wet tissue.
It's embarrassing!

36:46.700 --> 36:50.340
Have to reduce the garbage
for saving the earth!

36:50.940 --> 36:51.880
Yeah, whatever.

36:52.470 --> 36:54.580
Eating is more important
than serving the country.

36:57.080 --> 36:59.680
- Dong-go, come and eat.
- Yes.

37:05.690 --> 37:10.760
The rice is cooked just perfect.
Shame he couldn't eat this.

37:13.530 --> 37:14.010
_ DOHQ-go,
. Yes?

37:16.100 --> 37:18.600
You like the soup that much?

37:25.110 --> 37:28.320
How are you, mother?

37:29.840 --> 37:32.590
Would we be just like granny and Doo-seok

37:33.720 --> 37:35.890
if we lived together?

37:38.450 --> 37:41.730
I just envy them talking and quarreling
everyday.

37:42.760 --> 37:44.070
When I go back,

37:46.530 --> 37:50.980
I'll play a child to you.

37:51.830 --> 37:53.540
Hope you understand.

38:22.830 --> 38:26.640
You know who you are aiming at?

38:32.140 --> 38:35.920
Came from the North? Name your troop!

38:37.510 --> 38:41.790
Believe you're executing
your mission flawlessly?

38:44.120 --> 38:47.360
One more chance. State your rank!

38:50.560 --> 38:53.730
If you pull the trigger, you will die too.

38:55.760 --> 38:57.670
Dong-go. Are you sleeping?

38:58.800 --> 39:02.370
Tomorrow's delivery
will be earlier than usual.

39:03.440 --> 39:06.610
You should get up earlier!
Guess he's sleeping, bugger.

39:09.710 --> 39:11.310
WON Ryu-hwan.
Leader of Five Star Troop.

39:11.780 --> 39:13.620
Are you worried
about South Korean granny?

39:14.780 --> 39:16.690
Why should I?

39:22.460 --> 39:23.830
Don't forget who you are.

39:25.790 --> 39:29.570
You carry the honor of
the country, Captain WON.

40:14.810 --> 40:17.480
He's damn fast.

40:17.780 --> 40:18.980
Hey, DOFTSPQU-

40:22.620 --> 40:25.560
- What are you doing?
- What am I doing?

40:25.850 --> 40:30.530
Glad to see you. Come with me.

40:31.760 --> 40:33.800
- Can't come down.
- Come down, right now!

40:53.920 --> 40:55.420
Faster, faster!

41:01.490 --> 41:03.700
That's it? I want more.

41:05.760 --> 41:08.800
Why does this drunkard bitch harass me?

41:09.600 --> 41:10.840
You get sick if you drink.

41:10.900 --> 41:11.710
Shut up.

41:12.600 --> 41:14.840
What does an idiot know?

41:19.040 --> 41:19.780
Dong-go.

41:21.440 --> 41:22.750
I envy you.

41:23.810 --> 41:27.420
You must not have any worries.

41:28.850 --> 41:31.330
No need to pretend to be cool.

41:31.620 --> 41:32.860
I need to sleep.

41:36.760 --> 41:41.710
Right. I feel good! Let's go!

41:44.630 --> 41:48.410
Time to confess our secrets.

41:50.140 --> 41:55.380
My real name is HUH Jeom-ran.

41:59.610 --> 42:01.590
Let's get this over quick!

42:03.120 --> 42:04.650
I, Jeom-ran...

42:08.990 --> 42:11.060
gave a birth...

42:13.390 --> 42:14.960
when I was 18 years old.

42:17.670 --> 42:20.810
But I haven't seen him for 7 years.

42:27.680 --> 42:31.710
My parents sent him to States
for the adoption.

42:36.350 --> 42:37.390
I really miss him.

42:44.560 --> 42:45.700
It's your turn now!

42:51.100 --> 42:52.100
I didn't know. All I knew was
the basic things about her.

42:53.870 --> 42:55.750
My name is Dong-go.

43:00.110 --> 43:06.390
But real name is Ryu-hwan.

43:08.750 --> 43:09.750
I am...

43:12.620 --> 43:13.560
...a North Korean spy.

43:23.630 --> 43:25.370
Wow, she's deadly faint.

43:26.500 --> 43:28.340
You're not just playing a fool.

43:28.970 --> 43:30.850
But fooling around too?

43:31.110 --> 43:31.780
Fooling around with whom?

43:36.780 --> 43:38.090
Don't practice at night
when people are sleeping.

43:38.810 --> 43:40.690
I'm not in the position to be considerate.

44:08.080 --> 44:08.750
Damn bitch.

44:10.110 --> 44:13.620
But it's way better than
shitting on the street.

44:14.750 --> 44:16.920
Why are you still here?
Got something to talk to?

44:18.920 --> 44:19.900
- Didn't someone come to you?
- I see.

44:21.760 --> 44:25.730
The Party sent you someone.
Did you kill him?

44:26.660 --> 44:27.640
No, he just warned me and left.

44:27.900 --> 44:29.370
It's not unusual.

44:29.800 --> 44:32.870
The honchos don't trust us in the beginning.

44:32.970 --> 44:35.000
They get anxious
once the salmon leaves home.

44:36.470 --> 44:38.610
- Salmon?
- You didn't know?

44:38.870 --> 44:41.750
They call us salmons as they return to spawn.

44:42.440 --> 44:46.950
They want us to return after
we achieve a big mission.

44:47.580 --> 44:49.460
- Interesting.
- You think so?

44:51.020 --> 44:55.560
Well, we and salmon risk our lives
and go against the stream.

44:58.490 --> 45:01.340
Cut the crap. Time to sleep.

45:04.570 --> 45:05.570
Comrade Lieutenant WON!

45:08.470 --> 45:09.070
You know what?

45:10.100 --> 45:13.750
Even if a salmon returns home alive,

45:13.910 --> 45:16.680
it dies after it spawned.

45:20.780 --> 45:24.520
Comrade, that's what we all are prepared for.

45:26.750 --> 45:28.890
I can gladly die as long as the Party

45:29.890 --> 45:31.600
takes care of my mother.

45:35.660 --> 45:38.740
That's your problem.

45:45.410 --> 45:46.850
Stop hiding and come out.

45:54.680 --> 45:56.820
Wrong intuition.

45:59.050 --> 46:00.790
That's my problem.

46:08.360 --> 46:11.830
Don't forget who you are, Captain WON.

46:13.030 --> 46:14.880
He called me captain.

46:46.570 --> 46:47.710
Name of the troop and your age.

46:48.540 --> 46:51.810
LEE Hae-jin, trainee in 5446.

46:53.440 --> 46:54.820
Becoming 13 this year.

46:56.410 --> 47:00.050
I respect you, Comrade Captain!

47:07.520 --> 47:08.520
You are a big boy, now.

47:09.720 --> 47:11.530
Comrade LEE.
Reserved member for Five Star.

47:14.400 --> 47:17.840
What's happening in the Party?
You're assigned to here?

47:25.470 --> 47:27.650
Bastard, can't you say hello at least?

47:35.480 --> 47:37.930
Captain remembers me.

47:50.000 --> 47:53.740
Strange they sent two new men so suddenly.

47:56.440 --> 47:59.780
More weird as there was no move
for the past two years, though.

48:19.390 --> 48:24.930
Dong-go,
show some respect to your big brother!

48:27.570 --> 48:31.680
Say hello my new punky at school.

48:31.910 --> 48:34.850
This is Dong-go the idiot.
My minion the village.

48:35.840 --> 48:38.020
Minion and punky, greet each other!

48:40.580 --> 48:41.790
- How... are you?
- Hi.

48:43.480 --> 48:45.760
Good! Eat whatever you want.

48:46.550 --> 48:48.590
Put that on my sister's bill!

48:53.590 --> 48:58.940
- Mister...
- What?

48:59.800 --> 49:00.800
What happened to Mr. Sang-go?

49:01.040 --> 49:03.520
Can't reach him since yesterday.
He's never like this before.

49:12.780 --> 49:16.690
LEE Moo-hyuk loses ground
after the new regime.

49:17.020 --> 49:20.690
And 5446 Troop's exposed
when his henchmen exiled.

49:20.990 --> 49:23.330
It seems like LEE ordered soldiers
of 5446 to kill the deported.

49:24.120 --> 49:27.330
We formed the special force
for 5446 Troop.

49:27.830 --> 49:32.800
We heard that KIM Jeong-eun
wants to ease the tension.

49:33.400 --> 49:36.010
Let's wait first
as we're in the peaceful mood.

49:37.000 --> 49:39.010
Make sure to minimize our risk.

49:39.570 --> 49:42.380
I will try to use it as
an advantageous card for us.

49:43.110 --> 49:46.750
We need to identify
soldiers of 5446 in Korea.

49:47.050 --> 49:50.720
You can be dismissed if you're done.

49:53.750 --> 49:54.360
Yes, sir.

50:02.800 --> 50:04.780
Anything you want to talk?

50:05.500 --> 50:07.640
Did you kill SUH Sang-go?

50:08.470 --> 50:09.780
What is he to you?

50:11.710 --> 50:12.680
Answer the question.

50:14.370 --> 50:15.750
He tried to kill himself.

50:16.810 --> 50:19.550
But I stopped him as
the Party wants him back alive.

50:20.710 --> 50:24.560
Now he's on the way to North.
He can die there if he still wants to.

50:25.820 --> 50:27.530
What's your mission anyway?

50:31.860 --> 50:35.360
I'll replace Comrade SUH.

50:35.700 --> 50:37.770
You're mere a member!
You're not qualified for it!

50:38.830 --> 50:39.900
I'm not that little kid anymore.

50:44.040 --> 50:48.680
- I'm okay, sir.
- Life is quite tough on you, right?

50:48.880 --> 50:49.620
Why are you doing this?

50:49.740 --> 50:51.690
Wanna know? Since I like you!

50:52.480 --> 50:55.620
You know my feelings, I love you.

50:55.750 --> 50:57.920
I'll scream if you keep doing it.

50:59.050 --> 51:02.800
You wanna get fired?

51:03.360 --> 51:05.700
You think you can go somewhere else?

51:06.860 --> 51:08.000
Son of a bitch.

51:08.960 --> 51:10.840
- Please don't.
- Listen to me!

51:11.570 --> 51:14.100
Go and help her. She must not see me.

51:15.840 --> 51:18.820
Why should I help that bitch?
I don't even know her.

51:20.570 --> 51:21.780
Are you by any chance worried about her?

51:22.640 --> 51:26.720
No, it's not for her!
She's Yoo-joon's sister!

51:27.450 --> 51:32.660
You need to win family's heart
to get his trust!

51:34.620 --> 51:37.860
Then shall I bring him
the head of that bastard?

51:38.690 --> 51:43.110
No! Just scare him first.

51:44.130 --> 51:45.870
Too much kindness would be
overwhelming in the beginning.

51:49.840 --> 51:50.940
What are you doing here?

51:51.770 --> 51:53.480
Yoo-joon, I'm ok!

51:53.740 --> 51:56.650
I thought you never got this
as you are flat-chested.

51:57.440 --> 52:00.820
Stop or your sis will get fired!

52:00.880 --> 52:02.380
Please don't!

52:02.620 --> 52:05.430
Fire her! I can feed her, you bastard!

52:08.090 --> 52:09.570
Don't hit him.

52:10.060 --> 52:11.040
I will definitely make
you losers pay for this!

52:11.590 --> 52:17.840
Isn't our mission in trouble

52:20.870 --> 52:24.840
if she loses her job?

52:25.910 --> 52:27.780
Let men bury him quietly.

52:28.610 --> 52:29.550
You got a cell, right?

52:33.680 --> 52:37.860
Look at the camera!

52:39.690 --> 52:41.670
Will kill you if you don't look at it.

52:44.490 --> 52:47.600
Once you fire her, this picture
will be all over the internet.

52:51.800 --> 52:52.940
Now, time to shoot the movie.

52:54.800 --> 52:55.680
The movie?

52:56.900 --> 52:58.710
Shake it! Harder! Good!

53:03.810 --> 53:08.760
Captain, you're way more
terrifying than I thought you're.

53:09.520 --> 53:10.320
Shake harder!

53:17.690 --> 53:19.760
I don't think I can allow you
to do it even if it's a mission.

53:20.060 --> 53:23.530
- It's okay. I can do it.
- No!

53:24.400 --> 53:26.380
I cannot let our captain
do this kind of thing.

53:27.700 --> 53:31.340
I'll take care of damn granny
sometime soon.

53:31.670 --> 53:36.420
Focus on your mission!
She's just an old woman.

53:37.080 --> 53:39.960
That's why young ones shouldn't
be assigned with mission.

53:40.780 --> 53:42.730
Guess you insisted on coming.

53:46.020 --> 53:47.760
I didn't earn it for free.

53:50.060 --> 53:52.000
I risked my life to be a captain.

54:00.900 --> 54:03.070
Stop planning to fool around.
Grab this, Comrade.

54:03.670 --> 54:06.380
You let me work to make
your captain take some rest?

54:07.140 --> 54:09.520
Fuck! The Party
should've sent my henchman!

54:12.680 --> 54:13.350
Pull it.

54:22.120 --> 54:24.400
Is this old hag deaf?

54:25.390 --> 54:27.700
We'll supply all the alcohol
for you which is good.

54:27.930 --> 54:29.000
It's you who can't hear!

54:29.460 --> 54:32.640
I already have my supplier

54:32.970 --> 54:36.540
who opened the account with me
when I had nothing 30 years ago!

54:36.740 --> 54:39.450
Don't be so hard on client, bro.

54:40.870 --> 54:46.520
I will take it from here, you may go.

54:47.650 --> 54:48.060
Yes, brother.

54:48.780 --> 54:50.890
You too bugger off!
It's the last thing I can do.

54:52.690 --> 54:56.330
That bastard! It took me
hours to pile up those boxes!

54:56.790 --> 54:57.700
Let me take care of him.
Just take our stuff in!

55:08.370 --> 55:10.350
- Dong-go, don't!
- What the hell?

55:10.900 --> 55:14.370
I'll bring my brother. He... policeman!

55:14.640 --> 55:18.020
Whatever, asshole! Then I'm a prosecutor!

55:18.750 --> 55:19.620
Dong-go, are you OK?

55:24.480 --> 55:28.830
He's been here for <i>2</i> years,
better to let him handle that.

55:29.660 --> 55:31.640
You don't have to beat him!

55:33.390 --> 55:34.960
Beating works best for the fools.

55:37.860 --> 55:39.870
Even a fool is messing up with me!

55:40.470 --> 55:43.810
I will teach you some lessons!

55:44.470 --> 55:46.450
Don't ! Stay out of trouble.

55:47.440 --> 55:48.750
Do you realize now who I am?

55:48.980 --> 55:52.320
What's up with her? What does she know?

55:52.580 --> 55:55.060
Just stay out of trouble, will you?

55:56.450 --> 56:01.490
What? Why didn't you call me?
Then they will bring the stuffs.

56:02.090 --> 56:04.690
Don't bother. I can handle that.

56:06.690 --> 56:08.470
Go see the doctor when you're ill.

56:08.960 --> 56:13.810
I'm perfectly fine. It's Dong-go
who got beaten so hard.

56:23.780 --> 56:25.420
It's the 'job' you talked about?

56:28.780 --> 56:29.990
At least it looks like a gun.

56:31.690 --> 56:37.030
- Your clothes...
- I borrowed them from Hae-rang.G:G

56:39.560 --> 56:41.770
- By the way...
- I knew you'd come.

56:42.460 --> 56:44.600
I got the bully's whereabouts.

56:53.110 --> 56:54.050
There's someone else.

56:56.740 --> 57:01.660
Damn liar! Impersonating a cop
when you only prepare to be one?

57:02.350 --> 57:04.450
I know all the pigs around here.

57:05.650 --> 57:07.760
I guarantee I'll pass the exam this time!

57:08.890 --> 57:13.360
So don't mess with my mom
before it's too late!

57:14.560 --> 57:17.510
Blabla...I'll be a prosecutor by then!

57:20.630 --> 57:21.770
Eat me, moron!

57:23.470 --> 57:26.010
Doo-seok doesn't know you, right?

57:26.740 --> 57:27.480
Scare them off a bit and
demolish the warehouse.

57:28.410 --> 57:29.650
Why demolish the warehouse?

57:39.120 --> 57:39.790
Do that for me, will you?

57:43.360 --> 57:43.800
Yes, sure.

57:47.560 --> 57:50.770
- Don't kill anyone though.
- Understood!

57:53.500 --> 57:56.110
Why is this little rat so cocky?

57:56.700 --> 57:58.810
I told you, I will be a cop!

58:13.990 --> 58:14.730
Who the hell are you?

58:17.020 --> 58:18.730
I even borrowed this outfit
in case of the blood fight.

58:24.930 --> 58:28.570
Frog, chick!

58:30.670 --> 58:31.740
Hello frog, morning chick!

58:33.610 --> 58:34.520
Chick! Frog!

58:35.080 --> 58:36.380
It's my bro...hi, there.

58:38.380 --> 58:41.790
Chick! Frog!

58:45.090 --> 58:46.560
It hurts a lot?

58:47.020 --> 58:50.730
It's nothing compared to what I did to them.

58:51.790 --> 58:53.700
Seen my martial arts skills?

58:54.360 --> 58:55.700
They're all in the hospital now.

58:56.800 --> 58:58.610
You best, my brother rock!

59:00.670 --> 59:01.340
You think I'm cool?

59:02.040 --> 59:03.710
<i>Doc-seek me bes?.!</i>

59:04.000 --> 59:05.070
Call me big bro!

59:06.870 --> 59:12.550
Remember, men must be
either very strong or smart

59:12.680 --> 59:16.650
to look after the loving ones.

59:19.350 --> 59:22.060
Or at least diligent...

59:26.030 --> 59:27.770
Forget it, you fool.
I doubt you understand this.

59:29.900 --> 59:36.370
It'll be only mom and you
when I get married one day.

59:37.140 --> 59:40.780
Then you will be left alone
at the end when mom...

59:43.040 --> 59:47.420
But don't worry, I will take care of
my family till the end!

59:47.750 --> 59:50.630
You can count on me, got it?

59:51.850 --> 59:53.760
Stop playing Godfather, fella.

59:54.820 --> 59:57.100
Let's ask mom to make
chicken soup tomorrow.

59:57.820 --> 59:59.800
- Okidoki!
- Okidoki!

59:59.990 --> 01:00:03.960
Okidoki, chicken soup!

01:00:08.030 --> 01:00:09.600
Did you find anything?

01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:16.750
I'm no longer a detective.
Why do you rush anyway?

01:00:17.380 --> 01:00:23.660
- The boy seems to have a story.
- Who doesn't have one?

01:00:26.690 --> 01:00:28.530
Take care of your health first.

01:00:31.460 --> 01:00:32.990
It's well done!

01:00:35.700 --> 01:00:36.770
Drink this magkoli, too.

01:00:36.860 --> 01:00:38.670
Have some kimchi.

01:00:39.570 --> 01:00:41.710
Hand me that plate...

01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:45.750
Come on in, Dong-go!

01:00:46.370 --> 01:00:47.680
Come join us quick!

01:00:48.710 --> 01:00:49.950
Dong-go, come sit here.

01:00:50.910 --> 01:00:52.050
Have a drink, blondie.

01:00:55.720 --> 01:00:56.920
Good job washing the sheets.

01:00:57.520 --> 01:00:58.460
Try this, open your mouth!

01:01:00.820 --> 01:01:01.660
Don't eat up the legs!

01:01:07.490 --> 01:01:08.870
I need them!

01:01:12.930 --> 01:01:13.740
Ran, look at this!

01:01:17.770 --> 01:01:19.050
Cocky bitch!

01:01:19.870 --> 01:01:21.610
You singer wanna-bes!

01:01:21.810 --> 01:01:23.790
There should be some music
when the food is served!

01:01:24.740 --> 01:01:25.720
I'm a real musician!

01:01:33.350 --> 01:01:34.090
Dingdo?g"

01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:03.750
I was always afraid...

01:02:05.550 --> 01:02:08.900
Afraid of being cut on rations
when I was little.

01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:13.700
Afraid of not being the best,
and abandoned by the Party

01:02:14.830 --> 01:02:16.900
when I was training at the camp.

01:02:19.630 --> 01:02:20.610
And now...

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:27.780
Afraid...if I might change.

01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:36.820
5446 TRAINING CAMP,
NORTH KOREA

01:02:39.050 --> 01:02:46.030
GBP is gossiping that
5446 Unit is my private army.

01:02:47.060 --> 01:02:48.510
Security Department, MPAF

01:02:48.700 --> 01:02:53.840
This puts me in a nettlesome situation.

01:02:55.600 --> 01:02:57.480
It was not a smart move
to purge KIM Hee-kwan.

01:02:57.540 --> 01:03:02.420
The operation was done flawlessly.

01:03:05.850 --> 01:03:08.020
Look! World has changed a lot.

01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:12.060
The President wants to salvage
the relationship with the South.

01:03:12.950 --> 01:03:14.630
I'm ready for your command, sir.

01:03:16.590 --> 01:03:18.470
Let the salmons return home.

01:03:27.530 --> 01:03:29.040
Shit! I can't do it!

01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:33.480
I didn't come to the South
to trim the anchovies.

01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:38.790
Don't pass your share to us.
Go talk up to the granny.

01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:45.920
Heavy work for a bowl of chicken soup?

01:03:48.450 --> 01:03:51.830
She's unbelievable!
I guess there's a hidden scheme.

01:03:53.790 --> 01:03:56.770
Number of these anchovies is 2,119.

01:03:57.360 --> 01:04:00.810
She might test us by having us
trim the small fish like these

01:04:00.970 --> 01:04:03.380
to see if we are stealing anything from her.

01:04:07.010 --> 01:04:08.010
What is he talking about?

01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:14.350
Then analyze the situation and tell me.

01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:17.350
Until when do we have to be on call?

01:04:17.750 --> 01:04:20.060
They will be executed as
traitors of the revolution.

01:04:21.390 --> 01:04:24.990
5446 Unit will be dismantled

01:04:25.790 --> 01:04:27.500
and no one should know it existed ever.

01:04:30.060 --> 01:04:31.870
Mission completed!

01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:37.910
Why are you eating it?

01:04:39.410 --> 01:04:43.820
Who cares if a few are missing
when there are thousands already?

01:04:44.510 --> 01:04:45.650
But you need to ask for the approval first!

01:04:48.680 --> 01:04:51.890
Are these yours?
Don't fucking tell me what to do!

01:04:52.790 --> 01:04:53.460
I told you not to eat!

01:04:53.820 --> 01:04:54.820
Fuck You!

01:04:58.830 --> 01:04:59.670
I will eat anyway...

01:05:01.690 --> 01:05:02.540
Dong-go! Are you there?

01:05:02.730 --> 01:05:03.830
You have a customer.

01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:14.410
Hi...Wow, it's suit!

01:05:14.840 --> 01:05:17.880
Do you sell the cake here?

01:05:20.550 --> 01:05:22.720
Kids...crazy for this.

01:05:24.050 --> 01:05:24.760
Is it so?

01:05:27.620 --> 01:05:28.330
Thanks.

01:05:34.860 --> 01:05:35.530
Unkie!

01:05:37.060 --> 01:05:37.840
Way to go!

01:05:39.100 --> 01:05:39.800
Thank you.

01:05:43.100 --> 01:05:48.850
General, let them die with honor as
the nation's revolutionary soldiers.

01:05:49.640 --> 01:05:50.350
With honor?

01:05:50.840 --> 01:05:54.450
They would dedicate their lives
for the glory of the great Republic.

01:05:55.550 --> 01:05:59.520
Let them rather kill themselves
than to be executed as traitors.

01:06:03.520 --> 01:06:05.090
Are you sure about that?

01:06:05.830 --> 01:06:10.040
I will kill them all myself
in case of any contumacy!

01:06:21.870 --> 01:06:29.520
I'm sorry, Dong-go. But I did
some background check on you.

01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:33.660
Things about your past...
The birthplace and other stuff.

01:06:35.720 --> 01:06:37.630
But it wasn't easy.

01:06:38.760 --> 01:06:41.760
Nothing is left on database.
They couldn't track down anything.

01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:47.770
I really wanted to find
the past for you.

01:06:48.030 --> 01:06:53.750
I'm not good enough any more.
But don't be disappointed.

01:06:54.710 --> 01:06:58.810
It doesn't matter who you were
or what you have done before.

01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:03.450
What matters is who you're now.

01:07:06.050 --> 01:07:07.430
Too...difficult...

01:07:08.020 --> 01:07:12.440
It's okay. Just remember
I said something cool to you.

01:07:34.810 --> 01:07:37.560
Mother, how are you?

01:07:38.720 --> 01:07:40.890
I am doing just great.

01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:45.670
I miss your smile so much.

01:08:22.830 --> 01:08:24.670
Last mission for soldiers of 5446,
COMMIT SUICIDE.

01:08:24.859 --> 01:08:29.680
In case of contumacy, surveillant
should kill others and commit suicide.

01:08:38.950 --> 01:08:41.430
I didn't run away 'cause I was scared.

01:08:41.680 --> 01:08:45.960
I know. We are the last ones in our team.

01:08:47.450 --> 01:08:48.760
I only have one bullet left,

01:08:50.859 --> 01:08:51.660
let's depart together.

01:08:53.560 --> 01:08:56.600
Hail to the reunification!

01:08:59.770 --> 01:09:01.870
Hail to the reunification!

01:09:07.870 --> 01:09:10.680
Hail to the reunification!

01:09:12.350 --> 01:09:14.090
But why did the Party order us...

01:09:16.420 --> 01:09:19.790
No questions permitted!
Do you fear the death?

01:09:21.689 --> 01:09:23.830
As long as my family is well,

01:09:25.490 --> 01:09:27.060
I'll gladly devote my life for the country.

01:09:28.060 --> 01:09:29.700
First, I need to talk to Chief Trainer.

01:09:30.760 --> 01:09:32.000
This can be regarded as the contumacy!

01:09:36.100 --> 01:09:37.710
Why did you let me live then?

01:09:39.609 --> 01:09:45.490
I will survive all the obstacles!
Please take me into Five Star Troop.

01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:53.720
With an inch deeper,
it will make you limp forever.

01:09:55.720 --> 01:09:58.360
Don't forget how painful it is
when you get wounded.

01:09:59.130 --> 01:10:03.940
If you survive all this pain,
I will take you in.

01:10:11.670 --> 01:10:13.380
If you hadn't stabbed me,

01:10:15.070 --> 01:10:16.990
I wouldn't be alive until now.

01:10:19.110 --> 01:10:20.780
Then...this wouldn't be happening.

01:10:28.420 --> 01:10:32.530
Let me hear your last words
as the surveillant of this area.

01:10:33.790 --> 01:10:36.070
Don't be stupid, take the gun away.

01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:39.600
What did I tell you, Ryu-hwan?

01:10:40.100 --> 01:10:44.980
We're just like those anchovies.
No one will care if we disappear.

01:10:46.470 --> 01:10:48.080
You rebellious bastards!

01:10:48.770 --> 01:10:52.750
You became the dogs of the South!
I will kill you all, traitors!

01:10:53.650 --> 01:10:54.820
Watch your mouth!

01:11:01.450 --> 01:11:04.770
I will kill you traitors!

01:11:18.740 --> 01:11:19.810
He's my team member, let me handle him.

01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:24.820
You can survive only by
killing me. Come get me!

01:11:47.570 --> 01:11:48.040
Shoot it.

01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:52.350
When the Party commands, do not hesitate.

01:11:56.580 --> 01:11:58.080
You think I can't shoot?

01:12:06.490 --> 01:12:10.730
The bravest warrior shouldn't be
swayed by the personal feelings.

01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:12.870
Then you want me to kill you?

01:12:13.690 --> 01:12:14.500
Shut up and shoot me!

01:12:16.700 --> 01:12:17.900
What can I do?

01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:29.780
Captain...

01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:34.090
Don't be afraid.

01:12:39.590 --> 01:12:40.720
It's not your fault. There must be a way.

01:12:45.790 --> 01:12:46.830
Little childish ones...

01:13:04.780 --> 01:13:07.590
Chief, I found it in the body.

01:13:16.520 --> 01:13:19.730
This was your so called advantageous card?

01:13:20.730 --> 01:13:21.800
We have to stop them!

01:13:22.630 --> 01:13:24.700
It's none of our business.

01:13:25.060 --> 01:13:26.100
There are only three left.

01:13:27.670 --> 01:13:28.640
They are still young.

01:13:28.700 --> 01:13:29.840
Just follow the order!

01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:31.810
- Their life is more important!
- Chief SEO! Listen to me!

01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:48.430
Comrade, do me a favor.
Sing me a song, will you?

01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:52.330
It's so sudden. Which song?

01:13:54.660 --> 01:13:55.870
It's someone's favorite number.

01:13:59.100 --> 01:13:59.800
It's called LIMJIN RIVER.

01:14:01.900 --> 01:14:04.780
Hey, it's a forbidden song.

01:14:32.700 --> 01:14:38.380
Dear mother, I don't know
if I could write again.

01:14:40.440 --> 01:14:43.650
I am assigned with a big mission.

01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:46.820
When I accomplish it successfully,
I might be hero...

01:15:03.900 --> 01:15:04.600
But I can't go back home myself...

01:15:04.700 --> 01:15:06.010
Pls take my heart home for me...
or at least I could come back to you.

01:15:08.500 --> 01:15:15.110
Please take care until then.

01:15:45.640 --> 01:15:46.340
Come out!

01:15:54.750 --> 01:15:56.490
State your rank!

01:16:09.930 --> 01:16:14.670
We only have to follow,
not fight against them.

01:16:15.030 --> 01:16:16.070
Why are you afraid? He's just a kid.

01:16:28.780 --> 01:16:29.820
I won't ask twice.

01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:32.760
Other two captains are being followed, too?

01:16:34.090 --> 01:16:37.970
Just kill me, you dirty turncoat!

01:17:04.120 --> 01:17:05.030
You came to kill me?

01:17:07.620 --> 01:17:08.430
No, to save you.

01:17:12.660 --> 01:17:14.700
I'm Chief SEO at NIS,
policy towards North Korea team.

01:17:15.860 --> 01:17:19.040
You're our enemies, but
I don't want you to be dead.

01:17:19.930 --> 01:17:23.540
Your country deserted you,
then why can't you desert it?

01:17:23.900 --> 01:17:28.370
You can desert your mother
if you don't like her?

01:17:28.770 --> 01:17:30.380
I'm from 5446, too.

01:17:31.380 --> 01:17:33.010
You remind me of my brother.
I lost him when escaping from North.

01:17:34.850 --> 01:17:35.550
Just bugger off.

01:17:39.520 --> 01:17:40.690
Do I have to arrest you?

01:17:50.360 --> 01:17:52.100
I'm here to help you, idiots!

01:17:54.930 --> 01:17:55.600
Don't follow him!

01:17:55.830 --> 01:17:56.680
Have to get rid of him now.

01:18:02.070 --> 01:18:02.780
Dong-go!

01:18:06.750 --> 01:18:07.310
Uncle?!

01:18:24.500 --> 01:18:27.000
Hide me, I ran away while
I was being sent to the North.

01:18:29.770 --> 01:18:30.080
What?

01:18:43.850 --> 01:18:44.690
Arrest him.

01:19:13.010 --> 01:19:14.080
Damn bastard!

01:19:18.920 --> 01:19:19.950
It's a positioning device.

01:19:20.820 --> 01:19:23.460
It tells your location and
if you're dead or alive.

01:19:24.560 --> 01:19:28.870
Checked the temperature?
it loses signal under 20 Celsius.

01:19:29.830 --> 01:19:30.070
Chief!

01:19:31.530 --> 01:19:32.100
Bury it in the mountain.

01:19:32.530 --> 01:19:32.980
Yes, sir.

01:19:34.830 --> 01:19:35.070
Speaking.

01:19:35.500 --> 01:19:37.410
Son of a bitch! Return now.
I said no independent action!

01:19:37.740 --> 01:19:38.540
Answer me, Chief SEO!

01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:40.910
Stay here.

01:19:41.110 --> 01:19:44.520
WON will be moving soon.

01:20:00.830 --> 01:20:03.640
I see what happened. So what will you do?

01:20:06.100 --> 01:20:08.370
Don't we have to
take the guns in the closet?

01:20:20.910 --> 01:20:26.360
Remember Prof. SUH opposed to
found 5446 Unit 16 years ago?

01:20:26.720 --> 01:20:31.930
He said that soldiers trained
with priority in combat capability

01:20:32.520 --> 01:20:37.840
have higher possibility of detection
when exposed to new environment.

01:20:38.930 --> 01:20:41.840
The bastard was damn sure about his theory.

01:20:42.430 --> 01:20:45.710
So I sent him to the South
to make him prove himself.

01:20:46.710 --> 01:20:50.550
He might have been right.

01:20:51.740 --> 01:20:55.690
Got a report this morning?

01:20:56.820 --> 01:21:00.090
Done deal with the South.

01:21:00.850 --> 01:21:04.930
Contact SUH when you get there.

01:21:06.730 --> 01:21:07.670
Accomplish the mission as you promised.

01:21:41.690 --> 01:21:42.600
What's up, Dong-go.

01:21:43.800 --> 01:21:47.830
I'm going to see my mom, I want to look neat.

01:22:41.620 --> 01:22:42.620
Good morning!

01:22:46.790 --> 01:22:47.360
<i>You-rank!</i>

01:22:54.670 --> 01:22:58.110
Discuss everything with Yoo-joon.

01:22:59.870 --> 01:23:00.680
What?

01:23:01.710 --> 01:23:04.020
He's more mature than you think.

01:23:05.780 --> 01:23:06.760
Ah...right.

01:23:21.790 --> 01:23:22.530
<i>YOON Yum-mun.</i>

01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:28.070
Stop meaningless fistfights
and study hard at school

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:31.810
if you really want to
look after your sister well.

01:23:40.380 --> 01:23:42.790
Sis, did you see him?

01:23:43.780 --> 01:23:46.790
She looks even prettier
thinking it's last time.

01:23:47.750 --> 01:23:52.330
I really wanted to play on
a seasaw with her one time.

01:23:58.560 --> 01:24:00.510
What? Want more rice?

01:24:01.900 --> 01:24:06.510
L...have to go back where I belong.

01:24:10.010 --> 01:24:12.820
I'm leaving today.

01:24:16.410 --> 01:24:18.660
The soup gets cold.
Finish your meal first.

01:24:19.580 --> 01:24:22.690
Don't skip your meals. Go ahead.

01:24:24.390 --> 01:24:24.800
Yes.

01:24:36.840 --> 01:24:38.780
You were wearing this
when you first got here.

01:24:40.840 --> 01:24:43.790
An account note is in your pocket.
Use it when you go home.

01:24:44.580 --> 01:24:47.790
I guess you blamed me
not paying you enough.

01:24:49.350 --> 01:24:50.920
I haven't done much work... I can't take it,

01:24:52.980 --> 01:24:56.630
Save it for Doo-seok.

01:24:57.520 --> 01:24:59.730
Take it as your severance pay, fool.

01:25:04.830 --> 01:25:08.040
I'm well off without it.

01:25:08.700 --> 01:25:09.870
Now get off. Need to watch TV.

01:25:23.820 --> 01:25:25.350
I managed to get in Seoul

01:25:25.880 --> 01:25:29.460
Mister, are you okay?

01:25:30.060 --> 01:25:31.590
Wake up!

01:25:31.690 --> 01:25:34.900
I have to find Comrade SUH Sang-go.

01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:37.840
Are you alright?

01:25:39.060 --> 01:25:42.530
I need to stay awake.
I'm in enemy's territory.

01:25:47.870 --> 01:25:48.680
Mother.

01:25:58.680 --> 01:26:03.390
Please get an operation
if you really want to be well off.

01:26:05.860 --> 01:26:09.030
Before it's too late.

01:26:14.800 --> 01:26:18.340
It's not working again.

01:27:00.480 --> 01:27:01.350
Quit smoking, bitch!

01:27:02.510 --> 01:27:06.430
I will pay you later, don't need to cuss.

01:27:07.090 --> 01:27:12.800
Holly shit...what's up with her?
It's just a petty tab.

01:27:12.990 --> 01:27:17.870
Can't even find a cigarette butt.

01:27:18.630 --> 01:27:20.800
Quit smoking. It kills you.

01:27:27.410 --> 01:27:27.780
Dong-go, is it you?

01:27:30.340 --> 01:27:32.020
You had your haircut?

01:27:37.080 --> 01:27:39.650
I want cigarette, not popsicles.

01:27:39.780 --> 01:27:41.660
You know that thing with smoke...

01:27:41.790 --> 01:27:43.530
It will be enough to buy a ticket.

01:27:49.660 --> 01:27:50.570
Your adopted kid.

01:27:53.830 --> 01:27:54.780
Here's the address.

01:27:57.540 --> 01:28:00.040
- How did you...
- Go see him.

01:28:02.140 --> 01:28:03.620
Be brave for this once.

01:28:07.050 --> 01:28:10.650
And pay your tab when you get back.

01:28:15.020 --> 01:28:15.690
Cover yourself a bit.

01:28:39.710 --> 01:28:43.660
Though it was my mission to apprehend

01:28:44.650 --> 01:28:47.790
I came to know too much

01:28:48.720 --> 01:28:52.360
of people in this neighborhood.

01:28:56.390 --> 01:28:57.430
You made up your mind.

01:28:59.030 --> 01:29:02.770
- Hae-jin's caught by NIS.
- Good for him.

01:29:03.940 --> 01:29:07.410
- What?
- At least they won't kill him.

01:29:10.710 --> 01:29:11.710
Can he survive here?

01:29:12.480 --> 01:29:16.820
He will live but never fit in.
Even in dozens of years...

01:29:17.880 --> 01:29:18.690
Why is that?

01:29:19.680 --> 01:29:21.460
Only one thing matters to him.

01:29:22.390 --> 01:29:22.960
It's WON Ryu-hwan.

01:29:24.890 --> 01:29:26.370
Stop nonsense. Follow me.

01:29:29.060 --> 01:29:29.660
Where are you going?

01:29:35.870 --> 01:29:36.900
Still keep an eye on WON?

01:29:37.470 --> 01:29:38.970
Yes, no irregular moves so far.

01:29:56.450 --> 01:29:57.060
<i>Haws LEE Haefim'?</i>

01:29:58.490 --> 01:29:58.970
WON Ryu-hwan?

01:29:59.720 --> 01:30:03.070
He's still a kid. Take him

01:30:03.830 --> 01:30:05.930
as your younger brother.

01:30:06.870 --> 01:30:08.470
You don't afford the luxury
to worry about other people now.

01:30:09.900 --> 01:30:13.410
Chief! KIM Tae-won of 5446 Unit
has come to Seoul!

01:30:15.470 --> 01:30:18.420
Listen to me, KIM Tae-won's here.

01:30:18.840 --> 01:30:20.650
This is your last chance to live.
Turn yourself in!

01:30:20.980 --> 01:30:24.720
You cannot run away with
GPS devices in your bodies.

01:30:31.520 --> 01:30:32.090
What's going on?

01:30:32.890 --> 01:30:34.430
They put GPS devices in our bodies.

01:30:34.860 --> 01:30:36.840
Those will lead Comrade Chief to us.

01:30:38.730 --> 01:30:41.770
Great. We needed to meet him anyway.

01:30:42.600 --> 01:30:45.980
Not here! We can't put people
here in danger 'cause of us.

01:30:46.970 --> 01:30:47.880
Let's move to somewhere else.

01:30:50.410 --> 01:30:51.610
I told you not to fucking
tell me what to do!

01:30:52.680 --> 01:30:53.680
Send the Special Unit #1.

01:30:55.380 --> 01:30:56.520
But the director said...

01:30:56.750 --> 01:30:57.450
I will take the responsibility.

01:31:03.050 --> 01:31:04.760
KIM Tae-won is here.

01:31:06.360 --> 01:31:09.700
I will catch him as well as WON Ryu-hwan.

01:31:14.800 --> 01:31:15.870
You cannot catch captain.

01:31:20.770 --> 01:31:21.980
So...finally up to talk?

01:31:23.680 --> 01:31:27.620
Get some treatment and finish
the statement until I am back.

01:31:30.010 --> 01:31:30.790
Take me.

01:31:33.590 --> 01:31:35.590
To where captain is.

01:31:38.820 --> 01:31:40.830
I can desert my country if you'd tell me to.

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:48.070
I can catch these bastards
from the North for you.

01:31:50.570 --> 01:31:52.810
You can use me as hostage.

01:31:55.140 --> 01:31:56.710
Please take me with you.

01:32:05.350 --> 01:32:05.830
Dirty bastard!

01:32:30.540 --> 01:32:32.780
How have you been,
Comrade Senior Colonel?

01:32:34.450 --> 01:32:35.920
I won't blame you.

01:32:37.080 --> 01:32:38.620
This is your last chance

01:32:39.450 --> 01:32:41.050
to serve our great nation.

01:32:42.090 --> 01:32:43.460
Tell me one thing.

01:32:44.860 --> 01:32:46.460
If I serve that command,

01:32:47.360 --> 01:32:49.700
will the Republic look after
my mother like until now?

01:32:49.860 --> 01:32:53.780
Cut your bullshit! You damn traitor!

01:32:54.870 --> 01:32:57.510
Please answer me, Comrade!

01:32:57.870 --> 01:33:02.680
The command from the nation
is unconditional.

01:33:03.410 --> 01:33:04.680
One more word from you, then
I'll proceed a summary execution!

01:33:06.110 --> 01:33:07.350
Let me rephrase my question.

01:33:08.680 --> 01:33:14.100
Is my mother alive at least?

01:33:17.490 --> 01:33:18.020
Execute!

01:33:40.410 --> 01:33:41.010
Answer me!

01:33:45.850 --> 01:33:46.590
Pull the trigger!

01:33:48.650 --> 01:33:49.630
Answer me!

01:33:51.460 --> 01:33:52.940
I taught you never to hesitate!

01:34:43.670 --> 01:34:44.080
No! Don't come!

01:34:49.480 --> 01:34:49.920
It's Dong-saw!

01:34:52.850 --> 01:34:53.560
No, it's not.

01:34:54.420 --> 01:34:55.450
Yes, I'm Dong-go

01:34:56.090 --> 01:34:58.660
- See? It's him
- Go away quickly!

01:34:59.690 --> 01:35:03.970
- Why? You're gonna poop again?
- Yes, so just go.

01:35:08.500 --> 01:35:12.110
You shouldn't shit
where people can see you.

01:35:15.940 --> 01:35:18.010
It's mom's umbrella.

01:35:30.490 --> 01:35:30.830
Get in the car!

01:35:33.720 --> 01:35:34.330
Quick!

01:35:36.390 --> 01:35:38.430
What the hell
are the boys doing here?

01:36:00.080 --> 01:36:00.720
Smash it!

01:36:01.990 --> 01:36:02.620
Block it!

01:36:32.780 --> 01:36:33.760
You'd better open up.

01:36:38.490 --> 01:36:38.900
Get off quick!

01:36:42.790 --> 01:36:43.530
Run to the barber shop!

01:36:46.860 --> 01:36:51.110
- What about you?
- Come on quick, fool!

01:36:53.740 --> 01:36:54.720
I'm not a scary person, Chi-woong.

01:36:55.610 --> 01:36:56.740
Listen to me, Chi-woong.

01:37:00.410 --> 01:37:04.790
Look after your mom and brother.

01:37:05.080 --> 01:37:06.930
It's the big boy's job.

01:37:07.620 --> 01:37:08.060
Understand?

01:37:09.420 --> 01:37:09.830
NOW, go!

01:37:14.660 --> 01:37:17.730
- When is he coming back?
- Dunno, soon I guess.

01:37:22.130 --> 01:37:23.040
Is your back alright?

01:37:24.970 --> 01:37:25.780
Just a brush burn.

01:37:32.880 --> 01:37:35.550
Guess we're starting the war now?

01:37:57.440 --> 01:37:59.420
Fantastic location choice
to pick up the weapons!

01:38:16.690 --> 01:38:17.560
Uncle!

01:38:19.690 --> 01:38:20.630
Here.

01:38:24.800 --> 01:38:26.100
Now let's kill them all!

01:38:32.870 --> 01:38:33.610
Are you sure it's the right bag?

01:38:35.610 --> 01:38:38.640
Is this a fucking joke?
What can we do with this?

01:38:39.680 --> 01:38:41.680
You know...l was sure.

01:38:43.650 --> 01:38:48.720
Now it's proved right
as you betray the nation.

01:38:49.720 --> 01:38:52.530
What are you talking about?

01:38:53.090 --> 01:38:56.700
Let me introduce myself.

01:38:58.400 --> 01:39:02.340
I'm SUH Young-guk. Prof. of Political
Philosophy at University Kim ll-sung.

01:39:09.810 --> 01:39:10.810
How do you feel,

01:39:11.810 --> 01:39:12.840
you traitors?

01:39:14.850 --> 01:39:18.880
I heard a professor opposed to
the foundation of 5446 Unit.

01:39:19.750 --> 01:39:20.630
Was that you?

01:39:20.680 --> 01:39:23.690
You never deserved the title
of 'Revolutionary Soldiers'!

01:39:24.120 --> 01:39:24.960
Comrade SUH Sang-go...

01:39:25.790 --> 01:39:30.360
You will be buried here,
there's no run away.

01:39:35.100 --> 01:39:38.840
You gave these as weapons.
Better to use them that way.

01:39:39.900 --> 01:39:43.650
Long time no see, CHOI.

01:39:44.410 --> 01:39:47.820
I follow the order from the Party.

01:39:48.380 --> 01:39:49.520
I know. Just do your job.

01:39:50.350 --> 01:39:53.020
Then I'll do mine.

01:39:54.020 --> 01:39:54.720
Shoot them.

01:40:01.730 --> 01:40:02.730
What the fuck are you doing?

01:40:03.630 --> 01:40:07.670
CHOI Wan-woo!
Kill them!

01:40:08.030 --> 01:40:08.700
Attack!

01:40:17.510 --> 01:40:18.750
What are you doing?

01:40:30.820 --> 01:40:31.420
You wanna die?

01:42:18.700 --> 01:42:19.470
Shall we stop here?

01:42:25.570 --> 01:42:29.710
Do we need to survive
over our brothers' blood?

01:42:32.440 --> 01:42:35.750
Maybe I should follow the Party
that looks after my mother.

01:42:36.650 --> 01:42:38.390
You stupid asshole!

01:42:39.850 --> 01:42:43.700
All the family of 5446 Unit soldiers

01:42:45.420 --> 01:42:47.730
were imprisoned in the camp
when you joined the Unit.

01:42:50.430 --> 01:42:51.000
What?

01:42:53.600 --> 01:42:57.550
And now when you're all
ordered to kill yourselves,

01:42:58.800 --> 01:43:00.480
you expect your family to be alive?

01:43:00.800 --> 01:43:02.910
Shut up, Comrade SUH!

01:43:04.340 --> 01:43:07.050
You scumbags who'd betray
the nation for mere bread.

01:43:08.610 --> 01:43:11.020
5446 Unit is a total failure!

01:43:12.680 --> 01:43:13.820
That can't be true...

01:43:14.820 --> 01:43:17.990
Ryu-hwan, wake up!

01:43:18.590 --> 01:43:23.440
You still don't get it?
Your mother's already executed!

01:43:27.560 --> 01:43:28.700
I have no mom to look after.

01:43:30.630 --> 01:43:32.810
No regrets if I live and die cool.

01:43:34.940 --> 01:43:35.640
So here I come!

01:43:36.510 --> 01:43:36.810
Stop him!

01:43:56.130 --> 01:43:59.600
What's up with you,
great revolutionary soldier?

01:44:05.740 --> 01:44:07.810
I have a question.

01:44:08.770 --> 01:44:11.650
I prefer talking, too.

01:44:11.910 --> 01:44:15.690
My sister got out of the camp
the day you came here.

01:44:16.680 --> 01:44:18.060
Did you get her out?

01:44:19.080 --> 01:44:20.650
I just wanted to see her.

01:44:21.890 --> 01:44:24.700
I might've wanted to ask her out

01:44:25.790 --> 01:44:28.500
if she was as pretty as you bragged.

01:44:35.770 --> 01:44:38.580
Damn liar! She looks exactly like you!

01:44:39.840 --> 01:44:43.010
So I came down heart-free!

01:44:44.510 --> 01:44:48.850
- My mother...
- Miss your mom that much?

01:44:50.810 --> 01:44:54.790
Why don't you follow her?
Go where she is now!

01:44:57.890 --> 01:44:58.660
Captain CHOI! Captain CHOI!

01:44:59.120 --> 01:45:00.630
That can't be true! It must not be true!

01:45:06.600 --> 01:45:08.800
Sniper, sniper!

01:45:15.670 --> 01:45:16.710
Shoot dirty traitors, all of them!

01:45:28.890 --> 01:45:30.460
Ryu-hwan, come to your senses!

01:45:33.890 --> 01:45:35.870
I did everything for the Republic...

01:45:38.500 --> 01:45:39.800
I even became a monster.

01:45:40.360 --> 01:45:41.400
We have to get out of here.

01:45:41.770 --> 01:45:43.710
Ryu-hwan, let's go!

01:45:46.770 --> 01:45:47.680
Comrade Captain!

01:46:10.130 --> 01:46:10.830
Vehicle #2! Go-astern!

01:46:12.730 --> 01:46:13.670
What are you doing?

01:46:45.730 --> 01:46:48.540
Comrade Colonel, what took you so long?

01:46:49.070 --> 01:46:50.700
You should've protected me.

01:46:51.500 --> 01:46:54.780
I will report this to the Party.

01:46:55.340 --> 01:46:56.680
Better be prepared!

01:46:57.470 --> 01:47:00.350
Revolutionary soldiers?

01:47:09.850 --> 01:47:10.800
These traitors?

01:47:11.690 --> 01:47:12.100
Got it. So shut the fuck up.

01:47:28.110 --> 01:47:29.520
All the snipers are eliminated.

01:47:29.910 --> 01:47:30.510
Who is it?

01:47:31.070 --> 01:47:32.640
Go save the captain quickly!

01:47:38.480 --> 01:47:41.430
The great soldiers of the Republic!

01:47:43.390 --> 01:47:46.060
Listen up. We will all die here together.

01:47:48.390 --> 01:47:51.810
Give the peace to your comrades
who cannot move.

01:47:55.530 --> 01:47:57.740
Please, don't kill me!

01:48:05.840 --> 01:48:07.450
You'd better stay out of this.

01:48:08.780 --> 01:48:13.590
One more step further, I will take it
as declaration of war and destroy you all.

01:48:14.520 --> 01:48:16.660
KIM Tae-won! Don't try a foolish act!

01:48:18.720 --> 01:48:19.500
Shit!

01:48:22.830 --> 01:48:23.400
Evacuate!

01:48:47.820 --> 01:48:49.730
CHOI Won-woo, you stupid fella.

01:48:52.860 --> 01:48:54.060
Why did you follow me?

01:48:56.860 --> 01:48:57.860
Comrade Captain...

01:48:59.830 --> 01:49:08.110
You got all the families of
our team out of the camp.

01:49:09.570 --> 01:49:10.610
I knew it. Thank you so much.

01:49:13.780 --> 01:49:16.850
Please survive...

01:49:38.740 --> 01:49:43.510
Comrade WON, do me a favor.

01:49:45.680 --> 01:49:51.520
Let's compete here again who's
the best soldier of 5446 Unit.

01:49:54.720 --> 01:49:58.760
If we were lucky enough that
one of us is allowed to survive,

01:50:01.630 --> 01:50:02.760
let that be you.

01:50:06.360 --> 01:50:12.750
I don't have the smallest regret in this life.

01:50:31.020 --> 01:50:32.060
Congratulations for passing
Vocalist Audition, Mr. Hae-rang.

01:50:32.520 --> 01:50:34.370
Further details to be sent via e-mail.

01:50:36.090 --> 01:50:37.700
Damn...l passed the audition.

01:50:40.730 --> 01:50:43.970
Apparently my voice works
better than my guitar.

01:50:50.810 --> 01:50:51.480
Shall we...

01:50:53.110 --> 01:50:54.050
die here?

01:50:57.850 --> 01:51:01.660
Or try to live a new life?

01:51:38.890 --> 01:51:42.000
Well, I guess it's time for the grand final.

01:51:55.570 --> 01:51:56.450
Put him on!

01:51:59.740 --> 01:52:01.550
He will listen to your last words.

01:52:04.010 --> 01:52:05.580
It's General LEE Moo-hyuk.

01:52:08.050 --> 01:52:11.690
Who knows? Try to beg for life.

01:52:24.770 --> 01:52:27.650
Wish you a long life, Comrade General!

01:52:29.140 --> 01:52:31.680
Stop being cocky,

01:52:33.880 --> 01:52:36.520
you're a mere bastard son
from his concubine!

01:52:37.810 --> 01:52:39.790
Everyone in the troop knows

01:52:40.820 --> 01:52:44.360
that your mom lived like a beggar

01:52:45.560 --> 01:52:48.330
after she got deserted by LEE,
and gave birth to you in pigsty.

01:52:50.030 --> 01:52:51.870
You damn bastard!
What a talkative asshole.

01:52:54.800 --> 01:52:58.750
Comrade WON,
I can't run as my leg was shot.

01:52:59.540 --> 01:53:03.950
Just get me that bastard

01:53:18.360 --> 01:53:19.100
alive.

01:53:26.500 --> 01:53:27.740
Remember what I said?

01:53:28.870 --> 01:53:30.640
There are only two conditions

01:53:31.900 --> 01:53:33.710
that we would meet again.

01:53:34.370 --> 01:53:38.720
Sure. Either as brothers
when we achieve re-unification,

01:53:39.810 --> 01:53:42.420
or as enemies to kill each other.

01:53:50.650 --> 01:53:52.000
I had a faith in you.

01:53:53.090 --> 01:53:56.630
But you end up being a traitor?

01:54:05.100 --> 01:54:06.880
I only entrusted you my mom.

01:54:10.010 --> 01:54:11.780
Was that too much of asking?

01:54:13.440 --> 01:54:18.360
What matters more to you?
Your mother or your country?

01:54:18.980 --> 01:54:22.730
What matters to the country, then?

01:54:26.460 --> 01:54:27.030
Just execute him.

01:55:03.130 --> 01:55:04.760
You told me to stay alive.

01:55:08.030 --> 01:55:09.340
I will serve the command.

01:55:40.030 --> 01:55:42.510
Didn't I teach you to keep
your movements simple?

01:57:12.690 --> 01:57:14.570
Never fire before my order!

01:57:15.020 --> 01:57:15.800
Guards up!

01:57:37.950 --> 01:57:39.520
Do you fear the death?

01:57:41.050 --> 01:57:45.360
Have you ever taught us fear?

01:57:58.470 --> 01:58:00.610
Cease the fire! Who's that son of a bitch?

01:58:29.430 --> 01:58:33.710
What ruined all of you like this?

01:58:34.940 --> 01:58:39.890
I just wanted to stay close to

01:58:42.480 --> 01:58:45.550
people of my dream, my saviors...

01:58:46.980 --> 01:58:51.060
Forgive me, Comrade Chief.

01:59:11.740 --> 01:59:14.480
You are not proud soldiers
of the Republic any more

01:59:15.910 --> 01:59:20.950
if you're swayed by personal feelings.

01:59:22.690 --> 01:59:26.690
You are still my pride
and our people's pride!

01:59:27.690 --> 01:59:34.770
Let's die together here
for the honor of the country!

01:59:36.130 --> 01:59:39.380
Shut up! Life is not a big deal.

01:59:41.700 --> 01:59:44.510
No regret if you lived cool.

01:59:47.810 --> 01:59:49.050
Let me play the hero!

01:59:55.720 --> 01:59:57.060
It was damn fun!

02:00:12.970 --> 02:00:13.880
Captain Hae-rang.

02:00:19.980 --> 02:00:20.650
What the fuck is going on?

02:00:21.010 --> 02:00:22.610
Order changed! Arrest all!

02:00:22.710 --> 02:00:23.490
Onward!

02:00:34.890 --> 02:00:35.560
Put your guns down!

02:00:38.630 --> 02:00:40.510
- Let me handle it.
- Sir!

02:00:43.100 --> 02:00:48.110
<i>WON Ryukrwarr, LEE Haeiyrr?.
You two surrender new'.!</i>

02:00:48.810 --> 02:00:50.310
Shut up, you scumbag!

02:00:55.010 --> 02:00:58.720
Go ahead, captain! The building has lots
of structures on outside wall.

02:00:58.850 --> 02:01:00.920
You can use them and escape.

02:01:01.780 --> 02:01:03.560
I will earn some time for you.

02:01:07.920 --> 02:01:09.530
Get to yourself, WON Ryu-hwan!

02:01:10.060 --> 02:01:13.400
Don't you see that?
Hae-rang died just for us!

02:01:14.730 --> 02:01:18.770
Move yourself! Wake up!

02:01:20.700 --> 02:01:22.110
Wake up! Get to your senses!

02:01:31.710 --> 02:01:32.660
I want to go back...

02:01:43.430 --> 02:01:46.500
An account note is in your pocket.
Use it when you go home.

02:01:59.380 --> 02:02:00.510
SAVINGS ACCOUNT NOTE

02:02:09.750 --> 02:02:12.430
DONG-GU'S WAGE, $200

02:02:13.460 --> 02:02:16.700
MY SECOND SON'S WAGE, $300

02:02:24.500 --> 02:02:28.310
SAVINGS FOR
MY SON'S WEDDING, $400

02:03:22.630 --> 02:03:23.730
I want to go back...

02:03:27.600 --> 02:03:28.970
Want to live like before!

02:03:47.020 --> 02:03:49.930
Stupid idiot. I doubt he took the umbrella.

02:03:55.760 --> 02:03:58.760
POLICE CHO DOO-SEOK

02:03:59.630 --> 02:04:00.660
Crazy bugger.

02:04:07.870 --> 02:04:10.540
FOR BELATED RENT

02:04:26.020 --> 02:04:30.770
- Where's Dong-go?
- Dunno.

02:04:49.610 --> 02:04:52.720
Listen to me, LEE Hae-jin. Drop the gun.

02:04:56.850 --> 02:04:59.360
What are you doing? Arrest them!

02:05:02.630 --> 02:05:03.730
Avert your gun, sons of bitch!

02:05:07.860 --> 02:05:09.810
Kill them all if they resist!

02:05:12.900 --> 02:05:13.810
Stop!

02:05:21.680 --> 02:05:23.550
Stop it, I said stop!

02:05:24.910 --> 02:05:27.050
You can still live,

02:05:27.620 --> 02:05:29.100
LEE Hae-jin, drop the gun!

02:05:29.920 --> 02:05:33.590
Betraying my country doesn't mean that
I'll be your dog!

02:06:50.130 --> 02:06:55.640
Captain, what kind of man
would you be if born again?

02:06:57.010 --> 02:07:05.790
Me? Ordinary man living
in a peaceful country.

02:07:07.020 --> 02:07:08.650
You really dream high!

02:07:08.980 --> 02:07:11.730
What's yours then?

02:07:13.920 --> 02:07:20.500
I wish I could live next door
to your ordinary family.

02:07:23.070 --> 02:07:24.740
You childish ones!

02:07:26.670 --> 02:07:30.520
Then I will be the voluptuous girl
next door to both of yours.

02:07:31.740 --> 02:07:34.550
Keep you dangling and dump you in the end.

02:07:36.450 --> 02:07:36.920
Comrade Hae-rang.

02:07:38.350 --> 02:07:41.090
Don't pass the anchovies over
while you're talking.

02:07:43.350 --> 02:07:44.700
Such a sharp fella...

02:07:49.990 --> 02:07:51.940
You don't miss a thing, do you?

02:07:53.460 --> 02:07:54.460
Stupid fellas...

02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:37.040
Since then people kept
telling me the idiot Dong-go was

02:08:37.610 --> 02:08:42.560
in fact a scary spy WON Ryu-hwan.

02:08:43.750 --> 02:08:45.690
But I can't really imagine.

02:08:46.820 --> 02:08:49.730
In rain or in snow,

02:08:50.520 --> 02:08:52.760
In summer or in winter,

02:08:53.860 --> 02:08:57.830
Dong-go was running around
our small neighborhood.

02:08:59.030 --> 02:09:02.640
Dong-Q“,

02:09:04.130 --> 02:09:12.750
drop me a line if you're alive.

02:09:45.710 --> 02:09:49.550
Don't be ill, mom.
