00:15.600 --> 00:19.036
I'm your big brother.
If I don't teach you this, who will?

00:22.960 --> 00:25.428
- I don't know, Trey. 
- Quit being a little bitch! Get in!

00:27.240 --> 00:28.559
Yeah! Let's go!

00:30.160 --> 00:31.639
Get in!

00:32.479 --> 00:34.755
Come on, let's go, Ryan!

00:46.040 --> 00:48.429
You know, you should
see your face, man!

01:03.880 --> 01:04.995
No! No!

01:08.320 --> 01:10.709
Let me see those hands! Let's go!

01:11.160 --> 01:15.358
Hands up! Get them up! On the dash,
where I can see them. Let's go.

01:30.480 --> 01:33.074
Ryan. Sandy Cohen.

01:33.240 --> 01:36.152
The court's appointed me
your public defender.

01:38.880 --> 01:42.077
You could do worse. You okay?
They treating you all right?

01:42.240 --> 01:44.390
Where's my brother?

01:44.560 --> 01:47.358
Trey is over 18. Trey stole a car.

01:47.520 --> 01:50.796
Trey had a gun in his pants, an ounce
of pot in his jacket, a couple of priors.

01:50.960 --> 01:53.713
I'm guessing right now
Trey is looking at three to five years.

01:53.880 --> 01:55.438
But Trey's not my concern.

01:55.600 --> 01:57.192
This is your first time in lockup.

01:57.360 --> 01:59.635
I'm assuming you don't plan
on coming back.

01:59.800 --> 02:02.473
Your grades are not great.

02:02.640 --> 02:06.110
Suspended twice for fighting,
truancy three times.

02:09.199 --> 02:12.317
Your test scores.
Ninety-eighth percentile on your SAT I's.

02:13.200 --> 02:16.158
Ryan, 98th percentile.
If you start going to class...

02:16.320 --> 02:18.880
Are you thinking about college?

02:19.040 --> 02:21.679
Have you given any thought at all
to your future?

02:21.840 --> 02:25.196
Dude, I'm on your side.

02:25.360 --> 02:26.713
Help me out here, give...

02:26.880 --> 02:32.159
Modern medicine is advancing to the point
where the average life span will be 100.

02:32.320 --> 02:37.553
But I read this article which said Social
Security is supposed to run out by 2025...

02:37.720 --> 02:42.794
...which means people are gonna
have to stay in their jobs until they're 80.

02:45.200 --> 02:48.590
So I don't want to commit
to anything too soon.

02:49.920 --> 02:53.435
Look, I can plea this down
to a misdemeanor. Petty fine, probation.

02:53.600 --> 02:56.160
But stealing a car because
your big brother told you to...

02:56.320 --> 02:57.639
...it's stupid and it's weak.

02:57.800 --> 02:59.756
Those are two things
you can't afford to be anymore.

02:59.920 --> 03:01.592
- Two more things.
- Want to change that?

03:01.760 --> 03:04.479
Then get over the fact
that life dealt you a bad hand.

03:04.640 --> 03:07.200
I get it. We're cut
from the same deck, Ryan.

03:07.360 --> 03:11.638
I grew up with no money, my father
was gone, my mother worked all the time.

03:11.800 --> 03:14.030
I was pissed off, I was stupid.

03:14.200 --> 03:15.838
Look at you now.

03:18.600 --> 03:23.151
Smart kid like you, you gotta
have a plan, some kind of a dream.

03:23.320 --> 03:24.958
Yeah. Right.

03:25.480 --> 03:27.198
Let me tell you something, okay?

03:27.360 --> 03:30.875
Where I'm from, having a dream
doesn't make you smart.

03:31.040 --> 03:33.270
Knowing it won't come true?

03:33.720 --> 03:35.039
That does.

03:36.800 --> 03:39.792
My office will contact you
to remind you of your hearing date.

03:39.960 --> 03:41.871
I'll remember.

03:54.520 --> 03:57.751
Unbelievable.
What kind of family I got, huh?

03:57.920 --> 04:01.879
What the hell did I do to deserve
this family? You want to tell me that?

04:02.040 --> 04:05.112
Mrs. Atwood? I'm Sandy Cohen.
I'm Ryan's attorney.

04:05.280 --> 04:07.350
You should have let him rot in there.

04:07.520 --> 04:11.672
Just like his dad's doing,
and just like his brother's gonna.

04:12.080 --> 04:14.071
Let's go, Ryan.

04:14.840 --> 04:16.591
Now, Ryan!

04:17.360 --> 04:20.476
I'm gonna give you my card
and my home number.

04:20.800 --> 04:24.156
You know, if you need somebody,
if things get to be too much...

04:24.720 --> 04:25.709
...call me.

04:26.160 --> 04:28.469
- Let's go!
- All right.

04:31.520 --> 04:34.353
I can't do this anymore, Ryan.

04:34.520 --> 04:36.272
I can't.

04:36.600 --> 04:39.353
- I'm sorry, Mom.
- I want you out of my house.

04:41.960 --> 04:45.669
- I want you out.
- But, Mom, where am I gonna go?

04:45.840 --> 04:48.798
- You heard your mother, man. Get out.
- This isn't your house, man.

04:49.280 --> 04:52.716
- Oh, you a tough guy now?
- A.J., don't. Ryan, just get out.

04:52.880 --> 04:56.634
You should worry about your own kids
instead of freeloading off my mom.

05:14.480 --> 05:17.756
Hey. Can I crash with you tonight?

05:18.200 --> 05:20.475
Yeah, all right. Fine.

05:22.000 --> 05:27.028
I need a place to crash tonight.
I already tried it. I already tried it!

06:09.080 --> 06:11.878
I told you. You could do worse.

06:46.280 --> 06:49.192
This is a nice car. I didn't know
your kind of lawyer made money.

06:49.360 --> 06:51.828
No, we don't.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.592
My wife does.

06:57.400 --> 06:59.834
Good evening, Mr. Cohen.

07:09.880 --> 07:13.634
You know, why don't you
wait here for a minute. I'll be back.

07:15.240 --> 07:17.913
It's no fun if the key's in the car.

07:19.520 --> 07:22.239
- <i>T- shirt and bumper stickers</i>
<i>from the radio station.</i>

07:22.920 --> 07:25.036
<i>You brought him home?</i>

07:25.600 --> 07:29.115
- This is not a stray puppy, Sandy.
- I know that, Kirsten.

07:29.280 --> 07:32.989
It was only a matter of time before
you started bringing home felons.

07:33.160 --> 07:35.913
- Ryan's not a felon.
- Did you not meet him in jail?

07:36.240 --> 07:39.073
Yes, technically.
But it wasn't for a felony.

07:39.240 --> 07:41.390
It was, but it won't be when I'm done.

07:41.560 --> 07:44.870
You're endangering our home.
Did you even think of Seth?

07:45.040 --> 07:47.918
It's only for the weekend.
Till Child Services opens on Monday.

07:48.080 --> 07:51.595
What if this is all a scam?
What if he's using you to case the house?

07:51.760 --> 07:53.637
He's not a criminal mastermind.

07:53.800 --> 07:56.155
He's a kid who has no one,
and nowhere to go.

07:56.320 --> 07:59.835
- When did you become so cynical?
- When did you become so self-righteous?

08:00.240 --> 08:02.310
I've always been self-righteous.

08:03.160 --> 08:06.550
- You used to find it charming.
- He sleeps in the pool house.

08:06.720 --> 08:09.996
- Where you going?
- To put my jewelry in the vault.

08:11.640 --> 08:13.915
Where do you think I'm going?

08:14.480 --> 08:16.789
The boy's gonna need fresh sheets...

08:16.960 --> 08:19.838
...and towels and a toothbrush.

08:35.760 --> 08:38.672
- Who are you?
- Whoever you want me to be.

08:40.799 --> 08:42.153
Okay.

08:50.560 --> 08:52.630
Hey, can I bum a cigarette?

09:22.920 --> 09:25.115
So, what are you doing here? Seriously.

09:25.640 --> 09:27.039
Seriously?

09:32.800 --> 09:34.791
I stole a car.

09:36.040 --> 09:38.349
Crashed it.

09:39.240 --> 09:41.595
Actually, my brother did.

09:41.760 --> 09:45.196
Since he had a gun and drugs on him,
he's in jail.

09:45.360 --> 09:50.912
I got out, then my mom threw me out.
She was pissed off and drunk.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.558
So Mr. Cohen took me in.

09:56.920 --> 09:59.673
You're their cousin from Boston, right?

10:00.400 --> 10:01.879
Right.

10:02.040 --> 10:04.634
- Hi, Marissa.
- Hey, Mr. Cohen.

10:04.800 --> 10:07.234
I was just meeting your nephew.

10:09.280 --> 10:11.510
My favorite nephew, Ryan.

10:11.680 --> 10:13.796
All the way from Seattle.

10:14.480 --> 10:17.119
- Seattle.
- Dad lives there. Mom lives in Boston.

10:18.120 --> 10:21.396
So we're all really excited about your
fashion show fundraiser tomorrow.

10:21.560 --> 10:23.516
Really? You are?

10:25.120 --> 10:26.917
No.

10:31.040 --> 10:32.837
Come on, let's go.

10:33.280 --> 10:37.114
Hey, you should come by, check it out.
If you don't have other plans.

10:37.280 --> 10:38.679
- See you.
- Good night.

10:45.880 --> 10:47.438
Who's that kid?

10:49.720 --> 10:51.676
Let's go inside.

10:55.920 --> 10:58.388
There's no smoking in this house.

11:07.160 --> 11:09.116
So this is where you'll be staying.

11:09.280 --> 11:11.953
And this is the queen
of the manor herself, my wife, Kirsten.

11:12.120 --> 11:15.078
Hello, Ryan. Welcome to our home.

11:15.240 --> 11:18.835
If you need anything,
Rosie here can help you.

11:20.600 --> 11:22.989
Thank you. Thanks very much.

11:25.360 --> 11:29.148
We'll see you in the morning.
Make yourself comfortable.

12:07.560 --> 12:09.198
Hey.

12:09.760 --> 12:11.432
Hey.

12:14.400 --> 12:16.231
Do you wanna play?

12:17.360 --> 12:20.352
Looks like someone's trying to be
a hero, but he got a little cocky.

12:25.761 --> 12:27.831
What happened to your head, dude?
Where did it go?

12:28.001 --> 12:29.275
I'm sorry. Did someone die?

12:29.441 --> 12:33.719
Hey, want to play "Grand Theft Auto"?
It's pretty cool. You can steal cars and...

12:34.481 --> 12:36.278
Not that that's cool.

12:36.441 --> 12:39.080
- Or uncool, I don't know...
- I see you two have met.

12:39.481 --> 12:41.551
Seth, what are you doing inside
on this beautiful day?

12:41.721 --> 12:44.633
- Why don't you show Ryan around?
- Because it's so great around here.

12:44.801 --> 12:46.029
There's so much to do, Dad.

12:46.201 --> 12:48.192
I don't know,
what do you want to do?

12:48.641 --> 12:50.996
What do you guys do around here?

13:10.521 --> 13:15.595
I have this plan.
I don't know what you'll think.

13:15.761 --> 13:19.117
But next July the trade winds shift west,
and I want to sail to Tahiti.

13:19.281 --> 13:22.353
I could do it in 44 days,
maybe even 42.

13:22.521 --> 13:24.034
Wow, that...

13:24.201 --> 13:27.318
- That sounds really cool, man.
- Yeah.

13:27.801 --> 13:29.393
You just hit the high seas...

13:29.561 --> 13:33.190
...and catch fish off the side of the boat,
grill them right there.

13:33.881 --> 13:35.792
Just total quiet.

13:36.441 --> 13:37.794
Solitude.

13:39.601 --> 13:42.513
- You won't get Ionely?
- Well, I'll have Summer with me.

13:43.321 --> 13:45.551
You're gonna take this to Tahiti?

13:50.601 --> 13:51.590
No.

13:52.321 --> 13:54.994
It's the girl the boat's named after.

13:55.161 --> 13:57.152
She must be pretty stoked.

13:57.441 --> 14:01.957
Yeah. She has no idea.
I've never talked to her before.

14:07.761 --> 14:09.080
Hey, fellas.

14:09.561 --> 14:11.677
I thought we'd head over
to the fashion show at 7.

14:11.841 --> 14:13.240
Yeah. Have fun.

14:13.401 --> 14:17.872
- Come on. It's a whole new school year.
- It's also the same kids, Dad.

14:18.041 --> 14:21.158
Why do they need a fashion show?
Every day is a fashion show for them.

14:21.321 --> 14:23.994
Ryan has to go. Marissa invited him.

14:25.081 --> 14:27.549
Marissa invited you?

14:27.721 --> 14:30.679
I've lived next door
to Marissa since, like, forever.

14:30.841 --> 14:32.797
Her dad almost got married to my mom.

14:32.961 --> 14:35.316
And she's never even invited me
to a birthday.

14:35.481 --> 14:39.156
That is not true.
They did not almost get married.

14:39.321 --> 14:41.516
Maybe Summer would be there.

14:41.681 --> 14:44.753
That's interesting.
She is Marissa's best friend.

14:45.961 --> 14:48.031
- Seven?
- Seven.

15:11.361 --> 15:14.512
- Hello again.
- My dad's not here.

15:14.681 --> 15:17.798
- When can we expect him?
- I don't know.

15:19.481 --> 15:21.233
Well, when you see your father...

15:21.401 --> 15:24.950
...please remind him again
how much we'd like to talk.

15:25.281 --> 15:28.591
Let me leave you another one
of my cards.

15:28.761 --> 15:30.353
Have a good day.

15:43.361 --> 15:45.113
Hey.

15:45.281 --> 15:49.399
Thanks, kiddo. I just didn't have time
to deal with those guys right now.

15:50.601 --> 15:52.432
Who are they?

15:53.881 --> 15:55.473
Suits.

15:55.641 --> 15:57.632
Bureaucrats.

15:58.001 --> 16:00.196
The Man.

16:02.041 --> 16:03.838
But, I mean, everything's okay, right?

16:04.001 --> 16:07.994
Yeah. It's just a...
Just a thing with a client.

16:08.921 --> 16:11.355
Nothing for you to worry about, okay?

16:38.361 --> 16:41.910
Wow, look at that.
It fits you beautifully.

16:42.081 --> 16:43.753
Where's your tie?

16:43.921 --> 16:47.436
I'm not gonna wear one.
Open collar, it's a good look.

16:47.601 --> 16:51.799
I didn't know how to tie a tie till
I was 25. Come on, give me your tie.

16:54.401 --> 16:56.437
Button your top button.

16:58.961 --> 17:00.440
All right. Collar up.

17:00.601 --> 17:04.480
The skinny side has got to be shorter
than the fat side.

17:04.641 --> 17:07.394
How much shorter,
it changes tie to tie.

17:07.560 --> 17:10.233
Sometimes it's just a mystery.

17:11.001 --> 17:12.559
All right.

17:13.481 --> 17:15.994
So you got to hang out with Seth.

17:16.161 --> 17:17.513
How was that? Was that...?

17:17.681 --> 17:19.876
Was that all right?

17:20.281 --> 17:22.192
He's an interesting kid
if you get to know him.

17:22.560 --> 17:24.153
He's cool.

17:26.320 --> 17:27.959
Cool, huh?

17:30.281 --> 17:32.112
All right.

17:32.761 --> 17:35.753
There we go. Turn around.

17:35.921 --> 17:37.559
Look at you.

17:42.321 --> 17:44.232
Beats a jumpsuit.

17:56.281 --> 17:58.192
Oh, Mom, do you like my nails?

17:58.361 --> 18:03.640
I love them, Kaitlin. Do you like my hair
this straight, or is it too Avril Lavigne?

18:03.801 --> 18:05.519
No, it looks good, Mom.

18:05.681 --> 18:07.637
Marissa, you look...

18:07.801 --> 18:10.474
Oh, honey, I thought
you were gonna wear your hair down.

18:10.641 --> 18:13.109
Pulled back like that,
it's harsh on your angles.

18:13.281 --> 18:15.078
Okay. Let's go.

18:15.241 --> 18:16.720
It's gonna be so amazing tonight.

18:16.881 --> 18:19.679
Are you gonna wear the Donna Karan,
Mariss? It's very forgiving.

18:19.841 --> 18:21.593
You look beautiful, kiddo.

18:29.721 --> 18:33.555
Mushroom-leek crescent?
Crab-and-brie filo?

18:36.441 --> 18:38.750
Welcome to the dark side.

18:43.321 --> 18:45.710
So you must be the cousin from Boston.

18:45.881 --> 18:50.318
I don't know how you do it. I could
just never live there. I hate the cold.

18:51.201 --> 18:56.070
Do you like Seattle? I mean,
all that rain. Isn't it depressing?

18:56.241 --> 18:58.960
Did I hear you were from Canada?

18:59.801 --> 19:01.837
Yes, you did.

19:07.801 --> 19:11.555
- Hi. Can I get a 7 and 7?
- Sure.

19:16.761 --> 19:18.513
Thanks.

19:28.681 --> 19:30.478
Thank you.

19:32.281 --> 19:35.637
I want my husband
to be right about you.

19:41.641 --> 19:45.031
- What's up? Lock it up, Nordlund.
- Lock it up, Luke.

19:47.441 --> 19:50.080
Hey, Luke. What's up?

19:50.241 --> 19:52.471
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:53.441 --> 19:55.079
Suck it, queer.

19:57.361 --> 20:01.354
My vacation was great too.
Thank you for asking about it.

20:05.401 --> 20:07.312
Summer's right over there. Don't look.

20:07.481 --> 20:10.359
You can look,
but don't look like you're looking.

20:11.601 --> 20:13.239
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey, guys.

20:13.401 --> 20:15.437
Who is that?

20:15.601 --> 20:19.310
The cousin? The pool boy?
I don't know.

20:19.481 --> 20:21.836
Well, I'm gonna find out.

20:22.001 --> 20:23.832
Is that Summer?

20:24.001 --> 20:26.561
I'm gonna... I'm gonna sit.

20:28.761 --> 20:31.321
Way to salt his game, Mr. Cohen.

20:34.201 --> 20:37.511
Hello, Chester. Are these seats taken?

20:40.041 --> 20:41.235
Okay.

20:50.281 --> 20:54.354
So are you looking forward to your next
sailing lesson? You're making strides.

20:56.441 --> 20:58.671
Okay. I'm glad we had
this little chance to catch up.

21:01.081 --> 21:03.390
Thank you. Thank you.

21:04.441 --> 21:06.796
Thank you all so much for coming.

21:06.961 --> 21:10.510
Every year we do this to raise money
for the battered women's shelter.

21:10.681 --> 21:12.717
It's such a good cause, you guys.

21:12.881 --> 21:14.997
We couldn't do any of it
without your support...

21:15.161 --> 21:18.198
...and the support of Fashion Island
and all their great stores.

21:18.361 --> 21:20.921
All right, enjoy the show.

21:34.201 --> 21:36.669
She's got Tahiti written all over her.

21:42.521 --> 21:45.797
Has anybody seen
my Betsey Johnson dress?

21:47.801 --> 21:52.113
All right. Oh, no.
Much too much makeup. Let's go.

21:52.281 --> 21:54.875
What are you doing
putting my daughter in Calvin Klein?

21:55.041 --> 21:56.599
She was supposed to wear
Vera Wang.

21:56.761 --> 22:00.754
She would if she had the chest to hold
it up. It's called puberty. It'll happen.

22:00.921 --> 22:02.798
Okay, girls, chop-chop, showtime.

22:09.561 --> 22:11.358
Marissa, you're next.

22:16.561 --> 22:18.358
Look what I stole!

22:18.521 --> 22:20.273
Look what I stole!

22:20.441 --> 22:23.831
- All right! Here.
- Thanks.

22:50.601 --> 22:52.831
She's so beautiful, you guys.

22:53.001 --> 22:55.720
You spent more on that dress
than I make in a year.

22:55.881 --> 22:59.999
That's why we trust him with our money.
I expect to die a very rich man.

23:00.161 --> 23:02.550
You're bound to be half-right.

23:04.281 --> 23:05.600
You okay, Jimmy?

23:05.761 --> 23:10.198
Yeah. It's just...
It's a little stuffy in here.

23:10.361 --> 23:13.080
Honey, I'm gonna get
some fresh air, okay?

23:13.241 --> 23:15.596
Marissa wanted to wear
these Prada Mary Janes...

23:15.761 --> 23:18.639
...but I told her she had to wear
the stiletto Manolos.

24:02.001 --> 24:03.912
Hey, where are you going?

24:05.361 --> 24:09.434
My friend Holly... Well, her parents are
letting us use their beach house...

24:09.601 --> 24:12.559
...as a gift because of all our hard work
for charity.

24:13.321 --> 24:15.915
If you need a ride...

24:16.081 --> 24:18.754
...or anything...

24:18.921 --> 24:20.752
...I'm Summer.

24:29.561 --> 24:30.994
- Hey, you ready to go?
- Yeah.

24:31.161 --> 24:33.880
We should go to that party
at that girl Holly's place.

24:34.041 --> 24:36.760
- No, that's not really for us.
- Summer invited me.

24:37.361 --> 24:39.477
Really? She did?

24:40.481 --> 24:43.632
Us. She...
She asked for you, actually.

24:44.361 --> 24:46.511
Really? She did?

24:48.601 --> 24:50.193
Come on!

24:52.401 --> 24:55.711
That makes absolutely no sense,
but, yes, we should go.

24:55.881 --> 24:57.872
We're gonna go with them.
Thanks, guys.

25:10.241 --> 25:12.630
If it sucks, we can always bail.

25:45.441 --> 25:47.591
Welcome to the dark side.

25:50.321 --> 25:53.199
Oh, hey, cocaine. That's awesome.

25:58.681 --> 26:01.479
- Is that a new purse?
- Yeah.

26:01.641 --> 26:03.950
- So cute.
- Does your dad ever say no?

26:08.281 --> 26:11.318
Hey. Look who I brought.

26:14.001 --> 26:16.071
He's cute.

26:17.681 --> 26:20.434
I'm gonna play him hot and cold.

26:23.641 --> 26:25.552
You wanna pee? I've gotta pee.

26:35.521 --> 26:39.594
Isn't it, like, so beautiful?
The sand and the water.

26:39.761 --> 26:42.753
Yeah. Hey, you want to go check it out?

26:43.601 --> 26:45.557
But what about Marissa?

26:45.721 --> 26:47.871
Oh, no worries.

27:11.441 --> 27:13.557
- Hey, Jimmy.
- Hey.

27:13.721 --> 27:15.359
Hey, Dustin.

27:15.521 --> 27:17.432
Dustin, look who's here.

27:20.241 --> 27:24.200
- Are you really okay?
- Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

27:24.361 --> 27:27.956
- Because you can always...
- I've just been working really hard.

27:28.561 --> 27:31.280
So who was that kid
that you brought tonight?

27:31.441 --> 27:34.035
You have a cousin from Boston?

27:34.841 --> 27:38.993
One of Sandy's clients.
He brought him home for the weekend.

27:41.681 --> 27:44.912
Jimmy? Honey, did you get my fro-yo?

27:45.681 --> 27:47.637
No. I forgot.

27:49.281 --> 27:51.317
All right, I'll go back.

27:51.761 --> 27:54.275
Pistachio. Thanks, sweetie. Hi, Kirsten.

28:02.201 --> 28:03.839
Fro-yo.

28:04.881 --> 28:07.634
Did you ever think
this would be our lives?

28:08.441 --> 28:11.831
- Is Marissa back yet?
- Well, she usually stays out pretty late.

28:12.121 --> 28:14.237
Well, Seth never goes out.

28:14.761 --> 28:16.274
Don't worry.

28:17.041 --> 28:19.760
I'm sure they're not
doing anything we didn't do.

28:21.361 --> 28:22.874
That's comforting.

28:31.081 --> 28:33.914
I'm sorry. I should really learn to knock...

28:34.521 --> 28:37.399
...in case there's a threesome
going on in the bathroom.

28:46.841 --> 28:50.197
Fresh keg! Everybody get naked!

28:57.801 --> 28:59.314
Hey.

29:00.361 --> 29:03.000
- Hey.
- So, what do you think of Newport?

29:05.241 --> 29:08.438
I think I can get in less trouble
where I'm from.

29:11.641 --> 29:14.678
Hey, Coop, it's your turn to deal.

29:17.801 --> 29:19.951
You have no idea.

29:23.481 --> 29:26.791
I fixed the keg. Fine, more for me.

29:38.001 --> 29:41.118
Look who I found.

29:43.641 --> 29:45.552
I'm wasted.

29:45.761 --> 29:48.639
- So, what's your name anyway?
- Ryan.

29:48.801 --> 29:51.190
Ryan.

29:54.401 --> 29:57.234
- What are you doing?
- Excuse me.

29:58.401 --> 30:00.676
What are you doing?
I named my boat after her.

30:00.841 --> 30:03.639
What? Who are you?

30:03.801 --> 30:05.678
It's not what you think.
She's drunk.

30:05.841 --> 30:07.479
Come on.

30:09.761 --> 30:12.355
- Seth, Seth.
- Don't touch me!

30:12.521 --> 30:14.716
You know what,
why don't you just go back to Chino?

30:14.881 --> 30:18.351
I'm sure there's a really nice car
in the parking lot that you could steal.

30:23.281 --> 30:25.078
Chino?

30:53.041 --> 30:55.396
- Go home, geek.
- Who invited you, suck-ass?

31:00.841 --> 31:04.356
You guys really wouldn't hurt me,
because that would be so clich Ád.

31:04.521 --> 31:06.751
- I guess you're fans of the clich Á.
- Shut up.

31:06.921 --> 31:10.277
Hey, put him down! Put him down.

31:10.441 --> 31:13.080
Hey, Ryan. What's up?

31:13.401 --> 31:14.595
Put him down.

31:14.761 --> 31:17.355
Hey, what's up, dude?
You got a problem?

31:19.921 --> 31:21.718
You tell me.

31:45.761 --> 31:48.150
Welcome to the O.C., bitch.

31:48.321 --> 31:50.915
This is how it's done in Orange County.

32:20.401 --> 32:21.675
Well...

32:22.681 --> 32:24.876
...I don't know what to say...

32:25.841 --> 32:29.720
...except that you totally
had my back out there.

32:31.281 --> 32:34.000
You were, like, out of <i>Fight Club</i>
or something. I don't know.

32:34.161 --> 32:36.072
You know what I think?

32:36.241 --> 32:39.153
Ryan, I think that if you were
to teach me some moves...

32:39.321 --> 32:42.438
...I think that we could
totally take them next time.

32:42.601 --> 32:46.071
A little bit of that, you know what
I mean? And a little bit of that, that.

32:46.241 --> 32:49.551
What do you think about that? Yeah.

32:49.721 --> 32:55.318
Oh, also, that wasn't exactly the way
that I first planned to talk to Summer...

32:55.481 --> 32:58.041
...but I'm now on her radar.

32:58.201 --> 33:01.591
Do you think I should tell her
about Tahiti? Do you?

33:02.001 --> 33:03.912
- Not yet.
- That's what I thought.

33:04.081 --> 33:08.199
That's what I was thinking. I wanted
to make sure we were on the same page.

33:09.281 --> 33:11.749
What a little night we had there.

33:13.201 --> 33:16.352
I'm not gonna forget it.
Ryan, I'm not gonna forget that one.

33:46.121 --> 33:49.670
- I can't believe her!
- She's so retarded sometimes.

33:49.841 --> 33:53.356
Shouldn't her boyfriend be doing this?
He's so worthless.

33:59.241 --> 34:04.031
Coop! Where are your keys?
How are we gonna find her keys?

34:06.321 --> 34:07.879
I can't find her keys.

34:08.241 --> 34:10.311
We can't wake her parents.
Her dad will go ballistic.

34:10.481 --> 34:12.119
I know.

34:13.321 --> 34:15.072
Bye, Coop.

34:16.721 --> 34:18.552
Call us.

34:36.241 --> 34:37.799
Hey.

34:39.360 --> 34:41.272
Get your keys.

36:00.121 --> 36:01.474
Thank God.

36:06.321 --> 36:09.597
- What happened to your face?
- I got into a fight.

36:09.761 --> 36:14.312
- With who? Why?
- I don't really know. I don't remember.

36:14.481 --> 36:17.712
I was really drunk.
I think I still am a little bit.

36:17.881 --> 36:20.793
Let's go. House. Now.

36:28.721 --> 36:32.077
You should have seen the waves coming
in. Six foot, and it was going off.

36:32.241 --> 36:34.516
- Seth got into a fight.
- He did?

36:34.681 --> 36:38.515
This is what happens when you let
our son hang out with criminals.

36:38.681 --> 36:42.310
At least he has someone to hang out
with. Don't salt his game, honey.

36:43.401 --> 36:47.519
- What the hell does that mean?
- It... I don't know.

36:47.681 --> 36:50.149
I just know I'd rather have Seth
hanging out with Ryan...

36:50.321 --> 36:51.595
...than some trust-fund kid...

36:51.761 --> 36:54.150
...who only cares about getting
a new Beemer every year.

36:54.321 --> 36:57.472
There's a whole world outside
this Newport Beach bubble.

36:57.641 --> 36:59.597
You don't seem to mind
living in this bubble.

36:59.761 --> 37:02.992
I know there's something else
out there.

37:03.161 --> 37:04.958
Remember when we were 22?
What'd you say?

37:05.121 --> 37:08.079
That you'd never be like your parents,
you'd never have their life.

37:08.241 --> 37:12.200
I was 22. I stank of patchouli
and lived in the back of a mail truck.

37:12.361 --> 37:14.397
And you were fun.

37:14.561 --> 37:16.791
And rebellious and...

37:18.001 --> 37:19.992
You married me.

37:22.761 --> 37:25.719
I can't. I'm sorry.

37:28.121 --> 37:31.079
I don't want this kid
in my house anymore.

37:32.961 --> 37:35.270
Where's he supposed to go?

37:35.441 --> 37:37.909
He has a family, Sandy.

37:38.081 --> 37:41.596
It's not up to you to decide
whether or not they're good enough.

37:51.201 --> 37:54.876
Look, Ryan, I don't mean to play bad cop.
It's nothing personal.

37:56.201 --> 37:57.953
Is that bacon?

38:00.201 --> 38:02.715
I usually make breakfast at my house.

38:03.481 --> 38:06.075
My mom's not much of a cook, so...

38:06.681 --> 38:10.310
- I'm sorry. You seem like a really nice kid.
- It's okay.

38:11.561 --> 38:13.199
I get it.

38:20.161 --> 38:22.311
You have a really nice family.

38:48.401 --> 38:50.073
Hey, man.

38:52.881 --> 38:56.669
- Hey.
- Hi. So I gotta jet.

38:58.081 --> 38:59.912
You're leaving?

39:01.521 --> 39:03.034
So...

39:05.761 --> 39:07.114
So, what's up?

39:07.761 --> 39:11.515
I gotta go back, try to figure
some stuff out back home.

39:11.681 --> 39:13.194
Okay, well...

39:14.201 --> 39:15.759
Cool.

39:17.201 --> 39:20.955
Not cool, but,
you know what I think I mean.

39:23.041 --> 39:24.872
Come here.

39:28.961 --> 39:33.512
I'll come down to Chino. I'll visit you,
and you can show me your world...

39:33.681 --> 39:35.717
...or, you know, "'hood" or...

39:36.641 --> 39:38.632
All right.

39:38.801 --> 39:41.713
Wait a second. Just wait one second.

39:48.881 --> 39:50.997
Maybe there's someplace
you'll want to go.

39:53.361 --> 39:55.272
It's pretty good for ideas.

40:02.961 --> 40:04.394
Okay.

41:11.281 --> 41:13.636
So thanks...

41:13.801 --> 41:15.200
...for everything.

41:15.361 --> 41:18.797
I'm gonna make sure
everything works out, Ryan.

41:22.361 --> 41:25.114
It's okay. I can take it from here.

42:26.041 --> 42:28.475
Come on. Let's go.
