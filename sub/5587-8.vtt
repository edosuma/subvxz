00:00.067 --> 00:01.200
ADULT ADAM:
<i> Back in the '80s,</i>

00:01.202 --> 00:03.002
<i> my mom was obsessed</i>
<i> with Thanksgiving.</i>

00:03.004 --> 00:05.904
<i> When it came to her cooking,</i>
<i> everything had to be perfect.</i>

00:05.906 --> 00:08.707
<i> She even made practice turkeys</i>
<i> before the big day.</i>

00:08.709 --> 00:10.709
Mmm!
I need feedback.

00:10.711 --> 00:11.677
That's good!

00:11.679 --> 00:13.278
But not great.
What?

00:13.280 --> 00:14.013
I'm going again.

00:14.015 --> 00:16.682
ADULT ADAM: <i> To my mom,</i>
<i> it was a time for family.</i>

00:16.684 --> 00:17.783
<i> For my dad, it was a hassle.</i>

00:17.785 --> 00:20.886
Why do we got to schlep
all the way here
to go shopping

00:20.888 --> 00:22.654
when we got
a perfectly good market

00:22.656 --> 00:23.989
a minute away
from our house?

00:23.991 --> 00:25.758
Well, I thought
this time of year,

00:25.760 --> 00:26.558
a change
of scenery would...

00:26.560 --> 00:29.094
Oh, look! Murray,
there's your father!

00:29.096 --> 00:30.829
What are the odds
we'd run into him

00:30.831 --> 00:33.098
in a totally random
grocery store?

00:33.100 --> 00:35.934
You got a bag boy
to tip you off, didn't you?

00:35.936 --> 00:37.169
So, I have eyes
everywhere.

00:37.171 --> 00:38.937
What? Does that make me
some kind of villain?

00:38.939 --> 00:40.873
Bevy, every year
you ask me to invite

00:40.875 --> 00:44.576
that spiteful, miserable man
to Thanksgiving.

00:44.578 --> 00:45.911
You got to give it up.

00:45.913 --> 00:46.545
You're right.

00:46.547 --> 00:48.614
He's your father,
and I have no right to...

00:48.616 --> 00:51.483
Hi! Ben, look!
It's your son, Murray!

00:51.485 --> 00:53.986
You remember Murray.

00:53.988 --> 00:55.187
Hi, Dad.
How you doing?

00:55.189 --> 00:58.824
My foot's still
got that thing.
And I need eye surgery.

00:58.826 --> 00:59.992
Yeah, good stuff.

00:59.994 --> 01:02.428
So, any plans
for the holiday, Ben?

01:02.430 --> 01:03.395
BEN: Yeah,
I got it right here.

01:03.397 --> 01:06.498
This compartment
is the stuffing.
That's the sweet potatoes.

01:06.500 --> 01:07.566
That gray circle,
that's the turkey.

01:07.568 --> 01:10.202
Come on,
wouldn't a home-cooked meal
be much better than that?

01:10.204 --> 01:12.671
That depends. You know
what happened the last time
I ate your cooking.

01:12.673 --> 01:17.042
That was right after
we got married.
That was ages ago.

01:17.044 --> 01:18.110
Your turkey was drier
than the sun.

01:18.112 --> 01:22.915
It was like eating
the inside of a vacuum bag
filled with pencil shavings.

01:22.917 --> 01:25.117
I did not enjoy
the meal.

01:25.119 --> 01:25.851
You? No.

01:25.853 --> 01:28.220
It was the first time
I'd ever cooked
Thanksgiving by myself.

01:28.222 --> 01:31.090
My kids were little.
They were hanging
all over me.

01:31.092 --> 01:34.860
I didn't even
have a baster.
I was baster-less!

01:34.862 --> 01:37.763
No baster could fix
your food crimes.

01:37.765 --> 01:40.866
Sorry, pal.
You deserve better.

01:40.868 --> 01:44.203
Nice seeing you, Dad.
BEN: Eh, it was okay.

01:44.271 --> 01:45.037
BEVERLY: This is not over.

01:45.039 --> 01:48.440
You invite that callous,
hurtful man to
Thanksgiving right now!

01:48.442 --> 01:51.944
See, I see why
you're hocking me
all the time to invite him.

01:51.946 --> 01:55.314
You just want
to show my dad
that you're a good cook.

01:55.316 --> 01:57.282
The best cook.

01:57.284 --> 01:59.318
And family is important
and stuff.

01:59.320 --> 02:00.252
Well,
it's not gonna happen.

02:00.254 --> 02:03.856
It's bad enough
you invite my moron
brother every year.

02:03.858 --> 02:05.924
Oh, stop.
Marvin's not that bad.

02:05.926 --> 02:08.560
Gobble, gobble!
Hide your turkeys, ladies!

02:08.562 --> 02:11.396
(BOTH LAUGH)
You little muskrat!

02:11.398 --> 02:12.798
(BLOWING)
Oh!

02:12.800 --> 02:14.399
Looking good,
Uncle Marvin.

02:14.401 --> 02:15.868
I'm feeling good.
I lost 10 pounds.

02:15.870 --> 02:18.303
I gained six,
lost four, gained two.

02:18.305 --> 02:19.438
Also,
your voice is weird.

02:19.440 --> 02:22.141
It is. I, I'm hoping
this isn't where it lands.

02:22.143 --> 02:24.676
(CHUCKLES)
That's the spirit.

02:24.678 --> 02:26.912
(IN DEEP VOICE)
Mur-man!

02:26.914 --> 02:28.914
Ah! Hey!

02:28.916 --> 02:30.349
What's with the, uh,
pajamas?

02:30.351 --> 02:32.885
You mean
these certified
medical scrubs?

02:32.887 --> 02:35.554
As you know,
I'm almost a fully
licensed chiropractor.

02:35.556 --> 02:38.624
Ah. Good.
Another one of your
half-baked schemes.

02:38.626 --> 02:39.458
Schemes?
What schemes?

02:39.460 --> 02:41.927
First, you were
breeding alpacas.

02:41.929 --> 02:44.630
Then you were selling
alpaca wool.

02:44.632 --> 02:45.998
Then came
alpaca burgers.

02:46.000 --> 02:49.168
What the hell
was I supposed to do
with a dozen dead alpacas?

02:49.170 --> 02:49.735
Regardless...

02:49.737 --> 02:53.005
Those were
all obvious steps
to chiropractology.

02:53.007 --> 02:54.773
I don't know
if that's the official title.

02:54.775 --> 02:56.441
They reveal that to us
at graduation.

02:56.443 --> 02:57.876
That's something
to look forward to.

02:57.878 --> 02:59.244
You see that?
Negativity.

02:59.246 --> 03:00.612
I could take away
all of your stress

03:00.614 --> 03:04.449
just with a single
(IMITATES CRACKING)
crack of your cervical spine.

03:04.451 --> 03:05.117
(SCOFFS) No.

03:05.119 --> 03:06.919
Come on. Come on!
Come on!
Aah! No!

03:06.921 --> 03:08.353
I'm serious.
Stay away from me.

03:08.355 --> 03:09.621
Hey, come over here.
Come on.
No, no, no, no.

03:09.623 --> 03:12.090
Don't struggle. I don't want
to break anything.
Come on. No. no!

03:12.092 --> 03:12.824
(GRUNTS)
Get off me!

03:12.826 --> 03:14.893
This feels dangerous
and unsafe!

03:14.895 --> 03:15.594
It is if you fight it!

03:15.596 --> 03:17.863
Oh, I hate Thanksgiving!
I hate it so much!

03:17.865 --> 03:20.866
I'm a healer!
Let me heal you!
Make it stop!

03:20.868 --> 03:22.134
<i> ¶ I'm twisted up inside</i>

03:22.136 --> 03:26.271
<i> ¶ But nonetheless</i>
<i> I feel the need to say</i>

03:28.742 --> 03:29.541
<i> ¶ I don't know the future</i>

03:29.543 --> 03:33.278
<i> ¶ But the past keeps getting</i>
<i> clearer every day ¶</i>

03:33.280 --> 03:35.280
ADULT ADAM: <i> It was</i>
<i> November 20th,</i>
<i> 1980-something,</i>

03:35.282 --> 03:38.450
<i> and Pops was ready</i>
<i> to pass down</i>
<i> a Thanksgiving tradition.</i>

03:38.452 --> 03:41.987
Erica, guess what.
I got something for you.

03:41.989 --> 03:42.754
A car?

03:42.756 --> 03:44.423
No.
Did you get me a car?

03:44.425 --> 03:46.091
No.
Did anyone get a car?

03:46.093 --> 03:48.560
No. What is it
with you kids
and wanting a car?

03:48.562 --> 03:51.730
It's kind of like,
we don't have a car,

03:51.732 --> 03:52.998
but we want one.

03:53.000 --> 03:53.565
Like a car.

03:53.567 --> 03:55.467
Look,
this is even better.

03:55.469 --> 03:58.537
I want you to take over
the Thanksgiving toast.

03:58.539 --> 04:01.006
My grandfather
passed it down to me,

04:01.008 --> 04:01.974
and now I pick you.

04:01.976 --> 04:04.243
Ha! You have to keep
a lame-ass

04:04.245 --> 04:05.410
family tradition alive.

04:05.412 --> 04:07.512
You see, that's why
I'm picking your sister

04:07.514 --> 04:10.282
'cause she's the heart
and soul of this family,

04:10.284 --> 04:12.818
who'll keep
this tradition alive.

04:12.820 --> 04:13.785
Lies!

04:13.787 --> 04:14.553
I'm the heart, soul,

04:14.555 --> 04:17.022
and deadly fists
of this family, not her!

04:17.024 --> 04:17.623
I want to do it!

04:17.625 --> 04:20.392
You're right, kiddo.
If you really want to be
toastmaster general,

04:20.394 --> 04:22.394
then you deserve
a fair shot.

04:22.396 --> 04:23.795
You're so dead.

04:23.797 --> 04:26.598
Saying words good
is my specialness.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.267
To life!

04:28.269 --> 04:30.002
You're clearly
picking me.

04:30.004 --> 04:31.570
I'm picking you.

04:31.572 --> 04:33.105
To life.

04:33.173 --> 04:34.473
Dad, I, I know
you're swamped

04:34.475 --> 04:37.075
watching your big
football contest.

04:37.077 --> 04:37.843
Go, blue team.

04:37.845 --> 04:39.711
I actually like
the green team.

04:39.713 --> 04:41.113
Fun stuff. Listen,

04:41.115 --> 04:42.581
I don't want
to waste your time,

04:42.583 --> 04:43.582
but I thought
you should know

04:43.584 --> 04:47.519
that I might be working on
my best video project yet.

04:48.455 --> 04:49.087
What's happening?

04:49.089 --> 04:51.023
I just need six more hours
of therapeutic massage

04:51.025 --> 04:54.059
under my belt before
I'm board-certified.

04:54.061 --> 04:55.527
This isn't a good time.

04:55.529 --> 04:57.562
Gotcha.
(POPPING LIPS)

04:57.564 --> 04:59.598
Anyway, now
that I'm getting older

04:59.600 --> 05:00.866
and growing
as an artist,

05:00.868 --> 05:03.568
I'm venturing away
from robot movies

05:03.570 --> 05:07.806
and fart-based comedy skits
to more serious work,

05:07.808 --> 05:09.841
with real emotional
impact.

05:09.843 --> 05:11.510
This still
isn't a good time.

05:11.512 --> 05:13.745
The moment
felt right.
It's not.

05:13.747 --> 05:14.446
Roger that.

05:14.448 --> 05:15.981
<i> ¶ Beep, bap,</i>
<i> bee-bap, boop ¶</i>

05:15.983 --> 05:18.216
Point is, I need
a better wide-angle lens

05:18.218 --> 05:20.752
to fully realize my vision,
but they're quite pricy.

05:20.754 --> 05:25.324
My vision is
I won't have any children
asking me for money.

05:26.060 --> 05:26.692
Go away!

05:26.694 --> 05:28.160
Okay, okay, but this
counts as an hour.

05:28.162 --> 05:29.961
I'm gonna go get
the paperwork
for you to sign.

05:29.963 --> 05:33.665
Look, all I want you
to do is watch
what I have already.

05:33.667 --> 05:34.633
I think you'll see
what I mean.

05:34.635 --> 05:37.736
ADULT ADAM: <i> That year,</i>
<i> I discovered the song</i>
Cat's In The Cradle.

05:37.738 --> 05:39.571
<i> Like any teenage kid,</i>
<i> the catchy chorus</i>

05:39.573 --> 05:42.841
<i> and "My dad is a jerk" lyrics</i>
<i> spoke to me.</i>

05:42.843 --> 05:46.244
<i> ¶ And the cat's in the cradle</i>
<i> and the silver spoon</i>

05:46.246 --> 05:48.714
<i> ¶ Little boy blue</i>
<i> and the man in the moon</i>

05:48.716 --> 05:52.851
ADULT ADAM:
<i> What I didn't realize,</i>
<i> it spoke to my dad even more.</i>

05:52.853 --> 05:55.420
<i> ¶ But we'll get together, then</i>

05:55.422 --> 05:58.490
<i> ¶ You know we'll have</i>
<i> a good time then ¶</i>

05:58.492 --> 06:01.827
Oh. That song.
(REMOTE CLICKS)

06:01.829 --> 06:04.763
Always manages to hit
you hard, you know?

06:04.765 --> 06:07.432
I guess.
It's only halfway done.

06:10.037 --> 06:11.870
You finish it.

06:12.773 --> 06:13.572
Wait. For real?

06:13.574 --> 06:14.539
Yeah.
Before I change my mind.

06:14.541 --> 06:17.409
ADULT ADAM:
<i> Turns out</i> Cat's In The Cradle
<i> made my dad feel things,</i>

06:17.411 --> 06:20.278
<i> and like any good son,</i>
<i> I'd use this</i>
<i> to manipulate him.</i>

06:20.280 --> 06:24.583
Hey, Dad, they just
released a new
<i> Dungeons & Dragons</i> module.

06:24.585 --> 06:25.751
Can you drive me
to the hobby shop tonight?

06:25.753 --> 06:29.054
I understand none of that,
but I feel good saying no.
I'm off to work.

06:29.056 --> 06:32.190
Okay, but when you
coming home, dad?
I don't know when.

06:32.192 --> 06:36.294
ADULT ADAM: <i> All I did</i>
<i> was subliminally</i>
<i> remind him of the song.</i>

06:36.296 --> 06:38.263
We'll get together then.

06:38.265 --> 06:39.765
Damn.

06:39.767 --> 06:40.499
Let's just go now.

06:40.501 --> 06:42.534
ADULT ADAM: <i> As I was</i>
<i> working over my old man,</i>

06:42.536 --> 06:45.170
<i> Barry was working out</i>
<i> a new toast.</i>

06:45.172 --> 06:46.204
"F" is for family.

06:46.206 --> 06:48.673
"A" is for how awesome
this family is.

06:48.675 --> 06:49.908
"M" is for "Mmm, turkey."

06:49.910 --> 06:51.610
"I" is for my eyes
that get to see you all.

06:51.612 --> 06:56.948
"L" is for LL Cool J
who probably
also celebrates Thanksgiving.

06:56.950 --> 06:57.682
"Y"?

06:57.684 --> 07:00.485
Because he's American,
like us.

07:00.487 --> 07:01.153
Family!

07:01.155 --> 07:04.523
(CLEARS THROAT)
I mean, you got charm.

07:04.525 --> 07:06.358
Uh, but what you don't have
is a good speech,

07:06.360 --> 07:08.427
or charm. I just said that
to cushion the blow.

07:08.429 --> 07:10.695
Damn it.
What am I supposed to do?

07:10.697 --> 07:12.597
Erica's so smart
and emotional

07:12.599 --> 07:15.867
and has these female hormones
that make her feel stuff.

07:15.869 --> 07:16.768
How do I compete
with that?

07:16.770 --> 07:19.070
Well... (CLEARS THROAT)
The first thing you got to do

07:19.072 --> 07:20.305
is lie down
and let your Uncle Marvin

07:20.307 --> 07:24.109
crackle your spine bones
and your neck tendons
to release toxins.

07:24.111 --> 07:25.510
Okay.
Okay?

07:25.512 --> 07:27.512
Okay!
Okay!

07:27.915 --> 07:31.183
Right there?
Yeah. Facedown.
There you go.

07:31.185 --> 07:33.418
Got to get
a good stretch on here.

07:33.420 --> 07:35.053
This flank.

07:35.055 --> 07:35.921
Hey!

07:35.923 --> 07:36.922
Aah! Oh!

07:36.924 --> 07:38.490
That...
That hurts my body.

07:38.492 --> 07:39.758
That means it's working.

07:39.760 --> 07:40.425
As for your speech,

07:40.427 --> 07:42.093
there's one thing
that I learned
in back-cracking school,

07:42.095 --> 07:43.161
and that's how
to captivate a client.

07:43.163 --> 07:44.663
Go on.
You see, in the manual,
it says

07:44.665 --> 07:47.699
that constant talk
and distraction
helps them ignore

07:47.701 --> 07:51.069
the searing pain
that is spinal alignment.

07:51.071 --> 07:51.903
That makes sense.

07:51.905 --> 07:54.606
It's not just about
using your words.

07:54.608 --> 07:56.708
It's also
about flash!

07:56.710 --> 07:58.710
(BONES CRACK)
Ah!

07:58.712 --> 08:00.846
Flash! You're right.

08:00.848 --> 08:03.014
That's what I need
to add to my toast!

08:03.016 --> 08:03.615
Exactly.

08:03.617 --> 08:07.652
Now, just get up there
and show them
what you got, kid.

08:08.956 --> 08:10.922
BARRY: I'm good.

08:12.559 --> 08:13.425
You look good.

08:13.427 --> 08:17.095
ALF: (ON TV) <i> Get away</i>
<i> with murder, so to speak.</i>

08:17.097 --> 08:19.631
<i> Right now,</i>
<i> I could walk over...</i>

08:19.633 --> 08:20.966
Well, what's going
on in here?

08:20.968 --> 08:23.902
Just watching <i> ALF</i>
and playing
cat's cradle.

08:23.904 --> 08:25.136
No relation to the song.

08:25.138 --> 08:26.872
You know the song,
right, Dad?

08:26.874 --> 08:27.506
(HUFFS) That song.

08:27.508 --> 08:31.176
You know what would
push this father/son
moment over the top?

08:31.178 --> 08:33.211
You whip us up a malt
to share.

08:33.213 --> 08:35.981
That's a great idea,
pal.

08:37.184 --> 08:38.216
What's going on?

08:38.218 --> 08:40.252
Just some father/son
bonding time.

08:40.254 --> 08:41.520
Tell me
what you've done to him,

08:41.522 --> 08:43.355
or I'll make you go outside
and play catch with your dad

08:43.357 --> 08:45.423
on the lawn
in front of the
entire neighborhood.

08:45.425 --> 08:48.693
No.
And not with one of those
soft nerf balls, either.

08:48.695 --> 08:50.729
Not the hard, white ones
with the sewing on them.

08:50.731 --> 08:53.398
That's right.
Baseballs.

08:53.400 --> 08:53.999
Okay, okay!

08:54.001 --> 08:56.835
Truth is, <i> Cat's in the Cradle</i>
makes dad bend to my will

08:56.837 --> 08:58.970
'cause the words
make him sad.

08:58.972 --> 09:00.906
How selfish can you be?

09:00.908 --> 09:02.140
I'm sorry. I'll stop.

09:02.142 --> 09:04.476
You most certainly will.

09:04.945 --> 09:07.178
After you use your evil
to help me.

09:07.180 --> 09:08.113
Seriously?
Play the song.

09:08.115 --> 09:10.048
Get him to invite Pop Pop
to Thanksgiving

09:10.050 --> 09:12.150
so he can finally see
what an amazing cook I am.

09:12.152 --> 09:15.987
Isn't your thing, like,
way more selfish than mine?

09:15.989 --> 09:17.322
Oh, yes.
(CHUCKLES)

09:17.324 --> 09:20.792
Now that man will eat
my food and his words.

09:20.794 --> 09:21.293
(CHUCKLES)

09:21.295 --> 09:23.628
And also,
family's important
and stuff.

09:23.630 --> 09:26.631
There's a lesson
in there. Figure it out.

09:27.568 --> 09:29.067
Gobble, gobble.

09:31.838 --> 09:33.004
ADULT ADAM:
<i> It was almost dinnertime,</i>

09:33.006 --> 09:36.474
<i> and even though I manipulated</i>
<i> Dad into inviting Pop Pop,</i>

09:36.476 --> 09:37.976
<i> the old grouch was a no-show.</i>

09:37.978 --> 09:40.812
Do we have to wait
for Pop Pop?
I'm starving.

09:40.814 --> 09:42.314
Just give me
a scoop.

09:42.316 --> 09:44.816
Hey! Don't ruin
the presentation.

09:44.818 --> 09:47.319
Half of eating
is done with the eyes.

09:47.321 --> 09:48.587
Murray,
where's your father?

09:48.589 --> 09:50.088
He'll be here
any minute.

09:50.090 --> 09:53.358
Still waiting on Dad, eh?
(LAUGHS)

09:53.360 --> 09:54.526
That's weird.

09:54.528 --> 09:56.995
I thought you
called him, Murray.

09:56.997 --> 09:57.896
(LAUGHS MANIACALLY)

09:57.898 --> 09:59.965
Okay, you're really
laughing it up,

09:59.967 --> 10:02.133
which tells me
you've done
something idiotic

10:02.135 --> 10:04.369
and you want me
to hear about it.
Go ahead.

10:04.371 --> 10:05.570
After you called
our father

10:05.572 --> 10:08.673
to invite him
to Thanksgiving,
I called him back,

10:08.675 --> 10:10.942
and I said that I was
going to pick him up.

10:10.944 --> 10:12.143
(LAUGHING)
But I never did.

10:12.145 --> 10:16.348
You know,
even for you,
this is incredibly stupid.

10:16.350 --> 10:16.948
Uh, it's brilliant,

10:16.950 --> 10:18.717
and you have
your son Adam
to thank for it,

10:18.719 --> 10:22.120
'cause he keeps
on playing that
<i> Cat's in the Cradle</i> song.

10:22.122 --> 10:23.121
(CHUCKLING)
And, uh, everyone knows

10:23.123 --> 10:25.056
that it's the greatest
revenge song ever written.

10:25.058 --> 10:27.459
How do you get revenge
from that song?

10:27.461 --> 10:27.959
Hello?

10:27.961 --> 10:30.762
It's about a boy
who gets shafted
by his dad,

10:30.764 --> 10:31.396
just like we were.

10:31.398 --> 10:34.633
And then he grows up,
and his dad calls him
to hang out,

10:34.635 --> 10:36.067
and then the boy
is just like,

10:36.069 --> 10:38.570
"Ha! I've been waiting
for this moment.

10:38.572 --> 10:40.438
"I have my own life now.

10:40.440 --> 10:42.207
"So suck it, old man!"
Click!

10:42.209 --> 10:43.408
That's not
what it's about!

10:43.410 --> 10:46.077
It's about spending time
with your kid.

10:46.079 --> 10:47.512
Pfft! What you
talkin' 'bout, Murray?

10:47.514 --> 10:48.980
It's right there
in the lyrics.

10:48.982 --> 10:52.217
<i> ¶ The cat eats the baby</i>
<i> with the silver spoon ¶</i>

10:52.219 --> 10:53.218
Those aren't the words!

10:53.220 --> 10:55.520
It didn't eat a baby.
No baby got eaten.

10:55.522 --> 10:57.922
The cat eats the baby...
No baby gets eaten.

10:57.924 --> 11:00.458
...with the silver spoo...
Would you wake up?

11:00.460 --> 11:03.261
A cat cannot use
a spoon.

11:03.263 --> 11:04.262
It's got paws.

11:04.264 --> 11:06.197
A cat can very easily

11:06.199 --> 11:08.967
just pick up a spoon
like so

11:08.969 --> 11:10.068
and...
(IMITATE SPLASH)

11:10.070 --> 11:12.437
(KEYS JINGLE)
Hey. Whoa! Stop!

11:12.439 --> 11:15.106
Wh... It's dinner time.
Where are you going?

11:15.108 --> 11:15.740
To get my father.

11:15.742 --> 11:17.642
You're gonna ruin
my ruthless revenge
plot against dad!

11:17.644 --> 11:19.978
What kind
of Thanksgiving is this?
Hey...

11:19.980 --> 11:21.546
ADULT ADAM:
<i> What we didn't know...</i>
(DOOR CLOSES)

11:21.548 --> 11:24.282
<i> ...was Thanksgiving</i>
<i> was about to get awesome.</i>

11:24.284 --> 11:26.785
Why don't we just hear
a toast while we're waiting?

11:26.787 --> 11:30.789
Erica, show us
what you got.
Thank you, Pops.

11:31.058 --> 11:31.990
(CLEARS THROAT)

11:31.992 --> 11:34.626
Well, I'm just gonna
speak from the heart
and say...

11:34.628 --> 11:38.630
BARRY: (VOICE AMPLIFIED)
<i> Ladies and</i>
<i> gentlemen-men-men-men,</i>

11:38.632 --> 11:40.265
<i> are you prepared</i>
<i> for the ultimate</i>

11:40.267 --> 11:43.868
<i> Thanksgiving extravaganza</i>
<i> of love-love-love-love?</i>

11:43.870 --> 11:46.604
ADULT ADAM: <i> And with that,</i>
<i> Barry appeared from the smoke</i>

11:46.606 --> 11:48.173
<i> to take Thanksgiving</i>
<i> to a new level.</i>

11:48.175 --> 11:50.208
<i> ¶ Never surrender ¶</i>
What the heck is this?

11:50.210 --> 11:52.077
An idiot giving
a Thanksgiving toast.

11:52.079 --> 11:55.947
Y'all's about to get touched,
ninja pilgrim-style.

11:55.949 --> 11:57.282
Turkey. Yah!

11:57.284 --> 11:58.349
ADULT ADAM:
<i> It was educational.</i>

11:58.351 --> 12:01.686
And so that's when
Chris Colombo
married Pocahontas

12:01.688 --> 12:05.023
and they feasted
upon corn, or maize,

12:05.025 --> 12:08.193
named after its a-maize-ing
taste when buttered.

12:08.195 --> 12:10.395
ADULT ADAM: <i> It had music.</i>

12:10.764 --> 12:13.531
<i> It was packed with metaphors</i>
<i> and symbolism.</i>

12:13.533 --> 12:15.533
(GRUNTING)

12:16.036 --> 12:17.802
<i> It had pyrotechnics.</i>

12:17.804 --> 12:20.371
<i> And breaks for hydration.</i>

12:20.373 --> 12:22.574
<i> It had emotional pandering...</i>

12:22.576 --> 12:24.309
Look at us. Love.

12:24.311 --> 12:25.343
He leaps from half-court!

12:25.345 --> 12:27.746
ADULT ADAM:
<i> ...and a cinematic climax.</i>

12:27.748 --> 12:29.414
Three points for family!

12:29.416 --> 12:30.949
The nuclear weapons
are disarmed!

12:30.951 --> 12:34.018
The Goldbergs
saved the world!

12:34.020 --> 12:35.820
In conclusion,
Thanksgiving!

12:35.822 --> 12:38.590
ADULT ADAM: (LAUGHS)
<i> And it was awesome!</i>

12:38.592 --> 12:42.594
Wait! You actually enjoyed
that confusing pile
of garbage?

12:42.596 --> 12:44.195
It was
a real experience.

12:44.197 --> 12:46.397
I feel like
I just went
to Atlantic City.

12:46.399 --> 12:49.300
I liked the part
where you showed
the baby pictures.

12:49.302 --> 12:50.301
But it made no sense!

12:50.303 --> 12:52.570
How can a slam dunk
disarm nuclear weapons?

12:52.572 --> 12:56.107
Can't wait to hear
what you got
in store, Erica.

12:56.109 --> 12:56.608
Uh...

12:56.610 --> 12:58.777
I think we should
space them out a bit.

12:58.779 --> 13:00.578
No! Please.

13:00.580 --> 13:01.513
Talk from the heart.

13:01.515 --> 13:03.047
Uh... We should wait
on Pop Pop,

13:03.049 --> 13:06.518
because that is
the right thing to do.

13:06.520 --> 13:07.986
So I'll be upstairs.

13:07.988 --> 13:08.686
Not writing a speech.

13:08.688 --> 13:10.955
Just, uh, waiting
for them to show up,
so I'll be gone.

13:10.957 --> 13:14.526
ADULT ADAM:
<i> As Erica retreated,</i>
<i> Pop Pop was on the warpath.</i>

13:14.528 --> 13:15.493
I can't believe
you people...

13:15.495 --> 13:18.997
Making me wait outside
nearly seven minutes
in the dead of fall.

13:18.999 --> 13:22.300
It was just
a little mix-up, Dad.
Marvin will apologize.

13:22.302 --> 13:23.568
You want me
to apologize to him,

13:23.570 --> 13:26.104
the man who picked me
up from soccer practice
at midnight?

13:26.106 --> 13:26.971
I had a thing.
That's it!

13:26.973 --> 13:28.973
I'm not stepping
one foot in that house
as long as he's here!

13:28.975 --> 13:31.810
Good.
Now I got something
to be thankful for.

13:31.812 --> 13:33.211
(EXCLAIMS)

13:33.213 --> 13:36.447
Hey! What are you doing
dropping the pants?
That's my thing.

13:36.449 --> 13:39.918
I'm the one that invented
dropping your slacks
at the door.

13:39.920 --> 13:42.287
It's Thanksgiving.
Pull up your pants.

13:42.289 --> 13:42.987
How you doing, Ben?

13:42.989 --> 13:43.988
You think
you're better than me?

13:43.990 --> 13:47.158
(CHUCKLES)
Speaking of better,
try my turkey, Ben. Taste.

13:47.160 --> 13:49.360
No, no, no.
I learned my lesson
a long time ago.

13:49.362 --> 13:51.095
Here. Heat this up.
I'm starving.

13:51.097 --> 13:54.532
Come on. You can't have
Thanksgiving from a box.

13:54.534 --> 13:55.834
Just take a taste, Ben.

13:55.836 --> 13:56.935
I'm not kidding you.

13:56.937 --> 13:58.002
Take a damn taste.

13:58.004 --> 14:00.371
I'll take a taste!
I'm eating out here!

14:00.373 --> 14:01.739
Everyone,
just calm down.

14:01.741 --> 14:05.844
Adam, uh, why don't you
just play your
<i> Cat's In The Cradle</i> video?

14:05.846 --> 14:08.513
Oh, hey! Son of a bitch.
I love that song.

14:08.515 --> 14:10.348
That's got
that nice message in it.

14:10.350 --> 14:10.949
That right?

14:10.951 --> 14:12.717
Yeah,
there's this needy brat

14:12.719 --> 14:14.953
who's been pestering
his dad for years.

14:14.955 --> 14:16.354
His dad just wants
to be left alone.

14:16.356 --> 14:18.990
All right, so,
now, years later,
they're on the phone,

14:18.992 --> 14:22.660
but his son now...
Oh, he's finally
into his own crap.

14:22.662 --> 14:24.028
So his father
hangs up the phone

14:24.030 --> 14:26.064
because now he's got
what he's always wanted.

14:26.066 --> 14:27.832
To be
left the hell alone.
(DOOR OPENS)

14:27.834 --> 14:29.767
It's a revenge song!

14:29.769 --> 14:31.669
The son wins in the end!

14:31.671 --> 14:32.503
No one wins!

14:32.505 --> 14:35.540
It's about the struggle
to not let time slip away.

14:35.542 --> 14:36.140
No one thinks that!

14:36.142 --> 14:38.743
(DOOR SLAMS)
Adam.
Do your Jedi mind trick.

14:38.745 --> 14:40.078
Play the video
and make people
listen to you.

14:40.080 --> 14:43.381
That's why you've been
playing that damn song
all the time?

14:43.383 --> 14:45.483
Oh, balls.
You were screwing
with my mind?

14:45.485 --> 14:48.553
Mom was the one
that tricked you
into inviting Pop Pop

14:48.555 --> 14:50.221
so she could
force-feed him turkey.

14:50.223 --> 14:51.522
What?
What?

14:51.524 --> 14:52.290
What? I can't hear!

14:52.292 --> 14:54.592
I'm outside here!
Speak louder!
<i> ¶ Never surrender ¶</i>

14:54.594 --> 14:58.663
Who's ready for a high-octane,
tear-jerkin'
Thanksgiving toast?

14:58.665 --> 15:00.465
Oh, boy.
This is real bad timing.

15:00.467 --> 15:03.067
Watch out, Russia.
It's the American
baseball team,

15:03.069 --> 15:05.970
and they're hitting
home runs for family.
(GASPS)

15:05.972 --> 15:07.772
Oh!
My decorative gourds!

15:07.774 --> 15:09.774
Dude! You're stealing
my whole speech!

15:09.776 --> 15:12.911
No, it's different!
You did basketball.
I'm doing baseball.

15:12.913 --> 15:14.879
What?
Doesn't matter. I win.

15:14.881 --> 15:17.148
I forgot what it was for,
but I beat you.

15:17.150 --> 15:19.684
You don't even know
what this is about?

15:19.686 --> 15:21.085
I dislike you so much!

15:21.087 --> 15:24.022
BEVERLY: Stop it! Stop it!
Everybody stop it!
Barry!

15:24.024 --> 15:25.290
Stop it!
It's Thanks (BLEEP) giving!

15:25.292 --> 15:29.327
I don't care what it is!
I want these crazy people
out of my house!

15:29.329 --> 15:30.962
No! I'm so close!

15:30.964 --> 15:32.030
Ben, try my yams.

15:32.032 --> 15:33.197
I learned my lesson.
No.

15:33.199 --> 15:35.466
No yams!
I'm taking out the leaf!

15:35.468 --> 15:36.968
No! Not the leaf!

15:36.970 --> 15:38.102
What's happening?

15:38.104 --> 15:40.605
(GRUNTS) Aah!

15:40.740 --> 15:42.974
I feel so left out!

15:44.744 --> 15:45.843
MURRAY: Ugh, my back.

15:45.845 --> 15:48.112
ADULT ADAM: <i> It was</i>
<i> a Thanksgiving stalemate.</i>

15:48.114 --> 15:49.280
<i> My dad wanted everyone out,</i>

15:49.282 --> 15:51.516
<i> and Marvin was refusing</i>
<i> to come in.</i>

15:51.518 --> 15:53.618
What are you
still doing here?

15:53.620 --> 15:55.119
Thanksgiving's over.
Go home.

15:55.121 --> 15:56.154
No. We can
still save this thing.

15:56.156 --> 15:59.223
Barry, help me set
the table around
your father.

15:59.225 --> 15:59.791
I can't move!

15:59.793 --> 16:03.461
I sold 80-pound vacuums
door to door
with a shattered pelvis.

16:03.463 --> 16:03.928
Suck it up!

16:03.930 --> 16:07.365
Marvin, get inside.
Murray threw his back out,
and we need your magic hands.

16:07.367 --> 16:08.933
Yes, I can see
how you might think,

16:08.935 --> 16:12.370
based on my
consistent claim
that I'm a chiropractor,

16:12.372 --> 16:15.673
how I might be
of some service in this
particular situation.

16:15.675 --> 16:18.242
You can't help?
What kind of
a male nurse are you?

16:18.244 --> 16:19.911
I am a chiropractor,
damn it.

16:19.913 --> 16:22.780
At least, I will be
once the school
is recognized by the state.

16:22.782 --> 16:24.983
There's no way
that man's touching me!

16:24.985 --> 16:27.118
Okay, that's enough.
I have something to say.

16:27.120 --> 16:30.421
Again,
it's very bad timing.

16:30.423 --> 16:32.890
Look, maybe
we're a garbage family,

16:32.892 --> 16:35.593
and maybe
we don't always get along.

16:35.595 --> 16:38.863
But, you know,
maybe that's okay.

16:38.865 --> 16:41.132
Maybe that's
a good thing.

16:41.134 --> 16:44.168
I mean, Barry's one
of the biggest idiots
of all time,

16:44.170 --> 16:47.238
but he gave the best toast
this family's ever seen.

16:47.240 --> 16:48.973
Yes! Ignoring
the first part.

16:48.975 --> 16:52.210
And if this utter dope
can pull that off,

16:52.212 --> 16:53.344
well, then I'm sure
my dopey uncle

16:53.346 --> 16:58.049
has learned enough
at back school
that he can fix my dad.

16:58.752 --> 17:01.719
No! Do not get inspired
by her speech!

17:01.721 --> 17:03.988
'Cause the fact is
it's Thanksgiving!

17:03.990 --> 17:06.991
And if a family
can't believe
in each other

17:06.993 --> 17:09.127
on a day like today...

17:09.295 --> 17:10.028
Well, then, when can we?

17:10.030 --> 17:13.297
ADULT ADAM:
<i> Sure, it was insulting,</i>
<i> but also deeply moving.</i>

17:13.299 --> 17:17.468
<i> That night, Erica proved</i>
<i> that she could toast</i>
<i> with the best of them.</i>

17:17.470 --> 17:18.836
What is happening?

17:18.838 --> 17:20.605
(DOOR BURSTS OPEN)

17:21.174 --> 17:24.342
Your faith in me
is all the training I need.

17:24.411 --> 17:25.376
(SCREAMS) No!

17:25.378 --> 17:26.477
You can do it, Marvy.

17:26.479 --> 17:28.346
No!
It's all you, Uncle Marv.

17:28.348 --> 17:31.549
No!
Give it a shot, Marv!

17:31.551 --> 17:33.017
I'm a little drunk.

17:33.019 --> 17:33.818
I'm going in!

17:33.820 --> 17:35.987
Don't go in!
What are you doing?

17:35.989 --> 17:37.255
(GRUNTS)
Flash!

17:37.257 --> 17:39.023
(BONES CRACK)

17:49.402 --> 17:51.069
How you feel?

17:53.239 --> 17:55.206
I actually feel better.
MARVIN: Yeah?

17:55.208 --> 17:56.908
Look, he's
standing straighter!

17:56.910 --> 17:59.644
I told you I'm a God!
(LAUGHS)

17:59.646 --> 18:01.646
Marvin saved
Thanksgiving!

18:01.648 --> 18:03.748
Marvin. Marvin!

18:03.750 --> 18:04.482
(LAUGHS MANIACALLY)

18:04.484 --> 18:05.983
ADULT ADAM: <i> Even though</i>
<i> Marvin took all the credit,</i>

18:05.985 --> 18:07.985
<i> my mom still got the moment</i>
<i> she always dreamed of.</i>

18:07.987 --> 18:11.656
Damn it, Marvin!
You're... You're hogging
the yams!

18:11.658 --> 18:12.924
Ah, buh, buh, buh!

18:12.926 --> 18:15.827
Look at my old man
loving your food.

18:15.829 --> 18:18.229
Guess you finally got
what you wanted.

18:18.231 --> 18:18.996
Raised a moron.

18:18.998 --> 18:20.898
BEVERLY:
Yeah. It's great.

18:20.900 --> 18:22.433
But look at them
all there.

18:22.435 --> 18:24.769
<i> ¶ He learned to walk</i>
<i> while I was away ¶</i>

18:24.771 --> 18:26.671
Family and stuff.
(CHUCKLES)

18:26.673 --> 18:28.306
Yeah.
Family and stuff.

18:28.308 --> 18:30.541
ADULT ADAM: <i> It turned out</i>
<i> to be our best</i>
<i> Thanksgiving ever.</i>

18:30.543 --> 18:33.511
<i> And even though Barry</i>
<i> and Erica battled</i>
<i> over the best speech,</i>

18:33.513 --> 18:37.515
<i> in the end,</i>
<i> Pops reclaimed the crown.</i>
(SPOON CLINKS)

18:37.650 --> 18:39.617
I'd like to make
a little toast.

18:39.619 --> 18:44.922
Normally, this holiday
makes me think
of the love of my life.

18:44.924 --> 18:46.290
My wife, Irene.

18:46.292 --> 18:49.393
But as I look
around this table tonight,

18:49.395 --> 18:53.598
I realize we shouldn't dwell
on the loves we've lost.

18:53.600 --> 18:58.002
'Cause there's more
than enough love right here.

19:00.773 --> 19:01.339
Cheers.

19:01.341 --> 19:02.406
MURRAY: Hear, hear.
(GLASSES CLINK)

19:02.408 --> 19:05.042
(SNIFFLES)
Thinks he's better
than us, that bastard.

19:05.044 --> 19:07.378
If anyone would like
a spinal adjustment,

19:07.380 --> 19:08.980
meet me on the couch
when this is over.

19:08.982 --> 19:12.016
<i> ¶ I said, "Not today,</i>
<i> I got a lot to do"</i>

19:12.018 --> 19:12.817
<i> ¶ He said, "That's okay"</i>

19:12.819 --> 19:17.321
<i> ¶ And then he walked away,</i>
<i> but his smile never dimmed</i>
<i> and said...</i>

19:17.323 --> 19:17.922
I don't get it.

19:17.924 --> 19:22.193
How on earth can you think
this song's about
being a lousy father?

19:22.195 --> 19:23.794
Just a theory.

19:23.796 --> 19:25.163
Well...

19:25.165 --> 19:28.699
I watch you
with your kids.
You're, um...

19:28.801 --> 19:30.868
Not like me.

19:31.204 --> 19:33.337
You're a good father
to them.

19:33.339 --> 19:35.373
Even to the weird one.

19:37.243 --> 19:39.911
I don't know which one
that is, but thank you.

19:39.913 --> 19:42.547
<i> (CAT'S IN THE CRADLE</i>

19:52.959 --> 19:54.225
Hey. The...
The video over?

19:54.227 --> 19:56.160
(STUTTERS) I got nervous,
so I left.

19:56.162 --> 19:59.063
Yeah. It, uh, played well.

19:59.299 --> 20:03.100
Noticed my name
on the end there.

20:03.102 --> 20:04.602
Since when
am I your producer?

20:04.604 --> 20:06.370
Since you paid
for the lens.

20:06.372 --> 20:08.906
I couldn't have done it
without you.

20:09.108 --> 20:10.675
Any of it.

20:10.677 --> 20:13.511
<i> ¶ Little boy blue</i>
<i> and the man in the moon</i>

20:13.513 --> 20:15.279
So...

20:15.415 --> 20:16.647
Yeah.

20:16.649 --> 20:17.348
Yeah.

20:17.350 --> 20:20.218
<i> ¶ But we'll get</i>
<i> together then, Dad</i>

20:20.220 --> 20:21.852
You okay?

20:22.355 --> 20:24.522
Yeah. I'm good.

20:28.394 --> 20:32.697
<i> ¶ And the cat's in the cradle</i>

20:34.901 --> 20:38.736

<i> ¶ But we'll get</i>

20:49.182 --> 20:52.650
A few guys from the
water polo team
invited me on a ski trip.

20:52.652 --> 20:55.886
No.
Would you just hear me out
before you say no?

20:55.888 --> 20:56.520
I already said no.

20:56.522 --> 20:58.155
Well, I wrote a little song
about father/daughter
relationships

20:58.157 --> 21:02.793
that just may make
you realize that our time
together is fleeting.

21:02.795 --> 21:03.561
(TV TURNS OFF)

21:03.563 --> 21:07.098
<i> ¶ A butterfly emerges</i>
<i> from a cocoon</i>

21:07.867 --> 21:12.536
<i> ¶ A dad and daughter</i>
<i> gaze at the moon</i>

21:12.972 --> 21:14.972
<i> ¶ Fathers and daughters</i>
<i> and fathers of daughters</i>

<i> ¶ And the man in the moon</i>

<i> his daughter... ¶</i>

21:19.279 --> 21:19.810
Wow!

21:19.812 --> 21:23.414
That song made me realize
how precious our time is.

21:23.416 --> 21:24.782
So I can go
on the ski trip?

21:24.784 --> 21:27.551
No. I want you
by my side all weekend.

21:27.553 --> 21:29.920
This really backfired
on me, huh?
