00:37.320 --> 00:38.582
Yo?

00:38.621 --> 00:39.781
Daggum, dude, man,

00:39.823 --> 00:41.183
talkin' big ol' bite
of apple, man,

00:41.191 --> 00:42.158
talkin' life sentence...

00:42.192 --> 00:43.625
daggum buyin' a cow.

00:43.660 --> 00:46.026
Oh, man, you talkin' 'bout 'em
like like a dang ol'...

00:46.062 --> 00:47.222
Dang.

00:47.263 --> 00:49.060
Daggum, big wigjingo
bang it up, dog!

00:49.099 --> 00:50.430
Like... Woo! Yeah, baby!

00:52.368 --> 00:55.599
Wow, so your little brother
Patch is getting married.

00:55.638 --> 00:57.230
Now that calls for a beer.

00:57.273 --> 00:58.433
Yup!
Yup!

00:58.475 --> 00:59.464
Mm-hmm.

01:01.211 --> 01:04.339
Yeah, you boys were always
competing over something.

01:04.379 --> 01:06.575
Who could sell
the most copies of <i>Grit</i>.

01:06.616 --> 01:08.675
Who could bag
the most groceries.

01:08.718 --> 01:10.583
Who could bag the most ladies.

01:10.620 --> 01:14.283
It was always close, but
it was always Boomhauer.

01:14.324 --> 01:17.225
Yeah, but Patch finally beat
Boomhauer at something...

01:17.260 --> 01:19.353
His way to the altar.

01:19.395 --> 01:21.295
Oh, don't worry, Boomhauer,

01:21.331 --> 01:23.231
Patch might have
beat you to the altar,

01:23.266 --> 01:24.858
but you'll beat him
to the grave.

01:24.901 --> 01:26.994
As a bachelor,
your life expectancy

01:27.036 --> 01:30.267
is seven years shorter
than us blissfully marrieds.

01:30.306 --> 01:32.672
Even Bill gets a couple
of years' credit

01:32.709 --> 01:35.075
for that charade
of a marriage of his.

01:35.111 --> 01:37.477
That's true.

01:37.514 --> 01:39.072
Dang ol' journey,
man, ain't no...

01:39.115 --> 01:40.207
ain't no race.

02:10.013 --> 02:11.480
Boomhauer!

02:11.514 --> 02:12.572
Yo.

02:12.615 --> 02:13.980
Yo!

02:14.017 --> 02:15.382
Katherine Hester, man!

02:18.188 --> 02:20.418
Oh, I can't believe
it's been 12 years.

02:20.456 --> 02:22.583
I just got into town
a half hour ago.

02:22.625 --> 02:25.093
It's like dang ol',
talkin' 'bout destiny, man.

02:25.128 --> 02:27.460
Talkin' 'boutol' planets
aligned, you know,

02:27.497 --> 02:29.294
just like a Big ol' Dipper, man.

02:30.366 --> 02:31.594
Oh man, that dang ol' smile.

02:31.634 --> 02:33.363
You remember getting
our braces caught

02:33.403 --> 02:34.631
and hooked like that, man.

02:34.671 --> 02:36.104
Talkin' 'bout
no pain, no gain.

02:36.139 --> 02:38.107
You know, I've been thinking

02:38.141 --> 02:39.836
about you a lot lately.

02:39.876 --> 02:41.776
Oh, man...
Dang ol' true man?

02:41.811 --> 02:42.903
Well, yeah.

02:42.946 --> 02:44.709
I mean I am marrying
your brother.

02:44.747 --> 02:45.714
You!

02:45.748 --> 02:47.045
You're marrying...
Patch?!

02:47.083 --> 02:48.516
Talkin' 'bout my Patch?!

02:48.551 --> 02:50.815
I guess I'm going to be
Mrs. Boomhauer after all.

02:50.854 --> 02:53.186
I was actually on my way
to the airport to pick him up.

02:53.223 --> 02:55.851
When you see him,
could you act surprised?

02:57.293 --> 02:58.988
That's perfect.

03:05.401 --> 03:08.598
So, your brother's
marrying Katherine.

03:08.638 --> 03:10.572
She made the best beer.

03:10.607 --> 03:11.801
Yup.

03:11.841 --> 03:13.399
Wow, it's like if the Russians

03:13.443 --> 03:15.070
landed on the moon
after we did

03:15.111 --> 03:17.079
and then married it.

03:17.113 --> 03:18.637
Sorry, Boomhauer.

03:18.681 --> 03:20.410
Boomhauer's okay.

03:20.450 --> 03:22.543
He had his chance
to land Katherine

03:22.585 --> 03:23.882
in the boat years ago.

03:23.920 --> 03:25.547
Instead, he cut the line.

03:25.588 --> 03:28.079
Hey, man, it's like,
dang ol' history man.

03:33.863 --> 03:35.125
Yee-ha!

03:36.199 --> 03:37.666
Oh, man, here they come now.

03:37.700 --> 03:39.634
Go act, like, surprised, man!

03:43.072 --> 03:45.233
Gentlemen,
intro-dang-ol'-ducing

03:45.275 --> 03:48.972
daggum future
Mrs. Patch Boomhauer!

03:49.012 --> 03:51.173
Unbelievable.

03:51.214 --> 03:52.054
Katherine, is it not?

03:55.485 --> 03:56.713
Dang ol' stand there,

03:56.753 --> 03:58.015

with that hair

03:58.054 --> 03:59.214
all scruffy on top
that way, man.

03:59.255 --> 04:00.222
Come here.

04:00.256 --> 04:01.245
Yeah, okay.
Man, okay.

04:01.291 --> 04:02.451
Hey, got dang it, man.

04:02.492 --> 04:04.050
Don't wake up
the dang ol' lion, man.

04:06.095 --> 04:06.925
Man, hey, come on.

04:06.963 --> 04:08.863
Hey, hey. Ow. Ow. Ow!

04:08.898 --> 04:11.025
Daggum jaw, man.
Talkin' TMJ, man.

04:16.439 --> 04:17.963
Shoot, man, yeah,
that's what, like,

04:18.007 --> 04:19.634

porta-john business,

04:19.676 --> 04:20.802

04:20.843 --> 04:22.811

04:22.845 --> 04:23.765
Talkin' Andy Dump, man.

04:24.881 --> 04:26.371
Oh, Patch.

04:26.416 --> 04:27.849
Mm, I'll tell you what,

04:27.884 --> 04:30.682
the blood runs hot
in that Boomhauer family.

04:30.720 --> 04:32.483
Yeah, that Patch
got it going on,

04:32.522 --> 04:34.649
but he a dog, I can
smell it from here.

04:34.691 --> 04:35.953
You know, I still remember

04:35.992 --> 04:38.620
the day
Katherine left for London.

04:38.661 --> 04:40.891
Boomhauer stayed in his hot tub
for two straight days.

04:40.930 --> 04:44.866
I have never seen a man look
so unhappy, yet so relaxed.

04:51.107 --> 04:53.166
Bobby, what are you doing?

04:53.209 --> 04:54.471
I want to show Patch

04:54.510 --> 04:56.375
I've got what it takes
to be a ring boy.

04:56.412 --> 04:59.745
It's ring bearer,
and that's Lady bird's job.

04:59.782 --> 05:01.875
Besides, you're old enough
to be an usher.

05:01.918 --> 05:04.148
An usher? Wow!

05:04.187 --> 05:07.020
Sir, come back when
you have a tie.

05:07.056 --> 05:08.489
Yo! Shush it!

05:08.524 --> 05:10.321
Talkin' 'bout since
I was a little boy,

05:10.360 --> 05:12.419
big brother man, fed me
dirt and daggum bugs,

05:12.462 --> 05:14.191
but, you know,
long story short, man,

05:14.230 --> 05:15.822
talkin' 'bout... best man.

05:22.405 --> 05:24.168
Yo.

05:29.278 --> 05:30.438
Very touching,

05:30.480 --> 05:32.345
but something tells me
this is not over.

05:38.054 --> 05:40.488
So, uh, Boomhauer,
how you doing there?

05:40.523 --> 05:41.547
Well, man, you know,

05:41.591 --> 05:43.024

a little warm,

05:43.059 --> 05:44.026
but, you know.

05:46.729 --> 05:48.594
To be thinking of her
as your sister-in-law.

05:48.631 --> 05:50.622
Hey, man, I ain't got no dang
ol' problem here, man,

05:50.666 --> 05:52.906

05:58.908 --> 06:00.205
"We-We're here

06:00.243 --> 06:01.972
to congratulate Patch
and Katherine on..."

06:02.011 --> 06:03.205
Daggum cannonball!

06:05.481 --> 06:07.711
Watch it with that dang
ol' cannonball, man!

06:07.750 --> 06:09.718
Hello,
Mr. Boomhauer.

06:09.752 --> 06:12.050
Thanks for letting me
borrow your Walkman.

06:12.088 --> 06:14.420
I broke it.

06:14.457 --> 06:15.515
Talkin' 'bout meow.
Here, kitty-kitty.

06:15.558 --> 06:16.991

You know, just ol' Patch, man.

06:28.805 --> 06:30.205
Woo-dogs, that's
a sweet taste, man.

06:30.206 --> 06:31.366
Lookin' forward to that meal.

06:31.374 --> 06:32.671
You know, like...

06:34.143 --> 06:35.610
You know you gotta talk

06:35.645 --> 06:37.476

06:37.513 --> 06:40.175
You got, like, vows, man,

06:40.216 --> 06:41.911
Yo man, talkin' 'bout,

06:41.951 --> 06:44.215

Talkin' 'bout fast food, baby!

06:46.155 --> 06:48.020
Dang ol' grow up, man.

06:50.126 --> 06:51.616
Yup.

06:51.661 --> 06:53.060
Yup.

Fight!

06:56.799 --> 06:58.790
Get off me, man!

07:01.504 --> 07:03.131
Now calm down!

07:03.172 --> 07:04.434
Both of you!

07:04.474 --> 07:06.169
I can't understand

07:06.209 --> 07:07.403
Shoot, man, I mean, man,

07:07.443 --> 07:09.035
just talkin' wedding, man,
goes off.

07:09.078 --> 07:10.102
Daggum jealousy, man.

07:10.146 --> 07:11.613
Ugly, green-eyed monster, man.

07:11.647 --> 07:13.706
You must settle this like men.

07:13.749 --> 07:15.182
Angry, redneck men.

07:15.218 --> 07:17.448
Blunderbusses at 20 paces!

07:17.487 --> 07:18.852
Dang it, Boomhauer.

07:18.888 --> 07:20.412
Your brother
is getting married

07:20.456 --> 07:22.151
and you need to start
acting right!

07:22.191 --> 07:23.311
Talkin' 'bout tell him, man!

07:23.326 --> 07:24.623
He's the one wanna

07:24.660 --> 07:27.094

coochie dance, man.

07:27.130 --> 07:28.495
Hey, man, no, you too much
hoochie-coochie man,

07:28.531 --> 07:29.793

07:29.832 --> 07:31.732
Yeah man, you know,
you can't fire me, man,

07:31.767 --> 07:33.200
'cause I tell you what: I quit!

07:35.805 --> 07:37.602
Daggum can't have no wedding
with no best man, man.

07:37.640 --> 07:39.938
Hold the ring, give
the speech, man, you know,

07:39.976 --> 07:41.176
throw the bachelor party, man.

07:41.177 --> 07:44.237
Daggum, man, you know,
talking about, Hank?

07:44.280 --> 07:45.872
Whoa.
Yeah, but...

07:45.915 --> 07:48.349
Me? Your best man?

07:49.652 --> 07:50.846
Well, I...

07:53.556 --> 07:54.784
Patch...

07:54.824 --> 07:56.621
I'd be honored.

08:03.733 --> 08:05.064
Well, what was I going to do?

08:05.101 --> 08:07.194
Let Patch have a wedding
without a best man?

08:07.236 --> 08:09.136
Boomhauer had his chance
with Katherine.

08:09.172 --> 08:11.140
Maybe this is just
the kick in the pants

08:11.174 --> 08:14.610
Boomhauer needs to snap him out
of that Peter Pan lifestyle.

08:14.644 --> 08:15.941
You know, maybe you're right.

08:15.978 --> 08:18.344
He's not getting any younger,

08:18.381 --> 08:19.405
and all the women
he dates are.

08:19.448 --> 08:21.609
Something's got to give.

08:21.651 --> 08:23.448
So, what are Patch
and Katherine

08:23.486 --> 08:24.885
serving at their wedding?

08:24.921 --> 08:27.151
I need to know what
color tux to get...

08:27.190 --> 08:29.351
stain-wise.

08:30.927 --> 08:33.418
Hey, uh, Boomhauer,
we're going to start

08:33.462 --> 08:35.589
planning the bachelor party
at my place tonight.

08:35.631 --> 08:36.996
You want to join us?

08:37.033 --> 08:39.831
Remember how much fun you had
at our bachelor parties?

08:44.874 --> 08:47.104
Hey, Bill, can you
grab me a beer?

08:55.017 --> 08:58.418
Hey, Hank, could you
grab me a beer?

09:03.593 --> 09:05.925
Dang ol' ball and chain, man.

09:07.029 --> 09:08.621
Hey, man, Dale,
why don't you go

09:08.664 --> 09:10.325
and get me a dang ol'
beer, man?

09:12.969 --> 09:15.904
Ah! Wha-What is it,
a bomb?!

09:17.306 --> 09:19.570
I can't lose it! It's after me!

09:19.609 --> 09:20.837
Help!

09:20.876 --> 09:23.276
So what do you say, Boomhauer?

09:23.312 --> 09:25.542
You ready to step back in?

09:25.581 --> 09:27.071
No, man.

09:42.598 --> 09:43.895
Hello, Boomhauer.

09:43.933 --> 09:46.333
I heard you dropped out
as Patch's best man.

09:46.369 --> 09:49.395
I, dang, I don't want to
say nothing 'bout dang ol'...

09:49.438 --> 09:52.339
Dial back the charm,
we've got some talking to do.

09:54.877 --> 09:57.107
I really want us
to work things out

09:57.146 --> 09:59.205
because I couldn't
stand the idea

09:59.248 --> 10:01.682
of my kids not knowing
their Uncle Boomhauer.

10:01.717 --> 10:04.379
Man, it's just dang ol'
complicated, you know, man.

10:04.420 --> 10:06.820
It's like a dang ol'
Rubik's cube, man, like,

10:06.856 --> 10:09.120
talkin' 'bout blue, red, man,
then you get to one side,

10:09.158 --> 10:11.820
then it like messes up
the other side, man.

10:11.861 --> 10:14.329
Well, I truly hope that you'll
at least come to the wedding.

10:14.363 --> 10:17.696
Dang ol', I-I'll-I'll
be there, man.

10:29.545 --> 10:31.035
Hey, Patch.

10:31.080 --> 10:32.809
We're all geared up
for one heck of

10:32.848 --> 10:34.440
a bachelor party
tomorrow night.

10:34.483 --> 10:38.010
We got you three kinds of
sausage and two kinds of pizza.

10:38.054 --> 10:40.716
You can eat yourself silly,
bachelor.

10:40.756 --> 10:42.621
Shoot man, talkin' about
entertainment, man.

10:42.658 --> 10:44.683
Talkin' shake things up, man,
get live, be wild,

10:44.727 --> 10:45.819
you know, talkin' go pro.

10:45.861 --> 10:48.056
Professional entertainers?
Wow.

10:48.097 --> 10:49.496
Daggum right, man.
I'll have him call ya.

10:49.532 --> 10:51.727
You know, dang ol' bring
plenty of singles, huh!

10:54.236 --> 10:56.966
I wish Boomhauer could
see how happy Patch is.

10:57.006 --> 10:59.873
So what do you suppose
the live entertainment is?

10:59.909 --> 11:01.206
Karaoke.

11:02.611 --> 11:05.444
Well, he did say
it would be wild.

11:05.481 --> 11:08.678
<i>Tomorrow night
from 7:00 to 10:00 PM,</i>

11:08.718 --> 11:10.049
the family room is reserved

11:10.086 --> 11:12.452
for a bachelor party.

11:12.488 --> 11:13.682
I've got a variance
from the city.

11:13.723 --> 11:15.623
They're letting us
have 70 decibels.

11:15.658 --> 11:17.023
Same as Bennigan's.

11:17.059 --> 11:18.219
Well, we are having

11:18.260 --> 11:19.989
a bachelorette party
for Katherine,

11:20.029 --> 11:23.931
and Minh is bringing three
Patrick Swayze movies.

11:25.768 --> 11:28.794
Bobby, now I can't
officially invite you

11:28.838 --> 11:30.135
to the bachelor party,

11:30.172 --> 11:31.730
but if a certain usher

11:31.774 --> 11:34.242
sneaked in and had
a Snappy Tom

11:34.276 --> 11:36.710
or maybe some unattended
Collins mixer,

11:36.746 --> 11:38.373
I'd be too busy to notice.

11:41.851 --> 11:43.148
Hill residence.

11:43.185 --> 11:44.865
Yeah, this is Kraig T.
Of KT Entertainment.

11:45.721 --> 11:47.018
Of some special talent
tomorrow night.

11:47.056 --> 11:48.182
Is that correct?

11:48.224 --> 11:50.249
Oh, yes, yes,
the party planner.

11:51.127 --> 11:52.287
Now, the groom mentioned

11:52.328 --> 11:53.590
that he would
like a happy ending.

11:53.629 --> 11:54.596
You cool with that?

11:54.630 --> 11:55.910
Of course, he's getting married!

12:10.546 --> 12:13.276
Oh, man. Dang, dang
ol' beautiful, man.

12:13.315 --> 12:15.340
Oh, I'm sure somehow
it's bad luck

12:15.384 --> 12:18.012
for you to see me in my gown.

12:18.053 --> 12:20.351
Will you try to stop
by Patch's bachelor party?

12:20.389 --> 12:22.016
Knowing Patch,
it'll be pretty tame,

12:22.057 --> 12:25.049
but I'm sure there'll be
good food and good music.

12:25.094 --> 12:26.789
Katherine, man, you know...

12:26.829 --> 12:28.854
I-I don't want to go against
blood or nothin' like that,

12:28.898 --> 12:30.365
but, man, you
know... got...

12:30.399 --> 12:32.867
got to keep a dang
ol' eye on Patch, man.

12:32.902 --> 12:34.995
Boomhauer!

12:37.006 --> 12:39.099
I never thought I'd have
to pull you in the garage

12:39.141 --> 12:41.803
like I do with Bill and Dale.

12:41.844 --> 12:43.471
Hey, man... The time for you
to stop this wedding

12:43.512 --> 12:46.572
was 20 years ago,
before you broke up with Katherine.

12:46.615 --> 12:48.048
You need to grow up.

12:48.083 --> 12:49.209
Patch did.

12:49.251 --> 12:50.851
Now-now-now, you don't
understand, man...

12:50.853 --> 12:52.878
I think I understand plenty,

12:52.922 --> 12:54.321
but you need to suck it up

12:54.356 --> 12:56.017
and get with the program.

13:03.966 --> 13:06.400
Ace high, in your face, sir.

13:06.435 --> 13:09.802
Yeah, look at that... all those
Frito chips are all yours, ol' top.

13:13.943 --> 13:18.004
: Uh, hey, Patch,
can you grab me a beer?

13:24.253 --> 13:26.687
Hold it down, guys.
We're-we're pushing past 60.

13:26.722 --> 13:27.689
Yo, man.

13:28.757 --> 13:30.554
Talkin' 'bout... yo.

13:30.593 --> 13:32.026
Aw...

13:34.063 --> 13:35.462
Be right there!

13:35.498 --> 13:37.193
Everyone hold on to your hats,

13:37.233 --> 13:39.724
'cause the special talent
has just arrived.

13:39.768 --> 13:41.827
Yee-haw!

13:43.239 --> 13:45.070
Hello. You must be Mr. T.

13:45.107 --> 13:46.540
How are you this evening, sir?

13:47.776 --> 13:49.107
Leave the door unlocked
like we discussed?

13:49.144 --> 13:50.168
Yes, sir.

13:51.247 --> 13:54.375
Ah, karaoke.
Dale was right.

13:56.018 --> 13:57.679
Edible underpants...

13:57.720 --> 13:59.483
made from the same stuff
as fruit roll-up,

13:59.522 --> 14:01.149
so don't sit
on anything dusty.

14:01.190 --> 14:03.454
Game time!

14:03.492 --> 14:05.323
<i>101 Bachelorette Party Games.</i>

14:05.361 --> 14:06.828
For the first game,

14:06.862 --> 14:10.491
we will need nail polish
and a summer squash...

14:10.533 --> 14:11.932
Oh! Eh...

14:11.967 --> 14:14.333
Why don't we go see
what the guys are up to?

14:14.370 --> 14:16.167
Gentlemen, there's
only one rule,

14:16.205 --> 14:17.797
and that is to have fun...

14:17.840 --> 14:20.331
and to tip generously.

14:20.376 --> 14:21.843
Well, since you're here
to emcee,

14:21.877 --> 14:23.777
I'm going to go get
the hot wings.

14:23.812 --> 14:25.439
I could use a little help.

14:26.649 --> 14:28.344
Gents, there is
a special menu available

14:28.384 --> 14:29.510
for special requests,

14:29.552 --> 14:30.610
all right, huh,

14:30.653 --> 14:31.677
okay, all right?

14:31.720 --> 14:33.187
Now let's get the bachelor!

14:33.222 --> 14:36.123
Patch, Patch, Patch, Patch,

14:36.158 --> 14:37.989
Patch, Patch!

14:40.329 --> 14:42.320
Dang, man, ol',
don't, no way, man,

14:42.364 --> 14:44.195
talkin' 'bout dang ol' sanctity
of marriage, man.

14:44.233 --> 14:45.359
Just dang ol' get on out.

14:45.401 --> 14:46.698
Daggum, mine all mine, man.

14:46.735 --> 14:47.861
Talkin' primed and ready.

14:47.903 --> 14:49.336
Here, here's some
dang ol' money.

14:49.371 --> 14:51.931
Now-now, you just dang ol' get
on out of here, man.

14:51.974 --> 14:53.532
Hold on now. Come on, baby.

14:53.576 --> 14:55.840
We need a bedroom story, man,
talking "Once Upon My Lap."

14:55.878 --> 14:57.607
Get 'em while they're hot!

14:57.646 --> 14:59.546
Wow! You didn't
tell me

14:59.582 --> 15:01.482
about this part, Dad.

15:01.517 --> 15:04.486
Bobby, close your eyes
and go to your room.

15:06.055 --> 15:08.080
Boomhauer, what are you doing?

15:10.859 --> 15:12.724
Patch?

15:12.761 --> 15:14.160
Daggum ol' help!

15:14.196 --> 15:15.823
Boomhauer, told you
no hanky and panky.

15:15.864 --> 15:17.729
Dang ol' hijacked
by Boom-hos.

15:17.766 --> 15:18.926
Is this true?

15:18.968 --> 15:20.458
Boomhauer, did you pay

15:20.502 --> 15:21.662
for these women to...

15:21.704 --> 15:23.171
I can't believe you!

15:23.205 --> 15:25.173
Marriage may not mean
anything to you,

15:25.207 --> 15:27.835
but it means a lot
to Patch and me and Buck

15:27.876 --> 15:29.400
and everyone else here!

15:29.445 --> 15:31.003
Hey, man, now I'm talkin'
'bout ol' dang ol'...

15:31.046 --> 15:32.343
I don't want to hear it!

15:32.381 --> 15:35.839
Now take your hired floozies
and get the hell out!

15:35.884 --> 15:37.215
Now, Boomhauer!

15:44.426 --> 15:47.862
Guys night out, man,
talkin'... girls?

15:47.896 --> 15:48.954
Why?

16:00.409 --> 16:02.343
I really thought
Boomhauer had come around.

16:02.378 --> 16:04.039
I mean, he brought beer...

16:04.079 --> 16:06.513
but then...
the prostitutes.

16:06.548 --> 16:09.016
Maybe you can work that
into your best man speech

16:09.051 --> 16:10.848
at the rehearsal dinner.

16:10.886 --> 16:12.786
You know, in a funny way.

16:12.821 --> 16:13.913
What really bugs me

16:13.956 --> 16:16.857
is that Boomhauer
flat out lied to me.

16:16.892 --> 16:20.350
It makes me question
our entire friendship.

16:20.396 --> 16:23.456
Whore monger, yes;
liar, unproven.

16:23.499 --> 16:26.366
Technically, Boomhauer
did not lie to your face.

16:26.402 --> 16:28.734
You merely assume
that he lied.

16:28.771 --> 16:30.204
Wait a minute. You're right.

16:30.239 --> 16:31.866
I never asked Boomhauer

16:31.907 --> 16:34.034
if he tried to break up
Patch and Katherine,

16:34.076 --> 16:36.704
so he hasn't actually lied
to me yet.

16:36.745 --> 16:39.543
If I go to Boomhauer,
and he comes clean, well...

16:39.581 --> 16:42.311
maybe there's a chance
we can still be friends.

16:44.086 --> 16:47.681
Does this suit smell like
embalming fluid to you?

16:50.526 --> 16:51.857
Now, Boomhauer,

16:51.894 --> 16:53.486
as a man, I'm obligated

16:53.529 --> 16:56.657
to try to salvage our friendship
of over 30 years

16:56.699 --> 16:58.758
by asking you
some tough questions.

17:01.403 --> 17:03.303
Do you love Katherine Hester?

17:03.338 --> 17:04.964
Yo, man.

17:05.007 --> 17:08.374
And does the thought of Patch
marrying her tear you up inside?

17:08.410 --> 17:09.968
Yo, man.

17:10.012 --> 17:13.175
And did you hire those ladies
of easy virtue

17:13.214 --> 17:15.512
to frame Patch
and break up the wedding?

17:20.923 --> 17:22.550
No, man.

17:22.590 --> 17:24.422
Oh, Boomhauer,

17:24.460 --> 17:26.257
I am so sorry
for doubting you.

17:26.295 --> 17:27.387
Well, wait a minute.

17:27.429 --> 17:29.693
If you didn't hire
those girls, then...

17:29.732 --> 17:31.199
Kraig T?!

17:31.233 --> 17:33.531
Oh, God, Patch knew all along!

17:33.569 --> 17:35.230
Dang ol' yeah, man,

17:35.270 --> 17:36.794
now-now, talkin'
'bout d-don't get hurt

17:36.839 --> 17:38.919
falling off that dang ol'
high horse, man. Boomhauer,

17:38.941 --> 17:40.704
I deserve all that and more,

17:40.743 --> 17:42.870
but right now I need
to get to the rehearsal dinner

17:42.911 --> 17:44.401
and set things right.

17:44.446 --> 17:47.142
I'll give Patch
the "happy ending" he deserves,

17:47.182 --> 17:48.308
I tell you what.

17:59.528 --> 18:02.497
Dang ol', where's
the best man, daggum, Hank?

18:02.531 --> 18:04.431
Gotta give speech, man,
talkin' 'bout...

18:04.466 --> 18:06.764
"Life's funny sometimes..."
like that, man.

18:06.802 --> 18:09.327
Oh, my God, your
Hank is dead-on.

18:09.371 --> 18:11.430
You know, I do a great Bobby.

18:11.473 --> 18:13.703
Excuse me, sir.

18:13.742 --> 18:16.006
We have a hard
7:00 start time,

18:16.044 --> 18:17.341
so I'm going to...

18:18.680 --> 18:19.942
There Boomhauer.

18:19.982 --> 18:22.382
We get a good fight,
it make up for cash bar.

18:28.891 --> 18:30.859
Uh, sorry I'm late.

18:32.761 --> 18:36.959
Hank Hill,
Best Man, Strickland Propane.

18:36.999 --> 18:39.866
When people get married,
as these two plan tomorrow,

18:39.902 --> 18:42.200
you've got to act right.

18:42.237 --> 18:43.499
You've got to have commitment,

18:43.539 --> 18:46.440
devotion, trust.

18:46.475 --> 18:48.136
You can't be fooling around,

18:48.177 --> 18:50.077
and you surely can't be...

18:50.112 --> 18:52.774
There's something
I have to say.

18:52.815 --> 18:55.443
When Patch first
asked me to marry him,

18:55.484 --> 18:57.315
it was a dream come true...

18:58.654 --> 19:00.144
...but when I got here,

19:00.189 --> 19:03.647
I realized how much Patch
reminded me of Boomhauer,

19:03.692 --> 19:06.820
and that I might be trying
to recapture something I lost.

19:07.830 --> 19:09.320
And then Boomhauer hired

19:09.364 --> 19:10.991
a bunch of prostitutes

19:11.033 --> 19:14.002
to make me think Patch
was some kind of pervert...

19:14.036 --> 19:15.901
and I hated him for it...

19:19.474 --> 19:23.672
...but it was that desperate,
crazy, romantic move

19:23.712 --> 19:27.011
that made me realize
maybe there is something

19:27.049 --> 19:29.677
still between Boomhauer
and me.

19:29.718 --> 19:31.185
I'm sorry, Patch.

19:31.220 --> 19:32.778
I cannot marry you.

19:33.922 --> 19:35.014
Well, now hold on, baby.

19:35.057 --> 19:36.024
Now, daggum, no, man.

19:36.058 --> 19:37.025
It was all me.

19:37.059 --> 19:38.686
Yeah, all me.

19:38.727 --> 19:40.024
Talkin' 'bout frequent buyer,

19:40.062 --> 19:41.859
spent Thanksgiving
with them hos, man.

19:43.031 --> 19:44.157
Oh, my!

19:44.199 --> 19:46.497
You're the one who hired
those strippers?

19:46.535 --> 19:47.524
Dang straight, baby.

19:47.569 --> 19:49.161
Dang ol' hopeless romantic.

19:49.204 --> 19:50.796
Uh, no.

19:50.839 --> 19:53.865
Boomhauer hired them because he
couldn't stand to see us together

19:53.909 --> 19:56.036
is a grand romantic gesture.

19:56.078 --> 19:58.205
You hiring them is...

19:58.247 --> 20:00.715
just plain sleazy.

20:00.749 --> 20:02.717
It's over, Patch.

20:02.751 --> 20:05.549
Dang ol', no, baby, talkin'
'bout not me, man, talkin'...

20:05.587 --> 20:09.079
Hank! Dang ol' Hank
<i>loves</i> hookers, man.

20:12.761 --> 20:15.389
Well, here we are
saying good-bye again.

20:15.430 --> 20:17.227
Don't worry. I'm not
going to do a donut

20:17.266 --> 20:19.234
in your front lawn this time.

20:19.268 --> 20:22.726
I just need to go
away for a while

20:22.771 --> 20:24.534
and get my head together.

20:24.573 --> 20:27.565
Hey, man, talkin' 'bout like
a dang ol' roller coaster, man.

20:27.609 --> 20:29.406
You know, I talk...
we talk about destiny,

20:29.444 --> 20:31.071
and that Big ol' Dipper,
man, you know,

20:31.113 --> 20:33.581
well, it's just like a...
like a dang ol' North Star, man,

20:33.615 --> 20:35.082
and I always will
be there, man,

20:35.117 --> 20:37.950
you know, just like
a dang ol' GPS...

20:39.021 --> 20:40.784
I feel the same way.

20:58.907 --> 21:02.035
Hey, um, dang ol' Hank,
man, you know,

21:02.077 --> 21:03.669
talkin' 'bout, like,
that dang ol' day

21:03.712 --> 21:05.202
might never not ever come,
you know,

21:05.247 --> 21:07.215
but if it do, man,
you know, I...

21:07.249 --> 21:10.707
you know, man, I might be puttin' a
little ol' call on... on you, man.

21:10.752 --> 21:13.050
Well, Boomhauer,
I'd be honored.
