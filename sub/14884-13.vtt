21:32.424 --> 21:34.393

22:08.360 --> 22:12.164
<i>What you need to do
is visualize walking with a child.</i>

22:12.230 --> 22:14.866
<i>You need to see your daughter
playing with the child.</i>

22:21.740 --> 22:26.044

22:34.119 --> 22:37.923
<i>And astrologically, it's got to be
the right time for that child to come in.</i>

22:37.989 --> 22:39.991
<i>Do what the doctor is telling you.</i>

22:40.058 --> 22:42.627

How long are you going to stay in Paris?

23:32.344 --> 23:34.045
Isn't it so great?

23:49.227 --> 23:50.929
How did you put up with this?

24:34.105 --> 24:37.542
I will see if I can find
some handsome guys around.

24:40.846 --> 24:42.180
Are you single, too?

24:45.183 --> 24:48.887
Okay, so we don't have
to deal with you, then.

24:48.954 --> 24:50.055
Boring.

24:57.529 --> 24:58.463
<i>Bye-bye.</i>

25:40.105 --> 25:41.273
Guys, this isn't funny.

25:41.339 --> 25:43.275
I have an appointment!

25:44.309 --> 25:47.112
Tell everyone to get in the car!

25:47.178 --> 25:49.281
No.

We're already 15 minutes past
and Kourtney's not even in the car.

We're leaving!

26:16.775 --> 26:19.811
-How far away are we?
-Six miles, I think.

26:31.590 --> 26:33.224
I wonder how cold that water is.

26:35.560 --> 26:36.695
Could've gone on that last run.

29:33.071 --> 29:40.078
I pray that everything
is nice in the world.

29:40.145 --> 29:42.413
And everything is good.

32:10.028 --> 32:11.195
A little bit of pressure.

32:28.379 --> 32:30.481
I'm putting a little bit of pressure
right now.

32:31.449 --> 32:32.750
Relax your knees a tiny bit for me.

32:32.817 --> 32:35.520
Mom, are you holding her hand?

32:35.586 --> 32:37.555
You'll feel a little bit of cramping.

32:38.923 --> 32:40.458
You're almost done.

32:46.297 --> 32:47.365
Deep breath.

32:56.074 --> 32:57.875
Okay, you're all done. Great job.
