look so soft, don't they?

01:11.450 --> 01:13.160
Like you could just jump down

01:13.250 --> 01:15.660
and you'd land in a big, soft,
cottony heap.

01:15.750 --> 01:17.210
Maybe you should give it a try.

01:17.290 --> 01:18.500
You're hilarious.

01:18.750 --> 01:20.090
I'll try it!

01:20.170 --> 01:21.420
Ha ha ha!

01:23.260 --> 01:25.340
Yeah!

01:30.640 --> 01:32.350
Turns out, clouds are made of water.

01:37.640 --> 01:39.520
Hey, what is that?

01:44.150 --> 01:45.650
It's like a scar.

SOKKA: Listen.

01:51.740 --> 01:53.700
It's so quiet.

There's no life anywhere.

Aang, are you ok?

01:58.160 --> 01:59.210

Shh.

Why would anyone do this?

02:12.640 --> 02:14.470
How could I let this happen?

02:14.560 --> 02:16.810
Aang, you didn't let this happen.

02:17.020 --> 02:18.480
It has nothing to do with you.

02:18.690 --> 02:20.310
Yes, it does.

02:20.400 --> 02:22.650
It's the avatar's job
to protect nature,

02:22.980 --> 02:24.690
but I don't know how to do my job.

02:24.770 --> 02:26.610
That's why we're going
to the North Pole―

02:26.690 --> 02:28.190
To find you a teacher.

02:28.450 --> 02:30.530
Yeah. A waterbending teacher.

02:30.610 --> 02:33.330
But there's no one who can
teach me how to be the Avatar.

02:33.410 --> 02:36.080
Monk Gyatso said
that Avatar Roku would help me.

02:36.290 --> 02:38.040
The Avatar before you?

02:38.250 --> 02:39.580
He died over a hundred years ago.

Over here.

Uncle?

02:55.680 --> 02:56.720
We need to move on.

02:56.810 --> 02:58.600
We're closing in
on the Avatar's trail,

02:58.680 --> 03:00.600
and I don't want to lose him.

03:01.060 --> 03:03.610
You look tired, Prince Zuko.

03:03.810 --> 03:07.030
Why don't you join me
in these hot springs

03:07.110 --> 03:09.820
and soak away your troubles?

03:10.030 --> 03:12.200
My troubles cannot be soaked away.

03:12.280 --> 03:13.620
It's time to go!

03:13.950 --> 03:16.330
You should take your teacher's advice

03:16.410 --> 03:18.410
and relax a little.

03:18.500 --> 03:21.540
The temperature's just right.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.210
I heated it myself.

03:27.090 --> 03:29.380
Enough. We need to leave now.

03:29.460 --> 03:30.470
Get out of the water!

03:30.840 --> 03:32.180
Very well.

03:32.260 --> 03:33.300
On second thought,

03:33.390 --> 03:35.220
why don't you take
another few minutes?

03:35.430 --> 03:37.100
But be back at the ship
in half an hour,

03:37.180 --> 03:38.430
or I'm leaving without you.

03:38.850 --> 03:40.180
Ahh.

KATARA: Hey, Aang.

Are you ready to be cheered up?

No.

03:46.400 --> 03:47.400
Ow!

03:48.690 --> 03:50.490
Hey, how is that cheering me up?

03:50.940 --> 03:51.950
( CHUCKLING )

03:52.030 --> 03:53.030
Cheered me up.

03:53.110 --> 03:54.110
Ow!

03:54.200 --> 03:56.120
Yeah, I probably deserved that.

03:57.080 --> 03:59.370
These acorns are everywhere, Aang.

04:00.370 --> 04:02.540
That means the forest will grow back.

04:02.620 --> 04:05.250
Every one of these will be
a tall oak tree someday,

04:05.330 --> 04:06.670
and all the birds and animals

04:06.750 --> 04:08.090
that lived here will come back.

04:15.590 --> 04:17.390
SOKKA: Hey, who are you?

04:17.600 --> 04:19.560
When I saw the flying bison,

04:19.850 --> 04:21.600
I thought it was impossible,

04:21.810 --> 04:23.890
but those markings...

04:24.190 --> 04:26.770
Are you the Avatar, child?

04:29.570 --> 04:31.990
My village
desperately needs your help.

04:45.790 --> 04:49.460
This young person is the Avatar.

04:49.540 --> 04:52.590
So the rumors of your return are true.

04:52.880 --> 04:54.760
It is the greatest honor of a lifetime

04:54.840 --> 04:56.430
to be in your presence.

04:56.630 --> 04:58.050
Nice to meet you, too.

05:00.310 --> 05:02.810
So, is there something
I can help you with?

05:02.890 --> 05:04.850
I'm not sure.

05:05.310 --> 05:06.810
Our village is in crisis.

05:06.900 --> 05:08.810
He's our only hope.

05:09.440 --> 05:11.860
For the last few days at sunset,

05:12.070 --> 05:15.240
a spirit monster comes
and attacks our village.

05:15.820 --> 05:17.490
He is Hei Bai,

05:17.570 --> 05:19.740
the black and white spirit.

05:20.070 --> 05:21.370
Why is it attacking you?

05:21.740 --> 05:23.160
We do not know.

05:23.540 --> 05:25.120
But each of the last three nights,

05:25.210 --> 05:27.000
he has abducted one of our own.

05:27.080 --> 05:28.670
We are especially fearful

05:28.750 --> 05:30.590
because the winter solstice
draws near.

05:30.790 --> 05:32.340
What happens then?

05:32.420 --> 05:34.340
As the solstice approaches,

05:34.670 --> 05:36.970
the natural world and the spirit world

05:37.050 --> 05:39.010
grow closer and closer,

05:39.220 --> 05:40.600
until the line between them

05:40.680 --> 05:42.600
is blurred completely.

05:43.430 --> 05:46.770
Hei Bai is already causing
devastation and destruction.

05:46.850 --> 05:48.600
Once the solstice is here,

05:48.690 --> 05:51.020
there is no telling what will happen.

05:51.360 --> 05:53.690
So what do you want me to do exactly?

05:53.900 --> 05:55.650
Who better to resolve a crisis

05:55.740 --> 05:58.530
between our world and the spirit world

05:58.610 --> 06:00.870
than the Avatar himself?

06:01.070 --> 06:02.620
You are the great bridge

06:02.830 --> 06:04.740
between man and spirits.

06:04.950 --> 06:07.370
Right. That's me.

06:07.620 --> 06:09.210
Hey, great bridge guy.

06:09.290 --> 06:10.920
Can I talk to you over here
for a second?

06:12.960 --> 06:15.880
Aang, you seem a little
unsure about all this.

06:16.170 --> 06:18.420
Yeah. That might be because
I don't know anything at all

06:18.510 --> 06:19.680
about the spirit world.

06:21.550 --> 06:23.810
It's not like there's someone
to teach me this stuff.

06:24.180 --> 06:26.310
So, can you help these people?

06:26.390 --> 06:28.180
I have to try, don't I?

06:29.020 --> 06:30.730
Maybe whatever I have to do
will just...

06:30.810 --> 06:31.810

07:59.730 --> 08:02.070
If anyone can save us, he can.

face this alone.

Your brother is in good hands.

12:57.870 --> 12:59.030
I would be shocked

12:59.120 --> 13:01.490
if the Avatar returned without him.

13:01.990 --> 13:04.910
Katara? Katara, I lost him.

13:07.790 --> 13:09.460
The sun is rising.

13:10.340 --> 13:12.760
Perhaps he will return soon.

13:12.840 --> 13:14.670
What? No. I'm right here.

13:14.760 --> 13:15.760
Grr!

13:15.840 --> 13:17.430
( GRUNTING )

13:23.720 --> 13:25.640
I'm in the spirit world.

13:33.820 --> 13:36.570
Ugh. Yep, that's Uncle Iroh.

13:40.780 --> 13:43.080
AANG: I'll figure this out, Katara.
I promise.

13:43.490 --> 13:45.000
Like they said, I'm the bridge

13:45.080 --> 13:46.830
between the worlds, right?

13:46.910 --> 13:49.750
All I have to do
is figure out what I have to do,

13:50.130 --> 13:51.590
but once I do that, no problem.

13:53.130 --> 13:54.130
( GROWLING )

13:54.210 --> 13:55.880
Appa. Hey, buddy. I'm right here.

13:58.220 --> 14:00.470
But I guess you can't see me, either.

14:01.470 --> 14:02.560
( DULL ROAR )

14:02.640 --> 14:04.390
It's ok, Appa. Don't worry.

14:04.810 --> 14:06.390
I'm sure they're on their way back.

14:06.480 --> 14:08.890
I bet they even found you
a bunch of moon peaches,

14:08.980 --> 14:10.060
for a treat.

14:12.520 --> 14:14.320
What am I supposed to do?

14:15.030 --> 14:17.450
Avatar Roku, how can I talk to you?

14:19.990 --> 14:20.990
Sokka?

14:25.750 --> 14:27.410
( GROWLING )

14:27.500 --> 14:29.580
That's definitely not Sokka.

14:31.960 --> 14:33.000
Uhh!

14:38.920 --> 14:40.300
What?

14:40.630 --> 14:42.890
I can't airbend in the spirit world.

14:46.350 --> 14:47.390
( GROWLING )

14:52.060 --> 14:53.610
( GROWLING )

14:58.570 --> 15:00.610
You don't know where Sokka is, do you?

15:03.530 --> 15:04.530
( WHIMPERING )

15:11.120 --> 15:13.750
You're Avatar Roku's animal guide,

15:13.830 --> 15:15.500
like Appa is to me.

15:15.590 --> 15:17.960
I need to save my friend,
and I don't know how.

15:18.050 --> 15:20.260
Is there some way for me
to talk to Roku?

15:25.220 --> 15:26.720
I'll be back, Katara.

15:28.310 --> 15:29.680
Take me to Roku.

15:41.570 --> 15:42.780
( GASP )

15:45.240 --> 15:46.410
Oh.

15:46.490 --> 15:47.700
What's the problem?

15:48.410 --> 15:49.410
Nothing.

15:50.120 --> 15:53.790
Actually, there is a bit of a problem.

15:53.870 --> 15:56.960
My old joints
are feeling sore and achy,

15:57.040 --> 15:59.510
and these shackles are too loose.

15:59.590 --> 16:00.840
Too loose?

16:01.170 --> 16:03.180
That's right. The cuffs are loose,

16:03.260 --> 16:06.220
and they jangle around
and bump my wrists.

16:06.300 --> 16:08.850
It would help me
if you would tighten them

16:08.930 --> 16:11.350
so they wouldn't shake around so much.

16:11.680 --> 16:12.810
Very well.

16:12.890 --> 16:14.900
Corporal, tighten
the prisoner's handcuffs.

16:21.240 --> 16:23.700
Aah!

16:23.780 --> 16:24.820
Aah!

16:27.700 --> 16:28.700
Aah!

16:42.630 --> 16:44.050
AANG: Hey! What are you doing?!

16:44.130 --> 16:46.010
Aah!

16:52.020 --> 16:53.560
I don't understand.

16:53.640 --> 16:55.310
This is just a statue of Roku.

17:05.070 --> 17:07.490
Is that what Roku
wants to talk to me about?

17:07.570 --> 17:08.820
A comet?

17:09.740 --> 17:10.740
When can I talk to him?

17:11.790 --> 17:12.870
( GROWLING )

17:38.900 --> 17:40.310
It's a calendar,

17:40.400 --> 17:42.690
and the light will reach Roku
on the solstice.

17:43.650 --> 17:45.740
So that's when I'll be able
to speak to Roku?

17:45.820 --> 17:47.400
( GROWLING )

17:47.780 --> 17:49.370
But I can't wait that long.

17:49.450 --> 17:51.240
I need to save Sokka now!

17:54.080 --> 17:55.160
Ugh! Uhh!

17:56.790 --> 17:57.790
Hyah!

18:05.090 --> 18:07.680
He is too dangerous, captain.

18:07.760 --> 18:09.510
We can't just carry him
to the capital.

18:09.590 --> 18:11.180
We have to do something now.

18:11.260 --> 18:12.600
I agree.

18:12.680 --> 18:13.810
He must be dealt with immediately

18:13.890 --> 18:15.770
and severely.

18:15.850 --> 18:16.890
Ptoh!

18:19.600 --> 18:21.980
KATARA: It's no use, Appa.
I don't see them anywhere.

18:22.730 --> 18:25.280
Our best hope is to go back
to the village and wait.

18:25.570 --> 18:26.900
( APPA GROWLS )

18:47.170 --> 18:48.510
Whoa.

Aah!

19:18.870 --> 19:20.160
You're back!

19:21.750 --> 19:23.130

I'm not sure.

must be crushed.

Excellent form, Prince Zuko.

You taught me well.

Uh, that's true,

but you are clearly outmatched.

21:20.030 --> 21:22.040
You're the spirit of this forest.

21:22.120 --> 21:23.830
Now I understand.

21:24.200 --> 21:25.540
You're upset and angry

21:25.620 --> 21:27.170
because your home was burned down.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.750
When I saw the forest had burned,

21:29.840 --> 21:30.960
I was sad and upset,

21:31.040 --> 21:32.670
but my friend gave me hope

21:32.750 --> 21:33.960
that the forest would grow back.

Sokka!

21:57.320 --> 21:58.320
What happened?

21:58.410 --> 22:01.450
You were trapped in the spirit world
for 24 hours.

22:01.530 --> 22:02.780
How are you feeling?

22:02.870 --> 22:04.580

to use the bathroom.

22:07.080 --> 22:08.830
Thank you, Avatar.

22:08.920 --> 22:10.420
If only there were a way

22:10.500 --> 22:12.000
to repay you for what you've done.

22:12.340 --> 22:14.920
You could give us
some supplies and some money.

22:15.130 --> 22:16.340
- Sokka.
- What?

22:16.420 --> 22:17.720
We need stuff.

22:18.590 --> 22:22.100
It would be an honor
to help you prepare for your journey.

22:22.430 --> 22:24.310
I'm so proud of you, Aang.

22:24.390 --> 22:26.600
You figured out what to do
all on your own.

22:26.810 --> 22:29.270
Actually, I did have a little help.

22:29.480 --> 22:30.770
And there's something else.

22:34.730 --> 22:35.730
What is it?

22:35.820 --> 22:37.030
I need to talk to Roku,

22:37.110 --> 22:38.360
and I think I found a way

22:38.450 --> 22:39.780
to contact his spirit.

22:39.860 --> 22:42.490
- That's great.
- Creepy, but great.

22:42.570 --> 22:44.950
There's a temple
on a crescent-shaped island,

22:45.040 --> 22:46.620
and if I go there on the solstice,

22:46.700 --> 22:48.250
I'll be able to speak with him.

22:48.710 --> 22:50.790
But the solstice is tomorrow.

22:50.870 --> 22:53.000
Yeah, and there's one more problem.

22:53.090 --> 22:54.880
The island is in the Fire Nation.
