00:01.479 --> 00:03.953
Robbery isn't as bad as killing a man,

00:03.988 --> 00:05.639
and you got me off on that.

00:05.674 --> 00:08.019
There are only two get out of jail
free cards in the game,

00:08.019 --> 00:09.432
and you've used them both up.

00:09.432 --> 00:10.768
Say hello to Grandpa.

00:10.804 --> 00:12.296
Hi, paw paw.

00:12.331 --> 00:14.104
Hi. Hello, sweetheart.

00:14.105 --> 00:15.506
Rachel is using again.

00:15.541 --> 00:17.310
I've decided to do an intervention.

00:17.310 --> 00:17.997
And Fiona?

00:17.998 --> 00:20.145
I'll assume custody until Rachel is well.

00:20.145 --> 00:23.620
We always said what a mistake
it was for us to get married.

00:23.620 --> 00:25.333
Maybe the blunder was splitting up.

00:25.333 --> 00:28.143
You are getting married,
and you're kissing another woman.

00:28.143 --> 00:30.583
Not just any woman. I promise.

00:32.000 --> 00:38.074
Learn the unknown English words
of this movie at www.skeebdo.com

00:39.062 --> 00:42.204
As a concession for keeping
the cottage in cape may,

00:42.239 --> 00:45.381
you're willing to give up
the house in Great Barrington.

00:45.381 --> 00:48.055
And the antique pewter
valued at over $70,000.

00:48.055 --> 00:50.659
A considerable gesture of goodwill
on your part.

00:50.659 --> 00:53.599
However, there's something that
Natalie's determined to get her hands on,

00:53.599 --> 00:55.874
and I simply can't permit it…

00:56.228 --> 00:58.094
My Victorian Erotica collection.

00:58.094 --> 01:00.100
Vic… what?

01:00.101 --> 01:01.259
Victorian Erotica.

01:01.294 --> 01:02.748
As I'm sure you're aware,
much like today,

01:02.748 --> 01:05.620
the late 1800s were
a socially conservative time.

01:05.620 --> 01:07.277
During repressive eras…

01:07.313 --> 01:08.626
Pornography thrives.

01:08.662 --> 01:10.621
We prefer “Erotica”.

01:10.656 --> 01:12.858
She's in possession of
my premier collection

01:12.858 --> 01:15.474
of Victorian Erotica
in the western hemisphere.

01:15.474 --> 01:18.184
I intend for it to be
my legacy to the world.

01:18.508 --> 01:20.965
Um… Just so I'm clear here,

01:21.000 --> 01:24.409
we're talking about literature, photos…

01:24.444 --> 01:25.426
And machinery.

01:25.461 --> 01:26.408
Machinery?

01:26.444 --> 01:29.737
The Victorian Era was the height
of the industrial age.

01:29.737 --> 01:32.995
Whenever new technology arrives,
its first use is erotica.

01:32.995 --> 01:34.296
Much like the Internet…

01:34.296 --> 01:35.200
and Internet porn.

01:35.200 --> 01:35.852
Erotica.

01:35.887 --> 01:38.418
No, that stuff's just porn.

01:38.419 --> 01:43.786
Um, Clifford, was any of this erotica
acquired during your marriage?

01:45.782 --> 01:47.312
All of it, actually.

01:47.347 --> 01:52.582
Well, then legally, Natalie is entitled
to a significant portion of the collection.

01:52.617 --> 01:56.912
Shirley, my family's money and affairs
has been connected to this firm

01:56.948 --> 02:00.690
since you opened your doors.
I want my collection.

02:00.725 --> 02:02.369
You'll never get it, Clifford.

02:02.369 --> 02:04.697
And you must be Natalie.

02:07.325 --> 02:09.080
Shirl.

02:09.116 --> 02:10.839
Ivan?

02:41.866 --> 02:43.851
You don't normally practice family law.

02:43.851 --> 02:45.962
What are you doing on a divorce case?

02:45.962 --> 02:49.041
Professor Cabot's estate
has strong ties to the firm.

02:49.041 --> 02:51.402
He wanted me. And you?

02:51.437 --> 02:53.228
I wanted you.

02:54.065 --> 02:56.001
As a matter of full disclosure,

02:56.036 --> 02:59.249
Mr Tiggs and I were once
married many years ago

02:59.284 --> 03:02.462
and could conceivably present
a conflict of interest.

03:02.462 --> 03:06.827
Either one or both of you would be
advised to request change of counsel.

03:06.862 --> 03:08.872
I'm not giving up my attorney.

03:12.469 --> 03:14.870
No takers? Great.

03:15.268 --> 03:16.970
Shall we?

03:23.718 --> 03:25.601
You don't want to tear apart a collection.

03:25.601 --> 03:27.414
That's why it's called “a collection”.

03:27.414 --> 03:29.446
If you spent a little less time
with the collection,

03:29.446 --> 03:31.017
we might not be here
dividing it up now.

03:31.017 --> 03:31.407
People!

03:31.407 --> 03:33.880
Before you met me, you'd never
even heard of “The Lusty Turk”…

03:33.880 --> 03:34.232
Clifford…

03:34.232 --> 03:38.423
If not for me, “Two Circus Virgins”
would be hanging over someone else's
fireplace.

03:38.423 --> 03:41.438
Natalie, Clifford, if neither of you
can budge on this,

03:41.438 --> 03:45.643
then we will end up in court and a judge
will decide your collection's future.

03:45.643 --> 03:46.408
Fine.

03:47.012 --> 03:48.438
Now why don't we take a break and see

03:48.438 --> 03:51.524
if we can come up
with a better resolution tomorrow.

03:51.524 --> 03:52.483
That's fine.

03:52.518 --> 03:54.008
I'll be right down.

03:54.043 --> 03:55.417
I'll call you.

04:02.675 --> 04:04.837
I thought they'd never leave.

04:05.176 --> 04:08.527
So how is the missus… missy?

04:09.372 --> 04:11.280
The honeymoon was exceptional.

04:11.315 --> 04:12.053
Guadalupe?

04:12.055 --> 04:16.035
An atrociously dull island. Nothing to
do but have sex all day and night.

04:16.035 --> 04:18.940
By the way, Shirley, I'm having an affair.

04:18.975 --> 04:21.310
Huh. Ivan, you do not disappoint.

04:21.346 --> 04:22.881
You've been married four weeks.

04:22.881 --> 04:23.722
Seemed like five.

04:23.722 --> 04:25.137
And whom are you having the affair with?

04:25.137 --> 04:27.114
You.

04:27.115 --> 04:30.290
Well, so far it hasn't been very good for me.

04:30.325 --> 04:33.804
I'm not sure if you follow
the morning network news shows,

04:33.804 --> 04:35.517
but I caught a couple on the island.

04:35.517 --> 04:38.669
And according to the experts,
one doesn't have to actually

04:38.669 --> 04:41.786
have a physical relationship
to be considered a cheater.

04:41.786 --> 04:42.717
No kidding?

04:42.752 --> 04:43.649
No kidding.

04:43.650 --> 04:46.376
If our friendship…

04:46.411 --> 04:48.064
Let's just call it that…

04:48.099 --> 04:50.604
is deeper than my primary relationship,

04:50.639 --> 04:53.999
them technically I'm emotionally
cheating on my wife.

04:54.034 --> 04:57.460
That's what Katie and Matt say,
and they both have such trusting faces.

04:57.460 --> 05:00.844
Besides humor you, what can I do?

05:02.184 --> 05:05.500
Admit you're having
an emotional affair with me.

05:05.535 --> 05:08.816
Consider making it physical, since, after all,

05:08.851 --> 05:11.151
we're already halfway there…

05:11.694 --> 05:13.674
And let's call it a day.

05:14.141 --> 05:15.621
I have a better idea,

05:15.656 --> 05:20.059
and I'm sure it's something
Katie and Matt came up with as well.

05:20.094 --> 05:22.685
Go home to your wife, Ivan.

05:22.720 --> 05:25.277
Are you breaking up with me?

05:25.687 --> 05:27.926
Go home to your wife.

05:35.996 --> 05:38.598
Shirley, you know I don't play fair.

05:38.633 --> 05:42.032
That's one of the many reasons you love me.

06:04.096 --> 06:06.012
Did you pack my jean nate?

06:06.047 --> 06:07.733
Yes, I packed your jean Nate.

06:07.733 --> 06:09.721
What about my nighttime eye patches?

06:09.721 --> 06:13.369
I can't sleep without my nighttime eye patches.

06:19.396 --> 06:21.030
Evening, Adele.

06:21.065 --> 06:22.665
Step on it!

06:27.004 --> 06:29.275
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait!

06:29.310 --> 06:31.287
Mrs Piper!

06:31.322 --> 06:33.816
I have warned you before about this.

06:33.851 --> 06:35.753
You leave me no other choice.

06:35.788 --> 06:39.415
Call Boston PD,
I want her arrested for kidnapping.

06:39.450 --> 06:43.043
Oh, before you do that, dear,
could you do one thing?

06:43.078 --> 06:44.347
What?

06:44.382 --> 06:47.451
Call Alan Shore. He's in the book.

06:48.473 --> 06:50.556
Why did you try to kidnap this woman?

06:50.556 --> 06:52.547
She wasn't kidnapping me.

06:52.582 --> 06:53.989
She was helping me escape.

06:53.989 --> 06:55.028
Oh, come on…

06:55.064 --> 06:55.675
Alan…

06:55.710 --> 06:57.840
A crime is being committed here.

06:57.841 --> 07:00.466
Adele is being held prisoner.

07:01.181 --> 07:02.321
Go on.

07:02.356 --> 07:05.534
Adele's been in the hospital
suffering from depression.

07:05.534 --> 07:08.655
Her son died recently,
and it really devastated her.

07:08.677 --> 07:11.374
Last week, they took her out of the hospital,

07:11.374 --> 07:15.401
and they brought her here to this
so-called “Assisted Living Center”.

07:15.401 --> 07:17.614
They put her on antidepressants.

07:17.649 --> 07:19.403
She started feeling better,

07:19.438 --> 07:20.972
and she asked when she could go home.

07:20.972 --> 07:23.860
That's when she found out
the court had assigned

07:23.895 --> 07:26.713
a conservator to be in charge of her estate.

07:26.748 --> 07:29.738
Donald Wharton…
a man she'd never even heard of.

07:29.773 --> 07:32.140
He has my power of attorney.

07:32.175 --> 07:36.378
He has control of my bank accounts,
of my property.

07:36.413 --> 07:38.286
He… he's selling off my assets.

07:38.321 --> 07:42.576
And he is spending all of my money
without my permission.

07:43.277 --> 07:46.971
Adele… Do you have any family?

07:48.576 --> 07:50.666
Not since my son passed away.

07:50.701 --> 07:52.125
Catherine…

07:52.160 --> 07:54.769
If you knew this injustice
was being done to Adele,

07:54.769 --> 07:58.007
why didn't you simply call me
before you attempted to kidnap her?

07:58.007 --> 08:02.843
Well, dear, you… you'd helped me out
on those two convenience store robberies,

08:02.878 --> 08:05.113
not to mention the murder.

08:05.148 --> 08:08.509
I didn't want to think
I was becoming a bother.

08:14.003 --> 08:17.658
So… one has only to fill out a few forms,

08:17.693 --> 08:19.751
and is then fully licensed by the state?

08:19.751 --> 08:23.035
It's that easy.  Now many conservators
are perfectly qualified,

08:23.035 --> 08:25.448
but the lesser ones are
akin to the jackal.

08:25.448 --> 08:28.223
They sniff around hospital corridors,

08:28.258 --> 08:31.671
hunting for senior citizens
with no family ties.

08:31.706 --> 08:32.861
When they corner one,

08:32.861 --> 08:35.147
the conservator goes before a judge
with an emergency motion,

08:35.147 --> 08:38.679
the judge, overburdened with caseloads,
quickly grants them a power of attorney,

08:38.679 --> 08:41.227
and suddenly, they sink their teeth
into that senior's life.

08:41.227 --> 08:45.316
They seize their assess, strip away
all their decision making powers,

08:45.316 --> 08:50.801
then run up charges, feeding off the estates
until the bones have been picked clean.

08:50.836 --> 08:53.797
Wow. Aren't people grand?

08:54.629 --> 08:56.138
Alan, what are you eating?

08:56.138 --> 08:59.901
Jamaican Ackee. It tastes like
scrambled eggs if you cook it.

08:59.936 --> 09:01.629
No, thanks.

09:02.432 --> 09:04.792
How do you want to proceed
with Adele's conservator?

09:04.792 --> 09:06.339
Mr Wharton?

09:06.374 --> 09:09.982
A visit to his den would be a good start.

09:10.766 --> 09:12.336
Hmm, why not?

09:12.371 --> 09:17.672
Avoid the pink parts. They've been
known to cause vomiting or… death.

09:26.331 --> 09:28.827
The first thing we should talk about
is Paul Lewiston.

09:28.827 --> 09:30.899
Let's wait until he gets here.

09:30.934 --> 09:32.863
Well, that's the point.
He's not getting here.

09:32.863 --> 09:35.882
His schedule's been a bit shaky since
he's taken custody of his granddaughter.

09:35.882 --> 09:36.699
Granddaughter?

09:36.699 --> 09:38.135
Fiona, his daughter Rachel's in…

09:38.135 --> 09:39.797
Oh, right, right, right. The druggie.

09:39.797 --> 09:40.853
She's not a druggie.

09:40.853 --> 09:43.070
She has an addiction for which
she's receiving treatment.

09:43.070 --> 09:47.647
We don't need Paul.  The hell with it.
I'll take care of this.  What's on his plate?

09:47.647 --> 09:52.189
Uh, to start with, Paul has final interviews
for summer associate candidates.

09:52.189 --> 09:53.455
Boring. Next.

09:53.490 --> 09:55.752
Uh, it's almost the first of the month.

09:55.752 --> 09:57.632
Someone needs to meet
with the building manager.

09:57.632 --> 09:58.715
I'll take that.

09:58.750 --> 10:01.692
And Sam Wolfson wanted
some time this week.

10:01.727 --> 10:04.599
Oh, Sam and I go way back.
I'll cover Sam.

10:04.634 --> 10:07.742
Well, folks, there you are.
You see? Problem solved.

10:07.742 --> 10:11.481
Denny Crane…
Hands on management.

10:14.501 --> 10:16.315
Where's Paul?

10:16.350 --> 10:18.129
Oh, dear God.

10:20.029 --> 10:23.490
My absence at this morning's
partnership meeting was unavoidable.

10:23.490 --> 10:25.556
I had to take Fiona to the pediatrician.

10:25.556 --> 10:27.276
Perfectly understandable, Paul.

10:27.276 --> 10:31.206
We're just curious when you'll be
returning to work full-time.

10:32.398 --> 10:35.940
Shirley, I have recently become
the single parent

10:35.975 --> 10:39.111
to a 3-year-old child who has
no one but me to depend on.

10:39.111 --> 10:40.428
Paul, I know it's hard.

10:40.428 --> 10:42.213
No, it's not about being hard.

10:42.213 --> 10:45.389
It's that my priorities are different now.

10:45.424 --> 10:50.735
And suddenly, this firm
doesn't seem so important.

10:50.770 --> 10:52.927
Denny Crane…
master of the house.

10:52.962 --> 10:54.503
Hello, Denny. How are things?

10:54.503 --> 10:57.626
Couldn't be better. Paul, I heard
about your druggie daughter.

10:57.626 --> 10:59.948
I've got things under control now.

10:59.983 --> 11:02.270
Why don't you take the time you need?

11:02.305 --> 11:05.472
Thank you. I intend to.

11:05.507 --> 11:07.195
Shirley.

11:08.832 --> 11:10.973
“Druggie daughter?”

11:11.008 --> 11:12.321
What?

11:12.356 --> 11:14.661
We covered the increased security
at the front desk,

11:14.661 --> 11:17.681
and you're going to repair
the water damage on the 14th floor.

11:17.681 --> 11:20.843
Da, I take care of Friday if good.

11:20.878 --> 11:22.122
Very good.

11:23.285 --> 11:27.744
What went smoothly.
So I guess I'll see you next month.

11:28.034 --> 11:29.536
So…

11:36.838 --> 11:37.979
I'm forgetting something.

11:37.979 --> 11:39.285
Yeah.

11:39.308 --> 11:40.578
Right. Here's the thing…

11:40.578 --> 11:43.295
I don't know what it is I'm forgetting.

11:43.330 --> 11:45.561
E… envelope.

11:50.696 --> 11:52.072
Are you asking me for a bribe?

11:52.072 --> 11:54.708
No! No, no, no, no.

12:18.145 --> 12:20.318
Cretins.

12:30.843 --> 12:31.967
So…

12:32.356 --> 12:34.049
Are you gonna tell me?

12:35.418 --> 12:36.992
Yes, you're zipped.

12:37.027 --> 12:39.352
That's not what I meant.

12:39.387 --> 12:40.386
Denny, do you mind?

12:40.386 --> 12:41.387
Shirley, you're my girl.

12:41.387 --> 12:44.685
I rarely look at people's faces
other than my own,

12:44.720 --> 12:47.691
but your pallor was
telling me something.

12:47.726 --> 12:49.362
Man trouble?

12:53.390 --> 12:55.132
It's Ivan.

12:55.167 --> 12:57.580
He won't stop until he gets
what he wants.

12:57.580 --> 12:59.076
Right now what he wants is me,

12:59.076 --> 13:03.145
and… for once,
I don't trust myself with him.

13:03.181 --> 13:06.800
So… why not have an affair with him
and get it over with?

13:06.835 --> 13:09.228
And what about his sweet, young wife?

13:09.263 --> 13:11.008
Not to mention my own morals.

13:11.043 --> 13:12.434
Morals.

13:12.469 --> 13:17.308
Invented by the power elite to keep
the «οἱ πολλοί» from enjoying themselves.

13:17.343 --> 13:19.942
As for the wife, either she won't find out

13:19.977 --> 13:22.835
and you'll be fine,
or she will and she'll learn.

13:22.835 --> 13:24.722
If he's gonna have an affair with someone,

13:24.722 --> 13:26.873
why not be part of the fun?

13:27.368 --> 13:30.188
Maybe you should write fortune cookies.

13:30.220 --> 13:32.601
And maybe you…

13:32.633 --> 13:35.906
should fantasize about him
with someone else.

13:36.417 --> 13:37.135
Good-bye, Denny.

13:37.135 --> 13:39.808
Was that too subtle? I meant me.

13:53.704 --> 13:56.458
Wait out here, Adele. I'll just be a minute.

13:56.493 --> 13:59.553
Catherine, to what do I owe
this pleasant surprise?

13:59.571 --> 14:01.578
I heard you were going
to see Wharton today.

14:01.578 --> 14:02.744
I'm on my way.

14:02.745 --> 14:07.559
I just wanna warn you, don't be fooled
by his silly, cherubic face.

14:07.594 --> 14:11.404
I mean, he fools judges,
he fools hospital administrators…

14:11.439 --> 14:13.551
anyone he needs to so he can get his hands

14:13.551 --> 14:15.629
on folk like Adele and her pocketbook.

14:15.629 --> 14:17.004
He's a bad man, Alan.

14:17.038 --> 14:18.415
I'm hardly ever fooled.

14:18.415 --> 14:20.019
Oh, come on.

14:20.054 --> 14:23.102
The first time you met me,
I'm sure you had no idea

14:23.102 --> 14:26.103
I'd be capable of killing a man
with a frying pan.

14:26.117 --> 14:27.250
Catherine, when I met you,

14:27.250 --> 14:29.697
I was sure you could accomplish
anything you set your mind to,

14:29.697 --> 14:31.350
and you've yet to disappoint.

14:31.350 --> 14:35.107
Just so you know, I've asked Jesus
not to forgive him.

14:35.142 --> 14:38.530
I think Adele has a very good friend.

14:38.820 --> 14:42.065
Oh, Adele and I are old.  If we don't
stick up for each other, who will?

14:42.065 --> 14:43.697
Hello, Adele.

14:44.126 --> 14:46.482
Clifford, regarding the collection…

14:46.516 --> 14:48.837
when one is faced with a daunting loss,

14:48.837 --> 14:52.219
one tries to hold tightly
to something tangible.

14:52.254 --> 14:55.564
As your attorney and as someone
who's been there,

14:55.600 --> 14:58.748
divorce can play some very nasty tricks
on your psyche.

14:58.748 --> 15:01.862
So you're asking, is it conceivable
I can't let Natalie go?

15:01.862 --> 15:05.383
I'm putting it out there as a possibility.

15:06.403 --> 15:08.353
Given the fact she'd rather spend more time

15:08.353 --> 15:11.529
chairing the women's studies department
than be with me,

15:11.529 --> 15:14.356
and that she's the one
that asked for the divorce?

15:14.356 --> 15:16.064
Something like that.

15:16.099 --> 15:17.738
The answer is still no.

15:17.773 --> 15:21.327
Shirley, this is my vision.
It's not just some collection of smut,

15:21.327 --> 15:23.385
it's an actual window into our history,

15:23.385 --> 15:26.490
a look at how we perceive
ourselves and our society

15:26.525 --> 15:30.333
through a lens of our most primary urges.

15:30.368 --> 15:35.080
I even had this artist's rendering done
for a museum I'd like to start.

15:36.940 --> 15:40.983
“Professor Clifford Cabot's Cabinet
of Sexual Curiosities”.

15:41.018 --> 15:43.418
Now that's just to get them in the door.

15:43.965 --> 15:45.566
I'm beginning to get the idea.

15:45.566 --> 15:48.469
and I think a judge might as well, however…

15:48.504 --> 15:52.275
I still feel if you don't give a little,

15:52.309 --> 15:55.842
you'll stand to lose a lot.

15:56.447 --> 15:59.189
Sorry about the mess.
It's been busy lately.

15:59.224 --> 16:00.654
I can imagine.

16:01.219 --> 16:05.822
Oh, look, Denise. When's the last time
you saw a TV tray?

16:05.857 --> 16:08.991
Suddenly I feel like watching “Bonanza”.

16:09.026 --> 16:11.835
So you want to talk about Adele?

16:11.870 --> 16:14.283
Yes, Adele tells us that
you have moved her into

16:14.283 --> 16:17.293
an assisted living facility
and are selling off her assets.

16:17.293 --> 16:19.044
Well, it's the only way
to pay for the place.

16:19.044 --> 16:20.570
They're so damn expensive.

16:20.570 --> 16:22.027
Someone should look into that.

16:22.027 --> 16:24.419
An alternative would be
to take her out of the facility

16:24.419 --> 16:27.401
and move her back home.
Just a thought.

16:27.436 --> 16:30.383
Oh, I know Adele does not want
to be there.

16:30.419 --> 16:32.711
She's fighting me on that one.

16:33.444 --> 16:35.416
Mr Wharton, we've met with Adele.

16:35.416 --> 16:38.736
And while she may have had trouble
when she first arrived at the hospital,

16:38.736 --> 16:43.213
she has since recovered and is ready
to move on with her life.

16:43.248 --> 16:47.651
And as her attorneys, we'd like to help you
move on with certain things as well.

16:47.651 --> 16:49.899
We've gotten rid of the trouble
of court nonsense…

16:49.899 --> 16:52.115
Notary public, standing in line
at the post office…

16:52.115 --> 16:54.377
You have only to sign this release,

16:54.412 --> 16:56.882
and we will relieve you
of one of the burdens

16:56.882 --> 17:00.638
of your already overburdened workload.

17:00.975 --> 17:02.636
She got to you, didn't she?

17:02.671 --> 17:03.353
I beg your pardon?

17:03.353 --> 17:06.405
Adele. She's very good with strangers.

17:06.440 --> 17:08.240
Adele has clinical depression.

17:08.247 --> 17:10.618
You probably saw her on a good day.

17:10.654 --> 17:14.989
She has bouts of forgetfulness,
poor judgment, difficulty concentrating.

17:15.023 --> 17:19.160
If I were to let her go,
as an appointee of the court,

17:19.194 --> 17:23.858
and more importantly, as one
of the only people who cares about her,

17:23.894 --> 17:26.781
I would be completely remiss.

17:30.118 --> 17:33.241
Mr Wharton, what color are Adele's eyes?

17:33.276 --> 17:35.658
Uh… blue.

17:35.693 --> 17:38.005
They're brown.

17:38.040 --> 17:40.391
What was her son's name?

17:40.680 --> 17:42.522
Jonathan.

17:43.612 --> 17:46.629
Mr Wharton, as someone
who cares about Adele

17:46.664 --> 17:49.869
and is supposed to be caring for Adele,

17:49.904 --> 17:53.169
you seem to be very forgetful yourself.

17:53.204 --> 17:56.434
Please don't forget your court date.

18:15.293 --> 18:16.783
Denny.

18:19.735 --> 18:20.600
You're panting.

18:20.600 --> 18:21.912
Yes.

18:21.947 --> 18:24.058
Because of me?

18:24.059 --> 18:26.031
Because of you.

18:26.066 --> 18:27.969
Lock the door.

18:28.004 --> 18:31.734
Because of you… Paul didn't keep
his meeting with the building manager

18:31.734 --> 18:33.105
and Brad stiffed him.

18:33.140 --> 18:35.406
Now we don't have elevator service
before 7:00am,

18:35.406 --> 18:38.186
and I had to walk up 14 flights
of stairs. Didn't you?

18:38.186 --> 18:41.136
I climb the stairs every morning.
The elevator's for democrats.

18:41.136 --> 18:42.969
Lock the door.

18:43.564 --> 18:45.712
My nipple's hard.

18:45.747 --> 18:48.441
While I appreciate the update
on your vestigial teat,

18:48.441 --> 18:50.045
you're not horny, you're freezing.

18:50.045 --> 18:51.805
Apparently the heat doesn't go on
in the building

18:51.805 --> 18:56.211
before 7:00am because Paul didn't keep
his special agreement with the building.

18:56.211 --> 18:58.442
You're not gonna lock the door,
are you?

18:58.442 --> 19:00.639
Denny, you have gotta
convince Paul to stay.

19:00.639 --> 19:03.015
Me? Never happen.

19:03.049 --> 19:06.869
The reason you, me, Alan
and the rest of us get to go to court

19:06.904 --> 19:10.723
and yell “Objection” and sue people
and make witnesses cry is Paul.

19:10.723 --> 19:12.729
Paul makes the elevators run.

19:12.764 --> 19:16.681
He supervises the associates,
he double-checks the billables.

19:16.716 --> 19:19.683
Well, let me tell you, Shirley,

19:19.933 --> 19:22.544
what makes this place run…

19:22.578 --> 19:24.621
money. And I bring it in.

19:24.656 --> 19:26.874
You bring it in, Denny.

19:26.910 --> 19:29.060
But Paul puts it to work.

19:29.095 --> 19:32.820
Shirley… A supermarket doesn't close
'cause the cashier quit.

19:32.855 --> 19:34.330
Yes, it does, Denny.

19:34.366 --> 19:37.964
Otherwise people would just
walk out with the food.

19:44.572 --> 19:45.776
Good news.

19:45.811 --> 19:48.198
My client, in the spirit of cooperation,

19:48.198 --> 19:52.180
has made what I consider
an amicable and generous offer.

19:52.935 --> 19:56.700
Natalie is willing to give up
the entire erotica collection…

19:56.735 --> 19:59.310
book, magazines, paintings, photos…

19:59.345 --> 20:04.127
a collection which includes
five first edition copies of “The Pearl”.

20:04.162 --> 20:06.948
Which I'm guessing is not
a biography of Earl Monroe.

20:06.948 --> 20:08.039
Hardly.

20:08.074 --> 20:12.841
The full title is,“The Pearl: a journal
of facetiae and voluptuous reading”.

20:12.876 --> 20:16.821
It was first published in London
by the society of vice in 1879.

20:16.856 --> 20:20.014
The original, unbound periodicals
are exceedingly rare.

20:20.014 --> 20:23.936
And they alone are worth more than
the entire rest of the collection put together.

20:23.936 --> 20:25.663
So we understand what we're talking about,

20:25.663 --> 20:26.834
perhaps I could read a passage.

20:26.834 --> 20:27.582
Ivan, that wouldn't…

20:27.582 --> 20:31.391
“I poured into her ears
a tale of burning love.

20:31.426 --> 20:35.165
Finding that she made no resistance,
I pressed her to my bosom.

20:35.165 --> 20:39.239
I undressed her till she stood
in perfect nudity.

20:39.274 --> 20:45.278
I led her to the bedside, she lay back,
I sank to my knees,

20:45.313 --> 20:50.027
and then with eagerness and tenderness, I…”

20:51.336 --> 20:53.444
Well, you get the idea.

20:53.480 --> 20:56.012
As cheesy as that was, I do.

20:56.047 --> 20:57.993
Well, that being said,

20:58.028 --> 21:01.403
Natalie is willing to give up the collection
except for one small item

21:01.403 --> 21:03.468
that she currently has in her possession.

21:03.468 --> 21:04.607
Which item?

21:04.642 --> 21:06.197
Something called the “hysteria machine”.

21:06.197 --> 21:07.457
The hysteria machine?

21:07.470 --> 21:08.299
That Harridan!

21:08.299 --> 21:09.966
What the hell is a hysteria machine?

21:09.966 --> 21:12.006
The premier piece of the entire collection.

21:12.006 --> 21:13.589
Why didn't I see this coming?

21:13.589 --> 21:15.883
Forget the house, forget the pewter.

21:15.918 --> 21:18.177
She wants to play dirty, so be it.

21:19.306 --> 21:22.265
Ivan, we're going to court.

21:22.728 --> 21:24.723
Sounds like a date.

21:32.116 --> 21:34.564
Your honor, since he became
Mrs Freeman's conservator,

21:34.564 --> 21:38.504
Mr Wharton has placed Mrs Freeman
in a convalescent home against her will,

21:38.504 --> 21:41.295
has taken control of all her credit cards.

21:41.330 --> 21:44.086
He has charged exorbitant fees
to the estate.

21:44.121 --> 21:46.399
To pay her $90 electric bill,

21:46.434 --> 21:48.642
he charged the estate $150.

21:48.677 --> 21:54.001
He charged $170 to bring her
less than $50 worth of groceries.

21:54.036 --> 21:56.589
Your honor, these are legitimate expenses.

21:56.624 --> 21:59.108
The truth is, if everyone did their job,

21:59.143 --> 22:02.021
helped out with their family,
their friends, their neighbors,

22:02.021 --> 22:04.226
it would render my job unnecessary.

22:04.261 --> 22:05.332
But we don't.

22:05.367 --> 22:09.063
We, as a society, don't like to take
care of the old and the weak.

22:09.063 --> 22:12.271
It's a difficult, heart wrenching affair.

22:12.306 --> 22:15.613
Well, I stood up and am doing it.

22:15.648 --> 22:20.918
I have an affidavit from the admitting nurse
at the hospital where Adele was first taken.

22:20.918 --> 22:25.662
She says Adele was confused, disoriented
and apparently hadn't eaten in several days.

22:25.662 --> 22:30.372
A state any of us might be in after the death
of our last surviving family member.

22:30.372 --> 22:33.840
I have an affidavit from
The Cottonwood Assisted Living Home,

22:33.840 --> 22:37.362
which states Mrs Freeman
is lucid and rational.

22:37.397 --> 22:40.885
She's lucid because
she's well taken care of.

22:40.920 --> 22:42.814
Mr Wharton makes a point.

22:42.849 --> 22:46.270
Mrs Freeman is 83 and has no family.

22:46.305 --> 22:49.836
What if she goes off her medication?
Suppose she takes a fall?

22:49.836 --> 22:53.207
Your honor, if that's a concern,
I can arrange for her to live with a friend.

22:53.207 --> 22:57.243
A friend, especially a mature friend,

22:57.278 --> 23:00.925
is not the same as a family member
or a legal conservator.

23:00.960 --> 23:03.364
–Your Honor, I…
–I've heard enough from both sides.

23:03.364 --> 23:07.174
I'm assigning a court appointed psychiatrist
to examine you, Mrs Freeman.

23:07.174 --> 23:11.507
Until I have evidence that
you are entirely self-sufficient,

23:11.542 --> 23:14.798
you will remain a ward of Mr Wharton.

23:14.833 --> 23:18.003
We will reconvene in six weeks
after the examination.

23:18.003 --> 23:19.510
Six weeks?

23:19.545 --> 23:22.540
Your Honor, for Mrs Freeman,
that is a lifetime.

23:22.575 --> 23:26.907
And in the court system,
it's practically the speed of light.

23:27.389 --> 23:29.054
We're adjourned.

23:31.168 --> 23:33.503
It was actually used as a medical device.

23:33.503 --> 23:38.005
During the Victorian Era, there was
an inability or an unwillingness of society

23:38.005 --> 23:39.847
to comprehend female sexual desire,

23:39.847 --> 23:43.729
so this desire was misinterpreted
as “an illness”.

23:43.764 --> 23:45.748
It doesn't seem to be working.

23:45.783 --> 23:47.901
Well, it takes a minute or two
to get its steam up.

23:47.901 --> 23:49.881
In the meantime, professor Cabot,

23:49.892 --> 23:52.496
could you tell us how
the hysteria machine works?

23:52.496 --> 23:56.275
Women frequently complained
of symptoms such as nervousness, uh,

23:56.275 --> 24:00.020
heaviness in the abdomen, vaginal
lubrication, insomnia and so on.

24:00.020 --> 24:02.482
Doctors referred to these symptoms
as hysteria,

24:02.482 --> 24:06.122
but of course, they're actually
signs of sexual arousal.

24:06.156 --> 24:09.727
Before the invention of this machine,
a doctor would, uh,

24:09.762 --> 24:14.643
massage a woman until she reached a
climactic “paroxysm”, as they called it.

24:14.678 --> 24:18.605
I should've listened to my mother.
She always wanted me to be a doctor.

24:18.605 --> 24:20.549
And how did this machine
come into being?

24:20.549 --> 24:25.949
A doctor invented it because,
well… his arm got tired.

24:26.629 --> 24:30.222
Ah, the steam is up,
and it's ready to go.

24:31.782 --> 24:32.981
Oh, my God.

24:33.016 --> 24:34.259
It's amazing, isn't it?

24:34.259 --> 24:38.975
And I haven't even put the attachments
on yet, which go right there.

24:40.798 --> 24:42.556
Oh, my God!

24:42.591 --> 24:44.880
It's the only working one of its kind
in the world.

24:44.880 --> 24:47.847
It's unique and valuable and irreplaceable.

24:47.882 --> 24:50.899
Would you, uh, shut it off, please?

24:55.356 --> 25:00.149
Sorry, your Honor. A steam engine
doesn't just shut off right away.

25:05.317 --> 25:09.995
Mr Wharton, unfortunately, what
may seem like a small victory is

25:10.031 --> 25:13.917
really just postponing the inevitable.
We will prevail,

25:13.952 --> 25:17.186
and since I know you're anxious
to get home and rake your shag carpet,

25:17.186 --> 25:19.569
why don't you just let this one go?

25:19.605 --> 25:21.898
Well, mostly because I'm mad.

25:21.933 --> 25:24.644
And for Adele's sake, I'm willing
to stay in this for the long haul.

25:24.644 --> 25:27.298
I'll hire my own high priced attorneys
at $500 an hour.

25:27.298 --> 25:29.918
And you know where that money
comes from, don't you?

25:29.918 --> 25:31.461
Adele's bank account.

25:31.496 --> 25:35.246
That's what it's there for…
To insure the well being of my client.

25:35.246 --> 25:41.895
But don't worry, I'll eventually stop
battling you once all the money's run out.

25:55.094 --> 26:00.416
Professor Cabot, don't you intend,
eventually, to donate this collection,

26:00.452 --> 26:05.741
including the hysteria machine to a museum,
a place where everyone could…

26:05.776 --> 26:07.233
get some pleasure from it?

26:07.233 --> 26:09.784
Objection, your Honor.
Leading the witness.

26:09.784 --> 26:12.230
Sustained. The witness will not answer.

26:12.265 --> 26:16.234
But I got the point anyway.
Please take a seat.

26:16.268 --> 26:21.707
It seems to me that professor Clifford Cabot's
motivation for wanting the machine

26:21.742 --> 26:27.213
would serve a greater good than
your more… localized motivations.

26:27.248 --> 26:32.650
I'm inclined to award the machine
to professor Clifford Cabot.

26:32.685 --> 26:37.117
Bring it and an inventory of the rest
of the collection into court this afternoon,

26:37.117 --> 26:40.069
and then I'll decide who gets what.

26:47.985 --> 26:51.869
Alan… He's selling her house.

26:57.078 --> 26:58.849
That's my living room,

26:58.884 --> 27:01.393
my son Jonathan's bedroom,

27:01.428 --> 27:03.868
my kitchen, my bathroom.

27:03.903 --> 27:08.931
My house is a “Charming
3–bedroom with potential.”

27:08.966 --> 27:09.964
What's going on?

27:09.998 --> 27:12.646
Mr Wharton is even more rancid
than I had imagined.

27:12.646 --> 27:15.381
He's attempting to sell Adele's home.

27:15.416 --> 27:18.383
Apparently, this isn't the first time
Mr Wharton has done this.

27:18.383 --> 27:23.261
According to a title search, he has sold
11 houses belonging to his wards.

27:23.296 --> 27:26.022
And get this, the house
he's living in right now

27:26.022 --> 27:28.874
belonged to another one
of his wards who happened to

27:28.874 --> 27:31.462
pass away in her sleep.

27:31.496 --> 27:33.776
This man is pure evil.

27:33.810 --> 27:38.824
Alan, you have gotta get that creative
brain of yours to work and stop him.

27:38.859 --> 27:40.389
Yes, I do.

27:43.741 --> 27:44.376
Stolen?

27:44.411 --> 27:45.556
Right out of her car.

27:45.556 --> 27:46.382
Oh, no.

27:46.418 --> 27:47.326
It's all she had.

27:47.326 --> 27:48.991
Please, this is ludicrous.

27:49.026 --> 27:52.530
I mean, obviously Mrs Cabot doesn't want
to surrender the hysteria machine,

27:52.530 --> 27:55.531
and she's hiding it from her husband
for her own personal reasons.

27:55.531 --> 27:57.032
That's a shocking accusation.

27:57.032 --> 27:59.122
You know, you're right.
You don't play fair.

27:59.122 --> 28:00.414
What can I say?

28:00.449 --> 28:03.793
Your Honor, my client recognizes
that the news is causing distress

28:03.793 --> 28:07.783
to professor Cabot, and is therefore willing
to pay her half of the appraised value.

28:07.783 --> 28:12.348
Nonsense. The item in question was
in Mrs Cabot's care and control.

28:12.383 --> 28:17.710
Clearly, this machine
is a precious item… to him.

28:17.745 --> 28:21.621
I am therefore ordering you pay
the full cost of the machine,

28:21.656 --> 28:24.380
plus punitive damages
I will determine at a later date.

28:24.380 --> 28:27.945
Your Honor, this is unacceptable.
Obviously, she still has the machine.

28:27.945 --> 28:30.794
If it turns up, we will address
the matter later.

28:30.794 --> 28:34.203
But until such time, this ruling stands.

28:34.424 --> 28:35.398
You lying bitch.

28:35.432 --> 28:36.374
Don't threaten me.

28:36.374 --> 28:37.344
You think this is over?

28:37.344 --> 28:38.025
The judge ruled.

28:38.025 --> 28:38.695
It's not over.

28:38.695 --> 28:39.917
People!

28:40.560 --> 28:43.455
Clifford, we need to push forward with this.

28:43.490 --> 28:45.416
If the hysteria machine was stolen,

28:45.416 --> 28:48.176
you need to take the necessary
and appropriate action.

28:48.176 --> 28:51.297
And as co-owner, you will file a police report,

28:51.333 --> 28:54.320
and you will file a claim
with your insurance company.

28:54.320 --> 28:57.031
There'll be an investigation.
You'll have to open up your house.

28:57.031 --> 28:59.662
If you give a false statement to the police

28:59.697 --> 29:02.293
or, worse these days,
the insurance company,

29:02.293 --> 29:05.489
you'll be charged with fraud and prosecuted
to the full extent of the law.

29:05.489 --> 29:08.651
And from my experiences, the DA's office
takes these crimes seriously

29:08.651 --> 29:10.451
and often pushes for jail time,

29:10.451 --> 29:13.298
where you'll be able to do
lots of women's studies.

29:13.298 --> 29:15.121
Shirley.

29:15.156 --> 29:17.505
Now, that's not nice.

29:17.540 --> 29:19.553
Are we being nice now?

29:30.965 --> 29:33.131
<i>This is for $4,000, Bob.</i>

29:33.166 --> 29:38.547
<i>A provost is a high-ranking officer
commonly found at what type of institution?</i>

29:38.582 --> 29:42.548
<i>Museum…, hospital, university, bank.</i>

29:42.583 --> 29:44.901
It's university, you idiot.

29:44.936 --> 29:46.291
<i>University.</i>

29:46.549 --> 29:47.519
<i>Final answer?</i>

29:47.519 --> 29:48.420
<i>Final.</i>

29:48.904 --> 29:51.538
<i>Yes, sir. You got it again, Bob.</i>

29:57.406 --> 30:00.349
Help! Help!

30:00.384 --> 30:03.164
Oh, God! Oh, God!

30:03.199 --> 30:07.587
Help! Help!

30:18.537 --> 30:21.890
Yoo-hoo, anybody home?

30:23.721 --> 30:25.445
Mr Wharton.

30:28.219 --> 30:30.536
Oh, my goodness.

30:30.571 --> 30:32.819
This is dreadful.

30:32.854 --> 30:36.482
Look at you.
You've been assaulted and robbed.

30:36.517 --> 30:38.448
Oh, the world we live in.

30:38.483 --> 30:42.200
Who on earth would do
something such as this?

30:44.367 --> 30:46.922
Oh, of course. You can't speak.

30:46.957 --> 30:49.477
I'll get you a pad and a pencil.

30:49.762 --> 30:52.585
No, that's no good.
Your hands are tied. My God.

30:52.585 --> 30:57.051
You must have been left here
for what, over an hour?

30:57.086 --> 31:01.517
It must feel awful to be left
alone and vulnerable.

31:02.345 --> 31:07.689
Well, apparently, they made off
with nothing more than
some dingy old file boxes,

31:07.724 --> 31:10.226
which could only contain records,
I would imagine.

31:10.226 --> 31:11.469
How stupid are they?

31:11.504 --> 31:13.772
I mean, what could they possibly hope
to get for that?

31:13.772 --> 31:16.441
Anyway, I'm glad it's over.

31:16.816 --> 31:19.857
Let's just pray it never happens again

31:19.893 --> 31:24.685
and again and… again. Oh.

31:24.720 --> 31:29.072
Also, obviously, you're in no shape
to handle your court appointed duties,

31:29.072 --> 31:31.360
particularly with regard to Adele.
Not to worry.

31:31.360 --> 31:38.691
I just happen to have with me that…
release form from the other day.

31:38.726 --> 31:44.006
Now maybe there's just
enough give here…

31:44.687 --> 31:47.673
to let you sign it.

31:47.708 --> 31:51.423
There's that. Here you go.

31:52.867 --> 31:55.438
Wonderful.

31:57.287 --> 32:03.199
You know, now that this experience
has brought us closer,

32:03.234 --> 32:06.103
I feel I can say this.

32:06.512 --> 32:10.118
Sometimes these events
are just what one needs

32:10.153 --> 32:12.595
to shake things up a bit, make a change.

32:12.630 --> 32:16.488
New job, new direction, new ideas…
just a thought.

32:16.523 --> 32:20.346
I'm thinking now would be
a perfect time to start.

32:21.450 --> 32:23.790
Yes, well, this is much better already.

32:23.803 --> 32:27.235
I feel that foreboding
sense of danger fading.

32:27.270 --> 32:30.632
Still, best to stay alert,
on the right path.

32:30.667 --> 32:34.009
Because you never know when
this kind of thing might happen again.

32:34.009 --> 32:36.865
You only know that it will.

32:53.252 --> 32:54.634
Hey.

32:55.895 --> 32:57.965
Hey, hey.

33:03.265 --> 33:06.125
You didn't actually file a police report?

33:06.160 --> 33:08.684
And an insurance claim.

33:10.186 --> 33:11.844
Shirley…

33:12.325 --> 33:17.185
If, God forbid, the guy who stole this
feels remorse and returns it to my client,

33:17.216 --> 33:19.120
she could end up going to jail.

33:19.155 --> 33:23.733
It's a tribute to the risks one is willing
to take for some momentary pleasure.

33:23.733 --> 33:26.573
Which proves my point, by the way.

33:26.608 --> 33:29.651
It's not just me, it's all of us.

33:29.686 --> 33:32.659
We are all merely sexual animals.

33:32.694 --> 33:36.892
And Shirley, as crude
as you might think me at times,

33:36.927 --> 33:41.090
at least I put myself out there
and act on my instincts.

33:41.125 --> 33:43.499
You must at least admire me for that.

33:43.534 --> 33:46.134
I more than admire you,
Ivan, and you know it.

33:46.134 --> 33:48.665
You have a wife who adores you
and who you love…

33:48.665 --> 33:52.313
probably more than you're willing
to admit… and for her sake,

33:52.313 --> 33:58.013
if not more importantly for your own,
you need to grow up.

34:04.938 --> 34:06.924
I love you, Shirley.

34:10.841 --> 34:13.250
I love you, too.

34:31.934 --> 34:32.960
Sam.

34:33.360 --> 34:34.737
Denny Crane.

34:34.772 --> 34:36.304
Good to see you.

34:36.339 --> 34:37.802
Oh, look at you.

34:37.837 --> 34:38.601
How's Evenly?

34:38.601 --> 34:39.295
She's well.

34:39.297 --> 34:41.422
She's very well. Thanks for asking.

34:41.458 --> 34:43.550
How is the fishing going this season?

34:43.550 --> 34:45.408
In the water or in the bedroom?

34:49.347 --> 34:53.177
Well… what can we do for you?

34:53.212 --> 34:55.159
Shouldn't we wait for Paul Lewiston?

34:55.159 --> 34:58.353
Paul's… dialing things back a little right now.

34:58.388 --> 35:00.816
Oh, well…

35:00.851 --> 35:04.337
I'm considering divesting from some of
my Hong Kong subsidiaries…

35:04.337 --> 35:04.779
Really?

35:04.814 --> 35:07.592
And, uh… I'm sorry.

35:07.593 --> 35:09.248
Is Paul leaving the firm?

35:09.283 --> 35:11.748
It's unclear. But the point is,

35:11.783 --> 35:15.322
I'm your point man. Always have been.

35:15.889 --> 35:17.890
Denny, we've known each other long time,

35:17.890 --> 35:21.236
so I don't take any pleasure
in being this blunt,

35:21.270 --> 35:24.581
but I love having a drink
with you, schmoozing.

35:24.616 --> 35:26.019
Right.

35:26.054 --> 35:28.513
Paul's the one I deal with.

35:28.548 --> 35:33.681
I mean, he's the expert
in Asian markets, and you…

35:34.155 --> 35:36.091
Well…

35:48.106 --> 35:49.748
This is for you.

35:51.323 --> 35:52.464
What is it?

35:52.499 --> 35:53.606
Open it.

36:00.988 --> 36:01.348
Denny…

36:01.372 --> 36:05.967
Just a simple “Thank you, oh, kind
and benevolent leader” will suffice.

36:07.490 --> 36:09.953
I can't accept this.

36:09.988 --> 36:12.281
I thought it was what you always wanted.

36:12.281 --> 36:15.663
I'm sure it's what you thought I always wanted.

36:15.698 --> 36:18.448
You trying to play hardball with me, Paul?

36:19.188 --> 36:23.708
Don't tell me this whole thing
is simply a matter of respect?

36:24.375 --> 36:26.102
Good God, it is.

36:26.137 --> 36:31.285
My mind and my priorities are exactly
where they should be right now.

36:31.320 --> 36:36.433
When Rachel gets out, I will be
back here full-time, or maybe I won't.

36:36.468 --> 36:39.471
In the meantime,
it will give you the opportunity

36:39.506 --> 36:44.971
to actually think about things
for a change.

36:46.741 --> 36:49.190
God bless us. We found it.

36:49.225 --> 36:51.797
The antique, steam-powered
woman-pleasing machine

36:51.797 --> 36:54.154
is always in the last place you look.

36:54.189 --> 36:55.298
You bet.

36:55.299 --> 36:58.136
Now my client is
more than thrilled to return it

36:58.136 --> 37:00.588
and just ask for visitation rights.

37:00.623 --> 37:03.005
However, she cannot do that from jail,

37:03.040 --> 37:07.260
and so she requests that the police
and insurance claims be withdrawn.

37:07.295 --> 37:11.481
Done. I just want to check to make sure
it's the original machine.

37:11.516 --> 37:13.184
You don't trust me.

37:14.480 --> 37:16.754
Not a bad idea.

37:38.898 --> 37:41.482
I left my wife, Shirley.

37:43.706 --> 37:45.826
Did you?

37:45.861 --> 37:48.175
About an hour ago.

37:56.402 --> 37:58.896
So what do you think?

38:00.211 --> 38:03.823
To be honest,
I'm a little afraid to think.

38:04.687 --> 38:07.571
Well, no need then.

38:07.606 --> 38:11.743
However, you know me.
I do have a question.

38:12.149 --> 38:14.617
And what would that be?

38:17.245 --> 38:21.238
Would you like to see my attachments?

38:42.239 --> 38:44.316
Denny… You're here late.

38:44.351 --> 38:46.024
I run the place.

38:46.404 --> 38:47.835
So…

38:48.566 --> 38:50.390
You and Shirley…

38:51.621 --> 38:54.281
that gives us something in common.

38:54.316 --> 38:55.824
A hell of a woman.

38:55.859 --> 38:58.016
We have something else in common.

38:58.051 --> 38:59.783
What's that?

39:00.127 --> 39:01.686
We're both…

39:01.721 --> 39:06.128
leading men.
We're like stars in our own show.

39:06.163 --> 39:09.457
Only the star doesn't have
only one leading lady.

39:09.492 --> 39:12.305
Oh, sure, sometimes,
at the end of an episode,

39:12.340 --> 39:15.097
it looks like he's settling down
with someone,

39:15.118 --> 39:17.728
but the next week, she's not there.
It's somebody else.

39:17.728 --> 39:21.327
It's a way of holding up viewer interest.

39:21.362 --> 39:23.529
You're a strange man, Denny.

39:24.057 --> 39:26.741
Strange leading man.

39:29.868 --> 39:33.169
You're not gonna hurt her, Ivan.

39:53.082 --> 39:55.371
So whose ass did you have kicked?

39:57.931 --> 40:01.090
Someone whose ass
thoroughly deserved it.

40:01.125 --> 40:02.506
Good.

40:02.541 --> 40:05.665
I can never understand
why people don't use violence

40:05.700 --> 40:08.825
more often to solve their problems.
Works every time.

40:08.825 --> 40:11.515
Actually, I'm quite disturbed by it.

40:11.550 --> 40:16.309
I had a real appetite
for Mr Wharton's fear and suffering.

40:16.344 --> 40:18.080
Is that unusual?

40:18.115 --> 40:19.815
For me? Not at all.

40:20.285 --> 40:24.281
What was unusual was how swiftly
I acted on my cravings.

40:24.316 --> 40:26.406
It was an emergency.
What else could you do?

40:26.406 --> 40:28.305
Something more clever.

40:31.854 --> 40:34.716
Equally disturbing was how easy it all was…

40:34.751 --> 40:36.949
a quick fix which required very little thought on my part.

40:36.949 --> 40:39.150
Just a phone call.

40:42.588 --> 40:45.254
I wonder what I'm turning into.

40:45.289 --> 40:47.266
Denny Crane.

40:49.622 --> 40:53.665
I think I'm still a long ways away from that.

40:54.509 --> 40:56.149
Don't you worry.

40:56.692 --> 40:58.612
You'll get there.

40:59.305 --> 41:05.918
