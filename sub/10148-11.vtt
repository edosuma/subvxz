WEBVTT

01:12.198 --> 01:13.616
How the heck did they do that?

01:18.454 --> 01:19.538
My trophies!

01:19.622 --> 01:22.458
It took me 20 years
to win those trophies.

01:22.959 --> 01:24.239
Well, someone
finally found a way

01:24.293 --> 01:25.378
to get to Coach Fitz.

01:25.461 --> 01:27.171
You know what they're saying, don't you?

01:27.255 --> 01:28.631
It's the work of the ghost,

01:28.714 --> 01:30.943
just like everything else
that's been happening around here.

01:30.967 --> 01:31.967
Ghost?

01:32.635 --> 01:34.470
The ghost of Garrison Jacobs.

01:34.553 --> 01:36.639
The kid who was killed
when they built the east wing.

01:36.722 --> 01:39.392
Where have you been
the last two weeks? In a cave?

01:39.892 --> 01:41.018
Uh...

01:44.021 --> 01:45.481
Isn't that just typical?

01:45.564 --> 01:47.275
A few strange, unexplainable events,

01:47.358 --> 01:49.485
and right away people start
talking poltergeist.

01:49.860 --> 01:52.321
How else do you explain
the mangled lounge furniture?

01:52.405 --> 01:53.698
And the shop teacher's hair?

01:53.990 --> 01:54.990
The wind.

02:00.746 --> 02:02.873
Well, a lot of people believe
it was Garrison,

02:02.957 --> 02:04.417
come back from the dead to haunt us.

02:07.169 --> 02:08.212
That's him?

02:08.504 --> 02:09.588
Ooh la la.

02:11.632 --> 02:15.219
Top athlete in three sports.
Lead guitarist in a band.

02:15.553 --> 02:18.222
Not to mention drop-dead gorgeous.

02:18.306 --> 02:20.182
He can haunt my castle anytime.

02:20.266 --> 02:21.266
Yeah.

02:37.491 --> 02:38.743
Should we turn on the lights?

02:39.118 --> 02:41.537
No. A seance works better in the dark.

02:41.829 --> 02:42.913
How do you know that?

02:44.999 --> 02:47.877
Okay, I don't know,
but it's creepier that way.

02:52.381 --> 02:55.885
Hear us, Garrison Jacobs.
We feel your presence.

02:55.968 --> 02:58.095
Hear us and speak to us.

03:02.725 --> 03:05.227
What are you primas doing
in my gym at this hour?

03:05.561 --> 03:07.229
We're having a seance, Nelson.

03:07.605 --> 03:08.898
Not for the stiff.

03:09.190 --> 03:11.192
What do you need to contact
a dead guy for?

03:12.735 --> 03:15.404
Wouldn't you rather have a live one,
like me?

03:19.784 --> 03:21.952
The board has spoken, creep!

03:24.538 --> 03:25.538
Oh, yeah?

03:27.124 --> 03:28.124
Hey!

03:31.462 --> 03:33.255
Well, now Nelson has spoken.

03:42.765 --> 03:44.600
- Who did that?
- Not me.

04:06.455 --> 04:07.540
<i>Terry, enough.</i>

04:07.915 --> 04:10.042
<i>You should be down at the piers
looking for smugglers.</i>

04:10.126 --> 04:12.962
<i>Not staking out your high school,
waiting for petty vandals.</i>

04:13.045 --> 04:14.296
Just one more sweep.

04:14.630 --> 04:17.630
If I can catch this so-called ghost
in the act, I can prove it's all a hoax.

04:20.469 --> 04:22.972
<i>You've already invested
too much time in this.</i>

04:25.099 --> 04:26.350
And it just paid off.

04:30.896 --> 04:31.897
It's him.

04:32.481 --> 04:33.566
It's Garrison.

04:35.985 --> 04:38.737
Come to us, Garrison.
We're here for you.

04:38.821 --> 04:40.364
Maybe you are, but I'm not.

04:59.091 --> 05:00.426
He's after Nelson.

05:07.725 --> 05:08.767
Whoa!

05:11.520 --> 05:14.064
Okay, Casper,
I can't believe I'm saying this,

05:14.148 --> 05:16.484
but you want Nelson,
you have to go through me.

06:18.587 --> 06:21.090
There's no way out.
There's no way out!

06:27.638 --> 06:28.639
Hey!

06:49.952 --> 06:52.746
It wanted Nelson.
It didn't care about the girls or me.

06:52.830 --> 06:53.872
Until I tried to help him.

06:54.164 --> 06:56.875
"It." So, now even you believe
it's a ghost.

06:57.376 --> 06:58.460
Everybody else does.

06:58.752 --> 07:00.438
The guys have even started
to dress like him.

07:00.462 --> 07:02.798
Some of the girls are wearing black
as a sign of mourning.

07:03.257 --> 07:04.800
You're not everybody else.

07:05.259 --> 07:08.137
These people believe
anything they can't explain is magic.

07:09.013 --> 07:11.223
Naturally, you don't believe
in those kind of things.

07:12.266 --> 07:14.602
Of course I do. I've seen it all.

07:14.935 --> 07:18.188
Demons, witch-boys, immortals, zombies.

07:18.522 --> 07:21.358
But this thing,
I don't know, it just feels so...

07:22.067 --> 07:23.402
So high school.

07:26.488 --> 07:29.033
They had this board and they used it
to call out to the ghost,

07:29.116 --> 07:30.116
and he came back.

07:30.242 --> 07:32.745
Just to talk to them. Schway, huh?

07:33.037 --> 07:35.122
Yes, dear, very "schway."

07:35.664 --> 07:38.500
Hey, maybe we could
hold a seance here, at home.

07:38.876 --> 07:39.876
What for, squirt?

07:40.210 --> 07:41.670
To bring Dad's ghost back.

07:44.298 --> 07:46.216
Matt, honey.

07:46.967 --> 07:48.844
There are no such things as ghosts.

07:49.219 --> 07:50.929
- But the board...
- It's a fake.

07:57.436 --> 07:58.520
Dad is gone, honey.

07:59.021 --> 08:00.981
He's not coming back, even as a ghost.

08:01.357 --> 08:03.901
But I need to see him again. I need to.

08:05.402 --> 08:06.904
I'm forgetting what he was like.

08:18.916 --> 08:20.834
We're all going to the mall after class.

08:20.918 --> 08:22.753
Everyone's going to be there, Chelsea.

08:22.836 --> 08:23.836
Cool.

08:33.055 --> 08:34.598
Ah! Perfect.

08:39.395 --> 08:41.689
Very funny.
Who turned up the cold?

08:42.064 --> 08:43.064
Hey!

09:00.916 --> 09:02.042
What's going on?

09:05.504 --> 09:06.504
Turn it off.

09:06.839 --> 09:07.839
I'm trying.

09:18.225 --> 09:19.268
Did you do that?

09:19.852 --> 09:20.894
I don't think so.

09:44.042 --> 09:45.169
Something's in there.

09:47.129 --> 09:48.464
Not your phantom menace.

09:50.632 --> 09:52.217
- You think?
- Sure.

09:52.301 --> 09:54.678
I mean, we're the ones
who raised his spirit.

09:54.762 --> 09:57.222
It's logical that he'd wanna contact us.

09:57.723 --> 09:58.891
In the showers?

10:00.100 --> 10:02.227
Oh, my God!
You've got to see this.

10:11.278 --> 10:12.863
"I still love you."

10:15.949 --> 10:17.367
Aw!

10:17.659 --> 10:20.829
None of my living boyfriends
ever left me a note like that.

10:20.913 --> 10:22.164
But who's it for?

10:23.373 --> 10:25.793
An invisible boy
in the girls' showers.

10:26.251 --> 10:27.961
- Why didn't I think of that?
- What?

10:28.045 --> 10:29.045
Never mind.

10:29.922 --> 10:32.382
We're trying to find out
who Garrison's girlfriend was,

10:32.466 --> 10:34.426
before he died,
and give her the message.

10:34.510 --> 10:36.553
But you said
Blade was the last one in the shower?

10:36.637 --> 10:38.722
Yeah, she saw it being written.

10:41.016 --> 10:42.016
Oh!

10:42.893 --> 10:44.520
You think the message was for Blade?

10:46.146 --> 10:48.357
First our so-called ghost
tried to kill Nelson.

10:48.816 --> 10:51.610
Then it left a love message for Blade.
Now, what connects them?

10:51.693 --> 10:52.861
They're not connected.

10:52.945 --> 10:54.780
They broke up,
after the thing at the pier.

10:56.907 --> 10:57.908
Oh!

10:58.242 --> 10:59.242
It all fits.

10:59.576 --> 11:01.995
The message, Nelson,
the shop teacher, the Coach.

11:02.538 --> 11:03.538
He hated them all.

11:03.914 --> 11:04.914
It's no ghost.

11:06.917 --> 11:08.043
It's Willie Watt.

11:15.175 --> 11:16.426
Welcome to juvenile hall.

11:16.718 --> 11:17.886
I've been here before.

11:22.558 --> 11:25.769
Be advised that all your activities
will be monitored from this point on.

11:26.144 --> 11:29.857
You'll have 15 minutes for your visit
with inmate number 7725.

11:31.650 --> 11:32.734
You're here to see Willie?

11:33.110 --> 11:33.944
Yeah. Why?

11:34.027 --> 11:35.404
Nobody ever comes to visit Willie.

11:35.904 --> 11:36.989
Not even his old man?

11:37.281 --> 11:39.741
No one.
Not in all the time he's been here.

11:40.158 --> 11:42.452
Nobody calls. Nobody writes.
It's creepy.

11:42.786 --> 11:44.204
But then again, so is Willie.

11:44.288 --> 11:45.888
Everyone here is a little afraid of him.

11:45.914 --> 11:48.166
Afraid? Of skinny Willie Watt?

11:48.625 --> 11:49.625
Yeah.

11:52.796 --> 11:53.796
Terry!

11:58.343 --> 12:00.846
It's not the worst place in the world,
just kind of boring.

12:01.263 --> 12:02.863
You've been hitting the weight machines.

12:03.015 --> 12:04.182
It helps pass the time.

12:04.516 --> 12:06.435
And I found out
that I like being strong.

12:06.518 --> 12:07.518
I'll bet.

12:08.979 --> 12:12.065
Besides, with good behavior,
I'll be out in less than two months.

12:14.985 --> 12:16.320
In time for the junior prom.

12:18.488 --> 12:20.115
If they'll have
the gym repaired in time.

12:21.617 --> 12:22.701
How'd you know about that?

12:25.162 --> 12:26.288
Someone from school told me.

12:26.622 --> 12:27.622
Who?

12:28.040 --> 12:29.791
What is this, McGinnis, 20 questions?

12:30.417 --> 12:33.879
The guard said no one ever
comes to see you or calls or writes.

12:34.880 --> 12:35.881
What are you saying,

12:35.964 --> 12:38.245
that I sneaked out ofjuvie
and paid a visit to the school?

12:38.550 --> 12:39.550
In a way.

12:43.472 --> 12:45.223
I don't know what you're talking about.

12:46.975 --> 12:47.975
I'm sure.

12:52.022 --> 12:53.273
The incident at the pier,

12:53.357 --> 12:55.837
it left you with some kind of
psychokinetic ability, didn't it?

12:55.984 --> 12:57.653
A gift from my friend the Golem.

12:57.736 --> 13:00.489
Everyone thinks you're a ghost.
It's all they talk about.

13:01.114 --> 13:03.450
I know. I'm the hero of the school.

13:03.533 --> 13:05.327
And that's not half of what I can do.

13:05.786 --> 13:07.996
Then why not just bust out of here?
Do what you want.

13:08.330 --> 13:09.790
'Cause everybody would know.

13:09.873 --> 13:11.667
In two months, I'll be gone from here.

13:11.959 --> 13:14.252
I have all this power and a normal life.

13:14.336 --> 13:15.754
If you don't trip on me.

13:15.837 --> 13:17.255
I know how to keep a secret.

13:19.841 --> 13:20.841
You better.

13:21.551 --> 13:22.594
I know where you live.

13:29.017 --> 13:30.352
Nice work, McGinnis.

13:30.811 --> 13:33.438
Face down, Watt!
Hands behind your head! Now!

13:36.942 --> 13:37.942
Cuff him!

13:42.030 --> 13:44.241
Willie, stop it now
or they'll never let you out.

13:50.914 --> 13:52.541
You should've stayed out of it, Terry.

13:52.624 --> 13:53.750
It would have been better,

13:57.004 --> 13:58.005
for everybody.

14:16.732 --> 14:18.358
What did you think was going to happen?

14:18.734 --> 14:20.902
I don't know.
I just had to be sure it was really him.

14:22.696 --> 14:24.114
I know. I messed up.

14:27.284 --> 14:29.286
One shot and he'll be out for hours.

14:29.661 --> 14:31.538
- If he shows up.
- Oh, he'll show.

14:31.621 --> 14:34.291
He's drawn to the school.
It's an obsession.

14:34.666 --> 14:36.209
Your area of expertise.

14:37.753 --> 14:39.463
I just have to get
close enough to use it.

14:40.881 --> 14:42.758
If I close this school
based on your hunch,

14:42.841 --> 14:43.841
and he doesn't show up,

14:43.884 --> 14:46.219
I'm going to have the school board
looking over my shoulder

14:46.303 --> 14:47.343
for the rest of my career.

14:47.471 --> 14:48.889
This is a court order.

14:48.972 --> 14:50.307
If you don't close the school,

14:50.390 --> 14:53.060
you'll have me looking over
your shoulder in the county jail.

15:00.108 --> 15:01.151
Attention, students.

15:01.443 --> 15:03.236
This is Principal Nakamura speaking.

15:03.320 --> 15:05.947
Classes will be suspended
until further notice.

15:06.031 --> 15:07.991
Please proceed to your homerooms,

15:08.075 --> 15:10.952
where you will be released
in an orderly fashion. Thank you.

15:13.413 --> 15:14.706
You're a hero to my people.

15:14.790 --> 15:16.708
You'd better be right
about this one, kid.

15:37.646 --> 15:39.481
Time to hit the waves.

15:44.778 --> 15:45.778
Surf's up.

15:56.832 --> 15:58.708
Stop!

16:18.854 --> 16:22.107
I never understood why you liked
to pick on the weaker kids, Nelson.

16:22.190 --> 16:23.190
Until now.

16:25.026 --> 16:27.320
It's not fair. You have powers.

16:27.404 --> 16:28.572
I don't stand a chance.

16:30.657 --> 16:33.201
Okay, if that's how you wanna play it.

16:33.285 --> 16:34.578
<i>Mano-a-mano.</i>

16:35.704 --> 16:36.705
No powers.

16:51.553 --> 16:53.972
Well, maybe just a little power.

17:07.903 --> 17:09.279
Willie, please.

17:09.863 --> 17:10.863
Please, what?

17:10.906 --> 17:13.158
You were interested in me
when you thought I was a ghost.

17:15.202 --> 17:16.202
Argh!

17:22.626 --> 17:25.337
Almost let down my defenses,
and just for a kiss.

18:28.984 --> 18:30.860
You know what I learned
in juvie, Batman?

18:31.069 --> 18:32.737
You don't kick a man when he's down.

18:39.911 --> 18:40.911
You crush him.

18:50.714 --> 18:51.714
Get away.

19:07.731 --> 19:09.107
Willie, look out.

19:40.055 --> 19:42.057
Sorry, kid. No visitors today.

19:51.358 --> 19:52.817
Hey, I remember this trip.

19:53.193 --> 19:54.277
It was great.

19:54.361 --> 19:56.071
You fell in that hornet's nest.

19:56.154 --> 19:57.154
I remember it, too.

19:57.489 --> 19:59.032
But not as fondly as you.

19:59.115 --> 20:00.909
Dad warned you
to watch where you were going.

20:00.992 --> 20:02.827
He knew about that kind of stuff.

20:02.911 --> 20:04.871
See? You do remember him.

20:04.954 --> 20:07.040
And he'll never be gone
as long as you keep him alive

20:07.457 --> 20:08.457
in here,

20:09.250 --> 20:10.250
and in here.

20:13.797 --> 20:15.548
- Or is it here?
