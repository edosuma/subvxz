WEBVTT

02:26.167 --> 02:28.970
The prototype
has been located.

03:35.370 --> 03:36.938
Water.

03:54.722 --> 03:56.224
I don't feel so good.

03:56.358 --> 03:59.327
Considering you've been buried
for over 300 years,

03:59.461 --> 04:01.129
you look pretty good to me.

04:01.429 --> 04:04.265
What? What the hell
are you talking about?

04:05.367 --> 04:06.801
Do I know you?

04:07.634 --> 04:09.636
You look kind of familiar.

04:10.405 --> 04:11.672
You can call me Tony.

04:12.140 --> 04:15.576
I'm a human clone of one of your
dead colleagues at the agency.

04:16.778 --> 04:18.645
You can't remember
a thing, can you?

04:19.546 --> 04:21.216
No, am I supposed to?

04:22.616 --> 04:25.020
Don't worry,
we're on the same team.

04:25.619 --> 04:27.554
We're the good guys.

04:27.688 --> 04:29.257
Your name is Garrett Brown.

04:29.391 --> 04:32.394
Your the last human survivor
of the nuclear war.

04:33.028 --> 04:37.232
Everything, everybody
you knew, is gone.

04:37.365 --> 04:39.733
What the hell are you
talking about, man?

04:42.170 --> 04:44.039
I don't believe anything
you're saying. What the...

04:44.172 --> 04:46.341
- Where the hell am I?
- Calm down.

04:47.075 --> 04:50.078
Look around.
The world you knew is gone.

04:50.345 --> 04:53.314
Your life has been preserved
until just the right moment.

04:53.448 --> 04:54.816
And this is it.

04:54.949 --> 04:57.152
But you have less
than one day of life in you.

04:57.285 --> 05:00.188
You have survived all this time
because you drank one of these.

05:02.157 --> 05:04.492
I've just given you an
additional injection.

05:04.625 --> 05:06.061
It'll help you remember.

05:06.194 --> 05:08.063
Trust me, we can't move forward

05:08.196 --> 05:10.165
if you don't remember
what happened.

05:10.298 --> 05:12.100
Why in the hell should
I trust you?

05:12.233 --> 05:14.635
You're dying.
You better believe that.

05:16.071 --> 05:17.172
I'm dying?

05:17.305 --> 05:19.107
What the hell did you
inject me with?

05:19.240 --> 05:21.575
It's an alien supplement.
I understand you had it before.

05:21.708 --> 05:24.012
Now concentrate.
We do not have much time.

05:24.145 --> 05:26.647
Hopefully, it will
help you remember.

05:28.216 --> 05:29.650
Hopefully.

05:31.386 --> 05:32.821
Hope.

05:33.720 --> 05:35.156
Reverend Hope.

05:36.291 --> 05:37.724
The case.

05:51.206 --> 05:53.775
We've become skeptical
evangelists

05:53.908 --> 05:55.443
full of fire and brimstone.

05:56.077 --> 05:58.313
Who come on television
to ask us for money.

05:59.713 --> 06:01.149
I am not going to do that.

06:02.484 --> 06:05.619
We've been criticized for using
our followers' donations

06:05.752 --> 06:08.056
to fund many successful
businesses.

06:09.090 --> 06:12.794
I felt we should use
the money responsibly,

06:12.927 --> 06:14.362
support ourselves.

06:16.464 --> 06:18.833
We have followers who are poor

06:18.967 --> 06:21.936
and it is difficult
for them to give.

06:23.071 --> 06:25.773
I am happy to announce today

06:25.907 --> 06:28.742
that the Jeremiah
C. Hope Ministries,

06:28.877 --> 06:31.645
will no longer
be accepting donations.

06:32.213 --> 06:35.250
We'll be the first of our kind
to operate

06:35.383 --> 06:37.919
without taking another penny
from anyone.

06:39.120 --> 06:41.122
<i>The United States
government pegged him</i>

06:41.256 --> 06:43.224
<i>as another false messiah.</i>

06:43.591 --> 06:47.028
They feared he would become the
most dangerous man in the world.

06:47.162 --> 06:50.697
Worse than Jim Jones,
David Koresh,

06:50.832 --> 06:52.967
even worse
than Mercury Mason,

06:53.101 --> 06:55.036
the deadliest of all
the false prophets.

06:55.702 --> 07:01.075
He was responsible for the
suicide deaths of 5,000 men,

07:01.209 --> 07:05.246
women and children
in August 2003.

07:05.380 --> 07:09.984
Jeremiah Hope, a simple country
boy from Georgia,

07:10.118 --> 07:13.221
who's pledged his life
to God's service.

07:13.354 --> 07:16.157
They weren't about to
let it happen again.

07:16.291 --> 07:17.492
Sci-Tech,

07:17.625 --> 07:20.495
a special investigation agency,
was created.

07:20.929 --> 07:25.066
The best of the FBI, CIA
and other special agencies

07:25.200 --> 07:27.302
throughout the free world.

07:27.435 --> 07:31.439
This time it was a different
case, a new enigma.

07:32.106 --> 07:35.243
It was about one man
and one man alone.

07:36.010 --> 07:38.913
Reverend Jeremiah C. Hope.

07:40.815 --> 07:42.450
Good, you're starting
to recover.

07:42.917 --> 07:44.786
Maybe, but I still
feel like crap.

07:45.220 --> 07:47.088
That's normal after
all this time,

07:47.222 --> 07:49.123
you'll be yourself
in no time, okay?

07:49.257 --> 07:51.659
What do you mean, "No time?"
One day, two days? What?

07:51.793 --> 07:53.428
Unfortunately, yes.

08:01.735 --> 08:04.172
Shit. We got company.
Stay down.

08:15.450 --> 08:17.652
That'll buy us some time.
Come on, we got to go.

08:17.785 --> 08:19.120
- Where to?
- That was our ride.

08:19.254 --> 08:21.856
We've got to find a place
to hide. Let's go.

08:59.160 --> 09:01.863
- Cigarette?
- No thanks.

09:01.996 --> 09:04.032
Last smoke on Earth.

09:06.968 --> 09:08.403
So, where are you taking me?

09:08.536 --> 09:10.171
Home.

09:10.305 --> 09:11.906
Home?

09:12.040 --> 09:13.741
To what's left
of the agency.

09:13.875 --> 09:16.311
Years ago, we built a
subterranean secret facility

09:16.444 --> 09:19.414
to protect us from
the radiation.

09:19.547 --> 09:21.015
Although the humans died

09:21.649 --> 09:23.418
we got our hands on
some alien technology

09:23.551 --> 09:25.586
and we managed
to clone ourselves.

09:27.021 --> 09:30.525
Only the fittest
and the strongest made it.

09:32.060 --> 09:33.494
What else do you remember?

09:34.962 --> 09:36.331
I don't know, man.
I'm too tired.

09:36.464 --> 09:38.933
Listen to me.
This is extremely important.

09:40.234 --> 09:41.502
Look, come on man.

09:41.636 --> 09:43.338
I don't know if you're real
or not.

09:43.471 --> 09:45.506
Seriously, tell me what
is going on here.

09:45.640 --> 09:48.609
Look, I have nothing to hide,
okay? I'm here to help you.

09:49.243 --> 09:53.214
Help me? Okay. Who buried me?

09:54.248 --> 09:56.084
Virgil Conway did.

09:56.819 --> 09:58.119
He wanted to preserve your life.

09:58.252 --> 09:59.954
He's also my creator.

10:00.088 --> 10:01.989
Do you remember him?

10:02.724 --> 10:04.158
Can't say I do.

10:05.126 --> 10:06.561
He's already dead.

10:09.397 --> 10:10.865
So why did you come for me?

10:10.998 --> 10:12.835
You'll find out later,
I promise.

10:12.967 --> 10:14.535
Great.

10:15.937 --> 10:17.806
Who was that that
just attacked us?

10:17.939 --> 10:20.174
Alien terrorists from
the planet Nobus.

10:21.676 --> 10:25.913
Nobus?
You're very creative, Tony.

10:26.047 --> 10:27.415
As I told you,
I'm here to help you.

10:27.548 --> 10:29.050
Now, what else do you
remember about this?

10:34.922 --> 10:36.825
<i>SciTech agency log.</i>

10:36.958 --> 10:39.994
<i>Monday, 17 April, 1998.</i>

10:40.128 --> 10:43.766
<i>Investigate the rising
of Reverend Jeremiah C. Hope.</i>

10:43.898 --> 10:47.402
<i>Mysterious disappearances at
Hope's discovery camps.</i>

10:47.535 --> 10:52.140
<i>Money ties with Future Corp
and CEO Stew Horn.</i>

10:52.974 --> 10:54.509
That was brutal.

10:54.642 --> 10:56.711
I love getting yelled at for an
hour straight, don't you?

10:56.845 --> 10:58.513
Yeah. Well, what do you expect?

10:58.646 --> 11:00.248
I mean, they've been trying
to keep this thing

11:00.381 --> 11:01.817
out of the media forever.

11:01.949 --> 11:03.451
Well, with the shit
that went down

11:03.584 --> 11:05.520
with Mercury Mason,
I can't say that I blame them.

11:05.653 --> 11:07.121
Shit man.

11:07.255 --> 11:08.923
Reverend Hope is going
to be on the cover

11:09.056 --> 11:12.026
of every major magazine and
every television show tomorrow.

11:12.895 --> 11:14.128
If the stress is too much,

11:14.262 --> 11:15.663
maybe you should consider
other work.

11:16.731 --> 11:18.566
The weak don't survive
in this business.

11:19.033 --> 11:20.568
Who you calling weak?

11:21.669 --> 11:23.471
It was just
a general statement.

11:23.604 --> 11:25.573
It was not directed
at anyone in particular.

11:27.008 --> 11:29.577
Come on. Let it go.

11:30.846 --> 11:32.781
He's just pushing your buttons.

11:32.915 --> 11:34.148
Good idea.

11:34.817 --> 11:37.985
Considering I'm the lead agent
in this investigation.

11:42.089 --> 11:44.459
You don't have to constantly
remind us.

12:01.342 --> 12:03.544
With this, we have plenty
to start turning up the heat

12:03.678 --> 12:05.112
on Reverend Hope.

12:05.246 --> 12:06.915
Why the delays?

12:07.748 --> 12:09.684
Our execution
has to be flawless.

12:09.818 --> 12:11.085
Our plan, perfect.

12:11.219 --> 12:13.354
Come on. The whole world
knows this guy.

12:13.488 --> 12:15.089
We've got to start pressuring
him now.

12:15.389 --> 12:18.459
We will not be reckless just
because we under scrutiny.

12:42.016 --> 12:43.584
More bullshit.

12:44.652 --> 12:47.588
I had a meeting with the contact
that gave me the pictures.

12:47.722 --> 12:48.957
Virgil Conway.

12:49.557 --> 12:51.459
All right. You finally found
out his name, huh?

12:51.592 --> 12:54.028
I had to go to Italy
to find the guy.

12:54.997 --> 12:56.664
Pictures, too.

12:56.798 --> 12:58.199
Who's the woman?

12:58.332 --> 13:00.869
His girlfriend.
Her name is Rosa.

13:01.003 --> 13:04.006
She's an exchange student
at a local university.

13:04.138 --> 13:05.573
Her family's in Italy.

13:06.707 --> 13:08.877
What, you only have
two pictures of her?

13:09.011 --> 13:10.678
It was windy.

13:10.812 --> 13:13.714
I kept waiting for her dress to
fly up so I could take more.

13:14.081 --> 13:17.585
- Never happened.
- The voice of a real pro.

13:18.119 --> 13:19.922
- She's not involved.
- Alright.

13:20.354 --> 13:22.256
This afternoon, I'm meeting
with a programmer

13:22.390 --> 13:24.425
from Future Corp that
got fired last week.

13:25.059 --> 13:26.594
Virgil's to contact
me tomorrow.

13:26.727 --> 13:28.062
Good.

13:28.195 --> 13:30.164
Well, I'll be with the fun
and exciting boys

13:30.298 --> 13:33.467
from electronic reconnaissance
all day tomorrow.

13:34.569 --> 13:39.607
Why don't you meet me at my
place in, uh, 42 hours.

13:40.141 --> 13:41.944
- All right?
- All right.

13:42.076 --> 13:44.012
- Hey.
- What?

13:44.478 --> 13:47.081
I've been investigating
something else lately.

13:47.715 --> 13:49.317
What's that?

13:50.284 --> 13:51.719
You're sleeping with Jenna.

13:54.121 --> 13:55.556
All right,
I'll catch you later.

14:02.129 --> 14:04.265
Goddamn,
can you say, "Obsessed?"

14:04.833 --> 14:06.367
Helps keep me focused.

14:06.500 --> 14:08.135
Well, at least you don't
have a picture

14:08.269 --> 14:10.404
- of him in a bathing suit.
- Oh, but I do.

14:10.538 --> 14:12.206
Keep it hidden
under my mattress.

14:13.008 --> 14:15.743
- Come on, show me what you got.
- All right.

14:19.881 --> 14:21.415
Virgil gave me this.

14:22.851 --> 14:25.087
This links Future Corp
to the Hope Ministries

14:25.219 --> 14:27.288
and number one to both of them.

14:28.090 --> 14:29.523
It's not enough.

14:29.657 --> 14:31.592
We need to catch
him in the act.

14:32.426 --> 14:34.662
I thought you might say that.

14:35.496 --> 14:37.632
He told me someone from Future
Corp is going to deliver

14:37.766 --> 14:39.700
a package to Number One
tomorrow night.

14:40.267 --> 14:42.169
Well, that package better
be damn important.

14:42.470 --> 14:43.872
We've got to convince Hines

14:44.006 --> 14:46.074
to let us go
after his number one agent.

14:46.207 --> 14:48.910
How about two million in cash?

14:50.012 --> 14:53.481
That's it.
Stew Herns from Future Corp.

14:53.614 --> 14:55.216
He's been transferring funds

14:55.349 --> 14:57.685
to offshore accounts for,
what, six months now?

14:57.819 --> 15:00.488
And I'll bet you it's close
to two million bucks.

15:01.123 --> 15:02.991
And it's a match.

15:03.792 --> 15:06.227
Why don't we just take the
money and go to Aruba?

15:06.862 --> 15:09.831
- I'd spend it in six months.
- Yeah, I believe that.

15:14.036 --> 15:15.804
Sure you wanna do this?

15:17.605 --> 15:19.041
Yeah.

15:19.173 --> 15:22.443
All right. We'll take this
to Hines in the morning.

15:22.576 --> 15:24.478
Go home and get some sleep.

15:30.085 --> 15:31.585
You've got balls.

15:34.522 --> 15:37.358
Are you sure that you
can prove this?

15:39.861 --> 15:43.731
- Absolutely.
- Enough to risk your own career?

15:44.099 --> 15:46.233
Yes, sir.

15:51.305 --> 15:52.974
I'm giving you the green light.

15:55.276 --> 15:57.712
Don't mess this up.

16:02.884 --> 16:04.552
No turning back now.

16:04.685 --> 16:06.822
Wouldn't have it any other way.

18:09.945 --> 18:11.813
You're a traitor
to the agency.

18:12.513 --> 18:14.615
Don't make this any
more difficult.

21:07.322 --> 21:08.857
Jesus.

21:45.860 --> 21:48.963
Jenna. Jenna, wake up.

21:49.097 --> 21:51.665
Come on, wake up.
What happened?

21:53.234 --> 21:57.038
Number One was here.
He killed everybody.

21:57.939 --> 21:59.640
No, no, no, no, no.

21:59.774 --> 22:01.943
That's impossible.
I just killed him.

22:03.144 --> 22:05.646
I don't want to die.
I don't want to die.

22:05.780 --> 22:08.116
Hey, hey, shh. Hey, hey.

22:08.249 --> 22:12.220
It's all right. It's all right.
It's going to be okay.

22:12.353 --> 22:13.788
I promise.

22:15.924 --> 22:17.724
Do you still love me?

22:20.395 --> 22:23.730
Hey. Of course I do.

23:20.588 --> 23:22.723
That belongs to me.

23:24.559 --> 23:26.161
What the hell?

23:27.395 --> 23:30.932
- Who are you?
- A good friend.

23:31.199 --> 23:34.435
- Now give me back the case.
- No.

23:35.036 --> 23:37.238
This belongs to the agency.

23:37.839 --> 23:39.274
Get back.

23:39.774 --> 23:41.109
I said step back!

23:42.844 --> 23:45.046
- He's back!
- Who the fuck are you?

23:45.180 --> 23:46.781
What the fuck do you want?

24:00.195 --> 24:02.130
This is what it's all about,
isn't it?

24:02.263 --> 24:04.399
This is what gives
you your power.

24:06.334 --> 24:08.903
Don't be a fool.
That won't work.

24:09.437 --> 24:12.207
Maybe not.
But I'll take that risk.

24:12.574 --> 24:14.776
I thought you were
our best agent.

24:14.909 --> 24:17.979
I am, and I always
finish the job.

25:09.964 --> 25:12.100
This is what it's all about.

25:12.700 --> 25:14.335
Information.

25:14.636 --> 25:16.404
That's the key to real power.

25:23.344 --> 25:24.746
Please!

25:24.879 --> 25:29.250
No, no, no!

26:45.593 --> 26:47.528
Mission accomplished.

26:48.463 --> 26:50.164
Proceed.

27:01.242 --> 27:03.311
Who's my next brain?

27:04.112 --> 27:06.581
A very important leader.

27:07.715 --> 27:11.185
You'll be surprised.

27:14.857 --> 27:16.657
Why am I being interrogated?

27:18.359 --> 27:21.195
I've got five dead bodies
to account for.

27:21.329 --> 27:23.498
One of them being
the agency director.

27:23.631 --> 27:25.933
The secretary of Defense
is breathing down my back

27:26.067 --> 27:28.503
and you're... the only survivor.

27:28.636 --> 27:30.972
- You think I did it?
- I ask the questions here.

27:31.105 --> 27:33.741
You answer them.
That's how it works.

27:33.876 --> 27:35.376
Understood.

27:38.613 --> 27:40.281
Now, someone dropped
the package off

27:40.415 --> 27:42.483
in the trunk of your
car last night.

27:42.818 --> 27:44.585
Who and what?

27:46.154 --> 27:48.322
He's a contact I have
in the Hope Ministries.

27:49.123 --> 27:51.459
It was blueprints
for his next camp.

27:52.960 --> 27:55.029
You went to see Stew Hern
last night.

27:55.163 --> 27:57.932
- Why?
- I never heard of him.

27:58.699 --> 28:01.269
What were you doing
in the parking garage?

28:01.402 --> 28:02.871
- My garage?
- The one in

28:03.004 --> 28:04.639
the apartment building
on Martel Street.

28:04.773 --> 28:07.408
- An agent saw you there.
- I've never been there.

28:07.542 --> 28:09.410
So you think the agent's lying?

28:10.011 --> 28:12.580
Maybe he thought he saw me,
but he was mistaken.

28:15.450 --> 28:17.452
How did you know
Number Three was dead?

28:18.921 --> 28:20.721
I wasn't aware of his death.

28:21.656 --> 28:23.191
Is that right?

28:23.324 --> 28:25.226
For your information,
his body was found

28:25.359 --> 28:28.262
on a park bench this morning
by the police in West Hollywood.

28:30.498 --> 28:32.166
How unfortunate.

28:36.304 --> 28:38.039
But you're sure Number Two
is dead.

28:38.172 --> 28:39.607
I saw his body!

28:40.074 --> 28:42.143
Who's Virgil Conway?

28:43.444 --> 28:45.179
The name doesn't
sound familiar.

28:45.313 --> 28:47.582
You know him. You reacted when
I mentioned his name,

28:47.715 --> 28:48.983
you weren't expecting it.

28:49.116 --> 28:50.418
I don't know a Virgil.

28:50.551 --> 28:52.320
You just don't know anything.
Do you?

28:52.453 --> 28:53.889
No.

28:54.188 --> 28:55.891
I have something
I think is going to help

28:56.023 --> 28:57.525
jar your memory.

29:11.372 --> 29:12.707
Apparently, I was wrong.

29:12.841 --> 29:14.977
Apparently so, now sit down.

29:19.046 --> 29:20.782
Wake up Number Two.

29:21.850 --> 29:24.185
I said, wake up Number Two.

29:25.486 --> 29:27.088
I think there's somebody here
you're really going

29:27.221 --> 29:28.756
to be surprised to see.

29:29.590 --> 29:31.058
Stop!

29:34.662 --> 29:37.365
Now why is it you two have
completely different versions

29:37.498 --> 29:39.433
about what went on last night?

29:40.002 --> 29:43.237
All I know is he killed
them all.

29:44.672 --> 29:46.440
Funny, he seems to
think you did.

29:48.010 --> 29:51.212
No way. Guy's a fricking freak.

29:53.047 --> 29:56.517
I shot him over and over again
and he didn't die.

29:57.118 --> 29:58.553
He killed them all.

30:00.254 --> 30:01.924
Number three and Jenna were
having an affair,

30:02.056 --> 30:03.558
you killed him in
a jealous rage.

30:03.691 --> 30:05.761
- No!
- I know people that would kill

30:05.894 --> 30:07.863
their own mother for $2 million.

30:08.830 --> 30:10.298
There was never any money
in the briefcase

30:10.431 --> 30:11.967
when I picked it up.

30:12.533 --> 30:14.770
- Money wasn't there.
- Bullshit!

30:14.903 --> 30:16.304
You have a clear motive.

30:16.437 --> 30:18.539
We have you on camera
entering the building.

30:18.673 --> 30:20.308
Now listen to me.

30:21.676 --> 30:25.346
He killed them all.
He killed Clay,

30:26.014 --> 30:28.583
and he went to the agency and
he killed the rest of them.

30:28.716 --> 30:31.185
I wasn't in the building.
I couldn't have done it.

30:32.486 --> 30:35.756
I can prove he's been
sabotaging our investigation

30:35.891 --> 30:37.725
- of Reverend Hope.
- You're desperate.

30:38.225 --> 30:39.795
All that money and
nowhere to go.

30:40.595 --> 30:44.198
Who are those two men
you met with yesterday

30:44.332 --> 30:46.133
from Future Corp?

30:46.267 --> 30:48.369
I don't know anyone from that
company.

30:51.172 --> 30:54.275
What about the pictures and
the documents I gave you?

30:54.408 --> 30:56.845
Number One has given me an
acceptable explanation

30:56.979 --> 30:58.546
for all of it.

30:58.679 --> 31:02.017
I have more, Hines. I have
enough to put this guy away.

31:02.383 --> 31:04.418
Produce the evidence.

31:04.552 --> 31:07.089
It was at my safe house.

31:07.823 --> 31:11.093
And I'm sure you took it after
you thought I was dead.

31:11.592 --> 31:14.228
But you have nothing to
back you up, Number Two.

31:14.462 --> 31:17.665
Christ. Can't you see
he set me up, Hines?

31:17.799 --> 31:21.003
Well, if he did, he did a pretty
goddamn good job of it.

31:21.135 --> 31:23.872
You were dead when we found
you, and now you're alive.

31:24.006 --> 31:28.175
- How?
- I don't know.

31:28.944 --> 31:30.411
"I don't know..."

31:31.612 --> 31:33.447
Excuse me, gentlemen.

31:41.089 --> 31:43.992
You're absolutely certain it
was Number One you saw driving

31:44.126 --> 31:45.559
into the apartment
on Martel?

31:45.994 --> 31:47.662
Positive.

31:51.033 --> 31:52.500
Take him out.

32:05.947 --> 32:07.481
What are you?

32:10.786 --> 32:12.653
The liquid you drank should
have killed you.

32:13.121 --> 32:15.924
- How did you survive?
- I don't... I don't know.

32:16.657 --> 32:21.129
- You feel different? Stronger?
- Yeah.

32:21.595 --> 32:24.298
Just like King fucking Kong!

32:26.534 --> 32:28.436
This presents an interesting
problem.

32:29.270 --> 32:31.139
You must come with me.
I won't hurt you.

32:31.272 --> 32:33.274
Yeah, right. Are you kidding me?

32:38.446 --> 32:40.214
Is that your best shot?

32:46.587 --> 32:49.423
The solution worked on you,
but not on the others.

32:51.059 --> 32:52.828
What others?

32:53.327 --> 32:55.197
I'm the only person
that can help you.

32:55.329 --> 32:56.564
Help me?

32:56.697 --> 32:58.466
You wanted to kill me.

32:58.599 --> 32:59.835
The liquid you drank
may kill you.

32:59.968 --> 33:01.870
I may be able to
save your life.

33:02.003 --> 33:04.505
Why save me? Last night
you wanted me dead.

33:04.840 --> 33:06.674
Come with me
and I will tell you.

33:08.409 --> 33:10.277
You can't kill me.

33:10.678 --> 33:12.413
You were so sure of yourself
last night.

33:12.546 --> 33:14.182
The way you toyed with me.

33:14.315 --> 33:15.683
But now you're afraid of me.

33:15.817 --> 33:18.552
I'm not afraid of you.
I want you alive.

33:19.054 --> 33:21.455
Yeah? Then come and get me.

33:23.491 --> 33:27.361
I will. Not now, but I will.

33:32.000 --> 33:35.837
That's it. After that,
my mind draws a blank.

33:36.171 --> 33:40.407
You will get it back. Patience.
Now we got to keep going.

33:40.541 --> 33:42.043
An old friend awaits us.

33:53.021 --> 33:54.455
Hold on to this.

34:00.128 --> 34:01.662
Cover your eyes.

34:25.753 --> 34:27.255
Hines.

34:27.388 --> 34:29.057
His clone actually.

34:29.590 --> 34:31.059
Sorry to have ordered
your execution,

34:31.193 --> 34:33.527
it was in the interest of
national security.

34:33.661 --> 34:35.629
Yeah, well, it looks like we
all screwed that one up

34:35.764 --> 34:37.364
real good, didn't we?

34:37.498 --> 34:39.901
As long as you are still alive,
there is half a chance.

34:40.035 --> 34:41.569
How is his memory now?

34:42.003 --> 34:44.239
Much better,
but he's not ready yet.

34:44.371 --> 34:45.639
Ready for what?

34:45.774 --> 34:47.708
You must recover
as much information

34:47.843 --> 34:50.178
as possible in order to
activate Virgil's message.

34:50.312 --> 34:52.413
- What message?
- We don't know.

34:52.546 --> 34:53.849
We were programmed
to bring you in

34:53.982 --> 34:55.817
once the radiation levels
had dropped.

34:58.086 --> 34:59.855
Computer is ready, sir.

35:08.129 --> 35:09.663
Take a seat, Garrett.

35:14.135 --> 35:15.636
So why me, Hines?

35:16.905 --> 35:20.175
You were exposed to chemical
warfare in the Persian Gulf.

35:20.942 --> 35:23.278
Your DNA mutated with the
alien supplement,

35:23.410 --> 35:25.046
providing you superior
strength.

35:25.679 --> 35:27.182
But as you found out,

35:28.183 --> 35:30.584
plenty of side effects
and certain death.

35:31.719 --> 35:33.520
- I see.
- You were just lucky to last

35:33.654 --> 35:35.957
a little bit longer
than the rest of the humans.

35:37.424 --> 35:38.960
I have
computer sync up, sir.

35:39.094 --> 35:41.062
Take us back into
your memories, Garett.

35:41.196 --> 35:42.496
The more you can remember,

35:42.630 --> 35:44.366
the more accurate Virgil's
message will be.

35:44.698 --> 35:46.868
Tell us about Virgil Conway.

36:09.590 --> 36:11.192
You're one unique man.

36:12.160 --> 36:14.129
You'd think I'd come out
here to paint the lake,

36:14.262 --> 36:15.797
or the hills?

36:16.630 --> 36:18.199
What are you going to call it?

36:18.767 --> 36:21.169
"Nobus At Peace."

36:22.070 --> 36:23.637
Nobus?

36:23.772 --> 36:25.539
Just a place I made up.

36:26.841 --> 36:29.010
A place in that wild
imagination of yours.

36:32.646 --> 36:34.182
I love it, Virgil.

36:46.294 --> 36:48.330
<i>You've been criticized
for using</i>

36:48.462 --> 36:51.933
charitable donations to build
a corporate empire.

36:52.067 --> 36:54.069
Why do you need all that money?

36:54.202 --> 36:56.470
I have never benefited
personally from the money.

36:57.205 --> 36:59.673
Money was going to various
charities.

37:00.241 --> 37:02.344
Also, my discovery camps.

37:02.509 --> 37:04.012
<i>Discovery camps?</i>

37:04.145 --> 37:08.116
Cities you will build, places
free from crime and hate.

37:09.184 --> 37:10.919
We will invite people
of all races,

37:11.052 --> 37:13.754
rich and poor alike as
brothers and sisters.

37:14.688 --> 37:17.558
We hope those
that do not follow God

37:17.691 --> 37:20.862
will come to our camps
and discover him.

37:20.996 --> 37:25.000
Those that have the faith will
be able to learn more.

37:25.133 --> 37:27.568
Situations like these always
end in tragedy.

37:27.701 --> 37:30.338
Jim Jones, Mercury Mason.

37:30.805 --> 37:32.506
I understand the criticism.

37:33.507 --> 37:37.212
These camps will not be
isolated like Mercury Mason's.

37:37.479 --> 37:40.614
<i>The people will be free to come
and go as they please.</i>

37:40.949 --> 37:43.751
I believe in trusting
the people on this Earth.

37:44.618 --> 37:46.388
I believe in their good nature.

37:47.288 --> 37:49.157
The people will govern
themselves.

37:49.656 --> 37:51.625
What are your ties with
Future Corp?

37:51.760 --> 37:54.829
I have none.
I have no need for computers.

37:55.629 --> 37:57.198
I was told you
have an announcement

37:57.332 --> 37:58.532
you would like to make.

37:58.665 --> 38:02.603
Unfortunately,
I have grave news.

38:03.371 --> 38:05.106
Five days from now,

38:05.240 --> 38:08.476
Southern California is going to
be devastated by an earthquake.

38:09.277 --> 38:11.545
<i>I believe it will be at
least an eight on the Ric...</i>

40:32.153 --> 40:34.489
You knew
you couldn't hide forever.

40:34.622 --> 40:35.957
How did you find me?

40:36.090 --> 40:38.526
Persistence.
Along with your sloppiness.

40:39.761 --> 40:42.664
Actually, we stopped looking
until you became an informant

40:42.797 --> 40:44.832
for the United States
government.

40:51.773 --> 40:53.208
Hey!

41:25.573 --> 41:27.275
The miracle will burn!

41:29.444 --> 41:30.878
Who are you?

41:31.412 --> 41:32.981
You're welcome.

41:33.114 --> 41:34.549
Why did you save me?

41:34.682 --> 41:36.750
- Did you set us up?
- Who?

41:37.218 --> 41:38.786
You're Clay's contact, right?

41:38.920 --> 41:41.656
Ah, your Clay's partner.

41:41.789 --> 41:44.092
I was. He's dead.

41:45.159 --> 41:47.428
I'm sorry. Stay there.

42:12.587 --> 42:14.389
I drank one of these puppies,
it nearly killed me.

42:14.522 --> 42:16.057
- Are you sure you drank this?
- Yeah.

42:16.190 --> 42:17.659
How did you get a hold of it?

42:17.792 --> 42:20.094
Came across it while
investigating another agent.

42:20.763 --> 42:22.330
I see. Help me here.

43:00.803 --> 43:02.337
Sorry about that.

43:05.808 --> 43:07.342
What the hell did
you do that for?

43:07.475 --> 43:09.410
I had to see if
you were telling the truth.

43:09.544 --> 43:11.446
The blue liquid you drank
is a diet supplement.

43:11.579 --> 43:13.848
It's supposed to help humans
improve their skills.

43:17.285 --> 43:18.886
So you shoot me in the chest?

43:19.020 --> 43:21.055
It hurts less than a gut shot.

43:21.189 --> 43:24.225
Yeah, well, don't ever
do anything like that again.

43:25.860 --> 43:27.729
So, how's this supplement
supposed to improve my skills?

43:27.862 --> 43:30.098
And by the way, where
the hell do you come from?

43:30.231 --> 43:32.300
I come from the planet Nobus.

43:32.433 --> 43:35.269
Great, another fucking alien.

43:35.804 --> 43:39.040
So which one are you?
E.T. or The Terminator?

43:39.173 --> 43:41.309
Neither. Morrucan.

43:42.343 --> 43:43.779
All right, moving on.

43:43.945 --> 43:45.413
You don't sound too surprised.

43:45.848 --> 43:48.182
With all the shit
I've seen in the last 48 hours,

43:48.316 --> 43:49.717
I believe just about anything.

43:49.852 --> 43:51.352
Well, there's more.

43:51.486 --> 43:53.822
The supplement will increase
your strength tenfold.

43:54.188 --> 43:56.090
Unfortunately,
I don't know its side effects.

43:56.224 --> 43:57.892
They've been testing it
on humans.

43:58.025 --> 43:59.660
No survivors.

43:59.961 --> 44:02.730
We need it in order to adapt
to this planet's atmosphere.

44:02.865 --> 44:04.800
A sip and we feel rejuvenated.

44:05.333 --> 44:07.034
So why test it on a human?

44:07.168 --> 44:08.569
I can't explain it all now.

44:08.837 --> 44:12.039
Piak, Number One to you,
is going to start wondering

44:12.173 --> 44:14.142
why they haven't
reported back yet.

44:15.443 --> 44:16.879
Time to explore.

44:29.223 --> 44:30.992
This is amazing.

44:32.059 --> 44:33.694
Is there any information
here we can use?

44:34.362 --> 44:35.630
We?

44:36.497 --> 44:38.433
I'll have to look at this later.

44:38.801 --> 44:40.268
All right, fine.

44:40.869 --> 44:43.237
So what is Reverend Hope's
part in all of this?

44:43.471 --> 44:46.140
He's a human puppet
controlled by the alien boss.

44:46.274 --> 44:49.710
Alien boss?
Yes. Allatarek.

44:50.478 --> 44:52.547
He's been their leader ever
since he arrived on my planet.

44:52.680 --> 44:54.348
Wait a minute.

44:54.482 --> 44:56.651
You're telling me that
he's an alien to you also?

44:56.785 --> 44:58.319
He tried to control our planet

44:58.453 --> 45:00.588
just like he's trying
to take over yours.

45:01.088 --> 45:02.557
What? He's trying
to conquer Earth?

45:02.690 --> 45:05.393
Not completely.
He just wants to use you.

45:06.060 --> 45:08.696
He wants Earth's raw materials
and its manufacturing

45:08.831 --> 45:11.332
infrastructure to build
ships and weapons.

45:11.466 --> 45:14.435
He wants your
population as soldiers.

45:14.870 --> 45:17.806
He plans on going back to
Nobus and continuing his war.

45:18.306 --> 45:21.609
Number One, Piak,
works for him.

45:22.143 --> 45:24.412
He was the most dangerous
terrorist on Nobus.

45:24.545 --> 45:26.882
His group had killed
thousands of people.

45:27.548 --> 45:29.852
One day this
Allatarek appeared

45:30.351 --> 45:33.087
and Piak allied with him.

45:34.355 --> 45:36.390
It's pretty bizarre
you'd have terrorism on a planet

45:36.524 --> 45:38.059
that's so advanced like yours.

45:38.192 --> 45:39.795
Just because technology
improves,

45:39.928 --> 45:41.996
doesn't mean people
improve along with it.

45:42.330 --> 45:46.367
True. So, does this
Allatarek control Piak?

45:46.501 --> 45:48.269
He, convinced Piak
he was sent to him

45:48.402 --> 45:49.905
from there, God, Allalak.

45:50.438 --> 45:52.206
He gained his trust.

46:00.314 --> 46:01.850
Help me get these guys
to the truck.

46:01.984 --> 46:03.618
Is it over yet?
Are they dead?

46:03.751 --> 46:06.187
In order to kill them, you
must first erase their brains,

46:06.687 --> 46:08.556
then cremate them.

46:11.894 --> 46:13.461
So how did you stop Allatarek?

46:13.594 --> 46:16.330
I infiltrated their group
and given away their position.

46:16.464 --> 46:19.200
We bombed them and destroyed
most of their facilities.

46:19.333 --> 46:20.668
He realized he couldn't win,

46:20.802 --> 46:22.537
but he still wanted
a piece of Nobus.

46:22.670 --> 46:24.338
An island the size
of your Africa

46:24.472 --> 46:26.008
the long part of the planet.

46:26.140 --> 46:27.642
He would use it to rebuild.

46:28.042 --> 46:30.645
He planned on attacking
our Temple of Thoughts.

46:30.779 --> 46:33.347
He wanted the community
of minds.

46:35.817 --> 46:38.286
Thoughts we've saved
of our great scientists,

46:38.419 --> 46:40.154
creative geniuses.

46:40.989 --> 46:42.623
Great minds that guide us.

46:50.598 --> 46:52.834
So how in the hell
did you get here?

46:52.968 --> 46:54.268
Oh, yeah, the good stuff.

46:54.836 --> 46:56.737
I informed my people
of their location.

46:56.872 --> 46:59.540
They bombed again, this time
with more powerful weapons.

47:00.008 --> 47:01.442
They destroyed everything.

47:02.778 --> 47:04.178
The terrorists also
discovered me,

47:04.312 --> 47:05.680
but didn't kill me.

47:05.814 --> 47:08.416
They took me with them to
the spaceship for ransom.

47:09.017 --> 47:10.318
Our navy was patrolling the area

47:10.451 --> 47:12.720
and was on them
the minute they took off.

47:13.287 --> 47:14.823
Cruisers pounded them.

47:15.456 --> 47:18.225
Damaged and desperate,
they headed out to space.

47:18.359 --> 47:20.261
The Navy was closing in.

47:21.596 --> 47:23.832
There was a dark matter
fold into space.

47:24.665 --> 47:27.168
Every probe we send through
there was destroyed.

47:27.501 --> 47:29.604
No one would even try
to take a ship through.

47:30.705 --> 47:33.641
Piak and this
Allatarek had no choice.

47:34.308 --> 47:36.078
We went through then
suddenly we're shot out

47:36.210 --> 47:37.779
at incredible speed.

47:38.145 --> 47:39.647
I was in restraints.

47:40.414 --> 47:43.150
We were thrown about the ship
and knocked unconscious.

47:44.285 --> 47:47.022
The computer system managed
to crash land the ship on Earth

47:47.154 --> 47:49.791
in a secure place
south of your continent.

47:53.061 --> 47:57.833
They put me in a gas chamber
and ejected me into the ocean.

48:00.234 --> 48:01.903
The machine didn't work.

48:03.237 --> 48:06.173
I was lucky.
I survived.

48:31.399 --> 48:32.633
Will you help me?

48:33.200 --> 48:36.104
I protected my world, it's
not my job to protect yours.

48:36.237 --> 48:38.006
I lost everything
I had fighting them,

48:38.140 --> 48:39.573
not this time.

48:39.707 --> 48:42.044
Why not? You can't go back
to the other aliens.

48:42.176 --> 48:44.378
You can't live amongst us
because we'll all be slaves.

48:44.512 --> 48:46.081
You have no place to go.

48:46.213 --> 48:48.649
They cannot control every piece
of land on this planet.

48:48.784 --> 48:50.685
I know of safe spots
that'll be left alone.

48:50.919 --> 48:53.721
It'll be a simple life.
But we'll be free.

48:54.588 --> 48:56.590
Who's we?
You and Rosa?

48:57.358 --> 48:58.827
How do you know about her?

48:59.660 --> 49:02.898
I have my sources.
After I fled the agency,

49:03.031 --> 49:07.535
I tracked you down, did my
homework and saved your life.

49:07.668 --> 49:09.470
- You think I owe you.
- Yeah.

49:09.771 --> 49:11.840
I didn't ask you to save me.
I don't owe you anything.

49:11.973 --> 49:13.607
I'll give you
what I have on them.

49:13.741 --> 49:15.777
You'll have to save
your world. Not me.

49:15.911 --> 49:18.279
Great. So, you're just
going to let us rot in slavery.

49:18.412 --> 49:19.915
Your people are going to
have to defend

49:20.048 --> 49:21.850
themselves like we did.

49:24.752 --> 49:26.487
But someone like you

49:26.620 --> 49:28.222
could give us the chance
we need to survive.

49:28.355 --> 49:30.424
- You can't stop him.
- But you did.

49:30.558 --> 49:32.194
There's nothing I can do now.

49:32.426 --> 49:34.462
Nothing you can do or will do?

49:34.695 --> 49:36.198
All right, then there's
nothing I will do.

49:36.330 --> 49:37.732
You can waste your time with me,

49:37.866 --> 49:39.567
or you can spend it
trying to stop them.

49:39.700 --> 49:41.736
That's bullshit.
Once they're done with us here,

49:41.870 --> 49:44.840
they'll return to Nobus
and finish what they started.

49:45.406 --> 49:47.641
You'd be best off
going to a safe area.

49:47.776 --> 49:50.078
Take your family with you.
It's your only chance.

49:50.212 --> 49:52.013
Give me the keys to your car.

49:52.147 --> 49:54.648
I'll give you a ride in the
city. That's all you're getting.

50:14.035 --> 50:15.937
So is it official?

50:16.071 --> 50:19.607
<i>The rumors are expected
to become official in minutes.</i>

50:19.841 --> 50:21.943
<i>If it is confirmed,
we are witnessing</i>

50:22.077 --> 50:24.846
<i>the first major assassination
of the new millennium.</i>

50:25.279 --> 50:28.716
<i>It is a great loss for mankind.
It is a terrible moment.</i>

50:29.117 --> 50:32.453
Is there any word yet
on who is responsible?

50:32.921 --> 50:34.923
<i>They say it's the work
of one man,</i>

50:35.056 --> 50:37.826
<i>someone unknown to
the Vatican's inner circle</i>

50:37.959 --> 50:39.895
<i>or to the Pope's group
of advisers.</i>

50:40.262 --> 50:42.130
<i>Apparently he disappeared
mysteriously.</i>

51:04.920 --> 51:09.590
Virgil?

51:10.324 --> 51:12.326
Virgil?

51:16.131 --> 51:17.331
Virgil?

51:28.944 --> 51:30.477
Virgil?

51:30.611 --> 51:32.781
Virgil's fine but he won't be
back for a while.

51:32.914 --> 51:34.015
Who are you?

51:34.149 --> 51:35.817
It's all right,
I'm not here to hurt you.

51:35.951 --> 51:37.819
- I'm a government agent.
- Get out of my house, okay?

51:37.953 --> 51:39.553
I have something very important
to show you, please!

51:39.687 --> 51:41.422
Please, it's very important.
Wait.

51:42.057 --> 51:43.557
It's about Virgil.

51:45.193 --> 51:48.230
- What do you want from Virgil?
- He's in serious trouble.

51:48.362 --> 51:53.068
We're all in serious trouble.
You need to watch this.

51:54.002 --> 51:55.436
Please.

52:07.015 --> 52:09.750
Not completely.
He just wants to use you.

52:09.885 --> 52:13.021
He wants Earth's raw materials
and its manufacturing

52:13.154 --> 52:15.924
infrastructure to
build ships and weapons.

52:16.390 --> 52:18.793
He wants your population
as soldiers.

52:19.160 --> 52:20.762
This is fake, okay?

52:20.896 --> 52:23.865
I couldn't fake this.
If so, why is this truck here?

52:23.999 --> 52:25.699
Where's Virgil?

52:26.835 --> 52:28.303
This is my ID card.

52:28.435 --> 52:31.139
Contact SciTech, they'll
confirm everything with you.

52:32.340 --> 52:34.109
I don't trust you. Okay?

52:34.242 --> 52:38.445
This is fake.
Get off my property. Now!

52:43.785 --> 52:45.552
You didn't need to involve her!

52:45.686 --> 52:46.855
You gave me no choice!

52:46.988 --> 52:48.589
I should erase your thoughts

52:48.722 --> 52:50.557
and replace them
with those of a cockroach.

52:50.691 --> 52:52.060
Virgil, listen,

52:52.193 --> 52:54.628
if they can find you,
they can find her.

52:56.331 --> 53:00.734
- You're not an alien!
- Come on, Virgil, it can't be!

53:00.869 --> 53:03.238
- I'm sorry, I love you.
- You are sorry?

53:03.371 --> 53:05.106
You are sorry?
You love me?

53:05.240 --> 53:08.376
Please, Rosa.
I can explain. I love you.

53:08.509 --> 53:10.345
Virgil, get away from me!

53:11.012 --> 53:14.648
Rosa. Rosa,
you could be in danger!

53:16.151 --> 53:17.584
Shit!

53:20.855 --> 53:23.358
You don't understand.
She's all I have in this world.

53:23.490 --> 53:25.860
Give me back my car keys.
I can't do that.

53:33.969 --> 53:35.870
She'll be fine as long
as we work together,

53:36.004 --> 53:38.539
and the sooner we act,
the better it is for everybody.

53:38.672 --> 53:40.408
I should kill you.

53:40.541 --> 53:43.244
In order for you to help Rosa,
you have to help me.

53:44.012 --> 53:45.847
I can find Rosa on my own.

53:45.981 --> 53:49.583
True. What if Piak finds
her first somehow?

53:50.385 --> 53:52.753
You wouldn't give them
that kind of advantage.

53:52.887 --> 53:55.756
But that's exactly what
you're doing by not helping me.

53:57.092 --> 53:59.693
Mind your temper,
remember, we're equals.

53:59.828 --> 54:01.662
All I have to do
is get away from you.

54:01.796 --> 54:05.433
Filthy earthling.
I hope you're the first slave.

54:05.566 --> 54:07.202
Maybe Rosa will be.

54:09.270 --> 54:11.538
Sorry, I didn't want to have
to do things this way,

54:11.672 --> 54:13.174
but you left me no choice.

54:16.311 --> 54:20.382
I'll help you for now,
but I'm telling you will fail.

54:21.249 --> 54:23.351
What? Did they teach you
that in the Morrucan Army?

54:24.252 --> 54:27.956
Okay, let's check
the computer one more time.

54:35.397 --> 54:38.299
- What is it?
- It's a message.

54:39.566 --> 54:42.703
For us.
From Piak.

54:45.606 --> 54:49.610
- He has Rosa.
- No way.

54:56.550 --> 54:58.953
He also assassinated the Pope.

54:59.954 --> 55:01.990
Hello, gentlemen.

55:03.825 --> 55:06.127
You can't kill me, remember?

55:06.727 --> 55:08.296
I wouldn't bet on
that if I were you.

55:08.430 --> 55:11.598
Save it for later.
I need a favor from you.

55:11.732 --> 55:13.935
- Where's Rosa?
- Relax, Morrucan.

55:14.335 --> 55:17.072
She's fine.
I think she's enjoying

55:17.205 --> 55:18.572
her connection to the computer.

55:18.705 --> 55:20.607
You bastard.

55:23.011 --> 55:25.780
Wait a minute. Let him finish.

55:26.647 --> 55:29.583
Good. Now, listen carefully.

55:31.086 --> 55:34.588
Two days from now, Reverend
Hope will be in New York.

55:35.190 --> 55:36.991
He'll be staying
at the Plaza Hotel.

55:37.459 --> 55:40.328
He'll be in his room
between five and six o'clock,

55:40.462 --> 55:43.398
accompanied by only
five human bodyguards.

55:43.965 --> 55:48.236
At exactly 5:37,
you will shoot him in the chest.

55:48.803 --> 55:52.874
You'll make sure he dies. 5:37.

55:53.208 --> 55:56.244
Not a minute before,
not a minute after.

55:57.045 --> 56:01.249
You fail,
Rosa becomes my personal slave.

56:05.019 --> 56:07.288
Sooner or later, Piak.

56:08.490 --> 56:10.058
I can't wait.

56:11.493 --> 56:13.128
Goodbye for now, gentlemen.

56:17.398 --> 56:20.135
Why in the hell is
he betraying Allatarek?

56:20.969 --> 56:23.037
I believe it's because of you.

56:54.235 --> 56:57.105
- Garrett.
- God bless you.

56:57.906 --> 56:59.740
Now, that wasn't that hard,
was it?

57:00.308 --> 57:02.644
Remembering the past
is the easy part.

57:03.278 --> 57:05.446
Accepting the fact
that everyone's gone?

57:07.348 --> 57:08.950
I don't think
I'm prepared for this.

57:09.083 --> 57:11.920
Don't blame yourself.
Nobody saw it coming.

57:12.253 --> 57:14.322
Reverend Hope and Piak
worked hard to find

57:14.455 --> 57:16.791
a human that would survive
the DNA experiments.

57:16.925 --> 57:18.826
They made a big mistake
letting you go.

57:18.960 --> 57:20.461
They never saw your potential.

57:20.595 --> 57:23.198
All these centuries,
Piak has been heavily patrolling

57:23.331 --> 57:27.035
this planet, looking for you or
waiting for us to bring you in.

57:28.002 --> 57:29.804
We have been protecting
you for all this time.

57:30.471 --> 57:33.707
Earth was heavily contaminated,
so we had to wait.

57:33.841 --> 57:36.344
How in the hell
did we let this happen?

57:36.578 --> 57:37.744
There's no time for regrets.

57:37.879 --> 57:39.414
If Piak captures you,

57:39.547 --> 57:42.083
he will clone you
and create an invincible army.

57:43.518 --> 57:44.919
So what now?

57:45.153 --> 57:48.389
Over here, your palm
will activate the message.

57:58.299 --> 57:59.901
<i>Welcome back, Garrett.</i>

58:00.034 --> 58:01.936
<i>I'm glad you're still
in one piece.</i>

58:02.503 --> 58:04.572
<i>These have been some
tough years.</i>

58:04.706 --> 58:06.307
<i>You were right.</i>

58:06.441 --> 58:08.409
<i>I should have cared much
earlier about your planet.</i>

58:08.543 --> 58:11.879
<i>I am sorry I couldn't stop
the war on time.</i>

58:12.614 --> 58:14.515
<i>You have suffered
a great memory loss</i>

58:14.649 --> 58:16.851
<i>due to the alien
supplement you drank.</i>

58:17.585 --> 58:19.854
<i>When your body couldn't
resist it much longer</i>

58:19.988 --> 58:21.789
<i>and your death was inevitable,</i>

58:21.923 --> 58:25.927
<i>I decided to preserve your life
and await your resurrection.</i>

58:26.060 --> 58:28.162
<i>The community of
agreed</i>

58:28.296 --> 58:30.565
<i>that we should give
humanity a second chance,</i>

58:30.865 --> 58:33.101
<i>and they have planned
something special for you.</i>

58:33.468 --> 58:37.105
<i>Not far from here,
there is a hidden city.</i>

58:37.238 --> 58:39.841
<i>Inside the city,
there is a palace.</i>

58:40.375 --> 58:44.345
<i>Your destiny awaits you there.
Good luck to you, old friend.</i>

58:44.479 --> 58:47.115
<i>I am transmitting
the location now.</i>

59:01.029 --> 59:04.999
I got it. I know the way.

59:05.133 --> 59:07.201
Excellent.
We must be on the way then.

59:07.335 --> 59:11.539
Well, well, well.
Just like a class reunion.

59:12.173 --> 59:13.841
SciTech Agents united.

59:14.342 --> 59:18.146
Piak. I should have
killed you myself.

59:18.279 --> 59:20.815
No, sir,
I'm going to kill you this time.

59:20.948 --> 59:22.450
I got him, sir.

59:29.524 --> 59:32.660
I killed you once,
and I'll kill you again,

59:32.795 --> 59:34.395
and I'll kill your clones

59:34.529 --> 59:37.098
and the clones of
your clones as I please.

59:37.732 --> 59:39.200
This is my planet now,

59:39.334 --> 59:41.602
and I will rule it
without any interference.

59:41.736 --> 59:42.970
I'm your interference now.

59:43.104 --> 59:44.405
What the hell
were you thinking

59:44.539 --> 59:46.274
when you destroyed
the entire planet?

59:46.407 --> 59:48.276
Come here and I'll kill you
with my bare hands.

59:48.409 --> 59:51.379
Don't get emotional on me now.
Just make it easy for everybody.

59:51.512 --> 59:52.847
Just surrender.

59:52.980 --> 59:56.951
- Not likely.
- Look at you now, old man.

59:58.152 --> 59:59.554
I've waited a long
time to find you.

59:59.687 --> 1:00:01.556
Well, I'm not going
anywhere without a fight.

1:00:01.689 --> 1:00:04.592
Get out of here, boys. I'll
handle these puppets myself.

1:00:28.716 --> 1:00:30.184
Are you okay?

1:00:31.519 --> 1:00:34.455
I think so, but I'm feeling
kind of weird again.

1:00:37.558 --> 1:00:39.927
This is the last supplement
we have left.

1:00:43.164 --> 1:00:44.532
Blue liquid.

1:00:44.665 --> 1:00:46.300
Gotta love this stuff.

1:00:46.769 --> 1:00:48.503
You're welcome.

1:00:59.213 --> 1:01:00.849
You think Piak's dead?

1:01:00.982 --> 1:01:03.418
He's getting stronger
every minute.

1:01:03.918 --> 1:01:05.286
We can't take any chances.

1:01:05.420 --> 1:01:06.855
Well, in that case, follow me.

1:01:06.988 --> 1:01:09.223
I know where the hidden
palace is.

1:01:20.468 --> 1:01:23.438
- There.
- There's nothing there.

1:01:24.071 --> 1:01:26.374
Can't you see it?
It's right there. Come on.

1:01:29.143 --> 1:01:32.113
- You see it now?
- No.

1:01:32.246 --> 1:01:33.714
You got a gun?

1:01:44.325 --> 1:01:46.160
Un-fucking-believable.

1:01:46.294 --> 1:01:48.129
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1:03:54.056 --> 1:03:57.491
Welcome.
We've been expecting you.

1:03:58.392 --> 1:03:59.660
And you are?

1:03:59.795 --> 1:04:04.800
I am Queen Ilona.
And you are my guest.

1:04:05.299 --> 1:04:06.634
Queen of who exactly?

1:04:07.168 --> 1:04:11.974
My planet was devastated like
yours by Piak and his army.

1:04:12.908 --> 1:04:15.242
The community of mines
have brought us here

1:04:15.376 --> 1:04:17.779
to rebuild our society.

1:04:17.913 --> 1:04:19.614
So why am I here?

1:04:19.747 --> 1:04:22.884
You are the reason
this palace exists.

1:04:23.618 --> 1:04:27.221
You are the one
who will save mankind.

1:04:27.755 --> 1:04:30.725
I don't recall applying
for that job.

1:04:30.859 --> 1:04:32.727
A gift was given to you.

1:04:32.861 --> 1:04:37.298
Your survival will give the
human race a second chance.

1:04:37.431 --> 1:04:39.034
I don't quite understand.

1:04:39.166 --> 1:04:40.635
You will.

1:04:41.469 --> 1:04:42.904
We're running out of time.

1:04:43.038 --> 1:04:46.440
Ladies, please escort
our guest to his room.

1:04:46.842 --> 1:04:49.710
Make sure he gets ready
for the ceremony.

1:04:49.845 --> 1:04:51.646
Ceremony?

1:04:51.780 --> 1:04:55.650
This might sound strange,
but a ceremony must take place

1:04:55.784 --> 1:05:00.655
in order for the community of
mines to send you back in time.

1:05:01.155 --> 1:05:02.556
Back in time?

1:05:02.690 --> 1:05:05.861
Yes, you will be travelling
soon.

1:05:39.493 --> 1:05:42.764
Now, let's get
the ceremony started.

1:05:43.197 --> 1:05:44.732
When the light comes,

1:05:44.866 --> 1:05:48.970
you must plunge this
dagger into your heart.

1:05:50.604 --> 1:05:52.473
Yeah, right.
That sounds like a great plan.

1:05:52.606 --> 1:05:56.011
Your sacrifice
will save your world.

1:05:56.144 --> 1:05:57.478
Look, Queen. I'm sorry,

1:05:57.611 --> 1:05:58.980
I don't mean to rain
on your parade,

1:05:59.114 --> 1:06:00.816
but I've been buried
a few hundred years,

1:06:00.949 --> 1:06:02.683
I haven't got
my memory back yet.

1:06:02.818 --> 1:06:05.153
And you expect me
to commit suicide,

1:06:05.286 --> 1:06:08.222
travel back through time
so I can save the human race?

1:06:08.355 --> 1:06:12.194
- Exactly.
- And if I don't?

1:06:12.326 --> 1:06:15.163
There is not much life
left in you.

1:06:15.629 --> 1:06:18.033
It is the only way
to save your planet

1:06:18.166 --> 1:06:20.802
and change this dark future.

1:06:22.003 --> 1:06:24.271
My queen, the army
has surrounded the temple.

1:06:24.405 --> 1:06:26.507
The shield won't resist
much longer.

1:06:35.917 --> 1:06:37.718
Let's do something!

1:06:37.853 --> 1:06:40.688
We are not warriors,
we have no weapons.

1:06:40.822 --> 1:06:42.924
Great,
you're going to get slaughtered.

1:06:43.424 --> 1:06:45.227
Why don't I just
turn myself over?

1:06:45.359 --> 1:06:47.361
No, you can't do that.

1:06:47.495 --> 1:06:49.263
You must fulfill your destiny.

1:06:49.396 --> 1:06:51.699
We must get the ceremony
started.

1:06:51.833 --> 1:06:54.335
I'd rather just fight them.

1:07:36.144 --> 1:07:38.079
Stay down. Get down.

1:07:52.861 --> 1:07:54.763
Glad you could join the party.

1:07:54.996 --> 1:07:56.363
Who's the lady?

1:07:56.497 --> 1:07:58.967
Queen Ilona,
meet your savior, Tony.

1:07:59.500 --> 1:08:01.402
Thank you for your help.

1:08:01.702 --> 1:08:04.471
Once this is over,
you will be rewarded.

1:08:04.605 --> 1:08:07.541
- Thanks.
- Not bad for a clone.

1:08:08.310 --> 1:08:10.511
- Is there another way out?
- No.

1:08:10.946 --> 1:08:12.280
Yes, there is.

1:08:12.413 --> 1:08:13.915
Let's give 'em some hell.

1:08:14.448 --> 1:08:16.684
- Stay here.
- Ready?

1:08:41.375 --> 1:08:43.078
Piak!

1:09:15.176 --> 1:09:16.945
No.

1:09:19.848 --> 1:09:21.582
Ilona?

1:09:23.584 --> 1:09:27.688
The light...
it's coming for us all.

1:09:37.132 --> 1:09:38.934
Erase his thoughts.

1:10:33.788 --> 1:10:36.157
Interesting.

1:10:39.027 --> 1:10:40.728
You're next.

1:10:40.862 --> 1:10:42.696
Did you have a nice nap?

1:10:43.031 --> 1:10:44.531
Get enough rest?

1:10:44.665 --> 1:10:47.335
Oh, and by the way,
sorry about your planet.

1:10:47.902 --> 1:10:49.471
Just taking care of business.

1:10:49.603 --> 1:10:51.439
Terrorism business?

1:10:51.840 --> 1:10:54.109
Slaughtering millions of people?

1:10:54.409 --> 1:10:56.378
Destroying an entire planet?

1:10:56.710 --> 1:10:59.114
You're going to pay
big time for it, Piak.

1:10:59.580 --> 1:11:01.582
You're the last survivor
of a weak race,

1:11:01.715 --> 1:11:03.351
you have nowhere to run now.

1:11:03.985 --> 1:11:06.855
Who's running?
Your time's up.

1:11:07.422 --> 1:11:09.290
And what makes you
think you can beat me?

1:11:09.424 --> 1:11:13.128
You're one small alien
on the wrong planet

1:11:13.261 --> 1:11:15.263
at the wrong time.

1:11:17.932 --> 1:11:19.666
I'll make you a deal.

1:11:21.169 --> 1:11:24.139
You give me your DNA sequence
and I'll let you live.

1:11:24.839 --> 1:11:26.540
I'll even spare
a few of these women.

1:11:26.673 --> 1:11:28.143
You can start a family.

1:11:28.877 --> 1:11:32.113
Nice offer.
But I've got a better plan.

1:11:32.613 --> 1:11:34.615
How about we travel
back through time

1:11:34.748 --> 1:11:36.650
and you die in the process?

1:11:37.352 --> 1:11:40.522
So many years and you haven't
lost that sense of humor.

1:11:40.889 --> 1:11:42.689
Remember, you can't kill me.

1:11:43.324 --> 1:11:46.127
I am what you humans call
"immortal."

1:11:46.494 --> 1:11:50.865
And you... you were the prototype
of a new breed,

1:11:51.232 --> 1:11:54.369
a new race that
will make my army stronger.

1:11:55.136 --> 1:11:58.907
You humans,
the missing link in my quest.

1:11:59.040 --> 1:12:02.811
Well, keep dreaming, Piak.

1:12:46.521 --> 1:12:48.089
I gave you a chance.

1:14:31.993 --> 1:14:34.062
Show time.

1:17:00.675 --> 1:17:02.877
Good morning.

1:17:10.218 --> 1:17:11.719
Where are we?

1:17:11.854 --> 1:17:14.389
I found you outside
the house last night naked

1:17:14.522 --> 1:17:17.492
and you had a wound
to your chest.

1:17:19.227 --> 1:17:20.763
Don't you remember?

1:17:20.895 --> 1:17:25.233
And who are you and what are
you doing on my claim?

1:17:27.468 --> 1:17:29.637
I'm sorry, I can't remember.

1:17:31.005 --> 1:17:33.007
Um...

1:17:35.743 --> 1:17:40.081
I'm a little confused.
Where are we exactly?

1:17:40.214 --> 1:17:43.484
Tombstone, Arizona Territory.

1:17:45.520 --> 1:17:48.623
Seriously?
Of all the places,

1:17:48.756 --> 1:17:51.292
I get stuck in a tourist trap.

1:17:52.427 --> 1:17:55.430
We don't get many
tourists around here.

1:17:56.297 --> 1:18:00.601
Just prospectors...
like my late husband,

1:18:00.735 --> 1:18:03.604
and thirsty cowboys.

1:18:07.742 --> 1:18:11.512
- What year is it?
- 1880.

1:18:13.916 --> 1:18:15.716
Look, um...

1:18:16.651 --> 1:18:18.386
I want to thank you
for your hospitality,

1:18:18.519 --> 1:18:20.789
but I got to get out of here.
I got to go.

1:18:20.923 --> 1:18:22.590
Go where?

1:18:22.723 --> 1:18:25.159
I got to go to the authorities
to figure all this out.

1:18:25.293 --> 1:18:28.797
Perhaps Sheriff Clark
can help you?

1:18:29.964 --> 1:18:33.668
If you're going to do that,
you'll need better clothing.

1:18:33.802 --> 1:18:35.336
Yes, please.

1:18:35.470 --> 1:18:40.074
I think you're about the same
size as my late husband.

1:18:41.309 --> 1:18:43.110
Here, take these.

1:18:43.244 --> 1:18:46.214
All right.
Thank you for your hospitality.

1:18:46.347 --> 1:18:47.916
What... What's your name?

1:18:48.082 --> 1:18:51.719
- Carol.
- Carol. I'm Garrett.

1:18:52.587 --> 1:18:53.721
Nice to meet you.

1:18:53.856 --> 1:18:57.091
Pleasure to meet you
and thank you very much,

1:18:57.225 --> 1:18:59.427
but I got to get going.

1:19:45.673 --> 1:19:46.875
Sheriff.

1:19:54.649 --> 1:19:56.384
Sheriff.

1:19:59.587 --> 1:20:01.188
You ain't from around here.

1:20:01.322 --> 1:20:02.824
Funny you should say that,

1:20:02.958 --> 1:20:04.927
because I'm definitely
not from around here.

1:20:05.059 --> 1:20:06.828
Well, where are you coming from?

1:20:07.228 --> 1:20:09.263
I can't really say,

1:20:09.765 --> 1:20:12.768
but I need to confirm that
you are who you say you are

1:20:12.901 --> 1:20:15.703
and that we are where
you believe we are.

1:20:17.806 --> 1:20:19.507
I don't follow you there.

1:20:19.640 --> 1:20:21.742
You better start talking,
who are you?

1:20:21.877 --> 1:20:25.379
Okay. I am from the future.

1:20:25.781 --> 1:20:27.481
Your future.

1:20:27.615 --> 1:20:31.218
But something happened and I
wasn't supposed to end up here.

1:20:31.820 --> 1:20:33.454
But where
are you supposed to be?

1:20:33.588 --> 1:20:36.557
That's not important.
My name is Garrett Brown.

1:20:36.691 --> 1:20:38.693
I'm a special agent
for the U.S. government,

1:20:38.827 --> 1:20:41.429
and I need to speak to the
president as soon as possible.

1:20:43.331 --> 1:20:45.566
We don't go for that
crazy talk around here.

1:20:45.968 --> 1:20:47.803
I think you're
going to need to stay here

1:20:47.936 --> 1:20:49.103
until we figure out who you are.

1:20:49.236 --> 1:20:51.305
Lock him up, boys.

1:21:13.160 --> 1:21:16.098
<i>El diablo!
El diablo!</i>

1:21:16.230 --> 1:21:18.666
Don't know how the hell
that happened.

1:21:19.400 --> 1:21:22.236
Haul him back to the jail,
lock him up.

1:21:39.687 --> 1:21:42.858
You boys clear out. I need
to talk to this man alone.

1:21:53.035 --> 1:21:55.202
It's just me and you in here.

1:21:56.537 --> 1:21:59.273
You tell me your story
and I'll listen.

1:22:00.574 --> 1:22:04.378
Sure you're ready?
It's a hell of a ride.

1:22:05.047 --> 1:22:07.214
That is one hell of a story.

1:22:10.052 --> 1:22:15.589
- I believe you.
- You do. I do, Garrett.

1:22:16.892 --> 1:22:18.626
I got a telegram.

1:22:19.527 --> 1:22:23.999
Sky man, like you, showed up
in Las Cruces, New Mexico

1:22:24.132 --> 1:22:26.367
a couple of days ago
and killed a few men.

1:22:26.500 --> 1:22:29.437
According to this,
he's heading this way.

1:22:31.006 --> 1:22:32.606
Can't be him, can it?

1:22:32.740 --> 1:22:34.810
You mean that Pee-yak?

1:22:34.943 --> 1:22:36.644
- Piak.
- Piak.

1:22:36.978 --> 1:22:39.948
The alien conqueror
from your story?

1:22:40.882 --> 1:22:44.152
If your story's true,
and I assume it is,

1:22:44.719 --> 1:22:46.888
we better be ready for him.

1:22:47.022 --> 1:22:48.824
I agree.

1:24:19.247 --> 1:24:21.315
Whiskey.

1:25:02.791 --> 1:25:06.995
- You look good.
- So do you. I think.

1:25:07.461 --> 1:25:08.997
Didn't I just kill you?

1:25:09.998 --> 1:25:13.434
Gentlemen, my friend here
thinks I can be killed.

1:25:14.002 --> 1:25:16.503
A mistake he made
more than once.

1:25:18.940 --> 1:25:21.142
You will find this
information amusing.

1:25:22.610 --> 1:25:24.980
There was a glitch
in the system.

1:25:25.613 --> 1:25:27.916
A virus was unleashed
into your population,

1:25:28.049 --> 1:25:31.652
followed by a deadly pandemic,
and as you can imagine,

1:25:31.987 --> 1:25:35.857
the community of minds
wanted to preserve your life

1:25:35.991 --> 1:25:38.860
once again,
but gave you no warning.

1:25:39.727 --> 1:25:41.562
So here we are.

1:25:41.695 --> 1:25:45.834
Both of us stuck in
the past with no army,

1:25:45.967 --> 1:25:49.304
no purpose and no blue liquid.

1:25:49.436 --> 1:25:51.139
What a shame.

1:25:53.141 --> 1:25:55.911
Well, maybe my DNA
could be a cure.

1:25:56.311 --> 1:25:57.946
Too many maybes.

1:25:58.813 --> 1:26:00.514
Sheriff?

1:26:01.749 --> 1:26:03.818
You have exactly one minute

1:26:03.952 --> 1:26:07.055
to go outside
and release your prisoner to me.

1:26:07.188 --> 1:26:10.926
If you fail to comply,
I will have every gun

1:26:11.059 --> 1:26:14.963
for hire in this dust bowl
shoot anyone who opposes.

1:26:15.797 --> 1:26:18.166
That includes
women and children.

1:26:18.900 --> 1:26:21.102
Ask him, I'm good for that.

1:26:27.809 --> 1:26:29.210
Listen up, cowboys,

1:26:29.945 --> 1:26:34.015
I will pay $1,000 dollars
to whoever brings me Diablo.

1:26:34.149 --> 1:26:35.417
Dead or alive.

1:26:35.582 --> 1:26:38.652
- Who wants to play?
- I do! I do!

1:26:48.263 --> 1:26:52.100
Whatever happens,
he cannot capture me.

1:26:52.867 --> 1:26:54.936
Burn my body if necessary.

1:26:55.770 --> 1:26:59.874
- He wants your DNA?
- Correct.

1:27:00.474 --> 1:27:02.643
What the hell's DNA?

1:27:06.147 --> 1:27:07.949
Let him out.

1:27:19.928 --> 1:27:21.262
It's been a pleasure
to know you.

1:27:21.396 --> 1:27:22.964
Let's give them some hell.

1:28:43.845 --> 1:28:45.712
This is my army?

1:29:24.052 --> 1:29:25.820
You're not going to capture me.

1:29:26.488 --> 1:29:28.655
I've got something
better than the blue liquid

1:29:28.790 --> 1:29:30.657
if you want to stick around
a little longer.

1:29:36.030 --> 1:29:37.832
This is your ticket home.

1:29:40.235 --> 1:29:42.170
Reload,
I'll give you a chance.

1:29:55.216 --> 1:29:59.087
You know bullets can't kill...

1:30:05.160 --> 1:30:06.928
You want to go
back to the future

1:30:07.061 --> 1:30:11.132
and I'll risk everything
to kill you.

1:30:17.906 --> 1:30:20.208
You want my DNA, asshole?
