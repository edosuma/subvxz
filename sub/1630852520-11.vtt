WEBVTT

00:00.901 --> 00:02.167
- Zorka.

00:02.203 --> 00:04.570
7th generation psychic.

00:04.572 --> 00:06.238
- We want to talk to you
about balda.

00:06.240 --> 00:08.907
- She gave me a usb.
I should give it to you,

00:08.976 --> 00:11.376
If my charges are dropped.

00:11.445 --> 00:12.710
- Why does adeline have this?

00:12.747 --> 00:13.879
- This is how she got the cartel

00:14.014 --> 00:15.380
To supply the coyotes
the pink cocaine.

00:15.449 --> 00:17.850
Sell me your drugs, or I tell
your macho friends

00:17.852 --> 00:19.250
You like teenage boys.

00:19.286 --> 00:21.520
- Davidson and mcconnell
filed an official complaint

00:21.589 --> 00:23.055
Against you this morning.

00:23.124 --> 00:24.656
- Hello from limbo.

00:24.658 --> 00:27.125
- Adeline french's evidence
files have been scrambled.

00:27.261 --> 00:28.961
- So adeline has someone inside

00:29.096 --> 00:30.262
Covering her tracks.

00:30.264 --> 00:32.297
- Which means the oce
has a dirty cop.

00:32.333 --> 00:34.899
- The brigs legacy center
has a really nice ring to it,

00:34.935 --> 00:36.068
Don't you think?

00:36.203 --> 00:37.569
<i> - It's a youth job program</i>

00:37.605 --> 00:39.137
The deputy mayor set up to help.

00:40.474 --> 00:41.807
(squealing)

00:41.876 --> 00:44.342
- Were those the earrings
you were wearing?

00:44.378 --> 00:46.878
(laughing)
- always the sharp mind!

00:46.947 --> 00:48.080
(gasping)

00:48.215 --> 00:50.048
- A thumb drive
containing a virus

00:50.117 --> 00:52.117
Was found in your locker.

00:52.186 --> 00:55.420
I'll hand it over to
detectives lafford and harmon.

00:55.423 --> 00:57.489
- You're gonna have to surrender
your badge and your gun.

00:57.624 --> 00:59.324
- We have to suspend you.

00:59.326 --> 01:00.692
- If you think
she's a dirty cop,

01:00.761 --> 01:02.294
Then you're an even bigger
idiot than I thought.

01:02.296 --> 01:04.162
- You're on administrative leave
until further notice.

01:04.198 --> 01:07.032
- That's... With pleasure, sir.

01:07.167 --> 01:09.801
- Don't worry, your daughter's
not expecting you home.

01:23.383 --> 01:26.985
(gentle music)

01:29.657 --> 01:30.756
(knocking)

01:30.891 --> 01:33.291
- Hey, duff! Richie let me in.
Come on.

01:35.362 --> 01:36.528
Hey!

01:36.663 --> 01:38.197
You doing that thing
where you lie in the bed

01:38.199 --> 01:39.998
And you stare at the ceiling?
'cause I tell you something,

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
I know every crack and
water stain above my bed.

01:42.002 --> 01:44.069
But eventually,
you've got to get up...

01:44.071 --> 01:46.004
- Go away, I'm asleep.

01:46.006 --> 01:47.739
- I got breakfast sandwiches.

01:57.217 --> 01:58.617
(sighs)

01:59.987 --> 02:02.287
Food, it works every time.

02:02.323 --> 02:04.289
You know what I think?
I think the right sandwich

02:04.358 --> 02:08.326
Could topple an empire
or solve ancient differences.

02:11.031 --> 02:13.499
- Ugh! What the hell is this?
- That, uh...

02:13.634 --> 02:15.634
- I thought you were supposed
to get me a breakfast sandwich.

02:15.636 --> 02:17.402
- It is, it's a vegan
breakfast sandwich.

02:17.404 --> 02:19.704
That's like a bacon substitute.

02:19.773 --> 02:21.640
You wanna get that in you.
That's the good stuff.

02:21.709 --> 02:24.309
- No, thank you.
I'll make something later.

02:24.444 --> 02:26.311
It's not like I gotta rush
back to work.

02:26.446 --> 02:27.779
- Hey, guys.

02:27.848 --> 02:29.247
I got that job
with the private airport.

02:29.283 --> 02:30.983
- Hey!

02:31.118 --> 02:33.585
That's what I'm talking about!

02:33.720 --> 02:36.021
- Yeah, congratulations,
richie, that's amazing!

02:36.156 --> 02:38.924
- Thank you. I'm heading out
to cop some work shoes,

02:38.926 --> 02:40.526
I'm gonna be starting work
in a couple of days.

02:40.661 --> 02:42.193
I'll see you guys later.

02:42.229 --> 02:43.294
- Make me proud!

02:44.831 --> 02:47.332
And now, I don't even have
a job, 'cause I'm a corrupt cop.

02:47.334 --> 02:49.668
- Come on, anyone with half
a prefrontal cortex knows

02:49.803 --> 02:51.536
This is a set-up.
We just gotta prove it.

02:51.605 --> 02:53.605
Come on! We gotta get back
on the job.

02:53.607 --> 02:55.774
- Two problems with that:
Professional standards

02:55.776 --> 02:57.242
And unit commander michaels.

02:57.244 --> 02:58.843
- God, don't remind me.

02:58.913 --> 03:00.679
I wish shanks never left.

03:00.748 --> 03:02.681
This never would've happened
if she was there.

03:02.750 --> 03:06.018
- You're right.
- I am right.

03:06.153 --> 03:07.285
We've got to get her back.

03:10.290 --> 03:11.889
- Hey, woah, my man!

03:11.926 --> 03:14.859
Didn't I ask for two creams?
- Yeah, and I gave you two.

03:14.929 --> 03:17.295
- I watched you,
you put in one.

03:19.032 --> 03:21.967
- Have as a much cream
as you'd like, be my guest.

03:22.036 --> 03:23.201
(scoffs)

03:24.171 --> 03:26.037
- Yeah, whatever.

03:26.106 --> 03:27.239
(chuckling)

03:27.374 --> 03:29.307
So, y'all thought that
was funny?

03:29.376 --> 03:31.042
- It's all good, man.
Just don't shoot the guy

03:31.078 --> 03:32.511
Before I can get a muffin.
Okay?

03:32.513 --> 03:33.645
(chuckles)

03:33.780 --> 03:35.447
- Yeah, that's my bad,
that's my bad.

03:35.516 --> 03:38.450
My day is off to a crap start.
- Oh yeah?

03:38.452 --> 03:40.585
What happened to you?
- I thought I was out

03:40.621 --> 03:41.920
When kelly dumped me,

03:42.055 --> 03:44.656
But she's still finding ways
to mess with my life.

03:44.692 --> 03:47.058
Would you believe I had to use
a vacation day to come over here

03:47.127 --> 03:48.526
To meet with
professional standards

03:48.562 --> 03:50.795
Over something she did.
- That's always the way.

03:50.831 --> 03:51.797
But...

03:53.000 --> 03:56.134
Duff's in some hot ass water
from what I heard.

03:56.270 --> 03:58.736
- That's right. It's boiling.

03:59.406 --> 04:01.506
- You know what? Good.

04:03.143 --> 04:06.077
Everyone looked at me like
I was the devil when we split.

04:06.113 --> 04:08.347
I'm more than happy to watch
her get a taste of it.

04:08.349 --> 04:10.548
- Or, if you want,
let me throw this at you.

04:10.618 --> 04:12.450
You can give her a bigger taste.

04:13.520 --> 04:14.753
Maybe even the whole cake.
(clears throat)

04:16.156 --> 04:19.291
- Hey look, if we don't stick
together and trust each other,

04:19.360 --> 04:23.161
These females are gonna start
picking us off one at a time.

04:23.297 --> 04:25.297
- That's why you've got to beat
them at their own game.

04:25.366 --> 04:26.331
You hear me?

04:27.534 --> 04:28.833
- Okay, well come on,
fill me in.

04:33.874 --> 04:35.974
<i> - Man, these days,</i>
<i> sexual harassment</i>

04:36.109 --> 04:39.778
<i> Grinds anyone's career</i>
<i> to a halt, and it's perfect.</i>

04:39.847 --> 04:42.981
<i>Men are going down all the time,</i>
<i> so why not the women?</i>

04:43.116 --> 04:44.849
<i> - Nobody's gonna believe</i>
<i> that about kelly.</i>

04:46.119 --> 04:48.886
<i> - Really? They believed it</i>
<i> about shanks.</i>

04:49.923 --> 04:51.790
<i> - Wait, are you</i>
<i> telling me shanks</i>

04:51.792 --> 04:53.458
<i> Didn't actually harass you?</i>

04:55.562 --> 04:57.395
<i> - Look man, all I'm saying is</i>
<i> she didn't need to,</i>

04:58.665 --> 05:02.100
<i> I only needed to say she did,</i>
<i> that's the beauty.</i>

05:11.679 --> 05:12.744
- Thank you.

05:12.879 --> 05:14.779
- What did I tell you?

05:15.883 --> 05:19.084
No, I hear you ron,
but with all due respect,

05:19.153 --> 05:22.420
It did not take mcconnell
and davidson long to spill.

05:22.456 --> 05:25.890
You could've-- no, you could've
wrapped this up much quicker.

05:27.494 --> 05:29.027
Of course I understand
due process.

05:29.096 --> 05:30.962
As a matter of fact,
I'm considering

05:30.964 --> 05:32.764
A little due process of my own.

05:32.800 --> 05:34.699
I'm considering filing
a law suit about

05:34.735 --> 05:38.303
How this whole thing
was handled.

05:38.372 --> 05:40.705
No, no, no, think about it.

05:40.741 --> 05:45.110
A proud, gay, black woman
in a toxic work environment.

05:45.112 --> 05:47.646
No, I'm pretty sure
they're going to stand up

05:47.781 --> 05:49.180
And take notice.

05:49.216 --> 05:51.850
(laughs)

05:51.852 --> 05:53.384
No, I'm not joking.

05:53.420 --> 05:56.455
Yes, I do know how much
spicy paperwork

05:56.457 --> 05:57.923
It'll put on your desk.

05:58.058 --> 06:01.126
Okay, you know what, ron?
Oh, ron. No, ron!

06:01.195 --> 06:03.929
I hate doing this too.
So how about this.

06:04.064 --> 06:06.063
How about you reinstate me

06:06.100 --> 06:10.068
At oce today, we can talk
about it more calmly.

06:11.805 --> 06:12.837
Okay.

06:16.143 --> 06:17.476
(shouting)

06:17.478 --> 06:20.812
(rock music)

06:23.817 --> 06:28.352
Now, I have to dress and
get back to oce where I belong.

06:28.389 --> 06:31.223
- Ooh, first order
of business...

06:31.358 --> 06:35.226
Is that you get us reinstated,
right?

06:35.295 --> 06:37.095
So we can get back to oce.

06:37.230 --> 06:38.763
- Where we belong.
(together): Yay!

06:38.832 --> 06:40.898
- No. That's not how we do.

06:40.934 --> 06:42.534
- What do you mean?

06:42.669 --> 06:44.002
- You were suspended.

06:44.004 --> 06:46.037
You have your own due process
to go through.

06:46.106 --> 06:47.171
- Oh, come on, boss.

06:47.207 --> 06:48.907
You know I'm no mole
for the coyotes.

06:48.976 --> 06:51.843
- I do know that,
which is why I'm fully confident

06:51.978 --> 06:54.446
That once we go through
all the necessary steps,

06:54.581 --> 06:57.982
That you will be cleared.
- Me too, right?

06:58.018 --> 07:00.285
- Insubordination is
its own beast.

07:00.354 --> 07:03.188
- What do you mean? Come on!

07:03.190 --> 07:05.924
- Look, can you two please just
leave me in peace,

07:05.926 --> 07:09.928
And let me pack? I need to get
out of this godawful shirt.

07:09.997 --> 07:11.997
- What are we supposed to do?
Sit around, drink tea,

07:11.999 --> 07:14.132
Do our nails?
- Don't knock it,

07:14.201 --> 07:17.001
I've been indulging in myself
for six weeks.

07:17.070 --> 07:21.139
- Oh, boss! I do have a crown
attorney pal, bibby.

07:21.274 --> 07:22.807
- Yeah, I know bibby.
- So I asked her

07:22.843 --> 07:24.943
To find out which cop
got zorka farka's

07:24.945 --> 07:26.744
Fraud charges dropped last year.

07:26.780 --> 07:28.413
If zorka had a friend
on the force,

07:28.548 --> 07:31.883
Then it might be the same friend
that adeline's leaning on.

07:31.885 --> 07:33.285
- Okay, when she responds,
send it to me

07:33.420 --> 07:35.353
And I will take care of it.

07:35.389 --> 07:38.757
Now, the both of you go
indulge yourselves

07:38.892 --> 07:41.493
And remember who you are
without work.

07:43.563 --> 07:47.298
Unit commander shanks is back
in the saddle.

07:48.235 --> 07:50.168
Thank you, ladies.

07:50.237 --> 07:51.903
(chuckles)

07:59.379 --> 08:00.779
- Look at you, relaxing

08:00.914 --> 08:02.514
With professional standards
in the house.

08:02.649 --> 08:04.182
- This is not relaxing.

08:04.317 --> 08:06.217
I mean, how could michaels
think that duff

08:06.253 --> 08:07.652
Is wrapped up with the coyotes?

08:08.856 --> 08:10.988
- It's now somebody else's job
to look into that.

08:11.024 --> 08:12.390
But we can look into this.

08:14.394 --> 08:16.127
Tobin meyers.

08:16.129 --> 08:17.662
- Yeah, I recognize him from
adeline's party.

08:17.698 --> 08:21.399
- But we didn't have anything
on him. Until now.

08:21.401 --> 08:24.602
I reached out to jackie sullivan
to see if she heard anything.

08:24.738 --> 08:27.939
This guy's been recruiting kids
to transport empty suitcases.

08:27.975 --> 08:29.841
- I don't know, man.
I feel like this kid's

08:29.910 --> 08:31.409
Pretty low in the food chain.

08:31.411 --> 08:33.278
- There's nothing wrong
with working our way up.

08:33.347 --> 08:35.346
Especially now that all the big
dogs are either in the box,

08:35.415 --> 08:37.214
In the wind or in the--
- freezer.

08:37.251 --> 08:38.149
- Exactly.

08:39.953 --> 08:42.287
- Well, we could use a win
right about now.

08:42.856 --> 08:43.654
- Yeah.

08:44.358 --> 08:46.424
(light music)

08:54.034 --> 08:55.166
- Hello, brad.

08:56.503 --> 08:57.702
- Edwina?

08:57.837 --> 09:00.104
- Boss suits me fine.
I'm back.

09:00.140 --> 09:02.373
And if you don't mind,
I'd like my seat.

09:02.442 --> 09:03.441
- Uh...

09:06.013 --> 09:07.411
This is sudden.

09:08.215 --> 09:09.814
- Overdue is the way I'd put it,

09:09.816 --> 09:11.182
But I guess it's a matter
of perspective.

09:11.318 --> 09:15.253
And from where I'm standing,
you're still behind my desk.

09:16.023 --> 09:17.922
- Of course.
(chuckle)

09:17.925 --> 09:19.391
I only meant to ask

09:19.526 --> 09:22.894
For a moment to put in
a call to hill to...

09:24.731 --> 09:25.864
...Gather my things.

09:25.866 --> 09:27.465
- Ron's expecting your call.

09:27.534 --> 09:29.200
And guns and gangs could use
your focus.

09:29.236 --> 09:31.135
And as for your things,

09:31.171 --> 09:32.904
What do you say to an hour?

09:32.973 --> 09:35.873
That's about as much time as it
took you to move in here, right?

09:36.610 --> 09:37.676
- An hour sounds perfect.

09:38.312 --> 09:39.176
- Great.

09:40.280 --> 09:42.080
Looking forward to working
with you again,

09:42.082 --> 09:43.981
Detective sergeant.

09:57.531 --> 10:00.031
- Would you care for a cloth
soaked in ice and eucalyptus?

10:00.166 --> 10:02.366
- Oh, yes.
- Oh, my god!

10:02.402 --> 10:03.835
Are you gonna start
feeding us grapes?

10:03.904 --> 10:06.638
(laughing)
I'm joking, I'm joking.

10:06.773 --> 10:09.774
It's just, I feel like dionysus,
lounging over here and stuff.

10:09.909 --> 10:10.975
- Shh.

10:11.011 --> 10:12.277
- Yeah, sorry.

10:15.849 --> 10:17.115
(sighing)

10:17.985 --> 10:19.384
(phone chimes)

10:19.386 --> 10:20.852
Hey, you're supposed to leave
that in your locker.

10:20.921 --> 10:23.421
- I know, I forgot.
I just... I'll ignore it.

10:24.891 --> 10:26.991
- What if it's bibby,
the crown prosecutor?

10:26.994 --> 10:30.928
Maybe she found out who wanted
to drop zorka's charges.

10:30.964 --> 10:33.665
- Yeah, I know,
I'll check later. Okay?

10:33.800 --> 10:36.934
I'm still in my chill vibe.
- Yep, yep. Me too, so chill.

10:36.936 --> 10:38.936
- So chill.
- Oh, I'm so relaxed.

10:38.972 --> 10:40.138
I can't handle it.

10:40.207 --> 10:41.605
(phone chimes)

10:41.642 --> 10:44.342
- Although, I could turn
the ringer off.

10:44.411 --> 10:46.277
- If you're going to the ringer,
might as well just...

10:46.279 --> 10:48.946
(overlapping chatter)

10:48.982 --> 10:50.148
What does it say?

10:52.753 --> 10:53.951
- Beauchamp.

10:53.987 --> 10:55.754
- Gabrielle? What?

10:58.158 --> 10:59.557
Why would she try
to pin this on you?

11:01.361 --> 11:02.961
- I mean, I can think
of a few reasons.

11:03.096 --> 11:05.563
- Oh come on, nathan?
That's extreme jealousy.

11:05.599 --> 11:08.166
- But I was also responsible
for her getting shot.

11:08.301 --> 11:11.369
- Not really. But if she is
involved with the coyotes,

11:11.438 --> 11:13.371
Maybe she's not the sweet
innocent person we thought.

11:13.506 --> 11:15.540
- You know, I did catch her
snooping though

11:15.675 --> 11:17.875
Michaels' desk the other day,
and it was hella suspicious.

11:18.912 --> 11:21.179
But if she's working
for the coyotes,

11:21.248 --> 11:22.580
Why would they try
and shoot her?

11:22.649 --> 11:24.449
- Maybe they wanted gabrielle
to shut up.

11:24.584 --> 11:28.253
- Mm-hmm. I think we oughta pay
gabrielle a visit.

11:37.431 --> 11:39.330
- We have a few interviews
offsite,

11:39.332 --> 11:40.598
So we're heading out
for the day.

11:40.667 --> 11:42.767
Will you be here tomorrow?
- Absolutely.

11:47.340 --> 11:50.775
(mysterious music)

12:15.302 --> 12:16.568
- Brad.

12:16.703 --> 12:17.702
- Yeah?

12:17.771 --> 12:19.570
- What are you doing?

12:19.606 --> 12:22.006
- Detective lafford asked me
to drop off this report,

12:22.008 --> 12:24.842
So I'm right here,
dropping it off.

12:26.179 --> 12:27.779
- A report on what exactly?

12:27.781 --> 12:32.183
- I'll let... Ps loop you in
on that, boss.

12:32.252 --> 12:34.385
Wouldn't want to break
protocol,

12:34.387 --> 12:36.988
Not under such scrutinizing
circumstances.

12:37.057 --> 12:38.722
- Thanks for the reminder.

12:41.561 --> 12:43.928
- Excuse me, I'm just gonna
run some stuff out to my car,

12:43.997 --> 12:45.663
You know, downsizing.

12:45.732 --> 12:47.398
- I trust that's
the last of it.

12:47.534 --> 12:49.534
- Yeah. It's all yours.

12:56.943 --> 12:58.876
(dramatic music)

13:00.213 --> 13:01.345
(car beeps)

13:15.662 --> 13:16.660
(sighing)

13:19.900 --> 13:21.299
Balls, balls, balls, balls!

13:26.439 --> 13:27.905
(dialing)

13:30.043 --> 13:31.109
Hello.

13:32.245 --> 13:34.645
I have a copy of the file.

13:36.115 --> 13:39.317
Adeline's last means
of blackmailing the cartel

13:39.386 --> 13:41.719
Is literally in my fingers.

13:42.989 --> 13:47.325
Grubby? Need I remind you
if these grubby fingers

13:47.460 --> 13:49.527
Hadn't scrambled that drive,

13:49.662 --> 13:51.962
The cartel would go down
and so would you.

13:53.066 --> 13:55.132
I'm gonna take you up
on that job offer.

13:55.168 --> 13:56.801
I'm assuming it's still
on the table.

13:58.805 --> 14:00.404
Head of security.

14:01.441 --> 14:02.339
That's right.

14:03.810 --> 14:05.643
Oh, and have we located
adeline yet?

14:07.080 --> 14:10.214
- Kind of arrogant when
you think about it, flight.

14:10.217 --> 14:14.084
We pack into oversized
mascara tubes at 30,000 feet.

14:14.120 --> 14:16.821
Just a few inches of metal
between us and the universe.

14:16.956 --> 14:18.590
Human resilience in action.

14:19.826 --> 14:20.925
Or stupidity.

14:21.895 --> 14:22.960
Or both.

14:22.996 --> 14:26.431
- Okay, okay. Judy.
You talk so much.

14:26.433 --> 14:28.499
I just thought you'd be
a better listener, okay?

14:28.568 --> 14:31.169
- I don't have my blood pressure
medication, it makes me jittery.

14:31.304 --> 14:32.737
(knocking)

14:38.712 --> 14:40.578
- What are you doing baby, huh?

14:40.713 --> 14:42.647
It's like you want them
to find you!

14:42.716 --> 14:44.782
(laughs)
word is out now.

14:45.785 --> 14:48.352
The general sees you
as a liability.

14:49.456 --> 14:51.956
Now, I've got your passports
and your new ids,

14:52.091 --> 14:53.524
But we gotta smart about it.

14:53.660 --> 14:55.460
- Okay, so what's the price
on my head?

14:55.595 --> 14:58.463
Like 200,000?

14:58.598 --> 15:00.198
300?

15:00.200 --> 15:04.068
- The rumour is 50 for you
and 100 for the thumb drive.

15:05.171 --> 15:08.138
- What? How budget.

15:08.174 --> 15:10.541
- Hey! How are we gonna escape

15:10.610 --> 15:13.210
With every coyote
on the lookout for you?

15:13.212 --> 15:15.413
We're supposed to get out
of this together.

15:15.482 --> 15:19.884
- I am so very serious about us.

15:20.019 --> 15:21.919
- We need to find a way
out of here.

15:21.955 --> 15:22.954
- We have a way.

15:24.157 --> 15:26.958
Right over...

15:28.161 --> 15:29.526
...There.

15:31.298 --> 15:32.329
(sighs)

15:33.366 --> 15:34.766
- I can't have anything nice.

15:35.335 --> 15:36.267
- Come here.

15:37.703 --> 15:40.237
Told you, use your finger pads
when you open up the locker.

15:40.273 --> 15:41.039
- I know.

15:42.275 --> 15:44.108
Do you think gabrielle's home?

15:44.177 --> 15:45.910
- Well, she's not at work.
Where are we

15:45.912 --> 15:48.412
When we're not at work?
- Home.

15:48.448 --> 15:49.646
But she's more balanced
than us.

15:49.683 --> 15:50.881
- There's no way she's balanced.

15:50.951 --> 15:52.549
(chuckles)
- true.

15:53.954 --> 15:55.453
Jogging's pretty balanced.

15:55.522 --> 15:56.988
- Oh. Yep.

16:03.229 --> 16:04.462
- Oh, hey!
- Hey.

16:04.464 --> 16:06.263
- How's it going?
- Good.

16:06.299 --> 16:08.532
We were just driving by
and we saw you, so.

16:08.601 --> 16:10.534
- Funny, 'cause I saw
your car park there

16:10.570 --> 16:12.270
About half an hour ago.

16:12.405 --> 16:14.672
- We were driving by,
we thought it was you,
but then it wasn't,

16:14.674 --> 16:16.407
And now we think,
"oh my gosh, maybe it was you."

16:16.443 --> 16:17.909
- We just wanted
to come and talk

16:17.911 --> 16:19.811
About a few things. That's it.

16:19.946 --> 16:21.379
- You were both suspended.

16:21.448 --> 16:24.014
I can't discuss work with you.
- And that's cool.

16:24.050 --> 16:25.549
I just want to make sure
that everything between

16:25.585 --> 16:26.351
Me and you is alright.

16:27.487 --> 16:28.419
- Like you don't hold a grudge
against her

16:28.455 --> 16:29.920
Because of nathan
or anything like that...

16:33.593 --> 16:35.826
- Nathan and I have our own
reasons for breaking up

16:35.895 --> 16:37.495
That have nothing to do
with you.

16:37.564 --> 16:39.396
- Okay, um...

16:40.566 --> 16:41.566
Look, I saw you going
through michaels' desk,

16:41.568 --> 16:42.433
What was that about?

16:45.438 --> 16:48.773
- Why am I being interrogated?
By two suspended cops no less.

16:48.775 --> 16:50.774
- You're not being interrogated
gabrielle, okay?

16:52.178 --> 16:54.378
But someone scrambled
that hard drive.

16:54.447 --> 16:56.780
And I think it's the same person
that had the charges

16:56.816 --> 16:58.382
Against zorka farkas dropped.

16:58.451 --> 16:59.716
Do you know who that
could've been?

16:59.753 --> 17:00.684
- 'cause we do.

17:05.992 --> 17:08.593
- I was pressured into having
those charges dropped.

17:08.595 --> 17:09.460
Okay?

17:10.597 --> 17:12.997
And I didn't feel great
about it at the time.

17:13.132 --> 17:14.999
And then, with this
investigation,

17:15.068 --> 17:17.468
No indiscretion is too small.

17:17.470 --> 17:19.336
I started to feel really weird
about it.

17:19.338 --> 17:20.604
- Who pressured you to do it?

17:22.776 --> 17:23.574
- Brad.

17:24.244 --> 17:25.810
When we were dating.

17:27.213 --> 17:30.148
He told me she was
an important informant.

17:30.283 --> 17:32.083
- Why couldn't he do
that himself?

17:32.085 --> 17:33.284
- He wouldn't say.

17:33.353 --> 17:35.753
Lately, he's been
hovering around me.

17:35.755 --> 17:37.955
I thought it was because
he was still interested,

17:38.024 --> 17:39.957
But I'm starting to think
he's making sure

17:40.026 --> 17:41.358
I'm not talking.

17:41.428 --> 17:43.160
Once I realized zorka

17:43.229 --> 17:45.663
Was connected to will
and adeline,

17:45.665 --> 17:47.031
I stopped sleeping.

17:47.166 --> 17:50.701
- So you're saying that michaels
is the coyote connect?

17:50.737 --> 17:54.705
- I'm saying brad has got a hell
of a lot more answers than I do.

17:56.876 --> 17:58.509
<i> - Sergeant beauchamp,</i>

17:58.545 --> 18:00.444
<i> You must know</i>
<i> your romantic history</i>

18:00.513 --> 18:01.979
<i>With detective sergeant michaels</i>

18:02.048 --> 18:03.581
<i> Makes this a little</i>
<i> more complex.</i>

18:03.650 --> 18:05.516
<i> - I understand, detective.</i>

18:05.518 --> 18:08.252
<i> - Do you have anything</i>
<i> to corroborate your claims</i>

18:08.321 --> 18:09.720
<i> That you got zorka farkas'</i>
<i> charges dropped</i>

18:09.722 --> 18:11.389
<i> On behalf of michaels?</i>

18:11.391 --> 18:14.725
<i> - No. But I have never had</i>
<i> any personal connection</i>

18:14.861 --> 18:16.727
<i> With zorka or her kids.</i>

18:16.796 --> 18:18.529
<i> And if you start looking,</i>
<i> I'm pretty sure</i>

18:18.664 --> 18:20.598
<i> You'll find out michaels did.</i>

18:20.733 --> 18:23.467
<i> I know you still need</i>
<i> to verify my statement,</i>

18:23.503 --> 18:25.269
<i> But I was just doing my job.</i>
(sighs)

18:30.009 --> 18:30.775
- Well.

18:33.146 --> 18:33.945
I can't quite believe it.

18:34.080 --> 18:35.879
- Right? It's crazy!

18:35.915 --> 18:37.114
- Hm.

18:37.249 --> 18:38.983
- Did ps bring in michaels yet?

18:39.118 --> 18:40.618
- Nope.
- Why not?

18:40.687 --> 18:44.021
- Don't know. They have to play
this one right, I guess.

18:44.023 --> 18:45.422
- Have they suspended him
at least?

18:45.458 --> 18:47.758
- Didn't have to.
He left a resignation letter

18:47.894 --> 18:48.993
On my desk two hours ago.

18:49.128 --> 18:51.362
Michaels has left the building.

18:51.431 --> 18:53.664
- Well, if that doesn't
say guilty, I don't know
what does.

18:53.733 --> 18:55.433
- Girl...
- Okay, please, boss.

18:55.568 --> 18:58.636
We really need to get back
on the job. Please.

18:58.705 --> 19:01.572
- Or do you want to leave guns
and gangs to watts and company?

19:02.808 --> 19:04.241
Come on, you can't be serious.

19:04.310 --> 19:05.542
Michaels totally pinned
this on me!

19:07.647 --> 19:09.914
- I already talked to hill
and the guys upstairs.

19:09.916 --> 19:12.049
I need you two on the job.

19:12.085 --> 19:13.717
Now, more than ever.

19:14.854 --> 19:16.854
- Thank you!
- Mm-hmm.

19:16.989 --> 19:19.189
- Yes! Yes!

19:20.927 --> 19:22.459
- The old way. No, the old way.
- Yes!

19:23.296 --> 19:26.063
(shouting)

19:26.065 --> 19:27.465
- Okay, so what now?

19:27.600 --> 19:29.467
- Well, if we can figure out
the coyotes' next move,

19:29.469 --> 19:31.402
We might be able to clarify
michaels' role in all this.

19:31.471 --> 19:33.671
- Any new leads?
- Yeah, we put a spin team

19:33.740 --> 19:34.939
On tobin meyers,

19:34.941 --> 19:38.676
Aka the coyotes' chemist,
aka hazmat.

19:38.811 --> 19:40.678
- Hey, that's the same van
hazmat was loading outside

19:40.747 --> 19:42.679
Will's port credit drug
lab property!

19:42.715 --> 19:44.749
- Yeah, the guy's same height,
same little rat stature.

19:44.751 --> 19:46.149
- Let me see this.

19:47.420 --> 19:48.819
- You know them?

19:48.821 --> 19:50.621
We didn't get any hits
on the data base.

19:50.623 --> 19:52.890
- It's dane owens
from marshall court.

19:53.025 --> 19:55.492
Richie said his friends were
involved in something shady.

19:55.528 --> 19:57.895
- Right now, those kids are
the best leads we have.

19:59.599 --> 20:02.099
(rhythmic music)

20:04.036 --> 20:06.270
- I know it's a bit
different here than in
the private airports.

20:07.373 --> 20:09.240
We get the suitcases in bins
like that one.

20:09.375 --> 20:10.941
And we wheel them on the plane.

20:12.111 --> 20:13.511
- Okay. That's cool.

20:13.646 --> 20:15.713
So, is it just us two
on shift today?

20:15.715 --> 20:18.248
- Oh, no. Most of team started
last week.

20:19.452 --> 20:22.586
Hey, tobin. I got another one
here for you.

20:22.589 --> 20:25.189
- Yo, richie.
You're in this now too?

20:25.324 --> 20:26.790
I thought you were
too good for us.

20:27.794 --> 20:30.228
- You richie clarke?
- Yeah.

20:30.363 --> 20:32.696
- You'll be working with him.
- Yeah!

20:32.765 --> 20:34.665
- Alright.
Everybody get to work.

20:36.603 --> 20:40.071
(♪)

20:50.883 --> 20:53.150
Ave been gone
for three days.

20:53.219 --> 20:55.019
Why don't you call me back?

20:55.088 --> 20:57.587
Aren't you the one who prides
herself on prompt replies?

20:58.691 --> 21:01.092
I'm getting worried.
Call me back.

21:07.399 --> 21:08.398
(phone chimes)

21:10.703 --> 21:12.502
<i> - Hi, sweetie. I'm having</i>

21:12.538 --> 21:15.239
<i> A blast in saint anne's.</i>
<i> It's great up here,</i>

21:15.241 --> 21:16.574
<i> Even though I ate two pieces</i>
<i> of apple pie</i>

21:16.709 --> 21:17.774
<i> And almost threw up.</i>

21:17.810 --> 21:18.976
<i> Remember that time</i>
<i> we were staying</i>

21:19.045 --> 21:20.777
<i> In that horrible hotel,</i>
<i> and you threw up</i>

21:20.813 --> 21:23.114
<i> Eating apple pie because</i>
<i> the ice cream was rancid?</i>

21:23.249 --> 21:24.448
(laughing)

21:24.583 --> 21:26.817
<i> Ah, dreamy days, weren't they?</i>

21:28.053 --> 21:32.255
<i> Anyway, I'll be home soon,</i>
<i> okay? Bye, sammy.</i>

21:34.594 --> 21:35.926
- Sammy?

21:44.403 --> 21:46.737
Hey, you don't sound like
yourself. What's going on?

21:46.773 --> 21:48.539
Can you call me back?

21:48.608 --> 21:50.874
And why is your phone going
straight to voicemail?

21:53.212 --> 21:54.778
Hey, hey, hey.

21:55.782 --> 21:56.881
- What's wrong with you?

21:56.883 --> 21:58.215
- My mom went
to saint anne's spa,

21:58.284 --> 22:00.618
I don't know what room she's in
or who she's with.

22:00.753 --> 22:02.620
- You know, she probably just
needs a break from you.

22:02.622 --> 22:04.488
- These past few months,
all she can do is guilt-trip me

22:04.623 --> 22:06.090
'cause I don't spend
enough time with her.

22:06.225 --> 22:08.558
- She's probably just trying
to make you miss her.
You know how they do.

22:08.594 --> 22:10.494
- In the message,
she called me "sammy".

22:11.564 --> 22:13.164
She hates when people
call me sammy.

22:13.299 --> 22:15.633
- Maybe she's needling you.
- Yeah, maybe.

22:15.768 --> 22:17.300
Yeah, yeah.
- Okay, sorry.

22:20.406 --> 22:21.739
- So, judes.

22:21.808 --> 22:23.641
What was the hidden message
in your message?

22:23.643 --> 22:25.175
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

22:25.211 --> 22:26.777
I did exactly what you asked.

22:26.779 --> 22:30.648
- I didn't ask you to talk
about apple pie and throwing up.

22:30.783 --> 22:34.385
- I was rambling.
I don't have my pills.

22:34.387 --> 22:38.055
Combined with being kidnapped
gives me verbal diarrhea, okay?

22:38.190 --> 22:40.724
- Hey, nicky noodles,
do you have that phone

22:40.793 --> 22:42.326
I asked you to get?
- Yeah, babe.

22:42.461 --> 22:43.794
- I need you to film us.

22:48.334 --> 22:49.966
- Alright, smile.

22:52.671 --> 22:53.637
(gasps)

22:57.110 --> 22:58.609
(phone vibrating)

23:02.014 --> 23:05.282
- Hey, richie. You good?

23:05.351 --> 23:08.618
- Yeah, I'm at that new job,
terminal v. But something's up.

23:08.654 --> 23:10.320
- Whoa, what's going on?

23:10.356 --> 23:12.155
- You know that cop,
the one who tried

23:12.191 --> 23:14.491
To frame me for the shooting?
He's here.

23:14.527 --> 23:17.627
- Michaels?
Michaels is at the airport?

23:17.663 --> 23:21.765
- Yes. I mean,
it's not just him.

23:21.834 --> 23:23.700
Dane, some marshall court kids.

23:23.770 --> 23:25.169
Last time I checked,
they were all trying

23:25.171 --> 23:26.437
To get in on some hustle.

23:26.439 --> 23:28.239
<i> Something suss is</i>
<i> definitely going on.</i>

23:29.175 --> 23:30.841
- Okay, richie, listen to me.

23:30.877 --> 23:33.043
You need to get out
of there now.

23:34.580 --> 23:35.779
- What if I'm over reacting?

23:35.815 --> 23:38.115
- No, no, no, no, no.
Listen to me, richie.

23:38.250 --> 23:39.950
This may be connected
to the coyotes.

23:40.019 --> 23:43.053
<i> And if it this,</i>
<i> it is not worth it, okay?</i>

23:43.122 --> 23:46.190
- Yeah. Yeah, I hear you.

23:50.930 --> 23:53.129
- So terminal v,
or whatever they call it,

23:53.166 --> 23:54.131
Is michaels new gig?

23:54.200 --> 23:55.933
- It's all connected.

23:55.935 --> 23:57.735
Michaels's doing favours
for the coyotes,

23:57.870 --> 23:59.136
And now he's working
at the airport.

23:59.271 --> 24:01.672
We know that those kids
are working for tobin,

24:01.741 --> 24:04.608
Who's the key player in
distributing the coyotes' coke.

24:04.743 --> 24:06.644
And now, they're working
at the airport.

24:06.779 --> 24:10.413
It only makes sense that this
vip terminal is the coyotes'

24:10.450 --> 24:12.016
New way of smuggling
in pink coke.

24:12.018 --> 24:14.885
- Okay, so everything about
this gang says no hierarchy,

24:14.954 --> 24:17.621
But there is definitely somebody
in charge of this airport.

24:17.623 --> 24:19.490
They knew exactly what they were
doing when they hired michaels.

24:20.726 --> 24:22.826
Hey, detective wazowski.
Armstrong couldn't find you,

24:22.895 --> 24:24.728
Said some guy left this for you
at the front desk.

24:24.730 --> 24:25.529
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

24:29.435 --> 24:33.570
(indistinct chatter)

24:39.378 --> 24:40.343
(gasps)

24:45.918 --> 24:46.917
- Give me a minute.

24:47.620 --> 24:50.887
Hey, sam? Sam! Wait up!

25:00.066 --> 25:02.266
Sam, what's going on?
- Oh nothing, I'm...

25:02.335 --> 25:04.401
I'm just feeling
a little bit queasy.

25:04.470 --> 25:06.537
- Sam--
- no, I just need...

25:06.672 --> 25:09.839
Duff, I just need a minute.
- What the hell is going on?

25:10.476 --> 25:11.876
- Okay.

25:12.011 --> 25:13.877
But you have to swear
on your whole family

25:13.946 --> 25:15.212
You will not say anything.

25:15.281 --> 25:16.413
- Okay.
- Okay.

25:19.218 --> 25:21.085
- What?
- I can't take it.

25:21.220 --> 25:22.285
I don't know what to do.

25:22.321 --> 25:23.487
- We need to alert
someone right now.

25:23.622 --> 25:24.688
- No, stop!

25:25.824 --> 25:28.292
Stop. You swore,
you can't tell anybody.

25:28.294 --> 25:31.395
Wait, stop, she left a note,
she left this note.

25:34.133 --> 25:35.833
- Sam, we have to tell them.

25:35.835 --> 25:38.768
- Look at the phone.
She left this phone.

25:38.804 --> 25:39.970
She's gonna call me.

25:40.105 --> 25:41.638
- We don't have time to wait
for her to--

25:41.674 --> 25:43.006
(phone rings)

25:48.080 --> 25:49.046
- Okay.

25:51.050 --> 25:52.049
- Take a deep breath.

25:53.286 --> 25:54.384
Deep breath.

25:57.657 --> 26:00.390
- Hi, sammy, it's me.
It's balda.

26:00.459 --> 26:01.659
- Where's my mother?

26:01.661 --> 26:03.060
- She's with me.

26:04.330 --> 26:05.729
You know, when I found out
that you and your partner

26:05.731 --> 26:06.863
Were very determined
to bring me down,

26:06.899 --> 26:08.532
I had to find leverage
against you

26:08.667 --> 26:10.067
And your mother was so...

26:10.069 --> 26:12.936
Desperate for friends,
it just made her an easy target.

26:13.005 --> 26:15.406
- Is she okay?
<i> - Isn't it funny how</i>

26:15.408 --> 26:18.375
You bonded with my mother
and now I'm bonding with yours?

26:19.178 --> 26:20.744
<i> Of course, you...</i>

26:20.746 --> 26:22.712
Screwed my mother over
and locked her up.

26:22.748 --> 26:25.549
And I'm usually a tit for tat
kind of girl, but...

26:25.684 --> 26:28.719
If you do what I ask, I'm gonna
make sure your mom's fine.

26:28.854 --> 26:32.222
- Is she taking her
blood pressure medication?

26:32.291 --> 26:35.291
- Oh, uh... No.

26:36.596 --> 26:38.762
Sadly, I think that's why she's
seeming a little bit off.

26:38.831 --> 26:40.430
<i> But as soon as you get me</i>

26:40.499 --> 26:42.566
Out of this country,
I'm gonna tell you exactly

26:42.568 --> 26:44.434
<i> Where she is.</i>
- How?

26:44.470 --> 26:46.336
I can't do that.

26:46.339 --> 26:49.172
- I need you to put it in the
system that I've been arrested.

26:49.208 --> 26:51.508
And then, word's gonna spread
amongst the coyotes,

26:51.544 --> 26:53.711
<i> They're gonna go underground</i>
<i> in a panic,</i>

26:53.846 --> 26:55.912
<i> Thinking that I'm talking,</i>

26:55.914 --> 26:57.581
And they'll be far too worried
to kind of notice me

26:57.650 --> 27:01.385
Slipping out of the country,
like a cute little sneaky mouse.

27:01.387 --> 27:03.654
- I can't make it look
like I arrested you.

27:05.124 --> 27:06.723
I'm gonna have to bring you
in and parade you

27:06.792 --> 27:08.392
In front of the officer
in charge.

27:08.461 --> 27:10.593
They'll put you in the system,
then I could let you go after--

27:10.630 --> 27:12.262
<i> - No, not coming</i>
<i> into the station.</i>

27:12.298 --> 27:15.265
Just figure it out,
and then once it's in there,

27:15.301 --> 27:16.800
The coyotes will know,

27:16.935 --> 27:19.803
And in case you haven't noticed,
they have people everywhere.

27:19.938 --> 27:23.407
Oh, and I need you to do it
within the next three hours.

27:23.409 --> 27:24.407
- Adeline, please.

27:25.945 --> 27:27.277
Just let my mother go.

27:27.413 --> 27:29.012
- Tit for tat, sammy.

27:30.449 --> 27:32.416
And tell nobody

27:32.418 --> 27:33.884
Or she's gonna die.

27:33.886 --> 27:35.018
(whimpering)

27:36.922 --> 27:40.123
(whimpering)

27:41.360 --> 27:44.695
- Sam, we gotta at least bring
the guys in on this.

27:44.764 --> 27:46.163
We can't do this on our own.

27:46.232 --> 27:47.764
- Adeline killed
her own brother,

27:47.800 --> 27:50.300
She will kill my mother in a
heartbeat if we give her reason.

27:50.302 --> 27:51.969
I shouldn't have told you.
I shouldn't have done that.

27:52.104 --> 27:53.771
But I did. And now,
you are in this with me,

27:53.906 --> 27:56.973
But you promised.
- Okay, okay.

27:57.043 --> 27:59.443
(tense music)

28:08.454 --> 28:10.387
- Hey hanlon, how's it going?

28:10.522 --> 28:12.990
- I'm starving.
Haven't had lunch.

28:13.125 --> 28:14.057
- Go get lunch.

28:14.126 --> 28:16.593
- I'll wait till
I get some relief.

28:16.629 --> 28:19.196
- Well, relief's here.
Right here.

28:19.265 --> 28:21.465
- Uh, that's okay.

28:25.237 --> 28:27.671
- I'm serious.
Listen, to be honest,

28:27.740 --> 28:29.740
I came here to avoid a guy
that I'm dating,

28:29.809 --> 28:32.408
Or like, was dating.
It's just super claustrophobic,

28:32.445 --> 28:34.545
So listen, take 10 minutes,
go grab a sandwich,

28:34.680 --> 28:36.579
I got you.
- Okay.

28:37.616 --> 28:39.116
Thanks, wazowski.
- Yeah.

28:39.118 --> 28:41.284
- And people say
you're not cool.

28:44.590 --> 28:48.758
(mysterious music)

28:50.296 --> 28:52.829
- 8-4-6-2. 8-4-6-2. Okay.

29:20.760 --> 29:22.993
(♪)

29:31.670 --> 29:33.036
I'm officially corrupt.

29:34.072 --> 29:35.605
- No, you're not.

29:35.641 --> 29:36.973
- I am.

29:38.210 --> 29:39.342
Probably will get fired.

29:40.646 --> 29:42.145
There'll be criminal charges.

29:43.415 --> 29:45.682
- Sam, you acted under duress,
it won't go that far.

29:45.718 --> 29:47.417
- When my mom said she was going
to saint anne's,

29:47.486 --> 29:48.819
I should've asked more
questions, but...

29:51.557 --> 29:55.391
I was just so happy
that she was out of my hair.

29:58.564 --> 29:59.762
(sighs)

30:02.101 --> 30:05.268
- Sam, a watched phone
never rings. Okay?

30:09.575 --> 30:12.442
And a chipped nail should never
see the light of day.

30:12.578 --> 30:13.543
(sighing)

30:22.588 --> 30:25.989
Hmm? Nothing looks dumber...

30:27.326 --> 30:29.726
Than a detective
wearing chip nails.

30:29.728 --> 30:31.128
- I don't care.
- Give it to me.

30:31.263 --> 30:32.129
Yes, I know you don't care.

30:32.264 --> 30:33.430
- It won't match.

30:35.034 --> 30:37.967
It won't match.
- Hey, hey, hey.

30:39.405 --> 30:41.671
Yes, it will. Okay?

30:41.707 --> 30:44.307
'cause I bought it at the spa.

30:46.812 --> 30:48.478
Alright, just take
a deep breath.

30:49.615 --> 30:52.949
(breathing shakily)

30:53.085 --> 30:54.918
Relax, alright?

30:57.422 --> 31:01.291
Alright. Look at that.
Better, right?

31:01.426 --> 31:03.160
- It's better.
- Okay.

31:03.162 --> 31:04.428
- Okay.

31:04.563 --> 31:06.129
- Now, walk me through
your mom's message.

31:07.399 --> 31:08.598
- Okay, uh...

31:10.336 --> 31:12.635
She said nothing really, that...

31:12.671 --> 31:14.504
She said she was fine,
and called me sammy.

31:14.506 --> 31:16.106
- Okay, but...

31:17.643 --> 31:19.042
That told you something
was wrong,

31:19.177 --> 31:20.443
'cause she never
calls you sammy.

31:21.447 --> 31:23.246
So, she was sending you
a message.

31:23.315 --> 31:24.314
What else did it say?

31:24.383 --> 31:25.949
- Uh...

31:29.588 --> 31:30.387
(sighs)

31:31.723 --> 31:34.791
<i> - Hi, sweetie. I'm having</i>
<i> a blast in saint anne's.</i>

31:34.860 --> 31:37.127
<i>It's great up here, even though</i>
<i> I ate two pieces of apple pie</i>

31:37.196 --> 31:38.795
<i> And almost threw up.</i>
<i> Remember that time</i>

31:38.797 --> 31:40.530
<i> We were staying</i>
<i> in that horrible hotel,</i>

31:40.599 --> 31:41.865
<i> And you threw up</i>
<i> eating apple pie</i>

31:42.000 --> 31:43.766
<i> Because the ice cream</i>
<i> was rancid?</i>

31:43.802 --> 31:45.134
(laughing)

31:45.170 --> 31:47.470
<i> Ah, dreamy days, weren't they?</i>

31:48.307 --> 31:50.941
<i>Anyway, I'll be home soon, okay?</i>

31:51.010 --> 31:52.876
<i> Bye, sammy.</i>

31:52.945 --> 31:55.078
- Is there anything to that?

31:55.114 --> 31:58.481
- Uh, nothing. I mean,
I don't think so. I don't know.

31:58.517 --> 32:00.283
It's just my mom rambling.

32:00.319 --> 32:04.821
- But what about that memory.
Was it weird or out of place?

32:04.823 --> 32:06.023
Anything about it?

32:07.392 --> 32:11.627
- Okay, I was a kid. Our flight
got delayed, and then...

32:11.664 --> 32:14.097
We stayed at this really
crappy hotel near the airport.

32:15.367 --> 32:16.666
- Where did you stay?

32:17.836 --> 32:19.369
- I don't know.
- Come on, sam. Think about it.

32:19.405 --> 32:20.637
- I don't know.

32:20.772 --> 32:23.072
- I know, but just...
- Okay, okay. I'll just--

32:26.845 --> 32:29.078
Holiday home hotel.

32:29.848 --> 32:31.014
Yeah.

32:32.451 --> 32:35.986
She said that she would never
stay in another holiday home.

32:36.055 --> 32:37.587
- Holiday home hotel.

32:37.723 --> 32:39.923
- Yeah.
- Okay,

32:39.925 --> 32:41.992
Let's start there.
- Yeah.

32:41.994 --> 32:44.560
- Okay. Holiday home.

32:45.731 --> 32:48.531
It doesn't exist anymore.
Now it's called...

32:48.600 --> 32:50.133
Dreamstate inn.

32:50.268 --> 32:54.004
- Dreamstate inn.
Oh, dreamy days!

32:54.006 --> 32:56.139
That's what she said in
her message. Do you remember?

32:56.274 --> 32:57.407
Dreamy days.

32:58.977 --> 33:02.012
- Dreamstate inn.

33:03.482 --> 33:07.217
Hotel said two women matching
adeline and judy's descriptions

33:07.219 --> 33:09.085
Checked in under the name
jillian wood.

33:09.121 --> 33:12.355
- Hey, I need to talk to you.
- Not now, something came up.

33:12.391 --> 33:13.690
- Are you okay?

33:14.960 --> 33:16.993
Hey, need some help?
- Not now, len.

33:20.165 --> 33:22.298
- Kelly, you're worrying me!

33:27.139 --> 33:31.307
- Yes, of course I'm interested
in the superintendent promotion.

33:32.978 --> 33:35.912
And yes, I'm more than happy
to attend the seminar,

33:35.981 --> 33:40.183
But we're actually in the middle
of a really big investigation

33:40.318 --> 33:42.285
Right now, and I just got back.

33:43.889 --> 33:47.924
Oh, we arrested adeline french--
yes. Yes, of course,

33:47.993 --> 33:50.159
Yes, we arrested adeline french.

33:51.330 --> 33:55.999
Okay! Well, great. Thanks.
Bye. Count me in. Bye.

34:02.274 --> 34:05.041
Oh, hey, we arrested
adeline french?

34:05.176 --> 34:05.875
- Who?

34:05.911 --> 34:06.909
Okay.

34:08.480 --> 34:11.214
Where are sam and kelly?
- I don't know, boss.

34:11.349 --> 34:13.784
- Apparently, someone
just arrested adeline french,

34:13.919 --> 34:16.252
And it's leaked all over
the police radio.

34:16.321 --> 34:18.221
- That's the first
I've heard of it.

34:18.290 --> 34:20.023
- Okay, so good thing
I came back,

34:20.025 --> 34:23.093
'cause nobody knows
anything around here.

34:26.398 --> 34:28.632
(dialing)

34:30.636 --> 34:33.370
- I just want you to know
that word spread about my arrest

34:33.372 --> 34:35.906
Just like we planned.
<i> - Where's my mother?</i>

34:36.041 --> 34:37.640
- You're gonna have
to wait until I get

34:37.676 --> 34:39.309
To where I'm going safely,
and I might be traveling

34:39.444 --> 34:41.311
Under the name balda,
andrea, gaylene,

34:41.380 --> 34:43.112
I mean, you don't know,
you just have to wait.

34:44.817 --> 34:47.384
- Adeline french? Hi.

34:47.519 --> 34:49.419
You're under arrest.
(rhythmic music)

34:49.554 --> 34:50.587
- Go get your mom!

34:55.861 --> 34:56.959
Come on, get up.

34:57.896 --> 34:59.395
Hands behind your back, now.

35:00.732 --> 35:03.600
It's been a while since
you've been to the spa, huh?

35:04.803 --> 35:07.136
Let's go. Adeline french,
you are under arrest.

35:08.006 --> 35:09.739
- Okay, yeah. Let me--
- hey.

35:09.875 --> 35:12.008
I need to get to jillian wood's
room, now. Let's go.

35:12.010 --> 35:13.276
Let's go!
- I'll activate her key.

35:13.411 --> 35:15.912
- Jillian wood's? That it?
- Yeah.

35:15.948 --> 35:17.413
- Yeah?

35:17.449 --> 35:18.681
- Room 1012!

35:23.955 --> 35:25.355
- Excuse me, folks.

35:29.094 --> 35:29.960
Watch your head.

35:33.765 --> 35:35.832
(gunshots)

35:35.967 --> 35:37.967
- Nicky, I need you to get
these cuffs off me.

35:38.036 --> 35:39.169
- We've got to find the car.

35:39.238 --> 35:41.470
- Drop it! Drop it, now!

35:45.644 --> 35:47.644

Hands on your head.

36:29.688 --> 36:32.355

36:32.490 --> 36:34.591
- I said, you're under arrest.

36:35.460 --> 36:36.226
Let's go.

36:38.130 --> 36:38.928
- Mom?

36:40.632 --> 36:42.065
(muffled groaning)
mom!

36:47.639 --> 36:51.308
Oh, my god, mom! You're okay.
You're okay, you're okay.

36:51.443 --> 36:53.777
(sobbing)
it's okay. It's okay.

36:55.780 --> 36:58.147
(sobbing)

37:07.659 --> 37:09.726
(indistinct chatter)

37:13.064 --> 37:14.130
- I'll be fine.

37:15.500 --> 37:18.535
If I had my gun, none of this
would've happened.

37:18.537 --> 37:19.902
- Okay, mom.

37:20.438 --> 37:21.137
- Yeah.

37:22.040 --> 37:23.939
Okay, bye bye.
- Yeah.

37:25.277 --> 37:28.811
Hey, you don't mind staying
with her? I just...

37:28.847 --> 37:30.746
I gotta go tie up a few things.

37:30.782 --> 37:32.015
- I wouldn't want
to be anywhere else.

37:32.017 --> 37:33.283
- Okay.
- I'll get her sorted out,

37:33.352 --> 37:34.551
Then I'll come back
to your place. Alright?

37:34.686 --> 37:35.451
- Okay.

37:36.488 --> 37:37.353
- Bye.

37:40.826 --> 37:43.760
- So, this is... Twice,

37:43.762 --> 37:46.496
That you've saved my ass
in the past three days.

37:48.233 --> 37:49.198
So, thank you.

37:52.704 --> 37:53.869
- It's an ass worth saving.

37:57.242 --> 37:58.341
For the record...

37:59.611 --> 38:02.212
...I also think our relationship
is worth saving.

38:04.650 --> 38:06.182
- Len, I can't go back.

38:08.020 --> 38:09.785
Even before things ended,

38:09.821 --> 38:12.122
We both know that proposal
was too fast.

38:14.526 --> 38:16.259
You were afraid of losing me,

38:16.328 --> 38:19.128
I was afraid that it was
my last chance at a family.

38:21.266 --> 38:22.332
But it wasn't right.

38:22.467 --> 38:23.999
(sighing)

38:24.036 --> 38:26.936
I gotta take care of me.
Alright?

38:27.005 --> 38:29.005
And if I'm being honest,
I think you could do the same.

38:29.140 --> 38:31.340
- That's why I'm gonna take
some time off from work again.

38:33.945 --> 38:37.146
Gonna do some therapy,
avoid undercover,

38:37.215 --> 38:39.048
Work on boundaries.

38:41.753 --> 38:43.186
I just get too intense.

38:44.589 --> 38:47.690
Works for the case,
but screws everything else up.

38:47.693 --> 38:48.824
You know?

38:49.694 --> 38:50.960
- Yeah, I know.

38:53.098 --> 38:54.430
I'm happy for you.

38:56.034 --> 38:57.199
- I envy you.

38:58.937 --> 39:02.171
Best undercover cop I know,
but you're always kelly.

39:04.676 --> 39:07.943
(gentle music)

39:20.959 --> 39:23.325
- You think I got
into this willingly?

39:24.796 --> 39:26.596
It was all ilya. It was...

39:27.632 --> 39:29.366
Will, my brother.

39:29.501 --> 39:32.935
The only reason I had that video
of enrique and his friend

39:32.971 --> 39:34.471
Was as insurance.
And now, thanks to you,

39:34.473 --> 39:35.805
The coyotes know I have it,
and now,

39:35.940 --> 39:37.406
I'm the general's newest target.

39:37.442 --> 39:40.276
- Let me guess. Uh, the general,

39:40.312 --> 39:41.744
That's the head
of the coyote alliance?

39:41.813 --> 39:44.614
- The alliance runs itself.
I mean,

39:44.616 --> 39:47.150
Some people are more powerful
than others,

39:47.152 --> 39:49.886
And the general is one
of those people.

39:49.955 --> 39:51.287
- Is brad michaels the general?

39:51.289 --> 39:53.690
- I don't know brad michaels.

39:55.127 --> 39:56.392
- Come on.

39:57.496 --> 39:59.162
He's the guy that scrambled
your hard drive,

39:59.164 --> 40:00.830
He got your mom's charges
dropped last year,

40:00.899 --> 40:02.097
He's clearly trying to help you.

40:02.134 --> 40:05.368
- Oh, that...
Yeah, I know brad michaels.

40:06.371 --> 40:07.970
Maybe he did it for will.

40:09.174 --> 40:12.442
Or maybe he did it for
the general.

40:14.112 --> 40:16.379
Or maybe he is the general.
I wouldn't know,

40:16.448 --> 40:17.847
'cause he never
told me anything,

40:17.982 --> 40:20.049
Because will saw me
as a liability.

40:20.118 --> 40:21.918
- I can't see why.
Kidnapping grandmas,

40:22.053 --> 40:23.853
Locking cops in the cellar
with the frozen corpse

40:23.988 --> 40:25.187
Of one of your victims.

40:25.223 --> 40:26.288
- Bishop?

40:29.661 --> 40:33.329
I didn't... Sorry.
I didn't kill bishop.

40:33.331 --> 40:35.999
- Of course, you didn't.
- Will did.

40:37.836 --> 40:41.371
They got into it over stu
being an undercover cop,

40:41.506 --> 40:43.673
And then things
got heated, so...

40:44.876 --> 40:46.275
- Is that what happened
between you and will?

40:46.344 --> 40:48.344
Things got heated?

40:48.413 --> 40:50.145
Is that why you killed
your brother?

40:51.616 --> 40:53.349
- I didn't kill my brother.

40:57.355 --> 40:58.221
- I'm so...

40:59.624 --> 41:00.823
(sighs)

41:00.859 --> 41:02.759
I mean... Are you buying
what she's selling?

41:02.894 --> 41:04.260
- My cart's full, but you know,

41:04.395 --> 41:06.095
I'm not putting my credit card
information yet.

41:06.164 --> 41:07.863
- Right?
- Hmm.

41:19.911 --> 41:21.877
In every lie, there's
a little bit of truth.

41:21.913 --> 41:24.313
I'm thinking that general
is that bit of truth, you know?

41:24.349 --> 41:26.916
And maybe, we find the general
before people find out

41:27.051 --> 41:29.118
That I forged arrest records
and get fired.

41:29.120 --> 41:30.653
- Well...

41:30.722 --> 41:33.322
It'd be a hella lot worse
if she actually wasn't arrested.

41:33.358 --> 41:34.824
- Let's find out who's running
that airport.

41:34.893 --> 41:35.791
- I'm on it.

41:40.565 --> 41:43.199
Terminal v for vips.

41:44.870 --> 41:46.669
What a bunch of assholes.

41:46.705 --> 41:48.804
Looks like it just opened up
this week.

41:48.874 --> 41:51.473
(rap music)

41:54.279 --> 41:56.812
It was supposed to open up
six months ago,

41:56.814 --> 41:59.549
But they had "delays".
- Go back, go back.

41:59.551 --> 42:01.150
Look at the board of directors.
- Alright.

42:01.286 --> 42:03.218
- That's the forward key,
press the back, press the back.

42:05.891 --> 42:07.890
Look who's the chair
of the board.

42:07.959 --> 42:09.692
(sighs)

42:09.761 --> 42:12.094
- No way in hell.

42:16.201 --> 42:18.968
- Yo! Do you even know
what he's checking these for?

42:19.037 --> 42:21.170
- You don't ask questions.
Just...

42:21.239 --> 42:23.106
Do what they say
and take the money.

42:24.643 --> 42:26.709
- Nah. Yo.

42:28.313 --> 42:30.779
I'm gonna quit. You should too.

42:31.850 --> 42:33.782
I mean, I'm just waiting
for my--

42:33.818 --> 42:37.319
- Paychecks.
I got them right here.

42:37.355 --> 42:38.921
End of day, you get yours.

42:38.990 --> 42:41.057
(phone ringing)

42:45.330 --> 42:47.463
- Hey, man. Heads up.

42:48.266 --> 42:49.665
The general just arrived.

42:50.802 --> 42:53.535
- What are you looking at?
Back to work.

42:57.676 --> 42:59.575
- I guess we get
to see boss man.

42:59.578 --> 43:01.944
(chuckling)
- I don't think it's a man.

43:05.016 --> 43:06.582
- So nice to see you,
deputy mayor.

43:07.919 --> 43:10.353
(♪)
