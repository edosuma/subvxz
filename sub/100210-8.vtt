WEBVTT

00:02.336 --> 00:03.804
LAINEY: No matter what school
you went to,

00:03.837 --> 00:07.007
we all had those same classic
Thanksgiving traditions,

00:07.041 --> 00:08.542
like the hand-turkey
art exhibit.

00:08.576 --> 00:10.010
Whoa.

00:10.044 --> 00:11.812
The harvest formal,

00:11.845 --> 00:13.814
and the Thanksgiving
food drive.

00:13.847 --> 00:16.350
Now, that's what
I'm talking about, Darla.

00:16.384 --> 00:18.352
Tell your parents thanks
for giving us

00:18.386 --> 00:20.954
eight cans
of chili paste?

00:20.988 --> 00:22.490
Really?

00:22.523 --> 00:24.725
LAINEY: But for us,
the most popular
Thanksgiving tradition

00:24.758 --> 00:26.427
was our alumni flag football,
a casual game

00:26.460 --> 00:28.529
(WHISTLE BLOWS)
where old friends
could reconnect.

00:28.562 --> 00:30.798
Of course, Coach Mellor
treated it like the
Super Bowl.

00:30.831 --> 00:32.166
Damn it,
Ruben Amaro Jr.!

00:32.200 --> 00:34.302
Quit showboating,
and get your head in the game!

00:34.335 --> 00:35.869
We're only up by 42!

00:35.903 --> 00:37.438
Vanessa, stop trying
to catch up

00:37.471 --> 00:39.673
with your friend
you haven't seen in 20 years,

00:39.707 --> 00:41.509
and catch the damn pass!

00:43.043 --> 00:44.812
Boomshakalakalaka!

00:44.845 --> 00:47.014
Okay.
What am I looking at now?

00:47.047 --> 00:49.117
That is my budget proposal
for this year's

00:49.150 --> 00:51.018
Annual National All-School

00:51.051 --> 00:54.488
Alumni Flag Football
Championship Face-Off

00:54.522 --> 00:56.124
Mellor Bowl Extravaganza,

00:56.157 --> 00:57.391
trademark pending.

00:57.425 --> 00:59.860
Rick, I told you.
Stop adding exciting names.

00:59.893 --> 01:02.029
We have to reprint
the banner ever year.

01:02.062 --> 01:04.498
Don't worry.
I factored that
into the budget.

01:04.532 --> 01:06.066
$100,000?

01:06.100 --> 01:09.470
That's as low as I can go.
There is legitimately no room
for negotiation on this.

01:09.503 --> 01:11.872
I'm not giving you a blimp
or a jumbotron, Rick.

01:11.905 --> 01:13.541
Fine,
but I will never back down

01:13.574 --> 01:15.008
on the halftime air show
with the Blue Angels.

01:15.042 --> 01:16.977
I'll give you a cheese plate
and cucumber water.

01:17.010 --> 01:18.512
Add in lemon wedges,
and we got a deal.

01:18.546 --> 01:20.548
No.
I got cucumber-only water!

01:20.581 --> 01:22.550
Mellor wins!
You're going down, sucker.

01:22.583 --> 01:25.919
No, no. To be clear,
I am not coaching against
you this year.

01:25.953 --> 01:27.321
Because I'm unbeatable?

01:27.355 --> 01:29.423
No, because you're
a hyper-competitive meanie

01:29.457 --> 01:31.992
who saps out
every morsel of fun.

01:32.025 --> 01:34.027
I talked to the whole staff.
No one wants to do it.

01:34.061 --> 01:36.797
I can do it.
Seriously?
You want to coach?

01:36.830 --> 01:38.031
Why the surprise, Mellor?

01:38.065 --> 01:39.833
Because
you're a science nerd

01:39.867 --> 01:42.603
who only exercises that
smartypants brain of yours.

01:42.636 --> 01:45.105
True, but I still
love me some football.

01:45.139 --> 01:46.440
Well, at least we'll have
one coach out there

01:46.474 --> 01:47.608
who can keep it sane.

01:47.641 --> 01:48.942
"Sane" is another word
for "loser."

01:48.976 --> 01:51.044
Good luck,
smartypants brain lady.

01:51.078 --> 01:52.680
Ooh, trash talk.
Exciting.

01:52.713 --> 01:54.948
No. You're supposed
to trash talk back.

01:54.982 --> 01:56.217
Come on.

01:56.250 --> 01:58.186
I need to battle somebody
who knows how this works.

01:58.219 --> 02:00.854
How about you battle
your own alienating
competitive attitude?

02:00.888 --> 02:02.122
That's good.

02:02.156 --> 02:03.957
I'll take on
the only man in this school

02:03.991 --> 02:06.460
who's a worthy opponent, me.

02:06.494 --> 02:07.795
Look out, Rick Mellor,

02:07.828 --> 02:09.930
because Rick Mellor
is coming for you.

02:09.963 --> 02:11.031
Too late to back out?

02:11.064 --> 02:12.099
Please don't.

02:12.132 --> 02:13.534
Those tris.
Ooh.

02:13.567 --> 02:15.903
Looking solid
in the tri area.

02:15.936 --> 02:18.772
* One of these days,
you're gonna get outta here

02:18.806 --> 02:21.809
* Live your life
and finally be free

02:21.842 --> 02:24.745
* Go where you wanna go,
do what you wanna do

02:24.778 --> 02:28.382
* Someday, you will say
"Those were the days" *

02:28.416 --> 02:30.984
LAINEY: It was November 20th,
1990-something,

02:31.018 --> 02:32.520
and the William Penn cafeteria

02:32.553 --> 02:34.388
was observing a holiday
tradition of its own.

02:34.422 --> 02:36.657
Nine straight days of
turkey-based dishes?

02:36.690 --> 02:38.259
I mean, is this really
something people
are asking for?

02:38.292 --> 02:40.961
You guys talking
turkey, huh?
(IMITATES CHICKEN)

02:40.994 --> 02:42.162
That's a chicken.
Yeah.

02:42.196 --> 02:44.064
Listen, you guys are lucky,

02:44.097 --> 02:45.132
'cause this Wednesday

02:45.165 --> 02:47.401
is the big faculty
Friendsgiving dinner,

02:47.435 --> 02:49.102
held at my new party pad.

02:49.136 --> 02:50.170
Eh...you know...
Eh. Eh.

02:50.204 --> 02:51.439
Come on.

02:51.472 --> 02:53.106
You guys complain every year
about this tradition,

02:53.140 --> 02:55.175
but in the end,
we all have a blast, right?
Well...

02:55.209 --> 02:56.677
Yeah.
It's cool.

02:56.710 --> 02:57.945
That's a begrudging "yes."

02:57.978 --> 02:59.012
It's all right.

02:59.046 --> 03:00.248
Let's see who's gonna
bring what food.

03:00.281 --> 03:01.482
I'm just take out

03:01.515 --> 03:03.984
my Apple Newton Personal
Digital Assistant here.

03:04.017 --> 03:05.819
Just gonna open my notes.

03:05.853 --> 03:08.088
(CLICK)
Whoops.
Opened up an old note.

03:08.121 --> 03:09.323
Gotta loop back.

03:09.357 --> 03:10.524
Delete.

03:10.558 --> 03:11.692
Delete.

03:11.725 --> 03:13.627
Home screen.
Enter password.

03:13.661 --> 03:15.162
Oh, shoot.
Delete.

03:15.195 --> 03:17.498
And...the battery is dying.

03:17.531 --> 03:18.866
Ignore message.

03:18.899 --> 03:21.201
Okay, Randy G,
what do you want to bring?

03:22.536 --> 03:24.137
Damn it.
Well, at least you stayed.

03:24.171 --> 03:26.206
Are you sure you really want
to do all that cooking again?

03:26.240 --> 03:28.208
Yes.
It's really important
that all the teachers

03:28.242 --> 03:30.978
spend one night a year
just maxin' and relaxin'.

03:31.011 --> 03:32.613
I think the problem is
everyone would rather

03:32.646 --> 03:34.214
max and relax
with their families.

03:34.248 --> 03:35.883
And you don't think
us teachers are a family?

03:35.916 --> 03:39.186
Well, sure. But we're a work
family, not family family.

03:39.219 --> 03:41.522
Well, I think that work family
is family family.

03:41.555 --> 03:44.157
Well, most people think family
family is family family.

03:44.191 --> 03:46.260
Okay, fine. It might not be
family family family,

03:46.294 --> 03:48.896
but it is work family family,
which is still family.

03:48.929 --> 03:51.064
If I promise to bring yams,
can we end this conversation?

03:51.098 --> 03:53.066
(SNAPS FINGERS, CLAPS HANDS)
Yes. Okay.

03:53.100 --> 03:54.468
Let me just put you
in my notes here.

03:54.502 --> 03:58.171
L A, Shoot.
Delete.

03:58.205 --> 04:00.207
While CB was getting
outmatched by fancy new tech,

04:00.240 --> 04:01.675
Coach was making sure

04:01.709 --> 04:03.811
he'd outmatch Wilma
in flag football.

04:03.844 --> 04:05.413
Ah. There she is.

04:05.446 --> 04:07.981
My honorable opponent
for this casual game.

04:08.015 --> 04:09.550
Fun.
Insane fun.

04:09.583 --> 04:10.851
And since you're new

04:10.884 --> 04:13.153
and don't know
any of the alumni playing,

04:13.186 --> 04:14.555
I took the liberty
of creating

04:14.588 --> 04:16.390
two fair and
evenly matched teams.

04:16.424 --> 04:18.091
I gave you some of
the finest athletes

04:18.125 --> 04:19.226
to ever grace this school,

04:19.259 --> 04:22.162
like superstar
and football legend

04:22.195 --> 04:23.997
Deadly Dan the Man.

04:24.031 --> 04:25.333
Then, of course,
there's Brenda Chu.

04:25.366 --> 04:27.067
Girl's a beast on the field.

04:27.100 --> 04:29.670
And I personally reached out
to Adam Goldfarb,

04:29.703 --> 04:32.105
my most memorable athlete
I had back in the '80s.

04:32.139 --> 04:33.374
What's up with his eye?

04:33.407 --> 04:34.775
Wonky, in a good way.

04:34.808 --> 04:36.076
The man can see
the whole field.

04:36.109 --> 04:37.277
Ooh, I should make him
my quarterback.

04:37.311 --> 04:38.712
Ah. Yes.

04:38.746 --> 04:40.581
He definitely knows
what that is.

04:40.614 --> 04:42.082
And as for my team,

04:42.115 --> 04:44.518
just a random assortment
of gangly scrubs

04:44.552 --> 04:46.354
like, uh,
Ruben Amaro Jr., here.

04:46.387 --> 04:47.521
This is gonna be a hoot.

04:47.555 --> 04:48.589
Yes, it is.

04:48.622 --> 04:50.924
Just a silly little game
amongst old friends.

04:50.958 --> 04:52.960
These people
are not your friends.

04:52.993 --> 04:54.928
We must win
at all costs.

04:54.962 --> 04:58.899
This is, without a doubt,
the biggest game of
your lives.

04:58.932 --> 05:00.601
You do know
I'm a professional athlete

05:00.634 --> 05:01.869
who played in
the World Series?

05:01.902 --> 05:03.471
Well, then,
you're warmed up.

05:03.504 --> 05:04.738
Game on!

05:04.772 --> 05:06.807
Hey, Rick, bad news.

05:06.840 --> 05:09.142
My star quarterback,
Adam Goldberg, called.

05:09.176 --> 05:11.311
He said, quote,
"'Terminator 2' just came out,

05:11.345 --> 05:12.546
"and I need to focus."

05:12.580 --> 05:13.781
Damn it, Goldfarb.

05:13.814 --> 05:15.883
You disappoint me athletically
even as an adult!

05:15.916 --> 05:18.085
It's fine.
I got a solid replacement.

05:23.991 --> 05:25.158
Dear Lord.

05:25.192 --> 05:26.394
What's he doing here?

05:26.427 --> 05:28.061
Oh, you two know each other?
Yeah. I know him.

05:28.095 --> 05:29.797
That's my D-hole
big brother.

05:29.830 --> 05:32.400
Well, that D-hole
is my QB.

05:32.433 --> 05:34.301
Nick Mellor
is prepared to play

05:34.334 --> 05:36.804
this bastardized version
of America's game.

05:36.837 --> 05:38.338
Let's flag it up!

05:38.372 --> 05:40.107
We seriously have to play
against this thing?

05:40.140 --> 05:42.610
No, because Coach Wilma
is cheating.

05:42.643 --> 05:44.077
You cheat, cheater.

05:44.111 --> 05:45.579
You're the one who took
all the good players

05:45.613 --> 05:46.914
and stuck me
with the goobers.

05:46.947 --> 05:48.281
You know about that?

05:48.315 --> 05:50.818
I can spot a goober
a mile away,
'cause I was a goober.

05:50.851 --> 05:52.420
You know, I just did this
to have some fun,

05:52.453 --> 05:53.654
but now you got me mad.

05:53.687 --> 05:55.623
Good, 'cause I like
a little competition.

05:55.656 --> 05:57.024
When this game is over,

05:57.057 --> 05:59.927
you will look me in the eyes
and say, "Wilma wins."

05:59.960 --> 06:01.462
You're going down,
little bro!

06:01.495 --> 06:03.997
Yeah, suck it,
Coach Mellor.

06:04.031 --> 06:05.198
Also, hi,
Coach Mellor.

06:05.232 --> 06:06.366
You're looking lean.

06:06.400 --> 06:07.501
Okay,
we ready for the coin flip?

06:07.535 --> 06:09.803
No. No flip.
Not until you tell
my big brother

06:09.837 --> 06:11.038
he can't play
in this game.

06:11.071 --> 06:12.806
Nick's an alumni.
Of course he can play.

06:12.840 --> 06:15.142
Sounds to me like
it's game on, bitch.

06:15.175 --> 06:16.977
Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa!

06:17.010 --> 06:18.546
Okay, this is not
a real game.

06:18.579 --> 06:20.113
Let's lay off
the "bitch" talk.

06:20.147 --> 06:21.882
My bad. Just excited
to have fun out there.

06:23.016 --> 06:24.552
(MOUTHS WORD)
She did it again!

06:24.585 --> 06:26.386
Wilma,
I'm a little thrown

06:26.420 --> 06:28.355
by this whole new
competitive thing
you got going on.

06:28.388 --> 06:31.224
New? I'm the one that drove
my kids to place first

06:31.258 --> 06:33.561
in the citywide
academic decathlon, remember?

06:33.594 --> 06:34.995
Yeah, but that was math.

06:35.028 --> 06:36.664
I didn't think it would
translate to real things.

06:36.697 --> 06:38.799
Oh, it translates.
Game on!

06:38.832 --> 06:40.033
(MOUTHS WORD)

06:40.067 --> 06:41.134
Hey!
I heard that!

06:41.168 --> 06:42.636
I heard it.
I saw it.

06:42.670 --> 06:44.337
LAINEY: Wilma had shown
a new side
of herself at school,

06:44.371 --> 06:47.508
and I was about to see
a new side of CB at home.

06:47.541 --> 06:49.209
Hi.
Morning.

06:49.242 --> 06:51.078
Thought I'd swing by
on my way to school.

06:51.111 --> 06:52.580
No, uh, come in.

06:52.613 --> 06:54.815
Uh, do you want a Danish
or some coffee or anything?

06:54.848 --> 06:56.249
I have neither.
Um, I'm sorry.

06:56.283 --> 06:57.585
I'm a little bit
frazzled.

06:57.618 --> 06:59.152
I wasn't expecting you.
Oh, bed head.

06:59.186 --> 07:00.387
Oh, God.

07:00.420 --> 07:02.723
Wow. Really digging
the new party pad.

07:02.756 --> 07:05.826
Oh, yeah. Here, let me
give you the grand tour.

07:05.859 --> 07:09.396
Here's my Sony three-disc
CD player with bass boost.

07:09.429 --> 07:12.199
In case you get bored,
whip out the Bop It.
Beep-beep!

07:12.232 --> 07:13.734
Super fun-guy
blow-up furniture.

07:13.767 --> 07:17.204
I'm standing outside,
'cause I have an
outdoor patio.

07:17.237 --> 07:19.072
Are you a fan of NBA star
Shaquille O'Neal?

07:19.106 --> 07:20.440
Do you like kung-fu?

07:20.474 --> 07:23.210
Well, now you can experience
both with, "Shaq Fu."

07:23.243 --> 07:24.545
I don't know what that is,

07:24.578 --> 07:26.379
and I don't want to find out,
so no.

07:26.413 --> 07:27.915
I just came by
to drop off the yams

07:27.948 --> 07:29.349
'cause I can't make
Friendsgiving tonight.

07:29.382 --> 07:30.918
Oh, no!
Please don't bail.

07:30.951 --> 07:32.119
I know.
I'm sorry.

07:32.152 --> 07:34.254
But it's the one time
everyone's back in town.

07:34.287 --> 07:36.023
Barry flew in,
and we're going to Buckets

07:36.056 --> 07:37.525
with Erica and the JTP.

07:37.558 --> 07:39.793
Well, thanks for the
giant mound of yams.
Really appreciate it.

07:39.827 --> 07:41.695
Now we've got some great
leftovers for tomorrow.

07:41.729 --> 07:43.230
Wait, tomorrow's
Thanksgiving.

07:43.263 --> 07:44.431
Right. Yeah.

07:44.464 --> 07:46.634
That means I'll be doing
my Thanksgiving plans

07:46.667 --> 07:48.035
at my Thanksgiving
appointment.

07:48.068 --> 07:50.303
You do have somewhere to go
for Thanksgiving, right?

07:50.337 --> 07:52.706
Yeah. Of course.
I got plans with my folks.

07:52.740 --> 07:53.874
Aren't they
in the Bahamas?

07:53.907 --> 07:56.076
Mm. Yes.
I did tell you that.

07:56.109 --> 07:57.978
I meant, um,
my Philly folks.

07:58.011 --> 07:59.780
Big dinner, 16 cousins.

07:59.813 --> 08:01.982
We're all heading over
to my Aunt Sh... Shlamma.

08:02.015 --> 08:03.584
Aunt who?
Shaltmor?

08:03.617 --> 08:04.718
I don't know
what you're saying.

08:04.752 --> 08:06.053
My Aunt Sh,
Shirlimonst.

08:06.086 --> 08:07.220
Are you saying
"Shirlimonst"?

08:07.254 --> 08:08.822
Are you?
I think so.

08:08.856 --> 08:12.459
Anywhoozle, still got
a ton of stuff to cook
for Friendsgiving.

08:12.492 --> 08:14.127
You do know school starts
in an hour, right?

08:14.161 --> 08:15.663
Oh, no worries.

08:15.696 --> 08:17.297
I got three crock pots
on high

08:17.330 --> 08:20.267
and the Ron Popeil
Showtime Rotisserie.

08:20.300 --> 08:22.770
You just set it
and forget it.

08:22.803 --> 08:23.971
Alright. Let's roll.

08:24.004 --> 08:25.573
You're wearing pajamas.

08:25.606 --> 08:27.007
Did forget that.

08:27.040 --> 08:28.976
LAINEY: As CB was
setting and forgetting

08:29.009 --> 08:30.310
his Thanksgiving plans,

08:30.343 --> 08:31.945
Wilma and Mellor
were coaching a game

08:31.979 --> 08:34.915
to be remembered forever,
for all the wrong reasons.

08:34.948 --> 08:36.116
Come on, ref!

08:36.149 --> 08:37.751
He's not even pretending
to go for the flag!

08:37.785 --> 08:38.886
GLASCOTT: What do you
want me to do?

08:38.919 --> 08:40.921
I told him this was just
for fun, but he won't listen.

08:40.954 --> 08:42.956
Aah!

08:42.990 --> 08:45.125
Sounds like your boys
have had enough, Ricky.

08:45.158 --> 08:47.494
Never!
Everyone calm down.

08:47.527 --> 08:50.263
This is supposed to be a
friendly game amongst friends.

08:50.297 --> 08:51.865
Aah!
Ohh!

08:51.899 --> 08:54.167
All right, you know what?
Time to bring in the big guns.

08:54.201 --> 08:56.804
Fitzy, you're out!
I'm QB!

08:56.837 --> 08:59.006
You can't play!
You're a coach!
Tell him, ref.

08:59.039 --> 09:00.140
And an alumni.

09:00.173 --> 09:01.474
Tell her, ref.

09:01.508 --> 09:03.911
Well, if coaches can play,
I'm going in, too.

09:03.944 --> 09:05.012
Flags off!

09:05.045 --> 09:06.847
It's real football now!
(CLIPBOARD THUDS)

09:06.880 --> 09:08.515
Game on, nerd lady!

09:08.548 --> 09:09.717
Blue 32!

09:09.750 --> 09:12.385
Please do not call plays
like this is a real game!

09:12.419 --> 09:13.553
Hut, hut!

09:17.257 --> 09:18.525
(THUD)

09:20.227 --> 09:21.962
(GRUNTS)
Aah!

09:21.995 --> 09:23.196
(GROANS)

09:23.230 --> 09:24.397
(WHISTLE BLOWS)

09:24.431 --> 09:25.966
Okay, that's it!
I'm calling the game!

09:25.999 --> 09:28.135
Which means we win!

09:28.168 --> 09:30.003
Go on! Say it!
Never!

09:30.037 --> 09:31.571
Say it!
Say "Wilma wins"!

09:31.605 --> 09:33.106
Is she single?

09:35.208 --> 09:37.878
LAINEY: After the flag
football fiasco, Glascott
was ready to celebrate

09:37.911 --> 09:39.880
the true spirit
of Thanksgiving.

09:39.913 --> 09:43.817
We are pilgrims,
and to show peace,
we give you this first dinner.

09:43.851 --> 09:47.254
And in return,
we give you all of our land.

09:47.287 --> 09:49.422
Thanks for being
so giving.

09:49.456 --> 09:51.925
Thanksgiving!
Thanksgiving!

09:53.861 --> 09:55.863
Gobble gobble, everyone.

09:55.896 --> 09:57.330
(LAUGHS)

09:57.364 --> 09:59.399
But seriously, I have
a big announcement to make.

09:59.432 --> 10:01.869
We will be extending
our Thanksgiving food drive

10:01.902 --> 10:03.236
through the weekend.

10:03.270 --> 10:06.006
So, please bring any
leftover cans you might have.

10:06.039 --> 10:07.074
(FEEDBACK)

10:07.107 --> 10:08.709
Gobble gobble.

10:08.742 --> 10:10.978
I, too,
have a big announcement.

10:11.011 --> 10:13.847
Tomorrow at 4:00 p.m.,
3:00 p.m. central,

10:13.881 --> 10:15.949
there will be
a flag football rematch.

10:15.983 --> 10:17.117
Wait, what?

10:17.150 --> 10:18.385
I'm looking for some
tough players,

10:18.418 --> 10:20.620
could be an alumni,
a parent,

10:20.654 --> 10:24.291
a strong uncle with soft hands
and elite escapability.

10:24.324 --> 10:25.893
Gobble gobble.

10:25.926 --> 10:27.795
I, too, would like
to make an announcement.

10:27.828 --> 10:30.563
There will not be
a rematch of today's game,

10:30.597 --> 10:35.302
as I'm officially retiring
unbeaten, unbroken,
and unbowed.

10:35.335 --> 10:36.536
Thank you.

10:36.569 --> 10:38.505
And I'd like to announce
that's a punk move!

10:38.538 --> 10:39.873
Gobble gobble.

10:39.907 --> 10:41.909
Well, I'd like to announce,
you just got to
accept the fact

10:41.942 --> 10:43.911
that there's someone
better than you.

10:43.944 --> 10:46.413
And I'd like to announce
that I'll take you on

10:46.446 --> 10:47.881
any time, any place!

10:47.915 --> 10:50.050
And my announcement
is that there will be

10:50.083 --> 10:52.252
no more
announcements ever.

10:52.285 --> 10:54.121
(ELECTRICITY CRACKLES,
AUDIENCE GASPS)

10:55.355 --> 10:58.225
Make your way
to the nearest exit.
Gobble gobble.

10:58.258 --> 11:00.761
LAINEY: Losing to Wilma was
something Coach would
never forget.

11:00.794 --> 11:02.429
As for CB, he learned

11:02.462 --> 11:04.264
you don't set and forget
a whole Thanksgiving meal.

11:04.297 --> 11:06.299
(ELECTRICITY CRACKLES)

11:06.333 --> 11:07.735
Bro! Your apartment's
on fire!

11:07.768 --> 11:08.902
CB: Fire?

11:08.936 --> 11:12.639
Okay, everyone, learn
while I'm gone, because fire!

11:14.742 --> 11:16.309
All of it is gone.

11:16.343 --> 11:17.610
You don't know that.

11:17.644 --> 11:20.981
Um, maybe it's not
as bad as it looks.

11:21.014 --> 11:23.450
Not my Sony stereo
with bass boost.

11:23.483 --> 11:25.252
How will I boost my bass?

11:25.285 --> 11:27.320
My fun-guy
blow-up furniture.

11:27.354 --> 11:29.823
It's neither fun
nor blown up!

11:29.857 --> 11:31.959
Not you too, "Shaq Fu"!

11:31.992 --> 11:33.861
How could a simple fire

11:33.894 --> 11:36.496
beat a 7-foot-tall
kung-fu master

11:36.529 --> 11:39.032
who sometimes plays
professional basketball?

11:39.066 --> 11:40.367
How?

11:40.400 --> 11:42.135
(DISTORTED BEEP)
(DISTORTED) Bop it.

11:42.169 --> 11:44.872
Dude, I've never seen you
actually mad before,
and it's weird.

11:44.905 --> 11:46.940
I cannot wait to find out

11:46.974 --> 11:48.308
what dillweed
in this building

11:48.341 --> 11:49.442
is responsible for this.

11:49.476 --> 11:50.844
Well, found the culprit,

11:50.878 --> 11:52.345
LAINEY: Oh.

11:52.379 --> 11:54.014
You're the dillweed.

11:54.047 --> 11:56.683
Well, the good news,
you can tell the teachers
that they got their wish,

11:56.716 --> 11:58.485
'cause Friendsgiving
is torched.

11:58.518 --> 12:00.153
It's gonna be okay,
dude.

12:00.187 --> 12:01.354
You can stay with me

12:01.388 --> 12:02.890
until you figure out
what to do.

12:02.923 --> 12:04.457
Nah.
Barry's staying with you.

12:04.491 --> 12:06.493
I don't want to...

12:06.526 --> 12:08.128
I'll just sleep
in my bedroom,

12:08.161 --> 12:10.363
otherwise known as
the outdoor patio.

12:11.264 --> 12:14.001
Oh, spider!
There's a spider.

12:14.034 --> 12:17.938
I hate this outdoor
patio bedroom so much.

12:19.206 --> 12:21.041
You two should be
ashamed of yourselves

12:21.074 --> 12:24.511
for ruining that ridiculously
inaccurate Thanksgiving play.

12:24.544 --> 12:26.313
I hate to do this,
but as head of school,

12:26.346 --> 12:27.915
you leave me no choice.

12:27.948 --> 12:29.616
You two are no longer allowed

12:29.649 --> 12:32.419
to be competitive
on school grounds ever again.

12:32.452 --> 12:35.388
You do realize that I'm, like,
in charge of sports, right?

12:35.422 --> 12:37.524
And you just can't tell
someone not to be competitive.

12:37.557 --> 12:39.192
I mean, this is who I am.

12:39.226 --> 12:40.894
Okay.
Then let's get to the root

12:40.928 --> 12:44.531
of why you both
refuse to lose,
no matter what the cost.

12:44.564 --> 12:47.767
Well, I grew up with
four older brothers.

12:47.801 --> 12:50.103
They loved sports,
and I loved my microscope.

12:50.137 --> 12:52.572
They teased me
and called me a loser.

12:52.605 --> 12:56.009
That's why, as a kid,
I began to win at all costs,

12:56.043 --> 12:57.878
so no one would ever call me
a loser again.

12:57.911 --> 12:59.012
Wow.

12:59.046 --> 13:00.080
Yes,
it's very impressive.

13:00.113 --> 13:02.449
But not as impressive
as my story.

13:02.482 --> 13:04.952
When I was a kid,
my dream was to have a family

13:04.985 --> 13:06.887
and to grow up to be
the dad I never had.

13:08.055 --> 13:10.490
Until I have kids of my own,
those students that I coach,

13:11.591 --> 13:13.160
those are my children.

13:14.327 --> 13:16.029
And this flag football game

13:16.063 --> 13:17.264
(VOICE BREAKING)
is the only time

13:17.297 --> 13:19.266
Daddy gets to see
his babies.

13:19.299 --> 13:21.902
Really was
a touching story, Rick,

13:21.935 --> 13:23.636
almost as touching as mine.

13:23.670 --> 13:25.605
Well, did you cry
during your story?

13:25.638 --> 13:26.739
'Cause Mellor cried.

13:26.773 --> 13:28.041
You don't think
Wilma can cry?

13:28.075 --> 13:29.176
Watch this.
No!

13:29.209 --> 13:30.911
(SOBBING)
Guys, do not compete

13:30.944 --> 13:33.213
over who has
the sadder backstory.

13:33.246 --> 13:34.581
But if you had to choose

13:34.614 --> 13:36.083
who had the saddest
in this room, who would it be?

13:36.116 --> 13:38.852
Me. I win that game every day.

13:38.886 --> 13:39.987
So cut it out.

13:40.020 --> 13:41.989
Okay, boss.
No more competing.

13:42.022 --> 13:43.456
At the very least,
you have my word.

13:43.490 --> 13:45.092
What? You think I can't
stop competing?

13:45.125 --> 13:46.326
Not the way I can.

13:46.359 --> 13:48.095
While I see the irony
of you two

13:48.128 --> 13:50.030
competing over
who can compete less,

13:50.063 --> 13:51.564
I'm good if it ends all this.

13:51.598 --> 13:52.632
It's over.

13:52.665 --> 13:54.067
And we all agree,
I won at losing.

13:54.101 --> 13:55.535
Which is what
the winner would say,

13:55.568 --> 13:57.570
which means I won
even though I lost!

13:57.604 --> 13:58.906
No, you lost lost because

13:58.939 --> 14:00.307
I stopped competing
10 minutes ago.

14:02.209 --> 14:04.144
I have been looking
for you guys everywhere!

14:04.177 --> 14:05.312
I need your help.
It's for CB.

14:05.345 --> 14:07.347
Ugh. Is this about his
annoying Friendsgiving?

14:07.380 --> 14:08.615
So annoying.

14:08.648 --> 14:10.483
I liked the concept at first,
but he's annoying.

14:10.517 --> 14:12.152
He also lost everything
in a fire.

14:12.185 --> 14:14.121
Oh, my God!
Good guy. A good guy.

14:14.154 --> 14:15.455
(CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY)

14:15.488 --> 14:17.224
Are you done? 'Cause CB
has no family out here,

14:17.257 --> 14:18.758
and he refuses
to stay with me.

14:18.791 --> 14:20.427
Well, he can stay with me.
I insist.

14:20.460 --> 14:22.062
Don't you have a parrot
that swoops down

14:22.095 --> 14:24.364
on anyone that it perceives
as a rival for
your affections?

14:24.397 --> 14:27.200
Well, I will show photos of CB
to Feather Locklear

14:27.234 --> 14:28.801
to let her know
we have a new houseguest.

14:28.835 --> 14:32.039
Okay. While Glascott runs
things by his avian
life partner,

14:32.072 --> 14:33.306
why don't we pitch in

14:33.340 --> 14:35.542
to throw a kickass
Friendsgiving
that CB deserves?

14:35.575 --> 14:36.944
Genius.
What do you need?

14:36.977 --> 14:39.146
I am covering desserts,
Coop's on place settings,

14:39.179 --> 14:41.681
Grange is covering
decorations, Johnny Atkins
has a gourd guy.

14:41.714 --> 14:43.116
So, we're on
main course?

14:43.150 --> 14:44.517
Exactly.
You do turkey.

14:44.551 --> 14:46.153
Wilma, can you do
stuffing and sides?

14:46.186 --> 14:47.554
On it.
Great.

14:47.587 --> 14:49.189
This is perfect.

14:49.222 --> 14:51.191
Everybody knows Mellor
makes a mean turkey

14:51.224 --> 14:53.393
and an even meaner
cranberry sauce.
Hmm.

14:53.426 --> 14:55.162
Not as mean as mine.

14:55.195 --> 14:57.730
Cranberry sauce is like,
my thing.

14:57.764 --> 14:59.132
Well, it can't
be your thing

14:59.166 --> 15:01.201
because I said
it's my thing first.

15:01.234 --> 15:04.037
Trust me. You do not want
to take on my sauce.

15:04.071 --> 15:08.008
Lady, this is a war
you will not win.

15:08.041 --> 15:10.343
LAINEY:
The battle between Coach
and Wilma raged on.

15:10.377 --> 15:12.712
Meanwhile,
CB was in for an ambush.

15:12.745 --> 15:13.913
Whoa.

15:13.947 --> 15:15.248
We found
the makeshift hobo tent

15:15.282 --> 15:16.549
you set up
under the bleachers.

15:16.583 --> 15:18.018
Yeah, well, that's because

15:18.051 --> 15:20.087
it wouldn't fit
on my outdoor patio.

15:20.120 --> 15:21.721
Look, I want you to come
and stay with me

15:21.754 --> 15:22.990
until you're back
on your feet.

15:23.023 --> 15:25.025
Oh, no.
I don't want to impose.
I insist.

15:25.058 --> 15:26.926
Starting tonight,
you are staying with me

15:26.960 --> 15:28.328
and my territorial parrot

15:28.361 --> 15:30.497
who pecks her own feathers
due to anxiety.

15:30.530 --> 15:32.332
Put it there, roomie.
I'm gonna snap.

15:32.365 --> 15:34.567
No, no. No snapping.
And you know why?

15:34.601 --> 15:36.236
'Cause the whole staff
has banded together

15:36.269 --> 15:37.737
to throw you the Friendsgiving
that you deserve.

15:37.770 --> 15:38.905
Really?

15:38.938 --> 15:40.140
Really.
Really.

15:41.408 --> 15:43.043
Surprise.
Hey, hey, hey!

15:43.076 --> 15:44.411
Why are there
so many gourds?

15:44.444 --> 15:46.279
You said go to my gourd guy
and get the gourds.

15:46.313 --> 15:47.514
I got the gourds.

15:47.547 --> 15:49.782
Doesn't matter.
What matters most
is that we're all here

15:49.816 --> 15:51.784
to celebrate you
and the magic of
Friendsgiving...

15:51.818 --> 15:52.952
Do you mean
Friendsgi?

15:52.986 --> 15:54.988
They gave me
three minutes, three.

15:55.022 --> 15:56.889
Well, what really matters
is, uh,

15:56.923 --> 15:58.825
this killer meal
we organized just for you.

15:58.858 --> 16:00.960
Attention, teachers
of the lounge!

16:00.994 --> 16:03.763
The world's best cranberry
sauce has arrived!

16:03.796 --> 16:05.065
Which is mine.

16:05.098 --> 16:07.700
Guys, where's the food
to put the sauce on?

16:07.734 --> 16:08.968
It, um, well...
Oh.

16:09.002 --> 16:11.071
Yeah. Did, okay.
I'll...

16:11.104 --> 16:13.940
So, all we have for my
Friendsgiving is sauce?

16:13.973 --> 16:18.378
My recipe is so versatile
that it presents
like a sauce...

16:18.411 --> 16:20.847
Mine is so hearty.
...but goes down like a soup.

16:20.880 --> 16:22.749
It eats like a meal.

16:22.782 --> 16:23.916
Meal beats soup.

16:23.950 --> 16:25.652
You two need to leave
right now.

16:25.685 --> 16:27.154
No one is leaving
until we all sit down

16:27.187 --> 16:29.622
and tell CB how thankful
we are to have him
in our lives.

16:29.656 --> 16:30.990
Granger?
Yes.

16:31.024 --> 16:32.425
Uh, I'm very
thankful for CB,

16:32.459 --> 16:35.562
a man of true honor, who would
never criticize my banner.

16:35.595 --> 16:37.097
Wow.
Johnny.

16:37.130 --> 16:39.066
I'm also thankful
CB's here.

16:39.099 --> 16:41.234
Because of you, bro,
I got to reconnect with Brad,

16:41.268 --> 16:42.302
my gourd guy.

16:42.335 --> 16:44.437
Such a solid dude.
Always comes through.

16:44.471 --> 16:46.673
He's like CB, but just,
the best.

16:46.706 --> 16:48.841
Really was worth having
my place burning down

16:48.875 --> 16:50.677
so that you could
reconnect with Brad.

16:50.710 --> 16:52.011
You're welcome.

16:52.045 --> 16:54.013
Rick, Wilma, give some
real thanks, quick.

16:54.047 --> 16:55.848
Yes, I am thankful that CB

16:55.882 --> 16:56.983
is the heart and soul
of this faculty,

16:57.016 --> 16:59.186
so kind, so caring,
so honest.

16:59.219 --> 17:01.988
So, tell us, honestly,
whose sauce is better,

17:02.021 --> 17:03.156
hers or mine?

17:03.190 --> 17:05.658
I'm thankful CB's
gonna choose my sauce.

17:05.692 --> 17:07.026
CB: Oh.
Touching stuff.

17:07.060 --> 17:09.262
I'd like to take my turn
and thank you all

17:09.296 --> 17:10.763
for throwing me
a Friendsgiving

17:10.797 --> 17:12.799
that truly reflects
what we mean to each other.

17:12.832 --> 17:14.134
Aww.
Aww.

17:14.167 --> 17:16.536
See, silly me considered
you all my family family,

17:16.569 --> 17:18.305
but you're not.
You're not even
my work family.

17:18.338 --> 17:20.006
You're just a bunch of
random people that
I work with,

17:20.039 --> 17:21.941
and it's on me for trying
to make it anything more.

17:21.974 --> 17:23.276
But we're all here
for you.

17:23.310 --> 17:24.777
It's the thought
that counts, right?

17:24.811 --> 17:25.912
Let's be honest,
none of you

17:25.945 --> 17:27.714
actually really cared
about Friendsgiving.

17:29.549 --> 17:31.351
Enjoy the weekend
with your families.

17:38.158 --> 17:40.026
LAINEY: After our disastrous
Friendsgiving,

17:40.059 --> 17:43.530
I took it upon myself
to restore CB's faith
in his work family.

17:45.898 --> 17:49.035
Morning, sunshine.
You look...awake.

17:49.068 --> 17:50.870
I spent the night
on Glascott's couch

17:50.903 --> 17:53.606
with a hateful parrot
staring me down.

17:53.640 --> 17:56.243
Look, I know our half-assed,
last-minute Friendsgiving

17:56.276 --> 17:58.345
didn't exactly make you feel
like we're there for you.

17:58.378 --> 17:59.512
Not even a little.

17:59.546 --> 18:00.847
Well, I still
refuse to give up.

18:00.880 --> 18:02.915
Even though I'm broke,
I bought you a few key things

18:02.949 --> 18:04.917
for your new party pad.

18:04.951 --> 18:08.388
Screw having a blow-up couch,
'cause you got a
blow-up chair.

18:08.421 --> 18:10.723
Okay, it's a beach ball,
but you can sit on it.

18:10.757 --> 18:13.025
Sure,
your Bop It's gone, okay?

18:13.059 --> 18:14.994
But you know
what's even better?

18:15.027 --> 18:16.763
Cup-it.

18:16.796 --> 18:18.998
Cup-it!
Cup-it!

18:19.031 --> 18:21.434
And of course,
no party pad is complete

18:21.468 --> 18:24.271
without a Swony stereo
with bass boost.

18:24.304 --> 18:25.605
Did you just say "Swony"?

18:25.638 --> 18:28.007
Yes. It's actually better
than Sony and costs $10.

18:28.040 --> 18:30.109
Lainey, I really
appreciate what you did,

18:30.143 --> 18:32.111
but this isn't on you
to fix.

18:32.145 --> 18:33.780
It's on me for,

18:33.813 --> 18:35.615
thinking all us
teachers were family.

18:35.648 --> 18:38.585
Dude, we're dysfunctional
and competitive

18:38.618 --> 18:40.387
and we let
each other down.

18:40.420 --> 18:42.389
But if that's not family,
I don't know what is.

18:42.422 --> 18:44.191
Okay, maybe you're
there for me.

18:44.224 --> 18:46.993
But it's pretty clear
nobody else is.

18:47.994 --> 18:49.596
I wouldn't be
so sure about that.

18:49.629 --> 18:50.930
Come on.
Follow us, buddy.

18:50.963 --> 18:52.232
There's something
you've got to see.

18:52.265 --> 18:55.435
* I'll stand by you

18:55.468 --> 18:57.570
* I'll stand by you *

18:57.604 --> 18:59.572
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

18:59.606 --> 19:00.940
Oh, my gosh.

19:04.110 --> 19:05.745
What the...

19:05.778 --> 19:07.113
Is this all for me?

19:07.146 --> 19:09.048
We spread the word
that you lost everything.

19:09.081 --> 19:10.250
Oh, my God.

19:10.283 --> 19:12.852
Turns out, everything you need
is right here in this room.

19:14.854 --> 19:18.225
Sorry about that dinner, CB,
but we really are family.

19:18.258 --> 19:20.693
Not just us.
Everyone in this school.

19:21.528 --> 19:22.829
(EXHALES SHARPLY)

19:25.097 --> 19:27.934
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

19:27.967 --> 19:29.302
Oh.

19:34.173 --> 19:36.142
Got to admit,
it feels good

19:36.175 --> 19:37.810
knowing there's another
teacher in this place

19:37.844 --> 19:39.846
who likes to win
as much as I do.

19:39.879 --> 19:42.982
I wanted to win so badly,
I even spilled my guts
to Glascott

19:43.015 --> 19:45.285
about all that stupid
"wanting to be a dad" stuff.

19:45.318 --> 19:47.153
Don't worry.
I never told anyone

19:47.186 --> 19:49.289
about how my brothers
thought I was a loser.

19:49.322 --> 19:51.123
They couldn't be more wrong
about you.

19:51.624 --> 19:53.360
Thanks.

19:53.393 --> 19:54.861
And I think everyone
would agree

19:54.894 --> 19:56.629
you're gonna make
one hell of a dad.

19:56.663 --> 19:57.797
Ah, damn it.

19:57.830 --> 19:59.165
You're gonna make me cry
for real this time.

19:59.198 --> 20:01.167
It's not a competition.

20:01.200 --> 20:02.969
LAINEY: That's the thing
about Thanksgiving.

20:03.002 --> 20:05.104
It can make the most
competitive friends stop

20:05.137 --> 20:08.107
and be grateful that they have
each other in their lives.

20:08.140 --> 20:09.642
Happy Friendsgiving, Lain.

20:09.676 --> 20:10.977
I'll see you Monday?

20:11.010 --> 20:13.079
I'll see you tonight.
You're crashing at my place.

20:13.112 --> 20:15.615
No. I don't want to impose
on you and Barry.

20:15.648 --> 20:18.117
It's cool.
Barry can stay
at his mom's.

20:18.150 --> 20:19.719
Beverly Goldberg
is more than happy

20:19.752 --> 20:21.921
to have any of her kids back
at home for the weekend,

20:21.954 --> 20:23.290
or forever.

20:23.323 --> 20:24.657
Are you sure?

20:24.691 --> 20:26.025
Of course.
You're family.

20:26.058 --> 20:27.960
LAINEY: Even when
you've lost everything,

20:27.994 --> 20:30.997
your family is the one thing
you'll always have.

20:31.030 --> 20:33.032
It doesn't matter
if it's family family

20:33.065 --> 20:34.434
or your work family,

20:34.467 --> 20:35.735
we should just be thankful

20:35.768 --> 20:37.169
to have the people
we love at our side,

20:37.203 --> 20:38.605
and they'll stand by you.

20:38.638 --> 20:40.340
Yes.

20:44.611 --> 20:45.978
What happened when

20:46.012 --> 20:47.380
you found out
that your house was on fire

20:47.414 --> 20:48.515
while you were
teaching?

20:48.548 --> 20:49.916
The intercom went off
in my room,

20:49.949 --> 20:52.051
and they said,
"Your house is on fire."

20:52.084 --> 20:53.286
So I ran out of the building,

20:53.320 --> 20:55.021
and then I realized
I didn't have a car.

20:55.054 --> 20:56.088
I walked to school
that day.

20:56.122 --> 20:57.357
So, I ran back in,

20:57.390 --> 20:59.659
and the receptionist at school
tossed me her keys,

20:59.692 --> 21:01.260
and I ran out to her car,
and then I realized

21:01.294 --> 21:02.429
I don't know
what car she had.

21:02.462 --> 21:04.063
So then I finally
got in the car and went,

21:04.096 --> 21:05.665
and there were firemen

21:05.698 --> 21:07.066
throwing burning logs
through the windows.

21:07.099 --> 21:08.335
It was crazy.

21:08.368 --> 21:09.502
The principal of
the school realized

21:09.536 --> 21:11.270
that I had been in class,
so they walked in,

21:11.304 --> 21:13.172
and there were kids,
and they were still working.

21:13.205 --> 21:15.241
That made me proud, to think
that even though
I wasn't there,

21:15.274 --> 21:17.243
they carried on
without me.
Sweet.

21:17.276 --> 21:18.945
There was one time,
I was walking down the street,

21:18.978 --> 21:20.580
and a woman pulled over
in her car and said,

21:20.613 --> 21:22.349
"I have some pots and pans
in the back."

21:22.382 --> 21:24.517
And I still have
some of those pots and pans.

21:24.551 --> 21:28.087
I am gonna be forever in debt
to the school community.

21:28.120 --> 21:29.255
That's beautiful.
