{\an8}SHE WAS LIKE,
"FUCK YOU. I HATE YOU."

07:18.938 --> 07:21.232
{\an8}SHE THREW A COUPLE THINGS AT ME
BUT NOTHING HARD.

07:21.315 --> 07:23.776
{\an8}- NO WINE BOTTLES?
- NO WINE BOTTLES OR SPATULAS.

07:23.860 --> 07:25.027
{\an8}- SHE ADMITTED
THAT SHE HOOKED UP WITH YOU?

07:25.111 --> 07:27.196
{\an8}- UH, SHE DIDN'T--
SHE DIDN'T DISAGREE.

07:27.280 --> 07:29.031
{\an8}- HOLD ON.

07:29.115 --> 07:30.449
{\an8}IN JIONNI'S HEAD RIGHT NOW--

07:30.533 --> 07:32.869
{\an8}HE WON'T SAY THIS,
'CAUSE HE'S A PUSSY, BUT...

07:32.952 --> 07:34.620
{\an8}- [laughs]
- JESUS.

07:34.704 --> 07:36.080

SIX NIGHTS A WEEK.

{\an8}- WHILE SHE'S
BAGGING FUCKING GUYS.

07:48.926 --> 07:51.137
{\an8}- I REST MY CASE.
THAT'S WHY HE DON'T CARE.

07:51.220 --> 07:53.556
{\an8}I THINK JIONNI TOOK THE NEWS
SO WELL ONLY BECAUSE

{\an8}HE KNOWS SNOOKI'S HOOKING UP

07:54.974 --> 07:56.392
{\an8}'CAUSE HE'S DOING
THE SAME DAMN THING.

07:56.475 --> 07:58.394

A JOKE.

07:58.477 --> 07:59.520
{\an8}- THEY ARE MEANT TO BE.

07:59.604 --> 08:01.397

JUST LIKE SHE DID.

"INSTEAD OF HELPING YOU OUT,

22:24.843 --> 22:26.762
{\an8}LET ME GO HAVE SEX
WITH JIONNI."

22:26.845 --> 22:28.305
{\an8}- [laughs]

22:28.388 --> 22:30.348
{\an8}- IT KIND OF HURTS
MY FEELINGS.

{\an8}IF I NEED YOU,
BE THERE FOR ME.

22:31.850 --> 22:33.435

{\an8}OVER THE CUTE GIRL
THAT PAULY BRINGS HOME,

25:04.169 --> 25:06.922
{\an8}BECAUSE HOT GIRLS ARE BORING
A LOT OF THE TIMES.

25:07.005 --> 25:09.257
{\an8}THEY SIT THERE. "I'M HOT.
I DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING."

25:09.341 --> 25:11.760

PAUL?

26:04.729 --> 26:07.023
{\an8}- I DON'T KNOW
IF GUIDOS SHOULD CAMP.

26:07.107 --> 26:08.650
{\an8}MAYBE I'LL DO
SOMETHING ELSE.

26:08.733 --> 26:09.776
{\an8}I'M NOT INTO THE WHOLE

26:09.859 --> 26:12.404
{\an8}SLEEPING OUTSIDE,
NO MIRROR, NO BATHROOM,

26:12.487 --> 26:13.738
{\an8}CAN'T DO MY BLOWOUT.

26:13.822 --> 26:15.073
{\an8}GUIDOS DO NOT
BELONG CAMPING.

26:15.156 --> 26:16.992
{\an8}I'VE NEVER SEEN A GUIDO CAMP,
EVER.

26:17.075 --> 26:19.828
{\an8}- WHY WON'T YOU GO CAMPING?
I'M JUST KIDDING.

26:19.911 --> 26:20.620
{\an8}- I DON'T WANT TO GO.

26:20.704 --> 26:23.123
{\an8}- GOT BATTERIES.
- GOT BLOW POPS?

26:23.206 --> 26:23.915
{\an8}- YES, I DO.

26:23.999 --> 26:25.542
{\an8}- YOU'RE BRINGING CONDOMS?

26:25.625 --> 26:26.835
{\an8}- SHAMPOO.

26:26.918 --> 26:29.004
{\an8}- I PICKED THE ONLY THING GREEN.
- WE'RE GONNA BLEND IN.

26:29.087 --> 26:30.463
{\an8}- [laughs]

26:30.547 --> 26:32.382
{\an8}- SAY I SEE A BEAR.
I'M GONNA BE LIKE...

26:32.465 --> 26:34.217
{\an8}AND HE WON'T SEE ME.

26:34.301 --> 26:37.220
{\an8}- â™ª SO YOU CAN FIND ME â™ª

26:37.304 --> 26:40.181
{\an8}â™ª IF ONLY YOU
COULD EVER SEE â™ª

26:40.265 --> 26:42.392
{\an8}- LET'S GO!

26:42.475 --> 26:45.812
{\an8}- WHOO,

26:45.895 --> 26:48.648
{\an8}- YAY!

27:03.955 --> 27:04.873
{\an8}- YES!

27:04.956 --> 27:07.208
{\an8}WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?
- I DON'T KNOW.

27:07.292 --> 27:09.669
{\an8}- YO, LET'S TURN THIS PLACE
INTO SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

27:09.753 --> 27:11.379
{\an8}- I WANT TO TURN THIS PLACE
UNRECOGNIZABLE.

27:11.463 --> 27:13.173
{\an8}- YEAH.
- WHEN THEY WALK IN.

27:13.256 --> 27:14.299
{\an8}- THESE CAMPERS ARE SUCKERS.

27:14.382 --> 27:15.508
{\an8}THEY THOUGHT I DIDN'T WANT
TO GO CAMPING.

27:15.592 --> 27:17.552
{\an8}LITTLE DO THEY KNOW
ME AND VINNY

27:17.635 --> 27:19.220
{\an8}JUST WANTED THE HOUSE
TO OURSELVES,

27:19.304 --> 27:21.014
{\an8}BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA PRANK
THE SHIT OUTTA THEM.

27:21.097 --> 27:22.515
{\an8}BUT THIS HAS TO BE
THE PRANK OF ALL PRANKS,

27:22.599 --> 27:24.517
{\an8}THE MASSIVE PRANK,
THE BIG PRANK.

27:24.601 --> 27:26.227
{\an8}BIGGEST PRANK WE'VE EVER
PULLED IN OUR LIFE.

27:26.311 --> 27:27.645
{\an8}NOW WE CAN DO
WHATEVER THE HELL WE WANT.

27:27.729 --> 27:30.315
{\an8}- WE CAN MOVE
THE WHOLE OUTSIDE INSIDE...

27:30.398 --> 27:32.359
{\an8}- [laughs]

27:32.442 --> 27:33.360
{\an8}- YUP.

27:33.443 --> 27:34.944
{\an8}TURN THE HOUSE INSIDE OUT,
LITERALLY.

27:35.028 --> 27:36.154
{\an8}- YEAH.

27:36.237 --> 27:37.739
{\an8}- WHEN ME AND PAULY
DO A PRANK,

27:37.822 --> 27:40.909
{\an8}IT IS ELABORATE, LIKE WE'RE
BUILDING A FUCKING HOUSE.

27:40.992 --> 27:42.285
{\an8}- THIS IS GONNA TAKE
SOME TIME.

27:42.369 --> 27:45.205
{\an8}- I KNOW. WE NEED, LIKE,
SPECIAL RECRUITS OR SOMETHING.

27:45.288 --> 27:46.247

ANIMOSITY TOWARDS THE MEATBALLS,

{\an8}AND I KNOW THEY DONE
SOME STUFF TO YOU TOO,

28:02.847 --> 28:04.474
{\an8}SO I WANT TO GET YOU INVOLVED,
THE MEATBALLS AS WELL.

28:04.557 --> 28:06.101
{\an8}- THE MEATBALLS
PLAYED ME REALLY BAD.

28:06.184 --> 28:08.019
{\an8}- THEY'RE LIKE, "OH, PAULY

28:08.103 --> 28:09.771
{\an8}YES, BECAUSE WE'RE
GOING TO PRANK THE HOUSE.

28:09.854 --> 28:12.232
{\an8}BIG-TIME.
- THE ULTIMATE PRANK EVER.

28:12.315 --> 28:13.358
{\an8}- WE NEED SOME EMPLOYEES,
EVERYTHING.

28:13.441 --> 28:14.984
{\an8}- I'M IN IF IT'S AGAINST
THE MEATBALLS.

28:46.516 --> 28:48.309
{\an8}- THIS IS GONNA BE FUN.

28:48.393 --> 28:50.311
{\an8}- SO WE'RE GOING

28:59.737 --> 29:00.864
{\an8}THIS IS THE WILDERNESS,
RIGHT?

29:00.947 --> 29:04.367
{\an8}THIS IS REALLY
NOT WHAT I WAS EXPECTING.

29:04.451 --> 29:05.660
{\an8}- LET'S SET UP OUR TENT.

29:05.743 --> 29:08.872
{\an8}- LET'S MAKE A DRINK FIRST.
[laughs]

29:08.955 --> 29:10.206
{\an8}- OH, SHIT.

29:10.290 --> 29:13.918
{\an8}THERE'S DEFINITELY DIRECTIONS

29:14.002 --> 29:16.004
{\an8}I DON'T MIND
PUTTING TOGETHER THE TENT,

29:16.087 --> 29:19.299
{\an8}BUT, UH,
IT IS A LOT OF WORK.

29:19.382 --> 29:20.508
{\an8}TAKES A LOT
TO PITCH MY TENT.

29:20.592 --> 29:23.553
{\an8}[scoffs]
PRETTY BIG.

29:23.636 --> 29:25.513
{\an8}- THIS GOES IN THE GROUND.

29:25.597 --> 29:27.140
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT, SO THIS IS THE TOP.

COMES OUT NICE.

29:50.038 --> 29:51.289
{\an8}HOW DID YOU GET YOURS UP?

29:51.372 --> 29:53.541
{\an8}- 'CAUSE I KNOW
HOW TO SET UP TENTS.

29:53.625 --> 29:55.460
{\an8}- LOSER.
GUIDO PROBLEMS.

29:55.543 --> 29:58.379
{\an8}- I'M FROM THE BRONX, OKAY?

29:58.463 --> 30:01.341
{\an8}THE CLOSEST THING I SEE
TO PEOPLE CAMPING OUTSIDE

30:01.424 --> 30:02.967
{\an8}ARE HOMELESS PEOPLE.

30:03.051 --> 30:04.886
{\an8}LOOKS NOTHING LIKE A TENT.

30:04.969 --> 30:06.596
{\an8}- [laughs]

30:06.679 --> 30:07.764
{\an8}- WE'RE GONNA REMOVE
THE COUCHES,

30:07.847 --> 30:09.432
{\an8}REMOVE THE BEAN BAG,
REMOVE THE CHAIRS.

30:09.516 --> 30:11.309
{\an8}THIS PRANK IS GONNA TAKE
SOME WORK, SOME HARD WORK.

30:11.392 --> 30:13.394
{\an8}THERE'S ENOUGH ROOM UPSTAIRS
TO FIT ALL THE BEDROOMS.

30:13.478 --> 30:14.896
{\an8}THAT'S SHOCK FACTOR
RIGHT THERE.

30:14.979 --> 30:17.148
{\an8}THEY'RE NOT GONNA BE
OUR FRIENDS ANYMORE AFTER THIS.

30:23.446 --> 30:26.783
{\an8}- IT'S ABOUT TO GO DOWN.

30:26.866 --> 30:28.409
{\an8}- WE'RE GONNA REMOVE
THE COUCHES.

30:28.493 --> 30:29.744
{\an8}- REMOVE THE COUCHES, RIGHT?

30:29.827 --> 30:31.371
{\an8}- REMOVE THE BEAN BAG,
REMOVE THE CHAIRS.

30:31.454 --> 30:32.539
{\an8}EMPTY THIS BAD BOY OUT.

30:32.622 --> 30:34.832
{\an8}- ME AND PAULY GOT EVERYONE
OUT OF THE HOUSE,

30:34.916 --> 30:37.085
{\an8}AND NOW WE ARE
GOING TO FLIP THIS HOUSE

30:37.168 --> 30:38.169
{\an8}INSIDE OUT, LITERALLY.

30:38.253 --> 30:41.256
{\an8}- SO THE COUCHES
ARE GONNA BE JUST LIKE THIS,

30:41.339 --> 30:42.257
{\an8}LIKE A "L."

30:42.340 --> 30:44.425
{\an8}THIS PRANK
ISN'T A SIMPLE PRANK.

30:44.509 --> 30:45.677
{\an8}THIS PRANK IS GONNA
TAKE SOME WORK,

30:45.760 --> 30:47.929
{\an8}SOME HARD WORK,
BUT WELL WORTH IT.

30:48.012 --> 30:49.931
{\an8}PRANK WARS!
[laughs]

30:50.014 --> 30:52.141
{\an8}THEY'RE NOT GONNA BE OUR FRIENDS
ANYMORE AFTER THIS.

30:52.225 --> 30:53.142
{\an8}- NO, I KNOW.

30:53.226 --> 30:54.477
{\an8}THIS SHIT IS HEAVY.

30:54.561 --> 30:56.020
{\an8}IT'S JUST ME AND PAULY,

30:56.104 --> 30:59.315
{\an8}AND WE ARE LIFTING COUCHES
AND TABLES,

30:59.399 --> 31:01.442
{\an8}AND WE ARE, LIKE,
ARRANGING FURNITURE.

31:01.526 --> 31:02.610
{\an8}- WHEW.
YEAH, BUDDY.

31:02.694 --> 31:05.321
{\an8}- THIS NOT ONLY TAKES MUSCLE;

31:05.405 --> 31:07.699
{\an8}IT TAKES BRAINS,
AND IT IS EXHAUSTING.

31:07.782 --> 31:09.993
{\an8}- THIS IS PRETTY BIG, YOU KNOW.
58 INCHES.

31:10.076 --> 31:11.202
{\an8}- OBVIOUSLY, WE CAN'T FIT
THE JACUZZI INSIDE THE DOOR,

31:11.286 --> 31:13.496
{\an8}SO WE GOT, LIKE,

31:13.580 --> 31:17.458
{\an8}A BABY POOL TO MAKE BELIEVE
IT'S THE JACUZZI.

31:17.542 --> 31:21.546
{\an8}[chuckles]

31:28.052 --> 31:30.346
{\an8}- THIS KIDDIE POOL
IS NO JOKE,

31:30.430 --> 31:31.723
{\an8}BUT TEAMWORK
MAKES THE DREAM WORK.

31:31.806 --> 31:32.515
{\an8}COME ON, BRO.

31:32.599 --> 31:35.685
{\an8}GIVE IT ONE
GOOD, HARD BLOW.

31:35.768 --> 31:37.687
{\an8}PINCH IT WITH YOUR TEETH
A LITTLE BIT. LETS THE AIR IN.

31:37.770 --> 31:40.648
{\an8}- [laughing]

31:40.732 --> 31:41.691
{\an8}[pool hisses]

31:41.774 --> 31:43.484
{\an8}SEE HOW HARD
IT'S COMING OUT, BRO?

31:43.568 --> 31:47.530
{\an8}[both laugh]

31:47.614 --> 31:51.242
{\an8}- SUCKER MC.

31:54.078 --> 31:56.247
{\an8}- YOU'RE NOT
LIGHTING THE FIRE NOW.

31:56.331 --> 31:58.041
{\an8}- I JUST WANT TO SEE
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.

31:58.124 --> 31:59.792
{\an8}THROW A LITTLE BIT
OF THAT ON THERE.

31:59.876 --> 32:02.795
{\an8}YEAH, WE CAN COOK
ON THE STOVE LIKE THAT.

32:02.879 --> 32:04.380
{\an8}- EWW, RON.

32:04.464 --> 32:05.590
{\an8}- AHH.

32:05.673 --> 32:08.343
{\an8}- EWW, STOP THAT.

32:08.426 --> 32:10.136
{\an8}- UGH.

32:10.219 --> 32:11.888
{\an8}- EWW.

32:11.971 --> 32:14.641
{\an8}- OH!
- YOU SICK--YOU FUCKING--

32:14.724 --> 32:16.601
{\an8}- OH, MY GOD!
[laughs]

32:16.684 --> 32:17.685
{\an8}- I FEEL LIKE I'M GONNA BLOW UP
FOR SOME REASON.

32:17.769 --> 32:20.521
{\an8}- SERIOUSLY.
- I REALLY DO.

32:20.605 --> 32:22.023
{\an8}- THAT COULD'VE BEEN DANGEROUS.

32:24.484 --> 32:26.527
{\an8}- YOU GOT IT, NICK?
- YEAH.

32:26.611 --> 32:28.071
{\an8}[knocking at door]

32:28.154 --> 32:30.865
{\an8}- IS THAT THE DOOR?

32:30.948 --> 32:32.700
{\an8}WELCOME TO PRANK WARS.
HOW CAN I HELP YOU?

32:32.784 --> 32:35.036
{\an8}- WE BROUGHT
SOME SUPPLIES, GUYS.

32:35.119 --> 32:36.287
{\an8}- WE GOT SOME SUPPLIES?
NICE.

32:36.371 --> 32:38.039
{\an8}WE NEED MORE BACKUP.
WE'RE DYING.

32:38.122 --> 32:39.540
{\an8}- NICE!

32:39.624 --> 32:41.376
{\an8}- WHAT THE HELL
DID YOU GUYS DO IN HERE?

32:41.459 --> 32:42.043
{\an8}THERE'S NOTHING IN HERE.

32:42.126 --> 32:43.503
{\an8}- DANNY COMES OVER,

32:43.586 --> 32:44.879
{\an8}AND HE BRINGS THE MANPOWER.

32:44.962 --> 32:47.048
{\an8}HE BRINGS SOME GUYS
FROM THE T-SHIRT SHOP,

32:47.131 --> 32:47.548
{\an8}AND HE ALSO BRINGS ASTROTURF.

32:47.632 --> 32:49.884
{\an8}GOLF, ANYONE?

32:49.967 --> 32:50.927
{\an8}'CAUSE WE'RE GONNA ASTROTURF
THE WHOLE LIVING ROOM

32:51.010 --> 32:53.346
{\an8}TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE
THE UPSTAIRS DECK.

32:53.429 --> 32:54.597
{\an8}ALL RIGHT,
SO THEN THE BAR WILL GO THERE.

32:54.681 --> 32:55.848
{\an8}JACUZZI WILL GO THERE?

32:55.932 --> 32:57.725
{\an8}THEN WE'LL SET UP
THE COUCHES AND STUFF HERE.

32:57.809 --> 32:58.726
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT.
SWEET.

32:58.810 --> 32:59.936
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT,
SO LET'S GO.

33:00.019 --> 33:01.270
{\an8}- YOU WANT TO GET
THE STUFF FROM UP TOP?

33:01.354 --> 33:02.563
{\an8}- YEAH, YEAH,
LET'S SET UP THE PARTY DECK.

33:02.647 --> 33:03.898
{\an8}- SHOULD WE PAINT
THE WALLS BLUE?

33:03.981 --> 33:04.899
{\an8}- OH, YEAH.

33:04.982 --> 33:06.109
{\an8}- IT'S GONNA BE AWESOME

33:06.192 --> 33:07.902
{\an8}LOOKING DOWN THERE,
THOUGH, WITH THIS THING.

33:07.985 --> 33:09.195
{\an8}'CAUSE THAT'S
HOW OFFICIAL--

33:09.278 --> 33:10.905
{\an8}THAT'S HOW ELABORATE
THIS PRANK IS.

33:10.988 --> 33:12.407
{\an8}THAT'S SHOCK FACTOR
RIGHT THERE.

33:12.490 --> 33:14.575
{\an8}- WATCH THAT MIRROR.
YOU DON'T NEED SEVEN YEARS.

33:14.659 --> 33:16.411
{\an8}- YOU'RE GONNA SEE A HAMMOCK
IN THE LIVING ROOM.

33:16.494 --> 33:18.496
{\an8}YOU'RE GONNA SEE A POOL
IN THE LIVING ROOM.

33:18.579 --> 33:20.456
{\an8}YOU'RE GONNA SEE
THAT YOUR BED IS UPSTAIRS.

33:20.540 --> 33:21.541
{\an8}AND THEN WHEN YOU WALK
INTO YOUR ROOM,

33:21.624 --> 33:22.959
{\an8}WE DIDN'T JUST
TAKE HALF YOUR STUFF.

33:23.042 --> 33:26.587
{\an8}WE MADE YOUR ROOM
COMPLETELY EMPTY.

33:26.671 --> 33:27.505
{\an8}THIS IS AWESOME.

33:27.588 --> 33:28.840
{\an8}THANKS FOR YOUR HELP, GUYS.
[laughs]

33:28.923 --> 33:30.842
{\an8}WHEN THE ROOMMATES WALK IN,
THEY'RE GONNA BE LIKE,

33:30.925 --> 33:32.552
{\an8}"OH, MY GOD.
WHAT DID THEY DO?"

33:32.635 --> 33:33.469
{\an8}- LATER, GUYS.
THANKS A LOT, MAN.

33:33.553 --> 33:34.470
{\an8}- THANK YOU SO MUCH.
- THANK YOU.

33:34.554 --> 33:36.097
{\an8}- I GOTTA KNOW
EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED.

33:36.180 --> 33:37.014
{\an8}YOU GOTTA COME BY AND TELL US.
- YOU GOT IT.

33:37.098 --> 33:40.643
{\an8}- VICTORY
FOR THE PRANK WARS.

33:40.727 --> 33:43.104
{\an8}- THEY'LL NEVER BE ABLE
TO TOP THIS EVER, EVER.

33:43.187 --> 33:44.439
{\an8}NOBODY CAN.
- EVER.

33:44.522 --> 33:46.190
{\an8}- GOOD LUCK.
- LATER.

33:46.274 --> 33:50.445
{\an8}NOT BAD FOR A DJ AND A COUPLE
OF T-SHIRT PRESSERS.

33:57.368 --> 33:59.704
{\an8}- THERE YOU GO.

33:59.787 --> 34:01.122
{\an8}- REALLY?
THAT'S NOT GONNA BURN.

34:01.205 --> 34:02.915
{\an8}- HELL, YEAH,
THAT'S GONNA FUCKING BURN.

34:02.999 --> 34:04.125
{\an8}- MOIST.

34:04.208 --> 34:06.127
{\an8}- THAT'S GONNA BURN.
YOU KIDDING ME?

34:06.210 --> 34:08.463
{\an8}I'M ACTUALLY
FASCINATED WITH FIRE,

34:08.545 --> 34:10.630
{\an8}FASCINATED WITH, YOU KNOW,

34:10.715 --> 34:11.340
{\an8}DANGER AND RISK
AND ALL THAT STUFF.

34:11.424 --> 34:14.302
{\an8}COME ON.

34:14.385 --> 34:17.346
{\an8}SO IT'S ONLY RIGHT
THAT I BUILD THE FIRE.

34:17.429 --> 34:19.306
{\an8}- I FEEL LIKE THAT'S
A TREE THAT'S ALIVE.

34:19.389 --> 34:21.225
{\an8}- NO.

34:21.309 --> 34:22.810
{\an8}- IT HAS GREEN LEAVES.

34:22.893 --> 34:24.312
{\an8}- YEAH, THAT'S--
- YOU JUST KILLED A TREE.

34:24.395 --> 34:26.105
{\an8}- HOW ARE YOU JUST
GONNA SAY IT'S DEAD?

34:26.188 --> 34:28.983
{\an8}MM! I DON'T WANT
TO BURN ALIVE.

34:29.067 --> 34:32.820
{\an8}MIKE, PUT DOWN
THE FREAKIN' FIRE.

34:32.904 --> 34:34.405
{\an8}HE'S LIKE
ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE,

34:34.489 --> 34:36.324
{\an8}A HERMAPHRODITE
OR WHATEVER IT IS.

34:36.407 --> 34:38.618
{\an8}- THERE WE GO.

34:38.701 --> 34:39.869
{\an8}- SOMETHING'S GOING ON.

34:39.952 --> 34:42.914
{\an8}- THAT POOR TREE.

34:59.764 --> 35:01.140
{\an8}- ARE YOU IN YOUR
PARANOID STATE, MIKE?

35:07.105 --> 35:09.232
{\an8}- ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN
IN THE WOODS.

35:09.315 --> 35:10.775
{\an8}I DEFINITELY
FEEL VULNERABLE.

35:10.858 --> 35:11.692
{\an8}I MEAN, JASON COULD COME OUT,
ANYTHING.

35:11.776 --> 35:14.695
{\an8}- WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM?

35:14.779 --> 35:17.865
{\an8}- WHY ARE YOU BEING WEIRD?
- I DON'T KNOW.

35:17.949 --> 35:19.242
{\an8}I FEEL LIKE SOMEBODY'S ABOUT

35:19.325 --> 35:20.910
{\an8}TO JUMP OUT OF ONE
OF THESE TENTS.

35:20.993 --> 35:23.037
{\an8}- WE'RE ALL RIGHT HERE.

35:23.120 --> 35:24.747
{\an8}WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

35:24.831 --> 35:27.166
{\an8}- I KEEP HEARING NOISES.

35:27.250 --> 35:30.378
{\an8}- 'CAUSE WE'RE IN THE WOODS?
- THAT'S TRUE.

35:30.461 --> 35:31.712
{\an8}- MIKE IS A SCHIZO
RIGHT NOW.

35:31.796 --> 35:34.215
{\an8}HE'S SO PARANOID,
HE'S FREAKING ME OUT.

35:34.298 --> 35:35.591
{\an8}HE MAKES ME FEEL
NOT NORMAL.

35:35.675 --> 35:37.885
{\an8}WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

35:37.969 --> 35:40.805
{\an8}- MIKE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

35:40.888 --> 35:41.848
{\an8}- I DON'T KNOW;
I KEEP FEELING

35:41.931 --> 35:44.308
{\an8}LIKE SOMETHING'S
BY MY FUCKING TENT.

35:44.392 --> 35:45.893
{\an8}THIS IS THE WILDERNESS, OKAY?

35:45.977 --> 35:47.728
{\an8}A BEAR CAN COME OUT.
ANYTHING COULD HAPPEN.

35:47.812 --> 35:49.272
{\an8}- WHAT ARE YOU DOING, MIKE?

35:49.355 --> 35:51.440
{\an8}- GUIDOS DON'T BELONG
IN THE WOODS.

35:51.524 --> 35:52.984
{\an8}zip!

35:53.067 --> 35:54.569
{\an8}- BEFORE EVERYBODY
GETS TOO DRUNK,

35:54.652 --> 35:56.737
{\an8}WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT
WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE HOUSE.

35:56.821 --> 35:58.114
{\an8}- [laughs]
WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE HOUSE?

35:58.197 --> 36:01.075
{\an8}- MAYBE IT'S JUST ME BEING,
LIKE, WHATEVER, BUT, LIKE,

36:01.158 --> 36:03.452
{\an8}IN ITALY, WE ALWAYS HAD
GIRLS' NIGHTS.

36:03.536 --> 36:05.246
{\an8}WE DON'T EVEN
DO THAT ANYMORE.

36:05.329 --> 36:08.249
{\an8}LIKE, ME AND YOU
HAVE OUR MEATBALL DAYS.

36:08.332 --> 36:10.126
{\an8}BUT SOMETIMES
I FEEL LIKE I LOST YOU.

36:10.209 --> 36:11.919
{\an8}I MISS ALL YOU GIRLS,
'CAUSE, LIKE,

36:12.003 --> 36:13.588
{\an8}NOW YOU HAVE ALL BOYFRIENDS.

36:13.671 --> 36:17.592
{\an8}I'M USUALLY IN AN ENVIRONMENT
WHERE I'M WITH MY SINGLE GIRLS

36:17.675 --> 36:19.927
{\an8}AND WE'RE ALL DOING
THE SAME THING.

36:20.011 --> 36:21.554
{\an8}HERE, IT'S COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT.

36:21.637 --> 36:24.473
{\an8}- WHAT, YOU CAN'T HANG OUT
WITH THEM AND HAVE A GOOD TIME?

36:24.557 --> 36:25.516
{\an8}- I CAN.
- SO WHY DON'T YOU?

36:25.600 --> 36:27.643
{\an8}- A COUPLE NIGHTS,
ME AND YOU WERE DANCING.

36:27.727 --> 36:29.770
{\an8}AS SOON AS JIONNI CAME,

36:29.854 --> 36:31.689
{\an8}YOU TOOK OFF,
AND I WAS BY MYSELF.

36:31.772 --> 36:33.316
{\an8}- BUT HE CAME OVER
AND STARTED DANCING.

36:33.399 --> 36:34.525
{\an8}HE WAS BY US.

36:34.609 --> 36:36.110
{\an8}- I KNOW, BUT YOU JUST...
- AND YOU TOOK OFF.

36:36.193 --> 36:37.111
{\an8}- FLOCK TO HIM.

36:37.194 --> 36:38.404
{\an8}- 'CAUSE I WANTED TO SEE--

36:38.487 --> 36:39.363
{\an8}- I JUST DON'T LIKE
BEING TYPECAST AS--

36:39.447 --> 36:41.908
{\an8}BECAUSE I'M A GIRL
THAT HAS A MAN,

36:41.991 --> 36:44.035
{\an8}IT MEANS I DON'T HAVE FUN
OR I CAN'T DO MY THING.

36:44.118 --> 36:45.828
{\an8}WHEN I GO TO A CLUB--
- NO, I HAVE TO BE HONEST.

36:45.912 --> 36:47.204
{\an8}JENNI,
IF I HAD A BOYFRIEND,

36:47.288 --> 36:49.332
{\an8}I'D WISH IT WAS
LIKE YOU AND ROGER.

36:49.415 --> 36:50.625
{\an8}- MM.

36:50.708 --> 36:53.961
{\an8}- BUT WHEN IT COMES TO NICOLE,
LIKE, SOMETIMES, LIKE,

36:54.045 --> 36:55.796
{\an8}I FEEL LIKE I LOST
MY MEATBALL.

36:55.880 --> 36:57.506
{\an8}- YOU DIDN'T LOSE ME.
I'M IN LOVE. I'M SORRY.

36:57.590 --> 36:58.758
{\an8}DON'T MAKE ME
FEEL GUILTY FOR THAT.

36:58.841 --> 37:01.302
{\an8}I DEFINITELY KNOW
WHAT DEENA'S GOING THROUGH.

37:01.385 --> 37:02.803
{\an8}I MEAN, IF DEENA FOUND LOVE
AND I WAS ALONE,

37:02.887 --> 37:04.931
{\an8}I'D BE LIKE, "COOL," LIKE,
"YOU'RE HANGING OUT WITH HIM,

37:05.014 --> 37:06.766
{\an8}AND YOU'RE NOT WITH ME."

37:06.849 --> 37:07.767
{\an8}IT'S JEALOUSY.

37:07.850 --> 37:09.268
{\an8}- I'M NOT TRYING
TO MAKE YOU FEEL GUILTY.

37:09.352 --> 37:10.561
{\an8}- I'M HAPPY.

37:10.645 --> 37:11.646
{\an8}I'M HAPPY, AND NOBODY
THAT ANYBODY CAN--

37:11.729 --> 37:14.357
{\an8}LIKE, NOBODY CAN SAY OTHERWISE.
I'M HAPPY.

37:14.440 --> 37:15.775
{\an8}I'M STILL FRIENDS WITH YOU.

37:15.858 --> 37:17.318
{\an8}THE FACT THAT DEENA'S
UPSET RIGHT NOW,

37:17.401 --> 37:18.819
{\an8}I'M LIKE, UGH.

37:18.903 --> 37:19.987
{\an8}LIKE, I REALLY
WANT TO BE WITH JIONNI,

37:20.071 --> 37:22.448
{\an8}BUT THEN AGAIN,
I'M SAD THAT DEENA'S UPSET.

37:22.531 --> 37:24.200
{\an8}SO WHAT THE FUCK DO I DO?

37:24.283 --> 37:26.619
{\an8}- I GUESS THE POINT BEING,
EVERYONE THINKS

37:26.702 --> 37:28.829
{\an8}THAT ME AND NICOLE
HAVE CHANGED.

37:28.913 --> 37:30.206
{\an8}- SAM'S THERE REGARDLESS,

37:30.289 --> 37:33.125
{\an8}EVEN THOUGH ME AND HER FIGHT
LIKE A FUCKING WHATEVER.

37:33.209 --> 37:35.586
{\an8}- FUCK YOU.
I FUCKING HATE YOU.

37:35.670 --> 37:38.881
{\an8}[laughter]
- OH, MY GOD.

37:51.394 --> 37:53.187
{\an8}- DISGUSTING.
I HATE BUGS.

37:53.270 --> 37:56.107
{\an8}OH, MY GOD.
I CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE.

37:56.190 --> 37:57.441
{\an8}I REALLY--
I CAN'T.

37:57.525 --> 37:59.110
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET
THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.

37:59.193 --> 38:00.194
{\an8}- CAMPING IS ACTUALLY
HARD WORK.

38:00.277 --> 38:03.030
{\an8}I THOUGHT IT WAS
JUST GONNA BE, LIKE, FUN.

38:03.114 --> 38:04.532
{\an8}BUT NO, IT'S DISGUSTING.

38:04.615 --> 38:05.700
{\an8}THERE'S FLIES. THERE'S BUGS.
IT'S GROSS.

38:05.783 --> 38:07.868
{\an8}[gasping]

38:07.952 --> 38:09.036
{\an8}- YO, JUST HOLD
THE FUCKING THING.

38:09.120 --> 38:10.579
{\an8}- DADDY LONGLEGS EVERYWHERE.

38:10.663 --> 38:12.373
{\an8}- YEAH, THAT'S WHY
I WANT TO GET OUT OF HERE.

38:12.456 --> 38:14.959
{\an8}GRAB ANOTHER BAG.
HURRY UP. I'LL DO THIS QUICK.

38:15.042 --> 38:16.711
{\an8}CAMPING TRIP IS OVER.
IT'S TIME TO GO HOME.

38:16.794 --> 38:18.295
{\an8}COME ON. WE'RE ALMOST DONE.

38:18.379 --> 38:20.089
{\an8}THERE IS NO GYM,
THERE IS NO TANNING SALON,

38:20.172 --> 38:22.049
{\an8}AND YOU CAN'T DO YOUR LAUNDRY.

38:22.133 --> 38:24.510
{\an8}- OH, MY GOD.
- EWW!

38:24.593 --> 38:26.220
{\an8}- LOOK AT THIS SPIDER
ON MY FUCKING CLOTHES.

38:26.303 --> 38:28.389
{\an8}DID HE LAY EGGS
IN MY SHIRT?

38:28.472 --> 38:29.724
{\an8}- COME ON. LET'S DO THIS.

38:29.807 --> 38:31.225
{\an8}- CAN YOU HELP ME GET
THIS SPIDER OFF MY CLOTHES?

38:31.308 --> 38:32.351
{\an8}- OH, D--COME ON, JENNI.

38:32.435 --> 38:33.894
{\an8}I JUST CLEANED THIS WHOLE PLACE,
ALL RIGHT?

38:33.978 --> 38:34.895
{\an8}- ALL I WANT IS THE SPIDER
OFF MY CLOTHES.

38:34.979 --> 38:36.397
{\an8}- ALL I WANT
IS TO GET OUT OF HERE

38:36.480 --> 38:37.565
{\an8}AND FOR PEOPLE TO HELP.

38:37.648 --> 38:39.233
{\an8}- I FUCKING HELP
EVERY FUCKING DAY IN THIS HOUSE.

38:39.317 --> 38:41.777
{\an8}I'M ASKING TO GET
A FUCKING SPIDER...

38:41.861 --> 38:43.029
{\an8}- JENNI,
I'M NOT HATING ON YOU.

38:43.112 --> 38:44.280
{\an8}- OFF MY CLOTHES
SO I CAN GET DRESSED.

38:44.363 --> 38:45.906
{\an8}- I'M NOT HATING ON YOU, GIRL.
- YOU ARE HATING.

38:45.990 --> 38:46.991
{\an8}YOU JUST SAID IT.

38:47.074 --> 38:48.659
{\an8}- I'M TRYING TO GET
OUT OF HERE, OKAY?

38:48.743 --> 38:49.744
{\an8}IT'S A FACT.

38:49.827 --> 38:50.745
{\an8}RIGHT NOW,
YOU'RE A LITTLE TIRED.

38:50.828 --> 38:52.079
{\an8}OKAY, YOU DON'T HAVE TO HELP.

38:52.163 --> 38:53.414
{\an8}I'M DOING IT ALL. COOL.
- I DON'T WANT TO HELP.

38:53.497 --> 38:54.665
{\an8}- GET YOUR SHIT, THEN.

38:54.749 --> 38:56.375
{\an8}- I WANT TO GET THE FUCKING
INSECTS OFF MY SHIT.

38:56.459 --> 38:59.420
{\an8}- CALLED CLEANING UP,
SPEEDY CLEANUP.

38:59.503 --> 39:01.172
{\an8}- JUST GET OFF.

39:01.255 --> 39:05.426
{\an8}- TIRED OF CLEANING UP
AND TWO PEOPLE HELPING.

39:05.509 --> 39:06.886
{\an8}- YOU KNOW,
WE'RE WINDING DOWN.

39:06.969 --> 39:08.512
{\an8}WE'RE COMING
TO OUR LAST FEW DAYS HERE.

39:08.596 --> 39:10.473
{\an8}AND I FEEL LIKE WE'VE BEEN
AROUND EACH OTHER FOR SO LONG

39:10.556 --> 39:12.391
{\an8}THAT WE'RE JUST
SICK OF EACH OTHER.

39:12.475 --> 39:15.102
{\an8}- IF I EVER GO CAMPING AGAIN,
IT WON'T BE IN A TENT.

39:15.186 --> 39:18.314
{\an8}- OR WITH MIKE.

39:21.692 --> 39:22.985
{\an8}- MARCO!

39:23.069 --> 39:24.820
{\an8}- [tiny voice] POLO.

39:24.904 --> 39:26.655
{\an8}- MARCO!

39:26.739 --> 39:27.782
{\an8}- [deep voice] POLO.

39:27.865 --> 39:30.284
{\an8}- CHEERS, BRO.
- BIGGEST PRANK WAR IN HISTORY.

39:30.367 --> 39:32.203
{\an8}- BIGGEST PRANK EVER.
NO TURNING BACK NOW.

39:32.286 --> 39:33.120
{\an8}-<i> SALUT.</i>

39:33.204 --> 39:34.330
{\an8}YOU'RE NOW
MY PRANK BROTHER.

39:34.413 --> 39:35.456
{\an8}IT'S ABOUT
TO GO DOWN RIGHT NOW,

39:35.539 --> 39:38.667
{\an8}'CAUSE THE SECOND
THEY OPEN THAT DOOR...

39:38.751 --> 39:40.711
{\an8}BAM!

39:40.795 --> 39:42.296
{\an8}WE CHANGED THE WHOLE HOUSE
INSIDE OUT.

39:42.379 --> 39:44.131
{\an8}WE PUT THE INSIDE OUTSIDE,
THE OUTSIDE INSIDE,

39:44.215 --> 39:45.633
{\an8}THE INSIDE OUTSIDE,
THE OUTSIDE INSIDE,

39:45.716 --> 39:47.635
{\an8}SO NOW OUR INSIDE DECK
IS NOW OUR OUTSIDE DECK.

39:47.718 --> 39:48.677
{\an8}OUR OUTSIDE DECK
IS NOW OUR INSIDE DECK,

39:48.761 --> 39:52.431
{\an8}AND, BASICALLY,
WE PRANKED THE WHOLE DAMN HOUSE.

39:52.515 --> 39:54.058
{\an8}I TOLD 'EM
NOT TO GO CAMPING.

39:54.141 --> 39:57.478
{\an8}- I WANT A SHOWER SO BAD.

39:57.561 --> 40:00.189
{\an8}- [laughs]
- DON'T HIT IT SO HARD.

40:00.272 --> 40:02.942
{\an8}- I'M DEAD.
- ME TOO.

40:03.025 --> 40:03.984
{\an8}- THIS IS THE LIFE, BRO.

40:04.068 --> 40:05.820
{\an8}- I WONDER WHAT
THE POOR PEOPLE ARE DOING.

40:05.903 --> 40:07.488
{\an8}- [sighs]

40:07.571 --> 40:09.156
{\an8}- THIS IS IT.
DON'T GET SCARED NOW.

40:09.240 --> 40:10.324
{\an8}YOU GOT MY BACK?
- I'M NOT.

40:10.407 --> 40:14.245
{\an8}- THIS IS WHERE WARRIORS
ARE MADE OF, RIGHT HERE.

40:15.913 --> 40:16.580
{\an8}- WHAT IS THIS?

40:19.250 --> 40:20.209
{\an8}- AND CUE THE SCREAM.

40:20.292 --> 40:21.418
{\an8}- MY GOD.

40:21.502 --> 40:24.088
{\an8}- THIS IS NOT COOL.
ALL MY SHIT'S RUINED.

40:24.171 --> 40:25.005
{\an8}- MIKE <i> REALLY</i> HATES IT.

40:25.089 --> 40:27.007
{\an8}- OH, YEAH, THIS IS GREAT.

40:27.091 --> 40:29.510
{\an8}- I WANT LESBIANS.

40:29.593 --> 40:30.594
{\an8}WHAT BETTER CHALLENGE

40:30.678 --> 40:31.595
{\an8}THAN A GIRL
THAT DOESN'T LIKE PENIS?

40:31.679 --> 40:33.973
{\an8}I'LL BRING MY PILLOW.
- [laughs]

40:34.056 --> 40:35.015
{\an8}MY MAN VINNY'S
ABOUT TO DO THE IMPOSSIBLE.

40:35.099 --> 40:36.475
{\an8}- WELCOME ABOARD.

40:36.559 --> 40:38.227
{\an8}[loud electronic beep]
- IT'S OUR LAST DAY.

40:38.310 --> 40:40.437
{\an8}- FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER,

40:40.521 --> 40:42.398
{\an8}I AM GOING TO MISS
THE SHORE HOUSE.

40:42.481 --> 40:44.483
{\an8}- SO LONG, BRO.
- GOOD-BYE, SMUSH.

40:44.567 --> 40:45.860
{\an8}BYE, STDs.
