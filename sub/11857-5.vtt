WEBVTT

00:23.625 --> 00:27.083
Do I miss you?
Only when I breathe.

00:27.166 --> 00:29.125
Take-out Tuesday,
Brent, your favorite.

00:29.208 --> 00:31.000
Take-out Tuesday, my favorite.

00:31.083 --> 00:33.417
- Ruby, off the phone.
- I got to go.

00:33.500 --> 00:36.041
(female #1)
'Ruby, it's almost 6:30.'

00:36.125 --> 00:38.375
It's not like you didn't see
the boy a couple of hours ago.

00:38.458 --> 00:40.208
Yeah. Me too.

00:40.291 --> 00:41.875
Totally.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.959
- Doug says hi.
- Hi, Doug.

00:44.041 --> 00:46.083
His parents
still on the outs?

00:46.166 --> 00:48.250
If that's what
you want to call
it.

00:48.333 --> 00:50.667
We're going to
study
later, if that's
okay?

00:50.750 --> 00:52.125
Study?

00:52.208 --> 00:55.333
Yeah, dad, study. Over here.

00:55.417 --> 00:56.959
'Cause the racket
at his house makes
it

00:57.041 --> 00:58.291
like, totally impossible.

00:58.375 --> 01:00.917
Somehow I doubt
that's the only
reason.

01:06.583 --> 01:08.291
Can I just eat in
my room? I'm starving.

01:08.375 --> 01:10.417
Ruby, you can wait 30 seconds.

01:13.291 --> 01:16.458
Did you ever think that maybe
Sammy likes yellow, Brent?

01:16.542 --> 01:18.542
- No.
- Well, what if he does?

01:18.625 --> 01:20.041
What if he loves yellow?

01:20.125 --> 01:21.583
Ruby..

01:21.667 --> 01:24.000
I'm sure Sammy hates
yellow, just like you
do.

01:24.083 --> 01:25.875
Three red flakes,
two blue, one green.

01:25.959 --> 01:27.583
No yellow.
That's what Sammy likes.

01:27.667 --> 01:30.917
That's exactly what
Sammy will get because..

01:33.959 --> 01:35.500
Dinnertime.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.291
So this kid, Brent Harris?

02:26.375 --> 02:27.917
Yeah, one of the
orderlies
told me about him

02:28.000 --> 02:29.625
when I was here
on a DHS job.

02:29.709 --> 02:32.291
Uh, parents were
killed three years ago?

02:32.375 --> 02:33.667
Well, found in their car.

02:33.750 --> 02:35.959
.38 caliber rounds
to the chest, neck.

02:36.041 --> 02:37.208
Well, it says here
this kid, Brent

02:37.291 --> 02:38.250
was at home when it happened.

02:38.333 --> 02:39.667
But you think he
knows something?

02:39.750 --> 02:41.417
All I know is I
mention
his parents' murder

02:41.500 --> 02:42.959
and he blurts
out this
number.

02:43.041 --> 02:43.959
What kind of number?

02:44.041 --> 02:45.208
It's a long
one.
I don't know.

02:45.291 --> 02:46.583
Alright, we're
here for a number?

02:46.667 --> 02:47.917
Look, a lot of
people with
autism

02:48.000 --> 02:49.250
have photographic memories.

02:49.333 --> 02:51.375
Details matter, and I figured

02:51.458 --> 02:53.834
since I'm familiar
with this ace
detective..

02:53.917 --> 02:56.083
- You mean me, right?
- Yeah.

02:56.166 --> 02:58.000
I thought it'd be worth a shot.

02:59.667 --> 03:02.417
I should warn you, though.
He's,
uh...he's not real friendly.

03:02.500 --> 03:03.667
I ain't lookin' for a friend.

03:03.750 --> 03:05.208
He used to be real
high-functioning.

03:05.291 --> 03:06.417
- But not anymore?
- No.

03:06.500 --> 03:08.625
Not since his parents died.

03:11.208 --> 03:12.500
Good luck.

03:15.417 --> 03:16.750
Brent?

03:19.875 --> 03:23.542
I'm Detective Rush and this
is my partner, Detective
Valens.

03:25.125 --> 03:26.250
We want to talk to you
about what happened

03:26.333 --> 03:28.166
to your parents.

03:31.083 --> 03:34.291
They died...
three years
ago.

03:34.375 --> 03:37.875
- They were murdered.
- 0-6-5-7-3-9.1.

03:40.625 --> 03:41.792
What does that
number have to do

03:41.875 --> 03:43.291
with your
parents'
murder, Brent?

03:43.375 --> 03:45.709
0-6-5-7-3-9.1.

03:45.792 --> 03:48.458
Brent, did you
hear the question?

03:48.542 --> 03:51.291
'Brent, d-does that number
mean somethin' or what?'

03:55.166 --> 03:58.792
- 'It's a wild-goose chase.'
- Yeah.

03:58.875 --> 04:01.208
(Scotty)
'Kid doesn't even
understand the question.'

04:06.208 --> 04:08.125
It means something, Scotty.

04:08.208 --> 04:10.000
What?

04:10.083 --> 04:12.667
Harris' car,
night of the
murder?

04:12.750 --> 04:15.041
Look at
the odometer
reading.

04:17.750 --> 04:19.125
The same number
the kid's been saying.

04:19.208 --> 04:22.375
Down to the exact
tenth of a mile.

04:22.458 --> 04:24.208
Yeah, but that
car was impounded.

04:24.291 --> 04:26.333
How could he know that?

04:26.417 --> 04:28.333
'Cause he was there.

04:28.417 --> 04:29.625
He saw his parents murdered?

04:29.709 --> 04:32.166
0-6-5-7-3-9.1.

05:09.125 --> 05:10.375
Steve and Lisa Harris.

05:10.458 --> 05:12.500
Gunned down a block
away from their
house.

05:12.583 --> 05:14.250
Theory was
a carjacking gone wrong.

05:14.333 --> 05:16.834
Cold from the start.
No suspects, no
nothing.

05:16.917 --> 05:18.792
According to the daughter's
statement parents were on
their

05:18.875 --> 05:20.208
way to the local drive-through.

05:20.291 --> 05:22.834
These people had
some serious bad luck.

05:22.917 --> 05:24.458
Six months prior
to getting
whacked

05:24.542 --> 05:26.375
their tropical
fish
store burnt
down.

05:26.458 --> 05:27.792
Daughter said Brent
was with her at home

05:27.875 --> 05:29.542
waiting for her
parents to come
back.

05:29.625 --> 05:31.375
Well, now we know
he was in the car.

05:31.458 --> 05:33.166
- So why'd she lie?
- Good question.

05:33.250 --> 05:35.792
So this Brent,
can he count cards

05:35.875 --> 05:37.375
toothpicks, what?

05:37.458 --> 05:39.291
All we know is he
can't show emotion.

05:39.375 --> 05:42.291
Got to be rough, being
a parent to a kid like
that.

05:42.375 --> 05:43.959
No hugs, no affection.

05:44.041 --> 05:45.917
I can't imagine.

05:48.500 --> 05:51.500
Brent, your sister said
you were home with her.

05:51.583 --> 05:53.166
(Scotty)
'Why would she say that?'

05:55.583 --> 05:57.917
Did you see your
parents murdered,
Brent?

05:58.000 --> 06:00.125
0-6-5-7-3-9.1.

06:00.208 --> 06:01.542
(Scotty)
'Did you see who did it?'

06:01.625 --> 06:04.375
Do you remember anything
from that night, Brent?

06:04.458 --> 06:06.291
'Anything at all?'

06:09.834 --> 06:12.500
Look, you were
in the car,
Brent.

06:12.583 --> 06:17.125
You saw the odometer
number,
0-6-5-7-3-9.1.

06:19.959 --> 06:21.458
What did you see

06:21.542 --> 06:24.625
before

06:24.709 --> 06:26.083
(Lilly)
'What did you see
when the number'

06:26.166 --> 06:30.875
was 0-6-5-7-3-9.0?

06:31.583 --> 06:34.625
0-6-5-7-3-9.0.

06:34.709 --> 06:38.000
Yeah. What happened?

06:38.083 --> 06:40.166
The light turned red.

07:06.500 --> 07:07.875
(Scotty)
'"Are You High?"'

07:07.959 --> 07:10.500
Uh, the killer was
wearing those shoes, Brent?

07:10.583 --> 07:12.792
Is that what you're
trying to tell us?

07:19.750 --> 07:21.208
(Joseph)
Did he tell you anything
else?

07:21.291 --> 07:25.166
Yeah. Uh...
the killer's
shoes.

07:25.250 --> 07:28.041
"Are You High"
was written on them.

07:28.125 --> 07:30.375
"Are You High?"
I went there.

07:30.458 --> 07:31.834
- Come again.
- Ritter Union High School.

07:31.917 --> 07:33.166
That's what all
the kids called
it.

07:33.250 --> 07:36.000
So the doer went to
the same school as Brent.

07:36.083 --> 07:37.166
It's not
such
a bad idea

07:37.250 --> 07:38.667
me bringing you down here.

07:38.750 --> 07:41.041
- Serious lead on a double.
- N-not too shabby.

07:41.125 --> 07:43.458
Maybe you should deputize
me like in the Old West.

07:45.375 --> 07:47.834
Catch up with
you in a second?

07:51.000 --> 07:53.500
[sighs]
So, um..

07:53.583 --> 07:55.291
...I know it's been
kind of hectic lately.

07:55.375 --> 07:56.583
What's going on, Lil?

07:56.667 --> 07:58.291
An old friend's in trouble.

07:58.375 --> 07:59.291
What kind?

07:59.375 --> 08:00.750
Kind of long story. It's..

08:00.834 --> 08:03.333
No. I mean, what
kind of friend?

08:03.417 --> 08:04.375
He, uh..

08:06.667 --> 08:08.834
...he asked me
to marry him once.

08:10.250 --> 08:11.709
You never told me that.

08:11.792 --> 08:13.959
Just a dumb pipe dream.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.417
Ray's not
the settling down type.

08:17.500 --> 08:19.542
And you are?

08:19.625 --> 08:21.375
It doesn't matter.

08:21.458 --> 08:23.000
I'm here with you.

08:24.291 --> 08:25.375
Are you?

08:32.875 --> 08:36.500
Foster parents don't let me
out of this pit, but
whatever.

08:40.125 --> 08:42.291
I visit Brent every weekend.

08:42.375 --> 08:43.959
Barely says a word.

08:44.041 --> 08:45.500
How'd you guys
get him to open up?

08:45.583 --> 08:47.959
Asked him about
your parents'
murders.

08:48.041 --> 08:50.083
Rattled off a bunch of
numbers at the mention of it.

08:50.166 --> 08:52.250
I guess that's good, right?

08:52.333 --> 08:54.875
I mean, if he can do that,
maybe he'll be ready.

08:54.959 --> 08:55.917
Ready for what?

08:56.000 --> 08:57.792
Living with me.

08:57.875 --> 09:00.917
I'm turning 18, movin' out.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.375
You know, he's the only
family I've got left.

09:03.458 --> 09:04.834
So, why'd you lie
to the cops, Ruby?

09:04.917 --> 09:06.000
Say Brent was at home with you?

09:06.083 --> 09:09.125
I didn't lie.
He was home in his room.

09:09.208 --> 09:11.875
No possibility
you're wrong?

09:11.959 --> 09:14.250
I was on the phone.

09:14.333 --> 09:16.792
I just assumed. I mean,
it was take-out Tuesday.

09:16.875 --> 09:18.291
- "Take-out Tuesday?"
- 'Yeah.'

09:18.375 --> 09:20.625
Every Tuesday night,
my parents would bring back

09:20.709 --> 09:24.125
take-out while I stayed
home with Brent, unless..

09:24.208 --> 09:26.208
Unless what?

09:26.291 --> 09:29.500
To people with autism,
routine is everything.

09:29.583 --> 09:30.458
So?

09:30.542 --> 09:32.125
So sometimes, my parents

09:32.208 --> 09:33.500
would bring him along.

09:33.583 --> 09:35.291
You know, try to get
him used to change.

09:35.375 --> 09:37.750
So this could've
been a practice run?

09:37.834 --> 09:39.625
What does this have to do with
what happened to my mom and
dad?

09:39.709 --> 09:43.458
We think Brent was in the car
when the murders took place.

09:43.542 --> 09:45.542
- No.
- 'He saw the killer's
shoes.'

09:45.625 --> 09:48.583
The words "Are You High"
were graffitied on 'em.

09:48.667 --> 09:51.083
The guy who killed my parents
went to my high school?

09:51.166 --> 09:52.291
(Nick)
'Anyone come to mind?'

09:52.375 --> 09:53.500
Yeah.

09:53.583 --> 09:56.709
A big tagger. Even bigger jerk.

09:59.917 --> 10:01.917
(Brent)
'No touching! No, no.'

10:02.000 --> 10:03.166
Oh, crap.

10:03.250 --> 10:04.959
(Brent)
'No, no, no.'

10:05.041 --> 10:06.709
- Here we go again.
- Brent?

10:06.792 --> 10:08.417
Ruby to the rescue.

10:09.792 --> 10:12.333
I thought we was tight,
Brent, huh? Homies.

10:12.417 --> 10:13.709
I thought we
shared our
work.

10:13.792 --> 10:14.750
No-no-no touching.

10:14.834 --> 10:15.959
No touching. No touching.

10:16.041 --> 10:17.125
Now, give me the math homework.

10:17.208 --> 10:18.667
No touching!
No touching!

10:18.750 --> 10:20.291
Why you got to be getting
all selfish on me?

10:20.375 --> 10:23.458
- Withhold the love--
- Leave him alone!

10:23.542 --> 10:25.417
Little Miss Thang,
getting all gangsta.

10:25.500 --> 10:27.917
Look who's talking, moron.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.041
Stealing Brent's math
homework when you're, like,
19.

10:30.125 --> 10:33.041
At least I ain't the one
with dumbo in my family.

10:33.125 --> 10:37.041
No! You just act like you're
not lily-white from the
suburbs.

10:37.125 --> 10:38.208
Shut up before I cap you!

10:38.291 --> 10:39.583
Bring it on, dumbo!

10:39.667 --> 10:41.709
Hey, you want to
mess with my
girl?

10:41.792 --> 10:43.458
I-I ain't got no beef with you.

10:43.542 --> 10:45.375
See, you mess with Brent,
you mess with me.

10:45.458 --> 10:46.375
That goes for all of you.

10:46.458 --> 10:47.625
You touch my brother again

10:47.709 --> 10:49.417
and I will kill you!

10:49.500 --> 10:52.709
Not if I kill you first, skank.

10:52.792 --> 10:54.041
You say something,
punk-ass?

10:54.125 --> 10:55.667
No, dawg, I
ain't say nothing.

10:57.917 --> 10:58.959
I didn't think so.

11:07.083 --> 11:09.250
(Nick)
'You know what
happened to this jackass?'

11:09.333 --> 11:13.291
Yeah, he dropped out of school
after my parents were killed.

11:13.375 --> 11:14.875
So maybe he goes
after some payback

11:14.959 --> 11:17.625
on Ruby or Brent,
wearing those shoes.

11:17.709 --> 11:19.875
But the parents
got in the way.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.125
Got to say not bad

11:37.208 --> 11:39.500
'for a white kid
from the 'burbs.'

11:39.583 --> 11:42.583
Or for a punk beats up
on the special needs kids.

11:42.667 --> 11:44.250
I don't even know
what that means.

11:44.333 --> 11:46.917
Ruby Harris humiliates you
in front of all your
friends.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.583
And her parents
wind up dead.

11:48.667 --> 11:50.542
Ruby Harris..

11:50.625 --> 11:52.291
I do her?

11:52.375 --> 11:54.458
Brent Harris' sister.

11:55.667 --> 11:57.959
The autistic kid.

11:58.041 --> 12:00.125
- Oh, dumbo.
- 'Yeah, dumbo.'

12:00.208 --> 12:02.417
Who wouldn't let you
cheat off his math test.

12:02.500 --> 12:04.125
Why do you think I
dropped out of school?

12:04.208 --> 12:06.792
When dumbo's lapping you,
it's time to go.

12:06.875 --> 12:10.291
Killer wore shoes, like the
ones
you're wearing now, Greg.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.959
That's impossible. I mean,
these dogs ain't even that
old.

12:18.041 --> 12:19.291
I just made 'em this past year.

12:19.375 --> 12:20.625
So maybe you were
wearing a prototype.

12:20.709 --> 12:21.834
Lady, you know how
many pairs of shoes

12:21.917 --> 12:23.417
I've customized for people?

12:23.500 --> 12:24.625
(Will)
'We're only
interested in one pair.'

12:24.709 --> 12:26.375
Said "Are You High" on them.

12:26.458 --> 12:29.500
That narrows it
to, like, a hundred.

12:29.583 --> 12:32.583
So you just
let it go,
then?

12:32.667 --> 12:34.500
Ruby dissing you
in front of all your pals?

12:34.583 --> 12:35.834
I didn't just let it go.

12:35.917 --> 12:37.291
But I sure as hell
I didn't kill nobody.

12:37.375 --> 12:38.333
What did you do?

12:38.417 --> 12:40.000
I got some practice in.

12:40.083 --> 12:42.667
Wasn't my finest work, but..

12:46.834 --> 12:49.500
(female #2)
'Principal's office.'

12:49.583 --> 12:51.041
What the hell happened?

12:51.125 --> 12:53.834
Brent, mom and dad
are here, alright?

12:54.917 --> 12:57.166
We're going to take you home.

12:57.250 --> 12:58.667
So you can see Sammy.

13:01.500 --> 13:02.625
He misses you.

13:02.709 --> 13:04.208
Sammy's a fish.

13:04.291 --> 13:07.291
He doesn't miss people.

13:07.375 --> 13:10.667
- Did you do this?
- Do what?

13:10.750 --> 13:13.959
I'm here for a student
council meeting, dawg.

13:14.041 --> 13:15.041
Mr. and Mrs. Harris

13:15.125 --> 13:17.083
- I am so sorry.
- Sorry?

13:17.166 --> 13:19.291
You promised you'd have
someone looking out for Brent.

13:19.375 --> 13:20.542
The state mandates--

13:20.625 --> 13:21.583
(female #3)
'The state budgets one'

13:21.667 --> 13:22.667
'special needs counselor for'

13:22.750 --> 13:23.917
'the entire ninth grade.'

13:24.000 --> 13:25.041
(Lisa)
'I can't tell you how sick
to'

13:25.125 --> 13:26.417
'death we are of your excuses.'

13:26.500 --> 13:27.542
(female #3)
'If you have
a problem with the way'

13:27.625 --> 13:28.667
'the special needs program is--'

13:28.750 --> 13:29.834
Don't you dare tell us

13:29.917 --> 13:31.000
to write another letter or call

13:31.083 --> 13:32.083
the school board
because we've already

13:32.166 --> 13:33.250
done that a dozen times!

13:33.333 --> 13:35.875
It's okay. It's over.

13:35.959 --> 13:39.000
We are officially withdrawing
Brent from your school.

13:39.083 --> 13:41.208
Well, that is your prerogative.

13:41.291 --> 13:42.375
You're glad, aren't you?

13:42.458 --> 13:43.542
I think Brent might be happier

13:43.625 --> 13:45.542
'in another school, yes.'

13:45.625 --> 13:47.375
'But I know the alternatives
are expensive.'

13:47.458 --> 13:49.792
Yeah, they are expensive.

13:51.208 --> 13:52.333
Too expensive.

13:52.417 --> 13:53.709
There's no turning back now.

13:58.250 --> 13:59.834
Come on, Brent.

14:03.917 --> 14:05.834
It's time for Plan B.

14:13.166 --> 14:14.417
(Kat)
'"Plan B?"'

14:14.500 --> 14:16.583
Any idea what
that could've meant?

14:16.667 --> 14:20.583
Hey, I'm the guy who needed to
cheat off the dummy, remember?

14:27.875 --> 14:31.041
No, I don't want that.

14:31.125 --> 14:33.250
I've been reading
up on autism.

14:33.333 --> 14:34.959
- Yeah?
- Well, they can't lie.

14:35.041 --> 14:37.458
- Incapable of it.
- No kidding.

14:37.542 --> 14:39.291
Well, same with humor.
They don't get it.

14:39.375 --> 14:42.041
You say something like,
"Guy was high as a kite."

14:42.125 --> 14:45.125
And they're like, "How could
a guy be high as a kite?

14:45.208 --> 14:47.083
He weighs too much."

14:47.166 --> 14:49.125
Riveting.

14:54.166 --> 14:56.291
Hello, Brent.

14:56.375 --> 14:58.625
Remember me?
Detective
Valens.

14:58.709 --> 14:59.959
9-1-3-6.

15:01.125 --> 15:02.333
That's my badge number.

15:02.417 --> 15:03.917
Neat trick.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.959
I...it's all about triggers.

15:06.041 --> 15:07.667
See I say, "Detective Valens."

15:07.750 --> 15:08.792
9-1-3-6.

15:08.875 --> 15:10.208
And he coughs up. I get it.

15:10.291 --> 15:12.083
Listen, kid, I want
to ask you some questions.

15:12.166 --> 15:14.291
Okay?

15:14.375 --> 15:15.625
'Hey.'

15:15.709 --> 15:17.000
Vera.

15:21.458 --> 15:23.166
You remember when your parents

15:23.250 --> 15:25.667
pulled you out of Ritter
Union High School, Brent?

15:25.750 --> 15:27.458
You were covered
in yellow spray paint.

15:27.542 --> 15:28.959
You don't like
yellow,
do you, Brent?

15:29.041 --> 15:30.917
Three red flakes,
two blue, one green.

15:31.000 --> 15:34.667
- No yellow.
- Not my favorite color
either.

15:34.750 --> 15:36.917
Well, now we got that settled.

15:42.834 --> 15:46.458
As your parents were
leaving
the principal's office

15:46.542 --> 15:50.166
your dad said,
"It's time for Plan
B."

15:50.250 --> 15:51.583
Save Sammy.

15:54.250 --> 15:57.000
Plan B meant "Save Sammy?"

15:57.083 --> 15:58.375
Plan B. Save Sammy.

16:00.542 --> 16:03.375
Who the hell is Sammy?

16:03.458 --> 16:05.583
- Plan B.
- Save Sammy.

16:34.125 --> 16:35.625
(Nick)
'So Sammy's a fish?'

16:35.709 --> 16:37.709
Sammy's fighting fish.
Betta splendens.

16:37.792 --> 16:40.208
Indigenous to Thailand.
Males live alone.

16:40.291 --> 16:42.458
Who saved Sammy, Brent?

16:42.542 --> 16:44.083
Doug saved Sammy.

16:44.166 --> 16:45.333
Doug, your sister's boyfriend?

16:45.417 --> 16:46.583
Doug says hi.

16:48.583 --> 16:50.166
Is that a yes?

16:52.333 --> 16:54.583
You did good, Brent.

16:54.667 --> 16:55.959
Real..

16:57.917 --> 16:59.000
...good.

17:21.375 --> 17:23.583
(John)
'Had a talk with Brent,
Doug.'

17:23.667 --> 17:25.333
Brent's talkin'?

17:25.417 --> 17:27.041
Well, that's great.

17:27.125 --> 17:29.125
- Maybe not so great for you.
- Why's that?

17:29.208 --> 17:31.208
He put you at the scene
of his parents' murders.

17:31.291 --> 17:33.208
- No way. That-that can't be.
- Says you.

17:33.291 --> 17:34.667
Look, I was at
the batting
cages.

17:34.750 --> 17:36.583
I didn't clock out
till nine. You can
check.

17:36.667 --> 17:39.125
- We will.
- Besides, I loved that kid.

17:39.208 --> 17:40.792
His whole
family,
not just Ruby.

17:40.875 --> 17:42.375
Are you still in
contact with her?

17:42.458 --> 17:45.000
No. After her parents
died, she froze me
out.

17:45.083 --> 17:46.250
Why's that?

17:46.333 --> 17:47.333
I hung out with the Harrises

17:47.417 --> 17:48.542
a lot on account of my

17:48.625 --> 17:50.458
family being
a total disaster
area.

17:50.542 --> 17:53.208
So you reminded Ruby
too much of the past?

17:53.291 --> 17:54.542
That's what I like
to think, anyway.

17:54.625 --> 17:56.792
Oh, better than
the alternative.

17:56.875 --> 17:58.125
That she stopped loving me?

17:58.208 --> 18:00.125
Yeah.

18:00.208 --> 18:01.542
Yeah.

18:01.625 --> 18:04.250
Brent was real
specific, Doug.

18:06.083 --> 18:09.000
- Said you saved Sammy.
- Saved Sammy?

18:09.083 --> 18:12.500
Said you picked his cup
off the floor of the car

18:12.583 --> 18:15.125
'the night of the murder.'

18:15.208 --> 18:17.208
Yeah. I know, I know
what he's talking
about.

18:17.291 --> 18:18.166
Oh, yeah?

18:18.250 --> 18:20.000
You see, autistics like Brent

18:20.083 --> 18:21.375
they can't keep time straight.

18:21.458 --> 18:22.375
You made a study?

18:22.458 --> 18:24.500
No. Ruby told me.

18:24.583 --> 18:26.083
You see, it's like
Brent can't keep
things

18:26.166 --> 18:27.500
in sequence, you know?

18:27.583 --> 18:29.000
Like, he talks
about yesterday

18:29.083 --> 18:31.000
or a year ago like it
happened at the same
time.

18:31.083 --> 18:33.333
What's that got to do with Brent
placing you at the crime scene?

18:33.417 --> 18:35.125
Everything.

18:35.208 --> 18:36.500
'Cause I did
save Sammy.

18:36.583 --> 18:38.750
Just not the night
he was talking
about.

18:50.458 --> 18:51.959
(Brent)
'No, no, no.'

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
No. No, no.

18:54.083 --> 18:55.417
Go back to your room, Brent.

18:55.500 --> 18:56.959
No, no, no.

18:57.041 --> 18:58.500
No, Sammy doesn't
like other fish.

18:58.583 --> 18:59.625
Brent, calm down.

18:59.709 --> 19:00.709
No, this is Sammy's house.

19:00.792 --> 19:01.709
You're right, Brent.

19:01.792 --> 19:02.750
This is Sammy's house.

19:02.834 --> 19:03.875
And no one's gonna hurt him.

19:03.959 --> 19:05.417
He's going to start
stimming for sure.

19:05.500 --> 19:07.583
No, no. No, the fish
store is their house.

19:07.667 --> 19:09.875
Brent, remember how we
talked about transitions?

19:09.959 --> 19:11.166
Well, this is one of them.

19:11.250 --> 19:12.458
You're just gonna
have to get used to

19:12.542 --> 19:14.041
these fish being here.

19:16.875 --> 19:19.291
No, no, no.

19:20.792 --> 19:22.208
No, no, no.

19:26.375 --> 19:28.333
Save Sammy! Save Sammy. Save..

19:28.417 --> 19:30.542
It's okay, Brent. See?

19:30.625 --> 19:32.208
'It's okay, Brent, look.'

19:34.583 --> 19:36.792
'See, look, I saved Sammy.'

19:36.875 --> 19:37.834
He's fine.

19:39.000 --> 19:40.625
Doug saved Sammy.

19:40.709 --> 19:42.834
Yeah, he did.

19:43.875 --> 19:45.250
You know what, Brent?

19:45.333 --> 19:47.083
I bet Sammy would like
to look at the other
fish.

19:47.166 --> 19:48.500
Betta splendens.
Males live alone.

19:48.583 --> 19:51.125
No. Just-just-just
look, not go near
them.

19:51.208 --> 19:52.542
'Just look, okay?'

20:05.166 --> 20:07.709
See, Brent. He likes it.

20:07.792 --> 20:09.083
I can tell.

20:24.375 --> 20:26.250
Oh, what were the Harrises doing

20:26.333 --> 20:28.458
with all those fish
in the basement?

20:28.542 --> 20:30.333
I promised I
wouldn't say.

20:30.417 --> 20:31.959
When did this happen, Doug?

20:32.041 --> 20:33.291
Uh..

20:33.375 --> 20:36.792
This was before
the fire, wasn't it?

20:36.875 --> 20:38.583
Yeah.

20:38.667 --> 20:40.208
They didn't want
to kill their own
fish.

20:40.291 --> 20:42.792
- So they brought them home.
- That's what Plan B was.

20:42.875 --> 20:45.000
Burnin' down their own store.

21:08.667 --> 21:10.625
So they're finally
kicking
you out of here, huh?

21:10.709 --> 21:13.667
I'm driving the nurses
to distraction.

21:13.750 --> 21:16.125
They...keep coming in
and giving me sponge baths.

21:19.500 --> 21:21.709
It's nice your guy
let you come visit.

21:22.625 --> 21:25.333
I'm here to say goodbye, Ray.

21:25.417 --> 21:27.000
A goodbye, goodbye like?

21:27.083 --> 21:29.250
sayonara? Adios?

21:29.333 --> 21:32.000
- This isn't a joke.
- Who's laughing?

21:39.542 --> 21:41.750
Um..

21:41.834 --> 21:43.959
I'm leavin'
in the morning.

21:44.917 --> 21:46.583
Back to Jersey?

21:52.792 --> 21:54.041
Nah.

21:57.959 --> 21:59.834
I'm thinking maybe California.

21:59.917 --> 22:01.583
California.

22:03.667 --> 22:05.000
Wow.

22:05.083 --> 22:06.333
Yeah.

22:07.917 --> 22:10.792
You know this guy..

22:10.875 --> 22:13.000
...he's just a rookie.

22:14.500 --> 22:15.875
We go way back, Lil.

22:15.959 --> 22:18.500
- I know.
- So come with me?

22:18.583 --> 22:19.959
I-I got to stop
runnin' sometime.

22:20.041 --> 22:21.291
I ain't running
from anything.

22:21.375 --> 22:22.834
I meant me.

22:24.333 --> 22:26.125
Then stay.

22:28.417 --> 22:29.542
Bye.

22:33.792 --> 22:34.750
Bye.

22:43.500 --> 22:44.583
Bye.

22:56.250 --> 22:58.542
Your brother may not
be able to lie, Ruby.

22:58.625 --> 23:01.125
But you don't seem to
have any problem with it.

23:01.208 --> 23:03.792
- What are you talking about?
- The fish store.

23:03.875 --> 23:05.375
(Kat)
'Your parents burning it
down.'

23:05.458 --> 23:09.166
My parents were the best,
so don't you dare.

23:09.250 --> 23:10.792
You got a temper, Ruby?

23:10.875 --> 23:12.625
When it comes to
people talking trash

23:12.709 --> 23:15.542
about my family, yeah, I do.

23:15.625 --> 23:17.041
Ever occur to
you that arson

23:17.125 --> 23:18.417
might've had something
to do with their
murder?

23:18.500 --> 23:19.959
My parents did
what they had to
do.

23:20.041 --> 23:21.208
They had to burn
down their own store?

23:21.291 --> 23:23.792
- They were desperate.
- Why?

23:23.875 --> 23:26.166
'Cause a couple of months before
they yanked Brent out of school

23:26.250 --> 23:29.125
this jerk offered them
something they couldn't
resist.

23:29.208 --> 23:30.291
What?

23:30.375 --> 23:31.625
Hope.

23:32.875 --> 23:35.166
On the autism spectrum
disorder, Mr. Harvey

23:35.250 --> 23:36.625
Brent's very
high functioning.

23:36.709 --> 23:37.750
He knows everything there is

23:37.834 --> 23:39.417
to know about tropical fish.

23:39.500 --> 23:42.083
And he's excellent at
math. Aren't you, Brent?

23:42.166 --> 23:44.667
- I'm in Algebra 1A.
- Well, that's terrific.

23:44.750 --> 23:46.625
But here at North Bend

23:46.709 --> 23:49.333
our real focus is on
emotional
and social development.

23:49.417 --> 23:52.166
Oh, that's great. That's
just what we're looking for.

23:53.500 --> 23:55.667
Here's an example of
what I'm talking about.

23:55.750 --> 23:57.041
'That's Jason.'

23:58.417 --> 23:59.625
'When he came to North Bend'

23:59.709 --> 24:00.792
'he wouldn't let
anyone near him.'

24:00.875 --> 24:03.000
'Now look at him.'

24:03.083 --> 24:05.250
That's amazing.

24:05.333 --> 24:08.000
Has Brent ever hugged you?
Or held your hand?

24:08.083 --> 24:11.000
- 'Touched your face?'
- No.

24:11.083 --> 24:13.834
Well, that's the hope
we hold out for parents

24:13.917 --> 24:16.000
here at North Bend.

24:18.208 --> 24:20.208
But there is one obstacle.

24:20.291 --> 24:22.250
I'm afraid we
have a waiting list.

24:22.333 --> 24:24.875
- How long?
- We're not even taking names.

24:27.583 --> 24:29.875
There is
an alternative, however.

24:29.959 --> 24:33.208
It's, uh...
an incentive
program.

24:33.291 --> 24:34.875
'One where I see to it that'

24:34.959 --> 24:37.959
'Brent's name goes to
the top of the waiting
list.'

24:38.041 --> 24:39.000
(Steve)
'You see to it?'

24:39.083 --> 24:41.834
Yes. For an incentive.

24:45.125 --> 24:46.125
How much?

24:46.208 --> 24:48.959
Twenty grand. In cash.

24:54.500 --> 24:57.000
So your parents burned their
own store to pay the bribe?

24:57.083 --> 24:59.542
Except the
insurance
company boned us.

24:59.625 --> 25:02.542
Said the store had faulty
wiring. Never paid the
claim.

25:02.625 --> 25:04.250
Your mom and dad
must've been
devastated.

25:04.333 --> 25:07.208
They were. They lost
everything
trying to pay off that pimp.

25:07.291 --> 25:10.542
But they were determined, right?

25:10.625 --> 25:11.792
Desperate.

25:11.875 --> 25:13.333
Would've done anything.

25:14.625 --> 25:17.125
So what if they
went back to him?

25:17.208 --> 25:18.875
'Turned the tables.'

25:18.959 --> 25:20.750
Used his bribe against him.

25:23.959 --> 25:25.583
Got to hand it
to you, Harvey.

25:25.667 --> 25:27.208
Heck of a scheme.

25:28.625 --> 25:31.375
Extorting desperate parents.

25:31.458 --> 25:32.750
That's offensive.

25:32.834 --> 25:34.542
You make $42,000 a year

25:34.625 --> 25:37.291
and live in an $800,000
waterfront condo.

25:37.375 --> 25:40.250
I have dedicated my life
to this school, to these
kids.

25:40.333 --> 25:43.291
Doesn't explain the
discrepancy
in your finances.

25:43.375 --> 25:46.583
Do I receive gifts every now
and then from grateful
parents?

25:46.667 --> 25:47.959
Yes. Guilty.

25:48.041 --> 25:50.542
And what about people who
can't afford to give you
gifts?

25:50.625 --> 25:52.917
People like the Harrises.

25:53.000 --> 25:54.208
The Harrises?

25:54.291 --> 25:55.959
Yeah, they came to you,
threatened to expose

25:56.041 --> 25:57.333
your little incentive program.

25:57.417 --> 26:00.458
- Oh, they never threatened
me.
- Sure about that?

26:00.542 --> 26:02.875
Yeah, they begged me
to let their kid in.

26:02.959 --> 26:05.166
- And you said no.
- I gave them my best advice.

26:05.250 --> 26:07.625
- Gratis.
- Which was?

26:07.709 --> 26:10.000
There's a school in
Vermont for kids with
autism.

26:10.083 --> 26:11.083
Doesn't charge tuition.

26:11.166 --> 26:12.291
- Vermont?
- Yeah.

26:12.375 --> 26:13.583
I even made some
phone calls for
'em.

26:13.667 --> 26:14.792
Made sure
their
kid could get
in.

26:14.875 --> 26:16.125
- And did he?
- Yes.

26:16.208 --> 26:17.875
They were going
to move there.

26:17.959 --> 26:19.625
The whole family?

26:21.041 --> 26:23.333
I'm all about the kids.

26:23.417 --> 26:26.166
Yeah. You're a real champ.

26:39.208 --> 26:40.542
(Lilly)
'Joseph.'

26:47.125 --> 26:49.500
I found a place for
Ruby at a halfway
house.

26:49.583 --> 26:52.208
She can live there
with Brent if she
wants.

26:52.291 --> 26:53.709
I've been calling you.

26:53.792 --> 26:55.542
I went by your
apartment
last night 'cause I
thought

26:55.625 --> 26:57.208
we were going to talk, but..

26:57.291 --> 26:59.458
...you never showed up.

26:59.542 --> 27:01.500
I was at the hospital.

27:01.583 --> 27:03.125
With him.

27:05.750 --> 27:07.250
Saying goodbye.

27:08.625 --> 27:10.041
And after..

27:10.125 --> 27:11.959
...I walked all night.

27:13.208 --> 27:15.250
And now I'm here.

27:15.792 --> 27:17.750
With you.

27:17.834 --> 27:20.208
Sounds like it was
a tough decision.

27:20.291 --> 27:21.709
It was.

27:23.917 --> 27:26.959
Well, it's just
that, Ray knows me.

27:27.041 --> 27:28.375
Everything about me.

27:28.458 --> 27:30.291
And maybe if you let me
in, I'll leave you too?

27:30.375 --> 27:31.333
Ray never left me.

27:31.417 --> 27:33.500
No. He's just never around.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.291
I mean, maybe that's
what you really want.

27:38.375 --> 27:41.291
No. I want to be with you.

27:41.375 --> 27:44.000
What, for like a
week,
a month, then what?

27:47.792 --> 27:49.917
Can't we try?

27:52.000 --> 27:54.041
I left your key on the table.

27:55.542 --> 27:57.500
Don't leave, Joseph.

27:57.583 --> 27:58.917
Please.

27:59.000 --> 28:01.417
Look, I'm not your
consolation prize.

28:09.834 --> 28:11.917
I don't want to be alone.

28:15.709 --> 28:16.834
Maybe you do.

28:36.792 --> 28:39.458
Why not go to the normal
sibling, ask about
Vermont?

28:39.542 --> 28:41.000
'Cause the sister lies.

28:41.083 --> 28:42.291
And your boy
Brent can't?

28:42.375 --> 28:43.291
That's right.

28:43.375 --> 28:47.208
- Now take off your tie.
- What?

28:47.291 --> 28:49.500
Your tie, it's yellow.
Brent hates yellow.

28:51.375 --> 28:53.166
Forget it.

28:53.250 --> 28:54.667
No way.

29:03.417 --> 29:06.750
Uh, it's
Detective Valens,
Brent.

29:06.834 --> 29:08.375
9-1-3-6.

29:08.458 --> 29:10.500
Uh, that's right.

29:13.583 --> 29:16.792
Your parents cared
a lot about you,
Brent.

29:16.875 --> 29:18.166
You know that?

29:18.250 --> 29:19.583
Mom and dad.

29:19.667 --> 29:22.333
They cared so much they
were planning on moving

29:22.417 --> 29:24.750
so that you could go
to a better school.

29:26.250 --> 29:28.166
A school in Vermont.

29:28.250 --> 29:31.834
3-4-5-6-5-2-S-W-3-8.

29:31.917 --> 29:33.709
What do those numbers have
to do with Vermont, Brent?

29:33.792 --> 29:37.458
Vermont.
3-4-5-6-5-2-S-W-3-8.

29:37.542 --> 29:40.458
Brent, where did
you
see those numbers?

29:46.834 --> 29:49.291
Okay. Okay.

29:51.709 --> 29:54.709
(Steve)
'Okay, okay. Forget Vermont.'

30:04.792 --> 30:06.667
I know what that number
is, at least the last part.

30:06.750 --> 30:09.291
- What?
- 'S-W-3-8?'

30:09.375 --> 30:12.250
Smith and Wesson .38.

30:12.333 --> 30:14.917
So the first part must
be the serial number.

30:15.000 --> 30:17.583
Kid, you just gave us the gun.

30:20.125 --> 30:22.041
(Nick)
'It's all about triggers,
boss.'

30:22.125 --> 30:23.458
- Triggers?
- Yeah.

30:23.542 --> 30:25.291
Say the right word,
you get the right answer.

30:25.375 --> 30:26.542
So you're clueing into Brent?

30:26.625 --> 30:27.875
I don't want
to take all the credit.

30:27.959 --> 30:30.542
I mean...Scotty was there.

30:30.625 --> 30:31.750
I got it.

30:31.834 --> 30:33.041
The serial number.

30:33.125 --> 30:35.041
Who's the gun
registered to?

30:37.041 --> 30:38.333
Steve Harris.

30:39.625 --> 30:42.500
Brent's dad?

30:42.583 --> 30:44.834
Parents were killed
with their own gun.

30:52.834 --> 30:56.041
Your parents were killed
with their own gun, Ruby.

30:56.125 --> 30:57.417
I don't know what
you're talking about.

30:57.500 --> 30:59.750
A gun you had access to.

30:59.834 --> 31:02.291
[scoffs]
You think I killed
my own parents?

31:02.375 --> 31:04.750
You didn't want
to move to Vermont.

31:04.834 --> 31:07.291
[scoffs]
Vermont.

31:07.375 --> 31:08.291
Yeah.

31:08.375 --> 31:09.834
We know about that, Ruby.

31:09.917 --> 31:11.959
Moving away from Doug.

31:12.041 --> 31:14.250
(Lilly)
'Your amazing boyfriend.'

31:14.333 --> 31:16.542
(Will)
'"Forget Vermont,"
your parents said'

31:16.625 --> 31:20.959
right before they were shot.
That's why they were killed.

31:21.041 --> 31:26.583
None of us wanted to move. But
they said we had to, for Brent.

31:26.667 --> 31:28.792
It was always about
Brent, wasn't it?

31:28.875 --> 31:30.291
(Will)
'Your cross to bear.'

31:30.375 --> 31:31.834
I understood.

31:31.917 --> 31:36.417
You know, I have a sister,
Ruby. A real screw up.

31:36.500 --> 31:39.333
And no matter how perfect I was

31:39.417 --> 31:41.333
my mom was all about her.

31:41.417 --> 31:44.125
'It was like I
didn't even exist.'

31:44.208 --> 31:45.291
That's not how it was with us.

31:45.375 --> 31:46.709
Oh, yeah?

31:46.792 --> 31:48.333
'You didn't bail
Brent out of trouble'

31:48.417 --> 31:49.959
all the time?

31:50.041 --> 31:52.917
You didn't hate them
for ignoring you.

31:53.000 --> 31:55.959
- For a freak?
- Don't call him that.

31:56.041 --> 31:58.166
He didn't mean to do it.

31:59.750 --> 32:01.834
Do what?

32:01.917 --> 32:04.667
What did Brent do, Ruby?

32:04.750 --> 32:05.834
That night..

32:05.917 --> 32:08.834
The night your
parents were killed?

32:08.917 --> 32:10.500
...Brent came home..

33:02.709 --> 33:04.750
I buried his clothes

33:04.834 --> 33:07.166
and the gun in the backyard.

33:13.625 --> 33:15.375
Okay, Ruby.

33:17.000 --> 33:20.083
I won't be able to take
care of Brent now, will I?

33:24.125 --> 33:25.500
No.

33:44.125 --> 33:45.875
It's me, Brent,
Detective Valens.

33:45.959 --> 33:47.375
9-1-3-6.

33:47.458 --> 33:49.417
That's right.

33:51.875 --> 33:54.375
We talked to your sister, Ruby.

33:54.458 --> 33:56.291
She told us what happened.

33:58.000 --> 33:59.417
'You were in the car
with your parents'

33:59.500 --> 34:01.250
'when they were murdered.'

34:01.333 --> 34:03.250
0-6-5-7-3-9.1.

34:03.333 --> 34:05.875
'That's right, Brent.
That was the odometer number.'

34:08.417 --> 34:10.875
- Then you saw those shoes.
- "Are You High."

34:10.959 --> 34:13.959
And you didn't want to
move
'cause you don't like
change.

34:14.041 --> 34:16.959
That's why your dad said,
"Okay, okay, forget
Vermont."

34:17.041 --> 34:20.000
3-4-5-6-5-2-S-W-3-8.

34:21.542 --> 34:24.583
The serial number
of the gun.

34:24.667 --> 34:26.875
The gun that you fired.

34:29.458 --> 34:31.542
The gun you fired, Brent!

34:34.583 --> 34:37.250
The gun your sister
said you were
holding.

34:37.333 --> 34:40.166
2-1-5-5-5-5-0-1-9-6.

34:42.166 --> 34:44.125
2-1-5..

34:44.208 --> 34:45.500
That's a Philly
area code,
Brent.

34:45.583 --> 34:47.375
That's a phone number.

34:49.333 --> 34:52.041
What does that number have
to do with you holding the
gun?

34:52.125 --> 34:53.250
2-1-5-5-5-5--

34:53.333 --> 34:55.583
Brent, whose phone
number is that?

34:57.291 --> 34:59.125
Sammy's house.

35:13.333 --> 35:16.959
The killer got a call from
someone in your house,
Brent?

35:18.458 --> 35:19.583
Sammy's house.

35:19.667 --> 35:21.709
Your house.

35:25.500 --> 35:26.917
My house.

35:37.417 --> 35:39.041
Brent..

35:40.458 --> 35:41.542
Detective Valens..

35:41.625 --> 35:43.875
9-1-3-6.

35:48.000 --> 35:50.250
...is proud of you.

35:50.333 --> 35:51.709
Okay.

35:54.250 --> 35:55.458
Okay.

36:21.041 --> 36:22.250
Hey, detectives. How you doing?

36:22.333 --> 36:24.208
Oh, Brent's been
talking again, Doug.

36:24.291 --> 36:25.375
Well, that's good, right?

36:25.458 --> 36:26.542
Ruby made a phone call

36:26.625 --> 36:27.834
from her house
the night of the murder.

36:27.917 --> 36:31.125
- At 6:20. To your cell.
- Don't lie.

36:31.208 --> 36:32.208
'Cause we got
the phone records.

36:32.291 --> 36:33.375
Yeah, and your point?

36:33.458 --> 36:34.500
Brent saw his home number

36:34.583 --> 36:36.375
flash on the killer's phone.

36:36.458 --> 36:37.583
Your phone.

36:37.667 --> 36:38.667
Whoa, wait, back up.

36:38.750 --> 36:40.041
Uh, Brent saw?

36:40.125 --> 36:42.959
That's right. Brent.
And Brent doesn't lie.

36:43.041 --> 36:45.166
And you might have clocked
out of work at nine, Doug

36:45.250 --> 36:47.000
but nobody remembers
you being around

36:47.083 --> 36:48.500
'between six and seven.'

36:48.583 --> 36:50.917
And we know you helped
the Harrises move their stuff

36:51.041 --> 36:53.000
out of their store.

36:53.083 --> 36:55.250
The gun they kept
there included.

36:57.500 --> 36:59.667
You said you loved
the Harrises, Doug.

37:01.500 --> 37:02.917
I did.

37:04.333 --> 37:07.333
They were like
the family I never
had.

37:07.417 --> 37:09.500
But they were
going to move away.

37:09.583 --> 37:11.291
(Scotty)
'And you were
going to lose Ruby'

37:11.375 --> 37:13.750
'and the family that
was better than your own.'

37:18.834 --> 37:21.166
[crying]
See, you don't get
it.

37:21.250 --> 37:22.583
Get what?

37:22.667 --> 37:25.291
That Brent's
the lucky
one.

37:25.375 --> 37:27.709
Not being able
to feel
anything.

37:27.792 --> 37:29.875
'Cause you felt too much?

37:31.333 --> 37:34.291
Look, I loved Ruby more than
anyone's ever loved anybody.

37:37.542 --> 37:39.000
And you couldn't
let a love like that

37:39.083 --> 37:41.625
just...disappear on you.

37:44.542 --> 37:47.166
The thought of her
not being with me..

37:47.250 --> 37:49.500
...moving away forever..

37:51.750 --> 37:53.834
Not a possibility.

37:55.500 --> 37:57.291
So you had to stop 'em.

37:57.375 --> 37:59.750
I didn't want to, I swear.

38:01.458 --> 38:03.875
But it was like my heart..

38:04.917 --> 38:06.875
It was like..

38:10.583 --> 38:11.834
Lovesick.

38:29.959 --> 38:32.709
[gasps]
Oh! What are you doing
out here in the rain?

38:32.792 --> 38:35.208
You're soaked. Hop in.
Come on, it's take-out
Tuesday.

38:35.291 --> 38:37.083
I know.

38:39.458 --> 38:41.125
- I can't let you do it.
- 'Do what?'

38:41.208 --> 38:43.458
- 'Take her away from me.'
- 'Ruby?'

38:43.542 --> 38:45.875
(Doug)
'She's my air. I cannot
breathe without her.'

38:45.959 --> 38:47.291
I will die, I swear.

38:47.375 --> 38:49.875
- What are you doing?
- You can't take her. I mean
it.

38:49.959 --> 38:52.625
Okay, okay. Forget Vermont.

38:52.709 --> 38:56.166
(Doug)
'You say that now, but I know
you will do anything for
Brent.'

38:56.250 --> 38:57.458
No, no!

38:58.166 --> 38:59.458
I'm sorry.

38:59.542 --> 39:01.750
I'm so sorry.
