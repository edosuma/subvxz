00:14.348 --> 00:16.340
Breaking news just coming in.

00:16.350 --> 00:19.934
A maximum security prison's
trying to maintain a riot

00:19.937 --> 00:22.224
involving 600 inmates today.

00:22.231 --> 00:25.645
A prisoner, James Rowan,
is currently at large.

00:25.651 --> 00:27.813
Do not approach this man, believed to be

00:27.819 --> 00:29.776
armed and extremely dangerous.

00:55.347 --> 00:58.306
My name is
Major General Charles Smith,

00:59.142 --> 01:00.758
and this recording serves to document,

01:03.188 --> 01:04.849
the evolution of the viral outbreak.

01:11.280 --> 01:16.275
War used to be about borders,
it used to be about religion.

01:16.827 --> 01:21.822
Now it's about survival, the
extinction of the human race.

01:33.510 --> 01:35.251
My old Staff Sergeant used to say

01:35.262 --> 01:39.552
that every generation is
defined by the wars it fights.

01:41.143 --> 01:42.930
For him it was World War Il,

01:44.271 --> 01:46.604
for my generation, the Gulf War,

01:46.607 --> 01:49.896
then the War on Terror, or so we thought.

01:53.864 --> 01:55.651
History changed that day.

01:57.159 --> 01:59.321
Now we face a new enemy,

02:01.163 --> 02:05.407
one without compassion, a
soul, or even a heartbeat.

02:23.685 --> 02:25.642
General Smith, attention!

02:33.153 --> 02:35.065
Three weeks ago a riot broke out

02:35.072 --> 02:37.314
at Wentworth Prison in London.

02:37.324 --> 02:41.113
James Rowan, the first identified carrier

02:41.119 --> 02:42.119
of the virus.

02:47.042 --> 02:48.829
He had help with his escape.

02:50.587 --> 02:54.957
The first was this man,
known as Ivan Gavric,

02:54.966 --> 02:57.959
Rowan's cellmate and best friend inside.

02:59.137 --> 03:01.470
Ivan's whereabouts are
unknown since the breakout.

03:02.432 --> 03:05.175
But we believe he is
within the quarantine zone

03:06.269 --> 03:10.104
- along with many of his men.
- Now go, go ahead.

03:10.107 --> 03:13.316
His hostage, Jennifer Stanton,

03:13.318 --> 03:15.480
was the second confirmed carrier.

03:19.533 --> 03:21.024
Get out.

03:22.369 --> 03:23.905
Armed police, drop your weapon!

03:23.912 --> 03:25.403
The virus was transmitted

03:25.414 --> 03:26.700
when she bit Rowan.

03:29.668 --> 03:32.285
As you all know, she
was your captain's wife,

03:33.588 --> 03:35.420
and we're sorry for your loss.

03:39.636 --> 03:41.878
The virus is currently contained

03:41.888 --> 03:44.255
in this designated quarantine zone.

03:44.266 --> 03:46.258
The fortified borders are the only things

03:46.268 --> 03:49.011
keeping the infected from getting to us.

03:49.855 --> 03:52.438
In 72 hours, the quarantine zone

03:52.441 --> 03:54.273
will be completely annihilated.

03:55.736 --> 03:58.604
Once infected, the virus attacks the brain

03:58.613 --> 04:00.730
and central nervous system.

04:00.741 --> 04:05.111
Initial symptoms include
fever, vomiting, coughing,

04:05.120 --> 04:09.490
psychotic behavior, and
extreme violent aggression.

04:11.084 --> 04:13.497
The incubation period
can vary from 30 minutes

04:13.503 --> 04:15.916
to six hours, depending on the strength

04:15.922 --> 04:17.333
of the host's immune system.

04:18.341 --> 04:22.051
The virus is a bloodborne
pathogen, not airborne.

04:22.053 --> 04:25.091
This is Dr. Julian Raynes, a scientist

04:25.098 --> 04:27.465
and an expert in genetic manipulation.

04:27.476 --> 04:28.887
We believe there is a direct link

04:28.894 --> 04:32.012
between his experiments and the outbreak.

04:32.022 --> 04:34.605
If he is responsible,
he may be the only hope

04:34.608 --> 04:35.769
of finding a cure.

04:36.902 --> 04:40.111
Our intel has placed him
at these four locations

04:40.113 --> 04:41.479
within the quarantine zone.

04:42.657 --> 04:44.148
You have 72 hours.

04:46.119 --> 04:47.109
May God be with you.

05:10.143 --> 05:11.143
How far are we?

05:13.104 --> 05:15.596
Less than a mile out
sir, 10 minutes max.

05:17.442 --> 05:19.308
Listen up everyone.

05:19.319 --> 05:20.730
We hit the ground in 10.

05:21.655 --> 05:25.274
This is about extraction and nothing else.

05:26.326 --> 05:29.740
We keep our cool, we keep it sharp

05:29.746 --> 05:34.036
and we must remain focused at all times.

05:34.042 --> 05:37.080
Rodrigo, are you listening?

05:37.087 --> 05:38.828
Roger that sun ray.

05:38.839 --> 05:40.171
No fun of any kind.

06:05.365 --> 06:07.527
Let's head to
the first location point.

06:07.534 --> 06:09.867
Bernstein, over to you.

06:09.870 --> 06:10.781
Let's go.

06:52.287 --> 06:55.871
Jacob, Lau, we go left.

06:57.375 --> 07:01.335
Kira, Perez, eyes on high points.

07:16.186 --> 07:18.394
Everyone stay on station, let's move.

07:56.977 --> 07:58.218
Poor bastard.

08:17.580 --> 08:20.573
Bernstein, what's status?

08:23.878 --> 08:24.789
Raynes' last known location

08:24.796 --> 08:26.207
should be up on our left.

08:26.214 --> 08:29.378
Pull back, pull back, now, now, now.

08:43.356 --> 08:45.564
It's as if the
infected still have memories

08:45.567 --> 08:48.230
or fragments of the
lives they used to lead.

08:49.654 --> 08:52.988
You'll be entering an
extremely hostile environment.

08:55.535 --> 08:58.903
All necessary force is authorized.

08:58.913 --> 09:00.404
Captain, orders.

09:03.752 --> 09:04.752
Orders.

09:16.556 --> 09:17.967
It's an ambush!

09:24.189 --> 09:25.189
Contact Red!

09:27.192 --> 09:28.433
Fire at will.

10:16.366 --> 10:18.358
Rodrigo, 9:00!

10:42.851 --> 10:44.592
Bernstein, they're on you!

10:49.274 --> 10:50.274
Reeves!

11:06.666 --> 11:08.828
Eyes and that away,
they're coming in hard!

11:12.046 --> 11:13.537
We're being overrun,

11:13.548 --> 11:15.631
there's too many of them.

11:16.968 --> 11:17.968
Fall back!

11:23.141 --> 11:23.972
Fall back!

11:23.975 --> 11:25.432
Get the fuck back!

11:25.435 --> 11:26.471
Let's head for that building!

11:26.477 --> 11:28.639
let's move people, let's go!

11:31.149 --> 11:33.311
Let's go, go, go, go, go!

11:33.318 --> 11:34.149
Let's go!

11:34.152 --> 11:37.941
Where the fuck
are they all coming from?

11:37.947 --> 11:38.778
Get the fuck back!

11:38.781 --> 11:40.192
Everyone, head for it go.

11:40.200 --> 11:41.691
Go, go, go, go.

11:41.701 --> 11:43.488
Lau, get in, get the fuck in.

12:10.563 --> 12:12.350
Laboratory tests, day 31.

12:13.858 --> 12:16.976
Upon observing behavior
in our test subjects,

12:16.986 --> 12:18.727
there are signs which indicate

12:18.738 --> 12:20.570
developing sense of awareness.

12:22.909 --> 12:24.901
Certain specimens, we have found,

12:24.911 --> 12:27.870
have a higher level of
adrenaline and testosterone

12:27.872 --> 12:31.240
in their systems.

12:32.252 --> 12:35.086
We believe it's why they have
become harder to take down.

12:43.429 --> 12:46.092
Every day we learn something
new about the virus.

12:48.476 --> 12:52.015
It's been 31 days since
the outbreak first started

12:52.021 --> 12:54.308
and we are no closer to finding a cure.

13:02.490 --> 13:03.490
Hi, Ben.

13:27.974 --> 13:28.805
We're gonna need a vehicle

13:28.808 --> 13:31.141
to get to the next location.

14:09.807 --> 14:12.390
My name is Miranda, a survivor

14:12.393 --> 14:14.476
trapped within the quarantine zone.

14:14.479 --> 14:17.392
Along with others we took
refuge in God's sanctuary,

14:17.398 --> 14:20.607
living off the decaying lands,
trying to survive waiting

14:20.610 --> 14:22.818
and hoping that help may one day arrive.

14:23.988 --> 14:26.071
Today we were ambushed by a human gang

14:26.074 --> 14:27.736
for trespassing on their land.

14:27.742 --> 14:29.574
I lost good people over food.

14:30.703 --> 14:33.946
If anyone is hearing this, please help us.

14:34.832 --> 14:35.832
Miranda out.

14:37.502 --> 14:38.413
We got more of
those things down there

14:38.419 --> 14:40.376
than we got bullets.

14:40.380 --> 14:42.121
Choose your targets wisely.

15:02.944 --> 15:06.028
No sign of human life, sir.

15:19.752 --> 15:21.789
Eagle One, this is Black Fox,

15:21.796 --> 15:24.083
we got a negative on location one.

15:24.090 --> 15:25.410
Moving on to the second location.

15:25.883 --> 15:26.883
Out.

15:42.150 --> 15:43.732
Hey, look up here, dead.

15:48.322 --> 15:49.858
Motherfucker pulled a gun on me.

15:49.866 --> 15:51.232
Knock it off, Rodrigo.

15:52.452 --> 15:54.068
Save your ammo.

15:54.078 --> 15:56.115
Help!

15:56.122 --> 15:57.283
Help!

15:57.290 --> 15:58.701
Help please!

15:58.708 --> 15:59.573
Help!

15:59.584 --> 16:00.584
Help us!

16:01.461 --> 16:02.461
Help!

16:03.504 --> 16:04.504
Help!

16:10.553 --> 16:11.589
Why didn't they stop?

16:20.104 --> 16:22.141
Next LV point up ahead, sir.

16:30.740 --> 16:32.902
Let's move out.

16:48.591 --> 16:51.334
Private Bernstein, where to?

16:51.344 --> 16:54.007
Apartment 510 according
to the major's intel.

16:54.013 --> 16:55.504
Top floor.

16:55.515 --> 16:56.515
Let's go.

17:11.906 --> 17:15.365
♪ Leaving in my private business ♪

17:15.367 --> 17:19.078
♪ I just know it's what we're missing ♪

17:19.079 --> 17:24.075
♪ We're all zombies
when it comes to love ♪

17:26.628 --> 17:30.248
♪ You don't want my impression ♪

17:30.258 --> 17:32.716
♪ I'll waste it all ♪

17:57.785 --> 17:58.616
Clear!

18:15.761 --> 18:18.128
It's gonna put me off porn for life.

18:35.156 --> 18:36.156
Yeah!

18:47.460 --> 18:48.792
Die!

19:08.397 --> 19:10.184
I deliver you from evil.

19:28.876 --> 19:29.866
Where are we now?

19:29.877 --> 19:31.914
Upstairs, to the left.

19:33.089 --> 19:34.455
Frank, get going up with me.

19:34.465 --> 19:36.548
The rest of you, hold 'em off.

20:54.044 --> 20:56.457
Captain, it's this way.

21:00.050 --> 21:01.791
Hey, could we play.

21:06.140 --> 21:07.301
Oh shit!

22:00.986 --> 22:02.443
Ah!

22:17.169 --> 22:18.580
Ah!

22:22.883 --> 22:24.749
Leave me, that I demand!

22:24.760 --> 22:25.796
He's already dead!

22:25.803 --> 22:26.634
Get him to Raynes.

22:26.637 --> 22:27.969
If he's got a cure, we can save him.

22:37.815 --> 22:40.182
His apartment's around the corner.

23:01.589 --> 23:02.589
Clear!

23:06.802 --> 23:08.418
He's not here, Captain.

23:08.429 --> 23:10.011
Looks like he was taken
or left in a hurry.

23:10.014 --> 23:11.014
Son of a bitch!

23:13.309 --> 23:15.346
Search this place for an antidote

23:15.352 --> 23:17.594
and tear this place bit
by bit if you have to.

23:17.605 --> 23:18.605
Yes, sir.

23:28.949 --> 23:31.532
Hang in there, Corporal.

23:31.535 --> 23:34.118
Don't let me turn into
one of those things, Padre.

23:34.121 --> 23:36.579
It's gonna ease the pain, okay?

23:42.254 --> 23:44.086
You're wasting your time.

23:44.089 --> 23:47.332
There's nothing here and
he's not gonna look left.

23:47.343 --> 23:48.504
Okay, right.

23:50.554 --> 23:51.554
Anything?

23:53.724 --> 23:55.260
Fuck!

23:55.267 --> 23:58.431
Hey!

24:00.314 --> 24:02.351
Right now, the best thing we can do

24:02.358 --> 24:05.317
is put a bullet in his head,
put him out of his misery!

24:05.319 --> 24:08.483
You put a bullet in him,
I put a bullet in you.

24:15.412 --> 24:16.323
He's fucked!

24:16.330 --> 24:17.662
You ain't puttin' a
fucking bullet in him!

24:17.665 --> 24:19.247
Everybody stand down!

24:20.334 --> 24:21.996
I said stand down!

24:29.468 --> 24:30.754
I'm sorry, boss.

24:30.761 --> 24:32.047
You need to stick together.

24:56.370 --> 24:58.032
Why didn't they stop.

24:58.038 --> 24:59.700
Maybe they didn't see us.

25:11.051 --> 25:12.051
Don't look at them.

25:13.846 --> 25:17.260
The inability to
evacuate thousands of survivors

25:17.266 --> 25:19.474
has left them trapped.

25:19.476 --> 25:22.469
The streets of the quarantine
zone continue to become

25:22.479 --> 25:24.220
more and more dangerous.

25:30.904 --> 25:33.612
Criminals and gangs have
claimed their territories

25:33.615 --> 25:35.652
within the quarantine zone.

25:35.659 --> 25:38.367
Trespassing on their territory can result

25:38.370 --> 25:39.861
in the death penalty

25:42.374 --> 25:46.209
while the threat from the
infected continues to grow.

26:00.768 --> 26:03.260
Who is responsible for this?

26:05.064 --> 26:06.064
Soldiers.

26:07.858 --> 26:09.474
They came upon us in vehicles.

26:11.153 --> 26:11.984
We didn't engage.

26:11.987 --> 26:13.649
They just opened fire.

26:15.365 --> 26:17.652
I want these bastards found, now!

26:23.791 --> 26:26.408
We're gonna spend the night
here and move out first light.

26:26.418 --> 26:28.501
Raynes is still out there.

27:27.062 --> 27:30.100
They appear to be evolving, more aware

27:30.107 --> 27:31.223
of their surroundings.

27:32.693 --> 27:36.733
I believe that the infection
causes them to attack.

27:36.738 --> 27:39.321
No longer is it simple aggression,

27:39.324 --> 27:41.281
but out of fear and paranoia.

27:42.828 --> 27:43.828
Kill or be killed.

27:47.166 --> 27:49.078
A few hours ago I evaded capture

27:49.084 --> 27:52.577
by a troop of infected soldiers.

27:52.588 --> 27:54.625
They seem to be rounding up
anyone who isn't infected,

27:54.631 --> 27:56.839
men, women, and children.

27:58.218 --> 28:00.961
Where they're taking them I'm not sure.

28:00.971 --> 28:03.008
When was that recorded, mate?

28:04.266 --> 28:05.347
36 hours ago.

28:07.519 --> 28:09.306
There's a chance he's still alive.

28:51.063 --> 28:53.146
I'm not gonna hurt you.

28:54.733 --> 28:55.814
Stay away from us.

29:04.993 --> 29:08.236
He was a good soldier and a good man.

29:13.669 --> 29:14.876
Jacob knew the risks.

29:16.463 --> 29:17.463
We all do.

29:20.801 --> 29:23.418
And I believe he would want
us to see this through.

29:51.832 --> 29:53.073
See ya, big man.

30:03.677 --> 30:05.418
And the days grow long.

30:06.471 --> 30:09.555
Morale and spirit in the safe zone is low.

30:10.809 --> 30:13.517
Our defenses are being
pushed to the limit.

30:15.022 --> 30:16.763
Right now we have no cure,

30:17.733 --> 30:22.319
but all we can hope is that
Raynes is out there somewhere.

30:31.913 --> 30:32.949
What is that smell?

30:37.919 --> 30:39.285
What is that fucking smell?

30:41.423 --> 30:42.379
Jesus!

31:15.123 --> 31:17.035
It's a military convoy.

31:17.042 --> 31:18.829
But they look protected.

31:18.835 --> 31:19.951
And they are armed.

31:23.382 --> 31:26.250
We're running low on
ammo and let's avoid battle

31:26.259 --> 31:27.259
this time around.

31:28.011 --> 31:29.011
Let's take cover.

31:48.657 --> 31:50.319
Everyone, stay down.

31:53.203 --> 31:55.195
Do not engage the enemy.

32:46.131 --> 32:48.123
What the fuck just happened there?

32:48.133 --> 32:49.749
There were survivors on the truck.

32:49.759 --> 32:51.466
Where the hell are they taking them?

32:51.470 --> 32:52.881
We can follow his tracker.

33:28.131 --> 33:30.339
We have noted
through observations and studies

33:30.342 --> 33:33.710
on our own test subjects
that as time progresses,

33:34.554 --> 33:37.843
the infected appear to be
growing in intelligence

33:38.683 --> 33:41.016
learning to work together
and organize themselves.

33:41.978 --> 33:43.935
It is quite remarkable.

33:43.939 --> 33:47.057
It points to higher brain
functionality on a level

33:47.067 --> 33:48.558
we could never have predicted.

35:35.133 --> 35:36.123
Sir?

35:36.134 --> 35:37.134
Go ahead.

35:38.803 --> 35:41.261
I have a positive ID on our target.

35:41.264 --> 35:42.630
He's here in the bunker.

35:42.641 --> 35:44.257
Are you sure it's him?

35:45.143 --> 35:46.259
Yes, sir.

35:46.269 --> 35:47.635
Stay as you are.

35:47.646 --> 35:49.512
Don't make any contact.

35:49.522 --> 35:51.479
We're heading to your position.

35:51.483 --> 35:52.314
Understood, Captain.

35:52.317 --> 35:53.683
Well, I'll be goddamned.

35:55.111 --> 35:56.602
Fucker's still alive.

35:56.613 --> 35:58.525
We should wait until it gets dark.

35:58.531 --> 35:59.988
We can catch them off guard.

35:59.991 --> 36:02.324
If we stay, they'll be dead.

36:03.411 --> 36:05.027
I'm with you, Captain.

36:05.038 --> 36:07.621
And how do you propose
we get in there undetected?

36:25.100 --> 36:26.100
We'll improvise.

36:28.103 --> 36:29.639
I only hope this works.

36:29.646 --> 36:31.729
Really not in the mood to be eaten.

36:31.731 --> 36:33.723
Dessert, we're all fucked.

36:39.364 --> 36:42.402
I fuckin' stink.

37:02.929 --> 37:07.924
Perez, Reeves, take a position outside.

37:07.976 --> 37:08.976
Keep an eye out.

37:10.145 --> 37:14.059
Kira, your eyes, keep 'em sharp.

37:21.197 --> 37:22.278
He's there, Captain.

37:22.282 --> 37:23.568
Dr. Julian Raynes?

37:30.498 --> 37:32.535
I'm Captain Marcus Stanton.

37:32.542 --> 37:34.408
We've been sent here to evacuate you.

37:35.253 --> 37:36.414
Who sent you?

37:36.421 --> 37:37.502
We don't have time for questions.

37:37.505 --> 37:38.621
We need to leave.

37:39.466 --> 37:40.297
Stay away.

37:40.300 --> 37:41.461
Hey, hey, hey.

37:45.305 --> 37:47.171
What the hell's takin' 'em so long?

37:48.516 --> 37:50.428
We've got a problem here.

37:53.188 --> 37:54.804
We are not here to hurt you.

37:54.814 --> 37:55.645
You're lying to me.

37:55.648 --> 37:56.729
Listen to me, Doc.

37:56.733 --> 37:59.191
You can either come with us.

37:59.194 --> 38:00.230
No.

38:00.236 --> 38:02.353
Or stay here with
those things out there.

38:09.788 --> 38:12.155
Oh, you dumb fuck.

38:12.165 --> 38:15.704
Eagle One, this is Black
Fox, we have package.

38:15.710 --> 38:17.201
Moving over to RV point.

38:17.212 --> 38:19.044
Will rec here and hold up till pickup.

38:19.047 --> 38:20.379
Over and out.

38:20.381 --> 38:21.337
Let's go.

38:24.260 --> 38:25.260
What about us?

38:31.434 --> 38:33.221
We cannot leave them, Captain.

38:33.228 --> 38:34.228
We can't.

38:36.731 --> 38:38.222
Come on, let's go.

38:38.233 --> 38:39.233
Let's go.

38:39.901 --> 38:41.984
Let's get outta here.

38:41.986 --> 38:44.353
This ain't no fucking field trip.

38:45.448 --> 38:47.030
Our mission is Raynes.

38:47.033 --> 38:49.116
We are not leaving them.

38:49.118 --> 38:53.078
All right, guys, are
pleasantries out of the way?

38:53.081 --> 38:53.912
Good.

38:53.915 --> 38:55.497
Let's get the fuck outta here now.

38:55.500 --> 38:57.241
For fuck sake!

38:57.252 --> 38:58.743
Shit man, an asshole.

38:58.753 --> 38:59.753
Let's go.

39:15.311 --> 39:19.351
Captain, I suggest you get
the hell out of there now.

39:19.357 --> 39:20.848
Roger that, Kira.

39:20.859 --> 39:22.316
Come on, everyone, let's move.

39:24.779 --> 39:27.271
Everyone take cover!

39:27.282 --> 39:30.525
Enemy fire, it's an ambush.

39:31.786 --> 39:32.617
Fire at will.

39:32.620 --> 39:34.782
We need to push them back!

39:36.541 --> 39:38.123
Draw a path for the survivors.

39:38.126 --> 39:39.126
Now!

39:41.379 --> 39:42.210
Shoot!

39:47.510 --> 39:49.672
I'm with Raynes.

39:55.018 --> 39:57.431
On your six, attack now.

39:57.437 --> 39:58.769
Go Perez.

39:58.771 --> 40:00.808
Bring him back!

40:14.287 --> 40:16.825
Dr. Raynes, we are getting you out.

40:16.831 --> 40:18.788
Come with us!

40:18.791 --> 40:20.123
Come on.

40:20.126 --> 40:22.209
Look out!

40:22.211 --> 40:23.372
Lau!

40:36.726 --> 40:37.967
Get Raynes out of here.

40:37.977 --> 40:38.808
Come on, here.

40:38.811 --> 40:39.927
I'll hold them off.

40:39.938 --> 40:40.938
Go!

40:42.607 --> 40:45.645
Operates, proceed to northwest.

40:47.487 --> 40:48.318
Don't come out.

40:48.321 --> 40:49.357
Reeves come in with the others.

40:49.364 --> 40:50.696
I'll follow him.

40:57.830 --> 40:58.661
Have to go.

40:58.665 --> 41:00.907
Fuck you, we ain't
leaving them out there!

41:00.917 --> 41:02.283
You three, get Raynes out of here.

41:02.293 --> 41:04.330
I'll go back for them.

41:04.337 --> 41:05.828
Move.

41:05.838 --> 41:06.669
Go or we're all fucked.

41:06.673 --> 41:07.914
Come on, you piece of shit.

41:07.924 --> 41:09.586
Let's go, let's fucking go.

41:09.592 --> 41:10.592
Move, move!

41:42.250 --> 41:44.663
You son of a bitch.

41:44.669 --> 41:45.500
Get away.

41:51.175 --> 41:52.666
Get away from her.

42:32.675 --> 42:35.543
Where are they?

42:35.553 --> 42:37.715
They didn't make it out.

42:37.722 --> 42:38.553
Come on.

42:38.556 --> 42:39.556
Hey!

42:40.850 --> 42:42.341
Well, we gotta go back.

42:42.351 --> 42:43.351
Listen to me.

42:44.270 --> 42:45.636
Do you wanna die?

42:45.646 --> 42:47.012
Well, snap out of it.

42:48.900 --> 42:51.062
They're gone and there's
nothing we can do.

42:53.029 --> 42:54.029
Perez is right.

42:54.864 --> 42:55.864
We need to go.

42:57.658 --> 42:58.658
Move.

43:02.163 --> 43:03.163
Let's go.

43:06.542 --> 43:08.955
Rachel!

43:08.961 --> 43:09.961
Wake up!

43:10.838 --> 43:11.669
Come on.

43:11.672 --> 43:12.672
Rachel.

43:15.176 --> 43:19.216
I'll distract them.

43:20.223 --> 43:22.465
You and Kira make a run for it.

43:23.392 --> 43:24.974
We're not leaving you behind.

43:24.977 --> 43:28.641
I'll be, but there's nothing you can do.

43:28.648 --> 43:33.643
Tell my wife I am sorry, sorry
I could not be there for her.

43:35.238 --> 43:39.232
It was an honor to
serve with you, Captain.

43:39.242 --> 43:43.737
The honor was all mine.

44:49.187 --> 44:50.894
We have to go back!

44:50.897 --> 44:52.763
We have to get my sister.

44:52.773 --> 44:54.810
We can't leave her.

44:54.817 --> 44:56.433
I'm sorry, she's gone.

45:02.366 --> 45:05.200
You didn't even try to save her.

45:06.078 --> 45:07.865
She's not dead.

45:07.872 --> 45:10.615
It won't be long before she
becomes one of those things.

45:20.259 --> 45:22.216
It'll be okay.

45:22.220 --> 45:23.220
We'll keep you safe.

45:33.397 --> 45:35.480
It'll all be over soon.

45:36.901 --> 45:37.937
Just a little longer.

45:40.154 --> 45:41.154
Hold on.

45:56.462 --> 45:57.828
You can't take me back, please.

45:57.838 --> 45:58.828
You shut up.

45:58.839 --> 45:59.704
You don't understand.

45:59.715 --> 46:00.546
If you take me back I'm a dead man.

46:00.549 --> 46:02.791
You're a dead man now if
you don't shut your mouth

46:02.802 --> 46:04.009
and keep walking.

46:04.011 --> 46:04.922
Move!

46:14.855 --> 46:16.517
Please help us.

46:16.524 --> 46:17.560
Our car broke down.

46:18.734 --> 46:21.977
We heard of a camp of
survivors on the outskirts

46:21.988 --> 46:22.988
of the city.

46:23.864 --> 46:26.322
We were going there until we broke down.

46:26.325 --> 46:29.489
Please, can you help us?

46:30.663 --> 46:32.529
We should at least help
them get on their way.

46:32.540 --> 46:33.371
We don't have time.

46:33.374 --> 46:34.374
Let's go.

46:36.002 --> 46:37.038
Please help us.

46:39.964 --> 46:41.250
Oh, what the fuck!

46:41.257 --> 46:42.257
Jesus!

46:52.935 --> 46:54.676
What the hell was that?

46:55.688 --> 46:57.304
Hey, I'm talking to you, bastard.

46:59.317 --> 47:00.603
They were civilians.

47:00.609 --> 47:02.851
Fightin' a war in case
you haven't noticed.

47:02.862 --> 47:05.900
And in war there are fucking casualties.

47:05.906 --> 47:07.818
Human life is sacred.

47:07.825 --> 47:10.112
You take that away from
someone, might as well wanna be

47:10.119 --> 47:12.202
one of those things out there.

47:12.204 --> 47:15.163
Your family would've been ashamed of you.

47:21.005 --> 47:22.005
Hey.

47:30.306 --> 47:31.387
We should stop this.

47:34.226 --> 47:35.512
Nah, fuck 'em.

47:39.607 --> 47:40.607
Get up.

47:41.734 --> 47:42.734
Yah!

47:50.618 --> 47:51.859
Get Ivan on the radio.

47:52.745 --> 47:54.657
Tell 'em we've got him.

48:09.720 --> 48:11.427
God hasn't abandoned you.

48:11.430 --> 48:14.389
And neither will we no
matter what you think.

48:21.690 --> 48:22.555
Here, here, here.

49:02.773 --> 49:04.184
Fuck!

49:18.998 --> 49:19.829
No!

49:41.645 --> 49:42.645
Go!

50:02.750 --> 50:03.991
Go, go, go, go!

50:12.218 --> 50:14.175
Where the hell are we?

50:14.178 --> 50:15.510
Ah, it's an abandoned wing

50:15.513 --> 50:17.846
dating back to World War Il.

50:42.623 --> 50:45.366
You were testing on prisoners?

50:50.631 --> 50:53.465
Reeves, Lau, your Captain, Kira,

50:57.721 --> 50:59.963
all blood on this motherfucker's hands.

51:02.726 --> 51:05.059
This is our chance at payback.

51:06.355 --> 51:09.223
You got nowhere to run, nowhere to hide.

51:11.902 --> 51:14.645
And once we take you
back, you're gonna pay

51:14.655 --> 51:16.772
for everything you've caused.

51:18.117 --> 51:19.483
Stay back.

51:19.493 --> 51:21.109
I'll shoot.

51:21.120 --> 51:22.120
Do it.

51:23.247 --> 51:25.409
I said, fucking do it!

51:29.837 --> 51:31.749
This man doesn't deserve our sympathy.

51:32.631 --> 51:34.247
If you won't do it for yourself,

51:36.135 --> 51:37.421
then do it for Kira.

51:54.737 --> 51:56.603
Rodrigo, what the hell
do you think you're doing?

51:57.823 --> 51:59.234
This is wrong.

51:59.241 --> 52:00.607
Stop it, you're killing him.

52:00.618 --> 52:01.984
We need him alive.

52:07.958 --> 52:09.745
I'm sorry, kid, I'm sorry.

52:09.752 --> 52:11.368
You all right?

52:11.378 --> 52:13.335
That's enough, Frank.

52:13.339 --> 52:15.877
I said that's enough!

52:17.509 --> 52:19.125
What the hell's going on here?

52:22.222 --> 52:24.054
Captain, you're alive.

52:25.142 --> 52:26.258
We thought you were dead.

52:26.268 --> 52:28.260
We would've been if it wasn't for Lau.

52:29.146 --> 52:30.146
He didn't make it.

52:31.273 --> 52:32.273
How'd you find us?

52:33.651 --> 52:36.189
Put it on Raynes back at the camp.

52:36.195 --> 52:37.936
Figured he might make a run for it.

52:39.657 --> 52:40.898
Where is Sergeant Reeves?

52:44.453 --> 52:45.819
We were ambushed.

52:49.917 --> 52:52.751
You ran, Frank, I saw you.

52:53.796 --> 52:54.832
You ran.

52:54.838 --> 52:57.046
You would've done the
same in my position.

52:57.049 --> 52:58.415
You were as good as dead.

53:01.470 --> 53:04.304
You just can't
help yourself, can you?

53:04.306 --> 53:06.844
You know why Smith assigned
me on this mission?

53:07.726 --> 53:10.218
Because he didn't think you were up to it.

53:10.229 --> 53:11.229
And he was right.

53:12.356 --> 53:14.814
You're weak and you're the one

53:14.817 --> 53:16.604
that's getting your team killed!

53:28.956 --> 53:29.956
Come on!

53:30.749 --> 53:35.744
Get up, get up!

54:03.574 --> 54:05.440
Cap, Cap, Cap, Cap.

54:05.451 --> 54:06.451
That's enough.

54:08.620 --> 54:09.610
Rodrigo.

54:09.621 --> 54:10.828
Sir.

54:10.831 --> 54:11.992
Kira.

54:11.999 --> 54:12.830
Yes, sir.

54:12.833 --> 54:14.369
Take his guns and lock him up.

54:15.335 --> 54:18.499
All right, you piece of shit.

54:18.505 --> 54:19.621
He's not your friend.

54:21.133 --> 54:22.133
Don't forget it.

54:23.385 --> 54:25.752
He's the reason why your wife is dead.

54:25.763 --> 54:27.880
Shut up,
you fuckin'.

54:29.266 --> 54:30.266
Fuck off.

54:32.686 --> 54:35.474
Captain, I don't know
if it means anything,

54:36.482 --> 54:38.394
but we heard talk of a camp for survivors.

54:39.234 --> 54:41.271
On the outskirts of the city?

54:42.738 --> 54:46.152
We focus on the mission at hand.

54:46.158 --> 54:47.820
That is our priority.

54:50.120 --> 54:51.120
Sir.

54:52.664 --> 54:56.829
Get out, you fucking.

54:57.878 --> 54:58.959
Sleep it off.

55:04.134 --> 55:08.925
Kira, look he told me you were all gone.

55:08.931 --> 55:10.672
If I knew, I woulda
never left you out there.

55:10.682 --> 55:11.763
You gotta believe me.

55:13.560 --> 55:15.847
I just need to be on my own.

55:19.358 --> 55:23.523
Few years ago, I was heading
a successful research team

55:23.529 --> 55:24.861
involved in some

55:26.532 --> 55:29.741
highly controversial
genetic manipulations,

55:29.743 --> 55:30.950
stem cell research.

55:31.995 --> 55:34.282
When our funding ran
out, we were approached

55:34.289 --> 55:38.659
by the military who presented
a very generous offer.

55:39.503 --> 55:40.994
The military?

55:41.004 --> 55:43.997
They wanted an advantage
on the battlefield,

55:44.007 --> 55:47.967
something that would give
'em an edge over the enemy.

55:47.970 --> 55:51.134
They wanted us to create a new drug,

55:51.139 --> 55:53.973
which would enhance the
soldiers' physical ability

55:53.976 --> 55:57.515
in terms of punishing.

55:57.521 --> 56:00.229
The powers that be were impatient

56:00.232 --> 56:02.394
and they demanded results.

56:24.214 --> 56:25.204
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

56:25.215 --> 56:26.215
Don't shoot.

56:27.301 --> 56:28.301
It's only me.

56:29.720 --> 56:30.551
Look uh...

56:30.554 --> 56:31.840
Don't come any closer.

56:34.016 --> 56:35.973
Look, Kira, you're scaring me now.

56:35.976 --> 56:36.976
Put the gun down.

56:49.823 --> 56:52.281
I've been infected at the camp.

56:52.284 --> 56:53.284
Oh fuck.

56:55.329 --> 56:56.445
Let's make it quick.

56:58.874 --> 57:00.661
Ah Jesus, fuck.

57:11.386 --> 57:12.386
Jesus, fuck!

57:13.722 --> 57:14.722
Fuck!

57:16.975 --> 57:18.011
Come here, come here.

57:37.746 --> 57:39.578
Why did you do that?

57:41.249 --> 57:42.249
You're infected now.

57:43.794 --> 57:45.080
I'm not gonna leave you.

57:46.755 --> 57:47.755
Right?

57:48.590 --> 57:52.083
Tell me about patient zero.

57:52.094 --> 57:53.094
James Rowan.

57:54.012 --> 57:55.878
He was one of our first test subjects.

57:58.016 --> 58:01.054
Unlike the others, it didn't fully mutate.

58:02.646 --> 58:05.980
He had the strength, the agility.

58:08.068 --> 58:09.900
Never fully took over.

58:14.866 --> 58:16.698
And we never knew why.

58:18.203 --> 58:20.741
He had some sort of natural immunity.

58:21.915 --> 58:24.623
There was a riot in the prison.

58:24.626 --> 58:26.288
It seemed perfect distraction

58:26.294 --> 58:28.911
for getting Rowan out.

58:31.216 --> 58:35.301
He was supposed to expose what
was going on to the world.

58:36.388 --> 58:39.051
Instead he unknowingly

58:40.892 --> 58:42.428
released the virus.

58:42.436 --> 58:45.179
Millions and millions of people are dead

58:45.188 --> 58:46.724
because of what you created.

58:49.735 --> 58:53.103
Do you understand the
magnitude of what you've done?

58:56.908 --> 58:59.400
I lost my wife because of you.

59:03.665 --> 59:05.998
And an unborn child I will never...

59:15.302 --> 59:16.634
Let's just hope

59:19.139 --> 59:22.803
you can get us out of all of this chaos.

59:59.638 --> 01:00:01.721
I'm not gonna hurt you.

01:00:07.854 --> 01:00:09.846
Sh, sh, sh, it's okay.

01:00:11.691 --> 01:00:12.691
I'm here.

01:00:15.028 --> 01:00:17.065
Not going anywhere, okay?

01:00:41.138 --> 01:00:45.508
Listen, Frank, I really don't
care what you think about me

01:00:46.601 --> 01:00:48.718
but we're in this together

01:00:48.728 --> 01:00:50.014
whether you like it or not.

01:00:52.732 --> 01:00:54.439
Come on, Alicia, let's go.

01:00:57.612 --> 01:00:59.069
Let's go, let's go.

01:00:59.906 --> 01:01:00.906
You all right?

01:01:05.871 --> 01:01:07.612
It's all right, it's
all right, gotta move.

01:01:07.622 --> 01:01:08.622
Let's go!

01:01:09.332 --> 01:01:10.163
Let's go, let's go.

01:01:10.167 --> 01:01:11.328
Kira!

01:01:11.334 --> 01:01:12.700
Rodrigo!

01:01:15.630 --> 01:01:18.839
All right, here's what's gonna happen.

01:01:18.842 --> 01:01:23.337
Me, Kira, and the doc here,
we're just gonna walk away.

01:01:23.346 --> 01:01:24.837
Don't try to stop us.

01:01:24.848 --> 01:01:26.714
Drop your weapon.

01:01:26.725 --> 01:01:28.967
It doesn't have to end like this.

01:01:28.977 --> 01:01:31.014
You ain't as fast as
you think you are, Cap.

01:01:31.021 --> 01:01:34.890
Doctor, is there anything you can do?

01:01:34.900 --> 01:01:35.811
Please.

01:01:35.817 --> 01:01:36.817
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:01:38.528 --> 01:01:39.393
You're too far gone.

01:01:39.404 --> 01:01:40.404
No, fuck that!

01:01:41.364 --> 01:01:42.775
He's lying!

01:01:42.782 --> 01:01:44.239
The doc's lying!

01:01:50.123 --> 01:01:51.955
Take cover!

01:02:05.430 --> 01:02:06.261
Perez!

01:02:06.264 --> 01:02:07.095
Sir!

01:02:07.098 --> 01:02:09.260
I need you to cover
Bernstein and Dr. Raynes

01:02:09.267 --> 01:02:10.428
at my command.

01:02:10.435 --> 01:02:12.347
Okay got it!

01:02:12.354 --> 01:02:13.640
Now!

01:02:14.481 --> 01:02:16.473
Come on, come on.

01:02:24.574 --> 01:02:26.156
Get in the car or you won't last.

01:02:26.159 --> 01:02:27.650
Go!

01:02:42.926 --> 01:02:44.383
Come on!

01:02:47.138 --> 01:02:48.138
Forget 'em!

01:03:20.672 --> 01:03:22.834
Thank you for saving me.

01:03:51.494 --> 01:03:54.987
Eagle One, this is Black Fox.

01:03:54.998 --> 01:03:58.082
Just checking on our ride
out of this shit hole.

01:03:58.084 --> 01:04:00.497
Are we still good for 1600 hours pickup?

01:04:02.172 --> 01:04:05.085
Be advised, we have five
assets for extraction.

01:04:05.091 --> 01:04:06.627
Do you copy?

01:04:06.634 --> 01:04:10.753
Black Fox, this is Eagle
One, that's a go on transport.

01:04:10.764 --> 01:04:12.380
See you soon.

01:04:12.390 --> 01:04:17.385
Out.

01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:06.942
There they are.

01:05:06.945 --> 01:05:08.436
Let's get it done.

01:05:19.541 --> 01:05:22.124
I want to give you something.

01:05:23.962 --> 01:05:25.294
What's this?

01:05:25.296 --> 01:05:26.832
Answers.

01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:27.921
Keep it safe.

01:05:29.259 --> 01:05:33.754
You'll find it useful if
anything should happen to me.

01:05:36.266 --> 01:05:38.553
No matter what happens, you find a way

01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:41.303
of getting that girl out of here.

01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:45.518
Things are not always what they seem.

01:05:45.525 --> 01:05:46.686
Remember that.

01:06:20.226 --> 01:06:22.309
Job well done, Captain.

01:06:24.939 --> 01:06:27.022
This is the end of the road.

01:06:49.631 --> 01:06:50.963
Sorry Captain.

01:06:52.383 --> 01:06:54.215
I'm just doing my job.

01:06:56.471 --> 01:06:57.587
It's nothing personal.

01:07:01.100 --> 01:07:02.100
Julian.

01:07:09.484 --> 01:07:10.565
It's been a long time.

01:07:14.572 --> 01:07:15.983
This ends today.

01:07:16.950 --> 01:07:18.691
No, no, no, no, no!

01:07:29.379 --> 01:07:30.995
What the hell did you just do?

01:07:31.005 --> 01:07:33.213
My little boy is gone
because of this man.

01:07:35.260 --> 01:07:38.253
Raynes needs to be found
and brought back alive.

01:07:38.263 --> 01:07:40.380
He may be the only hope of finding a cure.

01:07:41.266 --> 01:07:42.632
What about the cure?

01:07:42.642 --> 01:07:43.598
There never was.

01:07:46.688 --> 01:07:48.896
I lost half my team for this?

01:07:51.442 --> 01:07:53.434
No, Captain, your men died for my son.

01:07:54.779 --> 01:07:57.192
This is the only cure that exists.

01:07:59.534 --> 01:08:02.402
You're the one
responsible for all of this.

01:08:02.412 --> 01:08:04.495
We had to be sure before
we began the eradication

01:08:04.497 --> 01:08:05.658
of the quarantine zone.

01:08:06.624 --> 01:08:09.367
Raynes and his research
were the final loose end.

01:08:11.296 --> 01:08:14.004
Bernstein, do you have what I need?

01:08:27.228 --> 01:08:28.810
I'm sorry, Captain.

01:08:28.813 --> 01:08:30.554
You piece of shit.

01:08:30.564 --> 01:08:32.147
I trusted you.

01:08:32.149 --> 01:08:33.265
I had no choice.

01:08:34.777 --> 01:08:35.777
He has my parents.

01:08:37.322 --> 01:08:39.063
That concludes our business.

01:08:39.073 --> 01:08:40.073
Let's go.

01:08:43.453 --> 01:08:44.453
Hey!

01:08:46.747 --> 01:08:47.828
Take the girl.

01:08:58.091 --> 01:08:59.091
Sir.

01:09:02.013 --> 01:09:03.629
I'm sorry Lieutenant, your services

01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:05.221
are no longer required.

01:09:08.435 --> 01:09:09.801
Die!

01:10:38.317 --> 01:10:41.151
You have to leave me or we're all dead.

01:10:42.697 --> 01:10:44.484
You promise me one thing?

01:10:46.325 --> 01:10:48.282
You'll expose them.

01:10:48.286 --> 01:10:49.652
Expose 'em all!

01:10:51.748 --> 01:10:52.748
Now, go!

01:10:54.459 --> 01:10:55.575
It's been fun, Captain.

01:10:59.130 --> 01:11:00.792
Let's go!

01:11:17.064 --> 01:11:18.180
Let's play.

01:12:15.122 --> 01:12:16.122
Come on!

01:13:09.218 --> 01:13:13.303
You fucking bitch!

01:13:53.471 --> 01:13:56.589
Where are we going, Captain?

01:13:56.599 --> 01:13:57.965
Captain.

01:14:07.109 --> 01:14:08.190
I'm sorry, Captain.

01:14:08.194 --> 01:14:11.358
Now, I know I deserved that.

01:14:11.364 --> 01:14:13.526
Please, please believe me.

01:14:14.575 --> 01:14:15.941
I didn't know what he would do, Captain.

01:14:15.952 --> 01:14:16.952
Please believe me.

01:14:18.788 --> 01:14:21.030
Look at where the
fuck we are, Bernstein!

01:14:22.375 --> 01:14:23.616
My team are dead!

01:14:28.673 --> 01:14:30.255
For what?

01:14:30.257 --> 01:14:31.748
To collect intel?

01:14:31.759 --> 01:14:32.590
I'm sorry.

01:14:32.593 --> 01:14:34.585
Sorry ain't
gonna bring 'em back.

01:14:40.101 --> 01:14:42.013
Please, Captain, please.

01:14:42.019 --> 01:14:43.726
Don't leave me.

01:14:43.729 --> 01:14:44.729
I'm begging you.

01:14:45.564 --> 01:14:46.896
Please!

01:14:46.899 --> 01:14:47.899
Ca-captain!

01:14:50.069 --> 01:14:51.069
Please!

01:14:59.412 --> 01:15:02.120
You're not going to
leave me, Captain, are you?

01:15:03.332 --> 01:15:04.332
No.

01:15:07.878 --> 01:15:08.878
I promise.

01:15:12.925 --> 01:15:13.925
What's wrong?

01:15:15.094 --> 01:15:17.211
Nothing.

01:15:18.055 --> 01:15:19.591
Jesus.

01:15:19.598 --> 01:15:20.805
Not you.

01:15:20.808 --> 01:15:22.595
I'm sorry, I thought you would be mad

01:15:22.601 --> 01:15:23.601
if I told you.

01:15:24.645 --> 01:15:26.637
Let's go find somewhere safe, okay?

01:15:26.647 --> 01:15:28.479
Somewhere we can hide.

01:15:58.512 --> 01:16:02.256
He's the reason
why your wife died.

01:16:03.893 --> 01:16:04.724
The quarantine zone

01:16:04.727 --> 01:16:07.435
will be completely annihilated.

01:16:31.796 --> 01:16:33.128
Alicia.

01:16:36.467 --> 01:16:38.709
Alicia, what are you doing?

01:16:39.678 --> 01:16:40.678
You stop it!

01:16:41.931 --> 01:16:42.931
Stop!

01:17:18.342 --> 01:17:19.503
Who's there?

01:17:35.693 --> 01:17:36.693
He's clean.

01:17:40.531 --> 01:17:41.612
Come with us.

01:18:58.651 --> 01:18:59.892
You left me.

01:18:59.902 --> 01:19:02.064
You promised you'd never leave me.

01:19:02.071 --> 01:19:03.983
You lied to me, Captain.

01:19:05.699 --> 01:19:07.235
I'm sorry, Alicia.

01:19:07.243 --> 01:19:09.826
You left me, just like my dad.

01:19:09.828 --> 01:19:11.194
I know I made a mistake.

01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:14.747
I'm not going anywhere.

01:19:14.750 --> 01:19:16.537
But I'm infected.

01:19:16.543 --> 01:19:17.784
Don't worry about that.

01:19:18.921 --> 01:19:21.664
It's me and you against the world now.

01:19:21.674 --> 01:19:25.418
You're my mission and we're
gonna get through this together.

01:19:25.427 --> 01:19:26.258
I promise you.

01:19:40.776 --> 01:19:41.892
Is this everything?

01:19:41.902 --> 01:19:43.268
Yes, sir.

01:19:43.279 --> 01:19:44.770
And Raynes?

01:19:44.780 --> 01:19:46.396
Well, he no longer poses a threat.

01:19:47.324 --> 01:19:48.155
Good.

01:19:48.158 --> 01:19:50.571
We've seen how the
infected can work together.

01:19:51.745 --> 01:19:54.453
Imagine what we can do with
them once we can control them.

01:19:54.456 --> 01:19:55.913
Well, now that we have Raynes's research,

01:19:55.916 --> 01:19:58.374
we should finish what we started.

01:19:58.377 --> 01:20:03.122
Our only priority now
is to destroy all traces

01:20:03.132 --> 01:20:04.122
of the infection.

01:20:04.133 --> 01:20:06.716
With respect, sir, I strongly disagree.

01:20:06.719 --> 01:20:09.382
We are fighting for our survival.

01:20:09.388 --> 01:20:12.301
I respect the tragic loss of life.

01:20:12.308 --> 01:20:14.550
But we can honor them by finishing this,

01:20:14.560 --> 01:20:15.846
by creating the weapon

01:20:15.853 --> 01:20:18.266
we intended to defend
ourselves against our enemies.

01:20:18.272 --> 01:20:19.729
That is all.

01:20:22.067 --> 01:20:23.478
You're dismissed.

01:20:48.844 --> 01:20:52.588
Tell me, soldier, what are you

01:20:52.598 --> 01:20:54.510
and your men doing here?

01:20:54.516 --> 01:20:55.516
No.

01:20:58.270 --> 01:20:59.636
I despise your type.

01:21:00.898 --> 01:21:03.265
Got army blood running through your veins.

01:21:03.275 --> 01:21:06.518
Your weak misguided
sense of honor, loyalty.

01:21:06.528 --> 01:21:09.862
You're no better than
those things out there.

01:21:11.116 --> 01:21:13.859
How does it feel to be abandoned,

01:21:15.579 --> 01:21:20.574
to be left all alone out
here, no one to save you?

01:21:22.086 --> 01:21:26.626
Discarded just like those they tested on.

01:21:34.390 --> 01:21:36.507
The little one is infected.

01:21:38.102 --> 01:21:39.343
But you know this, right?

01:21:41.397 --> 01:21:43.138
She's just a kid.

01:21:43.148 --> 01:21:45.435
Well, it makes no difference to me.

01:21:45.442 --> 01:21:48.776
Please, she's all I have left.

01:21:48.779 --> 01:21:50.395
She's all I got.

01:21:50.406 --> 01:21:53.069
But she will die, you know that.

01:21:54.618 --> 01:21:57.952
But still you try to protect her.

01:21:59.832 --> 01:22:00.832
Why?

01:22:01.542 --> 01:22:03.829
A man like you could
never understand why.

01:22:06.046 --> 01:22:08.754
And you think I am
heartless man, Captain,

01:22:08.757 --> 01:22:12.467
that we haven't all lost
friends, family, not true!

01:22:15.764 --> 01:22:18.051
I like to think I am reasonable man.

01:22:23.939 --> 01:22:26.932
Shoot the girl or shoot yourself.

01:23:02.144 --> 01:23:03.260
Wait!

01:23:09.651 --> 01:23:11.483
You are so predictable.

01:23:12.654 --> 01:23:14.316
Bring the girl here!

01:23:20.996 --> 01:23:23.784
Let's make things a
little more interesting.

01:23:29.087 --> 01:23:30.087
Come on.

01:23:39.181 --> 01:23:41.264
I want you to take his life.

01:23:41.266 --> 01:23:44.134
You are one sick son of a bitch.

01:23:50.317 --> 01:23:52.650
I'm sorry, Captain.

01:23:52.653 --> 01:23:55.066
It's okay, Alicia, he's right.

01:23:56.448 --> 01:23:57.655
Save yourself.

01:23:58.909 --> 01:23:59.909
Captain's orders.

01:24:01.328 --> 01:24:03.160
No, no, no, no!

01:24:03.163 --> 01:24:04.825
No, no, no, no, no.

01:24:04.831 --> 01:24:06.868
I'm infected, Captain.

01:24:06.875 --> 01:24:08.286
He said I'm going to die

01:24:08.293 --> 01:24:10.660
and he said only one of us could leave.

01:24:10.671 --> 01:24:13.379
If you die, Captain, no
one will look after me.

01:24:13.382 --> 01:24:16.466
And I don't want to be on my own.

01:24:16.468 --> 01:24:18.710
You're the only friend I have left.

01:24:18.720 --> 01:24:20.712
It's okay, little one.

01:24:23.350 --> 01:24:24.350
It's okay.

01:24:32.192 --> 01:24:34.525
Where did you get this from?

01:24:37.155 --> 01:24:38.987
Where did you find it?

01:24:40.701 --> 01:24:42.533
My mom gave it to me.

01:24:45.122 --> 01:24:47.489
What is your name, little one?

01:24:47.499 --> 01:24:49.786
Alicia, Alicia Rowan.

01:24:49.793 --> 01:24:51.204
Son of a bitch!

01:24:52.629 --> 01:24:54.871
You're Jimmy's kid!

01:24:54.881 --> 01:24:56.463
Why the hell didn't you say so?

01:24:57.467 --> 01:24:58.548
It's Jimmy's kid!

01:25:00.012 --> 01:25:01.503
It's Jimmy's baby!

01:25:02.389 --> 01:25:06.053
Jimmy, Jimmy,
Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy.

01:25:11.898 --> 01:25:16.563
Our only priority
now is to destroy all traces

01:25:16.570 --> 01:25:17.981
of the infection.

01:26:12.459 --> 01:26:15.327
I am sorry for your loss, little one,

01:26:15.337 --> 01:26:17.624
but it is a cruel world we live in.

01:26:19.341 --> 01:26:21.128
I wish I could make you better.

01:26:23.387 --> 01:26:25.845
You are both welcome to stay.

01:26:25.847 --> 01:26:28.260
We have food, shelter.

01:26:28.266 --> 01:26:31.054
I'm afraid it's not over for us yet.

01:26:33.730 --> 01:26:37.223
How do we get out of here,
out of the quarantine zone?

01:26:40.570 --> 01:26:42.812
The nearest border is
around 20 miles east.

01:26:43.657 --> 01:26:45.489
Getting there is one thing.

01:26:45.492 --> 01:26:46.653
Crossing it another.

01:26:47.703 --> 01:26:50.537
It is heavily guarded with
orders to shoot on sight.

01:26:50.539 --> 01:26:52.531
And you're looking at hundreds of infected

01:26:52.541 --> 01:26:54.498
before you even get close.

01:26:54.501 --> 01:26:55.537
You'll never make it on your own.

01:26:55.544 --> 01:26:57.126
It would be suicide.

01:26:58.088 --> 01:26:59.954
One of my men said he heard of survivors

01:26:59.965 --> 01:27:01.422
at the outskirts of the city.

01:27:02.300 --> 01:27:03.300
Is that true?

01:27:04.261 --> 01:27:06.469
There is a group of armed survivors

01:27:06.471 --> 01:27:07.302
based en route.

01:27:07.305 --> 01:27:09.012
We had a couple of run-ins with them.

01:27:10.475 --> 01:27:11.636
Maybe they can help you.

01:27:12.769 --> 01:27:13.930
I don't like your odds.

01:27:15.772 --> 01:27:17.172
Then that's where we go.

01:27:18.233 --> 01:27:21.226
What you going to
do, march to the border

01:27:21.236 --> 01:27:22.477
with the survivors?

01:27:26.450 --> 01:27:29.363
You are one crazy bastard, Captain!

01:27:30.412 --> 01:27:31.412
I love you!

01:27:34.124 --> 01:27:35.410
This should help.

01:27:41.256 --> 01:27:42.256
Thank you.

01:27:43.967 --> 01:27:45.708
Why don't you come with us?

01:27:45.719 --> 01:27:48.928
This place won't be left
standing for much longer.

01:27:48.930 --> 01:27:50.796
Even if we made it
out to the other side,

01:27:50.807 --> 01:27:52.594
chances are we'd be locked up.

01:27:53.602 --> 01:27:55.969
There is no life for us
on the outside.

01:27:58.607 --> 01:27:59.607
Good luck.

01:28:13.830 --> 01:28:15.287
This is Captain Marcus Stanton.

01:28:15.290 --> 01:28:18.749
Can anyone hear me?

01:28:18.752 --> 01:28:20.084
Is anyone there?

01:28:22.088 --> 01:28:24.080
We're trapped inside the quarantine zone

01:28:25.300 --> 01:28:27.883
and we're about 10 miles
out of the eastern border.

01:29:39.541 --> 01:29:40.907
How's your arm?

01:29:40.917 --> 01:29:41.782
It's okay.

01:29:41.793 --> 01:29:42.954
It doesn't hurt now.

01:29:44.254 --> 01:29:45.165
Let me take a look.

01:29:59.769 --> 01:30:01.726
Alicia, have you been bit

01:30:03.982 --> 01:30:05.314
by those things before?

01:30:09.237 --> 01:30:11.479
Am I in trouble?

01:30:11.489 --> 01:30:13.321
No, no, no you're not.

01:30:27.756 --> 01:30:30.840
Patient zero's daughter like her father.

01:30:30.842 --> 01:30:33.425
The virus does not seem to
have mutated in the girl.

01:30:34.429 --> 01:30:35.795
Keep it safe.

01:30:35.805 --> 01:30:38.013
Things are not always what they seem.

01:30:38.016 --> 01:30:40.508
Shows no signs of any
side effects of the virus.

01:30:40.518 --> 01:30:42.760
Highly controversial
genetic manipulations.

01:30:43.813 --> 01:30:46.772
This must be due to her
unique genetic makeup.

01:30:46.775 --> 01:30:49.438
She must be protected at all costs.

01:30:49.444 --> 01:30:51.606
We were approached by the military.

01:30:51.613 --> 01:30:52.444
The military?

01:30:52.447 --> 01:30:54.939
This mission is strictly off the books.

01:30:54.950 --> 01:30:57.943
She could be used to
weaponize the virus.

01:30:57.953 --> 01:30:58.953
Not you.

01:31:02.165 --> 01:31:05.579
Dr. Raynes was watching
over you this whole time.

01:31:05.585 --> 01:31:06.996
That's why he stayed behind.

01:31:09.714 --> 01:31:10.670
I'm sorry, Ben.

01:31:15.887 --> 01:31:18.721
So, he wasn't a very good climber.

01:31:20.642 --> 01:31:23.259
Sir, we've just
intercepted a radio message

01:31:23.269 --> 01:31:26.228
from Captain Stanton from
inside the quarantine zone.

01:31:26.231 --> 01:31:27.187
He's alive.

01:31:27.190 --> 01:31:29.102
He's making his way to the eastern border.

01:31:34.781 --> 01:31:36.693
We're close.

01:31:38.994 --> 01:31:41.407
Captain, Captain.

01:31:42.664 --> 01:31:44.155
I know you're there.

01:31:47.544 --> 01:31:48.751
Smith...

01:31:48.753 --> 01:31:51.211
You've done
well to survive, Marcus.

01:31:51.214 --> 01:31:53.581
I trained you better than I thought.

01:31:53.591 --> 01:31:55.378
The girl you abandoned,

01:31:55.385 --> 01:31:58.298
the one I asked you to take, she's immune.

01:32:01.016 --> 01:32:03.679
Well, even if it were
true, it's too late.

01:32:04.769 --> 01:32:06.101
You listen to me, Smith,

01:32:07.564 --> 01:32:10.181
I'm gonna bring her back
and I'm coming to get you.

01:32:11.026 --> 01:32:13.894
You got a lot of blood on your hands.

01:32:13.903 --> 01:32:15.360
You got a lot to answer for.

01:32:18.074 --> 01:32:19.074
Come on, let's go.

01:32:27.167 --> 01:32:28.453
Fortify that checkpoint.

01:32:29.335 --> 01:32:31.497
Send more men if necessary.

01:32:31.504 --> 01:32:33.996
Under no circumstances is Captain Stanton

01:32:34.007 --> 01:32:36.090
or anyone else to get across that border.

01:32:37.844 --> 01:32:39.801
They're all infected.

01:32:49.230 --> 01:32:51.438
That's where we're gonna go, okay?

01:32:52.525 --> 01:32:54.642
But we need to get there
as quickly as possible.

01:32:54.652 --> 01:32:55.652
I'll race you.

01:33:02.827 --> 01:33:05.661
Come on, Captain, you're too slow.

01:33:18.968 --> 01:33:19.968
Captain!

01:33:27.102 --> 01:33:28.102
Oh shit!

01:33:29.479 --> 01:33:32.222
They walked straight into the minefield.

01:33:32.232 --> 01:33:33.643
Stay exactly where you are.

01:33:33.650 --> 01:33:35.141
I'm coming to get you, okay?

01:33:54.587 --> 01:33:56.499
No, Alicia, don't move.

01:33:57.590 --> 01:33:59.001
Can you sing me a song?

01:33:59.008 --> 01:34:00.340
What song?

01:34:00.343 --> 01:34:04.883
Do you know He's Got the
Whole World in His Hands?

01:34:06.015 --> 01:34:08.257
That song, okay?

01:34:09.686 --> 01:34:11.598
Close your eyes and sing with me, okay?

01:34:14.023 --> 01:34:17.812
♪ He's got the whole world ♪

01:34:17.819 --> 01:34:21.403
♪ In His hands ♪

01:34:36.838 --> 01:34:41.333
♪ He's got the whole world ♪

01:34:48.892 --> 01:34:51.976
Let's go.

01:35:00.445 --> 01:35:01.276
Cover your ears!

01:35:09.204 --> 01:35:10.204
Go!

01:35:11.664 --> 01:35:12.950
Behind you!

01:35:19.214 --> 01:35:20.375
Alicia, run!

01:35:41.069 --> 01:35:42.731
Captain, this way!

01:35:51.454 --> 01:35:53.036
We finish what we started.

01:36:23.486 --> 01:36:26.024
How did you get to
be here with all these people?

01:36:27.115 --> 01:36:29.072
I was a volunteer nurse helping out

01:36:29.075 --> 01:36:30.407
when the virus first broke.

01:36:31.536 --> 01:36:33.619
We had no idea how fast it would spread.

01:36:34.747 --> 01:36:36.283
Eventually we made it out here.

01:36:37.292 --> 01:36:38.408
We had hoped to head for the border,

01:36:38.418 --> 01:36:41.411
but there was just too many
of those things out there.

01:36:41.421 --> 01:36:44.459
You're gonna have to leave
this place, all of you.

01:36:44.465 --> 01:36:47.924
You're asking me to walk 200
people out to certain death.

01:36:47.927 --> 01:36:49.043
Why would I want to do that?

01:36:49.053 --> 01:36:51.386
The military are
commencing a strike order

01:36:51.389 --> 01:36:52.675
in the quarantine zone.

01:36:52.682 --> 01:36:55.174
You are just collateral damage.

01:36:55.184 --> 01:36:57.801
Everything this side of
the border will be dead

01:36:57.812 --> 01:36:59.053
in less than three hours.

01:37:00.315 --> 01:37:01.146
I don't believe you.

01:37:01.149 --> 01:37:02.560
They wouldn't.

01:37:02.567 --> 01:37:03.398
There are too many survivors.

01:37:03.401 --> 01:37:04.562
It would be murder.

01:37:04.569 --> 01:37:08.358
Then tell me this, how many
search and rescue helicopters

01:37:08.364 --> 01:37:11.732
have you seen fly overhead?

01:37:11.743 --> 01:37:14.110
They know you're here but
they're not coming to get you.

01:37:14.120 --> 01:37:15.907
I'm sorry, I wish I was wrong.

01:37:19.542 --> 01:37:22.410
They are getting ready to strike.

01:37:22.420 --> 01:37:23.911
They have left us here to die.

01:37:24.756 --> 01:37:27.214
They've never had any
intentions of rescuing you.

01:37:28.426 --> 01:37:30.509
You're talking about genocide.

01:37:32.013 --> 01:37:36.098
The only thing they care
about is containing this virus.

01:37:37.143 --> 01:37:39.385
As far as they're
concerned, we already dead.

01:37:41.481 --> 01:37:44.098
What we need to do now is
leave and head to the border

01:37:44.108 --> 01:37:45.974
as quickly as possible.

01:37:45.985 --> 01:37:47.647
It's our only chance.

01:37:47.653 --> 01:37:48.894
Why should I trust you?

01:37:51.491 --> 01:37:55.201
If Alicia holds the
key to that antidote,

01:37:55.203 --> 01:37:56.819
I will do everything in my power

01:37:56.829 --> 01:37:58.866
to get her across that border.

01:37:58.873 --> 01:38:00.580
We came here to find a cure.

01:38:02.168 --> 01:38:04.535
And I am gonna complete my mission.

01:38:04.545 --> 01:38:07.003
And I will do this with or without you.

01:38:08.424 --> 01:38:09.960
I could do with you by my side,

01:38:10.927 --> 01:38:12.919
but if you chose to stay, you will die.

01:38:53.803 --> 01:38:55.135
Come on!

01:42:27.224 --> 01:42:29.807
Let's go, to get her out of here.

01:42:29.810 --> 01:42:31.722
Get Alicia to safety.

01:42:36.275 --> 01:42:37.275
Come on!

01:43:12.353 --> 01:43:14.970
I got bitten and I got better.

01:43:14.980 --> 01:43:17.063
You'll be okay, you have to be.

01:43:17.066 --> 01:43:18.523
You said you'd protect me.

01:43:24.657 --> 01:43:28.150
Uh, I need you, I need you to take this,

01:43:30.246 --> 01:43:31.327
keep it safe.

01:43:37.753 --> 01:43:42.418
Alicia, life doesn't always
work out the way we planned.

01:43:45.010 --> 01:43:48.879
You said it was me and
you against the world.

01:43:52.101 --> 01:43:53.101
I'm sorry.

01:43:55.229 --> 01:43:57.186
I can't do this, Alicia.

01:43:58.065 --> 01:43:59.065
No, sir.

01:44:07.116 --> 01:44:10.200
Wake up, Captain, wake up.

01:44:27.261 --> 01:44:28.261
Captain.

01:44:32.558 --> 01:44:33.558
Wait.

01:44:35.352 --> 01:44:36.513
Don't.

01:44:39.899 --> 01:44:41.640
Don't.

01:44:41.650 --> 01:44:44.609
You said you'd protect me.

01:44:44.612 --> 01:44:45.648
You're my friend.

01:44:53.162 --> 01:44:58.157
It's me and you against the world.

01:46:31.677 --> 01:46:32.677
Help us!

01:46:35.639 --> 01:46:37.301
You have to help us!

01:46:52.281 --> 01:46:53.988
This is Private Perry Bernstein.

01:46:56.243 --> 01:46:58.781
Think about what you are about to do.

01:47:00.372 --> 01:47:01.372
Please.

01:47:02.082 --> 01:47:05.120
There's a little girl here
who might hold a cure.

01:47:07.755 --> 01:47:09.041
He's lying.

01:47:09.048 --> 01:47:10.664
They'll say anything.

01:47:10.674 --> 01:47:13.337
If they cross, they infection will spread.

01:47:13.344 --> 01:47:16.007
We can't let that happen!

01:47:16.013 --> 01:47:17.720
Keep your weapons raised.

01:47:17.723 --> 01:47:20.807
Open fire now and you will
have to live with that decision

01:47:20.809 --> 01:47:22.892
for the rest of your lives.

01:47:22.895 --> 01:47:24.852
There are families here.

01:47:25.898 --> 01:47:26.898
Children.

01:47:28.233 --> 01:47:30.316
I'm begging you.

01:47:30.319 --> 01:47:32.151
He's lying.

01:47:32.154 --> 01:47:33.941
You have your orders soldiers.

01:47:34.865 --> 01:47:36.356
Raynes needs to be found
and brought back in line.

01:47:36.367 --> 01:47:38.324
He may be the only hope of finding a cure.

01:47:38.327 --> 01:47:40.489
Trained you better than I thought.

01:47:40.496 --> 01:47:41.496
Open fire!

01:47:42.331 --> 01:47:43.788
What about the cure?

01:47:43.791 --> 01:47:44.952
There never was.

01:47:44.959 --> 01:47:48.543
I just hope it was worth it, Captain.

01:48:36.552 --> 01:48:38.919
We came here to find a cure

01:48:38.929 --> 01:48:40.966
and I am gonna complete mission.

01:48:40.973 --> 01:48:43.260
There is no cure.

01:48:43.267 --> 01:48:46.180
This is the
only cure that exists.

01:48:47.396 --> 01:48:48.978
I'm coming to get you.

01:48:48.981 --> 01:48:50.688
You got a lot of blood on your hands.

01:48:53.277 --> 01:48:55.735
Under no circumstances
is Captain Stanton

01:48:55.738 --> 01:48:58.151
or anyone else to get across that border.

01:49:30.439 --> 01:49:32.271
Everyone stand down.

01:49:42.201 --> 01:49:43.157
Everyone hold your fire.

01:49:43.160 --> 01:49:44.160
Stop it.

01:49:57.758 --> 01:49:58.758
Wait.

01:50:00.928 --> 01:50:03.386
I'll do it.

01:50:18.946 --> 01:50:20.278
It's my captain.

01:50:27.704 --> 01:50:29.445
Almost home, Captain.

01:50:35.587 --> 01:50:36.828
He has my parents.

01:50:36.839 --> 01:50:41.834
Captain, this way!

01:50:44.596 --> 01:50:45.427
Mission successful, Captain.

01:51:04.533 --> 01:51:07.446
