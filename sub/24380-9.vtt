WEBVTT

00:02.013 --> 00:04.409
Guess who landed
a coveted job offer.

00:04.410 --> 00:05.754
And it shoots in Iceland.

00:05.778 --> 00:08.757
This my suite,
my friends, my party.

00:08.781 --> 00:10.459
It's why you not comin' in.

00:10.483 --> 00:11.560
- I'm sorry. Seriously?
- Let's get outta here.

00:11.584 --> 00:12.661
Wanna take care of this?

00:12.685 --> 00:13.762
- She can walk on her own.
- Excuse me.

00:13.786 --> 00:16.465
- Thank you.
- You are not that strong.

00:16.489 --> 00:18.500
My mom, she served
six years in prison

00:18.524 --> 00:19.534
for killing her boyfriend.

00:19.558 --> 00:21.570
But the thing is,
she didn't do it. I did.

00:21.594 --> 00:23.572
I got a lead on an
unpublished novel.

00:23.596 --> 00:24.840
And there's a part
in there for you.

00:24.864 --> 00:26.575
What if I asked my dads
for the money

00:26.599 --> 00:28.477
to make your feature?
What do you think?

00:28.501 --> 00:30.512
- I can't do this right now.
- Why not?

00:30.536 --> 00:31.713
Because I have a boyfriend.

00:31.737 --> 00:32.781
So are you gonna tell him?

00:32.805 --> 00:34.816
I guess it's not so easy
to schedule an hour

00:34.840 --> 00:37.652
to tell your boyfriend
that you cheated on him.

00:37.676 --> 00:39.721
Shane, you are not well.

00:47.753 --> 00:50.432
'Would council present
please identify herself'

00:50.456 --> 00:51.800
'and state her intentions
for the record.'

00:51.824 --> 00:55.570
I'm Vivian Guetta, representing
the interest of Jordan Michaels.

00:55.594 --> 00:58.540
Will the deponent please
state his name for the record.

00:58.564 --> 01:01.443
My name is Jordan Michaels.

01:01.467 --> 01:03.612
Mr. Michaels, do you understand
that you're about to be deposed

01:03.636 --> 01:05.814
and what you say
will be on record?

01:05.838 --> 01:07.449
I do.

01:07.473 --> 01:08.784
And Mr. Michaels, do you swear
to tell the truth

01:08.808 --> 01:12.454
the whole truth,
nothing but the truth?

01:12.478 --> 01:13.588
I do.

01:13.612 --> 01:14.589
Did you kill Aiden Burn

01:14.613 --> 01:15.724
your mother's boyfriend on

01:15.748 --> 01:19.394
the 23rd of October,
in the year 2008?

01:19.418 --> 01:20.729
Well, he was beatin' my mom.

01:20.753 --> 01:22.464
I was scared, I hit him,
I didn't mean...

01:22.488 --> 01:23.865
Yes or no answers, Mr. Michaels.

01:23.889 --> 01:25.534
No, you don't understand.

01:25.558 --> 01:26.868
Mr. Michaels,
yes or no answers, please.

01:26.892 --> 01:29.471
You have an opportunity to share
your version of the events

01:29.495 --> 01:30.739
with the jury,
when you go to trial.

01:30.763 --> 01:31.773
Please, you're not
listening to me.

01:31.797 --> 01:33.875
No, you're not listening
to me, Mr. Michaels.

01:33.899 --> 01:35.844
Answer the question.

01:35.868 --> 01:37.935
Did you kill Aiden Burn?

01:42.541 --> 01:44.942
Yes. Yes, I killed him.

01:46.479 --> 01:52.232
sync and corrections by awaqeded
www.addic7ed.com

01:53.076 --> 01:55.054
You need ten different looks
for the press junket.

01:55.078 --> 01:56.155
I have your itinerary here

01:56.179 --> 01:58.357
it's pretty much back to back
meetings, interviews

01:58.381 --> 02:01.182
lunches, dinners, the entire
time that you're there.

02:01.951 --> 02:03.229
That sounds intense.

02:03.253 --> 02:04.964
These things usually are.

02:04.988 --> 02:07.166
It's a 48-hour press world wind.

02:07.190 --> 02:10.002
But, it'll help keep
your mind off everything.

02:10.026 --> 02:12.271
And, Rainer will be there
to help guide you through

02:12.295 --> 02:14.262
anything, if you
have any questions.

02:16.066 --> 02:17.109
Maybe overloading her
isn't the best thing

02:17.133 --> 02:18.210
right now,
she was just attacked.

02:18.234 --> 02:19.945
And this will help keep
her mind off things.

02:19.969 --> 02:21.947
Come on, she was attacked
less than 12 hours ago.

02:21.971 --> 02:25.384
- This is ridiculous!
- I completely understand.

02:25.408 --> 02:27.453
But, why don't we ask our girl?

02:27.477 --> 02:30.489
If you need more time,
I will cancel the tour.

02:30.513 --> 02:33.159
No problem.

02:33.183 --> 02:36.095
I just have to call
Gold Brothers ASAP

02:36.119 --> 02:37.163
because they're sending
a private jet

02:37.187 --> 02:39.187
after they found out
what happened.

02:45.161 --> 02:47.206
Ironically, the safest place
I'd feel right now

02:47.230 --> 02:49.463
is 30,000 feet above the ground.

02:54.437 --> 02:57.505
I know this trip was planned.
But please don't go.

03:00.810 --> 03:03.456
'Paige, will you
try this on for me?'

03:06.816 --> 03:09.303
I'm sorry. I, I just..

03:09.304 --> 03:11.470
I have to do this.

03:15.477 --> 03:18.311
Ugh, remind me to have
the locks changed.

03:19.380 --> 03:22.393
I had a feeling I would
regret giving you a key.

03:22.417 --> 03:25.029
What are you doing?

03:25.053 --> 03:27.231
It's not even ten
in the morning.

03:27.255 --> 03:29.066
And it's Tuesday.

03:29.090 --> 03:31.202
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
every day is Saturday

03:31.226 --> 03:33.170
when you're on hiatus.

03:33.194 --> 03:35.406
Plus, more drinking
equals less hangover.

03:35.430 --> 03:39.043
Well, you won't be
on hiatus much longer.

03:39.067 --> 03:40.444
'Cause I just got you season two

03:40.468 --> 03:42.213
of "Alexalicious".

03:42.237 --> 03:43.347
We start filming in two weeks.

03:43.371 --> 03:44.381
What?

03:44.405 --> 03:46.150
- Two weeks?
- Mm-hmm.

03:46.174 --> 03:49.053
That's not even e-enough time
to get over my last hangover.

03:49.077 --> 03:51.255
Let alone the one
I'm currently inducing.

03:51.279 --> 03:53.357
No, Ida, that's..
I can't do that.

03:53.381 --> 03:55.192
This will be happening

03:55.216 --> 03:58.229
and it'll be happening
to your bank account too.

03:58.253 --> 04:01.098
So, be grateful.
"Thank you, Ida."

04:01.122 --> 04:03.300
I haven't even had
a-a-any time to relax

04:03.324 --> 04:05.002
or get my life back on track.

04:05.026 --> 04:06.303
You gotta give me
more time than that.

04:06.327 --> 04:08.105
'Okay, these are
good problems to have.'

04:08.129 --> 04:11.375
You should be celebrating.
But not like this.

04:11.399 --> 04:14.378
Look, the network loves your
whole wild child antics

04:14.402 --> 04:18.249
but the drugs and the booze
have got to stop now!

04:18.273 --> 04:20.317
Or you'll be uninsurable.

04:20.341 --> 04:24.021
I caught your video of you
leavin' the Bixby last night.

04:24.045 --> 04:26.123
Tangey was so worried,
she called me.

04:26.147 --> 04:29.093
Not worried enough to stop Pablo
from kicking me out.

04:29.117 --> 04:30.327
Alexis, look.

04:30.351 --> 04:33.063
You got two whole weeks
to get your act together.

04:33.087 --> 04:34.164
No!

04:34.188 --> 04:37.067
This show has ruined my life.

04:37.091 --> 04:39.003
And now you're telling me
I have to go back in two weeks?

04:39.027 --> 04:41.272
No! Ida, it's not happening!

04:41.296 --> 04:43.173
Let me remind you

04:43.197 --> 04:44.441
that you are under contract

04:44.465 --> 04:46.443
and I am under contract.

04:46.467 --> 04:50.180
So if you quite,
the network will sue me

04:50.204 --> 04:52.538
and I will sue you.

04:54.342 --> 04:57.154
Pretty simple when you break it
down like that, huh?

04:57.178 --> 04:58.411
Now..

05:00.014 --> 05:02.181
...get your life
together, child.

05:08.089 --> 05:09.400
'Jordan, you have to understand'

05:09.424 --> 05:11.335
that now you're
in the legal system

05:11.359 --> 05:13.003
It's a completely
different world

05:13.027 --> 05:14.405
that plays by different rules.

05:14.429 --> 05:16.006
That is why you have me.

05:16.030 --> 05:17.441
But you have to listen to me.

05:17.465 --> 05:20.144
Okay. I'll listen. What's next?

05:20.168 --> 05:22.379
The DA will do a preliminary
hearing before a judge

05:22.403 --> 05:24.415
and he or she will determine
whether there's

05:24.439 --> 05:26.539
enough probable cause
to go to trial.

05:28.009 --> 05:29.987
Is there anything I can do
to help my case?

05:30.011 --> 05:32.022
Your mother Brandy,
was an eyewitness, correct?

05:32.046 --> 05:33.390
Yeah. She took the rap for it.

05:33.414 --> 05:34.992
Served six years.

05:35.016 --> 05:36.994
I haven't been able
to contact her.

05:37.018 --> 05:40.164
- Do you think you can?
- I'll try.

05:40.188 --> 05:42.433
If your mother corroborates
your self-defense story

05:42.457 --> 05:44.201
the judge may figure
that the DA won't have

05:44.225 --> 05:47.104
a strong enough case
to bring it to trial.

05:47.128 --> 05:49.139
The last time I spoke
to my mother

05:49.163 --> 05:52.343
was before she robbed me blind
and split to Tucson.

05:52.367 --> 05:55.346
- But I'll call her.
- Thank you.

05:55.370 --> 05:57.081
Get back to me.

05:57.105 --> 05:58.148
Thank you, Vivian.

06:00.000 --> 06:06.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:08.416 --> 06:10.027
Hey.

06:10.051 --> 06:11.362
I've been texting
and you haven't responded.

06:11.386 --> 06:14.231
What gives? I'm a millennial,
I need instant gratification.

06:14.255 --> 06:16.100
Have you been living
under a rock?

06:16.124 --> 06:17.301
Paige was attacked last night.

06:17.325 --> 06:19.303
- Oh, my God.
- By Shane.

06:19.327 --> 06:20.437
What?

06:20.461 --> 06:22.373
No.

06:22.397 --> 06:24.408
That is so crazy. What?

06:24.432 --> 06:26.343
He's been stalking her
for a while now..

06:26.367 --> 06:28.112
...apparently.

06:28.136 --> 06:29.313
There's been all these signs,
I just can't believe

06:29.337 --> 06:31.448
I haven't seen any of them.

06:31.472 --> 06:34.251
Shane did always
kinda creep me out.

06:34.275 --> 06:37.121
Good actor, intense creepy, but

06:37.145 --> 06:38.989
wow, that is so flippin' insane.

06:39.013 --> 06:40.190
How is she? Is she okay?

06:40.214 --> 06:42.126
Physically she's fine.

06:42.150 --> 06:44.061
And as okay as she
could be mentally.

06:44.085 --> 06:46.997
- I mean, how would you be?
- Freaked the 'F' out.

06:47.021 --> 06:48.432
So I guess this is probably

06:48.456 --> 06:51.101
the worst time to bring up
the producer we met.

06:51.125 --> 06:52.269
P.G. Carmichael.

06:52.293 --> 06:54.138
- He called.
- And what did he say?

06:54.162 --> 06:56.206
He wants to take
a meeting with us

06:56.230 --> 07:00.010
about "Stealing Georgia",
the feature.

07:00.034 --> 07:02.413
Yeah, um, that call was before
Shane went psycho

07:02.437 --> 07:05.015
and tried to kill Paige.

07:05.039 --> 07:08.185
Face it, Billy,
this project is cursed.

07:08.209 --> 07:11.121
Look, we can still pitch
Georgia to my dads.

07:11.145 --> 07:13.090
And if P.G Carmichael
comes aboard

07:13.114 --> 07:15.125
we'll be able to afford
recasting Shane

07:15.149 --> 07:17.294
and reshooting his scenes.

07:17.318 --> 07:20.364
And finish this for reals.

07:20.388 --> 07:23.367
Come on, Jake, we're this close.

07:23.391 --> 07:25.069
You don't give up, do you?

07:25.093 --> 07:27.137
Never!

07:27.161 --> 07:29.306
But we have to go to New York
to pitch it to my dads.

07:29.330 --> 07:31.041
They're happy to support me,
but they're not gonna

07:31.065 --> 07:33.210
take time off of work to do it.

07:33.234 --> 07:36.447
Paige will be in New York
for a press junket.

07:36.471 --> 07:38.148
After all that's happened
I-I should

07:38.172 --> 07:40.284
definitely be there with her.

07:40.308 --> 07:43.153
Yeah, totally.

07:43.177 --> 07:45.444
- Yeah, let's find flights.
- Okay.

07:46.481 --> 07:50.294
I just still can't believe
that it was Shane.

07:50.318 --> 07:53.297
Didn't you say you always had
a weird feeling about him?

07:53.321 --> 07:57.234
Yeah. But like "clip-your
toe-nails-in-public" weird.

07:57.258 --> 07:59.236
Not "stalker" weird.

07:59.260 --> 08:01.405
Parents, please,
stop calling me!

08:01.429 --> 08:04.063
I love you, but I'm fine.

08:05.266 --> 08:07.144
So, you..

08:07.168 --> 08:10.314
...still haven't told
Jake yet, have you?

08:10.338 --> 08:12.216
No, but..

08:12.240 --> 08:15.419
...Shane happened last night,
and then..

08:15.443 --> 08:18.288
I was giving police statements
all night.

08:18.312 --> 08:21.158
An-an-and Joanie came over
to prep me for the press junket.

08:21.182 --> 08:23.360
And, and then I-I-I had to...

08:23.384 --> 08:26.296
Hey, Paige, breathe.

08:26.320 --> 08:28.332
It's okay, just take
a deep breath.

08:31.192 --> 08:33.136
There just really hasn't been..

08:33.160 --> 08:35.405
...the right moment, you know.

08:35.429 --> 08:37.241
I'm gonna..

08:37.265 --> 08:39.409
...get this press junket
outta the way.

08:39.433 --> 08:41.979
And then when I get home..

08:42.003 --> 08:43.402
...I'll tell him.

08:51.279 --> 08:54.358
- Hello, hello.
- Paige!

08:54.382 --> 08:56.326
I can't believe you're here.

08:56.350 --> 08:57.361
Are you alright?

08:57.385 --> 08:59.263
Yes, I'm, I'm great.

08:59.287 --> 09:01.331
Why does everyone, uh,
keep asking me that?

09:01.355 --> 09:04.935
I'm being flown on a private jet

09:04.959 --> 09:07.938
to New York City with you.

09:07.962 --> 09:10.207
What could be better?

09:10.231 --> 09:14.411
Are we really the only one's
flying on this thing?

09:14.435 --> 09:16.313
We got it all to ourselves.

09:16.337 --> 09:19.349
- Wow.
- Go ahead, pick your seat.

09:20.408 --> 09:22.286
You know, we could
have the studio

09:22.310 --> 09:24.254
reschedule this trip
if you're not up to it.

09:24.278 --> 09:27.157
No. I-I-I'm fine.

09:27.181 --> 09:30.027
Plus this'll be good.

09:30.051 --> 09:32.329
Give me a chance to get
my mind off things, you know

09:32.353 --> 09:34.998
and talk about "Locked."
I'm excited.

09:35.022 --> 09:36.355
Madam.

09:37.425 --> 09:39.369
Don't mind if I do.

09:39.393 --> 09:43.162
And I'd love a mimosa,
minus the champagne, please.

09:45.199 --> 09:48.267
So, I heard you went
to a meeting recently.

09:49.370 --> 09:51.281
Uh, where'd you hear that?

09:51.305 --> 09:53.016
TMZ.

09:53.040 --> 09:56.286
And Jordan wanted me
to keep an eye on ya.

09:56.310 --> 09:58.222
Yep, well..

09:58.246 --> 09:59.356
...had a slip up.

09:59.380 --> 10:01.358
Not proud of it, but..

10:01.382 --> 10:04.061
...it happened.

10:04.085 --> 10:06.129
Well, you know
what I'm proud off?

10:06.153 --> 10:07.364
What?

10:07.388 --> 10:09.488
That you got back up again.

10:12.426 --> 10:14.304
If I leave now, I can catch
the red-eye.

10:14.328 --> 10:16.073
Are you sure that's
the best idea?

10:16.097 --> 10:17.407
She's gonna be back
in like two days.

10:17.431 --> 10:19.376
I should have been there
for her and I wasn't.

10:19.400 --> 10:21.411
But maybe you should
try calling her first.

10:21.435 --> 10:22.446
I mean, you don't even know
if she's gonna

10:22.470 --> 10:24.081
have time to see you.

10:24.105 --> 10:26.238
I tried calling her,
and she didn't pick up.

10:27.241 --> 10:30.220
Jake, I don't think that
you should go to New York.

10:30.244 --> 10:31.255
Why not?

10:31.279 --> 10:34.057
Because..

10:34.081 --> 10:35.425
Because you're gonna
take her out of her work.

10:35.449 --> 10:37.583
And she really needs
to focus right now.

10:39.287 --> 10:40.397
Billy and I are gonna
see her dads

10:40.421 --> 10:43.033
in New York for funding.

10:43.057 --> 10:45.357
We'll be there anyway and I can
make sure Paige is okay.

10:47.061 --> 10:48.293
Bye.

11:05.318 --> 11:07.363
- You okay?
- Yeah.

11:07.387 --> 11:09.231
Yeah, I'm fine, just..

11:09.255 --> 11:11.088
...bad dream.

11:15.028 --> 11:16.238
Do you wanna talk about it?

11:16.262 --> 11:18.229
No.

11:19.332 --> 11:22.144
What are you reading?

11:22.168 --> 11:23.979
A Western.

11:24.003 --> 11:26.237
An amazing Western actually.

11:29.242 --> 11:32.021
Ever since I was a kid, I..

11:32.045 --> 11:35.290
I always wanted
to play a role like this.

11:35.314 --> 11:36.992
Spaghetti Westerns
were my favorite.

11:37.016 --> 11:39.395
Ones with Clint Eastwood

11:39.419 --> 11:41.318
Lee Van Cleef especially.

11:43.122 --> 11:44.466
I've always wanted
to play a cowboy.

11:44.490 --> 11:46.068
What's stopping you?

11:46.092 --> 11:48.259
I mean, you can do anything
after "Locked", right?

11:50.096 --> 11:53.097
Or are you really quitting?

11:56.469 --> 11:58.280
All my life..

11:58.304 --> 12:00.404
...my mother's picked my roles.

12:02.175 --> 12:04.153
And I let her.

12:04.177 --> 12:05.954
'And then blamed her
for pushing me into things'

12:05.978 --> 12:08.123
I didn't want to do.

12:08.147 --> 12:11.393
This could be my first real
project on my own.

12:11.417 --> 12:17.299
Well, you gotta admit,
that's exciting.

12:28.101 --> 12:29.278
- Hello.
- 'Hey.'

12:29.302 --> 12:31.180
'How's everything goin'?'

12:31.204 --> 12:33.015
It's fine. I'm pretty nervous.

12:33.039 --> 12:34.283
You'll be great, just remember

12:34.307 --> 12:37.086
don't forget to mention
how much you love Tasha

12:37.110 --> 12:38.120
'and the book author.'

12:38.144 --> 12:41.023
Oh, and the studio asked
us not to talk about

12:41.047 --> 12:42.357
Jordan's current legal issues.

12:42.381 --> 12:43.459
'Leave that for
the gossip rags.'

12:43.483 --> 12:46.095
- Okay.
- And if asked about Alexis.

12:46.119 --> 12:47.996
The answer we're going with is..

12:48.020 --> 12:50.199
"Yeah her reality show antics
are a lot of fun."

12:50.223 --> 12:51.366
- You good?
- Mm-hmm, Mm-hmm.

12:51.390 --> 12:53.557
- 'Good luck, you'll do great.'
- Okay.

12:56.129 --> 12:57.272
- Hello. How are you?
- Hello, Paige.

12:57.296 --> 13:00.075
Good, good, have a seat.

13:00.099 --> 13:01.376
- Thank you.
- 'Here we go.'

13:01.400 --> 13:03.112
Alrighty.

13:03.136 --> 13:04.279
We good?

13:04.303 --> 13:06.014
Alright.

13:06.038 --> 13:08.951
So we're here with Rainer Devon
and Paige Townsen.

13:08.975 --> 13:11.086
Paige, rumor has it
that you and Rainer dated

13:11.110 --> 13:12.630
at the start of the film.
Is that true?

13:14.013 --> 13:15.124
Wow.

13:15.148 --> 13:18.427
You just dive right in, huh?

13:18.451 --> 13:21.230
Um, I don't wanna
disappoint all the fans, but..

13:21.254 --> 13:23.398
uh, n-no..

13:23.422 --> 13:27.102
- But we-we've grown so close.
- As friends.

13:27.126 --> 13:28.270
As friends.

13:38.471 --> 13:41.183
What was the most difficult
scene you shot together?

13:41.207 --> 13:43.051
Hmm.

13:43.075 --> 13:44.319
I would have to say, uh..

13:44.343 --> 13:47.089
when Noah comes back
from the war.

13:47.113 --> 13:49.458
When Noah comes back
from the war.

13:49.482 --> 13:51.460
Yeah, I'm gonna go with
Th-the scene where, Noah

13:51.484 --> 13:54.029
my character comes back
from the war.

13:54.053 --> 13:56.265
When Noah
comes back from the war.

13:56.289 --> 13:58.267
- What?
- Yeah, that scene.

13:58.291 --> 14:00.936
- Both of our favorites.
- What do you think of Alexis?

14:00.960 --> 14:04.406
Alexis' wild child antics
are really a lot of fun.

14:04.430 --> 14:08.010
It's no secret that
during the production of "Locked"

14:08.034 --> 14:09.411
I... just had some serious
issues I was dealing with.

14:09.435 --> 14:11.180
I have some auditions coming up.

14:11.204 --> 14:13.248
Paige, the man who attacked you
was in your boyfriend's

14:13.272 --> 14:16.084
short film "At Tin Creek,"
correct?

14:16.108 --> 14:17.119
Yes, that's correct.

14:17.143 --> 14:18.220
How do you feel
about Jake bringing

14:18.244 --> 14:21.356
a stalker into your life?

14:21.380 --> 14:24.226
Hey, we're here to talk
about "Locked."

14:24.250 --> 14:25.994
Let's keep it that way.

14:26.018 --> 14:28.263
I really don't feel comfortable
talking about it.

14:28.287 --> 14:30.432
Sorry, I just can't
comment on that.

14:30.456 --> 14:32.334
I can't comment on that. Sorry.

14:32.358 --> 14:33.368
I don't wanna talk about that.

14:33.392 --> 14:34.403
I don't really
wanna talk about it.

14:34.427 --> 14:36.071
I need a break.

14:48.207 --> 14:52.020
Hey, babe.
I'm so glad it's you, finally.

14:54.213 --> 14:56.146
Adam?

14:58.451 --> 15:00.229
Adam!

15:07.393 --> 15:10.094
'Please leave
a message after the beep.'

15:12.331 --> 15:15.010
I don't know
if you're in Tucson..

15:15.034 --> 15:17.212
...or Mexico..

15:17.236 --> 15:20.015
...or where you are.

15:20.039 --> 15:22.184
But I need you.

15:22.208 --> 15:25.187
I need you to do this for me.

15:25.211 --> 15:27.990
Please, mom? This is the fourth
time I've called.

15:28.014 --> 15:29.446
Please, pick up.

15:50.369 --> 15:52.336
You good?

15:53.039 --> 15:55.450
Yeah, just, uh..

15:55.474 --> 16:01.290
It's a lotta interviews.
It's really overwhelming.

16:01.314 --> 16:02.925
- What?
- Oh, my God!

16:02.949 --> 16:05.360
Jake took a red-eye out
last night.

16:05.384 --> 16:08.318
So his plane should've
landed by now.

16:11.023 --> 16:13.168
Yeah. It did.

16:21.246 --> 16:23.429
Hey. Sorry, I tried calling.

16:23.430 --> 16:24.440
But I couldn't
get a hold of you.

16:24.464 --> 16:26.242
So I got your itinerary
from Joanie.

16:26.266 --> 16:28.499
I just got your text.

16:29.436 --> 16:31.602
- Hi.
- Hey.

16:35.275 --> 16:37.253
I'm here raising money
for "Georgia."

16:37.277 --> 16:40.389
But I... figured I'd use
the opportunity to see you.

16:40.413 --> 16:42.391
Can we grab dinner?

16:42.415 --> 16:45.361
I just can't because I have
so many interviews left.

16:45.385 --> 16:48.064
But, you know, maybe tomorrow
we could, um..

16:48.088 --> 16:49.432
...m-m-meet up
s-s-sometime later

16:49.456 --> 16:52.401
if you just wanna just
text me your address.

16:52.425 --> 16:54.270
Uh, yeah.

16:54.294 --> 16:56.338
Totally. I, um..

16:56.362 --> 16:59.075
I guess I can stay with Billy
at her dads' place.

16:59.099 --> 17:01.043
Uh, they live here.

17:01.067 --> 17:02.466
Okay.

17:03.336 --> 17:05.414
Okay, well..

17:05.438 --> 17:08.150
Yeah, then just
text me the address.

17:08.174 --> 17:10.051
Or I could just stay
at your hotel

17:10.076 --> 17:11.319
and be waiting when you're done.

17:11.344 --> 17:13.388
I just don't know when
that's gonna be though.

17:13.413 --> 17:17.326
A-a-and I have to get up at
3 a.m. to be at a show by five.

17:17.349 --> 17:21.030
- And hair and makeup, you know.
- Yeah. I get it. It's all good.

17:21.054 --> 17:23.320
I better get back.

17:27.060 --> 17:29.371
Uh, when you're done, call me.

17:29.395 --> 17:31.307
Maybe we can plan something
for tomorrow.

17:31.331 --> 17:33.231
- Totally.
- Bye.

17:36.136 --> 17:37.980
Jake's not gonna hang?

17:38.004 --> 17:39.015
We've only got
a couple more interviews

17:39.039 --> 17:40.082
before we have a break.

17:40.106 --> 17:42.985
I know, I just need
to focus on work right now.

17:58.224 --> 17:59.969
Yay! You're here.

17:59.993 --> 18:02.138
Dads, I'd like you to meet,
Jake Salt.

18:02.162 --> 18:03.940
Director, producer Mr. Salt.

18:03.964 --> 18:06.108
So good to finally meet you.
I'm Andre Schwartz.

18:06.132 --> 18:07.910
This is Mr. Dwayne London.

18:07.934 --> 18:10.146
Esteemed New York film critic,
as you must know.

18:10.170 --> 18:11.314
Please, do come in.

18:11.338 --> 18:12.982
Thank you so much
for having me into your home.

18:13.006 --> 18:13.983
It's really nice. Thank you.

18:14.007 --> 18:15.284
Well, Andre does all
the styling.

18:15.308 --> 18:17.253
I'm the chef.
How are your knife skills?

18:17.277 --> 18:20.156
- Eh, uh, good. I guess.
- Excellent.

18:20.180 --> 18:21.991
Garlic and the parsley
need to be minced.

18:22.015 --> 18:24.193
- Red or white?
- Uh, red, please. Thank you.

18:24.217 --> 18:26.028
You won't get a lotta
rest around my dads.

18:26.052 --> 18:28.831
And when papa says mince,
he really means slices.

18:28.855 --> 18:30.266
So make sure you slice
the garlic real thin

18:30.290 --> 18:32.023
so you can almost
see through it.

18:34.127 --> 18:35.905
That's "Goodfellas."

18:35.929 --> 18:38.140
That's from "Goodfellas",
maybe I should be usin' a razor.

18:38.164 --> 18:41.243
Oh, well, you do
know your cinema, Mr. Salt.

18:41.267 --> 18:43.045
Welcome.

18:43.069 --> 18:44.246
Why don't you, uh,
tell us a little bit

18:44.270 --> 18:46.882
about your vision for
"Stealing Georgia?"

18:55.982 --> 18:58.094
Hey. Hey, buddy. Hey.

18:58.118 --> 19:00.118
Um..

19:01.287 --> 19:02.887
I'll take it from here.

19:16.836 --> 19:17.913
For the lady.

19:19.205 --> 19:23.085
So this is what you'd look
like as an everyday guy.

19:23.109 --> 19:25.254
At your service.

19:25.278 --> 19:28.124
Let me guess.
Bacon burger and fries?

19:28.148 --> 19:29.992
Actually, no.

19:30.016 --> 19:33.229
This time I went with
the tres tacos, El carbon.

19:33.253 --> 19:37.099
And beans, rice, and..

19:37.123 --> 19:39.290
Of course, you're always right.

19:41.261 --> 19:42.304
Fries.

19:42.328 --> 19:45.041
I've always loved that appetite.

19:49.969 --> 19:52.014
You're not gonna
eat alone in your room.

19:52.038 --> 19:54.016
I'm not gonna eat alone
in my room.

19:54.040 --> 19:55.251
Are we?

19:55.275 --> 19:57.375
Nah. That'd just being weird.

20:02.248 --> 20:04.115
So..

20:05.185 --> 20:08.197
...you said you wanted time
to think about..

20:08.221 --> 20:10.199
... "Redemption Ranch."
Have you?

20:10.223 --> 20:11.867
I'm still not sure.

20:11.891 --> 20:15.204
But why? You love it and Nina
has nothing to do with it.

20:15.228 --> 20:17.239
Look, that's just it.

20:17.263 --> 20:19.041
She's the one who wants me
to stay in the business

20:19.065 --> 20:21.110
and not quit.

20:21.134 --> 20:22.344
It's, like..

20:22.368 --> 20:26.082
I can't separate
my mom wanting things from me

20:26.106 --> 20:29.151
and... me wanting things
for myself.

20:29.175 --> 20:32.254
Well, you see what you're doing,
so stop doing it.

20:32.278 --> 20:34.190
Oh, is it that easy?

20:34.214 --> 20:36.125
Yeah, it is.

20:36.149 --> 20:38.060
When an amazing opportunity
comes your way

20:38.084 --> 20:39.895
you gotta go for it.

20:39.919 --> 20:42.364
I mean, that's why
I'm sitting here with you.

20:42.388 --> 20:45.034
'In New York City.'

20:45.058 --> 20:48.170
And is it all
that you dreamt off?

20:48.194 --> 20:52.108
I love the acting part, just..

20:52.132 --> 20:53.242
...the rest of it.

20:53.266 --> 20:55.945
'Everything that comes with it.'

20:55.969 --> 20:59.048
The way people expect things
from you.

20:59.072 --> 21:00.149
How it..

21:00.173 --> 21:02.940
...changes people around you.

21:07.313 --> 21:09.125
How did you do that?

21:09.149 --> 21:10.159
What?

21:10.183 --> 21:12.027
We're talking about me.

21:12.051 --> 21:14.318
When we're supposed to be
talking about you.

21:18.925 --> 21:21.036
I just wish there was a sign.

21:21.060 --> 21:22.338
You know?

21:22.362 --> 21:24.206
Something to tell me
that this is worth

21:24.230 --> 21:25.429
staying in Hollywood for.

21:48.021 --> 21:50.266
Jake?

21:50.290 --> 21:52.368
Billy?

21:52.392 --> 21:54.103
We got our funding.

21:54.127 --> 21:55.271
You're kidding.
They liked our pitch?

21:55.295 --> 21:57.173
They loved our pitch
and they think we should

21:57.197 --> 21:59.141
aim for Tribeca next year.

21:59.165 --> 22:01.877
Jake, this is what
we've been working towards.

22:01.901 --> 22:03.112
This is it, it's happening now.

22:03.136 --> 22:04.280
That-that's amazing. I-I..

22:04.304 --> 22:06.070
We just work so well together.

22:12.946 --> 22:15.257
I'm sorry. I'm-I'm so sorry.

22:15.281 --> 22:17.960
Uh, me too. I-I shouldn't have.

22:17.984 --> 22:19.962
Um... goodnight.

22:19.986 --> 22:23.054
- Yeah, goodnight.
- Yeah, sure, okay.

22:39.091 --> 22:41.024
Yeah, j-just, one minute.

22:48.100 --> 22:49.310
Paige, it's Rainer.

22:49.334 --> 22:52.013
'We're gonna be late
for Kelly and Ryan.'

22:52.037 --> 22:54.170
'Is everything okay?'

23:01.346 --> 23:03.324
- Hey.
- Ready?

23:03.348 --> 23:05.326
Yeah, I'm fine, I'm ready, um..

23:05.350 --> 23:08.151
Oh! My purse.

23:10.289 --> 23:13.056
Come on.

23:13.959 --> 23:15.258
We'll meet you downstairs.

23:26.104 --> 23:27.181
Paige..

23:27.205 --> 23:29.250
...what's wrong?

23:29.274 --> 23:32.287
Nothing, I just, um..

23:32.311 --> 23:34.889
I was having nightmares, so I
didn't really sleep last night.

23:34.913 --> 23:37.325
And I think I'm
a little nervous.

23:37.349 --> 23:40.061
'Cause of live TV, you know?
So my hands were shaking.

23:40.085 --> 23:42.252
And then I was, I..

23:43.288 --> 23:46.234
Why don't you let me
take Kelly and Ryan?

23:46.258 --> 23:48.324
Stay. Get some rest.

23:48.960 --> 23:51.039
Oh! Um..

23:51.063 --> 23:53.274
No, no, I..

23:53.298 --> 23:56.144
My, my mom really loves that
show an-an-and..

23:56.168 --> 23:57.845
I'm re.. I'm ready.

23:57.869 --> 23:58.880
I have to go.

23:58.904 --> 24:00.848
After what you've been through..

24:00.872 --> 24:03.406
...maybe live TV
isn't the best thing.

24:04.242 --> 24:05.320
Take the morning.

24:05.344 --> 24:09.123
And... we'll do the rest
of the interviews together.

24:09.147 --> 24:10.947
Okay?

24:11.249 --> 24:13.082
Thanks.

24:17.055 --> 24:19.167
So, now that you two
have secured your funding

24:19.191 --> 24:21.869
what's your plan for reshoots?

24:21.893 --> 24:23.304
Well, we'd have to recast Shane.

24:23.328 --> 24:24.939
- Obviously.
- Mm-hmm.

24:24.963 --> 24:26.207
With Billy's help
re-writing the script

24:26.231 --> 24:28.109
it's still dark,
but you understand

24:28.133 --> 24:29.911
Georgia's motivation
much better.

24:29.935 --> 24:32.046
We've been going deeper and
deeper into Georgia's character.

24:32.070 --> 24:33.114
Really finding her.

24:33.138 --> 24:35.183
It was all you, really.

24:35.207 --> 24:37.218
Oh, hey, let's grab this table.

24:37.242 --> 24:39.053
You going for Tribeca next year?

24:39.077 --> 24:40.888
Definitely Tribeca.

24:40.912 --> 24:43.224
Gives us a year to really take
our time and get what we want.

24:43.248 --> 24:46.060
Considering we know
what we want know.

24:46.084 --> 24:48.184
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

24:50.055 --> 24:53.134
Tall caramel macchiato,
grande almond milk latte

24:53.158 --> 24:55.291
and you Mr. Salt
are coming with me.

25:01.066 --> 25:03.177
So, should I name
this one, Director Jake?

25:03.201 --> 25:06.214
Dad, Jake and I
are just friends.

25:06.238 --> 25:08.116
- He has a girlfriend.
- Yeah.

25:08.140 --> 25:10.017
Well, you always bring
your business partners home

25:10.041 --> 25:12.019
as wannabe BFs.

25:12.043 --> 25:13.043
Do not.

25:14.980 --> 25:16.190
Do you remember the little boy

25:16.214 --> 25:18.159
with the lemonade stand
when you were six?

25:18.183 --> 25:20.027
Lemonade-Stand-Sam?

25:20.051 --> 25:21.162
And when you were 16

25:21.186 --> 25:23.898
the boy you dated that you
worked with at the yogurt shop

25:23.922 --> 25:25.233
Froyo-Ben.

25:25.257 --> 25:27.201
And then there was Mallrat-Matt.

25:27.225 --> 25:31.172
- Oh, Matt, he was so cute.
- So cute. Yeah.

25:31.196 --> 25:33.229
- And, then, there was Jeff.
- Ugh.

25:34.900 --> 25:37.333
But, dad, I swear this is
nothing like all of that.

25:38.303 --> 25:40.003
I promise.

25:40.305 --> 25:42.038
Okay.

25:46.278 --> 25:47.355
Alright, welcome back.

25:47.379 --> 25:49.257
Our next guest is
one of Hollywood's

25:49.281 --> 25:51.125
biggest stars and heartthrobs.

25:51.149 --> 25:53.995
'His latest project "Locked"
opens next month.'

25:54.019 --> 25:55.997
'Please welcome, Rainer Devon.'

26:13.004 --> 26:15.082
How you doing, bud? You good?

26:15.106 --> 26:17.018
Good to have you.

26:17.042 --> 26:18.286
- How are you?
- Great.

26:18.310 --> 26:19.287
- Yeah.
- Thanks for having me.

26:19.311 --> 26:20.922
I've got to tell you

26:20.946 --> 26:22.890
I always love
everything you wear.

26:22.914 --> 26:25.159
Your fashion choices are great.
Look at you.

26:25.183 --> 26:26.928
Thank you. Thank you. This..

26:26.952 --> 26:29.130
This is due in large part
to my, uh

26:29.154 --> 26:31.966
my stylist, Jose.

26:31.990 --> 26:34.335
He's been with me
ever since "Backsplash."

26:34.359 --> 26:36.971
- When things work, they work.
- 'That's right.'

26:36.995 --> 26:40.141
Speaking of working, now,
your co-star on "Locked"

26:40.165 --> 26:42.310
uh, Paige Townsen was planning
on being here today.

26:42.334 --> 26:43.978
I don't know
if you all know this.

26:44.002 --> 26:47.248
But she was, uh,
attacked by a, a stalker

26:47.272 --> 26:49.116
in her home, is that right?

26:49.140 --> 26:51.252
How's she doin'?
I can't even imagine

26:51.276 --> 26:52.954
'having going through
something like that.'

26:52.978 --> 26:54.288
So traumatic. How is she?

26:54.312 --> 26:58.159
Yeah, Paige is going to be okay.
Yeah. Um..

26:58.183 --> 27:02.096
She's still processing it all.
But she's tough.

27:02.120 --> 27:04.494
'Yeah, please tell her
that we're all thinking about her.'

27:04.495 --> 27:06.033
- 'Yes. Definitely I will.'
- Yeah, please.

27:06.057 --> 27:07.290
Thank you.

27:08.293 --> 27:09.871
Thank you.

27:09.895 --> 27:13.007
And, we, we saw a sneak peek
of "Locked"

27:13.031 --> 27:15.977
and I must say, it is great.
It's a great film.

27:16.001 --> 27:19.847
It's so romantic,
and you and Paige.

27:19.871 --> 27:21.983
Just the chemistry
between you two is amazing.

27:22.007 --> 27:23.918
- Really great.
- Thank you, thank you. Well..

27:23.942 --> 27:26.020
I'm really proud
of the work we did.

27:26.044 --> 27:28.890
And you've been quite active
in a non-profit

27:28.914 --> 27:31.225
cleanin' up, the, the beaches.
Trending Ocean.

27:31.249 --> 27:34.228
There have been rumors
that you may

27:34.252 --> 27:37.064
completely give up
the business and...

27:37.088 --> 27:38.900
Please say that's not true.

27:38.924 --> 27:40.234
You're not gonna
give up the business.

27:40.258 --> 27:43.871
Let's just say I'm choosing my
next step very carefully.

27:43.895 --> 27:47.141
So, you're not going to break

27:47.165 --> 27:49.210
millions of hearts?

27:49.234 --> 27:51.334
- Not today.
- 'Okay, alright. That's..'

27:53.071 --> 27:55.116
Then we're gonna get
all of the juicy details

27:55.140 --> 27:58.052
on the making of "Locked" when
we come back, so stick around.

28:05.183 --> 28:06.894
Hey, Vivian. What's up?

28:06.918 --> 28:10.031
'I have news and it's not good.'

28:10.055 --> 28:13.134
Let me guess.
Nobody can track down my mom.

28:13.158 --> 28:15.069
No, we couldn't.

28:15.093 --> 28:16.237
And without an eyewitness

28:16.261 --> 28:19.073
your claim of self-defense
is harder to prove.

28:19.097 --> 28:21.976
- Meaning?
- 'The DA went to Judge Cho.'

28:22.000 --> 28:25.880
'She's up for re-election and
tough on capital crimes.'

28:25.904 --> 28:27.248
'She'll be motivated
to find probable cause'

28:27.272 --> 28:28.916
to take you to trial.

28:28.940 --> 28:31.919
I mean, you're Jordan Wilder,
a movie star.

28:31.943 --> 28:34.989
It's a perfect opportunity
to use your celebrity

28:35.013 --> 28:36.857
to set an example.

28:36.881 --> 28:38.092
What are you saying?

28:38.116 --> 28:41.228
The indictment would be
second-degree murder.

28:41.252 --> 28:44.065
'I'm sorry to have to
say this, Jordan.'

28:44.089 --> 28:46.089
'But you should
get your affairs in order.'

28:48.960 --> 28:50.293
Oh..

28:51.930 --> 28:53.550
How much prison time
are we lookin' at?

28:55.100 --> 28:56.560
'Four to twenty.'

29:04.909 --> 29:08.255
Alex, it's Tange.

29:10.315 --> 29:11.959
Where's Alexis?

29:11.983 --> 29:14.228
I saw her on TMZ
assaulting the paparazzi.

29:14.252 --> 29:16.931
Yeah, I did too.
That's why I'm here.

29:16.955 --> 29:19.266
I finally got her to lie down.
She's resting.

29:19.290 --> 29:22.970
Resting? You mean, passed out,
don't you?

29:22.994 --> 29:24.171
'So she finally crashed out?'

29:24.195 --> 29:25.239
'What kind of uppers do you
have her on?

29:25.263 --> 29:27.842
Hey, hey.

29:27.866 --> 29:30.277
I'm the only guiding light
in Alexis' life.

29:30.301 --> 29:32.213
I'm the one keepin' her
career alive.

29:32.237 --> 29:34.281
No, you're the one
whose turning Alexis

29:34.305 --> 29:36.083
into a mental patient.

29:36.107 --> 29:37.852
You need to back off my friend.

29:37.876 --> 29:39.253
'You need to back up
here with all of that.'

29:39.277 --> 29:42.123
'Back up off of what? She's
going crazy. Did you see that... '

29:42.147 --> 29:44.125
'Keep your voice down.
She needs to sleep off'

29:44.149 --> 29:45.926
'whatever is going on with her.'

29:45.950 --> 29:47.261
'Whatever is going..
How do you not even care?'

29:47.285 --> 29:49.196
'I do care,
that's why I'm here.'

29:49.220 --> 29:51.899
'You see that I'm here and all
of a sudden you're involved?'

29:51.923 --> 29:53.034
'I'm, eh, always
gonna be involved.'

29:53.058 --> 29:54.135
'Doesn't matter
what we go through.'

29:54.159 --> 29:55.970
'She's my best friend, mom.'

29:55.994 --> 29:57.326
'What is she doing?'

30:01.407 --> 30:02.673
'Jordan, it's me.'

30:16.589 --> 30:18.400
Hi.

30:18.424 --> 30:20.569
Hi.

30:20.593 --> 30:23.293
Uh, I brought some
homemade tamales.

30:25.498 --> 30:26.730
That's nice of you.

30:27.566 --> 30:29.333
Come in.

30:35.441 --> 30:37.341
Uh, take a seat.

30:53.492 --> 30:55.426
I haven't heard from you
for a while.

30:57.196 --> 30:59.174
But I saw you on
"Good Morning America"

30:59.198 --> 31:01.231
and I am so proud of you.

31:01.567 --> 31:04.179
Yeah.

31:04.203 --> 31:06.637
You and a Chicago
District Attorney saw me.

31:09.642 --> 31:11.708
- Is everything okay?
- No.

31:12.611 --> 31:14.344
Everything is not okay.

31:17.616 --> 31:19.349
You know what?
Why are you even here?

31:20.186 --> 31:22.331
What do you want from me?

31:22.355 --> 31:25.233
I don't want anything.
I want to help you.

31:25.257 --> 31:27.436
- I want to be here for you.
- Help me?

31:27.460 --> 31:29.359
No, you don't. You wanna fix me.

31:30.629 --> 31:32.240
You wanna fix me, like,
I'm one of your

31:32.264 --> 31:34.309
little city block kids.

31:34.333 --> 31:36.378
And you were wrong, Marisol.

31:36.402 --> 31:39.381
Tellin' me the truth
will set me free?

31:39.405 --> 31:41.283
No, the truth got me
standin' in front of a judge

31:41.307 --> 31:44.219
who's gonna give me 20 to 30
with the possibility of parole

31:44.243 --> 31:46.376
if I'm lucky.
That's the reality.

31:47.380 --> 31:49.191
I know the legal process.

31:49.215 --> 31:50.559
There are still
plenty of steps to go.

31:50.583 --> 31:52.361
Check this out.

31:52.385 --> 31:53.562
Sixteen-year-old Cyntoia Brown

31:53.586 --> 31:55.464
is up for parole
when she's 69 years old

31:55.488 --> 31:58.288
for killing her rapist.
Her rapist.

31:59.325 --> 32:00.691
What are they gonna do to me?

32:02.228 --> 32:03.438
Outside of this Hollywood bubble

32:03.462 --> 32:05.462
I'm the guy the system
is rigged against.

32:07.633 --> 32:09.478
I'm sorry. You need help.

32:09.502 --> 32:11.513
But I'm not the person
to do that for you.

32:11.537 --> 32:13.615
You know what? I'm sorry, too.

32:13.639 --> 32:15.706
You were right all along.

32:16.475 --> 32:17.608
We are too different.

32:19.311 --> 32:20.711
Goodbye, Jordan.

32:41.600 --> 32:44.568
- 'What a day!'
- You said it.

32:46.305 --> 32:48.517
We have a few hours
before we take off.

32:48.541 --> 32:51.408
Let's grab a Gray's Papaya
hot dog before we go.

32:52.545 --> 32:54.456
I really need to talk to Jake.

32:54.480 --> 32:56.513
Do you mind if we stop by
the West Village?

32:58.584 --> 33:00.617
Avi? West Village.

33:25.444 --> 33:27.589
- Adam? Where are you?
- Hello.

33:27.613 --> 33:30.647
Oh, hi. Who are you?

33:31.584 --> 33:33.228
- Where's Adam?
- Oh.

33:33.252 --> 33:34.396
He had to run to set.

33:34.420 --> 33:36.364
But he wanted to make sure
someone answered

33:36.388 --> 33:37.365
when you called.

33:37.389 --> 33:39.501
Are you his girlfriend?

33:39.525 --> 33:42.637
Yeah. Hi, I'm Cassie.

33:42.661 --> 33:45.373
That's weird.
He let you answer his phone.

33:45.397 --> 33:49.311
Kathy, your boyfriend is
the cutest and he's so nice.

33:49.335 --> 33:52.314
I'm learning so much.
You must feel so lucky.

33:52.338 --> 33:54.216
Oh, shoot, you know what,
I spilt coffee

33:54.240 --> 33:56.306
all over my computer,
I'm so sorry I gotta go.

33:57.343 --> 33:59.254
Kathy?

34:14.260 --> 34:15.592
Thank you.

34:25.538 --> 34:29.451
- 'Hello.'
- Hi, um, it's Paige.

34:29.475 --> 34:31.620
Uh, is Jake there?

34:31.643 --> 34:35.290
'Hey, Paige. Uh, it's Billy.
Um, I'll buzz you up.'

34:35.313 --> 34:36.591
No, that, that's okay actually.

34:36.614 --> 34:39.494
Can you just, uh, uh,
send Jake down, please?

34:39.518 --> 34:42.364
'Uh, yeah, sure.
I'll, I'll send him down.'

34:42.388 --> 34:43.620
Thanks.

34:56.534 --> 34:59.269
Hey! Finally.
You wanna come in for a second?

35:00.272 --> 35:02.372
No. Can we, actually, uh, talk?

35:06.278 --> 35:07.678
Yeah, sure.

35:12.251 --> 35:13.550
Is everything okay?

35:19.291 --> 35:20.524
No.

35:24.463 --> 35:27.264
Paige, I've been meaning
to apologize about "Tin Creek."

35:28.367 --> 35:31.279
And I, I was a complete douche.

35:31.303 --> 35:33.281
I should've stood up
for you and I didn't

35:33.305 --> 35:35.372
and now I'm kicking
myself over it.

35:36.508 --> 35:38.486
And, I-I should have been there

35:38.510 --> 35:40.711
to protect you from Shane
and I wasn't.

35:42.181 --> 35:43.224
You mean so much to me

35:43.248 --> 35:44.492
and I-I know
you're not seeing that.

35:44.516 --> 35:46.416
Please, please, Jake, just..

35:50.589 --> 35:52.422
There's something
I have to tell you.

36:01.295 --> 36:03.273
Sure. What's going on?

36:03.297 --> 36:06.031
I'm sorry there's just,
there isn't, um..

36:07.268 --> 36:11.214
Hasn't been a good time
to tell you.

36:11.238 --> 36:13.038
Paige, you're scaring me. What?

36:14.275 --> 36:17.209
There's no easy way to say it,
so I guess I, um..

36:19.146 --> 36:22.214
...just have to... say it.

36:25.953 --> 36:27.352
You cheated on me?

36:28.055 --> 36:29.454
I'm sorry.

36:32.226 --> 36:34.271
I'm sorry.

36:34.295 --> 36:37.396
- With who, him?
- 'No, not Rainer.'

36:38.966 --> 36:41.111
Oh, my God.
I can't believe this.

36:41.135 --> 36:43.246
I-I saw it the whole time,
but I didn't think you'd...

36:43.270 --> 36:46.183
No, it wasn't Rainer.
Can you just let me explain?

36:46.207 --> 36:50.120
Yes, please explain.
I'm very interested.

36:50.144 --> 36:51.804
You have me on the edge
of my seat here.

36:53.113 --> 36:54.925
It was an old
high school boyfriend

36:54.949 --> 36:57.127
and it was right after
the first break

36:57.151 --> 36:59.229
and... I was scared.

36:59.253 --> 37:01.998
I didn't, I didn't even think
you cared.

37:02.022 --> 37:03.288
And I just felt..

37:04.925 --> 37:06.458
...so a-alone.

37:08.295 --> 37:10.062
It-it just..

37:11.332 --> 37:13.143
It happened.

37:13.167 --> 37:14.244
It didn't just happen.

37:14.268 --> 37:17.314
Paige, things like this
don't just happen.

37:17.338 --> 37:19.338
You don't think
I've been tempted?

37:22.176 --> 37:24.142
I could've cheated on you,
but I didn't.

37:26.313 --> 37:28.280
But you wanted to?

37:32.086 --> 37:34.152
With-with Billy?

37:36.023 --> 37:38.068
I mean, I've seen the chemistry
between you two.

37:38.092 --> 37:40.937
I, wait, so you have
feelings for her?

37:40.961 --> 37:42.239
Don't turn this around on me.

37:42.263 --> 37:44.140
I slept with someone.
It was sex.

37:44.164 --> 37:47.366
But it meant nothing.
But, you? I mean..

37:51.105 --> 37:53.338
Well, you're wrong.
It means something.

37:55.142 --> 37:58.076
- It means we're done.
- Jake? Stop, I can..

37:58.913 --> 38:00.145
You..

38:16.330 --> 38:18.096
Are you okay?

38:19.099 --> 38:21.166
I don't want to talk about it.

38:22.169 --> 38:23.947
Avi, please just drive.

38:40.020 --> 38:43.099
Hey. Hey, what are you
doing here?

38:43.123 --> 38:45.235
I had to see you.

38:45.259 --> 38:48.071
I'm sorry, J.
This isn't a good time.

38:48.095 --> 38:50.106
I can't help it.
I need to talk to you.

38:50.130 --> 38:53.432
Please just go, okay? He can't
see you here. I'm sorry.

38:54.301 --> 38:56.346
I'll call you, okay.

39:25.265 --> 39:27.377
What's wrong?

39:27.401 --> 39:29.946
Harper leaked to "Variety"

39:29.970 --> 39:32.190
that she's starring opposite me
in "Redemption Ridge."

39:33.307 --> 39:35.352
She knew I wanted
to leave the industry

39:35.376 --> 39:37.220
and she throws this
book property in my face

39:37.244 --> 39:38.221
and then puts out
a press release

39:38.245 --> 39:39.425
without even consulting me.

39:41.081 --> 39:44.194
She's using me
to get back into acting.

39:44.218 --> 39:46.251
Just like she used me
for Trending Ocean.

39:49.256 --> 39:52.124
This is just as manipulative
as my mother.

39:55.396 --> 39:58.363
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

40:00.000 --> 40:01.233
Me too.

40:03.070 --> 40:04.180
I trusted her.

40:11.345 --> 40:12.389
Rainer?

40:12.413 --> 40:14.246
I can't deal with these
manipulative people.

40:15.182 --> 40:16.682
Are you good
to go back on your own?

40:17.985 --> 40:20.096
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry.

40:51.051 --> 40:55.265
A CO28 seems very supportive.
Thanks, girl.

40:55.289 --> 40:57.967
And, um, oh, yes. Keep these
likes coming, you guys.

40:57.991 --> 40:59.102
I am loving this..

40:59.126 --> 41:02.072
Hey, darling. Get off the phone.

41:02.096 --> 41:03.940
I brought us some dinner.

41:03.964 --> 41:06.943
We got season two ideas
we need to discuss.

41:06.967 --> 41:09.379
And summer's coming
which means bobs are in.

41:09.403 --> 41:12.982
Okay, yes, this is not
a little bit shorter

41:13.006 --> 41:15.218
'than a bob.'
