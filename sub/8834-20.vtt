Baloo!

01:11.041 --> 01:12.417
I'm awake!
I'm awake!

01:12.500 --> 01:15.041
[Kit] I know it's been
three days without sleep,

01:15.125 --> 01:18.166
but we're almost home.
Can you hang in there?

01:18.250 --> 01:20.583
I could fly this baby in my sleep.

01:20.667 --> 01:23.750
[yawns]
Which is not a bad idea.

01:23.834 --> 01:25.166
I'm awake!

01:25.500 --> 01:28.333
Good.
Ease her down.

01:29.208 --> 01:32.417
[Baloo]
Beddy-bye, it won't be long now.

-[Mr. Khan] <i>Shipping report.</i>
-[man] <i>Yes, Mr. Khan.</i>

01:45.834 --> 01:49.250
<i>Your new tanker will be ready to ship</i>

01:49.333 --> 01:50.625

-[Mr. Khan] <i>Move it up to Wednesday.</i>
-[man] <i>As you wish.</i>

01:53.709 --> 01:54.750
[Mr. Khan] <i>Next.</i>

01:54.834 --> 01:55.750
[man 2] <i>Uh, yes, sir.</i>

01:55.834 --> 01:59.542

<i>Uh, why, yes, sir.</i>

02:04.333 --> 02:08.875
[Mr. Khan]
<i>Excellent. Raise the price 25 cents a tin.</i>

[Mr. Khan]
<i>Yes, but they'll pay anyway.</i>

-Jenkins.
-Hmm? Oh!

All coal-burning plants are up 14%.

Doesn't Mr. Khan ever sleep?

02:29.208 --> 02:31.375

-before the end of the month.

[man on intercom]
<i>Sir, you asked we alert you when the plane</i>

02:40.000 --> 02:41.542
<i>was nearing the danger zone.</i>

02:41.625 --> 02:43.542
Yes, indeed.

02:50.834 --> 02:52.875
Proceed, commander.

02:52.959 --> 02:55.625
Yesterday we lost
one of our transport planes

02:55.709 --> 02:58.542
on a secret cargo route, the Master Run.

02:58.625 --> 03:02.166
-Did it crash?
-No, it vanished.

03:03.291 --> 03:08.709
One moment the pilot was on the radio,
the next, he was gone.

03:08.792 --> 03:11.333
Tonight, another plane is making the run.

03:12.083 --> 03:16.291
Only this time we have
one of our gunships cruising the area.

03:16.917 --> 03:19.917
Khan Tower calling gunship.
Come in.

03:20.250 --> 03:23.208
[Hotspur]
Roger. Captain Hotspur here. Over.

03:23.291 --> 03:24.959
[commander]
<i>Have you picked up the plane?</i>

03:25.041 --> 03:26.458
Affirmative, sir.

03:26.542 --> 03:29.250
It flew over 10 minutes ago,
and we're tracking it.

03:29.333 --> 03:31.375
I'll relay the signal to your office.

03:31.458 --> 03:37.041
As you know, this system is still new,
and the plane's location is imprecise.

03:37.125 --> 03:38.917
Now watch.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.166
[beeping]

03:49.750 --> 03:52.458
[man] Curses!
It just disappeared!

03:52.542 --> 03:55.041
[all murmuring] Did you see that?

03:55.125 --> 03:58.625
Pirates? They haven't been seen
in this area for weeks.

03:58.709 --> 04:02.250
-Could it be magnetic disturbance?
-Uh, instrument failure?

04:02.333 --> 04:05.375
Quite frankly, we're completely baffled.

04:05.458 --> 04:10.041
So, gentlemen,
we have a mystery on our hands.

04:11.125 --> 04:14.500
I want to know exactly
what's happening and where.

04:14.667 --> 04:17.791
-Why not just send out another plane?
-Negative!

04:17.875 --> 04:21.834
I know my pilots and no one
will volunteer for a jinxed run.

04:22.250 --> 04:27.208
Hmm. Well, in that case,
we need to find a patsy.

04:27.583 --> 04:31.542
A chump... a flying fool.

04:31.792 --> 04:33.667
[thunder rumbles]

04:38.542 --> 04:42.458
What gives?
My eyes are open this time, honest.

04:42.542 --> 04:46.709
-Our lights are shot.
-Well, you're my navigator, Kit. Think!

04:48.333 --> 04:49.917
I've got it!

04:54.834 --> 04:56.834
That's using your headlights.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.125

Mountain, dead ahead!

[Kit] We did it!
There's Cape Suzette!

05:38.375 --> 05:41.417
Well, you got real nerve, Kit.

05:41.500 --> 05:43.250
Now, don't let it go to your head,

05:43.333 --> 05:46.583
but I think you're gonna be
a great pilot someday.

05:46.709 --> 05:51.125
-[Kit] As great as you?
-[Baloo] It is something to shoot for.

05:52.417 --> 05:57.000
Mrs. Cunningham, you and your crew
have saved our koala bear.

05:57.083 --> 06:01.917
I want you to know how grateful the zoo is
for these eucalyptus leaves.

06:02.000 --> 06:06.417
Well, we're just glad we can help
that poor, starving little animal.

06:06.500 --> 06:07.834
Isn't that right, Baloo?

06:07.917 --> 06:12.291
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Makes me feel all squishy inside.

I'm awake!

06:24.709 --> 06:26.792
Good morning, flyboy.

06:26.875 --> 06:30.625
Morning?
I don't want to see morning.

06:30.709 --> 06:33.542
-[Rebecca] You two are heroes.
-We are?

06:33.625 --> 06:36.125
[Rebecca]
For saving that koala.

06:36.542 --> 06:40.291
Oh, please, Rebecca,
can't I sleep just ten more hours?

06:40.375 --> 06:44.375
Rise and shine... and smile.

06:47.417 --> 06:51.917
Risked his life
for a bushel of leaves? The fool.

06:52.000 --> 06:56.458
Then again, he may be just
the sort of fool I need.

06:56.542 --> 06:59.458
[Rebecca]
See? My plan worked splendidly.

06:59.542 --> 07:02.625
Now, everyone in Cape Suzette
knows what a great service we offer.

07:02.709 --> 07:04.375
Let me see that!

07:06.333 --> 07:09.667
-It's a good picture.
-It's a stupid picture.

07:09.750 --> 07:13.583
No, it's a good picture
of you looking stupid. [laughing]

07:13.667 --> 07:16.834
At least you got your picture
in the paper. I never do.

07:16.917 --> 07:21.208
Never say never, kid.
They did print your name.

07:21.291 --> 07:24.542

our downtown deliveries on that?

08:45.208 --> 08:49.041
I couldn't find a regular bike,
so I put a motor on this one.

Snazzy, huh?

08:50.125 --> 08:53.667
Well, what do you say, hotshot?

11:01.542 --> 11:04.458
Say, aren't you that pilot from the paper?

11:04.542 --> 11:06.250
Well, uh, yeah.

11:06.333 --> 11:10.834
Hey, look!
First he saves a koala and now a baby!

11:10.917 --> 11:14.667
Oh, no, no. Wait a minute.
You got the wrong guy.

11:19.125 --> 11:20.625
[Baloo] Where's Kit?

11:20.834 --> 11:23.166
I don't know.
He stormed in here,

11:23.250 --> 11:26.417
threw his air foil in the corner,
and left.

11:26.500 --> 11:29.041
I'm worried about him, Baloo.

11:29.125 --> 11:31.375
I think I know where he is.

11:31.458 --> 11:33.375
Keep the bench warm, Becky.

[eagle cawing]

[stone hits the ground]

11:57.417 --> 12:00.125
Hey, buddy, you sore at me?

12:00.375 --> 12:02.875
No. But it's not fair.

12:02.959 --> 12:06.000
Ah, you mean all this publicity nonsense?

12:06.083 --> 12:09.458
Yeah. They cut me out of photos,
they misspell my name.

12:09.542 --> 12:14.917
-I fall off a building--
-And they give me all the credit, right?

12:16.291 --> 12:17.750
Right.

12:20.041 --> 12:22.041
Aw, now, listen to me, Kit.

12:22.125 --> 12:24.875
None of that fame stuff means anything.

12:24.959 --> 12:28.583
You know who you are,
and that's all that matters.

12:29.500 --> 12:30.667
Really?

12:31.375 --> 12:35.792
Hey, kid,
I think you're the best.

12:36.709 --> 12:38.375
Thanks, Papa Bear.

12:41.834 --> 12:44.166
[eagle cawing]

12:46.291 --> 12:49.458
Well, I'm glad you're OK now, Kit.

12:49.542 --> 12:50.792
Yeah, Baloo's right.

12:50.875 --> 12:53.500
You can't let
this fame stuff go to your head.

12:53.583 --> 12:55.875
I still say
it's a stupid-looking picture.

12:55.959 --> 12:57.667
[knocking on door]

12:58.917 --> 13:03.667
If that's Wildcat again,
I'm going to feed him that tricycle.

13:05.333 --> 13:09.917
Good day. I have a message
for Mr. Baloo from Mr. Khan.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.583
[all] Mr. Khan?

13:12.667 --> 13:16.750
"Your presence is requested
at your earliest convenience.

13:16.834 --> 13:20.375
Please see that your earliest
convenience is at 1:00."

13:20.458 --> 13:22.125
What could Khan want, Baloo?

13:22.208 --> 13:24.583
Sounds fishy, Baloo.

13:24.667 --> 13:28.250
Usually, Shere Khan's too high and mighty
to pay attention to the likes of us.

13:28.333 --> 13:32.542
-Shall we go? The limo awaits.
-Limo?

13:35.166 --> 13:37.542
After you, old boy.

13:37.625 --> 13:40.542
Then again, maybe this will be
good for business.

13:45.542 --> 13:49.959
Baloo Bear and Kit Cloudkicker
to see Mr. Khan.

13:50.041 --> 13:55.792
-Which one of you is Baloo?
-Read the papers, man. I am!

13:55.875 --> 14:01.250
-Then you can go up. The kid stays.
-Hey, we're a team.

14:01.333 --> 14:04.667
Yeah, well, this doesn't mention
any Cloudpicker.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.542
Cloudkicker!

14:06.625 --> 14:09.542
That's OK, Baloo.
I'll wait down here.

14:09.625 --> 14:13.625
-You sure, partner?
-Of course.

14:14.792 --> 14:17.667
Well, all right.
I won't be long.

14:23.792 --> 14:26.875
Oh, baby!
Where are the bleachers?

14:40.750 --> 14:44.166
Ah, Baloo.
A decided pleasure.

14:44.250 --> 14:46.333
Uh, ditto.

14:46.417 --> 14:50.959
Baloo, I want to add my thanks
to those of the community.

14:51.041 --> 14:56.125
-Hey! I can see the <i>Sea Duck from here!</i>
-Yes, I know.

14:56.333 --> 15:01.750
You showed tremendous nerve,
flying under adverse conditions.

15:01.834 --> 15:05.208
-Oh, well, actually--
-For such bravery,

15:05.291 --> 15:08.208
I hereby present you
with this gold trophy

15:08.291 --> 15:12.709
proclaiming you
the best pilot in the world.

15:12.792 --> 15:16.333
-Me?
-Come, come. You more than deserve it.

15:16.417 --> 15:19.250
Gee, maybe I do.

15:19.333 --> 15:24.625
And because you are the best,
I also have a special job for you,

15:24.709 --> 15:26.875
if you can handle it.

15:26.959 --> 15:30.875
If I can handle it? [chuckles]
Of course I can!

15:30.959 --> 15:34.458
-What is it?
-The Master Run.

15:34.542 --> 15:39.125
It's an ultra-secret cargo route.
And it's very demanding.

15:39.208 --> 15:40.792
Are you up to it?

15:40.875 --> 15:45.291
Hey, you're talking to the best pilot
in the world, right?

15:45.375 --> 15:48.500
[laughs]
Excellent.

15:51.291 --> 15:55.291
-Baloo. Hey, Baloo!
-Huh? Oh, Kit.

15:55.375 --> 15:58.333
Hey, cast your peepers on this, guy.

15:58.417 --> 16:00.625
"The best pilot in the world."

16:00.709 --> 16:03.417
You?
That's great!

16:03.500 --> 16:08.500
And guess who's going to fly
a special run for Khan? Me!

16:09.750 --> 16:12.417
Don't you mean... we?

16:17.250 --> 16:20.458
I knew the newspaper story
would be a good idea.

16:20.542 --> 16:24.750
But why would Khan want us?
He's got a million pilots of his own.

16:24.834 --> 16:27.375
Hey, he wanted the best.

16:27.458 --> 16:31.917
Why, after this run,
everyone will want me to fly for 'em.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.500
Oh, people will come for miles.

16:34.583 --> 16:38.417
Baloo for hire.
No job too big.

16:38.500 --> 16:40.417
No head too big.

16:41.417 --> 16:45.959
It may be your ego, buster,
but it's still my plane.

16:46.041 --> 16:48.250
Oh, right.

16:48.333 --> 16:50.291
-[banging]
-Easy, easy!

16:50.375 --> 16:54.750
This is, uh, valuable artwork, you know.
A... a painting.

16:55.250 --> 16:57.500
Must be an awful fat frame.

16:59.208 --> 17:00.750
Got to protect my cargo.

17:00.834 --> 17:05.040
-Kit, get the rope. It's behind the door.
-I know where the rope is.

17:05.709 --> 17:11.000
-Now, don't forget to buckle up, Kit.
-I know, I know! I've done this before!

17:11.791 --> 17:15.290
-So, where are we going?
-Sorry. That's top-secret.

17:15.375 --> 17:19.416
-But I'm your navigator, remember?
-Oh, uh, right.

17:31.959 --> 17:34.917
Best pilot.
[laughs]

17:35.417 --> 17:39.291
If only he knew
what lay in store for him.

17:39.959 --> 17:42.166
[upbeat music plays]

17:43.333 --> 17:47.125
I'll make sure they top off the tank, son.
I'm gonna need every drop.

17:55.709 --> 17:57.834
Hey, Baloo!

17:59.208 --> 18:02.667
Say, man, nice trophy.

18:02.834 --> 18:04.792
Oh, this little thing?

18:04.875 --> 18:09.458
It's just something I picked up
for being the best pilot in the world.

18:09.542 --> 18:14.125
-Ooh, what'd you do to get that?
-Not much, really.

18:14.208 --> 18:15.083
Oh.

18:16.750 --> 18:21.875
There I was, Louie, no sleep for days,
flying in a raging storm,

18:21.959 --> 18:24.625
when a lightning bolt hits the plane!
Crack!

18:24.709 --> 18:27.625
The lights go dead.
I can't see a thing.

18:27.709 --> 18:29.834
But my cargo must get through.

18:29.917 --> 18:33.583
So, I muster up all my strength,
grab the stick,

18:33.667 --> 18:37.208
and pull the wounded <i>Sea Duck</i>
left, right, left,

18:37.291 --> 18:41.542
past dangerous mountains,
until, by the seat of my pants,

18:41.625 --> 18:44.000
I managed to pilot her home,

18:44.125 --> 18:48.166
saving the poor koala in the nick of time.

18:48.291 --> 18:50.667
And all by himself, too.

18:50.750 --> 18:53.417
Oh, um, well, Kit was there,
too, of course.

18:53.500 --> 18:54.834
Well, of course.

18:56.500 --> 19:00.625
And now,
I'm on a special run for Mr. Khan.

19:00.709 --> 19:04.834
A mission... [chuckles] only a pilot
of my stature could handle.

19:04.917 --> 19:06.625
Really? What's that?

19:06.709 --> 19:12.417
Well, it's supposed to be a secret,
but it's the Master Run.

19:12.500 --> 19:13.625
[dishes break]

19:15.250 --> 19:18.166
Man, is this a dead party!

19:18.250 --> 19:21.000
Well, better the party than you, Baloo.

19:21.083 --> 19:24.375
Two planes have vanished
on that run this week.

19:24.458 --> 19:27.333
[Wily Paul on radio]
<i>Come in, Louie, this is Wily Paul.</i>

19:27.417 --> 19:29.667
<i>I'm approaching the Twin Spires.</i>

19:29.750 --> 19:31.834
<i>No sign of wreckage yet. Over.</i>

19:31.917 --> 19:35.375
Twin Spires?
We fly right through there.

19:35.458 --> 19:38.458
The two planes went down
somewhere around there.

19:38.542 --> 19:40.667
Wily's looking for salvage.

19:40.750 --> 19:42.834
Now, you be careful, Wily. Over.

19:42.917 --> 19:45.250
[Wily]
<i>Nothing but clear skies ahead.</i>

19:45.333 --> 19:49.375
-See!
-[Wily yells] <i>I... I can't see!</i>

19:49.458 --> 19:51.792
<i>There's something wrong</i>
<i>with my instruments.</i>

19:51.875 --> 19:54.834
<i>I'm upside-down.</i>
<i>Got to correct.</i>

19:54.917 --> 19:58.291
<i>No good!</i>
<i>Mayday! Mayday!</i>

19:58.375 --> 20:01.709
-Wily? Wily!
-What could've happened?

20:01.792 --> 20:03.709
It must've been pilot error.

20:03.792 --> 20:08.709
-No way, man. Wily's the best.
-I'm the best!

20:08.792 --> 20:11.291
Don't matter who's the best, Baloo.

20:11.375 --> 20:14.834
There's something out there
gobbling up airplanes.

20:14.917 --> 20:20.667
Could be a giant sea monster.
Could be a hole in the sky.

20:20.750 --> 20:24.375
All I know is, you go out there, baby,

20:24.500 --> 20:27.041
you don't come back.

20:28.542 --> 20:31.083
Baloo, maybe we should just
call off the run.

20:31.166 --> 20:34.583
Ix-nay, Kit.
You're making me look bad.

20:34.667 --> 20:39.375
Well, I'm off.
Danger or not, I've got a job to do.

20:40.834 --> 20:42.250
So long.

20:56.333 --> 20:59.875
[Kit] Well, that's where
Wily's plane went down, the Twin Spires.

21:00.542 --> 21:03.041
Baloo, maybe we should turn back.

21:03.125 --> 21:07.542
I mean, it's just you and me now.
You don't have to impress anyone.

21:07.625 --> 21:09.250
No one will think you're chicken.

21:09.333 --> 21:14.250
Chicken? Me? [scoffs]
In case you forgot, I'm the best, kiddo.

21:14.333 --> 21:17.125
Baloo! You're letting
that trophy go to your head.

21:17.208 --> 21:18.500
I am not.

21:18.583 --> 21:22.458
Kit, you and me used to be a great team
until you started losing your nerve.

21:22.542 --> 21:26.291
Now why don't you just check the cargo.
Now!

21:26.375 --> 21:28.083
I've got flying to do.

21:33.208 --> 21:35.792
Louie, this is Baloo. Over.

21:35.875 --> 21:38.750
[Louie]
<i>Baloo, hey, is everything cool, man?</i>

21:38.834 --> 21:41.709
Hey, don't worry about old Baloo.

21:41.792 --> 21:45.709
The master pilot
can handle the Master Run. I've--

21:46.583 --> 21:48.792
Baloo, is everything all right?

21:49.875 --> 21:54.041
I'm fine. I just...
Oh, no! I'm upside down!

21:54.125 --> 21:57.458
No, it's all right.
I'll just flip the plane.

21:57.542 --> 22:00.000
[Kit]
Baloo, we're not upside down!

22:00.291 --> 22:01.542
Whoa!

22:02.208 --> 22:05.625
That's better.
Now I'll just pull up a bit.

22:05.709 --> 22:10.500
-[Kit] No!
-Quiet, Kit! I know what I'm doing.

22:10.583 --> 22:11.500
[yells]

22:12.166 --> 22:16.166
Ooh, look at the flying fishies.
