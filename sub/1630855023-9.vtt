00:03.568 --> 00:06.354
<i>Grief is a terrible thing.</i>

00:06.354 --> 00:08.791
<i>When you've suffered
a loss as I have,</i>

00:08.791 --> 00:12.447
<i>the death of my mentor
and literary idol,
Brad Rayberry,</i>

00:13.622 --> 00:17.452
<i>time falls into
a slow, sad rhythm.</i>

00:17.452 --> 00:20.324
<i>And a moment feels
like an eternity.</i>

00:20.324 --> 00:22.109
<i>Even as the rest of the world</i>

00:22.109 --> 00:25.503
<i>continues to tick on.</i>

00:31.118 --> 00:33.816
You will
no longer be in
the River Vixens.

00:33.816 --> 00:38.821
Your mother and I believe
that it's too sexualized
an environment for you.

00:38.821 --> 00:43.478
High school in general
is a highly sexualized environment.

00:44.392 --> 00:45.697
Wouldn't you say?

00:45.697 --> 00:48.526
Is that how you see it?

00:48.526 --> 00:53.270
A bunch of horny teenagers
trapped together like sardines
for hours upon hours?

00:55.272 --> 00:57.231
How do you see it?

00:57.231 --> 01:01.148
As an academic institution
meant to provide
a safe environment

01:01.148 --> 01:04.194
where students can challenge
themselves intellectually

01:04.194 --> 01:08.111
without being morally
and physically compromised.

01:08.111 --> 01:11.593
Oh, well, you
obviously haven't spent
a lot of time in gym class.

01:13.116 --> 01:14.726
You are here, Betty,

01:14.726 --> 01:17.425
because you stripped in front
of your window

01:17.425 --> 01:19.601
for your next-door
neighbor's pleasurement.

01:19.601 --> 01:22.952
And then you flashed your...
Your underpants
on live television.

01:22.952 --> 01:29.393
In short, you seem...
unhealthily obsessed
with sexuality.

01:29.393 --> 01:31.439
Now, the words that
come to mind are

01:31.439 --> 01:37.445
"nymphomaniac,"
"exhibitionist,"
"sexual compulsive."

01:37.445 --> 01:40.796
What exactly do you
want to talk to me about,
Dr. Werthers?

01:40.796 --> 01:45.670
Well, given your
recent behavior, I'm curious.

01:45.670 --> 01:48.499
What is your first
sexual memory?

02:11.261 --> 02:13.220
I'm not sure that I remember.

02:14.221 --> 02:16.092
Uh, in that case, um...

02:16.092 --> 02:18.790
How often, Betty,
would you say that
you think about sex?

02:23.099 --> 02:29.671

<i>Betty. Betty.</i>

03:44.702 --> 03:48.010
How often do you
think about sex?

03:48.010 --> 03:50.621
I would say an average amount.

03:50.621 --> 03:52.493
I need a number, Betty.

03:53.972 --> 03:56.148
Well, according
to Dr. Kingsley,

03:56.148 --> 03:58.977
teenagers think about sex
every seven seconds.

03:58.977 --> 04:02.242
That number is
for teenage boys.

04:02.242 --> 04:06.246
There is a very different
barometer for teenage girls.

04:06.246 --> 04:09.901
Well, in that case,
I would say
I think about sex...

04:09.901 --> 04:10.989
all the time.

04:14.863 --> 04:16.256
What did you just write down?

04:16.256 --> 04:17.213
Never mind that.

04:19.346 --> 04:22.566
Why do you think you think
about sex all the time?

04:23.959 --> 04:28.485
I'm curious about...
how it feels.

04:28.485 --> 04:33.273
I don't think that waiting
until I'm married to
have sex makes sense.

04:33.273 --> 04:35.797
What about having
sex for pleasure?

04:35.797 --> 04:41.629
Betty, sex is for
married people so
they can start families.

04:41.629 --> 04:46.547
So then, what about the girlie
magazines that my dad keeps
hidden in his sock drawer?

04:48.636 --> 04:51.378
Uh, I'm sorry?

04:51.378 --> 04:55.164
Well, I remember last year,
we were going to church.

04:55.164 --> 04:58.950
<i>My dad asked me to fetch
him his cuff links and...</i>

04:58.950 --> 05:01.779
<i>when I went to look for them
in his sock drawer,</i>

05:01.779 --> 05:03.564
<i>I found all of these</i>

05:05.000 --> 05:06.654
<i>girlie magazines.</i>

05:22.670 --> 05:25.890
Your father is not in therapy.
You are.

05:25.890 --> 05:27.065
Well, maybe he should be.

05:27.065 --> 05:28.850
He's a grown man.

05:28.850 --> 05:30.460
I'm a child psychiatrist.

05:30.460 --> 05:33.333
I am not a child, either.

05:37.293 --> 05:39.339
Though, actually,
I do think that...

05:39.339 --> 05:43.343
our conversations
are starting to make me
see things more clearly.

05:43.343 --> 05:45.954
In what particular way?

05:47.259 --> 05:49.523
Well, I'm just now
realizing that...

05:51.394 --> 05:54.876
I don't think
I want to get married.

05:54.876 --> 05:57.531
At least not anytime soon.
Maybe never.

05:59.315 --> 06:05.147
I want to make an impact
on the world instead of...

06:05.147 --> 06:09.238
Or in addition to...
just having a family.

06:18.334 --> 06:21.468
<i>♪ Puppy love
That's what they say... ♪</i>

06:21.468 --> 06:22.730
Knock, knock.

06:22.730 --> 06:23.992
Hi, sweetheart.

06:23.992 --> 06:25.472
I got you something fun.

06:27.082 --> 06:29.345
What are those for?

06:29.345 --> 06:31.434
I was in the grocery store
and I just thought
the pictures were so pretty.

06:31.434 --> 06:32.957
I had to get you a few of them.

06:34.916 --> 06:36.700
Mom, I'm not even
dating anyone.

06:36.700 --> 06:39.007
Oh, it doesn't matter.

06:39.007 --> 06:41.836
A girl can daydream
about her wedding, can't she?

06:44.055 --> 06:46.101
Why are you bringing
this up right now?

06:46.101 --> 06:47.755
Oh, Elizabeth,

06:48.843 --> 06:51.062
I just know,

06:51.062 --> 06:55.589
when I see you in
that white dress,
standing at that altar...

07:00.681 --> 07:02.857
It's gonna be the
happiest day of my life.

07:13.302 --> 07:14.999
Tickets.

07:14.999 --> 07:17.741
Get your tickets
to the Babylonium's
James Dean double feature.

07:22.703 --> 07:24.879
What's all this
about James Dean?

07:24.879 --> 07:28.709
As president of his
fan club, I, along with
my fellow Dean-izens,

07:28.709 --> 07:31.407
have been waiting for
<i>East of Eden</i> to reach our
little hamlet for months now.

07:31.407 --> 07:33.365
Well, you're just in luck,

07:33.365 --> 07:36.760
because we have,
in our possession,
a print of <i>East of Eden.</i>

07:36.760 --> 07:39.328
And why, pray tell,
should I go to the Babylonium

07:39.328 --> 07:43.245
when the screen at
the Orpheum, in nearby
Greendale, is much larger,

07:43.245 --> 07:45.465
as befits the stature
of my beloved Jimmy Dean?

07:45.465 --> 07:49.425
Is the Orpheum giving
you and your Dean-izens
free passes?

07:49.425 --> 07:53.951
On the condition
that you spread the good
word about the Babylonium?

07:53.951 --> 07:56.171
We want a robust crowd
to honor Jimmy's memory.

07:56.171 --> 07:58.565
On the sacred ground
of James Dean's grave,

07:58.565 --> 08:02.917
I will deliver my fan club,
the Vixens and the Bulldogs.

08:02.917 --> 08:04.353
Excellent.

08:04.353 --> 08:06.007
But don't worry
about the Bulldogs.

08:06.007 --> 08:08.357
I'm extending that invitation
myself, personally.

08:11.882 --> 08:13.971
Batten down the hatches, boys,

08:13.971 --> 08:16.887
because the Babylonium
is going to do boffo
business this weekend.,.

08:16.887 --> 08:18.280
I can feel it.

08:18.280 --> 08:19.934
But why are we giving out
tickets for free?

08:19.934 --> 08:21.413
I'll let you in
on the dirty secret

08:21.413 --> 08:23.503
about the movie theater
business, Kevin.

08:23.503 --> 08:27.942
We make most of our money
from popcorn and soda sales.

08:27.942 --> 08:31.598
And, uh, what was
all that about
inviting the Bulldogs?

08:31.598 --> 08:34.688
They're our hometown
heroes. Of course
they have to be there.

08:34.688 --> 08:37.473
All the Bulldogs
or just one in particular?

08:43.348 --> 08:46.264
Oh,
check it out, Bulldogs.

08:46.264 --> 08:47.657
Oh, look at this.

08:47.657 --> 08:49.877
If it isn't
Miss Twinkle Town herself.

08:49.877 --> 08:52.096
It's Tinseltown.

08:52.096 --> 08:56.231
As a fan of the Bulldogs,
I wanted to personally
offer you free passes

08:56.231 --> 08:58.450
to our
James Dean double feature
at the Babylonium.

08:58.450 --> 09:00.540
Comp tickets
are in your lockers.

09:02.193 --> 09:04.631
And you, Reginald?

09:04.631 --> 09:07.068
Shall I save you
a seat beside me?

09:07.068 --> 09:10.375
I mean, surely you know
what Jimmy Dean used
to do in high school, I hope.

09:10.375 --> 09:11.681
What's that?

09:11.681 --> 09:13.378
He was
a basketball star, Reggie.

09:14.118 --> 09:15.729
Just like you.

09:23.998 --> 09:25.739
<i>♪ It happened ♪</i>

09:28.089 --> 09:29.177
Here you are.

09:29.177 --> 09:30.526
That'll be 25 cents.

09:31.092 --> 09:32.833
Okay.

09:32.833 --> 09:36.184
Or you could treat me
to a milkshake after the show.

09:36.184 --> 09:38.055
You just keep on shooting,
don't you?

09:38.055 --> 09:39.317
You keep passing me the ball.

09:40.667 --> 09:42.625
Okay, sure. Let's do it.

09:43.234 --> 09:45.149
Take it.

09:45.149 --> 09:47.064
- Meet you back here?
- All right.

09:47.064 --> 09:48.979
Now get in there
before you miss
the coming attractions.

09:53.462 --> 09:55.029
Veronica?

09:55.986 --> 09:58.162
Kevin.

09:58.162 --> 10:00.208
Guess who's got a date
with Reggie Mantle
tonight after the show?

10:00.208 --> 10:03.646
That's swell, but Clay's
got a situation in
the projection booth.

10:03.646 --> 10:07.868
I don't know what happened,
but the print we received
from the studio...

10:08.695 --> 10:10.174
We can't play it.

10:10.174 --> 10:12.046
What? Why?

10:12.046 --> 10:13.613
It's been overexposed.

10:18.139 --> 10:20.097
How many reels are like this?

10:20.097 --> 10:21.882
That's the thing, all of them.

10:21.882 --> 10:23.144
We've got a sold-out house.

10:39.029 --> 10:40.291
Welcome to the Babylonium.

10:43.381 --> 10:45.732
We're so excited to have
you all here tonight.

10:45.732 --> 10:48.865
So quit bashing our ears
and play the damn movie!

10:48.865 --> 10:52.260
Yeah!

10:52.260 --> 10:55.132
Due to some unforeseen
technical difficulties,

10:55.132 --> 10:58.788
I regret to inform you
we are unable to screen

10:58.788 --> 11:01.312
our James Dean
double feature tonight.

11:01.312 --> 11:02.662
I knew it.

11:04.011 --> 11:05.403
However...

11:05.403 --> 11:07.623
However, we are working
on the problem

11:07.623 --> 11:10.931
and are rescheduling
said double feature...

11:10.931 --> 11:13.150
That's all very well and good,

11:13.150 --> 11:16.937
but we, the proud members
of the James Dean Fan Club
Riverdale Chapter,

11:16.937 --> 11:18.982
demand a refund... immediately.

11:18.982 --> 11:20.854
Refund! Refund!

11:20.854 --> 11:22.682
Refund?

11:22.682 --> 11:25.510
You all got free passes,
including you, Cheryl.

11:25.510 --> 11:28.513
True, but we did spend
all this money on
popcorn and soda

11:28.513 --> 11:31.516
to consume during
the double feature
which is no longer happening.

11:34.824 --> 11:38.567
I would be more than
happy to provide each
and every one of you

11:38.567 --> 11:41.918
with a voucher for any
snack of your choosing...

11:41.918 --> 11:44.529
We don't want
your stupid vouchers.

11:44.529 --> 11:45.879
We want our money back.

11:45.879 --> 11:47.619
- Yeah!
- What a fakeout!

11:47.619 --> 11:50.622
It's like Jimmy Dean
died all over again!

11:50.622 --> 11:52.755
All right, all right,
all right, all right,
all right.

11:52.755 --> 11:55.366
Calm down. Calm down.

11:55.366 --> 12:00.110
You can present your receipts
at the concession stands
for a full refund.

12:00.110 --> 12:01.068
Yeah, right!

12:02.852 --> 12:03.723
Hey!

12:09.424 --> 12:10.251
Reggie.

12:12.209 --> 12:14.211
I'm so sorry.

12:14.211 --> 12:17.345
As much as I'd be
delighted to split
a milkshake with you...

12:17.345 --> 12:18.912
You've got a business
to take care of.

12:18.912 --> 12:20.870
I do.

12:20.870 --> 12:22.916
The Babylonium's hanging
on by the most
gossamer of threads.

12:24.308 --> 12:25.527
I figured as much.

12:27.572 --> 12:29.531
I'd happily take a rain check.

12:30.358 --> 12:33.361
Yeah? Sure.

12:33.361 --> 12:36.364
Yeah, just let me know
when's a good time for you.

12:38.192 --> 12:39.106
Okay.

12:45.199 --> 12:47.636
I've never heard of
such a thing, Mr. Roth.

12:47.636 --> 12:52.423
A venerated studio like yours,
sending out unplayable prints

12:52.423 --> 12:54.251
of a major release
like <i>East of Eden?</i>

12:54.251 --> 12:56.514
<i>I'm as baffled as you,
Miss Lodge.</i>

12:56.514 --> 13:00.780
At any rate, please accept
our deepest apologies
for this mishap.

13:00.780 --> 13:02.782
I'll accept your apology,

13:02.782 --> 13:06.002
but what I really want
is a pristine copy
of <i>East of Eden.</i>

13:06.002 --> 13:09.527
And what I want
is audiences in Riverdale
to see this picture.

13:09.527 --> 13:11.486
<i>I do. It's a wonderful picture.</i>

13:11.486 --> 13:14.445
But I'm afraid that there
are no more available prints.

13:14.445 --> 13:17.100
You sent me
a defective product.
How is this my problem?

13:17.100 --> 13:18.623
Miss Lodge.

13:18.623 --> 13:20.756
<i>Veronica.
May I call you Veronica?</i>

13:20.756 --> 13:22.584
You're the theater owner.

13:22.584 --> 13:24.412
It's always your problem.

13:24.412 --> 13:26.153
You'd know that
if you weren't so green.

13:26.153 --> 13:27.719
Green?

13:27.719 --> 13:29.373
Let me assure you--

13:29.373 --> 13:31.288
<i>I'm so sorry,
but I need to let you go.</i>

13:31.288 --> 13:35.031
I'm having lunch
at the Polo Lounge
with Monty Clift,

13:35.031 --> 13:36.076
but good luck to you.

13:38.861 --> 13:41.908
How does a major studio

13:41.908 --> 13:44.911
run out of prints
of their biggest
release of the year?

13:44.911 --> 13:46.956
I don't know.

13:46.956 --> 13:49.132
But luckily, they're not
the only studio in town.

13:51.700 --> 13:54.050
It's time to work
the phones, boys.

13:54.050 --> 13:55.269
I have Pasadena Pictures.

13:57.488 --> 14:00.840
Nikki? Veronica Lodge.

14:00.840 --> 14:03.059
No, Nikki, I'm in
exhibition these days.

14:03.059 --> 14:05.366
The Babylonium in Riverdale.

14:05.366 --> 14:09.109
Listen, my customers
simply don't have time
for that Steinbeck yawner.

14:09.109 --> 14:11.807
I need something exciting,
something fresh.

14:11.807 --> 14:15.289
Do you have
any available prints
of <i>To Catch a Thief?</i>

14:15.289 --> 14:18.031
I'm hearing great things
about Hitchcock's latest.

14:18.031 --> 14:21.469
Word around town
is that <i>Oklahoma!</i>
is a masterpiece.

14:21.469 --> 14:24.254
What about this
<i>Night of the Hunter</i>
I keep reading about?

14:24.254 --> 14:25.995
It's RKO.

14:25.995 --> 14:27.954
<i>Be that as it may be,
Miss Lodge,</i>

14:27.954 --> 14:30.478
<i>we've already booked
our picture
at the Orpheum.</i>

14:30.478 --> 14:33.655
<i>Unfortunately, Riverdale
isn't a market we're
interested in cultivating.</i>

14:33.655 --> 14:35.352
It's Silver Shield Studios.

14:35.352 --> 14:37.311
<i>I'm sorry,
but we're being very particular</i>

14:37.311 --> 14:38.225
<i>about how we're
distributing musicals
this year.</i>

14:39.661 --> 14:42.142
It's Superior.

14:42.142 --> 14:43.708
<i>Furthermore,
all of our current releases
demand larger theaters.</i>

14:43.708 --> 14:46.146
<i>Please, don't call us again.</i>

14:46.146 --> 14:49.976
But, sir, you used to send us
your movies every week.
What changed?

14:49.976 --> 14:52.892
<i>I don't do business with
underage would-be impresarios.</i>

14:52.892 --> 14:56.286
<i>Especially not when
I'm trying to get into
business with their parents.</i>

14:56.286 --> 14:59.289
<i>But good luck to you,
Miss Lodge. You'll need it.</i>

15:01.204 --> 15:04.033
Well,
there you have it, boys.

15:04.033 --> 15:08.298
I and the Babylonium have been
blacklisted by every
major studio in Hollywood.

15:08.298 --> 15:09.734
Why, though?

15:09.734 --> 15:12.172
If I had to
hazard a guess,

15:12.999 --> 15:14.652
my parents.

15:14.652 --> 15:16.524
I've been waiting
for this penny loafer to drop

15:16.524 --> 15:18.178
since I bought the theater
out from under them.

15:18.178 --> 15:20.484
My last call confirmed it,
but honestly,

15:20.484 --> 15:24.619
I suspected sabotage
from the moment
we got that bad print.

15:24.619 --> 15:27.013
What do your parents want?

15:27.013 --> 15:29.580
To see everyone
but themselves fail,

15:29.580 --> 15:31.800
including their own daughter.

15:31.800 --> 15:34.107
I'm sure they want
the Babylonium to shutter

15:34.107 --> 15:37.066
so they can buy it from me
at a discount
and turn it into a parking lot.

15:37.849 --> 15:39.764
I have an idea.

15:39.764 --> 15:42.942
So far, we've only tried
the major studios.

15:42.942 --> 15:46.554
But there are a lot of smaller,
independent places out there.

15:46.554 --> 15:49.470
They're scrappy,
and they don't play
by the same rules.

15:49.470 --> 15:52.168
Their movies
don't have big stars
or budgets or prestige.

15:52.168 --> 15:54.301
In other words,

15:54.301 --> 15:56.999
they're B movies,
but they're still movies.

15:58.131 --> 15:59.915
Good idea, Clay.

15:59.915 --> 16:02.439
Boys, if we're going down,
we're going down fighting.

16:04.789 --> 16:08.619
Get me...
one of those smaller studios.

16:13.450 --> 16:15.975
Tell me, Betty, do you ever
remember your dreams?

16:17.367 --> 16:19.152
Sometimes.

16:19.152 --> 16:20.762
Are your dreams sexual?

16:23.460 --> 16:24.548
Sometimes.

16:25.593 --> 16:28.378
Well then, tell me, Betty...

16:28.378 --> 16:31.512
What is your most vivid
or frequent sexual dream?

16:36.038 --> 16:39.128
<i>I guess
it's the one where
I'm in biology class, only...</i>

16:41.174 --> 16:44.394
<i>I'm the teacher,
tutoring one of my students.</i>

16:46.092 --> 16:47.310
<i>Which student?</i>

16:48.442 --> 16:49.312
<i>It varies.</i>

16:51.314 --> 16:56.058
<i>♪ Captured
In a moonlight
That blinds you ♪</i>

16:56.058 --> 16:59.453
<i>♪ And a magic
That binds me ♪</i>

16:59.453 --> 17:01.063
<i>♪ In a world... ♪</i>

17:01.063 --> 17:03.022
<i>Yes, but most often?</i>

17:04.023 --> 17:05.850
<i>It's Archie.</i>

17:05.850 --> 17:08.418
<i>And what occurs
in this dream?</i>

17:08.418 --> 17:12.335
<i>♪ A music strange to me ♪</i>

17:12.335 --> 17:15.208
<i>♪ Beats its thunder ♪</i>

17:15.208 --> 17:18.776
<i>♪ Through and through ♪</i>

17:18.776 --> 17:22.432
<i>♪ Is it love? ♪</i>

17:22.432 --> 17:27.002
<i>♪ This wondrous change in me ♪</i>

17:27.002 --> 17:32.573
<i>♪ This enchanted dream
Come true ♪</i>

17:34.966 --> 17:39.362
<i>♪ Captured
In this spell... ♪</i>

17:39.362 --> 17:41.799
<i>And that's
the part of the dream
where I realize...</i>

17:45.499 --> 17:47.153
<i>everyone's watching.</i>

17:52.114 --> 17:54.247
This dream,
and others like it,

17:54.247 --> 17:56.162
do you ever share them
with other people?

17:57.206 --> 17:58.816
No, never. Just my diary.

17:59.339 --> 18:00.122
Hmm.

18:01.993 --> 18:05.214
What are you always writing
in that notepad of yours?

18:05.214 --> 18:08.087
Notes, observations.

18:08.087 --> 18:10.828
Thoughts to myself,
kind of like a diary.

18:15.703 --> 18:16.660
Tell me, Betty.

18:19.359 --> 18:22.318
Where do you think
this urge comes from?

18:22.318 --> 18:26.540
The urge to be seen
in such a sexualized way.

18:26.540 --> 18:29.369
Well, it must titillate you,
make it more exciting for you.

18:32.894 --> 18:36.811
I don't think it's just
about being seen sexually.

18:40.075 --> 18:45.080
I think it might be more about
being seen... period.

18:45.776 --> 18:46.908
In what respect?

18:47.952 --> 18:51.434
Being seen... as a person.

18:53.088 --> 18:57.658
With autonomy, and desire...

18:59.355 --> 19:01.314
and self-determination.

19:03.185 --> 19:04.143
Go on.

19:06.536 --> 19:09.409
I'm wondering if my interest
in understanding sex

19:09.409 --> 19:12.542
is really more about
understanding myself.

19:14.849 --> 19:15.806
Who I am.

19:19.114 --> 19:21.290
I mean, what better way
to understand a person

19:21.290 --> 19:23.510
than to understand
their desires?

19:25.686 --> 19:26.687
Including your own.

19:29.211 --> 19:31.692
It'll just be
a few minutes.

19:31.692 --> 19:32.693
Thanks, Pop.

19:42.746 --> 19:45.619
Hey, Holden Caulfield.

19:45.619 --> 19:49.362
Have you ever heard
of a movie called
<i>The Crawling Eye?</i>

19:49.362 --> 19:52.191
Yeah. It came out
a couple years ago.

19:52.191 --> 19:55.368
Uh, the story
was kind of a mess,
but the monster was cool.

19:55.368 --> 19:56.369
I loved it.

19:57.892 --> 19:58.980
Mr. Rayberry loved it too.

20:00.416 --> 20:02.810
Why... Why do you ask?

20:02.810 --> 20:09.295
Because after calling
every minor independent
studio in La La Land,

20:09.295 --> 20:12.080
it's the only movie
I can get my hands on
to play at the Babylonium.

20:12.080 --> 20:15.997
Why don't you just do
what William Castle did?

20:17.738 --> 20:19.261
The name dimly rings a bell.

20:19.261 --> 20:22.308
He's a producer-director.
His movies are just okay,

20:22.308 --> 20:24.397
but they all came with
a kind of gimmick.

20:24.397 --> 20:27.226
Like for <i>The Tingler,</i>
filmed in Percepto,

20:27.226 --> 20:29.358
he put a bunch of buzzers
under the audience's seats

20:29.358 --> 20:32.100
and when the monster,
the Tingler,
appeared on screen,

20:32.100 --> 20:35.103
he would buzz
the people and give them
an electric shock.

20:35.103 --> 20:36.757
That sounds dangerous.

20:36.757 --> 20:38.628
It was just a mild shock,
but it worked.

20:38.628 --> 20:39.934
People went nuts
for <i>The Tingler.</i>

20:42.153 --> 20:44.112
I get it.

20:44.112 --> 20:46.462
Sell the gimmick,
not the movie.

20:49.030 --> 20:50.031
I can do that.

20:54.731 --> 20:56.733
Oh, good. She's home.

20:56.733 --> 20:59.170
Hello, dear.
So glad you're home.

21:02.696 --> 21:05.089
What's going on?

21:05.089 --> 21:09.833
You remember Reverend Lowe
from Riverdale First Reformed
Presbyterian Church?

21:09.833 --> 21:13.141
My, how you've grown
since the children's choir, Elizabeth.

21:14.490 --> 21:16.013
He's going to
hear your confession

21:16.013 --> 21:18.277
and perform an exorcism
if need be. Right?

21:21.105 --> 21:22.498
Confe...

21:22.498 --> 21:24.326
Confession.
Why would I need to confess?

21:26.372 --> 21:28.374
What are you doing
with my diaries? Uh...

21:30.419 --> 21:31.551
Did you read them?

21:32.508 --> 21:34.336
Elizabeth, I had to.

21:34.336 --> 21:35.468
They were prescribed to me.

21:36.599 --> 21:38.514
By Dr. Werthers?

21:38.514 --> 21:41.125
I would rather not say.

21:41.125 --> 21:44.346
You... You broke into my room
and stole my diaries

21:44.346 --> 21:47.654
because my psychiatrist
told you to?

21:47.654 --> 21:50.134
Good grief, Mother!

21:50.134 --> 21:54.487
I suspected you and Dr. Psycho
were talking about me,
but breaking and entering?

21:54.487 --> 21:57.707
If you are so hot to trot
to talk with Dr. Werthers,

21:57.707 --> 22:00.667
why don't you come
to therapy with me?
It might help you.

22:00.667 --> 22:04.627
I am an adult woman.
I don't need therapy.

22:07.282 --> 22:09.066
Elizabeth. Elizabeth.

22:11.460 --> 22:13.157
Breaking and entering.

22:13.157 --> 22:15.856
<i>What do you write down
in that notepad of yours?</i>

22:15.856 --> 22:17.118
Breaking and entering.

22:30.218 --> 22:32.481
Okay. Dr. Werthers.

22:32.481 --> 22:34.483
Let's see what you've been
writing about me.

22:54.721 --> 22:56.070
Come on.

22:56.070 --> 22:58.377
This always works
in the Tracy True books.

23:30.147 --> 23:34.978
Gosh. You're an even
bigger bookworm than I am.

23:34.978 --> 23:39.200
Pop says you've been glued
to this booth for two days,
getting ink on your nose.

23:39.200 --> 23:41.942
Uh, yeah, you might say,
I'm, um...

23:41.942 --> 23:44.727
spending time with a friend
before saying goodbye.

23:44.727 --> 23:48.688
Oh, well,
sorry to interrupt, but...

23:48.688 --> 23:50.820
have you heard
of this book, <i>Lolita?</i>

23:51.821 --> 23:53.040
Holy moly.

23:54.128 --> 23:55.608
Where did you get this?

23:55.608 --> 23:58.132
I borrowed it from a friend.

23:58.132 --> 23:59.612
What can you tell me about it?

23:59.612 --> 24:02.397
Well, it's Nabokov's
latest novel.

24:02.397 --> 24:05.052
It's... pretty salacious,

24:05.052 --> 24:06.967
according to the <i>Paris Review.</i>

24:06.967 --> 24:09.012
It's about a relationship

24:09.012 --> 24:10.710
between a professor
named Humbert Humbert

24:10.710 --> 24:14.104
and a young girl
named Dolores Haze.

24:14.104 --> 24:16.063
- How young?
- Twelve.

24:16.063 --> 24:17.586
Twelve?

24:17.586 --> 24:19.109
So it's a book for perverts?

24:19.109 --> 24:21.068
Well...

24:21.068 --> 24:23.331
passing moral judgment
on a work of art
is a slippery slope.

24:25.289 --> 24:27.161
Have you read it yet?

24:27.161 --> 24:29.816
That's what I'm about to go do.
Thank you, Jughead.

24:35.996 --> 24:38.433
- Hey, Pop, can I get
another one, please?
- Coming right up.

25:03.110 --> 25:05.808
<i>No one is safe from its spell
of destruction.</i>

25:05.808 --> 25:10.291
<i>A cold, hypnotic stare
striking fear into
the hearts of all,</i>

25:10.291 --> 25:13.729
<i>creating a frenzied nightmare
for those who behold it.</i>

25:16.471 --> 25:21.737
And that, ladies and germs,
is the terrifying, titillating
new feature film,

25:21.737 --> 25:26.568
<i>The Crawling Eye,</i>
playing at the Babylonium,
one week only.

25:26.568 --> 25:28.962
Not that I care to see
such dreck,

25:28.962 --> 25:32.269
but didn't that movie
come out a few years ago?

25:32.269 --> 25:36.317
Perhaps,
but this is a re-release
in stunning 4D.

25:36.317 --> 25:38.537
Mmm, don't you mean 3D?

25:38.537 --> 25:43.890
Oh, no. 3D is so 1952.
This is 4D, Cheryl,

25:43.890 --> 25:45.848
a new fourth
dimension of terror.

25:46.936 --> 25:48.938
Time is the fourth dimension.

25:48.938 --> 25:49.852
Do you mean time?

25:50.810 --> 25:52.855
Shut up, Dilton.

25:52.855 --> 25:56.467
4D is a novel,
visceral experience,

25:56.467 --> 25:58.426
unlike anything
you've ever encountered

25:58.426 --> 26:00.689
at the movies before. Guaranteed.

26:00.689 --> 26:04.475
My associates are handing out
little novelty reminders,

26:04.475 --> 26:06.782
which are redeemable
at the candy counter,

26:06.782 --> 26:08.915
for buy-one-get-one-free
Milk Buds.

26:11.395 --> 26:14.660
Now, remember, boys.
After you completely
cover your balls

26:14.660 --> 26:16.575
with a layer of newspaper,

26:16.575 --> 26:19.099
let them dry before
applying the next one.

26:19.099 --> 26:21.362
I'll handle the paint job
when I get back from casting.

26:21.362 --> 26:23.190
<i>♪ When the record
Starts to boop ♪</i>

26:23.190 --> 26:25.148
<i>♪ And your body starts to move
Shake around, girl ♪</i>

26:27.629 --> 26:29.762
<i>♪ And the cats
All start to stew

26:29.762 --> 26:33.461
Just the two strapping he-men
I've been looking for
all my life.

26:33.461 --> 26:35.811
Hope you can make it
to <i>The Crawling Eye</i> tonight.

26:35.811 --> 26:39.772
Not as audience members,
mind you, but as performers.

26:39.772 --> 26:43.297
As part of my revolutionary
4D experience.

26:43.297 --> 26:45.821
- Veronica, we're not actors.
- What would we have to do?

26:47.780 --> 26:48.911
Yeah, what exactly?

26:48.911 --> 26:50.783
Not much.

26:50.783 --> 26:53.960
All told, it would probably be
about two minutes of work,

26:53.960 --> 26:57.093
for which you'd be
handsomely compensated,
of course.

27:00.401 --> 27:02.795
<i>♪ When you get up

27:02.795 --> 27:04.405

27:04.405 --> 27:06.407
Oh, Miss Cooper.

27:06.407 --> 27:08.757
You haven't forgotten about
our standing appointment,
have you?

27:08.757 --> 27:10.193
No, I didn't.

27:10.193 --> 27:12.631
But I won't be attending
our session today.

27:12.631 --> 27:15.242
Instead, I have some very
interesting reading
to finish tonight.

27:15.242 --> 27:16.852
But don't worry, Doctor.

27:16.852 --> 27:20.334
I'm sure tomorrow
we will have plenty to discuss.

27:20.334 --> 27:22.815
<i>♪ Move little baby ♪</i>

27:22.815 --> 27:25.252
<i>♪ Can you kick around
Little baby ♪</i>

27:25.252 --> 27:27.994
<i>♪ You gotta slow it down
Little baby ♪</i>

27:27.994 --> 27:30.474
<i>♪ 'Cause when the record
Starts a-groovin'

27:30.474 --> 27:33.434
Cheryl.
So glad you could make it.

27:33.434 --> 27:36.655
Before the movie,
you may want to take out
a life insurance policy.

27:36.655 --> 27:38.874
You know, in case
you die of fright.

27:39.745 --> 27:41.485
Pathetic.

27:41.485 --> 27:44.837
Otherwise we have
a nurse on duty,
should you merely faint.

27:48.144 --> 27:50.190
I am extremely
disappointed in you, Midge.

27:52.627 --> 27:56.022
Now, let's see what
this 4D you've been
ballyhooing is all about.

27:56.022 --> 27:58.372
And believe me,
if it disappoints,

27:58.372 --> 28:01.505
I will be demanding
a refund, again.

28:01.505 --> 28:04.334
<i>♪ And when the record

28:04.334 --> 28:06.423
<i>♪ Shake around, girl ♪</i>

28:10.427 --> 28:12.168
<i>take the car up.

28:12.168 --> 28:13.474
- <i>What about you?</i>
- <i>Do as you're told.</i>

28:51.642 --> 28:54.776
<i>Steady. Steady.</i>

28:54.776 --> 28:56.517
<i>To your right.</i>

28:56.517 --> 28:58.345
<i>Visual on. Steady.</i>

28:59.912 --> 29:00.826
<i>Bombs away!</i>

29:17.930 --> 29:20.323

29:22.238 --> 29:24.763

29:52.965 --> 29:58.144
You care to explain
this novel, Dr. Werthers,
which I found in your desk?

29:58.144 --> 30:00.624
Breaking into my office,
stealing my property.

30:00.624 --> 30:01.930
So you admit it's yours?

30:01.930 --> 30:04.193
Of course it's mine.

30:04.193 --> 30:09.677
By reading about <i>Lolita's</i> mind,
I was hoping to better
understand yours, Betty.

30:09.677 --> 30:11.331
You're comparing me

30:12.158 --> 30:13.681
to <i>Lolita.</i>

30:13.681 --> 30:17.032
Well, she, too,
is a sex-crazed young woman.

30:17.032 --> 30:22.995
Dolores Haze is
a 12-year-old girl,
and she is not sex-crazed.

30:22.995 --> 30:28.391
She is being coerced
against her will,
much like I am, Doctor.

30:28.391 --> 30:32.613
So let me tell you
what I learned
from reading <i>Lolita.</i>

30:32.613 --> 30:37.487
You are a kissing cousin
to Humbert Humbert,
only creepier.

30:37.487 --> 30:41.448
And it is completely
inappropriate for you to be
asking me all these questions

30:41.448 --> 30:47.280
about my sexual fantasies
and experiences
behind closed doors.

30:47.280 --> 30:51.545
Manipulating our conversation,
feverishly writing down
every word that I say.

30:51.545 --> 30:54.678
Doing God knows what
with that notebook
of yours at night.

30:54.678 --> 30:56.550
You think I'm
obsessed with sex?

30:56.550 --> 31:00.336
I think you're the one
who's obsessed
with sex, Doctor.

31:00.336 --> 31:02.208
Dangerously so.

31:02.208 --> 31:04.732
And I don't think you're
reading <i>Lolita</i> for research.

31:04.732 --> 31:09.084
I think you're
reading it for pleasure
and some sick gratification,

31:09.084 --> 31:12.044
and I no longer feel
comfortable being alone
in a room with you.

31:31.585 --> 31:32.673
Excuse me.

31:36.329 --> 31:38.113
Guess word got out, huh?

31:38.113 --> 31:40.507
I'll say.
Our seven o'clock show
is already sold out.

31:42.291 --> 31:45.207
Well, boys, we've got
a genuine hit on our hands.

31:45.207 --> 31:47.340
Ready to play
to a full house tonight?

31:47.340 --> 31:49.516
That's what we
wanted to talk about.

31:49.516 --> 31:53.389
Veronica, we did this
as a personal favor
to you, and...

31:53.389 --> 31:56.262
We were happy to, once.

31:56.262 --> 31:58.481
But this can't be a...
A regular thing.

31:58.481 --> 32:00.657
I'll say this.

32:00.657 --> 32:04.096
You two sure know
when to ask for a raise.

32:04.096 --> 32:06.620
Because I respect your moxie
and your balls,

32:08.013 --> 32:10.363
I'll pay you $2 per show
going forward.

32:10.363 --> 32:14.019
Veronica, we can't do it, okay?
We have basketball practice.
We have games.

32:14.019 --> 32:17.718
Seems to me
like you're playing hardball,
not basketball.

32:17.718 --> 32:20.503
But here's the thing.
You're not the stars.

32:20.503 --> 32:22.592
Those eyeballs are the stars.

32:22.592 --> 32:24.943
You want to squeeze me,
I'm not interested.

32:24.943 --> 32:27.423
I'll get Kevin and Clay
to do the gag. You can leave
your balls with them.

32:37.129 --> 32:38.478
Yes, Reginald?

32:38.478 --> 32:40.349
I was thinking...

32:40.349 --> 32:43.570
Maybe after tonight's show,
we can try that date again?

32:44.963 --> 32:47.356
I would, but...

32:47.356 --> 32:49.315
did you see that
crowd out there?

32:49.315 --> 32:50.925
I have to get on
the phone with <i>Variety</i>

32:50.925 --> 32:53.275
and whip this buzz
into a story.

32:53.275 --> 32:56.235
<i>The Crawling Eye</i> is going
to change everything
for the Babylonium.

32:56.975 --> 32:57.932
Yeah.

32:59.455 --> 33:01.457
But I'll tell you what.

33:01.457 --> 33:03.677
Come by tomorrow,
and we'll see.

33:04.634 --> 33:05.505
Okay.

33:08.812 --> 33:11.511
Well, I think I've heard
just about everything now.

33:11.511 --> 33:13.034
Just got off the phone
with Dr. Werthers,

33:13.034 --> 33:15.036
and he wants to end
his sessions with you.

33:16.690 --> 33:18.735
Great.
The feeling's mutual.

33:18.735 --> 33:22.043
To which I told him,
under no circumstances
is he to give up on you.

33:22.043 --> 33:24.350
Mom... Why?

33:24.350 --> 33:26.874
Because he's going to fix you.

33:26.874 --> 33:29.007
Whatever... Whatever
is wrong with you,

33:29.007 --> 33:31.574
he is going to help me fix it.

33:31.574 --> 33:35.056
There is nothing wrong with me.
I wish you would stop trying
to convince me otherwise.

33:38.016 --> 33:40.670
- Who are you calling?
- Dr. Werthers.
I'm calling him back.

33:40.670 --> 33:42.672
Put the phone down.

33:42.672 --> 33:45.588
If you want to help me,
then talk to me.
Really, just talk to me.

33:45.588 --> 33:49.157
Stop playing this stupid game
of telephone with Dr. Werthers.

33:50.071 --> 33:51.638
Fine.

33:51.638 --> 33:53.596
What would you like
to talk about, young lady?

33:53.596 --> 33:54.554
Everything.

33:57.731 --> 34:00.603
Starting with how unhappy
I think you are.

34:03.345 --> 34:05.260
Unhappy? Me?

34:05.260 --> 34:06.653
You must be.

34:10.004 --> 34:12.267
You don't know
what you're talking about,
young lady.

34:12.267 --> 34:16.141
No, you're right.
I don't, so please
enlighten me.

34:16.141 --> 34:19.796
Tell me why you'd
rather foist me off
to some quack psychiatrist

34:19.796 --> 34:23.409
than just be honest with me,
your own daughter.

34:23.409 --> 34:25.193
What happened?

34:25.193 --> 34:28.414
Things didn't always used to be
so fraught between us.

34:28.414 --> 34:30.546
Something must have happened.

34:30.546 --> 34:32.505
If this is what you're
getting out of
the Dr. Werthers sessions,

34:32.505 --> 34:35.160
then maybe you're right.
We should end them.

34:35.160 --> 34:39.512
You once told me
that you were afraid for me.

34:39.512 --> 34:41.818
Afraid of what
the world might do to me.

34:44.473 --> 34:46.997
But why does it seem
like you're afraid of me?

34:51.350 --> 34:54.004
- Oh, Betty.
- Please...

34:54.004 --> 34:58.313
Just talk to me, Mom.
I'm... I'm right here.

35:00.272 --> 35:01.925
- I...
- What is going on here?

35:07.975 --> 35:10.804
Mom and I
are having a conversation, Dad.
Can you please leave us?

35:10.804 --> 35:11.805
Leave?

35:11.805 --> 35:14.024
This is my house.

35:14.024 --> 35:16.897
And I heard the conversation
you were having, Betty.
Enough of it.

35:19.943 --> 35:21.119
This woman...

35:23.643 --> 35:24.644
This woman...

35:27.299 --> 35:32.434
is the most wonderful wife
and mother in the world.

35:32.434 --> 35:35.698
And the way that
you've been acting,
you don't deserve her.

35:35.698 --> 35:37.004
- Dad.
- Just go to your room.

35:37.004 --> 35:40.094
And do me a favor
and stay there.

35:40.094 --> 35:43.141
And you think about
what you've put
your poor mother through.

35:43.141 --> 35:45.665
- What I've put her through?
- Yes.

35:45.665 --> 35:47.971
When all she's done
is sacrifice for you.

35:47.971 --> 35:49.059
How?

35:51.061 --> 35:52.846
Somebody, please tell me how.

35:52.846 --> 35:55.240
You know what?
Just go to your room,
young lady. Now.

36:12.561 --> 36:13.910
Mom.

36:13.910 --> 36:15.042
Good morning, Elizabeth.

36:23.529 --> 36:24.747
Mom...

36:26.619 --> 36:29.230
I want us to figure out
a path forward.

36:30.753 --> 36:33.191
But it is not Dr. Werthers.

36:33.191 --> 36:36.803
No. It's not.

36:36.803 --> 36:39.762
I relieved Dr. Werthers
of his duties this morning.

36:43.723 --> 36:47.074
And mercifully, he's decided to
not press charges against you
for breaking into his office.

36:48.597 --> 36:51.731
That's good.

36:51.731 --> 36:56.214
Everything that
I have been trying
to do my entire life,

36:57.215 --> 36:59.782
sacrificing for you,

36:59.782 --> 37:01.958
protecting you,
trying to help you...

37:03.525 --> 37:06.485
It's obvious.
You don't want it.

37:08.138 --> 37:09.401
So I'm stopping.

37:11.403 --> 37:13.143
You have all the answers.

37:14.232 --> 37:16.973
You know everything.

37:16.973 --> 37:19.889
Seems to me that you don't
need a mother anymore.

37:19.889 --> 37:20.847
Marvelous.

37:21.848 --> 37:23.284
You don't have one.

37:24.198 --> 37:25.460
What are you saying?

37:26.896 --> 37:30.987
I am not your mother anymore.

37:35.731 --> 37:37.516
And you can make
your own damn breakfast.

37:46.742 --> 37:49.528
You sure she knows I'm here?
It's been half an hour.

37:49.528 --> 37:52.182
Yeah, phone's been ringing
off the hook all day.

37:52.182 --> 37:53.227
I'm sure she'll be down soon.

37:57.057 --> 37:58.972
<i>I was surprised
and pleased</i>

37:58.972 --> 38:02.410
to read about your recent
box office success
in the trades.

38:02.410 --> 38:04.717
I didn't even know
there was such a thing as 4D.

38:04.717 --> 38:08.416
Yes, well, that's the kind
of business the Babylonium
is doing these days.

38:08.416 --> 38:09.896
So I was curious

38:09.896 --> 38:11.941
if you might want to
reconsider your decision

38:11.941 --> 38:14.814
not to let us screen
any of your new releases.

38:14.814 --> 38:17.207
<i>Oh, I am sure we can
work something out.</i>

38:17.207 --> 38:20.950
You know, I've always been
a fan of Riverdale.

38:20.950 --> 38:23.083
Great town, superb audiences.

38:23.083 --> 38:26.782
It's like no place else,
Mr. Roth.

38:26.782 --> 38:30.090
So we'll be getting
that print of <i>East of Eden</i>
for the weekend, I take it?

38:30.090 --> 38:32.005
It's already heading your way.

38:32.875 --> 38:34.703
Fab.

38:34.703 --> 38:38.141
Looking forward to a long,
fruitful collaboration, Peter.

38:38.141 --> 38:40.187
Can I call you Peter?

38:40.187 --> 38:42.102
<i>All right, Reginald.
Sorry to have kept you...</i>

38:42.624 --> 38:44.539
waiting.

38:44.539 --> 38:47.368
- Where's Reggie?
- He got tired of waiting.

38:47.368 --> 38:48.587
He left those for you, though.

39:11.784 --> 39:13.742
Smithers,

39:13.742 --> 39:16.745
there seems to be something
wrong with my lock.

39:16.745 --> 39:19.269
I'm afraid, Miss Veronica,
that the locks
have been changed.

39:19.269 --> 39:23.926
Your parents no longer feel
that you need or deserve
their financial support

39:23.926 --> 39:28.148
now that you're such
a roaring success.

39:28.148 --> 39:31.891
As soon as you have
a new address,
I'm to move your belongings.

39:31.891 --> 39:34.589
An eye for a crawling eye.

39:34.589 --> 39:38.114
As for my address,
I already know
where I'll be staying.

39:38.114 --> 39:39.377
In the short term, at least.

40:38.566 --> 40:40.655
Chocolate, vanilla, strawberry?

40:43.658 --> 40:44.572
I think just the check, Pop.

40:49.098 --> 40:52.232
I've been re-reading
all of Mr. Rayberry's work

40:52.232 --> 40:53.755
and I've noticed some
recurring themes.

40:55.844 --> 40:57.280
Time passes,

40:59.282 --> 41:00.545
seasons change,

41:02.242 --> 41:04.070
life moves on, you know?

41:06.551 --> 41:10.206
I... I don't know
if I'm done mourning,
but I...

41:10.206 --> 41:12.078
I think I'm done wallowing.

41:14.341 --> 41:15.516
I think I'm ready to move on.

41:18.345 --> 41:19.433
I think he'd want me
to move on.

41:21.043 --> 41:21.827
I'm glad to hear it.

41:36.276 --> 41:41.063
Jughead, we're still working
the Rayberry suicide case.

41:41.063 --> 41:42.891
We need your help
if we're gonna solve it.

41:44.327 --> 41:46.286
<i>So much for moving on.</i>
