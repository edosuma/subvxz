WEBVTT

00:00.160 --> 00:01.468
Maya: <i>Is it ready?</i>

00:01.488 --> 00:03.548
Uh, I think so,

00:03.568 --> 00:04.913
but we have to test it.

00:04.933 --> 00:07.348
Okay, it's a little hot. Take a strand.

00:07.368 --> 00:09.100
And throw it against the
wall and if it sticks,

00:09.134 --> 00:10.301
- then it's ready.
- Ella: I want to test it!

00:10.335 --> 00:11.402
- Yeah, go for it.
- Both: Me, too.

00:11.436 --> 00:12.403
All right, grab one piece.

00:12.437 --> 00:13.437
You can do it.

00:13.472 --> 00:14.973
- <i>Yeah!
- Lina: Hey!</i>

00:15.007 --> 00:16.074
<i>Hey. Whoa. Hey! Hey!</i>

00:16.108 --> 00:17.441
Guys. Guys!

00:17.476 --> 00:19.461
Daddy's showing us how to test spaghetti.

00:19.481 --> 00:21.445
Really? Well, there's

00:21.480 --> 00:23.998
another way to test it... you can eat it.

00:24.018 --> 00:25.449
- Yeah.
- Why is Daddy so fun?

00:25.484 --> 00:26.964
Yeah, why? Why?

00:26.984 --> 00:28.785
- I can be fun.
- Well...

00:28.820 --> 00:29.786
You don't need to be fun.

00:29.821 --> 00:32.122
- You're reliable.
- Great.

00:32.156 --> 00:34.108
(laughing) I'm reliable.

00:34.128 --> 00:36.862
S02E10

00:36.882 --> 00:39.266
sync and corrected by ninh
www.addic7ed.com

00:41.457 --> 00:42.466
Lina: <i>"Reliable."</i>

00:42.501 --> 00:43.634
That's the worst thing to be called.

00:43.668 --> 00:44.835
That's worse than the "C" word.

00:44.869 --> 00:46.504
I would rather be called the "C" word.

00:46.538 --> 00:48.476
- Consistent?
- You're hilarious.

00:48.496 --> 00:50.541
I am hilarious... ask the kids.

00:50.575 --> 00:52.510
Lina:
Of course they think you're the fun one.

00:52.544 --> 00:53.910
They didn't ruin you.

00:53.945 --> 00:56.013
Kids only destroy their mothers.

00:56.047 --> 00:58.048
Emotionally or vaginally?

00:59.217 --> 01:00.451
Both.

01:00.485 --> 01:03.862
AJ: Speaking of destroying vaginas...

01:03.882 --> 01:05.955
Uh... tomorrow's a big day for us.

01:05.989 --> 01:07.857
Yeah, we have let

01:07.891 --> 01:10.293
our passion marinate for quite long enough,

01:10.327 --> 01:12.629
and now it's time to fire up the grill!

01:12.663 --> 01:14.297
He's talking about sex.

01:14.331 --> 01:16.366
Yeah, we-we got it.

01:16.400 --> 01:17.800
I got us a suite at Shutters.

01:17.834 --> 01:20.470
We are going to have a sex-friendly dinner.

01:20.504 --> 01:22.038
Mm-hmm. No entrees, no roughage.

01:22.072 --> 01:24.174
No chili dogs, no goulash.

01:24.208 --> 01:26.576
And then... uh, showtime!

01:26.610 --> 01:27.544
(both laughing)

01:27.578 --> 01:28.878
Showtime.

01:28.912 --> 01:30.079
Well, we wish you the best.

01:30.113 --> 01:31.214
To great sex.

01:31.248 --> 01:32.715
Yeah, you deserve it.

01:32.749 --> 01:34.217
All right. You guys should meet us

01:34.251 --> 01:35.685
for brunch on Sunday; we'll be famished.

01:35.719 --> 01:38.054
Yeah. Chili dogs on us.

01:38.088 --> 01:39.922
No, we can't. We're gonna be up at Beekman.

01:39.956 --> 01:41.857
We're going back to college.

01:41.892 --> 01:45.307
Yeah, my old professor wants
me to talk to his class.

01:45.327 --> 01:46.729
Huh.

01:46.763 --> 01:48.698
Yeah,
I'm actually thinking of bailing on it.

01:48.732 --> 01:51.067
Like, what do I say to a bunch of students?

01:51.101 --> 01:52.735
We're not bailing. We're going.

01:52.769 --> 01:54.904
And we're gonna party like it's 1997.

01:54.938 --> 01:56.405
Abby: What's 1997?

01:56.439 --> 01:58.571
That's when I used to be fun.

01:58.978 --> 02:00.646
Oh.

02:07.781 --> 02:10.476
Look,
I still have my rape whistle from college.

02:10.496 --> 02:11.920
Aw, that's cute. (whistle blows)

02:11.954 --> 02:13.222
You still think you're rape-able.

02:13.256 --> 02:14.356
(chuckles)

02:14.390 --> 02:16.057
Ow!

02:16.092 --> 02:17.526
Ooh, you all right?

02:17.560 --> 02:19.228
Yeah, I'm fine.

02:19.262 --> 02:21.062
College, right?

02:21.794 --> 02:24.780
Hey, do you want to get a drink?
Do we have time?

02:24.800 --> 02:26.826
I probably should go over my notes.

02:26.846 --> 02:28.707
Why are you so nervous?

02:28.727 --> 02:29.770
'Cause I don't...

02:29.804 --> 02:31.606
I mean, what if the kids think I'm,
like, a sellout?

02:31.640 --> 02:33.140
Why would they think that?

02:33.174 --> 02:35.525
Because, look... I look like "The Man."

02:35.545 --> 02:38.246
That's cute that you
think you look like a man.

02:39.035 --> 02:40.615
Touchee.

02:40.649 --> 02:42.416
(groans) Should we get out of here?

02:42.451 --> 02:43.584
Babe, no.

02:43.619 --> 02:45.151
This is a big deal.

02:45.185 --> 02:46.286
You're a working designer.

02:46.320 --> 02:47.920
You're speaking at our college.

02:47.955 --> 02:49.322
This means you're successful.

02:49.357 --> 02:50.657
It does?

02:50.691 --> 02:52.925
They're not asking me to speak here.

02:52.960 --> 02:54.594
What would I say?

02:54.629 --> 02:56.095
"Here's how you get pregnant."

02:57.693 --> 02:58.431
(groans) All right.

02:58.466 --> 03:00.166
This is it.

03:00.200 --> 03:02.702
So, maybe we meet up later?

03:02.737 --> 03:04.137
You don't want me to watch?

03:04.171 --> 03:05.972
I'll laugh at all your jokes.

03:06.006 --> 03:08.975
No, I got to be, like,
all business in there.

03:09.009 --> 03:11.610
I can't be Business Russ
if you're sitting there.

03:11.645 --> 03:13.246
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

03:13.280 --> 03:16.249
I will meet you at the
Kettle Room afterwards, okay?

03:16.283 --> 03:17.583
We'll party like it's 1997.

03:17.617 --> 03:19.986
What am I gonna do for the next two hours?

03:20.020 --> 03:22.121
You'll figure something out.

03:24.324 --> 03:26.458
(sighs)

03:28.000 --> 03:34.074

03:41.704 --> 03:44.310
So, next to the student
store is the Polk Building,

03:44.344 --> 03:46.523
which actually has a very
interesting history...

03:46.543 --> 03:48.179
It started out as a gold exchange,

03:48.213 --> 03:51.078
where prospectors sold
their gold during the rush.

03:51.098 --> 03:52.536
(chuckles) That's right.

03:52.556 --> 03:54.319
Sorry, I used to be a tour guide here.

03:54.353 --> 03:56.053
When I went here, a while ago.

03:56.087 --> 03:57.888
I was a business major.

03:57.923 --> 03:59.890
Not that I ever use that degree. (laughs)

03:59.925 --> 04:02.493
- Um, up ahead is...
- I'm a mom.

04:02.528 --> 04:04.462
And I have a job. I'm a teacher.

04:04.496 --> 04:06.596
Well, teaching assistant they call it.

04:06.631 --> 04:07.998
Cool story.

04:08.033 --> 04:10.434
Um, so up ahead is Dornan Hall, which is...

04:10.468 --> 04:13.037
Oh, home of the rooftop garden.

04:13.071 --> 04:14.504
I'm sorry, I don't know
anything about a rooftop garden,

04:14.539 --> 04:15.873
but maybe, uh, that was...

04:15.907 --> 04:17.308
You don't know about the rooftop garden?

04:17.341 --> 04:18.809
No.

04:18.844 --> 04:20.377
What kind of tour is this?

04:20.411 --> 04:22.546
It's the tour that <i>I'm</i> giving.

04:22.580 --> 04:25.048
Uh, so up to the left...

04:25.082 --> 04:27.217
AJ: <i>I'm gonna get you.</i> <i>You can't match me.</i>

04:27.251 --> 04:29.986
(laughs) Here we go!

04:30.020 --> 04:31.487
Where are you?

04:31.521 --> 04:33.656
(gasps) There's the bad guy plane!

04:33.690 --> 04:35.691
See... I-I got you! I got you! Oh, no, no.

04:35.726 --> 04:36.893
- AJ?
- Yeah?

04:36.927 --> 04:38.228
Can I talk to you for a sec?

04:38.262 --> 04:40.029
Oh, okay, yeah. I'll be right back.

04:40.064 --> 04:41.530
Don't kill me.

04:41.565 --> 04:43.666
What's wrong?

04:43.700 --> 04:45.033
The sitter canceled.

04:45.068 --> 04:46.101
That's terrible.

04:46.135 --> 04:47.202
Who's your backup?

04:47.237 --> 04:48.703
I don't have one.

04:48.738 --> 04:50.239
Um,
can we just get the hotel another night?

04:50.273 --> 04:51.573
Wait, wait, wait, wait. No.

04:51.607 --> 04:53.208
- Tonight's the night.
- Chase: AJ!

04:53.243 --> 04:54.609
Mm-hmm. I know, I'm so sorry.
(Chase shouting)

04:54.643 --> 04:55.911
I was really looking forward to it, too.

04:55.945 --> 04:57.045
You don't understand.

04:57.080 --> 04:58.713
The genie is out of the bottle.

04:58.748 --> 05:02.100
He can't get back inside
until he satisfies his master.

05:02.472 --> 05:04.644
So... am I the master?

05:04.923 --> 05:06.321
Whatever. We can take turns.

05:06.356 --> 05:09.491
Okay, uh, maybe after Chase goes to bed?

05:09.525 --> 05:10.658
(sighs)

05:10.693 --> 05:13.023
AJ: Hey, Chase, you feeling tired?

05:13.783 --> 05:15.663
Yeah, let's put him to bed.
Let's put him to sleep.

05:15.698 --> 05:17.932
You got any Benadryl?

05:19.101 --> 05:20.101
Are you serious?

05:20.135 --> 05:21.536
(chuckles) No.

05:21.570 --> 05:22.771
No, I'm joking.

05:22.805 --> 05:25.072
You got some melatonin though or...?

05:33.641 --> 05:35.642
Back at the Kettle!

05:35.948 --> 05:38.472
I take it Business Russ was a hit?

05:38.492 --> 05:42.148
I mean, all the kids loved me,
and they all wanted internships.

05:42.168 --> 05:44.025
They loved you or they wanted internships?

05:44.045 --> 05:45.933
The important thing is Donny,

05:45.953 --> 05:48.855
my new intern, said that he could totally

05:48.889 --> 05:50.803
hook us up with 'shrooms.

05:50.823 --> 05:52.123
Oh, cool.

05:52.157 --> 05:53.725
Come on, I thought you'd be more excited.

05:53.759 --> 05:55.435
1997?

05:55.455 --> 05:57.729
No, I'm super excited.

05:57.763 --> 05:59.864
It's just that, um...

05:59.898 --> 06:02.334
Do you remember the garden

06:02.368 --> 06:03.835
on top of Dornan Hall?

06:03.869 --> 06:05.370
Uh...

06:05.404 --> 06:07.505
Where we had our first kiss?

06:07.540 --> 06:09.173
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

06:09.208 --> 06:10.375
Yeah.

06:10.409 --> 06:12.344
- They closed it.
- Yeah.

06:12.378 --> 06:14.178
It's faculty housing now... isn't that sad?

06:14.213 --> 06:16.714
- That is sad.
- I know.

06:16.749 --> 06:18.249
'Shrooms?

06:18.283 --> 06:19.383
'Shrooms.

06:19.417 --> 06:20.684
Oh, yeah.

06:20.719 --> 06:21.884
(chuckles)

06:21.904 --> 06:23.955
Man, I crushed a lot of girls' dreams here.

06:23.989 --> 06:25.223
- Whoa.
- Mm-hmm.

06:25.257 --> 06:26.390
I don't remember it that way.

06:26.424 --> 06:28.793
Abby: <i>"The kitty had cheese,</i>

06:28.827 --> 06:31.729
"but no grill.
She's like, 'What am I going to do?

06:31.764 --> 06:33.731
This cheese won't...'"

06:33.766 --> 06:35.266
AJ: Hey, hey, hey, hey. How's it going?

06:35.300 --> 06:36.300
Great.

06:36.334 --> 06:38.136
(laughs): I can see that.

06:38.170 --> 06:40.571
All right, well, let me try.

06:40.605 --> 06:43.907
I have the kind of voice that can
make people do whatever I say.

06:43.941 --> 06:45.809
Okay.

06:45.843 --> 06:48.135
Try to get some sleep.

06:51.115 --> 06:53.584
All right, now you go in the bedroom

06:53.618 --> 06:55.786
and you get started without me.

06:55.820 --> 06:57.688
Hmm? Okay.

06:57.722 --> 06:59.590
See? See what I just did?

06:59.624 --> 07:00.957
You got me.

07:00.992 --> 07:02.760
(chuckles)

07:02.794 --> 07:06.096
Oh, boy, Chase.

07:07.950 --> 07:09.433
All right, what do we got here?

07:09.467 --> 07:11.267
We got some books.

07:11.302 --> 07:14.904
Oh, boy, this is one of my favorites.

07:14.938 --> 07:17.239
So, if we take the 'shrooms by 10:00,

07:17.274 --> 07:18.775
then when will they wear off?

07:18.809 --> 07:20.410
Hopefully never.

07:20.444 --> 07:22.645
Well, which one of us is gonna
drive to soccer tomorrow?

07:22.680 --> 07:25.080
Aw, are you being Miss Reliable?

07:25.115 --> 07:27.283
That's me.
(chuckles)

07:29.553 --> 07:31.153
What?

07:31.188 --> 07:33.323
I just want to pop up to the
roof garden really quick.

07:33.357 --> 07:35.156
What?

07:35.191 --> 07:38.627
I thought you said this
was faculty housing now.

07:38.661 --> 07:40.295
(sighs)

07:40.330 --> 07:42.297
Maybe someone will buzz us in.

07:42.935 --> 07:44.499
Oh, Professor Holt's still here.

07:44.534 --> 07:46.134
(line rings)

07:46.168 --> 07:47.302
Holt: Hello?

07:47.337 --> 07:48.370
Hi, um...

07:48.404 --> 07:49.871
this is a little out of the blue,

07:49.905 --> 07:53.141
but, um, I'm Lina Bow... Weston.

07:53.175 --> 07:54.876
I, uh... who-who?

07:54.910 --> 07:56.044
I posed for you.

07:56.078 --> 07:59.080
(door buzzes)

07:59.114 --> 08:01.316
- You posed?
- No.

08:01.350 --> 08:03.151
Lina Weston did.

08:03.185 --> 08:04.853
In the raw.

08:04.887 --> 08:08.264
- Naked?
- Tits to the wind.

08:08.824 --> 08:10.325
How did I not know this?

08:10.359 --> 08:11.960
There's a lot you don't know about me.

08:11.994 --> 08:13.794
I have layers.

08:13.829 --> 08:15.463
(chuckles) Sorry.

08:15.497 --> 08:17.165
"Layers"?

08:17.199 --> 08:19.133
I had a whole life before you.

08:19.168 --> 08:20.634
Uh, we were 20 when we met.

08:20.669 --> 08:22.170
I wouldn't say you had a whole life.

08:22.204 --> 08:24.005
I had some of a life.

08:26.619 --> 08:28.008
(groans)

08:28.042 --> 08:29.709
Why does it have to be locked?

08:29.744 --> 08:32.712
Are you sure there's a garden up there?

08:32.746 --> 08:34.047
Yes.

08:34.082 --> 08:36.328
It's where we had our first kiss.

08:36.349 --> 08:39.052
I know that.

08:39.087 --> 08:41.520
Maybe Donald has roof access.

08:41.554 --> 08:43.556
Wait. "Donald"?

08:43.591 --> 08:44.858
The Professor.

08:44.893 --> 08:47.694
Why do you call him Donald?

08:47.728 --> 08:49.696
I call a lot of people Donald.

08:50.678 --> 08:51.698
Okay.

08:51.732 --> 08:54.534
(upbeat music playing inside)

08:54.568 --> 08:56.068
Sounds like a party.

08:56.103 --> 08:57.404
What should we do?

08:57.438 --> 09:00.039
What would Lina Weston do?

09:05.295 --> 09:07.847
I do not think we'll find the
'shrooms here.

09:07.882 --> 09:10.216
Don't worry, you'll get your 'shrooms.

09:10.250 --> 09:12.385
We need to get to the roof.

09:12.420 --> 09:14.186
Wow.

09:14.221 --> 09:16.688
Hello, ladies.

09:16.723 --> 09:18.390
Hey.

09:18.425 --> 09:19.525
Is that you?

09:19.559 --> 09:21.059
She's Polynesian.

09:21.093 --> 09:23.194
Yeah, well,
you said you had a whole life before me.

09:23.229 --> 09:25.196
So maybe that's what you
looked like before we met.

09:25.231 --> 09:26.264
I'm just kidding.

09:26.299 --> 09:27.533
- You're right there, see?
- Yeah.

09:27.567 --> 09:28.600
That's a dude.

09:28.635 --> 09:30.068
Well, you said you had layers.

09:30.102 --> 09:32.270
Maybe one of those
layers was a huge wiener.

09:32.305 --> 09:34.105
Seriously though, where am I?

09:34.140 --> 09:37.743
I was full-frontal and
my foot was on the sink.

09:39.278 --> 09:41.212
Who are you?

09:41.247 --> 09:43.248
All right.

09:43.282 --> 09:46.151
That is your last book.

09:46.185 --> 09:48.253
Can you make up a story?

09:48.287 --> 09:50.621
If I make up a story,
you promise you'll go to sleep?

09:50.656 --> 09:51.589
Yeah.

09:51.623 --> 09:53.124
Okay.

09:53.159 --> 09:55.260
All right, I got a good one.

09:55.294 --> 09:56.661
(chuckles softly)

09:56.695 --> 09:58.596
It's about a farmer.

09:58.630 --> 10:01.266
Farmer...

10:01.300 --> 10:02.934
Todd.

10:02.969 --> 10:04.933
And he lived on a farm.

10:04.953 --> 10:07.105
And he was happy.

10:07.139 --> 10:10.842
And he liked to drink milk, in moderation.

10:10.876 --> 10:14.778
Until Farmer Todd's wife

10:14.812 --> 10:16.713
decided to leave the farm

10:16.747 --> 10:20.387
in the tractor that he had
given her for her birthday.

10:20.407 --> 10:23.387
And then she used that tractor

10:23.421 --> 10:25.555
to help plow another farmer's field.

10:25.590 --> 10:26.656
(chuckles softly)

10:26.691 --> 10:28.558
And Farmer Todd was alone.

10:28.593 --> 10:30.560
Then what happened?

10:30.595 --> 10:34.966
Well,
Farmer Todd made himself feel way better

10:34.986 --> 10:36.983
with a tall glass of milk.

10:37.003 --> 10:38.897
And then another and then another.

10:38.917 --> 10:42.739
Pretty soon,
he was drinking four or five before lunch.

10:42.773 --> 10:46.076
Why did he drink so much glasses of milk?

10:46.111 --> 10:49.412
Because he was going
through a very thirsty time.

10:49.446 --> 10:52.926
Farmer Todd didn't realize it yet,
but he had a problem.

10:52.946 --> 10:54.803
A big problem.

10:54.823 --> 10:57.286
What was the big problem?

10:57.321 --> 10:58.955
Well, his problem was

10:58.990 --> 11:01.725
he had something called a God-sized hole

11:01.759 --> 11:03.359
that he couldn't fill,

11:03.394 --> 11:05.695
no matter how many things he put into it.

11:05.730 --> 11:07.563
It's a hole on the inside of you,

11:07.583 --> 11:10.200
in your soul, and it never fills up,

11:10.220 --> 11:12.899
no matter how much milk you pour in.

11:19.610 --> 11:21.544
Lina: Did you find me yet?

11:21.578 --> 11:23.413
That depends. Were you ever an amputee?

11:24.490 --> 11:25.915
(sighs) I don't get it.

11:25.949 --> 11:27.116
I checked every wall.

11:27.151 --> 11:28.584
- Honey...
- But...

11:28.618 --> 11:29.952
It's okay if you dreamed this whole thing.

11:29.986 --> 11:31.288
I didn't dream it up.

11:31.308 --> 11:34.545
I was a nude model in real life.

11:34.565 --> 11:37.293
Look, no one wants to see
you naked more than I do.

11:37.327 --> 11:40.005
- Okay?
- Then let's go upstairs and keep looking.

11:42.433 --> 11:44.133
(whispers): Come on.

11:47.336 --> 11:48.904
Whoa.

11:48.939 --> 11:50.439
All right, I got to be here somewhere.

11:50.473 --> 11:53.442
I want to paint naked co-eds.

11:53.476 --> 11:54.896
How do I become a professor?

11:54.911 --> 11:57.313
I mean, he must have a picture

11:57.347 --> 11:59.749
of every student's vagina but mine.

11:59.783 --> 12:01.617
How come I didn't make the cut?

12:01.652 --> 12:04.287
I wonder what her major was.

12:04.321 --> 12:06.088
Also, check this out.

12:06.122 --> 12:07.823
"Hi." "Hi."

12:07.857 --> 12:09.825
"Want to sixty-nine?" "Uh-huh."

12:09.859 --> 12:11.293
Sixty-nine.

12:11.327 --> 12:12.594
(both laugh, door opens)

12:12.628 --> 12:13.995
Lina: Professor Holt.

12:14.029 --> 12:15.764
What are you doing here? Russ: Uh...

12:15.798 --> 12:18.433
Art appreciation?

12:18.467 --> 12:19.668
(chuckles)

12:19.702 --> 12:21.303
How you doing? Good to...

12:23.867 --> 12:26.266
So you posed for me.

12:26.286 --> 12:27.931
- Yeah.
- Usually, I remember.

12:27.951 --> 12:30.423
Lina, Lina, Lina.

12:30.924 --> 12:32.812
You were a photography student, correct?

12:32.832 --> 12:34.007
Lina: No.

12:34.027 --> 12:35.327
Uh, mixed media?

12:35.361 --> 12:36.961
Nope.

12:36.996 --> 12:38.763
I was a business major.

12:38.797 --> 12:40.298
Class of '97.

12:40.333 --> 12:42.434
I took your sculpting class.

12:42.468 --> 12:44.436
Of course, right, I remember now.

12:44.470 --> 12:46.504
I'm so sorry. You were an Army brat, right?

12:46.538 --> 12:48.772
You grew up in Germany,
you like to play volleyball,

12:48.806 --> 12:51.142
got that beautiful,
beautiful singing voice.

12:52.186 --> 12:53.444
No?

12:53.478 --> 12:55.646
Well, I... sometimes I, uh...

12:56.234 --> 12:57.615
Ah, just a second.

12:57.649 --> 12:59.250
Just a second.

12:59.284 --> 13:00.888
Ah.

13:00.908 --> 13:03.287
I think this... No, no.

13:03.321 --> 13:04.821
Sorry about that, I'm wrong again.

13:04.856 --> 13:07.124
This is Marcie. She was fantastic.

13:07.159 --> 13:08.924
She's a heart surgeon now in Dallas.

13:08.959 --> 13:11.261
Uh, that one over there, that's Tania.

13:11.295 --> 13:13.626
She's got her own cooking show in Houston.

13:13.646 --> 13:15.765
And last week, we got a postcard

13:15.799 --> 13:17.267
from Juliette over there.

13:17.301 --> 13:19.269
She's assistant editor of <i>Paris Vogue.</i>

13:19.303 --> 13:21.504
So, uh, what do you do now, Lina?

13:22.636 --> 13:24.507
Well, we live in...

13:24.542 --> 13:26.709
Wine country.

13:28.812 --> 13:31.648
We... have a bed and breakfast there.

13:32.149 --> 13:35.350
That... (clears throat)
we restored ourselves.

13:35.385 --> 13:37.853
And we grow our own grapes.

13:37.888 --> 13:39.855
Oh, lovely. You guys have kids?

13:39.890 --> 13:42.324
No. No.

13:42.358 --> 13:44.160
We did not.

13:44.194 --> 13:46.662
We... we, um...

13:46.697 --> 13:50.700
He couldn't, so we didn't do that.

13:50.734 --> 13:52.034
Right.

13:52.069 --> 13:54.336
Lina: But we have other stuff.

13:54.370 --> 13:56.505
- We have Harleys.
- That's right.

13:56.539 --> 13:57.940
We have two Harleys.

13:57.974 --> 13:59.474
Yeah. Actually, three. (groans)

13:59.509 --> 14:01.109
Yeah. I always forget about the little one.

14:01.143 --> 14:02.444
The third was an accident.

14:02.478 --> 14:03.612
(Lina laughs) It's a smaller bike.

14:03.646 --> 14:04.846
Lina: You know, when you ride

14:04.880 --> 14:06.147
without a helmet,

14:06.182 --> 14:07.549
- anything can happen.
- Yeah, right.

14:07.584 --> 14:08.817
Well, l-let me see

14:08.851 --> 14:09.851
if I can't find your nude somewhere.

14:09.885 --> 14:11.687
Yeah, let's find her.

14:15.191 --> 14:17.392
She told Farmer Todd she was 18,

14:17.427 --> 14:19.494
but it's hard to tell how old a chicken is,

14:19.529 --> 14:21.996
especially when she's Puerto Rican.

14:22.031 --> 14:24.666
So, milk isn't enough anymore.

14:24.701 --> 14:27.401
Farmer Todd is now snorting corn meal.

14:27.436 --> 14:28.669
He can't think straight.

14:28.704 --> 14:29.903
He keeps thinking the pigs,

14:29.938 --> 14:31.339
who are supposed to be his friends,

14:31.373 --> 14:32.506
are plotting against him.

14:32.541 --> 14:34.327
Well, guess what happens

14:34.347 --> 14:36.510
when he breaks into the pig pen?

14:36.545 --> 14:42.383
He finds 60 grand... in hay.

14:43.791 --> 14:45.553
Now who's...

14:45.587 --> 14:47.421
paranoid?

14:58.866 --> 15:00.667
Holt: Well, I'm sorry to say

15:00.701 --> 15:02.502
I can't imagine where your
painting could've got to.

15:02.536 --> 15:04.036
We did lose a couple in the fire.

15:04.071 --> 15:06.205
Man, I picked the wrong career.

15:06.240 --> 15:08.341
Did you, uh, attend school here also?

15:08.376 --> 15:10.577
I don't know.

15:10.611 --> 15:12.545
- Did I?
- Yes.

15:12.580 --> 15:14.947
We actually met here

15:14.982 --> 15:17.784
and had our first kiss...

15:17.818 --> 15:19.552
in the garden on the roof.

15:19.587 --> 15:22.254
Well, that must've been before the jumpers.

15:22.289 --> 15:23.555
Lina: Jumpers?

15:23.590 --> 15:25.090
Suicide Garden.

15:25.124 --> 15:26.958
Wait. Suicide Garden?

15:26.993 --> 15:28.627
That's what they call it?

15:28.662 --> 15:30.962
Well, not officially, no.

15:33.099 --> 15:35.401
Um... Well, how do we get up there?

15:35.435 --> 15:36.568
Well, you can't.

15:36.603 --> 15:37.903
I mean, it's off-limits now,

15:37.937 --> 15:40.105
because... you know, because...

15:40.139 --> 15:42.408
(whistles, imitates explosion)

15:42.442 --> 15:44.743
But...

15:44.778 --> 15:47.446
aren't you the one that taught
me to challenge authority?

15:47.480 --> 15:48.847
Well, yeah, possibly.
To be honest with you,

15:48.881 --> 15:50.648
I can't quite place your face still.

15:50.683 --> 15:51.949
Okay, I get it.

15:51.983 --> 15:53.785
Um, why don't we, um...

15:53.819 --> 15:55.320
you know, go up there anyway?

15:55.354 --> 15:56.754
How about carpe diem?

15:56.789 --> 15:59.557
I mean, come on, like...
it's a beautiful garden

15:59.591 --> 16:01.592
and now no one can even enjoy it,

16:01.627 --> 16:03.561
even if you don't want to kill yourself?

16:03.595 --> 16:06.564
It's not a party until you
break a couple of rules, right?

16:06.598 --> 16:08.966
- Yeah!
- Here we go.

16:11.770 --> 16:13.103
(sighs)

16:15.140 --> 16:18.275
Well, that is a great kid you have there...

16:18.310 --> 16:20.477
lying right next to you.

16:20.511 --> 16:23.113
He was worried about Farmer Todd.

16:23.148 --> 16:25.615
Is Farmer Todd gonna be okay?

16:25.650 --> 16:27.818
Oh, buddy.

16:27.853 --> 16:29.619
Don't worry.

16:29.654 --> 16:32.689
Farmer Todd's gonna come out on top.

16:33.572 --> 16:35.860
But not tonight.

16:37.395 --> 16:39.796
No.

16:39.831 --> 16:41.832
Good night, guys.

16:50.008 --> 16:52.075
You're really right,
Lori; it is kind of beautiful up here.

16:52.109 --> 16:53.076
It's Lina.

16:53.110 --> 16:54.544
Right. Sorry.

16:54.579 --> 16:55.846
Listen, let me ask you:
have you ever modeled?

16:55.880 --> 16:56.780
You have an extraordinary look.

16:56.814 --> 16:57.947
It's really powerful.

16:57.982 --> 16:59.516
Oh, wait.

16:59.550 --> 17:02.249
This is where we had our first kiss.

17:03.040 --> 17:04.354
That's what I've been saying.

17:04.388 --> 17:06.522
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
it's all coming back to me now.

17:06.557 --> 17:08.290
(laughs): Finally.

17:08.325 --> 17:11.795
We were watching your roommate
puke on the quad, right?

17:11.829 --> 17:13.128
Yeah.

17:13.163 --> 17:15.131
Right here, and that is when you thought

17:15.165 --> 17:17.666
it would be the perfect
time to make your move.

17:17.702 --> 17:19.301
Yeah.

17:19.336 --> 17:21.670
Lina Weston, pretty cool.

17:21.704 --> 17:23.314
(laughs)

17:23.840 --> 17:26.541
Too bad she's dead now.

17:26.576 --> 17:28.544
- She's not dead.
- Now she's just

17:28.578 --> 17:30.713
someone's wife, someone's mom,

17:30.747 --> 17:32.882
someone's pet owner.

17:32.917 --> 17:33.849
Come on.

17:33.884 --> 17:36.352
Nobody's cool forever.

17:36.387 --> 17:38.087
Right?

17:38.122 --> 17:41.281
We can be cool tonight.

17:41.932 --> 17:43.092
I could still be cool.

17:43.127 --> 17:45.075
- Right?
- Yeah.

17:48.132 --> 17:49.265
What are you doing?

17:49.300 --> 17:51.533
Be careful.
(laughs)

17:51.567 --> 17:53.402
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Reliable.

17:53.436 --> 17:54.903
Is this making you uncomfortable?

17:54.938 --> 17:56.571
- Lina, honestly, be careful.
- Is this...

17:56.605 --> 17:58.373
- Is it making you uncomfortable?
- Please don't do that.

17:58.408 --> 18:00.375
Who's responsible now, Dad?

18:00.410 --> 18:01.743
Lina...

18:01.777 --> 18:04.079
(whoops) Go, Purple!

18:04.113 --> 18:05.580
Class of '97! (siren whoops)

18:05.614 --> 18:06.714
- Russ: Lina...
- Do not jump!

18:06.749 --> 18:07.882
It's okay.

18:07.917 --> 18:09.017
Oh, shit.

18:09.052 --> 18:10.352
Officer: Stay where you are!

18:10.386 --> 18:11.853
Is that a real cop?

18:11.887 --> 18:13.088
Campus security.

18:13.122 --> 18:14.522
- Oh.
- Sorry!

18:14.557 --> 18:16.024
Sorry!

18:16.059 --> 18:18.360
I promise, I am not depressed.

18:18.394 --> 18:20.562
- I...
- Are you sure?

18:20.596 --> 18:22.030
I got the number of a counselor

18:22.065 --> 18:23.365
if you need someone to talk to.

18:23.399 --> 18:24.766
No. Seriously, I'm fine.

18:24.800 --> 18:26.701
Yeah, we were just goofing around.

18:26.735 --> 18:28.369
Well, in the future,

18:28.403 --> 18:30.705
you might want to be a
little more responsible.

18:30.739 --> 18:32.907
Okay. Have a good night.

18:32.942 --> 18:34.308
You, too.

18:37.780 --> 18:40.114
What are you smiling about?

18:40.148 --> 18:43.751
I got busted by campus security.

18:43.786 --> 18:45.787
Nothing reliable about that.

18:45.821 --> 18:47.254
(laughs)

18:47.289 --> 18:48.994
I'm framing this.

19:03.943 --> 19:05.810
Another chili dog?

19:06.730 --> 19:08.312
Sir?

19:08.545 --> 19:09.848
Let me ask you a question.

19:09.868 --> 19:13.784
Would you ever buy
a children's book about addiction?

19:13.804 --> 19:16.620
Um, I guess.

19:16.654 --> 19:17.836
Yeah.

19:18.940 --> 19:20.652
Chili dogs for everyone!
