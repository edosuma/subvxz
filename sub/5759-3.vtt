WEBVTT

00:01.160 --> 00:02.263
PREVIOUSLY ON
PRETI'Y LI'ITLE LIARS...
Aria: WHAT THE...?

00:05.270 --> 00:07.192
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
SAVING YOUR MOM.

00:07.240 --> 00:11.233
ALL THIS FOR
A MUDDY COP CAR
AND A DEAD PIG?

00:11.270 --> 00:14.068
WHO'S THAT FOR?
JESSICA DiLAURENTIS.
SHE'S MOVING BACK.

00:14.110 --> 00:16.249
BACK TO THEIR OLD HOUSE?

00:16.280 --> 00:19.772
ARE YOU SURE THE RV
IS SAFE IN HERE?
IT'LL BE FINE FOR A FEW DAYS.

00:19.820 --> 00:22.288
THERE'S STUFF IN THERE
THAT CAN BRING US ALL DOWN.

00:24.120 --> 00:27.248
"CLOSED CASKETS KEEP SECRETS.
HIS IS OPEN AND EXPOSES YOURS."

00:27.290 --> 00:30.259
THERE'S SOMETHING IN THAT COFFIN
THAT'S INCRIMINATING TO US.

00:30.290 --> 00:32.019
WHY ARE YOU CALLING ME
ON MY MOM'S PHONE?

00:33.300 --> 00:35.450
WHO IS THAT?

00:35.500 --> 00:36.990
I'M OFFICER HOLBROOKE.
MY PARTNER AND I

00:37.030 --> 00:40.659
ARE INVESTIGATING THE MURDERS
OF OFFICER REYNOLDS
AND DETECTIVE WILDEN.

00:40.700 --> 00:42.258
JUST HERE TO
FIND OUT THE TRUTH.

00:42.310 --> 00:44.164
"THE TRUTH WON'T
SET YOU FREE, BITCHES."

00:51.380 --> 00:53.519
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOUR MOM CALLED YOU
FROM NEW YORK?

00:53.550 --> 00:56.542
I DON'T KNOW, THE DAY BEFORE
YESTERDAY. I HAVEN'T REALLY
BEEN KEEPING TRACK.

00:56.590 --> 00:59.286
HAVE YOU CHECKED YOUR PHONE?
SHE CALLED ME FROM
THE HOTEL ROOM, EMILY.

00:59.320 --> 01:01.151
SHE HAS NO CELL.

01:01.190 --> 01:03.454
WHO WAS THAT FREAKY WOMAN
AT THE FUNERAL?

01:03.490 --> 01:06.129
WHICH FREAKY WOMAN?
THERE WAS A COUPLE, HAN.
THE ONE IN BLACK

01:06.160 --> 01:08.424
WITH THE VEIL,
AND SHE WAS JUST DIVING
INTO THAT TOWN CAR.

01:08.460 --> 01:12.294
SPEAKING OF FREAKS,
WHERE'S MELISSA?

01:12.340 --> 01:13.796
SPENCER?
WHAT?

01:13.840 --> 01:15.296
WHERE'S YOUR SISTER BEEN?

01:15.340 --> 01:18.309
D.C. SHE'S INTERVIEWING
FOR AN INTERNSHIP.

01:18.340 --> 01:20.103
WITH WHO, SATAN?
WAIT A SECOND.

01:20.140 --> 01:21.676
YOU THINK THAT MELISSA
WAS THE WOMAN IN BLACK?

01:21.710 --> 01:23.769
DO YOU?
I DIDN'T REALLY
GET A GOOD LOOK AT HER.

01:23.810 --> 01:24.742
I WAS TRYING
NOT TO WET MYSELF

01:24.780 --> 01:27.271
WHEN THAT NEW COP
MADE A BEELINE OVER FOR US.

01:27.320 --> 01:30.687
WELL, HE CAN BEELINE
ALL HE WANTS. WE DIDN'T
DO ANYTHING TO WILDEN.

01:30.720 --> 01:32.608
EXCEPT FOR
THROW HIS CAR IN A LAKE

01:32.660 --> 01:33.888
AND LEAVE FINGERPRINTS
ALL OVER IT

01:33.920 --> 01:35.854
WHEN "A" PULLED IT OUT.

01:35.890 --> 01:37.824
SPENCER,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
WITH MY FRENCH FRIES?

01:37.860 --> 01:39.851
I'M RE-CREATED THE GEOGRAPHY
AROUND THE LODGE

01:39.900 --> 01:42.562
TO SEE IF IT'S EVEN POSSIBLE
THAT THE PERSON
WHO JUMPED OUT OF THE PLANE

01:42.600 --> 01:44.761
COULD RESCUE YOU THREE
FROM A BURNING BUILDING.

01:44.800 --> 01:46.768
WAIT. PUT DOWN
THE MOZZARELLA STICK.

01:46.800 --> 01:48.665
IT'S MINE.
NO, IT'S NOT.

01:48.700 --> 01:50.429
IT'S A PLANE.

01:50.470 --> 01:53.439
SPENCER, YOU CAN STACK
ALL THE FOOD THAT YOU WANT,

01:53.480 --> 01:56.142
IT WASN'T ALISON.
WHY ARE YOU SO SURE?

01:56.180 --> 01:58.444
BECAUSE I WENT TO
HER FUNERAL TWICE.

01:58.480 --> 02:00.744
WE NEVER SAW A BODY.
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS.

02:00.780 --> 02:02.611
OKAY? YOU WERE
OXYGEN-DEPRIVED.

02:02.650 --> 02:04.447
SHE WASN'T,
AND YOU SAW HER, RIGHT?

02:06.220 --> 02:08.757
OH. SO NOW I'M THE CRAZY ONE.
GIMME MY MOZZARELLA BACK.

02:08.790 --> 02:11.679
OKAY, IT LOOKED
A LOT LIKE ALISON,
AND I'M NOT RULING IT OUT.

02:11.730 --> 02:13.493
SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT
YOU THINK HER MOM

02:13.530 --> 02:15.851
IS LAYING OUT ALL OF
HER OLD PILLOWS AND TOYS

02:15.900 --> 02:17.527
BECAUSE SHE'S EXPECTING
HER RETURN?

02:17.570 --> 02:19.492
IT WAS JUST ONE TOY. A CLOWN.

02:19.540 --> 02:21.838
GOD, EMILY, PLEASE.
NOT YOU, TOO.

02:21.870 --> 02:23.929
HEY, GUYS.
SORRY I'M LATE.

02:23.970 --> 02:26.905
SO I'VE BEEN THINKING A LOT
ABOUT THE ALISON QUESTION.

02:26.940 --> 02:32.173
REALLY? I'VE BEEN THINKING
A LOT ABOUT HOW YOU PUT MY MOM'S
PHONE IN WILDEN'S CASKET.

02:32.220 --> 02:33.915
NICE.

02:36.220 --> 02:39.417
WHAT ELSE DO I HAVE TO DO
TO PROVE TO YOU THAT
WE'RE IN THIS TOGETHER?

02:39.460 --> 02:41.485
I GAVE YOU THAT CHIP
FROM HIS DASH CAM,

02:41.520 --> 02:44.489
YOU WERE ALL THERE
WHEN MY COMPUTER WAS HACKED--

02:44.530 --> 02:46.919
I HAVE CASHED IN ALL OF MY
"GET OUT OF HELL FREE" CARDS,

02:46.960 --> 02:49.394
SO IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME
AND YOU STILL THINK
I'M KEEPING SECRETS,

02:49.430 --> 02:52.695
GO OUT THERE
AND SEARCH THAT RV
FOR YOURSELVES.

02:54.500 --> 02:56.161
WHAT?

02:57.770 --> 03:00.637
LEAD THE WAY. WE'LL FOLLOW.

03:02.880 --> 03:05.201
WHY ARE WE DOING THIS NOW?
BECAUSE IF WE WAIT UNTIL LATER

03:05.250 --> 03:07.377
SHE CAN GET BACK HERE
BEFORE US AND PURGE.

03:07.420 --> 03:09.411
( hooting )
WHAT WAS THAT?

03:09.450 --> 03:12.180
IT WAS A BIRD. A BEAVER.
DO YOU NEED TO WAIT IN THE CAR?

03:19.930 --> 03:22.865
I'M JUST SAYING I DON'T
EVEN KNOW WHAT WE'RE
SUPPOSED TO BE LOOKING FOR.

03:33.980 --> 03:35.299
OH, MY GOD.

03:37.480 --> 03:38.902
OH, MY GOD, IT'S GONE.

03:38.950 --> 03:40.269
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
IT'S GONE?

03:41.950 --> 03:43.679
THIS IS WHERE I LEFI' IT.

03:43.720 --> 03:46.883
I MEAN, YOU SAW ME, HANNA.

03:46.920 --> 03:50.356
I HAVEN'T BEEN
BACK HERE SINCE.
I SWEAR.

03:51.490 --> 03:53.822
SOMEBODY STOLE IT.
SOMEBODY?

03:55.430 --> 03:57.261
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

04:01.670 --> 04:03.729
THAT SOMEBODY
WASN'T ME!

04:14.980 --> 04:16.345
WAIT.

04:16.390 --> 04:17.448
( car doors shutting )

04:17.490 --> 04:19.515
( car starts )

04:33.570 --> 04:36.266
( starts car)

04:39.780 --> 04:41.805
( choking )

04:42.810 --> 04:44.573
( grunting )

04:44.610 --> 04:46.771
WHAT'S GOING ON?

04:51.890 --> 04:53.312
( coughing )

04:56.430 --> 04:58.819
AAH! AAAH...

04:58.860 --> 04:59.895
OH, MY GOSH!
MONA!

04:59.930 --> 05:01.591
( coughing violently)
MONA!

05:01.630 --> 05:03.621
ARE YOU OKAY?

05:06.100 --> 05:07.362
GET UP.

05:12.440 --> 05:14.431
( all scream )

05:14.480 --> 05:17.779
OHH! OHH! OHH!!!

05:17.810 --> 05:20.540
* GOT A SECRET,
CAN YOU KEEP IT *

05:20.580 --> 05:22.889
* SWEAR THIS ONE YOU'LL SAVE

05:22.920 --> 05:25.411
* BETTER LOCK IT
IN YOUR POCKET *

05:25.450 --> 05:28.010
* TAKIN' THIS ONE
TO THE GRAVE *

05:28.060 --> 05:32.952
* IF I SHOW YOU THEN I KNOW
YOU WON'T TELL WHAT I SAID *

05:39.940 --> 05:42.033
( cell phone chimes )

05:44.870 --> 05:47.407
( clatter )

05:47.440 --> 05:48.998
( sighs )

05:54.080 --> 05:56.787
HEY.
HEY, STRANGER.

05:56.820 --> 05:58.685
DIDN'T EVEN HEAR YOU
COME IN LAST NIGHT.

05:58.720 --> 06:00.585
YEAH, WELL,
THE DOOR WAS CLOSED

06:00.620 --> 06:02.850
SO I JUST FIGURED
THAT YOU WERE SLEEPING.
I WAS.

06:02.890 --> 06:06.849
IT WAS A ROUGH DRIVE.
PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE
TAKEN THE TRAIN.

06:08.160 --> 06:09.627
SO, HOW WAS NEW YORK?

06:09.670 --> 06:12.389
I DIDN'T SEE MUCH OF IT.

06:12.440 --> 06:15.898
THE BANK BOOKED
A CONFERENCE ROOM
WITH NO WINDOWS.

06:15.940 --> 06:17.498
HOW ARE YOU HOLDING UP?

06:17.540 --> 06:19.701
WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

06:19.740 --> 06:22.607
IT MEANS I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU
IN A WEEK, AND I'M CURIOUS.

06:22.650 --> 06:24.106
I'M OKAY.

06:24.150 --> 06:27.039
I WENT TO THE FUNERAL.

06:27.080 --> 06:29.844
WILDEN'S.

06:29.890 --> 06:31.846
AND HOW WAS THAT?
WEIRD.

06:34.690 --> 06:36.624
I MEAN, I--
I WANTED HIM GONE,

06:36.660 --> 06:38.423
AND I'LL PROBABLY GO TO HELL
FOR SAYING THAT, BUT...

06:41.530 --> 06:43.896
MOM, YOU DON'T THINK
I HAD ANYTHING TO DO
WITH THIS, DO YOU?

06:43.930 --> 06:46.592
I MEAN, I KNOW
I WANTED HIM DEAD,
BUT YOU DON'T THINK THAT--

06:46.640 --> 06:49.768
HANNA, THAT THOUGHT
NEVER EVEN CROSSED MY MIND.

06:49.810 --> 06:52.199
WHAT DO YOU THINK
HAPPENED TO HIM?

06:52.240 --> 06:55.607
I THINK THAT DETECTIVE WILDEN
HAD MORE ENEMIES THAN FRIENDS

06:55.640 --> 07:00.646
AND I THINK ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE
DECIDED TO DO US ALL A FAVOR.

07:03.620 --> 07:05.087
USE A PLATE, PLEASE.

07:12.700 --> 07:14.224
MOM.

07:14.260 --> 07:16.023
YOU LOST YOUR PHONE.

07:18.500 --> 07:20.730
WHERE DID YOU FIND THAT?

07:20.770 --> 07:22.658
IT WAS IN THE MAILBOX.

07:22.710 --> 07:25.804
I GUESS SOMEONE
DECIDED TO RETURN IT.

07:28.010 --> 07:30.740
I MUST HAVE LEFI' IT
AT THE HOTEL DESK

07:30.780 --> 07:31.940
WHEN I WAS CHECKING OUT.

07:31.980 --> 07:35.518
MAYBE THEY
MESSENGERED IT BACK.

07:35.550 --> 07:37.245
DON'T LOOK SO SHOCKED,
HANNA.

07:37.290 --> 07:40.179
THERE ARE STILL SOME
HONEST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD.

07:46.030 --> 07:52.128
* I CAN'T UNDERSTAND
HOW THE EDGES ARE ROUGH *

07:52.170 --> 07:57.506
* AND THEY CUT YOU LIKE
THE TINIEST SLIVERS OF GLASS *

07:58.610 --> 08:01.738
* AND YOU FEEL SO MUCH

08:01.780 --> 08:06.103
* AND YOU DON'T KNOW HOW LONG
YOU'RE GONNA LAST *

08:08.780 --> 08:10.008
Aria: SHE'S A MESS.

08:10.050 --> 08:12.985
SHE CAN BARELY MOVE. HAS THIS
WICKED BRUISE ON HER SHOULDER.

08:13.020 --> 08:14.715
SHE LANDED ON
A HUGE ROCK.

08:14.760 --> 08:16.580
WHY DIDN'T SHE
LAND ON MONA?

08:16.630 --> 08:18.951
HANNA, THE CAR TRIED
TO FLA'I'I'EN ME AND MONA.

08:18.990 --> 08:21.049
EMILY HADN'T JUMPED IN
WE WOULD HAVE BEEN ROAD KILL.

08:21.100 --> 08:24.126
SERIOUSLY, IF "A's" NEW PLAN
IS TO TRY TO PICK OFF
THE TINY ONES IN THE HERD--

08:24.170 --> 08:26.092
OKAY, WE ARE NOT A HERD.
IT'S AN EXPRESSION.

08:26.130 --> 08:28.166
YEAH, FOR COWS.
WELL, I'VE BEEN CRATED.

08:28.200 --> 08:30.134
WHAT DOES THAT MAKE ME?

08:30.170 --> 08:32.877
MY MOM DIDN'T EVEN BLINK
WHEN I PULLED HER PHONE OUT.

08:32.910 --> 08:34.878
IT WAS LIKE
SHE KNEW IT WAS STOLEN

08:34.910 --> 08:37.606
AND SHE WAS JUST WAITING
FOR ME TO SPILL.

08:37.650 --> 08:40.141
IT'S NOT GONNA HELP YOU
OR YOUR MOM TO TELL HER
THAT "A" IS BACK.

08:40.180 --> 08:41.875
YEAH, AND FRAMING HER
FOR A MURDER.

08:41.920 --> 08:44.081
SO WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
TO DO NOW, NOTHING?

08:44.120 --> 08:46.657
I MEAN, IF MONA
DIDN'T PUT THAT PHONE
IN THE CASKET,

08:46.690 --> 08:49.625
THEN WHO DID? AND WHO SENT
THAT TAPE OF US OUTSIDE
OF WILDEN'S CAR?

08:49.660 --> 08:51.787
AND WHO STOLE
MONA'S HATE-MOBILE?

08:51.830 --> 08:54.298
MELISSA? JENNA? SHANA?

08:54.330 --> 08:56.992
YOU COULD ALWAYS
GO ASK HER YOURSELF.

09:01.270 --> 09:03.830
HAN, I WASN'T
SERIOUS. HANNA.

09:05.670 --> 09:09.106
HEY. YOU SAVIN' THAT SEAT
FOR YOUR GAL-PAL JENNA?

09:09.140 --> 09:12.041
EXCUSE ME?
DON'T ACT LIKE YOU HAVEN'T
HEARD THAT NAME BEFORE.

09:12.080 --> 09:15.641
JEN-NA. WHY'D YOU SKIP
WILDEN'S FUNERAL?

09:15.680 --> 09:17.910
HANNA.
JENNA WAS THERE.
WHY WEREN'T YOU?

09:17.950 --> 09:19.952
YOU THREE WERE
ALL BUDS, RIGHT?

09:19.990 --> 09:22.254
WHERE WERE YOU YESTERDAY?
I WAS AT SWIM PRACTICE,

09:22.290 --> 09:23.848
BUT I DON'T RECALL
SIGNING A CONTRACT

09:23.890 --> 09:26.051
THAT SAID I HAD TO
REPORT THAT TO YOU.
HANNA, LET'S GO.

09:26.090 --> 09:27.751
SO SWIMMING LAPS
WAS MORE IMPORTANT

09:27.800 --> 09:28.892
THAN SAYING GOOD-BYE
TO AN OLD FRIEND?

09:28.930 --> 09:30.295
WHAT OLD FRIEND?

09:30.330 --> 09:32.059
THE GROGGY SCUMBAG
YOU AND JENNA

09:32.100 --> 09:34.193
SCRAPED OFF THE ROAD
THE NIGHT HE WAS HIT BY A CAR.

09:34.240 --> 09:36.561
HANNA, COME ON.

09:42.340 --> 09:45.946
HEY. GOT YOUR TEXT.
WHAT'D YOU WANT TO SHOW ME?

09:45.980 --> 09:47.948
YOUR FUTURE DORM ROOM.

09:47.980 --> 09:49.948
OR SHOULD I SAY "OURS."

09:49.990 --> 09:53.915
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
I LIKE.

09:53.960 --> 09:55.780
SERIOUSLY?

09:55.820 --> 09:57.959
I WAS GOING FOR COZY,
BUT THEN IT LOOKED LIKE COZY

09:57.990 --> 09:59.821
WAS ONE PUFFY DRAPE
AWAY FROM "GREY GARDENS."

09:59.860 --> 10:02.090
PAIGE, SLOW DOWN.

10:02.130 --> 10:05.019
I HAVEN'T EVEN HEARD
FROM THE STANFORD COACH.

10:05.070 --> 10:07.265
THEY'RE GONNA WANT YOU.

10:07.300 --> 10:10.337
MAYBE NOT AS MUCH AS I DO,
BUT THAT'S A GOOD THING.

10:13.980 --> 10:17.108
OKAY, TRUTH.
WHAT WOULD YOU CHANGE?

10:17.150 --> 10:19.072
WELL, I, UM...

10:19.110 --> 10:21.340
I'D PUSH THE BEDS
A LITTLE CLOSER TOGETHER.

10:26.420 --> 10:28.115
WHAT'S WRONG?

10:28.160 --> 10:29.787
UM, NOTHING.

10:29.830 --> 10:31.980
I...SLEPT WEIRD.

10:32.030 --> 10:34.225
MIGHT NOT BE ABLE
TO SWIM TOMORROW.

10:34.260 --> 10:37.058
WHAT?! EM!
YOU HAVE TO SWIM TOMORROW.

10:37.100 --> 10:38.067
IT'LL BE FINE.

10:38.100 --> 10:40.398
IT'S JUST A LITTLE BIT
MORE STIFF THAN ANYTHING.

10:40.440 --> 10:42.806
UM, SHOW ME
THOSE PUFFY DRAPES.

10:50.080 --> 10:53.140
( door opens,
closes in distance )

10:57.720 --> 10:59.142
HEY.
HEY.

10:59.190 --> 11:00.851
WHY DIDN'T YOU
WANT TO COME UP?

11:00.890 --> 11:03.859
WHAT? OH, I HAD TO
RETURN éHMESSAGE.

11:04.860 --> 11:06.725
YOU READY?
UM...

11:06.760 --> 11:07.897
ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

11:07.930 --> 11:10.160
I WAS THINKING
OF BAGGING SCHOOL TODAY.

11:10.200 --> 11:12.168
DO YOU WANT TO GO
GET SOME BREAKFAST?

11:12.200 --> 11:14.839
I CAN'T. I HAVE TO
GET TO A JOB TODAY.

11:14.870 --> 11:16.758
I THOUGHT IT STARTED
ON MONDAY.

11:16.810 --> 11:19.461
I HAVE TO BE ON-SITE TODAY.

11:19.510 --> 11:22.843
( cell phone rings )
TOBY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

11:22.880 --> 11:25.440
WHY DON'T YOU WANT TO
ANSWER A PHONE CALL?

11:27.250 --> 11:29.844
HEY, WHAT HAPPENED TO
NEVER KEEPING SECRETS
FROM EACH OTHER AGAIN?

11:29.890 --> 11:33.951
I AM NOT KEEPING SECRETS.
LET'S GO, SPENCER.

11:33.990 --> 11:35.719
MONA WAS ATTACKED
LAST NIGHT.

11:35.760 --> 11:37.978
WE FOLLOWED HER OUT
TO WHERE SHE PARKED THE RV,

11:38.030 --> 11:40.453
IT'S GONE. AND WHEN MONA
GOT BACK INTO HER CAR,

11:40.500 --> 11:42.821
"A" OR SOMEBODY
TRIED TO KILL HER.

11:45.000 --> 11:48.390
WHY DOES THIS NOT SEEM
LIKE BREAKING NEWS TO YOU?

11:48.440 --> 11:50.203
BECAUSE I HAVE TO GO.

11:50.240 --> 11:53.368
OKAY? WE CAN TALK
ABOUT THIS LATER.

11:59.380 --> 12:00.210
Ezra: SO, TACKLE THE LAST
FOUR CHAPTERS,

12:01.880 --> 12:03.814
WE'LL GO OVER THE HISTORICAL
CONTEXT ON MONDAY,

12:03.850 --> 12:05.283
AND FOR THOSE OF YOU
WHO ARE AHEAD,

12:05.320 --> 12:07.481
AND CAN'T ENOUGH
OF DOOMED ROMANCE,

12:07.520 --> 12:11.058
UM, PICK UP "EAST OF EDEN"
FOR EXTRA CREDIT.

12:11.090 --> 12:12.955
( bell rings )

12:17.470 --> 12:19.859
SPENCE, YOU COMIN'?

12:19.900 --> 12:21.959
UH, YEAH. I'LL CATCH UP
TO YOU GUYS AT LUNCH.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.002
OKAY, WE'LL MEET YOU
IN THE COURTYARD.

12:33.580 --> 12:36.048
YOlU OKAY, SPENCER?

12:36.080 --> 12:38.048
YEAH.

12:40.920 --> 12:43.354
I, UM...

12:43.390 --> 12:47.053
I HEARD FROM UPenn
THIS MORNING...

12:47.100 --> 12:50.263
(voice breaking)
AND I DIDN'T GET IN.

12:50.300 --> 12:52.837
I'M SORRY.

12:52.870 --> 12:54.360
I'M SORRY, UH...

12:54.400 --> 12:56.459
ARE THERE ANY OTHER SCHOOLS--

12:56.500 --> 12:58.866
NOT FOR MY FAMILY, NO.

12:58.910 --> 13:02.175
I'LL BE THE FIRST ONE
NOT TO GO.

13:03.910 --> 13:06.572
SORRY. I, UM, I HAVEN'T
TOLD MY PARENTS,

13:06.610 --> 13:08.544
AND I HAVEN'T EVEN
TOLD MY FRIENDS.

13:08.580 --> 13:10.480
I DON'T REALLY KNOW
WHY I TOLD YOU,

13:10.520 --> 13:12.044
SO I'D JUST REALLY
APPRECIATE IT IF YOU--

13:12.090 --> 13:13.955
NO, NO. NO.
I WON'T SAY A WORD.

13:17.330 --> 13:21.289
I'VE ACTUALLY BEEN ASKED
TO HELP OUT WITH COLLEGE ESSAYS,

13:21.330 --> 13:24.891
SO WHEN YOU'RE READY
TO THINK OF OTHER SCHOOLS,
I'M HERE FOR YOU.

13:24.930 --> 13:28.195
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT
TO HAVE A SECOND CHOICE,

13:28.240 --> 13:32.267
EVEN IF YOU HAD
YOUR HEART SET ON
SOMETHING ELSE.

13:32.310 --> 13:37.247
IF I WERE YOU, I WOULD
ACTUALLY APPLY TO OTHER
SCHOOLS RIGHT AWAY.

13:37.280 --> 13:41.979
AND YOU CAN EMAIL ME THE ESSAY
AND MAYBE WE CAN WORK ON IT
OVER THE WEEKEND.

13:43.520 --> 13:45.181
THAN KS.

13:45.220 --> 13:47.518
HEY, SPENCER.

13:47.560 --> 13:49.812
IT'S THEIR LOSS.

13:53.460 --> 13:56.998
Hanna:
WHAT'S KEEPING YOU
FROM SAYING SOMETHING?

13:57.030 --> 13:58.588
SHE SPENT A WHOLE SUMMER
DATING HER.

13:58.630 --> 14:01.064
Emily: LEAVE PAIGE OUT OF IT.
SHE'S ALREADY IN IT, EM.

14:01.100 --> 14:04.228
SHE KNOWS SHANA
BETTER THAN ANY OF US.

14:04.270 --> 14:07.899
WHAT WAS THAT?
I'M TRYING TO FIND
A HEATING PAD.

14:07.940 --> 14:09.498
IS YOUR SHOULDER WORSE?

14:09.540 --> 14:11.542
I NEARLY FAINTED
AFTER PAIGE'S HUG.

14:11.580 --> 14:13.047
YOU DIDN'T TELL HER?
NO.

14:13.080 --> 14:14.809
I'M NOT GONNA PUT HER
ON "A's" HIT LIST AGAIN.

14:14.850 --> 14:19.219
(sighs) WELL, I MEAN,
ARE YOU GONNA BE OKAY TOMORROW?
DON'T YOU HAVE A BIG SWIM MEET?

14:19.250 --> 14:23.084
OKAY, CAN WE NOT USE
"BIG" AND "MEET" IN
THE SAME SENTENCE?

14:23.130 --> 14:25.257
MAYBE YOU CAN WEAR
A SWIMSUIT WITH SLEEVES.

14:25.290 --> 14:29.192
I MEAN, I SPENT
TWO SUMMERS AT FAT CAMP
SWIMMING IN A PARKA.

14:29.230 --> 14:32.119
EM? ARE YOU GONNA
BE ABLE TO SWIM?

14:32.170 --> 14:34.229
I DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.

14:37.510 --> 14:39.466
WEIRD.

14:39.510 --> 14:41.978
NO, IT'S NOT.
I HAVE TO BREAK RECORDS.

14:42.010 --> 14:44.171
STANFORD WANTS--
NO. NOT THAT.

14:44.210 --> 14:49.045
MY...MY MOM TRIED CLEANING
HER MANOLOS WITH A TOOTHBRUSH.

14:49.080 --> 14:51.344
IF IT'S NOT YOUR TOOTHBRUSH,
WHY DO YOU CARE?

14:51.390 --> 14:54.416
THEY'RE SILK. WHY WOULDN'T SHE
JUST TAKE THEM TO THE CLEANERS?

14:54.460 --> 14:56.451
MAYBE SHE'S TRYING
TO SAVE MONEY.

14:56.490 --> 14:58.151
LOOK, I HAVE TO GO.
PAIGE IS COMING SOON.

14:58.190 --> 14:59.999
NO, SHE SAID SHE WAS
HOLED UP ALL WEEK.

15:00.030 --> 15:02.396
HOW MUDDY DOES
A HOTEL LOBBY GET?

15:02.430 --> 15:04.625
WE'LL TALK LATER.
( srghs )

15:09.640 --> 15:11.301
( doorbell rings )

15:27.460 --> 15:28.688
CAN I HELP YOU?

15:31.190 --> 15:33.693
HI. YEAH, DOES HOLDEN STRAUSS
TEACH HERE?

15:33.730 --> 15:35.129
HE'S NOT HERE ON FRIDAYS.

15:35.160 --> 15:36.422
HE USED TO THE WORD "TEACH"?

15:36.460 --> 15:41.261
WELL, I KNOW THAT HE JUST
LIKES TO COME HERE TO FIGHT
AND STUFF.

15:41.300 --> 15:44.167
HE DOES.
BUT LAST TIME I CHECKED,
I WAS STILL THE TEACHER.

15:44.210 --> 15:47.008
SORRY. I DON'T MEAN TO BE RUDE.
YOU'RE NOT.

15:47.040 --> 15:49.577
HOLDEN IS. I'M JAKE.

15:49.610 --> 15:52.272
HI. DO YOU TEACH
PRIVATELY?

15:52.310 --> 15:54.540
WHEN WOULD YOU LIKE TO START?
TODAY.

15:54.580 --> 15:56.548
OR TOMORROW. JUST SOON.

15:56.580 --> 15:59.014
SOUNDS URGENT. YOU THINKING
ABOUT JUMPING INTO A GANG?

15:59.050 --> 16:01.052
( laughs ) NO.

16:01.090 --> 16:04.025
I JUST HAVE A BUNCH OF SCHOOL
STUFF COMING UP NEXT MONTH.

16:07.500 --> 16:09.525
I'LL BE HERE.

16:09.560 --> 16:13.189
CAN YOU GIVE ME A NAME,
OR DO YOU JUST GO BY
"HOLDEN'S FRIEND"?

16:17.210 --> 16:20.008
OH, SORRY. IT WAS SO QUIET
I THOUGHT YOU WERE SLEEPING.

16:20.040 --> 16:23.339
I HAVE TO FINISH THIS
BY MONDAY.
HOW'S IT GOING?

16:23.380 --> 16:24.677
HOW DO YOU THINK IT'S GOING?

16:24.710 --> 16:27.611
LAST BOOK I FINISHED WAS
"THE VERY HUNGRY CATERPILLAR."

16:27.650 --> 16:31.188
WELL, I WON'T DISTURB YOU.

16:31.220 --> 16:34.610
MOM, DID YOU LEAVE YOUR MANOLOS
IN A BAG UNDER THE SINK?

16:34.660 --> 16:37.356
WHAT ABOUT THEM?
NOTHING.

16:37.390 --> 16:39.585
HOW'D THEY GET SO TRASHED?

16:39.630 --> 16:42.190
DID YOU GO ON A HIKE
THROUGH CENTRAL PARK?

16:42.230 --> 16:44.391
WHY ARE YOU WORRYING
ABOUT MY CLOTHES

16:44.430 --> 16:46.227
WHEN YOU CAN'T FIND THE STRENGTH
TO HANG UP YOUR OWN?

16:46.270 --> 16:48.465
I'M JUST CURIOUS.

16:48.500 --> 16:50.604
I KNOW THAT YOU
LOVE THOSE SHOES--

16:50.640 --> 16:52.505
THEY'RE JUST SHOES,
HANNA.

16:52.540 --> 16:54.633
FINISH YOUR BOOK.
AND GET SOME SLEEP.

17:07.090 --> 17:11.356
HEY, SPENCE, IT'S ME AGAIN.
WHY HAVEN'T YOU CALLED ME BACK?

17:11.390 --> 17:14.325
AND WHERE ARE YOU
ON A SATURDAY MORNING
AT TEN O'CLOCK?

17:14.360 --> 17:16.328
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

17:16.360 --> 17:18.260
Jessica: HAN NA?

17:22.800 --> 17:25.109
I THOUGHT THAT WAS YOU.

17:25.140 --> 17:26.698
HI, MRS. DiLAURENTIS.

17:28.280 --> 17:31.147
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

17:31.180 --> 17:32.807
GOOD.

17:32.850 --> 17:35.148
YOU'VE BEEN DOING
A LOT OF WORK.

17:35.180 --> 17:38.445
WELL, EVERYTHING I DID YESTERDAY
WAS UNDONE BY AN ANGRY RACCOON,

17:38.490 --> 17:41.084
OR WHATEVER'S LIVING
UNDER THAT PORCH.

17:42.390 --> 17:44.551
CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?

17:44.590 --> 17:47.718
IF I FILL THAT AREA IN
WITH ICEBERG ROSES,

17:47.760 --> 17:50.558
WILL IT MAKE THE GRAY SHINGLES
LOOK STODGY?

17:50.600 --> 17:53.694
UM, I DON'T...REALLY
HAVE AN OPINION.

17:53.740 --> 17:55.093
REALLY?

17:55.140 --> 17:57.631
GOD KNOWS ALISON WOULD.

17:57.670 --> 18:01.299
I'LL CLUMP THE WHITES
OVER HERE...

18:01.340 --> 18:03.740
(voice in distance )

18:03.780 --> 18:05.247
WHAT WAS THAT?

18:05.280 --> 18:08.579
THAT? THAT WAS A GIFT
FROM MY LATE MOTHER-IN-LAW.

18:08.620 --> 18:12.078
COME. MEET TIPPI.

18:14.490 --> 18:16.412
Voice: I CAN'T KEEP COMING BACK.

18:16.460 --> 18:18.781
IT'S UNCANNY, ISN'T IT?

18:20.700 --> 18:22.850
CAREFUL WHAT YOU SAY
AROUND HER.

18:22.900 --> 18:25.323
( parrot squawks )
IT MAY COME BACK TO HAUNT YOU.

18:25.370 --> 18:27.736
WANT A SWEET POTATO?
NO, TIPPI,

18:27.770 --> 18:32.207
WE DON'T. I'M GUESSING
MOTHER D ASKED HER THAT
FIFTY TIMES A DAY.

18:32.240 --> 18:34.731
MISS ME?

18:34.780 --> 18:37.203
GOD, SHE SOUNDS
JUST LIKE ALI.

18:37.250 --> 18:38.501
WHEN SHE WENT TO GEORGIA,

18:38.550 --> 18:41.610
SHE SPENT MORE TIME
WITH THAT BIRD THAN
SHE DID HER GRANDMOTHER.

18:41.650 --> 18:43.743
THEY SHARED A ROOM.

18:43.790 --> 18:46.918
DON'T WORRY, SWEETIE,
I DON'T THINK SHE TAUGHT HER
"HEFTY HANNA."

18:46.950 --> 18:49.111
( parrot chattering )

18:52.760 --> 18:57.493
IT WAS KIND OF
A WEIRD QUESTION FOR
A COLLEGE ESSAY.

18:57.530 --> 19:01.466
"DISCUSS ONE SITUATION
IN WHICH YOU WERE RIGHT
AND WISH YOU HADN'T BEEN."

19:01.500 --> 19:03.229
I COULD NAME TEN.

19:03.270 --> 19:06.808
WELL, YOUR HIGH SCHOOL
EXPERIENCE HASN'T BEEN
EXACTLY TYPICAL.

19:06.840 --> 19:08.933
YOU HATED IT.

19:08.980 --> 19:10.743
NO. NO.

19:10.780 --> 19:12.771
I THOUGHT IT WAS
VERY WELL WRITTEN,

19:12.810 --> 19:14.516
I THOUGHT IT WAS
VERY MOVING,

19:14.550 --> 19:17.212
I JUST...QUESTION

19:17.250 --> 19:20.481
WHETHER THIS IS SOMETHING
YOU'D WANT TO SHARE WITH
AN ADMISSIONS COMMITTEE.

19:20.520 --> 19:22.715
WHY?

19:22.760 --> 19:26.787
I THINK COLLEGES NOW
MORE THAN EVER ARE CONCERNED
WITH EMOTIONAL STABILITY,

19:26.830 --> 19:30.288
AND CHOOSING WHAT TO REVEAL
AND WHAT TO KEEP UNDER WRAPS--

19:30.330 --> 19:32.491
WHAT SHOULD I KEEP
UNDER WRAPS?

19:32.530 --> 19:34.862
A FRIEND OF MINE
WAS MURDERED.

19:34.900 --> 19:37.733
I WAS BULLIED. I DID
HAVE A MENTAL BREAKDOWN.

19:37.770 --> 19:40.273
RIGHT, BUT NOBODY'S
ASKING FOR FULL DISCLOSURE.

19:40.310 --> 19:44.303
I THINK SUBMITTING THIS AS-IS
WOULD BE A HUGE MISTAKE.

19:45.710 --> 19:47.678
LOOK, SPENCER,

19:47.720 --> 19:49.517
IF YOU THROW THIS ALL OUT THERE,

19:49.550 --> 19:53.281
YOUR MANY ATTRACTIVE QUALITIES
MIGHT BE OVERSHADOWED.

19:53.320 --> 19:56.357
HONESTY MAY NOT BE
THE BEST POLICY.

19:56.390 --> 19:58.426
SO YOU WANT ME TO PRETEND
TO BE SOMEBODY THAT I'M NOT.

19:58.460 --> 20:00.519
NO. BUT YOU ARE
MORE THAN THIS.

20:00.560 --> 20:02.926
YEAH, BUT I WOULDN'T BE
IF IT WEREN'T FOR THAT.

20:02.960 --> 20:05.929
I MEAN, WHY CAN'T I JUST
TAKE A RISK AND BE REAL

20:05.970 --> 20:08.939
AND, I DON'T KNOW,
HAVE A LITTLE FAITH THAT
MAYBE SOMEBODY WHO READS THIS

20:08.970 --> 20:11.268
WILL ACTUALLY BE IMPRESSED
THAT I LEFT RADLEY,

20:11.310 --> 20:13.778
THAT I'M NOT STILL THERE
MAKING CRAFTS OUT OF
UNCOOKED MACARONI.

20:13.810 --> 20:16.836
SPENCER, 1--
WHEN HAS BEING DISHONEST
EVER HELPED ME?

20:16.880 --> 20:19.576
OR YOU? OR ANYONE?

20:20.880 --> 20:23.280
OOH!
( chuckles )

20:23.320 --> 20:25.288
I THINK WE'RE
MOVIN' TOO FAST.

20:25.320 --> 20:27.015
AND I'M GUESSIN'
THAT HURT.

20:27.050 --> 20:28.950
YEAH, IT DID A LITTLE.

20:28.990 --> 20:31.322
BUT IT ACTUALLY FELT
PRETTY GOOD.

20:31.360 --> 20:32.725
LET'S TAKE A BREATH.

20:32.760 --> 20:34.694
REVIEW OUR POSITIONS,
GO OVER BASIC BLOCKS.

20:34.730 --> 20:37.699
OKAY. WE'LL GET BACK
TO THE KICKING, RIGHT?
I REALLY LIKE THE KICKING.

20:37.730 --> 20:39.027
(laughs) ARIA...

20:39.070 --> 20:41.891
TANG SOO DO IS ABOUT DEFENSE,
NOT OFFENSE.

20:41.940 --> 20:45.501
NO, I UNDERSTAND,
BUT WHAT IF SOMEBODY
ATTACKS ME FROM BEHIND?

20:45.540 --> 20:48.008
HOLD UP. IS THIS
A REAL CONCERN?

20:48.040 --> 20:50.679
IS SOMEONE
THREATENING YOU?
NO, NOT RIGHT NOW.

20:50.710 --> 20:52.769
LOOK, I'M SMALL, OKAY?

20:52.810 --> 20:54.368
PEOPLE LOOK AT ME
AS AN EASY TARGET.

20:54.420 --> 20:55.876
IT'S A LAW OF
THE UNIVERSE, RIGHT?

20:58.620 --> 21:00.713
OKAY, ARE MY FEET
FAR ENOUGH APART?

21:05.830 --> 21:07.821
THEY'RE PERFECT.

21:12.070 --> 21:14.994
ARIA...
THIS RELATIONSHIP DOESN'T WORK

21:15.040 --> 21:17.838
UNLESS THERE'S A LEVEL
OF TRUST BETWEEN US.

21:17.870 --> 21:19.758
DO YOU TRUST ME?

21:21.380 --> 21:23.701
UH, DON'T REALLY KNOW YOU.

21:23.750 --> 21:24.899
TRUE.

21:24.950 --> 21:27.510
BUT THE BEST WAY
YOU CAN FIND OUT
IF YOU CAN TRUST SOMEBODY

21:27.550 --> 21:29.040
IS TO TRUST THEM.

21:29.080 --> 21:32.345
SOMETIMES.

21:34.620 --> 21:37.487
LOOK, I'M NOT SOME SCARY
BALL OF PARANOIA,
OKAY?

21:37.530 --> 21:38.781
I'VE JUST GOT A LOT OF STUFF
GOING ON.

21:38.830 --> 21:40.718
I JUST RECENTLY
BROKE UP WITH MY BOYFRIEND--

21:40.760 --> 21:43.866
IS THAT WHO
YOU'RE AFRAID OF?

21:43.900 --> 21:45.367
NO.

21:46.770 --> 21:49.466
NO, I'M NOT AFRAID,
I JUST...

21:52.570 --> 21:54.936
I DON'T KNOW,
I JUST FEEL--
ANGRY.

21:54.980 --> 21:57.574
FEELING POWERLESS.

21:58.810 --> 22:01.415
AREN'T YOU?

22:01.450 --> 22:05.511
WE CAN'T DEFEND OURSELVES
UNTIL WE FEEL SAFE
IN OUR OWN SKIN.

22:06.520 --> 22:08.385
DO YOU...

22:08.420 --> 22:10.456
FEEL SAFE IN YOUR OWN SKIN?

22:17.730 --> 22:18.890
NO.

22:20.470 --> 22:21.767
BUT YOU WILL.

22:24.770 --> 22:26.032
Hanna: MRS. DiLAURENTIS,

22:26.070 --> 22:27.901
WHEN THE POLICE FOUND ALI'S--

22:27.940 --> 22:29.373
THE POLICE DIDN'T FIND HER.

22:29.410 --> 22:32.106
IT WAS WORKERS
TEARING DOWN THE GAZEBO.

22:32.150 --> 22:36.109
RIGHT. BUT ONCE
THE POLICE WERE CALLED,

22:36.150 --> 22:38.380
DID YOU SEE--

22:38.420 --> 22:41.082
SEE WHAT?
WHAT WAS LEFT OF HER?

22:42.760 --> 22:45.456
THE YELLOW BLOUSE
WAS ENOUGH, HANNA.

22:46.890 --> 22:48.892
DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU WOULD LIKE?

22:48.930 --> 22:51.694
I'LL HAVE
WHATEVER YOU'RE HAVING.
EXCEPT FOR THE BLOODY MARY.

22:51.730 --> 22:53.789
I'M NOT ORDERING
A COCKTAIL.

22:53.840 --> 22:56.866
GO FOR IT.
I WON'T TELL DAD.

23:00.210 --> 23:02.974
MAYBE A SMALL
GLASS OF CHABLIS.

23:04.910 --> 23:06.969
ALI, YOU'VE GOT TO
TAKE MY WORD ON THIS.

23:07.010 --> 23:08.648
THAT TOP WAS
WAY TOO REVEALING.

23:08.680 --> 23:10.784
I'M HAPPY WITH
THE YELLOW ONE.

23:13.520 --> 23:16.114
WOULD IT BE OKAY
IF I STAYED DOWN THE SHORE
TILL TUESDAY?

23:16.160 --> 23:18.481
BY YOURSELF? NO.

23:18.530 --> 23:21.055
I WON'T BE ALONE.
WHEN AND DADDY LEAVE,

23:21.100 --> 23:22.897
ARIA AND SPENCER
WILL TAKE THE TRAIN DOWN.

23:22.930 --> 23:24.727
AND HANNA WANTS TO COME TOO.

23:24.770 --> 23:27.091
SO YOU'VE ALREADY
INVITED THEM.

23:27.130 --> 23:28.438
SORT OF.

23:28.470 --> 23:30.563
LOOK, WE NEED
A MAJOR SLEEPOVER.

23:30.610 --> 23:31.963
AND WHY CAN'T THAT
HAPPEN HERE?

23:32.010 --> 23:33.034
BECAUSE IT WOULD SUCK.

23:33.070 --> 23:35.675
ARIA AND EMILY WOULD FIND
SOME EXCUSE TO LEAVE,

23:35.710 --> 23:38.042
THEN SPENCER WILL SNEAK OUT
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.

23:38.080 --> 23:41.516
AND HANNA'S CREEPED OUT
BY JASON. HE STARES
AT HER CHEST.

23:41.550 --> 23:46.214
I'M SORRY. I'M JUST NOT BIG
ON LEAVING FIVE TEENAGERS
IN A CAPE MAY BEACH RENTAL.

23:46.250 --> 23:48.980
PLEASE, MOM.
WE NEED THIS.

23:49.020 --> 23:51.454
OUR GROUP'S FALLING APART,
AND SUMMER'S ALMOST OVER--

23:51.490 --> 23:54.857
ALISON, TAKE NO
FOR AN ANSWER.

23:56.160 --> 23:58.128
PLEASE.

23:58.170 --> 24:00.422
I THINK WE SHOULD SHARE
THE GREEK SALAD.

24:04.570 --> 24:05.798
IT'S BIG ENOUGH FOR TWO.

24:07.240 --> 24:08.798
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

24:08.840 --> 24:12.003
ALISON, DON'T. IT'S BEEN
QUITE A MORNING ALREADY.

24:13.250 --> 24:16.845
DO YOU HEAR ME?
DON'T DO THIS HERE.

24:21.590 --> 24:24.479
I WILL LEAVE YOU
AT THIS TABLE.

24:24.530 --> 24:26.725
I MEAN IT.

24:26.760 --> 24:29.649
I'LL LET YOU LAND
FACE-FIRST ON THE SIDEWALK.

24:29.700 --> 24:32.521
ALISON, BREATHE.

24:35.800 --> 24:38.030
I SAID, BREATHE.

24:40.880 --> 24:42.131
BREATHE!!!

24:45.610 --> 24:47.840
OKAY, FINE. ONE NIGHT.

24:49.020 --> 24:50.783
( exhales )

24:55.090 --> 24:59.083
SHE PERFECT ED THAT STUNT
WHEN SHE WAS FIVE YEARS OLD--
JUST TO TORTURE ME.

24:59.130 --> 25:02.122
ALI NEVER INVITED US
TO CAPE MAY THAT SUMMER.

25:02.160 --> 25:04.560
I'M NOT SURPRISED.

25:04.600 --> 25:06.591
ALL THE EMPTY BEER BOTTLES
THAT I FOUND LATER

25:06.630 --> 25:08.860
MADE ME WONDER IF SHE WAS
RUNNING WITH AN OLDER CROWD.

25:08.900 --> 25:10.902
PROBABLY A BOY.

25:10.940 --> 25:13.204
( parrot whistles )

25:14.780 --> 25:16.907
YOU KNOW ANYBODY
WHO WANTS A BIRD?

25:16.940 --> 25:19.170
I HAVE ENOUGH VOICES
IN MY HEAD.

25:21.680 --> 25:23.819
( whistling )

25:25.790 --> 25:27.143
NOW PUSH UP.

25:27.190 --> 25:30.079
SLOWLY TURN TO FACE ME
AND STEP THROUGH.

25:31.190 --> 25:32.623
STEP THROUGH.

25:32.660 --> 25:33.752
S-SLOWLY.

25:33.800 --> 25:35.688
THAT'S IT.
COOL.

25:35.730 --> 25:36.754
LET'S TRY IT AGAIN.

25:36.800 --> 25:39.098
( timer rings )
WHAT'S THAT?

25:39.130 --> 25:41.894
OUR TIME'S UP,
BUT LET'S KEEP GOING.

25:41.940 --> 25:43.032
ONCE MORE.
OKAY.

25:47.740 --> 25:49.139
THERE YOU GO.

25:49.180 --> 25:50.875
YOU'VE GOT IT.

25:52.050 --> 25:54.177
THAT'S--
THAT'S PERFECT.

25:54.220 --> 25:56.939
HOW DO YOU FEEL?
IN CONTROL?

26:03.360 --> 26:05.180
I AM SO SORRY.
NO, UH--

26:05.230 --> 26:07.186
I HAVE NO IDEA WHY
I JUST DID THAT.

26:07.230 --> 26:09.892
IT'S FINE. I--
I DON'T THINK THAT'S
WHAT YOU CAME HERE FOR--

26:09.930 --> 26:11.329
NO, I DIDN'T.

26:11.370 --> 26:13.691
I DIDN'T.
I'LL SEE YOU TUESDAY.

26:17.240 --> 26:18.662
( alarm remote chirps )

26:23.980 --> 26:25.800
UHHH!

26:25.850 --> 26:27.715
STUPID.

26:28.820 --> 26:29.844
( deep sigh )

26:49.400 --> 26:51.868
( horn honking )

26:57.340 --> 26:58.375
Mona: I JUST--

26:58.410 --> 27:01.140
MONA!
HURRY, WE'RE LATE.

27:02.420 --> 27:04.012
LET'S GO, MONA.
GET IN.

27:18.200 --> 27:19.428
Mona: HE WAS A DECOY, ARIA.
I WAS TUNED IN TO
THE COPS BEHIND HIM.

27:22.870 --> 27:25.862
YOU CAN'T BE CHATTING UP
ANY COPS IN BROAD DAYLIGHT,
MONA.

27:25.910 --> 27:27.878
IF I CAN SEE YOU,
SO CAN "A."

27:27.910 --> 27:29.434
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO
PAY FOR THIS---

27:29.480 --> 27:31.971
STOP TALKING TO ME
LIKE I'M A BUCKET OF ROCKS.

27:32.010 --> 27:34.808
I'M SCOPING THIS OUT
FOR ALL OF US.

27:34.850 --> 27:37.887
WHAT YOU SHOULD BE ASKING
IS WHAT I OVERHEARD BEFORE
YOU SCREECHED UP

27:37.920 --> 27:40.138
LIKE CHICKEN FRICKIN' LITTLE.

27:40.190 --> 27:43.114
THOSE DUDES BEHIND HIM
WERE SPECIAL INVESTIGATORS.

27:43.160 --> 27:46.323
THEY'VE TAPED OFF
THE SOUTH SHORE OF TORCH LAKE
AS A CRIME SCENE.

27:46.360 --> 27:48.396
THEY FOUND WILDEN'S FOOTPRINTS.

27:48.430 --> 27:50.762
THEY THINK HE WAS THERE
THE NIGHT HE WAS WHACKED.

27:50.800 --> 27:53.769
AND HE WASN'T ALONE.
THE OTHER SHOEPRINTS THEY FOUND

27:53.800 --> 27:57.031
WERE A WOMAN'S. HEELS.
HIGH ONES.

27:57.070 --> 27:59.868
THE KIND ALISON
LIKED TO WEAR.

28:03.980 --> 28:07.279
Toby:
WHY ARE YOU DOING THAT?

28:07.310 --> 28:11.485
BECAUSE ACCORDING
TO PEOPLE IN THE KNOW,
IT'S TOO HONEST.

28:11.520 --> 28:14.216
WHAT THAT PERSON
DOESN'T REALIZE IS THAT
IF I DON'T OFFER THAT UP,

28:14.260 --> 28:16.911
"A's" GONNA SERVE IT UP
ON A SILVER PLATTER.

28:19.260 --> 28:22.821
WHY ARE YOU HERE, TOBY?
I DON'T WANT TO PLAY
ANY MORE OF YOUR GAMES.

28:22.860 --> 28:25.226
I MOVED THE RV.

28:25.270 --> 28:28.831
"A" ASKED FOR IT
IN EXCHANGE FOR SOMETHING
THAT I WANTED.

28:28.870 --> 28:30.906
WH-WHAT DID YOU WANT?

28:30.940 --> 28:34.000
DID YOU THINK THAT MAKING
MORE DEALS WITH THE DEVIL
WAS GONNA PROTECT US?

28:34.040 --> 28:35.905
HOW DID YOU EVEN KNOW
WHERE MONA PARKED IT?

28:35.940 --> 28:39.000
I DIDN'T. THAT WAS ALREADY
ON "A's" RADAR. ALL I DID WAS--

28:39.050 --> 28:40.472
NO, ALL YOU DID
WAS GIVE UP THE ONE THING

28:40.510 --> 28:43.980
THAT ACTUALLY COULD HAVE
HELPED US FIGURE OUT--
I KNOW.

28:48.120 --> 28:50.054
WHAT IS THAT?
A TRANSCRIPT.

28:50.090 --> 28:52.229
FROM MY MOTHER'S DOCTOR
AT RADLEY.

28:52.260 --> 28:54.148
IT WAS WRITTEN ON THE NIGHT--

28:54.200 --> 28:56.054
WHAT NIGHT?

28:56.100 --> 28:59.319
THE NIGHT SHE KILLED HERSELF.

29:34.340 --> 29:35.898
I BROUGHT
THE WRONG CAP.

29:35.940 --> 29:37.908
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING BACK HERE?

29:37.940 --> 29:39.931
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE A SPARE,
WOULD YOU?

29:39.970 --> 29:42.279
I WON'T TELL ANYBODY
YOU GAVE IT TO THE RIVAL TEAM.

29:42.310 --> 29:43.846
SORRY, I DON'T.

29:43.880 --> 29:46.144
THAT LOOKS PAINFU L.

29:46.180 --> 29:49.274
WHY DOES YOUR FRIEND HANNA
THINK I WAS BUDDIES
WITH THAT DEAD COP?

29:49.320 --> 29:52.983
I DON'T LIKE TO TALK
BEFORE THE RACE.
I HEAR YOU.

29:53.020 --> 29:56.012
I TRIED TO SAY HEY TO PAIGE,
BUT SHE'S ALREADY IN A ZONE.

29:56.060 --> 29:58.483
YOU'D THINK SHE'D CHILL
NOW THAT SHE'S GOT
THAT SCHOLARSHIP.

29:58.530 --> 30:02.250
HOW DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT?
PLEASE. NOBODY
KEEPS THAT A SECRET.

30:02.300 --> 30:06.999
I ALSO HEARD FROM OUR COACH
THAT THERE'S STILL ONE SPOT
OPEN ON STANFORD'S TEAM.

30:07.030 --> 30:09.430
I'M GUESSING YOU HAVE
YOUR EYE ON THAT PRIZE?

30:14.210 --> 30:17.031
I DO TOO.
MAY THE BEST GIRL WIN.

30:34.400 --> 30:36.891
Spencer:
"SHE'S PUT HER FOCUS
ON THE FUTURE.

30:36.930 --> 30:40.627
"MUCH OF OUR SESSION WAS DEVOTED
TO FEELINGS OF HOPE--

30:40.670 --> 30:43.935
"WANTING TO SPEND THE HOLIDAYS
WITH HER FAMILY,

30:43.970 --> 30:46.200
"MAKING UP FOR LOST TIME
WITH HER SON,

30:46.240 --> 30:49.277
THANKING HIM
FOR BEING SO PATIENT."

30:51.650 --> 30:53.345
ARE YOU SURE
THAT YOU WANT ME TO--

30:56.050 --> 31:00.510
"WHEN ASKED WHAT PROMPTED
THE TURNAROUND, MS. CAVANAUGH
WAS QUITE CLEAR:

31:00.550 --> 31:02.882
"SHE'D ALREADY MISSED OUT
ON TOO MUCH

31:02.920 --> 31:05.627
"AND WAS NO LONGER CONCERNED
WITH BEING JUDGED.

31:05.660 --> 31:09.289
"IT WAS TIME TO RETURN
SOME OF THE LOVE
THAT HAD SUSTAINED HER,

31:09.330 --> 31:11.525
ESPECIALLY FROM HER SON."

31:14.270 --> 31:18.502
DOES THAT SOUND LIKE SOMEONE
WHO STOLE A KEY LATER THAT DAY
AND JUMPED OUT A WINDOW?

31:18.540 --> 31:21.338
TOBY--
DOES IT?

31:21.380 --> 31:25.976
DOES THAT SOUND LIKE SOMEONE
WHO DIDN'T EVEN CARE ENOUGH
TO SAY GOOD-BYE?

31:26.010 --> 31:28.979
DOES IT?
TOBY, IT DOESN'T.

31:29.020 --> 31:31.113
IT DOESN'T.

31:31.150 --> 31:34.153
BUT YOUR MOM MIGHT HAVE
SAID THIS TO HER DOCTOR

31:34.190 --> 31:36.249
SO THAT HE WOULDN'T
KNOW HER PLAN--

31:36.290 --> 31:39.657
TOBY, SOME PEOPLE,
THEY FIND AN INNER PEACE
ONCE THEY DECIDE--

31:39.690 --> 31:42.420
WE NEVER SAW THIS.
HER DOCTOR NEVER SHARED THAT.

31:42.460 --> 31:44.690
THIS PLACE IS COVERING
SOMETHING UP, AND I NEED
TO KNOW MORE.

31:44.730 --> 31:48.439
YOU'RE GONNA TRUST INFORMATION
THAT "A" SUPPLIES?

31:48.470 --> 31:51.109
COME ON, WHAT DOES "A"
ULTIMATELY WANT FROM YOU?

31:51.140 --> 31:52.562
( knocking on door)

31:52.610 --> 31:55.135
PLEASE, YOU CAN'T
TELL HER ABOUT THIS.

31:55.180 --> 31:57.136
OR ANYONE ELSE.
TOBY, I--

31:57.180 --> 31:59.273
PROMISE ME.

32:03.580 --> 32:04.979
OKAY.

32:09.560 --> 32:11.983
HEY.
HEY.

32:12.030 --> 32:13.281
COME IN.

32:16.030 --> 32:18.021
( crowd cheering )

32:27.470 --> 32:29.335
WHOO!

32:38.720 --> 32:41.382
Spectator:
COME ON, EM! GO, GIRL!

33:19.190 --> 33:21.021
Man:
COME ON, EMILY!

33:21.060 --> 33:22.220
WHOO!

33:22.260 --> 33:23.352
( cheering )

33:23.400 --> 33:25.288
COME ON, EMILY!
COME ON!

33:42.620 --> 33:43.712
EMILY!

33:43.750 --> 33:45.388
EMILY!

33:55.600 --> 33:56.658
_ Man: YOU NEED STITCHES.
Emlly: MY SHOULDER DOESN'T HURT.

33:58.170 --> 33:59.569
YOU HIT YOUR HEAD.

33:59.600 --> 34:02.694
EMILY, STAY WITH US.
HOW DID YOU HURT YOUR SHOULDER?

34:02.740 --> 34:05.561
EVERYBODY BACK TO
THE POOL AREA.
PLEASE GET BACK.

34:05.610 --> 34:07.635
CAN I JUST--
NOT NOW, PAIGE. LATER.

34:07.670 --> 34:11.208
HOW DID YOU HURT
YOUR SHOULDER?

34:11.250 --> 34:13.104
FELL OFF MY BIKE.

34:13.150 --> 34:15.778
CAN I PLEASE FINISH
THE RACE? PLEASE?

34:15.820 --> 34:19.540
Aria: HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO TRUST ANYTHING THAT
SHE EVER SAYS?

34:19.590 --> 34:21.558
I MEAN, WHO KNOWS WHAT
SHE TOLD THOSE COPS?

34:21.590 --> 34:24.559
THIS IS MONA.
SHE STARTED LYING
WHEN SHE WAS A FETUS.

34:24.590 --> 34:27.286
HEY, WHY WAS TOBY SO UPSET
WHEN HE LEFT?

34:27.330 --> 34:29.389
WERE YOU GUYS FIGHTING?
NO. NO. GO BACK TO THE FETUS.

34:29.430 --> 34:31.364
DID I TELL YOU
I'M DONE WITH MARTIAL ARTS?

34:31.400 --> 34:33.868
YEAH. I CAN'T EVEN
WALK DOWN THAT STREET.
I KISSED HIM.

34:33.900 --> 34:35.367
WHO?
MY INSTRUCTOR.

34:35.400 --> 34:36.662
WHY?
I DON'T KNOW.

34:36.700 --> 34:39.134
I GUESS 'CAUSE I MISS EZRA
AND I ALMOST GOT KILLED
LAST THURSDAY

34:39.170 --> 34:40.501
AND HE SMELLS LIKE CINNAMON.

34:40.540 --> 34:42.178
WHO DOES?
JAKE.

34:42.210 --> 34:43.529
WHO'S JAKE?
MY INSTRUCTOR.

34:43.580 --> 34:45.445
PAY ATTENTION.
( door opens, closes )

34:45.480 --> 34:47.539
THANKS FOR RETURNING MY CALLS.

34:47.580 --> 34:49.172
WHERE DID YOU GET THAT?

34:49.220 --> 34:50.847
MRS. DiLAURENTIS'S PORCH.

34:50.880 --> 34:54.179
YOU STOLE HER BIRD?
SHE GAVE IT TO ME.

34:54.220 --> 34:56.381
AND IT'S NOT JUST A BIRD, OKAY?
IT TALKS.

34:58.430 --> 35:00.728
THIS BIRD PROBABLY KNOWS MORE
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO ALI
THAN ANY OF US.

35:00.760 --> 35:03.354
( squawking )]
IT TALKS A LOT.

35:03.400 --> 35:05.561
YOU THINK IT'S GONNA TELL US
IF ALI'S STILL ALIVE?

35:05.600 --> 35:07.591
WOW. I THOUGHT
THAT I WAS LOSING IT.

35:07.630 --> 35:09.393
IF YOU GUYS WOULD
SHUT UP FOR A MINUTE,

35:09.440 --> 35:10.589
MAYBE IT WOULD SAY SOMETHING.

35:17.340 --> 35:19.342
DOES IT TAKE REQUESTS?
OHH!

35:19.380 --> 35:22.713
YOU KNOW WHAT?
ALI WAS HOOKING UP WITH SOMEONE
IN CAPE MAY THAT SUMMER,

35:22.750 --> 35:24.217
AND SHE WAS TELLING HER MOM
THAT IT WAS US.

35:24.250 --> 35:25.444
YEAH. WE KNOW. WILDEN.

35:25.490 --> 35:26.741
NO, WE DON'T KNOW.

35:26.790 --> 35:28.314
IF WILDEN HAD HIS OWN BOAT,

35:28.360 --> 35:30.351
WHY WOULD HE BE STAYING
AT ALI'S PARENTS' BEACH HOUSE?

35:30.390 --> 35:31.755
THAT'S A REALLY GREAT QUESTION,

35:31.790 --> 35:33.724
BUT WE CAN'T ASK HIM
BECAUSE HE'S DEAD.

35:33.760 --> 35:36.729
AND THAT LAKE IS NOW
A CRIME SCENE. THE SHORELINE

35:36.760 --> 35:38.864
THAT WE TH REW THE CAR--
ARIA, YOU HAVE TO STOP, OKAY?

35:38.900 --> 35:41.733
THAT WAS WEEKS AGO,
AND YOU GUYS WEREN'T
WEARING PUMPS.

35:41.770 --> 35:44.159
THE FOOTPRINTS THAT
THE POLICE ARE LOOKING FOR
ARE HIGH HEELS.

35:44.210 --> 35:46.861
WAIT. WHOSE HIGH HEELS?
WELL, THE COPS DON'T KNOW,

35:46.910 --> 35:48.775
BUT MONA'S TRYING TO TELL US
THAT THEY'RE ALISON'S.

35:50.380 --> 35:52.245
WAS IT...MUDDY THAT NIGHT?

35:52.280 --> 35:55.272
Parrot:
HEY, BOARD SHORTS.
MISS ME?

35:55.320 --> 35:56.639
DID YOU JUST HEAR THAT?

35:56.680 --> 35:58.784
YEAH. I'M STANDING
RIGHT NEXT TO YOU.

35:59.890 --> 36:02.415
WAIT.

36:02.460 --> 36:04.781
LOOK, I CAME HERE
FOR A REASON.
WHAT'S WRONG?

36:04.830 --> 36:06.821
( parrot whistling )
HEY, WHAT'S THIS SONG?

36:06.860 --> 36:08.691
WHAT'S SHE SINGING?

36:08.730 --> 36:12.564
( whistling, squawking )

36:12.600 --> 36:15.660
IF "A" TRIES TO PIN
THIS WHOLE WILDEN THING
ON MY MOM--

36:15.700 --> 36:17.634
HANNA, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO WORRY.

36:17.670 --> 36:20.434
YOUR MOM WASN'T EVEN
IN ROSEWOOD THE NIGHT
THAT WILDEN WAS KILLED.

36:20.470 --> 36:23.177
( parrot whistling )

36:25.480 --> 36:26.572
( sighs )

36:34.860 --> 36:36.953
HEY. YOU HUNGRY?

36:36.990 --> 36:39.322
DO YOU WANT TO ORDER IN
OR GO OUT?

36:40.690 --> 36:42.749
MOM...

36:42.800 --> 36:45.769
WERE YOU IN NEW YORK
THE WHOLE TIME YOU WERE GONE?

36:45.800 --> 36:48.564
OF COURSE.

36:48.600 --> 36:50.465
WHERE ELSE WOULD I BE?

36:51.570 --> 36:53.231
HERE.

36:56.340 --> 36:59.548
DID YOU COME BACK
TO HAVE IT OUT WITH WILDEN?

36:59.580 --> 37:03.573
HANNA, IF YOU'RE ASKING
IF I KILLED HIM,

37:03.620 --> 37:05.713
THE ANSWER'S NO.

37:05.750 --> 37:09.356
I DID NOT KILL
DETECTIVE WILDEN.

37:17.530 --> 37:19.964
( parrot whistling,
chattering )

37:22.470 --> 37:25.598

37:35.320 --> 37:38.039

37:38.080 --> 37:42.312
( squawking, whistling )

37:44.530 --> 37:47.021
PRETTY BIRD.

37:47.060 --> 37:48.755
( dialing out, line ringing )

37:48.800 --> 37:49.994

37:50.030 --> 37:52.567

37:59.640 --> 38:04.304
( line out ringing,
parrot chattering )

38:04.350 --> 38:07.501
( whistling )

38:07.550 --> 38:09.814
Hanna: WHAT?
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

38:09.850 --> 38:12.944
HANNA, IT'S NOT A SONG
THAT TIPPI'S SINGING.

38:12.990 --> 38:14.582
IT'S A PHONE NUMBER.

38:14.620 --> 38:17.612
( whistling sequence
of touch tones )

38:23.560 --> 38:25.664
( texting )

38:37.780 --> 38:39.771
( doorbell rings )

38:44.490 --> 38:46.788
HI.

38:46.820 --> 38:49.550

38:49.590 --> 38:52.457

I SHOULD DO IN PERSON. ANWVAY,

38:52.490 --> 38:54.549
CAN I COME IN?

38:54.600 --> 38:56.397
YEAH, SURE.

38:59.600 --> 39:02.398
LOOK, I HAD A HUNCH
YOU MIGHT NOT BE COMING BACK.

39:04.810 --> 39:07.131
WHY DO YOU SAY THAT?

39:07.170 --> 39:10.139
TOOK ME BY SURPRISE.

39:10.180 --> 39:12.842
TH E--TH E KISS.

39:12.880 --> 39:16.509
I DON'T WANT YOU TO THINK
I'M NOT INTERESTED,

39:16.550 --> 39:18.916
BECAUSE...I AM.

39:18.950 --> 39:24.058
BUT IF YOU'D LIKE TO GRAB
A COFFEE OR A MEAL SOMETIME...

39:24.090 --> 39:25.978
( cell phone rings )

39:29.160 --> 39:32.527
MAYBE YOU'RE NOT
COMFORTABLE WITH THE WHOLE
TEACHER-STUDENT THING.

39:32.570 --> 39:34.128
COULD BE COMPLICATED.

39:34.170 --> 39:36.638
YEAH.

39:36.670 --> 39:38.729
( phone rings )

39:38.770 --> 39:41.477
LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY
REALLY NEEDS TO REACH YOU.

39:41.510 --> 39:44.001
WE CAN DO THIS
ANOTHER TIME.

39:45.910 --> 39:48.140
JAKE.

39:48.180 --> 39:50.910
CAN WE DO THIS
OVER THAT COFFEE?

39:58.090 --> 40:00.149
( phone ringing )

40:02.630 --> 40:04.962
IS YOUR HEAD POUNDING?
MAYBE THERE'S SOMETHING
YOU CAN TAKE.

40:05.000 --> 40:08.959
NO, I CAN'T. OKAY?
THAT'S WHY I LOST COUNT
DURING THE RACE,

40:09.000 --> 40:10.888
BECAUSE I COULDN'T
JUDGE THE DISTANCE.

40:10.940 --> 40:13.636
YOU'VE NEVER DONE THAT.

40:13.670 --> 40:16.639
I NEVER SWAM ON PAINKILLERS.

40:16.680 --> 40:18.978
HOW COME YOU DIDN'T TELL ME
HOW MUCH PAIN YOU WERE IN?

40:19.010 --> 40:22.912
BECAUSE IF I TOLD YOU
THEN I'D HAVE TO TELL YOU WHY.

40:24.220 --> 40:27.917
I MESSED UP MY SHOULDER
SAVING ARIA AND MONA.

40:27.950 --> 40:29.178
SAVING THEM FROM WHAT?

40:29.220 --> 40:32.087
NOT WHAT. WHO.

40:33.990 --> 40:37.551
IIAII?
EMILY, WHY WOULD YOU
KEEP THIS FROM ME?

40:37.600 --> 40:40.660
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO LIVE
IN THAT SPACE ANYMORE.

40:40.700 --> 40:43.498
AND I DON'T WANT YOU
TO LIVE THERE EITHER.

40:43.540 --> 40:46.532
I WANT TO LIVE IN THAT ROOM
ON YOUR COMPUTER,

40:46.570 --> 40:50.574
AND I WANT TO BE WITH YOU--
ONLY YOU-- AWAY FROM THIS TOWN.

40:50.610 --> 40:52.976
EM--
JUST YOU AND ME TOGETHER,

40:53.010 --> 40:55.911
SAFE, AND STARTING
A REAL LIFE.

40:57.250 --> 40:58.911
HEY.

40:58.950 --> 41:01.487
MAYBE WE ALREADY HAVE.

41:12.000 --> 41:14.537
( line out ringing )
Aria: IT COULD BE A BUSINESS,

41:14.570 --> 41:16.197
BUT SATURDAY NIGHT
THEY'RE CLOSED.

41:16.240 --> 41:18.128
JUST LET IT RING, OKAY?

41:18.170 --> 41:20.809
WHERE IS THIS AREA CODE,
ANYWAYS?
YORK COUNTY.

41:20.840 --> 41:23.104
DID ALI KNOW ANYBODY
FROM THERE?
I DON'T KNOW.

41:23.140 --> 41:25.040
I'M GUESSING THAT
SHE CALLED HER BEACH HOTTY

41:25.080 --> 41:26.843
"BOARD SHORTS."
OBSESSIVELY FROM GEORGIA,

41:26.880 --> 41:28.677
AMD THAT'S HOW TIPPI
LEARNED THIS NUMBER.

41:28.720 --> 41:30.244
MAYBE YOU JUST
DIALED THE NUMBER WRONG.

41:30.280 --> 41:31.178
I DIDN'T!

41:31.220 --> 41:33.848
HOW DO YOU KNOW?
YOU DIALED IT, NOT TIPPI.

41:33.890 --> 41:35.915
OKAY, LET'S JUST GO
RECORD THE BIRD.

41:35.960 --> 41:38.281
YOU GUYS, SHE'S BEEN
SINGING THIS PHONE NUMBER
ON A LOOP.

41:38.320 --> 41:40.049
I'VE HEARD IT
LIKE TWENTY TIMES.
SO HAVE I,

41:40.090 --> 41:41.728
BUT I WANT SOMEONE
TO ANSWER.

41:41.760 --> 41:43.193
SO ARIA, LET'S JUST
GO GET YOUR PHONE

41:43.230 --> 41:45.118
AND WE'LL RECORD IT TOGETHER.
OKAY.

41:55.610 --> 41:58.306
WHAT'S GOING ON?
TIPPI'S GONE.

41:58.340 --> 42:01.173
YEAH, BUT HOW?
WHO OPENED THAT CAGE?

42:03.220 --> 42:06.041
PROBABLY THE SAME PERSON
WHO OPENED THE WINDOW.

42:31.980 --> 42:33.572
( low thud )

42:47.960 --> 42:49.097
( crackle )

43:32.910 --> 43:34.207
( squawks )

43:35.910 --> 43:38.674
( whistles touch tones )

43:39.910 --> 43:40.899
( laughs )
