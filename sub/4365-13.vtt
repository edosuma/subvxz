Suits...

00:01.651 --> 00:04.636
I want to work with you.
Come to Pearson Specter.

00:04.687 --> 00:05.821
If all you want to do
is work with me,

00:05.905 --> 00:07.355
I can find a job
somewhere else.

00:07.440 --> 00:10.192
Scottie,
that's not all I want.

00:10.276 --> 00:13.078
- Then say it.
- I want you in my life.

00:13.145 --> 00:16.748
It's over, Mike.
I'm onto you.

00:16.816 --> 00:18.149
And I'm going to expose you

00:18.201 --> 00:20.502
for the lying piece of filth
that you are.

00:20.586 --> 00:22.871
Louis, I went to Harvard.
I just changed my grade.

00:22.955 --> 00:24.372
You cheated,

00:24.457 --> 00:26.157
and now you're looking at me
to help you get away with it.

00:26.209 --> 00:27.876
- No, Louis--
- Get out of my sight.

00:27.960 --> 00:29.160
Louis, he did it
so that he can practice

00:29.212 --> 00:30.378
the thing that we all love.

00:30.463 --> 00:32.330
And if you don't let it go,

00:32.381 --> 00:34.332
he's never gonna be able
to practice it again.

00:34.383 --> 00:35.600
You make Mike confess,

00:35.668 --> 00:37.052
you might as well throw his life
down the toilet.

00:37.136 --> 00:38.670
You say we're friends.

00:38.721 --> 00:40.188
A friend wouldn't ask me
to do this.

00:40.273 --> 00:41.690
No, Louis.

00:41.774 --> 00:44.676
A friend just won't hold it
against you if you don't.

00:50.566 --> 00:52.317
Hey.

00:52.368 --> 00:55.287
Where did you race off to
so quickly this morning?

00:55.354 --> 00:56.688
I went to see my mistress.

00:56.739 --> 00:58.189
Mm. Mm-hmm,
and what's her name?

00:58.241 --> 00:59.574
Felony.

00:59.659 --> 01:01.159
Really?

01:01.210 --> 01:03.295
And how would you feel
if I said the same thing to you?

01:03.362 --> 01:04.578
It depends.
Is she hot?

01:04.664 --> 01:06.030
Mmhmm, you realize

01:06.082 --> 01:07.549
you're just digging yourself in
deeper now, don't you?

01:07.633 --> 01:10.385
Well, then it's good that I
was really out getting you...

01:10.470 --> 01:12.137
This.

01:13.389 --> 01:14.589
Minnie Mouse.

01:14.674 --> 01:17.041
I got a copy from your dad.

01:17.093 --> 01:19.678
I thought
it would complement Panda.

01:19.729 --> 01:21.980
It's perfect.

01:22.047 --> 01:24.933
Good, because I have
a new lease on life.

01:25.017 --> 01:29.354
And I wouldn't
if it weren't for you.

01:29.405 --> 01:31.990
I am not the only one

01:32.057 --> 01:34.392
who helped convince Louis
to let it go.

01:34.443 --> 01:35.660
I know.

01:35.728 --> 01:37.228
So are you gonna get
something for Harvey?

01:37.280 --> 01:38.440
I want to,
but what do you get

01:38.447 --> 01:39.564
the man
who has everything?

01:39.615 --> 01:40.749
The same thing you got me.

01:40.833 --> 01:43.401
A picture of him
dressed as a mouse?

01:43.452 --> 01:45.287
No.

01:45.371 --> 01:47.739
Something money can't buy.

01:47.790 --> 01:49.291
Hmm.

01:51.377 --> 01:53.094
What do you need?

01:53.179 --> 01:54.713
- Advice.
- That tie has got to go.

01:54.764 --> 01:57.632
I've been wanting
to say something for months.

01:57.717 --> 01:59.851
It's not about the tie,
is it?

01:59.919 --> 02:01.019
You know
it's not about the tie.

02:01.086 --> 02:02.521
You're just giving me shit.

02:02.588 --> 02:04.422
We take our opportunities
where they present themselves.

02:04.473 --> 02:07.759
Now what can Donna do
for you?

02:07.810 --> 02:10.312
- I need the perfect gift.
- Mm. Who is it?

02:10.395 --> 02:12.263
Rachel?
Something personal,

02:12.315 --> 02:13.932
preferably a picture
from her father.

02:13.983 --> 02:15.600
How could you possibly--

02:15.651 --> 02:16.902
- Jessica?
Simple and elegant.

02:16.953 --> 02:19.103
Or wild and crazy,
the choice is yours.

02:19.155 --> 02:22.106
Louis?
Oh, God, doesn't matter.

02:22.158 --> 02:24.042
Just get him anything.
He'll cry for days.

02:24.109 --> 02:25.410
What about Harvey?

02:25.461 --> 02:28.446
There is no gift for Harvey.

02:28.497 --> 02:29.714
He gets what he wants,

02:29.782 --> 02:31.216
and he doesn't want
what he doesn't get.

02:31.283 --> 02:33.251
And my knowing that is the only
gift he'll ever need from me.

02:33.302 --> 02:35.670
Donna, ever since
I've been here,

02:35.755 --> 02:37.675
every morning, I step
off that elevator wondering

02:37.723 --> 02:39.257
if this is going to be
my last day.

02:39.308 --> 02:42.310
Last week, that day came,
and Harvey said, "not today."

02:42.395 --> 02:44.095
I...

02:44.146 --> 02:45.564
I just--I need
to get him something

02:45.631 --> 02:48.567
to let him know
what that means to me.

02:50.019 --> 02:51.937
- Okay.
- What?

02:51.988 --> 02:54.973
There is one thing that Harvey
has been wanting to get

02:55.024 --> 02:57.525
for years,
and he hasn't been able to.

02:57.610 --> 03:00.645
- What is it?
- No, it's too personal.

03:00.696 --> 03:01.780
And I don't see
how you're going to be able

03:01.831 --> 03:03.192
to make it happen
when he couldn't.

03:03.249 --> 03:06.201
Whatever it is,
it'll make the perfect gift.

03:06.285 --> 03:07.669
Before we do anything else,

03:07.753 --> 03:10.655
I'd like to officially welcome
our newest senior partner,

03:10.706 --> 03:12.007
Dana Scott.

03:12.091 --> 03:13.851
I'd like to thank you all
for bringing me in.

03:13.876 --> 03:17.178
And I assure you, I will be
hitting the ground running.

03:17.263 --> 03:18.797
Well, that's what
we like to hear.

03:18.848 --> 03:20.715
Harvey, where do we stand
on Franklin Courier?

03:20.800 --> 03:23.635
They just announced plans
for the acquisition Friday.

03:23.686 --> 03:25.520
I'd like to take lead
on this one.

03:25.605 --> 03:28.473
I guess the ground
has been hit.

03:28.524 --> 03:30.308
It's yours.

03:30.359 --> 03:31.977
Shit.
I am so sorry.

03:32.028 --> 03:33.311
I had an incident at Logan.

03:33.362 --> 03:35.313
Did I miss anything?
Not really.

03:35.364 --> 03:37.565
Scottie's going to be handling
the Franklin acquisition.

03:37.566 --> 03:38.950
You're kidding, right?

03:39.018 --> 03:40.819
Franklin's my client.
I was five minutes late.

03:40.870 --> 03:42.320
Ten minutes, actually.

03:42.371 --> 03:44.155
Well, I don't care
if I skipped

03:44.206 --> 03:46.658
the whole goddamn meeting
to get a full-body wax.

03:46.709 --> 03:49.210
I landed that company when
they were a regional shithole,

03:49.295 --> 03:51.029
and I don't need
some interloper to--

03:51.080 --> 03:52.998
Scottie's a senior partner,
Louis.

03:53.049 --> 03:55.050
Oh, this is bullshit.

03:55.134 --> 03:57.002
Then I guess you're saying
the bylaws are bullshit.

03:57.053 --> 04:00.171
My bylaws are a work of art.

04:00.222 --> 04:01.923
I know.

04:02.008 --> 04:03.425
And the bylaws clearly state
that if a senior partner

04:03.509 --> 04:04.893
is more than ten minutes late
to a meeting,

04:04.977 --> 04:06.728
he or she has no standing.

04:06.812 --> 04:08.396
Well, that rule doesn't take
into consideration

04:08.481 --> 04:11.549
a partner being late due
to reasons beyond his control.

04:11.600 --> 04:12.984
Wait.
I'm sorry.

04:13.052 --> 04:15.520
"This rule shall not be abridged
by any circumstance,

04:15.571 --> 04:17.387
"including but not limited
to family illness,

04:17.440 --> 04:18.920
"criminal detention,
and travel delay.

04:18.940 --> 04:23.561
For without punctuality,
we are animals," right?

04:23.612 --> 04:26.331
How dare you quote me to me?
This isn't over.

04:26.398 --> 04:27.866
Yes, it is.

04:27.917 --> 04:29.451
They're still
your client, Louis,

04:29.535 --> 04:31.569
but it's Scottie's transaction.

04:31.620 --> 04:32.954
Moving on.

04:35.875 --> 04:36.791
Boom.

04:36.876 --> 04:38.376
What's this?

04:38.427 --> 04:40.929
Oh, it's only the greatest
gift you've ever received.

04:41.013 --> 04:43.765
Better than M.J.'s jersey
from the 63-point game?

04:43.849 --> 04:45.383
If this folder had played
in that game,

04:45.434 --> 04:46.634
it would have scored
80 points.

04:46.719 --> 04:47.886
Okay, I don't even know
what that means.

04:47.937 --> 04:49.771
Neither do I.
Just open it.

04:49.855 --> 04:51.773
A run-of-the-mill
corporate case.

04:51.857 --> 04:53.257
I don't get it.

04:53.309 --> 04:56.311
Just look at the attorney
of record on the other side.

04:56.395 --> 04:58.613
A. Eliot Stemple.

04:58.698 --> 04:59.814
How did you know?

04:59.899 --> 05:01.265
I talked to Donna.
She told me everything.

05:01.317 --> 05:03.485
- Define "everything."
- Oh, I don't know.

05:03.569 --> 05:05.870
He kicked your ass in moot court
three years running at Harvard.

05:05.938 --> 05:07.622
You're kind of upset about it.
It keeps you up at night.

05:07.707 --> 05:09.607
Yeah, well,
if she told you everything,

05:09.658 --> 05:12.160
you'd know he's been ducking me
for the past ten years.

05:12.244 --> 05:13.378
Harvey, I just told you

05:13.445 --> 05:15.163
this gift is
better than M.J.'s jersey.

05:15.247 --> 05:16.581
Do you think
I'd make that kind of claim

05:16.632 --> 05:17.713
if I couldn't deliver
on it?

05:17.750 --> 05:18.717
What are you saying?

05:18.784 --> 05:20.051
I'm saying

05:20.119 --> 05:23.304
that A. Eliot Stemple
is not ducking you today.

06:07.356 --> 06:08.840
Louis, if this is
about Franklin Courier,

06:08.898 --> 06:10.198
I've made my decision.

06:10.265 --> 06:11.733
- It's not.
- Okay.

06:11.784 --> 06:13.101
Then what's this about?

06:13.152 --> 06:14.569
- It's about Franklin Courier.
- Louis.

06:14.620 --> 06:15.987
Jessica, I want to know where
I fall in the pecking order

06:16.072 --> 06:18.156
with regard to Dana Scott.
There is no pecking order.

06:18.240 --> 06:20.158
I don't look at things that way.
Great.

06:20.242 --> 06:22.403
That means I'm behind her
because she's banging Harvey.

06:22.411 --> 06:24.045
I'm going to pretend
I didn't just hear that.

06:24.113 --> 06:25.463
Well, unfortunately,

06:25.548 --> 06:26.965
I can't pretend that
you didn't just screw me over

06:27.049 --> 06:29.117
on behalf
of your partner's girlfriend.

06:29.168 --> 06:31.503
Louis,
I didn't screw you over.

06:31.587 --> 06:33.671
Your own bylaws did.

06:33.756 --> 06:35.090
And if the shoe
were on the other foot

06:35.141 --> 06:36.558
and you'd taken
the case from her,

06:36.625 --> 06:38.176
you'd be sleeping
like a baby.

06:38.260 --> 06:39.761
What does that have to do
with anything?

06:39.812 --> 06:41.096
All right, you know what, don't
bother answering that question.

06:41.147 --> 06:44.349
As far as I'm concerned,
Dana Scott is dead to me.

06:44.433 --> 06:46.801
Louis...

06:46.852 --> 06:49.637
Did it ever occur to you
that these situations

06:49.688 --> 06:52.907
may sometimes be a result
of your own doing?

06:52.975 --> 06:54.475
What on God's green earth
are you talking about?

06:54.527 --> 06:56.978
You have an opportunity
to bond

06:57.029 --> 06:58.446
with our newest
senior partner

06:58.497 --> 07:00.331
or make a permanent enemy
of her.

07:00.416 --> 07:02.283
And I'm saying, in the past,

07:02.334 --> 07:04.119
you've generally chosen
the enemy route.

07:04.170 --> 07:06.121
Can you give me
a specific?

07:06.172 --> 07:08.322
- Off the top of my head?
- Mm-hmm.

07:08.374 --> 07:12.994
Pemberton, Yates, Cohen,
Duffner, Ramirez...

07:14.346 --> 07:16.181
That's
five isolated incidents.

07:16.265 --> 07:18.683
Robinson, Jenkins, Gardner.

07:18.767 --> 07:20.468
Okay, okay, fine.
What's your point?

07:20.519 --> 07:23.605
My point is,
if you let this thing go,

07:23.672 --> 07:25.557
you can change
the entire course

07:25.641 --> 07:28.443
of your relationship
with Scottie...

07:28.510 --> 07:30.228
And who knows,

07:30.312 --> 07:33.314
maybe even redefine yourself
within the firm.

07:36.902 --> 07:38.653
Words to live by.

07:38.704 --> 07:40.538
Jessica,
you may have just changed

07:40.623 --> 07:43.491
my entire outlook on life.

08:08.484 --> 08:10.902
Is that a bomb?
It's a gift.

08:10.936 --> 08:13.188
You're giving me a gift after
what happened this morning?

08:13.239 --> 08:14.355
You're right.

08:14.406 --> 08:17.742
You did poach my client
on a technicality.

08:17.826 --> 08:19.227
And worse than that,

08:19.278 --> 08:22.864
you used my own precious words
against me, and normally,

08:22.915 --> 08:24.782
I'd declare war, but--
But what?

08:24.867 --> 08:27.418
It's been pointed out to me
that I have certain proclivities

08:27.503 --> 08:28.753
that need to be adjusted.

08:28.837 --> 08:30.255
Louis,
what are you saying?

08:30.339 --> 08:33.207
I'm saying I would like us
to be friends.

08:40.249 --> 08:41.883
It's very sweet.

08:41.933 --> 08:45.253
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

08:45.304 --> 08:48.473
- So we're friends?
- Friends.

08:48.557 --> 08:50.391
Great.
Give me my files back.

08:50.442 --> 08:51.776
Excuse me?

08:51.860 --> 08:54.112
You accepted my friendship.
Give me back my case.

08:54.196 --> 08:56.931
Uh, sorry, Louis.
That's not how it works.

08:56.982 --> 08:58.650
What the hell
kind of friend are you?

08:58.734 --> 09:01.269
I'm a friend who is not going
to give you my case

09:01.320 --> 09:02.954
14 seconds
after you give me a scarf.

09:03.038 --> 09:04.822
No, no, no,
it's not a scarf.

09:04.907 --> 09:06.374
It's one
of the world's finest pashminas.

09:06.441 --> 09:08.209
I don't care if it's
the world's only pashmina.

09:08.277 --> 09:11.045
You're not getting this case.

09:11.113 --> 09:12.280
Well, then you leave me
no choice

09:12.331 --> 09:14.499
but to institute
article 19.5/b.

09:14.583 --> 09:16.634
There is no article 19.5/b.

09:16.719 --> 09:18.286
There is now.

09:18.337 --> 09:21.139
All new hires must be
accompanied to client meetings

09:21.223 --> 09:23.007
by the existing attorney
of record.

09:23.092 --> 09:24.458
You son of a bitch.

09:24.510 --> 09:26.294
You just want to start a fight.
Excuse me?

09:26.345 --> 09:27.845
I tried to make friends
with you,

09:27.930 --> 09:29.491
and you just told me
to go screw myself.

09:29.565 --> 09:32.567
I am warning you, Louis.

09:32.634 --> 09:35.770
This is a fight
you do not want.

09:35.821 --> 09:38.940
Oh, no, I want it,
and I'm gonna win it.

09:38.991 --> 09:42.860
And when I do, you better not
go crying to your boyfriend.

09:53.539 --> 09:57.091
Well, look who it is,
the ghost of Christmas past,

09:57.159 --> 09:58.760
Harvey Reginald Specter.

09:58.827 --> 10:01.162
Speaking of the past,
A. Eliot, F.D.R. called.

10:01.213 --> 10:03.497
He wants his bowtie back.

10:03.549 --> 10:05.099
Oh, if you'd had rebuttals
like that,

10:05.167 --> 10:07.852
maybe you would've gotten
past me in moot court just once.

10:07.936 --> 10:10.104
Trust me, Archibald,
I'm way past you.

10:10.172 --> 10:13.007
Oh, I guess you are.
Look at you, huh?

10:13.058 --> 10:14.859
Tom Ford suit,
$1,000 hairdo.

10:14.943 --> 10:16.527
What happened
to the skirt-chasing degenerate

10:16.612 --> 10:18.196
I knew back at Harvard?
Oh, him?

10:18.280 --> 10:21.349
He's a name partner at a firm
ten times bigger than yours.

10:21.400 --> 10:23.785
Bigger? Sounds like
somebody's trying to compensate

10:23.852 --> 10:26.537
for three huge losses.

10:26.622 --> 10:28.022
Or somebody's living
in the past and too afraid

10:28.073 --> 10:29.194
to take me on
in the present.

10:29.241 --> 10:30.524
You're the one
who's afraid.

10:30.576 --> 10:32.526
I think you've got
a little PTSD--

10:32.578 --> 10:33.961
post-traumatic
Stemple disorder.

10:34.029 --> 10:35.863
Why don't we go head-to-head
right now?

10:35.914 --> 10:37.198
Oh, I'd love to.

10:37.249 --> 10:38.750
But unfortunately,
my case is up on the docket.

10:38.834 --> 10:40.474
But let's do this again
really soon, okay?

10:40.502 --> 10:41.552
Call me.

10:45.307 --> 10:49.344
AYZ Technologies
versus Janus Microprocessors.

10:49.395 --> 10:51.062
Mike Ross for the plaintiff,
your honor.

10:51.146 --> 10:53.931
A. Eliot Stemple
for the defense.

10:54.016 --> 10:55.716
What are you doing here?
Oh, I'm sorry.

10:55.768 --> 10:58.102
Did I forget to put the name
of my firm on the complaint?

10:58.187 --> 11:00.104
I work at Pearson Specter.

11:00.189 --> 11:04.242
That's Specter,
as in Harvey Reginald Specter.

11:04.326 --> 11:06.327
I'm ready
to hear pretrial motions.

11:06.395 --> 11:08.663
Motion to substitute counsel,
your honor.

11:08.730 --> 11:09.730
On what grounds?

11:09.782 --> 11:11.949
On the grounds
that he's a pussy.

11:12.034 --> 11:14.902
- What's that, Mr. Specter?
- I was just wondering

11:14.953 --> 11:17.588
if he has a copy of his motion,
because we never got one.

11:17.673 --> 11:20.458
Not with me, your honor.
Something suddenly came up.

11:20.542 --> 11:23.044
My niece, she took ill.

11:23.095 --> 11:26.347
Well, when your family's sick,
you have to tend to them.

11:26.415 --> 11:28.766
Your honor, Mr. Stemple may
not have a copy of his motion,

11:28.851 --> 11:31.436
but we do have a copy
of his family tree.

11:31.520 --> 11:34.021
He has no nieces.

11:34.089 --> 11:36.107
I meant "niece"
figuratively.

11:36.191 --> 11:37.942
She is actually
my goddaughter.

11:38.026 --> 11:39.610
And what exactly
is her name?

11:39.695 --> 11:41.529
Sandra Silverstein.

11:41.596 --> 11:43.764
Your honor, that's
the same fictitious goddaughter

11:43.816 --> 11:45.066
that's taken ill

11:45.117 --> 11:47.235
every time Mr. Stemple's
needed a continuance

11:47.286 --> 11:48.736
in the last five years.

11:48.787 --> 11:50.071
Sounds serious.

11:50.122 --> 11:51.873
Have you tried acupuncture?

11:51.940 --> 11:54.075
They are completely
out of line, Your Honor.

11:54.126 --> 11:57.211
The only thing out of line
is you.

11:57.279 --> 11:59.964
Mr. Stemple, not only will you
not be replacing yourself,

12:00.048 --> 12:02.550
you'll be paying the court
a $2,000 fine.

12:05.287 --> 12:07.255
We got him.
The cage match is on.

12:07.306 --> 12:09.640
Two men enter,
one man leaves.

12:09.725 --> 12:11.008
We don't have anything yet.

12:11.093 --> 12:12.427
What?

12:12.478 --> 12:14.312
Come on, you need me to try
this thing for you too?

12:14.396 --> 12:16.848
Listen to me.
This isn't thunderdome.

12:16.932 --> 12:19.434
I need you to look at every case
he's worked since law school.

12:19.485 --> 12:20.902
Relax, Harvey.
I'm all over it.

12:20.969 --> 12:23.154
You better be,
because you don't know this guy.

12:23.238 --> 12:25.106
I'm telling you,
once it sinks in

12:25.157 --> 12:26.741
that there's no way
out of that cage,

12:26.808 --> 12:30.144
he's gonna
come out swinging.

12:36.412 --> 12:39.275
You wasted a trip.
Harvey's gone for the night.

12:39.276 --> 12:41.380
I'm not here to see Harvey.
I'm here to see you.

12:41.381 --> 12:43.249
Please, what I have to say
is important.

12:43.300 --> 12:44.783
I'm not interested
in what you have to say.

12:44.835 --> 12:48.304
In law school,
I had nothing.

12:48.388 --> 12:49.472
Nothing.

12:49.556 --> 12:51.891
No friends, no girlfriend,
no respect.

12:51.958 --> 12:56.178
The truth is, I was hanging on
to not flunking out by a tread.

12:57.898 --> 13:00.015
Look at me.
I'm not married.

13:00.100 --> 13:02.935
I don't have children.
I'm not particularly successful.

13:02.986 --> 13:06.138
Why are you
telling me this?

13:06.189 --> 13:08.741
I have a little piece of glory
that I've been holding on to,

13:08.808 --> 13:11.643
and I don't expect Harvey
to care about that.

13:11.695 --> 13:13.079
But you're still first chair.

13:13.146 --> 13:16.365
You can still let me out.

13:16.450 --> 13:20.119
And I thought
that maybe you would.

13:20.170 --> 13:22.821
I'll think about it.

13:22.873 --> 13:24.457
That's all I can ask for.

13:24.508 --> 13:27.960
Except for one thing.

13:28.011 --> 13:30.679
That's the exact same speech
that your plaintiff gave Harvey,

13:30.764 --> 13:31.797
year one.

13:31.848 --> 13:34.133
Doesn't mean it isn't true.

13:34.184 --> 13:35.584
You think
I'm gonna let you play me?

13:35.602 --> 13:37.269
A man can try.

13:37.337 --> 13:39.021
Stemple, you've been ducking
Harvey long enough.

13:39.106 --> 13:41.640
Now you're either gonna win,
or you're gonna lose.

13:41.691 --> 13:44.810
What you're not gonna do
is avoid him anymore.

13:44.861 --> 13:47.480
Oh, and you forgot.

13:47.531 --> 13:48.781
I looked up your family tree.

13:48.848 --> 13:50.649
You are married,
you do have children,

13:50.700 --> 13:52.485
and your firm is top tier.

13:52.536 --> 13:54.870
Please, I hate my wife,
my children are anchors,

13:54.955 --> 13:56.655
and the only reason
I stay at that firm

13:56.706 --> 13:58.624
is to pay for them
to leave me alone.

14:02.195 --> 14:03.829
Get the hell on the elevator,
Stemple.

14:03.880 --> 14:05.714
I'm not leaving you
in our office.

14:05.799 --> 14:07.366
Good call.

14:17.477 --> 14:18.811
Eliot Stemple,
that's a blast from the past.

14:18.878 --> 14:20.346
You should have seen
his smug face

14:20.397 --> 14:21.880
when he realized
he couldn't duck me.

14:21.932 --> 14:23.048
Need my help?

14:23.099 --> 14:25.234
No, I am taking this one
all for myself.

14:25.318 --> 14:27.770
Harvey,
it was three times.

14:27.854 --> 14:29.094
You remember
what it did to you?

14:29.156 --> 14:30.523
Yeah, I remember.

14:30.574 --> 14:32.241
But instead of offering help
where it isn't needed,

14:32.325 --> 14:33.909
you should be focused
on Louis Litt.

14:33.994 --> 14:35.861
After what you did
at that meeting,

14:35.912 --> 14:37.580
he's going to come at you
full-bore.

14:37.664 --> 14:40.916
I wouldn't have it
any other way.

14:41.001 --> 14:44.036
You picked a fight
with him on purpose.

14:44.087 --> 14:45.737
- Of course I did.
- What happened to the whole

14:45.789 --> 14:47.840
"we need to be open
and honest" thing?

14:47.907 --> 14:49.575
I didn't think we needed
to be open and honest

14:49.626 --> 14:50.926
that one plus one
equals two.

14:51.011 --> 14:52.545
I get it.

14:52.596 --> 14:54.046
You don't want to be seen
as my girlfriend,

14:54.097 --> 14:55.297
so you picked a fight
with the biggest,

14:55.382 --> 14:56.715
baddest prisoner
in the yard.

14:56.766 --> 14:59.101
I win this, I'm the partner
that beat Louis Litt,

14:59.186 --> 15:01.270
not the partner sleeping
with Harvey Specter.

15:01.354 --> 15:03.222
Okay, I respect that.

15:03.273 --> 15:05.191
But Louis just did me
a huge favor,

15:05.258 --> 15:06.592
and I don't want to get caught
in the middle of it.

15:06.643 --> 15:09.061
I don't need you
in the middle of it.

15:09.112 --> 15:10.062
Good.

15:10.113 --> 15:12.031
Although...

15:12.098 --> 15:13.432
What did you do?

15:13.483 --> 15:14.650
Well, it's not really
what I did.

15:14.734 --> 15:18.871
- It's, um...
- What you did.

15:18.938 --> 15:20.789
What did I do?

15:20.874 --> 15:23.158
Louis,
what are you doing here?

15:23.243 --> 15:24.276
Hey, I got your email
last night.

15:24.327 --> 15:26.328
- Yeah, about that--
- No, no, no.

15:26.413 --> 15:28.280
I was happy to get it,
happy to do the work.

15:28.331 --> 15:29.615
Nothing makes me happier

15:29.666 --> 15:30.799
than to spend all night
helping out a friend.

15:30.884 --> 15:32.284
You were up all night?

15:32.335 --> 15:34.169
Caught a power nap
between 4:30 and 4:45.

15:34.254 --> 15:35.921
I'll be fine.

15:35.972 --> 15:37.389
Well,
what'd you come up with?

15:37.457 --> 15:38.724
Per your instructions,

15:38.791 --> 15:39.975
I went through eight years

15:40.060 --> 15:41.727
of Pritchard Holdings
corporate returns

15:41.794 --> 15:43.596
with a fine-tooth comb.

15:43.647 --> 15:45.481
That's a remarkably long
time frame.

15:45.565 --> 15:47.399
Yeah, you ask for four,
I give you eight.

15:47.467 --> 15:48.651
It's what I do.

15:48.735 --> 15:50.936
And I caught every mistake
there was to find.

15:50.987 --> 15:52.321
Great.
File the amended returns.

15:52.405 --> 15:53.606
With any luck,

15:53.657 --> 15:57.693
Jenner Pharmaceuticals
will be none the wiser.

15:57.777 --> 15:59.245
Jenner Pharmaceuticals?

15:59.312 --> 16:00.746
This suit's
against Miller Trucking.

16:00.813 --> 16:04.166
That's what I meant,
Miller Trucking.

16:04.251 --> 16:06.285
Ah.

16:06.336 --> 16:07.986
What are they
suing them for?

16:08.038 --> 16:09.154
Trucking?

16:09.205 --> 16:11.323
God damn it.

16:11.374 --> 16:12.824
You sent that email
just to screw with me.

16:12.876 --> 16:14.960
Louis,
I didn't send the email.

16:15.011 --> 16:16.178
Scottie did.

16:16.263 --> 16:17.713
She used my computer.
I didn't even know.

16:17.797 --> 16:19.515
Oh, bullshit.
She came running to you.

16:19.599 --> 16:20.766
You played on our friendship.

16:20.833 --> 16:22.101
And just now
you had me go on about it

16:22.168 --> 16:23.168
to continue the mockery.

16:23.219 --> 16:24.436
Look, I wasn't mocking you.

16:24.504 --> 16:26.505
I was trying to keep you
from finding out.

16:26.556 --> 16:28.607
I thought if you didn't know,
no harm would be done.

16:28.675 --> 16:30.976
No, you know what,
harm was done.

16:31.027 --> 16:33.028
And if you value
this friendship at all,

16:33.113 --> 16:34.480
you would stay out of it,

16:34.531 --> 16:36.148
because I'm going
to the mattresses

16:36.199 --> 16:37.283
against Dana Scott.

16:37.350 --> 16:38.651
Mattresses?

16:38.702 --> 16:40.486
Have you been watching
<i>The Godfather?</i>

16:40.537 --> 16:42.020
Yeah, I've been trying to
come up with some common ground

16:42.072 --> 16:44.156
to expand our friendship--
sue me.

16:48.295 --> 16:49.361
Tell me you finished
the proposal

16:49.412 --> 16:50.713
for Franklin Courier.

16:50.797 --> 16:51.797
No.

16:51.864 --> 16:53.198
What do you mean, no?

16:53.249 --> 16:55.033
I mean I didn't do it.

16:55.085 --> 16:56.418
What, did your mother die?

16:56.503 --> 16:57.783
Because if she didn't,
you know--

16:57.804 --> 16:59.421
Louis,
you told me not to.

16:59.506 --> 17:00.973
We're at war, Bennett.
Why would I do that?

17:01.040 --> 17:02.560
I don't know,
but I got a note from you

17:02.592 --> 17:03.892
telling me that you were gonna
be the bigger person

17:03.977 --> 17:05.144
and let Dana Scott handle it.

17:05.211 --> 17:06.377
The bigger person?

17:06.429 --> 17:07.546
You should've known
that was not from me.

17:08.682 --> 17:10.148
Good morning, Louis.
Great day.

17:10.215 --> 17:11.883
Oh, you look a little tired.

17:11.935 --> 17:13.234
I'm not tired.
I don't get tired.

17:13.353 --> 17:15.404
What do you want, Dana?
I'm just dropping this by.

17:15.488 --> 17:16.989
You sent Franklin
a proposal?

17:17.056 --> 17:18.272
Well, I couldn't meet them
without you,

17:18.358 --> 17:20.559
so I figured that I would
send this over instead.

17:20.609 --> 17:22.394
You did this
behind our backs.

17:22.444 --> 17:25.164
I don't believe in doing
things behind people's backs.

17:25.231 --> 17:27.082
That's why I c.c.'d you both
on this letter.

17:27.166 --> 17:29.168
No, you c.c.'d us, so they'd
know that it came from you,

17:29.235 --> 17:30.515
and we had nothing to do
with it.

17:30.570 --> 17:31.670
It did come from me,

17:31.738 --> 17:33.172
and you did have nothing
to do with it.

17:33.239 --> 17:34.673
Yeah, you want to play it
this way, fine.

17:34.741 --> 17:36.291
But if you think
you can outsmart me,

17:36.376 --> 17:37.876
you're gonna get Litt up.
Litt the hell up.

17:37.927 --> 17:39.878
Litt up?

17:39.929 --> 17:42.097
Litt. Oh.

17:42.182 --> 17:44.767
Oh, my God, that is so cute.

17:44.851 --> 17:46.418
I'm gonna go make fun of it
on my Facebook page right now.

17:46.469 --> 17:47.919
Thank you.

17:51.424 --> 17:54.476
Okay, we're gonna take
this thing apart limb by limb

17:54.561 --> 17:55.811
so that little Miss Bullshit

17:55.895 --> 17:57.696
wished she'd never heard
the name Louis Litt.

17:57.764 --> 17:59.531
Louis,
she's an excellent attorney.

17:59.599 --> 18:00.949
What if we can't find
anything wrong with it?

18:01.034 --> 18:02.434
We're not gonna find
anything wrong with it.

18:02.485 --> 18:03.819
That's why we're gonna
take it apart,

18:03.903 --> 18:04.953
to make something wrong
with it.

18:05.038 --> 18:07.406
Mr. Walker,
in October of last year,

18:07.457 --> 18:09.124
you made a pitch to the chairman
of Kyoto Computers.

18:09.209 --> 18:10.442
How did that pitch go?

18:10.493 --> 18:11.443
It went amazingly,

18:11.494 --> 18:13.162
right up
until when they told us

18:13.246 --> 18:14.963
there was no way they could
actually buy our product.

18:15.048 --> 18:16.415
And why was that?

18:16.466 --> 18:18.617
Because Janus threatened
to withhold their microchip

18:18.668 --> 18:21.470
if Kyoto did even $1 worth
of business with us.

18:21.554 --> 18:23.922
And my next-door neighbor says
he saw his next-door neighbor

18:23.973 --> 18:25.290
cheating on his wife.

18:25.341 --> 18:27.059
Turned out to be nothing
but a vindictive lie.

18:27.126 --> 18:29.928
These are sworn affidavits
from the CEOs of Kyoto, Griffon,

18:29.979 --> 18:33.632
and Howland all backing up
Mr. Walker's claim.

18:33.683 --> 18:37.853
This isn't your next-door
neighbor, Archibald.

18:37.937 --> 18:40.305
Mr. Walker, the truth is
that we control the market

18:40.356 --> 18:42.775
because our product is
better than yours, isn't it?

18:42.826 --> 18:44.476
No, it isn't.

18:44.527 --> 18:46.328
Jake, come on.
The cameras are on.

18:46.413 --> 18:48.580
We're all under oath here.
We are?

18:48.648 --> 18:49.998
He is.

18:50.083 --> 18:52.451
And I have
independent analysis

18:52.502 --> 18:54.486
and sworn testimony
from other CEOs

18:54.537 --> 18:56.488
disputing everything
your client just said.

18:56.539 --> 18:59.007
Those things aren't worth
the paper they're printed on.

18:59.092 --> 19:00.826
My point is
that you can go to court,

19:00.877 --> 19:03.495
spend years fighting
a battle you may not win,

19:03.546 --> 19:06.849
or you can take
this settlement.

19:11.337 --> 19:13.305
This is actually
pretty fair.

19:13.356 --> 19:15.023
More than fair.

19:15.108 --> 19:17.008
The only thing is, he's trying
to get us to sign it,

19:17.060 --> 19:18.610
so he can use it against us
in court.

19:18.678 --> 19:20.446
Just like he did last year
against Micron

19:20.513 --> 19:22.448
and the year before that
against Suntech.

19:22.515 --> 19:24.650
You're just a one-trick pony,
Archibald.

19:24.701 --> 19:27.352
And once you've been
to the show, it's not that good.

19:27.403 --> 19:30.456
Hmm, you're a one-trick pony
too, Reginald.

19:30.523 --> 19:33.191
Only my trick doesn't end
with my own client suing me.

19:33.243 --> 19:36.128
- This deposition's over.
- What do you mean, it's over?

19:36.195 --> 19:37.475
Don't you want
Mr. Walker to know

19:37.530 --> 19:39.164
that you were just sued
for malpractice?

19:39.215 --> 19:40.499
That client
dropped that suit.

19:40.550 --> 19:42.468
And before she did,
she stated on the record

19:42.535 --> 19:44.920
that she got shafted because
you had a personal vendetta

19:45.004 --> 19:46.538
against your opposing counsel.

19:46.589 --> 19:48.724
He likes to pick fights
with other lawyers,

19:48.808 --> 19:50.425
and he doesn't give a shit
what it does to his clients.

19:50.510 --> 19:52.878
- Okay, that's a lie.
- It is?

19:52.929 --> 19:55.213
I think you and I both know
why he took this case,

19:55.265 --> 19:57.483
because he lost this case
and this case

19:57.550 --> 19:59.434
and this case to me
15 years ago.

19:59.519 --> 20:00.986
Go ahead, ask him.

20:01.053 --> 20:02.821
He's not under oath,
but you'll know if he's lying.

20:02.889 --> 20:04.323
And these cases,
they were all in moot court.

20:04.390 --> 20:06.942
Imagine what he'll bring down
on you when the stakes are real.

20:07.026 --> 20:08.410
I can tell you this much,

20:08.495 --> 20:09.828
it'll be a hell
of a lot more expensive

20:09.896 --> 20:10.996
than that settlement.

20:11.063 --> 20:13.916
Stemple, we're done.

20:14.000 --> 20:17.669
Reginald,
you did a great job

20:17.737 --> 20:19.288
making it so I couldn't
get out of it,

20:19.372 --> 20:22.674
but you should have picked
a better case to trap me in.

20:24.243 --> 20:27.212
Because we both know
that my independent analyst

20:27.263 --> 20:31.767
will come up with anything
that I want him to say.

20:34.270 --> 20:35.721
Did you hear
what he just said?

20:35.772 --> 20:36.889
I sure did.

20:36.940 --> 20:38.440
And if you did, and I did...

20:38.525 --> 20:41.026
Maybe it did.

20:52.462 --> 20:54.463
♪
I already had breakfast, Michael.

20:54.514 --> 20:57.849
Maybe, but that's a bag
completely filled with bacon.

20:57.934 --> 20:58.850
Crispy?

20:58.935 --> 21:00.185
To quote my friend Benjamin,

21:00.269 --> 21:02.804
"if it's not crispy,
it's not bacon."

21:02.855 --> 21:04.890
I don't deserve it.

21:04.974 --> 21:06.057
Benjamin.

21:06.142 --> 21:07.842
Michael, I can enhance
the sound of a bee

21:07.894 --> 21:09.861
making pollen recorded
from a satellite.

21:09.946 --> 21:11.146
How can you possibly
know that?

21:11.197 --> 21:12.314
It's been done.

21:12.365 --> 21:13.648
But what I can't do
is enhance sounds

21:13.699 --> 21:15.283
that weren't picked up
by a used camcorder,

21:15.351 --> 21:17.402
because this firm is too cheap
to go with my recommendation

21:17.487 --> 21:19.854
of the $63,000 ZR-X90.

21:19.906 --> 21:21.546
You didn't really
recommend that, did you?

21:21.574 --> 21:23.125
It's also good for making
independent films on weekends.

21:23.192 --> 21:24.409
Okay, Benjamin,

21:24.494 --> 21:26.962
I need this audio,
or we're screwed on a huge case.

21:27.029 --> 21:29.297
Michael,
look at these sound waves.

21:29.365 --> 21:31.917
Okay.

21:32.001 --> 21:33.635
There's nothing there.
No, nothing.

21:33.702 --> 21:35.470
And that's after 12 hours of
maximum enhancement on the tape

21:35.538 --> 21:36.871
and six Red Bulls in me.

21:36.923 --> 21:39.841
Whoa, you shouldn't be having
that many Red Bulls.

21:39.892 --> 21:41.143
I did it for you, Michael.

21:41.210 --> 21:42.544
What do we have?

21:42.595 --> 21:44.179
Uh, nothing.

21:44.230 --> 21:47.182
Then we go
with what we got.

21:48.551 --> 21:50.152
What's he talking about?

21:50.219 --> 21:52.904
He's saying Stemple bluffed,
so now we're gonna bluff.

21:52.989 --> 21:55.407
What exactly are we
talking about here, gentlemen?

21:55.491 --> 21:59.394
We want access to the raw data
from his independent analysis.

21:59.445 --> 22:01.530
And I wish I would've had
a vasectomy ten years ago.

22:01.581 --> 22:04.232
But raw data is work product,
and he has no right to it.

22:04.283 --> 22:05.450
The work product doctrine

22:05.535 --> 22:06.918
is fairly clear on this,
Mr. Specter.

22:06.920 --> 22:09.421
Except in cases of misconduct,
Your Honor,

22:09.505 --> 22:11.339
is fairly clear on this,
which is the situation here.

22:11.407 --> 22:14.009
What exactly
are you accusing me of?

22:14.076 --> 22:16.628
At the end of our deposition,
Mr. Stemple basically boasted

22:16.712 --> 22:19.347
that he plans to fix
the findings of his analyst.

22:19.415 --> 22:20.515
That is a lie.

22:20.583 --> 22:21.516
I never said anything
of the kind.

22:21.584 --> 22:22.801
What you mean to say is

22:22.885 --> 22:24.603
you didn't think our microphone
would pick it up.

22:24.687 --> 22:26.188
So let me get this straight.

22:26.255 --> 22:28.273
They're doctoring a tape to
accuse me of doctoring a report.

22:28.357 --> 22:30.609
Mr. Stemple, you have
a history of lying to me.

22:30.693 --> 22:31.977
So if you're on that tape

22:32.061 --> 22:33.902
saying anything close
to what they're claiming,

22:33.929 --> 22:37.816
I'll not only sanction you,
I'll report you to the bar.

22:37.900 --> 22:40.285
I'll give them what they want.

22:40.369 --> 22:42.871
I have to admit,
when I read 600 million Euros,

22:42.938 --> 22:45.457
I thought it was a typo.
It wasn't.

22:45.541 --> 22:47.275
Baltic Freight can get
a bottle of Riesling

22:47.326 --> 22:49.411
from an Alsatian Vineyard
to a Dubai hotel in six hours.

22:49.462 --> 22:51.913
This is a steal.
I agree. The proposal-

22:51.964 --> 22:53.965
most riveting thing I've read
since <i>Fifty Shades of Grey.</i>

22:54.050 --> 22:55.217
But--

22:55.284 --> 22:56.585
But the real upside for you
is that I...

22:56.636 --> 22:57.969
- We.
- Not exactly.

22:58.054 --> 22:59.621
Structured the deal
to avoid U.S. taxes.

22:59.672 --> 23:02.257
By setting up a subsidiary
with headquarters in Cyprus.

23:02.308 --> 23:03.675
Where the rate
is only 5.7%.

23:03.759 --> 23:05.093
Wait a second,

23:05.144 --> 23:07.462
doesn't that mean they would
have to build in Cyprus?

23:07.513 --> 23:09.764
Mmhmm, and I've already
locked up a developer.

23:09.815 --> 23:11.483
Yeah, I see that,
the Whitner Group.

23:11.567 --> 23:13.235
Whoa, I'm so sorry.
Did you just say Whitner Group?

23:13.302 --> 23:14.236
Right now
they're being investigated

23:14.303 --> 23:15.487
by the FTC for fraud.

23:15.571 --> 23:16.905
What?

23:16.972 --> 23:19.574
Yeah, it was just announced
this morning.

23:19.642 --> 23:20.609
Well,
those are bogus charges

23:20.660 --> 23:22.444
concocted
by a jealous competitor

23:22.495 --> 23:24.829
who will stop at nothing--
I'm so sorry, Tom.

23:24.914 --> 23:27.649
As Dana mentioned,
I was c.c.'d on this,

23:27.700 --> 23:29.317
but I didn't exactly
have a chance to vet it.

23:29.368 --> 23:30.835
Tom.

23:30.920 --> 23:31.920
Our reputation is everything,
Ms. Scott.

23:31.987 --> 23:33.421
We can't be in bed
with criminals.

23:33.489 --> 23:35.323
I will have another proposal
over to you within the hour.

23:35.374 --> 23:36.508
Thank you, Louis.

23:36.592 --> 23:38.927
Oh, and, Tom,
Scottie's new, okay?

23:38.994 --> 23:40.295
So just cut her some slack.

23:40.346 --> 23:41.630
Because when
those training wheels pop off,

23:41.681 --> 23:44.349
she's gonna be
really, really good.

23:48.020 --> 23:50.055
- What the hell did you do?
- Nothing.

23:50.139 --> 23:51.673
I just called a friend
at the FTC.

23:51.724 --> 23:53.007
You made up charges
against a company

23:53.059 --> 23:54.175
just to get back at me?

23:54.226 --> 23:55.610
I did nothing of the kind.

23:55.678 --> 23:57.758
I simply alerted a friend
to some possible misdoings.

23:57.813 --> 24:00.198
These are people.
You are hurting their business.

24:00.283 --> 24:01.533
Oh, please,
give me a break.

24:01.617 --> 24:02.951
They're not publicly traded.

24:03.018 --> 24:04.018
They don't have a stock price
that'll fall.

24:04.070 --> 24:05.019
And if they're as clean
as you say,

24:05.071 --> 24:06.354
I'm sure they'll be exonerated.

24:06.405 --> 24:09.157
But not in time for me
to get Franklin's business.

24:09.208 --> 24:10.692
Oh, I don't give a shit
when they're exonerated.

24:10.743 --> 24:13.194
You're never getting
Franklin's business.

24:13.245 --> 24:15.463
You really are a dick.

24:23.172 --> 24:26.808
I'm Moby goddamn dick,
and you just swam in my waters.

24:33.382 --> 24:36.067
Per your request,
this is everything.

24:36.152 --> 24:39.070
You didn't just come over here
to deliver work product.

24:39.155 --> 24:40.572
I've got
a revised settlement offer.

24:40.656 --> 24:42.774
And before you say anything,
it contains a provision

24:42.858 --> 24:44.326
prohibiting me
from using it against you.

24:44.393 --> 24:47.061
After what happened today,
you think I'm going to settle?

24:47.113 --> 24:48.633
Please, Harvey,
just take a look at it.

24:48.698 --> 24:49.698
So now that
you need something,

24:49.749 --> 24:51.566
it's Harvey, not Reginald.

24:51.617 --> 24:52.834
Settling is what you do.

24:52.901 --> 24:55.737
Not with you.

24:55.788 --> 24:57.339
And the reason I'm not gonna
settle with you--

24:57.406 --> 24:58.506
I get it.

24:58.574 --> 25:00.175
I ducked you.

25:00.242 --> 25:03.261
Look, I could take the losing,
the gloating, and the taunting.

25:03.346 --> 25:05.630
But what I can't take
is losing to a coward

25:05.715 --> 25:09.884
who's too afraid to stand up
and try to beat me again.

25:09.935 --> 25:11.519
I didn't beat you
the first time.

25:11.587 --> 25:15.223
What the hell
are you talking about?

25:15.274 --> 25:16.858
It was rigged.

25:16.925 --> 25:20.228
I bribed the jury.

25:20.279 --> 25:22.564
- What?
- That's why I keep ducking you.

25:22.615 --> 25:25.116
You're telling me
you cheated all three years?

25:25.201 --> 25:27.952
Once I won,

25:28.037 --> 25:31.272
I was the guy
who beat Harvey Specter.

25:31.323 --> 25:33.441
There was no going back.

25:33.492 --> 25:36.611
And you think admitting that
now is gonna make me settle?

25:36.662 --> 25:39.214
I'm coming clean because
it's time to put it to bed.

25:39.281 --> 25:40.948
Put it to bed?

25:41.000 --> 25:43.951
You gonna take an ad out in
the Crimson saying you cheated,

25:44.003 --> 25:45.804
just like you did
when you beat me back then?

25:45.888 --> 25:47.972
- Harvey.
- No, no, I remember it.

25:48.057 --> 25:50.842
Muhammad Ali standing
over Sonny Liston.

25:50.926 --> 25:53.011
Your face on Ali,
mine on Liston,

25:53.095 --> 25:54.345
every day for a week.

25:54.430 --> 25:56.464
You know who my hero was,
Eliot?

25:56.515 --> 25:57.632
Ali.

25:57.683 --> 26:00.468
That's right,
you piece of shit.

26:02.571 --> 26:05.190
You want to know
why I did that?

26:05.274 --> 26:07.442
Because you were
an arrogant bastard

26:07.493 --> 26:09.644
who skated through life
without a care in the world,

26:09.695 --> 26:12.580
getting everything you wanted
from anyone you needed!

26:13.999 --> 26:15.950
And you know what,

26:16.001 --> 26:18.369
if I had to do it again,

26:18.454 --> 26:21.322
I would do
the exact same thing.

26:21.373 --> 26:23.174
I'm not settling.

26:23.259 --> 26:27.328
You so much as think about
breaking the law on this case,

26:27.379 --> 26:30.998
I guarantee
you'll end up in jail.

26:43.950 --> 26:45.067
Is this--
Yes.

26:45.108 --> 26:46.942
- With extra--
- Yes.

26:46.993 --> 26:49.528
- To what do I owe this honor?
- Dana Scott.

26:49.613 --> 26:51.163
- No.
- Hear me out.

26:51.248 --> 26:52.698
You won.

26:52.783 --> 26:54.083
I'm not saying you have
to give in to her.

26:54.150 --> 26:56.502
I'm saying,
make amends with her.

26:56.586 --> 26:59.004
Mm, and why would I want
to do that?

26:59.089 --> 27:00.005
Well, it would help
if you tried

27:00.090 --> 27:01.490
putting yourself
in her shoes.

27:01.541 --> 27:03.125
The same shoes that tried
walking away with my client?

27:03.176 --> 27:04.794
Louis, all I'm saying is,

27:04.845 --> 27:06.512
she came here
from Darby International

27:06.596 --> 27:07.996
to be Harvey's girlfriend.

27:08.048 --> 27:09.432
I'd say that's enough baggage

27:09.499 --> 27:11.033
to deserve you
cutting her some slack.

27:11.101 --> 27:12.501
But I did cut her
some slack, Donna.

27:12.552 --> 27:13.936
I bought her
the world's finest pashmina,

27:14.003 --> 27:15.187
and she wiped her ass
with it in return.

27:15.272 --> 27:16.605
Okay, I got it.

27:16.673 --> 27:18.390
You're never gonna like her.
Forget I said anything.

27:18.475 --> 27:20.309
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
wait a second.

27:20.360 --> 27:23.011
Did Harvey send you here?
No, Louis, he didn't.

27:23.063 --> 27:24.346
Harvey doesn't care
about this.

27:24.397 --> 27:26.198
Why do you?

27:27.701 --> 27:30.703
Because I know Harvey,
I know Scottie, and I know you.

27:30.787 --> 27:32.988
And if somebody
doesn't back down,

27:33.039 --> 27:34.623
this isn't gonna end well.

27:34.691 --> 27:36.792
Are you saying
that you or Harvey

27:36.860 --> 27:38.127
are gonna hold this
against me?

27:38.194 --> 27:40.079
No, Louis,
I'm not saying that.

27:40.163 --> 27:42.030
Good, because then
I'll tell you what I told him.

27:42.082 --> 27:43.916
If our friendship
is dependent on this,

27:44.000 --> 27:45.968
then we do not have
a friendship at all.

27:46.035 --> 27:47.970
It's not.

27:49.639 --> 27:52.207
I was just trying to help.

27:56.045 --> 27:57.379
Mr. Morris,

27:57.430 --> 28:00.149
please tell the court
what the raw data indicates

28:00.216 --> 28:02.401
about the two companies'
microprocessors.

28:02.486 --> 28:04.386
And I remind you,
you're under oath.

28:04.437 --> 28:08.190
Both products operate
at the exact same rate.

28:08.241 --> 28:10.025
What you're saying is,

28:10.076 --> 28:12.661
our product is just
as good as theirs.

28:12.729 --> 28:14.897
I'm saying their performance
is identical.

28:14.948 --> 28:16.398
And yet Janus dominates
the marketplace.

28:16.449 --> 28:17.533
Why is that?

28:17.584 --> 28:19.568
Objection.
Calls for speculation.

28:19.619 --> 28:20.953
Oh, I'll tell you why.

28:21.037 --> 28:22.738
It has nothing to do
with product superiority

28:22.789 --> 28:24.907
and everything to do with Janus
bullying its competitors.

28:24.958 --> 28:26.408
That's not a question,

28:26.459 --> 28:28.744
nor is it Mr. Morris' area
of expertise.

28:28.795 --> 28:30.179
No, it isn't.

28:30.246 --> 28:32.631
Bullying is his client's area
of expertise.

28:32.716 --> 28:34.350
No further questions.

28:34.417 --> 28:37.937
Mr. Morris,
you just testified

28:38.021 --> 28:41.590
that the microprocessors'
performance was identical.

28:41.641 --> 28:44.109
Is it possible that they are
actually identical?

28:44.194 --> 28:46.645
- Anything's possible.
- How would that be?

28:46.730 --> 28:48.697
Either it's
a one-in-a-billion event,

28:48.765 --> 28:51.033
or one of them stole
the other one's design.

28:51.100 --> 28:52.568
Mm.

28:52.619 --> 28:54.870
Your honor, based on evidence
introduced by opposing counsel

28:54.938 --> 28:56.288
and Mr. Morris' testimony,

28:56.373 --> 28:57.990
I would like to file
a countersuit

28:58.074 --> 29:00.576
against AYZ
for patent infringement.

29:00.627 --> 29:01.794
That is outrageous.

29:01.878 --> 29:04.663
His client stole
my client's design.

29:04.748 --> 29:06.131
I am the one
who is outraged.

29:06.216 --> 29:08.634
This case has nothing to do
with patent infringement.

29:08.718 --> 29:11.136
It does now, Reginald.

29:12.889 --> 29:16.058
Move!
We need to talk.

29:16.125 --> 29:17.793
Not now, I'm carbo-loading.

29:17.844 --> 29:18.894
For what?

29:18.962 --> 29:21.480
For you!
We're still at war.

29:21.565 --> 29:22.648
No, we're not.

29:22.732 --> 29:24.066
So what,

29:24.133 --> 29:25.467
you're telling me
you're waving the white flag?

29:25.518 --> 29:30.606
No, I am waving this,
bylaw 19.5/b,

29:30.657 --> 29:32.975
in clear violation of 139/j.

29:33.026 --> 29:34.810
I got ratification per 139j.

29:34.861 --> 29:38.197
There wasn't
a quorum present.

29:38.281 --> 29:39.531
Big deal,
technical violation.

29:39.616 --> 29:41.667
Not for you.
You're on the bylaw committee.

29:41.751 --> 29:44.503
And you know what the bylaws say
about a member of the committee

29:44.588 --> 29:48.257
implementing an amendment
without approval?

29:48.324 --> 29:49.341
Immediate removal.

29:49.426 --> 29:50.676
So back the hell
off my case.

29:50.760 --> 29:52.094
This won't stand.

29:52.161 --> 29:56.015
Louis, I am warning you
to not keep pursuing this.

29:56.099 --> 29:58.100
I've beaten you before,
and I will beat you again.

29:58.167 --> 30:00.436
- You've never beaten me before.
- Haven't I?

30:00.503 --> 30:03.522
Who do you think it was
that assigned Nigel

30:03.607 --> 30:06.525
to go against you
in the dissolution talks?

30:06.610 --> 30:07.943
Meow.

30:08.011 --> 30:10.178
- You're the devil.
- No.

30:10.230 --> 30:13.849
I'm not the devil.
I'm a strategic thinker.

30:13.900 --> 30:15.985
Louis Litt,
you are hereby notified

30:16.036 --> 30:17.556
that your services
are no longer needed

30:17.621 --> 30:18.871
on Franklin Courier.

30:18.955 --> 30:22.041
And if you go around me,
I will invoke 139j on your ass.

30:23.376 --> 30:25.711
- He set us up.
- You think I don't know that?

30:25.795 --> 30:27.162
He made our client
look like a thief.

30:27.213 --> 30:28.414
It's not true.

30:28.498 --> 30:29.698
It doesn't matter
if it's not true.

30:29.749 --> 30:31.700
Now we're on the defensive.

30:31.751 --> 30:34.336
Gentlemen,
that settlement offer

30:34.387 --> 30:36.005
is about to get flipped
on its ass.

30:36.056 --> 30:38.257
And thank you for introducing
that evidence,

30:38.341 --> 30:40.175
'cause it wouldn't have been
as credible coming from me.

30:40.226 --> 30:41.677
You dropped that comment
on purpose.

30:41.728 --> 30:43.545
Mmhmm. I knew that camcorder
wouldn't pick it up,

30:43.596 --> 30:45.648
just like I knew you would bluff
to get that data.

30:45.715 --> 30:48.383
You made us work for it,
or we would've seen it coming.

30:49.519 --> 30:51.219
He would never have seen
anything coming

30:51.271 --> 30:54.890
once I fed him that bullshit
about bribing the jury.

30:54.941 --> 30:56.892
I've got your number,
Reginald.

30:56.943 --> 30:59.828
I haven't been ducking you.
I've just been setting you up.

30:59.896 --> 31:02.781
I took a page
from your hero's playbook,

31:02.866 --> 31:06.001
rope-a-dope.

31:10.740 --> 31:12.240
I heard about today.

31:12.292 --> 31:13.759
If you hadn't,

31:13.843 --> 31:16.124
I'm sure there'll be an ad
about it in the paper tomorrow.

31:16.179 --> 31:18.297
What?

31:18.381 --> 31:22.267
Stemple says he's got
my number, and it's true.

31:22.352 --> 31:24.419
I don't know what to do.

31:24.471 --> 31:25.971
What are our options?

31:26.056 --> 31:28.376
For all I know, this deal's
the best I'm ever going to get.

31:28.424 --> 31:31.143
Stemple's been outthinking me
ever since I met him.

31:31.227 --> 31:34.279
You're the only other person
who's ever done that.

31:34.364 --> 31:35.781
I need your help.

31:35.865 --> 31:39.284
Have I ever told you about
my high school tennis career?

31:39.369 --> 31:40.736
I didn't even know
you played.

31:40.787 --> 31:43.822
I was 38 and 3.

31:43.907 --> 31:46.375
You know who handed me
every one of those losses?

31:46.442 --> 31:47.376
Eliot Stemple?

31:47.443 --> 31:49.294
Marsha Myers.

31:50.830 --> 31:55.450
A 5-foot-nothing math geek
with a 20-mile-an-hour serve.

31:55.502 --> 31:57.953
I should have left
a Marsha Myers skid mark

31:58.004 --> 31:59.972
on the court
and never looked back.

32:00.056 --> 32:03.759
But instead, the little bitch
was a human backboard.

32:03.810 --> 32:05.310
And I think about it
to this day.

32:05.395 --> 32:06.478
You're saying
I should take the deal

32:06.563 --> 32:07.646
because I can't beat him?

32:07.731 --> 32:09.398
I'm saying
I know what it's like

32:09.465 --> 32:11.433
to have an Eliot Stemple.

32:11.484 --> 32:13.235
So I'm going to ask you
a question,

32:13.302 --> 32:15.637
and I want you to give me
an instant response.

32:15.688 --> 32:17.973
Do you want to beat him,
or do you want to settle?

32:18.024 --> 32:19.858
I want to leave
an Eliot Stemple skid mark.

32:19.943 --> 32:21.309
Then there's your answer.

32:21.361 --> 32:22.978
If he's got your number,

32:23.029 --> 32:26.999
then what you want to do
is what he wants you to do.

32:27.083 --> 32:30.169
Harvey, I've been looking
at Stemple's cases.

32:30.253 --> 32:32.087
Doesn't matter.

32:32.155 --> 32:33.516
What do you mean
it doesn't matter?

32:33.540 --> 32:34.990
We're taking the settlement.

32:35.041 --> 32:37.926
- You're just gonna give up?
- Jessica has a plan.

32:37.994 --> 32:39.378
Fighting is stepping
into a trap.

32:39.462 --> 32:40.796
We'd be giving him
exactly what he wants.

32:40.847 --> 32:42.765
Jessica was wrong.

32:42.832 --> 32:44.349
Is that a fact?

32:44.434 --> 32:45.884
You looked at it
the right way.

32:45.969 --> 32:47.519
You just came
to the wrong conclusion.

32:47.604 --> 32:50.189
Stemple wants us to fight,
but I know why.

32:50.273 --> 32:51.473
He was on this case

32:51.524 --> 32:52.558
long before you and I
came into the picture.

32:52.642 --> 32:55.360
What he wants--
what he really wants--

32:55.445 --> 32:57.980
has nothing to do
with you.

33:09.555 --> 33:11.039
Don't you look ready
to rumble?

33:11.090 --> 33:12.373
We're not.

33:12.425 --> 33:14.426
We want to take your deal,
with one small change.

33:14.510 --> 33:17.345
- I'm not lowering the amount.
- No, don't worry.

33:17.396 --> 33:18.597
Instead of $10 million,

33:18.681 --> 33:20.432
we'd like to give you
100 million.

33:20.516 --> 33:21.650
Because that would
still cost us less

33:21.717 --> 33:24.269
than if we fought you
and you got this.

33:26.439 --> 33:28.740
- I have no idea what that is.
- Yes, you do.

33:28.824 --> 33:30.408
It's the glue
that enables AYZ

33:30.493 --> 33:31.910
to stack more microchips
than you,

33:31.994 --> 33:32.911
and you've been after it
for a year.

33:32.995 --> 33:34.896
And when you saw me coming,

33:34.947 --> 33:37.449
you used the opportunity
to bait me

33:37.533 --> 33:39.084
into introducing evidence

33:39.168 --> 33:41.903
so that you could turn it around
and manufacture a suit

33:41.954 --> 33:44.623
to get your hands on that
during discovery.

33:48.410 --> 33:49.844
You can't prove that.

33:49.912 --> 33:52.580
I can when I ask
your analyst

33:52.632 --> 33:54.849
why you hired him
in the first place.

33:54.917 --> 33:56.301
He's gonna say
that Janus needed the technology

33:56.385 --> 33:57.752
and was willing to do anything
to get it.

33:57.803 --> 34:00.254
You don't know
that he'll roll over on me.

34:00.306 --> 34:01.773
Ali versus Liston.

34:01.857 --> 34:03.391
I'm gonna make him
roll over on you.

34:03.442 --> 34:05.093
So here's
what's gonna happen.

34:05.144 --> 34:06.928
You're gonna drop the suit,

34:06.979 --> 34:09.931
publicly admit to wrongdoing,
and pay us this.

34:13.768 --> 34:15.654
This'll cost my client
a fortune.

34:15.737 --> 34:16.771
Yeah, but it's better
than being convicted

34:16.822 --> 34:18.106
of corporate espionage.

34:18.157 --> 34:20.792
Eliot, I'm giving you
a dignified way out,

34:20.876 --> 34:24.295
a chance to really
put it to bed.

34:24.380 --> 34:27.966
Now the judge is gonna bang
that gavel in 30 seconds.

34:28.050 --> 34:30.969
And when that happens,
it's gonna be too late.

34:40.563 --> 34:43.264
We'll take the deal.

34:45.985 --> 34:47.068
I'm just saying,
if you're gonna quote a movie,

34:47.136 --> 34:48.603
quote a movie.

34:48.654 --> 34:49.904
I got one word wrong.

34:49.972 --> 34:51.806
It changed the entire meaning
of the quote.

34:51.857 --> 34:53.306
Not to me, it didn't.

34:53.359 --> 34:54.442
That's what I thought
the quote was.

34:54.493 --> 34:55.777
Okay, fine.

34:55.828 --> 34:57.862
You want to be disrespectful
to Martin Scorsese,

34:57.947 --> 34:59.313
you go right ahead.

34:59.365 --> 35:01.366
Martin Scorsese didn't even
write the damn movie.

35:01.450 --> 35:03.251
If anything, it's disrespectful
to the writer.

35:03.285 --> 35:05.319
Harvey, who cares
about the writer?

35:05.371 --> 35:06.838
I guess
you're right about that.

35:06.922 --> 35:08.957
- Where have you two been?
- I took him to dinner.

35:09.008 --> 35:10.658
Oh, that's never
happened before.

35:10.710 --> 35:12.827
Well, he's never beaten
A. Eliot Stemple before.

35:12.878 --> 35:14.679
No, he hasn't.

35:14.764 --> 35:17.465
What could be different
about this time?

35:17.516 --> 35:18.800
I didn't work for him then.

35:18.851 --> 35:20.135
Yeah, but didn't
he duck Harvey

35:20.186 --> 35:21.469
the whole time
you did work for him?

35:21.520 --> 35:22.937
Okay, fine.

35:23.005 --> 35:24.856
You were responsible
for beating Stemple,

35:24.940 --> 35:27.192
but I was the one who told you
about Harvey's shameful losses

35:27.276 --> 35:28.810
in the first place.
What does he always say?

35:28.861 --> 35:32.013
0 and everything, Donna.
0 and everything.

35:32.064 --> 35:34.983
- Are you finished?
- Yes, thank you.

35:35.034 --> 35:36.618
Oh, and Jessica wanted
to see you

35:36.685 --> 35:38.370
as soon as you got back.
She say what it's about?

35:38.454 --> 35:41.122
No, but I was talking
to Mike.

35:43.659 --> 35:45.860
Hmm.

35:47.863 --> 35:49.030
I heard you won.

35:49.081 --> 35:51.299
- Oh, we didn't just win.
- I know.

35:51.366 --> 35:54.869
You got a Fortune 500 company
to publicly admit wrongdoing.

35:54.920 --> 35:56.204
Doesn't happen every day.

35:56.255 --> 35:57.806
So why don't you
look happy?

35:57.873 --> 36:01.643
I am happy about the win.

36:01.710 --> 36:05.513
But I got a call from the editor
of <i>New York Lawyer,</i>

36:05.564 --> 36:06.931
and they want to interview
the man responsible

36:07.016 --> 36:08.516
for making that happen.

36:08.567 --> 36:11.052
And you want to give Harvey
the credit.

36:11.103 --> 36:12.187
I want you
to take your name off.

36:12.238 --> 36:13.488
I already did.

36:13.555 --> 36:15.490
This case was never for me.
It was for Harvey.

36:15.557 --> 36:17.275
I took my name off
as first chair

36:17.359 --> 36:18.743
the second
we trapped Stemple.

36:18.828 --> 36:20.695
I appreciate that.

36:20.746 --> 36:25.417
But because of this interview,
you can't be any chair.

36:29.755 --> 36:31.506
So you don't want me
off this case

36:31.573 --> 36:33.007
so that Harvey
can get the credit.

36:33.075 --> 36:34.292
You want me off this case,

36:34.376 --> 36:35.927
so I don't get
anywhere near the spotlight.

36:36.011 --> 36:37.378
In your position,

36:37.430 --> 36:40.048
the spotlight can become
an interrogation lamp

36:40.099 --> 36:41.800
pretty damn fast.

36:41.884 --> 36:44.919
I understand.

36:44.970 --> 36:47.856
No spotlight.

36:56.265 --> 36:58.900
This is always
how it's gonna be, isn't it?

37:02.271 --> 37:04.456
I thought you knew that.

37:08.277 --> 37:11.112
I guess I did.

37:14.467 --> 37:15.834
Hey, can I talk to you?

37:15.918 --> 37:17.469
Sure, Louis.
What can I do for you?

37:17.553 --> 37:21.973
Um, I'm sure you heard about
Dana Scott's throttling of me.

37:22.057 --> 37:23.308
I haven't.

37:23.392 --> 37:25.643
You both wanted me
to stay out of it, and I did.

37:25.728 --> 37:28.730
Right.

37:28.797 --> 37:30.565
See, after Scottie took my case,
I went to Jessica.

37:30.632 --> 37:34.969
I was after blood, and...
She told me--

37:36.438 --> 37:40.108
She told me that I bring
these things on myself,

37:40.159 --> 37:42.610
and she was right.

37:42.661 --> 37:45.113
And that got me to wondering,
what would've happened

37:45.164 --> 37:48.750
if I hadn't shown up
to that meeting late?

37:48.817 --> 37:51.485
So I went to the library,

37:51.537 --> 37:53.838
and I found a copy
of the bylaws.

37:53.923 --> 37:56.674
Scottie underlined
six different traps.

37:56.759 --> 37:59.093
She deliberately picked a fight
to embarrass me,

37:59.161 --> 38:00.661
and I want to know
if you knew.

38:00.713 --> 38:03.097
She didn't do it
to embarrass you.

38:03.165 --> 38:06.634
She wanted to beat the meanest,
toughest guy at the firm.

38:06.685 --> 38:09.387
- Okay.
- It's a sign of respect.

38:11.506 --> 38:13.841
See,
the problem with that is,

38:13.893 --> 38:17.946
when that guy loses...
He's done.

38:18.013 --> 38:21.783
He is no longer the meanest,
baddest guy in the firm.

38:21.850 --> 38:23.351
He's nothing.

38:23.402 --> 38:25.119
Louis...

38:26.822 --> 38:28.740
What do you want from me?

38:28.824 --> 38:30.241
I need you
to use your power

38:30.326 --> 38:31.647
to give me this case
over Scottie.

38:31.660 --> 38:32.827
I can't do that.

38:32.878 --> 38:34.078
Harvey, she can survive this.
I can't.

38:34.163 --> 38:35.484
- Louis--
- Listen, you came to me

38:35.497 --> 38:37.215
and said I was your friend
when you needed a favor.

38:37.299 --> 38:38.750
Well, I am now coming to you,

38:38.834 --> 38:40.534
saying that I need a favor
in return.

38:40.586 --> 38:41.753
The last time we talked,

38:41.837 --> 38:43.537
you said if I value
our friendship at all,

38:43.589 --> 38:44.872
I'd stay out of it.

38:44.924 --> 38:48.309
I don't care.

38:48.377 --> 38:50.228
I know how you operate.

38:50.312 --> 38:51.813
I let it go with Mike
for you.

38:51.880 --> 38:53.160
And what I'm asking for
in return

38:53.215 --> 38:57.902
doesn't even come close,
so...

38:57.987 --> 39:02.357
I do operate that way, Louis,
but not with my friends.

39:02.408 --> 39:05.893
So I'm only gonna
ask you this once.

39:05.945 --> 39:08.913
Are you asking as a friend,
or are you calling in a chit?

39:15.621 --> 39:17.755
I'm calling in a chit.

39:20.793 --> 39:22.961
So be it.

39:24.763 --> 39:26.848
- Are you mad?
- I'm disappointed.

39:26.915 --> 39:28.016
Harvey, I--

39:28.083 --> 39:31.102
You can't have it
both ways, Louis.

39:52.074 --> 39:54.042
Hi.

39:54.109 --> 39:56.160
The furniture came.

39:56.245 --> 39:59.631
Look, I know we said that
we'd go with all my choices,

39:59.715 --> 40:03.451
but it turns out you have got
pretty good taste.

40:03.502 --> 40:07.121
Yes.
Yes, I do.

40:07.172 --> 40:08.789
- So?
- Hmm?

40:08.841 --> 40:10.124
What do you think?

40:10.175 --> 40:13.461
I think
that I can't believe

40:13.512 --> 40:15.480
you did all of this
in one day.

40:15.564 --> 40:17.565
Well, I've been working on it
since I got home.

40:17.632 --> 40:19.734
I just wanted to have
all of it ready,

40:19.801 --> 40:21.185
so we could celebrate
your big win.

40:21.270 --> 40:24.405
Was Harvey appreciative?

40:24.473 --> 40:26.353
Yeah, are you kidding?
He took me out to dinner.

40:26.358 --> 40:28.976
Oh! Dinner.

40:29.028 --> 40:32.664
Next thing you know,
you'll be getting a promotion.

40:32.748 --> 40:35.366
Yeah. Next thing.

40:44.043 --> 40:46.177
- Hey.
- Hey, yourself.

40:46.261 --> 40:48.096
I hope you don't mind
that I let myself in.

40:48.163 --> 40:50.965
You ready to celebrate?

40:51.016 --> 40:54.552
- I'm ready for a drink.
- Well, hurry up.

40:54.636 --> 40:56.003
Because underneath
these clothes,

40:56.055 --> 40:57.388
I am entirely naked.

40:57.473 --> 40:58.806
Scottie.

41:00.726 --> 41:02.443
What's wrong?

41:02.511 --> 41:03.611
You were in such
a good mood earlier.

41:03.678 --> 41:04.845
What happened?

41:04.897 --> 41:08.316
- I was.
- But?

41:12.488 --> 41:15.856
Scottie, I need you to give
Louis his transaction back.

41:17.159 --> 41:18.459
What?

41:18.527 --> 41:19.994
He figured out that
you set the whole thing up,

41:20.045 --> 41:22.330
and he came to me.
So what?

41:22.381 --> 41:24.082
What does that have to do
with anything?

41:24.166 --> 41:27.201
You can survive this.
He can't.

41:27.252 --> 41:28.573
Wait, so let me get
this straight.

41:28.587 --> 41:31.089
Louis tells me
that if I lose

41:31.173 --> 41:33.091
I can't go running
to my boyfriend,

41:33.175 --> 41:35.059
and then he turned around
and does the exact same thing?

41:35.144 --> 41:36.894
Scottie,
I need you to do this.

41:36.979 --> 41:39.063
Does this have something to do
with that favor he did you?

41:39.148 --> 41:40.881
Yes.

41:45.354 --> 41:48.406
Okay.
Tell me what it is.

41:48.490 --> 41:50.408
I can't.

41:52.828 --> 41:53.745
Guess we're not
sharing everything

41:53.829 --> 41:54.895
with each other
after all.

41:54.947 --> 41:56.197
Scottie.

41:56.248 --> 41:57.782
Harvey, before you say
what you're about to say,

41:57.866 --> 42:00.568
I need to know.

42:00.619 --> 42:03.504
Am I talking
to my boyfriend,

42:03.572 --> 42:06.591
or am I talking
to a name partner?

42:06.675 --> 42:08.242
That depends
on your answer.

42:08.293 --> 42:11.078
You can't have it
both ways, Harvey.

42:14.800 --> 42:17.418
Then you're talking
to a name partner.
