busted it clear off the hinge.

04:26.467 --> 04:31.300

-(laughs)
Sure, um, I heard some dude
kickin' down here,

04:39.200 --> 04:42.200
looked out my window,
I live upstairs.
I saw--

04:42.233 --> 04:45.500
I thought he was just drunk.
So I came down, uh, didn't
see anyone.

04:45.533 --> 04:48.233
Went back upstairs.
Some dude-- Then I heard him
kickin again,

04:48.267 --> 04:50.967
I heard, boom boom boom,
could feel the floor up there.

04:51.067 --> 04:52.533
And I came down,
and he was in here, like,

04:52.567 --> 04:55.700
I don't know...
I think he must've been
workin' on the alarm,

04:55.733 --> 04:58.600
or somethin' like, you know,
break-- tryin' to break it
off the wall, it was beepin'.

04:58.633 --> 05:00.800
He didn't look like
he was in a great state
of mind, I was like,

05:00.833 --> 05:02.800
-Mm-hm.
-(bleep) that, went upstairs
and called you guys.

05:02.833 --> 05:05.800
-He was tryin' to disable
the alarm?
-Or kick the door, I'm not sure.

05:05.833 --> 05:08.633
Honestly, I kinda saw him
and was like, "F" that,
and kinda moved on. (laughs)

05:08.667 --> 05:11.300
-Okay.
All right, thank you...
-Yeah. No problem, man.

from them, right?
Have a seat, please.

05:22.067 --> 05:24.700
-Yeah, I asked him his name.
If he had mental health issues.

05:24.733 --> 05:26.967
And that's all
I've asked him for.

05:27.067 --> 05:29.300
-And what's his name?
-South Carolina?

in my...

05:45.800 --> 05:47.467
-What happened here?

05:47.500 --> 05:49.700
-I just went to get
some cigarettes and lunch.

05:49.733 --> 05:52.267
-Okay.
And the alarm started
goin' off?

05:52.300 --> 05:54.233
Did you kick the door open?
-Yes, sir, I did.

05:54.267 --> 05:57.100

do once you disengaged

06:09.433 --> 06:11.067

-Just grab cigarettes, sir.

06:11.067 --> 06:12.600
-You were just gonna
get cigarettes and go?

06:12.633 --> 06:14.733
-Yes, sir.

06:16.100 --> 06:19.067
Are you doin' okay?
-Just wanted a cigarette.

06:19.067 --> 06:21.233

06:21.267 --> 06:23.833

06:23.867 --> 06:27.067

any help from the VA at all?

06:27.067 --> 06:30.067
You said you're a veteran?
-No, I was in the process
of doin' that.

06:30.067 --> 06:32.633

06:32.667 --> 06:35.800

06:44.400 --> 06:45.733
(car door closes)

06:47.833 --> 06:50.100
-On patrol, I-- I like to look
for narcotics.

06:50.133 --> 06:52.133
I think that narcotics
lead to warrants,

06:52.167 --> 06:54.567
lead to the drug money,
leads to guns.

06:54.600 --> 06:57.400
Um, most of the people
that are out committin' crimes

06:57.433 --> 07:00.400
are committin' crimes
to purchase drugs,

07:00.433 --> 07:04.667
whether-- they're probably
an addict, and, uh,
commit crimes

07:04.700 --> 07:07.400
for some sort of profit
to-- to buy drugs.

You have nothin' on you?
-No, sir, I don't.

08:45.200 --> 08:46.567
-Are you runnin'
'cause you got warrants?

08:46.600 --> 08:48.200
-No.
-What are you runnin' for?

08:48.233 --> 08:50.067
-I don't know, 'cause
I like you guys. (laughs)

08:50.067 --> 08:52.567
-You hit that car

08:54.133 --> 08:56.400

09:44.100 --> 09:45.933
-All right.
-All right?
Tell me what happened.

09:45.967 --> 09:48.200
He gave me 10 bucks
to give him a drive
to his mom's house.

09:48.233 --> 09:49.900
I didn't even know
what town we were in,

09:49.933 --> 09:51.700
'cause I just moved here
from Wichita.

09:51.733 --> 09:53.333
-Okay.
-And I've been in Lawrence
like a month.

09:53.367 --> 09:55.967
-Okay.
-So, I mean, he put gas in,
and we went there,

09:56.067 --> 09:58.300

10:05.967 --> 10:07.200
What happened next?

10:07.233 --> 10:12.033
-Well, we went by
the trailer park
and nobody answered,

10:12.067 --> 10:13.967
and we were getting ready
to leave.
-Okay. All right.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.533
Um, and what happened?

10:16.567 --> 10:19.067
-He-- He pulled into
that parkin' lot

10:19.100 --> 10:22.000
we were in,
and when you guys
turned your lights on,

10:22.033 --> 10:24.700
he goes, "I'm runnin',"
I was like, "Don't do that,"
I tried to get out then.

10:24.733 --> 10:26.767
-And did you see lights
behind you?
-Yeah.

10:26.800 --> 10:28.600
-Were they red and blue?
-Oh, yeah.

10:28.633 --> 10:30.233
I'll say.
Did you see me punchin'
him in the face,

10:30.267 --> 10:32.067
tryin' to get him to stop?
-No, I didn't see that.

10:32.100 --> 10:35.367
-Well, I did.
-Did you hear
some sirens behind you?

10:35.400 --> 10:37.300
-Well, yes.
-And, uh, he said,
"I'm runnin'"?

10:37.333 --> 10:38.867
-Yep.
-And what'd you say?

10:38.900 --> 10:41.133
-I said, "Don't you (bleep)
dare, let me out,
and I opened the door.

10:41.167 --> 10:43.433
-And what did he say?
-He-- He curved around
the corner real quick.

10:43.467 --> 10:44.633
I kept tellin' him to pull over.

10:44.667 --> 10:46.233
-'Kay, and what was
he sayin'?
-I was like,

10:46.267 --> 10:48.133
they're not gonna stop
chasin' you, you're a dumbass.

10:48.167 --> 10:50.667
Pull over.
I mean, and he wouldn't do it.

10:50.700 --> 10:52.667
And I tried to get out
once when he was slowed down,

10:52.700 --> 10:55.067
around that corner.
-Yeah, yeah, I remember, we saw
your door come open.

10:55.100 --> 10:56.500
-Yeah.
-And then what happened?

10:56.533 --> 10:59.100
-He wouldn't do it,
so I started punchin' him
in the face.

10:59.133 --> 11:01.933
I was like, it's my (bleep)
truck, you need to pull over.
-And what was he sayin'?

11:01.967 --> 11:04.067
-He was like, what are you,
fightin' on the highway,
quit it.

11:04.067 --> 11:06.700
-Okay.
And so he never said
why he was runnin'

11:06.733 --> 11:08.200
or nothin', he just said,
I'm runnin'.

11:08.233 --> 11:10.100
He wouldn't let you out, or--
-No, he wouldn't
let me out.

11:10.133 --> 11:11.200
-Were you scared?
-Yes.

11:11.233 --> 11:13.700
-How scared?
-Very scared, man.

11:13.733 --> 11:15.133
-Scared for your life?
-Yes.

11:15.167 --> 11:17.067
-Did you think
you were gonna die
if somethin' bad happened?

11:17.100 --> 11:21.900
-I mean, yeah,
you can flip a--
it's a-- yeah.

11:21.933 --> 11:25.967
(laughs)
No, I'm not-- No.
I c-- I can't believe

11:26.067 --> 11:28.167
he did that.
-Okay.
All right, we'll probably

11:28.200 --> 11:30.133
be gettin' you
out of those cuffs here
pretty quick, okay?

11:30.167 --> 11:32.067
Um, did he say
why he stopped?

11:32.067 --> 11:34.333
Or did the car
just come to a stop?

11:34.367 --> 11:37.067
-Well, the tire went flat,
and I was like, you (bleep)
my rim up,

11:37.067 --> 11:38.700
I wanna start punchin'
you again. (laughs)

11:38.733 --> 11:39.867
-Okay.
-Uhhh.

11:39.900 --> 11:42.933
-Hey, Sharp?
How'd it start, man?

11:42.967 --> 11:45.367
-I had a leaving the scene
accident earlier,

11:45.400 --> 11:47.667
at Casey's, in town
at 303 East End.

11:47.700 --> 11:51.467
Um, the vehicle left.
Went after the vehicle.

11:51.500 --> 11:55.100
Uh, I was drivin' around,
saw it, leavin' the Quik shop,
-Yeah.

11:55.133 --> 11:57.500
went to stop it
and he took off on me.

11:57.533 --> 11:59.633
So.
Saw the damage
on the driver's side,

11:59.667 --> 12:02.067
which was--
-Consistent...

12:02.100 --> 12:03.600
-consistent with what I had
on the other car.

12:03.633 --> 12:05.267
-Sure.
-I arrested him
earlier this week.

12:05.300 --> 12:06.467
-Right on.

12:06.500 --> 12:08.967
-Hey, Jackie, here's
the deal, man.

12:09.067 --> 12:12.900
Um, tonight your charges
are gonna be leaving the scene
of an accident,

12:12.933 --> 12:19.100
failing to report an accident,
felony flee and elude,
and, uh, reckless driving.

12:19.133 --> 12:20.500
-All right.
-Okay?
Jackie...

12:20.533 --> 12:23.133
-Yeah?
-This is the second time
in one week

12:23.167 --> 12:24.433
I've arrested you.

12:24.467 --> 12:26.633
Whatever's goin on,
you gotta fix it.

12:26.667 --> 12:28.767
-Right.
-I don't wanna see you
any more.

12:28.800 --> 12:30.167
-Yeah.
-Are we clear?

12:30.200 --> 12:31.800
All right.

12:34.100 --> 12:36.633
Amy?
We're gonna get you
out of the handcuffs, okay?

12:36.667 --> 12:39.200
And we're gonna get you
a ride back to the city,
so why don't you step on out

12:39.233 --> 12:42.167
for me.
Face the car for me, okay?

12:42.200 --> 12:44.867
Hey, here's your purse.

12:44.900 --> 12:48.167
-Okay.
-So, uh, your friend Jackie's
goin' to jail, obviously.

12:48.200 --> 12:51.833
-Right...
-Or maybe not a friend
anymore, huh?

12:51.867 --> 12:54.967
-(laughs)
No, I'm-- I'm good with that.

12:55.067 --> 12:57.067
-So, did he ever
physically keep you
from gettin' out,

12:57.067 --> 12:59.433
or-- or he just say
don't get out, or what?

12:59.467 --> 13:02.900
-He told me to quit
freakin' out, I don't know
he ever put his hands on me.

13:02.933 --> 13:05.900
-Okay.
We are gonna get you back
to the-- the shelter

13:05.933 --> 13:08.433
in Lawrence, okay?
-Thank you.

13:10.867 --> 13:14.167
-I was born and raised
in Colorado, and throughout
the years on the job

13:14.200 --> 13:18.067
I've found it to be important
to have hobbies outside of work.

13:18.067 --> 13:20.767
Keeps you stress-free,
and it takes your mind
off the job

13:20.800 --> 13:22.533
when you're on your weekend.

13:22.567 --> 13:23.967
And Colorado has a lot to offer,

13:24.067 --> 13:25.433
especially up in the mountains,

13:25.467 --> 13:28.067
so during the wintertime,
I like to snowboard,

13:28.067 --> 13:30.133
and during the summertime
I enjoy hiking and camping

13:30.167 --> 13:31.333
and fishing.

13:31.367 --> 13:34.300
And I'm definitely lucky
to, uh, both live and work

13:34.333 --> 13:35.767
here in Colorado.

13:35.800 --> 13:38.400
-(siren blips)

13:38.433 --> 13:43.067
-Uh, got behind this white sedan
here, and occupants keep
lookin' back at me.

13:43.067 --> 13:45.433
They've taken a couple
weird turns here,

13:45.467 --> 13:48.067
and looks like the tag
on this vehicle

13:48.100 --> 13:52.133
does not come back
to this car here.

13:52.167 --> 13:56.367
So I'm gonna make a stop
on the car and see what's
goin' on with it.

14:03.067 --> 14:05.400
-How you guys doin'?
-Good, and yourself?

14:05.433 --> 14:06.700
-Good, where are you guys
comin' from?

14:06.733 --> 14:11.167
-Um, from... well, from Pecos,
64th and Pecos.

14:11.200 --> 14:13.700
-Okay.
And where you guys
goin' to?

14:13.733 --> 14:18.100
-Well, ac-- actually right now
I'm waitin' for a friend.
He's supposed to give me

14:18.133 --> 14:19.700
some money
that he owed me, so.

14:19.733 --> 14:21.733
-Okay.
Do you know where
you're at right now?

14:21.767 --> 14:24.267
-Mmm... GPS'd it.

14:24.300 --> 14:26.767
-Something like 63rd, isn't it?

14:26.800 --> 14:30.567
-Pecos is right here.
I'm not exactly sure exactly
what street this is, but...

14:30.600 --> 14:33.667
-Okay, 'cause the plate doesn't
come back to this thing,
first of all.

14:33.700 --> 14:35.400
Second of all, you guys
don't know where you're at.

14:35.433 --> 14:37.467
You're not coming in here
to get any money from
any friends.

14:37.500 --> 14:39.667
-No, sir, we actually are.
He lives right here, but...

14:39.700 --> 14:41.833
-What's his name?
-Jose.

14:41.867 --> 14:43.667
-Okay. Can you have
Jose come out?

14:43.700 --> 14:45.933
-Yeah. Hopefully he answers.

14:45.967 --> 14:47.800
-Yeah, hopefully
he does answer,

14:47.833 --> 14:51.300
'cause I'm almost willing
to bet money that Jose
doesn't live here.

14:51.333 --> 14:52.833
You guys have IDs?

14:52.867 --> 14:54.900
-No, I lost--
I lost my wallet.
-How--

14:54.933 --> 14:57.867
How old are you?
-Um, I'm nineteen.

14:57.900 --> 15:00.200
-I can give you my,
my name and everything, uh...

15:00.233 --> 15:01.800
-How old are you?
-Uh, twenty-one.

15:01.833 --> 15:03.367
-How old are you?
-Fifteen.

15:03.400 --> 15:06.333
-He's fifteen.
-He's my-- he's my younger
brother, little brother.

15:06.367 --> 15:07.800
-Okay, what I'm gonna do,

15:07.833 --> 15:09.867
is I'm gonna pull
each and every one of you out,
one at a time,

15:09.900 --> 15:12.267
and I'm gonna make sure
nobody has any weapons
or drugs on them, okay?

15:12.300 --> 15:14.367
In the meantime,
I want your rear passengers

15:14.400 --> 15:16.500
to put your hands up
on the headrest right here.

15:19.767 --> 15:21.800
Keep your hands
where I can see them.
Come over here.

15:21.833 --> 15:24.833
Come here. Turn around
and interlace your fingers
on the back of your head.

15:25.900 --> 15:27.633
Spread your feet.

15:30.200 --> 15:32.900
Okay,
go sit down on this curb
right back here.

15:32.933 --> 15:35.467
-(car door opens)
-Come on out.

15:37.900 --> 15:39.900
Okay, go ahead
and have a seat.

15:39.933 --> 15:42.500
Hop over that center console.
Come on out here, partner.

15:45.633 --> 15:47.433
Okay, go ahead and have
a seat with them over there.

15:47.467 --> 15:49.067
-Thank you, sir.

15:55.367 --> 15:56.567
-Oh.

15:58.867 --> 16:02.067
So, this just
fell out of the...

16:02.100 --> 16:03.967
visor.

16:06.167 --> 16:08.167
It's looking like
it's gonna be...

16:08.200 --> 16:10.733
rock cocaine.

16:10.767 --> 16:13.067
This is gonna be
in the driver's care
and control.

16:13.100 --> 16:15.167
Right in the driver's
visor, so...

16:15.200 --> 16:18.200
we'll keep going,
see if we can find
anything else.

16:30.067 --> 16:31.333
This black bag was underneath

16:31.367 --> 16:33.933
the, uh,
front passenger's legs.

16:37.333 --> 16:39.967
Those are probably
gonna be mushrooms.

16:40.067 --> 16:42.433
A scale and baggies,
commonly used

16:42.467 --> 16:45.367
to distribute drugs illicitly
on the streets.

16:48.433 --> 16:51.400
So, they're out selling
mushrooms tonight.

16:51.433 --> 16:54.067
Look what was in that bag
right underneath your feet.

16:54.067 --> 16:56.067
-That isn't mine.

16:56.067 --> 16:58.067
-Look at me.

16:58.067 --> 16:59.833
You're gonna sit here
and tell me...

16:59.867 --> 17:01.433
that none
of that's yours?

17:01.467 --> 17:02.900
-That is not mine, sir.
-It's not?

17:02.933 --> 17:04.200
-Nope.

17:04.233 --> 17:06.500
-You can deny it all you want.
All I have to do,

17:06.533 --> 17:09.700
just to solidify the case
to beyond a reasonable doubt

17:09.733 --> 17:11.467
in front of a judge and jury,

17:11.500 --> 17:13.133
is collect DNA off of it.

17:13.167 --> 17:15.633
I've touched it
with gloved hands.
You haven't.

17:16.833 --> 17:18.100
-True.

17:18.133 --> 17:20.300
-Go ahead and turn around.
Put your hands behind your back.

17:22.067 --> 17:24.967
You're formally being detained.

17:25.067 --> 17:26.567
Search him good
one more time, Sean,

17:26.600 --> 17:28.133
and stick him in your car.

17:29.267 --> 17:31.500
Hey, driver,
come over here.

17:31.533 --> 17:32.833
All right, what's your name?
-Oscar.

17:32.867 --> 17:35.267
-Oscar? Okay.
Have you ever been
arrested, Oscar?

17:35.300 --> 17:36.767
-No.

17:36.800 --> 17:38.667
-You're looking...

17:38.700 --> 17:41.100
at a pretty big
heap of charges,
right now,

17:41.133 --> 17:43.267
after what I found
inside of that car.

17:43.300 --> 17:46.233
They're all felonies
and they're all drug charges.

17:46.267 --> 17:48.067
Let's talk about the cocaine.

17:48.067 --> 17:50.300
What's the deal with it?

17:50.333 --> 17:52.800
-Where did you find it?
-In your visor.

17:54.733 --> 17:57.067
-Then it's a--

17:57.067 --> 17:59.300
That, I'm gonna tell you
the truth, is mine.

17:59.333 --> 18:01.067
-Okay.
-It is.

18:01.067 --> 18:02.700
-I appreciate you
admitting that.

18:02.733 --> 18:04.067
All right, man,
come over here.

18:04.100 --> 18:05.433
I'm gonna place you
into custody.

18:05.467 --> 18:08.633
-(radio chatter)

18:13.267 --> 18:15.533
-(clears throat)
All right, man,

18:15.567 --> 18:17.133
that's your little brother
in the car?

18:17.167 --> 18:19.333
-Yeah, Domingo.

18:19.367 --> 18:20.867
-Okay, how old is he?

18:20.900 --> 18:22.667
-He's, uh, fifteen, sir.

18:22.700 --> 18:24.567
-You want him out here
dealing drugs on the street?

18:24.600 --> 18:26.200
-No, sir.

18:26.233 --> 18:30.233
-Driving around Adams County
at 12:30, 1:00 in the morning
dealing drugs?

18:31.533 --> 18:33.767
He looks up to you, man.

18:33.800 --> 18:35.633
The mushrooms are yours, right?

18:35.667 --> 18:37.833
You man up and you own it,

18:37.867 --> 18:40.200
or I have to look at
possibly charging you

18:40.233 --> 18:41.867
with Contributing
to the Delinquency of a Minor,

18:41.900 --> 18:43.433
which is another felony,

18:43.467 --> 18:46.567
and place him
into child protective custody.

18:46.600 --> 18:48.467
-I don't want that.

18:48.500 --> 18:50.667
-So is the bag yours?

18:50.700 --> 18:53.533
-Is he gonna go home
with my mother?

18:53.567 --> 18:55.733
-Yup.
-You promise me that?

18:55.767 --> 18:57.500
-Hundred percent.

18:57.533 --> 19:00.100
-You're a man of your word?
-I'm a man of my word, man.

19:00.133 --> 19:04.067
-That's my bag.
-Okay.

19:04.067 --> 19:06.467
I'm wearing a badge, dude.
I took an oath.
I don't lie to people.

19:06.500 --> 19:08.333
-All right.
I appreciate you

19:08.367 --> 19:10.767
for getting my brother
home safely, sir.

19:10.800 --> 19:13.900
-I'll get your brother home
because you owned up to it.

19:13.933 --> 19:15.733
-Thank you.

19:15.767 --> 19:19.267
-You feel like you let him down?
-Yeah, big time.

19:19.300 --> 19:21.800
As well as my son.

19:21.833 --> 19:23.067
-You have a son?

19:23.067 --> 19:26.067
-Yeah, he's gonna be one
in July.

19:26.100 --> 19:27.933
-And where's your son
right now?

19:27.967 --> 19:29.500
-He's with his mother.

19:29.533 --> 19:31.967
We share 50/50 custody.

19:33.300 --> 19:36.200
-All right.
Well, at this point,

19:36.233 --> 19:37.800
you're gonna be going
to jail tonight

19:37.833 --> 19:41.067
for possession of a Schedule I
controlled substance

19:41.100 --> 19:42.800
with the intent to distribute.

19:42.833 --> 19:44.700
But I think for the future,

19:44.733 --> 19:46.067
I think you and I
can both agree

19:46.067 --> 19:48.433
this is gonna be a pretty good
learning lesson for you.

19:49.567 --> 19:51.733
-132 and Bush,
I've got him at gunpoint.

19:51.767 --> 19:53.700
-Dispatcher:
Okay, gunpoint, 132 and Bush.

19:53.733 --> 19:54.867
Cover is code three.

19:54.900 --> 19:57.867
-(overlapping
police radio chatter)
