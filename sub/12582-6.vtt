00:32.849 --> 00:37.986
Hey, guys, how do I
look on this one, huh?

00:38.021 --> 00:40.546
We're not here to joyride
the toilets, Dale.

00:40.590 --> 00:42.114
If you can't get enough fun

00:42.158 --> 00:44.558
out of helping me buy
new handle bushings,

00:44.594 --> 00:47.154
there is something
seriously wrong with you.

00:51.234 --> 00:53.361
Hey, Hank Hill.

00:53.403 --> 00:55.030
What were you doing
in plumbing aisle?

00:55.071 --> 00:56.470
Need new crescent moon stencil

00:56.506 --> 00:58.371
for outhouse?

00:59.509 --> 01:01.204
I'm doing
home improvements, Kahn.

01:01.244 --> 01:02.905
Aw! Trying to improve
your home

01:02.946 --> 01:04.846
like putting lingerie
on a monkey.

01:04.881 --> 01:07.372
Better to save up
all your dog-fighting money

01:07.417 --> 01:09.647
and buy ticket
to Arlen Parade of Homes.

01:09.686 --> 01:11.017
I'll have you know

01:11.054 --> 01:13.989
that my house is
part of Texas history.

01:14.023 --> 01:16.719
Yep. It was built
by the great-grandson

01:16.760 --> 01:18.785
of Captain
T. Anderson Kearney

01:18.828 --> 01:21.626
who fired the first shot
at the Battle of Gonzalez.

01:21.664 --> 01:25.464
Hey, maybe I should enter
my house in the Parade of Homes.

01:25.502 --> 01:28.665
Hey, who forgot to
change the toilet paper?

01:30.573 --> 01:34.202
You know, this closet
would look a lot bigger

01:34.244 --> 01:37.577
if you took out my shoes and
replaced them with Nancy's.

01:37.614 --> 01:40.105
Well, we don't need any
Hollywood special effects

01:40.150 --> 01:42.584
for people to see what
a great house we've got.

01:42.619 --> 01:43.950
Hey, maybe we can put

01:43.987 --> 01:47.582
T. Anderson Kearney's brass
boot remover by the door.

01:47.624 --> 01:50.821
Kind of an exclamation point
for when people leave the room.

01:50.860 --> 01:52.691
Talkin' about ol'
house beautiful, man,

01:52.729 --> 01:55.027
talking' 'bout dang ol'
swim-up no bed pool, man.

01:55.064 --> 01:57.555
Talkin' 'bout just like dang
ol' Wilt the Stilt, man,

01:57.600 --> 01:59.295
see no double teams
in his day, man.

01:59.335 --> 02:00.700
Well, thanks, Boomhauer.

02:00.737 --> 02:03.205
I just hope the people
on the Parade of Homes

02:03.239 --> 02:04.729
say the same thing.

02:08.044 --> 02:10.274
Welcome to the Bobby Hill Room.

02:10.312 --> 02:13.976
No flash photography
on the trolls, please.

02:17.854 --> 02:22.086
Uh, hey, uh, Bobby, you know
what might spruce this room up?

02:22.125 --> 02:25.492
A nice display case for
your troll action figures,

02:25.528 --> 02:27.052
with solid wood doors.

02:27.096 --> 02:30.554
You know, so people won't
be tempted to steal them.

02:30.600 --> 02:31.794
Okay.

02:31.835 --> 02:34.497
Um, aren't they called
troll <i>dolls?</i>

02:34.537 --> 02:37.005
Yes.

02:37.040 --> 02:38.405
Now, watch closely, Bobby.

02:38.441 --> 02:40.432
This house is going
to be yours someday

02:40.476 --> 02:43.445
and you're going to need
to know how to take care of it.

02:43.479 --> 02:46.414
Can you hammer in a nail
with a single blow?

02:46.449 --> 02:48.474
This isn't a circus, Bobby.

02:48.518 --> 02:50.008
But I could.

02:55.191 --> 02:56.681
Dad, help me!

02:56.726 --> 02:59.490
Help me!
I'm drowning!

03:04.334 --> 03:06.700
Oh, Bobby,
you'd had such a good few years.

03:06.736 --> 03:07.725
I wasn't me.

03:07.770 --> 03:08.862
The wall's leaking.

03:13.843 --> 03:15.310
Good Lord,

03:15.345 --> 03:17.506
it looks like it's
coming right out of the stud.

03:18.815 --> 03:20.339
It's okay.

03:20.383 --> 03:21.907
It's okay, babies.

03:21.951 --> 03:23.248
Daddy's here.

03:23.286 --> 03:26.153
Now, let's get you
out of these wet clothes.

03:34.230 --> 03:35.697
What kind of

03:35.732 --> 03:38.599
a sick bastard runs a water pipe
through a stud

03:38.635 --> 03:40.068
without installing a nail guard?

03:40.103 --> 03:42.264
I don't know!

03:44.040 --> 03:46.235
Well, the water damage
looks pretty minor.

03:46.276 --> 03:49.302
Yeah, at Lone Star Home and
Casualty we see some doozies.

03:49.345 --> 03:52.337
The Matthew McConaughey "water
weenie" claim comes to mind.

03:52.382 --> 03:54.782
Yeah, well, about my wall...

03:54.817 --> 03:55.977
Don't worry, Mr. Hill.

03:56.019 --> 03:57.782
We'll hire someone
to come in here

03:57.820 --> 03:59.185
and get this wall fixed up

03:59.222 --> 04:00.951
before that Parade
of Homes tour.

04:00.990 --> 04:04.448
Uh, I don't really like
strangers touching my walls.

04:04.494 --> 04:06.018
Maybe you could just pay me

04:06.062 --> 04:08.292
and I'll get the supplies
and fix it myself.

04:08.331 --> 04:10.356
Sorry, but company
regulations require

04:10.400 --> 04:12.527
we use licensed
and bonded contractors.

04:12.568 --> 04:14.229
But I can absolutely
assure you

04:14.270 --> 04:15.464
they do
a first-rate job.

04:15.505 --> 04:17.632
Okay.

04:17.673 --> 04:20.074
Now, would you like to be tested
for mold while we're at it?

04:20.108 --> 04:22.100
We usually do one after
any type of water damage.

04:22.145 --> 04:23.373
Won't cost you anything.

04:23.413 --> 04:24.903
I guess. Sure, go ahead.

04:25.949 --> 04:27.143
Excuse me.

04:27.183 --> 04:29.651
Do I need to file a claim
for my loss?

04:29.686 --> 04:31.085
Yeah, uh...

04:31.120 --> 04:34.214
you're going to have to give
those to the insurance company

04:34.257 --> 04:35.986
so they can assess them
properly.

04:36.025 --> 04:39.119
I'm sure you know what to do
with them.

04:40.730 --> 04:43.426
<i>Don't leave any excess
joint compound</i>

04:43.466 --> 04:45.730
on the threads, and always wipe
the pipes down

04:45.768 --> 04:48.362
when you're done as a courtesy to
the next plumber.

04:48.404 --> 04:50.736
Now, let's see if that
outlet needs rewiring.

04:50.773 --> 04:51.967
I'll do it.

04:52.008 --> 04:54.374
Just, uh, hand me
that volt meter.

04:57.313 --> 04:59.281
Hi, I'm Steve Goodman.

04:59.315 --> 05:01.943
I'm here to check the room
for mold.

05:04.187 --> 05:07.384
Huh, so that's what
you use to test for it.

05:07.423 --> 05:09.584
Boy, I've never seen
one of those before.

05:09.625 --> 05:11.718
You think I could
give it a try, Steve?

05:11.761 --> 05:13.490
Nope.

05:13.529 --> 05:15.360
I'm done here.

05:16.799 --> 05:19.427
Okay, who wants to turn off
the circuit breaker?

05:19.469 --> 05:21.027
Too late. I call it.

05:23.139 --> 05:26.438
Now remember, Hank, the Parade
of Homes is not a competition.

05:26.476 --> 05:28.944
But this is what
we're up against.

05:30.480 --> 05:31.811
That's pretty nice
for new construction.

05:31.848 --> 05:32.906
Can I...

05:32.949 --> 05:34.541
help you?

05:34.584 --> 05:38.350
Uh, yeah, we're in
the Parade of Homes next week, too.

05:38.388 --> 05:40.856
Hank Hill, single-
story, ranch-style.

05:40.890 --> 05:42.858
We were just admiring
your place.

05:42.892 --> 05:44.154
Nice shutters.

05:44.193 --> 05:45.524
Well, thanks.

05:45.561 --> 05:47.791
That means a lot coming
from another parader.

05:47.830 --> 05:50.492
Still trying to get the place
looking presentable.

05:50.533 --> 05:52.694
It's funny,
I spent my whole life

05:52.735 --> 05:55.101
dreaming about
owning my own house.

05:55.138 --> 05:57.470
Now all I dream about
is the next thing

05:57.507 --> 06:00.499
that needs to be painted
or polished or replaced.

06:00.543 --> 06:02.704
I love those dreams.

06:04.247 --> 06:06.442
I hate to toot my own horn,

06:06.482 --> 06:08.382
but this wall
looks pretty good.

06:08.418 --> 06:10.010
Let's enjoy it now

06:10.053 --> 06:13.580
before Bobby puts up that poster
of babies dressed as strawberries.

06:15.725 --> 06:18.057
Hank, it's
our first looky-loo.

06:20.329 --> 06:21.921
Okay, be cool.

06:24.100 --> 06:25.761
Welcome.

06:25.802 --> 06:27.360
Knocks pretty nice,
doesn't she?

06:27.403 --> 06:29.234
That's solid oak hardwood.

06:29.272 --> 06:30.796
No pressed filler there.

06:30.840 --> 06:32.273
Now notice the...

06:32.308 --> 06:34.071
Whoa, whoa, whoa, you
might want to save that

06:34.110 --> 06:35.543
for someone who's
not on the clock.

06:35.578 --> 06:37.011
I'm Rob Holguin,
Techno-Pure.

06:37.046 --> 06:38.638
Your insurance
company sent me.

06:38.681 --> 06:39.943
Oh, uh, Hank Hill.

06:39.982 --> 06:41.574
What can I do for you?

06:41.617 --> 06:42.811
You can put your hand down

06:42.852 --> 06:44.342
and step two feet
away from me.

06:44.387 --> 06:46.048
You may be contaminated.

06:46.089 --> 06:48.956
What? Your house has
tested positive for mold.

06:48.991 --> 06:50.015
Aah!

06:50.059 --> 06:51.287
Yeah, uh, you might not want

06:51.327 --> 06:52.726
to take such deep breaths.

06:59.769 --> 07:01.430
I've got mold?

07:01.471 --> 07:02.665
Well, that can't...

07:02.705 --> 07:04.332
I mean... how does...

07:04.373 --> 07:05.601
God, is it hot in here?

07:05.641 --> 07:07.165
I'm really hot.

07:07.210 --> 07:10.179
Uh, Mrs. Hill, maybe you
could get him a chair.

07:10.213 --> 07:12.340
I'm going to make a small
exploratory incision

07:12.381 --> 07:13.507
so I can have

07:13.549 --> 07:16.643
a little look-see here.

07:18.654 --> 07:22.715
Thar she blows, my great
green whale Aspergillus.

07:22.758 --> 07:24.555
You're lucky
you caught this leak early

07:24.594 --> 07:26.152
before this mold really spread.

07:26.195 --> 07:29.790
I've got green stuff
inside my walls and I'm lucky?

07:29.832 --> 07:31.163
Relax, Mr. Hill.

07:31.200 --> 07:33.065
Rob Holguin is going to do
everything it takes

07:33.102 --> 07:34.501
to get rid of this mold,

07:34.537 --> 07:36.198
and you're insurance is going
to pick up the tab.

07:36.239 --> 07:37.900
Everything
from frictional irrigation

07:37.940 --> 07:39.703
with a concentrated
chlorine solution,

07:39.742 --> 07:41.903
to forced atmospheric
dehydration.

07:41.944 --> 07:44.674
So wait. You're saying you're
going to rub it with bleach

07:44.714 --> 07:45.976
and then blow it dry?

07:47.016 --> 07:48.540
Well, in layman's terms, yes.

07:48.584 --> 07:50.245
Well, I've got some bleach
and a fan.

07:50.286 --> 07:51.719
I could probably do it myself.

07:53.122 --> 07:54.885
Every joker with a bottle
of Clorox and a Vornado

07:54.924 --> 07:55.948
thinks he's an expert.

07:55.992 --> 07:57.220
Look, unless the job is done

07:57.260 --> 07:59.694
by a certified mold expert,
such as myself,

07:59.729 --> 08:02.493
your insurance company
will drop you like, well...

08:02.532 --> 08:06.024
I'd drop this, but then
there'd be mold on your floor.

08:06.068 --> 08:07.365
Hank, let him do it.

08:07.403 --> 08:08.995
He's a professional.

08:09.038 --> 08:10.835
Can you guys get it
done in two days?

08:10.873 --> 08:13.273
This house is on
the Parade of Homes.

08:13.309 --> 08:15.436
This is the kind of thing
they take a picture of

08:15.478 --> 08:17.241
and put it on
their blooper reel.

08:17.280 --> 08:20.215
Well, lucky for you,
Aspergillus is my specialty.

08:20.249 --> 08:23.241
I should have it
calling me daddy in no time.

08:23.286 --> 08:25.481
So are we okay
to stay here like this?

08:25.521 --> 08:26.715
Okay?

08:26.756 --> 08:28.724
Well, that's a medical question,
Mrs. Hill.

08:28.758 --> 08:30.453
I'm not a medical doctor.

08:30.493 --> 08:32.154
Now I'll need you both to sign
this waiver

08:32.195 --> 08:34.595
which certifies I've informed
you that's a medical question

08:34.630 --> 08:35.892
and I'm not a medical doctor.

08:42.104 --> 08:44.834
Hank, listen to this:

08:44.874 --> 08:47.866
"Mold has been known to cause
itchiness, asthma,

08:47.910 --> 08:49.741
chronic fatigue
and disorientation."

08:49.779 --> 08:51.906
Bobby, quick, what's
your middle name, huh?

08:51.948 --> 08:53.313
When's my birthday?

08:53.349 --> 08:54.543
Here, follow my finger.

08:54.584 --> 08:56.245
Your birthday is...
I don't know!

08:56.285 --> 08:57.445
Hank, the mold's got him!

08:57.486 --> 08:59.113
Help me, Dad!

08:59.155 --> 09:01.487
Oh, will you two
just calm down?

09:01.524 --> 09:04.049
Now it's just a little
patch of mold.

09:04.093 --> 09:05.617
We'll let Holguin do his job

09:05.661 --> 09:07.185
and everything will be fine.

09:07.230 --> 09:09.391
And the boy never knew
your birthday, Peggy.

09:09.432 --> 09:11.332
He always just
piggybacked on my card.

09:16.272 --> 09:18.206
Yep.

09:18.241 --> 09:19.208
Yep.

09:19.242 --> 09:21.107
Mm-hmm.

09:23.279 --> 09:24.439
Yep.

09:24.480 --> 09:26.573
Dale, take
that dang thing off.

09:26.616 --> 09:28.914
We're perfectly safe
here in the alley.

09:28.951 --> 09:31.920
Heck, we'd all be perfectly safe
if we slept in Bobby's room.

09:31.954 --> 09:33.182
A sleep-over?

09:33.222 --> 09:34.280
I'll get my jammies.

09:34.323 --> 09:35.654
Don't let him in, Hank.

09:35.691 --> 09:37.056
With his foot fungus,

09:37.093 --> 09:39.527
he'd just be tracking
more mold into the house.

09:39.562 --> 09:41.291
That area between his toes

09:41.330 --> 09:43.890
is as rich and fertile
as the Nile River Delta.

09:43.933 --> 09:45.730
Can we still have
the sleep-over?

09:45.768 --> 09:47.565
I'll hang my feet
out the window.

09:47.603 --> 09:49.230
Attention,

09:49.272 --> 09:51.638
mold patient zero.

09:51.674 --> 09:53.801
I know your house not good
enough for Parade of Home.

09:53.843 --> 09:58.075
Maybe next month,
Parade of Toxic Waste Dumps.

10:03.719 --> 10:05.016
<i>What?</i>

10:05.054 --> 10:06.351
How could we still have mold?

10:06.389 --> 10:08.084
I thought you said
you got rid of it.

10:08.124 --> 10:09.591
I did, from the leak.

10:09.625 --> 10:10.853
But there must be

10:10.893 --> 10:12.383
a secondary infestation.

10:12.428 --> 10:14.259
The latest sample from this room

10:14.297 --> 10:17.698
showed an airborne mold level
of 500 parts per cubic meter.

10:18.701 --> 10:19.668
Ah!

10:19.702 --> 10:21.329
Hmm, nothing.

10:25.708 --> 10:27.039
What are you doing?

10:27.076 --> 10:29.806
I can't get rid
of this other mold

10:29.845 --> 10:31.904
until I find it,
Mr. Hill.

10:31.947 --> 10:33.574
And insurance regulations
require

10:33.616 --> 10:35.641
that we reduce the level
of mold in here

10:35.685 --> 10:37.619
to that found in
the air outdoors.

10:37.653 --> 10:39.712
400 parts per cubic meter.

10:39.755 --> 10:42.781
400? Bobby, quick, get inside!

10:42.825 --> 10:44.315
No, no, I mean, stay outside!

10:44.360 --> 10:45.622
Get... get...

10:45.661 --> 10:46.855
get in the car

10:46.896 --> 10:48.693
and turn on the
air conditioner, now!

10:48.731 --> 10:50.494
Mrs. Hill, Mrs. Hill,
it's okay.

10:50.533 --> 10:54.492
400 parts per cubic meter
is like a fly speck in a Big Gulp cup.

10:54.537 --> 10:57.904
Wait, wait, it sounds like
there's almost no difference

10:57.940 --> 11:00.033
between the air in here
and the air outside.

11:00.076 --> 11:01.270
What's the problem?

11:01.310 --> 11:02.834
Uh, I could try
and explain it to you,

11:02.878 --> 11:04.402
but if you want
this place ready

11:04.447 --> 11:05.971
in time for that
Parade of Homes,

11:06.015 --> 11:07.505
it would probably
make more sense

11:07.550 --> 11:08.710
for me to just do my job.

11:11.020 --> 11:13.580
Thank God. I thought
this thing was broken.

11:19.095 --> 11:22.121
There's the culprit...
Alterneria.

11:22.164 --> 11:23.722
You're not so tough now

11:23.766 --> 11:26.234
without your buddy Stachybotrys,
are you?

11:26.268 --> 11:28.099
Are you sure that's even mold?

11:28.137 --> 11:30.196
It could just be
an old dust bunny.

11:30.239 --> 11:31.866
I wish it were a dust bunny.

11:31.907 --> 11:34.398
In fact, I wish this whole damn
wall were full of real bunnies,

11:34.443 --> 11:37.071
but this looks like mold
that's been here for 20 years.

11:37.113 --> 11:39.411
What's on the other
side of this wall?

11:39.448 --> 11:41.382
Our bedroom!

11:44.453 --> 11:47.115
Remember that night I
thought I heard something

11:47.156 --> 11:48.748
and you said it was nothing?

11:48.791 --> 11:49.985
Well, thank you.

11:50.025 --> 11:52.186
You just signed
my death warrant.

11:52.228 --> 11:55.755
If we've been sleeping in this
room with mold for 20 years,

11:55.798 --> 11:58.699
how come we've never
had itching or asthma

11:58.734 --> 12:00.725
or any of those other
problems we read about?

12:00.770 --> 12:03.705
Well, that's probably because
the government hasn't found

12:03.739 --> 12:05.331
a scientific link between mold

12:05.374 --> 12:07.239
and any known
health problems... yet.

12:07.276 --> 12:10.143
Then why do you keep
banging holes in my walls?

12:10.179 --> 12:13.580
Because I'm the hunter,
and mold is my antelope.

12:13.616 --> 12:15.743
And if I don't bang
holes in your wall,

12:15.785 --> 12:17.844
my conscience bangs
holes in my head.

12:17.887 --> 12:20.253
Holguin here.
I need backup.

12:20.289 --> 12:22.382
I got a bi-room situation
at Rainey Street.

12:29.398 --> 12:31.923
Hey, scrape that out
more carefully, will you?

12:31.967 --> 12:33.559
It's a wall, not a pumpkin.
Whoa, whoa.

12:33.602 --> 12:35.763
You're going to have to
stay out of the hot zone.

12:35.805 --> 12:37.830
That's both bedrooms
and the master bath.

12:37.873 --> 12:39.067
But where are we going to...

12:39.108 --> 12:40.132
Automatic ice maker.

12:40.176 --> 12:41.165
Oh, boy.

12:41.210 --> 12:42.700
What?
What, oh, boy?

12:42.745 --> 12:43.871
Seal off the kitchen.

12:43.913 --> 12:45.039
Now hold on.

12:45.080 --> 12:46.547
This is getting...
Dog house is hot!

12:46.582 --> 12:47.742
Aspergillus.

12:47.783 --> 12:49.410
All right, that does it.

12:49.452 --> 12:50.817
Everybody out, now.

12:55.291 --> 12:56.280
Hey, hold on.

12:56.325 --> 12:57.292
I said stop.

12:57.326 --> 12:58.293
Mr. Hill,

12:58.327 --> 12:59.658
I understand you're upset,

12:59.695 --> 13:01.686
but you really don't
want us out of your house.

13:01.730 --> 13:03.027
Yes, I do.

13:03.065 --> 13:05.795
Okay, but if I get
on this walkie-talkie

13:05.835 --> 13:07.564
and call in a Code Charlie,

13:07.603 --> 13:10.663
my guys'll be out of here
in 36 seconds flat.

13:10.706 --> 13:12.367
That's how long it'll
take for your house

13:12.408 --> 13:13.875
to become worthless.
What?

13:13.909 --> 13:15.900
Look, you've been informed
there's mold in this house,

13:15.945 --> 13:18.038
which means if you ever want
to sell this property...

13:18.080 --> 13:19.377
I don't want to sell.

13:19.415 --> 13:22.179
I plan on passing this
house down to my son.

13:22.218 --> 13:24.345
Ooh, goodie gumdrops.
Thanks, Dad.

13:24.386 --> 13:26.149
A worthless mold house!

13:28.924 --> 13:30.755
Do you have any
pet birds, Mr. Hill?

13:30.793 --> 13:31.817
No.

13:31.861 --> 13:32.885
Good.

13:37.299 --> 13:40.029
Can three family members
share a living room

13:40.069 --> 13:42.094
without driving
each other crazy?

13:43.339 --> 13:44.738
Booby, I've asked you
several times

13:44.773 --> 13:46.400
to stop making that joke.

13:46.442 --> 13:48.034
Now, go to your room.

13:51.647 --> 13:53.410
...18, 19, 20.

13:53.449 --> 13:55.144
Mr. Hill, you've
got to get out.

13:55.184 --> 13:56.776
Aah! You get out!

13:56.819 --> 13:58.252
Your whole house
is contaminated.

13:58.287 --> 14:00.312
The neg air environment's
been compromised.

14:00.356 --> 14:02.290
The what? There's
no time to explain

14:02.324 --> 14:04.292
how it wasn't my
fault... now move!

14:04.326 --> 14:06.157
That towel could be
filthy with mold.

14:06.195 --> 14:07.856
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

14:10.566 --> 14:13.228
Forget the toys, the insurance
company will pay for everything.

14:13.269 --> 14:14.236
Now move!

14:17.139 --> 14:19.198
Leave it to you

14:19.241 --> 14:22.074
to make a hospital gown
look unsexy, Hank.

14:26.615 --> 14:29.277
This says 123 Rainey Street.

14:29.318 --> 14:31.650
This is on
the Parade of Homes?

14:31.687 --> 14:33.882
That can't be right.

14:33.923 --> 14:35.015
Hank?

14:35.057 --> 14:37.457
Oh, God, no,
the Parade of Homes.

14:37.493 --> 14:39.256
Is today the fifth?

14:39.295 --> 14:40.922
Uh...

14:40.963 --> 14:42.954
this ranch style rambler,

14:42.998 --> 14:46.695
with upgrades to the doors
and windows and roof,

14:46.735 --> 14:48.202
uh, was built

14:48.237 --> 14:50.637
by the great
grandson of, uh...

14:50.673 --> 14:52.698
T...

14:52.741 --> 14:53.969
Smile, Hank.

14:54.009 --> 14:57.137
I want to get a picture
of you next to the mold.

15:20.536 --> 15:22.970
I know, girl, I know.

15:25.040 --> 15:26.371
Hey, what do you know?

15:26.408 --> 15:28.308
Erin Brockovich has got mold.

15:28.344 --> 15:29.834
And Ed McMahon.

15:29.878 --> 15:32.278
Oh, it killed his dog, Muffin.

15:32.314 --> 15:34.612
Maybe we'll meet them
at a survivors group.

15:34.650 --> 15:36.311
If Lone Star Home and Casualty

15:36.352 --> 15:38.513
is so interested
in looking for mold,

15:38.554 --> 15:40.146
you should start with this room.

15:40.189 --> 15:42.089
It was growing on the soap.

15:42.124 --> 15:43.716
I'm afraid there's
nothing I can do

15:43.759 --> 15:45.590
about the mold
in your hotel, Mr. Hill.

15:45.628 --> 15:47.323
They don't have
a policy with Lone Star,

15:47.363 --> 15:49.228
so there's no potential
liability on our end.

15:50.566 --> 15:53.057
They're arguing again, Hank.

15:53.102 --> 15:54.797
Or making love.

15:54.837 --> 15:55.895
You pig!

15:55.938 --> 15:57.269
Is that what you wanted?

15:57.306 --> 15:58.671
Making love.

16:04.747 --> 16:06.442
Uh, hey, yeah.

16:06.482 --> 16:07.540
You got a busted latch

16:07.583 --> 16:09.278
there, neighbors.

16:09.318 --> 16:12.446
Yeah, anyway,
my lady and I were wondering

16:12.488 --> 16:15.286
if you'd care to join us
for a Lynchburg lemonade.

16:15.324 --> 16:19.886
Uh, thank you, but we were just
about to sit down to dinner.

16:19.928 --> 16:22.260
Oh, well, cool, cool,
no biggie, okay.

16:22.297 --> 16:24.458
Y'all have a good one.

16:27.536 --> 16:30.664
There, I invited them!
You happy now!

16:30.706 --> 16:32.003
Okay.

16:32.041 --> 16:34.908
Who's ready for Peggy Hill's
coffee-maker ramen, huh?

16:48.057 --> 16:50.924
You'd think music that loud
would kill the bugs,

16:50.959 --> 16:52.187
but it doesn't.

16:52.227 --> 16:55.025
I tried sleeping
in the empty swimming pool,

16:55.064 --> 16:57.555
but, you know, the dogs.

16:58.834 --> 17:00.301
Can I just go home?

17:00.335 --> 17:03.498
I promise I'll put on
one of those space suits.

17:05.973 --> 17:07.669
Dang it, Bobby.

17:07.710 --> 17:10.770
If T. Anderson Kearney could
fight to give Texans a home,

17:10.813 --> 17:13.042
then I can fight
to get yours back.

17:13.082 --> 17:14.640
Rob Holguin is going to need

17:14.683 --> 17:16.617
to use this boot remover
on his ass

17:16.652 --> 17:18.142
when I'm done with him.

17:19.855 --> 17:22.186
Hello, I'd like to speak
to Mr. Holguin.

17:22.223 --> 17:23.521
Sorry, he's at lunch.

17:23.559 --> 17:24.992
Can I take a message?

17:25.027 --> 17:27.621
You don't have enough room on
that "While You Were Out" slip

17:27.663 --> 17:29.255
for what I have to say.

17:32.768 --> 17:35.532
All right, Holguin,
I'm through with your...

17:36.405 --> 17:37.895
Hey, hey, you're that

17:37.940 --> 17:39.771
mold tester guy, Mr. Goodman.

17:39.808 --> 17:42.333
Well, what... what are
you two doing together?

17:42.377 --> 17:44.106
Hey, guys. They just
put all the stuff out

17:44.146 --> 17:45.272
for make your own sundaes.

17:45.314 --> 17:46.975
My insurance adjuster?

17:47.015 --> 17:48.448
This is ridiculous.

17:48.484 --> 17:51.009
You're all in on this scam
together, aren't you?

17:51.053 --> 17:52.782
All you guys
care about is money.

17:52.821 --> 17:53.810
Okay, fine.

17:53.856 --> 17:56.222
How much to get rid of you?

17:57.593 --> 17:58.719
Is that a Cirrus machine?

18:00.162 --> 18:03.097
Yeah, but it'll only let you
take out $300 a day.

18:03.132 --> 18:05.464
That's just not going to cut it.

18:05.501 --> 18:06.559
Nope, not when you got

18:06.602 --> 18:08.365
a deal as sweet as ours.

18:08.403 --> 18:10.337
Heck, I could throw
a dart at the phone book

18:10.372 --> 18:13.034
and I bet you the house I hit
would test positive for mold.

18:13.075 --> 18:14.770
And the phone book, too.

18:14.810 --> 18:16.402
Say that other thing
you say, Rob.

18:16.445 --> 18:18.037
You know, the "Yee-hah."

18:18.080 --> 18:21.982
Oh, yeah..."Yee-hah! There's
gold in them there walls!"

18:27.689 --> 18:28.747
Excuse me, sir.

18:28.791 --> 18:30.418
I'm looking for no pest strips

18:30.459 --> 18:32.324
for both crawling
and flying pests.

18:32.361 --> 18:35.057
The motel I'm staying at
is a little dreary,

18:35.097 --> 18:37.292
so if you have the ones
that look, you know,

18:37.332 --> 18:39.323
a little festive,
that'd be good.

18:39.368 --> 18:40.596
Oh, hell, yeah.

18:40.636 --> 18:42.365
Dude, we got one's
with snowflakes,

18:42.404 --> 18:43.837
we got ones with
burros on them...

18:43.872 --> 18:45.499
I mean, they're all
pretty beautiful.

19:07.296 --> 19:09.059
I'm coming.

19:09.097 --> 19:10.587
Morning, Mr. Holguin.

19:10.632 --> 19:12.532
I was wondering if
we could have a word.

19:12.568 --> 19:14.160
Sure, come on in.

19:14.203 --> 19:16.398
Love to show you my
new flat screen TV.

19:16.438 --> 19:17.928
Just got it.

19:19.474 --> 19:21.271
So, Mr. Holguin, I thought
I'd come over here

19:21.310 --> 19:23.505
and ask you one more time,
politely,

19:23.545 --> 19:25.513
to please leave my house alone.

19:25.547 --> 19:28.710
Sorry, Mr. Hill, but I
just ordered a new couch.

19:28.750 --> 19:32.584
That big TV just makes
this one look so... dinky.

19:32.621 --> 19:34.111
Well, at least I tried.

19:34.156 --> 19:36.784
Hey, Bill, why don't you
make yourself comfortable.

19:36.825 --> 19:38.349
Thank you, Hank.

19:40.596 --> 19:42.427
Oh, I almost
for got to tell you.

19:42.464 --> 19:45.592
I just got myself certified
as a trained mold expert.

19:45.634 --> 19:47.192
Took me 30 minutes.

19:47.236 --> 19:48.567
Great.

19:48.604 --> 19:50.333
Maybe I'll see you
at our conference in Aspen.

19:50.372 --> 19:52.966
But, you know, the insurance
company will never let you

19:53.008 --> 19:54.566
test your own house and pass it.

19:54.610 --> 19:57.044
Now that would be a clear
conflict of interest.

19:57.079 --> 20:00.173
I know, that's why
I'm going to test your house.

20:02.384 --> 20:03.851
Bill, you ready?

20:03.886 --> 20:05.012
Ready.

20:07.556 --> 20:08.488
Ew!

20:08.523 --> 20:09.615
Yeah, pretty gross, huh?

20:09.658 --> 20:11.125
With the fungus and all.

20:11.159 --> 20:13.354
Hey, is fungus a mold?
Let's find out.

20:13.395 --> 20:14.362
Whoa, there.

20:14.396 --> 20:15.693
Now, now, now take it easy.

20:15.731 --> 20:17.596
Okay, let's just
talk about this.

20:17.633 --> 20:20.261
Hey, you're testing
right near his feet.

20:20.302 --> 20:21.735
Sorry, I'm new at this.

20:21.770 --> 20:24.739
But after I send the results
to your insurance company,

20:24.773 --> 20:26.673
I'm sure they'll
send someone out here

20:26.708 --> 20:28.642
and they'll do a more
thorough search.

20:28.677 --> 20:30.702
Punch a few holes
in your wall,

20:30.746 --> 20:32.304
rip up your floorboards.

20:32.347 --> 20:34.747
You know, I heard nine out
of ten houses have mold.

20:34.783 --> 20:37.274
But who knows, maybe you'll be one
of the lucky ones.

20:37.319 --> 20:39.378
Okay, okay.
What do you want?

20:45.527 --> 20:47.358
Okay, Mr. Hill, you passed.

20:47.396 --> 20:50.160
Your house is officially
mold-free. Good-bye.

20:50.198 --> 20:51.256
Now, hold on.

20:51.300 --> 20:52.597
We're not quite done yet.

20:52.634 --> 20:54.625
You two owe me a parade.

20:54.670 --> 20:56.570
So if you'll just step this way,

20:56.605 --> 20:57.936
and I know you will...

20:57.973 --> 20:59.099
Come on, Bobby.

20:59.141 --> 21:00.403
Let's show them

21:00.442 --> 21:02.467
the house that's going
to be yours someday.

21:03.812 --> 21:08.176
This ranch-style rambler was
built by the great grandson

21:08.216 --> 21:10.150
of T. Anderson Kearney.

21:10.185 --> 21:12.653
Uh, you might want
to put your case down.

21:12.688 --> 21:14.918
This is going to take a while.

21:14.957 --> 21:17.152
Now, the funny thing
about this boot remover...

21:17.192 --> 21:19.490
well, no so much funny
as educational...

21:19.528 --> 21:23.654
is that it was owned by the
man who fired the first shot

21:23.699 --> 21:25.633
at the Battle of Gonzalez.

21:28.170 --> 21:33.573
<b><font color="#0A7C32">Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

22:06.074 --> 22:08.668
<i>Yup</i>.
