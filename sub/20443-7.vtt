WEBVTT

00:12.806 --> 00:14.849
Pins for the bones.

00:16.726 --> 00:18.395
There's nothing
to believe.

00:18.561 --> 00:20.438
Threads for the muscles.

00:20.605 --> 00:22.524
When you die, you rot.

00:22.691 --> 00:24.693
Paint for the skin.

00:25.777 --> 00:27.696
It's just stories,
snake oil,

00:27.862 --> 00:30.031
but worse,
because snakes are real.

00:31.533 --> 00:33.952
Give me my fucking coin,
dead wife.

00:35.203 --> 00:36.746
Was it love?

00:36.913 --> 00:38.373
I suppose it is now.

00:38.540 --> 00:40.458
I'm gonna reach up
under those ribs

00:40.625 --> 00:43.837
and I'm gonna pluck that coin
out of you like a berry.

00:44.003 --> 00:46.423
Take us to Kentucky.
I'll tell you where to find your jinn.

00:46.589 --> 00:48.466
I'll tell you where to find
a whole murder of gods,

00:48.633 --> 00:50.969
demi and otherwise,
every goddamn one of 'em.

03:06.271 --> 03:08.064
Irish Red Ale.

03:09.274 --> 03:12.235
Brewed it just like
the Franciscan monks

03:12.402 --> 03:14.654
in Kilkenny in 1231.

03:14.821 --> 03:16.865
The well water was poison.

03:17.907 --> 03:20.702
This beer saved lives.

03:20.869 --> 03:22.912
It's past 6:00.

03:23.079 --> 03:25.373
I still have the cheek to do
and the lips.

03:25.540 --> 03:27.375
Well, he doesn't show
till the afternoon.

03:27.542 --> 03:28.835
We need the table.

03:29.002 --> 03:30.879
We got two more
coming in the morning.

03:31.045 --> 03:33.006
A woman
and a much younger woman.

03:33.172 --> 03:34.549
No call yet.

03:34.716 --> 03:36.384
They pass within the hour.

03:36.551 --> 03:38.052
Lover's quarrel?

03:38.219 --> 03:39.596
Overdose.

03:39.762 --> 03:42.640
We get so few lover's quarrels
these days.

03:42.807 --> 03:44.267
You want help?

03:44.434 --> 03:46.853
Uh-uh. You have a story to tell.

03:47.020 --> 03:48.855
Do I?

03:50.440 --> 03:52.650
I can see it in your fingers.

04:33.107 --> 04:35.026
<i>It is fine fiction</i>

04:35.193 --> 04:37.612
<i>that America
was founded by pilgrims</i>

04:37.779 --> 04:40.615
<i>seeking freedom
to believe as they wished,</i>

04:40.782 --> 04:42.283

04:42.450 --> 04:44.077
<i>spread and bred</i>

04:44.243 --> 04:45.787
<i>and filled the empty land.</i>

04:45.954 --> 04:47.372
<i>In truth,</i>

04:47.538 --> 04:50.291
<i>the American colonies were
as much a dumping ground</i>

04:50.458 --> 04:53.086
<i>as an escape,
a forgetting place.</i>

04:55.505 --> 04:58.007
Lover's quarrel. Shall I?

04:58.174 --> 05:00.176
I've got it. Go on.

05:03.137 --> 05:06.474
Ibis and Jacquel. Mm-hm.
Two females?

05:06.641 --> 05:08.559
<i>In the days when
you could be hanged in London</i>

05:08.726 --> 05:10.687
<i>for the theft of 12 pennies,</i>

05:10.853 --> 05:14.273
<i>the Americas became
a symbol of clemency.</i>

05:17.235 --> 05:19.612
<i>Transportation, it was called.</i>

05:22.490 --> 05:25.576
<i>For five years, for 10 years,
for life,</i>

05:25.743 --> 05:27.286
<i>you were sold to a captain</i>

05:27.453 --> 05:31.165
<i>and would ride his ship
crowded tight as a slaver's.</i>

05:32.500 --> 05:35.670
<i>Off the ship, you were sold
as an indentured servant</i>

05:35.837 --> 05:38.297
<i>to the one who would take
the cost of your skin out</i>

05:38.464 --> 05:39.841
<i>in your labour.</i>

05:40.008 --> 05:42.802
<i>But at least
you were not waiting to hang</i>

05:42.969 --> 05:44.721
<i>in an English prison.</i>

05:51.102 --> 05:54.022
<i>And when your years of indenture
were complete,</i>

05:54.188 --> 05:56.983
<i>you were free to make the best
of your new world.</i>

05:57.150 --> 05:59.777
<i>Of THE New World.</i>

06:12.790 --> 06:14.333
Essie Macgowan?

08:05.778 --> 08:08.531
that they have no time

08:08.698 --> 08:10.783
Why do we leave them a gift?

08:12.743 --> 08:16.497
Because we want their blessings,
so we better.

08:27.091 --> 08:29.886
<i>And when she was
no longer a young girl,</i>

08:30.052 --> 08:33.556
<i>curved and billowed like

08:48.029 --> 08:49.947
For it's favour
on one side of the coin

08:50.114 --> 08:51.657
and wrath on the other.

08:51.824 --> 08:54.744
Ballybogs, no doubt,
they can be reasoned with.

08:54.911 --> 08:59.332
Leprechauns, oh, they're
a different story altogether.

08:59.498 --> 09:01.459
Help you with your troubles
one day,

09:01.626 --> 09:03.711
then bite your eyes out
the next.

09:03.878 --> 09:05.254
It's true.

09:05.421 --> 09:09.258
One night, the kind that chills you
to your inner bones,

09:09.425 --> 09:11.093
I was walking to the lighthouse

09:11.260 --> 09:13.262
to bring me father
some pigeon stew and bread.

09:13.429 --> 09:15.056
And that's when I heard it.

09:15.223 --> 09:16.974
Boom!

09:17.141 --> 09:19.227
Boom! Like a hammer.

09:19.393 --> 09:22.021
"Who goes there?" I ask.

09:22.188 --> 09:23.773
No answer.

09:23.940 --> 09:26.025
I think about turning back,

09:26.192 --> 09:28.569
then my curiosity
gets the better of me.

09:28.736 --> 09:30.154
So I go towards it.

09:30.321 --> 09:33.741
Only the closer I get,
the farther away it goes.

09:33.908 --> 09:38.579
Finally, I turned around and
I'd wandered so far into the moors

09:38.746 --> 09:41.165
that I can't find me way back.

09:41.332 --> 09:45.962
Three hours, I wandered in the dark,
and not a thing familiar,

09:46.128 --> 09:48.130
but then I remembered

09:48.297 --> 09:50.800
what me gran told me
about the leprechaun.

09:50.967 --> 09:55.263
So, I swallow my hunger
and I take my bread,

09:55.429 --> 09:57.223
and I put it down on
a mossy stone

09:57.390 --> 09:59.141
and I lay down to sleep
beside it.

09:59.308 --> 10:01.936
And then you'll never
believe it.

10:02.103 --> 10:04.397
When I woke up,
the bread was gone.

10:04.563 --> 10:08.025
And there was the lighthouse,
the one I'd been looking for.

10:08.192 --> 10:09.819
It was only a spit away.

10:09.986 --> 10:13.406
So you see,
the faerie folk may be small,

10:13.572 --> 10:15.449
but don't let that fool ya.

10:15.616 --> 10:18.077

unminded.

<i>But Essie possessed
a rare token of ambition.</i>

11:01.329 --> 11:04.206
<i>She had paid close attention
to the tales.</i>

11:04.373 --> 11:06.959
<i>She knew
what the moment wanted.</i>

11:19.263 --> 11:22.516
<i>It was all the money
she had in the world.</i>

11:22.683 --> 11:24.810
<i>There were many silks
and lace she coveted,</i>

11:24.977 --> 11:28.439
<i>and she'd never once been full
of white bread or sillabub.</i>

11:28.606 --> 11:31.567
<i>But she knew one does not ask
favours of a leprechaun</i>

11:31.734 --> 11:34.278

19:24.748 --> 19:27.125
Hmm. I hadn't thought of it
that way.

19:27.292 --> 19:29.461
Yes, I suppose it's so.

19:29.628 --> 19:31.380

20:23.515 --> 20:26.310
- I think we should let Salim go.
- No, we should fucking not.

20:26.476 --> 20:28.020
We can make our own way

20:28.186 --> 20:30.397
From here is from nowhere.
I got business after your business.

20:30.564 --> 20:33.191
Pack up the rug! Back in the car.
We got ground to cover.

20:33.358 --> 20:34.985
We're near enough.
We don't need him anymore.

- I'm releasing him.

20:58.800 --> 21:00.802
You are released

21:00.969 --> 21:02.596
Fuck off. Go find your man.

21:02.763 --> 21:04.681
Your God, your Jinn.

21:08.810 --> 21:11.897
You...are
an unpleasant creature.

21:38.715 --> 21:41.259
Hello? Can I, uh, help you
with something, ma'am?

21:41.426 --> 21:44.888
Yes, I've always wanted to steal a car.
So I'm gonna steal yours.

21:45.055 --> 21:48.850
Uh, well, it's not mine,
it's my boss's.

21:49.017 --> 21:50.894
OK, well, then,
I'm stealing his.

21:51.061 --> 21:53.438
I don't know how much is here,
but you take that.

21:53.605 --> 21:55.941
You tell your boss you were robbed,
which you have been.

21:56.108 --> 21:58.902
My boss is never gonna
believe me if I look like this.

21:59.069 --> 22:00.988
No, you look fine.
You look great.

22:01.154 --> 22:03.073
No, he means without having
a bit of a tussle.

22:03.240 --> 22:05.409
- He wants me to punch him.
- Whoa, you could kill me.

22:05.575 --> 22:07.661
- Can she do it?
- Trust me.

22:07.828 --> 22:10.330
You don't want this one
hitting you.

22:49.995 --> 22:51.580
<i>Over the following years,</i>

22:51.747 --> 22:54.124

23:11.683 --> 23:13.727

23:13.894 --> 23:17.522
<i>she lived by her own labours

23:20.734 --> 23:22.778
<i>She saved her thanks

23:22.944 --> 23:24.780

23:24.946 --> 23:26.823

25:35.035 --> 25:36.953
Don't eat

25:37.120 --> 25:39.122
unless you like
shitting yourself dry.

25:39.289 --> 25:40.790
Stick to the bread.

25:43.043 --> 25:45.337
Pretty girl like you
don't belong here.

25:46.880 --> 25:48.757
How do you know
what I look like?

25:48.924 --> 25:52.177
I can hear a voice hadn't had
its fill of screaming.

25:53.595 --> 25:56.598
Well, I most definitely
do not belong here.

25:57.933 --> 26:00.393
I was just at the pub
for a cup of ale.

26:00.560 --> 26:02.062
Good lad.

26:02.229 --> 26:04.064
I was even gonna pay for it

26:04.231 --> 26:06.358
when some flange
cuts in front of me

26:06.524 --> 26:08.401
like fucking
King fucking George.

26:08.568 --> 26:11.321
So I give him a good chock,
just a warning.

26:11.488 --> 26:13.907
And he topples head first
into a broken bottle.

26:14.074 --> 26:16.117
Lost the eye, they tell me.

26:16.284 --> 26:19.079
Plenty of flanges do well
with just one.

26:20.205 --> 26:22.582
And what of you, miss?
You take an eye?

26:22.749 --> 26:26.211
- Lace.
- Not too dear.

26:26.378 --> 26:28.213
Reason to hope
on transportation, then.

26:28.380 --> 26:31.258
I'm past that hope.
I had my opportunity.

26:31.424 --> 26:36.263
Doesn't seem right,
just giving you the one.

26:36.429 --> 26:39.140
Well, the world
don't operate on right.

26:39.307 --> 26:41.142
That it doesn't.

26:41.309 --> 26:43.603
To hell with them
and their gallows.

26:43.770 --> 26:46.189
Give them a good, long piss
as you dangle.

26:46.356 --> 26:48.525
Make a mess for them
to mop after.

26:48.692 --> 26:50.735
So long as you don't go easy.

26:51.945 --> 26:55.156
So, you sailed
the boat prior, then?

26:55.323 --> 26:56.783
Made it far as Carolina.

26:56.950 --> 26:59.369
Musha! The Americas!

26:59.536 --> 27:01.204
How was it?

27:01.371 --> 27:03.415
I don't know,
I didn't stay long enough

27:03.581 --> 27:05.500
to see much
before heading back to London.

27:05.667 --> 27:07.544
I didn't give it a chance.

27:07.711 --> 27:10.130
Shame.
I hear there's chances there.

27:10.297 --> 27:12.173
You could try a bribe.

27:12.340 --> 27:14.551
Warden would free his own heart
from his chest

27:14.718 --> 27:16.094
for a bit of gold.

27:16.261 --> 27:18.054
Just ran out.

27:18.221 --> 27:20.181
Would I could give you
some of mine.

27:20.348 --> 27:22.142
You've got gold?

27:22.309 --> 27:24.811
Had. Quite a bit.

27:24.978 --> 27:26.646
Held it in keeping.

27:27.689 --> 27:29.065
Drank my share

27:29.232 --> 27:31.609
but delivered the balance on time
where it was meant.

27:31.776 --> 27:33.236
To who?

27:33.403 --> 27:34.821
The King.

27:36.781 --> 27:40.785
We're in prison, love.
All we have to do is tell tales.

27:40.952 --> 27:43.621
You've told your share, I wager.

27:46.624 --> 27:48.960
I met an Indian woman there.

27:49.127 --> 27:51.338
In the Americas.

27:52.672 --> 27:54.382
She had an apple cart.

27:54.549 --> 27:56.593
Sold pound cakes in the morning.

27:56.760 --> 27:58.720
Skin like a brick.

27:58.887 --> 28:03.016
I asked her name
and she said, "Susan."

28:03.183 --> 28:05.101
A woman like her called "Susan"?

28:05.268 --> 28:07.437
I said, "What name
were you born to?"

28:07.604 --> 28:10.732
And she just said,
"I'm Susan now."

28:12.400 --> 28:15.528
In the Americas, anyone can be
anything they insist upon.

28:15.695 --> 28:21.743
New name, new life.
That's a place a body could be happy.

28:21.910 --> 28:24.079
What the fuck is happy?

28:24.245 --> 28:26.206
Fucked if I know.

28:28.375 --> 28:30.752
I think I knew
when I was a little girl.

28:31.795 --> 28:33.713
Sitting on the shingle
waiting for me father's boat

28:33.880 --> 28:35.256
to return from sea.

28:35.423 --> 28:38.259
Now I'd be content
to be content.

28:39.636 --> 28:43.181
A home, a tree.

28:44.599 --> 28:46.810
Someone kind enough to be by me.

28:48.061 --> 28:49.729
Not too kind.

28:49.896 --> 28:52.107
I've been living on my boots

28:52.273 --> 28:54.818
and out of my pockets
long since I can remember.

28:56.277 --> 28:57.904
You could get lucky.

28:58.071 --> 28:59.489
Do alright there.

28:59.656 --> 29:01.366
The fuck would I do
in the Americas?

29:01.533 --> 29:03.284
Deliver gold to their king.

29:04.452 --> 29:06.246
They don't have a king.

29:06.413 --> 29:07.914
Not yet.

29:09.040 --> 29:10.708
Everyone needs a king.

29:47.704 --> 29:50.331

34:26.232 --> 34:27.859
Then Mother Church came along

34:28.025 --> 34:31.362
and turned us all into saints,
and trolls and faeries.

34:31.529 --> 34:33.489
General Mills did the rest.

34:33.656 --> 34:35.032
So what's the appeal?

34:35.199 --> 34:36.617
What's Wednesday selling

34:36.784 --> 34:38.786
at this god-fest
that you've got to get a ticket?

34:40.830 --> 34:42.331
War.

34:47.211 --> 34:49.088
I went to war once.

34:50.131 --> 34:51.716
Or was meant to.

34:52.842 --> 34:54.594
Long time back.

34:55.762 --> 34:59.015
On the eve of battle,
I looked into the fire...

35:01.100 --> 35:04.312
..and I saw my death,
sure as Sunday.

35:04.479 --> 35:06.397
I saw.

35:22.580 --> 35:26.083
I knew I would die that day
if I stayed.

35:31.339 --> 35:33.216
I put on my boots...

35:34.342 --> 35:38.346
..and dropped my sword,
and I flew.

35:44.560 --> 35:46.145
I owe a battle.

35:49.315 --> 35:50.691
You're following Wednesday

35:50.858 --> 35:52.735
so that you can fight in his war
and die?

35:52.902 --> 35:55.321
And for that,
you run his errands?

35:57.323 --> 35:59.325
I've done worse than that.

36:01.536 --> 36:03.037
Dying worked for me.

36:03.204 --> 36:05.456
Everyone should try it
at least once.

36:05.623 --> 36:07.792
Seems like you've walked the earth
a couple hundred years

36:07.959 --> 36:10.628
in those boots already,
so you're due.

37:25.036 --> 37:26.746
The night of Samhain,

37:26.913 --> 37:29.832
the spirits can spill freely
into our world,

37:29.999 --> 37:33.794
but if you wear a disguise,
like that,

37:33.961 --> 37:36.464
then they'll take you
for one of their own.

37:36.631 --> 37:38.674
- The horsie's coming!
- Yes, your daddy's home.

37:38.841 --> 37:41.802
But we have to pay
special mind of who?

37:41.969 --> 37:43.387
The lep...

37:43.554 --> 37:44.889
..prechaun.

37:45.056 --> 37:46.849
Leprechaun! That's right.

37:47.016 --> 37:50.603
So we just leave a small ration
from our harvest.

37:50.770 --> 37:53.689
'Cause if they so choose,
they can lead you off the path

37:53.856 --> 37:55.650
you've trod
a thousand times before.

37:58.527 --> 38:00.404

all these things</i>

38:00.571 --> 38:05.076

38:19.382 --> 38:22.551
Sorry. I just finished up, sir.

38:25.930 --> 38:28.683
Well, goodnight,
Master Richardson.

38:28.849 --> 38:31.018
Wait.

38:36.691 --> 38:38.567
Master Richardson.

38:41.278 --> 38:44.699
I never realised...
that you took me for...

38:44.865 --> 38:47.493

transportee girl,</i>

39:00.214 --> 39:02.133
