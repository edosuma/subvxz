00:02.217 --> 00:04.733
- Hey. Morning.
- Can you grab the milk?

00:05.577 --> 00:06.820
[yelps]

00:07.671 --> 00:09.483
Oh, my God.
Is it another rat?

00:09.662 --> 00:11.054
No.

00:11.487 --> 00:13.241
It's food.

00:14.671 --> 00:17.171
Close it and open it again.
I don't believe it's real.

00:17.523 --> 00:18.614
Who did this?

00:18.702 --> 00:21.208
Not me; I've got
four dollars in my wallet

00:21.296 --> 00:22.578
and it's got to last me
till next week.

00:22.665 --> 00:23.993
Well, it wasn't me either
and, by the way,

00:24.081 --> 00:25.650
you have two dollars
in your wallet.

00:26.319 --> 00:28.451
Look, look.
There's strawberry jam.

00:28.639 --> 00:29.788
With seeds.

00:29.876 --> 00:32.241
So you know it came from
real strawberries.

00:32.475 --> 00:33.733
- Morning.
- Adam,

00:33.821 --> 00:35.061
there's food in the house.

00:35.197 --> 00:36.720
[chuckles]:
I know, I bought it.

00:36.811 --> 00:38.733
I'm tired of coming home
at 2:00 a.m. after work

00:38.821 --> 00:41.874
and finding a box of baking soda
and a fuzzy lemon.

00:42.249 --> 00:44.207
Okay, this jam is mine,
I called it.

00:44.342 --> 00:45.663
You know,
I went crazy and bought

00:45.758 --> 00:46.811
some bread
to put that on.

00:46.898 --> 00:48.217
Bread? I want bread.

00:48.305 --> 00:49.631
I call that, too.

00:49.771 --> 00:51.358
Adam, how much did you spend?

00:51.446 --> 00:52.665
Don't worry about it.

00:52.827 --> 00:54.489
We're doing really well
at the bar

00:54.577 --> 00:55.772
and we deserve
nice things.

00:55.860 --> 00:57.311
Nice things I get,

00:57.437 --> 01:00.014
but what's with
the fancy-ass beans?

01:00.418 --> 01:02.006
They're not
the grocery store brand?

01:02.094 --> 01:03.569
Nope. Check out the lid.

01:03.711 --> 01:05.624
[gasps]
A pop-top!

01:06.449 --> 01:09.230
Okay, Bill Gates,
now you're just showboating.

How's the fruit
looking today?

01:34.841 --> 01:36.626
Must we do this dance?

01:37.651 --> 01:40.107
You're right.
Cheeseburger and fries.

01:40.834 --> 01:42.615
You? I'll just have
a side of mayo.

01:42.906 --> 01:45.490
I'm not even
in the mood to ask.

01:46.119 --> 01:47.630
Is there a
new mayo diet?

01:47.718 --> 01:48.600
Is it hard?
Is it working?

01:48.688 --> 01:50.147
'Cause you look good.

01:50.770 --> 01:52.389
I'm on the eat all the food
in the fridge

01:52.477 --> 01:54.093
before it spoils diet.

01:54.181 --> 01:56.554
She had a turkey leg
and a box of cherry tomatoes

01:56.617 --> 01:57.686
- for breakfast.
- Yeah.

01:57.774 --> 01:58.836
You could have
helped out, too,

01:58.924 --> 02:01.400
Miss "yogurt that still had
a week to go."

02:01.885 --> 02:04.654
I usually like their fights,
but I don't get this one.

02:05.333 --> 02:07.319
Adam's bar is finally
bringing in

02:07.407 --> 02:09.225
a little money
and he had the audacity

02:09.312 --> 02:10.705
to fill our fridge
with food.

02:10.806 --> 02:13.112
And I'll be damned
if I'm letting any of it go bad.

02:13.246 --> 02:15.205
Here, banana-tizers
all around.

02:15.332 --> 02:17.538
That's great
that his bar's doing well.

02:17.626 --> 02:19.106
[panicked shushing]

02:19.194 --> 02:21.444
Jinxsy!
Don't say it out loud.

02:27.654 --> 02:28.882
Um...

02:28.970 --> 02:31.366
you just salted
that guy's baby.

02:33.288 --> 02:34.965
Why aren't you happy
the bar's doing well?

02:35.100 --> 02:37.397
[exclaims]
What did Bonnie just say?

02:39.445 --> 02:41.969
He smiled. [chuckles]

02:42.367 --> 02:45.303
Oh, stupid baby
thinks it's snowing.

02:49.561 --> 02:50.913
Look, I'm glad
it's happening,

02:51.001 --> 02:53.264
I just don't want Adam
going crazy with it.

02:53.352 --> 02:55.522
He bought food.
And running shoes.

02:55.663 --> 02:57.358
Running shoes.

02:57.678 --> 03:00.246
- [phone chimes]
- Aw.

03:00.507 --> 03:01.621
ALL: Yuri.

03:01.709 --> 03:02.740
But it's even better.

03:02.828 --> 03:03.990
It's him holding a cat.

03:04.078 --> 03:05.639
- Ooh, let me see.
- [gasps]

03:05.727 --> 03:07.555
- [chuckles]
- [meows]

03:08.357 --> 03:09.952
[meowing]

03:10.959 --> 03:12.529
Take the phone back.

03:12.848 --> 03:15.021
It's his cousin's cat,
they're roommates.

03:15.109 --> 03:16.589
[gasps] Which reminds me,
Christy.

03:16.677 --> 03:18.777
Sergei just broke up
with his girlfriend and I...

03:18.880 --> 03:20.582
- I'm in.
- Maybe I'd fix you guys up,

03:20.670 --> 03:21.474
I mean...
I said I'm in...-

03:21.562 --> 03:23.318
he's pretty cute
and I think you guys...

03:23.406 --> 03:24.710
Did you not just hear her?
She's about to jump up

03:24.797 --> 03:26.246
on this table and
start twerking.

03:26.357 --> 03:27.381
I really am.

03:27.491 --> 03:28.886
Okay, great, well,
how about we go

03:28.974 --> 03:30.068
to their place
for dinner Friday?

03:30.156 --> 03:31.654
No, no, not Friday.
We've got four pounds

03:31.741 --> 03:33.873
of pork shoulder
that's best before the 17th.

03:34.833 --> 03:37.587
I haven't touched a man
in ten months.

03:37.896 --> 03:41.037
I'm willing to take
my chances with old pork.

03:46.469 --> 03:49.375
Picking up your entire life
and moving to a strange country?

03:49.463 --> 03:51.204
- I can't imagine.
- Hmm.

03:51.292 --> 03:53.468
- You must get homesick.
- Sometimes.

03:53.601 --> 03:55.353
But then I shove ice cube
down his pants

03:55.449 --> 03:57.870
and say,
"Snap out of it!" [laughs]

03:57.958 --> 04:00.259
It's funny every time.
[laughs]

04:00.478 --> 04:01.358
[chuckling]

04:01.446 --> 04:03.347
How did you learn
to speak such good English?

04:03.435 --> 04:07.167
Ah. Watching
Law and Order: SVU.

04:07.720 --> 04:09.464
"In the criminal
justice system,

04:09.552 --> 04:11.105

No pressure... whatever
happens, happens.

04:17.224 --> 04:18.628
But it's happening.

04:19.379 --> 04:21.644
Who's ready for
Duncan Hines Bundt cake?

04:21.732 --> 04:22.907
TAMMY:
Ooh.

04:23.008 --> 04:24.331
They raise their
hands here.

04:24.419 --> 04:25.725
Oh.

04:25.918 --> 04:28.050
Go relax on couch,
we'll clean up.

04:28.247 --> 04:29.964
[Christy chuckles]

04:31.939 --> 04:34.551
- So what do you think?
- He's amazing.

04:34.669 --> 04:36.019
- [chuckles]
- They're both amazing.

04:36.106 --> 04:37.589
They cook,
they clean.

04:37.677 --> 04:39.972
And they're gentle,
sensitive lovers.

04:40.112 --> 04:41.159
Well, mine is.

04:41.247 --> 04:44.394
And Sergei plays the guitar,
so I can only assume...

04:44.481 --> 04:47.527
I could have a Russian boyfriend
who plays guitar? [chuckles]

04:47.644 --> 04:48.425
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

04:48.513 --> 04:50.261
I always do this,
I get ahead of myself.

04:50.349 --> 04:51.653
Yeah, you're right.
It's just the first date.

04:51.740 --> 04:52.519
Be cool.

04:52.607 --> 04:54.376
But we are totally
having a double wedding.

04:54.464 --> 04:55.824
Right?
[laughs]

04:55.912 --> 04:56.956
Dessert is served.

04:57.091 --> 04:59.703
Sergei, he make
this cake himself.

04:59.927 --> 05:03.388
It's moist because
it has pudding inside.

05:04.278 --> 05:06.534
It's sweet that you guys
are so close.

05:06.622 --> 05:08.456
We are like
Three Musketeers.

05:08.544 --> 05:10.177
But only two.

05:10.496 --> 05:12.660
Don't make me emotional
in front of women.

05:12.950 --> 05:13.978
[knocking at door]

05:14.160 --> 05:16.307
Please enjoy your moist cake,
I will get this.

05:19.200 --> 05:20.550
Yuri, your cousin is so nice.

05:20.637 --> 05:21.932
Ah, he has good heart.

Is everything okay out there?

05:32.997 --> 05:34.259
It's just business.

We are entertaining.

05:43.964 --> 05:47.104
I... Forgive me, ladies.

05:47.192 --> 05:49.135
Five minutes
and then Pictionary.

Christy, how's your cake?

05:53.489 --> 05:54.497
Stolen.

05:54.746 --> 05:57.465
I mean, moist. I mean, good.

05:59.582 --> 06:01.270
Who's uncomfortable?

06:08.554 --> 06:10.481
Is that a new hat?

06:11.129 --> 06:13.114
I guess, maybe.
I don't know.

06:13.340 --> 06:16.082
Well, you either went to a store
and bought a hat or you didn't.

06:16.442 --> 06:18.590
F-Fine, I bought a hat.[scoffs]

06:18.801 --> 06:20.205
You might want
to be nicer to me,

06:20.293 --> 06:21.760
I'm taking you out
for a surprise.

06:21.848 --> 06:23.001
I hate surprises.

06:23.089 --> 06:24.739
What kind of person
hates surprises?

06:24.827 --> 06:25.947
The kind who was
in the bath

06:26.035 --> 06:28.114
when the DEA
broke down the door.

06:28.705 --> 06:30.538
The first time.
The second time?

06:30.626 --> 06:32.621
[scoffs] I was ready for them.

06:33.176 --> 06:34.791
Well, this is a good surprise.

06:34.879 --> 06:36.596
Are we shopping
for expensive hats?

06:36.684 --> 06:39.285
Oh, my God.
I got it at the car wash.

06:39.378 --> 06:41.847
Oh, so now we're going
to fancy car washes.

06:42.246 --> 06:44.106
Yeah, I was in line
behind the queen.

06:45.035 --> 06:46.588
Uh, B-Bonnie.
Bonnie, you got

06:46.676 --> 06:48.457
to get over this.
I'm making money.

06:48.707 --> 06:50.518
You're right, I'm sorry.

06:50.606 --> 06:51.721
And I'll try.

06:51.809 --> 06:53.371
Good, 'cause we're here.

06:53.942 --> 06:55.035
What? No.

06:55.122 --> 06:56.293
No, no.

06:56.381 --> 06:58.252
I don't want a new car.

06:58.400 --> 06:59.940
I don't need a new car.

07:00.028 --> 07:02.504
My car is fine.[stammers]

07:02.808 --> 07:04.339

doesn't close,

07:04.427 --> 07:05.848
you have a hole in the
floor and when you park it

07:05.936 --> 07:07.817
out front of the bar,
it scares customers away.

07:07.936 --> 07:10.612
Is the bar doing well
or are customers scared away?

07:10.700 --> 07:12.145
'Cause it can't be both.

07:12.379 --> 07:15.127
There she is, my favorite
ex-mother-in-law.

07:15.222 --> 07:17.223
Oh, God. This yahoo?

07:18.110 --> 07:19.598
Hey, Baxter.

07:20.200 --> 07:21.268
Was she surprised?

07:21.356 --> 07:22.829
Yeah, it made her super mad.

07:22.917 --> 07:25.744
You know, everything you want
a present to do.

07:27.247 --> 07:29.582
I'm not angry.
I just don't need a new car.

07:29.669 --> 07:30.993
Will you at least
let him show you

07:31.081 --> 07:31.944
the one that we picked out?

07:32.032 --> 07:33.079
[groans] Fine.

07:33.167 --> 07:36.121
[claps hands]
Change is uncomfortable.

07:36.209 --> 07:37.884
But you know
what is not uncomfortable?

07:37.972 --> 07:39.552
Heated leather seats.

07:39.640 --> 07:42.155
My ass is hot
enough on its own.

07:43.982 --> 07:45.388
Slide on in there, Bonnie.

07:45.476 --> 07:46.770
Got the yacht rock all fired up.

07:46.858 --> 07:49.654
Christopher Cross and you
are ready to ride like the wind.

07:49.742 --> 07:51.251
Just don't get caught
between

07:51.339 --> 07:53.636
the moon and New York City.
[chuckles]

07:54.430 --> 07:56.069
Stay in your lane, Wheels.
I got this.

07:57.358 --> 07:59.665
I don't know how many times
I got to tell you guys I...

07:59.752 --> 08:00.971
Oh.

08:01.058 --> 08:04.148
Lumbar support.
Shuts the yapper every time.

08:04.235 --> 08:06.193
Hey. I see a little smile.

08:06.280 --> 08:07.978
Someone's starting to like it.

08:08.065 --> 08:09.806
Okay, okay, how much?

08:09.893 --> 08:11.982
Don't worry about that,
we can afford it.

08:12.069 --> 08:14.201
How much?

08:14.288 --> 08:16.682
I worked out the
sweetest deal ever.

08:16.769 --> 08:18.945
Zero down,
$350 a month.

08:19.032 --> 08:20.599
How many months? Does that...

08:20.686 --> 08:21.992
How many months? 72.

08:22.079 --> 08:25.952
72 months? Who knows
if we'll still be together!

08:26.039 --> 08:27.432
Wh-What?
We're getting married.

08:27.519 --> 08:30.653
Yeah, you can get out of that.
This, you're locked in.

08:30.740 --> 08:33.960
Let me out.

08:34.047 --> 08:35.352
Get me out of here.

08:35.440 --> 08:37.746
There's a button. Well,
there's a million buttons!

08:37.833 --> 08:41.097
["Ride Like The Wind"
by Christopher Cross playing]

08:41.184 --> 08:43.187
Will you...
Bonnie, stop.

08:43.274 --> 08:46.799
Screw it. I'm going C-section.

08:46.886 --> 08:50.847
Be careful on the roof,
these things are not well made.

08:50.934 --> 08:52.718
I will see you at home,

08:52.805 --> 08:55.286
and don't be late
'cause I'm making that ham.

08:58.835 --> 09:01.102
- Want to get high?
- Absolutely.

09:03.900 --> 09:05.002
Hey, Taylor.

09:05.090 --> 09:06.423
How's your day?
How's it going?

09:06.511 --> 09:09.158
What, your friends aren't here
so now you want to talk?

09:09.824 --> 09:11.582
Oh, come on,
I'm not like that.

09:11.670 --> 09:12.670
Hmm.

09:12.844 --> 09:14.535
Don't you have a son
in college?

09:14.662 --> 09:16.194
I'm 30.

09:17.917 --> 09:19.377
Well, this has been fun.

09:19.465 --> 09:21.182
Hey, Tammy!

09:21.420 --> 09:23.611
Sorry I'm late,
I was at Yuri's.

09:23.699 --> 09:25.187
We had the place
to ourselves,

09:25.275 --> 09:26.677
- Please stop.
- And we... Oh, I need

09:26.765 --> 09:28.815
to say it out loud.
We made love.

09:29.866 --> 09:30.944
Good for you.

09:31.032 --> 09:33.568
Oh, that reminds me,
this is from Sergei.

09:37.977 --> 09:39.327
An Apple Watch?

09:39.415 --> 09:42.720
To quote Sergei,
he's "smeetten" with you.

09:43.744 --> 09:45.635
Tammy, I can't keep this.

09:45.723 --> 09:46.827
Why?

09:46.915 --> 09:49.521
Despite the fact
that it looks cool and...

09:49.609 --> 09:52.071
Oh, my God,
it's taking my pulse...

09:53.564 --> 09:54.939
I'm pretty sure it's stolen.

09:55.027 --> 09:57.220
What?
No, he knows a guy.

09:58.069 --> 10:01.049
Tammy, we both know what
it means when you know a guy.

10:01.137 --> 10:02.266
[scoffs]And come on,

10:02.369 --> 10:04.181
that business in the apartment
with the TVs...

10:04.268 --> 10:05.976
Okay, so no man's perfect,

10:06.064 --> 10:08.478
but I really think you should
give Sergei another chance.

10:08.597 --> 10:11.599
I'm not talking about me.
You're on parole

10:11.687 --> 10:14.515
and Sergei's obviously involved
in illegal activity.

10:14.658 --> 10:17.067
You're taking a huge risk every
time you're in that apartment.

10:17.154 --> 10:18.773
Well, I can't take Yuri
to Marjorie's,

10:18.861 --> 10:20.990
it's the least sexy place
on the planet.

10:21.078 --> 10:22.286
[imitating Marjorie]:
"Oh, are you two gonna get

10:22.373 --> 10:24.035
hot and bothered?"

10:25.424 --> 10:28.093
This is serious.
You could go back to prison.

10:28.181 --> 10:30.031
Look, I'm not stupid, okay?

10:30.119 --> 10:32.861
I know Sergei's a little shady,
but Yuri's clean.

10:32.949 --> 10:34.925
Even if he is, the fact
that he lives with him...

10:35.012 --> 10:36.696
Stop.
I got this.

10:36.865 --> 10:39.449
I have an amazing
guy and I'm not screwing it up.

10:40.366 --> 10:42.561
- I think I'm just gonna go.
- Tammy...

10:42.649 --> 10:44.301
No, you know what,
I could eat.

10:45.436 --> 10:47.899
I just made love
for three hours.

10:57.061 --> 10:58.410
Can you believe
that guy?

10:58.498 --> 11:01.575
Men, always trying
to buy us cars.

11:02.634 --> 11:03.880
You think this is a joke?

11:03.968 --> 11:06.173
I don't know.
For as long as I can remember,

11:06.261 --> 11:08.907
you've always said, "If I ever
have money, I want a new car."

11:08.995 --> 11:11.536
I just think this spending
is tempting the fates.

11:11.624 --> 11:13.521
You know, putting
a big target on us,

11:13.608 --> 11:16.112
like, "Hey, Universe,
look over here. We got money."

11:16.200 --> 11:19.005
Next thing you know, your
pet monkey rips your face off.

11:19.728 --> 11:21.420
At least you'd have money
for a new face.

11:21.508 --> 11:24.629
No, I wouldn't because Adam
spent it all on hats.

11:25.256 --> 11:26.274
Hey.

11:26.362 --> 11:27.418
Hello.

11:27.506 --> 11:28.712
- Is that the hat?
- Uh-huh.

11:28.800 --> 11:30.350
Good Lord.

11:31.796 --> 11:32.844
I don't want to fight.

11:32.931 --> 11:34.020
I don't either.

11:34.107 --> 11:36.015
Well, good.
I'm just confused.

11:36.103 --> 11:38.214
What is the point
of me busting my ass,

11:38.302 --> 11:39.645
smelling like wings and beer,

11:39.733 --> 11:41.114
barely spending
any time with you,

11:41.201 --> 11:44.238
if I can't at least treat
my family to a few nice things.

11:44.340 --> 11:46.857
Aw, he called me family.

11:47.208 --> 11:48.798
You're so easy.

11:49.758 --> 11:51.444
It's just I've always
wanted to have money

11:51.532 --> 11:54.152
and now that we do,
I'm afraid we're gonna lose it.

11:54.240 --> 11:55.836
Oh, you worrying
about us going broke

11:55.924 --> 11:58.109
makes me feel like you don't
have much confidence in me.

11:58.196 --> 11:59.915
Well, I'm sorry,
I don't mean that.

12:00.002 --> 12:02.396
Then can you maybe
try to trust me?

12:02.559 --> 12:05.498
Yeah, Mom,
for the family.

12:11.144 --> 12:13.320
All right,
I will trust you.

12:13.407 --> 12:15.104
Good, because
I bought you the car.

12:15.191 --> 12:17.477
What?
How could you do that?

12:17.565 --> 12:19.631
What? Because I know
you're gonna love it.

12:19.719 --> 12:22.155
Ow!

12:22.242 --> 12:25.050
Unbelievable.
You're so selfish.

12:25.145 --> 12:27.421
- That really dinged me.
- Selfish?

12:27.583 --> 12:28.857
Left a dent.

12:28.981 --> 12:30.946
You know what?
I'm gonna take it back.

12:31.033 --> 12:32.426
You do
what you want.

12:32.590 --> 12:34.035
Am I bleeding?

12:34.273 --> 12:35.536
Where'd you park it?

12:35.624 --> 12:37.779
It's the only car out front
with a bow on it!

12:39.797 --> 12:41.799
I'm a little dizzy.

12:44.699 --> 12:46.255
Mama?

12:47.971 --> 12:50.569
So he-he just threw
the keys at you?

12:51.157 --> 12:54.280
I don't really remember.
I kind of blacked out.

12:55.630 --> 12:56.754
Anyway...

12:57.155 --> 12:59.491
sorry for coming by
unannounced.

12:59.579 --> 13:02.499
Oh, it's okay. Lots of people
come here unannounced.

13:02.691 --> 13:04.965
At least it's not 2:00
in the morning.

13:05.807 --> 13:09.009
Yeah, that's kind of what
I wanted to talk to you about.

13:09.637 --> 13:11.591
You know Tammy's
on parole, right?

13:11.781 --> 13:14.038
Yes, I love her
anyway.

13:14.207 --> 13:17.601
She could get into a lot of
trouble for dating a guy

13:17.688 --> 13:19.322
who's living with
a sweet, handsome,

13:19.410 --> 13:22.579
but obviously
criminal cousin.

13:23.706 --> 13:25.663
Which reminds me,

13:26.773 --> 13:28.845
please give this
back to Sergei.

13:28.981 --> 13:30.744
Oh, Sergei's
not criminal,

13:30.832 --> 13:33.516
he is what we call
"middleman."

13:34.316 --> 13:37.241
Dimitri and Misha,
now those guys are criminals.

13:38.902 --> 13:41.873
Look, you don't want Tammy
to go back to prison, right?

13:41.961 --> 13:43.113
Of course not.

13:43.296 --> 13:46.326
But you live with somebody
she can't be around.

13:46.997 --> 13:51.157
Oh, so as long as I'm living
with Sergei, she's at risk?

13:51.245 --> 13:52.604
Yes.

13:54.682 --> 13:55.900
I get it.

13:57.418 --> 13:58.903
Thank you, Yuri.

14:00.095 --> 14:01.993
No, thank you,
Christy.

14:05.519 --> 14:07.695
Shall I tell Sergei
that you came by?

14:11.986 --> 14:14.277
I'm not on parole,
why the hell not?

14:17.051 --> 14:18.332
Hey there,
can I tell you about our...

14:18.419 --> 14:20.006
- No.
- You look like

14:20.094 --> 14:21.135
- you're in the market...
- No.

14:21.222 --> 14:23.806
- There's my favorite...
- No. Office, now.

14:24.082 --> 14:25.988
- Want a jelly doughnut?
- No!

14:26.513 --> 14:28.203
Well, I do.

14:30.717 --> 14:32.675
What's wrong?
Having trouble with the Sirius XM?

14:32.763 --> 14:34.400
A lot of our
older custom...

14:35.592 --> 14:37.333
A lot of our
customers do.

14:37.420 --> 14:39.227
I'm returning the car.

14:39.521 --> 14:41.250
- Bonnie, sit down.
- No.

14:41.337 --> 14:43.858
Okay, well, I'm sitting.
I'm on my feet all day.

14:43.961 --> 14:45.080
Hey, if I showed
you a thing,

14:45.167 --> 14:47.235
could you tell me
if it's a corn?

14:47.648 --> 14:49.556
I want you to tear up
the contract.

14:49.644 --> 14:53.512
Look, I have a pretty good idea
of what you're going through.

14:53.687 --> 14:55.525
You got jelly on your shirt.

14:55.673 --> 14:57.374
Aw, damn it.

14:58.463 --> 15:01.902
Dance with a jelly doughnut,
sometimes you pay the piper.

15:02.340 --> 15:05.349
Look, when I met Candace,

15:05.611 --> 15:07.391
I was living in my van.

15:07.479 --> 15:10.816
Now I have a five bedroom house,
membership at a golf club,

15:10.932 --> 15:13.675
collection of vintage
arcade games. [chuckles]

15:13.763 --> 15:16.479
Frogger, so underrated.

15:19.181 --> 15:20.969
Son of a...

15:22.312 --> 15:23.853
Is this going somewhere?

15:23.941 --> 15:26.506
What I'm trying to say is
it took me a while to get used

15:26.594 --> 15:30.359
to having nice things,
but it turns out, it's great.

15:30.598 --> 15:33.021
But aren't you afraid
it's all gonna go away?

15:34.372 --> 15:37.963
Even if it does, at least
I enjoyed it while it lasted.

15:38.674 --> 15:41.633
Huh.
That actually makes sense.

15:41.919 --> 15:45.351
Really? 'Cause when I was
saying it, it sounded weird.

15:45.996 --> 15:48.307
I don't know, maybe I am
getting in my own way.

15:48.395 --> 15:50.421
I've always been a "live in
the moment" kind of gal,

15:50.508 --> 15:51.724
and now I'm obsessing
about something

15:51.811 --> 15:53.161
that hasn't even happened.

15:54.058 --> 15:56.157
Thoughts are not reality.

15:56.870 --> 16:00.146
Wow, listen to me,
and I'm not even high.

16:00.684 --> 16:01.751
Baxter.

16:01.878 --> 16:04.189
Fine, tail end of a good buzz.

16:04.867 --> 16:06.782
Enjoy this
while you can.

16:07.661 --> 16:09.577
Aren't you afraid
it's gonna make you soft?

16:09.792 --> 16:11.357
Oh, I'm soft,

16:12.412 --> 16:13.487
but Candace is loaded.

16:13.575 --> 16:15.375
As long as I'm with her,
I'm fine.

16:15.463 --> 16:18.196
And you sure you two are solid,
jelly boy?

16:18.284 --> 16:19.681
Yeah.

16:20.194 --> 16:22.196
Are we solid?

16:24.618 --> 16:28.665
Hey, sweetie, I just
called to say I lo...

16:28.792 --> 16:30.938
Yeah, sure,
you can call me back.

16:32.489 --> 16:34.768
It's fine.
She's just a little busy.

16:40.182 --> 16:41.611
Hey, Tammy. Aren't
you going inside?

16:41.699 --> 16:43.500
- I've been waiting for you.
- Oh.

16:43.588 --> 16:45.891
[mocking]: Oh.Oh...

16:46.680 --> 16:48.769
Yuri told me you had
a little talk with him.

16:49.648 --> 16:51.640
Okay, yes, you're mad,

16:51.728 --> 16:53.416
but I just felt
it was important

16:53.504 --> 16:55.267
- that he knew...
- He dumped me.

16:55.433 --> 16:56.951
What?
Yeah.

16:57.038 --> 17:00.041
No. No, no, no, no,
he wasn't supposed to dump you,

17:00.192 --> 17:01.218
he was supposed
to dump Sergei.

17:01.305 --> 17:02.711
He can't dump Sergei,
he's family,

17:02.799 --> 17:04.769
and he's the whole reason
Yuri's in America.

17:06.693 --> 17:08.623
I'm so sorry.
I thought we were friends.

17:08.711 --> 17:11.403
We are. That's why I did it.
I love you too much

17:11.491 --> 17:13.015
to see you go back to prison.
[scoffs]

17:13.103 --> 17:15.558
I set you up on a date,
and you ruined my life.

17:15.741 --> 17:17.058
Tammy, come on.

17:17.449 --> 17:18.848
Just a heads-up,
I'm gonna share

17:18.935 --> 17:19.730
the crap out of this in there,

17:19.818 --> 17:21.732
and I'm not gonna say your name
'cause that's not cool,

17:21.819 --> 17:24.829

Oh, they're gonna know!
