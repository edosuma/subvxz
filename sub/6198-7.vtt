00:54.950 --> 00:59.520
Min Ju, do you know where
K398 is?

01:00.160 --> 01:02.040
I can't find it.

01:10.360 --> 01:14.660
Ah, here it is.
Min Ju, thank you.

01:14.930 --> 01:18.410
The news team has been very
busy lately, right?

01:19.920 --> 01:23.750
But Min Ju, didn't you go
for training?

01:24.350 --> 01:28.320
I thought you'd be gone 3 months,
but I guess you're back early.

02:06.290 --> 02:08.490

03:08.250 --> 03:09.730
Hami!

03:12.930 --> 03:14.840
Hami, let's go home.

03:16.550 --> 03:18.670
What are you doing?

03:22.880 --> 03:23.940
Hami!

03:23.940 --> 03:25.040
Hami, come on!

03:43.560 --> 03:50.730
-=MC Audition Information

03:50.730 --> 03:53.300
Awesome, awesome. Very good.

03:54.600 --> 03:57.700
That's right. This program is
the beginning.

03:57.700 --> 04:01.190
Commercials, dramas, variety.
Everything.

04:02.470 --> 04:03.940
Just wait.

04:03.940 --> 04:06.140
They've been ignoring me all
this time, right?

04:06.140 --> 04:07.610
Now they're dead.

04:10.780 --> 04:12.750
Of course,

04:13.120 --> 04:16.420
Detective Jeong Ha Yun, I will
still acknowledge her.

04:27.580 --> 04:29.630
Bloodthirsty. Bloodthirsty.

04:30.060 --> 04:32.570
Are they detectives or gangsters?

04:33.390 --> 04:38.080
Most people would probably
consider them way above average.

04:39.750 --> 04:42.320
That's really a laugh.

04:45.510 --> 04:46.520
Hey.

04:46.610 --> 04:49.510
Han Tae Gyeong.
What are you doing here?

04:49.620 --> 04:53.120
The Department Chief
recommended I come for an
audition.

04:53.120 --> 04:54.280
What? Department Chief?

04:54.300 --> 04:55.270
Yes.

04:57.900 --> 05:01.200
The Department Chief must be
confused and senile.

05:01.970 --> 05:04.420
Then, shouldn't you have
come sooner?

05:04.640 --> 05:09.640
Women don't like slick-haired
guys like you,

05:09.670 --> 05:11.110
you know?

05:11.610 --> 05:14.050
He's very handsome.

05:14.050 --> 05:16.610
<i>I will have to work harder.</i>

05:18.450 --> 05:20.280
Don't get carried away.

05:20.510 --> 05:22.490
They weren't talking about you.

05:24.690 --> 05:26.160
And, Kid.

05:26.160 --> 05:29.830
Someone as inexperienced as
you won't be chosen.

05:29.830 --> 05:30.930
Look at me.

05:31.660 --> 05:33.870
I'm a detective at first glance.

05:34.060 --> 05:36.430
A professional.

05:39.740 --> 05:44.140
<i>This case is... the result of a
man's lust...</i>

05:45.240 --> 05:47.220
...desire caused a...

05:47.240 --> 05:48.410
brutal...

05:48.620 --> 05:50.510
massacre.

05:52.420 --> 05:54.420
Totally incomprehensible.

05:54.450 --> 05:56.000
Totally incomprehensible.

05:56.250 --> 05:57.320
Next!

05:57.490 --> 05:59.780
That's enough. You can step down.

05:59.920 --> 06:01.390
Next audition.

06:03.720 --> 06:05.430
You can begin!

06:08.160 --> 06:10.270
Just die.

06:11.500 --> 06:16.210
Go and die. Just die.

06:22.680 --> 06:25.620
Why would you die when there's
such a pretty girl?

06:25.620 --> 06:28.920
Where is the restroom?

06:46.540 --> 06:48.010
Song PD!

06:49.110 --> 06:50.210
I'm sorry.

06:50.210 --> 06:51.680
Watch where you're going.

07:07.500 --> 07:08.930
What?

07:08.930 --> 07:11.130
I know she went in here.

07:14.140 --> 07:15.280
Really?

07:15.360 --> 07:17.000
No plastic surgery is pretty?

07:17.000 --> 07:19.200
Then, I'm good like this,

07:19.200 --> 07:19.940
right?

07:20.100 --> 07:21.040
No.

07:21.140 --> 07:26.630
You have to wait for science.
Medicine won't be able to fix you.

07:26.650 --> 07:28.750
It's weird having to hear
about it.

07:32.050 --> 07:35.720
But looking at the whole picture...

07:46.360 --> 07:48.930
I didn't deliberately not answer
the phone.

07:49.360 --> 07:52.240
I really checked through all the
people in debt.

07:52.240 --> 07:54.810
In other words, you didn't find
out anything.

07:55.170 --> 07:58.840
If the police can't find someone,
how can you ask me to find
them, hyeongnim?

08:00.310 --> 08:02.880
But I think that maybe...

08:03.610 --> 08:06.550
someone might have secretly...

08:07.730 --> 08:10.960
That person, even boiling him in
shit wouldn't be enough!

08:11.010 --> 08:12.790
He was even acquitted.

08:13.160 --> 08:15.020
Hyeongnim, you should know!

08:15.100 --> 08:20.340
You can pay some foreigners
and they will use a sashimi knife...

08:21.600 --> 08:23.430
You've got 3 days...

08:23.800 --> 08:25.270
to find something.

08:25.270 --> 08:26.740
Otherwise,

08:26.740 --> 08:28.570
you'll really be dead.

08:29.310 --> 08:31.140
That hurts, hurts!

08:32.980 --> 08:34.450
Take care, hyeongnim.

08:42.150 --> 08:45.090
Where have you been going
lately without telling me?

08:45.090 --> 08:47.660
You're not meeting some other
ghost, are you?

08:48.390 --> 08:50.230
Aigoo... a ghost indeed.

08:52.430 --> 08:56.470
This guy, why isn't he here yet?

08:56.830 --> 09:01.240
He kept making noise about
getting on television,

09:01.380 --> 09:04.630
and ended up falling flat on
his face.

09:04.860 --> 09:08.210
That means Tae Gyeong oppa is
going to be on TV?

09:08.290 --> 09:10.780
Right! You'll become a celebrity!

09:11.520 --> 09:16.290
Then, I'll say bye-bye to this
person who looks down on me
and hang out at the TV station.

09:21.300 --> 09:23.660
Why are you all looking at me
like that?

09:23.710 --> 09:25.610
What kind of a case is it?

09:25.790 --> 09:29.500
Is he a goldfish or an amoeba?
He's forgotten already.

09:29.690 --> 09:33.510
Worrying about someone like
this is really not worth it.

09:33.660 --> 09:35.560
I just fell in love.

09:35.670 --> 09:36.800
Aigoo.

09:36.950 --> 09:38.680
What's wrong with that woman?

09:39.780 --> 09:41.250
What's her name?

09:41.610 --> 09:43.080
Age?

09:43.450 --> 09:46.460
All that, well, I'll find out
eventually.

09:49.690 --> 09:54.090
You're doing it again. Your
imagination is running wild.

09:54.460 --> 09:58.130
=The killer in the trunk murder
case...=

09:58.130 --> 09:59.960
You met her at the TV station?

09:59.960 --> 10:01.070
Yes.

10:01.070 --> 10:04.000
She had fair skin,

10:04.000 --> 10:05.470
with a very aloof attitude.

10:05.470 --> 10:09.510
- But mostly, she was pretty.
= Last night in the mountains
near Seoul...=

10:09.510 --> 10:13.180
- What did she look like?
= while walking through the park=

10:13.200 --> 10:14.650
=he discovered a body and
reported it to police.=

10:14.650 --> 10:16.760
She looked just like that!

10:17.280 --> 10:18.120
What is this?

10:18.120 --> 10:19.950
=The body was found to be a
GBC reporter...=

10:21.520 --> 10:23.500
<i>Hwang Min Ju, 32 years old.</i>

10:24.190 --> 10:26.390
She was a news reporter.

10:26.490 --> 10:28.750
Her family is living abroad.

10:29.000 --> 10:34.510
Her colleagues all thought she
had gone for training 2 weeks ago.

10:34.830 --> 10:39.240
Most likely, no one knew she
had gone missing.

10:42.540 --> 10:46.940
Based on decomposition, the time
of death was about 2 weeks ago.

10:48.010 --> 10:50.250
It looks like a traffic accident.

10:50.270 --> 10:51.350
Traffic accident?

10:51.350 --> 10:56.510
The leg, pelvis and shoulder
fractures are all typical of a
traffic accident.

10:56.580 --> 10:58.470
Our simulation here shows

10:58.510 --> 11:00.160
it would happen like this.

11:02.720 --> 11:08.390
But I don't understand the head
injury. The simulation can't seem
to replicate it.

11:08.730 --> 11:11.690
The skull shows a significant
blow to the back of the head.

11:11.900 --> 11:13.400
It looks like an FCCD,

11:13.400 --> 11:17.410
A skull fracture to this degree
could have caused immediate
death.

11:17.410 --> 11:20.710
So you're saying that injury and
the traffic accident were separate?

11:20.710 --> 11:23.280
We'll have to investigate further
to know for sure.

11:23.280 --> 11:25.120
<i>It will take some time.</i>

11:40.200 --> 11:43.830
Tae Gyeong oppa looks so cute
when he's concentrating.

11:56.310 --> 11:57.780
My heart is pounding!

11:59.250 --> 12:02.190
I was so nervous I thought I'd die.

12:02.190 --> 12:05.120
But aren't there any surveillance
cameras around here?

12:05.490 --> 12:08.060
As you can see, it's still under
development.

12:16.130 --> 12:17.970
What can I do?

12:19.070 --> 12:21.270
I've already turned off the air
conditioning.

12:21.640 --> 12:23.260
Is it broken?

12:34.390 --> 12:36.860
Hey!

12:37.050 --> 12:39.620
Get up. Stop playing around.

12:46.500 --> 12:50.270
Hey, get up? Who are you to
tell me what to do?

12:50.300 --> 12:53.570
You're still wet behind the ears.

12:53.750 --> 12:56.130
Don't look at me like that.
I'm a 1987.

12:56.250 --> 12:57.980
How long have you been here?

12:58.080 --> 12:59.270
Me?

12:59.810 --> 13:01.110
5 years...

13:02.190 --> 13:03.480
4 years.

13:03.510 --> 13:05.190
You can't lie to a ghost.

13:05.310 --> 13:08.750
I've been hanging around a
police station.

13:09.890 --> 13:13.920
You were in an accident 2 years
ago. How dare you lie...

13:14.290 --> 13:16.860
<i>I know there was something here.</i>

13:16.860 --> 13:19.430
It must have been a ghost.

13:22.000 --> 13:25.670
If you scare someone one more
time, I won't let you go.

13:26.770 --> 13:28.240
Eonni, wait a minute.

13:28.970 --> 13:34.480
Since you hang out at the police
station, could you do me a favor?

14:05.010 --> 14:06.610
Jong Hyeon.

14:08.250 --> 14:11.180
When I find the killer, I'll make
sure they suffer.

14:11.920 --> 14:14.120
She was really my type.

14:14.490 --> 14:16.320
You kid, seriously.

14:16.320 --> 14:17.790
Let's go now.

14:17.790 --> 14:19.990
I couldn't find anything helpful.

14:19.990 --> 14:21.460
Let's go.

14:23.290 --> 14:25.860
Oh, good grief!

14:25.860 --> 14:27.330
Be more careful!

14:28.070 --> 14:30.270
You're going to have to pay
for that.

14:36.870 --> 14:39.080
There was another photo in
there?

14:39.810 --> 14:42.750
This guy looks very familiar.

14:43.110 --> 14:44.580
Where have I seen him before?

14:44.580 --> 14:46.050
This will work out well.

14:46.420 --> 14:47.890
I will rely on you.

14:49.720 --> 14:51.560
Mr. Lee Jun Seok?

14:55.230 --> 14:56.330
Who are you?

14:56.330 --> 15:00.360
You went to college with Hwang
Min Ju and you worked together.

15:00.360 --> 15:01.830
You must have had a good
relationship.

15:01.830 --> 15:04.030
Well, that's true.

15:04.400 --> 15:06.970
But she was in the society unit
and I was in politics,

15:06.970 --> 15:08.440
so we didn't meet very often.

15:08.440 --> 15:11.010
On September 21st at 11:00 p.m.,

15:11.100 --> 15:12.990
before Hwang Min Ju's death

15:13.210 --> 15:16.510
the last person she called was you.

15:16.510 --> 15:20.180
Could you perhaps remember
what you talked about?

15:20.180 --> 15:22.750
It was probably something
work related.

15:22.750 --> 15:25.690
Because sometimes she would
call to talk about business.

15:25.690 --> 15:30.090
<i>There must have been a lot of
business then, right?</i>

15:36.700 --> 15:38.900
This wasn't just a simple
mentoring relationship.

15:38.900 --> 15:41.700
It was more than 10 years ago.
Why are you bringing that up?

15:41.840 --> 15:46.610
Because a woman who was your
colleague and a former lover
has died,

15:46.610 --> 15:47.710
but you,

15:47.800 --> 15:50.280
don't seem mentally affected
at all.

15:51.380 --> 15:53.950
So your business was different.

15:53.950 --> 15:57.250
What business did you discuss
on these phone calls?

15:57.250 --> 16:02.390
Although we were in different
departments, we still helped each
other with our stories.

16:02.760 --> 16:07.160
On a recent story, we needed to
share intelligence, so we often
spoke on the phone.

16:07.160 --> 16:09.730
Well, we only have your
word for it.

16:09.730 --> 16:12.670
May I leave now?

16:18.910 --> 16:22.950
I've told you not to be so pushy
if you don't have evidence.

16:22.950 --> 16:25.880
It was you you told me to be
pushy just a moment ago...

16:26.250 --> 16:27.720
Hey, come over here.

16:31.390 --> 16:33.960
Oh, okay. Good work.

16:35.060 --> 16:37.630
Detective Han checked the CCTV
nearby,

16:37.630 --> 16:39.830
but he didn't find any recording
of the accident.

16:40.790 --> 16:43.700
There was no one in her call
history besides Lee Jun Seok.

16:43.870 --> 16:46.630
Someone called her from a
public phone

16:46.800 --> 16:49.370
2 hours before she died.

16:50.110 --> 16:51.940
Find out who that was.

16:52.110 --> 16:53.410
After that,

16:53.650 --> 16:57.080
I think we need to investigate
Lee Jun Seok a little further.

16:57.220 --> 17:00.970
=We are 2 weeks away from
elections and each party is
campaigning hard.=

17:01.120 --> 17:06.260
=Candidates Gim U-Hyeok and
Choe Sang Hyeok have launched
an intense offense and defense.=

17:15.800 --> 17:20.200
I suspect that after the suspect
hit Reporter Hwang with the car,

17:20.200 --> 17:22.770
he moved her here to bury her.

17:22.770 --> 17:24.240
Hit and run,

17:24.980 --> 17:27.339
plus dumping a body.

17:34.640 --> 17:37.450
It feels like there's a thorn in
my throat.

17:37.520 --> 17:39.210
I'm back!

17:40.020 --> 17:42.230
See? Look how proud he is,

17:42.230 --> 17:44.690
like he's already some kind of
celebrity.

17:45.010 --> 17:47.730
Are you jealous that Tae Gyeong's
on TV?

17:51.400 --> 17:53.970
It seems like that poor old guy's
vision must really be bad.

17:53.970 --> 17:56.910
I think I've found a clue.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.780
Stay tuned for the upcoming show.

18:01.520 --> 18:04.980
When I checked Hwang Min Ju's
navigation, the last record shows

18:04.980 --> 18:08.290
3 days before her death, she
went to the Manhattan Hotel.

18:08.290 --> 18:10.850
The Manhattan, that place is
really expensive.

18:10.920 --> 18:13.730
Go check the hotel CCTV
right away.

18:13.790 --> 18:15.990
I already looked at it.

18:15.990 --> 18:18.200
<i>Aigoo. Really?</i>

18:18.560 --> 18:19.660
Hey.

18:19.660 --> 18:22.230
At least try to measure up to
Tae Gyeong.

18:22.970 --> 18:27.000
The CCTV inside the hotel
automatically updates every 15
days, so there wasn't anything.

18:27.230 --> 18:30.010
It was difficult to find the parking
garage recordings.

18:30.040 --> 18:31.300
Look at this.

18:52.700 --> 18:55.270
There is something behind all this.

18:55.270 --> 18:59.670
What are you doing? There's
something to look into. Move!

19:02.970 --> 19:04.070
Police.

19:04.070 --> 19:06.280
Where is the staff lounge?

19:08.850 --> 19:10.310
Police.

19:10.680 --> 19:11.780
Is something wrong?

19:11.780 --> 19:13.620
Please cooperate with our
investigation.

19:27.560 --> 19:29.400
May we talk for a moment?

19:30.130 --> 19:31.240
Wait. Stop!

19:31.600 --> 19:32.700
Stop!

19:41.510 --> 19:42.610
<i>Stop right there!</i>

20:12.710 --> 20:13.440
You startled me.

20:16.010 --> 20:17.110
Just a moment.

20:17.480 --> 20:20.050
Maybe over there...

20:22.990 --> 20:24.820
That's right.

20:29.960 --> 20:31.800
You know Hwang Min Ju, right?

20:31.800 --> 20:33.630
You stole her memory card
2 weeks ago.

20:33.630 --> 20:35.470
Why did you take her memory card?

20:35.470 --> 20:37.670
You're not going to say anything?

20:44.270 --> 20:46.480
This must look pretty impressive.

20:47.580 --> 20:49.410
Hey, hurry and cuff him.

20:49.780 --> 20:51.250
I forgot to bring my handcuffs.

20:51.620 --> 20:54.180
Gim U-Hyeok. A human rights
lawyer,

20:54.550 --> 20:56.750
with a handsome face that makes
ladies' hearts flutter.

20:56.750 --> 21:00.790
He is the star player in this
election with a lot of support.

21:01.530 --> 21:04.830
A rare and great thing of beauty.

21:07.760 --> 21:11.070
His wife, Yu Jeong-A, is the
accountant for the Korean
Human Rights Association.

21:11.070 --> 21:12.900
His son is studying abroad in
America.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.570
A great man like that,

21:16.570 --> 21:20.980
paid a hotel employee to steal
a memory card?

21:20.980 --> 21:24.650
What was on the memory card
that made him so desperate?

21:26.850 --> 21:29.420
Detective Jeong, don't be so
naive.

21:29.790 --> 21:32.720
What photos could you take
in a hotel?

21:33.820 --> 21:34.930
I've got it!

21:35.290 --> 21:36.760
A sudden inspiration.

21:37.130 --> 21:39.330
The murderer is Gim U-Hyeok.

21:39.700 --> 21:44.470
He may have grabbed one memory
card, but this memory card was
still around,

21:44.470 --> 21:47.770
so he also had to silence the
witness.

21:56.580 --> 21:58.780
What have you been doing?

21:58.780 --> 22:00.620
Hey, Han Tae Gyeong!

22:00.980 --> 22:03.920
I'm talking to you and you're
just listening to music?

22:04.290 --> 22:06.120
Home run!

22:06.860 --> 22:08.330
You're watching baseball!

22:10.530 --> 22:13.100
I checked Hwang Min Ju's
camera,

22:13.100 --> 22:15.300
and it has an automatic cloud
backup feature.

22:15.670 --> 22:17.130
Cloud backup?

22:18.190 --> 22:21.060
You mean it backs up to a cloud
account automatically?

22:21.170 --> 22:23.740
So I hacked the cloud account.

22:26.310 --> 22:29.610
This is the photo that Hwang Min
Ju took in the hotel.

22:29.980 --> 22:32.180
That...

22:32.180 --> 22:34.750
That's Gim U-Hyeok, right?

22:36.590 --> 22:38.420
That's just what I said, right?

22:38.790 --> 22:42.090
One look and you can tell it's
the man from the elevator.

22:42.090 --> 22:45.760
Is this photo really enough
of a motive?

22:45.760 --> 22:47.230
Fine.

22:47.230 --> 22:48.700
Detective Yun and Detective Jeong,

22:49.070 --> 22:50.530
go and question Gim U-Hyeok

22:50.530 --> 22:53.470
Tae Gyeong, you continue
investigating Gim U-Hyeok.

22:53.470 --> 22:57.510
You and I will go find out who
that woman is.

22:57.550 --> 22:58.450
Get busy.

22:58.610 --> 23:00.510
Move. Move. Move!

23:07.570 --> 23:09.000
Anyone here?

23:16.790 --> 23:17.910
<i>Yes.</i>

23:21.000 --> 23:22.830
Excuse us.

23:24.300 --> 23:25.400
Police.

23:26.720 --> 23:28.470
Is there something wrong?

23:28.710 --> 23:33.480
Last night in the mountains, the
body of GBC reporter, Hwang Min
Ju, was found.

23:33.480 --> 23:34.580
Did you know about it?

23:34.950 --> 23:37.510
I saw it on the news.
But why are you here?

23:37.510 --> 23:40.080
Because you spoke with her
on the phone.

23:40.080 --> 23:42.290
What did you speak with
her about?

23:43.590 --> 23:45.220
Did we?

23:45.590 --> 23:48.530
I don't exactly remember.

23:48.530 --> 23:52.200
Ah, sure. So you don't remember?

23:52.200 --> 23:54.770
You politicians are all the same.

24:01.000 --> 24:02.840
Was it because of this photo?

24:06.140 --> 24:07.980
<i>What are you two doing in here?</i>

24:09.450 --> 24:10.550
We're police.

24:10.550 --> 24:13.480
We're here on a case.
Please give us your assistance.

24:13.640 --> 24:15.320
I don't intend to assist you.

24:15.320 --> 24:18.990
If you have any questions,
come back with a warrant.

24:20.090 --> 24:21.560
What's going on, Chief?

24:21.930 --> 24:23.760
<i>It's nothing, Madam.</i>

24:30.730 --> 24:32.570
<i>Please leave now.</i>

24:33.300 --> 24:36.970
Then, we'll come back another
time.

24:51.290 --> 24:53.120
That was strange.

24:53.860 --> 24:55.330
What was strange?

24:55.690 --> 24:57.890
When his wife came in,

24:58.260 --> 25:01.570
I expected him to hide the
photo immediately.

25:01.930 --> 25:03.770
But Gim U-Hyeok didn't hide it.

25:04.130 --> 25:07.800
His wife didn't seem surprised
by the photo.

25:08.170 --> 25:10.740
That means his wife already
knew about it.

25:11.110 --> 25:14.040
How did that photo end up in
the hands of that detective?

25:14.040 --> 25:16.250
I don't know either.

25:16.250 --> 25:18.450
I'm positive I destroyed it.

25:18.820 --> 25:20.650
I don't know how they got it.

25:22.490 --> 25:26.520
I will find Jenny before the
detectives do.

25:26.520 --> 25:28.730
Jenny?

25:33.860 --> 25:35.700
Ah! The one in the photo!

25:36.070 --> 25:37.170
What?

25:37.530 --> 25:41.200
Then these 2 guys don't know
where she is either?

25:45.610 --> 25:47.810
What's with that expression?

25:48.180 --> 25:49.280
Don't tell me,

25:49.280 --> 25:51.850
you want to kill Jenny, too?

25:58.820 --> 26:01.020
I found out some things.

26:02.130 --> 26:03.960
That woman's name is Jenny.

26:03.960 --> 26:07.260
But, those people don't know
where she is.

26:07.260 --> 26:09.470
The Chief said they had to find
Jenny.

26:09.470 --> 26:12.040
It sounds like they're not going
to let her go.

26:12.040 --> 26:14.240
They don't know where she is.

26:14.970 --> 26:17.170
What's the use of helping you
all day long?

26:17.170 --> 26:19.010
You just look down on me
and belittle me.

26:19.380 --> 26:21.210
It's like rabbit dies, dog...

26:24.150 --> 26:25.980
You thought I'd be happy, right?

26:25.980 --> 26:27.450
Aren't we leaving yet?

26:37.360 --> 26:41.030
Right, this is the angle.
It was taken from here.

26:42.500 --> 26:45.070
Who could that woman be?

26:45.800 --> 26:47.640
Mistress?

26:47.640 --> 26:51.310
Whether she is or not, anyway
this photo...

26:51.310 --> 26:55.710
it's not really worth Gim U-Hyeok
killing Hwang Min Ju over it.

26:55.710 --> 26:59.020
There must be something else.
What do you mean, mistress?

27:00.850 --> 27:03.420
Customers, would you like to
order anything?

27:04.150 --> 27:07.820
<i>No, we're leaving soon.</i>

27:08.560 --> 27:10.030
<i>Could I have another glass of
water?</i>

27:10.030 --> 27:11.130
<i>Sure.</i>

27:11.130 --> 27:12.230
Thank you.

27:13.330 --> 27:14.800
Hold on.

27:19.570 --> 27:22.140
I swear, Kid. Seriously.

27:23.240 --> 27:25.080
Is she your ideal type, too?

27:25.080 --> 27:27.280
It's not like that.

27:30.210 --> 27:31.680
Look at this.

27:32.050 --> 27:33.880
These are numbers, right?

27:34.250 --> 27:35.350
What about it?

27:35.720 --> 27:39.020
You never catch on very quickly.
You don't see anything.

27:39.390 --> 27:40.860
Excuse me!

27:41.960 --> 27:43.060
Yes, Customer.

27:46.730 --> 27:48.930
This woman is a waitress here,
right?

27:50.030 --> 27:51.130
Waitress?

27:51.130 --> 27:52.240
Yes.

27:52.240 --> 27:54.070
But, is there a problem?

27:54.070 --> 27:55.910
We're police.

27:56.270 --> 27:58.480
Is that woman here now?

27:58.480 --> 27:59.580
No.

27:59.580 --> 28:01.780
She resigned not long ago.

28:02.510 --> 28:03.980
Chef Choe.

28:05.080 --> 28:08.020
<i>The police are looking for Jenny.</i>

28:08.750 --> 28:10.950
Why are you looking for her?

28:11.320 --> 28:16.090
=The killer who brutally murdered
GBC reporter, Hwang Min Ju,
then buried her,=

28:16.460 --> 28:18.660
=has not yet been found.=

28:18.660 --> 28:22.330
=The police are tracking the
victim's activities for the last
month...=

28:23.800 --> 28:27.100
Hurry and pack your things.
We're leaving tomorrow.

28:33.340 --> 28:35.550
Her identity card is a forgery.

28:35.550 --> 28:38.110
We can't be sure whether the
name "Jenny" is real or not.

28:38.110 --> 28:39.950
Her phone number doesn't work.

28:39.950 --> 28:41.420
How can there still be someone
like this?

28:42.520 --> 28:45.820
She's probably running from
Gim U-Hyeok and is in hiding.

28:45.820 --> 28:48.390
We have to find this girl first.

28:48.390 --> 28:49.130
Otherwise...

28:49.490 --> 28:51.690
Right. With elections coming up
soon, what wouldn't they do?

28:51.690 --> 28:53.530
They've already killed Hwang
Min Ju.

28:53.530 --> 28:57.200
Having this woman on the loose
is his most fatal weakness.

28:57.200 --> 28:59.400
Can't we use GPS to follow
Gim U-Hyeok?

28:59.400 --> 29:03.070
For whatever reason, they're also
searching for Jenny.

29:03.070 --> 29:05.820
If we can't catch a pheasant,
how about catching a chicken?

29:05.850 --> 29:06.740
Chicken?

29:07.110 --> 29:09.310
Are you saying there's an
accomplice?

29:11.510 --> 29:12.980
Gang Seong Tae.

29:12.980 --> 29:14.450
<i>He is candidate Gim U-Hyeok's
chief of staff.</i>

29:14.820 --> 29:17.390
<i>Since Gim U-Hyeok got into
politics 20 years ago,</i>

29:17.390 --> 29:19.960
he has been alongside him as
his right-hand man.

29:20.320 --> 29:23.630
He must certainly be involved
in this case.

29:23.630 --> 29:26.560
Right. It's unlikely Gim U-Hyeok
would have done this himself.

29:26.930 --> 29:28.400
Gang Seong Tae, this friend,

29:28.770 --> 29:32.070
get confirmation of his phone
calls and texts in real time.

29:32.440 --> 29:33.540
Yes.

29:34.270 --> 29:36.470
But is all of this okay?

29:36.840 --> 29:37.570
Like what?

29:37.570 --> 29:40.880
If it doesn't go well, they might
decide to disband our team.

29:40.880 --> 29:43.450
You jerk, you're always the
voice of doom.

29:43.810 --> 29:46.750
You even said it was a rare and
great thing of beauty.

29:46.750 --> 29:47.480
What's wrong with you, kid?

29:47.850 --> 29:49.690
The situation is different now.

29:50.050 --> 29:55.190
If we blunder around and poke
the wrong bear, if this guy gets
elected, he won't let us alone.

29:55.560 --> 29:58.130
It'll be all over for us in no time.

30:01.800 --> 30:04.000
Why does he look like he
saw a ghost?

30:04.000 --> 30:05.470
Don't tell me,

30:05.840 --> 30:07.300
he can see me?

30:12.440 --> 30:17.580
Reporter Hwang Min Ju...
I killed her.

30:29.690 --> 30:31.530
I stole the memory card,

30:31.900 --> 30:33.730
but I was still worried.

30:34.100 --> 30:36.670
It's hard running for election,

30:37.030 --> 30:39.970
while being fearful and
apprehensive,

30:39.970 --> 30:42.540
so I called to meet with her.

30:42.540 --> 30:45.110
<i>Let's get together and talk.</i>

30:55.390 --> 30:56.490
<i>At that time, </i>

30:56.490 --> 30:58.320
<i>I had this kind of thought...</i>

30:58.320 --> 31:00.160
If she would just disappear,

31:00.890 --> 31:03.090
everything would be fine.

31:27.320 --> 31:29.890
Why did you turn yourself in?

31:29.890 --> 31:32.820
After I came back to my senses,

31:32.820 --> 31:35.020
I was very distressed.

31:35.760 --> 31:38.330
I committed a crime and should
be punished.

31:38.330 --> 31:40.530
Isn't that the law?

31:50.440 --> 31:52.640
Why would he suddenly turn
himself in?

31:52.640 --> 31:54.480
He's in the middle of a campaign.

31:54.840 --> 31:56.310
That's right.

31:56.310 --> 31:58.510
Is there any proof that Gim
U-Hyeok is the murderer?

31:58.510 --> 32:03.290
Han Tae Gyeong, can't you sit
properly? Where do you think
you are?

32:03.290 --> 32:05.120
But it seems rather strange,

32:05.490 --> 32:06.220
don't you think?

32:06.590 --> 32:08.790
Something about it smells,

32:09.160 --> 32:14.660
but I can't tell whether it's shit
or bean paste.

32:15.030 --> 32:16.870
Ajussi, it's your feet!

32:16.870 --> 32:18.700
Seriously.

32:18.700 --> 32:24.210
Hey, you guys don't understand
it either, right?

32:27.140 --> 32:29.710
He must be hiding something.

32:29.710 --> 32:33.020
We're going to get to the bottom
of this.

32:33.020 --> 32:37.420
First we need to find this woman.
She's the key.

32:38.520 --> 32:40.360
=GBC breaking news.=

32:40.360 --> 32:44.390
=Gim U-Hyeok suddenly
surrendered himself to police.=

32:44.390 --> 32:48.800
=The candidate is suspected of
killing Hwang Min Ju and burying
her body.=

32:48.800 --> 32:52.100
What is this? Reporters must
have a crystal ball or something.

32:52.100 --> 32:52.840
Geez.

32:52.840 --> 32:55.040
=Gim U-Hyeok is now under
investigation.=

32:55.410 --> 32:58.340
=He has already admitted to
the crime.=

32:58.340 --> 33:00.180
=According to a police informant,=

33:00.540 --> 33:04.580
because the police were
tightening the net around him,
he surrendered.

33:04.950 --> 33:06.420
Along with...

33:08.620 --> 33:10.450
What's wrong with her?

33:11.190 --> 33:14.860
Along with a powerful foundation
in the current election...

33:30.640 --> 33:32.110
What the heck is she doing?

33:32.480 --> 33:34.310
Switch to the other feed,
quickly!

33:51.930 --> 33:53.400
Loyalty!

33:53.400 --> 33:54.500
Where are the others?

33:55.230 --> 33:56.700
Out running down leads.

33:57.070 --> 33:58.900
This was a surprisingly simple
case.

33:59.270 --> 34:02.210
Your team has done a great
service.

34:02.570 --> 34:05.140
Oh, my snack.

34:06.240 --> 34:07.340
Did I forget it?

34:09.179 --> 34:11.750
I've opened it. It's in a can.

34:11.750 --> 34:13.580
It's new.

34:22.760 --> 34:26.429
You probably know what's going
on out there now, don't you?

34:26.800 --> 34:29.370
The blood-sucking fish were
swarming to the smell of blood.

34:29.370 --> 34:34.500
No. They're not blood-sucking
fish. They're a bunch of sharks.

34:38.170 --> 34:40.739
If this case is closed like this,
the truth will never be known.

34:40.739 --> 34:42.580
Do everything to find that woman.

34:42.949 --> 34:44.409
I will take responsibility.

34:44.409 --> 34:45.520
Yes, I understand.

34:56.530 --> 35:00.560
This case must be handed over to
the National Police Agency
immediately.

35:00.560 --> 35:03.870
Please turn all information you
have on Gim U-Hyeok over to us.

35:03.870 --> 35:06.070
Han Dae Ji, your wings have
grown.

35:06.070 --> 35:08.270
I know you'd like to steal away
my job.

35:08.270 --> 35:10.470
I'm only following my orders.

35:10.470 --> 35:15.240
You can also take advantage of
this to lock down your position,
isn't that right?

35:15.240 --> 35:19.650
Please cooperate. I don't want
to use force.

35:19.650 --> 35:22.220
Really? Just give it a try.

35:22.220 --> 35:24.790
Okay, 1-2, 1-2.

35:24.790 --> 35:25.890
Chief.

35:25.890 --> 35:32.860
Hey, Kid. You spent 2 years
eating my mother's cooking,

35:32.860 --> 35:34.330
and what did you say?

35:34.330 --> 35:35.800
You would repay me, right?

35:35.800 --> 35:39.100
Is this how you plan to repay me?

35:39.100 --> 35:39.840
Seonbaenim!

35:39.840 --> 35:43.140
How about repaying me now?

35:43.140 --> 35:44.240
One day.

35:44.240 --> 35:45.710
Just close one eye for one day.

35:45.710 --> 35:47.910
You can do that, right?

35:47.910 --> 35:54.520
If you don't want to do that,
then spit out all that food you
ate before.

35:55.990 --> 35:58.920
If not, then kill me before you go.

35:58.920 --> 36:00.760
I'll give you 10 hours.

36:00.760 --> 36:07.730
If you're still acting like this then,
I will arrest you for obstructing
official business.

36:08.510 --> 36:10.270
Here. Isn't it here?

36:15.440 --> 36:19.480
Here and here, let's see.

36:23.150 --> 36:26.450
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

36:26.450 --> 36:29.390
That car.

36:33.420 --> 36:36.730
Seonbaenim, look at this.

36:36.730 --> 36:38.560
I looked at the campaign schedule
before.

36:38.560 --> 36:41.860
On Sept. 21, his last stop was
to the senior center,

36:41.860 --> 36:43.700
but now the whole schedule has
been deleted.

36:43.700 --> 36:47.000
But it was only deleted
4 hours ago,

36:47.000 --> 36:48.840
right before Gim U-Hyeok
surrendered.

36:48.840 --> 36:53.980
The entire schedule was deleted
before he surrendered...

36:56.180 --> 37:00.580
Find anything that was posted on
SNS about Gim U-Hyeok on
Sept. 21.

37:00.580 --> 37:02.050
Okay.

37:22.970 --> 37:27.010
Why are you lying about killing
Reporter Hwang Min Ju?

37:27.010 --> 37:28.480
Who says I'm lying?

37:28.480 --> 37:33.250
You said after the campaign visit
to the senior center, you followed
Hwang Min Ju, right?

37:33.250 --> 37:37.290
But why did you delete your
official schedule later on?

37:37.290 --> 37:39.120
I don't know what you're
talking about.

37:39.120 --> 37:43.160
We have your unofficial schedule.

37:44.630 --> 37:48.660
<i>For over 20 years, you secretly
sponsored a home for the
disabled in your hometown.</i>

37:48.660 --> 37:50.870
I killed her! Me!

37:50.870 --> 37:53.530
Why won't you believe me?

37:58.570 --> 38:00.500
Yes, Detective Lee.

38:01.190 --> 38:02.130
What?

38:02.140 --> 38:05.920
We checked the CCTV at the
crime scene and the CCTV all
around the area,

38:06.110 --> 38:11.670
and we found a suspicious vehicle
lingering at the crime scene.

38:12.150 --> 38:14.720
I checked the car and it belongs
to Choe Yong Jae.

38:14.720 --> 38:18.030
He's the chef at the hotel where
that woman used to work.

38:18.030 --> 38:22.430
I heard that chef punk and that
woman are dating.

38:22.430 --> 38:25.370
After the team leader and I were
there, he resigned immediately.

38:25.370 --> 38:27.940
Listen carefully. There are only
5 hours left.

38:27.940 --> 38:29.770
If we don't find that girl by then,

38:29.770 --> 38:32.710
Gim U-Hyeok will be handed over
to the National Police Agency.

38:32.710 --> 38:35.510
Jenny left from there.

38:36.010 --> 38:41.150
Yes. I understand, Seonbae.

38:52.160 --> 38:54.730
You check the first floor.

39:14.550 --> 39:17.850
I'll be right back.

39:26.300 --> 39:28.500
-=Candidate Gim U-Hyeok under
investigation for murder=-

40:20.250 --> 40:24.650
<i>Was it because of this you
wanted to send me to China?</i>

40:39.340 --> 40:41.170
Seonbae.

40:41.170 --> 40:43.370
Someone just sent the chief of
staff a text.

40:43.370 --> 40:44.470
It's from Jenny!

40:44.470 --> 40:47.410
Send to China? What does
that mean?

40:47.410 --> 40:51.450
Hurry and find the sender's
location.

40:52.550 --> 40:53.650
You knew about it, right?

40:53.650 --> 40:55.120
You already knew about
everything!

40:55.120 --> 40:56.950
This is the best way!
Don't you know that?

40:56.950 --> 40:58.790
Why didn't you tell me? Why?

40:58.790 --> 41:01.720
If I had told you, what would
be different?

41:01.720 --> 41:03.560
One of you had to be sacrificed.

41:03.560 --> 41:05.390
That's the solution he chose!

41:05.390 --> 41:09.430
You can't let that choice mean
nothing.

41:09.430 --> 41:13.470
But still, this isn't right.

41:13.470 --> 41:17.140
No. It was the right decision.

41:17.340 --> 41:19.220
Trust me.

41:33.660 --> 41:36.960
What? Incheon Port Terminal?

41:36.960 --> 41:38.130
Okay.

41:38.430 --> 41:41.360
So the reason Gim U-Hyeok
pretended to surrender was...

41:41.360 --> 41:45.490
to buy time for that woman to
escape.

42:39.720 --> 42:41.520
What?

42:42.500 --> 42:44.130
Stop him.

42:50.370 --> 42:53.670
Run now! Hurry!

43:28.170 --> 43:32.570
Stay away. Stay away!

43:35.880 --> 43:38.080
Calm down, Choe Yong Jae!

43:38.080 --> 43:39.920
Put the knife down.

43:39.920 --> 43:41.020
Stay away!

43:41.020 --> 43:44.320
I'll kill you!

44:21.390 --> 44:23.960
Jenny.

44:27.260 --> 44:29.470
Let's go.

44:29.470 --> 44:30.930
Jenny.

44:30.930 --> 44:32.790
<i>Yong Jae.</i>

44:52.220 --> 44:57.340
If you never killed anyone,
why did you take the blame?

44:58.830 --> 45:01.780
What were you trying to hide?

45:04.130 --> 45:07.060
This is the last piece of the puzzle.

45:11.570 --> 45:14.540
Are you ready to make a statement?

45:17.910 --> 45:27.090
Jenny is... my son.

45:27.090 --> 45:30.390
What? What does he mean by son?

45:30.390 --> 45:32.230
That woman...

45:33.700 --> 45:35.530
That... this...

45:35.530 --> 45:38.100
<i>That child was born with a
male body,</i>

45:38.190 --> 45:41.140
but he always felt he was female.

45:52.050 --> 45:54.980
<i>We argued about it constantly.</i>

45:54.980 --> 46:00.120
<i>Eventually, I sent him away to
America.</i>

46:00.120 --> 46:08.200
<i>At first, I thought I was protecting
her from being criticized. </i>

46:08.200 --> 46:17.370
But the truth is, as a political
figure, I wanted to protect myself.

46:17.370 --> 46:21.040
<i>I heard that this winter, she had
secretly returned to Korea.</i>

46:21.040 --> 46:25.450
<i>After searching everywhere, I
finally found where she worked.</i>

46:25.450 --> 46:27.650
<i>Wait.</i>

46:29.850 --> 46:32.050
<i>This is...</i>

46:32.050 --> 46:35.720
<i>This is how you really want to live?</i>

46:35.720 --> 46:37.610
<i>I'm doing fine now.</i>

46:37.800 --> 46:40.790
<i>Just leave me alone and don't
worry about me.</i>

46:42.960 --> 46:45.270
<i>Don't come to see me anymore.</i>

46:45.490 --> 46:47.700
<i>If you do, then I will really die.</i>

46:47.720 --> 46:48.790
<i>You...</i>

47:10.960 --> 47:12.060
<i>Ajussi, no...</i>

47:12.060 --> 47:13.160
<i>What's this?</i>

47:13.160 --> 47:14.630
<i>No, ajussi!</i>

47:14.630 --> 47:15.830
<i>Oh! Really.</i>

47:20.870 --> 47:23.070
<i>Destroy it.</i>

47:24.540 --> 47:30.780
The next day, she called saying
she was Reporter Hwang Min Ju.

47:30.780 --> 47:37.550
She said the photo was saved,
and if I didn't want to explain it,
she would just broadcast it.

47:46.560 --> 47:52.070
That night, I spent the whole
night thinking and came to a
difficult decision.

47:52.070 --> 47:54.270
-=Resignation Letter, Gim U-Hyeok.
South Korea People's Party=-

47:54.640 --> 47:57.570
<i>After that, I called the reporter</i>

47:57.570 --> 48:01.980
<i>and said I had resigned, so please
don't broadcast this.</i>

48:01.980 --> 48:04.910
<i>But then she said,</i>

48:04.910 --> 48:05.280
But then she said,

48:05.280 --> 48:11.150
they had already decided not to
broadcast it. I should not resign,
but continue to campaign.

48:11.150 --> 48:14.090
My child also wanted that.

48:14.090 --> 48:21.860
That was the last conversation I
had with Reporter Hwang Min Ju.

48:31.250 --> 48:33.110
What was the reason for killing
Hwang Min Ju?

48:33.120 --> 48:36.160
That was because that reporter...

48:36.250 --> 48:38.050
No.

48:39.380 --> 48:41.420
I'm the one who killed her.

48:42.280 --> 48:43.220
Jenny!

48:43.250 --> 48:45.290
I killed her.

48:45.290 --> 48:47.490
It wasn't this person.

48:47.490 --> 48:53.000
After she took my picture that
day, I quit my job.

48:53.000 --> 48:57.030
I didn't want to cause trouble
for my father's campaign.

48:57.030 --> 48:58.870
<i>This is Reporter Hwang Min Ju,
right?</i>

48:58.870 --> 49:01.070
<i>I need to talk to you about
something.</i>

49:01.070 --> 49:04.190
<i>Can we meet for a few minutes?</i>

49:06.580 --> 49:09.880
<i>I made arrangements to meet
with Reporter Hwang Min Ju.</i>

49:09.880 --> 49:15.020
I waited for a long time, but
she never showed up.

50:05.670 --> 50:08.240
<i>=Hello? Where are you?=</i>

50:08.240 --> 50:10.440
<i>=Why didn't you answer
your phone?=</i>

50:10.440 --> 50:12.270
<i>Yong Jae!</i>

50:12.270 --> 50:15.210
<i>What should I do?</i>

50:15.210 --> 50:18.900
<i>I... I...</i>

50:33.650 --> 50:36.170
<i>I killed someone.</i>

50:36.370 --> 50:39.520
<i>No. It was just an accident.</i>

50:39.630 --> 50:41.640
<i>This will work out better,</i>

50:41.640 --> 50:45.710
<i>because it will save both you
and your father.</i>

50:45.940 --> 50:48.600
<i>Don't worry. Trust me.</i>

50:49.380 --> 50:52.230
<i>I will protect you.</i>

50:58.150 --> 51:01.820
<i>I really never meant to kill
anyone.</i>

51:01.820 --> 51:08.500
<i>I only wanted to meet with her to
explain the truth and clear up any
misunderstandings.</i>

51:12.270 --> 51:17.340
So the reason you surrendered
was to cover up that Jenny
killed her?

51:17.510 --> 51:22.560
I wanted my child to live the
life she had dreamed about.

51:24.110 --> 51:27.150
I didn't want to see her lose it.

51:27.520 --> 51:31.920
If I could finally see my child
be happy,

51:31.920 --> 51:35.270
I would take the punishment
for her,

51:35.960 --> 51:39.030
and I thought that would be
enough.

51:39.480 --> 51:41.110
Oh my.

51:41.810 --> 51:45.000
How is there a father like this
in the whole world?

51:56.140 --> 51:58.130
Yes, Eonni.

51:58.350 --> 51:59.500
What?

52:00.260 --> 52:01.770
What do you mean by that?

52:01.780 --> 52:04.220
<i>After a precise inspection of the
skull fragments, </i>

52:04.220 --> 52:08.260
<i>I detected a chemical called
petroleum sulfonate.</i>

52:08.260 --> 52:10.830
It's an ingredient in anti-rust
lubricants.

52:10.830 --> 52:13.760
Apparently she was struck with
a metallic blunt object.

52:13.760 --> 52:16.330
=What is important is that the
wound had stopped bleeding.=

52:16.330 --> 52:19.630
When the body suffers trauma,
bleeding can stop on its own.

52:19.630 --> 52:25.510
But of the many injuries to Hwang
Min Ju's body, only the head
wound had stopped bleeding.

52:25.510 --> 52:27.340
So what you're saying is...

52:27.340 --> 52:30.280
all of the injuries to her body,
except for the head trauma,

52:30.280 --> 52:32.850
occurred after she had died.

52:32.850 --> 52:36.890
Does that mean she was dead
before she was hit by the car?

52:36.890 --> 52:39.070
Yes. That's right.

52:39.820 --> 52:41.770
She was already dead?

52:42.020 --> 52:47.160
Then you're saying someone
killed her and tried to disguise it
as an accident?

52:47.370 --> 52:49.300
Thank you, Eonni.

52:49.920 --> 52:53.400
In 2 hours, this case will be
handed over to the National
Police Agency.

52:53.400 --> 52:56.710
If that happens, Jenny may end
up taking the blame for this.

52:56.710 --> 53:01.110
But in that much time, how can
we come up with the real killer?

53:01.110 --> 53:03.840
You're just going to have to!

53:05.390 --> 53:09.510
First, go get the black box from
Jenny's car.

53:15.060 --> 53:19.550
If it was disguised as an accident,
something must be left behind.

53:19.830 --> 53:21.300
Wait and see.

53:21.300 --> 53:24.600
I'll show you all how great
Han Na Yeong is.

53:24.600 --> 53:25.880
Excuse me.

53:27.900 --> 53:30.470
I told you not to bother me.
You just keep following me.

53:30.650 --> 53:33.470
I'm working on a major
investigation!

53:34.340 --> 53:37.450
Eonni, please help me.

53:37.450 --> 53:39.650
You said you hang around the
police station.

53:39.650 --> 53:43.120
If I do something like that, I'll
get in trouble from Crazy Ghost.

53:44.050 --> 53:46.990
But it's just so unfair!

53:46.990 --> 53:49.500
I never went on even one date.

53:51.030 --> 53:54.330
Right, I understand how you feel.

53:54.330 --> 53:56.900
But there weren't any witnesses
to your accident.

53:56.900 --> 53:59.560
What can I do about it now?

54:00.570 --> 54:04.790
Wait! You said you're always
on this road, right?

54:06.810 --> 54:09.010
I've got the data from the black
box on Jenny's car.

54:09.010 --> 54:10.750
Let's take a look.

54:13.050 --> 54:15.830
<i>This is where she hit Hwang
Min Ju.</i>

54:15.860 --> 54:18.810
Now I'm rewinding it to 10
seconds before.

54:19.330 --> 54:22.200
Look carefully at the right side
of the picture.

54:25.300 --> 54:26.480
Okay!

54:26.830 --> 54:31.400
We can confirm that someone
killed Hwang Min Ju and then
threw her at an oncoming car.

54:31.530 --> 54:35.440
Then Jenny didn't kill anyone,
but mistakenly believed she had.

54:35.440 --> 54:39.510
The picture is too fuzzy to make
an identification.

54:40.380 --> 54:42.820
What will you do for me this time?

54:43.510 --> 54:46.500
I found conclusive evidence.

54:48.510 --> 54:51.780
I met a ghost who is very
familiar with that area.

54:51.910 --> 54:55.720
About 2 weeks ago, she saw a
strange car.

55:13.610 --> 55:14.790
Detective Han.

55:14.830 --> 55:18.010
Find videos before and after the
accident, looking for a white SUV.

55:18.010 --> 55:21.320
Detective Jeong, check all the
cars owned by people around
Hwang Min Ju.

55:21.320 --> 55:23.150
Color, style, everything. Hurry.

55:23.150 --> 55:24.320
Yes.

55:30.490 --> 55:31.590
<i>I found it!</i>

55:31.590 --> 55:34.160
There's a white FM5 parked on
the opposite corner.

55:34.300 --> 55:36.930
See? Wasn't I right?

55:37.320 --> 55:39.940
But, why this car?

55:39.970 --> 55:41.660
<i>Seonbae, over here.</i>

55:48.480 --> 55:51.050
-=Lee Jun Seok. FM5(SUV)
White color. 19JO4900=-

55:52.160 --> 55:53.970
Lee Jun Seok.

55:57.390 --> 56:01.130
Thanks to you, I will easily
win this election.

56:01.210 --> 56:02.240
It was nothing.

56:02.350 --> 56:07.310
If I'm elected, you can look
forward to something good.

56:07.700 --> 56:09.450
Thank you.

56:10.460 --> 56:12.110
Thank you.

56:23.710 --> 56:25.550
Let's all split up.

56:25.550 --> 56:27.000
<i>Okay.</i>

57:15.100 --> 57:17.230
Are you going somewhere?

57:19.310 --> 57:22.070
Detective, what are you doing
here at this hour?

57:22.070 --> 57:24.500
<i>After a precise inspection of the
skull fragments, </i>

57:24.590 --> 57:27.940
<i>I detected a chemical called
petroleum sulfonate.</i>

57:28.180 --> 57:30.680
<i>It's an ingredient in anti-rust
lubricants.</i>

57:30.690 --> 57:33.080
<i>Apparently she was struck with
a metallic blunt object.</i>

57:33.080 --> 57:39.500
Is that golf club what you used
to kill Hwang Min Ju?

57:42.890 --> 57:45.050
What ridiculous nonsense are
you talking about?

57:48.500 --> 57:51.140
Bastard, who do you think
you are?

57:56.940 --> 57:58.040
Stop!

58:28.500 --> 58:33.270
-=Why did you kill me?=-

59:00.800 --> 59:02.640
What? What's going on?

59:02.640 --> 59:04.630
Change the camera feed! Hurry!

59:05.210 --> 59:07.940
I can't change it.
It won't move.

59:08.000 --> 59:10.560
<i>Hey! What are we broadcasting
right now?</i>

59:10.580 --> 59:12.280
<i>Change it quickly!</i>

59:30.900 --> 59:33.970
Did you think this little bit would
shake me up?

59:36.510 --> 59:40.530
No. I will never collapse.

59:40.810 --> 59:43.750
Do you know how much effort it
took me to get here?

59:43.750 --> 59:46.520
I don't know how you survived!

59:48.160 --> 59:50.560
<i>You're sure about this?</i>

59:50.570 --> 59:52.550
<i>I need you to help me.</i>

59:52.550 --> 59:55.490
<i>I'm not sure I can do this alone.</i>

59:55.490 --> 59:56.960
<i>Can you keep this a secret?</i>

59:56.960 --> 59:58.450
<i>Of course.</i>

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:02.460
<i>You've worked hard.</i>

01:00:02.460 --> 01:00:04.040
<i>You're too kind.</i>

01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:07.970
<i>Sir,</i>

01:00:08.230 --> 01:00:10.170
<i>I have something important to
tell you.</i>

01:00:10.170 --> 01:00:13.110
<i>You've caught Gim U-Hyeok's
weakness?</i>

01:00:13.110 --> 01:00:16.620
<i>Yes. You can force him to
drop out.</i>

01:00:16.930 --> 01:00:18.510
<i>Is that so?</i>

01:00:18.980 --> 01:00:20.580
<i>What you want for this?</i>

01:00:20.610 --> 01:00:24.610
<i>I want to go along and help you
do great things.</i>

01:00:25.220 --> 01:00:30.360
<i>From the looks of it, you want
to help run the country.</i>

01:00:30.650 --> 01:00:35.130
<i>Don't worry. I'm not planning to
stop with just the mayor's office.</i>

01:00:35.130 --> 01:00:38.090
<i>Shouldn't our picture be a
bigger picture?</i>

01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:40.560
<i>I will talk to you again later.</i>

01:00:54.340 --> 01:00:57.930
<i>Seonbae, you were this kind of
person?</i>

01:01:23.330 --> 01:01:25.930
<i>I was wrong. I apologize. </i>

01:01:26.020 --> 01:01:27.480
<i>Let's meet.</i>

01:01:27.620 --> 01:01:29.580
<i>We need to clear up this
misunderstanding.</i>

01:01:29.640 --> 01:01:30.860
<i>What?</i>

01:01:31.580 --> 01:01:34.770
<i>You're meeting that woman?
Where?</i>

01:01:36.060 --> 01:01:37.530
<i>Meet with me first.</i>

01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:40.090
<i>Min Ju, just listen to me.</i>

01:01:40.090 --> 01:01:42.390
<i>This is our big chance. </i>

01:01:42.410 --> 01:01:43.030
<i>Understand?</i>

01:01:43.030 --> 01:01:44.700
<i>Is this why you wanted to meet
with me?</i>

01:01:44.710 --> 01:01:47.070
<i>You... said you wanted to do
the news, right?</i>

01:01:47.070 --> 01:01:48.170
<i>This isn't anything.</i>

01:01:48.170 --> 01:01:51.670
<i>I will put in a good word for you,
just give me that photo. </i>

01:01:51.700 --> 01:01:53.660
<i>I'll take care of everything.</i>

01:01:54.780 --> 01:01:58.450
<i>This involves important people.
Please!</i>

01:01:58.450 --> 01:02:00.650
<i>You know it's all dirty water.</i>

01:02:00.650 --> 01:02:03.220
<i>If we just grab this opportunity,
you and I...</i>

01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:04.770
<i>Dirty?</i>

01:02:05.050 --> 01:02:07.260
<i>Who is the truly dirty one here?</i>

01:02:07.260 --> 01:02:11.120
<i>Seonbae, are you the Lee Jun
Seok that I know?</i>

01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:20.470
<i>Which file is it in?
Where is the photo?</i>

01:02:20.670 --> 01:02:21.940
<i>I deleted it.</i>

01:02:22.140 --> 01:02:25.240
<i>I knew you'd be like this.</i>

01:02:31.110 --> 01:02:35.880
<i>Deleted? Deleted?</i>

01:02:57.170 --> 01:02:59.010
Spare me!

01:02:59.010 --> 01:03:01.210
I never meant to kill you.

01:03:01.210 --> 01:03:05.610
Min Ju! Min Ju...

01:03:45.250 --> 01:03:50.780
Believe me, Min Ju!

01:03:54.060 --> 01:03:56.260
Min Ju! Min Ju!

01:03:56.260 --> 01:04:01.040
I'm sorry, Min Ju!

01:04:02.870 --> 01:04:08.380
<i>If you had just give me that
photo, I wouldn't have done it!</i>

01:04:11.680 --> 01:04:15.350
<i>Min Ju, don't do it.</i>

01:04:15.350 --> 01:04:17.550
<i>Forgive me.</i>

01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:23.060
<i>Min Ju!</i>

01:04:25.990 --> 01:04:29.120
Killing Min Ju was a mistake.

01:04:29.660 --> 01:04:31.980
It was a mistake!

01:04:54.990 --> 01:04:57.930
=Police went to the GBC station
to arrest Reporter Lee Jun Seok=

01:04:57.930 --> 01:05:00.490
=on suspicion of murder.=

01:05:00.490 --> 01:05:03.430
There won't be any problems
with their broadcasts, right?

01:05:03.430 --> 01:05:06.730
We corrected the errors, so
it should be fine.

01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:11.020
Even though Hwang Min Ju died,
it's fortunate she was a good
reporter.

01:05:11.060 --> 01:05:13.340
At least she can be at ease in
Heaven.

01:05:13.340 --> 01:05:14.440
Right?

01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:17.010
You know it's all thanks to me.

01:05:17.010 --> 01:05:20.310
Oh? What does that look mean?

01:05:20.310 --> 01:05:24.720
Seonbaenim, there's something
I want to ask you.

01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:25.450
Like what?

01:05:25.450 --> 01:05:29.120
That high school student,
what is her name?

01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:29.860
<i>Me?</i>

01:05:29.860 --> 01:05:32.430
Han Na Yeong. Han Na Yeong.

01:05:32.640 --> 01:05:35.400
What are you doing?
Hurry and tell her.

01:05:37.210 --> 01:05:39.220
Han Na Yeong.

01:05:39.330 --> 01:05:41.540
Han Na Yeong?

01:05:42.340 --> 01:05:44.390
That's pretty.

01:05:44.730 --> 01:05:46.330
She's here, isn't she?

01:05:46.340 --> 01:05:48.210
Eonni, I'm right here!

01:05:48.210 --> 01:05:50.410
Na Yeong. Thank you.

01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:52.500
I'll rely on you from now on.

01:05:53.350 --> 01:05:59.590
Ah, what's going on?
I feel like crying.

01:06:01.060 --> 01:06:02.160
What?

01:06:02.220 --> 01:06:04.140
What did Na Yeong say?

01:06:07.660 --> 01:06:10.230
She said you don't need to
thank her.

01:06:10.230 --> 01:06:12.430
She only did what was right.

01:06:12.430 --> 01:06:14.640
Are you jealous?

01:06:14.640 --> 01:06:17.570
You big fibbing fibber.

01:06:32.250 --> 01:06:33.720
Listen, hyeongnim.

01:06:33.720 --> 01:06:36.660
I think this bastard, Yang Hyeon
Mu, has illegally emigrated.

01:06:36.660 --> 01:06:39.230
He asked me for a fake passport.

01:06:39.230 --> 01:06:43.630
<i>He had a look like he was
being chased by loan sharks.</i>

01:06:43.630 --> 01:06:46.200
<i>The threatened me not to take
away their livelihood.</i>

01:06:46.200 --> 01:06:47.670
<i>This is ours, don't you know?</i>

01:06:47.670 --> 01:06:49.870
Something was just weird!

01:06:49.870 --> 01:06:52.440
So, I asked them who they
were looking for.

01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:57.210
Turns out, it was Lee Jae Hun!

01:06:57.210 --> 01:06:59.780
<i>The rich boy that you had arrested.</i>

01:06:59.780 --> 01:07:01.980
That guy who made that drug
called "Kiss" or whatever.

01:07:01.980 --> 01:07:06.390
He was acquitted because of
insufficient evidence and then
just vanished.

01:07:06.510 --> 01:07:11.500
Apparently, his family is offering
a big reward to find their son.

01:07:19.230 --> 01:07:20.330
<i>According to what you said, </i>

01:07:20.330 --> 01:07:23.640
I checked the phone logs again
for Lee Jae Hun and Yang Hyeon
Mu.

01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:26.940
Only one number appears
consistently.

01:07:26.940 --> 01:07:32.080
It was Han Gyu Hyeok. He was
the lawyer in both cases.

01:07:35.750 --> 01:07:39.420
Han Gyu Hyeok.

01:07:41.260 --> 01:07:44.560
It's Han Gyu Hyeok.

01:08:06.580 --> 01:08:11.350
<i>Yang Hyeon Mu. No matter what,
you must find him!</i>

01:08:28.240 --> 01:08:30.069
What are you doing here?

01:08:30.069 --> 01:08:33.740
That's what I should ask you.

01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:46.220
Lee Jae Hun and Yang Hyeon Mu
have disappeared since they were
acquitted. Did you know?

01:08:48.060 --> 01:08:50.990
Department Chief Gang Gi Yeong!

01:08:51.729 --> 01:08:57.970
Just what is your relationship
with Han Gyu Hyeok?

01:09:24.020 --> 01:09:26.229
-=Next Episode Preview=-

01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:30.260
<i>The criminal came through the
window.</i>

01:09:30.260 --> 01:09:32.470
<i>Fingerprints, footprints.
Wasn't there anything?</i>

01:09:32.470 --> 01:09:35.399
<i>What is this creepy feeling?</i>

01:09:35.399 --> 01:09:36.140
<i>What's this?</i>

01:09:36.140 --> 01:09:37.970
<i>The 17th victim.</i>

01:09:37.970 --> 01:09:40.910
<i>That case is starting over after
17 years.</i>

01:09:40.910 --> 01:09:43.109
<i>I have something to tell you
about that case 17 years ago.</i>

01:09:43.109 --> 01:09:44.580
<i>Killed after receiving a phone call.</i>

01:09:44.580 --> 01:09:46.779
<i>Why are you making these
irresponsible remarks again?</i>

01:09:46.779 --> 01:09:47.740
<i>I asked who you killed.</i>

01:09:47.770 --> 01:09:48.250
<i>Tell me.</i>

01:09:48.250 --> 01:09:49.930
<i>It was you, wasn't it?
</i>

01:09:49.939 --> 01:09:51.920
<i>I killed them all.</i>

01:09:51.939 --> 01:09:53.500
<i>A rainy day outside?</i>

01:09:53.520 --> 01:09:54.890
<i>I have saved countless people!</i>

01:09:54.890 --> 01:09:55.910
<i>My decision was correct!</i>

01:09:55.910 --> 01:09:58.780
<i>The one who truly made him a
monster was you.</i>
