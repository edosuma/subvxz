18:43.206 --> 18:44.537
I like it.

18:45.083 --> 18:47.199
Reminds me of
when we first met.

18:50.547 --> 18:52.378
God, we were kids.

18:53.842 --> 18:55.548
It was fly.

19:07.480 --> 19:12.270
You should get some sleep.
You didn't get much
last night.

19:13.778 --> 19:15.279
I slept as much as you did.

19:15.363 --> 19:17.479
Mmm-mmm.
I heard you getting up.

19:18.283 --> 19:19.898

19:21.661 --> 19:22.901
I did?

19:39.888 --> 19:41.424
What's wrong, baby?

19:46.061 --> 19:47.301

19:50.607 --> 19:52.973
Oh, I missed you.

19:54.444 --> 19:56.105
I missed you, too.

19:58.948 --> 20:01.485
I guess the flying Petrelli
didn't fly.

20:01.576 --> 20:04.283
We were on the train together
and suddenly he started
carrying on about

20:04.371 --> 20:08.455
a mysterious traveler
who stopped time and told
him to save a cheerleader.

20:08.833 --> 20:12.200
It was all very fascinating.
I should write a paper
on the experience.

20:12.295 --> 20:14.502
Maybe you provoked him
with sarcasm.

20:14.589 --> 20:17.296
Peter Petrelli went from
steady as a clam to,
as you say,

20:17.384 --> 20:20.797

No provocation whatsoever.

20:20.887 --> 20:23.219

from a time traveler.

20:23.473 --> 20:24.553
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

20:24.641 --> 20:26.757
Well, so would you.

20:27.769 --> 20:31.387
Did I tell you that the man
who paints the future
is a heroin addict?

20:31.481 --> 20:33.142
Did you see
any of the paintings?

20:33.233 --> 20:34.439
I didn't see him.

20:34.526 --> 20:38.189
After what I witnessed
on the train, I doubt
he even exists.

20:38.738 --> 20:41.901
Now what?
You'll just take Papa Suresh
back to India?

20:41.991 --> 20:44.482
Just get on a plane
and that's it?

20:45.328 --> 20:47.159
Yes, that's exactly it.

20:48.206 --> 20:50.322
Well, what about Mohinder?

20:51.501 --> 20:53.913
We were no good
for each other anyway.

20:56.214 --> 21:00.207
Thank you, Eden,
for all that you've done
for both me and my father.

21:01.636 --> 21:05.754
You're welcome.
You know, you can go back
and scatter those ashes,

21:05.849 --> 21:08.181
but you're always going to
wonder if maybe there was
something to what

21:08.268 --> 21:11.760
your father was doing.
If you just looked again.

21:14.399 --> 21:17.106
Will I?
Oh, yeah.
You're not done here.

21:17.193 --> 21:18.979
That's why I'm not even
going to say goodbye.

There won't be
any more running.

going to go away.

that woman's name.

in your back seat,
and you can give me a lift.

start to wonder.

wonder about me again.

33:56.285 --> 33:58.241
Like I always do.

33:58.954 --> 34:01.161
Are you getting back together
or not?

34:03.918 --> 34:05.283
I don't know.

34:08.714 --> 34:10.045
I hope so.

34:11.300 --> 34:13.791
And this is what
we're going to do now.

34:16.972 --> 34:19.634
You're gonna get the money,
and you're going to take Micah

34:19.725 --> 34:22.467
as far away from D.L.
as you can.

34:22.561 --> 34:24.847
I'll do the rest.
D.L. can take care of me.

34:26.440 --> 34:29.307
I don't need you.
Niki, he'll think
you're crazy.

34:31.320 --> 34:34.778
And then he'll take
Micah away from us.
He'll put it all together,

34:34.865 --> 34:36.366
and when he does,

34:37.743 --> 34:40.735
it's really only a question of
whether he kills you
before he leaves.

34:41.747 --> 34:44.113
Dad, you know how
you have a secret?

34:45.709 --> 34:46.698
Mmm-hmm.

34:48.295 --> 34:50.331
Mom has a secret, too.

34:50.714 --> 34:52.454
So, you have a choice.

34:53.342 --> 34:56.505
You can let D.L. take our son
away from us forever

34:57.471 --> 35:01.259
or you can do
exactly what I say.

35:08.691 --> 35:11.182
Where's the money?

35:11.443 --> 35:12.558
Good choice.

35:21.704 --> 35:22.693
(SPEAKING IN JAPANESE)

36:31.774 --> 36:36.643
Where's your father? I mean,
not your biological father,
but, you know, your dad.

36:37.738 --> 36:40.024
He's walking out
the bio-parents.

36:40.115 --> 36:42.982
Is that what you're calling
them? The bio-parents?

36:43.077 --> 36:46.535
Oh, that's so cold
and impersonal and fitting.

36:47.790 --> 36:51.328
Thanks again for coming out.
I know your visit
meant a lot to Claire.

36:51.418 --> 36:54.285
When I was her age,
I had enough
weighing on my head.

36:54.380 --> 36:55.916
I'm glad I could help.

36:59.343 --> 37:00.708
Thanks.

37:05.682 --> 37:07.968
I think that went pretty well.

37:09.186 --> 37:10.392
MR. BENNET: Yeah.

37:10.813 --> 37:13.304
If there's anything else
you need...

37:13.899 --> 37:15.435
I'll keep you posted.

37:18.153 --> 37:20.530
Was it what
you were hoping for?

37:22.825 --> 37:25.988
I mean,
I don't know
what I was hoping for.

37:26.412 --> 37:29.324
I guess ljust wanted them
to tell me who I am.

37:30.332 --> 37:32.948
They don't know
any better than I do.

37:34.336 --> 37:37.123
Baby, nobody can tell you
who you are.

37:37.214 --> 37:40.672
That's just something
you've got to figure out
for yourself.

37:44.555 --> 37:47.171
Can we throw these away?
Are they burnt?

37:47.266 --> 37:50.633
No, I'm just afraid
I'll eat them all if we don't.

37:51.186 --> 37:53.768
You know, I have to hand it
to your dad.

37:53.856 --> 37:57.599
This isn't the first
time we've tried to find
those bio-parents.

37:58.152 --> 37:59.187
It's not?

37:59.278 --> 38:00.267
Mmm-mmm.

38:00.821 --> 38:02.186
When you were a baby,

38:02.281 --> 38:05.648
we thought you had something
wrong with your chromosomes,
some disease.

38:05.742 --> 38:09.109
We needed to screen
your parents to see
if they were carriers.

38:09.204 --> 38:12.662
l was scared to death,
and they were nowhere
to be found.

38:13.208 --> 38:17.121
What kind of disease?
How did you know there was
something wrong with me?

38:17.504 --> 38:20.416
Well, nothing was wrong
with you. You were fine.
It's just...

38:20.507 --> 38:22.543
I don't know,
one of those things.

38:22.634 --> 38:23.623
What things?

38:24.219 --> 38:27.177
I mean, was I doing
anything abnormal?

38:27.264 --> 38:29.220
You had a cough, Claire.

38:29.933 --> 38:33.050
Don't turn
hypochondriac on me.
Your brother's bad enough.

38:33.979 --> 38:35.389
Come on, you.

38:41.236 --> 38:44.444
So, was that as scary for you
as it was for me?

38:45.824 --> 38:48.691
You're a very brave man, Dad.

39:48.929 --> 39:50.635
Oh, God.

39:52.808 --> 39:54.298
All this time...

40:04.820 --> 40:07.402
I can explain.
Played me for a fool,
set me up.

40:07.489 --> 40:10.606
No, I can explain
everything. I know...

40:10.742 --> 40:12.994
I know what this
looks like. No.
I loved you, Niki.

40:13.078 --> 40:15.444
No, there is this other
person. I can't control it.

40:15.539 --> 40:18.246
I don't know what's
happening to me.

40:18.333 --> 40:19.869
I'm taking Micah.

40:19.960 --> 40:21.951
And I'm taking the money.

40:24.047 --> 40:25.503
Goodbye, Niki.

40:28.010 --> 40:29.500
You're not taking anything.

40:32.848 --> 40:35.590
Mom, is everything okay?

40:35.684 --> 40:37.265
Everything's fine.

40:38.228 --> 40:42.688
Your dad and l are just moving
furniture. Go to your room.

41:01.001 --> 41:03.367
So, this is how you
got out ofjail.

41:06.923 --> 41:07.912
(GRUNTING)

41:12.054 --> 41:13.214
Mom?

42:06.733 --> 42:08.189
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

42:20.664 --> 42:22.325
Isaac Mendez?

42:24.418 --> 42:25.498
Who are you?

42:25.585 --> 42:29.624
I'm an admirer of your work.
May I come in?

42:32.759 --> 42:37.048
MOHINDER: Evolution is
an imperfect and often
violent process.

42:38.056 --> 42:40.718
Morality loses its meaning.

42:40.809 --> 42:45.803
The question of good and evil
reduced to one simple choice,

42:47.315 --> 42:49.806
survive or perish.
