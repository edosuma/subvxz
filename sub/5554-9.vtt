WEBVTT

00:03.387 --> 00:05.387
(rhythmic beeping and whooshing)

00:05.389 --> 00:08.423
She's very weak, but most
of the mucous has been suctioned

00:08.425 --> 00:09.824
from her lungs,
she's breathing easier.

00:09.826 --> 00:11.158
So we can remove the tube?

00:11.160 --> 00:13.010
Goal is to have it out
later today.

00:13.011 --> 00:14.861
But once her lungs start filling
with fluid, I want it back.

00:14.863 --> 00:16.829
Walter.
I want it back in.

00:16.831 --> 00:18.797
DOCTOR:
Of course.

00:18.799 --> 00:20.965
I, um, have
to finish my rounds,

00:20.967 --> 00:23.300
but I'll check on her
again when I'm through.

00:23.302 --> 00:26.269
Thank you.

00:26.271 --> 00:27.870
(door opens)

00:27.872 --> 00:29.504
(door closes)

00:29.506 --> 00:31.472
I can't believe
you got a court order

00:31.474 --> 00:33.073
to have your sister intubated.

00:33.075 --> 00:34.507
I'm saving her life.

00:34.509 --> 00:36.175
You know
she didn't want the tube.

00:36.177 --> 00:38.277
It scares her, it hurts her.

00:38.279 --> 00:40.512
She's on pain meds. Is
that what you've come to?

00:40.514 --> 00:43.815
Hiring a connected lawyer,
bamboozling some emergency

00:43.817 --> 00:45.917
surrogate court magistrate
in the middle of the night

00:45.919 --> 00:47.184
with your 197 IQ,

00:47.186 --> 00:49.319
having your sister

00:49.321 --> 00:52.121
declared unfit to make her own
medical decisions? Her decisions

00:52.123 --> 00:54.490
would've resulted in her dying
before I could save her,

00:54.492 --> 00:56.192
so, by definition,
she is unfit.

00:56.193 --> 00:57.893
And if you had just gotten
her to do the smart thing

00:57.895 --> 00:59.928
on her own, then none of this
would've been necessary.

00:59.930 --> 01:01.863
Walter, this is not your call.

01:01.865 --> 01:03.898
Really? 'Cause I have a court
order saying that it is.

01:07.870 --> 01:09.836
What's this?

01:09.838 --> 01:11.571
She said you gave it to
her when you were kids.

01:11.573 --> 01:14.140
Wanted you to have it even
though it's not a Lamborghini.

01:15.276 --> 01:16.808
Some day,
I'll pay you back.

01:16.810 --> 01:18.109
I'll take a
Lamborghini.

01:18.111 --> 01:20.911
Bright yellow.
Race you!

01:20.913 --> 01:22.946
I'll get her a real one
when she gets better,

01:22.948 --> 01:26.316
because she will...
now that I'm in charge.

01:26.318 --> 01:28.284
(rhythmic beeping)

01:28.286 --> 01:30.552
RAY:
<i> What is that?</i>

01:30.554 --> 01:32.954
Knees up! Knees up! Knees up!
Knees up! Knees up! Knees up!

01:32.956 --> 01:34.522
Knees up! Knees up! Look
at me. It's not the size

01:34.524 --> 01:35.990
of the fight in the
dog that matters.

01:35.992 --> 01:37.291
It's the size of the
dog in the fight.

01:37.293 --> 01:38.992
I think you got that backwards.

01:38.994 --> 01:40.794
Please don't question the
coach! Okay, thank you!

01:40.795 --> 01:42.595
All right, we're gonna
do 15 pushups right now.

01:42.597 --> 01:45.064
Go! One. What are
you doing to my son?

01:45.066 --> 01:47.433
Hey, Peggy. I'm just
helping with his homework.

01:47.435 --> 01:48.934
His report card
was a tad subpar.

01:48.936 --> 01:50.902
He gets straight A's.
Not in gym.

01:50.904 --> 01:52.303
Ralph doesn't care about gym.

01:52.305 --> 01:53.654
All boys care about gym.

01:53.655 --> 01:55.004
It's<i> Lord of the Flies</i> in there.

01:55.007 --> 01:57.140
And getting picked last
is painful, trust me.

01:57.142 --> 01:59.442
I'm not sure I like him telling
you guys things instead of me.

01:59.444 --> 02:01.444
He's one of us. We get him.

02:01.446 --> 02:04.280
(Ray laughs)
Hey, what is all this?

02:04.282 --> 02:06.015
Hey, Walt. I'm doing...

02:06.017 --> 02:07.249
Oh.
Ralph!

02:07.251 --> 02:08.483
You-you okay?

02:08.485 --> 02:10.218
You all
right, buddy?

02:10.220 --> 02:11.919
I'm okay.
(car horn toots)

02:11.921 --> 02:13.854
Oh. Carpool. Okay.

02:13.856 --> 02:15.856
I got picked last
a few times myself.

02:15.858 --> 02:17.624
Don't let it bother you.
Come on, champ.

02:17.626 --> 02:18.992
You're all
right. Ease up.

02:18.994 --> 02:21.961
Let's go.
Ease up. Come on.

02:21.963 --> 02:23.896
How's Megan?

02:23.898 --> 02:25.364
Oh, she'll get well.

02:26.567 --> 02:30.468
Look, Walter,
I know it's your nature

02:30.470 --> 02:33.037
to see a problem
and want to solve it,

02:33.039 --> 02:34.872
but some things...

02:34.874 --> 02:37.174
there just aren't answers to,
and I want to make sure

02:37.176 --> 02:39.509
you're preparing yourself
emotionally for that.

02:39.511 --> 02:41.077
You know, just in case.

02:41.079 --> 02:42.912
(door opens) CABE:
Come on, gather up.

02:42.914 --> 02:44.046
We got a big one.

02:44.048 --> 02:45.981
Oh, we can continue
this.... later?

02:45.983 --> 02:48.016
No need to.

02:48.018 --> 02:49.417
I'll be fine, and...

02:49.419 --> 02:51.218
(clears his throat)
...Megan will be, too.

02:53.355 --> 02:55.021
This is Olivia
Cromwell, Director

02:55.023 --> 02:57.023
of British Intelligence, and

02:57.025 --> 02:59.358
this is one of her
agents, Ian Gleason.

02:59.360 --> 03:00.525
Since when do we work for MI6?

03:00.527 --> 03:02.026
CABE:
Since I said so.

03:02.028 --> 03:03.927
MI6 will be taking
the lead on this case.

03:03.929 --> 03:05.261
Homeland will provide support.
TOBY: Are we headed

03:05.263 --> 03:07.162
to England for a spot of tea?
CROMWELL:  No.

03:07.164 --> 03:09.264
New York, and there won't be
any time for tea.

03:09.266 --> 03:10.465
Our target

03:10.467 --> 03:12.667
is Jonas Madaky,
Ambassador to the U.S.

03:12.669 --> 03:15.036
from the African nation
of Buritan.

03:15.038 --> 03:16.721
His title was
acquired by a bribes

03:16.722 --> 03:18.405
so that he could travel
with diplomatic immunity

03:18.408 --> 03:20.141
and avoid prosecution.

03:20.143 --> 03:22.009
Prosecution for what?
Madaky's

03:22.011 --> 03:23.577
real profession
is gun runner.

03:23.579 --> 03:24.945
He supplies
internationally-banned

03:24.947 --> 03:26.346
weapons to war-torn nations

03:26.348 --> 03:28.114
in Latin American and Africa.

03:28.116 --> 03:29.949
The "soldiers" in this photo

03:29.951 --> 03:31.583
are 14 years old.

03:31.585 --> 03:33.384
The bullets inside them
are Madaky's.

03:33.386 --> 03:35.386
Why hasn't he been arrested?
Because what

03:35.388 --> 03:37.921
MI6 knows and what we can prove
are two different things.

03:37.923 --> 03:39.923
Madaky's a
security obsessive.

03:39.925 --> 03:41.457
He never travels
without his own guards,

03:41.459 --> 03:42.958
often brings his own

03:42.960 --> 03:44.492
personalized security devices.

03:44.494 --> 03:46.360
It's very hard to get near him.

03:46.362 --> 03:47.694
But he's giving a speech
at the UN.

03:47.696 --> 03:49.062
which provides an opportunity.

03:49.064 --> 03:50.363
CABE:
The speech is a request

03:50.365 --> 03:52.098
for financial aid
to his native land.

03:52.100 --> 03:55.134
But the real reason for the
UN visit is a covert meeting

03:55.136 --> 03:57.035
with Suuto Ali,
a Delegate from Tesopo.

03:57.037 --> 03:59.103
We believe they're making
a plan to send Tesopo

03:59.105 --> 04:01.572
arms to take out tens
of thousands of rebels

04:01.574 --> 04:03.407
who want a more democratic form
of government.

04:03.409 --> 04:05.275
CROMWELL: I was an aid
worker in Buritan. I've seen

04:05.277 --> 04:08.211
firsthand the suffering that
Madaky and his weapons caused.

04:08.213 --> 04:09.946
What is our mission?

04:09.948 --> 04:11.580
When Madaky and Ali meet,
they'll converse

04:11.582 --> 04:13.181
in a nearly extinct
Koisan language.

04:13.183 --> 04:15.416
Less than 12 people on
earth can translate it.

04:15.418 --> 04:18.185
There's limited source material,
and it takes years to learn it.

04:18.187 --> 04:19.452
Gleason is fluent.

04:19.454 --> 04:21.220
TOBY:
A linguist who doesn't speak.

04:21.222 --> 04:23.021
How ironic.
GLEASON:  I'm fluent

04:23.023 --> 04:25.590
in 60 languages,
proficient in another 12.

04:25.592 --> 04:27.325
Oh, really?
Do you know this one?

04:27.327 --> 04:29.026
Your owtiebay is amelay.

04:29.028 --> 04:30.427
PAIGE:
Why a linguist?

04:30.429 --> 04:32.095
Can't you just sneak
a recording device or something?

04:32.097 --> 04:33.496
HAPPY:
No, recording isn't

04:33.498 --> 04:36.031
allowed anywhere in the UN
except the General Assembly.

04:36.033 --> 04:39.067
To keep everyone honest, they
use auditory spectral masking--

04:39.069 --> 04:40.234
white noise audiograms

04:40.236 --> 04:41.435
at frequencies you can't hear,

04:41.437 --> 04:43.270
but recording devices pick up.

04:43.272 --> 04:45.138
You can record,
but you just get static.

04:45.140 --> 04:46.606
CROMWELL:
That's why

04:46.608 --> 04:48.307
you need to bypass
UN security

04:48.309 --> 04:50.142
so that Gleason
can get close enough

04:50.144 --> 04:52.477
to overhear the conversation
between Madaky and Ali.

04:52.479 --> 04:54.145
He'll decipher
the when and where

04:54.147 --> 04:56.080
of the weapon exchange.

04:56.082 --> 04:58.082
We'll intercept it,
arrest Madaky,

04:58.084 --> 05:00.584
and save innumerable
innocent lives.

05:00.586 --> 05:03.219
Can't MI6 and Homeland work
with the UN Security Council

05:03.221 --> 05:05.487
to get access for your linguist?
COOPER: The evidence against

05:05.489 --> 05:08.490
Madaky was been obtained
via illegal wiretap

05:08.492 --> 05:10.058
and satellite imagery.

05:10.060 --> 05:12.093
It proves Madaky's evil,
but it can't be used

05:12.095 --> 05:14.061
as the basis
for a Security Council request.

05:14.063 --> 05:15.662
CROMWELL: Cooper and
I will monitor you

05:15.664 --> 05:18.064
from the Homeland Security
office in New York,

05:18.066 --> 05:19.398
while you use your brainpower

05:19.400 --> 05:21.600
to get Gleason inside
the UN undetected.

05:21.602 --> 05:24.169
Do this, and people live.

05:24.171 --> 05:26.037
We have to do it
without Sylvester.

05:26.039 --> 05:28.339
I don't want her alone.
You guys okay with this?

05:28.341 --> 05:29.406
I'm in.

05:29.408 --> 05:30.640
The man helps kids kill kids.

05:30.642 --> 05:32.174
Let's get him.

05:32.176 --> 05:33.308
WALTER:
Chief Cromwell,

05:33.310 --> 05:34.609
what is security like?

05:34.611 --> 05:36.744
The UN has three rings
of security.

05:36.746 --> 05:39.012
This outer ring
is New York City,

05:39.014 --> 05:41.014
patrolled by NYPD-mounted SWAT.

05:41.016 --> 05:43.182
Points around the outside of
the building indicating cameras.

05:43.184 --> 05:45.117
Happy, see what I see?

05:45.119 --> 05:49.020
Okay, assume a 3.6
millimeter focal length,

05:49.022 --> 05:50.788
he'll get a blind spot
right about here.

05:50.790 --> 05:52.489
PAIGE: Well, why worry
about blind spots?

05:52.491 --> 05:54.357
You're a master at fake
IDs. Whip something up.

05:54.359 --> 05:55.791
I can make stuff
that looks good,

05:55.793 --> 05:58.160
but official UN
IDs have holograms

05:58.162 --> 05:59.528
that take days
to counterfeit.

05:59.530 --> 06:00.795
As soon as the cops swipe them

06:00.797 --> 06:02.196
through the readers,
we're busted.

06:02.198 --> 06:03.463
Well, standard SWAT formation

06:03.465 --> 06:05.231
places a mounted officer there

06:05.233 --> 06:06.799
so that blind spot
doesn't help us.

06:06.801 --> 06:08.701
Unless we can
distract that horse.

06:08.702 --> 06:10.602
They're prey animals. If we had
pheromones from in-heat horses

06:10.604 --> 06:13.037
of both genders... RAY:
My buddy at the track

06:13.039 --> 06:14.038
can get us
some horse pee.

06:14.040 --> 06:15.339
Hey. I'm Ray.

06:15.341 --> 06:17.174
Tell the queen
I said, "What's up?"

06:21.313 --> 06:23.579
TOBY: <i> Horses have schnozzes</i>
<i> second only to dogs,</i>

06:23.581 --> 06:27.082
<i> so I can pour out the urine </i>
<i>far enough away to not be seen,</i>

06:27.084 --> 06:29.651
<i> but close enough</i>
<i> for the steed to smell it.</i>

06:29.653 --> 06:32.153
(neighing) <i> As Trigger looks</i>
<i> for his mating partner,</i>

06:32.155 --> 06:35.122
<i> we sneak past that first layer</i>
<i> of security.</i>

06:35.124 --> 06:36.690
CROMWELL:
Next layer's trickier.

06:36.692 --> 06:38.158
Full body scanners

06:38.160 --> 06:39.726
with state-of-the-art,

06:39.727 --> 06:41.293
triple rotation
millimeter wave imaging.

06:41.296 --> 06:44.096
That's here in this area,
which is deemed Federal land.

06:44.098 --> 06:45.097
CABE: Well, you
get caught there,

06:45.099 --> 06:46.164
it's off to Leavenworth.

06:46.166 --> 06:47.465
Scanners aren't a problem.

06:47.467 --> 06:49.633
It's not like we're carrying in
guns or anything.

06:49.635 --> 06:51.301
But we will be carrying
items necessary

06:51.303 --> 06:53.436
to get us through the
final layer of security

06:53.438 --> 06:55.171
that I'm looking at
over here.

06:55.173 --> 06:57.606
Now those items can't be
spotted by the scanners.

06:57.608 --> 06:59.608
No jumping ahead
to the next phase please.

06:59.610 --> 07:01.176
They're geniuses.
They always jump ahead.

07:01.178 --> 07:02.343
I'm with Mrs. Doubtfire here.

07:02.345 --> 07:03.410
I mean, who
cares about

07:03.412 --> 07:04.577
the third step?

07:04.579 --> 07:06.329
We're never gonna be able
to get there

07:06.330 --> 07:08.080
if we have to sneak contraband
past these high-end scanners.

07:08.082 --> 07:09.247
I mean, how does that happen?

07:09.249 --> 07:10.514
We're gonna get Paige pregnant.

07:10.516 --> 07:12.215
What?!

07:12.217 --> 07:14.650
WALTER: <i> We'll hide what we
need</i> <i> in Paige's fake stomach.</i>

07:14.652 --> 07:17.519
PAIGE: <i> Hold on. Won't the
scanner</i> <i> see through my belly?</i>

07:17.521 --> 07:21.222
HAPPY: <i> Not if I'm underground
in an electrical conduit tunnel.</i>

07:21.224 --> 07:22.740
Step forward.

07:22.741 --> 07:24.257
HAPPY:
<i> A few crossed wires,</i>

07:24.260 --> 07:26.693
<i> I short out the scanners</i>
<i> with a power surge.</i>

07:26.695 --> 07:27.827
Happy now.

07:27.829 --> 07:30.262
(electrical pop,
electricity whirs down)

07:30.264 --> 07:32.430
Looks like we lost power.

07:32.432 --> 07:34.765
Ma'am, step
through, please.

07:36.468 --> 07:39.201
(electrical squeaking)

07:42.773 --> 07:44.539
(squeaking)
Okay.

07:44.541 --> 07:46.274
Go ahead.

07:47.577 --> 07:49.310
The last security layer is

07:49.312 --> 07:50.811
within international
jurisdiction.

07:50.813 --> 07:53.380
Before you can be
admitted to the UN proper,

07:53.382 --> 07:55.215
you've got to get past
a biometric

07:55.217 --> 07:57.217
hand reader.
It maps

07:57.219 --> 07:59.319
the individual web signature
of your palms.

07:59.321 --> 08:00.820
Everyone's is unique.

08:00.822 --> 08:02.188
How do they get past that?

08:02.190 --> 08:03.923
WALTER:
Any nation

08:03.924 --> 08:05.657
not sending delegates to
the conference? Italy.

08:05.660 --> 08:07.393
They've had trade issues
with Buritan

08:07.395 --> 08:10.295
and won't attend as a protest.
Perfect.

08:10.297 --> 08:11.296
HAPPY: Okay, I got a nice
clear shot of the paw.

08:11.298 --> 08:13.531
TOBY:
Laying over a color filter

08:13.533 --> 08:15.833
so blue deoxygenated veins
stand out.

08:15.835 --> 08:17.367
WALTER:
That is perfect.

08:17.369 --> 08:19.168
Toby, you sure
about your contact?

08:19.170 --> 08:20.769
He's a top medical
prosthetics researcher at NYU.

08:20.771 --> 08:23.238
More importantly, he's a lousy
card player. He owes me.

08:23.240 --> 08:25.773
Hold on. I'm gonna be carrying
fake hands in my stomach?

08:25.775 --> 08:28.242
TOBY: <i> And we're gonna
slip</i> <i> those fake hands on</i>

08:28.244 --> 08:30.277
<i> and use them to go</i>
<i> right through the scanners.</i>

08:30.279 --> 08:32.212
(indistinct chatter)

08:32.214 --> 08:35.315
Congratulations, Ms. Dineen.
It's quadruplets.

08:35.317 --> 08:37.183
PAIGE: <i> Won't people know what
the</i> <i> Italian delegates look like?</i>

08:37.185 --> 08:39.385
WALTER: <i> Well, members of
the General Assembly, yes.</i>

08:39.387 --> 08:41.186
<i> But security guards see</i>
<i> thousands of people pass there</i>

08:41.188 --> 08:43.188
<i> a week. They're just looking</i>
<i> for a green light.</i>

08:43.190 --> 08:45.156
(beep)

08:45.158 --> 08:46.557
Where do I fit
in this plan?

08:46.559 --> 08:48.292
You'll be with me, Professor.

08:48.294 --> 08:49.860
Now, the city's
electrical grid runs

08:49.862 --> 08:53.763
<i> 8X RMC conduit to insure that</i>
<i> the UN meets energy demands.</i>

08:53.765 --> 08:55.731
<i> The tunnels to support</i>
<i> that kind of work</i>

08:55.733 --> 08:57.466
<i> have to be right</i>
<i> under the building.</i>

08:57.468 --> 08:58.800
<i> And there are access panels</i>

08:58.802 --> 09:00.835
<i> to the UN's basement</i>
<i> for electrical workers.</i>

09:00.837 --> 09:03.804
<i> It's locked from the inside,</i>
<i> but our team will let us in.</i>

09:03.806 --> 09:05.238
(door squeaking)

09:05.240 --> 09:06.706
Man, it stinks down there.

09:06.708 --> 09:08.340
WALTER:
Well, the UN was built

09:08.342 --> 09:11.309
over slaughterhouse dumps.
Those brass vents down there?

09:11.311 --> 09:12.643
They're slow-releasing
decades-old methane pockets.

09:12.645 --> 09:14.645
That, or Cabe had jerky
on the plane again.

09:14.647 --> 09:16.413
MAN: Hands up! Turn around!
(gun chamber clicks)

09:16.415 --> 09:17.647
Who are you?!
What are you doing here?!

09:17.649 --> 09:19.482
Take it easy.
We're electricians.

09:19.484 --> 09:20.616
We're doing
an inspection.

09:20.618 --> 09:22.234
More importantly,
who are you,

09:22.235 --> 09:23.851
and what are you doing
down here with a gun no less?

09:23.854 --> 09:25.854
I'm a security guard
for Ambassador Madaky.

09:25.856 --> 09:28.857
Stationed here in case
anyone tries to harm him.

09:28.859 --> 09:33.894
(grunting, blows landing)

09:36.531 --> 09:37.596
What language was that?

09:37.598 --> 09:38.496
What going on, Gleason?

09:38.498 --> 09:40.231
As you've probably deduced,

09:40.233 --> 09:42.733
I'm not here
to translate anything.

09:42.735 --> 09:43.800
Bollocks, his accent switched

09:43.802 --> 09:45.568
from Colin Firth
to Michael Caine.

09:45.570 --> 09:47.236
Is anything about you real?
Yes.

09:47.238 --> 09:48.937
My conviction.

09:48.939 --> 09:51.973
I'm here to assassinate
Ambassador Jonas Madaky.

09:51.975 --> 09:53.774
And all of you

09:53.776 --> 09:55.742
are gonna help me.

10:08.656 --> 10:10.822
Seriously, Doc? You couldn't
read that this guy was crooked?

10:10.824 --> 10:12.590
MI6 is trained
to not be readable.

10:12.592 --> 10:15.492
It's like the CIA,
but with crumpets.

10:15.494 --> 10:16.693
All right now, close the door.

10:16.695 --> 10:19.328
(door squeaking shut)

10:19.330 --> 10:20.429
CROMWELL:
Gleason?

10:20.431 --> 10:21.663
What's your status?

10:21.665 --> 10:22.998
Well, we ran into one

10:22.999 --> 10:24.332
of Madaky's men,
but he was dispatched.

10:24.334 --> 10:26.734
Scorpion has been advised
of the new arrangement.

10:26.736 --> 10:28.469
What new arrangement?
HAPPY: Arrangement of

10:28.471 --> 10:29.536
them screwing us.

10:29.538 --> 10:31.437
I'm sorry, Deputy Director,

10:31.439 --> 10:33.405
but Madaky is just
too valuable a target

10:33.407 --> 10:35.740
for us to let
this opportunity pass by.

10:35.742 --> 10:37.274
CABE:
They want us to help

10:37.276 --> 10:38.842
assassinate him, Katherine.

10:38.844 --> 10:42.612
Cromwell, this mission
of yours ends now.

10:42.614 --> 10:43.813
Need I remind you,

10:43.815 --> 10:45.014
you are on U.S. soil.

10:45.016 --> 10:46.448
Indeed.

10:46.450 --> 10:48.016
But they're
on international soil.

10:48.018 --> 10:49.484
And your team is on film

10:49.486 --> 10:52.453
entering the UN
under false pretenses.

10:52.455 --> 10:54.822
So it's a matter of time
before they're identified.

10:54.824 --> 10:56.890
And then they will be arrested
and tried for murder

10:56.892 --> 10:58.258
in the International Court

10:58.260 --> 10:59.626
in the Netherlands.

10:59.628 --> 11:01.427
I don't know who you think
you're working with,

11:01.429 --> 11:02.694
but we're not killers.

11:02.696 --> 11:04.829
I know exactly who
I'm working with.

11:04.831 --> 11:06.697
Now, I don't want
to strong-arm you,

11:06.699 --> 11:07.964
but I have orders to forbid you

11:07.966 --> 11:09.565
to walk away from this.

11:12.703 --> 11:13.968
You played me

11:13.970 --> 11:15.703
from our first meeting.

11:15.705 --> 11:17.404
What choice did I have?

11:17.406 --> 11:18.805
Your team
would never have agreed to this

11:18.807 --> 11:20.873
unless they were painted
into a corner.

11:20.875 --> 11:23.542
Now, it may be distasteful,

11:23.544 --> 11:27.012
but I am willing to trade my
ethics for Madaky's heartbeat.

11:27.014 --> 11:29.381
Please don't underestimate
what I'm willing to do

11:29.383 --> 11:32.950
to see this happen. Don't
make me send you to prison.

11:35.721 --> 11:38.621
We have no choice.

11:39.557 --> 11:41.690
I'm glad you see it our way.

11:41.692 --> 11:44.426
Now, I suggest we find

11:44.428 --> 11:46.761
a secluded conference room
upstairs,

11:46.763 --> 11:49.363
and I'll fill you all in.

11:52.935 --> 11:56.069
<i> Since I'm MI6,</i>
<i> you follow my lead.</i>

11:56.071 --> 11:57.904
MI6, MI6.

11:57.906 --> 11:59.505
Big deal. They're
barely better than MI5,

11:59.507 --> 12:00.806
and they're half
as good as MI12.

12:00.808 --> 12:02.707
Chief Cromwell, are we connected?
Yes.

12:02.709 --> 12:04.809
Are you in a secure location?
WALTER: Secure for now.

12:04.811 --> 12:06.010
But every moment that we're here
increases our chances

12:06.012 --> 12:07.011
of being caught.

12:07.013 --> 12:08.812
So I suggest
that you present

12:08.814 --> 12:11.080
your plan, and we will advise
if we can help.

12:11.082 --> 12:13.082
Directness appreciated.

12:13.084 --> 12:15.918
Our intel believes that Madaky
and Ali will make their deal

12:15.920 --> 12:18.720
on the 15th floor
in a locked meeting room.

12:18.722 --> 12:21.556
Now, these rooms have no
cameras for confidentiality,

12:21.558 --> 12:24.358
and no one will be there
save for Madaky, Ali,

12:24.360 --> 12:26.626
and some of their men.
So when bullets fly,

12:26.628 --> 12:28.278
no innocents will get hurt.

12:28.279 --> 12:29.929
I enter with my head
down so hallway cameras

12:29.931 --> 12:31.797
can't read my face,

12:31.799 --> 12:34.833
dispose of my target, and exit.

12:34.835 --> 12:36.935
Sounds like you've got it
figured out. Why do you need us?

12:36.937 --> 12:38.937
Remember how we said
Madaky liked to travel

12:38.939 --> 12:41.372
with personal security
accoutrements?

12:41.374 --> 12:42.940
One of these
is a high-level

12:42.942 --> 12:45.676
security door he has
his advance team install.

12:45.678 --> 12:47.811
Now, I need you to hack
the computerized lock

12:47.813 --> 12:51.481
so I can enter that meeting room
with an element of surprise.

12:51.483 --> 12:52.882
And I need you to hurry.

12:52.884 --> 12:55.918
Madaky speaks before
the General Assembly

12:55.920 --> 12:58.520
in an hour, and we're certain
he's gonna want to get back

12:58.522 --> 13:00.955
to Africa as soon as possible.
He won't dally.

13:00.957 --> 13:02.923
There's a good chance
his meeting with Ali

13:02.925 --> 13:05.525
is taking place right now.

13:15.469 --> 13:17.402
Walter, what are you doing?

13:17.404 --> 13:19.804
Hacking into Madaky's laptop.
The odds are the software

13:19.806 --> 13:21.939
that programs his door lock
is on it.

13:21.941 --> 13:25.142
You're really gonna help kill a man?
No. I'm gonna help open a door,

13:25.144 --> 13:26.977
and then we get the hell out
of here. Whatever Gleason does

13:26.979 --> 13:28.611
after that
is his responsibility.

13:28.613 --> 13:29.678
TOBY: That's a moral
rationalization

13:29.680 --> 13:31.112
if I ever heard one.

13:31.114 --> 13:32.480
Do you want to get locked up
overseas?

13:34.984 --> 13:35.983
Do you want to see Ralph again?

13:38.754 --> 13:40.787
Then let me work.

13:40.789 --> 13:42.555
(indistinct chatter)

13:44.492 --> 13:45.824
(moans softly)

13:45.826 --> 13:48.593
Hey.

13:48.595 --> 13:50.828
Hey, you're awake.

13:51.797 --> 13:53.596
(hoarsely):
Water.

13:53.598 --> 13:55.064
Water. Yes.

13:55.066 --> 13:58.067
Remember, you have
to take small sips.

14:07.410 --> 14:10.477
Please...

14:11.413 --> 14:14.480
...Sylvester...

14:15.416 --> 14:18.750
...never again.

14:18.752 --> 14:21.718
The intubation?

14:23.688 --> 14:27.089
Megan, Walter has a court order.

14:27.091 --> 14:29.925
Please...

14:30.894 --> 14:33.627
Okay.

14:36.498 --> 14:39.499
I'll find a way.

14:39.501 --> 14:40.733
Have you
found a way?

14:40.735 --> 14:41.734
I'm into his system.
Well,

14:41.736 --> 14:43.102
hurry up!
Shouting at me

14:43.103 --> 14:44.469
and waving your gun
does not help.

14:50.744 --> 14:52.877
O-kay, this is bad.

14:52.879 --> 14:54.712
Gleason, you need to see this.

14:54.714 --> 14:55.746
CROMWELL:
What? What is it?

14:55.748 --> 14:56.913
What did he find?

14:58.883 --> 14:59.848
Is this for real?

14:59.850 --> 15:00.782
I'm afraid so.

15:02.652 --> 15:04.852
Not good.
I asked you a question, Gleason.

15:04.854 --> 15:05.986
What's the problem?

15:05.988 --> 15:07.487
I can't unlock the door.

15:07.489 --> 15:09.155
What do you mean
you can't unlock the door?

15:09.157 --> 15:11.090
Can you hear me?

15:11.092 --> 15:13.759
Why can't you unlock the door?
Madaky's door lock

15:13.761 --> 15:15.894
is air-gapped. But there is
a stand-alone keypad

15:15.896 --> 15:18.496
that connects to the interior
of the door via Ethernet cable.

15:18.498 --> 15:19.480
You punch a password

15:19.481 --> 15:20.463
directly into it
to open the door.

15:20.466 --> 15:21.832
Gleason?

15:21.834 --> 15:24.234
Yeah, he's telling the truth.

15:24.236 --> 15:26.502
I saw the specs myself.

15:26.504 --> 15:27.936
HAPPY:
Uh, guys,

15:27.938 --> 15:28.970
things just
got worse.

15:28.972 --> 15:30.171
I've hacked the security cameras

15:30.173 --> 15:31.906
on the 15th floor hallway.

15:31.908 --> 15:33.040
Look.

15:34.009 --> 15:36.075
CABE: All right,
the deal's done.

15:36.077 --> 15:38.577
We're too late. We got to go
before we get busted.

15:38.579 --> 15:40.145
Like hell it's too late.

15:40.147 --> 15:41.680
My team has done what it could.

15:41.681 --> 15:43.214
I'm under direct orders
from Downing Street

15:43.216 --> 15:46.083
to do whatever is necessary
to complete my objective.

15:46.085 --> 15:48.151
Now, if that means locking
your entire team up

15:48.153 --> 15:50.052
and throwing away the key,
then that is what I will do.

15:50.054 --> 15:52.788
I'm sorry,
Deputy Director.

15:52.790 --> 15:54.122
This is not personal.

15:54.124 --> 15:56.056
I am simply doing my duty.

15:58.860 --> 16:00.759
I'm gonna find a bathroom.

16:00.761 --> 16:02.260
I think I'm gonna be sick.

16:03.863 --> 16:05.662
Okay. We've got to come up
with a new idea.

16:05.664 --> 16:07.864
I recall from the blueprints
that the seventh floor

16:07.866 --> 16:09.232
is nothing but HVAC,

16:09.234 --> 16:10.866
electrical, and plumbing.
There's no surveillance.

16:10.868 --> 16:13.101
Gleason can do the hit there.

16:13.103 --> 16:15.236
Except Madaky's speech
is in less than an hour.

16:15.238 --> 16:17.538
He's probably on his way
to the green room to wait

16:17.540 --> 16:19.873
his turn to speak. He won't stop
on the seventh floor.

16:19.875 --> 16:21.140
Like hell he won't.

16:21.142 --> 16:23.942
Over here!

16:23.944 --> 16:25.543
This is crazy
that we're doing this, right?

16:25.545 --> 16:27.878
Well, psychologically speaking,
"crazy" is a catchall

16:27.880 --> 16:29.746
for a myriad of pathologies
and circumstances,

16:29.748 --> 16:31.047
but, yeah, this is nuttier
than a fruitcake.

16:31.049 --> 16:32.915
Okay, Walt, I've got control
of the elevator.

16:32.917 --> 16:34.182
Just tell me when.
Okay.

16:34.184 --> 16:36.184
They just stepped
onto the elevator.

16:45.561 --> 16:47.060
I'll stand by here

16:47.062 --> 16:48.761
in case Madaky gets past you.

16:50.064 --> 16:52.664
All right, Walter,
I know this is a last resort,

16:52.666 --> 16:54.198
but it's gonna be over soon.

16:55.634 --> 16:57.700
PAIGE: He's almost on
the seventh floor.

16:57.702 --> 17:00.802
Are you sure you can do this?
Uh, no. Okay, Happy, now.

17:03.106 --> 17:04.738
What the hell?

17:08.276 --> 17:11.176
Okay, I flip the switch
and then we hustle. Ready?

17:11.778 --> 17:13.144
Go!

17:13.146 --> 17:15.813
(elevator dings, bell rings)

17:15.815 --> 17:17.314
O'Brien, it's stuck.
Yeah, I know.

17:17.316 --> 17:18.982
There's a slight glitch.

17:24.021 --> 17:26.154
(gunshots)

17:28.658 --> 17:30.057
(gunshots)

17:31.160 --> 17:32.692
Okay. Got
the doors open.

17:32.694 --> 17:33.225
(elevator dings)

17:35.562 --> 17:37.294
(grunting)

17:39.998 --> 17:43.065
(shouts, groans)

17:43.067 --> 17:45.734
(grunting)

17:57.780 --> 17:59.713
(gunshots)

17:59.715 --> 18:01.781
(grunts)

18:07.221 --> 18:09.087
(panting)

18:10.356 --> 18:11.955
I'll check him for an I.D.

18:11.957 --> 18:13.957
This isn't the first
attempt on my life.

18:13.959 --> 18:15.725
Assassins do not carry I.D.

18:15.727 --> 18:17.226
I will contact
the General Assembly,

18:17.228 --> 18:20.062
tell them there is a threat
and we are leaving immediately.

18:20.064 --> 18:23.065
You'll do no such thing! Word gets out
there's been an attempt on my life,

18:23.067 --> 18:24.099
it brings attention.

18:24.101 --> 18:25.767
People I do
business with

18:25.769 --> 18:27.101
do not like attention.

18:27.103 --> 18:29.069
I will address the
General Assembly

18:29.071 --> 18:31.738
as scheduled.
Then we will leave.

18:31.740 --> 18:35.174
I will let nothing jeopardize
my deal with Ali.

18:35.176 --> 18:36.708
What about him?

18:39.312 --> 18:41.145
Toss him in there.

18:48.286 --> 18:49.818
CROMWELL:
What's happening?

18:49.820 --> 18:50.952
I need an update.

18:58.227 --> 19:01.294
Tell Cromwell
that Madaky's still alive.

19:03.331 --> 19:04.930
Gleason's dead.

19:04.932 --> 19:07.698
They just put his body
down the incinerator.

19:10.269 --> 19:12.202
(sighs) I'm sorry about the elevator.
It was my fault.

19:12.204 --> 19:15.271
There could've been some tics in my wiring.
CROMWELL: It doesn't matter

19:15.273 --> 19:16.905
whose fault it was.

19:16.907 --> 19:19.874
Gleason was a top agent
and a good man,

19:19.876 --> 19:21.876
murdered by a bastard.

19:21.878 --> 19:23.244
You just lost your assassin.

19:23.246 --> 19:25.112
My team

19:25.114 --> 19:27.647
is in jeopardy just being
in that building. I need

19:27.649 --> 19:29.682
to pull them out now. No,
we're finishing  the job.

19:29.684 --> 19:31.984
We're doing what now?
Yeah, I'm pretty sure

19:31.985 --> 19:34.285
we can convince the mean British
lady not to send us to jail. No.

19:34.288 --> 19:37.355
Madaky just threw a human being
down an incinerator shoot

19:37.357 --> 19:38.756
like he was garbage.

19:38.758 --> 19:40.290
This is a man
who supports

19:40.292 --> 19:42.008
mass killings and genocide,
and, what,

19:42.009 --> 19:43.725
we're just gonna let him go free
to do it some more?

19:43.728 --> 19:46.061
We're not MI6 or the CIA.
Yeah,

19:46.063 --> 19:47.295
we're geeks.
What is

19:47.297 --> 19:48.863
the point in us having
these abilities

19:48.865 --> 19:50.297
if we don't use
them to stop

19:50.299 --> 19:51.398
what's bad in the world?

19:51.400 --> 19:53.133
Greater good. But, Walter,

19:53.135 --> 19:54.667
you are not a murderer.
This is  not

19:54.669 --> 19:56.802
murder-- this is self-defense.

19:58.005 --> 19:59.304
We're protecting the world.

19:59.306 --> 20:00.905
Now,
Madaky

20:00.907 --> 20:03.307
is scheduled to give his speech
in 14 minutes.

20:03.309 --> 20:05.442
He's probably already down
in the green room.

20:05.444 --> 20:07.444
Once he gives that speech,
he's gone.

20:09.214 --> 20:11.948
I have an idea
how to take Madaky out,

20:11.950 --> 20:13.849
if we're all in.

20:19.089 --> 20:20.955
I can't believe I'm doing this,

20:20.957 --> 20:22.957
but that was
a pretty rousing speech.

20:22.959 --> 20:24.925
We're a team, so yeah.

20:24.927 --> 20:28.295
I hope you know what you're doing.
I do.

20:28.297 --> 20:31.264
But my plan depends on Happy
finding hard salami casings

20:31.266 --> 20:34.100
down in the commissary.
Salami casings?

20:34.102 --> 20:36.135
They contain potassium nitrate.

20:37.238 --> 20:39.438
They're making a bomb.
Not a bomb. A small,

20:39.440 --> 20:41.239
directionally designed charge.

20:41.241 --> 20:43.241
Just enough to take Madaky out

20:43.242 --> 20:45.242
without causing serious damage
to anyone around him.

20:45.245 --> 20:46.978
You thinking his briefcase?
Exactly.

20:46.980 --> 20:48.713
Now, we'll swap his laptop
for a charge

20:48.715 --> 20:50.715
of almost identical dimensions
and size

20:50.717 --> 20:52.750
so that he will not feel
the change in weight.

20:52.752 --> 20:53.951
Leave that to me. Doc,
can you meet me backstage

20:53.953 --> 20:55.852
at the General Assembly
in five minutes?

20:55.854 --> 20:56.919
Copy that.

20:56.921 --> 20:58.320
Walter, can you manipulate

20:58.322 --> 21:00.855
temperature controls in here
from your laptop?

21:00.857 --> 21:02.423
I've controlled satellites
from this computer before.

21:02.425 --> 21:04.391
I can handle a thermostat.
Okay, crank  the heat

21:04.393 --> 21:07.327
by the southwest Security Check
on the second floor.

21:08.396 --> 21:09.895
Paige, you come with me.

21:09.897 --> 21:12.764
♪ ♪

21:19.072 --> 21:20.438
Oh, yes.

21:22.475 --> 21:24.408
Happy, you almost done?

21:24.410 --> 21:25.960
I'm sorry I'm not making a bomb

21:25.961 --> 21:27.511
out of salami fast enough
for you.

21:27.513 --> 21:28.845
Actually, you're not.

21:28.847 --> 21:29.846
Madaky goes on right after

21:29.848 --> 21:31.113
the Polish delegate's speech,

21:31.115 --> 21:32.914
and that guy's up next.

21:32.916 --> 21:35.483
Yeah, well, let's hope Cabe's
stall tactic works then. Yeah.

21:35.485 --> 21:37.885
I'm working on that right now.

21:37.887 --> 21:39.486
(indistinct chatter)

21:39.488 --> 21:41.321
Damn thing's busted.

21:41.323 --> 21:43.790
<i> Scusa.</i>

21:43.792 --> 21:45.324
<i> Come si dice...</i>

21:45.326 --> 21:48.126
(Italian accent): Uh, I lost my watch.
My wristwatch.

21:48.128 --> 21:49.961
Oh. Okay, sir.
What you want to do

21:49.963 --> 21:51.429
is you want to go
to the Lost and Found.

21:51.431 --> 21:53.364
It's at the Visitors
Desk on the first floor.

21:53.366 --> 21:56.433
<i> Grazie,</i>
<i> grazie, grazie.</i>

21:56.435 --> 21:59.369
Mr. President,
ministers, your excellencies,

21:59.371 --> 22:02.872
and ladies and gentlemen, it is my honor
to welcome you... (speaking Polish)

22:10.914 --> 22:13.447
Excuse me, ma'am,
you're needed

22:13.449 --> 22:15.816
to translate over at
the security council meeting

22:15.818 --> 22:17.117
at the conference building.

22:17.119 --> 22:19.018
But I was assigned here.
Understood,

22:19.020 --> 22:22.354
but the translator dropped out
and we want a senior linguist

22:22.356 --> 22:24.389
to handle the meeting.
A replacement

22:24.391 --> 22:26.457
will be sent
to the Polish delegate shortly.

22:26.459 --> 22:28.525
Okay, if you say so.

22:33.898 --> 22:35.297
Sir.

22:37.000 --> 22:38.899
(line ringing) You're up, doc.
Drag it out.

22:38.901 --> 22:40.100
This is Ray.

22:40.102 --> 22:41.301
Hello, Ray. It's Toby.

22:41.303 --> 22:42.468
Hey, doc.

22:42.470 --> 22:43.669
What's happenin', cap'n?

22:43.670 --> 22:44.869
Your last name's Spiewack,
right? Is that Polish?

22:44.872 --> 22:46.504
As Polish as a bratwurst.

22:46.506 --> 22:49.006
That's German, dummy. Look,
do you know any Polish at all?

22:49.008 --> 22:50.841
I was raised
by my Grandma Etoile.

22:50.843 --> 22:52.826
And that's French.

22:52.827 --> 22:54.810
Look, we're on a case
and we're in a bit of a bind.

22:54.813 --> 22:56.212
You're gonna hear some people in
the background speaking Polish.

22:56.214 --> 22:58.180
I got my phone
linked into my comm.

22:58.182 --> 23:00.015
I'm gonna need you to translate
it back to me in English.

23:00.017 --> 23:01.249
<i> De nada, amigo.</i>

23:01.251 --> 23:02.634
Now we have Spanish.

23:02.635 --> 23:04.018
Remind me to punch you
when we get back.

23:04.020 --> 23:05.452
MODERATOR:
Thank you, Ambassador Daroolay.

23:05.454 --> 23:08.188
Now speaking, Ambassador
Marik Kaluza of Poland.

23:08.190 --> 23:09.489
Okay, Ray, we're on.

23:09.491 --> 23:11.557
Okay.

23:13.527 --> 23:15.260
Been a while
since I've spoken Polish.

23:15.262 --> 23:18.162
(speaks Polish)

23:18.164 --> 23:21.865
(speaks Polish)

23:32.944 --> 23:35.110
Cabe, I can only
delay this for so long.

23:35.112 --> 23:36.911
CABE:
Just do what you always do--

23:36.913 --> 23:38.178
refuse to shut up.

23:40.482 --> 23:43.216
(speaking Polish)

23:44.986 --> 23:48.487
RAY: Um, uh...
distinguished, uh, people...

23:48.489 --> 23:50.956
members of the General Assembly.
Wait,

23:50.958 --> 23:52.958
hold on a second-- holy cow,
are you at the UN?

23:52.960 --> 23:54.960
Distinguished members

23:54.962 --> 23:57.228
of the General Assembly,

23:57.230 --> 23:59.563
what a privilege
and an honor it is

23:59.565 --> 24:01.097
to speak to you today

24:01.099 --> 24:04.100
in this great institution

24:04.102 --> 24:07.569
that-that is the United Nations.

24:09.306 --> 24:12.040
Bomb's ready. Three types
of cleaning solution,

24:12.042 --> 24:15.009
two pounds of salami parts
and one baking tin.

24:15.011 --> 24:16.944
I am done.
Paige, you are up.

24:16.946 --> 24:19.012
Roger that.

24:23.651 --> 24:25.917
Hi.

24:28.187 --> 24:30.020
Who are you?
Makeup.

24:30.022 --> 24:31.054
For your speech.

24:31.056 --> 24:32.388
I don't need makeup.
The UN

24:32.390 --> 24:34.423
is recording today's session
for their archives.

24:34.425 --> 24:36.391
Uh, they have new lights
over the stage--

24:36.393 --> 24:38.460
makes everyone shiny.

24:38.461 --> 24:40.528
Please, I get in trouble
if I don't do my job.

24:40.530 --> 24:42.396
And we can't have
the most handsome delegate

24:42.398 --> 24:44.530
not looking his best.

24:47.034 --> 24:50.101
Okay, come.

24:50.103 --> 24:52.036
Do what you do.
Great,

24:52.038 --> 24:54.638
I'll just get my stuff
and get to it.

25:02.446 --> 25:04.078
Happy. How's it look?

25:04.080 --> 25:06.246
Like a TV dinner
that goes boom.

25:06.248 --> 25:09.215
Good work.
Someone

25:09.217 --> 25:10.649
fill me in, please.
On our way

25:10.651 --> 25:12.617
to the green room
with the completed bomb.

25:12.619 --> 25:14.952
It runs via chemical-
kinetic reaction,

25:14.954 --> 25:17.254
so once I shake it up,
we have 15 minutes

25:17.256 --> 25:20.156
until it detonates. Okay, well, you
better get it in that green room

25:20.158 --> 25:21.690
before Madaky leaves,
because otherwise

25:21.692 --> 25:23.191
you lose your only opportunity.

25:23.193 --> 25:25.359
And I'm not sure
this Polish delegate's speech

25:25.361 --> 25:27.627
can be dragged out much further.

25:27.629 --> 25:29.295
(speaking Polish)

25:34.301 --> 25:36.701
RAY:
Okay, uh, at this point,

25:36.703 --> 25:38.235
I would like to talk about

25:38.237 --> 25:40.704
the United Nations Children's...

25:40.706 --> 25:42.605
Fund?

25:42.607 --> 25:45.207
At this point,
I would like to talk about

25:45.209 --> 25:49.144
the United Nations
Children's Fund, because

25:49.146 --> 25:51.713
when you think about it,

25:51.715 --> 25:54.682
children really are the future.

25:54.684 --> 25:57.518
I say, teach 'em well,

25:57.520 --> 26:00.287
let them lead the way.

26:00.289 --> 26:01.621
HAPPY:
We need more time, doc.

26:01.623 --> 26:03.990
Actually, children
often don't know

26:03.992 --> 26:05.124
where they're going.

26:05.126 --> 26:07.392
Because the hippocampus

26:07.394 --> 26:10.695
isn't fully developed
un-until you're much older.

26:10.697 --> 26:12.963
That-that's what controls
your sense of direction.

26:16.702 --> 26:18.101
Go ahead.

26:18.103 --> 26:20.570
Okay, almost done, except

26:20.572 --> 26:22.638
I'm out of concealer.
Just be a minute.

26:22.640 --> 26:25.240
I'm gonna have
my assistant Ursula

26:25.242 --> 26:26.741
come bring me what I need.

26:26.743 --> 26:28.275
(phone dings)

26:28.277 --> 26:30.377
"Ursula, bring me concealer."

26:30.379 --> 26:32.245
Huh.
I don't look like an Ursula.

26:32.247 --> 26:34.347
Okay, this is it.
You ready?

26:34.349 --> 26:37.183
No.
Too bad.

26:37.185 --> 26:39.318
Reaction's begun.

26:39.320 --> 26:41.119
And you're giving it to me.
Yeah, and you better hurry,

26:41.121 --> 26:43.187
because in less than 15
minutes, that bomb goes off.

26:43.189 --> 26:44.388
Unless, of course,
the reaction accelerates,

26:44.390 --> 26:45.655
and then you have a lot less.

26:45.657 --> 26:47.623
And I get to hold it.
Fantastic.

26:53.163 --> 26:55.496
You know, the light is terrible.
Do you mind moving over there?

26:55.498 --> 26:57.464
Fine. Make it quick.

26:57.466 --> 26:59.532
Okay.

27:07.508 --> 27:09.007
Ursula.

27:09.009 --> 27:10.541
Finally. If you can't
work faster,

27:10.543 --> 27:12.209
you can't work for me.

27:12.211 --> 27:14.311
Sorry, ma'am.

27:14.313 --> 27:16.012
Here, put this base back
in my bag and go help

27:16.014 --> 27:18.380
with the Norwegians on the third
floor. Give them some color.

27:20.684 --> 27:23.184
(Madaky clears throat)

27:23.186 --> 27:25.352
BODYGUARD: This Polish
delegate is an idiot.

27:34.496 --> 27:36.062
Okay, I'll be
right upstairs, boss.

27:36.064 --> 27:37.196
Whatever.

27:42.169 --> 27:44.569
This kind of thing we're doing
isn't exactly our style.

27:44.571 --> 27:46.137
You sure about all this?
Yeah.

27:46.139 --> 27:48.038
I'll be fine.
Headed to the basement now.

27:48.040 --> 27:49.339
You get into position
and wait for Paige.

27:49.341 --> 27:50.673
Things are about to get crazy.

27:50.675 --> 27:52.675
We passed crazy a long time ago.

27:52.677 --> 27:54.576
Okay.

27:54.578 --> 27:56.377
I thank the Assembly
for their time today

27:56.379 --> 27:58.312
and, uh, their attention

27:58.314 --> 28:02.049
to-to this important platter.
Matter.

28:02.051 --> 28:04.051
It's not platter. Tob...

28:04.053 --> 28:07.521
I thank the Assembly
for their time today

28:07.523 --> 28:11.191
and attention
to this important matter.

28:11.193 --> 28:13.726
And I would like to take this
moment

28:13.728 --> 28:16.595
to address the unfair percentage

28:16.597 --> 28:19.731
of ethnic jokes
directed to the Polish people.

28:19.733 --> 28:21.132
For the record,

28:21.134 --> 28:24.135
we have the formula
for ice cubes

28:24.137 --> 28:26.837
and it takes only one of us
to screw in a light bulb.

28:31.709 --> 28:33.058
(whispers):
Thank God.

28:33.059 --> 28:34.408
That's all. Thank
you for your time.

28:34.411 --> 28:36.344
Don't forget to
tip your waiters.

28:38.414 --> 28:39.846
MODERATOR:
Thank you, Ambassador Kaluza.

28:39.848 --> 28:41.848
Speaking next,
Ambassador Jonas Madaky

28:41.850 --> 28:44.116
of Buritan.
(applause)

28:50.624 --> 28:52.690
(clears throat)

28:55.628 --> 28:58.195
Members of the General Assembly,
it is an honor

28:58.197 --> 29:00.363
to speak to you today
on the subject

29:00.365 --> 29:03.799
of the continuing crisis
in Buritan.

29:03.801 --> 29:04.833
Sorry I'm late.

29:04.835 --> 29:06.534
Toby had me tied up with a case.

29:06.536 --> 29:07.668
You know how it is
with Scorpion.

29:07.670 --> 29:09.703
Did you grab what we need?
I am so sorry.

29:09.705 --> 29:12.672
I couldn't get it on such
short notice, but I did

29:12.674 --> 29:14.607
grab a couple Band-Aids.

29:16.644 --> 29:18.543
You guys ready?
Well...

29:18.545 --> 29:20.344
let's burn this bacon.

29:20.346 --> 29:22.679
According to my calculations,
we should have detonation

29:22.681 --> 29:26.215
in approximately
five, four, three...

29:26.217 --> 29:27.816
...two, one.

29:27.818 --> 29:29.751
Good-bye, Jonas.

29:29.752 --> 29:31.685
And now, with the civil war
in Tesopo

29:31.688 --> 29:33.187
driving hundreds of thousands
of refugees...

29:33.189 --> 29:35.189
What the hell happened, O'Brien?
I assume

29:35.191 --> 29:36.790
not enough potassium nitrate
in the salami rind

29:36.792 --> 29:38.224
to set off a reaction.

29:38.226 --> 29:40.125
But I have a backup,
we'll get Madaky

29:40.127 --> 29:41.559
before he leaves the building.

29:41.561 --> 29:43.427
MADAKY:
As you well know...

29:43.429 --> 29:44.728
Where are you going?

29:44.730 --> 29:47.330
I'm sorry, Katherine.

29:47.332 --> 29:49.516
I'm going
to arrange a car.

29:49.517 --> 29:51.701
I have to personally detain them
if they fail in this mission.

29:51.703 --> 29:53.402
Sending financial aid

29:53.404 --> 29:56.371
to Buritan is not just
a political necessity,

29:56.373 --> 30:00.408
it is a moral responsibility.

30:00.410 --> 30:02.476
Thank you.

30:09.551 --> 30:12.451
Got eyes on him. They're in
the east stairwell headed toward

30:12.453 --> 30:13.718
Madaky's chopper on the roof.

30:13.720 --> 30:15.553
One of his men
is carrying his bag.

30:15.555 --> 30:19.490
Aah!

30:19.492 --> 30:21.258
MAN: B Team, move in.
Shoot to kill!

30:21.260 --> 30:22.892
Whoever tried to kill me before
must've sent more men.

30:22.894 --> 30:25.294
Secure the chopper!

30:25.296 --> 30:26.561
Head 'em off at the pass!

30:26.563 --> 30:28.362
We can't get to the helicopter.
Call the car.

30:28.364 --> 30:30.430
We'll meet in the garage.

30:30.432 --> 30:32.899
Head 'em off at the pass--
who are you, Roy Rogers?

30:34.402 --> 30:36.702
Oh, Happy was right--
it stinks down here.

30:36.704 --> 30:39.571
Okay, they're headed to the
northeast parking structure

30:39.573 --> 30:41.639
right above me.
Okay.

31:00.292 --> 31:02.392
One, two, three.

31:13.738 --> 31:14.737
They set explosives.

31:14.739 --> 31:16.205
We're under attack.

31:16.206 --> 31:17.672
Tell the driver to meet us by
the parking ramp

31:17.675 --> 31:19.307
on the east side
of the building.

31:19.309 --> 31:21.776
Now go!

31:21.778 --> 31:23.033
(sirens wail in distance)
Hear those fire trucks.

31:23.059 --> 31:23.944
They'll think it's
a gas line break.

31:23.946 --> 31:26.546
Walter's brilliance
still surprises me.

31:26.548 --> 31:27.813
Yeah, don't celebrate yet.

31:27.815 --> 31:29.314
We still don't know
if his plan'll work.

31:30.684 --> 31:31.849
Uh, we'll know soon enough.
You ready?

31:31.851 --> 31:33.851
Light him up.

31:33.853 --> 31:35.853
(engine starts)

31:39.758 --> 31:40.957
Now.
(engine revving)

31:48.333 --> 31:49.765
Madaky.

31:54.938 --> 31:56.671
Hey, did you guys
see me on stage?

31:56.673 --> 31:57.938
I think I should
run for office.

31:57.940 --> 31:59.506
What do you mean
he's getting away?

31:59.508 --> 32:01.574
Madaky's limo's driving away,

32:01.576 --> 32:02.808
along the river.
We missed him.

32:02.810 --> 32:03.875
If you want
to catch him yourself

32:03.877 --> 32:04.976
then you better drive faster.

32:04.978 --> 32:06.310
TOBY:
Okay, guys, let's go.

32:07.780 --> 32:09.446
MADAKY:
<i> Hurry up!</i>

32:11.917 --> 32:13.583
There's a car following us.

32:15.019 --> 32:16.485
<i> What the hell are you doing?</i>

32:16.487 --> 32:17.719
Why are you stopping?

32:18.955 --> 32:20.854
Driver?

32:23.525 --> 32:26.259
Ambassador.
I saw you shot.

32:26.261 --> 32:27.827
I dumped your body.

32:27.829 --> 32:30.496
I'm a ghost. Boo.

32:35.969 --> 32:37.735
(tires screech)

32:40.039 --> 32:42.372
You're not going anywhere, pal.
Homeland Security.

32:42.374 --> 32:43.940
You're under arrest.
You can't arrest me.

32:43.942 --> 32:45.708
You have no
authority here.

32:45.710 --> 32:48.010
The UN is international soil!

32:48.012 --> 32:50.045
From the stairwell
to the explosion,

32:50.047 --> 32:52.914
we took out your guys,
manipulated you to our limo,

32:52.916 --> 32:54.715
and then drove you right here,

32:54.717 --> 32:57.284
20 feet over the federal line
of jurisdiction.

33:01.790 --> 33:03.757
Makeup girls.
You should have used

33:03.758 --> 33:05.725
more concealer-- maybe
we wouldn't have found you.

33:05.727 --> 33:07.359
Comedy really isn't your thing.

33:08.695 --> 33:10.060
(tires screech)

33:13.331 --> 33:14.763
Why is he still alive?

33:16.366 --> 33:17.865
Hello, boss.

33:17.867 --> 33:20.067
COOPER:
Why is<i> he</i> still alive?

33:20.069 --> 33:22.569
Someone fill me in<i> now. </i>
Gladly.

33:22.571 --> 33:24.871
But I think it's best
we let our Houdinis explain

33:24.873 --> 33:26.906
how they pulled off
their sleight-of-hand.

33:28.843 --> 33:30.909
For starters,
only the first three rounds

33:30.911 --> 33:32.877
in Gleason's gun were real.

33:32.879 --> 33:34.879
The rest were blanks,
made by Happy.

33:34.881 --> 33:37.615
<i> She simply removed</i>
<i>the lead bullet from the shell,</i>

33:37.617 --> 33:39.083
<i> leaving only powder</i>
<i> in the cartridge.</i>

33:41.821 --> 33:43.821
All the bang
with none of the death.

33:43.823 --> 33:45.389
Then all I had to do

33:45.391 --> 33:47.324
was excuse myself from
the conference room...

33:47.326 --> 33:50.727
I'm gonna find a bathroom--
I think I'm gonna be sick.

33:50.729 --> 33:52.495
<i> ...sneak to the kitchen...</i>

33:52.497 --> 33:54.964
<i> a little corn syrup, food</i>
<i> coloring-- instant bloodbath</i>

33:54.966 --> 33:56.598
<i> for under Gleason's shirt.</i>

33:56.600 --> 33:58.666
And I've beaten
Muay Thai masters in Bangkok,

33:58.668 --> 34:01.368
so making that fight go
exactly the way I wanted

34:01.370 --> 34:02.936
was a walk in the park.

34:02.938 --> 34:05.371
<i> I disarmed the guard</i>
<i> so the gun with blanks</i>

34:05.373 --> 34:07.806
(silenced gunshots)
<i> was the only one in play.</i>

34:07.808 --> 34:10.675
<i> Made him think</i>
<i> he'd shot me in the stomach</i>

34:10.677 --> 34:12.677
<i>after I directed the fisticuffs</i>

34:12.679 --> 34:14.779
<i> to right in front</i>
<i> of the incinerator chute.</i>

34:14.781 --> 34:16.814
First Tenet
of Behavioral Decision Making--

34:16.816 --> 34:18.916
when faced
with a rapid-panic scenario,

34:18.918 --> 34:21.718
the most convenient option
is always taken.

34:21.720 --> 34:23.553
I knew if you had
to dispose of the body

34:23.555 --> 34:25.421
you'd shove it
in the first barrel, closet

34:25.423 --> 34:26.789
or trash chute that you saw.

34:26.791 --> 34:28.590
HAPPY: And going down
the incinerator chute

34:28.592 --> 34:31.092
doesn't necessarily mean
you end up in the incinerator.

34:31.094 --> 34:34.562
Okay, I flip the switch
and then we hustle. Ready?

34:34.564 --> 34:35.996
Go!

34:43.871 --> 34:45.937
(grunting)

34:45.939 --> 34:47.872
GLEASON:
Whoa... oh!

34:47.874 --> 34:50.074
(groans) You couldn't
have found anything softer

34:50.076 --> 34:51.942
to break my fall?

34:51.944 --> 34:54.377
Since murder isn't covered
under diplomatic immunity,

34:54.379 --> 34:55.978
you're out of luck, Ambassador,

34:55.980 --> 34:58.747
because I've captured it all
right here on tape.

34:58.749 --> 35:00.148
Digital.
Shut up.

35:07.123 --> 35:09.523
But he isn't
really dead.

35:09.525 --> 35:11.091
No body, no homicide.

35:11.093 --> 35:13.626
Oh, there's physical
evidence down there,

35:13.628 --> 35:15.494
enough to make a case.

35:15.496 --> 35:16.795
You cut off
your finger?

35:16.797 --> 35:18.396
HAPPY:
MI6 is

35:18.398 --> 35:19.797
so badass.  MADAKY:  Fine.

35:19.799 --> 35:22.466
My army of lawyers will
get me out of here,

35:22.468 --> 35:24.434
and I'll pay mercenaries
to come into this country

35:24.436 --> 35:25.868
and track each of you down.

35:25.870 --> 35:27.870
Oh, not unless
making license plates

35:27.872 --> 35:30.505
pays a lot more
than I think it does.

35:30.507 --> 35:32.173
<i> When we switched out</i>
<i> your laptop for the bomb--</i>

35:32.175 --> 35:34.074
<i> which was no more than</i>
<i> a homemade stun grenade</i>

35:34.076 --> 35:36.709
<i> on a timer meant to take out</i>
<i> one of your guards--</i>

35:36.711 --> 35:38.911
<i> I hacked into all</i>
<i> your encrypted bank accounts.</i>

35:38.913 --> 35:40.178
According to my calculations,

35:40.180 --> 35:41.979
we should have detonation

35:41.981 --> 35:44.881
in approximately five,
four, three,

35:44.883 --> 35:47.083
two, one.

35:47.085 --> 35:49.118
Your cupboards
are bare now, Madaky.

35:49.120 --> 35:51.653
But the good news is, all
your money has been donated

35:51.655 --> 35:54.022
to refugee charities
of war-torn nations

35:54.024 --> 35:55.857
that<i> you</i> decimated.

35:55.859 --> 35:57.191
So generous of you.

35:59.495 --> 36:00.894
Get this guy out of here.

36:00.896 --> 36:02.662
Who are you people?!

36:02.664 --> 36:06.132
Oh, we're the guys you
picked last in gym class.

36:06.134 --> 36:08.467
What about all these moralistic
debates about killing?

36:08.469 --> 36:09.701
WALTER: Cromwell
was listening

36:09.703 --> 36:10.868
on speaker.

36:10.870 --> 36:12.169
Didn't want her
to catch on,

36:12.171 --> 36:14.204
so... we acted.

36:14.206 --> 36:16.639
TOBY: Figured how
hard could it be

36:16.641 --> 36:17.906
if actors could do it?

36:17.908 --> 36:19.173
What about you,
Gleason?

36:19.175 --> 36:20.841
Why did you go
along with it,

36:20.843 --> 36:23.210
instead of following orders
and taking out Madaky?

36:23.212 --> 36:26.880
I suspect because he discovered
that I was in business with Madaky.

36:26.882 --> 36:31.050
It was when you hacked into his computer
to open the security door, wasn't it?

36:31.052 --> 36:32.918
This is bad. Gleason,

36:32.920 --> 36:34.552
you need to see this.

36:34.554 --> 36:36.754
CROMWELL: What? What is it?
What did he find?

36:36.756 --> 36:38.455
Is this for real?
WALTER: I'm afraid so.

36:38.457 --> 36:39.522
HAPPY:
Not good.

36:39.524 --> 36:40.623
CROMWELL:
I asked you

36:40.625 --> 36:41.523
a question, Gleason.

36:41.525 --> 36:42.223
What's the problem?

36:42.225 --> 36:44.158
I can't unlock the door.

36:44.160 --> 36:46.760
What do you mean
you can't unlock the door?

36:46.762 --> 36:49.462
Cromwell is in bed with Madaky,
but with the minds in this room,

36:49.464 --> 36:51.130
we can take her down
and get Madaky, too.

36:51.132 --> 36:52.197
You just need to decide

36:52.199 --> 36:53.765
whether you
can trust us

36:53.767 --> 36:55.199
within the next two seconds.

36:55.201 --> 36:57.067
CROMWELL:
Gleason, can you hear me?

36:57.069 --> 36:59.002
Why can't you unlock the door?

37:00.572 --> 37:01.637
One second.

37:02.806 --> 37:04.939
Madaky's door lock
is air-gapped,

37:04.941 --> 37:06.640
but there is a stand-alone
keypad that connects

37:06.642 --> 37:07.841
to the interior of the door

37:07.843 --> 37:09.075
via Ethernet cable.

37:09.077 --> 37:10.509
You punch a password
directly into it

37:10.511 --> 37:11.610
to open the door.

37:11.612 --> 37:13.044
Yeah, he's telling the truth.

37:13.046 --> 37:14.678
What happened, Chief?

37:14.680 --> 37:16.179
All those years doing
African aid work,

37:16.181 --> 37:20.016
you decide to finally get yours,
team up with Madaky

37:20.018 --> 37:22.651
and then take him out so you
don't have to share the profits?

37:22.653 --> 37:25.253
Well, you figured it out, and
you're not even a genius.

37:25.255 --> 37:29.190
I'd hoped to avoid all of this, but you
lot are too smart for your own good.

37:29.192 --> 37:32.259
So now Deputy Director Cooper
will pay the price.

37:39.668 --> 37:42.035
Come on, Deputy Director,
you're my passport to freedom.

37:42.037 --> 37:43.970
I will shoot.
Shoulder lock,

37:43.972 --> 37:46.005
jaw tension, shooter's
measured breathing--

37:46.007 --> 37:48.073
she's not bluffing.
COOPER: Come on, Cromwell,

37:48.075 --> 37:50.608
shoot me!
Uh, neither is Cooper.

37:52.211 --> 37:53.243
You...

37:53.878 --> 37:55.043
(gasps)

37:55.045 --> 37:56.711
COOPER:
Don't worry.

37:56.713 --> 37:58.746
She's empty. TOBY: I
can't wait to hear

37:58.748 --> 38:00.781
this explanation. When
she went to get the car,

38:00.783 --> 38:02.182
I unloaded her gun.

38:02.184 --> 38:03.816
When did you know she was dirty?

38:03.818 --> 38:05.751
I know my team.
There's no way

38:05.753 --> 38:07.719
you're going along
with an assassination plot.

38:07.721 --> 38:11.022
It had to be theater for someone's benefit.
Madaky's gonna

38:11.024 --> 38:14.825
count the minutes until
he can testify against you.

38:14.827 --> 38:16.793
Wow. Not that
his testimony

38:16.795 --> 38:18.728
is necessary.

38:18.730 --> 38:21.564
What's in his laptop should
put you in that Dutch cell

38:21.566 --> 38:23.299
you threatened to put
these boffins in.

38:23.301 --> 38:25.801
And I can't wait
for that to happen.

38:25.803 --> 38:29.871
You're a disgrace to MI6

38:29.873 --> 38:31.205
CABE:

38:32.775 --> 38:35.575
WALTER: You better get
going, too, Gleason.

38:35.577 --> 38:38.878
Police and fire trucks arriving.

38:38.880 --> 38:40.646
It's pretty high-profile stuff
for a secret agent

38:40.648 --> 38:42.948
who's supposed to be dead...

38:44.117 --> 38:45.716

Well, kind of.
They didn't mention you.

39:03.098 --> 39:04.764
They rarely do.

39:04.766 --> 39:07.032

It's just, we jumped
through so many hoops today,

39:25.848 --> 39:28.882
you know, performing
for Cromwell...

39:28.884 --> 39:30.850
faking a death,
risking our lives--

39:30.852 --> 39:33.986
all to avoid killing
an evil man.

39:33.988 --> 39:35.787

39:35.789 --> 39:38.756
it should be an easy call,

39:38.758 --> 39:41.625
Because... you're becoming
more and more human,

39:41.627 --> 39:44.994
and... humans shouldn't
treat death casually.

39:47.331 --> 39:49.698
Death is difficult.

39:49.700 --> 39:51.066
