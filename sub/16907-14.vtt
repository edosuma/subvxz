WEBVTT

00:02.044 --> 00:03.091
Previously on Arrow...

00:03.253 --> 00:04.505
What happened?

00:04.713 --> 00:07.808
Gregor. His loyalty lies with Kovar.
But Gregor is Pakhan.

00:07.966 --> 00:08.967
There is nothing we can do.

00:09.176 --> 00:10.428
We can kill him.

00:10.594 --> 00:12.847
<i>These corrupt cops are taking down
big drug scores.</i>

00:13.138 --> 00:15.766
You said you're not a criminal
'cause you believe in justice.

00:15.974 --> 00:18.648
Ask yourself, Warner.
Is that still the case?

00:19.102 --> 00:21.696
Now, what are the odds of Oliver Queen

00:21.897 --> 00:24.116
and the Green Arrow
being in Russia at the same time?

00:24.358 --> 00:27.077
Very good...
if Oliver Queen is the Green Arrow.

00:27.236 --> 00:30.285
<i>Four years ago,
The Hood took down Justin Claybourne.</i>

00:30.447 --> 00:33.121
I have been working on a location
for Claybourne's mistress.

00:33.283 --> 00:35.285
Prometheus' mother, we find her...

00:35.452 --> 00:37.125
We find the name for this son of a bitch.

00:40.958 --> 00:42.255
<i>Thanks for coming along.</i>

00:42.417 --> 00:45.170
I know that being my body man
isn't your job anymore.

00:45.379 --> 00:47.632
Sure it is.
Just a different suit, that's all.

00:47.798 --> 00:49.516
Now, we're sure this is the address?

00:49.675 --> 00:50.722
Yeah, Felicity is.

00:50.884 --> 00:52.056
According to her, this is the house

00:52.219 --> 00:54.062
that Justin Claybourne
bought for his mistress.

00:54.805 --> 00:56.227
Think she'll play ball?

00:56.473 --> 00:58.146
- That depends.
- On what?

00:59.184 --> 01:01.903
Whether or not she knows
her son is Prometheus.

01:09.069 --> 01:10.321
Amanda Westfield?

01:10.529 --> 01:11.576
Yes?

01:11.989 --> 01:13.707
Hi. My name is Oliver Queen...

01:13.907 --> 01:15.830
I know who you are.

01:16.076 --> 01:17.498
Mayor of Star City.

01:17.703 --> 01:19.171
May I come in?

01:27.462 --> 01:28.634
Very lovely home.

01:30.632 --> 01:32.976
For the past several months,

01:33.677 --> 01:36.180
there has been a serial murderer

01:36.680 --> 01:38.648
that has been terrorizing Star City.

01:39.641 --> 01:42.815
There is reason to believe
that this individual is your son.

01:43.854 --> 01:48.234
I haven't seen my son
since Justin Claybourne's funeral.

01:49.526 --> 01:52.905
But you know he's become something else,

01:53.447 --> 01:54.699
someone else.

01:55.282 --> 01:58.252
It's why you live here,
far away from Star City.

01:58.410 --> 02:00.913
I moved away because
there was nothing left for me there.

02:01.121 --> 02:03.670
Miss Westfield,
your son is an incredibly capable

02:03.832 --> 02:06.756
and incredibly dangerous individual.

02:06.918 --> 02:11.173
He has erased virtually all traces
of his identity from the Internet.

02:11.381 --> 02:13.054
And I am...

02:13.759 --> 02:16.558
Well, lam here simply
to ask you for his name.

02:18.263 --> 02:20.015
And what happens when you find him?

02:20.265 --> 02:22.267
He needs help. He...

02:23.894 --> 02:25.612
I want him to get that help.

02:29.232 --> 02:31.234
What you want...

02:32.944 --> 02:35.743
ls to cage him up like an animal.

02:36.281 --> 02:38.409
Like the animal who killed his father.

02:39.576 --> 02:41.499
He put an arrow in his chest.

02:41.662 --> 02:44.711
What kind of monster does that?

02:45.374 --> 02:46.671
Whatever my son is doing,

02:46.833 --> 02:50.133
he's doing it because he is hurt
and he is scared.

02:50.295 --> 02:54.425
And I will not help you destroy his life.

02:54.591 --> 02:56.434
Innocent people are dying,

02:56.593 --> 02:58.937
and you might be our only chance
to save them.

02:59.096 --> 03:00.473
Get out of my house.

03:02.099 --> 03:04.193
I'm easily reachable
if you change your mind.

03:05.394 --> 03:06.737
I won't.

03:29.209 --> 03:31.086
Hey! Get back to your seat!

03:31.253 --> 03:33.130
Can't a girl stretch her legs a little?

03:33.880 --> 03:35.427
Sorry, I didn't catch your name.

03:35.632 --> 03:36.633
And you're not going to.

03:36.800 --> 03:38.928
Guards aren't allowed
to fraternize with prisoners.

03:39.803 --> 03:42.647
So, take me out of these cuffs

03:43.056 --> 03:45.775
and I won't be a prisoner anymore.

03:45.976 --> 03:48.195
Sounds fun, but I'd lose my job.

03:48.979 --> 03:50.652
How about your life instead?

04:05.912 --> 04:07.664
This is your stop, ladies.

04:07.831 --> 04:08.923
Come on, ladies. Go!

04:12.878 --> 04:13.879
Next phase?

04:14.838 --> 04:17.432
Star City. Time to return home.

04:27.642 --> 04:29.110
How'd it go with Mama Prometheus?

04:29.269 --> 04:31.067
- It didn't.
- She's probably protecting him.

04:31.229 --> 04:33.027
Wow. My mom could
barely handle me being gay.

04:33.190 --> 04:35.192
Says she hasn't seen him
in over four years,

04:35.358 --> 04:36.826
but maybe they emailed.

04:36.985 --> 04:38.032
What is that?

04:38.236 --> 04:40.034
Just a little toy
that Curtis and I whipped up

04:40.238 --> 04:43.082
in case the Prometheus apple
didn't fall too far from the tree.

04:43.241 --> 04:44.709
It's a sniffer device.

04:44.868 --> 04:46.415
It basically pulls electronic data

04:46.578 --> 04:48.080
from any hard drives or devices nearby.

04:48.246 --> 04:49.748
- Did it work?
- Oh, yeah.

04:49.915 --> 04:52.088
A little too well.
I got a petabyte worth of data here.

04:52.292 --> 04:53.384
It's gonna take me a while
to work through.

04:53.543 --> 04:54.544
Which is fine

04:54.711 --> 04:56.429
because something happened
while you and John were away.

04:56.588 --> 04:57.714
- What?
- Check it out.

04:58.089 --> 04:59.682
Those are some familiar faces.

05:00.008 --> 05:03.137
- What happened?
- Jailbreak led by Liza Warner.

05:03.386 --> 05:05.388
<i>Didn't you put China White
in prison, like, forever ago?</i>

05:05.555 --> 05:06.647
Yeah, a couple times.

05:06.807 --> 05:08.354
Why does she look so familiar?

05:08.517 --> 05:10.736
Maybe she arrested you once.
She used to be a cop.

05:10.894 --> 05:11.941
Warner was, too.

05:12.103 --> 05:13.400
Lance convinced her
to turn over a new leaf,

05:13.563 --> 05:16.112
which, I'm guessing that these ladies
convinced her to turn back over.

05:16.274 --> 05:17.321
Well, according to the prisoners,

05:17.526 --> 05:18.573
they took the Corrections Department bus

05:18.735 --> 05:19.827
and they're headed towards Star City.

05:19.986 --> 05:21.829
Let's get to work on finding them.
We have to go.

05:21.988 --> 05:22.989
Yeah.

05:23.156 --> 05:24.533
Hey, you ready for your big moment?

05:25.408 --> 05:27.160
Oh. It's just a swearing-in ceremony.

05:27.410 --> 05:29.663
You're gonna be a cop again, Dinah.
It's no small thing.

05:30.539 --> 05:32.633
Yeah, I guess it's not.

05:34.918 --> 05:37.387
The city council wanted me
to remind you they have a vote scheduled

05:37.546 --> 05:39.594
right after the SCPD swearing-in ceremony.

05:40.131 --> 05:41.257
Right, right, right.

05:41.424 --> 05:43.927
They're gonna want to get
the show on the road, I totally get it.

05:44.094 --> 05:45.141
Hi...

05:45.345 --> 05:47.439
- I'm gonna need a minute or two, please.
- Mmm-hmm.

05:48.890 --> 05:50.267
- Hi.
- Hi.

05:51.268 --> 05:52.941
- Hey. Come here.
- How are you?

05:54.312 --> 05:55.438
Mmm.

05:56.940 --> 05:58.908
- What was that for?
- That was, "I'm sorry."

05:59.776 --> 06:01.824
For cancelling dinner on me last night?

06:02.028 --> 06:03.951
And the previous two times
that I also cancelled dinner, yes.

06:04.114 --> 06:06.116
Mmm-hmm. Does this mean
I'll get to see you tonight?

06:06.283 --> 06:08.411
Do you wanna have dinner
with the City Comptroller, too?

06:08.618 --> 06:10.040
- Am I ever gonna see you again?
- Of course.

06:10.287 --> 06:11.334
Okay.

06:11.788 --> 06:13.131
Is everything okay?

06:15.333 --> 06:16.710
Yeah, I think so.

06:16.877 --> 06:18.800
Yeah. Yeah. Yes.

06:18.962 --> 06:21.056
No, no, definitely not.

06:21.631 --> 06:22.632
Uh...

06:23.550 --> 06:27.555
Whatever is it, just, um, lay it on me.
What's up?

06:31.641 --> 06:33.143
- Are you the Green Arrow?
- Yeah.

06:34.519 --> 06:35.645
Really?

06:36.605 --> 06:37.777
No!

06:38.857 --> 06:41.656
No. I'm sorry, I thought that
you were doing a joking thing. I mean...

06:42.152 --> 06:44.280
So I did a joking thing back. Are you not?

06:44.654 --> 06:46.998
I was working on a different story,

06:47.198 --> 06:51.123
and, well, some things came up
that relate to you and...

06:51.328 --> 06:55.128
And then you just immediately jumped
to the most insane conclusion possible?

06:56.583 --> 06:59.757
So that's a "no" for the record?

06:59.961 --> 07:01.929
No. For the record.

07:04.007 --> 07:05.099
Well, good.

07:05.342 --> 07:08.061
'Cause I think our relationship
is complicated enough already

07:08.219 --> 07:09.345
just with you being mayor.

07:09.512 --> 07:10.513
Yeah, so do I.

07:10.680 --> 07:12.273
Mr. Mayor, everyone's waiting.

07:12.432 --> 07:14.309
- I have to go to this ceremony. Can I...
- Of course.

07:14.517 --> 07:15.860
Can I show you out?

07:18.438 --> 07:21.988
So, I figure that we go after Gregor
at the bathhouse

07:22.192 --> 07:24.536
because he's gonna have the least number
of men guarding him and...

07:24.694 --> 07:27.743
I mean, quite frankly, we can be sure
that he's not packing.

07:28.031 --> 07:31.251
- Anyway, he has men here, here, and here...
- No. No, no, no, no.

07:31.409 --> 07:32.535
No, what?

07:32.702 --> 07:34.750
Bathhouse is Gregor's turf.

07:35.163 --> 07:37.507
You cannot do it on your own.

07:37.707 --> 07:38.833
- Okay.
- We need army.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.627
Well then, who can we trust, Anatoly?

07:40.835 --> 07:42.929
Because we're basically
talking about a coup.

07:43.505 --> 07:46.304
Lying here
with my ass hanging out like baby.

07:47.926 --> 07:50.805
Don't worry about my men.
They are loyal to me.

07:51.054 --> 07:52.431
So am l.

07:52.764 --> 07:56.359
And, look, I'm gonna stay here

07:56.559 --> 08:00.314
until we take out Gregor
and we protect the Bratva.

08:00.730 --> 08:03.654
Ty <i>skazal,</i> stay? You going to leave?

08:04.109 --> 08:05.907
Look, Anatoly, I realized I...

08:06.111 --> 08:07.829
I have to get back to my life.

08:09.572 --> 08:13.122
But then I saw what Gregor did to you
because of me, and...

08:13.326 --> 08:15.374
You're a sin-eater, Oliver.

08:16.496 --> 08:20.672
In some cultures, there's this guy
who lives on the edge of village.

08:21.793 --> 08:25.718
And, when somebody dies,
they put body there

08:25.880 --> 08:29.225
and cover with fruits and vegetables,
and he eats that.

08:30.093 --> 08:31.595
He eats their sins?

08:31.803 --> 08:32.929
Yes.

08:33.138 --> 08:35.390
So they go on to the afterlife, yeah.

08:35.557 --> 08:37.855
He takes their sins

08:39.144 --> 08:40.361
as his own.

08:40.602 --> 08:42.605
You are very much like...

08:44.274 --> 08:45.275
What?

08:46.651 --> 08:47.777
In the past ten minutes,

08:47.944 --> 08:51.369
I've seen the same orderly pass by
five times with an empty stretcher.

08:52.240 --> 08:53.833
Could be one of Gregor's men.

08:54.284 --> 08:56.161
At any rate, they know that you are back.

08:56.453 --> 08:59.582
Or they're just here
to finish the job on you. Either way...

09:00.331 --> 09:03.756
It is time for me to <i>kak ty skazhesh,</i>
stretch my legs.

09:03.918 --> 09:05.170
- Here, come on.
- Thank you.

09:06.504 --> 09:09.098
...l will always have the courage
to hold myself and others accountable

09:09.257 --> 09:10.258
for our actions.

09:10.467 --> 09:14.563
"L will always uphold the Constitution,
my community, and the agency I serve."

09:14.721 --> 09:17.224
I will always uphold the Constitution,
my community,

09:17.390 --> 09:18.983
and the agency which I serve.

09:19.434 --> 09:21.402
Welcome to the SCPD, Officer Drake.

09:31.237 --> 09:32.955
Is everything okay with Susan?

09:33.323 --> 09:34.950
Yeah. What... Why?

09:35.158 --> 09:38.378
Just, you know, your assistant
was clocking a little tension, some...

09:38.578 --> 09:40.922
Thea, is my assistant your mole?

09:41.081 --> 09:43.960
I like to think of him
more as like my informant.

09:44.125 --> 09:46.253
Okay, what's going on?

09:47.670 --> 09:49.172
Susan asked me if I was the Green Arrow.

09:49.380 --> 09:52.179
Wait. What did you say to her?

09:52.342 --> 09:53.889
I handled it.

09:54.260 --> 09:55.682
I've been doing this
for a little while now.

09:55.845 --> 09:57.222
Can I talk to you for a minute, please?

09:57.472 --> 09:59.770
Quentin, if I delay this vote any more,
I'm gonna get impeached.

09:59.933 --> 10:02.732
Listen to me,
Liza Warner escaped last night.

10:02.936 --> 10:04.904
And China White, and Carrie Cutter.
We're on it.

10:05.063 --> 10:09.034
As a matter of fact, we are on it
sooner than I thought.

10:09.275 --> 10:11.744
- Felicity has their location.
- Great. Where am I going?

10:12.320 --> 10:14.539
I have put all three
of these women away, Quentin.

10:14.697 --> 10:16.040
This is nothing the team can't handle.

10:16.199 --> 10:18.998
Mmm-hmm. Yeah, I know that.
But this is personal, Oliver.

10:28.211 --> 10:30.509
<i>- Seems like we're a little late.</i>

10:31.047 --> 10:33.846
Looks like China White
had a falling out with the Triad.

10:34.008 --> 10:36.887
This is more than just a "falling out".
This is a massacre.

10:37.387 --> 10:42.234
Overwatch, all we've got here are bodies,
and a security camera.

10:42.517 --> 10:43.734
On it.

10:50.817 --> 10:52.490
That's Warner.

10:53.987 --> 10:55.113
This isn't on you, Quentin.

10:55.280 --> 10:56.406
I'm not so sure about that.

10:56.573 --> 10:59.452
But either way, we gotta stop
whatever it is these women are up to

10:59.659 --> 11:01.582
before more bodies drop.

11:09.252 --> 11:10.344
<i>Huh?</i>

11:16.259 --> 11:18.887
So, she said, "Where is the depository?"

11:19.053 --> 11:20.270
I don't think she got her answer.

11:20.430 --> 11:22.148
What "depository" is she talking about?

11:22.307 --> 11:24.275
Well, I mean,
the word could also mean "storage."

11:24.559 --> 11:26.812
So the three of them are looking
for something the Triad is storing?

11:26.978 --> 11:28.070
But that could mean anything.

11:28.271 --> 11:29.318
The Triad's got stashes all over the city.

11:29.480 --> 11:30.732
Whatever these three are looking for,

11:30.899 --> 11:32.651
they just killed an awful lot of people
trying to find it.

11:32.817 --> 11:36.071
We want them to stop dropping bodies,
we gotta find it first.

11:40.617 --> 11:41.618
It's all right.

11:58.134 --> 12:00.262
Regretting your choice not to go home?

12:00.428 --> 12:01.554
Not yet.

12:12.482 --> 12:13.779
Come on, come on, come on.

12:16.861 --> 12:20.991
That coup against Gregor?
That might be short-lived like us.

12:28.831 --> 12:30.504
This just arrived, boss.

12:31.251 --> 12:33.629
- What is it?
- No idea, but it said urgent, so...

12:39.509 --> 12:43.685
Chapman, I want the entire ACU
in the conference room in five minutes.

12:46.182 --> 12:48.025
Hey! Long time no see.

12:48.268 --> 12:50.020
- What're you doing down here?
- Oh...

12:50.228 --> 12:52.856
You know, just some damage control.
You have a minute?

12:53.022 --> 12:55.150
Yeah, for you? Anything. What's up?

12:55.358 --> 12:58.658
- Well, it's, um, Susan Williams.
- Hmm.

12:59.445 --> 13:01.948
She's suspecting
that Oliver's the Green Arrow.

13:02.115 --> 13:05.289
Why? I mean, other than the fact
that he is, but why?

13:05.493 --> 13:07.666
I don't know. I mean, I...

13:07.954 --> 13:09.627
He says that she confronted him about it,

13:09.789 --> 13:13.669
and then, he claims he put it to bed,
but she's not just gonna drop this.

13:13.876 --> 13:16.379
Agreed. What are we gonna do?

13:16.754 --> 13:20.054
Hack into her computer,
and find out what's there and delete it?

13:20.216 --> 13:21.638
Yeah, copy that.

13:21.884 --> 13:24.228
Susan William's computer... I'm in.

13:24.554 --> 13:27.228
- That was fast.
- Yeah, well, her password is "1-2-3-4".

13:27.432 --> 13:29.526
And she has a file here
named "Oliver Queen info"

13:29.726 --> 13:31.444
because she is super original.

13:32.854 --> 13:35.733
- Oh, God. She has...
- Everything.

13:36.566 --> 13:38.443
- She's been connecting the dots.
- This entire time.

13:38.609 --> 13:39.656
We have to delete all of this.

13:39.819 --> 13:41.537
Well, even if we do,
she got this from an outside source.

13:41.696 --> 13:43.744
She's just gonna be able to get it again,
and again...

13:43.906 --> 13:44.998
Okay, so what do we do?

13:49.245 --> 13:50.667
Fashion make-over?

13:51.247 --> 13:52.920
Kevlar weave in the jacket.

13:53.082 --> 13:54.254
Figured if I was gonna be back
in the field,

13:54.417 --> 13:56.090
I could have a little more protection.

13:57.420 --> 13:58.592
<i>There</i> he is.

14:07.305 --> 14:08.522
James Wong?

14:08.681 --> 14:11.275
We wanna have a little chat
about your dead Triad friends.

14:11.517 --> 14:13.190
I didn't have anything to do with that.

14:13.353 --> 14:14.354
We know.

14:14.604 --> 14:17.278
But what we wanna know
is what is the chúcáng?

14:17.440 --> 14:18.441
What?

14:18.775 --> 14:21.278
The "depository," the "storage,"
whatever it is.

14:23.279 --> 14:24.701
Tobias Church...

14:24.864 --> 14:25.865
ls dead.

14:26.032 --> 14:27.659
Yeah, and he never got to spend

14:27.825 --> 14:30.203
the $100,000,000 he got
from the AmerTek deal.

14:30.453 --> 14:32.000
That's the "depository."

14:32.455 --> 14:33.502
His cash stash.

14:33.664 --> 14:35.257
- Where is it?
- I don't know.

14:36.918 --> 14:38.340
Do we believe him?

14:44.634 --> 14:47.012
See? If I'd done that,
I would've sprained my wrist.

14:51.224 --> 14:52.271
So what is this place?

14:52.475 --> 14:54.477
Los Halcones' money laundering facility.

14:54.644 --> 14:56.066
It's likely Warner and her new friends

14:56.270 --> 14:58.898
are after $100,000,000
that Tobias Church left behind.

14:59.482 --> 15:01.985
And you think Church's old running buddies
might know where it is.

15:02.151 --> 15:04.279
Wild Dog and Mr. Terrific
are staking out the Bertinellis.

15:04.654 --> 15:06.952
Dinah and Spartan have eyes on the Bratva.

15:07.949 --> 15:11.294
You know,
you gotta get that new girl a codename.

15:13.162 --> 15:17.087
Well, when she's ready,
I was considering "Black Canary."

15:18.459 --> 15:19.927
You all right with that?

15:21.379 --> 15:23.473
Well, so long as she does Laurel proud.

15:25.550 --> 15:27.427
So, you really think
Warner's gonna show up here?

15:29.637 --> 15:30.809
Forget I asked.

15:37.937 --> 15:39.689
We don't have time for that, Cutter.

15:40.398 --> 15:43.447
Are you kidding me?
These things are expensive.

15:43.693 --> 15:45.536
We find the money,
you won't have to worry about that.

15:45.695 --> 15:47.447
Yeah, and when's that gonna happen?

15:47.613 --> 15:49.615
Not one of these idiots knew a thing.

15:49.824 --> 15:52.919
No, but they gave me the name
of someone who does.

15:53.161 --> 15:55.505
Don't worry,
everything is going down as planned.

15:55.663 --> 15:56.789
GREEN ARROW; Think again!

15:57.498 --> 15:59.671
You have failed this city.

15:59.876 --> 16:01.378
You're under arrest!

16:01.544 --> 16:03.137
Get on the floor
with your hands behind your head.

16:03.296 --> 16:04.388
On the ground!

16:04.547 --> 16:07.767
I'm good. Besides, I owe
this son of a bitch some payback.

16:31.532 --> 16:33.580
Freeze! Get on the floor!

16:33.743 --> 16:36.496
I listened to you once.
I'm not gonna make the same mistake twice.

16:36.662 --> 16:38.710
Since when is doing the right thing
been a mistake, Liza?

16:38.873 --> 16:40.625
Since you turned out to be a liar!

16:41.459 --> 16:42.756
L was all in, Quentin.

16:42.919 --> 16:46.924
You convinced me to turn myself in,
turn my life around.

16:47.131 --> 16:50.055
And then one day, I'm in the TV room
and what do I see?

16:50.259 --> 16:51.306
A news report about you

16:51.511 --> 16:54.139
working for one of the worst terrorists
this city has ever seen!

16:54.931 --> 16:56.933
He threatened my daughter, Liza.

16:57.099 --> 16:58.646
And so you did what you had to.

16:58.893 --> 17:00.611
Why shouldn't I do the same for myself?

17:00.770 --> 17:03.193
Because what I did, and what you're doing
are not the same thing!

17:03.356 --> 17:06.701
Sure they are.
We all do whatever it takes to survive.

17:06.943 --> 17:09.412
And if that means breaking a few laws,

17:09.612 --> 17:12.957
or betraying the people
who believe in you, so be it.

17:31.133 --> 17:32.806
What are you doing?
You're letting them get away!

17:32.969 --> 17:34.061
They're not our target.

17:34.303 --> 17:37.728
<i>You're under arrest for the murder
of Detective William Malone.</i>

17:43.145 --> 17:46.319
Listen to me, you're making a mistake.

17:46.482 --> 17:48.484
Drop the bow,
or we will light your ass up.

17:50.194 --> 17:51.195
Fine.

17:59.078 --> 18:00.170
Son of a bitch!

18:00.329 --> 18:01.501
<i>What do you mean,
they were after you?</i>

18:02.331 --> 18:06.086
Somehow, they found out about Billy.

18:06.836 --> 18:07.883
What?

18:08.087 --> 18:10.010
I'm with her. What're you talking about?

18:10.172 --> 18:12.971
Prometheus orchestrated things
so Oliver would kill Billy Malone.

18:13.509 --> 18:15.227
- What?
- DA Chase

18:15.428 --> 18:17.180
decided that we should cover it up, but...

18:17.346 --> 18:19.599
But somehow the ACU knows

18:19.765 --> 18:21.688
and thinks that you
took out one of their own.

18:21.851 --> 18:23.819
We're gonna have to handle this,
but right now,

18:24.020 --> 18:25.522
every second that we're down here

18:25.688 --> 18:27.440
that crew is getting closer
to Church's money.

18:27.607 --> 18:28.608
The more money they have,

18:28.774 --> 18:30.367
the more guns they can buy
and more damage they can do.

18:30.526 --> 18:32.824
Okay, let me talk with Pike,
I'll see if I can get him to stand down.

18:32.987 --> 18:36.207
Look, Quentin, I appreciate that,
but I gotta handle it this time.

18:36.365 --> 18:37.366
<i>Why'?</i>

18:37.742 --> 18:39.164
Because I'm the mayor.

18:44.040 --> 18:46.042
A lot of firepower in this room.

18:47.335 --> 18:48.382
What's going on?

18:48.919 --> 18:51.047
We just have a couple questions
for you, Captain.

18:51.213 --> 18:54.968
We heard the ACU attempted to apprehend
the Green Arrow last night, is that true?

18:55.176 --> 18:56.348
One hundred percent.

18:56.510 --> 18:58.763
He's a person of interest
in the murder of Detective Malone.

18:58.929 --> 19:00.272
Based on what evidence?

19:04.393 --> 19:06.111
This was delivered to me yesterday.

19:06.729 --> 19:09.403
Open it. You'll see what I saw.

19:10.066 --> 19:11.784
<i>The ME report for Billy Malone's autopsy.</i>

19:13.110 --> 19:16.080
Cause of death was an arrow consistent
with the ones the Green Arrow uses.

19:16.238 --> 19:18.240
This wasn't
in the original examiner's report?

19:18.658 --> 19:21.457
That one said the cause of death
was undetermined.

19:21.744 --> 19:23.417
I think we're looking at a cover-up.

19:23.579 --> 19:26.378
There's a lot of whack-jobs running around
with bows and arrows these days.

19:26.540 --> 19:27.962
Doesn't mean it was the Green Arrow.

19:28.125 --> 19:31.629
Like I said, the edgework on the wounds
was consistent with his arrows.

19:31.796 --> 19:36.142
Captain Pike, I have it on good authority
that the Green Arrow was not responsible.

19:36.926 --> 19:38.553
On whose authority?

19:39.261 --> 19:40.934
Right now, I'm not at liberty to say.

19:41.097 --> 19:42.770
Well then, I'm not at liberty
to drop this.

19:43.974 --> 19:46.352
Look, we're dealing
with a cop killer here.

19:48.437 --> 19:50.986
If that's all, I've got a lot of work.

19:51.148 --> 19:54.277
I'll keep you gentlemen posted
on the status of this investigation.

19:57.113 --> 19:58.285
I wouldn't panic just yet.

19:58.447 --> 20:00.541
We don't even know
if that report's legitimate.

20:01.075 --> 20:02.918
I think it's safe to say that it is.

20:03.577 --> 20:05.295
Question is, who sent it to Pike?

20:06.414 --> 20:08.462
Adrian, I'm sorry.
Could we have the room, please?

20:15.840 --> 20:16.841
It was Prometheus.

20:18.342 --> 20:19.514
Isn't that a little paranoid?

20:19.677 --> 20:22.146
I mean, I know that guy has given you
reason to be, but...

20:22.304 --> 20:25.433
The envelope that Pike gave me
was postmarked from Opal City.

20:25.599 --> 20:26.600
Yeah, so?

20:26.767 --> 20:28.986
Prometheus' mother is from Opal City.

20:29.228 --> 20:31.151
I'm not gonna even gonna ask
how you know that.

20:31.355 --> 20:32.481
I went to see her.

20:32.648 --> 20:35.492
This is Prometheus telling me
that he knows about that.

20:35.651 --> 20:37.904
And he is pushing back,
he is keeping me in check

20:38.070 --> 20:41.324
because he knows that I can't make a move
with the ACU breathing down my neck!

20:41.490 --> 20:42.912
Well, you can't just give up.

20:47.621 --> 20:48.668
I have to go.

20:51.500 --> 20:54.424
Hey. Sorry, I got your text and I...

20:55.671 --> 20:59.096
Huh. Okay. Look like you're having
as bad a day as I am.

20:59.341 --> 21:01.309
Really? Did you get fired today, too?

21:01.552 --> 21:02.974
What?

21:07.141 --> 21:09.690
My producer called me out on the carpet.

21:10.186 --> 21:12.359
Apparently, they received an anonymous tip

21:12.521 --> 21:16.071
that I have been plagiarizing
my stories for the past two years.

21:16.233 --> 21:19.863
And my laptop is filled
with incriminating evidence.

21:20.029 --> 21:21.201
Your laptop?

21:21.363 --> 21:23.707
It has all the fingerprints
of a hatchet job.

21:24.074 --> 21:27.578
- Okay, Susan...
- And I have to wonder about the timing.

21:27.745 --> 21:29.747
Because“.

21:29.914 --> 21:32.463
Nothing like this has ever happened to me

21:32.625 --> 21:35.504
before I asked
whether you were the Green Arrow.

21:35.669 --> 21:36.841
Susan.

21:38.422 --> 21:40.595
I swear to you,

21:40.758 --> 21:44.308
I didn't have anything to do with this,
I don't know anything about this.

21:47.056 --> 21:51.027
And you're going to stand here and tell me
that you're not the Green Arrow?

21:51.185 --> 21:54.906
Because that tattoo on your chest
marks you as a Bratva Captain.

21:55.231 --> 21:56.904
- Okay...
- I've got a photo

21:57.066 --> 21:59.569
of you with the Bratva in Russia

21:59.735 --> 22:02.454
at the same time that you were supposed
to be on a deserted island.

22:02.613 --> 22:04.957
I've got another photo, same time,

22:05.115 --> 22:08.494
of a man in a hood with a bow and arrow
operating in Russia.

22:08.911 --> 22:12.791
But now, of course,
I can't go public with any of it

22:12.957 --> 22:15.927
because I've been thoroughly discredited.

22:17.503 --> 22:19.926
- So, well done.
- If you could just...

22:20.089 --> 22:22.808
Unless the next words out of your mouth

22:22.967 --> 22:25.561
aren't going to be a lie,

22:25.719 --> 22:28.518
I'd really prefer
if you just said nothing at all.

22:39.900 --> 22:41.072
<i>He'!-</i>

22:41.569 --> 22:43.367
Hey, what's going on?

22:44.488 --> 22:46.957
Did you hack Susan Williams' computer?

22:47.116 --> 22:48.789
Okay, whoa, whoa.
Back up. You don't...

22:48.951 --> 22:52.626
Did you hack Susan Williams' computer?

22:54.957 --> 22:57.426
- Yes.
- What were you thinking?

22:57.585 --> 23:00.054
I was thinking that you were one
news story away from being outed.

23:00.212 --> 23:01.964
Thea asked me to put a few things
on Susan's computer and...

23:02.131 --> 23:04.600
Wait. Wait, wait, wait. Thea asked you?

23:04.758 --> 23:08.888
Yes. I don't know what she's planning
on doing, she said she had it handled.

23:10.472 --> 23:11.769
Why, what did she do?

23:19.023 --> 23:20.821
We'll have to make a run for it.
You ready?

23:20.983 --> 23:22.280
<i>Konechno.</i>

23:23.235 --> 23:24.828
<i>Anatoly Knyazev.</i>

23:55.601 --> 23:59.196
- What are you doing?
- I surrender, and he lets you live.

23:59.355 --> 24:00.902
He will kill you.

24:01.065 --> 24:05.411
He's going to kill both of us.
We are trapped, Anatoly.

24:05.569 --> 24:09.119
Only one of us is gonna make it
out of this alive.

24:09.281 --> 24:15.414
I am <i>avtoritet.</i> There is no way you are
going to suffer for my sins, Oliver.

24:16.121 --> 24:18.215
That's why I'm not giving you a choice.

24:22.294 --> 24:23.716
Yeah.

24:25.255 --> 24:28.179
Hey, stranger.
Haven't seen you around much today.

24:28.342 --> 24:31.346
Yeah, you know,
just busy taking out the trash.

24:31.512 --> 24:33.389
Yeah? Sanitation?

24:33.931 --> 24:36.434
More like public relations. Uh...

24:37.559 --> 24:41.189
I hear Green Arrow is public enemy
number one again.

24:41.355 --> 24:43.608
Yeah, well, now Oliver thinks

24:43.774 --> 24:46.653
that he can't make a move on Warner
and her crew. Yeah.

24:47.695 --> 24:48.867
And what do you think?

24:49.405 --> 24:51.248
I think that Warner's my mess to clean up.

24:51.699 --> 24:55.499
And I'm assuming Oliver
said that's not the case?

24:55.869 --> 24:57.837
What Oliver doesn't know

24:57.997 --> 25:02.298
is that the reason her rehabilitation
was short-lived

25:02.459 --> 25:06.214
was because she caught my confessing
to working with Damien Darhk on TV.

25:06.422 --> 25:07.469
Oh, wow.

25:07.673 --> 25:08.674
Yeah.

25:09.008 --> 25:12.182
That is an unbelievable

25:12.344 --> 25:14.267
load of crap, Quentin.

25:14.596 --> 25:17.770
- What?
- Liza Warner is a criminal.

25:18.934 --> 25:20.607
You didn't make her into one.

25:22.146 --> 25:25.867
You've got to stop taking responsibility
for other people's sins.

25:29.570 --> 25:32.494
You know, I really like
how wise you're getting lately.

25:32.781 --> 25:35.409
That's just because I have

25:36.326 --> 25:38.624
committed my own sin today.

25:38.954 --> 25:40.456
What sin?

25:41.665 --> 25:43.508
Don't worry about it.

25:43.667 --> 25:47.137
Why don't you worry about
catching Liza Warner?

25:47.296 --> 25:52.518
Not because you are responsible
but because she's a criminal.

25:58.474 --> 25:59.646
Let's get moving, yo.

26:03.062 --> 26:05.315
<i>THUG". Hey, hey. What's this now?</i>

26:05.481 --> 26:09.202
- Looks like three hot chicks. Huh?
- Especially this one.

26:15.157 --> 26:17.956
- Thanks for that.
- Anything for a friend.

26:31.757 --> 26:34.636
We're looking for
Tobias Church's rainy day account.

26:36.762 --> 26:40.983
The AmerTek money?
I tell you where it is, you let me go?

26:41.141 --> 26:43.690
No. You're gonna show us where it is.

26:43.852 --> 26:46.696
- What about the Green Arrow?
- The ACU is all over his ass.

26:46.855 --> 26:49.734
We've got nothing to worry about.
Let's go!

27:03.205 --> 27:05.207
You asked to see me?

27:05.374 --> 27:07.672
Did you know that Susan got fired today?

27:08.961 --> 27:11.055
I didn't know she was
gonna get fired, Oliver.

27:11.213 --> 27:13.011
You should have come to me with this.

27:13.173 --> 27:15.722
Listen, Ollie,
I just wanted to discredit her...

27:15.884 --> 27:18.808
Thea, you should have come
to me with this!

27:19.888 --> 27:21.435
And then what?

27:21.598 --> 27:24.977
We would have the same conversation
we are having right now.

27:25.144 --> 27:29.274
I would have told you that she was going
to out you as the Green Arrow...

27:29.439 --> 27:32.192
- She wouldn't do that to me.
- And then you would say that.

27:33.610 --> 27:36.284
Look, Ollie, the only reason
I didn't tell you

27:36.446 --> 27:39.916
was because I was trying to keep
your hands clean.

27:40.075 --> 27:43.955
- I know you care about her, so I...
- I do care about her.

27:45.122 --> 27:48.752
I also care that
you destroyed her reputation.

27:48.917 --> 27:51.761
She's gonna have a tough time
finding a decent job,

27:51.920 --> 27:56.676
she's certainly not gonna find a job
in journalism. You just blew up her life!

27:57.759 --> 28:01.263
Honestly, I didn't mean for it
to go this far.

28:01.430 --> 28:03.023
Yes, you did.

28:03.640 --> 28:05.893
You knew exactly what you were doing.

28:07.477 --> 28:10.105
And that's the part
that I don't understand.

28:12.774 --> 28:14.697
Who does that to a person?

28:17.988 --> 28:19.615
You got a minute?

28:20.115 --> 28:22.789
Yeah. We're done here.

28:25.370 --> 28:26.587
What do you need?

28:29.541 --> 28:32.636
Warner and her crew just hit
the Bertinellis. One dead,

28:32.794 --> 28:35.172
two in critical condition,
and they kidnapped number four.

28:35.339 --> 28:37.842
Yeah, that's a change in their MO,
they haven't been abducting people.

28:38.008 --> 28:39.305
Yeah, the guy they took is Enzo Russo.

28:39.468 --> 28:42.062
I'm thinking they took him 'cause
he knows where this depository is.

28:42.221 --> 28:44.144
I'm thinking, you know, maybe,

28:44.306 --> 28:47.355
Felicity can hack his cell,
we can track him that way.

28:47.809 --> 28:50.437
No. We have to let
the police handle this one.

28:50.604 --> 28:53.574
- What?
- The ACU will be all over me.

28:54.316 --> 28:57.695
- Okay, then send the team.
- I'm not risking anyone getting arrested.

28:57.861 --> 29:01.832
- What, you're just giving up now?
- Prometheus hasn't given me a choice.

29:02.449 --> 29:03.541
Um...

29:04.159 --> 29:07.333
Neither did Slade Wilson, or Damien Darhk,

29:07.496 --> 29:10.545
but with those guys, you didn't just pick
up your football and go home.

29:10.707 --> 29:12.334
- This is different.
- How?

29:13.085 --> 29:14.803
Because what's happening now,

29:15.796 --> 29:18.891
it's not something that Prometheus did.

29:20.592 --> 29:22.014
It's something I did.

29:22.177 --> 29:26.057
I mean, you're talking about Malone,
right? That was Prometheus.

29:26.223 --> 29:28.351
I fired the arrows.

29:32.437 --> 29:33.780
Listen.

29:34.189 --> 29:39.411
Earlier, Thea was talking to me about
not taking on other people's sins.

29:41.446 --> 29:45.622
What happened with Malone,
that's on Prometheus, not you.

29:46.827 --> 29:49.376
Well, Quentin, that advice
would mean a little bit more

29:49.538 --> 29:52.007
if it wasn't coming from Thea right now.

29:52.165 --> 29:54.088
Well, I don't know what that means.

29:54.251 --> 29:58.301
But I do know that if you're letting
Prometheus, ACU, or anyone else

29:58.463 --> 30:02.764
keep you from stopping Warner
and her buddies,

30:02.926 --> 30:05.429
then justice isn't being served.

30:10.058 --> 30:12.607
I will have Felicity look
at Russo's phone.

30:12.769 --> 30:16.069
That's what I wanted to hear.
I'll take another run at Pike.

30:16.231 --> 30:18.199
NO, I'll do it.

30:19.776 --> 30:20.868
You sure?

30:22.487 --> 30:25.957
I'm sure that I don't want Malone's death
to have been for nothing.

30:31.079 --> 30:32.922
- Mr. Mayor.
- You have a minute for me?

30:33.081 --> 30:36.381
Of course. What can I do for you?

30:37.919 --> 30:40.547
It's about the Green Arrow.

30:41.423 --> 30:42.970
- Sir, we've been over this.
- I know.

30:43.133 --> 30:46.603
And I know that I told you
that the Green Arrow was not

30:46.762 --> 30:48.856
responsible for Billy.

30:51.433 --> 30:53.652
That's not entirely true.

30:56.021 --> 30:57.489
You've got my attention.

30:57.647 --> 31:01.948
Prometheus manipulated
the Green Arrow into

31:02.110 --> 31:05.535
killing Detective Malone
by making it appear

31:05.697 --> 31:09.247
that Malone was Prometheus.

31:10.077 --> 31:14.423
Rightly fearing a city-wide panic,
District Attorney Chase

31:16.124 --> 31:18.593
covered up the circumstances
of Malone's death.

31:18.752 --> 31:20.299
And how do you know this?

31:20.462 --> 31:22.965
- The Green Arrow told me.
- You're in contact with the vigilante?

31:23.256 --> 31:25.805
I'm the mayor.
And, whether we like it or not,

31:25.967 --> 31:29.312
the Green Arrow and his team
are auxiliary law enforcement.

31:29.471 --> 31:31.815
Leaving whether I agree with that aside,

31:31.973 --> 31:33.975
why should I believe whatever he says?

31:34.142 --> 31:37.442
Because you know as well as I do
what he has done for this city.

31:37.979 --> 31:40.152
What's the simpler answer?

31:40.315 --> 31:44.991
That the Green Arrow all of a sudden,
out of nowhere, became a cop-killer?

31:45.153 --> 31:48.373
Or that he was manipulated by a psychopath

31:48.532 --> 31:52.787
who has had all of us, you included,
running in circles for months?

31:52.994 --> 31:54.962
He still killed Billy.

31:56.665 --> 31:58.542
Yes, he did.

31:59.709 --> 32:03.839
And that's something that he is gonna have
to live with for the rest of his life.

32:05.841 --> 32:09.061
All I'm asking is
that you don't let that stop him

32:09.219 --> 32:12.769
from being the hero
this city needs him to be.

32:19.020 --> 32:20.272
Ah...

32:20.689 --> 32:21.861
I...

32:22.691 --> 32:25.695
I don't know, Mr. Mayor.
I'm gonna have to think on this.

32:25.861 --> 32:27.454
Thank you for your time.

32:37.539 --> 32:38.540
Yeah.

32:39.958 --> 32:43.178
I got a GPS trace on Enzo Russo.
Well, at least, his cell phone.

32:43.336 --> 32:44.553
Okay, text me the address.

32:44.713 --> 32:47.808
Um, shouldn't we let the team handle
this considering you're the...

32:47.966 --> 32:51.345
And there's really no delicate way
to put this. The SCPD's most wanted?

32:52.888 --> 32:54.231
Text me the address.

32:59.186 --> 33:02.440
All right, I traced Russo's cell to Oak
Hill Memorial. John's already en route.

33:02.606 --> 33:06.702
Oak Hill Memorial. At least if we get shot
we don't have to go far.

33:06.860 --> 33:10.080
That is really not
an encouraging perspective, Rene.

33:11.448 --> 33:14.952
Hey, uh, just a quick note. Listen.

33:15.118 --> 33:17.746
Um, now that you're a freshly-minted
officer of the SCPD we can't have you

33:17.913 --> 33:20.917
going out into the field and having your
new co-workers recognize you, so...

33:21.082 --> 33:23.210
This is gonna involve me
wearing a costume, isn't it?

33:23.376 --> 33:25.674
Yeah, something like that, yeah.

33:32.469 --> 33:36.349
You know, I'm not sure I'm ready
to fill her shoes quite yet.

33:36.515 --> 33:39.519
Well, it's not shoes. It's a mask.

33:44.314 --> 33:48.945
Unit 54 spotted the Green Arrow's Ducati
heading southbound on Riverside.

33:49.110 --> 33:52.489
We believe he's en route to engage
Warner, Cutter, and Chien Na Wei.

33:52.656 --> 33:55.830
We're tracking him
and we'll be there when he does.

33:57.118 --> 33:58.620
Move out.

33:59.120 --> 34:00.542
Thanks for keying me in on this.

34:00.789 --> 34:02.336
Well, I trust you,
like I'm trusting that

34:02.582 --> 34:04.459
certain people can handle the truth.

34:04.709 --> 34:07.633
- Speaking of, how'd it go with Pike?
- We'll see.

34:08.295 --> 34:09.969
Alpha team in position.

34:10.382 --> 34:13.386
This ain't right, man.
Disturbing souls at rest.

34:13.552 --> 34:16.681
This is how you get haunted.
I feel a presence.

34:16.846 --> 34:18.723
Beta team in position.

34:19.808 --> 34:20.934
On site.

34:29.734 --> 34:31.360
How do you know it's this one?

34:31.735 --> 34:34.739
It's got the least amount of dust.
Help me move it.

34:42.789 --> 34:44.666
We have got the money, honey.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.128
Take what you can carry.
We'll come back for the rest.

35:18.491 --> 35:21.290
You did all this for money?
So what, you could go to the Caymans?

35:21.745 --> 35:25.045
You think this is about taking a vacation?
We're taking over.

35:25.373 --> 35:28.547
- We're taking back this city.
- Yeah, you and what army?

35:29.294 --> 35:30.887
This one.

35:37.761 --> 35:39.684
It's amazing the loyalty money can buy.

35:40.680 --> 35:41.681
Take them down!

36:55.630 --> 36:57.974
I'm gonna enjoy watching them
take you down.

37:01.386 --> 37:02.478
Go, go!

37:02.637 --> 37:03.889
Move on the targets!

37:25.910 --> 37:28.004
- Thank you, Captain.
- Happy to help.

37:28.246 --> 37:30.294
Didn't hurt that
the Mayor vouched for you.

37:30.457 --> 37:32.255
I'm sorry about Billy Malone.

37:33.334 --> 37:37.510
Know that it's something I'm gonna have
to deal with for the rest of my life.

37:39.299 --> 37:41.347
That's funny, that's what the Mayor said.

37:55.190 --> 37:59.320
Come to say goodbye?
Clear your conscience maybe?

37:59.527 --> 38:02.531
My conscience is clear.

38:03.072 --> 38:04.494
Hell, it is.

38:04.657 --> 38:08.628
Look in the mirror sometime, Quentin.
You're no better than me.

38:08.787 --> 38:11.711
I'm shot through with flaws, no question.

38:11.873 --> 38:15.468
But at least I'm not using
other people's sins to justify my own.

38:22.425 --> 38:24.393
Hey, hey. Are you okay?

38:24.719 --> 38:28.098
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. Just, she and I,
we got a little history. Hmm.

38:30.558 --> 38:33.858
So, uh, Oliver tells me
that you're the new Black Canary.

38:34.687 --> 38:36.234
Oh. Not yet.

38:37.690 --> 38:41.570
I'm not ready
to take your daughter's place, sir.

38:42.028 --> 38:44.406
Laurel didn't want someone
to take her place.

38:46.574 --> 38:49.202
She wanted someone
to carry on in her place.

38:57.919 --> 39:02.299
Hey. Nice job tonight.
Saw you on the news.

39:04.592 --> 39:07.562
We need to talk
about what happened, Speedy.

39:10.014 --> 39:11.857
Look, I'm sorry.

39:12.517 --> 39:13.734
Have you...

39:14.185 --> 39:16.187
Have you spoken to Susan?

39:16.479 --> 39:18.026
No, she's not returning my calls.

39:18.398 --> 39:21.277
I'm really sorry, Ollie.

39:22.610 --> 39:26.285
- I know I screwed up and...
- But you didn't make a mistake.

39:28.116 --> 39:29.538
You made a choice.

39:32.328 --> 39:35.582
- And you reminded me of someone.
- Who?

39:36.541 --> 39:37.713
Mom.

39:40.837 --> 39:42.635
She would've done something like this.

39:43.464 --> 39:46.263
Well, she would've done exactly this.

39:47.135 --> 39:49.854
She was a wonderful mother.

39:50.972 --> 39:55.478
But I think we both know that she
didn't always make the best choices.

39:56.728 --> 39:59.572
Whatever's gonna happen with Susan is...

40:00.273 --> 40:02.275
ls whatever's gonna happen.

40:06.029 --> 40:07.497
Right now...

40:09.866 --> 40:13.086
Right now, I'm really worried
about my baby sister.

40:26.174 --> 40:29.769
How very selfless of you.
Did not expect it.

40:31.512 --> 40:35.938
But don't worry, my word is good.
Anatoly will not be harmed.

40:48.196 --> 40:53.043
Anatoly. Look at you.
Hiding like a rat in the sewer.

40:53.201 --> 40:57.422
Did not expect this from Bratva Captain.
But then,

40:57.580 --> 41:00.504
you are not going to be Bratva Captain
for much longer.

41:04.963 --> 41:06.340
We have a problem.

41:06.506 --> 41:08.884
Adrian, just once,

41:09.050 --> 41:11.394
I'm gonna need you to walk into my office
and not say that.

41:11.552 --> 41:13.225
I'm serious.
I just got a heads up on something,

41:13.388 --> 41:15.186
and I think it's something you need
to get out in front of.

41:15.348 --> 41:16.645
Mr. Mayor.

41:16.808 --> 41:19.027
Something's happening.
I think you should turn on the TV.

41:22.021 --> 41:25.241
<i>Reports have recently surfaced
there has been a major cover-up</i>

41:25.400 --> 41:28.244
<i>relating to the murder of
ACU Detective William Malone.</i>

41:28.403 --> 41:29.825
<i>According to our sources,</i>

41:29.988 --> 41:33.663
<i>the Mayor's Office ordered
the falsification of autopsy reports</i>

41:33.825 --> 41:36.453
<i>to protect the identity
of Detective Malone's killer.</i>

41:36.619 --> 41:39.088
<i>If any of these allegations prove true,</i>

41:39.247 --> 41:42.672
<i>it would constitute a gross overstep
of the Mayor's authority,</i>

41:42.834 --> 41:47.010
<i>one that is likely to trigger impeachment
proceedings led by the Mayor's political...</i>

41:49.173 --> 41:50.891
Wow. You undersold this.

41:52.051 --> 41:53.928
This isn't a problem.

41:56.973 --> 41:59.476
This might be
the end of my administration.
