DANIEL: Need some company?

00:02.752 --> 00:04.212
- Daniel?

00:04.295 --> 00:05.588
How'd you know I'd be here?

00:05.672 --> 00:06.923
- Um, I didn't.

00:07.006 --> 00:09.467
I felt bad about Andi
and came here.

00:09.551 --> 00:11.594
- Me, too.

00:12.470 --> 00:14.514
- So it's sort of our spot.

00:14.597 --> 00:16.474
How's Andi?

00:17.475 --> 00:18.476
- Devastated.

00:18.560 --> 00:20.520
She won't talk to me.

00:20.603 --> 00:23.398
I don't know if I
did the right thing.

00:23.481 --> 00:24.858
- You did the right thing.

00:24.941 --> 00:26.985
- It doesn't feel like it.

00:27.068 --> 00:30.739
- Well, as my mom always says,
"Sometimes the right thing

00:30.822 --> 00:31.239
isn't always
the feel-good thing."

00:33.491 --> 00:35.410
Oh, man, I'm quoting my mom.

00:35.493 --> 00:36.119
What's happening to me?

00:36.202 --> 00:38.246
- Well, she's right.

00:40.039 --> 00:41.583
I wish Jax felt that way.

00:41.666 --> 00:44.461
He thinks the feel-good thing
is the right thing.

00:44.544 --> 00:45.628
- What'd he say about all this?

00:45.712 --> 00:48.006
- I don't know.

00:48.089 --> 00:49.382
I can't get ahold of him.

00:50.717 --> 00:52.302
- He'll turn up.

00:52.385 --> 00:53.595
Maybe he's busy.

00:55.638 --> 00:57.182
- You're never too busy for me.

01:01.352 --> 01:02.645
- [sighs]

01:02.729 --> 01:03.813
Open sesame!

01:07.484 --> 01:09.903
Abracadabra,
open lockers, adabra.

01:11.654 --> 01:12.405
Dah!

01:12.489 --> 01:15.033
Please?

01:15.116 --> 01:16.201
[sighs]

01:21.289 --> 01:22.081
My fingers.

I do deserve to be treated

- Emma!

02:16.469 --> 02:18.346
[laughs]

02:18.429 --> 02:23.893
It's good to see--
oh, I see what's happened.

02:23.977 --> 02:25.311
- You do?

02:25.395 --> 02:29.774
- Desdemona is getting anyone
who can stop her out of the way.

02:29.858 --> 02:31.150
- That works.

02:31.234 --> 02:35.613
I mean, can you explain that
in great detail in case I,

02:35.697 --> 02:37.824
as the Chosen One,
need to stop her?

02:37.907 --> 02:41.077
- Yes, you see, she wants to
be the last witch standing.

02:41.161 --> 02:43.663
And she sent you here
because the Chosen One

02:43.746 --> 02:46.749
guards the Last Lights.

02:46.833 --> 02:50.253
But with you here and all
the Council members gone...

02:52.213 --> 02:54.757
Oh, it's terrible.

02:54.841 --> 02:57.260
- It is horrible.

02:57.343 --> 02:59.554
Now, listen, what is this place?

02:59.637 --> 03:00.638
Where are we?

03:00.722 --> 03:03.850
- This is the Abyss,

03:03.933 --> 03:07.020
where
all lost things land--

03:07.103 --> 03:09.814
socks, glasses,

03:09.898 --> 03:14.986
keys, wallets.

03:15.069 --> 03:19.365
- I've been trying for days--
hours--to find a way out.

03:19.449 --> 03:20.617
- There's a door.

03:20.700 --> 03:22.827
Ah, right here.

03:24.287 --> 03:26.998
All the Council members
have a key that unlocks it.

03:27.081 --> 03:28.207
- Great, get to it then.

03:28.291 --> 03:30.126
- I can't.

03:30.209 --> 03:31.836
I-I lost the key.

03:31.920 --> 03:32.670
- Now we're stuck here!

03:32.754 --> 03:34.964
- Wait!

03:35.048 --> 03:36.507
I lost the key.

03:36.591 --> 03:37.884
- Yeah, we've
established that, thanks.

03:37.967 --> 03:43.014
- Now it's a lost thing,
which means it must be in here.

03:43.097 --> 03:43.765
- Yes, where?

03:43.848 --> 03:47.268
- Right...over...

03:48.561 --> 03:49.604
here.

03:50.396 --> 03:52.315
But it's not this one.

03:55.652 --> 03:57.320
- I asked you a question.

03:58.780 --> 04:00.907
What are you doing?

04:02.283 --> 04:06.829
- I-I was just,
uh...working out.

04:06.913 --> 04:09.832
Yeah, sideways pull-ups.

04:09.916 --> 04:11.960
Urgh, it burns way more
calories than the regular kind.

04:12.043 --> 04:13.753
- So you weren't trying
to pry your way

04:13.836 --> 04:15.129
into the entrance
of the Council?

04:15.213 --> 04:17.507
- The entrance to the Council's
behind these lockers?

04:17.589 --> 04:22.553
[laughs] You Council members--so
clever, so resourceful and so--

04:22.637 --> 04:24.889
- So not buying
your little act.

04:24.973 --> 04:25.765
You were trying to sneak in
and steal your powers back,

04:25.848 --> 04:27.725
weren't you?

04:27.809 --> 04:29.269
- Oh, of course not.

04:29.352 --> 04:32.939
- Or you are trying to figure
out how to open the entrance

04:33.022 --> 04:35.608
for the Last Light.

04:35.692 --> 04:37.485
- I-I--

04:37.568 --> 04:38.277
- I knew it.

04:42.115 --> 04:43.533
You won't get there before me.

04:43.616 --> 04:45.284
The Last Light is mine!

04:48.329 --> 04:49.956
- [gasping]

04:50.039 --> 04:51.874
The Last Light--that's like
some kind of

04:51.958 --> 04:53.501
3-D laser light show, right?

04:53.584 --> 04:54.335
Whoa.

04:56.671 --> 04:57.797
- Coach Desdemona?

04:57.880 --> 04:58.923
- What?

05:01.884 --> 05:04.220
Ugh, see what you've
done, my minion?

05:04.303 --> 05:06.139
Now we have one more witch
to get rid of.

05:06.222 --> 05:07.432
<i>JAX: Wizard!</i>

05:13.980 --> 05:14.981
- Psst.

05:16.232 --> 05:16.315
Psst.

05:18.443 --> 05:19.235
- [whispering]
Okay, you can stop now.

05:19.318 --> 05:21.112
- Can I come in?
MADDIE: Yes.

05:21.195 --> 05:24.198
My mom's at her exercise class.

05:24.282 --> 05:25.908
And by exercise, I mean she's
following Principal Alonso

05:25.992 --> 05:28.327
around the mall.

05:28.411 --> 05:30.580
- Do you think I should just
talk to her when she gets back?

05:30.663 --> 05:32.582
I feel silly sneaking around.

05:32.665 --> 05:34.542
- I think it's romantic.

05:34.625 --> 05:36.669
- You do?
- Yeah.

05:36.753 --> 05:38.421
We're having a secret,
forbidden love affair.

05:40.089 --> 05:41.507
That's why we work.

05:41.591 --> 05:43.009
- We work?

05:43.092 --> 05:44.635
Yes!

05:44.719 --> 05:47.638
- Don't do that...like ever.

05:47.722 --> 05:49.182
Let's get to school.

05:49.265 --> 05:51.100
- Wait, wait, wait, before we
go, I wanna show you a new trick

05:51.184 --> 05:52.226
I learned while I was training.

05:52.310 --> 05:53.936
- You've been training?

05:54.020 --> 05:55.688
- Yeah, haven't you?

05:55.772 --> 05:57.899
- Um, sure, uh-huh.

05:57.982 --> 05:59.817
So, anyway, this new trick?

05:59.901 --> 06:00.985
- So, you know how
I can morph things?

06:01.069 --> 06:04.447
- Yes, and it's awesome.

06:04.530 --> 06:06.449
These are the shoes
that used to be bananas.

06:06.532 --> 06:08.951
- Look at what happens if I
hold morphing just a little bit.

06:12.205 --> 06:15.249
- Whoa, what's that?

06:15.333 --> 06:16.834
- I don't know.

06:22.632 --> 06:23.174
- Cool.

06:23.257 --> 06:24.092
I know what it is.

06:24.175 --> 06:27.136
It's a cosmic trash can.

06:27.220 --> 06:28.429
- Is that a real thing?

06:28.513 --> 06:29.180
- Yeah, duh.

06:29.263 --> 06:30.556
I said it, didn't I?

06:36.896 --> 06:38.272
What's wrong?

06:38.356 --> 06:41.484
- I can't keep it open too long.
It...really drains me.

06:41.567 --> 06:44.153
- Oh, you'll just
have to practice then.

06:44.237 --> 06:46.989
I love my cosmic trash can.

06:47.073 --> 06:48.241
Think of all the things
we can throw in there

06:48.324 --> 06:49.826
and get rid of forever.

06:49.909 --> 06:52.161
Gum wrappers, banana peels.

06:52.245 --> 06:54.122
[gasps]
Emma and Andi.

06:54.205 --> 06:55.581
[laughs] Jax, too.

06:55.665 --> 06:57.041
We could get rid of
his accent forever.

06:57.125 --> 07:00.753
Oh, my gosh, it's gonna be so--
- Maddie, we talked about this.

07:02.130 --> 07:04.132
- Oh, it's not working.

07:04.215 --> 07:06.092
And I'm tired of trying.

07:06.175 --> 07:08.678
All this concentrating's
making me hungry.

07:08.761 --> 07:09.846
- There must be a way out.

07:09.929 --> 07:11.472
It worked for you before.

07:11.556 --> 07:12.765
- Uh, it must have
been the storm.

07:12.849 --> 07:15.560
The Realm goes
all funky during storms.

07:15.643 --> 07:19.564
Let's face it,
Desdemona fooled all of us.

07:19.647 --> 07:22.650
I can't believe she accused me
of wanting to end the Realm.

07:24.277 --> 07:25.820
We're being attacked.
Hit the floor.

07:25.903 --> 07:27.363
- Calm down.

07:27.446 --> 07:29.824
It's just a piece of paper.

07:29.907 --> 07:31.325
It's ripped.

07:33.995 --> 07:37.540
Locker moon raft.

07:37.623 --> 07:38.791
- Oh, it's in code.

07:38.875 --> 07:41.252
Someone's trying to
tell us something.

07:41.335 --> 07:42.712
Do you know how to decode it?

07:42.795 --> 07:44.630
- Decryption was part
of my guardian training.

07:46.090 --> 07:47.508
I could try.

07:51.137 --> 07:52.930
- Hi, Andi, what are you doing?

07:53.014 --> 07:55.892
- Oh, just using a box
instead of a backpack.

07:55.975 --> 07:56.893
Reduce, reuse, recycle.

07:56.976 --> 08:01.105
- Oh, how, uh,
ecofriendly of you.

08:01.772 --> 08:03.941
- I was joking, genius.

08:04.025 --> 08:05.318
I'm moving lockers.

08:05.401 --> 08:07.236
- What?
Why?

08:07.320 --> 08:09.363
- Mm, let's see.

08:09.447 --> 08:11.240
You, Phillip.

08:11.324 --> 08:12.241
You send Phillip away.

08:12.325 --> 08:15.244
Yep, that just about covers it.

08:15.328 --> 08:18.164
- You know I had no choice.
Phillip was dangerous.

08:18.247 --> 08:21.626
- Yeah, and so is Jax, but I
didn't send him off to Australia

08:21.709 --> 08:23.002
or wherever he came from, did I?

08:23.085 --> 08:25.588
- He's not.

08:25.671 --> 08:27.298
And even if he was, it's not
the same thing, and you know it.

08:27.381 --> 08:28.507
- Yeah, well...

08:28.591 --> 08:30.218
[in Australian accent]
G'day, mate.

08:30.301 --> 08:32.510
I mean, not g'day, ex-mate.

08:35.014 --> 08:36.933
- How many tools do
you have in there?

08:37.015 --> 08:38.808
- Only a couple...hundred.

08:42.063 --> 08:46.275
- [laughs]
She's still mad at you?

08:46.359 --> 08:47.902
I told you to keep zombie boy.

08:47.985 --> 08:49.528
- I couldn't.

08:49.612 --> 08:52.281
Eventually he would have bit
someone and...who knows what

08:52.365 --> 08:53.991
would have happened after that.

08:54.075 --> 08:55.534
- Depends who he bit.

08:55.618 --> 08:59.872
If he bit Maddie or Daniel, we
would have thrown a huge party.

08:59.956 --> 09:00.706
- You think that's funny?

09:00.790 --> 09:04.669
- Right, right, sorry, sorry.

09:04.752 --> 09:07.088
Listen, I figured out a way
to get my powers back.

09:07.171 --> 09:09.465
And I need your help.

09:09.548 --> 09:10.466
- You did?

09:10.549 --> 09:11.801
How?

09:11.884 --> 09:14.637
- Well, I could prove myself
worthy of them,

09:14.720 --> 09:17.974
and the Council will give them
back to me.

09:18.057 --> 09:20.017
- I can definitely
help with that.

09:20.101 --> 09:22.186
- Or I could just
break in and...

09:22.270 --> 09:23.646
- Steal them back?

09:23.729 --> 09:25.815
- Steal is such a harsh word.

09:25.898 --> 09:28.985
I-I'd prefer...borrow
or reclaim.

09:29.068 --> 09:30.695
- No way.

09:30.778 --> 09:33.739
- But I lost my powers
for you in the first place.

09:33.823 --> 09:36.617
- And you've never let
me forget it, have you?

09:40.121 --> 09:42.248
- [sighs]

09:42.331 --> 09:43.666
Good one, Jax.

09:47.086 --> 09:49.005
- Yeah, so we just
talked for a while.

09:49.088 --> 09:50.756
She's really upset about Andi.

09:50.840 --> 09:52.091
- Well, she's still dating Jax.

09:52.174 --> 09:52.967
- For now.

09:53.050 --> 09:54.677
But I've gotta get her back.

09:54.760 --> 09:56.929
I just have to figure
out my next move.

09:57.013 --> 09:57.972
- Mm-hmm, and when
is that gonna be?

09:58.055 --> 10:00.266
Next spring?

10:00.349 --> 10:01.392
- I don't know.

10:06.188 --> 10:08.399
- Can I sit down?

10:08.482 --> 10:09.525
- Free country.

10:10.776 --> 10:11.360
Which means I'm free to leave.

10:11.444 --> 10:13.487
EMMA: Come on, Andi!

10:21.329 --> 10:23.622
- Man, I have got to
work on my dramatic exits.

10:28.586 --> 10:31.047
- Trouble in paradise?
- No.

10:31.130 --> 10:33.549
We just had
a little...misunderstanding.

10:33.632 --> 10:36.385
- Which is just
a nice word for "fight."

10:36.469 --> 10:37.803
- I'm not surprised.

10:37.887 --> 10:41.057
Some people just don't know
how to be a good friend.

10:41.140 --> 10:42.600
- She'll get over it.

10:42.683 --> 10:44.185
- Yeah, right.

10:44.268 --> 10:46.562
Andi's the most stubborn
person on the planet.

10:46.645 --> 10:49.357
She didn't talk to me for all of
third, fourth and fifth grade.

10:49.440 --> 10:52.818
Best years of my life.

10:52.902 --> 10:55.863
Face it, your friendship
is officially over.

11:02.745 --> 11:06.332
- Oh, sorry, I was just looking
for the magic mobile phone.

11:06.999 --> 11:08.376
- You know where it is.

11:10.086 --> 11:12.171
- Hey, have you noticed
Desdemona acting

11:12.254 --> 11:13.714
kind of weird lately?

11:13.798 --> 11:17.676
I said hi to her in the hall,
and she just growled at me.

11:17.760 --> 11:20.054
- She did make us play
human bowling in gym today.

11:20.137 --> 11:21.180
We were the pins.

11:21.263 --> 11:24.016
Gigantor Joshua fell
on me like eight times.

11:24.100 --> 11:25.184
- Are you okay?

11:25.267 --> 11:26.268
- Yeah, I'm fine.

11:26.352 --> 11:28.521
Plus I got Gigantor Joshua back
by putting

11:28.604 --> 11:31.273
fire ants in his sock.

11:31.357 --> 11:32.983
But I'm fine.

11:34.318 --> 11:37.279
- So I was thinking
of spying on Desdemona.

11:37.363 --> 11:40.741
I'm calling it
"Operation Desde-monitor."

11:40.825 --> 11:42.243
[laughs] Get it?

11:42.326 --> 11:45.121
- Yeah, I got it.

11:45.204 --> 11:46.789
- So, what do you say?

11:48.249 --> 11:51.419
- Look, Emma, I really hope
this whole magic thing

11:51.502 --> 11:54.797
works out for you, but I'm not
your sidekick anymore.

12:01.387 --> 12:02.721
- [sighs]

12:05.891 --> 12:07.226
Come on, Lily, pick up.

12:08.269 --> 12:09.812
[electronic buzzing]

12:09.895 --> 12:11.188
- Weird.

12:13.107 --> 12:14.150
- [laughs]

12:17.194 --> 12:18.737
[computer ringing]

12:25.161 --> 12:26.245
- Hello, sir.

12:26.328 --> 12:28.038
<i>JAKE: Jax?</i>

12:28.122 --> 12:29.915
- How's everything
back at home?

12:29.999 --> 12:31.917
<i>JAKE: Let's dispense</i>
<i>with the niceties.</i>

12:32.001 --> 12:33.711
<i>I don't have a lot of time.</i>

12:33.794 --> 12:35.212
- No surprises there.

12:35.296 --> 12:35.880
<i>JAKE: What was that?</i>

12:35.963 --> 12:38.382
- Uh, nothing, sir.

12:38.466 --> 12:40.050
<i>JAKE: How</i>
<i>is the plan going?</i>

12:40.134 --> 12:42.887
<i>Did you get your hooks</i>
<i>into the Chosen One?</i>

12:42.970 --> 12:45.514
- Yes, we're still dating.

12:45.598 --> 12:47.391
Actually, we went on this
really fun date the other day.

12:47.475 --> 12:48.726
We went to the zoo.

12:48.809 --> 12:50.352
<i>JAKE: I don't</i>
<i>want details.</i>

12:50.436 --> 12:52.771
<i>I just want to know that you</i>
<i>will be ready by the Last Light</i>

12:52.855 --> 12:54.190
<i>to take over the world.</i>

12:57.776 --> 12:58.694
<i>JAKE: Your sisters</i>
<i>and I will be heading</i>

12:58.777 --> 12:59.737
<i>to the bunker soon.</i>

12:59.820 --> 12:59.904
- The bunker?

13:01.989 --> 13:03.365
<i>JAKE: You might not be</i>
<i>able to see me,</i>

13:03.449 --> 13:05.284
<i>but I can see you!</i>

13:05.367 --> 13:06.869
<i>Concentrate,</i>
<i>this is important!</i>

13:06.952 --> 13:11.040
- I am paying attention, sir.
The bunker.

13:11.123 --> 13:13.083
<i>JAKE: Yes, the one that</i>
<i>will keep us safe</i>

13:13.167 --> 13:14.710
<i>during the Last Light.</i>

13:14.793 --> 13:16.045
- Right, right.

13:17.046 --> 13:19.173
And Emma will be safe, right?

13:19.256 --> 13:20.299
Because she's with me?

13:20.382 --> 13:21.675
<i>JAKE: Who cares?</i>

13:21.759 --> 13:23.385
<i>Until she can combines the two</i>
<i>lights and then you push</i>

13:23.469 --> 13:25.804
<i>her into the Realm.</i>

13:25.888 --> 13:27.014
- What?

13:27.097 --> 13:28.891
<i>JAKE: Jax, what is</i>
<i>rule number one</i>

13:28.974 --> 13:31.060
<i>about ruling the universe?</i>

13:31.143 --> 13:33.354
- Uh, don't let the most
powerful witch in the world

13:33.437 --> 13:35.397
stick around.

13:35.481 --> 13:36.607
<i>JAKE: That's right.</i>

13:36.690 --> 13:38.901
<i>Don't let me down</i>
<i>like you usually do.</i>

13:40.402 --> 13:41.362
- I won't.

13:42.863 --> 13:43.405
- And it all
stays here forever?

13:43.489 --> 13:45.991
- Goodness no.

13:46.075 --> 13:48.369
This place couldn't fit
everything humans lose.

13:48.452 --> 13:49.912
[laughs]

13:49.995 --> 13:53.999
Once a month it crushes
and disintegrates everything.

13:54.083 --> 13:54.416
- What?

13:54.500 --> 13:55.292
When?

13:55.376 --> 13:57.920
- We better hurry.

13:58.003 --> 13:58.087
- You think?

14:05.636 --> 14:08.722
- It's weird that you're
doing your homework now.

14:08.806 --> 14:11.684
- It's like when you decided to
start cutting up your own food.

14:11.767 --> 14:12.685
- Don't listen to them.

14:12.768 --> 14:13.811
Learning feels good, doesn't it?

14:13.894 --> 14:15.938
Your brain absorbing
information.

14:16.021 --> 14:16.855
- Some brains more than others.

14:18.774 --> 14:18.941
Ah, oh, look.

14:21.860 --> 14:22.778
<i>URSULA: Maddie Winky?</i>

14:22.861 --> 14:25.281
<i>Could you open the door for me?</i>

14:25.364 --> 14:26.490
- [whispering] It's your mom.
- [whispering] Hide.

14:27.950 --> 14:30.411
- You're opening doors
for other people, too?

14:30.494 --> 14:32.246
I don't even know you anymore.

14:36.208 --> 14:38.877
- Um, I brought you
girls some brain food.

14:40.588 --> 14:43.966
Oh, look at my Maddie Winky

14:44.049 --> 14:45.884
reading...a book.

14:47.219 --> 14:50.848
Oh, I should...go get a camera
and record

14:50.931 --> 14:52.474
this momentous occasion.

14:52.558 --> 14:53.809
I'll be right back.

14:56.895 --> 14:57.688
[sniffing]

14:57.771 --> 15:00.649
Something smells
rotten in here.

15:01.317 --> 15:03.819
- It must be Katie.

15:03.902 --> 15:05.487
- Hey!

15:05.571 --> 15:09.325
- No, it's, uh--it's
coming from over here.

15:10.826 --> 15:13.495
Have you been using
eggs as shampoo again?

15:13.579 --> 15:16.957
- Every day.
- Okay.

15:17.041 --> 15:20.961
Um, no amount of shine is worth
smelling like that, okay?

15:33.724 --> 15:36.060
- Oh, hi, Jax.

15:36.143 --> 15:38.020
- Hey, I just wanted
to say I'm sorry.

15:39.897 --> 15:41.065
I brought you some flowers.

15:42.566 --> 15:46.153
- Did you just...rip
these out of my yard?

15:46.236 --> 15:49.031
- No, I-I got them
from a vending machine.

15:50.616 --> 15:53.118
Okay, fine, I didn't know
where else to get them from.

15:53.202 --> 15:55.579
- Uh-uh, nice try though.

15:57.539 --> 16:01.710
- Listen, I've been thinking
a lot about what you said.

16:01.794 --> 16:03.837
About getting my powers
back the honest way.

16:03.921 --> 16:05.339
- And?

16:05.422 --> 16:08.842
- And I wrote out a whole essay
to plead my case to the Council.

16:08.926 --> 16:10.552
- You did?

16:10.636 --> 16:12.304
Jax, I'm so proud of you.

16:12.388 --> 16:16.141
- It's just I don't know
how to get into the Council.

16:16.225 --> 16:17.935
I don't even know
where the entrance is.

16:18.018 --> 16:18.977
- I do.

16:19.061 --> 16:20.104
- You do?

16:20.187 --> 16:21.146
- Sure, let's go.

16:24.024 --> 16:25.693
- I'm so good.

16:25.776 --> 16:27.361
I almost believed myself.

16:29.738 --> 16:30.656
- What?
- Oh, nothing.

16:30.739 --> 16:32.616
Come on, let's go.

16:37.454 --> 16:40.207
- So, Kanay smell like
rotten eggs to witches.

16:40.290 --> 16:42.584
- [laughs]
- Not to all witches.

16:42.668 --> 16:44.253
- I hate hiding, Maddie.

16:44.336 --> 16:46.255
Maybe we should
just tell your mom.

16:46.338 --> 16:49.591
- Or...you know what would
be more fun than that?

16:49.675 --> 16:51.677
- What?
- Anything!

16:53.303 --> 16:56.223
Like showing the Panthers
your new trick.

16:56.306 --> 16:57.433
- No, it's private.

16:57.516 --> 16:58.183
- But I wanna see it again.

16:59.685 --> 17:00.811
I loved it.

17:02.146 --> 17:03.731
- Okay, then here we go.

17:03.814 --> 17:05.773
Stand back, Panthers, we
definitely don't want Katie

17:05.858 --> 17:07.233
to accidentally fall in
or anything.

17:17.368 --> 17:18.619
- Is that a black hole?

17:18.704 --> 17:19.788
Your fooling is based on
continuum

17:19.872 --> 17:22.165
and connecting dimensions.

17:22.249 --> 17:23.791
- Who cares?

17:23.876 --> 17:25.085
It's my cosmic trash can.

17:36.555 --> 17:37.556
- We have raft moon locker.

17:37.639 --> 17:39.683
- What could that mean?

17:43.103 --> 17:44.605
- More codes.

17:46.648 --> 17:48.067
- [laughs] And chips.

17:48.150 --> 17:48.233
Yes!

17:51.445 --> 17:53.363
Mm.

17:56.825 --> 17:58.160
- This is it.

17:58.243 --> 17:59.411
- And you can
definitely open it?

17:59.495 --> 18:00.621
I mean, I've heard
it's pretty tricky.

18:00.704 --> 18:02.706
- Come on, Hex.

18:06.877 --> 18:08.170
- Sweet.

18:08.253 --> 18:13.801
[laughs] Get out of my way,
you glorified comic book.

18:15.427 --> 18:16.512
Ow.

18:16.595 --> 18:17.971
- Stop fighting, you two.

18:18.055 --> 18:19.181
- He started it.

18:19.264 --> 18:20.682
- Just wait for me here.

18:20.766 --> 18:22.935
I'll go find the Council
and ask them to come out here.

18:23.018 --> 18:24.478
- What for?

18:24.561 --> 18:26.772
- So you can give
them your essay?

18:26.855 --> 18:28.607
- [laughs] Right.

18:28.690 --> 18:29.149
- Be right back.

18:37.616 --> 18:38.700
- So what does all this mean?

18:38.784 --> 18:41.703
Papers, a banana peel,
used lipstick.

18:42.955 --> 18:45.165
- Maddie Van Pelt.

18:45.249 --> 18:46.375
Wait.

18:46.458 --> 18:48.210
- Maddie Van Pelt is
sending us messages?

18:48.293 --> 18:50.462
- No, it's a portal.

18:50.546 --> 18:54.758
There's a portal between us
and the human world.

18:54.842 --> 18:55.801
- And a Van Pelt
is the gate keeper?

18:55.884 --> 18:57.970
- She may not know.

18:58.887 --> 19:00.222
Her boyfriend is a Kanay.

19:00.305 --> 19:04.226
He probably made a portal to
Limbo while morphing something.

19:04.309 --> 19:07.271
- Uh...ew, a Kanay.

19:08.355 --> 19:09.731
- Don't ew Diego.

19:10.440 --> 19:12.109
He's our way out.

19:14.778 --> 19:18.657
Nice time Diego opens a portal,
we'll throw them an SOS note.

19:26.498 --> 19:28.166
- Em, did you find them?

19:28.250 --> 19:30.419
- No, there's no one in there.

19:30.502 --> 19:31.712
The Council looks abandoned.

19:31.795 --> 19:33.422
- And what about my powers?

19:33.505 --> 19:34.882
They're in this little bottle,
probably on Agamemnon's desk.

19:34.965 --> 19:37.134
- No, I didn't see them.

19:37.217 --> 19:38.176
- Do you wanna
go back and check?

19:38.260 --> 19:39.595
And, hey, if you wanna grab
them--

19:39.678 --> 19:41.555
- Jax!

19:41.638 --> 19:42.806
- I was--I was just kidding.

19:44.850 --> 19:49.104
So...doors just open up
whenever you walk towards them?

19:49.187 --> 19:50.606
- Looks like it.

19:50.689 --> 19:52.357
- Because you're
the Chosen One?

19:52.441 --> 19:54.860
And nobody else knows how to
open them except the Council?

19:54.943 --> 19:56.612
- I don't think so.

19:56.695 --> 19:57.988
Oh, except for Andi.

19:58.071 --> 19:59.156
- Andi?

19:59.239 --> 20:01.241
- Yeah, she was horsing around
with the Hex

20:01.325 --> 20:03.118
and he showed her how.

20:03.201 --> 20:05.871
- You don't think
she'd tell anyone?

20:05.954 --> 20:08.415
- No, she's mad at me,
but she'd never tell anyone.

20:15.589 --> 20:17.215
- For her zombie boyfriend
she will.

20:19.718 --> 20:20.802
- [groans]

20:23.013 --> 20:26.391
- Here, the last thousand keys.

20:26.475 --> 20:28.101
- Be careful.

20:28.185 --> 20:32.147
Try not to mix them up
with the things...

20:33.732 --> 20:36.568
ones I've already tried.

20:36.652 --> 20:37.694
- Oops.

20:40.489 --> 20:41.740
- I've got it!

20:41.823 --> 20:43.867
[laughing]
I've got it, eureka!

20:43.951 --> 20:46.036
- Yeah, yeah, let's go!

20:51.500 --> 20:53.251
- We're out, we did it.

20:53.335 --> 20:54.461
- Free at last.

20:54.544 --> 20:56.922
- Now we must get
Lily out of Limbo.

20:57.839 --> 20:58.966
- Lily's in Limbo?

20:59.049 --> 21:00.133
- Yes, I'm afraid

21:00.217 --> 21:02.260
it was a terrible misjudgment
on my part.

21:02.344 --> 21:06.014
- How do you send
someone to Limbo anyway?

21:06.098 --> 21:08.642
- That is a Council secret.

21:08.725 --> 21:12.187
- But as the Chosen One, I
should know how to do it, right?

21:12.270 --> 21:15.315
- Yes, I suppose you're right.

21:15.399 --> 21:17.985
[laughs]
It's quite easy, actually.

21:18.068 --> 21:20.320
Instead of a rhyming spell,
you just picture

21:20.404 --> 21:23.740
