his concession.

Mary Matalin will serve
as counselor to the VP

01:10:42.989 --> 01:10:44.197

01:10:44.198 --> 01:10:46.032

Dick's main legal counsel,

01:10:47.535 --> 01:10:49.661
will play center

01:10:49.662 --> 01:10:52.038
relating to executive power.

01:10:52.039 --> 01:10:55.667
The president has Alberto Gonzales,

01:10:55.668 --> 01:10:57.377
Karl Rove,

01:10:57.378 --> 01:11:00.756
Karen Hughes as his team.

01:11:00.757 --> 01:11:03.216
Quite frankly, Gonzales has no clue.

01:11:03.217 --> 01:11:05.459
Um... Rove is a hack.

01:11:06.763 --> 01:11:09.139
Hughes should be in double-A ball.

01:11:09.140 --> 01:11:12.809
So we will have fairly
unobstructed access

01:11:12.810 --> 01:11:14.176

receives or sends,

01:11:44.926 --> 01:11:46.593
Paper shredders don't
work for e-mails.

War Powers Act interpretation
