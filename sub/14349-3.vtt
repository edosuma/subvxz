Captain's Log,
star date 1533.6.

00:05.071 --> 00:06.766
Now maneuvering
to come alongside

00:06.873 --> 00:09.034
cargo vessel Antares.

00:09.142 --> 00:10.609
Its captain
and first officer

00:10.710 --> 00:13.702
are beaming over to us
with an unusual passenger.

00:15.415 --> 00:18.077
All right, Chief,
begin materialization.

00:33.366 --> 00:35.561
Captain Ramart,
I'm Captain Kirk.

00:35.668 --> 00:37.158
This is my navigator
Tom Nellis.

00:37.270 --> 00:38.362
How do you do?

00:38.471 --> 00:40.598
And this is our
young castaway Charlie,

00:40.707 --> 00:42.334
Charlie Evans,
his dossier.

00:42.442 --> 00:43.932
Mr. Evans.

00:44.044 --> 00:45.944
We've heard
a great deal about you.

00:46.046 --> 00:46.944
Welcome aboard.

00:53.720 --> 00:55.312
[Ramart]
Wonderful boy, Charlie.

00:55.422 --> 01:00.052
It's been a great pleasure
having him aboard with us.

01:00.160 --> 01:01.923
The things
that he's learned...

01:02.028 --> 01:03.325
Absolutely.

01:03.430 --> 01:05.330
To think he spent practically
his whole life

01:05.432 --> 01:06.831
alone on that planet.

01:06.933 --> 01:09.697
How many humans
like me on this ship?

01:11.404 --> 01:13.804
Like a whole city
in space, Charlie.

01:13.907 --> 01:15.807
Over 400 in the crew
of a starship,

01:15.909 --> 01:17.501
aren't there,
Captain?

01:17.610 --> 01:19.805
428, to be exact.

01:19.913 --> 01:22.211
Anything we can do
for you, Captain?

01:22.315 --> 01:23.714
Medical supplies,
provisions?

01:23.817 --> 01:26.251
Hundreds!

01:26.352 --> 01:28.547
All human, like me.

01:28.655 --> 01:29.781
That's exciting.

01:31.257 --> 01:32.781
Is that the right word?

01:32.892 --> 01:34.621
That's perfect,
the exact word.

01:34.727 --> 01:37.628
We'd like to keep
Charlie with us.

01:37.730 --> 01:40.858
But with his closest
living relatives on Colony 5

01:40.967 --> 01:43.367
and your vessel
going that way--

01:43.470 --> 01:45.461
I'd like to see
your ship now.

01:45.572 --> 01:47.130
The people
and everything.

01:47.240 --> 01:49.140
You keep interrupting,
Mr. Evans.

01:49.242 --> 01:51.210
That's considered wrong.

01:53.346 --> 01:54.973
I'm sorry.

01:55.081 --> 01:57.982
We have a large supply
of entertainment tapes.

01:58.084 --> 01:59.984
No. We've a tight schedule
to make, Captain.

02:00.086 --> 02:01.849
Just 20 of us, we're
making out fine.

02:01.955 --> 02:03.855
This must be
a space first.

02:03.957 --> 02:05.857
A transport ship
that doesn't need anything?

02:05.959 --> 02:06.857
Nothing.

02:06.960 --> 02:08.359
Not even Sarian brandy?

02:08.461 --> 02:10.360
We're fine, thank you.

02:10.463 --> 02:11.862
Pleasant journey, Captain.

02:11.965 --> 02:12.863
Thank you.

02:15.869 --> 02:18.269
Yeoman Rand,
this is Charles Evans.

02:18.371 --> 02:20.271
Show him to his quarters

02:20.373 --> 02:23.774
and drop his records off
at Dr. McCoy's office.

02:23.877 --> 02:24.775
Yes, sir.

02:24.878 --> 02:26.277
Come with me, please.

02:36.789 --> 02:39.280
A-Are you a girl?

02:44.697 --> 02:46.096
Is that a girl?

02:46.199 --> 02:47.996
That's a girl.

03:02.715 --> 03:06.014
Space--the final frontier.

03:06.119 --> 03:10.556
These are the voyages
of the starship Enterprise.

03:10.657 --> 03:12.147
Its five-year mission--

03:12.258 --> 03:15.625
to explore
strange new worlds,

03:15.728 --> 03:18.925
to seek out new life
and new civilizations,

03:19.032 --> 03:22.991
to boldly go where no man
has gone before.

03:55.401 --> 03:59.701
Captain's Log,
star date 1533.7.

03:59.806 --> 04:01.967
We have taken aboard
an unusual passenger

04:02.075 --> 04:06.034
for transport
to Colony Alpha 5--

04:06.145 --> 04:07.578
Charles Evans,

04:07.680 --> 04:11.514
the sole survivor
of a transport crash 14 years ago.

04:11.618 --> 04:14.018
The child,
alone from age 3,

04:14.120 --> 04:15.382
has not only survived,

04:15.488 --> 04:19.117
but has grown to intelligent,
healthy adolescence.

04:22.060 --> 04:25.963
Tell me, um, the, uh, ship's supply
of food concentrates

04:26.065 --> 04:28.795
couldn't have lasted 14 years.

04:28.901 --> 04:31.802
After that I found
other things to eat,

04:31.904 --> 04:33.735
just...growing around.

04:33.840 --> 04:35.239
And you learned to talk

04:35.341 --> 04:37.935
by just listening
to the ship's tapes?

04:38.044 --> 04:39.944
The memory banks
still worked.

04:40.046 --> 04:43.277
They talked to me,
and I talked back.

04:43.383 --> 04:44.782
You're a 4-0.

04:44.884 --> 04:45.782
A what?

04:45.885 --> 04:49.946
4-0, 100%, sound of
wind and limb.

04:58.331 --> 05:01.198
That--That
Captain...Kirk?

05:01.301 --> 05:02.199
Yeah.

05:02.302 --> 05:05.203
Why does he call me Mr. Evans?

05:05.305 --> 05:06.704
'Cause that's your name.

05:09.008 --> 05:10.976
He's not...

05:11.077 --> 05:12.977
He isn't like
Captain Ramart.

05:13.079 --> 05:14.011
Well, no.

05:14.113 --> 05:17.276
Captain Kirk is
one of a kind, Charlie.

05:20.753 --> 05:24.484
Do you like me?

05:24.590 --> 05:25.488
Why not?

05:25.591 --> 05:28.719
Some...

05:28.828 --> 05:31.991
The other ship,
they didn't like me.

05:33.633 --> 05:35.533
I tried.

05:35.635 --> 05:38.035
I'm trying to make
people like me.

05:38.137 --> 05:40.537
I want them to like me.

05:40.640 --> 05:43.336
Most 17-year-olds do.

05:45.044 --> 05:46.443
Come on. Let's go.

05:46.546 --> 05:48.946
I'll show you
to your quarters.

06:18.878 --> 06:21.278
Hey, I'll put
the equipment away.

06:21.381 --> 06:23.281
See you in the rec room, huh?

06:23.383 --> 06:24.441
You got a deal.

06:24.550 --> 06:25.847
All right.

06:25.952 --> 06:26.850
Hello.

06:45.071 --> 06:46.971
I brought you a present.

06:47.073 --> 06:48.472
Oh, thank you.

06:48.574 --> 06:51.975
I really appreciate it,
but...but I have to go.

06:52.078 --> 06:53.477
I-l'm on duty.

06:53.579 --> 06:54.978
Do you like that kind?

06:55.081 --> 06:55.979
Yes, l...

06:59.986 --> 07:02.113
It's my favorite!

07:02.221 --> 07:03.620
Where did you get it?

07:03.723 --> 07:06.123
They don't have any
in the ship's stores.

07:06.225 --> 07:07.590
It's a present.

07:07.693 --> 07:09.524
I know,

07:09.629 --> 07:11.028
but where did...

07:11.130 --> 07:12.529
Gee, I'm late, Charlie.

07:12.632 --> 07:15.032
I--I really have to go.

07:15.134 --> 07:17.034
Can't you stay and talk?

07:17.136 --> 07:19.536
Look, I'm off duty at 1400.

07:19.639 --> 07:21.539
Why don't you join me

07:21.641 --> 07:24.041
in recreation room 6, deck 3.

07:24.143 --> 07:26.373
You got a deal.

07:29.081 --> 07:29.979
Charlie!

07:33.419 --> 07:34.818
Oh, I thought...

07:34.921 --> 07:36.821
Don't be angry. I didn't...

07:36.923 --> 07:37.890
I wanted...

07:37.990 --> 07:39.389
Charlie, you--you...

07:39.492 --> 07:44.691
You just don't go around
slapping girls on the...

07:47.733 --> 07:51.430
It's okay, but, uh,
just don't do it again.

07:51.537 --> 07:53.505
Don't be angry.

07:53.606 --> 07:56.234
Look, why don't you
tell Captain Kirk

07:56.342 --> 07:58.310
or Dr. McCoy what you did.

07:58.411 --> 08:00.242
They'll explain it
to you, okay?

08:00.346 --> 08:02.246
I will.

08:02.348 --> 08:04.111
Okay.

08:12.458 --> 08:16.360
But tell me, what reason
would he have to lie

08:16.462 --> 08:17.520
if there are Thasians?

08:17.630 --> 08:21.088
That is a very intriguing question.

08:21.200 --> 08:22.497
Scanners show no disturbances

08:22.602 --> 08:24.661
in this quadrant, Captain.

08:24.770 --> 08:25.668
Good.

08:25.771 --> 08:28.569
Dr. McCoy, Mr. Spock
is working out--

08:28.674 --> 08:30.039
Excuse me, Captain.
Status report.

08:30.142 --> 08:31.370
Thank you.

08:31.477 --> 08:34.173
He's working out a training program
for Charlie Evans--

08:34.280 --> 08:37.113
Earth history, his own background,
that sort of thing.

08:37.216 --> 08:39.616
I'd like you to give him

08:39.719 --> 08:41.118
the necessary medical orientation

08:41.220 --> 08:43.745
on the problems of, um...uh...

08:43.856 --> 08:46.086
adolescence.

08:46.192 --> 08:48.217
Wouldn't it be better
for a father image?

08:48.327 --> 08:50.727
He already looks up to you.

08:50.830 --> 08:52.229
The job is yours.

08:52.331 --> 08:53.821
Flattery will get you nowhere.

08:53.933 --> 08:58.063
Didn't the boy make
any reference to Thasians?

08:58.170 --> 09:00.297
Do you believe
the legend, Mr. Spock,

09:00.406 --> 09:02.306
that Thasians still exist
on that planet?

09:02.408 --> 09:04.308
Charlie's existence
proves there must be

09:04.410 --> 09:06.935
some intelligent
form of life on Thasus.

09:07.046 --> 09:09.537
He could not possibly
have survived alone.

09:09.649 --> 09:12.550
The ship's food would have
been exhausted in a year.

09:12.652 --> 09:14.552
He would have eaten
fruits, vegetables.

09:14.654 --> 09:17.145
Probes of Thasus indicate
very little edible life.

09:17.256 --> 09:18.655
Probes have been wrong.

09:18.758 --> 09:19.986
Doctor, are you speaking

09:20.092 --> 09:21.320
scientifically or emotionally?

09:21.427 --> 09:24.328
Gentlemen, the fact
is the boy is here

09:24.430 --> 09:27.490
and he's alive
and he needs our help.

09:27.600 --> 09:31.092
And he needs a guide
and father image, Jim.

09:31.203 --> 09:32.101
Hmm.

09:32.204 --> 09:34.468
I'll depend on
your astute abilities

09:34.574 --> 09:36.337
to supply him with that...

09:38.110 --> 09:40.943
or find him one.

10:38.004 --> 10:42.441
At first, his look
could hypnotize

10:42.541 --> 10:47.376
And then his touch
would barbarize

10:47.480 --> 10:54.852
His alien love
could victimize

15:10.843 --> 15:11.901
I don't think so.

15:12.011 --> 15:14.639
I won't get in the way.

15:17.149 --> 15:19.549
Can you boost
your power, Antares?

15:19.652 --> 15:21.552
We're barely reading
your transmission.

15:21.654 --> 15:24.054
We are at full power, Enterprise.

15:24.156 --> 15:26.056
I must speak to Captain Kirk.

15:26.158 --> 15:27.386
Kirk here, Captain Ramart.

15:27.493 --> 15:29.893
Captain, we're just
barely in range.

15:29.995 --> 15:31.292
I've got to warn--

15:33.399 --> 15:34.297
Re-establish contact.

15:34.400 --> 15:36.391
They're not transmitting.

15:36.502 --> 15:37.400
Keep trying.

15:37.503 --> 15:39.266
It wasn't very well constructed.

15:41.373 --> 15:44.433
Sweep the area
of the Antares transmission

15:44.543 --> 15:46.943
with our probe
scanners, Mr. Spock.

15:47.046 --> 15:48.240
Affirmative, Captain.

15:50.616 --> 15:54.017
You think something happened
to the Antares, Charlie?

15:54.119 --> 15:56.053
I--I don't know.

15:57.456 --> 16:00.516
Picking up some debris
on our scanners, Captain.

16:00.626 --> 16:01.957
What about the Antares?

16:05.798 --> 16:08.460
The debris is what's left
of the Antares.

16:20.579 --> 16:23.912
Captain Kirk from ship's galley.

16:24.016 --> 16:24.983
Kirk here.

16:25.084 --> 16:26.949
Sir, I put meat loaf
in the ovens.

16:27.052 --> 16:28.451
There's turkeys in there now,

16:28.554 --> 16:29.452
real turkeys.

16:29.555 --> 16:30.954
Chief, have you--

16:39.898 --> 16:42.958
Captain's Log,
star date 1535.8.

16:43.068 --> 16:45.969
USFA headquarters notified
of the mysterious loss

16:46.071 --> 16:48.301
of science probe vessel Antares.

16:52.511 --> 16:55.412
Your mind is not
on the game, Captain.

16:57.483 --> 16:58.916
Check.

16:59.018 --> 17:00.280
The Antares?

17:00.386 --> 17:04.049
A survey ship with
20 men aboard lost.

17:04.156 --> 17:06.646
No reason.

17:06.759 --> 17:08.157
Obviously, Captain Ramart

17:08.260 --> 17:10.728
was not aware of any trouble.

17:10.829 --> 17:12.228
I can't figure it.

17:12.330 --> 17:14.390
My own concern is more immediate--

17:14.500 --> 17:15.397
the boy.

17:15.501 --> 17:17.560
I can usually follow you,
Mr. Spock,

17:17.669 --> 17:19.068
but this time...

17:19.171 --> 17:21.662
he seemed to know what happened
to the Antares

17:21.773 --> 17:23.173
before we did.

17:24.742 --> 17:27.644
I'd call it a pretty long reach
for evidence.

17:27.746 --> 17:29.145
Come in, Charlie.

17:33.452 --> 17:35.386
And again.

17:35.487 --> 17:36.385
Check.

17:40.325 --> 17:41.519
Checkmate.

17:46.432 --> 17:48.332
Your illogical approach to chess

17:48.434 --> 17:49.833
does have its advantages

17:49.935 --> 17:51.334
on occasion, Captain.

17:51.437 --> 17:53.428
I'd prefer to call it inspired.

17:53.539 --> 17:54.938
As you wish.

17:55.040 --> 17:57.531
At any rate, the game is yours.

17:57.643 --> 17:59.941
You play chess, Charlie?

18:00.045 --> 18:04.072
Oh, l... I watched them play
on the Antares.

18:04.183 --> 18:05.582
Can I try?

18:05.684 --> 18:09.882
I place you in the hands
of our chess master.

18:12.091 --> 18:14.719
The principles of
three-dimensional chess

18:14.827 --> 18:16.624
are basically mathematic, Charlie.

18:16.728 --> 18:18.559
You put the white here

18:18.664 --> 18:20.564
and the black
on the secondary level.

18:20.666 --> 18:23.567
I know what it is.
Let's play.

18:24.903 --> 18:26.666
Very well.

18:44.123 --> 18:46.614
That was a mistake, Charlie.

18:46.725 --> 18:48.124
No, it wasn't.

18:52.464 --> 18:54.864
Checkmate.

18:54.967 --> 18:56.992
No, it isn't.

19:01.840 --> 19:03.137
If you'll excuse me.

19:35.941 --> 19:36.839
Oh, Charlie.

19:36.942 --> 19:38.341
I was looking for you.

19:38.443 --> 19:41.901
I'd like you to meet Tina Lawton,
Yeoman Third Class.

19:42.014 --> 19:42.912
Charlie Evans.

19:43.015 --> 19:45.313
Hello, Charlie.

19:45.417 --> 19:48.352
I thought you might enjoy meeting
someone your own age.

19:48.453 --> 19:50.580
Can I talk to you...alone?

19:52.357 --> 19:53.346
Charlie, Tina's...

19:54.927 --> 19:55.825
Excuse me.

19:55.928 --> 19:58.123
I must be wanted somewhere.

20:01.400 --> 20:03.231
That was...

20:03.335 --> 20:06.236
That was rude and
completely uncalled-for.

20:06.338 --> 20:08.397
But I want to talk to you.

20:08.507 --> 20:10.702
That's no excuse.

20:10.809 --> 20:12.834
Better learn that right now.

20:12.945 --> 20:14.845
You have to live
with people, Charlie.

20:14.947 --> 20:16.346
You're not alone anymore.

20:16.448 --> 20:17.813
But she's not as...

20:17.916 --> 20:19.543
She doesn't...

20:21.186 --> 20:23.848
She's not the same...

20:23.956 --> 20:25.355
Not like you.

20:27.526 --> 20:31.462
She's...
She's just a girl.

20:31.563 --> 20:32.495
You're...

20:34.099 --> 20:35.999
You smell like a girl.

20:38.870 --> 20:41.771
All the other girls
on the ship, they...

20:41.873 --> 20:44.171
they look just like Tina.

20:46.545 --> 20:47.944
You're the only one...

20:48.046 --> 20:50.480
who looks like you.

20:50.582 --> 20:52.846
You can understand, can't you?

20:54.720 --> 20:58.315
You know about...
being with somebody?

20:58.423 --> 20:59.822
Wanting to be?

21:02.027 --> 21:04.427
If I had the whole universe...

21:06.732 --> 21:08.893
I'd give it to you.

21:09.001 --> 21:11.697
When I see you, l...

21:11.803 --> 21:15.136
I feel like I'm hungry...

21:15.240 --> 21:16.138
all over.

21:17.776 --> 21:18.765
Hungry.

21:20.445 --> 21:22.845
Do you know how that feels?

21:31.556 --> 21:32.454
What?

21:32.557 --> 21:34.957
I wasn't sure I should, uh,

21:35.060 --> 21:36.960
talk to you about this.

21:37.062 --> 21:39.462
Charlie's 17 years old.

21:39.564 --> 21:40.622
Exactly, and he's--

21:40.732 --> 21:42.165
I talked to him
about the swat.

21:42.267 --> 21:43.666
It's not that.

21:43.769 --> 21:46.169
Captain, I've seen the look before,

21:46.271 --> 21:48.171
and if something isn't done,

21:48.273 --> 21:51.936
sooner or later I'm going
to have to hurt him.

21:52.044 --> 21:54.444
Tell him to leave me alone.

21:54.546 --> 21:55.513
Hmm.

21:55.614 --> 21:58.082
That wouldn't be good
for him right now.

21:58.183 --> 22:00.208
You see, I'm his first crush,

22:00.319 --> 22:01.718
his first love,

22:01.820 --> 22:03.219
and his first--

22:03.322 --> 22:05.722
Yes, Yeoman,
I'll talk to him.

22:05.824 --> 22:07.223
I'll look into it.

22:07.326 --> 22:08.725
Thank you, sir.

22:14.132 --> 22:15.565
Come in, Charlie.

22:21.273 --> 22:22.831
Uh, Charlie...

22:27.379 --> 22:29.279
Charlie, do you know, uh...

22:29.381 --> 22:31.281
anything about
this chess piece.

22:31.383 --> 22:34.375
Do you notice anything
peculiar in them...

22:35.754 --> 22:37.654
when you were using them
this afternoon?

22:37.756 --> 22:39.223
No, sir. Is that all?

22:39.324 --> 22:40.222
No.

22:40.325 --> 22:41.952
Sit down.

22:46.098 --> 22:47.497
Charlie, being 17

22:47.599 --> 22:50.500
is more than how many
years you've lived.

22:50.602 --> 22:52.001
It's a whole other thing.

22:52.104 --> 22:54.402
Dr. McCoy could probably

22:54.506 --> 22:57.031
explain the biological conditions.

23:00.278 --> 23:03.679
Well, let's--Iet's
use a specific.

23:03.782 --> 23:05.682
Yeoman Rand is a woman.

23:05.784 --> 23:07.809
Oh, I won't hit her
like that anymore.

23:07.919 --> 23:10.319
There's more to it
than that.

23:10.422 --> 23:13.516
Everything I do or say is wrong.

23:13.625 --> 23:17.026
I'm in the way,
I don't know the rules,

23:17.129 --> 23:21.031
and when I learn something
and try to do it,

23:21.133 --> 23:22.532
suddenly I'm wrong!

23:22.634 --> 23:23.532
Now wait...

23:23.635 --> 23:26.035
I don't know what I am...

23:26.138 --> 23:27.935
or what I'm supposed to be

23:28.039 --> 23:30.507
or even who.

23:30.609 --> 23:35.103
I don't know why
I hurt so much inside.

23:35.213 --> 23:37.511
You'll live, believe me.

23:37.616 --> 23:39.516
There's nothing wrong with you

23:39.618 --> 23:42.109
that hasn't gone wrong
with every other human male

23:42.220 --> 23:44.120
since the model first came up.

23:44.222 --> 23:46.190
What if you care for someone?

23:46.291 --> 23:47.918
What do you do?

23:51.062 --> 23:52.461
You go slow.

23:54.466 --> 23:57.264
Give it a while.

23:57.369 --> 23:58.700
You'll be gentle.

23:58.804 --> 24:02.706
I mean, it's not
a one-way street, you know,

24:02.774 --> 24:05.174
how you feel
and that's all.

24:05.277 --> 24:08.713
It's how the girl
feels, too.

24:08.814 --> 24:10.805
Don't press, Charlie.

24:12.951 --> 24:15.146
If the girl feels...

24:15.253 --> 24:17.153
anything for you at all,

24:17.255 --> 24:19.018
you'll know it.

24:19.124 --> 24:20.022
You understand?

24:20.125 --> 24:22.958
You don't think Janice...

24:23.061 --> 24:25.552
You...

24:25.664 --> 24:27.063
She could love me!

24:27.165 --> 24:29.065
She's not the girl, Charlie.

24:29.167 --> 24:32.068
The years are wrong,
for one thing,

24:32.170 --> 24:34.070
and there are other things.

24:34.172 --> 24:35.070
She can.

24:35.173 --> 24:36.071
No, Charlie.

24:36.174 --> 24:37.163
- She is.
- No.

24:37.275 --> 24:39.140
But if I did what you said!

24:39.244 --> 24:41.769
There are a million things
in this universe you can have

24:41.880 --> 24:44.144
and a million things
you can't have.

24:44.249 --> 24:46.513
It's no fun facing that,

24:46.618 --> 24:49.018
but that's the way things are.

24:49.120 --> 24:51.520
Then what am I going to do?

24:51.623 --> 24:54.786
Hang on tight and survive.

24:54.893 --> 24:57.259
Everybody does.

24:57.362 --> 24:58.192
You don't.

24:58.296 --> 25:00.764
Everybody, Charlie. Me, too.

25:03.134 --> 25:05.329
I'm trying...

25:05.437 --> 25:07.598
but I don't know how.

25:07.706 --> 25:09.173
[Intercom Whistles]

25:13.345 --> 25:14.403
Kirk, here.

25:14.513 --> 25:16.413
[Uhura]
You asked to be notified

25:16.515 --> 25:19.416
when we were to make our
course adjustments, sir.

25:20.519 --> 25:23.420
Ask Mr. Spock to see to it.

25:23.522 --> 25:24.580
[Click]

25:26.358 --> 25:28.417
Charlie, come on with me.

25:41.373 --> 25:43.273
You've got to slap the floor

25:43.375 --> 25:45.775
to absorb the energy when you fall.

25:45.877 --> 25:47.276
Go ahead. Try it.

25:52.384 --> 25:54.784
Like everything else,
it takes practice.

25:54.886 --> 25:55.944
Try again.

26:00.325 --> 26:01.724
Good. That's much better.

26:01.826 --> 26:03.623
Now I'll show you
a shoulder roll.

26:09.801 --> 26:10.859
Try that.

26:10.969 --> 26:12.869
I don't want to do that.

26:12.971 --> 26:15.371
It makes it hard to teach you--

26:15.473 --> 26:17.373
I don't want to do that.

26:17.475 --> 26:19.875
All right, Charlie.
Lesson's over for today.

26:19.978 --> 26:22.879
You were going to teach me
how to fight.

26:22.981 --> 26:26.382
You have to learn to protect yourself
in a fall first.

26:26.484 --> 26:29.385
It's more than teaching you
to defend yourself.

26:29.487 --> 26:32.285
Charlie, I want you
to learn...

26:33.858 --> 26:34.916
Charlie?

26:36.361 --> 26:38.261
Hey, Sam,
let me borrow you

26:38.363 --> 26:40.763
for a couple easy throws,
all right?

26:40.865 --> 26:42.457
Watch this, Charlie.

26:48.373 --> 26:50.273
That wasn't so bad, was it?

26:50.375 --> 26:51.774
Now I'll throw him.

26:51.876 --> 26:53.275
Here we go, Sam.

26:59.317 --> 27:00.716
That looks hard.

27:00.819 --> 27:01.877
Aw!

27:01.987 --> 27:03.386
Come on, Charlie.
Try it.

27:06.825 --> 27:08.725
Attaboy. Let's get over.

Oh!

27:34.586 --> 27:35.985
Don't laugh at me!

28:00.645 --> 28:01.703
Charlie.

28:01.813 --> 28:03.713
He shouldn't have done that.

28:03.815 --> 28:06.716
It's not nice
to laugh at people.

28:06.818 --> 28:08.718
What happened to him, Charlie?

28:08.820 --> 28:09.878
He's gone.

28:13.324 --> 28:14.723
That's no answer.

28:14.826 --> 28:15.884
He's gone!

28:15.994 --> 28:17.894
I didn't mean to do that.

28:17.996 --> 28:19.395
He made me do it!

28:19.497 --> 28:20.896
He laughed at me.

28:26.071 --> 28:28.733

Two men from security, on the double.

28:28.840 --> 28:29.898
Affirmative.

28:30.008 --> 28:32.408
What are you
going to do to me?

28:32.510 --> 28:33.909
I'm confining you
to quarters.

28:34.012 --> 28:35.502
You stay there.

28:35.613 --> 28:37.513

28:37.615 --> 28:39.276
I'll make them go away, too.

28:39.384 --> 28:41.284
They won't hurt you, Charlie.

They'll take you to your quarters.
Go with them.

28:54.365 --> 28:55.263
No!

29:09.047 --> 29:11.106
Go to your quarters.

29:13.318 --> 29:15.548
He was going to hurt me.

29:15.653 --> 29:16.711
Go to your quarters

29:16.821 --> 29:19.551
or I'll pick you up
and carry you there.

29:39.344 --> 29:41.244
I won't let you.

29:41.346 --> 29:43.439
That's your choice, Charlie.

29:54.025 --> 29:55.492
I won't let them hurt me.

29:55.593 --> 29:57.356
They won't hurt you.

30:01.032 --> 30:03.364
[Intercom Whistles]

30:03.468 --> 30:05.834
[Uhura]
Captain Kirk.

30:08.506 --> 30:10.565
Kirk here.

30:10.675 --> 30:14.236
Security reports that
all phaser weapons have disappeared.

30:14.345 --> 30:16.370
Shall I repeat, Captain?

30:17.482 --> 30:19.780
No, I heard you.

30:24.088 --> 30:28.354
Have Dr. McCoy and Mr. Spock
meet me in the briefing room.

30:33.131 --> 30:36.032
Thasians have been
referred to in our records

30:36.134 --> 30:38.534
as having the power
to transmute objects

30:38.636 --> 30:40.035
or render substances
invisible.

30:40.138 --> 30:42.038
It's generally
been regarded as legend,

30:42.140 --> 30:44.540
but Charlie seems
to possess this power.

30:44.642 --> 30:46.974
What are chances
Charlie's not an Earthling

30:47.078 --> 30:48.477
but a Thasian?

30:48.580 --> 30:49.979
No, I don't think so,

30:50.081 --> 30:51.480
unless they're exactly
like Earthlings.

30:51.583 --> 30:53.983
The development
of his fingers and toes

30:54.085 --> 30:55.985
exactly matches present
development of man.

30:56.087 --> 30:57.486
Well, whatever he is,

30:57.589 --> 30:59.489
we've some idea of his power.

30:59.591 --> 31:02.355
I know what I saw
in the gymnasium.

31:02.460 --> 31:03.859
Considering the effect

31:03.962 --> 31:06.556
normal adolescents have
on a home, Charlie...

31:06.664 --> 31:08.564
Short-tempered,
because he doesn't understand.

31:08.666 --> 31:11.396
He needs, he wants.
Nothing happens fast enough.

31:11.502 --> 31:12.901
The probability is
he's responsible

31:13.004 --> 31:16.030
for the destruction
of the Antares,

31:16.140 --> 31:18.540
which indicates total disregard
for human life.

31:18.643 --> 31:20.543
He doesn't understand
what life is.

31:20.645 --> 31:21.839
He's a boy.

31:21.946 --> 31:24.847
Well, what do we do
with this boy, Jim?

31:24.949 --> 31:27.349
How do we keep him caged up?

31:27.452 --> 31:28.851
It goes even further, Doctor.

31:28.953 --> 31:31.854
We can't take him
to Earth Colony 5.

31:31.956 --> 31:34.652
Imagine what he'd do
in an open, normal environment.

31:36.160 --> 31:38.390
I've talked with him,
listened.

31:38.496 --> 31:42.398
He's a boy in a man's body
trying to be adult,

31:42.500 --> 31:43.865
adolescence getting in the way.

31:43.968 --> 31:45.299
With a weapon in him,

31:45.403 --> 31:47.598
which could destroy
you or anyone

31:47.705 --> 31:49.104
anywhere on this ship.

31:51.976 --> 31:54.706
Well, for the moment
he's stopped.

31:54.812 --> 31:57.212
You're an authority
he respects, Jim.

31:57.315 --> 31:58.407
Agreed.

31:58.516 --> 32:02.282
The struggle must remain
between you and him.

32:02.387 --> 32:03.979
Should any of us
interfere...

32:10.561 --> 32:13.758
You wanted to ask me
something he said.

32:13.865 --> 32:15.958
Are you responsible
for what happened

32:16.067 --> 32:18.433
to the Antares, Charlie?

32:18.536 --> 32:19.560
Why?

32:19.671 --> 32:21.400
Answer me.

32:22.774 --> 32:23.832
Yes.

32:25.843 --> 32:27.242
There was a warped baffle-plate

32:27.345 --> 32:28.744
on their energy pile shield.

32:28.846 --> 32:30.143
I made it go away.

32:30.248 --> 32:32.580
It would've blown up anyway.

32:35.520 --> 32:37.420
Well, they weren't nice to me!

32:37.522 --> 32:40.423
They wanted to get rid of me.

32:40.525 --> 32:42.186
They don't now.

32:44.295 --> 32:45.626
What about us, Charlie?

32:51.970 --> 32:53.369
I don't know.

33:06.985 --> 33:09.977
We're in the hands
of an adolescent.

33:14.192 --> 33:15.591
Lieutenant,
raise Colony 5.

33:15.693 --> 33:18.093
I want to speak directly
to the governor.

33:18.196 --> 33:21.097
Navigator, lay a course
away from Colony 5.

33:21.199 --> 33:22.393
Buy me some time.

33:24.002 --> 33:25.526
Aah!

33:28.606 --> 33:31.507
Spock, get the doctor
up here on the double.

33:31.609 --> 33:33.008
How bad is it?

33:33.111 --> 33:35.011
I think
it's all right, sir.

33:35.113 --> 33:37.013
There's no reason
for that panel

33:37.115 --> 33:38.514
to cross-circuit like that.

33:38.616 --> 33:41.517
I checked it over myself
not 15 minutes ago.

33:41.619 --> 33:44.019
Captain, I can't feed
any course coordinates

33:44.122 --> 33:45.453
into the panel, sir.

33:45.556 --> 33:46.955
It rejects the course change.

33:47.058 --> 33:48.355
Helm doesn't respond either, sir.

33:50.895 --> 33:53.489
Mr. Spock, you getting
any instrument readings?

33:53.598 --> 33:54.690
Yes, sir. There's a--

33:54.799 --> 33:56.858
''Tiger, tiger, burning bright

33:56.968 --> 33:58.902
in the forest of the night.''

34:00.471 --> 34:01.529
Mr. Spock.

34:01.639 --> 34:02.697
I'm trying to--

34:02.807 --> 34:04.138
''Saturn rings around my head,

34:04.242 --> 34:06.403
down a road that's Martian red.''

34:07.545 --> 34:09.409
You're trying
to change course, Captain.

34:11.149 --> 34:12.206
You can't.

34:12.315 --> 34:16.252
I want to get to Colony 5
as soon as we can.

34:18.989 --> 34:20.422
Release the transmitter.

34:20.525 --> 34:23.119
You don't need all that
subspace chatter.

34:25.129 --> 34:26.527
What's going on here?

34:26.630 --> 34:28.531
Spock calls me to the bridge

34:28.632 --> 34:31.033
and goes into some
kind of poetry.

34:31.135 --> 34:32.431
See to her, Doctor.

34:32.536 --> 34:33.594
''Once upon a midnight dreary

34:33.704 --> 34:34.762
while I pondered,
weak and weary...''

34:34.871 --> 34:36.965
Very nice, Mr. Ears.

34:38.810 --> 34:40.710
I can make him
do anything--

34:40.812 --> 34:42.210
whirl around, laugh, anything.

34:44.315 --> 34:45.646
That's enough, Charlie.

34:45.750 --> 34:47.149
Don't you think he's funny?

34:47.251 --> 34:48.616
I think he's funny.

34:48.719 --> 34:50.083
Leave my crew alone.

35:05.470 --> 35:07.870
Jim, he'll soon reach a point

35:07.972 --> 35:09.701
where he won't back down.

35:09.807 --> 35:10.865
I know.

35:15.880 --> 35:17.472
Charlie, what's wrong?

35:36.234 --> 35:38.134
I have something for you.

35:48.513 --> 35:50.913
Pink is your favorite,
isn't it?

35:54.519 --> 35:57.386
You don't walk into a room
without knocking.

35:59.023 --> 36:01.924
Don't ever lock your door
on me again, Janice.

36:02.026 --> 36:03.357
I love you.

36:03.461 --> 36:05.861
I'll lock it when I please.

36:05.963 --> 36:08.431
What is it you want, anyway?

36:12.870 --> 36:14.132
You.

36:26.284 --> 36:28.946
I only want
to be nice to you.

36:29.053 --> 36:29.917
I can give you anything.

36:30.021 --> 36:31.283
Just--Just tell me.

36:31.389 --> 36:32.583
I want you to get out.

36:32.690 --> 36:35.090
But I only want
to be nice to you.

36:35.193 --> 36:36.592
Get out, Charlie.

36:36.694 --> 36:39.686
I can't make it
any plainer than that.

36:39.797 --> 36:41.025
I love you.

36:41.132 --> 36:43.965
You don't know
what the word means.

36:44.068 --> 36:45.433
Then show me.

36:45.536 --> 36:46.833
No!

36:51.209 --> 36:52.267
Charlie.

37:01.085 --> 37:03.110
Why did she do that?

37:08.359 --> 37:09.758
I loved her,

37:09.860 --> 37:12.021
but she wasn't nice at all.

37:15.366 --> 37:17.766
What you did
wasn't nice either,

37:17.868 --> 37:20.632
but I still need you, Captain.

37:20.738 --> 37:23.639
The Enterprise isn't
quite like the Antares.

37:23.741 --> 37:25.800
Running the Antares was easy.

37:28.679 --> 37:30.579
You have to be nice.

37:32.717 --> 37:33.775
All right?

37:53.337 --> 37:54.565
Mr. Spock?

37:55.673 --> 37:56.731
My legs--

37:56.841 --> 37:57.899
They're broken.

38:01.612 --> 38:02.909
Let him go, too, Charlie.

38:03.014 --> 38:04.538
Why?

38:04.649 --> 38:06.048
Because I'm telling you to.

38:06.150 --> 38:09.551
You need me to run the ship,
and I need him.

38:22.733 --> 38:25.133
If you try
to hurt me again,

38:25.236 --> 38:28.034
I'll make lots of people go away.

38:28.139 --> 38:29.538
And what about Yeoman Janice?

38:29.640 --> 38:31.130
Is she dead?

38:31.242 --> 38:32.504
Gone? Destroyed?

38:35.880 --> 38:37.404
I won't tell you.

38:46.824 --> 38:48.883
Growing up isn't so much.

38:49.994 --> 38:53.395
I'm not a man,
and I can do anything!

38:53.497 --> 38:54.555
You can't.

39:01.839 --> 39:03.739
I'll activate
the force field myself.

39:03.841 --> 39:05.741
You can return to your section.

39:05.843 --> 39:07.743
He had a mean look.

39:07.845 --> 39:09.745
I had to freeze him.

39:09.847 --> 39:11.337
I like happy looks.

39:15.853 --> 39:18.048
Aren't you coming in?

39:46.384 --> 39:47.976
That wasn't nice.

39:49.387 --> 39:50.786
You'll be sorry.

39:50.888 --> 39:52.287
You wait. You'll see.

39:52.390 --> 39:54.790
You'll be sorry you did that.

39:56.394 --> 39:57.520
You will.

40:19.884 --> 40:22.318
Aah!

40:22.420 --> 40:23.819
[Laughing]

40:23.921 --> 40:24.979
No.

40:25.089 --> 40:26.317
No laughing!

40:26.424 --> 40:27.482
[Silent]

40:27.591 --> 40:28.649
Aah!

40:28.759 --> 40:30.818
Aah! Aah!

40:30.928 --> 40:32.725
[Moaning]

40:44.942 --> 40:46.432
Captain Kirk...

40:46.544 --> 40:49.206
my instruments show
we're receiving a message

40:49.313 --> 40:52.771
on subspace frequency 3,
ship-to-ship.

40:52.883 --> 40:54.214
I can't hear it, sir.

40:55.386 --> 40:56.785
You're creating
that message, Charlie,

40:56.887 --> 40:59.287
or you're blocking one
that's coming in.

40:59.390 --> 41:00.789
It's my game, Captain.

41:00.891 --> 41:02.290
You have to find out.

41:02.393 --> 41:05.294
Like you said,
that's how the game's played.

41:05.396 --> 41:06.795
You can have it now.

41:06.897 --> 41:09.798
I've locked on course
for Colony 5 again.

41:41.432 --> 41:42.831
I've waited long enough.

41:42.933 --> 41:44.662
I'm going to take him on.

41:44.768 --> 41:46.599
You don't have
any special immunity.

41:46.704 --> 41:47.762
Not anymore.

41:47.872 --> 41:49.271
Push far enough,

41:49.373 --> 41:51.068
he'd send you to oblivion, too.

41:51.175 --> 41:52.164
Mr. Spock?

41:52.276 --> 41:53.368
Out of the question.

41:54.879 --> 41:56.278
Wait a minute.

41:56.380 --> 41:57.745
Does Charlie...

41:59.383 --> 42:00.441
Now, wait...

42:00.551 --> 42:03.452
Spock, has he done away with anybody

42:03.554 --> 42:04.953
since he took over?

42:05.055 --> 42:07.455
Not so far as we know.

42:09.393 --> 42:10.792
Then maybe he can't.

42:10.895 --> 42:12.294
Could be
he's overreached himself.

42:12.396 --> 42:15.695
It's a big ship.
He's taken full control.

42:16.901 --> 42:18.801
If we could tax his power--

42:18.903 --> 42:21.303
turn on every
device on the ship,

42:21.405 --> 42:24.806
every circuit,
every light, all of it--

42:24.909 --> 42:26.809
and while
he's fighting that,

42:26.911 --> 42:28.811
if I could distract him,

42:28.913 --> 42:30.813
maybe you could tranquilize him,

42:30.915 --> 42:32.815
keep him under,

42:32.917 --> 42:34.817
until we reach Colony 5.

42:34.919 --> 42:35.977
Risky, Jim.

42:37.087 --> 42:38.987
If we don't try, Doctor,

42:39.089 --> 42:41.489
he'll get rid of us anyway.

42:42.927 --> 42:44.326
There's no choice, gentlemen,

42:44.428 --> 42:45.759
none at all.

42:46.864 --> 42:49.765
I can make you all go away...

42:49.867 --> 42:51.391
anytime I want to.

42:54.371 --> 42:57.363
Get out of my chair
and get out now.

42:57.474 --> 42:59.999
I've got your ship, Captain.

43:04.715 --> 43:06.876
Maybe, Charlie,

43:06.984 --> 43:10.476
but I don't think
you can handle any more.

43:16.493 --> 43:19.053
I think you've
reached your limit

43:19.163 --> 43:21.597
and can't take on
one more thing.

43:26.170 --> 43:28.070
But you're going to have to.

43:36.847 --> 43:39.748
I could've sent you away before,
but I didn't.

43:39.850 --> 43:42.011
You're going to have
to take me on.

43:42.119 --> 43:43.381
Don't make me do it.

43:43.487 --> 43:46.320
You've got my ship,
and I want it back.

43:46.423 --> 43:50.257
I want my crew back whole,

43:50.361 --> 43:53.524
if I have to break
your neck to do it!

43:55.366 --> 43:56.765
Don't push me.

Captain, the navigation console
is clear now.

44:24.862 --> 44:26.659
The ship is answering the helm.

44:26.764 --> 44:28.664
Sir, something off
our starboard bow.

44:28.766 --> 44:31.166
The message says
they're from Thasus.

44:36.006 --> 44:37.234
Oh.

44:39.510 --> 44:40.909
Captain, how did l--

44:41.011 --> 44:42.171
It's all right, Yeoman.

44:42.279 --> 44:43.678
Sensors show something's there.

44:43.781 --> 44:46.682
Deflectors indicate
no solid substance.

44:49.787 --> 44:50.981
No!

44:52.523 --> 44:53.922
Oh, no, please...

44:54.024 --> 44:56.015
don't let them take me.

44:57.461 --> 44:59.486
I can't live with them anymore!

45:10.474 --> 45:11.873
You're my friends.

45:13.410 --> 45:16.038
You said you were my friends.
Remember?

45:17.948 --> 45:20.439
When I came aboard!

45:28.826 --> 45:29.884
Please...

45:32.329 --> 45:34.229
I want to go home.

45:37.000 --> 45:38.991
Take me home.

45:44.007 --> 45:47.340
I have taken my form
centuries ago,

45:47.444 --> 45:50.470
so that I may
communicate with you.

45:52.750 --> 45:55.651
We did not realize
until too late

45:55.753 --> 45:57.584
that the boy had gone.

45:57.688 --> 46:00.088
We are saddened
that his escape

46:00.190 --> 46:02.920
cost the lives
of the first ship.

46:03.026 --> 46:04.926
We could not help them,

46:05.028 --> 46:07.428
but we have returned your people

46:07.531 --> 46:09.431
and your ship to you.

46:10.968 --> 46:13.436
Everything is as it was.

46:17.307 --> 46:19.707
Oh, I won't do it again.

46:19.810 --> 46:21.209
Please, I'll be good.

46:21.311 --> 46:24.610
I won't ever do it again.

46:29.953 --> 46:32.251
I'm sorry about the Antares.

46:34.291 --> 46:36.088
I'm sorry!

46:37.227 --> 46:38.888
When I came aboard!

46:43.333 --> 46:44.425
Please?

46:45.602 --> 46:47.570
I want to go with you.

46:49.473 --> 46:51.236
Help me!

47:04.321 --> 47:07.722
The boy belongs
with his own kind.

47:07.825 --> 47:10.521
That would be impossible.

47:10.627 --> 47:13.858
We can teach him to live
in our society.

47:13.964 --> 47:17.365
If he can be taught
not to use his power...

47:17.467 --> 47:19.992
We gave him power
so he could live.

47:20.103 --> 47:22.003
He will use it always,

47:22.105 --> 47:26.064
and he would destroy you
and your kind,

47:26.176 --> 47:29.077
or you would be forced
to destroy him

47:29.179 --> 47:30.669
to save yourselves.

47:30.781 --> 47:32.908
Is there nothing you can do?

47:33.016 --> 47:35.211
We offer him life,

47:35.319 --> 47:38.220
and we will take care of him.

47:42.259 --> 47:43.920
Come, Charles.

47:50.634 --> 47:51.692
Oh, please...

47:52.936 --> 47:54.836
Don't let them take me.

47:56.940 --> 47:59.135
I can't even touch them!

48:00.277 --> 48:01.335
Janice...

48:02.946 --> 48:04.345
They can't feel.

48:05.415 --> 48:06.814
Not like you!

48:09.419 --> 48:10.909
They don't love!

48:13.590 --> 48:14.784
Please...

48:16.927 --> 48:18.656
I want to stay...

48:18.762 --> 48:19.820
stay...

48:19.930 --> 48:20.988
stay...

48:21.098 --> 48:22.156
stay...

48:22.266 --> 48:23.324
stay...

48:23.433 --> 48:24.559
stay...

48:24.668 --> 48:25.726
stay.

48:37.514 --> 48:41.974
[Uhura] Charlie's back on board
the Thasian ship, sir.

48:43.587 --> 48:46.715
They signaled they're leaving.

48:56.900 --> 48:58.299
It's all right, Yeoman.

48:58.402 --> 49:00.302
It's all over now.
