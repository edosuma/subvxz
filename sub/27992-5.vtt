00:03.927 --> 00:09.015
Whoever murdered Daniel Ugara
and the Hayes is involved

00:09.040 --> 00:12.655
in people trafficking.
Their response was to target you.

00:14.935 --> 00:17.094
I reckon that we need to
look into this guy,

00:17.095 --> 00:18.774
Graeme Benson.

00:18.775 --> 00:19.934
You must be Cassie.

00:19.935 --> 00:22.934
We've decided that
Calum Dunwoody's suicide

00:22.935 --> 00:25.134
warrants further investigation.

00:25.135 --> 00:26.975
I can't stop thinking about you.

00:28.895 --> 00:30.414
There are other people at risk.

00:30.415 --> 00:32.014
What, like that mad woman's daughter?

00:32.015 --> 00:33.054
Olivia?

00:33.055 --> 00:34.654
Yeah, you ought to rein her in.

00:34.655 --> 00:37.974
Me and Zezi and Daniel are blood,

00:37.975 --> 00:41.420
which is why I'm not going anywhere
until I find her.

00:43.055 --> 00:44.494
Niki?

00:46.575 --> 00:49.414
She was getting threatening
phone calls from a woman.

00:49.415 --> 00:51.454
It could be Andrea Doyle.

00:51.455 --> 00:52.940
You're not my boss.

00:55.754 --> 00:56.794
Really?

01:04.306 --> 01:05.546
Jamie!

01:54.646 --> 01:57.345
Andrea Doyle's been taken
to the interview room.

01:57.346 --> 02:00.065
We've found a phone hidden
in her flat. It's a burner.

02:00.066 --> 02:02.444
No way of seeing the text
messages or e-mails.

02:02.445 --> 02:04.164
Only three messages received,

02:04.165 --> 02:06.345
all from one encrypted number.

02:06.346 --> 02:08.425
The tech boys are trying to crack it.

02:08.425 --> 02:09.900
If they do...

02:10.506 --> 02:12.706
...we have a direct line
to the traffickers.

02:13.986 --> 02:17.420
Question then is, do we want to use it?

02:20.826 --> 02:21.906
Pay the ransom?

02:26.426 --> 02:28.340
This is just really risky, Tosh.

02:30.186 --> 02:34.865
If we call them, and then they panic,

02:34.866 --> 02:36.900
then they could kill both the girls.

02:38.906 --> 02:41.825
Oh, Billy, what's that face? What? What?

02:41.826 --> 02:43.906
Rosie from the caravans has just called.

02:45.146 --> 02:48.100
Says Jamie's been abducted
by Olivia Lennox.

02:52.266 --> 02:53.346
Jesus.

03:01.306 --> 03:02.825
Right, Billy.

03:02.826 --> 03:05.025
Get Rosie in here. I want to talk to her.

03:05.026 --> 03:07.545
Get a description of the car
out on local radio,

03:07.546 --> 03:09.666
and tell everybody to
keep their eye out for it.

03:15.506 --> 03:17.705
Leave a message and I'll get back to you.

03:17.706 --> 03:20.105
Olivia, this is Jimmy Perez.

03:20.106 --> 03:23.145
Bring Jamie Hayes to the station, now.

03:23.146 --> 03:25.180
You are not helping your daughter.

03:44.826 --> 03:45.946
What happened?

03:50.866 --> 03:52.466
I didn't think she was that ill.

03:56.106 --> 03:57.546
I didn't.

03:59.666 --> 04:02.145
- I'd have done something...
- You knew.

04:02.146 --> 04:04.826
- And you could have saved her...
- You, shut your mouth.

04:06.226 --> 04:07.745
Need to get her out of here.

04:07.746 --> 04:09.665
Leave her alone! Don't you touch her.

04:09.666 --> 04:10.940
Shut it!

04:11.586 --> 04:12.826
You'll be next!

04:32.266 --> 04:33.346
Hi, Rosie.

04:34.706 --> 04:37.740
Do you have any idea where
Olivia might have taken him?

04:38.466 --> 04:40.825
No, I have no idea.

04:40.826 --> 04:42.825
Well, how did she seem to you?

04:42.826 --> 04:44.340
I couldn't tell.

04:44.986 --> 04:47.220
You don't think
she's going to hurt him, do you?

04:47.706 --> 04:49.665
I mean, she's got a screw loose.

04:49.666 --> 04:51.505
And he can't defend himself,

04:51.506 --> 04:52.865
not with his injuries.

04:52.866 --> 04:54.305
No, don't worry, Rosie.

04:54.306 --> 04:56.826
She just wants her daughter back.

04:57.866 --> 04:59.506
But we'll find them, soon enough.

05:08.346 --> 05:10.020
OK, this is important.

05:11.066 --> 05:13.020
If you lie to me now...

05:14.132 --> 05:15.572
...everything changes.

05:19.706 --> 05:22.425
You need to talk to Aaron McGuire.

05:22.426 --> 05:24.585
- I just do the inking...
- No, I don't believe you.

05:24.586 --> 05:25.985
I can't tell you what I don't know.

05:25.986 --> 05:27.620
Then tell me what you do know.

05:32.866 --> 05:34.826
And you can protect me if I do?

05:36.466 --> 05:37.506
From who?

05:40.266 --> 05:41.986
We're just the tip of the iceberg.

05:43.866 --> 05:46.345
There's people out there
that I've never even met.

05:46.346 --> 05:47.820
But they know me.

05:48.626 --> 05:50.780
And they'll know
where to find me, if I talk.

05:51.546 --> 05:53.260
I can't make you any promises.

05:57.746 --> 06:01.625
The encrypted number on the phone
we found in your flat,

06:01.626 --> 06:02.940
was that McGuire's?

06:04.946 --> 06:05.986
Yeah.

06:07.552 --> 06:09.752
Is Zezi Ugara still in Shetland?

06:11.866 --> 06:13.145
As far as I know.

06:13.146 --> 06:14.986
And the other girl? What's her name?

06:17.466 --> 06:18.620
Niki.

06:19.266 --> 06:20.506
Where are they?

06:21.906 --> 06:24.545
McGuire'll have panicked
after I was picked up.

06:24.546 --> 06:25.945
I mean, they could be anywhere.

06:25.946 --> 06:28.066
No, last chance. Where are they?

06:31.666 --> 06:34.146
I don't know the address.
I could show you on a map.

06:41.346 --> 06:43.906
What's McGuire planning
to do with Zezi now?

06:45.826 --> 06:49.545
If the family don't pay, and
he can't get her off the island,

06:49.546 --> 06:50.946
he'll kill her.

06:55.199 --> 06:56.919
Right, how long have we got?

06:58.546 --> 07:00.306
Hours, rather than days.

07:38.706 --> 07:40.226
Sandy, move around the front.

07:53.226 --> 07:54.266
Right.

08:02.186 --> 08:03.346
Tosh, check down here.

09:45.546 --> 09:46.906
There's nobody down here.

09:52.586 --> 09:55.466
You need to see something, out the back.

10:18.466 --> 10:19.506
Ah...

10:21.266 --> 10:22.506
That's Niki.

10:29.626 --> 10:30.826
Bastards!

10:35.626 --> 10:37.425
It's on the road to Wester Skeld.

10:37.426 --> 10:39.025
We need the owner's name.

10:39.026 --> 10:42.345
It's registered to
Hunter Holiday Rentals.

10:42.346 --> 10:44.185
Hunter, as in Duncan?

10:44.186 --> 10:46.825
Aye, it's one of his. Are you
going to tell him, or will I?

10:46.826 --> 10:49.380
No, it's fine, I'll do it.

10:53.666 --> 10:54.706
Sir.

10:56.186 --> 10:57.346
Duncan owns it.

11:03.546 --> 11:06.060
You got a holiday let at Wester Skeld?

11:06.666 --> 11:08.265
I do, aye.

11:08.266 --> 11:12.900
It's, erm, not the crown jewel
in my empire, to be honest.

11:13.626 --> 11:14.865
Who's renting it?

11:14.866 --> 11:16.305
Er, nobody.

11:16.306 --> 11:17.785
It's been empty for ages.

11:17.786 --> 11:19.265
It needs too much work done.

11:19.266 --> 11:20.746
OK, who knew it was empty?

11:22.146 --> 11:23.825
Mary and Joanne, from the office.

11:23.826 --> 11:24.865
Anybody else?

11:24.866 --> 11:26.705
No, why? Is there a problem?

11:26.706 --> 11:29.220
Cos we've found a body on the premises.

11:30.106 --> 11:32.546
Young girl that used to work
at the Macbay Hotel.

11:34.386 --> 11:36.506
When was the last time
you were over there?

11:37.506 --> 11:39.020
I...

11:39.466 --> 11:40.985
...I don't know. A month ago?

11:40.986 --> 11:43.385
- And there was nobody there?
- No, I told you.

11:43.386 --> 11:46.025
Don't give me that look,
like you don't believe me!

11:46.026 --> 11:47.066
Not again.

11:50.586 --> 11:52.593
Has Graham Benson been
in contact with you?

11:52.618 --> 11:53.630
No.

11:53.631 --> 11:56.145
So, if I looked in your phone,
I wouldn't find his number in it?

11:56.146 --> 11:58.865
I don't know. I've got
a lot of missed calls.

11:58.866 --> 12:00.345
I owe money to half the island,

12:00.346 --> 12:02.700
so I'm not answering
unless I know who it is.

12:06.786 --> 12:09.305
You better not be getting into bed
with these people, Duncan.

12:09.306 --> 12:10.506
I swear to God.

12:12.666 --> 12:14.745
I want all the details on that property.

12:14.746 --> 12:16.506
And I mean everything, today.

12:26.066 --> 12:28.945
There's coppers all over
the island, looking for us.

12:28.946 --> 12:30.425
Roadblocks.

12:30.426 --> 12:32.020
I just need to dump this van!

12:44.306 --> 12:46.066
We found Niki at the house.

12:47.226 --> 12:48.426
She's dead.

12:53.186 --> 12:54.226
Is that it?

12:56.026 --> 12:57.066
Nothing to say?

12:59.906 --> 13:01.860
What is wrong with you?

13:03.386 --> 13:05.305
There's a young woman just been murdered,

13:05.306 --> 13:07.185
and they threw her body out the back,

13:07.186 --> 13:08.825
like it was a bag of rubbish!

13:08.826 --> 13:10.385
She was ill.

13:10.386 --> 13:11.745
She was ill, how?

13:11.746 --> 13:13.705
She'd had a miscarriage on the way here.

13:13.706 --> 13:17.105
I don't think she'd recovered.
She was bleeding a lot.

13:17.106 --> 13:18.586
Did you get her a doctor?

13:21.546 --> 13:22.705
It was too dangerous.

13:22.706 --> 13:24.865
You could have dropped her at hospital.

13:24.866 --> 13:27.706
You could have done something.
I just did what I was told.

13:28.786 --> 13:30.020
So did McGuire.

13:34.546 --> 13:36.306
Any news on Olivia and Jamie?

13:37.546 --> 13:41.785
We have a sighting of
a blue Suzuki, travelling north.

13:41.786 --> 13:43.705
She could be heading to the North Isles?

13:43.706 --> 13:46.945
No, Olivia doesn't know Shetland
well enough to do that.

13:46.946 --> 13:50.665
There's no sign of her on
any of the inter-island ferries.

13:50.666 --> 13:52.666
I'm guessing she parked up someplace.

13:56.106 --> 13:58.345
Tosh, go and check the guest house.

13:58.346 --> 13:59.820
For what?

14:00.306 --> 14:03.266
For anything that points to
where she might have taken him.

14:10.346 --> 14:12.865
How are you feeling about
this PIRC interview, Sandy?

14:12.866 --> 14:14.460
Are you ready for that?

14:15.266 --> 14:18.340
I'm ready to see my chances of
promotion go down the drain.

14:18.706 --> 14:21.266
That's if I'm not charged
with negligence, first.

14:23.346 --> 14:25.505
Right, well, try not to
let it distract you.

14:25.506 --> 14:28.546
We've got four murder victims
and a missing girl on our hands.

14:30.866 --> 14:33.425
Did she ask about the other islands?

14:33.426 --> 14:34.985
How to get anywhere?

14:34.986 --> 14:37.620
No, she's been
keeping herself to herself.

14:40.106 --> 14:41.665
What's up with the loo?

14:41.666 --> 14:42.865
It's blocked.

14:42.866 --> 14:43.945
The sink, as well.

14:43.946 --> 14:45.860
Got someone coming to have a look.

14:46.346 --> 14:48.505
Miss Lennox has been using
the bathroom downstairs.

14:48.506 --> 14:50.380
- Since when?
- A few days.

15:31.106 --> 15:32.866
Looks like it could be the murder weapon.

15:34.186 --> 15:36.740
It was blocking a drain
at the back of the guesthouse.

15:38.586 --> 15:39.785
Has Cora checked this?

15:39.786 --> 15:41.665
Yeah, it's been cleaned. No prints.

15:41.666 --> 15:42.985
But there are traces of blood.

15:42.986 --> 15:45.786
She's checking to see if they're
a match for Prentice or Carla.

15:47.466 --> 15:49.465
And there's something else.

15:49.466 --> 15:53.025
After I found this, the receptionist
admitted that she wasn't

15:53.026 --> 15:55.820
entirely honest,
when she gave Olivia an alibi.

15:56.946 --> 15:58.385
I know.

15:58.386 --> 16:00.688
She didn't want the owner to know
that she was in one of the spare

16:00.689 --> 16:03.345
rooms with her boyfriend
most of the night.

16:03.346 --> 16:04.585
She didn't see Olivia,

16:04.586 --> 16:07.380
which means we don't know when
she got to the Hayes' place.

16:21.866 --> 16:22.946
OK.

16:25.666 --> 16:27.345
It looks as though

16:27.346 --> 16:31.226
Olivia Lennox's alibi for
the Hayes murders isn't holding up.

16:32.306 --> 16:36.186
So, we now have to assume that she
may be planning to harm Jamie Hayes.

16:37.386 --> 16:41.065
We're going to need roadblocks
on every road north to south.

16:41.066 --> 16:45.345
Tell Willie at Brae, if he wants to
use volunteers, that's fine by me.

16:45.346 --> 16:47.665
We'll take whoever wants to help.

16:47.666 --> 16:48.746
This arrived.

16:50.506 --> 16:53.420
It's Olivia's file from the
Wandsworth Social Work Department.

16:55.906 --> 16:58.706
When she was younger, she attacked
her stepbrother with a knife.

17:21.665 --> 17:23.944
I was just wanting to pick
your brains about...

17:23.945 --> 17:25.099
...working on the rigs.

17:26.665 --> 17:28.665
Well, the money's good.

17:28.666 --> 17:30.305
Why, do you fancy it?

17:30.306 --> 17:32.265
Well, I just, erm...

17:32.266 --> 17:34.300
Think I need to get away for a while.

17:37.066 --> 17:40.065
You know they found
a body at one of my properties?

17:40.066 --> 17:41.266
What?

17:43.192 --> 17:45.340
- When did this happen?
- This morning.

17:46.666 --> 17:48.065
That's horrendous.

17:48.066 --> 17:50.745
It just... It feels like
everything's getting on top of me.

17:50.746 --> 17:52.740
I just... I feel like
I need a break, you know.

17:54.746 --> 17:58.945
Well, don't even think about
roughnecking, cos that is tough.

17:58.946 --> 18:00.586
Especially at our age.

18:01.706 --> 18:03.546
To be honest,
I'm thinking I might pack it in.

18:05.186 --> 18:08.705
I'm not sure I should leave
Alice alone at the moment,

18:08.706 --> 18:10.026
with the way things are.

18:12.426 --> 18:13.506
No?

18:15.439 --> 18:18.260
Was Alice round at Jimmy's place
when I was on Yell?

18:20.586 --> 18:23.385
Erm, well,
she dropped a book off, I think.

18:23.386 --> 18:24.905
Any other time?

18:24.906 --> 18:26.500
No, not that I can remember.

18:29.586 --> 18:31.065
Yeah, I mean, this...

18:31.066 --> 18:34.586
It might just be a case of the grass
is always greener. But, erm...

18:36.506 --> 18:38.425
She talks about him a lot.

18:38.426 --> 18:40.105
Well, they're old pals, you know.

18:40.106 --> 18:41.946
I don't know what I'd do if she left me.

18:44.346 --> 18:45.825
I really don't.

18:45.826 --> 18:47.985
Come on, that's not going to happen!

18:47.986 --> 18:50.265
Alice is just settling in, you know.

18:50.266 --> 18:52.225
I mean, you're used to moving around.

18:52.226 --> 18:53.586
It's different for her.

18:56.226 --> 18:57.266
Aye, aye.

18:58.426 --> 18:59.626
Maybe you're right.

19:01.586 --> 19:02.666
Thanks for the drink.

19:03.906 --> 19:05.666
- I better head. See you later.
- Aye.

19:22.546 --> 19:23.660
Good luck.

19:24.506 --> 19:25.706
Looks like I'll need it.

19:27.012 --> 19:28.052
OK, listen.

19:29.332 --> 19:34.692
Nobody, least of all me, thinks
you were negligent in Calum's death,

19:34.985 --> 19:38.505
and when I speak to them,
I will back you all the way.

19:41.706 --> 19:42.786
Thank you.

19:43.786 --> 19:45.066
That means a lot.

19:46.546 --> 19:48.546
Sorry. You need to hear something.

19:56.026 --> 19:59.905
There was a guy down at the plant
threatening Mr Laird.

19:59.906 --> 20:01.426
It was getting pretty heated.

20:02.425 --> 20:06.905
And it was odd, it felt like
I recognised him from somewhere,

20:06.946 --> 20:10.105
but I can't remember where.

20:10.106 --> 20:11.620
What'd he look like?

20:12.426 --> 20:14.385
Quite tall. Grey beard.

20:14.386 --> 20:16.180
Sort of dark eyes.

20:19.626 --> 20:20.980
Is that him?

20:21.266 --> 20:22.980
Yeah. Yeah, that's him.

20:25.666 --> 20:26.746
Right.

20:37.226 --> 20:39.140
Remember, every nook and cranny.

20:45.866 --> 20:48.105
Don't you think
this is a bit unnecessary?

20:48.106 --> 20:50.465
You tell me why you've never
mentioned your connection

20:50.466 --> 20:53.145
to Aaron McGuire and then
I'll decide for myself.

20:53.146 --> 20:55.785
Because I don't know
anyone called McGuire.

20:55.786 --> 20:57.626
Well, maybe you knew him as Paul Kiernan?

20:59.306 --> 21:00.260
Kiernan?

21:01.179 --> 21:03.979
Sure. I used to drink with him
at the MacBay Hotel.

21:05.586 --> 21:06.785
Just had word.

21:06.786 --> 21:09.546
They've found bags of lye
in the garage back at his place.

21:10.946 --> 21:12.745
Is that significant?

21:12.746 --> 21:14.825
Och, do you know what,
I don't have time for this.

21:14.826 --> 21:17.167
Gavin Laird, I'm arresting you
on suspicion of having

21:17.168 --> 21:20.020
committed a crime.
I need you to come with me now.

21:21.146 --> 21:22.186
What?

21:29.266 --> 21:31.060
There's nothing out here.

21:31.786 --> 21:33.385
Look, we're going round in circles.

21:33.386 --> 21:35.505
We've been driving for hours.

21:35.506 --> 21:37.186
This road doesn't even go anywhere!

21:40.426 --> 21:42.385
What are you doing?

21:42.386 --> 21:43.545
Stop!

21:43.546 --> 21:45.065
You can't drive out here! Stop!

21:45.066 --> 21:47.025
Please, stop!
What are you doing? Stop the car!

21:47.026 --> 21:48.465
Stop! Stop! Stop!

21:48.466 --> 21:50.745
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

21:53.186 --> 21:54.466
Argh!

22:02.306 --> 22:03.546
Stay there!

22:11.626 --> 22:13.825
Tell me where my daughter is.

22:13.826 --> 22:16.020
I told you, I don't know anything!

22:16.786 --> 22:18.426
Argh!

22:20.946 --> 22:25.345
Now, just so you know, the fiscal's
keen that I charge you with murder,

22:25.346 --> 22:26.825
and I think she's got a point.

22:26.826 --> 22:29.025
Why? I didn't kill anyone.

22:29.026 --> 22:32.465
Industrial lye, traces of which
were found on Daniel Ugara's body,

22:32.466 --> 22:33.945
was found in your possession.

22:33.946 --> 22:37.665
You were also seen talking to Aaron
McGuire, a known people trafficker.

22:37.666 --> 22:40.025
That lye was there
when I bought the place.

22:40.026 --> 22:41.185
It's been there for years.

22:41.186 --> 22:43.986
And what about McGuire?
Why were you talking to him earlier?

22:45.506 --> 22:48.100
If you're going to lie,
you need to think faster than that.

22:48.626 --> 22:50.603
So, were you working for him?
Was he working for you?

22:50.628 --> 22:51.626
Neither.

22:51.627 --> 22:54.345
Look we've got the CCTV from
your plant, and we have people who

22:54.346 --> 22:56.666
can lip read, so we'll know exactly
what you were saying.

23:00.346 --> 23:02.945
He wanted to borrow one of our vans.

23:02.946 --> 23:06.865
I presumed so he could
get off the island undetected.

23:06.866 --> 23:08.505
I told him I couldn't do that.

23:08.506 --> 23:09.940
And why come to you for help?

23:11.346 --> 23:13.945
We'd do each other the odd favour.

23:13.946 --> 23:16.425
That's how it works here, you know that.

23:16.426 --> 23:19.185
And you didn't think that was
important enough to call us?

23:19.186 --> 23:21.265
I didn't want to get involved.

23:21.266 --> 23:22.826
I've got enough on my plate.

23:25.826 --> 23:28.145
Did McGuire kill Daniel Ugara?

23:28.146 --> 23:29.860
Why would I know that?

23:30.986 --> 23:34.146
The only thing I can tell you about
Mr Ugara is he threatened me.

23:35.346 --> 23:37.345
He said he would tell
the authorities I was using

23:37.346 --> 23:40.145
trafficked workers unless I told him
what I knew about his sister.

23:40.146 --> 23:41.745
- And what did you know?
- Nothing!

23:41.746 --> 23:44.100
I don't use trafficked workers.

23:46.006 --> 23:47.326
But...

23:47.426 --> 23:49.625
...I knew if anyone searched
the plant, they'd find

23:49.626 --> 23:50.865
the second pipeline.

23:50.866 --> 23:52.945
Is that the one you didn't use?

23:52.946 --> 23:55.745
Yeah, well, I lied about that, obviously.

23:55.746 --> 23:58.020
Right, so why should we believe you now?

23:59.772 --> 24:02.892
I just told him to get on his bike.

24:02.917 --> 24:04.477
That's all.

24:04.506 --> 24:06.420
I didn't touch him.

24:10.946 --> 24:14.220
Jamie's car's been spotted heading
towards the cliffs up by Eshaness.

24:33.746 --> 24:35.700
You know what I don't understand?

24:36.506 --> 24:39.425
Why aren't you looking for
the people that killed your family?

24:39.426 --> 24:41.985
- Like I am?
- Because I don't know who killed them.

24:41.986 --> 24:43.980
You're not even trying, though, are you?

24:44.546 --> 24:46.505
Makes me think you know things.

24:46.506 --> 24:48.105
I don't!

24:48.106 --> 24:49.545
You lie to me one more time,

24:49.546 --> 24:52.585
I'm going to drive us
off the edge of this fucking cliff!

24:52.586 --> 24:55.100
I don't know!
Please, please! I don't know.

25:02.346 --> 25:04.305
For all I know, you...

25:04.306 --> 25:05.506
...you might have killed her.

25:08.026 --> 25:09.705
Me?

25:09.706 --> 25:11.865
Why are you saying that?

25:11.866 --> 25:14.025
Then tell me something different.

25:14.026 --> 25:16.185
I can't. I don't know anything.

25:16.186 --> 25:18.825
You have ten seconds to tell me
where my daughter is,

25:18.826 --> 25:20.826
or I'm driving us both over the edge!

25:21.876 --> 25:22.996
I don't want to die.

25:24.316 --> 25:25.955
I don't want to die.

25:25.956 --> 25:27.116
Please...

25:31.516 --> 25:33.235
I don't care.

25:33.236 --> 25:34.396
I don't care any more!

25:37.756 --> 25:41.555
Prentice saw people
being landed up near here.

25:41.556 --> 25:42.995
He knew what McGuire was doing.

25:42.996 --> 25:47.020
He saw them being
transported to the hotel.

25:48.476 --> 25:51.795
He told McGuire
he wanted money to keep him...

25:51.796 --> 25:52.835
...to keep him quiet.

25:52.836 --> 25:54.675
- And Daniel?
- I don't know.

25:54.676 --> 25:55.996
Maybe he saw the same thing.

25:58.036 --> 26:00.595
Maybe that's why he was killed.

26:00.596 --> 26:02.195
I don't know.

26:02.196 --> 26:05.580
Olivia, I don't, I don't.

26:07.036 --> 26:09.235
You pull on the hand brake!

26:09.236 --> 26:12.155
Pull on the hand brake
and turn the engine off now!

26:12.156 --> 26:16.300
If I can't save my girl
I might as well be dead!

26:19.876 --> 26:22.756
Look, we've got new information,
Olivia. We're getting close.

26:23.916 --> 26:25.236
We're getting close.

26:27.956 --> 26:29.916
I will find your daughter.

26:32.156 --> 26:34.076
I swear I'll find her.

26:44.316 --> 26:45.556
I swear it.

27:10.676 --> 27:12.275
I thought you were at the house?

27:12.276 --> 27:14.500
No, I was meeting with Duncan today.

27:15.436 --> 27:16.516
I did say.

27:17.996 --> 27:19.236
Ah, that you did.

27:20.396 --> 27:21.716
Sorry.

27:29.716 --> 27:31.680
- I hate that.
- What?

27:33.596 --> 27:35.436
When you just stand there and watch.

27:36.996 --> 27:38.676
You could help me with this, please.

27:46.116 --> 27:48.156
- Is it for real?
- Is what for real?

27:49.996 --> 27:51.516
The way you feel about Perez?

27:57.636 --> 27:59.236
You can take as long as you want.

28:09.076 --> 28:11.596
My feelings for Jimmy are
what they've always been.

28:13.596 --> 28:15.516
I saw you together, in the bar.

28:17.356 --> 28:19.715
He wanted my advice on his case.

28:19.716 --> 28:21.036
Again?

28:22.956 --> 28:24.555
Why are you helping him, really?

28:24.556 --> 28:26.316
Because it's the right thing to do.

28:27.556 --> 28:30.315
I want to be part of this community.
Isn't that the idea?

28:30.316 --> 28:31.716
- Not if it ruins us.
- Us?

28:33.036 --> 28:35.115
Ruins us?

28:35.116 --> 28:36.420
Are you serious?

28:38.116 --> 28:39.516
You're never here, Chris.

28:41.036 --> 28:43.820
I mean, even if what you think is true...

28:45.596 --> 28:47.555
...who'd blame me?

28:47.556 --> 28:49.755
You're either on the rigs
or at the house on Yell...

28:49.756 --> 28:51.435
I am trying to build a future for us.

28:51.436 --> 28:53.580
By accusing me of having an affair!

28:54.996 --> 28:56.980
That's how you build our future?

28:59.556 --> 29:01.636
You're just digging a hole
to bury our marriage in!

29:21.116 --> 29:23.315
My people have been
running around all over the place,

29:23.316 --> 29:26.155
looking for you, when they should
have been looking for your daughter.

29:26.156 --> 29:27.196
Do you realise that?

29:40.116 --> 29:41.876
- I read your social work file.
- Oh...

29:51.876 --> 29:53.700
When your mother died,

29:54.556 --> 29:58.140
you went to live with
your stepfather and his son...

30:00.116 --> 30:03.275
...and you attacked
your stepbrother with a knife.

30:03.276 --> 30:05.440
- You want to talk to me about that?
- No.

30:09.316 --> 30:11.060
There must have been a reason.

30:12.316 --> 30:15.075
It was in the past, what has it
got to do with any of this?

30:15.076 --> 30:16.875
Because the Hayes
were killed with a knife.

30:16.876 --> 30:18.256
That's what it's got to do with this.

30:18.257 --> 30:21.716
Ah, so that is my
weapon of choice now, is it?

30:28.236 --> 30:29.756
You know, your file...

30:31.716 --> 30:37.636
...is just a list of
self-destructive behaviour.

30:37.888 --> 30:39.128
You lash out...

30:40.036 --> 30:42.820
...at anything and anyone...

30:46.156 --> 30:50.004
...and the only thing
that's missing is...

30:50.029 --> 30:51.789
Why?

30:54.636 --> 30:56.436
Because I was angry.

31:00.636 --> 31:02.876
Because no-one believed me.

31:11.116 --> 31:13.596
They passed me between themselves.

31:15.316 --> 31:18.436
And when I was 11 years old...

31:19.796 --> 31:25.795
...and the social just saw me
as someone who got pregnant,

31:25.796 --> 31:29.380
who got into trouble,
they didn't care why.

31:33.495 --> 31:34.935
I'm sorry.

31:39.556 --> 31:43.316
I can't imagine that's
something you ever get over.

31:45.036 --> 31:47.340
Lucky you only have to imagine it, then.

31:51.756 --> 31:54.995
So did you think that
the same thing was going to happen

31:54.996 --> 31:56.876
to Daniel and Zezi?

32:02.556 --> 32:04.180
I saw it coming.

32:07.116 --> 32:08.436
I didn't know what to do.

32:12.636 --> 32:13.916
I haven't...

32:17.316 --> 32:18.596
I haven't loved...

32:21.516 --> 32:22.836
...anything...

32:25.396 --> 32:27.420
...apart from those two.

32:33.876 --> 32:34.996
So...

32:36.316 --> 32:40.075
...is that why you let
the social workers take them away,

32:40.076 --> 32:42.260
because you wanted to protect them?

32:45.836 --> 32:47.275
They said I was violent.

32:55.036 --> 32:58.235
They said there was a cycle of abuse

32:58.236 --> 33:00.276
that needed to be broken.

33:04.476 --> 33:06.300
I think they had a point.

33:07.356 --> 33:08.860
I mean...

33:10.276 --> 33:12.795
...the abused becomes the abuser, right?

33:12.796 --> 33:16.195
No, that's, no,
that's not always the case.

33:16.196 --> 33:18.555
Man, it doesn't matter about me.

33:18.556 --> 33:21.916
I mean, it was just about
making them safe, so...

33:28.996 --> 33:30.820
I gave them up...

33:32.556 --> 33:33.956
...to keep them safe.

33:38.342 --> 33:40.342
But they weren't safe.

33:46.369 --> 33:47.849
I thought...

33:52.556 --> 33:56.500
I thought saving Zezi would
make me stop hating myself.

34:01.122 --> 34:02.362
It won't.

34:05.276 --> 34:06.676
It won't.

34:12.876 --> 34:15.315
I did stab my stepbrother, yeah.

34:16.556 --> 34:17.915
And I admit that.

34:17.916 --> 34:19.675
I went at him.

34:19.676 --> 34:20.755
I really did.

34:21.916 --> 34:24.699
Because I was protecting my kids.

34:28.716 --> 34:30.556
I didn't kill the Hayes.

34:31.835 --> 34:33.034
You know, if they...

34:34.235 --> 34:36.795
...harmed Daniel,
I am glad they are dead.

34:36.795 --> 34:38.196
But I did not kill them.

34:43.556 --> 34:44.916
I didn't.

34:52.828 --> 34:53.868
OK.

35:02.636 --> 35:04.315
What are we charging her with?

35:04.316 --> 35:05.635
I'm not charging her.

35:05.636 --> 35:06.956
She abducted Jamie.

35:08.276 --> 35:10.635
I know. I'm not charging her.

35:10.636 --> 35:11.675
OK.

35:15.716 --> 35:17.340
Alice.

35:17.676 --> 35:19.860
Chris knows how I feel about you.

35:22.236 --> 35:23.396
He's walked out.

35:24.876 --> 35:26.516
Are you...? Are you OK?

35:27.516 --> 35:29.756
Well, to be honest, I'm relieved.

35:32.236 --> 35:33.956
We should meet up later.

35:35.636 --> 35:36.676
I'd like that.

35:38.916 --> 35:41.556
OK. I'll call you when I finish up.

35:42.100 --> 35:43.315
Bye.

35:43.316 --> 35:44.876
Bye.

36:02.928 --> 36:04.088
Alice.

36:06.596 --> 36:08.900
You're getting yourself into something?

36:09.676 --> 36:12.876
- I... I don't want to talk about that.
- Maybe you should.

36:20.788 --> 36:23.788
I don't want to be the guy
that breaks up a relationship.

36:29.556 --> 36:31.196
Well, in my experience...

36:33.202 --> 36:37.522
...if she feels the same way
about you, it's already broken.

36:39.796 --> 36:41.875
- I think that's pretty good.
- No, it's awful.

36:41.876 --> 36:44.795
- Has it not got 20...?
- No, but, seriously, level 340?

36:44.796 --> 36:46.435
What level are we on?

36:46.436 --> 36:48.435
Like, 600 and something.

36:48.436 --> 36:50.435
I don't believe you, let me see it.

36:50.436 --> 36:51.795
Later, I need to pack.

36:51.796 --> 36:53.475
Pack? Where are you going?

36:53.476 --> 36:55.755
I'm not hanging around here any longer.

36:55.756 --> 36:57.756
You want to tell Jimmy, or will I?

37:06.876 --> 37:10.515
You know what Jamie told Olivia
about the landings at Eswick?

37:10.516 --> 37:13.875
I've checked those employment
files from Claire McGuire's agency

37:13.876 --> 37:15.515
in Glasgow, and there's a pattern.

37:15.516 --> 37:17.755
New arrivals at the same time
every month,

37:17.756 --> 37:20.860
which means there must be a regular
landing just before that, right?

37:21.516 --> 37:24.236
- Which would be when?
- About now.

37:25.276 --> 37:27.235
They might have closed the pipeline,
but if not,

37:27.236 --> 37:28.716
we could be there waiting for them.

37:30.936 --> 37:33.496
Right, let's get started, shall we?

37:33.676 --> 37:35.553
What we're looking at this afternoon

37:35.554 --> 37:38.940
is the events before and after
the death of Calum Dunwoody.

37:40.396 --> 37:44.115
We've established that
you did a risk assessment.

37:44.116 --> 37:47.860
Can I ask how Mr Dunwoody appeared
before he was taken to the cell?

37:49.215 --> 37:52.855
I'd say he seemed subdued.

37:54.356 --> 37:59.230
Did he request to speak to anyone?
His lawyer, for instance?

37:59.255 --> 38:00.295
No.

38:01.436 --> 38:05.556
His wife? Did he say,
"Tell her I love her"?

38:07.516 --> 38:09.220
As I recall, yes.

38:10.195 --> 38:12.100
What did you think when he said that?

38:12.996 --> 38:14.220
How do you mean?

38:14.842 --> 38:17.842
Do people often ask you to
pass on messages like that?

38:17.956 --> 38:19.540
Sometimes.

38:20.036 --> 38:23.435
If they've been drinking,
or under stress.

38:23.436 --> 38:26.060
Had Mr Dunwoody been drinking?

38:27.196 --> 38:28.236
No.

38:40.396 --> 38:42.315
Here comes the cavalry.

38:42.316 --> 38:44.595
No, I just... I want to talk.

38:44.596 --> 38:46.915
I need to get on with my life.

38:46.916 --> 38:48.155
I've got classes.

38:48.156 --> 38:49.380
There's stuff I need to do.

38:50.116 --> 38:52.075
Right, you need to get back to
the station

38:52.076 --> 38:53.716
and tell PC Kirk to get down here.

38:58.196 --> 39:00.555
A few days isn't going to hurt you,
is it?

39:00.556 --> 39:03.260
It's my decision, Dad, not yours.

39:04.436 --> 39:06.556
OK, I'm on the ferry tomorrow.

39:20.356 --> 39:21.636
Don't worry.

39:23.436 --> 39:26.356
I'll get her some protection
till this is over.

39:29.076 --> 39:31.036
What about the next time?

39:33.596 --> 39:35.664
You ever think about
taking early retirement?

39:35.665 --> 39:38.220
Dodge can always find another Sheriff.

39:38.796 --> 39:41.274
I'll sing, "Do not forsake me
Oh, my darling"

39:41.275 --> 39:46.580
while you gallop off
into the sunset with Alice.

39:49.516 --> 39:51.276
What's that supposed to mean?

39:56.596 --> 39:59.900
Chris has been asking me
a lot of questions about you two.

40:00.676 --> 40:02.595
I told him there was
nothing to worry about,

40:02.596 --> 40:04.500
but it doesn't feel right lying to him.

40:06.076 --> 40:08.940
And I am lying to him, amn't I?

40:11.396 --> 40:12.515
I really...

40:12.516 --> 40:15.956
I really hadn't expected to feel
this way about somebody ever again.

40:18.116 --> 40:19.876
Taken me by surprise, if I'm honest.

40:24.516 --> 40:26.660
As far as Cassie goes,

40:27.636 --> 40:31.116
I'm more than aware of how
my job has impacted on her life.

40:31.700 --> 40:36.980
But you've got some brass neck
on you, Duncan, seriously...

40:38.596 --> 40:40.556
...after everything
you've put her through.

40:42.116 --> 40:44.476
You've done more than your fair share.

41:00.036 --> 41:02.835
- Can I speak to you for a minute?
- Sorry, Chris. I don't have the time.

41:02.836 --> 41:05.636
I just need to know
what's going on with you and Alice.

41:05.637 --> 41:07.460
Right, there's nothing's going on.

41:08.596 --> 41:09.956
Would you like it to?

41:11.356 --> 41:12.755
Oh. Hesitation.

41:12.756 --> 41:13.916
Two points to me.

41:16.836 --> 41:18.599
Look, I've answered your question.

41:18.600 --> 41:20.891
The thing is,
I don't want to get in the way

41:20.892 --> 41:23.395
if you two want to be together.

41:23.396 --> 41:25.436
Nobody wants the sympathy vote, do they?

41:38.076 --> 41:40.380
The techies have cracked Andrea's phone.

41:41.156 --> 41:43.693
Do we contact McGuire?
I know you said it was risky, but...

41:43.694 --> 41:45.476
But that was before Niki.

41:47.255 --> 41:48.375
Your call.

41:52.156 --> 41:54.395
- Are you sure about this?
- Mm-hmm.

41:54.396 --> 41:57.595
Olivia makes the call
first thing tomorrow morning.

41:57.596 --> 41:59.082
They set the time and the place

41:59.083 --> 42:01.515
and then when McGuire pitches up,
we move in.

42:01.516 --> 42:03.940
- What if he doesn't take the bait?
- I don't know.

42:04.516 --> 42:07.946
I don't know cos I'm out, Rhona,
I'm all out of ideas,

42:07.947 --> 42:09.533
so if you've got a better one...?

42:09.534 --> 42:13.235
If Zezi knows who's behind this,
what they look like,

42:13.236 --> 42:15.316
why would they release her?

42:17.916 --> 42:21.715
I just think that if they...
if they'd planned to kill her,

42:21.716 --> 42:23.636
I think that she'd be dead already.

42:53.316 --> 42:54.835
I'm sorry I'm late.

42:54.836 --> 42:56.435
You're fine.

42:56.436 --> 42:57.956
Look at that view.

42:59.236 --> 43:00.995
I could stand here all night.

43:00.996 --> 43:02.475
I... I can't stay long.

43:02.476 --> 43:05.155
We're very close to finding Zezi,
I think.

43:05.156 --> 43:06.466
You know where she is?

43:06.467 --> 43:08.556
No, we're going to pay the ransom.

43:09.956 --> 43:12.595
And if that works, and it's a big if,

43:12.596 --> 43:15.595
then we should have her back
in safe hands by tomorrow.

43:15.596 --> 43:17.596
Oh, God, Jimmy, I hope you do.

43:19.676 --> 43:21.715
How about you?

43:21.716 --> 43:23.780
I'm OK, really.

43:25.276 --> 43:27.780
I knew it was wrong
even before we got married.

43:28.476 --> 43:30.836
I thought moving here
might make a difference.

43:32.436 --> 43:35.356
But it was only when I saw
you again, I realised what would.

43:38.036 --> 43:40.155
So waiting a little longer
won't hurt, then?

43:40.156 --> 43:41.700
Oh, it will hurt.

43:43.756 --> 43:45.580
As long as I know that you're there.

43:46.500 --> 43:47.916
I'm not going anywhere.

43:52.036 --> 43:53.916
- I have to go.
- Yes.

44:02.762 --> 44:03.844
Hey...

44:05.102 --> 44:06.702
How did the interview go?

44:09.489 --> 44:10.889
I don't know.

44:12.255 --> 44:15.420
They don't have a case, Sandy,
they just don't.

44:15.956 --> 44:19.860
I mean, what do they expect us
to be, mind readers?

44:20.476 --> 44:22.540
You just can't win in this job.

44:23.836 --> 44:26.060
Well, try not to worry.

44:26.996 --> 44:29.115
And get some sleep.

44:29.116 --> 44:31.476
We've got to keep this place
running tomorrow.

44:37.916 --> 44:39.115
Hi.

44:39.116 --> 44:40.196
Sorry I'm late.

44:43.036 --> 44:44.155
Oh!

44:44.156 --> 44:45.635
That wasn't awkward at all.

44:45.636 --> 44:48.395
No, it was seamless, wasn't it?

44:48.396 --> 44:50.875
- I got you one in.
- Good man.

44:50.876 --> 44:52.475
I wasn't sure I should.

44:52.476 --> 44:55.595
Thought it might look presumptuous,
like you were definitely coming.

44:55.596 --> 44:57.595
Did you think I wasn't going to come?

44:57.596 --> 44:59.275
Why? Did you think about not coming?

44:59.276 --> 45:01.435
Are you always this self-confident?

45:04.862 --> 45:06.142
How's work?

45:07.356 --> 45:10.481
Hellish. I need this. And another.

45:10.482 --> 45:12.353
Oh, you looking for a new job?

45:12.354 --> 45:15.675
Aye. Yeah. Well, there's nothing
going in Shetland, though.

45:15.676 --> 45:17.755
Might have to go back down south.

45:17.756 --> 45:19.476
Well, I mean,
I could take whatever's going.

45:19.477 --> 45:21.996
But I just don't know
why I would do that.

45:25.156 --> 45:26.635
Course.

45:26.636 --> 45:27.977
You're an IT guy.

45:27.978 --> 45:30.875
IT guys have to do IT. It's in the blood.

45:30.876 --> 45:34.555
Exactly. My father was in IT,
and his father before him,

45:34.556 --> 45:36.435
and his father before him.

45:36.436 --> 45:39.596
The shame it would bring
on the family name!

45:59.956 --> 46:01.475
Look.

46:01.476 --> 46:02.955
The Merrie Dancers.

46:02.956 --> 46:05.236
Did you know that's what
they call the Northern Lights?

46:06.636 --> 46:09.316
Aye, cos I'm from here, remember?

46:15.489 --> 46:16.889
Look...

46:18.316 --> 46:20.155
I'm sorry about what I said earlier.

46:20.156 --> 46:23.260
I'm just, I'm... I'm dead tired.

46:24.076 --> 46:26.756
Well, if it's what you think,
you might as well say it.

46:28.575 --> 46:29.855
OK.

46:31.602 --> 46:34.162
I'm away back inside.
I'll see you in the morning.

46:35.596 --> 46:37.956
Every chance you get, you put me down.

46:39.156 --> 46:41.676
I mean, you've been doing it for years.

46:43.236 --> 46:46.875
And then you accuse me of a crime
that I would never have done.

46:46.876 --> 46:48.955
You put a wedge between me and Mary.

46:48.956 --> 46:51.515
Between me and my son,
me and my daughter.

46:51.516 --> 46:53.399
Och, away, you're pissed, Duncan,
away and get some sleep...

46:53.400 --> 46:55.580
And now you're doing it again.

46:56.556 --> 46:58.635
This time it's...

46:58.636 --> 47:01.820
it's peo... it's people trafficking?!

47:04.796 --> 47:06.995
Well, they did use your property
as a safe house.

47:06.996 --> 47:09.076
Oh, I bet that made your day!

47:14.076 --> 47:15.795
You know,
your son doesn't want to know you

47:15.796 --> 47:17.276
because you didn't want to know him.

47:18.556 --> 47:21.100
And your wife can't take any more lies,

47:22.076 --> 47:25.235
and sure, Cassie might be
being less than sympathetic,

47:25.236 --> 47:28.555
but honestly, what did you expect?

47:28.556 --> 47:29.861
Everything would have been all right

47:29.862 --> 47:31.631
if you hadn't dragged
me through the shit.

47:31.656 --> 47:33.700
This isn't about that.

47:37.956 --> 47:40.515
This is about how you managed to destroy

47:40.516 --> 47:42.996
every single good thing in your life.

47:46.596 --> 47:49.195
There are people who would have
killed to have had what you had.

47:49.196 --> 47:50.516
And I'm one of them.

47:52.236 --> 47:53.915
But you pissed it away.

47:53.916 --> 47:55.356
One lie after another.

48:27.156 --> 48:28.860
Whenever you're ready.

48:50.476 --> 48:52.756
Hello? It's Zezi's mother.

48:56.116 --> 48:57.636
I want to pay.

48:59.116 --> 49:02.076
I have the money. In... in cash.

49:06.496 --> 49:08.616
Just let her go, please.

49:16.940 --> 49:18.875
I said, I've got the money.

49:18.876 --> 49:21.196
How did you get this number?

49:24.836 --> 49:28.140
Daniel. It was in his belongings.

49:31.802 --> 49:33.482
I'll call you back in two minutes.

49:42.540 --> 49:45.076
He says he'll call me back.

49:47.516 --> 49:50.035
Checking with his boss, then?

49:50.036 --> 49:53.036
Maybe. Let's see.

50:04.796 --> 50:06.235
This is a waste of time.

50:06.236 --> 50:09.100
No, just... Let's wait and see.

50:10.556 --> 50:12.756
They don't have many choices.

50:39.716 --> 50:41.115
Hello?

50:41.116 --> 50:43.555
There's an empty byre near Toft.

50:43.556 --> 50:45.395
Ten o'clock.

50:45.396 --> 50:47.716
Bring the money. No-one else.

50:49.182 --> 50:51.142
Your daughter'll be released.

50:52.196 --> 50:53.435
I understand.

51:23.916 --> 51:27.020
OK, heads up. A vehicle approaching.

51:33.956 --> 51:35.596
Yeah, that's the van.

51:55.836 --> 51:57.436
Wait. It's pulled up.

52:12.076 --> 52:13.476
Come on...

52:53.156 --> 52:55.515
He's clocked us! Move! Move!

52:55.516 --> 52:56.796
No!

53:02.996 --> 53:04.636
No!

53:33.596 --> 53:35.236
Come on!

53:40.409 --> 53:41.689
Come on, come on!

53:43.156 --> 53:44.676
He's going to stop, right?

53:46.195 --> 53:47.555
Jesus!

54:08.076 --> 54:09.275
She's not in there.

54:09.276 --> 54:10.836
Ambulance is on its way.

54:20.476 --> 54:22.596
Ah, somebody must have tipped him off.

56:30.836 --> 56:33.916
Help! Help!

56:34.862 --> 56:36.382
I need help here!

56:42.356 --> 56:44.476
Help!
