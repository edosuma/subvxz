WEBVTT

00:00.050 --> 00:01.514
<i>Previously on "The Magicians"...</i>

00:01.634 --> 00:04.027
This contract initiates our
services in exchange for...

00:04.148 --> 00:06.150
Unlimited manual
and magical labor?

00:06.270 --> 00:08.135
You signed that insane contract?

00:08.170 --> 00:10.591
- Yeah, it's okay.
- How the hell is that okay?

00:10.711 --> 00:11.921
Because I get magic back.

00:12.041 --> 00:13.419
Did you do this for me?

00:13.454 --> 00:16.655
I'm Bayler, a proud soldier
of Fillorians United.

00:16.690 --> 00:18.357
We will not rest until

00:18.392 --> 00:20.359
a Fillorian sits
upon the throne.

00:20.394 --> 00:22.428
The fairies can bring back
The Wellspring?

00:22.463 --> 00:24.496
- They can.
- And in return?

00:24.532 --> 00:26.331
A royal child of Whitespire.

00:26.367 --> 00:27.733
We're getting married.

00:27.768 --> 00:30.402
Apparently all monarchs are
entitled to one of each:

00:30.438 --> 00:31.831
<i>a wife and a husband.</i>

00:31.951 --> 00:34.239
Alice, I hope you meant it.

00:34.275 --> 00:38.110
I hope you just go
and do beautiful magic.

00:38.145 --> 00:39.545
<i>Quentin says go free.</i>

00:39.580 --> 00:42.214
<i>You fed him to Reynard.</i>

00:42.249 --> 00:43.415
<i>He knew how to survive.</i>

00:43.451 --> 00:45.584
<i>Yeah, by doing what you want.</i>

00:45.619 --> 00:48.353
<i>That's all you see anymore,
is what you want.</i>

00:48.389 --> 00:50.622
You don't feel
anymore, Julia...

00:50.658 --> 00:52.391
not the way a human does.

00:52.426 --> 00:53.592
Do you remember the gift

00:53.627 --> 00:55.194
that Jane was given in the book

00:55.229 --> 00:56.762
"The Girl Who Told Time"?

00:56.797 --> 00:58.897
<i>Ember gave her the ability
to fuck with time</i>

00:58.933 --> 01:00.432
<i>on a cosmic scale.</i>

01:00.468 --> 01:02.701
<i>Jane used it to create
a time loop.</i>

01:02.736 --> 01:06.305
<i>In each loop,
Jane alters something</i>

01:06.340 --> 01:07.706
to see if it'll
change the outcome.

01:07.741 --> 01:08.819
What's different this time?

01:08.843 --> 01:09.843
I was at Brakebills.

01:09.877 --> 01:10.917
You were supposed to be.

01:10.945 --> 01:13.445
Or you were, like, 39 times.

01:13.481 --> 01:14.847
You were the thing they changed.

01:22.389 --> 01:25.190
Very impressive, Ms. Wicker.

01:25.226 --> 01:26.425
Let me do it again.

01:26.460 --> 01:28.760
I was wondering
what would happen

01:28.796 --> 01:32.731
if I connected the sequence with
Atsuko's Spectral Refraction.

01:32.766 --> 01:33.832
All right.

01:35.000 --> 01:41.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:50.751 --> 01:53.418
That is a second year spell.

01:53.454 --> 01:54.753
I... I read ahead.

01:54.788 --> 01:56.922
More than that, you...

01:56.957 --> 01:59.758
you understood the theory
behind the spell, and--

01:59.793 --> 02:02.394
and you reshaped it.

02:02.429 --> 02:05.197
Your discipline is
meta-composition.

02:05.232 --> 02:07.533
You are a Knowledge student.

02:07.568 --> 02:09.935
- Knowledge?
- Part psychic, part physical.

02:09.970 --> 02:12.571
There really is no branch
it doesn't touch on.

02:12.606 --> 02:14.907
The short version:
you are drawn,

02:14.942 --> 02:18.477
mind and body,
to the discovery of magic.

02:18.512 --> 02:21.246
Is it true that they--
um, well that we--

02:21.282 --> 02:23.348
live in the attic
above the Library?

02:23.384 --> 02:26.818
I assure you it is much more
luxurious than it sounds.

02:26.854 --> 02:28.787
No, I mean, it sounds
like bliss, actually.

02:28.822 --> 02:31.490
I enjoyed it.

02:31.525 --> 02:32.691
You were a Knowledge student?

02:32.726 --> 02:34.259
I am a Knowledge student.

02:34.295 --> 02:36.528
It doesn't end with your degree.

02:36.564 --> 02:38.297
You have a rare gift, Julia,

02:38.332 --> 02:42.534
and I must admit I'm envious
of the many rich discoveries

02:42.570 --> 02:44.403
that you have ahead of you.

02:44.438 --> 02:45.704
Welcome.

02:47.341 --> 02:48.807
Thank you.

03:05.593 --> 03:07.893
You are free to go.

03:07.928 --> 03:09.494
Why would you let me go?

03:09.530 --> 03:11.830
Because, Ms. Wicker,

03:11.865 --> 03:13.599
you are not a student here,

03:13.634 --> 03:15.867
and I'm not running a jail.

03:15.903 --> 03:19.371
Kady locked me up
for a good reason.

03:19.406 --> 03:21.573
I should feel terrible

03:21.609 --> 03:23.008
about what I did.

03:25.312 --> 03:27.879
But I don't.

03:27.915 --> 03:30.749
I just think it's terrible,

03:30.784 --> 03:34.419
and I think I would've never
done it if I were me.

03:34.455 --> 03:36.888
One thing I've learned
about you, Ms. Wicker,

03:36.924 --> 03:39.491
is that you are a searcher.

03:42.363 --> 03:44.029
You don't know me.

03:44.064 --> 03:47.599
39 times I've known you.

03:47.635 --> 03:50.469
Which is why I trust that
you'll put aside your fear

03:50.504 --> 03:52.471
and self-pity

03:52.506 --> 03:55.540
and look for the answers
that can save you.

04:00.414 --> 04:02.581
Why am I the only one
worried about this wedding?

04:06.787 --> 04:09.388
Congratulations.
You failed.

04:09.423 --> 04:12.057
Oh, hey, hey, um,

04:12.092 --> 04:13.592
King needs more wine.

04:13.627 --> 04:15.494
Of course, sire.

04:15.529 --> 04:17.062
I feel bad;
I forgot your name.

04:17.096 --> 04:19.064
It's Smedley, sire.

04:19.099 --> 04:20.932
Smedley.
Thanks, Smedley.

04:20.968 --> 04:23.635
Hey. I'll take that.

04:23.671 --> 04:25.904
Oh, no, wait, I'm--
I'm not done.

04:25.939 --> 04:28.707
I think you were.

04:28.742 --> 04:29.975
Not cool.

04:30.010 --> 04:32.577
Those grapes died
for nothing now.

04:32.613 --> 04:34.980
Those grapes died
so you might live.

04:35.015 --> 04:36.615
Because if you keep drinking,

04:36.650 --> 04:38.917
I will seriously cut a bitch.

04:38.952 --> 04:40.819
You never yell at Eliot
for being drunk.

04:40.854 --> 04:42.521
Because Eliot's fun.

04:42.556 --> 04:45.324
You're depressing.
It's been three months.

04:45.359 --> 04:48.493
Technically, it's only been
a couple of days on Earth, so...

04:48.529 --> 04:50.429
Three months on Fillory

04:50.464 --> 04:52.864
of emo Quentin.

04:52.900 --> 04:54.766
Not my favorite Quentin.

04:54.802 --> 04:57.803
I didn't know that you liked
any of the Quentins.

04:58.839 --> 05:01.606
You had to let Alice go.

05:01.642 --> 05:04.109
I'm...

05:04.144 --> 05:05.677
sympathetic.

05:05.713 --> 05:06.878
Okay?

05:06.914 --> 05:08.580
But meanwhile,

05:08.615 --> 05:11.683
Groomzilla is suddenly
my full-time job.

05:11.719 --> 05:12.984
I need your help.

05:13.020 --> 05:15.721
Bambi!
This is an emergency.

05:15.756 --> 05:17.456
These are all wrong.

05:17.491 --> 05:19.825
You're banished forever.
Thank you.

05:19.860 --> 05:22.894
He's just so mean
when he needs things.

05:22.930 --> 05:25.564
Eliot needs a friend, asshole.

05:25.599 --> 05:27.566
It's your turn to be button boy

05:27.601 --> 05:29.868
and run his random
Earth errands.

05:29.903 --> 05:31.937
I need a free moment

05:31.972 --> 05:34.606
to rub one out in a hot bath

05:34.641 --> 05:37.476
before I fucking kill someone.

05:37.511 --> 05:39.878
That someone being you.

05:41.148 --> 05:42.647
Message received.

05:42.683 --> 05:46.051
And get your feet off my throne.

05:50.457 --> 05:52.057
This is insane.
Why the fuck would Fogg

05:52.092 --> 05:53.092
let Julia go?

05:53.127 --> 05:54.126
Haven't you ever noticed?

05:54.161 --> 05:55.827
Fogg isn't that helpful.

05:55.863 --> 05:57.896
Plus, you knew he couldn't
keep her in there forever.

05:57.931 --> 05:59.998
Yeah, well, I thought
she'd at least be in there

06:00.033 --> 06:02.567
long enough for us to figure out
what to do next.

06:02.603 --> 06:03.935
Where are you going?

06:03.971 --> 06:07.205
I still have Reynard
to deal with.

06:07.241 --> 06:09.441
And I really don't want
to run into Julia.

06:09.476 --> 06:10.675
Fine, let's go.

06:10.711 --> 06:11.977
Okay, no.

06:12.012 --> 06:14.880
Penny, Reynard is my problem.

06:14.915 --> 06:16.181
We've been over this.

06:16.216 --> 06:18.984
Rapist monsters are
a universal problem.

06:19.019 --> 06:20.719
And the last time
you tried to help,

06:20.754 --> 06:24.122
you signed, like, a billion-year
contract with The Order.

06:25.726 --> 06:27.025
When does that start,
by the way?

06:27.060 --> 06:28.794
Not today.

06:28.829 --> 06:31.129
Takes 'em four weeks to process
a book request.

06:31.165 --> 06:32.798
Let's go.

06:41.742 --> 06:43.975
Uh...

06:44.011 --> 06:46.678
where are we?

06:46.713 --> 06:49.014
Penny, we've processed
your application

06:49.049 --> 06:51.583
and would like to formally
welcome you to The Order.

06:53.754 --> 06:55.921
Shit.

06:58.959 --> 07:05.931
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny
www.addic7ed.com</font>

07:05.966 --> 07:08.767
Congratulations!

07:13.640 --> 07:16.875
Kady, we've allowed you here
to assist in Penny's transition.

07:16.910 --> 07:18.710
But I'm afraid I'm not allowed
to discuss the business

07:18.745 --> 07:20.045
of The Order with you present.

07:20.080 --> 07:22.047
Yeah, fine.
I'll fuck off.

07:22.082 --> 07:24.082
Uh, no eating or drinking
in the Library

07:24.117 --> 07:25.317
except where posted.

07:26.854 --> 07:28.887
Now, Penny,

07:28.922 --> 07:32.190
we need to go over some
of your...obligations.

07:34.928 --> 07:36.161
I just don't get it.

07:36.196 --> 07:38.129
I mean, I did head off
a famine--

07:38.165 --> 07:40.232
personally staved off a war.

07:40.267 --> 07:42.067
Not to mention, The Wellspring
is back online.

07:42.102 --> 07:44.703
And yet the people don't like me
any more than they did.

07:44.738 --> 07:47.105
How can you possibly know
what they actually think of you?

07:47.140 --> 07:50.008
There's this Earth magician,
Nate Silver.

07:50.043 --> 07:53.011
I adapted one of his
polling spells.

07:53.046 --> 07:56.314
Right now, my approval rating
is at 26%,

07:56.350 --> 07:58.283
which is not good, Bayler.

07:58.318 --> 07:59.684
Not at all.

07:59.720 --> 08:02.320
But still, why ask me?

08:02.356 --> 08:05.023
Mmm, I don't know.

08:05.058 --> 08:07.325
I figured you might know
why they hate me so much,

08:07.361 --> 08:09.327
seeing as you tried
to murder me.

08:09.363 --> 08:12.030
Okay, that was before
I got to know you.

08:12.065 --> 08:15.967
And before you introduced me
to this Earth delicacy--

08:16.003 --> 08:17.335
na-chos.

08:17.371 --> 08:20.805
Wait till you try
your first margarita.

08:20.841 --> 08:22.941
Mmm.

08:22.976 --> 08:24.843
Listen...

08:24.878 --> 08:27.679
If you're really worried about
what the people think of you,

08:27.714 --> 08:28.914
let's talk about your wedding.

08:28.949 --> 08:31.082
Ugh.
Can we not?

08:31.118 --> 08:32.616
Historically,

08:32.653 --> 08:35.654
a royal wedding is the perfect
time for a monarch

08:35.688 --> 08:37.121
to make their appeal
to the people.

08:37.157 --> 08:39.090
Idri prefers a private ceremony.

08:39.126 --> 08:41.058
But what if you went public?

08:41.094 --> 08:43.193
Might improve your polling.

08:47.167 --> 08:49.100
One for $20, three for $50.

08:49.136 --> 08:52.070
Which gets you the highest?

08:52.105 --> 08:53.939
Highest?

08:53.974 --> 08:56.975
This is grown locally
from heirloom seed stock,

08:57.010 --> 08:59.945
paired with the ideal pastry
for a curated drug experience.

08:59.980 --> 09:01.313
This will make you levitate.

09:01.348 --> 09:03.748
This is like being
hugged by a rainbow.

09:03.784 --> 09:06.051
This is like being
blown by a rainbow.

09:06.086 --> 09:07.285
Do not mix these up.

09:07.321 --> 09:08.720
Yeah, I'll take six.

09:11.358 --> 09:14.793
So the High King needs me?

09:14.828 --> 09:17.896
Yes, he asked
for you specifically.

09:17.931 --> 09:19.664
A command performance.

09:19.700 --> 09:22.267
Righteous.

09:22.302 --> 09:23.835
How are--
how are you doing?

09:23.870 --> 09:26.171
The last time I saw you,
you weren't...

09:26.206 --> 09:28.106
doing so good.

09:28.141 --> 09:29.941
Whatever happened with
the whole, uh--

09:29.977 --> 09:31.142
I let her go.

09:31.178 --> 09:33.044
I'm fine.

09:33.080 --> 09:34.879
I've been self-medicating, so--

09:34.915 --> 09:36.848
uh, they don't have
Abilify in Fillory,

09:36.883 --> 09:39.217
but I have been improvising.

09:39.252 --> 09:43.221
Well, this is Dr. Josh's
prescription.

09:43.256 --> 09:45.857
I mean, we don't have
to race off to Fillory

09:45.892 --> 09:48.226
right this second.

09:48.261 --> 09:49.894
We have a minute.
What's it do?

09:49.930 --> 09:52.931
Dude, lets you see
into other worlds.

09:52.966 --> 09:54.165
It's rad.

10:02.743 --> 10:04.175
This <i> is</i> rad.

10:18.358 --> 10:20.725
Is that you...

10:20.761 --> 10:23.361
Quentin?

10:23.397 --> 10:25.830
Um...

10:25.866 --> 10:28.767
you look familiar.

10:28.802 --> 10:31.903
Holy shit, Julia?

10:31.938 --> 10:33.938
Why do you look
like a 12-year-old?

10:33.974 --> 10:35.907
Because I'm her Shade.

10:38.378 --> 10:41.446
Oh, Q, I'm so happy
to see you again.

10:41.481 --> 10:43.281
I really, really missed you.

10:43.316 --> 10:44.783
Her Shade?

10:44.818 --> 10:46.951
I thought that you were gone.

10:46.987 --> 10:48.286
I'm lost.

10:48.321 --> 10:50.221
I can't find my way home.

10:51.925 --> 10:53.725
This is getting less rad.

10:53.760 --> 10:55.193
Please, Quentin.

10:55.228 --> 10:57.195
I've been looking for a way out,
and then...

10:57.230 --> 10:59.998
suddenly I could see you.

11:00.033 --> 11:02.100
Yeah, you're in another world.

11:02.135 --> 11:03.835
Um...

11:03.870 --> 11:05.036
where are you?

11:05.072 --> 11:07.972
I have no idea.

11:08.008 --> 11:09.274
I can't stay here.

11:09.309 --> 11:10.508
Time is running out.

11:10.544 --> 11:12.477
- Can you help me?
- Yeah, I'll try.

11:12.512 --> 11:13.778
H-how can I find you?

11:13.814 --> 11:15.013
I don't know.

11:15.048 --> 11:16.514
I don't even know
how I got here.

11:16.550 --> 11:18.183
Please, Quentin.

11:18.218 --> 11:20.318
I have to get back to Julia.

11:20.353 --> 11:22.520
You have to find me
before it's too late.

11:42.572 --> 11:44.019
Holy shit, are we at war?

11:44.139 --> 11:45.574
I wish we were at war.

11:45.609 --> 11:47.643
These are the place settings
for the wedding.

11:47.678 --> 11:49.411
Much more dangerous.

11:49.447 --> 11:51.213
How's Josh doing in
the royal kitchens?

11:51.248 --> 11:53.082
Uh...

11:53.117 --> 11:56.318
he's declared them "adequate."

11:56.353 --> 11:58.087
Eliot, I have to go
back to Earth.

11:58.122 --> 11:59.321
Don't be ridiculous.

11:59.356 --> 12:01.290
You have far too much
to do here.

12:01.325 --> 12:02.925
I had a vision, okay?

12:02.960 --> 12:06.662
A way that I can
maybe help Julia.

12:08.099 --> 12:10.299
I can't ignore it.

12:10.334 --> 12:11.667
Can't you?

12:11.702 --> 12:14.603
It was a motherfucking
vision, El.

12:14.638 --> 12:16.205
Look, I don't know
how else to say it.

12:16.240 --> 12:17.639
I just--I feel like this
is something that I--

12:17.675 --> 12:19.374
I have to do right now.

12:22.346 --> 12:23.545
I can see that.

12:25.683 --> 12:28.183
Yeah.

12:28.219 --> 12:32.087
If you miss my wedding,
I will kill you.

12:32.123 --> 12:34.189
- Okay.
- Okay.

12:36.460 --> 12:39.995
Hey, uh, can you help me
find some information?

12:40.030 --> 12:41.230
Of course.

12:41.265 --> 12:42.498
What are you looking for?

12:42.533 --> 12:44.032
Well, say you have a--

12:44.068 --> 12:46.668
a being with an enormous
amount of power.

12:46.704 --> 12:49.738
I'm looking for how
someone might...

12:49.773 --> 12:51.507
you know, defeat them.

12:51.542 --> 12:53.208
How much power?

12:53.244 --> 12:55.644
Let's say...
god-like?

12:55.679 --> 12:57.312
So classical myths?

12:57.348 --> 13:00.983
No, more like a how-to manual.

13:01.018 --> 13:02.351
Let me check upstairs.

13:17.735 --> 13:19.234
So do we just wait?

13:26.243 --> 13:27.442
Oh.

13:34.685 --> 13:36.018
I'm afraid we don't have
any books available

13:36.053 --> 13:37.619
on that particular topic.

13:37.655 --> 13:41.790
There's nothing in the entire
Library of the Neitherlands

13:41.825 --> 13:43.659
on killing any kind of god?

13:43.694 --> 13:45.494
Have you considered that it
might not be strictly possible

13:45.529 --> 13:47.329
to do so?

13:47.364 --> 13:50.165
Didn't the Norse Gods kill
each other, like, all the time?

13:50.201 --> 13:52.067
The Library is full of stories.

13:52.102 --> 13:53.368
It happened.

13:53.404 --> 13:54.570
I know it has.

13:54.605 --> 13:56.705
In Fillory,
The Beast killed Umber.

13:56.740 --> 13:58.607
Sounds fascinating.

13:58.642 --> 14:00.475
Unfortunately, there is no
written record

14:00.511 --> 14:03.679
of the type you seek regarding
the mechanics of such an event.

14:03.714 --> 14:05.214
Terribly sorry.

14:15.359 --> 14:18.627
Struck out looking
for a god-murder spell.

14:18.662 --> 14:21.296
It can't be that no one
in all of history ever--

14:21.332 --> 14:23.532
Well, apparently,
no one ever wrote it down.

14:25.302 --> 14:26.501
Look, if a way exists,

14:26.537 --> 14:27.736
I'm finding it.

14:27.771 --> 14:29.438
So what's up with your hands?

14:29.473 --> 14:31.740
They told me there are
books to help me,

14:31.775 --> 14:35.611
but I'd have to do the research
on my own time.

14:35.646 --> 14:38.347
Seriously? What are you
supposed to do in the meantime?

14:38.382 --> 14:41.183
My job.

14:41.218 --> 14:43.385
Apparently, I track down
overdue books,

14:43.420 --> 14:47.322
and this one has been checked
out for over ten years.

14:47.358 --> 14:48.590
You got to be kidding.

14:48.626 --> 14:51.393
Since I still can't cast,

14:51.428 --> 14:53.829
I thought you could help me out
with a little locator spell?

15:07.177 --> 15:08.243
My King.

15:08.279 --> 15:09.478
Hi, Fen.

15:11.348 --> 15:12.581
Are you all right?

15:12.616 --> 15:16.151
Yes, fine.
How go the wedding preparations?

15:16.186 --> 15:19.321
Oh... they're fine.

15:19.356 --> 15:20.889
Is there anything
I can help with?

15:23.294 --> 15:27.763
Is that something that you'd
actually want to help with?

15:27.798 --> 15:30.265
You're acting like you think
I'd disapprove of it.

15:30.301 --> 15:33.802
Your husband is about to
welcome another husband

15:33.837 --> 15:35.604
into his bed.

15:35.639 --> 15:37.339
You're a king.

15:37.374 --> 15:39.174
Of course you will.

15:39.209 --> 15:42.644
I gather a three-person marriage
isn't normal on Earth?

15:42.680 --> 15:45.881
Not outside of Utah.

15:45.916 --> 15:47.349
Or some websites.

15:47.384 --> 15:51.286
Those are cities
made of pixels, right?

15:51.322 --> 15:52.621
Close.

15:52.656 --> 15:55.724
My mission,
so you understand it,

15:55.759 --> 15:58.226
is to protect our
growing family.

15:58.262 --> 16:00.629
Your marriage to Idri means
a stronger kingdom

16:00.664 --> 16:02.397
to raise our child in.

16:02.433 --> 16:04.566
You are being way more
understanding about this

16:04.601 --> 16:06.601
than I would be in your shoes.

16:06.637 --> 16:08.203
That's my job.

16:10.741 --> 16:14.176
Look, I'm gonna go talk
to my royal chef.

16:14.211 --> 16:15.711
Care to join?

16:15.746 --> 16:16.812
Thanks.

16:16.847 --> 16:19.414
I'm... not feeling good.

16:19.450 --> 16:21.450
It's morning sickness.

16:58.355 --> 17:00.322
Q, leave.

17:00.357 --> 17:01.357
I'm not going anywhere.

17:01.392 --> 17:02.624
Just open the door.

17:04.595 --> 17:06.494
Fuck, I could've--

17:06.530 --> 17:07.729
I could've killed you.

17:10.701 --> 17:13.702
You know, I never--
I never once stopped to ask

17:13.737 --> 17:15.537
if I was doing the right thing.

17:18.474 --> 17:20.509
And now it's all I ask.

17:23.012 --> 17:25.513
If I did this,

17:25.549 --> 17:27.549
would Q look at me
like I'm evil?

17:32.423 --> 17:34.356
I can't...

17:34.391 --> 17:37.025
really feel any of it anymore.

17:38.862 --> 17:40.829
I'm doing it from memory.

17:45.302 --> 17:47.269
I'm broken.

17:47.304 --> 17:49.604
And that makes me dangerous.

17:49.640 --> 17:52.507
So you should go.

17:52.543 --> 17:55.043
Jules...

17:55.078 --> 17:57.379
I talked to your Shade.

18:01.485 --> 18:04.653
Wait, so you saw her in a--

18:04.688 --> 18:07.823
Yeah, uh, I mean,
there were drugs involved.

18:07.858 --> 18:09.724
But I--I know that it was real.

18:10.994 --> 18:12.427
And she's still alive?

18:12.463 --> 18:14.029
Yeah.

18:14.064 --> 18:15.764
Well, I don't really know
if that term applies here,

18:15.799 --> 18:17.332
but she's not gone.

18:19.870 --> 18:22.370
So where is she?

18:22.406 --> 18:24.639
I don't know.

18:24.675 --> 18:26.541
But wherever she is,

18:26.577 --> 18:28.343
she wants us to find her.

18:31.915 --> 18:34.516
- What is this?
- Culinary classic.

18:34.551 --> 18:37.919
Oysters and pearls
from the French Laundry.

18:37.955 --> 18:39.955
I had to get Thomas Keller
so wrecked

18:39.990 --> 18:41.957
before he'd show me
the secret to that recipe.

18:47.397 --> 18:50.432
Mmm.

18:50.467 --> 18:53.468
I just don't think
it's "Fillory" enough.

18:53.504 --> 18:56.638
But half of Fillory
eats boiled mutton.

18:56.673 --> 18:58.507
Let's introduce them to,
like, actual food.

18:58.542 --> 18:59.941
This is their world.

18:59.977 --> 19:01.843
We have to meet them halfway,
don't you think?

19:01.879 --> 19:03.512
Well, if half your recipe
is shit,

19:03.547 --> 19:04.980
it's all going to taste
like shit.

19:05.015 --> 19:06.948
Okay, okay.
Fine, fine.

19:06.984 --> 19:08.717
Forget the dish.

19:08.752 --> 19:11.920
Let's start with, "What do you
want people to feel

19:11.955 --> 19:13.822
when they eat it?"

19:13.857 --> 19:16.525
I want everyone to like me.

19:16.560 --> 19:18.426
Then let's just make this easy.

19:18.462 --> 19:20.695
I'll make a potion.
Poof!

19:20.731 --> 19:22.130
They'll like you!

19:22.165 --> 19:24.566
- Donesies!
- I need this.

19:29.907 --> 19:31.373
There's nothing in here either.

19:31.408 --> 19:32.707
Got to keep looking.

19:32.743 --> 19:35.577
So scratchy.

19:35.612 --> 19:37.612
Go away, Todd.

19:37.648 --> 19:40.015
Stuff about the afterlife
is super wonky.

19:40.050 --> 19:42.517
It's too close to religion.

19:42.553 --> 19:45.554
It's--it's hard to figure out
what's not a flat-out lie.

19:45.589 --> 19:46.621
Right?

19:46.657 --> 19:49.491
Hey, is this place real?

19:51.662 --> 19:52.961
No.

19:55.532 --> 19:56.998
You're hungover, Todd.

19:58.435 --> 20:00.402
Look, I found a passage here.

20:00.437 --> 20:03.104
Sort of vague,
but it mentions Shades.

20:03.140 --> 20:04.873
One passage in a dozen books?

20:04.908 --> 20:08.009
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, Shades.

20:08.045 --> 20:09.177
I mean, something.

20:09.212 --> 20:10.712
Nobody talks about Shades.

20:10.747 --> 20:11.746
There's got to be a reason.

20:11.782 --> 20:13.415
I know, right?

20:13.450 --> 20:17.485
I mean, when Fogg talked
about 'em the other day,

20:17.521 --> 20:20.055
it was the first
I heard about 'em.

20:22.125 --> 20:23.825
What?

20:23.860 --> 20:27.796
My work study job--
I type up Fogg's memoirs.

20:27.831 --> 20:30.732
I guess he has, like,
a crazy book deal.

20:30.767 --> 20:32.734
He's led a seriously weird life.

20:32.769 --> 20:35.971
Did you know that
he and Bob Ross

20:36.006 --> 20:39.074
had a dark artistic rivalry,
and--

20:39.109 --> 20:40.642
What did he say about Shades?

20:42.045 --> 20:44.813
Something like he knew someone

20:44.848 --> 20:47.182
who was obsessed with them?

20:47.217 --> 20:50.151
I do know--
or I suppose I knew

20:50.187 --> 20:52.621
someone who was
interested in Shades--

20:52.656 --> 20:53.955
was.

20:53.991 --> 20:56.524
Ah, it's rather confusing.

20:56.560 --> 20:57.464
Confusing why?

20:57.584 --> 20:59.628
Because you know her too.

20:59.663 --> 21:00.996
It's Alice.

21:06.301 --> 21:08.769
Honestly, I don't think that
she knew anything about Shades.

21:08.805 --> 21:09.805
No, of course not.

21:10.101 --> 21:11.601
That Alice didn't.

21:11.636 --> 21:13.269
This Alice is a different story.

21:13.304 --> 21:14.771
What do you mean "this" Alice?

21:14.806 --> 21:17.340
Do you recall the time loop
I told you about?

21:17.375 --> 21:19.208
The 39 lifetimes?

21:19.244 --> 21:21.077
No one remembers them except me.

21:21.112 --> 21:22.712
Yeah, of course.
You knew another me.

21:22.747 --> 21:24.580
The Alice from the 23rd timeline

21:24.616 --> 21:27.150
was the sole survivor
of The Beast.

21:27.185 --> 21:30.253
She became obsessed
with the afterlife,

21:30.288 --> 21:33.389
how to commune with lost souls,

21:33.424 --> 21:35.091
and Shades.

21:35.126 --> 21:38.661
Would she know
where one would go?

21:38.696 --> 21:40.096
I don't know what she knew.

21:40.131 --> 21:41.631
She just talked
about them a lot.

21:41.666 --> 21:44.333
She was different
than your Alice.

21:44.369 --> 21:47.336
She was hurt--broken.

21:47.372 --> 21:48.738
We need to talk to her.

21:48.773 --> 21:51.174
Well, you can't.
It's already happened.

21:51.209 --> 21:54.777
Essentially in another universe.

21:54.813 --> 21:58.281
It's gone.

21:58.316 --> 22:00.316
Well, what about
a Tesla Flexion?

22:03.188 --> 22:05.421
What is it?

22:05.456 --> 22:07.557
It's how we could talk to her.

22:13.731 --> 22:15.331
Can I ask you a woman question?

22:15.366 --> 22:18.234
Ugh. I barely
understand women.

22:18.269 --> 22:19.735
I think my pregnant wife

22:19.771 --> 22:23.105
might be having weird
pregnant wife feelings.

22:23.141 --> 22:24.340
Ew.

22:24.375 --> 22:25.875
Definitely not my rice bowl.

22:25.910 --> 22:30.346
She just seems like
her head is elsewhere

22:30.381 --> 22:31.647
all the time.

22:31.683 --> 22:32.648
What do you mean?

22:32.684 --> 22:34.250
Every time I run into her,

22:34.285 --> 22:36.352
I feel like I'm interrupting
a conversation.

22:36.387 --> 22:38.287
Except there's
no one else there.

22:47.298 --> 22:49.832
What is it?

22:49.868 --> 22:52.335
Nothing.

22:52.370 --> 22:54.237
I need some air.

23:02.747 --> 23:04.647
Fuzzbeat?

23:04.682 --> 23:06.249
It's, like, a website.

23:06.284 --> 23:08.517
They do serious news
and cat videos at the same time.

23:08.553 --> 23:10.186
That's fucking dumb.

23:10.221 --> 23:12.141
Well, it's where the tracking
spell said to go.

23:14.592 --> 23:16.359
We're looking for Harriet.

23:16.394 --> 23:17.894
And you are?

23:17.929 --> 23:19.762
Just tell we're from The Order.

23:19.797 --> 23:22.531
Is that the new Pilates place?

23:22.567 --> 23:24.200
- Yes.
- Sweet.

23:30.742 --> 23:32.842
That's a fucking unicorn
in a tutu.

23:41.386 --> 23:43.252
We're here for the book.

23:43.288 --> 23:45.655
"Principles of Conjuring
Elementals."

23:45.690 --> 23:47.790
It's ten years overdue.

23:48.826 --> 23:50.393
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

23:50.428 --> 23:53.262
She's not casting.

23:53.298 --> 23:54.764
She's signing.

23:54.799 --> 23:56.766
Oh.

23:56.801 --> 23:58.467
Yeah, I--I don't--
I don't speak that.

23:58.503 --> 24:00.670
She said we don't
look like librarians.

24:00.705 --> 24:03.239
All right, well, you know,

24:03.274 --> 24:04.774
tell her we're looking
for the book.

24:06.811 --> 24:09.445
We need that book back.

24:09.480 --> 24:10.646
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

24:10.682 --> 24:12.782
Your signing is terrible.

24:12.817 --> 24:16.619
Yeah, my signing's
a little rusty.

24:32.537 --> 24:35.438
- What'd she say?
- Uh, don't worry about it.

24:37.542 --> 24:39.342
So what's your deal?

24:39.377 --> 24:43.779
You write listicles, and you do
magic in your spare time?

24:43.815 --> 24:44.847
No.

24:44.882 --> 24:46.816
This is my magic.

24:46.851 --> 24:48.517
What are you talking about?

24:48.553 --> 24:49.919
Your clickbait site?

24:55.460 --> 24:56.726
Yeah, right.

24:56.761 --> 24:59.528
- What the fuck is she saying?
- Shh.

24:59.564 --> 25:00.930
See for yourself.

25:03.067 --> 25:06.535
"18 Pandas With Things
That Look Like Pandas"?

25:06.571 --> 25:08.337
Half of those don't
even look like pandas.

25:12.610 --> 25:16.512
That's how to conjure
dark matter!

25:16.547 --> 25:18.047
What did you do to the pandas?

25:18.082 --> 25:20.049
It's an encoded spell.

25:20.084 --> 25:21.484
All these articles are.

25:23.755 --> 25:25.454
Wait, wait, how about--

25:25.490 --> 25:27.490
how about "Drunk Guys
Eating Kids' Vitamins"?

25:32.663 --> 25:34.663
No! Really?

25:34.699 --> 25:36.399
- Oh, my God, that's--
- Yeah, when you guys

25:36.434 --> 25:38.434
are done bonding, do you think
you could ask her

25:38.469 --> 25:39.869
for the book now, please?

25:39.904 --> 25:42.371
Relax, kid.

25:42.407 --> 25:44.573
I'll find it.

25:44.609 --> 25:45.609
Oh.

25:47.345 --> 25:48.644
Mm!

25:48.679 --> 25:49.745
Just give us a sec.

25:53.785 --> 25:57.086
So I don't get it.
Why do all this?

26:06.030 --> 26:07.863
You're not wrong.

26:10.134 --> 26:13.369
Well, I was looking
for the kind of knowledge

26:13.404 --> 26:14.937
the Library doesn't have.

26:16.541 --> 26:18.541
Oh, the usual--
beauty tips, recipes,

26:18.576 --> 26:20.009
how to kill a trickster god.

26:28.386 --> 26:29.552
Ah.

26:43.367 --> 26:46.001
- Here you go.
- Finally.

26:46.037 --> 26:47.436
Let's go.

26:47.472 --> 26:49.438
- Have a nice day.
- Fuck off.

27:00.518 --> 27:01.951
Thank you.

27:12.218 --> 27:14.465
Why am I staring at a plate
of half-eaten nachos?

27:14.581 --> 27:17.119
A question I've asked myself
very often at 3:00 a.m.

27:17.239 --> 27:20.274
- So I was doing the dishes--
- You're supposed to be cooking.

27:20.394 --> 27:21.735
I know. I...

27:21.770 --> 27:24.471
kind of roofied the dishwasher.

27:24.506 --> 27:27.708
Um, that is not okay.

27:27.743 --> 27:30.477
No, not "roofied" roofied.

27:30.512 --> 27:32.646
Uh, more like he loves
everyone so much,

27:32.681 --> 27:33.847
he's catatonic.

27:33.882 --> 27:35.115
It was an accident.

27:35.150 --> 27:38.085
I was testing
the potion for you.

27:38.120 --> 27:40.387
Might have made it
a little too strong.

27:40.422 --> 27:41.922
Forget it.
Doesn't matter.

27:41.957 --> 27:44.725
The point is, I found this.

27:49.865 --> 27:53.033
"Wedding day.
Western gate unguarded.

27:53.068 --> 27:55.502
Bring gifts there."

27:55.537 --> 27:58.405
I'm assuming they're not talking
about actual gifts.

27:58.440 --> 27:59.873
No.

27:59.908 --> 28:01.742
They're talking about
chopping our heads off.

28:01.777 --> 28:02.909
Ooh.

28:02.945 --> 28:05.679
That backgammon-playing prick.

28:05.714 --> 28:07.914
Ah! I was so stupid.

28:07.950 --> 28:09.983
After all the hours I spent
down in the dungeon,

28:10.019 --> 28:11.952
I actually thought
I'd won Bayler over.

28:11.987 --> 28:13.854
I thought I had
rehabbed his soul.

28:13.889 --> 28:15.722
Oh, honey.

28:15.758 --> 28:19.559
We both know rehab is about more
than nachos and backgammon.

28:19.595 --> 28:20.794
Is it?

28:20.829 --> 28:22.696
Is it, Margo?

28:22.731 --> 28:25.932
Wait, so you're upset because
the guy who tried to kill you

28:25.968 --> 28:28.435
is gonna try and kill you again?

28:28.470 --> 28:29.670
I should've executed him.

28:29.705 --> 28:30.671
It's not like anybody
likes me anyway.

28:30.706 --> 28:32.105
I'm down 5%.

28:32.141 --> 28:34.741
And now the Fu Fighters
are gonna red my wedding!

28:34.777 --> 28:35.976
No.

28:36.011 --> 28:38.011
Okay? We won't let that happen.

28:39.181 --> 28:40.914
Josh, where's that dishwasher?

28:40.949 --> 28:41.915
Still in the armoire.

28:41.950 --> 28:43.817
Why is he in the armoire?

28:43.852 --> 28:45.952
'Cause I'm not good
in a crisis, okay?

28:45.988 --> 28:48.955
How were you ever a drug dealer?

28:50.659 --> 28:53.894
Look, that note was meant
for the dishwasher.

28:53.929 --> 28:56.463
He's probably been passing
messages to the Fu Fighters

28:56.498 --> 28:58.398
this whole time,
so here's what we do.

28:58.434 --> 29:00.000
We help him sober up,
and then--

29:00.035 --> 29:01.768
We execute him.

29:01.804 --> 29:03.203
No.

29:03.238 --> 29:06.006
But it means so much to me
that you want to.

29:07.710 --> 29:09.876
We put the note back
into the dirty dishes.

29:09.912 --> 29:13.480
We let him find it and take it
back to the Fu Fighters' base.

29:13.515 --> 29:14.681
Josh?

29:14.717 --> 29:16.483
How much of that potion
can you make?

29:16.518 --> 29:18.618
I--I don't know.
A buttload?

29:18.654 --> 29:19.853
That'll do.

29:23.158 --> 29:25.125
Bambi, what are you casting?

29:25.160 --> 29:27.160
Tracking spell.

29:27.196 --> 29:28.862
Then we'll know exactly
where to find

29:28.897 --> 29:31.098
those Dave Grohl-wannabe
bitches.

29:35.971 --> 29:37.137
Gotcha.

29:37.172 --> 29:39.172
The Fu Fighters' encampment.

29:39.208 --> 29:41.241
Okay, guys, here you go.

29:41.276 --> 29:44.911
Aw, it's a shame, isn't it, El?

29:44.947 --> 29:47.481
Utter shame.

29:47.516 --> 29:48.715
I mean, I can't be the one

29:48.751 --> 29:50.951
to sneak into
the Fu Fighters' base.

29:50.986 --> 29:52.519
Certainly not.
You don't sneak.

29:52.554 --> 29:53.887
Mm-mm.

29:53.922 --> 29:55.822
And you can't be the one
to dump that potion

29:55.858 --> 29:59.526
into whatever disgusting stew
they're cooking for dinner.

29:59.561 --> 30:00.794
Sadly, no.

30:00.829 --> 30:03.063
My eminence is too easy
to spot from afar.

30:03.098 --> 30:04.698
Hmm.

30:04.733 --> 30:07.701
If only we had someone
they'd never seen--

30:07.736 --> 30:11.271
Guys, stop the bit.
I'll go.

30:11.306 --> 30:16.243
Eternal glory awaits you,
O Joshua of Yonkers.

30:16.278 --> 30:19.946
Eternal glory.

30:19.982 --> 30:21.181
You done?

30:21.216 --> 30:23.016
I'm done.

30:23.051 --> 30:24.251
Great.

30:30.058 --> 30:32.159
Here's your overdue book.

30:32.194 --> 30:35.162
Now can you find me some shit
to help with my hands, please?

30:35.197 --> 30:37.798
I will look for some <i> thing</i>

30:37.833 --> 30:39.800
to help you with that
in just a moment.

30:56.218 --> 30:58.051
Are you okay?

31:05.160 --> 31:06.726
Uh, hello?

31:11.733 --> 31:13.266
Uh, I asked you a question, man.

31:13.302 --> 31:15.035
- Are you okay?
- No!

31:16.672 --> 31:18.605
I can't control my...

31:18.640 --> 31:19.840
look out!

31:25.614 --> 31:27.147
No!

31:29.251 --> 31:32.448
I can't... stop!

31:52.214 --> 31:54.916
The card was cursed.
A Modus Hex.

31:54.951 --> 31:56.984
It forces you to perform
an action against your will.

31:57.020 --> 31:58.586
Yeah, but that dude
killed himself.

31:58.621 --> 32:00.154
Okay? The hex didn't
make him do that.

32:00.190 --> 32:01.723
His name was Howard.

32:01.758 --> 32:03.925
And if it wasn't
for his bravery,

32:03.960 --> 32:05.526
the hex would have forced him
to do something

32:05.562 --> 32:07.028
incredibly dangerous.

32:07.063 --> 32:08.629
Open a door?

32:08.665 --> 32:10.098
It isn't just any door.

32:10.133 --> 32:12.066
Then what is it?

32:12.102 --> 32:14.035
As a novice of The Order,
there are many secrets

32:14.070 --> 32:15.770
that will be imparted to you
when the time is right.

32:15.805 --> 32:16.971
I just watched a man
kill himself!

32:17.006 --> 32:18.206
What's behind the door?

32:20.910 --> 32:22.710
The Poison Room.

32:22.746 --> 32:24.545
The what?

32:24.581 --> 32:26.647
It's where we store books
too dangerous for the public.

32:26.683 --> 32:29.550
I suspect Harriet's curse was an
attempt to steal its contents.

32:29.586 --> 32:31.185
Wait, Howard kamikazed himself

32:31.221 --> 32:33.554
'cause someone wanted
some banned books?

32:33.590 --> 32:35.757
That's pretty fucked up!

32:35.792 --> 32:37.425
What is...

32:37.460 --> 32:40.128
fucked up is that there
is knowledge out there

32:40.163 --> 32:41.696
so dangerous we need
a Poison Room

32:41.731 --> 32:43.164
so it doesn't fall
into the wrong hands.

32:43.199 --> 32:46.701
That is why Howard
sacrificed his life.

32:46.736 --> 32:48.636
It's something all
Librarians would do.

32:48.671 --> 32:50.571
So he had to die to keep
someone from getting

32:50.607 --> 32:52.573
their hands on what?

32:52.609 --> 32:54.475
Some crazy battle magic?

32:54.511 --> 32:56.210
There is knowledge
behind that door, Penny,

32:56.246 --> 32:59.614
that could destroy more
than just people.

32:59.649 --> 33:02.917
It could destroy worlds.

33:02.952 --> 33:05.553
The Tesla Flexion has only
been successfully employed

33:05.588 --> 33:06.988
once before.

33:07.023 --> 33:09.791
Luckily, we're using
the original equipment,

33:09.826 --> 33:12.093
left to Brakebills by
the man who invented it.

33:12.128 --> 33:13.528
Nikola Tesla?

33:13.563 --> 33:15.630
No, Fred Flexion.

33:17.100 --> 33:19.233
Okay.

33:19.269 --> 33:21.803
And it's only been used
once before because--

33:21.838 --> 33:24.739
Three people died trying
to shut it down last time.

33:24.774 --> 33:26.507
What's the tent for?

33:26.543 --> 33:29.710
The Flexion is a fold between
two different realities.

33:29.746 --> 33:32.046
The tented area is where
they cross over.

33:32.081 --> 33:34.215
Now, Ms. Wicker and I
will work together

33:34.250 --> 33:35.650
to cast the Flexion,

33:35.685 --> 33:37.819
but if we hold it longer
than two minutes,

33:37.854 --> 33:40.121
we will all die.

33:40.156 --> 33:42.156
Well, don't sugarcoat it.

33:42.192 --> 33:43.858
Quentin...

33:46.529 --> 33:47.995
Get the answers that you need,

33:48.031 --> 33:50.164
and then get out.

33:50.200 --> 33:52.533
Understood?

33:52.569 --> 33:56.037
And try not to touch
anything in there.

33:56.072 --> 33:58.239
Okay. Why?

33:58.274 --> 33:59.640
Matter from different realities

33:59.676 --> 34:01.075
occupying the same space

34:01.110 --> 34:02.276
can create a paradox.

34:02.312 --> 34:05.079
More like an explosion.

34:05.114 --> 34:07.281
As well a mess of problems
for the people who'd find

34:07.317 --> 34:10.016
what's left of our bodies.

34:10.053 --> 34:11.652
Touch nothing.

34:11.688 --> 34:13.154
Got it.

34:15.091 --> 34:17.158
Dude, their shit was
seriously jacked up.

34:17.193 --> 34:19.694
Their K-holes were
inside K-holes.

34:19.728 --> 34:21.629
Does that even make sense?

34:21.664 --> 34:23.164
I'm just saying, the Fu Fighters

34:23.199 --> 34:26.199
are out of "comish"
for the foreseeable future.

34:26.235 --> 34:28.101
Your wedding may
proceed apace, sire.

34:28.137 --> 34:32.739
And you, good sir, may shave
any nymph in the kingdom.

34:32.775 --> 34:35.842
- Like right now?
- Like right now.

34:35.879 --> 34:38.846
You are my once and future king.

34:43.186 --> 34:44.985
Just floating this:

34:45.021 --> 34:48.188
would it be weird
if I fucked Josh?

34:48.224 --> 34:50.791
I certainly hope
it would be weird.

34:53.228 --> 34:55.929
To my quick-thinking Bambi,

34:55.965 --> 34:57.932
who saved the day again.

35:00.937 --> 35:02.303
Speaking of saving the day,

35:02.338 --> 35:05.740
did you ever manage
to talk to Fen?

35:05.775 --> 35:08.609
Um, yeah.

35:08.645 --> 35:09.810
She's fine.

35:09.846 --> 35:10.945
Good.

35:10.980 --> 35:12.179
That's a relief.

35:14.083 --> 35:17.351
Fen? Fen!

35:24.227 --> 35:26.928
I want to talk to you about
the terms of our deal.

35:34.103 --> 35:36.037
Oh, shit.

35:36.072 --> 35:38.105
- Shit, shit--
- You saw it?

35:38.141 --> 35:40.141
You saw it too.

35:40.176 --> 35:41.142
Fen!

35:41.177 --> 35:43.110
I'm not going mad.

35:43.146 --> 35:46.380
Well...

35:46.416 --> 35:48.649
no.

35:48.685 --> 35:50.318
You're not.

35:50.353 --> 35:53.154
It was a fairy, okay?

35:53.189 --> 35:55.256
Look, the day
The Wellspring failed,

35:55.291 --> 35:57.391
I made a deal to save
Eliot's life.

35:57.427 --> 35:58.893
You did, too.

35:58.928 --> 36:00.728
I don't understand.

36:00.763 --> 36:02.964
You agreed to do whatever
it took to save him.

36:02.999 --> 36:04.131
But I didn't.

36:04.167 --> 36:06.734
Well, you did.

36:06.769 --> 36:08.002
What do they want?

36:09.839 --> 36:11.405
Your baby.

36:11.441 --> 36:13.307
- What?
- Fen...

36:13.343 --> 36:15.176
I can stop this.

36:15.211 --> 36:17.311
You better fix this, because I
will not let them

36:17.347 --> 36:18.913
take my child.

36:22.986 --> 36:25.653
Fuck.

37:11.100 --> 37:13.868
Quentin?

37:13.903 --> 37:14.935
Is that you?

37:14.971 --> 37:16.203
You're in a Tesla Flexion.

37:16.239 --> 37:18.272
I'm from another timeline.

37:18.307 --> 37:19.840
We only have two minutes.

37:19.876 --> 37:21.876
I need you to tell me
everything you know

37:21.911 --> 37:23.344
about Shades.

37:23.379 --> 37:25.112
It is you.

37:25.148 --> 37:26.881
Another you--you're alive.

37:26.916 --> 37:29.884
No, stop.
We can't touch.

37:29.919 --> 37:31.252
I'm sorry.
We have to go fast.

37:31.287 --> 37:33.087
I understand.

37:33.122 --> 37:34.989
Um...

37:35.024 --> 37:36.123
I'll tell you everything I know.

37:36.159 --> 37:38.025
It's just...

37:38.061 --> 37:39.927
I thought I'd never
see you again.

37:39.962 --> 37:42.930
The Beast, he--
he tore you apart

37:42.965 --> 37:44.965
piece by piece,
but not just your body,

37:45.001 --> 37:46.901
but your--your Shade,
everything.

37:46.936 --> 37:48.502
My Shade.
Do you know where it went?

37:48.538 --> 37:51.472
I searched everywhere for it.

37:51.507 --> 37:53.774
You can't rest in peace
without it.

37:53.810 --> 37:56.811
But there are no books
on how to do...

37:56.846 --> 37:59.146
so I traveled the world in
search of anyone, anything,

37:59.182 --> 38:00.347
that could help me.

38:00.383 --> 38:02.850
What did you learn?

38:02.885 --> 38:05.920
Shades go to The Underworld.

38:05.955 --> 38:07.121
There's an Underworld?

38:07.156 --> 38:08.989
It's only accessible
to the dead.

38:09.025 --> 38:10.925
But there's a catch.

38:10.960 --> 38:13.160
Alice, what happened
to your hand?

38:13.196 --> 38:14.995
Doesn't matter.

38:15.031 --> 38:18.332
It's the least I gave up
to learn this.

38:21.904 --> 38:23.838
The living can access
The Underworld

38:23.873 --> 38:25.073
with the help of a Gatekeeper.

38:25.108 --> 38:27.041
- A Gatekeeper?
- An ancient one.

38:27.076 --> 38:29.310
A being older than
the world itself.

38:29.345 --> 38:32.146
Okay, how do you find
one of those?

38:32.181 --> 38:34.315
I don't know.

38:34.350 --> 38:37.451
I'm still looking.

38:42.291 --> 38:44.225
- I have to go.
- Please, please--

38:44.260 --> 38:45.559
just one more thing.

38:47.230 --> 38:48.496
We can't hold it
much longer, Quentin!

38:48.531 --> 38:51.432
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

38:51.467 --> 38:53.467
Sorry for what?

38:55.204 --> 38:57.938
When you died,

38:57.974 --> 38:59.874
we weren't in a good place.

39:01.477 --> 39:04.245
We were--we were fighting,

39:04.280 --> 39:08.415
and I was too proud to--
to let it go.

39:12.088 --> 39:13.854
I don't know what that
other Quentin felt,

39:13.890 --> 39:17.057
but in this world, I love you.

39:17.093 --> 39:18.826
Okay.

39:18.861 --> 39:21.362
No matter what.

39:21.397 --> 39:23.130
I love you.

39:46.544 --> 39:49.202
Yeah, but Harriet didn't know
the guy was gonna kill himself.

39:49.322 --> 39:50.547
Are you defending her?

39:50.583 --> 39:54.090
No, I'm just saying that
she's not totally wrong.

39:55.194 --> 39:56.794
The Librarians are
hiding something.

39:56.829 --> 39:58.762
Yeah, things that are
insanely dangerous.

39:58.798 --> 40:00.364
They could have good reasons.

40:00.399 --> 40:01.565
Okay, and who the fuck
are librarians to decide

40:01.601 --> 40:03.300
who gets what?

40:03.336 --> 40:05.169
Do you really want every
Hedge Witch with a grudge

40:05.204 --> 40:07.671
and a bad idea to get
a nuclear bomb?

40:07.707 --> 40:09.707
Fuck you.

40:09.742 --> 40:11.675
I'm not talking about you.

40:11.711 --> 40:14.712
Yeah, you are.

40:14.747 --> 40:18.148
No, I'm not.

40:18.184 --> 40:19.550
Think we might be too late.

40:19.585 --> 40:22.186
Motherfucker.

40:24.957 --> 40:26.657
No.

40:26.692 --> 40:28.325
No, no...

40:45.411 --> 40:48.579
"The Ars Deicidium"?

40:48.614 --> 40:50.214
"The Art of Killing Gods."

40:53.719 --> 40:56.420
Eliot?
Oh, thank God.

40:56.455 --> 40:58.255
I don't know what to do.

40:58.290 --> 40:59.957
Margo made a deal with
the fairies and they're

40:59.992 --> 41:02.292
coming for our baby.

41:04.964 --> 41:06.930
A deal is a deal.

41:14.340 --> 41:16.607
You've been staring
at that page for an hour.

41:17.977 --> 41:19.610
Oh.

41:22.314 --> 41:24.348
I just keep seeing her face.

41:29.955 --> 41:31.755
I get that you're hurting.

41:34.894 --> 41:37.261
I don't know what to say
to make you feel better.

41:37.296 --> 41:39.563
It's okay.

41:39.598 --> 41:41.899
I don't really want
to feel better anyway.

41:54.780 --> 41:58.949
Maybe I better not
show you this then.

41:58.984 --> 42:01.452
I think I figured out
what an Ancient One is.

42:08.494 --> 42:10.694
No fucking way.
