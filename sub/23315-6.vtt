WEBVTT

00:01.233 --> 00:01.433
.

00:08.000 --> 00:10.267
Oi-oi! We're back!

00:13.833 --> 00:15.733
Get me back in that house.

00:16.833 --> 00:18.867
Stand by. Geordies incoming.

00:21.367 --> 00:23.133
Oh, my God.

00:25.767 --> 00:29.700
I'm so excited, I
ka-ka-poo-pooed
in my knickers.

00:36.267 --> 00:39.833
What's the three things
that Geordies are good at?

00:39.900 --> 00:41.000
Buckin'...

00:41.067 --> 00:42.767
...neckin'...

00:42.833 --> 00:44.233
...and drinkin'.

00:46.467 --> 00:48.667
Toon, we are coming for ya.

00:52.267 --> 00:54.367
Shit's about to go down.

00:55.433 --> 00:56.467
This is mint.

00:59.733 --> 01:01.733
I wanna take you out
on a, like, date.

01:01.800 --> 01:03.467
(yells)
I don't like water.

01:03.533 --> 01:04.900
What am I doing here?

01:04.967 --> 01:07.500
Them two getting together.
Not good enough.

01:07.567 --> 01:10.767
I have had enough
of watching Chloe and Sam neck
on.

01:12.967 --> 01:14.533
We are fucking back.

01:14.600 --> 01:17.500
I was really hoping that
Aaron and Marnie would be here.

01:20.833 --> 01:23.233
Steph has got a lot of fighting
talk

01:23.300 --> 01:25.833
but she hasn't seen my Marns
kick off.

01:28.867 --> 01:31.800
Not a holiday romance.
More. Didn't think it would be.

01:31.867 --> 01:33.800
Has he caught fucking feelings?

01:33.867 --> 01:34.933
No!

01:35.000 --> 01:36.233
Food fight!

01:36.300 --> 01:39.967
I surrender!
Why's Abbie cockblocking us?

01:40.033 --> 01:44.100
That curling tong is very
special
so what's it doing up Nathan's
arse?!

01:45.967 --> 01:48.733
I'm a natural beauty.
Real boobs, real hair.

01:48.800 --> 01:51.767
I'm a lad who's got more cheek
than a girl with fillers.

01:51.833 --> 01:54.567
I'm tanned, toned
and ready to tash on.

01:54.633 --> 01:56.567
I'm preened to perfection.

01:56.633 --> 01:58.800
I'm totally crackers, me, like.

01:58.867 --> 02:01.500
I'm cheeky, colourful
and full of mischief.

02:01.567 --> 02:04.300
I can talk the back legs
off a donkey.

02:04.367 --> 02:08.233
I might be entirely bonkers
but all the best people are.

02:08.300 --> 02:10.699
(all) Geordie Shore, way-aye!

02:24.400 --> 02:27.467
Morning, everyone!
Shut your energy up right now.

02:27.533 --> 02:29.667
Isn't this lovely?
Altogether.

02:29.733 --> 02:33.700
These are the mornings I love,
when all the family is in one
room.

02:33.767 --> 02:35.600
Always have the best time ever.

02:35.667 --> 02:38.233
For first night back in
Newcastle
it was mint.

02:38.300 --> 02:40.000
So good.
It was so good.

02:40.067 --> 02:42.733
I thought when we get back
it won't be the same.

02:42.800 --> 02:45.700
It was better.
Fucking back!

02:45.767 --> 02:49.267
Last night was amazing. I wish
that Aaron and Marnie were here

02:49.333 --> 02:51.033
to get involved with the craic.

02:51.100 --> 02:54.367
And when I say craic,
I mean Nathan's crack.

02:54.433 --> 02:57.433
Nathan, how's your bum?
Don't wanna speak about that.

02:57.500 --> 02:58.800
I want to.
No.

02:58.867 --> 03:02.467
I've woke up this morning
feeling
like I've been abducted by
aliens

03:02.533 --> 03:04.100
and anal probed.
(gasps)

03:04.167 --> 03:07.433
That's a lie! That's a lie
cos my arsehole does not stink.

03:07.500 --> 03:10.500
Full on poo.
Chloe, got your Prince Charming.

03:10.567 --> 03:13.100
Tell me what was happening
in the showers?

03:13.167 --> 03:16.633
What wasn't happening?
Go on, tell us then!

03:16.700 --> 03:18.700
Chloe had a little taster last
night

03:18.767 --> 03:22.267
so I feel like she's woke up
wanting more. I am buzzing.

03:22.333 --> 03:24.933
When you do have sex,
I will be watching.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.333
Sat there like this.

03:26.400 --> 03:28.633
Why, though?
Why would you wanna watch?

03:28.700 --> 03:31.867
Listen. I'm in here with yous
lot,
not getting any action.

03:31.933 --> 03:33.600
I need to get kicks somewhere.

03:33.667 --> 03:36.900
I feel like last night was
the worst food fight I've been
in.

03:36.967 --> 03:39.667
I need to go and see what
this is about. I'll come.

03:39.733 --> 03:42.967
I'm just gonna close me eyes
and hope it's OK.

03:43.033 --> 03:44.700
Fucking hell.

03:45.600 --> 03:48.900
Oh, my God.
This place is a shithole.

03:48.967 --> 03:50.867
Whoa, this is my dream pigsty.

03:50.933 --> 03:54.167
Everyone else is moaning
about the mess but I am not
arsed.

03:54.233 --> 03:56.000
This is my natural habitat.

03:56.067 --> 03:59.500
Right, come on then, guys,
let's fucking get cracking on.

04:01.400 --> 04:04.200
Quick, get in.
Oh, hit the post!

04:04.267 --> 04:07.800
Fuck this cleaning bollocks.
Me and Chloe have been getting
close

04:07.867 --> 04:10.433
and there's something
I need to get off my chest.

04:10.500 --> 04:12.567
You're not ending it, are you?

04:12.633 --> 04:15.600
What's this all about?
Sam looks dead serious.

04:15.667 --> 04:18.933
I just hope this is a plan
to get me and him out of
cleaning.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.899
Whoa, that's a bit hard.
Are you comfy?

04:21.966 --> 04:23.033
Yeah, why?

04:23.100 --> 04:24.833
I've been seeing how things go,

04:24.900 --> 04:27.367
but I did wanna take you away
from everybody

04:27.433 --> 04:30.300
so it's not embarrassing
cos I don't feel like

04:30.367 --> 04:32.933
we should continue anymore.
What?

04:33.000 --> 04:34.733
Like, me and you.

04:34.800 --> 04:35.933
You being serious?

04:36.000 --> 04:39.467
It's not like, not in a nasty
way
but, like, I just...

04:39.533 --> 04:40.800
What?!
(laughs)

04:40.867 --> 04:43.433
You're joking, aren't you?
Yeah, I'm joking.

04:43.500 --> 04:46.267
(sighs) Fuck me, I had
a pure sweat on there, like.

04:46.333 --> 04:48.633
Wasn't funny.
(laughs)

04:48.700 --> 04:51.067
When I was saying
I want to take you out,

04:51.133 --> 04:54.133
I actually really do,
if you wanna go on a second
date.

04:54.200 --> 04:57.933
Woo-hoo! Sam wants a second
date.
Play it cool, Chloe,

04:58.000 --> 04:59.467
play it very cool.

04:59.533 --> 05:01.700
Yeah, where?
It's a surprise again.

05:01.767 --> 05:04.700
I can't wait to take Chloe
on a proper official date.

05:04.767 --> 05:07.833
We get on like a house on fire.
She's fit as fuck

05:07.900 --> 05:10.800
and she makes me laugh.
What more could I want?

05:10.867 --> 05:12.767
Gonna be sat down in a
restaurant.

05:12.833 --> 05:16.067
Does this mean that I need to
get
all dressed up?

05:16.133 --> 05:18.267
I feel we should both
make an effort.

05:18.333 --> 05:22.633
I have never in my whole entire
life
been taken to a restaurant by a
boy.

05:22.700 --> 05:26.300
I'm really excited
but I'm nervous at the same
time.

05:30.133 --> 05:33.433
Finally, the house is tidy
and I need a freshen up too.

05:33.500 --> 05:36.200
So Sam, me and you
are going for a haircut.

05:37.233 --> 05:38.433
Bye, bitches!

05:40.367 --> 05:42.433
I'm buzzing.
What for?

05:42.500 --> 05:45.433
Cos Sam said to us he wanted
to take us on a second date.

05:45.500 --> 05:47.333
Aww! Where you gonna go then?

05:47.400 --> 05:49.533
I think I might be going
to a restaurant.

05:49.600 --> 05:52.300
Imagine it was this top five
star
restaurant.

05:52.367 --> 05:54.800
Violinist in the corner
with a fucking harp.

05:54.867 --> 05:57.100
What's a harp?
It's like a big, big flute

05:57.167 --> 05:59.067
where you do that.
Oh, harp.

05:59.133 --> 06:00.500
A harp, aye, harp.

06:00.567 --> 06:04.700
I am happy for Chloe, obviously,
but
I'm gonna keep out of her way
today

06:04.767 --> 06:08.133
cos this has just reminded me
that I'm still single.

06:08.200 --> 06:12.533
Fuck that lot, it's time for me
to get ready for my date.

06:12.600 --> 06:15.900
# I'm going on a date
I'm going on a date #

06:24.100 --> 06:25.767
Sam is like my little brother.

06:25.833 --> 06:29.667
What better way of taking him
under
my wing than keeping him fresh?

06:29.733 --> 06:30.900
Look good, kid.

06:30.967 --> 06:34.200
You've shaved up there, sorted.
What about down there?

06:34.267 --> 06:37.233
How you feeling?
I'm excited more than nervous.

06:37.300 --> 06:39.067
Isn't just so you can shag her?

06:39.133 --> 06:42.467
Wouldn't be taking her on dates
if I just wanted to shag her.

06:42.533 --> 06:44.833
This is more than just a shag
for Sam.

06:44.900 --> 06:47.133
That makes me extremely happy
for Chloe

06:47.200 --> 06:50.000
cos it's all the boys in the
past
ever wanted to do.

06:50.067 --> 06:52.267
I'm very convinced
it's more than sex.

06:52.333 --> 06:55.400
Yous are gonna get married
before we leave the house.

06:55.467 --> 06:57.367
Or you're gonna put a ring on
her.

06:57.433 --> 06:59.567
No rings happening
for the time being.

06:59.633 --> 07:02.367
But your willy's gonna go
in her ring. (laughs)

07:02.433 --> 07:05.100
Tonight might be your lucky
night.
Do you think?

07:05.167 --> 07:09.200
Nathan reckons tonight could
finally
be the night. Fingers crossed.

07:09.267 --> 07:12.867
But my main priority is giving
Chloe
a proper good date.

07:12.933 --> 07:14.500
I'm gonna wine and dine her.

07:14.567 --> 07:16.333
And then 69 her.

07:19.467 --> 07:23.100
Chloe's never ever been took
on a romantic dinner date.

07:23.167 --> 07:25.467
She needs to give Sam
some sex appeal.

07:25.533 --> 07:29.633
And what better way to tempt him
than to eat her steak

07:29.700 --> 07:31.500
like she's eating the cock.

07:31.567 --> 07:35.367
Tease the cock, tease the cock.
OK. Tease it, OK. Tease it.

07:36.500 --> 07:40.233
Get your straw and have a drink.
Imagine that's the penis too.

07:40.300 --> 07:41.333
Suck it.

07:42.333 --> 07:43.333
Like that?

07:43.400 --> 07:46.900
I didn't realise there's this
much
pressure to go on a date.

07:46.967 --> 07:49.900
I just hope I don't fuck it up
cos I do really like Sam.

07:49.967 --> 07:51.567
There's a lot to take in.

07:51.633 --> 07:53.967
That's why I've never been
on a date meself.

07:57.067 --> 07:58.433
Hello!

07:58.500 --> 08:00.567
Sam is back from the barbers
already

08:00.633 --> 08:03.133
and I've not even
brushed me fucking gnashers.

08:03.200 --> 08:05.167
Time for me to get a move on.

08:06.900 --> 08:09.700
Sam needs a man chat to prep him
for his date.

08:09.767 --> 08:11.600
Where's Aaron when you need him?

08:11.667 --> 08:15.133
I might not have a cock
but I have certainly got balls.

08:15.200 --> 08:17.467
So it looks like it's down to
me.

08:17.533 --> 08:19.900
Are you nervous?
No, I know what I'm doing.

08:19.967 --> 08:21.000
I'm not nervous.

08:21.067 --> 08:24.767
I'm pretending I'm not that
nervous
when really beneath the surface

08:24.833 --> 08:26.400
my legs are like that.

08:26.467 --> 08:29.133
The other boys just fucked
around
in this house.

08:29.200 --> 08:32.366
This time round I've seen a
totally
different side to Chloe.

08:32.433 --> 08:35.000
You need to treat her well
because if you don't,

08:35.067 --> 08:38.100
there's people in this house
that'll cut your dick off.

08:38.167 --> 08:41.167
I would not be making all this
effort to fuck her over.

08:41.232 --> 08:42.967
What do people not understand?

08:43.033 --> 08:45.533
I don't want my dick cutting
off.
I would...

08:45.600 --> 08:46.867
It would really hurt.

08:46.933 --> 08:49.233
I'll cut it off
and use it as a lampshade.

08:49.300 --> 08:51.433
It's not big enough.
Is it not?

08:51.500 --> 08:54.167
You don't want to tell her that.
It's really big.

08:54.233 --> 08:56.533
Good.
Really big. Tell me it's really
big.

08:56.600 --> 09:00.167
No, it's all right. I don't need
to
tell you your dick's really big.

09:00.233 --> 09:01.867
(laughs)

09:12.433 --> 09:14.833
Here to bring you
a glass of Dutch courage.

09:14.900 --> 09:16.300
What kind of drink's that?

09:16.367 --> 09:20.033
It's wine. It's gonna help you.
Loosen up and be brave, not
scared.

09:20.100 --> 09:23.433
Can you just cleanse me mind,
get us thinking positive things.

09:23.500 --> 09:26.267
Say this. You're beautiful.
I'm beautiful.

09:26.333 --> 09:29.700
You are beautiful. You are
smart.

09:29.767 --> 09:32.700
That's a lie, you are not.
At least I'm trying.

09:32.767 --> 09:35.200
Worth being loved.
I'm worth being loved.

09:35.267 --> 09:36.700
Gorgeous.
I'm gorgeous.

09:36.767 --> 09:40.467
Not all men are dicks.
Not all men are dicks.

09:40.533 --> 09:42.233
There we go.

09:42.300 --> 09:45.367
It's nice to talk to Nathan
cos he knows me so well.

09:45.433 --> 09:48.400
I've been messed around
by so many boys in this house.

09:48.467 --> 09:50.267
I hope to God Sam is different.

09:50.333 --> 09:51.600
Hello.
Little date?

09:51.667 --> 09:54.200
Yeah.
Haway then. You look really
nice.

09:54.267 --> 09:55.500
So do you.

09:55.567 --> 09:58.267
Yous, how nice do they look?
Wow.

09:58.333 --> 10:02.400
I am like a proud dad. It's like
sending my little girl off to
prom.

10:02.467 --> 10:06.567
They look perfect together.
It's like Barbie and fucking
Ken.

10:06.633 --> 10:09.367
Chloe! Remember what I said.

10:09.433 --> 10:11.167
Chloe looks a million dollars.

10:11.233 --> 10:14.167
I feel this could be the start
of something special.

10:14.233 --> 10:15.733
See yous later.

10:15.800 --> 10:17.800
Let's do this, bitches.

10:17.867 --> 10:20.800
You like chickens, yeah?
Chicken fucking Cottage?

10:20.867 --> 10:22.267
We get objects to shove up?

10:22.333 --> 10:25.000
That horny, I'm considering
fucking the pizza.

10:25.067 --> 10:27.333
That was quicker than expected.

10:27.400 --> 10:29.500
Shag pad, now.

10:29.567 --> 10:31.967
Geordie Shore, way-aye!

10:34.000 --> 10:34.200
.

10:36.733 --> 10:36.933
.

10:46.467 --> 10:48.800
With Chloe and Sam on their way
to the date,

10:48.867 --> 10:52.567
it's time for me and the girls
to get
ready. Let's do this, bitches.

10:52.633 --> 10:53.733
(cheering)

10:57.367 --> 10:59.933
We're already missing
Aaron and Marnie,

11:00.000 --> 11:02.400
now we're down to four
without Sam and Chloe.

11:02.467 --> 11:05.300
We are gonna have to up our game
tonight.

11:09.367 --> 11:14.500
The club's banging. I can feel
it in
my waters, tonight is gonna be
mint.

11:25.100 --> 11:28.800
Before she left on her date,
that girl was shitting herself.

11:28.867 --> 11:30.733
It's obvious she likes him.

11:42.167 --> 11:45.967
There's never been a
relationship
in this house that's worked out.

11:46.033 --> 11:49.633
I'm keeping me fingers, me toes
and me noo-noo crossed

11:49.700 --> 11:54.000
that they'll be the ones
to finally find love.

12:05.500 --> 12:08.400
We're on the way to our date
and I am so nervous.

12:08.467 --> 12:11.967
I just want to know where we're
going. The waiting is killing
us!

12:13.400 --> 12:17.567
We're nearly there and she's a
bit
quiet, which is making me
nervous.

12:17.633 --> 12:21.033
I hope she can't feel how much
me hands are sweating.

12:24.433 --> 12:29.233
I know how much you like
chicken,
so.

12:29.300 --> 12:31.500
Let's go, you're lying.

12:31.567 --> 12:32.767
Is this a joke?

12:32.833 --> 12:37.267
This has gotta be a joke.
Chicken fucking Cottage?

12:37.333 --> 12:40.033
We're going to Chicken Cottage.
Are you joking?

12:40.100 --> 12:41.433
You love chicken.

12:41.500 --> 12:45.133
This is not a joke. You told me
your favourite food was chicken.

12:45.200 --> 12:47.367
Wait till you see what's in my
bag.

12:47.433 --> 12:49.867
I've heard you like it.
Yes, I love chicken,

12:49.933 --> 12:51.567
but not on a fucking date!

12:51.633 --> 12:56.900
Don't get us wrong, I love
chicken.
But I was not expecting this,
like.

12:56.967 --> 12:59.000
I'm in a little bit of shock.

12:59.067 --> 13:02.533
I'm wearing a very expensive
tight dress what I can't breathe
in

13:02.600 --> 13:03.633
for a date with you.

13:03.700 --> 13:08.567
I cannot believe I am wearing
this dress, this fucking dress,

13:08.633 --> 13:11.400
in a chicken shop! What a waste!

13:11.467 --> 13:13.433
Know what I've been doing?
What?

13:13.500 --> 13:15.400
Practising how to fucking eat.

13:15.467 --> 13:17.767
Gonna tell you before I start.
Eat wrongly.

13:17.833 --> 13:19.833
I've been worried about this all
day.

13:19.900 --> 13:22.600
I put that there and then
pull with that like that.

13:22.667 --> 13:25.100
So happy you said that
cos I use this fucker.

13:25.167 --> 13:27.000
We've got so much in common.

13:27.067 --> 13:30.367
What Chloe doesn't realise is
I've been nervous all day too.

13:30.433 --> 13:32.667
Cos I just want this date
to go well.

13:32.733 --> 13:35.367
Look at the menu,
you are spoilt for choice.

13:35.433 --> 13:36.567
Types of chicken.

13:36.633 --> 13:38.767
What type are you gonna go for?
Nugget.

13:38.833 --> 13:41.167
I don't think they do
chicken nuggets.

13:41.233 --> 13:45.700
No chicken nuggets? In a fucking
chicken shop? What the chicking
hell?

13:45.767 --> 13:49.867
I think they've got everything
but.
That's the only chicken like.

13:49.933 --> 13:53.167
I don't think Chloe appreciates
the effort that I've put in.

13:53.233 --> 13:56.500
There's toilet roll, candles,
even knives and forks.

13:56.567 --> 13:59.533
What more does she want?
I know, compliments.

13:59.600 --> 14:01.967
You look really nice, I fancy
ya.
I fancy you.

14:02.033 --> 14:05.833
I'm really enjoying getting to
know
you more. If it keeps continuing

14:05.900 --> 14:08.433
the way it is,
who knows what's gonna happen.

14:08.500 --> 14:11.800
You're getting nervous,
you're biting your straw.

14:11.867 --> 14:15.400
Sam is saying the sweetest
things
and it's making us speechless.

14:15.467 --> 14:18.867
Everyone knows me as a loud
person
and I never ever get shy

14:18.933 --> 14:21.933
but once I'm around a boy I
fancy,
I'm fucking weird.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.733
(laughs)

14:23.800 --> 14:26.033
This doesn't turn you off?
It turns me on.

14:26.100 --> 14:28.400
Really?
A little bit.

14:28.467 --> 14:32.200
What does that look like?
What does that look like?
(laughs)

14:32.267 --> 14:35.767
Who'd have thought a chicken
restaurant could be so sexual?

14:35.833 --> 14:36.833
Love this place.

14:36.900 --> 14:39.467
I'm happy, Sam,
that you've brought us here now.

14:39.533 --> 14:42.867
I've pulled it out the bag?
Yes. You've thought what I like.

14:42.933 --> 14:45.233
I feel like Sam has definitely
put me first

14:45.300 --> 14:48.467
and his thoughtfulness
has made me feel so happy.

14:48.533 --> 14:51.933
I like you. I like you a lot.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.200
Why's your head facing the
floor?

14:54.267 --> 14:57.033
When I like someone I'm very,
like...

14:57.100 --> 14:58.400
Like a shy kid?
Yeah.

15:01.133 --> 15:03.900
After being treated so badly
in the past by boys,

15:03.967 --> 15:06.200
it's so hard for me
to put meself out there

15:06.267 --> 15:08.767
and actually tell Sam
how much I like him.

15:12.600 --> 15:15.067
I thought I'd fucked it at first

15:15.133 --> 15:18.567
but in the end she actually
liked
the date. Thank fuck for that.

15:18.633 --> 15:19.900
Now let's get to the club

15:19.967 --> 15:23.467
because we've got some serious
catching up to do on the drink.

15:23.533 --> 15:26.300
Oh! Lovebirds!

15:26.367 --> 15:29.133
Here they are, young love's
dream.
Hand in hand.

15:29.200 --> 15:30.900
Tell us how the date went then.

15:41.867 --> 15:44.000
He promised us
it would be five star.

15:44.067 --> 15:47.433
What chicken shop in Newcastle
is five fucking star?

15:58.000 --> 16:01.067
I'm pretending I can't hear
Chloe
say that she likes Sam

16:01.133 --> 16:05.167
but I want her to say it louder
and louder so he hears.

16:09.267 --> 16:13.233
Sam has just said he likes us
and I just told him I liked him.

16:13.300 --> 16:14.567
(giggles)

16:16.400 --> 16:21.133
The family's back together so
let's
have a fucking belter of a
night.

16:21.200 --> 16:22.200
(all) Cheers!

16:33.100 --> 16:37.733
Chloe and Sam look so cute.
Their
date must have gone really well.

16:37.800 --> 16:39.767
I just wish that I was that
happy.

16:42.567 --> 16:45.300
We're all having a wicked night
except for Abbie.

16:45.367 --> 16:49.233
She looks miserable.
And if this is about Sam and
Chloe,

16:49.300 --> 16:52.100
she needs to let it go
and just be happy for them.

16:53.133 --> 16:56.633
Sam and Chloe are all over each
other. I wanna be happy for
them,

16:56.700 --> 17:00.500
but I'm finding it difficult.
It's
making me sad cos it's reminding
me

17:00.567 --> 17:02.100
that I wanna be in love too.

17:17.666 --> 17:20.900
I hate seeing Abbie getting
upset.
We've grown so close,

17:20.967 --> 17:22.467
she's like a sister to us.

17:27.700 --> 17:31.467
I know everyone is gonna think
that
I'm crying over Chloe and Sam

17:31.533 --> 17:35.433
but it's not that. I'm upset
because
I feel like every time I like
someone

17:35.500 --> 17:37.267
in this house, they mug us off.

17:42.733 --> 17:45.267
I'm so glad I've got Steph
to cheer us up

17:45.333 --> 17:48.867
cos everyone else only seems to
be
bothered about Sam and Chloe.

17:51.467 --> 17:55.100
Abbie needs me to be there for
her.
So I'm gonna take her on the
pull

17:55.167 --> 17:56.800
to take her mind off things.

18:04.500 --> 18:07.567
Sophie's seen Abbie heading
into the crowd crying.

18:07.633 --> 18:11.700
Hopefully, she's gonna find
a nice boy to wipe away those
tears.

18:22.333 --> 18:25.833
Finally, a fit lad
and he's just Abbie's type.

18:25.900 --> 18:27.500
Get yourself in there, girl.

18:31.667 --> 18:34.933
This lad is even fitter than
Sam.
I'm cracking on.

18:44.600 --> 18:48.033
Abbie doesn't hang about.
Now she's all over this fitty.

18:48.100 --> 18:51.967
But if that's what it takes
to stop these tears, then crack
on.

18:58.033 --> 19:01.767
This lad has cheered me right
up.
This is exactly what I needed.

19:01.833 --> 19:05.500
So I'm gonna continue the good
vibes
and bring him back to the house.

19:10.533 --> 19:15.200
I'm dead proud of Abbie pulling,
but
I'm so mortal. I need to get to
bed.

19:15.267 --> 19:17.500
I cannot keep up with this lot.

19:21.267 --> 19:24.933
Right, lad. Fancy meeting the
twins?
Shag pad now.

19:31.033 --> 19:34.833
Tonight has been unbelievable.
I feel closer than ever to Chloe

19:34.900 --> 19:38.400
and I've still got
one more surprise for her.

19:38.467 --> 19:42.467
Oh, my God, matching cozzies!
Relationship goals!

19:42.533 --> 19:45.500
Sam has just said he's got
one more surprise for us.

19:45.567 --> 19:47.533
Jesus Christ! I feel pure
special!

19:51.500 --> 19:54.633
This is different to how I've
been
with any other girl

19:54.700 --> 19:57.533
and I think tonight
could be the night.

19:58.900 --> 20:03.167
Wow. I can't believe tonight.
I have been made to feel so
special.

20:03.233 --> 20:05.267
I feel like Sam could be the
one.

20:08.767 --> 20:11.367
A fucking firework! (laughs)

20:11.433 --> 20:14.867
Hopefully, my cock will be doing
the same as this cork tonight.

20:14.933 --> 20:17.200
Fizzing from the top. (laughs)

20:17.267 --> 20:20.767
Do you know what?
I don't even like champagne.

20:20.833 --> 20:24.733
Fuck the Bucks Fizz, I'm gonna
go
straight in for a neck on.

20:24.800 --> 20:26.600
Because I'm horny!

20:29.333 --> 20:33.500
This is getting very, very
intimate
and I'm getting really, really
wet.

20:33.567 --> 20:37.133
I don't know if it's the wetness
from the hot tub or from me
fanny.

20:38.400 --> 20:41.400
This necking on in the hot tub
has got me hot and steamy.

20:41.467 --> 20:43.833
I think it's time to go to bed.

20:44.733 --> 20:47.433
Oh, my God. I think I know
what's about to happen.

20:47.500 --> 20:49.767
But why am I so nervous?

20:49.833 --> 20:52.500
How lucky are them two
that they get to shag?

20:52.567 --> 20:53.667
She makes me so sad.

20:55.833 --> 21:00.333
I'm that horny right now,
I'm considering fucking the
pizza.

21:00.400 --> 21:03.867
I wanna get my boyfriend, get
him and squeeze him so he
explodes

21:03.933 --> 21:07.533
with come all over my body so I
feel
like I've had a massive bukkake

21:07.600 --> 21:09.267
and no-one wants to know that.

21:09.333 --> 21:12.333
All this sex talk is doing
something funny to me fanny.

21:12.400 --> 21:16.500
I don't think I can help meself.
I'm
gonna have to go and perv on
Abbie.

21:18.833 --> 21:21.400
I know Sophie and Nathan
are really horny,

21:21.467 --> 21:23.467
but this is getting a bit weird.

21:25.233 --> 21:28.800
Fuck! Play dead! Play dead!
She can't say anything.

21:28.867 --> 21:29.900
Oh!

21:33.767 --> 21:37.600
I'm bored of this. I'm actually
going to bed to touch meself.

21:39.333 --> 21:41.833
All these dates
have been leading up to this.

21:41.900 --> 21:44.800
I'm finally naked in bed with
Chloe.

21:44.867 --> 21:47.700
And I think we're about to have
sex.

21:52.133 --> 21:55.567
Hallelujah!
Me and Sam are actually doing
it!

21:55.633 --> 21:57.800
We're making sweet, sweet love.

22:02.033 --> 22:05.267
That was quicker than expected
but you know what?

22:05.333 --> 22:08.200
It was incredible
and what a way to end our night.

22:13.000 --> 22:16.667
After tonight, I do feel like me
and Sam have got something
special.

22:16.733 --> 22:19.700
But he was a little bit quick
though.

22:19.767 --> 22:21.333
Good morning!

22:21.400 --> 22:24.167
I had sex.
We're going to play bingo.

22:24.233 --> 22:25.800
Favourite number?
69.

22:25.867 --> 22:29.667
This is the best idea you've
had.
We just needed a bit of
attention.

22:29.733 --> 22:31.233
Oh, my God.

22:31.300 --> 22:34.400
Spruce yourself up.
I'll be here just washing my
fanny.

22:34.467 --> 22:36.233
Geordie Shore, way-aye!

22:38.467 --> 22:38.667
.

22:41.167 --> 22:41.367
.

22:57.467 --> 22:59.467
Good morning!

22:59.533 --> 23:03.000
I woke up in such a jolly mood
this morning. You know why?

23:03.067 --> 23:04.600
Cos last night I had sex.

23:04.667 --> 23:06.400
So what happened when I got
back?

23:06.467 --> 23:09.667
We worked our way upstairs.
And made love.

23:09.733 --> 23:11.867
And made love.
No, yous didn't.

23:11.933 --> 23:13.133
We did.
Eventually.

23:13.200 --> 23:14.700
He come, like, in seconds.

23:14.767 --> 23:18.300
All right, it might have been
quick
but you weren't complaining.

23:18.367 --> 23:21.500
You should take it as a
compliment
you made me come so quick.

23:21.567 --> 23:25.100
Are yous gonna go any further?
What do you mean, like, in the
arse?

23:25.167 --> 23:28.733
(laughs) It's not going in me
arse,
I'm saving that for me husband.

23:28.800 --> 23:30.800
I'm gonna be sick.

23:31.633 --> 23:35.267
(vomiting noise) Oh, my God.
I really, really don't feel
right.

23:38.367 --> 23:41.000
I feel fucking brilliant
for getting a shag.

23:41.067 --> 23:45.733
But sorry, lad, you've gotta
leave
cos I need to go tell the
others.

23:45.800 --> 23:48.233
Morning.
Oi-oi, shagger!

23:48.300 --> 23:50.800
(all chanting) Shagger! Shagger!

23:50.867 --> 23:52.433
I am pure buzzing for Abbie.

23:52.500 --> 23:55.767
We've both had a man
and it wasn't the same one.
Winning!

23:55.833 --> 23:57.733
It's all worked in the end.

23:57.800 --> 24:00.900
Was it a good one?
It was a good one, you know.

24:00.967 --> 24:03.400
Mine wasn't, mine was a second
long.

24:03.467 --> 24:07.133
Exactly what Abbie needed,
after the way she was feeling.

24:07.200 --> 24:10.367
Abbie, did it make you feel
better?
Like, last night.

24:10.433 --> 24:12.033
What do you mean, feel better?

24:12.100 --> 24:14.667
When yous came I got a bit down
because I felt...

24:14.733 --> 24:18.000
Why?
I'd seen how happy yous two were

24:18.067 --> 24:21.067
and it just made me a bit, like,
why can't I be like that?

24:21.133 --> 24:24.633
What? Abbie got upset?
I feel so uncomfortable now.

24:24.700 --> 24:27.700
I thought this was all sorted,
for fuck's sake, man.

24:27.767 --> 24:30.133
Me and Sam don't want you
to feel down.

24:30.200 --> 24:33.367
If we are affecting you,
we'd never want you to feel
that.

24:33.433 --> 24:37.033
I didn't want Sam and Chloe to
know
that I got upset last night

24:37.100 --> 24:40.533
cos they're really happy
and it'll make things awkward.

24:40.600 --> 24:43.000
All I can hear this morning
is Chloe's voice.

24:43.067 --> 24:45.833
She's had sex.
I'm happy for her but I hate
her.

24:45.900 --> 24:47.567
I'm a very bitter, bitter man.

24:47.633 --> 24:50.233
Everyone's shagging is making me
very jealous.

24:50.300 --> 24:54.033
And that perving last night
has left me very unsatisfied.

24:54.100 --> 24:57.100
If I actually came now,
there's enough sperm in my body

24:57.167 --> 25:00.633
to get the whole of Newcastle
pregnant. Really? That's a lot.

25:00.700 --> 25:03.400
Nathan, keep your bodily fluids
to yourself

25:03.467 --> 25:07.633
and let's get some breakfast
before you ruin my appetite.

25:07.700 --> 25:09.833
Come for breakfast!
I'm Hank Marvin.

25:09.900 --> 25:11.300
Nathan, you're cooking.

25:11.367 --> 25:14.400
Nathan. What came first,
the cock or the clit?

25:14.467 --> 25:15.933
I know this answer.

25:16.000 --> 25:19.500
So everyone, your cock
is an actual fallen out clit.

25:19.567 --> 25:21.700
Fuck off!
What?

25:21.767 --> 25:25.200
Does that mean all men are
girls?
Does that mean I'm a lesbian?

25:25.267 --> 25:26.633
(phone rings)
Phone!

25:26.700 --> 25:29.700
There's only one person
annoying enough

25:29.767 --> 25:31.867
to call us this early
in the morning.

25:31.933 --> 25:35.133
And that's that wicked witch
of the North. Fucking Anna.

25:35.200 --> 25:37.567
Hello?
"Hi, Steph. How's things going?"

25:37.633 --> 25:38.900
Going good, yeah.

25:38.967 --> 25:42.100
"I need you, Abbie and Sam
to work today." OK.

25:42.167 --> 25:44.233
"And yous lot will be
hosting bingo."

25:44.300 --> 25:45.800
Bingo?

25:45.867 --> 25:47.367
We're going to play bingo.

25:47.433 --> 25:49.833
(cheering)
Only me, Abbie and Sam though.

25:49.900 --> 25:51.867
Fuck's sake, I'm not 103.

25:51.933 --> 25:53.700
I think I've been to bingo once

25:53.767 --> 25:57.900
and I was the youngest person
there
by about 100 fucking years.

26:00.700 --> 26:01.933
Tell us the gossip.

26:02.000 --> 26:04.533
Feel like you've caught
feelings?
Yes.

26:04.600 --> 26:09.267
I have caught so many feelings
right
now. It's uncomfortable how
many.

26:09.333 --> 26:10.867
Did you come?
No.

26:10.933 --> 26:13.167
He come too quick,
Like, fuck's sake.

26:13.233 --> 26:15.233
I feel... I find that very
selfish.

26:15.300 --> 26:17.767
There he is! There's the big
boy.

26:17.833 --> 26:20.033
Sam's going to work.
I don't want him to go.

26:20.100 --> 26:21.800
I miss his little face already.

26:21.867 --> 26:24.267
See yous after.
Have fun. Bye!

26:24.333 --> 26:27.067
How're you gonna feel he's going
to work with Abbie?

26:27.133 --> 26:29.300
You know she was crying last
night.

26:29.367 --> 26:32.933
Cos you and Sam went on a date.
And cos yous are happy.

26:33.000 --> 26:34.500
I can't be arsed with this.

26:34.567 --> 26:38.433
Abbie said she got a little bit
down,
not she was bawling her eyes
out.

26:38.500 --> 26:42.200
Must be worse than I thought.
Last
thing I want is to make her cry.

26:42.267 --> 26:46.033
Why don't we go to get massages?
I'm gonna put nice pants on.

26:46.100 --> 26:50.433
Sophie is the world's best
friend.
Me and her are gonna relax

26:50.500 --> 26:52.967
and get a nice little massage.

26:53.033 --> 26:56.067
Spruce up, get dolled up.
Don't be overthinking.

26:56.133 --> 26:58.600
I'll be here just washing my
fanny.

26:58.667 --> 27:02.000
Nathan's telling me not to
overthink
things but how can I not?

27:02.067 --> 27:05.900
I'm stuck here all alone when I
know
Abbie was crying last night.

27:05.967 --> 27:10.167
What the fuck am I supposed to
do? At
least tell us where your
vibrator is.

27:19.633 --> 27:21.733
All right. Nice to meet you.
Hello.

27:21.800 --> 27:25.133
We've arrived at the bingo.
The people in here are so old.

27:25.200 --> 27:27.233
We need to liven this place up.

27:27.300 --> 27:30.333
What we doing? Presenting bingo?
Yes, doing the bingo.

27:30.400 --> 27:33.367
Why the fuck has Anna sent us
here?

27:33.433 --> 27:36.367
That button to pick numbers.
Need a GCSE to work that.

27:36.433 --> 27:38.033
Favourite numbers?
69.

27:38.100 --> 27:41.000
I was gonna say that.
(laughter)

27:41.067 --> 27:43.800
We've all had a 69, let's be
honest.

27:43.867 --> 27:46.633
I knew old people still love the
69.

27:46.700 --> 27:50.000
We ready to play some bingo?
(all agree)

27:52.000 --> 27:54.067
Seven and four, 74.

27:56.433 --> 27:58.333
41, wearing a thong.

27:59.733 --> 28:01.900
Five and one, 51.

28:03.067 --> 28:04.733
45, staying alive.

28:07.467 --> 28:10.833
Right, Steph, it's your turn
now.
Too much flirting going on.

28:10.900 --> 28:13.467
Now that Steph's on the mic,
I wanna chat to Sam.

28:13.533 --> 28:17.200
When I told him and Chloe I got
upset, they didn't understand
why.

28:17.267 --> 28:20.267
I just don't want him to get
the wrong end of the stick.

28:20.333 --> 28:23.533
I got upset last night
because I had a lot of drink

28:23.600 --> 28:26.900
but I think people think
that I'm upset over you.

28:26.967 --> 28:30.167
It's not you, I got upset...
Do you feel like I rejected you?

28:30.233 --> 28:33.367
In the past I've been rejected
by lads. When you're a girl

28:33.433 --> 28:36.633
and you're like, "No-one wants
us,"
and that's what it was.

28:36.700 --> 28:39.900
I don't want Sam thinking
me getting upset was over him.

28:39.967 --> 28:43.600
It was about the situation and
me
feeling like no-one wants us.

28:43.667 --> 28:47.267
If it was between the two of
yous,
I couldn't choose between yous.

28:47.333 --> 28:52.700
It's the fact that I think on a
more,
what's that word? On a more,
like...

28:52.767 --> 28:55.100
Same level?
Civil level.

28:55.167 --> 28:57.900
Civil?
Civil level, me and, erm,

28:57.967 --> 29:00.500
me and Chloe are like better
suited,
I think.

29:00.567 --> 29:03.133
I didn't know
Abbie felt like I rejected her.

29:03.200 --> 29:04.800
All I wanna do is reassure her,

29:04.867 --> 29:07.533
make sure she doesn't feel hurt
or let down by me.

29:07.600 --> 29:11.200
I don't want you thinking you
got
rejected cos that wasn't the
case.

29:11.267 --> 29:13.667
I feel like last night
made us feel better.

29:13.733 --> 29:14.833
Does it?
Yeah.

29:14.900 --> 29:16.867
Bit of a confidence boost?
Yeah.

29:16.933 --> 29:18.800
Cos you had a cock in you?
(laughs)

29:18.867 --> 29:20.533
How long was the cock in you
for?

29:20.600 --> 29:23.300
I don't know.
Probably longer than you did.

29:23.367 --> 29:26.567
Abbie's bantering us which makes
me
think she must be fine.

29:26.633 --> 29:30.600
I don't want anything disrupting
how well me and Chloe are
getting on.

29:30.667 --> 29:33.800
Eight and two, 82.
Howay!

29:33.867 --> 29:38.367
You said 82, did you?
We've got a line! (cheering)

29:38.433 --> 29:41.000
The bingo, surprisingly,
has been a good day.

29:41.067 --> 29:45.033
Let's get back to the house and
tell
everybody what old people are
like.

29:47.700 --> 29:51.433
I'm so bored and all I can think
about is how Abbie got upset.

29:51.500 --> 29:54.067
I just don't know what to do.
It's killing us.

29:54.133 --> 29:56.833
I've shaved everywhere
to take me mind off things.

29:56.900 --> 30:01.033
I need the others to hurry back
before I shave me fucking head
off.

30:03.033 --> 30:04.267
Come on, baby.

30:08.433 --> 30:11.833
We get to the massage parlour
and I can't wait for me and
Sophie

30:11.900 --> 30:15.500
to get all relaxed and relieve
some of this built up tension.

30:16.667 --> 30:18.567
The best idea you've ever had.

30:18.633 --> 30:20.000
It's a good one, isn't it?

30:20.067 --> 30:23.500
Yesterday, I was so turned on
by everything everyone was
doing.

30:23.567 --> 30:28.000
Seeing everyone shagging.
We just needed a bit of...

30:28.067 --> 30:29.633
...attention.
Connection.

30:29.700 --> 30:33.567
This is all we needed.
A little bit of human contact.

30:34.400 --> 30:37.100
I felt like Chloe was a bit
pissed off earlier.

30:37.167 --> 30:38.167
Why?

30:38.233 --> 30:41.900
Well, Sam's going out to work
with Abbie.

30:41.967 --> 30:44.400
I feel bad for Chloe
cos she's gonna be at home

30:44.467 --> 30:47.400
and she's just gonna be
overthinking things.

30:47.467 --> 30:51.067
Cos Chloe obviously cares about
Abbie. It's making Chloe feel
bad.

30:51.133 --> 30:52.433
I don't think it's fair.

30:52.500 --> 30:56.067
I understand Abbie might've been
annoyed but now that Sam and
Chloe

30:56.133 --> 30:58.733
are giving it a go,
she needs to be happy for them.

30:58.800 --> 31:02.100
Instead of crying and putting
a spanner in the works.

31:02.167 --> 31:05.333
I'm struggling to hold
a conversation with you right
now.

31:05.400 --> 31:08.433
Why?
I think my mind is somewhere
else.

31:08.500 --> 31:11.333
Where is it?
(laughs)

31:13.000 --> 31:17.133
Oh. This feels so good.
Just getting a nice little
rubdown.

31:17.200 --> 31:19.633
I really enjoy it. Thank you!
Bye.

31:19.700 --> 31:24.200
I feel like I'm refreshed,
energetic
and I feel like I've had a shag.

31:24.267 --> 31:26.300
Ooh!
I'll give you your happy ending.

31:26.367 --> 31:28.633
I've just had a massage. Oh!

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
Right, this is a joke now.

31:37.067 --> 31:41.100
Sam needs to get his skinny arse
home
and take my mind off Abbie.

31:41.167 --> 31:43.600
Hello!
Hello!

31:43.667 --> 31:46.367
Bingo was banging. It's got me
in the mood to party.

31:46.433 --> 31:49.033
So howay, Steph, let's go get
ready
for the toon.

31:49.100 --> 31:51.600
How was work?
It was good. We played bingo.

31:51.667 --> 31:55.133
But Abbie started saying last
night
she got emotional.

31:55.200 --> 31:59.367
I don't understand. It's put me
an
awkward position cos now I feel
like

31:59.433 --> 32:01.667
I've got to be wary.
Of what... yeah.

32:01.733 --> 32:03.800
It's about time that we forget
Abbie

32:03.867 --> 32:06.600
and remember
there's two in this
relationship.

32:06.667 --> 32:09.800
Yeah, it's awkward. It's
starting
to really stress us out.

32:09.867 --> 32:12.300
I literally don't know
what to do anymore.

32:12.367 --> 32:15.367
How can I be happy
when one of me best friends
isn't?

32:17.233 --> 32:18.767
That massage was great.

32:18.833 --> 32:21.500
But we need to crack on
and get ready for tonight.

32:21.567 --> 32:23.600
Hello!

32:39.133 --> 32:42.200
So, Chloe, are you gonna be
with Sam tonight or with us?

32:42.267 --> 32:44.733
I'm literally on cloud nine
at the minute.

32:44.800 --> 32:47.767
This is so awkward. I can't help
but feel really guilty,

32:47.833 --> 32:51.500
talking about how happy I am
with Sam
in front of Abbie. What do I do?

32:51.567 --> 32:53.967
How's your horniness, Sophie?
Got worse.

32:54.033 --> 32:56.400
I've had to put talc
on me fanny tonight

32:56.467 --> 32:58.567
cos I need it to dry up
all the moisture.

32:58.633 --> 33:02.167
I swear to God, girls. Get the
wet
floor signs out for me tonight.

33:02.233 --> 33:05.267
The only person that'll
sort this out is me lad.

33:05.333 --> 33:07.700
My boyfriend's not here
so I can't get a shag.

33:07.767 --> 33:11.167
I'm just gonna have to get so
mortal
and forget about it.

33:12.800 --> 33:17.267
Chloe was worried about you
spending
time with Abbie because she
cried.

33:17.333 --> 33:19.167
I was like, "Well, why?"

33:19.233 --> 33:23.200
Basically she was saying cos she
feels rejected that I chose
Chloe.

33:23.267 --> 33:26.900
I didn't actually choose
anybody.
I went with the person...

33:26.967 --> 33:29.000
Who you connected with the most.

33:29.067 --> 33:32.667
I don't think Sam realises this
is
the kind of shit that can cause

33:32.733 --> 33:36.633
the girls in this house to kick
off
and he's right in the firing
line.

33:36.700 --> 33:40.033
Tonight, right, family night.
No arguments whatsoever.

33:40.100 --> 33:42.900
The fact that Abbie has been
upset
is still on me mind

33:42.967 --> 33:46.200
but it's family night and I
wanna
get pissed. Let's go on the

33:46.267 --> 33:48.867
Puh, Eh, Vu, Vu, Eh. Peeve!

33:48.933 --> 33:51.933
To the family!
Family!

33:56.333 --> 33:59.700
Get me out this house.
You leave, that is me and you
done.

33:59.767 --> 34:01.300
Fucking shit!

34:02.600 --> 34:05.133
I'm now babysitting Sophie.

34:05.200 --> 34:07.533
I ruined something so special.

34:07.600 --> 34:09.900
Geordie Shore, way-aye!

34:12.933 --> 34:13.132
.

34:15.667 --> 34:15.867
.

34:25.533 --> 34:27.000
(cheering)

34:31.533 --> 34:34.632
We get to the club
and the music is bouncing.

34:34.699 --> 34:38.467
And the drinks are calling our
names.
So bring it on.

34:39.400 --> 34:42.400
Tonight is going to get very
messy.

34:42.467 --> 34:46.000
I just wish that Aaron and
Marnie
were here to enjoy it.

34:46.067 --> 34:47.766
After speaking to Sam earlier,

34:47.833 --> 34:50.433
I'm so glad we've put
all of that drama behind us.

34:50.500 --> 34:52.967
So tonight I wanna have
an unreal night.

35:03.533 --> 35:07.200
I'm trying to get into this
night
but I just feel like I can't.

35:09.200 --> 35:12.467
I feel bad for being happy.
Like, when I go out with Sam,

35:12.533 --> 35:15.800
I've always got to think about
her.
It shouldn't be like that.

35:46.333 --> 35:50.033
This is exactly what I didn't
want.
Things to get awkward.

35:50.100 --> 35:52.167
I knew no-one would understand.

36:05.533 --> 36:08.767
Abbie said she was crying
because she wants what we've
got.

36:08.833 --> 36:10.133
I'm just so confused.

36:15.367 --> 36:19.267
Chloe isn't listening to me. I
feel
like we're going 'round in
circles.

36:19.333 --> 36:21.067
This is so frustrating.

36:28.933 --> 36:30.267
Great. Sam's come over.

36:30.333 --> 36:33.333
Another person I'm gonna
have to defend myself to.

36:39.100 --> 36:41.900
Abbie says she's OK,
but I don't believe her.

36:41.967 --> 36:44.833
Mine and Sam's relationship
is hurting her.

36:51.800 --> 36:55.267
I've been hurt in the past in
this
house and it kills us to think

36:55.333 --> 36:57.133
I'm the cause of Abbie hurting.

36:57.200 --> 37:00.900
I need to do something about
this.
It's the last thing I want to
do.

37:08.700 --> 37:11.333
Why do you care about
Abbie's feelings so much?

37:11.400 --> 37:14.200
What about your feelings?
What about mine?

37:17.833 --> 37:20.100
That is not what I expected Sam
to do at all.

37:20.167 --> 37:24.033
I thought he'd understand, I was
just
trying to do the right thing.
Shit!

37:24.100 --> 37:25.567
What have I done?

37:29.133 --> 37:32.667
What you going on about? After
everything we've been through,

37:32.733 --> 37:35.467
everything I've done
to win you over. Fuck this.

37:37.100 --> 37:38.633
Everything was great.

37:38.700 --> 37:41.600
Now Abbie's tears have
got into Chloe's head

37:41.667 --> 37:43.100
and she's fucked it for us.

37:43.167 --> 37:45.933
I thought Abbie was fine now
so what is her problem?

37:51.400 --> 37:54.100
I'm so frustrated that
no-one is listening to me.

37:54.167 --> 37:57.500
If I have to explain myself
one more time, I might go
insane.

38:03.133 --> 38:07.667
This night has fallen flat
on its arse. It's just so
miserable.

38:10.667 --> 38:13.500
I am so fucking drunk tonight.
I don't know how.

38:13.567 --> 38:15.900
I don't even know
what the fuck is going on.

38:25.000 --> 38:26.800
Sam is obviously gutted.

38:26.867 --> 38:30.633
You only get that angry
over someone you really care
about.

38:30.700 --> 38:32.533
Tonight has been a shambles.

38:32.600 --> 38:36.867
Sophie's fucked, Abbie's crying,
Sam and Chloe are arguing.

38:36.933 --> 38:38.733
Think it's time we go home.

38:52.533 --> 38:55.700
Tonight did not go as planned.
It was fucking shit.

38:55.767 --> 38:58.400
I'm going to bed
before I get any more grief.

38:58.467 --> 39:01.300
This is a mess.
I thought I was doing the right
thing

39:01.367 --> 39:04.033
but Sam is ignoring us.
What the fuck have I done?

39:04.600 --> 39:06.033
Get me out of this house.

39:06.100 --> 39:09.400
First boy I could've seen
a future with. Now I've lost
him.

39:09.467 --> 39:11.500
That's it. I'm leaving this
house.

39:12.500 --> 39:14.767
I'm really sorry,
I can't close the door.

39:14.833 --> 39:19.133
On top of everything that's
happened
tonight, I'm now babysitting
Sophie.

39:19.200 --> 39:21.533
Gonna rest you there for a
second.

39:21.600 --> 39:24.667
I'm really drunk and I don't
even
know me own name.

39:24.733 --> 39:27.367
Usually when people are drunk,
they want a kebab.

39:29.333 --> 39:31.267
But I want me fucking dad.

39:31.333 --> 39:33.967
Gonna sort Chloe out
and I promise I'll be back.

39:40.400 --> 39:41.833
What's going on?

39:41.900 --> 39:46.467
I've just met someone
who I really, really like.

39:46.533 --> 39:48.467
I've just literally fucked it up

39:48.533 --> 39:51.467
because someone downstairs
fucking likes him.

39:51.533 --> 39:54.100
You haven't fucked things up.
I have.

39:54.167 --> 39:58.067
I've been treated like shit
in this fucking house!

39:58.133 --> 40:02.633
For fucking (indistinct)!
(continues shouting)

40:02.700 --> 40:03.767
Right, stop.

40:03.833 --> 40:07.300
Chloe's going bonkers and
it looks like she's packing her
bag.

40:07.367 --> 40:10.000
If she cares that much,
why would she want to leave

40:10.067 --> 40:11.967
and throw away everything we
have?

40:12.033 --> 40:16.167
Totally fucking got the wrong
end
of the stick, it's not fair.

40:16.233 --> 40:20.100
Chloe is going berserk upstairs
and it's all aimed at me.

40:20.167 --> 40:24.067
All I have done is want to make
sure
that Chloe was OK.

40:24.133 --> 40:27.667
I just want people to realise
where I'm coming from.

40:27.733 --> 40:29.733
I don't want to...

40:29.800 --> 40:33.867
I do really feel for the girl
but I
cannot understand what she's
saying.

40:33.933 --> 40:35.733
She sounds like a drowned dog.

40:35.800 --> 40:39.300
Never ever put someone
before yourself!

40:39.367 --> 40:42.933
I have lost something with
this...

40:43.000 --> 40:46.000
in here for someone downstairs,
right?!

40:46.067 --> 40:48.467
Sometimes you've gotta
put yourself first.

40:48.533 --> 40:51.800
I wish tonight I'd chosen Sam
and didn't think about Abbie.

40:51.867 --> 40:54.167
Now I feel like
I've lost him forever.

40:54.233 --> 40:58.567
The last time I ever will put
anyone
before us. Ever in me life!

40:58.633 --> 41:01.433
I have ruined something so
special.

41:01.500 --> 41:03.467
This is heart-breaking to see.

41:03.533 --> 41:05.767
Chloe found the boy
she's always wanted

41:05.833 --> 41:09.167
and then she's pushed him away
cos of a little tiny blip.

41:09.233 --> 41:12.100
I'm not gonna stop you
from going home if you want.

41:12.167 --> 41:13.367
You can do that.

41:13.433 --> 41:15.633
I can't stand this.
I need to talk to Sam.

41:15.700 --> 41:19.433
Maybe if he knows I'm willing to
walk
out, he might fight for us to
stay.

41:19.500 --> 41:21.467
Shut the door!

41:26.433 --> 41:29.767
I don't know how we've ended up
here. I've done nothing wrong.

41:29.833 --> 41:34.700
If you want out, I understand...
what is more important to you

41:34.767 --> 41:38.333
so therefore
I'll concentrate on myself.

41:38.400 --> 41:40.267
So if I leave, me and you are
done?

41:40.333 --> 41:44.800
If you leave this house, there's
no going back. We're done for
good.

41:44.867 --> 41:48.767
I cannot persuade you
whatsoever.
Only you know what you wanna do.

41:48.833 --> 41:51.800
And whatever decision you make,
that is fine. Simple.

41:51.867 --> 41:54.033
You either go or you stay.

41:54.100 --> 41:57.033
Me brain is telling us to go,
but me heart is saying no.

41:57.100 --> 41:59.433
Listen to Sam, Chloe, listen to
Sam.

42:09.467 --> 42:12.300
I don't know how I've turned
this around so quickly

42:12.367 --> 42:13.700
but we're necking on.

42:28.500 --> 42:30.467
Tonight has been awful

42:30.533 --> 42:34.867
and I've never felt so
misunderstood
and alone, so I'm going to bed.

42:35.733 --> 42:39.567
I can't believe I was close
to walking out on Sam. What a
twat.

42:43.333 --> 42:45.633
Make-up sex is always the best.

42:45.700 --> 42:49.633
You get all your frustration
and anger out, so pump me, baby!

42:54.567 --> 42:57.700
Shit. This is even more awkward
than I thought.

42:57.767 --> 42:59.633
(cheering)

42:59.700 --> 43:04.533
Now that Joel's here, he can
help
relieve some of my sexual
tension.

43:04.600 --> 43:08.200
I can feel all the negative
energy
of my ex-boyfriends

43:08.267 --> 43:10.100
oozing out of us like a shit.

43:10.167 --> 43:12.333
It's a dance move, the ball pop.

43:13.933 --> 43:15.300
Oh, my God!

43:17.133 --> 43:18.500
(cheering)
Aaron!

43:20.833 --> 43:22.633
I am so fucking angry!

43:24.333 --> 43:26.133
Come here, come here, stop it.

43:26.200 --> 43:28.100
This is fucked now.

43:53.400 --> 43:53.600
.
