to run it by me later?

10:57.490 --> 10:58.908
Brandon, you're great.

10:58.991 --> 11:00.701
I love you.

11:00.785 --> 11:03.746
The best.

11:03.829 --> 11:06.123
("Louie Louie" playing)

11:06.207 --> 11:07.750
Donna, wake up your boyfriend

11:07.833 --> 11:10.211
{\an1}and tell him to put on
No! Shh!ing shoes!

11:10.294 --> 11:11.253
{\an1}With all the studying
and rehearsing

11:11.337 --> 11:13.255
for the Senior Breakfast,
he's completely drained.

11:13.339 --> 11:16.092
He's missing the Last Day of
the Peach Pit Party right here!

11:16.175 --> 11:17.927
{\an4}NAT:
Last day at
the Peach Pit?

11:18.010 --> 11:20.221
Last day of high school.

11:20.304 --> 11:22.598
{\an3}It's the last day
of high school.

11:22.681 --> 11:24.850
{\an3}Nat, don't worry, because
we're not gonna abandon you

11:24.934 --> 11:26.310
{\an3}just because
we're graduating!

11:26.394 --> 11:29.146
(whooping, shouting)

11:29.230 --> 11:31.816
GrBig boy! Big boy!s!

11:31.899 --> 11:33.609
Where's Andrea?

11:33.692 --> 11:36.278
{\an1}Ah, she had some last-minute
worries to take care of.

11:36.362 --> 11:37.947
So, how are
the Senior Wills looking?

11:38.030 --> 11:38.948
Outstanding.

11:39.031 --> 11:40.658
Did you bring us
our advance copy?

11:40.741 --> 11:42.076
{\an1}Negative, young Kelly,
you're gonna have to wait

11:42.159 --> 11:43.661
{\an1}to get yours
at the Senior Breakfast

11:43.744 --> 11:45.079
just like everyone else.

11:45.162 --> 11:47.456
How come I don't get to leave
anything in the Senior Will?

11:47.540 --> 11:49.834
Yeah, and Nat ought to be an
honorary member of the class.

11:49.917 --> 11:52.461
Okay, Mr. Bussichio, what
would you like to leave?

11:52.545 --> 11:55.297
{\an3}Well, I know what I'd like
to leave your father.

11:55.381 --> 11:56.799
{\an3}(laughs):
That karaoke machine

11:56.882 --> 11:57.925
{\an3}that almost put me
out of business.

11:58.008 --> 11:59.760
{\an3}So, Nat, what would
you leave me?

11:59.844 --> 12:03.139
Uh... that singing group that
came in here to serenade you.

12:03.222 --> 12:03.806
Color Me Badd.

12:03.889 --> 12:04.807
What about me, Nat?

12:04.890 --> 12:07.768
Oh, that one's easy...

12:07.852 --> 12:08.936
Laverne.

12:10.104 --> 12:11.772
Wait, who's Laverne?

12:11.856 --> 12:14.817
{\an4}STEVE:
She's that crazy chick
who used to work for Nat.

12:14.900 --> 12:16.986
(East Coast accent):
Sir! Welcome!

12:17.069 --> 12:20.406
{\an3}I'm Laverne.
Charmed, I'm sure.

12:20.489 --> 12:21.282
{\an3}NAT:
I don't get it.

12:21.365 --> 12:23.826
Hey, don't you
What worry, pops.ween?

12:23.909 --> 12:25.828
{\an3}You'll get no trick-or-treats
with <i> this</i> little lady.

12:25.911 --> 12:28.414
I'm strictly a class act.

12:28.497 --> 12:32.793
A 100% U.S.-certified
hostess with the mostess.

12:32.877 --> 12:34.545
{\an3}The special plate for
today is spaghetti.

12:34.628 --> 12:37.465
It has meatballs on it,
with a red sauce--

12:37.548 --> 12:39.175
um, I think it's tomato.

12:39.258 --> 12:41.385
{\an3}And the soup is vegetable
with beefy beef.

12:41.469 --> 12:43.053
Very tasty with saltines.

12:43.137 --> 12:44.638
{\an3}And for dessert,
we have pie.

12:44.722 --> 12:47.391
We have peach pie, cherry pie,
apple pie, pecan pie,

12:47.475 --> 12:49.685
lemon pie, cream pie
and honey pie.

12:49.768 --> 12:50.394
{\an3}But if you want
pizza pie,

12:50.478 --> 12:52.146
you gotta go across the street.

12:52.229 --> 12:53.689
Ask for Guido--
he'll take care of ya.

12:53.772 --> 12:54.690
So what will it be?

12:54.774 --> 12:57.109
{\an1}Maybe we could get Laverne
to make an appearance

12:57.193 --> 13:00.738
Oh, I don't know,
aif you're nice to her..

13:00.821 --> 13:02.364
{\an1}BRANDON:
Hey, Jordan!

13:02.448 --> 13:04.033
Mr. Grad-u-ate.

13:04.116 --> 13:05.367
Congratulations.

13:05.451 --> 13:05.993
Andrea told me your
valedictorian speech

13:06.076 --> 13:08.787
was vThanks.quent.

13:08.871 --> 13:10.748
{\an3}But I think
she's exaggerating.

13:10.831 --> 13:12.082
Is she around?

13:12.166 --> 13:14.418
No, she said she had some stuff
she has to take care of.

13:14.502 --> 13:17.046
{\an3}I guess she forgot
I was coming.

13:17.129 --> 13:20.174
Well, tell her I stopped by
and wishI will.od luck.

13:20.257 --> 13:21.717
Hey, Jordan,

13:21.800 --> 13:23.886
um... do me a favor.

13:23.969 --> 13:26.096
{\an1}When you guys go back
to New Haven,

13:26.180 --> 13:28.349
{\an1}don't let Andrea
drive herself too crazy.

13:28.432 --> 13:31.560
{\an3}I won't, if she
ends up going there.

13:31.644 --> 13:33.145
What are you talking about?
She's been dreaming

13:33.229 --> 13:34.855
about going to Yale
since she was born.

13:34.939 --> 13:36.190
She didn't tell you?

13:36.273 --> 13:38.567
She's having a lot of
second thoughts about going.

13:39.652 --> 13:40.903
Well, maybe she did
mention something.

13:40.986 --> 13:44.365
Did it ever occur to you

13:44.448 --> 13:46.909
why she's having
second thoughts?

13:58.671 --> 14:00.714
(crickets chirping)

14:01.215 --> 14:05.219
(Brenda laughs)

14:05.302 --> 14:06.929
(laughs):
Hi, guys.

14:07.012 --> 14:08.055
What's wrong?

14:08.138 --> 14:11.433
{\an1}You got an envelope
from the admissions office

14:11.517 --> 14:12.935
{\an1}of the University
of Minnesota.

14:13.018 --> 14:15.104
Thick or thin?

14:15.187 --> 14:17.773
{\an3}Very thick.

14:17.856 --> 14:20.192
{\an3}Looks like we've
been admitted.

14:25.864 --> 14:27.825
Ew.

14:27.908 --> 14:29.743
What do you want me
to do with these?

14:29.827 --> 14:32.329
{\an1}Oh, God, relics
from the bimbo era.

14:32.413 --> 14:33.956
I'll take those
if you don't want them.

14:34.039 --> 14:35.124
You don't know
how much room you're going

14:35.207 --> 14:36.208
to have in the new place...
wherever that is.

14:36.292 --> 14:39.795
I was assuming you both
would be living in a dorm.

14:39.878 --> 14:41.463
Perish the thought.

14:41.547 --> 14:43.132
{\an3}I haven't even been
accepted anywhere yet.

14:43.215 --> 14:46.510
Well, I guess I'll put these
in the "maybe" pile.

14:47.219 --> 14:49.763
{\an1}God, talk
about change.

14:49.847 --> 14:52.182
New house, new school,
a new life.

14:52.266 --> 14:54.476
Hi, froggy.

14:54.560 --> 14:55.978
I know, it's like you work
so hard to get to the end

14:56.061 --> 14:58.188
of something, and all of a
sudden it starts all over again.

14:58.272 --> 15:01.650
Yeah, but not from square one.

15:01.734 --> 15:04.653
I mean,
you're actually cool now.

15:04.737 --> 15:06.822
Nothing compared
to what you used to be.

15:06.905 --> 15:09.033
Wait, are you saying
that I was once a geek?

15:09.116 --> 15:11.201
Well, I remember
what you were like

15:11.285 --> 15:14.455
when Mel and Jackie
started dating.

15:14.538 --> 15:15.831
Hey, Kel.

15:15.914 --> 15:17.166
Hi.

15:17.249 --> 15:19.418
I heard your mom and my dad

15:19.501 --> 15:20.961
had a pretty swinging time
last night.

15:21.045 --> 15:24.465
That's not what I heard.

15:24.548 --> 15:26.467
No, seriously.

15:26.550 --> 15:29.011
I think they already set up
another date for this week.

15:29.261 --> 15:31.388
Wouldn't it be cool

15:31.472 --> 15:33.015
if we ended up
step-brother and step-sister?

15:33.098 --> 15:36.185
(eerie music playing)

15:36.268 --> 15:39.146
(shower running)

15:39.229 --> 15:41.231
(water stops)

15:46.820 --> 15:48.864
David, get out of here!

15:48.947 --> 15:49.782
{\an1}Mom!

15:49.865 --> 15:51.742
I'm sorry, I didn't know
you were in here.

15:51.825 --> 15:53.911
Get out of here, now!

15:53.994 --> 15:55.162
I-I'm sorry...

15:57.122 --> 15:58.999
Oh, my God.

15:59.083 --> 16:00.751
(groans)

16:03.921 --> 16:07.675
Okay, I've apologized for that
numerous times already.

16:07.758 --> 16:09.718
I know, I know.

16:09.802 --> 16:12.221
Living with you actually
turned out to be kind of fun.

16:14.264 --> 16:15.557
I just wish Mel and Jackie's

16:15.641 --> 16:16.975
marriage had worked out.

16:17.059 --> 16:19.353
Yeah, well, at least you got
a baby sister out of it.

16:19.436 --> 16:21.397
And a brother.

16:24.817 --> 16:26.735
Anybody want some more fudge?

16:26.819 --> 16:28.737
I think weNo. fine, Mom.

16:28.821 --> 16:30.239
{\an1}Okay, on the plus side
for Minnesota,

16:30.322 --> 16:32.241
{\an1}it has an exceptional
drama department,

16:32.324 --> 16:34.618
{\an1}you can take your
junior year abroad...

16:34.702 --> 16:36.704
{\an3}You can do that through
California University, too.

16:36.787 --> 16:37.913
Not in Paris.

16:37.996 --> 16:39.748
You've already
been to Paris.

16:39.832 --> 16:40.791
Brandon, what is it with you?

16:40.874 --> 16:45.254
{\an3}Look, I understand why
you applied to Minnesota,

16:45.337 --> 16:48.590
{\an3}but seeing as everyone's
getting along so well now,

16:48.674 --> 16:51.427
{\an3}California University is
rated as a much better school.

16:51.510 --> 16:53.762
{\an3}Not to mention the fact--
Dad, you'll appreciate this--

16:53.846 --> 16:55.097
it's also a much
cheaper school.

16:55.180 --> 16:57.725
{\an6}BRENDA:
Brandon, just
because I got in,

16:57.808 --> 16:59.351
doesn't mean
I have to go.

16:59.435 --> 17:00.978
{\an3}Fine, then I guess
it's settled.

17:01.061 --> 17:03.439
{\an1}Well, I don't think we should
be too hasty about this.

17:03.522 --> 17:05.273
I'd like to keep
my options open.

17:05.357 --> 17:07.818
{\an4}JIM:
Well, another plus for
California University,

17:07.901 --> 17:09.278
aside from being a great school.

17:09.361 --> 17:10.654
Thank you.

17:10.738 --> 17:11.113
All your friends are here.

17:11.195 --> 17:13.198
And we're here.

17:15.826 --> 17:18.119
{\an1}I don't have to make
my decision right now, do I?

17:18.203 --> 17:19.454
(Brandon chuckles,
doorbell rings)

17:19.538 --> 17:21.080
I'll get it.

17:21.165 --> 17:22.290
Sorry, Mom.

17:22.374 --> 17:25.669
Listen, Brenda,

17:25.752 --> 17:28.088
this going away to school, um...

17:28.172 --> 17:30.424
it doesn't have anything
to do with Dylan, does it?

17:30.507 --> 17:32.468
Mom, this is the '90s.

17:32.551 --> 17:34.470
What kind of insecure
wuss chooses a college

17:34.553 --> 17:36.346
{\an1}based on where
some guy is going?

17:36.430 --> 17:38.015
Hi!

17:39.016 --> 17:40.309
What are you eating?

17:41.685 --> 17:44.354
"And so, as we travel
the unfathomable paths

17:44.438 --> 17:46.023
{\an1}"which weave before us,
we do so with the clarity

17:46.106 --> 17:47.816
of our vision and the certainty
of our stride..."

17:47.900 --> 17:49.443
Wait, do you think
that that should be

17:49.526 --> 17:51.111
{\an1}the "strength
of our convictions"

17:51.195 --> 17:52.321
{\an1}or the "strength
of our certainty"?

17:52.404 --> 17:55.491
{\an3}I'm still back on
"the unfathomable path."

17:55.574 --> 17:57.159
It's the worst, isn't it?

17:57.242 --> 17:59.286
{\an3}No, no, no,
it's not the worst.

17:59.369 --> 18:03.332
It just seems like you're
trying to conform to some image

18:03.415 --> 18:04.333
of what you think you
should be saying

18:04.416 --> 18:07.336
instead of deciding what
it is you want to say.

18:07.419 --> 18:08.962
You're right.

18:09.046 --> 18:11.006
You are absolutely right,
but what am I supposed to do?

18:11.089 --> 18:12.800
If I throw this out,
I will have to do

18:12.883 --> 18:14.009
a page one rewrite by tomorrow.

18:14.092 --> 18:15.803
I can't do that,
I will be a basket case.

18:15.886 --> 18:17.304
I don't even know
what I would write about.

18:17.387 --> 18:18.347
I mean, how do I know that

18:18.430 --> 18:21.099
that speech would be any better
than this speech?

18:21.183 --> 18:22.017
You know what?

18:22.100 --> 18:24.228
I may as well tell them
I have laryngitis

18:24.311 --> 18:26.313
because at this point,
Brandon, it would not be so far

18:26.396 --> 18:28.690
from the truth, my throat
is killing me, I don't even...

18:28.774 --> 18:30.526
Andrea, get a grip
on yourself, would ya?

18:30.609 --> 18:32.319
Look at yourself, relax.

18:32.402 --> 18:33.612
You're having a panic attack.

18:33.695 --> 18:37.241
{\an1}The speech
is not that bad.

18:37.324 --> 18:40.160
It just needs
a little fine-tuning.

18:40.244 --> 18:42.162
In fact, I'll help you with it

18:42.246 --> 18:44.039
for as long as it takes, okay?

18:47.292 --> 18:50.671
{\an3}Brandon...
how am I going to get

18:50.754 --> 18:52.172
through college without you?

18:52.256 --> 18:55.300
I'm sure you'll manage.

18:56.760 --> 18:59.680
{\an3}You know, the day you
walked into that newsroom,

18:59.763 --> 19:02.724
{\an3}I knew...<i> knew</i> that
you were special.

19:02.808 --> 19:05.227
{\an1}You thought I was tripe
the first time you met me.

19:05.310 --> 19:06.395
Yeah.

19:06.478 --> 19:08.397
But that all changed
after you followed me home

19:08.480 --> 19:11.233
to my parents'
house in Van Nuys.

19:11.316 --> 19:14.403
That is the day that I knew
that I could trust you.

19:14.486 --> 19:16.363
And so began
a beautiful friendship.

19:16.446 --> 19:20.409
Well, it hasn't been
<i>just</i> a friendship, has it?

19:20.492 --> 19:23.245
I guess you could say
our relationship's

19:23.328 --> 19:24.329
had its ups and downs.

19:26.498 --> 19:28.083
{\an1}So what's the big
surprise, huh?

19:28.166 --> 19:31.920
Well, I've, uh...

19:32.004 --> 19:34.631
I've got a going away
present for you.

19:34.715 --> 19:36.341
Well, what is it?

19:38.343 --> 19:42.139
Uh, well, um...

19:42.222 --> 19:44.433
(giggles):
Ta-da...

19:44.516 --> 19:48.228
What?

19:48.312 --> 19:50.105
The carousel, the horse, what?

19:50.188 --> 19:52.316
No, I'm....

19:52.399 --> 19:55.444
I'm giving you
the person on my horse.

19:55.527 --> 19:59.072
Uh, if you'll take her.

19:59.156 --> 20:02.284
What?

20:04.328 --> 20:09.207
Look, Brandon, we may never
see each other again and I...

20:09.291 --> 20:11.418
I want good-bye to be
a moment we both remember.

20:20.093 --> 20:21.136
{\an3}Oh, my God!

20:21.219 --> 20:23.472
{\an3}I know exactly why this
speech isn't working.

20:23.555 --> 20:24.765
Why?

20:24.848 --> 20:26.767
Because it's not
coming from the heart.

20:26.850 --> 20:28.143
It is exactly like you said.

20:28.226 --> 20:31.104
I am trying to live up
to this image of being a Yalie,

20:31.188 --> 20:32.356
when I know deep inside
I should probably

20:32.439 --> 20:35.150
just stay in town and go
to California University.

20:35.233 --> 20:37.611
Andrea, you've got
to go to Yale.

20:37.694 --> 20:39.363
You can't give that up
because of me, I'm not worth it.

20:39.446 --> 20:42.324
It's true that we challenge

20:42.407 --> 20:44.785
and support each other and all
that, it's very true.

20:44.868 --> 20:46.787
{\an3}But we just don't have
the kind of relationship

20:46.870 --> 20:47.537
that you should give up
your life's dream for.

20:47.621 --> 20:49.498
Just hold it, okay, Brandon.

20:49.581 --> 20:53.043
You are starting
to sound like me.

20:55.128 --> 20:57.381
{\an1}Yes.?

20:57.464 --> 20:59.049
If I don't go
to school back East,

20:59.132 --> 21:02.344
it's because I don't want to be
in hock for the rest of my life.

21:02.427 --> 21:04.137
I mean, do you know how
expensive Yale is?

21:04.221 --> 21:08.016
I think I have
a pretty good idea.

21:10.310 --> 21:12.854
Sorry I jumped to conclusions.

21:12.938 --> 21:16.191
It's okay.

21:20.487 --> 21:23.198
(knocking)

21:24.491 --> 21:25.993
{\an1}Hi, Smush.

21:26.451 --> 21:29.621
{\an1}Kel, if you tell anybody
that I let you call me that

21:29.705 --> 21:30.539
(TV playing)u.

21:30.622 --> 21:31.540
Well, my lips are sealed.

21:31.623 --> 21:34.501
{\an1}That's the way
I like them.

21:34.584 --> 21:35.877
What are you watching?

21:35.961 --> 21:37.546
Oh, I'm not really watching.

21:37.629 --> 21:40.590
I was just sort of reading
about California University.

21:40.674 --> 21:43.385
Yeah.eally?

21:43.468 --> 21:44.845
I think we'd have
a good time here.

21:44.928 --> 21:46.096
You think so, huh?

21:46.179 --> 21:48.015
{\an3}Well, my dad was real
high on the idea

21:48.098 --> 21:49.599
{\an3}of me going
to college, so...

21:49.683 --> 21:52.394
{\an3}I don't know, I figure
I'll check it out

21:52.477 --> 21:53.729
for a little while.

21:53.812 --> 21:56.023
{\an1}I suppose, but the thought
of going back to school

21:56.106 --> 21:57.607
{\an1}for four more years
is just overwhelming.

21:57.691 --> 22:02.112
{\an3}Well, at least we'll be
overwhelmed together.

22:02.195 --> 22:04.906
{\an1}You've used that
line on me before.

22:04.990 --> 22:06.867
Yes, you have.

22:06.950 --> 22:08.118
When?

22:08.201 --> 22:09.703
The night in the pool.

22:12.497 --> 22:13.790
{\an3}KELLY:
This was a good idea.

22:13.874 --> 22:15.667
I'm full of good ideas.

22:18.253 --> 22:20.255
(Kelly laughs)

22:32.184 --> 22:33.560
{\an1}Don't do that
if you don't mean it.

22:33.643 --> 22:35.562
I mean it.

22:35.645 --> 22:38.482
Well, you're in trouble now.

22:48.658 --> 22:50.577
{\an1}Dylan, what if Brenda
had come tonight?

22:50.660 --> 22:51.578
{\an3}(laughs)

22:51.661 --> 22:53.455
{\an3}She didn't.

22:53.538 --> 22:54.581
So is that how you
made up your mind?

22:54.664 --> 22:55.582
'Cause she's not here?

22:55.665 --> 22:58.919
Maybe.

23:00.545 --> 23:04.508
Mel and my mom are breaking up
because he was fooling around.

23:04.591 --> 23:07.469
I just can't feel that great
about being the other woman.

23:07.552 --> 23:10.472
{\an3}Look, it was you two who
gave me that dumb ultimatum.

23:10.555 --> 23:11.890
You said choose.

23:11.973 --> 23:14.643
I chose and I chose you.

23:14.726 --> 23:17.145
I want you.

23:17.229 --> 23:18.855
I've always wanted you.

23:19.856 --> 23:22.651
(doorbell ringing)

23:22.734 --> 23:25.153
{\an1}Why does this always
happen to us?

23:25.237 --> 23:27.322
{\an3}(sighing):
Don't move.

23:29.699 --> 23:31.618
Who is it?

23:31.701 --> 23:33.620
Dylan, it's me.

23:33.703 --> 23:34.579
It's my mother.

23:34.663 --> 23:36.957
(huffs)

23:37.040 --> 23:39.376
Unbelievable.

23:41.294 --> 23:42.629
Hi!

23:42.712 --> 23:44.923
(sighs)

23:45.006 --> 23:45.924
What a pleasant surprise.

23:46.007 --> 23:49.177
{\an3}Did you really think I'd
miss your graduation?

23:49.261 --> 23:50.637
You missed practically
everything else in my life.

23:50.720 --> 23:54.349
Oh, you're in a snarly mood.

23:54.432 --> 23:56.184
{\an1}Aren't you the least bit
tickled to see me?

23:56.268 --> 23:57.227
I'm stunned actually.

23:57.310 --> 23:58.812
{\an3}Can't you pick up the
phone like a normal person

23:58.895 --> 24:00.355
{\an3}and call and let me
know that you're coming?

24:00.438 --> 24:01.690
Because I was afraid
you'd tell me to stay home

24:01.773 --> 24:05.569
and I was hoping we could
spend a few days together.

24:05.652 --> 24:07.571
Besides, half the fun
is catching you

24:07.654 --> 24:09.156
with a girl in the bedroom.

24:09.239 --> 24:10.615
{\an1}Did I, did I catch you
with a girl in the bedroom?

24:10.699 --> 24:13.076
No, no, you didn't,
we were on the couch.

24:13.160 --> 24:14.077
Kelly!

24:14.161 --> 24:15.704
You're still with Kelly?

24:15.787 --> 24:17.080
You know, you barge in here,

24:17.164 --> 24:18.915
{\an3}you expect me to welcome
you with open arms

24:18.999 --> 24:19.875
{\an3}when the fact
of the matter is

24:19.958 --> 24:21.710
{\an3}when I needed you,
you were unreachable.

24:21.793 --> 24:22.711
I was on a trek in the Andes.

24:22.794 --> 24:25.213
{\an3}Oh, yeah, I was just
at my father's funeral.

24:25.297 --> 24:27.757
{\an3}And I called you
as soon as I Right.

24:27.841 --> 24:29.718
What'd you expect? It was
bad timing, you and I, huh?

24:29.801 --> 24:30.594
(clears throat)

24:30.677 --> 24:33.013
Hi, Kelly.

24:33.096 --> 24:35.390
I would love to stop and chat,
but apparently this visit

24:35.473 --> 24:36.975
is going to be shorter
than I thought.

24:37.058 --> 24:37.934
What's it going to be?

24:38.018 --> 24:39.394
The Hilton or the Bel Age?

24:39.477 --> 24:40.562
That wilIt's on me.cessary.

24:40.645 --> 24:44.065
So I see I've outlived
my usefulness

24:44.149 --> 24:45.775
now you're
a full-fledged millionaire.

24:45.859 --> 24:46.735
{\an3}DYLAN:
Yeah, reservations, please.

24:46.818 --> 24:48.737
Did he rush right out
and get a Gold Card?

24:48.820 --> 24:50.530
Hi, this is
Dylan McKay.

24:50.614 --> 24:51.531
{\an3}I need your

24:57.454 --> 24:58.914
No, don't apologize, dear.

25:24.064 --> 25:24.648
{\an1}Your speech is
already a hundred times

25:24.731 --> 25:25.774
better than it was.

25:25.857 --> 25:28.693
{\an3}Well, since I started off
in the negative column,

25:28.777 --> 25:29.778
{\an3}that just puts me back
to zero, doesn't it?

One, one sec.

29:10.123 --> 29:12.625
This, please.

29:12.709 --> 29:13.710
<i>S'il vous plaî.</i>

29:13.793 --> 29:15.128
{\an1}<i>Cervelle de veau,</i>
<i>très bien.</i>

29:15.211 --> 29:16.129
What's that?

29:16.212 --> 29:16.838
<i>Veau</i> is veal.

29:16.921 --> 29:18.756
Ooh, that sounds good.

29:18.840 --> 29:19.174
Garcon, make that two.

29:19.257 --> 29:21.759
<i>Très bien.</i>

29:22.844 --> 29:25.305
{\an1}You see, that wasn't
so hard, was it?

29:25.388 --> 29:26.306
Bon appétit.

29:26.389 --> 29:27.849
Bon appétit.

29:27.932 --> 29:30.810
<i>Cervelle de veau.</i>

29:33.938 --> 29:35.356
(scoffs)

29:35.440 --> 29:37.859
Wait a second.

29:37.942 --> 29:39.527
I ordered veal.

29:39.611 --> 29:41.863
<i>Me oui, cervelle de veau.</i>

29:41.946 --> 29:43.531
Bon appétit.

29:43.615 --> 29:47.494
Okay, it looks weird,
but I'm sure it's edible.

29:47.577 --> 29:48.703
You're right.

29:48.786 --> 29:50.121
About now I could eat
just about anything.

30:01.257 --> 30:04.761
It's very, uh... French.

30:04.844 --> 30:08.014
It's, uh, it's kind of mushy.

30:17.315 --> 30:19.192
It's brains.

30:19.275 --> 30:22.278
(group laughing)

30:26.783 --> 30:29.536
{\an3}How could
you do that?

30:29.619 --> 30:30.787
Donna, Donna, we're on soon.

30:30.870 --> 30:32.247
We've still got
to get into costume.

30:32.330 --> 30:33.248
Okay, let's go.

30:33.331 --> 30:34.415
Break a leg.

30:34.499 --> 30:36.751
{\an6}BRANDON:
How could you
order veal anyway?

30:36.834 --> 30:38.086
{\an3}STEVE:
I like veal, I like veal.

30:38.169 --> 30:40.088
(all talking)

30:40.171 --> 30:41.714
{\an3}Au revoir,
Mademoiselle Donna.

30:41.798 --> 30:42.715
Have fun.

30:42.799 --> 30:44.425
{\an3}<i>Me ou.</i>

30:44.509 --> 30:47.428
{\an3}That's a pretty funny
bit with the cow brains.

30:47.512 --> 30:49.764
{\an3}(chuckles)

30:49.847 --> 30:52.058
What's the matter?

30:52.141 --> 30:53.434
{\an1}I really loved being
in Paris,

30:53.518 --> 30:55.103
{\an1}but I can't help wondering
what would be

30:55.186 --> 30:58.273
if I hadn't gone.

31:04.737 --> 31:07.198
Does anybody else know you've
been accepted to Minnesota?

31:13.538 --> 31:14.914
Okay.

31:14.998 --> 31:15.873
Get this.

31:15.957 --> 31:17.792
{\an1}Some people would rather live
in Beverly Hills

31:17.875 --> 31:19.127
{\an1}than here
in Aurora, Illinois.

31:19.210 --> 31:20.378
{\an3}No way.

31:20.461 --> 31:22.130
And they actually say
that it's kind of cool

31:22.213 --> 31:23.131
{\an1}to go
to West Beverly High.

31:23.214 --> 31:25.508
{\an3}No Way.

31:25.592 --> 31:27.427
{\an3}No Way!

31:27.510 --> 31:29.637
{\an1}And these same people
also say...

31:29.721 --> 31:33.516
{\an5}BOTH:
Live from West Beverly High,
it's the Senior Breakfast!

31:33.600 --> 31:35.310
(crowd cheering)

31:41.524 --> 31:44.527
{\an6}STEVE:
It's the Senior
Breakfast with...

31:44.611 --> 31:47.655
David Silver, Donna Martin,

31:47.739 --> 31:50.491
Mrs. T. and the class of '93,

31:50.575 --> 31:51.826
special musical guest

31:51.909 --> 31:53.661
the Wildcat Singers.

31:53.745 --> 31:55.163
{\an3}And here he
is now...

31:55.246 --> 31:59.626
David Silver!

32:00.627 --> 32:02.795
Thank you, thank you.

32:02.879 --> 32:03.796
Thank you, Steve.

32:03.880 --> 32:05.590
Could you please come up here
for a minute?

32:05.673 --> 32:08.509
{\an1}Come on.

32:08.593 --> 32:10.553
{\an1}Now, somebody found
something

32:10.637 --> 32:12.138
and they, they thought
it might belong to you.

32:12.221 --> 32:14.849
Oh, yep, it's a legacy key.

32:14.932 --> 32:16.684
{\an1}They say it unlocks
every door

32:16.768 --> 32:18.519
{\an1}to every boys' bathroom
in the entire school.

32:18.603 --> 32:19.437
(crowd cheering)

32:21.272 --> 32:24.567
{\an3}Aren't you late for
detention, Steve?

32:25.777 --> 32:27.695
Let's hear it for Steve.

32:27.779 --> 32:29.906
(crowd cheering)

32:29.989 --> 32:32.992
And let's hear it for my partner
in crime Donna Martin.

32:34.619 --> 32:36.037
Whoo, whoo, whoo!

32:36.120 --> 32:37.580
Whoo!

32:38.164 --> 32:41.584
{\an1}Okay, now, I know most
of you have seen

32:41.668 --> 32:43.086
David's video yearbook,

32:43.169 --> 32:45.588
{\an1}but we thought you'd like
to see some of the outtakes

32:45.672 --> 32:47.215
{\an1}that didn't make it
on the reel,

32:47.298 --> 32:48.383
{\an1}starting
with the camping trip

32:48.466 --> 32:50.385
{\an1}that some of us
will never forget.

32:50.468 --> 32:52.220
He's not going
to show that.

32:52.303 --> 32:56.057
{\an5}DAVID:
It's a brand new morning
here at Hukamuk Lodge

32:56.140 --> 32:57.725
and as you can see,

32:57.809 --> 32:59.686
some campers tend
to be less bright-eyed

32:59.769 --> 33:02.397
and bushy-tailed than others.

33:02.480 --> 33:05.024
We've heard tell of some wild
boar living in these parts.

33:05.108 --> 33:07.985
STEVE:
Give me a break, okay?

33:08.069 --> 33:10.279
Oh, isn't it a little early
for this, David?

33:11.823 --> 33:12.281
David, get out!

33:12.365 --> 33:14.242
(Steve blowing nose)

33:14.325 --> 33:17.620
BRENDA (on video):
Steve, what are you doing?

33:17.704 --> 33:19.414
STEVE:
Leave me alone.

33:19.497 --> 33:21.582
{\an5}KELLY:
He's clearing his sinuses
or so he claims.

33:21.666 --> 33:22.875
STEVE:
It's true.

33:22.959 --> 33:24.752
BRENDA:
I am starving...

33:26.713 --> 33:28.631
{\an3}Man, this
is beautiful.

33:31.843 --> 33:33.261
{\an3}Brandon!

33:33.344 --> 33:34.220
Oh!

33:34.303 --> 33:36.222
{\an3}Brandon!

33:37.390 --> 33:39.600
Where are you at, man?

33:39.684 --> 33:41.811
(sBrandon!)

33:41.894 --> 33:44.522
Dylan, get back, man,
the ledge is going to go.

33:44.605 --> 33:46.232
All right, man, grab my hand.

33:46.315 --> 33:48.985
I-I can't, man, I can't let go.

33:49.068 --> 33:50.486
You gotta try.

33:51.320 --> 33:53.781
Come on.

33:54.741 --> 33:56.242
(grunts)

33:56.325 --> 33:57.118
Don't look down.

33:57.201 --> 33:59.120
Look up here.

33:59.203 --> 34:00.371
Look right here.

34:10.380 --> 34:12.091
All right, come on.

34:12.175 --> 34:13.259
(both grunting)

34:21.893 --> 34:22.768
(applause)

34:22.851 --> 34:24.812
{\an3}And for being so graceful
on the gridiron,

34:24.896 --> 34:27.190
your trophies.

34:27.273 --> 34:29.942
{\an3}Let's give it up for
the varsity backfield.

34:30.025 --> 34:31.944
{\an1}You're dead,
Silver.

34:32.027 --> 34:34.655
Thank you, Tony.

34:34.739 --> 34:38.159
And now, Brenda Walsh
and Kelly Taylor, come on down.

34:38.242 --> 34:40.661
Hey, now.

34:40.745 --> 34:42.955
Here goes nothing.

34:52.590 --> 34:54.509
Now, you guys don't know this,

34:54.592 --> 34:57.136
but Brenda and Kelly are the
only students at West Beverly

34:57.220 --> 34:59.889
to ever win a prize
on a radio call-in show

34:59.972 --> 35:01.974
and I don't think either
of them will ever forget

35:02.058 --> 35:02.809
{\an1}the prize
that they won.

35:02.892 --> 35:06.854
{\an3}Okay, everybody,
watch the monitors.

35:07.814 --> 35:08.981
I don't know, Kel.

35:09.065 --> 35:11.526
This might have to be
a solo mission on your part.

35:11.609 --> 35:12.360
{\an5}KELLY:
Brenda, I couldn't do that
to you.

35:12.443 --> 35:14.237
You're my best friend.

35:15.446 --> 35:16.989
{\an3}I have to help you
face your fears.

35:17.073 --> 35:17.990
No, Kelly!

35:18.074 --> 35:22.078
(both screaming)

35:29.126 --> 35:31.712
This is so amazing!

35:31.796 --> 35:32.755
Brenda, get me down!

35:32.839 --> 35:34.257
(both screaming)

35:37.260 --> 35:39.387
(cheering and applause)

35:44.809 --> 35:47.270
{\an3}Here's a little memento
of that experience

35:47.353 --> 35:48.271
for both of you.

35:48.354 --> 35:50.857
{\an3}Thanks.

35:50.940 --> 35:52.191
But don't go yet

35:52.275 --> 35:54.360
{\an3}because I want you guys and
Donna to turn the clocks back

35:54.443 --> 35:56.696

35:56.779 --> 35:58.489

Brenda and Kelly were up

39:13.851 --> 39:14.935
{\an3}all night writing and
choreographing that one.

39:15.019 --> 39:15.978
Good job, guys.

39:16.062 --> 39:17.772
{\an1}I just want you to know
that was not my idea.

39:17.855 --> 39:19.231
Hey, I'm not complaining.

39:19.315 --> 39:20.941
You guys want to get up there

39:21.025 --> 39:21.984
be my guest.

39:22.068 --> 39:23.110
{\an3}Thanks for
being here.

39:23.194 --> 39:24.779
It's been a great year
and, uh...

39:24.862 --> 39:26.155
Not so fast, Davey.

39:26.238 --> 39:29.909
{\an3}What retrospective would be
complete without an award

39:29.992 --> 39:32.995

39:33.079 --> 39:33.996

the spring dance.

39:51.055 --> 39:52.973
Yeah, the pre-Donna era.

39:53.057 --> 39:54.308
You guys, this is great.

39:54.391 --> 39:55.684
I missed most of it
because I came late that night.

39:55.768 --> 39:58.687
Yeah.

39:58.771 --> 40:01.023
I missed most of it, too.

40:06.070 --> 40:07.154
Dylan, this is so beautiful.

40:07.238 --> 40:08.155
Do you know

40:08.239 --> 40:10.866
why I'm so lucky?

40:12.076 --> 40:13.994
Why?

40:14.078 --> 40:16.080
{\an3}How many girls get to have
sex for the first time

40:16.163 --> 40:17.832
with someone they love?

40:17.915 --> 40:19.166
I don't know.

40:19.250 --> 40:21.669
{\an1}I've never really taken
an opinion poll.

40:21.752 --> 40:23.754
Mm.

40:26.340 --> 40:28.342
{\an3}DWhoo!

40:28.425 --> 40:29.343
Dylan, stop!

40:29.426 --> 40:31.846
Put me down!

40:31.929 --> 40:32.680
{\an3}I'm sorry.

40:32.763 --> 40:34.473
{\an1}I just can't
control myself.

40:34.557 --> 40:35.558
{\an3}Well, don't
fight it.

40:35.808 --> 40:38.811
We are in the room.

40:38.894 --> 40:40.980
We certainly are.

40:45.109 --> 40:48.821
(music playing)

40:48.904 --> 40:49.738
(crowd cheering)

41:06.964 --> 41:10.050
Th-th-th-that's all, folks!

41:26.859 --> 41:28.861
{\an1}You got
a standing ovation.

41:28.944 --> 41:31.530
{\an1}Doesn't that count
for something?

41:31.614 --> 41:34.033
{\an3}I just feel kind of
burned out, that's all.

41:34.116 --> 41:35.409
Well, of course you do.

41:35.492 --> 41:36.577
I mean, anybody would

41:36.660 --> 41:39.205
{\an1}with the schedule you've
been carrying all this year.

41:40.164 --> 41:42.041
But it's over now.

41:42.124 --> 41:43.542
(sighs)

41:43.626 --> 41:44.084
Yeah, it's over.

41:44.168 --> 41:45.753
Now I can't figure out

41:45.836 --> 41:48.422
{\an3}why I've been pushing
myself so hard

41:48.505 --> 41:49.423
{\an3}when I could
have just stayed

41:49.506 --> 41:51.926
{\an3}and been king of the
mountain for another year.

41:54.011 --> 41:57.514
{\an1}David, you wanted
to be with your friends.

41:57.598 --> 41:59.600
I didn't want to be
left behind, but...

41:59.683 --> 42:03.938
{\an3}it's like everyone knows what
they're gonna do except me.

42:06.732 --> 42:10.444
{\an3}I don't know. I just feel
like the gang's breaking up.

42:13.739 --> 42:18.160
Well, you still have me.

42:18.244 --> 42:20.287
♪ ♪

42:30.089 --> 42:31.799
{\an5}KELLY:
<i>Steve, this project</i>
<i>was a great idea.</i>

42:31.882 --> 42:32.883
STEVE:
<i>Thank you.</i>

42:33.884 --> 42:35.844
Steve, Steve,
Steve, Steve, Steve,

42:35.928 --> 42:38.013
try not go get your pawprints
on everything.

42:38.097 --> 42:38.681
Oh, like you're one
to talk, huh?

42:38.764 --> 42:41.350
{\an1}You guys,
this is so classy.

42:41.433 --> 42:42.476
DONNA:
Yeah, it's getting there.

42:42.559 --> 42:44.478
{\an1}Yeah, well, it would have gone
a lot quicker

42:44.561 --> 42:46.313
if Zuckerman and Silver
hadn't flaked out on us.

42:46.397 --> 42:47.815
{\an1}Excuse me,
David needed some sleep.

42:47.898 --> 42:50.693
Yeah, and Andrea seemed very
edgy at the senior breakfast.

42:50.776 --> 42:53.237
Yeah, I would be, too,
if I had to stand up

42:53.320 --> 42:54.989
in front of all those people
and give a speech like that.

42:55.072 --> 42:55.698
Actually, she's a lot
more stressed out

42:55.781 --> 42:57.992
about Yale than
anything else.

42:58.075 --> 42:59.702
Yeah?

42:59.785 --> 43:01.453
{\an1}The pressures
of the Ivy League?

43:01.537 --> 43:04.039
Actually, the pressures of
how to <i>pay </i> for the Ivy League.

43:04.123 --> 43:06.083
She's seriously
considering staying here.

43:06.166 --> 43:07.835
Man, that sucks. You know,
Yale is one of the best colleges

43:07.918 --> 43:08.877
in the country.
If they accepted her,

43:08.961 --> 43:10.004
she should go.

43:10.087 --> 43:13.674
Well, maybe you should give
her some financial aid.

43:13.757 --> 43:14.883
BRANDON:
Yeah, bro, you're going to be

43:14.967 --> 43:16.719
{\an1}a multimillionaire one day.
You know,

43:16.802 --> 43:19.054
come to think of it, I
could use some aid myself.

43:19.138 --> 43:20.055
So could I.

43:20.139 --> 43:20.681
Yeah, couldn't
we all?

43:20.764 --> 43:23.350
I'm sorry.

43:23.434 --> 43:25.352
I was... just kidding.

43:25.436 --> 43:28.439
We'll talk
about it later.

43:34.987 --> 43:37.656
{\an1}Oh, good,
you're home early.

43:37.740 --> 43:38.866
Well, it isn't
every day

43:38.949 --> 43:40.826
your kids graduate
from high school.

43:40.909 --> 43:42.536
Isn't that the truth?

43:42.619 --> 43:43.704
So where are
our scholars?

43:43.787 --> 43:46.540
{\an1}Oh, they're out back with
Dylan and Kelly and company.

43:46.623 --> 43:47.875
The gang's
all here.

43:47.958 --> 43:49.668
{\an1}And she asked us
not to say anything

43:49.752 --> 43:50.836
{\an1}about Minnesota
in front of them.

43:50.919 --> 43:52.880
Which means what?

43:52.963 --> 43:56.800
{\an1}I don't know... and
I don't think she does either.

43:58.052 --> 44:01.722
(sighs)

44:01.805 --> 44:05.392
They grow up so fast.

44:05.476 --> 44:07.686
Remember the first time
we left them home alone?

44:07.770 --> 44:08.896
(sighs)

44:08.979 --> 44:10.773
How could I forget?

44:10.856 --> 44:12.399
Ah...

44:12.483 --> 44:12.816
Oh, this is heaven.

44:16.987 --> 44:19.281
Honey, I see Trudy.

44:19.365 --> 44:20.741
{\an3}Over there.

44:20.824 --> 44:23.285
Quick, let's duck down.

44:23.369 --> 44:24.870
It's no use.
They're wearing robes.

44:24.953 --> 44:26.038
They're coming this way.

44:26.121 --> 44:29.625
Honey, we must be on
the same wavelength.

44:29.708 --> 44:30.793
We have been looking all over
for you lovebirds to see

44:30.876 --> 44:33.921
if you want to take a little
splish-splash with us,

44:34.004 --> 44:35.589
and here you are,

44:35.672 --> 44:37.758
right where we were
hoping you'd be.

44:37.841 --> 44:39.843
How are you tonight, Cindy?

44:39.927 --> 44:41.929
I'm fine, Bob.

44:42.012 --> 44:42.971
How are you?

44:43.055 --> 44:44.848
I'm game.

44:48.644 --> 44:50.771
Speaking of games,

44:50.854 --> 44:52.689
{\an1}we've got a tennis
game tomorrow...

44:52.773 --> 44:54.274
TRUDY:
Oh, come on now,

44:54.358 --> 44:57.611
Jimbo, I've been waiting
all weekend to go around

44:57.694 --> 45:00.948
the goosy-goosy,
ducky-ducky with you.

45:03.033 --> 45:04.952
What's she talking about?

45:05.035 --> 45:06.620
I don't know.

45:08.038 --> 45:12.042
But, honey, Trudy and Bob
aren't wearing bathing suits.

45:13.127 --> 45:15.838
Oh, my God.

45:15.921 --> 45:17.089
If that's them,

45:17.172 --> 45:18.632
I'm going straight
to the management.

45:18.715 --> 45:20.801
It's almost 2:00
in the morning, for God's sake.

45:20.884 --> 45:23.971
(ringing continues)

45:24.054 --> 45:25.806
Hello.

45:25.889 --> 45:26.890
Mom, it's me.

45:26.974 --> 45:30.769
Hi, Brenda.

45:30.853 --> 45:32.312
Sorry I called so late.

45:32.396 --> 45:33.522
What's wrong?

45:33.605 --> 45:36.692
Brandon was
in a car accident tonight,

45:36.775 --> 45:38.819
but he's okay.

45:38.902 --> 45:42.781
Brandon was in
a car accident.

45:42.865 --> 45:44.533
Brenda, what happened?

45:46.410 --> 45:48.328
He was driving alone.

45:48.412 --> 45:49.830
So I don't really know.

45:49.913 --> 45:51.665
But he's all right.

45:52.082 --> 45:54.960
Where's Brandon now, honey?

45:55.043 --> 45:56.962
He's in jail, Daddy.

46:00.174 --> 46:03.135
They arrested him
for drunk driving.

46:04.094 --> 46:06.096
I'm really sorry, Dad.

46:08.015 --> 46:10.350
That had to be the worst
night I ever spent.

46:10.434 --> 46:14.354
{\an1}Oh, and the next few days
afterwards were...

46:14.438 --> 46:16.815
so tense around here.

46:16.899 --> 46:18.942
That they were.

46:21.111 --> 46:23.572
Oh, hi.

46:25.115 --> 46:29.786
{\an1}I was getting into this novel
your mom recommended.

46:34.458 --> 46:39.546
Actually, I was hoping
we could talk.

46:41.507 --> 46:44.968
Yeah, me, too.

46:47.804 --> 46:51.975
'Cause... the other night

46:52.059 --> 46:54.811
wasn't exactly the first
time I had a drink.

46:57.147 --> 46:59.733
I figured as much.

46:59.817 --> 47:01.026
How'd you know?

47:01.109 --> 47:04.029
Believe it or not I
was your age once, too.

47:04.112 --> 47:07.866
And you lived to tell about it?

47:07.950 --> 47:09.993
So will you, Brandon.

47:22.089 --> 47:25.425
I've always been a sucker
for happy endings.

47:40.816 --> 47:42.776
Ozzie and Harriet alert,
left flank.

47:42.859 --> 47:43.819
Steve, that's our parents
you're talking about.

47:43.902 --> 47:45.946
{\an1}Besides, what does that
make us, David and Ricky?

47:46.029 --> 47:48.282
No, no, no, Mr. Walsh,
you can't look.

47:48.365 --> 47:49.449
It's a surprise.

47:49.533 --> 47:50.784
Forget about it, Dad.

47:50.867 --> 47:51.952
The backyard is off limits
until further notice.

47:52.035 --> 47:53.203
You're just gonna have to wait

47:53.287 --> 47:54.913
{\an1}with the rest of America
until we graduate.

47:54.997 --> 47:56.123
Them's da breaks, Jimbo.

47:57.708 --> 48:00.294
{\an1}You know, the first time I met
you, you were just as filthy

48:00.377 --> 48:01.795
Oh, yeah?e now.

48:01.878 --> 48:04.631
{\an1}Mm-hmm, only it was from
the grease from Brandon's car.

48:04.715 --> 48:06.383
Yeah, I asked you if
I could take a shower.

48:06.466 --> 48:08.468
And I said yes.

48:09.428 --> 48:10.178
(shower running)

48:10.262 --> 48:13.307
Brandon, can't you ever
shut the door?

48:13.390 --> 48:15.726
I mean, it's hot enough
in here already!

48:18.687 --> 48:20.314
Sorry.

48:20.397 --> 48:23.817
Uh, no, it's okay.

48:29.239 --> 48:32.159
You, uh, keep
popping up on me today.

48:32.242 --> 48:34.995
Yeah.

48:35.078 --> 48:39.499
So you were saying you're, uh...
into videotape, huh?

48:39.583 --> 48:42.294
Yeah, I like movies.

48:42.377 --> 48:44.713
{\an1}You ever see
<i>Animal Crackers?</i>

48:44.796 --> 48:46.506
You know, Marx Brothers?

48:46.590 --> 48:48.967
I think so, on TV.

48:49.051 --> 48:51.345
{\an1}Oh, it's so much better
on the big screen.

48:53.263 --> 48:54.056
{\an1}It's too bad
you're on duty tonight

48:54.139 --> 48:56.058
or you could see what I mean.

48:56.141 --> 49:00.520
Well, actually my
plans got poxed.

49:00.604 --> 49:03.482
You want to come along?

49:03.565 --> 49:05.567
Yeah.

49:10.447 --> 49:12.449
(phone ringing)

49:13.200 --> 49:15.327
{\an1}CINDY:
Hello.

49:15.410 --> 49:16.119
Iris!

49:16.203 --> 49:18.872
{\an1}Oh, it's so nice
to hear your voice.

49:18.955 --> 49:19.539
Iris...

49:19.623 --> 49:22.000
Tell her
I'm not here.

49:22.084 --> 49:23.085
Well, yes, he's right here.

49:23.168 --> 49:24.252
Um, just a minute.

49:24.336 --> 49:26.380
Oh, what now?

49:27.422 --> 49:29.716
It's for me?

49:29.800 --> 49:31.093
I'lThat's my cue.de.

49:31.176 --> 49:33.095
{\an1}Oh, no, you're not
bailing on us, McKay.

49:33.178 --> 49:35.555
{\an1}Come on, man,
it's a masterpiece.

49:35.639 --> 49:37.557
You guLater, bro.le it.

49:37.641 --> 49:38.934
I'm out of here, too.

49:39.017 --> 49:39.643
Donna, you can't leave.

49:39.726 --> 49:41.103
You're my insRight.on for this.

49:41.186 --> 49:44.398
I think everybody's gonna
bail on you at this point.

49:44.481 --> 49:46.733
What time is your
hair appointment?

49:46.817 --> 49:47.901
Brenda, where
are you going?

49:47.984 --> 49:50.779
{\an1}Steve, I'm walking my friends
to their car, is that okay?

49:50.862 --> 49:52.739
{\an1}All right,
all right, go ahead.

49:52.823 --> 49:55.242
Your brother and I'll just wait
here till the paint dries.

49:55.325 --> 49:57.411
In the meantime, I'm sure
he's gonna challenge me

49:57.494 --> 49:59.413
{\an1}to a game of all-world horse,
and in that case,

49:59.496 --> 50:00.288
{\an1}I'm just gonna
have to whip his butt.

50:05.877 --> 50:07.713
Oh, yeah, oh yeah.

50:07.796 --> 50:09.464
The form that made him famous!

50:09.548 --> 50:11.258
So, what was that again?

50:11.341 --> 50:13.093
It's between the legs,
spin in the air,

50:13.176 --> 50:14.386
fade away jumper.

50:14.469 --> 50:15.971
No handstands?
No cartwheels?

50:16.054 --> 50:17.264
None of that,
I'm saving that all

50:17.347 --> 50:18.640
for the playoffs, bigOkay.

50:18.724 --> 50:19.391
Bran, you know one
of the reasons

50:19.474 --> 50:21.435
why you and I
clicked so well

50:21.518 --> 50:23.562
is because you need
me to push you past

50:23.645 --> 50:26.314
the bounds of the normal,
the ordinary, the conventional.

50:26.398 --> 50:28.942
{\an1}Straight into the cesspool
of corruption and depravity.

50:29.025 --> 50:30.444
I wouldn't go that far.

50:30.527 --> 50:31.987
Oh, no?

50:32.070 --> 50:34.740
Do you remember the night
we went out trolling for chicks?

50:35.699 --> 50:37.159
What??

50:37.242 --> 50:38.785
You remember those two
girls who were waiting

50:38.869 --> 50:40.704
{\an1}out in front of the club
when we were trying to get in?

50:40.787 --> 50:42.998
One of them's wearing
a pair of biker shorts

50:43.081 --> 50:45.584
{\an1}with garter belts sticking
out under the stockings

50:45.667 --> 50:48.503
{\an1}and the other one's wearing
one of those tops that

50:48.587 --> 50:51.256
{\an1}looks like a bra, but isn't
a bra, but <i>is </i> a bra.

50:51.339 --> 50:52.299
Yeah, they were hot.

50:52.382 --> 50:54.634
They're coming this way.

50:54.718 --> 50:56.303
Oh, I knew we were
gonna get lucky.

50:56.386 --> 50:58.221
Hi.

50:58.305 --> 50:59.639
Hi.

50:59.723 --> 51:01.308
God, I love your car,
it's so hot.

51:01.391 --> 51:04.770
So what're you ladies
doing this evening?

51:04.853 --> 51:07.147
I don't know.

51:07.230 --> 51:08.815
What <i>are </i> we doing?

51:14.070 --> 51:15.363
I wanna drive it.

51:15.447 --> 51:17.282
What?

51:17.365 --> 51:19.284
Your car, I wanna drive it.

51:19.367 --> 51:21.703
Sure, anytime.

51:21.787 --> 51:23.288
I wanna... I wanna drive it now.

51:23.371 --> 51:25.707
Now?

51:25.791 --> 51:28.335
Um, everybody
out of the car.

51:28.418 --> 51:31.171
Trina wants
to drive it.

51:31.254 --> 51:32.506
Now?

51:32.589 --> 51:35.175
Only for a minute, I wanna
drive around the parking lot.

51:35.258 --> 51:37.511
(gears grinding)

51:37.594 --> 51:39.221
Easy... she's
stripping my gears.

51:42.766 --> 51:44.017
Had enough yet?

51:44.100 --> 51:46.228
No. Come on!

51:47.437 --> 51:49.898
What, what're you doing?

51:53.902 --> 51:55.821
Where you going?

51:55.904 --> 51:57.322
What's going on?

51:57.405 --> 52:00.158
Steve, I don't think
they're coming back.

52:00.242 --> 52:01.952
Brandon, shut up.
They're coming back.

52:02.035 --> 52:04.663
We're gonna wait right
here until they do.

52:05.622 --> 52:08.542
{\an1}I can't believe
what a moron I am.

52:08.625 --> 52:10.585
{\an1}What's my dad gonna
say about this?

52:10.669 --> 52:12.212
{\an1}What if people
at school find out?

52:12.295 --> 52:14.339
I'm gonna be totally humiliated.

52:16.424 --> 52:17.717
You gotta swear.

52:17.801 --> 52:21.555
{\an1}You gotta swear you're not
gonna tell anybody about this.

52:21.638 --> 52:22.973
Scout's honor.

52:24.307 --> 52:28.854
Scout's honor.

52:28.937 --> 52:30.480
No one's ever said
that to me before.

52:32.440 --> 52:35.527
Well, that's
the problem, Steve.

52:35.610 --> 52:37.863
Things like this don't
happen to good Scouts.

52:40.615 --> 52:42.868
Is it too late to join?

52:51.835 --> 52:53.628
I never did make
a very good Boy Scout.

52:53.712 --> 52:55.297
You've come a long way, Steve.

52:55.380 --> 52:58.216
Even Mrs. Teasley thinks so.

52:58.300 --> 52:59.301
Well, my abilities
as a scam artist

52:59.384 --> 53:01.303
have certainly improved anyway.

53:01.386 --> 53:03.930
You know that letter
of recommendation

53:04.014 --> 53:05.265
Mrs. Teasley is
writiYeah.r me?

53:05.348 --> 53:08.268
Well, she's only doing it
because of that $10,000

53:08.351 --> 53:09.394
I won at the
half court shot.

53:09.477 --> 53:12.105
Well, I anonymously
donated that

53:12.188 --> 53:13.398
to the Alvarado
Street School.

53:13.481 --> 53:17.152
That's not a scam, Steve.

53:17.235 --> 53:17.736
That's a good deed.

53:17.819 --> 53:21.031
Yeah, it is a good deed.

53:21.114 --> 53:25.243
But I made sure that
my anonymous donation

53:25.327 --> 53:27.662
was eminently traceable

53:27.746 --> 53:29.331
to a Mr. Hartley
of the Hartley House.

53:29.414 --> 53:33.335
I see, you wanted
to be found out

53:33.418 --> 53:35.337
so you'd be rewarded,
is that it?

53:35.420 --> 53:37.464
Bingo.

53:39.758 --> 53:41.927
{\an1}Still Steve, you took
a big chance with that money.

53:42.010 --> 53:44.012
And either way, a lot
of kids from East L.A.

53:44.095 --> 53:45.305
are gonna have a great
summer thanks to you.

53:45.388 --> 53:47.307
Face it, Sanders.

53:47.390 --> 53:50.977
Deep down you're
a Boy Scout, too.

53:52.187 --> 53:53.480
And you're H-O-R-S.

53:53.563 --> 53:56.650
Not for long, watch this.

53:56.733 --> 53:58.485
Through the legs.

53:58.568 --> 54:00.278
{\an1}H-O-R-S,
through the legs,

54:00.362 --> 54:01.321
{\an1}turn around,
Ready?way jumper.

54:01.404 --> 54:02.864
Here we go.

54:05.700 --> 54:07.035
Walsh!

54:09.412 --> 54:11.373
{\an1}David, do me a favor,
if you're going to mope,

54:11.456 --> 54:14.334
{\an1}would you do it
somewhere else, please?

54:14.417 --> 54:16.127
You know, you're acting
like such a wet noodle.

54:16.211 --> 54:17.504
{\an1}You didn't even ask me how
it went at the Walshes' house.

54:17.587 --> 54:20.674
Yes, we did.sh?

54:20.757 --> 54:21.591
And it's incredible,
you should've been there.

54:23.593 --> 54:26.346
Yeah, well,
the way things are going,

54:26.429 --> 54:27.847
I'm not so sure
I'll be coming tonight.

54:27.931 --> 54:30.016
What are you talking about?

54:30.100 --> 54:32.519
{\an1}We are graduating
for God's sake.

54:32.602 --> 54:33.812
What, are you still upset

54:33.895 --> 54:35.188
about misnumbering
your chemistry test?

54:35.271 --> 54:37.524
Well, I figure if I flunk

54:37.607 --> 54:39.693
they'll still let me
stay another year.

54:39.776 --> 54:41.695
Why would you want to do that?

54:41.778 --> 54:43.321
You already did high school.

54:43.405 --> 54:45.198
I mean, just think about
how much you've done

54:45.281 --> 54:46.324
since the ninth grade.

54:46.408 --> 54:48.910
But that's the problem.

54:48.994 --> 54:51.287
Every time I think
about being a freshman,

54:51.371 --> 54:53.248
I think about Scott.

54:54.416 --> 54:56.876
♪ Breaking up is hard to do ♪

54:56.960 --> 54:58.712
♪ They say that breaking up... ♪

54:58.795 --> 55:00.505
Hi.

55:00.588 --> 55:04.217
{\an1}Hey, I...

55:04.300 --> 55:05.552
I'm sorry about yesterday.

55:05.635 --> 55:09.055
I didn't know the rifle
would weird you out.

55:09.139 --> 55:10.390
You sure did change this summer.

55:10.473 --> 55:13.393
I just went away for vacation.

55:13.476 --> 55:14.936
I didn't change that much.

55:15.020 --> 55:17.731
Well, maybe I did.

55:17.814 --> 55:21.109
Yeah, you're a big man
around here now,

55:21.192 --> 55:24.529
and... and I'm still a geek.

55:24.612 --> 55:26.364
You're not a geek.

55:26.448 --> 55:29.075
Maybe we can hang out next week.

55:29.159 --> 55:32.078
Yeah, I'll call you.

55:32.162 --> 55:34.122
Yeah.

55:35.457 --> 55:37.375
Scott.

55:37.459 --> 55:39.544
Cool it with the guns, will you?

55:39.627 --> 55:42.047
Okay.

55:45.633 --> 55:48.386
DAVID:
<i>(gunshot)</i>

55:49.387 --> 55:52.098
{\an1}Why don't you just tell me
something about Scott.

55:52.182 --> 55:53.266
Just some memory.

55:53.349 --> 55:55.435
Just something that not too
many other people would know

55:55.518 --> 55:56.770
and we'll leave it at that.

55:56.853 --> 55:59.481
Well, he sucked his thumb
till he was eight.

55:59.564 --> 56:01.441
Is that what you had in mind?

56:01.524 --> 56:02.442
Come on, David,
we're putting out this issue

56:02.525 --> 56:04.569
as a tribute to Scott.

56:04.652 --> 56:05.987
Why?

56:06.071 --> 56:08.656
So people can glance at it and
then throw it in the garbage?

56:08.740 --> 56:12.118
No, so people can get some kind
of an idea as to who he was.

56:12.202 --> 56:14.245
Look,(microphone feedback)

56:14.329 --> 56:17.165
He was a jerk who blew himself
away, that's who he was.

56:17.248 --> 56:19.250
You don't know, you left early.

56:19.334 --> 56:22.128
You missed out on the fun part
when he picked up a loaded gun

56:22.212 --> 56:23.630
and twirled it around
like Wyatt Earp.

56:23.713 --> 56:26.299
You weren't there
to see him goof up

56:26.382 --> 56:27.634
and shoot himself
and bleed all over

56:27.717 --> 56:28.968
his mom's Persian rug.

56:29.052 --> 56:30.303
David, the microphone is on.

56:30.386 --> 56:32.472
I don't care.

56:32.555 --> 56:35.809
No one gave a rat's ass
about Scott until he died.

56:35.892 --> 56:37.977
And I was the worst one of all.

56:38.061 --> 56:40.146
He was my best friend
and I dropped him

56:40.230 --> 56:42.941
because he wasn't cool
like you or Kelly or Steve.

56:43.024 --> 56:44.442
David.

56:45.860 --> 56:47.487
So they're looking at me.

56:47.570 --> 56:48.655
So what?

56:48.738 --> 56:51.991
They've been looking
at me for days, Brandon.

56:52.075 --> 56:54.119
I can't even walk through
the hall without somebody

56:54.202 --> 56:56.996
in my face trying to cheer me up
like they're my new best friend.

56:57.080 --> 56:59.582
Well, what about
my old best friend?

57:01.918 --> 57:03.378
It doesn't matter
what you write about him

57:03.461 --> 57:04.671
in that paper, Brandon.

57:04.754 --> 57:05.964
It doesn't matter
what you say

57:06.047 --> 57:07.340
about somebody
once they're gone.

57:07.423 --> 57:10.468
What matters is how you treat
them when they're still here.

57:15.598 --> 57:17.642
(phone ringing)

57:22.105 --> 57:23.857
Hello?

57:23.940 --> 57:25.859
Oh, hi, Donna.

57:25.942 --> 57:27.735
Well, you can ask him yourself.

57:27.819 --> 57:30.155
{\an1}She wants to know
how you're feeling.

57:31.447 --> 57:33.408
I'm starting to come around.

57:34.409 --> 57:36.578
Just let me know
when you're done.

57:40.957 --> 57:43.418
(phone ringing)

57:45.461 --> 57:47.338
Hello?

57:47.422 --> 57:48.339
KELLY (on phone):
Hi.

57:48.423 --> 57:48.756
Hi, what's up?

57:48.840 --> 57:49.757
Not too much.

57:49.841 --> 57:50.717
I'm just getting ready to go out
for my manicure.

57:50.800 --> 57:51.718
I wanted to check in.

57:51.801 --> 57:53.761
I also wanted to say

57:53.845 --> 57:57.432
that I'll never talk about
your bank account again.

57:57.515 --> 57:59.684
It's no one's business,
especially mine.

57:59.767 --> 58:01.561
I appreciate the call.

58:01.644 --> 58:03.188
See you in a couple of hours?

58:03.271 --> 58:05.356
With bells on.

58:05.440 --> 58:08.067
Bye.

58:08.151 --> 58:10.153
(dial tone, phone beeps off)

58:27.587 --> 58:28.630
{\an1}So there I am sitting
at the Senior Breakfast,

58:28.713 --> 58:32.467
and I'm thinking
about Minnesota.

58:32.550 --> 58:35.678
{\an1}And I wanted to say,
"Hey, everybody, I got in."

58:35.762 --> 58:39.474
But something held me back.

58:39.557 --> 58:44.103
Maybe you thought they would
try and convince you to stay?

58:44.187 --> 58:45.730
{\an1}Or maybe I was scared
that they wouldn't.

58:46.856 --> 58:48.858
What do you want to do?

58:51.736 --> 58:54.614
I'm torn.

58:54.697 --> 58:55.740
My surefire remedy
in a case like this

58:55.823 --> 58:58.117
is to just flip a coin.

58:58.201 --> 59:00.745
{\an1}Is that what you did
with me and Kelly?

59:03.706 --> 59:04.749
{\an1}Sorry, that didn't
come out right.

59:04.832 --> 59:06.292
You don't have to answer that.

59:06.376 --> 59:07.752
No, I want to.

59:07.835 --> 59:09.671
Because what I think
you're really asking me is,

59:09.754 --> 59:12.423
if there were no Kelly, would
you and I still be together?

59:14.384 --> 59:15.802
The thought has
crossed my mind.

59:17.887 --> 59:20.473
The truth is...

59:20.556 --> 59:22.684
I don't know.

59:22.767 --> 59:23.810
I loved you more
than I ever thought

59:23.893 --> 59:26.813
I could love anybody,
maybe that was the problem.

59:28.773 --> 59:31.693
It was just too intense
for both of us.

59:31.776 --> 59:35.280
{\an1}Yeah, I guess right
from the start it was...

59:35.363 --> 59:36.656
it was just so volatile.

59:36.739 --> 59:39.284
Look, do you wanna take a walk
on the beach or something?

59:39.367 --> 59:41.452
Oh, yeah, check out the homeless
people? That'll be great.

59:41.536 --> 59:42.662
{\an1}Dylan, I don't know
what happened up there!

59:42.745 --> 59:44.163
That's right,
you don't!

59:44.247 --> 59:45.081
If you'dExcuse me.nish...!

59:45.164 --> 59:47.041
I have a knack for
interrupting things.

59:47.125 --> 59:48.376
I'm real good at interrupting

59:48.459 --> 59:48.960
because I've had just
about enough noise

59:49.043 --> 59:49.836
for one night, okay?!

59:49.919 --> 59:51.713
{\an1}Excuse me, can you
get me a taxi, please?

59:51.796 --> 59:52.714
Forget the taxi!

59:52.797 --> 59:53.881
No, I want a taxi!

59:53.965 --> 59:56.467
No, just come on, damn it!

59:56.551 --> 59:58.720
Stop yelling at me!

01:00:03.266 --> 01:00:05.184
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:00:05.268 --> 01:00:06.686
Just let me go.

01:00:06.769 --> 01:00:09.188
Brenda, I'm an idiot.
Please don't leave.

01:00:09.272 --> 01:00:09.731
You're scaring me!

01:00:09.814 --> 01:00:13.318
I'm sorry.

01:00:15.486 --> 01:00:16.863
Dylan, what happened?

01:00:16.946 --> 01:00:20.366
He just gets to me.

01:00:20.450 --> 01:00:22.368
He always gets to me.

01:00:22.452 --> 01:00:25.038
I don't know what
I'm supposed to...

01:00:25.121 --> 01:00:27.123
(moans)

01:00:27.915 --> 01:00:28.833
It's okay.

01:00:28.916 --> 01:00:30.918
(sobbing)

01:00:49.937 --> 01:00:51.856
{\an1}We did have some
good time, though.

01:00:51.939 --> 01:00:55.401
{\an1}Like that week in Baja
when you taught me how to surf

01:00:55.485 --> 01:00:56.652
and we danced all night.

01:00:56.736 --> 01:00:57.862
Not all night.

01:01:00.615 --> 01:01:02.033
{\an1}Too bad my dad
couldn't understand

01:01:02.116 --> 01:01:03.785
what we weHmm.ll about.

01:01:04.994 --> 01:01:05.912
Where is she?

01:01:05.995 --> 01:01:08.414
She doesn't want to see you.

01:01:08.498 --> 01:01:09.832
That's too bad.

01:01:09.916 --> 01:01:13.419
You tell her to get her
things and come out here.

01:01:13.503 --> 01:01:15.088
I'm sorry, I can't do that.

01:01:15.171 --> 01:01:17.090
I'm not leaving, Daddy.

01:01:17.173 --> 01:01:19.801
You get your bags young
lady, we're going home.

01:01:19.884 --> 01:01:22.220
{\an1}No.

01:01:22.303 --> 01:01:23.971
Not until you accept Dylan
as part of my life.

01:01:26.557 --> 01:01:27.975
We'll talk about it at home.

01:01:28.059 --> 01:01:31.562
That's not good enough.

01:01:36.692 --> 01:01:39.487
Brenda, you come out
h(door closes).

01:01:39.904 --> 01:01:43.449
So what're you gonna do?

01:01:43.533 --> 01:01:45.660
You gonna go down and drag
her out kicking and screaming?

01:01:45.743 --> 01:01:47.286
That's what this has come to.

01:01:47.370 --> 01:01:50.790
Dylan, whatever this
has come to,

01:01:50.873 --> 01:01:54.419
it hasn't come to that.

01:01:55.753 --> 01:01:56.963
I guess that was
the beginning of the end.

01:01:57.046 --> 01:02:00.967
Yeah, for us to live
together at that point

01:02:01.050 --> 01:02:01.926
was a huge mistake.

01:02:02.009 --> 01:02:03.803
{\an1}And you got so
incredibly offended

01:02:03.886 --> 01:02:06.639
{\an1}when I tried to clean
this place up.

01:02:06.722 --> 01:02:08.933
Well, hey, dust adds
a little character.

01:02:10.059 --> 01:02:11.978
{\an1}I guess Kelly
doesn't mind it, huh?

01:02:14.772 --> 01:02:16.441
I guess not.

01:02:16.524 --> 01:02:18.568
{\an1}Was that her
on the phone before?

01:02:18.651 --> 01:02:21.362
Yeah.

01:02:21.446 --> 01:02:23.030
{\an1}Why didn't you
tell her I was here?

01:02:23.114 --> 01:02:24.949
She didn't ask.

01:02:27.452 --> 01:02:29.412
But I have a question
for you, Bren.

01:02:31.414 --> 01:02:32.832
Why'd you come over here?

01:02:36.586 --> 01:02:38.963
I guess I wanted
to say good-bye.

01:02:39.046 --> 01:02:41.674
In private.

01:02:41.757 --> 01:02:43.050
How private?

01:02:46.971 --> 01:02:49.682
(doorbell chimes)

01:02:49.765 --> 01:02:51.142
Ooh, saved by the bell.

01:02:51.225 --> 01:02:53.144
IRIS:
Dylan, are you there?

01:02:53.227 --> 01:02:55.730
{\an3}It figures.

01:02:55.813 --> 01:02:57.398
IsWho else?s?

01:03:04.489 --> 01:03:05.865
{\an1}Do you mind telling me
exactly what it is

01:03:05.948 --> 01:03:08.826
you have against the telephone?

01:03:08.910 --> 01:03:11.871
I'd rather you told me
what it is you have against me.

01:03:11.954 --> 01:03:14.874
That was a very chilly reception
you gave me last night.

01:03:14.957 --> 01:03:17.543
I thought it over,
and it's come to this:

01:03:17.627 --> 01:03:19.378
my bags are packed.

01:03:19.462 --> 01:03:20.755
And either the taxi takes me

01:03:20.838 --> 01:03:22.757
straight to your
graduation ceremony

01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:24.550
or to the airport.

01:03:24.634 --> 01:03:25.635
It's up to you.

01:03:25.718 --> 01:03:29.055
Mom, the graduation,
it doesn't start for 90 minutes.

01:03:31.807 --> 01:03:34.894
I guess I'm still
on Hawaiian time.

01:03:36.646 --> 01:03:38.397
Come on in.

01:03:38.481 --> 01:03:40.525
Say hello to Brenda.

01:03:40.608 --> 01:03:41.984
Brenda!

01:03:42.068 --> 01:03:43.402
{\an1}Iris, hi.
Good to see you.

01:03:43.486 --> 01:03:44.612
Well, it's good to see you.

01:03:44.695 --> 01:03:46.614
I hope I wasn't
interrupting anything.

01:03:46.697 --> 01:03:49.158
{\an1}No, actually
I was just leaving.

01:03:49.242 --> 01:03:51.619
{\an1}I just came to get some
advice from an old friend.

01:03:51.702 --> 01:03:53.621
Bye. I'll see you in 90 minutes.

01:03:53.704 --> 01:03:55.581
Bye.

01:03:59.835 --> 01:04:01.045
KELLY:
Mom.

01:04:01.128 --> 01:04:02.755
I'm getting ready to head over.

01:04:02.838 --> 01:04:03.923
Look for me in the "T's."

01:04:04.006 --> 01:04:05.550
I'll see you there.

01:04:05.633 --> 01:04:07.802
Oh, I'm so proud of you.

01:04:07.885 --> 01:04:08.761
{\an3}Thank you.

01:04:08.844 --> 01:04:10.429
Are you proud of me?

01:04:10.513 --> 01:04:12.431
Yes, you better be.

01:04:12.515 --> 01:04:13.808
You know, she's
getting so big

01:04:13.891 --> 01:04:15.810
and I have known you
your whole life, Erin.

01:04:15.893 --> 01:04:18.771
Just think, if I hadn't
stayed here this summer

01:04:18.854 --> 01:04:20.565
to help you with
the baby, then...

01:04:20.648 --> 01:04:22.066
Dylan and I may have
never gotten together.

01:04:22.149 --> 01:04:24.944
See, sometimes things
do work out.

01:04:25.027 --> 01:04:29.407
Yep, although that
living together idea,

01:04:29.490 --> 01:04:30.783
you don't have to
worry about it.

01:04:30.866 --> 01:04:31.200
It's not in the cards.

01:04:31.284 --> 01:04:31.951
What did he say?

01:04:32.034 --> 01:04:34.120
I didn't even
bring it up.

01:04:34.203 --> 01:04:36.789
I mean, I know he
cares about me,

01:04:36.872 --> 01:04:39.792
but he really is a loner.

01:04:39.875 --> 01:04:42.128
He reminds me of your father.

01:04:42.211 --> 01:04:44.797
{\an1}Let's just hope he
doesn't turn out to be

01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:47.466
{\an1}so much of an emotional
no-show.

01:04:47.550 --> 01:04:49.760
Well, at least Dad called.

01:04:49.844 --> 01:04:52.138
{\an1}Yeah, he should've
been here.

01:04:52.221 --> 01:04:54.765
Well, I think I know what
I'll major in in college.

01:04:54.849 --> 01:04:56.183
{\an3}Psychology.

01:04:56.267 --> 01:04:58.311
I may join you.

01:04:58.394 --> 01:04:59.478
I'll see you over there.

01:04:59.562 --> 01:05:01.814
Wish me luck.

01:05:01.897 --> 01:05:04.650
BRENDA:
<i>Why are you wearing a tie?</i>

01:05:04.734 --> 01:05:07.361
This is a very
solemn occasion.

01:05:07.445 --> 01:05:08.988
I can't believe this
day has finally come.

01:05:09.071 --> 01:05:09.655
Yeah, believe it.

01:05:09.739 --> 01:05:12.700
It's time for the big sayonara.

01:05:12.783 --> 01:05:14.952
{\an3}Yeah.

01:05:22.418 --> 01:05:23.210
We've been
through a lot together

01:05:23.294 --> 01:05:25.588
over the past three years.

01:05:25.671 --> 01:05:27.506
Ah, it's been a piece of cake.

01:05:27.590 --> 01:05:28.799
(scoffs)

01:05:28.883 --> 01:05:32.011
{\an1}Maybe for you, Mr. Confident,
Mr. I've Got It Wired.

01:05:32.094 --> 01:05:34.263
Come on, Bren.

01:05:34.347 --> 01:05:38.684
When we first moved here,
I was pretty spooked.

01:05:38.768 --> 01:05:41.354
That's not how
I remember it.

01:05:41.437 --> 01:05:43.356
I miss Minneapolis.

01:05:43.439 --> 01:05:46.317
No, you don't.

01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:48.152
{\an3}Yeah, I do.

01:05:49.236 --> 01:05:51.906
Nothing was this complicated.

01:05:57.453 --> 01:05:59.497
Brandon, are we going
to make it here?

01:05:59.580 --> 01:06:02.792
Well, the houses are bigger,
the weather's warmer,

01:06:02.875 --> 01:06:05.711
but it doesn't mean they've
cracked the meaning of life,

01:06:05.795 --> 01:06:08.172
know what I mean?

01:06:08.255 --> 01:06:09.799
Yeah, I know.

01:06:15.262 --> 01:06:19.266
{\an1}Yes, I always was a sage,
even as a wee young laddie.

01:06:19.350 --> 01:06:20.559
You know what
else you are?

01:06:20.643 --> 01:06:21.560
(laughs)

01:06:21.644 --> 01:06:22.937
If you can't say
something nice...

01:06:23.020 --> 01:06:25.356
Seriously,
Brandon.

01:06:25.439 --> 01:06:27.525
Okay, Bren, what else am I?

01:06:28.693 --> 01:06:32.530
No matter how crazed or bent
out of shape I ever got,

01:06:32.613 --> 01:06:35.741
you were always there for
me and I'll never forget it.

01:06:35.825 --> 01:06:37.993
You really are
my best friend.

01:06:41.664 --> 01:06:43.833
{\an1}Well, I hope
I always will be.

01:07:11.235 --> 01:07:15.114
{\an4}STEVE:
I can't believe my mom's
here signing autographs.

01:07:15.197 --> 01:07:16.615
And there's my father.

01:07:16.699 --> 01:07:17.825
You like
your dad.

01:07:17.908 --> 01:07:20.619
Yeah, but did he have to bring
the Wicked Witch of the North

01:07:20.703 --> 01:07:22.121
{\an1}and the three flying
monkey children?

01:07:22.204 --> 01:07:23.456
Well, at least he came.

01:07:23.539 --> 01:07:24.582
Yeah, Steve,

01:07:24.665 --> 01:07:25.791
just click your heels
together three times

01:07:25.875 --> 01:07:27.668
and you'll be home
before you know it.

01:07:27.752 --> 01:07:28.961
{\an1}Yeah, well, speaking
of heels, big guy,

01:07:29.044 --> 01:07:30.796
{\an1}those are some
pretty kicking boots.

01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:32.256
{\an1}What did they set you back,
about 800 bucks?

01:07:32.339 --> 01:07:33.340
Just a graduation
present.

01:07:33.424 --> 01:07:35.426
Your mom get you those?

01:07:35.509 --> 01:07:37.303
Steve, what does it
matter where I got 'em

01:07:37.386 --> 01:07:38.304
or how much
they cost?

01:07:38.387 --> 01:07:39.430
They're just
boots, all right?

01:07:46.437 --> 01:07:49.648
So how are you doing?

01:07:49.732 --> 01:07:50.816
I'm psyched.

01:07:50.900 --> 01:07:52.651
{\an1}I made some final adjustments
on my speech

01:07:52.735 --> 01:07:55.362
and if my throat holds out,
I'll be great.

01:07:55.446 --> 01:07:57.865
Good, good,
glad to hear it.

01:07:57.948 --> 01:07:58.407
I'd better get some water.

01:07:58.491 --> 01:08:00.367
I'll be right back.

01:08:03.579 --> 01:08:04.622
{\an1}KELLY (sing-songy):
Donna.

01:08:04.705 --> 01:08:06.165
{\an1}I just wanted
to wish you good luck.

01:08:06.248 --> 01:08:07.792
What's the matter?

01:08:07.875 --> 01:08:08.834
Well, when I think

01:08:08.918 --> 01:08:11.796
if it wasn't for you and
Brandon and everyone,

01:08:11.879 --> 01:08:14.673
I wouldn't
even be here.

01:08:14.757 --> 01:08:17.676
I love you, too.

01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:20.220
Hey, hey, hey, can I
get in on this action?

01:08:20.304 --> 01:08:22.223
{\an1}Well, that's
a major mood swing.

01:08:22.305 --> 01:08:23.765
Yeah, well, I just
talked to Ms. Temaka

01:08:23.849 --> 01:08:25.725
and it seems that I got
the second highest grade

01:08:25.810 --> 01:08:26.977
on my chemistry exam.

01:08:27.060 --> 01:08:28.729
The one you thought you flunked?

01:08:28.813 --> 01:08:30.981
Guess that says something
for misnumbering.

01:08:31.064 --> 01:08:32.483
Guess so.

01:08:32.566 --> 01:08:33.692
{\an1}Oh, come here,
you guys.

01:08:33.776 --> 01:08:35.361
We're graduating!

01:08:37.404 --> 01:08:40.533
{\an1}Hey, Andrea, good
luck on that speech.

01:08:40.616 --> 01:08:41.742
Thank you.

01:08:41.826 --> 01:08:43.828
(chuckles)

01:08:48.541 --> 01:08:50.459
{\an1}I'm real proud
of you, son.

01:08:54.796 --> 01:08:57.716
{\an1}And if it takes the
pressure off, I just want you

01:08:57.800 --> 01:09:01.261
to know that you don't have
to go to college on my account.

01:09:01.345 --> 01:09:03.848
From here on out, you got
to do what's right for you.

01:09:04.932 --> 01:09:08.644
drum roll

01:09:14.024 --> 01:09:17.069
(fanfare playing)

01:09:27.621 --> 01:09:30.374
It's show time!

01:09:30.457 --> 01:09:31.375
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

01:09:31.457 --> 01:09:33.252
Break a leg, chief.

01:09:33.335 --> 01:09:34.252
Thanks, ace.

01:09:34.336 --> 01:09:36.380
Let's do it.

01:10:04.742 --> 01:10:08.370
♪ ♪

01:10:24.887 --> 01:10:26.931
(crowd applauding)

01:10:33.771 --> 01:10:37.149
{\an1}Ladies and gentlemen, may
I present the graduating class

01:10:37.232 --> 01:10:38.359
of nineteen hundred
and ninety-three.

01:11:09.264 --> 01:11:09.682
Andrea, what's the matter?

01:11:09.765 --> 01:11:12.309
I lost my speech.

01:11:12.393 --> 01:11:15.312
H-Hey, Andrea,
don't worry about it.

01:11:15.396 --> 01:11:16.689
You've been over
it so many times

01:11:16.772 --> 01:11:17.523
I'm sure you have it
memorized by now.

01:11:17.606 --> 01:11:19.692
I'm glad that you're
so sure about it

01:11:19.775 --> 01:11:21.610
because I am a complete
and total blank.

01:11:34.957 --> 01:11:37.668
And so I am honored to introduce

01:11:37.751 --> 01:11:41.171
valedictorian
of the class of 1993.

01:11:41.255 --> 01:11:41.630
Ugh!

01:11:41.714 --> 01:11:43.507
I'm seeing spots.

01:11:43.590 --> 01:11:44.758
I am hyperventilating.

01:11:44.842 --> 01:11:46.844
Maybe if you put your head
between your knees.

01:11:46.927 --> 01:11:48.262
{\an1}I'd rather put my tail
between my legs.

01:11:48.345 --> 01:11:49.596
{\an3}Andrea.

01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:52.266
Brandon, I am going to be the
laughingstock of Beverly Hills.

01:11:52.349 --> 01:11:54.226
Nobody is going
to laugh at you.

01:11:54.309 --> 01:11:55.436
Right, they're just going
to throw things at me.

01:11:55.519 --> 01:11:57.604
All right,
knock it off.

01:11:57.688 --> 01:11:58.856
That's enough.

01:11:58.939 --> 01:12:00.232
You're not going to wimp
out on me, you hear?

01:12:00.315 --> 01:12:01.900
On <i>you?</i>

01:12:01.984 --> 01:12:03.027
Damn right
on me.

01:12:03.110 --> 01:12:04.903
I helped you work on
that speech for hours

01:12:04.987 --> 01:12:06.697
and I've listened to
you agonize for years

01:12:06.780 --> 01:12:07.948
over your grade
point average

01:12:08.032 --> 01:12:09.199
and your
permanent record

01:12:09.283 --> 01:12:10.909
and I'm not going
to let you blow this.

01:12:10.993 --> 01:12:12.703
Now, you've practically
got a photographic memory,

01:12:12.786 --> 01:12:14.913
so you get yourself
together, you get up there,

01:12:14.997 --> 01:12:16.373
and you use it,
you hear me?

01:12:16.457 --> 01:12:18.751
{\an1}MEYERS:
As the faculty advisor...

01:12:18.834 --> 01:12:19.793
Thanks, Brandon.

01:12:19.877 --> 01:12:21.920
You're welcome.

01:12:22.004 --> 01:12:24.548
Um, j-just one thing....

01:12:24.631 --> 01:12:26.550
Do you remember
how my speech started?

01:12:26.633 --> 01:12:29.470
And so without
further ado,

01:12:29.553 --> 01:12:32.639
let us all welcome
Andrea Zuckerman,

01:12:32.723 --> 01:12:35.267
valedictorian,

01:12:35.350 --> 01:12:37.936
class of 1993.

01:12:57.539 --> 01:12:59.625
Thank you...

01:12:59.708 --> 01:13:00.626
(microphone feeds back)

01:13:00.709 --> 01:13:01.627
...Mr. Meyers,

01:13:01.710 --> 01:13:04.296
Ms. Teasley, uh,
fellow graduates,

01:13:04.380 --> 01:13:06.924
ladies and gentlemen.

01:13:07.007 --> 01:13:11.804
{\an1}Uh, today we stand here united
as a class.

01:13:11.887 --> 01:13:16.767
Tomorrow we go our separate ways
as individuals...

01:13:16.850 --> 01:13:20.437
on our own... i-individually.

01:13:20.521 --> 01:13:21.855
{\an3}We...

01:13:21.939 --> 01:13:23.857
we do this

01:13:23.941 --> 01:13:27.486
to follow the paths...
unfathomable paths

01:13:27.569 --> 01:13:29.488
which weave
before us...

01:13:29.571 --> 01:13:30.823
Oh, no.

01:13:30.906 --> 01:13:31.824
What's the matter?

01:13:31.907 --> 01:13:33.826
She went back to
the old version.

01:13:33.909 --> 01:13:35.285
(chuckles)

01:13:35.369 --> 01:13:38.330
We do so with the certainty...

01:13:38.413 --> 01:13:40.999
with the certainty...

01:13:41.083 --> 01:13:42.292
(sighs)

01:13:42.376 --> 01:13:43.877
...that we don't have
the faintest idea

01:13:43.961 --> 01:13:44.753
what we're doing at all.

01:13:44.837 --> 01:13:48.173
(laughter)

01:13:48.257 --> 01:13:49.550
(applause)

01:13:52.719 --> 01:13:54.847
Which could be
a very frightening prospect

01:13:54.930 --> 01:13:56.974
in a world where the...

01:13:57.057 --> 01:13:59.184
in a world
where the boundaries of nations

01:13:59.268 --> 01:14:02.187
and the balance of nature
can change overnight,

01:14:02.271 --> 01:14:06.108
except that the years that
we have spent at West Beverly

01:14:06.191 --> 01:14:09.862
have given us the foundation
to face that future.

01:14:09.945 --> 01:14:12.865
We haven't just learned
facts and figures,

01:14:12.948 --> 01:14:14.700
{\an1}logic
and reasoning skills,

01:14:14.783 --> 01:14:19.663
{\an1}but we have learned the value
of friendship...

01:14:19.746 --> 01:14:22.040
friendship, loyalty, and love,

01:14:22.124 --> 01:14:25.335
which will not be diminished
just because we may not

01:14:25.419 --> 01:14:26.712
end up together.

01:14:26.795 --> 01:14:32.426
The memories that we have shared
will not go away

01:14:32.509 --> 01:14:34.386
simply because we do.

01:14:34.469 --> 01:14:38.265
So even if the future
does not always meet

01:14:38.348 --> 01:14:40.392
our expectations

01:14:40.475 --> 01:14:41.768
or the fates
are cruel

01:14:41.852 --> 01:14:43.812
to us at times,

01:14:43.896 --> 01:14:47.024
no one...

01:14:47.107 --> 01:14:50.569
can ever take this moment
from me.

01:14:50.652 --> 01:14:54.781
From me, from you,
from any of us.

01:14:56.783 --> 01:15:01.788
No one can ever take away

01:15:01.872 --> 01:15:04.041
this moment in time.

01:15:04.124 --> 01:15:05.918
(applause)

01:15:30.692 --> 01:15:34.404
COACH CHAPMAN:
Gary Achatell.

01:15:34.488 --> 01:15:36.031
Michael Anderson.

01:15:38.033 --> 01:15:39.952
Ross Anderson.

01:15:40.035 --> 01:15:42.412
You know, they don't really
give you your diploma now.

01:15:42.496 --> 01:15:43.789
{\an1}It's just a blank
piece of paper.

01:15:43.872 --> 01:15:44.831
So does that mean
you don't want it?

01:15:44.915 --> 01:15:47.125
Are you crazy?

01:15:47.209 --> 01:15:49.127
Come on.ng)

01:15:50.879 --> 01:15:53.257
{\an4}STEVE:
Look out, your dad just
took out the video camera.

01:15:53.340 --> 01:15:53.799
DAVID:
Oh, you know how dads are.

01:15:53.882 --> 01:15:56.802
Not really.

01:15:58.095 --> 01:16:00.764
He didn't even have the
courtesy to call this time.

01:16:02.724 --> 01:16:05.811
He had some woman who
claimed to be his secretary

01:16:05.894 --> 01:16:07.980
call and leave
a message for me...

01:16:10.232 --> 01:16:13.443
"Your father's very sorry,

01:16:13.527 --> 01:16:16.780
but he'll make it up
to you next time."

01:16:16.863 --> 01:16:18.865
{\an1}Kel, you gotta believe
there'll be a next time.

01:16:23.870 --> 01:16:24.871
Bradley Luganis.

01:16:24.955 --> 01:16:26.707
(applause)

01:16:26.790 --> 01:16:29.543
Donna's up next.pe.

01:16:30.919 --> 01:16:34.214
Donna Martin.

01:16:40.137 --> 01:16:41.722
I don't intend
to sleep with you.

01:16:41.805 --> 01:16:46.018
Oh, oh-oh-oh,
it's-it's too soon.

01:16:46.101 --> 01:16:46.810
I can see that.

01:16:46.893 --> 01:16:50.731
No, I'm not gonna do that

01:16:50.814 --> 01:16:51.857
with anybody.

01:16:51.940 --> 01:16:53.900
You mean ever?

01:16:53.984 --> 01:16:55.193
Well, with my husband of course.

01:16:55.277 --> 01:16:56.987
I mean, I'm not
entering a convent

01:16:57.070 --> 01:16:58.155
or anything for God's sake.

01:16:58.238 --> 01:17:00.198
It's just...

01:17:00.282 --> 01:17:03.869
for right now, for me,
life is complicated enough

01:17:03.952 --> 01:17:07.748
without getting involved
in a sexual relationship.

01:17:10.792 --> 01:17:14.838
So I guess driving to Vegas
is out of the question?

01:17:25.807 --> 01:17:28.352
Brian Mackelroy.

01:17:28.977 --> 01:17:30.979
Dylan McKay.

01:17:41.907 --> 01:17:42.741
What's this?

01:17:42.824 --> 01:17:44.868
Oh, a little leisure reading.

01:17:44.951 --> 01:17:46.870
<i>Byron, The Collected Works?</i>

01:17:46.953 --> 01:17:51.792
Mad, bad and dangerous to know.

01:17:51.875 --> 01:17:53.794
That was him and that's me.

01:17:59.841 --> 01:18:00.926
Daniel Messlier.

01:18:03.136 --> 01:18:04.971

Janice Thall.

01:19:06.074 --> 01:19:08.702
Ronald Thindell.

01:19:08.785 --> 01:19:10.328
{\an1}Kelly, I never knew
you were so...

01:19:10.412 --> 01:19:11.246
Schmaltzy?

01:19:11.329 --> 01:19:14.124
{\an1}"Sentimental" is the word
I was looking for.

01:19:14.207 --> 01:19:16.668
No, you don't understand.

01:19:16.751 --> 01:19:18.295
My father's here.

01:19:18.378 --> 01:19:19.921
Where?

01:19:21.756 --> 01:19:23.925
Doreen Vantine.

01:19:27.095 --> 01:19:29.139
Elizabeth Walker.

01:19:31.099 --> 01:19:33.393
Brandon Walsh.

01:19:46.323 --> 01:19:48.742
Brenda Walsh.

01:19:55.916 --> 01:19:58.835
You just got to
understand Brenda,

01:19:58.919 --> 01:20:00.962
one minute you're my
little girl and then...

01:20:01.046 --> 01:20:03.673
all of a sudden you're
taking pregnancy tests.

01:20:06.760 --> 01:20:09.888
Things are moving kind
of fast for your old man.

01:20:09.971 --> 01:20:13.308
{\an1}Well, maybe I'm not
your little girl anymore.

01:20:18.688 --> 01:20:20.815
You'll always be my little girl.

01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:35.038
And last, but by no means least,

01:20:35.121 --> 01:20:36.122
Andrea Zuckerman.

01:20:40.001 --> 01:20:42.170
Congratulations, Andrea,

01:20:42.254 --> 01:20:43.755
and good luck at Yale.

01:20:43.838 --> 01:20:46.841
Thank you, Mr. Meyers--
I mean, Gil.

01:20:49.177 --> 01:20:51.930
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Class of 1993.

01:20:52.013 --> 01:20:55.058
(applause)

(cheering)

01:21:14.369 --> 01:21:15.787
{\an1}BRANDON:
Steve, Steve?

01:21:15.871 --> 01:21:16.204
{\an1}What time is everybody
showing up tonight?

01:21:16.288 --> 01:21:18.623
Late, very late.

01:21:18.707 --> 01:21:19.791
AftCool.00.

01:21:19.875 --> 01:21:20.792
Dude, I am psyched.

01:21:20.875 --> 01:21:22.627
{\an1}It's grad night
and you graduated!

01:21:22.711 --> 01:21:24.921
Yes! Yes! Ah!

01:21:25.005 --> 01:21:25.922
CINDY:
Brandon, Steve.

01:21:26.006 --> 01:21:27.799
{\an1}BRANDON:
Come on.

01:21:27.882 --> 01:21:29.968
(shutter clicks)

01:21:30.051 --> 01:21:31.303
Come on, everybody.

01:21:31.386 --> 01:21:33.430
(all talking at once)

01:21:43.064 --> 01:21:45.692
Okay, okay.

01:21:50.697 --> 01:21:52.699
I'll be back.

01:22:05.295 --> 01:22:08.798
{\an1}Well, do you feel
any different?

01:22:08.882 --> 01:22:10.800
{\an3}Yeah, I do.

01:22:10.884 --> 01:22:12.844
It's not because
I got a diploma,

01:22:12.927 --> 01:22:15.180
and this will really
sound bizarre to you.

01:22:15.263 --> 01:22:16.014
I'm all ears.

01:22:16.097 --> 01:22:18.850
I had this
feeling all day,

01:22:18.933 --> 01:22:21.645
very strongly, that
Jack was with us.

01:22:21.728 --> 01:22:23.647
I could swear for a
minute that he was...

01:22:23.730 --> 01:22:25.231
he was talking to me.

01:22:25.315 --> 01:22:28.985
Well, maybe he was.

01:22:29.069 --> 01:22:30.862
{\an1}Let me get a picture
of you two.

01:22:35.784 --> 01:22:37.911
May I take one
of the three of you?

01:22:37.994 --> 01:22:39.913
Oh, I'd love it.red.

01:22:49.798 --> 01:22:51.716
Hey, how're you doing?

01:22:51.800 --> 01:22:52.258
Good.

01:22:52.342 --> 01:22:54.719
Guess where I'm going?

01:22:54.803 --> 01:22:56.054
Dinner with your mom?

01:22:56.137 --> 01:22:57.847
And my dad.

01:22:57.931 --> 01:22:58.431
Your dad?

01:22:58.515 --> 01:23:00.725
So that's
your dad?

01:23:00.809 --> 01:23:01.643
Yep, that's him.

01:23:01.726 --> 01:23:04.062
Now I know how I'm gonna
remember this day.

01:23:04.145 --> 01:23:07.232
It's the day I saw
my mom and my dad

01:23:07.315 --> 01:23:09.901
together in the same place.

01:23:22.330 --> 01:23:25.333
(phone ringing)

01:23:26.668 --> 01:23:27.877
CINDY:
Oh, let me guess.

01:23:27.961 --> 01:23:29.879
It was Brenda calling
to say, "Don't wait up."

01:23:29.963 --> 01:23:31.756
No, it was Dylan.

01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:33.633
He's coming over.

01:23:33.717 --> 01:23:36.094
Now? I mean, it's so late.

01:23:36.177 --> 01:23:37.887
He's coming over
in three minutes.

01:23:37.971 --> 01:23:40.640
He called from his
new cellular phone.

01:23:40.724 --> 01:23:41.599
Nothing quite as
disconcerting

01:23:41.683 --> 01:23:44.269
as the sight of a young
man with cash to burn.

01:23:44.352 --> 01:23:46.479
DYLAN:
<i>Did you ever notice</i>

01:23:46.563 --> 01:23:50.400
how people get
a little weird around money?

01:23:50.483 --> 01:23:51.568
Money'll do that to you.

01:23:51.651 --> 01:23:54.320
{\an1}Yeah, I'm not talking about
the person who gets the money.

01:23:54.404 --> 01:23:57.699
{\an1}I'm talking about
the people around him.

01:23:58.366 --> 01:24:00.827
Well, the biggest trap
that people fall into

01:24:00.910 --> 01:24:02.287
when they suddenly
find themselves

01:24:02.370 --> 01:24:05.915
in a higher
income bracket,

01:24:05.999 --> 01:24:07.375
they start acquiring
a lot of new possessions,

01:24:07.459 --> 01:24:11.296
and new people.

01:24:11.379 --> 01:24:15.425
In the process, they kind of
lose touch with who they were.

01:24:15.508 --> 01:24:19.804
{\an1}Hmm... that's not
gonna happen to me.

01:24:19.888 --> 01:24:21.639
I hope you're right.

01:24:21.723 --> 01:24:24.642
And to be sure...

01:24:24.726 --> 01:24:27.145
{\an1}I want to give
my money back to you.

01:24:28.271 --> 01:24:29.397
In the trust, like before.

01:24:31.399 --> 01:24:33.902
You mean you spent
all that energy

01:24:33.985 --> 01:24:35.862
trying to get the money
out of the trust

01:24:35.945 --> 01:24:37.489
and now you want
to put it back?

01:24:37.572 --> 01:24:40.033
{\an1}I want the same thing,
you know, I mean,

01:24:40.116 --> 01:24:41.326
{\an1}where I get a check every
month for my living expenses.

01:24:41.409 --> 01:24:45.205
{\an1}I just, uh... I'd like it
to be a little more.

01:24:45.288 --> 01:24:47.707
I can understand that.

01:24:47.791 --> 01:24:50.960
And, uh,
I need a sizeable advance.

01:24:51.044 --> 01:24:53.505
I think I'm gonna go bum around
Europe for most of the summer.

01:24:53.588 --> 01:24:55.965
And what about college?

01:24:56.049 --> 01:24:56.508
I don't know.

01:24:56.591 --> 01:24:57.342
I mean, I'm coming back.

01:24:57.425 --> 01:24:58.384
I suppose I'll get there
eventually.

01:24:58.468 --> 01:25:02.347
{\an1}I just,
I-I really need a break, Jim.

01:25:02.430 --> 01:25:03.389
I think Jack would understand.

01:25:06.309 --> 01:25:08.228
{\an1}So...

01:25:08.311 --> 01:25:09.646
you think the trust can be
reinstated?

01:25:11.731 --> 01:25:14.484
I think we can work it out.

01:25:14.567 --> 01:25:17.570
I must say
I'm pleasantly surprised.

01:25:17.654 --> 01:25:20.365
I was afraid that you
might fall into that trap.

01:25:20.448 --> 01:25:23.326
Well, if I ever do,
cut me off, all right?

01:25:23.409 --> 01:25:25.411
Last thing I need
right now is deep pockets.

01:25:25.495 --> 01:25:27.455
{\an1}So...

01:25:27.539 --> 01:25:29.249
if you'll excuse me,

01:25:29.332 --> 01:25:32.710
I got a date
with some fools on the hill.

01:25:32.794 --> 01:25:34.671
What are you guys
doing up there anyway?

01:25:34.754 --> 01:25:35.296
(chuckling):
You'll find out.

01:25:35.380 --> 01:25:38.883
You're as bad as Brandon.

01:25:38.967 --> 01:25:41.928
I'll take that as a compliment.

01:26:01.990 --> 01:26:05.368
Oh, boy.

01:26:05.451 --> 01:26:06.411
Wow, look at the view.

01:26:09.122 --> 01:26:11.291
{\an1}Wait, are you sure
this is the way?

01:26:11.374 --> 01:26:13.418
{\an1}Yeah. We just gotta
be careful.

01:26:13.501 --> 01:26:14.627
{\an3}Of what?

01:26:14.711 --> 01:26:16.546
Lions and tigers and bears.

01:26:16.629 --> 01:26:17.881
(laughing)

01:26:17.964 --> 01:26:19.382
{\an5}BOTH:
Lions and tigers
and bears, oh, my.

01:26:19.465 --> 01:26:22.886
Lions and tigers
and bears...

01:26:22.969 --> 01:26:24.762
Uh-oh.

01:26:24.846 --> 01:26:26.431
{\an4}BRANDON:
Hey, munchkins, glad
you could make it.

01:26:26.514 --> 01:26:28.349
We were about ready
to give up on you.

01:26:28.433 --> 01:26:29.267
{\an1}Well, we came
as soon as we could.

01:26:29.350 --> 01:26:31.811
Yeah, we left this
great club to come here.

01:26:31.895 --> 01:26:33.563
But we had to go
home and change first.

01:26:33.646 --> 01:26:34.564
Let's go get started.

01:26:34.647 --> 01:26:35.899
We already finished.

01:26:35.982 --> 01:26:37.734
You finished without me?

01:26:37.817 --> 01:26:38.735
Yeah, it wasn't so hard.

01:26:38.818 --> 01:26:40.612
Especially when Andrea
went up the embankment

01:26:40.695 --> 01:26:41.779
to set up the pulley.

01:26:41.863 --> 01:26:43.615
Yeah, I never knew
you were so nimble.

01:26:43.698 --> 01:26:45.867
Must be all my years
in the circus.

01:26:45.950 --> 01:26:46.576
You were in the circus?

01:26:46.659 --> 01:26:48.786
ANDREA:
No, I was kidding.

01:26:48.870 --> 01:26:50.455
Though I did have a lot
of circus dreams.

01:26:50.538 --> 01:26:53.708
Last fall when I kept having
to walk on that high wire.

01:26:53.791 --> 01:26:55.293
Wasn't that when you
were waiting to see

01:26:55.376 --> 01:26:56.127
if you got
accepted to Yale?

01:26:56.210 --> 01:26:58.296
No, that was
right before I applied.

01:26:58.379 --> 01:26:59.297
Are you still planning
on going, Andrea?

01:26:59.380 --> 01:27:01.799
Yeah.

01:27:01.883 --> 01:27:03.426
I won't be the first person
to take out a mortgage

01:27:03.509 --> 01:27:05.511
on my future for a great
education...

01:27:05.595 --> 01:27:06.596
even though I'll miss

01:27:06.679 --> 01:27:09.390
{\an1}going to California University
with the rest of you.

01:27:11.851 --> 01:27:14.771
I'm not so sure that's
where I'm going myself.

01:27:14.854 --> 01:27:17.523
{\an1}You'd rather go
to Berkeley, huh?

01:27:17.607 --> 01:27:19.692
I think I'll spend the
summer knocking around Europe

01:27:19.776 --> 01:27:20.860
and then see what happens.

01:27:20.944 --> 01:27:22.320
How cool, bro.

01:27:22.403 --> 01:27:24.322
{\an1}STEVE:
Very cool.

01:27:24.405 --> 01:27:25.990
{\an1}DAVID:
Yeah, I'll say.

01:27:26.616 --> 01:27:29.827
What about you, Bren?
Have you decided yet?

01:27:29.911 --> 01:27:30.578
Decided what?

01:27:32.580 --> 01:27:34.999
Well, I'm not going to Europe,

01:27:35.083 --> 01:27:37.001
{\an1}but I'm not going to
California University either.

01:27:37.085 --> 01:27:38.378
Gonna take some time off?

01:27:38.461 --> 01:27:41.965
{\an1}No, I'm going to go to the
University of Minnesota.

01:27:42.590 --> 01:27:45.468
{\an1}Are you kidding me?
When did you decide this?

01:27:45.551 --> 01:27:47.845
{\an1}Well, I've been
thinking about it

01:27:47.929 --> 01:27:50.431
{\an1}for a few weeks, but I really
only made up my mind today.

01:27:50.515 --> 01:27:53.518
{\an1}And then, during Andrea's
speech, I finally felt sure.

01:27:53.601 --> 01:27:55.019
What did I say?

01:27:55.103 --> 01:27:58.022
{\an1}That even if we didn't
all end up together,

01:27:58.106 --> 01:27:59.857
it would be all right.

01:27:59.941 --> 01:28:02.026
{\an1}The kind of friendships that
we have will last forever.

01:28:08.449 --> 01:28:09.492
I sure will miss you.

01:28:09.575 --> 01:28:11.452
Not more than me.

01:28:11.536 --> 01:28:14.706
Not more than me,
guys, thank you.

01:28:14.789 --> 01:28:17.000
{\an1}Yeah, right. Well,
there are telephones.

01:28:17.083 --> 01:28:18.084
And videophones.

01:28:18.167 --> 01:28:21.004
Steve, you're gonna be
the first guy on your block

01:28:21.087 --> 01:28:22.839
to have one.
I'm so proud of you!

01:28:22.922 --> 01:28:26.259
Are you nodding off already?

01:28:26.342 --> 01:28:28.594
No, I am not nodding off.

01:28:28.678 --> 01:28:29.887
{\an1}Bren, I can't believe
you're leaving?

01:28:29.971 --> 01:28:31.389
KELLY:
I can't believe

01:28:31.472 --> 01:28:32.432
<i>you're </i> leaving.

01:28:32.515 --> 01:28:34.267
Why didn't you say anything?

01:28:34.350 --> 01:28:36.269
I don't know...

01:28:36.352 --> 01:28:39.605
I figure I'll start in
Norway, work my way south,

01:28:39.689 --> 01:28:43.443
you know, maybe go to Paris,
jump over to London,

01:28:43.526 --> 01:28:44.861
see some Shakespeare
country,

01:28:44.944 --> 01:28:46.738
and just keep
going south

01:28:46.821 --> 01:28:48.531
until I find
the nicest beach

01:28:48.614 --> 01:28:51.409
{\an3}in Greece.

01:28:51.492 --> 01:28:53.077
You got a passport?

01:28:55.496 --> 01:28:57.623
Why, do you want me to go?

01:28:57.707 --> 01:28:59.542
No, I wanna borrow it.

01:28:59.625 --> 01:29:01.627
Of course,
I want you to go.

01:29:01.711 --> 01:29:04.005
Oh, I'd love to!

01:29:04.088 --> 01:29:08.301
It's been a great ride
with you guys.

01:29:08.384 --> 01:29:09.427
Hey, it's not over
yet, brother.

01:29:09.510 --> 01:29:10.928
Aren't you tired?

01:29:11.012 --> 01:29:13.431
No way.

01:29:14.682 --> 01:29:17.435
Come on sleepyheads.

01:29:17.518 --> 01:29:19.437
This is your wakeup call.

01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:21.272
What time is it?

01:29:21.355 --> 01:29:22.899
Time to roll
outta here, let's go.

01:29:22.982 --> 01:29:25.943
Where we going?

01:29:26.027 --> 01:29:28.988
{\an1}To get a better view
of our legacy.

01:29:29.072 --> 01:29:30.948
