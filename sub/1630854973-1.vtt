WEBVTT

00:53.750 --> 00:55.375
 Oh! Love it!

00:55.375 --> 00:58.208
"Trouble"! One of the greatest
Elvis songs of all time.

00:58.208 --> 00:59.125
How was the sound?

00:59.125 --> 01:01.041
Hell yeah. Felt great.

01:01.041 --> 01:03.458
But since that song's about
beating the shit out of somebody,

01:03.458 --> 01:05.458
which is great in its own way,

01:05.458 --> 01:07.583
maybe we try something more...

01:08.708 --> 01:09.791
Christmassy?

01:10.291 --> 01:14.666
Yeah. I'm having kinda second thoughts
about the whole Christmas angle.

01:14.666 --> 01:16.375
I hear you. Great. Good thought.

01:16.375 --> 01:19.416
So, let's try one
with Tiny Tim and the Elvis Elves.

01:22.458 --> 01:23.291
Thoughts?

01:34.541 --> 01:35.416
Ladies.

01:36.208 --> 01:38.916
Oh, for fuck's sake, Scatter.

01:39.458 --> 01:42.416
I guess "Wait in the limo"
is a little too open-ended, huh?

01:42.416 --> 01:43.541
What the hell?

01:43.541 --> 01:45.833
You said we'd get to hang out with Elvis.

01:48.541 --> 01:50.958
Now, you realize
that vest has pockets, right?

01:58.500 --> 01:59.833
<i>Hello?</i>

01:59.833 --> 02:01.708
Oh hey, baby. Did I call too late?

02:01.708 --> 02:04.833
Only for one of us,
and she's sound asleep.

02:04.833 --> 02:06.416
<i>Well, give her a kiss for me, will you?</i>

02:06.416 --> 02:08.500
You sound tired, baby. You doing okay?

02:08.500 --> 02:10.333
I don't know, 'Cilla.

02:10.333 --> 02:13.541
Feels like the world out there
is going insane, and I'm stuck here

02:13.541 --> 02:16.375
doing a shitty Christmas show
the Colonel locked me into.

02:16.375 --> 02:19.208
Aw, I'm sure the show will be great.

02:19.208 --> 02:21.416
Yeah. You mean
the one with the Elvis Elves?

02:21.416 --> 02:22.666
Come on. "Elvis Elves"?

02:22.666 --> 02:25.000
Trust me,
it's actually worse than it sounds.

02:25.000 --> 02:25.958
No way.

02:27.750 --> 02:29.500
Hello? 'Cilla?

02:29.500 --> 02:31.125
Hey, ace, what happened to the phone?

02:31.125 --> 02:33.291
Sorry, just trying to speed things up.

02:33.291 --> 02:34.250
Speed what up?

02:35.958 --> 02:37.458
My job. Killing you.

02:38.041 --> 02:39.750
Oh, and for whatever reason,

02:39.750 --> 02:43.041
they wanted you to hear this
while you, you know, die.

02:43.041 --> 02:44.625
Did he just say, "Killing me"?

02:46.875 --> 02:47.833
Goulet?

02:48.458 --> 02:51.958
Well, this fucking day
just keeps getting better and better.

02:57.375 --> 02:59.791
Damn it, Scatter! You shot me!

03:03.333 --> 03:06.791
I swear to God, I should have
never gotten out of bed this morning.

03:06.791 --> 03:08.666
- Oh what, huh?

03:08.666 --> 03:10.458
I'm not allowed to have a bad day?

03:13.625 --> 03:14.541
Aw, shit!

03:35.500 --> 03:39.708
Look here, pal. I've had a shit day,
so I'm gonna go ahead and kick your ass.

03:39.708 --> 03:40.708
Hyah!

03:43.708 --> 03:45.666
Huh? What in the hell?

03:45.666 --> 03:47.250
Holy shit. Is that Elvis?

03:49.291 --> 03:51.500
<i>♪ For the next three weeks

03:51.500 --> 03:53.041

03:55.625 --> 03:57.708

04:28.833 --> 04:29.833
Sorry about that.

04:30.750 --> 04:33.000
Oh my God, Elvis. That was amazing.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.250
What was all that?

04:34.833 --> 04:35.958
Oh that? Yeah.

04:35.958 --> 04:38.125
You know, that... That was a rehearsal.

04:38.125 --> 04:40.333
It's what I'm doing for my new TV show.

04:40.333 --> 04:42.250
Jesus, is that guy okay?

04:42.250 --> 04:44.291
Oh yeah,
that's just fake blood, everybody.

04:44.291 --> 04:45.708
And that there is fake, uh...

04:45.708 --> 04:47.500
Well, whatever that is. And--

04:47.500 --> 04:48.958
What's the new show called?

04:59.583 --> 05:01.375
Rise and shine, asshole.

05:01.375 --> 05:03.375
Oh, where am I?

05:04.041 --> 05:06.750
Oh, you are fucking dead. I'll fucking--

05:06.750 --> 05:08.541
Jesus Christ.

05:08.541 --> 05:11.750
You gotta be dumber
than a mud fence to be talking right now.

05:11.750 --> 05:14.125
That's my friend, Bobby Ray.

05:14.125 --> 05:15.666
You might want to listen to him.

05:16.250 --> 05:20.666
Which house rule
am I thinking about right now?

05:20.666 --> 05:23.041
Definitely not the one
about personal space.

05:23.041 --> 05:27.541
You promised none of your vigilante
nonsense in this house, remember?

05:27.541 --> 05:29.416
Won't even know we're here,
Miss Bertie.

05:29.416 --> 05:32.833
Hey, when I get out of this,
I'm gonna fucking--

05:33.458 --> 05:34.333
More or less.

05:34.958 --> 05:35.791
Mm.

05:36.541 --> 05:38.416
That was Bertie, my rock.

05:38.416 --> 05:41.375
Runs everything around here,
known me since I was in diapers.

05:41.375 --> 05:45.708
And speaking of diapers, you see my chimp,
Scatter, over there with the hand cannon?

05:47.750 --> 05:49.958
That is a problem for you, friend.

05:49.958 --> 05:51.625
You see, I decided a while ago,

05:51.625 --> 05:54.791
I wasn't gonna just sit around
while this country's torn apart

05:54.791 --> 05:59.583
by all the chaos, the dirtbag hippies,
the drugs, the crime.

05:59.583 --> 06:01.791
No, no, no, not on my watch.

06:01.791 --> 06:02.708
But Scatter here?

06:02.708 --> 06:05.583
Hell, he just does it
because he gets off to it.

06:05.583 --> 06:07.375
Not where I was going with that.

06:07.375 --> 06:09.583
- You know, here's an idea.

06:09.583 --> 06:12.166
Maybe try not
being disgusting all the time,

06:12.166 --> 06:16.250
including in the hot tub that you clogged
with your damn monkey spunk.

06:16.250 --> 06:18.250
That filter looked like a war crime!

06:18.958 --> 06:22.708
Look at me. Here and now is
where you tell me who sent you to kill me.

06:22.708 --> 06:24.625
Fuck you, singer boy.

06:24.625 --> 06:26.166
They're not paying me to talk.

06:26.166 --> 06:28.250
They? Well, who the hell's "they"?

06:29.041 --> 06:33.541
Now you listen to me, scumbag. I promise
you Scatter's going to pull that trigger...

06:33.541 --> 06:35.583
-  Oh fuck!

06:36.083 --> 06:37.291
"If"!

06:37.291 --> 06:40.500
Goddamn it, Scatter.
I was gonna say, "If" he didn't talk!

06:42.208 --> 06:45.458
Not sticking up for the chimp here,
boss, but it was a little confusing.

06:45.458 --> 06:46.625
 So...

06:46.625 --> 06:49.500
is this me not knowing you're here?

06:49.500 --> 06:51.083
Just a little hiccup, Miss Bertie.

06:51.083 --> 06:53.000
Just a little hiccup. Everything's fine.

06:53.875 --> 06:56.291
Though technically
the living room has seen better days.

06:56.291 --> 06:58.916
You know, there are ways

06:58.916 --> 07:01.916
to turn you into
a quarter-sleeve cardigan.

07:01.916 --> 07:04.458
You need to clean this up, now.

07:04.458 --> 07:06.750
Because that sweater thing
sounded real specific.

07:09.333 --> 07:11.791
- Yeah. Like I know where the mop is.

07:11.791 --> 07:13.333
- Pull!

07:15.416 --> 07:19.208
I swear this crime-fighting crap's
gonna get you killed one day.

07:19.208 --> 07:21.375
Yeah, but this one wasn't my fault.

07:21.375 --> 07:24.250
The guy with the exploded head
started the whole damn thing.

07:24.250 --> 07:26.041
Just like that, huh?

07:26.041 --> 07:28.750
All I know is somebody wants me dead.

07:28.750 --> 07:29.708
Pull!

07:31.250 --> 07:33.750
You know, my money's on them Bolivians.

07:33.750 --> 07:35.291
Negatory.

07:35.291 --> 07:38.541
All those guys
are not really around anymore.

07:38.541 --> 07:40.583
What is that? A to-go bag?

07:40.583 --> 07:41.833
Put that shit back.

07:42.625 --> 07:45.125
Hey! What about that mob guy
you ran into in Miami

07:45.125 --> 07:46.750
when you were doing that Sinatra show?

07:47.958 --> 07:49.125
<i>Definitely not him.</i>

07:49.125 --> 07:51.166
There's that biker gang from last month.

07:55.708 --> 07:57.750
Not after that explosion, there isn't.

07:57.750 --> 07:59.958
Or maybe just another jealous husband

07:59.958 --> 08:03.916
sick of his wife flooding her basement
every time you're on the TV... Ow!

08:03.916 --> 08:05.833
Doesn't really narrow it down, does it?

08:05.833 --> 08:08.750
Besides, though, this felt different.
This guy... This guy was a pro.

08:08.750 --> 08:10.625
You even hear yourself?

08:10.625 --> 08:13.291
I promised your mama
I was gonna look after you,

08:13.291 --> 08:15.166
but if she was alive today, she'd--

08:15.166 --> 08:18.958
Say, "Thank you, Elvis, for trying
to make the world a better place."

08:19.458 --> 08:22.166
"You're such a good boy, Elvis.
How about a snack?"

08:22.166 --> 08:24.458
Oh, and then Mom would
probably cover her ears,

08:24.458 --> 08:26.416
because this is going to get real loud.

08:26.416 --> 08:28.166
Wait, wait, wait! Check it out, E.

08:28.166 --> 08:30.833
Got bored and souped up
a pair of your sunglasses for you.

08:32.416 --> 08:34.125
Yeah.

08:34.916 --> 08:35.875
Watch this.

08:45.125 --> 08:46.041
Hang on.

08:46.041 --> 08:49.666
What happened to all the Christmas stuff?
There was a bunch of tinsel and shit.

08:49.666 --> 08:51.166
I'm taking this thing over.

08:51.166 --> 08:53.125
It's not gonna be
a Christmas special anymore.

08:53.125 --> 08:54.041
Well, what then?

08:54.041 --> 08:55.416
Glad you asked, buddy.

08:55.416 --> 08:58.708
Because if I can dream,
this show's gonna make a statement.

08:58.708 --> 09:00.333
- A statement?
- Damn straight.

09:00.333 --> 09:02.291
Just full-tilt rock and roll, boys,

09:02.291 --> 09:05.083
how we used to do it before
all the movies and all the bullshit.

09:05.083 --> 09:08.375
Now, that, my chiseled friend,
is what I'm talking about.

09:08.375 --> 09:10.250
Just you and the boys cranking it out.

09:10.250 --> 09:12.125
Already got Scotty and DJ on a plane.

09:12.125 --> 09:14.000
- Blowing the fucking doors off.
<i>-</i> Always.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.791
If we deck this place out
with, like, a shit-ton of balloons...

09:16.791 --> 09:18.500
-  What?
<i>-</i>...multicolored streamers,

09:18.500 --> 09:20.333
and... Ooh! Bunting.

09:21.166 --> 09:23.125
Absolutely not. Go get the car.

09:25.750 --> 09:27.291
-  Excuse me.

09:28.125 --> 09:30.833
Well, well, well.
Lady One, Lady Two, Lady Three.

09:30.833 --> 09:34.291
Yes, ma'am, yes, ma'am, and yes, ma'am.
Now, how'd you get in here?

09:34.291 --> 09:36.125
Any chance we can get a picture?

09:36.125 --> 09:38.583
Well, sure thing, you bet. Come here now.

09:41.000 --> 09:44.125
Okay, last one, I swear.

09:44.125 --> 09:45.916
Sure, anything for the fans.

09:48.333 --> 09:50.708
Which you, apparently, are not.

09:50.708 --> 09:53.791
Okay, piggy, let's see those teeth.

09:54.416 --> 09:56.458
- Say--
- Wait. I think I know this one.

09:56.458 --> 09:57.750
Cheese, dipshits!

09:59.916 --> 10:01.041
Hyah!

10:07.041 --> 10:08.958
Now that's what I'm talking about.

10:23.958 --> 10:25.375
That was fucking weird, huh?

10:25.375 --> 10:27.708
- What the hell was all that?
- Just doing my job.

10:27.708 --> 10:29.708
- Sorry?
-  Don't be. Later, gator!

10:31.166 --> 10:33.166
Uh, okay.

10:33.166 --> 10:34.500
I have a few notes.

10:35.791 --> 10:38.250
You mind telling me
what the hell's going on?

10:38.250 --> 10:43.416
Okay, this is gonna sound
a little/extremely weird, but

10:43.416 --> 10:45.375
- you're on a kill list.

10:46.083 --> 10:48.041
I know. Sucks, am I right?

10:54.291 --> 10:55.958
Hey, what's up, boss man?

10:55.958 --> 10:57.541
Think I might be on a kill list.

10:57.541 --> 10:59.625
Hmm. Well, that sucks.

10:59.625 --> 11:00.958
Scatter, you got her?

11:03.500 --> 11:06.458
Oh, you sure this is a good idea, E?

11:06.458 --> 11:09.583
When someone says, "Kill list,"
I've got a few follow-up questions.

11:09.583 --> 11:14.333
No. I mean, trusting the chimp
to track some woman's... lady parts scents.

11:14.833 --> 11:15.750
Scatter's got it.

11:15.750 --> 11:17.541
Does he? Because last time we tried this,

11:17.541 --> 11:19.833
we ended up
at Gloria Steinem's crawfish boil.

11:24.166 --> 11:25.500
You boys stay with the car,

11:25.500 --> 11:30.791
which means not buying coked-up hookers,
he said really clearly this time.

11:31.708 --> 11:33.583
If I'm not back in five, come and get me.

11:46.083 --> 11:47.666
Mr. Presley?

11:47.666 --> 11:48.958
You got room for one more?

11:48.958 --> 11:51.416
Of course, sir. Let me just check.

11:51.416 --> 11:53.666
At ease, ace.
Wasn't really asking.

11:58.416 --> 12:00.875
Now, there she is. Never got your name.

12:00.875 --> 12:02.583
No. And there's a reason for that.

12:02.583 --> 12:03.875
I want some answers.

12:03.875 --> 12:08.458
No, I think what you really want
is the scallops mimosa. Oh!

12:08.458 --> 12:10.583
- Sorry?
- Oh God, you won't be. Trust me.

12:10.583 --> 12:14.208
First time I tried some,
so good I literally shit my pants.

12:14.208 --> 12:16.875
You know, hearing that out loud,
they may have been undercooked--

12:16.875 --> 12:19.375
- Skip to the kill list.
- Oh, that.

12:19.375 --> 12:21.416
- Yeah, somebody wants you dead.
- Who?

12:21.416 --> 12:23.708
The name Charlie Manson
mean anything to you?

12:25.791 --> 12:28.750
Ooh. Oh, you are bad!

12:29.250 --> 12:31.875
Oh no. Don't you fucking do it, Jughead!

12:31.875 --> 12:34.416
Hey there, daddy-o. Borrow a light?

12:34.416 --> 12:38.250
Ooh! Yes, ma'am.
You can borrow whatever the hell you want:

12:38.250 --> 12:40.541
a light, my car keys, my spleen.

12:41.041 --> 12:43.333
We'll borrow you too,
while we're at it, Jack.

12:43.333 --> 12:45.500
Don't just stand there, pick him up!

12:45.500 --> 12:47.375
Am I talking to myself here?

12:47.375 --> 12:51.416
That wasn't rhetorical. I'm really asking.
I've got six voices in my head right now.

12:52.125 --> 12:53.208
Absolute psychopath...

12:54.875 --> 12:59.666
...who, small side note,
technically just kidnapped your friend.

12:59.666 --> 13:02.416
- What?
- The one not wearing a diaper. Bobby Ray.

13:02.416 --> 13:04.125
Oh, the fucking waiter just tell you that?

13:04.125 --> 13:08.000
"Oh, did the fucking waiter..." Yeah.
We've got eyes everywhere. Creepy, right?

13:08.000 --> 13:09.833
You're not kidding. Where'd they take him?

13:09.833 --> 13:11.625
- Can't tell you that.
- You're coming with me.

13:11.625 --> 13:14.458
And cancel dinner
with a not-too-clingy radiologist

13:14.458 --> 13:16.791
with size 13 shoes and a beach house?

13:16.791 --> 13:18.375
I don't think so.

13:18.375 --> 13:19.333
Try again.

13:21.166 --> 13:23.083
Mm. Careful.

13:26.416 --> 13:29.875
You don't look like an honorary
Shelby County deputy to me.

13:30.541 --> 13:33.916
You mind telling me why
Dean Martin has a .38 aimed at my head?

13:33.916 --> 13:35.791
That feels like a you problem.

13:35.791 --> 13:37.875
Well, speaking of "you problems,"

13:37.875 --> 13:40.791
if this Manson guy
really did take Bobby Ray...

13:45.333 --> 13:49.250
...then you're about to see
why we don't let Scatter drive. Ever.

13:58.500 --> 13:59.750
Let's take a ride.

14:05.333 --> 14:06.916
- Hey!

14:10.708 --> 14:12.291
It's called Spahn Ranch.

14:12.291 --> 14:14.458
It used to be
a movie set for old westerns.

14:14.458 --> 14:16.125
Huh. Looks like nobody's home.

14:16.125 --> 14:18.625
No?
Well, "nobody" sure has a lot of horses.

14:18.625 --> 14:19.541
Good point.

14:19.541 --> 14:22.458
No shit. Trust me. This is home base
for Manson and his people.

14:22.458 --> 14:25.625
So, now can we cool it
with whatever the fuck this is?

14:28.375 --> 14:30.333
Oh. Don't mind if I do.

14:30.916 --> 14:32.541
You're my new favorite.

14:34.375 --> 14:35.958
Only one way to find out.

14:36.500 --> 14:38.083
You can get out now.

14:38.083 --> 14:39.708
Hey, what do you think you're do...

14:53.000 --> 14:56.291
Uh, what am I doing? My job,
which is keeping you unmurdered.

14:56.291 --> 14:58.375
And more importantly,
getting high with a monkey.

14:58.375 --> 15:00.250
Either way, can we hurry this up?

15:06.833 --> 15:09.875
So boring.
You know your friend's already dead--

15:09.875 --> 15:11.541
Hey, let me tell you something.

15:11.541 --> 15:13.291
Bobby Ray grew up in the backwoods,

15:13.291 --> 15:16.250
where the only things to do were
making moonshine and catching rabies.

15:16.250 --> 15:17.291
Uh-huh.

15:17.291 --> 15:20.208
And what is your insanely grim point here?

15:20.208 --> 15:21.791
Bobby Ray is a survivor.

15:23.916 --> 15:25.166
- Stay here.

15:25.166 --> 15:26.291
Done.

15:32.833 --> 15:34.750
Goddamn it, Bobby Ray.

15:57.083 --> 15:59.500
-  Sweet mother of God.

16:00.416 --> 16:03.375
Hey! Hey, they may be coming back soon.

16:03.375 --> 16:05.333
So let's get you out of here.

16:05.333 --> 16:07.541
What? No, I mean to fuck me again.

16:07.541 --> 16:11.375
Seriously, E, these batshit-crazy
free-love chicks are on fire.

16:11.375 --> 16:13.083
Uh, is that blood?

16:13.083 --> 16:17.041
Okay, yeah, the sex got a little dark.
Not proud of it, but I'd do it again.

16:18.583 --> 16:20.166
What in the hell is that?

16:23.541 --> 16:26.000
Whoa, whoa, easy with the gun, man.

16:26.583 --> 16:28.333
What's with all the hostility?

16:28.833 --> 16:31.000
You assholes kidnapped my friend.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
Kidnapped?

16:33.833 --> 16:36.791
Who are you,
the charred remains of my last lawyer?

16:37.416 --> 16:40.708
No, we just borrowed your friend
to get you here.

16:41.208 --> 16:43.916
Now, relax, grab a seat.

16:43.916 --> 16:46.791
We're all friendly here.

16:47.750 --> 16:49.958
-  Join us.
-  Come join us, man.

16:49.958 --> 16:51.416
- Right.
- Hey, E?

16:51.416 --> 16:53.000
Maybe let's get the hell out of here.

16:54.958 --> 16:58.833
So, you gonna introduce us
to your fun new friends?

16:58.833 --> 17:00.958
- Just fucking drive, Bobby Ray.
- Yep!

17:03.375 --> 17:06.875
Step on it. Maybe I can still make dinner
with Dr. Timmy and his insanely big...

17:19.791 --> 17:20.708
What?

17:22.208 --> 17:23.416
Nice nap?

17:23.416 --> 17:24.750
What the hell is this?

17:24.750 --> 17:26.083
Oh, this?

17:26.083 --> 17:29.375
This is the gallows they used
filming <i>Linda and Abilene,</i>

17:29.375 --> 17:32.375
an underappreciated psychosexual western.

17:32.375 --> 17:33.916
And these folks here?

17:33.916 --> 17:36.500
These are my people, man!

17:36.500 --> 17:38.708
- Thank you, yes!

17:39.625 --> 17:43.250
So are they here to just fuck around in
the dirt or to watch you try and kill me?

17:43.250 --> 17:46.625
Kill you? Oh no, brother.
What the hell are you talking about?

17:46.625 --> 17:47.916
-  The kill list.
- Ugh.

17:47.916 --> 17:50.333
I told Bloodlust Charlie
not to call it that.

17:50.333 --> 17:52.500
But then Angry Charlie told me,
"Shut the fuck up!"

17:52.500 --> 17:53.791
- No, you shut up.
- You shut up!

17:53.791 --> 17:55.625
- Be quiet.
- Whose voice is that?

17:55.625 --> 17:56.708
Everyone be quiet.

17:56.708 --> 17:58.000
Shh.

17:58.000 --> 18:01.083
Nothing completely insane
about any of that.

18:01.083 --> 18:02.041
Can I go now?

18:02.041 --> 18:03.041
Sure.

18:03.041 --> 18:05.041
Well, assuming you want
to join the family.

18:05.041 --> 18:06.916
Family? What fucking family?

18:06.916 --> 18:09.375
We're all brothers and sisters here, man.

18:09.375 --> 18:11.708
We're a family. Seriously.

18:11.708 --> 18:13.333
Jerry over there does the dishes.

18:13.333 --> 18:15.208
Martha's in charge of snacks.

18:15.208 --> 18:16.500
Frank gets the drugs.

18:16.500 --> 18:18.958
Betty over there,
well, she gets drugs too.

18:18.958 --> 18:21.791
Actually, pretty much
everybody else gets drugs.

18:21.791 --> 18:23.833
Don't forget to get drugs, everybody!

18:23.833 --> 18:25.541
Now, I know what you're thinking.

18:25.541 --> 18:28.250
You're worried you might not fit in.

18:28.250 --> 18:29.625
Losing sleep over it.

18:29.625 --> 18:31.583
You just got to give it time, man.

18:31.583 --> 18:34.833
After we force-feed you LSD
for three straight months,

18:34.833 --> 18:38.666
I promise you, you're gonna feel the love.

18:38.666 --> 18:42.833
And by that, I mean
we fuck each other constantly, am I right?

18:44.666 --> 18:47.333
Yeah, bravo. Afraid I'm not your guy.

18:47.333 --> 18:49.875
Of course you are. Don't you get it?

18:49.875 --> 18:50.791
Pretend I don't.

18:50.791 --> 18:52.625
You and me, we're the same.

18:52.625 --> 18:57.875
We're both electric personalities,
making music that'll change the world.

18:57.875 --> 18:59.375
- Music?
- With the help of you

18:59.375 --> 19:02.916
and everybody else on this list,
I'm going all the way to the top.

19:02.916 --> 19:03.916
What the hell are you--

19:09.958 --> 19:11.083
Sweet mother of God.

19:11.083 --> 19:13.291
Does that answer your question?

19:13.291 --> 19:15.791
- Not the way I think you wanted.
- So what do you say?

19:15.791 --> 19:17.416
Yes. Say yes.

19:17.416 --> 19:20.500
I'd say, if I wanted to hang out
with a bunch of shitbag hippies,

19:20.500 --> 19:22.375
I'd return Dennis Hopper's phone calls.

19:26.416 --> 19:28.416
- E!
- Oh, goddamn it.

19:28.416 --> 19:31.583
You know, I'm not so much angry
as I am disappointed.

19:31.583 --> 19:33.041
I blame myself, really.

19:33.041 --> 19:35.291
The king piggy goes down, man.

19:35.291 --> 19:39.375
Charlie! Charlie! Charlie!

19:39.375 --> 19:40.291
Hey.

19:40.916 --> 19:43.250
You owe me a new badge, dickhead.

19:46.916 --> 19:49.166
Oh God. Oh Daddy, is anything broken?

19:50.083 --> 19:51.250
Get him.

19:51.791 --> 19:54.500
Okay, some of those
seem awfully big to keep in your pants.

20:20.416 --> 20:22.291
Huh. Well, that's new.

20:22.291 --> 20:23.791
They're not going down!

20:23.791 --> 20:26.250
They're like hippie zombies!

20:26.250 --> 20:27.625
Even better.

20:27.625 --> 20:29.875
They're so high, they can't feel a thing.

20:29.875 --> 20:32.291
It's beautiful, man!

20:32.291 --> 20:35.291
Blah, blah, blah!
God, it's nonstop with that guy.

20:37.625 --> 20:39.375
No! Let go!

20:58.416 --> 20:59.500
Shit.

21:01.750 --> 21:04.125
Hey, jackass. This...

21:04.125 --> 21:05.708
This is why I didn't want to come here.

21:05.708 --> 21:07.333
No!

21:08.708 --> 21:10.166
Fucking animals!

21:10.166 --> 21:13.083
Look what you did to my beautiful family.

21:13.666 --> 21:15.625
Now you have to pay.

21:15.625 --> 21:17.416
- Huh. Okay.
- A grenade?

21:18.125 --> 21:19.250
- Ah!

21:23.041 --> 21:25.833
<i>Planet of the Apes.</i>
God, he loves that movie.

21:26.458 --> 21:27.416
Aw, fuck.

21:33.791 --> 21:37.333
You killed my sister/daughter-wife!

21:37.333 --> 21:38.833
You fucking ass--

21:43.416 --> 21:47.250
Say, I've been meaning to ask you.
Nice outfit. What kind of leather's that?

21:47.250 --> 21:50.291
- Italian. I'm not an animal.
- Where do you get something like that?

21:50.291 --> 21:52.458
With your waistline? You don't.

21:54.750 --> 21:56.333
You sure we can't give you a ride?

21:56.333 --> 21:59.875
Nope, nope. Got some cleaning up to do.
Don't worry, we got people.

22:04.625 --> 22:05.625
"We" being...?

22:05.625 --> 22:08.416
- Good luck with the show.
<i>-</i> Hey, speaking of... Bobby Ray!

22:08.416 --> 22:11.125
- Yo!
- Score our new friend here some tickets.

22:11.125 --> 22:13.416
Oh. Thanks, but no, thanks.

22:13.416 --> 22:15.208
Not a big rock and roll fan, huh?

22:15.208 --> 22:16.875
Sure, sure, let's go with that.

You tell me, boss. How'd he do
on your little fake limo assassin test?

23:11.708 --> 23:15.083
Yeah, um, been meaning
to talk to you about that.

23:16.916 --> 23:19.000
- What?
- Were you and Doug... close?

23:19.000 --> 23:21.708
I don't know, we were kinda dating,
mostly over-the-pants stuff, why?

23:21.708 --> 23:22.625
Mm. Mm-hmm.

23:22.625 --> 23:26.416
Well, because I gave Doug
the limo assignment, and it didn't go...

23:26.916 --> 23:28.041
Gosh, what's the word?

23:28.041 --> 23:29.041
Uh, perfectly.

23:29.041 --> 23:30.833
Oh. He's a big boy. He'll be fine.

23:30.833 --> 23:33.666
Well...
...maybe I'm underselling this a bit.

23:33.666 --> 23:37.000
The monkey shot him in the face
and blew his head off.

23:37.000 --> 23:37.916
Seriously?

23:38.541 --> 23:40.041
Yes. I'm making my serious face.
