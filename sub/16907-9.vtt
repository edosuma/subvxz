WEBVTT

00:02.211 --> 00:03.588
Previously on Arrow...

00:03.754 --> 00:07.634
You're all this city has,
so stop being so hard on yourself.

00:08.634 --> 00:10.261
That notebook belonged to my father.

00:10.427 --> 00:12.646
I thought that it was my way
to save the city.

00:12.804 --> 00:14.306
We all want to believe
in Oliver's crusade,

00:14.473 --> 00:15.474
but I'm pissed that the guy

00:15.641 --> 00:17.860
who only shares the important information
with his inner circle

00:18.018 --> 00:19.270
used to be a serial killer.

00:19.436 --> 00:22.064
For a long time, I blamed you
for my parents dying.

00:22.231 --> 00:25.201
Knowing all this
doesn't make it any easier.

00:28.904 --> 00:32.158
Nobody followed me.
They don't suspect a thing.

00:52.427 --> 00:54.304
I brought what you asked for.

01:00.018 --> 01:01.486
Addresses are on the back.

01:08.902 --> 01:10.575
I took those last two myself.

01:18.829 --> 01:21.082
What, that's it? We had a deal.

01:21.498 --> 01:24.297
I get you the intel, I get to be there
when you take him down.

01:24.626 --> 01:27.220
You think
you can make demands of me?

01:27.671 --> 01:29.173
No.

01:29.881 --> 01:32.054
No, of course not. I know he's your kill,

01:34.219 --> 01:35.641
but I want to watch him die.

01:35.804 --> 01:40.355
You haven't been listening.
I'm not going to kill him.

01:45.856 --> 01:48.234
I'm gonna make him wish he was dead.

02:00.996 --> 02:03.624
This is incredible, Speedy.

02:03.790 --> 02:06.043
I can't believe you pulled it off,
especially after...

02:06.251 --> 02:10.097
Oh, I thought we decided
not to talk about aliens anymore?

02:10.297 --> 02:12.641
- Right.
- And besides, how can you be so surprised?

02:12.841 --> 02:14.935
I'm Moira Queen's daughter,
and that means

02:15.093 --> 02:17.346
throwing a killer Christmas party
is in my blood.

02:17.554 --> 02:19.227
Mom and Dad would be very
proud of you, Speedy.

02:19.389 --> 02:21.391
Me? Come on, you're the Mayor.

02:21.558 --> 02:23.731
They'd be so happy, they wouldn't know
what to do with themselves.

02:23.894 --> 02:26.738
Are you all right? Because,
what the Dominators showed us,

02:26.897 --> 02:29.320
it was a little like losing them
all over again.

02:29.483 --> 02:32.828
They didn't take anything away from me,
they gave me something.

02:32.986 --> 02:35.910
They reminded me how lucky I am
to be a part of this family

02:36.073 --> 02:38.326
and to have you as my brother.

02:38.492 --> 02:39.835
How sweet.

02:43.664 --> 02:45.587
- Sorry, I'm late.
- No, it's fine.

02:45.749 --> 02:48.343
I know, I know, I already broke
the first rule of being a good date

02:48.502 --> 02:51.381
by not arriving with you,
but I had a crushing deadline.

02:51.546 --> 02:53.048
Glamorous life of a journalist, right?

02:53.215 --> 02:54.512
The dress that you're wearing
makes up for it.

02:54.675 --> 02:56.643
<i>I...</i>

02:56.802 --> 02:59.100
You're his... His date?

02:59.596 --> 03:00.722
Yeah.

03:00.889 --> 03:02.436
Yeah, just... Just for this party.

03:02.599 --> 03:05.569
Which, by the way,
is a definite improvement

03:05.727 --> 03:08.731
over the previous Mayor's holiday bash.
Nicely done.

03:08.897 --> 03:10.740
Thanks. It's really great to know

03:10.941 --> 03:13.990
that this administration can do,
like, one thing right.

03:14.236 --> 03:15.283
- Be nice, Thea.
- No,

03:15.445 --> 03:17.789
I'm gonna go get a drink now,
talk to you later.

03:19.741 --> 03:23.041
She's... I mean,
she's just being protective.

03:23.328 --> 03:26.081
Mmm. To be fair,
I didn't make the best first impression.

03:26.289 --> 03:28.758
Well, I of all people understand
that sometimes doing your job

03:28.959 --> 03:30.006
means pissing people off.

03:31.044 --> 03:32.466
It just means that you're doing it well.

03:32.796 --> 03:34.844
I see you've reclaimed your optimism.

03:35.006 --> 03:36.349
Oh, thanks to you.

03:37.634 --> 03:38.806
Cheers.

03:47.018 --> 03:49.567
- Is that your second champagne?
- Third.

03:49.730 --> 03:52.483
Are you really that nervous
to finally introduce me to your friends?

03:52.649 --> 03:56.153
I just want them to love you
as much as I I...

03:56.820 --> 03:59.073
...like you.

04:01.783 --> 04:03.251
These are my friends.

04:03.577 --> 04:05.250
Guys, this is my Malone boyfriend.

04:05.495 --> 04:09.090
This is Billy Malone,
my boy... Boyfriend

04:12.377 --> 04:14.004
I'm Curtis, by the way,

04:14.171 --> 04:16.673
the guy awkwardly standing in front of you
waiting to be introduced.

04:16.839 --> 04:18.934
- And this is my husband, Paul.
- Curtis is my best friend at work.

04:19.091 --> 04:21.595
Well, was, until I was fired
from my own company. Cheers.

04:21.762 --> 04:23.605
I thought you guys were working
on a startup together?

04:23.847 --> 04:25.565
The one he's been putting
all the late nights in on?

04:25.724 --> 04:27.943
The very late nights at the startup, yes!
We, it's just...

04:28.101 --> 04:30.320
The startup is so fun, I mean,
we barely call it work,

04:30.520 --> 04:31.521
because it's just like...

04:31.688 --> 04:33.065
<i>Whoo-hoo!</i>

04:33.315 --> 04:35.192
So much fun.

04:42.491 --> 04:43.868
Who needs a fancy party at City Hall

04:44.034 --> 04:46.628
when all the most important people
are right here?

04:47.913 --> 04:50.541
Oh, shucks, John,
you're gonna make us all blush.

04:50.832 --> 04:52.755
Do you think it's a fire hazard
to light the menorah in here?

04:53.001 --> 04:54.048
I think the only hazard's gonna be

04:54.211 --> 04:57.090
if you mess with that table setting
before Lyla gets back with the turkey.

04:58.965 --> 05:00.057
Oh.

05:00.592 --> 05:01.844
- What do you think?
- Nice.

05:02.010 --> 05:04.012
- Cute kid.
- Yeah, he gets it from his mom.

05:04.179 --> 05:05.305
I figured.

05:07.349 --> 05:10.649
Must be weird
finding out about Flashpoint.

05:10.811 --> 05:12.734
Yeah, I'm still not sure
how I feel about that, man.

05:12.896 --> 05:14.990
I should be used to all the unusual things
around here,

05:15.148 --> 05:16.149
especially after last week, but,

05:18.777 --> 05:20.620
I could never imagine a daughter.

05:20.779 --> 05:22.247
Cool car!

05:23.824 --> 05:25.872
Being a father's
the best thing in the world,

05:26.618 --> 05:27.915
especially around the holidays.

05:28.119 --> 05:29.917
Sounds like you know something
about kids, you got any?

05:30.705 --> 05:33.834
Sorry, I'm late, but I come bearing gifts.

05:34.501 --> 05:37.004
We had this tradition in my family
where we all open our presents

05:37.170 --> 05:38.888
at the exact same time.

05:39.047 --> 05:42.267
Since you guys are the only family I have,
I figured I'd try it with you.

05:42.425 --> 05:43.597
Thanks.

05:46.721 --> 05:48.394
Were you even listening to the rules?

05:48.557 --> 05:51.356
I don't like rules, or listening.

05:54.354 --> 05:55.571
This is dope, Evie!

05:56.147 --> 05:57.273
Wow.

05:58.024 --> 05:59.367
Thanks, Evelyn, it's very sweet.

05:59.526 --> 06:00.527
You're welcome.

06:00.694 --> 06:03.072
You know, the best part is,
this is gonna piss Oliver off

06:03.238 --> 06:06.117
when we hang these up all over the place.

06:06.283 --> 06:09.036
<i>Happy Holidays, everyone.
Thank you so much for coming.</i>

06:09.619 --> 06:12.623
My favorite Christmas movie is Die <i>Hard.</i>

06:14.624 --> 06:19.004
It's true. My second favorite
Christmas movie is It's a Wonderful Life.

06:19.546 --> 06:24.848
And I was very lucky to be able to
rewatch that movie last week.

06:26.386 --> 06:28.980
It reminded me how much work
I still have to do,

06:29.139 --> 06:31.483
how much work all of us still have to do,

06:31.641 --> 06:34.645
and it inspired me to recommit myself

06:35.562 --> 06:38.611
to making our city, our home,

06:38.899 --> 06:41.743
a better and safer place. Cheers.

06:46.281 --> 06:47.749
Great speech.

06:47.991 --> 06:49.117
Uh...

06:49.492 --> 06:51.665
What she said.

06:52.454 --> 06:54.252
Uh, Felicity, right?

06:54.414 --> 06:56.382
Yeah, you must be the super-hot reporter.

06:56.666 --> 06:58.043
Um, Thank you.

06:58.251 --> 07:00.845
What I meant to say was, this is my,
this is my boyfriend, Billy.

07:01.254 --> 07:02.597
It's nice to see you again, Mayor Queen.

07:02.839 --> 07:04.136
Billy, please call me Oliver.

07:06.009 --> 07:08.888
Hey, um, we're actually gonna head out.

07:09.179 --> 07:10.852
- Everything all right?
- It will be.

07:12.098 --> 07:13.475
L think.

07:17.479 --> 07:20.699
So, you guys want to go on a double date
some time, or...

07:20.899 --> 07:23.277
<i>No. Cook</i>

07:28.698 --> 07:31.918
Paul! Paul, come on!

07:32.285 --> 07:34.629
Tell me the truth. All those nights
you said you were with Felicity,

07:34.788 --> 07:36.381
- what have you been doing?
- Nothing.

07:36.581 --> 07:38.675
- Are you seeing someone?
- Baby, of course not!

07:38.875 --> 07:40.969
- I don't believe you.
- Let me explain.

07:50.637 --> 07:51.854
Curtis!

07:54.474 --> 07:56.272
Get out of here, run!

08:03.108 --> 08:04.951
- No!

08:09.864 --> 08:12.162
Do what you want to me,
just leave him alone.

08:20.291 --> 08:21.759
No!

08:26.589 --> 08:29.433
Help! Somebody help us!

08:29.718 --> 08:31.391
Please! Help!

08:38.977 --> 08:40.854
- Hey.
- How you feeling?

08:41.229 --> 08:44.107
Like someone threw a throwing star at me,

08:44.441 --> 08:47.615
kicked me down a flight of steps,
and knocked me out.

08:49.779 --> 08:51.622
The doctor said you're not
supposed to sit up.

08:51.781 --> 08:55.126
Yeah, well, the doctor
doesn't know me that well.

08:55.785 --> 08:57.332
Not sure I do anymore, either.

08:58.163 --> 08:59.255
I can explain everything.

08:59.414 --> 09:02.384
Great. Let's start with
where you learned to fight like that.

09:02.625 --> 09:06.300
Fight like what? In case you
hadn't noticed, I lost. Badly.

09:06.463 --> 09:08.431
You think I don't know who
that was, Curtis?

09:09.257 --> 09:12.101
That was the Throwing Star Killer.
He's murdered people.

09:12.260 --> 09:15.810
And yet somehow, you're still alive.
How is that even possible?

09:15.972 --> 09:17.815
Oh, my God, Curtis, are you all right?

09:17.974 --> 09:20.068
I'm great. Just a little banged up,

09:20.226 --> 09:22.979
like I always am when I get into
street fights with muggers.

09:23.146 --> 09:25.319
It wasn't a mugger,
it was a serial killer,

09:25.482 --> 09:26.825
the Throwing Star Killer.

09:28.026 --> 09:30.028
I thought you had the Anti-Crime Unit
taking care of this.

09:30.195 --> 09:34.075
We do, Paul, and-and we're working
very hard to catch him. I promise.

09:34.240 --> 09:35.617
<i>Actually, your statement
could really help.</i>

09:35.784 --> 09:37.036
Detective Malone is just outside,

09:37.202 --> 09:38.954
if you'd feel comfortable answering
a few questions?

09:40.955 --> 09:42.081
It's all right, Paul.

09:47.670 --> 09:48.671
Prometheus.

09:48.838 --> 09:52.593
He attacked me, as well "me."

09:52.759 --> 09:54.056
So he knows you're Mr. Terrific.

09:54.219 --> 09:56.517
Yeah. Which means he probably knows...

09:56.679 --> 09:58.431
He knows that I'm the Green Arrow.

10:02.310 --> 10:05.154
If you remember anything else
that could help us, give me a call.

10:05.313 --> 10:06.314
My cell's on there, too.

10:06.523 --> 10:07.524
Thank you, Detective.

10:12.487 --> 10:14.239
I can't believe that this is happening.

10:14.447 --> 10:15.448
Can't you?

10:15.615 --> 10:18.209
You think I haven't figured out
that the tall guy in the black mask

10:18.368 --> 10:19.870
rolling with the Green Arrow is Curtis?

10:20.078 --> 10:21.295
Promise me you didn't tell Paul.

10:21.454 --> 10:24.003
No, but right now,
I'm more worried about you.

10:24.207 --> 10:26.426
If Prometheus is targeting the people
working with the Green Arrow...

10:26.626 --> 10:27.627
I'll be fine.

10:27.794 --> 10:29.546
And I'll feel better if you're
staying at my place

10:29.754 --> 10:32.177
at least until we track down Prometheus.

10:32.382 --> 10:34.305
- We?
- It's my job, Felicity.

10:34.676 --> 10:36.349
If there's a killer out there,
I'm gonna stop him,

10:36.553 --> 10:38.897
especially if he's a threat
to someone I care about.

10:39.180 --> 10:41.182
Billy. Billy!

10:47.856 --> 10:48.857
Everything all right?

10:49.023 --> 10:52.573
No. The doctor was speaking with Curtis,
he's gonna be fine,

10:52.735 --> 10:54.737
but they found a drug in his system
called Dycloserol.

10:54.904 --> 10:56.747
No, never heard of it.

10:57.574 --> 10:58.996
But you have, what is it?

11:03.830 --> 11:05.753
Well, it's gonna take some adjusting,

11:06.708 --> 11:09.257
not trying to catch you
giving me the slip.

11:09.419 --> 11:11.717
I grabbed some Big Belly on the way in,
hope you're hungry.

11:11.880 --> 11:14.759
I lost my appetite. Come look at this.

11:17.427 --> 11:19.771
<i>TB outbreak in Lamb Valley?
Since when?</i>

11:19.929 --> 11:21.772
Since this guy got greedy.

11:21.931 --> 11:23.274
<i>That's one smug-looking
son of</i> a <i>bitch.</i>

11:23.433 --> 11:25.527
Justin Claybourne owns
Claybourne Pharmaceuticals

11:25.685 --> 11:29.656
that recently acquired the rights
to this drug, Dycloserol,

11:29.981 --> 11:32.279
which fights this particular strain of TB.

11:32.442 --> 11:33.944
Let me guess,
as soon as the outbreak started,

11:34.110 --> 11:35.111
he jacked up the prices.

11:35.278 --> 11:37.451
Price went from $10 a pill
to $1,000 overnight.

11:37.655 --> 11:40.078
The people of Lamb Valley,
they're working class,

11:40.241 --> 11:41.743
low income, they can't afford this.

11:41.910 --> 11:43.162
It's disgusting, but not illegal.

11:43.620 --> 11:47.375
Claybourne is on the list.
I'm not worried about illegal.

11:47.540 --> 11:49.793
Just because your father
wrote down his name?

11:49.959 --> 11:53.429
My father explained this list.
These are terrible people.

11:53.630 --> 11:54.722
How would you know that?
I thought he was dead.

11:54.964 --> 11:57.763
I am gonna make sure that Claybourne
stops gouging people.

11:57.926 --> 11:59.303
And what if he refuses to cooperate?

11:59.469 --> 12:01.437
You ask that like he has a choice.

12:08.853 --> 12:12.073
<i>After what seems like a respite
from the serial murders weeks ago,</i>

12:12.232 --> 12:14.360
<i>the Throwing Star Killer strikes again.</i>

12:14.525 --> 12:16.869
<i>Another attack by the Throwing Star Killer</i>

12:17.028 --> 12:19.497
<i>disrupted the annual holiday party
at City Hall.</i>

12:20.406 --> 12:23.000
Maybe we should change
the security codes on the bunker.

12:23.493 --> 12:25.495
Yeah, we did that over an hour ago.

12:25.870 --> 12:27.087
All the good that'll do.

12:27.247 --> 12:28.294
Rene's right.

12:28.456 --> 12:30.208
And you know
how much she hates saying that.

12:30.375 --> 12:32.878
If Prometheus knows who Curtis is,
he knows who we all are.

12:33.044 --> 12:35.513
Maybe Barry could do that
Flashpoint thing again?

12:35.672 --> 12:38.221
Yeah, he does that,
Digg might end up with five kids.

12:38.508 --> 12:39.930
Stuff makes my brain hurt.

12:40.093 --> 12:41.219
How's Curtis?

12:41.386 --> 12:42.387
He's gonna be fine.

12:42.553 --> 12:44.476
Better, now that
the Dycloserol's out of his system.

12:44.639 --> 12:46.641
Prometheus injected him with it
when he attacked him.

12:46.808 --> 12:48.810
Dycloserol. Now, why does that
ring a bell?

12:48.977 --> 12:52.527
Because four years ago,
The Hood took down Justin Claybourne,

12:52.689 --> 12:55.533
the CEO of the pharmaceutical company
that manufactures it.

12:55.692 --> 12:57.114
And by took him down, you mean killed.

12:57.277 --> 12:58.278
- Right?
- Yeah.

12:58.444 --> 13:00.242
<i>After Claybourne's death,
his company went down,</i>

13:00.405 --> 13:02.328
he had no other family members
to leave it to.

13:02.490 --> 13:05.289
Still, Prometheus using Dycloserol
four years after the fact

13:05.451 --> 13:06.452
can't be a coincidence.

13:06.619 --> 13:08.542
- It does send a message.
- What message?

13:08.871 --> 13:10.873
I'm alive and I'm coming after you.

13:11.040 --> 13:12.758
You think Prometheus is Justin Claybourne?

13:13.001 --> 13:14.048
How's that possible?

13:14.210 --> 13:16.588
Well, in our town, people who are dead
turn out to be secretly alive

13:16.754 --> 13:17.755
almost every Wednesday.

13:17.922 --> 13:19.890
Case in point, the old Claybourne
manufacturing plant

13:20.049 --> 13:22.427
reports heavy usage of water and power
over the last few months.

13:22.593 --> 13:23.936
Doesn't mean it's Claybourne.

13:24.095 --> 13:26.814
Worth checking out. Suit up.

13:35.273 --> 13:37.025
- We're in.
- Copy.

13:42.030 --> 13:43.907
Ragman, are you in position?

13:44.073 --> 13:46.747
If he's in there, he's not getting out.

13:46.909 --> 13:49.287
Nobody makes a move
until I give the order.

13:49.454 --> 13:50.831
<i>Got it.</i>

13:51.539 --> 13:53.257
Hey, he said don't make a move.

13:53.416 --> 13:55.464
Yeah, but he knows I never listen to him.

14:02.216 --> 14:03.263
<i>That could be something.</i>

14:03.634 --> 14:05.136
You keep moving, I'll check it out.

14:07.263 --> 14:09.015
- Overwatch.
- Already on it.

14:09.307 --> 14:10.934
<i>Tracking the transmission
from the sensors now.</i>

14:13.603 --> 14:15.981
- That was fast.
- No, that was impossible.

14:16.230 --> 14:17.231
He's letting me in.

14:17.398 --> 14:18.775
<i>No, you need to pull back, it's not safe.</i>

14:20.109 --> 14:23.079
Five years and he still doesn't listen.

14:47.637 --> 14:52.143
Justin Claybourne,
you have failed this city.

14:52.308 --> 14:54.982
Not as badly as you have, Mr. Queen.

15:08.658 --> 15:10.080
Spartan, go upstairs,
Green Arrow needs your help.

15:10.243 --> 15:13.247
Me and Artemis are on the stairwell,
we can get there faster.

15:13.538 --> 15:15.336
You ready for a rematch with this bitch?

15:15.665 --> 15:18.339
More than. Prometheus doesn't scare me.

15:52.034 --> 15:54.708
I've been waiting four years for this.

15:57.707 --> 15:59.300
Let him go, you son of a bitch.

16:01.043 --> 16:02.340
What the...

16:06.048 --> 16:07.721
Evelyn?

16:09.594 --> 16:11.642
- Why?
- Because you're not a hero,

16:12.722 --> 16:13.894
you're a fraud.

16:14.223 --> 16:17.397
This city needs to be saved from you.

16:28.696 --> 16:30.414
Where's Prometheus?

16:31.574 --> 16:34.248
He's gone with Evelyn.

16:34.410 --> 16:35.832
He took her?

16:36.204 --> 16:37.751
He's working with her.

16:43.586 --> 16:45.634
- Stuff from the plant.
- Can you put it over there?

16:48.007 --> 16:49.805
- Where's Oliver?
- He's with Thea, helping her pack.

16:50.051 --> 16:51.098
He wants her to stay here.

16:51.260 --> 16:53.433
Lyla and J.J.
are at a A.R.G.U.S. safe house.

16:53.596 --> 16:55.644
Give me the names and socials
of the people you care about,

16:55.806 --> 16:57.274
I'll make sure they get to the safehouse.

16:57.683 --> 17:01.153
Wait. What other secret information could
Evelyn have told Prometheus about us?

17:01.312 --> 17:03.565
We've got to assume everything.
No one is safe.

17:03.731 --> 17:06.530
This is on me. I should've done
a better job at vetting her.

17:06.692 --> 17:07.693
This wasn't your fault.

17:07.859 --> 17:10.409
Seriously. No one
could've seen this coming.

17:10.613 --> 17:12.035
We don't have time
to play the blame game.

17:12.198 --> 17:13.199
We have to find Claybourne.

17:13.366 --> 17:15.460
We were hoping there was
something here that could help.

17:15.617 --> 17:18.087
- Like ashes?
- Those look like crematorium ashes.

17:18.246 --> 17:20.044
Question is, whose?

17:22.083 --> 17:24.461
Right. Well, I got to go, so you guys need
to run a DNA test

17:24.627 --> 17:26.846
on these ashes and bone fragments,

17:27.003 --> 17:30.725
find out who this person was and why
Prometheus is keeping their remains.

17:30.883 --> 17:32.305
You guys know how to run
a DNA sequencer, right?

17:32.468 --> 17:34.971
No, of course you don't.
Look, who I'm talking to.

17:35.137 --> 17:36.764
Just put some of the bone fragments
onto the slide,

17:36.931 --> 17:38.808
put it in the slot, and the machine
will do the rest. Got it?

17:38.975 --> 17:40.318
Uh, sure.

17:40.476 --> 17:41.693
I'll be back.

17:47.608 --> 17:48.825
Did you get all that?

17:49.443 --> 17:50.820
You're the smart one, remember?

17:56.200 --> 18:00.080
Hey. I thought you were gonna
let the Green Arrow handle this.

18:00.663 --> 18:02.836
No, I'm pretty sure my exact words were,

18:02.999 --> 18:04.967
"If there's a killer out there,
I'm gonna stop him."

18:05.126 --> 18:07.504
Yeah, I was just hoping
that was boyfriend posturing.

18:08.212 --> 18:12.092
I cross-referenced Curtis'
medical records with old SCPD case files.

18:12.258 --> 18:14.761
Prometheus injected him with Dycloserol,

18:14.927 --> 18:17.646
- which was manufactured at the Clay...
- Claybourne Pharmaceuticals

18:17.805 --> 18:19.853
and their plant just came online.

18:20.433 --> 18:22.106
Yeah, I know.

18:24.186 --> 18:26.029
How did you know?

18:27.189 --> 18:29.988
Because the Green Arrow hit it already.

18:30.610 --> 18:32.408
And we already got everything
that there is to get there.

18:32.570 --> 18:33.571
Why didn't you tell me?

18:33.738 --> 18:35.957
Remember that part about me
not wanting you to work on this case?

18:36.198 --> 18:38.496
Yeah, I'm a cop, Felicity, this is my job.

18:38.659 --> 18:42.835
Yeah, and Prometheus' job is killing cops,
so you need to stay away.

18:42.997 --> 18:45.091
Hey, if you're not gonna do it
for yourself,

18:45.291 --> 18:46.383
can you do it for me?

18:47.376 --> 18:48.798
I'm not letting this go.

18:48.961 --> 18:51.089
Felicity, you know how I feel about you,

18:51.714 --> 18:53.842
but I have to be true to who I am.

19:00.181 --> 19:01.774
I can't believe it.

19:01.932 --> 19:03.559
Evelyn was playing us this whole time?

19:03.726 --> 19:04.727
<i>RORY". Not the whole time.</i>

19:04.894 --> 19:07.272
Rene thinks she went dark
after we all found out about The Hood.

19:07.438 --> 19:10.237
You know, I always thought she had
a sort of Children of the Corn vibe.

19:10.399 --> 19:12.652
<i>Anyway, I was just calling
to give you the heads-up.</i>

19:12.943 --> 19:13.944
Watch your back.

19:14.111 --> 19:15.658
Will do. Thanks, Rory.

19:17.073 --> 19:20.828
Hey, baby, what's going on?
Were you able to find me that ice cream?

19:20.993 --> 19:22.119
- Who's Rory?
- Oh...

19:22.370 --> 19:25.874
Oh, Rory. He's a friend of mine
from my Palmer Tech days.

19:26.040 --> 19:29.169
He saw what happened on the news
and was just checking in on me.

19:29.335 --> 19:31.178
You're the world's worst liar, Curtis.

19:31.754 --> 19:33.097
It's one of the reasons I married you.

19:33.255 --> 19:34.381
What're you talking about?

19:34.548 --> 19:36.221
You know exactly what I'm talking about.

19:37.301 --> 19:40.555
The late nights out, canceled dinners,

19:40.721 --> 19:42.644
the inexplicable accidents.

19:43.599 --> 19:44.942
I can't do this anymore.

19:47.645 --> 19:50.068
You have to tell me what's going on.

19:50.272 --> 19:52.616
How do I put this?

19:56.779 --> 19:58.201
I work with the Green Arrow.

19:59.323 --> 20:02.372
You? You work with the Green Arrow?

20:02.660 --> 20:03.912
Yeah.

20:05.871 --> 20:07.669
- Come on.
- It's not impossible.

20:07.873 --> 20:10.217
You're helping the guy who is going around
putting arrows into people?

20:10.376 --> 20:12.879
Well, yeah, but only bad people,

20:13.045 --> 20:14.797
and only the ones who really
try to put up a fight.

20:14.964 --> 20:17.467
Most guys, we just try to send to jail.

20:17.675 --> 20:18.972
This is completely insane.

20:19.135 --> 20:20.432
Yes, I know that,

20:20.636 --> 20:22.855
but, you know, when you're out there
doing it, it's different.

20:23.472 --> 20:26.021
It feels amazing.

20:26.976 --> 20:28.523
Empowering.

20:29.812 --> 20:31.530
Almost a little inspiring.

20:32.648 --> 20:33.900
You lied to me.

20:35.025 --> 20:36.652
- For months.
- To keep you safe.

20:36.819 --> 20:39.493
To keep me safe? And what about you?

20:39.822 --> 20:41.995
You've been hurt how many times
since you started this?

20:42.158 --> 20:44.502
- Actually lost track.
- Which is why you need to stop.

20:44.660 --> 20:46.833
- Stop what?
- This, being a vigilante.

20:46.996 --> 20:48.122
I made a commitment.

20:48.289 --> 20:49.791
You made one to me, too.

20:50.124 --> 20:52.923
Last time I checked, our vows
didn't include me worrying every night

20:53.085 --> 20:56.555
about whether or not you were gonna
make it home alive the next morning.

21:00.134 --> 21:01.351
Paul...

21:02.178 --> 21:05.728
You can be a vigilante,
or you can be married to me,

21:06.682 --> 21:08.275
but you can't do both.

21:09.852 --> 21:11.399
I can't do both.

21:13.314 --> 21:14.907
Paul, wait...

21:20.613 --> 21:23.708
Think in Flashpoint, I maybe dated her
back in high school?

21:23.866 --> 21:26.540
It's an alternate timeline,
not an alternate reality.

21:26.702 --> 21:27.703
What's that supposed to mean?

21:27.870 --> 21:31.716
It means, and no offense,
but in a multiverse of possibilities,

21:31.874 --> 21:34.252
there's no world where Thea Queen
goes outwith...

21:34.418 --> 21:36.011
You know, someone like you.

21:36.170 --> 21:37.797
What's that supposed to mean,
"someone like me"?

21:37.963 --> 21:39.886
It means you're not my type.

21:40.049 --> 21:41.722
<i>- Any news?
- Nothing.</i>

21:42.009 --> 21:43.886
If Claybourne's out there,
he's not showing his face.

21:44.053 --> 21:47.057
Well, maybe his dead friend
will give us some information.

21:47.723 --> 21:49.225
- You get the sequencer working?
- I think?

21:49.433 --> 21:51.652
Oh, good work!
You got the sequencer working.

21:51.894 --> 21:55.273
Great. So whose ashes
was Claybourne keeping as a souvenir?

21:56.065 --> 21:57.408
Claybourne's.

21:59.276 --> 22:00.277
The ashes are his.

22:00.528 --> 22:04.533
So if Claybourne isn't Prometheus, who is?

22:12.915 --> 22:16.419
Thanks to the influx of cash
from our Dycloserol acquisition,

22:16.585 --> 22:20.089
our R & D pipeline's fully funded
for the next two years.

22:20.256 --> 22:23.180
These are exciting times, gentlemen,
and it's just the beginning.

22:38.023 --> 22:41.948
Justin Claybourne,
you have failed this city.

22:42.111 --> 22:46.617
I think you got the wrong guy, pal.
My company makes drugs that help people.

22:46.824 --> 22:48.576
Not the people in Lamb Valley.

22:48.742 --> 22:50.335
It's not my problem if some people
can't afford it.

22:50.494 --> 22:51.871
It is now.

22:54.415 --> 22:59.046
Your days of holding
this city's health hostage are over.

22:59.211 --> 23:00.428
Do you understand me?

23:00.588 --> 23:02.181
Okay, okay, yes!

23:04.425 --> 23:07.804
You have until 11:00 p.m. tomorrow
to make this right.

23:09.388 --> 23:11.186
And what happens if I don't?

23:15.102 --> 23:16.820
I'll aim higher.

23:30.659 --> 23:32.036
Jackpot

23:55.601 --> 23:58.024
SCPD! Show yourself!

24:22.962 --> 24:24.009
Cute baby.

24:24.171 --> 24:26.424
Cute, yeah, but why would your boyfriend
send this to you?

24:26.632 --> 24:29.135
That is what I'm trying to figure out.
That, and why men don't listen

24:29.301 --> 24:31.099
when you specifically tell them
not to do something.

24:31.261 --> 24:32.387
Why don't you guys listen?

24:32.554 --> 24:34.397
<i>Okay,
did you ask him why he sent it?</i>

24:34.556 --> 24:36.900
Yeah, texted him right back, no reply.
I'm kinda worried.

24:37.059 --> 24:39.187
Billy says he found it at
the Claybourne manufacturing plant?

24:39.353 --> 24:41.401
Yeah, according to the
GPS tag on his text.

24:41.563 --> 24:44.066
Why would he send this photo?
What's the relevance?

24:44.233 --> 24:45.234
<i>It's what's I'm trying to figure out.</i>

24:45.401 --> 24:48.450
Right after I try to figure out
why men don't listen.

24:48.612 --> 24:52.412
This is so strange. First human remains,
now baby pictures?

24:52.574 --> 24:54.576
Prometheus, he's...

24:54.743 --> 24:56.586
He's leaving a trail of breadcrumbs
for me to follow.

24:56.745 --> 24:59.123
- Try facial recognition?
- Facial recog isn't exactly baby friendly.

24:59.289 --> 25:02.088
Well, try it anyways,
it's kitchen sink time, and

25:02.251 --> 25:04.504
we don't listen because we're stubborn.

25:04.670 --> 25:06.843
Yeah, tell us something we don't know.

25:11.468 --> 25:14.062
Take it Claybourne wasn't impressed
with your Robin Hood act.

25:14.221 --> 25:16.895
No, he wasn't.
So I did some more digging.

25:17.057 --> 25:20.106
Claybourne didn't just price gouge
with his drug, he created the epidemic.

25:20.269 --> 25:22.943
He is connected to something called
the AK Desmond Group.

25:23.105 --> 25:24.948
They are black marketeers

25:25.107 --> 25:27.951
who specialize in creating bioweapons.

25:28.736 --> 25:30.989
What do you think they've
been working on?

25:32.531 --> 25:33.703
Weaponized tuberculosis.

25:33.866 --> 25:35.459
He created the marketplace, Diggle,

25:35.617 --> 25:37.790
and he didn't care
who died in the process.

25:39.455 --> 25:41.002
And now you're gonna kill him.

25:41.165 --> 25:43.509
How can you read what's in that folder
and have a problem with that?

25:43.667 --> 25:45.635
Have you thought about the ramifications
of your actions?

25:45.794 --> 25:47.467
Of actually crossing names off a list?

25:47.629 --> 25:49.381
Of being judge, jury, and executioner?

25:49.548 --> 25:51.801
Men like Claybourne buy judges,

25:52.051 --> 25:54.600
they buy juries.
The law doesn't apply to them.

25:54.762 --> 25:57.732
- I'm not saying you don't do some good!
- So what are you saying?

25:57.890 --> 25:59.813
What I'm saying is that
maybe one day, your actions

25:59.975 --> 26:02.774
might have some unintended consequences.

26:11.153 --> 26:12.450
Got your 911.

26:12.613 --> 26:15.082
911 might've been
understating things a bit.

26:15.240 --> 26:18.494
Detective Malone's been abducted.
ACU thinks by Prometheus.

26:18.660 --> 26:19.661
Why do they think that?

26:19.828 --> 26:21.830
He went out to track down a lead,
didn't come back.

26:21.997 --> 26:25.171
He's missed his last three call-ins,
GPS on his phone's been switched off.

26:25.334 --> 26:26.335
Do you think he's dead?

26:26.502 --> 26:29.381
I think that every cop
that's crossed paths with Prometheus is.

26:29.546 --> 26:32.095
Whether or not Billy's alive,
and believe me, I hope that he is,

26:32.257 --> 26:34.760
the ACU and the SCPD,
they need instructions.

26:34.927 --> 26:36.179
Well, we've had a BOLO out for weeks.

26:36.345 --> 26:39.440
I'm not talking about a Be-On-the-Lookout-
Order, I'm talking about a shoot-to-kill.

26:40.307 --> 26:41.980
I don't know
how that'll sit with the public.

26:42.142 --> 26:43.519
I do. They'll love it.

26:43.685 --> 26:46.359
You know why? Because they are as sick
and tired as I am

26:46.522 --> 26:49.651
of watching this psycho murder Star City's
finest and get away with it.

26:49.817 --> 26:51.535
Our cops need to know
that they can fight back,

26:51.693 --> 26:53.991
they don't have to take it easy
on this guy anymore.

26:54.154 --> 26:56.498
Okay, do it, but you pull in
every cop that you can find,

26:56.657 --> 26:58.204
you tell them holiday hours are revoked.

26:58.367 --> 26:59.584
Yeah.

27:07.876 --> 27:08.877
Talk to me.

27:09.044 --> 27:11.172
Facial recognition did kick back
something on the baby photo.

27:11.338 --> 27:13.306
Court records
related to Claybourne's divorce.

27:13.465 --> 27:15.217
The baby is Claybourne's son.

27:15.384 --> 27:16.931
You told me that Claybourne
didn't have any kids.

27:17.094 --> 27:18.892
Not of the legitimate variety.
But the divorce petition

27:19.054 --> 27:20.772
Claybourne's ex-wife filed says otherwise.

27:21.014 --> 27:22.561
There's no record
of the kid's name in the files,

27:22.724 --> 27:23.725
but due to the filing date,

27:23.892 --> 27:25.690
he'd be about 30 today.

27:25.894 --> 27:27.896
Just old enough to put on
a hood and a mask.

27:28.147 --> 27:32.448
Old enough to want revenge on the man
who murdered his father.

27:34.862 --> 27:36.239
Oliver, this isn't on you, man.

27:36.405 --> 27:37.577
Yes, it is.

27:38.907 --> 27:40.250
Yes, it is.

27:41.285 --> 27:44.334
You warned me, John. You warned me that
there would be unintended consequences

27:44.496 --> 27:45.998
and I didn't listen.

27:46.165 --> 27:49.169
Prometheus surprised me
at the plant with a move,

27:49.334 --> 27:51.086
a very specific, unique move.

27:54.047 --> 27:56.266
It was taught to me by a woman
that I met in Russia.

27:56.425 --> 27:58.302
You think you and Prometheus
had the same teacher?

27:58.468 --> 28:00.470
I think what he's saying is,
Prometheus had over four years

28:00.637 --> 28:01.980
to learn everything he does.

28:02.139 --> 28:03.311
Right.

28:05.851 --> 28:07.524
Felicity, Billy has gone missing.

28:07.686 --> 28:10.030
Chase thinks that it's Prometheus.
We alerted the police.

28:10.189 --> 28:12.442
We've ordered them to shoot
Prometheus on sight.

28:12.608 --> 28:14.952
Now, we are gonna find Billy,

28:15.110 --> 28:18.455
we are gonna bring him back to you,
I promise.

28:20.365 --> 28:22.117
Let's call Rory and Rene,
we're gonna hit the streets.

28:22.284 --> 28:24.457
If you learn anything, contact me.

28:24.620 --> 28:27.123
Do not engage this enemy
under any circumstances.

28:34.296 --> 28:36.469
I thought you weren't suiting up anymore.

28:36.632 --> 28:38.430
Yeah, well, it's Felicity's boyfriend.

28:38.592 --> 28:39.935
I figured, all hands.

28:40.093 --> 28:43.017
Plus, John told me about Claybourne,
and four years ago.

28:43.180 --> 28:46.150
Speedy, are you about to tell me,
after everything that's happened,

28:46.308 --> 28:49.812
and everything that's happening,
this isn't my fault?

28:50.145 --> 28:53.149
Do you remember when Tommy and I
went to the US Open?

28:53.315 --> 28:55.818
And you tried to land that helicopter
on the grounds

28:55.984 --> 28:59.238
'cause Tommy wanted to impress
Maria Sharapova and then

28:59.404 --> 29:01.372
made Dad blow that huge acquisitions deal?

29:01.531 --> 29:02.748
Because he had to bail me out, yeah.

29:02.908 --> 29:05.832
Pretty sure that was the most disappointed
he's ever been in you.

29:05.994 --> 29:07.667
I'm not seeing the relevance, Speedy.

29:07.829 --> 29:11.709
My point is, Dad wouldn't be disappointed
in who you've become.

29:11.875 --> 29:13.877
It's like you were saying
at that Christmas party,

29:14.044 --> 29:15.921
Mom and Dad would be proud.

29:16.171 --> 29:17.673
They might not be proud if they knew

29:17.881 --> 29:20.475
that I created something like Prometheus.

29:21.260 --> 29:23.854
There're two types of every legacy,

29:24.888 --> 29:27.016
two versions of what we leave behind.

29:27.516 --> 29:29.564
There's the good and then the bad.

29:30.310 --> 29:33.689
You just really have a lousy habit
of focusing only on the bad.

29:41.154 --> 29:42.997
Why are you not still in the hospital?

29:44.408 --> 29:46.001
Rory called me,

29:46.535 --> 29:48.287
told me what happened to Billy.

29:49.079 --> 29:50.581
There's no way I'm sitting this out.

29:50.747 --> 29:52.340
Wow, what did Paul have to say?

29:52.499 --> 29:54.877
Actually, he made it pretty easy.

29:55.669 --> 29:58.639
Give up the team or give up him.

29:59.089 --> 30:00.762
Well, he clearly
doesn't know you very well.

30:00.966 --> 30:01.967
What do you mean?

30:02.134 --> 30:04.307
Well, you don't really respond well
to ultimatums.

30:04.970 --> 30:06.392
He just doesn't get it.

30:06.847 --> 30:09.566
I have to do this no matter what.

30:10.726 --> 30:12.478
I have to be true to who I am.

30:18.400 --> 30:20.494
- A singing telegram? Okay.
- Mmm-hmm.

30:20.777 --> 30:22.950
My friend loves them and I thought
that I would surprise her.

30:23.113 --> 30:24.581
- Her?
- Just a friend.

30:24.740 --> 30:26.993
But I don't know
where her office buildings are.

30:27.159 --> 30:29.628
She works at the AK Desmond Group...

30:29.786 --> 30:32.505
AK Desmond Group. Hmm.

30:32.914 --> 30:35.087
They're not on the Internet,
like, at all, that's really weird.

30:35.250 --> 30:37.753
- Super weird.
- All right, well, lucky for you,

30:37.919 --> 30:39.091
there is the Internet

30:39.338 --> 30:41.261
And then there is the "lnternet."

30:41.423 --> 30:43.972
And these magic fingers can pull things
out of it, even Google can't find.

30:44.134 --> 30:46.853
Not that I believe in magic.

30:47.054 --> 30:50.479
Or, that I have magic fingers. I just,
I'm really good at, I'm... I can...

30:50.640 --> 30:52.642
Felicity? Please.

30:53.060 --> 30:54.437
Right. Uh...

30:57.272 --> 31:00.617
Mmm-hmm. 1852

31:01.234 --> 31:04.113
West Maple, 30th Floor.

31:04.446 --> 31:05.993
- Great.
- What? There you go. Just...

31:06.281 --> 31:08.909
It's... I meant to put it there,
just leave it there. It's...

31:09.076 --> 31:10.123
Thank you.

31:10.285 --> 31:11.958
You can just...

31:13.246 --> 31:14.463
Felicity.

31:18.543 --> 31:19.795
I do believe in magic.

31:24.132 --> 31:25.805
- 1852.
- What?

31:25.967 --> 31:29.517
1852. I just remembered something
I should've thought of a long time ago.

31:29.679 --> 31:31.306
Thought of what?

31:31.473 --> 31:33.521
- I think I know where Prometheus is.
- I'll call the team.

31:33.683 --> 31:36.732
No, I created this situation,
I am going to deal with it alone.

31:54.371 --> 31:55.839
Detective Malone.

32:28.905 --> 32:30.498
Kill that Robin Hood son of a bitch!

33:31.927 --> 33:35.272
You going to tell me again
I failed this city?

33:35.430 --> 33:38.650
You infected the people
in Lamb Valley to turn a profit.

33:38.808 --> 33:40.105
<i>You want to make this city great again?</i>

33:40.936 --> 33:42.529
This is how.

33:43.396 --> 33:45.114
With business, money.

33:45.273 --> 33:47.116
You are sentencing

33:47.275 --> 33:50.449
innocent families, children, to death.

33:50.612 --> 33:52.614
Nobody cares about those people.

33:52.781 --> 33:53.953
They're a blight.

33:55.242 --> 33:57.745
And I'm just thinning the herd.

33:57.911 --> 33:59.629
So am l.

34:10.966 --> 34:13.264
Did you hesitate at all
when you killed him?

34:13.426 --> 34:16.804
Or was he just another name
you crossed off your list?

34:16.972 --> 34:19.065
If you want revenge,

34:20.141 --> 34:21.768
I'm right here.

34:22.143 --> 34:26.148
This is about so much more than revenge.

34:49.170 --> 34:51.013
<i>I've studied you, Oliver Queen.</i>

34:51.339 --> 34:53.842
<i>I know everything.</i>

34:54.009 --> 34:57.138
<i>Who you love, who you trust,</i>

34:57.304 --> 34:59.227
<i>who you've hurt.</i>

34:59.389 --> 35:03.019
<i>Do you know how easy it was
to turn Evelyn against you?</i>

35:03.685 --> 35:07.189
<i>How easy it will be to turn them all?</i>

35:07.397 --> 35:11.447
<i>You're not a hero, you're a killer,</i>

35:11.610 --> 35:14.363
<i>and I'm going to show them that.</i>

35:14.571 --> 35:18.371
<i>I'm going to show them
how everything you touch dies.</i>

35:35.884 --> 35:40.936
<i>Four years I've waited,
to make you answer for your sins.</i>

35:50.565 --> 35:52.613
<i>I told you, Oliver,</i>

35:52.817 --> 35:55.616
<i>everything you touch dies.</i>

36:15.799 --> 36:17.597
What happened out there, man?

36:17.759 --> 36:19.761
Did you kill Prometheus?

36:21.388 --> 36:24.062
Billy. Did you find Billy?

36:27.102 --> 36:28.319
Oliver?

36:32.273 --> 36:35.948
Prometheus staged Billy.

36:36.778 --> 36:39.702
He duct-taped his mouth,
and he put a weapon in his hand,

36:39.864 --> 36:41.332
and he put him in his suit.

36:42.283 --> 36:43.330
Prometheus knew...

36:43.493 --> 36:44.961
- No, Oliver, don't.
- That I was there to kill him.

36:45.120 --> 36:47.339
- Don't!
- And he'd calculated every moment.

36:47.497 --> 36:49.420
Where is he?

36:50.458 --> 36:52.131
Where is Billy?

36:55.130 --> 36:57.383
L killed Billy.

36:59.426 --> 37:01.178
I'm so sorry, Felicity.

37:01.344 --> 37:03.847
I didn't know it was Billy,
I couldn't have known

37:04.013 --> 37:07.313
that it was him. I could...
I couldn't have known.

37:09.519 --> 37:11.237
Oh, my God.

37:14.691 --> 37:16.659
This was Prometheus.

37:17.360 --> 37:19.362
This was all him.

37:19.863 --> 37:22.958
He's trying to prove to me
that everyone, I...

37:23.116 --> 37:26.086
I come into contact with,
everyone close to me dies.

37:26.244 --> 37:29.498
<i>And he's right, he...</i>

37:32.083 --> 37:34.677
I think that, uh...

37:37.672 --> 37:39.674
I think that all of you
should get as far away from me

37:39.841 --> 37:41.093
as you possibly can.

37:52.312 --> 37:56.692
Oliver, we are exactly
where we're supposed to be.

38:06.534 --> 38:07.706
Okay.

38:08.203 --> 38:10.797
I know I picked the worst

38:10.955 --> 38:13.879
possible night to come home late again,

38:14.042 --> 38:15.965
but you have to believe me,

38:16.252 --> 38:20.507
this was a seriously terrible day.

38:23.885 --> 38:25.728
Which is not going to get any better.

38:26.054 --> 38:27.055
I'm going to my brother's house.

38:27.347 --> 38:30.396
Come on, baby, it's been less than
24 hours since your ultimatum.

38:30.558 --> 38:34.108
That's the thing, I never wanted to be
the guy that makes ultimatums.

38:34.896 --> 38:36.318
You know what's funny?

38:36.981 --> 38:39.780
You were coming home every night, late,

38:40.610 --> 38:41.987
banged up all to hell,

38:44.197 --> 38:45.744
and I've never seen you happier.

38:47.492 --> 38:49.540
I don't want to be the one
to take you away from that.

38:49.744 --> 38:51.087
You don't have to be.

38:51.371 --> 38:54.500
But I also can't live knowing that

38:54.791 --> 38:56.839
every time I see you might be the last.

38:58.628 --> 39:00.130
I love you too much.

39:01.089 --> 39:02.557
Paul, please.

39:02.924 --> 39:04.016
I'm sorry.

39:05.093 --> 39:06.970
Paul, please. Please.

39:22.861 --> 39:23.953
<i>- Hey.</i>
<i>- Johnny, I need you to come</i>

39:24.153 --> 39:25.200
<i>to the safe house.</i>

39:25.363 --> 39:26.364
<i>Something's wrong with J.J.</i>

39:26.531 --> 39:27.578
Lyla?

39:29.033 --> 39:30.626
Lyla?

39:33.830 --> 39:35.377
Oliver.

39:36.958 --> 39:38.380
What time is it?

39:38.668 --> 39:40.762
I'm sorry. I didn't know
where else to go.

39:40.920 --> 39:42.263
You want to talk about it?

39:42.755 --> 39:43.972
Not really.

39:44.132 --> 39:45.805
Come on. Come in.

39:52.307 --> 39:54.059
<i>Can I get you a drink?</i>

39:54.475 --> 39:55.647
I could use a drink.

40:01.149 --> 40:02.492
<i>Why'?</i>

40:03.276 --> 40:04.653
I thought things were getting better.

40:04.819 --> 40:07.288
So did I, but, um...

40:09.657 --> 40:11.500
That feeling never seems to last.

40:12.243 --> 40:13.540
Thank you.

40:16.122 --> 40:18.875
And, why do you think that is?

40:22.253 --> 40:25.678
I was reunited with someone
from my past recently.

40:26.841 --> 40:28.309
I knew their father.

40:30.303 --> 40:32.351
And they told me

40:32.680 --> 40:37.481
that I ruin the lives of everyone
that I come into contact with.

40:39.312 --> 40:41.314
<i>Doesn't matter who they are.</i>

40:42.398 --> 40:44.241
<i>Doesn't matter how much I love them.</i>

40:49.364 --> 40:50.866
<i>If I'm in their life,</i>

40:52.659 --> 40:54.127
<i>that life turns to ash.</i>

40:56.788 --> 40:58.335
I think that's ridiculous.

40:59.207 --> 41:02.177
Everyone's life touches everyone else's.

41:02.710 --> 41:05.759
Sometimes the result is good,
and sometimes it's bad,
