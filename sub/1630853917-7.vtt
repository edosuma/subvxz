WEBVTT

00:28.779 --> 00:30.030
Oh, no.
-Oh, come on.

00:35.077 --> 00:36.662
Is there someone else in that boat?

00:38.956 --> 00:39.915
Shit.

00:41.542 --> 00:43.627
That isn't your man from work, is it?

00:43.627 --> 00:45.671
Jesus Christ.
-There's someone in the water.

00:45.671 --> 00:47.881
Call an ambulance. Quick!
-Are you fucking kidding me?

00:47.965 --> 00:48.966
Oh, Gabriel.

00:51.468 --> 00:52.678
What is he doing?

00:53.929 --> 00:55.472
Trying to save a man's life.

00:56.640 --> 00:57.975
JP?

01:04.063 --> 01:05.691
Paramedics are seven minutes away.

01:10.237 --> 01:11.864
Fuck's sake.

01:11.864 --> 01:14.283
Oh, no. Is he breathing?
-I don't think so.

01:14.867 --> 01:16.368
He has no trousers on.

01:16.368 --> 01:18.412
That's not a big priority, David.

01:25.085 --> 01:26.044
Eva.

01:28.505 --> 01:30.465
Eva, we need to get out--
-Just wait, wait.

01:30.549 --> 01:32.885
Come on, you stubborn bastard.

01:35.804 --> 01:37.097
Oh, my God.

01:37.181 --> 01:39.141
Eva, we need to get out of here.
-Okay, okay.

01:40.017 --> 01:41.727
Hey.
-Fuck's sake.

03:11.900 --> 03:12.901
Hey, you.

03:17.072 --> 03:18.198
Wha--

03:19.241 --> 03:20.534
Are you in pain?

03:21.910 --> 03:24.079
John Paul. How are you feeling?

03:24.913 --> 03:27.082
Like I should be dead.

03:27.082 --> 03:28.458
Well, luckily you're not.

03:29.418 --> 03:32.379
But can you tell me anything
you remember from last night?

03:34.381 --> 03:35.632
From--

03:35.716 --> 03:37.801
How you got from your home to the marina?

03:38.927 --> 03:39.928
Marin--

03:41.138 --> 03:43.515
That's where the paramedics were called.

03:44.391 --> 03:45.809
You don't remember anything?

03:46.852 --> 03:47.853
No.

03:48.687 --> 03:51.565
That sometimes happens
when going through a traumatic experience.

03:53.400 --> 03:56.153
Are you under any extra stress
at the moment?

03:57.279 --> 03:58.906
Have you been feeling depressed?

04:00.991 --> 04:03.368
I'm not suicidal. If--

04:04.203 --> 04:07.039
Maybe you could speak to him
after he's rested some more?

04:10.459 --> 04:12.419
What if he saw us in the bedroom?

04:13.587 --> 04:17.007
Well, that would mean the police
could be on their way here right now.

04:17.089 --> 04:19.635
The police would already be here
if he saw us.

04:21.595 --> 04:24.181
You said Rohypnol causes blackouts, right?

04:24.181 --> 04:25.641
We'll be fine.

04:26.225 --> 04:27.684
What if he gets his memory back?

04:28.310 --> 04:31.146
Could that happen?
-Yeah.

04:34.441 --> 04:36.318
This is all your gay boyfriend's fault.

04:36.318 --> 04:40.197
Oh, yeah. What a wanker.
Saved a drowning man's life.

04:43.283 --> 04:45.369
Do you have something
more important to do?

04:45.369 --> 04:46.620
I have to go to work.

04:51.333 --> 04:52.334
It's Grace.

04:56.463 --> 04:59.383
Hey, honey, we're all here at Ursula's.

04:59.383 --> 05:02.511
<i>Hey. He's okay. Physically, he's okay.</i>

05:03.595 --> 05:04.972
But mentally, he's wrecked.

05:05.597 --> 05:09.977
He said-- He thinks...

05:11.436 --> 05:13.397
<i>He thinks someone's trying to kill him.</i>

05:14.273 --> 05:15.274
Shit.

05:15.274 --> 05:16.441
That's insane.

05:16.525 --> 05:18.735
How? Why?

05:18.819 --> 05:21.154
Did he see anything?

05:25.951 --> 05:29.204
Grace, just take a breath and--

05:29.288 --> 05:31.665
He says it's the only explanation, is--

05:31.665 --> 05:34.668
Someone drugged him
and threw him into the marina

05:34.668 --> 05:36.753
<i>and left him for dead.</i>
-Shit.

05:37.880 --> 05:39.882
Where's the nasal spray?

05:39.882 --> 05:42.176
I-- You--

05:43.177 --> 05:46.096
Well, did he say who?

05:46.638 --> 05:48.348
<i>What are you talking about? Nobody.</i>

05:48.432 --> 05:51.018
He must've banged his head
falling into the water.

05:52.144 --> 05:54.146
Yes. Yeah. Yes.

05:54.146 --> 05:57.316
That's-- Yeah. And look, Blanaid is fine.
-I can't find it.

05:57.316 --> 05:59.151
She's here with us,
so don't worry about her.

05:59.151 --> 06:01.445
Thank you.
-<i>And don't worry about him either.</i>

06:01.445 --> 06:04.448
You know, he'll be fine.
Jesus, the stress he puts you under.

06:04.448 --> 06:06.241
It never fucking ends!
-Call us--

06:07.409 --> 06:09.786
Grace, if you need anything
you just call us, okay?

06:09.870 --> 06:12.831
<i>We're here for you. Okay. Love you.</i>

06:18.128 --> 06:19.421
I love you too.

06:26.178 --> 06:28.305
No one is gonna believe him, okay?

06:28.305 --> 06:32.351
If he says any of that crap.
They're gonna think he's lost the plot.

06:33.894 --> 06:35.479
We can't find the nasal spray.

06:39.691 --> 06:41.860
Well, you've gotta sort that out.

06:42.486 --> 06:44.947
I mean, this is your responsibility.
-Since when?

06:44.947 --> 06:46.949
You bring the drugs in. You take them out.

06:46.949 --> 06:48.909
I gave it to you.
-No, you didn't.

06:48.909 --> 06:49.993
Didn't I?

06:53.247 --> 06:54.623
Then it must be at the house.

06:55.457 --> 06:58.293
Well, I can't--
I've got a job interview, okay? I--

07:00.629 --> 07:02.005
I have one eye.

07:04.716 --> 07:06.885
Fine. I'll take Blanaid back.

07:06.969 --> 07:09.096
I'll grab the damn thing
and get rid, okay?

07:14.476 --> 07:18.230
Oh, shit. Bloody...

07:22.860 --> 07:24.945
Those messages you left last night.

07:24.945 --> 07:27.906
"Who knows what I'll do."
That's what you said.

07:27.990 --> 07:30.284
But that was about the netball tournament.

07:31.159 --> 07:32.327
I didn't want you to go.

07:32.411 --> 07:34.788
So you jump into the sea
in the middle of the night?

07:34.872 --> 07:36.331
Can you see how that terrifies me?

07:36.415 --> 07:39.543
Grace, can we please talk about this
at home?

07:39.543 --> 07:41.712
Please. I just want to go home.

07:42.838 --> 07:44.256
I don't know, John Paul.

07:44.256 --> 07:46.550
Please, Gracie.

07:49.094 --> 07:50.095
Please.

07:52.848 --> 07:53.849
Okay.

07:55.017 --> 07:57.728
But we have to make an appointment
with the psychologist before we leave.

07:57.728 --> 08:00.189
All right. Okay. Thank you.

08:01.523 --> 08:02.524
Blanaid's at Ursula's,

08:02.608 --> 08:05.527
so we'll have the place to ourselves,
so we can really talk.

08:06.737 --> 08:07.738
Okay.

08:09.072 --> 08:11.992
Did you bring me some clothes?

08:12.576 --> 08:13.577
Yeah.

08:18.040 --> 08:19.166
Excuse me.

08:24.004 --> 08:25.047
What?

08:37.726 --> 08:39.852
They had the sleeping pills,
but unfortunate--

08:39.937 --> 08:41.438
What are you doing?

08:41.522 --> 08:42.856
I'm going to my interview.

08:43.440 --> 08:46.109
No.
Gerald will understand if you postpone.

08:46.193 --> 08:48.111
I'm not postponing. I'll look bad.

08:48.195 --> 08:51.031
That's the last thing I want,
but-- Just say you're sick.

08:51.031 --> 08:55.077
Jesus Christ. I can't say I'm sick
'cause I'm not sick.

08:55.077 --> 08:56.787
Someone tried to kill me.

08:58.163 --> 08:59.581
You're distressed. You're upset.

08:59.665 --> 09:03.877
Mammy, I'll be much more distressed
and upset if I don't get this promotion.

09:03.961 --> 09:06.922
This is for us. For our family.
It's for our future.

09:06.922 --> 09:09.675
And I deserve it.

09:09.675 --> 09:11.218
You're not thinking straight!

09:14.054 --> 09:16.139
You need some time off.
You need to slow down.

09:16.223 --> 09:17.391
I'll see you back home.

09:19.685 --> 09:20.686
John Paul.

09:33.407 --> 09:35.325
I have to go.
-No.

09:36.285 --> 09:38.203
No, don't go. Come on.

09:41.748 --> 09:43.333
I can't be late today.

09:43.417 --> 09:45.544
Why? You got more innocent families
to stitch up?

09:47.588 --> 09:48.589
Sorry.

09:49.339 --> 09:50.674
It's my dad's birthday.

09:52.426 --> 09:53.677
Well, it would've been.

09:56.013 --> 09:57.681
I'm meeting Thomas at the grave.

10:01.810 --> 10:02.811
Come here.

10:07.399 --> 10:08.567
Christ.

10:08.567 --> 10:11.111
You looking for my soft tissue?
-Sorry.

10:11.195 --> 10:12.196
Years of shiatsu.

10:12.196 --> 10:14.031
My grip's stronger than I think.

10:20.078 --> 10:26.001
It seems weird to me, marking his birthday
now that I know what actually happened.

10:27.586 --> 10:30.255
Well, you're celebrating his life,
not his death.

10:34.343 --> 10:35.761
We could do something later.

10:35.761 --> 10:38.805
Something a little bit less depressing
than a cemetery trip.

10:39.306 --> 10:40.307
Like what?

10:43.519 --> 10:46.396
Where would you wanna be
if you could be anywhere in the world?

10:47.481 --> 10:48.565
In Tijuana.

10:49.066 --> 10:51.818
"In your arms, Becka"
was the right answer.

10:52.694 --> 10:54.571
In your arms in Tijuana, Becka.

10:55.239 --> 10:56.907
How about in your arms in Casablanca's

10:56.907 --> 10:59.826
'cause that's on Dolman Street,
and we get there in a cab for a fiver.

11:00.369 --> 11:03.914
I'd be as happy in your arms
in your flat with a curry.

11:03.914 --> 11:04.998
Deal.

11:09.086 --> 11:10.087
Bye.

11:11.171 --> 11:12.339
Matt.
-Yeah?

11:13.924 --> 11:15.509
Your brother lost his dad too.

11:39.908 --> 11:42.077
Don't know how he ever drank that stuff.

11:42.703 --> 11:44.663
Straight from the can, I think.

11:46.123 --> 11:47.499
Thought you might not come.

11:48.292 --> 11:49.293
Yeah, well...

11:55.048 --> 11:57.342
Theresa went the whole night
without kicking me.

11:57.926 --> 12:00.012
It's usually like sharing a bed
with an Ultimate Fighting champion--

12:00.012 --> 12:02.389
I still don't understand
why you didn't tell me, Tom.

12:04.933 --> 12:09.646
At the time, I didn't consider
an alternative to not telling you.

12:09.730 --> 12:11.982
I thought if you knew,
you'd be complicit too.

12:11.982 --> 12:13.275
Dad didn't want that.

12:15.068 --> 12:16.236
But I'm sorry.

12:20.824 --> 12:22.034
Here. Go on.

12:47.309 --> 12:51.230
You ever wondered if
you could've done something to stop him?

12:52.689 --> 12:53.690
Me?

12:54.191 --> 12:57.194
Well, you worked with him,
grew up with him...

12:58.487 --> 13:02.157
Pretty sure I didn't imagine you farting
in the bottom bunker every other weekend.

13:04.284 --> 13:07.079
Exactly. Every other weekend.

13:08.288 --> 13:09.665
Sometimes less is more.

13:09.665 --> 13:13.418
You get half the grief, half the hassle,
half the picking up the pieces.

13:14.795 --> 13:17.047
I feel like you're angry
that he was kind to me.

13:17.047 --> 13:18.465
I'm fucking fuming.

13:20.092 --> 13:23.136
I didn't even know you existed
till the bunk bed showed up in me room.

13:24.721 --> 13:27.099
This, you, the business...

13:28.517 --> 13:29.601
Him all over.

13:31.520 --> 13:34.523
Someone else left to deal with the fallout
from his mistakes.

13:36.108 --> 13:38.193
Except this time I'm helping, aren't I?

13:41.697 --> 13:43.782
I'm gonna let
you calling me a mistake slide.

13:50.038 --> 13:52.165
He asked to always make sure
you were okay.

13:54.626 --> 13:58.213
Do you think he knew he was going to
kill himself when he said that?

13:58.714 --> 14:01.466
It was two days before,
so I think so, yeah.

14:04.428 --> 14:06.388
I know I couldn't have done anything
to stop him,

14:06.388 --> 14:08.932
but I will always make sure
that you're okay, Matt.

14:18.817 --> 14:20.194
You wanna come to the flat?

14:20.736 --> 14:21.737
Yeah.

14:23.113 --> 14:24.114
Great.

14:24.198 --> 14:27.034
The Wi-Fi's down. Theresa's raising hell.

14:28.619 --> 14:30.913
What was that message you left
about Mr. Williams?

14:31.788 --> 14:34.458
I have proof that
he thought someone was trying to kill him.

14:34.958 --> 14:36.793
The Williams fella told the psychologist

14:36.877 --> 14:39.213
that he thought someone drugged him
and pushed him into the water.

14:39.213 --> 14:40.756
She needed something to do.

14:40.756 --> 14:42.799
If you're saying
that someone was one of these sisters--

14:42.883 --> 14:45.427
No, we're not--
We're still investigating.

14:45.511 --> 14:49.306
Is that what you were doing yesterday?
Investigating the Garvey girl?

14:50.516 --> 14:52.684
Family first,
little Matt second, remember?

14:52.768 --> 14:54.811
Come on. He's got his priorities straight.

14:55.854 --> 14:58.190
My money's on the sister he maimed.

14:58.190 --> 15:01.818
If some lanky Swedish dickhead took
one of my eyes, I'd want him dead too.

15:01.902 --> 15:04.571
It doesn't matter which one it was.
The widow's the beneficiary.

15:04.655 --> 15:06.823
She's the one we have to prove
knew what they were up to.

15:06.907 --> 15:09.493
What did the guy
who fished JP out of the water say?

15:11.537 --> 15:13.372
He's next on the list. Yeah.

15:15.374 --> 15:18.168
This is what happens when you deny a woman
her Internet connection.

15:28.846 --> 15:31.390
I'm sorry. I have no milk. Cream?

15:31.390 --> 15:33.809
What? No, no.
Jesus. No, no. That would've--

15:33.809 --> 15:35.519
That'd be horrible.

15:35.519 --> 15:36.937
We won't keep you.

15:36.937 --> 15:38.939
We wondered if you could
run us through what happened

15:38.939 --> 15:40.774
the night Mr. Williams nearly drowned?

15:44.444 --> 15:46.655
You're insurance investigators, right?

15:47.573 --> 15:50.325
So what, you're trying
to stop JP's widow getting her payout?

15:50.909 --> 15:52.452
We're trying to establish what happened,

15:52.536 --> 15:55.080
which means looking into
all the events leading up to his death.

15:55.080 --> 15:59.251
I can only tell you what happened after
he got to the marina, nothing before.

15:59.751 --> 16:03.422
Did you see how he entered the water?
-No. But he was on his boat, I think.

16:03.922 --> 16:06.008
Do you think there's a chance
somebody pushed him?

16:06.008 --> 16:07.259
He said he slipped.

16:11.763 --> 16:15.017
You worked with both Mr. Williams
and Eva Garvey.

16:15.017 --> 16:16.935
How would you describe their relationship?

16:17.603 --> 16:18.896
Have you spoken to her?

16:19.396 --> 16:20.480
Why?

16:20.564 --> 16:24.651
Well, she asked me not to tell JP,
but she was there that night.

16:29.031 --> 16:30.949
Did Eva say why she was at the marina?

16:31.533 --> 16:33.619
She said they were there to see me.

16:33.619 --> 16:36.288
Apparently, she saw I was with someone,
so they left.

16:37.289 --> 16:40.417
You didn't believe her?
-Who knows with her and JP?

16:40.501 --> 16:43.128
I thought she just plain hated him,
but then...

16:44.505 --> 16:47.466
It was strange, intense, you know?

16:50.761 --> 16:52.804
Are you still in contact with Eva?

16:55.057 --> 16:56.308
Can I ask what happened?

16:57.100 --> 16:58.310
No.

17:00.062 --> 17:01.438
We'll get out of your hair.

17:06.108 --> 17:10.113
You just said after she saw
you were with someone, they left.

17:11.740 --> 17:12.866
Not, "She left"?

17:12.950 --> 17:15.327
Yeah. Eva was not alone.

17:15.827 --> 17:19.455
Her little sister was in the car. Becka.

17:24.920 --> 17:26.255
Okay. Thank you very much.

17:27.172 --> 17:28.173
Thanks.

17:30.759 --> 17:32.803
Not only was Eva Garvey there that night,

17:32.803 --> 17:35.055
she lied about it
and asked him to lie about it.

17:35.055 --> 17:37.015
This is enough
to get Loftus to exhume the body--

17:37.099 --> 17:40.060
Can we just stop and think for a second?
-And I'm just gonna say this.

17:40.060 --> 17:44.857
I think Becka targeted you to distract you
from whatever her family did to Williams.

17:44.857 --> 17:47.442
What?
-Why else were they there that night?

17:50.946 --> 17:52.281
You're not even arguing with me.

17:52.281 --> 17:54.157
No, 'cause you won't give me a second
to think, Tom.

17:57.411 --> 17:59.830
She had clear financial motive.
-Oh, shit.

18:00.539 --> 18:02.291
You've been seeing her again, haven't you?

18:02.791 --> 18:05.169
Hey, you best tell me now
before the shit really hits the fan.

18:05.169 --> 18:06.253
Matt, please.

18:06.253 --> 18:10.174
Just think about what we have to lose,
how much we've already lost.

18:13.468 --> 18:15.762
I found a check at her apartment.
It was hidden.

18:15.846 --> 18:16.847
What check?

18:16.847 --> 18:18.932
It was from JP's mother to Becka
for eight grand.

18:19.600 --> 18:21.435
If anything, it proves she's done nothing.

18:21.435 --> 18:22.811
How?
-Because she didn't cash it.

18:22.895 --> 18:24.104
Yeah, because she couldn't.

18:24.188 --> 18:27.441
I got Dad's pal at the bank
to check all of the Williams' accounts.

18:27.441 --> 18:29.526
The old lady's was practically empty.

18:29.610 --> 18:32.362
She probably gained her trust
to wheedle thousands out of her.

18:32.446 --> 18:35.449
When that failed, she turned
to that sucker's life insurance.

18:35.991 --> 18:37.534
Tell me you've got it, the check.

18:37.618 --> 18:39.077
No.
-F-- Goddamn.

18:58.055 --> 18:59.056
Yes!

18:59.640 --> 19:01.808
Matt. Matt.

19:02.392 --> 19:03.810
You've done the right thing.

19:04.895 --> 19:06.104
Let's get that body up.

19:15.822 --> 19:16.865
Okay.

19:16.949 --> 19:18.325
That went really well though.

19:18.325 --> 19:20.077
And you know
I have other people to see, but--

19:20.077 --> 19:22.496
Yeah. But I'm through to judges' houses?
-Oh, yeah.

19:22.496 --> 19:23.997
Well done.

19:24.081 --> 19:25.082
Okay.

19:26.542 --> 19:27.876
Sounds like you nailed it.

19:28.669 --> 19:30.712
I don't know.

19:30.796 --> 19:33.465
Hey, hey, hey. It's fine. You've got this.

19:33.966 --> 19:34.967
Yeah?
-Yeah.

19:35.676 --> 19:39.513
I bloody hope so because I have no plan B.

19:40.681 --> 19:45.227
That job was yours even before John Paul
decided to go for a swim with no pants.

19:45.227 --> 19:46.937
Now he's got no chance.

19:48.397 --> 19:49.481
How is he?

19:50.190 --> 19:52.067
He's fine. Yeah. He's fine.
-Yeah?

19:52.067 --> 19:54.319
I still don't understand what happened.

19:54.403 --> 19:55.654
I know.

19:57.030 --> 19:58.574
Do you have no idea?

19:58.574 --> 20:00.200
Well, no. I mean, only what Grace said.

20:00.284 --> 20:04.788
You know, and you,
the hero of the hour, saving his life.

20:05.789 --> 20:07.499
Yeah, well, you could've helped.

20:07.583 --> 20:10.669
You know, it was like dragging a statue
through a swamp.

20:11.712 --> 20:13.922
How do you mean?
-Well, I would've waved to you,

20:14.006 --> 20:16.133
but my hands
were full with your brother-in-law.

20:17.467 --> 20:21.305
I thought it might be some
weird family baptism or so--

20:22.890 --> 20:24.474
Till you fled the scene.

20:25.225 --> 20:29.188
Well, I mean, as a matter of fact,

20:29.188 --> 20:31.982
I was there to see you.

20:31.982 --> 20:34.985
You know,
'cause I wanted a drinking partner,

20:34.985 --> 20:37.779
and then I saw your hot shipmate,

20:38.280 --> 20:40.574
so I left
before you forced me into a threesome.

20:41.575 --> 20:42.701
Right.

20:43.368 --> 20:48.415
But, can you keep it to yourself
that I was there?

20:48.415 --> 20:51.502
Just because if JP finds out,
you know, he'll be--

20:51.502 --> 20:54.713
He'll freak out that I saw him
in that kind of state, you know?

20:55.422 --> 20:56.882
Eyes rolling, balls out.

20:56.882 --> 20:58.592
Yeah. Exactly.

20:58.592 --> 21:00.469
So just keep it to yourself?

21:00.969 --> 21:02.304
Okay.
-Okay.

21:04.932 --> 21:06.225
Oh, shit.

21:18.570 --> 21:21.323
Can I have a word?

21:21.949 --> 21:23.575
Yeah. Of course.

21:24.701 --> 21:27.704
I should thank you.

21:28.455 --> 21:30.874
Yeah, it's fine. It's okay. Are you okay?

21:31.750 --> 21:34.920
Yeah. Yes. Yeah, I'm-- I mean...

21:37.297 --> 21:38.841
I must've tripped.

21:39.591 --> 21:41.051
I banged my head, I think.

21:41.051 --> 21:43.262
You were in a state. Yeah.

21:43.262 --> 21:44.763
Yeah. And...

21:45.514 --> 21:48.392
You haven't said anything
to anybody, have you?

21:49.601 --> 21:51.478
It's none of my business.

21:52.271 --> 21:56.942
And did you see anything?

21:58.277 --> 21:59.486
JP.

22:01.113 --> 22:02.114
Good luck.

22:02.114 --> 22:04.658
Apparently, Eva smashed it in there.

22:21.717 --> 22:23.760
Can I watch TV?
-Course.

22:24.261 --> 22:26.138
I'm watching this thing
about a Korean girl

22:26.138 --> 22:29.600
who kills her boyfriend after she
finds out that he slept with her brother.

22:30.267 --> 22:31.310
Have you seen it?

22:31.310 --> 22:32.936
Girl, I wrote it.

22:33.020 --> 22:34.771
You sort that. I'll get the snacks.
Sound good?

22:34.855 --> 22:35.856
Yeah.

22:43.405 --> 22:45.908
<i>Well, as I see it,
we need to diversify</i>

22:45.908 --> 22:48.327
to ensure a stable flow of income
and growth.

22:50.245 --> 22:53.624
Well, you've clearly done your homework.
-Yes, and everybody else's.

22:54.625 --> 22:56.126
Indeed.

22:56.210 --> 22:59.171
It's a bit indiscreet of me,
but have to say

22:59.171 --> 23:02.216
I'm more than happy with yours
and Eva's performances in interview.

23:02.216 --> 23:04.718
It's really very impressive.

23:05.761 --> 23:07.471
Good. Good.

23:07.471 --> 23:09.181
And you're family.

23:09.890 --> 23:11.266
So, it's a win-win, isn't it?

23:11.350 --> 23:12.351
It is. Yeah, well.

23:12.351 --> 23:14.895
Whoever gets the job,
it keeps it in the family.

23:14.895 --> 23:18.148
Exactly. And, I mean,
she is an amazing woman,

23:18.232 --> 23:20.609
and that isn't just family loyalty.

23:20.609 --> 23:22.736
She never ceases to inspire me.

23:23.862 --> 23:26.823
Everything she's been through,
all she's overcome, and--

23:26.907 --> 23:28.116
The death of her parents?

23:29.159 --> 23:33.747
Yes, that and her breakdown.

23:33.747 --> 23:36.291
The sabbatical she took.

23:37.209 --> 23:40.712
Everybody knows that she likes a drink,
but back then it was...

23:42.214 --> 23:43.966
But she seems to be in control of it.

23:43.966 --> 23:47.010
That's not easy.
My mother struggled for years.

23:47.719 --> 23:51.932
Yeah, well, I mean, if that is something
you can actually ever have under control,

23:52.933 --> 23:54.393
you probably know better than I do.

23:55.185 --> 23:56.270
Unfortunately.

23:59.481 --> 24:01.024
I'm sure she's fine.

24:03.735 --> 24:04.736
Grand.

24:30.095 --> 24:31.096
Perfect.

24:37.895 --> 24:39.271
Filthy bastard.

25:36.578 --> 25:39.164
What are you doing in here?
-I was just tidying up.

25:39.665 --> 25:41.667
I figured Grace had enough
on her plate, so...

25:43.502 --> 25:45.838
All done. How are you doing?

25:47.631 --> 25:48.882
You look great.

25:50.509 --> 25:52.594
Did you just put something in your pocket?

25:52.678 --> 25:55.013
I asked you what's in your pocket.
-Nothing.

25:55.097 --> 25:56.974
Well, you're hiding something.
-I'm not.

25:56.974 --> 25:58.350
What the hell did you take?

25:58.350 --> 25:59.726
Give it back here.
-I--

25:59.810 --> 26:00.936
Give it to me!
-Get off!

26:00.936 --> 26:02.354
Dad!

26:06.567 --> 26:10.445
I'm okay. Your dad's just a bit stressed.

26:11.280 --> 26:13.156
You need anything, you call me, okay?

26:19.329 --> 26:20.372
Fuck.

26:26.753 --> 26:28.922
I'm sorry.
-Why did you do that?

26:29.006 --> 26:30.215
She's only helping.

26:31.258 --> 26:32.759
Rubbish.
-What?

26:34.011 --> 26:38.223
Look... sweetheart.

26:40.475 --> 26:41.602
I'm sorry.

26:43.061 --> 26:44.938
It was a misunderstanding.

26:45.606 --> 26:50.319
I would never,
never do anything to upset you.

26:51.278 --> 26:52.738
You know that, right?

26:54.865 --> 26:56.074
Okay.

26:56.158 --> 26:57.993
Dad's gonna go and have a nap now.

26:57.993 --> 27:01.205
I'll feel more myself
when I've had a lie-down.

27:52.172 --> 27:53.298
What are you doing?

27:54.091 --> 27:57.094
Lurking in the doorway
like a bloody Jehovah's Witness.

27:57.678 --> 28:00.556
I just-- Do you wanna talk?

28:01.223 --> 28:03.600
You've already said you don't believe me.
-Well, that's not true.

28:03.684 --> 28:06.019
I said you were under lots of pressure.

28:06.103 --> 28:10.107
And yet, according to Gerald,
I aced my interview.

28:12.276 --> 28:13.443
Well, that's great.

28:14.486 --> 28:16.780
Yes, you seem exhilarated.

28:17.614 --> 28:20.492
Do you not think it might be a bad time
for you to step up at work?

28:20.576 --> 28:24.913
Grace.
I'm not fragile or weak or suicidal.

28:24.997 --> 28:27.958
Someone tried to kill me.

28:27.958 --> 28:30.502
And don't. Don't look at me like that.

28:33.172 --> 28:34.590
I blame myself.

28:34.590 --> 28:37.009
The only thing worse
than your pity is your self-pity.

28:37.009 --> 28:39.344
I made those demands on you,
made you feel less of a man.

28:39.428 --> 28:42.306
Stop talki-- Just stop talking.
-Drove you to do something so drastic.

28:42.306 --> 28:45.601
I did not try to kill myself.
-Please, JP.

28:45.601 --> 28:47.436
If we could just get you
the help that you need.

28:47.436 --> 28:48.729
Shut up!

28:49.146 --> 28:50.230
No!

29:05.746 --> 29:07.623
Jesus Christ!

29:09.124 --> 29:12.252
Don't creep up on me like that.
-Relax. It's me.

29:13.754 --> 29:16.340
Yeah. Sorry.

29:18.800 --> 29:20.302
I have to get back to work.

29:20.928 --> 29:23.680
What are you doing here anyway?
-Well, what am I supposed to do?

29:23.764 --> 29:26.433
Pretend like it wasn't you in my bed
this last year?

29:26.517 --> 29:28.936
I need to know what's going on.
What's hap--

29:32.147 --> 29:33.148
We can't.

29:34.066 --> 29:35.067
We can.

29:35.817 --> 29:36.818
I can't, Ben.

29:38.237 --> 29:39.238
Come on.

29:45.452 --> 29:47.120
You don't answer my calls, Urs.

29:48.372 --> 29:49.706
You don't return my texts.

29:49.790 --> 29:51.291
I wasn't sure if they were--

29:52.292 --> 29:53.293
If they were what?

29:55.295 --> 29:56.421
We need to take a break.

29:57.422 --> 29:58.423
Why?

29:58.966 --> 30:00.133
It's just for a while.

30:00.801 --> 30:03.470
There's stuff going on that--

30:03.554 --> 30:05.013
What stuff?
-My stuff.

30:06.515 --> 30:08.141
I'm married. I have a family--

30:08.225 --> 30:10.185
And what, you just remembered that now?

30:16.108 --> 30:17.150
For how long?

30:17.985 --> 30:19.152
A week? A month?

30:19.236 --> 30:21.321
I don't know, just please don't-- I--

30:22.114 --> 30:24.366
I'm barely hanging in as it is, okay?
I'm barely--

30:46.096 --> 30:47.472
I have to get back to work.

30:49.975 --> 30:53.145
Well, let me walk you back then.

30:55.105 --> 30:56.398
Please?

30:57.816 --> 30:58.817
Please.

31:07.743 --> 31:09.953
Are you gonna share
your greasy sandwich with me?

31:11.663 --> 31:13.081
So we've ordered a CT,

31:13.165 --> 31:15.083
and we'd like to keep you in overnight
for monitoring.

31:17.544 --> 31:21.215
You're all right, Mammy. I've got you.
-Uh-huh.

31:30.974 --> 31:32.351
Did he hit you?
-Bibi!

31:32.351 --> 31:34.353
What? We're all thinking it.

31:34.353 --> 31:38.774
Well, I tripped and hit my head.
It was 100% my fault.

31:38.774 --> 31:40.817
So, where even is he?

31:41.401 --> 31:44.238
Well, he's at the gift shop with Blanaid.
-Really?

31:44.238 --> 31:47.824
What, because a Lucozade and a bunch
of grapes will make this all better?

31:47.908 --> 31:50.452
It's just a bump on the head
and a sore wrist.

31:50.536 --> 31:52.704
If you could've seen his face
when I came around.

31:53.205 --> 31:54.706
He was more upset than me.

31:56.083 --> 31:57.459
I can't do this.

31:57.543 --> 31:59.086
I have to go. Sorry.

31:59.086 --> 32:01.129
Becka, wait. I need your help.

32:01.213 --> 32:02.339
Anything.

32:03.340 --> 32:05.300
Could you do Minna's shopping for me?

32:05.384 --> 32:07.636
JP usually does it.
She'll be expecting him.

32:07.636 --> 32:08.846
Course.

32:08.846 --> 32:11.265
It'll be just one less thing
for him to worry about.

32:11.265 --> 32:12.975
He's barely recovered himself.

32:19.273 --> 32:20.607
Ladies.
-Hey.

32:21.859 --> 32:24.403
Only the best for my best girl.

32:26.446 --> 32:27.531
How are you, Mum?

32:27.531 --> 32:31.118
I'm just having a little rest.
Will you sit down beside me?

32:33.078 --> 32:34.788
Nice family reunion.

32:36.164 --> 32:37.791
No Ursula today?

32:38.876 --> 32:40.711
You'd think this would be the one place

32:40.711 --> 32:44.089
you actually had a chance
of pinning her down.

32:44.173 --> 32:46.758
I'd say she's very busy, JP.
It is a hospital.

32:46.842 --> 32:49.386
I'm sure she is. I just saw her--

32:49.887 --> 32:53.056
What is he? Photography teacher?

32:53.140 --> 32:54.558
Small world, isn't it?

32:55.184 --> 32:56.685
Well, thank you so much for coming.

32:56.685 --> 32:58.937
I'm sure you've got your own lives
to be getting on with.

32:59.021 --> 33:01.064
I'll take it from here. Bye-bye.

33:06.361 --> 33:08.155
Well, look, hey, you know where we are.

33:08.906 --> 33:10.115
Oh, yeah. Thanks.

33:11.074 --> 33:12.242
Okay.
-Bye.

33:15.454 --> 33:16.955
Could you do me a favor?

33:17.456 --> 33:19.791
Find some water
and a vase for these, please.

33:20.918 --> 33:22.127
Thank you, love.

33:25.047 --> 33:26.924
How are you, really?

33:29.259 --> 33:30.719
I'm so tired.

33:30.719 --> 33:34.848
Just say the word, Mammy.
Anything I can do for you? Anything?

33:37.935 --> 33:40.604
I bought a bottle of whiskey for Gabriel

33:40.604 --> 33:43.357
to say thanks for saving my man.

33:43.357 --> 33:45.108
You could drop it round to his.

33:45.817 --> 33:48.612
Yeah, sure.
-Thank you.

33:51.823 --> 33:54.743
Hey. I just heard. Is she okay?

33:54.743 --> 33:56.828
Yeah, sure. Don't worry.

33:56.912 --> 33:59.373
You're juggling so many things
at the same time.

33:59.373 --> 34:00.791
Don't know how you do it.

34:02.793 --> 34:03.836
See ya.

34:05.712 --> 34:09.132
I thought I'd vomit when I saw her.
She looks so fragile.

34:09.967 --> 34:11.885
There's no booze on this menu.

34:11.969 --> 34:13.428
There's kombucha.
-Fuck off.

34:13.512 --> 34:17.014
If he did this,
surely she'd trust us enough to tell us.

34:17.099 --> 34:18.266
It's not that simple, is it?

34:18.350 --> 34:21.311
If you'd seen the way he flipped
at me earlier, you'd know he did it.

34:21.395 --> 34:22.396
He's dangerous.

34:22.478 --> 34:24.565
So why are they sat there
like everything's peachy?

34:25.107 --> 34:27.442
It's so weird.
-They're just getting closer.

34:27.442 --> 34:30.612
Aren't any of you concerned
that the prick may get his memory back?

34:31.697 --> 34:33.114
Have you got the nasal spray?

34:36.243 --> 34:37.452
Calm down.

34:38.411 --> 34:41.706
I swear to God, you'd have an easier time
offing the bloody Roadrunner.

34:42.958 --> 34:45.502
How do they euthanize
those people in Switzerland?

34:48.297 --> 34:50.632
I don't know. Pentobarbital, maybe?

34:51.132 --> 34:52.426
I'd need to look into it.

34:52.426 --> 34:54.178
Well, we need to finish the job.

34:54.928 --> 34:56.096
And quick.

34:58.098 --> 35:00.559
They have a warm chicken
and black pudding salad.

35:00.559 --> 35:01.852
That sounds lovely.

35:02.769 --> 35:05.063
Excuse me. Hi.

35:06.732 --> 35:08.025
What are you gonna have?

35:08.525 --> 35:09.526
Nothing.

35:09.610 --> 35:10.485
<i>Hello!</i>

35:20.370 --> 35:22.331
Did you start without me?

35:22.331 --> 35:23.707
Mum, look at David's arm.

35:24.333 --> 35:26.502
Oh, my God. What happened?

35:27.002 --> 35:29.421
I fell off my bike. Dad made this.

35:29.505 --> 35:30.839
Well, why didn't you call m--

35:31.965 --> 35:33.592
I need to show your mum something.

35:33.592 --> 35:35.969
Keep watching and tell me what happens.
-But I just--

35:40.098 --> 35:44.228
Your child needed his mum today.
Where were you?

35:47.397 --> 35:48.524
Where were you?

35:49.733 --> 35:51.652
Grace had an accident. Look...

35:52.277 --> 35:53.529
If I had heard your message,

35:53.529 --> 35:56.114
of course, I would've left.
-What about all the other times?

35:59.034 --> 36:02.829
We're your family too.
You, me and those kids.

36:04.289 --> 36:05.707
I know that.

36:05.791 --> 36:07.292
Then why are you never here?

36:17.261 --> 36:18.679
Did I miss anything good?

37:06.018 --> 37:07.019
Hello?

37:11.231 --> 37:13.775
I think it's too short.

37:15.068 --> 37:17.821
Why just with a boat like this...

37:23.577 --> 37:24.953
What are you looking at?

37:47.893 --> 37:49.228
Inspector Loftus.

37:53.524 --> 37:56.485
Despite holding public office,
I have a right to a private life.

37:57.069 --> 37:59.613
This is serious, Inspector.
We have that proof you wanted.

37:59.613 --> 38:01.281
In the John Paul Williams case.

38:03.075 --> 38:04.868
You want to do this now?
-Yeah.

38:06.286 --> 38:07.287
Get back.

38:21.426 --> 38:22.761
Get the trolley, will ya?

38:28.141 --> 38:30.644
Oh, shit.

38:34.982 --> 38:35.983
Tom.

38:42.614 --> 38:44.992
Do you know how much it costs
to exhume a body?

38:47.578 --> 38:49.538
Rich.
-Hey, Fergal.

38:49.538 --> 38:53.542
A murder inquiry in a town like this,
it upsets people,

38:54.418 --> 38:55.919
especially if nothing comes of it.

38:56.003 --> 38:57.713
So you'd wanna be bloody sure.

38:58.755 --> 39:02.384
We have an eyewitness
who saw two Garvey sisters at the marina

39:02.384 --> 39:04.219
on the night of John Paul's accident.

39:04.303 --> 39:05.888
The one where he nearly died.

39:07.472 --> 39:10.225
Add to that the evidence Williams thought
someone was trying to kill him,

39:10.309 --> 39:12.186
the younger sister's financial motive...

39:12.186 --> 39:14.354
Look, if we can get that body up,

39:15.063 --> 39:17.733
we could see what was
in him the night he was killed. Died.

39:17.733 --> 39:21.653
And we also believe that the fire in the
cabin that Mr. Williams made a claim for

39:21.737 --> 39:23.363
was yet another murder attempt.

39:39.963 --> 39:41.423
Okay, you can have your postmortem.

39:42.049 --> 39:43.175
Yes.

39:43.842 --> 39:45.594
I'll get onto the paperwork straightaway.

39:46.094 --> 39:47.429
Here.

39:55.062 --> 39:57.356
The best thing that ever happened to you
was finding that check.

39:57.356 --> 39:58.440
Yeah, I'm over the moon.

39:58.524 --> 40:00.400
Those Garveys are about
to get what's coming to them.

40:00.484 --> 40:03.362
Stay away from her, okay? Okay?

40:04.154 --> 40:05.239
Yeah.

40:08.951 --> 40:10.160
Eva?

40:25.968 --> 40:31.014
Hey, pervert. Are we still on for tonight?
I'm making margaritas.

40:41.942 --> 40:45.571
Help yourself. Thieving little shit.

40:46.738 --> 40:49.950
Geez, it's like having your home raided
by Stanley Tucci.

40:49.950 --> 40:51.827
Sorry. I called.

40:52.327 --> 40:55.998
Do you mind? I'm skint.
-Poor thing.

40:55.998 --> 40:58.917
You can't afford limes
and premium spirits.

40:59.001 --> 41:00.252
That's so sad.

41:02.546 --> 41:03.672
What's the occasion?

41:04.256 --> 41:07.634
I'm just having a friend over tonight.

41:08.218 --> 41:09.386
From school.

41:10.512 --> 41:11.555
Nicola Ferris.

41:12.848 --> 41:14.183
Lucky old Nicola.

41:14.766 --> 41:16.393
Hope she enjoys candlelight.

41:21.148 --> 41:22.566
What are you--
-No. Come on!

41:22.566 --> 41:26.236
The only reason you wax that mustache
is when you're getting some.

41:27.154 --> 41:29.364
I can't make an effort for an old friend?

41:29.448 --> 41:33.535
Oh, no, you can. It's just, I've noticed
you smiling a bit more recently,

41:34.203 --> 41:35.495
around a bit less...

41:35.579 --> 41:37.664
Well, funnily enough, Eva,

41:37.748 --> 41:39.917
my good mood is not down
to some lump of testosterone.

41:39.917 --> 41:41.293
Glad to hear it.

41:42.628 --> 41:44.630
You would tell me though, wouldn't you?

41:46.465 --> 41:49.426
Yeah, I'll write it in my diary
in glitter pen or something.

41:49.510 --> 41:52.054
I just want you to be happy.
-I am happy.

41:53.597 --> 41:56.517
Thanks for the... I've gotta run.

41:56.517 --> 41:58.519
Oh, shit. So do I. I left the bath on.

41:59.728 --> 42:00.729
Balls!

42:02.648 --> 42:06.151
And it's not a mustache, by the way.
It's a little peach fuzz!

42:07.736 --> 42:09.446
And it's charming!

42:43.814 --> 42:47.609
Hey, I don't know if your phone
is outta juice or what's going on.

42:47.693 --> 42:51.405
But I just wanted to say
that I can't wait to see ya,

42:52.447 --> 42:53.824
and I'm excited,

42:55.075 --> 42:56.618
and I've got butterflies even.

42:58.036 --> 43:00.497
And bring ice. My freezer's fucked.

43:11.717 --> 43:12.718
Minna.

43:20.225 --> 43:23.061
Grace asked me to get your shopping.
What are you doing out here?

43:23.145 --> 43:26.690
George has got a poorly chest.
It's time for his hot toddy.

43:28.317 --> 43:29.318
Okay.

43:30.652 --> 43:31.820
Let's get you in.

43:31.904 --> 43:34.156
You'll freeze your nipples off
in that nightie.

43:34.156 --> 43:35.240
No.

43:37.075 --> 43:38.827
Come on, you mad bitch. Get in there.

44:06.980 --> 44:08.690
<i>Hello. Malahide Garda Station.</i>

44:08.774 --> 44:11.735
Hello. I want to speak to someone
about Roger Muldoon.

44:11.735 --> 44:13.153
<i>What's this regarding?</i>

44:13.237 --> 44:16.198
I need to know
if he was still in custody last night.

44:16.782 --> 44:19.576
<i>I'm afraid we can't release
that information to the public.</i>

44:20.786 --> 44:23.038
Thanks. For nothing.

44:27.000 --> 44:31.338
You know, if JP found you
roaming the streets in your scanties,

44:31.338 --> 44:33.757
he'd put you into
that home he was talking about.

44:34.466 --> 44:35.801
He can try.

44:37.094 --> 44:41.682
He says his girls think
my house is a cesspit.

44:42.808 --> 44:44.101
JP told you that?

44:45.185 --> 44:46.979
That's rubbish, Minna.

44:49.064 --> 44:50.858
You're happy in this house, aren't you?

44:51.358 --> 44:53.861
You wouldn't wanna leave?
-Why would I do that?

44:54.570 --> 44:57.072
George calls it our love nest.

44:57.072 --> 45:02.077
He says I'm the only thing
he's ever loved more than his birds.

45:03.078 --> 45:05.330
Don't tell me he romances them too.

45:11.003 --> 45:13.255
He likes to go down there and check.

45:14.631 --> 45:16.758
Check what?
-His birds.

45:18.218 --> 45:19.553
Down where?

45:19.553 --> 45:21.346
The basement.

45:22.639 --> 45:27.686
He used to hate the place,
but now he's there all the time.

45:29.855 --> 45:30.981
George?

45:30.981 --> 45:32.399
John Paul.

45:49.917 --> 45:51.376
So how does he--

46:46.223 --> 46:47.391
What?

47:21.133 --> 47:22.509
What are you looking at?

48:42.256 --> 48:43.590
George.
