No.

36:09.834 --> 36:12.379
Allison's fine. She's just...

36:13.922 --> 36:17.509
Well, I guess you're going to have to ask
yourself who you want to give up.

36:17.592 --> 36:21.096
Your wife, or this lawyer.

36:22.138 --> 36:26.601
Just tell me where she is.
Is she here? Has she been...

36:27.769 --> 36:30.730
- What exactly have you told...
- Don't do this.

36:35.485 --> 36:37.153
- Give me your gun.
- Can't do that.

36:37.237 --> 36:41.783
Yes, you can. I'm your superior.
I give you a command, you obey it.

36:44.577 --> 36:46.454
Give me your gun.

36:53.753 --> 36:55.505
- Paul, it's nothing. It's not...
- Doni

36:55.588 --> 36:56.965
Back up.

37:15.233 --> 37:19.738
It's amazing.
You got it all on only three pages.

37:21.489 --> 37:24.826
You know what would happen
if this fell into the wrong hands?

37:34.169 --> 37:35.420
You named me?

37:36.337 --> 37:39.799
- Right there along with the rest of them?
- I got scared, man. That's all it was.

37:39.883 --> 37:41.342
- You named me!
- No, please, man...

37:41.426 --> 37:43.845
- Danny?
- Allison is due in one month.

37:47.432 --> 37:51.019
Paul, you and me,
we've been friends since the academy.

38:00.904 --> 38:02.155
You named me.

38:03.740 --> 38:04.741
(GUN FIRES)

38:22.759 --> 38:24.093
(PANTING)

38:47.826 --> 38:49.369
Okay. Let's go!

38:52.539 --> 38:56.292
Hey, hey, hey. Put that away, man.
What you doing? Put that away, man.

38:56.626 --> 38:57.752
Hey, yo-yo.

38:59.712 --> 39:03.216
This is a state penitentiary.
You can't park here.

39:04.342 --> 39:06.553
Yo, you think we meant to park here?

39:12.684 --> 39:14.561
Put you hands where I can see them.

39:17.397 --> 39:19.899
I said put your hands
where I can see them!

39:31.995 --> 39:33.413
All fixed.

39:34.122 --> 39:36.749
What do you say, you two hit the road?

39:40.628 --> 39:45.091
You two hit the road right now,
or we're gonna have a problem.

40:14.162 --> 40:15.455
(GRUNTS)

40:16.831 --> 40:18.833
- You all right?
- I'm good.

40:18.917 --> 40:20.919
Haven't been this good in years.

40:38.102 --> 40:39.479
They replaced it.

40:46.986 --> 40:48.196
Michael?

40:49.697 --> 40:50.907
He's there.

40:53.284 --> 40:56.537
Son of a bitch! He's there.

41:01.459 --> 41:03.169
Here, Michael. Use this.

41:06.547 --> 41:07.548
(GRUNTS)

41:09.217 --> 41:10.718
You ready?

41:19.394 --> 41:20.395
(SHUSHING)

41:38.705 --> 41:39.747
Ready?

41:41.958 --> 41:43.084
(BOTH GRUNTING)

42:07.608 --> 42:09.402
What? Talk to me.

42:10.695 --> 42:12.405
- It can't be done.
- SUCRE: What?

42:12.947 --> 42:14.449
SCOFIELD: It's too thick.

42:15.616 --> 42:17.076
I'm so sorry.

42:27.086 --> 42:29.338
We're not getting out of here.

42:32.175 --> 42:34.302
Unfortunately, pretty,

42:34.385 --> 42:36.929
that ain't an option.
