In spite of you.

01:21.724 --> 01:24.206
You killed my friend.

And your black ops buddy
killed mine.

They don't have any intel

07:13.103 --> 07:14.586
All you should be
concerned about

07:14.689 --> 07:16.689
is what happens if you don't.

07:17.931 --> 07:21.034
You know, I ended up in
Sinaloa for a couple of years.

07:21.137 --> 07:24.965
Turns out, informing
on the CIA was of use.

07:25.068 --> 07:26.724
But before I left,

07:26.827 --> 07:30.482
my cartel friends introduced me
to all kinds of torture.

07:30.586 --> 07:34.275
This was the worst.

07:34.379 --> 07:36.379
Tehuacan torture.

07:36.482 --> 07:39.000
The power drill
is scary as hell,

and you pass out.

Maggie's in Hawai'i.

08:04.724 --> 08:06.206
She wasin Hawai'i.

08:06.310 --> 08:09.241
She taught at UH, but she hasn't
worked there in over a year.

08:09.344 --> 08:10.586
She had to get off the grid.

08:10.689 --> 08:12.068
Maggie's too proud to hide.

08:12.172 --> 08:15.068

She didn't have a choice.

08:15.172 --> 08:17.827
At least, that's what she said
in the note that she left me.

08:20.172 --> 08:24.137
I don't know what she did
or why she ran, I swear.

08:24.241 --> 08:26.620
How do I find her?

I don't know.

There's a safe house.

All right?

08:37.413 --> 08:40.000
Maggie's name is not tied to it.

you'll find it.

It's been tricky getting
any eyes there,

I can't seem to find it
in the city.

09:58.172 --> 09:59.931
Maybe they're trying
to move her.

10:00.034 --> 10:02.137
No hits at any airports,
big or small.

10:02.241 --> 10:05.379
I even used satellites
to check remote landing strips.

10:05.482 --> 10:06.586

10:06.689 --> 10:07.655
Caracas is landlocked.

I knew that.

10:08.827 --> 10:10.241
Did you?I know it now.

10:10.344 --> 10:12.655
Point being, if they're
trying to move her

10:12.758 --> 10:16.724
or hide her, the SUV
would've left Caracas.

to be in Venezuela?

say you're just doing your job,

from home.

I think this was
above and beyond.

I was just doing my job.

13:41.379 --> 13:42.482
Yep.

13:42.586 --> 13:44.000
They're safe.

13:44.103 --> 13:46.862
And Kate held her own.

13:47.758 --> 13:49.862
They're coming up.

13:55.068 --> 13:56.827
LUCY:
Next time you run off to play

13:56.931 --> 13:59.241
super secret agent, don't.

13:59.344 --> 14:01.206
Promise.

14:03.379 --> 14:06.034
That looks like it needs
some attention.

14:06.137 --> 14:08.034
TENNANT:Any word on Creel's
whereabouts?

14:08.137 --> 14:09.689
Ernie's tracking his
network of mercenaries

14:09.793 --> 14:11.758
and all the numbers linked
to those cell phones.

14:11.862 --> 14:12.896
So we should have
something soon.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.517
How do you know he'll be here?

14:14.620 --> 14:16.655
Because I told him this
is where he could find Maggie.

14:16.758 --> 14:18.413
He's desperate.

14:18.517 --> 14:20.689
He thinks she can help him
solve his cash flow problem.

14:20.793 --> 14:23.931
Which will be hard,
her being in prison and all.

14:24.034 --> 14:25.413
SWIFT:
Tennant?

14:25.517 --> 14:27.379
Glad you're home.

14:34.275 --> 14:35.448
Thanks for sending Sam.

14:35.551 --> 14:38.241
Sounds like
you handled it just fine.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.344
Adrian Creel is coming
to Hawai'i.

14:45.275 --> 14:50.137
Friends at the CIA read me in
to the file on Adrian Creel.

14:50.241 --> 14:52.344
They said he was killed
by rivals in-country.

14:52.448 --> 14:55.137
Do you know who signed off
on that report?

14:55.241 --> 14:58.000
Maggie Shaw and you.

14:59.068 --> 15:01.103
Seems like you were quite wrong.

15:01.206 --> 15:04.517
I was. We were.

15:04.620 --> 15:07.862
And now, years later,
he sent someone to look for me.

15:07.965 --> 15:08.793
Why?

15:08.896 --> 15:10.103
Does it matter?

15:10.206 --> 15:12.931
I wasn't safe.
My family wasn't safe.

15:13.034 --> 15:14.793
Are you sure your little trip
didn't make this worse?

15:14.896 --> 15:15.758
I had no choice.

15:15.862 --> 15:16.862
Sure you did.

15:16.965 --> 15:18.137
Your team
has your back.

15:18.241 --> 15:19.724
The FBI has
your back.

15:19.827 --> 15:21.586
Hell, even I have your back.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.862
There's more to this.

15:24.965 --> 15:26.586
Even I know that.

15:26.689 --> 15:30.206
Question is,
will you tell me what it is?

15:32.379 --> 15:35.068
He's responsible for the deaths
of eight U.S. operatives,

15:35.172 --> 15:36.620
including Charlie 1.

15:36.724 --> 15:39.137
[scoffs]
Well, that's a no.

15:39.241 --> 15:41.758
But we're still
gonna catch this guy.

15:41.862 --> 15:46.034
Except... we'll do it my way.

15:48.137 --> 15:51.137
[clears throat]
Fair enough.

15:51.241 --> 15:53.620
My way's been a bit bumpy.

15:56.965 --> 15:59.379
BOLOs have turned up
nothing so far.

15:59.482 --> 16:00.689
Well, we may not know
where Creel is,

16:00.793 --> 16:02.241
but we know where he's been.

16:02.344 --> 16:04.241
Creel mentioned to Tennant
he was in Sinaloa.

16:04.344 --> 16:08.689
Turns out he was, though under
an alias, Joshua Kinne.

16:08.793 --> 16:10.448
From there, he bounced
around the world,

16:10.551 --> 16:12.275
manipulating his way
into the inner circles

16:12.379 --> 16:16.517
of different crime syndicates,
rebel groups, regimes.

16:16.620 --> 16:17.551
ERNIE:
The FBI

16:17.655 --> 16:19.068
has been surprisingly useful.

16:19.172 --> 16:20.379
[gasps]

16:20.482 --> 16:22.655
Sorry. I mean that
in a grateful way.

16:22.758 --> 16:24.689
Creel is on-island.

16:24.793 --> 16:28.206
A private jet arrived with
bogus passenger information.

16:28.310 --> 16:29.586
How do you know it's bogus?

16:29.689 --> 16:31.862
Recognize anything
about those names?

16:31.965 --> 16:33.758
LUCY:
"Niall Horan.

16:33.862 --> 16:35.310
Liam Payne, Zayn Malik..."

16:35.413 --> 16:37.482
Those are the guys
from One Direction.

16:38.379 --> 16:40.586
I mean, um, they're...

16:40.689 --> 16:43.620
Aren't those those guys
from One Direction?

16:43.724 --> 16:45.241
Sure.

16:45.344 --> 16:46.724
And besides the fact
they're broken up,

16:46.827 --> 16:49.413
social media has them all
safely somewhere else.

16:49.517 --> 16:51.103
Well, local airport knows
to clear out personnel

16:51.206 --> 16:53.137
if they think it's VIPs
coming to the island.

16:53.241 --> 16:54.551
Were you able to track
the passengers

16:54.655 --> 16:55.689
who were on the plane?

16:55.793 --> 16:57.034
Trail goes cold.

16:57.137 --> 17:00.379
So, what now?

17:01.413 --> 17:03.103
[hisses]

17:03.206 --> 17:04.827
[exhales]

17:04.931 --> 17:06.448
Thank you for doing this.

17:06.550 --> 17:10.344
You need an X-ray.
And a proper cast.

17:10.448 --> 17:11.758
Preferably administered
in a space

17:11.862 --> 17:13.689
not shared by Cheetos and soda.

17:13.792 --> 17:15.792
I'll take that under advisement.

17:16.655 --> 17:18.550
It's broken.Yeah, I figured.

17:18.655 --> 17:20.205
I'm not talking
about your wrist.

17:20.310 --> 17:22.550
Though it is
indeed very broken.

17:22.655 --> 17:25.241
Your energy.

17:26.931 --> 17:28.172
[knocking on door]

17:28.275 --> 17:29.586
Sorry to interrupt.

17:29.689 --> 17:30.896
It's okay.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.793
Commander Chase
was just finishing up.

17:32.896 --> 17:35.413
Let go.

17:37.241 --> 17:39.172
I like your new digs.

17:39.275 --> 17:41.827
I can, uh, give you a briefing
and get my protein.

17:41.931 --> 17:43.379
[chuckles]:
Yeah, well,

17:43.482 --> 17:46.793
you joke, but Swift seems
pretty comfortable in my office.

17:46.896 --> 17:50.172
Hopefully not for too long.
Creel is on-island.

17:50.275 --> 17:52.310
When?Couple hours ago.

17:52.413 --> 17:53.758
But we're not sure
where he's gotten to.

17:53.862 --> 17:55.310
All right, well,
we need to figure that out,

17:55.413 --> 17:56.965
or lure him out.You know,
I got put on, uh,

17:57.068 --> 17:59.758
desk duty
because I stood up for you.

17:59.862 --> 18:02.862
All right, well, you shouldn't
be punished for what I did.

18:02.965 --> 18:04.206
I'll talk to Swift,

18:04.310 --> 18:05.620
get you back
in the field.

18:05.724 --> 18:08.103
You think I care about
pushing some paper?

18:08.206 --> 18:09.482
Tennant,

18:09.586 --> 18:12.137
I would put my life
on the line for you.

18:17.482 --> 18:19.034
You have questions.

18:19.137 --> 18:20.310
We all do.

18:20.413 --> 18:23.620
Boss, we deserve
to know what happened.

18:28.310 --> 18:34.068
Years ago, Adrian Creel
fed us some bad intel.

18:34.172 --> 18:35.896
Operatives were killed.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.655
Maggie and I were
supposed to apprehend him,

18:38.758 --> 18:42.103
bring him to the CIA, and they
were gonna question him.

18:42.206 --> 18:43.896
But you didn't.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.862
He got those men killed.

18:45.965 --> 18:47.827
He didn't deserve
a second chance.

18:47.931 --> 18:51.137
I believed that in my heart.

18:51.241 --> 18:54.827
I just couldn't bring myself
to kill him.

18:54.931 --> 18:57.068
Why not?I don't know.

18:57.172 --> 19:00.103
Maggie must have known
I wouldn't go through with it,

19:00.206 --> 19:02.586
because she planted
a bomb and...

19:02.689 --> 19:05.172
You guys lied to cover it up.That operation
was poison

19:05.275 --> 19:06.689
from start to finish.

19:06.793 --> 19:08.551
And when that bank account
got emptied,

19:08.655 --> 19:10.310
there was a voice in my head
that said he's still alive.

19:10.413 --> 19:12.482
He had to be alive.And you didn't want

19:12.586 --> 19:14.310
to keep looking over
your shoulder for him.

19:14.413 --> 19:17.689
No. Not then, not now.

19:17.793 --> 19:19.689
Okay, so let's make sure
that doesn't happen.

19:19.793 --> 19:22.448
Look, I wouldn't ask you to put
your life on the line for me.

19:22.551 --> 19:25.275
You'd never have to.

19:40.344 --> 19:42.241
It's good to be home.

19:48.551 --> 19:50.068
What do we think
they're talking about?

19:50.172 --> 19:51.758
TENNANT: I went to see her
before I went to Venezuela.

19:51.862 --> 19:53.620
He's probably trying to find out
if I told her anything.

19:53.724 --> 19:54.793
Did you?

19:54.896 --> 19:57.827
I didn't have to.
She already knew it.

19:57.931 --> 19:59.482
And probably some
things you don't.

19:59.586 --> 20:01.931
Certainly shown she's good
at keeping secrets.

20:02.931 --> 20:04.655
Okay. Where are we?

20:04.758 --> 20:07.344
I've created an online pattern
of life for Maggie

20:07.448 --> 20:09.310
based on what you told Creel.

20:09.413 --> 20:11.068
Enough to seem
real, not so much

20:11.172 --> 20:13.931
that it seems as if it's trying
to point at something.

20:14.034 --> 20:15.206
I helped him with it.

20:15.310 --> 20:16.448
This version of Maggie
is basically

20:16.551 --> 20:18.206
my mother,
without all the judgment.

20:18.310 --> 20:19.413
I learned a lot.

20:19.517 --> 20:21.068
KAI:
The CIA created a cover story

20:21.172 --> 20:22.448
when Maggie got arrested,

20:22.551 --> 20:24.655
explaining why she left
the university.

20:24.758 --> 20:26.137
That seemed solid.

20:26.241 --> 20:28.620
But we coordinated with
the FBI, the CIA and the DIA

20:28.724 --> 20:31.172
to make sure the information
about her espionage and arrest

20:31.275 --> 20:32.620
is behind a firewall.

20:32.724 --> 20:34.517
And then we put that
behind a firewall.

20:34.620 --> 20:36.482
Okay. And what about
the safe house?

20:36.586 --> 20:38.137
Prepped and ready to go.

20:40.172 --> 20:41.758
Okay. We're gonna need to use
the War Room for updates.

20:41.862 --> 20:43.379
Jesse, can you take
Swift upstairs

20:43.482 --> 20:44.862
and run him through everything?

20:47.103 --> 20:48.620
[phone vibrating]

20:57.896 --> 20:59.827
Why are we meeting
in a dark corner?

20:59.931 --> 21:01.482
I'm avoiding Swift.

21:01.586 --> 21:02.586
Why?

21:02.689 --> 21:03.896
Because I don't want him
to ask me

21:04.000 --> 21:05.896
about everything
Tennant did in Venezuela.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.793
Mm, understood.

21:07.896 --> 21:09.896
What did Tennant do
in Venezuela?

21:10.000 --> 21:10.965
I don't know.

21:11.068 --> 21:11.965
You don't have to protect me.

21:12.068 --> 21:13.310
I know.

21:13.413 --> 21:16.275
I just... I mean,
I-I know what happened.

21:16.379 --> 21:20.275
I'm just not exactly sure why
all those things happened.

21:20.379 --> 21:21.827
She didn't tell you?

21:21.931 --> 21:23.206
No.Hardly fair.

21:23.310 --> 21:25.172
You were there being all brave
and kick-ass.

21:25.275 --> 21:26.620
[laughs]

21:26.724 --> 21:28.586
You really do know
how to give a compliment.

21:28.689 --> 21:30.862
I didn't need to
know the reasons

21:30.965 --> 21:33.275
why we were doing
what we were doing.

21:33.379 --> 21:37.413
Tennant's family,
and she needed me.

21:39.137 --> 21:41.206
Number 83.

21:42.034 --> 21:43.344
83 what?

21:43.448 --> 21:45.034
Reasons why I love you.

21:45.137 --> 21:47.379
Incredible loyalty
just popped to 83.

21:47.482 --> 21:49.034
What is in the top ten?

21:49.137 --> 21:51.551
Oh, I'll tell you later.

21:51.655 --> 21:52.551
Okay.

21:52.655 --> 21:55.586
Then instead of that,

21:55.689 --> 21:58.862
how about you tell me
the NCIS plan to catch Creel?

22:13.034 --> 22:14.896
[door beeps]

22:15.000 --> 22:16.965
I assumed you had
more to discuss.

22:17.068 --> 22:19.137
Did I blink too fast,
pull my earlobes?

22:19.241 --> 22:20.482
What was my tell?

22:20.586 --> 22:22.689
Letting Jesse fill Swift in.

22:22.793 --> 22:25.000
You are many things,
but obsequious toady

22:25.103 --> 22:26.620
is not one of them.

22:27.551 --> 22:29.413
So, what's your plan
to catch Creel?

22:29.517 --> 22:31.758
Adrian Creel is smart,

22:31.862 --> 22:33.758
but wrongly believes that
he's smarter and more charming

22:33.862 --> 22:37.172
than everyone else in the room,
no matter what size the room.

22:37.275 --> 22:38.689
But he must not be,

22:38.793 --> 22:40.793
otherwise nice CIA ladies
wouldn't want to off him

22:40.896 --> 22:42.379
because he clustered
a mission.

22:42.482 --> 22:44.275
Correct.So, we're
going to lean

22:44.379 --> 22:46.724
into Creel's sense
of superiority

22:46.827 --> 22:51.034
and trick him into
revealing himself.

22:51.137 --> 22:52.689
What do you need me to do?

22:53.551 --> 22:55.137
Help me lose Swift.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.344
Because he's
an obsequious toady,

22:57.448 --> 22:59.241
playing to the NCIS brass
at headquarters?

22:59.344 --> 23:00.931
[laughs softly]

23:01.034 --> 23:04.586
Let's just say that his goals
and my goals may not align.

23:05.482 --> 23:07.206
What are your goals?

23:07.310 --> 23:10.448
Catch Creel, put him in jail,
protect the ones I love.

23:10.551 --> 23:11.965
Not in that order.

23:12.068 --> 23:13.793
Look, if this at all

23:13.896 --> 23:16.517
makes you uncomfortable,
you don't have to do it, okay?

23:16.620 --> 23:19.965
I'll still think
you're the absolute best.

23:20.068 --> 23:22.793
So, what should I do?

23:22.896 --> 23:24.793
[door closes]

23:24.896 --> 23:26.931
[phone vibrating]

23:30.482 --> 23:33.344
Hey, Alex.

23:33.448 --> 23:34.896
Julie.

23:35.000 --> 23:36.586
Hi, baby.

23:36.689 --> 23:39.344
It's nice of your brother
to let you use his phone.

23:41.379 --> 23:44.034
I miss you, too.

23:44.137 --> 23:47.034
How was snorkeling?

23:47.137 --> 23:48.551
Mm-hmm.

23:48.655 --> 23:50.862
Yeah. The trunkfish.

23:50.965 --> 23:52.896
I love them, too.
It's like a swimming purse.

23:53.000 --> 23:55.068
[whispers]:
Creel's making a move.All right, hey.

23:55.172 --> 23:57.068
I got to go, okay?
I'll call you later.

23:57.172 --> 24:00.034
Tell your brother
I'm sorry I missed him.

24:00.137 --> 24:02.482
I love you. Bye.

24:05.000 --> 24:06.724
[door beeps]Well, to clarify,

24:06.827 --> 24:08.689
Creel's guy is on the move.

24:08.793 --> 24:11.206
Creel himself is
nowhere to be seen.

24:12.206 --> 24:14.448
He must have entered your house
through the side door.

24:14.551 --> 24:16.068
This guy's a pro.

24:16.172 --> 24:19.172
He's familiar with where someone
like me would hide things.

24:19.275 --> 24:20.724
Versus where I'd hide things.

24:20.827 --> 24:22.551
I think you're pretty clever.

24:22.655 --> 24:24.965
I bet you've got
some good hiding places.

24:25.068 --> 24:26.724
Actually,
I don't have anything to hide.

24:26.827 --> 24:29.000
Maybe that's
what makes me clever.Mm-hmm.

24:30.827 --> 24:32.275
All right, he's got it.

24:32.379 --> 24:34.000
What's in there?
The usual.

24:34.103 --> 24:36.344
Cash, prescription medications,
a multi-tool,

24:36.448 --> 24:38.206
plus a burner phone
with a contact list encrypted

24:38.310 --> 24:39.551
with a not-so-challenging cipher

24:39.655 --> 24:41.586
to keep Creel
searching here on-island.

24:41.689 --> 24:44.586
My go bag's got
granola bars in it.

24:44.689 --> 24:45.965
He's making a move.

24:46.068 --> 24:47.310
Copy that.

24:47.413 --> 24:48.620
Switching
to vehicle surveillance.

24:48.724 --> 24:50.413
We'll alert the rest
of the team.

24:53.103 --> 24:54.827
We're up.

24:56.448 --> 24:58.206
LUCY:
Unit 3 is peeling off.

24:58.310 --> 24:59.827
We're assuming the lead.

24:59.931 --> 25:02.034
That road's gonna
make it hard for handoffs.

25:02.137 --> 25:03.586
LUCY:
Nothing up this way but schools

25:03.689 --> 25:04.620
and sleepy neighborhoods.

25:04.724 --> 25:06.103
Where is he going?

25:10.586 --> 25:11.724
Something's not right
about this.

25:11.827 --> 25:13.551
KAI:
He's stopping at a bridge.

25:14.620 --> 25:15.758
We got no choice
but to pass him.

25:15.862 --> 25:17.896
We need to grab him.We want Creel.

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
And right now,
this guy's our best connection.

25:21.517 --> 25:23.241
He's out of the car
with the bag.

25:25.068 --> 25:27.448
You're authorized
to apprehend the suspect.

25:27.551 --> 25:29.379
[tires screech]

25:29.482 --> 25:31.034
[siren wails]

25:35.620 --> 25:37.000
NCIS. Don't move.

25:49.068 --> 25:50.724
Well, seems clear he knows
we're on to him.

25:50.827 --> 25:52.241
Has the guy we arrested
said anything interesting?

25:52.344 --> 25:54.000
JESSE:
He hasn't said anything
at all, but Kai and Lucy

25:54.103 --> 25:55.551
will stay on him.TENNANT:
Guess there's no chance

25:55.655 --> 25:57.275
Creel calls his guys
thinking they still have me.

25:57.379 --> 26:01.137
No, but let's keep monitoring
their contacts just in case.

26:01.241 --> 26:03.034
Will do, buckaroo.

26:04.068 --> 26:05.965
I'm colloquial.
It doesn't mean anything.

26:06.068 --> 26:08.620
The encrypted list in the bag
is gonna take him a beat,

26:08.724 --> 26:10.241
but he'll still be nervous
about relying on it

26:10.344 --> 26:12.034
even when he figures out which
one is supposed to be Maggie.

26:12.137 --> 26:14.379
Too nervous to act
on the information?

26:14.482 --> 26:15.689
I don't know.

26:15.793 --> 26:18.275
What do we do while
we wait to find out?

26:18.379 --> 26:19.931
TENNANT:If you're just gonna
have Maggie sit in there

26:20.034 --> 26:22.931
until you're sure Creel
took the bait, not much.

26:23.034 --> 26:24.965
Maggie Shaw is a clear
flight risk.

26:25.068 --> 26:26.137
I'm not gonna
let her out

26:26.241 --> 26:27.655
in the world like
she's not serving

26:27.758 --> 26:29.172
a life sentence for treason.

26:32.620 --> 26:34.172
Understood.

26:39.655 --> 26:42.586
I'm not a flight risk.

26:42.689 --> 26:43.896
You're listening to us?

26:44.000 --> 26:45.793
I'm lipreading,
which is different.

26:45.896 --> 26:47.965
I only get about half.

26:48.068 --> 26:50.827
Just the boss half
because both you and Swift

26:50.931 --> 26:52.551
were the only ones facing me.

26:52.655 --> 26:56.000
[scoffs] No doubt Ernie would've
been a lot more interesting.

26:56.103 --> 26:57.689
Okay, I'm really not
in charge here.

26:57.793 --> 26:59.724
But Swift is an idiot.

26:59.827 --> 27:02.034
Creel is not gonna fall
for this lame plan.

27:02.137 --> 27:03.724
I've got to be out there
so he can find me.

27:03.827 --> 27:05.724
Look, I've pitched that,

27:05.827 --> 27:07.655
but he is just not willing to...

27:09.137 --> 27:11.206
What am I not willing to do?

27:13.206 --> 27:16.551
Maggie believes that Creel
will come out of the shadows

27:16.655 --> 27:19.655
if he can see her
and stalk her a bit.

27:19.758 --> 27:20.827
And convince himself

27:20.931 --> 27:22.379
that he can grab her

27:22.482 --> 27:23.758
and escape.

27:23.862 --> 27:26.068
So, what do you suggest?

27:26.172 --> 27:28.827
That I give you a bullhorn,
let you stand on Waikiki Beach?

27:28.931 --> 27:31.689
No, I thought maybe I could
go to a grocery store,

27:31.793 --> 27:34.206
or, you know,
get a cup of coffee.

27:34.310 --> 27:35.827
This guy has been
hiding for years.

27:35.931 --> 27:37.758
He doesn't want to get caught.

27:37.862 --> 27:40.172
He also doesn't want
to end up dead.

27:40.275 --> 27:42.275
He wants money.

27:42.379 --> 27:44.689
CIA dark money which he thinks
I know something about.

27:44.793 --> 27:47.137
Do you?

27:48.896 --> 27:50.896
Jane Padilla knew nothing.

27:51.000 --> 27:53.241
Jane Tennant knows even less.

27:53.344 --> 27:56.344
Agent Swift, as interesting
as the money is,

27:56.448 --> 27:59.689
Creel also wants revenge,
and the more he sees me,

27:59.793 --> 28:01.931
the more we remind him of that

28:02.034 --> 28:04.896
and the greater the chance
he makes a mistake.

28:05.000 --> 28:06.931
Catching him is gonna be
really hard,

28:07.034 --> 28:10.517
and it's gonna require
some risk.

28:10.620 --> 28:12.862
And your friend might end up on
the wrong end of all that risk.

28:12.965 --> 28:15.034
I guess you didn't
read the whole file.

28:15.137 --> 28:18.551
Jane and I, um,
we aren't friends.

28:18.655 --> 28:19.965
Not anymore.

28:20.068 --> 28:22.000
You both know him
better than I do.

28:23.379 --> 28:25.068
We'll do it your way.

28:31.103 --> 28:32.551
Let's talk about the plan.

28:32.655 --> 28:34.275
I thought we just did.

28:38.724 --> 28:40.206
MAGGIE:
Ah.

28:41.241 --> 28:42.275
Um, cozy.

28:42.379 --> 28:44.034
We marked all the places
you'll go.

28:44.137 --> 28:45.206
Coffee shop,

28:45.310 --> 28:47.034
fresh greens market,
flower shop.

28:47.137 --> 28:49.275

at all of them.

28:52.517 --> 28:53.931
Couple hundred dollars in there.

28:54.034 --> 28:56.586
Take the car out, be normal.

28:56.689 --> 28:59.827
Let's see if Adrian Creel is out
in the world waiting for you.

28:59.931 --> 29:03.000
Normal. Got it.

29:04.344 --> 29:06.896
So, what happened
to the two of them?

29:07.758 --> 29:09.896
I bet you read the case file.Yeah.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.068
But files don't always
tell the whole story.

29:12.172 --> 29:13.586
MAGGIE:
Jane...

29:13.689 --> 29:16.241
When all this is over, I'll...

29:16.344 --> 29:18.965
either be dead
or back in prison.

29:19.068 --> 29:21.275
And if it's the former,
well...

29:22.241 --> 29:25.000
I won't have to live
with all my sadness and regret.

29:25.103 --> 29:26.758
If it's the latter,

29:26.862 --> 29:29.172
I can't be sorry
for trying to save my son.

29:29.275 --> 29:33.000
But I am so very sorry
for hurting you.

29:36.103 --> 29:38.103
Is that supposed to
make it better, Maggie?

29:38.206 --> 29:40.620
I would've done the same thing
if you had been in trouble.

29:40.724 --> 29:43.896
Yeah, but see, I would've never
put you in that position.

29:45.655 --> 29:47.206
I know.

29:48.482 --> 29:51.379
You've always been
different like that.

29:51.482 --> 29:54.655
You're better, really,
than the rest of us.

29:55.620 --> 29:59.275
There are some lines
you just won't cross.

30:00.724 --> 30:02.965
We're all supposed to be
like that.

30:04.482 --> 30:06.000
Are we?

30:08.275 --> 30:11.137
I don't want you
to ever lose that.

30:13.689 --> 30:16.103
And no matter what,

30:16.206 --> 30:19.620
I will always love you
like a daughter,

30:19.724 --> 30:22.655
and I'll just keep hoping

30:22.758 --> 30:25.241
that one day
you will forgive me.

30:26.137 --> 30:28.275
Everyone's listening.

30:28.379 --> 30:29.344
I know.

30:29.448 --> 30:30.793
But like I said,

35:10.551 --> 35:12.241
JESSE:
Is that a cell phone?

35:13.241 --> 35:14.482
Did Tennant lift the cell phone

35:14.586 --> 35:15.793
from downstairs?

35:15.896 --> 35:17.689
Wait, never mind.
Don't answer that.

35:17.793 --> 35:19.000
I wasn't going to.

35:19.103 --> 35:20.379
But hypothetically,
if the two of them

35:20.482 --> 35:22.413
hatched a plan to get Creel,

35:22.517 --> 35:25.275
it requires that both of them
are trustworthy, and...

35:25.379 --> 35:26.689
One of them is clearly not.

35:28.689 --> 35:31.517
I'm not sure Tennant knows
what she's gotten herself into.

35:31.620 --> 35:34.482
Ernie, how did they get away

35:34.586 --> 35:37.241
from aerial
and satellite surveillance?

35:38.758 --> 35:40.896
Right.

35:41.000 --> 35:42.724
So what canyou tell me?

35:45.655 --> 35:47.379
[keyboard clicks]

35:47.482 --> 35:50.172
This is the last place
that cell phone pinged.

35:51.068 --> 35:53.586
Look at the paint job
on that car.

LUCY:
Spray can,

35:55.448 --> 35:56.620
just to change the color.

35:56.724 --> 35:58.448
Ernie, we need to know
where they went.

35:58.551 --> 36:00.827
It might be Tennant against
Creel and Maggie right now.

36:00.931 --> 36:03.448
I'll find her.

36:03.551 --> 36:05.103
Hey.

36:05.206 --> 36:07.448
And the safe house footage...

36:12.000 --> 36:13.379
Yeah.

36:16.758 --> 36:17.931
[door closes]

36:22.689 --> 36:25.000
The account you cleaned out
wasn't the main account.

36:25.103 --> 36:27.241
It was the "you" account.

36:27.344 --> 36:28.379
I just didn't have time

36:28.482 --> 36:30.724
to empty it after...

36:30.827 --> 36:32.655
the incident.

36:35.275 --> 36:37.137
You mean the attempt

36:37.241 --> 36:38.413
on my life?!

36:38.517 --> 36:39.896
Tomato. Tomato.

36:43.931 --> 36:46.103
Ah!
[laughs]

36:46.206 --> 36:48.241
Not bad, for being
one-handed and all.

36:48.344 --> 36:49.931
Put it on the ground.

36:50.034 --> 36:51.586
Don't do it.Shut up.

the shots right now.

After all this.

37:53.379 --> 37:56.344
I've got too much to lose now.

39:02.689 --> 39:04.758
WHISTLER:
Search didn't turn up anything.

39:04.862 --> 39:06.793
I guess Maggie's good
at getting away.

39:06.896 --> 39:08.448
The best.

39:08.551 --> 39:10.448
We've got alerts at all
the airports and harbors.

39:10.551 --> 39:12.551
If she tries to get off
the island, we'll know.

39:12.655 --> 39:14.931
I think patience is a virtue
for her right now.

39:15.034 --> 39:20.034
She'll lay low until everyone
gets bored, then she leaves.

39:20.137 --> 39:21.448
Using what money?

39:21.551 --> 39:22.931
Well, that's the thing
about a slush fund.

39:23.034 --> 39:24.000
It's slushy.

39:24.103 --> 39:25.655

Good night, everyone.

What happens now?

39:33.448 --> 39:35.482
I don't know.

valuable prisoners

Yeah, and you put a really
bad guy out of commission.

39:40.793 --> 39:43.448
Not sure how the scales
tip on that.

39:44.310 --> 39:46.379

he's talking to?

39:48.655 --> 39:51.379

how this is gonna go.

very by the book.

This whole situation
seems like an exception.

40:12.206 --> 40:13.586
No.

40:13.689 --> 40:15.379
I'm not sure what other secrets
she's hiding,

40:15.482 --> 40:20.793
or what other cretins this
will bring out of the woodwork.

40:20.896 --> 40:23.896
Well, that's the problem
with our friends at the CIA.

40:26.068 --> 40:27.620
Yeah.

40:28.862 --> 40:30.965
Couldn't hurt
to plus-up the team.

all you've been through.

All you've done.
Maybe I never will.

41:11.275 --> 41:13.344
But...

41:13.448 --> 41:16.206
I know you.

41:16.310 --> 41:19.689
And you help people.
