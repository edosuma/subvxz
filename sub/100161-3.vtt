01:22.299 --> 01:23.902
My dad needs a favor.

01:23.996 --> 01:25.261
Fuck it!

It was pretty
spectacular, Ray.

02:46.106 --> 02:47.341
I'm talkin'...

02:47.539 --> 02:49.669
genuine hand of God here...

02:49.871 --> 02:51.786
I think...

02:52.414 --> 02:54.145
I may be blessed.

02:57.356 --> 02:59.137
You don't wanna know
what happened?

02:59.478 --> 03:00.653
No.

03:01.970 --> 03:03.598
Not even curious?

03:07.081 --> 03:09.731
You know, you live through
somethin' like that, and...

03:09.925 --> 03:11.987
it gets you thinkin'
about

03:12.075 --> 03:13.676
what's really important...

03:14.293 --> 03:16.653
our purpose here,
shit like that.

03:22.224 --> 03:23.817
Where we goin', Ray?

03:24.833 --> 03:26.676
Those cops you chopped up...

03:28.169 --> 03:29.622
one of the heads came up.

03:30.321 --> 03:31.755
Jesus.

03:34.247 --> 03:35.653
What are you gonna do?

03:35.741 --> 03:38.020
Gonna make it easy
for them to pin it on you.

03:38.277 --> 03:40.098
I'm not going back
to prison.

03:40.296 --> 03:42.048
I can't go back, Ray.

03:42.319 --> 03:43.674
Course you can't.

03:43.762 --> 03:45.130
You're dead.

04:01.625 --> 04:04.231
That was a nice urn
you bought for me.

04:05.081 --> 04:07.661
I'm not sure about the...
Eternal Flame thing.

04:07.749 --> 04:09.630
I didn't know
they made those.

04:10.229 --> 04:12.583
Kind of a strange...

04:13.059 --> 04:16.208
strange choice, actually,
for a guy who burned to death.

04:23.394 --> 04:25.395
You can admit
you were sad, Ray,

04:25.498 --> 04:28.488
when you heard that I was dead.
It's only natural.

04:28.887 --> 04:29.932
‐ What?

04:30.020 --> 04:31.466
‐ Nothing to be ashamed of.

04:31.591 --> 04:33.208
No one would judge ya
for it

04:33.296 --> 04:35.481
if you shed a tear or two
for your old man.

05:06.387 --> 05:08.966
I want you to stand there,
put your prints on the door.

05:09.451 --> 05:12.037
Sure... yeah.

05:13.724 --> 05:15.356
I'm puttin' 'em
everywhere here.

05:22.324 --> 05:24.660
He was right here
when I popped him.

05:26.375 --> 05:27.747
What?

05:28.264 --> 05:31.551
The cop I shot, when I saved
your life, Raymond.

05:32.123 --> 05:33.249
Here.

05:33.715 --> 05:35.098
Blow your nose.

05:36.070 --> 05:38.880
Sure... my blood.

05:42.169 --> 05:44.028
Ooh, that's a lotta DNA.

05:45.268 --> 05:46.864
Have a party.

06:28.129 --> 06:29.906
So why didn't I
go up in flames?

06:30.022 --> 06:31.883
It was like the <i>Titanic.</i>

06:32.406 --> 06:34.125
Remember in the <i>Titantic</i>

06:34.766 --> 06:38.896
where... the rear of the boat
goes up in the air

06:38.984 --> 06:40.992
and everyone else
is drowning?

06:41.277 --> 06:44.203
It's the same thing
because the back of the bus...

06:44.651 --> 06:47.414
sorta catches all the bumps
the hardest.

06:47.570 --> 06:49.937
So the security door
just opened right up

06:50.591 --> 06:51.779
like the Red Sea partin'.

06:52.218 --> 06:54.258
And I'm out the fuckin' door.

06:58.943 --> 07:00.789
Shoulda seen the explosion,
Ray, and the...

07:01.052 --> 07:02.484
flames.

07:02.729 --> 07:06.234
And me flyin' through the air
out the back of the bus...

07:06.376 --> 07:09.337
carried on angel wings
or something.

07:09.729 --> 07:11.189
What kinda boat did you take?

07:11.437 --> 07:13.008
One‐a those little
Whalers out there.

07:13.828 --> 07:15.672
Wasn't normal, Ray.

07:16.132 --> 07:18.492
Was from somethin' else,
ya know?

07:19.648 --> 07:20.983
Sign this.

07:35.050 --> 07:36.531
The fuck is that?

07:37.168 --> 07:39.078
They'll match up
the handwritin'.

07:39.955 --> 07:41.531
Bein' a cop killer's
one thing, Ray,

07:41.619 --> 07:43.454
but don't make me look
stupid.

07:53.820 --> 07:55.164
Ah, yeah.

07:55.393 --> 07:58.472
You popped seven rounds
into a guy just sittin' down.

07:58.735 --> 08:00.339
Put your prints
on this.

08:00.778 --> 08:02.768
Didn't wanna give him
a chance, did ya?

08:07.452 --> 08:09.095
‐ Let's go.
‐ Wait a minute.

08:09.308 --> 08:10.581
What?

08:11.826 --> 08:13.940
I would never get rid
of a gun

08:14.101 --> 08:15.964
and not wipe it down.

08:17.222 --> 08:18.598
But...

08:20.674 --> 08:23.081
Under the duress of a murder,

08:23.457 --> 08:25.636
I might accidentally...

08:26.083 --> 08:27.793
leave a new print

08:28.203 --> 08:30.143
as I'm wipin' down the old.

08:31.509 --> 08:32.729
You're welcome.

08:36.485 --> 08:39.110
Jesus fuckin' Christ.

08:54.563 --> 08:55.766
The <i>Post.</i>

08:56.805 --> 09:00.851
[♪♪♪]

09:14.422 --> 09:16.665
‐ Ma!
‐ Oh, my baby.

09:17.079 --> 09:18.548
Hi.

09:19.343 --> 09:22.221
‐ I missed you.
‐ Oh, my sweetheart.

09:22.309 --> 09:23.893
Let me look at you.

09:24.883 --> 09:26.031
Been a long time, huh?

09:26.114 --> 09:27.438
Mm‐hmm.

09:28.539 --> 09:30.391
Sorry about Mickey.

09:33.197 --> 09:34.758
About that...

09:47.462 --> 09:48.704
What is this?

09:48.862 --> 09:50.446
The story's
changed.

09:51.094 --> 09:52.223
Okay...

09:52.307 --> 09:54.141
My father killed everyone.

09:55.690 --> 09:57.191
Pleasure to meet you.

09:57.479 --> 09:58.844
You have lovely eyes.

09:59.276 --> 10:02.779
This is the guy Mac told you
killed Rad, Al, and Bianchi.

10:04.258 --> 10:05.501
Him?

10:05.680 --> 10:08.454
You're not exactly
meeting me at my best, darling.

10:08.718 --> 10:10.719
Where's that leave Mac
in all this?

10:10.968 --> 10:12.595
He's not a cop killer.

10:23.102 --> 10:24.946
That was a kindness
you did, Raymond.

10:25.034 --> 10:27.298
A <i>mitzvah,</i> like the Jewish
people call it.

10:27.501 --> 10:28.571
What?

10:28.743 --> 10:30.579
Supportin' the widow.

10:31.497 --> 10:33.852
That's the fuckin' purpose
I'm talkin' about.

10:42.462 --> 10:43.602
Hi, Ray.

10:43.690 --> 10:45.999
Make the calls.
Destroy the phones.

10:46.087 --> 10:47.133
Is that Sandy?

10:47.221 --> 10:48.552
You don't have ta
tell me that.

10:48.640 --> 10:50.183
I'm not a fuckin' amateur.

10:52.295 --> 10:53.473
Let me talk to her.

10:54.216 --> 10:57.290
You're dead.
You don't talk to anyone.

11:21.982 --> 11:24.691
Hello, is this the tip line?

11:24.829 --> 11:26.552
‐ <i>Yes, it is.</i>
‐ Good.

11:26.890 --> 11:30.841
Listen, uh... I was
pickin' up trash today

11:30.955 --> 11:32.880
in an alley behind, uh,

11:32.974 --> 11:35.841
272 Altoona Street.

11:36.177 --> 11:38.621
I like to volunteer

11:38.841 --> 11:40.864
and beautify the neighborhood.

11:41.279 --> 11:44.614
And I found something
very strange...

11:44.863 --> 11:46.872
a bloodied shirt and a gun.

11:47.005 --> 11:48.919
<i>A bloody shirt and gun.
And what was your name?</i>

11:49.007 --> 11:53.595
Uh, no, dear, I, uh,
I will not leave my name.

11:54.100 --> 11:56.300
Uh... the <i>Bible</i> tells us

11:56.388 --> 11:59.098
never to practice
our good deeds in public

11:59.454 --> 12:04.200
or we'll have no reward
from our Father in heaven.

12:14.946 --> 12:16.364
I mean, I'm not saying
I'm vain...

12:16.459 --> 12:18.536
Uh‐huh.

12:22.997 --> 12:24.250
Daryll Donovan.

12:25.207 --> 12:26.168
Yeah, what's up?

12:26.290 --> 12:28.485
Detective Perry.
NYPD.

12:30.126 --> 12:31.147
I have some questions

12:31.235 --> 12:33.118
about the night
of November seventh.

12:33.551 --> 12:35.134
November seventh?

12:35.950 --> 12:37.431
What, like last year
November seventh?

12:37.519 --> 12:39.104
You remember where
you were that night?

12:39.192 --> 12:40.673
Ah... yes.

12:40.877 --> 12:43.040
I do, um, I went to...

12:43.136 --> 12:45.087
Madison Square Garden
for the first time.

12:45.266 --> 12:46.415
The J. W. H. show.

12:46.503 --> 12:48.130
J.W.H. show.

12:48.524 --> 12:50.134
Jonathan Walker Hanson.

12:50.369 --> 12:51.923
And, oh, yes,
he killed it.

12:52.018 --> 12:54.103
He must be thrilled
with the new demographic.

12:54.868 --> 12:56.157
What?

12:56.501 --> 12:58.540
Can anyone else
confirm you being there?

12:58.667 --> 13:01.272
Yeah, my, um, I went with
my brother and my niece

13:01.360 --> 13:02.405
and her husband.

13:02.493 --> 13:04.446
- ‐ Your family; of course.
- ‐ Yeah.

13:04.534 --> 13:07.257
Oh, and, uh, you know,
we got to go backstage

13:07.345 --> 13:09.389
and, like, meet
Jonathan Walker Hanson.

13:09.477 --> 13:12.382
And, uh, we also met his, uh,
producer Adam Rain.

13:12.652 --> 13:13.891
I ask them about you,

13:13.979 --> 13:15.380
‐ they'll remember?
‐ I don't know,

13:15.468 --> 13:17.430
I mean... I mean,
we had a good talk, though.

13:17.518 --> 13:19.751
We talked about, like,
you know, baseball,

13:19.889 --> 13:21.641
like the Dodgers, Yankees,
who's better.

13:21.729 --> 13:23.407
Oh, he, yeah, he likes dogs.

13:23.555 --> 13:26.399
‐ Who?
‐ Jonathan Walker Hanson.

13:26.487 --> 13:27.529
I said that already.

13:27.647 --> 13:29.751
I need receipts,
ticket stubs,

13:29.839 --> 13:32.055
selfies of you backstage
with those dogs.

13:32.143 --> 13:35.258
Otherwise, next time,
I'm gonna have to take you in.

13:36.821 --> 13:38.290
Okay.

13:38.790 --> 13:40.501
Have a good day.

13:44.868 --> 13:48.251
Okay, so what was <i>that</i>
all about?

13:48.504 --> 13:49.812
Ma, I dunno!

13:49.941 --> 13:50.962
Mm‐hmm.

13:51.050 --> 13:54.649
Well, it sounds like
some Donovan bull‐shit to me.

13:55.508 --> 13:57.235
Ma, don't worry about it,
all right?

13:57.323 --> 13:58.758
We good!

13:58.946 --> 14:00.610
Daryll...

14:01.230 --> 14:03.837
you gonna land your ass
in prison.

14:05.249 --> 14:06.618
Shit!

14:16.738 --> 14:18.446
‐ Is this the tip line?
‐ <i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

14:18.534 --> 14:21.454
Ah... so listen, uh...

14:21.628 --> 14:26.001
I was suckin' off one‐a
my Johns the other day and...

14:26.089 --> 14:30.260
he runs a boat rental outfit
over there on Long Island.

14:30.348 --> 14:31.725
<i>North Shore or South Shore?</i>

14:31.813 --> 14:34.941
Yeah, right near where all
those heads is comin' up.

14:35.117 --> 14:36.368
<i>So, Huntington?</i>

14:36.844 --> 14:38.509
Yeah, that's right.

14:38.593 --> 14:40.204
<i>And which rental
store in Huntington?</i>

14:40.292 --> 14:41.803
- ‐ Uh‐huh.
- ‐ <i>No, whi...</i>

14:41.891 --> 14:42.972
You got it.

15:02.912 --> 15:04.212
Terry.

15:06.396 --> 15:07.743
You came back.

15:08.672 --> 15:10.399
Yeah, I‐I did.

15:11.292 --> 15:14.102
I... I wanna do it
again.

15:16.970 --> 15:18.446
Come on.

15:27.118 --> 15:28.219
<i>A raise?</i>

15:28.307 --> 15:30.547
‐ Yeah.
‐ A raise.

15:31.919 --> 15:34.547
I protected the store,
right, I saved lives.

15:34.658 --> 15:37.084
What you did, Brendan...
firing a weapon,

15:37.172 --> 15:40.712
injuring two people...
that is not our safety policy.

15:40.912 --> 15:42.712
Well, fuck your safety policy,
all right?

15:42.956 --> 15:44.305
Those gunmen...

15:44.393 --> 15:45.724
Gunmen?

15:46.032 --> 15:47.899
You shot a teenager
in the back...

15:48.018 --> 15:49.868
who now is in intensive care.

15:50.449 --> 15:53.355
‐ Intensive care?
‐ And God forbid if he dies,

15:53.443 --> 15:55.695
you'll be getting whatever's
the opposite of a raise.

15:56.293 --> 15:58.377
<i>Lawyers and corporate
are coming in later today</i>

15:58.465 --> 16:01.416
<i>to decide whether we're
defending you, firing you,</i>

16:01.504 --> 16:02.746
<i>or suing you,</i>

16:02.834 --> 16:04.088
<i>and you want a raise.</i>

16:04.573 --> 16:06.973
<i>Read your contract...</i>

16:17.613 --> 16:18.642
Yeah.

16:18.730 --> 16:20.215
<i>That little person.</i>

16:20.598 --> 16:21.723
What?

16:21.872 --> 16:23.676
<i>The picture
of the little person.</i>

16:23.997 --> 16:26.254
‐ What about him?
<i>‐ He won't talk, will he?</i>

16:26.502 --> 16:29.402
‐ No.
<i>‐ Good. That's good.</i>

16:29.836 --> 16:31.838
The D. A.'s gonna file charges
against Sullivan...

16:31.962 --> 16:34.520
child endangerment,
sex crimes.

16:36.830 --> 16:39.043
I want you to find me
a ten‐year‐old boy.

16:39.472 --> 16:41.387
‐ What for?
<i>‐ To say he was the kid</i>

16:41.475 --> 16:42.949
<i>in the picture.</i>

16:44.510 --> 16:45.988
I want you to do that.

16:49.718 --> 16:51.004
Trouble?

16:59.102 --> 17:01.543
The Fortress
of Solitude, huh?

17:06.039 --> 17:08.541
What's, uh, what's with
all the tequila?

17:09.152 --> 17:10.478
It's Tommy Wheeler's
place.

17:10.566 --> 17:12.559
We're just usin'
the back for a while.

17:15.458 --> 17:16.541
You could put the Raiders

17:16.626 --> 17:18.269
of the fuckin'
Lost Ark in here.

17:18.451 --> 17:19.618
Hey, guys.

17:21.549 --> 17:23.596
‐ You got everything?
‐ Yeah, the money and ticket

17:23.684 --> 17:25.560
are ready... just give me
a second with the passport.

17:25.646 --> 17:27.394
Hey, Smitty, man.

17:28.058 --> 17:29.379
You all right?

17:29.496 --> 17:30.957
I'm fuckin' here.

17:32.642 --> 17:34.027
Back from the dead.

17:34.115 --> 17:35.894
Like the Son of God risen up.

17:36.840 --> 17:38.637
Adam Rain sent you that.

17:44.228 --> 17:46.564
I was in the bus
with everyone else,

17:47.054 --> 17:49.963
and I‐I'm... workin' on
these cuffs that were tight

17:50.051 --> 17:51.324
and I'm tryin'
to loosen 'em.

17:51.412 --> 17:53.706
And I checked
my, uh, four‐leaf clover.

17:53.794 --> 17:55.921
See?
Got a four‐leaf clover there.

17:56.152 --> 17:57.324
Luck o' the Irish.

17:57.412 --> 17:59.691
Does, uh... he know
he's goin'?

18:00.926 --> 18:02.176
Not yet.

18:04.246 --> 18:05.258
‐ Puhhh... puuuhhhh...
‐ Hey, Ray.

18:05.341 --> 18:07.152
Have you...
have you heard this story?

18:07.595 --> 18:08.730
Yeah, I heard it.

18:08.818 --> 18:10.904
‐ It's fuckin' amazing, it's...
‐ Yeah, and I...

18:11.006 --> 18:12.257
I musta gone out.

18:12.364 --> 18:15.129
I musta gone out
for a second or two.

18:21.598 --> 18:23.613
So where're we goin'?

18:23.823 --> 18:25.840
To see the shaman.

18:27.428 --> 18:28.902
W‐what does he do?

18:29.183 --> 18:30.668
Parkinson's.

18:31.520 --> 18:33.582
Cancer, Alzheimer's,

18:33.744 --> 18:35.723
autism, manic depression.

18:36.015 --> 18:38.402
It's all just blocked
channels in the body.

18:38.743 --> 18:40.660
You shove western medicine
into those channels,

18:40.748 --> 18:43.584
and that pharmaceutical poison
just blocks 'em even more.

18:43.705 --> 18:45.525
But what the shaman does

18:45.613 --> 18:48.465
is he asks you to clear
those channels.

18:49.213 --> 18:50.465
So...

18:50.587 --> 18:52.238
this guy c...

18:52.683 --> 18:54.393
can cure me?

18:54.734 --> 18:58.316
He is going to show you
a way to cure yourself.

19:02.535 --> 19:06.035
I see nothin' but red,
smoke, and fuckin' flames

19:06.140 --> 19:08.074
and a little flicker
off to the side,

19:08.162 --> 19:09.455
and it's burnin' metal.

19:09.681 --> 19:10.932
And I...

19:11.020 --> 19:13.105
Uh...
can I help you?

19:13.374 --> 19:15.056
I need to speak with
Ray Donovan.

19:15.144 --> 19:16.302
Uh, do you have
an appointment?

19:16.389 --> 19:19.418
Just... tell him that
Kevin Sullivan's sister's here.

19:25.225 --> 19:26.324
Sullivan.

19:26.904 --> 19:28.655
You got people in Boston?

19:30.385 --> 19:31.480
I do...

19:31.568 --> 19:33.027
Mr. Wallace.

19:34.148 --> 19:37.285
Mr. Wallace, right this way.

19:40.066 --> 19:43.176
Oh! Oh, yes, dear.

19:55.346 --> 19:57.637
Can we speak privately?

19:58.274 --> 19:59.613
Sure.

20:10.589 --> 20:12.699
Is that Jim Sullivan's
daughter?

20:14.670 --> 20:15.879
I‐I don't know.

20:15.971 --> 20:17.371
Grew into a beauty.

20:17.661 --> 20:19.637
Seems nice enough, too,
which is a miracle,

20:19.725 --> 20:22.426
considering her father's
a legitimate piece of shit.

20:22.621 --> 20:23.887
Have a seat.

20:24.699 --> 20:26.691
I found something
that I wanted to give you.

20:26.774 --> 20:27.926
Yeah?

20:37.941 --> 20:39.879
Your sister
was my babysitter.

20:41.765 --> 20:43.926
And she used to have me
put makeup on her

20:44.246 --> 20:45.464
and, like,
feather her hair.

20:46.621 --> 20:48.080
Do you remember that look?

20:52.973 --> 20:54.496
What do you want?

20:57.777 --> 21:00.676
You made my brother look like
something he's not.

21:00.873 --> 21:01.887
Yeah?

21:02.273 --> 21:04.108
Look, I know
you won't take money.

21:04.480 --> 21:05.490
I've got a feeling

21:05.578 --> 21:07.705
you're not a man who
gives a shit about threats.

21:10.925 --> 21:12.754
I guess I was just hoping.

21:14.405 --> 21:15.824
Hopin' what?

21:19.186 --> 21:21.832
Bridget told me you were
the best person she knew.

21:23.159 --> 21:24.918
I guess I was hoping...

21:25.322 --> 21:28.426
maybe that Ray Donovan
might still be around.

21:38.348 --> 21:39.599
What's goin' on?

21:42.638 --> 21:44.418
He's got something
on her brother.

21:44.871 --> 21:47.652
He's got a picture
of Kevin Sullivan

21:47.741 --> 21:49.871
sucking on some guy's cock.

21:54.392 --> 21:56.651
You got, uh, pictures
of Jim Sullivan's kid

21:56.739 --> 21:58.447
suckin' cock,
huh?

21:58.535 --> 21:59.307
‐ Yeah.
‐ Finished?

21:59.395 --> 22:00.982
What you got goin' on
with the Sullivans?

22:01.069 --> 22:02.512
‐ That's for you.
‐ You know what

22:02.600 --> 22:05.457
‐ you're getting into?
‐ That's a one‐way ticket.

22:06.486 --> 22:07.820
The Maldives.

22:08.154 --> 22:09.207
Yeah.

22:09.301 --> 22:11.043
"Martin O'Dea"?

22:11.750 --> 22:13.723
You couldn't find
a more Irish name, huh?

22:14.657 --> 22:16.168
Here, put these on.

22:17.496 --> 22:18.988
Sendin' me away, huh?

22:19.676 --> 22:21.684
Ray, I'm dead.

22:21.856 --> 22:23.441
No one's lookin'
for me no more.

22:23.529 --> 22:25.074
Yeah?
How long is that gonna last?

22:25.162 --> 22:26.914
Forever
and a fuckin' day.

22:27.002 --> 22:29.426
That's why I'm a fuckin'
huge asset.

22:31.938 --> 22:33.064
Yeah.

22:33.152 --> 22:36.529
Okay, Ray, this detective
is, like, sweatin' me, okay?

22:36.612 --> 22:37.870
<i>She's gonna come back
like at any minute.</i>

22:37.957 --> 22:40.527
‐ Calm down, Daryll.
<i>‐ I am calm, all right?</i>

22:40.615 --> 22:42.598
But if she gets back here,
okay,

22:42.686 --> 22:43.858
a‐and I don't have credentials

22:43.945 --> 22:47.198
or a p... or a picture of me
and J. W. H.'s dog backstage,

22:47.288 --> 22:49.249
<i>she's gonna put
my black ass in jail.</i>

22:49.337 --> 22:50.582
I'll be right over.

22:57.429 --> 22:58.731
Let's go.

23:06.483 --> 23:10.176
[♪♪♪]

23:26.293 --> 23:28.512
What do ya think?

23:33.846 --> 23:35.918
Okay, first,
give me your meds.

23:43.121 --> 23:44.496
All of 'em.

23:58.527 --> 23:59.793
Let me show you around.

24:08.652 --> 24:11.168
I could do
plastic surgery, Ray.

24:11.715 --> 24:13.137
Get a whole new face.

24:13.902 --> 24:15.848
Get rid of these
fingerprints, too.

24:16.117 --> 24:17.879
People do dat.

24:25.184 --> 24:27.728
Oh, where the hell are we?

24:28.522 --> 24:30.457
Little slice of heaven.

24:30.545 --> 24:31.824
Hoo!

24:40.824 --> 24:42.200
Stay here.

25:10.725 --> 25:12.060
‐ What'd you tell her?
‐ What?

25:12.738 --> 25:16.152
The cop... I need to know exactly
what you fuckin' told her.

25:16.394 --> 25:18.188
Hello, Ray.

25:21.216 --> 25:23.427
Uh, she, uh,
came for Pop's funeral.

25:28.652 --> 25:30.309
So how have you been?

25:37.686 --> 25:40.332
Here's a ticket stub
and a badge.

25:40.462 --> 25:42.464
Give it to the cop
next time you see her.

25:42.548 --> 25:43.549
'Kay.

25:43.913 --> 25:45.915
Try to keep your
fuckin' mouth shut.

26:28.440 --> 26:30.709
Raymond, is that Claudette?

26:31.795 --> 26:33.348
‐
‐ What's she doin' here?

26:33.432 --> 26:35.599
She came for your fuckin'
funeral.

26:43.585 --> 26:45.443
She came for my funeral.

27:05.419 --> 27:07.349
Wait here, just a moment.

27:31.451 --> 27:32.825
Hey, Bunch.

27:35.974 --> 27:37.881
Why didn't you testify?

27:38.966 --> 27:40.099
What?

27:40.966 --> 27:43.591
<i>I know you didn't
need the money, but...</i>

27:44.451 --> 27:47.840
You coulda at least been there
when I had to take the stand,

27:47.923 --> 27:51.248
you know,
in front of all those priests.

27:53.209 --> 27:54.847
Where are you?

28:01.126 --> 28:02.584
Farley's.

28:19.341 --> 28:20.884
What's up?

28:22.380 --> 28:24.427
You have a question
for me, Terry?

28:29.610 --> 28:32.209
I‐I‐I just wanna get better.

28:33.550 --> 28:34.951
We can help you.

28:38.263 --> 28:39.506
How?

28:41.283 --> 28:43.560
Our cosmovision incorporates

28:43.648 --> 28:46.427
ancestral medical techniques...

28:47.584 --> 28:51.146
with a view of humankind and
its place in the universe...

28:51.951 --> 28:54.677
grounded in a devotion
to Pachamama,

28:54.765 --> 28:56.177
Mother Earth.

28:59.124 --> 29:02.753
In other words, we will
help you return to yourself.

29:04.201 --> 29:05.873
The rest is up to you.

29:08.772 --> 29:09.904
Thanks.

29:12.661 --> 29:14.459
You've been fighting
your whole life.

29:15.006 --> 29:17.175
You're fighting right now.

29:18.427 --> 29:19.678
Yeah.

29:20.052 --> 29:22.060
Stop... don't fight them.

29:25.518 --> 29:26.557
W‐wha...

29:26.645 --> 29:28.572
Let yourself be part of them.

29:36.859 --> 29:38.908
Think of it this way,
Terry.

29:41.203 --> 29:42.861
Your hands are still.

29:45.543 --> 29:47.572
It's the world
that's trembling.

30:04.979 --> 30:06.275
Ya all right?

30:10.361 --> 30:13.354
I'm sorry I said what I said
when I called ya.

30:13.442 --> 30:14.455
Just...

30:14.986 --> 30:16.518
Don't worry about it.

30:17.810 --> 30:20.111
Let's get outta here.
Come on.

30:22.406 --> 30:25.229
When I went in to ask for
a raise after what I...

30:26.314 --> 30:27.963
after what I did...

30:29.822 --> 30:31.260
you know what they said?

30:31.778 --> 30:32.963
What?

30:35.984 --> 30:38.900
That they might fuckin'
sue me or...

30:39.318 --> 30:40.775
fire me.

30:43.661 --> 30:45.744
I was protectin' the store.

30:48.626 --> 30:50.156
You did the right thing,
Bunch.

30:50.244 --> 30:52.705
I shot a fucking kid
in the back!

30:55.008 --> 30:56.775
You did
what had to be done.

30:58.720 --> 31:01.346
What nobody in that fuckin'
store had the nerve to do.

31:02.580 --> 31:05.455
Shit hit the fuckin' fan,
you stood up...

31:05.803 --> 31:07.510
and did what had to
be done.

31:10.783 --> 31:11.963
Say it.

31:15.578 --> 31:16.854
Say it.

31:22.518 --> 31:24.008
I did
what had to be done.

31:24.096 --> 31:25.393
Yeah.

31:26.080 --> 31:27.494
That's right.

31:28.510 --> 31:30.174
Let's get the fuck
outta here.

31:43.799 --> 31:46.838
Ray's forcin' me
to leave the country, Bunch.

31:48.627 --> 31:49.799
Yeah?

31:51.627 --> 31:53.068
Yeah, after all I done
for everybody.

31:53.322 --> 31:54.961
All I done for you.

31:56.166 --> 31:58.939
Tell him I won't be
a problem, Bunch.

32:01.419 --> 32:03.432
Yeah, you will, Mick.

32:04.637 --> 32:06.764
You're always
a fuckin' problem.

32:19.994 --> 32:21.908
Hey, Detective!

32:21.996 --> 32:23.189
Uh, come on in.

32:28.312 --> 32:31.774
Heard about your father.
My condolences.

32:32.139 --> 32:33.900
Uh, yeah, thanks.

32:34.065 --> 32:35.729
We got a few calls today.

32:35.908 --> 32:37.346
Anonymous tips.

32:37.525 --> 32:38.547
Led us to a gun
in Staten Island

32:38.630 --> 32:40.632
with your father's prints.

32:41.091 --> 32:43.182
Another call led us
to a marina.

32:43.270 --> 32:45.736
Some fishermen in the area
said they saw a man

32:45.824 --> 32:47.455
fitting the description
of your father

32:47.543 --> 32:48.753
out on the water that day.

32:49.643 --> 32:52.619
Said he wasn't alone.
Said he was with a black man.

32:52.918 --> 32:55.588
Late 30s, early 40s.
Well‐built.

32:55.691 --> 32:57.902
And my son's the only person
in five boroughs

32:57.990 --> 33:00.534
that fits that description,
right?

33:02.591 --> 33:04.033
The backstage pass
and the tickets

33:04.121 --> 33:05.961
that you was asking about...
just... excuse me.

33:08.118 --> 33:09.118
I don't, uh...

33:09.379 --> 33:11.968
I normally don't, uh,
keep this kinda shit,

33:12.064 --> 33:14.270
but, you know, it was
a special night.

33:14.517 --> 33:15.556
Wow.

33:15.731 --> 33:18.746
His first‐ever middle‐aged
African‐American fan.

33:18.965 --> 33:21.047
Yeah, my man even, uh,
he signed it,

33:21.131 --> 33:22.754
uh, "To Daryll."

33:23.159 --> 33:24.243
The real deal.

33:24.593 --> 33:25.863
Impressive.

33:26.428 --> 33:28.221
You mind if I hold on
to these?

33:29.931 --> 33:31.165
Sure, if you want.

33:31.727 --> 33:33.235
I appreciate all your help.

33:33.636 --> 33:35.471
I'll circle back.

33:45.876 --> 33:47.704
We were a good team
today, Ray.

33:47.845 --> 33:50.735
Donovan and son.

33:51.036 --> 33:53.095
Donovan and Donovan.

33:53.854 --> 33:55.856
I'm askin' ya...

33:56.291 --> 33:58.048
let me be useful.

34:01.326 --> 34:03.102
You gotta go, Mick.

34:14.063 --> 34:16.087
You'll, uh,
come visit me, right?

34:18.143 --> 34:19.771
Sure.

34:20.565 --> 34:22.071
They got huts...

34:22.387 --> 34:24.766
in the ocean out there.

34:25.134 --> 34:28.087
People actually live on
stilts over the water.

34:28.829 --> 34:30.337
Yeah.

34:30.871 --> 34:33.181
A little sharky, but, uh...

34:34.454 --> 34:36.321
they say it's beautiful.

34:39.844 --> 34:41.835
Hey. Hey.

34:43.463 --> 34:45.563
You were
always my favorite.

34:47.341 --> 34:49.431
You say that
to all your sons, Mick.

34:53.391 --> 34:55.946
It's true every time I say it.

35:01.484 --> 35:03.141
Ray...

35:04.665 --> 35:06.653
I accept your forgiveness.

35:07.376 --> 35:09.235
I thought about it.

35:10.235 --> 35:12.158
And I accept it.

35:15.954 --> 35:17.548
Fine.

35:19.071 --> 35:21.227
And I forgive you.

35:22.627 --> 35:24.001
Fine.

35:24.298 --> 35:26.218
You should go through,
Mick.

35:54.587 --> 35:57.308
Think we're bad sons,
Ray?

36:05.629 --> 36:07.339
Pull over the car.

36:07.422 --> 36:08.462
Why?

36:08.550 --> 36:11.177
Just pull over
the fuckin' car.

36:11.516 --> 36:13.235
What's goin' on?

36:15.065 --> 36:16.274
Hey.

36:16.897 --> 36:18.235
Bunch.

36:29.298 --> 36:31.063
I don't wanna close
this case.

36:31.151 --> 36:33.173
Do you know much heat
there is on this?

36:33.261 --> 36:35.612
Not just from upstairs
but above upstairs.

36:35.700 --> 36:37.118
‐ I do.
‐ So close it up.

36:37.202 --> 36:39.227
‐ It doesn't feel right.
‐ Feel right.

36:39.621 --> 36:40.991
You got a gun
with fingerprints

36:41.079 --> 36:42.475
and ballistics report
to match.

36:42.563 --> 36:44.087
And no motive and no logic.

36:44.175 --> 36:45.678
‐ Don't haggle.
‐ It's a frame job.

36:45.766 --> 36:47.696
His father couldn't've
done this alone.

36:47.784 --> 36:49.702
You got three solved
murders to your name here.

36:49.922 --> 36:51.858
Michael Donovan
was a son of a bitch,

36:51.946 --> 36:53.077
and we can all feel grateful

36:53.165 --> 36:55.853
- that murderin' psychopath is dead.
- But you're gonna let Ray Donovan

36:55.940 --> 36:57.733
‐ get away with fucking m...
‐ Shut it down.

36:59.147 --> 37:01.946
Take the win and call it
a day, Detective.

37:08.173 --> 37:10.439
I got the D. A. ready
to draw up an indictment,

37:10.527 --> 37:11.850
<i>and I need to announce
the deal.</i>

37:11.938 --> 37:13.822
So get me the camera
and a fucking kid

37:13.905 --> 37:15.524
by the end of the day.

37:18.118 --> 37:19.376
You left early
last time.

37:19.681 --> 37:21.290
Yeah, I wanted
to apologize for that.

37:21.462 --> 37:23.868
Oh, I'm not asking
for an apology.

37:24.048 --> 37:26.532
I'm just curious about
what you were feeling.

37:27.922 --> 37:29.462
I lost control.

37:30.425 --> 37:31.759
That happens when I drink.

37:32.798 --> 37:34.618
Did you drink more
after you left?

37:34.881 --> 37:35.966
Yeah.

37:36.714 --> 37:38.313
Wanna talk about that?

37:38.649 --> 37:40.204
Not really.

37:42.108 --> 37:44.368
You wanna talk about
your father?

37:47.415 --> 37:48.970
Okay.

37:51.296 --> 37:53.298
Is there anything
you wanna talk about?

37:58.010 --> 37:59.727
Somethin' my sister said.

38:00.660 --> 38:01.977
What?

38:09.299 --> 38:10.876
When we were kids...

38:11.602 --> 38:12.774
Um...

38:13.061 --> 38:15.230
Before my mother got sick,
before all this...

38:18.336 --> 38:20.078
We read these books together.

38:21.102 --> 38:22.634
They were about, uh...

38:23.532 --> 38:25.306
about a veterinarian
in London.

38:25.394 --> 38:27.187
There were four of them...

38:27.481 --> 38:29.298
<i>All Creatures
Great and Small,</i>

38:29.507 --> 38:31.415
<i>All Things Bright
and Beautiful,</i>

38:31.516 --> 38:33.563
<i>All Things
Wise and Wonderful,</i>

38:33.651 --> 38:35.196
<i>And The Lord God
Made Them All.</i>

38:35.284 --> 38:37.673
Yeah, I know those books.
I read them too.

38:41.065 --> 38:43.041
I thought I should be
somethin' like that, you know?

38:43.128 --> 38:44.384
Veterinarian...

38:45.586 --> 38:47.454
someone who helps animals.

38:48.025 --> 38:49.243
Or people.

38:49.427 --> 38:50.524
What?

38:51.579 --> 38:53.673
Someone who helps people.

39:02.689 --> 39:03.790
Yeah.

39:30.141 --> 39:31.485
Missed it.

39:31.918 --> 39:33.725
There was some real
"Eleanor Rigby" shit

39:33.813 --> 39:35.001
goin' on in here.

39:35.202 --> 39:36.912
Sorry, family stuff.

39:38.445 --> 39:40.618
You know what's actually
kind of incredible?

39:41.326 --> 39:43.665
I mean, he sang beautifully.

39:43.919 --> 39:45.424
I mean, no one's ever
gonna take him seriously,

39:45.511 --> 39:47.087
but he's really talented.

39:48.011 --> 39:49.618
I, uh, I wanted
to say thank you

39:49.706 --> 39:51.681
for helping me out
with those tickets.

39:51.961 --> 39:53.297
I liked it.

39:53.556 --> 39:55.009
‐ What?
‐ I mean, I know

39:55.097 --> 39:56.977
whatever your dad's into,
it's fucked up, right?

39:57.086 --> 39:59.274
And I like being in on
that fixer shit.

39:59.369 --> 40:00.704
It's not that great.

40:00.792 --> 40:02.393
Well, I need some more
danger in my life.

40:02.636 --> 40:04.337
You think
that's what you want?

40:08.891 --> 40:10.056
Come here.

40:12.834 --> 40:14.399
Come here.
Listen to this.

40:27.119 --> 40:28.859
I think The Hollies
and Radiohead

40:28.947 --> 40:31.687
already made that one.
‐ No!

40:31.775 --> 40:33.455
Oh... no!

40:33.543 --> 40:34.596
Yeah.

40:34.684 --> 40:36.525
‐ God damn it!
‐

40:36.935 --> 40:38.549
‐ Ohh...
‐ Yeah.

40:39.388 --> 40:40.908
- ‐ Uh‐hmm.
- ‐

40:41.471 --> 40:42.761
What is it,
"The Air That I Breathe"?

40:42.848 --> 40:44.385
- ‐ Mm‐hmm.

on the rocks, please.

42:28.913 --> 42:30.135
Yes, sir.

42:32.150 --> 42:34.822
I was surprised
to get your text.

42:48.865 --> 42:50.575
You lived across
the street

42:50.658 --> 42:53.216
from the house
that burned down, right?

42:54.741 --> 42:56.136
‐ Yeah.
‐ The Murphys.

42:56.224 --> 42:58.646
‐ Yeah.
‐ Yeah, you were right next to

42:58.734 --> 43:00.130
the Goodwill.

43:01.659 --> 43:02.916
‐ Yeah.
‐ Yeah,

43:03.004 --> 43:05.888
my mother bought so much
shit from that place,

43:06.178 --> 43:08.997
my brother thought
Goodwill was a brand name.

43:33.158 --> 43:34.357
My sister...

43:35.388 --> 43:37.583
she really say
all those things about me?

43:39.411 --> 43:40.466
What?

43:40.626 --> 43:42.310
That I was the best person
she knew.

43:43.966 --> 43:45.240
Yes.

43:46.185 --> 43:47.552
Why?

43:50.583 --> 43:52.161
Doesn't sound like her.

43:52.637 --> 43:54.622
You were the best
person she knew.

43:54.710 --> 43:56.378
I was there.

43:58.193 --> 44:00.247
Did you think
I was making it up?

44:06.741 --> 44:07.741
I should go.

44:10.475 --> 44:12.724
Stay for another drink.
I mean...

44:15.049 --> 44:16.342
Ray.

44:19.223 --> 44:20.808
Thank you.

44:59.871 --> 45:01.113
Where you been?

45:03.846 --> 45:06.058
I gave Molly Sullivan
the camera.

45:07.665 --> 45:09.228
Well, Feratti's
gonna come after you

45:09.316 --> 45:10.798
with everything he's got now.

45:12.850 --> 45:14.018
Yeah.

45:15.066 --> 45:16.888
What, you don't care?

45:19.199 --> 45:21.222
I don't wanna do it
anymore.

45:27.947 --> 45:29.406
Ray...

45:35.323 --> 45:37.909
Shake my hand.

45:39.392 --> 45:40.478
Why?

45:42.329 --> 45:43.963
Because I'm leaving.

45:51.443 --> 45:53.236
It's time.

45:57.736 --> 45:59.220
Yeah.
