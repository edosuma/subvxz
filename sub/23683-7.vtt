WEBVTT

00:01.002 --> 00:02.420
<i>Previously on</i> Homeland...

00:02.504 --> 00:05.256
We always assumed Simone would
run to David Wellington.

00:05.340 --> 00:06.800
<i>And when she did,
it confirmed our suspicions.</i>

00:06.883 --> 00:08.259
But what if that was
our mistake,

00:08.343 --> 00:10.845
designing an operation with
a predetermined result in mind?

00:10.929 --> 00:12.764
What if it isn't
David Wellington at all?

00:12.847 --> 00:14.933
What if her contact
is someone else?

00:15.016 --> 00:17.936
- What do you want?
<i>- Yevgeny Gromov.</i>

00:18.019 --> 00:20.480
<i>Lucasville-- fake news
that sparked the massacre.</i>

00:20.563 --> 00:23.233
<i>You think that was
Yevgeny's handiwork?</i>

00:23.316 --> 00:25.568
- I do.
- And you want me
to help find him?

00:25.652 --> 00:26.653
I do.

00:26.736 --> 00:30.156
I had an ex
who was bipolar.

00:30.240 --> 00:31.700
Is that why you broke up?

00:31.783 --> 00:33.952
We broke up 'cause
I drank too much.

00:34.035 --> 00:38.456
On March 30, I was told to
withdraw money from these places

00:38.540 --> 00:40.125
and leave it in Hazelton.

00:40.208 --> 00:43.545
- We need to know who this is.
- A senior White House official.

00:43.628 --> 00:45.964
<i>You mean
David Wellington.</i>

00:46.047 --> 00:47.966
- Simone is lying.
- What are you talking about?

00:48.049 --> 00:50.343
She's full of shit,
and they are this close

00:50.427 --> 00:51.970
to giving her immunity,
which means they want her

00:52.053 --> 00:53.263
to testify in open hearing.

00:53.346 --> 00:55.014
At that point, the damage
to the presidency is done.

00:55.098 --> 00:57.267
Whoever's bankrolling
this woman also wants

00:57.350 --> 00:59.477
McClendon's murder pinned
on the White House.

00:59.561 --> 01:01.896
Tell me. How'd you find out
she was in West Virginia

01:01.980 --> 01:03.481
- in the first place?
- She got a parking ticket there.

01:03.565 --> 01:04.983
No, I mean, who brought it
to your attention?

01:05.066 --> 01:06.651
<i>- Dante did.
- You say you're old friends.</i>

01:06.735 --> 01:08.611
The two of you just bumped
into each other by chance?

01:08.695 --> 01:10.572
When was this?

01:13.950 --> 01:16.411
Right after
I got fired by Keane.

01:16.494 --> 01:18.621
Interesting coincidence.

01:21.040 --> 01:22.751
Oh, God. Oh, my God.

01:22.834 --> 01:25.670
- Oh, my God. Fuck me.
- Fuck me.

01:25.754 --> 01:27.422
- Take a breath, Carrie.
- What I need to do

01:27.505 --> 01:28.840
- is nail that fucker.
- Lay low.

01:28.923 --> 01:30.967
Just don't communicate with
him under any circumstances.

01:38.391 --> 01:40.185
You're okay.

02:00.079 --> 02:02.373
<i>He saved our lives.</i>

02:02.457 --> 02:03.875
<i>Yeah.</i>

02:03.958 --> 02:08.213
<i>What was his name?</i>

02:08.296 --> 02:11.841
<i>Carrie, you're not yourself.</i>

02:11.925 --> 02:14.344
<i>You don't have
my condition.</i>

02:14.427 --> 02:16.930
<i>I'm dealing with it.
I-I've been dealing with it</i>

02:17.013 --> 02:18.598
<i>since I was 22.</i>

02:20.183 --> 02:23.770
<i>She said no one at work
could know. She's bipolar.</i>

02:23.853 --> 02:26.356
<i>The mood of the country,
it's not great.</i>

02:27.732 --> 02:30.360
<i>Civil... war!</i>

02:30.443 --> 02:32.570
<i>Madam President, please!</i>

02:32.654 --> 02:35.532
<i>You have to put a stop to this!</i>

02:35.615 --> 02:37.784
<i>It's only getting worse.</i>

02:37.867 --> 02:39.786
<i>Is there no fucking line?</i>

02:39.869 --> 02:44.165
<i>Ridiculous lies
and accusations.</i>

02:47.001 --> 02:50.255
<i>The White House
is in crisis mode.</i>

02:50.338 --> 02:54.050
<i>I'm talking
about information warfare.</i>

02:54.133 --> 02:57.053
<i>Our country
is under attack.</i>

02:58.513 --> 03:01.933
<i>The time to rise up is now!</i>

03:03.560 --> 03:06.813
<i>I swore an oath
to protect it.</i>

03:09.148 --> 03:11.276
<i>Just think of me
as a light on the heavens,</i>

03:11.359 --> 03:17.031
<i>a beacon, steering you clear
of the wrongs.</i>

04:45.370 --> 04:48.164
What happened to
12 hours out cold, guaranteed?

04:48.247 --> 04:50.124
- I don't think he saw anything.
- Yeah, he did.

04:50.208 --> 04:52.043
He saw Stein's ugly face,
which, lucky for us,

04:52.126 --> 04:54.295
sent him straight back
into unconsciousness.

04:54.379 --> 04:56.339
I don't know about you,
but I wasn't done yet.

04:56.422 --> 04:58.341
- Me either.
- I got all the downloads.

04:58.424 --> 04:59.842
Yeah? Well, let's hope
you got something,

04:59.926 --> 05:01.177
'cause so far, we got nothing.

05:01.260 --> 05:03.179
I gotta figure out a way
to get us back in there.

05:03.262 --> 05:04.639
Or not. Look,
that's the kind of shit

05:04.722 --> 05:07.266
you get away with once, at most.
Anyone want breakfast?

05:07.350 --> 05:11.145
Yeah, sure. Oh, fuck!
I've gotta get home.

05:11.229 --> 05:14.357
My sister's gonna kill me.
Fuck.

05:39.799 --> 05:41.342
Can I come in?

05:41.426 --> 05:44.470
Actually, I was
just on my way out.

05:57.692 --> 05:59.736
So what is it?

05:59.819 --> 06:02.238
- Where'd you meet Simone Martin?
- Look, Saul--

06:02.321 --> 06:04.615
Indulge me.

06:06.242 --> 06:10.955
We met at a conference,
in Budapest four years ago.

06:11.039 --> 06:13.458
- What kind of conference?
- A conference.

06:15.501 --> 06:17.837
"Preparing Candidates
for Democracy."

06:17.920 --> 06:20.465
We were on a panel together.

06:20.548 --> 06:22.300
And?

06:23.760 --> 06:26.095
It was the only event
we made it to all week.

06:26.179 --> 06:29.390
We spent the rest
of the time in her room.

06:31.017 --> 06:32.268
Can we sit down?

06:32.351 --> 06:34.896
Saul, how-how long
is this gonna take?

06:34.979 --> 06:38.066
- I got an 8:00 I gotta get to.
- I really think you'll
want to sit down.

06:56.751 --> 06:58.461
Simone Martin is
scheduled to testify

06:58.544 --> 07:00.838
in front of Paley's committee
in three days.

07:00.922 --> 07:02.590
Yeah, and I swear to God,

07:02.673 --> 07:05.885
I have no idea what
she's even gonna say.

07:07.470 --> 07:09.180
I believe you...

07:10.973 --> 07:14.435
...because I do know what
she's going to say.

07:15.895 --> 07:18.981
She will say, under oath,

07:19.065 --> 07:23.945
that you gave her $50,000

07:24.028 --> 07:27.365
as payment for the murder
of General McClendon.

07:27.448 --> 07:30.868
That's bullshit.

07:30.952 --> 07:32.703
I know.

07:32.787 --> 07:36.082
Why?

07:36.165 --> 07:38.167
Why is she doing this
to me?

07:39.794 --> 07:42.088
So we're clear...

07:42.171 --> 07:45.174
<i>She</i> is not doing it
to <i>you.</i>

07:45.258 --> 07:49.137
Simone Martin is an agent
of the Russian government.

07:49.220 --> 07:51.556
A what?

07:51.639 --> 07:56.185
An agent of Russian
military intelligence,

07:56.269 --> 07:58.271
the G.R.U.

07:58.354 --> 08:02.733
Her testimony is an effort
to topple this administration.

08:04.944 --> 08:08.406
I've been involved
with a Russian agent?

08:08.489 --> 08:11.826
Almost certainly.

08:13.703 --> 08:16.289
Which is why I need
your complete cooperation.

08:18.916 --> 08:21.169
What I just told you
is currently a theory.

08:22.503 --> 08:24.922
We need it to become
a fact.

08:27.592 --> 08:30.553
Everything you know
about Simone Martin

08:30.636 --> 08:34.849
that might conceivably
be relevant, tell me.

08:37.727 --> 08:38.853
David.

08:43.149 --> 08:44.734
David.

08:55.745 --> 08:57.788
- Said what?
- Dad.

08:57.872 --> 09:01.250
That doesn't
sound like me.
Is that...

09:01.334 --> 09:03.586
Hey. What's for breakfast?

09:04.462 --> 09:05.713
I'm making eggs.

09:05.796 --> 09:07.215
- Can I help?
- We got it.

09:07.298 --> 09:09.634
- Fresh orange juice, maybe?
- Yeah, we got that, too.

09:09.717 --> 09:12.345
Jos, take over.

09:14.388 --> 09:15.932
- What's this about?
- You know,

09:16.015 --> 09:17.642
you say that you're
tired of having

09:17.725 --> 09:19.685
the same conversation
over and over,

09:19.769 --> 09:21.938
but from what you do, it must
be your great joy in life.

09:22.021 --> 09:24.649
- Believe me, it's not.
- You're not a child.

09:24.732 --> 09:26.984
- I know.
- You had your bad girl years.
It's time to grow out of them.

09:27.068 --> 09:30.613
- You know what? Fuck you.
- Really? You're really
gonna go there?

09:30.696 --> 09:32.406
We had no idea
where you were all night.

09:32.490 --> 09:35.534
- I told you, Franny worries.
- So tell her I'm fine.

09:35.618 --> 09:37.828
- I don't know that.
- Look, you say

09:37.912 --> 09:39.664
- I should work...
- I said get a job.

09:39.747 --> 09:42.250
- ...so I work.
- This... is not working,

09:42.333 --> 09:44.961
- in any sense of the word.
- Yeah, for me either.

09:45.044 --> 09:47.004
Well, why don't you
think about that,

09:47.088 --> 09:48.923
whether you actually wanna be
a part of this family or not?

09:49.006 --> 09:50.800
Because you know what?
We have had it,

09:50.883 --> 09:53.469
all of us,
including your daughter.

10:01.769 --> 10:04.272
- Are you okay?
- Where was she?

10:04.355 --> 10:06.065
I don't know, sweetie.

10:06.148 --> 10:08.150
Why doesn't she like
to be here?

10:08.234 --> 10:09.652
I don't know that either.

10:11.696 --> 10:15.783
Your mom is, uh, under
a lot of pressure at work.

10:15.866 --> 10:17.159
What work?

10:17.243 --> 10:19.787
We're going.

10:19.870 --> 10:23.040
- No, you're not.
- Franny, put your coat on.

10:23.124 --> 10:24.875
- That's not the deal.
- What deal? There is no deal.

10:24.959 --> 10:27.878
- She's my daughter, not yours.
- You don't want to do this.

10:27.962 --> 10:30.047
Oh, everything's secret now?
Like it's suddenly too upsetting

10:30.131 --> 10:32.383
to talk out loud? You drag me
from the kitchen...

10:32.466 --> 10:34.844
- She didn't drag you.
- You know what?
You're-you're right.

10:34.927 --> 10:36.178
She didn't literally drag me.

10:36.262 --> 10:38.431
Thanks very much,
Mr. I've Had It.

10:38.514 --> 10:41.017
Thanks for the hospitality.
You've served your time.

10:41.100 --> 10:44.103
Where will you go?

11:21.474 --> 11:24.101
Get off of me!

11:25.770 --> 11:27.980
Promise you won't yell?

11:33.944 --> 11:37.114
So where you been
all night?

11:37.198 --> 11:39.575
- Out.
- With Carrie?

11:41.869 --> 11:44.872
She told me about
the surveillance, Max.

11:46.415 --> 11:47.750
What surveillance?

11:47.833 --> 11:50.628
The surveillance you put
in at Wellington's

11:50.711 --> 11:53.672
and I just took out.
The surveillance that

11:53.756 --> 11:57.176
let you know Simone Martin
is running some kind of scam.

11:59.720 --> 12:03.349
I told Carrie to back off,
let me handle it now, but...

12:03.432 --> 12:04.934
that's not her way.

12:06.644 --> 12:08.229
So I thought
I'd check in with you

12:08.312 --> 12:10.773
before you both end up
in prison.

12:10.856 --> 12:13.442
I can't believe
she told you.

12:13.526 --> 12:16.737
In case you haven't noticed,
she isn't the most reliable.

12:20.116 --> 12:22.243
So where were you?

12:22.326 --> 12:25.329
- At Dante's apartment.
- With Carrie.

12:25.413 --> 12:28.082
- Yeah.
- Where was Dante?

12:28.165 --> 12:29.500
Sleeping.

12:29.583 --> 12:33.504
What'd you find there
while he was, uh, sleeping?

12:35.047 --> 12:37.591
I don't know.
I downloaded a bunch of stuff,

12:37.675 --> 12:40.010
but I haven't had time
to go through it yet.

12:40.094 --> 12:42.471
Good. We'll do that now,

12:42.555 --> 12:44.890
somewhere I can
keep an eye on you.

12:44.974 --> 12:48.018
Let's go.

13:23.262 --> 13:24.763
All right.

13:37.943 --> 13:40.821
- Hi. Uh, just one night.
- It's six hours till check-in.

13:40.905 --> 13:42.948
I'll have to charge you
an extra half-day.

13:43.032 --> 13:45.075
Fine, just... Fine.

13:45.159 --> 13:46.994
- I'm hungry.
- Well, let's put our stuff

13:47.077 --> 13:48.704
in the room,
then we'll find a place to eat.

13:48.787 --> 13:51.081
I can't put my stuff in
the room. We didn't bring it.

13:51.165 --> 13:53.334
Mom?

13:53.417 --> 13:56.754
- What?
- What's a "mo-tel"?

13:56.837 --> 13:59.089
It's a place like this.
It means "motor hotel,"

13:59.173 --> 14:00.633
because you drive there.

14:00.716 --> 14:04.553
We went to a hotel in Richmond.
We drove there.

14:04.637 --> 14:07.973
Ma'am, your credit card's
been declined.

14:08.057 --> 14:11.852
- Well, can you try it again?
- I already did.

14:11.936 --> 14:14.730
Uh... fine. Uh, sorry.

14:14.813 --> 14:16.899
Uh... here.

14:17.942 --> 14:19.985
Now I'm confused.

14:20.069 --> 14:23.113
Are you Carrie Mathison
or Karen Harris?

14:27.034 --> 14:29.119
You know what? Thank you
very much. We're good.

14:29.203 --> 14:31.163
I'm hungry.

14:31.247 --> 14:32.998
Come on, let's go.

14:45.177 --> 14:46.720
All right,
fasten your seat belt.

14:46.804 --> 14:48.389
- Where are we going?
- I don't know.

14:48.472 --> 14:51.350
- It was just a question.
- Well, isn't it obvious, Franny?

14:51.433 --> 14:53.102
I don't know, I don't know,
I don't know.

15:02.945 --> 15:04.697
Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry.

15:04.780 --> 15:06.824
I was just asking.

15:06.907 --> 15:10.077
I know, I know. Look,
I was up all night working.

15:10.160 --> 15:14.331
Okay? I'm just really,
really tired. Okay?

15:14.415 --> 15:17.334
Okay.

15:17.418 --> 15:21.964
- Sweetie.
- I wanna go home.

15:30.639 --> 15:32.683
Okay, I'm gonna be right back.
Right back.

15:38.897 --> 15:40.983
- Hey.
<i>- So, uh...</i>

15:41.066 --> 15:44.862
what exactly
happened last night?

15:47.281 --> 15:49.700
Exactly? You passed out.

15:49.783 --> 15:52.703
Yeah, well, before that.

15:52.786 --> 15:55.080
We had some drinks.

15:55.164 --> 15:57.750
<i>Yeah, well, after that.
Last thing I remember,</i>

15:57.833 --> 16:00.878
we were coming home together,
heading for the couch.

16:00.961 --> 16:02.713
Now I wake up alone,

16:02.796 --> 16:05.007
the mother
of all headaches...

16:05.090 --> 16:06.467
And I'm not sure. Did we...

16:06.550 --> 16:09.094
What? Did we do it?

16:09.178 --> 16:12.264
<i>- Well?</i>
- If we had,

16:12.348 --> 16:14.224
you would've remembered.
Believe me.

16:14.308 --> 16:16.518
So, no.

16:16.602 --> 16:17.895
No. Definitely no.

16:17.978 --> 16:19.855
You don't have to say it
like that.

16:19.938 --> 16:24.193
I'm sorry. That-that wasn't you.
That was...

16:24.276 --> 16:26.195
<i>What?</i>

16:28.781 --> 16:30.741
Honestly? It's just...

16:30.824 --> 16:32.242
been a rough morning.

16:32.326 --> 16:33.827
You okay?

16:33.911 --> 16:37.039
Not really. I had
a big blowout with my sister.

16:37.122 --> 16:39.083
The one you live with.

16:39.166 --> 16:40.918
Not anymore.

16:41.001 --> 16:43.253
I very dramatically
grabbed Franny by the hand

16:43.337 --> 16:45.214
and said we were out of there

16:45.297 --> 16:46.423
and then dragged her
to this motel,

16:46.507 --> 16:48.717
where my credit card
just got declined.

16:48.801 --> 16:50.302
Meanwhile, my daughter's
gonna kill me

16:50.386 --> 16:52.554
<i>if I don't get her
breakfast soon.</i>

16:52.638 --> 16:55.724
Well, come on over.

16:55.808 --> 17:00.062
Seriously, come on over.

17:00.145 --> 17:01.855
I make excellent pancakes.

17:23.127 --> 17:27.089
Wait here. This way.

17:27.172 --> 17:28.424
Over here.

17:40.227 --> 17:44.106
Close it.

17:58.203 --> 17:59.830
In here.

18:05.627 --> 18:07.755
Max, stay.

18:10.507 --> 18:12.134
Don't worry about them.

18:12.217 --> 18:13.635
What is this place?

18:13.719 --> 18:15.471
Don't worry
about that either.

18:15.554 --> 18:17.639
Max.

18:19.224 --> 18:21.518
Here's what I want you
to do.

18:21.602 --> 18:23.729
Those downloads
you got at Dante's?

18:23.812 --> 18:26.482
Start going through them.
Find anything interesting,

18:26.565 --> 18:31.153
you tell me. Not Carrie.
Me. We clear?

18:32.613 --> 18:36.200
I'm gonna need
an Internet connection.

18:36.283 --> 18:39.203
Okay, fine,
I'll get you one.

18:39.286 --> 18:41.580
So we're clear...

18:41.663 --> 18:45.292
you abuse that,
or anything here...

18:45.375 --> 18:48.086
you fuck me even this much,

18:48.170 --> 18:49.713
I will personally
convince a judge

18:49.797 --> 18:53.050
that the surveillance you snuck
into Wellington's house

18:53.133 --> 18:57.429
constitutes the biggest national
security threat since 9/11.

18:59.431 --> 19:01.225
Got that?

19:01.308 --> 19:03.769
Get to work.

19:05.437 --> 19:06.897
- Who's that?
- Max.

19:06.980 --> 19:08.690
What-What's-What's his skill
set?

19:08.774 --> 19:10.943
Irritant.
He's working with Carrie.

19:11.026 --> 19:12.319
Your Carrie? Mathison?

19:12.402 --> 19:14.988
If you're implying I have
any control over her, then no.

19:15.072 --> 19:17.616
They might be on to something,
he and Carrie might.
I want him to work that

19:17.699 --> 19:19.827
while the two of you
take a look at this--

19:19.910 --> 19:23.247
David Wellington's meditations
on his girlfriend Simone.

19:23.330 --> 19:26.166
Everything he thinks might
help us connect her to Russia.

19:26.250 --> 19:27.918
So you dropped the bomb
on him.

19:28.001 --> 19:30.671
- Yeah.
- How'd he react?

19:30.754 --> 19:33.131
He had no idea.

19:33.215 --> 19:36.176
It's priority.

19:36.260 --> 19:39.388
We have less than three days.

19:44.184 --> 19:47.688
Wait.

19:47.771 --> 19:49.606
A frown?

19:49.690 --> 19:52.317
Seriously? A frown?

19:52.401 --> 19:55.237
In my house?

19:55.320 --> 19:57.614
Well...

19:57.698 --> 20:00.701
I'm going for a smile.

20:00.784 --> 20:03.912
"S"... "M"...

20:03.996 --> 20:07.916
"I"... "L"...

20:08.000 --> 20:10.419
"E."

20:10.502 --> 20:11.587
There.

20:11.670 --> 20:14.756
Hey, keep an eye on those.
They're ours.

20:14.840 --> 20:16.967
Don't let anyone mess
with 'em.

20:20.804 --> 20:23.682
- You've done this before.
- My ex has a niece.

20:23.765 --> 20:28.437
I have two nieces and her,
and I'm clueless.

20:28.520 --> 20:30.939
You know you're welcome
to stay here, right?

20:31.023 --> 20:33.901
While you're, uh,
on the lam.

20:33.984 --> 20:35.986
We're not in the way?

20:36.069 --> 20:40.324
Not at all. In fact,
I got a meeting to get to.

20:41.533 --> 20:43.577
- Wait, you're not staying?
- You'll be fine.

20:43.660 --> 20:46.538
There's an extra key
by the front door.

20:46.622 --> 20:49.666
I'm sure you can find
whatever you need.

20:49.750 --> 20:52.961
- They're ready!
- All yours.

20:54.755 --> 20:57.549
- Bye, Franny.
- Bye.

21:02.429 --> 21:05.474
There have been nearly
a hundred requests for comments.

21:05.557 --> 21:08.185
I am not commenting
on a TMZ video.

21:08.268 --> 21:09.853
Then they'll just go
to Wellington.

21:09.937 --> 21:12.314
Well, if they find him,
maybe they can let me know

21:12.397 --> 21:15.317
- where the hell he's hiding.
- Oh, no.

21:15.400 --> 21:17.861
He's been trying
to talk to me all week.

21:17.945 --> 21:19.696
You want me
to run interference?

21:19.780 --> 21:22.199
No, but interrupt us
after three minutes.

21:23.784 --> 21:26.119
Mr. Vice President.

21:26.203 --> 21:28.914
- Ma'am.
- Please.

21:30.290 --> 21:33.460
I know you have been
asking to see me.

21:33.543 --> 21:35.921
It has just been
a crazy few days.

21:36.004 --> 21:37.464
Well, that's why I'm here--

21:37.547 --> 21:40.133
find out what's going on
with Mr. Wellington.

21:40.217 --> 21:43.178
- You mean the video.
- I don't care about that.

21:43.261 --> 21:45.555
He wants to make a scene,
let him.

21:45.639 --> 21:47.808
I mean the immunity deal.

21:47.891 --> 21:49.935
That woman they're calling
his girlfriend--

21:50.018 --> 21:52.771
- Simone Martin.
- Yes, well, Ms. Martin

21:52.854 --> 21:56.566
has been granted immunity
to testify against him.

21:56.650 --> 21:58.944
That's true.

21:59.027 --> 22:00.821
So?

22:00.904 --> 22:05.033
Will he be charged with
high crimes and misdemeanors?

22:05.117 --> 22:09.705
Will the walls of this
White House come tumbling down?

22:09.788 --> 22:11.623
I have a right to know,
Madam President,

22:11.707 --> 22:16.086
because if
this administration falls,

22:16.169 --> 22:18.797
it falls on me.

22:18.880 --> 22:23.176
Okay, Ralph, let's talk
normally a minute.

22:25.804 --> 22:29.224
You asked about what's going on
with Mr. Wellington.

22:29.307 --> 22:30.809
Nothing is going on
with him.

22:30.892 --> 22:32.310
Oh.

22:32.394 --> 22:35.397
He has no idea what she could
possibly be testifying to.

22:35.480 --> 22:39.359
- He has assured me of that.
- And you believe him.

22:39.443 --> 22:41.361
Absolutely.

22:41.445 --> 22:44.364
And you should, too.

22:44.448 --> 22:46.533
I'm sure you come in here
wanting to help,

22:46.616 --> 22:49.661
but you have to understand
that what you're actually doing

22:49.745 --> 22:52.289
is helping Paley,
because what you just said,

22:52.372 --> 22:57.044
"My God, she's gonna testify.
There must be something there,"

22:57.127 --> 22:59.004
that's his position.

22:59.087 --> 23:02.466
He sows doubt.
That is what he does.

23:02.549 --> 23:04.885
And it is bad enough
when it shows up out there.

23:04.968 --> 23:08.764
But you cannot let it
take root in here.

23:08.847 --> 23:13.101
Ma'am, it's not only me.
There are rumblings.

23:13.185 --> 23:16.396
Well, stop them.
Stop the rumblings.

23:16.480 --> 23:18.065
You want to help, do that,

23:18.148 --> 23:20.358
because now there's going
to be more rumblings

23:20.442 --> 23:23.320
about the fact that you and I
are sitting here together.

23:23.403 --> 23:24.821
Madam President?

23:24.905 --> 23:29.242
- Yes?
- Protocols
for the medal ceremony

23:29.326 --> 23:31.828
at the Virginia War Memorial
this afternoon.

23:31.912 --> 23:34.831
From the bombing raid in Syria?

23:34.915 --> 23:38.710
- I can come back.
- No.

23:38.794 --> 23:42.130
The vice president was
just leaving.

23:45.675 --> 23:48.011
Ralph...

23:48.095 --> 23:51.056
since what you're really asking
is whether you'll be sitting

23:51.139 --> 23:55.685
in this chair anytime soon,
the answer is no.

23:57.020 --> 23:59.397
Ma'am.

24:10.158 --> 24:12.536
- What are you doing?
- Cleaning up.

24:12.619 --> 24:14.830
Still?

24:14.913 --> 24:17.916
Almost done.
Few more minutes.

24:17.999 --> 24:19.918
- Who's this?
- What?

24:20.001 --> 24:22.712
- Who's this?
- Who's who?

24:22.796 --> 24:24.214
Her.

24:29.010 --> 24:30.470
Where'd you find that?

24:30.554 --> 24:32.055
Under the table.

24:32.139 --> 24:36.601
- That's not ours.
- Should I put it back?

24:38.353 --> 24:40.689
That's Dante's wife.

24:40.772 --> 24:42.023
Does she live here?

24:42.107 --> 24:45.360
Uh, no, honey. She's his
ex-wife. They split up.

24:45.443 --> 24:48.530
Why?

24:50.157 --> 24:52.659
You know what? That is
a very good question.

24:57.247 --> 25:00.125
Audrey Navarro.

25:02.502 --> 25:04.171
She works at Treasury.

25:04.254 --> 25:05.922
What's Treasury?

25:06.006 --> 25:09.467
You want to take a ride?
I'll show you.

25:14.514 --> 25:16.349
Hi.

25:16.433 --> 25:20.896
- Hello.
- I'm Dante. Allen.

25:21.980 --> 25:23.815
I guess Carrie didn't
mention me.

25:23.899 --> 25:28.361
Sorry, no, I don't think so.
Anyway, she's not here.

25:28.445 --> 25:31.615
Uh, I know. She's at my house
with Franny.

25:31.698 --> 25:33.491
They're fine.

25:33.575 --> 25:36.912
Well, thanks...
for telling me.

25:36.995 --> 25:39.539
That's good to know.

25:39.623 --> 25:42.626
So you probably heard about
the big blowout this morning.

25:42.709 --> 25:45.045
Same words.

25:45.128 --> 25:46.588
- Hmm?
- Uh, "big blowout."

25:46.671 --> 25:49.925
Exact same words Carrie
used to describe it.

25:50.008 --> 25:52.052
Like I said, though,
they're-they're fine.

25:52.135 --> 25:54.054
Just, uh, traveling
a little light.

25:54.137 --> 25:58.475
I thought Franny wouldn't mind
getting some of her things.

26:00.393 --> 26:01.853
Yeah, come in.

26:19.537 --> 26:21.957
- Karen Harris?
- Yes. Audrey?

26:22.040 --> 26:24.167
You said you had
some questions about Dante.

26:24.251 --> 26:26.628
Just a few.
It won't take long.

26:29.798 --> 26:31.675
So...

26:31.758 --> 26:33.385
what has he done?

26:33.468 --> 26:34.970
Nothing.
He hasn't done anything.

26:35.053 --> 26:37.389
We're vetting him
for a new assignment.

26:37.472 --> 26:39.641
So did you and Carrie
just meet?

26:39.724 --> 26:42.519
No, no. We've, uh... we've
worked together for a while,

26:42.602 --> 26:45.814
- off and on.
- Mm. Are you Agency?

26:45.897 --> 26:48.650
- Am I allowed to ask that?
- Uh, Bureau.

26:48.733 --> 26:50.235
Ah.

26:50.318 --> 26:54.364
So, um, what are you
working on now?

26:54.447 --> 26:57.033
The usual. Security.

26:57.117 --> 27:00.704
Meaning you can't say.

27:02.414 --> 27:04.541
You people have no idea

27:04.624 --> 27:06.793
how frustrating that is
for everyone else.

27:06.876 --> 27:08.378
I apologize.

27:08.461 --> 27:11.047
No, it's, uh, reassuring
to know

27:11.131 --> 27:13.925
she's actually doing something.

27:18.638 --> 27:22.600
- What are you looking for?
- Oh, this stuffed rabbit

27:22.684 --> 27:24.519
I thought Franny would
outgrow by now,

27:24.602 --> 27:26.813
but she's, uh, kind of
doubled down on him.

27:26.896 --> 27:29.357
Think it might be
in Carrie's room?

27:29.441 --> 27:31.609
Maybe, yeah. Down the hall.

27:59.304 --> 28:00.930
Any luck?

28:02.724 --> 28:04.392
Not yet.

28:04.476 --> 28:06.936
Floppy ears, big feet.

28:07.020 --> 28:09.064
You sure she didn't
have him with her?

28:09.147 --> 28:11.316
I think I'd have noticed.

28:11.399 --> 28:13.485
Well,
maybe he's downstairs.

28:24.496 --> 28:27.540
What are you doing?

28:27.624 --> 28:30.460
Is this him?

28:30.543 --> 28:32.420
Which is what I want
to talk to you about.

28:32.504 --> 28:35.256
Your personal issues are yours,
but I-I'd like to hear

28:35.340 --> 28:37.592
what you know about
his work life at the time.

28:37.675 --> 28:40.095
- You mean the whole mess
in Kabul?
- Yeah.

28:40.178 --> 28:42.847
What I know is not a lot.

28:42.931 --> 28:45.934
He was... sent home.

28:46.017 --> 28:49.813
He was not
happy about it at all.

28:49.896 --> 28:51.856
He started...

28:51.940 --> 28:53.191
Drinking.

28:53.274 --> 28:55.902
Drinking? Dante? No.

28:55.985 --> 28:59.322
No, I was gonna say...
obsessing,

28:59.406 --> 29:01.408
but that's
not quite right either.

29:02.617 --> 29:04.577
He was bitter, for sure,

29:04.661 --> 29:06.663
for getting blamed
for something that,

29:06.746 --> 29:08.790
as I understand it,
wasn't his fault.

29:08.873 --> 29:12.210
And... he just wouldn't
let it go.

29:13.628 --> 29:18.133
So in the end, the timing was
just... really bad.

29:18.216 --> 29:20.176
How do you mean?

29:20.260 --> 29:23.263
Because right when I finally
gave up on him and walked out,

29:23.346 --> 29:25.682
the whole Kabul thing
kind of blew over.

29:25.765 --> 29:29.060
He got some new assignment, back
in the game, traveling again.

29:29.144 --> 29:31.020
Where?

29:31.104 --> 29:34.649
You would know more
about that than me.

29:34.732 --> 29:37.026
Overseas somewhere?
He couldn't say.

29:38.611 --> 29:41.865
Anyway, by that time,
we were barely talking.

29:44.784 --> 29:47.245
Well,
this was very helpful.

29:47.328 --> 29:49.622
Thank you.

29:53.793 --> 29:57.547
You know what
really bugged him?

29:57.630 --> 30:00.925
The sheer unfairness
of it all.

30:01.009 --> 30:03.178
'Cause at the same time
he's over there,

30:03.261 --> 30:05.889
trying to bring some sanity
to the situation,

30:05.972 --> 30:09.684
there's this woman,
this CIA station chief,

30:09.767 --> 30:12.270
who was completely
off the rails.

30:12.353 --> 30:15.482
Right around the time he's sent
home from Kabul, total pariah,

30:15.565 --> 30:18.818
this crazy lady drops a drone
on a wedding party,

30:18.902 --> 30:21.362
killing 40 people.
And you know what she gets?

30:21.446 --> 30:23.823
A promotion.

30:25.366 --> 30:26.951
So...

30:27.035 --> 30:29.329
Okay, life's not fair.

30:29.412 --> 30:34.292
I know that.
Maybe you do, too.

30:34.375 --> 30:37.587
But I'm not sure
Dante really does.

30:39.672 --> 30:41.549
He told me she's bipolar.

30:41.633 --> 30:44.552
Well, she's not. She's about
the most stable person on Earth.

30:44.636 --> 30:47.764
He also said he started drinking
heavily-- another lie.

30:47.847 --> 30:50.016
And that he was
chained to a desk stateside

30:50.099 --> 30:51.726
when, according to her,
he was traveling.

30:51.809 --> 30:54.687
- Where was he going?
<i>- She had no idea.</i>

30:54.771 --> 30:56.523
By that point,
she didn't really care.

30:56.606 --> 30:58.525
But-but check out the travel.
It's important.

30:58.608 --> 31:02.111
I think that's when he was
getting recruited.

31:02.195 --> 31:03.863
Max, are you there?

31:03.947 --> 31:06.533
Yeah, I'm here.

31:06.616 --> 31:10.370
Also, there was some crazy,
crazy stuff involving me.

31:10.453 --> 31:11.663
Like what?

31:11.746 --> 31:14.958
I sort of don't know
where to start.

31:15.041 --> 31:16.751
H-How about I come over
with Franny,

31:16.834 --> 31:18.211
<i>and we go over everything
at once?</i>

31:18.294 --> 31:20.713
Now's not a good time.
I'm kind of busy.

31:20.797 --> 31:22.090
<i>With what?</i>

31:22.173 --> 31:26.094
I'll-I'll get back to you
once I find something.

31:26.177 --> 31:30.348
Okay, good. Call.

31:30.431 --> 31:33.643
So where did we park?

31:36.521 --> 31:40.400
- It's not right,
you keeping her in the dark.
- I don't want to discuss it.

31:40.483 --> 31:43.653
Carrie's the one who
told you what's going on.

31:43.736 --> 31:46.239
Is that what she said?

31:46.322 --> 31:48.825
See, I wouldn't
characterize it that way.

31:48.908 --> 31:51.327
Carrie brought me a problem
she couldn't solve,

31:51.411 --> 31:52.829
a problem she created,

31:52.912 --> 31:54.747
because until
she talked to me,

31:54.831 --> 31:57.834
she had gotten everything
exactly backward.

31:57.917 --> 32:01.170
She trusted the wrong people,
used her considerable energies

32:01.254 --> 32:05.341
to help a foreign power
undermine our government.

32:06.718 --> 32:08.970
Doesn't exactly make her
citizen of the month.

32:09.053 --> 32:11.472
Saul?

32:11.556 --> 32:13.808
So sit here and do your work.

32:13.891 --> 32:16.644
Next time she calls,
don't answer.

32:20.481 --> 32:22.400
<i>What is it?</i>

32:22.483 --> 32:23.776
Simone Martin.

32:23.860 --> 32:26.237
We were tracking some of
the names Wellington gave us,

32:26.321 --> 32:28.323
looking for a Russian
connection overseas.

32:28.406 --> 32:30.950
Then it hit us.
Why not look closer to home?

32:31.034 --> 32:33.328
Aristov.

32:33.411 --> 32:34.704
Ligachev.

32:34.787 --> 32:36.289
Kalugin.

32:36.372 --> 32:38.458
- The oligarchs.
- Like this with the Kremlin

32:38.541 --> 32:40.043
and all members of her board.

32:40.126 --> 32:41.586
All three make huge
contributions

32:41.669 --> 32:44.380
to the NGO she works for
through companies they control.

32:44.464 --> 32:46.549
So what are we saying exactly?

32:46.633 --> 32:49.636
Her charity, the International
Democracy Foundation?

32:49.719 --> 32:52.013
It's a Russian front.

32:52.096 --> 32:54.474
Work that up, with all
the supporting materials

32:54.557 --> 32:56.100
you can get your hands on.

32:56.184 --> 33:00.021
Any luck, we can still get it
to a judge this afternoon.

33:00.104 --> 33:01.481
Ladies and gentlemen,

33:01.564 --> 33:04.150
it is an honor to be here
with you all today.

33:04.233 --> 33:06.527
I know you just got home.
You probably want to be off

33:06.611 --> 33:08.571
with your families
and your loved ones,

33:08.655 --> 33:10.531
out of your dress blues,

33:10.615 --> 33:12.825
done with all these awards
and formalities.

33:12.909 --> 33:14.911
And I don't blame you.
I've been there.

33:14.994 --> 33:16.621
President Keane has, too.

33:16.704 --> 33:18.748
We both know what it's like
to be parents...

33:18.831 --> 33:21.584
Madam President. General Rossen
has already spoken.

33:21.668 --> 33:23.753
The vice president
is introducing you now.

33:23.836 --> 33:25.797
Your remarks
are on the teleprompter.

33:25.880 --> 33:27.965
President Keane came up

33:28.049 --> 33:30.885
with one heck of a play here--
a tricky one,

33:30.968 --> 33:35.348
a challenging one--
and she chose you to make it.

33:35.431 --> 33:37.058
Mr. Wellington approved
the text.

33:37.141 --> 33:38.726
Where is he?
Where's David?

33:38.810 --> 33:40.812
Mr. Wellington's not here.

33:40.895 --> 33:42.397
He got me into this.

33:42.480 --> 33:45.024
I haven't seen him all day.
Where is he?

33:45.108 --> 33:46.484
He gave me
something for you.

33:46.567 --> 33:47.819
...you are
the tip of the spear...

33:47.902 --> 33:50.863
He asked that you not read it
until after the event.

33:50.947 --> 33:54.117
...warriors
of the highest caliber.

33:54.200 --> 33:57.662
Fact is, you came through for us
in a very big way...

34:00.707 --> 34:02.166
...your accomplishments on...

34:02.250 --> 34:03.876
Are you okay?

34:03.960 --> 34:06.796
Would you like to sit down?

34:06.879 --> 34:08.715
No.

34:11.509 --> 34:14.637
- Madam President--
- No.

34:25.440 --> 34:27.358
I would like to
introduce someone else

34:27.442 --> 34:29.402
who wants to thank you--

34:29.485 --> 34:32.280
our commander in chief,

34:32.363 --> 34:34.991
President Elizabeth Keane!

35:21.913 --> 35:24.457
This is her,
Your Honor-- Simone Martin.

35:24.540 --> 35:26.834
Doesn't look Russian.

35:26.918 --> 35:29.587
She's a Russian agent.
French national.

35:29.670 --> 35:32.590
Mm, pretty. Nice shape.

35:32.673 --> 35:37.428
These are three Russian
organized crime figures

35:37.512 --> 35:40.139
who sit on the board
of the NGO where she works.

35:40.223 --> 35:42.433
The International Democracy
Foundation.

35:42.517 --> 35:45.061
- So-called.
- She runs it?

35:45.144 --> 35:48.189
She's in charge of fundraising,
which she accomplishes

35:48.272 --> 35:50.983
mainly by laundering money
for these men.

35:52.777 --> 35:54.570
This NGO's a Russian front

35:54.654 --> 35:56.739
which we believe
has been instrumental

35:56.823 --> 36:00.076
in recent active measures
against our country.

36:00.159 --> 36:01.953
- Before you get into that...
- Yes, Your Honor?

36:02.036 --> 36:03.454
Come on, you know what
I'm gonna say.

36:03.538 --> 36:06.207
You're alleging
a sprawling conspiracy.

36:06.290 --> 36:08.251
This woman you got
your sights set on

36:08.334 --> 36:10.378
- is a small piece of that pie.
- We believe she's a--

36:10.461 --> 36:13.047
Yeah, you believe.

36:13.130 --> 36:15.508
You allege. You surmise.

36:15.591 --> 36:17.760
Honestly, I don't know
what you're asking for.

36:17.844 --> 36:19.720
A surveillance order?
An arrest warrant?

36:19.804 --> 36:22.056
I want a writ of mandamus,

36:22.139 --> 36:24.725
allowing me to question her
on her Russian connections

36:24.809 --> 36:28.896
before she testifies in front of
Paley's committee in three days.

36:29.939 --> 36:31.524
Okay, wait.

36:33.651 --> 36:38.239
This, uh, Russian agent,
this is the same woman

36:38.322 --> 36:40.992
who's involved with
the president's chief of staff?

36:41.075 --> 36:42.368
That's correct.

36:42.451 --> 36:45.705
Who he's manhandling
all over the interweb.

36:45.788 --> 36:47.915
She's currently sequestered
by the committee

36:47.999 --> 36:50.334
at a location they're
unwilling to disclose.

36:50.418 --> 36:51.878
Probably for
her own protection.

36:51.961 --> 36:53.880
No, Your Honor,
I don't think so.

36:53.963 --> 36:57.258
Her efforts to damage our
country are not a speculation.

36:57.341 --> 36:59.010
We know what her testimony
will be.

36:59.093 --> 37:00.553
We know
it will not be truthful.

37:00.636 --> 37:02.597
- Then prove that.
- That's why I'm here--

37:02.680 --> 37:05.683
to get a chance to confront her
with these facts.

37:05.766 --> 37:09.186
No. No, no, no.

37:09.270 --> 37:11.939
You get your chance after
she's testified,

37:12.023 --> 37:13.733
after she says
what she's gonna say.

37:13.816 --> 37:15.401
Your Honor,
by then it's too late.

37:15.484 --> 37:17.236
Her lies are given credence
by the fact

37:17.320 --> 37:19.822
she tells them at the Capitol.
There's no way to undo that.

37:19.906 --> 37:21.490
She's not just tainting
Wellington.

37:21.574 --> 37:23.743
We face the real prospect of
the administration collapsing...

37:23.826 --> 37:25.244
- Did you hear me?
- ...due to false claims

37:25.328 --> 37:26.662
- by a foreign operative...
- I said no!

37:26.746 --> 37:28.039
...and a grandstanding senator

37:28.122 --> 37:30.124
who doesn't give a damn
about the truth!

37:30.207 --> 37:32.335
Now you're raising your voice
in my house,

37:32.418 --> 37:35.046
which is offensive to me.

37:36.213 --> 37:38.925
Now, you can call that
a writ of whatever.

37:40.176 --> 37:42.428
What you're asking for
is witness tampering,

37:42.511 --> 37:44.096
and you know it.

37:45.890 --> 37:49.352
Your problem?

37:49.435 --> 37:53.981
It's called politics, which is
why it's such a goddamn mess.

37:55.358 --> 37:58.653
It's also why I have
no intention of intervening,

37:58.736 --> 38:00.988
and nobody else
in this building would either.

38:02.531 --> 38:05.701
Lieutenant Colonel
Thomas Sanborn.

38:08.245 --> 38:10.122
Congratulations.

38:12.166 --> 38:14.877
Major Jeremy Willows.

38:17.254 --> 38:19.048
Congratulations.

38:20.257 --> 38:23.177
Airman First Class
Andrew Yamato.

38:26.263 --> 38:27.765
Congratulations.

38:29.225 --> 38:31.519
Ladies and gentlemen,
follow me.

38:36.857 --> 38:41.362
Ma'am, the photographers
will be ready in a few minutes.

38:52.957 --> 38:56.252
Madam President.

38:56.335 --> 38:59.338
Saul.

38:59.422 --> 39:01.674
I'm at a war memorial,
handing out medals for

39:01.757 --> 39:05.594
an air strike I didn't order,
and you know what I just got?

39:05.678 --> 39:09.223
A resignation letter
from David Wellington.

39:09.306 --> 39:12.560
Three excruciating pages
explaining why he's resigning--

39:12.643 --> 39:16.105
Russians, Russians,
Russians, Russians,

39:16.188 --> 39:18.107
which he says came from you.

39:21.152 --> 39:22.903
So did it?

39:22.987 --> 39:24.613
<i>The Russian connection, yes.</i>

39:24.697 --> 39:28.034
I did not tell him
to resign.

39:28.117 --> 39:30.453
But should he?

39:30.536 --> 39:32.580
<i>No state secrets
were compromised.</i>

39:32.663 --> 39:34.874
Beyond that,
it's really up to you.

39:38.127 --> 39:41.672
This is what you were trying to
tell me the other day, isn't it?

39:41.756 --> 39:44.717
When we lost control of
the situation in Lucasville.

39:46.469 --> 39:48.304
Yes.

39:48.387 --> 39:51.098
They're trying to destroy me.

39:51.182 --> 39:54.435
<i>All respect, ma'am, they're
trying to destroy the country.</i>

39:54.518 --> 39:56.687
<i>Used to be from
Saint Petersburg and Moscow.</i>

39:56.771 --> 39:58.731
Now it's from
Pennsylvania Avenue,

39:58.814 --> 40:00.357
three blocks
from the White House.

40:00.441 --> 40:02.693
<i>That's where she works,
this woman who will be</i>

40:02.777 --> 40:06.280
<i>- testifying against Wellington.</i>
- That can't happen.

40:06.363 --> 40:07.656
<i>I agree.</i>

40:07.740 --> 40:09.408
I've started a task force.

40:09.492 --> 40:11.494
Just a few trusted people
so far.

40:11.577 --> 40:13.996
Russian experts,
not from any single agency.

40:14.080 --> 40:15.915
We've already built
what I believe is

40:15.998 --> 40:18.167
a compelling case
against her.

40:18.250 --> 40:19.376
And?

40:19.460 --> 40:21.003
<i>Federal judge disagreed.</i>

40:21.087 --> 40:24.757
At least, he wasn't willing
to intervene.

40:24.840 --> 40:27.176
Is there anything
I can do to help?

40:27.259 --> 40:31.555
If there were, believe me,
I'd let you know.

40:50.950 --> 40:54.036
Just had a bad conversation
with a federal judge,

40:54.120 --> 40:57.998
followed by a truly terrible
conversation with the president.

40:58.082 --> 41:01.919
So... recess is over.
Max, back to your desk.

41:02.002 --> 41:03.170
Saul.

41:03.254 --> 41:04.380
What?

41:04.463 --> 41:06.048
He may have found
something.

41:06.132 --> 41:08.968
- What is it?
- Something Carrie said,

41:09.051 --> 41:13.013
about Dante's trips overseas--
to take a look at them,

41:13.097 --> 41:14.640
so I did,
while they were looking

41:14.723 --> 41:18.727
at where Simone was traveling,
raising money, supposedly.

41:18.811 --> 41:20.229
Yeah. And?

41:22.314 --> 41:24.775
Five points of congruence--

41:24.859 --> 41:28.696
Riga, Dubrovnik,
Belgrad, Berat,

41:28.779 --> 41:31.323
Sofia.

41:31.407 --> 41:33.617
Same time, same place.

41:33.701 --> 41:36.453
We got what we could on Simone.
Is there more? Probably.

41:36.537 --> 41:40.040
But how quickly we can develop
that is anyone's guess.

41:40.124 --> 41:43.919
If you need to talk
to someone now...

41:44.003 --> 41:46.547
Go after Dante.

41:52.261 --> 41:54.930
Hop!

41:55.014 --> 41:58.267
Thank you!
Thank you! Thank you!

41:59.727 --> 42:01.312
You're very welcome.

42:07.109 --> 42:10.196
Well?

42:10.279 --> 42:12.114
What?

42:12.198 --> 42:14.533
Are you gonna thank me?

42:14.617 --> 42:17.786
Honestly, the first thing that
comes to mind isn't "Thanks."

42:17.870 --> 42:19.538
It's more, "I don't appreciate
you going to my sister's

42:19.622 --> 42:22.124
- behind my back."
- Wow.

42:22.208 --> 42:25.127
I thought you had some some
big meeting you had to get to.

42:25.211 --> 42:28.589
Yeah,
I picked these up after.

42:28.672 --> 42:33.093
Look... I just thought
Franny'd be more comfortable.

42:33.177 --> 42:34.637
Franny's not your concern.

42:34.720 --> 42:36.180
Mom?

42:37.598 --> 42:40.267
I really don't know how I got
to be the bad guy here.

42:40.351 --> 42:42.102
Well, think about it.

42:42.186 --> 42:45.105
Mom.

42:47.858 --> 42:50.027
Don't.

43:44.164 --> 43:46.959
Ma'am?

43:47.042 --> 43:49.628
We're five minutes out.

43:50.879 --> 43:52.381
Roger?

43:52.464 --> 43:56.427
I'd like to stop at
Mr. Wellington's on the way.

44:06.103 --> 44:08.605
Oh! Sorry. Too high?

44:08.689 --> 44:12.026
- Better?
- Better.

44:12.109 --> 44:14.445
One night. One.

44:14.528 --> 44:15.988
Then what?

44:16.071 --> 44:17.489
School tomorrow.

44:17.573 --> 44:18.741
Then what?

44:18.824 --> 44:21.285
Don't you worry about that.
Okay?

44:21.368 --> 44:24.038
Promise me. All right.

44:24.121 --> 44:27.416
Now close your eyes.

44:27.499 --> 44:28.959
Mwah.

44:29.043 --> 44:32.880
I'll be back
before you know it. Okay?

44:32.963 --> 44:35.632
Close 'em.

44:58.030 --> 45:01.700
- She good?
- Yeah.

45:01.784 --> 45:04.828
You?

45:04.912 --> 45:07.664
You really didn't have to
give us your room.

45:07.748 --> 45:10.834
I'll survive.

45:13.337 --> 45:14.671
Peace?

45:17.007 --> 45:18.717
Yes? No?

45:21.220 --> 45:22.596
Yes.

45:28.519 --> 45:31.063
- So what'd she say?
- Who?

45:31.146 --> 45:34.775
- Who do you think?
- My sister.

45:34.858 --> 45:36.985
Oh, come on.
You were spying on me.

45:37.069 --> 45:39.822
- Spying?
- Yeah. So what'd she say?

45:42.157 --> 45:44.618
- Not much.
- Really?

45:44.701 --> 45:46.537
She's very discreet.

45:46.620 --> 45:48.831
Probably learned that
from you.

45:48.914 --> 45:51.458
She was grilling me.

45:51.542 --> 45:54.586
I do think she's worried
about you.

45:54.670 --> 45:58.090
She, uh,
said she was relieved

45:58.173 --> 46:01.510
to know you were actually
doing something...

46:01.593 --> 46:03.679
with me.

46:09.685 --> 46:11.562
What did Audrey say?

46:12.896 --> 46:16.608
She called after you left,
congratulate me on the new job.

46:16.692 --> 46:19.445
Fingers crossed,
hoped she said the right things.

46:19.528 --> 46:22.698
So did she, hmm?

46:24.616 --> 46:26.326
Say the right things?

46:26.410 --> 46:31.373
'Cause, uh, Audrey's
definitely not discreet.

46:33.709 --> 46:38.046
She said she worried
about you back then,

46:38.130 --> 46:41.800
that when things went south in
Kabul, she tried to reach out.

46:41.884 --> 46:44.011
At first, anyway.

46:46.013 --> 46:47.598
But?

46:51.935 --> 46:54.021
She couldn't make it work.

46:59.109 --> 47:00.736
Why not?

47:05.199 --> 47:07.451
She said she gave up.

47:08.911 --> 47:12.956
She gave up? Okay.

47:13.040 --> 47:15.709
What else?

47:17.461 --> 47:19.046
Nothing.

47:19.129 --> 47:21.507
I doubt that.

47:23.175 --> 47:25.052
I don't know what you mean.

47:26.470 --> 47:28.931
I think you do.

47:35.896 --> 47:38.774
She said...

47:38.857 --> 47:43.445
you were preoccupied
with someone else.

47:43.529 --> 47:45.906
Who?

47:51.370 --> 47:53.330
A CIA station chief.

47:55.666 --> 47:57.209
Me.

48:23.318 --> 48:25.445
- I'll just be a minute.
- Yes, ma'am.

48:36.582 --> 48:39.918
I got your letter-- Letters.

48:41.128 --> 48:45.757
This one, "I resign"--
at least I understand.

48:45.841 --> 48:48.969
But this...
"She meant nothing to me..."

48:49.052 --> 48:50.554
"...a relationship
of convenience"?

48:50.637 --> 48:53.473
I thought you should know
before I leave.

48:53.557 --> 48:57.519
- Know what?
- Why I've been here.

48:58.854 --> 49:00.981
No.
No, no, no, no, no, no.

49:01.064 --> 49:03.108
You don't get to do that,

49:03.191 --> 49:07.195
upend everything after
seven years with this-this...

49:07.279 --> 49:11.325
I don't even know what
to call it. This declaration?

49:14.911 --> 49:16.872
I'm the president
of the United States.

49:16.955 --> 49:18.498
- I know.
- You made that happen.

49:18.582 --> 49:20.709
As much as anyone,
you are responsible.

49:20.792 --> 49:22.711
- I am trying to be.
- By resigning?

49:22.794 --> 49:25.881
I am not gonna pull you down.

49:25.964 --> 49:28.800
But I <i>am</i> being pulled down.

49:28.884 --> 49:31.803
Everything
is falling apart.

49:31.887 --> 49:34.890
Everything is disintegrating
all around me.

49:34.973 --> 49:36.350
And what I need now

49:36.433 --> 49:38.727
is for you to be the man
I hired to protect me,

49:38.810 --> 49:40.479
because they are
coming after me,

49:40.562 --> 49:42.773
and you are running away,
and you can't.

49:42.856 --> 49:46.276
You can't do that.

49:47.569 --> 49:49.237
You can't.

49:54.743 --> 49:56.244
I don't accept this.

49:58.997 --> 50:01.124
I don't accept
your resignation.

50:05.629 --> 50:07.506
Ma'am.

50:36.827 --> 50:38.662
We good?

50:38.745 --> 50:41.623
Yeah, she can sleep
through anything.

50:56.680 --> 50:58.098
He's FBI,

50:58.181 --> 51:00.267
spent several years
in counterterrorism overseas.

51:00.350 --> 51:04.146
He'll have his standard issue
sidearm at least, maybe more.

51:04.229 --> 51:07.441
Tread lightly going in.
Surprise is our friend here.

51:07.524 --> 51:08.942
- Hey, sir?
- Yeah?

51:09.025 --> 51:11.737
We may have a problem.

51:13.196 --> 51:15.031
What?

51:15.115 --> 51:18.994
I'm seeing three images.
He's got company.

51:19.077 --> 51:21.496
- Let me see.
- Sir.

51:25.584 --> 51:27.252
She was warned
to stay clear.

51:43.310 --> 51:45.312
You never told me...

51:45.395 --> 51:48.023
why you went to her.

51:58.116 --> 52:00.577
Why you went to Audrey.

52:08.794 --> 52:10.253
Because I think you're--
Aah!

52:10.337 --> 52:12.005
Freeze
and get on the ground!

52:12.088 --> 52:14.299
- On the ground!
- No! No! Wait!

52:14.382 --> 52:16.092
- On the ground!
- Don't move!

52:16.176 --> 52:17.385
Get the fuck off me!

52:17.469 --> 52:21.681
Get the fuck off me!
I'm a federal agent!

52:21.765 --> 52:23.266
It's all right.
I gotcha.
Franny!

52:23.350 --> 52:24.684
Franny!

52:24.768 --> 52:26.853
Up! Up!

52:26.937 --> 52:29.356
- Franny, it's okay.
- Mommy, no!

52:29.439 --> 52:32.359
It's okay.
It's okay, Franny.

52:32.442 --> 52:35.403
Shh.
