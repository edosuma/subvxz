WEBVTT

00:03.171 --> 00:07.756
So, Pizza Pete! How is the day job?

00:07.842 --> 00:11.585
Soul-sucking. Though I do
have an audition tomorrow.

00:11.679 --> 00:12.919
Power tools commercial.

00:13.014 --> 00:15.096
You will nail it.

00:15.183 --> 00:16.844
Do you see what I did there?

00:19.061 --> 00:20.437
This guy up in your grill?

00:20.521 --> 00:24.764
Oh, not yet. But the
night is still very young.

00:24.859 --> 00:27.316
Less blah, more 'za.

00:28.529 --> 00:32.863
And next time, think
double cheese, Phil.

00:32.950 --> 00:35.362
--|t's Pete.
--Whatever.

00:35.453 --> 00:38.741
--And I love you.
--Mm-hm. Bye.

00:44.545 --> 00:46.456
What?

00:46.547 --> 00:48.128
l was getting my flirt on.

00:48.216 --> 00:49.956
With the delivery dude?

00:50.051 --> 00:52.508
--He is an actor.
--Oh, great.

00:52.595 --> 00:54.881
Okay, and I'm pretty sure
his crust is double-stuffed,

00:54.972 --> 00:55.961
if you know what I mean.

00:56.057 --> 00:57.172
Yeah, I wish I didn't.

00:57.266 --> 00:59.302
--|t's so easy for you.
--Why?

00:59.393 --> 01:01.554
| wish I had man slaves
who did whatever I want.

01:01.646 --> 01:03.477
Well, some things are easy for you,

01:03.564 --> 01:06.727
like confusing the table with the sink.

01:06.817 --> 01:09.149
And the laundry hamper.

01:09.237 --> 01:13.321
I'm not the one that leaves
weapons around, okay.

01:13.407 --> 01:15.147
Were you planning
to chop some wood?

01:15.243 --> 01:17.825
That is for protection. Our protection.

01:17.912 --> 01:21.700
Well, consider this "our" laundry.

01:21.791 --> 01:26.080
You know what? This is our
first fight. Our first real fight.

01:26.170 --> 01:28.877
Mazel tov?

01:28.965 --> 01:32.708
It's like we're real-life sisters.

01:32.802 --> 01:35.839
For walking Viagra, you're such a nerd.

01:35.930 --> 01:38.171
Well, not to belabour the point,

01:38.266 --> 01:41.508
but I did find rat
droppings this morning.

01:41.602 --> 01:43.263
Okay, maybe I will
take away these dishes.

01:43.354 --> 01:46.517
But not because you told
me to, scary dish Nazi.

01:46.607 --> 01:48.939
Hey, I'm picky. Not psychotic.

01:49.026 --> 01:51.733
Family is always psychotic.

01:54.198 --> 01:57.406
Five minutes until our show starts.

01:57.493 --> 02:00.030
Oh, Martha, Martha.

02:00.121 --> 02:03.363
You'd think after sixty years

02:03.457 --> 02:07.791
that you would have learned
how to lock the front door.

02:11.674 --> 02:14.711
Haven't you been reading the papers?

02:14.802 --> 02:16.963
It will break Mother's
heart if she finds out

02:17.054 --> 02:21.047
what's really happening
in the neighbourhood.

02:21.142 --> 02:25.932
Thieves. Rapists.
Hiding in every corner.

02:26.022 --> 02:28.513
But they can't get us.

02:30.735 --> 02:35.650
When they come, we'll be ready.

02:37.491 --> 02:42.576
Oh, there you are. Are you
ready for the Spin, Win, Grin?

02:42.663 --> 02:46.622
After sixty years, I'm ready
for you to shut the hell up.

03:03.851 --> 03:06.809
Life is hard when you
don't know who you are.

03:06.896 --> 03:09.683
It's harder when you
don't know what you are.

03:09.774 --> 03:12.686
My love carries a death sentence.

03:12.777 --> 03:14.938
l was lost for years,

03:15.029 --> 03:17.645
searching, while hiding,

03:17.740 --> 03:21.858
only to find that I belong to
a world hidden from humans.

03:21.952 --> 03:26.867
I won't hide anymore.
I will live the life I choose.

03:32.922 --> 03:34.878
You're meeting Lauren for drinks later.

03:34.965 --> 03:35.795
Right.

03:35.883 --> 03:37.874
So, you don't have to come with me.

03:37.968 --> 03:39.629
Sure.

03:39.720 --> 03:42.632
It's just business. A little side venture.

03:42.723 --> 03:44.224
Okay.

03:44.308 --> 03:46.515
Have you seen my dreamcatcher?

03:50.731 --> 03:52.471
No, my big one.

03:52.566 --> 03:56.479
Oh, I am so coming for
this, whatever this is.

03:56.570 --> 04:00.062
Just be cool, okay?

04:00.157 --> 04:02.944
Well, one of us has to be.

04:06.664 --> 04:10.077
[KENZI] Namaste.
You must be Cheryl Fields.

04:10.167 --> 04:10.997
My friend Bonnie raved

04:11.085 --> 04:14.703
about the smudging that you
did at that former co-op.

04:14.797 --> 04:17.413
Thank you for doing this
on such short notice.

04:17.508 --> 04:21.877
My time is fluid. All time is, really.

04:21.971 --> 04:25.884
The heirs insist on a complete cleansing
before I officially put it on the market.

04:25.975 --> 04:28.887
Well, the place sure needs it.
What happened here, anyway?

04:28.978 --> 04:30.684
Messy incident about a week ago.

04:30.771 --> 04:32.432
Do not mind my assistant.

04:32.523 --> 04:36.857
She is very intuitive, but has
the tact of a grizzly bear.

04:36.944 --> 04:39.856
Of course, Shaman Czigany.

04:39.947 --> 04:40.902
"Shaman"?

04:40.990 --> 04:44.403
Please do shut up and
light the sage stick.

04:47.830 --> 04:52.950
Do not worry. We will cleanse this
place of all residual evil forces.

04:53.043 --> 04:57.332
--God bless you.
--Goddess, bless us all.

05:05.347 --> 05:10.307
[speaking Russian]

05:21.238 --> 05:22.694
Thank you.

05:24.033 --> 05:25.773
Sweet couple of spinsters.

05:25.868 --> 05:29.406
Lifetime together in the family
home, unfortunate tragedy.

05:29.497 --> 05:30.828
This is typical neighbour speak for,

05:30.915 --> 05:33.748
"The blood bath next door
tanked our property values."

05:33.834 --> 05:34.914
I thought I was the cynic.

05:35.002 --> 05:36.833
What do you want me to say?
Granny snapped,

05:36.921 --> 05:39.833
stitch 'n' bitched her own sister.
It's an open-and-shut murder-suicide.

05:39.924 --> 05:42.006
It's the fourth one in
three months, Hale.

05:42.092 --> 05:44.469
So, what, murder-suicide
is contagious now?

05:44.553 --> 05:46.293
If the Dark Fae is involved, yeah.

05:46.388 --> 05:50.677
What Dark Fae? I've never heard
of anything that could do this.

05:50.768 --> 05:54.260
That's why I want to keep canvassing
the neighbourhood, you know?

05:54.355 --> 05:58.018
See if anybody saw anything unusual.

05:58.108 --> 06:01.441
Like a bright yellow
succ-mobile, maybe?

06:01.529 --> 06:04.271
Look at that, parked right in
front of Casa de Massacre.

06:04.365 --> 06:06.447
It's like this girl is addicted to trouble.

06:06.534 --> 06:09.617
[speaking Russian]

06:09.703 --> 06:13.946
Oh, to the west, our best.
To the east, be released.

06:14.041 --> 06:19.081
To the south, to the north,
all spirits go forth!

06:28.222 --> 06:29.883
Are you okay?

06:29.974 --> 06:36.311
[KENZI] Oh, I am so sorry. Oh,
it just takes so much out of me.

06:36.397 --> 06:39.013
--Thank you, Sequoia.
--[BO] No, no. Thank you.

06:39.108 --> 06:44.353
The dwelling has been cleansed.
There will be no more darkness here.

06:44.446 --> 06:47.483
So, I can list it with a
guilt-free conscience.

06:47.575 --> 06:51.318
Good thing. The neighbourhood
prices are skyrocketing.

06:51.412 --> 06:54.904
--So are my commissions.
--Yes, of course. Cash?

06:54.999 --> 06:56.864
Yes, please.

06:58.085 --> 06:59.586
Thank you.

07:03.966 --> 07:05.831
[BO] Thanks.

07:05.926 --> 07:10.215
Uh oh. Don't look now. | smell bacon.

07:10.306 --> 07:11.216
[whistles]

07:11.307 --> 07:13.514
You know, you don't have to
keep following me around?

07:13.601 --> 07:15.216
There's these things called cell phones.

07:15.311 --> 07:16.767
Hey, this is my crime scene.

07:16.854 --> 07:19.095
--Once they go wolf...
--Oh, please.

07:19.189 --> 07:22.556
Hi, Nana. Nice babushka.
You running some new gypsy con?

07:22.651 --> 07:24.687
I'm an innocent entrepreneur...

07:24.778 --> 07:25.858
Ha!

07:25.946 --> 07:27.607
Who will cut you in at five percent.

07:27.698 --> 07:29.529
--As you were.
--Yeah.

07:29.617 --> 07:31.073
--So, what happened here?
--If I tell you,

07:31.160 --> 07:32.195
will you agree to help me?

07:32.286 --> 07:35.870
You asking me for help?

07:35.956 --> 07:38.197
Relax. It's not a marriage proposal.

07:38.292 --> 07:40.624
I already sent out the invites.

07:41.795 --> 07:44.081
--Meet me at the Dal?
--Maybe.

07:48.802 --> 07:51.544
Sixty-eight years old
and she kills her sister?

07:51.639 --> 07:53.220
Sounds like a Dark Fae to me.

07:53.307 --> 07:56.549
Yeah, maybe. Hale thinks I'm nuts.

07:56.644 --> 07:59.135
Truth is humans sometimes just
kill each other, you know.

07:59.229 --> 08:01.060
Take away their flat-screens
and their minivans

08:01.148 --> 08:03.764
and they're just still barbarians.

08:03.859 --> 08:06.566
So, why are you investigating?

08:06.654 --> 08:08.770
There's been a series
of murder-suicides,

08:08.864 --> 08:11.901
all within confined households.

08:11.992 --> 08:14.483
All within this five mile radius.

08:14.578 --> 08:17.069
Freaky. So, what can I do?

08:17.164 --> 08:18.779
Keep your ear to the ground.

08:18.874 --> 08:22.162
Maybe ask some of your
Dark Fae contacts?

08:22.252 --> 08:28.088
Ah, see? I told you that being
unaligned would have its privileges.

08:28.175 --> 08:29.631
Look, whatever this thing is,

08:29.718 --> 08:31.299
it's going to be big and
it's going to be powerful.

08:31.387 --> 08:35.596
Well, all that was in that house
is dust. Dust and cobwebs.

08:35.683 --> 08:37.264
Hey, stranger.

08:37.351 --> 08:38.966
Hey.

08:40.187 --> 08:41.768
Am I late or early?

08:41.855 --> 08:45.939
No, we... we had plans.

08:46.026 --> 08:47.436
Oh, yeah? Doctor-patient stuff?

08:47.528 --> 08:51.271
Just being social. Were you leaving?

08:51.365 --> 08:53.697
What, and miss this?

08:55.619 --> 08:58.486
Great.

08:58.580 --> 09:00.116
Why don't we...

09:00.207 --> 09:03.495
Why don't we just all hang out for
a bit, okay? Scooch over, Dyson.

09:03.585 --> 09:07.123
--I don't scooch.
--Oh, come on, you're part wolf.

09:07.214 --> 09:10.001
I'm sure we can find him
a carpet or something.

09:11.635 --> 09:13.626
Yeah.

09:13.721 --> 09:17.964
So, we've never done this before, huh?

09:18.058 --> 09:20.470
Just the three of us.

09:20.561 --> 09:22.176
--Like a threesome.
--Hmm.

09:22.271 --> 09:25.229
Not that I've thought about it
that way or anything, but...

09:27.151 --> 09:28.732
Wow.

09:29.570 --> 09:33.313
I love me some Bo, but she's
got to end the juggling act.

09:33.407 --> 09:35.147
ljust wish we had some popcorn.

09:35.242 --> 09:36.743
Being a good person means--

09:36.827 --> 09:40.820
She's not a person.
She's a mystical panty-remover.

09:40.914 --> 09:44.498
...means not being oblivious to
other peep's feelings. You feel me?

09:44.585 --> 09:46.166
Like her B.F.F.'s jealousy?

09:46.253 --> 09:48.835
Exactly. Wait, what?

09:48.922 --> 09:50.173
Look, you don't have
to fake it with me.

09:50.257 --> 09:52.839
I know what it's like hanging
with an Alpha dog, okay?

09:52.926 --> 09:58.762
Still, I do all right. Lots of loose,
leftover lovelies for the H-bomb.

09:58.849 --> 10:01.511
You're officially the most
disgusting man alive. Wow.

10:01.602 --> 10:04.765
What? Girl, get a sense
of humour, por favor.

10:04.855 --> 10:06.516
Ow.

10:06.607 --> 10:11.727
Ow. God, I think
something bit me. Ow.

10:13.155 --> 10:16.192
Well, yeah that will happen

10:16.283 --> 10:20.242
when you carry a damn
arsenal in your purse, girl.

10:21.663 --> 10:23.369
Nice.

10:23.457 --> 10:26.699
Hey, relax. It's just a scratch.

10:26.794 --> 10:31.379
It's not that. You're just
giving me a headache.

10:31.465 --> 10:32.705
I'm surprised to see you here, Dyson,

10:32.800 --> 10:34.961
since you can't seem to
return my phone calls.

10:35.052 --> 10:36.713
Well, I've always got time for a beer.

10:36.804 --> 10:38.385
Just don't much like
being poked and prodded.

10:38.472 --> 10:39.882
Come on now, it's just a physical.

10:39.973 --> 10:42.885
I haven't had a sick day
since before you were born.

10:42.976 --> 10:44.261
The Ash requires it.

10:44.353 --> 10:45.718
Well, then he can call me himself.

10:45.813 --> 10:48.054
We're on the same side, Dyson.

10:48.148 --> 10:50.480
No, you're a human
that works for my side.

10:50.567 --> 10:53.934
Now I really think that we
should just do all these shots.

10:54.029 --> 10:58.398
Okay? Here. Lauren? Dyson? Good.

10:58.492 --> 11:01.074
My work is the will of the Ash.
Are you questioning that?

11:01.161 --> 11:03.117
Are you questioning my fealty?

11:03.205 --> 11:04.786
You know what? I'm not even
really sure what that is,

11:04.873 --> 11:06.909
but I'm pretty sure she
was not questioning it.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.740
I can speak for myself.

11:08.836 --> 11:11.122
When the Ash lets you.

11:14.174 --> 11:18.258
Thanks for the... fun.

11:18.345 --> 11:20.006
Yeah.

11:24.017 --> 11:26.724
Do you always have to be you?

11:30.899 --> 11:33.436
Pip, pip, my khaki-loving kids.

11:33.527 --> 11:38.692
Did you know that safari
means "long journey" in Swahili?

11:38.782 --> 11:39.862
I did not.

11:39.950 --> 11:43.818
Who knows who we
will see on our safari?

11:43.912 --> 11:47.621
Maybe an elephant.

11:47.708 --> 11:51.200
"Dear K. Your turn to fold. Love, Bo."

11:53.463 --> 11:55.044
[screaming]

11:58.051 --> 12:01.293
[BO] Well, let me know if you
do hear anything, Siegfried.

12:01.388 --> 12:04.846
Yeah, no, I know. Sometimes
humans just kill each other.

12:05.767 --> 12:06.802
[KENZI] What was that about?

12:06.894 --> 12:09.681
Helping Dyson with a case.

12:09.771 --> 12:11.807
More Jungle Jeeves? Really?

12:11.899 --> 12:13.730
It's my happy place.

12:13.817 --> 12:17.810
Nobody can stop him. Not
lions, tigers, or bears. Oh my!

12:17.905 --> 12:19.736
I'd do him.

12:21.742 --> 12:23.357
Whoopsie.

12:24.912 --> 12:26.903
So, did you pick a lover?

12:26.997 --> 12:29.363
Or did Dr. Freeze and
Canine Crotch fight to death?

12:29.458 --> 12:30.493
You know, I don't get it.

12:30.584 --> 12:33.326
Dyson is the one that gave me the
green light to see other people

12:33.420 --> 12:35.661
and then Lauren shows
up and he gets all testy.

12:35.756 --> 12:37.838
Because he has testes.

12:37.925 --> 12:42.385
Dudes tend to get irrationally
territorial. It's a ball thing.

12:42.471 --> 12:43.677
Oh, I knew it meant nothing.

12:43.764 --> 12:46.346
l have to stop waiting for that guy
to become emotionally available.

12:46.433 --> 12:51.223
Don't give up yet. His eyes say "No,"
but his inner wolf says, "Oooh yes."

12:51.313 --> 12:53.395
--And Lauren?
--She's human. I could kill her.

12:53.482 --> 12:55.848
Thought she fixed your
hungry honey pot?

12:55.943 --> 12:59.060
Yeah, helluva test run--with
someone that I care about.

12:59.154 --> 13:04.319
Poor Bo. So many choices,
just one vag.

13:06.119 --> 13:08.735
It is just good to be home.

13:10.791 --> 13:12.577
Now fold.

13:58.338 --> 14:04.004
"A natural source of minerals
and vitamins." So, no Vicodin.

14:07.097 --> 14:12.057
[whispering]

14:14.855 --> 14:16.971
Bo?

14:21.111 --> 14:23.352
Are you going to clean this mess up?

14:29.286 --> 14:32.119
I must have had more to drink
last night than I thought.

14:32.205 --> 14:34.116
My head is throbbing.

14:34.207 --> 14:35.913
Mine, too.

14:37.544 --> 14:39.660
Did you hear that?

14:41.465 --> 14:43.956
What?

14:44.051 --> 14:49.011
I don't know. It sounds like
whispering kids or giggling elves.

14:49.097 --> 14:53.056
Did you bring home elves last night?
I'm not judging. | just want to know.

14:53.143 --> 14:56.806
All I hear is somebody who will
not chew with her mouth shut.

14:56.897 --> 15:02.642
Oh, I'm sorry, Kenz. I'm sorry.
ljust feel so blargh.

15:02.736 --> 15:04.351
Might be worth a visit to Lauren?

15:04.446 --> 15:09.315
Yeah, right. After last night?
It would not be wise.

15:09.409 --> 15:14.199
Neither are Toastie Bun Buns,
but look at me.

15:14.289 --> 15:16.371
Aahh.

15:16.458 --> 15:19.871
Well, physically, you're fine.

15:19.961 --> 15:23.374
But emotionally, I'm a level ten harpie.

15:29.471 --> 15:31.507
--Is she--
--Of the Boston Harpies.

15:31.598 --> 15:32.383
Great.

15:32.432 --> 15:34.218
The headaches, the tiredness,
the short temper,

15:34.309 --> 15:36.015
you can chalk that up to the injections.

15:36.103 --> 15:37.559
Well, did you change up the formula?

15:37.646 --> 15:39.227
Well, I'm always tinkering with it.

15:39.314 --> 15:41.396
I'm trying to provide the
most effective treatment.

15:41.483 --> 15:45.852
It's more of an art than a science.
And you have a unique set of hormones.

15:45.946 --> 15:49.939
Well, when my hormones flare up,
I usually go horny, not horrid.

15:50.033 --> 15:54.697
Although, last night, I guess
I was kind of insensitive.

15:54.788 --> 15:57.746
So, Dyson? What is that?

15:57.833 --> 15:59.369
Doc? Can I talk to you for a second?

15:59.459 --> 16:01.370
Sure.

16:01.461 --> 16:04.919
My head is pounding harder
than a sailor on shore leave.

16:06.716 --> 16:09.924
Your photosensitivity looks heightened.

16:10.011 --> 16:12.468
You could be fighting off a flu.

16:30.407 --> 16:31.317
Wow.

16:31.408 --> 16:34.400
Med school. Worth every dime.

16:34.494 --> 16:36.325
Well, the only other thing I can
think of is that there's something

16:36.413 --> 16:39.246
in your environment that's
making both of you sick.

16:39.332 --> 16:40.947
Mould, asbestos?

16:41.042 --> 16:43.954
Maybe a butt-load of food-encrusted
dishes lying around the house?

16:44.045 --> 16:47.913
--You ready to rumble?
--No, you go ahead.

16:48.008 --> 16:50.090
I've got to go help Dyson with a case.

16:50.177 --> 16:52.133
Okay.

16:55.348 --> 16:58.932
Scott Abbot was Danielle Swift's cousin.
He's the one who found the body.

16:59.019 --> 17:01.260
Fran De Rossa was the Swifts' nanny.

17:01.354 --> 17:03.845
Great. What about our
old biddie butcher?

17:03.940 --> 17:08.149
Martha Cage went to
church with Joy De Rossa.

17:08.236 --> 17:09.271
Nice.

17:09.362 --> 17:10.522
They are all connected.

17:10.614 --> 17:15.028
The vics and the perps, they all knew
each other, however, tenuously.

17:15.118 --> 17:18.451
I had to pull some strings,
but got the evidence boxes

17:18.538 --> 17:21.496
from the other jurisdictions
for the first two killings.

17:21.583 --> 17:23.665
This case is making me nuts.

17:23.752 --> 17:28.337
Speaking of your nuts--
succubus, ten o'clock.

17:28.423 --> 17:31.961
Can I talk to you for
a second, privately?

17:32.052 --> 17:33.917
Sure.

17:35.889 --> 17:37.129
This is private-ish.

17:37.224 --> 17:40.842
l grilled my Dark Fae
contacts--Siegfried, Bobby D,

17:40.936 --> 17:42.972
that merman with the eczema.

17:43.063 --> 17:46.897
No one seems to know anything
about your murder-suicides,

17:46.983 --> 17:50.225
but still, I put together
a list of possible leads.

17:50.320 --> 17:51.150
Thank you.

17:51.238 --> 17:53.650
Now I need for you to
do something for me.

17:53.740 --> 17:55.731
Can you run a background
check on Kenzi?

17:55.825 --> 17:56.814
What? Why?

17:56.910 --> 17:59.822
She's acting strange and mean.

17:59.913 --> 18:02.325
| feel like she's going to
do something against me.

18:02.415 --> 18:05.327
Why not just kill her?

18:05.418 --> 18:06.328
What?

18:06.419 --> 18:09.206
I said since when don't you trust Kenzi?

18:09.297 --> 18:11.379
Oh.

18:11.466 --> 18:14.173
Oh, yeah, no. You're probably right.
I mean, she's already a thief.

18:14.261 --> 18:15.922
What's a background check
going to tell me, right?

18:16.012 --> 18:18.219
--Are you okay, Bo?
--|'m fine. I'm just twitchy

18:18.306 --> 18:20.843
and I'm itchy, and...

18:20.934 --> 18:24.392
But I hope you find whatever this is.

18:24.479 --> 18:26.060
Bye.

18:26.147 --> 18:29.275
If you're done dancing over
there, you should come witness.

18:32.279 --> 18:35.271
Unless this is Peter Parker's shirt,
we got a problem, man.

18:35.365 --> 18:39.699
Bo said the Cage house
was full of cobwebs, too.

18:39.786 --> 18:43.699
The Abbots' house--there
was a ton over there, too.

18:43.790 --> 18:46.031
What? I just thought
they had nasty hygiene.

18:46.126 --> 18:48.788
I've got to take this to
the Fae labs. Pack it up.

18:52.841 --> 18:55.207
[LAUREN] An arachnid
could never spin this.

18:55.302 --> 18:58.385
The webbing is astonishingly intricate.

18:58.471 --> 19:01.258
And eight hundred
percent stronger than silk.

19:01.349 --> 19:02.589
So, it is Fae?

19:02.684 --> 19:05.050
My money's on something
old and unpleasant.

19:05.145 --> 19:08.228
I'll need time to do the cell analysis.

19:08.315 --> 19:13.059
In the meantime, you've
dodged my calls long enough.

19:13.153 --> 19:15.314
Time for a little quid pro quo.

19:15.405 --> 19:17.771
You've got to be kidding me.

19:17.866 --> 19:19.276
Sit.

19:20.660 --> 19:23.322
Reflexes, excellent.

19:24.706 --> 19:28.915
And your police bosses have
you in therapy? Because...?

19:29.002 --> 19:30.117
That's personal.

19:30.211 --> 19:31.587
Nothing's personal with the Ash.

19:31.671 --> 19:35.755
Ah, so you're his doctor and
his narc. That's good to know.

19:35.842 --> 19:39.426
Well, I'm an excellent multitasker.

19:39.512 --> 19:41.503
Unbutton your shirt, please.

19:43.183 --> 19:46.641
Bo also mentioned that
you've been extremely tired.

19:47.729 --> 19:48.935
Bo said that, huh?

19:49.022 --> 19:51.764
I guess she was worried about you.

19:51.858 --> 19:53.644
And we're close.

19:53.735 --> 19:56.852
She knows she can talk to me.

19:56.946 --> 20:00.530
Yeah, I'm tired, but it's Bo's fault.

20:00.617 --> 20:01.652
Why's that?

20:01.743 --> 20:05.656
Well, if you guys are that
close, then just ask her.

20:07.207 --> 20:09.949
--Sure, Dyson.
--Do l have to wait for my analysis?

20:10.043 --> 20:11.533
No, we're done here.

20:11.628 --> 20:13.869
That's great. Good talk, Doc.

20:20.136 --> 20:22.969
Kenzi, do we have any calamine lotion?

20:23.056 --> 20:25.388
I think I'm allergic
to cop shop coffee.

20:25.475 --> 20:29.468
Get over here. God,
you're so aggravating.

20:29.562 --> 20:30.722
What has gotten into you?

20:30.814 --> 20:33.305
I think we need to call
an exterminator, or ten.

20:33.400 --> 20:37.734
'Cause I almost just got webbed in
the face by the mother of all spiders.

20:37.821 --> 20:40.528
An insect. Really?

20:41.408 --> 20:46.698
lt tried to web me in the face.
In my face part of my face.

20:46.788 --> 20:48.995
You don't believe me? Fine.

20:49.082 --> 20:52.916
It's being scared of us in the basement.
That's where it scurried.

20:59.426 --> 21:00.836
Why don't you go first?

21:00.927 --> 21:04.044
Wouldn't want you to push me
down the stairs or anything.

21:07.142 --> 21:12.432
lt'sjust a bug. lt'sjust a bug.
It's just a big bad-ass bug.

21:16.151 --> 21:18.517
[phone ringing]

21:18.611 --> 21:20.442
--Dyson.
--That sample you gave me

21:20.530 --> 21:21.736
is from a Djieien.

21:21.823 --> 21:22.778
[DYSON] Never heard of it.

21:22.866 --> 21:24.197
[LAUREN] Well, they're extremely rare.

21:24.284 --> 21:26.024
There's not much
information in the database.

21:26.119 --> 21:27.108
Well, what do we know?

21:27.203 --> 21:29.694
It's a nomadic Native
American Underfae.

21:29.789 --> 21:32.531
lnjects its victims with a venom
that stimulates the hypothalamus,

21:32.625 --> 21:35.537
causing hallucinations and paranoia.

21:35.628 --> 21:36.788
That's always a great combo.

21:36.880 --> 21:38.290
[LAUREN] Well, it gets worse.

21:38.381 --> 21:40.588
The venom circulates
through the nervous system,

21:40.675 --> 21:43.542
producing increasingly
powerful bursts of aggression,

21:43.636 --> 21:47.128
persecution anxieties,
and finally, homicidal rage.

21:47.223 --> 21:50.135
Without a target for that rage, the
victims often end up attacking--

21:50.226 --> 21:52.137
Each other.

21:52.228 --> 21:56.767
The Djieien then psychically feeds off
the flood of adrenalized pheromones.

21:56.858 --> 21:59.645
But in some of these households, more
than one person was holding a weapon.

21:59.736 --> 22:01.101
Why didn't they just leave the house?

22:01.196 --> 22:04.063
It won't let them. The creature
may bite multiple victims,

22:04.157 --> 22:07.615
causing intense fear,
maybe agoraphobia.

22:07.702 --> 22:09.613
Whatever it takes to
keep them contained.

22:09.704 --> 22:10.819
What are the initial symptoms?

22:10.914 --> 22:14.577
Headaches, dizziness,
itchiness, paranoia.

22:14.667 --> 22:15.952
Goddamn it, it's got Bo.

22:16.044 --> 22:18.456
--Are you sure?
--Unfortunately, yes.

22:18.546 --> 22:20.832
Dyson, as long as this thing is living,
it'll have a hold on her.

22:20.924 --> 22:23.131
Okay, well, what does
this thing look like?

22:23.218 --> 22:26.756
A spider. A giant, hairy spider.

22:26.846 --> 22:28.382
Got it.

22:29.432 --> 22:31.798
Dr. Lewis, you pushed the alarm.

22:31.893 --> 22:33.758
We have a situation.

22:33.853 --> 22:35.093
[KENZI] I've seen this movie.

22:35.188 --> 22:37.179
The funny friend ends up
with a frickin' hockey skate

22:37.273 --> 22:39.650
in the jugular every time.

22:39.734 --> 22:43.147
Well, let's hope the
spider isn't wearing skates.

22:45.198 --> 22:47.029
Oh!

22:47.116 --> 22:50.358
You've been marked.
Chosen by the spider. l'm safe.

22:50.453 --> 22:53.445
I thought you said
he went for your face.

22:53.540 --> 22:56.031
Shut up! God.

23:01.256 --> 23:05.124
[BO] That is a lot of web
for a wee little spider.

23:05.218 --> 23:08.130
Wee? You could put a
saddle on that thing.

23:08.221 --> 23:10.507
I thought you said it
was the size of a rat.

23:11.808 --> 23:15.972
--What was that?
--Quick, Plan B.

23:16.062 --> 23:17.643
Go get him, tiger.

23:17.730 --> 23:19.937
I hate Plan B.

23:28.241 --> 23:30.482
We're trapped.

23:30.577 --> 23:33.569
At least we're together.

23:33.663 --> 23:37.372
Right. Together, we'll be fine.

23:37.458 --> 23:39.870
As long as we keep our heads.

23:46.092 --> 23:47.047
Kenzi!

23:47.135 --> 23:48.841
[Russian]

23:48.928 --> 23:51.260
Do not go all Russian on
me, okay. Don't panic!

23:51.347 --> 23:52.211
Why?

23:52.307 --> 23:54.013
I don't know. It's just
something people say.

23:54.100 --> 23:56.182
People that lose a wedding
ring or gain some weight.

23:56.269 --> 23:58.510
Not somebody trapped
by a freakin' spider.

23:58.605 --> 24:02.518
I wonder why the spider chose our place,
what with all the free frickin' eats!

24:02.609 --> 24:04.725
Yeah, well, now that he's here,
maybe you can make out with him.

24:04.819 --> 24:06.525
And then maybe you can
make out with his best friend.

24:06.613 --> 24:09.104
Maybe he can die of a broken heart!

24:09.198 --> 24:12.190
Mr. Hippopotamus says,
"Time to get rid of the succubus."

24:12.285 --> 24:14.617
We just need to stay calm, okay. Calm.

24:14.704 --> 24:15.784
She's too strong.

24:15.872 --> 24:17.737
Concentrate on beating this thing.

24:17.832 --> 24:21.620
...before she disposes of you. You
know she will. Just look at her eyes.

24:21.711 --> 24:26.045
Kenzi! We are trapped in this tomb of
a house by a giant freakin' spider.

24:26.132 --> 24:31.047
--Do you think you could tape this?
--[HALE] Hello, ladies?

24:31.137 --> 24:34.800
Silly monkey. Yes, you are.

24:34.891 --> 24:37.553
Dyson, I'm here.

24:37.644 --> 24:41.808
Whoa, it's like sad-ass
Halloween in here.

24:46.569 --> 24:51.233
Dyson, relax. Coaxing messed-up
girls out of their comfort zone?

24:51.324 --> 24:54.316
That's my calling, man.

24:54.410 --> 24:56.116
Phone. Now.

24:56.204 --> 25:00.618
This is not the pillow
fight I was expecting.

25:00.708 --> 25:03.165
Okay, all right. Just relax, okay?

25:03.252 --> 25:06.119
Look, take deep lady breaths.
That's a cute sword.

25:06.214 --> 25:09.752
Have you seen any raunchy
spiders around here?

25:09.842 --> 25:10.752
Why did you do that?

25:10.843 --> 25:13.255
He knew about the spider. He's in on it.

25:13.346 --> 25:15.337
Totally. Good thinking.

25:15.431 --> 25:17.171
Still dirty.

25:25.858 --> 25:29.316
Is that my vest? Did you steal my vest?

25:29.404 --> 25:31.770
It's not stealing if I
haven't left the house yet.

25:31.864 --> 25:33.695
Oh, god, I'm so angry at you!

25:33.783 --> 25:36.946
If we were in prison,
I'd give you such a shiv.

25:37.036 --> 25:38.776
Why am I so mad at you?

25:38.871 --> 25:40.657
I mean, sure, you're a total slob,

25:40.748 --> 25:44.161
immature, have horrible taste in men,
and you always need saving.

25:44.252 --> 25:45.332
God, you're awful.

25:45.420 --> 25:46.626
At least I don't have man feet.

25:46.713 --> 25:48.294
This isn't right. Something's
not right with my head.

25:48.381 --> 25:50.121
And can we please
talk about your hair?

25:50.216 --> 25:56.007
I'm serious. The headaches,
the itching, the voices.

25:56.097 --> 25:59.840
Kenzi, I'm sick. I need to feed.

26:03.730 --> 26:05.641
Can I offer you a pastry?

26:05.732 --> 26:07.347
I'm not that kind of hungry, sweetie.

26:07.442 --> 26:09.854
Oh, no, no, no, no.

26:11.487 --> 26:13.478
| always knew this day would come,

26:13.573 --> 26:16.064
when you'd get hungry enough
that you'd just eat my face.

26:16.159 --> 26:20.528
Put the bat down.
This won't hurt... much.

26:20.621 --> 26:21.906
Bo!

26:21.998 --> 26:24.205
Fine. Be like that.

26:35.303 --> 26:36.884
You'll do.

26:49.358 --> 26:51.974
I'm so hungry.

27:16.385 --> 27:17.886
Kenzi!

27:17.970 --> 27:19.961
Kenzi, it's okay. There's
something wrong with us.

27:20.056 --> 27:22.763
I think that we were hallucinating.

27:25.478 --> 27:27.139
I'm getting help.

27:28.481 --> 27:29.971
--Ma'am, get back in the zone.
--Who the hell are you?

27:30.066 --> 27:33.558
Back in the house. Now! It's real simple.

27:33.653 --> 27:35.769
You leave, we kill you.

27:35.863 --> 27:39.026
--That's insane.
--That's quarantine.

27:53.339 --> 27:54.749
Detective Dyson.

27:54.841 --> 27:57.332
Is this part of your,
what do humans say, beat?

27:57.426 --> 27:59.462
I haven't seen you since
that night in Manila.

27:59.554 --> 28:02.762
Serena. What are you doing here?

28:02.849 --> 28:04.635
Walk with me.

28:04.725 --> 28:07.592
You're looking at the Ash's
new Head of Security.

28:07.687 --> 28:10.599
Congratulations. Now can you tell
me what the hell this is all about?

28:10.690 --> 28:14.274
This position has its
perks and its downsides.

28:14.360 --> 28:16.942
Like informing a colleague that
his friends have been isolated.

28:17.029 --> 28:18.360
This is officially a lockdown.

28:18.447 --> 28:21.655
Quarantine? Who made that call?

28:21.742 --> 28:23.607
--Lauren.
--Try to understand.

28:23.703 --> 28:28.788
This Djieien feeds on human and
Fae alike. It must be exterminated,

28:28.875 --> 28:30.786
along with the infected.

28:30.877 --> 28:31.787
I've got to get in there.

28:31.878 --> 28:34.870
Do you really think that's the best way
to help your friends? Your partner?

28:34.964 --> 28:37.831
Serena, you got to give
me something here.

28:37.925 --> 28:41.292
For old times' sake?

28:41.387 --> 28:42.627
I can give you two hours.

28:42.722 --> 28:44.678
And what the hell am I
supposed to do from out here?

28:44.765 --> 28:46.505
Two hours.

28:50.646 --> 28:51.897
Should I pull back the team?

28:51.981 --> 28:54.973
No. We're still on schedule.

28:55.067 --> 28:57.353
There's nothing he can do.
They're as good as dead.

28:57.445 --> 29:00.903
Hell, they may have
already killed each other.

29:00.990 --> 29:03.151
Pick up. Pick up.

29:03.242 --> 29:04.072

29:04.160 --> 29:05.821
--Are you okay?
--Not exactly.

29:05.912 --> 29:08.153
A spider bit me and I went kind
of 'Nam, but I healed myself.

29:08.247 --> 29:10.488
Healed how? You didn't
use Kenzi, did you?

29:10.583 --> 29:12.073
No. l fed off Hale.

29:12.168 --> 29:14.659
Fed how exactly from Hale?

29:14.754 --> 29:18.463
Can we just focus? I did what I
had to do. Hale is absolutely fine.

29:25.097 --> 29:27.088
Oh, shit.

29:27.183 --> 29:30.516
No! Yes, keep moving. Keep walking.

29:30.603 --> 29:33.015
Fffft. Fffft.

Shoo! Get off my shoe.

29:38.945 --> 29:43.314
Oh, not my leg. Oh, shit!

29:49.872 --> 29:51.737
They won't let us leave.

29:51.832 --> 29:53.242
l'm outside. I'm working on it.

29:53.334 --> 29:55.370
What?

29:55.461 --> 29:58.248
Well, see, that is why you
are my favourite stalker.

29:58.339 --> 30:00.125
Just hang on. Keep them safe.

30:00.216 --> 30:02.377
I will. Yeah.

30:02.468 --> 30:04.049
You got to kill this thing.

30:04.136 --> 30:06.297
Oh, with pleasure.

30:11.644 --> 30:13.475
Bar's closed!

30:13.562 --> 30:15.894
What the hell are you doing
calling in the Ash's hit squad?

30:15.982 --> 30:19.224
1872. A Djieien infects
a mining community,

30:19.318 --> 30:21.559
leading to the mass murder
of six hundred souls.

30:21.654 --> 30:23.565
Another single Djieien is
thought to be responsible

30:23.656 --> 30:25.647
for the bulk of the Sudanese genocide.

30:25.741 --> 30:27.242
You didn't even give Bo a chance.

30:27.326 --> 30:28.941
Dyson, she did the right thing.

30:29.036 --> 30:30.116
Bullshit!

30:30.204 --> 30:34.072
Look, ljust bought us two more
hours until they burn the place down.

30:34.166 --> 30:38.079
So, you tell me--how do
we beat this thing?

30:38.170 --> 30:39.876
[TRICK] We don't know.

30:55.438 --> 30:57.804
This is my house.

31:04.613 --> 31:06.990
These are my friends.

31:18.419 --> 31:23.083
So, if you wanted to piss me off,
mission accomplished.

31:29.096 --> 31:31.132
Nice trick.

31:31.223 --> 31:33.009
What the hell are you?

31:33.100 --> 31:37.059
Doesn't matter. I can
keep this up all night.

31:43.277 --> 31:44.858
Kenzi?

31:46.238 --> 31:49.776
Sweetie? Was that you?

31:53.746 --> 31:55.907
--More bad news.
--Wonderful.

31:55.998 --> 32:01.163
Listen to this. "The creature is
so crafty, it buries its heart."

32:01.253 --> 32:02.538
So, you find the heart and destroy it.

32:02.630 --> 32:05.417
The spider itself is virtually invincible.

32:05.508 --> 32:07.214
Lovely.

32:07.301 --> 32:10.839
Look, before Bo got infected,
she did some digging around for me.

32:10.930 --> 32:15.219
She put a list of leads together from
her Dark Fae contacts on my case.

32:16.685 --> 32:18.516

--Wait! Gordon Hurley?

32:20.356 --> 32:21.106
Yeah. You know him?

32:21.148 --> 32:23.525
He deals with exotic
animals and Underfae.

32:23.609 --> 32:28.273
lmports a lot of nasty stuff from the
black market for sport, food, whatever.

32:28.364 --> 32:30.195
He hasn't been in the bar
for about three months.

32:30.282 --> 32:32.739
That's about when the
murder-suicides started.

32:33.953 --> 32:35.409
Is he in the book?

32:37.456 --> 32:39.287
[TRICK] He's in my book.

32:43.129 --> 32:46.963
I'm going with you.
I can identify the heart.

and better. Try to keep up.

--Freaky bitch bit me.

33:01.564 --> 33:03.646

--Don't worry. I locked Bo in the basement.

--You just hang tight.
--The front door is bricked off.

You take me with you.
I'll let you live, okay?

33:34.930 --> 33:38.843
You'd pick me over Bo, right,

Of course, Kenz. Of course.

34:15.221 --> 34:19.840
Just a bit further. Go on, now.

34:19.934 --> 34:22.471
The secret way out is
through Bo's bedroom?

can whistle loud enough

She just gets moody.

35:17.157 --> 35:18.693
Yeah, moody like Jeffrey Dahmer.

35:18.784 --> 35:20.524
I better get going home
for when she finishes.

Trick! Please don't let
them hurt my baby.

35:26.292 --> 35:27.202
Is he talking about a spider?

35:27.293 --> 35:29.409
He thinks the Djieien is his pet.

35:29.503 --> 35:32.119
She always comes back to me, okay?
Just once she's got her fill of death.

35:32.214 --> 35:33.374
Do you have anything
to shut this guy up?

35:33.465 --> 35:34.250
Yeah, I got something.

35:34.300 --> 35:35.540
Wait. We actually
need him still talking,

35:35.634 --> 35:37.545
so he can tell us where the
Djieien buried its heart.

35:37.636 --> 35:40.013
Don't worry. This will
only calm him some.

35:41.223 --> 35:44.135
Can you do that? Can you
tell us all about the Djieien?

35:44.226 --> 35:45.591
I'd do anything for her.

35:45.686 --> 35:47.642
--Great. He's spider-whipped.
--[TR|CK] It might be worse than that.

35:47.730 --> 35:49.095
It seems my translation was off.

35:49.189 --> 35:51.931
The Djieien doesn't bury
its heart. It implants it.

35:52.026 --> 35:54.062
lmplants it? Like, in something?

35:54.153 --> 35:56.940
Or someone.

wasn't going to hurt.

You should ask before
you borrow my things.

Call it what you want. I just
didn't think you had it in you.

40:48.280 --> 40:51.022
You don't think much
of me, do you, Dyson?

40:51.116 --> 40:54.108
You're inconsistent.
First, you call a strike on Bo,

40:54.202 --> 40:57.035
and then you stab a man to save her.

40:57.122 --> 40:58.862
| just don't trust your motives.

40:58.957 --> 41:02.370
Well, it's not your
trust I'm interested in.

41:02.461 --> 41:03.371
Fair enough.

41:03.462 --> 41:06.044
Is it really my loyalties you're
worried about, or that this time,

41:06.131 --> 41:07.541
l was Bo's hero?

41:07.633 --> 41:10.090
You're the one that
almost got her killed.

41:20.687 --> 41:23.224
For the bedroom door--
I got a nice, sturdy oak.

41:23.315 --> 41:24.896
Sturdy. That's good.

41:24.983 --> 41:26.268
Kenzi, you don't have to do that.

41:26.360 --> 41:28.066
Yeah, I do.

41:28.153 --> 41:30.565
I would like to think I wouldn't
have gone through with it.

41:30.656 --> 41:34.399
But I was ready to pull
the trigger. I wanted to.

41:34.493 --> 41:36.324
Hey, if I hadn't healed myself,

41:36.411 --> 41:38.322
I would have dissected you like a frog.

41:38.413 --> 41:39.823
For the record,

41:39.915 --> 41:43.908
whatever you do in your
entirely personal romantic life,

41:44.002 --> 41:45.458
I got you.

41:46.672 --> 41:48.754
Even when l was feeling
stabby, I knew that.

41:48.840 --> 41:49.955
Good. Truce.

41:50.050 --> 41:53.258
Pip, pip, my Serengeti Sallies.

41:53.345 --> 41:57.964
Want to know what happens
when a python meets a rhino?

41:58.058 --> 42:00.049
I hate this show.

42:03.689 --> 42:07.273
I give you pepperoni and extra cheese.

42:07.359 --> 42:10.476
You are a god in wolf's clothing.

42:10.570 --> 42:12.606
He's good. He's really good.

42:12.698 --> 42:14.438
--Hey.
--Hey.

42:14.533 --> 42:16.114
Sit a spell. Have a slice.

42:16.201 --> 42:18.442
A spell? Well, I would love to, m'lady.

42:18.537 --> 42:21.028
But I have a debriefing with the Ash.

42:21.123 --> 42:23.535
How very "Lauren" of you.

42:23.625 --> 42:28.039
Look, about Lauren, she's
just too close to the Ash.

42:28.130 --> 42:30.621
And you're too close
to her. It worries me.

42:30.716 --> 42:33.128
You know, I don't understand you.

42:33.218 --> 42:34.549
You say that you don't
want to be exclusive,

42:34.636 --> 42:36.297
that you want to see other people.

42:36.388 --> 42:38.629
--This isn't about seeing other people.
--We|l, then what's it about?

42:38.724 --> 42:41.010
I don't trust her.

42:41.101 --> 42:45.470
Well, I do. And if there's one
thing I can say about Lauren,

42:45.564 --> 42:48.476
it's that she cares.

42:48.567 --> 42:52.151
Are you willing to say the same thing?

42:52.237 --> 42:55.980
Fine. You've made your decision.

42:56.074 --> 42:58.736
Next time you need to heal,
you call Lauren.

43:01.955 --> 43:03.820
Nice talk.

43:03.915 --> 43:06.247
Are we pissed at Dyson again?

43:06.334 --> 43:08.996
Is he trying to buy us off with pizza?

43:09.087 --> 43:10.827
--Kenzi?
--Hmm?

43:10.922 --> 43:13.664
Don't ever change.

43:13.759 --> 43:16.922
Honey, I couldn't if I tried.

43:22.476 --> 43:23.591
What's that?

43:23.685 --> 43:27.223
Bug spray. Just in case.
