WEBVTT

00:01.392 --> 00:03.046
Previously on
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend...

00:03.090 --> 00:04.917
You're more stable
and self-aware than you were.

00:04.961 --> 00:10.662
And you're a loving person
who deserves love.

00:10.706 --> 00:13.665
REBECCA:
I need to counteract

00:13.709 --> 00:17.582
my systemic, socioeconomic,
racial and cisgener advantages.

00:17.626 --> 00:20.063
Oh, you mean that?

00:20.107 --> 00:21.934
I am applying
to law school!

00:23.501 --> 00:26.026
PAULA: I'm old.
Maybe-maybe it's too late.

00:26.069 --> 00:28.115
Maybe this whole law school
thing is dumb, okay?

00:28.158 --> 00:31.422
It's not dumb.
Your dreams are not dumb.

00:31.466 --> 00:34.425
The first second I came here,
you've been so nice to me.

00:34.469 --> 00:37.037
This is a joke.
You're a joke, Bert.

00:37.080 --> 00:39.343
I know that me being here
is not your first choice,

00:39.387 --> 00:41.215
but... you're
stuck with me.

00:41.258 --> 00:43.913
HEATHER: Hector and I
bought a condo in El Segundo,

00:43.956 --> 00:45.784
so... we're moving.

00:45.828 --> 00:47.873
I'm moving to New York.

00:47.917 --> 00:50.224
I am worried that your
body spray is gonna

00:50.267 --> 00:51.964
waft into her room and she's
gonna know that you're here,

00:52.008 --> 00:55.316
so leave... without wafting.

00:55.359 --> 00:57.840
Someone asked me to change
the water cooler on the way in.

00:57.883 --> 00:58.884

00:59.494 --> 01:02.584

VALENCIA:
Guys, I am so NYC right now.

01:43.755 --> 01:47.368
My apartment is tiny...

01:47.411 --> 01:48.934
but I've got this great couch

01:48.978 --> 01:50.284
that you can pull out
to be a bed,

01:50.327 --> 01:51.850
then a desk...Wow.

01:51.894 --> 01:53.765
...then a dining room table,
and then a Pilates reformer.

01:53.809 --> 01:55.767
Ooh, très chic!

01:55.811 --> 01:57.291
It's like your little
first-class cabin.

01:57.334 --> 01:59.902
Exactly. Especially since
the bathroom is down the hall

01:59.945 --> 02:02.078
and you share it
with ten other people.Yeah.

02:02.122 --> 02:03.993
Guys, I love
having you both available

02:04.036 --> 02:05.342
at the touch of a button.

02:05.386 --> 02:08.606
Yay, technology,
bridging the endless divides.

02:08.650 --> 02:11.479
Well, I'm at Home Base,
just 2.4 miles from you, so...

02:11.522 --> 02:12.915
VALENCIA:
Anyway,

02:12.958 --> 02:14.569
how are you, Rebecca?
Is today group therapy day?

02:14.612 --> 02:18.094
No, V, her group is Thursday,
individual therapy is Friday,

02:18.138 --> 02:19.356
equestrian share circle is...

02:19.400 --> 02:22.054
Wednesday, and horses
give me a rash now,

02:22.098 --> 02:23.317
so I don't even think
I'm gonna go anymore.

02:23.360 --> 02:24.448
God, this is exhausting.

02:24.492 --> 02:26.058
Guys, I know all this
emotional work

02:26.102 --> 02:27.669
is necessary and productive,

02:27.712 --> 02:29.540
but I'm excited
to have a day off.

02:29.584 --> 02:31.890
For 24 hours, I don't want to
talk about my feelings

02:31.934 --> 02:33.631
or my problems
or my personality disorder.

02:33.675 --> 02:35.416
And I know just
what I want to do today.

02:35.459 --> 02:36.895
So, I was on Instagram,

02:36.939 --> 02:39.420
and I found this place
called Harry's Hog Shop,

02:39.463 --> 02:41.117
it's this BBQ place in Irvine...

02:41.161 --> 02:42.684
Oh, I love that place.

02:42.727 --> 02:45.687
I peep at their Instagram
all day; it's pure food porn.

02:45.730 --> 02:47.645
I really want to
bone those ribs.

02:47.689 --> 02:50.648
Awesome. So let's go!
Let's go get some treif.

02:50.692 --> 02:54.304
Man, I can't. I'm working today
at two diff HB's. Ugh, sorry.

02:54.348 --> 02:55.958
You should call Paula.

02:56.001 --> 02:57.481
Isn't that what you guys
like to do together?

02:57.525 --> 02:59.483
Eat food for fun
instead of fuel?

02:59.527 --> 03:01.224
REBECCA:
No, she's studying today.

03:01.268 --> 03:03.357
Poop.Oh, I know.

03:03.400 --> 03:05.359
What about the rest of
your old Whitefeather crew?

03:05.402 --> 03:06.403
You could go with one of them?

03:06.447 --> 03:08.405
Oh, that's a good idea.

03:08.449 --> 03:10.755
I don't really spend much time
with any of them anymore

03:10.799 --> 03:12.409
and no one really
knows me well enough

03:12.453 --> 03:13.802
to get into the heavy stuff.

03:13.845 --> 03:17.719
Yeah, I'll just fire up
that old work text chain.

03:26.554 --> 03:28.382
And send.

03:28.425 --> 03:30.253
HEATHER: Hold on.
Wait a second, Rebecca.

03:30.297 --> 03:33.256
Is, um, Darryl
on that text chain?

03:33.300 --> 03:34.866
Yeah.Ugh. Darryl, right.

03:34.910 --> 03:36.868
My bad. Listen, if you're
looking to keep it light,

03:36.912 --> 03:39.262
he's not your person.
He's so emo.

03:39.306 --> 03:42.265
Yeah, love him, but he is a
"have a feeling, say a feeling"

03:42.309 --> 03:43.310
kind of guy.

03:43.353 --> 03:44.789
It'll be fine.
Even if he comes,

03:44.833 --> 03:46.313
there will be a ton
of other people there.

03:46.356 --> 03:48.576
It's all good.
And he's my friend.

03:48.619 --> 03:51.056
He'll be fine if I just
explain to him what I want.

03:51.100 --> 03:54.146
I don't know, can you really ask
people to be notwho they are?

03:54.190 --> 03:59.282
Especially someone
who is so... um, Darryl.

03:59.326 --> 04:02.546
Ugh.DARRYL: Doing baby laundry
makes me want to cry.

04:02.590 --> 04:03.982
Look at her little socks.

04:04.026 --> 04:06.333
She's already getting too
big for some of them.

04:06.376 --> 04:08.117
God, time flies, Evelyn.

04:08.160 --> 04:09.684
I feel like I'm
already losing her.

04:09.727 --> 04:11.512
Oh, let me
do that, Darryl.

04:11.555 --> 04:14.906
I'm the nanny.
It's what I do.

04:14.950 --> 04:17.039
You've been home every day
since I started.

04:17.082 --> 04:18.345
The point of hiring me

04:18.388 --> 04:20.608
is so that you can
get your life started again.

04:20.651 --> 04:22.697
See friends, have fun.

04:22.740 --> 04:24.916
Okay. I guess you're right.

04:24.960 --> 04:26.962
It's just, who
would I go with?

04:27.005 --> 04:28.529
Where would I go?

04:30.574 --> 04:35.144
I missed a text. Huh.

04:35.187 --> 04:36.928
Yum!

04:36.972 --> 04:38.495
REBECCA:
Ugh. AJ, listen to this

04:38.539 --> 04:39.975
parade of no's.

04:40.018 --> 04:42.717
George: "Did you mean to
send this to me? If yes, no."

04:42.760 --> 04:45.589
Bert: "Not allowed within
the Irvine city limits."

04:45.633 --> 04:48.940
Maya: "Eek, sorry, can't.
In Solvang with Emma Watson."

04:48.984 --> 04:51.378
Oh, yeah.Who says "eek, sorry" anyway?

04:51.421 --> 04:52.596
Ooh, AJ, can you come?

04:52.640 --> 04:54.206
Eek, sorry. I'm working.

04:54.250 --> 04:56.383
For you. Right now.
In front of you.

04:56.426 --> 04:58.472
Oh, right. Boo.If you're looking for fun,

04:58.515 --> 05:00.300
why not go on the apps?

05:00.343 --> 05:02.214
You haven't been on a date
since I started working here

05:02.258 --> 05:04.434
and you're afraid
your hymen is coming back.

05:04.478 --> 05:05.435
Wait, how'd you know that?

05:05.479 --> 05:07.350
You told me. Repeatedly.

05:07.394 --> 05:09.831
I was gonna report it to HR,
but you are HR.

05:09.874 --> 05:12.660
And AJ, I just
can't go on the apps.

05:12.703 --> 05:14.531
I only attract toxic
or unavailable men,

05:14.575 --> 05:16.446
then I fall for them.
It's... a whole thing.

05:16.490 --> 05:18.361
I should tell you
about it sometime, oof.

05:18.405 --> 05:20.755
You've told me about it. You've
done nothing but talk about it.

05:20.798 --> 05:22.583
I was actually gonna
report that, too.

05:22.626 --> 05:24.498
God, why is this so hard?

05:24.541 --> 05:27.501
I just want to share a fun
and carefree car trip

05:27.544 --> 05:29.024
and some smoked meats
with someone

05:29.067 --> 05:30.504
who's a super chill hang.

05:33.333 --> 05:35.509
Oh...

05:35.552 --> 05:37.815
Darryl's in.
Huh?

05:37.859 --> 05:39.643
You said
you wanted a chill hang.

05:39.687 --> 05:41.297
That's not Darryl.

05:41.341 --> 05:43.386
We only met once and ended up
spending the whole time

05:43.430 --> 05:45.475
talking about our mothers
and crying our eyes out.

05:45.519 --> 05:46.737
Dude is extra.

05:46.781 --> 05:49.479
Well, AJ, everyone else said no.

05:49.523 --> 05:50.785
So Darryl is what I got.

05:50.828 --> 05:52.787
And it's gonna work.
It has to.

05:52.830 --> 05:55.529
I need this day.

06:03.406 --> 06:05.190
Oh, there you are.

06:05.234 --> 06:06.801
Thought you were studying
for your finals.

06:06.844 --> 06:09.412
Well, I was about to. In here.

06:09.456 --> 06:10.979
In my new office.

06:11.022 --> 06:14.591
Um, but I couldn't get started
because something's missing.

06:14.635 --> 06:16.071
Your butt in a chair?

06:16.114 --> 06:18.595
No. A desk.

06:18.639 --> 06:19.901
I need a desk.

06:19.944 --> 06:22.556
I need to study for finals
and soon, the bar,

06:22.599 --> 06:26.429
and to do that I need a proper,
lawyerly desk.

06:26.473 --> 06:29.171
I'm gonna be a lawyer.

06:29.214 --> 06:30.868
A lawyer, Scott.

06:30.912 --> 06:33.218
Well, you've worked so hard.
You're almost there, babe.

06:33.262 --> 06:35.003
Sometimes I can't believe it.

06:35.046 --> 06:37.397
I mean, you know,
my dad always-- hold on.

06:37.440 --> 06:39.311
Let's not restrict this
just to my dad.

06:39.355 --> 06:43.620
Everyone said that I would end
up nothing but a baby factory

06:43.664 --> 06:45.448
and yet here I am,

06:45.492 --> 06:48.843
about to introduce myself
to the world as an attorney.

06:48.886 --> 06:52.063
And all I need to do
to get to that monumental,

06:52.107 --> 06:53.630
not-at-all scary place

06:53.674 --> 06:55.110
is study.

06:55.153 --> 06:56.459
Hence, a desk.

06:56.503 --> 06:57.678
We have that folding table
in the garage.

06:57.721 --> 06:59.114
I'll get it.

06:59.157 --> 07:01.246
A folding table?
Come on. Scott, no.

07:01.290 --> 07:04.075
I have found the perfect desk.

07:04.119 --> 07:07.644
It is gorgeous, and it totally
says "big-time lawyer lady."

07:07.688 --> 07:10.430
The only problem is that
it is in San Bernardino

07:10.473 --> 07:12.083
and it is too big
for our minivan,

07:12.127 --> 07:17.088
so I found an app called...
"Bro With A Truck."

07:17.132 --> 07:19.439
They send a bro
with a pickup,

07:19.482 --> 07:24.748
and I'm pretty excited
because my bro is Driver 78.

07:24.792 --> 07:27.490
He has a five-star
rating, he likes music,

07:27.534 --> 07:32.364
is a Pisces, and he scuba dived
off the Great Barrier Reef.

07:32.408 --> 07:34.758
Sounds like you're going on
a date with him or something.

07:34.802 --> 07:36.368
Tanya!

07:36.412 --> 07:39.459
Have a great day. Hope it's
a great desk, you deserve it.

07:39.502 --> 07:43.114
God, I love that.
Still remains a tasty move.

07:45.203 --> 07:48.293
Here is your burger
and cabbage.

07:48.337 --> 07:51.688
I call it the "No One
Wants That," so...

07:51.732 --> 07:53.777
Okay, you're welcome. Did you
want anything to drink?

07:53.821 --> 07:55.039
Yes, water.

07:55.083 --> 07:57.694
Yes, water, please
and thank you.

07:57.738 --> 07:58.565
If you say so.

07:58.608 --> 08:00.131
Ah.

08:03.265 --> 08:06.094
Hey, Nathaniel.

08:06.137 --> 08:07.748
I went to your house
but you weren't there,

08:07.791 --> 08:10.490
so I called all of the dining
establishments in the city

08:10.533 --> 08:11.665
until I found you.

08:11.708 --> 08:13.188
Why?Oh, some mail came

08:13.231 --> 08:14.668
for you at the
office yesterday,

08:14.711 --> 08:17.235
so I thought I'd bring it to you
the way, you know,

08:17.279 --> 08:18.759
coworkers with a good rapport

08:18.802 --> 08:21.544
bring things to each other
on Saturdays.

08:21.588 --> 08:23.503
Uh-oh.

08:23.546 --> 08:26.593
Burger salad.
Are you in trouble?

08:26.636 --> 08:29.596
My grandmother used to make that
for me and my seven sisters

08:29.639 --> 08:30.814
when we were bad.

08:30.858 --> 08:32.294
Great. Mail. Cool.

08:32.337 --> 08:35.645
Okay, you got me.
The mail was a pretext.

08:35.689 --> 08:38.648
I wanted to spend some
out-of-office time with you.

08:38.692 --> 08:40.650
We started off on
the wrong foot.

08:40.694 --> 08:42.696
I'd-I'd really like to
get to know each other.

08:42.739 --> 08:44.741
Huh. I don't want to do that.

08:44.785 --> 08:46.177
But I-I do want to do that.

08:54.969 --> 08:59.800
But... all right,
m-maybe some other time.

08:59.843 --> 09:01.279
Bye-bye.

09:03.368 --> 09:05.283
Here you go.
I'm sorry.

09:05.327 --> 09:07.503
He's so rude. I kind of
just think that's who he is.

09:07.547 --> 09:09.244
He dated one of
my best friends

09:09.287 --> 09:11.463
and he was also randomly
at my wedding

09:11.507 --> 09:13.204
because my husband
is his surf instructor.

09:13.248 --> 09:16.947
But I've always never liked him.
I think he's kind of a dick.

09:16.991 --> 09:18.470
I don't know.
I think he's just

09:18.514 --> 09:20.298
not very open emotionally,
because he's sad

09:20.342 --> 09:21.691
about some things in his life.

09:21.735 --> 09:22.953
I get it.

09:22.997 --> 09:24.476
When my seven sisters died

09:24.520 --> 09:26.522
in that tragic
tandem bike accident,

09:26.566 --> 09:30.265
it took me 14 years to deal
with it, to even cry.

09:30.308 --> 09:32.876
One good cry
and that young man...

09:32.920 --> 09:34.443
well, he'll probably
have a ways to go,

09:34.486 --> 09:37.620
but, I don't know,
maybe it'll work.

09:37.664 --> 09:39.970
I just think he's broken.

09:40.014 --> 09:41.842
I'm so sorry about your sisters.

09:41.885 --> 09:43.191
Thank you.Yeah.

09:43.234 --> 09:46.063
Ooh, you should have
seen the mess.

09:46.107 --> 09:48.805
Boom!

09:48.849 --> 09:51.068
Hello?

09:53.810 --> 09:56.813
MAN: Driver 78 is here!

09:58.336 --> 10:00.556
P-P-P-Paula!

10:00.600 --> 10:02.689
It is you.

10:02.732 --> 10:05.692
Customer 99 is you. Yes!

10:05.735 --> 10:07.650
You It's not you.

10:07.694 --> 10:09.130
You don't scuba dive.

10:09.173 --> 10:12.437
Uh, yeah, I scuba-did.
When I was ten, I scuba-doved.

10:12.481 --> 10:14.396
That's not-- scuba-dove...

10:14.439 --> 10:17.355
I-I thought you had another job.
You're a DJ.

10:17.399 --> 10:18.661
Yeah, that's at night.

10:18.705 --> 10:20.707
During the day I like to
pick up some extra cash.

10:20.750 --> 10:22.839
Plus, Hector's mom likes me
to be out of the house

10:22.883 --> 10:26.103
during the day; that's when she
Jacuzzis and edits the podcast.

10:26.147 --> 10:27.888
Well, that's good.
I mean, you're saving up money

10:27.931 --> 10:29.106
to move out of her house, then.

10:29.150 --> 10:31.108
What? No. I'm not moving out.

10:31.152 --> 10:33.110
Though we could
use a bigger place

10:33.154 --> 10:34.851
and we do dream about owning.

10:34.895 --> 10:38.638
Wow. Josh...

10:38.681 --> 10:43.555
I am, I am, as always,
amazed at your utter Joshness.

10:43.599 --> 10:45.035
Thanks.Look,

10:45.079 --> 10:47.951
I just don't know
if I can do this today.

10:47.995 --> 10:50.040
I thought I was gonna
spend the day with a stranger.

10:50.084 --> 10:53.696
And maybe I should just
get another driver.

10:53.740 --> 10:54.697
Do-do it tomorrow.

10:54.741 --> 10:56.046
Cancellation fee is $200.

10:56.090 --> 10:58.701
Okay, let's go.

10:58.745 --> 11:00.877
Damn it!

11:00.921 --> 11:03.706
♪ Everybody's
falling for each other ♪

11:03.750 --> 11:05.839
♪ Bom-bom, bom,

11:08.058 --> 11:09.581
Nathaniel?

11:09.625 --> 11:11.975
:
What?

11:16.240 --> 11:19.026
Uh, what happened?

11:19.069 --> 11:20.854
I forgot to charge my car
and now I'm out of juice.

11:20.897 --> 11:22.159
I've been trying
to get an Uber,

11:22.203 --> 11:24.466
but these idiot drivers
keep canceling on me.

11:24.509 --> 11:26.686
Huh. You must have
a bad rating.

11:26.729 --> 11:28.426
The ratings go both ways?

11:28.470 --> 11:29.993
Socialists.

11:30.037 --> 11:31.081
Okay, good catching up, bye-bye.

11:31.125 --> 11:32.735
No, wait, wait, wait.
Um... Uh...

11:32.779 --> 11:34.171
can I have a ride?

11:36.173 --> 11:38.045
Ugh, sorry.

11:38.088 --> 11:41.352
Can I have a ride,
please and thank you?

11:47.184 --> 11:49.012
Look at you!

11:49.056 --> 11:53.234
You look like a small-town
mayor at a 1970s rodeo.

11:53.277 --> 11:54.365
Or, oh, you look like
the guy in the porno

11:54.409 --> 11:55.758
who goes, "Nancy,

11:55.802 --> 11:58.718
I want those oil reports
on my desk yesterday."

11:58.761 --> 12:00.415
Thank you.

12:00.458 --> 12:02.069
I go all-out for barbecue.
It's like I say:

12:02.112 --> 12:04.071
"It ain't a real meal

12:04.114 --> 12:06.334
unless you suit up
from hat to heel."

12:06.377 --> 12:08.118
Ha! That's funny.

12:08.162 --> 12:09.641
Oh, you're fun.

12:09.685 --> 12:11.121
And anyone who said
you would not be fun

12:11.165 --> 12:12.819
or would be super emo is wrong,

12:12.862 --> 12:14.255
because you're already rhyming

12:14.298 --> 12:15.822
and you're already
in a costume...

12:15.865 --> 12:16.910
Well, this is
not a costume...

12:16.953 --> 12:18.520
In an outfit
that screams "costume,"

12:18.563 --> 12:20.565
and we're just
gonna have fun, fun, fun.

12:20.609 --> 12:22.263
Hey, before then-- um,

12:22.306 --> 12:24.613
Darryl, you know I'm in
an extensive amount of therapy,

12:24.656 --> 12:26.267
and I have learned
in therapy

12:26.310 --> 12:27.485
to make my wishes clear.

12:27.529 --> 12:29.400
So I would like
to clearly say...

12:29.444 --> 12:32.273
I'm just looking for a fun,
easy breezy day,

12:32.316 --> 12:34.231
no heavy convos

12:34.275 --> 12:36.146
Yep. No problem.

12:36.190 --> 12:37.931
Aw, look at us.

12:37.974 --> 12:39.759
Me and you, heading out
on the open road,

12:39.802 --> 12:41.586
two old friends that...

12:41.630 --> 12:43.414
have been through
so much together...

12:44.502 --> 12:46.069
Yep, that's not
what you want.

12:46.113 --> 12:47.984
I will not
do that again.

12:48.028 --> 12:49.290
All right. Let's go.

12:49.333 --> 12:51.553
Okeydokey, pokey.

13:04.044 --> 13:05.828
JOSH:
So therapy has given me
a whole new perspective

13:05.872 --> 13:07.830
on the world, a
whole new vocabulary

13:07.874 --> 13:09.310
for talking about
my feelings,

13:09.353 --> 13:10.920
also something to do
on Monday nights, huh?

13:12.313 --> 13:14.097
That's nice, Josh.
Good for you.

13:14.141 --> 13:16.447
Yeah, I think some of my issues
started with potty training.

13:16.491 --> 13:17.666
My mother bribed
me with candy,

13:17.709 --> 13:19.799
so I wasn't
internally motivated.

13:19.842 --> 13:22.627
I mean, you really need to
start with what's inside

13:22.671 --> 13:24.586
and then go outside.
At least...

13:24.629 --> 13:26.109
...got hard candy
if I went number one,

13:26.153 --> 13:27.850
I got chocolate
if I did number two,

13:27.894 --> 13:29.330
which I thought
was kind of funny,

13:29.373 --> 13:31.375
because, like, chocolate.
Oh, that reminds me--

13:31.419 --> 13:32.812
being picked first for kickball

13:32.855 --> 13:36.728
every single time was at
once an honor and a burden,

13:36.772 --> 13:39.601
and created a kind of
split in my psyche.

13:39.644 --> 13:41.821
I mean, it's not that difficult of a difference.

13:41.864 --> 13:44.040
Okay-- shotokan, tae kwon do.

13:44.084 --> 13:47.478
...need to count in Korean--
hana, dul, set, net, dasol,

13:47.522 --> 13:49.872
yasot, iilgup, yodol.
And then Japanese is

13:49.916 --> 13:53.223
ichi, ni, san, shi, go, roku,
shichi, hachi, kyuu, juu.

13:53.267 --> 13:54.877
I get 'em confused,
sometimes,

13:54.921 --> 13:56.705
but it's really
not hard at all.

13:56.748 --> 13:59.708
When I was working at Aloha,
I felt so trapped

13:59.751 --> 14:01.928
in that back office.
Sometimes literally,

14:01.971 --> 14:04.104
because Alex would put
boxes in front of the door,

14:04.147 --> 14:05.583
and that sucked.

14:05.627 --> 14:06.846
No, sorry.

14:06.889 --> 14:09.370
That made me feel
sucked. Ugh.

14:09.413 --> 14:10.850
Josh, what?

14:10.893 --> 14:12.373
Oh, yeah.

14:12.416 --> 14:13.765
You're not in therapy.

14:13.809 --> 14:15.811
You don't get the lingo.

14:15.855 --> 14:17.030
Well, what's the lingo for,

14:17.073 --> 14:19.206
"For the love of God,
please stop talking"?

14:19.249 --> 14:21.861
I think it's, "Let's sit
with that for a minute."

14:21.904 --> 14:23.775
Right.Dr. A says that a lot.

14:23.819 --> 14:25.995
Mm

14:26.039 --> 14:28.824
Anyway, what's so special about
this desk that you got to go

14:28.868 --> 14:30.347
all the way out
to San Bernardino?

14:30.391 --> 14:32.175
There's got to be some good
desks closer to home...

14:32.219 --> 14:35.091
Josh... I don't want to talk.

14:40.880 --> 14:43.926
So I'll just drop you off
at your apartment, or...?

14:43.970 --> 14:45.014
No, I'm going to Santa Monica.

14:45.058 --> 14:46.450
Santa Monica, pronto.

14:46.494 --> 14:47.887
What?

14:47.930 --> 14:49.932
Oh, God. Sorry.

14:49.976 --> 14:52.848
Santa Monica, please, pronto.

14:52.892 --> 14:55.416
Oh, wow, you're a
real piece of work.

14:55.459 --> 14:57.897
You're asking to be
chauffeured to the beach?

14:57.940 --> 15:00.464
You've got a
lot of nerve.

15:00.508 --> 15:02.249
But lucky for you,
I am headed

15:02.292 --> 15:04.860
to the El Segundo Home Base,
which is at the beach,

15:04.904 --> 15:08.342
so it's basically on the way and
also I'm a really nice person.

15:08.385 --> 15:10.779
Okay. Thank you.

15:10.822 --> 15:12.955
Wow, "thank you"-- we're
really getting somewhere.

15:12.999 --> 15:15.958
God, this car...
is disgusting.

15:16.002 --> 15:18.526
This is like an old
mobile garbage can.

15:18.569 --> 15:19.962
How do you live like this

15:20.006 --> 15:21.137
There's nothing
wrong with this car.

15:21.181 --> 15:22.965
It gets me where
I need to go

15:23.009 --> 15:25.402
and I have access to all of my
belongings, which is great.

15:25.446 --> 15:27.143
Okay.Also, it's none
of your business.

15:27.187 --> 15:28.623
Cool. Well, if I need
a dirty shirt

15:28.666 --> 15:31.495
or an empty water bottle
or hair scrunchies,What...

15:31.539 --> 15:32.932
I'm good to go.

15:32.975 --> 15:34.063
Oh, yeah, 'cause
I'm the weird one.

15:34.107 --> 15:35.586
Why are you clutching
that envelope?

15:35.630 --> 15:37.066
This envelope
is not your concern.

15:37.110 --> 15:39.939
Just drive, please.
Thank you. Pronto.

15:39.982 --> 15:42.898
Fine, but your rating
is gonna be a zero, so...

15:47.424 --> 15:49.992
It's a lovely day
to eat some ribs, right?

15:50.036 --> 15:51.472
Yeah, it's a beautiful day.Mm.

15:51.515 --> 15:53.996
So, you talk to Valencia
and Heather lately?Uh-huh.

15:54.040 --> 15:56.085
They're doing great, right?Yeah.

15:56.129 --> 15:58.653
Must be hard that
they moved away.

15:58.696 --> 16:01.003
How's that make you feel?
Heart hurting?

16:01.047 --> 16:02.874
Oh, sorry.

16:02.918 --> 16:04.398
No, I-I did it.
I see that.

16:04.441 --> 16:06.356
It's okay. You
made a mistake.

16:06.400 --> 16:08.837
We all make mistakes,
God knows I do. It's fine.

16:08.880 --> 16:11.187
Um, let's do something fun.
Let's sing a car song.

16:11.231 --> 16:13.537
Oh, I know a great car song,
let me teach you. It goes...

16:13.581 --> 16:15.017
: "This song
goes in a loop-de-loop.

16:15.061 --> 16:16.540
:
I love car songs.It starts... The...

16:16.584 --> 16:17.715
I love 'em.Oh.

16:17.759 --> 16:19.891
They remind me
of my childhood.

16:19.935 --> 16:21.502
What was your childhood like?

16:21.545 --> 16:23.286
Oh, was it tough?

16:23.330 --> 16:25.985
Oh, tell me your-your first sad
memory that you can think of.

16:27.638 --> 16:29.945
Hey, Darryl, just...
can we not?

16:29.989 --> 16:31.338
I'm begging you.

16:31.381 --> 16:32.948
Just... can we not?

16:32.992 --> 16:34.994
My bad.Thank you.

16:48.094 --> 16:51.314
Hey... could you not
do that either?

16:51.358 --> 16:53.360

20:33.841 --> 20:35.930
WOMAN:
So you need a desk for studying!

20:35.973 --> 20:38.193
How wonderful.

20:38.237 --> 20:39.107
What are you studying for?

20:39.150 --> 20:40.674
Uh, law school finals.

20:40.717 --> 20:42.066
I mean, I haven't started yet.

20:42.110 --> 20:43.981
I need the right desk.
You get it.

20:44.025 --> 20:46.680
No, not really.
But I-I do my bills

20:46.723 --> 20:49.204
standing over a sink
eating a ripe grapefruit.

20:49.248 --> 20:51.250
Saves a plate.

20:52.860 --> 20:56.211
Oh. You need this desk
for your finals, Paula?

20:56.255 --> 20:58.866
Wow, what an important
errand I'm on.

20:58.909 --> 21:00.259
So honored.

21:00.302 --> 21:02.304
All right, let's get
this puppy in the truck

21:02.348 --> 21:03.958
and get you studying ASAP.

21:04.001 --> 21:06.308
Now I...

21:06.352 --> 21:09.137
Wow, this whole thing
is just gonna take 90 minutes.

21:09.180 --> 21:10.878
That's so fast.

21:10.921 --> 21:13.489
Oh, wait a second.
Hold on a second. Uh-oh.

21:13.533 --> 21:15.274
There's a scratch here.WOMAN: Really?

21:15.317 --> 21:17.145
I-I don't see how.

21:17.188 --> 21:20.453
I stored it away from
my leopard and my anteaters.

21:22.542 --> 21:24.544
Uh, no, I mean, well,
look right here.

21:24.587 --> 21:27.851
It's a big old scratch that
wasn't in the photos,

21:27.895 --> 21:32.073
so because it wasn't previously
disclosed-- lawyer term--

21:32.116 --> 21:35.337
um, it's just not gonna work out
for me, Mrs. Beattie, I'm sorry.

21:35.381 --> 21:37.252
But, um, that's okay,

21:37.296 --> 21:39.036
because I was looking at
another desk.

21:39.080 --> 21:41.212
It's in San Diego, and if
we take all the right freeways,

21:41.256 --> 21:42.301
it's only three hours.

21:42.344 --> 21:44.520
No, Paula, you
need this desk now.

21:44.564 --> 21:47.349
It's an important step
to you becoming a lawyer.

21:47.393 --> 21:50.309
Don't worry, this won't
hold us up. I got this.

21:50.352 --> 21:52.615
I brought a wood finishing pen
in case there were any dings

21:52.659 --> 21:54.182
or nicks in the
moving process.

21:54.225 --> 21:58.099
Oh, well, aren't you...
clever.

21:58.142 --> 22:00.928
JOSH:
See, works like a charm.

22:02.364 --> 22:05.802
Wow, it really does.
Well done.

22:05.846 --> 22:07.282
So let's load it
in the truck.

22:07.326 --> 22:08.631
Well, n-no,
we can't go now.

22:08.675 --> 22:11.242
I mean, that would be rude.
We just got here

22:11.286 --> 22:13.332
and I'm sure Mrs. Beattie
wants to show us

22:13.375 --> 22:16.247
all of her beautiful
trash... sures.

22:16.291 --> 22:18.293
Oh, excuse me, honey.

22:18.337 --> 22:21.383
You really want to hear all
about my wonderful belongings?

22:21.427 --> 22:24.691
PAULA: Yeah.BEATTIE:
Well, this owl right here...

22:24.734 --> 22:27.607
PAULA: Has no eyes.BEATTIE:
I don't like them looking at me.

22:31.350 --> 22:34.614
So, the whole ride,
you're just not gonna tell me

22:34.657 --> 22:36.093
why you're cuddling
a puffy envelope

22:36.137 --> 22:37.834
like a toddler clutching
a stuffed animal?

22:37.878 --> 22:39.401
Why do you care?Oh, I don't.

22:39.445 --> 22:41.229
I'm just annoyed that
you won't tell me.

22:41.272 --> 22:42.796
I mean, you were
at my wedding.

22:42.839 --> 22:44.450
:
So what?

22:44.493 --> 22:46.277
So that, like, bonds us.

22:46.321 --> 22:47.844
It really doesn't.

22:47.888 --> 22:49.629
I was at Kate Middleton's
wedding

22:49.672 --> 22:51.108
and we barely speak
anymore.

22:51.152 --> 22:52.632
Okay.

22:55.635 --> 22:58.420
Why is your car
making weird noises?

22:58.464 --> 23:00.944
Oh, yeah. Those aren't weird.

23:00.988 --> 23:02.293
I know exactly what those are.

23:02.337 --> 23:03.904
It happens every 12 miles or so.

23:03.947 --> 23:06.950
I just duct tape the coolant
hose and then I'm good to go.

23:06.994 --> 23:10.911
Wow.
Crafty. Very Etsy.

23:10.954 --> 23:12.521
Mm-hmm. Yep.

23:12.565 --> 23:15.394
I am gonna pull over though,
'cause this is pretty dangerous,

Yes.

No, it-it's just
a regular day.

23:40.593 --> 23:42.464
Uh, he's being
a little extra right now.

23:42.508 --> 23:43.987
Oh.What does that mean?

Yeah, as long as I don't
talk about any heavy stuff.

24:01.831 --> 24:03.093
doesn't want to
hear about us.

24:03.137 --> 24:04.617
Yeah, you see,
she's been through a lot;

24:04.660 --> 24:05.705
she has a disorder.

24:05.748 --> 24:07.358
Oh, my God, Darryl,
will you stop?

24:07.402 --> 24:08.534
I'm sorry.

24:08.577 --> 24:10.884
Why are you mad?

24:10.927 --> 24:12.668
You know why I'm mad.

24:12.712 --> 24:15.454
I just wanted to have a fun day.

24:15.497 --> 24:16.759
Why is that too much to ask?

24:16.803 --> 24:18.369
I tried. I was trying.

24:18.413 --> 24:19.196
Okay, well, not hard enough.

24:19.240 --> 24:21.068
You know what?

24:21.111 --> 24:22.939
Let's just go.
This was a bad idea.

24:22.983 --> 24:24.375
It's not your fault.

24:24.419 --> 24:27.335
You just happen to be everything
I didn't want today.

24:28.597 --> 24:30.947
I'm sorry. I-I
didn't mean that.

24:30.991 --> 24:32.514
Yeah, you did.
Okay.

Let's just,
let's just leave.

24:33.950 --> 24:36.779
No. No, no. I'm not about to
get into a car with you.

24:36.823 --> 24:39.695

the first day away from Hebby

24:39.739 --> 24:41.218
to be with you.Darryl,

24:41.262 --> 24:43.177
come on.You know,
sometimes I think we're close,

24:43.220 --> 24:45.135
like when you give me parts
of your genetic code

24:45.179 --> 24:46.876
to make a person,
but sometimes it feels like

24:46.920 --> 24:48.835
you just don't like me.

24:48.878 --> 24:49.966
And I look past it,

24:50.010 --> 24:52.491
because I like
the good parts of you,

24:52.534 --> 24:54.405
and I know
you have some challenges,

24:54.449 --> 24:57.713
but that is no excuse
for you to be unkind.

25:09.551 --> 25:10.552
BEATTIE:
And this is Terrence.

25:10.596 --> 25:12.423

with a shovel

25:14.730 --> 25:17.124

25:17.167 --> 25:20.780
Actually, I think it's in
this candy tin right here.

we got to go.
