00:02.750 --> 00:03.750
(J.D.) <i>The worst thing about Elliot</i>

00:03.834 --> 00:05.458
<i>having picked</i>
<i>my annoying intern Keith</i>

00:05.542 --> 00:08.166
<i>as her permanent booty call</i>
<i>is that if he's had a few beers,</i>

00:08.250 --> 00:11.208
<i>he sometimes forget</i>
<i>which bedroom is hers.</i>

00:13.208 --> 00:14.750
I'm here, lover.

00:15.583 --> 00:16.834
Tender.

00:20.667 --> 00:22.792
In my defense,
Keith's a decent kisser

00:22.875 --> 00:26.417
and anyone waking up that way
would let out a pleasure moan.

00:26.500 --> 00:28.208
Same thing happened
to me in college.

00:28.291 --> 00:31.458
Really? What guy drunkenly kissed
you while you were sleeping?

00:31.542 --> 00:33.917
(J.D.) <i>And it was at that moment</i>
<i>that Turk and I remembered</i>

00:34.000 --> 00:37.000
<i>the incident we managed</i>
<i>to block out for 12 years.</i>

00:37.083 --> 00:38.667
You ok with us not hanging out
for a couple of weeks?

00:38.750 --> 00:41.250
-Totally.
-Ok.

00:41.333 --> 00:42.375
(J.D.) <i>I was gonna miss Turk,</i>

00:42.458 --> 00:45.166
<i>but luckily my favorite intern</i>
<i>was around to cheer me up.</i>

00:45.250 --> 00:48.792
<i>Jason Cabaggio, or as I had</i>
<i>brilliantly nicknamed him...</i>

00:48.875 --> 00:51.250
-Cabbage!
-Yes, sir!

00:51.333 --> 00:54.125
Mark, I wasn't talking to you.
I was talking to cabbage.

00:54.208 --> 00:56.208
Well, my last name
is Cabbage.

00:56.291 --> 00:58.333
I know that, but
I've nicknamed you wolfman

00:58.417 --> 01:00.166
because of your keen
sense of smell.

01:01.125 --> 01:04.000
(J.D.)
<i>And your ridiculously hairy torso.</i>

01:04.083 --> 01:05.667
Now, what can I do you for?

01:05.750 --> 01:08.458
Dr. D., is the I.V.
supposed to leak like this?

01:09.000 --> 01:11.333
Well, yes and no.
Mostly no. Really all no.

01:11.417 --> 01:13.041
But don't worry.
I got your back.

01:13.125 --> 01:15.959
First thing is,
take a little nip for yourself.

01:16.041 --> 01:17.750
Got some on you.
Look out!

01:17.834 --> 01:19.542
That's some of the fun
that you can have.

01:19.625 --> 01:22.458
But no, seriously, just watch
and learn. Watch and learn.

01:22.542 --> 01:24.375
It's an honor
to watch you work, sir.

01:24.458 --> 01:27.500
Take it all in, cabbage.
Take it all in.

01:27.583 --> 01:30.208
(J.D.) <i>Yes, I like some</i>
<i>interns more than others.</i>

01:30.291 --> 01:33.750
<i>But I never let personal feelings</i>
<i>affect my professional behavior.</i>

01:33.834 --> 01:35.250
You're late, Keith.

01:35.333 --> 01:37.709
Which doesn't surprise me
because you're a bad person.

01:37.792 --> 01:40.000
Sorry. They needed help with
a shooting victim downstairs.

01:40.083 --> 01:42.041
Lies will get you nowhere,
Keith.

01:42.125 --> 01:43.917
I'm covered in his blood.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.542
That could be anyone's blood.

01:45.625 --> 01:47.667
Here's the gunshot victim
from downstairs.

01:47.750 --> 01:49.500
Hey, look. My blood.

01:50.291 --> 01:52.208
-That's not your blood.
-Yes, it is.

01:52.291 --> 01:53.792
Quiet time.

01:57.542 --> 01:58.417
All right, listen.

01:58.500 --> 02:01.166
If Mr. Burton wants the surgery,
just call me on my celly.

02:01.250 --> 02:03.041
Cool. What's your number?

02:03.125 --> 02:04.667
You have my number.

02:04.750 --> 02:05.834
I don't. I changed phones.

02:05.917 --> 02:08.750
Oh. But you didn't switch out the
old numbers into the new phone?

02:08.834 --> 02:09.667
Yeah, but I decided

02:09.750 --> 02:12.417
I'd just put a couple
of emergency numbers on here.

02:13.667 --> 02:15.792
The butterball Turkey help line.

02:16.917 --> 02:19.208
This one just says
"that guy in the restaurant."

02:19.291 --> 02:22.041
Hey, I really clicked with that guy
in the restaurant, ok?

02:22.125 --> 02:25.709
We spent all night talking
about something. Ok?

02:25.792 --> 02:27.625
Turk, if I need you,
I can just call Carla.

02:27.709 --> 02:29.542
It's not like we hang out
just the two of us anymore.

02:29.625 --> 02:31.291
I bet you don't have
my number in your cell.

02:37.792 --> 02:39.333
(J.D.)
<i>Not even Keith could bum me out</i>

02:39.417 --> 02:41.917
<i>because everybody's</i>
<i>favorite patient, Mrs. Wilk,</i>

02:42.000 --> 02:43.166
<i>is going home today.</i>

02:43.250 --> 02:44.959
I'm sure not
gonna miss this food.

02:45.041 --> 02:47.333
Well, the nurses
and I got you this.

02:47.417 --> 02:48.667
-Oh!
-Huh?

02:48.750 --> 02:49.583
Aw.

02:49.667 --> 02:51.792
You should see the size
of the stationery store.

02:54.291 --> 02:56.208
(J.D.)
<i>That was a huge courtesy laugh</i>

02:56.291 --> 02:58.333
<i>because I was about to trump</i>
<i>Carla's good-bye gift</i>

02:58.417 --> 03:00.208
<i>like nobody's business.</i>

03:01.250 --> 03:04.000
Mrs. Wilk, I remember
how much you like basketball,

03:04.083 --> 03:08.041
so I got you a DVD of the NBA's
greatest centers of all time,

03:08.125 --> 03:10.250
signed by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.

03:10.333 --> 03:12.792
Oh, J.D., this is so sweet.

03:12.875 --> 03:15.041
(J.D.) <i>Winner!</i>

03:15.125 --> 03:16.542
My gift is in the same vein.

03:16.625 --> 03:18.166
Oh, is it, Keith?

03:18.250 --> 03:21.792
Mr. Abdul-Jabbar is
on my dad's flag football team.

03:21.875 --> 03:24.291
-Hi, Patricia.
-Oh!

03:25.500 --> 03:26.750
That's not my signature.

03:27.792 --> 03:30.375
-Did you sign this? It's illegal.
-Ok.

03:31.375 --> 03:35.000
Back to the psych ward,
Mr. Rosenberg. Crazy.

03:36.583 --> 03:40.125
<i>♪ I can't do this all on my own ♪</i>

03:40.208 --> 03:44.166
<i>♪ No, I know I'm no Superman ♪</i>

03:46.834 --> 03:48.458
<i>♪ I'm no Superman ♪</i>

03:51.250 --> 03:53.125
(J.D.) <i>That morning</i>
<i>seemed like any other.</i>

03:53.208 --> 03:54.625
<i>Dr. Mickhead was back,</i>

03:54.709 --> 03:57.000
<i>having beaten the rap</i>
<i>on murdering his spouse.</i>

03:57.083 --> 03:59.208
Anybody want
a cool prison jumpsuit?

04:02.166 --> 04:04.709
And Dr. Kelso was having
his daily staring contest

04:04.792 --> 04:08.041
with the last double chocolate
chocolate chip muffin.

04:08.125 --> 04:10.792
Let's end this charade.

04:10.875 --> 04:12.250
You win again.

04:12.333 --> 04:13.875
You always do.

04:19.083 --> 04:20.500
(squawks)

04:24.709 --> 04:29.041
Would someone explain what that bird
is doing in my hospital?

04:29.125 --> 04:33.500
Sanchez appears to be flying, sir.
I've named him Sanchez.

04:34.166 --> 04:35.667
He set up shop
in that old wreath there.

04:35.750 --> 04:36.583
I'd take it down,

04:36.667 --> 04:39.500
but the patients around here
really seem to love the little guy.

04:40.041 --> 04:43.917
That disease-invested scavenger
is a serious health risk.

04:44.000 --> 04:44.834
Oh.

04:44.917 --> 04:47.375
Do you know the number-one cause
of death in a hospital?

04:47.458 --> 04:48.917
-Your breath?
-Infection.

04:49.000 --> 04:52.166
And do you know how quickly
infection spreads in a hospital?

04:52.250 --> 04:54.208
-Your breath.
-That doesn't make sense.

04:54.291 --> 04:55.542
Don't care.

04:55.625 --> 04:59.709
Look infections can start
with a simple sneeze...

05:03.834 --> 05:05.542
and then a handshake.

05:07.083 --> 05:09.250
Perhaps an accidental collision.

05:13.125 --> 05:15.375
Then a simple touch
on the shoulder.

05:17.500 --> 05:20.500
And just like that,
you have a patient in trouble.

05:22.542 --> 05:24.458
Chinatown is awesome.

05:29.625 --> 05:31.291
I want that bird gone.

05:32.458 --> 05:33.792
Keith, I realize

05:33.875 --> 05:36.583
you'd like to be at your
grandmother's funeral on Saturday.

05:36.667 --> 05:37.875
Heck, we all would.

05:37.959 --> 05:40.667
But you can't just take
a day off whenever you feel like it.

05:40.750 --> 05:43.625
Then how come cabbage got Saturday
off so he can go see<i> King Kong?</i>

05:43.709 --> 05:46.500
Because, Keith, cabbage
is an ape enthusiast.

05:47.208 --> 05:48.583
Show him a little.

05:55.709 --> 05:58.458
It's like I'm at the zoo.

05:58.542 --> 06:00.250
Put the thing
in your mouth when you...

06:01.208 --> 06:02.500
Yeah.

06:03.875 --> 06:05.291
See you, Mrs. Wilk.

06:06.208 --> 06:07.875
I'm gonna miss you.

06:07.959 --> 06:10.166
I'm gonna miss
our late-night talks.

06:10.250 --> 06:12.583
You can call me
anytime you want, sweetie.

06:12.667 --> 06:15.500
Got your number right here
on the phone. Sorry.

06:15.583 --> 06:17.166
Don't even worry about it.

06:18.083 --> 06:19.125
It's ok.

06:19.208 --> 06:20.959
We are so not cool.

06:21.041 --> 06:24.000
We're not? Why are you making such a
big deal of this? It was a simple--

06:24.083 --> 06:27.959
La, la, la, la, la, la, la,
la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.

06:28.041 --> 06:31.250
(both) Mr. Burton! Hey!

06:31.333 --> 06:33.250
In a few minutes,
they'll be coming to get you

06:33.333 --> 06:35.000
for your Aorta Bifem bypass surgery.

06:35.083 --> 06:37.750
And if there's anything we can do
for you, just let us know.

06:38.709 --> 06:39.709
Well, if I don't make it,

06:39.792 --> 06:44.792
I want you to make sure
my sons get this note.

06:44.875 --> 06:47.000
-(both) Done.
-(cell phone ringing)

06:49.000 --> 06:50.709
(ringing)

06:50.792 --> 06:52.125
(squawks)

06:52.208 --> 06:54.750
(ringing)

06:54.834 --> 06:58.083
Oh! I can't believe
you fell for that.

06:58.166 --> 07:00.792
Why would that call have been for
you? It's my cell phone.

07:03.333 --> 07:05.417
-You got my "1" button?
-(squawks)

07:05.500 --> 07:08.834
Hey. Now I can't call
my buddies in Saigon.

07:09.500 --> 07:10.500
Touché?

07:11.500 --> 07:13.000
What else can you do?

07:17.709 --> 07:20.000
Hey, can I borrow 5 bucks?
I left my wallet at home.

07:20.083 --> 07:21.917
What do you need $5.00 for--

07:22.000 --> 07:24.500
Because Abraham Lincoln
is your latest president crush

07:24.583 --> 07:27.458
or because wool-worth's is having
a 48-hour girdle sale.

07:27.542 --> 07:30.667
There. I did it for you. You don't
talk with your mouth full.

07:30.750 --> 07:32.750
Here.
All I have are hundreds.

07:32.834 --> 07:34.834
Because I worked
the streets last night.

07:34.917 --> 07:36.917
Apparently
I'm a prostitute? Nice.

07:37.875 --> 07:39.250
Thank you.

07:43.166 --> 07:45.083
Nice job, buddy.
Let's go get you that hat.

07:45.166 --> 07:46.750
-(squawks)
-Mine.

07:46.834 --> 07:48.083
Where's my change?

07:48.166 --> 07:49.458
A bird took it.

07:50.125 --> 07:53.417
I want it back by tonight
or I'm gonna beat it out of you.

08:00.417 --> 08:01.917
Why are you sitting here,
newbie?

08:02.000 --> 08:05.625
I'd sit with my interns, but Keith's
over there, and I can't stand him.

08:05.709 --> 08:07.625
I've seen that kid.
Horrible doctor.

08:07.709 --> 08:12.041
I would sooner leave my medical care
in the hands of Dr. Acula.

08:12.125 --> 08:14.500
Yes, I read
your vampire screenplay,

08:14.583 --> 08:17.917
and as much as it pains me
to say it, I didn't hate it.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.667
Here's what you got to do
with this Keith.

08:19.750 --> 08:21.291
You turn the heat up on his ass.

08:21.375 --> 08:22.625
Sooner or later,
he'll make a mistake

08:22.709 --> 08:24.458
and then you bounce him
the hell out of here.

08:24.542 --> 08:27.291
What did you think of the
Transylvania dream sequence?

08:27.375 --> 08:28.917
Because I wrote it
while I was on call,

08:29.000 --> 08:30.208
and the next morning
I woke up and read it,

08:30.291 --> 08:32.333
and I was like,
"what was I thinking?"

08:32.417 --> 08:34.917
Bethany, focus.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.208
I can't just pick one
of them out to torture.

08:37.291 --> 08:40.125
Then dump on all of them.
I'm sure they deserve it.

08:40.208 --> 08:42.125
Let's face facts.
You are their teacher.

08:42.208 --> 08:43.709
How competent can they be?

08:44.333 --> 08:47.208
Actually, just this morning one
of them had trouble with an I.V.

08:47.291 --> 08:49.875
Yesterday one of them made
a diagnosis of a backwards x ray.

08:49.959 --> 08:52.208
And last week, one of them
made a patient septic

08:52.291 --> 08:54.417
when he confused a suppository
with a Mike and Ike.

08:54.500 --> 08:57.375
Stellar group there, newbie.
Let the torturing commence.

08:57.458 --> 09:00.375
-(beeping)
-Oh. I'm sorry.

09:00.458 --> 09:04.166
That means
conversational time is o-v-e-r.

09:04.250 --> 09:06.542
Please exit the area.
Please exit the area.

09:06.625 --> 09:07.792
When you get a chance,

09:07.875 --> 09:09.667
I'd love to talk to you more
about the screenplay.

09:09.750 --> 09:12.000
Please exit the area.
Please exit the area.

09:12.750 --> 09:14.792
(J.D.) <i>Turk and Elliot were</i>
<i>having a hard time too</i>

09:14.875 --> 09:17.792
<i>because their patient, Mr. Burton,</i>
<i>didn't make it through surgery.</i>

09:17.875 --> 09:20.083
We did everything
we could for your dad.

09:20.166 --> 09:22.917
We are so sorry,
Devin, Eric.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.291
That's Devin. I'm Eric.

09:25.375 --> 09:28.375
Oh. You guys must
get that all the time.

09:28.458 --> 09:31.125
Why? Because all black
people look the same?

09:31.208 --> 09:33.417
No. Because
you're identical twins.

09:33.500 --> 09:36.792
-Is she always this racist?
-Oh, there's a pattern.

09:37.500 --> 09:39.375
Identical twins, Turk.

09:43.834 --> 09:48.500
Keith. It looks like somebody's
gone prematurely gray.

09:49.208 --> 09:51.792
That's gonna hurt with the ladies.

09:51.875 --> 09:54.500
Wow.
You know, Dr. Cox told me

09:54.583 --> 09:55.875
you were getting tough
on your interns.

09:55.959 --> 09:59.542
I had no idea you were gonna go
all cotton ball on their asses.

09:59.625 --> 10:01.875
I think I know how to deal
with people, Carla.

10:01.959 --> 10:04.083
Check this.
Cabbage, heat test.

10:04.166 --> 10:06.792
(sizzling)

10:06.875 --> 10:08.500
It's a little hot.

10:08.583 --> 10:10.542
I'll add some milk.
Thank you.

10:11.333 --> 10:13.250
-See?
-Yeah.

10:13.333 --> 10:15.458
(J.D.)
<i>And now it's good-bye, Keith.</i>

10:15.542 --> 10:17.166
Interns, gather.

10:17.250 --> 10:22.667
The next person who screws up
is gonna be suspended for 2 weeks.

10:22.750 --> 10:24.792
This is a list
of all of your names.

10:24.875 --> 10:28.000
At least the ones I remember.
At the end of each day,

10:28.083 --> 10:31.917
I'll either write a smiley face
or a sad face next to your name.

10:32.000 --> 10:35.417
One sad face and you are Gonzo.
And I wanna warn you,

10:35.500 --> 10:38.375
I write my sad faces
pretty darn sad.

10:38.458 --> 10:40.959
Allow me to demonstrate.
Dr. Cox, may I borrow your pen?

10:41.041 --> 10:42.250
Not going to happen.

10:42.333 --> 10:44.792
I had to strangle a nurse
to get this clicky top.

10:45.417 --> 10:47.917
Please. I'm in the middle
of a very threatening speech.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.834
-Return this pen or die painfully.
-Thank you.

10:50.917 --> 10:54.166
So as I was saying,
my sad face--

10:54.250 --> 10:56.458
(J.D.) <i>Around here, it can be</i>
<i>tough to hang on to things.</i>

10:56.542 --> 10:58.583
<i>So if someone's trying to take</i>
<i>your new friend away,</i>

10:58.667 --> 10:59.834
<i>you might have to lie.</i>

10:59.917 --> 11:02.417
The bird's dead, sir.
And if you're wondering.

11:02.500 --> 11:04.375
Sanchez tasted like chicken.

11:04.458 --> 11:05.583
I ate him.

11:05.667 --> 11:06.750
I get it.

11:06.834 --> 11:09.291
Just sign this order form
so I can stop talking to you.

11:11.667 --> 11:13.709
(squawks)

11:13.792 --> 11:15.208
<i>-Gracias.</i>
<i>-De nada.</i>

11:17.375 --> 11:19.291
You said our father
left us a note?

11:19.375 --> 11:21.834
Yep. Dr. Turk, give it to them.

11:23.166 --> 11:25.125
Elliot, I gave it to you.
You have the note.

11:25.208 --> 11:26.750
You give it to them.

11:26.834 --> 11:28.625
(J.D.) <i>And if you feel your</i>
<i>credibility slipping away,</i>

11:28.709 --> 11:30.959
<i>you might have to excuse</i>
<i>yourself for a moment.</i>

11:31.041 --> 11:36.208
Excuse us for just one minute,
Deric, Devin, Eric. (clears throat)

11:39.166 --> 11:40.250
Anyway, I know it's in pencil,

11:40.333 --> 11:43.500
but that's what a sad 2-week
suspension face would look like.

11:43.583 --> 11:47.000
-All right? Very, very sad.
-Yes.

11:48.917 --> 11:51.333
Who tried to give Mrs. Meadows
an ace inhibitor?

11:52.583 --> 11:55.458
She's 6 months pregnant.
She could've lost the baby.

11:55.542 --> 11:57.667
(J.D.) <i>Of course, sometimes</i>
<i>there's nothing you can do.</i>

11:57.750 --> 11:59.959
That was me, sir. Sorry.

12:01.417 --> 12:03.792
Oh, cabbage.

12:03.875 --> 12:05.542
Not you, wolfman.

12:11.959 --> 12:13.125
I...

12:13.834 --> 12:16.917
I can't believe you're finally
getting out of this deathtrap.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.667
The odds were against you.

12:18.750 --> 12:21.542
You had
a life-threatening disease,

12:21.625 --> 12:23.333
a life-threatening doctor.

12:23.417 --> 12:24.792
Anyway...

12:26.500 --> 12:29.291
it was a pleasure
treating you, and--

12:29.375 --> 12:32.000
I know how hard it is
for you to say something nice.

12:32.083 --> 12:33.542
So you can go.

12:33.625 --> 12:35.083
Thanks.

12:36.291 --> 12:38.333
Why the grim face there,
Trish?

12:38.417 --> 12:41.041
Watching Kelso's
afternoon staring contest

12:41.125 --> 12:42.834
with the last brownie?

12:43.750 --> 12:47.083
You bested me again,
you little chocolate bitch.

12:48.458 --> 12:51.375
No. I'm just kind of sad
about my intern.

12:51.458 --> 12:52.834
Why? You got exactly
what you wanted.

12:52.917 --> 12:54.458
You drove Keith out of here.

12:54.542 --> 12:57.083
No, I drove cabbage out.
That's Keith.

12:57.166 --> 12:59.583
That's Keith? That kid's
the best intern we've got.

12:59.667 --> 13:02.667
Hell, I'd like to bronze him,
turn my office into a Keith-edral,

13:02.750 --> 13:04.125
and convert to Keith-tianity.

13:04.208 --> 13:06.667
And FYI, I still want my pen back.

13:06.750 --> 13:07.834
Oh, I don't have it.

13:07.917 --> 13:09.792
Then you damn sure
better find it, nubile 1.

13:09.875 --> 13:12.875
And when you do, I want it buffed,
shined, and identified.

13:20.792 --> 13:21.875
(whistles)

13:21.959 --> 13:25.083
You think that's funny?
This isn't over.

13:25.166 --> 13:26.917
What's not over?

13:27.000 --> 13:29.208
Deal with this, Turk.
I did not lose it. You did.

13:29.291 --> 13:30.875
I don't lose things.

13:30.959 --> 13:32.625
Please. You lose everything.

13:32.709 --> 13:35.041
Sometimes I worry what
you'd be like as a dad.

13:36.709 --> 13:38.625
Yeah, baby, we're on
our way back right now.

13:38.709 --> 13:40.875
Junior and I just went
to pick up a pumpkin.

13:43.291 --> 13:45.083
I'm gonna have
to call you back.

13:45.166 --> 13:49.083
Look. Somebody
left a baby here.

13:51.959 --> 13:54.083
Well, he is kind of cute.

13:54.166 --> 13:55.166
(exhales)

13:57.375 --> 14:00.250
-Our baby's first bath.
-Oh, watch the head.

14:06.709 --> 14:09.417
What? Come on!
That was intentional!

14:09.500 --> 14:11.917
Charge the mound, son!
Charge the mound!

14:12.000 --> 14:14.542
We are so damn proud
of you, son.

14:14.625 --> 14:18.417
My little valedictorian.

14:20.166 --> 14:22.458
Put him back together, baby.

14:24.125 --> 14:26.083
Mom?

14:26.166 --> 14:27.417
Dad?

14:27.500 --> 14:29.000
Son?

14:30.166 --> 14:32.458
-Son.
-Get over here, boy.

14:32.542 --> 14:35.083
You come here and
you give your father a hug.

14:35.583 --> 14:39.875
No!

14:39.959 --> 14:42.125
Dude, you all right?
You were gone for a really long time.

14:42.208 --> 14:44.250
You're gonna be an awful father.

14:44.333 --> 14:46.750
(J.D.)
<i>And now to take care of my boy.</i>

14:46.834 --> 14:48.458
Cabbage is back.

14:48.542 --> 14:50.959
Gang,
I should've made it clear earlier.

14:51.041 --> 14:54.125
The suspension policy
begins today at 4pm

14:54.208 --> 14:56.375
so my apologies to cabbage.

14:56.458 --> 14:59.375
-That's ok, Dr. D.
-You get in there.

14:59.458 --> 15:02.291
This is totally unfair.
If I'd messed up, I'd be gone.

15:02.375 --> 15:04.250
Let me explain something
to you, Keith.

15:04.333 --> 15:07.750
I treat each and every one of you
like unique individuals. Ok?

15:07.834 --> 15:09.333
Take Laurie for example.

15:09.417 --> 15:11.750
The woman's 400 years old.
She needs to sleep a lot.

15:11.834 --> 15:13.834
I work around that schedule.

15:13.917 --> 15:15.625
Wolfman's got
to be home by daybreak,

15:15.709 --> 15:18.083
so he does all his work
come nightfall.

15:18.166 --> 15:21.083
Crazy Barry.
Not allowed near children.

15:21.166 --> 15:22.750
We work around that.

15:23.500 --> 15:24.875
How come I don't
get a nickname?

15:24.959 --> 15:28.166
Not everyone's last name lends
itself to a nickname, Keith.

15:28.250 --> 15:29.959
My last name is Dudemeister.

15:30.041 --> 15:32.333
And what am I supposed
to do with that, ok?

15:32.417 --> 15:34.083
I'm not a magician.

15:36.875 --> 15:40.583
Patricia, it's been a real pleasure
having you here at Sacred Heart.

15:40.667 --> 15:43.625
And I certainly hope the next time
you fall ill, you'll remember us.

15:44.709 --> 15:48.166
I'm not implying
that you'll get ill.

15:48.250 --> 15:49.959
It's just that you're old,

15:50.041 --> 15:52.875
and chances are good,
stop talking, Robert.

15:54.458 --> 15:56.500
It's all right.
I know what you meant.

15:57.417 --> 15:58.917
(fluttering)

15:59.917 --> 16:03.667
Damn it, Sanchez. I told you
Dorian's in room 136. This is--

16:03.750 --> 16:05.417
(squawks)

16:05.500 --> 16:07.667
136. I was wrong.

16:07.750 --> 16:10.917
I apologize, Sanchez.
You were right, as always.

16:11.834 --> 16:12.792
What?

16:12.875 --> 16:14.750
Hey, newbie.

16:19.166 --> 16:21.291
Watch out for the bedpan.

16:22.375 --> 16:23.792
Now we're even.

16:23.875 --> 16:26.000
But answer me this one question,
will you, please?

16:26.667 --> 16:29.250
Those are beautiful antlers.

16:29.333 --> 16:32.583
No.
Why is that screw-up still here?

16:32.667 --> 16:36.875
You see, Dr. Cox, I treat each and
every one of my interns differently.

16:36.959 --> 16:38.458
Ya done.

16:38.542 --> 16:41.500
So you accidentally drummed
your friend out of here

16:41.583 --> 16:43.917
because you were trying
to 86 the Dudemeister.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.500
That nickname will never stick.
It's too long.

16:46.583 --> 16:49.375
Listen carefully, newbie.
Things happen for a reason.

16:50.083 --> 16:51.208
Do me a favor and think back

16:51.291 --> 16:53.125
on all those mistakes
that your interns made

16:53.208 --> 16:54.667
and tell me this.

16:54.750 --> 16:55.625
Who made them?

16:56.667 --> 17:00.083
Hey, Dr. D., is the I.V.
supposed to leak like this?

17:02.542 --> 17:05.000
I'm not quite sure
what I'm looking at here.

17:07.208 --> 17:08.250
Don't worry.

17:08.333 --> 17:11.208
You're gonna feel much better
once I insert this suppository.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.458
I don't remember
who made those mistakes.

17:16.542 --> 17:17.834
Yeah, you do.

17:21.166 --> 17:22.542
(J.D.) <i>Ok, this sucks.</i>

17:22.625 --> 17:25.709
<i>But at least I didn't forge a note</i>
<i>from a dead father.</i>

17:25.792 --> 17:27.166
You guys ready?

17:28.500 --> 17:30.834
All right, Elliot. Begin.

17:30.917 --> 17:32.959
"My dearest Eric,

17:33.041 --> 17:36.458
it is my wish for you that you
finally find a good woman..."

17:36.542 --> 17:37.542
I'm gay.

17:37.625 --> 17:40.500
"So that she might
find you a man..."

17:40.583 --> 17:41.834
Dad didn't know I was gay.

17:41.917 --> 17:44.333
"So that he might
find you a woman."

17:44.417 --> 17:47.458
I found your note
in Sanchez's wreath.

17:47.542 --> 17:49.333
I also found a bunch
of little furniture.

17:49.417 --> 17:51.625
I don't know where he got that.
Sure the hell didn't make it.

17:51.709 --> 17:53.083
Didn't have the time.

17:56.291 --> 17:58.583
"Make sure you clean out
the gutters at the lake house

17:58.667 --> 18:00.667
so the front porch
doesn't flood"?

18:01.917 --> 18:04.375
Ours was better than that.

18:09.250 --> 18:11.041
Well, it's done.

18:11.125 --> 18:12.583
I had him stuffed.

18:17.917 --> 18:19.208
Terrific.

18:20.792 --> 18:22.375
And he's gone.

18:22.458 --> 18:25.375
Wow. That was impressive,
my friend.

18:25.458 --> 18:26.875
You're free to fly.

18:31.875 --> 18:33.959
Farewell, Sanchez.

18:34.041 --> 18:37.000
(speaking Spanish)
You have my heart.

18:37.083 --> 18:39.417
You have my heart.

18:43.291 --> 18:45.458
(J.D.)
<i>Time to give Keith a little treat.</i>

18:45.542 --> 18:50.125
Hey, Todd, my buddy Keith here
says you're no good at rat tailing.

18:50.208 --> 18:51.583
Oh, really?

18:55.917 --> 18:58.792
There.
Tell him I'm good.

18:58.875 --> 19:01.834
Oh, he's good, Keith.
Really good.

19:01.917 --> 19:03.375
Thanks for the warning.

19:08.291 --> 19:09.500
Hey, Dr. Dorian.

19:09.583 --> 19:12.583
Hey, Jason.
We need to talk.

19:13.333 --> 19:16.750
Look, you're not progressing
as fast as the other interns,

19:16.834 --> 19:19.875
and you've been making
a lot of mistakes lately.

19:19.959 --> 19:21.750
I know what you're gonna say.

19:21.834 --> 19:24.000
I really am suspended for 2 weeks.

19:24.083 --> 19:26.583
But I promise I'll do much better
when I come back.

19:27.625 --> 19:30.291
Yeah, about coming back.

19:31.959 --> 19:33.917
(J.D.) <i>Dr. Cox was right.</i>

19:56.542 --> 19:57.875
Excuse me for a sec.
