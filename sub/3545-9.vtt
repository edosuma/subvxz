00:00.166 --> 00:02.375
<i>Previously on </i>Desperate Housewives...

00:03.750 --> 00:05.709
<i>One was careless...</i>

00:05.792 --> 00:09.333
You put a woman into a coma.
Surely, that arouses some emotion.

00:09.417 --> 00:11.834
- Well, it doesn't.
- You and I are finished.

00:11.917 --> 00:14.083
<i>One said goodbye.</i>

00:14.166 --> 00:16.166
I'm tired of feeling like a failure.

00:16.291 --> 00:17.625
<i>One almost lost it.</i>

00:17.709 --> 00:20.417
Your wife didn't kill herself
because of my note,

00:20.500 --> 00:22.959
but because of what she did
to that poor baby.

00:23.041 --> 00:26.667
<i>And one got exactly</i>
<i>what she deserved.</i>

00:31.917 --> 00:35.417
<i>Gabrielle was waiting</i>
<i>for her next great idea.</i>

00:35.500 --> 00:38.709
<i>Her first great idea</i>
<i>came when she was 15,</i>

00:38.792 --> 00:42.250
<i>after her stepfather</i>
<i>paid her a late-night visit.</i>

00:42.333 --> 00:46.500
<i>She bought a bus ticket to New York</i>
<i>the very next day.</i>

00:46.583 --> 00:48.792
<i>Her next occurred five years later</i>

00:48.875 --> 00:53.083
<i>when she decided to seduce</i>
<i>a famous fashion photographer.</i>

00:53.166 --> 00:57.917
<i>One week later she began her career</i>
<i>as a runway model,</i>

00:58.000 --> 01:01.750
<i>which soon led</i>
<i>to her next great idea,</i>

01:01.834 --> 01:05.417
<i>her decision to marry Carlos Solis.</i>

01:05.542 --> 01:10.834
<i>Before she knew it, she had jumped off</i>
<i>the runway and moved to the suburbs.</i>

01:10.917 --> 01:16.333
<i>Her most recent great idea was born</i>
<i>out of her boredom with her new life.</i>

01:16.458 --> 01:20.959
<i>That's how she came to start an affair</i>
<i>with her teenage gardener,</i>

01:21.041 --> 01:25.000
<i>which was cut short</i>
<i>by a tragic accident.</i>

01:25.125 --> 01:29.959
<i>So, once again, Gabrielle</i>
<i>was in need of a great idea.</i>

01:30.041 --> 01:33.041
I know you're worried,
but it's gonna take time.

01:34.208 --> 01:35.667
What is?

01:35.750 --> 01:40.166
You look sad. I assumed you were
thinking about your mother-in-law.

01:40.250 --> 01:43.917
- No.
- So what were you thinking about?

01:45.208 --> 01:50.125
My life. It hasn't turned out
like I thought it would.

01:50.250 --> 01:54.083
- Honey.
- Oh, no. I know I shouldn't complain.

01:54.166 --> 01:58.000
It's just there's something missing
and I don't know what it is.

01:58.083 --> 02:00.834
- Do you ever feel that way?
- No.

02:00.959 --> 02:03.834
When I go home at night,
I sleep like a baby.

02:03.917 --> 02:06.834
I know I did something
that day that helped people.

02:06.917 --> 02:09.583
- That must be a nice feeling.
- It is.

02:09.667 --> 02:12.500
There's times I wish
I didn't have to work so hard.

02:12.583 --> 02:15.417
We got a nursing shortage
and they cut our budget.

02:15.500 --> 02:20.291
<i>Attention, all available personnel.</i>
<i>Code blue, stat, room 214.</i>

02:20.375 --> 02:23.208
- Excuse me.
<i>- All available personnel.</i>

02:23.291 --> 02:25.625
<i>Code blue, stat.</i>

02:28.083 --> 02:30.625
Get a doctor in here.
I don't have an airway.

02:30.750 --> 02:34.917
No time. I have to intubate.
Mr. Getz, listen.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.542
You're not dying on me, OK?
This tube is to help you breathe.

02:38.625 --> 02:40.709
I need you to be brave now.

02:40.834 --> 02:45.125
<i>It was then that Gabrielle</i>
<i>got her next great idea.</i>

02:47.208 --> 02:51.917
<i>She decided to throw the first Annual</i>
<i>Sacred Heart Charity Fashion Show</i>

02:52.000 --> 02:54.417
<i>to raise money for more nursing staff.</i>

02:54.500 --> 02:58.583
Gaby, I can't do it. I cannot walk down
a runway in one of these dresses.

02:58.709 --> 03:03.041
They all make me look so fat.
Please get someone to take my place.

03:03.125 --> 03:06.417
Listen, Betty! OK?
You're not quitting on me now.

03:06.500 --> 03:10.750
We'll find you a gown that's black
and slimming and you'll look great.

03:10.834 --> 03:14.041
- I need you to be brave now.
- OK.

03:14.166 --> 03:19.959
<i>And that night when she went to bed,</i>
<i>Gabrielle slept like a baby.</i>

04:03.041 --> 04:07.917
<i>News of the fashion show</i>
<i>spread quickly on Wisteria Lane.</i>

04:08.000 --> 04:11.542
<i>Though the event was for charity,</i>
<i>Gabrielle soon discovered</i>

04:11.667 --> 04:14.583
<i>when it came to the latest fashions,</i>

04:14.667 --> 04:18.166
<i>women are seldom charitable.</i>

04:18.250 --> 04:21.709
<i>No one knew this better</i>
<i>than Edie Britt.</i>

04:24.709 --> 04:30.208
<i>She understood that treachery</i>
<i>never goes out of style.</i>

04:32.417 --> 04:36.041
- Susan.
- Give me the dress.

04:37.542 --> 04:40.041
I gave it a shot.

04:42.083 --> 04:44.125
Hi, Helen. How's the dress fitting?

04:44.208 --> 04:47.625
Great. Maybe it could be taken out
in the shoulder a little.

04:47.750 --> 04:49.834
Sure. No problem.

04:51.291 --> 04:53.333
There you go.

04:53.458 --> 04:56.166
Gabrielle,
I never thanked you properly.

04:56.250 --> 04:58.542
- For what?
- For what you did for my son.

04:58.625 --> 05:02.667
It was so nice of you to hire John
as your gardener.

05:02.750 --> 05:05.625
Believe me, it's been my pleasure.

05:05.709 --> 05:07.750
- How's he doing?
- Good.

05:07.875 --> 05:10.917
I hear he's dating
Danielle Van De Kamp.

05:11.041 --> 05:14.834
For now. It's just a matter of time
before they break up for good.

05:14.917 --> 05:16.417
What's wrong?

05:16.500 --> 05:20.166
She just seems to want much more
of a relationship than he does.

05:20.291 --> 05:23.500
You remember what it was like
dating teenage boys.

05:23.583 --> 05:25.667
- Vaguely.
- Thank you.

05:25.750 --> 05:28.208
Tell Tanaka that if he doesn't call me

05:28.291 --> 05:32.792
I'm gonna go down to his office,
find him and kick his ass!

05:35.375 --> 05:37.250
Ladies.

05:40.166 --> 05:42.250
- Trouble at work?
- I don't know.

05:42.333 --> 05:46.542
He's making money left and right.
I just wish he'd relax.

05:46.625 --> 05:52.458
Crap! I'm telling you,
all of the good dresses are taken.

05:52.583 --> 05:54.875
Now, what the hell
am I supposed to wear?

05:54.959 --> 05:58.834
Well, Mrs. Huber never showed up.
Why don't you wear this one?

06:01.458 --> 06:06.709
This is an old-lady dress.
You won't even be able to see my body.

06:06.792 --> 06:09.333
Edie, you're always thinking of others.

06:09.417 --> 06:11.583
So why isn't Mrs. Huber here?

06:11.667 --> 06:14.583
Last I heard,
she went to visit her sister.

06:14.667 --> 06:17.834
I just can't believe that Martha
would agree to wear this.

06:17.959 --> 06:21.333
She always says she'd never
be caught dead in black.

06:22.583 --> 06:27.709
<i>Sadly for Mrs. Huber,</i>
<i>this was no longer the case.</i>

07:00.208 --> 07:03.542
- Hey, Mom.
- Julie, you got a letter from Zach.

07:03.625 --> 07:06.667
- Isn't that weird, him writing you?
- Yeah.

07:06.750 --> 07:10.667
Well, open. Open, open. He could
have said something about Dana.

07:10.750 --> 07:14.625
- I'll read it later.
- Later? What's wrong with now?

07:14.709 --> 07:17.041
I've got tons of homework, Mom.

07:17.125 --> 07:20.125
Julie, what's going on?

07:20.208 --> 07:22.792
This isn't the first letter from Zach.

07:22.875 --> 07:26.709
We've been writing each other
the last couple of weeks.

07:26.792 --> 07:30.917
- Are you mad?
- No. Just when I was your age,

07:31.000 --> 07:34.583
my pen pal lived on a farm in Ohio,
not in a mental institution.

07:34.667 --> 07:37.333
That letter is one notch
above prison mail.

07:37.417 --> 07:40.083
Zach's not crazy.
He's just upset over his Mom,

07:40.208 --> 07:43.083
and his Dad doesn't
even seem to care.

07:43.166 --> 07:46.834
He just needs a friend.

07:49.417 --> 07:54.375
I've packed the diapers, I'm getting
the juice boxes and carrot sticks...

07:54.458 --> 07:56.875
- Sunscreen?
- Got it.

07:56.959 --> 07:59.208
I go pick up the boys, we hit the park,

07:59.291 --> 08:03.750
and that should give you
a good couple of hours.

08:04.917 --> 08:07.208
Enjoy the vacation.

08:10.417 --> 08:12.125
What?

08:12.208 --> 08:17.000
While you're gone, I'll be paying bills
and sorting laundry and cooking dinner.

08:17.083 --> 08:20.750
So what part of that
sounds like a vacation?

08:20.834 --> 08:23.291
OK, right. We'll pick up dinner.

08:23.458 --> 08:27.250
You just take a hot bath,
relax, recharge.

08:30.834 --> 08:35.125
OK, I get it. It's gonna take
more than a hot bath to recharge.

08:35.208 --> 08:37.375
But don't forget, I'm here all week.

08:37.458 --> 08:39.125
Then what?

08:41.959 --> 08:44.458
And then we go back to normal?

08:44.583 --> 08:50.625
Tom, our last version of normal had me
popping pills. Normal is a bad plan.

08:50.750 --> 08:54.125
We'll put our heads together
and come up with a solution.

08:54.208 --> 08:57.875
I think we need to hire
a nanny full time.

08:57.959 --> 09:02.917
- God, it's just such a big commitment.
- I know, and we can't afford it.

09:03.000 --> 09:06.792
And I know everything
that's happened is my fault,

09:06.875 --> 09:09.208
but if I don't get some help,

09:09.291 --> 09:13.375
there's an excellent chance
I will lose my mind.

09:15.542 --> 09:18.083
OK. Well, then,
we have to make it work.

09:20.834 --> 09:22.083
No, no, no.

09:22.166 --> 09:24.917
<i>Next up: 200-meter freestyle.</i>

09:28.125 --> 09:30.208
- It's just not right.
- What?

09:30.291 --> 09:34.959
A woman is in a coma because of Andrew,
and there he is, happy as a clam.

09:35.041 --> 09:39.667
We grounded him, took away his TV.
How else you wanna punish him?

09:39.750 --> 09:43.875
<i>Swimmers, take your marks.</i>

09:48.041 --> 09:50.792
I think we should make him
quit the swim team.

09:51.792 --> 09:55.625
Bree, this is the one thing in his life
that he's passionate about.

09:55.709 --> 09:59.375
Maybe if we take it away from him,
he'll understand what he did.

09:59.458 --> 10:02.166
He has not shown an ounce of remorse.

10:02.250 --> 10:05.709
Of course he feels bad.
He's just keeping up a facade.

10:05.792 --> 10:08.208
Well, he's doing a fabulous job.

10:08.291 --> 10:11.917
If we take him off the team,
he'll lose his shot at a scholarship

10:12.000 --> 10:14.083
and he's never gonna forgive us.

10:14.208 --> 10:18.625
If he grows up with some humanity,
that's a risk I am willing to take.

10:18.709 --> 10:22.000
- Well, I'm not.
- You don't love him as much as I do.

10:22.083 --> 10:25.041
- Isn't that nice?
- It's a fact. I'm his mother.

10:25.125 --> 10:27.166
He lived inside of me.

10:27.250 --> 10:29.875
He hung out in your womb
back in the '80s.

10:29.959 --> 10:32.500
I have grown to love him
as much as you.

10:36.917 --> 10:40.875
- What just happened?
- That kid you both love won the race.

10:57.250 --> 10:59.750
That's what she tells me, anyway.

11:04.083 --> 11:05.875
John.

11:05.959 --> 11:10.417
My mom said you needed volunteers,
so I volunteered.

11:12.458 --> 11:15.959
- Finally got the charity bug?
- You sound surprised.

11:16.041 --> 11:19.834
No, not really.
You were always a giver.

11:19.917 --> 11:23.917
Would you knock it off?
My mom's right over there.

11:25.834 --> 11:28.166
Have a seat.

11:28.291 --> 11:32.458
You can start by helping us
alphabetize the donation cards.

11:38.792 --> 11:41.375
So, word is
you and Danielle might break up.

11:41.458 --> 11:43.542
Maybe. I don't know.

11:43.625 --> 11:47.959
- Is that because of me?
- Not everything is about you.

12:01.500 --> 12:05.458
- Would you stop that?
- Have you been thinking about me?

12:05.542 --> 12:08.333
- No.
- Really?

12:09.667 --> 12:12.375
Could have fooled me.

12:15.542 --> 12:19.083
- Hey. Do you need any help?
- Please. Just pull up a chair.

12:19.166 --> 12:21.250
- Gosh.
- That's OK. I got it.

12:44.709 --> 12:47.500
Susan, hi. Wanna help
with the seating cards?

12:47.583 --> 12:52.959
Wanna tell me why you had your foot
in John Rowland's crotch yesterday?

12:53.041 --> 12:57.208
Oh, that. He was helping me
adjust the seam in my stocking,

12:57.291 --> 13:01.500
and from your angle
it must have looked a little weird.

13:01.583 --> 13:04.959
You're sleeping with him, aren't you?

13:05.041 --> 13:08.709
OK, yes, but you have to promise
not to tell anybody.

13:08.792 --> 13:13.125
Gabrielle, he's in high school,
and it's illegal and you're married.

13:13.250 --> 13:15.458
If Carlos found out,
this would kill him.

13:15.542 --> 13:17.875
It's just sex. It's totally harmless.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.917
How can you call
something like this harmless

13:21.000 --> 13:24.667
after everything you know
about I went through with Karl?

13:24.750 --> 13:27.041
- This isn't about you.
- Yes, it is.

13:27.125 --> 13:31.250
Me and every other person who was
screwed over by somebody they loved.

13:31.375 --> 13:34.917
When Karl ran off with Brandi
you saw what a basket case I was.

13:35.041 --> 13:38.125
I was tearing up his clothes.
I couldn't get out of bed.

13:38.208 --> 13:40.625
You were there.
How could you do the same?

13:40.750 --> 13:43.417
How can you compare me to Karl?
That's not fair.

13:43.542 --> 13:46.500
- You have no idea about my life.
- Enlighten me.

13:46.583 --> 13:50.375
You're beautiful, you have money
and a husband who adores you.

13:50.500 --> 13:53.250
No, he doesn't adore me.
He adores having me.

13:53.333 --> 13:56.417
That's a rationalization
and you know it.

13:58.792 --> 14:00.875
I'll see you at the show.

14:03.834 --> 14:06.208
OK, honey, in you go. Hey, there.

14:06.291 --> 14:08.875
- How many nannies did you interview?
- Ten.

14:08.959 --> 14:11.458
Each one more incompetent
than the last.

14:11.542 --> 14:16.625
One asked me... there you go... if she
was expected to change diapers.

14:16.709 --> 14:18.750
Good nannies are so hard to find.

14:18.834 --> 14:21.542
I hoped to take advantage
of your expertise.

14:21.625 --> 14:24.208
Lord. What do you want me to do?

14:24.291 --> 14:27.417
All your rich friends have nannies,
A-list nannies.

14:27.500 --> 14:30.834
I need to catch one
without their bosses.

14:30.917 --> 14:33.875
- Why?
- So I can poach me one.

14:33.959 --> 14:35.000
Lynette!

14:35.083 --> 14:37.542
At my old job
we didn't wait for good people.

14:37.667 --> 14:41.667
We raided other companies.
It's no different with hiring a nanny.

14:41.750 --> 14:46.375
Good help is hard to find, but stealing
a family's nanny is so unseemly.

14:46.458 --> 14:51.417
If I make a better offer, why shouldn't
a qualified person reap the benefits?

14:53.250 --> 14:57.792
So, come on, where can I score
some high-grade nanny?

15:01.834 --> 15:05.208
Hey, Mrs. Solis.
I have some awesome news.

15:05.291 --> 15:08.000
I have some not-so-awesome news.
You go first.

15:08.083 --> 15:11.291
I broke it off with Danielle.
I passed her a note in class.

15:11.375 --> 15:14.208
So we can be together.

15:14.333 --> 15:17.709
- John, your timing is impeccable.
- What do you mean?

15:17.834 --> 15:23.834
Susan Mayer saw us last night,
and she knows everything.

15:40.500 --> 15:43.542
<i>Since the accident,</i>
<i>Bree had started to worry</i>

15:43.625 --> 15:47.417
<i>her son's sense of morality</i>
<i>was going up in smoke.</i>

15:50.709 --> 15:53.917
<i>She was right to be concerned.</i>

15:55.208 --> 15:58.041
Andrew? Can I come in?

15:59.208 --> 16:00.417
Yeah. Just a sec.

16:02.583 --> 16:06.291
Hey, what's up?

16:06.375 --> 16:10.917
- Why are you smiling?
- It's just a joke that I heard.

16:11.041 --> 16:14.583
- What was it about?
- Well, it's kinda dirty, Mom.

16:14.667 --> 16:18.917
Charming. I was wondering
if you've bothered to spend any time

16:19.000 --> 16:21.667
reflecting on why
you've been grounded

16:21.750 --> 16:24.375
and the pain
you've caused the Solis family.

16:24.458 --> 16:30.250
Yeah. I totally get how my actions
have affected, like, everything else.

16:30.333 --> 16:32.583
Really?

16:34.250 --> 16:39.458
I mean, you know, like,
when I do something like I did,

16:39.583 --> 16:42.291
then you gotta do
something like you did,

16:42.375 --> 16:44.750
which is, you know, it's cool,

16:44.834 --> 16:49.458
because then everything
just kind of balances itself out

16:49.583 --> 16:53.750
and goes all smooth again.

16:53.834 --> 16:56.375
- You know?
- No, I don't.

16:58.917 --> 17:02.291
What's that smell?

17:05.166 --> 17:07.959
Have you been smoking marijuana?

17:08.083 --> 17:11.291
- No, of course not.
- You are strung out!

17:11.375 --> 17:15.959
- No! No, Mom.
- Excuse me.

17:24.834 --> 17:27.875
- What's that?
- The container you'll urinate into.

17:27.959 --> 17:30.500
- Come on.
- That hurts!

17:50.709 --> 17:53.000
Doctor Sicher.
What are you doing here?

17:53.083 --> 17:57.250
Mr. Young, I didn't want to upset you
by telling you over the phone.

17:57.333 --> 18:00.667
- What is it?
- Zach is missing from Silvercrest.

18:00.750 --> 18:05.417
It happened yesterday evening,
we think during the shift change.

18:05.500 --> 18:08.792
I know this is difficult to hear.
I'm sorry.

18:08.875 --> 18:13.166
Yeah, well, it's just been
one of those days.

18:14.458 --> 18:18.291
I still don't get why
you're not with Danielle any more.

18:19.750 --> 18:24.166
- She looked so slutty at Ray's party.
- She's not my type, I guess.

18:24.250 --> 18:27.458
You still hung up
on your mysterious married lady?

18:27.542 --> 18:30.959
What is it with her,
besides the obvious, of course?

18:31.041 --> 18:35.166
We talk about real stuff. She doesn't
treat me like some lame yard boy.

18:35.250 --> 18:38.375
But you are a lame yard boy.

18:38.500 --> 18:42.291
It's all messed up now anyway.
Her friend found out about us.

18:42.375 --> 18:46.000
If it gets out,
her husband's gonna kill me.

18:46.083 --> 18:49.667
On the upside, your social status
at school is going to explode

18:49.750 --> 18:52.083
now you're doing a hot housewife.

18:52.166 --> 18:54.250
Shut up, dude.

18:58.208 --> 19:00.375
Explain how he could just walk out.

19:00.458 --> 19:03.166
With the money I pay,
you can afford a padlock.

19:03.250 --> 19:06.667
With all due respect,
we are not a high-security facility,

19:06.750 --> 19:09.250
and you restrict our ability
to treat Zach.

19:09.333 --> 19:10.750
What?

19:10.875 --> 19:15.500
You insist we medicate him without
psychotherapy, a recipe for disaster.

19:18.750 --> 19:21.250
Zach is a troubled young man,

19:21.375 --> 19:23.875
and he's getting progressively worse.

19:31.625 --> 19:33.667
Hungry?

19:35.125 --> 19:37.250
I'm starving.

19:45.959 --> 19:49.709
<i>Bree had given Lynette the low-down</i>
<i>on Valley View Park.</i>

19:49.792 --> 19:54.125
<i>It was a gathering place for upscale</i>
<i>nannies and their young charges.</i>

19:54.792 --> 19:56.959
<i>It was Lynette's first time there,</i>

19:57.083 --> 20:00.083
<i>and she was determined</i>
<i>not to go home alone.</i>

20:01.208 --> 20:03.959
<i>Of course,</i>
<i>Lynette had high standards,</i>

20:05.250 --> 20:08.000
<i>so making a connection...</i>

20:09.333 --> 20:11.417
<i>...wasn't easy.</i>

20:11.500 --> 20:16.458
<i>Still, she was desperate</i>
<i>to find that special someone.</i>

20:18.583 --> 20:22.041
<i>And that's exactly who she found.</i>

20:22.125 --> 20:24.583
OK. All righty.

20:24.667 --> 20:29.125
Here's one for you, and one for Amy.

20:30.291 --> 20:34.291
All right, have fun, and I'll be
right here if you need me, OK?

20:36.834 --> 20:39.250
<i>From the moment she saw her...</i>

20:39.333 --> 20:41.375
- Is this seat taken?
- No, go ahead.

20:41.500 --> 20:44.583
<i>...Lynette knew she had to have her.</i>

20:44.667 --> 20:47.583
You are wonderful with those children.

20:47.667 --> 20:49.542
Thanks.

20:51.208 --> 20:53.625
- I'm Lynette.
- Claire.

20:53.750 --> 20:56.250
Claire? I always loved that name.

20:57.542 --> 21:00.458
So, Claire...

21:00.542 --> 21:02.959
Do you come here often?

21:23.542 --> 21:26.333
- What's this?
- Your son's urine.

21:28.083 --> 21:30.166
I'm gonna need a moment.

21:30.250 --> 21:33.166
I think Andrew
has been smoking marijuana.

21:33.250 --> 21:36.083
- Get it tested right away.
- Why?

21:36.166 --> 21:39.417
I want to pull him from
the swim team. They'll want proof.

21:39.500 --> 21:42.625
- You're not taking him off the team.
- Yes, I am.

21:42.709 --> 21:46.250
If you try, I'm gonna go to the coach
and tell him to ignore you.

21:46.333 --> 21:50.333
We're not gonna screw up Andrew's
future because he sparked a doobie.

21:50.417 --> 21:54.208
- I mean, come on, we've all done it.
- Not all of us.

21:54.291 --> 21:57.667
Rex, I thought you moved back
to straighten Andrew out,

21:57.750 --> 22:00.750
to teach him the consequences
of his actions.

22:00.834 --> 22:04.250
- Why are you fighting me on this?
- Because I disagree.

22:04.333 --> 22:08.959
We're still getting divorced and I
won't let you push me around any more.

22:09.041 --> 22:13.667
I never pushed you around.
We always made our decisions together.

22:13.750 --> 22:17.667
No, you always make decisions
then tell me I agree.

22:17.750 --> 22:21.959
18 years of smiling and taking it.
What a liar I was.

22:22.041 --> 22:25.792
- Thank God you're out of my life.
- Rex...

22:28.125 --> 22:29.792
What are you doing?

22:29.875 --> 22:33.834
Same thing you just did
to every memory I have of our marriage.

22:35.166 --> 22:39.750
You know what? If you were my mom,
I'd smoke pot too!

22:42.667 --> 22:45.667
So your boss made you
return her underwear?

22:45.750 --> 22:50.208
- After she had already worn them once.
- Couldn't you have just said no?

22:50.291 --> 22:53.792
You don't say no to Alexis...
if you want to keep your job.

22:53.875 --> 22:57.166
- She sounds awful.
- What can I do? I love the kids.

22:59.709 --> 23:03.333
If we had a nanny like you,
we would treat her like gold.

23:06.000 --> 23:10.709
Did I mention
I have four very lovable kids?

23:10.792 --> 23:13.333
- Really?
- Yes.

23:13.417 --> 23:15.291
- Claire!
- Oh, no.

23:15.375 --> 23:17.333
- What?
- It's Alexis.

23:17.458 --> 23:20.500
- You should go.
- Are you gonna be here tomorrow?

23:20.583 --> 23:22.750
- I wanna see you again.
- No, I'm busy.

23:22.834 --> 23:25.834
- I just want to talk.
- Lynette, this isn't right.

23:25.959 --> 23:29.000
Claire, please.

23:33.250 --> 23:36.959
All right. I will be at this address
until noon tomorrow. Now go.

23:37.041 --> 23:38.542
OK.

23:43.542 --> 23:45.667
Hi. Where are the kids?

23:55.166 --> 23:59.000
- What are you doing here?
- I know you know.

23:59.083 --> 24:03.208
And you're probably freaking out,
so I just wanted to explain.

24:04.000 --> 24:08.333
What me and Mrs. Solis have,
it's deep, you know?

24:08.417 --> 24:12.041
We've got a future. It's not just sex.

24:12.125 --> 24:15.875
Listen to me. There is no future
for you and Gabrielle.

24:15.959 --> 24:18.667
She's not gonna divorce Carlos
and run away.

24:18.750 --> 24:22.750
- Why not?
- Because he has money, a lot of it.

24:22.875 --> 24:26.583
I'm not gonna be mowing lawns for ever.
I have big plans.

24:26.667 --> 24:30.000
Just stop talking.
John, how old are you?

24:30.083 --> 24:32.291
- Almost 18.
- Exactly.

24:32.375 --> 24:35.959
You are not mature enough
to have a realistic perspective.

24:36.083 --> 24:38.875
You would be much happier
with a girl your own age.

24:38.959 --> 24:41.625
She's the one I want.

24:42.667 --> 24:45.375
You know, I really love her.

24:56.709 --> 24:59.709
Please welcome Mrs. Arlene Nord.

24:59.792 --> 25:03.375
We have Arlene and Norris to thank
for all our folding chairs.

25:03.458 --> 25:07.500
So, please remember, for all
your folding chair needs, rent Nords.

25:09.458 --> 25:14.041
Next up, we have Mrs. Betty Nolan!

25:17.625 --> 25:21.083
- Thank God Tom could fill in.
- Why did Carlos back out?

25:21.166 --> 25:24.000
Some work emergency.
He wouldn't talk about it.

25:24.125 --> 25:28.208
- Sometimes I could just kill him.
- Tom's having the time of his life.

25:28.291 --> 25:30.417
Hands off, fellas. She's all mine.

25:31.959 --> 25:35.709
I guess he does sort of have
a dorky charm.

25:35.792 --> 25:38.875
OK, Bree, you're up first,
followed by Lynette,

25:38.959 --> 25:41.166
and then Edie. Edie?

25:41.250 --> 25:45.000
- Where's Edie Britt?
- Over here.

25:46.500 --> 25:48.709
Edie, what did you do to that dress?

25:48.792 --> 25:51.041
Well, I made it audience friendly.

25:51.125 --> 25:53.417
Can you tell I'm not wearing underwear?

25:53.500 --> 25:55.583
- Yes.
- Good.

25:59.625 --> 26:01.709
Sorry I'm late.

26:03.458 --> 26:08.125
You should never take this dress off
for your entire life.

26:08.208 --> 26:12.583
- Really? I look OK?
- Oh, Susan, you look so gorgeous.

26:12.667 --> 26:16.959
- Doesn't she, Edie?
- It's a bit much.

26:17.041 --> 26:19.750
Change the line-up.
Susan has to go last.

26:19.834 --> 26:23.291
- Nothing is gonna top this.
- Isn't Helen going last?

26:23.375 --> 26:25.709
She never showed up.

26:25.834 --> 26:28.917
I think that's a great idea.
OK, let's go.

26:35.041 --> 26:38.625
You really do look fantastic.

26:42.417 --> 26:45.834
Next up, we have
Mrs. Bree Van De Kamp

26:45.917 --> 26:52.125
in a pink party dress with laser cut,
full skirt and silk belt.

26:52.208 --> 26:55.000
Here is another exquisite
ball gown by Halston,

26:55.083 --> 26:58.333
modeled by the devastatingly
sexy Lynette Scavo.

26:58.417 --> 27:01.333
Notice the fine detail,
the clean lines.

27:02.542 --> 27:05.417
The dress is nice, too.

27:05.500 --> 27:08.542
Next up, please welcome Edie...

27:12.083 --> 27:13.709
...Britt.

27:16.125 --> 27:19.166
Tell Gabrielle I'm sorry
I backed out of the show.

27:19.250 --> 27:22.417
I'm just not
in a very festive mood right now.

27:24.458 --> 27:26.583
Helen! Helen, you're here.

27:26.667 --> 27:30.083
Did they tell you about the change?
I'm gonna go last.

27:30.208 --> 27:34.208
There's a special place in hell
for people like you.

27:34.291 --> 27:37.041
I'm sorry. It wasn't my decision.

27:38.583 --> 27:41.291
You're an adult.
Take some responsibility!

27:41.375 --> 27:44.083
What is wrong with you?

27:45.000 --> 27:47.458
She is wearing a dignified classic,

27:47.542 --> 27:51.500
perfect for a Sunday tea
or christening.

27:57.500 --> 28:01.291
For God's sake, Helen,
this is for charity!

28:01.375 --> 28:03.625
Edie Britt, everyone!

28:06.959 --> 28:11.417
- Keep your hands off my son!
- What?

28:11.542 --> 28:15.333
- Finally, to cap off our evening...
- Come on, you're up.

28:15.417 --> 28:21.125
...please welcome
the radiant Susan Mayer.

28:28.667 --> 28:31.667
Tom, say something!

28:31.750 --> 28:34.208
A vision in white silk...

28:34.291 --> 28:38.000
chiffon with gold,
hand-beaded French lace

28:38.083 --> 28:42.208
and lavender marabou.

28:43.917 --> 28:46.917
Susan Mayer!

28:49.750 --> 28:51.834
She's never looked better.

28:57.333 --> 29:00.417
Susan, I feel awful
about what happened.

29:02.333 --> 29:04.834
Susan, talk to me.

29:05.709 --> 29:09.417
OK, you're gonna find Helen Rowland
and tell her the truth

29:09.500 --> 29:12.917
before everyone thinks
I'm sleeping with an underage boy.

29:13.041 --> 29:15.125
- I can't do that.
- Why not?

29:15.208 --> 29:20.375
- Carlos will divorce me.
- So? You obviously don't love him.

29:20.458 --> 29:25.667
I do love him. I do.
It's just complicated.

29:25.750 --> 29:29.917
You know, there's gotta be
another way to fix this.

29:30.041 --> 29:32.875
God, you are so weak.

29:33.000 --> 29:35.041
Susan, don't be like this.

29:35.125 --> 29:38.542
What did you expect? A hug?

29:48.041 --> 29:51.041
Alexis is still here.

29:51.125 --> 29:54.709
She was supposed to go to Pilates
but she got her period. Go.

29:54.792 --> 29:57.417
- Give me a second.
- No. She saw you at the park.

29:57.542 --> 30:00.667
She knows what you're doing.
You're not the first...

30:00.750 --> 30:01.750
Claire!

30:01.834 --> 30:03.917
How can you stay here?

30:04.041 --> 30:07.166
She can be tough,
but it comes with the territory.

30:07.250 --> 30:12.041
- I would never treat you that way.
- What did you do with the aspirin?

30:12.125 --> 30:15.917
I will give you 20 per cent more
than she's paying, plus overtime.

30:16.041 --> 30:18.750
Dammit, Claire!
Where the hell are you?

30:21.000 --> 30:25.417
I don't take orders from your friends
and I don't do laundry.

30:25.500 --> 30:27.667
- Dishes?
- Only the kids'.

30:27.750 --> 30:30.291
How fast can you pack?

30:36.000 --> 30:38.417
I got a nanny!

30:40.500 --> 30:44.291
- Where are you gonna go?
- I don't know. But I can't go home.

30:44.375 --> 30:48.709
- Are you afraid of your dad?
- No. It's not him. It's me.

30:48.792 --> 30:52.166
My life is really messed up. It's bad.

30:52.291 --> 30:56.291
- What's bad? You can tell me.
- No, I can't!

30:57.500 --> 31:00.250
It's better that you don't know.

31:08.166 --> 31:10.625
I already know a little.

31:33.291 --> 31:36.333
- Hi, Danielle. How was school?
- It was OK.

31:36.417 --> 31:40.000
Good. Where does Andrew
keep his marijuana?

32:03.667 --> 32:09.041
<i>Bree had resorted to extreme measures</i>
<i>to save her son's soul.</i>

32:09.125 --> 32:14.625
<i>As she rummaged through</i>
<i>Andrew's private possessions,</i>

32:14.709 --> 32:19.792
<i>it occurred to her</i>
<i>that sometimes a little betrayal...</i>

32:19.875 --> 32:22.375
<i>...is good for the soul.</i>

32:33.417 --> 32:35.875
I was really young, like four.

32:35.959 --> 32:38.750
I heard my mom and my dad yelling.

32:38.834 --> 32:43.000
I heard 'em yell my name and hers.

32:43.083 --> 32:44.750
Dana?

32:47.250 --> 32:52.875
So I went down to the room
and I saw them cleaning it up.

32:52.959 --> 32:55.709
Cleaning what up?

32:57.583 --> 32:59.667
Blood.

33:01.959 --> 33:04.083
Was it Dana's?

33:05.500 --> 33:07.583
I think so.

33:09.083 --> 33:12.291
I couldn't remember this
for the longest time,

33:12.417 --> 33:15.750
and then my mom killed herself

33:15.834 --> 33:18.625
and I started having these dreams.

33:20.208 --> 33:24.834
I don't even see Dana.
I just... I see the blood

33:24.959 --> 33:27.500
and my mom picking me up

33:27.583 --> 33:31.208
and putting me on my bed
and whispering that it's not my fault.

33:32.959 --> 33:37.709
And after that, every time
I'd say her name, they'd get upset.

33:37.792 --> 33:40.750
So I wasn't even allowed
to say it any more.

33:40.834 --> 33:45.583
I'm not sure I understand
what you're saying.

33:45.667 --> 33:48.792
I killed my baby sister.

33:50.458 --> 33:52.709
Zach, oh, my God.

33:52.792 --> 33:56.667
And they buried her to protect me.

34:29.834 --> 34:33.000
- Helen, do you have a minute?
- Gabrielle.

34:33.125 --> 34:36.875
I didn't tell you how sorry I was
about what happened.

34:36.959 --> 34:40.709
- I didn't intend to cause a scene.
- People didn't even notice.

34:40.792 --> 34:44.625
This is a little awkward.
I know you're friends with Susan Mayer.

34:44.709 --> 34:47.375
But let's just say I had my reasons.

34:47.458 --> 34:50.125
It wasn't Susan.

34:51.166 --> 34:53.291
It was me.

34:53.417 --> 34:55.291
What?

34:55.375 --> 34:58.709
I'm the one
who was sleeping with your son.

35:02.125 --> 35:04.625
I'm so sorry.

35:05.542 --> 35:07.959
For how long?

35:08.041 --> 35:11.375
Almost a year. But it's over now.

35:13.208 --> 35:15.291
So when it started,

35:15.375 --> 35:18.208
he was 16?

35:19.667 --> 35:22.542
I think.

35:25.083 --> 35:28.041
But, Helen, you have to believe me,
it's over now.

35:28.125 --> 35:32.000
No, you're wrong.
It's not even close to being over.

35:39.792 --> 35:42.750
- Dude, coach wants to see you.
- Really?

35:42.834 --> 35:45.750
Hey, I bet it's about my scholarship.

36:01.959 --> 36:03.417
Hello?

36:03.542 --> 36:06.000
Yes, this is she.

36:06.125 --> 36:09.959
Marijuana in his locker?
I'm just horrified.

36:10.125 --> 36:13.375
There must be
some sort of terrible mistake.

36:13.458 --> 36:17.166
Yeah, OK.
Well, I will be right down.

36:28.375 --> 36:33.458
<i>Elsewhere, another darker secret</i>
<i>was the object of an investigation.</i>

36:33.542 --> 36:36.542
Mr. Linder?

36:37.875 --> 36:39.333
Detective Beckerman.

36:39.458 --> 36:43.625
This is Detective Burnett. We were
hoping for a minute of your time.

36:47.208 --> 36:51.333
If you know anything about Zach's
whereabouts, you need to tell me now.

36:51.458 --> 36:53.709
Honey, what's going on?

36:53.792 --> 36:58.291
Zach's gone from Silvercrest. They
found letters in his room from Julie.

36:58.375 --> 37:02.000
- They were writing to each other.
- I need to see those letters.

37:02.083 --> 37:05.083
Mom, they're private.

37:05.166 --> 37:08.917
My son is missing.

37:09.000 --> 37:13.417
Julie, in the letters, did Zach say
anything about running away?

37:13.500 --> 37:15.917
No.

37:16.000 --> 37:18.250
- There's your answer.
- Susan...

37:18.333 --> 37:21.709
If we hear anything,
I will let you know right away.

37:21.834 --> 37:25.166
I understand how worried you must be.

37:25.250 --> 37:30.041
- Obviously you don't.
- Paul, my daughter doesn't lie.

37:39.834 --> 37:41.875
This was a very popular design.

37:42.041 --> 37:46.166
I must have sold several hundred
of these just like it, ten years back.

37:46.250 --> 37:50.959
- Do you keep any documentation?
- I have a list of customers' names.

37:51.041 --> 37:54.667
- Somewhere. It's been a while.
- We'll need a copy of that list.

37:54.750 --> 37:58.792
Sure. Wow, this chest
looks like it's been through hell.

37:58.875 --> 38:03.959
We pulled it out of Rockwater Lake,
you could say by way of hell.

38:04.041 --> 38:06.792
Was there anything in the chest?

38:06.875 --> 38:10.625
It had a body inside. Adult female.

38:11.875 --> 38:15.792
Yeah, but how do you fit a body
into a chest that size?

38:17.333 --> 38:19.834
It was chopped up.

38:47.166 --> 38:51.834
Of all the stupid, boneheaded
decisions. What were you thinking?

38:51.917 --> 38:54.834
I was set up. The coach
got an anonymous phone call.

38:54.959 --> 38:57.625
Andrew, what does it matter?
The pot was there.

38:57.750 --> 39:02.417
- I was holding it for a friend.
- You know...

39:02.500 --> 39:05.583
I can't decide
which is more humiliating,

39:05.667 --> 39:08.792
the fact that my son got caught
with pot in his locker

39:08.875 --> 39:13.959
or that he can't even come up
with a decent enough lie to explain it.

39:33.333 --> 39:35.667
<i>Gabrielle believed there was a chance</i>

39:35.750 --> 39:41.000
<i>Helen Rowland would inform Carlos</i>
<i>of his wife's extramarital activities.</i>

39:42.917 --> 39:46.166
<i>Gabrielle knew she had to come clean.</i>

39:47.041 --> 39:48.333
- Carlos?
- Yeah?

39:48.458 --> 39:50.500
<i>But coming clean...</i>

39:56.000 --> 39:58.750
<i>...was not one of</i>
<i>Gabrielle's specialties.</i>

39:58.834 --> 40:02.333
- I'm going to bed.
- Thanks for the newsflash.

40:18.959 --> 40:21.333
She turned me in!

40:24.208 --> 40:26.542
Carlos. Carlos, I'm so sorry.

40:26.667 --> 40:28.875
- I am so sorry.
- Sorry for what?

40:29.000 --> 40:31.583
Whatever happens,
I love you very, very much.

40:31.709 --> 40:35.709
- FBI. Open the door.
- Oh, my God.

40:35.792 --> 40:38.041
FBI. If you do not open the door,

40:38.166 --> 40:42.000
I am authorized to enter
the premises by use of force.

40:46.166 --> 40:48.834
Carlos Solis, I have a warrant
for your arrest.

40:48.917 --> 40:51.417
You have the right to remain silent.

40:51.500 --> 40:54.166
Anything you say
can be used against you.

40:54.250 --> 40:58.041
- Call our lawyer.
- Carlos, what's happening?

40:58.166 --> 41:02.792
If you cannot afford a lawyer,
one will be appointed for you.

41:09.333 --> 41:11.750
Carlos, wait!

41:11.834 --> 41:15.917
Gabrielle, this will all be
taken care of, I promise.

41:16.041 --> 41:20.625
I'm innocent, I swear to God.
It was Tanaka. He set me up.

41:31.709 --> 41:35.959
<i>People are complicated creatures,</i>

41:36.083 --> 41:42.375
<i>on the one hand able to perform</i>
<i>great acts of charity,</i>

41:42.458 --> 41:48.709
<i>on the other capable of the most</i>
<i>underhanded forms of betrayal.</i>

41:51.542 --> 41:55.375
<i>It's a constant battle</i>
<i>that rages within all of us,</i>

41:55.458 --> 41:59.458
<i>between the better angels</i>
<i>of our nature</i>

41:59.583 --> 42:03.125
<i>and the temptation</i>
<i>of our inner demons.</i>

42:06.917 --> 42:11.208
<i>And sometimes the only way</i>
<i>to ward off the darkness...</i>

42:15.166 --> 42:18.542
<i>...is to shine the light of compassion.</i>

42:27.417 --> 42:30.458
They took him away in handcuffs.
