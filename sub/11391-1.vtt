01:16.800 --> 01:19.189
Howdy!

01:22.040 --> 01:25.874
Scruffy lot of buggers, aren't they?
I bet they've just come off the boat.

01:32.440 --> 01:34.431
- It makes you wonder.
- What?

01:34.560 --> 01:36.915
What women see in 'em.

02:42.480 --> 02:44.436
Yanks!

02:57.680 --> 03:00.353
Yoo-hoo!

04:12.960 --> 04:15.269
Jean! Jean! Come quick!

04:15.400 --> 04:18.676
There's Yanks. Hundreds of 'em.

04:24.440 --> 04:26.715
As if we hadn't enough of them already.

04:26.840 --> 04:30.799
- Aye. Mother won't be pleased.
- But you will, eh?

04:30.920 --> 04:33.275
Aye. I like Yanks.

04:40.880 --> 04:43.075
Hey, sugar, you wanna hitch?

04:45.320 --> 04:49.438
- Why don't you come in here with us?
- There's more room in a tin of sardines.

04:49.560 --> 04:52.950
Yeah, ma'am, but not as much action!

05:02.040 --> 05:04.156
Pretty country.

05:05.400 --> 05:09.712
Look at all that green, Danny.
Winter and it's still green.

05:11.600 --> 05:15.309
You think they've got any more
like that little bus conductress?

05:15.440 --> 05:17.396
Don't you think about anything else?

05:17.520 --> 05:20.876
Three weeks on a boat pulling my pud
and scratching louse bites.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.436
You're diseased, Danny.
Brains all between your legs.

05:28.240 --> 05:31.949
Tea break. That's all I ever hear
around this goddamn place.

05:32.080 --> 05:34.548
That's right, Sergeant. Fancy a cup?

05:34.680 --> 05:36.989
I got 210 men due here any minute now.

05:37.120 --> 05:41.398
They're gonna want water. They won't
get any unless you fix the fucking pipe.

05:41.520 --> 05:45.035
- It's fixed.
- Why ain't it coming out the other end?

05:45.160 --> 05:47.469
It's waiting. Till it's turned on.

05:47.600 --> 05:51.479
- This is good.
- Would it be possible to get it turned on?

05:51.600 --> 05:55.434
- Yes. After I've had my tea.
- Fucking limeys.

05:55.560 --> 05:58.711
Why don't you have a cup, Yank?
Calm you down a bit.

05:58.840 --> 06:03.834
Don't call me Yank. I'm not a damn
Yankee. I'm from Ardmore, Oklahoma.

06:20.920 --> 06:22.876
Howdy!

06:25.760 --> 06:28.115
Give me some of that soap.

06:42.440 --> 06:44.396
Hey, honey!

06:44.520 --> 06:45.555
Oh, my God.

06:45.680 --> 06:48.558
- Over here! Over here!
- Hey, will you look at that?

06:48.680 --> 06:50.636
Dames! I'm feeling warmer already!

06:50.760 --> 06:53.194
The Red Cross only do it for officers.

06:53.320 --> 06:56.949
So don't put your uniform on.
They'll never tell the difference.

06:57.080 --> 06:59.992
- Hey!
- Over here!

07:00.120 --> 07:03.874
- Welcome to England.
- Thank you, ma'am.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.309
- Welcome to England.
- Hi, GI.

07:06.440 --> 07:08.396
- Where are you from?
- Connecticut.

07:08.520 --> 07:10.272
- Welcome to England.
- Thanks.

07:10.400 --> 07:12.994
Keep your eye on the doughnut,
not on the hole.

07:13.120 --> 07:15.236
Thanks, lady.

07:15.360 --> 07:17.112
Boston, Mass.

07:17.240 --> 07:20.312
- Welcome to England.
- Hi, GI.

07:20.440 --> 07:23.113
- Where are you from?
- Louisville, Kentucky.

07:23.240 --> 07:24.798
Honey, it stinks.

07:24.920 --> 07:27.718
- Have a nice hot cuppa.
- Thank you, ma'am.

07:27.840 --> 07:29.990
- What's the matter?
- I think I'm in love.

07:30.120 --> 07:32.998
I think you've been too
long on the boat.

07:33.120 --> 07:35.793
- Welcome to England.
- Get outta here.

07:35.920 --> 07:39.549
- Where are you from?
- Arizona.

07:39.680 --> 07:43.150
- Name?
- Private Jacques.

07:43.280 --> 07:45.510
- Name?
- Ruffelo.

07:45.640 --> 07:47.631
.I hear you're quite a boxer?

07:47.760 --> 07:51.594
- Golden gloves. - Keep your hands
to yourself round here.

07:51.720 --> 07:53.278
- Name?
- Dyson.

07:53.400 --> 07:57.552
It's a beautiful country. A little
chilly. They forgot to put the roof on.

07:57.680 --> 08:01.639
- What are the women like?
- I haven't met one yet.

08:01.760 --> 08:04.832
- When do we get a pass, sir?
- What's a pass?

08:04.960 --> 08:06.916
Thank you, ma'am.

08:07.040 --> 08:10.794
- Welcome to England.
- Psst.

08:10.920 --> 08:13.115
I got the truck for the orchestra
on Saturday.

08:13.240 --> 08:16.471
- Oh. Wonderful. Thank you.
- Can I have one with sugar?

08:16.600 --> 08:18.795
Fantastic. Thanks a lot.

08:18.920 --> 08:21.309
- And where do you come from?
- Burlington, lowa.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.959
 Stretch out. Make sure
those waistline muscles are pulling.

08:32.080 --> 08:34.594
- Morning, Dad.
- Morning, love.

08:34.720 --> 08:36.870
Morning, Clarrie.

08:37.000 --> 08:40.993
- Won't be a minute with your overalls.
- That's all right, love.

08:41.120 --> 08:45.716
I like 'em warm, anyway. It's bloody
freezing this morning on the bike.

08:45.840 --> 08:49.116
- What shift you on?
- Nine till seven.

08:49.240 --> 08:52.391
Not again.
You'll kill yourself, that's what you'll do.

08:52.520 --> 08:54.829
Doing two jobs, it's just ridiculous.

08:54.960 --> 08:57.110
It's the same for everybody, isn't it?

08:57.240 --> 09:01.756
- Geoffrey, come and get your breakfast.
- Coming.

09:03.320 --> 09:05.436
- You do look worn out.
- I am, love.

09:05.560 --> 09:07.312
Mind the plate. It's hot.

09:07.440 --> 09:10.352
- Geoffrey!
- Coming, Mother.

09:10.480 --> 09:13.677
- Morning.
- Morning, lad.

09:13.800 --> 09:15.756
- Morning, Geoff.
- Morning.

09:15.880 --> 09:19.873
- Where did you get that hat from?
- Billy Rathbone gave it to me.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.594
- Where did he get it from?
- The fish-and-chip run.

09:22.720 --> 09:24.711
- The what?
- The chip run.

09:24.840 --> 09:27.513
Kids fetch fish and chips
for the Yanks at the camp.

09:27.640 --> 09:30.473
- Billy's the big organiser.
- They pay us.

09:30.600 --> 09:33.876
- He's letting me help him on Saturday.
- You'll do no such thing.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.514
- Mother.
- Take that silly cap off at the table.

09:36.640 --> 09:38.596
- Mother!
- Take it off, Geoffrey.

09:38.720 --> 09:41.109
- They're very good to the kids.
- Are they?

09:41.240 --> 09:44.232
You like your brother
behaving like some little scrounger?

09:44.360 --> 09:46.635
- Really!
- Perhaps it's how you see yourself.

09:46.760 --> 09:49.320
Amusement to foreigners
with more money than sense.

09:49.440 --> 09:51.954
- Honestly!
- Your Ken might have something to say.

09:52.080 --> 09:54.389
- Dad.
- They're only lads, Mother.

09:54.520 --> 09:56.670
Soldiers thousands of miles from home.

09:56.800 --> 09:59.997
- We should be grateful.
- Oh, but I am grateful.

10:00.120 --> 10:02.076
We need all the help we can get.

10:02.200 --> 10:06.352
But do they have to act
as though they own the place?

10:08.280 --> 10:11.477
Go on. Move it out of the way.

10:11.600 --> 10:14.114
All the way.

10:17.040 --> 10:18.996
Fucking limey rain.

10:20.880 --> 10:24.270
- Driver, right on back to receiving.
- OK, Sergeant.

10:24.400 --> 10:26.755
What we gonna do with all this shit?

10:26.880 --> 10:30.236
5650-0086-35.

10:30.360 --> 10:32.794
No way. I'm not signing for
something I didn't get.

10:32.920 --> 10:36.037
Look on the manifest.
You got ten crates of binoculars.

10:36.160 --> 10:39.550
- This is a binocular? Come on!
- OK, so they fucked up a little.

10:39.680 --> 10:42.194
It's the army. What do you expect?

10:42.320 --> 10:46.233
I got a little Scotch in the truck. You
keep the sneakers, you get two cases.

10:46.360 --> 10:49.875
- You trying to bribe a fellow officer?
- I gotta get outta here.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.956
- I'm shocked at you.
- Four cases.

10:52.080 --> 10:54.230
- Six.
- That's robbery.

10:54.360 --> 10:56.635
I don't want the Scotch for myself.

10:56.760 --> 11:01.231
Look at these poor, wet, miserable
bastards. Outside working their asses off.

11:01.360 --> 11:04.909
These are my men. I couldn't face
myself if I didn't look after them.

11:05.040 --> 11:07.918
You're as full of shit
as a Christmas turkey.

11:08.040 --> 11:12.795
- You're the one with his nuts in a wringer.
- OK, six cases.

11:15.280 --> 11:17.510
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

11:17.640 --> 11:18.595
Schmuck.

11:18.720 --> 11:21.518
 Convoy six,
attention in the mess hall.

11:21.640 --> 11:23.949
Some of you guys haven't stored...

11:24.080 --> 11:27.709
- More onions and potatoes in there.
- Right.

11:28.760 --> 11:31.433
Some of those leftover bones.
Give it some flavour.

11:31.560 --> 11:35.109
- Sure thing, Matt.
- Cigarette out.

11:35.240 --> 11:38.789
I'll take some of those grits.
What about some of those ham hocks?

11:39.960 --> 11:43.316
A little bit of greens. Some gravy.

11:45.880 --> 11:49.714
- I'll be back for the watermelon later.
- You do that. Next.

11:53.520 --> 11:57.593
Hold on to it. Hold on to it. Hold on!
Let go! Let go!

12:00.400 --> 12:03.233
- We got it!
- Don't lose it, whatever it is.

12:03.360 --> 12:06.477
- A pass, dummy. We got a pass!
- No shit!

12:06.600 --> 12:09.512
I hear some of these giris
ain't seen men for years.

12:09.640 --> 12:13.030
Can you imagine? Years.
Hurry up! Get changed!

12:13.160 --> 12:16.869
They've waited years, Danny. I think
they can wait a couple more hours.

12:18.040 --> 12:21.350
Any more fares, please?
Any more fares?

12:22.400 --> 12:24.356
Any more?

12:28.160 --> 12:30.469
Any more fares, please?

12:32.880 --> 12:36.839
Coach and Horses next stop.
Coach and Horses.

12:37.920 --> 12:39.876
Coach and Horses.

12:40.000 --> 12:43.959
Coach and Horses, Dad.
Come on, now. Any more fares?

12:44.080 --> 12:46.958
Who hasn't paid me? Come on, now.

12:47.080 --> 12:49.230
Night, Dad. Be careful.

12:51.240 --> 12:53.913
- There you go, sir.
- Thank you, Sergeant.

12:54.040 --> 12:56.713
- Is he gonna be OK?
- Who, the sergeant major?

12:56.840 --> 12:59.479
He'd find the Coach and Horses
with his head in a bucket.

12:59.600 --> 13:01.909
Could an' all, that one.

13:02.960 --> 13:04.712
- What did she say?
- I don't know.

13:04.840 --> 13:09.516
How far you going, lads? No cracks from
you, cheeky face. I've heard it all before.

13:09.640 --> 13:13.030
Town, is it? First time?

13:13.160 --> 13:15.151
Cat caught his tongue?

13:15.280 --> 13:18.192
Shy. Very shy boy. Scared of women.

13:18.320 --> 13:21.198
- Oh. Two fours, please.
- I'll get it.

13:21.320 --> 13:23.880
- You OK?
- Yeah.

13:24.000 --> 13:28.278
One sixpence, two pennies. Ta, love.

13:28.400 --> 13:30.516
Any more fares, please?

13:30.640 --> 13:33.200
D'you hear that? She called me love.

13:34.680 --> 13:37.558
I don't think it's personal.

13:37.680 --> 13:40.592
Last stop now. Come on. Everybody off.

13:40.720 --> 13:43.280
This is it. Little America.

13:45.440 --> 13:49.228
Town terminus.
Come on, lads. All out. This is it.

13:49.360 --> 13:51.316
As far as we go.

13:52.440 --> 13:55.989
- I heard there was fog. This
is ridiculous. - Night, love.

13:56.120 --> 13:58.873
- Is this town?
- Just a couple of minutes' walk, love.

13:59.000 --> 14:02.515
- Follow that road there.
- OK. Thank you.

14:05.760 --> 14:07.910
Hey, cherub.

14:09.480 --> 14:12.472
- Me?
- Come here.

14:17.120 --> 14:19.076
Here.

14:19.200 --> 14:21.873
Just in case you get lost.

14:24.400 --> 14:26.152
What's it say?

14:29.200 --> 14:31.953
It says we're going to the movies.

14:33.520 --> 14:36.114
All right!

14:36.240 --> 14:39.596
# Run, rabbit, run, rabbit,
run, run, run

14:39.840 --> 14:43.594
# Run, rabbit, run, rabbit,
run, run, run

14:43.720 --> 14:47.838
# Don't give the farmer his
fun, fun, fun

14:47.960 --> 14:51.919
# He'll get by without his rabbit pie

14:52.040 --> 14:56.591
# So run, rabbit, run, rabbit,
run, run, run

14:56.720 --> 15:02.317
- If they come, I'm not speaking to them.
- Don't. I'm not bothered.

15:02.440 --> 15:06.877
- Do you want half? Last one.
- If you're offering.

15:07.000 --> 15:10.834
# I've got tuppence to spend
and tuppence to lend

15:10.960 --> 15:15.636
# And tuppence to send home to my wife

15:17.680 --> 15:20.797
My mother'll kill me.
If only you'd asked me first.

15:20.920 --> 15:22.956
How could I? They were on my bus.

15:33.040 --> 15:37.909
- Hey, there they are.
- # The sage in bloom is like perfume

15:38.040 --> 15:41.635
# Deep in the heart of Texas

15:41.760 --> 15:44.035
Excuse me.

15:44.160 --> 15:46.116
Come on, come on.

15:57.640 --> 16:00.677
This is Movietone.
Leslie Mitchell reporting.

16:04.240 --> 16:07.198
The latest films to arrive
from the Burma front show...

16:07.320 --> 16:10.710
Sorry we're late, but it was
so goddamn dark we couldn't find it.

16:10.840 --> 16:14.594
It's a blackout, chuck. Show 'em a
light and they drop a bomb on you.

16:14.720 --> 16:17.439
- They're like that, the Jerries. Nasty.
- Shh!

16:17.560 --> 16:19.790
- The name's Danny.
- Mollie.

16:19.920 --> 16:21.478
- This is Matt.
- Hi.

16:21.600 --> 16:23.909
- This is Jean.
- Glad to know you, Jean.

16:24.040 --> 16:27.510
- Shh!
- I said glad to know you, Jean.

16:27.640 --> 16:30.313
Do you mind?
I'm trying to watch the news.

16:30.440 --> 16:33.193
The object of this attack
was to obtain identification

16:33.320 --> 16:35.754
of Japanese troops
reported to be in occupation.

16:37.040 --> 16:38.393
- Cigarette?
- No.

16:38.520 --> 16:40.351
Oh, ta.

16:42.800 --> 16:45.234
- Did you see that?
- Shut up!

16:47.120 --> 16:50.430
Matt, you gotta be quiet.
She's trying to watch the news.

16:52.400 --> 16:54.470
Fish and chips four times, is it?

16:54.600 --> 16:56.636
- Eating them now?
- I'm starving!

16:56.760 --> 16:58.830
Help yourself to salt and vinegar.

16:58.960 --> 17:01.428
Here you are, Jean.
There's nothing on 'em.

17:01.560 --> 17:05.155
- Cod and chips twice.
- More batter here, Doris.

17:08.800 --> 17:10.836
Get out of it! You can talk!

17:10.960 --> 17:13.838
There, soldier. Get that down you
and you'll not do so bad.

17:13.960 --> 17:15.915
- You ain't kidding.
- Half a crown, love.

17:16.040 --> 17:17.791
Oh, sure. Uh...

17:19.520 --> 17:22.955
No, two shillings and sixpence.
Take him on one side and teach him.

17:23.079 --> 17:26.390
He'd best learn t'money or they'll
do him right, left and centre.

17:26.520 --> 17:30.308
- Now, son, what's yours?
- Fish and chips, please. 36 times.

17:30.440 --> 17:35.673
- We'll be here all night!

17:37.320 --> 17:40.039
- You don't look like a boxer to me.
- What do you mean?

17:40.160 --> 17:42.469
You know what they call me?
Boom-boom Ruffelo.

17:42.600 --> 17:46.832
- Boom-boom!
- Really. Cos I got power in both hands.

17:46.960 --> 17:51.636
- I got power somewhere else too.
- Bragging again, are we?

17:51.760 --> 17:53.830
We're not having a very good time,
are we?

17:53.960 --> 17:55.996
No, I'm fine, really.

17:58.600 --> 18:01.034
- You been out with an American?
- No.

18:01.160 --> 18:03.515
Maybe that's what's bothering you.

18:03.640 --> 18:06.234
- A girl gets a name going with
Americans. - I ain't...

18:06.360 --> 18:08.555
And my family has a shop here.

18:08.680 --> 18:11.274
- See you tomorrow, Jean.
- Mollie, wait a minute.

18:11.400 --> 18:13.755
- Matt, see you at the barracks.
- I must go.

18:13.880 --> 18:16.838
- Behave yourself!
- What are you so scared about?

18:16.960 --> 18:19.793
- You don't have to be scared of me.
- I'm not scared.

18:19.920 --> 18:23.230
Cos I tell you,
I'm the one that ought to be scared.

18:23.360 --> 18:25.112
Think about it.

18:25.240 --> 18:29.358
Here I am, God knows where,
God knows how long.

18:30.480 --> 18:33.950
I'm out with the first
real English girl I ever met.

18:35.040 --> 18:37.190
That's pretty scary.

18:38.240 --> 18:40.834
I told you, it isn't you.

18:41.880 --> 18:43.632
- Somebody else?
- Hm.

18:43.760 --> 18:46.638
- Right. He's in the army?
- Yes.

18:46.760 --> 18:50.196
We're getting engaged
when he gets leave.

18:51.240 --> 18:54.118
But you're not engaged yet,
so you can see me again.

18:54.240 --> 18:56.834
I don't understand.
I've told you there's no point.

18:56.960 --> 18:59.155
I'd just like to see you again.

18:59.280 --> 19:05.310
Like tonight. We could go take in a
movie, something to eat, go for a walk.

19:05.440 --> 19:07.556
No fancy moves.

19:07.680 --> 19:10.069
You just want a girl.

19:10.200 --> 19:13.272
- The woods are full of giris.
- Pick yourself one.

19:13.400 --> 19:18.030
Look, you never ever met
anyone like me before.

19:18.160 --> 19:23.871
- No one as modest, anyway. - I didn't
mean it like that, like bragging.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.514
It's like I never met
anyone like you before.

19:28.720 --> 19:31.757
Oh. I'm not that special.

19:31.880 --> 19:34.997
Sure you're special.
I think everybody's special.

19:35.560 --> 19:39.394
- First of all, you're a foreigner.
- Oh, I see.

19:39.520 --> 19:43.957
Are we in America now? You shouldn't
have any trouble finding your way home.

19:44.080 --> 19:46.799
- I didn't mean it. I'm sorry.
- Good night.

19:46.920 --> 19:48.876
Wait. Where are you going?

19:49.000 --> 19:52.197
- It's all right. My mistake.
- You got me all wrong.

19:52.320 --> 19:56.154
- Sorry.
- I take it all back. I'm the foreigner.

19:57.480 --> 20:02.600
- I don't know how to get back. - Keep
going till you get to the monument.

20:02.720 --> 20:05.678
Thanks a lot. Where's the monument?

20:11.760 --> 20:13.876
- Shit!

20:18.080 --> 20:20.548
Where did you get it, Annie?

20:20.680 --> 20:22.716
Our last kid brought it home with him.

20:22.840 --> 20:25.434
- The one that was wounded?
- Aye, in Africa.

20:25.560 --> 20:29.917
Said he'd have brought the bloody head
as well if they'd let him.

20:30.040 --> 20:33.476
- Here's your stamps, Mrs Shenton.
- Could have been worse, Clarrie.

20:33.600 --> 20:36.797
- Could have been a Yank's.
- Ooh, I wish it had been.

20:36.920 --> 20:41.516
With a Yank in it and all.
They're my sort of lads, the Yanks.

20:43.320 --> 20:45.276
Hi.

20:48.600 --> 20:51.433
- Can I help you?
- That's very kind of you, ma'am.

20:51.560 --> 20:55.758
- Is it OK if I just look around?
- Yes, of course.

20:57.240 --> 20:59.390
- Ta-ra.
- Goodbye, Mrs Shenton.

20:59.520 --> 21:02.671
- See you.
- Bye.

21:02.800 --> 21:04.358
Goodbye.

21:06.280 --> 21:08.271
Sure there's nothing
I can help you with?

21:08.400 --> 21:12.951
Yeah. Do you carry -
what do you call them - bicycle clips?

21:13.080 --> 21:15.719
- We do.
- Could I try them on?

21:15.840 --> 21:19.071
Certainly. Jean,
would you take care of Annie, please?

21:19.200 --> 21:21.156
Yes, Mother.

21:29.080 --> 21:34.518
- Hey! Those are clothing coupons, love.
- Oh, sorry. Sorry.

21:34.640 --> 21:37.598
- Shall I put yours on account, Annie?
- Yes, please, love.

21:37.720 --> 21:39.790
It's pensión day on Thursday.

21:39.920 --> 21:45.677
I'll have to get myself one of these
lads. Pay you cash then, no danger.

21:47.880 --> 21:50.474
I can't seem to find them anywhere.

21:50.600 --> 21:52.670
You're not climbing ladders, Mother.

21:52.800 --> 21:56.315
- Go and see to my dad's tea.
- Thank you, Jean.

21:56.440 --> 22:00.479
- I'll be in the kitchen if you need me.
- All right.

22:07.480 --> 22:09.232
One pair of bicycle clips.

22:09.360 --> 22:11.920
- I wanna take you to the movies.
- No, thank you.

22:12.040 --> 22:14.554
I've already told you
I've got a boyfriend.

22:14.680 --> 22:17.717
Perhaps you don't believe me.
You'd like to see a photograph.

22:17.840 --> 22:20.308
Yeah, that'd be nice.
Maybe I should ask your mom.

22:20.440 --> 22:22.396
- Don't you dare!
- She'd show me.

22:22.520 --> 22:25.353
- Matt!
- Oh, remembered my name.

22:25.480 --> 22:28.074
Now, please, be sensible.

22:29.560 --> 22:33.599
- OK, let's both be sensible.
- Right.

22:33.720 --> 22:38.111
- How much do I owe you?
- One shilling, please.

22:38.240 --> 22:40.470
- There you go.
- Thank you.

22:41.960 --> 22:46.272
- Saturday, the Ritz, eight o'clock.
- No, thanks.

22:46.840 --> 22:49.718
- All right, I'm going.
- You are?

22:50.200 --> 22:52.760
I look like the kind of guy
to cause trouble?

22:53.640 --> 22:56.598
.It's OK. I'll just be back tomorrow.

23:13.400 --> 23:16.949
- Good morning, lvy.
- She's round the back.

23:29.880 --> 23:32.235
.You're not much help
.standing there staring.

23:32.360 --> 23:35.591
.I'm not staring, I'm admiring.

23:35.720 --> 23:38.917
- You're early, aren't you?
- I'm always early.

23:39.040 --> 23:40.996
.You just never noticed.

23:41.120 --> 23:43.236
.Here, let me give you a hand.

23:43.360 --> 23:47.638
- You'll get dirt on your uniform.
- I'm used to dirt.

23:48.360 --> 23:51.750
.I worked my way through law school
.collecting garbage.

23:51.880 --> 23:57.193
- I thought you washed dishes.
- I did that too. I did lots of things.

23:57.320 --> 24:03.236
- Dug ditches, shovelled coal, drove a taxi.
- Phone, Miss Helen! Master Tim.

24:03.360 --> 24:07.956
- Can you bring those leeks?
- Sure. That's what I'm here for.

24:08.080 --> 24:10.036
.Tim? This is getting ridiculous.

24:10.160 --> 24:13.118
.Nothing but phone, phone, phone.
.Why aren't you at school?

24:13.240 --> 24:15.196
.I am at school. They're playing rugger.

24:15.320 --> 24:19.472
- Shouldn't you be playing too?
- Yes, but... I try.

24:19.600 --> 24:21.909
.I'm just no good at it.

24:22.040 --> 24:25.077
- They all bully me.
- I see.

24:25.200 --> 24:27.270
.I try my best, Mum.

24:28.920 --> 24:31.434
- What do you say, giris?
- Hi.

24:31.560 --> 24:34.711
- Fresh new crop of Gls just came in.
- Hey!

24:34.840 --> 24:36.990
.Hey-hey! Huh?

24:37.120 --> 24:40.669
.Just kids, most of them.
.Ivy, listen. This is for you too.

24:40.800 --> 24:44.031
.Don't break their hearts.
.I gotta turn them into a fighting machine.

24:44.160 --> 24:47.550
- Before you start, would you like tea?
- No, thanks.

24:47.680 --> 24:51.753
.I'm floating in the stuff. I'm gonna go
.into the living room. The drawing room.

24:53.200 --> 24:58.797
. It's terrible for all of us. How do
.you think Daddy feels about being away?

24:58.920 --> 25:01.115
.Hm. That's better.

25:01.240 --> 25:04.596
- How are you, Mrs Moreton?
- Can't complain, Captain.

25:04.720 --> 25:06.278
.Good.

25:06.400 --> 25:11.155
.Yes, I will write tonight. Right. Chin up.

25:11.280 --> 25:15.068
- I'll see you in two weeks.
- Yes, all right. See you then.

25:15.200 --> 25:17.589
- Yes, bye.
- Bye, darling.

25:57.320 --> 26:01.029
- I can't play when anybody's watching.
- I like watching you play.

26:01.160 --> 26:05.438
.So angry with yourself when you make
.a mistake, as if you weren't allowed.

26:05.560 --> 26:09.633
- It tells me something about you.
- That I can't play the piano, yeah?

26:09.760 --> 26:13.435
- Are you cold?
- Well, it ain't Miami.

26:16.920 --> 26:19.912
.You don't have to drink it.

26:20.040 --> 26:23.555
- What was all that about?
- I said no to a cup of tea.

26:23.680 --> 26:25.636
.Sacrilege.

26:29.320 --> 26:32.869
- I got a letter from Ann today.
- Oh, you must be pleased.

26:33.000 --> 26:39.678
.Peter hasn't written for weeks.
.Well, he'll have written, of course, but...

26:39.800 --> 26:42.598
.She sold our house.

26:42.720 --> 26:44.676
.Just like that.

26:48.160 --> 26:52.756
.She put the furniture into storage, packed
.up the kids and moved in with her family.

26:52.880 --> 26:56.634
- Didn't want to bother you.
- She didn't tell me till after it was done.

26:56.760 --> 27:01.550
- She doesn't even like her family.
- Perhaps she didn't want to be alone.

27:01.680 --> 27:04.592
.I wonder why she didn't tell me, though.

27:05.240 --> 27:07.231
.Do you tell her everything?

27:09.040 --> 27:11.349
.So far.

27:17.400 --> 27:20.198
.I remember we did talk about it.

27:20.320 --> 27:23.392
.I mean, when I knew
.I was gonna come overseas here,

27:23.520 --> 27:27.115
.and the fact that I might not come back.

27:27.240 --> 27:31.677
- She'd be saddled with responsibilities.
- That's a bit pessimistic, isn't it?

27:32.400 --> 27:34.960
.Yeah, I think she'd call it realistic.

27:35.080 --> 27:39.358
.When Peter went away, we decided
.we'd play it down, take it in our stride.

27:39.480 --> 27:41.436
.Everyone did. We had to.

27:41.560 --> 27:43.676
.Three very long years.

27:43.800 --> 27:48.590
.Where would we have been
.if we'd been realistic?

27:50.280 --> 27:53.352
- Here.
- Oh! Thank you.

27:53.480 --> 27:58.270
- Here you go, ma'am.
- Hello. Ooh!

28:03.760 --> 28:05.716
.Stop that!

29:12.440 --> 29:14.396
- Son of a bitch!
- All right!

29:14.520 --> 29:17.592
.Go on. Shoot one. Shoot one.

29:17.960 --> 29:20.679
- What happened to Liverpool?
- Football final!

29:20.800 --> 29:22.950
.Come on, get your paper!

29:23.080 --> 29:26.436
- Hello, Jean.
- Oh, hello, Mrs Bradshaw.

29:28.080 --> 29:30.674
- Get a load of that!
- Hey, baby!

29:30.800 --> 29:35.351
- How about a drink?
- How about me? Mine's a port and lemon.

29:43.280 --> 29:45.794
.That Betty Grable's a bit of all right!

29:45.920 --> 29:49.276
- Hurry up. It's starting.
- Two 1/9s. That'll be 3/6.

29:49.400 --> 29:52.836
- Hey, look. Do you like that?
- I like it just a whole lot.

29:52.960 --> 29:56.509
- That's a shame, cos I saw her first.
- Three.

30:02.920 --> 30:05.388
- Hi, honey. How are you?
- Hello.

30:05.520 --> 30:08.990
.We've got a problem.
.My stupid buddy bought three tickets.

30:09.120 --> 30:11.270
- Wanna join us.
- No, thank you.

30:11.400 --> 30:14.039
- Waiting for someone?
- I'm waiting for a friend.

30:14.160 --> 30:16.116
.Boyfriend, girlfriend, what?

30:16.240 --> 30:18.356
.Give the lady a drink.

30:18.480 --> 30:20.436
- Have a drink.
- No, I don't care for it.

30:20.560 --> 30:23.233
.What are you doing?
.Want me to wring your neck?

30:23.360 --> 30:26.830
- Hey! Hey!
- Hey, sarge, come on. Have a drink.

30:27.920 --> 30:31.959
- You wanna drink? You wanna drink?
- Matt! Matt, please!

30:33.360 --> 30:35.920
.Come on. Jesus!

30:38.720 --> 30:41.598
.Oh! Not bad for a Scotsman!

30:41.720 --> 30:45.633
- What did you say yours was, Tex?
- Half-and-half.

30:45.760 --> 30:49.070
- A chaser.
- Two chasers and a pint of bitter, please.

30:49.200 --> 30:51.839
.Two chasers.
.He's not a bad dart thrower, Tex, is he?

30:51.960 --> 30:55.748
- He's getting better every night, this one.
- A twenty, a five and a bull!

30:55.880 --> 30:57.836
.Right, son. What can I do you for?

30:57.960 --> 31:02.272
.Yeah, I'd like a sherry and a half-and-half.

31:02.400 --> 31:04.755
.Half-and-half coming up. New in?

31:04.880 --> 31:06.871
.Yeah. Last month.

31:07.000 --> 31:09.912
- Bloody cold, eh?
- Cold? Cold I can take.

31:10.040 --> 31:12.759
- I don't know about this wet.
- You'll get used to the wet.

31:12.880 --> 31:16.714
.Another couple of months, you'll be
.coughing your guts up with the rest of us.

31:16.840 --> 31:19.115
.Now, then. Sweet or dry?

31:21.680 --> 31:24.638
- What do you think?
- Sweet.

31:26.080 --> 31:30.870
.Bloody Yanks.
.Bloody Yanks coming over here.

31:32.280 --> 31:36.432
.Why don't you bugger off home,
.back where you bloody belong?

31:37.560 --> 31:42.839
.Sir, I didn't ask to come to this country.
.I was drafted.

31:42.960 --> 31:48.080
.If you've got any kind of influence,
.I'd be grateful to get back where I belong.

31:48.200 --> 31:50.156
.The sooner the better.

31:52.360 --> 31:54.316
.Sherry.

31:57.800 --> 32:01.952
.Take no notice, lad.
.He's just lost his boy. Burma.

32:03.000 --> 32:05.719
- Right, lads.
- One bitter, please.

32:05.840 --> 32:08.400
- And half-and-half.
- Coming up.

32:14.120 --> 32:16.714
.Sometimes I got a big mouth.

32:18.560 --> 32:20.755
.Say things I shouldn't.

32:23.520 --> 32:29.356
- How do you drink warm beer?
- It should be easy with a big mouth.

32:29.480 --> 32:31.835
- Evening.
- Evening, George.

32:36.560 --> 32:39.028
.That's our diner, there.

32:39.160 --> 32:42.357
.Just outside of Tucson, Arizona.

32:42.480 --> 32:46.519
.Own that free and clear.
.Dad does, anyway.

32:46.640 --> 32:49.438
.That's him. Dad and my brother Eddie.

32:50.160 --> 32:52.515
.The pretty one there is me.

32:52.640 --> 32:55.598
.I'm the short-order cook there mostly.

32:55.720 --> 32:59.190
- Short-order?
- Hot dogs, hamburgers, cheeseburgers.

32:59.320 --> 33:03.279
- Oh, you mean snacks?
- Yeah, I guess so. Snacks.

33:04.440 --> 33:06.749
."Adam and Eve on a raft."

33:06.880 --> 33:10.190
.Know what that is?
.Two poached eggs on toast.

33:14.120 --> 33:17.078
- You got a nice smile.
- Thank you.

33:18.880 --> 33:20.996
.You ought to smile more often.

33:23.960 --> 33:26.554
.Where's your mother?

33:26.680 --> 33:31.117
.She died when I was a kid.
.I don't remember her too much.

33:33.480 --> 33:36.119
.After the war are you going back
.to work for your dad?

33:36.240 --> 33:38.037
.Not a chance.

33:40.040 --> 33:42.998
.I haven't told anybody this before.

33:43.120 --> 33:45.475
.You know what a motel is?

33:45.600 --> 33:52.039
.Well, a motel is kinda like a hotel
.on the highway, you know.

33:52.160 --> 33:55.311
.You stop off there. You got
.your own little cabin and bathroom.

33:55.440 --> 33:59.638
.They're springing up all over the States.
.I'm gonna build me one of them.

33:59.760 --> 34:04.197
.I got a place all picked out too.
.It's on a canyon.

34:04.320 --> 34:07.471
.The top of the canyon flattens out
.and I'm gonna build it there.

34:07.600 --> 34:13.038
.It's beautiful. Out there you've still got
.wide open spaces. Roads are straight.

34:13.159 --> 34:18.313
.Not like here. When I come here,
.I feel kinda hemmed in, you know.

34:19.960 --> 34:22.632
.Anyway, that's what I'm gonna do.

34:23.480 --> 34:26.313
- I'm sure you will.
- I will.

34:27.120 --> 34:31.875
.And when that one gets going,
.I'm gonna build another one.

34:32.880 --> 34:35.713
.And then I'm gonna build another one.

34:35.840 --> 34:38.034
.And another one.

34:44.120 --> 34:47.078
.Your guy, does he bring you up here?

34:47.199 --> 34:49.475
.Ken? Yes, since we were kids.

34:49.600 --> 34:52.637
- Known him a long time, then?
- We grew up together.

34:52.760 --> 34:56.309
.That could be nice.
.No surprises any more.

34:59.880 --> 35:01.996
.You in love with him?

35:03.920 --> 35:08.118
- He's everything I've ever wanted.
- That's not what I asked.

35:08.240 --> 35:10.595
.I heard what you asked.

35:10.720 --> 35:13.075
.Everybody loves Ken.

35:18.480 --> 35:21.950
.I guess all the luck didn't fall on Arizona.

35:27.520 --> 35:31.274
- Morning, Sally!
- Get to the back of the queue!

35:31.400 --> 35:34.551
.It's for oranges, love.

35:35.960 --> 35:38.554
.Ooh! About time an' all!

35:40.640 --> 35:43.757
.Do you mean the one who was here
.the other day for bicycle clips?

35:43.880 --> 35:46.030
.Yes, Mother. He's a friend.

35:46.160 --> 35:50.711
.You've always told me to bring my friends
.home. He wants to meet you.

35:50.840 --> 35:53.513
- I've no wish to meet him.
- Who the hell are you?

35:53.640 --> 35:56.359
.Jean. Jean.

35:56.480 --> 35:59.552
.I'm sorry.

35:59.680 --> 36:04.276
- He's different, Mother. He's decent.
- Decent! How do you know he's decent?

36:04.400 --> 36:07.119
- Plenty of them are.
- You know plenty of them?

36:07.240 --> 36:09.993
.No, of course I don't.

36:13.680 --> 36:16.399
.I don't understand
.how you can put Ken in this position,

36:16.520 --> 36:18.988
.knowing how people feel
.about these Americans.

36:19.120 --> 36:22.192
- He knows about Ken. He understands.
- How do you know?

36:22.320 --> 36:26.552
.Because in three weeks
.he's never touched me.

36:27.640 --> 36:29.915
- Come on, love!

36:30.040 --> 36:32.429
.I wish they'd have a bit of patience.

36:33.400 --> 36:38.235
.I'll be with you in a minute, ladies.
.It's not even 8.30 yet.

36:38.360 --> 36:41.989
.Now, look, Jean.
.Your lad's away in the army.

36:42.120 --> 36:44.270
.You can't ride two horses with one arse.

36:44.400 --> 36:47.472
.We enjoy one another's company,
.that's all.

36:47.600 --> 36:50.160
.He asked me to tell you
.before somebody else did.

36:50.280 --> 36:52.430
.It doesn't affect Ken and me.

36:54.320 --> 36:56.595
- Where do you want this?
- Where they can see it.

36:56.720 --> 37:01.669
.I don't want any more arguments
.this morning. I don't feel up to it.

37:01.800 --> 37:06.316
- Come on, Clarrie.
- Sorry. I won't be a minute.

37:07.520 --> 37:11.718
- Sorry.
- You took your time, didn't you, love?

37:11.840 --> 37:14.877
- Good morning.
- Nice to see you.

37:15.000 --> 37:17.753
.Hello. Come on in, it's cold.

37:17.880 --> 37:22.271
.Sorry, just one each. Sorry.
.The missus'll sort it all out.

37:22.400 --> 37:27.110
.Jean. I don't want to be prejudiced.
.Honestly I don't.

37:27.240 --> 37:30.471
.So you can ask your friend round
.for tea on Sunday.

37:30.600 --> 37:34.195
- Thanks, Mother.
- Let's hope nobody tells Ken about it.

37:34.320 --> 37:38.029
.Now, then, ladies. Let's have
.a bit of order here, shall we, please?

37:38.160 --> 37:42.392
- Can you serve me first?
- I was first in the queue!

37:45.120 --> 37:46.917
. That is why I want you to know...

37:47.040 --> 37:49.918
... want you to know
.that it was only an accident

37:50.040 --> 37:53.715
.and I didn't get damaged
.anywhere important.

37:53.840 --> 37:56.115
... damaged anywhere important.

37:56.240 --> 37:58.196
.Think she's gonna know
.what that means?

37:58.320 --> 38:01.756
.Well, she wouldn't know
.if she saw you now.

38:01.880 --> 38:05.236
.I want her to know
.that I'm not gonna be able to walk so good

38:05.360 --> 38:09.319
.but I can still... you know.

38:09.440 --> 38:11.396
.Hm. You can still...

38:11.520 --> 38:15.957
.I want it to be not... you know, crude...

38:17.160 --> 38:19.993
.Why don't you tell her
.that you can still make love?

38:20.120 --> 38:22.076
.Yeah.

38:22.200 --> 38:27.672
...was only an accident and I didn't
.get damaged anywhere important.

38:30.120 --> 38:32.076
.Get out! Be off!

38:32.200 --> 38:35.237
. Post, Miss Helen!

38:35.360 --> 38:39.478
- Get down, I tell you!
- Riley! Come here!

38:40.760 --> 38:45.595
- Morning, Arthur. How's your grandson?
- He's doing champion, thanks very much.

38:45.720 --> 38:49.554
- There's nothing from the navy.
- No, there isn't.

38:49.680 --> 38:51.193
.Thank you.

38:51.320 --> 38:53.436
.Get down, will you?

38:53.560 --> 38:56.632
.It's mostly bills.

38:56.760 --> 39:00.116
- There's one from Tim.
- Oh, poor kid.

39:00.240 --> 39:04.472
- If you ask me, I think it'd be best if...

39:14.320 --> 39:18.677
. "Dear Mum, please let me come
.home. I hate it here."

39:18.800 --> 39:21.951
."They bully me because they say
.I don't try hard enough at games,

39:22.080 --> 39:24.833
.but I do my best."

39:24.960 --> 39:29.875
."I don't want to let you and Daddy down,
.but I want to come home so, so much."

39:30.000 --> 39:34.994
."I don't fit in here.
.You must understand. Please."

39:35.120 --> 39:37.315
."All my love, Tim."

39:54.400 --> 39:58.154
- Very good. Well done, darling.
- Jolly good.

39:59.280 --> 40:03.717
- How's Anna?
- Fine. She sends glowing letters.

40:03.840 --> 40:06.912
.I'm afraid Tim's inherited
.all my insecurities.

40:07.040 --> 40:08.996
.Oh, Helen, he'll soon settle down.

40:09.120 --> 40:12.590
.We had the same problem with Patrick
.when he first went away to school.

40:12.720 --> 40:14.676
.You mustn't give in to him.

40:14.800 --> 40:18.713
.Nobody likes to see a boy unhappy,
.but you must not give in.

40:18.840 --> 40:21.957
- Some take longer than others.
- A question of backbone.

40:22.080 --> 40:24.958
.You have to ask yourself "What is it..."

40:27.640 --> 40:30.473
.Do you think I should bring Tim home?

40:32.000 --> 40:36.676
.I don't think a kid should have to
.stay miserable for the sake of tradition.

40:36.800 --> 40:40.031
.It's a very good school.
.He could get over his problems.

40:40.160 --> 40:44.597
- Peter and all his family went there.
- Yeah, well, Tim's not Peter.

40:46.560 --> 40:51.793
- You don't believe in tradition?
- Not in that kind. Neither do you.

40:52.480 --> 40:56.393
.Do what you feel
.and never mind duties, responsibilities...

40:56.520 --> 41:00.354
.All those things aren't much unless
.you can support them with feelings.

41:01.480 --> 41:03.948
.They hold you together sometimes.

41:04.080 --> 41:07.356
.Let them go. You won't fall apart.

41:08.800 --> 41:10.756
.Are you happy?

41:12.960 --> 41:15.633
.I like what I'm doing.

41:17.800 --> 41:20.155
.Do you sleep well at night?

41:20.280 --> 41:22.635
.Planes keep me awake.

41:27.880 --> 41:31.714
.You're incredibly beautiful, you know.

41:35.080 --> 41:37.036
.Thank you.

41:39.880 --> 41:43.714
- I've said that to a lot of women.
- I'm sure you have.

41:44.440 --> 41:47.000
.I even meant it once or twice.

41:54.480 --> 41:58.519
.Nobody's ever surprised me like you do,
.you know.

42:02.960 --> 42:05.394
.Go with your instincts.

42:07.520 --> 42:10.080
.You make it too simple.

42:10.200 --> 42:12.839
.I come from a simple, primitive people.

42:12.960 --> 42:15.633
.Mongrels. We got no traditions.

42:18.400 --> 42:20.436
.Trust your feelings.

42:21.920 --> 42:27.074
.I feel...
.that you should go back to the camp

42:27.200 --> 42:29.839
.and I should go up to bed.

42:30.760 --> 42:33.991
.Wrong again. Don't trust what you feel.

42:53.840 --> 42:58.152
.Thank you, John.
.You do help me, you know.

42:58.280 --> 43:00.919
.Just think of me as the Red Cross.

43:09.000 --> 43:11.958
.Don't let the planes keep you awake.

43:27.040 --> 43:29.759
.First time you've cooked
.since you've been sergeant.

43:29.880 --> 43:32.314
.Why do you think they promoted him?

43:32.440 --> 43:34.954
.Who are you poisoning this time?

43:35.080 --> 43:37.719
.Fuck you and the boat that brought you.

43:37.840 --> 43:40.274
.Look! He's using real eggs!

43:40.400 --> 43:43.915
- It's got to be for a girl.
- What else is worth all the trouble?

43:44.840 --> 43:47.877
.You ever noticed
.how much limey giris stink?

43:48.000 --> 43:51.709
.As a matter of fact, it's not just the giris.
.All limeys stink.

43:51.840 --> 43:55.833
- What do you mean, stink?
- They don't wash, so they stink.

43:55.960 --> 43:58.838
- Some stink. Some don't stink.
- They all stink.

43:58.960 --> 44:01.554
.Their hair, their clothes,
.everything about them.

44:01.680 --> 44:04.558
.We must be getting used to it.
.But they still stink.

44:04.680 --> 44:07.194
- My girl don't stink.
- You don't smell it any more.

44:07.320 --> 44:10.995
.No, I've seen her wash.
.I don't wanna hear no more about it.

44:11.120 --> 44:13.793
.OK, sarge. OK.

44:13.920 --> 44:16.639
- She don't stink.
- OK.

44:19.160 --> 44:22.436
.Even if she did, you know what? I'd like it.

44:27.080 --> 44:29.753
- The table looks lovely, Mother.
- Is it all right?

44:29.880 --> 44:32.599
- Ham as well?
- You wouldn't know we were rationed.

44:32.720 --> 44:38.716
.Let's hope he likes it, Jean. Geoffrey, go
.and fetch me some chutney. Home-made.

44:38.840 --> 44:41.593
.There's an article
.about the three Roberts boys.

44:41.720 --> 44:45.838
.Lost at sea when the ship went down.
.I'd better call round.

44:45.960 --> 44:48.474
.Don't mention that
.in front of the American, Jim.

44:48.600 --> 44:49.953
.Why the hell not?

44:50.080 --> 44:53.277
.Wouldn't be tactful.
.He's not seen active service.

44:56.480 --> 44:59.756
- It's the Yank.
- Why didn't you open the door?

44:59.880 --> 45:02.348
.He's not coming to see me.

45:04.720 --> 45:07.553
- Hi.
- Hello. Would you like to come in?

45:07.680 --> 45:09.636
.Thank you.

45:11.080 --> 45:14.277
- I hope I'm not late.
- No.

45:14.400 --> 45:16.470
.No, of course not.

45:18.960 --> 45:21.599
- This is my brother Geoff.
- Geoff.

45:21.720 --> 45:23.676
.How you doing? Hi, I'm Matt.

45:23.800 --> 45:25.233
- Hiya.
- Put it there.

45:25.360 --> 45:30.639
.I brought you some things I thought
.you might like. Candy, comic books.

45:30.760 --> 45:34.389
- Can I take your coat?
- Yeah, thanks.

45:39.640 --> 45:42.234
- Mother, this is Matt.
- Hello.

45:42.360 --> 45:45.636
- Matt, this is my dad.
- Nice to see you again, ma'am.

45:45.760 --> 45:47.512
.I appreciate you asking me here.

45:47.640 --> 45:50.632
- Mr Moreton.
- How do you do, son?

45:50.760 --> 45:53.832
- I brought this for you, ma'am.
- Oh. Thank you.

45:53.960 --> 45:57.270
- Look what I got. A tin of fruit.
- That's very nice.

45:57.400 --> 45:59.960
- Matthew, isn't it?
- Yeah, that's right.

46:00.080 --> 46:03.470
- After the apostle.
- Yeah.

46:03.600 --> 46:07.559
- I hope you won't be offended, sir.
- Oh, thanks.

46:09.240 --> 46:12.630
.Offended? No. Thank you very much.

46:12.760 --> 46:16.594
- Yes.
- Aren't you going to open yours, Mother?

46:30.560 --> 46:33.836
- Nice!
- Oh, it's lovely!

46:34.800 --> 46:38.076
.It's made with real eggs, ma'am.

46:38.200 --> 46:41.476
- You made it?
- That's right, ma'am. Just me.

46:42.800 --> 46:46.475
.Well, it really is lovely.

46:46.600 --> 46:50.479
.But I don't think we'll have it tonight,
.thank you very much.

46:50.600 --> 46:53.239
.We've got quite enough already.

46:57.680 --> 47:01.514
.We're having this tonight, no danger.
.Thanks.

47:29.200 --> 47:32.715
- How you doing, Mr Moreton?
- Fine, fine.

47:34.680 --> 47:38.070
- This is a beautiful town round here.
- Yes, it is.

47:38.200 --> 47:40.998
.Wonderful, wonderful country.

47:42.360 --> 47:44.874
.We don't get fresh ham often.
.It's usually canned.

47:45.000 --> 47:48.879
.It's nice for us.
.Special occasión, you know.

47:52.640 --> 47:56.349
- Do you grow these vegetables yourself?
- No. We have done.

47:56.480 --> 48:00.155
- You have a garden. I saw it.
- Jim's a very good gardener.

48:00.280 --> 48:02.999
.We have a garden back in Arizona.

48:06.640 --> 48:09.791
- I really can't eat any more, Mrs Moreton.
- Did you enjoy it?

48:09.920 --> 48:12.150
- Can I have that, please?
- No.

48:12.280 --> 48:14.840
.Can I have your plates, please?

48:32.600 --> 48:36.115
.This? That's something
.I sent the wife from the front.

48:36.240 --> 48:39.471
.They came round
.with the needles and ribbons and that.

48:39.600 --> 48:42.910
- You made it?
- Yeah. Strange, really, isn't it?

48:43.040 --> 48:45.315
- What are these?
- The medals they gave us.

48:45.440 --> 48:49.991
.That's the victory medal there,
.and the 1914-18 war...

48:51.120 --> 48:53.634
.That's what we call a pineapple.

48:53.760 --> 48:57.150
- A pineapple?
- Here. Give that a try.

49:00.880 --> 49:03.440
- Good, isn't it?
- Yeah, great.

49:03.560 --> 49:07.314
.Now we'll try this thing here.
.Here's a peach.

49:14.160 --> 49:16.799
.I can see what you see in him, Jean.

49:16.920 --> 49:19.718
.He's thoughtful. Very pleasant.

49:21.800 --> 49:23.756
.If it wasn't for Ken...

49:23.880 --> 49:27.031
.I just wish we knew more about him.

49:30.400 --> 49:32.436
.That's it, Danny! Kill the limey!

49:41.200 --> 49:45.830
- Bloody Yankee!
- Get away from him! Stay away!

49:45.960 --> 49:48.394
. Smash his bloody ugly face in!

49:48.520 --> 49:50.431
.Hit him! Keep your head up!

49:53.320 --> 49:55.515
.Hit him in the guts! Come on! Go!

49:57.080 --> 49:59.036
.Go on, Danny!

50:01.440 --> 50:03.829
. Danny, get that limey bastard!

50:10.480 --> 50:13.790
. All the way, USA!

50:13.920 --> 50:16.798
.All right, Danny! Champ!

50:51.840 --> 50:52.875
.How are you?

50:53.000 --> 50:56.470
- All right. How long you home for?
- Two weeks of freedom.

50:56.600 --> 51:01.037
- Let's wear your hat.
- Go on, shorty, but I want it back.

51:01.160 --> 51:03.993
- Hello, Mrs Shenton.
- Hello, Ken, love. Welcome home.

51:04.120 --> 51:06.270
.Thank you. You're looking well.

51:06.400 --> 51:08.675
.How are you? Can I carry your kitbag?

51:08.800 --> 51:10.995
.No mucking about. Government property.

51:11.120 --> 51:14.715
.Come on, shorty. Pick your feet up.

51:29.280 --> 51:31.271
.You all right, lad?

51:32.160 --> 51:34.958
.Huh? Yeah, I'm all right.

51:56.960 --> 51:59.520
.Come on, snap out of it.

52:04.160 --> 52:09.792
.Well, Jean, you're a grand girl and
.we've watched you grow up with pride.

52:11.160 --> 52:13.151
.And we don't give you away easy.

52:13.280 --> 52:16.716
.It'd take a special kind of lad
.to persuade us.

52:16.840 --> 52:19.035
.But Ken here, well, he is.

52:19.160 --> 52:24.188
.You know, us old 'uns,
.we do our best here at home.

52:24.320 --> 52:27.312
.But it's youngsters like these two
.that bear the brunt.

52:27.440 --> 52:32.116
.The danger, the separation and the worry.

52:33.640 --> 52:35.915
.So good luck to you both.

52:36.040 --> 52:38.076
.And let's hope this bloody war's over

52:38.200 --> 52:41.397
.by the time we all get together
.to put the rubber stamp on it.

52:41.520 --> 52:45.069
- Hear! Hear!
- So raise your glasses to Jean and Ken.

52:45.200 --> 52:48.510
- Jean and Ken.
- All the luck in the worid.

52:48.640 --> 52:51.632
- Congratulations, love.
- Thanks, Auntie Maud.

52:53.400 --> 52:56.472
.Come on. You act
.like she's the only girl in the worid.

52:56.600 --> 52:59.637
.You ever hear of other fish in the sea?

53:02.480 --> 53:05.040
.Like that one right over there?

53:05.160 --> 53:07.913
.She's nice, but she's with somebody.

53:17.280 --> 53:18.952
.Chee.

53:26.240 --> 53:30.836
.Excuse me. Would you care
.to take a little twirl round the dance floor?

53:32.160 --> 53:34.799
- I'm just having a drink.
- The lady's with me.

53:34.920 --> 53:37.514
.She doesn't want to dance.

53:37.640 --> 53:39.756
.I didn't hear her.

53:39.880 --> 53:41.836
.Do you wanna dance with me?

53:41.960 --> 53:44.838
.Well, no, thanks. I'm with friends.

53:44.960 --> 53:47.872
- Why don't you...
- You don't dance with Americans?

53:48.000 --> 53:50.833
- Look, shove off.
- No, I don't dance with Americans.

53:50.960 --> 53:54.953
- We're having a good time. Leave us.
- Don't dance?

53:55.880 --> 53:58.997
- I got cigarettes here. Want cigarettes?
- No, thanks.

53:59.120 --> 54:02.237
.You take cigarettes from Americans.
.Have a cigarette.

54:02.360 --> 54:05.079
- Have a couple of cigarettes.
- That's gone in my drink.

54:05.200 --> 54:07.509
- Maybe some whisky...
- We don't want any.

54:07.640 --> 54:10.279
- Drinks on me!

54:13.640 --> 54:15.596
.Bloody hell!

54:20.160 --> 54:22.913
. Come on, let's get outta here!

54:24.480 --> 54:28.598
.Come on, man! Move it! Go! Go! Go!

54:29.600 --> 54:33.275
.# I like your lips and I like your eyes

54:38.680 --> 54:42.195
- Whoa! What the hell's going on?
- Try down here!

54:42.320 --> 54:45.073
.Yanks. Yanks.

54:45.200 --> 54:48.749
.Come on!
.Round the back here! Further on!

54:48.880 --> 54:51.553
.Jean.

54:51.680 --> 54:54.274
- Jean.
- Hey.

54:54.400 --> 54:57.870
- Hey. You OK?
- Yeah.

54:59.640 --> 55:02.393
.Come on. We need a drink. Let's go.

55:03.640 --> 55:06.473
- Teddy! Teddy, open up!
- Come on.

55:06.600 --> 55:09.194
- Teddy, we want a drink.
- Come on, he's not here.

55:09.320 --> 55:12.073
- Teddy!
- You're gonna wake everybody up!

55:12.200 --> 55:15.556
- Rise and shine, Teddy!
- You're crazy!

55:15.680 --> 55:17.910
.What the bloody hell's going on?

55:18.040 --> 55:20.952
.Do you realise what time it is?
.What the hell do you want?

55:21.080 --> 55:23.230
- We want a drink.
- Oh, it's you two, is it?

55:23.360 --> 55:28.150
- Get us a half-and-half.
- OK, lads. Half-and-half coming up.

55:28.280 --> 55:33.593
- Half-and-half, half-and-half!
- Half's mine and half's the wife's.

55:36.280 --> 55:38.874
- Shit!
- It's piss.

55:42.760 --> 55:45.752
- All right, Eddie!
- Wait a minute!

55:45.880 --> 55:49.714
- Oh, Jesus Christ.
- Take your hands off me.

55:51.160 --> 55:53.879
.Sounds to me
.like you were looking for a fight.

55:54.000 --> 55:55.353
.Yeah, I was, sir.

55:56.040 --> 55:58.474
.You've been running
.with the Moreton girl?

56:00.080 --> 56:04.119
.Yeah, I took her out a couple of times.
.Nothing serious.

56:06.320 --> 56:09.437
.It's very easy to get involved
.with women while you're over here.

56:10.400 --> 56:13.597
.But it's their country
.and you gotta play by their rules,

56:14.480 --> 56:17.392
.even if you don't understand
.them sometimes.

56:18.680 --> 56:23.037
Look, sir, I got drunk,
made a damn fool of myself.

56:23.720 --> 56:25.676
No excuses.

56:26.720 --> 56:29.439
Confine them
to the company area for a week.

56:29.560 --> 56:32.472
If you're caught fighting again,
we'll take your stripes.

56:32.600 --> 56:34.556
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

56:34.680 --> 56:36.636
Take a hike.

56:41.800 --> 56:48.990
On platform one, London Euston train,
calling at Stockport and London Euston.

56:49.120 --> 56:52.556
Nice to have something
to laugh about, eh?

56:55.400 --> 56:58.073
- Ken...
- Listen, Jean.

56:58.200 --> 57:00.839
The er... The garage.

57:00.960 --> 57:04.191
My dad says it's mine
when it's all over.

57:05.440 --> 57:07.715
I'd like it.

57:07.840 --> 57:12.152
I can build something for us out of it,
honest.

57:12.280 --> 57:14.953
I know you can. I know that.

57:15.080 --> 57:20.518
It would be pretty plain sailing, Jean,
you and me. Maybe a bit too plain.

57:21.280 --> 57:26.434
If we come through it the same,
at least we'll be certain, won't we?

57:27.240 --> 57:30.915
Just get back, eh? Just get back safe.

57:38.560 --> 57:47.229
Train at platform one is the London train
calling at Crewe, Stockport and London.

57:47.360 --> 57:50.830
Passengers for North Wales,
change at Crewe.

58:03.240 --> 58:05.196
Passengers for North Wales...

58:05.320 --> 58:10.348
Hey, lads, where you going?
They're not as cheap as us in London.

58:10.480 --> 58:13.870
- I don't envy you that lot.
- Shall I send you one for Christmas?

58:14.000 --> 58:17.515
No, thanks. I think I'd rather
take on the flaming Japs.

58:18.200 --> 58:20.794
- Ken...
- Now, you're not to worry, kid.

58:20.920 --> 58:25.311
This new lot I'm joining, they're
no mugs. Crack troops.

58:25.440 --> 58:28.989
Better than scrubbing around
in the infantry, eh?

58:29.120 --> 58:33.318
- There's something I want...

58:35.920 --> 58:39.356
I love you, kid. Be happy on your say-so.

58:39.480 --> 58:43.029
- I'm asking nothing, right?
- Ken, please.

58:45.600 --> 58:48.910
- I'll be thinking of you every minute.
- Ken, look after yourself.

58:49.040 --> 58:51.474
- Look after yourself.
- Goodbye.

58:51.600 --> 58:54.751
- Don't forget to write.
- Goodbye.

58:54.880 --> 58:57.269
Bye.

58:57.400 --> 58:59.755
Goodbye!

58:59.880 --> 59:02.599
- See you soon!
- Bye!

59:43.320 --> 59:47.552
# I'll be seeing you

59:47.680 --> 59:52.800
# In every lovely summer's day

59:53.200 --> 59:58.035
# In everything that's bright and gay

59:58.160 --> 01:00:02.676
# I'll always think of you that way

01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:07.794
# I'll find you in the morning sun

01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:12.436
# And when the night is new

01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:16.235
# I'll be looking at the moon

01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:20.399
# But I'll be seeing you

01:00:20.520 --> 01:00:22.670
- Ice cream!

01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:25.758
Everybody likes ice cream!

01:00:36.760 --> 01:00:40.309
Ice... You want ice cream?
We got ice cream.

01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:48.869
# I'll find you in the morning sun

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:53.039
# And when the night is new

01:00:53.160 --> 01:00:56.948
# I'll be looking at the moon

01:00:57.080 --> 01:01:04.316
# But I'll be seeing you

01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:23.316
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:25.510
You having a good time?

01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:39.395
Ladies and gentlemen, we're just about
to say goodbye to 1943, hello to 1944

01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:41.829
in ten seconds.

01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:45.839
Nine, eight, seven, six,

01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:50.431
five, four, three, two, one!

01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:53.393
Happy New Year!

01:01:56.400 --> 01:01:59.039
Happy New Year, Jean.

01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:01.276
Happy New Year.

01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:07.917
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:13.512
# Should auld acquaintance be forgot

01:02:13.640 --> 01:02:17.997
# For the sake of auld lang syne

01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:22.636

01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:06.432
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:14.030
- Where were we?
- In London. We went up specially.

01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:16.151
- Happy New Year.

01:03:16.280 --> 01:03:19.352

- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:24.518
- Happy New Year.

01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:28.189
- I'll go.
- No, it's all right, lvy. I'll get it.

01:03:32.920 --> 01:03:35.514
- 348.

01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:37.756
Oh, hello.
