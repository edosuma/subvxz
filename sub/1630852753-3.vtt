WEBVTT

00:12.012 --> 00:13.764
Okay.
Just so we're on the same page,

00:13.847 --> 00:17.309
whoever wrote that on your neck
also wrote the threatening note.

00:17.392 --> 00:19.645
- But how do we know who it is?
- Okay, so here's the plan.

00:19.728 --> 00:21.522
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna get everybody in this house

00:21.605 --> 00:25.025
to write the word "diarrhea,"
like it's written here,

00:25.108 --> 00:27.569
and then compare the handwriting style,
see if it matches.

00:27.653 --> 00:30.781
I don't get it, but I'm gonna be the first
to do it. So come on, watch this.

00:30.864 --> 00:34.409
This is what I'm gonna do. But why don't
you just have them write the capital E?

00:34.493 --> 00:37.496
Well, because whoever did this used
the backwards E's and misspelled the word.

00:37.579 --> 00:38.580
That's the killer.

00:38.664 --> 00:42.125
One "diarrhea" coming up.

00:42.209 --> 00:44.795
Cha-cha-cha! Did I kill him?

00:44.878 --> 00:47.256
Well, you misspelled it.
But the wrong way.

00:47.339 --> 00:49.758
It's really hard to spell.
What about those E's?

00:49.842 --> 00:52.302
You knew about the backwards E's.
Not gonna work on you.

00:52.386 --> 00:54.721
Unless I had a different sample
of my writing

00:54.805 --> 00:56.974
to prove that that's how I do my E's.

00:57.057 --> 00:58.392
- Whoo-pow!
- Ah, yeah.

00:58.475 --> 01:01.019
Capital E, perfect way,
with an S to impress.

01:01.103 --> 01:03.397
- Yeah. See? There you--
- So Chelsea's a suspect then?

01:03.480 --> 01:05.691
- It's Culp and Danner.
- There's still a big gap

01:05.774 --> 01:08.861
between Brett and Aniq's story,
including Aniq's hazy period

01:08.944 --> 01:11.446
before he passed out when he was drunk

01:11.530 --> 01:13.699
and conveniently
doesn't remember anything.

01:13.782 --> 01:16.618
Right now, he's up to something
in the bathroom. Just saying.

01:16.702 --> 01:19.580
We've got to get out of here. I've got
to get everybody's writing samples.

01:19.663 --> 01:22.124
If I'm gonna clear my name,
I need hard evidence.

01:23.876 --> 01:26.920
Holy shit, dude. Holy shit.

01:27.004 --> 01:29.131
I just saved your life. Say thank you now.

01:29.214 --> 01:30.841
- Thank you.
- You want hard evidence?

01:30.924 --> 01:34.011
There is a secret hidden camera
in Xavier's bedroom.

01:34.094 --> 01:37.723
It is in Oates's eye in the Private Eyes
movie poster. Watching you.

01:37.806 --> 01:39.933
Or maybe it was Hall.
I don't know which is which.

01:40.017 --> 01:41.018
You installed cameras?

01:41.101 --> 01:43.687
It wasn't me. It was a different company.
You should never use them.

01:43.770 --> 01:47.107
You should come to me. But I noticed them
when I was installing my A/V equipment.

01:47.191 --> 01:48.567
Do you know what that means?

01:48.650 --> 01:50.944
- There's evidence that exonerates me.
- Yes!

01:51.028 --> 01:54.281
- That shows the real killer!
- That shows that you are not the killer.

01:54.364 --> 01:56.742
- Yasper, you're amazing.
- I am amazing.

01:56.825 --> 01:58.243
- Have a dance, have a dance.
- Yeah.

01:58.327 --> 01:59.953
Have a dance.

02:00.037 --> 02:02.122
This really should be more intuitive.

02:02.206 --> 02:04.333
Okay. Go ahead and just rewind it back
by three hours.

02:04.416 --> 02:07.377
You know what? It looks like the laptop
is hooked up into the consoles.

02:07.461 --> 02:10.672
This does not look very user-friendly.
I would have nailed this out of the park,

02:10.756 --> 02:12.633
but I think I can help you
access the footage.

02:12.716 --> 02:13.717
- We're good.
- Hey.

02:13.800 --> 02:17.095
Just let the police do their thing.
All right, A/V guy?

02:17.179 --> 02:19.223
It doesn't seem like this guy
knows what he's doing.

02:19.306 --> 02:24.645
Suspects do not handle evidence!
'Kay? Thank you.

02:24.728 --> 02:26.188
You're pressing the wrong buttons.

02:26.271 --> 02:28.732
Please. Stand back. Thanks.

02:28.815 --> 02:31.777
- I can't watch this.
- Okay. Literally called him "A/V guy."

02:31.860 --> 02:33.779
Just click on this right here,
and then that one…

02:33.862 --> 02:37.908
You know what I'm gonna do?
I am going to craft a meanly worded tweet.

02:37.991 --> 02:38.992
And here it comes.

02:39.076 --> 02:41.286
@marincountysheriffsdepartment,

02:41.370 --> 02:45.165
add me to the long list of people
who have been oppressed by the police.

02:45.249 --> 02:47.751
- Don't write that.
- Too much. I should think before I type.

02:47.835 --> 02:50.796
- Okay. Well, double-click this.
- No. I've already done that, Danner.

02:50.879 --> 02:52.714
- Well, let me try. Let me try.
- No. Oh, my God.

02:52.798 --> 02:54.174
- Uh, what the…
- No, no, no.

02:54.258 --> 02:55.926
- No.
- What, what, what?

02:56.009 --> 02:58.345
- No, no.
- What button did you just push?

02:58.428 --> 03:00.055
- No.
- What button did you just push?

03:00.138 --> 03:01.974
See? You should've let me help you out.

03:02.057 --> 03:04.726
There's gotta be a backup or something.
Call the security company.

03:04.810 --> 03:07.688
It's a closed-circuit security system,
so everything is saved to exactly that.

03:07.771 --> 03:10.023
If they erase it, it's gone forever.
They screwed up.

03:10.107 --> 03:11.233
Damn it!

03:11.316 --> 03:12.776
It's the only thing exonerating me.

03:12.860 --> 03:14.403
We go on.

03:14.486 --> 03:15.737
- Did you say, "We go on?"
- No.

03:15.821 --> 03:18.198
Okay. How about this?
You get those handwriting samples.

03:18.282 --> 03:19.741
I'll take care of this. Watch this.

03:20.826 --> 03:23.328
Uh-oh. Listen,
I'm not a "I told you so" type guy,

03:23.412 --> 03:25.706
so who cares about what just happened?
I told you so.

03:25.789 --> 03:27.207
But I'm gonna help you out, okay?

03:27.291 --> 03:29.626
I knew Xavier probably better
than anybody else here,

03:29.710 --> 03:31.753
and I was with Aniq
for almost the entire night,

03:31.837 --> 03:34.214
so I can tell you details
of every second of his whereabouts.

03:34.298 --> 03:35.757
Let me go next.

03:38.010 --> 03:40.929
You know what?
You better not be wasting my time.

03:41.013 --> 03:44.057
- We're gonna just wrap you up.
- I'm telling you, you're gonna love this.

03:44.141 --> 03:45.184
I'm a storyteller…

03:49.313 --> 03:51.648
Not so adorkable anymore, huh?

03:51.732 --> 03:53.233
Did you call me adorkable?

03:54.359 --> 03:55.903
What?

04:43.909 --> 04:45.744
- Uh, get your hand off my recorder.
- You got it.

04:45.827 --> 04:47.704
- And have a seat over here.
- Over there is fine.

04:47.788 --> 04:49.039
- Thank you.
- See you in a bit.

04:50.999 --> 04:53.710
All right.
This one's gonna break me.

04:54.336 --> 04:57.506
So tell me your story.
From the beginning. The whole night.

04:57.589 --> 04:59.800
- You wanna hear it from the top?
- Yeah, from the tip-top.

04:59.883 --> 05:01.009
Okay.

05:02.386 --> 05:05.138
Mmm. Turn me up. Turn the snare up.

05:08.725 --> 05:10.978
What are you doing?
Why are you nodding your head?

05:11.061 --> 05:12.688
Feeling the beat. Give me a second.

05:34.668 --> 05:37.254
Yasper in the house! Let's go!

05:37.337 --> 05:39.464
Whoa! Okay! Ned!

05:39.548 --> 05:40.883
Hey!

05:40.966 --> 05:41.967
Oh!

05:42.050 --> 05:43.468
Yasper! Looking hot!

05:43.552 --> 05:45.387
- Chelsea! Mwah, mwah!
- Mwah, mwah!

05:45.470 --> 05:47.514
Oh!

05:47.598 --> 05:49.057
- Hey, Yasper. It's me.
- Okay.

05:49.141 --> 05:51.185
You guys wanna see me flip?
You wanna see me flip?

05:52.477 --> 05:53.729
Whoop.

05:56.148 --> 05:57.983
- Hey, Yas!
- Oh!

06:01.236 --> 06:02.446
How great is this party?

06:02.529 --> 06:03.906
- It's okay.
- Oh, no.

06:03.989 --> 06:07.367
How do I look? Have you seen Zoë?
Think this top button is too formal?

06:07.451 --> 06:09.870
You're too nervous. You're thinking
about stuff too much, okay?

06:09.953 --> 06:12.206
Tonight is a second chance for both of us.

06:12.289 --> 06:15.626
You're gonna hook up with Zoë, and
I'm gonna get Xavier to bless my track.

06:15.709 --> 06:18.253
Okay, uh, hold on a second.

06:19.213 --> 06:21.256
Oh, sorry. I forgot.
You're a civilian, right?

06:21.340 --> 06:24.301
Let me explain it to you.
Blessing a track, it works like this.

06:24.384 --> 06:28.639
A huge artist, a real famous artist,
goes on an emerging artist's track, right?

06:28.722 --> 06:30.933
It's like a musical cosign saying,
"This guy's incredible.

06:31.016 --> 06:34.269
Listen to this guy. I'm about to rap next
to this guy 'cause he's so good," right?

06:34.353 --> 06:38.232
Perfect example is 50 Cent
appeared on the Game's first track.

06:38.315 --> 06:39.816
Changed the game for the Game.

06:39.900 --> 06:43.529
Why would a big star like Xavier
wanna help you?

06:43.612 --> 06:45.864
- You're just a A/V guy.
- Xavier and I,

06:45.948 --> 06:47.908
we were in a ska band together
in high school.

06:47.991 --> 06:50.035
You should check it out.
Do you have a helmet?

06:50.118 --> 06:52.746
If you put on the helmet,
'cause it might blow your freaking mind.

06:52.829 --> 06:54.665
- It's really good.
- Mmm.

06:54.748 --> 06:57.251
But that's what it is for us, right?
We were in a band together,

06:57.334 --> 06:59.378
so we are bonded by the beat.

06:59.461 --> 07:02.965
Let's just back it up for a second.
So, you-- you show up to the party.

07:03.048 --> 07:06.718
- And you are just jumping and flipping.
- That's me, yeah.

07:06.802 --> 07:09.179
You seem a little tall
to be in gymnastics.

07:09.263 --> 07:11.265
Yeah, that's what my coach said.
But look at me now.

07:11.348 --> 07:14.351
I got, like,
40,000 participation trophies at home.

07:14.434 --> 07:16.270
And also, I was hype.
I was feeling incredible.

07:16.353 --> 07:19.648
I was feeling good, 'cause I knew
tonight was my second shot to be a star.

07:19.731 --> 07:22.359
But I also wanted to help Aniq
with his mission.

07:22.442 --> 07:25.070
I don't know. Maybe I should just forget
about the whole Zoë thing.

07:25.153 --> 07:27.406
I mean, I had my shot in high school,
and I didn't take it.

07:27.489 --> 07:29.575
What? No, no, no.
See, that's the fear talking.

07:29.658 --> 07:32.160
Now listen up close,
'cause this may sound shocking.

07:32.244 --> 07:33.662
- You about to rap?
- Yep!

10:13.989 --> 10:17.451
You know, normally,
I would want to hear every single detail.

10:17.534 --> 10:21.121
But with you, I would just love it
if you could just skip to the part

10:21.205 --> 10:23.457
where Aniq gets drunk and what happened.

10:23.540 --> 10:25.876
I can't skip ahead.
I'm telling you a story here.

10:25.959 --> 10:29.171
I'm building character arcs,
dynamics, all these things.

10:29.254 --> 10:32.633
A's, B's, whoo, whoo, whoo.
You gotta enjoy it, okay?

10:32.716 --> 10:34.635
You're gonna--
It's gonna be worth it in the end.

10:34.718 --> 10:37.554
And then you're gonna be like,
"I wish you did more of this," so…

10:38.555 --> 10:41.183
Inhale your love for the fetus

10:41.266 --> 10:44.061
and exhale the toxins.

10:44.144 --> 10:47.523
Somebody's in here.
There's a person in here.

10:47.606 --> 10:49.441
- Hi.
- Oh, uh, yeah.

10:49.525 --> 10:51.068
What is it that you're doing exactly?

10:51.151 --> 10:55.239
I'm trying to meditate to stay calm.

10:55.322 --> 10:58.575
Yeah, totally. Uh, could you write
on this piece of paper,

10:58.659 --> 11:01.245
"I have diarrhea"
or "don't have diarrhea"?

11:01.328 --> 11:06.291
I'm sorry. You interrupted
my sacred meditation for diarrhea?

11:06.375 --> 11:10.337
No. Actually, I interrupted you
for a game about diarrhea.

11:10.420 --> 11:13.423
See-- All right.
Imagine a town, all right?

11:13.507 --> 11:15.008
With villagers.

11:15.092 --> 11:16.760
With ghosts.

11:16.844 --> 11:19.346
With a barrel of clams.

11:19.429 --> 11:20.597
And one toilet.

11:20.681 --> 11:23.183
Okay, you know what? I'm gonna do it.

11:23.267 --> 11:25.769
And that way, you could probably
just leave me alone afterwards.

11:25.853 --> 11:27.437
- All right.
- Yeah. Okay.

11:27.521 --> 11:30.107
Thinking about calling it
"Spooky Dookies."

11:31.108 --> 11:33.527
- Okay. There you go.
- Thank you.

11:33.610 --> 11:36.530
All right. Whoa.
What is this? Like, the British spelling?

11:36.613 --> 11:38.866
Oh, Australian actually.

11:38.949 --> 11:41.910
Uh, my recent trip to Melbourne
is where my baby was conceived.

11:41.994 --> 11:44.705
- Yeah, that's enough. I appreciate that.
- Okay.

11:45.289 --> 11:49.001
And so the villagers are kind of just
deciding amongst themselves, like,

11:49.084 --> 11:51.253
- whether they do or don't have it.
- Aniq.

11:51.336 --> 11:54.047
Why would you think it's appropriate
to play a game right now?

11:54.131 --> 11:57.259
- And it's about diarrhea?
- Somebody say diarrhea game?

11:57.342 --> 11:58.343
Uh…

11:59.511 --> 12:01.471
- I'm in.
- Oh, okay. Uh, yeah.

12:01.555 --> 12:05.309
So you're just gonna write
whether you do or don't have diarrhea.

12:05.392 --> 12:07.811
And then you initial right there.

12:07.895 --> 12:09.855
Uh, an H in the middle. That's new.

12:09.938 --> 12:12.191
- Diarhrea!

12:12.274 --> 12:14.151
- I love this game.

12:14.234 --> 12:15.402
Yes!

12:16.737 --> 12:19.907
- Okay. I know it sounds weird.
- Yeah.

12:21.450 --> 12:24.828
So Aniq was just obsessed
with being alone with Zoë.

12:24.912 --> 12:27.748
So while he was pursuing that,
I went to find Xavier

12:27.831 --> 12:31.084
to reconnect our bond
so I can ask him to… Hit me with it!

12:31.168 --> 12:33.253
- Bless your track?
- That's it!

12:34.254 --> 12:37.007
Xavier. My God,
I didn't know you were going to be here.

12:37.090 --> 12:39.885
Yeah. No, I'm just trying to
keep a low profile tonight.

12:39.968 --> 12:42.554
- Just blend in, you know?
- But you came in on a helicopter, right?

12:42.638 --> 12:46.558
Yeah, right. But we came in real low.
Under-the-radar type of deal, you know.

12:46.642 --> 12:47.851
Ah. You, baby.

12:47.935 --> 12:49.186
- You know it.
- You know what?

12:49.269 --> 12:51.522
We gotta catch up. Say, by the bar?
I'll get you a drink.

12:52.272 --> 12:54.316
Yeah. I could use another drink.
You want one?

12:54.399 --> 12:58.111
- Mmm. I'm good, thanks.
- Okay, yeah. BRB.

12:58.195 --> 13:01.365
- Be around, baby. BRB.
- Uh, it means "be right back."

13:01.448 --> 13:02.449
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

13:02.533 --> 13:05.035
Hey, two shots.

13:08.914 --> 13:12.543
Man, we have been through
some unbelievable stuff.

13:12.626 --> 13:14.419
Unforgettable, you and me.
Can you believe it?

13:14.503 --> 13:17.214
And here we are.
The two-man band reunites.

13:17.297 --> 13:19.550
Are you talking about
Ska-pe Diem reuniting?

13:19.633 --> 13:23.220
Ska. So fucking dumb.

13:23.303 --> 13:24.805
So dumb.

13:24.888 --> 13:29.142
But also, like, I guess, super important
and dedicated to ending racism, right?

13:29.226 --> 13:31.728
I guess we weren't all that bad
for lame-ass teenagers.

13:31.812 --> 13:32.813
We had our moments.

13:32.896 --> 13:34.898
Hey, you know what? To moments.

13:34.982 --> 13:36.108
- What do you think?
- Good.

13:36.191 --> 13:37.192
Ready? Oh.

13:43.198 --> 13:45.075
- Oh!
- Whoo!

13:45.158 --> 13:47.160
- You were still going by Eugene back then.
- Oh.

13:47.244 --> 13:49.580
Do you remember?
Until I was like, "Go by your middle name.

13:49.663 --> 13:50.831
You gotta go by Xavier."

13:50.914 --> 13:53.458
- That's right. That was you.
- You're the one with the middle name.

13:53.542 --> 13:55.669
- I was just like, "Use it."
- You changed my life, man.

13:55.752 --> 13:56.753
Yes.

13:58.922 --> 14:01.425
And we're skanking till it's late!

14:01.508 --> 14:03.844
Ooh, that song was fire, man.

14:03.927 --> 14:04.928
Yeah, I know. I know.

14:05.012 --> 14:06.597
You know, I'm-- I'm-- I'm actually, uh,

14:06.680 --> 14:08.432
- making my own music right now.
- Are you?

14:08.515 --> 14:10.601
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
- Good for you, man. That's great.

14:10.684 --> 14:13.395
- Thanks.
- Whoa. Hey, where did Zoë go?

14:13.478 --> 14:15.606
Hey, actually, you know what? Um…

14:16.273 --> 14:18.859
Shit. I'm sure people ask you
this stuff all the time,

14:18.942 --> 14:21.820
but, um, man, I'd really love it
if you could bless one of my tracks.

14:22.362 --> 14:23.197
Oh.

14:23.280 --> 14:26.074
Just like an intro, or, "Here comes
Yasper," or something like that.

14:26.158 --> 14:27.743
- Something classic you.
- Yeah.

14:27.826 --> 14:29.203
It doesn't have to be a big thing.

14:29.286 --> 14:31.872
- Maybe one day.
- What about tonight at the after-party?

14:31.955 --> 14:35.918
We can go to your place, and we can just
record it in the studio that I installed.

14:36.001 --> 14:37.794
What-- What do you say?

14:37.878 --> 14:39.630
Yeah, sure. Whatever.

14:46.470 --> 14:49.389
Yeah!

15:06.406 --> 15:07.407
Here we go!

16:22.399 --> 16:24.359
These balloons can support my weight.

16:28.113 --> 16:30.449
- Whoa.

16:45.797 --> 16:47.633
Everybody, now!

16:49.927 --> 16:52.137
Uh, guys. Hey. Hey, guys?

16:57.684 --> 16:59.770
- Okay.

17:02.314 --> 17:03.565
Are we back in high school?

17:07.486 --> 17:10.030
- Yeah, sure!
- Okay, you know what?

17:13.659 --> 17:15.285
Chelsea?

17:15.368 --> 17:16.662
Just get in.

17:16.744 --> 17:18.329
Uh, that's my car.

17:18.413 --> 17:20.290
This is my car, everybody.

17:20.374 --> 17:21.875
What's happening? Hey. Hey.

17:21.959 --> 17:24.336
Those aren't keys. That's your lipstick,
and you've ruined it.

17:24.419 --> 17:29.466
Yeah, I should not-- I'm not-- It's-- Oh!

17:30.634 --> 17:33.720
And, you know, it's…
…anger, you know?

17:33.804 --> 17:36.056
And-- And Saint Patrick's Day party.

17:36.974 --> 17:38.100
He's gonna be sorry.

17:38.183 --> 17:39.768
Wait. Stop, stop. Who's gonna be sorry?

17:39.852 --> 17:41.562
- Oh.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

17:41.645 --> 17:43.689
Whoa. I gotta get to the after-party.

17:43.772 --> 17:46.483
You can't drive, all right?
How about this? I can give you a ride.

17:47.985 --> 17:50.612
Yeah, sure. Whatever.

17:56.451 --> 17:58.161
I'm touched you asked me
to play your game.

17:58.245 --> 18:01.164
Yeah. Well, everybody
is, uh, participating, so it's not--

18:01.248 --> 18:02.624
- It means a lot.
- Mm-hmm.

18:05.961 --> 18:08.130
- Sorry. Oh. Uh, Walt.
- That's enough.

18:10.090 --> 18:11.091
Oh.

18:12.009 --> 18:13.969
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:14.052 --> 18:17.514
Uh, Zoë. I'm s-sorry I was--
I was so pushy earlier.

18:17.598 --> 18:18.682
No, no, no. I'm sorry.

18:18.765 --> 18:21.935
I didn't consider this is probably
really hard for you too.

18:22.644 --> 18:27.733
And I'm worried about you.
Everyone seems to think you did it.

18:27.816 --> 18:32.279
Everyone. It's all anyone's talking about.

18:32.362 --> 18:34.907
Sorry, you're you. That's not funny.

18:35.782 --> 18:38.577
The real reason
I'm getting everybody to do this

18:38.660 --> 18:40.287
is so I can find out who killed Xavier.

18:40.370 --> 18:41.747
What?

18:41.830 --> 18:42.998
Well, it's complicated.

18:43.081 --> 18:47.920
But whoever writes "diarrhea"
the same way it's written on my neck

18:48.003 --> 18:49.338
may be the killer.

18:49.421 --> 18:51.757
Plus, I think I created
a pretty-- pretty fun game.

18:51.840 --> 18:54.551
- There's three rounds, so each tier--
- What does it look like on your neck?

18:54.635 --> 18:57.012
Uh, you know,
I'll-- I'll-- I'll show you after.

18:57.095 --> 18:58.555
Are you being serious?

18:58.639 --> 19:00.224
I don't think you could've killed anyone,

19:00.307 --> 19:02.226
let alone draw on me
when I was passed out.

19:02.309 --> 19:04.686
Well, I wouldn't be too sure…

19:05.979 --> 19:07.397
about that last part.

19:08.148 --> 19:09.233
You drew on me?

19:09.816 --> 19:11.485
What-- Well, what did you draw?

19:11.568 --> 19:13.612
Guess you'll have to find out.

19:18.909 --> 19:20.118
- You've got to wonder…
- Oh!

19:20.202 --> 19:23.288
…if she changed her handwriting
because she knew it was a test.

19:23.372 --> 19:25.666
Is that smart?

19:25.749 --> 19:27.584
It's amazing you're still here.

19:27.668 --> 19:29.169
Thank you.

19:29.253 --> 19:33.257
So we rolled into the after-party.
And I texted Xavier.

19:33.632 --> 19:36.385
What an impressive, fabulous ride, Yasper.

19:36.468 --> 19:38.220
Well, thank you very much. And it's mine.

19:38.303 --> 19:40.681
That's 100 perc-- He's texting.
He's texting back right now.

19:40.764 --> 19:43.851
Oh, I hate this perfectly beautiful,
amazing house.

19:43.934 --> 19:46.520
He's still texting. Still texting.
Do you guys see Xavier anywhere?

19:46.603 --> 19:48.313
Uh, Xavier Schmavier.

19:48.397 --> 19:49.398
Still texting.

19:50.190 --> 19:53.068
Maybe he's probably thinking
about the perfect way to bless my track.

19:53.151 --> 19:55.946
Hey, buddy. If you need it,
I'll bless your track, 'kay?

20:00.993 --> 20:02.578
Why is this taking so long?

20:02.661 --> 20:05.247
Yes. Yasper. How's it going, man?

20:05.330 --> 20:06.748
I don't know yet.

21:12.981 --> 21:16.985
Come on, man. Just one text. Please.

21:50.727 --> 21:51.895
Aniq.

21:51.979 --> 21:53.981
I mean, it's just a dress.

21:54.064 --> 21:55.357
Just a dress? Nah, nah.

21:55.440 --> 21:58.652
That's a statement
with an exclamation point.

21:58.735 --> 22:00.279
- Yeah?
- Yeah. You know it.

22:01.947 --> 22:02.948
What's up, man?

22:03.031 --> 22:04.032
- Hey, Brett.
- Yeah.

22:05.534 --> 22:09.037
- Brett? What the hell?
- Whoops.

22:09.121 --> 22:10.455
Are you okay?

22:10.539 --> 22:11.915
Oh, I'm aces, baby.

22:11.999 --> 22:14.459
- You're very drunk. Aniq. Aniq.
- You're so talented.

22:18.088 --> 22:21.967
Hey, Xavier. Xavier.
I'm still waiting for that text.

22:25.387 --> 22:27.764
- Remember me, bro?
- I remember, bitch.

22:27.848 --> 22:30.017
- Oh, I remember you.
- Oh, yeah? What do you remember?

22:30.100 --> 22:31.351
It's all falling apart.

22:31.935 --> 22:33.854
Flaming Jell-O shots!

22:33.937 --> 22:36.815
- No. No, no, no, no, no, no. No. No.
- Oh, that's terrible.

22:36.899 --> 22:37.900
- No, no.
- One more.

22:37.983 --> 22:39.693
No, that's a candle. That's a candle.

22:39.776 --> 22:41.361
- You're a candle.
- Whoops, here you go.

22:41.445 --> 22:42.988
- Oh, thank you.
- Thank you.

23:26.240 --> 23:30.536
Two verses, three choruses,
one bridge and a broken heart.

23:30.619 --> 23:34.248
What? Did you see anything else?
Did you see what happened?

23:34.331 --> 23:36.041
I was lost in 4/4 time.

23:36.625 --> 23:41.421
But-- But when I did see Aniq,
I came to his rescue again.

23:42.673 --> 23:44.383
Could you close your legs, please?

23:46.176 --> 23:47.386
Thank you.

23:52.766 --> 23:56.270
I'm so pumped I brought my pranking pen.

23:56.353 --> 23:57.563
Ned, what is wrong with you?

23:57.646 --> 24:00.315
- That's not funny. Get off of him.
- It's pranks. I put a mustache--

24:00.399 --> 24:02.693
- It's very original.
- Why is that funny? It's a mustache.

24:02.776 --> 24:05.195
It's not funny now. It'll be funny
when he wakes up.

24:05.279 --> 24:08.031
Aniq, you okay, buddy? Can you hear me?

24:08.115 --> 24:10.409
What happened with your pants?
How is that even possible?

24:10.492 --> 24:13.412
By the way, the mustache looks good.
A little Lando.

24:13.495 --> 24:14.955
I'm gonna get you some pants, okay?

24:20.711 --> 24:22.296
Could be me one day.

24:26.008 --> 24:29.386
Oh, Mr. Shapiro! What's going on, dude?
I didn't know you were gonna--

24:29.469 --> 24:33.098
It's a bad time. It's a bad time?
Okay. Oh. Hi, Heather.

24:34.766 --> 24:38.061
A hero has come. Yeah,
now your penis won't be out to the world.

24:38.145 --> 24:39.688
Do you know what I mean? Listen to me.

24:39.771 --> 24:41.481
- I will always be by your side.

24:41.565 --> 24:44.359
No matter what happens, I'm here for you.
We've been through so much--

24:44.943 --> 24:49.239
Oh, baby! It's back on, baby! Let's go!

24:49.323 --> 24:51.033
You ready for a hit track, Zoë?

24:51.116 --> 24:54.411
Whoo! All for one and fuck 'em all!

24:54.494 --> 24:56.997
What a twist! What happened?

24:57.080 --> 25:00.292
- Chels, ready for some music magic?
- Nah. I think I'm gonna go home.

25:00.375 --> 25:03.712
No, you can't. There's gonna be
a listening party. What's wrong? Tell me.

25:03.795 --> 25:06.048
I was gonna do a thing tonight,
and it didn't work out.

25:06.131 --> 25:08.300
Can I tell you something
that is gonna blow your brains?

25:08.383 --> 25:12.221
I'm about to record a track with Xavier.
It's the first time since Ska-pe Diem.

25:12.304 --> 25:16.141
Ska-pe Diem, the premier East Bay Area
high school ska band from the mid-2000s?

25:16.225 --> 25:19.269
Oh, my God. You know all about us
because we were incredible in high school.

25:19.353 --> 25:22.272
Yeah, my head exploded off my body,
and I had no head for a week.

25:22.356 --> 25:25.651
That's not the point, I'm so sorry.
The point is, take your shot now.

25:25.734 --> 25:29.154
It is never too late to ska-pe diem.
Do you understand what I'm saying?

25:29.238 --> 25:32.032
I'm living proof. Look at this.
From this side now. And this.

25:32.115 --> 25:34.743
You are the most inspiring individual
I've ever met.

25:34.826 --> 25:37.871
- Thank you, Yasper.
- What a great conversation. Thank you.

25:37.955 --> 25:40.165
Wait, wait, wait. Hold up, hold up.
This is serious, okay?

25:40.249 --> 25:41.875
Does everybody know what time it is?

25:42.626 --> 25:45.796
- It's time to party.

25:50.968 --> 25:53.679
Oh, okay. She's going over there too.
I guess her thing involves him.

25:53.762 --> 25:55.764
That's cool. Oh.

25:55.848 --> 25:58.892
Bringing him over here.
My man, to the recording studio.

25:58.976 --> 26:01.603
It is time for us to--
Okay, they're going up there.

26:02.437 --> 26:04.815
It's this way. Ah, X. Okay, you know what?

26:04.898 --> 26:07.568
I'll see you in the recording studio
in ten minutes. Not a big deal.

26:07.651 --> 26:09.027
Take your time. Don't rush.

26:09.111 --> 26:11.405
Good for her. That's fine.
I can wait it out. No problem.

26:11.488 --> 26:13.866
In the meantime, though…

26:15.909 --> 26:20.205
Obviously, I had to take a selfie
to memorialize the historic moment.

26:21.081 --> 26:23.667
- What, this thing?

26:23.750 --> 26:25.127
That's good.

26:26.295 --> 26:31.341
Xavier's text said Track 12 in the Work in
Progress folder would work for our collab.

26:31.425 --> 26:32.509
So I opened it up.

26:50.360 --> 26:56.283
Ooh! No! No!
How great is this party?

26:56.366 --> 26:59.077
- I don't get it. What's so funny?

26:59.161 --> 27:01.121
You may wanna write this down
to remember it later,

27:01.205 --> 27:02.748
so you can talk about it yourself.

27:02.831 --> 27:07.169
So, right when Xavier and I transitioned
from Sublime covers to originals,

27:07.252 --> 27:10.088
I came up
with the perfect musical philosophy.

27:10.172 --> 27:14.009
- The four categories of songs.
- Please do not list them.

27:14.092 --> 27:19.139
Category one: "I love you, or I hate you,
but I secretly love you."

27:19.223 --> 27:21.767
- Okay, those I like.
- Right?

27:21.850 --> 27:23.393
- That's a great type of song.
- Uh-huh.

27:23.477 --> 27:26.146
"I'm so great,"
or "My hometown's so great."

27:26.230 --> 27:29.775
Category three: "Come on, everybody.
Listen up, this is important."

27:29.858 --> 27:32.069
See, those are your issues songs.
Those are your Bono's,

27:32.152 --> 27:34.279
- your Macklemore's, know what I'm saying?
- Mm-hmm.

27:34.363 --> 27:36.907
People that have something to say.
To give something to society.

27:36.990 --> 27:40.118
And then number four…
Drumroll, please. Hit me with a drumroll.

27:40.202 --> 27:43.247
You're not doing it.
Hit me with a drumroll. I'll do it.

27:43.330 --> 27:45.082
Do it with me.
You don't have to. That's fine.

27:45.165 --> 27:48.085
Number four: "How great is this party?"

27:48.168 --> 27:51.588
That's the party anthem, because every
single time Xavier and I played together,

27:51.672 --> 27:55.509
I would grab the microphone and yell,
"How great is this party?"

27:55.592 --> 27:56.844
And people would go nuts.

27:56.927 --> 27:59.221
That's why Xavier said that I inspired it.

27:59.304 --> 28:01.765
Wow. Congratulations, man.

28:01.849 --> 28:04.893
It sounds like to me you got one rosebush

28:04.977 --> 28:08.146
just growing on a big ol' pile of shit.

28:08.230 --> 28:10.190
From you, it means so much.
Thank you very much.

28:10.274 --> 28:12.985
- So, Xav's track was good,

28:13.068 --> 28:15.362
but it lacked hype. The secret ingredient.

28:15.445 --> 28:19.908
Luckily, I had the perfect source.
Our MLK Day concert.

28:19.992 --> 28:22.286
How great is this party?

28:22.369 --> 28:24.705
So I sampled the audio of myself shouting…

28:24.788 --> 28:27.082
"How great is this party?"

28:27.165 --> 28:28.542
…and put it on the track.

28:29.168 --> 28:31.336
How great is this party?

28:33.922 --> 28:34.923
In the back now.

28:41.221 --> 28:43.140
But nine minutes had already gone by,

28:43.223 --> 28:44.933
and Xav still wasn't done with Chelsea.

28:45.017 --> 28:46.018
I couldn't risk it.

28:47.769 --> 28:49.646
So I ideated an idea.

28:56.653 --> 28:59.823
How great is this party? Five, six, seven…

29:01.617 --> 29:03.160
What on earth?

29:06.121 --> 29:07.122
Solo!

29:07.206 --> 29:09.124
- Hey.
- Oh, my God.

29:09.208 --> 29:11.293
- What happened to me?
- Wait a second. Are you okay?

29:11.376 --> 29:13.587
- Are you all right?
- Who did this to me?

29:14.963 --> 29:17.382
- It was Xavier, wasn't it?
- I really don't think it was Xavier.

29:17.466 --> 29:20.052
Don't worry. I'm not gonna, like,
freak out or anything, you know?

29:20.135 --> 29:21.303
I'm not gonna, like, hurt him.

29:21.386 --> 29:22.804
- Could you imagine?
- No.

29:22.888 --> 29:26.308
I'm just gonna explain to Xavier
that his pranks aren't okay.

29:26.391 --> 29:28.018
They weren't in high school,

29:28.101 --> 29:29.603
- and they're not now. All right?
- Aniq.

29:30.187 --> 29:31.605
- I'll be right back, okay?
- Okay.

29:31.688 --> 29:34.441
If you see him, could you tell him
to meet me in the recording studio?

29:34.525 --> 29:35.567
One, two…

29:44.201 --> 29:47.162
- Oh!
- That's when I heard the scream.

29:47.246 --> 29:49.540
Can I see the text messages
you were talking about?

29:49.623 --> 29:53.836
Of course. I mean, these could be
the very last words he ever texted.

29:53.919 --> 29:58.674
Um, "Track 12 in WIP folder
should work for our collab.

29:58.757 --> 30:00.050
You inspired it.

30:00.717 --> 30:03.011
Be there in-- Be there in ten minutes."

30:03.637 --> 30:06.223
This definitely narrows down
the time of death.

30:07.724 --> 30:08.851
There you go.

30:11.228 --> 30:13.564
I was so close to my dreams.

30:14.565 --> 30:18.443
And-- And now they're gone.
And so is Xavier.

30:18.527 --> 30:20.946
You know what?
I understand what you're going through.

30:21.029 --> 30:22.823
You've got dreams. You're a hustler.

30:22.906 --> 30:24.533
We're both alike in a lot of ways.

30:25.534 --> 30:26.535
Are you hitting on me?

30:26.618 --> 30:27.953
Hell no.

30:33.333 --> 30:36.170
Often. Stress.

30:37.254 --> 30:39.339
And I know how to spell it, by the way.

30:40.757 --> 30:44.761
Besides, I've never had it before.
My stools are rock-hard. Always.

30:44.845 --> 30:46.513
Oh. Cool.

30:46.597 --> 30:47.681
- Healthy.
- Okay.

30:52.352 --> 30:54.479
Hey, Chelsea. How's it going?

30:54.563 --> 30:56.315
Hey, Aniq.

30:58.483 --> 31:00.944
You can come closer. I'm-- I'm not crazy.

31:01.028 --> 31:03.405
No, I know. Yeah. Here I come.

31:04.448 --> 31:05.449
Ooh. Hey, Chelsea.

31:05.532 --> 31:06.700
- Uh…
- That's better.

31:06.783 --> 31:09.870
So, a bunch of us are playing
this fun game where you--

31:09.953 --> 31:14.416
Kind of, you-- you write down,
like, a-- a sentence.

31:14.499 --> 31:17.294
That's the game? You write a sentence?

31:17.377 --> 31:18.629
There's three rounds to it,

31:18.712 --> 31:22.090
and so in the first round, uh,
it's-- it's called the villager round,

31:22.174 --> 31:24.218
so everybody's a villager,
so everybody writes down--

31:24.301 --> 31:27.137
You know, I just… I-- I don't
really feel like playing any games.

31:27.221 --> 31:31.558
Well, the only way the game works
is if everybody kind of plays,

31:31.642 --> 31:34.061
and you're the only one
who hasn't done it.

31:34.144 --> 31:35.646
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. I'm pretty sure.

31:35.729 --> 31:40.108
I got Ned, I got-- I got Brett,
I got Jenn 1, I…

31:48.408 --> 31:49.618
Oh, my God.

31:51.787 --> 31:53.205
Hey, can I say one more thing?

31:53.288 --> 31:55.499
There's no way Aniq could have done this.

31:55.582 --> 31:58.335
I'm telling you, the last person
to have seen Xavier was Chelsea, right?

31:58.418 --> 31:59.920
They were in the room together.

32:00.003 --> 32:03.674
And I can't speak on her mental state,
but I can speak to Aniq's, and he's just--

32:03.757 --> 32:07.553
He's too good of a guy.
He's like a real kind human being.

32:07.636 --> 32:12.057
His heart is made of cotton candy
and gummy bears and jollies

32:12.140 --> 32:15.185
that you just want to pop into your mouth
and go…

32:15.686 --> 32:17.980
I am glad that we are done here.

32:18.063 --> 32:19.356
Jenn 1.

32:19.439 --> 32:20.941
- Exhale the toxins.
- I'm calm.

32:21.024 --> 32:22.150
I'm not raising my voice.

32:22.234 --> 32:26.864
I am inviting you to stop barging in on me
like a giant asshole.

32:26.947 --> 32:28.282
Yeah. This-- This is important.

32:31.243 --> 32:32.452
Oh! Detective Danner?

32:32.536 --> 32:34.204
I crushed it. She loved my--

32:34.288 --> 32:36.164
My BFF, Jennifer 2…

32:36.248 --> 32:37.291
What about her?

32:37.374 --> 32:38.417
She's missing.

32:38.500 --> 32:41.086
She was here when I woke up,
and now she's not.

32:41.170 --> 32:44.798
Yeah. And she's nowhere in the house.
I keep calling and calling.

32:44.882 --> 32:48.594
There's a chance we may have
a second victim on our hands.

32:48.677 --> 32:52.014
Okay, Angela Lansbury.
This is our case. So…

32:52.097 --> 32:53.640
No. You know what? He might be right.

32:53.724 --> 32:56.226
Why don't you recheck every room
in the house and outside?

32:56.310 --> 32:58.645
Absolutely. Fuck you.

32:59.354 --> 33:01.982
- Detective, you said outside?
- Mm-hmm.

33:02.065 --> 33:05.652
That has to be your number one priority.
She will not fare well in the wild.

33:05.736 --> 33:09.823
Wait a second. Who could possibly
have it out for Jennifer 2?

33:09.907 --> 33:11.992
- I don't know.
- Detective.

33:12.075 --> 33:14.494
We found something wedged
between the rocks near Xavier's body.

33:14.578 --> 33:16.997
Is it Jennifer 2? It's Jennifer 2. I know.

33:17.080 --> 33:19.917
I knew it. She's dead. Oh.

33:20.000 --> 33:21.084
Chelsea.

33:25.214 --> 33:28.217
Yeah. It's mine.
