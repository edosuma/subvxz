WEBVTT

00:02.670 --> 00:04.138
Previously on Empire...
Baby, come back in.

00:04.172 --> 00:05.139
Get up out my house!

00:05.173 --> 00:06.507
COOKIE:
You still with Anika?

00:06.540 --> 00:07.641
I was never with Anika.

00:07.675 --> 00:09.310
You feeling me?
No!

00:09.343 --> 00:11.812
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to
come on to you. You forgive me?

00:11.845 --> 00:13.914
Meet your new
Gutter Life president,

00:13.947 --> 00:15.916
Mr. Andre Lyon!
(cheering)

00:15.949 --> 00:16.984
PRYCE:
He's testing you.

00:17.017 --> 00:18.686
I baptize you in the name

00:18.719 --> 00:19.820
of the Father and the Son.

00:19.853 --> 00:21.855
Amen!

00:21.889 --> 00:23.591
You got something and it
don't come around every day.

00:23.624 --> 00:25.226
Let me help you do
something with it.

00:25.259 --> 00:27.528
You are the fifth
promoter I met with.

00:27.561 --> 00:29.163
I'm not afraid
to get my hands dirty.

00:29.197 --> 00:30.564
Drop it, bitch!

00:30.598 --> 00:33.167
Who sent you?
Thirsty!

00:33.201 --> 00:34.202
Quit trying
to steal our tracks.

00:34.235 --> 00:35.336
Cookie and Lucious got beef,

00:35.369 --> 00:36.737
but that ain't got
nothing to do with you.

00:36.770 --> 00:38.206
You need her.

00:38.239 --> 00:39.273
More importantly,
she loves you.

00:39.307 --> 00:40.574
Welcome to Lyon Dynasty.

00:40.608 --> 00:41.709
You want to chillax here,

00:41.742 --> 00:43.010
you gonna pay tax here.

00:43.043 --> 00:44.212
What is this?!

00:44.245 --> 00:44.978
(tires screech)

00:46.046 --> 00:48.449
*

00:48.482 --> 00:50.684
A'ight, let's go!
Let's go!

00:50.718 --> 00:52.686
Where y'all taking me?!
Get his punk ass out.

00:52.720 --> 00:53.921
Get off me!
Hurry up!

00:53.954 --> 00:56.124
Get off me!
Shut up!

00:59.927 --> 01:01.929
Damn, you put it on me, girl.

01:01.962 --> 01:04.465
(Becky laughs)

01:04.498 --> 01:06.567
You put it on me.

01:06.600 --> 01:07.701
I know.

01:07.735 --> 01:10.138
(laughs)

01:10.171 --> 01:13.574
I got to get some sleep
before work.

01:13.607 --> 01:15.376
Well, we ain't slept yet.

01:15.409 --> 01:17.878
I want to stay up here with you
all day, but, um,

01:17.911 --> 01:18.946
I got to go.

01:18.979 --> 01:20.481
I got to go to work early

01:20.514 --> 01:22.916
and prepare for my meeting
with my new boss Andre.

01:22.950 --> 01:25.453
You could be a few minutes late.

01:25.486 --> 01:27.621
I can't be a second late.
(chuckles)

01:27.655 --> 01:30.424
Oh, you keep that leg right
there, you gonna end up late.

01:30.458 --> 01:32.560
Mm, no.

01:32.593 --> 01:34.061
I should go.

01:34.094 --> 01:36.130
You got this, baby.

01:36.164 --> 01:39.267
Can't no man knock you off
of your game.

01:39.300 --> 01:41.235
No man?
Not unless his name

01:41.269 --> 01:43.271
is J Poppa.
Oh, who's that?

01:43.304 --> 01:46.474
Keem, this is my fifth time
calling you. (chuckles)

01:46.507 --> 01:48.276
Now, you better
not be ducking me.

01:48.309 --> 01:51.812
Laz got you the headline spot
for the Big Apple Jam.

01:51.845 --> 01:53.947
Okay, that's big, Keem;
that's big for you

01:53.981 --> 01:55.649
and the Lyon Dynasty.

01:55.683 --> 01:58.619
So you need to get your ass
down here to rehearse.

01:58.652 --> 02:01.922
I got Destiny's Problem Child
looking for their lead man,

02:01.955 --> 02:06.427
so if that's still you,
I suggest you hit me back ASAP!

02:06.460 --> 02:10.264
(sighs) You wonder why Gladys
ever had the Pips, right?

02:10.298 --> 02:11.365
(laughs)
Who?

02:11.399 --> 02:12.766
Seriously?

02:12.800 --> 02:14.335
Y'all need to stay off
y'all's cell phones

02:14.368 --> 02:16.003
and quit all that
Tinderoni and Grinding,

02:16.036 --> 02:17.438
and learn some history...

02:17.471 --> 02:18.606
Porsha? Porsha?

02:18.639 --> 02:20.107
Shut up, please. Thank you.

02:20.140 --> 02:21.842
Okay, until Hakeem
gets here,

02:21.875 --> 02:23.010
ladies, we need to run the song.

02:23.043 --> 02:24.111
We need to work on the song.

02:24.144 --> 02:25.112
So, Laura, take it
from the top. Porsha...

02:25.145 --> 02:26.480
The top of what, Cookie?

02:26.514 --> 02:28.382
We already did the intro,
the chorus.

02:28.416 --> 02:30.117
Hakeem comes in right after.

02:30.150 --> 02:32.220
Right, okay.

02:32.253 --> 02:33.554
Excuse me for a second.

02:33.587 --> 02:35.656
Just, uh...

02:35.689 --> 02:37.691
Hakeem Lyon,

02:37.725 --> 02:40.994
get your black ass down here.

02:41.028 --> 02:43.197
Well, okay, Miss Thing.

02:43.231 --> 02:46.066
Since you already know
the choreography, let me see it.

02:46.099 --> 02:47.368
Okay.

02:47.401 --> 02:49.837
*
Three, four, five, six...

02:49.870 --> 02:52.206
Hey, Cookie, you should
let me spit Hakeem verse.

02:52.240 --> 02:53.974
You know, just to get them
into it. I got skills.

02:54.007 --> 02:55.543
No, you don't.
I do.

02:55.576 --> 02:57.545
No, you don't.
And you need to stop asking.

02:57.578 --> 03:00.648
'Cause in a minute, you gonna
be asking for a new job

03:00.681 --> 03:02.015
somewhere else, see,
'cause I should've

03:02.049 --> 03:04.051
fired your dumb ass,
like, ten times alre...

03:04.084 --> 03:05.185
(phone rings)
See, wait.

03:05.219 --> 03:06.354
Finally.

03:06.387 --> 03:07.988
Yes.
(laughs)

03:08.021 --> 03:10.023
What the hell?

03:13.561 --> 03:16.497
No, that's not real.

03:16.530 --> 03:18.098
It's Lucious.

03:18.131 --> 03:20.133
(piano playing gentle melody)

03:31.044 --> 03:34.114
* Delta John to Alpha 1

03:34.147 --> 03:37.217
* Said my systems checkin'

03:37.251 --> 03:39.553
* Something's going on

03:39.587 --> 03:41.289
* What to do

03:41.322 --> 03:44.458
* Are you coming through?

03:44.492 --> 03:48.696
* Delta John to Alpha 1

03:48.729 --> 03:51.599
* Said my systems crashed

03:51.632 --> 03:54.268
* And something's come undone

03:54.302 --> 03:57.971
* 911, copy, copy you

03:59.973 --> 04:03.243
* Delta John to Alpha 1

04:03.277 --> 04:06.580
* Said my system check is done

04:06.614 --> 04:09.883
* Know the rules
of how to play *

04:09.917 --> 04:12.052
* Learn the truth,
it happened today *

04:12.085 --> 04:14.788
* 'Cause you won't love

04:14.822 --> 04:16.724
* And he can't leave

04:16.757 --> 04:19.960
* You can't fight
the urge to cheat *

04:19.993 --> 04:22.496
* You just hide awake, alone

04:22.530 --> 04:27.000
* Till the night
and days are gone *

04:27.034 --> 04:28.402
* So be good

04:28.436 --> 04:30.137
* Fair thee well

04:30.170 --> 04:31.839
* Follow through

04:31.872 --> 04:33.674
* Move on

04:33.707 --> 04:35.443
* Mon'ami, mon'ami

04:35.476 --> 04:36.977
* You be true, you be true

04:37.010 --> 04:38.679
* And I'll try

04:38.712 --> 04:41.181
* Be strong but you won't love

04:41.214 --> 04:43.584
* The way you should

04:43.617 --> 04:46.754
* Sometimes love
can make it good *

04:46.787 --> 04:50.791
* If you're listening

04:50.824 --> 04:53.026
* Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh...

04:53.060 --> 04:55.195
* But you hurt love.

04:55.228 --> 04:56.830
Yo, I'm sorry.
Stop for one second.

04:56.864 --> 04:59.266
Oh, come on.
You were killing it, man!

04:59.299 --> 05:00.501
I'm sorry, my head
just ain't in this.

05:00.534 --> 05:02.202
Okay, then where is it?
What's wrong?

05:02.235 --> 05:04.104
For one, you know the Staples
Center didn't hit me back.

05:04.137 --> 05:06.106
Wait, hold on, hold on.
Hey, hey!

05:06.139 --> 05:08.275
Give me a, give me a minute.
Give me a minute.

05:08.308 --> 05:09.510
Take a break.

05:09.543 --> 05:11.512
Question is:
is it in your head

05:11.545 --> 05:13.347
or is it in your heart?

05:13.381 --> 05:16.049
I don't know, man, I just...

05:16.083 --> 05:18.218
I'm so disgusted with myself
since Michael cheated.

05:18.251 --> 05:21.455
Fidelity ain't...
everybody ain't made for it.

05:21.489 --> 05:22.890
Yeah, but that's past shady.

05:22.923 --> 05:24.492
He up on my balcony with his
little thing hanging out...

05:24.525 --> 05:26.860
No, no, no, I don't need to know
the details, I don't need...

05:26.894 --> 05:28.896
All you need to know
is that the Staples Center,

05:28.929 --> 05:30.364
there's no way
they gonna pass on you.

05:30.398 --> 05:32.332
And regarding Michael,

05:32.366 --> 05:35.068
you got to put that
into the music, man.

05:36.537 --> 05:37.805
Come on.

05:37.838 --> 05:39.707
Engineer?

05:43.210 --> 05:45.613
(piano playing)

05:48.882 --> 05:52.753
* Made the choice
to play the field *

05:52.786 --> 05:56.089
* But you got nervous
and high at the wheel *

05:56.123 --> 05:57.991
* You like to voice...

05:58.025 --> 05:59.660
Now I knew there was
some low-ass levels

05:59.693 --> 06:01.562
you would go to, Lucious.
I am working!

06:01.595 --> 06:04.264
But this, this is
some otherworld lowness.

06:04.297 --> 06:07.034
Look what he had done
to your brother.

06:07.067 --> 06:08.068
What?

06:08.101 --> 06:10.771
I didn't do this.

06:10.804 --> 06:12.406
This ain't me, Cookie.

06:12.440 --> 06:14.575
Oh, my God.

06:14.608 --> 06:16.043
They really snatched him.

06:16.076 --> 06:18.579
Wait, wait, wait.

06:18.612 --> 06:20.781
Oh, baby, damn!

06:20.814 --> 06:23.016
I know what this is.
I know what this is.

06:23.050 --> 06:24.184
Come on, come with me.

06:24.217 --> 06:25.285
Yeah, I'm coming, too.

06:25.318 --> 06:26.286
No!

06:26.319 --> 06:27.421
The further away
from this for you,

06:27.455 --> 06:29.089
the better.
They will take you, too.

06:29.122 --> 06:30.390
Are you kidding me?
I'm coming!

06:30.424 --> 06:32.860
No!
You're gonna stay right here.

06:32.893 --> 06:34.728
Get your ass down, man!

06:34.762 --> 06:36.730
We should've taken
the more famous brother.

06:36.764 --> 06:37.765
The one with talent.

06:37.798 --> 06:39.600
This one here
is probably worth 50 cents

06:39.633 --> 06:41.735
on Jamal Lyon's dollar.

06:55.916 --> 06:57.585
What, y'all some cowboys?

06:58.952 --> 07:01.655
What, y'all a bunch
of punk-ass cowboys?!

07:02.422 --> 07:04.625
Well, my name Hakeem...

07:04.658 --> 07:05.859
(groans)

07:07.795 --> 07:09.396
What was that, you little bitch?

07:09.429 --> 07:10.831
Huh? Huh?!

07:19.172 --> 07:22.175
(Lucious sighs)

07:22.209 --> 07:24.244
Yeah, we gonna get
him back okay.

07:24.277 --> 07:26.580
How do you know?
How do you know, Lucious?

07:26.614 --> 07:29.483
Because they only
asked for $40,000.

07:29.517 --> 07:30.951
If this was
some long-term

07:30.984 --> 07:32.986
or they gonna hurt
him or kill him...

07:33.020 --> 07:34.855
Don't say that!
Don't say that!

07:34.888 --> 07:36.757
I'm just saying,
it's a simple snatch-and-grab.

07:36.790 --> 07:38.659
"Snatch-and-grab"?
Really, Lucious?

07:38.692 --> 07:40.594
You know where we come from,
ain't no such thing

07:40.628 --> 07:42.095
as no snatch-and-grab;
they snatch your ass,

07:42.129 --> 07:43.263
it's a wrap.

07:43.296 --> 07:44.364
Yeah, well,
things done changed.

07:44.397 --> 07:46.767
Nobody gets
bodied these days.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.135
You know, this is just

07:48.168 --> 07:50.604
somebody trying to
do a simple hustle

07:50.638 --> 07:51.639
and they flexing on you.

07:51.672 --> 07:53.507
Flexing on me?
Why me?!

07:53.541 --> 07:55.275
Because you're a
rookie to the block

07:55.308 --> 07:57.110
and they want
to remind you.

07:57.144 --> 07:59.880
Look, don't forget, they know
that you're my baby mama

07:59.913 --> 08:02.149
and they know that
he's related to me,

08:02.182 --> 08:03.784
so whatever happens,

08:03.817 --> 08:05.786
we're gonna get our
boy back, I swear.

08:05.819 --> 08:07.187
(cell phone ringing)

08:07.220 --> 08:09.557
Okay.
Go ahead.
That's them.

08:09.590 --> 08:11.825
Hello?

08:11.859 --> 08:14.361
Yep, we got the money.

08:14.394 --> 08:15.963
We at the drop-off!

08:15.996 --> 08:18.198
No, no, hold on,
hold on, hold on.

08:18.231 --> 08:19.867
Look, before we go any further,

08:19.900 --> 08:21.501
I want to know that
there's proof of life.

08:21.535 --> 08:23.671
Proof...?
Proof that he's okay.

08:23.704 --> 08:25.405
(whispers):
Proof of life?!

08:28.341 --> 08:30.477
Lucious and Cookie Lyon,
I'm still alive.

08:30.510 --> 08:33.881
This video is proof of life.

08:33.914 --> 08:36.149
I'm still here.

08:36.183 --> 08:38.018
Yeah, I see it.

08:38.051 --> 08:40.588
We're good, so...
where do you want it?

08:40.621 --> 08:42.322
Yeah, I see the
welding spot.

08:42.355 --> 08:43.323
All right.

08:43.356 --> 08:45.225
All right, thank you.

08:45.258 --> 08:46.359
What was that, Lucious?

08:46.393 --> 08:47.394
We're good to go.
Uh-huh.

08:47.427 --> 08:48.596
What was that?

08:48.629 --> 08:50.030
You said this was
just a snatch-and-grab.

08:50.063 --> 08:51.431
What is "proof of life"?

08:51.464 --> 08:53.601
Th-There's always
variables.

08:53.634 --> 08:55.402
Look, it's a different
time now, baby.

08:55.435 --> 08:57.204
Just stay calm.

08:57.237 --> 09:00.107
They said they gonna drop him
about three blocks west of here.

09:00.140 --> 09:02.542
This is the drop
spot for them.

09:02.576 --> 09:05.378
As we start rebranding Gutter
Life with me as president,

09:05.412 --> 09:07.080
I'd like to get
to know our roster.

09:07.114 --> 09:08.415
We listed all the artists,

09:08.448 --> 09:10.250
the tickets sales,
digital downloads,

09:10.283 --> 09:12.953
tour grosses
and the algorithms.

09:12.986 --> 09:14.722
Mathematically, you can see
where our artists rank

09:14.755 --> 09:17.557
against other independent
labels of the same size.

09:17.591 --> 09:19.226
I already know the numbers.

09:19.259 --> 09:21.862
But that's not where it starts.

09:21.895 --> 09:23.697
Is it, Becky?

09:23.731 --> 09:25.465
Of course not.

09:25.498 --> 09:28.869
It starts with talent and drive
and having something...

09:28.902 --> 09:30.137
You don't have to recite
what you learned

09:30.170 --> 09:31.639
from your Empire intern manual.
Not here for that.

09:31.672 --> 09:33.373
This all has to
mean something,

09:33.406 --> 09:34.808
ladies and gentlemen.

09:34.842 --> 09:36.644
Now, what if we based our roster

09:36.677 --> 09:38.578
on the wealth
of an individual's character,

09:38.612 --> 09:40.580
as well as their bottom line?

09:40.614 --> 09:43.150
Becky,

09:43.183 --> 09:45.218
can you set up a meeting for me
with each of these artists?

09:45.252 --> 09:48.789
I'd like to get them to know
before I start pruning the tree.

09:48.822 --> 09:49.990
Of course.

09:50.023 --> 09:51.524
If they're not
up to standard...

09:53.193 --> 09:55.295
...the new standard
of Gutter Life,

09:55.328 --> 09:56.764
we have to drop them.

10:07.507 --> 10:10.410
Don't make any sudden moves
when the drop-off car gets here.

10:10.443 --> 10:13.180
Okay.
Okay? Just stay calm.

10:13.213 --> 10:14.481
Okay, here they go.
Okay.

10:14.514 --> 10:16.583
Now, this is on their terms,
let them make the release.

10:16.616 --> 10:19.119
All right, all right.

10:19.152 --> 10:21.154
Cookie!
No.

10:22.189 --> 10:23.857
He's not here!

10:23.891 --> 10:25.592
Lucious, Hakeem not here!
Hey, baby...

10:25.625 --> 10:26.860
Hey, get your ass out!

10:26.894 --> 10:28.028
Hey! Hey, man!

10:28.061 --> 10:29.029
Hey, man,
where my son?!

10:29.062 --> 10:30.130
Where's my son?

10:30.163 --> 10:31.498
Hey, man, I don't
know your son, man!

10:31.531 --> 10:33.033
Look, homeboy
asked to be let out.

10:33.066 --> 10:34.201
And you let him out?!

10:34.234 --> 10:36.636
Listen, two dudes paid me a G
to drive this van.

10:36.670 --> 10:37.805
What did they look like?

10:37.838 --> 10:39.272
I-I don't know.

10:39.306 --> 10:40.874
What?
What? Uh-uh!
Shake him...

10:40.908 --> 10:42.976
Please! Please! Please!

10:44.211 --> 10:46.113
They gave me a phone, all right?

10:46.146 --> 10:48.015
And directions...
I swear, that's all.

10:48.048 --> 10:49.717
COOKIE:
Shut up, bitch!

10:49.750 --> 10:51.218
Where did our
son go, Lucious?

10:51.251 --> 10:53.120
Where's Hakeem?

10:53.153 --> 10:55.122
(siren wailing in distance)

10:55.155 --> 10:56.656
*

11:03.596 --> 11:04.631
Mama, stop.

11:04.664 --> 11:06.533
Stop, stop, stop talking about

11:06.566 --> 11:08.736
how everything's gonna be fine,

11:08.769 --> 11:11.404
how I'm gonna be okay,
because clearly I'm not.

11:11.438 --> 11:13.473
No, I have nothing!

11:13.506 --> 11:14.708
I have no one.

11:15.743 --> 11:17.444
Good-bye, Mom.

11:20.547 --> 11:21.481
Hakeem,
what are you...?

11:21.514 --> 11:23.450
What are you doing?

11:26.887 --> 11:28.688
(panting)

11:37.264 --> 11:40.667
*

11:40.700 --> 11:42.669
Look, Keem, I know you mad,
but we're trying to help.

11:42.702 --> 11:45.105
We can't do that
if you don't let us in.

11:45.138 --> 11:47.240
I understand you've been
through an ordeal, Hakeem,

11:47.274 --> 11:48.241
and I'm just gonna
check you over.

11:48.275 --> 11:49.509
I'm straight. Thank you.

11:49.542 --> 11:51.244
Stop lying, boy.
JAMAL:
Hakeem, what happened?

11:51.278 --> 11:52.445
Man, you all right?
I said I'm straight.

11:52.479 --> 11:53.881
ANDRE:
You need something, bro?

11:53.914 --> 11:56.683
I don't need nothing except
for all y'all to fall back.

11:56.716 --> 11:59.186
Tell your mother where you
disappeared for five hours.
Hakeem, can you see

11:59.219 --> 12:00.687
out of your eye?
Is there anything
that you can recall...

12:00.720 --> 12:02.122
I'm good, yo!

12:02.155 --> 12:03.623
Why don't you let me determine
if there are any injuries,

12:03.656 --> 12:04.792
then we can go from there.

12:04.825 --> 12:06.426
I got nothing but a jacked eye.
That's it.

12:06.459 --> 12:08.195
I'd like to see
if there are any signs

12:08.228 --> 12:09.897
of any other
kind of abuse.

12:09.930 --> 12:11.264
I'm out of here, yo.

12:11.298 --> 12:12.632
COOKIE:
No.
No, you're gonna
take your ass

12:12.665 --> 12:13.733
in the dining room

12:13.767 --> 12:15.135
and let the doctor
do his job.

12:15.168 --> 12:16.703

12:16.736 --> 12:18.906
COOKIE:
Why is she

12:18.939 --> 12:19.973
blowing up your phone?

12:20.007 --> 12:21.708
Leave him alone, Mama.
Mama.

12:21.741 --> 12:23.743
Would you please
take off your jacket?

12:32.585 --> 12:34.154
(doors close)

12:34.187 --> 12:36.924
(sighs)

12:36.957 --> 12:38.225
Lucious, I recommended

12:38.258 --> 12:39.960
a couple of stitches
for the eye,

12:39.993 --> 12:42.462
but it will close
with those butterfly bandages.

12:42.495 --> 12:45.232
Other than that,
there's no serious injuries.

12:45.265 --> 12:47.334
Boy's very lucky.

12:47.367 --> 12:48.768
Doc, here.

12:48.802 --> 12:50.570
I owe you. Thank you.

12:50.603 --> 12:52.439
You're welcome.
COOKIE:
Hakeem, what is
wrong with you?

12:52.472 --> 12:55.108
You can't tell we was worried
about your ungrateful ass?

12:55.142 --> 12:57.010
I'm just ready to go.
I need a ride.

12:57.044 --> 12:58.345
LUCIOUS:
No, what happened to you, son,

12:58.378 --> 13:00.013
is my worst nightmare.
HAKEEM: It can't be worse

13:00.047 --> 13:01.348
than the nightmare
of being your son.

13:01.381 --> 13:03.083
No. I ain't your mama.

13:03.116 --> 13:04.451
Watch how you talk to me.

13:04.484 --> 13:05.452
Gotta watch nothing.

13:05.485 --> 13:06.519
We in here tripping

13:06.553 --> 13:07.687
like we some
white picket fence family.

13:07.720 --> 13:08.956
Tell yourself whatever you need

13:08.989 --> 13:10.991
so you can go to sleep,
but recognize

13:11.024 --> 13:13.460
none of this would've gone down
if I wasn't your son.

13:13.493 --> 13:15.128
This is because of you and you.

13:15.162 --> 13:16.196
What? Boy...

13:16.229 --> 13:17.965
No, no, no. Let him go.

13:17.998 --> 13:18.966
Let him go.

13:18.999 --> 13:21.601
He's just humiliated right now.

13:21.634 --> 13:23.403
Give him a few days.

13:26.406 --> 13:28.375
Staples Center passed on me.
What?

13:28.408 --> 13:30.677
They claim that I am,
quote-unquote,

13:30.710 --> 13:33.180
"too narrow of an artist
to fill their stadium."

13:33.213 --> 13:34.714
That's code word for gay.

13:34.747 --> 13:36.283
And I'm sorry,
Dad, that's because

13:36.316 --> 13:37.885
Empire keeps on marketing
me as a gay artist.

13:37.918 --> 13:38.886
But that's what you are.

13:38.919 --> 13:39.887
That's not what I am.

13:39.920 --> 13:41.121
I'm gay and I'm an artist,

13:41.154 --> 13:42.389
but that don't make me
a gay artist,

13:42.422 --> 13:44.391
and you of all people
should understand that.

13:44.424 --> 13:45.558
(door slams)

13:45.592 --> 13:46.894
And I'm gonna tell you
this much, Dad:

13:46.927 --> 13:48.361
I'm gonna fire the whole
damn marketing team,

13:48.395 --> 13:50.397
Steve Cho and all them suckers,
if they don't get it together.

13:50.430 --> 13:52.632
No, you're not gonna
fire anybody.

13:52.665 --> 13:54.167
You're gonna take that passion,

13:54.201 --> 13:56.403
you're gonna put it
into the song.

13:56.436 --> 13:59.006
Can you start it from, um,
right before the third hook,

13:59.039 --> 14:00.507
middle part of
the-the high part?

14:00.540 --> 14:01.674
Thank you.

la, la, la, love, love *

14:35.976 --> 14:39.279

(chuckles)

14:55.495 --> 14:57.530
Jamieson.

14:57.564 --> 14:58.898
LUCIOUS:
Why is Jamieson Hinthrop

14:58.932 --> 14:59.933
in my studio?

14:59.967 --> 15:01.534
Your brilliant
son asked me

15:01.568 --> 15:04.537
for help reaching the heights
that he so richly deserves.

15:04.571 --> 15:05.973
You do want that, right?

15:06.006 --> 15:07.975
D-Don't worry about what I want

15:08.008 --> 15:09.309
or what my son wants.

15:09.342 --> 15:11.878
You know what, I didn't need
this clown in my life.

15:11.911 --> 15:13.246
You don't need him in yours.

15:13.280 --> 15:14.714
What is this?

15:14.747 --> 15:18.051
Your father almost signed
with me after he left Beretti.

15:18.085 --> 15:20.053
Till he found out I was gay.

15:20.087 --> 15:22.322
Oh.

15:22.355 --> 15:23.991
No, I didn't know that.

15:24.024 --> 15:25.658
Well, look, times have changed.

15:25.692 --> 15:27.394
Exactly. That's why
you don't need him.

15:27.427 --> 15:29.596
You don't even work
with artists anymore, do you?

15:29.629 --> 15:32.665
You're just a rich dude
that throws these lavish parties

15:32.699 --> 15:33.967
and tries to manipulate
political candidates.

15:34.001 --> 15:35.402
That's right, Lucious.

15:35.435 --> 15:37.971
I am devoting the rest
of my life to making the world

15:38.005 --> 15:40.340
a better place for LGBT people.

15:40.373 --> 15:42.642
And I want to help you, Jamal.

15:42.675 --> 15:44.744
And he's on the board
of the Staples Center, Dad.

15:44.777 --> 15:47.814
Look, Mal, there's all kinds
of vampires in this business.

15:47.847 --> 15:49.582
Some suck your blood,

15:49.616 --> 15:52.352
others will suck your...
Dad, don't d...
Nuh-uh. Don't do that.

15:52.385 --> 15:55.322
The day I found out
that Lucious Lyon had a gay son

15:55.355 --> 15:57.857
is the day that I knew,
I knew right then and there,

15:57.890 --> 15:59.859
that there was a God.

15:59.892 --> 16:01.461
Okay, see, nuh-uh.
All of this

16:01.494 --> 16:02.996
back and forth is not
gonna go down.

16:03.030 --> 16:04.864
Whatever issue that you two have
with each other is

16:04.897 --> 16:07.034
between the both of
you, okay? Jamieson,

16:07.067 --> 16:08.368
I brought you on board
because Empire

16:08.401 --> 16:09.702
is marketing me in a niche way.

16:09.736 --> 16:10.537
Yeah.
Dad,

16:10.570 --> 16:12.205
I have to undo that. Period.

16:12.239 --> 16:14.874
I say we put
the past behind us.

16:14.907 --> 16:18.378
Jamal is a major talent, poised
to break all kinds of barriers,

16:18.411 --> 16:22.815
and I would be honored
to use all of my influence

16:22.849 --> 16:24.917
to help pave that way.

16:34.027 --> 16:36.496

Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

17:33.720 --> 17:35.955
This ain't the song
I came up with.

17:35.988 --> 17:37.624
It is, Hakeem.

17:37.657 --> 17:40.527
Uh, the playback's a little
faster, but we can slow it down.

17:40.560 --> 17:42.795
How you gonna tell me, man?
I know the song I wrote.

17:42.829 --> 17:44.397
How the hell y'all
think y'all ready

17:44.431 --> 17:46.733
with y'all voice
sounding like static?

17:54.741 --> 17:55.642
Who were
your musical inspirations?

17:55.675 --> 17:56.909
EPMD,

17:56.943 --> 17:59.146
KRS-One, Public Enemy,

17:59.179 --> 18:00.480
any other hardcore Negro

18:00.513 --> 18:02.482
not afraid to take it
to the streets.

18:02.515 --> 18:04.217
If you could change one thing
about hip-hop today,

18:04.251 --> 18:05.485
what would it be?

18:05.518 --> 18:07.654
(snapping gum)

18:07.687 --> 18:09.088
You think
hip-hop loves women?

18:09.122 --> 18:11.724
You do know what "P-Busta"
stand for, right, playa?

18:11.758 --> 18:13.660
Any other revenue streams
you think we should explore

18:13.693 --> 18:15.495
in order to best tap
your fan base?

18:24.137 --> 18:26.506
So, J Poppa, instead
of asking questions,

18:26.539 --> 18:28.141
let me just cut to the quick.

18:28.175 --> 18:29.809
I'm assuming the "J"
in "J Poppa" stands

18:29.842 --> 18:31.611
for "joints"? "Jewels"?

18:31.644 --> 18:32.512
"Jigga"?

18:32.545 --> 18:35.148
Nah, man.

18:35.182 --> 18:37.584
It's 'cause
my first name is Job.

18:37.617 --> 18:38.951
As in the Book of Job?

18:40.320 --> 18:41.754
"I know that my redeemer lives,

18:41.788 --> 18:44.090
and that, in the end,
he shall stand on the earth."

18:44.123 --> 18:47.093
Job 19:25.

18:47.126 --> 18:49.296
I'm a PK.

18:49.329 --> 18:52.599
Well, actually,
I'm a preacher's grandkid.

18:52.632 --> 18:54.367
So that's where
the "Poppa" comes from.

18:54.401 --> 18:56.203
A man's gotta show some love
to Grampoppa

18:56.236 --> 18:58.971
for keeping me off the streets
and letting me work on my music.

18:59.005 --> 19:00.507
You ever think
about incorporating the Word

19:00.540 --> 19:01.708
into your music?

19:01.741 --> 19:03.543
You could reach
a lot more people

19:03.576 --> 19:05.712
with the light than you can
with the darkness, brother.

19:17.724 --> 19:19.158
Are you for real?

19:19.192 --> 19:20.693
Oh, yeah.

19:20.727 --> 19:22.562
Let's do business.

19:27.434 --> 19:29.068
It's gonna be fun.

19:29.101 --> 19:31.238
LUCIOUS:
You know this business, Cookie.

19:31.271 --> 19:33.306
Y'all damn near
asked for it.

19:33.340 --> 19:36.543
Maybe you're just not cut out
for this part of the hustle.

19:36.576 --> 19:38.911
He's your son, Lucious,
and he got hurt.

19:38.945 --> 19:41.914
Baby, you know there are two
kinds of security in hip-hop.

19:41.948 --> 19:44.251
There's the house dog
and then there's

19:44.284 --> 19:46.686
the junkyard dog. And if you
gonna make it in this game,

19:46.719 --> 19:48.087
you need both of them.

19:48.120 --> 19:51.023
And the only reason you ain't
had to think about none of this

19:51.057 --> 19:53.192
is because I've created
this blanket of security

19:53.226 --> 19:55.194
with Empire.

19:55.228 --> 19:57.196
So you gonna use this
as a way to say

19:57.230 --> 19:59.866
we need to give up
and crawl back to you?

19:59.899 --> 20:02.201
No, I don't want you back,
Cookie.

20:02.235 --> 20:03.936
Just Hakeem.

20:03.970 --> 20:05.605
And if you love him

20:05.638 --> 20:08.441
like you say you love him,
Cookie,

20:08.475 --> 20:10.443
you're gonna want that for him.

20:10.477 --> 20:12.111
Listen, baby,
these wolves,

20:12.144 --> 20:14.281
they done sunk
they teeth into you.

20:14.314 --> 20:16.215
They ain't gonna let go
until they open up a vein,

20:16.249 --> 20:19.118
and when they open it up,
they never letting it close.

20:19.151 --> 20:22.289
And you gonna learn the hard way
why you need somebody like me

20:22.322 --> 20:23.790
in your corner.

20:23.823 --> 20:25.392
(scoffs)

20:25.425 --> 20:27.394
You just gonna leave us
to the wolves?

20:27.427 --> 20:30.062
So you can prove
your little stupid point?

20:30.096 --> 20:32.632
You ain't a
boss, Lucious.

20:32.665 --> 20:34.133
You's a busta.

20:34.166 --> 20:35.067
Cookie...

20:35.101 --> 20:37.837
Cookie, my ass.

20:43.075 --> 20:44.511
Mmm.

20:45.578 --> 20:46.779
(scoffs)

20:54.454 --> 20:57.256
(door opens, closes)

20:59.659 --> 21:01.160
*

21:01.193 --> 21:02.595
(glass clinks)

21:02.629 --> 21:04.831
HAKEEM: * ...new Benz
and that spoiler, whip... *

21:04.864 --> 21:06.833
* Thirsty, need to sip...

21:06.866 --> 21:09.569
* On my dollars, uh

21:09.602 --> 21:13.105
(distorted):
* I ain't never gonna fall off,
I see most of y'all caught up *

21:13.139 --> 21:16.008
* Keep on one hundred, mess up,
keep on one hundred, mess up *

21:16.042 --> 21:17.176
* Dollars in the bank...

21:17.209 --> 21:18.345
(glass shatters)

21:18.378 --> 21:19.946
(music stops)

21:19.979 --> 21:22.415
(panting)

21:22.449 --> 21:24.451
(rapping inaudibly)

21:29.322 --> 21:30.790
* Keep on one hundred,
mess up the drama *

21:30.823 --> 21:32.359
* You don't want no drama,
'cause money too long *

21:32.392 --> 21:34.894
* Get that,
don't play with me. *

21:40.132 --> 21:42.702
COOKIE:
Hakeem. Okay, Hakeem.

21:42.735 --> 21:44.203
Look, you need to calm down.

21:44.236 --> 21:45.705
I told you I got this
under control, right?

21:45.738 --> 21:47.874
Look, I'm meeting
with a top security firm

21:47.907 --> 21:49.108
right now as we speak.

21:49.141 --> 21:50.643
Okay? So...

21:52.211 --> 21:54.213
His little ass hung up on me.

21:54.246 --> 21:56.315
(chuckles) Arguing with him
isn't gonna help.

21:56.349 --> 21:58.651
(chuckles)
Lucious didn't set this up,

21:58.685 --> 22:00.720
but he might as well have,
'cause this is playing

22:00.753 --> 22:02.489
right into his hands.

22:02.522 --> 22:05.758
(sighs) I need to get
a security team in place.

22:08.327 --> 22:09.629
Hear me out, right?

22:09.662 --> 22:12.031
Before you say
anything.

22:12.064 --> 22:13.633
What if you hired the cats

22:13.666 --> 22:15.535
that snatched Hakeem
and jacked Tiana?

22:15.568 --> 22:16.536
Are you stupid?

22:16.569 --> 22:17.537
(chuckles)

22:17.570 --> 22:18.605
You being serious?

22:19.939 --> 22:21.374
Yeah.

22:21.408 --> 22:22.875
I told you
I used to be a cop.

22:22.909 --> 22:24.243
Mm-hmm.

22:24.276 --> 22:26.546
15 years ago, when I was
a rookie on the job,

22:26.579 --> 22:28.214
there was a rash
of these quick grabs, right?

22:28.247 --> 22:30.216
All of them
in the rap industry.

22:30.249 --> 22:32.218
And the department
was chasing its own tail,

22:32.251 --> 22:34.887
trying to figure out
who's pulling this off.

22:34.921 --> 22:37.557
It turns out, right when
we got it locked down,

22:37.590 --> 22:38.891
they all just stopped.

22:38.925 --> 22:40.259
And you know why?

22:40.292 --> 22:43.563
'Cause the labels
put them on payroll.

22:43.596 --> 22:44.897
They were hitting
them off legitimately,

22:44.931 --> 22:46.198
'cause it's easier
that way for everybody.

22:46.232 --> 22:48.735
"Legitimately."

22:48.768 --> 22:51.738
House dogs and
junkyard dogs.

22:51.771 --> 22:53.573
(sighs)

22:53.606 --> 22:57.209
No, no. I don't want those
wolves in my house. No.

22:57.243 --> 22:58.445
Then hire ex-cops
at Lyon Dynasty.

22:58.478 --> 22:59.546
I... No!

22:59.579 --> 23:01.748
I don't mess with cops.

23:03.816 --> 23:04.784
Oh, no offense.

23:04.817 --> 23:07.253
Nah, none taken.

23:07.286 --> 23:08.621
(clicks tongue)

23:08.655 --> 23:10.590
Guess I just got to
pay someone then.

23:10.623 --> 23:12.291
(sighs)

23:12.324 --> 23:15.294
Uh, if those wolves get
into your house,

23:15.327 --> 23:16.295
I got you.

23:16.328 --> 23:17.630
(scoffs)

23:17.664 --> 23:18.965
You gonna be my
wolf slayer, huh?

23:18.998 --> 23:20.299
That's right.
(laughs)

23:20.332 --> 23:21.568
Wolves, dragons.

23:21.601 --> 23:23.102
Dragons.
Lions.

23:23.135 --> 23:24.604
(chuckles) Yeah,
well, it's the Lyons

23:24.637 --> 23:26.105
you need to look
out for, 'cause...

23:26.138 --> 23:27.774
Uh, I can handle
the Lyons.

23:27.807 --> 23:28.775
(scoffs)

23:28.808 --> 23:30.109
Especially the lioness.

23:30.142 --> 23:33.480
* I'm starting to realize

23:33.513 --> 23:38.317
* Pressure

23:38.350 --> 23:42.354
* Pressure, I know you feel

23:45.024 --> 23:49.829
* Pressure

23:49.862 --> 23:53.199
* Pressure,
just keep it real... *

23:55.201 --> 23:57.169
Hmm.

23:57.203 --> 23:59.405
I'll set up the meeting.

23:59.438 --> 24:01.440
JAMAL: Ma, I been hitting
Hakeem, like, three times.

24:01.474 --> 24:02.509
He ain't hit me back.

24:02.542 --> 24:03.976
COOKIE: I'm really worried
about him, Mal.

24:04.010 --> 24:06.078
I'm starting to worry
about him, too.

24:06.112 --> 24:09.415
Maybe I should just cancel
the Big Apple Jam.

24:09.448 --> 24:10.983
Why would you do
that? Don't do that.

24:11.017 --> 24:13.019
Andre and I will
get Hakeem.

24:13.052 --> 24:14.353
Make him come around.

24:14.386 --> 24:16.689
You just keep the
train on the rail.

24:16.723 --> 24:18.691
It's kind of a big deal
for the Lyon Dynasty.

24:18.725 --> 24:21.127
It's nice
that you said that.

24:21.160 --> 24:23.029
Let's just hope that
Hakeem comes to his senses

24:23.062 --> 24:25.632
and knows what a big
opportunity you set up.

24:25.665 --> 24:28.835
Thanks, Jamal.

24:28.868 --> 24:31.103
I set up a meet with the guys
who snatched Hakeem.

24:31.137 --> 24:32.605
I'm taking him with me.

24:32.639 --> 24:34.641
The boy needs to feel
like a man again.

24:38.645 --> 24:39.946
You clear on
what we're doing, right?

24:39.979 --> 24:41.280
You're running
the meet.

24:41.313 --> 24:42.615
Yeah, and I'm letting
you get your come-up.

24:42.649 --> 24:44.383
But you gonna be good?

24:44.416 --> 24:45.384
You gonna be good?

24:45.417 --> 24:46.719
Yeah, Mom.
Shh.

24:46.753 --> 24:48.588
Let's just get the
negotiation done.
All right.

24:50.256 --> 24:52.592
Thank you for taking
the time to meet with us.

24:53.860 --> 24:56.563
So who you calling a
little bitch now, huh?!

25:06.606 --> 25:08.007
Hakeem...

25:08.040 --> 25:10.242
please...

25:10.276 --> 25:12.144
lower the gun, baby.

25:12.178 --> 25:13.813
Hakeem!

25:13.846 --> 25:15.347
(distorted): * I ain't
talkin' 'bout ones... *

25:15.381 --> 25:16.916
Hakeem...
You really think
I'm gonna make

25:16.949 --> 25:18.184
a plan with
these fools?!

25:18.217 --> 25:19.986
Yes! Yes, because that's

25:20.019 --> 25:22.188
what we came here to do,
all right?

25:23.890 --> 25:27.093
Now, ain't no good solution
in you pulling that trigger.

25:27.126 --> 25:28.360
I'm-a pull his number!

25:28.394 --> 25:30.262
Why you so quiet?!
No, no, no, no.

25:30.296 --> 25:32.799
(voice distorting, echoing)
...Hakeem, okay?

25:35.935 --> 25:38.871
Hakeem...

25:38.905 --> 25:41.908
if you pull the trigger...

25:41.941 --> 25:45.612
you're gonna force me
to step in front of the bullet.

25:45.645 --> 25:47.714
(distorted):
* I just say it's nothin'...

25:47.747 --> 25:48.615
* Keep it one hundred...

25:50.650 --> 25:53.953
I'd rather die
than lose you again.

25:57.824 --> 25:59.225
(softly):
Please?

26:03.062 --> 26:05.632
Now let's talk.

26:05.665 --> 26:10.236
Yeah, well, due to these
unforeseen circumstances,

26:10.269 --> 26:12.639
I'm doubling
our weekly security fee.

26:12.672 --> 26:14.907
(chuckles)

26:14.941 --> 26:16.643
You step near me,

26:16.676 --> 26:19.045
my artists or
my family again,

26:19.078 --> 26:21.681
you won't even hear
the knock at the door.

26:22.615 --> 26:23.816
Are we clear?

26:25.184 --> 26:27.419
Bitch, I said,
are we clear?

26:27.453 --> 26:29.388
We good.

26:29.421 --> 26:30.990
Now...

26:31.023 --> 26:34.326
welcome to my
streets, bitch.

26:34.360 --> 26:36.228
J POPPA:
Gutter Life for life, y'all!

26:36.262 --> 26:38.164
* Playin' with my toys every day
like a playpen *

26:38.197 --> 26:39.832
* Ears to the street
like I'm 'sleep *

26:39.866 --> 26:41.500
* On the pavement
so I can hear 'em talkin' *

26:41.533 --> 26:44.236
* Wishin' I fall off,
no limit on my card *

26:44.270 --> 26:45.738
* So they know
that I ball hard *

26:45.772 --> 26:48.440
* Playin' with my toys every day
like a playpen *

26:48.474 --> 26:50.677
* Ears to the street like
I'm 'sleep on the pavement *

26:50.710 --> 26:53.345
* So I can hear 'em talkin',
wishin' I fall off *

26:53.379 --> 26:56.248
* No limit on my card, so they
know that I ball hard... *

26:56.282 --> 26:58.017
Look at J Poppa gettin' it.
Go ahead, brother.

26:58.050 --> 26:59.819
He do all right.

26:59.852 --> 27:02.521
Uh-huh. How's that wand
working for you?

27:02.554 --> 27:03.690
Why are you so nasty?

27:03.723 --> 27:05.624
You nasty!
But, uh...

27:05.658 --> 27:07.126
* Like change for a twenty...

27:07.159 --> 27:09.128
...that wand is hitting
it correctly.

27:09.161 --> 27:10.830
Yes, it is hitting
all the walls.

27:10.863 --> 27:13.599
Yo, I be so weak in the damn
knees, I can hardly stand.

27:13.632 --> 27:15.868
I just take a step and
I just be, like, uh!

27:15.902 --> 27:17.670
Like... sha-shanda!
(laughs)

27:17.704 --> 27:19.939
Okay, yo, I'm gonna go talk
to Dre. I'll be back.

27:19.972 --> 27:21.540
All right. Hey.

27:21.573 --> 27:22.942
* My competition is minimal

27:22.975 --> 27:24.944
* We can line 'em all up
and then sort 'em out *

27:24.977 --> 27:27.146
* If there's a dude realer than
me, then please point him out *

27:27.179 --> 27:28.547
* Please, please *

27:28.580 --> 27:31.483
* Playin' with my toys every day
like a playpen *

27:31.517 --> 27:34.887
* Ears to the street like
I'm 'sleep on the pavement *

27:34.921 --> 27:37.156
* So I can hear 'em talkin',
wishin' I fall off *

27:37.189 --> 27:38.457
* No limit on my card, so they
know that I ball hard... *

27:38.490 --> 27:40.893
Nice house,
big brother.

27:40.927 --> 27:42.394
You heard
from Hakeem?

27:42.428 --> 27:44.230
Not a word.
He's off the reservation.

27:44.263 --> 27:45.865
I'm worried about him.

27:45.898 --> 27:47.633
Yeah, me, too.

27:47.666 --> 27:49.401
Hopefully, he'll come around,
but if not,

27:49.435 --> 27:51.137
we pull him back up.
Bet.

27:51.170 --> 27:52.638
Yo, he's fired up.

27:52.671 --> 27:55.742
He's much more than that.
He's my archangel Michael,

27:55.775 --> 27:58.310
rolling to the depths
of hell with me.

27:58.344 --> 27:59.678
Which is why
I'm willing to overlook

27:59.712 --> 28:00.880
their relationship for now.

28:00.913 --> 28:02.248
Who?
Oh, don't play with me, man.

28:02.281 --> 28:04.016
I know they got
a thing going on.

28:04.050 --> 28:06.018
It could be a major problem
having an A&R

28:06.052 --> 28:07.553
consorting with
an artist, Jamal.

28:07.586 --> 28:10.089
You know how many deals
have been made in bed?

28:10.122 --> 28:12.391
Just let her have this one.
It's real; ain't a problem.

28:12.424 --> 28:14.426
It won't be a problem
till it's a problem.

28:14.460 --> 28:16.428
* Every day like a playpen,
ears to the street *

28:16.462 --> 28:18.364
* Like I'm 'sleep
on the pavement *

28:18.397 --> 28:19.665
* So I can hear 'em talkin'

28:19.698 --> 28:21.700
* Wishin' I fall off,
no limit on my card *

28:21.734 --> 28:24.036
* So they know that I ball hard,
for I do not *

28:24.070 --> 28:25.772
* Understand what I do

28:25.805 --> 28:28.607
* For what I want to do,
I do not do *

28:28.640 --> 28:31.210
* But what I do not want to do,
I agree that *

28:31.243 --> 28:33.679
* The law is good,
and I put that on my hood... *

28:33.712 --> 28:35.014
What the hell was that?

28:35.047 --> 28:36.382
LUCIOUS: That's what
I want to know.

28:36.415 --> 28:37.750
What in the hell
is that?

28:37.784 --> 28:39.886
That's Romans 7,
verse 15 through 16.

28:39.919 --> 28:41.120
My man.

28:41.153 --> 28:43.522
Look at that, the
bloggers are loving it.

28:43.555 --> 28:45.892
BECKY:
With all due respect, Lucious,

28:45.925 --> 28:47.894
I don't think
that Andre understands

28:47.927 --> 28:49.796
the philosophy of the label.

28:49.829 --> 28:52.131
Doesn't sound like there's any
respect in that at all, Becky.

28:52.164 --> 28:54.433
Wait a minute, are you making
your decisions from a Bible

28:54.466 --> 28:55.935
or from a business degree?

28:55.968 --> 28:58.237
It's purely business,
Pop, I assure you.

28:58.270 --> 28:59.705
Look, I didn't
force him to do

28:59.738 --> 29:01.040
anything he didn't
want to do, okay?

29:01.073 --> 29:02.641
* Control my energy and effort

29:02.674 --> 29:05.945
* So this year, I'm finna bring
the pressure, come on... *

29:05.978 --> 29:07.646
Yo, Dad.

29:07.679 --> 29:09.982
I'm going to a little party
at Jamieson's. You want to roll?

29:10.016 --> 29:12.218
Hell no.
Been there, done that.

29:12.251 --> 29:13.719
Oh, r-really?

29:13.752 --> 29:15.721
I hope he delivers
everything he promised you.

29:15.754 --> 29:16.956
Watch yourself.

29:16.989 --> 29:18.657
Will do.

29:18.690 --> 29:20.692
(cheering)

29:26.532 --> 29:28.667
Gutter Life for life!

29:28.700 --> 29:31.904
Gutter Life for life...!

29:31.938 --> 29:33.806
CROWD:
Gutter Life for life!

29:33.840 --> 29:36.909
Hey, yo, Lucious, why don't you
spit some bars for us, man?

29:36.943 --> 29:39.745
Nah, tonight is not about me;
tonight is about

29:39.778 --> 29:42.314
these incredible artists
from the hood that came

29:42.348 --> 29:45.417
to nourish us with some of
the stories from their soul.

29:45.451 --> 29:47.920
And like it's always said,
"Hip-hop is a dish

29:47.954 --> 29:50.857
best served raw,"
like this next MC,

29:50.890 --> 29:54.526
the powerful Miss Freda Gatz!

29:54.560 --> 29:58.064
*
(cheering, rhythmic clapping)

30:02.001 --> 30:03.635
* I'm Derek Jeter
with the pitch *
* Pitch *

30:03.669 --> 30:05.437
* Bruce Lee up with the kick
* Kick *

30:05.471 --> 30:06.873
* Lucious Lyon with the whip

30:06.906 --> 30:08.474
* Whip *
* Boss bitch, I keep a clip

30:08.507 --> 30:09.876
* Freda poppin' on anybody

30:09.909 --> 30:11.443
* Wanna take it there,
I don't break for air *

30:11.477 --> 30:13.612
* I keep my gun cocked
'cause I'm never scared *

30:13.645 --> 30:14.646
* So hell no,
we can't play it fair... *

30:14.680 --> 30:17.216
This one is
not even up for debate.

30:17.249 --> 30:19.051
Long as she clears the bar.

30:19.085 --> 30:22.488
(chuckles):
I'm only kiddin', Pop.

30:22.521 --> 30:24.390
* This drug money murder,
all I really know *

30:24.423 --> 30:26.458
* Bang, bang, bang,
had to let 'em know *

30:26.492 --> 30:28.560
* One shot to the neck, boy,
y'all gon' give me *

30:28.594 --> 30:29.996
* My respect, boy...

30:30.029 --> 30:32.298
Take that weak-ass sauce
back to Brownsville, ugly bitch!

30:32.331 --> 30:34.333
(crowd groaning)

30:34.366 --> 30:37.003
* They all know my name
and you know it *

30:37.036 --> 30:38.337
* I'm the boss
and you know it *

30:38.370 --> 30:39.972
* I do what I want
and you know it *

30:40.006 --> 30:41.908
* I don't play no game
and you know it *

30:41.941 --> 30:43.742
* They all know my name
and you know it *

30:43.775 --> 30:44.743
You're a corn muffin.

30:44.776 --> 30:46.412
Hang the mic up already.

30:46.445 --> 30:48.414
(crowd jeering)

30:48.447 --> 30:49.681
Stay focused.

30:51.683 --> 30:52.919
CROWD:
Oh!

30:52.952 --> 30:54.921
LUCIOUS:
Damn!

30:57.456 --> 30:59.825
MAN: Come on, girl. Come on,
Fre, let's go. Outta here!

30:59.858 --> 31:01.527
ANDRE: Dad.
LUCIOUS: No. There's nothing
to talk about.

31:01.560 --> 31:03.829
One of our artists, she kicked
a dude in the face, Pop.

31:03.862 --> 31:05.764
No. "Our artists"?
This is my artist.

31:05.797 --> 31:07.599
Our stocks haven't recovered
from your prison stint,

31:07.633 --> 31:10.102
from the Fed raid--
she is too much of a liability

31:10.136 --> 31:11.603
for a public company, Pop.

31:11.637 --> 31:13.339
Now, remember how Seagram's
had to drop Death Row

31:13.372 --> 31:15.274
even though Death Row
was making, what,
a hundred million a year?

31:15.307 --> 31:17.009
Look, tomorrow you and
your MBA number crunchers

31:17.043 --> 31:19.278
can sit down and figure
out who you want to

31:19.311 --> 31:21.513
drop from the roster--
she's not one of them.

31:21.547 --> 31:22.448
You put me in charge.

31:22.481 --> 31:24.516
No, I put you in place.

31:24.550 --> 31:26.452
Don't confuse the two.

31:35.827 --> 31:37.629
ANNOUNCER:
Welcome to this year's

31:37.663 --> 31:39.131
Big Apple Jam!
Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

31:39.165 --> 31:41.800
No, you need to focus now.
Listen, listen, listen.

31:41.833 --> 31:42.801
When you take that stage,

31:42.834 --> 31:44.203
you own it, every inch,
you hear me?

31:44.236 --> 31:45.537
Shake your ass.

31:45.571 --> 31:47.473
Shake it. A lot.
I like that. Sex sells.

31:47.506 --> 31:49.041
Remember that.

31:49.075 --> 31:50.809
Every note you hit,
you do it like

31:50.842 --> 31:52.244
your life depends on it.

31:52.278 --> 31:53.479
You understand me?

31:54.446 --> 31:55.481
'Cause it damn near does.

31:55.514 --> 31:56.748
LAURA: We know when
we're coming in, right?

31:56.782 --> 31:58.917
Yeah, yeah, we got
it, we got it.
Does Hakeem

31:58.951 --> 32:00.352
got it, though?
He better.

32:07.593 --> 32:10.396
(distorted): * ...mess up...
keep on mess up *

32:10.429 --> 32:12.931
Come here.

32:12.965 --> 32:14.666
Why are you
driving yourself?

32:14.700 --> 32:16.668
'Cause ever since
I got out the joint,

32:16.702 --> 32:18.904
I don't like people
telling me where to go.

32:18.937 --> 32:23.009
Look, um... check out
this song I wrote.

32:23.042 --> 32:24.910
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

32:24.943 --> 32:27.980
* Bang, bang, bang, bang

32:28.014 --> 32:30.016
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

32:30.049 --> 32:32.684
* Bang, bang, bang, bang...

32:32.718 --> 32:35.521
I told you,
I don't need no tracks from you.

32:35.554 --> 32:39.258
This ain't for you;
this is about you.

32:39.291 --> 32:41.593
Look, the way I see it,
I can keep banging my head

32:41.627 --> 32:42.761
up against this wall,

32:42.794 --> 32:44.196
hoping that you're
gonna learn something

32:44.230 --> 32:46.098
that I want you to know,

32:46.132 --> 32:49.035
or I can let you bang
your own head until, eventually,

32:49.068 --> 32:50.969
you're gonna pay attention.

32:51.003 --> 32:52.204
And when that
moment happens--

32:52.238 --> 32:53.805
and I'm praying
that it's happening

32:53.839 --> 32:57.043
right now-- you're gonna realize
that it ain't about black eyes

32:57.076 --> 32:59.045
and bloody noses
in this business,

32:59.078 --> 33:00.712
it's about life or death.

33:00.746 --> 33:04.150
And that's what
this track reflects.

33:04.183 --> 33:06.485
* Bang, bang, bang, bang

33:06.518 --> 33:08.220
* Boom, boom, boom, boom...

33:08.254 --> 33:09.721
No strings.

33:09.755 --> 33:11.890
* Bang, bang, bang, bang

33:11.923 --> 33:14.460
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

33:14.493 --> 33:16.462
* Bang, bang, bang, bang

33:16.495 --> 33:17.896
* Boom, boom, boom, boom...

33:17.929 --> 33:21.467
Hey, Dad... with you,
there's always strings.

33:21.500 --> 33:23.069
Or more like

33:23.102 --> 33:25.404
ropes that choke everybody
around you.

33:26.938 --> 33:28.574
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

33:28.607 --> 33:31.510
* Bang, bang, bang, bang.

33:33.212 --> 33:34.580
Hakeem, are you okay? Hakeem?
COOKIE: No, no, no, no, no.

33:34.613 --> 33:36.748
Do you know where you come
in at? Don't worry about...

33:36.782 --> 33:38.217
Hakeem!
COOKIE:
Hey!

33:38.250 --> 33:40.152
Ladies, get the hell
out of here.

33:40.186 --> 33:42.321
Yo, I didn't ask you to come...

33:42.354 --> 33:44.256
Next time you turn
your back on me...

33:44.290 --> 33:45.424
Oh!
...I'm gonna
break it!

33:45.457 --> 33:46.758
Um, shut up. Lucious, look,

33:46.792 --> 33:48.860
that is not the way
you're gonna get through to him.

33:48.894 --> 33:51.597
No, I offered the boy
an olive branch.

33:51.630 --> 33:53.599
And the Pilgrims offered
the Indians a bunch of blankets.

33:53.632 --> 33:55.101
Oh, you want to man up now?

33:55.134 --> 33:57.269
Next time you pull a gun,
drop the hammer down.

33:57.303 --> 33:58.437
No, no, no.

33:58.470 --> 33:59.438
There will be no next...

33:59.471 --> 34:01.073
There will be
no next time.

34:01.107 --> 34:02.608
You understand me?

34:02.641 --> 34:04.276
Lucious, what do you want?

34:04.310 --> 34:06.678
You want your own son
to trade places with you

34:06.712 --> 34:08.114
in lockup, dummy?

34:08.147 --> 34:11.583
If that's what it takes for him
to grow a sack, so be it.

34:12.984 --> 34:14.953
Oh, come on in, boys.

34:14.986 --> 34:16.955
Your father's giving
a lovely lesson

34:16.988 --> 34:20.126
about how the whole family
could end up behind bars.

34:20.159 --> 34:21.393
LUCIOUS:
No, I'm giving a lesson

34:21.427 --> 34:22.894
on how to man the hell up

34:22.928 --> 34:25.464
instead of wallowing in
self-pity and bitch-ass-ness.

34:25.497 --> 34:27.633
You gonna use my name,
put some... put some...

34:27.666 --> 34:29.468
put a man behind it.
JAMAL:
Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad...

34:29.501 --> 34:31.237
Come on, come on.
We got this, all right?

34:31.270 --> 34:33.239
Both of y'all,
get out.
What?

34:33.272 --> 34:34.873
You two are
the problem.

34:34.906 --> 34:36.708
Okay, just leave us alone
with our brother.

34:36.742 --> 34:39.145
Give us a shot.
Y'all want to be
left alone, fine.

34:39.178 --> 34:40.879
Done.

34:40.912 --> 34:42.248
Mom.

34:42.281 --> 34:44.583
You, too.

34:51.022 --> 34:52.924
*

34:55.994 --> 34:58.330
Hakeem?

34:58.364 --> 35:02.334
Hakeem, I swear you do not
have to go out there right now.

35:02.368 --> 35:04.236
We can take you out of here
right now, start fresh tomorrow.

35:04.270 --> 35:05.337
Whatever you need, we're here.

35:05.371 --> 35:07.506
When the dudes pinned me up...

35:10.108 --> 35:11.710
...I ain't do nothing.

35:13.545 --> 35:15.847
I ain't fight back.

35:15.881 --> 35:17.015
I wasn't strong.

35:17.048 --> 35:18.317
Yeah, but you are alive.

35:18.350 --> 35:19.751
You're smart.

35:19.785 --> 35:21.753
You kept your cool, and
you're good, so for that,

35:21.787 --> 35:24.190
you're stronger and smarter
than anybody else on the block.

35:24.223 --> 35:25.991
Man, the three of us--
we can't be broken.

35:26.024 --> 35:27.759
Not by thugs or kidnappers
or anything else

35:27.793 --> 35:29.295
that comes at us.
You know why?

35:29.328 --> 35:30.796
Why?
Because we already

35:30.829 --> 35:32.498
beat the odds by
surviving as the children

35:32.531 --> 35:34.200
of Lucious and
Cookie Lyon.

35:34.233 --> 35:35.867
You already ahead
of the game.

35:35.901 --> 35:38.204
JAMAL:
Come on, man.

35:38.237 --> 35:39.538
Remember when you were little,
and you'd always

35:39.571 --> 35:41.473
stick up for me,
and you was a little French fry?

35:41.507 --> 35:42.841
Hell, I remember you
backing down dudes

35:42.874 --> 35:44.210
who were twice your size
for me.

35:44.243 --> 35:46.378
You're a better man

38:37.583 --> 38:39.184
'cause this party
is a little dead.

38:39.217 --> 38:41.620
And maybe we should get
a stripper pole or something.

38:41.653 --> 38:42.888
(laughter)
I'm down.

38:42.921 --> 38:44.623
We don't need
none of that.

38:44.656 --> 38:46.558
This is a boss-level
celebration, right?

38:46.592 --> 38:49.160
Look, this could be
big for all of us.

38:49.194 --> 38:50.362
Yeah.

38:50.396 --> 38:53.198
I want to thank you
for believing in me.

38:53.231 --> 38:55.567
You for trusting me.

38:55.601 --> 38:56.735
My man.

38:56.768 --> 38:59.838
And I want to thank you
for riding with me.

38:59.871 --> 39:01.540
Cheers up.

Cheers!

39:01.573 --> 39:03.241
Cheers up.
Turn up.
Turn up.

39:03.274 --> 39:04.876
Mirage á Trois!

39:04.910 --> 39:06.177
Yes.
Up.

39:06.211 --> 39:08.079
(knocking on door)
Mm-hmm. Hmm.

39:08.113 --> 39:10.516
Somebody at the door.

39:10.549 --> 39:12.083
Rack 'em.

39:12.117 --> 39:14.185
Rack 'em, sack 'em.

39:15.954 --> 39:16.922
Hakeem.

39:16.955 --> 39:18.189
Anika, what's up?
Oh, my God.

39:18.223 --> 39:20.358
I have been so worried.
I've been calling you.

39:20.392 --> 39:21.760
I know. I've been...

39:21.793 --> 39:24.530
It's been crazy lately.

39:24.563 --> 39:26.264
Thank you for being there
when I needed you.

39:31.302 --> 39:32.771
Right now ain't a good time.

39:32.804 --> 39:35.507
(laughs) I just wanted
to make sure you were all right.

39:35.541 --> 39:37.509
I'm straight. Thanks.

39:37.543 --> 39:40.546
Good.

39:40.579 --> 39:42.347
Call me if you need anything.

39:42.380 --> 39:44.215
All right.

39:44.249 --> 39:46.117
(sighs heavily)

39:46.151 --> 39:48.153
(muttering)

39:51.122 --> 39:53.258
I messed up, man.

39:53.291 --> 39:56.294
I already know, you gave me
a shot, and I blew it.

39:56.327 --> 39:58.697
You think I
should drop you?

39:58.730 --> 40:00.899
I wouldn't blame you.

40:00.932 --> 40:02.768
I'm not dropping you.

40:02.801 --> 40:04.169
I'm actually
pulling you in closer.

40:05.504 --> 40:08.306
Such a beautiful flame
inside of your eyes.

40:08.339 --> 40:10.876
A flame I only
saw in myself.

40:10.909 --> 40:13.812
Flame that was almost
snuffed out when I was a kid,

40:13.845 --> 40:15.647
when I lost both my parents.

40:15.681 --> 40:19.050
You and me-- we cut
from the same tree.

40:19.084 --> 40:21.319
I got three sons,
and none...

40:21.352 --> 40:22.654
Yeah?

40:22.688 --> 40:25.190
I identify more with you
than any one of them.

40:27.358 --> 40:28.994
I wrote a song for you.

40:29.027 --> 40:30.762
Want to hear it?

40:51.483 --> 40:54.385
(intro plays to
"Boom, Boom, Boom, Boom")

41:01.527 --> 41:03.862
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

41:03.895 --> 41:06.164
* Bang, bang, bang, bang...

41:06.197 --> 41:07.699
I was thinking
something like, uh...

41:07.733 --> 41:09.968
* Bang, bang, bang, bang

41:10.001 --> 41:13.371
* From the bottom I got up
to the top of the pros *

41:13.404 --> 41:15.373
* From the gutter to the
shutters trimmed out in gold *

41:15.406 --> 41:18.209
* Life bless my soul,
God bless my mo *

41:18.243 --> 41:21.379
* Nothing less than the best
so the rest is old *

41:21.412 --> 41:23.048
* Wanna play chess,
wanna lock and load *

41:23.081 --> 41:25.984
* Wanna send you home,
wanna tag your toe *

41:26.017 --> 41:29.220
* It ain't about the fame

41:29.254 --> 41:30.822
* Tell 'em what's my name

41:30.856 --> 41:32.490
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

41:32.524 --> 41:34.726
* Bang, bang, bang, bang

41:34.760 --> 41:37.395
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

41:37.428 --> 41:39.464
* Bang, bang, bang, bang

41:39.497 --> 41:41.466
* From the bottom I started

41:41.499 --> 41:43.068
* So there's nothing
that you can say to me *

41:43.101 --> 41:45.571
* I prodigal where I grew up,
and this the newest slavery *

41:45.604 --> 41:48.039
* People see you try hard, like
why you wanna play with me? *

41:48.073 --> 41:50.475
* I bring them heaters out,
somebody better pray for me *

41:50.508 --> 41:52.243
* 'Cause all I know is
this money, I gotta have it *

41:52.277 --> 41:53.912
* These suicidal thoughts
getting bad *

41:53.945 --> 41:55.246
* I'm getting madder

41:55.280 --> 41:57.415
* They say the good die young

41:57.448 --> 41:59.885
* I put the pedal to the metal,
hit the gas, then I'm gone *

41:59.918 --> 42:01.352
* Now I'm front line
at the court *

42:01.386 --> 42:02.821
* And I'm 'bout to take a shot

42:02.854 --> 42:04.923
* I pull it up,
cock it back, let it fly *

42:04.956 --> 42:06.257
* Now I'm watching
for the backboard *

42:06.291 --> 42:07.926
* And when they say
the world is yours *

42:07.959 --> 42:10.095
* I just let 'em know
that I'm just trying to score *

42:10.128 --> 42:11.429
* Boom, boom, boom, boom...

42:11.462 --> 42:12.931
(laughing)

42:12.964 --> 42:14.700
BOTH:
* Bang, bang, bang, bang

42:14.733 --> 42:17.435
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

42:17.468 --> 42:19.938
* Bang, bang, bang, bang...

42:19.971 --> 42:21.973
(knocking)

42:27.979 --> 42:30.982
So we gonna do this or what?

42:37.388 --> 42:40.959
Make me forget about everything
that happened this week, Laz.

42:40.992 --> 42:43.394
You said you got me, right?

42:43.428 --> 42:45.430
Yeah, I got you.

42:46.998 --> 42:49.000
I got you.

43:07.352 --> 43:09.220
(Cookie sighs)

43:09.254 --> 43:11.723
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

43:11.757 --> 43:13.458
* Bang, bang, bang, bang

43:13.491 --> 43:15.627
* Boom, boom, boom, boom
(Cookie laughs)

43:15.661 --> 43:17.929
* Bang, bang, bang, bang.

43:54.632 --> 43:55.801
Yeah.
