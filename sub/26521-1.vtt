-[thuds]

11:07.875 --> 11:10.419
This is my room. What is wrong with you?

11:10.503 --> 11:12.380
Not everyone's as sweet as you, Timmy.

11:12.463 --> 11:15.257
You gotta be firm with the pushy ones.
Push right back.

11:16.384 --> 11:20.012
If he doesn't wanna hang out with us,
maybe he could play downstairs.

11:22.139 --> 11:23.099
[whines]

11:23.182 --> 11:24.725
-[Gigi] Nope.
-[Boss Baby gasps]

11:24.809 --> 11:27.728
Who's the boss now, kid? Boom. Gigi.

11:28.354 --> 11:31.524
So, Timmy, I lost a pill box
in my purse last week.

11:31.941 --> 11:33.150
Can you find it for me?

11:33.234 --> 11:36.320
Yes! Gigi purse-diving. Watch this, baby.

11:38.239 --> 11:39.615
[inhales, exhales]

11:51.794 --> 11:52.628
Got it.

11:52.711 --> 11:54.547
I don't know how you do it!

11:54.630 --> 11:57.091
I can never find anything in that purse.

11:57.174 --> 12:01.262
Well, I'll be. It's full of gummy duckies.
Quack, quack.

12:01.345 --> 12:02.430
Thanks, Gigi.

12:02.513 --> 12:03.973
[munching]

12:04.056 --> 12:05.891
We should hang out all afternoon.

12:06.225 --> 12:07.059
[groans]

12:08.394 --> 12:10.354
-[both chuckling]
-Yeah!

12:10.438 --> 12:13.983
When the tornado hit, it lifted
the entire dump truck into the air.

12:14.066 --> 12:15.776
We flew across three states.

12:15.860 --> 12:17.528
[Tim] This one's for reptile rescue.

12:17.611 --> 12:19.947
And this one's for putting stickers neatly
on my helmet.

12:20.406 --> 12:24.618
[both laughing]

12:24.994 --> 12:28.789
"Though the world can be scary
and life sometimes seems unfair-y,

12:28.873 --> 12:32.543
you can sleep the whole night through.
I'll always be watching you."

12:33.502 --> 12:35.171
Creepy.

12:42.428 --> 12:45.222
That was fun, right? Gigi is so great.

12:45.306 --> 12:47.558
-Where are you going?
-Nowhere. Go back to sleep.

12:47.641 --> 12:49.268
-What's in your hand?
-Not important.

12:49.351 --> 12:52.271
-Sleep. Back to it. Go.
-Come on, what's going on?

12:52.354 --> 12:54.523
Don't worry, Templeton.
We're still brothers.

12:54.607 --> 12:57.943
Just maybe we don't have
to share  everything.

12:58.027 --> 13:01.572
Hey, you can't use my words on me.
Those are my words.

13:01.655 --> 13:04.575
[Mom] Tim, sweetheart,
it's time to go to sleep!

13:04.658 --> 13:07.495
[Gigi] Challenge authority, Timmy!
Don't let the man keep you down!

13:07.578 --> 13:10.414
-[Dad] Mom!
-[Mom] Nobody comes out of that room!

13:10.498 --> 13:12.374
Sorry. I just wanted to help.

13:16.003 --> 13:18.005
You wanna help?
Tell me you're not a snorer.

13:18.088 --> 13:20.966
How would I know?
I don't share a room with myself.

13:21.050 --> 13:23.427
Swell. Oh, that's lumpy.

13:25.971 --> 13:27.848
[yawns]

13:28.224 --> 13:31.185
Thanks for keeping the snoring down,
Templeton. Huh?

13:32.061 --> 13:32.895
Oh, no.

13:32.978 --> 13:34.772
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

13:35.397 --> 13:38.150
Staci, Jimbo, get over here now!
We've got a problem.

13:38.234 --> 13:40.236
[Staci] We're still under the bed, sir.

13:41.111 --> 13:45.199
Anyone could've taken it.
Guinea pig assassins, ninja puppies.

13:45.282 --> 13:46.325
Horse pirates.

13:46.408 --> 13:48.244
Miniature horse pirates!

13:48.327 --> 13:50.037
[gasps] Aw!

13:50.120 --> 13:51.580
-[door closes]
-[shushing]

13:52.373 --> 13:54.416
Is this about that thing
under your pillow?

13:55.292 --> 13:58.420
-He took it! Death to traitors!
-[screams]

13:58.504 --> 13:59.755
She's so sharp!

13:59.839 --> 14:01.924
Staci, calm down. Breathe.

14:02.800 --> 14:05.886
Nobody said Templeton
actually took the vial.

14:05.970 --> 14:07.805
Oh. I did.

14:08.430 --> 14:11.058
-[chuckles] Do you know what you've done?
-[yells]

14:11.141 --> 14:13.852
You've ruined Baby Corp. You've ruined me!

14:13.936 --> 14:16.814
Stop shaking me!
I just ate a very milky breakfast!

14:18.774 --> 14:22.027
I didn't steal your whatever it is.
I just hid it better.

14:22.403 --> 14:23.237
Go on.

14:23.320 --> 14:25.489
Never hide anything under your pillow.

14:25.573 --> 14:27.867
If the tooth fairy doesn't get it,
Mom and Dad will.

14:27.950 --> 14:29.869
I once hid a caramel apple under there

14:29.952 --> 14:31.245
-after Halloween...
-Skip ahead.

14:31.328 --> 14:34.331
I know the roommate thing is weird,
but I'm not gonna let you get busted.

14:34.415 --> 14:37.960
What's the point of being brothers
if we can't totally trust each other?

14:41.839 --> 14:44.174
So do you trust me enough to tell me
what's in that vial?

14:44.425 --> 14:45.885
Absolutely.

14:45.968 --> 14:49.763
If you trust me enough to show me
what's in your secret dinosaur drawer.

14:49.847 --> 14:52.558
It's private. None of your business.
You didn't look, right?

14:54.184 --> 14:56.353
Fine, we don't have to share everything.

14:56.437 --> 14:58.647
So, where's my vial?

14:58.898 --> 15:04.028
In the one place Mom and Dad
would never dare to look. Gigi's purse.

15:04.111 --> 15:07.531
The serum is in Gigi's purse?
Gigi, our grandmother?

15:07.698 --> 15:11.035
It's perfect. Not even Gigi
can find anything in that purse.

15:11.118 --> 15:13.203
It's like a portal to another dimension.

15:13.662 --> 15:16.498
You put something in there,
it's never coming out.

15:16.582 --> 15:18.125
Unless I get it out.

15:19.418 --> 15:23.672
I've been diving for Gigi's lost stuff
in that purse for the past seven years.

15:23.756 --> 15:25.799
I'm the only one who can crack the code.

15:26.216 --> 15:29.720
-Then crack out my vial and give it back!
-Okay. She's up in the kitchen.

15:34.308 --> 15:36.852
"Hi, Timmy.
A nice elderly gentleman invited me

15:36.936 --> 15:39.480
to check out the local senior center.
Back by lunch.

15:39.563 --> 15:42.983
Give yourself a hug for me, kiddo.
Your brother can stay in his crib."

15:43.067 --> 15:45.110
She is a terrible grandparent.

15:45.194 --> 15:47.529
-Senior center, let's go.
-No.

15:47.613 --> 15:51.116
I can't go into that place! Do you know
what they do to babies in there?

15:51.200 --> 15:52.368
[whimpering]

15:52.451 --> 15:53.744
Whoa, Jimbo.

15:53.827 --> 15:57.331
-It's just elderly people. They're nice.
-Then go get my vial!

15:57.414 --> 16:00.250
You don't think that'd be suspicious?
"Hey, Gigi, just came by

16:00.334 --> 16:02.878
to watch the square dancing.
Can I have your purse?"

16:02.962 --> 16:05.839
I need that vial, Templeton.
My future's in there.

16:05.923 --> 16:09.885
If our being brothers means anything,
you will find a way to fix this.

16:09.969 --> 16:13.138
Okay. If I can't get into that purse,
you are.

16:13.806 --> 16:14.807
I'm sorry, come again?

16:16.058 --> 16:18.102
Welcome to the art of purse diving.

16:18.310 --> 16:19.478
Your training begins...

16:20.980 --> 16:21.814
now.

16:21.897 --> 16:22.815
-Shut your eyes.
-Ah!

16:22.982 --> 16:25.734
Find the pretzel. You have ten seconds.

16:25.818 --> 16:27.194
Jimbo, count for me.

16:27.277 --> 16:28.529
One...

16:30.823 --> 16:31.865
Staci, count for me.

16:31.949 --> 16:33.367
Ten, nine...

16:33.826 --> 16:35.577
Okay. Thirteen-inches wide.

16:35.661 --> 16:37.496
-Canvas, maybe faux leather.
-Time's up!

16:37.579 --> 16:39.123
Don't think. Feel.

16:39.790 --> 16:42.418
Imagine the pretzel
is everything you ever wanted.

16:42.501 --> 16:43.627
It's within reach.

16:43.711 --> 16:44.753
Uh... Gah!

16:44.837 --> 16:46.422
-I grabbed a jack.
-Time's up.

16:46.505 --> 16:48.257
You didn't want it enough. Go!

16:48.340 --> 16:50.926
-[ticking]
-Four, three...

16:51.010 --> 16:53.554
The pretzel is that CEO job.

16:55.431 --> 16:56.724
-I got it!
-[alarm clock ringing]

16:57.307 --> 16:59.184
Congratulations. You're ready.

16:59.268 --> 17:01.353
-Yes!
-Whoo-hoo! Go, boss!

17:01.645 --> 17:05.065
Thank you, sensei, but I'm confused.
Won't it be even more suspicious

17:05.149 --> 17:07.568
if I'm the one showing up and raiding
Gigi's purse?

17:07.651 --> 17:11.363
If you have the right distraction,
she'll never know you were there.

17:13.240 --> 17:15.367
Whatever happens in that senior center,

17:15.451 --> 17:17.536
you have to promise you won't
make fun of me.

17:17.870 --> 17:21.540
Uh, I can't enter a binding contract
without reading the fine print. Ah!

17:21.623 --> 17:23.125
-Promise!
-Okay!

17:33.677 --> 17:35.721
[Staci] We'll never get past them all.

17:41.894 --> 17:43.562
-There!
-Just wait for my signal,

17:43.645 --> 17:45.481
-then go for the purse.
-And just how

17:45.564 --> 17:48.067
do you plan
to keep those dinosaurs busy?

17:48.150 --> 17:50.444
Funny you should mention dinosaurs.

17:51.612 --> 17:53.822
Uh, Gigis and gentlemen.

17:54.114 --> 17:56.700
Timmy! What a nice surprise.

and did what you told me.

on our family?

as many weird smells as babies.
