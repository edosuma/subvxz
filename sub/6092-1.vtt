[ Narrator] Legend has it,
in the mystic land of Prydain,

00:27.360 --> 00:30.800
there was once a king
so cruel and so evil...

00:30.880 --> 00:33.680
that even the gods
feared him.

00:33.760 --> 00:36.160
Since no prison
could hold him,

00:36.240 --> 00:40.560
he was thrown alive
into a crucible of molten iron.

00:40.640 --> 00:43.760
There, his demonic spirit
was captured...

00:43.840 --> 00:48.080
in the form
of a great Black Cauldron.

00:48.160 --> 00:50.000
For uncounted centuries,

00:50.080 --> 00:53.520
the Black Cauldron
lay hidden, waiting,

00:53.600 --> 00:56.400
while evil men
searched for it,

00:56.480 --> 00:59.360
knowing whoever possessed it
would have the power...

00:59.440 --> 01:03.520
to resurrect an army
of deathless warriors...

01:03.600 --> 01:07.120
and, with them,
rule the world.

01:36.720 --> 01:41.600
[ Man] There's something wrong.
I can feel it in my bones.

01:41.680 --> 01:44.160
- [ Bones Cracking]
- The Fairfolk know it too.

01:44.240 --> 01:47.520
- You don’t see any of them around.
- [ Meows]

01:47.600 --> 01:48.880
The Horned King,

01:50.160 --> 01:53.720
that black hearted devil.

01:53.800 --> 01:57.560
- [Continues Meowing]
-What's he waiting for?

01:57.640 --> 02:00.240
Yes, yes, cat.
I know you want your breakfast,

02:00.320 --> 02:03.600
but, just now,
thinking is more important.

02:03.680 --> 02:06.600
[Sighs, Gasping]

02:06.680 --> 02:09.759
Taran,
the pot is boiling over!

02:09.840 --> 02:15.280
-[ Pot Boiling]
-Oh, Dallben. I was just thinking.

02:15.360 --> 02:19.000
What if the war's over,
and I never had a chance to fight?

02:19.040 --> 02:21.840
Hmm, and a good thing too.

02:21.920 --> 02:25.240
War isn’t a game.
People get hurt.

02:25.320 --> 02:27.680
But I'm not afraid.
Ouch !

02:27.720 --> 02:29.680
[Chuckling]
Yes, there you are.

02:29.760 --> 02:31.640
If the Horned King
ever returns,

02:31.680 --> 02:33.600
you'll have a great deal more
to worry about...

02:33.680 --> 02:37.200
than a burned finger.

02:37.280 --> 02:41.120
No, no, no, cat. That is not for you.
It's for Hen Wen.

02:41.200 --> 02:44.000
Hen Wen, Hen Wen.
It's always Hen Wen !

02:44.080 --> 02:48.160
And one day, my boy,
you may learn why.

02:48.240 --> 02:52.400
Now, no more dreaming.
You have chores to do.

02:52.480 --> 02:54.560
Yes, sir.

02:54.640 --> 02:57.920
[Sighs]
He's so anxious...

02:58.000 --> 03:02.160
and so blind
to the dangers ahead.

03:03.120 --> 03:06.720
Look, cat. You're in luck.

03:06.800 --> 03:09.040
Just enough left for you.

03:10.600 --> 03:11.960
Hmm.

03:12.000 --> 03:15.280
- [ Quacking]
- Dallben doesn't understand.

03:16.520 --> 03:18.680
I'm not a little boy
anymore.

03:18.720 --> 03:21.920
[Squawking]

03:22.000 --> 03:27.680
I should be doing heroic deeds
for Prydain, not waiting
hand and foot on a spoiled--

03:27.720 --> 03:30.200
Hey!

03:30.280 --> 03:32.800
[Chuckles]
Oh, all right, Hen.

03:32.840 --> 03:35.200
I didn't mean it.

03:35.280 --> 03:37.280
You'd better eat it.

03:37.360 --> 03:39.920
Dallben made it
especially for you.

03:46.680 --> 03:50.560
Is this to be my life ?
Pampering a pig ?

03:50.640 --> 03:52.840
I'm a warrior
nota pig keeper.

03:52.920 --> 03:56.640
Dallben thinks I'd be afraid,
but I wouldn't.

03:56.680 --> 03:59.520
All I need is a chance,

03:59.560 --> 04:02.840
and I could be
a famous warrior.

04:02.880 --> 04:07.160
Look at me, Hen !
I can do it! Ha !

04:07.240 --> 04:09.560
[Squealing]

04:09.600 --> 04:11.720

04:11.800 --> 04:13.720
Even you're afraid.

04:13.800 --> 04:18.200
-[ Quacking]
-Do you challenge me ? Run, you cowards.

04:18.279 --> 04:21.760

04:23.200 --> 04:25.160
-There you are.
- [ Bleats]

04:25.240 --> 04:27.720
His Majesty,
the Horned King.

04:27.800 --> 04:30.680
So we meet at last.
Ha !

04:30.720 --> 04:34.400
[ Laughing] Even the Horned King
shakes with fear.

04:34.480 --> 04:38.360
See, Hen? Everybody runs
from the famous Taran of Caer Dallben !

04:40.400 --> 04:42.240
[ Laughing]

04:42.320 --> 04:44.440
[Groans, Coughing]

04:44.480 --> 04:47.480
Prydain's finest warrior...

04:47.560 --> 04:51.480
draws his last... breath.

04:59.840 --> 05:01.720
Dallben.

05:01.760 --> 05:06.360
Hmm, not quite the blade
for a hero.

05:06.400 --> 05:09.560
[Stammering] I was--
It's just that we were--

05:09.640 --> 05:11.960
Hen Wen got dirty.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.920
[ Dallben] Oh, I see.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.120
Another dream, Aran ?

05:17.200 --> 05:21.560
But, Dallben, won't I ever be anything
but an assistant pig keeper?

05:21.600 --> 05:23.640
She's a special pig, Taran.

05:23.680 --> 05:28.280
- [Snorting]
- [Chuckles]

05:28.320 --> 05:30.800
Now, give her a nice bath.

05:31.960 --> 05:34.760
Well, Hen,
it looks as though...

05:34.840 --> 05:39.000
I'll still be an assistant pig keeper
when I'm as old as Dallben.

05:40.600 --> 05:42.680
[ Laughs] You like that, don’t you ?

05:42.720 --> 05:46.200
[ Laughing] Now for the part
you like best.

05:55.720 --> 05:58.880
Hey, come on, Hen.
I haven’t finished scrubbing your ba--

05:58.920 --> 06:01.880
- [Squealing]
- Hen, what’s the matter?
Calm down, Hen.

06:01.960 --> 06:04.160
- [Continues Squealing]
-Stop it, please ! What's the matter?

06:04.200 --> 06:07.720
- Hen Wen--
-Taran, what's going on ?

06:07.800 --> 06:09.640
I-I don't know.

06:09.720 --> 06:11.560
There's something wrong
with Hen Wen.

06:11.640 --> 06:16.040
What? Quickly, lad.
Bring her inside.

06:23.960 --> 06:27.320
-[ Taran] What's that for?
- Put Hen Wen down.

06:27.400 --> 06:30.920
I never use her powers
unless I have to,

06:31.000 --> 06:32.840
but now I must.

06:32.920 --> 06:37.760
- ''Powers'' ?
-Taran, what you are about to see,

06:37.840 --> 06:41.720
you must never reveal to anyone.

06:42.920 --> 06:46.160
Hen Wen, from you,
I do beseech...

06:46.240 --> 06:49.840
knowledge that lies
beyond my reach,

06:49.920 --> 06:53.040
troubled thoughts
beyond your heart.

06:53.120 --> 06:57.040
Pray you now
those thoughts impart.

07:12.000 --> 07:16.640
[ Dallben Sighs] The Horned King.

07:18.160 --> 07:22.040
- [Gasps]
-Shh-shh-shh. Don't interfere.

07:23.520 --> 07:25.880
He is searching.

07:37.960 --> 07:41.360
The Black Cauldron !

07:41.440 --> 07:44.480
-So that's it.
- ''The Black Cauldron'' ?

07:44.520 --> 07:47.360
[ Dallben] An awesome weapon, Taran.

07:47.440 --> 07:49.600
It's been hidden
for centuries,

07:49.680 --> 07:52.000
but if the Horned King
should find it...

07:52.080 --> 07:54.080
and unleash its power,

07:54.160 --> 07:57.560
nothing could stand
against him.

07:57.600 --> 07:59.480
[ Taran] That's Hen Wen.

07:59.520 --> 08:01.400
[ Dallben] He knows.

08:01.440 --> 08:06.240
Stop ! Enough !
You must leave here at once.

08:06.320 --> 08:08.160
Take Hen Wen
to the hidden cottage...

08:08.240 --> 08:10.080
at the edge
of the forbidden forest.

08:10.160 --> 08:14.040
Hide there and never bring her out
until I come for you.

08:14.120 --> 08:16.600
''Hide'' ? But why?

08:16.680 --> 08:20.440
Only I knew the secret
of Hen Wen's power,

08:20.480 --> 08:24.160
but now the Horned King
has discovered it.

08:24.200 --> 08:28.960
We must make sure he never uses
it to find the Black Cauldron.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.240
I'm not afraid
of the Horned King.

08:31.320 --> 08:33.799
Then you are a very foolish lad.

08:33.880 --> 08:38.120
Untried courage is no match
for his evil.

08:38.200 --> 08:40.039
Just remember that.

08:40.120 --> 08:43.960
Now, off you go,
my boy,

08:44.000 --> 08:45.920
and take care
of yourself.

08:47.040 --> 08:48.960
Good-bye, Dallben.

08:49.920 --> 08:52.720
I won't fail you.

08:58.720 --> 09:02.520

to rest
on his young shoulders.

Oh, yes.

10:03.360 --> 10:07.480
Yes, my soldiers.

10:07.520 --> 10:11.720
Soon the Black Cauldron
will be mine.

10:11.800 --> 10:17.400
Its evil power will course
through my veins,

10:17.440 --> 10:22.680
and I shall make you...

10:22.720 --> 10:25.600

10:28.640 --> 10:31.320
Yes. Yes. Oh, yes.

10:31.360 --> 10:35.000
Then you will worship me!

10:39.800 --> 10:43.400
Oh, my soldiers.

10:43.480 --> 10:45.960

I have thirsted...

[ Taran] Gosh, Hen Wen.
I never knew...

11:02.360 --> 11:05.160
you could create visions
and things like that.

11:05.240 --> 11:07.320
I thought you were just
an ordinary pig.

11:08.760 --> 11:12.520
I had no idea
you were so... special.

11:12.600 --> 11:15.240
Dallben's going to be glad
that he put his trust in me.

11:15.320 --> 11:17.320
Just you wait and see.

11:17.400 --> 11:20.040
Now, don't go
wandering about.

11:20.120 --> 11:22.920
And don’t you worry.

will do you any harm.

Sire, look.
Something's wrong.

What is it, sire?
They're-They're dying!

01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:54.920
It can’t be.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:59.080
-This had better not be your fault.
- [Gasps]

01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:02.960

Perhaps it needs another body, sire.

01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:06.840
-Yes. Yours !
- [Gasping]

01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:15.080

- But, Taran, I-- Please, I--
-Go on ! Go with Fflewddur.

01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:24.360

Get up !
Come alive !

01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:53.840
Maybe they're only resting, sire.
[ Nervous Chuckle]

01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:58.480
Do something !
My life is at stake !

Look! Sire, look!

01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:06.320
It's the pig boy.

01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:08.800
It's his fault. Yes.

01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:11.120
He's the cause of it!

01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:14.640

[Crazy Laughter]
Go for his throat, sire.

01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:22.400
Now, pig keeper,
you shall die.

01:04:24.040 --> 01:04:27.000
No ! Don't!

What? What's this ?

01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:38.280
No, you’ll not escape.

01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:45.640
You shall satisfy
the Cauldron's hunger.

Yes. He's got
what he wanted,

01:08:29.880 --> 01:08:32.439
and he's still
not satisfied.

01:08:32.479 --> 01:08:36.279
Just what do you think
you're up to, ladies ?

01:08:36.319 --> 01:08:39.640
Oh, we have business
with your little hero.

Hero ? Gorge was the hero.

01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:47.960
The only thing that mattered
to you was the Cauldron,

01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:50.960
but now it's
no use to you.

01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:56.399
-So we'll just take it
and be on our way.

I'm a pig boy.

01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:53.640
What would I do
with a sword ?

01:09:53.720 --> 01:09:57.040
Absolutely nothing.
