00:13.504 --> 00:16.384
Hey, Mordecai, do me a solid and grab me a lemonade from the kitchen?

00:16.484 --> 00:17.474
Okay,

00:17.614 --> 00:18.994
but, you owe me a solid!

00:19.014 --> 00:20.844
Of course, that's how solids work.

00:28.514 --> 00:30.404
Do me a solid and change the channel?

00:30.404 --> 00:33.574
Do me a solid and pass the remote so I don't have to get so close to the commercial?

00:34.954 --> 00:37.024
Do me a solid and turn this comic book page?

00:37.024 --> 00:39.014
Do me a solid and dry my hands?

00:39.184 --> 00:40.894
Do me a solid and fluff this cushion?

00:40.894 --> 00:42.894
- Sharpen my pencil? - Fold these socks?

00:42.894 --> 00:44.524
Cheese these nachos?

00:49.664 --> 00:52.004
Mordecai, Rigby!

00:52.004 --> 00:53.254
Hey, Pops. Hey, Skips.

00:53.254 --> 00:55.884
Ya think ya want some chips with that cheese?

00:56.534 --> 00:59.244
Oh, yeah. I guess we over did it with the cheese, huh?

01:04.144 --> 01:07.554
Aren't you suppose to be working at the Snack Bar, today?

01:07.824 --> 01:09.284
Do us a solid and cover for us?

01:09.384 --> 01:12.014
You shouldn't abuse the power of the solid.

01:12.054 --> 01:13.854
Bad things will happen.

01:13.854 --> 01:15.594
Can you at least pretend you didn't see us?

01:15.594 --> 01:17.534
Oh, okay. But you owe me a solid.

01:19.114 --> 01:20.334
We should probably get out of here.

01:20.334 --> 01:22.274
Do me a solid and buy me a cup of coffee?

01:23.254 --> 01:24.694
Do me a solid and pull out my seat?

01:26.864 --> 01:29.904
Don't look now dude but Eileen is totally checking you out.

01:31.644 --> 01:33.864
I think she likes you.

01:33.864 --> 01:34.824
Shut it!

01:34.824 --> 01:38.144
You should go for it. You make a cute couple.

01:38.154 --> 01:39.584
STOP TALKING!

01:39.584 --> 01:41.684
Here's your chance. Dude, she's coming this way.

01:41.684 --> 01:43.214
Hey guys, here's your order.

01:43.334 --> 01:46.174
I triple dip your sandwich Rigby, just the way you like it.

01:46.174 --> 01:49.924
So Rigby, I was wondering, do you like Miniature Golf?

01:51.234 --> 01:52.074
Me too!

01:52.434 --> 01:54.444
You know, in an ironic way.

01:54.444 --> 01:56.724
My shift ends early tonight, you wanna go?

01:57.004 --> 01:59.524
Yeah Rigby, you wanna go?

02:00.004 --> 02:02.394
Yeah, I waxing my car tonight so..

02:02.394 --> 02:03.904
Oh, that's cool.

02:03.904 --> 02:05.834
I didn't mean it like a date or anything,

02:05.834 --> 02:06.984
it will be a group thing;

02:07.004 --> 02:09.514
you, me, Mordecai, and Margaret.

02:10.003 --> 02:12.754
But it's cool that you're busy, totally cool, totally,

02:12.814 --> 02:14.084
I get you a refill.

02:15.694 --> 02:17.364
Idiot, idiot.

02:18.224 --> 02:19.844
Why do we have to come on her shift?

02:19.884 --> 02:21.924
Dude, do me a solid and go out with Eileen

02:21.924 --> 02:23.314
so I can go on a date with Margaret.

02:23.374 --> 02:24.684
What? Why?

02:24.684 --> 02:27.764
Dude, come on. This is my chance to finally get with Margaret.

02:27.764 --> 02:29.194
No, I'm not doing it.

02:29.194 --> 02:31.344
What do you want? I do your work for a week.

02:31.344 --> 02:33.204
You can be player one on any video game.

02:33.204 --> 02:35.174
Dude, there's no way I'm going out with Eileen.

02:35.254 --> 02:38.184
Rigby, please! You have to do me this solid.

02:39.034 --> 02:41.924
Alright, I do it for 10 solids.

02:41.924 --> 02:43.654
What? That's ridiculous!

02:43.654 --> 02:44.754
Ok, that's cool.

02:44.754 --> 02:47.554
Then I guess you don't mind "Morde-crying" to sleep tonight,

02:47.554 --> 02:49.524
instead on going on a hot date with Margaret.

02:50.274 --> 02:52.294
Fine, I own you 10 solids.

02:52.294 --> 02:53.924
Then it's a date.

02:55.904 --> 02:56.834
I'm telling you dude,

02:56.834 --> 02:58.944
I'm gonna make my move tonight with Margaret.

02:58.994 --> 03:01.064
I'm gonna make my move!

03:01.064 --> 03:03.644
Yeah, making your way to total loser-dom.

03:03.694 --> 03:05.214
Rigby, be cool.

03:05.214 --> 03:06.654
Oh, I'll be cool alright,

03:06.654 --> 03:09.234
but I might have to use a solid or two to get though.

03:10.524 --> 03:12.664
Hi Rigby, you look nice.

03:12.664 --> 03:14.194
Oh, hey Eileen.

03:14.194 --> 03:16.414
I hope everyone's ready for an awesome night.

03:16.414 --> 03:18.834
I was hoping maybe after mini golf we can grab dinner,

03:18.834 --> 03:21.524
and maybe a late screening of Fat Heat.

03:21.564 --> 03:22.674
You guys like that movie?

03:22.674 --> 03:25.424
Wow Mordecai, you really figured out tonight's plans.

03:25.634 --> 03:28.704
Yeah, he wants to make it last, cause it will never happen again.

03:29.674 --> 03:32.574
Well, I guess we should go if we're gonna fit all that in.

03:34.054 --> 03:35.264
It should be unlocked.

03:37.304 --> 03:38.334
Hey, Mordecai?

03:38.524 --> 03:40.704
Can you do me a solid, and hang back with Eileen?

03:42.114 --> 03:43.174
Fine!

03:50.624 --> 03:52.184
Hey, Margaret check it out!

03:52.304 --> 03:54.754
I want to suck your blood.

03:54.864 --> 03:56.614
So red and juicy.

03:56.644 --> 03:58.584
Stay back!

03:58.674 --> 04:00.854
I've got a putter, and I'm not afraid to use it.

04:00.854 --> 04:02.414
Hey, Rigby, look at me!

04:02.414 --> 04:05.354
I just laid sea turtle eggs, and now I'm gonna swim out to sea.

04:05.404 --> 04:08.224
Although many of my hatchlings won't live till adulthood.

04:09.564 --> 04:10.974
Let's just get this over with.

04:13.524 --> 04:14.424
Hey, Mordecai.

04:16.923 --> 04:19.654
Do me a solid, and yell as loud as you can.

04:19.704 --> 04:20.803
What, why?

04:20.853 --> 04:22.394
You don't even get anything out of that.

04:22.394 --> 04:25.084
Cool, then we can call off this stupid date and go home.

04:25.164 --> 04:26.514
Okay, okay! I'll do it.

04:36.804 --> 04:38.954
Sorry about ruining your shot earlier, Margaret.

04:38.994 --> 04:40.524
Oh, it's no big deal.

04:40.574 --> 04:42.874
Yeah, especially since you beat us all.

04:42.934 --> 04:44.294
I had a lot of practice.

04:44.364 --> 04:46.294
My dad used to bring me here when I was little.

04:46.294 --> 04:49.314
Well, in honor of your big win, I made you a trophy.

04:52.514 --> 04:55.044
I'll tresure it for as long as it stays fresh.

04:58.964 --> 05:01.204
Congratulations on second place, Rigby!

05:03.464 --> 05:06.604
Mordecai, can you do me a solid and tell me if this burrito tastes fishy?

05:13.494 --> 05:15.174
Dude, what did you put in that?

05:15.994 --> 05:18.134
Oh, wow. Sorry Margaret.

05:18.654 --> 05:21.324
It's okay! I didn't like this top, anyway.

05:25.074 --> 05:27.044
Can you do me a solid and get some popcorn?

05:27.044 --> 05:28.314
I'm all out of money!

05:32.224 --> 05:34.554
Hey Margaret, can I borrow five bucks?

05:34.634 --> 05:37.594
- Sure, Mordecai. - Thank you.

00:00.644 --> 00:00.644
Line 1

00:00.644 --> 00:00.644
Line 2

00:00.644 --> 00:00.644
Line 3

00:00.644 --> 00:00.644
Line 4

00:00.644 --> 00:00.644
Line 5

00:00.644 --> 00:00.644
Line 6

05:49.514 --> 05:51.874
Hey, do me a solid and get some butter up in this.

05:55.894 --> 05:56.724
Here.

00:00.644 --> 00:00.644
Line 7

05:56.764 --> 05:56.804
Line 8

06:05.484 --> 06:07.394
Dude, my hands are all slick from the butter.

06:07.394 --> 06:08.954
Do me a solid and get some napkins.

06:09.104 --> 06:10.874
You mean these napkins?

06:12.334 --> 06:13.524
In your face!

06:13.524 --> 06:15.934
Someone just wasted their sixth solid!

06:17.674 --> 06:19.834
Hey, do me a solid and take the heat from this.

06:19.834 --> 06:21.034
Take the heat from what?

06:25.024 --> 06:27.284
Sorry, sorry everybody.

06:30.404 --> 06:31.734
This is where you live?

06:33.114 --> 06:35.454
Yeah. Make yourself at home.

06:37.954 --> 06:41.424
Man, I don't know about you guys, but I can go for some dessert.

06:41.524 --> 06:42.304
Mordecai?

06:42.394 --> 06:43.624
Yes, Rigby?

06:43.624 --> 06:46.174
Can you do me a solid and get some Ice Cream Sandwiches?

06:47.424 --> 06:50.514
Make it a double solid, and get the good ones from the Snack Bar.

06:50.574 --> 06:51.984
I'll be right back.

06:54.074 --> 06:55.704
Do you have any board games?

06:59.584 --> 07:01.064
Alright, I brought them.

07:01.064 --> 07:03.164
It's about time.

07:03.164 --> 07:06.124
Why are Muscle Man and  Hi-Five Ghost here?

07:06.264 --> 07:09.884
Rigby said there were icecream sandwiches at this party.

07:09.884 --> 07:11.154
Hook it up!

07:11.934 --> 07:14.174
Hey ladies, you want some of this?

07:15.704 --> 07:18.334
It's getting pretty late. I think I'm gonna go home.

07:18.484 --> 07:20.994
What? No, the night's still young!

07:21.024 --> 07:22.564
Can't you hang out a litte longer?

07:22.564 --> 07:23.514
Yeah, Margaret!

07:23.514 --> 07:26.044
We haven't even eaten our icecream sandwiches yet.

07:26.124 --> 07:28.244
They're the premium kind.

07:28.564 --> 07:29.344
Alright.

07:29.484 --> 07:30.054
Great!

07:30.194 --> 07:32.674
Rigby, can I see you in the kitchen for a second?

07:32.674 --> 07:33.424
What for?

07:34.054 --> 07:35.004
Ok!

07:35.024 --> 07:36.354
We'll be right back.

07:37.004 --> 07:38.614
Awkward.

07:40.514 --> 07:42.854
Why are you using your solids to ruin my date with Margaret?

07:42.854 --> 07:45.014
Why'd you use your solid to ruin my life?

07:45.704 --> 07:47.284
Quit being a baby!

07:47.284 --> 07:47.974
Watch it!

07:47.974 --> 07:50.914
You don't wanna mess with someone who still has one solid left.

07:50.914 --> 07:55.064
Hey ladies, watch what else I can do with my Icecream Sandwich!

07:55.064 --> 07:55.974
Mordecai,

07:56.254 --> 07:57.874
I think I'm gonna go soon.

07:57.874 --> 08:00.334
Fine! Just use your last solid and get it over with.

08:00.334 --> 08:01.884
I don't want Margaret to leave.

08:01.884 --> 08:03.174
Okay,

08:03.534 --> 08:05.424
can you do me a solid and...

08:07.574 --> 08:10.584
No, no way! I'm not doing that!

08:12.434 --> 08:14.334
You have to, it's a solid!

08:14.334 --> 08:16.114
You're insane! I'm not doing it!

08:17.964 --> 08:20.964
Hey Margaret, wanna check out my record collection before you go?

08:20.964 --> 08:23.524
- I don't-- - Yeah Margaret, you love music.

08:23.654 --> 08:25.084
I'll stay down here with Rigby.

08:25.084 --> 08:25.964
Okay.

08:26.024 --> 08:28.124
- Mordecai! - Just ignore him.

08:30.274 --> 08:31.154
What was that?

08:31.374 --> 08:34.183
- You better do it! - Lay off, Rigby!

08:38.914 --> 08:40.514
What's happening?

08:40.514 --> 08:41.474
Rigby!

08:42.344 --> 08:44.584
It's because you didn't do the solid!

08:44.624 --> 08:45.954
Do the solid!

08:45.954 --> 08:46.734
No!

08:50.694 --> 08:52.214
Do it, ir we're gonna die!

08:53.604 --> 08:55.734
I don't care. I'm not doing it.

08:55.734 --> 08:56.734
You have to!

08:57.074 --> 08:58.564
What are you two doing?!

08:58.864 --> 09:01.904
I told you not to abuse the solids!

09:01.904 --> 09:03.734
It wasn't me! It was Rigby!

09:03.734 --> 09:06.404
He asked me to do one that was worth like 10 solids!

09:06.404 --> 09:07.464
What was it?

09:08.684 --> 09:10.514
Whoa, that's crazy.

09:10.514 --> 09:12.914
But he's gotta do it! It's a solid!

09:12.914 --> 09:15.414
Do us a solid and do your solid!

09:15.414 --> 09:17.324
No! No way!

09:17.464 --> 09:19.684
Just do it already, Mordecai!

09:19.684 --> 09:21.474
But you'll never respect me again!

09:21.544 --> 09:23.704
Not if you're just doing a solid!

09:23.704 --> 09:25.354
That's what friends are for!

09:25.354 --> 09:27.794
They come through for each other where they need it most!

09:27.794 --> 09:30.514
Wow, I guess I never thought of it that way before.

09:30.514 --> 09:33.074
Margaret does solids for me all the time.

09:33.324 --> 09:37.304
Yeah! Like tonight I broke a date so Eileen could go out with Rigby!

09:37.354 --> 09:40.534
Wait, you're only here because you're doing Eileen a solid?

09:42.744 --> 09:45.044
We're really gonna die if you don't do me that solid.

09:46.514 --> 09:47.984
Fine, you win.

09:48.374 --> 09:49.314
I'll do it.

09:54.174 --> 09:56.184
Oh no, bro.

09:59.464 --> 10:05.234
Ok shh, shh. Here it comes in 5, 4, 3, 2...

10:05.234 --> 10:06.334
Honk, honk.

10:09.094 --> 10:10.994
You're watching it again?

10:10.994 --> 10:13.074
This is a new version I edited together.

10:13.154 --> 10:14.184
Dude, come over here!

10:14.184 --> 10:17.124
You've gotta see the look on your face, it's the best part!

10:18.194 --> 10:19.624
Classic!

10:19.624 --> 10:21.784
You know what, Rigby? You're a jerk!

10:21.864 --> 10:23.444
Have fun with your little tape.

10:23.444 --> 10:24.634
I'm going to the arcade.

10:24.674 --> 10:27.174
Aw, come on, Mordecai! Don't be like that.

10:27.174 --> 10:28.134
I'll come with you.

10:28.264 --> 10:30.614
No way! I'm done hanging out with you.

10:30.614 --> 10:32.934
You're not my friend. I'm outta here.

10:32.934 --> 10:33.864
Mordecai, wait!

10:33.974 --> 10:36.584
I almost forgot! I still owe you that solid.

10:36.584 --> 10:37.534
What solid?

10:37.784 --> 10:39.214
What are you talking about?

10:39.214 --> 10:40.684
That solid, remember?

10:40.684 --> 10:42.524
The one where you told me to destroy the tape.

10:42.554 --> 10:44.964
- Huh? - Yeah. I was just about to do it.

10:46.444 --> 10:47.864
I hope there's no hard feelings.

10:48.504 --> 10:51.504
Aw man?! What is wrong with you?!

10:51.564 --> 10:53.584
Sorry, guys. A soild's a solid.

10:53.584 --> 10:56.374
- Aw, what? Come on! - Oh, well. I suppose it's true.

10:56.894 --> 10:58.134
- Hey Rigby? - Yeah?

10:58.274 --> 11:00.324
Do me a solid and come to the arcade with me?
