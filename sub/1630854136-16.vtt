You know, what did you
call him, a selfish prick?

11:40.264 --> 11:41.962
- And an arrogant boomer.

11:42.005 --> 11:43.528
And we know
that Ackerman wanted

11:43.572 --> 11:46.531
to pull the plug on the deal,
and that made you furious.

11:47.489 --> 11:50.492
- So I shot off a bunch
of angry text messages.

11:50.535 --> 11:51.798
We needed that deal.

11:51.841 --> 11:53.147
- So why did Ackerman
try to tank it?

11:53.190 --> 11:54.888
- Because he's a purist.

11:54.931 --> 11:56.672
When Jacob heard
that the buyer wanted

11:56.716 --> 11:59.022
to skew our coverage
to the far left,

11:59.066 --> 12:03.418
reposition us as the
liberal "Fox News," he balked.

12:03.461 --> 12:04.811
- But the good news for you is,

12:04.854 --> 12:06.290
now that Ackerman
is out of the picture,

12:06.334 --> 12:09.337
you're free to do whatever
you want with the company.

12:09.380 --> 12:10.991
- I didn't kill Jacob.

12:11.034 --> 12:12.688
- Just the same, where
were you yesterday morning?

12:12.732 --> 12:14.951
- At home with my family.

12:17.432 --> 12:20.174
It was my son's birthday.

12:22.045 --> 12:23.568
- All right.

12:23.612 --> 12:25.570
Can you think of anyone else

12:25.614 --> 12:27.790
that might have a problem
with Ackerman?

12:27.834 --> 12:28.965
Any confrontations?

12:29.009 --> 12:30.967
Any threats
that you know about?

12:31.011 --> 12:33.274
- He has been a little
distracted the past few weeks.

12:33.317 --> 12:35.102
- 'Cause of all the hate
he's getting online?

12:35.145 --> 12:37.626
- Because he was spending a lot
of time with a younger woman.

12:39.628 --> 12:43.066
- Jacob and I
were close for years.

12:43.110 --> 12:46.766
He was the first person to
hire me right out of college.

12:46.809 --> 12:48.202
He was my mentor.

12:48.245 --> 12:49.725
- I understand you were
spending a lot of time

12:49.769 --> 12:51.205
with him lately.
- Yeah.

12:51.248 --> 12:53.816
We were working together
on an article.

12:53.860 --> 12:56.297
- So your relationship
was strictly professional?

12:56.340 --> 12:57.951
- Yes, absolutely.

12:57.994 --> 12:59.996
- What were you two working on?

13:00.040 --> 13:02.694
- Something really big.
- Big how?

13:02.738 --> 13:04.609
- A few months ago,
six people died

13:04.653 --> 13:06.829
in a fire
in the Myers-Hamilton House.

13:06.873 --> 13:08.962
It's a public housing project.
- I remember that.

13:09.005 --> 13:12.226
The fire doors didn't deploy
like they should have, right?

13:12.269 --> 13:14.054
- And the official story

13:14.097 --> 13:15.882
is that the fire doors
didn't activate

13:15.925 --> 13:17.709
because
of a mechanical malfunction.

13:17.753 --> 13:19.233
- But the unofficial story?

13:21.626 --> 13:23.280
Apparently, Ackerman uncovered

13:23.324 --> 13:25.630
that the fire doors
at the housing project

13:25.674 --> 13:26.806
were supposed to be serviced

13:26.849 --> 13:28.590
two months
before the fire broke out,

13:28.633 --> 13:30.070
but that didn't happen

13:30.113 --> 13:32.550
because the contractor
the city paid to do the work,

13:32.594 --> 13:35.510
a company called SiteShield,
doesn't actually exist.

13:35.553 --> 13:37.164
- What do you mean
it doesn't exist?

13:37.207 --> 13:38.600
- Phony address.

13:38.643 --> 13:41.211
The phone number listed
is to a florist in Queens.

13:41.255 --> 13:43.605
$5 million was paid out
of a city budget

13:43.648 --> 13:45.085
to a shell corporation.

13:45.128 --> 13:48.610
- Meaning someone's
embezzling millions of dollars.

13:48.653 --> 13:50.960
And as a result,
six people burn alive?

13:51.004 --> 13:53.876
- Yeah.

13:53.920 --> 13:57.097
- What if Ackerman
was getting close

13:57.140 --> 13:59.795
to figuring out
who was behind the embezzling?

13:59.839 --> 14:00.927
- Hell of a motive.

14:00.970 --> 14:02.798
- And this reporter,

14:02.842 --> 14:04.800
McAllister,
she know who's involved?

14:04.844 --> 14:07.324
- She said that Ackerman
traced the money trail

14:07.368 --> 14:10.414
back
to Patricia Simonian's office,

14:10.458 --> 14:13.417
but she has no proof that
she was personally involved.

14:13.461 --> 14:16.420
- Patricia Simonian?
As in the deputy mayor?

14:16.464 --> 14:19.989
- Yeah, she hands out
the city contracts.

14:22.426 --> 14:24.298
- Just got off the phone
with Simonian's assistant.

14:24.341 --> 14:27.257
She hasn't been able
to reach her since Saturday--

14:27.301 --> 14:30.391
the day
before Ackerman was murdered.

14:30.434 --> 14:31.566
- All right, guys.

14:31.609 --> 14:33.046
You got to find her.

14:37.702 --> 14:39.748
[knocks at door]
- NYPD!

14:41.837 --> 14:43.839
NYPD!

14:43.883 --> 14:47.321
[door unlocks]

14:47.364 --> 14:49.018
NYPD!

14:52.282 --> 14:54.023
Police!

14:56.373 --> 14:57.809
- Frank.

14:57.853 --> 15:01.074
- [sighs] Yeah.

15:12.259 --> 15:12.650
.

15:12.694 --> 15:14.783
- Neighbors don't report seeing
or hearing anything unusual

15:14.826 --> 15:16.219
the past few days.

15:16.263 --> 15:17.655
Didn't see anyone coming
or going from the apartment.

15:17.699 --> 15:19.048
- Well, I did see a camera
in the lobby.

15:19.092 --> 15:20.354
Check
with the building manager.

15:20.397 --> 15:21.964
Have him pull footage
from the last four days.

15:22.008 --> 15:24.097
Thanks.

15:24.140 --> 15:26.055
- No sign of a break-in.

15:26.099 --> 15:29.015
- So there's a chance
she knew her killer.

15:29.058 --> 15:30.973
What you got?
- Cause of death

15:31.017 --> 15:32.627
appears
to be blunt force trauma.

15:32.670 --> 15:34.977
Something heavy.
Multiple blows to the head.

15:35.021 --> 15:36.631
- Obviously,
she's been dead a while,

15:36.674 --> 15:38.502
but any estimate
on exactly how long?

15:38.546 --> 15:40.069
- It's been a couple days.

15:40.113 --> 15:42.158
I mean, based on the signs
of putrefaction I'm seeing,

15:42.202 --> 15:45.727
I'd say sometime late Saturday
night or early Sunday morning.

15:45.770 --> 15:47.685
- That was
before Ackerman was killed.

15:47.729 --> 15:49.252
Are you confirming
that she was killed

15:49.296 --> 15:51.211
sometime
before 6:00 a.m. Sunday?

15:51.254 --> 15:52.995
- She's definitely been here
longer than that.

15:53.039 --> 15:55.650
- Well, that rules her out
as Ackerman's killer.

15:55.693 --> 15:57.478
These two murders
have to be connected.

15:57.521 --> 16:01.134
- So Ackerman's investigating
the embezzlement of city funds,

16:01.177 --> 16:04.311
and he suspects the
deputy mayor of being involved.

16:04.354 --> 16:07.662
And then, somehow they both
end up murdered hours apart.

16:07.705 --> 16:10.317
- Odds of this
being a coincidence?

16:10.360 --> 16:12.623
- Zero.

16:12.667 --> 16:15.104
- This is video
from Simonian's lobby

16:15.148 --> 16:17.411
at 11:07 p.m.,
Saturday night.

16:17.454 --> 16:18.716
- Oh, she let him in.

16:18.760 --> 16:20.588
Look at their body language.
She knows him.

16:20.631 --> 16:23.765
- Look at that jacket,
height, build.

16:23.808 --> 16:25.636
The guy matches the description

16:25.680 --> 16:27.899
of the suspect
from the Ackerman crime scene.

16:27.943 --> 16:31.555
- Half an hour later,
the same person leaves alone.

16:31.599 --> 16:34.558
And look,
he's clearly holding something.

16:34.602 --> 16:36.604
- Likely the murder weapon.

16:36.647 --> 16:40.129
- OK, so this confirms

16:40.173 --> 16:43.045
we're looking for one killer
for both homicides.

16:43.089 --> 16:47.006
And the question is, who's got
motive to murder both victims?

16:47.049 --> 16:50.357
- Ackerman
was investigating SiteShield.

16:50.400 --> 16:53.360
- And Simonian is the one who
approved the city-wide contract

16:53.403 --> 16:55.101
for SiteShield.

16:55.144 --> 16:58.582
- Julia McAllister was working
on the article with Ackerman.

16:58.626 --> 17:00.845
If the killer knows that...

17:00.889 --> 17:04.153
- OK, let's get her
into protective custody ASAP.

17:08.114 --> 17:09.723
[door opens]

17:11.421 --> 17:15.556
- We'll have an officer posted
outside the door at all times

17:15.598 --> 17:18.689
and two officers
in a patrol car outside.

17:18.733 --> 17:20.256
- How long
do I have to stay here?

17:20.300 --> 17:21.910
- Until we find out
who's responsible

17:21.953 --> 17:23.867
for the embezzlement.

17:23.912 --> 17:25.695
- Whoever it is,
they're murdering

17:25.740 --> 17:28.221
anyone they think
is connected to you,

17:28.263 --> 17:29.961
which puts you in danger.

17:30.962 --> 17:32.486
- I need to check on someone.

17:32.529 --> 17:34.227
- Who might that be?

17:34.270 --> 17:36.229
- When Jacob figured out
that the deputy mayor

17:36.272 --> 17:38.274
might somehow be involved
with SiteShield,

17:38.318 --> 17:40.189
I gave him the contact info

17:40.233 --> 17:42.409
of someone I thought
might have some information,

17:42.452 --> 17:44.237
someone who had
come through for me before.

17:44.280 --> 17:46.761
- And why didn't you tell us
this yesterday when we spoke?

17:46.804 --> 17:48.371
- I was protecting my source.

17:48.415 --> 17:51.679
And I wasn't even sure if
Jacob had connected with them.

17:51.722 --> 17:53.942
- If you tell us who they are--
- No.

17:53.985 --> 17:57.772
They are an anonymous source.
That's the whole point.

17:57.815 --> 18:01.863
Please,
just let me make a call,

18:01.906 --> 18:04.866
and I'll find out
who was behind SiteShield.

18:11.438 --> 18:14.005
- So that's our embezzler.

18:19.228 --> 18:20.838
[engine starts]

18:25.582 --> 18:26.627
- Looks like
he's heading north.

18:26.670 --> 18:28.150
The 278 onramp's up ahead.

18:28.194 --> 18:30.109
He could be
making a run for it.

18:41.076 --> 18:43.209
That looked like
a rolling stop to me.

18:43.252 --> 18:46.168
[sirens blaring]

19:12.673 --> 19:13.848
License and registration,
please.

19:13.891 --> 19:15.197
- What did I do?

19:15.241 --> 19:17.417
- You rolled
through that stop sign, sir.

19:17.460 --> 19:18.853
License and registration.

19:18.896 --> 19:21.334
- What are you--
- Please. Now.

19:21.377 --> 19:24.859
That's quite a shiner
you got there, uh, Mr. Costa.

19:24.902 --> 19:27.688
How'd you get that?
- Excuse me?

19:27.731 --> 19:29.080
- Simple enough question.

19:29.124 --> 19:31.213
- [scoffs]
What the hell's going on here?

19:31.257 --> 19:34.216
- Step out of the vehicle.
- What?

19:35.957 --> 19:38.829
- Step out
of the vehicle now, sir.

19:42.746 --> 19:44.270
Hands on the roof.

19:48.535 --> 19:50.450
[handcuffs clicking]

19:50.493 --> 19:53.366
- I have no idea
what you're talking about.

19:53.409 --> 19:54.758
- Don't lie to us, David.

19:54.802 --> 19:57.979
We know
you embezzled city money

19:58.022 --> 20:00.895
and that you got into an
argument with Patricia Simonian

20:00.938 --> 20:02.070
two days
before she was murdered.

20:02.113 --> 20:03.332
- And unfortunately for you,

20:03.376 --> 20:05.552
a third party
overheard that conversation.

20:05.595 --> 20:08.729
- We know that you're
the one behind SiteShield,

20:08.772 --> 20:10.252
and that makes you responsible

20:10.296 --> 20:11.819
for the six people
who died in that fire.

20:11.862 --> 20:14.474
- I've never even
heard of that company.

20:14.517 --> 20:16.389
- Jacob Ackerman contacted

20:16.432 --> 20:18.739
the deputy mayor
Saturday afternoon.

20:18.782 --> 20:20.262
And she got spooked

20:20.306 --> 20:22.090
that a reporter
was poking around, didn't she?

20:22.133 --> 20:24.092
- And you realized
that she was a liability.

20:24.135 --> 20:25.833
So you went over
to her place that night,

20:25.876 --> 20:27.574
and you killed her.

20:27.617 --> 20:29.402
- And then you went to
Ackerman's to finish the job.

20:29.445 --> 20:31.230
But he put up a fight,
didn't he?

20:32.405 --> 20:33.754
- I'm not gonna say
another word

20:33.797 --> 20:35.364
until my attorney gets here.

20:35.408 --> 20:37.323
[knocks at door]

20:37.366 --> 20:38.454
- That's fine, Dave.

20:38.498 --> 20:39.847
Because you know
what that sound means?

20:39.890 --> 20:41.892
It's the signal
that we got our search warrant.

20:43.807 --> 20:46.593
[police radio chatter]

20:46.636 --> 20:49.378
Find anything?

20:49.422 --> 20:51.032
- No green jacket.

20:54.862 --> 20:56.603
- You got to be kidding me.

20:56.646 --> 20:59.127
- About?

20:59.170 --> 21:00.433
- It's right out in the open.

21:00.476 --> 21:02.348
- No way.

21:02.391 --> 21:04.393
[whistles]

21:04.437 --> 21:06.265
- Third from the top.

21:15.709 --> 21:18.581
- He can't be that stupid.

21:18.625 --> 21:20.017
Come on.

21:21.758 --> 21:23.020
- There.

21:23.064 --> 21:25.022
It's faint,
but it's definitely blood.

21:27.373 --> 21:28.287
- Wow.

21:32.987 --> 21:33.204
.

21:33.248 --> 21:35.946
- David Costa
and Deputy Mayor Simonian

21:35.990 --> 21:38.209
were co-conspirators
in an embezzlement scheme

21:38.253 --> 21:40.211
that led directly
to the deaths of six people

21:40.255 --> 21:42.083
in a public housing unit fire.

21:42.126 --> 21:44.433
- And Jacob Ackerman
was working on an article

21:44.477 --> 21:46.087
that would have
exposed their crimes,

21:46.130 --> 21:49.177
so Costa killed Ackerman
and the deputy mayor

21:49.220 --> 21:51.397
to keep the truth
from being discovered.

21:51.440 --> 21:53.877
- And you have evidence
to back this up?

21:53.921 --> 21:56.489
- DNA tests confirm
that blood on the knife

21:56.532 --> 21:59.056
found at David Costa's home
belongs to Ackerman.

21:59.100 --> 22:01.537
- And while they didn't
find a jacket or hat

22:01.581 --> 22:04.061
that matches the description
of our witness,

22:04.105 --> 22:06.673
they did find this
on Costa's social media.

22:06.716 --> 22:09.545
It's the same jacket
from the surveillance footage.

22:09.589 --> 22:11.330
- You can prove motive, means,

22:11.373 --> 22:12.809
and you've got him
in possession

22:12.853 --> 22:14.463
of the murder weapon.
What's the problem?

22:14.507 --> 22:16.813
- Well, our evidence
in the Ackerman case is strong.

22:16.857 --> 22:19.250
but we don't have much,
if anything,

22:19.294 --> 22:21.078
tying him to Simonian's murder.

22:21.122 --> 22:23.472
- Then separate the cases.
[phone buzzes]

22:23.516 --> 22:26.257
Hold off on Simonian's
until you have more evidence.

22:26.301 --> 22:29.522
And in the meantime, move
for trial on the Ackerman case.

22:29.565 --> 22:32.351
- Costa's attorney
just filed a motion.

22:33.569 --> 22:36.224
They want to suppress
the murder weapon.

22:38.748 --> 22:41.403
- It's our contention that
the search warrant in this case

22:41.447 --> 22:43.362
was defective.

22:43.405 --> 22:45.102
- Mr. Price,
what was the basis

22:45.146 --> 22:46.974
for probable cause
in your affidavit?

22:47.017 --> 22:48.541
- The defendant
has a clear motive,

22:48.584 --> 22:51.761
and detectives observed
cuts and bruises on his face

22:51.805 --> 22:53.502
during a routine traffic stop.

22:53.546 --> 22:56.287
- Ah, yes, two seasoned
homicide detectives

22:56.331 --> 22:59.116
suddenly morph
into traffic cops.

22:59.160 --> 23:00.988
They pulled him over
for a rolling stop.

23:01.031 --> 23:02.685
This is laughable.

23:02.729 --> 23:05.340
The police circumvented my
client's constitutional rights

23:05.384 --> 23:08.082
with a trumped-up,
unverifiable,

23:08.125 --> 23:09.779
alleged traffic violation.

23:09.823 --> 23:11.128
- They were
within their rights.

23:11.172 --> 23:13.000
- No, they exploited
a technicality

23:13.043 --> 23:15.524
and violated
the spirit of the law.

23:15.568 --> 23:18.484
- I tend to agree.
It's an overreach.

23:20.181 --> 23:21.835
And since the stop
is where they noticed

23:21.878 --> 23:25.186
the cuts and bruises which in
turn led to the search warrant,

23:25.229 --> 23:27.928
the knife is fruit
of the poisonous tree.

23:27.971 --> 23:30.539
Defense's motion to suppress
is granted.

23:34.195 --> 23:35.631
- You been able
to find anything

23:35.675 --> 23:37.894
in Costa's personal finances
that ties him

23:37.938 --> 23:39.548
to the embezzlement?
- Negative.

23:39.592 --> 23:41.855
And I've requested information
on SiteShield's account,

23:41.898 --> 23:45.511
but the bank in Panama where
the company receives the funds

23:45.554 --> 23:48.339
is citing
the privacy of their clients.

23:48.383 --> 23:51.212
And we have no jurisdiction
to challenge it.

23:51.255 --> 23:53.867
- Which is why Costa was
funneling the embezzled funds

23:53.910 --> 23:55.390
through them
in the first place.

23:57.131 --> 24:00.134
You lost the murder weapon.

24:00.177 --> 24:02.353
This was supposed to be
the case you could win.

24:02.397 --> 24:03.616
- I still can.

24:03.659 --> 24:05.226
Ackerman was on the verge

24:05.269 --> 24:07.576
of exposing
SiteShield's responsibility

24:07.620 --> 24:09.926
for the six deaths
in the Myers-Hamilton fire.

24:09.970 --> 24:12.102
And as the person
behind the shell company,

24:12.146 --> 24:13.843
David Costa
had the most to lose.

24:13.887 --> 24:15.497
- Without documentation

24:15.541 --> 24:17.934
tying Costa
to the shell corporation,

24:17.978 --> 24:19.632
you can't even prove
he was involved

24:19.675 --> 24:20.937
in the embezzlement scheme.

24:20.981 --> 24:23.505
- I can do it
through Julia McAllister,

24:23.549 --> 24:25.028
Ackerman's colleague.

24:25.072 --> 24:26.508
She was writing the article
with Ackerman.

24:26.552 --> 24:29.293
She can testify to
how he came to suspect Costa.

24:29.337 --> 24:30.730
- Good.

24:30.773 --> 24:33.907
But you still need to play
to the jury's emotions.

24:33.950 --> 24:36.387
Remind them that
the defendant has a lot more

24:36.431 --> 24:38.912
than just Jacob Ackerman's
blood on his hands.

24:46.702 --> 24:49.575
- This was not an accident.

24:49.618 --> 24:54.536
What happened to the people
in that building was horrific--

24:54.580 --> 24:56.233
to be burned alive.

24:56.277 --> 25:00.629
And the tragedy is their deaths
could have been avoided.

25:01.500 --> 25:04.894
- Ms. McAllister, what did
you and Jacob Ackerman discover

25:04.938 --> 25:07.941
in the course of your reporting
on the Myers-Hamilton fire?

25:07.984 --> 25:10.160
- The city hired a company
called SiteShield

25:10.204 --> 25:12.554
to install fire safety doors
in that building.

25:12.598 --> 25:14.556
Turned out
it was a shell corporation,

25:14.600 --> 25:17.559
and they never did the work
they were paid to do.

25:17.603 --> 25:20.083
- How much were they paid?
- Over $5 million.

25:20.127 --> 25:21.650
- And were you able
to determine

25:21.694 --> 25:23.304
who was behind SiteShield?

25:23.347 --> 25:25.001
- Yes, I found a source

25:25.045 --> 25:26.916
who had firsthand knowledge
of the situation.

25:26.960 --> 25:28.570
- And what did the source
tell you?

25:28.614 --> 25:30.920
- Objection.
Calls for hearsay.

25:30.964 --> 25:32.487
- May I be heard?

25:32.531 --> 25:34.445
- I'll see counsel in chambers.

25:36.491 --> 25:38.711
Where are you going with this,
Mr. Price?

25:38.754 --> 25:41.235
- The witness will testify
that she has a source

25:41.278 --> 25:43.280
who told her that
they overheard a conversation--

25:43.324 --> 25:45.282
- This is hearsay.
- Hold on.

25:45.326 --> 25:46.588
What is
the proffered testimony?

25:46.632 --> 25:48.590
- The witness' source
overheard a conversation

25:48.634 --> 25:51.593
between the defendant and
Deputy Mayor Patricia Simonian.

25:51.637 --> 25:54.074
The defendant admitted
that he was behind SiteShield

25:54.117 --> 25:55.466
and that he was aware

25:55.510 --> 25:57.294
that Jacob Ackerman
was about to expose him.

25:57.338 --> 25:58.992
- I agree with Mr. Hollins.

25:59.035 --> 26:01.298
- It's an admission of guilt

26:01.342 --> 26:02.430
by the defendant...
- Actually, Your Honor...

26:02.473 --> 26:03.474
- And therefore,
an exception to the--

26:03.518 --> 26:05.302
- This is double hearsay.
- Double?

26:05.346 --> 26:06.826
- McAllister isn't even the one

26:06.869 --> 26:09.219
who claims to have overheard
this so-called confession.

26:09.263 --> 26:11.787
We have no proof
this source even exists.

26:11.831 --> 26:14.311
- Can you verify
who Ms. McAllister's source is?

26:14.355 --> 26:16.618
- Unfortunately,
no, Your Honor.

26:16.662 --> 26:19.186
The source only agreed
to speak with Ms. McAllister

26:19.229 --> 26:20.535
under the promise of anonymity,

26:20.579 --> 26:22.972
and she's exercising
her First Amendment right

26:23.016 --> 26:25.540
to protect their identity.

26:25.584 --> 26:27.455
- I understand
that puts you in a bind,

26:27.498 --> 26:30.545
but I need confirmation
this person is real.

26:30.589 --> 26:33.592
Without that, I can't allow
Ms. McAllister's testimony.

26:42.688 --> 26:44.646
- I need the name
of your source.

26:44.690 --> 26:47.736
I will do everything I can
to limit their exposure.

26:47.780 --> 26:49.999
- And we can request
a closed-door hearing.

26:50.043 --> 26:52.393
- I can't.
I'm sorry.

26:54.221 --> 26:56.832
- Ackerman was your friend,
right?

26:56.876 --> 26:59.269
Your mentor.

26:59.313 --> 27:01.489
And you're OK
letting his killer walk free?

27:01.532 --> 27:05.101
- No, I'm not OK with that.

27:05.145 --> 27:06.929
Not even close.

27:06.973 --> 27:09.018
But I can't reveal my source.

27:09.062 --> 27:12.326
I-I just can't.

27:13.544 --> 27:16.025
Jacob would understand too.

27:16.069 --> 27:20.639
He's the one who taught me
the importance of integrity.

27:20.682 --> 27:23.903
You live and die
as a journalist

27:23.946 --> 27:25.774
based on your word.

27:27.602 --> 27:29.691
I'm sorry.

27:29.735 --> 27:32.128
I can't help you.

27:40.441 --> 27:40.659
.

27:40.702 --> 27:42.791
- Can you describe
the person you saw

27:42.835 --> 27:44.706
running away
from Jacob Ackerman's home

27:44.750 --> 27:46.665
on the morning
of January 8th?

27:46.708 --> 27:49.711
- He was wearing
this big, green puffy jacket.

27:49.755 --> 27:52.105
- Was there anything unique
about the jacket?

27:52.148 --> 27:55.804
- It had a bright, fluorescent
orange liner and hood.

27:55.848 --> 28:01.636
- Mr. Fulcher, this is
a picture of David Costa

28:01.680 --> 28:03.072
taken a week before the murder.

28:03.116 --> 28:04.987
Is the jacket
he's wearing in this photo

28:05.031 --> 28:06.728
the same
as the one you're describing?

28:06.772 --> 28:09.513
- Yes, that's it.
No question.

28:11.385 --> 28:12.691
- Thank you.
Nothing further.

28:15.432 --> 28:19.088
- Mr. Fulcher,
by your own admission,

28:19.132 --> 28:22.135
you never saw
this person's face, correct?

28:22.178 --> 28:23.702
- Yes, that is correct.

28:23.745 --> 28:25.399
- In fact,
you told police

28:25.442 --> 28:28.489
that you couldn't even tell
if the person that you saw

28:28.532 --> 28:30.012
was a man or a woman.

28:30.056 --> 28:32.101
- That's true.

28:32.145 --> 28:37.411
- So what you saw was
a person in a ski jacket

28:37.454 --> 28:39.108
running down the street.

28:39.152 --> 28:42.633
- He or she was running out of
Jacob's home wearing that coat.

28:44.070 --> 28:49.510
- But what you can't say
beyond a reasonable doubt

28:49.553 --> 28:52.556
is that my client...

28:54.428 --> 28:56.735
Had anything to do
with this murder.

28:58.737 --> 29:02.088
- No, I guess not.

29:02.131 --> 29:03.916
- No further questions.

29:07.833 --> 29:11.488
The prosecution is making
a lot of noise about a jacket.

29:11.532 --> 29:14.535
Do you, in fact,
own a green and orange parka?

29:14.578 --> 29:17.233
- I did, but I donated it
to the Goodwill

29:17.277 --> 29:19.409
a week before the murder.

29:19.453 --> 29:23.631
- Your Honor, I'd like to offer
a receipt of this donation

29:23.674 --> 29:26.939
and ask
that it be marked exhibit 12.

29:29.942 --> 29:33.206
So you're not the person
Stephen Fulcher saw

29:33.249 --> 29:35.948
fleeing the scene
of Jacob Ackerman's murder?

29:35.991 --> 29:37.863
- Absolutely not.
I'd never even heard

29:37.906 --> 29:41.344
of Jacob Ackerman
before I was arrested.

29:41.388 --> 29:42.519
- Thank you.

29:46.523 --> 29:48.917
- Your cell phone location data
puts you

29:48.961 --> 29:52.268
within a 12-block radius
of Jacob Ackerman's brownstone

29:52.312 --> 29:53.617
on the morning of the murder.

29:53.661 --> 29:55.968
How do you explain that?
- I went out for a run.

29:57.534 --> 29:59.493
- You live in Queens.

29:59.536 --> 30:01.756
Jacob Ackerman lived
in the West Village.

30:01.800 --> 30:04.803
- Well, I like to explore
different parts of the city.

30:07.370 --> 30:09.808
- You familiar with a company
called SiteShield?

30:09.851 --> 30:12.375
- Your Honor, we're venturing
into dangerous waters.

30:12.419 --> 30:14.769
- Anything else, Mr. Price?

30:25.519 --> 30:27.738
- The idea
that anyone would travel

30:27.782 --> 30:30.176
over a body of water
and across two boroughs

30:30.219 --> 30:32.308
to jog at 6:00 a.m.
on a Sunday morning,

30:32.352 --> 30:33.483
it's ludicrous.

30:33.527 --> 30:35.659
But I saw the jurors' faces.

30:35.703 --> 30:36.791
They were entertaining it.

30:36.835 --> 30:38.706
- No one likes the idea

30:38.749 --> 30:41.404
of condemning a man
to life in prison.

30:41.448 --> 30:42.971
Credible or not,

30:43.015 --> 30:46.235
reason to doubt
gives them reason to acquit.

30:46.279 --> 30:48.150
- I don't see
how we come back from this.

30:48.194 --> 30:50.370
- Then maybe it's time
to reach out,

30:50.413 --> 30:52.894
discuss a plea.
- Maybe not.

30:52.938 --> 30:54.853
I just got a call
from an attorney

30:54.896 --> 30:56.332
representing Lucas Hobbs.

30:56.376 --> 30:57.899
- The neo-Nazi?

30:57.943 --> 31:00.684
- The guy who spraypainted
Ackerman's brownstone

31:00.728 --> 31:02.382
the morning of the murder.

31:02.425 --> 31:04.775
- What did his lawyer want?

31:09.737 --> 31:12.087
- I was watching the news,

31:12.131 --> 31:14.785
and they did a story
on your trial.

31:14.829 --> 31:17.527
I recognize that guy
you're prosecuting.

31:17.571 --> 31:19.225
- You know David Costa?

31:19.268 --> 31:23.142
- I saw him
the morning of the murder.

31:23.185 --> 31:25.405
- [sighs]
Where exactly did this happen?

31:25.448 --> 31:28.974
- On Ackerman's block,
just a few houses down.

31:29.017 --> 31:31.193
After I tagged his house,
I was headed back

31:31.237 --> 31:33.848
to the subway to go home,
and he bumped into me.

31:33.892 --> 31:36.329
So I shoved him, told him
to watch where he was going.

31:36.372 --> 31:38.679
- Mm, and you remember
what he looks like,

31:38.722 --> 31:41.160
even though it was months ago?

31:41.203 --> 31:43.553
- Yeah,
I'm not gonna forget his face.

31:43.597 --> 31:45.686
He pulled a knife on me.

31:45.729 --> 31:47.688
He said that if I knew
what was good for me,

31:47.731 --> 31:49.995
I'd watch where I was going.

31:50.038 --> 31:51.910
- What did this knife
look like?

31:51.953 --> 31:54.434
- Blade was about yay big.

31:54.477 --> 31:55.914
The handle was kind of gold.

31:55.957 --> 31:58.090
Had, like,
pearl and stuff all in it.

32:02.311 --> 32:03.922
- You notice anything else
about the blade?

32:03.965 --> 32:06.968
Um, did it have
a straight edge?

32:07.012 --> 32:09.971
- No, it was serrated.

32:12.104 --> 32:13.757
- Why didn't you mention this
to police

32:13.801 --> 32:14.758
when they questioned you?

32:14.802 --> 32:17.196
- Because I'm not a snitch.

32:18.501 --> 32:21.330
Not for free, anyway.

32:21.374 --> 32:23.985
- My client
is currently being held

32:24.029 --> 32:25.421
on an aggravated assault
charge.

32:25.465 --> 32:26.770
- We heard.

32:26.814 --> 32:29.295
Attacked a Jewish woman
in broad daylight,

32:29.338 --> 32:30.513
completely unprovoked.

32:30.557 --> 32:32.428
- Mr. Hobbs
maintains his innocence.

32:32.472 --> 32:35.170
And he would be happy
to help in your case

32:35.214 --> 32:37.216
in exchange
for your help with his.

32:44.353 --> 32:46.225
- What did you have in mind?

32:46.268 --> 32:48.009
- A dismissal.

32:49.315 --> 32:51.534
- He put a young woman
in the hospital,

32:51.578 --> 32:52.883
and you want a free pass?

32:52.927 --> 32:56.975
- That, or I don't testify.

33:04.330 --> 33:04.721
.

33:04.765 --> 33:07.594
- Are you certain Lucas Hobbs
is even telling the truth?

33:07.637 --> 33:10.684
Did he really see the defendant
at the murder scene?

33:10.727 --> 33:12.816
- His description
of the knife was spot-on.

33:12.860 --> 33:14.644
And those details
were never made public,

33:14.688 --> 33:16.429
so either he is omniscient

33:16.472 --> 33:20.259
or he saw Costa
holding the knife

33:20.302 --> 33:21.651
a block from the murder scene.

33:21.695 --> 33:24.219
But, Jack, look at this.

33:26.047 --> 33:30.138
Hobbs brutally assaulted
a 19-year-old Jewish woman

33:30.182 --> 33:32.880
when he overheard her
speaking Hebrew with a friend,

33:32.923 --> 33:35.578
and he wants
all charges dropped

33:35.622 --> 33:37.537
in exchange for his testimony.

33:39.191 --> 33:41.367
- We're talking about
a murder case here, Nolan.

33:41.410 --> 33:42.542
- Yeah, I understand that.

33:42.585 --> 33:43.847
I was prepared to offer him

33:43.891 --> 33:45.980
more leniency than he deserves.

33:46.024 --> 33:48.765
But what he did,

33:48.809 --> 33:50.941
he shouldn't be allowed
to walk away scot-free.

33:50.985 --> 33:54.249
- This isn't about what
he deserves or doesn't deserve.

33:54.293 --> 33:57.383
It's about getting justice
for Jacob Ackerman.

33:57.426 --> 33:58.862
- At what expense?

33:58.906 --> 34:01.909
Sarah Khahiri,
the young woman Hobbs attacked,

34:01.952 --> 34:05.347
has a fractured spine from
when he stomped on her back.

34:05.391 --> 34:08.697
She needs surgery
to have her jaw reconstructed.

34:08.742 --> 34:10.699
- What happened
to her is horrific.

34:10.744 --> 34:13.790
But she's still alive.

34:13.833 --> 34:16.576
Mr. Ackerman is not.

34:20.449 --> 34:22.277
- I'm just not comfortable

34:22.321 --> 34:25.018
giving a neo-Nazi
a get-out-of-jail-free card.

34:25.063 --> 34:26.020
I'm not.

34:27.978 --> 34:30.938
Especially with all
the recent anti-Semitic attacks

34:30.981 --> 34:32.853
and the hate out there,

34:32.896 --> 34:35.116
there's a bigger picture
to take into account here.

34:35.159 --> 34:39.686
- I have no more tolerance
for hate crimes than you do,

34:39.728 --> 34:44.212
and I'm all
for adhering to principles,

34:44.255 --> 34:47.998
but not to the exclusion
of trying to win a murder case.

34:48.042 --> 34:52.525
- So you're demanding
that I put this racist, Hobbs,

34:52.568 --> 34:53.612
on the stand?

34:53.656 --> 34:55.963
- Can you win without him?

34:58.661 --> 35:02.491
- I don't know,
but I'm not sure

35:02.535 --> 35:05.755
if it's worth winning
like this.

35:05.799 --> 35:09.150
- Tell that
to Jacob Ackerman's son

35:09.194 --> 35:14.112
and the families of the six
people who died in that fire.

35:16.462 --> 35:19.160
Maybe I'm just old-fashioned,

35:19.204 --> 35:22.555
but if the cost
of convicting someone

35:22.598 --> 35:27.560
responsible for eight deaths,
including three children,

35:27.603 --> 35:32.782
is cutting a sweetheart deal
with a white supremacist,

35:32.826 --> 35:36.612
I'd take that deal
all day long.

35:36.656 --> 35:40.138

35:54.326 --> 35:58.721
- And how can you be certain,
Mr. Hobbs,

35:58.765 --> 36:00.767
that the man
who pulled a knife on you

36:00.810 --> 36:02.986
right outside
of Jacob Ackerman's brownstone

36:03.030 --> 36:06.903
that morning
was the defendant?

36:06.947 --> 36:08.949
- I got a really good look
at him.

36:08.992 --> 36:10.211
He got right up in my face.

36:10.255 --> 36:12.213
He was all amped up.

36:12.257 --> 36:16.261
I could see it in his eyes that
he didn't just have a knife,

36:16.304 --> 36:18.350
he was willing to use it.

36:21.048 --> 36:23.224
- Nothing further
for this witness.

36:25.444 --> 36:29.143
- Mr. Hobbs, you were initially
questioned by detectives

36:29.187 --> 36:32.494
as a suspect in the murder
of Jacob Ackerman,

36:32.538 --> 36:33.669
is that not correct?

36:33.713 --> 36:37.107
- Yeah, but I didn't do it.

36:37.151 --> 36:39.197
- But you didn't mention
anything to them

36:39.240 --> 36:41.199
about seeing someone
with a knife that morning,

36:41.242 --> 36:43.070
did you?

36:43.113 --> 36:44.376
- No.

36:44.419 --> 36:48.031
- So you knew
Ackerman got stabbed,

36:48.075 --> 36:51.252
and you now are claiming
that you saw someone

36:51.296 --> 36:54.124
brandishing a knife
outside his home,

36:54.168 --> 36:57.040
but you didn't think
that information was pertinent?

36:58.607 --> 37:02.785
- I don't really have the best
relationship with the police.

37:04.134 --> 37:07.355
- Well,
that's putting it lightly.

37:07.399 --> 37:10.532
In fact, you were charged

37:10.576 --> 37:13.231
with vandalizing
Ackerman's house

37:13.274 --> 37:16.538
with anti-Semitic graffiti,
isn't that correct?

37:16.582 --> 37:17.887

37:17.931 --> 37:19.237

37:19.280 --> 37:21.804

The witness is not on trial.

of a 19-year-old Jewish girl?

37:34.339 --> 37:35.775

your testimony here today

37:38.168 --> 37:40.083
in exchange
for the district attorney

37:40.127 --> 37:42.999
giving you a full dismissal
of that case?

37:43.043 --> 37:45.915
- Yes, it is.

37:48.570 --> 37:51.747
- I have no further questions.

37:51.791 --> 37:53.967
- Any redirect, Mr. Price?

38:02.367 --> 38:07.676

38:09.374 --> 38:11.680

correct?

38:11.724 --> 38:13.029
- Yeah.

38:13.073 --> 38:18.252

a prominent Jewish figure
like Jacob Ackerman,
