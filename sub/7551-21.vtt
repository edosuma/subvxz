00:09.092 --> 00:10.625
[camera shutter clicks]

00:13.096 --> 00:14.863
Castle: "To Farrah,

00:14.898 --> 00:17.632
"may the greatest mysteries
of your life

00:17.666 --> 00:19.701
"lie ahead.

00:19.735 --> 00:21.970
Richard Castle."

00:22.005 --> 00:24.139
Thank you so much. [Giggles]

00:24.173 --> 00:26.240
You know, our pilot is
also a huge fan.

00:26.275 --> 00:27.909
You think you could sign
a book for her, too?

00:27.943 --> 00:29.878
I'd love to.
All I ask in return is that

00:29.912 --> 00:31.846
she deliver us
to Heathrow safely.

00:31.881 --> 00:33.981
[Laughs] Hey. Hey.

00:34.016 --> 00:35.850
Enjoy your stay in London,
Mr. Castle.

00:35.885 --> 00:37.351
Thank you.

00:37.386 --> 00:39.020
I got bumped
out of my assigned seat.

00:39.054 --> 00:40.321
You said you'd fix it.

00:40.355 --> 00:42.323
I said you had my apology.

00:42.357 --> 00:44.325
This is the only seat
available in first.

00:44.359 --> 00:46.093
Do you know who I am?

00:46.128 --> 00:48.662
I don't know who he is,
but I know <i>what</i> he is...

00:48.696 --> 00:50.864
a giant ass. Whoa! [Turbulence
rumbles, passengers gasping]

00:50.899 --> 00:53.367
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa. Whoa.

00:53.402 --> 00:56.170
[Bell dings]

00:56.204 --> 00:58.272
Dad, when did you become
such a nervous flier?

00:58.307 --> 01:00.707
I'm not. I just
don't like turbulence...

01:00.742 --> 01:03.176
Or sudden drop in cabin pressure

01:03.210 --> 01:05.045
or mechanical problems

01:05.078 --> 01:06.947
or crashing.

01:06.981 --> 01:09.115
There's nothing to worry about.

01:09.150 --> 01:11.051
It's just a little bumpy air.
That's all it is.

01:11.085 --> 01:14.020
Air, by nature,
should not be bumpy.

01:14.055 --> 01:15.588
Just look at the flight crew.

01:15.622 --> 01:17.257
If they're up and smiling,
then everything is fine.

01:17.291 --> 01:21.227
[Turbulence rumbles,
glasses clink]

01:21.262 --> 01:24.097
Yes, well, they're up, but they
are not exactly smiling.

01:24.131 --> 01:25.798
Dad, it's a long flight.

01:25.833 --> 01:27.267
You should really focus
on something else,

01:27.301 --> 01:28.768
or it'll seem even longer...

01:28.802 --> 01:30.303
For both of us.

01:30.338 --> 01:33.439
Fine. I shall ignore
the grim specter of death

01:33.474 --> 01:36.375
and focus...
focus on our itinerary.

01:36.409 --> 01:39.078
[Turbulence rumbling]

01:39.112 --> 01:42.748
All right. Car is going to
pick us up from the hotel,

01:42.783 --> 01:44.884
whisk us off to
the Sherlock Holmes society,

01:44.918 --> 01:47.152
where I will speak to my fellow
mystery writers about...

01:47.187 --> 01:49.088
Actually, I made plans
for tonight.

01:49.122 --> 01:51.823
W... what plans? With who?

01:51.858 --> 01:53.807
Oh, some friends who are doing
their semester abroad in London.

01:53.827 --> 01:55.527
We're meeting a pub
in south Ken.

01:55.562 --> 01:57.963
But the, um,
Sherlock Holmes society

01:57.998 --> 02:01.667
is convening
at 221b Baker Street.

02:01.702 --> 02:03.002
You don't want to miss
the actual home

02:03.036 --> 02:04.203
of Sherlock Holmes.

02:04.237 --> 02:06.638
You do know he's fictional,
right?

02:06.673 --> 02:08.306
Yes, but his address is real.
[Chuckles]

02:08.341 --> 02:09.808
And I will be speaking,
and if you're not there,

02:09.842 --> 02:12.143
- who will be proud of me?
- I'm always proud of you, dad.

02:12.178 --> 02:14.813
But I've heard you speak
a million times.

02:14.847 --> 02:15.847
I know what you're gonna say.

02:15.881 --> 02:17.683
That is improbable.

02:17.717 --> 02:19.651
You'll say you don't believe
in writer's block,

02:19.686 --> 02:21.385
that you wrote your first novel
to impress a girl.

02:21.420 --> 02:23.387
That reading great writers
inspires you,

02:23.422 --> 02:24.689
and drinking with them
inspires you

02:24.724 --> 02:26.825
to beat them
on the best-seller list.

02:26.859 --> 02:28.727
Okay.

02:28.761 --> 02:31.730
Clearly I need to
develop some new material.

02:31.764 --> 02:32.597
But this was supposed to be

02:32.631 --> 02:34.733
old-fashioned
father-daughter time.

02:34.767 --> 02:36.667
Dad, watching you speak
to your cronies

02:36.702 --> 02:38.636
isn't exactly
father-daughter time.

02:38.670 --> 02:39.903
Besides, I'm not 12.

02:39.938 --> 02:41.405
We don't have to be
attached at the hip.

02:41.440 --> 02:42.707
[Turbulence rumbling,
glasses clink]

02:42.741 --> 02:44.141
[Passengers murmuring]

02:44.175 --> 02:47.645
Okay. That impending specter
of death... it's back.

02:47.679 --> 02:49.513
[Tablet rings] Oh.

02:49.548 --> 02:52.550
Hey. Beckett. How did you
get in there?

02:52.584 --> 02:54.384
<i>Through the magic of wifi.</i>

02:54.418 --> 02:56.419
<i>I figured you'd be online.</i>

02:56.454 --> 02:58.155
So I thought that you
would want an update.

02:58.189 --> 03:00.891
We solved the case.
The race car driver did it.

03:00.925 --> 03:03.227
<i>Ah. That's good to hear.</i>

03:03.261 --> 03:05.328
Is everything okay up there?

03:05.363 --> 03:07.831
<i>Just a little turbulence.</i>

03:07.866 --> 03:08.732
Passengers: Whoa!

03:08.767 --> 03:10.900
[Rumbling continues,
glasses clinking]

03:10.934 --> 03:13.436
<i>Castle, is something wrong?</i>

03:13.471 --> 03:15.938
Yeah... everything's
gonna be just fine.

03:15.973 --> 03:17.574
Hey, Castle.

03:17.608 --> 03:21.110
<i>[Rumbling, grunting]</i>

03:21.145 --> 03:23.413
Castle?
[Beep]

03:23.447 --> 03:26.115
Is it just me, or does
everything <i>not</i> seem just fine?

03:26.150 --> 03:27.316
Beckett, relax.

03:27.350 --> 03:29.585
Even the most heinous turbulence
won't bring a plane down.

03:29.619 --> 03:31.553
And every day, 20 flights
leave New York

03:31.588 --> 03:32.922
and land in London
without a problem.

03:32.956 --> 03:34.803
It's gonna be the same for Castle's
flight, too.

03:34.823 --> 03:35.889
Esposito: Yeah.

03:37.394 --> 03:40.963
[Rumbling,
passengers murmuring]

03:40.998 --> 03:42.799
It's gonna be all right.
[Exhales]

03:42.833 --> 03:44.433
<i>Woman on P.A.:
Folks, this is Captain Edmunds.</i>

03:44.467 --> 03:46.067
<i>We hit some chop there,
but we've climbed</i>

03:46.102 --> 03:48.404
<i>to 39,000 feet and expect
a smooth ride</i>

03:48.438 --> 03:49.805
<i>all the way to Heathrow.</i>

03:49.839 --> 03:52.408
See? There's nothing
to worry about.

03:52.442 --> 03:55.577
Yeah.
[Whispering indistinctly]

03:55.612 --> 03:57.212
Now why aren't they smiling?

03:57.246 --> 03:58.580
Dad, you heard the pilot.

03:58.615 --> 04:02.050
I'm telling you, something is not right.
[Unfastens seat belt]

04:02.084 --> 04:04.286
And I am going to find out what.

04:04.320 --> 04:06.988
[Indistinct whispering
continues]

04:07.023 --> 04:08.756
Excuse me.

04:08.791 --> 04:10.658
Sir, the seat belt sign
is still illuminated.

04:10.693 --> 04:11.626
If you could please
return to your seat...

04:11.660 --> 04:13.829
You're not smiling.
None of you are smiling.

04:13.863 --> 04:15.230
And the captain's here?
What's going on?

04:15.264 --> 04:16.197
Is there some kind
of mechanical problem?

04:16.232 --> 04:19.233
- Please, sir, just return...
- Jim, wait. Um...

04:19.267 --> 04:21.365
Maybe he can help.

04:21.970 --> 04:24.138
Mr. Castle, I'm Captain Edmunds.

04:24.172 --> 04:26.140
You work with the N.Y.P.D.,
right?

04:26.174 --> 04:28.476
We could actually
use your assistance.

04:28.510 --> 04:31.145
My assistance with what?

04:31.179 --> 04:32.847
This is Kyle Ford.

04:32.881 --> 04:34.915
He's the air marshal
on this flight.

04:34.950 --> 04:36.650
I saw this guy.
He's sitting in my row.

04:36.684 --> 04:39.586
He... at least, he <i>was</i>
<i>sitting in my row.</i>

04:39.620 --> 04:41.121
What does this have to do
with the air marshal?

04:41.156 --> 04:43.523
An hour ago, he sent a text
to his field office

04:43.558 --> 04:46.160
about a security issue
on board this air craft.

04:46.194 --> 04:48.329
What kind of security issue?

04:48.363 --> 04:50.764
"Possible threat
to oceanic air flight 57.

04:50.798 --> 04:52.131
I'm investigating."

04:52.166 --> 04:53.967
That's all
Ford said in his text.

04:54.001 --> 04:55.034
And what did he tell you?

04:55.069 --> 04:58.204
Unfortunately, I haven't
been able to talk to him.

04:58.239 --> 05:00.039
Mr. Ford is missing.

05:00.074 --> 05:02.110
Missing?

05:03.478 --> 05:04.845
[Lowered voice] Missing?

05:04.879 --> 05:07.480
How could he be missing?
Did you search the plane?

05:07.514 --> 05:08.848
From front to back.

05:08.883 --> 05:10.884
Given the circumstances,
I've been instructed

05:10.918 --> 05:13.953
to lock myself in the cockpit
and continue on to Heathrow.

05:13.988 --> 05:16.055
- Terrorism protocol.
- Precisely.

05:16.090 --> 05:17.957
Right now, with
the air marshal unaccounted for,

05:17.992 --> 05:19.692
you're the closest thing we have

05:19.726 --> 05:21.361
to law enforcement
on this plane.

05:21.395 --> 05:23.396
Which in itself
is cause for concern.

05:23.430 --> 05:25.330
Will you help us, Mr. Castle?

05:25.365 --> 05:27.867
Yeah. Yes. No, of course.

05:27.901 --> 05:29.535
Of course. Okay, um...

05:29.569 --> 05:32.471
When you searched the plane,
where did you look?

05:32.506 --> 05:34.973
- Um, the restrooms, the galleys.
- Good.

05:35.008 --> 05:36.241
- Uh, cargo hold.
- Great.

05:36.276 --> 05:38.099
Even the overhead bins.

05:38.578 --> 05:41.046
Okay, well, Mr. Ford
is on the plane somewhere.

05:41.080 --> 05:42.981
We just have to search again.

05:43.016 --> 05:46.018
Maybe... skip the overhead bins
this time.

05:51.791 --> 05:55.027
[Roaring]

05:56.695 --> 05:59.030
[Lowered voice] I don't know.
It's like he just disappeared.

05:59.064 --> 06:00.598
It doesn't make sense.
Excuse me.

06:00.633 --> 06:02.233
How well do you know
the air marshal?

06:02.267 --> 06:03.601
Not that well.

06:03.636 --> 06:05.937
Mr. Ford only flies with us
like twice a month.

06:05.971 --> 06:09.206
He's very professional,
very polite. There you go.

06:09.241 --> 06:12.176
Okay. This...
[Clank]

06:12.210 --> 06:13.677
Is the only other place

06:13.711 --> 06:16.347
we haven't given a second look.

06:23.121 --> 06:24.956
Does Ford know
how to get down here?

06:24.990 --> 06:26.257
Of course. He has access

06:26.291 --> 06:28.059
to the entire plane,
just like we do.

06:28.093 --> 06:31.061
Runs the length of the plane.
And you looked everywhere?

06:31.095 --> 06:32.463
Well, we didn't pull out
all the luggage

06:32.497 --> 06:34.164
'cause there was no sign
anyone was down here.

06:39.904 --> 06:42.405
[Hisses] Aah!

06:42.440 --> 06:43.907
[Continues hissing]

06:43.942 --> 06:45.976
There's a snake
on the mother-flyin' plane.

06:46.010 --> 06:47.077
You're lucky
it wasn't the pit bulls

06:47.111 --> 06:49.112
we had to ship last week.

06:52.583 --> 06:54.417
Look at this luggage.

06:54.452 --> 06:56.052
Since when
does the airline allow

06:56.087 --> 06:57.988
clothes hanging out of bags?

06:58.022 --> 06:59.055
They don't, not usually.

06:59.090 --> 07:01.124
That's three different bags...

07:01.158 --> 07:02.925
From three different passengers.

07:02.960 --> 07:04.059
That doesn't make any sense.

07:04.094 --> 07:07.162
- Unless...
- Unless what?

07:07.197 --> 07:08.764
Unless someone took the clothes

07:08.799 --> 07:10.600
out of another suitcase,

07:10.634 --> 07:12.602
stuffed them into
those three bags.

07:14.304 --> 07:15.337
You don't think...

07:15.372 --> 07:16.973
One way to find out.

07:21.177 --> 07:22.751
[Latch clicks]

07:23.713 --> 07:25.347
Oh, my God.

07:25.382 --> 07:27.949
That's Air Marshal Ford.

sync and corrected by ninh
www.addic7ed.com

07:37.038 --> 07:39.689
You've got to be kidding me.
The air marshal is dead?

07:39.709 --> 07:43.389
Not just dead, but bonked
on the head, murdered.

07:43.409 --> 07:44.643
And there's more.

07:44.677 --> 07:46.545
There's more?

07:46.579 --> 07:49.899
Kyle Ford's holster is empty.
His gun is missing.

07:49.919 --> 07:53.552
Okay, so, uh, we have to assume
that the killer is armed.

07:53.586 --> 07:55.153
And they may have
another agenda...

07:55.187 --> 07:57.455
taking hostages,
hijacking the plane.

07:57.489 --> 08:01.325
F.Y.I., this is not the relaxing
London getaway I had planned.

08:01.360 --> 08:02.427
So who else knows about this?

08:02.461 --> 08:04.529
Well, just the flight crew,
the air marshal service,

08:04.563 --> 08:05.629
and the F.B.I.

08:05.664 --> 08:07.231
And how can I help?

08:07.266 --> 08:09.333
Uh, they gave me a copy
of the flight manifest.

08:09.368 --> 08:11.001
I e-mailed it to you.
You should have that by now.

08:11.036 --> 08:13.204
Good. I'll coordinate
with the F.B.I.

08:13.238 --> 08:16.073
And start running names to look for
red flags. [Keys click, beep]

08:16.107 --> 08:18.475
Are you okay?

08:18.509 --> 08:20.243
Alex is on this flight,

08:20.278 --> 08:22.546
along with almost
200 other people.

08:23.848 --> 08:26.483
Castle... You can do this.

08:26.517 --> 08:28.986
Do what? What am I supposed
to do, catch the killer?

08:29.020 --> 08:31.188
It could be anyone.
I wouldn't know where to start.

08:31.222 --> 08:32.522
You start at the beginning.

08:32.557 --> 08:33.990
We build a timeline
for our victim,

08:34.024 --> 08:35.491
same first step we always take.

08:35.525 --> 08:37.094
Right.

08:37.128 --> 08:39.496
I just... this time,
that first step is...

08:39.530 --> 08:41.063
39,000 feet off the ground.

08:41.099 --> 08:42.832
Castle, I'm gonna be here
with you.

08:42.866 --> 08:44.501
I'll be working this case
from the ground,

08:44.535 --> 08:45.868
along with the boys.

08:45.903 --> 08:48.370
Okay. Thank you.

08:48.405 --> 08:49.606
I can figure this out.

08:49.640 --> 08:51.574
I know you can.

08:51.609 --> 08:54.276
I am sorry, miss.
This area is off-limits.

08:54.311 --> 08:55.544
Oh, she's... that's...
she's with me.

08:55.579 --> 08:57.046
That's my daughter, and she's...

08:58.616 --> 09:01.784
You were gone so long,
I got worried.

09:01.819 --> 09:03.352
Why are you down here?

09:03.386 --> 09:05.187
Uh, I'll call you later.
I love you.

09:05.222 --> 09:07.389
I love you, too.

09:07.424 --> 09:09.291
Always rooting for that coyote,
not the road runner. Right.

09:09.326 --> 09:11.026
Guys?

09:11.060 --> 09:13.195
I need your help.

09:13.230 --> 09:16.198
Alexis: Who do you think
could have done it?

09:16.233 --> 09:17.600
Well, that's what I'm gonna
try to figure out.

09:17.634 --> 09:19.235
How?

09:19.269 --> 09:21.569
By reconstructing Ford's
movements with the flight crew.

09:21.604 --> 09:23.805
In the meantime, I need you
to keep this to yourself

09:23.840 --> 09:25.607
and go back upstairs
where it's safer.

09:25.642 --> 09:29.377
How is it safer?
Isn't that where the killer is?

09:29.411 --> 09:31.713
Look, I just don't want you
to be a part of this.

09:31.748 --> 09:34.582
I'm already part of it.
I can help, dad.

09:34.617 --> 09:36.451
I interned with Lanie, remember?

09:36.485 --> 09:37.918
I'll check the body for clues.

09:37.953 --> 09:39.754
Well, a... Alexis...

09:39.788 --> 09:41.489
there's a killer on this plane.

09:41.524 --> 09:44.058
We don't know what he's
planning or who he is,

09:44.092 --> 09:46.494
and maybe I can do
something about that.

09:46.529 --> 09:48.896
I am not going back to my seat.

09:48.930 --> 09:51.832
Even if it means us being
joined at the hip?

09:51.867 --> 09:53.567
Really?

09:53.601 --> 09:55.002
You're throwing that back
at me <i>now?</i>

09:55.037 --> 09:56.771
Right in your face.
[Sighs]

09:56.805 --> 09:58.105
I'll get started here.

09:58.140 --> 09:59.640
You go talk to the flight crew

09:59.675 --> 10:01.642
- and try to figure out who did this.
- Right.

10:03.511 --> 10:06.080
It was someone out there.

10:06.114 --> 10:09.016
One of those people
killed Kyle Ford.

10:09.051 --> 10:10.584
I just told the other
flight attendants.

10:10.618 --> 10:12.118
I still can't believe this.

10:12.153 --> 10:13.820
What do we do now, Mr. Castle?

10:13.854 --> 10:15.689
Well, now we try
to piece together

10:15.723 --> 10:17.691
where the victim was
and who he had contact with

10:17.725 --> 10:18.592
before he died.

10:18.626 --> 10:20.427
When was the last time
anyone remembers

10:20.461 --> 10:21.861
seeing Air Marshal Ford?

10:21.896 --> 10:23.940
Wait, who served him
during drink service?

10:23.960 --> 10:24.665
I did.

10:24.699 --> 10:26.700
Okay, this was
an 8:30 A.M. flight.

10:26.734 --> 10:28.034
Drink service occurred when?

10:28.069 --> 10:29.335
Uh, we start at 10:00.

10:29.369 --> 10:30.870
And by the time I did
the trash pickup,

10:30.905 --> 10:32.872
Ford wasn't in his seat.
He was gone.

10:32.907 --> 10:34.607
Not gone. I noticed him
during meal service

10:34.641 --> 10:37.143
- near the back of the plane.
- Doing what?

10:37.178 --> 10:38.978
Oh, I didn't see because
a passenger got in my face

10:39.013 --> 10:39.979
about the lousy food.

10:40.014 --> 10:42.015
We recently switched vendors
to save money...

10:42.049 --> 10:44.483
I... when you saw him,

10:44.518 --> 10:46.686
was he in aisle 1 or aisle 2?

10:46.720 --> 10:49.488
If it was meal service, aisle 1
is blocked by the cart...

10:49.523 --> 10:52.157
so aisle 2. What time was that?

10:52.192 --> 10:53.626
Just before 11:00.

10:53.660 --> 10:55.494
And we found the body at 11:35,

10:55.529 --> 10:58.364
giving us about a 35-minute
window before he was killed.

10:58.398 --> 11:00.733
Does anyone else remember seeing
him at the back of the plane?

11:00.767 --> 11:02.968
Was he with someone?

11:03.002 --> 11:05.738
Come on, you guys,
try to remember.

11:05.772 --> 11:08.573
Maybe we can ask the passengers
in back if they saw him.

11:08.608 --> 11:10.475
No, if we did that, word would
get out something is wrong,

11:10.509 --> 11:12.854
word that could make it
back to the killer.

11:14.848 --> 11:16.648
Maybe there's another way

11:16.682 --> 11:19.684
to know what Ford was doing
at the back of this aisle.

11:19.719 --> 11:21.620
How long have those two gentlemen been
taking selfies? [Camera shutter clicking]

11:21.654 --> 11:23.288
The honeymooners?

11:23.322 --> 11:24.989
Since their first pimm's cup.
They're adorable.

11:25.023 --> 11:26.858
I have to talk to them.

11:26.892 --> 11:28.460
What should we do?

11:28.494 --> 11:30.629
You have the hardest job of all.

11:30.663 --> 11:33.197
Pretend like everything's
normal.

11:33.232 --> 11:34.632
[Imitates British accent]
I think for the rest of the trip

11:34.666 --> 11:35.967
we should talk like this.

11:36.001 --> 11:37.501
[Imitates British accent]
So posh. [Laughs]

11:37.535 --> 11:39.837
How do you say "selfie"
in British?

11:39.872 --> 11:41.705
Sew-fee!

11:41.740 --> 11:43.674
<i>Sophie?
[Both laugh]</i>

11:43.708 --> 11:45.843
Why don't I grab a proper
picture of the two of you?

11:45.878 --> 11:47.578
[American accent]
Oh, great, thanks.

11:47.612 --> 11:48.812
You bet.

11:48.846 --> 11:51.315
Here we go.

11:54.753 --> 11:56.487
[Clenches teeth] Can you
hurry up? My face is hurting.

11:56.521 --> 11:58.689
[Laughter]
Right. One more for safety.

11:58.723 --> 11:59.757
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

11:59.791 --> 12:01.659
So how did you guys meet?

12:01.693 --> 12:04.528
It's kind of a long story.
[Gasps] Well...

12:04.562 --> 12:06.263
I love long stories.

12:06.297 --> 12:07.330
Oh, God...

12:07.364 --> 12:09.565
<i>It's awful what you're
dealing with, sweetie.</i>

12:09.600 --> 12:11.268
Thanks for your help, Lanie.

12:11.302 --> 12:14.104
<i>Are you kidding? I just wish
there was more I could do.</i>

12:14.138 --> 12:16.006
I'm gonna talk you
through this, all right?

12:16.040 --> 12:18.275
Do you want to see
the head wound first?

12:18.309 --> 12:21.377
<i>Yeah, but you're gonna need
to get in really close.</i>

12:23.000 --> 12:29.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

12:32.623 --> 12:35.725
Try moving the hair back
a little.

12:35.759 --> 12:37.727
Yeah, there we go.

12:37.761 --> 12:38.861
Can you tell what he was
hit with?

12:38.895 --> 12:43.398
Mm, it's hard to say.
Something oblong. A pipe, maybe.

12:44.767 --> 12:45.835
Oh, man.

12:45.869 --> 12:49.604
Alexis, are you all right?
It's just another body.

12:49.639 --> 12:51.606
<i>You've done this plenty
of times before.</i>

12:51.641 --> 12:53.375
It's not the body
I'm worried about.

12:53.409 --> 12:55.777
It's the person who killed him
and took his gun.

12:55.812 --> 12:58.046
And looking at this,
there is something

12:58.080 --> 13:00.882
I can tell you about
who that person is.

13:05.087 --> 13:07.222
[Lowered voice] Dad...

13:07.256 --> 13:09.324
[Lowered voice]
Lanie find something?

13:09.359 --> 13:11.326
[Seat belt clicks] No signs of
a struggle, but it looks like

13:11.360 --> 13:13.962
Ford died from a single blow
to the back of the head...

13:13.996 --> 13:15.429
the left parietal bone.

13:15.464 --> 13:17.832
So the killer must have
caught him by surprise.

13:17.867 --> 13:19.800
The bigger news is
that the angle of the blow

13:19.835 --> 13:22.003
indicates that whoever
did this was left-handed.

13:22.037 --> 13:24.638
Statistically speaking,
that rules out

13:24.673 --> 13:27.908
most everyone on the plane.
Good work.

13:27.942 --> 13:31.011
The... Gay couple?
Are they suspects?

13:31.045 --> 13:32.646
Nah, I really doubt it.

13:32.681 --> 13:33.681
Then why do you have
their selfies?

13:33.715 --> 13:36.016
Well, I e-mailed them
to myself off their phone.

13:36.050 --> 13:37.752
It's a long story.

13:37.786 --> 13:40.187
Almost as long as the one
about how they met.

13:40.221 --> 13:42.356
But they take these
near the time

13:42.391 --> 13:44.157
air marshal Ford was
at the back of the plane.

13:44.192 --> 13:45.825
I was hoping he'd show up
in one of them

13:45.860 --> 13:46.994
along with the killer,
but no luck.

13:47.028 --> 13:48.328
Not even in the video?

13:48.363 --> 13:50.530
Actually, I didn't
check out that one.

13:50.564 --> 13:53.033
<i>Both: Hello!</i>

13:53.067 --> 13:54.701
<i>We did it!</i>

13:54.735 --> 13:56.669
In the background. There he is.

13:56.704 --> 13:58.538
That's Ford.

13:58.572 --> 14:00.874
But he's not with anybody.

14:00.908 --> 14:03.610
He was checking
the overhead bin.

14:03.644 --> 14:04.977
Yeah, but for what?
Not his own bag.

14:05.012 --> 14:06.479
He was up here in first with us.

14:06.514 --> 14:07.781
Let's play it again.

14:07.815 --> 14:09.215
[Video sound muted]

14:09.249 --> 14:11.350
Maybe something's in there.

14:11.385 --> 14:14.186
Ford says he was onto
a possible threat.

14:14.221 --> 14:16.288
But he's not even looking
inside.

14:17.991 --> 14:20.459
Because the overhead bin
is a ruse.

14:20.493 --> 14:22.728
See how Ford is glancing
over his shoulder?

14:22.762 --> 14:25.064
He's clocking someone.
You're right.

14:25.098 --> 14:26.165
It's this guy, uh...

14:26.199 --> 14:28.734
26b.

14:28.768 --> 14:30.669
And look.

14:30.703 --> 14:32.305
He realizes Ford
is watching him.

14:32.339 --> 14:33.839
[Paper rustles]

14:33.873 --> 14:35.841
26b, 26b...

14:35.875 --> 14:37.375
Isadore Baldon.

14:37.410 --> 14:40.746
Beckett: Isadore Baldon, 25,
of Brooklyn.

14:40.780 --> 14:42.180
No criminal record, but...

14:42.214 --> 14:44.650
We have a problem, Castle.

14:44.684 --> 14:45.651
What's the problem?

14:45.685 --> 14:47.753
He doesn't match the man
that you described.

14:47.787 --> 14:51.556
We contacted Baldon.
He's actually here in town.

14:51.590 --> 14:53.925
His passport was stolen
weeks ago.

14:53.960 --> 14:56.928
Whoever is sitting in 26b,
it's not Isadore Baldon.

14:56.963 --> 14:58.663
Oh, maybe that's why
Ford was watching him.

14:58.697 --> 14:59.597
He got onto that somehow.

14:59.631 --> 15:01.866
And then moments later
Ford was murdered.

15:02.901 --> 15:06.004
I think we found our killer.

15:14.629 --> 15:16.457
[Roaring]

15:17.624 --> 15:19.961
Woman: What's he doing?

15:19.981 --> 15:21.943
Sweating bullets. He's nervous.

15:21.996 --> 15:23.964
Of course he's nervous.
He just killed Kyle Ford.

15:23.998 --> 15:25.532
We don't know that, Jim.

15:25.567 --> 15:27.200
He's flying
on a stolen passport.

15:27.235 --> 15:30.303
He requested a seat in the back
near the cargo hold.

15:30.338 --> 15:33.673
You saw the video. Ford was
watching him, and now he's dead.

15:33.693 --> 15:35.609
Debbie, you can't tell me
he doesn't meet the criteria

15:35.643 --> 15:37.978
for posing a threat
to passengers and crew.

15:38.012 --> 15:39.545
No, he definitely does.
Under the circumstances,

15:39.580 --> 15:41.014
we're empowered to detain him,

15:41.048 --> 15:42.875
and we have the training
to do so.

15:42.895 --> 15:44.650
I don't think you should,
not just yet.

15:44.685 --> 15:47.936
Well, you're not responsible
for the people on this plane. We are.

15:47.956 --> 15:50.156
Yeah. And if he did it, he has a gun.

15:50.191 --> 15:51.624
And I, for one,
don't want to wait

15:51.658 --> 15:53.026
for him to start shooting it.

15:53.060 --> 15:54.861
And what if he's not our guy?

15:54.895 --> 15:56.896
You go out there
and take him down,

15:56.930 --> 15:59.031
it'll start a panic,
alert the real killer,

15:59.065 --> 16:00.966
and he may pull a gun anyway.

16:01.001 --> 16:02.468
Okay, so what do you propose?

16:02.503 --> 16:04.336
We need to identify him,

16:04.371 --> 16:07.195
figure out who it is
we're dealing with.

16:08.008 --> 16:10.175
Isn't it about time
for another drink service?

16:10.210 --> 16:11.877
It would be, except for that
the airline's cut back,

16:11.912 --> 16:14.690
- so now we're only allowed...
- Jim. Jim.

16:15.078 --> 16:16.610
My treat.

16:18.316 --> 16:19.919
Trash?

16:19.953 --> 16:21.753
[Can clatters] Thank you.

16:21.788 --> 16:24.290
Thank you very much.

16:33.201 --> 16:35.547
Can I take that for you, sir?

16:42.141 --> 16:44.008
[Slurps]

16:45.811 --> 16:48.413
[Trash rustles]
Thank you so much.

16:54.500 --> 16:56.787
Well played, Farrah.

16:56.822 --> 16:57.888
What are we doing now?

16:57.923 --> 17:00.123
He's using the graphite
from his mechanical pencil

17:00.158 --> 17:02.960
to make fingerprint powder.
I saw this on "MacGyver" once.

17:02.994 --> 17:04.595
Well, I actually met
Richard Dean Anderson.

17:04.628 --> 17:06.096
- You know what he said?
- Can you please do it already?

17:06.130 --> 17:08.241
- Right.
- Thank you.

17:14.271 --> 17:16.239
It's actually working.

17:16.273 --> 17:17.941
Sweet.

17:23.064 --> 17:25.949
[Shutter clicks] I got a
hit off the F.B.I. database.

17:25.983 --> 17:29.219
Aiman Haddad. He's a Syrian
national in the U.S.

17:29.253 --> 17:31.421
on a student visa,
enrolled at Hudson University.

17:31.456 --> 17:33.089
24 years old.

17:33.123 --> 17:35.057
Wait, if he's here legally,
then why would he be

17:35.092 --> 17:36.826
traveling on a stolen passport?

17:36.861 --> 17:39.161
It might be because the F.B.I.
Has him on the no-fly list.

17:39.196 --> 17:40.730
For what reason?

17:40.764 --> 17:44.066
Apparently Aiman Haddad is
affiliated with I.S.I.S.

17:44.101 --> 17:45.334
He's a terrorist?

17:45.369 --> 17:48.304
It gets worse. I just talked to
Haddad's roommate at Hudson.

17:48.338 --> 17:50.572
He said that Haddad had
recently become super religious

17:50.607 --> 17:52.941
and sold all of his stuff,
and when the roommate asked why,

17:52.976 --> 17:56.178
Haddad said that he wasn't
going to be needing it anymore.

17:56.213 --> 17:58.047
We got to tell Castle.

18:00.217 --> 18:02.251
Yeah. Thank you
for letting me know.

18:02.285 --> 18:05.154
I'll call you later. [Beep]

18:05.188 --> 18:07.623
What is it?
What did Beckett say?

18:09.025 --> 18:10.859
I want you to go back
to first class.

18:10.894 --> 18:12.711
Stay there until I tell you.

18:13.062 --> 18:15.030
Okay.

18:15.064 --> 18:16.996
- Be careful, dad.
- Okay.

18:22.309 --> 18:23.804
I take it he's a bad guy.

18:23.839 --> 18:26.474
He's on the no-fly list,
and for good reason.

18:26.509 --> 18:28.209
- So he's a terrorist.
- Oh, my God.

18:28.244 --> 18:30.045
He murdered the air marshal.

18:30.079 --> 18:32.013
Now that is a bold act
committed by someone

18:32.048 --> 18:34.649
not concerned with what happens
to him once the plane lands.

18:34.683 --> 18:36.184
Because maybe the plane
won't be landing.

18:36.218 --> 18:38.153
I think we can assume the worst.

18:38.187 --> 18:41.121
Assume that his plan is bigger
than killing Kyle Ford.

18:41.156 --> 18:42.222
Okay, we know what to do.

18:42.257 --> 18:44.058
First, we isolate him
if possible.

18:44.092 --> 18:46.060
I'll control his hands
so he doesn't go for the gun

18:46.094 --> 18:47.562
or something worse.

18:47.596 --> 18:48.763
I'll get the zip ties
to secure him.

18:48.797 --> 18:51.498
Good, and like you said, I think
we should do this quietly.

18:51.533 --> 18:53.367
Try to get him out of his seat

18:53.401 --> 18:55.235
and away from
the other passengers.

18:55.270 --> 18:57.071
I could page him back
to the rear galley.

18:57.105 --> 18:58.872
He might get suspicious.
That's too risky.

18:58.906 --> 19:01.241
If he realizes we're trying
to take him down,

19:01.276 --> 19:03.601
he may do something desperate.

19:08.049 --> 19:10.016
[Passengers murmuring]
Hey, what are you doing?

19:11.086 --> 19:12.686
Woman: What's going on?

19:14.622 --> 19:17.057
[Door locks]

19:17.091 --> 19:18.491
Open the door!

19:18.525 --> 19:21.194
Open the door!
[Speaking foreign language]

19:21.228 --> 19:22.528
Can you understand
what he's saying?

19:22.563 --> 19:26.165
[Kicking door]

19:26.200 --> 19:28.167
[Grunting] Aah!

19:28.202 --> 19:29.768
[Shouts indistinctly]

19:29.803 --> 19:32.037
Who is that?
Who are you talking to?

19:32.072 --> 19:33.439
What were you saying?!

19:33.474 --> 19:35.208
[Exhaling]

19:35.242 --> 19:36.909
What was he saying?

19:36.943 --> 19:40.480
He said, "they know,
and it'll all be over soon."

19:47.271 --> 19:49.439
Yo, Beckett, I just got off
with Homeland Security.

19:49.473 --> 19:51.007
The number that Haddad
was calling

19:51.042 --> 19:52.275
was traced
to his Syrian mobile account.

19:52.310 --> 19:53.543
Castle, did you hear that?

19:53.577 --> 19:55.345
Yeah. Do we know
who he was calling?

19:55.379 --> 19:57.113
No. State's trying to coordinate

19:57.148 --> 20:00.136
with the Syrian government, but they're
not expecting any kind of cooperation.

20:00.156 --> 20:01.551
You are making a mistake!

20:01.585 --> 20:03.018
I have rights!

20:03.053 --> 20:04.720
Debbie:
Okay, we checked his seat

20:04.755 --> 20:06.288
and his carry-on, and there's
no sign of a gun.

20:06.323 --> 20:08.090
Beckett, we can't find the gun.

20:08.124 --> 20:09.291
Well, he might have
hidden it somewhere.

20:09.326 --> 20:11.260
Or he has a partner
who is on board.

20:11.294 --> 20:13.395
Either way, Castle, you're gonna
have to interrogate him.

20:13.430 --> 20:14.497
Me?

20:14.531 --> 20:17.232
You've been with me
in hundreds of interrogations.

20:17.267 --> 20:19.435
Yeah, just never when
my life depended on it,

20:19.469 --> 20:20.735
along with everyone else's.

20:20.770 --> 20:23.038
Hey, guys, I have more bad news.

20:23.073 --> 20:24.273
According to the airline,

20:24.307 --> 20:26.075
Haddad has a checked bag
on the flight.

20:26.109 --> 20:28.710
F.B.I. needs you
to locate and search it.

20:28.744 --> 20:30.545
Great. And if we find something?

20:30.580 --> 20:32.080
In the event there's
an explosive device,

20:32.114 --> 20:33.755
the bomb squad will
talk you through it.

20:33.775 --> 20:34.716
[Exhales sharply]

20:34.750 --> 20:36.718
[Lowered voice]
We need to find his luggage.

20:36.752 --> 20:38.386
- I'll go with you.
- No, no, no. I need you and Farrah

20:38.420 --> 20:40.221
upstairs keeping things calm.

20:40.255 --> 20:42.439
The passengers are
starting to ask questions.

20:42.459 --> 20:43.458
What did you tell them?

20:43.493 --> 20:44.759
That a gentleman had
too much to drink,

20:44.794 --> 20:46.433
but I'm not sure
they believed me.

20:46.453 --> 20:50.431
I'll go. The faster we find it,
the safer we'll be.

20:50.466 --> 20:52.400
All right. [Sighs]

20:52.434 --> 20:53.534
Wish me luck.

20:53.568 --> 20:56.270
You don't need it. You've done
this a million times.

20:56.305 --> 20:58.639
I'll let you know
if I find anything.

20:58.673 --> 21:01.275
Please. This is all
a terrible mistake.

21:01.310 --> 21:02.477
What's your name?

21:02.511 --> 21:04.378
Isadore Baldon.

21:04.398 --> 21:08.387
Maybe we should try this again.
We know you are Aiman Haddad

21:08.407 --> 21:10.818
and that you have ties
with I.S.I.S.

21:10.852 --> 21:13.719
Now what is your plan,
and who are you working with?

21:14.165 --> 21:16.356
I don't know what you're
talking about.

21:16.391 --> 21:18.358
"They know, and it'll
all be over soon."

21:18.393 --> 21:20.494
That's what you said
upstairs on the phone.

21:20.529 --> 21:22.639
So who were you talking to?

21:23.164 --> 21:25.032
Why should I answer

21:25.066 --> 21:27.790
when I can see
you won't believe me?

21:30.171 --> 21:31.610
Through here.

21:31.630 --> 21:34.374
Anything like this ever
happen on a flight before?

21:34.409 --> 21:36.476
Closest I came was a 90-year-old

21:36.511 --> 21:38.183
who had a heart attack.

21:38.203 --> 21:40.479
Luckily,
that one had a happy ending.

21:40.514 --> 21:41.881
- This one will, too.
- Yeah?

21:41.916 --> 21:43.382
How long have you been
doing this?

21:43.417 --> 21:46.719
30 years.
Thought I'd seen it all...

21:46.754 --> 21:50.222
every crazy passenger,
every country.

21:50.257 --> 21:51.754
Now this.

21:51.774 --> 21:53.526
If anyone can figure it out,
my dad can.

21:53.561 --> 21:55.394
Mm. Good thing
he's on this flight.

21:55.429 --> 21:57.563
You're lucky to have
family like that.

21:57.597 --> 21:58.864
Yeah. I guess I am.

21:58.898 --> 22:01.167
What about you? You have kids?

22:01.201 --> 22:05.003
Ah, what can I say?
I was always up in the air.

22:06.406 --> 22:10.355
Got it. Isadore Baldon.
This is his bag.

22:22.372 --> 22:25.591
Now, I'm not a cop,
and I'm not an air marshal,

22:25.625 --> 22:27.839
but I'm gonna find out
what you're up to.

22:27.859 --> 22:29.837
Do you know why?

22:31.097 --> 22:33.664
Because my daughter
is on this plane,

22:33.699 --> 22:38.035
and I'm not going to let
anything happen to her.

22:38.070 --> 22:39.404
I am not a terrorist.

22:39.438 --> 22:40.781
You're on the no-fly list.

22:40.801 --> 22:43.274
Only because my idiot cousin
decided to join I.S.I.S.

22:43.309 --> 22:45.509
You're flying
on a stolen passport.

22:45.543 --> 22:46.777
I couldn't travel
under my own name,

22:46.812 --> 22:48.579
so how else should I fly?

22:48.614 --> 22:51.848
Why the sudden urgency
to fly in the first place?

22:52.550 --> 22:54.018
I need to go back to Syria.

22:54.052 --> 22:55.620
Why? What's your mission?

22:55.654 --> 22:57.121
My mission?

22:57.155 --> 22:59.189
I have to go home.

22:59.224 --> 23:02.559
My mother is very sick.
Pancreatic cancer.

23:02.594 --> 23:04.528
I petitioned the T.S.A.

23:04.562 --> 23:06.597
I went through
the proper channels.

23:06.631 --> 23:09.233
But now she only has
a few weeks to live.

23:09.267 --> 23:12.802
She is the one I was
talking to on the phone.

23:12.837 --> 23:14.538
Explain this.

23:14.572 --> 23:17.373
See how the air marshal is
staring right at you?

23:17.407 --> 23:19.976
He's the air marshal?

23:20.011 --> 23:22.078
He saw I was nervous, didn't he?

23:22.113 --> 23:23.579
Is he the reason
I'm being detained?

23:23.614 --> 23:25.949
Yeah, you might say that.

23:25.983 --> 23:28.618
He realized you were
up to something,

23:28.653 --> 23:30.754
so you followed him
to the back of the plane

23:30.788 --> 23:32.488
and you killed him.

23:32.523 --> 23:35.324
Killed him? What do you mean?

23:35.359 --> 23:37.527
We found him right over there.

23:39.095 --> 23:42.165
No. No, no, no, no, no!
No, no! In fact,

23:42.199 --> 23:44.667
seconds after that, this man
got numerous texts on his phone

23:44.701 --> 23:47.570
and then began texting back,
and then he rushed off.

23:47.604 --> 23:50.615
Look, this is the last
I saw of him.

23:50.635 --> 23:53.075
We have his phone, Haddad.

23:53.109 --> 23:54.643
He only sent one text.

23:54.678 --> 23:56.578
No, I know what I saw.

23:56.612 --> 23:59.848
He got a bunch of texts,
five at least.

23:59.883 --> 24:01.684
Alexis: Dad?

24:01.718 --> 24:04.099
Could I see you for a second?

24:09.625 --> 24:11.326
Anything?

24:11.360 --> 24:13.161
We checked his luggage.

24:13.196 --> 24:14.496
No gun, no device,

24:14.530 --> 24:17.327
nothing that speaks
to terrorism.

24:21.337 --> 24:24.172
Look, state can confirm
the story about the sick mother,

24:24.206 --> 24:25.873
but part of Haddad's story
checks out.

24:25.908 --> 24:27.508
Turns out that air marshal Ford

24:27.542 --> 24:29.310
had a second phone
on the flight.

24:29.344 --> 24:30.644
It was his personal cell.

24:30.679 --> 24:33.314
Well, we didn't find
a second phone on the body.

24:33.348 --> 24:35.116
Well, if it had evidence on it,
it's possible

24:35.150 --> 24:36.517
the killer removed it.

24:36.551 --> 24:38.686
Can we recover his texts
without the phone?

24:38.721 --> 24:41.021
Yeah, but it's gonna
take some time

24:41.055 --> 24:42.723
to get the phone company
to release them.

24:42.757 --> 24:44.625
And time is something
we don't have.

24:44.659 --> 24:47.160
And none of this clears Haddad.
This could all be a smokescreen.

24:47.195 --> 24:48.562
Esposito: Something
for us to chase

24:48.597 --> 24:49.730
while his real plan unfolds.

24:49.764 --> 24:52.065
We need that phone.

24:52.100 --> 24:54.235
If Ford was texting,
he must have been connected

24:54.269 --> 24:55.703
to the plane's wifi.

24:55.737 --> 24:58.338
Which means the phone may
still be connected.

24:58.372 --> 25:00.406
Right. So can Tory ping his cell

25:00.441 --> 25:04.577
using the "find my users" app,
make it beep?

25:04.612 --> 25:06.980
[Beep] Okay, I'm in.

25:07.014 --> 25:08.681
I've linked his number
into the app.

25:08.716 --> 25:10.250
Ready to ping when you are.

25:10.284 --> 25:12.652
Okay, stand by.

25:12.686 --> 25:15.087
All right, everyone ready?

25:15.122 --> 25:17.523
Ready. Farrah and I
are in coach,

25:17.558 --> 25:19.525
and Jim is in first class.

25:19.560 --> 25:21.861
Watch for anyone reaching
for their phone.

25:21.895 --> 25:25.498
Ford's phone could be in the
killer's hands. Mm-hmm.

25:26.767 --> 25:28.167
Okay.

25:28.201 --> 25:29.769
Go.

25:29.803 --> 25:30.870
Pinging now.

25:36.877 --> 25:37.877
Over there.

25:40.613 --> 25:42.148
False alarm.

25:49.555 --> 25:50.589
Do you hear anything?

25:51.791 --> 25:54.293
If someone removed the battery

25:54.327 --> 25:57.529
or even turned it off, Tory's not
gonna be able... [Pinging]

25:57.563 --> 25:59.398
I have something.

25:59.432 --> 26:01.566
[Pinging continues]
Where is it?

26:03.769 --> 26:08.606
[Pinging continues]

26:09.741 --> 26:11.542
Oh, crap.

26:11.576 --> 26:12.643
[Hissing]
[Pinging continues]

26:12.678 --> 26:14.813
I hate snakes.

26:14.847 --> 26:17.081
How long does it take a snake to
pass a... [Gasps] There it is.

26:17.116 --> 26:19.617
[Pinging continues]
Oh, thank God. Okay.

26:19.651 --> 26:22.119
[Pinging continues]

26:22.153 --> 26:24.522
It's locked.
We need his pass code.

26:26.758 --> 26:28.793
Or his fingerprint.

26:33.807 --> 26:37.634
I am... So sorry about this,

26:37.668 --> 26:39.903
and thank you for
your service to our country.

26:39.938 --> 26:41.805
[Chimes] Okay.

26:41.840 --> 26:43.573
What's it say?
[Sighs]

26:43.607 --> 26:45.843
It's got at least
a dozen texts on here.

26:45.877 --> 26:47.244
You see? I told you.

26:47.278 --> 26:48.778
[Exhales]

26:48.813 --> 26:50.814
"Hey, sexy, wanna have
some fun?" Who is this?

26:50.849 --> 26:53.249
"Meet me in the back
of the plane and find out."

26:53.283 --> 26:55.084
But then when they refuse
to reveal their identity,

26:55.118 --> 26:57.920
Ford won't meet. Look. The
texts start to get hostile.

26:57.955 --> 27:00.423
"Do what I say, or you'll have
a situation on your hands."

27:00.458 --> 27:03.693
"What kind of situation?" "The
kind you're hired to prevent."

27:03.728 --> 27:05.928
"It's a federal offense to
threaten an aircraft."

27:05.963 --> 27:07.464
"It's not a threat
if I follow through

27:07.498 --> 27:09.431
and take down this plane."

27:09.466 --> 27:12.969
Whoever's behind this
is still on the plane.

27:17.014 --> 27:18.861
- Beckett, I've got something.
- Yeah, hold on.

27:18.881 --> 27:20.782
Those texts on the marshal's
phone, they were sent

27:20.817 --> 27:22.801
- from a pre-paid cell.
- Can you trace it?

27:22.821 --> 27:24.267
No, it looks like
it's been turned off.

27:24.287 --> 27:26.021
Okay, run down that number.
See if you can find out

27:26.055 --> 27:28.089
who bought it and from where.
Castle?

27:28.124 --> 27:30.358
- You still there?
- Yeah, I'm here.

27:30.393 --> 27:32.126
Whoever's behind this
did their homework.

27:32.160 --> 27:33.127
They had Ford's personal number

27:33.161 --> 27:35.162
and they knew exactly
how to manipulate him.

27:35.196 --> 27:36.964
They must have known him
somehow.

27:36.998 --> 27:38.365
I've got the boys digging
into Ford's life...

27:38.400 --> 27:40.034
financials, movements,
phone records.

27:40.068 --> 27:41.469
They're looking for anything
that'll connect him

27:41.503 --> 27:42.804
to someone on that flight.

27:42.838 --> 27:44.038
Well, tell them to dig
a little faster

27:44.072 --> 27:47.407
before our texter makes good
on his threat to take us down.

27:48.240 --> 27:50.547
[Stammers] Castle, I...

27:50.567 --> 27:52.212
I know. Me, too.

27:52.247 --> 27:53.981
Call me when you have something.

27:54.015 --> 27:55.382
Okay.

27:55.417 --> 27:56.631
[Beep]

27:56.651 --> 27:58.619
We can't just sit around
and wait for word

27:58.653 --> 28:00.153
from the precinct.

28:00.187 --> 28:01.455
There has to be something
we can do.

28:01.489 --> 28:02.856
Well, maybe there is.

28:02.890 --> 28:06.126
Only 10% of the population
is left-handed.

28:06.160 --> 28:08.694
There must be a way for us to
figure out who of the passengers

28:08.729 --> 28:11.197
is a southpaw, thus narrowing
our suspect pool.

28:11.232 --> 28:14.000
We could pass out customs
and immigration forms.

28:14.034 --> 28:16.202
Then we'd know
who's left-handed.

28:16.237 --> 28:20.027
Brilliant. Now you're thinking
like a mystery writer.

28:27.581 --> 28:29.982
- Think this will work?
- I don't know.

28:30.016 --> 28:33.319
It's better than doing nothing.

28:33.353 --> 28:34.820
Hey.

28:34.854 --> 28:37.990
Too bad we didn't sleep
through this, too, huh?

28:54.176 --> 28:56.240
Just making sure
it's still there.

28:56.275 --> 28:58.176
[Mouths word]

28:59.378 --> 29:00.978
Beckett, I got it.

29:01.013 --> 29:02.814
The phone that texted
the marshal...

29:02.848 --> 29:04.416
the phone was purchased online
and picked up at the airport

29:04.450 --> 29:05.983
at a flight tech express store

29:06.018 --> 29:07.552
less than half an hour
before the flight.

29:07.586 --> 29:09.321
Does the store have any cameras?

29:09.355 --> 29:10.755
No, and the cameras
in the airport

29:10.790 --> 29:12.423
don't have a good angle
on the register.

29:12.457 --> 29:13.590
But we don't need video.

29:13.625 --> 29:14.625
The purchaser used
a credit card.

29:14.659 --> 29:16.393
We have her name,
and I checked the manifest.

29:16.428 --> 29:18.107
She's on the plane.

29:19.865 --> 29:21.398
Marilyn Singer?

29:21.433 --> 29:23.534
Yeah,
she's a former oceanic executive

29:23.568 --> 29:25.903
who got fired last year,
and, Castle, get this.

29:25.938 --> 29:29.540
She filed a wrongful termination
suit accusing the airline

29:29.574 --> 29:32.209
of blackballing her,
and last week the judge

29:32.243 --> 29:34.878
ruled against her
in favor of Oceanic Airlines.

29:34.898 --> 29:37.348
So she wants to...

29:37.382 --> 29:38.882
[lowered voice]
So she wants to take down

29:38.916 --> 29:40.250
one of their planes for revenge?

29:40.284 --> 29:41.585
That seems a little extreme.

29:41.619 --> 29:43.687
Yes, Castle, but it's consistent
with the texts

29:43.722 --> 29:45.388
she sent the air marshal.

29:45.422 --> 29:47.023
And what better way for her
to destroy the airline

29:47.058 --> 29:49.342
she believes ruined her life?

29:50.794 --> 29:53.596
[Unfastens seat belt]
What seat is she in?

29:53.630 --> 29:56.032
Alexis: [Lowered voice]
That's Marilyn?

29:56.067 --> 29:57.633
The hair, the glasses...

29:57.668 --> 29:59.535
she did not want
to be recognized.

29:59.570 --> 30:02.972
Dad, left hand. It's her.

30:03.006 --> 30:05.708
Okay, we need to isolate her
before she carries out

30:05.743 --> 30:07.943
- whatever her plan is.
- How?

30:07.978 --> 30:09.912
Go to your seat.

30:09.946 --> 30:11.313
What are you gonna do?

30:11.348 --> 30:12.915
Something very stupid.

30:12.949 --> 30:13.983
She has a gun.

30:14.017 --> 30:16.586
Which is why I want you
as far away as possible.

30:16.620 --> 30:18.087
You know I feel the same way
about you, right?

30:18.121 --> 30:20.395
I do, I do. Now... [Kisses]

30:20.415 --> 30:22.858
Go back to your seat. Please.

30:25.281 --> 30:27.429
I'm gonna need a glass of wine.

30:28.853 --> 30:30.889
Red.

30:43.379 --> 30:44.646
- [Gasps] Oh!
- Oh!

30:44.680 --> 30:46.615
Oh, my... I am so sorry.

30:46.649 --> 30:48.082
My apologies, ma'am.

30:48.117 --> 30:49.651
[Gasps] I have stain
remover in the galley.

30:49.685 --> 30:50.718
- Come with me. We'll clean you up.
- Yeah.

30:50.752 --> 30:53.521
Thank you, no, I've got
detergent wipes in my bag.

30:53.555 --> 30:54.989
Ma'am, you don't want that
to set.

30:55.024 --> 30:56.657
Come back with me,
and we'll take care of it.

30:56.691 --> 30:57.992
Don't touch me. I'm fine.

30:58.027 --> 31:00.594
- Maybe you should go with her.
- I said I'm fine.

31:02.164 --> 31:03.864
- Gun!
- Ahh! Ahh!

31:03.899 --> 31:05.934
Oh, my God! Aah!
[Passengers screaming]

31:05.968 --> 31:08.502
[Passengers murmuring]

31:08.537 --> 31:11.338
[Gasping]

31:11.372 --> 31:14.708
Uh... Ladies and gentlemen,
please remain seated.

31:14.743 --> 31:18.813
We obviously had a situation,
but we have it under control.

31:18.847 --> 31:20.648
I'm telling you,
this is some kind of mistake.

31:20.682 --> 31:22.450
That gun is not mine.

31:22.484 --> 31:23.817
What was your plan, Marilyn?

31:23.851 --> 31:25.986
Take hostages, try to
bring down the plane?

31:26.020 --> 31:27.821
[Huffs] Bring down the plane?

31:27.855 --> 31:29.990
What the hell are you
talking about?

31:30.024 --> 31:32.359
I'm talking about the suit
you lost against Oceanic,

31:32.393 --> 31:34.894
and the threatening texts
you sent from this phone.

31:34.929 --> 31:36.830
That is not my phone.

31:36.864 --> 31:39.609
It was in your purse,
paid for with your credit card.

31:40.423 --> 31:43.002
Where's Kyle?
I want to talk to Kyle.

31:43.036 --> 31:45.538
I know he's the air marshal
on this flight.

31:45.573 --> 31:48.675
Did he put you up to this?
Because it is not funny.

31:48.709 --> 31:51.678
How is it that you know
Mr. Ford?

31:54.682 --> 31:57.716
He's my boyfriend, all right?

31:57.750 --> 31:59.685
And if he thinks he's
teaching me a lesson,

31:59.719 --> 32:01.689
I'm going to be
seriously pissed.

32:01.709 --> 32:03.861
Now where is he?

32:03.881 --> 32:06.092
Marilyn...

32:06.126 --> 32:07.880
Kyle is dead.

32:11.798 --> 32:13.031
Dead?

32:14.337 --> 32:17.226
Kyle's dead? How?

32:17.246 --> 32:18.604
You should know.

32:18.638 --> 32:20.138
His gun was in your purse.

32:20.173 --> 32:22.374
No. I...

32:22.409 --> 32:24.810
I-I don't understand
what's going on.

32:24.844 --> 32:27.713
Someone else must have put that
in my bag with the phone

32:27.747 --> 32:30.525
when I was in the bathroom.

32:31.317 --> 32:33.819
And I suppose you always
wear a wig when you travel?

32:33.853 --> 32:36.321
You don't understand.
I thought...

32:36.355 --> 32:38.489
I thought Kyle was having
an affair.

32:39.090 --> 32:41.059
It was our 6-month anniversary,

32:41.094 --> 32:43.929
and we were supposed to
go away for the weekend.

32:43.963 --> 32:46.464
But at the last minute,
Kyle called

32:46.498 --> 32:48.266
and said he had to work
this flight,

32:48.300 --> 32:51.302
that he had to fill in
for someone.

32:51.337 --> 32:53.438
But there was something
in his voice,

32:53.472 --> 32:56.006
like he wasn't telling me
the whole story.

32:56.041 --> 32:59.444
So you decided to stalk him,
follow him onto this plane?

32:59.478 --> 33:01.279
We met in the air.

33:01.313 --> 33:03.647
Fell in love on the long haul.

33:03.681 --> 33:06.350
I thought maybe he'd
found someone else.

33:06.384 --> 33:09.586
Is that why you lured him
back here? To confront him?

33:09.621 --> 33:11.922
And when it all went south,
you killed him in a rage?

33:11.957 --> 33:13.090
No.

33:13.125 --> 33:15.826
I wouldn't do that. Please.

33:15.861 --> 33:17.962
You have to believe me.

33:17.996 --> 33:19.696
I can't afford to.

33:19.731 --> 33:23.333
Jim, take her down below.
Make sure she's secure.

33:25.637 --> 33:28.004
[Breathes sharply]

33:34.887 --> 33:36.512
What's wrong?

33:36.546 --> 33:38.314
I don't know. Just...

33:38.348 --> 33:40.150
when I told her Ford was dead,

33:40.184 --> 33:42.451
her reaction seemed so real.

33:42.486 --> 33:44.821
Dad, the gun and phone
were in her purse.

33:44.855 --> 33:46.555
She's left-handed. I...

33:46.590 --> 33:47.991
no, I know, I know.
Everything fits.

33:48.025 --> 33:50.059
But why buy
a pre-paid phone online

33:50.094 --> 33:51.894
just to pick it up
at the airport store

33:51.928 --> 33:53.562
minutes later?

33:53.597 --> 33:55.030
Why not just walk into
the store and buy it?

33:55.064 --> 33:56.399
And why use a credit card
that could be traced

33:56.433 --> 33:58.567
back to her, unless...

33:58.602 --> 34:01.018
Unless that was
part of the plan?

34:01.905 --> 34:03.706
To give us the perfect suspect

34:03.740 --> 34:06.475
so we'd stop looking
for the truth.

34:06.510 --> 34:08.987
You think someone set her up?

34:10.612 --> 34:13.447
I think something else
is going on here.

34:18.319 --> 34:20.300
<i>Look, Castle, you've been
through a lot up there,</i>

34:20.320 --> 34:22.188
<i>so maybe your storyteller's
imagination's</i>

34:22.222 --> 34:24.172
- getting the best of you.
- I'm telling you,

34:24.193 --> 34:26.072
there's a lot more
going on here.

34:26.092 --> 34:29.226
<i>Someone wants us to think
this is over, but it's not.</i>

34:29.262 --> 34:30.527
Castle may be right.

34:30.563 --> 34:31.996
We contacted
the air marshal service.

34:32.030 --> 34:33.797
Ford wasn't filling in
for anyone.

34:33.831 --> 34:35.400
<i>He requested to be
on that flight.</i>

34:35.434 --> 34:37.902
<i>Ryan: We also double-checked
Ford's financial records,</i>

34:37.936 --> 34:41.005
<i>and we found a transaction
that just posted.</i>

34:41.039 --> 34:44.876
<i>It turns out $9,950
was wired to his bank account</i>

34:44.909 --> 34:46.342
<i>just minutes before takeoff.</i>

34:46.378 --> 34:48.246
Just under the $10,000 mark.

34:48.280 --> 34:50.148
Someone didn't want
to tip off the feds.

34:50.181 --> 34:52.516
<i>Whatever's going on up there,
Ford is involved.</i>

34:52.550 --> 34:54.085
Who's the money from?

34:54.119 --> 34:56.888
<i>This guy...
Victor Kristoph Dietrich.</i>

34:56.922 --> 34:59.657
<i>He's a wealthy
German industrialist,</i>

34:59.691 --> 35:01.525
<i>big name in the import/export
business.</i>

35:01.559 --> 35:03.093
U.S. customs officials
have flagged him

35:03.127 --> 35:05.896
several times for violations,
but nothing ever stuck.

35:05.930 --> 35:08.198
<i>Do you think Ford requested
to be on this flight</i>

35:08.232 --> 35:09.933
<i>because Dietrich paid him
to be on it?</i>

35:09.967 --> 35:11.368
<i>Yes, but why?</i>

35:11.403 --> 35:12.670
Where is Dietrich?

35:12.704 --> 35:14.237
His office is two blocks away.

35:14.272 --> 35:16.712
- I want him here. Now.
- Yeah.

35:18.642 --> 35:21.377
I am sorry, detectives,
but I've never seen him before.

35:21.412 --> 35:23.680
Then why was $10,000 transferred
from your bank account

35:23.714 --> 35:25.515
to his, Mr. Dietrich?

35:25.549 --> 35:28.018
- Must be some kind of banking error.
- No, it's not.

35:28.052 --> 35:30.998
Both of your financial
institutions confirmed it.

35:32.056 --> 35:33.690
It isn't a crime to give a gift.

35:33.724 --> 35:35.558
Oh, so it's a gift now?

35:35.592 --> 35:37.126
To someone that
you don't even know?

35:37.160 --> 35:40.918
What were you paying
the air marshal for, Mr. Dietrich?

35:40.938 --> 35:43.299
This has been delightful,
but I'm afraid I have to go.

35:43.334 --> 35:46.235
Um, no. You're...
you're not going anywhere.

35:46.269 --> 35:47.970
You have no cause to hold me.

35:48.004 --> 35:50.139
Actually, we do.

35:50.173 --> 35:51.307
As a material witness.

35:51.341 --> 35:52.908
Witness to what?

35:52.943 --> 35:54.376
The murder of a federal
air marshal

35:54.410 --> 35:56.520
on a transatlantic flight.

35:56.980 --> 35:59.148
Murder?

35:59.182 --> 36:00.449
Air marshal Ford is... is dead?

36:00.483 --> 36:03.191
Yes. Now what was the money for?

36:05.285 --> 36:06.989
Security.

36:07.960 --> 36:09.458
What kind of security?

36:09.492 --> 36:11.960
I consult with Brampton's
auction house.

36:11.994 --> 36:14.128
I hired Mr. Ford
to provide protection

36:14.163 --> 36:16.164
for a piece we acquired
from the met that was

36:16.198 --> 36:17.999
being transported on that plane.

36:18.033 --> 36:19.434
What kind of a piece?

36:19.469 --> 36:22.070
It is an art deco era

36:22.104 --> 36:26.698
Louis callay celestialis watch
worth $13.3 million.

36:27.343 --> 36:28.910
And Ford was carrying it?

36:28.944 --> 36:30.411
He was merely
keeping an eye on it.

36:30.445 --> 36:32.180
One of our in-house apprentices

36:32.214 --> 36:33.915
is actually wearing
the timepiece.

36:33.949 --> 36:36.951
You gave an apprentice
a $13 million watch?

36:36.986 --> 36:40.121
Yeah, it's a common
auction house practice.

36:40.155 --> 36:42.122
They fly an employee
to a foreign country

36:42.156 --> 36:44.024
wearing the goods so that
they don't have to claim it

36:44.058 --> 36:45.259
or pay taxes on it.

36:45.293 --> 36:46.794
With such a valuable piece,

36:46.828 --> 36:47.995
I wanted real security
for the flight,

36:48.029 --> 36:50.664
and Ford was backing up
my courier.

36:50.699 --> 36:52.466
- That was all.
- Except that wasn't all.

36:52.501 --> 36:55.035
- Something went awry.
- Yes.

36:55.069 --> 36:57.337
The courier stopped replying
to my texts

36:57.372 --> 36:59.229
shortly after takeoff.

36:59.442 --> 37:02.542
What was the courier's name,
and where was he sitting?

37:02.576 --> 37:05.645
Aaron Rich? Aaron, wake up.

37:05.679 --> 37:08.148
Hey! I think he's been drugged.
Wake up.

37:08.182 --> 37:10.550
Mr. Castle, what are you doing?
It's part of the investigation.

37:10.584 --> 37:12.819
- The suspect is in custody.
- Maybe not.

37:12.853 --> 37:14.186
No. No. No, no, no, no.

37:14.221 --> 37:16.122
I wasn't supposed
to fall asleep.

37:17.391 --> 37:18.658
Thank God.

37:18.692 --> 37:21.027
Hey. Hey! Let go of me!

37:21.061 --> 37:23.029
Don't thank God just yet.

37:23.063 --> 37:24.363
This watch is a fake.

37:24.398 --> 37:26.032
The real celestialis
is self-winding.

37:26.066 --> 37:27.667
This watch has a knob.

37:27.701 --> 37:30.469
Which means this was never
about terrorism,

37:30.503 --> 37:32.805
it was about a heist.

37:32.839 --> 37:34.073
I don't... I don't understand.

37:34.107 --> 37:35.041
You're wearing a knockoff.

37:35.075 --> 37:37.143
It got switched out
while you were sleeping.

37:37.177 --> 37:38.978
You weren't supposed
to realize it

37:39.012 --> 37:40.212
until you were off the plane

37:40.247 --> 37:41.981
and the real watch
was long gone.

37:42.015 --> 37:44.383
That obnoxious guy
who had his seat changed.

37:44.418 --> 37:46.152
Was this originally where
he was supposed to sit?

37:46.186 --> 37:48.487
Yes, but Mr. Ford put in
a request for that seat

37:48.521 --> 37:50.589
two days ago, and air marshals
get priority,

37:50.623 --> 37:52.357
so the system assigned it
to him.

37:52.391 --> 37:54.225
He knew it was
the perfect vantage point

37:54.260 --> 37:55.427
from which to watch the watch.

37:55.462 --> 37:56.595
But the thief
must have found out.

37:56.629 --> 37:58.396
And they couldn't steal
the watch with an air marshal

37:58.431 --> 38:00.766
sitting right there,
so they had to lure Ford

38:00.800 --> 38:02.200
out of first class.

38:02.234 --> 38:04.169
Using a phone that, if traced,

38:04.203 --> 38:06.171
would lead them back
to Ford's girlfriend,

38:06.205 --> 38:07.238
who had a motive.

38:07.273 --> 38:10.275
Dad, that means the thief
knows who's on the plane.

38:10.309 --> 38:12.877
They had access to the manifest,
seat assignments,

38:12.911 --> 38:14.279
Ford's personal life.

38:14.313 --> 38:16.547
And passenger credit cards.

38:17.196 --> 38:19.184
This was an inside job.

38:19.218 --> 38:21.251
Aaron, who served you
this drink?

38:21.286 --> 38:22.753
Because someone spiked it.

38:22.788 --> 38:25.055
I can't remember.

38:25.090 --> 38:26.357
But it's usually her.

38:26.391 --> 38:29.293
No. No. I did not drug anybody.

38:29.327 --> 38:30.928
Dad, she couldn't have.

38:30.963 --> 38:33.364
She was serving us
over in aisle 2.

38:33.398 --> 38:35.299
Well, then it was...

38:35.333 --> 38:37.734
[Passengers gasping]

38:37.768 --> 38:39.844
Stay back.

38:40.671 --> 38:42.672
- Debbie?
- Mm-hmm?

38:43.808 --> 38:45.209
You?

38:45.243 --> 38:46.477
Mm-hmm.

38:46.960 --> 38:48.628
Why?

38:49.481 --> 38:52.749
30 years, Farrah.

38:52.783 --> 38:54.217
30 years

38:54.251 --> 38:56.386
of loyal service.

38:56.420 --> 38:58.488
I was finally ready to retire.

38:58.523 --> 39:01.257
So what does Oceanic do?

39:01.291 --> 39:03.960
They restructure...
[Chuckles dryly]

39:03.995 --> 39:05.461
And eliminate our pensions.

39:05.496 --> 39:07.597
Debbie...

39:07.632 --> 39:09.732
You don't want to do this.
Drop this gun.

39:09.766 --> 39:11.167
Hmm.

39:11.201 --> 39:13.136
Do you have any idea
what it's like

39:13.170 --> 39:17.006
serving this little punk kid
in first class every month?

39:17.041 --> 39:19.108
Hearing him brag about
how much money

39:19.143 --> 39:21.602
he's got strapped to his wrist.

39:21.622 --> 39:24.147
When I have nothing.

39:25.945 --> 39:29.251
So when you found out he was
taking this flight again,

39:29.285 --> 39:30.953
you decided to do something.

39:30.987 --> 39:33.255
I heard about that watch.

39:33.289 --> 39:34.489
How it was gonna be
auctioned off.

39:34.524 --> 39:36.491
That's $13 million!

39:37.661 --> 39:39.361
But nobody...

39:39.395 --> 39:42.230
Nobody was supposed to get hurt.

39:43.841 --> 39:45.967
All right, I j... I just needed
Ford to step away

39:46.001 --> 39:47.769
from him for like a minute.

39:47.803 --> 39:50.919
But when he saw Aaron
was sleeping...

39:52.160 --> 39:54.448
He knew.

39:54.843 --> 39:57.112
He tracked me down
to the cargo hold.

39:57.146 --> 39:58.680
Debbie...
[Sobs softly]

39:58.714 --> 40:00.448
What the airline did to you

40:00.482 --> 40:02.458
was unfair.

40:02.807 --> 40:05.890
But please don't make it worse.

40:06.722 --> 40:09.290
This isn't who you are.

40:09.324 --> 40:12.259
[Voice breaking]
It's not. It's not.

40:23.171 --> 40:24.671
[Exhales]

40:24.706 --> 40:27.641
[Breathes unevenly]

40:29.611 --> 40:31.345
[Ties tighten]

40:31.379 --> 40:33.379
[Ties click]
We'll be landing soon.

40:33.414 --> 40:35.882
You can go ahead
and re-take your seat...

40:35.917 --> 40:38.752
With our apologies.

40:39.705 --> 40:42.255
Thank you for believing me,
Mr. Castle,

40:42.289 --> 40:44.725
and for bringing
Kyle's killer to justice.

40:44.759 --> 40:47.538
I'm... I'm very sorry
for your loss.

40:48.857 --> 40:51.344
Mr. Haddad.

40:51.887 --> 40:54.234
Unfortunately,
when the plane lands,

40:54.268 --> 40:55.101
you are going to be detained

40:55.136 --> 40:57.703
for traveling
on a stolen passport.

40:57.738 --> 41:01.274
However, I had my friends
in New York make some calls.

41:01.308 --> 41:03.409
If your story checks out,

41:03.444 --> 41:05.410
the authorities here
are going to allow you

41:05.445 --> 41:06.345
to travel to Syria
to see your family

41:06.379 --> 41:08.413
before you face charges.
[Exhales sharply]

41:08.448 --> 41:10.916
Thank you, Mr. Castle.

41:11.495 --> 41:13.585
Be safe.

41:18.324 --> 41:20.059
And you.

41:20.783 --> 41:23.862
I am very proud of the way
you handled yourself today.

41:24.185 --> 41:26.565
What you said to Debbie,
it was...

41:26.599 --> 41:27.966
Very brave.

41:27.986 --> 41:29.301
Thanks.

41:29.770 --> 41:32.704
You know, I think I'm going
to postpone my pub date.

41:32.738 --> 41:34.473
You are?

41:34.734 --> 41:37.709
I thought you said you didn't
want to be attached at the hip.

41:37.743 --> 41:40.779
Yeah. Well, after
what happened today,

41:40.813 --> 41:43.048
- I kind of do.
- Me, too.

41:43.082 --> 41:44.649
[Sighs]

41:44.684 --> 41:46.484
<i>Edmunds over P.A.:
Folks, this is your captain.</i>

41:46.518 --> 41:49.253
<i>We're starting our final
descent into London Heathrow.</i>

41:49.288 --> 41:50.188
<i>Please take your seats.</i>

41:50.222 --> 41:53.091
<i>We'll have you on the ground
shortly.</i>

41:53.125 --> 41:55.059
[Clink]

42:09.685 --> 42:11.450
[Chimes]

42:12.543 --> 42:14.745
