Daniel was tossing at me,

09:16.055 --> 09:18.224

09:18.307 --> 09:20.476
Then Maddie came over
and was all, "Daniel is mine."

Then suddenly I was all,
"help me."

09:24.605 --> 09:27.775
- Maddie van Pelt?
I should have guessed.

09:27.858 --> 09:28.859
- You know her?

09:28.943 --> 09:31.028
- I know that she's a witch.

09:31.112 --> 09:32.613
Like you.

09:32.697 --> 09:35.157
But I think Maddie might
turn out to be a bad witch.

09:35.241 --> 09:38.244
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

09:38.327 --> 09:39.537

09:42.290 --> 09:44.000
- I know you are.

09:44.083 --> 09:45.376
But don't worry.
So am I.

09:45.459 --> 09:46.419
- Oh, yeah?

09:46.502 --> 09:48.921
- I was sent here
to protect you

09:49.005 --> 09:50.756
and help you become
a better witch.

09:50.840 --> 09:53.134

09:53.217 --> 09:55.636

you are, you do need me,

during the next eclipse.

She was pretty upset.

He can feel my presence.

That guy Mike from the Dolphins

Mike swims slower than Daniel

ridiculous while doing it.

Perhaps with doggie paddle.

an honest guy

on his own.
