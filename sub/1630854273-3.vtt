WEBVTT

00:02.042 --> 00:03.167
-NARRATOR: Tonight...
-Time to dive, let's go!

00:03.250 --> 00:04.542
...on Beyond Oak Island...

00:04.708 --> 00:06.375
I'm convinced Poverty Island's
worth another go.

00:06.500 --> 00:09.292
This year we were able
to get absolute coordinates.

00:09.375 --> 00:10.417
The lighthouse keeper's son

00:10.542 --> 00:11.750
thought they had
discovered something.

00:11.875 --> 00:13.500
Secret Confederate gold

00:13.583 --> 00:15.417
dumped off Poverty Island.

00:15.542 --> 00:17.292
We've got everything we
need to justify a dive.

00:17.375 --> 00:19.750
-What was it?
.45 billion reasons?
-That's right.

00:19.875 --> 00:21.250
Here we go!

00:22.708 --> 00:23.583
Okay, they found something.

00:26.458 --> 00:29.000
-This very well
could be what we seek.
-Yeah.

00:31.542 --> 00:33.250
All the while
we were growing up,

00:33.375 --> 00:36.583
my brother and I were fascinated
with finding treasure.

00:37.833 --> 00:38.750
RICK:
Pirate treasure,

00:38.875 --> 00:40.417
cursed treasure.

00:40.542 --> 00:42.250
Civil War gold.

00:42.375 --> 00:45.042
-(laughter)
-Since then,
our work on Oak Island

00:45.208 --> 00:47.333
has shown us
there's a world of mysteries...

00:47.458 --> 00:50.250
-Whoa.
-...waiting to be explored.

00:50.375 --> 00:53.250
RICK:
So, we like to reach out
to other treasure hunters.

00:53.375 --> 00:55.500
X marks the spot, right there.
Brilliant.

00:55.667 --> 00:57.583
-MARTY: We want to hear
their stories...
-That's right.

00:57.708 --> 01:00.208
-...and share our insights.
-"Ill-gotten gains."

01:00.375 --> 01:01.792
-RICK: And who knows...
-GARY: I got it.

01:01.917 --> 01:03.667
...maybe we can help them
with their search.

01:03.750 --> 01:05.125
MARTY:
Not only in America.

01:05.250 --> 01:06.958
Wow. That is gold.

01:07.083 --> 01:08.875
-RICK: But all over the world.
-Yeah!

01:09.000 --> 01:10.625
MARTY:
<i>Beyond Oak Island.</i>

01:20.042 --> 01:22.292
MARTY: Matty, Rick,
we have a distinguished

01:22.375 --> 01:25.083
visitor that came
all the way to Oak Island

01:25.208 --> 01:26.542
to talk about something

01:26.708 --> 01:29.792
that I have very much
enjoyed: this is Bob Kreipke.

01:29.875 --> 01:31.333
-Hi, Bob.
-Hey, Bob.

01:31.458 --> 01:33.917
Bob was actually the historian,
the corporate historian

01:34.042 --> 01:35.167
for Ford Motor Company.

01:35.292 --> 01:37.333
So, he's very knowledgeable
about archives

01:37.458 --> 01:39.833
and preserving history
and all these sort of things.

01:39.958 --> 01:41.958
Last summer, Bob and I had a...

01:42.083 --> 01:44.000
I guess it would be corny
to call it

01:44.125 --> 01:46.000
a most excellent adventure,
but, but we had

01:46.125 --> 01:48.167
a great adventure,
we had a lot of fun.

01:48.292 --> 01:49.833
I've come to have
a tremendous respect for him.

01:50.000 --> 01:53.250
He has a passion
for this one treasure,

01:53.375 --> 01:55.958
lost treasure,
and the story around it,

01:56.042 --> 01:58.167
which always
appeals to my brother.

01:58.250 --> 02:00.125
The treasure hunt,
it's in our own backyard,

02:00.208 --> 02:02.125
and I think you know
what I'm talking about.

02:02.208 --> 02:03.500
-Poverty Island.
-Poverty Island.

02:03.625 --> 02:06.417
This is one I was hoping
that you were gonna revisit.

02:06.542 --> 02:09.542
-It's incredible.
-This one is just really fun,

02:09.667 --> 02:10.500
but it would add

02:10.583 --> 02:12.500
a real comment
to the history books

02:12.625 --> 02:13.333
as to what happened,

02:13.500 --> 02:15.000
and, and how the Great Lakes

02:15.083 --> 02:16.750
played a role in what you

02:16.875 --> 02:18.875
wouldn't think they would,
and that would be the Civil War.

02:19.042 --> 02:20.458
Absolutely.

02:22.000 --> 02:27.000
NARRATOR: In 1863, at the height
of the American Civil War,

02:27.083 --> 02:30.167
a Union blockade of
all Southern sea ports

02:30.250 --> 02:32.708
was devastating
the Confederate economy.

02:34.042 --> 02:37.375
However, many historians
believe that France,

02:37.542 --> 02:41.167
which was desperate to obtain
Southern shipments of cotton,

02:41.333 --> 02:44.542
was secretly aiding the rebel
cause by smuggling gold

02:44.667 --> 02:48.458
across the Atlantic Ocean
through Northern channels.

02:48.583 --> 02:52.625
Officially, France was
neutral in the Civil War,

02:52.708 --> 02:54.208
but they were
very dependent upon

02:54.333 --> 02:55.750
Confederate cotton.

02:55.875 --> 02:57.167
They were very interested in

02:57.333 --> 02:58.917
having the Confederacy
actually win the war.

03:00.208 --> 03:03.542
In 1863, Napoleon III
allegedly sent $4.5 million

03:03.667 --> 03:05.750
in gold to help
the Confederates.

03:06.833 --> 03:09.417
But the Union Navy
was very, very effective at

03:09.542 --> 03:13.375
blockading the southern ports,
so they decide they're gonna

03:13.500 --> 03:16.292
get this gold to the Confederacy
through the St. Lawrence,

03:16.417 --> 03:17.833
and they would take it
to the Great Lakes and get it

03:17.917 --> 03:20.917
down to Chicago, and from
Chicago, get it to Richmond

03:21.042 --> 03:23.500
on a train or overland.

03:23.625 --> 03:25.167
NARRATOR: One of these
shipments is believed

03:25.292 --> 03:27.042
to have entered
the Northern region

03:27.167 --> 03:30.333
of Lake Michigan near
a 200-acre landmass known

03:30.458 --> 03:34.583
as Poverty Island when it
was detected by a Union vessel.

03:35.875 --> 03:37.500
A desperate chase ensued.

03:38.917 --> 03:42.667
BOB K.:
Legend has it off of Poverty
Island, the ship carrying

03:42.792 --> 03:46.250
the gold said, "The gun boat's
a lot faster than we are;

03:46.375 --> 03:47.667
"we're gonna be overtaken.

03:47.750 --> 03:50.583
We don't want this falling
in the wrong hands."

03:50.708 --> 03:54.333
So they decided to scuttle it
and throw it overboard.

03:56.125 --> 03:57.708
NARRATOR:
According to researchers,

03:57.875 --> 04:01.333
five wooden chests,
linked together by chains

04:01.500 --> 04:03.958
and containing
as much as $400 million

04:04.042 --> 04:06.000
in today's value,

04:06.125 --> 04:07.958
were lost on
the bottom of the lake,

04:08.042 --> 04:11.792
where they remained undisturbed
for nearly seven decades.

04:13.333 --> 04:17.292
But in 1933, a Milwaukee-based
treasure hunter

04:17.417 --> 04:20.250
named Wilfred Behrens
led a search operation

04:20.375 --> 04:23.042
aboard his ship,
known as the <i>Captain Lawrence,</i>

04:23.167 --> 04:26.333
and reportedly located
the sunken chests

04:26.458 --> 04:28.333
using a diving bell drag line,

04:28.458 --> 04:31.417
just offshore
from Poverty Island.

04:31.542 --> 04:35.333
The operation was witnessed
by an 11-year-old named

04:35.458 --> 04:41.583
Karly Jessen, the son of
the island's lighthouse keeper.

04:41.708 --> 04:43.833
watching the <i>Captain Lawrence,</i>
watching the diving bell,

04:43.958 --> 04:45.167
watching the operations.

04:45.292 --> 04:48.542
One day, something unusual
happened on board.

04:48.667 --> 04:50.833
The crew were out there
hooting and hollering.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.500
The lighthouse keeper's son
thought they had

04:52.625 --> 04:54.208
discovered this lost treasure.

04:54.333 --> 04:57.333
(thunder crashing)

04:57.458 --> 05:02.292
Shortly thereafter,
a storm kicks up and he retreats

05:02.375 --> 05:05.292
back to the lighthouse,
and the next morning they go out

05:05.417 --> 05:07.250
and the <i>Captain Lawrence</i>
is no more.

05:08.833 --> 05:12.292
NARRATOR:
A massive storm battered
the boat, causing it,

05:12.417 --> 05:14.250
along with
its salvaged treasure,

05:14.375 --> 05:16.792
to sink within minutes.

05:16.917 --> 05:19.917
Behrens intended to raise
the vessel, but died

05:20.042 --> 05:22.583
before being able to mount
a successful salvage effort.

05:22.708 --> 05:27.167
To this day, many treasure
hunters are convinced

05:27.292 --> 05:28.750
the gold is still out there,

05:28.875 --> 05:32.167
hidden in the frigid waters
of Lake Michigan.

05:32.292 --> 05:34.625
BOB K.:
No one has found that treasure.

05:34.708 --> 05:36.792
I think if you find
the <i>Captain Lawrence,</i>

05:36.875 --> 05:39.333
we can backtrack and say,

05:39.417 --> 05:41.250
you know what,
the treasure's got to be here.

05:41.375 --> 05:44.583
-This is the spot?
-Right here.

05:44.708 --> 05:45.833
NARRATOR:
One year ago,

05:45.917 --> 05:49.125
Marty Lagina joined
historian Bob Kreipke

05:49.208 --> 05:52.500
to search the southern waters
just off Poverty Island

05:52.667 --> 05:55.542
for evidence of
the <i>Captain Lawrence</i> wreckage

05:55.708 --> 05:58.875
and the lost treasure
using sonar technology.

05:59.000 --> 05:59.750
BOB K.:
Okay, on bottom.

05:59.875 --> 06:02.083
NARRATOR:
Although they detected

06:02.208 --> 06:03.917
a mysterious,
square-shaped object...

06:04.042 --> 06:04.875
BOB K.:
I find that unique.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.417
...compelling evidence of

06:06.542 --> 06:10.833
the ship and the five chests
eluded the search operation.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.833
-Bob, there's a lot of treasure
mysteries in the world.
-Yes.

06:13.958 --> 06:16.958
What was it about
Poverty Island that made you so

06:17.083 --> 06:19.333
passionate about it? You've
been working on this for years.

06:19.417 --> 06:23.792
I think the number of clues
that seemed feasible.

06:25.208 --> 06:28.500
Any orchestrated
treasure hunt is based

06:28.583 --> 06:30.792
on, you know, some smoke.

06:30.875 --> 06:33.083
-You know, there's gotta be...
-(laughs)

06:33.208 --> 06:35.083
This one has credence to it.

06:37.542 --> 06:39.375
NARRATOR:
In addition to being a historian

06:39.500 --> 06:41.000
for Ford Motor Company,

06:41.125 --> 06:43.375
where he worked for 44 years,

06:43.500 --> 06:45.833
Bob Kreipke has been fascinated

06:46.000 --> 06:49.167
with the local lore
surrounding lost Civil War gold

06:49.292 --> 06:51.417
in Lake Michigan
for most of his life.

06:51.542 --> 06:53.833
BOB K.: When I was
about 15 years old,

06:53.958 --> 06:57.500
I read some articles about
this Poverty Island treasure.

06:57.583 --> 07:01.417
And because we vacationed
in this area all the time,

07:01.542 --> 07:04.250
I thought, boy, this
would be pretty interesting.

07:04.375 --> 07:08.500
NARRATOR:
His formal research on
the project began in 1977,

07:08.667 --> 07:10.750
and has included a thorough

07:10.875 --> 07:12.792
examination
of shipping records,

07:12.875 --> 07:15.500
weather reports,
and every related document

07:15.583 --> 07:17.750
in Michigan, Wisconsin,

07:17.875 --> 07:21.167
and the National Archives
in Washington, D.C.

07:21.333 --> 07:24.625
The one thing
about Poverty Island is

07:24.708 --> 07:27.333
I believe it's very doable
to search for this treasure.

07:27.500 --> 07:30.667
You have an island that
doesn't move, and um...

07:30.833 --> 07:32.250
Bob, I hate to interrupt you.

07:32.375 --> 07:34.583
I hate to, but I can't help it.

07:34.708 --> 07:36.500
We have an island
that doesn't move, too...

07:36.625 --> 07:39.167
-(laughter)
-...and it hasn't worked
out yet.

07:39.333 --> 07:42.792
-It hasn't helped.
-But there's a big difference.
-Okay.

07:42.917 --> 07:46.000
The difference with
Poverty Island is, guess what?

07:46.083 --> 07:49.000
We don't have to do drilling.
We don't have to do dynamite.

07:49.083 --> 07:52.333
We don't have to do
seismic scans and that.

07:52.458 --> 07:55.167
And you know what treasure
you're looking for.

07:55.333 --> 07:57.875
-Absolutely.
-We don't have that luxury.
-That's true.

07:58.042 --> 07:59.625
Yeah, we know what it
looks like

07:59.708 --> 08:02.917
and it's not going to be
dangerously deep.

08:03.042 --> 08:05.542
Have you ever seen a figure,
has any historian tried to put

08:05.708 --> 08:07.833
a value to it;
is there a range?

08:07.958 --> 08:11.333
Well, some of the articles
that have been written about it

08:11.417 --> 08:14.792
kind of stick on $400 million.

08:14.917 --> 08:19.708
What I contend is you find
the <i>Captain Lawrence.</i>

08:19.833 --> 08:23.917
We know which way the wind
was coming. We backtrack.

08:24.042 --> 08:25.750
And it had to be close enough
so the guy,

08:25.875 --> 08:27.458
-the kid could see it.
-That's right.

08:27.542 --> 08:28.917
And that's another clue.

08:29.042 --> 08:31.500
It couldn't have been
miles away.

08:31.625 --> 08:34.292
It had to be
right in that strait.

08:34.375 --> 08:36.792
And I believe that
that's where it lies.

08:37.833 --> 08:39.417
So, when you guys
went out before...

08:39.542 --> 08:40.667
Yes, Bob and I
have been talking,

08:40.792 --> 08:42.500
and here's
the difference this year.

08:42.625 --> 08:44.500
-Okay.
-The whole thing goes back

08:44.667 --> 08:46.292
to what the young man overheard.

08:46.375 --> 08:50.500
And so, logically, we thought
he would be near the lighthouse.

08:50.667 --> 08:52.625
The lighthouse
is on the south side of

08:52.750 --> 08:53.625
-the island.
-That is correct.

08:53.708 --> 08:55.458
But it didn't match some

08:55.542 --> 08:58.000
of the other things,
so what we were thinking is

08:58.125 --> 09:01.375
a young kid--
If a ship is near his island

09:01.500 --> 09:02.583
and he's bored to death,
and I'm

09:02.708 --> 09:03.667
sure they were
bored to death.

09:03.750 --> 09:05.208
They were bored to death.

09:05.333 --> 09:06.500
They'd follow it around.

09:06.625 --> 09:07.625
So, there's no reason that

09:07.750 --> 09:09.083
the conversation couldn't

09:09.208 --> 09:12.167
have been overheard here
on the north side of the island.

09:12.250 --> 09:16.750
I believe that the captain
didn't want to dump them

09:16.875 --> 09:19.750
where any Tom,
Dick and Harry would find them.

09:19.875 --> 09:23.833
So he had to be deep enough
that it was not an easy task.

09:23.958 --> 09:25.750
But on the other side
of the coin,

09:25.875 --> 09:28.208
he didn't want to get out
in this deep water up here.

09:29.250 --> 09:30.917
So that's why I
think he scuttled it here.

09:31.042 --> 09:33.500
You know, Bob, the thing
that is quite appealing with

09:33.625 --> 09:35.500
this is it's in the backyard.

09:35.625 --> 09:37.917
Yeah. Well, plus, Rick,
you open those chests,

09:38.042 --> 09:40.667
-you're gonna, you're gonna
learn a lot about history,
-Oh, yes.

09:40.792 --> 09:41.958
about what the heck happened.

09:42.042 --> 09:44.333
-Yes.
-Why did so many people

09:44.417 --> 09:47.167
dedicate so much
time and effort--

09:47.333 --> 09:49.333
and money--
to an enterprise?

09:49.500 --> 09:51.208
Right? There has to be
some truth to it.

09:51.375 --> 09:52.542
Absolutely.

09:52.667 --> 09:54.958
I'm convinced that this is
worth another go.

09:55.042 --> 09:56.708
I know a guy
that I can contribute.

09:56.833 --> 09:58.875
His name is Doug Gossage,

09:59.000 --> 10:00.917
and he's a good
underwater device man.

10:01.042 --> 10:03.292
-He's gonna get us
a magnetometer.
-That'd be great.

10:03.417 --> 10:05.375
MARTY: So, we might be able
to pin it down a little bit.

10:05.542 --> 10:08.125
Now, I think we want
to put eyes in the water.

10:08.208 --> 10:12.375
Get some divers in there
and literally confirm

10:12.500 --> 10:14.750
what we think we see

10:14.875 --> 10:16.958
on our electronic gear.

10:17.042 --> 10:19.000
-Recently certified.
-I'm raising

10:19.167 --> 10:20.833
-my hand.
-BOB K.: Well, there's one pair

10:20.958 --> 10:22.542
-of eyes.
-MARTY: So here's the thing,
big brother.

10:22.708 --> 10:23.917
I want to accompany Bob.

10:24.042 --> 10:26.375
At least, you know,
have a go this time.

10:26.500 --> 10:27.667
-Okay.
-Matty,

10:27.792 --> 10:29.333
-sounds like you're all in.
-(exhales) Yes, sir.

10:29.500 --> 10:30.833
MARTY:
So, unfortunately, I'm gonna

10:31.000 --> 10:32.792
leave you on Oak Island because

10:32.917 --> 10:33.875
-it could take about a week.
-I will hold down the fort.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.167
And I wish you complete success.
I mean,

10:36.292 --> 10:37.500
there's nothing better

10:37.583 --> 10:39.167
than putting a period
at the end of a story.

10:39.333 --> 10:41.208
-Yeah.
-BOB K.: I agree.
-RICK: I would love

10:41.375 --> 10:42.833
that you find that period.

10:42.917 --> 10:45.750
-Okay. Well,
let's go give it a try.
-I love this.

10:45.875 --> 10:49.125
Get me in Lake Michigan.
Let's go.

10:52.917 --> 10:55.333
MARTY: We are
in my old stomping grounds now.

10:55.458 --> 10:56.667
I feel like I'm home.

10:56.750 --> 10:58.083
-This is, like,
your roots, I feel like.
-Yeah.

10:58.208 --> 10:59.542
-This is where I come from.
-You and Rick

10:59.667 --> 11:01.167
grew up in this area,

11:01.250 --> 11:03.958
and so I feel like I'm getting
the full Lagina history

11:04.042 --> 11:06.375
-by being here. Yeah.
-Well, you are,
for whatever that's worth.

11:06.542 --> 11:08.500
NARRATOR:
One week after their meeting

11:08.667 --> 11:10.667
in the war room, Marty Lagina

11:10.750 --> 11:13.167
and Matty Blake
travel to Fairport,

11:13.250 --> 11:16.208
a coastal town
on Michigan's Upper Peninsula.

11:16.375 --> 11:18.250
They'll be joining a team

11:18.375 --> 11:21.083
that's exploring the waters
near Poverty Island

11:21.208 --> 11:22.833
five miles to the south,

11:22.958 --> 11:25.000
searching
for a lost shipment of gold

11:25.125 --> 11:27.292
that was reportedly
thrown overboard

11:27.375 --> 11:30.500
into Lake Michigan in 1863.

11:30.667 --> 11:32.292
Hey, we're almost here.

11:32.375 --> 11:33.875
-There it is.
-MATTY: Oh, I think I see it.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.625
MARTY:
There's the big lake.

11:35.750 --> 11:37.125
I'm back in my old stomping
grounds right here

11:37.208 --> 11:38.625
in the Upper Peninsula
of Michigan,

11:38.708 --> 11:39.750
and we are gonna
have another try

11:39.875 --> 11:41.792
at the Poverty Island treasure.

11:41.875 --> 11:43.917
Last year, we were too wed
to the south side.

11:44.042 --> 11:46.667
We're gonna try the north side
of the island this time.

11:46.750 --> 11:48.833
This, sir, is gonna be fun.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.625
-I can't wait.
-Welcome to Michigan's

11:50.708 --> 11:53.083
-wild and wooly Upper Peninsula.
-(laughs) I love it.

11:53.208 --> 11:54.917
-MARTY: Captain Larry.
-Marty. How are you doing?

11:55.042 --> 11:56.875
-This is my buddy Matty Blake.
-Matty.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
-Nice to meet you. I'm Larry.
-Permission to come aboard?

11:58.167 --> 11:59.667
Absolutely.
Come on aboard, fellas.

11:59.750 --> 12:02.208
NARRATOR: Rounding out
the treasure-hunting team

12:02.333 --> 12:04.125
led by Bob Kreipke

12:04.208 --> 12:07.625
is magnetometer expert
and master diver Doug Gossage,

12:07.708 --> 12:11.833
underwater archaeologist
Rob Westrick

12:11.917 --> 12:13.958
and local expert diver
Luke Clyburn,

12:14.042 --> 12:16.500
who has more than six decades
of experience

12:16.625 --> 12:18.625
in the frigid waters
of Lake Michigan.

12:18.750 --> 12:20.208
Are we gonna find
something today, Bob?

12:20.375 --> 12:23.542
-Oh.
-NARRATOR: Piloting the team's
46-foot search vessel,

12:23.667 --> 12:27.167
the <i>Viking,</i>
is Captain Larry Barbeau.

12:27.292 --> 12:29.667
-MARTY: That's our crew,
then, right?
-MATTY: This is everybody.

12:29.792 --> 12:31.417
-How's the waters, Larry?
-LARRY: It shouldn't be
that bad today.

12:31.542 --> 12:33.167
It's supposed to be pretty calm.
Where we're gonna be at,

12:33.333 --> 12:34.583
we should be protected
by the island,

12:34.708 --> 12:35.833
-so we should be all right.
-MARTY: Okay.

12:35.958 --> 12:37.542
Isn't that what the guy
said that sunk out there?

12:37.667 --> 12:38.583
-(all laugh)
-That's the same thing he said,

12:38.708 --> 12:39.958
-so...
-MARTY: That's what I thought.

12:40.083 --> 12:41.667
-Well, let's get going, then.
-LARRY: Let's do it.

12:41.792 --> 12:43.042
Let's get on the water.
Let's get on the water.

12:43.208 --> 12:45.333
Let's go have some fun
and find something.

12:45.417 --> 12:47.958
MARTY:
Let's bring this old girl
out there. Let's go.

12:48.042 --> 12:51.458
BOB K.: There's no real easy way
to get to Poverty Island,

12:51.542 --> 12:53.042
which is also why

12:53.167 --> 12:56.833
it doesn't attract
hundreds of treasure hunters.

12:56.917 --> 12:58.708
And I'll tell you,
there's a lot of reefs

12:58.833 --> 13:00.083
and shoals out there.

13:00.208 --> 13:02.583
Getting even out
to Poverty Island

13:02.708 --> 13:05.042
is not for the faint of heart.

13:05.167 --> 13:06.833
You got to know
what you're doing.

13:07.833 --> 13:09.333
MARTY:
Okay, so, Bob, we are

13:09.500 --> 13:11.500
somewhat zeroed in this year,
right? Tell me

13:11.625 --> 13:12.833
-about that.
-Yes, yes.

13:12.958 --> 13:14.625
This year, we were able to get

13:14.750 --> 13:16.083
absolute coordinates

13:16.208 --> 13:18.875
that we believe
is the <i>Captain Lawrence,</i>

13:19.042 --> 13:21.833
the ship that the lighthouse
keeper's son witnessed.

13:21.917 --> 13:23.833
We do need

13:23.958 --> 13:26.042
to still do
a little bit of plowing,

13:26.167 --> 13:27.750
you know, with the equipment

13:27.875 --> 13:32.208
-to see exactly,
yep, that is the debris field.
-MARTY: Okay.

13:32.375 --> 13:33.833
Do you think
there's an actual chance

13:33.958 --> 13:35.250
you'll come up
with those chests?

13:35.375 --> 13:38.083
I wouldn't have spent
the decades I have

13:38.208 --> 13:39.833
-fooling around with this...
-I suppose.

13:39.917 --> 13:42.458
-Yeah.
-...if I didn't think
there was a possibility.

13:42.542 --> 13:44.708
But the real thing is

13:44.833 --> 13:46.833
-piecing the history together.
-MARTY: Right.

13:46.917 --> 13:48.000
Because we don't know
the provenance

13:48.125 --> 13:49.375
-of that boat. The first one.
-BOB K.: No.

13:49.500 --> 13:50.667
MARTY:
The one that threw

13:50.750 --> 13:52.333
-the treasure overboard.
-BOB K.: That's right.

13:52.417 --> 13:54.667
And suppose
we actually found this stuff.

13:54.792 --> 13:56.500
What we could unravel
is who is trying

13:56.625 --> 13:58.708
to mess with the U.S. Civil War

13:58.833 --> 14:00.833
-down through Michigan.
-Yes.

14:00.958 --> 14:03.000
-Yes. Yes.
-What a piece of history
that would be.

14:03.125 --> 14:04.708
What's your job gonna be
here today, then, Luke?

14:04.875 --> 14:06.667
My job is actually
to go underwater and look

14:06.750 --> 14:09.500
-at the debris field.
-How would you identify
the <i>Captain Lawrence?</i>

14:09.583 --> 14:12.333
Underwater, I'm gonna look
for anything that's a ship part.

14:12.417 --> 14:16.000
I've been doing a lot of work
in Michigan

14:16.125 --> 14:18.833
documenting historic shipwrecks.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.375
Lot of these ships were built...

14:20.500 --> 14:22.875
Most of them have plans
that you can go back in

14:23.000 --> 14:24.250
-and look
at the history of them.
-Sure.

14:24.375 --> 14:26.667
And you can say
without any question

14:26.750 --> 14:29.333
this was a particular boat
or it was not.

14:29.458 --> 14:31.875
You got coordinates
that get us in the general area.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.500
You're gonna refine it.

14:33.625 --> 14:37.625
Yeah. So, we-we laid out
about five or six survey lanes.

14:37.708 --> 14:41.000
NARRATOR:
Captain Larry Barbeau
will pilot the <i>Viking</i>

14:41.125 --> 14:44.167
along the survey lanes
in a precise grid pattern.

14:44.292 --> 14:46.708
Underwater imaging expert
Doug Gossage

14:46.833 --> 14:50.792
will then use his magnetometer
to identify ferrous targets,

14:50.917 --> 14:53.833
such as an anchor,
boiler or propeller--

14:54.000 --> 14:56.125
items that could help locate

14:56.208 --> 14:59.375
the debris field
of the <i>Captain Lawrence.</i>

14:59.542 --> 15:03.625
What I'm expecting here,
since the record shows that it's

15:03.750 --> 15:05.167
broken up on rocks,

15:05.333 --> 15:07.917
is not so much
an intact, you know, hull

15:08.042 --> 15:12.375
-as, uh, a scattering of iron.
-MARTY: Oh, yeah.
-MATTY: A spread.

15:12.542 --> 15:14.417
LARRY:
Hey, we're coming up
to Poverty right now.

15:14.542 --> 15:17.500
Hey, guys. There she be.

15:17.625 --> 15:21.000
-MATTY: Oh, wow, that's it? Wow.
-MARTY: Poverty Island.

15:22.167 --> 15:25.500
It's really creepy.
That island looks haunted.

15:26.708 --> 15:28.042
You know,
it kind of sets the stage

15:28.167 --> 15:30.500
that we are in a mysterious

15:30.667 --> 15:32.667
and perhaps dangerous spot.

15:32.750 --> 15:36.625
-You know, it's chilling.
It looks like a haunted house.
-Doesn't it?

15:36.708 --> 15:38.667
But what's giving me
the chills now

15:38.792 --> 15:40.333
is-is thinking
of what it was like.

15:40.417 --> 15:43.208
I mean, these families
living out here. So isolated.

15:43.333 --> 15:45.167
Imagining what it would be like
on a stormy night...

15:45.250 --> 15:46.583
It's just incredible
what they went through.

15:46.708 --> 15:47.917
MARTY:
Yeah.

15:48.042 --> 15:50.208
Captain Larry,
I think we're all set here.

15:50.333 --> 15:51.958
-Let's go to our...
Let's go to our destination.
-LARRY: All set?

15:52.042 --> 15:53.458
-All right, sounds good.
-MARTY: Let's get that fish

15:53.583 --> 15:56.042
-in the water. All right.
Thank you.
-LARRY: Sounds great.

15:56.208 --> 15:57.500
It's a big lake,
and other people

15:57.667 --> 15:59.167
have looked, right?

15:59.292 --> 16:02.208
But we're bringing tools
that other people haven't used.

16:02.333 --> 16:04.125
We're bringing
a really good team.

16:04.208 --> 16:06.458
LARRY:
Uh, we're at the waypoint
if you want to go ahead and drop

16:06.583 --> 16:08.000
-the magnetometer in.
I'll get on track.
-DOUG G.: Yeah, go ahead

16:08.167 --> 16:09.292
and get on track,
and we'll drop it in.

16:09.417 --> 16:11.250
I think we have
a much better chance of finding

16:11.375 --> 16:14.000
the remnants
of the <i>Captain Lawrence,</i>

16:14.125 --> 16:16.333
which might eventually lead us
to the gold.

16:16.458 --> 16:18.333
DOUG G.:
Okay, yeah, so,
we're close to the area here.

16:18.417 --> 16:19.917
-Let's get in.
-MATTY: Okay, all right.

16:21.833 --> 16:24.333
DOUG G.:
What we're expecting or hoping
to see when we're running

16:24.417 --> 16:26.208
the magnetometer survey
is some variation

16:26.375 --> 16:28.292
in the Earth's magnetic field.

16:28.375 --> 16:31.792
And if we are lucky enough
to run over the center

16:31.875 --> 16:34.000
of a larger item
like an air compressor

16:34.125 --> 16:36.292
or an engine,
that'll be a spike.

16:36.375 --> 16:39.458
-Even an untrained eye like us,
we could see that spike?
-DOUG G.: Yeah.

16:39.542 --> 16:41.500
-MATTY: Great.
-You can see that spike.
And if I dropped a buoy on that,

16:41.625 --> 16:43.333
-it's within six feet,
I promise you.
-Got it.

16:43.417 --> 16:45.208
Got it.

16:45.375 --> 16:48.833
The magnetometer is only going
to find ferrous material,

16:49.000 --> 16:50.333
but even a wooden ship has a lot

16:50.458 --> 16:52.958
of iron in it,
and this ship we're looking for

16:53.042 --> 16:55.958
had big boilers,
had air compressors on it.

16:56.042 --> 16:58.458
How is he tracking? How is he...
Does he have GPS

16:58.542 --> 17:01.333
-up there or something?
-DOUG G.: I gave him,
uh, the start lane

17:01.458 --> 17:02.500
and the end lane
GPS coordinates,

17:02.625 --> 17:05.042
and he entered them in
as waypoints.

17:05.167 --> 17:06.917
Waypoints. So he's gonna go
to the next waypoint.

17:07.042 --> 17:08.375
-DOUG G.: Yeah. Yeah. So when...
-MARTY: I see.

17:08.542 --> 17:10.208
-Each of the red dots
is a waypoint?
-DOUG G.: Right.

17:10.333 --> 17:12.167
-MARTY: Okay.
-MATTY: This is
interesting right now

17:12.250 --> 17:14.833
watching Doug with his tech,

17:14.917 --> 17:16.708
right? Larry has to hit

17:16.833 --> 17:18.208
the right precise spots.

17:18.375 --> 17:19.875
Zoom it in.
I'll be able to get that line.

17:20.042 --> 17:21.417
I'll be able to run right on it.

17:21.542 --> 17:23.667
MATTY:
If Larry's missing that
or if he's off

17:23.792 --> 17:25.833
his coordinates,
it throws the whole read off.

17:25.958 --> 17:28.333
Modern technology is awesome,

17:28.500 --> 17:30.042
but if you don't have
a good old captain

17:30.208 --> 17:31.250
that knows
how to drive this thing,

17:31.375 --> 17:33.667
might as well not even bother.

17:33.750 --> 17:36.000
DOUG G.:
So, what it'll do instead
of this straight line here

17:36.083 --> 17:38.125
is it'll come
across the screen that way,

17:38.208 --> 17:39.917
and it might come back
to where it started.

17:40.042 --> 17:43.333
-That would mean we're
directly over the top of it.
-MATTY: Okay.

17:43.458 --> 17:44.833
-Now wait a minute,
now wait a minute.
-MATTY: Whoa!

17:44.917 --> 17:46.083
-Wait a second.
-See that dip?

17:46.208 --> 17:47.625
Now we got a good hit.

17:47.708 --> 17:50.667
MATTY:
This is quite simple.
As that line moves

17:50.792 --> 17:54.000
on his little right column
of the screen, that's a hit.

17:54.125 --> 17:56.333
That's something anomalous.
That is

17:56.500 --> 17:58.167
ferrous metal.

17:58.250 --> 18:01.458
And what we have to find out now
is is that consistent?

18:01.583 --> 18:04.333
-So, this line went
from here to there?
-DOUG G.: Yeah. So it went

18:04.458 --> 18:06.417
-that side from center line,
then went off there.
-MATTY: Wow!

18:06.542 --> 18:08.167
-What does that mean,
that it's...?
-And now it's returning.

18:08.250 --> 18:10.500
-It's like a huge curve.
-A big arc.

18:10.583 --> 18:12.333
So, this is unbelievable.
So, so, right now,

18:12.458 --> 18:14.875
that line indicates we could be
on top of a debris field

18:15.042 --> 18:17.625
-that's lasting that long?
-DOUG G.: We actually
would be coming out of it

18:17.750 --> 18:19.625
-right now because it's
returning back, too.
-MARTY: Hauling back.

18:19.750 --> 18:21.292
-MATTY: Oh, I see it, yeah.
It's coming back.
-DOUG G.: Yeah.

18:21.375 --> 18:23.375
-This is good.
-MATTY: This is awesome.

18:23.542 --> 18:24.667
So, would you pick that
as a dive spot?

18:24.792 --> 18:27.167
Uh, let's run
a couple more parallel lines,

18:27.333 --> 18:29.417
and if it matches up with the
scenery that we're seeing here,

18:29.542 --> 18:31.333
I would take that, absolutely.

18:32.375 --> 18:34.167
MATTY:
So, we're gonna drive back

18:34.250 --> 18:36.000
the other way
and see if that matches.

18:36.125 --> 18:39.167
That was a beautiful turn.
Good job, Larry.

18:39.292 --> 18:42.167
-MATTY: Larry's
nailing the turns.
-Textbook lane.

18:42.250 --> 18:44.292
-MATTY: It's starting to bend.
-DOUG G.: A little bit.

18:44.417 --> 18:46.458
-It's inching over.
-There it goes.

18:46.542 --> 18:48.792
We are seeing these spikes,
and-and they're

18:48.917 --> 18:50.375
now repeatable.

18:50.500 --> 18:52.167
-It's bending. Look at that.
-I think so.

18:52.250 --> 18:54.125
-Right at the outcropping.
-Yeah.

18:54.208 --> 18:55.833
MATTY:
That's incredible.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.208
And they seem to be
in the same area,

18:58.333 --> 18:59.875
so I can tell we're all

19:00.042 --> 19:01.375
starting to think, like,
we could have found

19:01.500 --> 19:03.167
the debris field
of the <i>Captain Lawrence.</i>

19:03.292 --> 19:05.208
Yeah, we just need
one more hit here,

19:05.333 --> 19:08.333
and then we'll virtually know.

19:08.500 --> 19:10.542
DOUG G.:
We're literally right offshore,
right in the spot

19:10.667 --> 19:12.833
-where we expect it to be.
-Right in the spot. Come on.

19:12.917 --> 19:14.708
It's kind of
like one of those...

19:14.833 --> 19:16.958
Mm, maybe pre-bingo moments.

19:17.083 --> 19:18.333
I'm about to say "bingo,"

19:18.458 --> 19:20.333
but I'm not quite there.
But we're close.

19:20.458 --> 19:23.000
I think we've got it
right off that shoal.

19:23.083 --> 19:25.083
Rob, ready to bring the fish in?

19:25.208 --> 19:27.792
The magnetometer scan went well
from most standpoints.

19:27.875 --> 19:29.542
The device worked.

19:29.708 --> 19:32.000
-MATTY: Got it?
-MARTY: We're confident
in the data. And yes,

19:32.125 --> 19:34.167
-we got hits.
-MATTY: Nice.

19:34.250 --> 19:37.083
You need to go back,
back on shore,

19:37.208 --> 19:39.292
crunch this data
and pick the best spot.

19:39.375 --> 19:41.375
-Is that the idea?
-Yeah. Ideally,

19:41.500 --> 19:45.958
I can correct imperfections
in the GPS and then the data.

19:46.042 --> 19:47.875
And, uh, it takes
a little bit of time.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.167
Do you think there's enough
for us to do a dive tomorrow?

19:50.292 --> 19:53.042
DOUG G.:
I'm encouraged
with, uh, what we saw.

19:53.208 --> 19:55.000
I don't think
we hit one large item.

19:55.083 --> 19:56.667
I think we hit a debris field.

19:56.750 --> 19:59.208
I'd put it in the 90th
percentile that we're gonna have

19:59.375 --> 20:01.042
a good place to dive,
but Doug wants to go home.

20:01.167 --> 20:02.250
He wants to crunch the numbers.

20:02.375 --> 20:04.792
He wants to get us
the optimum place to dive.

20:04.875 --> 20:06.292
And tomorrow, we're diving.

20:06.375 --> 20:08.792
-Skipper, bring us home.
-You got it.
-Great job, Captain.

20:08.875 --> 20:10.500
MARTY:
Good job. You must have been
good at coloring

20:10.625 --> 20:12.500
when you were little because
you stayed right in the lines.

20:12.625 --> 20:14.583
LARRY:
Stayed in the lines.

20:18.833 --> 20:20.000
MARTY: Matty, you know
I hate to be cliché, buddy,

20:20.083 --> 20:21.458
but today's the day.

20:21.542 --> 20:23.167
Well, today's the day
we're gonna get in that water,

20:23.250 --> 20:24.667
-I hope, at least.
-I hope.

20:24.792 --> 20:27.167
I hope he's got, like,
a, you know, a grade A target.

20:27.333 --> 20:28.667
-Right.
-Because diving

20:28.792 --> 20:31.792
here today is the equivalent
of, "It's time to dig,"

20:31.875 --> 20:33.667
-right? "It's time to dive."
-MATTY: Exactly. Exactly.

20:33.792 --> 20:36.292
NARRATOR:
In Fairport, Michigan,
Marty Lagina

20:36.417 --> 20:39.458
and Matty Blake
are assisting a team

20:39.542 --> 20:42.333
that's searching
for lost Civil War gold believed

20:42.458 --> 20:44.667
to be on the bottom
of Lake Michigan.

20:44.750 --> 20:46.250
-Hey, Matty. Hey, Marty.
-MARTY: There they are.

20:46.375 --> 20:48.542
-Hey, Doug. Hey, Bob.
-How you guys doing?

20:48.708 --> 20:50.375
NARRATOR: Image scanning
specialist Doug Gossage

20:50.500 --> 20:53.625
and team leader Bob Kreipke
have been analyzing

20:53.708 --> 20:56.292
the data from yesterday's
magnetometer scans

20:56.417 --> 20:59.458
to identify
the most promising targets.

20:59.583 --> 21:02.667
The team hopes that the hits
discovered just north

21:02.792 --> 21:04.417
of Poverty Island

21:04.542 --> 21:07.500
are part of a debris field
that will lead to the wreckage

21:07.583 --> 21:09.333
of the <i>Captain Lawrence</i>
and millions

21:09.500 --> 21:11.417
in lost Civil War gold.

21:11.542 --> 21:12.833
BOB K.:
I think we got some good news.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.375
Well, we want a place to dive,

21:14.500 --> 21:16.250
-and we want
a damn good place to dive.
-Okay.

21:16.375 --> 21:17.833
-We'll give you a good place.
-All right.

21:17.958 --> 21:19.167
So, what we have here,

21:19.250 --> 21:21.375
this is
the, uh, bird's-eye view.

21:21.500 --> 21:23.333
We have Poverty Island here.

21:23.458 --> 21:24.958
-So, we ran five lines
if you remember.
-MARTY: Sure.

21:25.042 --> 21:26.250
-Yep.
-Yeah, absolutely.

21:26.375 --> 21:29.042
One in particular, uh,
it had some...

21:29.208 --> 21:30.583
well, let's just say
some business on it.

21:30.708 --> 21:32.375
-Yes, yes.
-MARTY: Okay. It only takes one,

21:32.542 --> 21:33.792
-right?
-That's right.

21:33.875 --> 21:36.000
And this is the line.

21:36.125 --> 21:37.875
So, what we have
is the left side

21:38.042 --> 21:39.333
is the beginning of that lane,

21:39.458 --> 21:41.875
and the right side
is the end of that lane.

21:42.042 --> 21:43.500
So, this here could very well

21:43.625 --> 21:46.667
potentially be a debris field.

21:46.792 --> 21:48.458
-You got
the Grand Tetons over here.
-DOUG G.: Yeah,

21:48.542 --> 21:50.542
there's a couple... There's
a couple of good spikes there.

21:50.667 --> 21:53.500
You know, obviously,
I think that is our best spot.

21:53.625 --> 21:55.333
Does that correspond
with where we saw the line

21:55.500 --> 21:57.667
tracking almost off the screen
in that area?

21:57.750 --> 21:59.333
DOUG G.:
Yeah, I think it does.

21:59.417 --> 22:00.625
That's our dive spot, then.

22:00.708 --> 22:03.917
I know exactly what I would like
to find down there,

22:04.042 --> 22:07.083
but-but why don't you tell me,
what are we likely

22:07.208 --> 22:08.458
to find, Doug? I mean...

22:08.583 --> 22:10.333
Well, based on this signature,

22:10.417 --> 22:13.667
here I would expect
that maybe planking

22:13.792 --> 22:16.708
-and maybe some pins,
that sort of thing.
-Okay.

22:16.833 --> 22:19.208
DOUG G.:
Now, when we get to that end
and those Grand Tetons,

22:19.333 --> 22:20.750
as you explain them,

22:20.875 --> 22:24.208
um, that's gonna be
a little bit, uh, more exciting.

22:24.375 --> 22:25.583
That could be
one of the air compressors

22:25.708 --> 22:27.708
-that was on there.
-Um, potentially. It could be.

22:27.833 --> 22:30.250
Yeah, it is... It's something
definitely more substantial

22:30.375 --> 22:32.333
-than scattered debris.
-MARTY: We got

22:32.500 --> 22:34.125
everything we need
to justify a dive.

22:34.208 --> 22:36.125
What was it,
.45 billion reasons?

22:36.208 --> 22:37.667
MARTY:
That's right.
That's what we came here for.

22:37.792 --> 22:39.042
-All right, cool.
-Right, Bob?

22:39.208 --> 22:40.542
Oh, that's why we're here.

22:40.667 --> 22:42.042
MARTY:
(laughs) All right.

22:42.208 --> 22:43.333
Time to dive. Let's go.

22:43.458 --> 22:45.333
-Let's go dive.
-Okay.

22:49.250 --> 22:50.875
-Hello, my friends.
-How are you?

22:51.042 --> 22:52.375
Good. Thank you, sir.

22:52.542 --> 22:54.833
-Permission
to come aboard again?
-You bet.

22:54.958 --> 22:56.208
It's time to go. You know,

22:56.375 --> 22:57.583
I often say on Oak Island,

22:57.708 --> 22:59.583
"It's time to dig."
Here, it's time

22:59.708 --> 23:02.208
to dive, time to search.
It's always exciting.

23:02.333 --> 23:04.208
-Here we go.
-MATTY: When you think
about the numbers

23:04.375 --> 23:06.333
of the potential of this gold,

23:06.417 --> 23:08.708
$400 million
in today's currency,

23:08.833 --> 23:10.708
that is literally breathtaking.

23:10.833 --> 23:12.292
You have
to kind of calm yourself

23:12.417 --> 23:13.333
and look at the evidence.
But, you know,

23:13.500 --> 23:14.750
Bob's done that, so I trust

23:14.875 --> 23:17.500
his enthusiasm,
and I trust Marty's instincts.

23:17.625 --> 23:19.917
Looks like we're getting pretty
close to the dive spot, right?

23:20.042 --> 23:22.792
Yeah. The three of us, Luke, you
and I are gonna be in the water.

23:22.875 --> 23:24.500
So, Marty's gonna be
on the surface comm.

23:24.667 --> 23:26.667
He'll be able to talk to us,

23:26.792 --> 23:28.500
-and we'll be able
to respond to him.
-Great.

23:28.667 --> 23:29.917
And then I'm gonna have

23:30.042 --> 23:32.750
a video camera,
and it's got an umbilical cord

23:32.875 --> 23:34.000
up to the boat.

23:34.125 --> 23:35.667
And Marty will be able to see...

23:35.792 --> 23:37.500
-MARTY: What you're seeing.
-...what I'm pointing at.

23:37.625 --> 23:39.000
-Oh, fantastic.
-Yeah.

23:39.125 --> 23:40.417
NARRATOR:
Diver Luke Clyburn

23:40.542 --> 23:42.000
will also be deploying

23:42.167 --> 23:46.292
the JW Fishers Pulse 8X
underwater metal detector,

23:46.375 --> 23:48.500
capable of scanning
for ferrous targets

23:48.583 --> 23:51.250
at depths of up to 200 feet.

23:51.375 --> 23:53.500
Luke will scan any debris

23:53.625 --> 23:56.333
to try to determine
whether it's a ship's part

23:56.417 --> 23:59.917
that could have belonged
to the <i>Captain Lawrence.</i>

24:00.042 --> 24:01.875
All right, we're here.
We're gonna throw the anchor in.

24:02.000 --> 24:03.583
We'll have Noel throw
the anchor in. Get us situated.

24:03.708 --> 24:05.500
And you guys can get in
the water and see what you find.

24:05.583 --> 24:07.167
All right, guys, suit up.
Let's go.

24:07.292 --> 24:08.458
-We're gonna try this.
-LUKE: Great.

24:08.542 --> 24:10.667
MATTY:
Once again,

24:10.792 --> 24:14.333
we have a dream team assembled
for a mystery like this

24:14.458 --> 24:15.875
and specifically this one.
I mean,

24:16.042 --> 24:18.792
Doug Gossage
is incredible at what he does,

24:18.875 --> 24:20.458
using that magnetometer
to get scans.

24:20.583 --> 24:23.208
Also has a wealth
of diving experience,

24:23.333 --> 24:25.000
so he's perfect for the job.

24:25.125 --> 24:26.708
And, uh, Luke Clyburn, who's got

24:26.875 --> 24:30.000
literally thousands of hours
with dives

24:30.083 --> 24:31.958
in Lake Michigan
and the Great Lakes.

24:32.083 --> 24:34.583
So, I couldn't be diving
with two better people.

24:34.708 --> 24:38.000
Okay, guys, everybody okay?
Okay? Okay? Okay?

24:38.125 --> 24:39.917
You got this, bud.

24:42.375 --> 24:44.042
We've done
all the equipment checks.

24:44.167 --> 24:45.417
We've gone over my gear.

24:45.542 --> 24:47.125
This is it. It's go time.

24:47.208 --> 24:48.500
In a sense,

24:48.583 --> 24:49.875
you're trying to find a needle
in a haystack,

24:50.042 --> 24:52.833
especially underwater,
so I'm excited

24:52.958 --> 24:54.375
-to see what we come up with.
-MARTY: Can you hear me,

24:54.542 --> 24:55.708
Matty?

24:58.250 --> 24:59.583
10-4.

25:10.958 --> 25:12.750
I feel, like, sort of
like a mother bear up here

25:12.875 --> 25:14.042
-or something, you know?
-(laughs)

25:14.167 --> 25:16.958
Some of my cubs
just went in the water.

25:28.792 --> 25:32.500
-BOB K.: Well, it looks pretty
flat here, doesn't it, Marty?
-MARTY: Yeah.

25:32.625 --> 25:34.708
This brings you back
to sobering reality, doesn't it?

25:34.875 --> 25:37.958
I mean this looks like stuff
that could cover up anything.

25:38.042 --> 25:39.833
-BOB K.: Yes. Yeah.
-MARTY: Yeah.

25:39.958 --> 25:41.750
Could be something
one inch below that.

25:41.875 --> 25:44.042
-Oh, absolutely. Yeah.
-And we're not seeing it.

25:45.250 --> 25:47.375
-BOB K.: Yeah.
-MARTY: Those guys
got their work

25:47.500 --> 25:49.625
-cut out for them down there.
-Yeah.

26:02.583 --> 26:04.542
Oh, yeah.

26:14.792 --> 26:17.750
Doug, do you think you're...
we're in the right spot?

26:21.042 --> 26:22.833
We think that's a good idea.
Heading out...

26:22.917 --> 26:25.958
out from the boat.
Head deeper. Over.

26:40.208 --> 26:43.833
We start making our way back
up that ledge from 50 feet up,

26:43.958 --> 26:45.833
and I see something,
and I point to it.

26:47.708 --> 26:49.333
What's that? What's that?

26:49.458 --> 26:51.708
Well, it's something,
it looks like.

26:54.667 --> 26:55.958
Here we go.

26:59.167 --> 27:00.917
It looks like a deadeye.

27:01.042 --> 27:03.917
They used deadeyes
on ships a lot,

27:04.042 --> 27:06.458
and they were
a round cylinder of wood

27:06.542 --> 27:10.583
with holes in them, which is
why they were called deadeyes.

27:10.708 --> 27:13.000
And you'd run the cabling
through those.

27:34.167 --> 27:36.875
NARRATOR: Just north of Poverty
Island in Lake Michigan...

27:39.667 --> 27:41.458
Does it have a name
carved in it?

27:41.542 --> 27:44.000
NARRATOR:
...Marty Lagina and Matty Blake

27:44.083 --> 27:46.417
are providing help
to a treasure-hunting team

27:46.542 --> 27:48.667
searching for a shipwreck.

27:48.792 --> 27:51.542
One that sank in 1933,

27:51.667 --> 27:55.125
reportedly
just after it salvaged millions

27:55.208 --> 27:56.583
in Civil War gold.

27:56.708 --> 27:58.458
Matty and the other divers

27:58.583 --> 28:01.000
have just discovered
man-made objects

28:01.083 --> 28:03.542
that they hope are part
of a debris field

28:03.708 --> 28:05.500
that will lead them
to the lost vessel

28:05.625 --> 28:08.000
and its treasure.

28:08.125 --> 28:11.583
They can't bring it up,
though, can they?

28:11.708 --> 28:13.583
BOB K.:
The state of Michigan

28:13.708 --> 28:17.167
happens to have
some very strict rules.

28:17.292 --> 28:20.625
You can document things
that you find on the bottom.

28:20.708 --> 28:24.500
You can come back
and make some claims to them.

28:24.625 --> 28:27.083
You can see what it is there,

28:27.208 --> 28:30.708
especially when you're
rubbing away zebra mussels,

28:30.875 --> 28:32.958
but the state of Michigan
does not want you

28:33.083 --> 28:34.500
to bring it to the surface,

28:34.625 --> 28:36.292
even to verify it.

28:43.750 --> 28:45.458
Roger.

28:46.667 --> 28:48.833
We want to keep expanding
the search,

28:48.917 --> 28:50.875
but if something goes wrong
on coming up,

28:51.042 --> 28:52.500
you have to have
a little extra air.

28:52.583 --> 28:55.125
Kind of like an airplane
landing with sufficient fuel,

28:55.208 --> 28:57.167
you know,
to be able to take off again.

28:57.333 --> 28:58.500
It's kind of like that.

28:58.625 --> 29:00.125
So, when it gets
to a certain pressure,

29:00.208 --> 29:02.875
the rules are the dive's over.
Divers are coming up.

29:03.000 --> 29:04.667
Yeah, you got something.

29:04.792 --> 29:06.333
(chuckles)

29:06.417 --> 29:08.833
-A piece of it.
-Definitely shipwreck, yeah.

29:08.917 --> 29:11.292
We started out
and kind of went a little, uh...

29:11.375 --> 29:12.667
right towards the shore

29:12.792 --> 29:14.083
and down there
in a little deeper water.

29:14.208 --> 29:16.625
I think it was maybe 50 feet.
And, uh,

29:16.708 --> 29:19.875
I think we all saw it
all at the same time,

29:20.000 --> 29:21.083
and everybody
just kind of converged on it.

29:21.208 --> 29:22.667
MARTY:
Yeah, we saw it, too,

29:22.792 --> 29:23.958
-but we couldn't tell
what it was.
-Yeah, no,

29:24.042 --> 29:25.792
-it's shipwreck material.
It's...
-Yes!

29:25.875 --> 29:27.167
DOUG G.:
Oh, yeah.

29:27.250 --> 29:29.167
It's...

29:29.250 --> 29:30.667
Yeah.

29:30.792 --> 29:32.208
I-It's like a round, um,

29:32.375 --> 29:35.167
-you know,
about telephone size, pole size.
-Yep.

29:35.292 --> 29:37.500
-And it was a corner post
of some sort.
-That big?

29:37.625 --> 29:41.375
-Oh, yeah, it was, uh,
it was this high off the bottom.
-Oh.

29:41.500 --> 29:44.667
And that metal rod
was probably all of two feet,

29:44.833 --> 29:45.875
-two and a half feet.
-MATTY: Yeah.

29:46.042 --> 29:47.292
And it was... it was definitely,

29:47.375 --> 29:49.125
you know,
the kind of rod that they used

29:49.208 --> 29:50.500
-in shipwrecks.
-MARTY: That's great.
-MATTY: Back then?

29:50.667 --> 29:52.167
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I've seen it lots.

29:52.250 --> 29:55.875
This artifact is part
of a ship that broke off

29:56.000 --> 29:58.167
in a pretty disastrous method

29:58.292 --> 30:00.958
because it's not
a complete artifact.

30:01.083 --> 30:03.833
It's just a-a small piece of it.

30:03.958 --> 30:06.000
So, it's consistent
with what we're looking for.

30:06.125 --> 30:07.417
So, where do we go from here?

30:11.958 --> 30:13.875
Okay. Well, let's get you
new tanks. Let's go.

30:14.042 --> 30:15.792
-MATTY: Great.
-Let's get you back
in the water.

30:20.875 --> 30:22.667
All right, here we go.

30:22.750 --> 30:24.417
Here we go again.

30:24.542 --> 30:26.500
MARTY:
We got one thing found.

30:26.583 --> 30:29.083
Great.
We-We're not skunked. Yay!

30:29.208 --> 30:31.208
But we need to find
some more stuff.

30:31.333 --> 30:32.625
We need a pointer.

30:32.708 --> 30:34.667
You have to start finding
that debris trail.

30:34.792 --> 30:36.333
Divers down.

30:40.875 --> 30:43.208
What are you seeing, Doug?
Anything we need to know?

30:47.375 --> 30:50.250
-Yeah, the sediment looks...
It does.
-MARTY: It looks firm.

30:50.375 --> 30:51.708
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but that would indicate

30:51.875 --> 30:53.458
that stuff should be
on the surface.

30:53.542 --> 30:55.333
Stuff should be.
Yeah, absolutely.

31:10.833 --> 31:12.833
Tree branch.

31:17.208 --> 31:19.583
MARTY:
Topside to Doug for air check.

31:19.708 --> 31:21.250
How much you got?

31:23.542 --> 31:25.125
Roger that.

31:26.125 --> 31:27.542
They still got
a little bit of time.

31:27.667 --> 31:29.250
Might find something yet.

31:30.833 --> 31:32.750
What we know about that ship,

31:32.875 --> 31:34.292
there's got to be
stuff down there.

31:34.375 --> 31:37.417
We-we might just be
not quite in the right area.

31:37.542 --> 31:40.167
-And the thing is if you miss it
by just a little bit...
-Yeah.

31:40.250 --> 31:43.500
-You miss by an inch,
you miss by a mile.
-ROB W.: Exactly.

31:56.083 --> 31:58.292
(detector whines)

32:02.167 --> 32:04.000
Wow.

32:04.125 --> 32:06.500
Hey Doug,
can you, uh, look at the timber

32:06.625 --> 32:08.542
and give me the dimensions?

32:14.875 --> 32:16.542
Standing by.

32:22.250 --> 32:25.542
Okay. You don't use
two-inch-thick wood for much.

32:36.708 --> 32:38.583
Sound like a ship piece to you?

32:38.708 --> 32:40.500
It does. Timber that long,

32:40.583 --> 32:43.167
that's a... that's a piece
of hull structure.

32:43.292 --> 32:45.500
-Has to be, right?
-It has to be.
It can't be anything else.

32:45.625 --> 32:49.250
MATTY:
We are in an area
that was an area of interest.

32:49.375 --> 32:52.292
We are diving based on data.

32:52.417 --> 32:55.083
This could be something
from the <i>Captain Lawrence.</i>

32:55.208 --> 32:57.542
That ship might have been
right above the gold

32:57.708 --> 33:00.083
or had the gold on board.

33:00.208 --> 33:02.833
So we might be real close.

33:02.917 --> 33:04.333
This is good news.

33:11.875 --> 33:13.042
NARRATOR:
Off the coast of Poverty Island

33:13.208 --> 33:14.958
in Lake Michigan...

33:16.917 --> 33:18.750
MARTY:
That's fantastic.

33:18.875 --> 33:22.333
NARRATOR: ...Marty Lagina,
Matty Blake and their team

33:22.417 --> 33:24.667
have found evidence
of a possible shipwreck

33:24.792 --> 33:26.542
connected to a fortune

33:26.667 --> 33:28.500
in lost Civil War gold.

33:30.375 --> 33:33.167
Matty Blake
is part of the dive team

33:33.292 --> 33:36.833
that's investigating
the underwater finds.

33:36.958 --> 33:38.542
Probably is an outer frame,

33:38.708 --> 33:40.292
would've wrapped
around the ship.

33:40.417 --> 33:42.792
Then it'd be
about the right age, too, then,

33:42.875 --> 33:44.625
-wouldn't it?
-It would be.

33:44.708 --> 33:48.042
Has it got any sort
of fasteners or anything in it?

33:48.167 --> 33:51.292
Doug, any-any evidence
of fasteners of some type

33:51.375 --> 33:52.750
or holes?

33:58.417 --> 34:02.417
ROB W.:
If we were to figure how
far spaced are the fasteners,

34:02.542 --> 34:03.417
you know, based on that,

34:03.542 --> 34:05.458
you know how far away
those ribs were,

34:05.542 --> 34:06.708
and you can determine

34:06.833 --> 34:08.917
a rough guess to how long
the vessel would have been.

34:09.042 --> 34:11.292
And if it matches up
with the <i>Captain Lawrence,</i>

34:11.417 --> 34:13.542
it's another piece
of the puzzle.

34:29.667 --> 34:32.708
-They stirred up the bottom.
-They must be stirring up
the bottom, yeah.

34:53.375 --> 34:55.458
Okay. Surface as you need to.

35:02.542 --> 35:05.417
That's great, guys. Well done.

35:05.542 --> 35:07.833
I think it's
the <i>Captain Lawrence.</i> I'm gonna

35:07.958 --> 35:09.125
-choose to believe it.
-Yeah.

35:09.250 --> 35:11.292
So, where are the chests, Bob?

35:11.375 --> 35:15.208
If it drifted this way,
it's back there.

35:15.333 --> 35:18.333
You're finding a piece,
you got a starting point,

35:18.500 --> 35:20.458
-and from there...
-MARTY: Well,
we have two points now,

35:20.542 --> 35:22.500
so when we plot those
when we get up,

35:22.667 --> 35:24.708
that could be
really interesting.

35:24.833 --> 35:27.333
-BOB K.: Sure.
-MARTY: I don't know
of anybody underwater

35:27.458 --> 35:29.542
that ever sort of just went in

35:29.667 --> 35:32.708
and dove and found something,
like, you know, in five minutes.

35:32.875 --> 35:34.458
We'd have to hire
a team of divers

35:34.583 --> 35:36.375
and search
this whole bloody channel.

35:37.375 --> 35:39.167
BOB K.:
We had always speculated

35:39.292 --> 35:41.042
that we would not find

35:41.167 --> 35:44.250
a pristine, intact ship
on the bottom there.

35:44.375 --> 35:46.000
The Coast Guard reports

35:46.125 --> 35:48.917
say the ship
got smashed into pieces.

35:49.042 --> 35:51.042
So we were suspecting

35:51.167 --> 35:54.042
it would be a "debris field."

35:54.167 --> 35:58.875
And that debris field
could stretch a ways.

35:59.000 --> 36:00.167
I think that was
an excellent dive.

36:00.333 --> 36:01.792
MARTY:
We're running out of daylight.

36:01.875 --> 36:03.917
These guys are tired and
they're cold. We're calling it.

36:04.042 --> 36:05.792
But we moved the dial.
We're on the boat.

36:05.875 --> 36:07.250
We're happy. We're safe.

36:07.375 --> 36:09.333
If I had to ask you
for a percentage,

36:09.500 --> 36:11.000
was that a piece
of a wooden ship, what is it?

36:11.167 --> 36:13.208
100%! I like that number.

36:13.375 --> 36:14.750
That's a good number.

36:14.875 --> 36:16.333
Well, here's what occurs to me.

36:16.500 --> 36:17.958
We did a hell of a lot better
than last year.

36:18.042 --> 36:19.333
I mean, last year,
we were kind of

36:19.458 --> 36:20.417
find the needle in the haystack.

36:20.542 --> 36:22.167
Here, we brought
a lot more together.

36:22.250 --> 36:24.125
We had coordinates.
We had you guys.

36:24.208 --> 36:25.667
And we did a lot better.

36:25.792 --> 36:28.125
But, you know, the scary bit
is that this is like a...

36:28.208 --> 36:30.250
This is, like,
just keeps sucking you in.

36:30.375 --> 36:32.583
If you were on this quest alone,

36:32.708 --> 36:34.292
-let's say it was your deal...
-Yes.

36:34.375 --> 36:35.458
Would you keep coming back now?

36:35.542 --> 36:36.667
You seen enough
to have you come back?

36:36.792 --> 36:39.333
Yeah, I would.
It's intrigued me enough now,

36:39.458 --> 36:41.792
uh, I-I want to find this ship.

36:41.917 --> 36:43.333
MARTY:
That's great, guys.

36:43.417 --> 36:44.792
Well done. You're probably cold.

36:44.875 --> 36:46.667
-Freezing but exhilarated.
-MARTY: Yeah, let's...

36:46.792 --> 36:48.333
let's get this boat to shore
and see if we can get you

36:48.458 --> 36:50.667
-a cup of hot coffee.
-(laughs)

36:54.708 --> 36:56.417
DOUG G.:
I think <i>Captain Lawrence</i>

36:56.542 --> 36:59.542
warrants more investigation,
because we will find

36:59.708 --> 37:01.125
more debris.

37:01.250 --> 37:03.208
We will probably find
more planking.

37:03.333 --> 37:05.167
And hopefully,
we'll find something

37:05.292 --> 37:07.833
that would prove that it was
the <i>Captain Lawrence.</i>

37:09.125 --> 37:10.667
MARTY:
Here's the bald truth.

37:10.792 --> 37:12.833
I-I was pretty sure
we weren't gonna find chests

37:13.000 --> 37:16.083
strapped together with
.45 billion dollars in them.

37:16.208 --> 37:17.708
I didn't think
that was gonna happen

37:17.833 --> 37:19.250
on a couple-day dive.

37:19.375 --> 37:22.500
Uh, am I happy with the results,
though? Yes.

37:22.625 --> 37:24.875
Luke has seen intact wrecks,

37:25.000 --> 37:27.333
and yet he's still impressed
with what we found.

37:27.458 --> 37:30.583
And Doug has found
a lot of stuff down by Florida,

37:30.708 --> 37:32.000
and he's impressed
with what we found.

37:32.125 --> 37:33.833
So, that's infectious.
I'm happy.

37:34.000 --> 37:36.375
MATTY:
Well, there's a guy
that's gonna be very interested

37:36.500 --> 37:38.042
and missed what we did today,
and that's your brother, Rick.

37:38.208 --> 37:39.500
MARTY:
He will.

37:47.958 --> 37:50.708
MATTY: Well, I mean, just even
seeing Poverty Island, you know,

37:50.875 --> 37:52.625
coming up on it,
everything you said about it,

37:52.708 --> 37:55.667
I believed you intellectually,
but to see it,

37:55.750 --> 37:57.167
it-it almost
didn't do it justice,

37:57.292 --> 37:58.583
'cause I was like,
"Yes, now I get it."

37:58.708 --> 38:00.917
-The place is spooky.
-Yeah.

38:01.042 --> 38:02.667
What, to me, stood out, though,

38:02.833 --> 38:05.000
in terms
of what we were there to do

38:05.083 --> 38:06.375
was I found it,

38:06.500 --> 38:08.625
like,
a very mitigating circumstance

38:08.708 --> 38:11.500
that if I'm gonna make a run
for open water,

38:11.625 --> 38:13.042
be it through there
or through there,

38:13.208 --> 38:15.208
this is a great area
to dump my treasure

38:15.333 --> 38:16.750
before I make a break for it.

38:16.875 --> 38:18.375
And when you're kind of tucked
behind that island

38:18.500 --> 38:20.042
on the north side,

38:20.167 --> 38:22.583
it suddenly kind of made sense
to me as a good place to look.

38:22.708 --> 38:25.333
We did what divers could do,
but, you know,

38:25.458 --> 38:27.667
this looks little on this map,
but it's big.

38:27.792 --> 38:30.458
But anyway, I-I'm convinced
that this is worth another go.

38:30.542 --> 38:33.167
And in that... in that vein,

38:33.292 --> 38:35.583
uh, I actually got Bob
standing by,

38:35.708 --> 38:38.458
and he-he tells me
he's got some-some new data.

38:38.542 --> 38:39.708
So, I think we should
bring him up on the screen,

38:39.875 --> 38:41.375
-Matty, he's... It's all set.
-Yeah.

38:41.500 --> 38:42.833
It's all set up. And we'll...
Let's see what he says.

38:42.917 --> 38:44.500
-Yeah, absolutely. He's the guy.
-You know...

38:44.667 --> 38:46.792
-You know the passion he has.
-He's the guy.

38:46.917 --> 38:49.625
-MATTY: There he is.
-MARTY: Hello, Bob.
-RICK: Hi, Bob.

38:49.750 --> 38:51.917
<i>-How are you doing?</i>
-We're doing well.

38:52.042 --> 38:53.083
How are you?

38:53.208 --> 38:55.458
I'm doing well myself.

38:55.583 --> 38:57.917
Great. Well, I've got Matty here

38:58.042 --> 39:00.083
and, of course,
big brother Rick.

39:00.208 --> 39:01.917
And I know
you've been crunching through

39:02.042 --> 39:03.917
what we recovered
in the pictures,

39:04.042 --> 39:05.667
but you kind of mentioned

39:05.792 --> 39:08.208
that you've got some...
something new up your sleeve

39:08.333 --> 39:09.583
that might really help.

39:09.708 --> 39:10.875
Is that correct?

39:11.000 --> 39:13.500
Hey, listen, we're working
on something right now

39:13.583 --> 39:16.583
which I think will be
a major breakthrough.

39:19.458 --> 39:21.833
MARTY:
Well, I'm wanting
to hear about that.

39:25.708 --> 39:28.708
-MARTY: What've you got?
-Well, based on our dives

39:28.875 --> 39:31.375
<i>that we took last time, we tok
some of that information,</i>

39:31.500 --> 39:33.333
and we crunched it down,

39:33.458 --> 39:35.458
and I looked
at some of the old records

39:35.542 --> 39:37.167
about the wind conditions
and that,

39:37.292 --> 39:39.417
and hey, I'm ready to go again.

39:39.542 --> 39:43.833
<i>And we've got a new piece
of equipment at our access.</i>

39:44.000 --> 39:47.000
It's an R.O.V. We've got
complete control over it,

39:47.125 --> 39:49.875
<i>and it does have one cord</i>

39:50.000 --> 39:52.333
that brings up the video
and th-- and the controls.

39:52.458 --> 39:54.292
Can we cover more ground, Bob?

39:54.417 --> 39:55.500
Because that's what
I'm convinced,

39:55.625 --> 39:56.875
in our first two attempts,

39:57.000 --> 39:58.208
we just couldn't
cover enough ground.

39:58.375 --> 40:00.458
<i>Yes, this device can cover,</i>

40:00.542 --> 40:03.833
you know, at one crack,
600 feet.

40:04.000 --> 40:06.375
That sounds great.
Diving on an actual picture.

40:06.500 --> 40:08.042
<i>-Yes.</i>
-All right.
Eyes and fins, right?

40:08.208 --> 40:09.250
Eyes and fins.

40:09.375 --> 40:11.417
I'd be so much more
comfortable, too,

40:11.542 --> 40:13.333
now doing it again
and having an image

40:13.500 --> 40:15.000
to dive on as opposed to a hit.

40:15.125 --> 40:17.667
I mean, Bob, we might have
been close last time,

40:17.750 --> 40:20.583
because the divers
showed us pictures...

40:20.708 --> 40:23.833
<i>-Yes.</i>
-...of what you-you felt
might be the rib of a schooner.

40:24.000 --> 40:25.667
-Which would fit.
-Yes.

40:25.792 --> 40:27.667
I've become convinced that this

40:27.833 --> 40:30.333
is well worth pursuing still,

40:30.500 --> 40:32.417
but the next time,
we got to throw more at it.

40:32.542 --> 40:34.458
We got to cover more ground,

40:34.583 --> 40:35.917
we got to, we got to get
a little more rigorous

40:36.042 --> 40:37.333
about how we do this.

40:37.458 --> 40:38.917
But sounds like
you're prepared to do that.

40:39.042 --> 40:40.917
Oh, yes. I agree.

40:41.042 --> 40:42.958
I'm all in.
I want another crack at it.

40:43.042 --> 40:45.333
Yeah, I-I do, too.
I-I just like this one.

40:45.500 --> 40:47.250
I like it for all kinds
of different reasons.

40:47.375 --> 40:48.833
I agree, uh, this is
well worth pursuing.

40:49.000 --> 40:51.250
I mean,
it's-it's in your backyard.

40:51.375 --> 40:52.708
Wha-- Who's gonna
walk away from that?

40:52.833 --> 40:55.083
MARTY:
Bob, I thank you, as always.

40:55.208 --> 40:57.625
You know, you always get us
re-excited about the venture.

40:57.708 --> 41:00.167
So, we will proceed,
and I'll be glad to meet you

41:00.292 --> 41:02.583
out there in the open waters
of Lake Michigan, okay?

41:02.708 --> 41:04.917
-You take care.
-RICK: Take care, Bob.
Good luck.

41:05.042 --> 41:08.417
<i>-Sounds good. Thanks.</i>
-MATTY: Thanks, Bob.
Until the next time.

41:08.542 --> 41:11.500
Ugh, that was incredible.

41:11.583 --> 41:13.417
You know, guys like that,
it's funny.

41:13.542 --> 41:16.000
We keep running
into characters like this

41:16.083 --> 41:17.958
who are doggedly determined.

41:18.083 --> 41:20.833
They're turned on by a story,
and then they just won't quit.

41:20.917 --> 41:23.042
Is it something about
the word "treasure,"

41:23.167 --> 41:24.917
or is it something about

41:25.042 --> 41:27.667
-the ability of human beings...
-Now you know what
the word is, Rick?

41:27.792 --> 41:30.292
...to commit to endeavors
that nothing

41:30.375 --> 41:32.500
can dissuade them
from pursuing it?

41:32.625 --> 41:35.000
The word is "quest."
It's a quest.

41:35.083 --> 41:37.167
MATTY:
There's kind of like
a list of ingredients

41:37.292 --> 41:38.542
-that make these things special.
-Yes.

41:38.708 --> 41:39.583
I don't think there's
one example where it's like:

41:39.708 --> 41:41.667
"Well, a guy buried some gold,

41:41.833 --> 41:43.708
I want that gold," it's always,
"There was espionage,"

41:43.875 --> 41:45.333
-or "There was
a dumping of treasure."
-There's a story.

41:45.458 --> 41:46.750
"There's a story
of a young kid seeing..."

41:46.875 --> 41:48.250
MARTY: And usually,
history's intertwined.

41:48.375 --> 41:49.750
-History's intertwined. Yes.
-Upheavals.

41:49.875 --> 41:51.292
You know,
there's a lot of common threads

41:51.417 --> 41:53.792
that run through
all of these quests.

41:53.875 --> 41:55.750
Yeah, agreed.

41:55.875 --> 41:57.750
But we got a great big one
to attend to right here.

41:57.875 --> 42:00.167
-So, let's-let's get back at it.
Got a lot of work.
-Sure do.

42:00.292 --> 42:02.000
MATTY:
Good job, fellas. That was fun.

42:02.083 --> 42:03.500
MARTY:
Yeah.

42:03.625 --> 42:05.250
