I'm so happy you could make it.

Nice seeing you again, Denise.

And, of course, there's someone I really
want you to meet, this is my fiancÃ©, Will.

13:28.540 --> 13:31.780
- Isn't he cute?
- Cute? That's an understatement.

13:31.950 --> 13:33.410

13:37.420 --> 13:39.510
Gorgeous, no. Man, I'm not.

13:39.690 --> 13:43.620
I got big ears and I got a big high butt,
you know?

13:44.290 --> 13:45.450
Modest too.

13:45.630 --> 13:46.960
What a catch.

13:47.130 --> 13:49.390
Oh, yeah. That's right, Lisa caught me.

13:49.570 --> 13:52.190
Yeah, I'm too big to throw back, though,
ain't I, baby?

[CHUCKLES]

13:54.340 --> 13:55.600
Can I help with something?

13:55.770 --> 13:57.100
Oh, Denise, you're so sweet.

13:57.270 --> 13:59.710
You can actually put those strawberries
in a bowl...

13:59.880 --> 14:01.870
...I'll help Geoffrey put this platter out.

14:02.040 --> 14:04.270
Hey, baby. Hey, babe. Baby.
Baby, I'll help him.

14:04.450 --> 14:06.350
Oh, no, baby,
stay and give Denise a hand.

14:06.520 --> 14:09.310
No, no, no,
I should keep my hands to myself.

14:13.360 --> 14:15.950
Oh, come on, Will, I don't bite.

14:16.130 --> 14:18.290
Unless, of course, you want me to.

Hey. Girl, stop it.

14:20.330 --> 14:22.560
- My fiancÃ©e is right in the other room.
- Mm.

That's what makes it so exciting.

Girl, you're like a black Heather Locklear,
ain't you?

thank you so much for coming.

Thanks for having me.

Listen, I hate to ask, but my ride only
dropped me off so I'm kind of stuck.

14:54.500 --> 14:55.660
You don't suppose...

14:55.830 --> 15:00.430
