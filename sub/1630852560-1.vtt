WEBVTT

03:35.625 --> 03:38.041
In the New Germany.
You can look forward to that.

03:38.125 --> 03:39.791
The New Germany.

03:52.958 --> 03:54.291
Give me a cigarette.

12:27.041 --> 12:28.416
Nice dress she's wearing.

12:28.500 --> 12:29.833
For the parade.

12:55.333 --> 12:56.958
Sir, have you chosen something yet?

12:57.041 --> 12:58.666
-Coffee, black.
-Right away.

13:04.916 --> 13:05.750
Hello.

13:13.250 --> 13:14.083
How did it go?

13:16.625 --> 13:19.083
-Anything for you, sir?
-No, thank you.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.833
Today, he did nothing but yell at them.

13:24.625 --> 13:28.500
The talks with the English
are over once and for all. He's fed up.

13:28.583 --> 13:30.500
Eventually, Henderson just stayed silent.

13:30.583 --> 13:33.708
Wilson got up and left.
Right to the airport and back to London.

13:34.291 --> 13:36.375
And to prove that he means business,

13:36.458 --> 13:39.708
this madman is now sending
a parade of tanks up Wilhemstraße.

13:39.791 --> 13:41.375
-Straight to the British Embassy.
-So?

13:41.458 --> 13:44.625
So, we'll mobilize tomorrow.

13:45.291 --> 13:47.416
-Are you sure?
-I'm sure.

13:49.041 --> 13:50.833
Then we only have a few hours left.

13:58.833 --> 14:00.916
Oster is talking to the generals
right now.

14:03.083 --> 14:04.208
We'll meet tonight.

14:06.791 --> 14:09.625
New place, Alt-Berlin. Ten o'clock.

14:15.541 --> 14:16.666
I have to get back.

14:20.708 --> 14:22.708
Damn, I really am scared shitless.

14:29.500 --> 14:31.416
Can we feed the pigeons?

14:32.166 --> 14:34.166
-Yes.
-Oh, they're hungry.

14:34.791 --> 14:36.500
-What's your name?
-Margarete.

14:37.166 --> 14:38.208
-Here.
-Come here.

14:38.791 --> 14:40.375
You're not afraid of me, are you?

14:42.375 --> 14:43.333
-Frau Limpert?
-Yes?

14:43.416 --> 14:44.916
-I'll take care of it.
-All right.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.041
-Can you tell Herr Plassman, please?
-I will.

15:00.708 --> 15:01.750
Here, let me.

15:01.833 --> 15:02.958
I can do it.

15:06.250 --> 15:08.041
-Herr von Hartmann.
-I can do it.

15:15.250 --> 15:16.208
There.

15:18.500 --> 15:19.333
May I?

16:43.291 --> 16:44.666
Damn fool.

18:00.791 --> 18:04.791
RADIO ADDRESS OF THE BRITISH
PRIME MINISTER NEVILLE CHAMBERLAIN

18:16.208 --> 18:18.166
You're taking it
to the Chancellery yourself?

18:18.250 --> 18:21.791
Yes. I'm very curious
to see how Hitler will reply.

18:22.625 --> 18:24.833
-What about after?
-After?

18:25.416 --> 18:26.291
After.

18:27.125 --> 18:30.375
-After, I have an appointment in Mitte.
-I see. An "appointment"?

18:30.458 --> 18:31.333
Yes.

18:32.958 --> 18:34.166
How mysterious.

18:36.291 --> 18:38.583
Well, until next time, Herr von Hartmann.

18:39.208 --> 18:40.291
Mrs. Winter.

21:10.041 --> 21:12.750
-Get that stuff in there.
-We need two people for the couch.

21:12.833 --> 21:14.458
-Pictures.
-I need to do this first.

21:15.791 --> 21:17.083
Do you need a worker?

21:20.083 --> 21:21.291
Do you need a worker?

21:21.375 --> 21:22.916
HELLO! I AM LOOKING FOR WORK!

21:26.458 --> 21:27.833
Do you need a worker?

21:39.833 --> 21:42.041
Paulie? No way. I can't believe it.

21:43.750 --> 21:44.583
Franz Sauer.

21:44.666 --> 21:46.666
-Little Paulie!
-How are you?

21:47.250 --> 21:50.000
Still busy as a beaver.
How about you? Where are you headed?

21:51.875 --> 21:53.250
To the British Embassy.

21:53.750 --> 21:56.916
I'm delivering the official reply
to Chamberlain's radio broadcast.

21:57.000 --> 21:57.833
-Seriously?
-Yes.

22:00.416 --> 22:01.583
No kidding?

22:02.166 --> 22:04.625
Who would've thought
that you'd be delivering messages

22:04.708 --> 22:05.958
between world leaders?

22:06.541 --> 22:09.666
-And I'd be protecting the Führer himself.
-You're with the bodyguard?

22:09.750 --> 22:11.166
Führer Escort Command.

22:11.958 --> 22:13.041
One of 27.

22:13.125 --> 22:14.125
Congratulations.

22:14.208 --> 22:15.958
Paulie, one of just 27.

22:16.041 --> 22:17.000
Congratulations.

22:17.083 --> 22:20.666
But everyone always knew
that you'd make it to the top one day.

22:20.750 --> 22:23.958
-It baffles me every day that I have.
-Nonsense. We've always been winners.

22:24.041 --> 22:25.291
-Not me.
-Always.

22:25.375 --> 22:27.583
-Back on our soccer team?
-But no thanks to me.

22:27.666 --> 22:31.750
That was you, Franz. Our opposition
peed their pants in fear of you.

22:31.833 --> 22:34.333
Yeah, there was no getting past.
Certainly not past me.

22:37.708 --> 22:40.416
Well, Paul, don't let me keep you.
Hurry along. Duty calls.

22:40.500 --> 22:41.833
I'll see you around, Franz.

22:41.916 --> 22:44.541
Not if I see you first,
Paulie von Hartmann!

22:48.041 --> 22:50.208
Hey! Those aren't your potatoes!

25:17.708 --> 25:19.291
Scrub…

25:19.375 --> 25:22.125
Look at them! Watch closely!

25:23.625 --> 25:27.750
This is the place where the Jew belongs.

25:35.416 --> 25:36.791
Keep scrubbing!

25:38.333 --> 25:40.208
I said keep scrubbing!

25:41.791 --> 25:46.041
Into the cracks, as well.
Keep scrubbing! I said keep scrubbing!

25:46.125 --> 25:47.333
You missed a spot!

25:48.750 --> 25:51.750
Look at him, this Jewish pig!

25:52.458 --> 25:56.666
How his presence ruined the very ground!

25:59.208 --> 26:02.375
Your soft breath gives solace…

26:02.458 --> 26:03.708
The cracks as well.

26:03.791 --> 26:07.291
Keep scrubbing! I said keep scrubbing!

26:07.375 --> 26:13.000
In your arms

26:13.083 --> 26:16.166
For hours walking barefoot

26:16.250 --> 26:19.333
Over the soft moss

26:20.916 --> 26:23.500
You're silently dreaming

26:24.250 --> 26:28.000
Of strange star signs

26:28.083 --> 26:31.250
The golden locks

26:31.333 --> 26:34.875
Kindled by the moon

26:35.958 --> 26:38.958
I see the longing

26:39.041 --> 26:40.500
But you can't stay…

26:40.583 --> 26:42.333
-Sorry.
-Thought you'd got lost.

26:45.166 --> 26:46.000
What?

26:47.166 --> 26:49.416
Very strange to meet you here,
Lieutenant Colonel.

26:49.500 --> 26:51.791
-I've never seen you out of uniform.
-One second.

26:52.583 --> 26:54.625
Andi, three schnapps.

26:54.708 --> 26:56.208
Three schnapps, coming right up.

26:59.083 --> 27:00.125
Go ahead.

27:01.416 --> 27:04.000
Everyone was there,
all the top-ranking defense generals.

27:04.500 --> 27:05.833
And they all confirmed again

27:05.916 --> 27:08.833
that there is strong opposition
to a war with the Czechs.

27:10.291 --> 27:12.750
This is the moment we've been waiting for.

27:13.916 --> 27:16.875
At two o'clock tomorrow,
when Hitler gives the order to invade,

27:17.750 --> 27:19.416
the Wehrmacht will step in.

27:20.500 --> 27:23.791
-And the three of us are the key.
-What exactly does that mean?

27:23.875 --> 27:25.208
We go to the Chancellery.

27:25.708 --> 27:28.625
We make sure
that all important entry points are clear.

27:28.708 --> 27:31.791
Then we give the signal to step in,
and Hitler will be arrested.

27:31.875 --> 27:34.583
You believe that the Wehrmacht
will take action against him?

27:34.666 --> 27:36.750
War with the Czechs, that's…

27:37.250 --> 27:39.416
That means war with Britain and France.

27:39.500 --> 27:42.208
That's crazy!
It's the last thing the generals want.

27:42.291 --> 27:45.500
Right, Hans.
But still, I don't trust the generals.

27:46.333 --> 27:47.916
They're not opposed to him.

27:48.000 --> 27:51.000
They're just opposed to war
because they're scared they'll lose it.

27:51.500 --> 27:52.916
Is this really the only plan?

27:53.458 --> 27:55.458
It's the only plan we have, Erich.

27:57.791 --> 28:00.000
It all sounds so incredibly fragile.

28:01.375 --> 28:03.625
Have you ever wondered if we're wrong?

28:04.708 --> 28:06.083
What if we're mistaken?

28:06.166 --> 28:08.416
What if he's right,
and he's telling the truth

28:08.500 --> 28:11.875
that he just wants to take back
the territories that belong to Germany?

28:11.958 --> 28:13.125
And he'll stop there?

28:13.208 --> 28:14.250
Then leave, Erich.

28:14.333 --> 28:15.833
He's a small, vulgar man.

28:15.916 --> 28:17.625
Hitler is like a thug.

28:19.125 --> 28:22.416
He only knows his own personal truth.
He'll keep taking more and more.

28:22.500 --> 28:24.666
-More people will get hurt.
-How do you know?

28:24.750 --> 28:26.875
-He'll never stop!
-It's not the time to argue!

28:28.666 --> 28:31.041
-Tomorrow, tomorrow is the day--
-Three schnapps.

28:39.375 --> 28:40.791
Are you with us, Erich?

28:44.416 --> 28:47.125
Let's assume
Hitler gets arrested tomorrow.

28:47.833 --> 28:48.916
What happens then?

28:52.500 --> 28:53.750
We shoot the bastard.

28:55.125 --> 28:56.333
If he doesn't surrender.

28:58.041 --> 29:01.333
Tomorrow at two o'clock, we will hear
that mobilization is beginning.

29:01.416 --> 29:02.458
That will be our cue.

29:04.458 --> 29:07.666
Friends, history is watching us.

29:09.750 --> 29:11.125
Sometime tomorrow night,

29:11.958 --> 29:13.791
this whole nightmare will be over.

29:18.458 --> 29:21.791
I see the longing

29:21.875 --> 29:25.375
But you can't stay

29:26.458 --> 29:30.583
Come dance through the blue night

29:30.666 --> 29:33.458
With me one more time

30:02.041 --> 30:04.750
-What? You want to arrest him?
-That's the plan, yeah.

30:04.833 --> 30:07.208
-You think that could work?
-Yes.

30:07.291 --> 30:09.208
This Wehrmacht will turn against the boss?

30:09.291 --> 30:11.958
Never. Mark my words.
I was married to a general.

30:12.041 --> 30:13.833
Your husband was a disloyal asshole.

30:13.916 --> 30:15.958
Yes, to me, maybe, but never to Hitler.

30:16.041 --> 30:18.375
When he mobilizes tomorrow,
we will stop him.

30:18.458 --> 30:20.916
-You want him to mobilize?
-Yes, damn it!

30:21.000 --> 30:23.500
If he doesn't go to war,
you can't stop him.

30:23.583 --> 30:26.583
But, Paul, that means you need this war.
That's totally perverse.

30:26.666 --> 30:30.416
Of course that's perverse, Helen.
Without a crime, there can be no arrest.

30:34.791 --> 30:35.625
What?

30:37.666 --> 30:39.458
I'm considering if I should trust you.

30:44.333 --> 30:47.583
-You've already trusted me.
-This is something different.

30:48.250 --> 30:49.083
What is it?

31:06.416 --> 31:08.250
FOREIGN OFFICE
POLITICAL DEPARTMENT

31:11.000 --> 31:11.833
What's this?

31:13.416 --> 31:16.125
I got it from the Foreign Office.
I took it today.

31:20.875 --> 31:21.833
What's this?

31:23.666 --> 31:26.416
This is his true plan for Europe.

31:33.250 --> 31:37.416
PROTOCOL OF THE MEETING IN THE CHANCELLERY
ON NOVEMBER 5, 1937

31:55.083 --> 31:56.375
They'll arrest you for this.

31:59.041 --> 32:00.125
I'm aware.

32:10.458 --> 32:12.875
-This is appalling.
-What are you going to do with it?

32:17.416 --> 32:19.375
What are you going to do with it?

41:21.416 --> 41:22.250
Gentlemen.

41:24.625 --> 41:25.833
Is it starting?

41:26.333 --> 41:29.583
Mussolini talked Hitler into a conference
with Chamberlain and Daladier.

41:30.291 --> 41:31.541
Tomorrow in Munich.

41:32.916 --> 41:35.583
They're going to sacrifice the Sudetenland
to prevent war.

41:36.666 --> 41:39.416
-Damn it!
-They're doing exactly what he wants.

41:40.291 --> 41:43.250
-Will the Wehrmacht move against him?
-We can forget about that.

41:44.291 --> 41:46.041
-Not a chance.
-So this is it?

41:53.833 --> 41:55.750
-God damn it!
-Honestly, please.

41:56.333 --> 41:57.250
Pardon me.

41:58.291 --> 42:00.041
What do the gentlemen plan on doing?

42:00.625 --> 42:04.708
It's as good as decided.
A conference like this is a formality.

42:04.791 --> 42:06.875
You need to find a way
to meet Chamberlain.

42:06.958 --> 42:09.250
You have to prevent this agreement
from being made.

42:11.000 --> 42:12.708
Thank God you can still laugh.

42:14.791 --> 42:15.750
Show him the proof.

42:17.000 --> 42:19.666
-What proof?
-That Hitler is bent on a war of conquest.

42:24.416 --> 42:25.916
I am in possession of a document.

42:26.000 --> 42:27.000
What kind of document?

42:27.500 --> 42:28.666
Trust me, please.

42:33.833 --> 42:35.041
-Paul.
-Can I just…

42:36.541 --> 42:37.791
Just a moment…

42:48.750 --> 42:51.291
HUGH LEGAT

42:54.083 --> 42:56.125
Hugh Legat
is one of Chamberlain's secretaries.

42:56.833 --> 43:01.958
Can you arrange for him to come to Munich?
That he's part of the English delegation?

43:03.208 --> 43:04.375
Possibly, yes.

43:05.416 --> 43:07.458
-Will he be expecting--
-No.

43:08.875 --> 43:10.333
But he will help us.

43:11.333 --> 43:12.291
All right.

43:13.750 --> 43:15.708
Right, I'll do what I can.

43:16.583 --> 43:17.625
Gentlemen.

43:26.375 --> 43:28.291
And can you get Paul into the conference?

43:30.458 --> 43:32.375
I'll try and add you as an interpreter.

43:35.750 --> 43:36.958
I have to get back.

43:47.750 --> 43:49.083
What's happening here?

43:53.333 --> 43:55.416
Do you think
you can smuggle illegal documents

43:55.500 --> 43:57.583
into an international conference

43:57.666 --> 44:00.333
and have a secret meeting
with the British prime minister,

44:00.416 --> 44:02.291
right under the Führer's nose?

44:04.583 --> 44:05.583
Yes.

44:12.125 --> 44:13.083
Oh, Paul?

44:21.625 --> 44:23.250
Then you should have this with you.

44:34.583 --> 44:35.500
Ever used one?

44:36.833 --> 44:38.583
As children, we used to shoot rabbits.

44:42.375 --> 44:43.375
This is different.

44:43.458 --> 44:45.500
The principle's the same, right?

44:47.708 --> 44:48.583
Thanks.

47:38.666 --> 47:42.791
The German Reich!
Vote for the German Reich!

47:42.875 --> 47:45.375
Which government is in the right?
The answer is…

47:45.458 --> 47:47.000
Cast your pivotal vote!

48:06.416 --> 48:08.333
It's his vacation. He's the guest.

48:08.416 --> 48:10.083
FOR LIST 2, VOTE NSDAP

48:11.291 --> 48:12.208
Thirsty!

48:30.250 --> 48:31.708
You're not going there.

48:32.375 --> 48:33.208
Pardon?

48:33.291 --> 48:34.541
You're too drunk, Lena.

48:34.625 --> 48:36.833
I see. I'm too drunk.

48:38.250 --> 48:39.083
I'm going.

48:39.166 --> 48:41.125
Well, I won't come. Not with you two.

48:42.625 --> 48:43.916
Okay, then don't.

49:31.083 --> 49:32.916
You lot, hey! Can I ask you something?

49:33.000 --> 49:34.125
-What?
-What do you want?

49:34.208 --> 49:35.916
-Who are you going to vote for?
-Why?

49:36.000 --> 49:37.291
What do you think of Hitler?

49:37.375 --> 49:41.125
Hitler makes us proud to be German again!

49:41.208 --> 49:44.291
-Thank you! Thank you very much.
-Who are you lot going to vote for?

49:44.375 --> 49:45.750
-Hitler!
-Thank you.

49:45.833 --> 49:47.041
See? The future.

49:47.125 --> 49:48.458
Yes!

49:54.041 --> 49:55.000
Paul,

49:55.958 --> 49:57.875
people are leaving the country.

49:57.958 --> 50:00.791
Families are getting on boats to America.

50:00.875 --> 50:03.208
If that's what they decide,
they are free to do so.

50:03.291 --> 50:05.458
-They don't just decide like that!
-Bullshit!

50:05.541 --> 50:07.375
People don't want to live here anymore.

50:07.458 --> 50:10.708
They are scared to live in this country.
That's not just bullshit!

50:22.583 --> 50:25.166
Fa-na-ti-cal.

50:33.791 --> 50:35.041
Fuck you!

50:51.833 --> 50:53.708
-Be quiet!
-Exactly!

50:53.791 --> 50:56.958
You're talking down to me like a child.
I'm supposed to be grateful for that?

50:57.041 --> 51:00.041
I'm sick of being grateful!
And I'm sick of you too.

52:04.291 --> 52:05.916
-Well?
-Here are your papers.

52:06.000 --> 52:08.250
They barely got you on the list.

52:10.208 --> 52:11.041
Ready?

52:12.750 --> 52:13.583
Are you coming?

52:13.666 --> 52:16.416
Someone needs to make sure
you don't do anything stupid.

52:20.958 --> 52:22.458
Go, hurry. See you in Munich.

52:30.583 --> 52:34.375
EMIGRATE! GO TO JERUSALEM!

52:44.750 --> 52:46.000
This is your compartment.

52:46.916 --> 52:47.750
Thank you.

53:41.041 --> 53:43.000
-Cramped but cozy, huh?
-Yeah!

53:43.666 --> 53:46.458
Helmut, no visits from women.

53:46.541 --> 53:47.625
Of course, you know me.

53:49.083 --> 53:50.083
This is me.

53:50.791 --> 53:53.750
-There's someone in there already. Hello?
-Yes

53:57.458 --> 53:58.500
Paulie?

53:58.583 --> 53:59.458
Hello, Franz.

53:59.541 --> 54:00.958
What are you doing here?

54:02.708 --> 54:04.458
It seems they need my help…

54:04.541 --> 54:05.583
I see.

54:05.666 --> 54:06.791
…with interpreting.

54:06.875 --> 54:10.000
-No one told me.
-Yes, it was a last-minute decision.

54:11.875 --> 54:12.916
Is this your bunk?

54:13.833 --> 54:14.833
Yes.

54:15.916 --> 54:18.833
Then we're roommates.

54:18.916 --> 54:19.916
Yeah.

54:20.000 --> 54:21.250
Like in the old days.

54:23.041 --> 54:24.958
-Like in the old days!
-Yeah, excellent!

54:25.041 --> 54:27.041
Excellent, right?

54:29.791 --> 54:30.791
Great.

54:33.166 --> 54:34.875
Okay, may I? One second.

54:34.958 --> 54:35.916
Yeah.

54:36.750 --> 54:38.125
-See you in a bit, I…
-See you.

57:44.958 --> 57:46.875
You caught me.

57:46.958 --> 57:48.500
Can I assist you?

57:48.583 --> 57:50.750
I know it looks bad,
but it's nothing personal.

57:50.833 --> 57:52.000
We all have our orders.

57:52.750 --> 57:55.625
I'm relieved to be able to tell you
that everything is in order.

57:58.708 --> 58:00.166
You can put it back now.

58:01.083 --> 58:02.166
Thank you so much.

58:02.666 --> 58:04.916
Come on, Paulie. Are you cross now?

58:05.000 --> 58:07.833
Do I hear you being cross now?
Is Paulie cross?

58:07.916 --> 58:09.250
Cross little Paulie!

58:10.166 --> 58:11.625
Paulie, come on!

58:14.791 --> 58:16.041
Defend yourself!

58:17.166 --> 58:18.458
Come on, defend yourself!

58:21.958 --> 58:22.916
-Von Hartmann?
-That's me.

58:23.000 --> 58:25.750
Dr. Schmidt. Head of translation.
Do you have a moment?

58:25.833 --> 58:28.000
-Of course.
-I'm very pleased to meet you.

58:28.083 --> 58:31.375
I'm relieved
I don't have to do all of it by myself.

58:32.166 --> 58:35.125
When we arrive in Munich,
I will handle the Führer, the Duce,

58:35.208 --> 58:37.416
the prime minister,
and the président du conseil.

58:37.500 --> 58:39.791
And you can deal with the smaller stuff.

58:39.875 --> 58:41.500
What other languages do you speak?

58:41.583 --> 58:45.791
French, Italian, and a little,
really just a little bit of Ru…

58:45.875 --> 58:48.625
The Russians aren't invited,
and neither are the Czechs.

58:48.708 --> 58:51.125
Don't worry.
I'll brief you on the details later.

58:51.208 --> 58:54.541
Right now, the Führer is waiting
for his foreign press summary.

58:54.625 --> 58:55.916
Can you take care of that?

58:58.000 --> 58:59.458
-Right now?
-Yes, right now.

59:04.500 --> 59:05.750
What do I have to do?

59:05.833 --> 59:07.291
Look him in the eye.

59:07.375 --> 59:09.541
Don't speak
unless you're spoken to directly.

59:09.625 --> 59:11.166
And don't smell of smoke.

59:11.250 --> 59:14.041
If you stink of smoke,
he'll throw you out.

59:25.083 --> 59:26.833
-Heil Hitler.
-Heil Hitler.

59:26.916 --> 59:29.083
Von Hartmann,
press summary for the Führer.

59:47.333 --> 59:48.333
Who wrote this?

59:48.416 --> 59:51.666
That's the editorial
in the London Times, my Führer.

59:53.625 --> 59:55.416
Have you spent time in England?

59:56.333 --> 59:57.833
I was at Oxford for two years.

1:00:00.625 --> 1:00:01.583
I can hear that.

1:00:05.166 --> 1:00:06.250
Von Hartmann.

1:00:13.208 --> 1:00:16.500
You're ambitious. Good.

1:00:17.083 --> 1:00:20.208
You're intelligent. Good.

1:00:20.291 --> 1:00:22.583
Maybe you think
you're more intelligent than me?

1:00:23.625 --> 1:00:25.041
-I--
-I can read people.

1:00:26.583 --> 1:00:29.416
The way professors at those universities
read books.

1:00:33.291 --> 1:00:34.291
Oxford.

1:00:36.583 --> 1:00:40.333
I see who you are.

1:00:44.041 --> 1:00:45.083
Do you see me?

1:00:46.416 --> 1:00:47.500
Yes, my Führer.

1:00:47.583 --> 1:00:50.875
You know the English.
What are they thinking?

1:00:54.291 --> 1:00:55.416
They underestimate you.

1:00:55.500 --> 1:00:56.416
Correct.

1:01:00.000 --> 1:01:01.375
The maps, my Führer.

1:01:04.750 --> 1:01:06.166
The new course for the border.

1:01:07.041 --> 1:01:11.333
We have 40 divisions
to destroy the Czechs with.

1:01:12.583 --> 1:01:14.791
We could have it done within a week.

1:01:14.875 --> 1:01:15.875
Yes, my Führer.

1:01:16.375 --> 1:01:18.916
The train is heading
in the wrong direction.

1:01:20.041 --> 1:01:21.750
Why these detours?

1:01:27.708 --> 1:01:28.708
Good, thank you.

1:02:21.125 --> 1:02:22.583
PEACE IN EUROPE

1:02:32.125 --> 1:02:33.833
WELCOME CHAMBERLAIN

1:02:43.750 --> 1:02:44.875
How was your flight?

1:02:44.958 --> 1:02:46.916
It was very uncomfortable.

1:02:47.708 --> 1:02:48.833
I have a very sore back.

1:03:01.583 --> 1:03:02.708
Welcome.

1:03:05.333 --> 1:03:06.333
-Hello.
-How do you do?

1:03:06.416 --> 1:03:07.458
Welcome. Pardon me.

1:03:08.750 --> 1:03:09.833
-Welcome.
-Hello.

1:03:13.208 --> 1:03:14.500
Attention!

1:03:29.791 --> 1:03:31.500
We'll talk upstairs. Tell him that.

1:03:32.708 --> 1:03:35.083
Just the four of us.
You and one advisor each.

1:03:35.166 --> 1:03:36.291
Yes, my Führer.

1:03:36.375 --> 1:03:37.625
Thank you.

1:03:37.708 --> 1:03:40.791
-…saw him carry himself with confidence.
-Indeed.

1:03:40.875 --> 1:03:42.125
I'll go give him the rest.

1:03:42.208 --> 1:03:44.583
I require a watch. Lend me yours, please.

1:03:47.125 --> 1:03:51.125
He apparently thinks he won't get it back.
He thinks the Führer is a watch thief.

1:03:54.458 --> 1:03:56.708
He thinks he's one of the clever ones.

1:03:57.708 --> 1:03:59.250
Well, let's get it over with.

1:03:59.333 --> 1:04:00.375
Very well, sir.

1:04:32.583 --> 1:04:35.750
Well, please excuse me a moment.

1:06:28.291 --> 1:06:30.791
-Oh, sorry!
-Watch it!

1:06:35.333 --> 1:06:36.458
Your ID, please.

1:07:20.166 --> 1:07:23.916
Hartman, have you noticed
how often Göring changed outfits today?

1:07:24.000 --> 1:07:26.416
This is the third uniform
I've seen him wear today.

1:07:29.458 --> 1:07:32.083
But don't let that--
Oh, there's Schmidt. He needs you.

1:07:37.291 --> 1:07:39.625
The Führer wishes
for the ambassadors to join now.

1:07:39.708 --> 1:07:42.083
Fetch François-Poncet and Henderson.
Quickly, please.

1:07:47.583 --> 1:07:48.625
Mr. Ambassador.

1:07:52.208 --> 1:07:53.250
Right away.

1:08:17.166 --> 1:08:21.750
I… Follow me without anyone seeing.

1:09:43.125 --> 1:09:45.916
-Hello. Do you happen to have the time?
-No. I'm sorry.

1:09:46.000 --> 1:09:49.541
Thanks anyway.Damn it.

1:10:00.083 --> 1:10:01.750
HUBERS

1:10:57.375 --> 1:11:00.750
Excuse me. Some beer? Two pale lagers.

1:11:03.750 --> 1:11:04.666
You're married?

1:11:06.250 --> 1:11:07.083
Yes.

1:11:07.750 --> 1:11:08.583
Happily?

1:11:09.541 --> 1:11:10.541
So-so.

1:11:11.666 --> 1:11:12.958
What about you?

1:11:13.916 --> 1:11:14.750
No.

1:11:16.833 --> 1:11:17.833
You're turning gray.

1:11:18.750 --> 1:11:20.833
And you still don't need to shave.

1:11:24.166 --> 1:11:25.000
Where's Lena?

1:11:27.083 --> 1:11:29.083
We don't speak anymore.

1:11:32.041 --> 1:11:34.083
My pleasure. Cheers.

1:11:39.916 --> 1:11:43.958
Hugh, we both, you and I,

1:11:44.750 --> 1:11:46.958
are the last hope of stopping Hitler.

1:11:53.500 --> 1:11:56.958
They're going to make a deal.
Tomorrow or the day after.

1:11:57.041 --> 1:11:58.958
I know. That's the problem.

1:11:59.041 --> 1:12:00.041
Why?

1:12:00.125 --> 1:12:03.083
Make your deal,
and Hitler becomes even more powerful.

1:12:03.166 --> 1:12:04.250
We're preventing a war.

1:12:04.333 --> 1:12:06.875
No, you're not. You're not!

1:12:06.958 --> 1:12:10.333
I know it's awful for the Czechs
to lose these territories,

1:12:10.416 --> 1:12:12.500
but if you invade tomorrow,

1:12:12.583 --> 1:12:15.166
tens of thousands
of innocent people will die.

1:12:15.250 --> 1:12:19.750
Yes. And if we don't invade tomorrow,
then soon maybe millions will die.

1:12:21.166 --> 1:12:22.000
Millions.

1:12:23.083 --> 1:12:25.708
You have no idea who he is.

1:12:25.791 --> 1:12:28.208
If you did, none of you would be here.

1:12:31.458 --> 1:12:32.708
What do you want from me?

1:12:35.666 --> 1:12:37.291
A meeting with Chamberlain.

1:12:37.916 --> 1:12:38.750
Tonight.

1:12:39.541 --> 1:12:43.750
Help me. Hugh. You're his secretary.
Secretaries arrange meetings.

1:12:43.833 --> 1:12:46.416
-But not secret meetings with you.
-There has to be a way.

1:12:46.500 --> 1:12:49.708
It's impossible.
And what do you want to tell him?

1:12:51.083 --> 1:12:52.791
What do you want to tell him?

1:12:55.666 --> 1:12:56.875
Trust me, he knows.

1:12:57.750 --> 1:12:59.083
I can prove it.

1:13:00.541 --> 1:13:01.625
Is that amusing to you?

1:13:03.208 --> 1:13:04.625
I'd forgotten what you're like.

1:13:05.416 --> 1:13:08.375
-You don't want to help me.
-I can't.

1:13:08.458 --> 1:13:11.958
I can't! Not with a private meeting.

1:13:15.083 --> 1:13:19.333
But if you have information
we should know about,

1:13:19.833 --> 1:13:23.333
I can try to arrange
for the prime minister to see it.

1:13:24.750 --> 1:13:26.583
Before he signs anything?

1:13:30.791 --> 1:13:32.000
I can try.

1:13:33.291 --> 1:13:34.125
Yes.

1:13:37.833 --> 1:13:38.791
Excuse me, sir.

1:13:38.875 --> 1:13:41.125
If you're done with the Stürmer,
could I have it?

1:13:41.208 --> 1:13:44.000
-Of course.
-Yeah? And could I keep it as well?

1:13:44.083 --> 1:13:45.250
-Of course.
-Are you sure?

1:13:45.333 --> 1:13:47.000
-Yes.
-Thank you very much.

1:13:53.125 --> 1:13:54.208
JEW CENTRAL PRAGUE

1:15:49.166 --> 1:15:51.375
How's your afternoon, Herr von Hartmann?

1:15:51.458 --> 1:15:53.666
Arduous, Frau Winter. And yours?

1:15:53.750 --> 1:15:55.375
Well, I'm hanging in there.

1:15:56.833 --> 1:15:59.500
-Did you meet with your English friend?
-I did.

1:15:59.583 --> 1:16:01.416
-And?
-And we'll see.

1:16:07.125 --> 1:16:08.083
Did something happen?

1:16:08.166 --> 1:16:10.375
Yes, you could say that.

1:16:11.166 --> 1:16:12.500
We have an agreement.

1:16:13.000 --> 1:16:15.750
An agreement for the immediate handover
of the Sudetenland…

1:16:15.833 --> 1:16:17.791
Congratulations, Schmidt. Excellent work.

1:16:17.875 --> 1:16:18.708
Thank you.

1:16:18.791 --> 1:16:20.125
…to the German Empire.

1:16:20.916 --> 1:16:22.666
We'll get everything we wanted.

1:16:22.750 --> 1:16:25.541
I thought it would take
at least another day.

1:16:25.625 --> 1:16:28.041
Yes, it would have
if Chamberlain had had his way.

1:16:28.125 --> 1:16:31.041
He wanted to wear down the Führer
with the smallest details.

1:16:31.125 --> 1:16:33.708
-The man is a bean counter.
-Have they signed already?

1:16:34.500 --> 1:16:37.583
What? The treaties are being drawn up
right now. They'll sign after dinner.

1:16:37.666 --> 1:16:39.333
And straighten your tie.

1:16:39.416 --> 1:16:42.500
The two of us have been invited
to the dining room with the Führer.

1:16:42.583 --> 1:16:44.833
-Oh God.
-What, "Oh God"? Von Hartmann.

1:16:44.916 --> 1:16:46.833
Herr von Hartmann, that's a great honor.

1:16:46.916 --> 1:16:48.666
-Yes.
-Quite right, Fräulein…

1:16:48.750 --> 1:16:50.666
-Frau Winter.
-Frau Winter.

1:16:51.333 --> 1:16:54.333
Anyway, the English and the French
aren't staying for dinner.

1:16:54.416 --> 1:16:55.833
They've lost their appetite.

1:16:55.916 --> 1:16:58.458
-So we were asked to fill the ranks.
-Dr. Schmidt!

1:16:59.791 --> 1:17:01.708
Well, looks like I'm needed again.

1:17:55.125 --> 1:17:56.791
Don't drink too much, von Hartmann.

1:17:56.875 --> 1:17:58.125
Just wet your lips.

1:17:59.083 --> 1:18:01.083
We still have a lot of work ahead of us.

1:18:01.833 --> 1:18:04.875
Tomorrow, the world will watch Munich
and our translations.

1:18:04.958 --> 1:18:06.041
Of course.

1:18:06.125 --> 1:18:07.833
We can't afford any mistakes.

1:18:09.458 --> 1:18:11.708
…he has some skill.
He's not a bad negotiator.

1:18:56.875 --> 1:18:59.083
-Excuse me.
-Von Hartmann?

1:19:09.250 --> 1:19:10.541
Where are you going?

1:19:16.583 --> 1:19:20.333
Excuse me, my Führer. I'm needed
for the translation of the agreement.

1:19:21.083 --> 1:19:21.916
Come here.

1:19:44.250 --> 1:19:46.625
I never forget a personal obligation.

1:19:48.791 --> 1:19:50.125
For Germany,

1:19:50.208 --> 1:19:53.833
I am prepared to be dishonest
a thousand times over.

1:19:55.041 --> 1:19:56.833
For myself, never.

1:20:05.250 --> 1:20:06.708
I'm no watch thief.

1:20:14.500 --> 1:20:15.583
Thank you, my Führer.

1:20:25.208 --> 1:20:28.041
To the good health
of our dear Italian friends.

1:20:28.666 --> 1:20:29.750
And to the Führer.

1:20:29.833 --> 1:20:31.041
To the Führer.

1:29:08.666 --> 1:29:10.291
-Mr. President of the Council.
-Yes?

1:29:10.375 --> 1:29:12.000
Thank you for your cooperation.

1:29:12.083 --> 1:29:14.833
I think we have come
to a very good agreement.

1:29:24.083 --> 1:29:25.041
There they are.

1:29:27.333 --> 1:29:30.000
…the Czechs aren't here
given the circumstances.

1:29:35.541 --> 1:29:37.208
Oh, there's Monsieur Daladier.

1:29:37.291 --> 1:29:40.458
Mr. Daladier, how was your dinner?

1:29:55.916 --> 1:29:57.750
Are you looking for someone?

1:29:57.833 --> 1:30:00.833
Yes, thank you.
About the arrangements for the press?

1:30:00.916 --> 1:30:02.541
Who's responsible for that?

1:30:05.958 --> 1:30:08.291
Enjoy the rest of your stay
in Munich, Mr. Legat.

1:30:12.041 --> 1:30:13.666
What did you want from him?

1:30:13.750 --> 1:30:16.166
Can a British photographer
be at the signing?

1:30:16.250 --> 1:30:17.375
No chance.

1:30:17.458 --> 1:30:20.708
Only the Führer's personal photographer
has permission to take pictures.

1:30:35.583 --> 1:30:38.083
-Gentlemen!
-We should stop talking.

1:34:22.666 --> 1:34:23.833
It's me, Hugh.

1:43:53.250 --> 1:43:54.708
What are you doing here?

1:43:54.791 --> 1:43:57.625
I mean, what the hell
are you doing here in Munich?

1:43:57.708 --> 1:44:00.208
What are you doing here in Munich?
What's going on here?

1:44:01.375 --> 1:44:04.125
What is going on here? Talk to me!

1:44:04.208 --> 1:44:05.500
I don't know--

1:44:16.791 --> 1:44:19.791
Now, let's talk. Come on. Talk to me!

1:44:42.208 --> 1:44:45.875
I would suggest you go back
where you came from.

1:44:46.916 --> 1:44:47.791
Legat.

1:48:52.375 --> 1:48:53.833
The foreign press summary!

1:49:55.541 --> 1:49:57.375
The Reichsführer is arriving.

1:50:00.291 --> 1:50:01.958
Please excuse me, my Führer.

1:50:12.541 --> 1:50:17.166
"The cheers for Hitler
were mechanical and polite."

1:50:18.333 --> 1:50:20.708
"For Chamberlain, they were ecstatic."

1:50:25.250 --> 1:50:29.625
You, as an educated German,
what do you think? Are they right?

1:50:32.125 --> 1:50:34.875
I do not wish to be followed mechanically!

1:50:36.250 --> 1:50:38.458
I gave Germany back its dignity.

1:50:38.541 --> 1:50:41.208
Is it too much
to ask for a little gratitude?

1:50:43.250 --> 1:50:44.500
"Mechanical."

1:50:45.416 --> 1:50:48.166
They're grateful
to this asshole Chamberlain!

1:50:51.083 --> 1:50:56.666
Am I the only one who realizes
that we have a historic task ahead of us?

1:50:57.708 --> 1:51:01.500
That this is the moment
for Germany to fulfill its destiny?

1:51:08.791 --> 1:51:10.833
Speak. I want you to answer me.

1:51:11.875 --> 1:51:13.291
Why aren't they grateful?

1:51:14.541 --> 1:51:18.166
The people don't want a war.
They're afraid.

1:51:18.250 --> 1:51:20.041
The people don't know what they want.

1:51:20.958 --> 1:51:22.125
They're children.

1:51:23.375 --> 1:51:26.083
But you're right. They are afraid.

1:51:26.166 --> 1:51:27.916
I am surrounded by cowardice.

1:51:28.958 --> 1:51:29.875
Yes, my Führer.

1:51:44.333 --> 1:51:47.416
I told you, I can read people.

1:51:50.750 --> 1:51:52.041
You say yes,

1:51:54.000 --> 1:51:55.375
but your eyes…

1:51:57.625 --> 1:51:58.666
are saying no.

1:52:03.416 --> 1:52:05.583
It's just you and I here.

1:52:05.666 --> 1:52:06.750
So,

1:52:07.708 --> 1:52:10.041
what are you thinking, von Hartmann?

1:52:12.708 --> 1:52:14.625
What do you…

1:52:16.833 --> 1:52:18.041
want to say to me?

1:52:22.750 --> 1:52:23.750
Nothing.

1:52:31.250 --> 1:52:32.791
Heil, my Führer.

1:52:32.875 --> 1:52:35.833
I'm told you've signed another agreement
with Chamberlain?

1:52:35.916 --> 1:52:39.541
Don't take that so seriously.
That piece of paper is of no significance.

1:52:40.875 --> 1:52:43.916
The problem lies here,
with the German people.

1:52:46.583 --> 1:52:47.416
Anything else?

1:52:55.500 --> 1:52:56.333
Thank you.

1:52:58.875 --> 1:52:59.833
For

1:53:00.791 --> 1:53:01.750
this.

1:53:33.291 --> 1:53:34.250
Thank you.

1:54:36.416 --> 1:54:38.458
I assume you're waiting for me?

1:54:39.625 --> 1:54:40.583
No, actually.

1:54:41.875 --> 1:54:42.708
No?

1:54:42.791 --> 1:54:47.166
Not today, Paulie.
Not today, but soon. Very soon.

1:54:49.250 --> 1:54:50.208
Well, then.

1:54:51.333 --> 1:54:52.666
-My regards--
-Get out.

2:00:28.375 --> 2:00:29.916
I could have shot Hitler.

2:00:35.625 --> 2:00:37.791
I was so close to him,
I could smell his breath.

2:00:42.541 --> 2:00:44.583
I could feel the gun in my hand.

2:00:54.708 --> 2:00:56.666
But my hand wouldn't move.

2:00:58.208 --> 2:00:59.333
Do you know why?

2:01:07.000 --> 2:01:08.541
What would give me the right?

2:01:17.000 --> 2:01:18.416
Do you want to keep going?

2:01:22.916 --> 2:01:25.250
What other choice do we have?

2:01:25.333 --> 2:01:27.708
They'll hang you for that one day.

2:01:32.666 --> 2:01:33.625
I know.

2:09:24.958 --> 2:09:29.958
