00:01.084 --> 00:03.461
NARRATOR:
<i>Previously on </i>Hill Street Blues...

00:03.545 --> 00:04.504
Name?

00:04.587 --> 00:08.717
(vocalizes fanfare) Captain Freedom!
(imitates explosion)

00:08.800 --> 00:12.762
When I walk, buildings shake
and bad guys wet their pants.

00:12.846 --> 00:15.974
-Where are the bad guys?
-They're in your head, playing canasta.

00:16.057 --> 00:18.643
We're gonna set-up a scam saloon
open at 30, Frank.

00:18.727 --> 00:20.395
Put out the bait for some payoffs.

00:20.478 --> 00:23.940
You got a red zone out front.
No place to park.

00:24.024 --> 00:26.693
Well, you know,
we're banking on a lot of foot traffic.

00:27.736 --> 00:30.739
I'm saying a hundred bucks a week'll make
your parking problem go away.

00:30.822 --> 00:32.699
Don't you wish to take
the fifth amendment, Captain?

00:32.782 --> 00:34.409
I'm guilty of nothing.

00:34.492 --> 00:38.538
The man's gotta find something to justify
that two million dollar commission of his.

00:38.621 --> 00:42.333
Well, there is the matter of, uh,
Art Delgado.

00:42.417 --> 00:44.085
Oh, my God, Delgado.

00:44.169 --> 00:46.421
Here I be. (laughs)

00:46.504 --> 00:48.673
-DAVENPORT:<i> Who's Art Delgado?</i>
-FRANK:<i> Burn-out case.</i>

00:48.757 --> 00:51.301
We've been keeping him on the roster
as a paper soldier.

00:51.384 --> 00:54.929
You know, signing him in and out
so he can retire with enough to live on.

00:55.013 --> 00:57.807
You're a beanbag.
Look at you. You're a banana pie.

00:57.891 --> 01:01.061
I want you out of my life.
I want you off this planet.

01:02.687 --> 01:06.441
(indistinct clamoring)

01:06.524 --> 01:07.650
-Here.
-What's this?

01:07.734 --> 01:09.069
-I'm on a liquid diet.
-Right on.

01:12.822 --> 01:13.656
People!

01:13.740 --> 01:17.744
-(talking stops)
-Operation Smash and Snatch.

01:18.536 --> 01:20.789
As most of you are no doubt aware,

01:20.872 --> 01:23.792
we've had a serious outbreak
of vehicular purse-snatching

01:24.375 --> 01:27.629
visited upon ladies driving
through the McKinley projects vicinity

01:27.712 --> 01:29.089
these past weeks.

01:29.798 --> 01:33.885
Uh, due to a shortage of female decoys,
the less hefty and bearded of you

01:34.469 --> 01:37.764
will find at your lockers
a, uh, varied selection

01:37.847 --> 01:40.683
of wigs, dresses and appropriate
foundation garments.

01:40.767 --> 01:42.268
(all laughing)

01:42.769 --> 01:45.688
Brady, Lyle, Allbright,
Knox, Peterson, LaRue.

01:45.772 --> 01:47.982
-What?
-Further details to be included

01:48.066 --> 01:50.193
in Lieutenant Calletano's briefing

01:50.276 --> 01:54.948
immediately following
your post-haste wardrobe change.

01:56.574 --> 02:00.328
Item ten is a, uh, precinct-wide memo

02:00.411 --> 02:04.207
from Captain Furillo
concerning entrapments.

02:06.376 --> 02:11.089
<i>-Messieurs et mam'selles--</i>
-(officers jeering)

02:11.172 --> 02:13.925
Having pounded some pavement
in my day, I can well understand

02:14.008 --> 02:18.763
a certain professional zeal, as it were,
vis-à-vis batting averages

02:18.847 --> 02:20.473
and the squad room arrest pool.

02:20.807 --> 02:25.061
ESTERHAUS: But, uh, let us be mindful
of the judicial climate out there.

02:25.979 --> 02:30.066
These collars don't do any of us any good
languishing in the DA's lame beef file.

02:30.150 --> 02:31.943
I would particularly recommend
this caution

02:32.026 --> 02:34.154
to a certain female vice officer

02:34.237 --> 02:36.698
seen loitering outside
the bus terminal men's room

02:36.781 --> 02:39.784
in a "Love me, I'm sick" t-shirt.

02:39.868 --> 02:41.744
(all laughing)

02:44.747 --> 02:48.042
Finally, for those of you
interested in the tenth annual

02:48.126 --> 02:50.962
inter-departmental
grand tourney poker finals,

02:51.379 --> 02:54.465
as of four o'clock this morning,
after 12 hours of spirited play

02:54.549 --> 02:59.053
at an unnamed downtown hotel,
the tally stands

02:59.304 --> 03:02.640
Midtown down 80, West Delavan up 60,

03:02.891 --> 03:05.185
-South Park down 20,
-Okay.

03:05.268 --> 03:08.271
-Hill street down 140.
-(people clamoring)

03:10.940 --> 03:13.818
Of course, a lot could change
in three and a half hours, people.

03:14.110 --> 03:16.070
Those of you desiring
more current standings

03:16.154 --> 03:20.742
may direct dial Klondike 5-4461.

03:22.535 --> 03:23.786
Hold it!

03:24.245 --> 03:26.623
Realizing full well
that many of you, as I,

03:26.706 --> 03:29.250
have a considerable monetary interest
in this competition,

03:29.667 --> 03:33.838
let us, nevertheless,
show a modicum of discretion

03:33.922 --> 03:37.967
and keep the precinct phones clear
for somewhat more

03:38.051 --> 03:41.262
sanctioned business, shall we?

03:42.347 --> 03:45.099
All right, that's it.
Let's roll. And, hey!

03:46.059 --> 03:47.977
Let's be careful out there.

03:48.061 --> 03:50.980
(all clamoring)

03:57.779 --> 04:00.823
RENKO: I'll get it now. I'll get it now.

04:01.616 --> 04:03.034
Get out of my way, hairballs.

04:03.117 --> 04:04.619
-Give me the phone.
-What?

04:04.702 --> 04:06.996
I got nearly a two percent interest
in this clambake.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.915
-What room are they in?
-406.

04:08.998 --> 04:10.250
Any of you girls wanna go out

04:10.333 --> 04:12.293
with a member
of the sanitation department?

04:12.377 --> 04:15.964
Belker, dog breath, what's this I hear
about us being 140 in the hole?

04:16.047 --> 04:17.423
COFFEY:
Hey, how many times you gonna call?

04:17.799 --> 04:20.176
-MAN: Wait a minute.
-COFFEY: Would you just relax, Mick?

04:20.260 --> 04:21.719
That was four hours ago.

04:22.470 --> 04:23.429
Take a guess.

04:23.972 --> 04:26.766
I don't guess.
Just give me the numbers, will ya?

04:26.849 --> 04:28.726
We're up 500.

04:33.147 --> 04:34.399
Read 'em and weep.

04:35.108 --> 04:37.694
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch, we have a 9-11.</i>

04:37.902 --> 04:39.570
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

04:39.654 --> 04:43.574
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

04:43.658 --> 04:45.285
(sirens wailing)

04:50.748 --> 04:52.000
(theme music playing)

05:50.099 --> 05:53.144
(people clamoring)

05:53.227 --> 05:55.188
GOLDBLUME: I realize a certain amount
of paper-shuffling

05:55.271 --> 05:58.441
comes with the territory, Frank,
but, I mean, there are computers downtown

05:58.524 --> 05:59.901
getting more job satisfaction than I am--

05:59.984 --> 06:01.819
Sounds as if this is
building to something, Henry.

06:01.903 --> 06:04.614
You know that smash and snatch operation
Ray's running today?

06:05.531 --> 06:07.283
Come on, Frank,
they can use an extra hand.

06:07.367 --> 06:08.701
Last time you went out undercover

06:08.785 --> 06:10.203
you ended up getting
booted out of the house

06:10.286 --> 06:12.246
and sleeping on my couch for three nights.

06:12.330 --> 06:13.706
Size 14, Henry.

06:14.582 --> 06:17.126
Don't worry, Frank.
I think my marriage is safe in this.

06:18.961 --> 06:20.213
CAPTAIN FREEDOM: This is it, son.

06:20.296 --> 06:23.716
Fear, loneliness, despair.

06:24.050 --> 06:27.261
Voices screaming in the night. Prison.

06:27.345 --> 06:30.014
Officer, I've got one for booking here.

06:30.473 --> 06:32.975
I hope the rats in the holding cells
have been fed today.

06:34.727 --> 06:37.063
Mick! Partner.<i> Qué pasa?</i>

06:37.355 --> 06:40.566
Didn't I tell you a thousand times
to stay out of here?

06:41.067 --> 06:42.318
What are you doing with him?

06:42.735 --> 06:45.196
I caught the young lad
spray-painting a school, Mick.

06:45.488 --> 06:47.782
I thought I'd bring him in,
give him the old scare treatment,

06:47.865 --> 06:49.200
and then kick him loose.

06:49.283 --> 06:51.244
-It seems to be working.
-Are you kidding?

06:51.327 --> 06:53.788
This dirtbag has 20 priors.
One for assault.

06:53.871 --> 06:56.124
People don't scare him. He scares people.

06:56.207 --> 06:58.126
My brother was a lot like that.

06:58.209 --> 07:01.421
We finally had to tie him down
and run an ocean through his head.

07:01.796 --> 07:02.880
He's better now.

07:03.381 --> 07:04.841
Can't you do anything right?

07:04.924 --> 07:07.593
What, did your mother throw your brains
out with the bath water?

07:07.927 --> 07:10.471
Keep talking, pig,
and get a shiv in your whitewalls.

07:10.555 --> 07:13.975
-The captain's my friend.
-I think I'm getting through to him, Mick.

07:14.058 --> 07:16.978
He's gonna take me
on a field trip to Venus.

07:17.061 --> 07:18.271
After Labor Day.

07:18.354 --> 07:21.858
-Look, Bobby, it's the ozone brothers.
-Oh.

07:23.818 --> 07:27.155
(Calletano speaking Spanish)

07:29.073 --> 07:31.576
Excuse me, Ray,
but unless you want to hear

07:31.659 --> 07:33.536
the most disgusting revelations

07:33.619 --> 07:36.622
about this man's off-duty persona,
I'd leave.

07:36.956 --> 07:38.458
Uh, I'll call you right back.

07:41.711 --> 07:43.254
Excuse me, Mrs. Furillo.

07:44.922 --> 07:50.052
I found this in Frank Jr.'s
tank toy commander set.

07:50.136 --> 07:53.139
According to him, it's a memento
from last weekend at your place.

07:53.222 --> 07:55.808
-Uh--
-What kind of a man

07:55.892 --> 07:59.729
invites his son over for the weekend
and then allows him to get a look

07:59.812 --> 08:01.522
at his father making love to his cookie?

08:01.606 --> 08:04.692
Nobody allowed anything.
He let himself into the apartment.

08:04.775 --> 08:06.611
With the key that you gave him?

08:06.694 --> 08:09.030
Well, if you hadn't brought him
by an hour and a half

08:09.113 --> 08:09.947
before you said you would,

08:10.031 --> 08:11.991
he wouldn't have seen anything
in the first place.

08:12.074 --> 08:14.619
These things happen all the time.
It's no big deal.

08:14.702 --> 08:18.498
I think we're talking
irreversible trauma, Frank.

08:18.581 --> 08:20.583
(chuckles)

08:20.666 --> 08:23.794
Well, I fail to see
what's so funny, Mister.

08:23.878 --> 08:25.963
Oh, I'm... I'm sorry.
I'm not laughing at you.

08:26.464 --> 08:29.342
(stuttering) It's just... it's good to see
you're finally getting over Hal's death.

08:29.425 --> 08:31.052
Don't change the subject.

08:31.385 --> 08:35.181
We're talking about your son's emotional
well-being here, not mine.

08:35.264 --> 08:38.851
Look, if you don't make a big deal
out of it, it'll just go away.

08:38.935 --> 08:41.020
Oh, sure.

08:41.103 --> 08:46.025
So what if he becomes
just one more self-centered male

08:46.108 --> 08:48.819
who think women exist
for just one purpose.

08:49.779 --> 08:51.113
(sighs)

08:58.371 --> 09:00.748
I bet she hasn't even missed it!

09:04.835 --> 09:08.464
Remember, you are the hope of America.

09:09.924 --> 09:12.176
In your hands resides the power

09:12.260 --> 09:15.513
that will ultimately lift
humankind to the stars.

09:15.596 --> 09:17.306
(both imitate explosion)

09:17.390 --> 09:20.017
-Excuse me.
-It's you!

09:21.227 --> 09:24.313
4000 B.C. The Princess Zuma,

09:24.397 --> 09:27.567
daughter of Pharaoh Amenhotep,
whose likeness graces the wall

09:27.650 --> 09:29.402
of the Great Temple at Amon.

09:29.902 --> 09:31.487
-Excuse me--
-The lips, the eyes,

09:31.571 --> 09:33.322
the regal slope of the nose,

09:33.406 --> 09:37.410
the sheer, overwhelming
majesty of your beauty.

09:37.493 --> 09:38.703
They taunted you.

09:39.036 --> 09:42.123
A woman of uncommon intelligence.
A free spirit.

09:42.498 --> 09:44.917
They did not understand your sensitivity

09:45.001 --> 09:47.336
or the fiery compassion
that raged within you.

09:47.420 --> 09:50.506
You vowed that you would return,

09:50.590 --> 09:53.426
and now you're back,
oh princess of the Nile!

09:54.927 --> 09:59.432
Um, could you let go of my hands?
I think you have the wrong person.

10:03.769 --> 10:04.979
You're right.

10:06.105 --> 10:07.523
The light's bad in here.

10:08.399 --> 10:09.358
My mistake.

10:19.035 --> 10:21.829
Ray, I have to grab a couple of your men.

10:21.912 --> 10:23.331
Frank, I'm already shorthanded as it is.

10:23.414 --> 10:25.791
What can I tell you? LaRue and Washington.

10:26.292 --> 10:29.670
Got a prescription fraud call
about 20 minutes ago.

10:30.046 --> 10:32.048
X-cel pharmacy down on Elmwood and North.

10:32.340 --> 10:34.091
-Sorry, Ray.
-Oh, God.

10:34.175 --> 10:36.802
Captain, thanks a million.
Thanks a million.

10:36.886 --> 10:38.554
(sighs) Okay.

10:42.433 --> 10:43.392
ART: Frank?

10:44.852 --> 10:47.730
-Can I talk to you for a minute?
-Sure, Art, come on in.

10:48.105 --> 10:50.650
-I know how busy you are.
-No, it's okay.

10:52.860 --> 10:55.363
I want you to know that I appreciate
what you're doing for me,

10:55.905 --> 10:58.032
but I don't see you taking the heat for me

10:58.115 --> 10:59.283
from the Sullivan commission.

10:59.367 --> 11:02.620
There's no heat, Art. Their investigation
has nothing to do with you.

11:03.537 --> 11:05.456
I wish I could believe that, Frank.

11:10.127 --> 11:12.129
I was subpoenaed two hours ago.

11:14.382 --> 11:15.841
When do they want you?

11:16.425 --> 11:18.594
Friday, at 3:00.

11:20.554 --> 11:22.348
I'm not ready for this.

11:23.891 --> 11:28.229
Frank, I can't sit in a room with three
or four people without getting the shakes.

11:29.063 --> 11:31.524
I'll lose it in front of the grand jury.

11:33.401 --> 11:35.277
Take it easy. Just try not to worry.

11:37.780 --> 11:39.407
You have a seat. I'll be right back.

11:45.454 --> 11:48.249
Other than stonewalling,
which I doubt he's capable of,

11:48.332 --> 11:50.459
Delgado's got two choices, Frank.

11:51.293 --> 11:54.255
He can either refuse to appear,
in which case he'll be held in contempt,

11:54.338 --> 11:57.425
or he can plead delay of appearance
on account of medical grounds.

11:57.508 --> 11:59.343
That wouldn't be too far from the truth.

11:59.844 --> 12:02.555
After 19 years on the Hill,
the man's a walking breakdown.

12:03.097 --> 12:06.267
I'd call his doctor as soon as possible
and have your man admitted to county

12:06.350 --> 12:08.227
for observation for a week or two.

12:08.477 --> 12:10.521
Sullivan ought
to be out of business by then.

12:11.897 --> 12:12.857
I owe you one.

12:14.442 --> 12:16.527
In that case,
I'll let you treat me to a hot lunch

12:16.610 --> 12:18.946
before you tangle
with that jury this afternoon.

12:19.029 --> 12:19.989
Just say when.

12:20.656 --> 12:23.492
They have a lovely dining room
at the Hotel Francçoise.

12:24.201 --> 12:25.369
Say, one o'clock?

12:28.581 --> 12:33.002
Oh. I just thought you'd like to know,
Francis, we're up 1,250.

12:34.211 --> 12:35.838
Refresh my memory, Phil.

12:36.130 --> 12:39.091
Well, the tenth annual
inter-departmental poker finals.

12:39.341 --> 12:42.928
Phil, in case you've forgotten,
this entire precinct is up to its ears

12:43.012 --> 12:44.680
in a grand jury investigation.

12:44.764 --> 12:47.808
In deference to which, I've asked the men
to move it out of the station this year

12:47.892 --> 12:50.603
-to a hotel over on--
-Don't tell me. I don't want to know.

12:53.105 --> 12:56.567
-Who's playing for our side?
-Bates. Lucy bates.

12:57.818 --> 12:58.986
(chuckles)

13:01.405 --> 13:02.948
-Bates?
-Uh-huh.

13:03.324 --> 13:07.369
-Judas H. Priest.
<i>-Oh, non, non, non, mon ami.</i>

13:07.453 --> 13:11.248
<i>Cette femme est une "gambler" formidable.</i>

13:21.675 --> 13:23.761
(typewriter keys clacking)

13:26.764 --> 13:28.432
Doggone it, Webster!

13:29.308 --> 13:32.311
I know morphine addicts that can type
faster than that. Move over.

13:45.074 --> 13:49.286
-(bell rings)
-Now, you see? Two hands, Webster.

13:49.370 --> 13:54.542
Ten fingers. Rhythm, focus, dexterity.

14:02.716 --> 14:04.552
(sirens wailing)

14:08.013 --> 14:09.723
Right, I'll have it ready for you.

14:11.559 --> 14:15.354
Hey, LaRue, he just called.
He'll be a little late.

14:16.355 --> 14:19.733
You guys see anything you want,
police discount's 20 percent.

14:20.276 --> 14:21.402
No kidding?

14:22.278 --> 14:24.363
(whistling)

14:26.615 --> 14:31.245
(chuckles) Let me tell you
about the smells women love, Neal.

14:31.328 --> 14:32.538
You see this stuff here?

14:33.414 --> 14:36.292
This is a little-known,
but highly effective product

14:36.375 --> 14:38.752
that simulates the scent
of a male's sweat.

14:38.836 --> 14:40.921
And I always thought you
smelled that way naturally.

14:41.505 --> 14:44.466
You think I'm jiving. Women go crazy.

14:45.593 --> 14:47.553
Hey. Watch.

14:55.019 --> 14:56.478
(clears throat) Uh, excuse me.

14:57.688 --> 15:02.234
Miss, my partner and I
are police officers, and I was just--

15:02.318 --> 15:06.030
Oh, please don't arrest me.
I'm seeing a psychiatrist.

15:07.531 --> 15:10.159
I can't help myself. Look, I'll just--

15:10.576 --> 15:13.537
I'll just put everything back.

15:18.167 --> 15:21.837
-(chuckles)
-And I won't do it again, I swear.

15:34.767 --> 15:37.478
-Sir?
-I'm looking for Ms. Davenport.

15:37.561 --> 15:40.189
Oh, Captain Furillo,
Ms. Davenport can't make lunch today,

15:40.272 --> 15:42.274
but she wanted me to give you this note.

15:45.819 --> 15:47.404
(sighs)

15:53.160 --> 15:54.453
(groans)

15:55.454 --> 15:58.707
You sure have a great way
of preparing your clients

15:58.791 --> 16:01.001
for their court appearances, counselor.

16:03.128 --> 16:05.172
I thought you needed to relax a little.

16:06.256 --> 16:08.175
-DAVENPORT: Hungry?
-No.

16:08.842 --> 16:11.971
You want to keep your strength up. Eat.

16:13.889 --> 16:15.683
(laughs)

16:16.225 --> 16:19.395
You know, the Sullivan commission
can't do a thing to you.

16:19.478 --> 16:20.938
-Now, listen to me.
-All right.

16:21.021 --> 16:23.232
They can't arrest you,
or charge you or discipline you.

16:23.315 --> 16:26.568
All they can do is recommend.
So what's really bothering you?

16:26.652 --> 16:30.239
Oh, they're so damn sanctimonious,
sitting up there in the state capital

16:31.323 --> 16:33.617
buying three-martini lunches
with my tax dollars

16:33.701 --> 16:35.369
and telling me about corruption.

16:35.452 --> 16:37.496
They haven't a clue
how tough it is down here.

16:37.579 --> 16:38.497
Mm.

16:39.498 --> 16:41.875
Sorry, no sale. Try again.

16:43.836 --> 16:45.587
FRANK: You're so smug, you tell me.

16:46.839 --> 16:49.758
You're afraid that after
16 years of being Mr. Perfect,

16:50.467 --> 16:53.637
they'll all suddenly think
you're just another crooked cop.

16:54.096 --> 16:56.849
FRANK: I just don't want to be known
as another George Haluska.

16:56.932 --> 16:58.392
What's so terrible about that?

16:59.184 --> 17:00.185
You tell me.

17:00.602 --> 17:03.439
Is he a lousy cop?
Does he run a lousy precinct?

17:03.522 --> 17:06.191
Is the crime in South Ferry
worse than it is on the Hill?

17:06.275 --> 17:09.194
-His cops are on the take.
-And none of yours are.

17:09.278 --> 17:12.156
Not to my knowledge.
And certainly not with my blessing.

17:12.239 --> 17:14.158
You can't work in garbage for 20 years

17:14.241 --> 17:16.410
without occasionally getting
your hands dirty.

17:16.493 --> 17:17.828
My hands aren't dirty.

17:17.911 --> 17:22.082
Isn't it true that you are knowingly
falsifying arrest records,

17:22.166 --> 17:26.754
duty rosters and pay vouchers
for officer Arthur Delgado?

17:26.837 --> 17:27.838
Oh, come on.

17:28.839 --> 17:32.301
The man's a walking casualty.
You'd do the same under the circumstances.

17:33.010 --> 17:34.136
I'm not so sure.

17:35.554 --> 17:36.930
And what really troubles me

17:37.014 --> 17:39.725
is your belief that you somehow
have a right to function

17:39.808 --> 17:41.185
under a different set of rules,

17:41.268 --> 17:44.021
because you have an absolute corner
on the morality market.

17:45.522 --> 17:49.234
A dangerous assumption,
Furillo, sanctimonious-wise.

17:52.362 --> 17:53.947
(sighs)

17:58.202 --> 17:59.286
All right.

18:00.287 --> 18:02.664
What's your best legal advice, counselor?

18:04.041 --> 18:07.086
I'd go in there loaded with as much
information as I could muster.

18:07.795 --> 18:09.379
Tell them about Art Delgado.

18:10.547 --> 18:13.634
Tell them about the building
and code inspectors in South Ferry.

18:14.843 --> 18:17.262
And if you have to,
give them George Haluska.

18:17.346 --> 18:19.389
Because if you don't, Chief Daniels will.

18:19.807 --> 18:22.101
-You're tough.
-Mm-hmm.

18:23.102 --> 18:25.813
-But you give good succor.
-Watch it.

18:30.776 --> 18:32.319
Do you have to be back right away?

18:33.570 --> 18:36.824
-Why, what do you have in mind?
_Aid of another type.

18:41.620 --> 18:43.122
(car horns honking)

18:47.751 --> 18:51.421
RENKO: So I'll have two breast of chicken,
two salad plates,

18:51.505 --> 18:55.217
two orders of ice cream,
two more beers and some potato chips.

18:55.300 --> 18:57.302
Yes, sir.
Mick, couple of beers. Couple of beers.

18:57.386 --> 18:59.304
BELKER: Couple of beers, two burgers--

18:59.388 --> 19:00.597
How we doing on that poker game?

19:00.681 --> 19:02.975
Going good. Last time I heard,
we were up nearly a grand.

19:03.058 --> 19:04.393
-All right.
-Yeah!

19:06.770 --> 19:08.105
-You work here?
-Yeah.

19:08.689 --> 19:12.109
-Dunello, health inspector.
-Back there.

19:12.734 --> 19:13.735
Thank you.

19:15.821 --> 19:18.907
We got an insect infestation
inspection in progress.

19:18.991 --> 19:20.826
-Yeah, right. Got it.
-(door slams)

19:22.119 --> 19:23.871
Sir, things like that,
you have to make some--

19:23.954 --> 19:26.081
DUNELLO: You got a hell
of a business here, kid.

19:26.165 --> 19:28.500
I was in your lavatory. It's a mess.

19:28.584 --> 19:31.420
Among other things, you don't have
your regulation health department sign,

19:31.503 --> 19:34.756
requiring your employees to wash
their hands, which is no big surprise,

19:34.840 --> 19:36.592
because you also got no running water.

19:36.675 --> 19:39.553
RENKO: Well, you know the pipes burst
in this place last night, so--

19:39.636 --> 19:40.762
DUNELLO: What are they...
what are they supposed to do,

19:40.846 --> 19:42.097
wash up in the toilet?

19:42.264 --> 19:45.726
Also, you got signs of marginal
infestation all over the place.

19:46.393 --> 19:49.271
I really ought to shut you down.
Hey, look at that.

19:49.688 --> 19:51.815
-What?
-Roaches. Right above your griddle. There!

19:59.865 --> 20:01.992
Now, listen to me. I need to know how much

20:02.075 --> 20:03.911
it's gonna cost us
to keep this place open.

20:03.994 --> 20:07.372
Well, we're looking at a hundred today,
with a regular inspection every Tuesday.

20:08.415 --> 20:12.002
RENKO: I can't pay that.
Look at my help. I can't pay that!

20:23.263 --> 20:24.640
(car horn honking)

20:47.371 --> 20:49.873
-Hold it!
-(grunts)

20:52.542 --> 20:53.543
Hold it!

20:55.879 --> 20:57.756
-(grunting)
-(groaning)

21:05.722 --> 21:06.890
(screams)

21:07.599 --> 21:09.685
Help me! I'm a police officer!

21:29.621 --> 21:30.580
All right, you--

22:07.617 --> 22:09.661
-How ya doing?
-Fine.

22:10.370 --> 22:11.913
Got the prescription? I called.

22:12.331 --> 22:14.207
MAN: (sighs) Coming right up.

22:15.083 --> 22:18.211
-14.63's the damage.
-Twenty?

22:19.212 --> 22:21.381
(cash register clicks, rings)

22:21.465 --> 22:23.467
-CUSTOMER: Thanks. Take care now.
-You too.

22:42.194 --> 22:43.028
Hey, yo!

22:44.112 --> 22:46.073
Hey, hold it right there, my man.
Police officers.

22:46.156 --> 22:48.075
You're under arrest.
You have the right to remain silent.

22:48.158 --> 22:50.869
-If you give up the right--
-What's goin' on here? I'm a cop!

22:51.953 --> 22:55.499
All right, I'm gonna go into my pocket
very slowly, get my I.D.

22:55.582 --> 22:56.666
Nothing more. Okay?

23:00.629 --> 23:04.007
I'm on special investigation
out of midtown, under Captain Jerry Fuchs.

23:04.091 --> 23:07.928
We're investigating druggists who fill out
a prescription scribbled on toilet paper.

23:08.011 --> 23:10.806
Now, this guy in here just sold me
200 amphetamine pills

23:10.889 --> 23:13.683
written on a prescription pad
we got out of the evidence bin.

23:13.767 --> 23:15.727
The doctor has been dead for six months.

23:15.811 --> 23:18.730
(chuckles) Figures.
The guy there called us about you.

23:18.814 --> 23:20.816
Said it was your third prescription
this month.

23:20.899 --> 23:22.109
That's funny.

23:22.192 --> 23:24.111
I guess I can scratch him off my list,
huh?

23:24.694 --> 23:26.863
We're doing about 20 pharmacies.

23:27.280 --> 23:29.616
-Who's your lieutenant?
-Moe Jacobs. You know him?

23:29.699 --> 23:31.827
Yeah. Good guy.

23:31.910 --> 23:33.745
So why don't you check it out
with him, if you want?

23:33.829 --> 23:36.581
No. That's cool.
What we got here is a classic case

23:36.665 --> 23:39.292
of the left hand not knowing
what the right one's doing.

23:39.376 --> 23:40.377
COP: Typical.

23:40.460 --> 23:43.213
-Well, look, if you guys don't mind--
-Hey. Hey, look.

23:43.755 --> 23:46.258
-Sorry we jumped you, huh?
-Forget it.

24:00.897 --> 24:03.358
Henry, did you get hit by a truck?

24:04.860 --> 24:06.111
I'm telling you, Phil.

24:07.279 --> 24:10.449
You like to think your fellow man
shares your regard for human life.

24:10.532 --> 24:14.619
But then you get involved in a brawl
out there, in broad daylight,

24:14.703 --> 24:17.372
where you're literally fighting
for your life, and what happens?

24:17.456 --> 24:18.582
No one helps you.

24:19.374 --> 24:21.668
I'm dressed like a woman,
no one lifts a finger.

24:22.085 --> 24:25.005
I I.D.'d myself as a police officer,
no one helps.

24:26.506 --> 24:28.467
What kind of a world
are we living in, Phil?

24:29.009 --> 24:31.219
It's a sad commentary. No doubt about it.

24:31.303 --> 24:33.138
Phil, would you book this piece
of dirt for me?

24:33.221 --> 24:34.097
Oh, good idea.

24:34.181 --> 24:36.183
Hey, why don't you get yourself
cleaned up?

24:36.266 --> 24:38.226
I'll get somebody to take you
to emergency.

24:38.310 --> 24:40.145
I'll clean the blood.
I'm gonna get a cup of coffee.

24:45.150 --> 24:46.318
FRANK: Henry.

24:49.446 --> 24:53.450
-Are you all right?
-I'm fine, Frank. In fact, I'm damn fine.

24:54.034 --> 24:56.703
I don't think of myself as a violent man,
but it sure is nice to know

24:56.786 --> 24:58.705
I can still go ten rounds when I have to.

24:58.788 --> 25:01.833
Well, I suggest you climb out
of that dress, Sugar Ray,

25:01.917 --> 25:03.210
and get yourself over to county general.

25:03.293 --> 25:05.378
-You need stitches.
-Not to worry, Frank.

25:06.213 --> 25:08.548
Boy, do I feel pumped.

25:09.466 --> 25:10.634
Joe Coffey there?

25:10.717 --> 25:12.636
(low chattering)

25:15.472 --> 25:16.640
Yeah, Coffey here. What?

25:17.015 --> 25:18.058
How's it going, man?

25:18.141 --> 25:20.977
She's got kings full over nines.
I gotta go.

25:21.478 --> 25:22.395
WASHINGTON: I don't know.

25:22.479 --> 25:24.773
He said it's been going on for two months,
or something.

25:26.066 --> 25:27.067
Sure about that?

25:28.527 --> 25:30.362
Okay, thanks, babe. Appreciate it.

25:32.822 --> 25:34.324
-(sighs)
-What?

25:34.866 --> 25:37.077
Narcotics ain't running
nothing on druggists.

25:37.452 --> 25:39.371
Cleary's supposed to be on harbor patrol.

25:42.958 --> 25:45.877
I don't like it, man.
Maybe we shouldn't get involved.

25:45.961 --> 25:47.045
What do you say?

25:47.837 --> 25:49.381
I think we got to, babe.

25:51.299 --> 25:55.011
Maybe he's selling, maybe he's using.
Either way, the prescriptions are forged.

25:55.095 --> 25:58.265
Maybe if I talked to him, Captain.
I've been there.

25:58.348 --> 26:00.809
If he were one of our own, J.D., maybe.
But he's not.

26:00.892 --> 26:02.519
-Bring him in.
-Right, Captain.

26:03.061 --> 26:04.271
Come on, lover, let's go.

26:06.147 --> 26:06.982
MAN: I've had it.

26:07.065 --> 26:09.442
MAN 2:
You can finish this hand without me.

26:10.902 --> 26:13.113
Come on, Brebey, what are you gonna do?
You gonna call, or what?

26:13.196 --> 26:15.907
-I'm thinking.
-Yeah, well, I'd like to go home sometime.

26:16.157 --> 26:18.493
So go. Who says she needs Angelo Dundee?

26:20.453 --> 26:25.417
All right. I guess I'll call and, uh...

26:27.711 --> 26:28.837
Tell you what--

26:29.504 --> 26:31.131
(money rustling)

26:31.798 --> 26:35.510
Let's throw in another 500,
just to make it interesting.

26:35.927 --> 26:38.888
-What?
-That's why they call it "guts," blondie.

26:40.390 --> 26:41.641
Call or fold.

26:44.394 --> 26:45.645
He's bluffing.

26:52.444 --> 26:54.112
Call. Let's see 'em.

26:57.365 --> 27:00.243
-MAN: Unbelievable.
-(groaning)

27:00.327 --> 27:01.911
Four deuces.

27:03.163 --> 27:05.040
(sighs) I can't believe it.

27:05.373 --> 27:06.791
I'm gonna be sick.

27:07.792 --> 27:09.002
You're good, kid.

27:10.503 --> 27:11.713
But I'm better.

27:16.509 --> 27:18.386
-MAN: Eddy, need a ride?
-EDDY: Yeah. Yeah.

27:18.887 --> 27:20.639
GREBEY: Let's go. Lunch is on me.

27:20.722 --> 27:22.724
-(chattering)
-(sighs deeply)

27:26.186 --> 27:28.271
-How'd we make out?
-(door closes)

27:29.022 --> 27:32.484
-We won two bucks.
-Two bucks?

27:34.819 --> 27:36.613
What's that, about six cents an hour?

27:38.740 --> 27:42.160
A $2,000 turnaround in one pot.

27:44.079 --> 27:45.747
I don't believe it.

27:54.881 --> 27:56.174
(sighs, groans)

28:04.265 --> 28:05.809
Well, at least you didn't lose.

28:07.644 --> 28:09.062
My back's killing me.

28:11.523 --> 28:13.233
(sighs)

28:22.867 --> 28:25.370
(groans) We gotta get out of here.

28:25.453 --> 28:28.331
Hey, just relax.
We can hang out here for a while.

28:28.415 --> 28:30.417
The room's paid for till tonight.

28:34.796 --> 28:37.424
-Hey, let me under here.
-Joe.

28:37.507 --> 28:41.928
Hey, relax. You can't give
a good massage over material.

28:42.679 --> 28:44.514
-I'm the trainer.
-Mm-hmm.

28:49.811 --> 28:53.523
Oh, I gotta lay down. Oh, I'm so tired.

28:54.816 --> 28:58.111
As long as we got the room, right? Okay?

29:08.163 --> 29:09.122
Joe.

29:10.623 --> 29:15.253
Hey. Come on. We're-- we're both keyed up.
You're all keyed up.

29:24.137 --> 29:25.513
Joe, don't.

29:36.775 --> 29:37.817
No.

29:51.831 --> 29:56.044
I started night law school in September,
so, uh, by Christmas,

29:56.127 --> 29:58.505
I don't know, everything,
I was sort of backed up.

29:58.588 --> 30:00.215
Things were going bad, so...

30:02.008 --> 30:04.511
it just seemed like the easiest,

30:05.428 --> 30:08.014
the most harmless thing to do
would be to get a few pills.

30:09.557 --> 30:10.767
A few more pills.

30:15.230 --> 30:16.356
Hey, I never dealt.

30:17.857 --> 30:19.067
I got a problem.

30:19.984 --> 30:22.487
Uh, maybe I'm a disgrace.
I don't know about that.

30:23.321 --> 30:26.241
-But I never dealt.
-Where'd you get the forms, Dan?

30:26.950 --> 30:30.161
Uh, evidence file
on a doctor's office burglary.

30:30.620 --> 30:31.830
Case was closed.

30:34.040 --> 30:36.626
Step outside for a minute? Please.

30:44.467 --> 30:46.386
(exhales)

30:46.469 --> 30:48.346
FRANK: So what's it gonna be
with this guy?

30:50.223 --> 30:52.892
It's none of my business,
and you're his commanding officer, Jerry,

30:52.976 --> 30:54.519
but I think he's salvageable.

30:54.602 --> 30:55.854
He's what?

30:58.481 --> 31:01.901
I've seen too much unnecessary wreckage
in this department lately.

31:02.777 --> 31:06.322
(chuckling)
Come on, Frank, listen to yourself.

31:06.406 --> 31:09.284
The guy's a loser. He's a liability.

31:09.784 --> 31:12.328
Give him 90 days
for an inpatient at Hilltop,

31:12.412 --> 31:14.372
and we might still have a good cop.

31:15.206 --> 31:18.793
But if you cut him loose, we're just gonna
have another empty space in the line.

31:18.877 --> 31:20.545
Since when are we the judges?

31:21.004 --> 31:24.549
You went to the wall for Charlie Weeks and
he makes this guy look like Joan of Arc.

31:24.632 --> 31:27.093
That was then, Frank. Now's now.

31:28.136 --> 31:30.179
You should know
that better than anybody else.

31:30.263 --> 31:33.808
What makes him so different from all the
guys at the ferry that we're busting down?

31:34.309 --> 31:36.227
He's different, Jerry, and you know it.

31:36.311 --> 31:39.022
This isn't corruption,
this is a young guy with a problem.

31:40.773 --> 31:42.150
I'm no hero, Frank.

31:43.818 --> 31:47.780
I have no itch to sit
in Sullivan's witness chair.

31:58.750 --> 32:00.293
Let me have your gun and your badge.

32:06.633 --> 32:09.218
COFFEY: It's the last hand of the night.
We're up a grand, easy.

32:09.302 --> 32:12.096
Everybody's droppin' out, and then that
bozo from the heights, what a weasel.

32:12.180 --> 32:14.641
-Sorry about that, pal.
-She had kings full.

32:14.724 --> 32:19.020
Wired all the way.
She bets 500, he raises her,

32:19.103 --> 32:21.314
and then turns over four deuces.

32:21.397 --> 32:24.943
(sighs) Such are the vicissitudes
of fortune, Bates.

32:28.029 --> 32:29.280
Hey, look at it this way.

32:29.364 --> 32:32.367
You spent 30 hours
in a hotel room with six guys.

32:32.450 --> 32:34.202
And you averaged six cents an hour.

32:34.994 --> 32:36.120
(chuckles)

32:37.914 --> 32:39.958
Hey, don't let it bother you so much.

32:40.375 --> 32:43.002
That's not what's bothering me,
and you know it.

32:50.551 --> 32:53.763
Come on, Luce, you were... you were lying
there on your stomach.

32:54.472 --> 32:57.600
Since when don't I have the right
to lie down on my stomach

32:57.684 --> 33:00.019
after playing poker for 30 hours straight?

33:00.979 --> 33:03.523
Well, since when don't I have the right
to give you a back massage?

33:03.606 --> 33:05.191
(stammers) You said your back hurt.

33:05.483 --> 33:08.653
Joe, don't talk like an infant.
You were kissing me.

33:10.863 --> 33:13.992
Well, I'm attracted to you.
I mean, is that a crime?

33:14.826 --> 33:18.079
You were coming on to me, just like you do
with every other woman you meet.

33:18.162 --> 33:21.332
Yeah, well, I didn't see you offering
a whole lot of resistance.

33:24.711 --> 33:28.923
I just don't ever wanna hear this coming
back to me from any of the guys.

33:29.841 --> 33:31.092
Well, who do you think I am?

33:34.137 --> 33:35.471
I wouldn't do that.

33:37.348 --> 33:38.391
Sorry.

33:41.728 --> 33:43.896
I just feel so exposed sometimes, I...

33:44.689 --> 33:46.399
Like, if I make one mistake...

33:47.275 --> 33:49.736
You know what I mean? (sighing)

33:51.029 --> 33:53.489
Well, do you know how
I feel about you? Really?

33:55.408 --> 33:58.494
The last thing in the world I'd ever want
to see is you get hurt.

33:59.787 --> 34:01.122
I wanna look out for you.

34:02.790 --> 34:03.833
Yeah.

34:06.544 --> 34:07.670
Funny.

34:10.256 --> 34:14.218
You know, sometimes I feel
the same way about you.

34:21.267 --> 34:23.519
And you were great in my corner.

34:35.948 --> 34:40.620
And, would it be a fair deduction,
based on your prior testimony,

34:40.703 --> 34:42.997
that you run a fairly tight ship
on the Hill,

34:43.081 --> 34:44.957
that you keep abreast of events?

34:45.792 --> 34:47.418
We try to. Yes.

34:48.461 --> 34:49.462
Good.

34:50.254 --> 34:51.339
Ms. Jackson.

34:56.135 --> 34:58.304
Would you explain
to the jury what this is?

35:00.348 --> 35:05.019
It appears to be a standard .38 caliber
S &amp; W service revolver.

35:05.103 --> 35:06.187
Yes, indeed, it is.

35:06.521 --> 35:10.441
One seized with two auto theft suspects
this morning in Claremont.

35:10.733 --> 35:14.362
Unreported as missing on
any departmental records.

35:14.445 --> 35:17.865
And registered to one Andrew J. Renko.

35:19.784 --> 35:23.496
-Who is Andrew J. Renko, Captain?
-He's an officer in my precinct.

35:23.579 --> 35:26.082
Officers lose weapons from time to time.
There's no crime in that.

35:26.165 --> 35:30.795
Now, if this isn't an example of gross
administrative laxity, Captain, what is?

35:31.420 --> 35:35.341
Thousands of taxpayers' dollars are being
flushed down the Hill Street toilet,

35:35.424 --> 35:39.637
and not just in bizarre incidents
like this unaccountably lost firearm.

35:40.513 --> 35:45.017
Isn't it true, Captain Furillo,
that the abuse is so widespread,

35:45.434 --> 35:48.479
your chief has sent a spy
into your midst to uncover it?

35:48.980 --> 35:51.482
That spy, Mr. Peck, simply illustrates

35:51.566 --> 35:54.986
that my department does a fairly good job
of policing itself.

35:56.988 --> 36:01.033
Yes. We'll find out just how good a job
when your Chief Daniels

36:01.117 --> 36:06.497
shows up right after you to discuss
his celebrated "scam saloon."

36:07.540 --> 36:10.668
Now, moving on to another shining example,
the Hill Street postage meter.

36:10.751 --> 36:14.463
Oh, come on, Mr. Peck,
surely this $2 million commission

36:14.547 --> 36:17.383
hasn't been reduced
to counting paper clips?

36:17.466 --> 36:19.635
Why don't you put up or shut up?

36:20.094 --> 36:22.096
(jurors murmuring)

36:23.681 --> 36:28.519
-All right. Art Delgado.
-At last.

36:29.020 --> 36:31.898
Now, this jury has already heard testimony

36:31.981 --> 36:36.611
as to the organized system by which
Officer Delgado received pay

36:36.694 --> 36:39.197
for no work whatsoever.

36:39.822 --> 36:43.534
Last time, when you asked me
about "serious wrongdoings,"

36:43.618 --> 36:45.745
the name Art Delgado
didn't even occur to me.

36:46.871 --> 36:50.249
I wonder, Mr. Peck, have you told
your jurors anything about Art Delgado?

36:50.333 --> 36:51.876
You mean about his no-shows?

36:51.959 --> 36:55.338
About his manifest unfitness
for police work?

36:55.421 --> 36:59.091
Officer Delgado has served this city
for more than 29 years.

37:00.051 --> 37:02.053
After nine years of service,

37:03.012 --> 37:06.807
he lost all seniority because he took
a year's leave of absence.

37:08.351 --> 37:11.854
Today, he's still six months shy
of a 20-year pension.

37:11.938 --> 37:17.443
If you pull the string on him now, he gets
40 percent of a 15-year disability.

37:17.526 --> 37:21.030
I respectfully submit,
you can't even feed a dog on that.

37:21.447 --> 37:25.117
I've brought along a summary
of Officer Delgado's service record:

37:26.160 --> 37:27.286
four medals of valor,

37:27.370 --> 37:30.790
five humanitarian citations,
three shoot-outs.

37:32.208 --> 37:35.544
Are we now simply
to discard Officer Delgado?

37:36.087 --> 37:38.923
Yes, we've been carrying him
until his retirement.

37:39.006 --> 37:42.218
I would feel only shame
if we'd done any less.

37:42.301 --> 37:44.011
Take care to what
you're confessing to, Captain.

37:44.095 --> 37:46.889
Then along comes this commission,

37:46.973 --> 37:50.226
with cynicism and a hunger for headlines.

37:51.978 --> 37:55.523
Whatever we did for Art Delgado,
I take responsibility.

37:55.606 --> 37:57.817
Why don't you prosecute me?
Smear me in the press?

37:57.900 --> 38:02.655
Destroy my reputation, if you can.
But I'll not sell out Art Delgado.

38:03.281 --> 38:04.490
I'll not.

38:08.536 --> 38:10.746
Now, am I dismissed, Mr. Peck?

38:11.872 --> 38:13.332
No further questions.

38:17.086 --> 38:18.087
Captain...

38:19.422 --> 38:21.590
you should know that it has been
determined to remand you

38:21.674 --> 38:24.385
into the custody of your commanding
officer for discipline.

38:25.136 --> 38:28.514
Under the circumstances,
consider it a slap on the wrist.

38:33.519 --> 38:35.813
Well, Frank, how did it go?

38:36.022 --> 38:37.898
I'm remanded to you for a slap
on the wrist.

38:37.982 --> 38:39.233
Consider yourself slapped.

38:39.317 --> 38:41.193
It won't work,
it's gone too far. They're yours.

38:41.694 --> 38:43.654
Come on, Frank.
What are you doing? Cool down.

38:43.738 --> 38:47.992
Cool down? You set me up!
You put me in the jackpot. You used me!

38:48.075 --> 38:51.037
Of course I did. So what?
I'm the chief and you're the captain.

38:52.455 --> 38:54.832
Frank, why are you always
quitting on me, huh?

38:54.915 --> 38:57.084
What is it,
the Italian grand opera streak?

38:57.168 --> 39:00.880
Come on, Frank, I can't go into the jury
carrying an extra badge and gun.

39:01.255 --> 39:02.590
What about Art Delgado?

39:04.091 --> 39:07.053
All right, what about him?

39:07.136 --> 39:10.097
-I want assurances he'll be taken care of.
-No problem at all, Frank.

39:10.181 --> 39:12.850
I have friends over at Paramount security.
We'll send him right over there.

39:12.933 --> 39:15.978
That's not good enough.
Paramount security is not good enough.

39:16.937 --> 39:19.231
And let's face it,
Art Delgado's not good enough.

39:20.149 --> 39:22.985
He couldn't separate paper clips
at Paramount security anymore.

39:23.778 --> 39:26.614
-For God's sake, what then?
-He stays on the force.

39:27.365 --> 39:31.285
His year's leave is recredited so he gets
a 30-year retirement instead of a 20.

39:31.369 --> 39:33.579
Frank, I'd have to go
to the City Council on that.

39:33.662 --> 39:35.081
Then go.

39:35.164 --> 39:37.666
And I also want him given
a complete medical shield

39:37.750 --> 39:39.043
against those vultures in there.

39:39.126 --> 39:41.379
Frank, give me a break. The timing's not
right on that, and you know it!

39:41.462 --> 39:44.465
It never is. Within the month.

39:45.341 --> 39:48.844
Or you can go into that jury and brag
about how you bagged an 18-year captain.

39:48.928 --> 39:51.972
Meanwhile, I'll grab a few headlines
for my own side of things.

39:55.976 --> 39:59.313
Okay, Frank. One month.

39:59.814 --> 40:01.440
I owe you, and this is it.

40:02.775 --> 40:04.151
Just put these away, will you?

40:11.158 --> 40:12.118
Thanks.

40:12.868 --> 40:15.079
I'm sorry you've taken
all this so hard, Frank.

40:16.455 --> 40:19.458
But I gotta tell ya, I feel great.

40:19.959 --> 40:25.214
For the first time in three weeks,
this morning I had a normal sit-down.

40:25.714 --> 40:28.259
I can't tell you what a joy it was.

40:28.342 --> 40:30.928
Went in there with the sports section,
and it was un--

40:31.011 --> 40:32.304
MS. JACKSON: Chief Daniels.

40:39.311 --> 40:41.605
It's gonna be a great day
for the department, Frank.

40:56.537 --> 40:58.956
-Two burgers, well done.
-I said rare, man.

40:59.039 --> 41:01.167
-No, you didn't. You said well done.
-No, I said rare.

41:05.838 --> 41:06.922
Well done.

41:09.925 --> 41:13.429
Yeah, well, anyway,
so you girls are stews, huh?

41:13.512 --> 41:14.472
You fly?

41:15.514 --> 41:17.975
RENKO: I don't like flying much myself,
see, I usually,

41:18.058 --> 41:20.436
I get sick, or I hear
the landing gear go down.

41:20.519 --> 41:23.189
And I think it's a bomb going off,
or somethin' like that.

41:33.824 --> 41:37.620
-Back kind of soon, aren't you?
-Yeah, just driving by.

41:38.120 --> 41:39.997
Saw you got three deep at the bar here.

41:40.873 --> 41:41.790
What do you want?

41:42.166 --> 41:45.836
Ah, you do more business,
you create more problems.

41:46.128 --> 41:47.922
I said, what do you want?

41:48.005 --> 41:51.884
Hey, boy, watch your tone,
would you? More money.

41:52.968 --> 41:56.430
(chatter)

42:05.189 --> 42:09.443
-Everybody, freeze! Nobody gets hurt.
-(patrons screaming)

42:09.527 --> 42:11.612
-(shouts, indistinct)
-Don't move.

42:13.322 --> 42:17.284
-Oh, boy.
-(cocking gun)

42:17.535 --> 42:20.120
ROBBER: This ain't made of soap. Come on!

42:21.580 --> 42:24.166
BELKER: I don't want you to think
I'm being cute, or nothing,

42:24.250 --> 42:28.337
but you, I... I just want you
to take a look around.

42:28.420 --> 42:32.675
-(cocking gun)
-(woman screaming)

42:33.300 --> 42:34.927
Nobody wants to shoot.

42:35.344 --> 42:37.596
Why don't you just back out
the door, nice and easy?

42:37.680 --> 42:40.182
Nobody's gonna shoot.
Go on, nice and easy.

42:51.944 --> 42:54.280
Stop this criminal act!
Stop this criminal act!

42:54.363 --> 42:56.657
(echoing)

43:54.840 --> 43:57.301
-(grunts)
-(siren blaring)

44:00.304 --> 44:01.555
We get 'em, Mick?

44:02.264 --> 44:06.060
Sure we got 'em, Captain.
You keep still now.

44:07.227 --> 44:09.521
My neutro-warp generator failed.

44:11.148 --> 44:12.691
Should've stopped the bullet.

44:12.775 --> 44:15.944
My fault for not checking the batteries.
I...

44:16.111 --> 44:19.531
You gotta keep quiet.
I don't want any talking now.

44:19.615 --> 44:21.492
I can take any amount of pain.

44:23.369 --> 44:25.579
Put the suffering of all
the world on my shoulders.

44:25.663 --> 44:30.709
I can take it. I can take it.
And I ain't afraid to die.

44:32.753 --> 44:35.130
Will you shut up? Nobody's gonna die.

44:35.214 --> 44:38.592
I tell you what, you die, you hairbag,
I'll kick your butt across the block.

44:38.676 --> 44:39.677
(chuckles)

44:40.552 --> 44:42.680
You're looking at the wrong thing, Mick.

44:44.181 --> 44:48.477
You're looking at this. This isn't me.

44:50.104 --> 44:51.230
I'm eternal.

44:52.690 --> 44:56.777
I live in the alley cats
and the buses in the street.

44:58.487 --> 45:01.782
You can't kill me, because I'm the city.

45:02.241 --> 45:06.995
Dan-da-dadan! I am the city. (groans)

45:15.087 --> 45:18.757
The power's in the glove, Mick.
It always was.

45:20.217 --> 45:22.720
It's yours now. You gotta take it.

45:30.185 --> 45:31.812
Here, you take this.

45:33.981 --> 45:35.691
You know we're buddies, don't ya?

45:36.400 --> 45:38.026
You know we fight the same fight.

45:39.653 --> 45:42.865
There, Mick. Out there.

45:44.742 --> 45:48.287
Gangsters, mad scientists,

45:48.370 --> 45:50.873
mutant cave creatures, villains.

45:51.373 --> 45:53.459
They're daring us with their arrogance.

45:55.919 --> 45:58.338
We've got to save the city.

45:59.423 --> 46:01.175
Gotta make it beautiful again.

46:02.217 --> 46:07.514
We gotta feel the wind in our faces,
see the stars over our shoulders.

46:07.890 --> 46:11.810
It's all so clear, Mick. I mean, I--

46:11.894 --> 46:13.896
I can almost reach out and touch it.

46:14.438 --> 46:15.397
Ha!

46:21.195 --> 46:23.530
Oh, Captain--

47:08.534 --> 47:14.206
No sense of responsibility, integrity,
loyalty, generosity or truth.

47:14.289 --> 47:18.210
Period. None. Nada.

47:22.381 --> 47:24.925
A sense of bowel movements, yes.
That he's got.

47:28.846 --> 47:32.850
I wouldn't be the most disappointed person
in the world if you quit the department.

47:34.518 --> 47:36.103
A man with your background and smarts.

47:36.186 --> 47:37.729
There are all kinds of things
you could do.

47:37.813 --> 47:39.648
Mm-hmm. Like what?

47:41.358 --> 47:45.737
I bet you could get a job teaching.
In a university or a law school.

47:49.658 --> 47:52.035
You know, in two more years, I'll be a 20.

47:54.496 --> 47:56.331
Maybe then I'll start thinking about it.

47:58.709 --> 48:01.211
I figured you'd say that. (inhales deeply)

48:07.634 --> 48:09.219
I prayed he wouldn't take it.

48:10.304 --> 48:11.221
Hmm?

48:12.890 --> 48:16.685
When I offered Daniels my gun,
I prayed he wouldn't take it.

48:20.105 --> 48:24.276
Funny. I sort of wish he had.

48:43.795 --> 48:46.798
(closing theme playing)
