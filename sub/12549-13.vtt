WEBVTT

00:06.607 --> 00:08.579
- PREVIOUSLY ON "TWISTED"...
- Reporter: Desai's return

00:08.579 --> 00:11.782
from the juvenile
detention facility has
been met with controversy.

00:11.782 --> 00:16.016
A housekeeper discovered
Regina Crane beaten to death
inside of her home--

00:16.016 --> 00:18.589
Mayor Rollins:
VIKRAM DESAI HAD A SECRET
COMPANY IN CONNECTICUT?

00:18.589 --> 00:20.651
VIKRAM WAS DOING SOMETHING
WITH THIS COMPANY.

00:20.651 --> 00:21.792
VIKRAM IS DEAD.

00:21.792 --> 00:23.494
THERE MUST BE SOMEONE
COVERING FOR HIM.

00:23.494 --> 00:25.056
SOMEONE HAS A VIDEO
OF YOU AND DANNY HOOKING UP.

00:25.056 --> 00:26.697
Lacey: IF IT MAKES IT TO MY
FRIENDS, THEY'LL FORGIVE ME.

00:26.697 --> 00:29.660
- Rico: JO MIGHT NOT!
- WE NEVER WANTED YOU
TO FIND OUT THAT WAY.

00:29.660 --> 00:31.462
JUST GET OUT, ALL OF YOU.

00:31.462 --> 00:33.334
OUR FRIENDSHIP
MEANS SO MUCH TO ME

00:33.334 --> 00:34.735
AND I DON'T
WANNA RISK THAT.

00:34.735 --> 00:36.067
BUT YOU CAN RISK IT
FOR LACEY.

00:36.067 --> 00:38.169
LACEY AND I--
LOOK, WE'RE OVER.

00:38.169 --> 00:39.210
BUT YOU STILL HAVE
FEELINGS FOR HER.

00:40.541 --> 00:42.543
GOODBYE, DANNY.

00:42.543 --> 00:44.715
THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME
THAT I DID THAT.

00:44.715 --> 00:46.647
IT'S THE FIRST TIME
THAT I'VE DONE ANYTHING.

00:46.647 --> 00:47.718
I'M TOTALLY
IN LOVE WITH YOU.

00:47.718 --> 00:49.049
RICO.

00:50.351 --> 00:52.483
- UHM...
- Eddie: IT'S CONFIRMED.

00:52.483 --> 00:55.526
TRACES OF BLOOD
AND HAIR ON THE PIPE
MATCH THE VICTIM.

00:55.526 --> 00:58.259
AND DANNY DESAI'S FINGERPRINTS
ARE ALL OVER IT.

00:58.259 --> 00:59.630
WE HAVE A WARRANT
TO ARREST YOUR SON

00:59.630 --> 01:01.332
FOR THE MURDER
OF REGINA CRANE.

01:01.332 --> 01:03.494
- DANNY DESAI HAS FLED.
- Vikram: Tess, what's wrong?

01:03.494 --> 01:05.496
IT'S TIME FOR YOU
TO COME BACK, VIKRAM.

01:07.138 --> 01:10.641
- ( police radio chatter )
- ( people chattering )

01:10.641 --> 01:13.073
Kyle: CALL EASTWICK
AND SEE WHAT'S TAKING
THAT CHOPPER SO LONG.

01:13.073 --> 01:14.575
MEANWHILE, I WANT YOU
TO WIDEN THE PERIMETER.

01:14.575 --> 01:16.076
START THREE BLOCKS OUT
THEN FOUR.

01:16.076 --> 01:17.678
HE CAN'T HAVE GONE THAT FAR.
AND WHEN YOU FIND HIM,

01:17.678 --> 01:19.380
BRING HIM TO ME,
NOT MARILYN ROSSI.

01:19.380 --> 01:21.512
IT'S MY CASE.
I CALL THE SHOTS.

01:21.512 --> 01:22.783
- ROGER THAT.
- GO.

01:22.783 --> 01:24.785
BEFORE SUNUP
I WANT DESAI IN CUSTODY.

01:26.787 --> 01:28.619
( sighs )

01:33.794 --> 01:35.696
- TELL ME HE'S GONNA BE OKAY.
- ( siren wailing )

01:37.268 --> 01:39.430
WISH I COULD
GUARANTEE THAT, KAREN.

01:43.534 --> 01:46.177
Karen: YOU MENTIONED
THAT WOMAN THAT FOUND
THE MURDER WEAPON.

01:46.177 --> 01:48.639
SHE'S NOT WITH
THE POLICE FORCE,
IS SHE?

01:49.640 --> 01:51.742
AN INVESTIGATOR
BROUGHT IN BY THE MAYOR.

01:53.514 --> 01:56.447
KAREN, I COULD TELL
BY THE WAY YOU LOOKED AT HER
YOU'D SEEN HER BEFORE.

01:56.447 --> 01:59.620
I THOUGHT VIKRAM WAS CHEATING.
I HAD HIM FOLLOWED.

01:59.620 --> 02:01.852
TURNS OUT IT WAS BUSINESS,
NOT AN AFFAIR.

02:01.852 --> 02:04.425
- WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?
- WHAT I'VE BEEN THINKING

02:04.425 --> 02:06.697
SINCE I RECENTLY FOUND
AN APARTMENT IN HIS NAME

02:06.697 --> 02:08.699
AND SEVERAL
ACTIVE BANK ACCOUNTS.

02:10.301 --> 02:11.762
VIKRAM'S ALIVE.

02:13.704 --> 02:16.367
( stammers ) HOW?

02:16.367 --> 02:18.169
I NEED TO USE
YOUR LANDLINE.

02:29.750 --> 02:31.782
( doorbell chimes )

02:31.782 --> 02:33.884
( distant siren )

02:33.884 --> 02:35.726
LACEY, HI. COME IN.

02:35.726 --> 02:38.559
WHAT'S GOING ON?
THERE ARE POLICE CARS
EVERYWHERE.

02:38.559 --> 02:40.791
THEY FOUND EVIDENCE,
A MURDER WEAPON.

02:40.791 --> 02:42.763
- OH.
- THEY WERE GONNA
ARREST DANNY, BUT HE RAN.

02:42.763 --> 02:45.736
- HAVE YOU SEEN HIM?
- NO. WAIT, HE RAN?

02:45.736 --> 02:48.699
I DON'T HAVE
MANY DETAILS.

02:48.699 --> 02:50.641
I ASSUMED THAT'S
WHY YOU WERE HERE--
BECAUSE YOU KNEW.

02:50.641 --> 02:52.743
ACTUALLY, I WAS HERE
TO SEE CHIEF MASTERSON...

02:52.743 --> 02:55.776
ABOUT SOMETHING
DIFFERENT, BUT...
IT MAY BE RELATED. I--

02:55.776 --> 02:58.479
- HE'S OUT ON THE SEARCH.
WHOLE POLICE FORCE IS.
- ( phone ringing )

02:58.479 --> 03:00.711
MAYBE THAT'S HIM.
EXCUSE ME.

03:04.515 --> 03:07.218
( scoffs )
A MURDER WEAPON?

03:07.218 --> 03:08.659
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT
FOR A SECOND.

03:08.659 --> 03:11.492
HIS FINGERPRINTS
WERE ALL OVER IT
AND HE RAN, LACEY.

03:11.492 --> 03:13.264
INNOCENT PEOPLE DON'T RUN.

03:13.264 --> 03:14.865
BUT I FOUND
SOME THINGS OUT.

03:14.865 --> 03:17.598
A FEW DAYS
BEFORE SHE WAS KILLED,
REGINA GOT INTO A FIGHT

03:17.598 --> 03:18.929
WITH SOMEONE
IN A BLACK MERCEDES,

03:18.929 --> 03:21.702
- SHE WAS SCRATCHED AND--
- GOOD. YOU SHOULD TAKE THAT

03:21.702 --> 03:23.534
TO MY DAD
AND HE'S NOT HERE.

03:26.707 --> 03:28.809
- YOU'RE STILL ANGRY.
- I'M NOT ANGRY.

03:28.809 --> 03:31.442
I'M JUST TIRED OF IT ALL.

03:31.442 --> 03:34.815
OKAY. TELL YOUR DAD
I STOPPED BY AND THAT
IT'S IMPORTANT.

03:34.815 --> 03:37.788
- PLEASE.
- MM-HMM.

03:38.889 --> 03:40.821
( sighs )
SEE YOU LATER, JO.

03:41.922 --> 03:43.494
( door opens )

03:43.494 --> 03:45.926
I'LL TELL HER. OKAY.

03:45.926 --> 03:47.828
BE SAFE.

03:48.829 --> 03:50.731
- ( beeps )
- YOUR DAD--

03:50.731 --> 03:54.435
HE WANTS YOU-- US--
TO STAY CLOSE TO THE HOUSE.

03:55.766 --> 03:58.739
- OKAY.
- LOOK, THEY'LL FIND HIM.

04:00.010 --> 04:01.542
I DON'T REALLY CARE ANYMORE.

04:01.542 --> 04:02.743
NOW I SEE HIM
FOR WHO HE REALLY IS--

04:02.743 --> 04:03.944
HE LIES,
HE KEEPS SECRETS.

04:03.944 --> 04:06.617
I KNOW, BUT YOU ALWAYS
SUPPORTED HIM.

04:06.617 --> 04:09.850
WELL, MAYBE I DON'T ANYMORE.
I JUST--

04:09.850 --> 04:11.682
MY WHOLE LIKE WOULD BE
SO MUCH BETTER

04:11.682 --> 04:13.454
- IF HE HAD NEVER BEEN IN IT.
- ( cellphone buzzes )

04:20.691 --> 04:24.595
- I HOPE THAT WASN'T DANNY.
- NO, IT'S A WHOLE
DIFFERENT MISTAKE.

04:26.967 --> 04:28.769
( sighs )

04:32.042 --> 04:33.704
- JO. DON'T FREAK OUT.
- ( gasps )

04:33.704 --> 04:36.006
OH MY GOD. DANNY.

04:36.006 --> 04:37.578
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

04:37.578 --> 04:39.750
I NEEDED TO SEE YOU.
I HEARD SOME THINGS--

04:39.750 --> 04:43.053
NO. NO, THIS IS
THE LAST PLACE THAT
YOU SHOULD'VE COME.

04:43.053 --> 04:45.456
LOOK, I KNOW, OKAY?
I HURT YOU.

04:46.817 --> 04:49.289
AND IT WASN'T
THE FIRST TIME, BUT...

04:49.289 --> 04:51.692
JO, I'M BEING FRAMED.

04:51.692 --> 04:54.365
- SO GIVE YOURSELF UP.
DON'T RUN.
- I CAN'T.

04:54.365 --> 04:56.367
I CAN'T. NOT YET.

04:56.367 --> 04:58.729
THEY HAVE A MURDER WEAPON.
THEY HAVE YOUR PRINTS.

04:58.729 --> 05:00.771
IT'S FAKE. IT'S FAKE.

05:00.771 --> 05:02.002
IT HAS TO BE FAKE.

05:02.002 --> 05:04.505
I JUST NEED
A LITTLE BIT OF TIME

05:04.505 --> 05:06.677
- TO FIGURE THIS OUT.
- JUST STAY AWAY FROM ME,
DANNY, OKAY?

05:08.308 --> 05:09.840
I DON'T THINK YOU UNDERSTAND.

05:09.840 --> 05:11.882
I HEARD MY MOM
AND YOUR DAD TALKING.

05:11.882 --> 05:15.446
THIS WOMAN,
THE ONE WHO FOUND
THE MURDER WEAPON--

05:15.446 --> 05:17.548
- SHE'S CONNECTED TO MY FATHER.
- YOU'RE NOT GETTING IT!

05:17.548 --> 05:19.790
- I DON'T CARE!
- JO, YOU'RE NOT LISTENING.

05:19.790 --> 05:21.492
- THEY THINK
MY FATHER'S ALIVE.
- JUST--

05:22.753 --> 05:24.024
( shouts ) MOM!

05:25.756 --> 05:27.027
JO, PLEASE.

05:27.027 --> 05:29.730
MOM, HURRY,
HE'S UP HERE!

05:35.766 --> 05:37.408
( rustling )

05:37.408 --> 05:39.410
( theme music playing )

05:54.885 --> 05:56.086
DANNY?

06:04.565 --> 06:05.936
( mutters )

06:08.699 --> 06:09.870
DANNY!

06:09.870 --> 06:12.443
DANNY!
DANNY, WAIT.

06:13.804 --> 06:15.506
- YOU'RE NOT DANNY.
- ( siren approaching )

06:15.506 --> 06:18.809
- UH, NO. NO, I'M NOT.
- ( helicopter overhead )

06:18.809 --> 06:22.082
- BUT HEY, I COULD BE.
- I...

06:22.082 --> 06:23.684
( car door closes )

06:24.685 --> 06:26.887
FREEZE!
HOLD IT RIGHT THERE.

06:26.887 --> 06:28.589
NO, IT'S NOT HIM.
IT'S NOT DANNY.

06:28.589 --> 06:31.091
- DUDE, THE HOOD. THE HOOD.
- ( police radio chatter )

06:31.091 --> 06:32.923
GUYS, WE NEED
EVERYBODY INSIDE.

06:32.923 --> 06:34.765
WE'VE GOT THIS KID
RUNNING AROUND LOOSE.

06:34.765 --> 06:36.667
YOU NEED TO GO HOME,
BOTH OF YOU.

06:36.667 --> 06:37.798
YES, SIR.

06:40.671 --> 06:43.874
( sighs )
LOOK, I'M--
I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.

06:43.874 --> 06:47.107
- DO I KNOW YOU?
- NO, I'M CHARLIE McBRIDE.

06:47.107 --> 06:51.181
I'M NEW IN TOWN.
I START MID-TERM TOMORROW
AT GREEN GROVE HIGH.

06:51.181 --> 06:52.713
WHAT'S UP
WITH THIS DANNY GUY?

06:53.744 --> 06:56.717
UMM, IT'S A LONG STORY,

06:56.717 --> 06:58.048
AND I REALLY DON'T
HAVE TIME TO TELL IT.

06:58.048 --> 06:59.450
SO I'LL SEE YOU AT SCHOOL.

06:59.450 --> 07:02.793
YEAH. I LOOK
FORWARD TO IT.

07:02.793 --> 07:05.055
( siren blaring )

07:07.958 --> 07:10.701
- HE WAS HERE?
- UPSTAIRS.

07:10.701 --> 07:12.903
HE CAME IN THAT WINDOW
THEY USED TO USE AS KIDS.

07:12.903 --> 07:16.106
JO, HONEY, WHAT DID HE SAY?
WHY WAS HE HERE?

07:16.106 --> 07:18.769
HEY, YOU GOTTA TELL ME
EVERYTHING, OKAY?

07:18.769 --> 07:23.073
OKAY, HE SAID THAT HE HEARD
SOME STUFF AT HIS HOUSE--

07:23.073 --> 07:26.877
YOU AND HIS MOM TALKING
ABOUT HIS DAD BEING ALIVE--

07:26.877 --> 07:29.079
AND NEEDING TIME.

07:29.079 --> 07:31.151
I CALLED FOR MOM.
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO.

07:31.151 --> 07:33.223
IT'S OKAY, BABY.

07:33.223 --> 07:34.755
YOU DID THE RIGHT THING.

07:39.189 --> 07:41.892
OKAY, BUT IF YOU HEAR
ANYTHING OR SEE HIM,

07:41.892 --> 07:43.734
YOU NEED TO CONTACT
THE POLICE RIGHT AWAY.

07:43.734 --> 07:45.195
YES, OF COURSE.

07:45.195 --> 07:46.937
( rock music playing )

07:53.604 --> 07:55.906
YEAH, THEY--
THEY TALKED TO ME, TOO.

07:55.906 --> 07:58.579
THEY'RE TALKING TO EVERYONE,
EVEN THE LITTLE PEOPLE.

07:58.579 --> 07:59.950
( sighs )

08:08.488 --> 08:10.591
MAN, THIS DANNY THING
IS GETTING OUT OF CONTROL.

08:10.591 --> 08:13.694
I SAW JO. SHE WOULDN'T
EVEN TALK TO ME ABOUT IT.

08:13.694 --> 08:17.097
INTERESTING COINCIDENCE,
SINCE I DON'T WANT TO TALK
ABOUT IT, HER OR DANNY EITHER.

08:17.097 --> 08:20.200
- YOU AND JO ARE SO CLOSE.
- YEAH, LIKE TWO PEAS
IN TWO PODS

08:20.200 --> 08:22.502
IN TWO DIFFERENT CORNERS
OF THE UNIVERSE.

08:22.502 --> 08:24.835
IF YOU DON'T MIND ME SAYING,
YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'VE GOT
A LOT ON YOUR SHOULDERS.

08:27.277 --> 08:28.879
I SORTA DO.

08:30.510 --> 08:32.843
- THANK YOU.
- LOOK, IF YOU'RE ASKING ME--

08:32.843 --> 08:35.786
WHICH I DON'T THINK YOU ARE--

08:35.786 --> 08:38.649
I'D SAY YOU KINDA
STOMPED ON JO'S HEART

08:38.649 --> 08:40.150
AND SHE'S NOT JUST GONNA
FORGIVE YOU OVERNIGHT.

08:40.150 --> 08:42.222
I KNOW THAT. I DO.

08:42.222 --> 08:45.225
BUT YOU CAN HOPE, RIGHT?
I THINK THE THING IS

08:45.225 --> 08:46.997
JO DOESN'T KNOW
WHAT SHE WANTS.

08:46.997 --> 08:48.899
WELL, I KNOW WHAT I WANT.

08:48.899 --> 08:51.101
DANNY BACK--
IT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS.

08:51.101 --> 08:53.904
NO, I TREATED HIM POORLY,

08:53.904 --> 08:56.166
AND NOW HE'S IN
ALL THIS TROUBLE.
I JUST WANNA HELP HIM.

08:56.166 --> 08:59.239
IF ONLY HE'LL COME IN
FROM OUT OF THE COLD.

08:59.239 --> 09:00.871
( shivers )

09:00.871 --> 09:02.573
IT'S ALL VERY
"BOURNE IDENTITY,"
ISN'T IT,

09:02.573 --> 09:04.815
IN A TRAGIC
TEENAGE KIND OF WAY?

09:06.917 --> 09:11.321
- THIS IS FOR THE COFFEE.
I'LL SEE YOU LATER, RICO.
- ALL RIGHT.

09:13.023 --> 09:15.856
HMM, GOT YOURSELF
A NEW FRIEND.

09:15.856 --> 09:18.228
BRANCHING OUT. THAT JO--

09:18.228 --> 09:20.030
IS AMAZINGLY COMPLICATED
AND OUT OF MY LIFE,

09:20.030 --> 09:21.892
SO IF YOU COULD JUST
NEVER MENTION HER AGAIN.

09:21.892 --> 09:23.834
WHATEVER.

09:26.166 --> 09:30.200
HE HEARD US IN THE HOUSE?
I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW
THAT'S POSSIBLE.

09:30.200 --> 09:32.002
I DON'T KNOW.
HE JUST CAME INTO MY ROOM

09:32.002 --> 09:34.745
SAYING THAT HIS DAD WAS ALIVE
AND THAT HE NEEDED MY HELP.

09:34.745 --> 09:37.577
- BUT INSTEAD OF HELPING,
YOU CALLED FOR TESS.
- OF COURSE SHE DID.

09:37.577 --> 09:39.880
- IT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO.
- BUT NOW HE'S RUNNING AGAIN

09:39.880 --> 09:42.182
AND WE HAVE NO IDEA WHERE!

09:42.182 --> 09:44.855
JO, I'M SORRY.
I DON'T MEAN TO
TAKE THIS OUT ON YOU.

09:44.855 --> 09:48.088
- THIS IS JUST SUCH A MESS.
- WE'RE GONNA FIND HIM, KAREN.

09:48.088 --> 09:51.291
- I'VE GOT EVERY UNIT ON IT.
- GOD! WHAT WAS DANNY THINKING?

09:51.291 --> 09:52.963
PLEASE!
THE REALITY IS

09:52.963 --> 09:55.766
NO ONE KNOWS
HOW DANNY THINKS!

09:55.766 --> 09:58.298
I'M JUST...
TIRED OF GUESSING.

09:59.670 --> 10:01.632
I'LL GO TALK TO HER.

10:02.903 --> 10:04.104
KYLE, I'M SORRY.

10:04.104 --> 10:06.907
I-- I KNOW YOU'RE DOING
EVERYTHING YOU CAN.

10:07.978 --> 10:09.740
( mouths )

10:09.740 --> 10:11.211
( knocks )

10:15.345 --> 10:18.088
MUST BE HARD,
ALL THIS DANNY BUSINESS.

10:18.088 --> 10:21.291
I MEAN, YEAH.
I GUESS IT STARTED
WITH DANNY...

10:21.291 --> 10:23.724
AND HIS LIES.

10:26.356 --> 10:28.799
I DON'T KNOW.
IT DOESN'T MATTER.
I JUST FEEL--

10:28.799 --> 10:30.701
I JUST FEEL STUPID.

10:30.701 --> 10:33.003
YOUR DAD TOLD YOU
CALLING FOR US WAS
THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

10:33.003 --> 10:35.265
I DON'T EVEN CARE ABOUT THAT.
IT'S NOT ABOUT DANNY.

10:35.265 --> 10:37.808
THEN WHAT IS IT?
TALK TO ME.

10:37.808 --> 10:39.810
IT'S-- ( sighs )

10:39.810 --> 10:42.342
IT'S NOTHING, MOM,
I JUST--

10:42.342 --> 10:45.946
CAN YOU JUST GO?
I JUST REALLY WANNA BE
BY MYSELF. CAN YOU JUST--

10:45.946 --> 10:47.948
OKAY.

10:49.119 --> 10:50.921
- ( sighs )
- MOM?

10:55.786 --> 10:57.858
( crying )
I SLEPT WITH TYLER.

11:01.091 --> 11:03.033
OH, JO.

11:05.265 --> 11:08.038
IT WAS MY FIRST TIME
AND IT WAS A MISTAKE.

11:11.171 --> 11:14.104
IT WAS WITH THE WRONG GUY
AND FOR THE WRONG REASONS

11:14.104 --> 11:18.879
AND I JUST FEEL--
I JUST FEEL SO STUPID.

11:18.879 --> 11:20.911
IT'S OKAY.

11:20.911 --> 11:23.914
I JUST FEEL STUPID, MOM.

11:23.914 --> 11:26.286
YOU'RE OKAY, HONEY.

11:32.222 --> 11:33.924
LOOK...

11:36.727 --> 11:39.770
( sighs )
WE ALL DO THINGS
WE REGRET.

11:42.933 --> 11:44.875
WE SET OURSELVES UP...

11:45.976 --> 11:50.280
TO HURT, BUT HURT'S
NOT ALWAYS A BAD THING.

11:50.280 --> 11:52.142
IT DOESN'T FEEL THAT WAY.

11:54.384 --> 11:56.416
IT JUST HURTS.

11:58.919 --> 12:01.251
BUT YOU WON'T FEEL
LIKE THAT FOREVER.

12:04.424 --> 12:06.857
OTHER GUYS WILL COME ALONG

12:08.959 --> 12:10.831
ONE OF THEM WILL BE
THE RIGHT GUY.

12:14.334 --> 12:16.736
WHEN IT IS THE RIGHT GUY...

12:19.439 --> 12:23.143
IN A BEAUTIFUL WAY,
YOU'LL GET THAT FIRST TIME
ALL OVER AGAIN.

12:23.143 --> 12:25.145
( sobbing )

12:43.033 --> 12:45.035
EXCUSE ME,
CHIEF MASTERSON.

12:45.035 --> 12:46.967
HEY, LACEY,
SHOULDN'T YOU BE IN SCHOOL?

12:46.967 --> 12:48.768
I WAS LOOKING
FOR YOU LAST NIGHT.
DIDN'T JO TELL YOU?

12:48.768 --> 12:51.271
- A LOT GOING ON LAST NIGHT.
- I KNOW, IT'S JUST

12:51.271 --> 12:52.973
I FOUND SOME THINGS OUT.

12:52.973 --> 12:55.806
REGINA HAD THESE
NASTY SCRATCH MARKS
ON HER ARM,

12:55.806 --> 12:58.148
AND SHE LIED
AND SAID PHOEBE DID IT,
BUT IT WAS SOMEONE ELSE.

12:58.148 --> 13:00.280
AND IT ALL HAPPENED
IN A CAR OUTSIDE OF SCHOOL.

13:00.280 --> 13:01.982
WHOSE CAR? HER CAR?
HER MOTHER'S?

13:01.982 --> 13:04.354
A MERCEDES WITH TINTED WINDOWS
AND CONNECTICUT PLATES.

13:06.386 --> 13:07.918
THAT'S VERY INTERESTING,
LACEY.

13:07.918 --> 13:09.119
WE'RE WORKING
ON SOME OTHER LEADS.

13:09.119 --> 13:11.061
THANK YOU
FOR YOUR CONCERN.

13:11.061 --> 13:14.264
WE KINDA NEED YOU TO FORGET
ABOUT THIS, GO TO SCHOOL

13:14.264 --> 13:15.465
- AND LET US HANDLE IT, OKAY?
- BUT I--

13:17.868 --> 13:20.500
- OKAY.
- WE'LL HANDLE IT.

13:23.473 --> 13:27.037
- MARILYN'S CAR?
- MARILYN'S CAR WITH HER
IN IT WATCHING US,

13:27.037 --> 13:29.139
SO WHEN I ASK YOU
TO DOUBLE-CHECK AND VERIFY

13:29.139 --> 13:30.480
ANY PERTINENT
FORENSIC REPORTS

13:30.480 --> 13:32.542
CONCERNING THIS
MURDER WEAPON SHE UNEARTHED,

13:32.542 --> 13:35.415
LET'S JUST PRETEND
I'M GIVING YOU
MY LUNCH ORDER.

13:36.847 --> 13:39.449
PASTRAMI ON RYE,
EXTRA PICKLES, COLESLAW.

13:39.449 --> 13:42.122
- GOT IT.
- Kyle: THAT'S IT.

13:42.122 --> 13:44.394
- ( school bell rings )
- ( kids chattering )

13:46.256 --> 13:50.430
A FAMILIAR FACE.
UH, THE ONLY FAMILIAR FACE.

13:50.430 --> 13:52.102
LACEY, RIGHT?

13:52.102 --> 13:54.564
CHARLIE, THE GUY
IN THE PARK LAST NIGHT.

13:54.564 --> 13:56.236
RIGHT.
HOW'S IT GOING, CHARLIE?

13:56.236 --> 13:59.409
- UH, YOU KNOW.
- YOU LOOK A LITTLE LOST.

13:59.409 --> 14:03.073
WELL, LOST AND NOW FOUND.

14:03.073 --> 14:07.177
WOW. DID LINES
LIKE THAT WORK ON GIRLS
IN YOUR LAST SCHOOL?

14:09.179 --> 14:12.252
THERE WEREN'T ANY GIRLS
LIKE YOU AT MY LAST SCHOOL.

14:12.252 --> 14:16.286
- HEY, SO I HAVE CHEM 212.
- MM-HMM.

14:16.286 --> 14:19.289
- I'M THINKING UPSTAIRS MAYBE?
- YEAH, USE THOSE STAIRS

14:19.289 --> 14:20.390
AND IT'S THE FIRST DOOR
ON YOUR RIGHT.

14:20.390 --> 14:21.962
HEY, NEW GUY.
BYE, NEW GUY.

14:21.962 --> 14:23.593
HEY, IT WAS
REALLY GREAT, YOU KNOW,

14:23.593 --> 14:26.096
CONNECTING WITH YOU AND--

14:26.096 --> 14:27.467
IS SOMETHING
ON YOUR MIND?

14:27.467 --> 14:30.500
- WELL, NO. UMM--
- NO?

14:30.500 --> 14:31.871
WELL, YEAH,
ACTUALLY YEAH.

14:31.871 --> 14:34.004
STIPPLING. STIPPLING.

14:34.004 --> 14:35.946
IT'S HOW YOU PAINT
WITH A SPONGE.

14:35.946 --> 14:38.448
ANYWAYS,
IT'S A TWO-MAN JOB,

14:38.448 --> 14:41.651
SO IT'S-- IT COULD BE
A ONE MAN, ONE WOMAN JOB.

14:41.651 --> 14:44.354
TWO PEOPLE.
I NEED TWO PEOPLE.

14:44.354 --> 14:47.017
I'D LOVE TO GO TO YOUR PLACE
AFTER SCHOOL, RICO.

14:47.017 --> 14:49.119
AND HEY, MAYBE ON THE WAY

14:49.119 --> 14:52.022
YOU CAN TELL ME
THE REAL REASON WHY
YOU WANT ME THERE.

14:52.022 --> 14:53.563
HEY.

14:54.594 --> 14:58.328
HEY. OKAY, GOTTA GO.

14:58.328 --> 14:59.429
RICO, WAIT.

15:01.331 --> 15:03.303
- ABOUT LAST NIGHT--
- WHAT ABOUT IT?

15:03.303 --> 15:04.504
DID YOU LEAVE
SOMETHING OUT?

15:06.236 --> 15:09.909
- NO. YOU'RE PISSED, RIGHT?
- PISSED? NO, I'M FINE.

15:09.909 --> 15:11.381
I'M ACTUALLY
RUNNING LATE FOR CLASS.

15:12.412 --> 15:14.084
OH.

15:16.016 --> 15:19.189
I TALKED TO YOUR FATHER
THIS MORNING. I GUESS YOU
DIDN'T PASS ALONG MY MESSAGE.

15:19.189 --> 15:21.191
DANNY CAME
TO MY ROOM LAST NIGHT.

15:24.194 --> 15:25.295
YOUR ROOM?

15:26.957 --> 15:31.061
( sighs )
DID YOU AT LEAST
TELL HIM MY SUSPICIONS?

15:31.061 --> 15:33.033
NO, I CALLED
FOR MY MOTHER.

15:33.033 --> 15:35.135
WHAT? WHY?

15:35.135 --> 15:37.307
BECAUSE HE'S A KILLER
ON THE RUN.

15:38.508 --> 15:41.972
WHAT DID HE SAY?
DID HE ADMIT SOMETHING?

15:41.972 --> 15:44.344
OKAY, HE SAID
THAT HE HEARD
SOMETHING AND THAT...

15:45.575 --> 15:47.317
THAT HIS FATHER IS ALIVE.

15:49.279 --> 15:51.221
( whispers )
MR. DESAI IS ALIVE?

15:51.221 --> 15:53.283
YEAH, HE OVERHEARD
MY DAD AND HIS MOM TALKING

15:53.283 --> 15:54.724
AND THEY ALL SEEM TO THINK
THAT HE'S OUT THERE.

15:54.724 --> 15:57.057
GOD. JO, WHY DID
YOU TURN HIM IN?

15:57.057 --> 15:58.658
BECAUSE IT WAS
THE RIGHT THING
TO DO, LACEY.

15:58.658 --> 16:01.431
BECAUSE NONE OF US
SHOULD BE INVOLVED IN THIS.

16:01.431 --> 16:05.265
OKAY. SO WHAT, YOU WANT HIM
TO GET SENT AWAY AGAIN?

16:05.265 --> 16:07.267
NO, I JUST WANT HIM
TO TELL THE TRUTH.

16:07.267 --> 16:08.638
HE IS TELLING THE TRUTH.

16:09.739 --> 16:11.271
BELIEVE WHAT
YOU WANT TO BELIEVE.

16:11.271 --> 16:14.044
( school bell rings )

16:15.505 --> 16:18.608
As the search widens
for fugitive Danny Desai,

16:18.608 --> 16:21.681
police still have
no confirmed sightings
of the young man.

16:21.681 --> 16:24.114
They are asking
for the public's help

16:24.114 --> 16:26.616
in apprehending
this murder suspect.

16:26.616 --> 16:29.259
- More on this case
coming up.
- ( clicks )

16:45.775 --> 16:49.309
TESS.
I WASN'T EXPECTING YOU.

16:49.309 --> 16:52.042
YEAH, SORRY FOR
NOT CALLING. I--

16:52.042 --> 16:54.384
IT DOESN'T SEEM POSSIBLE.
I MEAN, DOES IT TO YOU?

16:54.384 --> 16:56.486
WHAT, THAT VIKRAM'S ALIVE?

16:56.486 --> 16:59.249
- AND FRAMING DANNY.
- ( sighs )

17:00.350 --> 17:02.292
I JUST THOUGHT...

17:02.292 --> 17:04.294
YOU MIGHT'VE HAD
SOME SENSE HE WAS ALIVE.

17:05.295 --> 17:06.626
NOT AT ALL.

17:06.626 --> 17:09.129
AND THIS IDEA
THAT HE'S FRAMING DANNY--

17:09.129 --> 17:12.632
VIKRAM HAS HIS FLAWS
AND PLENTY OF SECRETS,

17:12.632 --> 17:15.165
BUT HE LOVED HIS SON.

17:15.165 --> 17:17.607
AND THE HARDEST THING IS
THAT HE DIDN'T COME TO ME.

17:18.638 --> 17:20.710
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE THAT--

17:20.710 --> 17:24.744
- WHAT?
- WELL, NO ONE ELSE
HAS KNOWN HE'S ALIVE.

17:24.744 --> 17:27.817
HE SOMEHOW MANAGED
TO KEEP IT A COMPLETE SECRET.

17:27.817 --> 17:30.220
I KNOW. IT'S WEIRD.

17:32.552 --> 17:35.185
I GUESS WHEN KYLE FINDS HIM,
WE'LL GET YOUR ANSWERS.

17:36.526 --> 17:38.188
YOUR ANSWERS, TOO.

17:42.292 --> 17:43.793
OKAY, CAN WE GO
A LITTLE FASTER PLEASE?

17:43.793 --> 17:45.265
I DON'T NEED
MY MOM TO SEE US.

17:45.265 --> 17:47.167
WHAT, SHE DOESN'T APPROVE
OF STIPPLING?

17:47.167 --> 17:49.299
UH, IT'S NOT EXACTLY
HER THING,

17:49.299 --> 17:52.672
OR MINE EITHER,
WHICH I THINK YOU
ALREADY FIGURED OUT.

17:58.378 --> 18:00.079
OKAY.

18:01.251 --> 18:03.713
DANNY.
OH MY GOD, YOU'RE OKAY.

18:06.316 --> 18:08.118
I NEEDED TO SEE YOU.

18:08.118 --> 18:11.391
REMEMBER OUR DEAL--
24 HOURS, NOT A SECOND LONGER,

18:11.391 --> 18:14.164
WHICH GIVES YOU ROUGHLY--
I DON'T-- I--

18:14.164 --> 18:16.826
17 HOURS, 36 MINUTES,
11 SECONDS.

18:16.826 --> 18:21.201
- GOT IT.
- LIKE-- OKAY.

18:21.201 --> 18:24.304
- ( sighs )
- RICO. REALLY?

18:24.304 --> 18:25.575
DIDN'T HAVE ANOTHER CHOICE.

18:28.638 --> 18:30.740
YOU KNOW THE WAY
INTO MY BEDROOM, TOO.

18:30.740 --> 18:34.384
I KNOW, I JUST--
WE WEREN'T EXACTLY
IN THE GREATEST PLACE, EITHER.

18:34.384 --> 18:37.217
I KNOW AND I'M SORRY.

18:37.217 --> 18:39.118
I WAS CAUGHT UP
IN WHAT MY FRIENDS THINK.

18:39.118 --> 18:42.121
LACEY, LACEY, IT--
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

18:42.121 --> 18:43.423
IT DOES, TO ME.

18:50.860 --> 18:53.463
YOU HEAR THEY THINK
MY FATHER'S ALIVE?

18:54.334 --> 18:55.705
YEAH YEAH, JO TOLD ME.

18:56.906 --> 18:58.768
I NEED TO FIND HIM, LACEY.

19:01.811 --> 19:03.313
I'LL HELP YOU...

19:04.614 --> 19:06.546
ANY WAY I CAN.
YOU KNOW THAT.

19:50.420 --> 19:51.691
Jack:
HELLO, KAREN.

20:06.376 --> 20:07.977
I HAVE A PROBLEM, JACK.

20:07.977 --> 20:11.581
MUST BE A PRETTY BIG ONE
FOR YOU TO COME HERE
AFTER ALL THIS TIME.

20:11.581 --> 20:13.413
I THINK
VIKRAM MIGHT BE ALIVE.

20:15.245 --> 20:16.546
OAKY, THAT'S BIG.

20:16.546 --> 20:18.548
BUT YOU'RE NOT SURPRISED.

20:18.548 --> 20:21.521
NOTHING VIKRAM DID
EVER SURPRISED ME.

20:21.521 --> 20:23.653
FAKING HIS OWN DEATH WOULD--

20:23.653 --> 20:25.695
WELL, IT WOULD SEEM
RIGHT IN LINE.

20:27.557 --> 20:29.899
NO, I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM.
NO, I DON'T KNOW WHERE HE IS.

20:29.899 --> 20:32.602
- WHY WOULD I?
- BECAUSE YOU WERE
MORE THAN AN EMPLOYEE.

20:32.602 --> 20:34.434
YOU WERE A TRUSTED FRIEND.

20:34.434 --> 20:36.466
I QUIT THAT JOB A WHILE AGO.
YOU KNOW THAT.

20:37.437 --> 20:38.938
AND YOU KNOW WHY.

20:38.938 --> 20:41.441
- YES, I KNOW WHY.
- GOOD.

20:42.442 --> 20:43.673
I NEED YOUR HELP.

20:47.847 --> 20:49.649
CAN'T DO IT, KAREN.

20:51.250 --> 20:52.722
I'M TURNING YOU DOWN.

20:52.722 --> 20:54.724
THERE'S A SWITCH, HUH?

20:55.825 --> 20:57.687
I KNOW IT'S INSANE TO ASK,

20:57.687 --> 21:00.259
BUT DANNY'S
OUT THERE ON THE RUN,

21:00.259 --> 21:02.892
- BEING FRAMED
AND IF VIKRAM IS ALIVE--
- ( slams )

21:04.434 --> 21:05.795
I SAID I CAN'T.

21:06.996 --> 21:09.339
I GOT MYSELF
TO THINK ABOUT NOW.

21:09.339 --> 21:11.301
I CAN'T GO BACK THERE.

21:13.673 --> 21:16.546
OKAY. I'M SORRY.

21:21.981 --> 21:24.484
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I WAS THINKING.

21:24.484 --> 21:25.685
WAIT.

21:30.490 --> 21:31.991
I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO.

21:35.395 --> 21:36.996
Eddie:
I PULLED ALL THE PAPERWORK
ON THE MURDER WEAPON.

21:36.996 --> 21:39.829
- NOTHING SO FAR.
- KEEP DIGGING.

21:44.874 --> 21:48.508
IS MARILYN STILL STAYING
AT THE MOSS LAKE MOTEL
OUT BY THE INTERSTATE?

21:48.508 --> 21:50.380
- PRETTY SURE, WHY?
- GO OUT THERE

21:50.380 --> 21:52.342
AND TELL HER THERE'S BEEN
A POSSIBLE DESAI SIGHTING

21:52.342 --> 21:53.943
JUST SOUTH
OF THE EASTSIDE FERRY.

21:53.943 --> 21:56.746
- THAT'S A 30-MINUTE DRIVE.
- UNLESS YOU DRIVE
THE SPEED LIMIT,

21:56.746 --> 21:58.718
AND THEN IT'S 45.

22:01.791 --> 22:03.353
( door opens )

22:10.530 --> 22:12.832
SHOWTIME.

22:12.832 --> 22:16.406
ALL RIGHT,
ONCE IT GETS DARK,

22:16.406 --> 22:18.768
YOU GOTTA--
YOU GOTTA KEEP THESE CLOSED

22:18.768 --> 22:22.041
OR TURN THE LAMP OFF.
OR BOTH.

22:22.041 --> 22:24.644
( mutters )

22:31.481 --> 22:33.653
ALL RIGHT.
( sighs )

22:35.585 --> 22:38.388
- WHAT?
- I JUST WANTED
TO SAY THANK YOU, RICO,

22:38.388 --> 22:40.690
FOR DOING THIS.
I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

22:40.690 --> 22:43.132
YEAH, SURE.
GREAT, MAN.

22:45.595 --> 22:47.937
YOU'RE OKAY, THOUGH,
RIGHT? YOU'RE NOT--
YOU'RE NOT FREAKING OUT?

22:47.937 --> 22:49.769
OH NO NO NO, I'M FINE.
I'M ALL RIGHT.

22:49.769 --> 22:54.744
MAYBE JUST A LITTLE BIT
WITH EACH PASSING SECOND,
YOU KNOW?

22:54.744 --> 22:58.508
SURE, IN THE BEGINNING
IT WAS ALL KIND OF COOL
AND DANGEROUS

22:58.508 --> 23:00.680
AND IT WAS LIKE, "WOW,
I'M ACTUALLY DOING THIS.

23:00.680 --> 23:02.482
I'M HARBORING A FUGITIVE--

23:02.482 --> 23:04.854
I'M SORRY,
AN ACCUSED FUGITIVE."

23:04.854 --> 23:06.756
AND THERE WAS
THIS ADVENTURE.

23:06.756 --> 23:09.489
AND THERE WAS THIS RUSH.
THERE WAS THIS INSANE RUSH.

23:10.860 --> 23:13.022
- AT FIRST.
- AT FIRST, YEAH YEAH.

23:14.163 --> 23:15.865
AND NOW?

23:15.865 --> 23:17.727
NOW I'M STARTING
TO PUDDLE.

23:17.727 --> 23:19.499
YEAH, WELL,
IT WON'T BE MUCH LONGER.

23:19.499 --> 23:21.671
I JUST GOTTA FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO FIND MY FATHER.

23:24.674 --> 23:26.736
I DON'T GET IT, MAN.
HOW CAN YOU HEAR

23:26.736 --> 23:30.440
ALL THAT PURE, HONEST EMOTION
FROM JO AND NOT JUST CRUMBLE?

23:31.711 --> 23:33.643
THOSE EYES
OR HER LITTLE POUT.

23:33.643 --> 23:36.846
( chuckles )
AND THE WAY SHE LAUGHS,
IT'S MELLIFLUOUS.

23:38.988 --> 23:40.520
OKAY, BIG WORD, SORRY.

23:41.591 --> 23:42.652
RICO, I--

23:43.653 --> 23:46.796
I'M AWARE
OF HOW AMAZING JO IS

23:46.796 --> 23:51.531
AND... IT JUST--
IT JUST WOULDN'T WORK
BETWEEN US.

23:51.531 --> 23:53.703
LAST NIGHT I SAW
HOW MUCH I HURT HER

23:53.703 --> 23:56.035
WITH THE SECRETS
AND I JUST--

23:56.035 --> 23:58.437
I DON'T THINK
THAT SHE'LL BE ABLE
TO TRUST ME.

23:58.437 --> 24:01.471
- AND I GET IT.
- DO YOU, MAN?

24:01.471 --> 24:03.142
WHEN SOMEONE BARES
THEIR SOUL LIKE THAT

24:03.142 --> 24:06.916
PUTS IT ALL
OUT THERE AND DOESN'T GET
ANYTHING BACK, IT'S--

24:06.916 --> 24:10.880
SURE, AT FIRST,
IT'S COMPLETELY FREEING
AND YOU'RE LIKE THE MAN--

24:10.880 --> 24:14.554
OR, I'M SORRY, THE WOMAN
IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT JO.

24:15.925 --> 24:18.157
BUT WHEN YOU FIND OUT
IT'S NOT MUTUAL...

24:19.158 --> 24:20.960
IT SUCKS.

24:22.161 --> 24:23.893
( garage door opening )

24:26.035 --> 24:29.038
OH, DAD'S HOME.
OKAY, NOT A SOUND.

24:34.974 --> 24:37.677
- APPRECIATE THIS.
- A WARRANT'S A WARRANT.

24:37.677 --> 24:38.908
THIS IS IT.

24:40.710 --> 24:41.981
( knocks )

24:43.853 --> 24:45.555
( lock beeps )

24:45.555 --> 24:46.856
THANKS,
I'LL TAKE IT FROM HERE.

25:29.729 --> 25:31.601
- THANKS.
- Woman: OF COURSE.

25:31.601 --> 25:33.733
- KEEP THE CHANGE.
- Jo: LACEY.

25:33.733 --> 25:36.265
OH. HI, JO.

25:37.536 --> 25:39.939
EARLY DINNER FOR MY MOM,
MY SISTER AND ME.

25:41.571 --> 25:43.713
- HOW ARE YOU DOING?
- I'M JUST LOOKING FOR RICO.

25:43.713 --> 25:45.845
HE ALWAYS COMES HERE
AFTER SCHOOL.

25:45.845 --> 25:49.148
MMM. I GUESS HE HAD
A CHANGE IN PLANS.

25:49.148 --> 25:52.652
HE NEVER CHANGES HIS PLANS.
HE'S A LITTLE O.C.D. THAT WAY.

25:52.652 --> 25:55.154
WELL, YOU KNOW HIM
BETTER THAN I DO.

25:55.154 --> 25:57.627
( laughs )

25:57.627 --> 26:00.329
- ARE YOU OKAY, LACEY?
- CONSIDERING EVERYTHING
THAT'S GOING ON,

26:00.329 --> 26:01.891
I'M JUST--
I'M TRYING TO BE NICE.

26:03.332 --> 26:06.235
HOW ABOUT
IF I FIND HIM, I'LL...

26:06.235 --> 26:08.768
FIND YOU?

26:08.768 --> 26:10.670
BUT I PROBABLY
WON'T FIND HIM, SO--

26:10.670 --> 26:12.171
( laughs )
'CAUSE WHY WOULD I FIND HIM?

26:12.171 --> 26:14.644
SO I HOPE YOU FIND HIM.
LET ME-- LEMME KNOW IF YOU--

26:14.644 --> 26:16.045
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

26:23.312 --> 26:27.887
( sighs )
OF COURSE I RAN
INTO JO AT THE DINER.

26:30.790 --> 26:33.262
SHE WAS LOOKING
FOR RICO, BUT I DOUBT
SHE SUSPECTED ANYTHING,

26:33.262 --> 26:36.996
BECAUSE... I WAS SMOOTH,
PLAYED IT COOL.

26:36.996 --> 26:38.768
( laughs )
THE FRIES SMELL GREAT.

26:38.768 --> 26:42.772
( sighs ) DANNY,
THE COPS ARE INTERVIEWING
ALL OF US, LOOKING FOR YOU.

26:42.772 --> 26:44.634
UH, IS THIS CHIEF MASTERSON,

26:44.634 --> 26:47.176
OR THE INVESTIGATOR WOMAN,
MARILYN ROSSI?

26:47.176 --> 26:48.678
ROSSI MOSTLY.

26:48.678 --> 26:50.309
I'M REALLY HOPING
CHIEF MASTERSON

26:50.309 --> 26:52.141
IS RUNNING
WITH THE STUFF I GAVE HIM.

26:52.141 --> 26:53.943
I MEAN GETTING YOU OFF
FOR REGINA'S MURDER

26:53.943 --> 26:55.645
GETS YOU OFF
FOR EVERYTHING.

26:55.645 --> 26:57.687
AND I FEEL
LIKE REGINA'S MOTHER
KNOWS SOMETHING.

26:59.649 --> 27:03.122
- JO.
- YEAH, I PUT IT TOGETHER.

27:04.393 --> 27:06.796
YOU KNOW THIS IS CRAZY,
RIGHT, DANNY?

27:06.796 --> 27:08.698
YOU MIGHT'VE MENTIONED THAT.

27:08.698 --> 27:11.400
AND YOU KNOW I COULD
CALL MY DAD RIGHT NOW
OR RICO'S MOM.

27:11.400 --> 27:14.403
YEAH.
I MEAN, YOU COULD.

27:14.403 --> 27:16.265
AND YOU HAVE,
BUT YOU CAN'T.

27:16.265 --> 27:18.768
JO, I'M BEING FRAMED.

27:18.768 --> 27:20.670
MARILYN USED TO WORK
FOR MY FATHER.

27:20.670 --> 27:24.073
SO YOU'RE SAYING YOUR FATHER
IS FRAMING YOU FOR MURDER?

27:24.073 --> 27:25.414
YES, WE'RE BOTH SAYING IT.

27:25.414 --> 27:28.117
HOW CAN YOU THINK THAT?
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

27:30.680 --> 27:32.421
BECAUSE HE DID IT BEFORE.

27:39.358 --> 27:40.830
I DIDN'T KILL MY AUNT.

27:40.830 --> 27:42.862
I'VE NEVER KILLED ANYONE.

27:42.862 --> 27:44.894
( stammers )

27:44.894 --> 27:47.767
NO. NO, WE SAW YOU
WITH THE JUMP ROPE.

27:47.767 --> 27:49.138
- YOU SAID YOU DID IT.
- I LIED.

27:49.138 --> 27:51.901
FIVE YEARS IN JUVIE?
( scoffs )

27:51.901 --> 27:53.442
TAKING THIS ABUSE
FOR SOMETHING YOU DIDN'T DO?

27:53.442 --> 27:55.304
DANNY, IT JUST
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

27:55.304 --> 27:57.947
- SHE'S RIGHT, IT DOESN'T.
- I COULDN'T SAY ANYTHING.

27:59.048 --> 28:01.110
THERE WAS
TOO MUCH AT STAKE.

28:01.110 --> 28:03.682
I FEEL LIKE
THERE'S A LOT MORE
AT STAKE RIGHT NOW.

28:04.784 --> 28:07.957
I-- I GOT HOME EARLY

28:07.957 --> 28:09.358
THAT AFTERNOON.

28:09.358 --> 28:12.421
YOU GUYS WERE ALREADY
PLAYING IN THE BACKYARD.

28:37.286 --> 28:39.148
I REMEMBER
HOW CALM HE WAS.

28:40.820 --> 28:42.021
DIDN'T EVEN HESITATE.

28:42.021 --> 28:45.724
HE JUST BENT DOWN,
HE PUT THE JUMP ROPE
IN MY HAND

28:45.724 --> 28:47.396
AND HE SAID
I HAD TO DO IT.

28:47.396 --> 28:49.999
THAT IF THE POLICE
FOUND OUT,

28:49.999 --> 28:52.461
THEY WERE GONNA
TAKE HIM AWAY FROM ME,
FROM MY MOTHER,

28:52.461 --> 28:54.103
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

28:54.103 --> 28:56.165
AND YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT IT WAS LIKE.

28:58.737 --> 29:01.771
I WAS SCARED.
I WAS NUMB.

29:02.912 --> 29:05.744
AND I LOVED HIM
SO MUCH.

29:09.178 --> 29:11.781
I'D DO ANYTHING FOR HIM.
HE WAS MY FATHER.

29:14.984 --> 29:17.787
HE TOLD ME I WAS JUST A KID.
THEY WOULDN'T PUT ME IN JAIL--

29:17.787 --> 29:19.458
A FEW MONTHS MAX,
I'D BE OUT.

29:20.960 --> 29:23.863
HE JUST KEPT ON SAYING,
"PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE."

29:23.863 --> 29:25.464
- Lacey: DANNY.
- FOR HIM.

29:26.495 --> 29:28.968
FOR ALL OF US,
ESPECIALLY YOU.

29:30.169 --> 29:32.201
- I--
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

29:34.974 --> 29:37.176
I DIDN'T EITHER.
SOMETHING ABOUT MY--

29:37.176 --> 29:38.948
MY AUNT TARA
KNOWING SECRETS.

29:38.948 --> 29:42.111
DANNY, A FEW MONTHS
BECAME FIVE YEARS.

29:43.152 --> 29:44.814
AT FIRST,
HE STOPPED VISITING.

29:46.055 --> 29:47.786
AND THAT HURT.

29:48.918 --> 29:50.820
AND THEN HE DISAPPEARED.

29:50.820 --> 29:54.093
AND WHEN I GOT OUT,
I COULDN'T SAY ANYTHING.

29:54.093 --> 29:56.896
BECAUSE THE ONE WITNESS,
MY FATHER,

29:56.896 --> 29:58.367
WAS APPARENTLY DEAD.

30:00.199 --> 30:03.002
AND THEN REGINA GOT MURDERED
AND SOMEBODY WAS FRAMING ME

30:03.002 --> 30:04.503
AND I JUST
COULDN'T FIGURE OUT WHO.

30:04.503 --> 30:06.435
UNTIL YOU HEARD
YOUR FATHER WAS ALIVE.

30:06.435 --> 30:08.807
YEAH, I KINDA
PUT IT TOGETHER.

30:08.807 --> 30:12.281
HE MADE ME TAKE
THE BLAME FOR MY AUNT,

30:12.281 --> 30:14.813
AND THEN HE FRAMED ME
FOR REGINA.

30:14.813 --> 30:16.815
- Lacey: OH MY GOD,
THE POLICE ARE HERE.
- ( people chattering )

30:16.815 --> 30:20.419
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHERE HE IS AND YOU
HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING.

30:20.419 --> 30:23.953
- NO.
- OKAY, I'M GONNA
GO HELP STALL THEM.

30:23.953 --> 30:25.054
THERE'S A WINDOW
IN THE BATHROOM.

30:25.054 --> 30:26.595
HELP HIM
GET OUT OF HERE, JO.

30:26.595 --> 30:28.827
YOU NEED TO GO
DOWNSTAIRS AND TURN
YOURSELF IN RIGHT NOW.

30:28.827 --> 30:31.460
- I CAN'T.
- DANNY, MY DAD'LL BELIEVE YOU.

30:31.460 --> 30:34.403
HE MIGHT, BUT OTHER PEOPLE,
THEY'RE GONNA NEED PROOF.

30:34.403 --> 30:37.236
I NEED TO FIND HIM.

30:37.236 --> 30:38.607
HOW IS THAT EVEN POSSIBLE?

30:38.607 --> 30:40.870
I HAVE AN IDEA...

30:42.511 --> 30:44.073
BUT I NEED YOUR HELP.

30:46.275 --> 30:48.547
IT WAS CLOSE
TO 100,000 CASH.

30:48.547 --> 30:50.980
A LOT OF MONEY TO PAY
AN INVESTIGATOR.

30:50.980 --> 30:53.552
TAKE A LOOK.
VIKRAM'S DUMMY ACCOUNT--

30:53.552 --> 30:55.885
EIGHT WITHDRAWALS
ADDING UP TO 100,000.

30:55.885 --> 30:58.327
SAME ACCOUNT THAT THE MONEY
TO PAY REGINA CAME FROM.

30:58.327 --> 31:00.890
SO VIKRAM WAS BEING
BLACKMAILED BY REGINA.

31:00.890 --> 31:02.431
AND THIS MONEY,
THE 100,000--

31:02.431 --> 31:04.894
IT WAS COMPENSATION FOR
SOMETHING A WHOLE LOT BIGGER.

31:05.965 --> 31:07.496
AND ALL ROADS
LEAD TO MARILYN.

31:08.898 --> 31:11.170
MORE LIKE ALL ROADS
LEAD TO VIKRAM.

31:12.641 --> 31:15.474
VIKRAM, IT'S ME AGAIN.
WHY AREN'T YOU PICKING UP?

31:15.474 --> 31:18.007
YOU SAID YOU WERE
GONNA COME FORWARD.

31:18.007 --> 31:20.049
YOU HAVE TO AND SOON.

31:21.981 --> 31:24.313
I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH
LONGER I CAN KEEP QUIET.

31:25.414 --> 31:26.986
PLEASE.

31:27.987 --> 31:29.088
AT LEAST CALL ME BACK.

31:33.993 --> 31:36.966
I WANT A FULL REPORT
OF ALL PLACES SEARCHED

31:36.966 --> 31:38.928
AND PLACES LEFT TO SEARCH.

31:40.029 --> 31:41.300
Marilyn:
TOMORROW?

31:42.301 --> 31:43.973
TRY YESTERDAY.

31:44.633 --> 31:46.375
MISS ROSSI.

31:48.477 --> 31:50.209
I'M JO MASTERSON.

31:50.209 --> 31:51.941
I KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

31:56.645 --> 31:58.517
I KNOW WHERE DANNY IS.

32:00.019 --> 32:02.992
- GO ON.
- WELL...

32:02.992 --> 32:06.055
HE WANTS
TO GIVE HIMSELF UP.

32:07.096 --> 32:08.227
THEN HE SHOULD.

32:09.428 --> 32:11.400
HE WANTS TO SEE
HIS FATHER FIRST.

32:11.400 --> 32:12.701
HIS FATHER IS DEAD.

32:16.235 --> 32:18.067
WELL, DANNY DOESN'T
BELIEVE THAT.

32:18.067 --> 32:20.109
HE THINKS THAT--

32:20.109 --> 32:21.570
HE THINKS THAT
YOU WORK FOR HIS FATHER

32:21.570 --> 32:23.112
AND THAT YOU'LL ARRANGE
A MEETING BETWEEN THEM.

32:25.444 --> 32:27.016
I COULD ALSO
JUST ARREST HIM.

32:32.421 --> 32:34.053
HE'LL TAKE THAT CHANCE.

32:56.705 --> 32:58.147
Jack: CHECKED OUT
ALL HIS OLD HAUNTS.

32:58.147 --> 33:00.309
PLACES I KNEW ABOUT
AND PLACES I HEARD ABOUT--

33:00.309 --> 33:02.711
ADDRESSES, BOATS,
A STORAGE LOCKER
DOWN AT THE WHARF.

33:03.152 --> 33:05.384
NO ONE'S SEEN HIM, KAREN.

33:05.384 --> 33:07.986
ARE YOU SURE THERE'S REALLY
A CHANCE HE'S STILL ALIVE?

33:07.986 --> 33:09.718
I WOULDN'T HAVE COME
TO YOU IF THERE WASN'T.

33:09.718 --> 33:12.021
HMM. YOU KNOW, I--

33:13.062 --> 33:14.693
I GET DANNY.

33:16.095 --> 33:17.996
DO YOU REALLY CARE
ABOUT VIKRAM?

33:17.996 --> 33:19.368
OF COURSE.

33:20.369 --> 33:22.201
I CARE.

33:22.201 --> 33:24.002
HE'S MY HUSBAND.

33:24.002 --> 33:26.235
HE WAS YOUR HUSBAND
WHEN WE WERE...

33:27.336 --> 33:29.108
TOGETHER.

33:29.108 --> 33:30.309
THAT WAS
A LONG TIME AGO--

33:30.309 --> 33:32.010
YEARS AND YEARS
AND YEARS--

33:32.010 --> 33:36.045
AND... WE BOTH
MOVED ON WITH OUR LIVES.

33:36.045 --> 33:38.047
OR TRIED.

33:43.192 --> 33:44.123
( sighs )

33:47.156 --> 33:48.397
WHAT'S THAT?

33:50.028 --> 33:52.701
JUST SOME JUNK
FROM A STORAGE LOCKER OF HIS--

33:52.701 --> 33:54.663
PAPER, LEGAL STUFF.

33:54.663 --> 33:56.665
A LOT OF WATER DAMAGE,
I THINK.

33:58.207 --> 34:00.109
HE'S NOT
IN THE BOX, KAREN.

34:00.109 --> 34:01.370
I CHECKED

34:03.112 --> 34:05.174
WE HAVE TO GET THIS
TO THE POLICE.

34:10.079 --> 34:12.681
- YOU MUST BE EXHAUSTED.
- HAS EDDIE CALLED?

34:12.681 --> 34:14.523
NO. WHAT'S GOING ON?

34:14.523 --> 34:16.255
I TOLD HIM TO CALL
ONLY ON THE HOME LINE.

34:16.255 --> 34:20.089
- WHERE'S JO?
- SHE TEXTED.
SHE'S STUDYING WITH RICO.

34:20.089 --> 34:23.132
VIKRAM ALIVE IS
JUST SO UNTHINKABLE.

34:23.132 --> 34:26.335
- ( phone ringing )
- SOMETIMES UNTHINKABLE
IS GOOD THINKING.

34:29.268 --> 34:31.240
- ( beeps )
- HELLO?

34:33.242 --> 34:35.104
GOOD WORK, EDDIE.
I'LL MEET YOU THERE.

34:35.104 --> 34:36.575
WHAT'S GOING ON?

34:36.575 --> 34:38.747
EVIDENCE THAT
THE LAB RESULTS
WERE TAMPERED WITH.

34:38.747 --> 34:41.180
DANNY'S PRINTS ARE NOT
ON THAT MURDER WEAPON.

34:43.552 --> 34:47.085
( door opens, closes )

34:49.188 --> 34:53.091
♪ GOODBYE,
OUR WINDOW OF MERCY... ♪

34:53.091 --> 34:54.563
HI, BIG GUY.

34:54.563 --> 34:56.094
Charlie:
HE LIKES YOU.

34:57.666 --> 35:00.098
- YOU AGAIN.
- ( both laugh )

35:00.098 --> 35:01.830
YEAH, THE FAMILY
I'M STAYING WITH,

35:01.830 --> 35:03.832
THEY'RE BIG
ON ME EARNING MY KEEP.

35:03.832 --> 35:07.676
YOU KNOW, THAT WHOLE THING
ABOUT IDLE HANDS.

35:09.338 --> 35:12.741
- THIS GUY YOURS?
- HALF MINE.

35:12.741 --> 35:14.213
REGINA AND I SHARED HIM.

35:15.214 --> 35:17.146
REGINA?
THAT'S THE GIRL

35:17.146 --> 35:18.587
THIS DANNY GUY
IS ACCUSED OF--

35:18.587 --> 35:19.788
BUT DIDN'T.

35:20.889 --> 35:22.791
THAT'S HOW THEY MADE IT
SOUND ON THE NEWS.

35:23.892 --> 35:26.655
( sighs ) I WAS LOOKING
FOR REGINA'S MOTHER.

35:26.655 --> 35:29.198
I CALLED HER HOUSE
AND THEY SAID SHE WAS HERE.

35:29.198 --> 35:31.660
YEAH YEAH,
YOU JUST MISSED HER
BY ABOUT A HALF HOUR.

35:31.660 --> 35:32.801
OH.

35:32.801 --> 35:34.333
WHAT YOU WANNA TALK
TO HER ABOUT?

35:37.906 --> 35:40.469
WELL, SHE'S NOT HERE,
SO I'D BETTER GET GOING.

35:42.140 --> 35:43.642
LISTEN, IF THERE'S
ANYTHING I CAN DO,

35:43.642 --> 35:46.915
YOU KNOW, MAYBE MENTION
THAT YOU WERE HERE OR--

35:46.915 --> 35:48.777
YEAH, FINE.
THAT'D BE GREAT. THANKS.

35:55.924 --> 35:59.828
AH. ARE YOU
UP HERE ON THE WALL
OF FAME AND SHAME?

35:59.828 --> 36:02.491
( chuckles )
IN A COUPLE PLACES.

36:02.491 --> 36:05.634
MMM. CRANE LADY'S
ALL OVER IT, HUH?

36:05.634 --> 36:08.166
YEAH, HER FAMILY
GREW UP ON HORSES.

36:09.268 --> 36:11.600
THAT'S GLORIA
AND REGINA RIGHT THERE.

36:11.600 --> 36:13.242
AND THAT'S ME AND REGINA.

36:16.205 --> 36:19.177
GOD. I'D FORGOTTEN
DANNY'S FATHER WAS
A BIG RIDER, TOO.

36:19.177 --> 36:20.309
THAT'S HIM WITH GLORIA.

36:22.751 --> 36:23.852
THAT'S FUNNY.

36:23.852 --> 36:25.954
I ASSUMED
THAT WAS HER HUSBAND.

36:29.458 --> 36:32.521
NO. JUST FRIENDS.

36:42.871 --> 36:44.873
( door creaking )

36:45.874 --> 36:46.975
JO, WHAT ARE
YOU DOING HERE?

36:46.975 --> 36:48.577
I DON'T KNOW WHICH WAY
SHE'S GONNA GO--

36:48.577 --> 36:50.239
THE POLICE OR VIKRAM.

36:50.239 --> 36:52.281
I'M JUST--
I'M SCARED FOR YOU.

36:52.281 --> 36:53.442
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

36:53.442 --> 36:54.883
I'M DONE RUNNING, JO.

36:54.883 --> 36:57.586
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER,
IT ENDS TONIGHT.

36:59.588 --> 37:00.949
WELL, THEN I'LL STAY, TOO.
I WON'T GO.

37:00.949 --> 37:02.821
NO, YOU CAN'T. COME ON.

37:02.821 --> 37:03.852
- DANNY, I CAN'T--
- YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND, JO.

37:03.852 --> 37:04.923
( door creaking )

37:14.333 --> 37:15.564
HELLO, SON.

37:22.010 --> 37:24.773
THAT WAS SMART,
GOING TO MARILYN.

37:24.773 --> 37:26.675
SHE'S BEEN
HELPING ME FIND YOU.

37:26.675 --> 37:28.347
FIND ME OR FRAME ME?

37:28.347 --> 37:29.518
DANNY, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

37:29.518 --> 37:32.381
- YOU'RE RIGHT, I DON'T.
- I HAD TO STAY DEAD.

37:32.381 --> 37:34.523
PEOPLE WERE
TRYING TO KILL ME.
THEY STILL ARE.

37:34.523 --> 37:36.625
I DON'T CARE, OKAY?!

37:37.656 --> 37:40.689
YOU'RE LYING,
LIKE YOU LIE
ABOUT EVERYTHING!

37:40.689 --> 37:44.032
JO, LOOK AT ME.
I NEED YOU TO GO, OKAY?

37:44.032 --> 37:45.964
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

37:49.338 --> 37:50.639
( gasps )

37:53.642 --> 37:56.505
SHE KNOWS.
I TOLD HER...

37:56.505 --> 37:58.507
HOW I TOOK THE JUMP ROPE,

37:58.507 --> 38:00.609
HOW I TOOK THE BLAME.

38:01.880 --> 38:03.952
WHEN YOU'RE A KID,
YOU GET IT.

38:03.952 --> 38:05.984
YOU UNDERSTAND THIS MAN,
YOUR FATHER,

38:05.984 --> 38:07.516
EXPLAINS IT TO YOU.

38:08.517 --> 38:10.459
AND HE'S THIS AMAZING MAN.

38:10.459 --> 38:12.461
AND YOU LOVE HIM

38:12.461 --> 38:13.592
AND YOU LOOK UP TO HIM.

38:13.592 --> 38:16.024
- I'M BACK NOW, SON.
- NO.

38:18.367 --> 38:20.699
WE CAN GO AWAY,
TOGETHER.

38:21.900 --> 38:23.602
WE'LL DISAPPEAR,

38:23.602 --> 38:25.634
START OUR LIVES OVER.

38:27.706 --> 38:29.708
AND YOU WANT THAT
FOR HIM, RIGHT, JO?

38:29.708 --> 38:33.712
NO. NO.
DON'T YOU TALK TO HER!

38:33.712 --> 38:35.714
I'M NOT RUNNING AWAY!
I'VE BEEN HIDING

38:35.714 --> 38:38.417
FOR FIVE YEARS
BEHIND A LIE!

38:39.518 --> 38:40.949
AND WHEN
I GOT OUT OF JUVIE

38:40.949 --> 38:42.421
AND YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO BE DEAD,

38:42.421 --> 38:44.453
ALL I WANTED WAS
A SECOND CHANCE.

38:46.795 --> 38:48.597
AND NOW I'M RUNNING
FROM THE POLICE,

38:48.597 --> 38:52.401
I'M BEING FRAMED,
AND IT'S YOU, DAD.

38:53.762 --> 38:55.664
IT'S YOU.
JUST ADMIT IT.

38:55.664 --> 38:58.106
EVERYTHING I DID
IS FOR A GOOD REASON.

38:58.106 --> 39:01.540
- OUR LIVES WERE AT STAKE.
- WHOSE LIVES? WHAT LIVES?!

39:01.540 --> 39:03.512
Vikram:
EVERYONE WHO'S
CLOSE TO YOU, DANNY!

39:03.512 --> 39:06.375
NOW YOU NEED
TO LISTEN TO ME NOW!
I AM YOUR FATHER!

39:06.375 --> 39:08.777
- YOU WILL DESTROY EVERYTHING!
- Danny: NO! NO!

39:08.777 --> 39:10.749
I'M JUST GONNA RUIN YOU.

39:12.080 --> 39:15.353
YOU NEED TO PAY
FOR WHAT YOU DID TO ME.

39:15.353 --> 39:17.926
AND YOU NEED TO KEEP
YOUR MOUTH SHUT!

39:17.926 --> 39:19.628
( beeps )

39:19.628 --> 39:22.591
NO, JO, DON'T--
DANNY, GET OFF ME, DAMN IT!

39:30.539 --> 39:32.941
GIVE ME THAT PHONE!

39:36.675 --> 39:38.677
( police radio chatter )

39:44.082 --> 39:45.984
MANAGER SAYS
SHE HASN'T CHECKED OUT.

39:48.687 --> 39:50.388
LET'S GO.

39:59.397 --> 40:00.729
POLICE, OPEN UP!

40:07.476 --> 40:08.537
CLEAR.

40:10.509 --> 40:12.180
SHE'S GONE.

40:51.620 --> 40:53.482
( rustles )

40:56.825 --> 40:58.757
( yelps, gasps )

40:58.757 --> 41:00.458
( panting )

41:09.738 --> 41:11.600
YOU LITTLE BITCH!

41:11.600 --> 41:14.903
- DON'T TOUCH HER!
- DANNY, GET OFF!

41:20.579 --> 41:22.050
YOU KNOW,
THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT.

41:25.784 --> 41:27.155
( both grunt )

41:44.773 --> 41:46.805
( thuds )
