CHARLIE: So, you found Elizabeth
in the kitchen?

02:36.320 --> 02:38.439
WOMAN: Ah, yes. Yes, I did.
I was terrified!

02:38.440 --> 02:40.999
To think that this could happen
in my neighbourhood!

02:41.000 --> 02:43.359
Right.
Mrs Gilmore, you were telling me...

02:43.360 --> 02:45.039
I was in my backyard and...

02:45.040 --> 02:48.639
Mrs Gilmore, you were telling me
about Elizabeth's mother, Mrs...

02:48.640 --> 02:50.559
Oh. Judith. Yes, Mrs Chapman.

02:50.560 --> 02:52.439
Her husband's Laurie Chapman.

02:52.440 --> 02:54.879
I presume he's at work,
at the moment,

02:54.880 --> 02:57.039
although he hardly
needs to work anymore.

Chapman house. Sergeant Davis.

(Whispers) Listen up
if you want to see her alive.

03:15.040 --> 03:17.599
Who is this?
I said listen.

03:17.600 --> 03:19.559
Judith's been kidnapped.

03:19.560 --> 03:22.599
She's gonna be chopped up
unless I get 50,000 quid.

03:22.600 --> 03:25.759
Is Mrs Chapman alright? I need...
Shut up!

03:25.760 --> 03:27.719
I'll call at three o'clock
with instructions.

03:27.720 --> 03:30.600
Hold on, please! Three o'clock?
(Hangs up)

03:31.880 --> 03:33.440
Hello?

03:40.720 --> 03:42.239
It's beautiful, Jean.

03:42.240 --> 03:43.799
Just wondering, though...
Mmm?

03:43.800 --> 03:47.399
This little chap here,
do you think he needs repotting?

03:47.400 --> 03:50.199
Hmm... You're getting
quite good at this.

03:50.200 --> 03:53.119
Well, I've learnt from the best.
Is that right?

03:53.120 --> 03:55.399
Yes.

03:55.400 --> 03:57.679
And the name of this one is...?

03:57.680 --> 04:01.439
Well, of course, yes, that would be
the, um... well, that's your

04:01.440 --> 04:03.919
typical, garden variety,

04:03.920 --> 04:06.360
velvety-petalled, spotted...

04:07.360 --> 04:08.999
...hydrangea thing.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.119
I think you should
stick to medicine.

04:11.120 --> 04:12.640
Maybe I should.

04:19.120 --> 04:20.759
(Phone rings)
I'll get that.

04:20.760 --> 04:25.600
No, no, no. You've got
your hands full. I'll, um...

Judith Chapman,
wife of Laurie Chapman.

04:48.160 --> 04:51.239
THE Laurie Chapman.
The lottery winner?

04:51.240 --> 04:52.680
Very same.

04:57.600 --> 04:59.839
We're trying to locate
the next of kin.

04:59.840 --> 05:01.400
Right.

05:04.520 --> 05:08.159
£50,000, that's...
that's a lot of money.

05:08.160 --> 05:11.079
Mmm. And this bloke wants all of it.

05:11.080 --> 05:14.319
Not enough here to suggest
he's dead, I would've thought.

05:14.320 --> 05:16.999
No, there's no
arterial spray pattern.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.639
This suggests more of
a superficial wound.

05:19.640 --> 05:21.919
But this is odd, Frank.

05:21.920 --> 05:23.879
The blood here,

05:23.880 --> 05:27.799
it's lying in intact
or complete drops.

05:27.800 --> 05:31.559
In other words,
the blood has landed on the knife.

05:31.560 --> 05:33.799
You mean after the knife
was already on the floor?

05:33.800 --> 05:38.119
Exactly, yes. We'll get it Dr Harvey
after you've checked for prints.

05:38.120 --> 05:39.879
Everything still in place
for three o'clock?

05:39.880 --> 05:41.679
Yes, sir -
I've spoken to the exchange

05:41.680 --> 05:43.879
and I'll be there
when the kidnapper calls.

05:43.880 --> 05:45.720
OK, good. Good work.

05:48.160 --> 05:52.519
Elizabeth, in the kitchen,
you didn't cut yourself

05:52.520 --> 05:55.160
on any of those broken plates,
did you?

05:56.680 --> 05:58.279
No? That's good.

05:58.280 --> 06:01.559
I tell you what,
you're being very, very brave

06:01.560 --> 06:05.439
and I get the feeling
you might be very, very clever too.

06:05.440 --> 06:08.479
Wouldn't you say, Frank?
Oh, I think she's very clever.

06:08.480 --> 06:12.319
Yes, so I need you to do something
for us. I need you to think.

06:12.320 --> 06:17.839
Have there been any other unusual
telephone calls?

06:17.840 --> 06:21.199
No? And Mummy hasn't had
any arguments,

06:21.200 --> 06:25.599
perhaps at the shops or...
or at your school?

06:25.600 --> 06:28.079
No, sir.

06:28.080 --> 06:29.519
No.

06:29.520 --> 06:35.279
And apart from in the kitchen, have
you seen or noticed anything unusual,

06:35.280 --> 06:36.759
anything at all?

06:36.760 --> 06:40.919
Mrs Gilmore usually
shouts at me over the fence

06:40.920 --> 06:43.039
but today she came in.

06:43.040 --> 06:47.079
She said she was coming to complain
about a stick banging on her fence.

06:47.080 --> 06:52.599
Oh. Well, I'm sure your father
will be here very, very soon.

06:52.600 --> 06:55.440
I just want my mum.

07:13.240 --> 07:15.439
G'day, fellas.
Chief Superintendent Carlyle.

07:15.440 --> 07:18.119
This is Dr Blake.
We're looking for Laurie Chapman.

07:18.120 --> 07:21.719
Either of you know where he is?
He's not in his office?

07:21.720 --> 07:25.399
Then, no, sorry.
Did he come in today?

07:25.400 --> 07:26.839
He must've gone out.

07:26.840 --> 07:29.799
We'll get him to call the station.
Kick her in the guts, mate.

07:29.800 --> 07:31.919
Sure.
Hang on, hang on.

07:31.920 --> 07:33.519
I'm not done with you two yet.

07:33.520 --> 07:35.279
Laurie's a good bloke.
Leave him alone.

07:35.280 --> 07:37.080
Right! Back here!

07:38.280 --> 07:40.920
Names. Now.

07:41.640 --> 07:44.360
Weston. Cliff Weston.

07:45.640 --> 07:47.639
Tom O'Reilly.

07:47.640 --> 07:49.680
What time did Laurie leave?

07:52.600 --> 07:56.119
Laurie's not in any trouble.
This is an urgent family matter.

07:56.120 --> 08:00.159
Now, do either of you know him well?
I went to school with him.

08:00.160 --> 08:02.599
And we all played footy with him
and we worked with him.

08:02.600 --> 08:04.439
He used to be a mechanic
here with us.

08:04.440 --> 08:06.080
Right. Do you know his wife, Judith?

08:07.840 --> 08:11.639
No? Do you have any idea
where he might be?

08:11.640 --> 08:13.439
This really is an emergency.

08:13.440 --> 08:15.679
You could try the Bendigo office.

08:15.680 --> 08:17.920
Wasn't that hard, now, was it?

08:21.160 --> 08:24.519
Grew up on Grimstead Street.
Wrong side of the tracks.

08:24.520 --> 08:28.159
Champion footy player.
Played VFL. Retired due to injury.

08:28.160 --> 08:31.199
Did his knee.
Tough as nails, Laurie Chapman.

08:31.200 --> 08:34.359
Yes, that's great. Have we had
the pleasure of his company before?

08:34.360 --> 08:37.799
No, sir, not even as a kid.
Moved to this address a year ago.

08:37.799 --> 08:40.279
What about the neighbour?
Has she been any more help?

08:40.280 --> 08:42.999
Not really, even after Davis
told her he was a sergeant,

08:43.000 --> 08:44.639
not just a constable.

08:44.640 --> 08:47.199
Lucien, we may need
your bedside manner on this.

08:47.200 --> 08:50.439
Of course.
What do we know about her family?

08:50.440 --> 08:53.439
Charlie's tracking down her mother,
Irene Henderson.

08:53.440 --> 08:54.999
And the knife?

08:55.000 --> 08:57.199
We compared the prints to
samples from the house.

08:57.200 --> 08:59.559
All Mrs Chapman's.

08:59.560 --> 09:01.079
(Phone rings)

09:01.080 --> 09:02.719
Hello? Ballarat Police.

09:02.720 --> 09:06.919
No-one's talking, no prints
and, thanks to this bloody rag,

09:06.920 --> 09:08.599
no shortage of suspects.

09:08.600 --> 09:10.359
Hmm. Lucky Laurie.

09:10.360 --> 09:13.400
'Ballarat's own Laurie Chapman
from...'

09:15.320 --> 09:18.279
Oh, for the love of God.
They printed his address!

09:18.280 --> 09:21.279
Anyone in Ballarat could've done it!
Anyone in the state.

09:21.280 --> 09:22.719
The Bendigo office called.

09:22.720 --> 09:25.719
Laurie Chapman didn't go to the
meeting today, he called in sick.

09:25.720 --> 09:27.480
Circulate his rego and details.

09:28.640 --> 09:31.840
A message for you, Doc.
Thank you, Ned.

09:34.320 --> 09:36.040
Wonderful.

09:37.400 --> 09:41.519
A knife? Normally at least
I get a body to work with.

09:41.520 --> 09:44.399
Well, let's be thankful
there isn't a body this time.

09:44.400 --> 09:47.439
I completed the blood
agglutination test, as you asked.

09:47.440 --> 09:50.999
It's type O.
Right. Which is very common.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.359
However, Judith it type B.

09:53.360 --> 09:57.999
It might be the kidnapper's blood.
Perhaps. Maybe she stabbed at them.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.239
I found something else on the blade.

10:00.240 --> 10:04.599
Intracellular protein structure
is, what...

10:04.600 --> 10:06.159
Is cooked?!

10:06.160 --> 10:08.679
Well, then it can't be...
Human.

10:08.680 --> 10:10.239
Hopefully not.

10:10.240 --> 10:13.919
Oh, the bloody ham.
You sure there's no other tissue?

10:13.920 --> 10:15.439
Nothing that's not cooked.

10:15.440 --> 10:17.919
Well, Judith definitely drew blood,
so we're looking for someone with...

10:17.920 --> 10:19.800
Scratches, a cut lip.

10:20.840 --> 10:22.680
Yes. But who?

10:26.920 --> 10:28.639
(Footsteps approach)

10:28.640 --> 10:32.319
Mrs Gilmore, how do you do?
Oh!

10:32.320 --> 10:35.439
Allow me to introduce myself.
Dr Lucien Blake, Police Surgeon.

10:35.440 --> 10:40.039
Oh, how lovely to meet you, Doctor.
Oh, the pleasure is all mine.

10:40.040 --> 10:43.279
Er, Sergeant Davis has been telling
me what a wonderful help you've been.

10:43.280 --> 10:46.440
Oh! I do what I can!
Yes. Of course.

10:47.680 --> 10:50.839
Such unpleasant business
for this lovely area.

10:50.840 --> 10:54.319
Well, unpleasant but... Yes.
Yes.

10:54.320 --> 10:56.279
Not what you'd be used to
around here.

10:56.280 --> 10:58.759
Oh, not in the past, no.
No.

10:58.760 --> 11:01.160
Tell me, how long have
the Chapmans been here?

11:03.040 --> 11:07.319
Well, the Chapmans are not really
of this neighbourhood.

11:07.320 --> 11:08.519
Really?

11:08.520 --> 11:10.759
Yes, I mean, Mrs Chapman
is somewhat common

11:10.760 --> 11:14.240
and her husband's
an ex-football player.

11:16.120 --> 11:19.999
Yes. Fair to say you don't really
like the Chapmans?

11:20.000 --> 11:22.839
Oh, no, I... Oh! No.
I wouldn't say that.

11:22.840 --> 11:27.359
But they're trouble.
They attract a different type.

11:27.360 --> 11:31.639
Look, just last week,
Mrs Chapman was arguing out here

11:31.640 --> 11:33.400
with a very rough-looking fellow.

11:35.160 --> 11:38.439
Brownish hair, unshaven?

11:38.440 --> 11:41.279
Do you recall seeing anyone else,

11:41.280 --> 11:43.759
anyone loitering in the street
causing trouble?

11:43.760 --> 11:45.439
No.
(Door closes)

11:45.440 --> 11:47.359
(Sighs)

11:47.360 --> 11:50.480
Different type, like I said.

11:52.240 --> 11:55.120
The apple doesn't fall very far
from the tree.

12:00.440 --> 12:04.839
Give me a hug, sweetie!
Don't you worry, Bethy, darl!

12:04.840 --> 12:07.479
Granny's here and you'll be alright.

12:07.480 --> 12:10.679
Mrs Henderson, we are actually
waiting on another call, so...

12:10.680 --> 12:13.519
BILL: Got everything you need, love?
My books.

12:13.520 --> 12:15.360
Books. Here we are.

12:16.760 --> 12:18.879
They're Mummy's.

12:18.880 --> 12:22.879
Oh. Anything else, Bethy, dear?
My toothbrush.

12:22.880 --> 12:24.999
Mum calls me Elizabeth.

12:25.000 --> 12:28.039
Oh. I'll get that.
It'll be in the kitchen.

12:28.040 --> 12:30.159
Don't touch anything in there.

12:30.160 --> 12:33.599
We keep our toothbrushes
in the bathroom.

12:33.600 --> 12:35.360
In the bathroom?

12:37.440 --> 12:38.919
Ah. Here we are.

12:38.920 --> 12:42.759
Now, which one's yours?
This one.

12:42.760 --> 12:44.320
I thought so.

12:59.400 --> 13:01.839
Judith has Addison's disease.

13:01.840 --> 13:05.199
Now, I'm no endocrinologist but
I do know a thing or two about it.

13:05.200 --> 13:08.519
The adrenal glands don't function,
there's a deficiency of cortisol

13:08.520 --> 13:11.359
so she needs regular doses
of steroids.

13:11.360 --> 13:13.520
Otherwise?
Otherwise she'll die.

13:14.520 --> 13:16.279
How long?

13:16.280 --> 13:18.439
Well, without her medication,
a day, maybe two.

13:18.440 --> 13:22.319
There's a steady decline, low blood
pressure, vomiting, convulsions,

13:22.320 --> 13:24.000
coma and death.

13:25.760 --> 13:28.159
Alright. You take the call.
Me?

13:28.160 --> 13:29.639
Well, Addison's disease,

13:29.640 --> 13:32.319
you know what you're talking about
far better than me.

13:32.320 --> 13:36.119
Also, the exchange
is gonna trace the call,

13:36.120 --> 13:37.839
as long as we don't hang up
at this end.

13:37.840 --> 13:39.599
They'll trace the lines back
to his phone

13:39.600 --> 13:41.679
regardless of whether
he hangs up or not

13:41.680 --> 13:44.439
but I need you to keep him talking
as long as possible.

13:44.440 --> 13:46.280
That way the...
(Phone rings)

13:57.000 --> 13:59.199
This is Dr Lucien Blake.
I'm with the police.

13:59.200 --> 14:03.599
(Whispers) I want £50,000
in two brown paper bags.

14:03.600 --> 14:08.759
Yes, but you need to know Judith has
a condition called Addison's disease.

14:08.760 --> 14:11.119
What?
Without her medication, she'll die.

14:11.120 --> 14:15.119
Now, please, just describe
her current condition for me.

14:15.120 --> 14:17.279
She's fine. Now, look...
Please listen.

14:17.280 --> 14:20.479
You need to get her some prednisone.
That's prednisone.

14:20.480 --> 14:23.479
Look, just ask her.
She'll tell you what she needs.

14:23.480 --> 14:27.799
Look, I tell YOU what to do, right?
Yes, yes, I understand.

14:27.800 --> 14:30.879
You really do need to get her some
prednisone from a chemist or a...

14:30.880 --> 14:32.439
I'm not doing that!

14:32.440 --> 14:36.999
If you don't do what I say, I'll
tie her down so she gets chopped up!

14:37.000 --> 14:38.679
Now, you listen to me.

14:38.680 --> 14:41.439
If she dies, there is no money.
Do you understand that?

14:41.440 --> 14:44.439
Now, you get the prednisone.
I'm not stupid!

14:44.440 --> 14:47.519
Get the money!
Alright, now, look...

14:47.520 --> 14:50.479
Hello? You there?

14:50.480 --> 14:53.759
Davis just radioed from the
exchange. It's a local phone box.

14:53.760 --> 14:55.679
Alright, go. Go.

14:55.680 --> 15:00.159
Very odd. He didn't say where
to leave the money.

15:00.160 --> 15:03.160
(Siren wails)

15:07.760 --> 15:09.360
(Brakes screech)

15:12.560 --> 15:14.199
Oh...

15:14.200 --> 15:16.200
(Sighs)

15:28.440 --> 15:31.199
He really has no idea
what he's doing.

15:31.200 --> 15:34.719
Total amateur.
Which makes him even more dangerous.

15:34.720 --> 15:37.320
Judith! Who are you?

15:38.520 --> 15:42.159
What do you mean 'missing'? I should
be out looking. You should be...

15:42.160 --> 15:44.759
We've got our best men out there
searching as we speak.

15:44.760 --> 15:47.679
The best thing you can do now
is answer a few questions.

15:47.680 --> 15:49.639
Oh, our daughter, Elizabeth!
Where's my daughter?

15:49.640 --> 15:52.040
She's currently staying
with her grandmother.

15:53.800 --> 15:57.719
Right. Tell us where you were
between 8:00am and 3:00 today.

15:57.720 --> 15:59.640
I was at work.

16:00.920 --> 16:05.279
Well, no, you weren't.You see,
we've already been down the depot.

16:05.280 --> 16:09.999
(Laughs) No, well, I was working,
just not at the depot.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.319
I had a meeting in... in Bendigo.

16:12.320 --> 16:15.840
Right. Was this the meeting
that you called in sick for?

16:17.440 --> 16:18.879
W-Well...

16:18.880 --> 16:21.320
You care to try again?

16:22.560 --> 16:26.839
Mr Chapman, please,
just tell us where you were.

16:26.840 --> 16:30.080
Then we can concentrate on other
leads and find your wife. Yes?

16:34.080 --> 16:35.559
I-I was with Dulcie.

16:35.560 --> 16:38.519
Dulcie have a second name?
Young. Dulcie Young.

16:38.520 --> 16:43.920
She's a conductress.
We went to Hepburn for a picnic.

16:45.640 --> 16:47.319
I see.

16:47.320 --> 16:51.239
So you were having an affair and
planning to run off with the money?

16:51.240 --> 16:53.039
No, I'm not running anywhere. OK?

16:53.040 --> 16:54.760
I don't even have the money.
Really?

16:56.760 --> 17:01.279
That's to advertise the lottery, OK?
This doesn't make any sense.

17:01.280 --> 17:02.799
You know what doesn't make sense?

17:02.800 --> 17:04.358
You just happen to work

17:04.359 --> 17:07.119
directly opposite the phone booth
where the ransom call was made.

17:08.800 --> 17:10.398
You care to explain that?

17:10.400 --> 17:12.240
I-I-I...

17:12.280 --> 17:15.239
I think it's best youaccompany
the Sr Sergeant down the station.

17:15.240 --> 17:16.679
What about Jude?
Don't worry.

17:16.680 --> 17:20.439
We'll keep someone here
just in case there is a call.

17:20.440 --> 17:23.359
We've only had the phone two days.

17:32.040 --> 17:34.439
Mr Weston?
Yeah?

17:34.440 --> 17:36.039
Cliff.

17:36.040 --> 17:38.880
Cliff, we're looking for Dulcie.
Over there.

17:40.880 --> 17:44.480
Dulcie Young?
That's my name. Don't wear it out.

17:46.440 --> 17:49.159
Chief Superintendent Carlyle.
This is Dr Blake.

17:49.160 --> 17:50.919
We're investigating
the kidnapping of Judith Chapman.

17:50.920 --> 17:53.719
What, you mean Laurie...
er, Mr Chapman's wife?

17:53.720 --> 17:55.479
Do you know Judith?

17:55.480 --> 17:58.479
Um, no. I've never met her.

17:58.480 --> 18:00.599
Where were you today
between 8:00am and 3:00?

18:00.600 --> 18:03.879
Not here. I was rostered on
for the evening shift.

18:03.880 --> 18:05.480
So where were you?

18:08.760 --> 18:11.919
Look, I really don't have time
but we can do this down the station.

18:11.920 --> 18:13.639
No, no. I... I can't. I'm...

18:13.640 --> 18:16.159
Dulcie, we're not here to judge you
or embarrass you.

18:16.160 --> 18:18.799
We're only interested in
finding Judith, alright?

18:18.800 --> 18:22.040
Now, you need to tell us the truth.

18:24.320 --> 18:25.800
I suppose he told you?

18:27.440 --> 18:29.000
Well, I suppose he had to.

18:30.440 --> 18:33.520
I was with Mr Chapman.Laurie.

18:34.640 --> 18:36.440
We've slept together.

18:38.120 --> 18:40.519
We're in love.
Right.

18:40.520 --> 18:43.359
Do you happen to have
his home telephone number?

18:43.360 --> 18:47.439
Um, no, but it's written on
his board in the office.

18:47.440 --> 18:50.079
Look, everybody likes Laurie.

18:50.080 --> 18:54.119
Laurie never sack anyone,
report them or complain?

18:54.120 --> 18:57.680
No. The only person he complained
about was his mother-in-law.

19:07.200 --> 19:09.439
All considered, Bethy's OK.

19:09.440 --> 19:13.599
Feeling cooped up, but I thought
it best to keep he indoors.

19:13.600 --> 19:16.359
The kids around here
are a bit tougher.

19:16.360 --> 19:20.199
Mrs Henderson, tell me, do you have
Laurie and Judith's phone number?

19:20.200 --> 19:24.319
Yeah, I've... I've got it
written down. Somewhere.

19:24.320 --> 19:27.119
Have you given that out to anyone
or ever used it yourself?

19:27.120 --> 19:28.919
No.

19:28.920 --> 19:32.599
We don't have a phone
and I prefer to pop around.

19:32.600 --> 19:34.799
Right. Since you've been back
in town, you mean?

19:34.800 --> 19:38.440
Tell me, was that before or after
they won the lottery?

19:40.640 --> 19:43.479
Are you suggesting
I kidnapped my own daughter?

19:43.480 --> 19:46.680
Oh, of course not, Mrs Henderson.
Just trying to ascertain the facts.

19:48.000 --> 19:51.439
I'd better be getting Bethy
something to eat.

19:51.440 --> 19:53.240
Good afternoon.

19:54.800 --> 19:59.679
Mrs Henderson, if I may, did you
and Judith have any disagreements?

19:59.680 --> 20:03.319
Oh, what's he been saying now?

20:03.320 --> 20:07.040
Well, we'd very much like to hear
your side of things. It's only fair.

20:10.840 --> 20:13.279
Jude and I had a tiff
every now and then,

20:13.280 --> 20:15.159
just like every mother and daughter.

20:15.160 --> 20:17.799
I'm happy
she's risen up in the world,

20:17.800 --> 20:20.480
but you can't forget
where you're from.

20:24.920 --> 20:27.079
I think it's time
to get the press involved.

20:27.080 --> 20:29.559
You think that's a good idea?
A public appeal could work.

20:29.560 --> 20:33.000
We need all eyes and ears on this.
Alright. I'll meet you there.

20:44.120 --> 20:45.600
Hey!

21:02.200 --> 21:04.479
PATRICK: Unfortunately,
I think it'll be

21:04.480 --> 21:06.439
totally out of the question.

21:06.440 --> 21:09.439
Oh, Frank.
No, no. Look, we're done here.

21:09.440 --> 21:11.919
I wanted a public appeal
but the answer is no,

21:11.920 --> 21:14.559
so if you'll excuse me,
I have a missing woman to find.

21:14.560 --> 21:18.319
Tomorrow's layout's almost finished.
Of course we'll help.

21:18.320 --> 21:22.439
Edward, I was just explaining
late changes cost us a fortune...

21:22.440 --> 21:26.319
As editor, I'm fully aware of
the costs involvedin the process.

21:26.320 --> 21:28.839
The press have a wider social role!
But our compositors...

21:28.840 --> 21:32.759
I imagine the Melbourne papers
are hammering on your door.

21:32.760 --> 21:35.999
Very loudly. We're hoping to find
her by tonight but just in case...

21:36.000 --> 21:38.439
You need a contingency plan.
Of course. Yes.

21:38.440 --> 21:42.359
Maybe a front page appeal will
give the locals the inside running.

21:42.360 --> 21:46.479
He didn't even ask for a front page!
Come with me, brief me.

21:46.480 --> 21:50.559
Edward, perhaps you could mention
her illness. She needs prednisone.

21:50.560 --> 21:53.439
I can spell that for you...
Rose, get the details off Blake.

21:53.440 --> 21:57.479
Frank, there was a potential suspect
outside Irene's after you left.

21:57.480 --> 22:01.600
Six-foot, stubble, brownish hair.
Right. I'll get Charlie onto that.

22:05.800 --> 22:11.559
Edward has lifted profits. He knows
how to follow up a good story.

22:11.560 --> 22:16.079
Yes, by doing things like printing
the lottery winner's address!

22:16.080 --> 22:17.839
Oh, for God's sake, Blake.

22:17.840 --> 22:20.679
The lottery gives ordinary people
something to aim for, Doctor.

22:20.680 --> 22:24.639
What ordinary people aim for
and what they can get

22:24.640 --> 22:27.279
are quite often two very,
very different things.

22:27.280 --> 22:28.759
This is all about greed.

22:28.760 --> 22:31.119
Everyone in their place.
Social order.

22:31.120 --> 22:33.999
You sound very conservative today,
Doctor.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.440
(Sighs) Do I?

22:38.080 --> 22:41.039
Not all change is good,
Miss Anderson.

22:41.040 --> 22:45.560
Now, scribble this down for me.
Prednisone...

22:48.480 --> 22:51.600
(Phone rings)
Simmons.

23:28.160 --> 23:30.759
Yes. Alright, Mrs Thornton.

23:30.760 --> 23:33.439
We will keep that in mind.
Thank you very much.

23:33.440 --> 23:35.199
What the hell's going on here?

23:35.200 --> 23:38.079
This morning's edition
has ignited a lot of interest.

23:38.080 --> 23:40.399
Mainly people saying
how terrible it is.

23:40.400 --> 23:44.599
Someone claimed it was the Soviets.
No real leads, as yet.

23:44.600 --> 23:49.559
It says here, 'The Courier
is offering a reward of £100

23:49.560 --> 23:51.319
to the first reader with information

23:51.320 --> 23:53.319
leading to
the rescue of Mrs Chapman.'

23:53.320 --> 23:54.799
Not really what we had in mind.

23:54.800 --> 23:56.679
We'll be organising
a vigilante group next.

23:56.680 --> 23:59.359
What's going on with
the search parties?

23:59.360 --> 24:01.439
We're finished at the depot
and at the house.

24:01.440 --> 24:05.319
We'll start a sweep of Perry Park,
all those caravans next, and then...

24:05.320 --> 24:08.439
Check the pubs, boarding houses,
any vacant blocks. And chemists.

24:08.440 --> 24:10.439
I want to know if anyone's
asking for prednisone.

24:10.440 --> 24:13.919
And also this, um, chap the doctor
was pursuing at Irene's house.

24:13.920 --> 24:16.719
I saw him outside the Chapman house
yesterday morning.

24:16.720 --> 24:18.479
He fits the description

24:18.480 --> 24:21.359
of someone Mrs Gilmore described
arguing with Judith -

24:21.360 --> 24:25.639
six foot tall, unshaven,
brownish hair.

24:25.640 --> 24:27.399
What happened with Mrs Gilmore?

24:27.400 --> 24:30.399
Yes, she has the phone number
but she's never used it,

24:30.400 --> 24:31.879
never gave it to anyone.

24:31.880 --> 24:35.439
Right.
Alright, everyone, listen up.

24:35.440 --> 24:39.439
Time is running out for Mrs Chapman,
so let's keep pushing.

24:39.440 --> 24:42.239
We can't just sit back and wait for
this kidnaper to call back.

24:42.240 --> 24:44.279
Understood?
(All agree)

24:44.280 --> 24:45.759
Alright.

24:45.760 --> 24:47.359
Laurie Chapman - what about him?

24:47.360 --> 24:50.439
Well, apparently he was
pacing his cell all last night.

24:50.440 --> 24:52.720
Is he still free to go?

24:54.280 --> 24:55.760
Let me check something first.

24:58.440 --> 25:01.079
So, according to
the Lottery Commissioner,

25:01.080 --> 25:03.639
under the rules,
a prize is paid after 30 days.

25:03.640 --> 25:07.039
The paper said they'd received
the money and there's a photograph.

25:07.040 --> 25:10.039
Just to promote the next draw.
Mr Chapman was happy to play along.

25:10.040 --> 25:13.920
So he was telling the truth?
Yes, well, about that, anyway.

25:15.120 --> 25:17.679
Mr Chapman, as part of
the release process,

25:17.680 --> 25:20.679
I have to make sure you haven't
sustained any injuries,

25:20.680 --> 25:22.799
no cuts or abrasions.

25:22.800 --> 25:24.999
No. Have you seen Elizabeth?

25:25.000 --> 25:27.599
Yes. She's coping as well
as can be expected.

25:27.600 --> 25:29.319
You're going to pick her up?

25:29.320 --> 25:31.599
The best thing I can do now
is go find her mother.

25:31.600 --> 25:33.239
Of course. Mr Chapman?

25:33.240 --> 25:36.039
I'm going to have to have a look
at your medical records -

25:36.040 --> 25:38.200
just check your blood type.

25:39.880 --> 25:44.440
I have nothing else to hide.
Call Dr Spencer. I'll let him know.

25:48.600 --> 25:50.159
Lucien, is that you?

25:50.160 --> 25:52.120
Sorry, Jean.
I'm just passing through.

26:00.800 --> 26:03.120
You didn't come home last night.

26:04.440 --> 26:05.999
No. Um...

26:06.000 --> 26:09.719
I'm sorry, Jean, honestly.
I should've called you.

26:09.720 --> 26:12.599
It's this kidnapping business.
Yes, I know. I've seen the paper.

26:12.600 --> 26:14.639
The poor little girl?
Yes.

26:14.640 --> 26:16.759
'The victim's 10-year-old daughter

26:16.760 --> 26:19.279
was rescued from the scene by
an observant neighbour.'

26:19.280 --> 26:22.759
Marjorie Gilmore.
'Observant'? Certainly.

26:22.760 --> 26:24.359
Not exactly caring.

26:24.360 --> 26:26.119
She was Margie Jones
when I knew her.

26:26.120 --> 26:29.399
She married the owner of the factory
where she used to work.

26:29.400 --> 26:32.279
I'd heard that she'd taken on
some airs and graces.

26:32.280 --> 26:34.559
What were you looking for?
Prednisone.

26:34.560 --> 26:36.279
I thought you might need this.

26:36.280 --> 26:38.239
Oh! I don't know
what I'd do without you.

26:38.240 --> 26:41.520
Neither do I but you'd be doing it
wearing yesterday's shirt.

26:43.040 --> 26:44.839
The kidnapper threatened
to chop her up.

26:44.840 --> 26:47.039
Where does the Courier
get that kind of detail?

26:47.040 --> 26:51.840
Chief Superintendent Carlyle
thinks the press need incentives.

26:53.240 --> 26:58.079
He actually said, 'Tie her down
so she can get chopped up.'

26:58.080 --> 27:03.640
'Tie her down'...
Now, why would he say it like that?

27:07.760 --> 27:09.360
The phone box.

27:11.280 --> 27:12.760
We've got a phone.

27:30.240 --> 27:32.999
(Man whispers) If you don't
do what I say, I'll tie her down

27:33.000 --> 27:34.800
so she gets chopped up.

29:06.560 --> 29:08.999
(Muffled cries)

29:09.000 --> 29:11.760
(Cries)

29:19.760 --> 29:21.920
(Groans)

29:24.440 --> 29:26.680
(Grunts)

29:42.080 --> 29:45.839
Are you sure you're OK?
Oh, I'm fine. No concussion.

29:45.840 --> 29:49.319
Hobart says the old bloke's name
was Bluey. Homeless.

29:49.320 --> 29:51.239
Always hanging around here
watching the trains.

29:51.240 --> 29:54.119
This time he saw something
he shouldn't have.

29:54.120 --> 29:56.359
You sure I can't get
Dr Harvey for you?

29:56.360 --> 29:58.040
Frank, I'm fine. Thank you, though.

30:11.360 --> 30:14.079
Looks like he may have heard
some of what you said.

30:14.080 --> 30:15.599
Would that have helped?

30:15.600 --> 30:18.839
Painkillers. Useless, I'm afraid.

30:18.840 --> 30:23.359
Boss? They found nothing in
the yards - no witnesses, no tracks.

30:23.360 --> 30:27.079
We'll have to expand the search.
They can't have just disappeared.

30:27.080 --> 30:29.839
Is it true that
you missed Mrs Chapman?

30:29.840 --> 30:32.080
It's not the time, Miss Anderson.
Not the time.

30:51.080 --> 30:52.559
(Grunts)
Lucien?

30:52.560 --> 30:54.159
Everything alright?

30:54.160 --> 30:57.880
Jean. Been a very interesting
morning.

31:05.160 --> 31:07.319
Poor chap.

31:07.320 --> 31:09.439
He was homeless, innocent.

31:09.440 --> 31:12.279
Uninvolved.

31:12.280 --> 31:15.999
If I'd just...
Oh, I nearly had her, Jean.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.120
I-I-I very nearly had her.

31:19.400 --> 31:21.240
You're doing the best that you can.

31:33.080 --> 31:35.000
(Grunts)

31:54.600 --> 31:57.639
Cause of death - asphyxiation.
Airway's been compressed.

31:57.640 --> 32:01.079
There's damage to the larynxand the
hyoid bone might've been fractured.

32:01.080 --> 32:03.480
Strangulation?
Yes.

32:05.080 --> 32:07.719
The marks are quite diffuse.
No lines or cuts.

32:07.720 --> 32:09.320
He was probably...

32:10.320 --> 32:11.799
...strangled by hand.

32:11.800 --> 32:14.679
We'll know for certain in the
morning, once the bruising's up.

32:14.680 --> 32:16.679
Yes.

32:16.680 --> 32:20.200
What did you see, Bluey? Hmm?

32:21.840 --> 32:24.559
A woman tied up you tried to help.

32:24.560 --> 32:26.840
He came and he had to kill you.

32:28.600 --> 32:33.360
But the hunger for air
would've caused you to struggle.

32:34.920 --> 32:38.759
Anything under the fingernails?
Plenty of dirtbut no blood.

32:38.760 --> 32:43.399
I'm still examining his clothes.
They're very worn and dirty.

32:43.400 --> 32:45.000
There's no...

32:47.840 --> 32:50.999
The last thing those gloves
would've grasped

32:51.000 --> 32:52.799
would've been the killer himself.

32:52.800 --> 32:54.400
What are they?

32:57.280 --> 33:01.039
Oh, little diamonds and little clubs,

33:01.040 --> 33:04.479
like... like what you'd see
in a deck of playing cards.

33:04.480 --> 33:06.519
Lucky symbols.

33:06.520 --> 33:09.319
Not for Bluey.

33:09.320 --> 33:12.439
BILL: Davis says he's walked the
gardens, Victoria Park, the lookout.

33:12.440 --> 33:14.359
Still nothing.
Alright.

33:14.360 --> 33:17.440
Tell him to move to the highway.
Check every shed, every humpy.

33:18.840 --> 33:22.919
Mrs Beasley! Um, the doctor
is still on his way.

33:22.920 --> 33:25.720
I know.
I thought you might all be hungry.

33:28.480 --> 33:31.679
Very thoughtful of you.
Has anyone called?

33:31.680 --> 33:34.919
No, not the, um,
call we were hoping for.

33:34.920 --> 33:38.440
Oh. Poor woman.
Kept me awake, thinking about it.

33:39.560 --> 33:41.759
Did Mr Chapman
buy the lottery ticket himself?

33:41.760 --> 33:44.599
Um, as far as I know, yes.

33:44.600 --> 33:46.479
It's just that,
when I bought my ticket,

33:46.480 --> 33:49.039
I noticed most of the customers
were women.

33:49.040 --> 33:51.039
The ladies were all
talking about it.

33:51.040 --> 33:52.679
But it's probably nothing.

33:52.680 --> 33:54.479
It's actually a very good question.

33:54.480 --> 33:57.439
Bill, get on to the Lottery
Commissioner and ask him.

33:57.440 --> 34:00.559
Ah! Lucien, what do you have for me?

34:00.560 --> 34:04.479
Not much, I'm afraid.
We do have something.

34:04.480 --> 34:07.639
We found these in Bluey's gloves.

34:07.640 --> 34:10.879
He would've been
clinging to his killer,

34:10.880 --> 34:12.478
clawing at his clothes and look.

34:12.480 --> 34:15.518
Some of these are diamond-shaped,
some club-shaped.

34:15.520 --> 34:17.438
I have absolutely no idea
what they are.

34:17.440 --> 34:19.040
What's he saying, Bill?

34:19.080 --> 34:21.478
Mrs Chapman bought the winning
ticket. It's in her name.

34:21.480 --> 34:24.518
Hang on. That's not
what the press said.

34:24.520 --> 34:27.199
Not what Laurie said either.
Right.

34:27.199 --> 34:30.719
Well, these little buggers
are driving me mad.

34:32.080 --> 34:33.840
I think I know what they are.

34:37.239 --> 34:41.719
Those are chads.
From bus tickets. Why?

34:41.719 --> 34:45.599
They were found at the building
where Judith was being held.

34:45.600 --> 34:47.438
Dulcie's very sweet on you.

34:47.440 --> 34:52.119
I mean, you're her manager,
ex-footy champ, everyone's hero.

34:52.120 --> 34:54.518
I'll go so far as to say
she idolises you.

34:54.520 --> 34:57.439
Dulcie didn't do this.
These are all over the buses.

34:57.440 --> 35:00.919
Dulcie says that you slept with her,
that you're having an affair.

35:00.920 --> 35:02.439
You're in love!
That's not true.

35:02.440 --> 35:04.640
Who bought the bloody
lottery ticket, Laurie?

35:08.320 --> 35:10.639
Alright, it was Judith.
Judith bought the ticket.

35:10.640 --> 35:12.279
She doesn't like the spotlight.

35:12.280 --> 35:14.680
So the cheque's in her name?
You two have a joint account?

35:16.240 --> 35:18.279
Yes. Why?

35:18.280 --> 35:21.399
With her out of the way, you bank
the cheque, run off with Dulcie.

35:21.400 --> 35:23.719
But I told you,
Jude doesn't have the money yet.

35:23.720 --> 35:26.359
No, but she found out about Dulcie,
so you had to act now.

35:26.360 --> 35:31.559
There's nothing to find out.
I'm not sleeping with Dulcie.

35:31.560 --> 35:33.200
Why would she say you were?

35:38.160 --> 35:42.040
Because I changed my mind.
We argued.

35:43.400 --> 35:45.600
It was a long drive back to
Ballarat, believe me.

35:47.200 --> 35:50.759
Right. So just the two of you?
No-one else saw you?

35:50.760 --> 35:53.240
Yeah.

35:55.160 --> 35:57.639
His alibi rests with Miss Young.

35:57.640 --> 35:59.799
Neither of them can agree
on what happened.

35:59.800 --> 36:03.639
Yes, and if his blood matches
what we found at the crime scene,

36:03.640 --> 36:05.719
well, we may well have our man.

36:05.720 --> 36:08.719
You're an idiot, Rod!
Shut up, woman!

36:08.720 --> 36:10.439
Hey, hey! Enough! Enough!

36:10.440 --> 36:13.839
We were at the chemist.
We saw him running out of the bank.

36:13.840 --> 36:15.679
Tried to pass a cheque
as Laurie Chapman.

36:15.680 --> 36:19.439
Name's Rod Brunel.
He met her outside.

36:19.440 --> 36:22.599
Mr Brunel, let me take a look
at that nose of yours.

36:22.600 --> 36:25.559
Does it bleed often?
No, it doesn't.

36:25.560 --> 36:28.479
And it wouldn't have bled now
except he... Hey!

36:28.480 --> 36:31.200
Alright. Just...
Just give me a minute.

36:33.720 --> 36:36.079
There we are.
(Groans)

36:36.080 --> 36:38.159
Nothing's broken.
Alright.

36:38.160 --> 36:40.280
You and I, let's have a little chat,
Mr Brunel.

36:46.840 --> 36:49.679
Bill, could you get Dr Harvey
to test his blood type?

36:49.680 --> 36:52.439
Also, Mr Chapman's medical records
may have come in.

36:52.440 --> 36:57.279
Now, if either of them
are not type O,

36:57.280 --> 36:59.359
might be able to eliminate someone.

36:59.360 --> 37:01.280
OK, Doc.
Thank you.

37:02.560 --> 37:05.000
(Knocks on door)

37:06.440 --> 37:08.000
Miss Henderson?

37:11.680 --> 37:13.360
Irene?

37:16.560 --> 37:18.280
Is anybody here?

37:23.480 --> 37:25.080
Hello.

37:31.160 --> 37:32.680
So, you're Elizabeth?

37:34.640 --> 37:36.200
Rose.

37:38.600 --> 37:40.239
Where's Grandma?

37:40.240 --> 37:43.039
She went out.
To lunch?

37:43.040 --> 37:45.999
Early this morning,
before breakfast.

37:46.000 --> 37:48.160
She went looking for her friend.

37:55.240 --> 37:58.279
Have you got a bag? Good.

37:58.280 --> 38:02.239
Better go grab it. I'm going to
take you somewhere safe.

38:02.240 --> 38:03.800
Is that alright with you?

38:08.800 --> 38:13.639
I didn't know the cheque was forged.
Irene said Jude gave it to her.

38:13.640 --> 38:16.759
Well, I don't blame you for trying.
Really, I don't.

38:16.760 --> 38:19.359
I mean, your girlfriend
drags you all the way to Ballarat

38:19.360 --> 38:21.359
on the promise of a big pay day

38:21.360 --> 38:23.239
and Jude turns around and says,
'Pfft! No'.

38:23.240 --> 38:24.879
I mean, that would make
my blood boil.

38:24.880 --> 38:26.280
I didn't touch Jude.

38:27.360 --> 38:29.880
And yet you ran off
yesterday afternoon.

38:31.840 --> 38:33.439
So, this morning, you go out.

38:33.440 --> 38:36.599
Now, you either were off
forging a cheque

38:36.600 --> 38:39.439
or you were strangling a man
to death

38:39.440 --> 38:41.119
and moving Judith to a new location.

38:41.120 --> 38:42.639
Which one was it?
What?

38:42.640 --> 38:45.079
I swear, I-I don't even know
where Jude is.

38:45.080 --> 38:46.559
Irene says, 'Here's the cheque.

38:46.560 --> 38:49.599
Jude's given it to me.
Let's go and cash it.'

38:49.600 --> 38:52.759
Yeah.
And you believed her?

38:52.760 --> 38:55.439
Why? Ah! Because they're
mother and daughter.

38:55.440 --> 38:57.719
Exactly. They're family.

38:57.720 --> 39:01.039
Even though you argued with Judith
over money

39:01.040 --> 39:02.679
on her doorstep only last week!

39:02.680 --> 39:05.599
I suppose the old biddy next door
told you.

39:05.600 --> 39:09.000
I bet she didn't mention that
she got me to hock her silverware.

39:10.560 --> 39:14.040
Too proud for the local pawnshop.
Wanted me to fence it in Melbourne.

39:16.440 --> 39:19.760
You certainly have
a way with the ladies, Rod.

39:20.840 --> 39:22.760
You were with Irene a while back.

39:24.000 --> 39:26.679
Suddenly, you reappear
after her daughter wins the lottery.

39:26.680 --> 39:28.239
Fancy that, Frank.

39:28.240 --> 39:31.799
But when it stopped looking like
it might pay dividends,

39:31.800 --> 39:34.079
you went to Judith directly.

39:34.080 --> 39:36.720
And when that didn't work,
you kidnapped her.

39:38.000 --> 39:40.519
It was tearing Irene up,
arguing with Jude.

39:40.520 --> 39:44.239
I went around to explain -
and yeah, OK, to ask her for money.

39:44.240 --> 39:47.440
Jude, she didn't even want to know,
and then she disappeared.

39:49.760 --> 39:51.440
It wasn't me!

39:55.040 --> 39:57.079
Rod bungled passing a cheque.

39:57.080 --> 40:00.559
(Scoffs) You really think
he could pull of a kidnapping?

40:00.560 --> 40:03.720
And all this happened
whilst Judith is still missing.

40:06.760 --> 40:08.799
You think I'm not worried sick
about my daughter?

40:08.800 --> 40:10.600
Well, you have a funny way
of showing it.

40:12.280 --> 40:15.400
Irene, did you know Rod had been
to see Judith about the money?

40:17.360 --> 40:18.999
Afterwards.

40:19.000 --> 40:20.799
Yeah.

40:20.800 --> 40:24.439
Shouldn't have done it.
But he shouldn't have had to.

40:24.440 --> 40:28.760
Not that it's Jude's fault either.
She wanted to help you?

40:30.840 --> 40:35.359
Then she changed her mind.
She said it was all tied up.

40:35.360 --> 40:37.880
That was Laurie talking.

40:40.160 --> 40:43.759
I'll charge Rod for the cheque.
I've got nothing much on Irene.

40:43.760 --> 40:48.199
Mrs Gilmore does have money troubles
but really, she's hardly likely.

40:48.200 --> 40:50.599
As for Laurie...
Ah, sir?

40:50.600 --> 40:55.119
Dr Harvey tested the blood.
Rod Brunel is type O.

40:55.120 --> 40:58.319
Ah! Same as the blood we found
in the kitchen.

40:58.320 --> 41:02.319
Yes. However, she's received Laurie
Chapman's medical records as well.

41:02.320 --> 41:04.239
He's type O also.

41:04.240 --> 41:09.079
Ah, um, excuse us?
Look who I found all on her own.

41:09.080 --> 41:11.119
We stopped for an ice-cream.

41:11.120 --> 41:13.439
The police will
take care of you now.

41:13.440 --> 41:16.199
The Doctor is very nice,
the Chief Super is nice

41:16.200 --> 41:19.679
and Sergeant Davis, well,
he's a bit of an odd duck

41:19.680 --> 41:21.440
but he's alright too.

41:23.400 --> 41:26.239
Jean? Jean!

41:26.240 --> 41:29.519
Lucien!
I've saved some lunch for you.

41:29.520 --> 41:31.840
How lovely. Is there enough for two?

41:34.600 --> 41:36.440
Well, of course there is.

41:40.320 --> 41:42.319
Not very hungry?

41:42.320 --> 41:45.239
No, but that was lovely.

41:45.240 --> 41:47.359
Thank you, Mrs Blake.

41:47.360 --> 41:49.919
You're very welcome.
You've got lovely manners.

41:49.920 --> 41:53.599
And I'm Mrs Beasley.
The Doctor and I aren't married.

41:53.600 --> 41:55.479
Why not?

41:55.480 --> 41:57.120
Well...

41:58.920 --> 42:01.119
...we used to be married
to other people

42:01.120 --> 42:04.560
and now we live together so that
I can help him with his work.

42:05.560 --> 42:07.160
Do you love him?

42:09.240 --> 42:10.720
(Knock at door)

42:12.240 --> 42:13.920
I'll get it!

42:15.040 --> 42:17.279
I think perhaps we should
clean up these dishes

42:17.280 --> 42:18.839
and go into the garden.

42:18.840 --> 42:21.080
What do you think?
OK.

42:28.480 --> 42:30.680
Lucien.
Frank.

42:32.160 --> 42:35.279
How's young Elizabeth?
Fine. She's just having lunch.

42:35.280 --> 42:36.839
Very good.

42:36.840 --> 42:39.079
Um...

42:39.080 --> 42:40.720
The press...

42:43.600 --> 42:46.999
Fact of life these days,
but also a double-edged sword.

42:47.000 --> 42:48.760
Look...

42:50.000 --> 42:51.719
...Melbourne is getting very
restless.

42:51.720 --> 42:54.399
They want me to charge
someone today.

42:54.400 --> 42:55.879
Melbourne!

42:55.880 --> 42:58.519
This is all about
sweeping everything aside

42:58.520 --> 43:00.119
before that second lottery draw.

43:00.120 --> 43:01.719
Everything points to
Laurie Chapman -

43:01.720 --> 43:04.079
the chads, the phone box,
the derelict building -

43:04.080 --> 43:05.559
they all say 'bus depot'.

43:05.560 --> 43:08.079
A lot of people work there.
He's the right blood type.

43:08.080 --> 43:10.439
A very common blood type.
He knew the phone number.

43:10.440 --> 43:13.879
Yes, but we can't definitively prove
who knew it and who didn't.

43:13.880 --> 43:15.559
Lucien, his alibi is full of holes -

43:15.560 --> 43:18.439
unaccounted for
when those calls came in

43:18.440 --> 43:20.719
and then there were no calls
when he was locked up.

43:20.720 --> 43:22.719
No calls after he was released.

43:22.720 --> 43:25.599
He lied to police
and he has the most to gain.

43:25.600 --> 43:29.279
This kidnapping turns to a murder,
he inherits all the money himself

43:29.280 --> 43:30.759
and for his mistress.

43:30.760 --> 43:33.319
I'm gonna have to charge him.

43:33.320 --> 43:39.079
Frank, if we charge the wrong person
and Judith, in fact, does die,

43:39.080 --> 43:40.679
it will be a disaster!

43:40.680 --> 43:42.800
You think I don't know that?

43:46.880 --> 43:48.920
Superintendent.
Mrs Beasley.

43:51.920 --> 43:53.639
Ooh!

43:53.640 --> 43:56.719
There's a random magic wand!
Ah!

43:56.720 --> 43:58.679
It can make the grass turn into...

43:58.680 --> 44:00.639
What about that little treasure?

44:00.640 --> 44:04.680
She'll become a ward of the state,
or perhaps go to Irene.

44:07.280 --> 44:10.399
Lucien, do we have any new evidence,
any information whatsoever

44:10.400 --> 44:12.320
that can point us to our man?

44:22.080 --> 44:24.039
Not yet.

44:24.040 --> 44:26.439
Where's Elizabeth?!
Well, I don't have her.

44:26.440 --> 44:28.919
I know you've got her!
Oh! Oh!

44:28.920 --> 44:32.399
I told you! Why would I be
looking after your granddaughter?!

44:32.400 --> 44:34.399
Oh! Bloody snob!

44:34.400 --> 44:37.319
You know, I knew you
when you were as common as muck!

44:37.320 --> 44:40.599
Oh! Your own daughter doesn't want
anything to do with you!

44:40.600 --> 44:42.239
Ladies, please!

44:42.240 --> 44:45.239
Oh, Doctor!
She was trying to get into my home.

44:45.240 --> 44:47.839
She has got my Elizabeth!
She doesn't, Irene.

44:47.840 --> 44:49.999
I promise you,
Elizabeth's perfectly fine.

44:50.000 --> 44:51.439
But Judith is still missing

44:51.440 --> 44:53.879
and here you are fighting like
naughty children!

44:53.880 --> 44:55.359
Now, Irene, please!

44:55.360 --> 44:57.240
(Huffs)

44:58.440 --> 44:59.879
Thank you so much, Doctor.

44:59.880 --> 45:02.759
Please, feel free to use my phone
to call the police.

45:02.760 --> 45:04.679
Oh, I'm sure that won't be necessary.

45:04.680 --> 45:06.919
Mrs Henderson's just worried
about her family.

45:06.920 --> 45:09.839
Oh, well, if you don't call
the police, I will.

45:09.840 --> 45:12.079
It's people who get above
their station

45:12.080 --> 45:13.839
that cause the trouble in the world!

45:13.840 --> 45:15.439
I see.

45:15.440 --> 45:19.080
And of course you speak with some
authority, given your background.

45:20.280 --> 45:24.200
I thought you, of all people,
might understand.

45:26.240 --> 45:30.840
I don't need people in the area
to remind me of where I came from.

45:34.440 --> 45:36.039
Mrs Gi...

45:36.040 --> 45:37.840
Marjorie...

45:38.880 --> 45:43.119
I know things are...
difficult for you at the moment.

45:43.120 --> 45:47.839
But quite honestly,
it's the Rod Brunels of this world

45:47.840 --> 45:50.319
who aren't to be trusted,
not people like the Chapmans.

45:50.320 --> 45:52.519
And do you know what?
If they make it through this,

45:52.520 --> 45:54.320
they're going to need
a good neighbour.

45:55.440 --> 45:57.120
And perhaps you will too.

46:04.920 --> 46:06.719
Am I under arrest?

46:06.720 --> 46:08.439
No.

46:08.440 --> 46:10.839
Well, are you gonna arrest her?

46:10.840 --> 46:13.679
You know she doesn't have
anything to do with it.

46:13.680 --> 46:15.279
Yeah, I know.

46:15.280 --> 46:18.840
I just... I had to take it out
on someone.

46:20.560 --> 46:22.319
And I can understand that.

46:22.320 --> 46:24.480
She's right, you know.

46:25.600 --> 46:27.399
Jude doesn't want much
to do with me.

46:27.400 --> 46:30.199
Oh, I'm sure that isn't true.

46:30.200 --> 46:35.239
I spent years taking her to doctors
and somehow she pulled through

46:35.240 --> 46:40.119
and... and now, she's...
she's made a new life for herself,

46:40.120 --> 46:41.840
better than I ever did.

46:43.360 --> 46:45.159
I'm proud of her.

46:45.160 --> 46:47.479
And I know...

46:47.480 --> 46:49.800
(Sighs) I know I don't fit in.

46:51.680 --> 46:53.360
But without her, I...

46:54.720 --> 46:56.920
...I'll be left behind.

46:59.000 --> 47:02.160
And no-one wants to be left behind.

47:03.720 --> 47:05.520
Irene, I need to make a phone call.

47:18.760 --> 47:20.719
Funny thing, jealousy, isn't it?

47:20.720 --> 47:22.679
Dulcie?

47:22.680 --> 47:24.799
You can't really envy someone

47:24.800 --> 47:28.239
without being close to them somehow,
can you?

47:28.240 --> 47:32.239
I mean, we know
you were envious of Judith

47:32.240 --> 47:35.999
and we know you were with Laurie
when the kidnapper first called.

47:36.000 --> 47:37.439
What are you saying?

47:37.440 --> 47:39.879
You told anyone who'd listen
about the two of you

47:39.880 --> 47:44.479
but you never actually
slept with him, did you?

47:44.480 --> 47:47.199
No.
No.

47:47.200 --> 47:52.719
You lied because he rejected you.
I didn't kidnap Judith...

47:52.720 --> 47:55.399
Now, rejection,
that's an interesting thing.

47:55.400 --> 47:57.479
I think Laurie...

47:57.480 --> 48:00.479
I think Laurie
left someone behind too,

48:00.480 --> 48:03.000
long before you arrived on the scene.

48:05.680 --> 48:08.519
Cliff has known Laurie since school.

48:08.520 --> 48:10.719
What's he on about?

48:10.720 --> 48:13.439
How's your nose?
I thought you had a cold.

48:13.440 --> 48:18.159
When we first saw you, you had to
check that it wasn't bleeding,

48:18.160 --> 48:23.119
like it did when you snatched Judith
and she slammed her head into it.

48:23.120 --> 48:25.439
I got no reason to hurt Mrs Chapman.

48:25.440 --> 48:27.359
No. No.

48:27.360 --> 48:29.519
But what about Laurie?

48:29.520 --> 48:31.239
Hmm?

48:31.240 --> 48:35.919
You played football with him
before he hit the big-time.

48:35.920 --> 48:38.079
You worked with him, side by side,

48:38.080 --> 48:42.519
but he was the one who got promoted.

48:42.520 --> 48:45.279
I mean, for heaven's sake,
you've known him all your life

48:45.280 --> 48:46.880
and yet...

48:48.120 --> 48:50.040
...he never introduced you to Judith.

48:52.320 --> 48:53.800
And the lottery? Well...

48:54.840 --> 48:56.879
...that was the last straw.

48:56.880 --> 48:58.519
Cliff?
(Scoffs)

48:58.520 --> 49:00.799
I dunno what he's talking about.

49:00.800 --> 49:02.920
You thought he was your mate.

49:04.720 --> 49:06.440
He just...

49:07.840 --> 49:09.520
...left you behind.

49:12.120 --> 49:14.600
Judith. Where is she?

49:16.400 --> 49:17.760
S...

49:23.440 --> 49:26.559
Fell out of the sky for bloody
Laurie. That's...

49:26.560 --> 49:29.839
Why did he have it all?
We make our own luck in life.

49:29.840 --> 49:32.040
You listen to me. Where is she?

49:36.440 --> 49:37.839
Oh!

49:37.840 --> 49:40.679
Come on! Come on!
(Grunts)

49:40.680 --> 49:42.320
(Sobs)

49:44.000 --> 49:45.839
(Handcuffs lock)

49:45.840 --> 49:49.479
Cliff, we already have you
for the murder of Bluey Watson.

49:49.480 --> 49:51.119
Self defence! He attacked me!

49:51.120 --> 49:54.919
And now you've as good as admitted
the kidnapping, you stupid bugger.

49:54.920 --> 49:56.439
I'm not stupid!

49:56.440 --> 49:58.120
No. No, you're not.

49:59.760 --> 50:01.399
You're not stupid.

50:01.400 --> 50:04.359
You made a clean getaway,
left no clues.

50:04.360 --> 50:06.759
It was a very, very clever plan.

50:06.760 --> 50:09.799
All you had to do was tell us
where to leave the money

50:09.800 --> 50:14.119
and we'd have exchanged it
for Judith gladly -

50:14.120 --> 50:18.320
as long as she was alive.

50:20.200 --> 50:22.159
Is that why you won't tell us
where she is?

50:22.160 --> 50:24.040
No. No!

50:25.160 --> 50:27.839
'Cause you bloody killed her.
Isn't that right?

50:27.840 --> 50:29.879
I didn't murder anyone!

50:29.880 --> 50:34.439
She got sick. I tried to help her!
I did! Look, she got pains.

50:34.440 --> 50:36.199
I gave her a powder.

50:36.200 --> 50:40.079
Then she started vomiting
and shaking and...

50:40.080 --> 50:42.759
Then she just faded away.

50:42.760 --> 50:45.079
I never meant for that,
I never meant for that!

50:45.080 --> 50:49.439
Hang on, what you're describing is a
thing we call an 'Addisonian crisis',

50:49.440 --> 50:51.999
where a patient slips into
a type of coma.

50:52.000 --> 50:53.799
She might still be alive.

50:53.800 --> 50:55.679
I didn't kill her?

50:55.680 --> 50:59.279
She was in pain, convulsing
and then nothing, yes?

50:59.280 --> 51:01.320
She wasn't moving.

51:02.520 --> 51:04.640
Cliff, are you even certain
she's dead?

51:07.120 --> 51:10.560
You might still be able to save her.
Now, don't you want that?

51:11.880 --> 51:13.560
Don't let her die now.

51:16.240 --> 51:19.080
(Sirens wail)

51:34.040 --> 51:35.520
Doc! Here!

51:40.840 --> 51:44.080
Frank, we've got a pulse.
Call for an ambulance now!

52:27.480 --> 52:29.360
You were right, Lucien.

52:33.640 --> 52:36.639
The truth is,
I had an unfair advantage.

52:36.640 --> 52:38.559
Yes? And what was that?

52:38.560 --> 52:41.000
I know what it's like
to lose a family.

52:44.280 --> 52:48.359
Thank you, Doctor.
You are very welcome, Elizabeth.

52:48.360 --> 52:51.759
Would you say thank you
to Mrs Blake too?

52:51.760 --> 52:55.440
Ah, well, the thing with Jean...

52:57.000 --> 52:59.080
Of course I will.

53:12.480 --> 53:14.400
A few details and a comment.

53:20.520 --> 53:22.360
(Mutters quietly)

53:26.040 --> 53:27.839
What, this is it?
Yes.

53:27.840 --> 53:30.439
The perpetrator, all the details,
an exclusive statement.

53:30.440 --> 53:34.279
But where's the photo?
The happy family reunited?

53:34.280 --> 53:38.679
Carlyle didn't let me in the room
but this...

53:38.680 --> 53:42.799
I'm selling the sizzle,
not just the steak here, Rose.

53:42.800 --> 53:46.200
If you're not up to the job...
I am. Trust me. I am.

53:48.040 --> 53:49.600
Type these up, please.

53:51.000 --> 53:52.480
You, come with me.

54:01.640 --> 54:04.240
It was lovely to see
that little girl smiling again.

54:06.720 --> 54:08.359
And Judith Chapman?

54:08.360 --> 54:10.440
Doing well, thankfully.

54:12.040 --> 54:14.399
I'd say she can expect to make
a full recovery.

54:14.400 --> 54:17.159
Oh, thank goodness
you got to her in time.

54:17.160 --> 54:18.639
Well, we were lucky.

54:18.640 --> 54:21.760
And that little girl still has
her family tonight because of you.

54:31.120 --> 54:32.640
Jean, would you mind, um...

54:33.840 --> 54:37.919
Would you mind, um, just waiting
here, just... just for a moment?

54:37.920 --> 54:39.440
Alright.

54:41.320 --> 54:42.880
Right.

54:51.680 --> 54:53.600
(Footsteps approach)

55:02.280 --> 55:04.280
Jean, would you mind standing
for me, please?

55:10.720 --> 55:13.320
Actually, do you know what?
Let's... Let's have a seat.

55:24.120 --> 55:27.160
Jean, this was my mother's ring.
(Gasps)Lucien!

55:31.240 --> 55:34.800
And I would very much...
(Knock at door)

55:36.200 --> 55:38.599
Oh! That's probably Charlie.

55:38.600 --> 55:41.279
Hold that. I'll be right back.

55:41.280 --> 55:43.320
(Clears throat)

55:50.840 --> 55:52.640
Perfect timing, Charlie.

56:01.560 --> 56:04.440
Lucien? Who is it?

56:11.240 --> 56:12.720
My wife.

56:14.720 --> 56:17.240
WOMAN: It's horse racing.
Everyone's questionable.

56:18.240 --> 56:19.920
Lucien?
Not now, Jean.

56:21.520 --> 56:23.839
Tell her it's a safe track
for a dangerous sport, Doctor.

56:23.840 --> 56:27.879
Did you know something was going on?
Is that why you dragged me down here?

56:27.880 --> 56:31.280
What do we do?
It's obvious, isn't it?
