00:01.000 --> 00:04.600
The following programme contains
strong language.

00:12.360 --> 00:14.880
'My daughter hasn't
come home. Name's Neve Kelly.'

00:14.920 --> 00:16.000
I'm right here!

00:16.000 --> 00:16.720
I'm right here!

00:18.120 --> 00:21.560
'Someone drugged me
and then strangled me with a belt.'

00:21.600 --> 00:24.000
The victim
had the substance administered
without their knowledge.

00:24.000 --> 00:24.560
The victim
had the substance administered
without their knowledge.

00:24.600 --> 00:27.840
'If you have any information,
please contact the police.'

00:27.880 --> 00:30.640
What if I told you
that Neve's still here?

00:30.680 --> 00:32.000
Get away from me! Back off!

00:32.000 --> 00:33.360
Get away from me! Back off!

00:37.840 --> 00:40.000
Hello. You kind of look like
you want something.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.120
Hello. You kind of look like
you want something.

00:42.800 --> 00:45.400
There's nothing here for me.
Are you dumping me?

00:46.320 --> 00:48.000
So we're sticking to our story?
Yeah.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.120
So we're sticking to our story?
Yeah.

01:09.520 --> 01:11.920
Whoo!

01:11.960 --> 01:12.000
Come on, Alex!
The louder the music,
the faster you go.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.640
Come on, Alex!
The louder the music,
the faster you go.

01:14.680 --> 01:17.200
Come on!

01:17.240 --> 01:20.000
Go!

01:20.000 --> 01:20.160
Go!

01:56.280 --> 01:59.040
there's no better days

02:02.880 --> 02:05.600
until I'm scared of day

02:37.960 --> 02:39.840
You know who I am.

02:45.080 --> 02:47.600
I was expecting you
to freak out or something.

02:52.960 --> 02:54.960
Yeah. Done that a bit.

02:56.480 --> 02:58.880
Then I just thought
I was going crazy.

03:00.200 --> 03:02.200
My dad can see me too.

03:03.160 --> 03:04.000
So...

03:04.000 --> 03:04.800
So...

03:04.840 --> 03:06.560
we're both crazy.

03:07.320 --> 03:08.800
I can't explain it.

03:09.560 --> 03:11.240
But it's only you and him.

03:11.280 --> 03:12.000
Talking...to a dead girl.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.440
Talking...to a dead girl.

03:22.360 --> 03:24.520
You don't have to be afraid of me.

03:25.360 --> 03:27.680
What are you?

03:29.640 --> 03:31.640
All I can tell you is...

03:33.320 --> 03:35.360
..I'm here. I'm...

03:35.400 --> 03:36.000
real.

03:36.000 --> 03:36.800
real.

03:38.240 --> 03:40.240
They say you were murdered.

03:40.280 --> 03:42.480
There's so much I don't remember.

03:47.480 --> 03:49.800
I can't figure out
what happened on my own.

03:51.600 --> 03:52.000
Why me?
I can't speak to Joe.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.080
Why me?
I can't speak to Joe.

03:54.800 --> 03:58.240
You said we left the party together.
Wait. You don't think Joe hurt you?

03:58.280 --> 04:00.000
Maybe. I don't know.

04:00.000 --> 04:00.240
Maybe. I don't know.

04:00.280 --> 04:02.240
He would never do that.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.760
We had an argument...

04:04.800 --> 04:06.560
that night.

04:07.760 --> 04:08.000
So what do you want me to do?

04:08.000 --> 04:10.120
So what do you want me to do?

04:10.160 --> 04:13.160
Question him.
Find out what he's done.

04:13.200 --> 04:16.000
Can't you get your dad to do it?
He won't tell Dad.

04:16.040 --> 04:18.040
You're his cousin.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.080
This is fucked up.

04:21.880 --> 04:23.880
Joe and I aren't exactly close.

04:24.880 --> 04:26.880
I've been away for a while.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.760
I don't think he'll talk.

04:30.960 --> 04:32.000
Can't you try?

04:32.000 --> 04:32.440
Can't you try?

04:38.600 --> 04:40.000
They want to set up an interview
in the next few days.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.920
They want to set up an interview
in the next few days.

04:44.600 --> 04:47.800
It doesn't feel right
to be talking about this now.

04:47.840 --> 04:48.000
Joe should be thinking
about Neve today.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.080
Joe should be thinking
about Neve today.

04:50.760 --> 04:52.840
Of course, I'm thinking about her.

04:52.880 --> 04:56.000
Look, I know it's shit timing,
but it's a big opportunity

04:56.000 --> 04:56.560
Look, I know it's shit timing,
but it's a big opportunity

04:56.600 --> 04:58.280
and you deserve it, son.

04:58.320 --> 04:59.840
You've worked hard.

05:01.600 --> 05:03.200
You all right?
Aye.

05:03.240 --> 05:04.000
Your shift finished hours ago.
I went for a walk.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.720
Your shift finished hours ago.
I went for a walk.

05:06.760 --> 05:09.600
Your cousin's just scored
a big sponsorship deal.

05:11.040 --> 05:12.000
That's great.

05:12.000 --> 05:12.760
That's great.

05:13.520 --> 05:14.800
Cheers.

05:15.520 --> 05:17.520
You got a minute?

05:17.560 --> 05:19.200
Why?

05:20.000 --> 05:22.200
Cos I'm asking.

05:36.080 --> 05:39.200
What's wrong with it?
Brakes feel a bit strange.

05:41.560 --> 05:43.240
Strange, how?

05:44.320 --> 05:47.120
Oh, like, they do this
sort of bunny-hopping thing.

05:47.160 --> 05:49.440
Like...not smooth.

05:54.720 --> 05:56.720
Ask him if he hurt me.

06:05.160 --> 06:07.520
You hardly said a word to me
at the party.

06:10.080 --> 06:13.120
I haven't really seen you
since I've got back.

06:14.040 --> 06:15.640
I've been busy.

06:16.880 --> 06:18.480
With training...

06:18.520 --> 06:20.360
and the race.

06:21.240 --> 06:22.720
Congrats on the win.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.480
Thanks.

06:26.480 --> 06:30.440
Must be really nice...
family being proud of you.

06:33.160 --> 06:35.200
Anyway, I just wanted to say...

06:35.880 --> 06:38.280
..I'm really sorry...

06:38.320 --> 06:40.000
about what happened
to your girlfriend.

06:40.000 --> 06:40.760
about what happened
to your girlfriend.

06:43.080 --> 06:45.440
Do you want to talk about it?

06:46.480 --> 06:48.000
Thanks. But...

06:48.000 --> 06:48.400
Thanks. But...

06:49.400 --> 06:51.200
..not really.

06:51.240 --> 06:53.160
Wyatt men and their feelings, huh?

06:56.040 --> 06:59.040
You know, there's a vigil
this afternoon - at the club.

07:00.200 --> 07:02.280
You coming?

07:02.320 --> 07:04.000
I didn't really know her.

07:04.000 --> 07:04.040
I didn't really know her.

07:06.840 --> 07:08.640
She was cool.

07:09.560 --> 07:11.560
You'd have liked her.

07:16.640 --> 07:18.640
Bring up the party.

07:19.400 --> 07:20.000
I saw you two together that night.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.040
I saw you two together that night.

07:23.480 --> 07:25.480
It looked like you were arguing.

07:29.320 --> 07:31.120
What happened?

07:34.280 --> 07:35.880
Tell her.

07:37.400 --> 07:39.440
You know you can talk to me...

07:40.400 --> 07:42.400
..about anything.

07:51.720 --> 07:52.000
The bike's fine.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.720
The bike's fine.

07:55.640 --> 07:59.120
But I guess you knew that.
Just wanted to make sure.

08:03.840 --> 08:05.880
Wouldn't want to have an accident.

08:12.160 --> 08:14.160
Joe...
Just leave it.

08:18.400 --> 08:20.400
What did you say to him?

08:21.680 --> 08:23.680
Yeah, cos it's always my fault.

08:29.920 --> 08:31.920
You all right?

08:33.680 --> 08:35.680
What do you think?

09:17.040 --> 09:18.840
Come round whenever you want.

09:20.040 --> 09:22.400
Even if you don't want to talk.

09:23.080 --> 09:25.880
It might help
to just go and sit in her room.

09:28.760 --> 09:30.320
I'd like that.

09:31.200 --> 09:32.680
I'm missing her.

09:33.400 --> 09:36.000
Have you thought about when you
might want to go back to school?

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
Have you thought about when you
might want to go back to school?

09:38.040 --> 09:39.720
It's OK.

09:40.440 --> 09:42.160
It's only me.

09:43.600 --> 09:44.000
Max.

09:44.000 --> 09:44.800
Max.

09:44.840 --> 09:46.800
Max?

09:46.840 --> 09:50.120
Finished with your breakfast?
Uh...thanks, Nan.

09:51.680 --> 09:52.000
You sure I can't get you something?
No, thanks, Mrs Connolly.

09:52.000 --> 09:55.080
You sure I can't get you something?
No, thanks, Mrs Connolly.

09:58.440 --> 10:00.000
I texted. But you didn't reply.

10:00.000 --> 10:00.880
I texted. But you didn't reply.

10:02.920 --> 10:05.040
Sorry. Didn't see it.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.840
Will you come to the vigil?

10:13.880 --> 10:15.720
Doesn't feel right
you not being there.

10:15.760 --> 10:16.000
I don't think I can face it.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.840
I don't think I can face it.

10:18.480 --> 10:20.960
I can call it off
if you don't want it to happen.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.360
No. It's important to you guys.

10:23.400 --> 10:24.000
It's just...
the last thing I need right now

10:24.000 --> 10:26.080
It's just...
the last thing I need right now

10:26.120 --> 10:28.080
is everyone asking how I am.

10:30.960 --> 10:32.000
We'll be there.
Thanks.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.120
We'll be there.
Thanks.

10:33.920 --> 10:37.160
Hey, now's not the time.

10:42.360 --> 10:45.840
I was wondering if I could
borrow you to help out at the club?

10:45.880 --> 10:47.480
I've kind of got stuff to do.

10:48.520 --> 10:50.240
What stuff?
Yeah.

10:50.280 --> 10:53.400
Don't you want to help
set up the vigil?

10:54.120 --> 10:56.000
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

10:56.000 --> 10:56.440
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

10:57.200 --> 10:59.720
I'll, um... I'll go get changed.

11:00.280 --> 11:01.920
Great.

11:37.720 --> 11:39.720
What are we doing here?

11:40.600 --> 11:42.000
Joseph?

11:46.040 --> 11:48.480
I thought we were going to the club.

11:59.960 --> 12:00.000
You spoken to anyone?

12:00.000 --> 12:01.960
You spoken to anyone?

12:05.960 --> 12:08.000
Why have you been ignoring my calls?
I swear I haven't said anything.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.080
Why have you been ignoring my calls?
I swear I haven't said anything.

12:09.120 --> 12:11.880
Cos it's me who'll get blamed.
I haven't said anything!

12:11.920 --> 12:15.800
You need to keep your mouth shut.
Don't talk to me like that.

12:16.600 --> 12:18.200
I mean it.

12:36.200 --> 12:38.560
You've still got her jacket.

12:38.600 --> 12:40.000
I have to get rid of it.

12:40.000 --> 12:40.720
I have to get rid of it.

12:41.920 --> 12:44.400
Oh, my God. Joe, you can't do this.

12:45.400 --> 12:46.920
You've got to help me.

12:47.840 --> 12:48.000
What? We'd be destroying evidence.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.280
What? We'd be destroying evidence.

12:50.320 --> 12:52.000
Exactly.

12:55.080 --> 12:56.000
I can't do this on my own.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.080
I can't do this on my own.

12:58.800 --> 13:01.080
What the fuck?

13:49.640 --> 13:51.400
This proves it.

13:52.200 --> 13:54.440
I can't believe
Joe is capable of murder.

13:55.240 --> 13:57.080
Why burn my jacket
if he's not guilty?

13:57.120 --> 13:59.680
I don't know. I'm not a mind-reader.

14:02.800 --> 14:04.920
I have to find out
what he's planning.

14:04.960 --> 14:08.000
And what he's got over Katie.
She never got over her mum leaving.

14:08.000 --> 14:08.240
And what he's got over Katie.
She never got over her mum leaving.

14:08.280 --> 14:10.480
Now she just
lets people take advantage

14:10.520 --> 14:12.200
like she wants their approval.

14:12.240 --> 14:14.440
Joe always gets his own way.

14:16.760 --> 14:18.920
What's that supposed to mean?

14:21.040 --> 14:22.960
Get your dad
to ask him at the vigil.

14:24.440 --> 14:26.680
He'll never tell Dad anything.

14:37.040 --> 14:39.040
Maybe you could try again.

14:42.120 --> 14:44.200
What happened between you two?

14:46.200 --> 14:48.000
This town infects everyone
and everything.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.880
This town infects everyone
and everything.

14:51.400 --> 14:55.040
We're living our lives
like everything's OK

14:55.080 --> 14:56.000
but under the surface it's...

14:56.000 --> 14:57.080
but under the surface it's...

14:57.840 --> 14:59.160
It's what?

14:59.200 --> 15:02.520
We're just pretending...
cos it's never OK.

15:07.240 --> 15:08.880
So why come back?

15:10.840 --> 15:12.000
We've all got to face our demons...
sooner or later.

15:12.000 --> 15:15.600
We've all got to face our demons...
sooner or later.

15:23.280 --> 15:26.240
Will you come to the club,
to the vigil?

15:26.280 --> 15:28.000
I'm not great with crowds,
especially that one.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.600
I'm not great with crowds,
especially that one.

15:33.160 --> 15:35.200
I could really use a friend.

15:38.360 --> 15:40.360
I don't even know you.

15:56.840 --> 15:58.800
What we got?

15:58.840 --> 16:00.000
Fragments from Neve's necklace
were found inside the boat.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.520
Fragments from Neve's necklace
were found inside the boat.

16:02.560 --> 16:04.200
So it was used to move her body.

16:04.240 --> 16:06.400
Quite a few people
had access to the boathouse,

16:06.440 --> 16:08.000
but only two
were connected to Neve.

16:08.000 --> 16:08.160
but only two
were connected to Neve.

16:08.200 --> 16:11.640
One was Daniel Sands,
who took his son out sailing.

16:11.680 --> 16:13.440
And Joseph.

16:14.840 --> 16:16.000
Joe works there sometimes.

16:16.000 --> 16:16.840
Joe works there sometimes.

16:18.480 --> 16:21.120
And by extension,
that gives Joe's father, Michael,

16:21.160 --> 16:23.080
and the entire Sands family, access.

16:23.120 --> 16:24.000
You know Michael was away
on business that night.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.280
You know Michael was away
on business that night.

16:26.320 --> 16:29.400
Yep, and we've called the hotel
and the alibi checks out.

16:29.440 --> 16:32.000
Daniel Sands
is a person of interest, though.

16:32.000 --> 16:32.520
Daniel Sands
is a person of interest, though.

16:32.560 --> 16:34.360
With his history.
His first wife.

16:34.400 --> 16:37.760
We established Dan had nothing
to do with Victoria's disappearance.

16:37.800 --> 16:40.000
Any sign of the jacket she was
wearing when she disappeared?

16:40.000 --> 16:41.640
Any sign of the jacket she was
wearing when she disappeared?

16:41.680 --> 16:44.440
Nothing yet. Forensics
are checking out the tip

16:44.480 --> 16:46.720
and we're screening
local rubbish collections.

16:46.760 --> 16:48.000
We need to attend the vigil.
Low key.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.320
We need to attend the vigil.
Low key.

16:49.360 --> 16:52.920
There's always someone who talks
too much when they get emotional.

16:52.960 --> 16:55.280
We'll catch him...sooner or later.

17:12.240 --> 17:14.560
What's going on with you and Joe?

17:16.960 --> 17:18.960
It's his problem, not mine.

17:19.680 --> 17:20.000
Well, he's going through a lot.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.960
Well, he's going through a lot.

17:23.280 --> 17:25.000
Aren't we all?

17:34.040 --> 17:35.880
How are you settling in?

17:37.080 --> 17:38.960
Made any friends?

17:40.960 --> 17:42.280
Yeah, loads

17:42.320 --> 17:44.000
They're bashing down the door
to come hang out with me.

17:44.000 --> 17:44.920
They're bashing down the door
to come hang out with me.

17:44.960 --> 17:47.080
You need to get yourself out there.

17:47.120 --> 17:49.040
Start building trust.

17:49.080 --> 17:51.520
It's funny cos I find that
kind of hard these days.

17:52.480 --> 17:54.080
Well, you can trust me.

17:57.360 --> 18:00.000
I'm heading to the vigil.
I'll see you later.

18:00.000 --> 18:00.040
I'm heading to the vigil.
I'll see you later.

18:03.120 --> 18:04.280
Whoo!

18:05.800 --> 18:07.840
It ain't funny!

18:07.880 --> 18:08.000
The louder the music,
the faster you go.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.080
The louder the music,
the faster you go.

18:40.880 --> 18:42.600
You ready?

18:43.360 --> 18:45.040
Yeah.

18:57.280 --> 18:58.760
This is for Neve.

19:36.160 --> 19:37.800
Why'd you come?

19:41.680 --> 19:43.760
I know what it is to be alone.

19:44.760 --> 19:46.800
I'll help you find out
what happened.

20:06.920 --> 20:08.000
You sure you want to be here?

20:08.000 --> 20:08.920
You sure you want to be here?

20:10.040 --> 20:11.920
Don't really have a choice.

20:14.280 --> 20:16.000
I'll make him talk.

20:16.000 --> 20:16.320
I'll make him talk.

20:16.360 --> 20:19.360
I'll take him outside
and punch it out of him.

20:19.400 --> 20:21.000
That's not helpful, is it?

20:21.040 --> 20:22.880
Yeah, we should
go to the police, then.

20:22.920 --> 20:24.000
He burnt the evidence.

20:24.000 --> 20:24.800
He burnt the evidence.

20:24.840 --> 20:26.560
Hey, Tom.

20:26.600 --> 20:28.160
Neve says you can....

20:30.120 --> 20:32.000
Yeah.

20:32.000 --> 20:32.360
Yeah.

20:32.400 --> 20:34.840
Has this kind of thing
ever happened to you before?

20:34.880 --> 20:37.400
Seeing ghosts or whatever?
Don't call me that.

20:38.400 --> 20:40.000
Never saw anything weird
that you couldn't explain?

20:40.000 --> 20:41.560
Never saw anything weird
that you couldn't explain?

20:42.320 --> 20:44.040
How about you?

20:44.080 --> 20:48.000
I never believed in this stuff.
Me neither. Till now.

20:48.000 --> 20:48.240
I never believed in this stuff.
Me neither. Till now.

20:48.280 --> 20:51.800
I just don't get why we can see her
and no-one else can.

20:51.840 --> 20:55.240
Can we please stop talking about me
when I'm standing right here?

21:08.240 --> 21:10.680
Hey, I'll get you a drink.

21:10.720 --> 21:12.000
I'll come find you later.

21:12.000 --> 21:12.720
I'll come find you later.

21:13.720 --> 21:15.680
Oh, forget going to the police.

21:15.720 --> 21:17.600
I just want to make sure you're OK.

21:17.640 --> 21:19.640
Yeah, I'm fine.
You're not, though.

21:20.440 --> 21:22.760
You're acting like you and Neve
never broke up

21:22.800 --> 21:25.120
and it's stressing me out -
keeping secrets.

21:25.160 --> 21:26.960
I've kept plenty of yours.

21:27.840 --> 21:28.000
Nothing like this.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.680
Nothing like this.

21:30.600 --> 21:32.640
No, no, no, no.
We're having this out.

21:33.720 --> 21:35.880
Why did she finish with you?

21:35.920 --> 21:36.000
Don't act the tough guy.
It doesn't suit you.

21:36.000 --> 21:39.040
Don't act the tough guy.
It doesn't suit you.

21:39.080 --> 21:41.320
You're not looking
so tough yourself.

21:41.360 --> 21:43.680
Looks like you're about to lose it
big time.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.240
And I thought you'd be happy
we broke up.

21:49.120 --> 21:51.280
I thought you'd be loving that.

21:52.160 --> 21:53.640
Why would I be happy?

21:55.480 --> 21:57.520
Cos I see how you look at me.

22:02.360 --> 22:04.400
Fucking arsehole.
Whoa!

22:14.640 --> 22:16.000
See if Nicky will talk.

22:16.000 --> 22:16.640
See if Nicky will talk.

22:17.360 --> 22:18.600
How?

22:20.000 --> 22:23.000
I don't know, Dad.
Just strike up a conversation.

22:29.760 --> 22:31.480
OK. I'll be back.

22:37.920 --> 22:40.000
Scary times. If you ever need
a bodyguard, I'm right here.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.360
Scary times. If you ever need
a bodyguard, I'm right here.

22:44.320 --> 22:47.600
Hey, I'm being friendly.
You're being a twat.

22:48.840 --> 22:51.920
Heard you were back.
They should've left you to rot.

22:52.960 --> 22:55.040
Fuck off. Go on.

23:02.360 --> 23:04.000
I'm Alex. A friend of Neve's.

23:04.000 --> 23:04.720
I'm Alex. A friend of Neve's.

23:04.760 --> 23:07.240
I'm really sorry
you're having to deal with this.

23:08.920 --> 23:11.400
Say you know me
from Tuesday art class.

23:11.440 --> 23:12.000
We did art class together.
She always talked about you.

23:12.000 --> 23:14.640
We did art class together.
She always talked about you.

23:15.520 --> 23:17.240
Really?

23:19.080 --> 23:20.000
Painted a picture of a girl
and called her Cricket.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.640
Painted a picture of a girl
and called her Cricket.

23:21.680 --> 23:24.680
I remember she painted
a stunning picture of this girl

23:24.720 --> 23:26.680
and she called her Cricket.

23:27.440 --> 23:28.000
That's what she used to call me.
You meant a lot to her.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.160
That's what she used to call me.
You meant a lot to her.

23:31.240 --> 23:33.400
I know she'd want you safe.

23:34.080 --> 23:36.000
I want to help.
With what?

23:36.000 --> 23:36.720
I want to help.
With what?

23:36.760 --> 23:39.120
Whatever's going on
with you and Joe.

23:39.880 --> 23:41.840
Tell her we'll protect her. It's OK.

23:41.880 --> 23:44.000
You don't have to be scared.
I won't let him hurt you.

23:44.000 --> 23:44.120
You don't have to be scared.
I won't let him hurt you.

23:44.160 --> 23:46.800
I don't know
what you're talking about.

23:48.560 --> 23:50.080
The jacket.

23:52.360 --> 23:54.680
Joe made you burn her jacket.

23:57.280 --> 24:00.000
What... How do you know?
Who told you that?

24:00.000 --> 24:00.200
What... How do you know?
Who told you that?

24:03.800 --> 24:05.880
What's going on?

24:05.920 --> 24:08.000
We're just chatting.

24:08.000 --> 24:08.240
We're just chatting.

24:08.280 --> 24:10.560
You seem kind of stressed out.

24:10.600 --> 24:13.800
It's my girlfriend's memorial, so...

24:17.280 --> 24:19.640
Did you burn Neve's jacket?

24:21.960 --> 24:23.760
I didn't tell her.

24:24.480 --> 24:26.720
What the fuck did you do, Joseph?

24:27.720 --> 24:29.600
You've got a nerve.

24:30.320 --> 24:32.000
Please tell me
this isn't what I'm thinking.

24:32.000 --> 24:32.920
Please tell me
this isn't what I'm thinking.

24:33.680 --> 24:37.760
The only killer I can see
round here...is you.

24:54.040 --> 24:56.000
You're a prick.

24:56.000 --> 24:56.040
You're a prick.

25:14.080 --> 25:15.960
Speak to Nicky?

25:16.000 --> 25:18.520
I think he thought
I was hitting on him.

25:18.560 --> 25:20.000
Fuck's sake, Dad.

25:20.040 --> 25:22.480
He's not gonna grass up his mate,
is he?

25:30.440 --> 25:33.600
This isn't a vigil.
It's an excuse for a piss-up.

25:33.640 --> 25:35.840
Yeah. Well, we're here now.

25:35.880 --> 25:36.000
Why don't you give it half an hour?
I'll get the drinks.

25:36.000 --> 25:39.080
Why don't you give it half an hour?
I'll get the drinks.

25:39.800 --> 25:42.000
Can't stand around empty-handed.

25:48.160 --> 25:49.880
You OK, Tom?

25:51.240 --> 25:52.000
Don't really want to be here.

25:52.000 --> 25:53.360
Don't really want to be here.

25:53.400 --> 25:55.680
You and me both.
Max talked me into it.

25:58.000 --> 25:59.240
Listen...

25:59.960 --> 26:00.000
About last night.
Yeah... I'm sorry.

26:00.000 --> 26:03.200
About last night.
Yeah... I'm sorry.

26:03.880 --> 26:07.400
Well...I might have overreacted.

26:08.560 --> 26:11.320
We're all handling this
in our own way.

26:11.360 --> 26:13.240
I don't want to fall out.

26:13.280 --> 26:15.320
Me either.

26:17.560 --> 26:20.280
I'll see how Joan's getting on
with those drinks.

26:20.320 --> 26:22.320
Uh, you want anything?

26:22.360 --> 26:24.000
Uh, yeah. An orange juice.

26:24.000 --> 26:24.640
Uh, yeah. An orange juice.

26:25.800 --> 26:27.480
Thank you.

26:31.440 --> 26:32.000
Yeah, excuse me, please.

26:32.000 --> 26:33.600
Yeah, excuse me, please.

26:34.680 --> 26:37.160
I'd like to thank you all
for coming.

26:39.360 --> 26:40.000
And to remind everyone
why we are here.

26:40.000 --> 26:41.680
And to remind everyone
why we are here.

26:42.640 --> 26:44.360
For Neve.

26:45.160 --> 26:48.000
And I'm sure Neve's family
appreciate your support.

26:48.040 --> 26:50.720
Tom. Would you like
to say something?

26:54.440 --> 26:55.960
Maria?

26:59.680 --> 27:01.680
If you like, I can.

27:13.920 --> 27:15.440
Uh...

27:21.600 --> 27:24.240
I don't know what Neve
would want me to say.

27:25.080 --> 27:27.360
Why don't you tell them to fuck off?

27:29.320 --> 27:31.200
They're vultures.

27:31.240 --> 27:33.000
They don't care about me.

27:34.600 --> 27:36.000
They're just here to gossip
and get pissed.

27:36.000 --> 27:37.040
They're just here to gossip
and get pissed.

27:37.720 --> 27:40.080
Tell them I don't want a vigil.

27:41.400 --> 27:43.640
I want my life back.

27:48.680 --> 27:50.520
I'm sorry. I...

27:51.960 --> 27:52.000
Thanks for coming, though.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.280
Thanks for coming, though.

27:56.480 --> 27:58.320
Yeah, uh, thank you, Tom.

27:58.360 --> 28:00.000
Now, if we can raise a glass.

28:00.000 --> 28:00.480
Now, if we can raise a glass.

28:04.040 --> 28:06.840
To Neve.
To Neve.

28:13.040 --> 28:14.800
Cheers.

28:16.200 --> 28:18.240
You want to come back with us?

28:19.040 --> 28:21.280
No, I'll just stay here for a bit.

28:34.120 --> 28:36.240
Double vodka, please, mate.

28:38.800 --> 28:40.000
There you go.
Cheers.

28:40.000 --> 28:40.600
There you go.
Cheers.

28:57.320 --> 28:59.800
Can't be easy being back here.

29:00.960 --> 29:03.400
I don't know what you're on about.

29:03.440 --> 29:04.000
I'm living my best life.

29:04.000 --> 29:05.400
I'm living my best life.

29:07.760 --> 29:11.240
I've landed my dream job
in a shitty garage.

29:12.040 --> 29:14.560
My parents treat me like I'm five...

29:15.320 --> 29:17.360
..and everyone fuckin' hates me.

29:24.520 --> 29:26.960
I know how it feels
to be the outsider.

29:27.960 --> 29:28.000
But you and me,
we're stronger than the lot of them.

29:28.000 --> 29:31.360
But you and me,
we're stronger than the lot of them.

29:35.200 --> 29:36.000
Look, I'm...

29:36.000 --> 29:37.160
Look, I'm...

29:37.200 --> 29:38.840
I'm no-one special...

29:40.440 --> 29:43.320
..but I'm here if you need. OK?

29:44.720 --> 29:46.440
I'm fine. Thanks.

29:49.480 --> 29:51.520
As long as you're sure.

29:53.280 --> 29:55.280
Actually... Sorry.

30:01.120 --> 30:03.240
I'm not fine at all.

30:11.560 --> 30:13.640
Joseph, can we talk outside, please?

30:15.000 --> 30:16.000
Why?
I'll explain outside.

30:16.000 --> 30:17.040
Why?
I'll explain outside.

30:17.080 --> 30:20.440
Well, I don't want to go.
I'll arrest you here if I have to.

30:20.480 --> 30:23.240
I haven't done anything.
I'm not going anywhere.

30:23.280 --> 30:24.000
Fine. Joseph Wyatt, I'm arresting
you on suspicion of murder.

30:24.000 --> 30:27.160
Fine. Joseph Wyatt, I'm arresting
you on suspicion of murder.

30:27.200 --> 30:29.560
You do not have to say anything,
but it may harm your defence

30:29.600 --> 30:32.000
if you do not mention
when questioned something which
you later rely on in court.

30:32.000 --> 30:32.400
if you do not mention
when questioned something which
you later rely on in court.

30:32.440 --> 30:34.200
Do you understand?
Turn around.

30:34.240 --> 30:36.680
Get the fuck off me! William!

30:36.720 --> 30:38.600
Joseph, calm down.
Do something!

30:38.640 --> 30:40.000
I said get the fuck off me!
Be much better if you came quietly.

30:40.000 --> 30:42.160
I said get the fuck off me!
Be much better if you came quietly.

30:42.200 --> 30:44.640
I haven't done anything!
What are you doing?

30:44.680 --> 30:46.640
He hasn't done anything.
What's happened?

30:46.680 --> 30:48.000
I'll explain at the station.

30:48.000 --> 30:48.520
I'll explain at the station.

30:48.560 --> 30:49.880
Not again.

30:50.600 --> 30:53.640
We'll sort it. Just go with it.
I don't understand. Why Joe?

31:24.880 --> 31:26.640
Stop!

31:28.600 --> 31:30.720
What happened?

31:49.280 --> 31:52.000
In your statement, you said the last
time you remembered seeing Neve

31:52.000 --> 31:53.040
In your statement, you said the last
time you remembered seeing Neve

31:53.080 --> 31:55.160
was at around 11pm.

31:55.200 --> 31:58.920
"She was having a good time dancing
and then she went to get some food.

31:58.960 --> 32:00.000
Everything was fine."

32:00.000 --> 32:00.600
Everything was fine."

32:02.000 --> 32:04.400
Was there anything else
you need to tell us?

32:07.560 --> 32:08.000
No.
Thing is, Joseph...

32:08.000 --> 32:10.440
No.
Thing is, Joseph...

32:11.320 --> 32:15.440
..we have a witness who saw you
arguing with Neve at45pm.

32:15.480 --> 32:16.000
A proper blazing row.

32:16.000 --> 32:17.640
A proper blazing row.

32:19.320 --> 32:22.320
So it doesn't really seem like
everything was fine.

32:23.880 --> 32:24.000
Talk to us...

32:24.000 --> 32:25.680
Talk to us...

32:25.720 --> 32:28.600
tell us the truth...
and this can all be over.

32:31.200 --> 32:32.000
Did you destroy Neve's jacket?

32:32.000 --> 32:33.280
Did you destroy Neve's jacket?

32:35.400 --> 32:36.920
Did you?

32:43.960 --> 32:45.800
Joseph?

32:50.360 --> 32:52.480
What the fuck?

32:57.120 --> 32:59.000
Did you murder Neve Kelly?

33:01.440 --> 33:03.040
No.

33:04.480 --> 33:06.200
I loved her.

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
Neve,
what happened back there?

33:12.000 --> 33:12.440
Neve,
what happened back there?

33:13.120 --> 33:15.120
Did YOU do that?

33:17.120 --> 33:19.120
I think so.

33:19.160 --> 33:20.000
There was this noise.

33:20.000 --> 33:21.200
There was this noise.

33:22.680 --> 33:24.960
It got into my head and I...

33:25.760 --> 33:28.000
..just couldn't get rid of it.
What noise?

33:28.000 --> 33:28.160
..just couldn't get rid of it.
What noise?

33:29.920 --> 33:31.680
Like this...

33:32.960 --> 33:35.000
..scratching sound.

33:37.080 --> 33:39.040
Only worse, really.

33:44.360 --> 33:46.480
What's she doing here?

33:49.240 --> 33:51.600
This is crazy.
He didn't do anything.

33:51.640 --> 33:52.000
He was at the party all night.

33:52.000 --> 33:53.360
He was at the party all night.

33:53.400 --> 33:55.200
You can't know that for certain.

33:55.240 --> 33:58.120
And at the very least,
he's destroyed potential evidence.

33:58.160 --> 34:00.000
Boss.
Don't go anywhere, please.

34:00.000 --> 34:00.080
Boss.
Don't go anywhere, please.

34:00.120 --> 34:03.320
I'll need to talk to you again
about Joseph's recent behaviour.

34:07.840 --> 34:08.000
I know you can't hear me but...

34:08.000 --> 34:10.040
I know you can't hear me but...

34:10.760 --> 34:12.680
..I love you.

34:13.400 --> 34:16.000
Whatever you know about Joseph,
just...tell them.

34:16.000 --> 34:16.480
Whatever you know about Joseph,
just...tell them.

34:18.320 --> 34:19.640
OK?

34:22.720 --> 34:24.000
Hi, Katie. Thanks for coming down.

34:24.000 --> 34:25.480
Hi, Katie. Thanks for coming down.

34:27.560 --> 34:29.880
What can I help you with?

34:31.080 --> 34:32.000
Everyone's gonna hate me.

34:32.000 --> 34:33.280
Everyone's gonna hate me.

34:33.320 --> 34:35.320
What makes you think that?

34:36.640 --> 34:38.240
I lied on my statement.

34:39.840 --> 34:40.000
OK. Well...shall we start over?

34:40.000 --> 34:43.320
OK. Well...shall we start over?

34:43.360 --> 34:46.000
I just want to do the right thing.

34:46.040 --> 34:48.000
What do you know, Katie?

34:48.000 --> 34:48.240
What do you know, Katie?

34:50.600 --> 34:52.840
Has someone put you up to this?

34:57.520 --> 34:59.560
Joe didn't kill Neve.

35:03.480 --> 35:04.000
He was with me.
What?!

35:04.000 --> 35:06.160
He was with me.
What?!

35:06.200 --> 35:08.880
Joseph Wyatt was with you?

35:08.920 --> 35:10.880
All night...

35:10.920 --> 35:12.000
in his caravan.

35:12.000 --> 35:12.800
in his caravan.

35:12.840 --> 35:14.520
Doing what?
You know what!

35:14.560 --> 35:16.480
I'm gonna need you to say it.

35:16.520 --> 35:18.200
No.

35:18.240 --> 35:20.000
Having sex.

35:20.000 --> 35:20.040
Having sex.

35:22.760 --> 35:24.920
We left the party together.

35:26.080 --> 35:27.920
Joe's innocent.

35:51.200 --> 35:52.000
They're releasing Joe.

35:52.000 --> 35:53.200
They're releasing Joe.

35:55.720 --> 35:57.400
Why?

36:01.000 --> 36:03.520
I trusted her.

36:03.560 --> 36:05.600
I'm so sorry.

36:06.720 --> 36:08.000
It's like...my life was a lie

36:08.000 --> 36:09.600
It's like...my life was a lie

36:09.640 --> 36:11.840
and I'm only just finding out now.

36:14.800 --> 36:16.000
So, Joe didn't kill you.

36:16.000 --> 36:16.800
So, Joe didn't kill you.

36:17.600 --> 36:19.840
Part of me's glad.

36:19.880 --> 36:22.080
Part of me
wants to punch his face in.

36:25.440 --> 36:27.680
Oh, I'm gonna be in so much shit.

36:31.360 --> 36:32.000
I'm really sorry.
It's fine.

36:32.000 --> 36:33.520
I'm really sorry.
It's fine.

36:34.320 --> 36:36.200
I told the truth, didn't I?

36:38.360 --> 36:40.000
It was tough for you today.

36:40.000 --> 36:40.520
It was tough for you today.

36:41.800 --> 36:43.720
Being there with all those people.

36:45.000 --> 36:46.480
You know why?

36:46.520 --> 36:48.000
This is a small town...

36:48.000 --> 36:48.640
This is a small town...

36:49.880 --> 36:52.040
..with a lot of big mouths.

36:57.520 --> 36:59.320
Thank you.

37:01.920 --> 37:03.920
What for?

37:05.160 --> 37:07.160
For not judging me.

37:11.680 --> 37:12.000
The past is done.

37:12.000 --> 37:13.680
The past is done.

37:14.640 --> 37:16.640
There's no going back.

37:22.600 --> 37:25.200
There's something
I need to tell you.

37:29.840 --> 37:32.160
She showed me these photos.

37:35.320 --> 37:36.000
All Neve's injuries.

37:36.000 --> 37:37.360
All Neve's injuries.

37:39.280 --> 37:41.520
Asked if I did that to her.

37:45.240 --> 37:47.480
I've got these pictures
in my head for ever.

37:47.520 --> 37:49.520
You've got to be strong now, son.

37:50.400 --> 37:52.000
You've done nothing wrong.
You're a good person.

37:52.000 --> 37:53.200
You've done nothing wrong.
You're a good person.

37:58.040 --> 38:00.000
No, I'm not.
Hey.

38:00.000 --> 38:00.080
No, I'm not.
Hey.

38:09.800 --> 38:12.600
Mum and Dad were so ashamed
of what I'd done.

38:14.280 --> 38:16.000
Guess three years in juvie
was the least I deserved.

38:16.000 --> 38:17.280
Guess three years in juvie
was the least I deserved.

38:20.360 --> 38:23.800
I'm still here and Danny's...

38:28.240 --> 38:30.360
He's dead because of me.

38:33.120 --> 38:36.520
And it fucking haunts me
every single day

38:36.560 --> 38:38.640
cos I can't bring him back.

38:39.800 --> 38:40.000
Come on, push it! Push it!

38:40.000 --> 38:41.800
Come on, push it! Push it!

38:42.680 --> 38:44.760
Faster! Faster!
Joe! Stop it!

38:44.800 --> 38:48.000
Joe. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

38:48.000 --> 38:48.160
Joe. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

38:48.200 --> 38:51.480
Sometimes I think
even if I served...

38:52.680 --> 38:54.520
..ten years...

38:56.040 --> 38:58.280
..the guilt would still be there.

38:58.960 --> 39:01.160
And so it should.

39:03.280 --> 39:04.000
'And I know Joe feels it too.'

39:04.000 --> 39:05.520
'And I know Joe feels it too.'

39:09.160 --> 39:11.240
I know I can't make it right...

39:12.680 --> 39:14.560
..but I can help you.

39:18.280 --> 39:20.000
I think I'm meant to help.

39:20.000 --> 39:20.480
I think I'm meant to help.

39:24.160 --> 39:27.840
You just being here is helping me.
No, there's something else.

39:29.240 --> 39:32.400
That sound at the vigil...

39:33.400 --> 39:34.920
..that...

39:34.960 --> 39:36.000
scratching...

39:36.000 --> 39:36.600
scratching...

39:37.320 --> 39:39.480
..I heard it, too...

39:40.240 --> 39:42.280
..and I think I've heard it before.

39:44.520 --> 39:46.120
Here.

40:21.480 --> 40:23.360
Joe?

40:46.200 --> 40:48.000
I heard it
when I came out of the lake.

40:48.000 --> 40:48.520
I heard it
when I came out of the lake.

40:50.120 --> 40:52.040
Felt something...

40:53.120 --> 40:55.000
..watching me.

41:03.120 --> 41:04.000
There's something in the woods.

41:04.000 --> 41:05.480
There's something in the woods.

41:52.880 --> 41:55.880
