00:03.000 --> 00:06.277
They came from the far
corners of the world:

00:06.640 --> 00:09.474
Europe, Australia, America.

00:10.000 --> 00:15.460
All drawn by the lure of
gold, discovered in the hills

00:15.480 --> 00:19.713
of South Africa where big
game roamed in their thousands

00:19.920 --> 00:24.039
and the wildest tales were true.

00:26.000 --> 00:32.073

02:07.120 --> 02:08.780
You get him, you get him champ!

02:08.800 --> 02:10.757
Yes! Yes, you win!

02:10.960 --> 02:14.510
Pull! Pull champ!

02:14.920 --> 02:18.072
Into that world was
born a litter of puppies.

02:18.280 --> 02:20.020
"Shorty you don't think you're gonna Shorty
you don't think you're gonna win do you?"

02:20.040 --> 02:23.238
And one of these pups
stood out from the others,

02:23.480 --> 02:26.200
not by size, because he was the
smallest, and not by beauty either,

02:26.760 --> 02:30.436
because he was an odd
looking little fellow.

02:30.680 --> 02:33.740
You're really silly.

02:33.760 --> 02:36.070
He stood out because of his heart.

02:38.400 --> 02:42.792
His was the biggest, the
bravest heart in all of Africa.

02:58.320 --> 03:03.980
So young and you think
you've got all the answers!

03:04.000 --> 03:07.596
If only life were that simple.

03:07.760 --> 03:14.030
Before our time, man lived
in harmony with animals.

03:14.800 --> 03:19.158
We could communicate and
understand one another.

03:20.800 --> 03:23.940
But man wanted more; man

03:23.960 --> 03:25.519
wanted control.

03:27.840 --> 03:31.516
You animals will pay the price.

03:35.760 --> 03:37.956
I was on my own for the first time,

03:40.520 --> 03:45.549
and I was in no way prepared for an
adventure such as this. But I was lucky.

03:51.240 --> 03:54.551
I had as my driver
and guide Jim Makokel.

03:55.120 --> 03:57.060
Jim was a proud Zulu warrior.

03:57.080 --> 03:58.833
Come On. It's for us.

03:59.280 --> 04:02.000
Hey! Get away!
- It's him!

04:04.240 --> 04:08.820
What do you mean? It's the
runt. We need the champion!

04:08.840 --> 04:13.631
Don't look at the size! It's
what's in here... And here!

04:14.560 --> 04:18.759
He was as brave and as
reckless as the day was long.

04:23.520 --> 04:25.989
Jim's affection for the dog, puzzled me,

04:26.240 --> 04:29.312
I didn't understand why because
he was the smallest of the litter.

04:32.880 --> 04:35.600
The pup's mother shared a
special affnity with the

04:35.760 --> 04:37.274
little fellow too.

04:44.440 --> 04:46.238
What's a runt mom?

04:46.760 --> 04:49.275
Oh, where did you hear that?

04:50.080 --> 04:51.799
They were talking about me.

04:52.360 --> 04:54.380
It just means you're small.

04:54.400 --> 04:58.633
It's not how big you are on the
outside. It's how big you are in here.

04:58.800 --> 05:03.140
Your father was the smallest. The
others teased him, called him the runt.

05:03.160 --> 05:05.914
He became the bravest and best of all.

05:06.400 --> 05:10.189
Just believe in yourself and
no one can make you feel small.

05:11.800 --> 05:12.711
I'll try.

05:13.280 --> 05:15.556
There's my big brave boy!

05:25.360 --> 05:26.396
What is it?

05:27.080 --> 05:29.356
You're going with Fitz and Jim.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.229
What do you mean?

05:31.920 --> 05:35.550
We talked about this. They're
leaving in the morning.

05:36.200 --> 05:37.919
So I'm not going.

05:38.520 --> 05:40.020
I don't want you to go,

05:40.040 --> 05:42.032
but it's something we all have to do.

05:42.840 --> 05:45.100
I left my mother and went with Baba,

05:45.120 --> 05:50.320
now it's time for you to leave and
go with Fitz. It's all apart of life.

05:51.440 --> 05:53.796
You just wanna get rid
of me cuz I'm small.

05:54.440 --> 05:58.940
No! Baba chose you first overall
your brothers and sisters.

05:58.960 --> 06:02.260
It's an honour. Pezulu is going too,

06:02.280 --> 06:03.555
he'll watch out for you.

06:04.120 --> 06:06.635
Yeah! I'll take care of you
little buddy. It'll be fun.

06:06.840 --> 06:09.820
We'll see the world! Have
adventures! Get tattoos!

06:09.840 --> 06:12.355
Pezulu!

06:12.520 --> 06:14.830
Oh, you're in good hands
puppy. Well actually,

06:15.000 --> 06:17.469
they're wings. Well they kinda look
more like claws, but don't worry;

06:17.640 --> 06:20.599
they don't hurt. They're just feathers!

06:20.760 --> 06:23.878
In fact I can't really pick anything up with them
at all, I usually have to use my feet to grab things...

06:24.040 --> 06:27.590
and ah..well I er..uhoh,
what were we talking about?

06:28.040 --> 06:31.660
Take care of him Pezulu. He
doesn't understand man yet.

06:31.680 --> 06:34.400
Oh well now don't you
worry none. He'll be fine.

06:34.560 --> 06:36.358
Fitz is a good man. Trying to
find his way in the world...

06:38.720 --> 06:41.679
Clumsy as a three legged
warthog, but he means well.

06:42.760 --> 06:44.399
He'll need you.

06:44.560 --> 06:47.029
Come on, I'll introduce
ya. He's gonna love you.

06:47.200 --> 06:49.032
I wanna stay with you.

06:50.040 --> 06:52.475
I'll always love you, but it's
time for you to live your life.

06:52.680 --> 06:55.275
Besides I'll see you in a few months

06:55.440 --> 06:59.559
at Baba's kraal in the mountains.

07:00.160 --> 07:00.991
Come.

07:02.760 --> 07:05.275
Now don't you worry! You're
going to see all sorts

07:05.480 --> 07:06.596
of new things, it's gonna be fun.

07:06.760 --> 07:08.513
Hey, you like hens?

07:08.680 --> 07:11.240
It's hard to imagine what it must
of felt like for that little pup.

07:11.400 --> 07:15.020
He was being forced to trade everything
he loved for something completely unknown.

07:15.040 --> 07:18.238
So you're taking the puppy?
- Yebo Baba

07:18.400 --> 07:19.820
You have chosen well.

07:19.840 --> 07:24.551
Baba has given you... the champion!

07:25.480 --> 07:27.995
Thank you! Where is he?

07:36.080 --> 07:39.391
This isn't the champion. It's the runt!

07:42.320 --> 07:46.473
Awithandi. Baba sees it. I see it...

07:47.240 --> 07:49.152
...and so will you.

08:22.920 --> 08:26.391
Hey Pezulu! Look at me!

08:27.760 --> 08:30.673
Hey! He's got the Puppy!
He's got the puppy! Puppy!

08:32.240 --> 08:33.356
Ow! Hey!

08:35.520 --> 08:37.239
Let me go!

08:37.600 --> 08:40.910
I didn't see the point in chasing
after him. How could he survive?

08:41.400 --> 08:42.820
Put me down!

08:42.840 --> 08:46.460
They say that when an animal finds itself
in the clutches of a large predator...

08:46.480 --> 08:49.980
they will give up and surrender.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.480
I'm not scared of you!

08:53.080 --> 08:53.911
Bully!

08:56.160 --> 08:57.799
This little puppy was different.

08:57.960 --> 09:02.955
He didn't understand the meaning of
surrender and he was not going to give up.

09:34.800 --> 09:38.430
Mom? Mom? Mom?

10:18.960 --> 10:22.700
Whats that in your mouth you
dirty scavenger? Well never,

10:22.720 --> 10:24.996
where'd you come from?

10:25.160 --> 10:30.076
What are we gonna do with this Snarly?

10:30.240 --> 10:32.550
Won't survive out here.

10:33.640 --> 10:36.075
Might as well put him
out of his misery now.

10:46.640 --> 10:49.997
Leave me alone! Get off!

10:54.640 --> 10:56.313
Now what are you gonna do?

10:57.320 --> 10:58.640
Savage dog!

11:02.480 --> 11:04.870
Mad Zulu, where'd he come from?

11:05.960 --> 11:08.759
Ha. Well that is amazing. We've
been searching for him everywhere!

11:08.920 --> 11:10.593
How'd you get away from that eagle?

11:11.000 --> 11:13.310
You've been running
around looking for this?

11:14.560 --> 11:16.597
Yes. I'm Fitz.

11:17.480 --> 11:20.678
Good to meet you Fritz.
How about a cuppa?

11:21.240 --> 11:22.720
It'll knock your socks off.

11:23.440 --> 11:25.750
Ah no, thanks. You're a hunter?

11:26.680 --> 11:28.900
What's the fuss over this little Mutt?

11:28.920 --> 11:31.310
This little fellow just
escaped a Martial Eagle!

11:32.160 --> 11:34.152
Yeah? Is he your dog.

11:37.120 --> 11:40.900
Jim was right. There was something
special about this little dog.

11:40.920 --> 11:43.389
And I knew that he was meant for me.

11:44.160 --> 11:46.356
Yes, he's my dog.

11:51.800 --> 11:52.995
What is his name?

11:53.160 --> 11:55.470
Jock. Little Jock.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.195
I like it!

12:09.720 --> 12:10.710
Come on! Haven't got all day.

13:35.320 --> 13:36.993
Get off!

14:30.920 --> 14:33.594
Don't eat anything that's
been dead more than three days.

14:33.760 --> 14:36.020
Don't even talk about a rhinoceros

14:36.040 --> 14:38.600
unless you're close to a tree.

14:58.920 --> 15:00.434
Come on Jock! Let's go!

15:02.440 --> 15:05.353
Ah, it was to bad for Jock, that
his first taste of civilization

15:05.520 --> 15:09.540
was Crooks' Corner. It was a wildplace,

15:09.560 --> 15:14.191
a refuge for those running from the law.
But for Jock, it was just new and exciting.

15:14.640 --> 15:16.836
It's called "Crooks
Corner" for a reason!

15:17.000 --> 15:18.229
It's full of bad people.

15:18.400 --> 15:21.540
I promised your mother puppy and now you
have to promise me you'll stay out of trouble.

15:21.560 --> 15:23.677
Promise?
- Okay.

15:24.000 --> 15:24.877
Promise?

15:25.880 --> 15:28.940
Crooks Corner, Crocodile river,
I'm just saying these names mean

15:28.960 --> 15:31.680
something, baaak! Promise?

15:32.960 --> 15:35.429
Come on! Haven't got all day.

15:35.600 --> 15:37.796
I promise. I'll stay out of trouble.

15:37.960 --> 15:39.314
Come boy, come on!

15:44.560 --> 15:45.710
Come Jock.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.753
Get away! Argh!

16:20.040 --> 16:21.235
Scared?

16:21.400 --> 16:22.720
Are you okay, Jock?

16:23.280 --> 16:25.920
Get off, ya mangy thing!
- Jock, Jock come back here!

16:30.960 --> 16:34.100
Crooks Corner had the
only supply store en route

16:34.120 --> 16:37.352
to the goldfields. It was
run by a greedy and ruthless

16:37.520 --> 16:39.193
trader named Seedling.

16:40.920 --> 16:42.434
Gosh!

16:50.960 --> 16:52.519
Get away! Away!

16:57.560 --> 16:58.596
Woah!

17:07.079 --> 17:08.673
Huh? You'll get sick doing that.

17:08.880 --> 17:12.271
The runt? Didn't think you'd survive.

17:13.040 --> 17:17.380
You might wish you
hadn't. Come meet the boss.

17:17.400 --> 17:21.440
George, the famous "fighting
baboon"of Crooks Corner.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.560
George had toured with a
circus in his early years

17:24.720 --> 17:28.999
and fought against dogs in wagered
battles. He never lost a fight.

17:30.200 --> 17:31.554
That's better, keep up.

17:31.720 --> 17:34.554
In all this time you get back
with a few skins and useless horns?

17:35.560 --> 17:36.596
What are we gonna do with these?

17:36.760 --> 17:39.480
Well I thought you may need them.

17:39.640 --> 17:43.953
We need ivory! Alright?
This ain't a petshop.

17:46.640 --> 17:47.700
What happened to you?

17:47.720 --> 17:49.393
Get away from here!

17:50.000 --> 17:52.435
Someone new in town George.

17:54.240 --> 17:56.596
Hey hey! What are you doing with them?

17:57.000 --> 17:58.673
None of your business, runt.

17:58.840 --> 18:00.638
Why don't you pick on
someone your own size!

18:04.720 --> 18:05.631
Careful Jock!

18:06.520 --> 18:08.500
Hey wena, haisuga wena!

18:08.520 --> 18:10.159
Hello, Fitzpatrick's the name...

18:10.320 --> 18:13.950
My first encounter with Mr. Seedling
was neither warm or welcoming.

18:15.040 --> 18:17.635
I..um..I brought this
crate up from the coast.

18:22.800 --> 18:26.396
Ah yes, been expecting this.

18:26.560 --> 18:28.279
I'd like a pan and shovel please...

18:29.960 --> 18:31.394
...and a bag of salt.

18:34.440 --> 18:37.274
You've got more chance
of HIM finding gold.

18:37.760 --> 18:39.558
We're going to find gold boy.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.400
Come see where we are going.

18:48.400 --> 18:52.180
This is where I arrived
Jock, on a ship like this.

18:52.200 --> 18:55.750
And that's where we met. Crooks'Corner.

18:55.960 --> 18:57.952
This is Jim's Kraal,
where your mother lives.

18:58.120 --> 19:02.220
We'll see her soon. And
this is where we're going.

19:02.240 --> 19:04.516
Pilgrim's Rest, Gold by the ton!

19:04.680 --> 19:06.592
That's where you are.

19:10.200 --> 19:11.793
What's this?

19:12.000 --> 19:15.198
Jock! He's my dog, cleverest
dog you'll ever meet!

19:15.720 --> 19:20.920
Blow me down, it survived.

19:21.120 --> 19:23.237
Well if he gets any bigger,

19:23.680 --> 19:26.354
George can have a little sport.

19:27.440 --> 19:29.318
Are you a missionary?

19:29.520 --> 19:34.380
Not at all. I'm going to make my
fortune in gold. Pilgrims Rest!

19:34.400 --> 19:36.980
The only way you'll find gold,

19:37.000 --> 19:39.959
is if you pick it outta my teeth!

19:44.400 --> 19:46.198
Stay close.

19:47.400 --> 19:50.900
Ah, Miss Morris! How are you, luv?

19:50.920 --> 19:53.560
Ewgh! I detest this place.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.753
I've come for my books.
- They're here!

19:55.960 --> 19:57.030
Excuse me?

19:57.200 --> 19:58.429
I mean, in the crate, we brought...

19:58.600 --> 20:00.239
Just arrived from the coast,

20:00.400 --> 20:03.120
they'll be with you
on our next delivery!

20:03.880 --> 20:05.439
Hey, I'm Jock.

20:05.640 --> 20:10.396
Who do you think you are?
Scruffy little thing? Humph!

20:13.480 --> 20:14.436
Hello.

20:25.680 --> 20:26.591
Hey.

20:28.240 --> 20:30.630
So you come here often?

20:32.280 --> 20:33.396
Nice place.

20:35.080 --> 20:38.437
Get out of my way. Hey there, Pol!

20:39.080 --> 20:43.279
Do not call me that! My name
is Polly. Miss Polly to you.

20:43.440 --> 20:47.940
How long you in town darl... er... Polly?

20:47.960 --> 20:51.590
Get away you vile dog!
Get away! Come on Polly.

20:53.360 --> 20:58.913
Off you go! Don't want you
mixing with these mongrels.

21:00.240 --> 21:02.118
Stay away from her.

21:02.320 --> 21:04.220
Tell me the odds, Seedling!

21:04.240 --> 21:07.995
Ah, Mr. Morris. The favorite is yellow.

21:08.520 --> 21:13.151
Yellow! Awful colour! I'll take blue!

21:15.440 --> 21:17.636
We just arrived recently,
we're looking for gold.

21:17.800 --> 21:19.120
Been here long?

21:19.600 --> 21:23.740
About half a day and still after these
races we're going to have to be heading back.

21:23.760 --> 21:25.592
I can't wait.

21:26.960 --> 21:29.191
Hello Polly! Where have you been?

21:30.160 --> 21:33.198
I suggest you place your bet,

21:33.360 --> 21:36.820
and remove your dog.
- Father! Don't be rude.

21:36.840 --> 21:40.100
This is Mr. Fitzpatrick.
He's here for the races.

21:40.120 --> 21:42.740
Pleased to make your acquaintance sir...
- Mr. Morris.

21:42.760 --> 21:44.319
I'd like to place this on blue please.

21:46.120 --> 21:50.160
Break the bank?

21:51.400 --> 21:53.357
I'm sorry, it's all I have.

21:54.200 --> 21:57.140
Don't worry boy, we're
going to make a fortune.

21:57.160 --> 21:58.958
Here's to blue!

21:59.160 --> 22:02.119
Blue! Blue! Blue!

22:09.040 --> 22:11.430
So you've seen this before,
Jim, it all looks like fun.

22:11.640 --> 22:13.472
We'll prepare to leave in the morning.

22:14.480 --> 22:15.755
Hello.

22:17.840 --> 22:20.309
Pezulu, what's bothering you?

22:20.520 --> 22:23.780
Everything. Everything
about this place bothers me.

22:23.800 --> 22:25.980
Especially that baboon, you
know what he does don't you?

22:26.000 --> 22:27.116
He fights dogs!

22:28.360 --> 22:31.000
Hey George! Bet on me mate!

22:33.880 --> 22:36.236
Keep an eye on things
here, I'll be right back.

22:37.840 --> 22:40.275
Settle, George, settle!

22:41.400 --> 22:43.869
There'll be champagne after this one.

22:45.560 --> 22:47.597
Huh, what's he up to?

22:48.120 --> 22:50.020
Whatever it is, it's got
nothing to do with us.

22:50.040 --> 22:51.940
Stop worrying Pezulu, he's tied up!

22:51.960 --> 22:53.340
Jock, I promised your mother...

22:53.360 --> 22:55.795
This will be amazing!

22:57.040 --> 22:58.500
Hello Lillian!
- Oh hello!

22:58.520 --> 23:01.500
Camptown ladies sing this
song! Doo-da, Doo-da, Doo-da!

23:01.520 --> 23:04.580
Camptown racetracks come
along! Oh, de doo-da day!

23:04.600 --> 23:07.593
Come on, it'll soon be over.

23:07.800 --> 23:10.740
Don't worry! Be Happy!

23:10.760 --> 23:14.674
Now that's Basil, now he used to be in the
circus with George, he's an entertainer.

23:15.960 --> 23:20.193
A little rearranging of the colours.

23:22.440 --> 23:23.590
Fine.

23:25.680 --> 23:27.380
Where's Wart?

23:27.400 --> 23:28.550
What's he doing?

23:30.640 --> 23:33.997
Let's make this a handicap race.

23:37.920 --> 23:39.957
The thorn! Why did he do that?

23:40.360 --> 23:43.114
That's the colour Fitz bet
on. He'll lose all his money.

23:43.280 --> 23:46.432
What are you looking
at? Get away from here!

23:47.400 --> 23:51.440
You look gorgeous, you look absolutely
gorgeous! Keep your colours on!

23:51.600 --> 23:55.514
Keep your colours on! Get into
position, where the jockeys?

23:56.640 --> 23:57.710
Look at them!

24:00.160 --> 24:01.435
They race?

24:03.720 --> 24:04.471
So!

24:04.640 --> 24:06.340
He's a bad man.

24:06.360 --> 24:08.700
Seedling makes money anyway he can.

24:08.720 --> 24:10.120
Oh man, I can't wait!

24:10.320 --> 24:15.111
No, no, this is where you stand.

24:15.560 --> 24:16.835
Keep your tails up boys!

24:17.840 --> 24:20.435
Ah! Don't you do this to me, Wart!

24:20.640 --> 24:22.199
Wart, what is your problem?

24:23.040 --> 24:24.269
I'll do it.

24:24.480 --> 24:28.633
What? No! No. He can't
run. No, he can't!

24:28.800 --> 24:29.916
No! No!

24:30.080 --> 24:31.309
Who are you?

24:32.240 --> 24:33.700
Do what?

24:33.720 --> 24:34.631
Race.

24:34.800 --> 24:38.260
Come here boy, ah, ah, listen,
hold on. Hold on! He won't run!

24:38.280 --> 24:39.620
Let me do it, Basil.

24:39.640 --> 24:41.711
The pig can't race.

24:41.880 --> 24:43.837
Seedling stuck a thorn in his foot!

24:45.760 --> 24:48.740
A thorn? How do you know?

24:48.760 --> 24:50.620
Is it bad?

24:50.640 --> 24:55.112
Oh no! Oh no, no, no,
no. You'll be fine.

24:55.800 --> 24:58.110
Here. Bite on this.

25:01.960 --> 25:05.032
How's that, hmm? Can you run?

25:05.520 --> 25:07.557
Basil! I'll run.

25:08.240 --> 25:09.469
You can't!

25:09.640 --> 25:11.518
Ah, someone's coming, someone's coming!

25:11.680 --> 25:15.594
Oh Jock! Oh, we're gonna
get in trouble now.

25:15.760 --> 25:17.638
Come on, Basil.

25:18.280 --> 25:22.180
Oh you... Here.

25:22.200 --> 25:25.671
S'truth! OK you messy bunch, get ready!

25:27.000 --> 25:32.075
Ah, the runt, someone
for you to beat Snarly.

25:36.720 --> 25:37.517
Hmmm, thanks.

25:39.480 --> 25:41.700
One of the singular things about

25:41.720 --> 25:45.860
distant outposts of civilization is the way that
the people there adapt to the local environment.

25:45.880 --> 25:50.397
There were few horses to be had
then, but warthogs were plentiful

25:50.560 --> 25:54.190
so they developed this
new form of racing.

25:54.520 --> 25:58.833
The residents of Crooks Corner
took this derby quite seriously.

25:59.000 --> 26:01.913
Ah. The thrill of racing.

26:02.360 --> 26:05.080
Yes, it's a little different.

26:05.480 --> 26:09.180
This is Africa, Mr.
Fitzpatrick, nothing is normal!

26:09.200 --> 26:10.714
Take your seats!

26:15.280 --> 26:17.078
Oh, wait till your
mother hears about this!

26:17.880 --> 26:19.314
Relax, will you, Pezulu?!

26:20.000 --> 26:23.198
She's gonna put me in the chicken soup,

26:23.360 --> 26:26.034
I don't know what she's gonna do with
me, what am I gonna do with myself?

26:26.200 --> 26:29.591
And we're walking and we're
walking and we're stopping.

26:30.080 --> 26:31.434
This is Julian.
- Hi!

26:31.600 --> 26:35.037
Julian is your jockey.
You do not win. OK? OK?

26:36.440 --> 26:40.434
Remember everybody: blue does not win.

26:41.240 --> 26:44.756
He's got no chance.
No runt wins anything!

26:44.920 --> 26:46.070
Yeah right.

26:48.240 --> 26:51.870
OK you lot, wait for the gun...

26:54.760 --> 26:56.479
Drop the stick, Julian, hold on tight.

26:57.320 --> 26:58.879
Hold on. Okay?

27:13.800 --> 27:14.870
Coming through!

27:18.200 --> 27:19.634
What are you doing?

27:19.880 --> 27:22.076
So long, sucker!

27:23.680 --> 27:25.717
I don't see blue father
- What?

27:26.120 --> 27:27.315
Oh wait, here he comes!

27:29.280 --> 27:31.460
Ah! How's my pig doing?

27:31.480 --> 27:32.516
It's a dog.

27:34.360 --> 27:35.900
Eat my dust, Snarly!

27:35.920 --> 27:37.036
I think it's your dog.

27:38.840 --> 27:39.956
I don't think so

27:53.680 --> 27:55.990
Here we go!
- Go Jock, Go! Go!

27:59.520 --> 28:01.671
Go, you dog! Good show!

28:05.240 --> 28:07.118
He'd have won if wasn't
for that pig without a..

28:07.280 --> 28:08.600
Don't get hot and bothered.

28:08.760 --> 28:11.798
A pig without a Jockey is disqualified.

28:16.840 --> 28:17.910
Ha, ha, ha, ha! Look at you!

28:19.120 --> 28:20.260
Oh no.

28:20.280 --> 28:21.031
Excuse me, sir!

28:21.240 --> 28:23.357
This is the champion!
This is the winner!

28:23.520 --> 28:26.220
Well done!

28:26.240 --> 28:28.118
You're number one!

28:34.440 --> 28:37.080
How did he get involved?

28:40.400 --> 28:43.620
Cut it out, Seedling, pay your debts.

28:43.640 --> 28:47.100
Oh apologies, Mr. Morris, but this dog

28:47.120 --> 28:48.315
was not registered.

28:50.640 --> 28:56.910
Registered? Ha ha ha! Since when has
anything been registered in this place?

28:57.360 --> 29:02.037
Mr. Seedling, the dog did not break
the rules and wore your colours.

29:02.520 --> 29:06.355
Mr. Fitzpatrick and I will
receive our money graciously.

29:08.400 --> 29:09.914
Well done my boy!

29:10.400 --> 29:12.392
Jock. Stay with me, stay with me now.

29:17.320 --> 29:19.710
Jock, come on, boy, come on!

29:25.880 --> 29:27.360
Nice race huh?

29:30.600 --> 29:31.750
What happened?

29:31.920 --> 29:34.020
Wart couldn't even stand,

29:34.040 --> 29:35.633
the dog just forced his way in.

29:37.160 --> 29:40.198
Get that runt, then wait for me below.

29:41.040 --> 29:45.020
Now don't stay too long on this island,
terrible place. And you be careful with Seedling.

29:45.040 --> 29:46.793
Oh. Hello Seedling.

29:47.600 --> 29:50.798
Oh Seedling, do not
forget Mr. Fitzpatrick.

29:51.680 --> 29:53.160
Help me up! Let's go, Lillian.

29:54.680 --> 29:55.716
Bye!

29:56.160 --> 29:57.913
Goodbye!
- Bye.

30:03.200 --> 30:06.159
Come on, boy. Thanks for this.

30:08.560 --> 30:10.199
See you back at the camp, Jim!

30:27.840 --> 30:30.620
Pssst. Jockie! Come and
join us, come on boy.

30:30.640 --> 30:33.380
Race party! It's in the
cellar, chips and dips!

30:33.400 --> 30:35.340
No. No we can't.
- Why not?

30:35.360 --> 30:38.990
No. Because we gotta get out of here
before you get us into anymore trouble!

30:39.840 --> 30:44.596
Come and join us, come on boy, the
winner has to be there, it's tradition.

30:44.760 --> 30:45.830
Let's go.

30:46.880 --> 30:50.874
What happened? It was your
job to stay at the baobab

30:51.080 --> 30:52.992
and mind the animals.

30:53.200 --> 30:54.554
How did that dog get in?

30:54.720 --> 30:58.157
When I arrived at the tree,
the dog had the colours on,

30:58.880 --> 31:00.340
Thought you did it!

31:00.360 --> 31:03.592
How did that little mongrel do it?

31:04.760 --> 31:06.877
Home sweet home.

31:07.040 --> 31:09.874
Yes, Jockie, we have an underground
residence. It's an old mineshaft.

31:12.560 --> 31:16.190
Brace yourself, it's partytime!

31:16.960 --> 31:22.718
Ha ha! Look at them baby! Watch your step,
whoop whoop whoop whoop! Easy does it.

31:23.640 --> 31:25.660
Now listen to this catchy song

31:25.680 --> 31:27.512
my little chirpy canine chum.

31:27.840 --> 31:29.593
They're pointing out
where you went wrong

31:29.760 --> 31:31.700
and to join that race was dumb.

31:31.720 --> 31:33.740
And worse than that
you had to go and win,

31:33.760 --> 31:35.433
which was tactless and insane.

31:35.600 --> 31:39.355
You so don't get the mess you're
in, as my chorus will explain.

31:39.600 --> 31:41.114
You shouldn't have done it!

31:41.280 --> 31:43.317
It was coming first that blew it!

31:43.480 --> 31:46.951
And anyway it wasn't up to me.

31:47.200 --> 31:50.955
Jockie, Jockie, Jockie, Jockie,
Jockie, George is going to throw a fit

31:51.240 --> 31:53.180
I told ya, I warned ya,

31:53.200 --> 31:54.860
You shouldn't have done it!

31:54.880 --> 31:56.155
There was cheating going on.

31:57.080 --> 31:58.820
You shouldn't have done it!

31:58.840 --> 32:00.877
You shouldn't have run it!

32:01.040 --> 32:02.952
You shouldn't have done it!
- Come on, Jockie.

32:04.840 --> 32:08.620
If you have plans to grow up son,
which right now I would doubt.

32:08.640 --> 32:12.759
You'll learn what is and isn't
done and that interfering's out.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.435
You should have listened
to my sound advice,

32:18.120 --> 32:20.157
When you're on this island paradise.

32:20.360 --> 32:22.238
Oooh I think

32:22.400 --> 32:24.471
you'd best disappear!

32:24.640 --> 32:26.300
I told you, I warned you,

32:26.320 --> 32:28.039
you shouldn't have done it!

32:33.080 --> 32:34.036
You OK?

32:40.720 --> 32:43.679
Wart thought he'd missed the party.

32:44.480 --> 32:46.233
What have you done to him?

32:46.720 --> 32:51.749
He fell down the stairs, you saw.

32:54.280 --> 32:56.875
What happened today, Basil hmm?

32:59.160 --> 33:04.952
A stray dog joins the race, and wins?

33:05.760 --> 33:08.275
Who said you could run?

33:08.880 --> 33:10.792
The warthog couldn't race.

33:10.960 --> 33:12.838
You were in charge.

33:13.000 --> 33:14.832
It was my idea. Leave him alone.

33:20.560 --> 33:22.836
Stop! Please stop. No no no.

33:23.400 --> 33:25.551
Come here, runt!

33:43.760 --> 33:44.860
Bully.

33:44.880 --> 33:47.440
What did you say!

33:48.040 --> 33:49.440
I said bully.

33:52.600 --> 33:55.354
Oh dear. Oh monkey.

33:56.000 --> 33:58.993
George?
- Hey, I've got an idea.

34:02.880 --> 34:03.996
The beam?

34:10.800 --> 34:14.032
It was a great relief to
leave Crooks Corner behind us,

34:14.840 --> 34:18.460
but to do so we had to
cross the Crocodile River.

34:18.480 --> 34:22.918
I was terrified. Jim, however, was just
delighted to have another opportunity

34:23.120 --> 34:25.635
to display his reckless courage.

34:28.000 --> 34:31.357
Go on. Careful. Wait.

34:32.480 --> 34:34.039
Basophalaphoi.

34:34.840 --> 34:36.114
Be careful Jim!

34:52.239 --> 34:53.980
Masambeni! Donsa!

34:54.000 --> 34:56.833
Baba had once told me that
our actions were as stones

34:57.000 --> 34:58.900
dropped in a pond.

34:58.920 --> 35:02.118
They create ripples that travel
through others in ways we can't control.

35:02.280 --> 35:05.114
That's why it's so important
to listen to our hearts

35:05.280 --> 35:09.354
because he said, that's how the
spirit who Sees All talks to us.

35:10.120 --> 35:12.396
This is the life, eh? Couple of
guys on the road, free as birds.

35:12.560 --> 35:14.620
Well, I am anyway. You're
more like, free as a rock.

35:14.640 --> 35:18.077
Ha ha! Why the long face?

35:19.200 --> 35:20.600
Come on.

35:21.200 --> 35:22.740
I shouldn't have done it.

35:22.760 --> 35:25.958
Well you shouldn't have,
but you did. It's over now.

35:26.440 --> 35:29.700
Bad luck to keep worrying
about the past. Time to move on.

35:29.720 --> 35:31.916
How can I? When I made things worse.

35:32.640 --> 35:34.580
Well you win some, you lose some.

35:34.600 --> 35:37.700
You helped Fitz. But you
put Basil in Hot Water.

35:37.720 --> 35:39.900
He'll survive, probably.

35:39.920 --> 35:41.559
Besides, we're going
to go see your mother!

35:41.720 --> 35:44.030
And I know a couple a hens there who'll
be glad to see me, I'll tell you that.

35:44.240 --> 35:46.755
Fitz, the drums.

35:55.640 --> 35:57.996
Hey, there she is! Hey, there she is!

36:10.600 --> 36:12.140
I've missed you, mom.

36:12.160 --> 36:15.039
Well you certainly didn't tell
me did ya, this one's trouble.

36:16.880 --> 36:18.314
So I've heard.

36:18.760 --> 36:20.274
What are the drums for?

36:24.040 --> 36:26.794
The leopard has killed a
little girl from the village.

36:27.280 --> 36:30.432
If it's got a taste for
humans it'll kill again.

36:35.120 --> 36:36.110
Stay calm.

36:49.560 --> 36:52.200
Time for a quiz.

36:52.960 --> 36:57.000
Right. Who did this?

37:11.320 --> 37:14.233
Anyone else think this is funny?

37:18.200 --> 37:19.714
Who did this?

37:19.920 --> 37:23.220
I didn't say anything.

37:23.240 --> 37:25.471
Try again, Snarly.

37:26.160 --> 37:29.915
Well you see, you were
about to tear the runt apart,

37:30.080 --> 37:34.074
when this old beam just fell
and hit you! It was crazy!

37:36.360 --> 37:41.620
Oh tragic. Right well that's it,

37:41.640 --> 37:43.791
have a good evening.

37:46.560 --> 37:49.029
So you couldn't race?

37:50.440 --> 37:53.080
I don't see any further use for you.

37:54.040 --> 37:55.110
Stop!

37:58.040 --> 38:02.193
Now, where were we, Basil?

38:03.000 --> 38:09.236
The beam fell on me and
you helped me off to bed?

38:10.440 --> 38:13.114
The beam did this?

38:13.800 --> 38:14.916
Oh dear.

38:18.040 --> 38:21.397
I just wanted to help Fitz. He
was going to lose all his money.

38:21.840 --> 38:24.912
So? That might have been just
the lesson he needed to learn.

38:25.080 --> 38:28.420
Money is a human
matter, it's complicated.

38:28.440 --> 38:32.320
Everyone makes mistakes. The
thing is to learn from them.

38:33.000 --> 38:34.354
Here he comes!

38:35.320 --> 38:36.700
What's going on?

38:36.720 --> 38:39.189
What's going on? We're going
to hunt for the leopard!

38:40.160 --> 38:42.980
We? Ha, this I gotta see.

38:43.000 --> 38:45.993
Ow, my hip, oww, when did that happen?

38:47.480 --> 38:49.039
Lead on, Pezulu

38:56.440 --> 38:57.590
Oh, look at this place.

39:00.160 --> 39:01.310
Gross.

39:02.960 --> 39:04.460
Birds.
- Oh lucky dog,

39:04.480 --> 39:05.550
someone up there likes you.

39:06.360 --> 39:08.272
It's the voice of the ancestors,

39:08.440 --> 39:10.671
a sign of change to come.

39:15.080 --> 39:18.676
The little girl was bathing here.
It's the leopard's waterhole.

39:18.840 --> 39:20.354
I hope he doesn't like chicken.

39:26.000 --> 39:28.231
He could be watching us right now

39:29.040 --> 39:31.555
Jock! Come boy. We're going in.

39:31.760 --> 39:34.060
The leopard is out hunting.

39:34.080 --> 39:35.594
Let's come back tomorrow.

39:36.280 --> 39:38.795
We wait in the cave till he returns.

39:39.240 --> 39:43.792
Really? In there? I don't know
if this is such a good idea.

39:46.640 --> 39:48.199
Psst, Pezulu!
- Look at this!

39:48.400 --> 39:49.914
Ohh, careful, careful!

39:53.600 --> 39:56.877
Haibo wena! You'll kill
us before the leopard!

40:00.200 --> 40:01.156
Baba?

40:01.800 --> 40:04.679
No. These are thousands of years old.

40:05.280 --> 40:08.193
So no new ones?

40:09.520 --> 40:10.476
Jock!

40:26.120 --> 40:27.349
Stay close boy.

40:27.720 --> 40:28.471
Okay.

40:33.040 --> 40:35.475
He won't come back. He knows we're here.

40:37.200 --> 40:38.270
What was that?

40:38.440 --> 40:39.715
We should stay!

40:42.360 --> 40:43.430
Wow!

40:45.120 --> 40:46.349
Wait here.

40:47.520 --> 40:48.636
Mo-om!

41:28.680 --> 41:29.511
Jock!

41:34.120 --> 41:35.190
Leave her alone!

41:48.160 --> 41:50.516
Stay there, mom!

41:54.560 --> 41:55.630
Don't! Don't shoot!

42:22.360 --> 42:23.237
Mom?

42:26.200 --> 42:29.540
Jess? Oh no. Jess!

42:29.560 --> 42:30.789
He's gone.

42:37.000 --> 42:38.195
I'm here.

42:43.200 --> 42:46.432
It's always said that dogs don't
"feel" things, not the way humans do.

42:46.600 --> 42:50.480
Anyone who had seen Jock's sad eyes

42:50.640 --> 42:54.873
would never say that.
His heart was broken.

43:03.800 --> 43:09.159
Poor Jess. Oh Jock, I'm so sorry.

44:19.080 --> 44:24.712
I'm so proud of you.

44:26.160 --> 44:28.117
It's all my fault.

44:29.600 --> 44:31.592
No, you...

44:34.760 --> 44:38.071
you did everything you could.

44:38.240 --> 44:39.913
You bear no blame.

44:44.040 --> 44:47.556
Don't die. I need you.

44:48.440 --> 44:53.879
You'll do fine. You're like your father.

44:56.960 --> 45:01.910
Fighting for what you believe in.

45:04.120 --> 45:08.717
I love you, I'll always be with you.

46:16.360 --> 46:20.700
We travelled for months and
finally we were here, Pilgrims Rest.

46:20.720 --> 46:22.871
The town I had dreamed of.

46:25.120 --> 46:27.191
It had been 10 years since
the big strikes were made here,

46:27.360 --> 46:29.033
but I was sure there was still
gold coming out of those hills,

46:29.240 --> 46:31.232
and I aimed to find it.

46:31.440 --> 46:32.317
Here we are.

46:33.120 --> 46:34.713
See you at the wagon park, Jim!

46:35.400 --> 46:38.120
I'll bring back pots of
gold boy! See you later.

46:38.960 --> 46:40.940
Jock. You OK, son?

46:40.960 --> 46:44.397
Sure, I'm just going
to keep an eye on Fitz.

46:45.280 --> 46:47.670
Basopha! Basopha! Watch out!

46:50.200 --> 46:51.156
Hello there!

46:54.520 --> 46:57.354
I was blinded by my enthusiasm,

46:57.520 --> 47:01.116
I didn't see how bleak things were,
I didn't see that it was too late.

47:01.400 --> 47:07.874
Every piece of ground in the valley had
been claimed. Newcomers were not welcome.

47:19.000 --> 47:19.877
Hey!

47:23.520 --> 47:25.477
What are you doing?

47:25.640 --> 47:26.630
I'm sorry.

47:26.800 --> 47:29.156
All the claims are taken. Move off.

47:38.240 --> 47:40.038
Years of dreaming, months of journeying,

47:40.200 --> 47:44.558
my life's savings...
gone. I had nothing.

47:45.320 --> 47:46.879
And I didn't know what to do.

47:47.440 --> 47:50.831
I think we're too late Jock.
All this way for nothing.

47:51.480 --> 47:55.190
This is all I've got left. And
I've only got this because of you.

47:55.920 --> 47:58.037
No. Not now.

47:59.080 --> 48:04.678
Hey, come on! No! No!
Not now! Jock, stop it!

48:04.880 --> 48:09.033
Stop it! Hey! Come on!

48:09.320 --> 48:10.834
Mr. Fitzpatrick?

48:11.920 --> 48:15.834
How nice to see you!

48:16.240 --> 48:19.438
Well? Looks like you're
enjoying yourself.

48:19.600 --> 48:21.796
Any luck, Mr. Fitzpatrick?
- No.

48:22.000 --> 48:24.140
Hard work, that's the ticket, my boy!

48:24.160 --> 48:27.312
Oh we're not afraid of that,
Sir. It seems we are a bit late,

48:27.480 --> 48:30.393
all the claims were taken. They
say Barberton is where the gold is!

48:30.840 --> 48:32.718
I wish you luck.

48:35.560 --> 48:37.460
Why don't you join us for tea?

48:37.480 --> 48:38.550
Lillian!

48:39.440 --> 48:43.020
Morning, morning. Oh George!

48:43.040 --> 48:49.594
I preach the good news! Our
little dog has killed a leopard!

48:51.080 --> 48:54.278
He's a local hero!

48:54.760 --> 48:57.753
Well even you're afraid
of leopards, George...

49:01.040 --> 49:04.829
Oh I am going to setup some fight!

49:05.080 --> 49:07.151
Happy days are here again,

49:07.320 --> 49:09.710
Leopard must have choked on him.

49:17.160 --> 49:18.150
Food.

49:20.960 --> 49:25.637
Jess died. Jock's an
inspiration to me though.

49:25.800 --> 49:29.714
He's so clever and afraid of
nothing. He's taught me so much.

49:29.880 --> 49:31.872
I couldn't have asked for a better dog.

49:33.520 --> 49:34.874
Stay inside, Polly.

49:35.080 --> 49:36.514
Let her go, father

49:54.960 --> 49:55.996
Hey Polly.

49:56.600 --> 49:59.718
Hello Jock. Are you hungry?

50:00.200 --> 50:05.820
What? No, no I... I, I thought
I saw a cat in the alley.

50:05.840 --> 50:08.260
I must have got a bit clumsy.

50:08.280 --> 50:09.860
Oh...
- Yeah.

50:09.880 --> 50:14.352
Oh why don't you come in? You
couldn't look clumsy if you tried.

50:14.760 --> 50:15.591
Entre.

50:19.000 --> 50:24.155
Jock I heard about your
mother, I'm so sorry.

50:24.320 --> 50:28.917
Thanks. She was so brave.
She died because of me.

50:29.720 --> 50:30.915
Oh, Jock.

50:31.640 --> 50:33.916
I can't get used to her being gone.

50:34.320 --> 50:35.276
Come in.

50:40.120 --> 50:42.157
Healthy appetite, Mr. Fitzpatrick.

50:42.680 --> 50:45.434
Is that the Brittanica? The full set?

50:45.760 --> 50:47.180
Um... Yes.

50:47.200 --> 50:49.351
So tell me, Mr. Fitzpatrick,
what are your plans?

50:49.840 --> 50:53.800
I er..Um, I'm going to look
around for opportunities, sir.

50:53.960 --> 50:55.189
Have you a wagon?

50:55.400 --> 50:56.356
Yes sir.

50:56.520 --> 51:00.355
Good. Start with what you've
got! Lillian has a piano.

51:00.840 --> 51:03.594
Seedling's been saying for
weeks he's going to deliver it.

51:03.760 --> 51:06.832
But, um, if you are up to it?

51:07.600 --> 51:09.193
You can count on me, Sir!

51:11.960 --> 51:14.429
If you get it here in mint condition,

51:14.600 --> 51:16.751
I'll assist you in getting started.

51:17.360 --> 51:19.100
Started with what father?

51:19.120 --> 51:20.873
Transport riding!

51:22.360 --> 51:26.070
Jock! Right! We've got a job to do boy!

51:27.080 --> 51:28.673
No no, Jock. Not yet!

51:28.880 --> 51:33.159
Save those for your
trip, I'll feed the dog.

51:40.400 --> 51:42.631
Oh watch out for the rocks, George.

51:47.040 --> 51:48.076
Oh George.

52:11.600 --> 52:13.080
There's a healing power in Africa,

52:13.320 --> 52:15.073
one that defies wealth.

52:15.280 --> 52:17.078
It's a power that feeds the soul.

52:17.240 --> 52:19.118
And through that power I realised

52:19.320 --> 52:21.835
that I had found a richness
of a different kind.

52:22.000 --> 52:25.550
I had found an incredibly
brave and loyal friend.

52:28.160 --> 52:30.152
Hey, man's here with that dog.

52:33.680 --> 52:37.640
Man's here with that dog. Says
he's coming to fetch the piano.

52:42.040 --> 52:44.700
Oh George I can't stand
these hessian bags,

52:44.720 --> 52:47.474
they drive my allergies
crazy, please, oh George.

52:47.680 --> 52:49.194
Hello me lovelies.

52:56.000 --> 52:59.380
You were doing so well till you

52:59.400 --> 53:02.950
started taking orders
from the wrong guy.

53:04.120 --> 53:07.272
Please, George, I'll
do anything for you,

53:07.480 --> 53:09.278
remember the old days on the stage.

53:09.760 --> 53:14.073
How about a song before you go.

53:14.600 --> 53:16.637
Wind it up, Basil.

53:18.640 --> 53:21.020
On the surface we may seem
an unlikely combination

53:21.040 --> 53:22.520
but I see us

53:25.600 --> 53:28.195
as a team, mutual appreciation

53:28.360 --> 53:30.875
I can see beyond

53:33.360 --> 53:37.660
the rough and ready outer you,

53:37.680 --> 53:41.071
know my words are true, so hang

53:41.240 --> 53:47.237
around and listen for a while, I'm
sure I'll raise a glimmer of a smile.

53:49.600 --> 53:53.060
Well I woke up this morning
had some real bad news,

53:53.080 --> 53:56.551
well I woke up this morning
had some real bad news,

53:56.720 --> 54:02.114
there was darkness all around
me, I had the hessian blues.

54:02.440 --> 54:04.477
Tickle them ivories, Georgie baby

54:04.640 --> 54:10.876
There was darkness all around
me, I so had those hessian blues.

54:12.600 --> 54:16.071
Well I woke up this
morning, all I saw was black,

54:20.080 --> 54:22.640
and the man done told me

54:24.600 --> 54:26.956
You've been sleeping in a sack

54:28.080 --> 54:30.470
and the man done told me that I have

54:31.120 --> 54:33.237
been sleeping in a sack!

54:33.400 --> 54:35.700
Hessian is so 1873,

54:35.720 --> 54:39.430
but I seen the light,
I'm singing what I choose,

54:39.600 --> 54:43.310
yeah I seen the light,
I got nothin' to lose,

54:43.480 --> 54:45.949
I'm as happy as a sad boy,

54:46.120 --> 54:48.351
don't use those hessian blues.

54:48.560 --> 54:50.552
Take it away, Georgie,
tickle those ivories!

54:51.120 --> 54:58.994
I'm as happy as a sad boy,
don't use those hessian blues.

55:03.840 --> 55:06.958
So hang around and listen for a while,

55:07.120 --> 55:10.238
I'm sure I'll raise
a glimmer of a smile.

55:10.400 --> 55:13.393
Basil! Basil!

55:16.280 --> 55:20.274
I'd hate to lose you,

55:20.440 --> 55:23.717
and your good voice. Just remember,

55:25.200 --> 55:28.193
you only take orders from me!

55:32.040 --> 55:34.271
We're here to collect
the piano for Mr. Morris.

55:40.760 --> 55:43.540
I've already loaded the piano.

55:43.560 --> 55:46.075
The letter confirms cancelation of this.

55:47.960 --> 55:51.670
Why don't you and your dog come inside?

55:52.200 --> 55:53.600
I'm afraid we're in a hurry.

55:53.760 --> 55:55.752
Take the piano off!

56:00.200 --> 56:02.795
George! George!

56:03.280 --> 56:06.830
Come on down here now! Get down here.

56:08.080 --> 56:09.992
Gently, gently, put it, yes,

56:10.960 --> 56:12.780
Come on, lift higher.

56:12.800 --> 56:14.280
Careful with that! Easy!

56:21.040 --> 56:24.192
What are you doing up
there? Get back inside!

56:24.680 --> 56:26.876
We have a score to settle.

56:48.240 --> 56:49.594
Go get him, George

56:50.560 --> 56:51.835
Get back here, Jock!

56:52.760 --> 56:54.240
Come boy!

56:57.920 --> 56:59.060
Crikey!

56:59.080 --> 57:03.359
Crack of dawn we leave for

57:04.080 --> 57:07.740
Pilgrims Rest. I'm about
to lose a big client.

57:07.760 --> 57:13.757
You bring the wagon, I'll ride
ahead. And George is coming.

57:21.720 --> 57:24.315
Now careful, careful. We don't
want Polly's piano broken.

57:24.760 --> 57:27.320
There you are, perfect order.
- Oh ho wonderful!

57:28.400 --> 57:30.790
Well let's see if it's still in tune.

57:34.200 --> 57:35.998
Ah! Good heavens!
- Ah! Hey hey, Basil!

57:36.760 --> 57:38.060
What else is in there?

57:38.080 --> 57:41.460
My apologies Sir! It's the
monkey from Crooks Corner.

57:41.480 --> 57:43.233
Oh poor little lamb.

57:43.920 --> 57:46.196
Calm down, Basil, what's wrong?

57:46.880 --> 57:49.395
George was about to feed
me to the crocodiles.

57:49.840 --> 57:52.300
Because of me?
- Yes. I wish I'd never met you.

57:52.320 --> 57:54.676
Sorry. I didn't want
you to get into trouble.

57:54.840 --> 57:56.718
What have you done to him?
- Nothing!

57:56.880 --> 57:59.156
Come inside, Basil. Come on, this way.

58:14.480 --> 58:17.837
I say Lillian! Are we
keeping this monkey?

58:18.760 --> 58:20.592
Give him a banana, father!

58:21.800 --> 58:23.951
Is it good?

58:28.160 --> 58:29.276
Who could that be?

58:31.200 --> 58:33.999
What in God's name are you doing here?

58:34.560 --> 58:39.351
I..er.. I need to talk to you, Sir.

58:39.520 --> 58:40.740
It's Seedling!

58:40.760 --> 58:42.300
What's the flower for?

58:42.320 --> 58:43.800
Well sorry to trouble you, luv.

58:47.640 --> 58:50.235
Oh please, here a... accept my flower?

58:50.760 --> 58:52.479
Um... Come in.

58:53.440 --> 58:55.980
I get you some tea.

58:56.000 --> 58:57.116
Argh. Time for a walk.

58:58.960 --> 59:04.957
Sir, sir, I need a moment
please. Well the piano...

59:06.240 --> 59:09.500
You see I thought I did
all of your deliveries?

59:09.520 --> 59:12.831
I'm giving this young fellow
a chance to prove himself.

59:15.080 --> 59:16.639
Wo, hey, take it easy.

59:20.880 --> 59:24.580
Ah, where's that brave dog of yours?

59:24.600 --> 59:26.717
Jock, Jock, come back.

59:26.880 --> 59:29.839
Ah, there you are.

59:30.600 --> 59:34.020
Come on take it. Take it.

59:34.040 --> 59:35.394
He'll only accept food from me.

59:36.200 --> 59:39.318
Ah... Well trained.

59:39.880 --> 59:42.700
Anyway it's wonderful to see you folk...

59:42.720 --> 59:46.953
I have a proposition for you.

59:47.120 --> 59:48.260
For who?

59:48.280 --> 59:53.514
Oh Mr. Fitzpatrick. Your dog
has become the talk of the town.

59:54.160 --> 59:57.340
I'd like to give him another
chance of proving himself.

59:57.360 --> 01:00:01.559
Jock has nothing to prove, he won't
participate in any more of your races.

01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:04.753
It's not the races, Mr. Fitzpatrick.

01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:07.159
It's a challenge.

01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:11.071
I mean your dog is itching for a fight.

01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:14.554
Now ask yourself why he raced.

01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:20.270
I meanm why he challenged
George? Bold as brass.

01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:21.357
No

01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:23.660
Well he's fedup with
being the runt, that's why.

01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:27.469
He wants recognition.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.820
And it seems you want it too.
- Well no!

01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:34.799
Oh, yeah, the whole
town's heard your stories.

01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:37.795
He killed the man eating leopard!

01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:42.060
Well looks like you've set
the challenge, Mr. Fitzpatrick.

01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:44.940
Me? I did nothing of the sort!

01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:49.955
Well if the challenge
is too big, maybe the

01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:55.952
dog's too small and your
stories are too tall?

01:00:56.360 --> 01:00:57.953
I think it's time you left.

01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:01.111
Which is it, Mr. Fitzpatrick?

01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:20.200
Will you stop that!?

01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:27.796
Oh dear, that's a bad sign.

01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:31.075
Relax, Basil.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.310
Tell me again why we're
walking through the graveyard?

01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:41.078
Is this your idea of how to calm
me down? Because it's not working!

01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:44.900
You'll be safer out
here with Jim and Pezulu.

01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:46.752
You're not gonna fight, are you?

01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:49.389
Of course not, that
wouldn't solve anything.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:53.540
Good. Because George is crazy.
He wasn't always that way,

01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:55.180
but Seedling tied him up, beat him,

01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:57.460
made him fight, it drove him mad!

01:01:57.480 --> 01:01:59.597
Well there you are, lover boy!

01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:02.110
How is she?

01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:04.900
She's fine. -
Fine? - Yeah.

01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:08.180
I don't wanna know about
fine, I want details! Details!

01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:11.900
You know, what was she wearing?
Was she wearing perfume?

01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:13.639
Was she wearing a collar?

01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:18.033
Did she look at ya? Was she speaking
French? You know a little vous le vous?

01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:20.520
What was that?

01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:28.400
I hear that too.

01:02:36.280 --> 01:02:37.180
Jim!

01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:37.872
George?

01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:41.712
Good evening, Basil.

01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:50.540
Still taking orders from the wrong guy?

01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:51.471
Which guy?

01:02:56.760 --> 01:02:57.830
Let him go!

01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:00.900
Run, Basil!

01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:02.195
Oh no! Bad thing!

01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:05.075
Stop it!
- I should finish you off!

01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:07.470
Hey!

01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:11.260
Oooh. What are you going
to do with that, Basil?

01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:12.760
Leave him alone!!

01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:17.319
Leave him alone! Stop
fooling around, George!

01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:21.272
Time for your challenge,

01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:24.780
Come on.

01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:27.360
In you go. Come on! Go on, in!

01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:29.796
Ah, get in there dog. Go on. Move, move!

01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:32.758
Good dog.

01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:46.714
Oh no!

01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:50.317
Jim?

01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:53.192
They've taken Jock.

01:03:55.280 --> 01:03:59.832
Who could that be?

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:01.940
It's very late. At this hour, hmm?

01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:03.394
Sorry to trouble you.
- What is it?

01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:06.359
Seedling's taken Jock.
They've burnt my wagon.

01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:08.359
Father, get the cart.

01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:11.520
Don't worry, Polly. We'll find him.

01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:20.078
People! People! This is the final
call, we gotta have an early start.

01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:25.110
Are there any more bets out
there for the leopard slayer?

01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:38.231
Haven't been much help
to your Fitzy, have you?

01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:43.433
All you had to do was
stay out of our business.

01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:48.359
Bad dog! Don't let me down tomorrow,

01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:51.397
I want a good fight.

01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:54.872
You stay with me.

01:04:56.120 --> 01:04:58.351
Aah! Hey I can walk you know!

01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:02.029
What is this? Buddy up?

01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:04.429
Get away from here!

01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:05.954
I've caused enough trouble.

01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:13.154
Julian! Get away! Quick!

01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:27.392
Time for business George.

01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:38.951
Yes. What a beautiful day!

01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:45.750
George!

01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:49.037
Hup hup, come on!

01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:50.431
Hiyah!

01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:56.100
Where is he?

01:05:56.120 --> 01:05:57.260
Who?

01:05:57.280 --> 01:05:58.999
The little coward has run away!

01:06:00.640 --> 01:06:02.154
He won't miss the fight.

01:06:02.560 --> 01:06:04.472
You better hope not.

01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:18.751
I need a curtain raiser. Your dog.

01:06:18.920 --> 01:06:23.756
Seedling please! He stands no chance.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.560
Find our challenger, and your dog lives.

01:06:27.560 --> 01:06:29.392
Wind it up, Basil.

01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:44.560
People people! Please please
please! May I have your attention.

01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:49.514
If you'll be patient, we'll
have a little entertainment

01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:51.460
before the main event.

01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:54.120
George may be a little rusty,

01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:57.597
it's been a while
since his last fight...

01:06:58.840 --> 01:07:01.260
Treat this as a warm up!

01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:03.272
That's not a warm up, that's Snarly!

01:07:21.680 --> 01:07:23.433
Basil loved these.

01:07:24.320 --> 01:07:25.310
No thanks.

01:07:25.880 --> 01:07:29.191
Seedling's making Snarly fight
George. He's got no chance.

01:07:29.760 --> 01:07:30.716
Baba?

01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:39.100
You are free, now it is time to choose.

01:07:39.120 --> 01:07:42.340
How can I? Everything
I've done has gone wrong.

01:07:42.360 --> 01:07:44.900
I lost my mother, made
everyone here suffer.

01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:48.072
Fitz lost everything because
of me. And now Snarly...

01:07:48.840 --> 01:07:52.540
Mistakes are the price
we pay for knowledge.

01:07:52.560 --> 01:07:54.180
I can not beat him, Baba.

01:07:54.200 --> 01:07:57.557
It is time. Your mother is with you.

01:08:02.880 --> 01:08:07.511
Well here he is, folks,
all the way from Australia,

01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:11.158
Snapping Snarly!

01:08:12.240 --> 01:08:13.720
Where is the leopard slayer?

01:08:14.440 --> 01:08:17.558
Jock! Come on, where are ya!

01:08:20.600 --> 01:08:21.511
Jock!

01:08:42.840 --> 01:08:47.392
With teeth larger than
a lions, weighing in

01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:52.993
at 9 stone, our one, our only George!

01:08:53.600 --> 01:08:55.956
Let's hear it, folks, come on!

01:09:17.439 --> 01:09:18.590
Jock!

01:09:20.479 --> 01:09:22.198
The Leopard Slayer!

01:09:22.840 --> 01:09:25.594
All right, folks, this is it, come on!

01:09:39.640 --> 01:09:41.438
I love a fight in the morning.

01:09:42.439 --> 01:09:47.469
Hey! Runt! I have a
little surprise for you.

01:09:50.760 --> 01:09:52.831
Recognize this?

01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:56.590
I think it killed your mother?

01:09:57.200 --> 01:09:59.660
Ladies and Gentlemen,

01:09:59.680 --> 01:10:04.960
I present the leopard slayer!

01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:06.998
Go, Jock!

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:12.357
Gimme a fight runt!

01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:14.109
That's it, Jock!

01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:16.749
On me toes, on me toes! Yeah!

01:10:18.760 --> 01:10:23.755
Don't be scared, come
on, I'll make it quick!

01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:37.312
We don't have to do this,
George. We don't have to fight.

01:10:39.800 --> 01:10:40.916
That's it, Jock!

01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:43.474
I'm not your enemy!

01:10:44.360 --> 01:10:46.238
Yes, you are!

01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:50.140
I'm not the one who
chained you up, beat you

01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:51.435
and made you fight!

01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:56.309
Don't let him make a
monkey out of you, Jock!

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:58.434
Who's the monkey?

01:11:00.120 --> 01:11:02.589
You're the one taking
orders from the wrong guy.

01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:07.637
What are you? A weakling??

01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:18.231
You're free. Now it's
your time to choose.

01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:21.916
Get him, George! Come on!

01:11:25.320 --> 01:11:30.236
What are you doing, George?
Come on, you worthless ape!

01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:32.554
It's up to you.

01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:45.757
See ya later, Seedling! Get outta town!

01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:49.591
Get him, George!
- Let's see him off, Basil!

01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:51.396
Come back!

01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:08.833
George, listen!

01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:11.238
Hold on, Basil, I'm coming!

01:12:19.720 --> 01:12:22.280
We made it, George.

01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:25.390
George?

01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:28.952
George, come on, my friend.

01:12:31.240 --> 01:12:32.879
Come on my friend, ah!
- Stay there, Basil!

01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:34.836
Stay where you are!

01:12:39.240 --> 01:12:41.197
Enjoy your swim.

01:12:43.080 --> 01:12:44.060
Jock!

01:12:44.080 --> 01:12:45.150
Oh boy.

01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:47.712
Help me.
- Oh come on down, Basil.

01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:49.070
Keep coming, keep coming! Basil!

01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:51.880
Don't panic.
- Jock!

01:12:52.040 --> 01:12:53.838
Hold on, Basil!
- Careful, Basil!

01:12:56.760 --> 01:12:57.637
Jock!

01:12:58.120 --> 01:12:59.713
Hold on! I'll help you!
- Help, help!

01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:01.519
Jock! Be careful! Jock!

01:13:03.240 --> 01:13:04.276
I'll get ya. Hold on!

01:13:05.200 --> 01:13:06.077
Ok there, shoot!

01:13:07.760 --> 01:13:08.557
Again!

01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:11.716
Swim Jock! Swim!

01:13:11.880 --> 01:13:13.030
Hold on, Basil!

01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:19.220
I'm holding on, I'm holding
on. Ah! Is that necessary?

01:13:19.240 --> 01:13:21.311
Yes! Jock is our hero!

01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:29.220
There goes George. I
hope he'll be alright.

01:13:29.240 --> 01:13:31.357
At least he's free
to decide for himself.

01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:33.910
We all can, thanks to you, Jock.

01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:37.833
Come on, your fans are
waiting, take a bow.

01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:41.874
...Did you see him? He was
amazing, did you see him?

01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:47.020
Oh, mon dieu, quel courage, quel
courage!
C' es tun chien axtraordinaire!

01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:49.953
Can't believe it. Can't believe it.

01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:02.740
Make way, make way! Here comes the hero.

01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:04.420
Get outta the way here,
watch your feet there!

01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:07.114
Well done, Jock! Good dog.

01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:11.833
Well done, Jock. Well done,
boy! We're so proud of you!

01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:18.470
Oh! Jock!

01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:22.279
Go and see him, Polly!

01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:25.718
Hamba Kahle.

01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:43.500
Bravo, Jock. Se ete extraordinnaire.

01:14:43.520 --> 01:14:44.476
Thanks

01:14:47.960 --> 01:14:51.397
Ahhh, that's nice.
That's, that's my boy.

01:14:53.080 --> 01:14:55.515
Hey Polly! Got a sister?

01:14:57.440 --> 01:15:00.274
Look at them, a fine pair.

01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:07.340
I learned a lot over that
journey. I learned that the things

01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:10.080
we want are not necessarily
the things we need.

01:15:10.800 --> 01:15:14.714
And I learned to value friendship,
love, devotion and above all else,

01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:18.995
I learned the importance of courage,

01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:22.830
to stand up for what is right,
and to never, ever give up.

01:15:23.680 --> 01:15:27.380
I was different when it
came to an end. I was a man.

01:15:27.400 --> 01:15:29.710
And I owed it all

01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:32.435
to a brave little dog named Jock.
