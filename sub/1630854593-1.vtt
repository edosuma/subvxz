01:01.480 --> 01:03.480
John.

01:07.880 --> 01:09.880
It's done.

01:12.360 --> 01:14.360
Bye, Dad.

01:40.320 --> 01:42.320
He says it's done.

01:44.440 --> 01:46.240
Why would he lie to us?

01:56.280 --> 01:58.280
Now it's done.

01:59.440 --> 02:00.000
Find your brother.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.440
Find your brother.

02:02.960 --> 02:04.880
Bring him home.

02:44.920 --> 02:47.400
Where are you off to?

02:51.360 --> 02:53.680
Why didn't you just do it?

02:53.720 --> 02:55.680
Would have been easier.

02:57.040 --> 02:58.560
I just couldn't.

03:00.640 --> 03:02.920
I took care of it.

03:06.600 --> 03:08.920
Dad wants you to come home.

03:08.960 --> 03:10.960
He'll let this go.

03:16.480 --> 03:18.400
I'm done.

03:19.720 --> 03:20.000
That's not how this works.
Stop fucking with me, Michael.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.680
That's not how this works.
Stop fucking with me, Michael.

03:22.720 --> 03:24.720
Or what?

03:25.880 --> 03:28.000
Just get out of here.
That's all he wanted.

03:28.000 --> 03:28.960
Just get out of here.
That's all he wanted.

03:34.280 --> 03:36.000
Do you really want to do
that, brother?

03:36.000 --> 03:36.800
Do you really want to do
that, brother?

03:36.840 --> 03:38.800
You were never my brother.

03:38.840 --> 03:42.760
I don't think so.

05:13.640 --> 05:15.680
Just money and papers.

05:15.720 --> 05:19.280
Alright.

07:33.800 --> 07:35.800
Where've you been?

07:37.000 --> 07:38.800
It's almost midnight.

07:38.840 --> 07:41.000
Been sorting a boat out.

07:41.040 --> 07:43.040
Hm.

07:56.680 --> 07:59.360
Mean.

07:59.400 --> 08:00.000
I'm really tired.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.560
I'm really tired.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
I don't care.

08:08.320 --> 08:10.320
Mmm.

08:22.960 --> 08:24.000
Oh God.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.280
Oh God.

08:26.400 --> 08:27.760
Oh my God.

08:27.800 --> 08:29.120
Oh.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.800
Oh.

08:36.760 --> 08:39.480
Oh...
Aaron, stop.

08:39.520 --> 08:40.000
Sorry, sorry. Sorry!

08:40.000 --> 08:41.640
Sorry, sorry. Sorry!

08:41.680 --> 08:44.120
I'm sorry!

08:44.560 --> 08:46.760
Treating me like a stranger
in my own house!

08:46.800 --> 08:48.000
Hey!
What's the matter with you?

08:48.000 --> 08:48.880
Hey!
What's the matter with you?

08:51.480 --> 08:53.560
Caleb. Oh my God.

08:53.600 --> 08:56.000
Get out!
Now look what you made me do!

08:56.000 --> 08:56.240
Get out!
Now look what you made me do!

08:56.280 --> 08:58.400
Get out!
You're being pathetic!

10:28.880 --> 10:30.880
Don't move.

10:33.200 --> 10:35.480
I'll burn that fucking house,
to the ground.

10:39.920 --> 10:40.000
You need stitches.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.920
You need stitches.

10:45.400 --> 10:47.400
I'll be fine.

10:51.160 --> 10:54.480
He can't have got that far.
He doesn't have money or a passport.

10:54.520 --> 10:56.000
You're supposed to bring
your brother home.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.640
You're supposed to bring
your brother home.

10:57.680 --> 10:59.520
I tried, Dad. I swear.

10:59.560 --> 11:03.800
Everything you and your brother
have in your heads,

11:03.840 --> 11:04.000
I planted there

11:04.000 --> 11:05.520
I planted there

11:05.560 --> 11:08.200
So don't try
and fucking bullshit me.

11:15.600 --> 11:17.400
He lied to us.

11:17.440 --> 11:19.200
Why do you want him back?

11:19.240 --> 11:20.000
Children make mistakes.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.200
Children make mistakes.

11:22.240 --> 11:24.520
Their parents forgive them.

11:24.560 --> 11:25.880
That's how it works.

11:27.440 --> 11:28.000
Would you do the same for me?

11:28.000 --> 11:29.920
Would you do the same for me?

11:31.560 --> 11:32.760
I just did.

11:35.080 --> 11:36.000
Get your eye seen to.

11:36.000 --> 11:36.760
Get your eye seen to.

11:50.840 --> 11:52.000
Excuse me.

11:52.000 --> 11:52.760
Excuse me.

11:54.200 --> 11:56.200
I'm sorry.

12:03.840 --> 12:05.600
What are you doing here?

12:06.600 --> 12:08.000
This is the property of
my grandfather.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.200
This is the property of
my grandfather.

12:10.160 --> 12:12.200
He's very strict.

12:15.160 --> 12:16.000
Do you know where I can
get a room?

12:16.000 --> 12:19.280
Do you know where I can
get a room?

12:19.320 --> 12:21.640
A place where I could
stay for a little while?

12:21.680 --> 12:23.840
Are you a law enforcement officer?

12:25.600 --> 12:27.440
I'm just a guy looking for a room.

12:32.480 --> 12:34.520
Mum!
Hmm?

12:34.920 --> 12:38.160
There's a stranger who needs
an accommodation.

12:41.760 --> 12:43.920
We don't have any hotels here.

12:43.960 --> 12:46.520
You have to try somewhere else.

12:46.560 --> 12:48.000
Just a bed is fine.

12:48.000 --> 12:48.200
Just a bed is fine.

12:48.240 --> 12:50.000
How long you staying?

12:50.520 --> 12:52.520
Few days.
Why?

12:53.640 --> 12:54.880
Hunting trip.

12:57.800 --> 12:59.160
Travelling a little light.

12:59.200 --> 13:02.160
Yeah... I left my gear on the train.

13:02.200 --> 13:03.760
They're sending it to me.

13:03.800 --> 13:04.000
You're going to need
more than a few days then.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.840
You're going to need
more than a few days then.

13:06.640 --> 13:08.640
If you want to get any hunting in.

13:10.080 --> 13:12.000
Folks don't like smoking much
round here, either.

13:12.000 --> 13:12.320
Folks don't like smoking much
round here, either.

13:12.680 --> 13:14.680
I'm sorry.

13:19.680 --> 13:20.000
There may be something. Um..

13:20.000 --> 13:21.640
There may be something. Um..

13:21.680 --> 13:23.760
There are hunting cabins
on the mountain.

13:23.800 --> 13:26.360
You can stay for a few days.
It will get cold soon, though.

13:26.400 --> 13:28.000
That's perfect.
Head up the road here. Um...

13:28.000 --> 13:29.200
That's perfect.
Head up the road here. Um...

13:29.240 --> 13:32.200
It's OK, Mum - I'll be happy to
accompany the gentlemen.

13:32.240 --> 13:33.680
You're not going, Caleb.

13:33.720 --> 13:36.000
Um... Keep going round there
and you'll see.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.960
Um... Keep going round there
and you'll see.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.800
You'll see it there.

13:39.840 --> 13:41.920
Alright. Thank you.

13:42.800 --> 13:44.000
Thank you, Caleb.

13:44.000 --> 13:44.920
Thank you, Caleb.

13:47.640 --> 13:49.280
That way.
That way, yeah.

13:52.120 --> 13:53.960
Why can't he stay at our place?

13:54.000 --> 13:55.760
Well, you know why.

13:57.760 --> 13:59.240
Ooh!

13:59.280 --> 14:00.000
He has a gun.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
He has a gun.

14:02.280 --> 14:03.720
So?

14:05.000 --> 14:07.360
I thought...We, don't need
a man with a gun.

14:08.360 --> 14:10.160
OK?

15:13.680 --> 15:17.840
Seems like an incredibly long way
to travel just for some hunting.

15:19.880 --> 15:20.000
Not a lot of hunting where I live.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.120
Not a lot of hunting where I live.

15:22.160 --> 15:24.520
I don't if you told me
where that is.

15:24.760 --> 15:26.760
I didn't.

15:28.120 --> 15:29.760
You don't talk very much.

15:29.800 --> 15:32.400
You do.

15:32.440 --> 15:34.920
That's really a shame,
because I don't often find

15:34.960 --> 15:36.000
people to exchange opinions with
around here.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.280
people to exchange opinions with
around here.

15:37.800 --> 15:39.840
Not that I really know much
about the world.

15:39.880 --> 15:41.440
Just thought it'd be interesting.

15:41.480 --> 15:44.000
Making comparisons with an outsider.

15:44.000 --> 15:44.080
Making comparisons with an outsider.

15:45.920 --> 15:47.880
I can make it from here. Thanks.

15:49.160 --> 15:51.400
But I need to explain
a few things first.

16:07.240 --> 16:08.000
Hardly anyone ever uses this one.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.800
Hardly anyone ever uses this one.

16:11.120 --> 16:12.800
Especially not this time of year.

16:15.480 --> 16:16.000
Not... very suitable for hunting.

16:16.000 --> 16:19.080
Not... very suitable for hunting.

16:25.560 --> 16:27.360
Is everything to your liking?

16:28.520 --> 16:31.080
Yeah, it's fine.

16:33.200 --> 16:34.680
Hey, that's alright.

16:35.880 --> 16:37.960
I'd like to get some sleep.

16:40.160 --> 16:43.600
How do you intend to...
nourish and hydrate yourself?

16:43.640 --> 16:45.120
I'll come down to the village.
Well...

16:45.160 --> 16:48.000
there are two different shops.
You can make a wrong decision.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.080
there are two different shops.
You can make a wrong decision.

16:49.120 --> 16:50.840
Only one is correct.
Hnn.

16:50.880 --> 16:53.960
If you step foot in the other,
you'll end up straight in hell.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.360
Alright.

16:55.440 --> 16:56.000
Got a car nearby?

16:56.000 --> 16:58.440
Got a car nearby?

16:58.480 --> 16:59.920
Yeah.

16:59.960 --> 17:02.840
I'll wrap this up then.
I can carry it fine.

17:02.880 --> 17:04.000
It's not you.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.640
It's not you.

17:05.680 --> 17:07.520
It's the people who live here.

17:07.560 --> 17:09.880
Not too happy seeing strangers
walking around with booze.

17:09.920 --> 17:12.000
Not too happy with booze
at all, actually.

17:12.000 --> 17:12.440
Not too happy with booze
at all, actually.

17:12.480 --> 17:15.080
Or strangers.

17:15.120 --> 17:19.400
They're fanatics. One ounce of fun
you go straight to the bad place.

17:19.440 --> 17:20.000
Which makes me wonder what
you were doing here.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.920
Which makes me wonder what
you were doing here.

17:21.960 --> 17:23.800
Hunting.

17:26.480 --> 17:28.000
Here for the conquest?

17:28.000 --> 17:28.320
Here for the conquest?

17:35.360 --> 17:36.000
Um...

17:36.000 --> 17:37.080
Um...

17:38.360 --> 17:40.360
How does the mail come in?

17:40.400 --> 17:42.840
There's a house at
the end of the wharf.

17:42.880 --> 17:44.000
Are you expecting something?

17:44.000 --> 17:44.680
Are you expecting something?

17:44.720 --> 17:46.000
Yeah.

17:46.040 --> 17:47.880
See ya.
See ya.

18:02.600 --> 18:04.040
Take a seat.

18:24.200 --> 18:26.560
Do you have children?

18:29.720 --> 18:32.000
I would never hurt a child.

18:32.000 --> 18:32.880
I would never hurt a child.

18:32.920 --> 18:34.800
Ever.

18:36.560 --> 18:38.640
But if you have children...

18:41.080 --> 18:43.960
..then I'm sure you can imagine
the lengths a father would go

18:44.000 --> 18:45.400
to find his own.

18:46.840 --> 18:48.000
Look at me when I'm
talking to you, please.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.800
Look at me when I'm
talking to you, please.

18:56.240 --> 18:58.560
Imagine you're own child
disappear...

19:01.040 --> 19:04.000
..and there's a man
who knows where he is.

19:04.000 --> 19:04.640
..and there's a man
who knows where he is.

19:04.680 --> 19:06.840
But he won't tell you.

19:06.880 --> 19:10.800
A man who's helping him.

19:10.840 --> 19:12.000
So you might never see
your child again.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.040
So you might never see
your child again.

19:14.080 --> 19:16.800
What would you be willing to do

19:16.840 --> 19:20.000
to find out what that man knows?

19:20.000 --> 19:20.160
to find out what that man knows?

19:24.040 --> 19:26.440
Now imagine...

19:26.760 --> 19:28.000
..what I would do.

19:28.000 --> 19:28.600
..what I would do.

19:47.440 --> 19:50.480
Ah!

19:50.520 --> 19:52.000
Aah!

19:52.000 --> 19:52.360
Aah!

20:32.400 --> 20:34.240
John.

20:34.280 --> 20:37.280
John, Dad's stuck at the dam.
I have to go and get him.

20:37.320 --> 20:38.800
Can I come?

20:39.160 --> 20:40.000
I'll be quick.

20:40.000 --> 20:40.760
I'll be quick.

21:50.840 --> 21:52.000
Father.

21:52.000 --> 21:52.800
Father.

22:05.120 --> 22:07.680
They found it a few miles
from the cave.

22:40.160 --> 22:42.120
I'm sorry that, Lea.

22:46.280 --> 22:48.000
Lord had plenty of reasons
to call him back.

22:48.000 --> 22:48.960
Lord had plenty of reasons
to call him back.

22:50.080 --> 22:52.160
He'll have plenty of
explaining to do.

22:58.400 --> 23:00.600
We should pray for his soul.

23:01.600 --> 23:03.560
Lord, grant him mercy.

23:05.920 --> 23:08.440
And I'll attend to you
and Caleb, hmm?

23:21.920 --> 23:25.200
Lord, forgive Aaron...

23:26.760 --> 23:28.000
..for the sins he committed
on this Earth.

23:28.000 --> 23:29.160
..for the sins he committed
on this Earth.

23:31.960 --> 23:35.240
..for he did not always see
the pain he caused.

23:49.480 --> 23:51.680
Fuck is this place?

24:31.840 --> 24:32.000
Death.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.760
Death.

24:33.800 --> 24:38.280
Sometimes its embrace is
slow and natural.

24:38.320 --> 24:40.000
Sometimes we may even
look upon it as a liberation.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.160
Sometimes we may even
look upon it as a liberation.

24:43.920 --> 24:45.560
And other times...

24:53.040 --> 24:54.960
Other times...

24:55.000 --> 24:56.000
..it arrives suddenly,
without warning.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.280
..it arrives suddenly,
without warning.

24:58.720 --> 25:01.160
But it's never unexpected.

25:01.200 --> 25:03.800
The cold, the ice.

25:04.280 --> 25:06.400
They're our fickle custodians,

25:06.440 --> 25:11.600
and we know that our time here
can be cut short at any moment.

25:13.200 --> 25:17.560
The Lord holds us
in the palm of His hand,

25:18.640 --> 25:20.000
and we bow to His glory.

25:20.000 --> 25:20.920
and we bow to His glory.

25:22.200 --> 25:24.480
And we must reassure

25:24.520 --> 25:27.840
Caleb and Lea that,
though they have lost

25:27.880 --> 25:28.000
a father and a husband,
they are not alone.

25:28.000 --> 25:31.440
a father and a husband,
they are not alone.

25:32.560 --> 25:34.840
And we will protect you

25:34.880 --> 25:36.000
as long as you are with us.

25:36.000 --> 25:36.920
as long as you are with us.

25:37.360 --> 25:39.320
For you're in the womb of nature,

25:40.240 --> 25:42.000
created by our Lord.

25:52.800 --> 25:55.520
Hey.
Hello.

26:06.040 --> 26:07.920
Losing a twin...

26:11.760 --> 26:13.520
..It's unbearably painful.

26:18.720 --> 26:21.440
Something you could never
understand.

26:24.680 --> 26:28.160
Just like I could never understand
the pain of losing a husband.

26:34.720 --> 26:36.840
I know you don't feel sorrow.

26:39.600 --> 26:40.000
I know you don't.

26:40.000 --> 26:41.600
I know you don't.

26:44.320 --> 26:46.160
I can't blame you for that.

27:04.360 --> 27:08.160
They throw your hat
and a picture into a hole.

27:08.960 --> 27:10.560
It isn't a real funeral.

27:17.280 --> 27:19.120
What happened to him?

27:22.160 --> 27:25.360
He went out at sea...

27:26.520 --> 27:28.000
..and never came back.

27:28.000 --> 27:28.760
..and never came back.

27:28.800 --> 27:30.800
Hmm.

28:04.920 --> 28:06.360
Wait here.

28:17.720 --> 28:19.920
What did this one do?

28:20.480 --> 28:22.720
He's just lost his parents.

28:22.760 --> 28:24.000
Some... immigrants.

28:24.000 --> 28:24.800
Some... immigrants.

28:29.440 --> 28:31.880
Hi...
Don't say a word.

28:33.720 --> 28:35.720
Move.

28:39.160 --> 28:40.000
Sorry about that.

28:40.000 --> 28:40.960
Sorry about that.

29:06.040 --> 29:07.920
Good morning.
Morning.

29:13.200 --> 29:14.760
How can I help?

29:14.800 --> 29:16.720
I'm expecting a package.
Ah yeah.

29:18.080 --> 29:20.000
Name?
Miller.

29:20.000 --> 29:20.440
Name?
Miller.

29:22.040 --> 29:24.240
No, nothing.

29:24.280 --> 29:26.240
Are you sure?
You're welcome to check

29:26.280 --> 29:28.000
if you don't believe me. Why would
I lie to a man I don't know?

29:28.000 --> 29:29.120
if you don't believe me. Why would
I lie to a man I don't know?

29:30.080 --> 29:32.000
OK. Thank you.
You...

29:32.040 --> 29:33.920
You were at the funeral earlier.

29:36.600 --> 29:39.800
Yeah.
Who told you the mail comes here?

29:41.200 --> 29:43.280
That girl.
Oh!

29:43.320 --> 29:44.000
I know.

29:44.000 --> 29:45.320
I know.

29:48.520 --> 29:51.560
No doubt a brave woman, but, uh...

29:51.920 --> 29:52.000
She embodies the charm of sin.
Yeah.

29:52.000 --> 29:54.480
She embodies the charm of sin.
Yeah.

29:55.000 --> 29:57.360
Like the man who died.

29:57.400 --> 30:00.000
He was a sinner.
Got what he deserved.

30:00.000 --> 30:00.840
He was a sinner.
Got what he deserved.

30:23.160 --> 30:24.000
No, I haven't seen anyone.

30:24.000 --> 30:25.040
No, I haven't seen anyone.

30:26.000 --> 30:27.440
Why?

30:27.480 --> 30:29.360
Can I help you with something?

30:30.160 --> 30:32.000
This gentleman was just asking if
we'd seen a stranger

30:32.000 --> 30:33.640
This gentleman was just asking if
we'd seen a stranger

30:33.680 --> 30:35.560
in the past couple of days.

30:35.600 --> 30:37.320
I told him we hadn't.

30:40.960 --> 30:43.520
There's a man who might
be hiding out around here.

30:43.560 --> 30:45.600
He's dangerous,
and most likely armed.

30:46.320 --> 30:48.000
It's important we find him quickly.

30:48.000 --> 30:48.160
It's important we find him quickly.

30:48.200 --> 30:49.760
My son hasn't seen him.

30:50.160 --> 30:52.760
I have. He was
looking for somewhere to stay.

30:58.440 --> 31:00.640
Who are you, really?
Why are you here?

31:03.560 --> 31:04.000
Why are you asking?

31:04.000 --> 31:05.160
Why are you asking?

31:05.800 --> 31:08.000
Cos the police came looking for you.

31:14.720 --> 31:17.000
I told them you left.

31:23.560 --> 31:25.560
They're not police.

31:27.000 --> 31:28.000
Well, they're gone now.

31:28.000 --> 31:28.280
Well, they're gone now.

31:32.040 --> 31:34.240
Why didn't you tell them the truth?

31:36.520 --> 31:38.480
Caleb thinks you're a good guy.

31:44.040 --> 31:45.960
That's why I did it.

33:01.160 --> 33:03.480
Please!

33:06.680 --> 33:08.680
Ah!

35:31.600 --> 35:33.200
You're no hunter.

35:33.240 --> 35:35.320
What do you plan on catching
with bare hands?

35:36.080 --> 35:37.960
I wasn't hunting. I saw a wolf.

35:38.320 --> 35:40.640
But no one has ever seen a wolf
here.

35:40.680 --> 35:42.360
I just saw two.

35:42.400 --> 35:44.000
What are you doing here?

35:44.000 --> 35:44.200
What are you doing here?

35:44.240 --> 35:46.480
My grandfather would
like to have a word with you.

35:47.240 --> 35:48.600
Hmm.

35:49.760 --> 35:51.040
What's your name?

35:52.480 --> 35:54.280
Ray.

35:55.560 --> 35:57.000
Ray.

35:57.040 --> 35:59.320
I used the conditional
as a form of courtesy.

35:59.360 --> 36:00.000
My grandfather wants
to speak to you.

36:00.000 --> 36:01.680
My grandfather wants
to speak to you.

36:01.720 --> 36:04.440
So, if you don't come to him,
he'll come to you.

36:04.480 --> 36:06.440
Alright.

36:09.040 --> 36:10.960
You have a strange way of talking.

36:12.040 --> 36:15.000
Is it very evident?

36:15.600 --> 36:16.000
My stutter.
No, not talking about your stutter.

36:16.000 --> 36:18.080
My stutter.
No, not talking about your stutter.

36:18.120 --> 36:20.160
You said it. I'm working on it.

36:20.200 --> 36:21.760
I mean the language you use.

36:21.800 --> 36:23.360
You talk like an old man,
for fuck's sake.

36:23.400 --> 36:24.000
This is my way of working on it.

36:24.000 --> 36:25.080
This is my way of working on it.

36:35.280 --> 36:38.480
My grandson seems to have
taken to you.

36:44.240 --> 36:46.760
How long are you planning
to stay, Mr Miller?

36:47.760 --> 36:48.000
I'm leaving soon.
Hmm.

36:48.000 --> 36:50.800
I'm leaving soon.
Hmm.

36:53.040 --> 36:54.800
I don't mean to be impolite.

36:54.840 --> 36:56.000
It's just that we're not used to
outsiders staying very long.

36:56.000 --> 36:59.120
It's just that we're not used to
outsiders staying very long.

36:59.160 --> 37:04.000
They tend to bring customs
that we find, um, unsavoury.

37:04.000 --> 37:04.800
They tend to bring customs
that we find, um, unsavoury.

37:04.840 --> 37:07.040
You know.

37:11.040 --> 37:12.000
You see, God placed us
at the edge of the world.

37:12.000 --> 37:13.520
You see, God placed us
at the edge of the world.

37:15.080 --> 37:17.160
But the world's getting
smaller every day.

37:19.520 --> 37:20.000
Distance is not
the shield that it once was.

37:20.000 --> 37:23.120
Distance is not
the shield that it once was.

37:24.480 --> 37:27.400
Did you hear, a Chinese ship

37:27.440 --> 37:28.000
has navigated
the transpolar sea route.

37:28.000 --> 37:30.120
has navigated
the transpolar sea route.

37:31.000 --> 37:34.640
Hmm. Soon,
everything is going to change.

37:36.200 --> 37:38.480
We have only ourselves to blame.

37:40.120 --> 37:42.680
See, I have to think
about this community.

37:43.160 --> 37:44.000
How to stave off the vanity

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
How to stave off the vanity

37:46.040 --> 37:50.520
that opens the door to...
violence and corruption and drugs,

37:50.560 --> 37:52.000
all the vices that consume
the rest of the world.

37:52.000 --> 37:53.960
all the vices that consume
the rest of the world.

37:54.000 --> 37:57.160
You're free to do whatever
you like, of course.

37:58.160 --> 38:00.000
And I would prefer it if
you did it far away from here.

38:00.000 --> 38:02.080
And I would prefer it if
you did it far away from here.

38:03.520 --> 38:07.520
Doesn't your God forgive everything?
If you truly repent.

38:09.200 --> 38:11.040
But that's hard to do

38:11.080 --> 38:13.240
when you come all the way
to the edge of the world

38:13.280 --> 38:15.520
to run away from your sins.

38:18.440 --> 38:20.280
What makes you think
I'm running away?

38:20.320 --> 38:22.480
Go back to where you came from,
Mr Miller.

38:24.240 --> 38:27.160
Your path to forgiveness
does not start here.

38:31.400 --> 38:32.000
Hold still.

38:32.000 --> 38:33.560
Hold still.

38:40.560 --> 38:42.880
Why are we wasting our time here?

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
We're not leaving until we find him.

38:58.440 --> 39:00.840
Why did you bring him here?

39:00.880 --> 39:02.880
Because he's all alone
in the world.

39:03.880 --> 39:04.000
Is he going to stay with us?

39:04.000 --> 39:05.240
Is he going to stay with us?

39:09.200 --> 39:11.000
You're my son.

39:11.640 --> 39:12.000
Nothing can change that.

39:12.000 --> 39:13.960
Nothing can change that.

39:20.280 --> 39:22.080
Smile, kid.

39:22.600 --> 39:24.680
This is your room now,
this is your home.

39:25.160 --> 39:27.680
Thank you, sir.
Don't call me sir.

39:28.680 --> 39:30.520
Call me Dad.

39:30.560 --> 39:33.720
Hmm?

39:46.080 --> 39:49.600
Hey, Ray!
Hey.

39:49.640 --> 39:52.000
I know you're going.

39:52.680 --> 39:54.200
Oh yeah?

39:55.040 --> 39:57.320
Why are you so determined to
go to hell?

39:59.600 --> 40:00.000
I don't believe in all that.

40:00.000 --> 40:01.200
I don't believe in all that.

40:01.920 --> 40:03.680
And if I'm wrong,

40:03.920 --> 40:06.520
I earned my place
a long time ago.

40:07.720 --> 40:08.000
There are different levels.

40:08.000 --> 40:09.560
There are different levels.

40:09.600 --> 40:11.880
You can at least not make things
any worse for yourself.

40:13.360 --> 40:15.000
Why do you care what happens to me?

40:15.040 --> 40:16.000
Don't people care about each other
where you come from?

40:16.000 --> 40:17.880
Don't people care about each other
where you come from?

40:28.640 --> 40:30.880
Didn't you say we could see whales
from here?

40:31.480 --> 40:32.000
No, it's not the right season.

40:32.000 --> 40:33.440
No, it's not the right season.

40:34.960 --> 40:36.800
I just wanted you to know.

40:38.480 --> 40:40.000
In case you're here when
the season comes.

40:40.000 --> 40:40.280
In case you're here when
the season comes.

40:42.440 --> 40:44.320
Thank you.

40:50.800 --> 40:52.720
Is that
your lucky charm?

40:52.760 --> 40:55.840
What?
That thing you're wearing.

41:03.160 --> 41:04.000
Hmm?

41:04.000 --> 41:05.520
Hmm?

41:08.120 --> 41:09.200
I don't know.

41:11.200 --> 41:12.000
It just reminds me of my parents.

41:12.000 --> 41:12.920
It just reminds me of my parents.

41:17.240 --> 41:19.120
Where are they?

41:19.160 --> 41:20.000
They died.

41:20.000 --> 41:21.200
They died.

41:21.920 --> 41:24.440
A long time ago.

41:25.840 --> 41:27.320
They left and never came back.

41:28.400 --> 41:30.360
Like your dad.

41:36.880 --> 41:39.160
Do you miss them?

41:41.040 --> 41:43.000
When I think about them, yes.

41:46.560 --> 41:49.920
I... don't know if
I'll miss him.

41:55.160 --> 41:56.480
Didn't get along?

41:57.600 --> 42:00.000
Sometimes he took me fishing.

42:00.000 --> 42:01.320
Sometimes he took me fishing.

42:02.600 --> 42:07.080
But... when he was drunk.

42:09.440 --> 42:12.120
Hi. Look at me.

42:13.960 --> 42:16.000
I never met anyone who
got to choose their father.

42:16.000 --> 42:18.360
I never met anyone who
got to choose their father.

42:18.400 --> 42:20.680
Really?

42:34.080 --> 42:36.680
The stranger...
Mm-hmm?

42:36.720 --> 42:37.960
He promised to come fishing.

42:42.360 --> 42:44.840
Did you hear what I said?
Yes.

42:49.840 --> 42:51.640
You'll be able to fit that soon.

42:53.440 --> 42:55.400
Do you think we'll miss Dad?

43:00.560 --> 43:01.920
No.

43:09.120 --> 43:12.000
Uncle Nicholas.
Caleb. Lea.

43:12.000 --> 43:12.480
Uncle Nicholas.
Caleb. Lea.

43:13.120 --> 43:15.440
Scuse me, young man. I left something
in the back of my car.

43:15.480 --> 43:17.280
Would you mind getting it?
Yeah, sure.

43:22.960 --> 43:24.960
He's grown.

43:25.520 --> 43:27.280
Can I help with the tin?

43:28.320 --> 43:29.600
Let me...

43:31.760 --> 43:34.160
If I can still work one of these.

43:38.080 --> 43:40.040
What is it?

43:41.400 --> 43:44.000
I'm...

43:45.640 --> 43:47.040
..I was thinking...

43:49.160 --> 43:51.600
..you're alone now.
You and Caleb.

43:51.640 --> 43:52.000
So?

43:52.000 --> 43:53.320
So?

43:57.560 --> 43:59.800
I worry about you both.

44:00.920 --> 44:03.320
And I was wondering that...

44:03.360 --> 44:05.920
maybe you and I should consider...

44:09.560 --> 44:11.400
I'd treat you well.

44:11.840 --> 44:13.480
Please.

44:15.240 --> 44:16.000
Aaron didn't deserve you.

44:16.000 --> 44:18.240
Aaron didn't deserve you.

44:20.160 --> 44:21.960
You'll think about it?

44:29.320 --> 44:31.680
No.
Why?

44:32.720 --> 44:34.600
Because I don't like you, Nicholas.

44:35.360 --> 44:37.240
I'm not like my brother. I...

44:37.840 --> 44:39.760
I want you to want me.

44:42.560 --> 44:44.720
But I don't.

44:52.040 --> 44:54.200
They found Aaron's boat.

44:55.400 --> 44:56.000
Apparently his drain plugs
were open.

44:56.000 --> 44:57.760
Apparently his drain plugs
were open.

45:09.880 --> 45:12.000
Strange you didn't notice
before setting off.

45:12.000 --> 45:12.520
Strange you didn't notice
before setting off.

45:16.200 --> 45:18.160
Ah!
Here.

45:19.320 --> 45:20.000
This should keep you going.

45:20.000 --> 45:20.920
This should keep you going.

45:22.720 --> 45:24.800
I think we could be really happy.

45:28.280 --> 45:31.120
Here you go, young man!
No problem.

45:46.640 --> 45:48.640
Let's go.

46:18.600 --> 46:21.400
I don't let my son go
fishing with strangers.

46:29.600 --> 46:31.440
Did you come here to tell me that?

46:32.760 --> 46:34.120
I just thought you should know.

46:53.480 --> 46:55.360
Why are these men looking for you?

47:00.240 --> 47:02.240
I didn't do something
I was supposed to.

47:06.000 --> 47:07.960
What does that mean?

47:08.840 --> 47:11.080
It's about my father and brother.

47:13.440 --> 47:15.240
You told Caleb
you didn't have any family.

47:15.280 --> 47:17.280
Hmm.

47:20.280 --> 47:22.720
The less you know about all this,
the better.

47:23.680 --> 47:27.000
That's not good enough.
It's going to have to be.

47:33.440 --> 47:35.360
Better get going.

47:39.480 --> 47:41.480
Bye.

47:42.720 --> 47:43.920
Don't be afraid of me.

47:47.680 --> 47:49.120
I'm not.

48:36.000 --> 48:39.000
# And I will give to you

48:39.040 --> 48:40.000
# Summer wine

48:40.000 --> 48:41.600
# Summer wine

48:41.640 --> 48:47.000
# Oh, summer wine

48:48.520 --> 48:54.080
# My eyes grew heavy
And my lips, they could not speak

48:54.760 --> 48:56.000
# I tried to get up,
but I couldn't find my feet

48:56.000 --> 49:01.320
# I tried to get up,
but I couldn't find my feet

49:01.360 --> 49:04.000
# She reassured me
With an unfamiliar line

49:04.000 --> 49:07.240
# She reassured me
With an unfamiliar line

49:07.880 --> 49:10.800
# And then she gave to me

49:11.080 --> 49:12.000
# More summer wine

49:12.000 --> 49:14.040
# More summer wine

49:14.080 --> 49:20.000
# Oh, oh summer wine

49:20.000 --> 49:20.920
# Oh, oh summer wine

49:21.320 --> 49:26.920
# Strawberries, cherries
and an angel's kiss in spring

49:27.800 --> 49:28.000
# My summer wine is really
made from all these things

49:28.000 --> 49:34.440
# My summer wine is really
made from all these things

49:34.480 --> 49:36.000
# Take off your silver spurs
and help me pass the time

49:36.000 --> 49:40.960
# Take off your silver spurs
and help me pass the time

49:41.000 --> 49:44.000
# And I will give to you
summer wine

49:44.000 --> 49:46.680
# And I will give to you
summer wine

49:46.720 --> 49:52.000
# Mmm-mmm, summer wine

49:52.000 --> 49:52.120
# Mmm-mmm, summer wine

49:54.520 --> 50:00.000
# When I woke up the sun was shining
in my eyes

50:00.000 --> 50:00.760
# When I woke up the sun was shining
in my eyes

50:00.800 --> 50:06.640
# My silver spurs were gone
my head felt twice its size... #

50:34.960 --> 50:37.480
We must be afraid.

50:37.880 --> 50:39.800
Fear...

50:39.840 --> 50:40.000
..is a virtue.

50:40.000 --> 50:41.640
..is a virtue.

50:41.720 --> 50:43.960
It keeps us from danger,
from temptation.

50:44.720 --> 50:46.880
And fear protects us

50:46.920 --> 50:48.000
from the evil we carry
within ourselves.

50:48.000 --> 50:50.280
from the evil we carry
within ourselves.

50:50.360 --> 50:53.080
And from the wicked voice
that makes us confused

50:53.120 --> 50:55.440
right and wrong.

50:57.960 --> 51:00.400
It is not reason, but faith

51:00.440 --> 51:03.280
that helps keep the monsters at bay.

51:06.760 --> 51:08.640
Just like pain,

51:08.680 --> 51:11.400
it warns us when we're
damaging ourselves.

51:13.840 --> 51:15.400
Fear...

51:15.440 --> 51:17.560
..is a gift from God.

51:20.560 --> 51:24.600
Today, more than ever,
we must learn to be afraid.

51:25.960 --> 51:27.640
There are doors

51:27.680 --> 51:28.000
that can never be opened,
not even a crack, because

51:28.000 --> 51:29.960
that can never be opened,
not even a crack, because

51:30.000 --> 51:33.840
evil can enter through
the smallest of weaknesses.

51:36.280 --> 51:38.320
May God protect you.

51:53.000 --> 51:55.520
Meaningful words, pastor.

51:58.920 --> 52:00.000
Are they enough, hmm?

52:00.000 --> 52:01.360
Are they enough, hmm?

52:03.800 --> 52:06.200
I understand, sir.

52:06.240 --> 52:08.000
The stranger's still here.

52:08.000 --> 52:08.400
The stranger's still here.

52:10.000 --> 52:11.960
That's not good.

52:15.600 --> 52:16.000
Will you speak to your daughter
about me?

52:16.000 --> 52:17.400
Will you speak to your daughter
about me?

53:40.920 --> 53:42.720
He's a great kid.

53:46.880 --> 53:48.920
If I could take him
away from here...

53:50.520 --> 53:52.000
..I would.

53:52.000 --> 53:52.920
..I would.

53:53.640 --> 53:55.360
Why don't you?

54:00.560 --> 54:02.760
I've never known anywhere but here..

54:06.120 --> 54:08.000
It can be easy.

54:08.000 --> 54:08.240
It can be easy.

54:08.280 --> 54:09.880
Sometimes.

54:12.680 --> 54:14.680
Where will you go?

54:19.200 --> 54:21.240
Somewhere...

54:21.280 --> 54:23.760
..across the border.

54:27.120 --> 54:28.840
Why so far away?

54:34.760 --> 54:37.160
Mum! Mum!

54:37.200 --> 54:39.160
Come look.
OK.

54:40.120 --> 54:42.240
Hurry!
Alright!

54:42.280 --> 54:43.520
What?

54:45.120 --> 54:47.680
Oh.

54:48.240 --> 54:49.440
It's just a seal.

54:57.600 --> 55:00.200
Do you think Dad's like that
somewhere too?

55:02.800 --> 55:04.000
Hmm.

55:04.000 --> 55:04.640
Hmm.

55:05.440 --> 55:06.880
No.

55:07.240 --> 55:09.400
Come on.
Hmm.

55:45.080 --> 55:47.080
Lea?

55:50.800 --> 55:52.000
Where have you been?

55:52.000 --> 55:52.640
Where have you been?

55:54.200 --> 55:55.400
Fishing with Caleb.

55:55.440 --> 55:56.840
Hmm.

55:56.880 --> 55:58.440
Where is Caleb?

55:58.920 --> 56:00.000
Putting the boat away.
Mm-hmm.

56:00.000 --> 56:01.200
Putting the boat away.
Mm-hmm.

56:02.120 --> 56:04.200
You shouldn't be on your own.

56:06.560 --> 56:08.000
I'm tired, Dad.
Better if you were with Nicholas.

56:08.000 --> 56:09.360
I'm tired, Dad.
Better if you were with Nicholas.

56:10.840 --> 56:13.120
We can talk about this
in the morning. I'm going to bed.

56:13.160 --> 56:16.000
Nothing to talk about - I've decided.

56:40.440 --> 56:42.960
It was still a remarkable day.

56:45.800 --> 56:47.560
Give it to me.

56:49.520 --> 56:52.240
Would you want to do this
again sometime?

56:52.320 --> 56:54.360
I'll think about it.

56:57.800 --> 56:59.400
Come on.

57:02.720 --> 57:04.000
Ray?

57:04.000 --> 57:04.400
Ray?

57:05.880 --> 57:07.920
Don't you think,
at this point in our friendship,

57:07.960 --> 57:10.000
you can tell me your real name?

57:22.320 --> 57:24.560
John.

57:24.600 --> 57:26.320
Let's go.

57:28.160 --> 57:30.320
Hey.

57:30.360 --> 57:32.680
Just a dream.

57:32.720 --> 57:34.760
OK?

57:34.800 --> 57:36.000
I didn't want them to go to.
They shouldn't have gone!

57:36.000 --> 57:37.680
I didn't want them to go to.
They shouldn't have gone!

57:40.760 --> 57:42.800
She didn't choose you.

57:44.320 --> 57:47.200
The only people that
really love you

57:48.600 --> 57:50.320
are the ones that choose you.

57:53.080 --> 57:55.160
I'll never leave you alone.

57:55.800 --> 57:57.360
I promise.

58:06.640 --> 58:08.000
They just come late at night.

58:08.000 --> 58:08.560
They just come late at night.

58:08.600 --> 58:10.440
And they can pay a lot for it.

58:11.400 --> 58:14.440
I need to get all the money I can
to leave this dump.

58:14.480 --> 58:16.000
The guy who died, the fisherman?

58:16.000 --> 58:16.360
The guy who died, the fisherman?

58:16.400 --> 58:17.800
He was my best customer.

58:18.200 --> 58:20.160
His brother is a good customer
too, though.

58:20.200 --> 58:22.000
It's his turn now.

58:23.080 --> 58:24.000
What do you mean?

58:24.000 --> 58:24.560
What do you mean?

58:24.600 --> 58:26.680
Women make no decisions here.

58:27.080 --> 58:29.000
I bet they're already
getting the wedding going.

58:30.240 --> 58:32.000
It's down there.

58:32.000 --> 58:32.600
It's down there.

58:39.000 --> 58:40.000
Why don't you take two?

58:40.000 --> 58:40.840
Why don't you take two?

58:42.840 --> 58:45.080
One's enough.

58:47.840 --> 58:48.000
Thank you.

58:48.000 --> 58:49.440
Thank you.

59:09.120 --> 59:10.400
Mr Miller?

59:11.760 --> 59:12.000
Can I come in?

59:12.000 --> 59:13.440
Can I come in?

59:19.120 --> 59:20.000
Mr Miller?

59:20.000 --> 59:20.960
Mr Miller?

59:22.440 --> 59:24.240
Hi. Can I come in?

59:24.280 --> 59:26.280
Yeah.

59:26.440 --> 59:28.000
I, um... I have something.

59:28.000 --> 59:28.960
I, um... I have something.

59:31.400 --> 59:33.400
Would you take a seat with me?

59:36.800 --> 59:38.640
Had to check.

59:38.680 --> 59:40.000
That's my job.

59:40.040 --> 59:41.880
So, it's all there.

59:43.320 --> 59:44.000
Passport, money.

59:44.000 --> 59:45.280
Passport, money.

59:47.760 --> 59:50.400
Well, most of the money. I, um...

59:51.680 --> 59:52.000
I...I took some in exchange
for my loyalty.

59:52.000 --> 59:54.960
I...I took some in exchange
for my loyalty.

1:00:00.240 --> 1:00:02.760
Of course, if you...
if you feel it's unfair,

1:00:02.800 --> 1:00:04.720
I'll give the money back.

1:00:08.040 --> 1:00:09.720
Keep it.

1:00:11.040 --> 1:00:12.880
That's...
That's what I assumed.

1:00:12.920 --> 1:00:14.840
Get out.

1:00:14.880 --> 1:00:16.000
I'm sorry?

1:00:16.000 --> 1:00:16.200
I'm sorry?

1:00:17.280 --> 1:00:18.840
Get out.

1:00:25.000 --> 1:00:26.680
You have a good day, Mr Miller.

1:00:36.760 --> 1:00:39.200
I'm leaving.

1:00:39.600 --> 1:00:40.000
When?

1:00:40.000 --> 1:00:41.320
When?

1:00:42.720 --> 1:00:44.440
Soon.

1:01:00.080 --> 1:01:01.960
Are you getting married?

1:01:05.240 --> 1:01:07.000
Where did you hear that?

1:01:12.720 --> 1:01:14.360
No.

1:01:21.160 --> 1:01:22.600
Come with me.

1:01:27.080 --> 1:01:28.000
You and Caleb should
leave this place.

1:01:28.000 --> 1:01:28.760
You and Caleb should
leave this place.

1:01:39.840 --> 1:01:41.400
Shit!

1:01:45.320 --> 1:01:47.880
Hello, Lea.
Hi.

1:01:49.600 --> 1:01:51.160
Is everything OK?

1:01:52.240 --> 1:01:54.640
Yes, everything's fine.

1:01:55.760 --> 1:01:58.040
Let's go inside.
What?

1:01:58.080 --> 1:02:00.000
Um... I mean, no,
I'm fine here, thank you.

1:02:00.000 --> 1:02:01.800
Um... I mean, no,
I'm fine here, thank you.

1:02:04.840 --> 1:02:06.280
OK.

1:02:08.400 --> 1:02:10.400
Why you bothering her?
He's not bothering me.

1:02:10.440 --> 1:02:12.040
Nicholas, it's fine-
Shh, shh!

1:02:15.680 --> 1:02:16.000
You need to go.
I'm not going anywhere.

1:02:16.000 --> 1:02:17.880
You need to go.
I'm not going anywhere.

1:02:18.400 --> 1:02:20.440
I know what I'm doing.

1:02:20.480 --> 1:02:22.000
I know what I'm doing.

1:02:22.640 --> 1:02:24.000
Please.

1:02:24.000 --> 1:02:24.160
Please.

1:02:27.160 --> 1:02:28.240
Oh, Jesus.

1:02:28.280 --> 1:02:29.840
I'm a reasonable man.

1:02:30.480 --> 1:02:32.000
And I'm giving you the chance to go
quietly.Stop it. Please, OK-

1:02:32.000 --> 1:02:33.480
And I'm giving you the chance to go
quietly.Stop it. Please, OK-

1:02:33.520 --> 1:02:35.600
I'm here for your own protection!
I don't want it.

1:02:35.640 --> 1:02:38.160
I've not asked for that.
I've never asked for that.

1:02:38.200 --> 1:02:40.000
Do you understand me?

1:02:40.000 --> 1:02:40.280
Do you understand me?

1:02:40.760 --> 1:02:42.520
What are you doing?

1:02:42.560 --> 1:02:43.800
Stop!

1:02:47.160 --> 1:02:48.000
You're gonna leave.

1:02:48.000 --> 1:02:48.760
You're gonna leave.

1:02:50.080 --> 1:02:52.440
Nicholas, please stop. Come on!
Quiet!

1:02:52.520 --> 1:02:55.360
Or I will slit his throat.
No, you won't. You don't do that.

1:02:55.400 --> 1:02:56.000
Give me an answer.
Don't do it-

1:02:56.000 --> 1:02:57.280
Give me an answer.
Don't do it-

1:02:58.000 --> 1:02:59.720
Sorry. I'm sorry.

1:02:59.760 --> 1:03:01.520
Stay back.

1:03:01.560 --> 1:03:03.080
Stay back!

1:03:06.480 --> 1:03:08.080
Leave me alone!

1:03:26.840 --> 1:03:28.000
I'm done.

1:03:28.000 --> 1:03:28.840
I'm done.

1:03:30.040 --> 1:03:31.960
What about the other guy?

1:03:34.560 --> 1:03:36.000
It doesn't matter.

1:03:36.000 --> 1:03:36.280
It doesn't matter.

1:03:36.600 --> 1:03:38.320
I got everything back.

1:03:39.120 --> 1:03:40.800
Michael can do it.

1:03:41.840 --> 1:03:43.680
Michael isn't you.

1:03:47.560 --> 1:03:49.480
I can't do it anymore, Dad.

1:03:55.800 --> 1:03:57.360
Just this one.

1:04:28.240 --> 1:04:30.680
Thank you.

1:04:30.720 --> 1:04:32.000
You're OK.

1:04:32.000 --> 1:04:32.560
You're OK.

1:04:44.040 --> 1:04:46.200
What happened here?

1:04:53.040 --> 1:04:55.480
My husband.

1:04:55.520 --> 1:04:56.000
Mm-hmm.

1:04:56.000 --> 1:04:57.520
Mm-hmm.

1:04:59.600 --> 1:05:02.240
This is not gonna stop, you know.

1:05:05.480 --> 1:05:07.480
Yeah.

1:05:10.800 --> 1:05:12.000
I can't leave.

1:05:12.000 --> 1:05:12.480
I can't leave.

1:05:15.880 --> 1:05:17.880
Why not?

1:05:26.760 --> 1:05:28.000
Because I don't deserve to.

1:05:28.000 --> 1:05:28.760
Because I don't deserve to.

1:05:59.000 --> 1:06:00.000
I've killed too.

1:06:00.000 --> 1:06:01.240
I've killed too.

1:06:06.000 --> 1:06:07.160
More than once.

1:06:11.960 --> 1:06:13.720
Why?

1:06:17.160 --> 1:06:18.880
Because that's what I was
taught to do.

1:06:59.080 --> 1:07:01.440
How could this happen?

1:07:04.440 --> 1:07:06.440
Huh?

1:07:11.000 --> 1:07:12.000
OK, OK.

1:07:12.000 --> 1:07:12.520
OK, OK.

1:07:12.560 --> 1:07:15.560
This way, this way.

1:07:15.600 --> 1:07:17.560
This way.

1:07:36.280 --> 1:07:38.440
Lea!

1:07:38.480 --> 1:07:40.960
Lea!

1:07:41.000 --> 1:07:44.000
Lea, stop! Stop doing-
Get the fuck away from me!

1:07:44.000 --> 1:07:44.640
Lea, stop! Stop doing-
Get the fuck away from me!

1:07:44.680 --> 1:07:47.480
You! You keep away from me.

1:07:47.520 --> 1:07:49.280
Do you understand?

1:07:49.320 --> 1:07:51.240
No!
I will kill you.

1:07:52.920 --> 1:07:55.800
Just like I did Aaron.

1:08:18.680 --> 1:08:22.600
Mum! Look what I've made.

1:08:23.480 --> 1:08:24.000
Caleb, I need you to
go and pack up your things.

1:08:24.000 --> 1:08:26.360
Caleb, I need you to
go and pack up your things.

1:08:26.400 --> 1:08:28.960
We're leaving.

1:08:29.000 --> 1:08:30.680
Now!

1:08:30.720 --> 1:08:32.000
Where are we going?

1:08:32.000 --> 1:08:32.480
Where are we going?

1:08:32.520 --> 1:08:34.600
I don't know.

1:08:35.000 --> 1:08:36.680
Away.

1:08:36.720 --> 1:08:38.440
What about John?

1:08:49.280 --> 1:08:53.160
See, I told you I haven't seen him
for a couple of days.

1:08:59.840 --> 1:09:01.960
It hasn't been the long.

1:11:20.560 --> 1:11:21.760
It's just an animal den.

1:11:25.520 --> 1:11:27.480
See, I told you.

1:11:32.920 --> 1:11:34.800
Let's keep going.

1:11:41.280 --> 1:11:43.720
Father, forgive her.

1:11:43.760 --> 1:11:44.000
Please.

1:11:44.000 --> 1:11:45.600
Please.

1:12:02.480 --> 1:12:06.040
Why could Aaron have her,
and not me?

1:12:13.520 --> 1:12:15.840
To persist with a mistake,

1:12:15.880 --> 1:12:16.000
even when it is made
in good faith...

1:12:16.000 --> 1:12:20.920
even when it is made
in good faith...

1:12:25.120 --> 1:12:28.000
..opens the door to the devil.

1:12:34.200 --> 1:12:38.800
I have let the devil into my home.

1:12:45.080 --> 1:12:47.080
How have I...

1:12:51.440 --> 1:12:53.560
How have I...

1:12:56.840 --> 1:12:59.200
It's in me too.

1:13:16.440 --> 1:13:18.880
Cal?

1:13:19.680 --> 1:13:20.000
Caleb?

1:13:20.000 --> 1:13:20.680
Caleb?

1:13:24.000 --> 1:13:25.600
I'm here.

1:13:25.640 --> 1:13:27.440
What were you doing downstairs?

1:13:27.480 --> 1:13:28.000
That... Wasn't me.

1:13:28.000 --> 1:13:30.200
That... Wasn't me.

1:14:07.280 --> 1:14:08.000
I can't believe it either.

1:14:08.000 --> 1:14:09.560
I can't believe it either.

1:14:12.200 --> 1:14:15.720
A boat, filled with water...

1:14:15.760 --> 1:14:16.000
It was so quick.

1:14:16.000 --> 1:14:18.280
It was so quick.

1:14:20.160 --> 1:14:22.600
I stared death in the face.

1:14:31.960 --> 1:14:32.000
And God lifted me up.

1:14:32.000 --> 1:14:33.960
And God lifted me up.

1:14:37.040 --> 1:14:38.600
He wanted me to live.

1:14:42.720 --> 1:14:44.400
Do you know why?

1:14:48.320 --> 1:14:50.520
Because he's forgiven me.

1:14:51.800 --> 1:14:53.640
Caleb.

1:14:53.720 --> 1:14:56.000
Why don't you go and tell your
Grandfather what's happened?

1:14:56.000 --> 1:14:56.720
Why don't you go and tell your
Grandfather what's happened?

1:14:56.760 --> 1:14:58.720
Yes.

1:14:59.600 --> 1:15:03.560
We need to know if the Lord
can forgive you too.

1:15:08.520 --> 1:15:10.120
It's OK, Caleb. Go.

1:15:25.680 --> 1:15:28.000
Where are you going?

1:15:29.480 --> 1:15:31.560
Aaron, don't.

1:15:32.720 --> 1:15:35.720
We're a family.

1:15:35.760 --> 1:15:36.000
We should be together.

1:15:36.000 --> 1:15:37.560
We should be together.

1:18:20.520 --> 1:18:23.480
Wait here.

1:20:36.000 --> 1:20:38.040
Hi, Dad.

1:20:38.840 --> 1:20:40.000
Welcome home, son.

1:20:40.000 --> 1:20:40.600
Welcome home, son.

1:20:45.480 --> 1:20:48.000
Michael?
He's fine.

1:20:48.760 --> 1:20:51.600
Is he?

1:20:52.760 --> 1:20:54.480
Good.

1:20:59.280 --> 1:21:01.400
He was supposed to bring you home.

1:21:01.440 --> 1:21:03.960
I'm here.

1:21:04.000 --> 1:21:06.120
I knew you'd come back.

1:21:07.760 --> 1:21:09.640
Did you?

1:21:10.240 --> 1:21:12.000
I chose you.

1:21:12.000 --> 1:21:12.160
I chose you.

1:21:21.920 --> 1:21:24.480
I'm your father.

1:22:21.240 --> 1:22:23.400
Caleb, come on.

1:23:09.480 --> 1:23:12.000
# Strawberries, cherries

1:23:12.000 --> 1:23:12.680
# Strawberries, cherries

1:23:12.720 --> 1:23:17.320

# I walked in town on silver spurs
That jingled to

1:23:36.000 --> 1:23:36.840
# I walked in town on silver spurs
That jingled to

1:23:37.800 --> 1:23:43.600
# A song that I had only
sang to just a few

1:23:43.640 --> 1:23:44.000
# She saw my silver spurs
and said let's pass some time

1:23:44.000 --> 1:23:49.640
# She saw my silver spurs
and said let's pass some time

1:23:50.760 --> 1:23:52.000

and help me pass the time

# And I will give to you

1:24:49.400 --> 1:24:55.000
# She reassured me
with an unfamiliar line

1:24:56.080 --> 1:25:01.840

more summer wine
