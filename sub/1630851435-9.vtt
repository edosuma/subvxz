01:46.731 --> 01:47.982
He's gonna stand!

01:48.066 --> 01:49.526
Guevaru's gonna stand!

01:52.695 --> 01:53.780
Can he even stand?

01:53.863 --> 01:56.032
Even after taking that hit?

02:04.707 --> 02:05.959
My poor people.

02:12.507 --> 02:14.259
My poor people.

02:16.636 --> 02:17.720
I do this for them.

02:19.973 --> 02:21.432
My poor people!

02:51.421 --> 02:52.630
Guevaru got up!

02:53.173 --> 02:55.425
He's gonna try again. We can see more!

03:01.931 --> 03:04.100
I believed you'd get up.

03:10.315 --> 03:12.233
"Today is a good day to die."

03:14.360 --> 03:16.613
The US Army coined the phrase.

03:16.696 --> 03:18.865
During the Vietnam War,

03:18.948 --> 03:24.245
they say American soldiers
on the front line liked to say it.

03:25.747 --> 03:28.583
Guevaru, you of all people should know

03:28.666 --> 03:30.835
the true meaning behind the words.

03:31.419 --> 03:33.504
Yeah, it's a barefaced lie.

03:34.214 --> 03:36.007
It's not a phrase about dying.

03:36.633 --> 03:38.509
It's about living.

03:40.053 --> 03:42.430
It's about surviving the fierce battle,

03:42.513 --> 03:45.975
fighting bravely
and returning to your homeland alive.

03:48.061 --> 03:49.312
Exactly.

03:50.355 --> 03:52.273
The real truth…

03:52.357 --> 03:54.400
Is there's no good day to die,

03:55.318 --> 03:56.277
until you die.

03:57.195 --> 04:00.365
You always have to live for today!

04:05.870 --> 04:07.288
Guevaru.

04:17.006 --> 04:18.424
This is the finale.

04:19.008 --> 04:21.427
Oliva made a fist!

04:21.511 --> 04:22.679
He plans on ending it.

04:26.391 --> 04:27.725
"The wind rises…"

04:33.314 --> 04:34.524
All right.

04:35.942 --> 04:37.694
"…We must try to live."

04:39.821 --> 04:41.489
It's time to settle this!

04:46.452 --> 04:47.620
Biscuit Oliva.

04:48.246 --> 04:50.081
The strongest man in America.

04:51.374 --> 04:55.211
Your value lies in that body of yours.

04:56.254 --> 04:58.715
Within a frame of over 180 cm,

04:59.549 --> 05:05.221
lies more than 150 kg of muscle,
unprecedented in human history.

05:07.348 --> 05:10.226
The destructive force born of that body,

05:10.310 --> 05:12.687
is beyond that of my imagination…

05:13.187 --> 05:14.355
Not.

05:17.942 --> 05:18.860
What?

05:24.741 --> 05:25.783
That's…

05:25.867 --> 05:26.701
A tuxedo.

05:30.705 --> 05:34.375
The upright tuxedo fell, as if by command!

05:37.587 --> 05:41.341
The history of barehanded fights,
the history of martial arts,

05:41.424 --> 05:43.885
directly correlates with human history.

05:45.345 --> 05:48.765
The continuous cycle of having faith
in brawn, and denying it.

05:49.390 --> 05:52.852
Eventually, the loss of strength
led to the acquisition of speed.

05:54.187 --> 05:57.106
Muscle, loss of strength, and balance.

05:58.191 --> 06:01.319
Speed, angle, and weak point.

06:02.528 --> 06:06.783
Even in "chi" and breath work
there were various technical reforms

06:06.866 --> 06:08.534
and creative innovations.

06:09.619 --> 06:12.038
Thus, modern martial arts.

06:14.499 --> 06:19.712
But, there has been no progress
since the historic times of stone axes.

06:19.796 --> 06:22.298
There exists a definite blind spot

06:23.591 --> 06:24.967
I'm all ears.

06:26.135 --> 06:27.303
I will tell you.

06:28.346 --> 06:29.305
It's "support."

06:29.889 --> 06:31.557
Support?

06:33.184 --> 06:37.188
Even Chinese martial arts
with its 4,000 years of history,

06:37.855 --> 06:41.067
only sees the supporting ground
as a surface.

06:42.527 --> 06:43.694
Boxing,

06:44.654 --> 06:45.696
Sumo…

06:46.280 --> 06:48.449
All of these various martial arts,

06:48.533 --> 06:52.703
don't question how the body pushes
against the ground at an angle.

06:53.538 --> 06:56.749
No wonder they're forced to rely
on muscle.

06:59.252 --> 07:03.714
Because they don't recognize earth
as the greatest support.

07:05.341 --> 07:09.137
They're not even aware of what's
a millimeter under the earth.

07:10.430 --> 07:12.473
They merely stand there.

07:13.433 --> 07:15.435
You will experience it now.

07:17.061 --> 07:23.609
The rigidity of the core
that exists 6,378,000 meters underground.

07:27.697 --> 07:29.115
Feel it,

07:29.782 --> 07:30.616
feet of mine!

07:31.534 --> 07:33.703
To the deepest depths of the Earth.

07:33.786 --> 07:36.831
The most solid thing
located in the center of this planet…

07:39.333 --> 07:40.960
The core of the Earth!

07:56.392 --> 07:57.226
Guevaru.

07:59.270 --> 08:01.397
He wants to congratulate you.

08:02.064 --> 08:02.899
Bosch!

08:05.735 --> 08:08.154
You've bested me. Forgive me.

08:08.779 --> 08:10.907
Something's wrong. This can't be.

08:10.990 --> 08:14.994
And this guy wants to greet you.

08:16.245 --> 08:17.246
What?

08:17.955 --> 08:18.915
Hey.

08:18.998 --> 08:19.874
Why?

08:19.957 --> 08:23.044
I'm called the Earth's strongest
or something…

08:23.711 --> 08:25.630
Why is this man here?

08:26.797 --> 08:28.674
But that's not me.

08:31.677 --> 08:33.971
Guevaru, it's you.

08:34.514 --> 08:35.932
Just as I thought.

08:36.015 --> 08:38.059
Well, duh!

08:38.142 --> 08:39.435
Yeah?

08:42.522 --> 08:43.940
Something like this,

08:44.524 --> 08:45.942
is usually…

08:47.985 --> 08:48.945
Is usually…

08:51.948 --> 08:52.782
A dream.

09:33.864 --> 09:34.740
Hey.

09:37.326 --> 09:39.745
Carry Mr. Guevaru.

09:40.413 --> 09:43.749
Courteously and with care.

09:49.839 --> 09:51.757
The fight is over.

09:53.342 --> 09:55.761
We won't hear the singing anymore.

09:56.929 --> 09:58.264
You're so strong.

09:58.848 --> 09:59.682
Yeah.

10:00.600 --> 10:03.894
Your faith in your body was stronger.

10:04.437 --> 10:05.813
Easy for you to say.

10:05.896 --> 10:08.190
Guevaru was strong,

10:08.274 --> 10:10.276
but he didn't have the love.

10:11.611 --> 10:13.529
The love for muscle.

10:15.489 --> 10:18.409
At a much earlier stage than I,

10:18.909 --> 10:22.913
he said goodbye to
an irreplaceable love: muscles.

10:23.497 --> 10:27.501
Loss of strength? Technique?
Balance? Support?

10:28.044 --> 10:31.297
Guevaru dallied with those other loves.

10:32.381 --> 10:34.467
But she took her revenge.

10:34.550 --> 10:37.345
She's the jealous type, you see.

10:39.055 --> 10:41.682
The body you see right now,

10:41.766 --> 10:44.852
is actually not the real size.

10:46.937 --> 10:51.067
So how is it kept so compact?

10:51.942 --> 10:53.569
Compact?

10:53.653 --> 10:54.570
He's huge.

10:57.948 --> 11:00.326
It's because I'm holding it in.

11:00.910 --> 11:02.578
Holding it in?

11:03.245 --> 11:08.918
But let's say if I were to open
the door that holds these muscles.

11:09.794 --> 11:11.796
The size would most likely

11:12.672 --> 11:15.216
tear apart my skin where I stand,

11:16.175 --> 11:18.094
crush all of you,

11:18.177 --> 11:20.304
destroy the building,

11:20.388 --> 11:22.556
breach the outer gate,

11:22.640 --> 11:25.017
and reach even the heavens!

11:26.519 --> 11:27.353
No.

11:27.436 --> 11:29.605
No way. That's impossible.

11:31.148 --> 11:32.108
Baki.

11:32.692 --> 11:34.694
My meals in a day

11:34.777 --> 11:39.824
have never dropped below 10,000 calories.

11:42.243 --> 11:44.745
Even for Olympic-level athletes,

11:44.829 --> 11:48.874
it isn't easy ingesting more than
10,000 calories in a day.

11:50.584 --> 11:52.461
Ten thousand calories.

11:53.087 --> 11:56.298
The Japanese are fond
of eating rice balls, yes?

11:56.382 --> 11:59.760
That amount of calories
is equal to about 500 rice balls.

12:02.346 --> 12:03.347
But look!

12:03.848 --> 12:07.268
I keep my fat percentage
within five percent.

12:07.852 --> 12:13.524
It's a diet already beyond
what physical activity can burn off

12:13.607 --> 12:15.276
and still it's five percent.

12:15.359 --> 12:17.778
It's illogical.

12:17.862 --> 12:20.823
But when you say it,

12:20.906 --> 12:22.533
it doesn't sound like a lie.

12:25.035 --> 12:26.704
The space shuttle,

12:26.787 --> 12:29.582
has a fuel tank far larger than its body.

12:29.665 --> 12:33.419
In order to use it all
before it enters the upper atmosphere,

12:34.211 --> 12:37.423
it continues to burn, even now.

12:38.716 --> 12:42.011
I suppress
what is trying to expand within.

12:42.094 --> 12:44.555
Holding in, sealing in,

12:44.638 --> 12:47.099
pushing in, and binding it.

12:47.641 --> 12:52.313
I continue to confine it.
I can't let up, even for even a moment.

12:54.690 --> 12:56.567
I didn't know that.

12:57.485 --> 12:58.694
Who would think,

12:58.778 --> 13:01.155
that we're all alive right now

13:01.238 --> 13:05.075
thanks to you
vigilantly keeping yourself compact.

13:05.701 --> 13:07.077
We're all so grateful!

13:10.664 --> 13:12.833
What's amazing about me

13:12.917 --> 13:17.338
is that despite that, I'm still able
to get a good night's sleep.

13:20.424 --> 13:21.592
Hey.

13:23.385 --> 13:24.470
Let me down.

13:24.553 --> 13:25.596
Oh!

13:25.679 --> 13:27.681
Oh, sorry, sorry.

13:29.683 --> 13:30.518
Boy,

13:31.018 --> 13:33.604
you want a round with me that much?

13:36.941 --> 13:37.858
This power,

13:38.651 --> 13:39.610
it's as if…

13:40.194 --> 13:41.362
Bring it on!

13:41.946 --> 13:42.780
I'll fight.

13:52.039 --> 13:54.708
I apologize for talking big.

13:55.459 --> 13:58.379
It's a lie that
I'm bigger than the building.

13:58.462 --> 14:00.256
I know that!

14:00.714 --> 14:05.886
And actually,
I didn't refine these muscles to fight.

14:07.972 --> 14:09.890
This body…

14:15.980 --> 14:19.775
was made to do this for this person.

14:22.987 --> 14:24.905
H-Hey…

14:25.990 --> 14:28.409
Sorry to make you wait, Maria.

14:32.955 --> 14:35.499
Heave, ho!

14:36.041 --> 14:38.752
On a moonlit night

14:38.836 --> 14:41.422
Heave, ho!

14:42.006 --> 14:44.425
Raise the anchor

14:44.508 --> 14:46.760
Heave, ho!

14:47.261 --> 14:49.847
On a stormy night

14:49.930 --> 14:51.932
Heave, ho!

14:52.600 --> 14:55.352
Hoist the sail!

14:55.436 --> 14:57.938
With the stars as the guide

14:58.022 --> 15:00.858
Set course for treasure

15:00.941 --> 15:06.363
Put the rum aside until then!

15:06.447 --> 15:08.449
Heave, ho!

15:09.033 --> 15:11.702
On a moonlit night

15:11.785 --> 15:13.704
Heave, ho!

15:14.538 --> 15:17.207
On a stormy night

15:17.291 --> 15:19.585
Heave, ho!

15:20.085 --> 15:22.880
Hoist the sail!

15:38.729 --> 15:40.314
No witnesses?

15:40.898 --> 15:43.067
It was empty when you woke in the morning?

15:54.745 --> 15:58.457
It's not for me, but for me and Maria?

16:06.215 --> 16:07.424
It's money.

16:07.508 --> 16:09.802
It's his island's currency.

16:09.885 --> 16:10.761
Cap!

16:21.438 --> 16:23.857
When did he do this?

16:24.441 --> 16:26.610
It was out of consideration for you.

16:27.194 --> 16:30.197
If he had wanted
to walk right out the front,

16:30.280 --> 16:33.117
he's a man with
the ability to easily do so.

16:34.702 --> 16:37.162
You can't exactly pretend you didn't see

16:37.246 --> 16:40.040
an inmate walk out the gate.

16:41.458 --> 16:43.836
If you did, you guys would lose face.

16:45.462 --> 16:47.548
That's why he escaped.

16:47.631 --> 16:50.092
Your sentence will be far lighter

16:50.175 --> 16:52.886
for not noticing rather than ignoring it.

16:53.887 --> 16:55.597
He was being considerate.

16:55.681 --> 16:57.641
Accept it with gratitude.

16:59.893 --> 17:00.728
Now,

17:01.729 --> 17:04.023
what should I do with this?

17:04.648 --> 17:06.358
You can't use it here,

17:06.442 --> 17:08.527
nor in America proper.

17:09.028 --> 17:10.654
I see.

17:11.321 --> 17:13.907
There's only one place
in the world you can use it.

17:14.700 --> 17:16.910
It's an invitation.

17:19.830 --> 17:22.666
"Come to the island
if you want to use it," huh?

17:23.500 --> 17:24.793
Are you going to go?

17:26.587 --> 17:28.047
Maybe not today.

18:00.037 --> 18:01.705
Where were you, boss?

18:02.289 --> 18:04.833
It doesn't take a month to use the toilet!

18:04.917 --> 18:06.710
Your ax was still in the tree!

18:06.794 --> 18:08.962
Yo, I'm back.

18:10.005 --> 18:11.465
Back?

18:11.548 --> 18:12.424
Oliva.

18:13.467 --> 18:14.468
Oli…

18:15.928 --> 18:16.970
One month ago…

18:18.722 --> 18:21.266
He's apparently the strongest in America.

18:21.350 --> 18:25.104
His arm is 70 cm thick! About this much?

18:26.021 --> 18:28.107
Could you beat him, boss?

18:28.941 --> 18:30.359
Maybe I'll give it try.

18:30.442 --> 18:31.944
Expected nothing less.

18:32.027 --> 18:33.195
Mr. President!

18:34.071 --> 18:35.948
What?

18:36.031 --> 18:37.699
You went to America?

18:38.784 --> 18:41.495
So what was Biscuit Oliva like?

18:44.748 --> 18:45.999
He was strong.

18:48.377 --> 18:50.045
Did you win?

18:51.588 --> 18:52.422
No.

18:53.090 --> 18:54.091
Oh!

18:54.591 --> 18:56.927
This guy had a kid again!

18:57.010 --> 18:57.970
Twins at that!

18:58.053 --> 18:59.513
What, twins?

18:59.596 --> 19:01.598
Wait, didn't you have…

19:03.392 --> 19:04.434
How many is this?

19:04.518 --> 19:05.477
Nine.

19:08.105 --> 19:09.606
You have too many!

19:09.690 --> 19:10.858
Well…

19:14.111 --> 19:16.655
Speaking of which, old lady Sara's pig!

19:16.738 --> 19:18.699
That's right! It's constipated.

19:18.782 --> 19:20.784
Oh, same as last month?

19:20.868 --> 19:23.662
Yeah, what is he feeding it?

19:32.504 --> 19:33.672
Roll call!

19:33.755 --> 19:36.049
Don't dawdle, you slugs!

19:36.133 --> 19:37.426
Hurry up and line up!

19:38.010 --> 19:39.428
Room one, report!

19:40.053 --> 19:41.180
Room one, present!

19:41.263 --> 19:42.347
Room two, present!

19:42.431 --> 19:43.640
Room three, present!

19:43.724 --> 19:44.933
Room four, present!

19:45.017 --> 19:48.812
There's no need to tell you again
that you're all human scum!

19:48.896 --> 19:50.564
You have absolutely no freedom.

19:50.647 --> 19:53.483
You're only allowed to breathe!

19:53.984 --> 19:57.112
Curse yourselves for having to wake up
at a place like this!

19:57.988 --> 19:59.948
-Excuse me.
-Huh?

20:08.582 --> 20:11.084
What is it boy? You need to pee-pee?

20:11.168 --> 20:12.794
Can I step outside?

20:12.878 --> 20:13.712
What?

20:14.379 --> 20:18.467
I want to get some air,
just for four to five minutes.

20:23.555 --> 20:24.973
What?

20:25.557 --> 20:26.975
Sorry.

20:28.560 --> 20:29.394
Freeze!

20:30.562 --> 20:31.480
Sorry.

20:37.152 --> 20:38.987
See you when you get back!

20:42.074 --> 20:43.492
Go, boy!

20:43.575 --> 20:45.744
Breathe in plenty of outside air!

20:45.827 --> 20:47.496
And then just leave!

20:47.579 --> 20:48.747
Freeze!

20:52.584 --> 20:53.877
It's an escape!

20:53.961 --> 20:55.879
He's just gonna walk out the front?

21:44.386 --> 21:47.639
Unfortunately,
you won't be breathing in outside air.

21:47.723 --> 21:51.059
Go back peacefully, Baki Hanma.

21:55.647 --> 21:58.025
You made quite the effort.

21:58.108 --> 22:01.236
Will you tell me the reason
behind your reckless action?

22:02.195 --> 22:06.366
Well, I thought maybe I'll also become…

22:07.492 --> 22:08.368
Unchained.

22:09.161 --> 22:12.622
And what's your conclusion at this point?

22:16.251 --> 22:17.210
I can do it.

22:19.087 --> 22:19.963
I think.

23:46.716 --> 23:51.179
