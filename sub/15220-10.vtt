One of the richest guys in the
country.

05:45.879 --> 05:51.593
He started out buying small mom and
pop companies, automating them, then
selling them for profit.

05:51.593 --> 05:55.764

put more people out of work than the

Definitely, sir. He worries me.

07:31.985 --> 07:34.529
Perhaps we should consider
termination?

07:34.529 --> 07:36.698

face.

intention of demolishing the

job and let me worry about mine.

didn't get you in trouble.

15:36.583 --> 15:39.127
Nothing Pearson does
surprises me any more.

15:39.127 --> 15:42.088
Good luck on the Henderson deal,
sir.

15:42.088 --> 15:44.090
Luck had nothing to do with it.

15:44.090 --> 15:47.761
I had the guts and the fortitude to
automate Henderson's bakery.

15:47.761 --> 15:50.388
That's why United Federal wants to
buy it, not luck.

15:50.388 --> 15:52.515
Quite right, sir.

15:52.515 --> 15:54.392
Quite right.

15:58.438 --> 16:01.483
George, what the hell are these suits
doing back here?

16:02.984 --> 16:05.862
Pearson, what the hell are you doing
here? Where's George?

16:05.862 --> 16:09.866
Well, sir, he had a little emergency
come up at home.

16:09.866 --> 16:12.452
I was carrying out your suits

16:12.452 --> 16:14.913
and he asked me if I could just
cover for him.

16:16.289 --> 16:19.209
Where the hell did these pictures
come from? Pictures, sir?

16:20.418 --> 16:24.089
Ha, ha, yeah, those. You know, I was
cleaning out your closet.

16:24.089 --> 16:27.717
And I came across those. They just
fell in with the suits.

16:27.717 --> 16:31.388
When I was picking everything up, I
couldn't help but notice...

16:31.388 --> 16:33.056
the woman.

16:33.056 --> 16:35.892
Is she a relative?
She was my mother.

16:37.936 --> 16:40.897
She passed away shortly after this
picture was taken.

16:41.856 --> 16:43.900
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

16:46.278 --> 16:48.321
She was a very beautiful woman.

16:49.489 --> 16:52.951
Your father was a lucky guy.
My father was a bum!

16:52.951 --> 16:57.038
He left us when I was three.
My mother had to scrub floors just so
we could eat.

16:57.038 --> 17:01.334
That poor woman died on her hands and
knees, cleaning someone else's
bathroom.

17:03.420 --> 17:04.880
Well, I...

17:24.983 --> 17:26.984
Now?
Go ahead.

17:32.616 --> 17:35.785
Why have we stopped?
I think we've got a flat tyre.

17:35.785 --> 17:38.830
Don't be ridiculous. We would have
felt it.

I don't know. I think we do.

17:46.004 --> 17:48.173
Er, yeah, look at that.

17:48.173 --> 17:51.218
Oh, this is great. I'll never make
that meeting now.

17:52.761 --> 17:56.014
Pearson! This is skid row, for crying
out loud!

17:56.014 --> 17:59.559
We've got no business driving here.
No wonder we have a flat. Sorry, sir.

just seen a ghost.

18:51.736 --> 18:54.781
No, I just thought... Do you know
those boys?

18:54.781 --> 18:56.908
What boys?

18:56.908 --> 18:58.994
The ones that were...

19:00.078 --> 19:03.206
Never mind. What brings you to this
part of town?

19:03.206 --> 19:05.750
Well, we had a flat tyre.

19:05.750 --> 19:10.213
How unfortunate. There's a pay phone
around the corner. It's inside.

19:10.213 --> 19:13.967
That's Stigler's coffee shop.
Yes. How did you know that?

19:13.967 --> 19:16.094
I grew up on this street.

19:16.094 --> 19:18.221

19:18.221 --> 19:20.807
Charlie O'Riley used to live there.

19:20.807 --> 19:24.311
Charlie and I used to do everything
together when we were kids.

It's hard to imagine you as a kid,
er, sir.

19:27.731 --> 19:32.652
We used to play stick ball for hours,
every day, just like these kids.

20:36.216 --> 20:39.427
Are you kidding? Since we were kids!

20:39.427 --> 20:42.722
Hey, Max, you remember old Charlie
O'Riley?

20:42.722 --> 20:45.934
How could I forget him? You were
like Siamese twins.

20:45.934 --> 20:50.313
Remember the time we dropped them
water bags out the window on ol'
lady Malone?

20:50.313 --> 20:52.357
Whooooa!
That's right.

20:52.357 --> 20:55.318
She chased us, and we were laughing
so hard, we fell down.

20:55.318 --> 20:59.406
Charlie snuck back to her house and
locked her out. He did!

20:59.406 --> 21:02.701

What, Max? Know what?

21:13.044 --> 21:15.171
Charlie was killed.

21:15.171 --> 21:18.258
Yeah, about four years ago.

21:18.258 --> 21:21.094
How?
He got drunk.

21:21.094 --> 21:24.347

in front of a bus.

21:24.347 --> 21:26.141
Yeah.

21:26.141 --> 21:30.562
He'd been in pretty bad shape since
he lost his job at Henderson's.

21:30.562 --> 21:34.190
The bakery? Yeah, he got laid off
when they automated.

21:34.190 --> 21:36.735
Couldn't find another job. Went on
the skids.

21:36.735 --> 21:38.653
What a shame.

21:39.696 --> 21:41.740
He had five kids.

Get outta here!

Get outta here! Put it away! It's on

What's that?

It's Polish. Honey nut cake and poppy
seed jelly roll cake.

30:30.708 --> 30:32.752
It's a tradition.

30:34.128 --> 30:36.172
More piernik, Mr Blake?

30:37.382 --> 30:39.550
Oh, no, I really couldn't.

30:39.550 --> 30:42.887
You don't like it?
No. I mean, yes, I do!

30:42.887 --> 30:44.639
It's delicious.

30:44.639 --> 30:47.684
My mother used to make this for me
every Christmas.

30:47.684 --> 30:50.728
Well, I can't think of a nicer
compliment.

30:50.728 --> 30:52.897
You made this?

30:52.897 --> 30:55.650
She sings and she cooks.
It's amazing.

30:55.650 --> 31:00.405
No, no, it's just... It's just that
there's so much I don't know
about you.

31:01.989 --> 31:04.117
And I'd like that to change.

31:08.496 --> 31:12.583
Now, would you just look at this?
This is better than anything we
could have dreamed of.

31:12.583 --> 31:14.877
You've saved a man and the mission.

31:14.877 --> 31:17.046
Looks like it, doesn't it?

31:17.046 --> 31:19.632
What do you mean? You did it, Sam.

31:19.632 --> 31:22.885

and let nature take its course.

31:24.554 --> 31:26.848

31:27.598 --> 31:29.976
Well, what have you got there?

31:29.976 --> 31:32.103
This is for you.

31:32.103 --> 31:34.272
For me?

31:34.272 --> 31:36.274
His name is Sheldon.

31:37.859 --> 31:39.652
Come here.

31:41.612 --> 31:44.115
I'd put my money on a horse named
Sheldon any day.

31:44.115 --> 31:48.661
Ziggy says there's a 97% chance

31:48.661 --> 31:50.747

What?

31:55.126 --> 31:56.669
93?

I don't know why. Me first!

32:03.509 --> 32:05.553
I think I do.

32:06.471 --> 32:08.181
Thanks.

32:08.181 --> 32:11.225
I made him cos Santa Claus can't come
visit us this year.

32:11.225 --> 32:14.645
We don't have a home to live in.
Do you have a home?

32:22.236 --> 32:24.405
I underestimated you, Captain.

32:24.405 --> 32:27.241
Pretty clever, using the kids.
Excuse me?

32:27.241 --> 32:31.913
Don't play dumb! You were trying to
make a mark out of me and I was
actually falling for it.

32:31.913 --> 32:33.998
But it isn't going to work.

32:35.124 --> 32:37.794
You hear that, Pearson? It's not
going to work.

32:38.503 --> 32:40.713
This building comes down in one
week!

32:40.713 --> 32:43.758
It's gonna take a lot more than
piernik and makowiec

32:43.758 --> 32:46.010
and some three-legged horse
to stop it!

32:47.261 --> 32:48.471

I won't be needing you any more
tonight.

33:11.268 --> 33:14.605
Sir, if you just give me...
Good night, Pearson.

33:14.605 --> 33:16.273
Mr Blake...

33:17.399 --> 33:19.526
..I was not trying to trick you.

33:19.526 --> 33:22.070
What were you trying to do?

33:22.070 --> 33:24.615
Well, sir...

33:24.615 --> 33:28.452
I was trying... ..to change me
into somebody that I'm not.

33:29.787 --> 33:31.997
Now I'm going to bed.

33:31.997 --> 33:35.834
And you'd better hope that I still
don't wanna fire you when I get up
in the morning.

33:35.834 --> 33:39.505
And get rid of that damn tree!

33:43.801 --> 33:45.302
Yes, sir.

33:50.766 --> 33:52.810
What's with Ebenezer there?

33:54.520 --> 33:57.731
He's ready to tear down the mission
with his bare hands.

33:57.731 --> 33:59.691
I think I'm making things worse.

33:59.691 --> 34:02.820
Well, you gotta save the man's soul
or you can't leap out of here.

34:02.820 --> 34:05.114
Think about the people down at the
mission.

34:05.114 --> 34:07.282
He's never gonna believe me again.

34:07.282 --> 34:09.743
I'll be lucky if I have a job in the
morning.

34:09.743 --> 34:12.871
It would take a miracle to convince
him that he's wrong.

34:15.916 --> 34:19.168
You know something, I don't like
that look on your face.

34:21.295 --> 34:22.714
Uh-uh.

34:23.799 --> 34:26.635
We're Scrooging Blake, right.
Right.

34:26.635 --> 34:30.389
Right. And I think we should just
keep at it.

34:30.389 --> 34:35.601
Keep at it? And give him
the Ghost of Christmas Future.

he? It's good make-up.

Are you hard of hearing? I'm here to
show you your future. Ooooh!

35:45.672 --> 35:48.842
Well, maybe I should just show you
your future!

smoking a cigar, staring at me!

brought you down here. Ask him.

Mr Blake!

44:39.665 --> 44:41.708
What a nice surprise.

44:44.336 --> 44:46.839
Do you have room
for one more lost soul?

44:48.424 --> 44:50.467
Of course.

44:52.177 --> 44:54.346
What happens to him, Al?

44:54.346 --> 44:57.641
Well, in six months, he marries
Downey.

44:57.641 --> 44:59.810
And they have three kids.

44:59.810 --> 45:01.937
That's great.
Yeah, that's great.

45:01.937 --> 45:04.273
So I guess
he never builds the plaza, huh?

45:05.232 --> 45:07.401
No, he does build it.

45:07.401 --> 45:09.778
And he puts the mission on the first
floor.

45:12.865 --> 45:14.032
Hmmm.

45:16.243 --> 45:19.788
I wonder if he'd have knocked on
that door if you hadn't put that star
up there.

45:21.331 --> 45:24.334
I didn't put the star up there.

45:36.680 --> 45:38.724
Merry Christmas, Al.

45:40.184 --> 45:42.227
Merry Christmas, Sam.
