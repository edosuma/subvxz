00:12.633 --> 00:13.700
(Meredith) GRATITUDE,

00:13.733 --> 00:15.400
APPRECIATION,

00:15.433 --> 00:17.433
GIVING THANKS--

00:17.467 --> 00:19.367
NO MATTER WHAT WORDS
YOU USE,

00:19.400 --> 00:21.400
IT ALL MEANS THE SAME THING--

00:21.433 --> 00:23.300
HAPPY.

00:25.333 --> 00:27.633
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE HAPPY,

00:27.667 --> 00:31.267
GRATEFUL FOR FRIENDS, FAMILY.

00:31.300 --> 00:32.733
HAPPY TO JUST BE ALIVE...

00:32.767 --> 00:34.267
(Izzie) HEY.

00:34.300 --> 00:35.533
WHETHER WE LIKE IT OR NOT.

00:35.567 --> 00:37.600
WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?
(doorbell rings)

00:37.633 --> 00:39.600
ANSWERING THE DOOR.

00:39.633 --> 00:42.433
YOU'RE GOING
TO THE HOSPITAL?
YES, BUT--

00:42.467 --> 00:44.833
MEREDITH, EVERYONE IS SUPPOSED
TO BE IN THE KITCHEN BY 9 A.M.

00:44.867 --> 00:46.767
TO HELP ME MAKE DINNER.
IT'S THANKSGIVING.

00:46.800 --> 00:48.300
I'M REALLY NOT IN THE MOOD.

00:48.333 --> 00:50.233
BUT IT'S LIKE A FAMILY--
(rings)

00:50.267 --> 00:52.033
DOORBELL.

00:54.300 --> 00:56.400
THIS WHERE GEORGIE LIVES?

00:56.433 --> 00:57.533
GEORGIE?

00:57.567 --> 00:58.633
O'MALLEY.
WHERE IS HE, UPSTAIRS?

00:58.667 --> 01:01.267
OH, GEORGE. YEAH.

01:01.300 --> 01:03.833
(Men) O'MALLEY!
O'MALLEY!

01:03.867 --> 01:05.767
SHOULD I CALL THE POLICE?

01:05.800 --> 01:08.067
O'MALLEY!

01:09.567 --> 01:10.633
MEREDITH, I'M SERIOUS!

01:10.667 --> 01:13.567
YOU NEED TO BE BACK HERE
FOR DINNER AT 6. I MEAN IT!

01:13.600 --> 01:17.400
FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO...

01:17.433 --> 01:20.467
(All) HAPPY THANKSGIVING!

01:20.500 --> 01:23.400
(ferry horn bellows)

01:24.533 --> 01:26.400
SO, UM...

01:26.433 --> 01:28.800
I WAS THINKING

01:28.833 --> 01:32.067
THAT WE COULD...

01:32.100 --> 01:33.633
HAVE SEX TONIGHT.

01:33.667 --> 01:34.600
(laughs)

01:34.633 --> 01:35.567
(laughs)

01:35.600 --> 01:36.800
YEAH.

01:36.833 --> 01:40.267
LOOK, I KNOW WE'RE BOTH
GONNA FEEL WEIRD ABOUT IT,

01:40.300 --> 01:41.667
AND IT'S THE FIRST TIME--

01:41.700 --> 01:43.533
SINCE MARK.

01:43.567 --> 01:45.733
AND MEREDITH.

01:47.633 --> 01:50.500
I HAVE THE DAY OFF.
DO YOU HAVE THE DAY OFF?

01:50.533 --> 01:52.400
I HAVE TO STOP BY
THE HOSPITAL.

01:52.433 --> 01:54.067
I HAVE PATIENTS
I NEED TO CHECK ON.

01:54.100 --> 01:56.800
IF YOU HAVE THE DAY OFF,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

01:56.833 --> 01:58.733
I WAS THINKIN'
WE COULD HAVE SEX TONIGHT.

01:58.767 --> 02:01.533
COME ON, I MADE
A RESERVATION AT NOON.

02:01.567 --> 02:03.467
I FIGURE WE COULD DO
THE THANKSGIVING THING,

02:03.500 --> 02:05.400
YOU KNOW, AND THEN...

02:05.433 --> 02:07.367
I DON'T KNOW,
JUST RIP THE STITCHES.

02:07.400 --> 02:08.567
GET IT OVER WITH.

02:08.600 --> 02:10.467
NO ANESTHESIA.

02:10.500 --> 02:13.167
RIGHT.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

02:13.200 --> 02:14.367
(Miranda) GREY...

02:14.400 --> 02:17.367
WE'RE WORKING WITH
A TEMP ATTENDING TODAY.

02:17.400 --> 02:19.300
DR. KENT--HE'S SUBBING IN
FROM MERCY WEST.

02:19.333 --> 02:20.667
WE NEED TO GET HIM ORIENTED.

02:20.700 --> 02:23.133
AND THANK YOU FOR VOLUNTEERING
TO COME IN.

02:23.167 --> 02:26.067
SAVED ME FROM HAVING TO CHOOSE
AN INTERN TO TORTURE.

02:26.067 --> 02:27.533
HAPPY TO BE TORTURED.

02:27.567 --> 02:29.433
NOT A FAN OF THANKSGIVING?

02:29.467 --> 02:32.600
NOT A WHOLE HELL OF A LOT
TO BE THANKFUL FOR.

02:32.633 --> 02:34.300
I LIKE THANKSGIVING.

02:34.333 --> 02:36.233
A DAY PEOPLE SPEND
WITH THEIR FAMILIES.

02:36.267 --> 02:38.167
TOO MUCH FAMILY TIME
TRIGGERS DEPRESSION,

02:38.200 --> 02:40.567
REPRESSED CHILDHOOD RAGE,

02:40.600 --> 02:42.067
BITTER DISPUTES
OVER THE REMOTE

02:42.100 --> 02:43.833
AND WAY TOO MUCH ALCOHOL.

02:43.867 --> 02:45.767
PEOPLE GET STUPID,
PEOPLE GET VIOLENT,

02:45.800 --> 02:47.133
PEOPLE GET HURT.

02:47.167 --> 02:49.067
AND THAT'S A GOOD THING
BECAUSE...

02:49.100 --> 02:50.567
SURGERIES, GREY.

02:50.600 --> 02:51.767
LOTS AND LOTS
OF SURGERIES.

02:51.800 --> 02:53.700
OH, I NEVER THOUGHT
OF THAT.

02:53.733 --> 02:57.067
THE STUPIDITY
OF THE HUMAN RACE, GREY--

02:57.067 --> 02:58.767
BE THANKFUL FOR THAT.

03:01.100 --> 03:02.833
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
AT HOME.

03:02.867 --> 03:04.267
SO ARE YOU.

03:04.300 --> 03:06.200
BEST MAZE PROCEDURE
I'VE EVER DONE.

03:06.233 --> 03:07.733
UNDER AN HOUR.

03:07.767 --> 03:09.433
I THOUGHT YOU HAD
THE DAY OFF.

03:09.467 --> 03:11.367
I DID. I DO.
I'M LEAVING.

03:11.400 --> 03:13.200
I SIMPLY LIKE TO START
MY DAY CUTTING.

03:13.233 --> 03:15.133
IT GIVES ME A RUSH.
YEAH, ADMIT IT.

03:15.167 --> 03:16.667
YOU CAN'T FUNCTION
10 FEET AWAY FROM THE HOSPITAL.

03:16.700 --> 03:18.833
OH, I NOTICE
YOU'RE BOTH HERE.

03:18.867 --> 03:20.800
WELL, I'M HERE FOR AN HOUR.
I'M ON MY WAY HOME.

03:20.833 --> 03:23.300
AH. SAY IT
LIKE YOU MEAN IT.

03:23.333 --> 03:24.300
(laughs)

03:25.367 --> 03:28.167
I KNOW HOW TO HAVE A LIFE
OUTSIDE THIS HOSPITAL.

03:28.200 --> 03:29.700
DAMN RIGHT, YOU DO.

03:29.733 --> 03:31.167
(telephone rings)

03:31.200 --> 03:32.700
DR. KENT.
YES.

03:32.733 --> 03:34.633
I'M THE SURGICAL RESIDENT
ASSISTING YOU TODAY.

03:34.667 --> 03:36.567
I KNOW YOU'RE SUBBING IN
FROM MERCY WEST,

03:36.600 --> 03:38.500
SO IF THERE IS ANYTHING
I CAN DO TO HELP YOU--

03:38.533 --> 03:40.633
LOOK, I'M HERE FOR ONE DAY.
I DON'T NEED MY ASS KISSED.

03:40.667 --> 03:43.067
ALL I NEED IS TO TELL YOU
WHAT TO DO AND YOU DO IT,

03:43.100 --> 03:45.133
AND I DON'T LIKE MISTAKES.
I DON'T MAKE MISTAKES.

03:45.167 --> 03:48.133
WHATEVER. THERE'S ONLY
ONE RESIDENT I WANT IN MY O.R.

03:48.167 --> 03:49.700
THE GUY THEY CALL THE NAZI.
DO YOU KNOW HIM?

03:49.733 --> 03:51.700
THE--THE NAZI?

03:51.733 --> 03:53.633
HE GETS GREAT WORD OF MOUTH,

03:53.667 --> 03:55.367
STELLAR REP,
BALLS THE SIZE OF TEXAS.

03:55.400 --> 03:56.700
THAT BIG?

03:56.733 --> 04:00.200
SOUNDS LIKE AN IMPRESSIVELY
TALENTED MAN, THIS NAZI.

04:00.233 --> 04:02.700
DO YOU KNOW HIM OR NOT?
NEVER HEARD OF HIM.

04:02.733 --> 04:04.200
BUT I'LL BE SURE
TO KEEP AN EYE OUT.

04:04.233 --> 04:06.133
FOR NOW YOU CAN WORK
ON SMALLER CASES.

04:06.167 --> 04:08.067
A GUY JUST CAME IN
TO CURTAIN THREE.

04:08.100 --> 04:09.833
PAGE ME IF YOU GET CONFUSED.

04:09.867 --> 04:11.767
I'LL BE SURE TO DO THAT.

04:13.300 --> 04:17.533
LIKE I SAID, THE STUPIDITY
OF THE HUMAN RACE.

04:17.567 --> 04:19.067
HURRY UP, GEORGIE.

04:19.100 --> 04:21.800
THERE'S A TURKEY OUT THERE
WITH YOUR NAME ON IT, HUH?

04:21.833 --> 04:24.400
WHOA. HEY.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

04:24.433 --> 04:25.600
HEY! WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

04:25.633 --> 04:27.533
EVERY YEAR, MY FATHER,
MY BROTHERS AND I

04:27.567 --> 04:29.467
HUNT, SHOOT AND KILL
A HELPLESS, SLOW-MOVING TURKEY.

04:29.500 --> 04:31.067
ISN'T THAT GREAT?

04:31.067 --> 04:32.267
(Men) O'MALLEY!

04:32.300 --> 04:34.200
OKAY,
BUT WHAT ABOUT DINNER?

04:34.233 --> 04:36.500
UH, WE'LL HAVE HIM BACK AS SOON
AS HE KILLS HIS FIRST BIRD.

04:36.533 --> 04:38.833
THIS IS THE YEAR GEORGIE
BECOMES A MAN, RIGHT, GEORGIE?

04:38.867 --> 04:40.067
COME ON.

04:40.067 --> 04:42.700
WAIT, I CAN'T COOK DINNER
BY MYSELF! WHO'S GONNA HELP ME?

04:42.733 --> 04:44.433
WHO'S GONNA HELP ME?

04:47.367 --> 04:50.233
HOLDEN McKEE--BROUGHT IN
FROM MAYFIELD NURSING HOME.

04:50.267 --> 04:52.133
MAYFIELD?
HE'S IN THE GARDEN?

04:52.167 --> 04:53.800
GARDEN?
VEGETABLE.

04:53.833 --> 04:55.133
YEAH, HIS CHART SAYS

04:55.167 --> 04:57.067
HE FELL INTO
A PERSISTENT VEGETATIVE STATE

04:57.100 --> 04:58.533
16 YEARS AGO.

04:58.567 --> 05:00.533
HE WAS A FIREFIGHTER
INJURED BY FALLING DEBRIS

05:00.567 --> 05:02.067
IN THE LINE OF DUTY.

05:02.100 --> 05:03.833
WHAT BRINGS HIM HERE TODAY?

05:03.867 --> 05:06.067
FELL FROM HIS BED WHILE BEING
TURNED BY THE ORDERLIES.

05:06.100 --> 05:08.333
INSURANCE SAYS
HE HAS TO BE CHECKED OUT.

05:08.367 --> 05:11.300
TEMPOROPARIETAL SCALP LAC
WITH ASSOCIATED HEMATOMA.

05:11.333 --> 05:13.067
WHAT'S YOUR PLAN?

05:13.067 --> 05:15.200
IRRIGATE AND EXPLORE THE WOUND,
REPAIR THE LAC.

05:15.233 --> 05:18.100
HE'LL NEED A C.T. TO RULE OUT
INTRACEREBRAL HEMORRHAGE,

05:18.133 --> 05:19.833
CONTUSION
OR CEREBRAL EDEMA.

05:19.867 --> 05:21.800
GO TO IT.
IF ANYBODY ASKS,

05:21.833 --> 05:25.367
I'M OFF LOOKIN'
FOR THE NAZI.

05:25.400 --> 05:26.400
OKAY.

05:28.333 --> 05:30.667
IT'S JUST ME AND YOU.

05:33.500 --> 05:37.500
I'D GIVE ANYTHING
FOR YOUR KIND OF SERENITY.

05:37.533 --> 05:39.267
GREAT.

05:39.300 --> 05:42.333
NOW I'M JEALOUS
OF VEGETABLES.

05:42.367 --> 05:44.633
YOU JUST LOOK
SO PEACEFUL.

05:44.667 --> 05:46.133
AAH!

05:57.800 --> 05:59.633
DR. BAILEY.

05:59.667 --> 06:01.533
THIS GUY'S GOT THIRD-DEGREE
BURNS OVER HALF HIS BODY.

06:01.567 --> 06:03.167
TRIED TO DEEP-FRY A TURKEY.
OF COURSE, HE GOT DRUNK FIRST.

06:03.200 --> 06:04.500
IT'S GONNA BE GOOD.
YOU WANT IN?

06:04.533 --> 06:06.600
MY P.V.S. CASE--
HE OPENED HIS EYES,

06:06.633 --> 06:08.533
AND I THINK
HE WAS LOOKING AT ME.

06:08.567 --> 06:09.667
(laughter)

06:09.700 --> 06:12.633
HE WASN'T LOOKING AT YOU.

06:12.667 --> 06:15.067
NO, HE WAS.
ANYTHING GOOD?

06:15.067 --> 06:18.233
UH, NOTHING YOU WANT
TO WASTE TIME ON.

06:18.267 --> 06:21.167
THERE ARE, UH, 13 PATIENTS
THAT NEED SUTURES.

06:21.200 --> 06:24.200
SHE'S THE INTERN.
SHE CAN DO THE SUTURES.

06:24.233 --> 06:27.100
ACTUALLY, SHE'S ON HER WAY
TO C.T. WITH A V.I.P. PATIENT

06:27.133 --> 06:28.633
ON ORDERS FROM THE NAZI.

06:28.667 --> 06:30.800
TELL HIM
I'M LOOKING FOR HIM.

06:30.833 --> 06:33.567
OKAY. THE BURN UNIT
IS WAITING FOR HIM.

06:33.600 --> 06:36.500
I'LL MEET IN THE O.R.
GREY, GET A C.T.

06:36.533 --> 06:38.067
HAVE NEURO CONSULT,

06:38.067 --> 06:39.767
BUT TRUST ME,
HE WASN'T LOOKING AT YOU.

06:39.800 --> 06:41.333
(doorbell rings)

06:41.367 --> 06:43.267
DON'T MENTION SHEPHERD
OR MONTGOMERY-SHEPHERD.

06:43.300 --> 06:44.400
OKAY.

06:44.433 --> 06:46.267
OR THE FACT THAT SHEPHERD
IS WITH MONTGOMERY-SHEPHERD.

06:46.300 --> 06:47.500
OKAY.

06:47.533 --> 06:49.433
OR ANYTHING
HAVING TO DO WITH SYPHILIS.

06:49.467 --> 06:50.400
(laughs)

06:50.433 --> 06:51.767
(rings doorbell)

06:51.800 --> 06:53.700
I'VE BEEN
IN SOCIAL SITUATIONS BEFORE.

06:53.733 --> 06:55.233
YEAH, WELL, NOT WITH ME.

06:55.267 --> 06:56.600
WELL, WHY ARE WE HERE?

06:56.633 --> 06:58.133
JUST BE NICE OR SOMETHING.

06:58.167 --> 06:59.200
OKAY.

06:59.233 --> 07:01.333
IT'S HALF PAST 10.
YOU'RE LATE.

07:01.367 --> 07:03.100
I'VE HAD TO TRY TO DO
ALL THIS--

07:03.133 --> 07:05.833
OH, HI, DR. BURKE.
HELLO.

07:05.867 --> 07:07.833
OH.

07:07.867 --> 07:09.300
THANK YOU.

07:11.467 --> 07:13.367
(quietly)
WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO,

07:13.400 --> 07:15.667
BLOW OFF MY BOYFRIEND
FOR THANKSGIVING?

07:17.233 --> 07:19.100
I TRIED TO,
BUT HE WOULDN'T BLOW.

07:19.133 --> 07:21.067
HE'S LIKE SOMETHING STICKY
THAT WON'T BLOW OFF.

07:21.067 --> 07:22.800
(quietly) OKAY,
HE'S GONNA RUIN THANKSGIVING.

07:22.833 --> 07:25.367
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
TO TALK TO DR. BURKE ABOUT?

07:25.400 --> 07:28.267
PEOPLE WHO ARE SHOCKED WHEN I
SHOW UP UNINVITED TO THEIR HOMES

07:28.300 --> 07:29.633
CALL ME PRESTON.

07:29.667 --> 07:31.167
NOBODY CALLS YOU PRESTON.

07:31.200 --> 07:32.500
YOU DON'T CALL ME PRESTON.

07:32.533 --> 07:34.133
NICE HOUSE.

07:34.167 --> 07:35.500
YEAH.

07:35.533 --> 07:37.433
IZZIE, WHY IS IT
SO QUIET IN HERE?

07:37.467 --> 07:38.500
MEREDITH WENT TO THE HOSPITAL

07:38.533 --> 07:41.267
AND GEORGE IS OFF
SHOOTING THINGS WITH HIS FAMILY.

07:41.300 --> 07:43.200
SO IT'S JUST ME, YOU
(lowers voice) AND PRESTON?

07:43.233 --> 07:45.133
AND ALEX,
WHEN HE SHOWS UP.

07:45.167 --> 07:46.367
(normal voice)
OH, GREAT.

07:46.400 --> 07:48.300
HEY, ALEX, IT'S ME.
WHERE ARE YOU?

07:48.333 --> 07:49.667
OKAY, CALL ME BACK.

07:49.700 --> 07:51.733
IS SOMETHING BURNING?

07:51.767 --> 07:53.233
OH, GOD, YES!

07:53.267 --> 07:55.067
HEY, CHIEF.

07:55.067 --> 07:56.233
I'M ON MY WAY HOME.

07:56.267 --> 07:57.800
YEAH, ME TOO.

07:57.833 --> 08:00.667
I WAS SUPPOSED TO MEET ADDISON
20 MINUTES AGO.

08:00.700 --> 08:02.067
DR. SHEPHERD,
ARE YOU LEAVING?

08:02.067 --> 08:03.533
I'M ALSO GOING HOME.

08:03.567 --> 08:04.767
THEN GO HOME.

08:04.800 --> 08:07.467
ADELE'S SISTER'S IN TOWN.
I HATE THAT WOMAN.

08:07.500 --> 08:10.400
THE O.R. BOARD NEEDS
TO BE CHECKED ONE MORE TIME.

08:10.433 --> 08:12.833
IT DOES, DOESN'T IT?
EXCUSE ME.

08:12.867 --> 08:15.367
I DIDN'T THINK
YOU'D BE HERE TODAY.

08:15.400 --> 08:17.067
YEAH, WELL...

08:17.100 --> 08:19.567
I NEED A NEURO CONSULT.

08:19.600 --> 08:21.400
HOLDEN McKEE--
P.V.S. 16 YEARS.

08:21.433 --> 08:23.300
WELL, THERE'S NO BLEED,

08:23.333 --> 08:24.667
THERE'S NO MASS,
NO FRACTURE.

08:24.700 --> 08:26.200
HE--HE CAN BE DISCHARGED.

08:26.233 --> 08:28.433
WELL, HE OPENED HIS EYES

08:28.467 --> 08:30.133
WHEN I WAS EXAMINING HIM.

08:30.167 --> 08:31.500
HE OPENED HIS EYES.
YEAH, THAT'S NORMAL.

08:31.533 --> 08:34.133
CERTAIN REFLEXES
ARE PRESERVED.

08:34.167 --> 08:36.067
THERE'S AROUSAL
BUT NO AWARENESS.
BUT HE WAS LOOKING AT ME.

08:36.100 --> 08:37.833
HE WASN'T LOOKING AT YOU.
HE WAS.

08:37.867 --> 08:39.233
THIS C.T. REPORT
SAYS HE WASN'T.

08:39.267 --> 08:41.667
DO YOU WANT TO ARGUE WITH
WHAT I KNOW I SAW?

08:41.700 --> 08:44.433
NO, MEREDITH, I DON'T WANT
TO ARGUE WITH YOU ANYMORE.

08:44.467 --> 08:45.767
I GOTTA GO. I'M LATE.

08:45.800 --> 08:47.433
(sighs)

08:47.467 --> 08:49.567
HE WAS LOOKING AT YOU?

08:49.600 --> 08:52.633
(Man) '65 GTO.

08:52.667 --> 08:54.300
(Man) '57 BEL AIR--

08:54.333 --> 08:57.067
CONVERTIBLE, 2-DOOR.

08:57.100 --> 08:58.833
THE GT 500--
THAT WAS A CAR.

08:58.867 --> 09:00.767
WHAT ABOUT YOU, GEORGIE?
WHAT WOULD YOU DRIVE?

09:00.800 --> 09:02.700
GEORGIE, PICK A CAR.
COME ON.

09:02.733 --> 09:05.067
YOU DO REALIZE
THAT YOU CAN BUY A TURKEY

09:05.100 --> 09:06.667
AT THE MARKET?

09:06.700 --> 09:08.067
THEY HAVE HUNDREDS OF THEM,

09:08.067 --> 09:10.333
YOU KNOW,
ALL WRAPPED AND READY TO GO,

09:10.367 --> 09:12.267
NO AMMO REQUIRED.

09:12.300 --> 09:14.533
YOU'LL BE THE ONE TO SHOOT
THE TURKEY TODAY. I CAN FEEL IT.

09:14.567 --> 09:17.433
THAT'S THE THING,
I DON'T WANT TO SHOOT A TURKEY.

09:17.467 --> 09:19.400
YOU SAY THAT EVERY YEAR.

09:19.433 --> 09:23.333
WELL, AND EVERY YEAR,
I DON'T SHOOT THE TURKEY.

09:25.700 --> 09:27.533
WHAT IS THAT?

09:27.567 --> 09:29.133
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
MY MARINADE.

09:29.167 --> 09:30.800
ALEX, IT'S ME AGAIN.

09:30.833 --> 09:33.333
JUST WONDERING
WHERE YOU WERE AT.

09:33.367 --> 09:34.667
(hangs up phone)

09:34.700 --> 09:36.600
YOU'VE NEVER MADE
A THANKSGIVING DINNER BEFORE.

09:36.633 --> 09:38.367
YOU CAN'T COOK?

09:38.400 --> 09:39.533
IZZIE!

09:39.567 --> 09:41.067
WELL, I'M A BAKER.
I BAKE.

09:41.067 --> 09:43.267
BUT I'VE SEEN MY GRANDMOTHER
COOK A MILLION TIMES.

09:43.300 --> 09:45.100
OKAY, THAT'S IT. IF THERE'S
NO FOOD, I'M GOING HOME.

09:45.133 --> 09:46.433
CRISTINA, CRISTINA,
I HAVE THIS.

09:46.467 --> 09:48.733
WHAT ARE YOU USING
AS A REFERENCE TEXT?
"THE JOY OF COOKING."

09:48.767 --> 09:50.233
I ALSO PRINTED UP SOME RECIPES
FROM THE INTERNET,

09:50.267 --> 09:52.167
BUT THEY ALL SEEM
TO CONTRADICT ONE ANOTHER.

09:52.200 --> 09:54.733
AND I CAN'T FIGURE OUT
WHICH SIDE OF THE TURKEY

09:54.767 --> 09:57.433
IS THE TOP
AND WHICH IS THE BOTTOM.

09:57.467 --> 09:58.433
OKAY.

10:00.567 --> 10:05.367
UM, I'M GONNA NEED
A BASTING BRUSH,

10:05.400 --> 10:08.233
A BOWL, A CLOVE OF GARLIC
AND, UH,

10:08.267 --> 10:09.733
DO YOU HAVE ANY FENNEL?

10:09.767 --> 10:12.200
UM, YEAH, RIGHT HERE.

10:12.233 --> 10:13.733
GREAT.

10:13.767 --> 10:14.800
(cracks neck)

10:14.833 --> 10:15.867
(sighs) OKAY.

10:15.900 --> 10:17.567
WELL, LET'S GET THIS TURKEY
UP AND RUNNING, STEVENS.

10:17.600 --> 10:18.600
GARLIC.

10:18.633 --> 10:20.467
GARLIC.

10:20.500 --> 10:23.367
I'M GONNA NEED LIQUOR--
LOTS AND LOTS OF LIQUOR.

10:23.400 --> 10:24.567
(monitor beeps)

10:24.600 --> 10:26.600
THERE'S NO SUSTAINED
VISUAL PURSUIT.

10:26.633 --> 10:29.433
YOU KNOW, YOU MIGHT HAVE
JUST SEEN HIM RESPOND

10:29.467 --> 10:31.367
TO SOME SORT OF
EXTERNAL STIMULI.

10:31.400 --> 10:34.833
HE WASN'T LOOKING AT YOU.
I'M SORRY.

10:34.867 --> 10:38.600
I WAS SURE HE WAS. LOOK.
HE JUST DID IT AGAIN.

10:38.633 --> 10:40.667
MR. McKEE...

10:40.700 --> 10:44.467
CAN YOU FOLLOW THE LIGHT?

10:44.500 --> 10:46.733
CAN YOU HOLD UP
TWO FINGERS?

10:51.233 --> 10:54.600
OKAY, WELL, I KNOW YOU'RE
LATE FOR SOMETHING SO...

10:54.633 --> 10:55.833
KEEP TALKING.
WHAT?

10:55.867 --> 10:57.733
WALK OVER HERE.

10:57.767 --> 10:59.767
WHAT?
JUST KEEP WALKING, TALK.

10:59.800 --> 11:01.633
HOLDEN.

11:01.667 --> 11:04.333
HOLDEN.

11:04.367 --> 11:05.533
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

11:05.567 --> 11:07.600
HOLDEN.

11:07.633 --> 11:11.300
IT'S YOU. HE'S TRACKING YOU.
HE'S FOLLOWING YOUR VOICE.

11:17.633 --> 11:19.533
WELL, THAT'S WHY THERE'S
NO MENTION OF BRAIN ATROPHY

11:19.567 --> 11:21.233
IN THE C.T. REPORT.

11:21.267 --> 11:23.233
BECAUSE THERE ISN'T ANY.
NONE?

11:23.267 --> 11:25.267
HE'S BEEN P.V.S.
FOR 16 YEARS.

11:25.300 --> 11:28.133
WELL, HE'S NOT P.V.S.
HE'S MINIMALLY CONSCIOUS.

11:28.167 --> 11:31.067
HE'S MINIMALLY CONSCIOUS
AND NO ONE NOTICED?

11:31.067 --> 11:32.700
HE WAS IN A REGULAR
NURSING HOME, SO THEY JUST--

11:32.733 --> 11:34.100
MISSED IT.

11:34.133 --> 11:35.067
MM-HMM.

11:35.100 --> 11:37.667
HE'S BEEN FROZEN,
SLEEPING, FOR 16 YEARS,

11:37.700 --> 11:41.333
AND THEY MISSED IT.

11:41.367 --> 11:42.667
THAT SUCKS.

11:42.700 --> 11:45.267
THERE'S ONE THING
TO BE THANKFUL FOR.

11:45.300 --> 11:47.367
WHAT?

11:47.400 --> 11:49.533
WE MIGHT BE ABLE
TO WAKE HIM UP.

11:49.567 --> 11:51.067
Alex, it's Izzie.

11:51.100 --> 11:52.433
If you're not coming,

11:52.467 --> 11:54.367
you could at least
have the decency

11:54.400 --> 11:56.633
to call and tell me.

11:56.667 --> 11:58.167
***

11:58.200 --> 11:59.567
(George) I'M IN HELL.

11:59.600 --> 12:00.633
(Cristina)
I'm the one in hell.

12:00.667 --> 12:02.633
BURKE'S GOING ALL "IRON CHEF"
IN THE KITCHEN.

12:02.667 --> 12:05.267
GET YOUR ASS BACK HERE
AND SAVE ME.
I'm in the woods

12:05.300 --> 12:07.200
WITH SHOTGUNS AND LIQUOR
AND CAR TALK.

12:07.233 --> 12:09.100
IT'S LIKE "DELIVERANCE"
OUT HERE.
COME ON. LET'S RACE.

12:09.133 --> 12:11.133
At least you've got liquor.

12:11.167 --> 12:13.367
WHERE DOES MEREDITH
KEEP THE BOOZE?

12:13.400 --> 12:15.067
I DON'T THINK
SHE HAS ANY.

12:15.100 --> 12:16.833
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?
SHE'S A W.A.S.P.

12:16.867 --> 12:19.100
LIQUOR'S LIKE OXYGEN
TO A W.A.S.P.

12:19.133 --> 12:20.633
WHICH IS WHY
WE'RE OUT OF LIQUOR.

12:20.667 --> 12:22.567
Listen, can you come
and get me?
OKAY, HOW AM I SUPPOSED

12:22.600 --> 12:25.100
TO GET THROUGH THE HOLIDAYS
WITHOUT LIQUOR, GEORGE?

12:25.133 --> 12:27.467
JUST COME AND GET ME.

12:27.500 --> 12:29.467
HELLO? CRIS--

12:29.500 --> 12:31.633
***

12:31.667 --> 12:33.100
SELFISH!

12:33.133 --> 12:35.100
DEREK, IT'S ME.

12:35.133 --> 12:37.100
WHERE ARE YOU?

12:37.133 --> 12:40.067
***

12:42.067 --> 12:43.533
(cell phone beeps)

12:43.567 --> 12:45.567
WHICH ONE
DO YOU THINK SHE IS?

12:45.600 --> 12:46.767
HOLDEN'S WIFE?

12:46.800 --> 12:49.467
YEAH.

12:49.500 --> 12:51.067
IT'S HER.

12:52.567 --> 12:54.367
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

12:57.067 --> 12:58.167
MRS. McKEE?

12:58.200 --> 13:01.267
IT'S MRS. LEONARD NOW.

13:02.300 --> 13:04.600
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
WAKE HIM UP?

13:04.633 --> 13:07.100
OVER THE YEARS,
YOUR HUSBAND'S BRAIN

13:07.133 --> 13:09.367
HAS BEEN SLOWLY TRYING
TO HEAL ITSELF.

13:09.400 --> 13:11.600
NOW WE'VE GIVEN HIM
A COURSE OF AMPHETAMINE

13:11.633 --> 13:14.200
THAT SHOULD GIVE HIS BRAIN
THE PUSH IT NEEDS

13:14.233 --> 13:15.400
TO FIND CONSCIOUSNESS.

13:15.433 --> 13:17.333
WHEN?
HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE?

13:17.367 --> 13:19.067
IF WE'RE RIGHT,

13:19.067 --> 13:21.833
YOUR FATHER WILL BE AWAKE
IN A FEW HOURS.

13:21.867 --> 13:23.400
IS HE GONNA REALIZE
WHAT HAPPENED?

13:23.433 --> 13:25.333
MOST PATIENTS
IN THIS SITUATION

13:25.367 --> 13:27.267
HAVE NO IDEA
HOW MUCH TIME HAS PASSED.

13:27.300 --> 13:29.200
OH, MY GOD.
I'M GONNA BE SICK.

13:29.233 --> 13:31.133
I KNOW THIS IS
A DIFFICULT SITUATION.

13:31.167 --> 13:32.500
I JUST GOT MARRIED.

13:32.533 --> 13:34.433
WE'RE HAVING A BABY
IN DECEMBER.

13:34.467 --> 13:36.333
COBY TURNED 17
ON THURSDAY.

13:36.367 --> 13:38.367
DIFFICULT?

13:38.400 --> 13:40.333
THIS IS UNIMAGINABLE.

13:40.367 --> 13:41.533
MRS. LEONARD,
PERHAPS YOU SHOULD--

13:41.567 --> 13:43.467
I CAN'T BE HERE
WHEN HE WAKES UP.

13:43.500 --> 13:46.067
HE CAN'T SEE ME LIKE THIS
OR COBY.

13:46.067 --> 13:47.400
COBY, BABY, WE'RE LEAVING.

13:47.433 --> 13:48.767
WE'LL BE IN THE CAR.

13:48.800 --> 13:50.300
MRS. LEONARD--

13:50.333 --> 13:52.167
HOLDEN IS GOING TO WAKE UP

13:52.200 --> 13:54.667
AND FIND OUT
THAT WE DIDN'T WAIT FOR HIM.

13:55.700 --> 13:57.800
IT TOOK HER A LONG TIME
TO MOVE ON.

14:00.400 --> 14:02.500
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
UP HERE?

14:02.533 --> 14:05.167
GET DOWN TO THE PIT.
WE'RE BACKED UP.

14:05.200 --> 14:08.700
NO CAN DO, SIR. THE NAZI
HAS ME ON THIS SURGERY.

14:08.733 --> 14:10.633
WE'VE GOT A LINE
OUT THE DOOR FOR SUTURES.

14:10.667 --> 14:11.933
EVERYBODY'S AN AMATEUR CHEF

14:11.967 --> 14:14.733
UNTIL THEY GET
A KNIFE IN THEIR HANDS.
KNIVES CAN BE TRICKY.

14:14.767 --> 14:16.433
(monitor beeping)

14:16.467 --> 14:20.067
YOUR WIFE KNOW
YOU'RE WORKING TODAY?

14:20.100 --> 14:21.433
I'M GOING HOME.

14:21.467 --> 14:23.367
I JUST WANTED TO WATCH
A LITTLE BIT.

14:23.400 --> 14:25.267
DON'T STAY HERE
TOO LONG.

14:25.300 --> 14:27.200
YOU COULD END UP
LIKE HIM.

14:27.233 --> 14:28.567
WIFE STABBED HIM.

14:28.600 --> 14:31.100
SAID SHE DIDN'T LIKE THE WAY
HE WAS CARVING THE TURKEY.

14:31.133 --> 14:32.400
OUCH.

14:32.433 --> 14:34.633
(doorbell rings)

14:34.667 --> 14:37.267
HAPPY THANKSGIVING.
JOE, THANK GOD.

14:37.300 --> 14:40.133
HEY, THIS IS MY BOYFRIEND
WALTER.

14:40.167 --> 14:41.667
WHATEVER.
TELL ME YOU BROUGHT LIQUOR.

14:41.700 --> 14:43.500
I BROUGHT PIE.
PUMPKIN.

14:43.533 --> 14:45.667
YOU'RE A BARTENDER.

14:45.700 --> 14:48.167
DID YOU BRING SCALPELS?

14:50.533 --> 14:53.433
(imitating turkey call)

14:54.867 --> 14:56.233
COME ON. PICK A CAR.

14:56.267 --> 14:58.167
I DON'T WANT
TO PICK A CAR.

14:58.200 --> 14:59.733
HE DOESN'T KNOW JACK
ABOUT CARS.

14:59.767 --> 15:01.533
I KNOW PLENTY.
I JUST DON'T WANT TO PICK ONE.

15:01.567 --> 15:02.733
GEORGIE'S JUST TIRED.

15:02.767 --> 15:04.533
THEY WORKIN' YOU TOO HARD
AT THE HOSPITAL?

15:04.567 --> 15:06.600
YOU KNOW HE WORKS
48-HOUR SHIFTS?

15:06.633 --> 15:09.467
48 HOURS,
AND YOU ENJOY IT?
YEAH, I ENJOY IT.

15:09.500 --> 15:11.133
LIKE, WHAT DO YOU DO?

15:11.167 --> 15:12.333
YOU KNOW, MEDICAL STUFF.

15:12.367 --> 15:14.067
COME ON.

15:14.067 --> 15:16.067
THEY'RE NOT GONNA GET IT.
MAKE YOUR BROTHERS JEALOUS.

15:16.067 --> 15:18.100
TELL 'EM WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO BE A BIG-TIME SURGEON.

15:18.133 --> 15:20.067
COME ON.

15:21.067 --> 15:23.700
OKAY, LAST NIGHT,
THIS WAS PRETTY COOL,

15:23.733 --> 15:26.067
I ASSISTED
ON A TRUNCAL VAGOTOMY,

15:26.100 --> 15:27.833
AND WE INFLATED THIS--
ASSISTED?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

15:27.867 --> 15:29.533
I HELPED THE SURGEON.

15:29.567 --> 15:31.467
ANYWAY, WE INFLATED
THIS GUY'S ABDOMEN

15:31.500 --> 15:33.367
WITH A CARBON--
WAIT, I THOUGHT
YOU WERE THE SURGEON.

15:33.400 --> 15:35.200
I'M A SURGICAL INTERN.

15:35.233 --> 15:38.067
THE RESIDENT OR THE ATTENDING,
THEY PERFORM THE SURGERY.

15:38.067 --> 15:39.800
OH, SO YOU DON'T ACTUALLY
CUT ANYBODY OPEN?

15:39.833 --> 15:42.067
I MEAN, BY YOURSELF.

15:42.067 --> 15:43.767
NO, LIKE, THE POINT
OF BEING AN INTERN

15:43.800 --> 15:45.300
IS THAT YOU'RE LEARNING.

15:45.333 --> 15:46.667
WE WATCH THE SURGERIES

15:46.700 --> 15:48.600
AND THE ATTENDING
ASKS US QUESTIONS

15:48.633 --> 15:50.533
AND WE HAVE TO ANSWER THEM.
IT'S NOT EASY.

15:50.567 --> 15:53.367
I HAVE TO BE ON TOP OF MY GAME
100% OF THE TIME.

15:53.400 --> 15:54.567
IT'S INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT.

15:54.600 --> 15:59.267
SO YOU DON'T ACTUALLY
DO ANYTHING?

15:59.300 --> 16:01.333
YES, I DO.
YOU JUST
STAND THERE.

16:01.367 --> 16:03.667
NO, I--
AND WATCH
THE REAL DOCTORS WORK.

16:03.700 --> 16:05.067
I AM A REAL DOCTOR.

16:05.067 --> 16:06.800
NO, YOU'RE NOT. YOU SAID
YOU JUST STAND THERE.

16:06.833 --> 16:08.500
YOU SAID
YOU DON'T DO ANYTHING.

16:08.533 --> 16:10.067
NO, I DIDN'T--NO, YOU SAID
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

16:10.067 --> 16:11.533
REAL DOCTORS
SAVE LIVES, GEORGIE.

16:11.567 --> 16:14.300
I MEAN, IF YOU'RE JUST
STANDING THERE--
OH, FOR GOD--

16:14.333 --> 16:16.767
WHAT?

16:16.800 --> 16:18.300
(imitating turkey call)

16:18.333 --> 16:21.133
I WANT TO GO HOME.

16:21.167 --> 16:23.800
JUST AS SOON
AS YOU SHOOT YOUR TURKEY.

16:23.833 --> 16:26.700
(monitor beeping)

16:26.733 --> 16:28.333
(knocks on wall)

16:28.367 --> 16:29.700
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

16:29.733 --> 16:31.633
WAITING FOR MY PATIENT
TO WAKE UP.

16:31.667 --> 16:33.567
WHY AREN'T YOU
AT THE THANKSGIVING?

16:33.600 --> 16:35.633
WHY AREN'T YOU
AT THANKSGIVING?

16:35.667 --> 16:38.567
***

16:41.367 --> 16:43.433
OHH.

16:48.100 --> 16:50.067
WHAT?

16:50.067 --> 16:53.067
I TELL YOU SOMETHING,
YOU TELL ME SOMETHING.

16:53.100 --> 16:56.067
***

16:58.400 --> 17:00.100
OKAY.

17:00.133 --> 17:02.067
I FEEL LIKE
ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE

17:02.067 --> 17:03.400
WHO'S SO FREAKIN' MISERABLE

17:03.433 --> 17:06.267
THEY CAN'T BE AROUND
NORMAL PEOPLE...

17:06.300 --> 17:09.200
LIKE I'LL INFECT
THE HAPPY PEOPLE...

17:09.233 --> 17:12.267
LIKE I'M SOME MISERABLE,
DISEASED,

17:12.300 --> 17:16.167
DIRTY EX-MISTRESS.

17:16.200 --> 17:18.100
YOUR TURN.

17:19.833 --> 17:22.467
I FAILED THE MEDICAL BOARDS.

17:22.500 --> 17:24.400
IF I TELL IZZIE,
SHE'LL BE NICE ABOUT IT,

17:24.433 --> 17:26.433
ALL SUPPORTIVE
AND OPTIMISTIC.

17:26.467 --> 17:29.267
SHE MIGHT AS WELL
RIP MY NADS OFF

17:29.300 --> 17:31.200
AND TURN 'EM INTO EARRINGS.

17:31.233 --> 17:34.133
ALEX, YOU SHOULD GO
TO THANKSGIVING.

17:34.167 --> 17:37.067
I MEAN, DON'T TELL HER
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO.

17:37.067 --> 17:38.833
BUT YOU SHOULD GO.

17:38.867 --> 17:41.733
OTHERWISE,
YOU'RE JUST...

17:41.767 --> 17:43.600
ME.

17:43.633 --> 17:46.667
A MISERABLE, DISEASED,
DIRTY EX-MISTRESS.

17:46.700 --> 17:48.367
(whistles)

17:48.400 --> 17:50.533
THAT'S HOT.
THAT'S REALLY HOT.

17:50.567 --> 17:52.200
I FEEL BETTER ALREADY.

17:52.233 --> 17:54.233
SEE?

17:54.267 --> 17:57.400
OH.
HAPPY THANKSGIVING.

17:58.500 --> 18:01.400
***

18:06.567 --> 18:08.300
HELLO?

18:08.333 --> 18:10.467
IS SOMEBODY THERE?

18:10.500 --> 18:13.333
(monitor beeping)

18:13.367 --> 18:15.100
OHH.

18:15.133 --> 18:16.400
SOMEBODY...

18:16.433 --> 18:18.267
YES.

18:18.300 --> 18:20.267
SOMEBODY'S HERE.

18:24.333 --> 18:26.233
MR. McKEE, YOUR MUSCLES
HAVE SUFFERED DETERIORATION

18:26.267 --> 18:27.367
AND YOUR JOINTS
WILL BE PAINFUL FOR AWHILE,

18:27.400 --> 18:29.267
WHICH IS TO BE EXPECTED.

18:29.300 --> 18:31.533
NOW THE FACT THAT YOUR
COMMUNICATION SKILLS

18:31.567 --> 18:33.200
ARE STILL INTACT
IS REMARKABLE.

18:33.233 --> 18:36.133
DID YOU
REACH MY WIFE YET?

18:36.167 --> 18:38.067
IS SHE COMING?

18:38.100 --> 18:40.100
I MEAN,
HAVE YOU TOLD HER

18:40.133 --> 18:44.400
OR DO YOU WAIT
UNTIL SHE GETS HERE?

18:44.433 --> 18:46.433
BECAUSE THIS IS GONNA...

18:46.467 --> 18:48.533
QUITE A SHOCK.

18:48.567 --> 18:51.133
HOW LONG
HAVE I BEEN OUT?

18:53.300 --> 18:54.800
WHAT, A YEAR?

18:54.833 --> 18:57.333
WOULD YOU EXCUSE US?

18:57.367 --> 18:59.800
NO, YOU TELL ME,
PLEASE.

18:59.833 --> 19:02.667
YOU FOUND ME.

19:02.700 --> 19:04.833
YOU TELL ME.

19:04.867 --> 19:06.533
I'M ONLY AN INTERN.

19:06.567 --> 19:08.300
I'VE NEVER REALLY
DONE THIS BEFORE.

19:08.333 --> 19:10.367
ME EITHER.

19:10.400 --> 19:14.133
YOU'LL DO IT QUICKLY.

19:14.167 --> 19:17.267
RIP OFF THE BANDAGE.

19:17.300 --> 19:20.067
NO ANESTHESIA.

19:20.100 --> 19:22.667
EXACTLY.

19:22.700 --> 19:23.800
MM-HMM.

19:23.833 --> 19:27.067
I'LL BE RIGHT OUTSIDE
IF YOU NEED ME.

19:37.100 --> 19:38.400
TRUTH TIME.

19:40.867 --> 19:43.200
TRUTH TIME.

19:46.733 --> 19:48.700
(cries)

19:48.733 --> 19:51.233
(Burke) MMM.

19:51.267 --> 19:54.133
YOU HAVE TO CUT THE CELERY
INTO FINER PIECES, STEVENS.

19:54.167 --> 19:56.067
(laughs) LIKE THAT?

19:56.100 --> 19:59.067
IT'LL DO. PUT THEM IN
WITH THE ONIONS.

20:00.567 --> 20:02.800
NOW WHAT SHOULD YOU
BE CONCERNED ABOUT?

20:02.833 --> 20:04.233
UM...

20:04.267 --> 20:05.767
THE TURKEY, STEVENS.

20:05.800 --> 20:07.133
I'D EXPECT YOU
TO KNOW THAT.

20:07.167 --> 20:08.700
RIGHT. I NEED TO
CHECK THE TURKEY

20:08.733 --> 20:11.400
TO MAKE SURE IT'S COOKING
AT THE CORRECT TEMPERATURE.

20:11.433 --> 20:13.333
YEAH, AND HOW
DO WE DO THAT?

20:13.367 --> 20:15.667
MEAT THERMOMETER.
10 BUCKS SAYS
SHE DRIES OUT THE TURKEY.

20:15.700 --> 20:17.600
20 SAYS
SHE PULLS IT OFF.

20:17.633 --> 20:19.200
75 SAYS I DON'T CARE.

20:19.233 --> 20:22.300
OOH, OKAY, STEVENS.
LET'S SEE WHAT YOU CAN DO.

20:25.200 --> 20:27.333
MORE PRESSURE. TURKEY HAS
A TOUGH SHELL. DIG IN.

20:27.367 --> 20:29.100
I'M IN.

20:29.133 --> 20:30.467
DAMN, SHE GOT IT IN.

20:30.500 --> 20:32.367
TOLD YOU SHE'S GONNA
PULL IT OFF.

20:32.400 --> 20:33.733
NOT BAD. NOW ALL YOU
HAVE TO DO NOW

20:33.767 --> 20:35.533
IS STICK THE THERMOMETER
DEEP ENOUGH IN THE BIRD

20:35.567 --> 20:37.433
TO GET A TEMP,
BUT BE CAREFUL NOT TO--
OH!

20:37.467 --> 20:38.667
YOU HIT THE BONE.

20:38.700 --> 20:41.267
THE PAN IS FILLING WITH JUICE
AND YOU'RE LOSING MOISTURE.

20:41.300 --> 20:42.567
WHAT DO YOU DO?

20:42.600 --> 20:44.800
UM...
THINK.

20:44.833 --> 20:47.367
THAT'S IT.
I'M OUT OF HERE.

20:47.400 --> 20:49.067
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

20:49.100 --> 20:50.267
YOU'RE OPERATING
ON A TURKEY.

20:50.300 --> 20:53.167
AND--AND YOU'RE
MAKING FRIENDS

20:53.200 --> 20:55.033
WITH MY FRIENDS.

20:55.067 --> 20:57.400
YOU TOLD ME TO BE NICE.

20:57.433 --> 20:59.333
YOU KNOW, BE NICE.

20:59.367 --> 21:01.500
YOU KNOW, I'M JUST GONNA GO
TO THE STORE

21:01.533 --> 21:03.200
AND GET SOME LIQUOR.

21:03.233 --> 21:06.067
GIVE ME THE KEYS, PLEASE.

21:06.067 --> 21:08.233
I'LL--I'LL BE BACK.

21:11.133 --> 21:12.833
(door closes)
(Izzie) DR. BURKE!

21:12.867 --> 21:15.633
SUCTION. USE THE BASTER
AND SUCTION.

21:15.667 --> 21:18.433
THE GT 500
WAS A SHELBY.

21:18.467 --> 21:20.600
HE ALSO MADE THE VIPER.
YOU KNOW THAT?

21:20.633 --> 21:21.633
YES, WE DO KNOW.

21:21.667 --> 21:23.567
(Man) THE SHELBY 500
IS A GOOD CAR.

21:23.600 --> 21:25.300
YEAH.

21:25.333 --> 21:26.667
AND THE OTHER CAR HE MADE--
(turkey chirps)

21:26.700 --> 21:28.067
TURKEY.

21:28.100 --> 21:29.533
OOH.

21:29.567 --> 21:31.333
TURKEY. TURKEY.

21:31.367 --> 21:32.833
JERRY...

21:32.867 --> 21:35.733
WE CAME OUT HERE
SO I COULD SHOOT A TURKEY.

21:35.767 --> 21:38.633
DAD SAID WE'RE NOT LEAVING
UNTIL I SHOOT A TURKEY.

21:38.667 --> 21:41.800
I AM SHOOTING THIS TURKEY.

21:43.400 --> 21:45.667
(whispers) WHEN YOU'RE SURE
YOU'VE GOT IT,

21:45.700 --> 21:47.400
SQUEEZE.

21:47.433 --> 21:49.333
(quietly) NO FAIR.
I CALLED TURKEY.

21:49.367 --> 21:51.267
(quietly) DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
HE'S NOT GONNA DO IT.

21:51.300 --> 21:54.133
HE'S GONNA CHICKEN OUT
AND THEN YOU CAN--
YAHOO!

21:54.167 --> 21:55.667
HE GOT IT.
I GOT IT?

21:55.700 --> 21:57.100
YOU GOT IT, GEORGIE!

21:57.133 --> 21:59.067
LET'S GO HOME!

21:59.100 --> 22:01.700
WHAT'S HE LIKE?

22:01.733 --> 22:03.400
M-MY SON.

22:03.433 --> 22:07.067
YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T REALLY
GET A CHANCE TO SPEAK WITH HIM.

22:07.067 --> 22:09.267
BUT HE SEEMED NICE.

22:09.300 --> 22:10.700
HE'S, UH, TALL, LIKE YOU.

22:10.733 --> 22:12.633
AND HE'S GOT YOUR EYES.

22:12.667 --> 22:15.067
THAT...

22:15.100 --> 22:17.400
THAT'S GOOD.

22:20.267 --> 22:22.167
HOLDEN, WE'RE READY
TO BEGIN.

22:22.200 --> 22:24.100
WHAT DOES THE M.R.I. DO?

22:24.133 --> 22:27.533
JUST GIVES US A BETTER PICTURE
OF YOUR BRAIN, REALLY.

22:27.567 --> 22:29.500
YOU'RE ONE FOR THE BOOKS,
YOU KNOW?

22:29.533 --> 22:31.333
THAT'S NICE.

22:31.367 --> 22:34.233
(typing)

22:35.367 --> 22:37.067
HOW'S HE DOIN'?

22:37.067 --> 22:39.300
AS WELL AS WE COULD EXPECT.

22:49.567 --> 22:51.067
DAMN IT.

22:51.067 --> 22:53.533
(Derek)
AN EPIDURAL HEMATOMA.

22:53.567 --> 22:55.467
WHEN YOU FELL
OUT OF BED THIS MORNING,

22:55.500 --> 22:57.300
YOU HIT YOUR TEMPLE, HARD.

22:57.333 --> 23:00.200
THE C.T. DIDN'T CATCH IT,
BUT THE M.R.I. DID.

23:00.233 --> 23:02.267
AND YOU CAN FIX IT?

23:02.300 --> 23:03.733
IT WON'T BE EASY.

23:03.767 --> 23:06.067
SOMETIMES, IT'S IMPOSSIBLE
TO FIND THE VESSEL

23:06.100 --> 23:07.833
AND COMPLICATIONS
CAN ARISE,

23:07.867 --> 23:10.067
BUT, YES, I CAN OPERATE.

23:10.100 --> 23:11.800
SO THERE IS A RISK?

23:11.833 --> 23:14.300
A VERY LARGE RISK, YES.

23:14.333 --> 23:16.400
AND WHAT HAPPENS
IF YOU DON'T OPERATE?

23:16.433 --> 23:19.300
THE BEST-CASE SCENARIO IS THAT
THE BLEEDING RESOLVES ITSELF.

23:19.333 --> 23:21.300
OR IT COULD CONTINUE
TO BLEED

23:21.333 --> 23:23.467
AND CAUSE THE BRAIN
TO SWELL.

23:23.500 --> 23:25.100
WHICH MEANS WHAT?

23:25.133 --> 23:26.467
MOST LIKELY,

23:26.500 --> 23:29.333
WITHOUT THE OPERATION,
YOU'LL DIE.

23:29.367 --> 23:32.300
BUT THE OPERATION
COULD KILL ME, TOO, RIGHT?

23:32.333 --> 23:34.667
THEY'RE EQUAL RISKS
BOTH WAYS.

23:36.867 --> 23:40.533
WHAT DO I... DO?

23:43.433 --> 23:46.133
WHAT WOULD YOU DO?

23:46.167 --> 23:48.233
I CAN'T ANSWER THIS
FOR YOU.

23:54.233 --> 23:57.100
CAN I HAVE THAT SPATULA,
PLEASE?

23:57.133 --> 23:59.067
YEAH.

23:59.067 --> 24:00.233
THANK YOU.

24:00.267 --> 24:01.667
MM-HMM.

24:03.200 --> 24:06.167
YOU WANT THAT BUTTER TO MELT,
NOT TO BOIL.

24:07.733 --> 24:10.600
DR. BURKE, HOW DID YOU
LEARN TO COOK LIKE THIS?

24:10.633 --> 24:13.267
MY MOTHER OWNS A RESTAURANT
IN ALABAMA.

24:13.300 --> 24:14.233
SERIOUSLY?

24:14.267 --> 24:16.133
SERIOUSLY.

24:16.167 --> 24:18.333
DOES CRISTINA KNOW THAT?

24:18.367 --> 24:21.167
NO. ACTUALLY, SHE DOESN'T.

24:21.200 --> 24:23.633
SHE DOESN'T ASK A LOT
OF PERSONAL QUESTIONS.

24:23.667 --> 24:25.567
SHE'S KIND OF HARD
TO GET TO KNOW.

24:25.600 --> 24:28.667
YES, SHE IS.

24:31.333 --> 24:33.233
KAREV DIDN'T SHOW.

24:33.267 --> 24:35.333
NO, HE DIDN'T.

24:35.367 --> 24:38.267
IS THAT OKAY?

24:38.300 --> 24:41.367
NO, IT'S NOT.

24:41.400 --> 24:43.300
DO YOU KNOW THAT THERE'S
ABSOLUTELY NO LIQUOR

24:43.333 --> 24:44.367
IN THIS HOUSE?

24:44.400 --> 24:46.300
OH, YEAH. CRISTINA WENT
TO GET SOME.

24:46.333 --> 24:49.067
OVER AN HOUR AGO.
WHERE IS SHE?

24:49.100 --> 24:50.600
LEVI JOHNSON.

24:50.633 --> 24:51.800
SWALLOWED A WISHBONE?

24:51.833 --> 24:53.500
(muffled) YES.

24:53.533 --> 24:55.433
EXCELLENT. WE'LL HAVE TO
TAKE SOME FILMS.

24:55.467 --> 24:57.367
MAYBE YOU RUPTURED
YOUR ESOPHAGUS, HUH?

24:57.400 --> 24:58.567
THAT MEANS SURGERY.

24:58.600 --> 24:59.700
(coughs)

24:59.733 --> 25:01.800
CAR'S LOADED.
GUYS, COOLERS, COME ON.

25:01.833 --> 25:03.733
GET UP, GET UP, GET UP.

25:03.767 --> 25:05.267
COME ON.

25:05.300 --> 25:08.067
DAD, COME ON.

25:08.100 --> 25:09.733
HOLD ON, GEORGIE.

25:09.767 --> 25:11.267
WE GOTTA BLOOD YOU.

25:11.300 --> 25:13.167
OH...

25:13.200 --> 25:14.700
NO.

25:14.733 --> 25:16.367
NOW THERE YOU GO.

25:16.400 --> 25:18.333
NOW YOU'RE OFFICIALLY

25:18.367 --> 25:20.300
AN O'MALLEY MAN.

25:20.333 --> 25:21.300
(Both) O'MALLEY!

25:21.333 --> 25:23.200
THANK YOU.

25:23.233 --> 25:25.233
I LEFT MY HAT.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

25:25.267 --> 25:26.433
(Both) O'MALLEY!

25:26.467 --> 25:29.733
GUYS, GET--
JUST GET IN THE CAR.

25:29.767 --> 25:31.067
O'MALLEY!
O'MALLEY!

25:31.100 --> 25:32.600
21-GUN SALUTE
FOR GEORGIE.

25:32.633 --> 25:34.533
OKAY, THAT'S NOT
THE BEST IDEA, GUYS.

25:34.567 --> 25:36.567
I'M SERIOUS.
OW!

25:36.600 --> 25:39.433
YOU SHOT DAD IN THE ASS!

25:39.467 --> 25:42.400
ARE YOU HAPPY NOW?!

25:48.433 --> 25:52.100
GUYS, THIS IS THE TRAUMA ROOM.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

25:52.133 --> 25:53.300
PUT IT DOWN.

25:55.533 --> 25:57.633
DAD, I'M GONNA
INJECT YOU WITH SOMETHING

25:57.667 --> 25:58.833
TO NUMB THE AREA.

25:58.867 --> 26:00.767
I-I'M FINE.
I DON'T NEED ANYTHING.

26:00.800 --> 26:02.533
IT DOESN'T EVEN HURT
THAT BAD.

26:02.567 --> 26:05.600
DAD, YOU HAVE BIRD SHOT EMBEDDED
IN YOUR GLUTEUS MAXIMUS.

26:05.633 --> 26:08.200
WHEN I START REMOVING IT,
BELIEVE ME, IT'S GONNA HURT

26:08.233 --> 26:10.400
VERY BAD.
HEY, '65 GTO.

26:10.433 --> 26:11.500
(snort)

26:11.533 --> 26:14.100
THAT'S A V-8 TWEAKER.
YOU DON'T WANT THAT.

26:14.133 --> 26:15.667
WHAT YOU WANT
IS THE BEL AIR.

26:15.700 --> 26:18.067
BUT IT'S GOTTA BE
THE 2-TONE, RIGHT?
NICE.

26:18.100 --> 26:19.833
AH, PICK A CAR, GEORGIE.

26:19.867 --> 26:21.533
NO, THANKS.

26:21.567 --> 26:23.067
COME ON, GEORGIE.
PICK A CAR.

26:23.100 --> 26:24.833
I TOLD YOU HE DOESN'T KNOW
JACK ABOUT CARS.

26:24.867 --> 26:26.533
HE DOESN'T KNOW JACK
ABOUT JACK.

26:26.567 --> 26:28.167
JERRY...

26:28.200 --> 26:30.400
FIRST YOU SAY THE GTO,
RONNY COUNTERS WITH THE BEL AIR,

26:30.433 --> 26:34.100
WHICH NEVER FAILS TO MAKE DAD
SAY THE GT 500.

26:34.133 --> 26:36.367
THE COBRA, THE CHIEFTAIN,
THEN SOMEONE NAMES A GERMAN CAR,

26:36.400 --> 26:37.767
WHICH INVARIABLY STARTS

26:37.800 --> 26:39.733
THE AMERICAN
VERSUS FOREIGN DEBATE

26:39.767 --> 26:41.800
THAT USUALLY ENDS WHEN ONE
OF YOU BRINGS UP THE DeVILLE,

26:41.833 --> 26:43.067
AND THAT ALWAYS, ALWAYS

26:43.067 --> 26:45.533
LEADS TO THE UNBELIEVABLY
LONG DISCUSSION ON THE MERITS

26:45.567 --> 26:47.467
OF THE '57 THUNDERBIRD.

26:47.500 --> 26:49.400
SO HOW ABOUT
I JUST JUMP TO THE END

26:49.433 --> 26:50.767
AND NAME THE THUNDERBIRD NOW

26:50.800 --> 26:53.667
SO THAT ONCE IN OUR LIVES,
WE CAN STOP PICKING CARS?!

26:53.700 --> 26:55.267
AND MY NAME IS GEORGE!

27:00.133 --> 27:02.567
WHAT DO YOU KNOW?
THE KID CAME BACK.

27:02.600 --> 27:04.067
NO, HE DIDN'T.

27:10.833 --> 27:13.733
HE SAYS WE HAVE
THE SAME EYES.

27:13.767 --> 27:15.400
YEAH.

27:15.433 --> 27:18.233
I DON'T SEE IT.

27:28.267 --> 27:31.433
HE SAID
THAT HE COULDN'T STAY

27:31.467 --> 27:34.333
BECAUSE OF THE HOLIDAY.

27:34.367 --> 27:38.433
BUT HE--HE SAID
HE'LL COME BACK SOMETIME SOON.

27:38.467 --> 27:40.367
GOOD.

27:42.600 --> 27:45.333
HE SAID SHE'S HAPPY.

27:45.367 --> 27:47.800
UH, THAT THIS GUY HAL

27:47.833 --> 27:51.200
IS, UH, REALLY GOOD FOR HER.

27:51.233 --> 27:54.067
SHE LOVES HIM.

27:56.400 --> 28:01.433
SO I'VE DECIDED TO, UH,
GO AHEAD WITH THE SURGERY.

28:01.467 --> 28:05.067
YOU KNOW, THEY'VE MOVED ON.

28:05.100 --> 28:06.267
I SHOULD, TOO.

28:06.300 --> 28:10.733
YOU KNOW, GET THIS THING...
OUT OF MY HEAD

28:10.767 --> 28:15.767
AND GET ON WITH MY LIFE.

28:17.767 --> 28:20.233
RIGHT.

28:20.267 --> 28:24.233
I'LL, UH,
TELL DR. SHEPHERD.

28:24.267 --> 28:26.367
OKAY.

28:26.400 --> 28:27.600
DR. GREY.

28:27.633 --> 28:29.333
YEAH.

28:32.100 --> 28:35.500
DO YOU THINK
HE REALLY WILL COME BACK?

28:35.533 --> 28:39.067
I HOPE SO.

28:40.367 --> 28:43.233
JOE AND WALTER HAVE GOT
THE TABLE SET UP

28:43.267 --> 28:44.500
IN THE LIVING ROOM.
HOW'S OUR BIRD?

28:44.533 --> 28:46.767
HE NEEDS A FEW MORE HOURS.

28:50.200 --> 28:52.100
WHY DID YOU PLAN
THIS BIG DINNER

28:52.133 --> 28:54.067
IF YOU KNEW
YOU COULDN'T COOK?

28:54.067 --> 28:56.067
I JUST LIKE THANKSGIVING,
DR. BURKE.

28:56.100 --> 28:57.167
PRESTON.

28:57.200 --> 28:58.667
PRESTON.

28:58.700 --> 29:01.233
YOU JUST LIKE THANKSGIVING?

29:04.600 --> 29:07.433
WE WORK 18 HOURS A DAY,
6 DAYS A WEEK,

29:07.467 --> 29:09.500
50 WEEKS A YEAR.

29:09.533 --> 29:13.267
WE DON'T REALLY HAVE
ANY TIME FOR OUR FAMILIES.

29:13.300 --> 29:15.200
WE DON'T HAVE FRIENDS
THAT AREN'T DOCTORS.

29:15.233 --> 29:18.100
BUT WE HAVE THIS ONE DAY,

29:18.133 --> 29:20.767
ONE DAY WHERE WE GET TO BE
LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE.

29:20.800 --> 29:23.667
ONE DAY TO BE NORMAL.

29:23.700 --> 29:25.667
A DAY WHERE...

29:25.700 --> 29:31.300
NOBODY LIVES AND NOBODY DIES
ON OUR WATCH.

29:31.333 --> 29:33.300
IT'S LIKE A GIFT.

29:33.333 --> 29:36.300
SO I JUST THOUGHT
WE SHOULD APPRECIATE IT.

29:36.333 --> 29:37.800
THAT'S ALL.

29:37.833 --> 29:39.400
I GOTTA SET THE TABLE.

29:39.433 --> 29:42.333
***

29:48.533 --> 29:50.567
A DAY WITHOUT SURGERY.

29:50.600 --> 29:53.400

A WISHBONE WHOLE?

29:53.433 --> 29:55.467
(drops wishbone in tray)

29:55.500 --> 29:59.133
DR. BAILEY, WHY ARE YOU
WORKING ON THANKSGIVING?

29:59.167 --> 30:03.233
YOU WORK THE EXTRA SHIFTS
AND GET THE EXTRA PRACTICE.

30:03.267 --> 30:06.667
AND I'M TRYING TO GET IN
ALL THE PRACTICE I CAN...

30:08.667 --> 30:09.800
BEFORE THE BABY COMES

30:09.833 --> 30:13.733
AND I HAVE TO TAKE TIME OFF.

30:13.767 --> 30:16.800
MY HUSBAND ISN'T THRILLED
I'M WORKING THANKSGIVING,

30:16.833 --> 30:19.667
BUT HE ISN'T A SURGEON.

30:19.700 --> 30:21.600
SO HE DOESN'T GET IT.

30:21.633 --> 30:24.233
OH.

30:26.133 --> 30:29.300
YOU AND DR. BURKE?

30:29.333 --> 30:31.033
YES.

30:31.067 --> 30:34.033
***

30:35.567 --> 30:38.467
HE WOULD'VE MADE
A GOOD FATHER.

30:41.367 --> 30:44.267
***

30:55.567 --> 30:57.533
HEY.

30:59.600 --> 31:00.767
YOU COMING?

31:00.800 --> 31:02.767
NOT ENOUGH INTERNS.
I GOTTA COVER THE FLOOR.

31:02.800 --> 31:05.600
***

31:05.633 --> 31:07.533
WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE DONE
IF YOU WERE HIM?

31:07.567 --> 31:10.067
WOULD YOU HAVE THE SURGERY?

31:10.067 --> 31:12.700
YOU WOULD HAVE THE SURGERY.

31:12.733 --> 31:14.233
I WOULD WANT THE FUTURE.

31:14.267 --> 31:15.733
OR TO BE ASLEEP AGAIN.

31:15.767 --> 31:17.633
ONE OR THE OTHER.

31:17.667 --> 31:19.467
NOTHING IN BETWEEN.

31:19.500 --> 31:22.467
I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW
WHAT I WOULD WANT.

31:22.500 --> 31:26.133
I KNOW YOU DON'T.

31:26.167 --> 31:27.533
OKAY.

31:27.567 --> 31:31.333
IF YOU GET A CHANCE,
YOU CAN SCRUB IN LATER.

31:31.367 --> 31:33.267
I'LL PROBABLY
BE AT THIS AWHILE.

31:33.300 --> 31:36.733
***

31:39.867 --> 31:41.767
I THOUGHT
YOU'D FORGOTTEN ABOUT ME.

31:41.800 --> 31:42.733
NO.

31:42.767 --> 31:44.433
WHERE ARE
RONNY AND JERRY?

31:44.467 --> 31:47.767
THE NURSE TOLD THEM
THAT THE CAFETERIA WAS OPEN.

31:47.800 --> 31:49.533
OH.

31:55.500 --> 31:57.167
YOU DIDN'T
HAVE FUN TODAY.

31:57.200 --> 31:59.767
IT'S NOT THAT.

32:01.100 --> 32:03.433
NO.

32:03.467 --> 32:05.800
NO, I DIDN'T HAVE FUN.

32:08.333 --> 32:09.733
YOU HURT
YOUR BROTHERS' FEELINGS.

32:09.767 --> 32:11.433
DAD--
YOU DID.

32:11.467 --> 32:14.333
THEY TALK TO ME
LIKE I'M STUPID.

32:14.367 --> 32:16.267
THEY CALL ME "GEORGIE."

32:16.300 --> 32:18.333
THEY'VE NEVER TREATED ME
LIKE I'M ONE OF THEM.

32:18.367 --> 32:20.767
GEORGE, JERRY IS DRY CLEANER.

32:20.800 --> 32:23.800
RONNY WORKS
IN THE POST OFFICE.

32:23.833 --> 32:25.467
I DRIVE A TRUCK.

32:25.500 --> 32:27.700
YOU'RE A SURGEON.
YOU'RE NOT ONE OF US.

32:27.733 --> 32:30.267
I KNOW IT AND THEY KNOW IT.

32:30.300 --> 32:33.533
AND YOU MAKE SURE
WE KNOW IT.

32:33.567 --> 32:34.300
DAD--

32:34.333 --> 32:36.400
I'M NOT--
I'M NOT BLAMING YOU.

32:36.433 --> 32:38.467
IT MAKES ME PROUD
YOU'RE SO SMART,

32:38.500 --> 32:41.767
LIKE I DID SOMETHING RIGHT.

32:44.233 --> 32:47.200
IT'S JUST...

32:47.233 --> 32:49.600
WE TRY.

32:49.633 --> 32:51.833
WE TRY TO INCLUDE YOU,

32:51.867 --> 32:54.467
BUT YOU DON'T LIKE
THE STUFF THAT WE LIKE.

32:54.500 --> 32:57.367
AND WE DON'T KNOW
HOW TO TALK ABOUT THE STUFF

32:57.400 --> 32:58.567
YOU WANNA TALK ABOUT.

32:58.600 --> 33:00.267
YOU'RE NOT ONE OF US.

33:00.300 --> 33:03.500
BUT, DAMN IT, WE DON'T TREAT YOU
LIKE YOU'RE STUPID.

33:03.533 --> 33:05.800
YOU TREAT US
LIKE WE'RE STUPID.

33:05.833 --> 33:08.300
AND MAYBE WE ARE,

33:08.333 --> 33:11.500
BUT WE'RE YOUR FAMILY.

33:11.533 --> 33:14.600
GIVE US AN INCH, GEORGIE.

35:08.567 --> 35:10.100
IT'S ONE OF OUR BUSIEST DAYS
OF THE YEAR.

BIRD MURDER

DO YOU WANT TO BUY ME
A DRINK?

40:40.067 --> 40:41.767

40:41.800 --> 40:45.400
IS REASON ENOUGH TO CELEBRATE.

40:45.433 --> 40:47.400
