01:56.200 --> 01:58.050
- A virulent
new strain of influenza

01:58.100 --> 02:00.320
is overtaking societies across the globe.

02:00.370 --> 02:02.250
It exhibits very unusual symptoms,

02:02.300 --> 02:04.710
the likes of which have
not before been seen.

02:04.760 --> 02:06.790
All continents and countries are infected.

02:06.840 --> 02:08.270
Each taking their own precautions

02:08.320 --> 02:11.170
to try to curb the rate of
infection in their cities.

02:11.220 --> 02:14.360
More dense populations are
affected but do not be fooled.

02:14.410 --> 02:16.931
This is spreading quickly and widely.

02:51.489 --> 02:53.900
Doctors are urging that the
safest thing for everyone to do

02:53.950 --> 02:55.680
for themselves and their loved ones

02:55.730 --> 02:58.210
is to stay inside and isolate.

02:58.260 --> 03:00.100
This is a highly infectious virus

03:00.150 --> 03:02.080
and is spreading quicker than the W.H.O.

03:02.130 --> 03:04.520
is able to provide updates
and recommendations.

03:04.570 --> 03:08.186
If you absolutely need to go
out, please wear your full PPE.

03:08.236 --> 03:10.953
There is just no other way
to avoid this contagion.

03:47.718 --> 03:49.120
- Camping La tuque?

03:49.170 --> 03:51.140
- Hello, I'm the new
buyer's representative.

03:51.190 --> 03:53.304
I'm supposed to come visit
the property today but I--

03:59.822 --> 04:00.655
- Beep!

04:23.106 --> 04:24.610
- How's it going?

04:24.660 --> 04:25.500
- The buyer's rep called

04:25.550 --> 04:27.690
and was lost and asking for directions.

04:27.740 --> 04:28.679
- What'd you tell her?

04:29.662 --> 04:30.445
- I didn't.

04:30.495 --> 04:31.800
I pretended I was the voicemail.

04:33.110 --> 04:34.520
- You do know they'll still show up.

04:34.570 --> 04:37.170
- Yeah but I don't have
to make it easy for them.

04:37.220 --> 04:40.450
- Well, don't be disappointed
when your plan doesn't work.

04:40.500 --> 04:41.700
It's a pretty done deal.

04:42.830 --> 04:44.500
Your uncle asked me to be there for them.

04:44.550 --> 04:47.080
He also asked me to make sure you're okay.

04:47.130 --> 04:49.228
- This really sucks.

04:49.278 --> 04:51.360
- You know Stan tested
positive for the virus, eh?

04:51.410 --> 04:53.124
- He told me.

04:53.174 --> 04:54.480
- How about dinner later?

04:54.530 --> 04:55.530
- Yeah, sounds good.

05:33.430 --> 05:35.410
Hey, whoa, what the hell?

05:35.460 --> 05:37.660
Didn't you read the
sign, the camp's closed!

05:41.110 --> 05:42.170
- I'm Vanessa Murdoch.

05:42.220 --> 05:43.160
- So?

05:43.210 --> 05:44.860
- I'm here to visit the property.

05:50.900 --> 05:52.720
I'm Aaron Prince's attorney.

05:52.770 --> 05:54.570
We called ahead to say I was coming.

05:55.430 --> 05:57.420
- Sorry, nobody contacted me about this

05:57.470 --> 05:59.473
and I'm under orders not to let anyone in.

06:04.054 --> 06:05.804
- What's the problem?

06:10.530 --> 06:12.870
- Aaron Prince is coming to
visit the property tomorrow.

06:12.920 --> 06:13.740
He asked me to come ahead

06:13.790 --> 06:16.877
to make sure everything was in order.

06:25.080 --> 06:26.300
- Let her through.

06:26.350 --> 06:27.133
- Why are you letting her in?

06:27.183 --> 06:28.873
- I don't have a choice.

06:29.720 --> 06:31.020
The bank has taken charge.

06:32.512 --> 06:34.312
Don't worry, I'll take care of this.

06:37.400 --> 06:38.233
- Thank you.

06:49.870 --> 06:51.070
- Be at my trailer.

06:51.120 --> 06:51.953
- Cool.

06:54.440 --> 06:56.129
- Where am I going?

07:02.750 --> 07:03.960
- If you're going to be
spending some time here,

07:04.010 --> 07:05.830
there's some rules you need to follow.

07:05.880 --> 07:06.973
Like the speed limit.

07:09.326 --> 07:11.990
- I thought you said the camp was closed.

07:12.040 --> 07:13.190
- That's not the point.

07:14.610 --> 07:15.443
- Right.

07:17.840 --> 07:20.290
Look, you're obviously not happy I'm here.

07:20.340 --> 07:21.840
But I'm just here to do a job.

07:24.480 --> 07:26.230
Mr. Prince is expecting
everything to be ready

07:26.280 --> 07:27.530
for his arrival tomorrow.

07:30.200 --> 07:32.173
Would be nice to have your cooperation.

07:36.960 --> 07:37.793
- Follow me.

07:55.891 --> 07:57.474
- I'm okay, thanks.

08:35.660 --> 08:37.943
I'd like to have the plans
and documents for the camp.

08:43.990 --> 08:44.823
Please.

08:45.924 --> 08:47.660
- The documents are in the office.

08:47.710 --> 08:49.010
- Is everything organized?

08:50.950 --> 08:53.070
I'll meet you in the office in 15 minutes.

09:07.042 --> 09:07.875
I'm...

09:12.267 --> 09:15.890
I'm not finding the fire
prevention plan for this site.

09:15.940 --> 09:17.100
- These are the papers I was able to get

09:17.150 --> 09:19.560
on such a short notice.

09:19.610 --> 09:22.340
- Doesn't the camp have
an environmental plan?

09:22.390 --> 09:23.350
What about a sewage system

09:23.400 --> 09:24.440
or water navigation plan?
- Look,

09:24.490 --> 09:25.860
I don't know who you think you are.

09:25.910 --> 09:28.470
This is a private camp
ground, not a provincial park.

09:28.520 --> 09:29.660
If that's what you're looking for,

09:29.710 --> 09:31.030
Parc La Mauricie is about an hour away

09:31.080 --> 09:33.663
and I'm sure they'll have
everything you're looking for.

09:34.760 --> 09:35.760
Let me show you out.

09:40.550 --> 09:41.890
Look, I have things to do, so if you want,

09:41.940 --> 09:43.280
you can take the papers
back to your trailer

09:43.330 --> 09:44.850
and look at them there.

09:44.900 --> 09:46.480
- Yeah, go ahead, I'll
be here when you're done.

09:46.530 --> 09:48.580
- I cannot leave this place unsupervised.

09:50.450 --> 09:51.840
- I'm not gonna take anything.

09:51.890 --> 09:53.783
- Your boss doesn't own
the camp ground yet.

10:12.662 --> 10:13.762
What's she doing here?

10:15.160 --> 10:16.810
- We apparently have to feed her.

10:18.050 --> 10:19.490
What do you drink?

10:19.540 --> 10:20.323
Beer, wine?

10:20.373 --> 10:22.090
- I'll have whatever you're having.

10:22.940 --> 10:23.773
- Whiskey.

10:24.610 --> 10:25.443
- Yeah.

10:26.330 --> 10:28.890
- Well, this looks like fun.

10:28.940 --> 10:32.773
So I'll go get dinner ready
while you guys do this.

10:42.580 --> 10:43.980
- Is he always this hostile?

10:44.840 --> 10:45.673
- Julian?

10:46.850 --> 10:48.440
He grew up here.

10:48.490 --> 10:49.340
This is his home.

10:50.670 --> 10:53.830
He's feeling a little
displaced at the moment.

10:53.880 --> 10:55.320
His uncle didn't tell him about the sale

10:55.370 --> 10:56.423
until a few days ago.

11:01.560 --> 11:04.543
- I did have a few questions
in regards to the camp.

11:06.660 --> 11:07.500
Mainly--

11:07.550 --> 11:10.180
- Just let me finish off
the rest of this chapter.

11:10.230 --> 11:12.770
I'll answer all your questions.

11:12.820 --> 11:15.056
- Thank you.

11:15.106 --> 11:17.273
- Dinner's ready.

11:28.860 --> 11:31.160
- I didn't realize how hungry I was.

11:31.210 --> 11:32.510
- I'm glad you enjoyed it.

11:34.660 --> 11:35.493
Right, Julian?

11:39.080 --> 11:40.910
- Thank you, it was delicious.

11:40.960 --> 11:42.853
I had never had moose burgers before.

11:44.899 --> 11:45.732
- We hunted it.

11:47.117 --> 11:48.117
- Do you hunt often?

11:49.450 --> 11:50.233
- Last fall.

11:50.283 --> 11:51.277
That's the last time.

11:52.280 --> 11:53.063
- Yeah.

11:53.113 --> 11:55.080
Guess not much hunting during a pandemic.

11:56.187 --> 11:57.577
- Yep.

12:03.192 --> 12:04.854
You cold?

12:04.904 --> 12:05.865
- Yeah.

12:05.915 --> 12:06.720
- Julian,

12:06.770 --> 12:08.483
go inside, get Vanessa a blanket.

12:17.550 --> 12:18.800
- What's your book about?

12:20.010 --> 12:22.510
- How'd you know I was writing a book?

12:22.560 --> 12:24.450
- You said you were finishing a chapter.

12:24.500 --> 12:26.000
I assumed you had a full book.

12:27.875 --> 12:30.175
- It's about the frailty
of our infrastructure

12:31.270 --> 12:33.620
and how we're one disaster
away from crumbling.

12:35.630 --> 12:37.180
Look at the senior's residence.

12:38.170 --> 12:39.193
80 percent died.

12:42.520 --> 12:44.813
- Clay teaches at Concordia
when he's not writing.

12:47.000 --> 12:47.833
- Thank you.

12:49.753 --> 12:51.880
What do you teach?

12:51.930 --> 12:53.953
- Political Science, Indigenous studies.

12:57.720 --> 12:59.700
- I'd love to hear some Indigenous stories

12:59.750 --> 13:01.063
if you'd like to share.

13:08.760 --> 13:09.593
- Okay.

13:11.883 --> 13:15.310
A few years back, I was hired
to lead a hunting expedition

13:15.360 --> 13:16.910
with some Americans from Omaha.

13:18.360 --> 13:19.143
On their last night,

13:19.193 --> 13:22.350
they decided they were gonna
stay up drinking all night.

13:22.400 --> 13:24.193
I was tired, so I just went to bed.

13:26.120 --> 13:29.400
The next morning, I couldn't find them.

13:31.230 --> 13:33.780
All their stuff was still
there but they were gone.

13:35.459 --> 13:38.573
I figured they must've gotten lost.

13:40.130 --> 13:41.230
So I called the police

13:42.143 --> 13:43.293
to send a search party.

13:44.920 --> 13:47.913
Two days of searching, not a trace.

13:49.051 --> 13:51.623
On the third day, we found something.

13:53.540 --> 13:54.373
- What?

13:55.450 --> 13:56.382
- Bones.

13:57.960 --> 13:59.663
Fresh, bloody,

14:00.720 --> 14:01.623
meaty bones.

14:03.450 --> 14:04.850
Like nothing I've ever seen.

14:06.500 --> 14:08.603
- But what were they?

14:10.210 --> 14:11.043
- Human remains.

14:14.960 --> 14:16.510
- Bullshit.

14:16.560 --> 14:18.753
- Not kidding you.

14:18.803 --> 14:20.803
They were spread out all over the place.

14:22.150 --> 14:25.493
It was like they were gnawed to death.

14:26.920 --> 14:27.753
- Wolves?

14:29.660 --> 14:30.610
- I don't think so.

14:31.910 --> 14:33.087
A little further in the woods

14:33.137 --> 14:35.543
was some clothing hanging
from some branches.

14:36.615 --> 14:39.165
I recognized one of the
shirts from my Omaha group.

14:41.200 --> 14:43.500
Now this is where the
story gets really weird.

14:44.650 --> 14:45.440
People started saying

14:45.490 --> 14:48.080
they saw something strange in the woods.

14:48.130 --> 14:49.973
Some said it walked on four legs.

14:51.030 --> 14:52.480
Others said it walked on two.

14:54.199 --> 14:57.090
But they all said that this creature

14:58.320 --> 15:01.070
had bright shining eyes that
looked right through them.

15:03.020 --> 15:06.870
I didn't see it but I knew
right away what it was.

15:06.920 --> 15:07.753
- What?

15:11.600 --> 15:13.200
- Are you sure you want to know?

15:18.836 --> 15:19.669
- Yeah.

15:21.270 --> 15:22.520
- In the Algonquin tribe,

15:23.372 --> 15:24.822
that's the tribe I belong to,

15:26.200 --> 15:27.910
there's an old urban
legend about a creature

15:27.960 --> 15:29.090
that roams these woods

15:30.750 --> 15:31.700
called the Wendigo.

15:33.600 --> 15:36.480
Wasn't the first time
someone's gone missing.

15:36.530 --> 15:38.420
But hasn't happened in a long time.

15:40.140 --> 15:41.327
- What's a Wendigo?

15:44.094 --> 15:46.927
- Wendigo is said to be part human

15:49.135 --> 15:50.882
and part evil spirit.

15:52.487 --> 15:54.223
It invokes acts of murder,

15:56.120 --> 15:56.953
cannibalism

15:58.920 --> 16:00.501
and insatiable greed.

16:05.060 --> 16:06.310
From everyone description

16:08.050 --> 16:09.850
and from the remains I saw that day,

16:11.670 --> 16:13.520
there's no doubt in my mind

16:13.570 --> 16:16.120
it was the Wendigo that
did this to those poor men.

16:19.430 --> 16:21.880
- Don't listen to him,
it's just a made up story.

16:23.810 --> 16:25.080
- I'm not kidding you.

16:25.130 --> 16:26.630
Ask Stan about it.

16:30.010 --> 16:32.300
Go to the town's archives,

16:32.350 --> 16:34.167
find some newspaper clippings.

16:46.470 --> 16:47.643
I'll see you in the morning?

16:49.800 --> 16:51.713
Don't go walking in those woods alone.

16:55.960 --> 16:57.110
Going to town tomorrow?

16:58.000 --> 16:59.250
- Yeah, I could.

17:24.920 --> 17:25.753
- Julian!

17:28.530 --> 17:29.743
This box is a bit heavy.

17:30.760 --> 17:32.210
- Lay her down, I'll take it.

17:33.540 --> 17:34.550
Oh.

17:34.600 --> 17:35.763
You want a ride too?

17:37.663 --> 17:38.800
- You know what, nevermind.

17:38.850 --> 17:40.413
- All right, suit yourself.

17:41.260 --> 17:42.093
- Asshole.

17:45.933 --> 17:46.720
- Come on.

17:46.770 --> 17:47.553
- It's okay.

17:47.603 --> 17:48.460
- Look, I'm sorry.

17:48.510 --> 17:50.263
I was being a jerk.

17:50.313 --> 17:51.146
Just get on.

18:00.017 --> 18:00.860
And don't think I'm being nice.

18:00.910 --> 18:04.330
I just don't want anything
to happen to the document.

18:04.380 --> 18:05.918
- Right.

18:09.440 --> 18:11.702
That story Clay told was
pretty creepy, right?

18:12.880 --> 18:14.283
- He's full of crap.

18:17.450 --> 18:19.770
- Didn't realize how dark it would get.

18:19.820 --> 18:21.207
- Yeah well, usually
have light coming from

18:21.257 --> 18:23.750
the camp fires and the lamp posts.

18:23.800 --> 18:24.800
Actually kinda nice.

18:29.030 --> 18:31.620
- I know you're upset about
the sale but I promise,

18:31.670 --> 18:35.110
the new buyer, he really wants
to keep everything the same.

18:35.160 --> 18:39.073
He has a sentimental
attachment to this place.

19:01.680 --> 19:04.330
- If you need anything, I'm
just a few trailers down.

19:06.280 --> 19:07.113
- Okay.

19:17.520 --> 19:20.580
- And if you have any questions
regarding the documents,

19:20.630 --> 19:21.480
just let me know.

19:22.660 --> 19:23.493
- Thanks.

19:24.369 --> 19:25.202
Goodnight.

19:26.462 --> 19:31.462
- Goodnight.

20:06.545 --> 20:09.611
Fuck!

20:09.661 --> 20:11.661
Worthless piece of crap!

20:17.290 --> 20:19.070
- I'm heading to town.

20:19.120 --> 20:20.440
- Pickup won't start.

20:20.490 --> 20:22.221
- I can give you a ride.

20:22.271 --> 20:23.104
- Yeah?

20:25.840 --> 20:26.673
- Actually,

20:28.120 --> 20:30.047
since you know where you're going.

20:31.417 --> 20:33.245
You drive.

20:33.295 --> 20:38.295
♪ "Not Like you" by Sandra Bouza ♪

20:53.205 --> 20:56.393
- You go out the city often?

20:56.443 --> 20:57.666
- Not recently.

20:57.716 --> 20:58.837
- No?

20:58.887 --> 21:00.030
- I used to do quite a bit of traveling

21:00.080 --> 21:01.959
with my family when I was younger but--

21:02.009 --> 21:03.676
- Oh, nice.

21:05.708 --> 21:07.880
Yeah, I don't do a whole lot of traveling.

21:07.930 --> 21:09.797
Spend most of my summers here.

21:09.847 --> 21:11.409
Well, all my summers.

21:19.010 --> 21:20.010
- The
Provincial government

21:20.060 --> 21:22.210
is on the verge of adopting martial law

21:22.260 --> 21:25.030
after hundreds of young
people have become infected.

21:25.080 --> 21:27.710
They feel it's the only way
to control its population

21:27.760 --> 21:29.760
due to the pandemic deniers.

21:29.810 --> 21:31.590
As was stated earlier this week,

21:31.640 --> 21:33.620
the federal government
has allowed each province

21:33.670 --> 21:36.111
to govern the handling of
their own jurisdiction.

21:52.699 --> 21:53.482
- Oh.

23:10.797 --> 23:11.710
- It's the first time

23:11.760 --> 23:13.820
that martial law will be put into effect

23:13.870 --> 23:15.760
as the population will be mandated

23:15.810 --> 23:19.163
to be inside their residences
with a seven o'clock curfew.

23:22.850 --> 23:24.983
- Do you think this will
affect your client's plans?

23:25.970 --> 23:26.943
- I hope not.

23:29.240 --> 23:30.883
- See that paper mill over there?

23:31.950 --> 23:33.470
You can see it from the camp.

23:33.520 --> 23:34.835
- Yeah, I can smell it too.

23:36.980 --> 23:38.490
It really is that close?

23:38.540 --> 23:40.040
- Yeah, like a 20 minute walk.

23:50.490 --> 23:51.323
I know that car.

23:53.050 --> 23:54.356
Can we stop?

23:57.170 --> 23:59.503
That's Mario Paquette's car.

24:08.140 --> 24:10.117
- I don't see anyone around.

24:47.809 --> 24:48.642
- Okay.

24:54.071 --> 24:57.655
He said to go back to the
camp and he'll send someone.

25:17.050 --> 25:17.883
Hey.

25:19.590 --> 25:20.590
Thanks for the ride.

25:25.160 --> 25:26.260
That was crazy, right?

25:28.107 --> 25:30.080
- I hope your friend's okay.

25:30.130 --> 25:31.550
- Yeah.

25:31.600 --> 25:32.433
Yeah.

25:35.820 --> 25:37.960
- Aaron should be here soon.

25:38.010 --> 25:40.067
- What time's he supposed to be coming at?

25:41.120 --> 25:41.953
- Noon?

25:47.470 --> 25:49.540
- I should've probably
mentioned this sooner

25:49.590 --> 25:51.843
but Aaron is a bit more
than just my client.

25:56.330 --> 25:57.163
He's here.

26:01.230 --> 26:02.442
- He's flying?

26:54.577 --> 26:55.674
- How was the car ride?

26:55.724 --> 26:56.507
- Loved it.

26:56.557 --> 26:58.670
I'm actually really
glad you guys are here.

26:58.720 --> 27:00.783
I was starting to get worried.

27:00.833 --> 27:02.370
- And there go the lovebirds.

27:02.420 --> 27:04.423
- All he did the entire
time was talk about you.

27:09.245 --> 27:11.633
- That's a bit exaggerated.

27:11.683 --> 27:13.042
- You missed me?

27:13.092 --> 27:14.222
- I did.

27:14.272 --> 27:15.105
Come here.

27:16.097 --> 27:17.847
- Get a fucking room!

27:19.985 --> 27:21.150
- How was the flight?

27:21.200 --> 27:24.390
- Too bad you weren't in
the copter with us, Vanessa.

27:24.440 --> 27:25.223
- Maybe I could've been

27:25.273 --> 27:27.380
if it wasn't for all
that luggage of yours.

27:27.430 --> 27:28.540
- She's amazing, right?

27:28.590 --> 27:31.299
- Yeah, this place is huge.

27:31.349 --> 27:32.647
- What are you wearing?

27:32.697 --> 27:34.135
- What're you wearing?

27:34.185 --> 27:34.968
- Excuse me.

27:35.018 --> 27:37.756
- I would maybe
change my shoes if I were you.

27:38.750 --> 27:40.053
- Let's get settled in.

27:40.920 --> 27:42.490
- Hey!

27:42.540 --> 27:43.910
What happened?

27:43.960 --> 27:46.230
You told us we were headed
to the promise land.

27:46.280 --> 27:49.460
We're in a fucking New Jersey
tire fire of a trailer park.

27:49.510 --> 27:50.590
- Nate, come on.

27:50.640 --> 27:51.960
- Oh yeah, you
have eyes, don't you?

27:52.010 --> 27:52.793
Use them.

27:52.843 --> 27:54.863
- Who's taking care of my bags?

27:56.110 --> 27:56.943
- Hey!

28:03.070 --> 28:03.903
Go on.

28:05.363 --> 28:07.590
You do a good job with
those, and oh my god,

28:07.640 --> 28:10.490
there is more of that
where that came from.

28:12.200 --> 28:13.370
- Don't touch it.

28:13.420 --> 28:16.283
You are gonna get grease all over them.

28:16.333 --> 28:18.100
Vanessa, help me.

28:18.150 --> 28:19.410
- What do you want me to do?

28:19.460 --> 28:21.423
- You were supposed to organize it.

28:23.606 --> 28:25.123
- Okay.

28:47.257 --> 28:49.007
- Where is the hotel?

28:50.350 --> 28:52.500
- You do know this is
a camp ground, right?

28:53.390 --> 28:55.410
- Aaron, I can't stay here.

28:55.460 --> 28:56.470
- What's the problem?

28:56.520 --> 28:59.360
- Where am I supposed to take a shower?

28:59.410 --> 29:01.160
- There's a shower in your trailer.

29:02.400 --> 29:04.060
- I told you we were going camping.

29:04.110 --> 29:06.250
You're the one who insisted
you still wanted to come.

29:06.300 --> 29:09.433
- Yeah, but I thought you said glamping.

29:11.174 --> 29:12.007
Ugh.

29:19.010 --> 29:21.450
- Welcome to the glamping experience.

29:21.500 --> 29:23.033
- Here.
- Not you!

29:27.940 --> 29:29.273
Are their bugs?

29:30.400 --> 29:32.548
- Don't worry, there's bug
repellent in your closet.

29:42.920 --> 29:43.753
- Hey.

29:44.980 --> 29:46.350
What's on the menu tonight?

29:46.400 --> 29:47.880
- I'm not the chef.

29:47.930 --> 29:49.660
- Stan assured me there
would be staff on site

29:49.710 --> 29:50.660
to take care of us.

29:58.620 --> 29:59.700
- Aaron's the smooth talker.

29:59.750 --> 30:02.050
He thinks seduction's the way to do it.

30:02.100 --> 30:03.750
I'm more of a "here's your money,

30:05.347 --> 30:07.003
"let's fuck" kind of guy.

30:08.950 --> 30:10.703
Daddy hungry and we wanna eat.

30:17.920 --> 30:19.842
- Can you drive faster?

30:26.612 --> 30:27.500
- Clay,

30:27.550 --> 30:30.293
this is Aaron Prince and his friend, Max.

30:31.390 --> 30:32.223
Clay Walker.

30:34.120 --> 30:35.420
- I pass on the handshake.

30:39.723 --> 30:42.540
I met your father several years ago.

30:42.590 --> 30:44.040
I'm familiar with his company

30:45.030 --> 30:46.730
and his business practices.

30:46.780 --> 30:47.963
- I'm not my father.

30:52.250 --> 30:53.083
Look,

30:54.080 --> 30:56.533
my family comes down here
fishing every summer.

30:57.473 --> 30:59.190
- Lake Wayagamac.

30:59.240 --> 31:01.900
- Look, last time we were down,
I saw the camp was for sale.

31:01.950 --> 31:03.630
- What does your father
think about all this?

31:03.680 --> 31:05.630
- I am not my dad.

31:05.680 --> 31:07.233
This is my project.

31:13.360 --> 31:14.840
- Okay.

31:14.890 --> 31:15.723
Well,

31:16.870 --> 31:20.080
Stan and I bought this
property some 20 years ago.

31:20.130 --> 31:22.393
It is said we are standing
on hallowed ground.

31:24.490 --> 31:25.960
Things kind of gotten out of our control

31:26.010 --> 31:26.890
over the past couple of weeks.

31:26.940 --> 31:28.890
We got a little behind on the mortgage.

31:30.130 --> 31:31.630
That's neither here nor there.

31:33.750 --> 31:35.480
You're here to make certain

31:35.530 --> 31:38.630
this land stays in the
same pristine condition.

31:38.680 --> 31:40.130
That is the agreement, right?

31:42.364 --> 31:45.072
My perspective's changed over
the past couple of weeks.

31:48.710 --> 31:49.493
- Where's Stanton?

31:49.543 --> 31:50.780
I thought he was gonna be here.

31:50.830 --> 31:51.613
- Stanton?

31:51.663 --> 31:53.390
He's not coming.

31:53.440 --> 31:54.590
I'm taking care of you.

31:55.580 --> 31:57.480
- He should've called me to
tell me he wasn't gonna be here.

31:57.530 --> 31:58.570
I would've delayed my trip.

31:58.620 --> 32:00.247
- No you wouldn't.

32:00.297 --> 32:02.380
Why, because it's your project.

32:02.430 --> 32:05.457
You're keen for it to go ahead, right?

32:05.507 --> 32:06.470
It's a perfect time too.

32:06.520 --> 32:08.820
Everyone's all busy with the pandemic.

32:08.870 --> 32:10.383
No one's watching too closely.

32:14.960 --> 32:17.500
Now if you don't mind, I gotta
get back to what I was doing.

32:17.550 --> 32:19.563
Julian, show them around.

32:20.839 --> 32:22.189
If they have any questions,

32:23.212 --> 32:24.650
I'll be around.

32:31.080 --> 32:33.837
- This is where the graphite is?

32:36.294 --> 32:39.667
- Let's just get this over
with, it's fucking raining.

32:41.958 --> 32:42.741
What?

32:42.791 --> 32:43.830
There's nobody around, don't worry.

32:43.880 --> 32:45.460
- That native guy.

32:45.510 --> 32:46.300
He knows.

32:46.350 --> 32:47.183
- Walker?

32:48.130 --> 32:50.463
He's just fucking with our
heads, he knows nothing.

32:51.350 --> 32:53.690
- You heard what he said, we're
standing on hallowed ground.

32:53.740 --> 32:56.320
Nothing good comes from
fucking with that kind of shit.

32:56.370 --> 32:58.480
- Look, either he sells it to me

32:58.530 --> 33:00.220
or the bank forecloses on his mortgage

33:00.270 --> 33:02.530
and he loses everything, okay?

33:02.580 --> 33:04.280
I'm giving him a great deal.

33:04.330 --> 33:06.650
He's lucky to get it from me.

33:06.700 --> 33:08.530
- I wouldn't get so cocky.

33:08.580 --> 33:10.410
If anyone finds out what
you're planning to do,

33:10.460 --> 33:13.430
they'll ask for an
injunction to stop the sale.

33:13.480 --> 33:14.850
- That's not gonna happen, okay?

33:14.900 --> 33:16.557
They're not gonna fund out.

33:35.880 --> 33:37.650
- A new
curfew has been put into place.

33:37.700 --> 33:39.020
In this new state of emergency,

33:39.070 --> 33:40.363
everyone is obliged to be
indoors as of sundown--

33:40.413 --> 33:42.343
- Glad you like some shots.

33:43.950 --> 33:45.195
- Yeah, I would.

33:45.245 --> 33:47.189
- The military
will be sent out and try--

33:47.239 --> 33:50.070
- I was listening to that.

33:50.120 --> 33:51.563
- I am on vacation.

33:53.230 --> 33:55.163
- I could also use some help.

33:58.276 --> 33:59.128
I meant you.

34:00.730 --> 34:05.560
- My followers are expecting
news of my camping experience.

34:05.610 --> 34:08.790
- Yes, you mean your glamping experience.

34:08.840 --> 34:11.000
- Whatever, Vanessa.

34:11.050 --> 34:15.293
What doesn't kill me
just makes me stronger.

34:15.343 --> 34:17.810
Hashtag, leave me alone.

34:17.860 --> 34:18.693
- I am!

34:32.070 --> 34:33.150
- All right.

34:33.200 --> 34:35.601
- So I got a call back from the lab.

34:37.370 --> 34:38.490
Once the samples get to them,

34:38.540 --> 34:40.990
we should get the results
within three days.

34:41.040 --> 34:42.270
- Where's she going?

34:42.320 --> 34:43.260
- Aaron.

34:43.310 --> 34:44.700
- Yeah, oh.

34:44.750 --> 34:46.360
Perfect, good.

34:46.410 --> 34:49.453
Once the bank gets the go-ahead,
we'll draw up the papers.

34:50.360 --> 34:51.143
- Good.

34:51.193 --> 34:52.510
If the initial research proves right,

34:52.560 --> 34:54.880
there should be graphite
right underneath us.

34:54.930 --> 34:56.253
- Brought you a drink.

34:58.500 --> 35:01.290
- Why does she keep talking
to this fucking guy?

35:01.340 --> 35:02.350
- You know how she is.

35:02.400 --> 35:05.100
She's probably just
making sure we're good.

35:05.150 --> 35:07.010
- Yeah, I just don't like him.

35:07.060 --> 35:09.890
- Well, he doesn't seem to
like us very much either.

35:09.940 --> 35:11.090
- He's a bit of a tool.

35:12.040 --> 35:13.530
- Looks amazing, can I help?

35:13.580 --> 35:14.483
- No, it's fine.

35:15.760 --> 35:17.243
Shouldn't you be with your friends?

35:21.050 --> 35:22.680
- I know all of this was thrown upon you

35:22.730 --> 35:25.753
but you don't have to go
with everything they say.

35:26.636 --> 35:27.419
- And that's coming from you?

35:27.469 --> 35:28.302
Okay.

35:30.410 --> 35:32.110
- What is that supposed to mean?

35:32.160 --> 35:34.863
- You're working just as
hard as me, if not, harder.

35:37.050 --> 35:38.350
Why didn't you fly in with them?

35:38.400 --> 35:39.830
- Someone had to drive the car.

35:39.880 --> 35:42.150
- Isn't that an assistant's job?

35:42.200 --> 35:43.180
They made you load the car with luggage,

35:43.230 --> 35:44.900
you're making them drinks, he's
making you do whatever else

35:44.950 --> 35:46.020
and for what?

35:46.070 --> 35:47.023
A fancy car?

35:48.030 --> 35:49.110
Hope it's worth is, Vanessa.

35:49.160 --> 35:51.080
- He's not making me do anything.

35:51.130 --> 35:53.480
You obviously know nothing
about relationships.

35:55.150 --> 35:56.230
I love him.

35:56.280 --> 35:57.580
- Okay, whatever.

36:02.905 --> 36:03.900
- Why are you being such a jerk?

36:03.950 --> 36:05.380
I thought we were good now.

36:05.430 --> 36:06.213
- Why didn't you tell me

36:06.263 --> 36:07.480
that the possible new
buyer is your boyfriend?

36:07.530 --> 36:09.290
- I wasn't hiding anything.

36:09.340 --> 36:11.930
It's just absolutely
none of your business.

36:11.980 --> 36:13.465
And besides, what did you
think was gonna happen?

36:13.515 --> 36:15.615
I was gonna be another notch on your belt?

36:19.858 --> 36:21.310
- Anyway,

36:21.360 --> 36:23.167
you can go back and let him
know you checked up on me

36:23.217 --> 36:24.363
and I'm doing my job.

36:30.170 --> 36:32.030
- This property means everything to Aaron.

36:32.080 --> 36:33.380
He's gonna do something great with it

36:33.430 --> 36:35.340
and I'm just here to help him do that.

36:37.450 --> 36:39.200
- It's already great the way it is.

37:07.657 --> 37:09.350
- Tonight, we die together, my friend.

37:09.400 --> 37:10.703
- All right.
- All right, let's go.

37:13.431 --> 37:14.214
- Nope.

37:14.264 --> 37:15.097
Good.

37:22.275 --> 37:23.108
- Don't.

37:34.964 --> 37:35.747
- Oh, here we go.

37:35.797 --> 37:36.580
Yeah, thank you.

37:36.630 --> 37:38.008
You can put that anywhere in the middle.

37:38.058 --> 37:39.808
- Smells delicious.

37:39.858 --> 37:41.114
I'm so hungry.

37:41.164 --> 37:42.675
- Fucking hot potato.

37:42.725 --> 37:43.552
- Bizarre.

37:47.710 --> 37:48.939
- A toast.

37:48.989 --> 37:53.000
- Oh, that is what
I'm talking about, old chap!

37:53.050 --> 37:55.821
- A toast to new
ventures and friendship.

37:55.871 --> 37:57.709
- And, of course, belligerence!

38:24.296 --> 38:25.079
- Woo!

38:25.129 --> 38:26.060
- The pool.

38:26.110 --> 38:28.077
My father caught you

38:28.127 --> 38:30.515
and after he was thinking like...

38:30.565 --> 38:32.180
- He punched
me in the balls, yeah.

38:32.230 --> 38:34.390
- Doesn't make sense.
- Andrea?

38:34.440 --> 38:35.900
Could I have my boyfriend back?

38:35.950 --> 38:39.560
- Ah, Vanessa, there
is nothing to envy here.

38:39.610 --> 38:41.358
Aaron's like a brother to me.

38:42.830 --> 38:46.300
Except that night we made
out in Rio, remember?

38:46.350 --> 38:48.180
- We were 16.

38:48.230 --> 38:50.420
- Wow, what a crazy night.

38:50.470 --> 38:53.120
We were just trying to anger our dads

38:53.170 --> 38:55.160
but they were so pleased.

38:55.210 --> 38:56.430
They were saying all the time

38:56.480 --> 38:59.430
that it would be super good for business.

38:59.480 --> 39:02.449
You know, if we ever got married.

39:03.910 --> 39:04.743
- That's crazy.

39:05.800 --> 39:07.600
- I'm afraid they're a package deal.

39:08.580 --> 39:10.803
- They were so old school.

39:12.510 --> 39:14.330
- Okay, I am bored!

39:14.380 --> 39:15.750
What is next?

39:15.800 --> 39:16.770
- I got a surprise for you, buddy.

39:16.820 --> 39:18.534
- Oh yeah!
- So, how do we start--

39:25.413 --> 39:26.995
- Woo!

39:27.045 --> 39:27.878
Yeah!

39:32.106 --> 39:34.600
- That's really who we're selling to?

39:34.650 --> 39:35.820
- Yep.

39:35.870 --> 39:36.653
- You think they intend

39:36.703 --> 39:37.990
to keep the place the way it is?

39:38.040 --> 39:39.555
- Where you going?

39:39.605 --> 39:41.350
- I'm gonna go put a stop to
it before someone gets hurt

39:41.400 --> 39:44.416
and maybe make life a
little more shitty for them.

39:44.466 --> 39:45.633
- Woo!

39:54.450 --> 39:55.820
- Firearms aren't
permitted on the camp ground.

39:55.870 --> 39:56.970
- Oops.

39:57.020 --> 39:57.803
- If you give it to me,

39:57.853 --> 40:00.282
I'll make certain you get
it back when you leave.

40:00.332 --> 40:01.927
- You weren't supposed to see that.

40:01.977 --> 40:05.371
I'll have to kill you.

40:05.421 --> 40:06.470
- Nate, you don't have to do that.

40:06.520 --> 40:07.450
You'll hurt yourself.

40:07.500 --> 40:08.283
- Someone!

40:08.333 --> 40:09.720
You could hurt nay single one of us.

40:09.770 --> 40:11.160
Nate, give me the gun.

40:11.210 --> 40:12.142
- Huh?

40:12.192 --> 40:13.065
You want it?

40:13.115 --> 40:13.948
Come here.

40:17.277 --> 40:18.410
- Who're you calling?

40:18.460 --> 40:19.830
- Give it back,
I'm calling the police.

40:19.880 --> 40:21.200
- You don't have to call the police.

40:21.250 --> 40:22.530
Okay, we don't have to get them involved.

40:22.580 --> 40:24.830
I'll pay you, I have money, okay?

40:24.880 --> 40:26.241
How much do you want?

40:29.570 --> 40:31.089
- These are the people
you're hanging out with?

40:31.139 --> 40:34.139
- Give him his phone back!

40:39.874 --> 40:40.984
- Bitch!

41:00.830 --> 41:01.663
Fuck.

41:07.980 --> 41:09.043
- What's wrong?

41:12.010 --> 41:13.550
- It's gone.

41:13.600 --> 41:14.383
- What's gone?

41:14.433 --> 41:16.120
- Mom's necklace.

41:16.170 --> 41:17.640
- It's okay, we'll get you another one.

41:17.690 --> 41:19.310
- I don't want another one.

41:19.360 --> 41:21.560
You know how much this
necklace means to me.

41:22.480 --> 41:23.870
The pearl's from my mom's wedding ring.

41:23.920 --> 41:25.363
She had it mounted for me.

41:27.060 --> 41:28.060
- It's okay, we'll go to the jeweler

41:28.110 --> 41:29.840
and get you a nice big one.

41:29.890 --> 41:30.837
- You don't get it.

41:30.887 --> 41:33.137
Money can't buy everything.

41:34.271 --> 41:35.054
Oh, fuck.

41:35.104 --> 41:35.887
- It's okay.

41:35.937 --> 41:37.070
Come on.

41:37.120 --> 41:38.083
- Leave me alone.

41:45.554 --> 41:47.221
- Signal sucks here.

42:39.940 --> 42:40.773
- Nate?

42:42.106 --> 42:43.200
- Hey.

42:43.250 --> 42:44.083
- Morning.

42:52.680 --> 42:54.840
- Breakfast will be
ready in about an hour.

42:54.890 --> 42:56.530
- I'll try to go find my necklace.

42:56.580 --> 42:58.010
- You want a ride?

42:58.060 --> 42:59.860
- I'll use the run to clear my head.

43:01.015 --> 43:05.838
- Okay.

43:32.166 --> 43:32.999
- Hey.

43:34.616 --> 43:35.616
How are you?

43:40.085 --> 43:41.540
Morning.

43:41.590 --> 43:43.360
- Where's Nate?

43:43.410 --> 43:44.730
- Saw him this morning.

43:44.780 --> 43:47.240
He was acting super suspicious.

43:47.290 --> 43:48.700
- He's always acting suspicious.

43:48.750 --> 43:50.123
- Yeah but more than usual.

43:54.800 --> 43:55.963
Speak of the devil.

43:57.200 --> 43:58.140
- Morning.

43:58.190 --> 43:59.220
- Hey.

43:59.270 --> 44:00.163
Where were you?

44:01.580 --> 44:04.510
- Going to get this while
he was making breakfast.

44:04.560 --> 44:05.343
- Put that away.

44:05.393 --> 44:07.642
- I don't care, it's mine.

44:20.670 --> 44:23.660
- Hey, I'm sorry about last night.

44:23.710 --> 44:26.123
I know you don't like it
when I flaunt my wealth.

44:27.400 --> 44:28.960
- Why do it then?

44:29.010 --> 44:30.960
- It's because of this guy.

44:31.010 --> 44:33.190
He thinks he's better than us.

44:33.240 --> 44:34.910
- I don't see it that way.

44:34.960 --> 44:37.493
I think he's just really
protective of this place.

44:38.330 --> 44:39.730
- I was just trying to help.

44:40.890 --> 44:41.723
Forgive me?

44:42.670 --> 44:45.132
- Yeah, I know you meant well.

44:45.182 --> 44:46.953
- Hey, guys!

44:56.942 --> 44:58.164
- You have five dollars?

44:58.214 --> 45:00.191
Do you have five dollars?

46:03.542 --> 46:04.483
You're thinking maybe

46:04.533 --> 46:05.468
I can't handle my liquor.
- Much less nice

46:05.518 --> 46:07.698
but don't get too much.

46:07.748 --> 46:09.626
I'm gonna take a bottle.

46:09.676 --> 46:10.750
- Yep.

46:14.110 --> 46:17.000
Oh, you two just look darling.

46:17.050 --> 46:18.658
You fuck and make up?

46:18.708 --> 46:19.620
- Don't be an asshole.

46:19.670 --> 46:21.930
We made love.
- Yeah.

46:21.980 --> 46:23.260
Made love.

46:23.310 --> 46:24.750
- You drive me to this.

46:26.780 --> 46:27.790
- Where's Max?

46:27.840 --> 46:29.130
- He's resting.

46:29.180 --> 46:31.760
Last night was too much.

46:31.810 --> 46:32.890
I'll go look for him.

46:32.940 --> 46:34.420
- I'd be careful.

46:34.470 --> 46:36.370
Might think you're trying to get some.

46:42.512 --> 46:44.112
- Here, bonus.

46:44.162 --> 46:46.190
Use protection.

46:46.240 --> 46:48.717
- Any tequila back there for me?

46:54.271 --> 46:55.104
- Max?

46:57.127 --> 46:57.960
Hey.

47:00.159 --> 47:01.867
Are you okay?

47:01.917 --> 47:02.700
- How dare you.

47:02.750 --> 47:03.760
How dare you.

47:03.810 --> 47:05.165
This is my house.

47:05.215 --> 47:05.998
- Okay.

47:06.048 --> 47:06.935
- My house.
- This is good.

47:06.985 --> 47:07.768
- Yeah?

47:07.818 --> 47:08.985
Yeah, that's--

47:16.810 --> 47:17.733
- He's not here.

47:19.030 --> 47:19.830
- That's weird.

47:19.880 --> 47:21.300
Where else could he be?

47:21.350 --> 47:23.643
- Did he go do the rock samples?

47:25.600 --> 47:26.661
- We went yesterday.

47:26.711 --> 47:28.040
- Fuck.

47:28.090 --> 47:29.594
- What rock samples?

47:30.700 --> 47:31.730
- No service.

47:31.780 --> 47:33.153
- What rock samples?

47:34.340 --> 47:36.080
- Samples of rocks.

47:36.130 --> 47:38.120
Aaron wants to mine graphite.

47:38.170 --> 47:39.320
That's why we are here.

47:40.720 --> 47:43.263
Are you the only one that doesn't know it?

47:45.730 --> 47:47.110
- Aaron?

47:47.160 --> 47:48.653
What rock samples?

47:57.913 --> 47:58.746
- Yeah?

48:01.840 --> 48:03.090
Okay, I'll be there soon.

48:11.842 --> 48:13.513
- Max, it's not fucking funny!

48:13.563 --> 48:14.503
- Max!

48:17.590 --> 48:18.420
- I can't believe I trusted

48:18.470 --> 48:20.120
you would do something
good with this camp.

48:20.170 --> 48:21.280
- I am.

48:21.330 --> 48:22.510
I know you're an environmentalist

48:22.560 --> 48:24.240
and I was going to consult you on that.

48:24.290 --> 48:25.900
- When?

48:25.950 --> 48:27.070
When were you going to tell me?

48:27.120 --> 48:28.590
Why am I the last to know?

48:30.477 --> 48:32.350
You know what the best think
you could do for this camp

48:32.400 --> 48:34.700
is absolutely nothing at all.

48:34.750 --> 48:37.920
- There are people mining
minerals all over the world.

48:37.970 --> 48:38.753
Okay?

48:38.803 --> 48:40.077
There's graphite underneath here.

48:40.127 --> 48:41.740
- And I promised Julian that we would

48:41.790 --> 48:43.340
keep this camp the same.

48:43.390 --> 48:45.640
- Yeah, that's good,
that's part of your job.

48:48.880 --> 48:50.760
- You know I don't want
to be the type of lawyer

48:50.810 --> 48:53.580
who lies and covers up for
clients like your father.

48:53.630 --> 48:56.620
- You promised me you would
help me gain my father's trust.

48:56.670 --> 48:57.453
- Didn't realize that meant

48:57.503 --> 48:59.970
you were gonna be exactly like him.

49:03.615 --> 49:04.540
- What the fuck is he doing here?

49:04.590 --> 49:05.563
- I called him.

49:08.532 --> 49:09.315
- We should split up.

49:09.365 --> 49:11.110
Find him faster.

49:11.160 --> 49:12.210
- I'm going with you.

49:13.168 --> 49:14.085
- Fine.

49:14.135 --> 49:15.638
- Max!
- Maxime!

49:15.688 --> 49:16.493
- Max!

49:18.319 --> 49:20.486
- Fuck over here!

49:26.759 --> 49:27.542
- Come here!

49:27.592 --> 49:28.425
I found something!

49:30.150 --> 49:32.400
- Oh shit, that's
what he was wearing.

49:37.050 --> 49:37.883
- Let's go.

49:44.918 --> 49:45.751
Max?

49:57.044 --> 49:57.877
- Max?

50:03.017 --> 50:03.850
- Max!

50:09.900 --> 50:10.733
- Max?

50:21.894 --> 50:22.727
- God.

50:33.320 --> 50:35.283
- Some kind of animal bones.

50:35.333 --> 50:36.713
- I don't care what it is.

50:37.600 --> 50:39.313
I just want to get out of here.

50:40.400 --> 50:41.283
- Hold on to me.

50:48.663 --> 50:50.027
- I see something!

50:50.938 --> 50:51.792
- Max?

50:51.842 --> 50:52.925
- Max!

50:54.079 --> 50:55.020
- Max?

50:55.070 --> 50:56.237
- Max!

50:57.579 --> 50:59.149
- Stop running!

50:59.199 --> 51:01.296
- Max, come here!

51:01.346 --> 51:03.096
Fuck, Nate, you okay?

51:11.607 --> 51:13.857
- What the hell did you do?

51:29.156 --> 51:30.156
- Max.

51:30.206 --> 51:31.298
- Max?
- Oh shit.

51:31.348 --> 51:32.880
- Max, are you okay?

51:36.182 --> 51:36.965
- My leg!

51:37.015 --> 51:37.798
My leg!

51:39.481 --> 51:40.826
- Give me some gauze, give me some gauze.

51:40.876 --> 51:42.074
- It's okay.

51:42.124 --> 51:43.873
- Max, who did this to?

51:43.923 --> 51:45.160
- I don't know.

51:45.210 --> 51:47.030
Somebody jumped me from
behind and taped my mouth shut

51:47.080 --> 51:48.270
so I'd stop screaming.

51:48.320 --> 51:49.690
- Bet it was that fucking native.

51:49.740 --> 51:51.010
- Shut the fuck up!

51:51.060 --> 51:52.370
First of all, his name's Clay

51:52.420 --> 51:53.590
and he'd never do something like this.

51:53.640 --> 51:54.423
- Who else, man?

51:54.473 --> 51:55.960
No one else is here.

51:56.010 --> 51:57.000
- It doesn't mean it was him.

51:57.050 --> 51:58.590
We're not fenced in.

51:58.640 --> 51:59.520
- Fucking freaking!

51:59.570 --> 52:00.995
- I said, shut up!

52:01.045 --> 52:02.533
- Hey, don't fucking touch him!

52:04.374 --> 52:05.157
- Guys!

52:05.207 --> 52:06.240
This is really not the time!

52:06.290 --> 52:07.329
- Hey!

52:07.379 --> 52:09.634
I need to go to the hospital now!

52:10.849 --> 52:12.966
- Careful.

52:13.016 --> 52:14.063
Hold on, Max.
- Yeah.

52:20.007 --> 52:21.029
- Aaron?
- Yeah?

52:21.079 --> 52:21.960
- Do you have the gun?

52:22.010 --> 52:22.966
Can't be seen with it.

52:23.016 --> 52:23.849
- Nate?

52:25.400 --> 52:27.138
- Stay out of trouble!

52:34.352 --> 52:36.087
- Let's go question the fucking Indian.

52:36.137 --> 52:38.650
- But it doesn't even make sense.

52:38.700 --> 52:40.800
Why would he fuck with us like that?

52:40.850 --> 52:43.206
We are about to make
him a really rich man.

52:43.256 --> 52:45.280
- You don't think there's
something strange about him?

52:45.330 --> 52:46.163
I can feel it.

52:47.360 --> 52:48.183
- Nate,

52:48.233 --> 52:49.566
you're fucking--

52:51.056 --> 52:52.927
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

52:54.785 --> 52:55.735
Max.

52:55.785 --> 52:56.568
Breathe!

52:56.618 --> 52:57.796
Breathe!

52:57.846 --> 53:00.013
- It fucking hurts!

53:02.300 --> 53:04.467
- They didn't pick him up?

53:09.621 --> 53:10.404
- Come on!

53:17.840 --> 53:19.807
Do you have anything sharp on you?

53:22.420 --> 53:23.253
- Here.

53:24.723 --> 53:26.423
- Why do you have this?

53:27.270 --> 53:30.377
- You better don't trust
anyone, by the way.

53:30.427 --> 53:32.844
- That's the smartest goddamn
thing you've said all day.

53:32.894 --> 53:33.834
- Yeah.

53:37.150 --> 53:38.452
- Hey, native!

53:38.502 --> 53:39.335
Come out!

53:40.210 --> 53:41.708
- Can't you go faster?

53:52.841 --> 53:54.191
- What the hell's going on?

53:55.270 --> 53:56.266
- I don't know.

54:00.748 --> 54:03.165
- What the hell is happening?

54:08.634 --> 54:10.069
- What're you guys doing here?

54:10.952 --> 54:12.757
- If you don't come out, we're coming in!

54:20.174 --> 54:21.860
- What can I do for you kids?

54:21.910 --> 54:23.120
- Listen, you did something
to our fucking friend

54:23.170 --> 54:24.640
and I wanna know what it was.

54:24.690 --> 54:25.810
- What's happening?

54:25.860 --> 54:27.640
- The area's being secured.

54:27.690 --> 54:29.130
Leave now, no one can go in.

54:29.180 --> 54:29.963
- This is bullshit!

54:30.013 --> 54:30.881
Tell him we need to go to the hospital.

54:30.931 --> 54:31.764
- Hey.

54:33.502 --> 54:35.070
- He needs help.

54:35.120 --> 54:36.220
- Like I said,

54:36.270 --> 54:37.873
no one can go in.

54:40.970 --> 54:43.090
- The bones, the mask, that was you.

54:43.140 --> 54:43.973
- Listen, kid!

54:46.290 --> 54:47.073
This here rifle will tear

54:47.123 --> 54:48.870
your head right off your shoulders.

54:53.333 --> 54:54.463
Do you get me?

55:03.590 --> 55:05.646
Do you get me?

55:05.696 --> 55:06.890
- Where do you guys come from anyway?

55:06.940 --> 55:07.890
- Camping La Tuque.

55:09.720 --> 55:11.410
- We were told this camp is closed.

55:11.460 --> 55:13.339
- Obviously not completely.

55:15.970 --> 55:16.803
- Stay put.

55:18.100 --> 55:20.083
- Oh my god, we don't have time for this!

55:30.664 --> 55:31.741
- Who's there?

55:37.370 --> 55:38.440
- Okay.

55:38.490 --> 55:40.870
You guys go back to your camp,

55:40.920 --> 55:43.290
you stay indoors the whole night.

55:43.340 --> 55:44.303
- Show yourself!

55:48.280 --> 55:49.113
Mario.

55:50.350 --> 55:51.400
What happened to you?

55:52.870 --> 55:53.653
- Yeah fucking right.

55:53.703 --> 55:54.740
You put a mask on him too?

55:54.790 --> 55:56.730
- No, this has nothing to do with me.

55:56.780 --> 55:59.113
- A military copter will come
and pick you in the morning.

56:02.497 --> 56:03.767
- Get the fuck off!

56:05.168 --> 56:05.951
- Drive the car!

56:06.001 --> 56:08.251
Drive, drive, drive, drive!

56:18.452 --> 56:23.452
♪ The witches fly and always
cry when I fail them ♪

56:28.007 --> 56:33.007
♪ All tied up in knots
waiting for the fury ♪

56:35.711 --> 56:37.024
- It won't start!

56:37.074 --> 56:42.074
♪ But the beast inside is
telling me not to worry ♪

56:43.418 --> 56:45.426
- Get me out of here!

56:49.729 --> 56:53.469
♪ Here comes the monster ♪

56:53.519 --> 56:58.519
♪ Here comes the monster ♪

56:58.802 --> 57:00.890
♪ Here comes the monster ♪

57:05.861 --> 57:06.694
- Fuck!

57:14.487 --> 57:17.737
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, Clay, it's just us!

57:20.733 --> 57:22.483
What happened to him?

57:23.344 --> 57:25.983
- Where's Max?
- What the fuck?

57:26.033 --> 57:29.635
- Where's Max?

57:29.685 --> 57:34.685
Where's Max?

57:34.873 --> 57:36.470
Where is Max?

57:36.520 --> 57:37.587
- They killed him.

57:37.637 --> 57:39.260
- And you just fucking left him?

57:39.310 --> 57:40.310
- You think we did it on purpose?

57:40.360 --> 57:41.520
They took him.

57:41.570 --> 57:42.570
- We'll take my car.

57:44.530 --> 57:45.480
- We can't do that.

57:48.710 --> 57:49.800
I wanted payback.

57:49.850 --> 57:51.133
I slashed your tires.

57:54.100 --> 57:55.430
- What about the Mercedes?

57:55.480 --> 57:57.250
- I can't find the keys.

57:57.300 --> 57:58.850
- We don't have any other cars.

57:59.890 --> 58:01.890
That solider, he said to
stay inside overnight

58:01.940 --> 58:03.638
and they'll send a
helicopter in the morning.

58:03.688 --> 58:05.408
- The Warehouse.

58:05.458 --> 58:06.508
Do you have the keys?

58:07.820 --> 58:08.653
- Gatehouse.

58:10.230 --> 58:11.760
- You and I will go.

58:11.810 --> 58:13.430
- Aaron, you go with them
and call your father.

58:13.480 --> 58:14.495
Have him send us the helicopter.

58:14.545 --> 58:15.328
- No, I can't,

58:15.378 --> 58:16.310
I'm not calling my father.
- Aaron, we're in danger!

58:16.360 --> 58:17.143
Call your father!

58:17.193 --> 58:18.430
- We're not calling him!

58:18.480 --> 58:20.540
Okay, the helicopter's
too small for us anyway.

58:20.590 --> 58:22.470
I'll take care of you, I'll
take care of all of us.

58:22.520 --> 58:25.464
- Look what you fucking did to Max!

58:25.514 --> 58:26.900
- The rest of you,

58:26.950 --> 58:29.133
wait in my trailer until
we come back for you.

58:59.870 --> 59:01.880
- What you're doing is rude.

59:01.930 --> 59:03.990
- Would you shut the fuck up for once?

59:04.040 --> 59:05.720
- You don't need to yell at me.

59:05.770 --> 59:06.930
Aaron!

59:06.980 --> 59:08.840
Your girlfriend's being a bitch.

59:08.890 --> 59:09.840
- I'll call my dad.

59:12.720 --> 59:13.503
Fuck!

59:13.553 --> 59:14.680
The service is ridiculous.

59:14.730 --> 59:16.593
- There has to
be a way out of here!

59:17.450 --> 59:18.460
- They will find us.

59:18.510 --> 59:19.293
- Guys!

59:19.343 --> 59:20.910
Clay told us to stay here.

59:20.960 --> 59:23.380
We are gonna be safe as
long as we stay inside.

59:23.430 --> 59:24.920
- You shut the fuck up!

59:24.970 --> 59:26.220
- You don't have to talk
to her like that, okay?

59:26.270 --> 59:28.702
- She's just as responsible as you!

59:28.752 --> 59:30.560
- Yeah, well, if you didn't
fucking turn off the radio,

59:30.610 --> 59:32.247
maybe we would've know
what was happening in time

59:32.297 --> 59:33.930
and we wouldn't be in this fucking mess!

59:33.980 --> 59:36.430
- We, we can't trust these people!

59:36.480 --> 59:37.773
We need to go!

59:39.130 --> 59:40.640
- We can take the trams.

59:40.690 --> 59:41.960
I saw it on the road.

59:42.010 --> 59:43.980
- Fine, then I'm gone!

59:44.030 --> 59:44.950
- I'm going too.

59:45.000 --> 59:47.343
- Guys, he told us to stay inside!

59:49.325 --> 59:50.989
Fucking hell.

59:51.039 --> 59:52.273
- Wait!

59:52.323 --> 59:53.171
Wait!

59:55.990 --> 59:57.299
Let's go, Nate!

59:59.629 --> 1:00:00.707
- Nate!

1:00:00.757 --> 1:00:01.590
Nate!

1:00:34.970 --> 1:00:35.753
- Phone's dead.

1:00:35.803 --> 1:00:36.636
- Not surprised.

1:00:37.633 --> 1:00:38.466
Got 'em.

1:00:39.523 --> 1:00:41.960
We just gotta get to a secure location.

1:00:42.010 --> 1:00:43.646
We'll be all right.

1:00:59.393 --> 1:01:00.176
- Fuck, fuck!

1:01:00.226 --> 1:01:01.267
- Come on, step on it!

1:01:01.317 --> 1:01:02.899
They're catching up!

1:01:02.949 --> 1:01:04.793
Can that thing not go any faster?

1:01:04.843 --> 1:01:05.676
- No!

1:01:07.656 --> 1:01:09.069
- We're surrounded!

1:01:17.084 --> 1:01:18.021
Aaron!

1:01:18.071 --> 1:01:18.904
Aaron!

1:01:24.410 --> 1:01:25.193
- Andrea!

1:01:25.243 --> 1:01:27.408
Take the fucking gun!

1:01:34.512 --> 1:01:36.179
- How do I shoot it?

1:01:55.747 --> 1:01:58.025
- What do you not understand
about staying put?

1:01:58.075 --> 1:02:00.830
- We thought you wouldn't
come back for us.

1:02:00.880 --> 1:02:02.363
- Come on, get the hell out of there.

1:02:04.170 --> 1:02:05.003
Move, now!

1:02:06.257 --> 1:02:07.750
We gotta get to the warehouse.

1:02:07.800 --> 1:02:09.130
Important thing is not to stop.

1:02:09.180 --> 1:02:10.130
I'll take the lead.

1:02:11.080 --> 1:02:12.180
- Max?

1:02:26.635 --> 1:02:27.556
- No!

1:02:43.151 --> 1:02:45.068
- Get the fuck off her!

1:02:49.575 --> 1:02:50.470
- The warehouse!

1:02:50.520 --> 1:02:52.080
- Lead the way.

1:02:52.130 --> 1:02:54.047
Go, guys, go, go, go, go!

1:02:57.930 --> 1:02:59.210
Hey!

1:02:59.260 --> 1:03:00.302
- What the hell are you doing?

1:03:00.352 --> 1:03:01.571
- Follow Clay!

1:03:01.621 --> 1:03:02.416
- No!

1:03:02.466 --> 1:03:04.192
I'm not leaving you alone.

1:03:18.759 --> 1:03:20.592
- There's one.

1:03:39.810 --> 1:03:40.643
Shit.

1:05:02.513 --> 1:05:03.363
- Grab that bar!

1:05:04.449 --> 1:05:07.061
- We need to close this door!

1:05:22.714 --> 1:05:25.409
- That should hold them for a bit.

1:05:28.944 --> 1:05:29.967
- Okay, okay, okay.

1:05:30.017 --> 1:05:32.231
Okay Aaron, okay Aaron, okay Aaron.

1:05:38.250 --> 1:05:39.970
They can't get through here, right?

1:05:40.020 --> 1:05:41.550
- Hope not.

1:05:41.600 --> 1:05:45.030
And besides, even if they
do, Vanessa will handle them.

1:05:45.080 --> 1:05:46.722
- Stop making fun of me.

1:05:46.772 --> 1:05:48.063
- I'm not making fun of you.

1:05:48.113 --> 1:05:49.660
I'm fucking impressed.

1:05:49.710 --> 1:05:50.819
It's a sturdy building.

1:05:53.580 --> 1:05:54.943
Are you fucking crazy?

1:05:57.060 --> 1:05:59.100
- The solider said we need
to stay inside, right?

1:05:59.150 --> 1:06:00.800
So we just stay here, okay, right?

1:06:00.850 --> 1:06:02.195
And we don't have to go to the warehouse.

1:06:03.078 --> 1:06:04.197
- Oh shit!

1:06:04.247 --> 1:06:05.524
Fuck!

1:06:05.574 --> 1:06:06.357
- They're gonna kill us!

1:06:06.407 --> 1:06:08.573
We need to get out of here!

1:06:16.455 --> 1:06:17.292
- Vanessa!

1:06:17.342 --> 1:06:18.427
Give me the gun!

1:06:20.714 --> 1:06:21.547
- Julian!

1:06:26.802 --> 1:06:27.856
- It's Aaron!

1:06:27.906 --> 1:06:28.739
Let us in!

1:06:49.419 --> 1:06:51.578
- Where's Julian?

1:06:51.628 --> 1:06:52.935
- He's still out there.

1:06:52.985 --> 1:06:53.818
- He saved us.

1:06:55.628 --> 1:06:57.535
- We need to go back for him.

1:06:57.585 --> 1:06:58.735
- We need more weapons.

1:07:09.820 --> 1:07:10.653
- You okay?

1:07:17.785 --> 1:07:18.618
No, no.

1:07:20.280 --> 1:07:21.443
- She's okay for now.

1:07:41.620 --> 1:07:42.823
It's Julian's space.

1:07:50.896 --> 1:07:52.397
- It's a really cool place.

1:07:52.447 --> 1:07:54.343
- He doesn't look like much.

1:07:55.330 --> 1:07:56.583
The kid's going places.

1:08:03.110 --> 1:08:05.310
- I get why this place
means so much to him.

1:08:12.410 --> 1:08:15.010
- He always came first at
his school sciences fairs.

1:08:16.860 --> 1:08:18.483
Keeps his awards in a box.

1:08:20.770 --> 1:08:22.770
I always say, "you gotta display these."

1:08:23.740 --> 1:08:25.790
But he just says he has nothing to prove.

1:08:29.320 --> 1:08:30.987
- You two are close.

1:08:32.613 --> 1:08:33.533
- Like a son.

1:08:38.910 --> 1:08:40.010
- What's this?

1:08:45.890 --> 1:08:47.371
- How's Andrea?

1:08:47.421 --> 1:08:48.690
- Not good.

1:08:48.740 --> 1:08:50.593
I have to bring her back in one piece.

1:09:12.280 --> 1:09:14.909
- What, are you scared of the
water, you pieces of shit?

1:09:32.010 --> 1:09:34.010
- He'll be here.

1:09:34.060 --> 1:09:36.610
- I'll feel responsible if
anything happens to him.

1:09:38.320 --> 1:09:40.723
- Julian never does anything
he doesn't wanna do.

1:10:03.100 --> 1:10:04.267
- Oh fucking god!

1:10:07.710 --> 1:10:08.983
- Hey, hey, hey, brother!

1:10:09.033 --> 1:10:11.258
Calm down, calm down!

1:10:11.308 --> 1:10:12.227
- Fuck!

1:10:12.277 --> 1:10:13.610
- Hey!

1:10:23.320 --> 1:10:25.229
- The virus has mutated.

1:10:29.551 --> 1:10:31.884
- What're you talking about?

1:10:33.521 --> 1:10:35.033
- I thought it was just the flu.

1:10:36.200 --> 1:10:37.260
- How could you think that?

1:10:37.310 --> 1:10:39.160
It's obviously way more than the flu.

1:10:39.210 --> 1:10:40.910
- I said I thought it was the flu.

1:10:41.770 --> 1:10:44.990
- Been on the trail of
this virus for awhile now.

1:10:45.040 --> 1:10:47.860
It started out as a small,
controlled experiment in a lab.

1:10:47.910 --> 1:10:49.242
- Shut up with your conspiracy theories!

1:10:49.292 --> 1:10:50.125
- Aaron.

1:10:57.223 --> 1:10:59.062
- You're right.

1:10:59.112 --> 1:11:00.270
You don't wanna know.

1:11:00.320 --> 1:11:01.153
- I wanna know.

1:11:04.815 --> 1:11:07.270
- It started out as a
small, controlled experiment

1:11:07.320 --> 1:11:09.870
to test a new vaccine,
which obviously didn't work.

1:11:10.860 --> 1:11:13.560
In the meantime, the government
confiscated the virus,

1:11:13.610 --> 1:11:14.687
saying they were gonna destroy it

1:11:14.737 --> 1:11:17.360
before it caused serious damage.

1:11:17.410 --> 1:11:19.303
- Then why the hell is all this happening?

1:11:20.610 --> 1:11:23.530
- The government kept
the virus for themselves

1:11:23.580 --> 1:11:24.703
as a defense weapon.

1:11:25.640 --> 1:11:27.717
Put the blame on foreign soil.

1:11:29.229 --> 1:11:31.179
No one knew how dangerous the virus was

1:11:32.151 --> 1:11:33.551
or how fast it could spread.

1:12:04.424 --> 1:12:07.683
- We're gonna make it out of here, right?

1:12:12.020 --> 1:12:13.633
- You know, despite everything,

1:12:15.216 --> 1:12:18.200
you're still the most
important person in my life.

1:12:18.250 --> 1:12:21.140
I'm not gonna let anything happen to you.

1:12:26.343 --> 1:12:28.040
- Is this the virus?

1:12:28.090 --> 1:12:28.933
- I think so.

1:12:30.200 --> 1:12:33.070
Looks like the virus is
traveling directly to the brain,

1:12:33.120 --> 1:12:35.893
temporarily shutting down
all nervous system reactors.

1:12:36.750 --> 1:12:37.800
That was one of the side effects

1:12:37.850 --> 1:12:39.880
when they tested the virus on the mice.

1:12:39.930 --> 1:12:42.090
- They knew about this?

1:12:42.140 --> 1:12:44.950
- People with money
can be quite dangerous.

1:12:45.000 --> 1:12:45.833
- Is that a dig?

1:12:48.010 --> 1:12:48.960
- You tell me.

1:13:24.684 --> 1:13:26.037
- Andrea!

1:13:33.761 --> 1:13:35.517
- Get away from there!

1:14:01.770 --> 1:14:02.553
- Guys!

1:14:02.603 --> 1:14:05.343
I need some fucking help here!

1:14:08.737 --> 1:14:10.631
Get her the fuck off me!

1:14:23.616 --> 1:14:25.013
- Aaron, help me hold her!

1:14:25.063 --> 1:14:25.896
- Yeah.

1:14:26.784 --> 1:14:28.034
- Grab me rope!

1:15:05.178 --> 1:15:08.261
- Is that what you're gonna do to me?

1:15:14.684 --> 1:15:15.535
- What're you doing?

1:15:15.585 --> 1:15:17.177
- Nate, no!
- Nate, no!

1:15:18.959 --> 1:15:20.312
- No!

1:15:28.320 --> 1:15:29.115
- Guys!

1:15:29.165 --> 1:15:30.013
We have to get to the dock!

1:15:30.063 --> 1:15:32.307
They won't follow us
to the water, come on!

1:15:32.357 --> 1:15:33.733
We can get there before morning!

1:15:40.634 --> 1:15:41.901
- There's more than before!

1:15:41.951 --> 1:15:43.184
- The military
must've done a good job

1:15:43.234 --> 1:15:44.700
with the fucking evacuation.

1:15:44.750 --> 1:15:47.196
- Yeah, and sent them all to us!

1:15:48.673 --> 1:15:49.466
- Keep going!

1:15:49.516 --> 1:15:50.916
I'll be right there!

1:16:03.286 --> 1:16:05.250
Get to the dock!

1:16:05.300 --> 1:16:06.624
- Clay!

1:16:11.903 --> 1:16:13.485
- Julian!

1:16:13.535 --> 1:16:14.368
- Get off!

1:16:18.357 --> 1:16:19.140
- No!

1:16:19.190 --> 1:16:20.023
Julian!

1:16:29.875 --> 1:16:31.288
- I'll go.

1:16:54.720 --> 1:16:56.065
- Clay!

1:16:56.115 --> 1:16:56.898
Fuck!

1:16:56.948 --> 1:16:58.689
Vanessa, we gotta go, we gotta go!

1:16:58.739 --> 1:16:59.572
Come on!

1:17:55.063 --> 1:17:56.043
- It's so peaceful.

1:17:58.130 --> 1:17:58.963
- Yeah.

1:18:00.752 --> 1:18:01.835
It really is.

1:18:10.880 --> 1:18:11.930
Promise me something.

1:18:14.250 --> 1:18:15.690
- What?

1:18:15.740 --> 1:18:17.683
- If I start having a coughing fit,

1:18:18.860 --> 1:18:19.790
you'll kill me.

1:18:20.755 --> 1:18:23.134
- Don't talk like that.

1:18:23.184 --> 1:18:24.184
You're fine.

1:18:28.059 --> 1:18:31.610
- I don't wanna become one of them.

1:19:24.620 --> 1:19:25.870
- Does it hurt?

1:19:28.653 --> 1:19:30.666
No, you keep it.

1:19:30.716 --> 1:19:32.303
- I wanted to give it to you earlier.

1:19:33.159 --> 1:19:34.809
There's something inside for you.

1:19:56.655 --> 1:19:59.200
Found it in my golf cart.

1:19:59.250 --> 1:20:03.017
The chain was broken so I
soldered it back together.

1:20:44.143 --> 1:20:44.976
- No.

1:20:48.257 --> 1:20:49.090
I can't.

1:20:50.520 --> 1:20:53.420
- If you don't, I'll hurt you
and I don't want to do that.

1:20:55.130 --> 1:20:55.980
It's okay.

1:20:56.953 --> 1:20:58.203
I'm not scared.

1:21:01.355 --> 1:21:02.188
Fuck.

1:21:04.033 --> 1:21:04.866
Please.

1:21:11.759 --> 1:21:12.592
- I can't.
