WEBVTT

00:16.748 --> 00:18.250
We're finally here.

00:18.283 --> 00:19.785
It's our senior year.

00:19.817 --> 00:22.020
We navigated the madness,
avoided the sadness,

00:22.053 --> 00:24.389
and now it's time
for the new frontier.

00:24.422 --> 00:25.924
We got the jocks, the brains,

00:25.957 --> 00:27.726
and the just plain crazies.

00:27.759 --> 00:30.595
But our story is about
five young ladies.

00:30.628 --> 00:33.798
So sit back, relax,
chill, and be cool.

Uh, no, no.

04:07.279 --> 04:08.814
London.

04:09.614 --> 04:10.882
Thank you.

04:10.916 --> 04:13.085
You can pick up after class.

04:13.118 --> 04:16.956
Now, four x cubed

equals the sum of what?

04:20.591 --> 04:23.161

- Ooh.

04:30.868 --> 04:32.505
Somebody?

04:32.538 --> 04:33.139
Sydney.

04:34.639 --> 04:35.974
Perhaps you would like to
read that note out loud

04:36.007 --> 04:37.510
to the whole class.

04:37.543 --> 04:38.244
You can't do that.

04:38.276 --> 04:39.978
That's enough, London.

04:47.618 --> 04:50.589
Covering for your
friend, Sydney.

04:50.622 --> 04:52.525
She's not my friend.

04:53.558 --> 04:55.293
Of course not.

mane must be absorbing

And that's Miss
Macy, young lady.

05:09.308 --> 05:13.144
Well, Miss Macy, I'm
just doin' my thing.

05:13.178 --> 05:14.146
Oh really?

05:14.178 --> 05:15.613
Guess what?

05:15.647 --> 05:17.683
Now I'm just doing
my thing.

05:17.716 --> 05:18.751
Pick them up after school.

05:18.784 --> 05:20.019
Come on, Miss Macy.

05:20.051 --> 05:21.686
- I didn't do anything.
- You heard me.

05:21.719 --> 05:22.721
Oh my God.

05:27.325 --> 05:29.294
Hey, wait up.

05:29.327 --> 05:31.329
That was so cool.

05:31.363 --> 05:32.764
I'm Jake Roberts.

05:32.798 --> 05:34.700
Get lost, jerk.

05:34.733 --> 05:36.935
Uh, it's Jake not jerk.

05:38.337 --> 05:39.671
Whatever.

05:39.704 --> 05:41.039
I'm sensing you don't like me.

05:41.072 --> 05:42.674
Very perceptive.

05:49.348 --> 05:52.251
Did you tell her off, Jake?

05:52.284 --> 05:53.719
What's her name again?

05:53.752 --> 05:56.055
Sydney something or other.

05:56.087 --> 05:56.955
Sydney.

05:58.022 --> 05:58.757
Sydney.

06:01.360 --> 06:04.196
Good afternoon, this is
your principal Miss Macy.

06:04.228 --> 06:06.365
Will the following students
please report immediately

06:06.397 --> 06:08.200
to the principal's office?

06:08.233 --> 06:11.269
Veronica Steele, Stella Blue,

06:11.303 --> 06:15.341
Sydney Savage, Momentum,
and London Collin.

06:15.373 --> 06:16.341
Thank you.

06:20.745 --> 06:22.615
So why are we here?

06:24.315 --> 06:26.017
I don't know what your deal is

06:26.050 --> 06:28.087
but I was rappin'
in the hallway.

06:28.120 --> 06:30.221
Yeah well, I stole the
note that she was passing

06:30.255 --> 06:31.389
to her boyfriend.

06:31.423 --> 06:32.624
Excuse me.

06:32.658 --> 06:34.226
The teacher wanted me to read
it out loud and I wouldn't.

06:34.259 --> 06:35.394
I ripped it up.

06:35.426 --> 06:36.694
That's cool.

06:36.728 --> 06:39.832
You know, you should thank her.

06:39.865 --> 06:42.835
By the way, what
did the note say?

06:42.868 --> 06:44.769
None of your business.

06:44.803 --> 06:46.105
She was asking that jock Jake

06:46.137 --> 06:47.705
to take her to Homecoming.

06:47.738 --> 06:48.974
Yeah, right.

06:49.007 --> 06:50.709
Wait a minute, Jake,
as in Jake Roberts?

06:50.741 --> 06:53.111
That's your boyfriend?

06:53.144 --> 06:54.279
He is so hot.

06:55.813 --> 06:56.714
He's hot.

06:56.748 --> 06:58.117
Ugh.

06:58.149 --> 06:59.385
He's hot.

06:59.418 --> 07:01.153
No, he's not hot.

07:02.286 --> 07:04.156
You're Stella, right?

07:05.423 --> 07:07.125
That's me.

07:07.159 --> 07:10.129
The vice president
of Student Council?

07:10.161 --> 07:12.764
Now, what crime could you
have possibly committed.

07:12.798 --> 07:14.733
Chad and I were
protesting the budget cuts.

07:14.765 --> 07:16.334
So where's Chad then?

07:16.368 --> 07:17.736
He didn't get caught

07:17.769 --> 07:19.138
and it was all kind
of my idea anyway.

07:19.171 --> 07:21.440
Takin' the heat
for your boyfriend.

07:21.473 --> 07:22.775
Oh, no, no.

07:22.808 --> 07:25.276
Chad's not my boyfriend.

07:25.310 --> 07:28.881
Chad's that kid that
you're always with, right?

07:28.913 --> 07:32.151
- He's not your boyfriend.
- No, no, no, no.

07:32.183 --> 07:33.151
He's my best friend.

07:33.185 --> 07:34.452
I mean, we're inseparable.

07:34.486 --> 07:38.289
We've been friends since
first grade but that's it.

07:38.322 --> 07:43.329
Yeah, he follows her around
like a little lost puppy dog.

07:43.829 --> 07:44.697
Hi.

07:45.830 --> 07:48.466
It smells
like teen spirit.

07:48.500 --> 07:49.901
Or pot.

07:49.935 --> 07:53.038
So, Miss Macy,

07:53.070 --> 07:54.772
why are we being punished?

07:54.805 --> 07:55.907
Punished?

07:55.940 --> 07:58.376
Who said anything
about punishment?

07:58.409 --> 07:59.777
Quite the contrary.

07:59.810 --> 08:02.847
You girls have been
carefully chosen.

08:04.349 --> 08:05.183
Uh oh.

08:05.216 --> 08:07.118
Take it easy, Mo.

08:07.151 --> 08:09.854
Now, I've known you girls
for almost four years now

08:09.887 --> 08:12.190
and one thing I'm sure
of is that you are all

08:12.224 --> 08:16.195
independent thinkers as well
as natural born leaders,

08:16.228 --> 08:17.396
which is why I have decided

08:17.428 --> 08:18.930
that you are gonna lead

08:18.964 --> 08:21.434
our school assembly next week.

08:25.370 --> 08:27.339
Thank you, Miss Macy,
we'd be honored.

08:27.372 --> 08:30.476
And what assembly are
we honored to be leading?

08:30.509 --> 08:33.411
The Student Campaign
Against Bullying.

08:34.845 --> 08:35.513
That's cool.

08:35.546 --> 08:37.349
Wait, anti-bullying?

08:37.382 --> 08:38.349
Us?

08:38.382 --> 08:39.752
It's a good cause, Miss Macy.

08:39.785 --> 08:41.219
You're kidding, right?

08:41.252 --> 08:42.220
She's kidding.

08:42.253 --> 08:43.221
Please tell me you're kidding.

08:43.254 --> 08:43.955
No, I've never

08:43.988 --> 08:45.224
been more serious.

08:45.257 --> 08:47.425
Ladies, this has
become an epidemic

08:47.459 --> 08:50.963
not only in our school
but in the country.

08:50.996 --> 08:54.900
Cyberbullying, verbal
harassment, social isolation,

08:54.932 --> 08:56.834
and girls picking
on other girls.

08:56.868 --> 08:58.503
It's gotta stop.

08:58.536 --> 09:01.239
And you girls are
gonna lead the way.

09:01.272 --> 09:05.377
Think of it as extra credit
towards your senior project.

09:05.410 --> 09:07.846
So we are gonna lead the way

09:07.878 --> 09:09.514
on an anti-bullying assembly?

09:09.547 --> 09:10.381
Yeah.

09:10.415 --> 09:11.550
Yeah, I'm out.

09:11.583 --> 09:13.519
Mmm hmm, yeah, me too.

09:13.551 --> 09:15.853
I'm all in, Miss Macy.

09:15.887 --> 09:17.455
That's my girl.

09:17.488 --> 09:18.456
Look what you get?

09:18.489 --> 09:19.424
Yes.

09:21.292 --> 09:24.296
And the rest of
you have no choice.

09:30.569 --> 09:32.404
So, Mo, how are you gonna lead

09:32.436 --> 09:35.273
this anti-bullying assembly?

09:35.306 --> 09:36.874
I'll do what I do.

09:36.907 --> 09:38.810
Please.

09:38.844 --> 09:40.411

We have a serious situation here

13:48.292 --> 13:51.462

student's responsibility

13:51.496 --> 13:54.500
to create a safe
school environment.

So if you witness someone
being bullied, speak up,

13:59.570 --> 14:01.839
stand up, don't join in.

14:01.873 --> 14:04.810
And if you yourself
are being bullied,

14:04.843 --> 14:06.144
you tell someone.

14:06.176 --> 14:08.212
Tell your teacher,
tell your parents.

Tell me, I'll fix their wagon!

14:11.181 --> 14:12.084
Thank you.

20:22.085 --> 20:23.587
Hey, Jake.

20:23.621 --> 20:25.055
Oh, hey, London.

20:25.088 --> 20:25.923
Impressive.

20:25.957 --> 20:27.859
Thanks.

20:27.892 --> 20:30.929
So I was wondering do
you maybe wanna hang out

20:30.961 --> 20:32.129
after practice tonight?

20:32.162 --> 20:33.931
I'm sorry I can't
tonight, London.

20:33.965 --> 20:36.134
Oh, okay, well, then
maybe we can just, you know,

20:36.167 --> 20:39.137
try another night or something.

20:39.170 --> 20:40.138
I'll catch up with you later.

20:40.171 --> 20:43.475
Okay.

20:46.177 --> 20:47.646
Hey, superstar.

20:48.979 --> 20:50.547
I saw your group the other day.

20:50.581 --> 20:52.083
I'm a big fan.

20:52.115 --> 20:55.152
I was kinda wondering if I
could get your autograph.

20:55.186 --> 20:58.123
Actually it's for
my little sister.

21:00.290 --> 21:02.126
She's a big fan, too.

21:06.730 --> 21:08.098
And if it's not
too much trouble,

21:08.132 --> 21:09.333
could you include
your phone number?

21:09.366 --> 21:14.873
I'd really like to help with
the anti-bully thing and all.

21:15.273 --> 21:16.574
There you go.

21:16.606 --> 21:17.942
Hey, thank you.

21:22.279 --> 21:24.982
So who can tell me

21:25.016 --> 21:27.151
where Guatemala is located?

21:28.619 --> 21:30.021
You in the do-rag.

21:31.622 --> 21:32.990
Me?

21:33.024 --> 21:35.994
Yes, Diddy, you.

21:36.026 --> 21:39.631
Uh, could you repeat
the question please?

21:41.632 --> 21:42.901
Gua-ta-mala.

21:45.335 --> 21:47.171
Where is it located?

21:49.172 --> 21:50.307
That's an easy question

21:50.341 --> 21:52.142
'cause it's in the
center of America.

21:54.312 --> 21:56.147
Can you be more specific?

21:56.180 --> 21:58.549
Uh, I don't know
like Ohio or something.

21:59.717 --> 22:00.651
Ohio.

22:02.053 --> 22:03.621

22:16.334 --> 22:17.302
Okay.

22:21.072 --> 22:23.641
We will continue to study
the logarithmic functions

22:23.673 --> 22:26.944
as we attempt to
manipulate polynomials.

22:28.379 --> 22:32.617
Now, who can tell me how
we add polynomials, hmm?

22:33.718 --> 22:34.585
London?

22:36.687 --> 22:37.689
Polly who?

22:38.389 --> 22:39.357
Leo.

22:39.390 --> 22:42.193
Uh, you identify terms
with common variables

22:42.226 --> 22:44.929
and exponents and combine
them into a single term

22:44.961 --> 22:46.196
summing the coefficients.

22:46.229 --> 22:48.065
Very good, Leo.

22:48.098 --> 22:50.232
I hope everyone got that, hmm?

22:50.234 --> 22:52.070
No.

22:53.237 --> 22:54.072
Come on,

22:54.104 --> 22:54.939
hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em!

22:54.971 --> 22:56.007
Here you go, get it!

22:56.039 --> 22:56.907
Good, that's it!

22:56.940 --> 22:58.709
Bring it in, bring
it in, bring it in.

22:59.643 --> 23:01.278
Good practice.

23:01.312 --> 23:03.615
How am I going
to pass that class?

23:03.648 --> 23:06.351
Do you understand
any of that stuff?

23:06.383 --> 23:08.786
Girl, do what I do, cheat.

23:10.720 --> 23:13.357
I cheat off that brainy
kid Leo all the time.

23:13.391 --> 23:15.692
You can cheat off
me, problem solved.

23:15.726 --> 23:18.029
But, uh, you really do that?

23:18.062 --> 23:18.796
Hmm.

23:20.398 --> 23:25.103
Ooh has Jake over there
asked you to Homecoming yet?

23:26.737 --> 23:29.040
Not yet, but, I mean,
I've dropped enough hints.

23:29.073 --> 23:30.708
What about Rex?

23:30.740 --> 23:32.242
He asks me every day.

23:32.276 --> 23:33.244
That kid's desperate.

23:33.276 --> 23:34.345
No thank you.

23:35.746 --> 23:38.315
All right, well,
we should get going.

23:38.348 --> 23:40.117
Girls, let's go.

23:40.151 --> 23:41.318
Back in formation.

Hello.

23:54.765 --> 23:56.101
Um, all right.

23:58.302 --> 24:01.406
This brings to order the
Student Council meeting

24:01.439 --> 24:04.808
for this Saturday's
big Homecoming dance.

24:04.842 --> 24:07.745
No, but actually we do have
a big problem on our hands.

24:07.777 --> 24:09.747
Carless Antenna just canceled.

24:09.779 --> 24:11.348
Okay, why?

24:11.382 --> 24:13.750
Apparently the guitar
player broke his arm.

24:13.784 --> 24:14.886
Again?

24:14.919 --> 24:16.353
Okay, how does
that even happen?

24:16.386 --> 24:18.155
I don't know but what
are we going to do?

24:22.325 --> 24:24.796
All right, well, they're
not exactly Imagine Dragons

24:24.828 --> 24:27.164
but I don't know maybe
there's some other local band

24:27.198 --> 24:28.032
we can hire.

24:28.065 --> 24:29.100
At this short notice?

24:29.132 --> 24:30.767
Who could we possibly find?

24:30.801 --> 24:32.170
You.

24:32.202 --> 24:33.103
- Yeah.
- Me?

24:33.136 --> 24:34.171
- Yes.
- Drama Drama.

24:34.205 --> 24:35.273
Come on, you know

24:35.305 --> 24:36.908
- you want to, Stella.
- Guys, we're not a real band.

24:36.940 --> 24:39.776
Oh, okay, and
Carless Antenna is?

24:39.809 --> 24:41.778
Would other girls do it?

24:41.812 --> 24:44.181
You're acting like
I'm into this idea.

24:44.215 --> 24:45.183
We only know one song.

24:45.216 --> 24:46.484
Oh come on.

24:46.517 --> 24:48.186
Mo will definitely do it.

24:48.219 --> 24:49.187
I'll talk to Sydney and
Veronica and they'll do it.

24:49.219 --> 24:50.121
And I'll tell London
if she wants our vote

24:50.154 --> 24:53.857
for Homecoming queen,
she has to do it.

24:53.891 --> 24:54.825
Come on.

24:54.859 --> 24:56.327
Okay, I'll try.

24:56.360 --> 24:57.328
- Yeah.
- All right.

24:57.361 --> 24:58.329
- Done deal.
- Let's do it.

25:11.241 --> 25:13.377
Five, six, seven, eight.

25:14.978 --> 25:16.381
I don't need a...

25:19.517 --> 25:21.818
Five, six, seven, eight.

25:21.852 --> 25:23.854
I don't need a miracle.

25:25.922 --> 25:29.393
Good.

25:34.398 --> 25:36.901
Who can solve the
following equation?

25:36.933 --> 25:38.469
Miss London Collin.

25:40.203 --> 25:41.238
No way.

25:41.271 --> 25:43.240
I have no idea.

25:43.274 --> 25:45.376
Perhaps it will help
if I give you a hint.

25:45.409 --> 25:49.247
All of the coefficients
are integers.

25:49.279 --> 25:51.248
Congratulations.

25:55.553 --> 25:56.421
Thank you.

25:57.888 --> 25:59.524
Leo Hopkins, can you
come to the board

25:59.556 --> 26:01.992
and solve this somewhat
simplistic equation

26:02.026 --> 26:03.527
for Miss Collin?

26:03.561 --> 26:07.398
Yeah, I'll try.

26:07.430 --> 26:09.866
Miss Collin, I'd like
you to stick around

26:09.900 --> 26:11.503
after the bell rings.

26:13.304 --> 26:15.206
Drama drama.

26:22.513 --> 26:23.581
Hi, Leo.

26:23.613 --> 26:26.417
Uh, hi, Madison.

26:26.450 --> 26:30.421
I wanna make sure
you study really hard

26:30.453 --> 26:32.289
for the next test.

26:32.323 --> 26:33.792
Uh, okay, sure.

26:39.330 --> 26:40.231
What's up, nerd?

26:40.264 --> 26:41.966
What the, what the hell, man?

26:41.998 --> 26:44.434
Hey, Rex, how 'bout next
time at football practice

26:44.468 --> 26:46.903
I show you what a tackle
really feels like.

26:46.937 --> 26:49.940
I saw him
talking to Madison.

26:51.941 --> 26:53.344
Whoa, whoa, hey.

26:54.344 --> 26:55.046
You forgot something.

26:56.479 --> 26:57.347
Sorry.

27:03.353 --> 27:04.455
You okay, man?

27:04.488 --> 27:06.224
Yeah, thanks, man.

27:08.659 --> 27:10.261
Tell me, Miss Collin,

27:10.294 --> 27:12.930
how do you expect
to pass my class?

27:12.962 --> 27:13.897
I don't.

27:13.930 --> 27:15.999
I mean, no offense Mr.
Chaudry but, I mean,

27:16.033 --> 27:17.468
what's the point anyways?

27:17.500 --> 27:19.469
It's not like I'm gonna use
any of this in real life.

27:19.503 --> 27:21.339
Oh, no offense taken.

27:21.372 --> 27:24.208
On last week's
quiz, you got a 13.

27:24.240 --> 27:26.477
Luckily I have a solution.

27:26.509 --> 27:29.479
Leo Hopkins has generously
agreed to donate his time

27:29.513 --> 27:30.481
and tutor you.

27:30.514 --> 27:31.349
Leo?

27:31.382 --> 27:32.350
Please.

27:32.382 --> 27:33.317
Fair enough.

27:33.351 --> 27:35.953
It's your decision, but
fortunately for you,

27:35.986 --> 27:38.488
you need to pass this
class in order to graduate.

27:38.521 --> 27:42.025
And as of right now,
well, you're failing.

27:43.393 --> 27:45.662
Mr. Chaudry, but I have
cheerleading practice

27:45.696 --> 27:47.365
and then I have Drama
Drama rehearsals

27:47.398 --> 27:49.634
so as you see, it
just won't work, okay?

27:50.534 --> 27:52.670
It's your choice.

27:52.702 --> 27:55.373
Fail equals no graduation.

27:55.405 --> 27:56.373
Or call Leo.

very dapper.

34:36.939 --> 34:41.077
Madison, Jake just
bolted and I'm all alone.

34:41.111 --> 34:43.814
Babe, he's not that into you.

34:44.814 --> 34:45.815

35:00.029 --> 35:03.033
Nope, I'm already
walking me home.

35:04.500 --> 35:08.439
Okay, then I'll kinda be
like your personal stalker.

35:09.439 --> 35:10.341
Fine.

35:12.576 --> 35:16.413
So why isn't the Homecoming
king with his Homecoming queen?

35:16.446 --> 35:19.083
Well, we had the
traditional first dance

35:19.116 --> 35:20.951
which completes my
requirements as king.

35:20.984 --> 35:21.852
Mmm.

35:22.986 --> 35:25.122
I wanted to dance with you

35:25.154 --> 35:26.457
but you were gone.

35:26.489 --> 35:28.825
What
is this, Cinderella?

35:28.859 --> 35:31.127
I'm asking you out
on a date, Sydney.

35:31.160 --> 35:33.830
Okay, listen, you
seem like a nice guy

35:33.864 --> 35:36.834
- but really you're not my type.
- Not my type?

35:36.866 --> 35:37.734
Hmm.

35:38.868 --> 35:39.870
How did I know you
were gonna say that?

35:39.904 --> 35:43.841
Because we have absolutely
nothing in common.

35:45.875 --> 35:46.810
Looks like Madison's all over

35:46.843 --> 35:48.978
- your boyfriend Chad.
- He's not my boyfriend.

35:49.011 --> 35:49.979
Save it, Stella.

35:50.013 --> 35:52.850
I see you looking over
there every two seconds.

35:52.882 --> 35:54.852
You ain't foolin' nobody.

35:54.884 --> 35:56.587
I just don't think
she's right for him.

36:23.913 --> 36:24.881
were intense, all right?

36:24.915 --> 36:26.483
And, Stella, you were amazing.

36:26.515 --> 36:29.752
I love, love, love your voice.

36:29.785 --> 36:31.187
Muah, muah!

36:31.221 --> 36:33.157
Gracias, dude.

36:33.189 --> 36:35.158
He's got the
biggest crush on you.

36:35.192 --> 36:37.027
So, we got the
king and the queen

36:37.060 --> 36:38.495
and now they're making a scene.

36:38.527 --> 36:40.430
And London keeps wondering
if Jake is a fake

36:40.464 --> 36:41.899
Drama Drama getting
closer and closer

36:41.931 --> 36:43.567
to their namesake.

36:43.600 --> 36:44.835
But PM is done here.

36:44.868 --> 36:45.768
But don't be afraid.

36:45.801 --> 36:46.903
He'll be back later.

36:46.937 --> 36:48.572
Let's let the lights fade.

36:50.473 --> 36:53.443
Okay, let's say we did go out,

36:53.477 --> 36:54.545
what would we do?

36:54.578 --> 36:56.846
But not saying that we would.

36:56.879 --> 36:58.047
Anything you want.

37:00.216 --> 37:01.584
Dinner, a movie?

37:02.953 --> 37:03.821
Mmm.

37:04.620 --> 37:05.555
Miniature golf?

37:05.589 --> 37:06.857
Mmm nnn nnn.

37:06.890 --> 37:08.058
We could even
check out a band.

37:08.091 --> 37:12.630
Oh, trust me, we do not
have the same taste in music.

37:14.163 --> 37:15.098
Okay.

37:16.165 --> 37:17.868
You know what, I'm gonna
have to find someone else

37:17.901 --> 37:19.669
to take to the Killers' concert.

37:20.904 --> 37:25.643
Wait, you're
going to the Killers' concert?

37:28.111 --> 37:30.547
No, look, this has
been really fun

37:30.580 --> 37:35.085
but this is my house, so,
thanks for stalking me home.

40:02.064 --> 40:04.700
Uh, I'm not sure
there is a next show.

40:04.734 --> 40:06.370
But you should see
her change a carburetor.

40:06.402 --> 40:07.605

I was kiddin'.

40:17.080 --> 40:18.782
Okay, Stella, what's going on?

40:18.814 --> 40:20.249
I'm worried about Chad.

40:20.283 --> 40:22.786
He's hanging out with Madison.

40:22.819 --> 40:24.121
What does he see in her?

40:24.154 --> 40:25.656
She's blonde and super hot.

40:25.689 --> 40:26.422
She's a cheerleader.

40:26.455 --> 40:27.423
They have nothing in common.

40:27.457 --> 40:29.859
Well, let's see, she's
manipulative, malicious,

40:29.893 --> 40:31.395
spiteful, and sexy, okay?

40:31.428 --> 40:33.063
I mean, I like it.

40:33.096 --> 40:35.866
She's a perfect first
ex-girlfriend experience.

40:38.768 --> 40:41.438
No reason to worry
about Chad, okay?

40:41.471 --> 40:42.339
Chicka chicka.

40:42.372 --> 40:43.306
Hey, Mo.

40:47.109 --> 40:48.144
Oh look, the band's here.

40:48.178 --> 40:49.746
All right if I hang?

40:49.779 --> 40:51.148
I'll get a ride home later.

41:02.792 --> 41:03.759
Quit calling us a band.

41:03.792 --> 41:05.761
Oh, okay, so what are you?

41:05.794 --> 41:06.762
A girl band.

41:07.931 --> 41:09.800
Okay, girl band.

41:09.832 --> 41:12.101

41:12.134 --> 41:14.805
Or are we chalking this
up as a one-time fluke?

41:14.837 --> 41:17.306
Okay, this was like at
least a two-time fluke.

41:17.339 --> 41:20.042
Fantastic and just go
on the rest of your lives

41:20.076 --> 41:23.347

could have been a star.

41:24.513 --> 41:25.415
Mmm?

41:28.218 --> 41:30.187
So, what's the plan, Dylan?

41:30.219 --> 41:31.187
Well, I'm glad you asked.

41:31.221 --> 41:33.056
You guys, I think that
it would be cool if...

41:36.158 --> 41:38.327
Oh, hey, Stella.

41:38.361 --> 41:39.462
Hi.

41:39.495 --> 41:41.831
Well, well, it's

41:50.839 --> 41:54.178

42:01.518 --> 42:04.955
Come on, let's grab
a seat for two.

42:04.988 --> 42:07.524
That's your friend, London.

42:07.556 --> 42:09.493
Well, what do you
want me to do, huh?

42:09.526 --> 42:10.861
Can you fix it?

42:11.995 --> 42:13.263
Sorry, Stella.

42:14.196 --> 42:15.364
You okay, Stella.

42:15.397 --> 42:17.166
I'm fine.

42:17.200 --> 42:19.268
So, I've got a proposal.

42:23.272 --> 42:26.209
I would like to
manage Drama Drama.

42:28.011 --> 42:29.246
Our manager, you?

42:29.279 --> 42:31.915
That's your big
plan for no regrets?

42:31.948 --> 42:33.049
Yes.

42:33.082 --> 42:36.185
Dude, if anyone should
manage Drama Drama, I should.

42:37.419 --> 42:38.087
Okay.

42:38.120 --> 42:40.890
So what would you do as manager?

42:42.024 --> 42:43.259
Mmm, say what?

42:43.292 --> 42:44.560
What's the plan?

42:44.593 --> 42:47.764
What's your vision
for Drama Drama.

42:48.832 --> 42:50.400
Oh, I...

42:50.433 --> 42:52.402
I'd...

42:52.435 --> 42:53.804
Managers don't need no vision.

42:53.837 --> 42:55.005
Ah.

42:55.038 --> 42:56.940
You got a vision
for us, Dylan?

42:56.973 --> 43:00.444
I want to promote a
Drama Drama concert.

43:02.312 --> 43:04.413
We can start by
spreading the word

43:04.446 --> 43:06.282
all over school.

43:06.315 --> 43:07.484
All right?

43:07.517 --> 43:10.419
We'll put posters
up all over town,

43:10.453 --> 43:11.388
build the buzz.

43:11.421 --> 43:14.491
Kids from Jefferson,
kids from Washington,

43:14.524 --> 43:16.426
and kids from Lincoln will come.

43:16.459 --> 43:20.797
And also, I wanna get record
companies to the show.

43:25.335 --> 43:26.570
What do you say?

43:27.870 --> 43:29.573
Come on, guys.

43:29.605 --> 43:30.473

I got a show booked for Drama
Drama at the Palace Theater

44:05.507 --> 44:06.609

weeks to practice

44:28.397 --> 44:30.499
So Dylan's got the girls

44:30.533 --> 44:32.969

gotta rise to the top.

44:34.603 --> 44:36.672
Practice makes perfect
and lazy will flop.

44:39.007 --> 44:40.377
Sorry but I call
'em as I see 'em.

44:40.410 --> 44:41.511
I don't follow, no, I lead 'em.

44:41.544 --> 44:43.513
They don't join us
then we beat 'em.

44:43.546 --> 44:45.649
And Drama's groove gotta deepen.

44:45.681 --> 44:47.651
But don't worry, you'll
see 'em on the big screen.

44:47.683 --> 44:48.584
Just don't get caught sleepin'.

44:50.719 --> 44:53.122
Chad, water.

44:53.156 --> 44:54.291
Oh.

45:00.497 --> 45:02.399
Come over to my house
after school today

45:02.431 --> 45:04.134
and setup my new computer.

45:04.167 --> 45:06.136
My mom will let you in.

45:06.169 --> 45:08.672
I have cheerleading practice.

45:08.705 --> 45:11.341
That way you can do my homework

45:11.373 --> 45:12.910
any time you want.

45:13.977 --> 45:15.612
I can't today.

45:15.645 --> 45:17.413
I have a Student
Council meeting.

45:17.446 --> 45:18.448
Oh please.

45:19.448 --> 45:21.417
You don't have to go to
stupid council meeting.

45:21.451 --> 45:24.621
It's not
stupid council meeting.

45:24.654 --> 45:25.622
It's Student Council meeting.

45:25.654 --> 45:26.989
- Chad!
- What?

45:39.201 --> 45:42.571
Okay, I guess I can
miss one meeting.

45:42.605 --> 45:44.440
We get along so well.

45:44.473 --> 45:49.011
Don't you think?

45:51.614 --> 45:53.583
I'll pick you up Friday night?

45:53.616 --> 45:54.584
What?

45:54.616 --> 45:56.986
It's just a date not the prom.

45:57.020 --> 45:59.122
Plus I haven't even offered
you my varsity jacket yet.

45:59.154 --> 46:01.457
Oh, like I'd be caught
dead in that thing.

46:08.096 --> 46:09.665
Gimme your phone.

46:09.698 --> 46:10.633
Hmm?

46:19.709 --> 46:20.643
Maybe.

46:28.785 --> 46:30.620
Hey, where's Chad?

46:30.652 --> 46:31.488
I don't know.

46:31.520 --> 46:32.756
Anybody see Chad?

46:32.788 --> 46:34.424
Have you seen him,
have you seen him?

46:34.457 --> 46:35.692
No, no, no.

46:35.725 --> 46:36.625
Moving on.

46:36.658 --> 46:37.493
Chad's not here.

46:38.660 --> 46:39.461
Hey, come on,

46:39.495 --> 46:40.797
look at the bright side.

46:40.830 --> 46:42.699
We've got a show
to get ready for.

46:45.134 --> 46:47.036
Mr. Chaudry called.

46:47.069 --> 46:49.238
He said that you
are failing math

46:49.272 --> 46:52.642
and that you're in
jeopardy of not graduating.

46:52.674 --> 46:53.642
Mom, I can explain.

46:53.676 --> 46:55.645
No, he also said that
he arranged for a tutor

46:55.678 --> 46:59.181
and you didn't show
up, surprise, surprise.

46:59.214 --> 47:00.816
Mom, you don't understand.

47:00.850 --> 47:04.120
It was Homecoming game
and I'm head cheerleader

47:04.152 --> 47:07.189
and then I had rehearsal and...

47:07.223 --> 47:08.658
Drama Drama's a hit, Mom.

47:08.690 --> 47:10.660
Maybe you should just quit
your little singing group.

47:10.692 --> 47:11.660
Please.

47:11.694 --> 47:13.663
You are a cheerleader

47:13.696 --> 47:14.663
not a pop star.

47:14.696 --> 47:19.035
You need to graduate and
go to a good college.

47:24.841 --> 47:26.142
Five,
six, seven, eight.

47:26.174 --> 47:29.144
Let's go Cougars.

47:29.178 --> 47:30.580
Let's go Cougars.

47:32.582 --> 47:33.415
Let's...

47:33.448 --> 47:34.717
Um, Miss Joy.

47:44.893 --> 47:45.796
Loser.

47:50.732 --> 47:52.167
Five,
six, seven, eight.

47:52.201 --> 47:55.305
Let's go Cougars.

47:55.337 --> 47:56.739
Let's go Cougars.

48:04.614 --> 48:05.882
Hey.

48:05.915 --> 48:07.117
Hey.

48:09.886 --> 48:11.721
Can I come in?

48:11.754 --> 48:13.623
Oh yeah, sorry.

48:29.906 --> 48:31.207
Your room's so...

48:31.239 --> 48:32.109
What?

48:35.777 --> 48:37.613
I just thought that there'd...

48:37.647 --> 48:40.350
You thought I'd have a
bunch of Math Club trophies.

48:40.382 --> 48:41.785
Yeah, kind of.

48:47.656 --> 48:49.258
Oh.

48:49.292 --> 48:53.228
Well, you're obviously
qualified to tutor me in math.

48:53.261 --> 48:56.765
So how did Chaudry
sucker you into this?

48:56.799 --> 48:58.501
Uh, honestly?

48:58.533 --> 48:59.768
No, lie to me.

49:01.270 --> 49:02.672
Um, well, um...

49:04.973 --> 49:07.643
It was kind of my idea.

49:07.676 --> 49:11.381
The way he teaches sucks and
I know you're not dumb so...

49:11.413 --> 49:12.848
How do you know I'm not dumb?

49:16.352 --> 49:17.286
Um...

49:19.355 --> 49:22.692
Look, I just think
you're, uh, amazing.

49:23.893 --> 49:24.794
Look, don't get me wrong.

49:24.826 --> 49:26.395
I know you'd never, you know.

49:26.428 --> 49:27.796
I just wanna help you with math

49:27.830 --> 49:31.368
and maybe get to know
you a little better.

49:34.837 --> 49:35.705
Hmm.

49:36.772 --> 49:38.274
Can I tell you something?

49:38.306 --> 49:40.276
Yeah, what's up?

49:40.308 --> 49:44.680
Okay, I've always kind
of had feelings for Chad.

49:44.714 --> 49:47.884
I just, I never had the
guts to say anything.

49:47.917 --> 49:51.888
And now I just can't stop
thinking about anything else.

49:51.921 --> 49:53.823
Okay, all right,
Stella, listen.

49:53.855 --> 49:56.625
You just gotta go up to Chad
and tell him how you feel.

49:56.658 --> 49:59.361
Okay, like how you
actually really feel

49:59.395 --> 50:00.897
deep down inside.

50:00.930 --> 50:02.832
- Okay, you're one to talk.
- You know what I mean?

50:02.864 --> 50:03.832
You are one to talk.

50:03.866 --> 50:04.968
What does that mean?

50:05.000 --> 50:07.736
Oh come on, I
know you like Mo.

50:08.738 --> 50:09.638
Wait, wait, wait.

50:09.672 --> 50:12.308
Okay, I think she's talented,

50:12.341 --> 50:14.310
very, very talented.

50:14.343 --> 50:17.379
I saw you look at her, I
see the way you talk to her.

50:17.413 --> 50:19.449
I mean, you being Drama
Drama's manager and all,

50:19.482 --> 50:21.250
it's pretty obvious.

50:23.051 --> 50:24.254
Do you think she knows?

50:25.421 --> 50:28.390
Uh, I might have
said something.

50:28.424 --> 50:29.392
Great, thank you for that.

50:29.424 --> 50:30.459
- Fantastic.
- I'm sorry.

50:30.493 --> 50:31.393
- No.
- Come on, Dylan,

50:31.426 --> 50:32.861
you just have to go up to her

50:32.895 --> 50:34.864
and tell her how you
feel, how you really feel

50:34.897 --> 50:36.332
down inside from your heart.

50:36.364 --> 50:37.667
Very funny.

50:37.700 --> 50:38.734
No, no, I can't do
that, all right?

50:38.768 --> 50:40.370
I'm the manager of the band.

50:40.402 --> 50:43.739
It will compromise our
entire business relationship.

50:43.772 --> 50:44.606
No.

50:44.640 --> 50:45.875
- No.
- Oh.

50:45.908 --> 50:47.676
The band's for now.

50:47.710 --> 50:48.778
Mo's forever.

50:50.980 --> 50:53.683
Fine.

50:53.716 --> 50:56.953
Okay, when you tell
Chad, I'll tell Mo.

50:56.986 --> 50:57.921
Deal?

50:58.788 --> 50:59.889
Deal.

51:02.058 --> 51:04.761
Here, use that trick
I showed you, FOIL.

51:04.794 --> 51:07.931
So it's first, outer,
then inner, last.

51:09.431 --> 51:11.901
So you start with the first
term and you make your way out

51:11.933 --> 51:12.968
and then you go...

51:13.002 --> 51:15.005
- To the inner part.
- Yes.

51:17.739 --> 51:20.676
So is the answer six x squared

51:22.444 --> 51:24.379
minus five x minus four?

51:24.413 --> 51:25.782
Yes, you got it.

51:27.482 --> 51:28.517
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah.

51:28.551 --> 51:29.384
That was awesome.

51:29.417 --> 51:30.652
Yeah.

51:30.685 --> 51:32.321
And that trick works
every time, so.

51:32.355 --> 51:33.023
Oh.

51:34.556 --> 51:39.094
I hate to say it but I
think I kinda like math.

51:39.127 --> 51:40.062
I don't believe you.

51:46.835 --> 51:49.839
Um, so again
tomorrow after school?

51:50.839 --> 51:52.341
Uh, yes, please.

51:53.109 --> 51:54.410
Cool.

51:54.442 --> 51:56.011
Cool.

51:56.044 --> 51:58.547
New song, ladies.

52:00.049 --> 52:01.751
Ooh, "Picture Perfect".

52:01.783 --> 52:03.085
I'm likin' the title.

52:03.118 --> 52:05.555
Stella, you take
the top verse.

54:08.176 --> 54:09.144
I need some air.

54:09.178 --> 54:10.946
I'll come with you.

54:10.980 --> 54:11.881
So I gotta tell you something

54:11.913 --> 54:13.549
but it has to stay between us.

54:13.582 --> 54:15.218
Of course.

54:15.250 --> 54:16.118
What's up?

54:17.185 --> 54:19.087
Jake Roberts asked me out.

54:19.120 --> 54:19.988
Shut up.

54:20.989 --> 54:22.257
Ooh and somebody in our band

54:22.290 --> 54:23.225
thinks he's hot.

54:23.259 --> 54:24.627
Yeah, I know.

54:26.127 --> 54:27.229
You know he's not my type.

54:27.263 --> 54:29.632
It's just he's been
kinda cool lately

54:29.665 --> 54:32.902
and he asked me to go to the
Killers' concert with him.

54:32.935 --> 54:34.103
Uh!

54:34.136 --> 54:35.103
You know what?

54:35.136 --> 54:36.238
Yeah, you're right, you
definitely shouldn't go

54:36.272 --> 54:37.172
but I volunteer as tribute.

54:37.205 --> 54:39.174
Oh.

54:39.207 --> 54:40.976
Okay, but you're
gonna go, right?

54:41.009 --> 54:42.111
I don't know.

54:42.143 --> 54:43.513
I mean, I told him
I'd think about it.

54:43.546 --> 54:46.982
It's just London is
so in love with him.

54:47.015 --> 54:48.917
It would crush her.

54:48.951 --> 54:52.989
Maybe you should just
talk to London about it.

54:53.022 --> 54:56.592
Maybe you could
talk to London for me.

54:56.625 --> 54:57.593
Yeah, right.

54:58.593 --> 55:00.296
I mean, yeah, London
is gonna be devastated

55:00.328 --> 55:04.667
but you have every right
to go out with Jake.

55:04.700 --> 55:06.134
I don't know.

55:06.167 --> 55:07.135
I just don't think I can.

55:08.036 --> 55:11.507
Four,
five, six, and seven.

55:13.042 --> 55:15.143
Someone answer that thing.

55:15.176 --> 55:16.745
Uh, I think it's
Sydney's phone.

55:16.779 --> 55:17.914
I'll get it.

55:19.781 --> 55:20.649
Hello.

55:22.250 --> 55:23.685
No, this isn't Sydney.

55:23.718 --> 55:24.720
Who is this?

55:27.790 --> 55:30.560
Jake?

55:30.593 --> 55:34.596
It's London, obviously.

55:36.332 --> 55:38.667
Why are you calling Sydney?

55:42.671 --> 55:43.573
Yeah.

55:44.672 --> 55:47.176
I'll be sure to
tell her you called.

55:47.209 --> 55:48.076
Mmm hmm.

55:54.082 --> 55:55.183
- I mean, I was like asking.
- He was like muah.

55:55.216 --> 55:57.319
Yes.

55:57.352 --> 55:59.354
Whoa, did somebody's
dog die or something?

56:01.290 --> 56:04.060
So you and Jake Roberts, huh?

56:04.093 --> 56:05.294
Wait, what?

56:05.328 --> 56:07.730
I answered your phone and
guess who was on the other end?

56:07.763 --> 56:10.700
Jake Roberts,
surprise, surprise.

56:10.732 --> 56:12.067
You remember Jake, right?

56:12.100 --> 56:13.736
The guy who was not your type.

56:13.768 --> 56:15.071
The guy who's not hot.

56:15.103 --> 56:16.372
The guy who's supposed
to be my boyfriend.

56:16.404 --> 56:18.575
Wait, your boyfriend?

56:19.841 --> 56:23.078
You know, and why are you
even answering my phone?

56:23.111 --> 56:24.680
London, you should know that
Sydney wasn't even gonna...

56:24.712 --> 56:25.680
Shut up!

56:25.714 --> 56:28.116
This doesn't even concern you.

56:29.384 --> 56:31.020
I'm outta this stupid band.

56:31.786 --> 56:33.689
Such a dumb idea.

56:33.721 --> 56:36.959
I gave up cheerleading
for you losers.

56:36.991 --> 56:37.959
I'm sure there's
a way we can...

56:37.993 --> 56:39.094
Stella, this isn't your silly

56:39.127 --> 56:41.096
Student Council, okay?

56:41.129 --> 56:43.832
No, Stella, let her leave.

56:43.866 --> 56:45.701
We don't need her.

56:45.734 --> 56:49.238
Did you think that
I wouldn't find out?

56:49.270 --> 56:53.709
Was it some sort of
secret between all of you?

56:58.346 --> 56:59.281
Okay.

57:09.757 --> 57:12.127
What are we gonna do now?

57:12.160 --> 57:14.062
We have a show in a week.

Chad.

59:24.560 --> 59:25.495
Do you guys need a hand?

59:25.527 --> 59:28.930
Hey, where's your
demonic girlfriend, huh?

59:28.964 --> 59:30.967
She's in the bathroom.

59:33.902 --> 59:36.539
Chad is this even?

59:36.571 --> 59:39.207
Yeah, maybe a little
up on the right.

59:39.241 --> 59:40.176
All right.

59:40.209 --> 59:44.013
We missed you at the
Student Council meeting.

59:44.046 --> 59:46.015
Yeah, I was just...

59:46.047 --> 59:46.948
- Mmm.
- You know,

59:46.982 --> 59:49.218
just stuff happened, you know.

59:49.250 --> 59:51.286
Um, was Stella there?

59:51.319 --> 59:54.556
Well, she's the vice
president so I would think so.

59:54.589 --> 59:56.292
She was wondering where
you were actually.

59:56.325 --> 59:59.594
And why are you asking
about Stella, huh?

59:59.627 --> 1:00:00.962
'Cause she's my...

1:00:00.995 --> 1:00:02.030
What?

1:00:02.064 --> 1:00:03.431
- My best friend?
- Mmm.

1:00:04.600 --> 1:00:07.303
Who can tell me how to
solve the following equation?

1:00:07.335 --> 1:00:08.203
Sydney?

1:00:09.638 --> 1:00:11.340
Oh, I got three?

1:00:15.277 --> 1:00:17.013
Is that your answer?

1:00:18.346 --> 1:00:19.214
Three x?

1:00:22.283 --> 1:00:25.520
London, let me guess,
you got three x as well.

1:00:25.553 --> 1:00:28.056
No, actually,

1:00:28.089 --> 1:00:31.493
I got y equals x
minus one over three?

1:00:35.230 --> 1:00:38.067
That is correct, Miss Collin.

1:00:39.567 --> 1:00:43.038
I don't suppose you can
show us how you got that?

1:00:49.645 --> 1:00:53.015
So one equals
three x plus one.

1:00:53.047 --> 1:00:54.616
Then you interchange
the x and the y

1:00:54.649 --> 1:00:58.353
so therefore it's x
equals three y plus one.

1:00:58.386 --> 1:01:01.022
And then you solve for
y and then x minus one

1:01:01.056 --> 1:01:02.958
is equal to three y.

1:01:02.991 --> 1:01:07.563
And from there you do y
equals x minus one over three.

1:01:08.696 --> 1:01:10.932
Very good.

1:01:20.542 --> 1:01:23.312
Well, you're a quick learner.

1:01:23.344 --> 1:01:24.379
You're a good tutor.

1:01:24.413 --> 1:01:26.315
I'll see you after school.

1:01:26.348 --> 1:01:28.084
Hey, we should talk.

1:01:32.620 --> 1:01:33.655
Three?

1:01:33.689 --> 1:01:36.125
When I doubt say three.

1:01:36.158 --> 1:01:38.928
And if that doesn't
work say three x?

1:01:38.960 --> 1:01:39.661
Bingo.

1:01:41.363 --> 1:01:42.565
So are we on?

1:01:46.100 --> 1:01:47.535
Outside.

1:01:51.439 --> 1:01:52.307
So?

1:01:53.107 --> 1:01:54.442
I'm not going.

1:01:58.446 --> 1:01:59.614
You know, I never would've
pegged you as the type

1:01:59.647 --> 1:02:02.417
to care about what
other people think.

1:02:02.451 --> 1:02:04.086
That's not it.

1:02:04.118 --> 1:02:05.553
Look, is it so hard
for you to believe

1:02:05.587 --> 1:02:07.355
that someone might not wanna
go out with Jake Roberts?

1:02:07.388 --> 1:02:10.024
I don't need you
to spell it out.

1:02:10.058 --> 1:02:11.293
I really like you, Sydney.

1:02:13.395 --> 1:02:15.163
I like you a lot, okay?

1:02:15.196 --> 1:02:16.564
I don't know what
it is about you.

1:02:16.598 --> 1:02:18.734
I mean, you're just
not like everyone else.

1:02:18.767 --> 1:02:19.701
And I think it's crazy

1:02:19.734 --> 1:02:21.102
we both wanna go to
the Killers' concert.

1:02:21.136 --> 1:02:23.038
I mean, how cool is that?

1:02:23.071 --> 1:02:24.707
And just so you know, I'm
not gonna bring London

1:02:24.739 --> 1:02:26.442
if you don't go.

1:02:26.475 --> 1:02:29.444
London's a friend, nothing more.

1:02:29.477 --> 1:02:30.578
Okay?

1:02:30.611 --> 1:02:32.080
So please just think about it.

1:02:32.114 --> 1:02:33.950
It'll be so much fun.

1:02:43.759 --> 1:02:45.995
I was nice enough
to pick up her phone.

1:02:46.027 --> 1:02:46.995
What if she answered?

1:02:47.029 --> 1:02:48.464
Would she still talk to him?

1:02:48.497 --> 1:02:50.065
What does Jake see in her?

1:02:50.098 --> 1:02:52.067
Oh, and the best part,
your boyfriend's gal pal,

1:02:52.100 --> 1:02:54.670
little Miss Sunshine,
tried to defend her.

1:02:54.703 --> 1:02:55.771
So no more Drama Drama?

1:02:55.803 --> 1:02:57.472
Don't know, don't
care, I'm out.

1:02:57.506 --> 1:02:59.475
I can't believe Jake.

1:02:59.507 --> 1:03:00.676
Don't worry.

1:03:00.709 --> 1:03:05.982
I've got something planned
for Jake and that Sydney girl.

1:03:08.649 --> 1:03:09.651
No yogurt?

1:03:14.122 --> 1:03:17.091
Listen, okay, you
guys have worked so hard

1:03:17.125 --> 1:03:19.361
and you're really ready for
this break of a lifetime.

1:03:19.393 --> 1:03:21.696
Okay, Veronica, you
still wanna do this.

1:03:21.730 --> 1:03:23.498
I'm not the problem.

1:03:23.531 --> 1:03:25.767
London is our choreographer.

1:03:25.801 --> 1:03:28.370
Plus I was finally
starting to like her, too.

1:03:28.402 --> 1:03:29.705
And she ain't in.

1:03:29.738 --> 1:03:30.906
Mo, you...

1:03:30.939 --> 1:03:34.109
Ooh, looks like being a
band manager kinda sucks, huh?

1:03:34.142 --> 1:03:35.444
I have to tell you something.

1:03:35.477 --> 1:03:35.978
Would you promise

1:03:36.011 --> 1:03:37.513
not to say anything?

1:03:37.546 --> 1:03:38.080
Hmm?

1:03:38.113 --> 1:03:40.515
You have to promise.

1:03:40.549 --> 1:03:41.650
Okay.

1:03:41.683 --> 1:03:42.551
I promise.

1:03:44.185 --> 1:03:45.086
I promise.

1:03:50.759 --> 1:03:52.795
London didn't want
me to tell you this

1:03:52.828 --> 1:03:54.830
but I think you should know.

1:03:54.863 --> 1:03:56.064
Your friend Stella thinks

1:03:56.098 --> 1:03:59.802
that you're a little, pathetic,
immature, friendless loser.

1:03:59.835 --> 1:04:03.172
She says that you can't even
tie your shoelaces without her.

1:04:03.205 --> 1:04:04.473
She's always complaining

1:04:04.506 --> 1:04:05.674
about how she needs
to be your mother

1:04:05.707 --> 1:04:09.078
and she said that that shirt
makes you look like a grape.

1:04:09.111 --> 1:04:09.812
A grape?

1:04:09.844 --> 1:04:11.547
I know.

1:04:11.580 --> 1:04:14.683
Stella's not the perfect
little angel you think she is.

1:04:14.716 --> 1:04:16.551
You know, we really should
just try to be positive.

1:04:16.585 --> 1:04:18.153
Exactly.

1:04:18.185 --> 1:04:19.555
You guys have all this
talent and the star power

1:04:19.587 --> 1:04:21.223
and then this one little
hiccup comes along

1:04:21.256 --> 1:04:22.825
and it's just gonna be over?

1:04:22.857 --> 1:04:24.826
It feels like you're
giving up on the show

1:04:24.859 --> 1:04:27.695
that could launch your
entire careers, guys.

1:04:27.728 --> 1:04:30.431
Look, I ain't giving
up on show biz, dude.

1:04:30.464 --> 1:04:32.700
But this Drama Drama
thing, however, is over.

1:04:32.734 --> 1:04:35.703
Do the show
without London, okay?

1:04:35.736 --> 1:04:37.705
Little a reminder, honey,

1:04:37.739 --> 1:04:40.576
you promise you
wouldn't tell anyone.

1:04:40.609 --> 1:04:43.712
The most important
thing you need to know,

1:04:43.745 --> 1:04:47.248
I don't agree with
anything London says ever!

1:04:47.281 --> 1:04:50.819
And sometimes I don't
even really like her.

1:04:54.256 --> 1:04:57.093
Remember you
promised, boyfriend.

1:04:58.759 --> 1:05:00.895
Anyone is replaceable
in show biz.

1:05:00.928 --> 1:05:01.896
All right, if we
don't do the show,

1:05:01.930 --> 1:05:03.732
believe me the Palace
Theater

1:05:03.765 --> 1:05:06.734
will book someone even if
they're not as good as you.

1:05:06.768 --> 1:05:09.204
You guys gotta go for this one.

1:05:09.236 --> 1:05:11.339
What do you say?

1:05:15.643 --> 1:05:17.745
Hey, there's Sydney and maybe
she can just talk to London

1:05:17.779 --> 1:05:19.748
and figure this all out for us.

1:05:19.781 --> 1:05:22.217
Yeah, they really
just gotta work it out.

1:05:22.250 --> 1:05:24.920
Look what just walked in.

1:05:27.288 --> 1:05:28.524
Watch this.

1:05:39.267 --> 1:05:41.502
Did you guys see that?

1:05:41.535 --> 1:05:43.304
Oh she is dead!

1:05:43.337 --> 1:05:44.772

And after all the
success of Drama Drama

1:08:49.858 --> 1:08:51.360
this is the last place
I expected to see you

1:08:51.393 --> 1:08:53.362
for of all things
fighting no less.

1:08:53.394 --> 1:08:54.696
You know this is a disgrace

1:08:54.729 --> 1:08:57.032
for a supposed
anti-bullying role model.

1:08:57.064 --> 1:08:58.165
I am sorry, Miss Macy,

1:08:58.200 --> 1:09:00.434
- but Madison is the one...
- I don't wanna hear it, okay?

1:09:00.468 --> 1:09:02.837
Because it's all
over social media.

1:09:02.871 --> 1:09:04.773
You have embarrassed this school

1:09:04.805 --> 1:09:06.507
and tarnished our
reputation as a leader

1:09:06.541 --> 1:09:08.010
in this community.

1:09:14.549 --> 1:09:15.984
Look at me.

1:09:16.017 --> 1:09:17.853
It pains me to do this

1:09:17.885 --> 1:09:19.487
but you will report
for detention

1:09:19.520 --> 1:09:21.156
after school every
day this week.

1:09:21.188 --> 1:09:22.990
- No, detention?
- Yes.

1:09:23.023 --> 1:09:24.191
You heard me.

1:09:24.224 --> 1:09:26.460
And now, of course, I'm gonna
have to call your father.

1:09:32.099 --> 1:09:34.135
Look, these exponential
logarithmic functions

1:09:34.169 --> 1:09:35.069
aren't that hard.

1:09:35.103 --> 1:09:36.538
I mean, you know, if you focus,

1:09:36.571 --> 1:09:37.605
you'll breeze right through 'em.

1:09:37.639 --> 1:09:39.474
I know, I'm...

1:09:39.506 --> 1:09:43.812
I'm sorry, I just,
maybe I should go home.

1:09:43.845 --> 1:09:45.881
Look, something's wrong.

1:09:45.913 --> 1:09:46.915
I'm fine.

1:09:49.216 --> 1:09:51.152
Everything is wrong.

1:09:51.185 --> 1:09:52.420
I got into a fight with Sydney

1:09:52.453 --> 1:09:54.822
and I quit the band.

1:09:54.855 --> 1:09:56.023
And then I quit cheerleading

1:09:56.056 --> 1:09:57.893
and Madison got into
a fight with Sydney

1:09:57.925 --> 1:09:58.893
and that's my fault.

1:09:58.926 --> 1:09:59.827
And Madison's seeing Chad

1:09:59.862 --> 1:10:02.197
and I'm failing math
and nobody likes me.

1:10:03.197 --> 1:10:04.031
Are you laughing at me?

1:10:04.065 --> 1:10:05.901
- No.
- Why are you laughing at me?

1:10:05.934 --> 1:10:08.103
That's literally the worst
thing anyone could do right now.

1:10:08.135 --> 1:10:09.904
Why are you laughing at me?

1:10:09.938 --> 1:10:10.873
Great.

1:10:12.072 --> 1:10:15.576
I like you a lot,
London, like a lot.

1:10:16.944 --> 1:10:19.514
You're beautiful and talented

1:10:19.546 --> 1:10:24.118
and smart and funny and if
Jake Roberts can't see that

1:10:24.152 --> 1:10:25.554
then that's his loss.

1:10:25.586 --> 1:10:28.189
Jake
doesn't know I'm alive.

1:10:28.223 --> 1:10:29.658
He treats me like
his little sister.

1:10:29.690 --> 1:10:30.524
London.

1:10:30.558 --> 1:10:31.859
What?

1:10:31.893 --> 1:10:35.464
Jake Roberts is not
the only guy in school.

1:10:44.104 --> 1:10:45.540
Pump,
pump, pump it up.

1:10:45.572 --> 1:10:47.209
Pump,
pump, pump it up.

1:10:47.242 --> 1:10:48.810
Pump that
Cougar spirit up.

1:10:48.843 --> 1:10:50.144
Pump
that Cougar spirit up.

1:10:50.178 --> 1:10:52.214
Hey, Madison.

1:10:56.117 --> 1:10:58.887
What do you want, Rex?

1:10:58.920 --> 1:10:59.955
Nice shiner.

1:10:59.987 --> 1:11:01.155
It's a turn-on.

1:11:01.188 --> 1:11:02.123
Stop.

1:11:03.125 --> 1:11:03.959
Hey, my parents are
out of town this weekend

1:11:03.992 --> 1:11:07.095
and I'm having a
party Saturday night.

1:11:07.127 --> 1:11:08.563
But I'm sure with your
black eye and all,

1:11:08.595 --> 1:11:11.966
you're not interested
in being my date, right?

1:11:14.602 --> 1:11:16.238
I don't miss parties, Rex.

1:11:16.270 --> 1:11:17.906
I'll be there,

1:11:17.938 --> 1:11:20.142
looking hot, shiner and all.

1:11:23.144 --> 1:11:23.979
Shoo shoo.

1:11:24.011 --> 1:11:25.514
All right.

1:11:27.215 --> 1:11:28.016
Madison.

1:11:29.017 --> 1:11:31.586
I need to talk to you.

1:11:31.618 --> 1:11:32.720
Not here.

1:11:36.657 --> 1:11:38.259
Coach, I'll be right back.

1:11:50.237 --> 1:11:52.006
Hey.

1:11:52.040 --> 1:11:52.908
Hey.

1:11:53.875 --> 1:11:56.011
Don't you have something
better to be doing?

1:11:56.044 --> 1:11:58.747
Thought I'd come
share in the misery.

1:11:58.779 --> 1:12:00.014
Look, it's the least I could do.

1:12:00.047 --> 1:12:02.017
I mean, I am the reason
that you're here.

1:12:02.050 --> 1:12:03.151
No, you're not.

1:12:04.318 --> 1:12:05.286
Look, I've been
looking for a reason

1:12:05.319 --> 1:12:08.023
to beat on that bully
bitch since Homecoming.

1:12:09.357 --> 1:12:11.026
When she knocked you
down I got my chance.

1:12:11.059 --> 1:12:12.627
Oh my gosh, you should've
seen her in class today.

1:12:12.660 --> 1:12:14.229
She was wearing sunglasses.

1:12:14.261 --> 1:12:15.630
You got her so good.

1:12:15.662 --> 1:12:16.630
No, shut up.

1:12:16.663 --> 1:12:18.166
Yeah, like huge.

1:12:18.198 --> 1:12:19.033
There was a bruise.

1:12:19.067 --> 1:12:19.935
Oh.

1:12:20.734 --> 1:12:22.036
Oh my God.

1:12:23.071 --> 1:12:24.238
Oh.

1:12:24.272 --> 1:12:25.172
Come on now hit 'em,

1:12:25.206 --> 1:12:27.042
get 'em, there he is.

1:12:27.075 --> 1:12:27.776
There, get him.

1:12:27.809 --> 1:12:28.643
There you go.

1:12:28.675 --> 1:12:29.710
There you go.

1:12:32.212 --> 1:12:35.584
You know, you really
should go out with Jake.

1:12:35.617 --> 1:12:36.618
He's so hot.

1:12:38.286 --> 1:12:39.654
I know.

1:12:39.687 --> 1:12:41.189
Oh!

1:12:41.221 --> 1:12:42.357
- No, I know.
- What?

1:12:42.389 --> 1:12:43.325
I hate it.

1:12:43.358 --> 1:12:44.659
- Stop it.
- You said it.

1:12:44.692 --> 1:12:45.794
He's actually
like a gentleman.

1:12:45.827 --> 1:12:46.661
You said it.

1:12:46.694 --> 1:12:47.661
- But he's hot.
- Dude, but you said it.

1:12:47.694 --> 1:12:48.596
I know.

1:12:48.630 --> 1:12:49.331
You like him.

1:12:49.363 --> 1:12:50.931
- I know!
- Aw, I knew it!

1:12:50.965 --> 1:12:51.632
Don't tell anyone.

1:12:51.666 --> 1:12:52.667
Well, you thought he was hot

1:12:52.700 --> 1:12:53.801
and you liked him.

1:12:53.835 --> 1:12:55.069
- Everybody, Sydney
- No!

1:12:55.103 --> 1:12:56.071
- loves Jake, everyone.
- Hey, hey, hey.

1:12:56.104 --> 1:12:57.272
- Yo.
- Love, whoa.

1:12:59.040 --> 1:13:00.809
Oh my God, wait, come here.

1:13:00.841 --> 1:13:02.076
Come here, come here, come here.

1:13:02.109 --> 1:13:05.046
I should
sue that bitch.

1:13:06.848 --> 1:13:09.718
Um, Madison, you started it.

1:13:11.251 --> 1:13:12.353
And to be honest, I wish you
didn't knock her tray down

1:13:12.386 --> 1:13:15.090
because that makes me look bad,

1:13:15.122 --> 1:13:16.290
like I asked you to do it

1:13:16.323 --> 1:13:17.358
and it makes us
both look guilty.

1:13:17.392 --> 1:13:18.393
London.

1:13:18.425 --> 1:13:21.095
I told you I'd take care of it.

1:13:21.129 --> 1:13:22.397
Show me some love here.

1:13:22.429 --> 1:13:26.233
You're my friend and
I'd do anything for you.

1:13:26.267 --> 1:13:29.037
Actually, you're
more than a friend.

1:13:29.069 --> 1:13:30.705
You're like a real sister to me.

1:13:30.737 --> 1:13:32.039
I mean if someone

1:13:32.072 --> 1:13:33.240
- stole my boyfriend
- Very Shakespeare.

1:13:33.273 --> 1:13:34.108
- I'd like you to do the same.
- More like

1:13:34.142 --> 1:13:35.242
"Young and the Restless".

1:13:35.276 --> 1:13:36.711
Well, reality check, Madison.

1:13:36.743 --> 1:13:38.246
Jake is not my boyfriend.

1:13:38.278 --> 1:13:39.413
I mean, you said it yourself.

1:13:39.447 --> 1:13:40.782
He's just not into me.

1:13:40.814 --> 1:13:42.250
How do you know?

1:13:42.282 --> 1:13:43.751
What if Sydney wasn't
in the picture?

1:13:43.785 --> 1:13:45.787
I mean that kinda
girl would do anything

1:13:45.819 --> 1:13:47.322
to get a boy.

1:13:47.354 --> 1:13:49.657
Yeah well, that's
what I thought at first.

1:13:49.690 --> 1:13:50.724
But I mean I've
gotten to know her

1:13:50.757 --> 1:13:53.127
- and she's not...
- Stop!

1:13:53.161 --> 1:13:58.065
Are you actually?

1:13:58.099 --> 1:13:58.834
What?

1:14:00.100 --> 1:14:01.268
You're on Sydney's side.

1:14:01.301 --> 1:14:02.437
I can't believe this!

1:14:02.470 --> 1:14:04.139
Okay, you need to relax.

1:14:04.171 --> 1:14:05.005
I'm just saying

1:14:05.040 --> 1:14:06.241
- that Sydney's not the...
- You know what?

1:14:06.273 --> 1:14:10.277
Rex invited me as his date to
his party on Saturday night.

1:14:10.310 --> 1:14:12.080
That makes it my party.

1:14:12.112 --> 1:14:14.081
If any of those Drama
Drama freaks show up,

1:14:14.114 --> 1:14:15.450
- I swear on I'm gonna...
- I'm sorry, wait,

1:14:15.483 --> 1:14:17.452
did you say Rex?

1:14:17.484 --> 1:14:19.754
What about Chad?

1:14:19.787 --> 1:14:21.289
Right.

1:14:21.322 --> 1:14:22.791
I need to get rid of him fast.

1:14:25.926 --> 1:14:27.161
I thought you liked Chad.

1:14:27.194 --> 1:14:30.297
Well, he finished my
senior English paper.

1:14:30.331 --> 1:14:31.833
I think I'm over him.

1:14:31.866 --> 1:14:34.803
Are you coming back
to cheerleading?

1:14:36.470 --> 1:14:39.741
I'm gonna be late
for math tutoring.

1:14:40.474 --> 1:14:41.343
I gotta go.

1:14:46.214 --> 1:14:47.782
Math tutoring?

1:14:47.814 --> 1:14:50.184
So Madison's been using Chad?

1:14:50.218 --> 1:14:51.786
What a trash human.

1:14:51.818 --> 1:14:53.187
We have to tell Stella.

1:14:53.220 --> 1:14:54.455
Trash human.

1:14:54.488 --> 1:14:55.357
Sydney!

1:14:56.823 --> 1:14:59.193
What are you doing here?

1:14:59.227 --> 1:15:01.328
You're not on the
detention list.

1:15:01.362 --> 1:15:04.199
Go, leave your friend alone
to do the time for the crime.

1:15:04.232 --> 1:15:07.202
This is supposed to be
solitary confinement.

1:15:07.234 --> 1:15:08.402
Like a dungeon.

1:15:08.435 --> 1:15:10.938
You know, I just came here
to do the time with Veronica

1:15:10.971 --> 1:15:12.206
because she had my back.

1:15:12.239 --> 1:15:13.140
You know what I mean?

1:15:13.174 --> 1:15:14.408
That's loyalty.

1:15:14.442 --> 1:15:16.845
Is there a rule against loyalty?

1:15:16.877 --> 1:15:20.348
I mean, she just
stood up to a bully.

1:15:20.380 --> 1:15:21.716
Is that true?

1:15:24.251 --> 1:15:26.420
I don't condone fighting,

1:15:26.453 --> 1:15:28.857
but loyalty is a rare trait.

1:15:32.260 --> 1:15:33.161
Go, both of you.

1:15:33.193 --> 1:15:33.894
Really?

1:15:33.928 --> 1:15:34.895
- Yes, go, run!
- That worked.

1:15:36.264 --> 1:15:37.364
- Run.
- Go, go, go!

1:15:37.398 --> 1:15:39.534
With the wind at your back.

1:15:39.567 --> 1:15:40.835
- While you can still
- Come on.

1:15:40.867 --> 1:15:41.435
- Keep on it.
- make it to Broadway.

1:15:41.469 --> 1:15:43.238
Wait, that's me.

1:15:44.272 --> 1:15:45.239
Oh great.

1:15:45.273 --> 1:15:46.875
My well-meaning mother.

1:15:46.907 --> 1:15:48.375
Oh she's gonna get it.

1:15:48.408 --> 1:15:49.277
Hi, Mom.

1:15:50.411 --> 1:15:51.980
Are you
sure she said that?

1:15:52.013 --> 1:15:53.381
I mean, exactly that?

1:15:53.413 --> 1:15:54.448
Yes!

1:15:54.482 --> 1:15:56.251
You've
gotta tell Chad.

1:15:56.283 --> 1:15:58.519
Why would Madison do that?

1:15:58.553 --> 1:16:00.287
It's in her genes.

1:16:01.288 --> 1:16:02.924
He's in her jeans?

1:16:05.225 --> 1:16:07.127
Guys, what the, no!

1:16:07.161 --> 1:16:08.263
No.

1:16:08.295 --> 1:16:10.197
That's not, that's
not what I meant.

1:16:10.230 --> 1:16:11.866
Yes, you're totally
gonna ace this test.

1:16:11.898 --> 1:16:16.904
Well, if I do,
Leo, it's because of you.

1:16:17.971 --> 1:16:19.808
Do you always wear
those glasses?

1:16:19.840 --> 1:16:23.310
Well, I'm kind of
blind without 'em, so.

1:16:30.585 --> 1:16:33.020
You have really
beautiful eyes.

1:16:34.188 --> 1:16:35.556
You should get contacts.

1:16:35.590 --> 1:16:38.426
Or, you know, that laser thing.

1:16:38.459 --> 1:16:41.296
I'm assuming you
don't have hair gel.

1:16:41.328 --> 1:16:42.197
No.

1:16:51.339 --> 1:16:52.907
What are you doing?

1:16:52.939 --> 1:16:55.844
Leo, you know
math, I know hair.

word for it I guess.

1:18:21.028 --> 1:18:24.666
We should go over
rational root theorem.

1:18:24.698 --> 1:18:26.134
The test is tomorrow.

1:18:26.166 --> 1:18:27.535
Stop foiling around.

1:18:28.568 --> 1:18:30.037
Is that your first math joke?

1:18:31.438 --> 1:18:33.540
Yeah, I'm
learning.

1:18:33.573 --> 1:18:35.042
All right, number 14?

1:18:35.076 --> 1:18:36.077
Mmm hmm.

1:18:40.380 --> 1:18:41.515
Good afternoon.

1:18:41.549 --> 1:18:44.419
As you all know, tomorrow
our undefeated football team

1:18:44.452 --> 1:18:46.421
is playing Jefferson High.

1:18:47.388 --> 1:18:48.422
Ooh, I meant...

1:18:51.192 --> 1:18:53.060
Reminder to all
students participating

1:18:53.094 --> 1:18:54.562
in our pep rally today.

1:18:54.595 --> 1:18:58.433
Last period classes
have been canceled.

1:19:00.334 --> 1:19:02.103
So when you hear the
bell, make your way

1:19:02.135 --> 1:19:06.974
immediately to the gymnasium
and show your school spirit.

1:19:15.616 --> 1:19:18.987
Shouldn't you head on over
to the pep rally, Miss Collin?

1:19:19.019 --> 1:19:21.989
I have a favor to
ask, Mr. Chaudry.

1:19:22.023 --> 1:19:24.626
Can you please
grade my test now.

1:19:30.665 --> 1:19:34.102
At wide receiver,
number 81, Rex Harris.

1:19:37.772 --> 1:19:38.739
Woo woo woo.

1:19:38.773 --> 1:19:41.676
Woo woo woo woo
woo woo woo woo woo woo

1:19:41.709 --> 1:19:42.777
woo woo woo.

1:19:42.809 --> 1:19:46.080
At tailback, number
54, Willy Norm.

1:19:48.715 --> 1:19:52.620
Woo woo woo woo
woo woo woo woo woo woo.

1:19:52.653 --> 1:19:54.689
And at quarterback,

1:19:54.721 --> 1:19:57.992
our captain, number
12, Jake Roberts.

1:20:01.461 --> 1:20:03.430
Jake, Jake.

1:20:03.464 --> 1:20:04.165
Yeah.

1:20:04.197 --> 1:20:05.098
Look mean.

1:20:05.131 --> 1:20:06.500
Ha ha!

1:20:06.533 --> 1:20:08.502
Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake.

1:20:08.536 --> 1:20:10.371
Jake, get up here, you animal.

1:20:10.403 --> 1:20:11.406
Get up here.

1:20:14.207 --> 1:20:16.044
Okay, here it goes.

1:20:19.746 --> 1:20:21.248
Hey, JFK Cougars!

1:20:22.817 --> 1:20:26.054
Woo woo woo woo
woo woo woo woo woo woo.

1:20:26.086 --> 1:20:27.821
Hey, can we talk?

1:20:27.854 --> 1:20:29.523
Right now?

1:20:29.556 --> 1:20:30.492
Yeah, can we go outside?

1:20:30.524 --> 1:20:34.228
Jake, Jake,
Jake, Jake, Jake, woo!

1:20:41.836 --> 1:20:42.704
London.

1:20:46.706 --> 1:20:48.175
That's a 92.

1:20:48.209 --> 1:20:50.678
Excellent work, Miss Collin.

1:20:50.711 --> 1:20:52.213
Congratulations.

1:20:52.246 --> 1:20:57.252
Thank you.

1:21:00.888 --> 1:21:03.157
Teacher of the year.

1:21:04.591 --> 1:21:05.826
Go, Jake.

1:21:05.859 --> 1:21:08.729
Last year,
Jefferson defeated us.

1:21:09.897 --> 1:21:11.232
This year,

1:21:11.264 --> 1:21:12.200
- we are undefeated!
- Check it out.

1:21:12.233 --> 1:21:13.101
- What?
- Woo, woo.

1:21:13.134 --> 1:21:13.835
What, this is amazing.

1:21:13.867 --> 1:21:15.169
Jefferson is

1:21:15.202 --> 1:21:15.770
- also undefeated.
- How'd you get it

1:21:15.803 --> 1:21:17.171
back this fast?

1:21:17.203 --> 1:21:18.171
- And on this Saturday
- Well, I kind of

1:21:18.205 --> 1:21:19.573
- refused to leave
- only one team

1:21:19.607 --> 1:21:21.175
- will be left standing.
- until Chaudry graded it.

1:21:21.207 --> 1:21:22.576
JFK High!

1:21:28.616 --> 1:21:30.718
I wanna celebrate with you.

1:21:30.751 --> 1:21:31.886
Woo woo woo

1:21:31.919 --> 1:21:33.587
- woo woo woo.
- Come by my house tonight.

1:21:33.621 --> 1:21:35.824
It's gonna be a late night.

1:21:37.757 --> 1:21:39.894
We will bring the title home!

1:21:42.362 --> 1:21:45.566
Woo woo
woo woo woo woo woo.

1:21:47.768 --> 1:21:50.270
Woo woo
woo woo woo woo.

1:21:50.304 --> 1:21:51.272
Stella.

1:21:51.304 --> 1:21:52.606
Just come with me please.

1:21:52.639 --> 1:21:54.843
I need to talk to you, okay?

1:21:58.912 --> 1:22:02.750
Chad, I haven't spoken
to you in so long

1:22:02.782 --> 1:22:03.750
and I just wanted to talk

1:22:03.783 --> 1:22:05.286
- to you about something.
- What are you doing?

1:22:05.318 --> 1:22:07.522
I'm fixing your collar.

1:22:08.922 --> 1:22:10.757
I miss you.

1:22:10.791 --> 1:22:14.129
I miss talking to
you about everything.

1:22:15.328 --> 1:22:17.564
Do you like Madison?

1:22:17.598 --> 1:22:18.765
What?

1:22:18.799 --> 1:22:20.902
Do you
actually like her?

1:22:20.934 --> 1:22:23.770
She's my girlfriend.

1:22:23.804 --> 1:22:26.239
Yeah, I know, I just...

1:22:26.273 --> 1:22:27.308
It's like you're a
completely different person

1:22:27.340 --> 1:22:28.308
now that you're with her.

1:22:29.809 --> 1:22:30.844
I never see you
anymore and when I do,

1:22:30.877 --> 1:22:32.947
you're always with Madison

1:22:32.979 --> 1:22:34.314
and ditch Student Council

1:22:34.348 --> 1:22:36.783
and everybody says
you're whipped.

1:22:36.817 --> 1:22:38.319
Whipped?

1:22:38.352 --> 1:22:39.653
Yeah, like you're not
thinking with your brain.

1:22:39.687 --> 1:22:42.256
You're thinking with
your other brain.

1:22:42.288 --> 1:22:44.524
So what's wrong with that?

1:22:44.558 --> 1:22:47.929
I just never had
anyone like me so much.

1:22:47.961 --> 1:22:50.165
But we're best friends.

1:22:51.698 --> 1:22:52.634
So?

1:22:54.001 --> 1:22:56.304
You're not my girlfriend.

1:22:57.837 --> 1:22:59.706
Yeah, I know, I know.

1:23:01.308 --> 1:23:02.276
Look, I didn't
bring you out here

1:23:02.309 --> 1:23:04.312
because I wanna hurt you.

1:23:04.345 --> 1:23:05.246
I just...

1:23:07.014 --> 1:23:08.282
I know you, okay?

1:23:08.314 --> 1:23:09.416
And Madison isn't right for you.

1:23:09.450 --> 1:23:10.818
And I just wanna
take care of you.

1:23:10.850 --> 1:23:11.751
Stella, Stella.

1:23:11.786 --> 1:23:12.953
- You don't have to
- I'm your best friend.

1:23:12.987 --> 1:23:14.422
- I just...
- take care of me.

1:23:14.455 --> 1:23:15.689
You're not my mom.

1:23:15.723 --> 1:23:17.225
I can tie my own shoes.

1:23:17.257 --> 1:23:17.992
What?

1:23:18.024 --> 1:23:20.394
Please just leave me alone.

1:23:23.330 --> 1:23:24.832
Wait.

how much I appreciate
all your help.

1:26:50.237 --> 1:26:51.939
Thank you so much.

1:26:53.072 --> 1:26:56.076
So is this like a
goodbye gift or...

1:26:58.144 --> 1:27:00.480
No, actually I was hoping

1:27:02.081 --> 1:27:06.052
you'd escort me to Rex's
party tomorrow night.

1:27:06.086 --> 1:27:06.954
Really?

1:27:24.638 --> 1:27:25.805
That's a yes.

It's not the same
without London.

1:28:05.612 --> 1:28:06.913
I didn't wanna say it.

1:28:06.947 --> 1:28:07.480
I can't believe we
thought we could do

1:28:07.514 --> 1:28:08.983
this show without her.

1:28:09.015 --> 1:28:10.584
At least we can give
Dylan credit for trying.

1:28:12.885 --> 1:28:15.121
You guys going to the
football game tomorrow night?

1:28:15.154 --> 1:28:18.125
Gee, I wonder
why you're going.

1:28:18.157 --> 1:28:20.026
'Cause he's so hot.

1:28:21.161 --> 1:28:24.297
Okay, whatever.

1:28:24.331 --> 1:28:26.200
I didn't tell
Chad about Madison.

1:28:26.233 --> 1:28:27.134
- Wait, what?
- What?

1:28:27.166 --> 1:28:28.736
I tried but he just...

1:28:28.769 --> 1:28:31.639
Somebody's gotta tell
Chad what's going down.

1:28:31.671 --> 1:28:33.006
I know, I don't
wanna see him get hurt.

1:28:33.040 --> 1:28:33.940
Yeah?

1:28:33.974 --> 1:28:35.142
Well, you know what?

1:28:35.175 --> 1:28:36.010
You're about to get hurt.

1:28:36.042 --> 1:28:37.077
What?

1:28:37.111 --> 1:28:42.049
Get it off of me!

1:28:43.183 --> 1:28:45.219
The Cougars, delight

1:28:45.251 --> 1:28:47.754
Bring tonight.

1:28:47.787 --> 1:28:48.621
We fight.

1:28:48.654 --> 1:28:49.956
We win.

1:28:49.989 --> 1:28:52.026
And do it all over again.

1:28:52.059 --> 1:28:53.728
Go get 'em, Cougars!

1:28:55.062 --> 1:28:56.764
Let's go, Cougars.

1:29:22.022 --> 1:29:24.358
Number
one, number one.

1:29:24.390 --> 1:29:25.326
Number one, number.

1:29:25.358 --> 1:29:26.660
We're from Texas.

1:29:38.705 --> 1:29:40.774
Hey, you know what, hey.

1:29:44.711 --> 1:29:47.081
Yo, that last
play is going viral.

1:29:47.113 --> 1:29:48.681
You guys are legends!

1:29:48.715 --> 1:29:50.684
Okay, okay.

1:29:50.716 --> 1:29:53.386
Let's not get carried away here.

1:29:53.420 --> 1:29:58.091
So you got any more
homework you want me to do?

1:29:58.125 --> 1:29:59.026
What?

1:29:59.059 --> 1:30:01.228
You got any more homework?

1:30:01.260 --> 1:30:02.095
Oh.

1:30:02.129 --> 1:30:03.197
Uh, no.

1:30:03.229 --> 1:30:07.367
But could you be a sweetheart
and get me a drink?

1:30:07.401 --> 1:30:08.269
Please.

1:30:09.403 --> 1:30:10.271
Sure.

1:30:14.440 --> 1:30:16.242
Hey.

1:30:16.276 --> 1:30:17.144
Hey.

1:30:24.751 --> 1:30:26.754
Hey, you made it.

1:30:26.787 --> 1:30:28.055
Thanks for inviting me.

1:30:28.087 --> 1:30:28.855
No problem.

1:30:28.889 --> 1:30:30.123
Where's your boyfriend?

1:30:30.157 --> 1:30:32.993
What boyfriend?

1:30:33.794 --> 1:30:35.261
You know what?

1:30:35.295 --> 1:30:36.263
I can't believe I've
never noticed this before

1:30:36.295 --> 1:30:38.331
but you're actually really cute.

1:30:38.364 --> 1:30:39.265
Oh really?

1:30:39.299 --> 1:30:40.234
Mmm hmm.

1:30:40.267 --> 1:30:41.268
Usually you don't
give me the time of day.

1:30:54.046 --> 1:30:54.814
Thirsty?

1:30:57.050 --> 1:30:57.818
Thanks.

1:31:01.487 --> 1:31:02.822
Sorry about the other day.

1:31:02.855 --> 1:31:04.291
No look, I'm sorry.

1:31:04.323 --> 1:31:05.291
If you wanna be with Madison,

1:31:05.325 --> 1:31:06.193
- it's okay.
- No.

1:31:10.197 --> 1:31:13.334
I don't think she
wants to be with me.

1:31:14.334 --> 1:31:16.470
You can do better.

1:31:17.804 --> 1:31:18.672
Yeah.

1:31:19.674 --> 1:31:21.475
Okay, I just need to
see when she walks in.

1:31:21.507 --> 1:31:23.678
Yes, no problem.

1:31:25.479 --> 1:31:27.314
I'll be right back.

1:31:27.346 --> 1:31:28.215
Sydney.

1:31:29.181 --> 1:31:30.483
I'm just gonna go
get something to eat.

1:31:30.517 --> 1:31:32.118
Wait, no, don't.

1:31:35.221 --> 1:31:36.890
I'm, I'm so sorry.

1:31:40.493 --> 1:31:42.129
I'm sorry, too, London.

1:31:42.162 --> 1:31:45.132
And if you wanna go for
Jake, by all means go ahead.

1:31:45.165 --> 1:31:48.202
I found someone who
really likes me.

1:31:48.234 --> 1:31:49.502
Wait, at this school?

1:31:49.536 --> 1:31:52.339
Ha ha.

1:31:52.371 --> 1:31:53.806
Leo.

1:31:53.840 --> 1:31:54.507
Oh.

1:31:54.541 --> 1:31:55.476
Mmm hmm.

1:31:55.509 --> 1:31:57.211
I hear he's good with numbers.

1:31:57.243 --> 1:31:58.812
That, too.

1:31:58.845 --> 1:31:59.513
Okay.

1:32:01.247 --> 1:32:02.148
Come here.

1:32:02.181 --> 1:32:03.384
But it's good.

1:32:05.852 --> 1:32:07.854
Hey, isn't that London?

1:32:09.989 --> 1:32:11.892
I can't believe this.

1:32:11.925 --> 1:32:12.826
What?

1:32:12.858 --> 1:32:14.160
After all I did for her

1:32:14.193 --> 1:32:16.496
she's friends with
those freaks again?

1:32:16.529 --> 1:32:17.363
Who cares?

1:32:17.397 --> 1:32:18.364
You're with me now.

1:32:18.398 --> 1:32:19.233
Forget about her.

1:32:19.265 --> 1:32:20.433
Shut up, Rex.

1:32:20.466 --> 1:32:23.203
That bitch gave me a black eye.

1:32:30.277 --> 1:32:31.245
Hey, what's going on here?

1:32:31.278 --> 1:32:32.546
Get your hands off of him.

1:32:32.578 --> 1:32:33.913
Um, you can go now.

1:32:33.947 --> 1:32:35.382
Thanks for keeping
him company, Stella,

1:32:35.415 --> 1:32:37.184
but I got it.

1:32:37.216 --> 1:32:38.251
I've been looking
everywhere for you.

1:32:38.285 --> 1:32:39.118
Where have you been?

1:32:39.152 --> 1:32:41.188
Yeah, she's lying.

1:32:41.220 --> 1:32:42.522
What'd you say?

1:32:42.555 --> 1:32:45.526
Everything that comes
out of her mouth is a lie.

1:32:45.559 --> 1:32:46.894
Boom.

1:32:47.827 --> 1:32:49.263
Mmm hmm.

1:32:49.295 --> 1:32:52.265
Yeah, I saw her getting
real cozy with Rex earlier.

1:32:52.299 --> 1:32:54.268
You're delusional.

1:32:54.300 --> 1:32:55.868
Me and Rex, are you kidding me?

1:32:55.902 --> 1:32:56.870
Uh uh.

1:32:56.903 --> 1:32:57.905
That's not true.

1:32:57.938 --> 1:32:59.573
Madison, I saw it, too.

1:32:59.605 --> 1:33:02.876
Oh come on, Chad, I saw
her hands all over you.

1:33:02.908 --> 1:33:03.576
Stella?

1:33:03.609 --> 1:33:05.011
Mmm.

1:33:05.045 --> 1:33:06.580
We were just standing
over by the punch bowl.

1:33:06.612 --> 1:33:08.815
Chad, why are you
even with her, okay?

1:33:08.849 --> 1:33:11.285
I mean, Stella likes you.

1:33:11.318 --> 1:33:12.152
I didn't...

1:33:12.184 --> 1:33:13.286
Don't be dumb, Chad.

1:33:13.319 --> 1:33:14.487
Are you really doing this?

1:33:14.520 --> 1:33:16.422
And you, who do
you think you are?

1:33:16.456 --> 1:33:17.224
You're just a little hippie.

1:33:17.256 --> 1:33:19.225
- You don't compare to me.
- Madison.

1:33:19.259 --> 1:33:19.993
What?

1:33:21.327 --> 1:33:22.895
You like her?

1:33:22.929 --> 1:33:25.933
Okay, so why don't you
just kiss her then?

1:33:25.965 --> 1:33:27.233
Do it.

1:33:27.267 --> 1:33:29.569
Do it.

1:33:29.603 --> 1:33:30.437
Do it.

1:33:30.470 --> 1:33:31.605
Do it.

1:33:31.638 --> 1:33:32.906
You're
not gonna do it anyway

1:33:32.938 --> 1:33:35.341
'cause you've always
been a coward.

1:33:37.544 --> 1:33:39.179
You're such a...

1:33:43.483 --> 1:33:44.918
Chad!

1:33:44.951 --> 1:33:46.185
Lots more!

1:33:46.219 --> 1:33:46.953
Get off of him!

1:33:46.987 --> 1:33:47.855
Get off of her.

1:33:53.359 --> 1:33:55.528
She can't swim.

1:33:56.897 --> 1:33:58.998
Oh my God, she's drowning.

1:34:11.978 --> 1:34:12.613
It's okay.

1:34:12.645 --> 1:34:14.947
It's okay, it's okay.

1:34:14.980 --> 1:34:15.849
Okay?

1:34:17.651 --> 1:34:20.487
Thank you.

1:34:20.519 --> 1:34:21.354
Whatever.
