09:55.856 --> 09:57.466
I guess not.

09:59.163 --> 10:01.122
But you've been with women?

10:01.165 --> 10:02.471
A woman.

10:03.646 --> 10:05.648
-A long time ago.

10:05.692 --> 10:08.999
Any chance of you two
getting back together?

10:10.174 --> 10:11.785
No.

10:12.916 --> 10:14.962
But you keep seeing her
and hearing her

10:15.005 --> 10:16.311
in your head, huh?

10:16.354 --> 10:17.965
Mm-hmm.

10:18.008 --> 10:20.097
Women will do that.

10:20.141 --> 10:21.751

10:22.883 --> 10:24.406
Okay.

10:43.468 --> 10:44.774
Fuck it.

10:55.089 --> 10:56.438
Hi.

10:59.571 --> 11:00.660
Hello?

11:00.703 --> 11:01.922
Shit!

11:30.733 --> 11:32.692
Pen, are you asleep?

11:34.650 --> 11:35.738
Yeah.

11:35.782 --> 11:37.479
That's... Okay.

11:54.801 --> 11:56.541
Are you still sleeping?

11:56.585 --> 11:58.065
Yes!

12:01.633 --> 12:03.026
Hey.

12:05.637 --> 12:07.422
What's wrong?

12:07.465 --> 12:10.425
I'm drunk, and I'm gay.

12:12.514 --> 12:14.995
Can I sleep in here?

12:15.038 --> 12:17.084
I won't try to make out
with you or anything

12:17.127 --> 12:20.435
-unless that's what
you want me to do.
-Sara!

12:20.478 --> 12:23.743
Okay, good.
I'm too tired anyway.

12:32.490 --> 12:35.189
You're such a good friend to me.

12:35.232 --> 12:36.668
I'm glad I can be.

12:38.322 --> 12:40.672
I slept with
a total stranger tonight.

12:41.891 --> 12:43.806
Really?

12:43.850 --> 12:47.244
You must think I'm so crazy.

12:47.288 --> 12:48.724
Do you think you're crazy?

12:48.768 --> 12:50.726
No, I mean...

12:50.770 --> 12:52.859
I think I'm amazing.

12:53.903 --> 12:56.079
-Yeah.

12:57.385 --> 12:58.734
Hmm.

13:00.040 --> 13:02.912
So you slept
with a woman
you don't know?

13:02.956 --> 13:05.523
No, I kissed a woman.

13:05.567 --> 13:07.134
I slept with a man.

13:07.177 --> 13:09.136
Not that
I didn't try
for a woman.

13:09.179 --> 13:11.051
I tried for two women actually,

13:11.094 --> 13:14.271
and they both fell apart
really quickly, twice,

13:14.315 --> 13:17.057
and so, I went with what I know.

13:17.100 --> 13:20.277
Men are so... easy.

13:21.713 --> 13:23.803
Yeah, they are.

13:23.846 --> 13:27.676
I got so
sad-angry with myself
at that lesbian bar,

13:27.719 --> 13:29.765
and then I made
this ill-advised
phone call

13:29.809 --> 13:32.855
with the little bit
of liquid courage
that I had left.

13:32.899 --> 13:36.380
And when that went
so shitty-shitti-shittily-

13:36.424 --> 13:37.860
Shitty? Shit!

13:37.904 --> 13:39.514
When that did not go well,

13:39.557 --> 13:41.516
I went to the bar next-door,

13:41.559 --> 13:43.474
and I just walked up
to the first guy I saw,

13:43.518 --> 13:46.216
and I asked him
if he wanted to fuck.

13:46.260 --> 13:49.741
And... surprise, he did,
and so we went to his--

13:49.785 --> 13:51.874
-Sara!
-Well...

13:51.918 --> 13:53.484
We went to his apartment,

13:53.528 --> 13:57.097
and it was actually really good.

13:57.140 --> 14:00.056
Like, he was really good,
and it was really good,

14:00.100 --> 14:05.192
and I came a lot, and...

14:05.235 --> 14:07.759
I don't even know
how to get his...
I didn't get his number.

14:07.803 --> 14:09.674
I don't even remember
what his name was.

14:09.718 --> 14:12.808
It was some stupid,
generic guy name.

14:12.852 --> 14:16.899
And then we kissed goodbye,
and he said good night.

14:16.943 --> 14:18.814
And we both knew what it meant

14:18.858 --> 14:21.382
that, like,
I was in control and...

14:22.644 --> 14:24.080
I was just satisfied
and done with him.

14:24.124 --> 14:25.952
So then, I got a cab home,

14:25.995 --> 14:29.172
and now, I've been
sitting on your couch,

14:29.216 --> 14:32.610
drinking too much wine,
and thinking about August.

14:32.654 --> 14:33.873
Mm.

14:35.135 --> 14:37.093
Men are so weird.

14:38.181 --> 14:39.791
And amazing.

14:40.967 --> 14:43.621
I mean, I know I want
to be with women,

14:43.665 --> 14:51.499
but how am I supposed to give up
a bigger, stronger man?

14:51.542 --> 14:55.895
Like, lifting me up,
and moving me around, and...

14:58.114 --> 15:03.728
making decisions for me,
and focusing on me,

15:03.772 --> 15:07.297
focusing on
not cumming too soon.

15:07.341 --> 15:11.606
I love when guys can't
figure things out.

15:11.649 --> 15:16.959
Like when they're staring
at a pool table or something.

15:17.003 --> 15:19.092
I mean, focus. God!

15:20.093 --> 15:23.400
Focus is just so fucking sexy.

15:23.444 --> 15:24.532
Mm.

15:24.575 --> 15:26.751
And I hate when they yell,

15:26.795 --> 15:33.062
but I love when
they get angry about stuff
and get super-passionate.

15:33.106 --> 15:38.154
And I love when...
when guys have, like,
big, strong hands,

15:38.198 --> 15:42.115
and they have, like,
those big veins on them and...

15:42.158 --> 15:43.638
the hands that do work,

15:43.681 --> 15:45.596
and they have
those little scars.

15:45.640 --> 15:49.731
I mean, hands
that should scare me,
but they don't scare me.

15:49.774 --> 15:51.472
Men comfort me.

15:53.039 --> 15:55.998
Women, on the other hand,
terrify me,

15:56.042 --> 15:58.566
like, trip me up.

16:00.176 --> 16:03.527
It feels like it should be
the other way around.

16:03.571 --> 16:04.572
Mm.

16:05.573 --> 16:08.663
I mean, women are soft and...

16:09.881 --> 16:12.319
We have the same parts.
I just...

16:14.277 --> 16:17.759
I just know they are
what I want right now.

16:23.373 --> 16:26.463
Did you really date
Jane McFarlane in college?

16:29.075 --> 16:30.859
Yeah, how did you know that?

16:32.382 --> 16:34.645
Sara, everybody knew.

16:38.780 --> 16:41.304
I hate her so much.

16:42.523 --> 16:44.481
No, you don't.

16:47.441 --> 16:50.487
You're right, Penelope.
I don't hate her.

16:50.531 --> 16:54.883
-I hate you...
for contradicting me.

16:54.926 --> 16:57.668
I am so contradictory.

17:00.845 --> 17:02.195
Penelope!

17:03.239 --> 17:05.067
Did you just make a dick joke?

17:05.111 --> 17:07.069
-Shh. You're so loud.

17:07.113 --> 17:09.637
I have never heard
you make a dick joke.

17:09.680 --> 17:11.595
-Okay, go to sleep.
-Ever!

17:11.638 --> 17:14.858
That's the saddest dick joke
I've ever heard.

17:14.903 --> 17:17.471
Shh. Bye. Bye.
Good night.

17:20.126 --> 17:23.303
♪

17:37.143 --> 17:39.188
Oh, my God!

17:39.232 --> 17:40.450
Jesus!

17:42.322 --> 17:45.412
It's like looking at an autopsy,
some of these women.

17:45.455 --> 17:47.109
Really?

17:47.153 --> 17:51.244
No! No, not you.
This woman's profile pictures.

17:51.287 --> 17:52.593
No, not--

17:52.636 --> 17:54.769
That coat looked
so great on you.

17:54.812 --> 17:57.511
I think you would be
so glad you had that.

18:01.167 --> 18:03.038
Have a good day!

18:13.353 --> 18:14.702
Uh... hi.

18:14.745 --> 18:16.486
What are you doing here?

18:18.836 --> 18:22.362
Um... I forgot a couple things.

18:22.405 --> 18:23.580
You left your checkbook.

18:23.624 --> 18:25.495
I know.

18:25.539 --> 18:27.106
And my robe.

18:31.371 --> 18:33.199
Have you seen my pen?

18:33.242 --> 18:35.723
That feather pen?

18:35.766 --> 18:38.117
Anything else that
you would like to take from me?

18:40.510 --> 18:42.382
Not that I can
think of right now.

18:42.425 --> 18:45.254
When you coming back home?
I don't like this at all.

18:45.298 --> 18:46.908
August, it's been,
like, two days.

18:46.951 --> 18:49.040
But have you put on weight?

18:49.084 --> 18:50.781
'Cause you look
like maybe you have.

18:50.825 --> 18:53.784
Okay, I really just
came to get my pen.

18:53.828 --> 18:55.264
And your stupid robe.

18:55.308 --> 18:57.571
August, you're really bad
at trying to be an asshole.

18:57.614 --> 18:58.920
I know.

18:58.963 --> 19:01.183
Just don't try and be
something you're not.

19:01.227 --> 19:02.967
What does that mean, Sara?

19:03.011 --> 19:06.275
Can you just tell me
if you find that pen, please?

19:06.319 --> 19:08.103
It's really important to me.

19:08.147 --> 19:10.845
Yes, a pen is very important
at this point in time.

19:10.888 --> 19:13.326
It is really important to me.

19:13.369 --> 19:15.937
Great!
Have an awesome day, Sara!

19:20.507 --> 19:21.725
Hmm.

19:23.118 --> 19:24.293
Okay.

19:29.168 --> 19:30.734
Okay.

19:37.611 --> 19:39.221
Um...

19:39.265 --> 19:41.789
Okay. Like this...

19:43.834 --> 19:44.879
What are you doing?

19:44.922 --> 19:46.881
Nothing.

19:46.924 --> 19:48.230
Clearly.

19:48.274 --> 19:49.753
Let me know if you need help.

19:49.797 --> 19:51.102
I will.

19:54.193 --> 19:57.108
I do need help.

20:00.895 --> 20:02.592
Hey, there.
Hey.

20:02.636 --> 20:05.508
-Yes. Yes.

20:05.552 --> 20:07.075
Not that other name
that you made up for me,

20:07.118 --> 20:09.425
which I'm dying to know.

20:09.469 --> 20:11.340
Oh...

20:12.428 --> 20:13.603
It's--

20:13.647 --> 20:15.257
Do you wanna
try on some scarves?

20:16.345 --> 20:20.131
Um, no. No, not really. Uh...

20:20.175 --> 20:22.699
My friend is playing
in this band tonight,
and, uh...

20:22.743 --> 20:25.441
and, uh,
there's a bunch of us going,

20:25.485 --> 20:26.790
a couple girls
from the coffee shop,

20:26.834 --> 20:28.314
and I know it's last-minute,

20:28.357 --> 20:31.752
but I wanted to see
if you were available,
like 8:00.

20:31.795 --> 20:34.102
Um...

20:34.145 --> 20:35.799
Can someone
help me unzip this?

20:35.843 --> 20:38.280
Yeah, of course.
One second.

20:40.978 --> 20:42.502
Yes. Um...

20:42.545 --> 20:44.417
I have to leave
at 10:00, though.

20:44.460 --> 20:46.201
That's cool.

20:46.245 --> 20:48.986
Just, um, just meet me
outside the coffee shop
when you get off.

20:49.030 --> 20:51.772
-Okay.
-Okay. Cool.

21:05.351 --> 21:08.441
-Hi.
-Hey.

21:08.484 --> 21:10.312

Okay.

23:00.683 --> 23:02.511
Uh, right here, I guess.

23:10.040 --> 23:13.174
Okay, well,
I will see you later.

23:13.217 --> 23:14.871
Thank you for everything.

23:14.915 --> 23:16.873
I don't... I don't know
what I would have done
without you.

23:16.917 --> 23:19.093
You're welcome.

23:19.136 --> 23:20.790
I need the exercise anyway.

23:20.834 --> 23:23.358
I meant thanks for everything.

23:24.359 --> 23:27.667
If you didn't help me with...

23:27.710 --> 23:29.930
with everything, I don't know
what I would have done.

23:29.973 --> 23:31.801
Well, you're about
to find out.

23:37.633 --> 23:39.461
So, this is everything.

23:39.505 --> 23:41.463
I'm gonna go return the rental.

23:41.507 --> 23:45.554
You don't have to go
right this second, do you?

23:46.773 --> 23:48.252
No, I guess not.

23:48.296 --> 23:50.516
'Cause you could hang out
for a little if you wanted,

23:50.559 --> 23:52.039
and we could play pretend,

23:52.082 --> 23:54.084
and have one of our days
where we stay in,

23:54.128 --> 23:57.305
and we could order
that disgusting Mr. Fun's
you like so much.

23:57.348 --> 23:59.742
I think I wanna go.

23:59.786 --> 24:01.265
Okay.

24:02.266 --> 24:04.268
Okay.

24:04.312 --> 24:07.010
I feel bad about the way
you saw me the other day.

24:07.054 --> 24:10.753
I wasn't... doing too well.

24:10.797 --> 24:12.146
I understand.

24:13.800 --> 24:15.584
Are you ready
to tell me why you left?

24:18.152 --> 24:20.067
I can. I don't...

24:20.110 --> 24:21.460
I don't know
if you wanna hear it.

24:23.723 --> 24:25.725
Why are you doing this?

24:29.250 --> 24:31.426
Because of women.

24:34.429 --> 24:35.517
Women?

24:35.561 --> 24:38.955
I wanna date women, and...

24:40.000 --> 24:41.828
walk around, and hold hands,

24:41.871 --> 24:46.310
and dress up,
and go out, and...

24:46.354 --> 24:50.271
make dinner, and go to bed,
and have sex with them.

24:51.707 --> 24:53.187
We're not getting
married anymore

24:53.230 --> 24:54.580
because you wanna
have sex with women?

25:03.197 --> 25:06.113
I keep waiting
for you to crack a smile,
tell me you're fucking with me,

25:06.156 --> 25:07.680
but it looks like
you're about to cry, so--

25:07.723 --> 25:09.420
I'm just so sorry.

25:12.336 --> 25:16.253
How long...
have you wanted to have...

25:17.603 --> 25:18.604
be with a woman?

25:18.647 --> 25:21.302
I mean, for a long time.

25:22.521 --> 25:24.348
Um...

25:24.392 --> 25:30.441
Before college, but college
is the first time that I did.

25:31.791 --> 25:34.141
And I miss it,

25:34.184 --> 25:37.057
and I feel... dead inside.

25:37.100 --> 25:39.973
I don't know.
I knew it when I met you,

25:40.016 --> 25:42.279
but you're so beautiful,
and kind,

25:42.323 --> 25:43.890
and I love you so much.

25:43.933 --> 25:47.415
I mean, any girl would be crazy
not to wanna marry you.

25:47.458 --> 25:48.895
Well, not any girl.

25:55.641 --> 25:57.556
Do you not want to be with men?

25:57.599 --> 26:00.428
I mean, I do.

26:00.471 --> 26:02.256
I love men.

26:02.299 --> 26:04.432
So, you're bisexual.

26:06.086 --> 26:08.349
I don't know what I am.

26:09.785 --> 26:11.613
Wait. Who did you
sleep with in college?

26:11.657 --> 26:13.093
Lots of people.

26:13.136 --> 26:16.487
No, what...
What woman?

26:16.531 --> 26:18.054
My roommate,

26:19.099 --> 26:21.405
Jane McFarlane.

26:22.450 --> 26:23.973
Oh.

26:24.017 --> 26:25.409
What?

26:25.453 --> 26:27.847
I've only seen pictures, but...

26:28.935 --> 26:30.371
she's hot.

26:30.414 --> 26:32.460
I mean, she's married
and has two kids,

26:33.592 --> 26:36.203
and yeah, she's...
she's beautiful.

26:36.246 --> 26:38.031
So, you've
already talked to her?

26:38.074 --> 26:40.381
No. I called her,
and she answered,

26:40.424 --> 26:42.644
and I cursed at her,
and I hung up.

26:44.864 --> 26:47.257
Oh.  Shit!

26:55.048 --> 26:57.224
I had... I had no idea.

26:59.400 --> 27:01.750
I had no idea
that's why you left.

27:04.013 --> 27:05.624
I'm sorry for laughing.

27:05.667 --> 27:08.975
It's fine.
I know it's...

27:09.018 --> 27:10.933
It's kind of funny.

27:16.025 --> 27:20.813
I think, for her, I was
just some college fling.

27:20.856 --> 27:24.468
And for me, I loved her.

27:26.035 --> 27:28.168
I'd always known
I was attracted to women,

27:28.211 --> 27:32.302
but I didn't know
I could love a woman
that deeply,

27:32.346 --> 27:34.304
and, like, make love to a woman.

27:34.348 --> 27:36.263
And for her, I was just company,

27:36.306 --> 27:39.005
like just some, ugh, girlfriend.

27:42.269 --> 27:44.837
It doesn't feel as bad
to talk about it
right this second,

27:44.880 --> 27:48.057
but for
the past week and a half,
I've been a total wreck.

27:49.755 --> 27:51.713
So, what now?

27:51.757 --> 27:53.759
I don't know. I mean...

27:55.282 --> 27:57.806
I guess I do what women do.

27:57.850 --> 27:59.939
Women seeking women.

28:02.245 --> 28:05.684
Are you going to date men too?

28:09.165 --> 28:10.253
Maybe.

28:15.302 --> 28:17.043
Can I date?

28:18.218 --> 28:21.787
Can I go out with women too?

28:21.830 --> 28:25.834
I mean, you don't have
to ask my permission.

28:32.319 --> 28:33.886
I miss you.

28:37.803 --> 28:39.282
I know you do.

28:41.284 --> 28:42.503
Come here.

29:03.654 --> 29:06.048
I gotta go return the truck.

29:16.842 --> 29:18.060
-Okay.
-Okay.

29:18.104 --> 29:19.496
-Bye.
-Bye.

29:41.954 --> 29:43.694
Hello?

29:43.738 --> 29:44.913
Hi.

29:46.436 --> 29:47.829
Hi. Who's this?

29:47.873 --> 29:50.614
It's Colleen from the site.

29:50.658 --> 29:52.616
Hi, Colleen. Um...

29:54.183 --> 29:55.532
It's nice to meet you.

29:55.576 --> 29:58.231
Or, uh...

29:59.406 --> 30:02.017
You as well.

30:02.061 --> 30:04.759
Thanks for sending your number.
I know it's scary.

30:05.804 --> 30:07.066
It is.

30:07.109 --> 30:12.245
Um, have you...
Have you done this before?

30:12.288 --> 30:15.378
Well, this is the first time
we've put an ad out,

30:15.422 --> 30:17.380
and you're
the first person we liked.

30:18.425 --> 30:20.296
Well, that makes
me feel special.

30:20.340 --> 30:22.733
It should.

30:22.777 --> 30:25.171
Uh, it's you
and your husband, right?

30:25.214 --> 30:26.563
Yes.

30:28.043 --> 30:29.349
Is that okay?

30:29.392 --> 30:32.395
Yeah, that's...
That's great.

30:32.439 --> 30:34.789
That's... very exciting.

30:35.834 --> 30:37.313
You got a great voice.

30:38.358 --> 30:41.100
Thanks. So do you.

30:42.362 --> 30:44.103
We'll talk soon.

30:44.146 --> 30:45.452
Check your email tonight.

30:45.495 --> 30:46.714
Will do.

30:48.150 --> 30:49.325
Okay.

30:49.369 --> 30:51.719
Um... bye.

30:51.762 --> 30:53.590
Have a good night.

31:25.144 --> 31:27.015
Are you guys
not nervous at all?

31:27.059 --> 31:28.625
Oh, no, of course
we're nervous.

31:28.669 --> 31:31.411
I mean, I kind of was
under the impression

31:31.454 --> 31:33.804
you'd had tons
of experience with this.

31:33.848 --> 31:35.458
I wouldn't say tons.

31:35.502 --> 31:38.374
I would say
that we have had
more near misses

31:38.418 --> 31:40.072
than actual real,
all-the-way hits.

31:40.115 --> 31:41.725
Why do you think that is?

31:41.769 --> 31:43.858
We scare people away.

31:43.902 --> 31:45.947
Well... why?

31:45.991 --> 31:50.038
Because we're sincere
about who we are
and what we want.

31:51.126 --> 31:52.954
I mean, that is scary.

31:52.998 --> 31:55.348
And...

31:55.391 --> 31:58.655
people can see that
it's gonna be more
than a one-night stand.

31:58.699 --> 32:02.398
And they know
that Ben is gonna be
in the relationship,

32:02.442 --> 32:05.097
and that's scary for them.

32:05.140 --> 32:06.750
I mean, even
if he's not involved,

32:06.794 --> 32:08.100
he's in the relationship.

32:08.143 --> 32:10.493
He's gonna
know the details
at the very least.

32:10.537 --> 32:12.104
That's scary, too.

32:12.147 --> 32:13.757
-Thank you.

32:14.976 --> 32:16.847
Um... Sorry. I can't...

32:16.891 --> 32:19.241
I can't believe
I'm sitting here.

32:19.285 --> 32:22.941
'Cause you just pictured
yourself in bed with us?

32:22.984 --> 32:24.943
Yeah. How do you know that?

32:24.986 --> 32:26.379
That's what we do.

32:26.422 --> 32:29.643
Women, we just... We ponder
all the potential regret.

32:29.686 --> 32:32.994
I don't...
I don't think
men do that.

32:33.038 --> 32:36.084
Ben has a whole thing about
how women and men are different.

32:36.128 --> 32:40.045
I mean, the differences
in their imaginations and...

32:40.088 --> 32:41.698
Just tell her your thing.

32:41.742 --> 32:45.137
I think-- And correct me
if I'm wrong about you.

32:45.180 --> 32:50.794
But I think women imagine
the before, during, and after,

32:50.838 --> 32:54.973
and that after,
uh, lying there,
staring at the ceiling

32:55.016 --> 32:58.237
next to someone you may
or may not know all that well,

32:58.280 --> 33:03.938
all of their flaws
just howling at you
from across the sheets,

33:03.982 --> 33:07.898
that after makes women stop
before it ever starts.

33:10.989 --> 33:12.512
I love the after.

33:14.427 --> 33:15.994
Um...

33:16.037 --> 33:17.647
Bye.
Bye.

33:17.691 --> 33:19.519
Um... But, um...

33:29.659 --> 33:31.226
I had to do that.

33:31.270 --> 33:33.272
Great. Okay.

33:33.315 --> 33:35.622
Um, okay.

33:35.665 --> 33:37.885
-Bye. Bye.
-Bye.

34:05.695 --> 34:07.436
No, no, the other one,
the other one.

34:07.480 --> 34:09.047
The other one is in the wash.

34:09.090 --> 34:11.005
This one will have to do
until that one is clean.

34:13.007 --> 34:14.400
You know you can't sleep

34:14.443 --> 34:15.922
in that recliner
overnight, Jerry.

34:15.966 --> 34:17.489
Remember what Dr. Linden said?

34:21.146 --> 34:24.496
It's the same conversation
night after night.

34:24.540 --> 34:29.197
He doesn't wanna listen,
and he's so upset in the morning
when his back won't work.

34:35.681 --> 34:37.813
Tell me, Sara, how's August?

34:39.164 --> 34:41.905
Um... we broke up.

34:41.949 --> 34:45.170
What

34:45.213 --> 34:47.302
With Penelope--
at-at Penelope's.

34:47.346 --> 34:48.347
Are you okay?

34:50.914 --> 34:52.612
Are you doing
any writing at all?

34:53.743 --> 34:56.224
Uh... yes.

34:56.268 --> 34:59.009
I'm... I mean,
here and there.

35:00.402 --> 35:03.231
I have a new subject
I'm working on.

35:04.798 --> 35:10.586
I think I'm going to date
this married couple for a while,

35:10.630 --> 35:13.241
uh, a man and a woman.

35:13.285 --> 35:15.243
Mostly, the woman.

35:15.287 --> 35:19.943
I think I'm gonna
date women for a while.

35:20.944 --> 35:22.294
Well, I'll say it again.

35:22.337 --> 35:24.209
I hope you're
making good choices

35:24.252 --> 35:27.951
and putting
that college education
we bought for you to good use.

35:29.170 --> 35:31.346
We've raised you right.

35:31.390 --> 35:32.826
You've got a good head
on your shoulders,

35:32.869 --> 35:35.524
and you can take
responsibility
for yourself.

35:42.314 --> 35:44.925
I think I'm bisexual, Mom.

35:48.363 --> 35:51.410
So, what would you
like for breakfast?

35:51.453 --> 35:53.412
I'll make you whatever you like.

35:55.414 --> 35:57.546
Whatever you wanna make.

35:58.895 --> 36:00.158
Okay.

36:04.249 --> 36:06.164
-Night, Mom.
-Good night.

36:20.656 --> 36:22.136
Good night, Jerry.

36:23.355 --> 36:24.921

Well, I don't know.
I might get tired of them,

It's not really that different

It's not!

Thank you.

38:08.764 --> 38:10.810
Done.
Good.

38:10.853 --> 38:12.246
Good?
Get another one.

38:12.290 --> 38:14.944
That's not good.

38:14.988 --> 38:16.642
So, I was kind of
telling him about us,

38:16.685 --> 38:19.340
and I felt like he was, like,
super into it and excited,

38:19.384 --> 38:21.342
but then also, like,
kind of freaked out.

38:21.386 --> 38:23.953
Like, the synapses
in his brain were kind of,
like, exploding.

38:23.997 --> 38:26.782
Sara, could you just shut up
for a second, baby?

38:26.826 --> 38:28.871
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, sorry.

38:28.915 --> 38:30.786
I just haven't seen you
in a few days, and I'm excited.

38:30.830 --> 38:32.440
I have herpes.

38:37.445 --> 38:42.058
I... I don't know
what to say. I...

38:42.102 --> 38:45.105
I'm not used
to being embarrassed.
I don't like it.

38:45.148 --> 38:48.282
One of you needs
to say something
smart and comforting.

38:48.326 --> 38:49.805
Well, I think--
-Not you.

38:51.329 --> 38:52.895
Are you contagious?

38:54.157 --> 38:56.246
I don't know. Probably.

38:56.290 --> 38:58.597

38:58.640 --> 39:00.338
You should, too.

39:00.381 --> 39:02.122
Well, that is a great idea.

39:02.165 --> 39:03.732
I just don't have insurance.

39:03.776 --> 39:04.820
Okay.

39:05.821 --> 39:08.215
Sara...

39:08.258 --> 39:11.566
could you just please
say something comforting?

39:11.610 --> 39:14.177
Well, I think maybe
you should be comforting me.

39:14.221 --> 39:17.703
All you have to do
is go to the doctor,
and get some $10 prescription

39:17.746 --> 39:19.226
and be up front
with all your partners.

39:19.269 --> 39:20.619
That's what I'm doing.

39:20.662 --> 39:22.403
But I have to go,
and spend hundreds of dollars,

39:22.447 --> 39:24.405
and get blood drawn,
which I fucking hate.

39:24.449 --> 39:27.103
And what's that mean for us?

39:28.844 --> 39:31.891
It means that...

39:31.934 --> 39:36.330

I gotta take this.

Hey.

Hey. You looking

40:58.194 --> 40:59.761
Yep.

-Mm-hmm.

41:02.285 --> 41:04.505
-Extremely.

41:07.377 --> 41:10.250
Didn't the two of you
go out on a date or something?

41:10.293 --> 41:12.208
No, not really.

41:12.252 --> 41:14.254
Aww. She not into chicks?

41:14.297 --> 41:16.474
Aww. I don't know.

41:17.475 --> 41:19.607
I don't know, actually, at all.

41:19.651 --> 41:21.957
I just think
she's so gorgeous.

41:22.001 --> 41:25.918
Well, isn't that reason enough
to go out on a second date,
or what?

41:25.961 --> 41:28.442
Is it? It seems so shallow.

41:28.486 --> 41:30.139
I mean, I don't know.
I'm new at this.

41:30.183 --> 41:33.229
So, is it okay
for me to just want
the physical right now

41:33.273 --> 41:34.927
and not care about love so much?

41:34.970 --> 41:36.581
I mean, obviously,
if it happens, that's great.

41:36.624 --> 41:40.498
But... is that terrible of me?

41:40.541 --> 41:42.978
Uh, I mean,
my first thought is yeah.

41:43.022 --> 41:45.546
You're just a step away
from being a dog in heat.

41:45.590 --> 41:48.854
Ew! Can I be a cat, please?

41:50.246 --> 41:54.163
It's only shallow
if you make it shallow.

41:54.207 --> 41:58.472
You know, if your biggest worry
is finding a playmate,

41:58.516 --> 42:00.518
that's a pretty
great place to be.

42:00.561 --> 42:02.998
Most people are concerned
about putting enough food
on the table

42:03.042 --> 42:04.826
and not getting shot.
Am I right?

42:04.870 --> 42:08.264
Well, yes, you are right.

42:08.308 --> 42:11.703
So, just be safe and be free.

42:17.056 --> 42:19.449
Well, where do these go?

42:22.061 --> 42:23.192
Hey!

42:23.236 --> 42:24.498
Hey, can you talk?

42:24.542 --> 42:26.500
Yeah. What's wrong?

42:26.544 --> 42:28.197
Oh, you know, I hate people.

42:28.241 --> 42:33.115
And people are
indifferent to me.

42:34.987 --> 42:36.684

42:36.728 --> 42:38.643
No.

42:38.686 --> 42:40.383
August!

42:40.427 --> 42:42.690
I'm not that drunk.

42:42.734 --> 42:46.302
I went out tonight
and last night

42:46.346 --> 42:48.740
and the night
before that.

42:48.783 --> 42:52.613
Women staring at me
like I have a horn growing
out of my forehead.

42:52.657 --> 42:55.921
I feel like I'm too old
to be doing this shit.

42:55.964 --> 42:58.793
It's awful. Ugh!
It's so fucking awful.

43:00.142 --> 43:02.014
Hey, hold on a second.

43:04.016 --> 43:05.583
-Hello.
Hi.

43:06.845 --> 43:07.846
Hi.

43:09.108 --> 43:10.588
Who's this?

43:10.631 --> 43:13.852
I'm sorry.
It's Ali from the Coffee Cat.

43:13.895 --> 43:15.941
Oh, hey!

43:15.984 --> 43:18.204
Hi. You busy?

43:18.247 --> 43:19.553
No, I'm not busy.

43:19.597 --> 43:22.948
Um, can you hold on?
Just hold on one second.

43:25.341 --> 43:26.908
Hey.

43:26.952 --> 43:28.388
Let me guess.

43:28.431 --> 43:30.825
It's Mr. and Mrs. Sodom,

43:30.869 --> 43:36.439
calling to invite you to another
120-some-odd-day orgy.

43:36.483 --> 43:39.399
No, I'm not seeing them anymore.
Not like that, anyway.

43:39.442 --> 43:41.009
Oh, good. Good, good, good.

43:41.053 --> 43:42.663
Have dinner with me on Saturday.

43:43.882 --> 43:45.710
Okay, I'll see you Saturday.

43:45.753 --> 43:47.276
Okay, bye for now.

43:47.320 --> 43:48.408
Okay, bye.

43:51.106 --> 43:53.065
-Hey, Ali.
Hi.

43:53.108 --> 43:54.675
Hey.

43:54.719 --> 43:58.113
Um... what's up?

43:59.332 --> 44:00.986
Nothing much. Um...

44:02.117 --> 44:04.163
Are you working tomorrow?

44:04.206 --> 44:05.904
Yes.

44:05.947 --> 44:08.036
Cool.

44:08.080 --> 44:12.084
I was hoping I could come by
and look for a dress to wear
to my brother's wedding.

44:12.127 --> 44:13.999
Oh, cool! Yeah!

44:15.827 --> 44:17.089
Um...

44:18.220 --> 44:21.093
What are you doing after that?

44:22.616 --> 44:23.878
After what?

44:24.923 --> 44:26.664
After you come by the shop.

44:28.230 --> 44:29.797
I'm going back to work.

44:31.494 --> 44:33.105
Right.

44:33.148 --> 44:35.716
Uh, what are
you doing after work?

44:35.760 --> 44:37.762
Nothing.

44:39.633 --> 44:43.376
Well, we should go out
and get a drink.

44:45.204 --> 44:46.814
Yeah, we should.

44:47.859 --> 44:50.209
Maybe just somewhere close.

44:51.776 --> 44:53.734
Sure. Yeah,
that's sounds great.

44:58.217 --> 45:00.306
Okay, so, um...

45:00.349 --> 45:03.744
Uh, your brother
is getting married.
Where is that happening?

45:03.788 --> 45:07.617
Upstate, Poughkeepsie.

45:07.661 --> 45:11.752
My mom wanted me
to wear a dress that
covers my tats, so...

45:13.449 --> 45:15.060
This could work.

45:16.278 --> 45:17.366
Aww!

45:18.367 --> 45:19.542
-Yeah!

45:19.586 --> 45:21.501
You look...

45:21.544 --> 45:23.155
It's dynamite.

45:24.504 --> 45:27.072
So, um, where are you from?

45:27.115 --> 45:28.638
Texas.

45:28.682 --> 45:31.685
Oh, we're both from the South.
That's cool.

45:31.729 --> 45:32.991
Really

45:33.034 --> 45:37.082
Well, originally,
I'm from northwest Florida.

45:37.125 --> 45:40.215
But, uh, my step-dad
and my mom live here now.

45:40.259 --> 45:42.217
That's sweet.
Did they move here
to be with you?

45:42.261 --> 45:44.567
No, my step-dad got really sick,

45:44.611 --> 45:49.268
so they moved out here
so he could get treatment
at Sloan Kettering.

45:49.311 --> 45:51.400
-I'm sorry.
-That's okay.
He's much better now.

45:51.444 --> 45:53.663
My mom says it's mostly
maintenance at this point.

45:59.408 --> 46:00.888
So, Texas.

46:00.932 --> 46:03.282
Florida.

46:03.325 --> 46:06.633
How was that? I mean,
I don't really know
too much about it,

46:06.676 --> 46:11.594
except... oranges,
boating, Disneyland.

46:11.638 --> 46:13.553
-World.

46:13.596 --> 46:15.947
Disney World.
Disneyland is in California.

46:17.209 --> 46:18.210
Right.

46:20.516 --> 46:22.301
Um, Florida is...

46:22.344 --> 46:25.086
I don't know.
Florida is funny.
Florida...

46:27.219 --> 46:30.788
They say you have
to go north to go south,
which is totally true.

46:30.831 --> 46:33.051
Northwest Florida is
basically the South.

46:34.052 --> 46:35.314
It's like Flor-bama.

46:35.357 --> 46:37.229
-It is.

46:38.621 --> 46:39.840
Um...

46:40.972 --> 46:43.148
Are your parents still together?

46:44.149 --> 46:45.585
Um, no.

46:45.628 --> 46:48.588
-Uh-huh, yeah.

46:48.631 --> 46:50.720
Do you have step

46:50.764 --> 46:52.722
Uh
Why do you ask?

46:52.766 --> 46:56.030
I don't know. I just feel
like we're a generation
of step-kids. It sucks.

46:57.379 --> 46:58.772
No, it's not fun.

46:58.816 --> 47:02.776
No. That is well-put.
It is not fun, at all.

47:02.820 --> 47:04.865
You're funny, Sara.

47:06.040 --> 47:07.868
So, what else?

47:07.912 --> 47:09.652
-I don't know.

47:09.696 --> 47:11.480
Um...

47:11.524 --> 47:14.092
How long have you been
with your girlfriend?

47:14.135 --> 47:16.964
-Girlfriend.

47:17.008 --> 47:18.879
You...

47:19.967 --> 47:23.449
No. You don't have a girlfriend.

47:25.581 --> 47:28.584
I thought you said you borrowed
that awesome... That one.

47:28.628 --> 47:30.456
Awesome scarf
from your girlfriend.

47:30.499 --> 47:33.502
My friend, Shelly,

47:33.546 --> 47:35.330
-she's a girl.
-Right.

47:37.028 --> 47:38.943
-Right.

47:40.205 --> 47:41.641
Of course.

47:41.684 --> 47:43.512
-You're funny, Sara.

47:43.556 --> 47:45.819
I don't know.

47:45.863 --> 47:47.952
You just...
You are.

47:49.344 --> 47:50.998
I don't think you mean to be.

47:52.391 --> 47:53.827
It's charming.

47:55.785 --> 47:57.570
Well, that's good, I think.

48:02.792 --> 48:04.011
Can I...

48:06.274 --> 48:07.580
Can I ask you something?

48:07.623 --> 48:10.235
Please,
ask me something immediately.

48:11.453 --> 48:13.325
Why'd you ask me out tonight?

48:14.413 --> 48:16.502
Oh, I don't know. Um...

48:16.545 --> 48:19.505
'Cause you asked me out
that other time,

48:19.548 --> 48:23.117
and so, I wanted
to ask you out
to make it even.

48:24.118 --> 48:25.511
Even steven.

48:26.599 --> 48:28.166
Okay.

48:28.209 --> 48:32.257
But I, um, asked you out
with a bunch of friends,

48:32.300 --> 48:35.608
and you asked me out alone.

48:35.651 --> 48:38.350
I don't have any friends.

48:40.047 --> 48:41.614
That's not true. I'm sorry.

48:41.657 --> 48:44.356
-I have plenty of friends.

48:45.357 --> 48:47.272
Um...

48:47.315 --> 48:49.056
You don't have to answer.

48:51.493 --> 48:53.626
I... I asked you out...

48:54.888 --> 48:57.543
because you interest me.

49:00.154 --> 49:01.373
Interest you how?

49:03.853 --> 49:07.335
I don't know. You're...

49:07.379 --> 49:08.946
I see you all the time,

49:08.989 --> 49:12.471
and you're friendly, and...

49:15.169 --> 49:17.476
I like the way you dress.

49:23.351 --> 49:26.224
Do you have to go?

49:26.267 --> 49:28.966
No, no. Do you?

49:29.009 --> 49:30.402
Mm-mm.

49:31.707 --> 49:32.970
Me neither.

49:34.319 --> 49:35.537
Good.

49:37.191 --> 49:38.584
Great.

49:44.503 --> 49:46.461
-Yes.

49:46.505 --> 49:48.028
What? You make me nervous.

49:48.072 --> 49:50.335
Well, I would never know that.

49:56.558 --> 49:58.169
You can say it.

50:00.084 --> 50:03.217
I can't promise that
I'm not gonna freak out,

50:03.261 --> 50:05.872
and... blush,

50:05.915 --> 50:07.961
or get up and go, but...

50:09.789 --> 50:12.139
you just spit it out.

50:22.236 --> 50:25.022
I find you
incredibly attractive.

50:27.241 --> 50:29.026
I...

50:29.069 --> 50:31.854
I look for you in the window
every time I go to work,

50:31.898 --> 50:35.858
and I come to your cafe
and drink that coffee,

50:35.902 --> 50:38.383
even though it's terrible.

50:38.426 --> 50:42.256
And I'm dating women
in my life right now,

50:42.300 --> 50:45.520
and I mean, I might
continue to forever.

50:45.564 --> 50:47.827
And if you're interested,

50:47.870 --> 50:53.224
and I... totally understand
if you're not gay or bi.

50:53.267 --> 50:55.791
I mean, even if you are
either of those things,

50:55.835 --> 50:58.925
I completely get it
if you're not attracted to me.

50:58.968 --> 51:00.666
Because I can be scary

51:00.709 --> 51:02.276
and talk too much
like I'm doing right now.

51:02.320 --> 51:04.713
But, um, you just...

51:05.932 --> 51:07.455
You seem really nice,

51:08.500 --> 51:10.067
and you're beautiful,

51:10.110 --> 51:12.330
and I wanna touch you,

51:12.373 --> 51:16.377
and I... don't even
know your last name.

51:21.252 --> 51:23.689
I guess what I'm--

51:23.732 --> 51:24.733
Wow. Okay.

51:24.777 --> 51:26.692
What I'm saying
is if you are--

51:26.735 --> 51:31.914
Are you interested
in seeing a woman,

51:31.958 --> 51:33.481
or women, or...

51:34.743 --> 51:37.311
me?

51:37.355 --> 51:39.966
'Cause I'm tired of buying
coffee I'm just gonna throw out.

51:43.056 --> 51:44.405
Proenza.

51:46.755 --> 51:48.017
What?

51:48.061 --> 51:49.497
My last name...

51:51.108 --> 51:52.413
is Proenza.

51:54.633 --> 51:56.200
That's a pretty name.

52:25.011 --> 52:27.883
This is the Manhattan-bound
F local train.

52:27.927 --> 52:30.973
The next stop is
Jay Street-Metro Tech.

52:34.412 --> 52:35.674
Hi.

52:35.717 --> 52:38.024
-Not much.

52:39.504 --> 52:41.767
-Let's go on a date.

52:41.810 --> 52:43.508
Yes, right now.

52:43.551 --> 52:45.814
Aren't we seeing each other
on Saturday?

52:45.858 --> 52:48.252
Well, I'm being spontaneous.

52:48.295 --> 52:50.515
Let's go out,
or let me come in.

52:50.558 --> 52:53.431
-I can't.

52:54.432 --> 52:55.868
Because I'm on a date.

52:57.130 --> 52:59.437
Yes.

52:59.480 --> 53:01.047
Like, right now?

53:02.396 --> 53:04.006
Well, how's it going?

53:05.007 --> 53:06.618
It's fine.

53:08.489 --> 53:10.970
Is she cute

53:11.013 --> 53:12.319
No.

53:12.363 --> 53:14.060
Come on.
Just, like, a little...

53:14.103 --> 53:16.236
No, she's not a doll, Sara.

53:17.585 --> 53:20.501
I'm not gonna steal her
from you.

53:20.545 --> 53:22.895
I have no game whatsoever.

53:22.938 --> 53:24.679
What happened?

53:24.723 --> 53:27.116
Oh, I asked a girl out
who's not into chicks.
That whole routine.

53:27.160 --> 53:29.075
Anyway, let me see her.

53:29.118 --> 53:32.034
No. Probably freaking her out
right now anyways.

53:32.078 --> 53:34.820
Come on. If she's hot,
I'll have a threesome
with you guys.

53:34.863 --> 53:36.778
-Oh, that's funny.
-You deserve one.

53:36.822 --> 53:38.084
Ha ha ha ha ha.

53:40.347 --> 53:42.306
Go home, Sara.

53:42.349 --> 53:43.742
Seriously.

53:46.223 --> 53:48.007
-Okay.

53:49.965 --> 53:51.489
Okay, have a good night.

54:47.632 --> 54:49.677
-Hey, Sara.
-Hello!

54:49.721 --> 54:51.244
-Not a lot.

54:51.288 --> 54:53.681
I was just in the neighborhood,
and I...

54:53.725 --> 54:55.248
Was not in the neighborhood.
That is a lie.

54:55.292 --> 54:57.424
I just came straight
from my mailbox to tell you--

54:57.468 --> 54:58.599
Where's Colleen?

54:58.643 --> 55:00.906
-She's asleep.
-Let's wake her up.

55:07.347 --> 55:08.696
Hi, Colleen!

55:10.394 --> 55:11.438
Hi, Sara.

55:11.482 --> 55:15.094
I have good, bad, good news.

55:15.137 --> 55:16.791
Yes.

55:19.794 --> 55:21.796
-Look at this.

55:26.540 --> 55:27.585
Oh.

55:31.806 --> 55:33.330
Congratulations, sweetie.

55:33.373 --> 55:35.854
What does it say?
-It says she's clear.

55:35.897 --> 55:39.292
But... I don't care.

55:39.336 --> 55:42.643
I don't care
what I don't have
and what you guys have.

55:42.687 --> 55:45.167
I wanna be with you guys anyway.

55:45.211 --> 55:47.996
And besides,
herpes isn't even,
like, a real disease.

55:48.040 --> 55:50.521
They tell you that it is just
to scare the shit out of you
in high school.

55:50.564 --> 55:52.044
Sara.

55:52.087 --> 55:54.002
But what they don't tell you
is that the older you get,

55:54.046 --> 55:55.482
the further apart
your breakouts are.

55:55.526 --> 55:57.223
I did research on it.

55:58.877 --> 56:01.575
Two-thirty.

56:01.619 --> 56:04.448
I thought you guys were
gonna do cartwheels about this.

56:04.491 --> 56:06.145
Sara, honey...

56:09.017 --> 56:10.802
You...

56:12.543 --> 56:14.327
You are with us,

56:14.371 --> 56:17.461
and you always will be.
I hope you know that.

56:17.504 --> 56:19.201
So, you're turning me down?

56:20.333 --> 56:22.814
For sex, yeah.

56:23.815 --> 56:25.469
As much as that
hurts right now,

56:25.512 --> 56:27.688
but... if you wanna
go get a shower,

56:27.732 --> 56:30.082
we can cuddle
until we go to work.

56:30.125 --> 56:32.563
-I don't wanna cuddle!
-That's a terrible thing to say.

56:32.606 --> 56:34.434
Well, I'm tired
of being fucking rejected.

56:34.478 --> 56:36.784
Oh, my God!
Sara, please stop whining.

56:39.221 --> 56:41.049
I cannot believe
I'm awake right now.

56:42.964 --> 56:46.054
You guys found someone else
already, didn't you?

56:46.098 --> 56:47.273
That's what this is all about.

56:47.316 --> 56:49.449
Not necessarily.

56:49.493 --> 56:53.148
So, I've already
been replaced.
That's amazing.

56:53.192 --> 56:54.759
I mean, I will say

56:54.802 --> 56:56.804
I've never been broken up
with two people
at the same time.

56:56.848 --> 56:58.850
So, I mean, hallelujah
for new experiences, right?

56:58.893 --> 57:00.199
Sara!

57:01.330 --> 57:04.421
Nobody could replace you,
seriously.

57:06.901 --> 57:08.250
Do I really whine?

57:08.294 --> 57:09.687
-Yes.
-Yes.

57:13.212 --> 57:15.301
Let's go to sleep.

58:25.371 --> 58:28.156
You weren't even
gonna say goodbye?

58:29.375 --> 58:31.682
What's the matter,
my little mentee?

58:31.725 --> 58:36.295
Of course I was
gonna say goodbye.

58:38.645 --> 58:40.778
But it's early.
You should go
back to sleep.

58:40.821 --> 58:42.301
I love you, baby.

58:44.303 --> 58:45.739
He talks in his sleep sometimes.

58:45.783 --> 58:47.132
I know.

58:49.003 --> 58:50.527
It's beautiful.

58:52.441 --> 58:54.618
And so are you.

58:54.661 --> 58:56.402
Thank you.

58:56.445 --> 58:57.708
For what?

59:00.232 --> 59:02.887
I know you're not talking
about my morning breath.

59:05.672 --> 59:07.761
Just thank you.

01:00:09.214 --> 01:00:10.781
Hey, it's August.

01:00:10.824 --> 01:00:12.870
-Leave a message,
and I'll call you back.
-August... Ugh!

like when we were together,

You need to get over yourself.

01:08:18.964 --> 01:08:21.270
And you need to hand me
that jewelry binder.

01:08:23.795 --> 01:08:25.448

Your reflexes so...

01:09:58.324 --> 01:09:59.891
What?

-Sharp and quick.

trying to make a joke.

-Not funny.

01:10:18.605 --> 01:10:21.217

01:10:25.003 --> 01:10:26.570
There she is.

01:10:28.833 --> 01:10:30.530
I thought maybe...

01:10:30.574 --> 01:10:33.185
maybe you'd just
gone away completely.

01:11:12.790 --> 01:11:16.141
Remember that place
we lived in the East Village?

01:11:16.184 --> 01:11:17.708
Yeah.

01:11:17.751 --> 01:11:20.188
And I'd make you
read my writing
on the fire escape...

01:11:20.232 --> 01:11:22.626
no matter how cold it was.

01:11:25.759 --> 01:11:28.240
"Subway Tales" would
have been a huge hit.

01:11:28.284 --> 01:11:30.460
Yeah, with somebody.

01:11:36.727 --> 01:11:38.511
It would have been such a hit.

01:11:40.296 --> 01:11:43.299
Did you write this
while you were playing
with yourself?

01:11:45.083 --> 01:11:48.173
Yeah. Well, I mean, trying to.

01:11:48.216 --> 01:11:49.957
-Hmm.

01:11:51.916 --> 01:11:53.221

01:11:53.265 --> 01:11:55.876
That you're reading, yeah.

01:11:57.400 --> 01:12:01.099
Honestly, it's...
as bad as it ever was.

01:12:02.622 --> 01:12:05.495
It's like...
I have no idea
what you're saying.

01:12:05.538 --> 01:12:08.367
It's like speaker static, Sara.

01:12:08.411 --> 01:12:11.544
But, hey, I'm not a novelist.
That's not what I do.

01:12:11.588 --> 01:12:14.982
So, hey, you're writing.
That means you're happy.

01:12:15.026 --> 01:12:16.375
So, that's good.

01:12:16.419 --> 01:12:18.769
You're such a cunt!

01:12:19.770 --> 01:12:21.249
God!

01:12:21.293 --> 01:12:24.688
Any by the way,
I know it's shitty.

01:12:24.731 --> 01:12:26.646
Then why'd
you show it to me?

01:12:26.690 --> 01:12:29.519
Because the stuff
that's made out of gold
isn't ready to be shown yet.

01:12:29.562 --> 01:12:31.608
-Hmm.
-Almost.

01:12:31.651 --> 01:12:35.612
It's all messy
in a notebook right now.

01:12:37.527 --> 01:12:39.703

The writing is good?

01:13:11.517 --> 01:13:14.520
Yeah, but we just
talked about that.

01:13:16.783 --> 01:13:18.916
What do you really wanna ask me?

01:13:21.484 --> 01:13:23.094
What are we doing?

01:13:25.618 --> 01:13:27.315
-I don't know!

01:13:32.016 --> 01:13:34.192
Fuck, I love you.

01:13:35.193 --> 01:13:37.021
I love you, too.

01:13:42.853 --> 01:13:44.420
I need another beer.

01:14:05.702 --> 01:14:07.834
-Wow.
Oh.

01:14:07.878 --> 01:14:09.401
That's some outfit.

01:14:09.445 --> 01:14:11.229
-Hi.
-Hey.

01:14:11.272 --> 01:14:13.405
Did you just get
back from the club?

01:14:13.449 --> 01:14:15.712
Something like that.

01:14:16.713 --> 01:14:17.975
It's classy.

01:14:18.018 --> 01:14:19.237
Well, yeah, that's me.

01:14:19.280 --> 01:14:22.370
Classy lady, walking
the streets at 7:00 a.m.

01:14:22.414 --> 01:14:25.504
So, I was thinking
of stopping by the shop tonight

01:14:25.548 --> 01:14:27.680
to see if you had any shoes
to match that dress.

01:14:27.724 --> 01:14:29.029
Maybe.

01:14:29.073 --> 01:14:30.640
Cool.
Then I'll stop by.

01:14:30.683 --> 01:14:33.991
-Have a good day.
-Yeah, you too.

01:14:34.034 --> 01:14:35.688
-Okay.
-Bye.

01:14:44.044 --> 01:14:47.961
So... I have a question
I wanna ask you.

01:14:48.005 --> 01:14:49.267
About what?

01:14:55.752 --> 01:14:57.580
What am I to you?

01:14:59.886 --> 01:15:01.758
Am I just filling some void?

01:15:01.801 --> 01:15:06.893
I just happen to be...
nearby and pretty?

01:15:08.025 --> 01:15:10.506
Probably.

01:15:10.549 --> 01:15:14.248
I mean, probably that
is what I see in you.

01:15:14.292 --> 01:15:16.033
But isn't that enough?

01:15:18.078 --> 01:15:19.950
For a night, yeah.

01:15:21.952 --> 01:15:23.997
Do you wanna kiss me?

01:15:26.826 --> 01:15:28.567
Yeah.

01:15:28.611 --> 01:15:29.699
Why?

01:15:33.006 --> 01:15:34.921
Because you wanna kiss me.

01:15:37.533 --> 01:15:39.491
Well, then, come closer.

01:15:46.106 --> 01:15:48.544
A little closer than that.

01:15:52.199 --> 01:15:55.942
I don't wanna start
and then stop halfway through.

01:15:55.986 --> 01:15:59.250
So if this is just
a quick fascination for you,

01:15:59.293 --> 01:16:02.601
you should go home.

01:16:02.645 --> 01:16:06.562
If you let me touch you,
I'm not gonna stop
until you push me away.

01:16:08.694 --> 01:16:10.609
Are you always so aggressive?

01:16:11.741 --> 01:16:13.438
It's just a place I'm in.

01:16:15.222 --> 01:16:16.920
Do you have a boyfriend?

01:16:16.963 --> 01:16:19.575
Uh... not really.

01:16:19.618 --> 01:16:22.186
What's that mean?

01:16:22.229 --> 01:16:25.537
It means that
I'm... seeing someone.

01:16:25.581 --> 01:16:28.758
I've gone on a few dates,
and it's nothing official.

01:16:28.801 --> 01:16:31.717
So, that guy
that I saw you with?

01:16:33.327 --> 01:16:36.592
Yes. Like I said,
it's nothing official.

01:16:41.031 --> 01:16:43.424
Have you ever kissed
a woman before?

01:16:45.513 --> 01:16:47.820
Once.

01:16:47.864 --> 01:16:49.648
In college.

01:16:49.692 --> 01:16:52.912
There were lots
of people around,
cheering and...

01:16:54.348 --> 01:16:56.655
That doesn't
count at all.

01:16:58.526 --> 01:17:00.093
I know.

01:17:02.530 --> 01:17:05.751
Do you have
any infectious diseases
I should know about?

01:17:07.274 --> 01:17:08.928
That's a crazy question.

01:17:08.972 --> 01:17:11.278
My answer is no.

01:17:11.322 --> 01:17:13.150
Good.

01:17:13.193 --> 01:17:14.891
-No.

01:17:16.196 --> 01:17:17.894
That's nice.

01:17:20.723 --> 01:17:22.507
Are you ready?

01:17:49.665 --> 01:17:51.188
Why are you laughing?

01:17:52.406 --> 01:17:54.321
You have soft lips.

01:17:55.975 --> 01:17:57.629
I'm not laughing.

01:18:27.267 --> 01:18:29.835
I can't believe
I'm doing this.

01:18:29.879 --> 01:18:32.403
-Your waist is so tiny.

01:18:34.753 --> 01:18:36.581
Are you done?

01:18:36.624 --> 01:18:39.062
Hm-mm. No.

01:18:41.847 --> 01:18:42.935
I...

01:18:44.284 --> 01:18:48.767
So...
I haven't stopped...

01:18:48.811 --> 01:18:52.118
thinking about this
since our first date.

01:18:53.554 --> 01:18:55.382
Our first date?

01:18:55.426 --> 01:18:58.908
You mean when we went
and saw music at that friend
of yours' thing?

01:18:58.951 --> 01:19:00.561
You thought that was a date?

01:19:01.780 --> 01:19:03.390
Kind of did, yeah.

01:19:03.434 --> 01:19:04.696
Aw.

01:19:07.612 --> 01:19:09.353
Are you a lesbian?

01:19:11.050 --> 01:19:12.486
No.

01:19:21.931 --> 01:19:24.150
You're beautiful,

01:19:24.194 --> 01:19:26.631
and you have,
like, angry eyes.

01:19:31.505 --> 01:19:33.116
Are you gonna leave now?

01:19:37.773 --> 01:19:39.687
I think so.

01:19:39.731 --> 01:19:41.820
What?

01:19:41.864 --> 01:19:43.256
-Yeah.

01:19:44.518 --> 01:19:45.868
Aren't you gonna get in trouble?

01:19:45.911 --> 01:19:48.131
No, no one comes in here
till noon tomorrow.

01:19:53.049 --> 01:19:54.877
What'll I wear to sleep in?

01:19:54.920 --> 01:19:57.488
Oh, I'm sure
we could find something.

01:20:04.364 --> 01:20:06.453
I like the way you smell.

01:20:09.239 --> 01:20:11.241
Are you gonna tell me
that name you have for me?

01:20:11.284 --> 01:20:12.677
Never.

01:20:12.720 --> 01:20:14.244
Fuck!

01:20:20.032 --> 01:20:22.513
Then I'm gonna look
for something to wear.

01:20:24.558 --> 01:20:27.039
You should get food.

01:20:27.083 --> 01:20:28.345
And wine.

01:20:31.217 --> 01:20:32.784
So, there.

-Super turns me on.

01:22:52.576 --> 01:22:54.056

With women? Is that what
you're trying to ask me?

01:22:56.449 --> 01:22:59.670
Yes, with women.

01:22:59.713 --> 01:23:02.368
Uh, I don't really know.
I don't have a specific type.

01:23:02.412 --> 01:23:03.674
It's specific to the person.

01:23:03.717 --> 01:23:05.023
Okay.

01:23:08.331 --> 01:23:09.854
What about her?

01:23:10.855 --> 01:23:12.683
She's super-pretty.

01:23:15.425 --> 01:23:17.557
I mean,
I've never talked to her,
so I don't know.

01:23:17.601 --> 01:23:18.776
What about her?

01:23:21.648 --> 01:23:22.780
-Nah.

01:23:22.823 --> 01:23:24.564
Hm-mm. Physically, anyway, no.

01:23:25.565 --> 01:23:26.958
What about this girl?

01:23:27.002 --> 01:23:28.220
What girl?

01:23:29.352 --> 01:23:30.570
The girl you're dating.

01:23:30.614 --> 01:23:32.485
Oh, I don't know
that we're dating.

01:23:32.529 --> 01:23:35.314
I mean, dating can have
a lot of connotations.

01:23:35.358 --> 01:23:37.664
Okay, the girl
you're whatever-ing with.

01:23:38.665 --> 01:23:40.363
You mean Ali?

01:23:40.406 --> 01:23:41.886
-Mm-hmm.

01:23:43.235 --> 01:23:44.671
Let me see a picture of her.

01:23:44.715 --> 01:23:46.021

01:23:46.064 --> 01:23:48.458
Come on. I know
you have a picture.

01:23:48.501 --> 01:23:50.373
-I totally have a picture.
Uh-huh.

Wow. She's beautiful.

01:23:59.947 --> 01:24:03.734
Well, yeah. What did you think?
I was gonna have bad taste?

01:24:03.777 --> 01:24:06.998
I mean, I chose you, didn't I?

01:24:12.003 --> 01:24:13.352

weird thing to say.

Why would I wanna
eat a smiley face?

01:24:40.553 --> 01:24:43.730
I think you should think
about that question.

01:24:43.774 --> 01:24:45.819
-Why wouldn't you...
-I did think about it
before I asked it.

01:24:45.863 --> 01:24:47.778
