WEBVTT

00:24.984 --> 00:29.238
- God...

00:32.533 --> 00:34.493
God, what the hell
is happening?

00:34.577 --> 00:36.620
What, are you
prepping for end times?

00:36.704 --> 00:38.414
I thought we could have
some breakfast together

00:38.497 --> 00:39.832
and then go on a hike.

00:39.915 --> 00:42.084
Why? Oh, my God.
What did I do wrong?

00:42.168 --> 00:44.211
I lost your fun bet. Remember?

00:44.295 --> 00:46.964
- I owe you some family bonding.

00:47.047 --> 00:48.632
It sounds like family bondage.

00:48.716 --> 00:50.176
Mm...

00:50.259 --> 00:52.678
You know what's fun?
Is a nice,

00:52.762 --> 00:56.474
slow roll, 10 AM start
and chips for breakfast.

00:56.557 --> 00:58.100
Yeah. Well, I found
some environmentally

00:58.184 --> 00:59.852
significant wetlands nearby
and you and I

00:59.935 --> 01:01.395
- are gonna check 'em out. 'Kay?

01:01.479 --> 01:02.980
Do you remember
that the cottage

01:03.063 --> 01:05.149
is about enjoying nature
and not about, like,

01:05.232 --> 01:07.234
putting it under a microscope?

01:07.318 --> 01:08.736
See, that is the problem.

01:08.819 --> 01:10.571
People have been
enjoying nature so much

01:10.654 --> 01:12.072
that the planet is
a trash can fire.

01:12.156 --> 01:14.366
So, we are prepping
for end times.

01:14.450 --> 01:18.662
Okay, I'm gonna need some
coffee and some chips.

01:18.746 --> 01:20.456
- Where's the, um--

01:20.539 --> 01:22.458
Mugs are in the upper cabinets
for better flow.

01:22.541 --> 01:24.585
- Okay. And the--
- Snacks are on the top shelf

01:24.668 --> 01:27.129
to discourage overindulgence.
And ants.

01:27.213 --> 01:29.298
Both of which,
essential ingredients

01:29.381 --> 01:30.716
to the cottage experience.

01:30.800 --> 01:32.051
Ew.

01:34.845 --> 01:37.181
So, you brought
a label maker, did ya?

01:38.265 --> 01:41.227
This is how you cottage.

01:41.310 --> 01:43.854
You sit back, you relax.

01:43.938 --> 01:45.648
You do nothing.

01:45.731 --> 01:48.484
Okay, doing nothing
is not relaxing for me, okay?

01:48.567 --> 01:50.778
The planet is on fire,
there's systemic racism,

01:50.861 --> 01:52.488
economic inequality
and doing nothing

01:52.571 --> 01:54.198
- is the reason for all that.
- Okay-- I'm sorry.

01:54.281 --> 01:56.200
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm puttin' it back in.

01:56.283 --> 01:58.244
Okay? I take it back.

01:58.327 --> 02:01.413
I won't cottage-splain anymore.

02:01.497 --> 02:05.793
All right. Why don't we start
our bondage with a morning dip?

02:05.876 --> 02:09.421
It's environmentally friendly,
low economic impact.

02:09.505 --> 02:10.798
Water's so pretty.

02:10.881 --> 02:12.508
Nah, I'm good.

02:12.591 --> 02:13.843
What do you mean?
Isn't swimming,

02:13.926 --> 02:15.845
like, your thing?

02:15.928 --> 02:18.430
Lake water's gross, okay?
You can't see the bottom.

02:18.514 --> 02:21.559
"Jaws", uh, "Lake Placid"
and seaweed's nasty.

02:21.642 --> 02:23.477
Ah-kay...

02:23.561 --> 02:26.063
- New bondage plan.

02:26.146 --> 02:28.357
Why don't we hike
up to Raven's Rock

02:28.440 --> 02:29.942
and you can swim there.

02:30.025 --> 02:32.278
It's the clearest,
deepest part of the lake,

02:32.361 --> 02:33.988
nothing nasty to touch

02:34.071 --> 02:36.115
and you can see
all the sharks coming.

02:37.700 --> 02:40.327
Fine, as long as you
don't spend the day

02:40.411 --> 02:41.954
obsessing over Maisy
and the cottage.

02:42.037 --> 02:44.081
Pfft. Deal. Done.

02:45.875 --> 02:48.878
I just have, like, a teensy
little errand to run, first.

03:02.516 --> 03:03.976
Thank you.

03:04.059 --> 03:05.561
Thank you so much

03:05.644 --> 03:07.021
for making me
Boathouse president

03:07.104 --> 03:08.397
for the 7th consecutive year!

03:08.480 --> 03:10.274
Still too needy.

03:10.357 --> 03:12.651
Winning by acclaim means that
no one ran against you.

03:12.735 --> 03:15.279
What are you thanking them for?
Political apathy?

03:15.362 --> 03:18.073
More McDormand. Less Hathaway.

03:18.157 --> 03:19.909
Okay.

03:24.121 --> 03:25.497
No!

03:25.581 --> 03:27.249
Victory cookies?

03:27.333 --> 03:28.667
That's a big flex, Mom.

03:28.751 --> 03:30.336
Oh...
Is somebody cranky because

03:30.419 --> 03:32.087
- they miss their girlfriend?
- No.

03:32.171 --> 03:34.590
I'm just sick of lifeguard
training, Dad's obsessed.

03:34.673 --> 03:37.134
Well, stop trash-talking
your parents to Sara.

03:37.217 --> 03:39.261
I see you texting her
all morning.

03:41.972 --> 03:43.432
Have you seen my stopwatch?

03:44.224 --> 03:45.684
Go easy on Killian. Okay?

03:45.768 --> 03:47.478
- I think he misses Sara.
- Yeah.

03:47.561 --> 03:49.313
He misses dry-humping her
in the basement.

03:49.396 --> 03:51.315
Opal. We talked about
boundaries.

03:51.398 --> 03:53.025
Let your brother
dry hump in peace.

03:53.108 --> 03:54.485
Listen.

03:54.568 --> 03:56.362
Killian is gonna
win Junior Lifeguard.

03:56.445 --> 03:57.821
I'm gonna
be re-elected president

03:57.905 --> 03:59.990
and then we can renovate
this dump. Okay?

04:00.074 --> 04:04.161
But remember, to truly win,
we must embrace loss.

04:04.244 --> 04:07.331
I think maybe no more Brené
Brown podcasts for you, okay?

04:07.414 --> 04:09.750
- Have fun.

04:11.877 --> 04:15.047
Oh, hun, I love it.

04:15.130 --> 04:17.132
It's a bit small,
don't you think?

04:17.216 --> 04:18.801
Oh. No.

04:20.469 --> 04:22.012
This is for me.

04:23.347 --> 04:25.516
And the shoulder pads.

04:25.599 --> 04:27.309
- Yeah.
- Okay.

04:27.393 --> 04:29.186
Convince Jayne to run
for Boathouse president?

04:29.269 --> 04:30.938
That's your teensy errand?

04:31.021 --> 04:33.065
Well, I can't run because
I don't own property.

04:33.148 --> 04:34.525
But, if Jayne
becomes president,

04:34.608 --> 04:36.986
she can veto Maisy's
reno easy-peasy.

04:39.238 --> 04:40.864
Jayne's family's owned
a cottage on the lake

04:40.948 --> 04:42.700
as long as we have,
so she'll understand

04:42.783 --> 04:45.160
the importance of protecting
heritage properties.

04:45.244 --> 04:46.829
Why don't you just talk
to Maisy instead

04:46.912 --> 04:48.414
of going behind her back?

04:48.497 --> 04:50.290
Billie, to fight a monster,

04:50.374 --> 04:52.835
you get an even bigger monster.
All right?

04:52.918 --> 04:54.628
Godzilla vs. King Kong.

04:54.712 --> 04:56.130
Yeah. Judging from Games Night,

04:56.213 --> 04:57.589
Jayne's more gecko
than Godzilla.

04:57.673 --> 04:59.383
Oh, not when we were kids.

04:59.466 --> 05:01.427
No, she always tried
to get Maisy

05:01.510 --> 05:03.137
to switch rooms with me
because it was easier

05:03.220 --> 05:04.805
to climb out my bedroom window.

05:04.888 --> 05:06.890
So, she told my dad
that she caught me

05:06.974 --> 05:09.393
pulling the padge
to Maisy's yearbook photo--

05:09.476 --> 05:11.186
Which, disgusting.

05:11.270 --> 05:13.856
My dad moved me down
to the basement the next day.

05:13.939 --> 05:15.858
No, Jayne is
the original Maisy,

05:15.941 --> 05:18.110
I just gotta figure out a way
to reawaken the beast within.

05:20.154 --> 05:23.032
Ooh. Is someone
leaving Kissian unread?

05:23.115 --> 05:25.034
He has a girlfriend, remember?

05:25.117 --> 05:28.287
And, I can't tell if
he's being flirty or friendly.

05:28.370 --> 05:30.122
You should honeydick him
if you want to find out.

05:30.205 --> 05:32.624
- Honeydick?
- Yes. To honeydick,

05:32.708 --> 05:34.918
means to hang out with
somebody, work up a flirt.

05:35.002 --> 05:36.754
And, if he makes a move,
he's a dirt bag.

05:36.837 --> 05:38.547
But if he comes clean,
he's decent.

05:38.630 --> 05:40.340
Or, I could just ask Killian.

05:40.424 --> 05:42.426
Yes, but then Killian would
know that you like him

05:42.509 --> 05:44.136
and we never
give away our power.

05:45.471 --> 05:47.264
- Ready?
- No. But do I have a choice?

05:47.347 --> 05:49.266
- No.
- Great.

05:49.349 --> 05:50.768
Well,
I mean, you have free will

05:50.851 --> 05:52.311
but how far
is that gonna get ya?

05:52.394 --> 05:53.771
Not far enough.

06:02.488 --> 06:04.156
Push through, son.
You can do it!

06:04.239 --> 06:05.783
Feel the burn, bud.
Let's go, let's go!

06:05.866 --> 06:08.243
- Oh, God!

06:08.327 --> 06:10.287
Still need to shave
a second off your freestyle

06:10.370 --> 06:12.706
if you wanna beat the quads
for Junior Lifeguard, son.

06:12.790 --> 06:14.249
I'm just not feeling it today.

06:14.333 --> 06:15.959
Feelings aren't facts.

06:16.043 --> 06:18.253
We push past them to reach
our full potential.

06:19.546 --> 06:21.715
Hey. Your mom said
you're missing Sara.

06:21.799 --> 06:24.343
Why don't we invite her up
to watch you compete?

06:24.426 --> 06:27.012
No. That's more pressure.

06:27.096 --> 06:29.223
What if I lose? I don't
want her to see me choke.

06:29.306 --> 06:31.558
Sara will support you,
win or lose.

06:31.642 --> 06:33.435
She stuck by
your chronic ringworm.

06:33.519 --> 06:37.356
Listen, our partners love us
at our best and our worst.

06:38.899 --> 06:40.943
Vulnerability is
the secret sexy, son.

06:41.026 --> 06:42.611
Now, get back at her.

06:42.694 --> 06:44.154
Let's go. C'mon!

06:50.035 --> 06:51.829
Here. Have some.

06:51.912 --> 06:53.497
- Thanks.

06:53.580 --> 06:55.916
Breakfast kind of got
interrupted this morning.

07:02.631 --> 07:06.051
Huh. Killian wants to
know if I've seen you.

07:06.135 --> 07:07.594
Says he's been messaging.

07:08.720 --> 07:10.514
Forgot to text him back.

07:10.597 --> 07:12.015
Think he wants me
to help him train

07:12.099 --> 07:13.559
for lifeguard trials
or something

07:13.642 --> 07:16.562
but um, I'm hanging
with Justin today.

07:16.645 --> 07:18.856
Well, take Killian with you.

07:18.939 --> 07:20.399
He's super into you.

07:20.482 --> 07:22.151
And, if he keeps training,

07:22.234 --> 07:24.194
my sisters will never win
Junior Lifeguard, which...

07:24.278 --> 07:25.904
you know, means three bitches
helping themselves

07:25.988 --> 07:27.906
to my sativa all summer.

07:28.407 --> 07:30.325
Uh...

07:30.409 --> 07:33.328
I'm sorry. It's kind of, like,
a birth father-daughter thing.

07:33.412 --> 07:37.207
What happened to the cottage's
vintage lumber camp vibes?

07:37.291 --> 07:40.502
O-M-jeepers, I couldn't wait
to just gut the whole place.

07:40.586 --> 07:42.671
Don't you just love our
new granite counter tops

07:42.754 --> 07:44.840
and the coconut
herringbone backsplash?

07:44.923 --> 07:47.634
We wanted contemporary,
but we like hints of Tiki.

07:47.718 --> 07:49.469
We thought,
"We love fusion cuisine.

07:49.553 --> 07:51.763
Why not try fusion design?"

07:51.847 --> 07:55.601
So fun.
It's so much to take in.

07:55.684 --> 07:58.729
Took forever to finish, what
with four girls running around

07:58.812 --> 08:00.898
while trying to buy out my
sister's half of the cottage.

08:00.981 --> 08:02.774
- Yeah--
- Thank God,

08:02.858 --> 08:05.277
my nephew got kidnapped
while backpacking in Cartagena

08:05.360 --> 08:07.196
so she needed
to ransom him fast

08:07.279 --> 08:08.739
because now we have
our dream cottage!

08:08.822 --> 08:10.115
- Yay!
- Yay.

08:10.199 --> 08:12.284
Except for my party pontoon.

08:12.367 --> 08:13.869
- Let it go, babe.
- Uh, what?

08:13.952 --> 08:16.205
No, what happened
to the party pontoon?

08:16.288 --> 08:17.623
Maisy had the board
vote against it.

08:17.706 --> 08:19.499
- She didn't...

08:19.583 --> 08:21.210
Oh, yeah.
Said it was an eyesore.

08:21.293 --> 08:23.503
Oh... I guess what
the president wants,

08:23.587 --> 08:24.838
the president gets.

08:24.922 --> 08:26.798
That is weird, you guys.

08:26.882 --> 08:28.717
That's so weird because
Maisy's adding

08:28.800 --> 08:30.510
a motorized dock
to her property.

08:34.556 --> 08:37.809
Oh. Well, um...

08:37.893 --> 08:39.353
the wood's probably
organic or something.

08:39.436 --> 08:40.854
Maisy always has a good reason.

08:40.938 --> 08:42.481
Yeah, no, totally,
totally, she does.

08:42.564 --> 08:44.566
Always. But, it's just--

08:44.650 --> 08:46.235
God, that's so strange she
didn't say

08:46.318 --> 08:48.195
- anything to you about it.
- Right?

08:48.278 --> 08:49.655
- Yes.
- We spent, like, hours

08:49.738 --> 08:51.490
and hours discussing my reno.

08:51.573 --> 08:53.784
She was the one who suggested
painting this accent wall

08:53.867 --> 08:55.118
this sunny shade
of highlighter.

08:55.202 --> 08:56.453
Damn.

08:56.536 --> 08:58.288
Just don't look at it too long.

08:58.372 --> 08:59.748
You know...

09:01.041 --> 09:03.919
You should run for
Boathouse Board president.

09:04.002 --> 09:06.255
- I'm serious, Jayne,

09:06.338 --> 09:08.632
you would have the power
to veto Maisy's dock.

09:09.424 --> 09:10.926
Lovejoy is right.

09:11.009 --> 09:12.427
I mean, you didn't get
your perfect reno.

09:12.511 --> 09:14.346
Why should Maisy get hers?

09:14.429 --> 09:16.223
But guys,

09:16.306 --> 09:18.767
as outgoing V.P., wouldn't
this be, like, treason?

09:18.850 --> 09:20.602
No, no. What?
No, no, no, no, no, no.

09:20.686 --> 09:23.397
Not treason, not treason.
Listen to me, Jayne. Okay?

09:23.480 --> 09:26.942
The Boathouse presidency
is your legacy.

09:27.025 --> 09:30.779
Your great-grandfather founded
the Boathouse Fishing Club.

09:31.822 --> 09:35.951
He banned women from joining
because of their tiny brains.

09:36.034 --> 09:38.203
But your grandmother
started the first

09:38.287 --> 09:40.497
Boathouse barbecue committee.

09:40.580 --> 09:43.542
She banned ethnic food
for its lustful properties.

09:43.625 --> 09:45.168
I didn't try sushi
for the first time

09:45.252 --> 09:47.170
- until I was, like, 30.
- Okay, Jayne.

09:47.254 --> 09:49.131
We're gonna lean away
from the bigotry

09:49.214 --> 09:52.009
and we're gonna lean into
the leadership. All right?

09:52.092 --> 09:53.802
This is your chance,

09:53.885 --> 09:57.014
your chance to set
a great example for your girls.

09:57.097 --> 09:59.182
Do you want them
to be the kind of women

09:59.266 --> 10:02.477
who lock other women
in the shit house?

10:02.561 --> 10:05.314
We can turn
this brown upside-down, babe.

10:05.397 --> 10:06.940
Come on, Jayne.

10:07.024 --> 10:08.817
Where's the girl
that bullied me every summer?

10:08.900 --> 10:10.736
Where's that hellcat
I married, huh?

10:12.154 --> 10:14.239
She's right here.

10:14.323 --> 10:16.033
Get ready...

10:16.116 --> 10:18.493
for the summer of Jayne!

10:18.577 --> 10:20.495
- Mm!

10:20.579 --> 10:23.165
- Woo! Smoothies all 'round!
- Yeah!

10:23.248 --> 10:26.126
Woo! Pontoon!

10:28.253 --> 10:31.631
- What is that smell?

10:31.715 --> 10:33.467
I made up a quick batch
of pickled herring

10:33.550 --> 10:35.385
from fish caught
by my chickens.

10:35.469 --> 10:37.304
I couldn't resist
sneaking a bite.

10:37.387 --> 10:38.680
- Mm? Mm?
- No.

10:38.764 --> 10:40.098
No?

10:40.182 --> 10:42.017
Chickens are very
good fishermen.

10:42.100 --> 10:44.186
On Orust Island in Sweden,

10:44.269 --> 10:46.063
the chickens survive
on fish guts

10:46.146 --> 10:47.814
that they pull from
the fish themselves.

10:47.898 --> 10:49.399
They're much more
independent than

10:49.483 --> 10:51.109
their North American cousins
but my hens,

10:51.193 --> 10:53.320
Sven and Lars,
are quick learners.

10:54.988 --> 10:57.366
Why don't we get started
on today's business?

10:57.449 --> 10:59.076
Mm-hm.

10:59.159 --> 11:00.744
If you could just sign
my term renewal papers,

11:00.827 --> 11:02.579
then we can take a quick vote
on my renovation.

11:02.662 --> 11:05.040
I really need to nail down
that contractor.

11:05.123 --> 11:07.417
- Um.

11:07.501 --> 11:10.545
Well, the deadline for
candidates to submit is, uh...

11:10.629 --> 11:11.963
noon today.

11:12.047 --> 11:14.633
I cannot sign it until then.

11:14.716 --> 11:16.134
Well, if somebody else
was gonna run,

11:16.218 --> 11:17.803
they would have
submitted by now.

11:17.886 --> 11:21.807
I'm sorry.
Protocol is important. Mm?

11:22.641 --> 11:24.518
Right. I understand.

11:24.601 --> 11:27.604
Seniors need their rituals,
it helps with the confusion.

11:29.272 --> 11:31.358
We wait until noon.

11:37.989 --> 11:39.574
Wait, I thought we were
going to Raven's Rock.

11:39.658 --> 11:42.702
Yes. I just want to see
the look on Maisy's face

11:42.786 --> 11:45.122
when Jayne announces that
she's running for president.

11:45.205 --> 11:46.540
How is this not

11:46.623 --> 11:48.417
obsessing over Maisy
and the cottage?

11:48.500 --> 11:50.502
I'm gonna be five minutes.
I swear, just five minutes.

11:50.585 --> 11:52.504
Dip your toes in the water.
It's nice and shallow.

11:52.587 --> 11:54.423
It'll be like a little warm up
for Raven's Rock.

11:54.506 --> 11:56.258
And, grab us a couple of
sandwiches from the canteen.

11:56.341 --> 11:57.801
- Justin, I--
- I love you, BRB.

12:13.775 --> 12:16.653
Well, it doesn't look like
anyone else is gonna run

12:16.736 --> 12:18.905
- so why don't we--

12:59.196 --> 13:01.281
I'd like
to declare my candidacy

13:01.364 --> 13:03.867
for Boat House president.

13:15.086 --> 13:17.339
- Oh, my God!

13:17.422 --> 13:19.090
You scared the shit out of me!

13:20.717 --> 13:22.260
Well, that's the idea.

13:22.344 --> 13:23.762
Don't you love scary movies?

13:23.845 --> 13:27.265
Slasher movies,
not monster movies.

13:27.349 --> 13:30.393
Noted. Hey, um,
is your phone off?

13:30.477 --> 13:34.022
I've been trying to text you
but it's been radio silence.

13:34.105 --> 13:36.441
Uh... Yeah, I turned it off.

13:37.692 --> 13:40.028
Someone told me to do nothing.

13:40.111 --> 13:41.780
- Sweet.

13:41.863 --> 13:43.990
No, it's just, um,
I could super use a swim coach

13:44.074 --> 13:45.825
that's not drinking
the TED talk Kool-Aid.

13:45.909 --> 13:47.285
Killian!

13:47.369 --> 13:49.246
Let's go, bud,
come on! Pick it up!

13:49.329 --> 13:51.748
I already promised Justin
I'd go swimming with him

13:51.831 --> 13:53.166
at Raven's Rock.

13:53.250 --> 13:55.502
Well, maybe we could
go another time.

13:57.128 --> 13:58.755
Let me know.

13:58.838 --> 14:01.174
And, turn on your phone,
you weirdo.

14:08.932 --> 14:12.185
Jayne, I had to beg you
to be my V.P.

14:12.269 --> 14:14.646
Where's this coming from?

14:14.729 --> 14:16.648
Did something happen
at Games Night?

14:16.731 --> 14:18.358
You had a Games Night
without us?

14:18.441 --> 14:19.901
Because the last one
you went to,

14:19.985 --> 14:21.236
you fucked Whoreen
and broke Mummy's heart.

14:21.319 --> 14:22.696
Save it for your blog, Claire.

14:23.530 --> 14:25.448
Jayne. What's going on?

14:25.532 --> 14:27.617
Maisy, I love being your VP.

14:27.701 --> 14:31.079
I love supporting you,
listening to you.

14:31.162 --> 14:32.872
I love you.

14:32.956 --> 14:36.042
But, I want to follow
in my family's footsteps.

14:36.126 --> 14:37.752
Wasn't theirs just a...

14:37.836 --> 14:40.922
skosh racist,
homophobic and misogynist?

14:41.006 --> 14:43.717
Well, I want to follow in
their fun footsteps.

14:43.800 --> 14:45.802
Their flip-flop steps.

14:45.885 --> 14:48.138
There's so many rules
at the lake now.

14:48.221 --> 14:50.974
No noise,
no tubing, no pontoons.

14:52.100 --> 14:53.768
I want to bring fun
back to the lake.

14:53.852 --> 14:55.729
Fun is important,

14:55.812 --> 14:57.230
and so is debate.

14:57.314 --> 14:59.274
Both have been central
to my presidency.

15:00.650 --> 15:02.611
But your granny's idea of fun
was keeping Catholics

15:02.694 --> 15:04.446
off the lake
for being too fertile.

15:04.529 --> 15:06.781
My 16 cousins and I
were directly affected.

15:08.908 --> 15:11.536
I-- I just wanted to give
my girls a better example.

15:11.620 --> 15:13.580
That's what every parent wants

15:13.663 --> 15:17.459
and what every president wants,
to lead by example.

15:17.542 --> 15:19.419
But sometimes,
that means following those

15:19.502 --> 15:21.296
who set a better example.

15:21.379 --> 15:22.672
Oh.

15:25.675 --> 15:27.052
Yeah.

15:27.761 --> 15:29.179
Thank you...

15:29.262 --> 15:31.222
for reminding me
how unfit I am to lead.

15:31.306 --> 15:33.808
She's folding like
a fuckin' lawn chair!

15:33.892 --> 15:35.268
You're always there to help me.

15:35.352 --> 15:37.646
- Mm...
- Guide me...

15:37.729 --> 15:39.105
Hold me.

15:39.189 --> 15:40.732
We will hold
a town hall tonight

15:40.815 --> 15:42.233
and then we can have
the election then.

15:42.317 --> 15:43.735
Fuck!

15:43.818 --> 15:45.570
Everyone will have
a chance to speak,

15:45.654 --> 15:49.366
ask questions and then we
will vote by a show of hands.

15:49.449 --> 15:50.909
May the best candidate win!

15:50.992 --> 15:52.327
Oh, she will.

15:56.081 --> 15:57.332
Bad move.

15:57.415 --> 15:58.792
You woke the beast.

15:58.875 --> 16:00.418
Please, tell Maisy
I never meant--

16:00.502 --> 16:02.003
Oh, no.

16:02.087 --> 16:03.421
I meant me.

16:13.390 --> 16:15.058
Hey.

16:15.141 --> 16:17.143
Okay, they only had
the Triple-Decker-Clubhouse.

16:17.227 --> 16:19.396
I got a little bit of bad news.

16:19.479 --> 16:21.815
I can't go with you
to Raven's Rock.

16:21.898 --> 16:24.025
I know. Jayne's about
to drop out of the race

16:24.109 --> 16:28.154
and I gotta go give her a pep
talk and maybe an upper or two.

16:28.238 --> 16:29.698
I'm sorry.

16:29.781 --> 16:32.701
I am,
but why don't you take Killian?

16:32.784 --> 16:35.453
It'd be like rescuing
a sad puppy.

16:35.537 --> 16:38.540
What 16 year old wants
to meditate with their father?

16:38.623 --> 16:40.709
- In public.
- No, I already turned him down

16:40.792 --> 16:42.168
because I was waiting for you.

16:42.252 --> 16:44.087
And, I'd look completely
unhinged, now,

16:44.170 --> 16:46.548
- with this Hungry Man picnic.

16:46.631 --> 16:48.091
Taking Killian to Raven's Rock?

16:48.174 --> 16:50.427
Perfect place to honeydick him.

16:50.510 --> 16:52.887
It's private. It's secluded.

16:52.971 --> 16:55.306
So, if he wants
to make a move, oh yeah,

16:55.390 --> 16:57.100
he's gonna make it there.

16:57.183 --> 16:59.811
So, you're suggesting
I go to a completely

16:59.894 --> 17:02.731
secluded place
with a guy I just met?

17:02.814 --> 17:04.733
Stellar parenting.

17:04.816 --> 17:06.943
Look, Billie, if Jayne wins,

17:07.026 --> 17:08.737
Maisy's reno's over.

17:08.820 --> 17:11.281
We can save the family cottage.

17:11.364 --> 17:13.324
Good luck with your gecko.

17:13.408 --> 17:14.659
I'm out.

17:14.743 --> 17:15.994
Well, Billie, wait.

17:17.912 --> 17:19.330
Can I get a sandwich?

17:19.414 --> 17:20.957
Like,
even a half Decker, maybe?

17:21.040 --> 17:23.084
I'm just feeling so hangry.

17:23.168 --> 17:24.669
No, you're right. You're right.

17:24.753 --> 17:26.504
Empty carbs are the enemy.

18:02.123 --> 18:03.416
- Whoa.

18:03.500 --> 18:05.084
What was that about?

18:06.002 --> 18:09.798
I couldn't take any more of my
dad's vulnerability coaching.

18:09.881 --> 18:12.300
Don't let it tip!

18:12.383 --> 18:13.635
Woah.

18:13.718 --> 18:14.969
What was that about?

18:15.678 --> 18:18.181
Lake water freaks me out.

18:18.264 --> 18:19.974
Is that why
you didn't text me back?

18:22.143 --> 18:24.687
Justin was taking me
to Raven's Rock to get over it.

18:26.231 --> 18:28.483
Well, summer will suck
if you won't get in the water.

18:30.443 --> 18:32.237
I'll take you to Raven's.

18:32.946 --> 18:35.532
I do owe you one after
my shit locker freak out.

18:36.282 --> 18:37.700
Cool.

18:38.743 --> 18:43.456
I just have, like,
one teensy errand to run first.

18:48.962 --> 18:50.296
Hey.

18:51.089 --> 18:52.966
You got Killian
to stop training.

18:53.049 --> 18:54.884
I knew I could count on you.

18:54.968 --> 18:56.344
I'm only hanging out with him

18:56.427 --> 18:57.846
for a couple of hours to
honeydick him.

18:58.388 --> 18:59.806
Do you mean "honeypot"?

18:59.889 --> 19:01.766
Using your lady wiles
to set a trap?

19:02.350 --> 19:03.852
Honeypot!

19:03.935 --> 19:06.271
That makes a lot more sense.

19:06.354 --> 19:08.481
All these Triple Deckers
are yours if you help me.

19:08.565 --> 19:10.149
- What do you need?
- I need a cute skirt

19:10.233 --> 19:11.693
and a drive-by glow up.

19:11.776 --> 19:13.194
And I've only got,
like, a few minutes.

19:15.822 --> 19:17.448
Just don't touch the hair.

19:17.532 --> 19:19.158
Killian?

19:19.242 --> 19:20.994
Killian!

19:21.077 --> 19:23.663
Was our wood stain Cherry Pop
or a Walnut Brûlée?

19:23.746 --> 19:25.373
Got the warehouse on hold.

19:25.456 --> 19:27.709
The vision board's
in Michael Bassbender, hun.

19:27.792 --> 19:29.377
Ah.

19:29.460 --> 19:31.421
I pushed Killian too far.

19:31.504 --> 19:33.506
He snuck off during
my guided meditation.

19:33.590 --> 19:35.592
Oh, well, of course he did.

19:35.675 --> 19:38.011
What teenager
wants to meditate?

19:38.595 --> 19:42.557
Can you believe that Jayne
is running for president?

19:42.640 --> 19:44.767
I need you to sign some
hockey crap for Whoreen

19:44.851 --> 19:46.644
just to win her over.

19:46.728 --> 19:49.105
She might vote for you if you
stop calling her Whoreen.

19:49.188 --> 19:50.607
I checked on Michael Bassbender

19:50.690 --> 19:52.025
but the vision board's gone.

19:52.108 --> 19:53.818
Well, who was in
the office last?

19:53.902 --> 19:56.362
We were all in there
cleaning up after Games Night.

19:57.322 --> 19:58.615
Sardines.

20:00.825 --> 20:02.243
Justin!

20:02.327 --> 20:04.412
Justin must have found it.

20:04.495 --> 20:06.831
He convinced Jayne to run.

20:06.915 --> 20:09.792
Her T-shirt reeked
of gay make-over montage.

20:09.876 --> 20:11.210
Barry, I'll call you back.

20:11.294 --> 20:13.504
We've got a situation.

20:13.588 --> 20:15.256
My bedazzler better
not be missing.

20:15.882 --> 20:18.051
What happens to our building
permits if Jayne wins?

20:18.134 --> 20:19.469
It's okay. It's okay.

20:19.552 --> 20:20.970
I just need to take Justin out.

20:21.054 --> 20:23.640
Without him,
her campaign crumbles.

20:25.600 --> 20:27.185
I'll get the dustpan.

20:27.268 --> 20:28.895
- C'mon, babe.

20:30.104 --> 20:31.940
Why'd you make me do it?

20:32.023 --> 20:33.858
Maisy's an amazing president.

20:33.942 --> 20:36.402
She's smart. She's organized.

20:36.486 --> 20:39.238
She's beautiful. She's strong.

20:39.322 --> 20:40.990
You're strong, too, babe!

20:41.074 --> 20:42.450
Jayne okay?

20:42.533 --> 20:43.785
No, she locked herself
in the bathroom.

20:43.868 --> 20:45.954
- Jayne, come on.

20:46.037 --> 20:47.747
Unlock the door.

20:47.830 --> 20:50.083
It got stuck
when I slammed it

20:50.166 --> 20:52.126
- but it's what I deserve.
- No.

20:52.210 --> 20:54.587
I should just stay in
here until the election's over.

20:54.671 --> 20:56.005
- No.
- Looks like you could use

20:56.089 --> 20:57.548
a little blunt force.

20:57.632 --> 20:59.133
- For sure, yeah.
- Yeah.

21:00.009 --> 21:01.844
Maisy's been sending
board members

21:01.928 --> 21:03.846
crying to the washroom
for years.

21:03.930 --> 21:07.392
- Here. Hold this for me?
- Yeah, of course.

21:07.475 --> 21:09.310
You gotta pound it hard.

21:09.394 --> 21:12.063
Or we could work up to it
with a lot of eye contact.

21:14.941 --> 21:16.567
Some sick delts, there, Rile.

21:16.651 --> 21:18.277
What do you bench, bro?

21:18.361 --> 21:19.946
- Woah.

21:21.364 --> 21:22.615
Oh...

21:23.866 --> 21:26.411
Hey, hey, buddy.

21:29.455 --> 21:32.375
I'm sorry, Justin. I can't.

21:32.458 --> 21:35.378
Oh, man. But what about
the summer of Jayne?

21:35.461 --> 21:37.547
Remember? Summer of Jayne?

21:39.007 --> 21:40.842
And our pontoon.

21:40.925 --> 21:42.844
Oh, fuck your pontoon, Wayne!

21:42.927 --> 21:46.180
Hey, I-- I know where Maisy
keeps the gluten-free donuts.

21:46.264 --> 21:48.391
They taste like sand,
but they're frosted.

21:48.891 --> 21:50.143
Okay.

21:50.226 --> 21:51.477
You want some sand?

21:52.270 --> 21:54.188
- Yeah.
- Yeah, okay. Go get some sand.

21:54.272 --> 21:55.523
Okay.

21:58.860 --> 22:01.529
- It's our pontoon.
- No.

22:01.612 --> 22:03.489
Shit.

22:03.573 --> 22:05.616
Shit, Wayne.

22:05.700 --> 22:08.286
Wayne, Wayne, Wayne.

22:09.245 --> 22:10.496
Wayne.

22:10.580 --> 22:13.374
- Hello.
- Sometimes...

22:13.458 --> 22:15.585
ya gotta use
a little blunt force.

22:18.129 --> 22:19.881
Do you know what
two J's make, Wayne?

22:19.964 --> 22:21.841
Jjj. Jj-Jj.

22:21.924 --> 22:23.885
No.

22:27.096 --> 22:29.599
Wh-- Wh. Wayne?

22:29.682 --> 22:30.933
Wayne.

22:32.226 --> 22:33.978
Get ready for
the summer of Wayne!

22:34.062 --> 22:35.438
- Summer of Wayne!
- Summer of Wayne!

22:35.521 --> 22:37.023
Summer of Wayne!

22:38.608 --> 22:40.318
- Oh, wow!

22:40.401 --> 22:41.819
Summer of Wayne!

22:41.903 --> 22:44.197
- That feels dislocated.

22:54.332 --> 22:55.708
Okay.

23:05.510 --> 23:07.053
What?

23:07.136 --> 23:09.138
Nothing.

23:09.222 --> 23:10.723
You look nice.

23:10.807 --> 23:12.391
I just hope Olive's
okay with you

23:12.475 --> 23:13.810
getting her clothes
a bit dirty.

23:18.231 --> 23:19.607
That's a lot of texts.

23:20.233 --> 23:21.484
Do you need to call?

23:22.193 --> 23:23.444
It's all good.

23:24.112 --> 23:25.446
Hm.

23:26.948 --> 23:28.699
So is this where you kill me?

23:29.700 --> 23:32.453
This is the path
to Raven's Rock.

23:32.537 --> 23:34.288
That's where I kill you.

23:34.372 --> 23:37.625
Well, I did want to go on
a hike today, so I'll risk it.

23:38.459 --> 23:39.710
You're gonna love this one.

23:42.672 --> 23:43.923
Come on.

23:52.515 --> 23:54.183
Hey guys, how are you?

23:54.267 --> 23:56.936
...Trying to hold on
to whatever we possibly can

23:57.019 --> 23:59.522
but history alive, here,
we get these people--

23:59.605 --> 24:00.857
Excuse me.

24:01.816 --> 24:03.776
You stole my vision board
on Games Night.

24:03.860 --> 24:05.528
And, I can appreciate
that you may

24:05.611 --> 24:07.613
be experiencing feelings
about my reno

24:07.697 --> 24:10.408
but forcing a woman with
seasonal affective disorder

24:10.491 --> 24:12.201
to run is just cruel.

24:12.285 --> 24:14.162
Jayne dropped out.

24:14.245 --> 24:16.080
Oh, well, who's running?

24:16.164 --> 24:17.665
- Oh.

24:19.375 --> 24:22.587
Let's run a clean campaign
and leave the kids out of this.

24:22.670 --> 24:24.213
They didn't choose this life.

24:24.297 --> 24:25.923
- We did.
- Mm...

24:30.094 --> 24:32.054
He used to rub your
bathing suit with poison ivy.

24:32.138 --> 24:34.640
- Remember that.
- I...

24:34.724 --> 24:37.101
Had forgotten.

24:40.396 --> 24:41.856
- Yes.
- Oh, hi.

24:41.939 --> 24:45.484
Justin Lovejoy,
simple cottage renter.

24:45.568 --> 24:48.446
Uh, when faced with
new construction

24:48.529 --> 24:50.364
and renovation on the lake,

24:50.448 --> 24:54.702
how do you plan to ensure
lake heritage is preserved?

24:54.785 --> 24:57.663
I will start
a committee to make sure

24:57.747 --> 25:00.208
that development
and renovations

25:00.291 --> 25:02.376
on the lake are controlled.

25:02.460 --> 25:05.296
- Woo! Good point, babe,

25:05.379 --> 25:07.048
That's-- That's what you want.

25:07.131 --> 25:08.841
That's the thing you want.

25:08.925 --> 25:12.136
I would argue that development
is a good thing.

25:12.220 --> 25:14.972
It ups property value
which benefits us all.

25:15.056 --> 25:16.307
- Boo!

25:16.390 --> 25:17.642
So true.

25:17.725 --> 25:19.560
What if we get priced out?

25:19.644 --> 25:23.231
Of course, I mean, modest
renovations and general upkeep.

25:23.314 --> 25:25.858
People need to stop painting
deckchairs scarlet.

25:25.942 --> 25:27.193
It's triggering.

25:27.276 --> 25:28.527
So, is adultery.

25:29.737 --> 25:32.323
If elected,
I will stop Maisy's embargo

25:32.406 --> 25:35.243
on party pontoons
and tubing hours.

25:35.326 --> 25:36.577
Wayne Moore guarantee!

25:39.372 --> 25:42.124
The Boathouse's decision
to limit certain watercraft

25:42.208 --> 25:45.002
is very much on par
with other lakes in the area.

25:46.462 --> 25:47.964
Which we all appreciate.

25:48.047 --> 25:49.590
Skin this flawless
requires eight hours

25:49.674 --> 25:51.550
of uninterrupted sleep.

25:52.134 --> 25:54.470
What are you gonna do
about the wild boars?

25:56.180 --> 25:57.598
A pack was spotted
at Newmarket.

25:59.016 --> 26:00.476
Boars.

26:00.559 --> 26:01.894
- For real?
- Yeah.

26:01.978 --> 26:03.479
They ate a poodle.

26:03.562 --> 26:06.065
Newmarket is, what,
600 kilometres away?

26:06.148 --> 26:07.566
Can boars drive?

26:07.650 --> 26:10.111
Ignoring the threat
won't stop them.

26:10.194 --> 26:11.696
Unless it will.

26:21.956 --> 26:24.292
There are many ways to deal
with invasive species

26:24.375 --> 26:26.335
but yelling isn't one of them!

26:26.419 --> 26:28.004
Why don't we take 10 minutes

26:28.087 --> 26:30.006
and then we can share
our closing statements

26:30.089 --> 26:31.549
and then vote?

26:31.632 --> 26:32.925
- Ulrika?
- Mm-hm.

26:33.009 --> 26:34.427
Can I talk to you for a second?

26:34.510 --> 26:35.761
Mm.

26:36.679 --> 26:39.265
Mm-hm. Yeah.

26:48.149 --> 26:50.067
Oh, my God.

26:51.861 --> 26:53.195
- Oh.
- This is one of

26:53.279 --> 26:54.613
my favourite places
on the lake.

26:54.697 --> 26:56.449
Oh, cool.
We should get a pic, then.

26:56.532 --> 26:57.783
Yeah.

26:58.826 --> 27:00.453
Here, I'll do it.

27:00.536 --> 27:01.996
I got the reach.

27:05.249 --> 27:07.877
Get the water.

27:07.960 --> 27:09.420
Cool.

27:09.503 --> 27:11.005
- Here you go.
- And you're cool if I--

27:11.088 --> 27:12.548
I post this pic?

27:12.631 --> 27:13.966
Yeah, it's a good one.

27:14.050 --> 27:15.551
- And you're cool

27:15.634 --> 27:16.969
with me tagging you, right?
Like, so...

27:17.053 --> 27:18.471
- all our friends can see?
- Yeah.

27:19.430 --> 27:21.557
All right. Uh, I'm doing it.

27:21.640 --> 27:22.892
Now.

27:24.810 --> 27:26.645
Ready to jump?

27:26.729 --> 27:28.105
Come again?

27:28.189 --> 27:29.607
The best way
to get into the water

27:29.690 --> 27:30.983
is to jump off Raven's Rock.

27:36.822 --> 27:38.074
Ah.

27:39.200 --> 27:40.618
You know that if Wayne wins,

27:40.701 --> 27:42.203
the lake goes full frat house,

27:42.286 --> 27:43.913
or was that your fantasy
all along?

27:43.996 --> 27:45.414
Not since I was 12.

27:45.498 --> 27:46.749
And you should have
thought of that

27:46.832 --> 27:48.167
before you scared Jayne away.

27:48.250 --> 27:49.668
There's a reason
that Jayne is my VP.

27:49.752 --> 27:51.337
She cannot handle
the power plays.

27:51.420 --> 27:53.255
Oh, bullshit.

27:53.339 --> 27:54.882
Jayne taught you
everything that you know.

27:54.965 --> 27:57.134
Her yearbook wanking play
was iconic bullying.

27:57.218 --> 27:59.512
Oh. Sweetie, that was me.

27:59.595 --> 28:01.222
I just let Jayne take the fall.

28:01.305 --> 28:02.932
Anyway, I did it for you.
Your dad thought

28:03.015 --> 28:05.601
you were straight for,
like, two more years.

28:05.684 --> 28:08.562
You may have stolen his love
and my childhood bedroom

28:08.646 --> 28:11.273
but I am not some
fat kid locked in your trunk

28:11.357 --> 28:13.234
at a Smash Mouth concert
anymore.

28:13.317 --> 28:16.153
I will not let you destroy
my family legacy.

28:20.533 --> 28:22.618
My trunk is sealed now.

28:22.701 --> 28:24.537
Airtight.

28:25.413 --> 28:26.872
Uh...

28:26.956 --> 28:28.958
You know, I'm good.

28:29.041 --> 28:32.503
I'm, like, totally fine with
just staying up here, forever.

28:32.586 --> 28:34.422
Okay, well, the jump's
scarier than the water.

28:34.505 --> 28:35.965
Yeah, that's not helping.

28:38.467 --> 28:39.718
Here.

28:41.470 --> 28:44.348
Ah-ha! Honeydicked you!

28:44.432 --> 28:45.975
Honey-what?

28:46.058 --> 28:47.643
It's where you set up
a trap using your...

28:47.726 --> 28:50.729
lady... dick... wiles.

28:50.813 --> 28:53.607
I'm-- I'm just trying to help
you get in the water.

28:53.691 --> 28:55.192
Yeah, he helps me tilt.

28:55.276 --> 28:57.486
You make s'mores.
You take me hiking.

28:58.362 --> 29:00.322
How's Sara going to
feel about this?

29:02.616 --> 29:06.162
Uh, Sara, honestly,
she wouldn't care.

29:06.245 --> 29:08.289
If I were your girlfriend,
I'd care a shit ton.

29:11.542 --> 29:12.960
Sara's into girls.

29:14.086 --> 29:15.796
Our parents are best friends

29:15.880 --> 29:18.048
and they've been stanning us
since we were in diapers.

29:18.757 --> 29:21.010
But, Sara came out
to me this year

29:21.093 --> 29:23.345
and I agreed to keep saying
we were a thing until

29:23.429 --> 29:24.889
she came out to her parents.

29:26.515 --> 29:29.059
So, you're just this,
like, really cool,

29:29.143 --> 29:31.395
really decent guy
who wants to help me?

29:31.479 --> 29:33.355
You think I'm cool?

29:35.024 --> 29:36.358
Hold this.

29:43.699 --> 29:45.951
Maiser! He's doing it.
Killian's finally facing

29:46.035 --> 29:47.870
his fears and jumping off
Raven's Rock with Billie!

29:47.953 --> 29:49.705
What? They're jumping off
of Raven's Rock?

29:49.788 --> 29:51.373
I was just gonna
take her there to swim.

29:51.457 --> 29:52.958
Only the Patterson girl
broke her leg there

29:53.042 --> 29:54.627
when she was jumping off
and the water levels

29:54.710 --> 29:56.086
went down.
She almost drowned.

29:56.170 --> 29:57.421
That was because
she was swimming back

29:57.505 --> 29:59.215
with a broken leg. Come on.

29:59.298 --> 30:01.383
Shit.
She's not answering her phone.

30:01.467 --> 30:03.052
You guys go.
I'll stay with Opal.

30:03.135 --> 30:05.679
And don't worry about Wayne.
He's a big boy.

30:05.763 --> 30:08.474
He can manage without
his campaign manager.

30:09.308 --> 30:11.644
- Now, where'd I dock my boat.
- Ugh...

30:11.727 --> 30:13.854
Well, I can take you
to the Rock on my boat.

30:13.938 --> 30:15.564
- Sweet.
- Please tell me that

30:15.648 --> 30:17.149
you're hiding a Victorian
doll collection at home

30:17.233 --> 30:18.609
because I'm very
sexually conflicted

30:18.692 --> 30:20.778
by your big
masc for masc energy.

30:20.861 --> 30:22.488
- Yes.
- Okay.

30:32.706 --> 30:34.750
- Shit!

30:34.833 --> 30:36.585
Billie! Billie!

30:36.669 --> 30:38.212
Billie! Oh, shit.

30:41.257 --> 30:43.425
What the fuck? Are you okay?

30:43.509 --> 30:46.303
I'm fine.
This is my third jump.

30:46.387 --> 30:49.473
You conquered
your fear of lake water.

30:49.557 --> 30:51.725
Ya did it because of me!

30:51.809 --> 30:53.060
Nope.

30:53.143 --> 30:54.520
Because of him.

30:54.603 --> 30:56.438
Woo!

30:56.522 --> 30:58.357
Yes! That's my boy!

31:00.234 --> 31:01.485
Woo!

31:02.403 --> 31:03.904
- You good?
- No.

31:05.489 --> 31:06.949
Just a little longer.

31:07.032 --> 31:08.617
Nice jump.

31:16.667 --> 31:19.169
Oh, my God,
what happened? Who won?

31:19.253 --> 31:20.963
The candidate for the job.

31:21.046 --> 31:23.882
Wayne! Hey, congratulations.

31:23.966 --> 31:25.217
How does it feel
to be President?

31:25.301 --> 31:27.219
You'll have to ask Ulrika.

31:27.303 --> 31:29.054
Yeah. I mean, she had
the better wild boar policy.

31:29.138 --> 31:31.473
I think.
I checked out for a bit.

31:31.557 --> 31:34.393
Hm. I'm gonna grab pop.

31:34.476 --> 31:36.604
Well,
as my grandma used to say,

31:36.687 --> 31:38.314
- "There's always--"
- Maiser.

31:38.397 --> 31:40.190
Ulrika is president?

31:40.274 --> 31:43.068
I asked her to take my place.
I was losing the crowd.

31:43.152 --> 31:44.862
- I had to pivot.
- But what if

31:44.945 --> 31:47.156
she veto's our renos
like you vetoed Jayne's dock?

31:47.239 --> 31:48.824
Oh man, is--

31:48.907 --> 31:50.326
Is this what failure
feels like?

31:50.409 --> 31:51.785
Did Brené lie?

31:51.869 --> 31:53.120
No, relax.

31:53.203 --> 31:54.872
Trust me, I got this.

31:54.955 --> 31:57.166
- Ooh.
- Uh, thank you.

31:57.249 --> 31:59.293
I promise
to protect the environment

31:59.376 --> 32:01.837
and keep
the lake safe from boars.

32:01.920 --> 32:03.589
The only wild pigs welcome here

32:03.672 --> 32:06.175
will be on our spits
and in our bellies!

32:08.469 --> 32:11.221
- You're welcome.
- Yeah.

32:11.305 --> 32:13.140
Thank you. Yes. Mm-hm.

32:13.223 --> 32:15.976
All right. Not a bad day.

32:16.060 --> 32:18.771
Ulrika will put Maisy's
demo on slo-mo

32:18.854 --> 32:21.565
and Killian's girlfriend
is into girls.

32:21.649 --> 32:24.276
And, I only had to completely
humiliate myself to find out!

32:24.360 --> 32:27.488
Oh yes, but no more fear
of what lies beneath.

32:27.571 --> 32:29.823
- She's a lake baby, now.
- You only had

32:29.907 --> 32:31.533
to stand me up
twice for it to happen.

32:33.869 --> 32:36.413
Did you just break
into our cabin?

32:37.164 --> 32:39.500
No... The door was open.

32:39.583 --> 32:42.086
I thought I'd just pop by
and grab my battleship.

32:42.169 --> 32:43.837
I really hope it's all here.

32:43.921 --> 32:45.881
It's so frustrating
playing with missing pieces.

32:45.964 --> 32:49.218
Yeah. Gotta watch out
for that submarine.

32:49.301 --> 32:51.053
Sneak attack under the water.

32:51.136 --> 32:53.180
I prefer the aircraft carrier.

32:53.263 --> 32:55.099
I like big guns.

32:57.101 --> 32:59.687
Oh, she is sweating.

32:59.770 --> 33:01.397
If Ulrika delays
her reno long enough,

33:01.480 --> 33:03.232
she's gonna lose
all of her deposits.

33:03.315 --> 33:05.442
She could be off the lake
a lot sooner than we'd hoped.

33:06.068 --> 33:08.487
Which means
Killian's gone, too.

33:08.570 --> 33:10.114
Well then,
you better make a move fast

33:10.197 --> 33:12.741
'cause summer romance
ain't meant to last.

33:18.455 --> 33:21.083
- Look at what mommy found...
- My vision board.

33:21.166 --> 33:22.876
- Finally.
- You might want

33:22.960 --> 33:25.337
to check it's all there.
Justin really loves swatches.

33:25.421 --> 33:27.339
Oh, Barry at the warehouse

33:27.423 --> 33:29.133
says they're discontinuing
Walnut Brûlée.

33:29.216 --> 33:30.759
Well, call him
and tell him we'll take

33:30.843 --> 33:32.511
- everything that's left.
- Maybe we should wait.

33:32.594 --> 33:33.929
I mean, what if Ulrika

33:34.012 --> 33:35.597
doesn't let us build
our new cottage?

33:35.681 --> 33:38.058
No. No, sweetie.

33:39.309 --> 33:41.937
Mommy's gonna brûlée
this baby to the ground.

33:42.020 --> 33:44.940
