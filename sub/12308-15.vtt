00:05.219 --> 00:07.365
<i>And to another fine year of trading.</i>

00:07.485 --> 00:08.492
<i>Hear, hear!</i>

00:08.612 --> 00:10.532
Truly, the medical supplies
you have given to us

00:10.652 --> 00:14.080
over the past several years have made an
immeasurable difference to our people.

00:14.200 --> 00:16.937
Not to mention your warning last harvest
that the Wraith were nearby.

00:17.894 --> 00:19.365
You saved many lives.

00:19.743 --> 00:21.285
Well, you know.

00:21.594 --> 00:23.472
My favorite missions are
to do our trading.

00:23.592 --> 00:25.853
<i>And I've said that, I can prove it.
I'm not just saying...</i>

00:26.022 --> 00:27.751
You don't need to prove it.

00:27.871 --> 00:29.074
You know, actually,

00:29.234 --> 00:30.950
we got to get going.
So soon?

00:31.112 --> 00:32.838
- Yeah, so soon?
- We were hoping that

00:32.958 --> 00:34.405
you could stay...

00:36.534 --> 00:37.329
Well, I...

00:37.449 --> 00:39.619
I guess we could stay a little longer.

00:39.884 --> 00:41.158
I hate to...

00:42.225 --> 00:43.660
no, never mind.

00:43.832 --> 00:46.511
- What is it?
- Well, I wouldn't dream of imposing...

00:46.631 --> 00:48.802
you've been so generous
to our people already...

00:48.969 --> 00:51.094
- What's the problem?
- Our sister.

00:51.220 --> 00:52.931
She is in great need of your help.

00:53.091 --> 00:55.558
- I didn't even know you had a sister.
- We do indeed.

00:55.718 --> 00:58.037
And I imagine
she's as beautiful as you two.

00:58.222 --> 00:59.248
Even more so.

01:01.140 --> 01:03.917
- And she's in great need of guidance.
- Guidance. That I can do.

01:04.769 --> 01:06.152
You are most generous.

01:06.345 --> 01:08.100
Excuse us for one moment.

01:08.220 --> 01:09.374
I'll get her.

01:13.732 --> 01:14.994
- Dibs.
- What?

01:15.154 --> 01:17.664
- I'm calling dibs on the third sister.
- You can't call dibs.

01:17.927 --> 01:20.413
Look, we both know that Flora
and Mardola have been suckered in

01:20.533 --> 01:22.898
by the whole cliche-heroic thing
you've got going,

01:23.018 --> 01:26.226
but maybe this other sister, maybe
her taste in men will run more to the...

01:26.346 --> 01:27.169
Geeky?

01:27.781 --> 01:30.385
I was going to say "cerebral,"
but who knows. Maybe we'll hit it off.

01:30.546 --> 01:32.929
I don't need your love life
screwing up our trade relations.

01:33.089 --> 01:35.181
I'll try not to break her heart,
but no promises.

01:39.970 --> 01:41.973
These are the men
I was telling you about.

01:42.093 --> 01:43.093
Gentlemen,

01:43.226 --> 01:44.725
this is our sister...

01:44.845 --> 01:45.845
Harmony.

01:49.719 --> 01:50.542
Super.

<i>As you know, our mother and</i>

03:04.223 --> 03:06.924
queen passed at the beginning
of this lunar cycle.

03:07.044 --> 03:09.108
A secret, sacred ceremony was held

03:09.228 --> 03:12.285
to determine which of her three
daughters would succeed her.

03:12.735 --> 03:15.615
It was determined that Harmony
shall be the new queen.

03:15.735 --> 03:16.545
Really?

03:16.734 --> 03:17.770
Well, congrats.

03:17.890 --> 03:19.159
<i>Before she is crowned,</i>

03:19.321 --> 03:22.580
all future queens must perform
a time-honored rite of passage.

03:22.741 --> 03:24.915
A rite of passage
normally performed alone.

03:25.108 --> 03:27.332
It is not written one way or another.

03:28.985 --> 03:30.552
And Harmony is so young.

03:30.672 --> 03:32.799
- It concerns me greatly.
- I can do it.

03:33.546 --> 03:34.800
You are very brave...

03:34.920 --> 03:36.426
but the trail is difficult.

03:36.546 --> 03:38.186
It would bring me great comfort to know

03:38.306 --> 03:40.750
that you had someone
looking out for you.

03:41.982 --> 03:44.798
What kind of rite of passage
are we talking about here?

03:44.919 --> 03:48.555
Deep in the forest lies the ruins
of the great temple of Laros.

03:49.787 --> 03:53.695
Every queen must take a pilgrimage
before the end of the first lunar cycle

03:53.855 --> 03:55.321
<i>of their selection.</i>

03:55.481 --> 03:59.301
Once there, she must meditate
on the journey that lies ahead of her

03:59.421 --> 04:01.732
and pray to be endowed
with the knowledge and power

04:01.852 --> 04:03.121
to govern her people.

04:03.421 --> 04:05.331
How deep in the forest?

04:05.491 --> 04:07.115
No more than a day's trek.

04:07.285 --> 04:07.990
I see.

04:08.110 --> 04:08.987
Yes. No.

04:09.107 --> 04:10.424
We are very honored,

04:10.544 --> 04:13.545
but why don't you just have
a couple of your own guards escort her?

04:13.670 --> 04:16.608
Although it is not written so,
our people will expect their new queen

04:16.728 --> 04:18.928
to have completed the journey
on her own.

04:19.983 --> 04:23.224
So you don't want her to be alone,
but you don't want anyone to know

04:23.601 --> 04:25.365
<i>- she's getting help.</i>
- Precisely.

04:25.553 --> 04:27.812
Right. We'd love to lend a hand, but...

04:29.515 --> 04:32.521
Our peoples have enjoyed
such a fruitful alliance.

04:33.282 --> 04:33.987
Yeah...

04:34.187 --> 04:36.738
One that has greatly benefited
both parties.

04:37.566 --> 04:38.323
Right...

04:38.483 --> 04:40.782
I'd hate to think that one of us
would put that in jeopardy

04:40.944 --> 04:43.284
over a simple day's walk in the forest.

04:49.031 --> 04:50.042
When do we leave?

04:57.742 --> 05:00.812
<i>I must confess...
I'm quite looking forward to this.</i>

05:00.932 --> 05:03.499
<i>I rarely get to leave
the confines of the castle,</i>

05:03.619 --> 05:06.545
<i>although I've had much training
in forest survival.</i>

05:07.144 --> 05:08.437
Oh, you have, have you?

05:08.557 --> 05:09.557
Oh, yes.

05:09.682 --> 05:12.688
I have completed three sessions
with Nolar Lumsbred.

05:12.808 --> 05:15.687
He is one of the greatest hunters
amongst my people.

05:15.807 --> 05:17.097
Three whole sessions?

05:17.217 --> 05:18.997
With the Nolar Lumsbred?

05:19.870 --> 05:21.415
They were all I needed.

05:21.743 --> 05:23.007
I am a quick learner.

05:23.127 --> 05:24.559
I'll bet you are.

05:25.243 --> 05:26.243
Tell me,

05:26.494 --> 05:29.005
which one of you
is the superior officer?

05:29.125 --> 05:30.458
You mean who outranks who?

05:31.376 --> 05:32.085
Yes.

05:32.493 --> 05:34.947
I'm a civilian, I don't have a rank,
but basically, we're equals.

05:35.067 --> 05:36.870
Technically, I'm in charge.

05:37.619 --> 05:38.742
I thought so.

05:39.241 --> 05:42.250
You have all the makings
of an excellent leader, John.

05:42.889 --> 05:44.119
Well, thank you.

05:50.127 --> 05:52.248
- You going to eat your powerbar?
- Yes, Rodney.

05:52.436 --> 05:55.066
I told you, you shouldn't have
eaten yours so early in the day.

05:55.186 --> 05:56.439
I'm starving.

05:56.559 --> 05:59.317
Usually Flora feeds us some sort
of food when we visit.

05:59.437 --> 06:01.613
- Come on, you hardly ever eat yours.
- No, Rodney.

06:01.775 --> 06:04.816
Well, will you give it to me later
when you decide not to eat it?

06:04.936 --> 06:07.703
You allow him
to question you so incessantly?

06:08.436 --> 06:10.252
I guess I'm just used to it by now.

06:10.372 --> 06:12.316
Would it not be easier to beat him?

06:12.535 --> 06:15.003
We don't beat people where we come from.

06:15.123 --> 06:16.123
Why not?

06:16.243 --> 06:19.128
Well, we find it's not very effective
in the long run...

06:19.248 --> 06:20.434
unfortunately.

06:21.685 --> 06:22.556
Really?

06:24.059 --> 06:26.205
<i>You are a truly gentle leader, John.</i>

06:26.748 --> 06:27.748
I admire that.

06:27.874 --> 06:29.389
Thank you, Harmony.

06:33.202 --> 06:35.064
There's supposed to be
a rope bridge here.

06:35.184 --> 06:38.956
- Maybe you're reading the map wrong.
- No, I think it's straight forward.

06:40.435 --> 06:41.691
How old is this map?

06:41.811 --> 06:45.158
It has been passed down from
too many generations to know for sure.

06:46.374 --> 06:48.659
Okay, guess that bridge doesn't exist.

06:51.437 --> 06:52.540
<i>You two stay put.</i>

06:53.048 --> 06:55.543
I'm going to try to find
a safe way across the river.

06:55.703 --> 06:57.679
Don't worry, I'll be right back.

07:17.649 --> 07:19.041
Where'd you find that?

07:19.161 --> 07:20.199
John's bag.

07:21.146 --> 07:22.292
It's not yours.

07:22.449 --> 07:24.568
- I'm hungry.
- You can't just take it like that.

07:24.963 --> 07:27.122
- When I'm hungry, I eat.
- What's gonna happen

07:27.242 --> 07:30.281
- when Sheppard finds out?
- Well, he's not going to know, is he?

07:30.446 --> 07:31.913
He is, I'm gonna tell him.

07:32.073 --> 07:34.925
- I wouldn't do that if I were you.
- Yeah, or what?

07:35.547 --> 07:38.485
- I'm the queen.
- Not yet, you're not, little sister.

07:39.372 --> 07:42.057
Trust me, you don't
want to be on my bad side.

07:42.450 --> 07:45.259
Right? And what are you going to do?
Have me beaten?

07:46.916 --> 07:50.016
All right, princess, just hand it over.

07:52.414 --> 07:55.100
See, now, you're in trouble. You just
wait till Sheppard gets back here...

07:55.220 --> 07:58.257
- He's gonna...
- I think I found a place for us to...

07:59.405 --> 08:00.691
Is that my powerbar?

08:00.851 --> 08:02.697
- She stole it.
- I did not!

08:02.926 --> 08:04.646
What? You so did! Tell him!

08:04.766 --> 08:06.134
I would never do such a thing!

08:06.256 --> 08:08.603
The second you were gone,
she went into your bag.

08:08.723 --> 08:10.128
You are a liar!

08:10.248 --> 08:13.204
- You are a lying liar!
- Please, who are you going to believe?

08:14.192 --> 08:18.000
Well, if she stole it, Rodney,
how come you've got the wrapper?

08:18.997 --> 08:21.169
Well, b... I was trying to take it
back from her,

08:21.294 --> 08:23.840
and then she wolfs it down
and hands me the wrapper.

08:24.159 --> 08:25.091
Really?

08:25.251 --> 08:27.259
Okay, you better come clean, brat.

08:36.356 --> 08:37.724
It's okay, sweetie.

08:38.126 --> 08:40.164
Sometimes... he makes me cry, too.

08:46.116 --> 08:49.580
All right, we need to get going here.
All right? I found a path.

08:49.700 --> 08:51.912
Can I navigate from the map?

08:52.032 --> 08:53.828
Sure,
as soon as we get back on the path.

09:13.966 --> 09:14.882
Now...

09:15.488 --> 09:16.496
we go...

09:16.616 --> 09:17.434
Right.

09:17.953 --> 09:18.926
Correct.

09:24.660 --> 09:27.278
- What was that?
- That's probably the beast.

09:27.438 --> 09:28.613
Sorry, the what now?

09:28.773 --> 09:29.947
The beast.

09:30.107 --> 09:32.033
<i>The protector of the ruins of Laros.</i>

09:33.018 --> 09:36.120
- Did Flora not tell you of it?
- I guess she forgot to mention it.

09:36.999 --> 09:37.908
Don't worry.

09:38.028 --> 09:41.742
When you say "beast," I'm assuming
that's a figure of speech, right?

09:42.578 --> 09:44.003
No, it's a beast, all right...

09:44.425 --> 09:46.881
though no one is quite certain
what it looks like.

09:47.042 --> 09:50.092
Those who have cast their eyes upon it
have quickly perished.

09:50.526 --> 09:52.595
But your little knife will protect us.

09:53.175 --> 09:54.412
I'm the queen.

09:54.532 --> 09:55.696
It will not harm me.

09:55.823 --> 09:58.466
We may not get a chance
to tell the beast that.

09:58.940 --> 10:00.217
It will know.

10:00.978 --> 10:01.888
<i>Listen,</i>

10:02.891 --> 10:04.921
why don't we say
we made it as far as the ruins?

10:05.042 --> 10:08.237
We don't actually have to make it there.
They never have to know the difference.

10:08.357 --> 10:09.546
I would know.

10:09.666 --> 10:12.136
Yeah, but you're going to be queen,
so who cares, right?

10:12.256 --> 10:13.209
I care.

10:13.603 --> 10:14.700
My people care.

10:15.861 --> 10:16.693
Listen...

10:16.879 --> 10:20.483
Perhaps it would be best if you stopped
speaking. Your voice hurts my ears.

10:20.603 --> 10:23.444
Well, that beast could hurt
my whole body, okay?

10:23.564 --> 10:28.214
So I'm sorry, but this is not what we
signed up for. Back me up here.

10:30.430 --> 10:31.252
John?

10:33.635 --> 10:37.124
According to legend,
the beast attacks silently.

10:37.969 --> 10:40.273
I thought you said the beast
would know you were the queen.

10:40.393 --> 10:42.395
Well, it didn't attack me.

10:43.026 --> 10:43.793
John?

10:44.552 --> 10:45.565
Are you there?

10:46.130 --> 10:47.850
It is strange, though...

10:48.926 --> 10:51.821
the beast is supposed to only attack
enemies of the throne.

10:52.979 --> 10:55.760
If it was going to kill anyone,
it should have killed you.

10:55.880 --> 10:59.012
I'm not an enemy to the throne.
I'm not! I'm here to protect you.

10:59.132 --> 11:00.706
<i>Don't move!</i>

11:04.445 --> 11:06.437
So far, I'm not impressed.

11:12.376 --> 11:13.671
Drop your weapon.

11:20.079 --> 11:21.017
We have her.

11:21.726 --> 11:23.728
Map grid 11 in the small clearing.

11:23.888 --> 11:24.938
<i>On our way.</i>

11:27.339 --> 11:28.943
- Hand her over.
- You're Genii.

11:29.314 --> 11:31.694
Step aside, and hand her over.

11:31.854 --> 11:34.676
This is obviously some sort
of huge misunderstanding. All right?

11:34.797 --> 11:38.159
I'm Dr. Rodney McKay. I'm a close
personal friend of Ladon Radim.

11:39.781 --> 11:41.406
You know, your leader?

11:42.729 --> 11:45.791
<i>I'm your greatest ally!
You don't know who I am?</i>

11:45.951 --> 11:49.711
I'm the genius scientist. The friend of
John Sheppard?I gave you the bomb?

11:49.979 --> 11:51.624
No? Nothing?

11:51.916 --> 11:54.592
- What do they teach in Genii school?
- Hand her over. Right now.

11:54.752 --> 11:57.497
- Okay, let's just talk about this.
- I'm growing impatient.

11:58.798 --> 12:00.563
Our quarrel is not with you.

12:01.212 --> 12:03.768
Once you hand her over,
you're free to go.

12:04.169 --> 12:05.811
- Really?
- Yes.

12:09.783 --> 12:10.965
You wouldn't.

12:12.036 --> 12:14.153
You took a sacred oath to protect me.

12:14.931 --> 12:17.406
- Nah, I don't remember doing that.
<i>- I'm going to count to three.</i>

12:21.507 --> 12:22.347
One...

12:27.910 --> 12:30.240
- Where have you been?
- Well, my spidey senses

12:30.360 --> 12:31.754
felt an ambush coming on.

12:32.286 --> 12:33.630
And you couldn't mention it?

12:33.791 --> 12:36.634
- Not without tipping them off, no.
- What took you so long?

12:36.965 --> 12:39.940
I had to take a position so
I could shoot all three at once.

12:40.524 --> 12:41.668
You okay?

12:42.113 --> 12:42.818
No.

12:43.547 --> 12:45.643
No, I most certainly am not.

12:46.317 --> 12:48.559
This one was going to
hand me over to those men.

12:48.679 --> 12:50.834
- No, I wasn't.
- I saw it in your eyes.

12:50.954 --> 12:52.426
You were considering it.

12:52.546 --> 12:55.276
To save your own worthless,
cowardly hide.

12:55.437 --> 12:58.197
I was keeping them talking, you know,
I was buying us time.

12:58.357 --> 13:01.575
A little thing called "strategy"? You're
too young to know anything about it.

13:01.735 --> 13:03.433
Oh, I understand strategy.

13:03.944 --> 13:06.144
In fact, I'm forming one right now...

13:06.264 --> 13:08.666
the second we return to the castle,
I will instruct

13:08.827 --> 13:10.292
- my guards to...
- All right.

13:10.452 --> 13:13.629
Plenty of time to come up
with punishments along the way.

13:15.793 --> 13:18.607
- But, John...
- Thumb screws, you like them?

13:19.541 --> 13:20.268
Yes.

13:21.037 --> 13:22.620
Thumb screws are good.

13:23.405 --> 13:27.561
We better find some cover. That back-up
he called is gonna be here any minute.

13:35.102 --> 13:36.724
All right, this'll work.

13:39.054 --> 13:40.059
Those were Genii.

13:40.180 --> 13:42.008
Yeah, I picked up on that,
Rodney. Thanks.

13:42.157 --> 13:42.953
So...

13:43.485 --> 13:45.320
what are the Genii doing here?

13:45.807 --> 13:47.928
And why do they want to kill her?

13:48.048 --> 13:49.749
I mean, aside from the obvious reasons.

13:50.496 --> 13:51.401
Harmony?

13:52.295 --> 13:53.535
I don't know.

13:54.059 --> 13:55.379
I don't like the Genii.

13:55.959 --> 13:57.256
But you know who they are.

13:57.416 --> 13:59.592
<i>- Are you trading partners?</i>
- Not anymore.

14:00.216 --> 14:01.968
- But you were.
- <i>Yes.</i>

14:02.129 --> 14:04.812
But they cheated my mother
on many trades.

14:05.167 --> 14:06.849
She banished them from our land.

14:07.751 --> 14:09.049
What about you?

14:09.336 --> 14:11.512
When you're queen,
are you gonna start trade back up?

14:11.632 --> 14:13.439
No! Absolutely not.

14:13.599 --> 14:16.451
So maybe somebody in the royal court's
a little more willing to play ball.

14:16.571 --> 14:18.908
You know, once the path is cleared.

14:19.550 --> 14:22.475
If I were to die,
my sister would succeed me.

14:23.032 --> 14:25.950
But if the Genii think that she would be
more willing to trade than me,

14:26.175 --> 14:27.911
they are sadly mistaken.

14:28.031 --> 14:31.036
You really believe Ladon would give the
marching orders to kill a little girl...

14:31.156 --> 14:32.249
even this one?

14:32.409 --> 14:34.319
I don't know how these people work.

14:34.439 --> 14:37.630
Maybe he told someone to fix that,
and this is what they came up with.

14:37.961 --> 14:39.048
It's creative.

14:39.533 --> 14:42.290
Knowing why they're here
really doesn't help us out.

14:42.962 --> 14:45.971
I need to get a take on how many
are out there. You stay with her, okay?

14:47.031 --> 14:47.890
Sure.

14:48.196 --> 14:50.258
All right, stay here, and stay quiet.

14:50.378 --> 14:51.393
<i>Of course, John.</i>

14:51.744 --> 14:53.904
Thank you for taking care of this.

14:54.176 --> 14:56.565
I'm not sure what I would do
if you weren't here.

15:07.789 --> 15:09.785
Tell me something, Doctor.

15:10.701 --> 15:13.374
The place where you sleep at night,
is it guarded?

15:13.924 --> 15:16.063
I know what you're trying to do,
it's not going to work.

15:16.183 --> 15:18.509
I'm not scared of you.
You're just a kid. A bratty little kid.

15:18.629 --> 15:21.688
I don't care you're gonna be queen.
Nothing could impress me less, so

15:21.808 --> 15:25.227
why don't just cool it with bad seed act
and just go back to ignoring me?

15:26.608 --> 15:28.847
Surely they can't guard you
all the time?

15:38.226 --> 15:40.720
<i>Squad three,
take up position on the ridge.</i>

15:41.042 --> 15:43.215
<i>Squad four, move to map grid nine.</i>

15:45.429 --> 15:46.654
<i>Acknowledged.</i>

15:47.547 --> 15:48.968
Wonderful.

15:51.614 --> 15:53.598
Stop it. What are you doing?

15:54.307 --> 15:56.621
I'm burning your face into my memory.

15:56.963 --> 15:58.907
- You...
- This way I can give the bounty hunters

15:59.027 --> 16:01.310
an extremely accurate
description of you.

16:01.430 --> 16:04.481
All right, Your Highness,
I have had just about enough out of...

16:04.601 --> 16:07.600
I thought I said
keep talking to the minimum?

16:07.720 --> 16:09.204
I was... she was...

16:10.509 --> 16:12.498
How many Genii are out there, John?

16:12.757 --> 16:15.151
If I had to guess, I'd say all of them.

16:15.271 --> 16:16.939
What, so, a lot of them?

16:17.171 --> 16:18.397
Yes, Rodney. A lot.

16:18.557 --> 16:20.941
This will make the pilgrimage
most difficult.

16:21.101 --> 16:23.027
That's funny,
I was thinking the same thing.

16:25.097 --> 16:27.803
I find we have much in common, John.

16:30.551 --> 16:31.357
Yeah.

16:32.916 --> 16:35.914
Anyway, I figure we wait for nightfall
and then head back to the settlement.

16:36.983 --> 16:38.250
Back to the settlement?

16:38.410 --> 16:39.960
Yep, road trip's over.

16:40.120 --> 16:42.046
But that would make
this journey a failure.

16:42.206 --> 16:45.257
You win some, you lose some. You wanna
be queen, learn how to cut your losses.

16:45.582 --> 16:47.867
But the lunar cycle is nearing its end.

16:48.202 --> 16:50.815
If I do not make it to the ruins
by tomorrow's sundown,

16:50.935 --> 16:52.181
I will forfeit the throne.

16:52.341 --> 16:53.945
I'm sure they'll make an exception.

16:54.065 --> 16:55.976
No, they cannot. It is our way.

16:57.099 --> 16:59.622
It's too dangerous to move forward.

17:00.865 --> 17:02.287
For you, perhaps.

17:04.336 --> 17:08.030
If it's too dangerous for me,
it's definitely too dangerous for you.

17:08.540 --> 17:11.450
We're gonna wait for nightfall, and then
we're gonna head back to the village.

17:11.609 --> 17:13.952
- End of discussion.
- Fat chance of that.

17:15.002 --> 17:17.539
It's not your decision to make.
I'm the queen.

17:17.699 --> 17:18.775
No. Not yet.

17:19.321 --> 17:22.127
And until you are, you're just
a regular kid. I call the shots.

17:23.344 --> 17:26.256
Many would consider
disobeying the queen a treasonous act.

17:26.415 --> 17:29.927
Well, I'm sure they wouldn't look too
fondly on letting the queen get killed.

17:31.380 --> 17:33.194
We're heading back.

17:45.607 --> 17:47.069
You should not be here.

17:47.189 --> 17:48.378
I was careful.

17:48.831 --> 17:50.697
No one saw me, don't worry.

17:52.781 --> 17:55.282
We use this from now on
to stay in contact.

17:56.854 --> 17:58.621
Does that mean it's not over yet?

17:58.741 --> 17:59.451
No.

18:00.242 --> 18:02.913
Her two guardians have
complicated things greatly.

18:03.033 --> 18:04.336
They killed three of my men.

18:05.427 --> 18:06.261
Yes, well,

18:06.381 --> 18:08.424
they were an unforeseen complication.

18:08.584 --> 18:09.800
My apologies.

18:10.074 --> 18:12.342
Your apologies do me little good.

18:12.601 --> 18:14.012
We will increase your pay,

18:14.172 --> 18:15.352
don't worry.

18:16.360 --> 18:17.474
Threefold.

18:17.757 --> 18:18.934
Threefold?

18:19.094 --> 18:20.811
Triple the work, triple the pay.

18:21.201 --> 18:22.771
You want us to kill them all?

18:23.484 --> 18:25.733
If they survive,
they'll come back and tell my sister

18:25.853 --> 18:27.492
that the Genii were involved.

18:27.612 --> 18:29.528
Now, we can't have that, can we?

18:45.750 --> 18:46.720
Listen...

18:48.234 --> 18:50.612
- I've been doing a little thinking.
- Oh, you have, have you?

18:50.732 --> 18:53.721
I've a Wraith stunner in my backpack.
She can't weigh more than 90 pounds.

18:53.841 --> 18:56.099
I say we stun her
and just carry her back.

18:58.560 --> 19:00.225
Well, we can't stun a 13-year-old girl.

19:01.386 --> 19:02.638
<i>It's kinda dangerous.</i>

19:02.804 --> 19:05.856
The forest is crawling with Genii. Who
knows when she'd throw one of her fits?

19:06.016 --> 19:08.275
She'll be fine.
She understands how dangerous this is.

19:08.435 --> 19:10.688
<i>- I talked to her.</i>
- I'm sure you did, but she's 13,

19:10.808 --> 19:13.637
she's unreasonable,
among many other awful attributes.

19:13.977 --> 19:15.722
They say you dislike
the things in others

19:15.842 --> 19:17.944
that you, in fact,
dislike about yourself.

19:18.064 --> 19:19.201
So, what?

19:19.321 --> 19:20.633
I'm just saying.

19:20.753 --> 19:22.623
- We're nothing alike.
- Okay.

19:23.089 --> 19:25.590
She's a stuck-up, know-it-all brat.

19:29.623 --> 19:32.629
It's about as dark as it's gonna get.
Let's wake her up and get moving.

19:35.178 --> 19:36.094
Oh, no.

19:38.418 --> 19:40.304
Oh, that sneaky little...

19:41.507 --> 19:43.366
I told you we should've stunned her!

19:47.393 --> 19:48.601
I'm gonna kill her.

19:48.814 --> 19:50.900
You really need to
work on your child skills.

19:51.020 --> 19:54.032
We have been searching for her
for over an hour.

19:54.152 --> 19:56.697
We have had not one, but two

19:56.817 --> 19:58.503
close encounters with the Genii.

19:58.623 --> 20:00.951
All so some useless, spoiled brat

20:01.071 --> 20:02.636
can make her meditation appointment?

20:02.823 --> 20:04.960
- More searching, less complaining.
- Sorry, I'm hungry,

20:05.080 --> 20:07.950
- and when I'm hungry, I get cranky.
- And when you get cranky, you get hit.

20:08.070 --> 20:09.262
Okay, okay.

20:09.522 --> 20:11.248
I wish Ronon was here.

20:11.368 --> 20:14.299
You know, you said that out loud, right?
I mean, I'm right here.

20:14.459 --> 20:16.739
Well, it's nothing personal.
It's just he's a better tracker

20:16.859 --> 20:18.632
than both of us combined.

20:19.456 --> 20:20.639
That's true.

20:24.762 --> 20:26.566
Okay, I'm starting to hallucinate.

20:26.686 --> 20:28.864
- Why? What do you see?
- Not see. Smell.

20:28.984 --> 20:31.570
I smell food.
Delicious, fresh-cooked food.

20:31.690 --> 20:34.749
Roast beef, hamburgers,
hot dogs, pork on a spit.

20:34.869 --> 20:35.728
Chicken.

20:35.848 --> 20:38.688
- Yeah, sure, the more, the merrier.
- No, I smell chicken.

20:41.668 --> 20:43.984
The nose that knows. Follow me.

20:48.805 --> 20:49.877
Ah. Found it.

20:50.745 --> 20:52.550
It's coming from down there.

20:53.821 --> 20:56.004
Told you.
You don't need Ronon while I'm here.

20:57.303 --> 20:58.710
What do you think?

20:58.921 --> 21:01.461
- Genii camp?
- Give me your stunner.

21:05.565 --> 21:07.228
All right, stay behind me.

21:18.785 --> 21:19.510
John!

21:20.084 --> 21:21.177
How did you find me?

21:22.110 --> 21:24.064
We could smell your fire a mile away.

21:24.184 --> 21:25.275
<i>That's okay.</i>

21:26.167 --> 21:28.063
I was finished cooking anyway.

21:28.774 --> 21:30.007
You ran away from us.

21:30.127 --> 21:31.751
You didn't give me any choice.

21:34.623 --> 21:36.536
We've been out there searching
for over an hour.

21:36.656 --> 21:38.065
We almost were caught twice.

21:38.185 --> 21:40.743
Yes, it's very dangerous
out there right now.

21:40.998 --> 21:44.375
That's why I decided to seek refuge
in this cave and make camp.

21:46.372 --> 21:47.849
You made all of this?

21:48.313 --> 21:49.025
Yes,

21:49.526 --> 21:50.740
and caught a loden bird.

21:51.061 --> 21:53.352
- <i>They're quite delicious.</i>
- How?

21:55.124 --> 21:57.004
You made all this with that?

21:57.124 --> 22:00.504
I told you, I completed three sessions
with Nolar Lumsbred.

22:00.624 --> 22:03.379
- They covered all that in 3 sessions?
- I am a quick learner.

22:03.499 --> 22:04.528
Do you not listen?

22:09.765 --> 22:10.777
You're mad at me.

22:13.132 --> 22:14.386
Our first fight.

22:16.689 --> 22:18.737
I knew it would happen eventually.

22:20.873 --> 22:22.386
We'll laugh about this one day.

22:22.812 --> 22:25.131
I'm sure we will,
but we got to get moving.

22:25.251 --> 22:27.557
Right after we've eaten the loden bird.

22:29.188 --> 22:30.096
Or not.

22:33.485 --> 22:34.898
That sounded very, very close.

22:36.256 --> 22:38.627
Are we sure this isn't the beast's cave?

22:38.747 --> 22:39.988
You're so ignorant.

22:40.372 --> 22:42.349
<i>The beast doesn't live in caves.</i>

22:42.872 --> 22:44.992
We should stay here
until the coast is clear.

22:45.313 --> 22:46.313
All right.

22:46.689 --> 22:48.020
Half-hour, tops.

22:49.675 --> 22:51.193
Good. I'm hungry.

23:07.837 --> 23:09.751
I brought you the bird's heart.

23:10.836 --> 23:13.995
My people believe
it brings you great luck once consumed.

23:14.462 --> 23:15.828
Thanks, but no thanks.

23:16.281 --> 23:18.734
- You're sure?
- Pretty sure, yeah.

23:19.462 --> 23:20.461
Very well.

23:25.335 --> 23:26.635
Are you still mad at me?

23:27.321 --> 23:28.335
No, I'm over it.

23:29.275 --> 23:30.380
That's good.

23:30.898 --> 23:34.344
- I don't like it when you're mad at me.
- Well, don't give me reason to be mad.

23:35.399 --> 23:36.399
Very well.

23:37.149 --> 23:38.541
So you're 13, huh?

23:39.887 --> 23:41.923
I'll be 14 in five lunar cycles.

23:42.835 --> 23:43.683
Right.

23:44.463 --> 23:45.802
Nervous about being queen?

23:46.151 --> 23:46.877
No.

23:47.588 --> 23:49.910
- Why would I be?
- Well, it's a lot of responsibility.

23:50.775 --> 23:51.895
I know that.

23:52.274 --> 23:56.340
You gotta put the needs of your people
before anything else including your own.

23:57.588 --> 24:00.213
- Some of the time, yes.
- No, pretty much all the time.

24:01.774 --> 24:04.153
I'm sure I will strike a proper balance.

24:04.273 --> 24:07.217
Just remember... you're not queen
because of divine right,

24:07.337 --> 24:09.529
you're queen because
they allow you to be queen.

24:09.649 --> 24:13.791
If you're mean to the people, they may
change their minds. Just remember that.

24:14.649 --> 24:17.015
You know much about leadership, John.

24:17.710 --> 24:19.842
Hard-earned lessons along the way.

24:21.700 --> 24:23.840
And I know much about my people.

24:25.085 --> 24:26.085
I hope so.

24:28.773 --> 24:30.588
I think we would make a good team.

24:32.381 --> 24:33.485
As queen...

24:34.836 --> 24:36.392
I will one day need

24:36.921 --> 24:37.978
a king...

24:40.847 --> 24:42.277
Listen, Harmony...

24:42.397 --> 24:44.310
<i>There's no need to answer now.</i>

24:44.897 --> 24:47.466
I know such an offer
must be overwhelming.

24:48.205 --> 24:50.153
<i>You shouldn't make your decision rashly.</i>

24:50.273 --> 24:53.261
Well, I'm pretty sure I know
which way I'm leaning.

24:53.381 --> 24:56.007
You're a great little lady.
It's just that...

25:03.083 --> 25:06.299
- What the hell was that?
- The Genii just had a little run-in

25:06.419 --> 25:07.885
with the beast.

25:08.171 --> 25:10.965
All right, be a brave girl
and stay here with McKay.

25:11.085 --> 25:13.390
Hey, hey! How come I always
get stuck being the babysitter?

25:13.550 --> 25:15.091
You want to check out the beast?

25:15.211 --> 25:16.278
No, I'm good here.

25:16.398 --> 25:18.272
Thought so. Stay here.

25:29.352 --> 25:30.652
This is Mardola.

25:30.772 --> 25:31.772
I want an update.

25:31.892 --> 25:33.452
What's taking so long?

25:33.834 --> 25:36.955
I have men all along the path
to the ruins. They've gone another way.

25:37.116 --> 25:40.709
Well, obviously. They're not idiots.
You should be looking everywhere but

25:40.870 --> 25:42.112
<i>the path to the ruins.</i>

25:42.524 --> 25:43.902
I am, but it's night,

25:44.022 --> 25:47.265
and this forest is vast and dense.
My men are spread thin.

25:47.840 --> 25:50.023
What if they make it back
to the village?

25:50.586 --> 25:53.221
<i>There's no way that I could save
relations between our two peoples then.</i>

25:54.093 --> 25:56.344
We've just lost contact
with some of my men.

25:56.464 --> 25:58.393
We're heading to
their last-known co-ordinates.

25:59.295 --> 26:01.525
<i>Maybe we'll get lucky. Teran out.</i>

26:10.835 --> 26:12.647
You're a doctor, right?

26:13.056 --> 26:15.404
Yes. Yes. I mean,
I'm not a medical doctor...

26:15.524 --> 26:16.810
So you're a liar?

26:17.523 --> 26:18.713
No, I'm a...

26:20.539 --> 26:21.869
What do you want?

26:23.271 --> 26:25.647
- What does love feel like?
- Oh, boy...

26:26.436 --> 26:28.298
Because I think I'm in love with John.

26:28.524 --> 26:31.009
It wouldn't be the first time,
and I'm sure it won't be the last.

26:31.602 --> 26:33.705
- What does that mean?
- It means that a lot of people,

26:33.825 --> 26:35.417
particularly alien women, tend to fall

26:35.537 --> 26:37.775
<i>for John Sheppard's
good looks and charm.</i>

26:37.895 --> 26:39.498
Not like me they don't.

26:40.148 --> 26:42.483
He's a bit old for you, don't you think?

26:43.206 --> 26:44.515
I hadn't considered it.

26:44.635 --> 26:46.441
He will, so don't get your hopes up.

26:47.458 --> 26:49.526
You're not going to try
and influence him, are you?

26:49.646 --> 26:51.112
I won't need to. Trust me.

26:53.664 --> 26:55.325
You don't like me very much, do you?

26:56.395 --> 26:58.458
No, that's not true. I...

27:00.336 --> 27:01.964
I don't not like you.

27:03.977 --> 27:05.126
What does that mean?

27:05.921 --> 27:08.750
You have an annoying attitude,
but I'm willing to cut you some slack,

27:08.870 --> 27:11.716
- because you're still just a child.
- <i>Whereas if I were</i>

27:11.877 --> 27:12.943
grown up,

27:13.209 --> 27:16.555
my annoying attitude
would be less excusable?

27:16.715 --> 27:18.833
That's right. An adult would...

27:21.970 --> 27:25.480
- Hey, I don't have an attitude problem.
- And I don't not like you.

27:29.219 --> 27:31.831
Well, that's sweet of you to say.

27:34.459 --> 27:36.825
So you promise not to get between
John and me?

27:38.648 --> 27:39.648
I promise.

27:41.677 --> 27:42.946
I'll give you this...

27:43.066 --> 27:46.074
you're a lot more mature
than the women he usually falls for.

27:48.743 --> 27:50.073
Thank you, Doctor.

28:04.291 --> 28:05.591
<i>What do you got?</i>

28:06.180 --> 28:07.429
Two dead Genii.

28:07.758 --> 28:09.058
It's not pretty.

28:09.292 --> 28:10.859
Multiple puncture wounds.

28:11.936 --> 28:13.278
You mean like teeth marks?

28:13.704 --> 28:14.970
I don't think so.

28:15.654 --> 28:18.617
So... so, what? Claws?
Talons? A very sharp beak?

28:18.777 --> 28:22.265
I don't know. It's not like anything
I've ever seen before.

28:26.158 --> 28:27.163
Over here.

28:36.317 --> 28:39.335
- What kind of creature could do this?
- It doesn't matter.

28:39.455 --> 28:42.367
We don't leave this forest
until all three of them are dead.

28:56.489 --> 28:58.647
What took you so long?
I thought for sure we'd lost you!

28:58.767 --> 29:01.377
I ran into Genii. Had to lie low
until it was safe to move.

29:01.497 --> 29:03.189
- So what happened?
- I don't know,

29:03.309 --> 29:05.307
but whatever that beast thing is,
it's lethal.

29:05.900 --> 29:07.784
I could have told you that.

29:07.904 --> 29:08.666
Also...

29:08.826 --> 29:11.372
the Genii have shoot-to-kill
orders for all of us.

29:12.143 --> 29:12.940
Super.

29:13.060 --> 29:14.960
All right, princess, let's move.

29:22.541 --> 29:23.244
Wait!

29:24.200 --> 29:24.902
What?

29:25.092 --> 29:26.175
Where are you going?

29:26.643 --> 29:28.894
Where does it look like?
We're going back to the settlement.

29:29.133 --> 29:31.327
But we're so close to the ruins.

29:31.820 --> 29:33.086
And it's almost daybreak.

29:33.206 --> 29:36.039
The fact that it's almost daybreak is
a bad thing. We need the cover of night.

29:36.465 --> 29:39.311
I can't come this far
and just turn back.

29:39.431 --> 29:40.462
I refuse.

29:40.582 --> 29:42.805
You know, I still have the unner-stay.

29:43.954 --> 29:46.650
The best thing
you could do is go that way.

29:49.996 --> 29:51.729
That sounded a little weird.

29:52.380 --> 29:54.279
Hating to agree with the child, but...

29:54.693 --> 29:55.769
Give me that.

29:56.783 --> 29:58.828
The beast will avoid the ruins.

29:58.948 --> 30:01.386
- We'll be safe there.
- How far are they?

30:01.546 --> 30:02.804
A half hour or so.

30:02.964 --> 30:04.186
So what do you say?

30:04.306 --> 30:06.692
Well, it's better
than running into the beast.

30:26.367 --> 30:27.917
I was afraid of this.

30:28.350 --> 30:30.238
That's sacred ground. How dare he?

30:30.358 --> 30:31.258
Hey. Hey!

30:32.338 --> 30:34.547
We'll handle this, all right?

30:37.115 --> 30:38.946
- I'll do that.
- I got it. It's okay.

30:39.066 --> 30:41.633
- Really, just... just...
- Steady...

30:42.652 --> 30:44.353
come to papa.

30:44.991 --> 30:46.313
Let's go...

30:51.341 --> 30:52.812
- Hey! Hey.
- What?

30:55.099 --> 30:56.564
You have subdued him.

31:00.248 --> 31:01.570
Now we can go.

31:12.461 --> 31:13.761
Oh! Fascinating.

31:14.000 --> 31:14.975
Ancient?

31:16.763 --> 31:18.507
Yeah. Obviously.

31:19.525 --> 31:20.597
It's weird...

31:21.052 --> 31:23.121
this place seems strangely familiar.

31:26.512 --> 31:29.112
It's even more beautiful
than I imagined.

31:37.318 --> 31:38.663
Something's wrong.

31:39.351 --> 31:40.055
What?

31:40.353 --> 31:41.890
It's not working.

31:42.688 --> 31:45.532
Shouldn't you be, like,
silently meditating or something?

31:47.141 --> 31:48.785
My pendant... it's supposed to glow.

31:50.241 --> 31:51.671
Well, I'll be damned.

31:53.070 --> 31:55.333
- Let me guess.
- Oh, yeah, it's Ancient.

31:55.493 --> 31:56.960
<i>It's the Pendant of Laros.</i>

31:57.686 --> 32:01.435
The queen, and only the true queen,
must return it to the ruins.

32:01.792 --> 32:04.801
Once here, it is to glow
and imbue me with great power.

32:04.961 --> 32:06.970
Your sisters kind of failed
to mention that.

32:07.361 --> 32:09.560
It is one of our greatest secrets.

32:11.142 --> 32:12.725
It's the testing ground.

32:12.885 --> 32:14.852
- What?
- I know what this place is!

32:15.294 --> 32:18.176
I've been reading about it. We've been
looking for it for the last two years.

32:18.296 --> 32:21.155
- I've seen the schematics.
- Share with the class.

32:21.448 --> 32:24.152
Well, believe it or not, this place
actually does control the beast...

32:24.272 --> 32:26.531
- if the beast is what I think it is.
- Which is?

32:26.691 --> 32:29.195
Mini-drones, if I'm right, and
you can usually take that to the bank.

32:29.315 --> 32:32.161
This planet must have been where the
Ancients first developed drone tech.

32:32.321 --> 32:34.433
It was their main testing ground!

32:34.798 --> 32:37.236
That would explain why the Genii
look like swiss cheese.

32:37.356 --> 32:40.120
- The mini-drones went right through'em!
- And that noise the beast was making

32:40.240 --> 32:42.255
was more like an electric
swarm than a growl.

32:44.116 --> 32:45.508
So the pendant is...

32:45.782 --> 32:47.326
Probably some sort of pass-key.

32:47.446 --> 32:50.539
Ancients weren't above protecting
their research, even from each other.

32:50.659 --> 32:52.096
You need more than just the gene

32:52.216 --> 32:54.559
in order to activate or control
the drones, otherwise...

32:55.114 --> 32:56.352
Yes, yes, yes, of course!

32:56.512 --> 32:57.781
It's in auto-protect mode!

32:57.901 --> 33:00.301
They're trolling the forest,
taking out anybody without the gene.

33:00.421 --> 33:02.874
That's why they stayed clear of us
and went straight for the Genii.

33:02.994 --> 33:05.194
The royal pain here must have it,
as well.

33:05.499 --> 33:06.613
Why isn't it working?

33:07.228 --> 33:09.073
Well, maybe because genius over there

33:09.233 --> 33:11.578
- was messing with the crystal tray?
- All right, so?

33:11.698 --> 33:15.133
Well, so give me a second to figure out
how much damage he's done.

33:22.914 --> 33:24.589
The machine is broken.

33:24.886 --> 33:27.064
<i>That's why your pendant isn't glowing.</i>

33:27.184 --> 33:29.546
It's got nothing to do with machines.

33:30.120 --> 33:32.124
If I am worthy of being queen,

33:32.244 --> 33:36.295
the Gods will bestow the power of
pure light and make my pendant glow.

33:39.231 --> 33:42.265
Well, who knows what kind of
wacky rules they've imposed on it.

33:42.385 --> 33:45.276
I mean, I suppose it's possible that
once a generation, the key needs to be

33:45.396 --> 33:48.195
reactivated here. Maybe it's the thing
that allows them to use the Ancient

33:48.356 --> 33:51.041
<i>- tech they have back at the castle.</i>
- It's complicated,

33:51.161 --> 33:54.619
but it will light up.
We just need to make some repairs.

33:55.159 --> 33:56.622
You don't understand.

33:57.937 --> 33:58.956
I've failed.

34:01.390 --> 34:03.730
Maybe I'm not supposed to be queen.

34:04.846 --> 34:05.712
Maybe...

34:06.374 --> 34:09.029
maybe we've come all
this way for nothing.

34:09.149 --> 34:11.217
Trust me, it'll glow.

34:23.612 --> 34:24.588
Wake up.

34:26.702 --> 34:28.013
What'd you do to this thing?

34:28.132 --> 34:29.291
I'm not sure.

34:29.659 --> 34:31.114
I just rearranged the crystals.

34:31.274 --> 34:34.158
Don't tell them a thing. They're
going to kill us one way or the other.

34:34.871 --> 34:36.053
Can you get it to work?

34:36.172 --> 34:38.393
Not quickly. I can come back
with a Jumper and a small team

34:38.513 --> 34:39.650
and get it working.

34:46.422 --> 34:47.235
Listen.

34:49.315 --> 34:51.112
- We're going to head back.
- No!

34:51.743 --> 34:54.420
If I return with a darkened pendant,
I won't be allowed to...

34:54.540 --> 34:57.348
Yes, you will be queen,
I promise you! It's just busted.

34:58.096 --> 35:02.478
This isn't the type of thing where
you got a second chance, John, please.

35:04.147 --> 35:06.232
I can do it. I just need to focus more.

35:12.309 --> 35:13.322
Easy does it.

35:13.860 --> 35:15.244
<i>Huron, come in.</i>

35:16.179 --> 35:17.493
<i>Huron. Come in.</i>

35:19.643 --> 35:22.874
If we don't respond,
they're going to come and investigate.

35:24.985 --> 35:25.835
Huron here.

35:26.289 --> 35:27.378
<i>What's your status?</i>

35:28.061 --> 35:28.768
Good.

35:28.888 --> 35:30.053
<i>Elaborate.</i>

35:31.714 --> 35:33.412
- Real good.
- Help us!

35:35.551 --> 35:37.011
Kinda busy, got to go!

35:37.708 --> 35:40.572
Well, it was worth a shot.
You got to get that thing workin', fast.

35:40.692 --> 35:42.179
Why can't we just run for it?

35:42.299 --> 35:44.988
We're boxed in from all directions.
We've got to get

35:45.108 --> 35:47.356
- those mini-drones working, or...
- Or we die.

36:05.710 --> 36:07.835
You know, you're not exactly
inspiring confidence.

36:08.309 --> 36:09.383
Yeah? How so?

36:09.503 --> 36:12.604
You're hiding behind a foot of solid
rock. How am I supposed to feel out here

36:12.724 --> 36:14.955
with only a cool breeze
between me and the Genii?

36:15.075 --> 36:17.136
You're more than welcome
to come get cover

36:17.297 --> 36:19.527
for yourself, as soon as you're done
with those repairs.

36:19.647 --> 36:22.850
Do you have any idea how many crystal
placement combinations there are?

36:23.098 --> 36:25.578
- More than seven?
- Try 7,000.

36:26.305 --> 36:27.730
Well, that's less than infinite.

36:30.581 --> 36:31.783
All right, look.

36:32.132 --> 36:35.785
It's going to get very,
very noisy when the Genii get here.

36:36.059 --> 36:36.864
Screaming?

36:37.024 --> 36:40.062
No, these guns,
they make a lot of noise.

36:40.411 --> 36:41.742
It's very important

36:41.862 --> 36:44.835
<i>that you stay put and keep
your ears covered, okay?</i>

36:44.955 --> 36:46.791
Shouldn't you give me a gun instead?

36:46.951 --> 36:50.670
You're gonna stay put, cover your ears,
and you're not gonna move, okay?

36:54.814 --> 36:56.467
Son of bitch! I think I got it!

36:58.379 --> 37:00.304
Harmony! What did I just say?

37:14.507 --> 37:15.570
Go, go, go, go!

37:24.301 --> 37:25.413
You're surrounded!

37:26.605 --> 37:29.213
<i>You have limited ammunition,
and I have unlimited men! </i>

37:29.333 --> 37:30.710
We'll take our chances.

37:30.870 --> 37:33.421
If you make this hard,
I will make your death as slow

37:33.581 --> 37:35.423
<i>and as painful as possible.</i>

37:37.777 --> 37:39.385
Okay, what's option number two?

37:40.922 --> 37:42.713
Give us the girl,
and we'll let you go free.

37:42.833 --> 37:43.556
<i>Never!</i>

37:44.028 --> 37:47.397
They would rather die than deal
with the likes of you savages.

37:47.819 --> 37:50.271
<i>When my sisters hear of this,
the Genii will be finished!</i>

37:50.711 --> 37:52.005
Finished, do you hear?

37:52.125 --> 37:54.233
How do you think we knew
how to find you, little one?

37:54.393 --> 37:55.253
You lie!

37:55.941 --> 37:59.447
Come at us with all you have!
I shall silence you once and for all!

38:00.624 --> 38:02.408
Let us handle this, okay?

38:04.699 --> 38:06.115
You have one minute!

38:10.132 --> 38:11.208
It can't be true.

38:11.368 --> 38:13.544
It doesn't matter right now,
to be honest.

38:14.042 --> 38:15.338
How can you say that?

38:16.245 --> 38:17.723
Did you get that thing working?

38:17.843 --> 38:19.862
Yeah, before
they started shooting at it.

38:19.982 --> 38:21.448
So it's broken again?

38:21.568 --> 38:24.138
It was powered up.
50-50 chance it's still operational.

38:24.917 --> 38:26.306
<i>Provide me with cover.</i>

38:26.426 --> 38:29.289
I'll make it to the pedestal,
summon the beast, and smite them.

38:29.409 --> 38:32.326
There'll be no smiting today,
little lady.

38:32.446 --> 38:34.148
You've never even
used that thing before.

38:34.308 --> 38:37.028
But I am the queen,
and the beast is my protector.

38:37.148 --> 38:39.489
It's a little more
complicated than that.

38:41.958 --> 38:44.042
You say anyone with
the Ancient gene can activate it?

38:44.162 --> 38:46.686
Yeah, as long as
they're wearing the pendant.

38:47.044 --> 38:47.954
Exactly!

38:48.114 --> 38:48.955
50-50?

38:49.115 --> 38:51.958
100% chance they'll kill us if
we talk about it for much longer.

38:52.078 --> 38:54.585
- You got a full mag there?
- Locked and loaded.

38:54.745 --> 38:55.638
On three?

38:55.840 --> 38:56.547
Okay.

38:56.795 --> 38:58.218
Yes. Excellent.

38:58.499 --> 38:59.303
One...

39:00.228 --> 39:00.990
two...

39:02.385 --> 39:03.147
three!

39:24.925 --> 39:26.540
What are you waiting for?

39:27.482 --> 39:28.286
Shoot him!

39:39.878 --> 39:40.942
You all right?

39:41.062 --> 39:42.724
Yeah, I'm good. You?

39:42.953 --> 39:43.981
Sure, sure.

39:46.203 --> 39:48.580
That was the bravest thing
I've ever seen.

39:49.553 --> 39:51.545
You're young. I'm sure you'll meet

39:51.812 --> 39:54.189
even braver men
than me as you get older.

39:54.437 --> 39:55.980
Not you, usurper!

39:56.347 --> 39:59.317
<i>You're lucky I like you,
or you would be hung for treason!</i>

39:59.992 --> 40:00.818
But you...

40:01.793 --> 40:03.090
<i>you saved my life.</i>

40:03.950 --> 40:06.716
- I did?
- When the Genii started firing at me,

40:07.106 --> 40:08.367
you threw yourself on me,

40:08.816 --> 40:10.911
<i>- using your own body as a shield.
- Oh, no.</i>

40:11.071 --> 40:14.373
No, no, no. I just... I tripped and fell
on top of you. It was an accident.

40:14.954 --> 40:15.986
And then...

40:16.447 --> 40:17.668
you pulled me to safety.

40:20.084 --> 40:22.173
You don't... don't not like me.

40:23.751 --> 40:24.759
You like me!

40:24.919 --> 40:26.218
No. No, no.

40:26.379 --> 40:27.428
No, I'm...

40:27.588 --> 40:28.288
<i>Yes!</i>

40:28.609 --> 40:31.351
You saved my life
and restored the ruins.

40:31.718 --> 40:35.011
You are a hero, Dr. McKay,
both to me and my people.

40:35.333 --> 40:38.250
Well, I don't know about "hero." I mean,
exceptionally courageous, perhaps...

40:38.370 --> 40:39.658
And modest, too.

40:39.778 --> 40:42.026
It's time to go,
before the Genii come back.

40:42.999 --> 40:44.031
I doubt it.

40:44.983 --> 40:46.280
They are a simple people,

40:46.681 --> 40:49.607
<i>and I'm sure they were
most impressed by your actions.</i>

40:49.944 --> 40:51.577
I, however, was not.

41:01.048 --> 41:02.803
The pendant still glows.

41:03.709 --> 41:05.752
The gods have deemed me worthy.

41:06.439 --> 41:07.927
Now we can go.

41:20.349 --> 41:21.440
You've returned!

41:23.605 --> 41:25.889
What are you doing?
These are my private quarters.

41:26.009 --> 41:29.068
It's all right, Mardola.
They've already searched my room.

41:29.188 --> 41:31.242
- You should allow it.
- Why?

41:31.512 --> 41:33.119
The Genii attacked us.

41:33.542 --> 41:34.561
Oh, well,

41:34.767 --> 41:37.289
it was a good thing Colonel Sheppard
was there to protect you.

41:37.450 --> 41:40.326
They knew the location
of the ruins, Mardola. How?

41:40.446 --> 41:42.670
You ask as if I would know.

41:50.037 --> 41:52.096
You're too young to be queen, Harmony!

41:52.256 --> 41:53.204
Perhaps...

41:54.397 --> 41:56.518
but when you're released from prison,

41:56.695 --> 41:58.352
you'll be too old to remember.

42:09.225 --> 42:10.656
<i>Dr. Rodney McKay</i>

42:10.816 --> 42:12.465
and Colonel John Sheppard,

42:13.227 --> 42:16.412
your contribution to my people
may never be repaid.

42:17.045 --> 42:19.808
Well, we didn't do it for compensation,
Your Highness-ness.

42:19.928 --> 42:20.827
Kiss-ass.

42:21.004 --> 42:23.127
<i>I personally owe you a debt of gratitude</i>

42:23.287 --> 42:26.161
for your help defeating
the regicidal Genii.

42:26.964 --> 42:29.758
I've had one of the Court's
finest artisans feature you

42:29.918 --> 42:32.474
in a rendering of our glorious victory.

42:47.836 --> 42:50.117
Yeah, pretty much how I remember it.
