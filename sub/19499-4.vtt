22:21.623 --> 22:22.753
It was you, wasn't it?

22:23.917 --> 22:26.973
I saw you at the cemetery.
You're mad! I should pull you in.

22:28.675 --> 22:31.405
Go on, then, let the Gestapo
have their way with me!

22:31.961 --> 22:33.813
You might get an
Iron Cross for that one.

22:38.670 --> 22:40.108
Does he know you were involved?

22:40.134 --> 22:42.559
Of course not! I didn't know that...

22:46.425 --> 22:48.348
Doug. Harry.

22:49.940 --> 22:50.965
Here you are.

22:51.427 --> 22:53.182
Got those off the guards.

22:53.602 --> 22:55.255
It's criminal, what they're charging.

22:57.241 --> 23:00.649
You two, er, sorting
out your differences?

23:02.230 --> 23:04.202
We were just talking about
the Highgate bomb,

23:04.790 --> 23:06.972
and how her lot played right
into the Germans' hands.

23:07.928 --> 23:10.350
Martial law is exactly what
the Army wanted!

23:10.561 --> 23:11.858
It won't last.

23:12.459 --> 23:15.305
And it shows the others who have some
fight left in them they're not alone.

23:15.846 --> 23:17.766
- We're still here!
- What? In here?

23:25.640 --> 23:27.229
I'm going to try and get you out.

23:27.950 --> 23:29.370
I'll talk to Kellermann.

23:31.481 --> 23:34.025
What, just me?

23:35.462 --> 23:36.697
What about Sylvia?

23:37.670 --> 23:40.485
For Christ's sake, Doug, don't blame
her for the attack on you.

23:40.510 --> 23:42.085
I shouldn't have told you where she was.

23:42.110 --> 23:43.199
Yeah, well, it's done now.

23:43.225 --> 23:46.765
Yeah, well, forget about us.
We're going to get out anyway.

23:47.095 --> 23:48.167
How?

23:50.008 --> 23:52.370
Sylvia's friends are going to fix
one of the officers.

23:53.393 --> 23:55.054
What, bribe him or kill him?

23:55.310 --> 23:56.390
Funny.

23:57.590 --> 23:59.005
Come on, you've told him enough.

23:59.030 --> 24:02.017
You don't have to do this.
Leave it with me.

24:03.750 --> 24:05.550
Somebody has to look after her.

24:06.411 --> 24:08.013
Go back to your office, Doug.

24:08.710 --> 24:10.999
Go and be with Douggie outside
of the controlled area.

24:14.178 --> 24:16.007
Well, I'd be no use here, then, would I?

24:20.228 --> 24:21.286
What?

24:24.750 --> 24:26.578
I'm willing to do my bit.

24:28.870 --> 24:30.510
But let me get you out.

24:35.270 --> 24:36.510
No.

24:37.726 --> 24:40.966
You've got more important
things to do, Doug.

24:44.883 --> 24:47.329
I'm offering you help, dammit!
Don't you understand?

24:47.588 --> 24:50.462
Tell Joan I'll be home soon, yeah?

24:51.196 --> 24:52.476
Harry!

25:08.270 --> 25:11.645
The Army will be licking their
wounds after the humiliation

25:11.670 --> 25:12.793
of the explosion.

25:13.510 --> 25:17.045
Let General Major Von Ruff
think he won his argument

25:17.070 --> 25:18.991
over the King's horses, hmm?

25:22.675 --> 25:24.795
These are delicate times, my friend.

25:28.424 --> 25:29.464
Now...

25:31.066 --> 25:32.946
What is it that you wanted?

25:35.550 --> 25:37.630
The Army have arrested Harry Woods.

25:54.233 --> 25:55.913
You were right to come to me.

25:57.066 --> 25:59.564
But this won't be easy.

26:02.944 --> 26:04.071
I know, sir.

26:05.140 --> 26:07.660
But I'll be very grateful for
anything you can do.

27:04.873 --> 27:06.490
Well, at least you weren't rounded up.

27:06.663 --> 27:08.530
I'm American. We're immune.

27:10.136 --> 27:11.256
Maybe you are.

27:21.110 --> 27:22.350
So, where are we going?

27:24.017 --> 27:25.847
Ambassador Kennedy's little place.

27:29.910 --> 27:31.461
Tell me, is this American soil?

27:31.487 --> 27:33.157
Not at the ambassador's residence, sir.

27:33.183 --> 27:35.561
So the Germans could come
barging in at any time?

27:35.587 --> 27:38.505
Even they seem to know that would be
a little... provocative.

27:39.105 --> 27:40.400
Here we are.

27:40.426 --> 27:42.881
This is Dan Hapkiss, special attache.

27:42.976 --> 27:44.496
I know who you two are.

27:45.483 --> 27:46.708
Good evening, gentlemen.

27:47.510 --> 27:49.097
Not playing cards tonight?

27:49.479 --> 27:51.113
Sit down. We've just started.

27:51.268 --> 27:53.108
- Miss Barga.
- Thank you.

27:57.043 --> 27:58.083
Please.

27:59.350 --> 28:00.590
I'm fine, thanks.

28:01.790 --> 28:02.944
So...

28:03.509 --> 28:05.117
Things are moving quickly, Douglas.

28:05.675 --> 28:08.844
Dan, here, has been my opposite
number in Washington

28:08.870 --> 28:10.101
for the last year

28:10.127 --> 28:11.565
and he's brought them round to acting on

28:11.590 --> 28:14.662
the intelligence that George's
resistance men have gathered.

28:16.390 --> 28:17.485
Which is?

28:17.510 --> 28:20.110
That the Germans seem damned close
to producing an atomic bomb,

28:20.644 --> 28:21.750
way ahead of the Americans.

28:21.776 --> 28:24.280
And without Spode's calculations,
we're in the dark.

28:24.790 --> 28:27.005
We have no option but to go in
and raid Bringle Sands,

28:27.030 --> 28:29.470
steal what we can and sabotage the rest.

28:32.670 --> 28:34.125
Planning that would take months.

28:34.150 --> 28:37.405
It has taken months. The raid's
in 48 hours, at spring tide.

28:37.734 --> 28:40.634
I thought Ambassador Kennedy was
against America coming into the war.

28:40.967 --> 28:44.599
Shall we say a little marital
scandal is keeping him quiet?

28:45.350 --> 28:48.525
But let's be clear, this is not
America entering the war.

28:48.550 --> 28:51.554
But in return for our help
mounting the raid on the laboratory,

28:52.206 --> 28:54.710
they have agreed to help us
with His Majesty.

28:58.390 --> 29:01.005
Good God, the German Army are really
going to go through with it?

29:01.030 --> 29:02.498
They know nothing about
the raids, of course.

29:02.524 --> 29:04.765
To them they're consolidating power,

29:04.790 --> 29:07.165
squeezing the SS out
by humiliating them.

29:07.190 --> 29:09.805
Their infighting is our good fortune.

29:10.283 --> 29:12.125
It's a chance we really need to seize.

29:12.150 --> 29:14.605
It's not helped by those bloody
renegades setting off

29:14.630 --> 29:15.939
a bomb at Highgate.

29:16.432 --> 29:19.287
Because of that,
half of our men are in hiding now.

29:19.313 --> 29:22.128
I'm having to go down there myself
to organise the patrols

29:22.154 --> 29:23.400
to support the attack.

29:23.461 --> 29:26.279
Without them,
it could be a damn calamity.

29:26.971 --> 29:29.278
So, with George down there,

29:30.110 --> 29:31.296
caught up with all this...

29:33.950 --> 29:35.830
You want me to get the King
to Bringle Sands.

29:37.335 --> 29:40.750
Right now, you're our only
chance of success.

29:41.460 --> 29:44.054
With that pass of yours
you can get through any roadblock.

29:44.723 --> 29:46.668
Now, there's an airstrip near Bringle.

29:46.774 --> 29:48.494
I've set aside some men to secure it.

29:49.154 --> 29:52.249
An American plane will fly
His Majesty out to the Ark Royal

29:52.275 --> 29:55.300
but only if we can get
the King there in time.

29:57.563 --> 29:58.683
Well, Douglas?

30:00.751 --> 30:02.800
You're our best chance
by a country mile.

30:03.510 --> 30:06.481
And that Resistance attack on you
puts you above all suspicion.

30:08.350 --> 30:09.435
It does, doesn't it?

30:11.030 --> 30:12.605
Convenient for you.

30:12.630 --> 30:14.047
For God's sake, Archer.

30:21.919 --> 30:23.094
I'll do it.

30:24.750 --> 30:26.365
If we can get the King away,

30:26.390 --> 30:28.742
the people will realise
the bastards can be thwarted.

30:30.390 --> 30:33.270
Good man. That's grand.

30:35.078 --> 30:37.565
You'll meet Captain Hesse at
The Grenadier public house

30:37.590 --> 30:38.887
at 1800 hours tomorrow.

30:38.953 --> 30:40.613
He'll fill you in with all the details.

30:41.551 --> 30:44.764
Now, the codename for His Majesty
will be Blue-Jacket.

30:44.945 --> 30:46.025
Have you got that?

30:49.025 --> 30:51.011
I'd like to have Harry Woods at my side.

30:51.670 --> 30:53.865
Hopefully Kellermann can have him
released in time.

30:56.112 --> 30:59.367
Harry was involved in
a shooting incident earlier today.

30:59.393 --> 31:02.618
- What?! - He's just hurt, along with
the girl that used to be your clerk.

31:02.899 --> 31:03.906
Sylvia.

31:03.932 --> 31:07.587
They got through the perimeter fence
at the detention camp.

31:07.613 --> 31:09.788
Trying to escape, the sentry said.

31:09.814 --> 31:11.090
Was she hurt too?

31:11.254 --> 31:13.470
How badly we don't know. She got away,

31:13.496 --> 31:16.376
but we have no idea where she is,
poor thing.

31:18.761 --> 31:20.263
So where's Harry now?

31:21.128 --> 31:23.245
The SS secret police have asked
the Army for him.

31:23.270 --> 31:25.005
They say because he's a police officer

31:25.030 --> 31:26.750
that the Army have no right to hold him.

31:29.372 --> 31:31.942
I have to get to Gestapo
Headquarters immediately.

31:31.968 --> 31:34.725
That might make them take
an extra interest in Harry...

31:35.470 --> 31:36.648
and you.

31:37.165 --> 31:39.525
I'm sure they'd take a special
pleasure in sitting you down

31:39.550 --> 31:40.700
and tearing out your fingernails.

31:41.738 --> 31:43.125
Well, that's a risk I'll have to take.

31:43.150 --> 31:45.605
That's as maybe, but it's not
a risk that the organisation

31:45.630 --> 31:46.905
- can afford to take.
- Doug.

31:48.738 --> 31:49.768
He's right.

31:51.190 --> 31:52.732
Well, I have to do something.

31:54.630 --> 31:57.285
We better move. We'll have
to leave through the back.

31:57.310 --> 31:59.793
Dog-walker's passed by three times
in the last hour.

32:00.510 --> 32:01.624
Oh, God.

32:02.230 --> 32:03.944
Er, I think that might be down to me.

32:04.165 --> 32:05.653
How long have they been watching you?

32:06.457 --> 32:08.592
Since yesterday. It's, er...

32:09.092 --> 32:10.430
It's all rather unsettling.

32:12.390 --> 32:13.659
You're a good man, Bernard.

32:29.510 --> 32:30.786
You're not coming in?

32:32.324 --> 32:33.778
I have to find Kellermann.

32:34.870 --> 32:37.179
He's the only chance I have of
getting Harry out of custody.

32:38.674 --> 32:39.912
Will he still be up?

32:40.910 --> 32:42.332
He's a creature of habit.

32:42.703 --> 32:45.743
He seems to feel at home
at Kettner's after midnight.

32:47.683 --> 32:49.322
If you'd met him you'd understand.

32:52.257 --> 32:53.552
You're loyal to Harry.

32:55.031 --> 32:56.081
Of course.

32:57.061 --> 32:59.329
He took me under his wing
right from the start.

33:00.710 --> 33:01.880
He believed in me.

33:04.152 --> 33:05.492
I wish I had his knack.

33:08.737 --> 33:10.011
And his bravery.

33:14.208 --> 33:16.208
What you're going to do is
the bravest of all.

33:18.922 --> 33:20.400
I sent Douggie away.

33:22.310 --> 33:23.750
In case it all goes wrong.

33:25.055 --> 33:26.455
You should get away too.

33:36.051 --> 33:37.451
I'm not going anywhere.

33:38.976 --> 33:41.176
A good journalist never walks
away from a story.

33:49.183 --> 33:51.026
If we get through the next few days...

33:53.071 --> 33:54.270
I've been thinking.

33:56.109 --> 33:57.149
About what?

34:02.190 --> 34:04.691
Maybe you and little Douggie want
to leave all this behind,

34:05.720 --> 34:06.950
come to a safer place?

34:09.625 --> 34:10.725
How could that happen?

34:11.801 --> 34:15.241
You'd just have to ask me
to marry you, that's all.

34:17.867 --> 34:19.418
I know, I know, it's...

34:20.833 --> 34:23.431
It's hard to know what
we really think or feel.

34:25.375 --> 34:27.735
But I think I mean it.

34:30.230 --> 34:31.436
I think.

34:51.239 --> 34:52.280
Good luck.

34:53.476 --> 34:54.538
Barbara.

34:54.985 --> 34:56.116
Yes?

35:04.483 --> 35:06.489
These are the atomic calculations.

35:08.496 --> 35:10.056
Spode photographed them.

35:13.803 --> 35:16.005
Why didn't you give this to Hapkiss
when you had the chance?

35:16.030 --> 35:19.750
Because he and Mayhew may not
survive the next few days.

35:21.230 --> 35:23.750
And whatever they manage to get
out of Bringle Sands...

35:25.338 --> 35:26.878
they're always going to need that.

35:27.870 --> 35:30.351
You're the safer pair of hands
to get it to America.

35:36.658 --> 35:37.883
You're good at this game.

35:42.592 --> 35:43.696
Be careful.

36:14.348 --> 36:16.603
Good fellow, perfect timing.

36:17.004 --> 36:18.474
You were expecting me?

36:19.510 --> 36:22.235
I sent a messenger to your house
but nobody was there.

36:22.261 --> 36:23.302
Take a seat.

36:25.994 --> 36:28.674
I do hope, er, young
Douglas is all right.

36:30.725 --> 36:33.405
What exactly am I perfectly
in time for, sir?

36:37.190 --> 36:41.390
Oh, there he is, with that buffoon,
Sturmbannführer Strauss.

36:45.768 --> 36:46.848
Harry.

36:48.160 --> 36:49.400
Superintendent.

36:51.420 --> 36:53.188
You've been a fool, Sergeant Woods.

36:55.710 --> 36:56.965
If you say so.

36:56.990 --> 37:00.165
Well, I do say so, and so
does Superintendent Archer,

37:00.190 --> 37:02.586
and so does anyone else, if
they are being honest with you.

37:14.430 --> 37:16.702
Can Sergeant Woods be
permitted to sit, sir?

37:16.950 --> 37:19.695
Hmm? Oh, very well, then.

37:25.116 --> 37:28.085
I cannot understand why this
police officer should be held

37:28.110 --> 37:29.585
in your custody, Strauss.

37:29.625 --> 37:30.720
Herr Gruppenführer,

37:30.746 --> 37:33.625
the prisoner was only passed into
my custody this evening.

37:34.000 --> 37:35.285
The duty officer who...

37:35.310 --> 37:38.003
He should not have been arrested,
plain and simple.

37:38.646 --> 37:41.261
That does not excuse his
stupid escape attempt,

37:41.287 --> 37:43.791
but he comes under SS protection.

37:44.066 --> 37:47.964
The Army mistakenly arrested

37:47.990 --> 37:50.413
one of our best detectives, you see?

37:50.552 --> 37:52.069
Yes, Herr Gruppenführer.

37:52.189 --> 37:54.724
And don't keep calling me
<i>Herr</i> Gruppenführer.

37:55.070 --> 37:56.573
No, Gruppenführer.

37:57.070 --> 37:59.205
So you will take this prisoner
straight back to

37:59.230 --> 38:01.925
the Feldgendarmerie and explain
to the Army their grave error

38:01.950 --> 38:03.972
so they can release him properly.

38:04.450 --> 38:05.490
Sir...
