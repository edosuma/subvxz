I'd surprise everyone!

10:20.097 --> 10:21.359

we got company.

10:26.016 --> 10:27.670

what's going on.

10:29.237 --> 10:30.760
I know why

10:31.892 --> 10:34.111

adopting Ka'Maya.

10:34.155 --> 10:35.722
That's what
they came down to tell us.

10:35.765 --> 10:37.549
I don't know why
they're acting so cagey
about it, though.

10:37.593 --> 10:39.551
-Am I right?
-I don't know, maybe.

10:43.860 --> 10:46.254
STEF:
Well, this is absolutely
delicious, thank you.

10:46.297 --> 10:48.604
I agree. Our compliments
to the chef.

10:48.648 --> 10:50.780
-To Dennis and Isabella.
-Hear! Hear!

10:50.824 --> 10:52.826
I didn't do much.
Dennis is the culinary genius.

10:52.869 --> 10:54.741
Don't sell yourself short.

10:54.784 --> 10:58.222

without his sous chef.

10:58.266 --> 11:01.530

on the road with Margaret Cho?

11:01.573 --> 11:03.837
A dream come true.
I'm still processing.

11:03.880 --> 11:06.100
Yeah, I can't believe it.
Epic.

11:06.143 --> 11:07.928
Malika, how's
the transition been

11:07.971 --> 11:09.581
from activism to politics?

11:09.625 --> 11:12.454
Hmm, feels
too soon to tell.

11:12.497 --> 11:14.151
But how's it going
in the state assembly?

11:14.195 --> 11:16.153
Well, even being
in the majority,

11:16.197 --> 11:18.503
getting things done
is still an uphill battle.

11:18.547 --> 11:21.898
Well, the governor just approved
a bill that Lena coauthored

11:21.942 --> 11:23.683
to shift certain
emergency response calls

11:23.726 --> 11:25.075
from law enforcement

11:25.119 --> 11:27.338
to trained mental health
professionals.

11:27.382 --> 11:29.036
So important.
Congratulations.

JOAQUIN: Just, uh...
Just curious.

11:30.733 --> 11:33.693
Where do you stand
on the whole
defunding police?

11:33.736 --> 11:36.565
I... think
it's up to the cities.

11:36.608 --> 11:37.740
They control the budgets.

11:37.784 --> 11:41.048
Hmm. Kind of dodged
the question there.

MARIANA:
Joaquin is a journalist.

11:43.093 --> 11:45.443
Just in case you're wondering
why everything feels
like an interrogation.

11:45.487 --> 11:48.403
Yeah, I just-- I don't believe
there are any good cops.

11:48.446 --> 11:50.753
Not as long as they put blue
before duty, you know?

11:50.797 --> 11:51.928
My mom Stef was a cop.

11:53.103 --> 11:54.191
Oh.

11:54.235 --> 11:55.236
STEF: And while
I strongly disagree

11:55.279 --> 11:57.107
that there
are no good cops, um,

11:57.151 --> 11:59.544
I have seen
the issues firsthand.

11:59.588 --> 12:02.765
We definitely need reform,
but I do not believe

12:02.809 --> 12:06.160
that it's, uh, it's possible
to abolish police entirely.

12:06.203 --> 12:07.465
Why not?

12:07.509 --> 12:08.684
LENA: You know,
most of my voters,

12:08.728 --> 12:10.207
they hear,
"Defund the police,"

12:10.251 --> 12:12.514
and they're scared off
any conversation about reform.

12:12.557 --> 12:15.517
Well, people found
Black Lives Matter
too confronting at first.

12:15.560 --> 12:17.867

to take a bold stance, you know?

So now he wants to talk
in the morning.

Sweetheart, please
put away the phone.
We're at dinner--

12:33.491 --> 12:35.015
-I hate texting.
-STEF: Well, then don't.

12:35.058 --> 12:36.712
I mean, how do you read
anyone's tone?

12:36.756 --> 12:39.323
I agree. You have to put
an exclamation point
after everything,

12:39.367 --> 12:40.803
so people don't
take it the wrong way.

12:40.847 --> 12:42.805
Yeah! And what about
a thumbs up?

12:42.849 --> 12:45.199
Personally, I've always read
that as complacent.

12:45.242 --> 12:47.201
And everyone
loves everything.

12:47.244 --> 12:49.420
I mean, why are people
more effusive over texts

12:49.464 --> 12:50.770

12:50.813 --> 12:53.076

That's disgusting.

13:05.262 --> 13:07.351
You do know
that we're your family?

13:07.395 --> 13:08.744
And I don't think
anyone else

13:08.788 --> 13:11.312
cares to imagine you sexting
with your boyfriend.

13:11.355 --> 13:13.053
That's another issue.
