00:40.709 --> 00:43.166
Oh, my God, for my birthday!

00:43.166 --> 00:44.583
What a surprise!

00:44.583 --> 00:45.875
You guys!

00:45.875 --> 00:47.500
I almost had a heart attack!

00:50.375 --> 00:52.291
Okay, I got my birthday
all planned out.

00:52.291 --> 00:54.875
I want us all to drink
a bunch of Four Lokos,

00:54.875 --> 00:56.583
then swim across the lake
after midnight.

00:56.583 --> 00:58.417
I really don't think
it's that far across.

00:58.417 --> 00:59.667
It looks real close.

00:59.667 --> 01:00.875
Roger, didn't you
just have a birthday

01:00.875 --> 01:02.125
a couple of months ago?

01:02.125 --> 01:03.959
Yeah, that's right.

01:03.959 --> 01:06.458
You made us ride ATVs
on Ted Nugent's ranch

01:06.458 --> 01:08.041
without his permission.

01:08.041 --> 01:10.250
Fine, you caught me.
It's not my birthday.

01:10.250 --> 01:12.417
But that's the only day
of the year

01:12.417 --> 01:15.041
I can get you nervous Nellies
to do anything adventurous.

01:15.041 --> 01:17.041
So, who's in
for the Loko lake swim?

01:17.041 --> 01:19.333
Look, Roger, we're all
for trying new things,

01:19.333 --> 01:20.667
but that sounds
too dangerous.

01:20.667 --> 01:22.291
Yeah, if new things
are so great,

01:22.291 --> 01:24.333
where have they been
all this time?

01:24.333 --> 01:28.083
Well, well, well,
what have we here?

01:28.083 --> 01:31.417
Discount coupons
to the American Safety Museum?!

01:31.417 --> 01:33.208
Using these!

01:33.208 --> 01:36.542
Oh, look, they're doing an
exhibit on Augustus Seatbelt,

01:36.542 --> 01:39.125
the inventor of the airbag.

01:39.125 --> 01:40.750
Hello?!

01:40.750 --> 01:43.625
We're not going
to any stupid safety museum.

01:43.625 --> 01:46.083
Why doesn't anyone
ever listen to me?

01:47.500 --> 01:49.291
You guys will not believe
what's in this towel.

01:49.291 --> 01:51.125
A baby! A baby
you gave birth to

01:51.125 --> 01:52.792
and you didn't even know
you were pregnant!

01:52.792 --> 01:54.333
It just popped out
on the lawn.

01:54.333 --> 01:56.834
You thought you were just
taking a "D" on the lawn,

01:56.834 --> 01:58.166
but surprise,
it wasn't a deuce,

01:58.166 --> 02:00.375
it was a baby
and it's in that towel!

02:00.375 --> 02:01.875
Show me that baby!

02:01.875 --> 02:04.625
No, it's a raccoon.

02:04.625 --> 02:06.458
What did you do
with your baby?!

02:06.458 --> 02:08.125
Look at this adorable guy!

02:08.125 --> 02:09.667
I'm gonna call him Cuddles...

02:09.667 --> 02:12.250
after the cat he was eating
when I found him.

02:12.250 --> 02:14.417
Oh, my God, you won't do
my dangerous birthday plan,

02:14.417 --> 02:16.083
but you're gonna
let her keep

02:16.083 --> 02:17.500
a wild animal
in the house?

02:17.500 --> 02:19.542
She got a pet.
I think it's nice.

02:19.542 --> 02:21.083
Uch, forget this.

02:21.083 --> 02:23.500
I'm gonna go do something
on the edge like skydiving,

02:23.500 --> 02:25.875
or trying on underwear
at Marshall's.

02:26.959 --> 02:28.542
Oh, hey, Roger,
there you are.

02:28.542 --> 02:30.208
I wanted
to ask your advice.

02:30.208 --> 02:33.000
Finally! Someone who wants
to hear what I have to say.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.166
So I have a crush
on this girl,

02:35.166 --> 02:36.625
but she only goes
for jocks.

02:36.625 --> 02:38.583
Well, she sounds
too smart for you, Steve.

02:38.583 --> 02:40.083
I suggest
you find somebody else,

02:40.083 --> 02:41.625
'cause you'll never be a jock.

02:41.625 --> 02:44.000
That's it!
I'll become a jock!

02:44.000 --> 02:46.709
You'll be as good a jock
as you are a listener.

02:49.041 --> 02:52.166
They should've listened to me.
That was an epic swim.

02:52.166 --> 02:53.792
I think my favorite part
was when

02:53.792 --> 02:56.000
that guy drowned trying
to save me.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.875
Now, if only there was a way

02:57.875 --> 02:59.375
I could remember this day
forever.

02:59.375 --> 03:01.667
Oh, my God, a red-light camera!

03:08.709 --> 03:10.709
Now if this light would
just turn red,

03:10.709 --> 03:12.667
we'd have one hell
of a picture.

03:12.667 --> 03:13.792
Hey, come on!

03:13.792 --> 03:15.000
What are you
waiting for?

03:15.000 --> 03:16.667
Blow it out your ass!

03:39.667 --> 03:41.834
Roger, thank God you're awake!

03:41.834 --> 03:43.125
You've been in a coma.

03:43.125 --> 03:45.834
Oh, my God,
how long was I out?

03:45.834 --> 03:47.291
This long?
Or this long?

03:47.291 --> 03:48.750
The first one.

03:48.750 --> 03:51.000
Roger, I just want to tell you
how happy we are

03:51.000 --> 03:53.041
that we didn't go along
with your stupid plan.

03:53.041 --> 03:56.041
Yes, if you weren't so easy
to dismiss,

03:56.041 --> 03:57.709
we could be in here with you.

03:57.709 --> 04:00.125
Mom, Dad, thank you
for not listening to Roger.

04:00.125 --> 04:02.333
Well, this has been
a grand reunion.

04:02.333 --> 04:03.458
Roger, you're awake,

04:03.458 --> 04:05.166
which means you're
probably alive.

04:05.166 --> 04:07.000
Let's check
your vitals.

04:13.125 --> 04:16.500
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye!

04:16.500 --> 04:17.750
A body...

04:17.750 --> 04:18.834
a lawsuit...

04:18.834 --> 04:21.041
Doctor, I just
had a vision.

04:21.041 --> 04:22.500
You're being
fired by a baby.

04:22.500 --> 04:25.750
Well, that's impossible,
unless it was Dr. Baby,

04:25.750 --> 04:28.250
the baby who's in charge
of this hospital.

04:28.250 --> 04:31.000
But I assure you,
your vision wasn't real.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.458
It was nothing but
a postcomatic delusion.

04:33.458 --> 04:35.583
You just need
a little more rest.

04:35.583 --> 04:38.458
I think your family should
probably leave.

04:38.458 --> 04:40.792
I'm sorry, what?
I thought you guys should go.

04:40.792 --> 04:42.041
Yeah, so did we.

04:42.041 --> 04:44.959
I swear, what I saw
seemed so real.

04:44.959 --> 04:46.542
I think you're
gonna lose your job.

04:46.542 --> 04:48.458
There's nothing
to worry about.

04:48.458 --> 04:51.208
I'm a dedicated professional
with a spotless record...

04:51.208 --> 04:53.458
You see, when I'm engaged
with a patient,

04:53.458 --> 04:56.250
it's as if the whole world
disappears around me.

04:57.375 --> 05:00.333
Oh, no, the bad sound.

05:00.333 --> 05:01.583
He's dead!

05:01.583 --> 05:04.875
This was clearly
your fault, Doctor!

05:04.875 --> 05:07.000
Damn it!
It's gonna take more

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
than a game of peekaboo
with Dr. Baby

05:09.000 --> 05:10.458
to get out of this one.

05:12.041 --> 05:14.208
Oh, my God, I was right!

05:14.208 --> 05:15.542
This was my vision!

05:15.542 --> 05:17.875
Ma'am? Ma'am, I was right.

05:19.250 --> 05:22.125
I see you on a beach...
with a guy!

05:22.125 --> 05:24.583
I wouldn't dread
hanging out with him.

05:24.583 --> 05:26.792
Your new boyfriend
has dreadlocks.

05:26.792 --> 05:28.125
How dare you?!

05:28.125 --> 05:30.625
I'll never love
anyone but my husband.

05:30.625 --> 05:32.583
I'm here to gather
the dead man, mon.

05:32.583 --> 05:36.041
Whoa, you look sexy
when you cry.

05:36.041 --> 05:39.917
Really? No one's ever noticed
that about me before.

05:39.917 --> 05:42.667
How about I buy you
a Red Stripe?

05:47.250 --> 05:50.458
And that's when I was sure
that I could see the future.

05:50.458 --> 05:52.750
Roger, the last time you thought
you could see the future,

05:52.750 --> 05:54.792
you said that Rodney would
have the best party.

05:54.792 --> 05:57.333
But his parents came home
early and ruined
the whole thing.

05:58.375 --> 06:00.834
It's here!

06:03.375 --> 06:06.834
One Rowflex and
five containers
of protein powder.

06:08.250 --> 06:11.208
Thanks to all this,
I'm about to become a jock!

06:20.917 --> 06:23.500
You're never gonna use
any of that stuff!

06:23.500 --> 06:25.333
Of course
I'm gonna use it!

06:25.333 --> 06:27.917
And I'm starting with
a protein shake right now.

06:31.542 --> 06:32.583
Mom?

06:32.583 --> 06:34.250
All right, give it to me.

06:37.542 --> 06:40.875
I see a desperate man
with a clip-on tie...

06:40.875 --> 06:42.083
a set of keys...

06:42.083 --> 06:44.166
Francine, you're getting
a new car!

06:44.166 --> 06:46.125
That's ridiculous, Roger.

06:46.125 --> 06:48.542
I just got a new car
and I love it.

06:48.542 --> 06:51.291
It's the same car
that Matt Damon drove

06:51.291 --> 06:52.959
in We Bought a Zoo.

06:52.959 --> 06:56.291
I like to drive around and
pretend I have zoo problems.

06:56.291 --> 06:59.041
"Oh, my God, what am I
gonna do about my zoo?"

06:59.041 --> 07:00.166
Right?

07:00.166 --> 07:01.625
It's time!

07:01.625 --> 07:04.166
Everybody ready to go
to the American Safety Museum?

07:04.166 --> 07:06.959
Interesting. It says here
autoerotic asphyxiation

07:06.959 --> 07:09.333
is the number one
cause of awkward funerals.

07:09.333 --> 07:10.792
Ooh, they have a picture?

07:19.417 --> 07:21.792
Oh, my God, you can't go!

07:21.792 --> 07:23.417
Horrible things will happen!

07:23.417 --> 07:24.583
Roger, what
could happen?

07:24.583 --> 07:26.166
It's the
Safety Museum.

07:26.166 --> 07:28.625
Yeah, it's not like
it's the Natural History Museum,

07:28.625 --> 07:30.792
full of dangerous ideas
and attitudes.

07:30.792 --> 07:34.166
Ignore him, Stan.
We can take my car.

07:37.250 --> 07:39.917
You have to believe me!
You're making a huge mistake!

07:39.917 --> 07:41.542
Were you talking to me?

07:41.542 --> 07:43.917
'Cause I was only gonna try
it this once.

07:43.917 --> 07:46.875
I have a paper due
in the morning.

07:55.083 --> 07:59.750
You have been randomly
selected for racial profiling.

07:59.750 --> 08:01.792
Hoo-hoo-hoo,
this is so real!

08:01.792 --> 08:04.834
Stan, this museum
has some great exhibits.

08:04.834 --> 08:07.542
Yeah, let's go check out
the "Kobe Bryant Encounter."

08:07.542 --> 08:10.417
Do you want to come
up to my hotel room?

08:10.417 --> 08:11.792
Sure!

08:11.792 --> 08:13.417
I think we should move on.

08:13.417 --> 08:16.875
No, I know
I can get this!

08:16.875 --> 08:19.625
Do you want to come
up to my hotel room?

08:19.625 --> 08:22.542
As long as you have a T-shirt
I can sleep in.

08:22.542 --> 08:24.333
Forget it. This is impossible.

08:26.417 --> 08:28.834
Is this an exhibit,
or is this just a wet floor?

08:28.834 --> 08:30.500
I don't know.
I just started.

08:30.500 --> 08:32.500
The last tour guide
got fired yesterday.

08:32.500 --> 08:34.250
She was not happy.

08:34.250 --> 08:36.166
Hey, there she is. Hi, Helen!

08:36.166 --> 08:39.333
Safety off!

08:39.333 --> 08:41.709
We gotta get
out of here!

08:43.125 --> 08:45.709
It's just a really good replica
of an emergency exit!

08:45.709 --> 08:48.125
It's so accurate!

08:53.834 --> 08:56.208
This isn't real either!

08:56.208 --> 08:57.750
None of it's real!

08:57.750 --> 09:00.291
There are no actual safety
precautions in this museum!

09:00.291 --> 09:01.917
What do we do?!

09:01.917 --> 09:03.625
I'll tell you
what to do...

09:03.625 --> 09:05.041
if you're ready
to listen.

09:05.041 --> 09:06.667
Roger! What are you
doing here?!

09:06.667 --> 09:08.667
Don't worry,
I know everything
that's gonna happen.

09:08.667 --> 09:10.041
Hayley, take the traffic cones

09:10.041 --> 09:11.792
and make them
into a "U" over there!

09:11.792 --> 09:13.250
Francine,
grab that wheelchair!

09:13.250 --> 09:14.709
Stan, get
that fire extinguisher!

09:14.709 --> 09:16.709
Steve, put
that bulletproof vest on!

09:16.709 --> 09:20.000
Wait a minute,
shouldn't we all get vests?

09:22.458 --> 09:24.125
I wrote this
14 minutes ago,

09:24.125 --> 09:25.500
because in my vision,

09:25.500 --> 09:27.125
you asked me that
exact stupid question.

09:27.125 --> 09:29.250
Now do what I say!

09:40.250 --> 09:42.083
Oh, no,
they're gonna trample us!

09:42.083 --> 09:44.125
Just stay behind the cones!

09:49.834 --> 09:51.583
Oh, my God, it hurts!

09:51.583 --> 09:53.834
Why didn't you just have me
stand somewhere else?!

09:53.834 --> 09:56.333
Less fun.
Everybody climb on!

10:07.750 --> 10:09.875
Oh, my God, Roger, you saved...

10:09.875 --> 10:12.542
Hold on.
Wait for it.

10:14.792 --> 10:16.375
My car!

10:16.375 --> 10:19.417
And I'm pretty sure that
warrants a trip to Cold Stone.

10:19.417 --> 10:22.083
Roger, you were right
about everything!

10:22.083 --> 10:23.834
We should have
listened to you.

10:23.834 --> 10:25.667
Oh, I'll accept
your apology.

10:25.667 --> 10:28.166
And the lanyard you made me
at Camp Shoulda Woulda Coulda.

10:28.166 --> 10:30.834
I can't believe that Roger can
see the future.

10:30.834 --> 10:32.000
Now hold on.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
I don't know
if it proves that.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.750
You know that note
I gave you?

10:35.750 --> 10:36.834
Turn it over.

10:36.834 --> 10:38.625
This is my
cell phone number.

10:38.625 --> 10:41.125
Excuse me, Miss.
Are you all right?

10:41.125 --> 10:43.208
Light him up, girl.

10:43.208 --> 10:44.750
He's not gonna call.

10:44.750 --> 10:46.542
He thinks you could
lose ten pounds.

10:46.542 --> 10:48.166
But that's not why
he doesn't call.

10:48.166 --> 10:49.750
He dies in that fire.

10:49.750 --> 10:52.458
So you didn't need to tell me
about the ten pounds.

10:52.458 --> 10:54.291
Somebody needed
to tell you.

10:57.667 --> 11:00.709
I can't believe Roger
can predict the future.

11:00.709 --> 11:01.959
Yeah, but, like,

11:01.959 --> 11:03.917
compared to people
from the past,

11:03.917 --> 11:05.625
like, to them,

11:05.625 --> 11:07.834
like, we are the
future to them.

11:09.125 --> 11:11.125
I'm definitely
feeling it now.

11:12.166 --> 11:13.625
That was amazing,
Roger!

11:13.625 --> 11:15.291
See what happens
when you listen to me?

11:15.291 --> 11:16.583
He picked
every horse!

11:16.583 --> 11:18.458
Roger's
unbelievable!

11:18.458 --> 11:20.375
He...
Knew that you'd want to eat
chili dogs for lunch.

11:20.375 --> 11:22.083
And then he...
Knew in the third race

11:22.083 --> 11:24.291
it'd take three bullets to put
down Daddy's Lucky Girl.

11:24.291 --> 11:26.250
And now I'm...
Getting tired of me
interrupting you?

11:26.250 --> 11:27.750
How did you...
Know?

11:27.750 --> 11:29.750
You just gave me goose bumps!

11:29.750 --> 11:30.875
I love it!

11:30.875 --> 11:32.625
Speaking of love,
Roger,

11:32.625 --> 11:34.250
there's another girl
in my class

11:34.250 --> 11:35.750
I think I have
a pretty good shot with.

11:35.750 --> 11:37.375
Oh?
Well, allow me.

11:37.375 --> 11:38.458
Come here, you...

11:52.542 --> 11:53.667
Roger, what's
so funny?

11:53.667 --> 11:54.709
Nothing.

11:54.709 --> 11:56.083
I say go for it.

12:01.166 --> 12:03.458
Hey, uh, I was gonna go
take a dip in the pool.

12:03.458 --> 12:05.458
How-how's that
work out for me?

12:05.458 --> 12:07.375
Stan, I'm not wasting
my gift on that.

12:07.375 --> 12:08.375
Come on, Roger.

12:08.375 --> 12:10.000
Touch it.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.500
You drop a load
in the pool.

12:11.500 --> 12:14.083
Wait, no.

12:12.500 --> 12:14.083
It's a Baby Ruth.

12:14.083 --> 12:15.750
That's a scene
from Caddyshack...

12:15.750 --> 12:17.250
which I'm trying
to watch.

12:17.250 --> 12:18.750
Do I end up
watching it with you?

12:18.750 --> 12:20.750
Yes, and you annoy me
the whole time

12:20.750 --> 12:21.792
with your
questions.

12:21.792 --> 12:23.500
Oh.

12:23.500 --> 12:25.834
What kind of
questions?

12:29.917 --> 12:31.917
Roger, am I gonna
like this salad?

12:31.917 --> 12:33.375
Should I be taking
smaller bites?

12:33.375 --> 12:35.125
Roger, am I about to say
something funny?

12:35.125 --> 12:36.542
I want to say
something funny.

12:36.542 --> 12:38.166
Is that enough?

12:38.166 --> 12:40.291
Is... is... is-is that...

12:40.291 --> 12:41.542
Is that too much?

12:41.542 --> 12:43.083
How... how 'bout...
how 'bout now?

12:43.083 --> 12:44.542
Steve, dump that and get
yourself another salad.

12:44.542 --> 12:46.041
Why?

12:46.041 --> 12:47.250
Does something happen
to me if I eat this salad?

12:47.250 --> 12:48.875
No, I'm just using
common sense.

12:48.875 --> 12:51.333
Well, can't you just have
a vision so I can be sure?

12:51.333 --> 12:52.625
So it doesn't matter
what I think?

12:52.625 --> 12:54.125
No, we don't care
what you think,

12:54.125 --> 12:56.291
we care what you see.

12:57.333 --> 12:58.625
Well, fine.

12:58.625 --> 12:59.917
If that's all
you're after...

12:59.917 --> 13:01.959
Wait, where are
you going?

13:01.959 --> 13:03.208
Should we go
with you?

13:03.208 --> 13:05.333
Should I have even
left the kitchen?

13:05.333 --> 13:07.000
Look, no more
questions.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.417
I need to take
a thinkin' drive.

13:08.417 --> 13:09.667
Wait, wait,
you can't leave!

13:09.667 --> 13:10.834
I have homework
tonight!

13:10.834 --> 13:12.125
Is it gonna be
on the test tomorrow

13:12.125 --> 13:13.333
or can I blow
it off?

13:13.333 --> 13:14.667
Should I take
a bath tonight

13:14.667 --> 13:16.792
or will I fall
asleep and drown?

13:16.792 --> 13:17.875
Do I have to go
to the bathroom?

13:17.875 --> 13:19.166
Look, you guys are on your own.

13:19.166 --> 13:20.291
I'm outta here.

13:20.291 --> 13:21.709
At least let us
come with you!

13:21.709 --> 13:23.125
No, you should...

13:23.125 --> 13:24.667
you should... you should
probably stay here.

13:24.667 --> 13:26.291
Why? Are we all gonna die
if we come with you?

13:26.291 --> 13:27.667
Yes.

13:27.667 --> 13:29.000
That.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.375
You're all gonna die

13:30.375 --> 13:32.375
if you leave the house.

13:32.375 --> 13:34.333
Slam that door if
I get really rich soon!

13:36.458 --> 13:39.250
Oh, so close!

13:40.917 --> 13:43.208
Well, I wanted them
to listen to me.

13:43.208 --> 13:45.458
Didn't work out so well,
though, did it?

13:45.458 --> 13:47.458
No, sir.

13:47.458 --> 13:49.041
There might be a lesson
to learn from this

13:49.041 --> 13:50.834
if I were the kind of guy
who could learn lessons.

13:50.834 --> 13:52.333
But lessons are not for me.

13:52.333 --> 13:53.917
Lessons are for school boys.

13:53.917 --> 13:55.208
School boys are for me!

13:55.208 --> 13:56.208
Red light!

14:03.959 --> 14:06.083
Ah, what a restful coma.

14:06.083 --> 14:07.500
How long have
I been out?

14:07.500 --> 14:08.959
Three weeks.

14:08.959 --> 14:10.583
We would have been able
to revive you sooner,

14:10.583 --> 14:12.834
but Dr. Stack was
the coma expert

14:12.834 --> 14:14.875
and he got fired
and sued into poverty

14:14.875 --> 14:17.500
by a grieving widow and
her Rastafarian fiancé.

14:17.500 --> 14:18.625
Huh.

14:18.625 --> 14:20.667
So... can I get
an orange juice,

14:20.667 --> 14:23.000
or is there a long-ass
story about that, too?

14:23.000 --> 14:24.250
Lunch'll be here
in 20 minutes.

14:24.250 --> 14:25.333
You can wait
till then.

14:25.333 --> 14:26.709
Hmm.
Nice attitude.

14:26.709 --> 14:28.875
Let's see
how you die!

14:28.875 --> 14:30.000
Wait!

14:30.000 --> 14:31.208
I'm not getting
any visions.

14:31.208 --> 14:33.250
My powers are gone!

14:33.250 --> 14:35.583
But I haven't
lost mine.

14:35.583 --> 14:38.333
Mind Quad!

14:38.333 --> 14:41.125
Sounds like you're
thirsty, friend.

14:52.375 --> 14:54.417
I'm not gonna drink from
the same glass as him.

14:54.417 --> 14:55.792
He's gross.

15:00.375 --> 15:03.208
So you had powers
and now you lost them?

15:03.208 --> 15:04.333
It's like me.

15:04.333 --> 15:06.083
In my country,
I'm doctor.

15:06.083 --> 15:07.458
Really?
What kind of doctor?

15:07.458 --> 15:09.375
Dah, you caught me.

15:09.375 --> 15:10.834
I'm lying.

15:13.125 --> 15:14.500
What the...

15:16.125 --> 15:17.917
Roger, thank God you're back!

15:17.917 --> 15:19.166
Everybody, Roger's back!

15:19.166 --> 15:21.583
Oh, Roger,
what a relief!

15:21.583 --> 15:23.542
We don't have
to be scared anymore.

15:23.542 --> 15:26.500
Yeah, maybe we can
leave the house now.

15:26.500 --> 15:27.875
Wait a minute.

15:27.875 --> 15:29.291
You haven't left
the house in three weeks?

15:29.291 --> 15:31.375
You told us we'd
all die if we did.

15:31.375 --> 15:33.291
And all of your
fortunes have come true!

15:33.291 --> 15:35.333
Huh.
I guess I did say that.

15:35.333 --> 15:36.709
But how have you survived?

15:36.709 --> 15:37.959
It hasn't been easy.

15:37.959 --> 15:39.625
The toilet paper ran
out before the food,

15:39.625 --> 15:40.959
so that was gross.

15:40.959 --> 15:42.542
But when we started
eating the couch,

15:42.542 --> 15:44.041
we stopped needing
toilet paper.

15:44.041 --> 15:46.000
The stuffing wipes
itself on the way out.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.667
Okay, this is bad.

15:47.667 --> 15:49.083
Wait, wait, where's Klaus?

15:49.083 --> 15:50.375
I'm right here.

15:50.375 --> 15:52.333
Oh, my God, Klaus,

15:52.333 --> 15:53.709
you're living in
your own filth.

15:53.709 --> 15:55.000
I try not to talk

15:55.000 --> 15:56.500
so it doesn't
get in my mouth.

15:58.291 --> 16:00.208
Ugh, it got
in my mouth.

16:00.208 --> 16:01.875
Brissam
beeginch?

16:01.875 --> 16:02.875
R-Rettehsat?

16:02.875 --> 16:04.375
Okay, what is that?

16:04.375 --> 16:07.667
Oh, in your absence
Steve's forgotten English.

16:07.667 --> 16:08.834
Eng...

16:08.834 --> 16:10.375
Engrish.

16:10.375 --> 16:12.667
How did my absence
in any way affect

16:12.667 --> 16:14.709
Steve's handle on
the English language?

16:14.709 --> 16:16.375
I haven't even
been gone a month.

16:16.375 --> 16:18.333
Steve...

16:18.333 --> 16:20.166
Mo-onth.

16:20.166 --> 16:21.208
All right, all right.

16:21.208 --> 16:22.625
Before I left, I told you guys

16:22.625 --> 16:24.250
not to leave the house
and you embraced it.

16:24.250 --> 16:25.625
Now I'm telling you you'll die

16:25.625 --> 16:27.250
if you don't get
out of this house.

16:27.250 --> 16:28.500
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

16:28.500 --> 16:29.709
Don't you want to
have a vision,

16:29.709 --> 16:30.709
make sure it's safe?

16:30.709 --> 16:32.166
Oh, uh,
yeah, sure.

16:33.625 --> 16:35.709
Yes, my vision says
you will be super safe.

16:35.709 --> 16:37.291
Get out there!

16:47.959 --> 16:49.959
Soba slasha on...

16:49.959 --> 16:51.000
Steve's right.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.500
It's just
the sprinklers.

16:55.667 --> 16:57.000
Whoops.

16:58.709 --> 17:00.083
Flaps flaps ze zap zap!

17:00.083 --> 17:02.333
It's not safe!
It's not safe!

17:02.333 --> 17:03.291
We almost got killed.

17:04.834 --> 17:05.792
Steve's right.

17:05.792 --> 17:07.583
You lied to us.

17:07.583 --> 17:09.083
Uch, you got me.

17:09.083 --> 17:10.333
I lost my powers.

17:10.333 --> 17:12.000
Now we can go back
to our normal lives.

17:12.000 --> 17:12.959
Isn't that great?

17:12.959 --> 17:14.208
No, it's not great!

17:14.208 --> 17:16.291
Without your powers,
we have no idea

17:16.291 --> 17:18.291
what dangers are lurking
outside this house!

17:18.291 --> 17:20.917
Yeah, but there is nothing
you can do about it.

17:22.333 --> 17:23.959
How useless was that Costco

17:23.959 --> 17:26.125
five-pack of hammers now,
Francine?

17:26.125 --> 17:28.333
Look, I'm helping!

17:28.333 --> 17:29.875
You guys,
listen...

17:32.917 --> 17:34.166
Oh, my God, what was that?

17:34.166 --> 17:35.291
I don't know!

17:35.291 --> 17:36.458
Let's hide in
the basement!

17:36.458 --> 17:38.041
Steve, your
English is back.

17:38.041 --> 17:39.959
Oh, I was just doing that
to make you guys laugh.

17:45.917 --> 17:47.291
My protein powder!

17:47.291 --> 17:48.417
There are tracks in it.

17:48.417 --> 17:50.625
We got tracks!

17:54.000 --> 17:55.417
Somebody used
my Rowflex!

17:55.417 --> 17:57.500
And it's set to
the highest strength level.

17:57.500 --> 17:58.542
Cuddles!

17:58.542 --> 17:59.792
I forgot about him.

17:59.792 --> 18:00.750
He must've escaped.

18:00.750 --> 18:02.291
Wait a minute.

18:02.291 --> 18:04.083
You don't think he
got into my protein powder

18:04.083 --> 18:05.458
and then started and stuck with

18:05.458 --> 18:07.125
a hard-core workout regimen,
do you?

18:07.125 --> 18:10.792
Oh, God, how big do you think
he could have gotten?

18:10.792 --> 18:12.834
Hmm, I'd say about
eight feet tall.

18:12.834 --> 18:14.125
Oh, how do
you know?

18:14.125 --> 18:15.667
Did you have
a vision of it?

18:15.667 --> 18:17.750
He's standing
right there.

18:19.166 --> 18:20.375
Run!

18:26.000 --> 18:27.250
You know what?

18:27.250 --> 18:28.667
I think we can
make this work.

18:28.667 --> 18:30.458
We'll just all live here
the rest of our lives.

18:30.458 --> 18:31.542
I call the tub!

18:31.542 --> 18:33.125
You guys are
ready to live

18:33.125 --> 18:35.208
the rest of your lives
in this bathroom?

18:35.208 --> 18:37.959
Sounds like someone's
jealous of my tub.

18:37.959 --> 18:39.500
Don't you guys get it?

18:39.500 --> 18:41.709
Even if we could
stay alive in here,

18:41.709 --> 18:43.625
what kind of life would that be?

18:43.625 --> 18:45.583
Life is risky,

18:45.583 --> 18:48.083
but you have to get out there
and take chances anyway.

18:48.083 --> 18:49.375
Why should we listen to you?

18:49.375 --> 18:51.208
Well, maybe he's right.

18:51.208 --> 18:52.792
I mean, we can't
go through life

18:52.792 --> 18:54.417
without taking
any risks.

18:54.417 --> 18:55.917
Yeah, it's like
when Eddie Murphy

18:55.917 --> 18:57.291
picked up that
prostitute.

18:57.291 --> 18:58.542
But that
was a man.

18:58.542 --> 19:00.625
And he had
a marvelous time.

19:00.625 --> 19:04.125
I'm just asking you
to listen to me this once.

19:05.667 --> 19:07.041
Okay.

19:07.041 --> 19:09.000
But how are we gonna
fight a giant raccoon?

19:09.000 --> 19:10.417
We don't have
to fight it.

19:10.417 --> 19:12.208
All we have to do is
get out of the house.

19:12.208 --> 19:14.250
Quick, get the boards
off the door.

19:15.417 --> 19:16.625
We could really use
those hammers now,

19:16.625 --> 19:17.667
to pull these
nails out.

19:17.667 --> 19:18.625
Anybody see one?

19:21.917 --> 19:23.834
Quick, everybody
link arms.

19:23.834 --> 19:25.500
He'll think we're
a bigger animal.

19:25.500 --> 19:26.834
Hmm?

19:34.333 --> 19:35.917
Wait, Steve,
that's good.
Ow, ow!

19:35.917 --> 19:36.959
Ah!
Keep doing that!

19:36.959 --> 19:37.959
Keep doing what?!

19:37.959 --> 19:39.750
He thinks you're food.

19:39.750 --> 19:41.458
That'll distract him long enough
for us to get the boards off.

19:41.458 --> 19:42.834
Ow, ow!

19:42.834 --> 19:44.750
What if he bites
off my arm?

19:44.750 --> 19:45.959
That's the risk!

19:45.959 --> 19:47.667
That's the risk
we're all taking!

19:49.417 --> 19:51.583
Yah!

20:09.583 --> 20:12.667
He had a weirdly
good body.

20:15.041 --> 20:17.208
I guess we owe you
a "thanks," Roger.

20:17.208 --> 20:19.667
It seems like knowing
what the future holds

20:19.667 --> 20:21.792
can really keep you from
living in the present.

20:21.792 --> 20:24.083
Yeah, maybe
sometimes

20:24.083 --> 20:26.500
it's not a bad idea
to listen to Roger.

20:26.500 --> 20:27.709
Damn right!

20:27.709 --> 20:29.291
Now, let's cover
ourselves in honey

20:29.291 --> 20:31.458
and run through Old Man
McGuilicutty's bear farm.

20:31.458 --> 20:33.959
This is not one
of those times.

20:33.959 --> 20:36.458
Hey, can you drop me
off at the hospital?

20:38.792 --> 20:40.834
No, sorry, I don't
see that happening.

20:40.834 --> 20:42.125
I'm kidding.

20:42.125 --> 20:44.291
Come on,
let's go, kid.

20:45.583 --> 20:47.542
Hey, hey, why you
smacking your tushie?

20:47.542 --> 20:49.917
Why you smacking your tushie?
Why you doing that?

20:49.917 --> 20:52.542
Stop, stop! Stop it!

21:24.500 --> 21:26.583
Bye! Have a beautiful time.
