WEBVTT

00:19.480 --> 00:21.280
We have to be
more like the flounder.

00:21.280 --> 00:24.000
- Huh?
- Invisible, like the flounder.

00:24.680 --> 00:26.160
Flounders are ugly as fuck.

00:27.080 --> 00:29.360
<i>The flounder
doesn't win beauty pageants.</i>

00:29.880 --> 00:31.320
<i>But it doesn't need to.</i>

00:31.320 --> 00:34.480
<i>It's enough to be invisible,
and that's what they were.</i>

00:55.280 --> 00:58.080
Hey, hey! Oh, let's hide
all of them, Rafael.

00:59.000 --> 00:59.840
Come on.

01:05.760 --> 01:06.800
That's all.

01:24.640 --> 01:28.680
TURN OF THE TIDE

01:30.320 --> 01:32.760
<i>In an unprecedented police operation,</i>

01:32.760 --> 01:37.600
<i>more than 793 pounds of cocaine
were seized on the north of the island...</i>

01:37.600 --> 01:39.280
Come on! Fantastic police work!

01:39.280 --> 01:41.200
<i>...in Rabo de Peixe.</i>

01:41.200 --> 01:44.120
<i>The judiciary police claims
to have recovered</i>

01:44.120 --> 01:48.160
<i>all the cargo brought by Francesco Bonino,
known as "The Italian,"</i>

01:48.760 --> 01:51.040
<i>already captured by the police forces.</i>

01:51.720 --> 01:53.280
<i>We'll keep on following this case...</i>

01:53.280 --> 01:56.280
A toast to the brave officers
of Ponta Delgada.

01:56.280 --> 01:59.040
Let's go! Come on.

01:59.040 --> 02:00.600
A toast to Detective Frias!

02:00.600 --> 02:02.680
Without her decisive intervention,

02:02.680 --> 02:05.800
we would never have been able
to achieve this extraordinary feat, huh?

02:05.800 --> 02:08.280
Give a glass to Dr. Mainland
over there for her--

02:08.280 --> 02:10.440
Yeah, with pleasure. No problem<i>,</i> I got it.

02:10.440 --> 02:11.560
Congrats!

02:15.040 --> 02:17.160
Detective Frias, to your work.

02:18.120 --> 02:20.040
Call the prison. I want to talk to Bonino.

02:21.840 --> 02:22.680
This isn't over.

02:26.560 --> 02:29.000
Darling,
the boat broke down,

02:29.000 --> 02:30.880
and we ended up on an island.

02:33.400 --> 02:37.160
It's a cross between Sicily
and <i>Jurassic Park,</i> the movie.

02:37.160 --> 02:38.960
Remember all that vegetation?

02:39.480 --> 02:41.960
We'll bring the kids here.
They'll love it.

02:42.640 --> 02:44.360
No, Gianluca is fine.

02:47.480 --> 02:49.320
The cargo is in a safe place.

02:49.320 --> 02:52.440
Your face
is all over the newspapers.

02:52.440 --> 02:55.200
On TV, the Internet.
It's everywhere, Francesco.

02:56.040 --> 02:59.640
<i>We're sending someone
to get you out and recover the cargo.</i>

03:01.000 --> 03:02.760
- Who's coming?
<i>-</i> Monti.

03:04.720 --> 03:09.120
<i>Darling? Darling?
Hello? Hello, darling?</i>

03:13.600 --> 03:15.800
You're my sister
and I want you to be safe,

03:15.800 --> 03:16.960
but you talk too much.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.720
Your husband knows.
A captain always goes down with his ship.

03:31.400 --> 03:33.440
I'd rather
your children were orphaned

03:33.440 --> 03:35.360
than dishonored by their father.

03:47.040 --> 03:49.560
Hey, Italian.
What are you making us for lunch today?

03:49.560 --> 03:52.400
- Your <i>sorella.</i>
- Is that pasta or pizza?

03:53.080 --> 03:55.680
Same as last time. No one is coming.

03:56.880 --> 03:59.520
- Figures.
- We need to be patient.

04:00.680 --> 04:02.640
The ways of our Lord are mysterious.

04:02.640 --> 04:05.040
What's mysterious about this, Father?

04:05.040 --> 04:07.640
A drunk's a drunk.
He'll always be a drunk.

04:07.640 --> 04:11.520
Even an alcoholic is human, Carlinhos.
We can't abandon him.

04:15.920 --> 04:16.920
No offense, Father.

04:16.920 --> 04:20.680
They would certainly come here
and ask for help if you weren't so...

04:22.520 --> 04:25.920
so divine, so-- so goody two-shoes, right?

04:25.920 --> 04:28.360
Nobody wants to confess
his sins to a saint.

04:28.960 --> 04:31.040
It's just that I'm not a saint, Carlinhos.

04:33.120 --> 04:34.560
Today's the day, Sílvia.

04:35.520 --> 04:36.520
Yeah, you'll see.

04:36.520 --> 04:39.680
This year, the Holy Mother of the Legion
of Mary will end up at our place.

04:39.680 --> 04:43.440
- More like the legion of maniacs.
- Be respectful!

04:43.440 --> 04:45.920
We are Legionnaires of Mary,

04:45.920 --> 04:49.800
and the blessed Holy Mother will soon
find out where her next home will be.

04:49.800 --> 04:51.160
This year,

04:51.800 --> 04:56.320
your collected votes have decided
that our saint will go to...

04:56.880 --> 04:58.920
- Me!
- Slut!

04:58.920 --> 05:01.160
- Elvira Dutra!
- Motherfucker.

05:03.600 --> 05:07.240
I've already noticed that you never drink.
Not even the altar wine.

05:07.920 --> 05:09.680
It's the balance theory.

05:09.680 --> 05:12.720
If a man doesn't...

05:13.720 --> 05:15.000
...he has to drink.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.160
The Devil must get out somewhere, Father.

05:18.440 --> 05:19.680
- No, thank you.
- Come on.

05:23.640 --> 05:27.120
Perhaps I would be a good priest.
I also like to help others.

05:28.240 --> 05:30.440
At the seminary,
do they accept Isabellas like me?

05:30.440 --> 05:31.480
"Isabellas"?

05:32.360 --> 05:34.800
That's what the married men
call me.

05:34.800 --> 05:35.920
"Isabella."

05:36.400 --> 05:39.160
Is that wrong, Father, in the eyes of God?

05:39.840 --> 05:40.880
Of course not.

05:41.720 --> 05:42.880
God loves everybody equally.

05:43.800 --> 05:44.640
And I'm sorry...

05:46.280 --> 05:48.200
that someone would treat you that way.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.840
- No!
- I'm happy.

05:52.440 --> 05:54.600
I've never let anyone mock me. No.

05:56.480 --> 05:57.680
And I have the choir.

05:58.640 --> 06:01.320
One day, we'll get to go to the Vatican
and sing for the Pope.

06:03.800 --> 06:07.640
The Vatican is almost as small
as Rabo de Peixe.

06:08.720 --> 06:09.680
You serious?

06:10.720 --> 06:11.800
Mm-hmm.

06:15.760 --> 06:18.760
On the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel,
in the frescoes of the Last Judgment,

06:19.720 --> 06:21.680
there are men kissing each other.

06:24.520 --> 06:26.000
Let me know if you like this.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.480
But I'm warning you,
I'm not drunk enough.

07:24.800 --> 07:26.680
Your mother used to say

07:26.680 --> 07:29.360
that in the Azores,
the land burns from inside.

07:32.560 --> 07:34.360
This is where I asked her to marry me.

07:35.520 --> 07:38.800
What I wouldn't give to see this land
once more before I die.

07:59.560 --> 08:00.440
Come inside.

08:02.160 --> 08:03.120
It's getting late.

08:04.320 --> 08:06.400
It's so lovely here at this time of day.

08:17.440 --> 08:18.760
My beloved Fátima.

08:22.400 --> 08:24.800
Your mother would be 44 years old today.

08:31.960 --> 08:34.200
<i>They visited her grave
on that day every year.</i>

08:35.240 --> 08:38.520
<i>And every year, Eduardo made
the same promise to his mother.</i>

08:39.760 --> 08:42.960
<i>He would only go to America
after his father's eyes were healed.</i>

08:45.280 --> 08:46.560
<i>But after so long,</i>

08:47.320 --> 08:49.920
<i>my boy no longer knew
if that was a promise</i>

08:50.880 --> 08:52.480
<i>or a life sentence.</i>

08:54.960 --> 08:56.520
Look at this wild man!

08:57.560 --> 09:00.000
- Ah! Feliciano?
- And you must be the little guy.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.080
That's how your father
spoke of you in America.

09:02.080 --> 09:05.640
Feliciano Gomes,
of Feliciano's Canned Goods.

09:06.280 --> 09:07.400
Come on, let's have lunch.

09:08.160 --> 09:10.640
Tuna, squid, limpets, sardines.

09:11.320 --> 09:12.280
You name it.

09:12.280 --> 09:15.320
I'm the king of the ocean in a can, man!

09:15.320 --> 09:16.440
Get it?

09:16.440 --> 09:19.120
Kid, me and your father,
we went to America together.

09:19.120 --> 09:20.360
We started really small.

09:20.360 --> 09:22.000
Me selling <i>vaclinas</i>,

09:22.840 --> 09:24.200
and your father as a janitor.

09:25.120 --> 09:28.080
He cleaned houses.
Mostly bathrooms, right? Huh?

09:29.720 --> 09:32.160
Do you know what a <i>vaclina</i> is, kid?

09:33.520 --> 09:34.920
Vacuum cleaners.

09:35.520 --> 09:38.280
It was just a funny play on words,
you know what I mean?

09:39.040 --> 09:40.600
I'd never seen a foreigner

09:40.600 --> 09:43.400
adapt to American culture
as fast as your father.

09:43.920 --> 09:46.640
So much, that I wanted
to make him my business partner.

09:46.640 --> 09:48.080
But he didn't want to, no.

09:48.080 --> 09:51.080
He said, "That's nice, but Americans
won't be interested in canned food."

09:51.080 --> 09:54.200
"It's Portuguese that eat sardines."
And he was wrong.

09:54.200 --> 09:56.600
Mmm, if there's anything
that Americans admire,

09:56.600 --> 09:58.760
it's our seafood. Tuna, especially.

10:00.480 --> 10:02.760
And they pay straightaway. Right there!

10:05.920 --> 10:07.960
Oh, back in the days,

10:07.960 --> 10:10.480
me and your-- your father
and your uncle Joe,

10:11.600 --> 10:13.640
we were movie stars, celebrities.

10:21.160 --> 10:23.280
How long will it be until Arruda arrives?

10:24.320 --> 10:25.760
Don't you mean your father?

10:28.960 --> 10:30.080
Do you know, or...?

10:30.680 --> 10:31.880
Looks great, right?

10:33.280 --> 10:36.440
I worked very hard to have
the Virgin Mary here in my house.

10:40.040 --> 10:41.080
Speaking of Mary...

10:44.000 --> 10:46.480
Bloody Mary's with me.
Do you have anything?

10:47.720 --> 10:48.840
Hmm?

10:49.400 --> 10:51.840
- Aunt Flo is visiting.
- Aunt Flo?

10:53.200 --> 10:55.120
I got my period. Do you have a tampon?

10:55.960 --> 10:57.760
Ah! Why didn't you just say so?

11:14.840 --> 11:16.360
What a fucking country.

11:16.360 --> 11:18.320
You're not gonna wait
for the local hospital.

11:18.320 --> 11:21.440
You're coming with me to America,
and you'll get the surgery there.

11:21.440 --> 11:22.440
- No.
- I can afford it!

11:22.440 --> 11:24.040
- Feliciano!
- I told you I can afford it!

11:24.040 --> 11:26.840
You already paid for lunch,
and I'm grateful for it.

11:28.040 --> 11:29.920
But I don't want to owe you anything.

11:30.880 --> 11:33.520
Now, if you'll excuse me. Eduardo!

11:33.520 --> 11:35.840
- Yes, Dad. Right here.
- Help me inside.

11:36.360 --> 11:37.200
Here.

11:38.120 --> 11:38.960
There.

11:40.560 --> 11:41.400
Kid.

11:43.200 --> 11:44.280
Come over here.

11:50.680 --> 11:52.120
Go ahead. Take one.

11:54.640 --> 11:56.800
- The box, you knucklehead!
- Oh, yeah.

12:00.480 --> 12:02.040
Kid, look,

12:02.880 --> 12:05.880
your dad-- your dad is very proud,
and that's destroying him.

12:07.040 --> 12:08.400
I can help out. Hey?

12:09.400 --> 12:10.760
Don't be like your father.

12:11.360 --> 12:12.400
It won't end well.

12:42.120 --> 12:44.960
Don't let yourself be fooled
by Feliciano's offers.

12:44.960 --> 12:47.920
- It wasn't America that made him rich.
- What was it, then?

12:49.080 --> 12:50.920
- He was a con man.
- Of course.

12:50.920 --> 12:53.480
That's what America does to men.
It corrupts them.

12:54.280 --> 12:56.800
Why haven't you ever told me
you cleaned bathrooms in America?

12:57.960 --> 13:00.120
I was dirty on the outside,
but clean on the inside.

13:01.440 --> 13:03.400
I always slept with a clear conscience.

13:03.400 --> 13:05.760
That's one more reason
for you to accept Feliciano's help.

13:05.760 --> 13:07.760
He can afford to pay for your operation.

13:07.760 --> 13:10.960
If I were to die right now,
I could face God with dignity.

13:10.960 --> 13:13.320
Do you think that Feliciano
can say the same thing?

13:13.840 --> 13:14.920
Mom?

13:16.560 --> 13:18.120
- Come on!
- What is it?

13:19.320 --> 13:20.520
Come here.

13:22.320 --> 13:23.360
So...

13:25.160 --> 13:27.000
Jesus, Sílvia,
what is the saint doing here?

13:27.000 --> 13:29.120
Just tell me it doesn't look
great in there, huh?

13:29.120 --> 13:32.240
But it's been ten years
since I last touched alcohol.

13:32.240 --> 13:35.320
- How do you manage for mass?
- At mass, I pretend.

13:35.320 --> 13:37.400
But you can't tell that to anyone.

13:39.240 --> 13:40.960
After all, a priest is just a man.

13:45.120 --> 13:48.000
By the powers vested in me
by the holy Church,

13:48.760 --> 13:51.440
I forgive and absolve you
from all your sins.

14:06.600 --> 14:07.960
Business or pleasure?

14:08.840 --> 14:09.680
Fishing.

14:10.720 --> 14:12.600
Welcome to the Azores, Mr. Monti.

14:29.040 --> 14:30.920
This is the last thing I need!

14:33.240 --> 14:35.680
- I'm really high right now, my God!
- This is a big one.

14:35.680 --> 14:37.520
Everything's moving around!

14:43.040 --> 14:45.880
<i>Jesus of Nazareth,
the son of God,</i>

14:46.400 --> 14:48.720
<i>he suffered on the cross
for a couple of hours,</i>

14:48.720 --> 14:51.600
<i>and afterwards, brought
peace and love for all eternity.</i>

14:51.600 --> 14:53.480
<i>In the Azores, there's no rest.</i>

14:54.080 --> 14:55.200
<i>This is purgatory.</i>

15:06.000 --> 15:06.840
Carlos...

15:29.240 --> 15:31.880
God will
surely punish us for this!

15:31.880 --> 15:32.960
Holy shit.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.440
Can you see it now?

15:37.080 --> 15:38.360
Life is temporary.

15:39.640 --> 15:41.120
We're just passing through.

16:05.320 --> 16:06.800
You're only making it worse.

16:07.880 --> 16:09.600
Well, I said I was good
at arts and crafts,

16:09.600 --> 16:11.520
but I don't do miracles.
It's almost a miracle.

16:11.520 --> 16:13.680
We're gonna be excommunicated for sure.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.640
- Sílvia!
- Huh?

16:26.640 --> 16:28.560
Get the door.

16:37.520 --> 16:40.640
Are you all right?
How are you? You all right? Huh?

16:41.160 --> 16:43.080
What happened to you? Huh?

16:48.200 --> 16:50.120
No, this can't happen. It can't.

16:51.560 --> 16:52.480
Of course.

16:53.600 --> 16:56.000
In this place,
nothing good ever happens, right?

16:56.800 --> 16:58.360
Isn't that what you always say?

17:01.440 --> 17:02.600
Who's that?

17:03.680 --> 17:04.960
Oh. What's up?

17:05.720 --> 17:08.240
Well, I came to tell you
that flounder season is over.

17:09.800 --> 17:12.800
- We're getting back into business.
- My man! Finally!

17:14.640 --> 17:15.840
Life is temporary.

17:17.200 --> 17:18.360
We're just passing through.

17:33.880 --> 17:36.400
<i>Earthquakes are not
just the earth shaking.</i>

17:37.400 --> 17:39.720
<i>They also shake the core of who we are.</i>

17:39.720 --> 17:42.200
<i>We feel our impotence, our fragility,</i>

17:42.720 --> 17:43.600
<i>our shame.</i>

17:44.120 --> 17:45.400
<i>Our anger.</i>

18:07.320 --> 18:08.840
Hello? Zinha.

18:10.040 --> 18:11.720
Where's the freaking saint?

18:19.600 --> 18:21.800
I'm so glad you're driving
the car, my girl.

18:21.800 --> 18:25.200
This fucking sciatica
is getting on my nerves, I swear.

18:25.200 --> 18:27.880
The sciatica <i>is</i> a nerve.

18:27.880 --> 18:29.000
Mmm.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.360
Elvira's the one getting on your nerves.

18:33.320 --> 18:34.840
I'm only doing this to keep my mom

18:34.840 --> 18:37.120
from getting into trouble
with those religious bigots.

18:37.800 --> 18:39.920
But I'm your father. Can I help?

18:39.920 --> 18:41.240
Hmm?

18:41.840 --> 18:42.800
"I'm your father."

18:43.400 --> 18:45.200
When did you start, Father? Today?

18:45.200 --> 18:47.000
Oh, oh! Zinha.

18:48.760 --> 18:50.280
There's no Zinha anymore.

18:50.840 --> 18:51.840
My name is Sílvia.

18:53.120 --> 18:56.080
The last birthday you spent with me,
I was... seven years old?

18:56.080 --> 18:59.120
Yeah, I remember.
Took you to the movies to see, you know,

18:59.120 --> 19:01.040
that cartoon with the deer.
What is it called?

19:01.040 --> 19:03.640
-<i>Bambi.</i>
- Yeah, <i>Bambi.</i> Exactly, <i>Ba-- Bambi.</i>

19:03.640 --> 19:05.480
- And then you gave me a hunting gun.
- Mm-hmm.

19:05.480 --> 19:07.240
And you took me rabbit hunting.

19:07.240 --> 19:10.240
- Nice childhood memory.
- I know what I am and what I'm not.

19:10.240 --> 19:11.160
All right?

19:12.200 --> 19:14.480
And I wasn't the world's best father.

19:15.080 --> 19:18.480
But I think that I still have time
to get to know you better.

19:18.480 --> 19:19.440
I'm serious.

19:19.440 --> 19:21.560
For example, I'd like to know
what food you like,

19:21.560 --> 19:24.120
and if you keep dyeing your hair
pink like that often,

19:24.120 --> 19:26.400
what kind of music you like.

19:26.400 --> 19:28.200
- Really?
- Yeah.

19:28.200 --> 19:30.120
- Do you really want to know?
- Mm-hmm.

19:30.120 --> 19:31.200
All right, then.

19:33.280 --> 19:34.320
I like sex.

19:34.320 --> 19:35.880
A lot.

19:37.040 --> 19:39.760
But here, no one knows
how to go down on a girl the right way.

19:45.960 --> 19:48.800
That means that if you sum
the squares on the legs, you get...

19:49.400 --> 19:51.560
The hypotenuse. Way to go!

19:52.600 --> 19:55.280
Which is the diagonal line
of the triangle. We've seen that.

19:55.960 --> 19:59.880
Exactly, but you have to do the homework
so that you don't fall behind, right?

20:00.520 --> 20:03.160
Remember, only on the right triangles.

20:04.320 --> 20:06.600
Look, Sara, I'm sorry.
We have to pick this up tomorrow.

20:07.280 --> 20:08.880
Okay? Is that okay?

20:11.520 --> 20:14.560
All righty, gotta go.
Okay, no problem. Bye.

20:17.920 --> 20:18.800
Let's go.

20:20.040 --> 20:22.840
You were right.
Your daughter's horrible at geometry.

20:23.360 --> 20:25.200
I'm counting on you
to change that, all right?

20:26.960 --> 20:30.400
Hey, excuse me? Well, how are things?

20:30.400 --> 20:31.720
- Uh-oh!
- Agostinho!

20:31.720 --> 20:34.600
- Fuck, how are you?
- So good to see you.

20:34.600 --> 20:37.680
Uh, back in the days,
this friend of mine was known as Foamy.

20:37.680 --> 20:40.960
He always had that little white crust
on the corner of his mouth.

20:40.960 --> 20:43.160
- We have here my beautiful daughter.
- Hello.

20:43.160 --> 20:45.200
- The hot-shot of the island.
- How's things?

20:45.200 --> 20:46.920
Tell these guys how we met each other.

20:46.920 --> 20:50.560
Soldiers in arms. Great years.
But if this fucker hadn't helped me,

20:50.560 --> 20:52.560
I'd still be trying
to finish basic training.

20:52.560 --> 20:53.800
Fucking right!

20:53.800 --> 20:56.080
- Ah, what've you got there?
- Just look at it.

20:56.080 --> 20:59.240
- Look at this! They broke her head off.
- Totally fucked up her hands.

20:59.240 --> 21:00.680
Can you... Yeah.

21:00.680 --> 21:02.760
Check that out.
They destroyed our saint.

21:02.760 --> 21:04.480
She's all fucked up. No hands.

21:04.480 --> 21:06.760
Totally fucked up her head. Look here.

21:06.760 --> 21:08.760
- Poor Virgin Mary.
- She's all broken up.

21:08.760 --> 21:12.080
- Look here. Look here at the bottom part.
- Who does this to a saint, man?

21:12.600 --> 21:14.440
I won't be able to save it. Wait.

21:15.120 --> 21:15.960
Wait a second.

21:23.920 --> 21:24.920
There you go.

21:26.400 --> 21:27.320
A miracle.

21:28.880 --> 21:32.280
So much bullshit about the saint,
and after all that...

21:32.280 --> 21:35.520
My girl... "Thank you, Dad."
Show some manners?

21:36.120 --> 21:37.920
Thanks a lot... old man.

21:42.920 --> 21:44.440
Rafael, what's up, fucker?

21:45.080 --> 21:46.440
Come on, pick this shit up.

21:46.440 --> 21:49.200
- Agostinho!
- Ah, any time, brother.

21:50.240 --> 21:52.080
- Good to see you.
- Let's go.

21:54.600 --> 21:56.920
- The boats are almost ready.
- Come on, then.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.520
Did you feel the earthquake?

22:05.120 --> 22:06.000
<i>I did.</i>

22:08.760 --> 22:10.760
Don't stop.
Don't stop! Don't stop--

22:14.800 --> 22:15.760
Seriously?

22:17.640 --> 22:19.480
Four-point-two on the Richter scale.

22:21.120 --> 22:22.240
It was a weak one.

22:25.200 --> 22:26.040
You're right.

22:26.920 --> 22:27.880
It was weak.

22:40.760 --> 22:42.360
MARITIME POLICE

22:57.600 --> 22:59.040
Speak, man. Speak, come on.

23:02.960 --> 23:04.560
Bruna, I want to apologize.

23:04.560 --> 23:05.720
Wait a second.

23:05.720 --> 23:09.240
Uh...
It's making me a bit uncomfortable.

23:10.120 --> 23:11.000
What's wrong?

23:11.720 --> 23:14.480
You standing there like that,
with the little bag in your hand.

23:14.480 --> 23:16.760
You seem like <i>The Crying Boy</i> painting.

23:16.760 --> 23:17.760
Just sit down.

23:19.680 --> 23:22.120
Want some milk?
Get that cat off your tongue.

23:22.720 --> 23:23.560
Huh?

23:24.560 --> 23:26.360
- Hmm?
- Stop it.

23:27.280 --> 23:28.800
Well, um...

23:30.240 --> 23:32.600
- I, um-- What I want to tell you is--
- Hold on.

23:38.120 --> 23:39.000
Now you can go.

23:43.080 --> 23:44.280
Bruna, I owe you an apology.

23:47.720 --> 23:48.560
Asshole!

23:51.000 --> 23:51.840
Fuck!

23:52.480 --> 23:55.760
Imagine being in a house full of cops
with two kilos of cocaine in a backpack.

23:55.760 --> 23:58.920
You must have shit
your little fucking panties.

23:58.920 --> 24:02.120
If you hadn't called Sílvia to tell her
the police were en route to Rabo de Peixe,

24:02.120 --> 24:04.040
I can guarantee you
I'd be locked up right now.

24:04.040 --> 24:06.560
Right now, you'd be picking meat soaps
with your ass cheeks

24:06.560 --> 24:09.040
at the correctional facility
at Ponta Delgada, like this,

24:09.040 --> 24:10.080
with your little ass.

24:10.080 --> 24:13.280
And I wouldn't have the chance to show you
how grateful I am for what you did.

24:13.280 --> 24:15.480
That's pretty cool. That's for me.

24:15.480 --> 24:17.960
Clean steal! Two for two!
I get the gold medal!

24:17.960 --> 24:19.360
Can't stop, won't stop.

24:23.920 --> 24:26.280
Go at it.

24:27.960 --> 24:31.960
This coke is the best present
anyone's ever given me in my whole life.

24:35.200 --> 24:37.560
Besides the bicycle with training wheels
when I was five.

24:42.440 --> 24:43.440
Peace and love?

24:44.080 --> 24:46.240
Peace and love.

24:51.440 --> 24:53.440
Gimme a cigarette.

24:54.480 --> 24:57.600
What's up? Come! What's the problem?

24:57.600 --> 24:59.720
Come to the Godfather. Come.

25:02.240 --> 25:03.160
It's all over now.

25:03.880 --> 25:07.040
It's all over now. Huh? Yes, it is.

25:07.040 --> 25:09.480
We're good pals now, huh? Aren't we?

25:10.360 --> 25:12.640
Hmm? You can cut the crap, all right?

25:12.640 --> 25:15.800
You can stop acting
like the Mahatma Gandhi of cocaine

25:15.800 --> 25:18.960
and say, once and for all,
why you came here. Hmm?

25:20.040 --> 25:21.440
It's because I need a buyer.

25:29.400 --> 25:33.120
Detective, you know, most outsiders
feel stuck here on the island.

25:33.640 --> 25:35.640
They perceive the ocean as a wall.

25:35.640 --> 25:37.960
But for us, it's funny,
it's exactly the opposite.

25:38.600 --> 25:39.680
It's an open door.

25:41.240 --> 25:42.360
Don't worry about it.

25:43.080 --> 25:45.680
I feel freer in the Azores than in Lisbon.

25:58.800 --> 26:00.880
Is this
where you hid the coke?

26:02.160 --> 26:04.240
I never said I hid the drugs.

26:04.240 --> 26:06.760
I said
I saw people hide them here.

26:07.360 --> 26:10.960
That's two different things.
Maybe we misunderstood each other.

26:11.680 --> 26:15.440
Detective,
maybe your Italian isn't all that great.

26:15.440 --> 26:16.400
Eh?

26:17.560 --> 26:21.480
It's good enough for me
to realize I've been taken for a ride.

26:27.400 --> 26:30.520
The five steps of the process are cutting...

26:31.520 --> 26:33.800
...weighing, packaging,

26:33.800 --> 26:35.920
hiding, and transporting.

26:35.920 --> 26:37.040
Watch it!

26:37.560 --> 26:39.480
As for hiding, we've seen it all, right?

26:40.800 --> 26:43.080
The movies have tons of examples.

26:43.080 --> 26:47.200
I saw this movie
where they hid coke up their asses, man.

26:47.200 --> 26:48.400
But I won't do that.

26:48.400 --> 26:50.520
I can put stuff up your asses,
but only for fun.

26:50.520 --> 26:52.920
Pay attention, come on.

26:52.920 --> 26:54.400
Fucking pay attention!

26:54.400 --> 26:57.200
Ian's buyer needs the drugs
on the mainland.

26:58.160 --> 27:01.280
He wants it sent in a container, by boat.

27:01.280 --> 27:02.200
So, question...

27:03.120 --> 27:06.920
How do we safely smuggle five kilos
of cocaine to the mainland?

27:08.280 --> 27:09.120
Huh?

27:32.800 --> 27:35.680
This Italian is slicker than a swordfish.

27:35.680 --> 27:39.200
In the interrogations, he confessed
that he only had half a ton in the boat.

27:39.200 --> 27:41.760
Then we found 600-ish pounds more
in the raid.

27:42.480 --> 27:44.200
And now he says the drugs aren't even his.

27:44.200 --> 27:46.800
Bonino's lies reveal more
than what he hides.

27:48.480 --> 27:50.560
He knows damn well we have evidence.

27:51.440 --> 27:53.480
- But someone told him to shut up.
- Who?

27:54.800 --> 27:56.160
- Guess.
- Uh...

27:56.160 --> 27:57.240
Hmm.

27:57.240 --> 27:59.400
The real owners of the drugs, Francisco.

28:00.600 --> 28:02.560
There's a lot of coke
somewhere on this island,

28:02.560 --> 28:04.240
and the Italians will come for it.

29:14.720 --> 29:16.080
It's here. Stop, stop!

30:18.120 --> 30:20.720
One man's trash
is another man's treasure.

30:48.480 --> 30:49.840
There's another box in the pickup.

30:49.840 --> 30:51.320
- Come on, man!
- Go get it, chop-chop.

30:51.320 --> 30:54.080
- Carlinhos, there's another box. Get it.
- I'm busy here! Fine. Jesus!

30:54.080 --> 30:56.160
Let's see here.
The cargo has to go to Ian today.

30:56.840 --> 30:58.840
Ah!

30:58.840 --> 31:00.640
It's a thing of beauty, right?

31:00.640 --> 31:02.840
Ah!

31:02.840 --> 31:04.880
What are you looking for,
the secrets of Fatima?

31:06.600 --> 31:08.400
- She's pretty.
- Here.

31:08.400 --> 31:09.960
- Careful.
- Eduardo.

31:09.960 --> 31:12.200
- Huh?
- Eduardo, we've got company, man.

31:12.200 --> 31:15.960
Hey! Good morning, hey.

31:16.560 --> 31:18.480
Hey!

31:19.160 --> 31:21.520
Here you are, Wednesday. How are you?

31:21.520 --> 31:23.560
Also known as "Neither fucks nor leaves."

31:25.720 --> 31:27.520
- So, hot shot, all fine?
- I'm good.

31:27.520 --> 31:29.280
Hey, hey, hey.

31:29.280 --> 31:32.880
My lovely daughter, Zinha, Zinha.

31:34.520 --> 31:35.520
My dear.

31:37.280 --> 31:40.640
Today, I woke up with a fucking urge
to go to the movies, hmm?

31:40.640 --> 31:43.520
But now, movies are only
on videos and tape.

31:44.160 --> 31:46.640
There used to be a movie theater
in Rabo de Peixe,

31:46.640 --> 31:48.760
and I went once a week or so.

31:48.760 --> 31:50.000
Do you remember, Zinha?

31:50.000 --> 31:53.040
And the first time that you saw <i>Bambi,</i>
it was there.

31:53.040 --> 31:56.080
Hmm. That shit had already begun.
A few minutes later...

31:56.080 --> 31:58.160
Rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat!

31:59.440 --> 32:01.560
Bambi's mother dies. They killed her.

32:01.560 --> 32:03.200
You cried through the whole movie.

32:06.160 --> 32:08.480
Eh, you know what my favorite movie is?

32:10.640 --> 32:12.920
<i>Dirty Harry.</i>

32:12.920 --> 32:16.040
I've always liked the guys
who take the law into their own hands.

32:16.040 --> 32:18.040
Hey, girl. Do you have that one, hmm?

32:19.400 --> 32:20.440
Go get it.

32:21.000 --> 32:22.600
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm.

32:29.440 --> 32:30.360
Mm-hmm.

32:31.160 --> 32:33.320
That's it. What was the name
of the detective?

32:33.320 --> 32:35.640
- Who was the detective? It was--
- Harry Callahan.

32:35.640 --> 32:37.000
- What?
- It was Harry Callahan.

32:37.000 --> 32:39.480
You can't help it,
can you, idiot?

32:39.480 --> 32:41.800
You think you're smarter
than everyone else.

32:41.800 --> 32:42.720
That's because he is.

32:42.720 --> 32:44.880
Little pansy, shut the fuck up!
I'm not talking to you!

32:44.880 --> 32:46.520
That pansy can beat the crap out of you!

32:46.520 --> 32:48.240
- Hey, have you no fucking shame?
- Hey, hey!

32:48.240 --> 32:49.280
Shh!

32:49.920 --> 32:51.600
Don't make a move.

32:51.600 --> 32:56.040
Maybe today, I'm more in the mood
for a movie with a happy ending.

32:56.040 --> 32:58.040
Let him go. Shh.

32:58.040 --> 33:00.960
The world is already violent enough,
isn't it?

33:02.240 --> 33:05.120
Example, here. Our friend...

33:06.320 --> 33:10.160
he got careless and he fell
into one of those furnace holes.

33:10.800 --> 33:13.440
As if that wasn't enough,
now in Rabo de Peixe,

33:13.440 --> 33:15.720
they call him Zé <i>do</i> Chicken!

33:19.240 --> 33:21.800
Because he's really well boiled.
All we have to do is shred him up,

33:21.800 --> 33:23.800
put him in a chicken soufflé!

33:26.160 --> 33:29.280
But there are happy endings,
right, Zé? Aren't there?

33:48.920 --> 33:50.240
When I was a kid,

33:51.680 --> 33:53.520
there was a stray dog there on the street

33:53.520 --> 33:55.800
that, every night,
would saunter into our yard

33:55.800 --> 33:57.960
to try and rip apart
one of our poor chickens.

33:57.960 --> 34:00.440
My father poisoned
the little shit three times,

34:00.440 --> 34:03.160
but the motherfucking dog
survived three times.

34:03.160 --> 34:05.280
So one day,
we opened the door to it and we fed it.

34:05.280 --> 34:07.600
The fucker lived with us for 12 years.

34:08.680 --> 34:12.200
I never saw an animal that grateful.

34:13.880 --> 34:15.080
That's why I say,

34:15.080 --> 34:17.400
man, I mean, getting out
of a furnace hole alive?

34:17.400 --> 34:19.760
Fuck this shit, that's fucking crazy, huh?

34:19.760 --> 34:21.160
Isn't it, huh?

34:21.160 --> 34:22.840
It wasn't his time to go, huh?

34:23.360 --> 34:25.720
And who am I to go against God's will?

34:26.280 --> 34:29.120
- Amen.
- And the Holy Spirit.

34:30.440 --> 34:31.760
You all fucking know me.

34:31.760 --> 34:34.280
You know that when someone is in trouble,

34:34.280 --> 34:36.360
I'm the guy who doesn't walk away.

34:37.720 --> 34:39.080
I don't fucking walk away.

34:39.080 --> 34:42.200
If it wasn't for this fucking sciatica...
Shit, I can barely stand.

34:42.200 --> 34:44.400
I can't drive. You know, I need a driver.

34:44.400 --> 34:46.960
If it wasn't for me, Zé <i>do</i> Chicken
wouldn't be working.

34:48.480 --> 34:49.880
Eh?

34:52.320 --> 34:55.160
Oh! Look it, look it, look it, look it.

34:56.560 --> 34:58.600
What were you thinking,
you fucking morons?

34:59.200 --> 35:02.760
That Agostinho wouldn't tell me
that the blow was in the saints, hey?

35:02.760 --> 35:03.680
Huh? You fucking--

35:03.680 --> 35:06.000
- Mr. Arruda, I swear on my life--
- Don't "Mr. Arruda" me!

35:06.000 --> 35:07.960
- What are you doing?
- Shut the fuck up!

35:07.960 --> 35:10.080
Where's the fucking blow?
Where's the fucking blow?

35:10.080 --> 35:12.160
- There's no more.
- You're lying! Where's the cocaine?

35:12.160 --> 35:14.760
- Leave him alone! Let him go!
- Damn, where's the fucking cocaine?

35:14.760 --> 35:16.760
- I know where the coke is.
- Where is it, daughter?

35:16.760 --> 35:17.920
- Let him go!
- Come on.

35:17.920 --> 35:20.120
- Just fucking tell me where it is.
- You okay, brother?

35:21.520 --> 35:24.280
Motherfucker!
Let go of me, you fucker.

35:26.480 --> 35:28.680
Fuck off!

35:29.880 --> 35:31.040
"This summer,

35:31.720 --> 35:34.080

35:49.480 --> 35:52.120
Can you not say shit like that
in front of my daughter, you moron?

35:52.120 --> 35:54.440
Sorry. I'm sorry, Sílvia.

35:54.440 --> 35:56.280
There's no more. That's all of it.

36:08.520 --> 36:10.400
- That's all?
- That's all. Boss, that's all.

36:10.400 --> 36:12.880
- I swear to you by our lord--
- No one asked you, dickhead.

36:12.880 --> 36:14.000
So shut up, all right?

36:15.960 --> 36:19.880
Wednesday... if I find out
that you're hiding something from me,

36:19.880 --> 36:21.720
you'll be the next up to boil in the oven.

36:21.720 --> 36:22.680
Hmm.

36:23.480 --> 36:25.040
- Are you hiding something from me?
- No.

36:25.040 --> 36:26.280
- Are you lying to me?
- I'm not.

36:26.280 --> 36:27.720
- Do you have more cocaine?
- No more.

36:27.720 --> 36:29.280
There's no more, Mr. Arruda, I swear.

36:30.320 --> 36:31.280
There's no more.

36:32.960 --> 36:34.120
Then what the fuck is this?

36:34.800 --> 36:36.360
Hmm? What?

36:37.120 --> 36:37.960
Huh?

36:42.960 --> 36:44.840
Bye, bitches!

36:48.640 --> 36:50.240
Motherfuckin' asshole.

37:44.680 --> 37:46.240
<i>My boy Eduardo knew</i>

37:46.240 --> 37:49.120
<i>that every now and then,
we'd have to pretend to be lambs</i>

37:49.120 --> 37:52.560
<i>so that later, we can be the wolves
we're meant to be.</i>

38:02.040 --> 38:03.120
Hey, Ma.

38:06.520 --> 38:08.120
Ma, the priest?

38:09.320 --> 38:11.640
I don't know. He hasn't shown up yet,
honey. I don't know.

38:23.600 --> 38:25.400
Father? Father!

38:26.080 --> 38:27.840
Father? Father, wake up!

38:27.840 --> 38:29.920
Father, everybody's waiting
for you. Father!

38:29.920 --> 38:33.240
<i>After so many years
without falling into temptation,</i>

38:33.240 --> 38:37.120
<i>the priest started drinking again
to relieve the guilt.</i>

38:38.880 --> 38:42.240
<i>We all know
the Devil must come out somehow.</i>

38:43.120 --> 38:45.160
Carlos, wait...

38:45.760 --> 38:48.480
- No. No, Carlos.
<i>-</i> Just a bit, snort it.

38:48.480 --> 38:49.600
Go on.

38:54.720 --> 38:56.000
Okay. One more.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.760
Hold on, just one more.

38:58.760 --> 39:00.920
Just one more.

39:06.120 --> 39:08.560
Father will be there in a second.

39:15.760 --> 39:16.840
Let's go.

39:17.920 --> 39:20.640
Come on, let's get you
on your feet, Father.

39:21.560 --> 39:22.400
Come on.

39:27.600 --> 39:30.760
What I've done is shameful
in the eyes of the lord.

39:31.840 --> 39:33.800
Father, please. Father, please look at me.

39:35.080 --> 39:36.400
On the day of the earthquake,

39:36.400 --> 39:39.560
it was you who told me
that no human being should be abandoned.

39:39.560 --> 39:40.960
God does not abandon.

39:41.480 --> 39:44.080
But you also can't abandon
these people who are waiting for you

39:44.080 --> 39:45.360
and who need your assistance.

39:45.360 --> 39:47.240
They really need you, Father.

39:52.280 --> 39:53.520
May God forgive me.

39:57.840 --> 40:00.080
Give me a little more.

40:00.680 --> 40:01.680
Okay, just one more.

40:43.640 --> 40:44.720
Brethren,

40:46.600 --> 40:49.640
to honorably celebrate the Holy Mysteries,

40:49.640 --> 40:53.360
let us acknowledge
that--that we are all-- all sinners.

40:59.360 --> 41:02.240
I confess to Almighty God...

41:10.000 --> 41:12.400
...and to you, brethren, and to you,

41:13.440 --> 41:14.800
that I have often sinned

41:15.840 --> 41:17.360
in many of my thoughts

41:17.360 --> 41:20.360
and words, as well,
in actions and omissions.

41:22.560 --> 41:24.640
By my own guilt, my soul...

41:25.880 --> 41:27.840
by my enormous...

41:29.760 --> 41:30.600
guilt, my--

41:59.920 --> 42:00.840
Eduardo!

42:03.640 --> 42:04.480
What?

42:06.080 --> 42:08.520
While we're distracted buying
all this shit we don't need,

42:08.520 --> 42:10.480
- those in power do whatever they want.
- Rafael.

42:10.480 --> 42:12.760
- You're a nut job, Eduardo.
- I know what I'm saying.

42:12.760 --> 42:14.840
- It's just a movie.
-<i>The Matrix</i> isn't just a movie.

42:15.800 --> 42:18.080
Eduardo! The priest started bleeding
from his nose

42:18.080 --> 42:19.520
and passed out during mass!

42:23.720 --> 42:24.800
Fucking hell.

43:13.560 --> 43:14.560
Tony Montana.

43:15.160 --> 43:16.000
Huh?

43:17.840 --> 43:19.720
Tony Montana, from <i>Scarface.</i>

43:20.920 --> 43:24.240
Only went down when he started thinking
with his nose instead of his head.

43:26.240 --> 43:27.160
What now?

43:29.960 --> 43:31.240
We use our heads.
