01:00.333 --> 01:03.467
_

01:09.276 --> 01:11.444
Kion!

01:11.478 --> 01:14.180
How are we supposed to
chase off the hyenas?

01:14.214 --> 01:16.415
We can't even see them
with all this dust.

01:16.450 --> 01:19.151
I'm sure that's part of
Janja's plan, Fuli.

01:19.186 --> 01:21.387
Kion! Fuli! Look out!

01:21.421 --> 01:23.456
- Kabisa!
- Whoa!

01:23.490 --> 01:25.124
Good eyes, Ono!

01:25.158 --> 01:27.159
Keep 'em peeled for Janja
and his clan!

01:27.194 --> 01:29.495
Peeled eyes? Ew.

01:35.235 --> 01:36.435
Hapana!

01:36.470 --> 01:39.438
Bunga, Beshte!
I see Cheezi and Chungu!

01:39.473 --> 01:41.207
They're behind that bush!

01:41.241 --> 01:42.508
Let's get 'em, Beshte.

01:44.344 --> 01:46.445
Twende kiboko!

01:48.348 --> 01:50.216
Zuka Zama!

01:50.250 --> 01:52.318
That takes care
of those two.

01:57.090 --> 01:58.491
Ono! Look for Janja!

01:59.559 --> 02:01.093
We chase him off,

02:01.128 --> 02:03.195
the rest of the hyenas
will go, too!

02:03.230 --> 02:04.396
Affirmative!

02:09.035 --> 02:11.270
Gotcha now, lion cub.

02:14.107 --> 02:15.441
Kion! Behind you!

02:15.475 --> 02:17.042
Look out!

02:18.411 --> 02:20.279
Janja!

02:20.313 --> 02:24.383
I told you to stay out
of the Pride Lands!

02:24.417 --> 02:27.219
Did you?
I must'a forgot!

02:27.254 --> 02:29.088
Kion! Incoming!

02:29.122 --> 02:30.322
See ya, hyena.

02:36.129 --> 02:37.196
I've had enough.

02:38.265 --> 02:40.366
Come on, fellows. Let's go!

02:40.400 --> 02:43.102
But, Janja!
What about the plan?

02:43.136 --> 02:44.203
Yeah.

02:44.237 --> 02:47.106
The dust is still
making things hard to see.

02:47.140 --> 02:48.507
Yeah, yeah. Dust don't matter

02:48.542 --> 02:51.177
when the Lion Guard
has eyes in the sky.

02:51.211 --> 02:52.311
Now move it!

02:53.346 --> 02:55.281
That's right!
Get outta here!

02:55.315 --> 02:58.117
I'm going. I'm going!

02:58.151 --> 02:59.285
Keep going, Janja!

02:59.319 --> 03:01.253
All the way back
to the Outlands!

03:01.288 --> 03:03.122
And stay out!

03:03.156 --> 03:04.390
Nice job, everyone.

03:04.424 --> 03:08.160
Follow them, Ono. Make sure
they leave the Pride Lands.

03:08.195 --> 03:09.995
You got it, Kion.

03:11.398 --> 03:14.200
You heard him! Keep going!

03:15.202 --> 03:17.136
Ow! My eye!

03:17.170 --> 03:19.371
- I'm hit!
- Oh, no.

03:19.406 --> 03:22.308
Ono!

03:25.045 --> 03:27.112
Bird down! Bird down!

03:30.217 --> 03:32.384
He's over here!

03:32.419 --> 03:35.287
Don't worry, Ono.
We'll get you to Rafiki.

03:35.322 --> 03:36.355
He'll know what to do.

03:40.060 --> 03:41.093
Mmm-hmm.

03:45.398 --> 03:47.199
- Rafiki!
- Huh?

03:47.234 --> 03:49.468
We need you, Rafiki!
Ono's hurt!

03:49.502 --> 03:51.303
Easy there, Ono.

03:51.338 --> 03:53.405
Ow, my eye.

03:53.440 --> 03:55.241
Mmmm, yes.

03:55.275 --> 03:58.043
I see you cannot see.

03:58.078 --> 04:02.147
Ha-ha! Dirt in the eye!
Not as bad as it looks.

04:04.384 --> 04:06.018
Now, down here! Quick!

04:09.356 --> 04:11.423
Okay, it's okay.
Just a moment.

04:12.259 --> 04:14.360
And a little space?

04:18.098 --> 04:19.365
Mmm.

04:19.399 --> 04:22.334
Yes... just enough.

04:22.369 --> 04:25.271
Now, hold still, Ono.

04:25.305 --> 04:28.407
And... Ah-ha! Yes!

04:28.441 --> 04:32.077
- There.
- How's it look?

04:33.079 --> 04:35.214
- Hmm.
- Well...

04:35.248 --> 04:38.183
Oh, is it that bad?

04:38.218 --> 04:40.019
No, no. Not at all.

04:40.053 --> 04:42.121
I like it.
Green is your color.

04:42.155 --> 04:45.090
Yeah, yeah, yeah! It totally
brings out your eyes!

04:45.125 --> 04:47.059
- Bunga.
- Did I say your eyes?

04:47.093 --> 04:48.360
I mean it brings out your one eye.

04:48.395 --> 04:50.616
The one you've got left.
I mean, I know

04:50.617 --> 04:52.464
the other one's still there,
but you can't see it.

04:52.499 --> 04:55.501
- I mean, uh...
- Oh, forget it.

04:55.535 --> 04:57.403
Well, I think it's Poa.

04:57.437 --> 05:01.206
And if I ever get dirt in my
eye, I want one just like it.

05:01.241 --> 05:03.042
Yeah. Me, too.

05:03.076 --> 05:05.010
So, am I gonna be okay?

05:05.045 --> 05:07.413
Yes, yes.
Your eye will be fine.

05:07.447 --> 05:10.049
Just wear this eye patch
for three days.

05:10.083 --> 05:13.152
- And no craziness.
- Three days?

05:13.186 --> 05:16.055
- No craziness?
- Don't worry, Ono.

05:16.089 --> 05:18.457
The Guard can get by for
a couple days without you.

05:18.491 --> 05:20.225
You need
to rest and get better.

05:20.260 --> 05:22.061
But I can still help the Guard.

05:22.095 --> 05:24.163
Besides, I can see just fine.

05:25.498 --> 05:30.169
- Is that wall new?
- No, but those paintings are.

05:31.438 --> 05:34.173
Yes, yes.
Every Lion Guard appears

05:34.207 --> 05:35.441
on the walls of the lair.

05:35.475 --> 05:39.078
So everyone remembers
who they are.

05:39.112 --> 05:43.148
Today, I must add all of you
to the story of the Lion Guard.

05:43.183 --> 05:44.416
Poa!

05:44.451 --> 05:47.252
So that's Kion.
And there's Fuli.

05:47.287 --> 05:48.229
And that's me!

05:48.230 --> 05:51.056
That's me. That's me.
That's me. That's me!

05:51.091 --> 05:52.324
Amazing.

05:52.359 --> 05:55.194
Amazing to you.
To me? Not so much.

05:55.228 --> 05:59.064
But, they do say that art is
in the eye of the beholder.

05:59.099 --> 06:02.101
- You got what in your eye?
- "Eye of the beholder."

06:02.135 --> 06:05.337
It means everyone has their
own opinion of what's good.

06:05.372 --> 06:08.007
Yes. And this painting,

06:08.041 --> 06:12.077
it does not quite have the
spirit of your Lion Guard.

06:12.112 --> 06:13.178
What do you think, Ono?

06:13.213 --> 06:15.414
Kion, Ono can't see.

06:15.448 --> 06:19.251
Yes, I can!
And I'm still the keenest of sight.

06:19.285 --> 06:21.086
Come on, I'll prove it!

06:21.121 --> 06:22.988
- Ono!
- Be careful!

06:24.024 --> 06:25.024
Wait up!

06:28.128 --> 06:34.166
Hmm.
In my eye, it is not yet right.

06:34.200 --> 06:37.069
Ono! You should be taking it easy!

06:37.103 --> 06:39.038
Flying is easy!

06:39.072 --> 06:42.107
I hurt my eye, not my wings.

06:42.142 --> 06:45.477
Just watch, you'll see.
I can still help the Guard.

06:47.313 --> 06:50.082
I can see everything from up here.

06:51.151 --> 06:53.052
Oi, watch where you're going!

06:54.254 --> 06:55.320
Hmm.

06:56.456 --> 06:58.023
Incoming!

06:59.159 --> 07:01.026
Whoa-whoa-whoa!

07:01.061 --> 07:03.162
Whoa!

07:06.466 --> 07:09.101
Ono, are you okay?

07:10.437 --> 07:12.204
I'm good.

07:12.238 --> 07:16.108
Maybe you shouldn't be flying
around with just one eye?

07:18.344 --> 07:20.345
Interesting.

07:20.380 --> 07:23.415
Ono, I really think
you should take a break.

07:23.450 --> 07:25.451
But doesn't the Guard need me?

07:26.453 --> 07:28.420
I'm the keenest of sight.

07:28.455 --> 07:30.155
You were the keenest of sight.

07:30.190 --> 07:32.391
- Easy, Bunga.
- Kion?

07:32.425 --> 07:34.993
You just need to get better, Ono.

07:35.028 --> 07:37.096
You'll be back on duty in no time.

07:37.130 --> 07:39.465
But for now, let's get you
back to the lair.

07:39.499 --> 07:41.166
Okay.

07:43.303 --> 07:45.304
Definitely interesting.

07:49.442 --> 07:51.443
And so on the question
as to whether

07:51.478 --> 07:54.146
impala or reedbuck
tastes better,

07:54.180 --> 07:57.349
the parliament finds more
deliberation is necessary.

07:57.383 --> 07:58.383
Mzingo.

08:00.453 --> 08:02.054
Sorry I'm late!

08:03.123 --> 08:05.991
Mwoga. Mwoga.

08:06.025 --> 08:07.993
Motion to allow
Mwoga to join

08:08.027 --> 08:11.196
parliamentary procedures
already in progress.

08:12.165 --> 08:14.199
- Aye!
- Nay!

08:14.234 --> 08:15.300
The ayes have it.

08:15.335 --> 08:18.237
Mwoga, you may rejoin
the parliament.

08:21.007 --> 08:24.409
I trust you have a compelling
reason for being late.

08:24.444 --> 08:28.247
Indeed. It seems that
Ono of the Lion Guard

08:28.281 --> 08:31.350
is no longer able to see
out of one eye.

08:31.384 --> 08:34.385
The keenest of sight
can no longer see?

08:34.419 --> 08:37.456
Hmm. That is interesting.

08:37.490 --> 08:41.994
I suggest we form a subcommittee
to study the situation.

08:42.028 --> 08:44.296
Capital idea.
Do I hear a second?

08:46.132 --> 08:48.100
Aye!

08:48.134 --> 08:49.268
Very well.

08:49.302 --> 08:52.271
The meeting to nominate
subcommittee members

08:52.305 --> 08:56.175
to study the severity
of Ono's loss of eyesight

08:56.209 --> 08:58.043
will go to
the planning committee

08:58.077 --> 09:00.979
for a vote during
the next session.

09:01.014 --> 09:02.314
I feel the need to...

09:02.348 --> 09:05.984
- inform...
- Can we go now? I'm hungry.

09:06.019 --> 09:08.020
Shh! The vultures always know

09:08.054 --> 09:10.022
what's going on in the Pride Lands.

09:10.056 --> 09:13.091
And it sounds like Ono can't see.

09:14.194 --> 09:15.327
Ono can't see!

09:15.361 --> 09:17.196
Yeah! That's great!

09:17.230 --> 09:20.232
Uh, why is that great?

09:20.266 --> 09:25.037
Because, fur brain, Ono is
the Guard's eyes in the sky.

09:25.071 --> 09:27.039
Any time I got
a brilliant plan,

09:27.073 --> 09:29.408
Ono spots it
and the Guard ruins it.

09:29.442 --> 09:32.077
But, if he can't see
anymore...

09:33.179 --> 09:34.379
I got an idea. Come on!

09:34.414 --> 09:38.383
And before you ask,
yes, it involves food.

09:41.154 --> 09:43.388
How'd he know we were
thinking about food?

09:43.423 --> 09:46.258
We're always
thinking about food!

09:46.292 --> 09:48.227
Oh, yeah!

09:48.261 --> 09:50.362
Hey, hey, hey, wait for us.

09:50.396 --> 09:52.264
So, what's the idea, Janja?

09:52.298 --> 09:54.399
Tell us the plan.
Tell us the plan!

11:57.290 --> 12:00.225
- How does it look?
- Uh, it is still not right.

12:01.427 --> 12:04.229
Try painting him in action.
Like this!

12:06.099 --> 12:08.166
- Now you try it.
- Like this?

12:10.370 --> 12:13.305
No, no, no. You need to
look more like a lion.

12:15.241 --> 12:17.309
How can Kion
look more like a lion?

12:17.343 --> 12:20.045
Like this.

12:20.480 --> 12:22.214
Ah.

12:22.248 --> 12:25.417
See? Now put your chin out,
like you mean it.

12:27.420 --> 12:29.388
Bunga, that tickles.

12:29.422 --> 12:33.325
Hmm, Kion, you're not
looking very lion-y.

12:33.359 --> 12:35.394
Let's see. Hmm.

12:35.428 --> 12:38.096
Whoa! Bunga!

12:38.131 --> 12:40.432
Was that action
enough for you, Rafiki?

12:40.466 --> 12:43.168
Hmm, yes.

12:43.202 --> 12:46.304
Wait a minute. I know.
Paint me in action.

12:51.444 --> 12:53.211
But don't paint me like this.

12:56.215 --> 12:58.350
Sorry, Rafiki.

12:58.384 --> 13:00.218
No, no, no.
Thank you for the help.

13:00.253 --> 13:02.320
Now, please. No more help.

13:02.355 --> 13:04.122
I need to think in peace.

13:06.092 --> 13:08.326
Hey, you guys.
I have some news.

13:10.062 --> 13:11.296
No peace here.

13:11.330 --> 13:13.231
So what's the news, Beshte?

13:13.266 --> 13:15.300
Oh, it's really important.

13:15.334 --> 13:18.036
See, I was just down
at the watering hole.

13:18.070 --> 13:19.171
And my friend Kulu?

13:19.205 --> 13:21.139
Her cousin overheard
some buffalo

13:21.174 --> 13:24.042
talking about something
his sister saw earlier today

13:24.076 --> 13:26.311
when she was over in the
canyon near Chakula Plains.

13:26.345 --> 13:29.481
Poa! I'm glad I was there
to hear about it.

13:31.117 --> 13:33.218
And what was it, Beshte?

13:34.387 --> 13:36.221
What was what?

13:36.255 --> 13:38.190
What your friend
Kulu's cousin overheard

13:38.224 --> 13:40.425
the buffalo's sister say
she saw from the canyon!

13:40.460 --> 13:42.260
Oh, right.

13:43.429 --> 13:46.031
I almost forgot the
most important part.

13:46.065 --> 13:48.166
She saw Janja and his hyenas

13:48.201 --> 13:50.135
on the ledge
overlooking the plains.

13:50.169 --> 13:53.305
Janja?
Back in the Pride Lands?

13:53.339 --> 13:56.141
He wouldn't come back unless
he was planning something.

13:56.175 --> 13:57.442
Mmm.

13:57.477 --> 14:01.346
Oh! Did I mention there's a
herd of zebra grazing there?

14:01.380 --> 14:05.116
That's it! Janja's
planning to attack the zebras!

14:05.151 --> 14:08.186
Come on, we have to
get to Chakula Plains!

14:09.422 --> 14:13.291
- Till the Pride Lands' end...
- Lion Guard defend!

14:15.261 --> 14:17.462
Most of the
Lion Guard, defend.

14:21.234 --> 14:25.237
Ah! Why, why?
It is still not right!

14:28.441 --> 14:31.109
It looks fine to me, Rafiki.

14:31.143 --> 14:33.445
It's just like all the other
Lion Guard paintings.

14:33.479 --> 14:36.481
That is the problem.
The new Lion Guard,

14:36.516 --> 14:39.117
it is not like the others!

14:39.151 --> 14:42.220
Yet, it should be simple.

14:42.255 --> 14:46.057
Their leader
and those he leads.

14:46.459 --> 14:48.460
Ha-ha! Kion!

14:48.494 --> 14:51.062
He does not just lead you.

14:51.097 --> 14:52.397
You are all friends!

14:54.166 --> 14:58.069
Yes. Yes!
You all belong together!

14:58.104 --> 15:00.071
We do belong together.

15:00.373 --> 15:02.040
All of us.

15:02.074 --> 15:05.310
Eye or no eye, my place is
with the Guard.

15:05.344 --> 15:07.112
Thanks, Rafiki!

15:07.146 --> 15:09.347
I gotta get going if I'm
gonna catch up with them!

15:18.057 --> 15:23.061
There. 
Why're we doin' this, Janja?

15:23.095 --> 15:24.229
We can't eat rocks.

15:28.167 --> 15:31.202
- What?
- All part of my plan.

15:31.237 --> 15:35.006
- To eat zebras?
- The zebras are just the bait.

15:35.041 --> 15:37.275
To catch bigger zebras?

15:37.310 --> 15:41.012
No, fur brains!
To trap the Lion Guard!

15:41.047 --> 15:44.115
Uh, we're gonna eat
the Lion Guard?

15:44.150 --> 15:45.216
No! We're going to...

15:45.251 --> 15:47.062
Hurry! This way!

15:48.220 --> 15:52.090
Shh.
Here they come now.

15:52.124 --> 15:54.492
This is the fastest way
to the zebras! Come on!

15:54.527 --> 15:56.194
Now!

15:59.465 --> 16:02.000
Whoa!

16:04.337 --> 16:07.138
Quick! We'll have to take
the long way round!

16:07.173 --> 16:08.406
That's what you think.

16:14.046 --> 16:15.447
Whoa!

16:15.481 --> 16:18.216
Not again!
Take cover.

16:21.454 --> 16:23.254
Kion! Bunga!

16:23.289 --> 16:25.190
Bunga!

16:26.459 --> 16:28.059
Everyone okay?

16:28.094 --> 16:29.461
- Yep.
- I'm good.

16:29.495 --> 16:31.062
Let's do that again!

16:31.097 --> 16:35.000
- Right. Thanks, Beshte.
- Poa.

16:37.036 --> 16:39.104
Heyvi kabisa!

16:39.138 --> 16:41.740
What are the chances of
two rock slides making

16:41.741 --> 16:44.342
two walls in one day
with us in the middle?

16:44.377 --> 16:47.278
No chance.
This is Janja's doing.

16:47.313 --> 16:49.247
You got that right, Kion!

16:49.281 --> 16:52.217
You're trapped! I win!

16:54.253 --> 16:57.155
Looks like we're dining
on zebra today.

16:57.189 --> 17:00.158
And you can't do nothing to stop me!

17:00.192 --> 17:02.327
Don't even try it, Janja!

17:06.265 --> 17:08.299
How you gonna stop me, lion cub?

17:08.334 --> 17:10.300
You're all the way down there!

17:10.336 --> 17:13.371
Aw, poor little Lion Guard.

17:13.406 --> 17:15.973
Protectors of the Pride Lands.

17:16.008 --> 17:18.276
Stuck behind a big ol' wall.

17:21.347 --> 17:23.314
You fell right into my trap.

17:23.348 --> 17:26.351
Or my trap fell
right onto you!

17:28.253 --> 17:32.257
Come on, boys. All the zebra
you can eat. And more.

17:32.291 --> 17:34.225

What are you waiting for, Kion?

17:52.244 --> 17:55.013
Use the Roar!
Blast that wall!

17:55.047 --> 17:56.414
Uh, I can't, Bunga.

17:56.449 --> 17:59.084
The zebras are
right on the other side.

17:59.118 --> 18:01.152
The rocks could fly out
and hurt them.

18:01.187 --> 18:02.220
Oh, right.

18:03.289 --> 18:05.256
Then blast this wall.

18:05.291 --> 18:07.392
We can go around the long
way to get to the zebras,

18:07.426 --> 18:11.362
- and then... Oh.
- Then it'll be too late.

18:11.397 --> 18:13.364
I think I can move this rock.

18:13.399 --> 18:16.301
Maybe it'll make an opening big
enough for us to squeeze through.

18:16.335 --> 18:19.003
Worth a try.
Go for it, Beshte.

18:21.073 --> 18:23.041
Twende Kiboko!

18:23.075 --> 18:24.209
Whoa.

18:24.243 --> 18:26.010
Beshte! Watch out!

18:26.045 --> 18:27.245
Uh-oh.

18:27.279 --> 18:29.280
- Beshte, you okay?
- I'm okay.

18:29.315 --> 18:30.982
Sorry that didn't work.

18:31.016 --> 18:32.217
Don't worry, Beshte.

18:32.251 --> 18:34.419
We just have to come up with
something that will work.

18:34.453 --> 18:36.254
Guys, guys!

18:36.288 --> 18:37.455
- Ono!
- Hey, ya, Ono!

18:37.490 --> 18:40.992
I don't know if I can help,
but I'm here.

18:41.026 --> 18:44.229
You flew all the way here?
You must be feeling better.

18:44.263 --> 18:47.132
Well, I still can't see very well.

18:47.166 --> 18:49.400
It doesn't matter.
You flew here.

18:49.435 --> 18:51.302
And that gives me an idea.

18:51.337 --> 18:55.140
Ono, I'm gonna use the Roar
to blast those rocks.

18:55.174 --> 18:58.309
Fly over to the zebras and get
them to move away from the canyon.

18:58.344 --> 19:01.182
Easy enough.
You got it, Kion.

19:04.350 --> 19:08.219
If you would, please follow
me away from the canyon.

19:08.254 --> 19:11.156
Now, hurry. This way!
Don't push!

19:14.994 --> 19:18.329
Oh, come on.
Perhaps I've failed to emphasize

19:18.364 --> 19:21.032
the importance of following me.

19:21.066 --> 19:23.234
We're eating here.
Can't you see that?

19:24.003 --> 19:25.303
I can see.

19:25.337 --> 19:28.206
But what you can't see is
that the hyenas are coming!

19:28.240 --> 19:30.975
Hyenas? You guys chased them

19:31.010 --> 19:32.310
out of the Pride Lands yesterday!

19:32.344 --> 19:33.444
That's what we thought!

19:33.479 --> 19:36.281
Except when we were chasing them,
I got sand in my eye.

19:36.315 --> 19:37.549
It made it hard to fly.

19:37.583 --> 19:38.917
I still tried, but I accidentally

19:38.918 --> 19:41.352
dive-bombed my friends,
and they...

19:42.221 --> 19:43.288
they all had to run.

19:44.356 --> 19:45.390
Be right back.

19:50.029 --> 19:52.163
Move it!

19:54.166 --> 19:57.268
Panic and run!
Panic and run!

19:57.303 --> 20:00.238
♪ Out of the way

20:01.507 --> 20:05.176
 Hey.
Where's lunch going?

20:05.211 --> 20:08.313
Nowhere.

20:08.347 --> 20:10.348
Come on, boys. After them!

20:12.518 --> 20:14.385
I knew I could get you to move.

20:15.321 --> 20:16.454
Wow.

20:16.488 --> 20:18.156
Oh.

20:18.190 --> 20:20.258
- See anything, Little B?
- Yeah.

20:20.292 --> 20:22.360
Really? Did Ono get
the zebra to move?

20:22.394 --> 20:26.097
Oh, I don't know.
All I see are rocks.

20:26.131 --> 20:28.299
Don't worry.
I'm sure Ono can do it.

20:28.334 --> 20:29.500
Kion! Kion!

20:29.535 --> 20:32.470
The zebra are on the move!

20:32.504 --> 20:34.205
You're all clear to roar!

20:34.240 --> 20:37.242
Thanks, Ono.
Everyone, get behind me.

20:48.153 --> 20:49.187
Uh-oh.

21:00.165 --> 21:02.267
How's the plan
working now, Janja?

21:02.301 --> 21:06.337
I got plenty of plans, Kion.
Uh, new plan, fellas.

21:06.372 --> 21:09.140
Run!

21:11.210 --> 21:13.444
You haven't seen the last of me!

21:13.479 --> 21:16.414
Good job, Ono. We couldn't
have done it without you.

21:16.448 --> 21:19.017
Just glad to be
back on the team.

21:19.051 --> 21:20.318
You were always
on the team, Ono.

21:23.188 --> 21:26.124
Yes, yes, yes.
Now it is right.

21:26.158 --> 21:31.162
The leader of the Lion Guard
and his friends.

21:31.196 --> 21:33.064
It's perfect, Rafiki.

21:33.098 --> 21:34.299
What do you think, Ono?

21:34.333 --> 21:38.303
I think it's the best
painting I've even seen.

21:38.337 --> 21:41.272
That means
a great deal to me

21:41.307 --> 21:44.257
coming from the keenest of sight.

21:53.185 --> 21:54.385
Nice.

21:54.420 --> 21:58.222
This Lion Guard is best together.
