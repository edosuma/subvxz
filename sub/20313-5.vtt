[Gerry] Alright,
a few remin... Yes, Maya?

00:04.338 --> 00:05.506
May I go to the bathroom?

00:05.506 --> 00:07.633
I don't know Maya, "May you"?

00:07.633 --> 00:09.343
Sir, that only
works if she says,

00:09.343 --> 00:10.385
"Can I go to the bathroom".

00:10.385 --> 00:13.054
I don't know Ben, can you?

00:13.054 --> 00:14.431
[Gerry laughs]

00:14.431 --> 00:17.977
Yes Maya, you may
go to the bathroom.

00:17.977 --> 00:19.603
Guys, you're seniors,
you don't need to ask

00:19.603 --> 00:20.855
to go to the bathroom anymore.

00:20.855 --> 00:22.982
If you have to go,
just quietly leave.

00:22.982 --> 00:25.901
Just go, alright? I trust you.

00:25.901 --> 00:28.403
Alright, so recapping,

00:28.403 --> 00:30.948
we have a review tomorrow.
Make sure you're here for that.

00:30.948 --> 00:32.950
I don't want to go
through everything twice.

00:32.950 --> 00:34.994
The test is still next Thursday.

00:34.994 --> 00:37.287
And chapters on the test,

00:37.287 --> 00:39.748
chapters are one, two and four.

00:39.748 --> 00:41.124
So make...

00:42.292 --> 00:43.669
Well that backfired, didn't it?

00:45.546 --> 00:46.839
Where you going?

00:46.839 --> 00:48.007
I have to use the washroom.

00:48.007 --> 00:49.466
That rule doesn't apply to you.

00:49.466 --> 00:50.968
You only go in the bathroom
when I kick you out.

00:50.968 --> 00:53.345
-Well, kick me out.
-Not today.

00:53.345 --> 00:55.389
Are we ever going to get
our last test back?

00:55.389 --> 00:56.682
That's gonna work Jimmy,
you're staying.

Yup, I've been thinking
the exact same thing.

01:30.841 --> 01:32.509
Why is there a student
in the staff room?

01:32.509 --> 01:34.053
He's been coming in
everyday this week.

01:51.028 --> 01:52.613
There's only one week left.

01:52.613 --> 01:55.532
I need everyone to energize
their homeroom classes.

01:55.532 --> 01:57.993
To really double their efforts
for this final week.

01:57.993 --> 02:00.328
Might have been a good idea
to let us know about this...

02:00.328 --> 02:01.455
Food Drive.

02:04.207 --> 02:07.377
Oh, when did that go up?

02:07.377 --> 02:08.629

02:08.629 --> 02:10.380
I am donating my seats

02:12.049 --> 02:13.300
to the teacher who's class

02:13.300 --> 02:15.552
brings in the most food items.

02:15.552 --> 02:17.471
Wow. Do we have
to go with you,

02:17.471 --> 02:19.056
to the game if we win?

02:19.056 --> 02:21.809
[All teachers] Ooooh.

02:21.809 --> 02:23.226
No, Mr. Duncan you do not.

02:23.226 --> 02:25.020
However, if I were you,

02:25.020 --> 02:26.981
I'd be more concerned with
the fact that the teacher

02:26.981 --> 02:28.899
who brings in
the least food items

02:28.899 --> 02:31.902
gets three Saturday
detention supervisions.

02:31.902 --> 02:34.696
Okay, and while you're
telling all of this that.

02:34.696 --> 02:36.865
Why are you looking
directly at me?

02:36.865 --> 02:38.951
Last time I looked,
your class had failed

02:38.951 --> 02:41.202
to bring in a single item.
-Yeah but...

02:41.202 --> 02:42.496
[All teachers] Oooh.

03:24.371 --> 03:25.914

-Field hockey practice.

practice that matters Sheila.

03:41.763 --> 03:43.557
stick to the facts
and never, ever

03:43.557 --> 03:45.308
personally attack your opponent.

03:45.308 --> 03:47.310
That's correct.

03:47.310 --> 03:49.479
So, oddly enough,
these three rules

-to my home room, sir.
-Oh, you think donating one

04:10.042 --> 04:13.128
to your homeroom is enough
to end world hunger?

food drive? It's for teachers.

none of you have brought in

We have one week left.
Need I remind you?

05:46.305 --> 05:49.348
We get a pizza party! A pizza
party for the whole class

05:49.348 --> 05:50.600

05:50.600 --> 05:54.104
-I had pizza for lunch.
-Mmm, surprise.

Also, if we bring
in the most items,

05:55.939 --> 05:58.650

the teacher

05:58.650 --> 06:00.694

06:00.694 --> 06:02.196

-That still does nothing for us.

the student in the class...

06:07.408 --> 06:10.704
to the game, who brings
in the most items.

06:10.704 --> 06:13.165
Unless it's Jimmy.

06:13.165 --> 06:15.000
Or Maya. I'm not
listening to that.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.294
Because you will ask a million
questions during the game.

06:17.294 --> 06:19.378
You'll ask about, "When are
we getting our tests back?"

06:19.378 --> 06:22.049
I'm like, "I'm watching
the game Maya".

06:22.049 --> 06:23.967

Except Lana, I can't bring Lana.

and that is weird.

that's who I would bring.

sell you on that?

come from within?

We are helping the
people of Africa.

06:43.028 --> 06:45.113
This food isn't
for people in Africa.

shelter downtown.

09:07.255 --> 09:08.923
[Maya] Well, I wonder
what Mr. Callaghan

09:08.923 --> 09:11.176
will think of this.

09:11.176 --> 09:13.428
-See what she's gonna do?
-Why?

09:13.428 --> 09:15.180
'Cause that's what she does.

09:20.727 --> 09:22.812
Haha!

09:24.856 --> 09:26.774
Who's that? Stalin.

09:26.774 --> 09:28.402
See what I did there?

09:28.402 --> 09:30.820
See how I taught you?

09:30.820 --> 09:33.281
By making you go
through something?

09:33.281 --> 09:34.491
Dictatorship.

09:34.491 --> 09:37.952
I wanted to show you what Hitler

09:37.952 --> 09:40.080
and Stalin would have done.

09:40.080 --> 09:42.290
It was a lesson, there's
no marks for anyone.

09:42.290 --> 09:44.376
It was a lesson
so you could experience

09:44.376 --> 09:46.753
what a real
dictatorship was like.

09:46.753 --> 09:50.048
False promises,
give, taketh away.

09:50.048 --> 09:52.633
That's what I did.
That's how a teacher teaches,

09:52.633 --> 09:54.553
that was how I taught. Sorry.

09:54.553 --> 09:57.638
So I don't get the bonus
marks for the food?

09:57.638 --> 10:02.185
I believe the correct German
term for that is "Niet".

10:02.185 --> 10:03.686
Sir, that's Russian.

10:03.686 --> 10:08.567
Ah, pretty sure
that's German Maya, so...

10:08.567 --> 10:11.236
Miss Insensitive.

10:13.071 --> 10:15.990
Okay. Lesson learned.

10:15.990 --> 10:17.367
Hi, Ms. Walsh.

10:17.367 --> 10:18.826
I couldn't find
Ms. Galka to give her

10:18.826 --> 10:20.412
my permission slip
for tonight's game.

10:20.412 --> 10:22.289
Well, that's fine Sheila,
I'll take care of that.

10:22.289 --> 10:24.040
-Thanks.
-Actually,

10:24.040 --> 10:25.417
that won't be necessary.

10:25.417 --> 10:26.834
-I'm sorry?
-I talked it over

10:26.834 --> 10:28.253
with Ms. Galka. We both agreed

10:28.253 --> 10:29.963
that you should
skip field hockey

10:29.963 --> 10:32.799
in favor of the debate practice.

10:32.799 --> 10:35.469
Okay. But...

10:35.469 --> 10:38.888
Ms. Galka concurred that
athletics, though important,

10:38.888 --> 10:42.725
take 2nd place
to mental gymnastics.

10:42.725 --> 10:44.519
She concurred that, did she?

10:44.519 --> 10:47.230
Don't you have anything
else to do?

10:47.230 --> 10:49.399
Yup, I do.

10:49.399 --> 10:50.442
So, I'll see you
at debate practice?

10:50.442 --> 10:52.402
-Okay, sir.
-Great.

10:52.402 --> 10:56.114
And I'll see you after
you finish doing that thing

10:56.114 --> 10:57.282
that you said you had to do

10:57.282 --> 10:59.700
that wasn't hurting my feelings.

11:08.543 --> 11:11.463
-Nope, no. That's enough.
-Good.

11:11.463 --> 11:14.215
You can't be in the
staffroom Gary. Out.

11:14.215 --> 11:16.801
-It's pronounced Gawee.
-Yeah,

11:16.801 --> 11:18.803
but it's Gary is your name.

11:18.803 --> 11:20.555
Alright?
-It actually is Gawee.

11:20.555 --> 11:23.266
-[Gerry] His name is Gawee?
-[Simon] Yeah, it's Gawee.

11:23.266 --> 11:25.018
G-A-W-E-E.

11:25.018 --> 11:26.394
His grandparents
couldn't pronounce Gary,

11:26.394 --> 11:27.812
so they just officially
made it Gawee.

11:27.812 --> 11:29.648
-That's not a name.
-Show him your ID.

11:29.648 --> 11:31.107
Let me see your ID.

11:31.107 --> 11:32.691
No way that's your name.

11:35.612 --> 11:38.281
Alright, Gawee/Gary,

11:38.281 --> 11:40.033
you can't stay here. Out.

11:40.033 --> 11:41.409
-But my dad...
-But my dad...

11:41.409 --> 11:42.994
your dad is not
a teacher here. Okay?

11:42.994 --> 11:46.373
He's the librarian,
doesn't count. Out.

11:46.373 --> 11:49.750
-Nice one Gewee.
-What?

11:49.750 --> 11:51.836
What?

11:51.836 --> 11:54.506
-I thought you said Gewee.
-I don't think so.

11:54.506 --> 11:57.634
Sheila, that was parfait,
as we say in French.

11:57.634 --> 11:58.593
Let's try it again.

11:58.593 --> 12:00.637
[Bobbi clears her throat]

12:00.637 --> 12:02.138
Ms. Galka, what brings you by?

12:02.138 --> 12:04.474
I'm here to get Sheila.
We have a game tonight.

12:04.474 --> 12:06.100
Oh, wait...no you haven't.

12:06.100 --> 12:07.768
You and I talked about
this, remember?

12:07.768 --> 12:10.063
I pulled rank.
You said I was cute.

12:10.063 --> 12:11.898
Got it. Sheila? Time to go.

12:11.898 --> 12:13.358
Sheila is not going anywhere.

12:13.358 --> 12:15.276
-She's our star debater.
-But sir?

12:15.276 --> 12:17.028
-Yeah, Sheila, stay out of this.
-Sir?

12:17.028 --> 12:18.905
Sheila, no arguing.
This is debate club.

12:18.905 --> 12:21.115
Okay, Robert, we have
a tournament. Okay?

12:21.115 --> 12:22.701
-That supersedes your practice.
-Really?

12:22.701 --> 12:24.536
'Cause we have a big
debate next week.

12:24.536 --> 12:26.204
And if we don't practice,
we're not going to win.

12:26.204 --> 12:27.622
Why don't you guys
debate it then?

12:27.622 --> 12:29.165
[Bobbi] We're not going
to debate it Lori.

12:29.165 --> 12:31.334
Oh, Lori.

12:31.334 --> 12:33.628
What a marvellous idea,
why don't we debate it?

12:33.628 --> 12:35.338
I'm not going to debate
this with you Robert.

12:35.338 --> 12:37.006
Why? 'Cause you're scared?

12:37.006 --> 12:38.299
[Lori] 'Cause you're scared?

12:38.299 --> 12:40.176
No, I'm not scared.

12:40.176 --> 12:41.553
Aren't you? 'Cause
you kind of look it.

12:41.553 --> 12:42.803
Really? 'Cause you look it.

12:42.803 --> 12:45.139
No, this is juvenile Lori.

12:45.139 --> 12:46.933
-[Robert] Is it?
-[Lori] Is it?

12:46.933 --> 12:50.562
[Bobbi] Yeah, okay enough.
Fine, fine let's debate this.

12:50.562 --> 12:53.607
Fine, looks like we have
a master debate on our hands.

12:55.650 --> 12:57.652
That is how you win a debate.

12:57.652 --> 12:58.737

12:58.737 --> 13:00.029
[Lisa] This is ridiculous.

13:00.029 --> 13:02.907

in my homeroom class.

13:02.907 --> 13:05.702
I can't compete
with classes of over 20.

13:05.702 --> 13:08.204
-Thank God for Gerry.
-I know right.

13:08.204 --> 13:09.956
It's so little.

13:09.956 --> 13:11.666
Hey guys. Excuse me while I, uh,

13:11.666 --> 13:13.668
just do a quick update
here on the standings.

13:13.668 --> 13:15.086
-[Dwyer] What are you doing?
-You can't just

13:15.086 --> 13:16.879
color it in Gerry.
-[Gerry] Yeah I can.

13:16.879 --> 13:18.214
They'll update it soon. But, uh,

13:18.214 --> 13:20.091
my students just
brought in over 600 cans,

13:20.091 --> 13:21.635
so I just thought I'd...

13:21.635 --> 13:24.304
-You must have done something.
-Yeah, what did you do?

13:24.304 --> 13:26.180
Motivated my students
for a good cause.

13:26.180 --> 13:27.265
That's what I did.

13:27.265 --> 13:28.933
You two should try it.

13:28.933 --> 13:31.478
And you, last place,

13:31.478 --> 13:33.062
enjoy your three
Saturday detentions.

13:33.062 --> 13:34.481
-But this is...
-Ahh!

13:34.481 --> 13:35.898
[Gerry sniffs the marker]

13:35.898 --> 13:37.317
Whoo!

13:37.317 --> 13:38.652
[Gerry laughs]

13:38.652 --> 13:39.860
You know what that is?

13:39.860 --> 13:41.988
The smell of success.

13:43.906 --> 13:45.700
Nah, he must have
done something.

13:45.700 --> 13:46.909
I wasn't really doing anything

13:46.909 --> 13:48.869
on those Saturday's anyway.

13:48.869 --> 13:51.539
[Robert] Be resolved
that a debate practice

13:51.539 --> 13:54.167
is more important than
a field hockey game.

13:55.335 --> 13:57.003
I will let my opponent begin.

13:57.003 --> 13:58.963
[Bobbi] Okay, um...

13:58.963 --> 14:01.215
Be it resolved that...

14:01.215 --> 14:03.384
Sheila, this is a chance
at a full scholarship

14:03.384 --> 14:04.803
at the school of your choice.

14:04.803 --> 14:07.430
Plus, the tournament's
in Montreal. So...

14:07.430 --> 14:09.974
-Sick!
-[Bobbi] Right? Come on.

14:09.974 --> 14:12.310
-Okay, may I rebut?
-Okay.

14:12.310 --> 14:15.229
Be it resolved that
the debate team

14:15.229 --> 14:18.107
will not only continue
to stimulate your mind.

14:18.107 --> 14:21.277
But also ensure
your mental freshness

14:21.277 --> 14:23.112
well into your golden years.

14:23.112 --> 14:25.365
Nice.

14:25.365 --> 14:27.534
We're going to Montreal.

14:27.534 --> 14:28.618
[Bobbi laughs]

14:28.618 --> 14:30.161
Okay. Great,

14:30.161 --> 14:32.246
but through debate...
-Mmm hmm.

14:32.246 --> 14:34.874
You can in theory travel
anywhere you want

14:34.874 --> 14:38.503
all over the globe simply
by using your imagination

14:38.503 --> 14:41.088

14:41.088 --> 14:45.134
Wow, okay 'cause you are
actually going to Montreal,

14:45.134 --> 14:46.678
like next week.

14:46.678 --> 14:49.972
And why would she want
to go to Montreal, Ms. Galka?

14:49.972 --> 14:52.058
To get wasted?
-I didn't say that Robert.

14:52.058 --> 14:54.227
Didn't you? 'Cause
that's what I heard.

14:54.227 --> 14:56.020
-Mr. Cheeley that...
-You'd probably like Montreal

14:56.020 --> 14:58.648
with all it's strip clubs.
-Mr. Cheeley...

14:58.648 --> 15:01.150
Well, Ms. Galka? Sheila,
where are you going?

15:01.150 --> 15:03.695
Ms. Galka presented
the better argument.

15:03.695 --> 15:06.906
-[Robert] No, she didn't.
-Yeah, I did.

15:06.906 --> 15:08.366
Be it resolved that
no she didn't.

15:08.366 --> 15:09.450
-[Bobbi] Yeah.
-[Robert] No she did not.

15:09.450 --> 15:10.827
I wasn't even finished.

15:10.827 --> 15:12.787
We don't even need
you on this team.

15:12.787 --> 15:15.540

By the way, don't worry.

15:17.041 --> 15:19.919
I've been to Montreal,
it's not that great.

15:21.755 --> 15:24.340
It's pretty great.

15:24.340 --> 15:26.133
Alright.

15:28.511 --> 15:30.054
What happened to all our food?

15:30.054 --> 15:31.765
[Jimmy] We took it to
the food shelter during lunch.

15:31.765 --> 15:33.683
Why would you do that?
-Well, you know, we thought

15:33.683 --> 15:36.269
we'd show some initiative.
Get the cans to Africa faster.

15:36.269 --> 15:37.645
But nobody's counted the items,

15:37.645 --> 15:39.230
they don't even know
we have them yet.

I'm a teacher down

bring down some food.
