        Cheers <i>is filmed</i>        
 <i>before a live studio audience.</i> 

00:08.100 --> 00:09.300
          Watch this.           
                         Okay...

00:17.300 --> 00:18.400
          What do you got, Wood?

00:18.500 --> 00:22.800
Watch closely as I remove       
      my own index finger.      

00:22.900 --> 00:24.500
    Uh-huh.                     

00:24.500 --> 00:25.600
    It's something I learned    
         from my uncle,         

00:25.700 --> 00:27.600
only when I do it, it's a trick.

00:29.500 --> 00:31.600
              Eh?               

00:31.700 --> 00:32.800
            Uh, not bad but, uh,

00:32.900 --> 00:34.800
          I think Cliffy's still
        ahead on points here.   

00:34.900 --> 00:36.700
     And in what sophomoric     
            activity            

00:36.800 --> 00:38.700
    are you gentlemen           
         involved now?          

00:38.800 --> 00:41.700
Our first annual tricks         
with digits exhibition!         

00:43.200 --> 00:45.100
Of all the pointless wastes     
of human energy.                

00:45.200 --> 00:46.900
                Frasier's right.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.500
        You could sit here until
      the end of time doing your

00:49.500 --> 00:50.900
  silly little finger tricks,   

00:50.900 --> 00:53.600
but none of you will ever       
      be able to top this.      

01:01.500 --> 01:03.900
    Wow, she's right.           

01:03.900 --> 01:04.800
The king is dead.               

01:04.900 --> 01:06.500
Long live the queen!            

01:06.600 --> 01:09.100
                        NORM:   
          Yes and she's writing!

01:09.200 --> 01:11.300
                 She's going for
                bonus points.   

01:11.300 --> 01:12.700
                          CLIFF:
                  What's it say?

01:12.800 --> 01:14.700
"My fist is stuck.              
Call 911."                      

01:18.200 --> 01:19.200
            FRASIER:            
         Come on, hon.          

01:19.300 --> 01:20.300
                  You know, this
                  happens to her

01:20.400 --> 01:22.000
                 more often than
                    you'd think.

01:26.900 --> 01:28.700

02:35.900 --> 02:37.900
How am I supposed to make       
      a drink around here?      

02:38.000 --> 02:41.100
  We're out of gin, vermouth,   
    cherries and lime juice.    

02:41.100 --> 02:42.700
We gotta get into               
that storeroom.                 

02:42.800 --> 02:43.800
                    We can't.   

02:43.800 --> 02:45.300
         Sam said to substitute.

02:45.300 --> 02:47.300
Okay.                           

02:49.300 --> 02:51.300
                    Here you go.

02:51.300 --> 02:52.400
What the hell                   
is this?                        

02:52.500 --> 02:54.400
                It's clam juice.

02:56.500 --> 02:58.200
      I wanted a martini.       

02:58.200 --> 03:00.900
         I wanted to be Princess
                Carla of Monaco.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
                    Drink it!   

03:03.000 --> 03:05.300
                          Sorry,

03:05.400 --> 03:06.400
         Mr. Krapence.          

03:06.500 --> 03:08.300
  We can't get into the office  
        or the storeroom        

03:08.300 --> 03:09.700
    because Miss Howe           
    locked herself in           

03:09.700 --> 03:12.000
 since she decided not to marry 
          Mr. Colcord.          

03:12.100 --> 03:12.800
                     She's still
                    in there.   

03:12.900 --> 03:13.900
                     She's still
                    in the gown.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.100
                  She won't talk
                     to anybody.

03:15.200 --> 03:16.600
                Doesn't move.   
                    Doesn't eat.

03:16.600 --> 03:18.100
    Gee, that's awful.          

03:18.100 --> 03:20.100
I really wanted a martini.      

03:23.200 --> 03:24.900
         Greetings all!         

03:25.000 --> 03:25.700
A pint of lager,                

03:25.800 --> 03:27.600
    my good publican!           

03:27.700 --> 03:29.800
I'm of a Dickensian spirit      
             today.             

03:29.900 --> 03:32.300
I've just come from             
the Antiquarian Book Fair,      

03:32.400 --> 03:34.600
where I managed to luck         
into a handsomely bound         

03:34.700 --> 03:37.700
first edition of Charles        
Dickens' <i>Tale of Two Cities.</i>    

03:37.700 --> 03:39.200
                            Wow!

03:39.200 --> 03:40.300
            If you don't mind   
                      my asking,

03:40.400 --> 03:42.300
         how much does something
      like this cost, Dr. Crane?

03:42.400 --> 03:44.200
Well, uh, Woody, money          
isn't really the issue,         

03:44.300 --> 03:47.100
but, uh, around $1,200.         

03:47.100 --> 03:48.400
              (scoffs, snickers)

03:48.400 --> 03:50.900
                    1,200 bucks?

03:50.900 --> 03:52.700
                Got something to
            show you, Dr. Crane.

03:52.800 --> 03:56.500
                It's called a   
                library card.   

03:57.200 --> 03:59.300
Thank you for the advice, Woody.

03:59.300 --> 04:01.300
    Now may I have a scotch     
     on the rocks, please?      

04:01.300 --> 04:02.900
                    Okeydoke!   

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
            That'll be around   
                    1,200 bucks.

04:07.400 --> 04:09.500
     Oh, Frasier, you know,     
 it's a good thing you're here  

04:09.500 --> 04:11.100
                because we gotta
            think of some way   

04:11.200 --> 04:13.200
          to get that crazy lady
              out of the office.

04:13.200 --> 04:14.600
             It's been two days.

04:14.700 --> 04:16.500
      Well, I realize that      
 you're concerned about Rebecca 

04:16.600 --> 04:18.000
  and that you all look to me   

04:18.000 --> 04:19.800
         as the solver          
of all problems personal,       

04:19.800 --> 04:21.600
    but, in this case,          
  I have to throw up my hands.  

04:21.700 --> 04:23.500
    I mean, there's a limit     
     to what even I can do.     

04:23.600 --> 04:25.100
                And we also know
                    how you pout

04:25.200 --> 04:26.800
          when we don't ask you.

04:28.800 --> 04:30.700
         Well... fine.          

04:30.800 --> 04:32.700
    Maybe I'll just go home.    

04:34.700 --> 04:36.300
             Okay!              

04:36.300 --> 04:38.300
  I've got the tool box here.   

04:38.300 --> 04:41.300
I'm gonna get Rebecca out       
of that office right now.       

04:42.800 --> 04:44.900
            Rebecca!            

04:45.000 --> 04:47.700
  I've got a screwdriver here!  

04:47.800 --> 04:49.800
I'm gonna take that doorknob off

04:49.800 --> 04:52.800
  and I'm gonna open the door   
             here.              

04:54.200 --> 04:57.800
 Rebecca, I got a Phillips head 
          by mistake,           

04:57.900 --> 05:01.000
        but I'm gonna...        

05:01.100 --> 05:05.000
I'm putting that down and       
I'm picking up a flathead,      

05:05.100 --> 05:08.000
  and then I'm gonna take that  
         doorknob off.          

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
     Rebecca, I don't have      
          a flathead,           

05:13.000 --> 05:16.000
    but I have one of those     
          putty things          

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
    and I'm gonna put it...     

05:18.000 --> 05:20.300
             Damn!              

05:20.400 --> 05:24.000
Okay, Rebecca, I just punctured 
my thumb with that, uh...       

05:24.000 --> 05:27.200
  putty thing and I'm gonna go  
      get a tetanus shot,       

05:27.300 --> 05:29.200
          then I'm...           

05:29.300 --> 05:31.200
coming back here                
and taking that doorknob off.   

05:31.300 --> 05:33.200
              Here's a Band-Aid.

05:33.300 --> 05:35.100
Hey, hey, guys!                 
Rebecca!                        

05:35.200 --> 05:36.700
Hey!                            
    Rebecca's out.              
                        REBECCA:
                         No, no.

05:36.800 --> 05:38.000
              Don't say Rebecca.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.500
                Don't call me   
                        Rebecca.

05:39.600 --> 05:42.500
            Rebecca doesn't live
                here anymore.   

05:42.600 --> 05:45.500
                Rebecca died two
                    days ago.   

05:45.600 --> 05:47.600
Oh! So that's                   
what that is.                   

05:47.700 --> 05:50.500
    Whoof!                      

05:50.500 --> 05:51.800
I'm telling you,                

05:51.900 --> 05:54.900
a woman should never            
sweat in taffeta.               

05:56.800 --> 05:58.500
              Have a seat.      
                Come on.        

05:58.600 --> 06:00.700
                      Thank you.

06:00.700 --> 06:02.300
                         Wow.   

06:02.400 --> 06:04.100
                I've never sat  
                 here before.   

06:06.100 --> 06:08.200
              Here I am, sitting
                  on this stool,

06:08.300 --> 06:10.700
                 knowing my life
                      is a mess.

06:10.800 --> 06:12.900
        I have no future, and...

06:13.000 --> 06:15.700
                 I'm a totally  
            hopeless failure.   

06:15.800 --> 06:17.700
  Yeah. Try it                  
  with beer nuts.               

06:21.300 --> 06:22.900
             It is all my fault.

06:22.900 --> 06:24.600
                I mean, I got   
                 what I deserve.

06:24.700 --> 06:25.800
              And now I'm alone.

06:25.800 --> 06:28.200
             I... I have nothing
                 and I'm just a,

06:28.200 --> 06:30.800
            you know, worthless,
                 shallow person.

06:30.900 --> 06:33.800
I'm telling you,                
try it with the beer nuts.      

06:35.900 --> 06:38.300
        Rebecca...              

06:38.400 --> 06:41.100
  I realize you haven't sought  
  my professional advice, but   

06:41.200 --> 06:43.200
I think it's time               
to get some perspective,        

06:43.300 --> 06:44.600
    take a look at yourself.    

06:44.700 --> 06:48.000
 Splash some water on your face 
     and get a fresh start.     

06:48.000 --> 06:49.400
        I'd like to, Frasier,   

06:49.500 --> 06:52.100
         but I seem to have lost
            the will to move.   

06:52.200 --> 06:55.100
         I just want to sit here
        for the rest of my life.

06:55.200 --> 06:57.400
          Geez, maybe           
        it's the stool.         

07:03.300 --> 07:05.200
                        Come on,
                      Miss Howe.

07:05.300 --> 07:07.300
                Woody...        

07:07.400 --> 07:10.000
         have you ever          
      had your whole life       

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
              cave in on you    
             all of a sudden?   

07:12.000 --> 07:14.300
  No, but I have had            
  a cave cave in on me          

07:14.400 --> 07:16.700
    all of a sudden.            

07:16.700 --> 07:19.100
You know, at the risk           
of sounding insensitive,        

07:19.200 --> 07:22.100
I'm... I'm glad she's           
getting out of here.            

07:22.200 --> 07:24.300
Her walking around              
in that wedding dress           

07:24.300 --> 07:26.800
was just a tad too              
"Miss Havisham" for me.         

07:28.100 --> 07:30.000
                        Who?    
Miss Havisham.                  

07:30.000 --> 07:31.600
Famous character                
from Charles Dickens'           

07:31.700 --> 07:33.300
 <i>Great Expectations.</i>            

07:33.400 --> 07:34.600
Spends the entire novel         

07:34.600 --> 07:35.900
walking around                  
in her wedding dress.           

07:36.000 --> 07:37.900
                What?!          
                            Yes.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.800
Well, surely you know it.       

07:39.800 --> 07:41.400
    It's <i>Great Expectations.</i>    

07:41.500 --> 07:43.300
      Pip? Miss Havisham?       

07:43.300 --> 07:44.800
            Magwich?            

07:44.900 --> 07:48.200
And, uh... and four...          

07:48.200 --> 07:49.300
pizza-loving turtles            

07:49.400 --> 07:51.600
who practice martial            
arts in the sewer.              

07:53.100 --> 07:56.200
        Oh, cowabunga, dudes!   

07:56.200 --> 07:57.500
                          CLIFF:
                    You know,   

07:57.500 --> 07:59.000
there's a lot of people         
    don't realize               

07:59.100 --> 08:01.000
      that that was             
a comic book first.             

08:04.800 --> 08:06.800
 I'm gonna go for a drive, Sam. 

08:06.900 --> 08:08.700
SAM:                            
Oh, yes, sweetheart.            

08:08.700 --> 08:10.700
That's a good idea.             
You know, get some fresh air.   

08:10.800 --> 08:12.500
Take all the time               
you want.                       
Thank you.                      

08:14.500 --> 08:16.300
Where did she get those clothes?

08:16.400 --> 08:18.600
                          WOODY:
             Hey, Sam, could you
            dig some clothes out

08:18.700 --> 08:20.500
    of lost and found?          

08:28.600 --> 08:29.800
          Here you go.          

08:29.800 --> 08:32.200
    Woody, come on out here.    
    Let's take a look.          

08:32.299 --> 08:34.000
          Hey, Sam, how long did
        you say these clothes   

08:34.200 --> 08:35.600
                have been in the
                 lost and found?

08:35.600 --> 08:37.400
         I don't know--         
     a while, I guess. Why?     

08:40.200 --> 08:43.100
(laughing)                      

08:49.500 --> 08:51.200
Is that Woody Boyd?             

08:51.300 --> 08:53.400
Or is that                      
Keith Partridge?!               

08:55.300 --> 08:59.100
 When is Miss Howe getting back 
     with my real clothes?      

08:59.200 --> 09:01.900
     I can't go out like this.  

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
        I mean, I know it was   
          the '70s and all,     

09:04.100 --> 09:06.700
 but who would dress in anything
        this dumb-looking?      

09:08.700 --> 09:11.900
    Those duds look familiar.   

09:13.700 --> 09:17.000
        "Property               
         of C. Clavin."         

09:17.800 --> 09:21.300
Deep inside, didn't             
we all know that?               

09:21.400 --> 09:22.900
        (laughing)              

09:23.000 --> 09:24.700
                  These are your
            clothes, Mr. Clavin?

09:24.700 --> 09:26.000
         Yeah, I guess.         

09:26.100 --> 09:27.400
    Well, how'd they end up     
     in the lost and found?     

09:27.500 --> 09:28.800
 How did they end up in there?  

09:28.900 --> 09:31.000
Well, it was the '70s,          

09:31.000 --> 09:33.100
(chuckles):                     
and I was a swinger.            

09:35.500 --> 09:36.800
             Uh-oh.             

09:36.900 --> 09:38.700
I had some good times           
in those rags, Woody.           

09:38.700 --> 09:40.500
         Cliff, we don't want to
          hear about it, please.

09:40.600 --> 09:42.300
Huh? Oh, it was great.          

09:42.400 --> 09:43.700
You know, hey,                  
the disco scene,                

09:43.800 --> 09:44.700
                    grooving.   

09:44.800 --> 09:46.200
Ixnay, Cliff.                   

09:46.300 --> 09:47.600
          Yeah, it was          
      a great decade, huh?      

09:47.700 --> 09:48.900
    Hot-tubbing every night.    

09:48.900 --> 09:50.000
         I got rolfed.          

09:50.100 --> 09:51.200
WOODY:                          
Oh.                             

09:51.300 --> 09:53.600
    Please stop, Mr. Clavin.    

09:53.700 --> 09:56.000
    Oh, now I remember          
how I lost those clothes.       

09:56.000 --> 09:57.700
    Oh, don't say it;           
         don't say it.          

09:57.800 --> 09:59.300
I was streaking!                

09:59.400 --> 10:00.600
Oh! I knew it!                  

10:00.600 --> 10:02.600
I knew he was gonna             
say it!                         

10:02.700 --> 10:04.600
Of course, I was about          
three pounds lighter then.      

10:06.600 --> 10:07.900
                        FRASIER:
                        Woody...

10:08.000 --> 10:09.100
    I think it was              
a great sacrifice               

10:09.200 --> 10:10.700
     for you to give            
your clothes to Rebecca.        

10:10.800 --> 10:12.000
              It puts me in mind

10:12.100 --> 10:14.300
      of another novel by       
  my favorite British author.   

10:14.400 --> 10:16.200
      You know who I mean.      

10:16.300 --> 10:17.500
I'll give you a hint.           

10:17.500 --> 10:19.400
          Charles...?           

10:19.500 --> 10:21.700
                     In Charge? 

10:21.800 --> 10:23.700
    (laughs)                    

10:23.800 --> 10:25.700
Are you people really           
this ignorant                   

10:25.800 --> 10:27.700
or do you just do this          
to torture me?                  

10:27.700 --> 10:30.700
        Uh, sometimes the two   
                go hand-in-hand.

10:30.700 --> 10:32.000
All right.                      

10:32.100 --> 10:33.500
  Gather around,                
  everyone.                     

10:33.600 --> 10:35.700
I am going to right             
a horrible wrong.               

10:35.700 --> 10:38.000
I am going to read to you       
Dickens' classic,               

10:38.100 --> 10:39.600
 <i>A Tale of Two Cities,</i>          

10:39.700 --> 10:41.400
                and you will see
            just how much fun   

10:41.400 --> 10:42.900
        great literature can be.

10:42.900 --> 10:44.400
         (all groaning)         

10:44.400 --> 10:45.900
                        FRASIER:
                "Book the First.

10:46.000 --> 10:49.200
It was the best of times,       
  it was the worst of times."   

10:49.300 --> 10:50.300
Hey, wait,                      
whoa, whoa, whoa.               

10:50.400 --> 10:53.200
Which was it?                   

10:57.400 --> 10:59.400
     Just stay tuned, Norm.     

11:01.700 --> 11:04.100
"It was the age of wisdom,      
 it was the age of foolishness. 

11:04.200 --> 11:07.300
 It was the epoch of belief, it 
 was the epoch of incredulity." 

11:07.300 --> 11:08.800
     Boy, this Dickens guy      
          really liked          

11:08.800 --> 11:10.800
to keep his butt covered,       
        didn't he?              

11:15.400 --> 11:17.300
    "There was a king           
    with a large jaw,           

11:17.400 --> 11:19.600
"and a queen with a plain face, 

11:19.700 --> 11:21.200
                  "on the throne
                     of England.

11:21.300 --> 11:24.700
            "And... and..."     

11:25.700 --> 11:28.100
    "...and there was           
     a bloodthirsty clown,      

11:28.200 --> 11:30.900
          "who beckoned innocent
        children into the sewer,

11:31.000 --> 11:32.400
and swallowed them whole."      

11:34.100 --> 11:35.600
                      Ah!       

11:35.700 --> 11:38.300
            That's a neat trick.

11:38.300 --> 11:40.100
        (phone ringing)         

11:40.200 --> 11:41.900
 Wait-wait-wait a minute, Fras, 
          wait there.           

11:42.000 --> 11:43.300
      Yeah, Cheers. What?       

11:44.900 --> 11:46.300
     Hey... uh... Rebecca!      

11:46.400 --> 11:48.500
  Where are you calling from?   
     I can barely hear you.     

11:48.500 --> 11:50.900
30,000 feet over Pittsburgh.    

11:51.000 --> 11:52.100
             What?              

11:52.200 --> 11:53.800
    I thought you were just     
    going for a drive.          

11:53.800 --> 11:55.500
             I did.             
    I drove to the airport.     

11:55.600 --> 11:57.000
            Listen,             

11:57.100 --> 11:58.600
      will you tell Woody       
      that I left his car       

11:58.700 --> 12:01.100
  outside the United terminal.  

12:01.200 --> 12:03.200
          Or American.          

12:03.200 --> 12:04.900
    It doesn't really           
      make any difference.      

12:05.000 --> 12:08.300
    They all tow them           
to the same place anyway.       

12:09.800 --> 12:10.900
         Sam, is that Miss Howe?

12:10.900 --> 12:12.400
                  Ask her if she
                  has my wallet.

12:12.500 --> 12:14.700
                    I need my   
            driver's license.   

12:14.700 --> 12:17.600
Actually, you don't             
have to worry about             
that right now, Wood.           

12:17.600 --> 12:19.600
What are you doing?             
Where are you going?            

12:19.700 --> 12:21.900
    I'm-I'm going home          
    to San Diego, Sam.          

12:22.000 --> 12:23.700
I want to try and forget Boston.

12:23.800 --> 12:27.100
        I want to erase         
the last three years of my life.

12:27.200 --> 12:28.400
    It's been five, Rebecca.    

12:28.400 --> 12:30.600
     Has it been that long?     

12:32.800 --> 12:34.100
              Hey, Sam, does she
                 have my wallet?

12:34.200 --> 12:36.000
You still have Woody's          
wallet, don't you?              

12:36.100 --> 12:38.500
  Yeah, sure, how do you think  
I'm paying for this call?       

12:38.500 --> 12:41.500
     Hell, how do you think     
  I'm paying for this flight?   

12:41.500 --> 12:44.700
Yeah, she still has it.         

12:49.200 --> 12:51.300
Honey, listen to me.            

12:51.300 --> 12:53.400
You can't run away from         
your problems like this.        

12:53.500 --> 12:55.000
        Sam, Sam, look,         
    the only reason I called    

12:55.100 --> 12:57.900
      was to say good-bye       
 and thank you for everything.  

12:58.000 --> 13:00.700
 It's really meant a lot to me. 
            Bye-bye.            

13:01.700 --> 13:03.600
Oh, miss, did you remember      
your credit card?               

13:03.700 --> 13:05.100
    Oh, yeah, thanks.           

13:05.200 --> 13:06.400
      I'm gonna need this.      

13:06.500 --> 13:08.700
I need to buy a whole new       
     wardrobe when we land.     

13:08.700 --> 13:11.200
  I'm gonna be good to myself.  

13:18.700 --> 13:20.800
        As we recall...         

13:20.800 --> 13:24.600
from Monday's installment       
    of <i>A Tale of Two Cities,</i>    

13:24.600 --> 13:28.000
 Sydney Carton was about to go  
    to the guillotine           

13:28.100 --> 13:29.900
     and sacrifice himself.     

13:30.000 --> 13:32.600
The guillotine--                
slice that neck.                

13:32.700 --> 13:33.900
        (laughing)              

13:34.000 --> 13:37.500
        "When suddenly,         
    an Apache attack chopper    

13:37.600 --> 13:40.500
 "hovered above the guillotine, 

13:40.600 --> 13:42.700
        pumping hot lead        
        into the crowd."        

13:42.800 --> 13:44.600
            Get them Frogs, huh?

13:44.700 --> 13:46.900
    "As Darnay climbed          
    into the chopper,           

13:47.000 --> 13:49.600
        "sweat streaming        
from his bloodstained headband, 

13:49.600 --> 13:51.800
 "he could be heard to mutter,  

13:51.900 --> 13:54.500
    "'It is a far, far          
    better thing I do           

13:54.500 --> 13:56.500
    "'than I have ever done.    

13:56.600 --> 13:59.100
  "'It is a far, far better...  

13:59.200 --> 14:01.600
    "'butt-kicking I give...    

14:03.400 --> 14:05.700
      ...than I have ever       
         butt-kicked.'"         

14:05.700 --> 14:07.400
                All right.      
  Whoa!                         

14:07.500 --> 14:09.100
          What a book, huh?     

14:09.100 --> 14:10.900
                  Yeah, that was
             great, great, Fras.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.600
          What, uh, what are you
    going to read to us next?   

14:12.600 --> 14:15.700
Well, I was thinking about,     
uh, <i>David Copperfield.</i>          

14:15.800 --> 14:16.900
    What's that about?          

14:17.000 --> 14:19.300
Well, it's about                
these, uh...                    

14:19.400 --> 14:23.600
two coppers,                    
and this... field,              

14:23.700 --> 14:26.700
um... and they're found...      

14:26.800 --> 14:30.000
dismembered with their          
body parts switched.            

14:30.000 --> 14:31.600
CARLA:                          
Man...!                         

14:31.700 --> 14:34.900
    Man, that Dickens           
    is one sick dude.           

14:36.100 --> 14:38.400
      Have any of you guys      
    heard from Rebecca yet?     

14:38.500 --> 14:40.700
            Normie.             
            Turn on the game,   
                  will you, Sam?

14:40.800 --> 14:41.900
      No, no, no, come on,      
          let's, uh...          

14:42.000 --> 14:42.700
Let's give her                  
a call here.                    

14:42.900 --> 14:44.700
I got her parents'              
number here.                    

14:44.700 --> 14:45.900
Let's just tell her that,       
        you know,               

14:45.900 --> 14:47.900
    we're thinking about her    
    and that we care.           

14:49.300 --> 14:51.400
        Ah, hell,               
it's her parents' machine.      

14:51.500 --> 14:52.800
      I hate these things.      

14:52.800 --> 14:54.400
I never know what to say.       

14:54.400 --> 14:55.700
  Hi. This is Sam from Cheers.  

14:55.800 --> 14:57.200
Uh, this message is for Rebecca.

14:57.200 --> 14:59.000
        Um, hi, Rebecca.        

14:59.100 --> 15:00.800
We just wanted to find out      
        if you're okay,         

15:00.900 --> 15:02.200
          and tell you          
     that we all miss you,      

15:02.200 --> 15:03.800
        and I love you,         
    and I hope that...          

15:03.800 --> 15:05.500
                 Oh, oh, Sam.   
         Wh-What?               

15:05.600 --> 15:07.100
                You love her?   

15:07.200 --> 15:09.600
  No. No, I-I didn't say that.  

15:09.600 --> 15:11.500
    Hold on a second.           
     No, I didn't say that.     

15:13.800 --> 15:16.400
     No, no, I said-I said      
  we miss her and we love her.  

15:16.400 --> 15:17.900
            You said we miss her
            and you love her.   

15:18.000 --> 15:20.500
Yeah, but it was implied        
that you miss her, too.         

15:21.300 --> 15:22.800
          Well, shoot.          

15:22.900 --> 15:25.200
  I-I-I don't want her to get   
the wrong impression here.      

15:25.300 --> 15:27.600
    Uh, hi, Rebecca, listen,    
  when I said that I love you,  

15:27.700 --> 15:29.400
     you know I didn't mean     
        love love.              

15:29.500 --> 15:32.800
 I, uh, you know, I meant more  
    like a friend, you know,    

15:32.900 --> 15:35.500
      a buddy, a pal, uh,       
like a partner, you know.       

15:35.600 --> 15:38.300
    Like the two cops           
     in <i>David Copperfield.</i>      

15:39.400 --> 15:41.800
Okay, honey?                    

15:41.800 --> 15:43.100
     Well, anyway, bye-bye.     

15:43.200 --> 15:44.900
                     Wait, no...
Wait, hold on.                  

15:45.000 --> 15:46.200
         That was a little cold.

15:46.200 --> 15:47.400
                 Yeah, you know,

15:47.500 --> 15:48.800
listen, she's, uh,              
she's feeling kind of low.      

15:48.900 --> 15:51.100
You can't just kick her         
when she's down like that.      
                      Yeah.     

15:53.200 --> 15:56.100
  Sweetheart, when-when I said  
that I love you, you know,      

15:56.200 --> 15:59.000
  I meant that you're a-a very  
important part of my life,      

15:59.100 --> 16:01.300
you know, along with a lot      
        of other people.        

16:01.300 --> 16:04.200
     It-it's, uh, you know,     
      it's like my-my life      

16:04.300 --> 16:05.700
is this big jigsaw puzzle,      

16:05.700 --> 16:07.200
          and you are           
     a very important part.     

16:07.300 --> 16:09.200
        You know,               
like a corner piece, huh?       

16:09.200 --> 16:10.700
        All right.              

16:10.700 --> 16:12.100
Hold on. Oh...                  

16:12.200 --> 16:14.000
  I think the guys want to say  
something here. Go ahead.       

16:14.100 --> 16:16.000
             GUYS:              
        Sammy loves you.        

16:23.600 --> 16:28.100
Hey, any of you guys tried that 
new steak house on Commonwealth?

16:28.100 --> 16:28.900
              No.               

16:29.100 --> 16:30.200
It's the greatest.              

16:30.200 --> 16:32.800
Beautiful waitresses            
in tiny little wench outfits.   

16:32.900 --> 16:34.100
                      Yeah? What
                did you have?   

16:34.200 --> 16:36.900
    Beautiful waitress          
 in a tiny little wench outfit. 

16:37.000 --> 16:39.700
      I'm going back, too.      

16:39.700 --> 16:42.800
Dr. Crane, when are you going   
to read us some more Dickens?   

16:42.900 --> 16:45.100
          (chanting):           
Dickens, Dickens, Dickens.      
LILITH: Oh, well.               

16:46.000 --> 16:48.300
Frasier, I'm impressed.         

16:48.400 --> 16:51.000
It seems your experiment        
in cultural enrichment          

16:51.100 --> 16:52.900
has been a success.             

16:53.000 --> 16:56.300
 Yep. We're waiting for <i>Oliver</i>  
   <i>Twist: The Wrath of Fagin.</i>   

16:57.300 --> 16:59.700
Excuse me?                      

16:59.700 --> 17:03.200
         Darling, I've done some
    things the past few weeks   

17:03.300 --> 17:06.000
          I'm not very proud of.

17:07.400 --> 17:09.599
            Just leave it alone.

17:10.800 --> 17:12.800
Shoot, shoot, shoot.            

17:12.900 --> 17:14.900
Hey, guys...                    

17:15.000 --> 17:16.400
listen to this.                 

17:16.500 --> 17:18.599
        (recorder beeps)        
     Sam, this is Rebecca.      

17:18.700 --> 17:20.200
      I got your message.       

17:20.300 --> 17:21.500
    Hearing your voice          
        made me realize         

17:21.599 --> 17:23.800
        what I'm missing        
    in my life, and...          

17:23.800 --> 17:27.099
     and I was such a fool      
  not to have seen it before.   

17:27.099 --> 17:28.600
         My plane lands         
      at midnight tonight,      

17:28.700 --> 17:30.200
    and I'm coming straight     
     to the bar to see you.     

17:30.300 --> 17:32.200
      So will you please,       
      please wait for me?       

17:32.200 --> 17:33.600
             (beep)             

17:33.700 --> 17:35.500
                    (snickering)

17:37.000 --> 17:39.400
What am I gonna do?             

17:39.500 --> 17:41.600
      I mean, do you think      
  that she's coming back here   

17:41.700 --> 17:43.600
  because I left that message   
        on her machine?         

17:43.700 --> 17:45.800
             Yeah.              

17:45.900 --> 17:47.600
 Hey, will you be serious here  
         for a minute?          

17:47.600 --> 17:49.400
Just once I'd like to have      
a serious conversation          

17:49.400 --> 17:51.400
in this damn bar.               
                     Okay. Fine.
                         Mm-hmm.

17:51.500 --> 17:54.200
      Do you really think       
    that she's rushing back     

17:54.300 --> 17:55.800
because I said I love you?      

17:55.900 --> 17:58.200
        Mm, yeah.               

17:59.200 --> 18:01.300
    What do you know.           

18:01.300 --> 18:03.500
 I'm gonna talk to somebody who 
  knows something around here.  

18:03.600 --> 18:04.900
              What do you think?

18:04.900 --> 18:07.100
You're dead meat                
on a stick.                     

18:08.100 --> 18:09.700
     No, I'm not dead meat      
          on a stick.           

18:09.800 --> 18:11.200
        You know,               
and even if she does think that,

18:11.300 --> 18:13.000
    I've handled lots           
      of love-crazed babes      

18:13.100 --> 18:14.900
    who want to become          
    Mrs. Sam Malone.            

18:15.000 --> 18:17.300
      I got dozens of ways      
    of handling that.           

18:17.400 --> 18:20.000
        You know,               
  even if they all don't work,  

18:20.100 --> 18:22.400
      I still have Plan Z.      

18:24.200 --> 18:25.700
What's, uh,                     
Plan Z there, Sam?              

18:25.800 --> 18:27.600
        Never you mind.         

18:27.600 --> 18:29.300
It's pretty drastic, I'll admit,

18:29.400 --> 18:32.000
 but I'll use it if I have to.  

18:32.100 --> 18:33.800
SAM:                            
I-I...                          

18:33.800 --> 18:35.400
  I don't want the same woman   
        hanging onto me         

18:35.500 --> 18:36.900
    for the rest of my life.    

18:37.000 --> 18:40.000
  I mean, can you imagine how   
 creepy that would be, Frasier? 

18:47.400 --> 18:51.400
             I'll... answer that
          question another time.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.700
            Okay, Leon, you just
              wait outside there

19:02.800 --> 19:04.400
        and come running in when
    you see the lights flash.   

19:04.500 --> 19:05.800
Right.                          

19:05.800 --> 19:07.800
            Carla, Sammy will   
                    not tell us.

19:07.900 --> 19:09.700
            What is this Plan Z?

19:09.800 --> 19:13.000
I'll tell you everything I know 
for 20 bucks each.              

19:13.900 --> 19:16.200
        All right.              

19:20.200 --> 19:23.500
It's called Plan Z.             

19:23.600 --> 19:25.300
When Sammy flashes the lights,  

19:25.400 --> 19:28.300
this guy Leon comes in          
and executes it.                

19:30.500 --> 19:33.300
             Okay, well, what...
                 what <i>is</i> Plan Z?

19:33.400 --> 19:34.500
    Beats me.                   

19:34.500 --> 19:36.300
I didn't know that much         
two minutes ago.                

19:36.300 --> 19:37.700
Give me the money.              

19:46.200 --> 19:47.500
I think it was worth it.        

19:47.600 --> 19:49.500
                Oh, yeah.       

19:52.500 --> 19:54.700
             Sam, it seems to me

19:54.800 --> 19:57.300
  you're going through an awful,
    awful lot of machinations   

19:57.300 --> 19:59.900
    to avoid dealing honestly   
      and directly with Rebecca.

20:00.000 --> 20:03.500
Well, that's me,                
you know, always thinking.      

20:03.500 --> 20:06.400
Besides, you know,              
I don't think we're gonna       
have to use Plan Z here.        

20:06.500 --> 20:07.800
I mean, what are we             
talking about?                  

20:07.900 --> 20:09.000
We're talking about Rebecca.    

20:09.100 --> 20:10.300
I mean, what's                  
the worst she can do?           

20:10.300 --> 20:12.000
              Sam.              

20:12.100 --> 20:13.900
I hope you're ready to change   
your life, because I am.        

20:13.900 --> 20:15.600
                    Ah...       

20:15.600 --> 20:17.600
    Can you excuse me           
    just a second here, hon?    

20:21.800 --> 20:23.000
Sam, why are you flashing       
          the lights?           

20:23.000 --> 20:25.200
Oh, you know, it's just kind of 
      to welcome you back.      

20:25.300 --> 20:27.300
  You know like, three cheers,  
      hey, Rebecca's back.      

20:27.300 --> 20:29.300
        Rebecca's back.         

20:30.100 --> 20:31.600
REBECCA:                        
Sam,                            

20:31.600 --> 20:33.100
         get over here,         
    quit being silly.           

20:33.100 --> 20:34.600
  I have to ask you something   
    really important.           

20:37.100 --> 20:39.500
      Will you sell me this bar?

20:39.500 --> 20:41.200
    No. What?                   

20:41.300 --> 20:42.600
  Cheers-- I want to buy Cheers.

20:42.600 --> 20:45.200
 Running this place was the only
 time I ever felt like somebody.

20:45.300 --> 20:47.000
                You know, people
                looked up to me.

20:47.100 --> 20:48.500
        Who?                    

20:52.000 --> 20:54.100
You mean you didn't come        
back here to marry Sam?         

20:54.200 --> 20:55.300
                  Marry Sam?!   

20:55.400 --> 20:57.300
                No, why would   
                 you think that?

20:57.400 --> 20:58.600
You didn't think that, did you? 

20:58.700 --> 21:01.500
        Shoot, no.              

21:01.500 --> 21:03.900
    That's why you've been doing
        all this weird stuff.   

21:04.000 --> 21:06.300
        Because you think I came
         back here to marry you?

21:06.400 --> 21:08.000
    What weird stuff?           

21:08.900 --> 21:11.500
I can't keep                    
living a lie, Sam.              

21:11.500 --> 21:13.500
         No, no, no, Leon.      

21:21.100 --> 21:24.300
Sam is my lover.                

21:24.300 --> 21:26.300
          Boy, you...           

21:26.400 --> 21:29.900
      you really <i>did</i> think      
        I was after you.        

21:30.000 --> 21:32.100
                        REBECCA:
        I can't believe this.   

21:32.100 --> 21:34.300
     You are a wussy little     
          fraidy cat.           

21:34.300 --> 21:37.000
              I'm not a wussy   
            little fraidy cat.  

21:37.100 --> 21:38.500
     Oh, then this is real?     

21:38.500 --> 21:41.300
                    You and Leon
                     are lovers.

21:41.400 --> 21:44.200
        Well, why don't you give
            Leon a kiss then?   

21:47.900 --> 21:49.800
              Because we've been
          together for 14 years,

21:49.900 --> 21:51.900
             and we're no longer
                  demonstrative.

21:57.500 --> 21:58.900
              You know, the, uh,
            the spark's gone.   

21:58.900 --> 22:00.600
                I'm sorry, Leon.

22:00.600 --> 22:03.300
          I probably should have
          said something sooner.

22:03.300 --> 22:05.800
        No, no, no, Sam,        
  you can't have it both ways.  

22:05.900 --> 22:09.200
 You either give Leon a kiss... 

22:09.300 --> 22:11.200
         on his lips...         

22:11.300 --> 22:13.500
                    or you admit
                    that you are

22:13.600 --> 22:15.500
      a wussy little fraidy cat.

22:15.600 --> 22:17.200
Sammy, don't let her            
make you look like              

22:17.300 --> 22:19.400
a wussy little fraidy cat.      

22:19.500 --> 22:21.100
        I'm not a wussy         
    little fraidy cat.          

22:21.200 --> 22:22.700
        (Carla meowing)         

22:22.800 --> 22:24.000
What are we                     
supposed to think?              

22:30.500 --> 22:33.000
         Sorry about that, Leon.

22:33.100 --> 22:35.900
You realize I'm gonna have      
to slug you in the face now.    

22:36.000 --> 22:37.700
            I wish you would.   

22:37.800 --> 22:40.500
                 (Cliff and Norm
                    groaning)   

22:40.500 --> 22:42.300
We, uh, still on for golf       
          on Thursday?          

22:42.400 --> 22:43.600
Yeah, you bet, Leon.            

22:43.600 --> 22:45.500
             Great.             

22:46.800 --> 22:48.300
Oh, ow...                       

22:48.400 --> 22:49.500
That hurt.                      

22:49.600 --> 22:51.000
      Sammy, look at you.       

22:51.000 --> 22:52.300
          Your nose is bleeding.

22:52.400 --> 22:53.900
                     Your eye is
              starting to swell.

22:54.000 --> 22:55.900
      And you just kissed a man.

22:58.300 --> 23:00.900
          But you're not a wussy
              little fraidy cat.

23:01.000 --> 23:03.200
             NORM:              
    You ain't afraid.           
                  No, not Sammy.

23:03.300 --> 23:04.400
                        NORM:   
                    Good boy.   

23:04.500 --> 23:05.700
          Good, Sam.            
                    You know,   

23:05.800 --> 23:07.900
          in the space          
    of the last 30 seconds,     

23:08.000 --> 23:11.600
we have witnessed deceit,       
         sexual turmoil         

23:11.700 --> 23:13.900
                     and sudden,
             senseless violence.

23:13.900 --> 23:17.200
    It puts me in mind          
      of a passage from...      

23:17.200 --> 23:19.500
      <i>The Pickwick Papers.</i>
