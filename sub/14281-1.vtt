WEBVTT

02:42.240 --> 02:43.360
What did you do? Steal?

02:49.200 --> 02:50.440
Then why are you sitting here?

02:52.120 --> 02:54.680
Madam, I cannot handle
this old man anymore.

02:54.760 --> 02:55.920
He's here again.

02:57.920 --> 02:59.680
-You go, I'll take care of it.
-Okay, madam.

03:00.960 --> 03:02.720
Look, the bitch is coming.

03:06.760 --> 03:07.640
Let's go there.

03:13.080 --> 03:13.960
How are you?

03:15.480 --> 03:16.360
Same.

03:18.520 --> 03:19.400
Did you find anything?

03:22.280 --> 03:23.280
For the past eight years,

03:23.360 --> 03:25.560
you've been asking
the same question every day.

03:27.200 --> 03:28.760
I don't have anything else to ask.

03:36.520 --> 03:38.240
What's the point of coming here every day?

03:39.560 --> 03:41.040
I will inform you if I find anything.

03:42.040 --> 03:44.720
Instead of spending your time
with your beautiful wife,

03:45.640 --> 03:47.840
you're wasting your time here.

03:50.800 --> 03:52.600
I come here for my wife.

03:55.200 --> 03:59.040
Unless I visit the police station
once a day,

04:00.160 --> 04:01.760
she doesn't feel at peace.

04:06.480 --> 04:08.880
Okay, you go home now, John Uncle.

04:10.600 --> 04:13.520
I will let you know
as soon as I find something.

04:15.720 --> 04:16.640
Okay.

04:19.080 --> 04:20.280
I'll come back tomorrow, then.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.120
Oh, God!

05:58.960 --> 06:01.160
John, what have you made?

06:01.640 --> 06:03.600
I don't know what it's called,
saw it on TV.

06:04.640 --> 06:06.880
You remember the recipe,
but you don't remember the name?

06:07.080 --> 06:08.000
Really?

06:08.360 --> 06:10.200
There's always another way to find out.

06:14.120 --> 06:16.600
Looks like you remember
only half the recipe.

06:24.200 --> 06:26.640
It seems I've invented a new dish.

06:28.320 --> 06:29.600
Have you paid the bills, John?

06:30.600 --> 06:31.880
They had sent a message.

06:33.000 --> 06:33.840
No.

06:35.560 --> 06:38.960
It was too late by the time
I left the police station.

06:39.760 --> 06:40.640
I'll do it tomorrow.

06:44.360 --> 06:46.040
You remember to go
to the police station...

06:46.840 --> 06:48.120
but not the household chores.

06:49.800 --> 06:52.200
How long will you keep
going to the police station?

06:54.040 --> 06:55.800
How long will you keep
sitting there all day?

06:57.960 --> 06:59.120
When will this all end?

07:00.760 --> 07:02.120
Until I get justice.

07:05.240 --> 07:08.440
<i>The sound of your laughter</i>
<i>Like a xylophone</i>

07:11.160 --> 07:14.040
<i>I hear it even today</i>

07:17.520 --> 07:20.960
<i>Your fragrance lingers on</i>

07:21.800 --> 07:25.920
<i>Though you're long gone</i>

07:29.800 --> 07:33.280
<i>Your place in the house</i>

07:36.000 --> 07:39.440
<i>Your empty bed</i>

07:41.720 --> 07:45.640
<i>I sense you everywhere</i>

07:46.360 --> 07:50.240
<i>Despite your absence</i>

07:52.440 --> 07:56.560
<i>Why</i>
<i>Oh why?</i>

07:58.560 --> 08:03.080
<i>Why did you leave me alone?</i>

08:04.920 --> 08:08.400
<i>Why</i>
<i>Oh why?</i>

08:11.320 --> 08:17.240
<i>The shards of memories</i>
<i>Are all that remain</i>

08:17.440 --> 08:20.200
We don't want the police here. You can go.

08:20.720 --> 08:22.160
Please come. Please come with me.

08:22.520 --> 08:23.440
Come.

08:24.920 --> 08:25.800
All this...

08:26.560 --> 08:28.080
All this is their fault!

08:31.440 --> 08:32.560
It's your fault.

08:34.400 --> 08:35.480
Stop this charade.

08:36.800 --> 08:39.280
If you loved her so much,
then you should've taken care of her.

08:40.240 --> 08:43.600
The reason my daughter is dead
is because of you, John.

08:44.240 --> 08:45.960
Only your fault.

08:50.120 --> 08:55.680
<i>I continue to keep</i>
<i>Your things in their place</i>

08:56.240 --> 09:01.360
<i>In silence I stare at them</i>

09:02.440 --> 09:07.520
<i>I'll wait for your return</i>

09:08.600 --> 09:13.120
<i>Nothing more that I can do</i>

09:15.080 --> 09:17.720
<i>Let me untangle once again</i>

09:18.200 --> 09:23.800
<i>Your curly locks of hair. </i>

09:23.880 --> 09:27.200
I was going to get this earlier.

09:29.440 --> 09:33.720
I troubled your grandma
to finish this quickly.

09:35.480 --> 09:38.240
Our Angela is growing up pretty fast.

09:39.760 --> 09:43.760
<i>Why</i>
<i>Oh why?</i>

09:44.560 --> 09:46.080
I'll take the old one back.

09:46.160 --> 09:52.720
<i>The shards of memories</i>
<i>Are all that remain</i>

09:59.600 --> 10:00.880
We love you, sweetheart.

10:06.120 --> 10:07.160
And we miss you.

10:27.400 --> 10:28.520
-Hello.
-Hello.

10:28.680 --> 10:30.400
-Can you please call him.
-Who? Martin?

10:30.680 --> 10:31.600
Sure.

10:33.320 --> 10:35.760
Lord, we expect your blessings.

10:36.040 --> 10:36.920
Father...

10:38.720 --> 10:39.560
One minute.

10:43.080 --> 10:46.560
Lord, we expect your blessings.

10:48.440 --> 10:51.160
And request that the departed soul--

10:51.240 --> 10:53.000
Father, I am getting married.

10:53.600 --> 10:54.560
It's not a funeral.

10:54.800 --> 10:55.880
Doesn't make a difference.

10:56.880 --> 11:00.120
-There is not much of a difference.
-What?

11:00.800 --> 11:02.440
Soon you will realize that.

11:04.080 --> 11:06.520
Take a good look at her and imagine

11:07.520 --> 11:09.120
how will she look when she grows old,

11:09.880 --> 11:11.640
If you're okay with it, I'll go ahead.

11:12.720 --> 11:14.880
I've decided father. I do.

11:15.960 --> 11:17.200
It was my duty to warn you.

11:17.840 --> 11:20.280
-Kaveri Paul...
-Yes.

11:26.400 --> 11:30.560
John Uncle, I am sorry,
he can't meet you today.

11:30.840 --> 11:33.520
He had to leave urgently.

11:39.040 --> 11:40.840
Go inside and tell him,

11:41.680 --> 11:45.760
just by changing uniforms
a policeman cannot become a priest.

11:47.720 --> 11:50.880
If he was a real priest, he wouldn't
have stood inside a church

11:50.960 --> 11:52.800
and asked you to lie to me.

12:21.080 --> 12:24.640
<i>Grandpa... Grandpa...</i>
<i>I am sorry, grandpa.</i>

12:25.520 --> 12:29.160
<i>I made a mistake.</i>
<i>I should have listened to you...</i>

12:29.240 --> 12:36.160
<i>I should have listened to you...</i>
<i>I should have listened to you...</i>

12:50.240 --> 12:52.440
<i>I should have listened to you.</i>

12:52.520 --> 12:55.760
<i>I shouldn't have taken the other route.</i>

13:26.280 --> 13:29.000
She was last seen in her school uniform,
with a cap on her head.

13:29.080 --> 13:29.920
Understand?

13:30.480 --> 13:33.120
During the afternoons,
Ripon Street is almost empty.

13:34.680 --> 13:36.760
At around 2:00 p.m.
she was abducted from there.

13:36.840 --> 13:39.720
There was an eye-witness
who saw that black van.

14:19.440 --> 14:20.760
-Who is it?
-Martin.

14:39.920 --> 14:42.240
-How are you?
-Fine.

14:42.320 --> 14:44.200
I hope John is giving you
the medicines on time?

14:44.280 --> 14:45.640
What brings you here today?

14:45.800 --> 14:47.680
Where is that crazy guy.
I don't see him here.

14:48.200 --> 14:49.160
He's gone to the market.

14:50.600 --> 14:51.840
Listen... Listen...

14:53.440 --> 14:55.360
Do I look like a fool?

14:56.120 --> 14:58.440
Last week,
I bought the same fish from you.

14:58.520 --> 15:00.280
How can it suddenly become so expensive?

15:00.440 --> 15:02.800
Sir, the elections are round the corner.

15:02.880 --> 15:05.920
Thats why the party workers
are distributing fish amongst the people.

15:06.680 --> 15:07.760
So the prices have soared.

15:10.320 --> 15:11.240
Last week you had said

15:11.320 --> 15:13.880
the prawns have became expensive
due to the earthquake in Japan.

15:13.960 --> 15:15.960
What can I do?
I didn't cause the earthquake.

15:16.040 --> 15:17.880
-Rubbish!
-Hey, uncle. Listen...

15:17.960 --> 15:20.040
-How many kilograms do you want?
-I don't want any.

15:20.120 --> 15:22.200
Now I'll only eat fish
after the elections are over.

15:39.400 --> 15:41.800
Last evening your husband had come
to meet me at the church.

15:43.440 --> 15:45.240
And he left behind
half a kilogram of guilt.

15:45.800 --> 15:48.000
Couldn't sleep all night.
Kept thinking about it...

15:48.560 --> 15:49.400
So I came here.

15:49.800 --> 15:51.920
So you managed to dodge him again?

15:52.160 --> 15:53.920
I had to literally sneak away.

15:59.600 --> 16:00.480
What happened?

16:01.480 --> 16:05.080
-Even John makes better tea than this.
-Yes, but this...

16:06.640 --> 16:08.000
Something is wrong with the milk.

16:08.360 --> 16:10.200
-Who bought it? John?
-Yes.

16:10.440 --> 16:11.280
No wonder.

16:19.920 --> 16:24.200
Martin, John needs your help.

16:26.520 --> 16:29.800
He keeps listening to the same tape
every night, over and over again.

16:31.120 --> 16:34.560
He thinks I am asleep,
and I don't know anything.

16:37.960 --> 16:38.880
Please.

16:49.240 --> 16:52.560
<i>No, no, no. </i>
<i>Angela, you didn't make any mistake.</i>

16:52.920 --> 16:55.240
<i>You will be fine. </i>
<i>You will be fine, dear!</i>

16:55.640 --> 16:56.880
<i>Grandpa! Grandpa!</i>

16:57.840 --> 16:58.880
<i>Are you assured now?</i>

16:58.960 --> 17:01.280
<i>I will tell you where</i>
<i>to bring the money.</i>

17:01.360 --> 17:04.840
<i>I will tell you.</i>

17:04.920 --> 17:07.440
<i>I will tell you.</i>

17:07.520 --> 17:11.080
<i>I will tell you.</i>

17:20.200 --> 17:23.080
I will talk to him.

17:32.720 --> 17:35.000
Sweetie, where did you get this cap from?

17:37.720 --> 17:39.920
This... This cap?

17:40.680 --> 17:41.560
Who gave it to you?

18:43.920 --> 18:45.720
Who is this?

18:47.680 --> 18:50.320
Excuse me, sir.
I don't want to disturb you.

18:51.240 --> 18:54.800
I just want to know
from where did the girl get the cap?

18:56.400 --> 18:58.120
-It belongs to her.
-No, this...

18:59.200 --> 19:03.760
Sir. Sir... That's not her cap.

19:04.760 --> 19:06.160
My wife made that cap.

19:07.200 --> 19:08.160
My wife made this...

19:12.960 --> 19:15.440
Isn't it illegal to make them
work like this?

19:16.760 --> 19:17.720
The cap was donated.

19:17.920 --> 19:20.360
-Who... Who donated it?
-How would I know.

19:20.440 --> 19:21.960
You must have some records.

19:22.040 --> 19:23.760
Maybe, but I don't have the time for that.

19:23.840 --> 19:26.160
Please, it's very important.
It's really very important.

19:26.240 --> 19:27.760
Please leave, I've other things to do.

19:27.840 --> 19:30.080
If you want I can make
a donation to the orphanage.

19:34.600 --> 19:35.440
Here you go.

19:35.760 --> 19:37.440
-We got it from Imambara.
-Huh?

19:38.240 --> 19:39.480
Imambara. Imambara.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.840
The one in Hooghly?

19:44.160 --> 19:46.440
How much are you going to donate, huh?

20:12.480 --> 20:13.840
Where were you, John?

20:15.480 --> 20:17.080
The fan has stopped working again.

20:31.840 --> 20:34.080
-Where are the groceries?
-Huh?

20:34.560 --> 20:36.640
Where are the groceries?

20:42.680 --> 20:43.520
I forgot.

20:44.200 --> 20:47.360
-Are you all right?
-Yeah. Yeah.

20:51.280 --> 20:52.200
Oh, God...

20:53.080 --> 20:54.040
John?

20:55.120 --> 20:58.280
Father Martin had come
to see you in the morning.

20:59.240 --> 21:00.280
Yeah. Yeah.

21:06.480 --> 21:07.480
How are you, John?

21:09.720 --> 21:10.600
Won't you come inside?

21:11.320 --> 21:16.040
I seek justice from the law, not God.

21:16.840 --> 21:18.160
This... This...

21:18.960 --> 21:20.960
It's the same cap.

21:21.920 --> 21:23.720
She was wearing this
when she was kidnapped.

21:24.280 --> 21:25.160
Look...

21:25.600 --> 21:26.840
A... R...

21:27.640 --> 21:28.920
Angela Roy.

21:29.160 --> 21:31.600
-Where did you--
-A little girl from the...

21:32.040 --> 21:35.200
Little Flowers Deaf'n'Dumb
Orphanage was wearing it.

21:37.320 --> 21:39.320
You know the Imambara at Hooghly?

21:39.680 --> 21:41.320
It was donated to the orphanage by them.

21:42.360 --> 21:44.560
How did it get there?
Who gave it to them?

21:45.560 --> 21:47.240
We must follow this trail?

21:48.000 --> 21:49.280
We can find the kidnapper.

21:50.840 --> 21:53.120
John, it's been eight years.

21:54.680 --> 21:55.720
Forget about all this.

21:56.600 --> 21:59.040
And find another way to attain peace.

21:59.120 --> 22:00.000
Martin. Martin.

22:00.520 --> 22:01.440
This...

22:11.240 --> 22:13.520
I am not going to run away
from the situation like you,

22:14.360 --> 22:15.720
Inspector Martin.

22:17.880 --> 22:19.960
You are trying to shy away
from your responsibilities

22:20.040 --> 22:21.520
by becoming a priest now.

22:22.960 --> 22:25.440
You're only trying to hide
behind those white robes.

22:28.840 --> 22:30.040
You had promised me.

22:31.560 --> 22:33.280
You forgot, but I didn't.

22:39.680 --> 22:41.000
You always fail to understand.

22:41.080 --> 22:42.520
That crime was never repeated again.

22:43.120 --> 22:45.800
Criminals can change their location
but not their habits.

22:45.880 --> 22:47.200
I am sure he left the city.

22:47.680 --> 22:49.680
It's almost impossible to find him.

22:56.760 --> 22:59.000
My heart says,
I'll surely find something with this.

22:59.080 --> 23:01.280
"I will get justice?"
How will you get justice?

23:01.440 --> 23:03.040
For that we need to get to the Imambara.

23:03.120 --> 23:05.160
Your scooter is a piece of junk.
How about my bike?

23:09.600 --> 23:12.480
Do you have any information about
who to speak with at the Imambara?

23:12.560 --> 23:13.400
No.

23:41.800 --> 23:42.680
Yes.

23:43.160 --> 23:46.040
Little Flowers Orphanage.

23:47.960 --> 23:49.480
Yes, here it is.

23:50.280 --> 23:52.280
We had sent them these items.

23:53.160 --> 23:57.280
<i>In the month of December,</i>
<i>the graveyard wall was extended.</i>

23:57.680 --> 24:01.880
<i>We found an aluminum box,</i>
<i>during the dig that time.</i>

24:02.840 --> 24:06.840
<i>And this cap was one of the items </i>
<i>we found in it.</i>

24:07.800 --> 24:09.320
Was there anything else in that trunk?

24:10.240 --> 24:11.440
I don't remember clearly.

24:11.520 --> 24:14.640
Items that were still usable
were donated to the orphanage

24:14.840 --> 24:17.280
and other items were thrown away.

24:18.320 --> 24:20.880
God knows since how long
it was lying there.

24:22.520 --> 24:23.360
Since eight years!

24:24.080 --> 24:25.680
-How do you know?
-Thanks for your help.

24:26.040 --> 24:28.640
No, no, wait... We need some more help.

24:29.400 --> 24:34.960
Can you show me the exact spot
where you found this trunk?

24:35.920 --> 24:38.880
We might find something buried there.

24:39.640 --> 24:41.480
Now there are only graves there.

24:41.560 --> 24:44.680
Only dead bodies buried in. Nothing more.

24:45.760 --> 24:49.520
Before it became a part of the Imambara,

24:50.480 --> 24:51.800
who did this land belong to?

24:53.000 --> 24:54.360
I'll have to check the records.

25:11.560 --> 25:14.720
Uncle John, what are you doing here?

25:15.200 --> 25:16.080
Yes, just...

25:16.160 --> 25:18.080
Still looking for a property
for your son-in-law?

25:18.160 --> 25:21.400
We needed some information
about the Shah family.

25:21.920 --> 25:24.320
But they are settled in USA.
It's been more than 25 years.

25:24.760 --> 25:27.040
I do the running around
and handle all their paperwork.

25:27.240 --> 25:28.920
It's not easy to deal with the NRIs.

25:29.200 --> 25:33.160
But we heard that they donated
a part of their property to the Imambara.

25:33.240 --> 25:34.440
-Yes, they did.
-So?

25:34.640 --> 25:36.680
That's why Mr. Shah
himself had came here last year.

25:37.040 --> 25:38.600
He donated the land to the Imambara

25:38.760 --> 25:39.880
and gave this job to me.

25:41.480 --> 25:45.080
Eight years ago, in October...

25:46.280 --> 25:48.320
-Was anyone from his family here?
-No.

25:49.600 --> 25:50.440
There was no one.

26:00.920 --> 26:04.600
<i>O ferryman!</i>

26:07.120 --> 26:10.120
<i>O ferryman!</i>

26:14.040 --> 26:19.000
<i>O benevolent ferryman!</i>

26:23.360 --> 26:25.520
<i>To which shore</i>

26:25.600 --> 26:30.600
<i>Are you taking your boat?</i>

26:33.600 --> 26:37.520
<i>O benevolent ferryman!</i>

26:41.760 --> 26:44.320
<i>To which shore</i>

26:44.400 --> 26:49.400
<i>Are you taking your boat?</i>

26:51.240 --> 26:53.280
<i>To which shore</i>

26:53.600 --> 26:58.800
<i>Are you taking your boat?</i>

27:17.160 --> 27:18.880
You must start coming to the church again.

27:19.200 --> 27:20.760
Instead of clawing at your wounds,

27:21.720 --> 27:23.120
find a way to heal them.

27:24.280 --> 27:26.680
Did your wounds heal, Father Martin?

27:34.720 --> 27:40.040
<i>It's common belief that life</i>
<i>Is nothing but few lines of fate</i>

27:40.880 --> 27:45.640
<i>I am unfortunate</i>
<i>To have witnessed this day</i>

27:47.400 --> 27:51.840
<i>The many dreams I had for you</i>

27:53.240 --> 27:57.880
<i>How do I let go of them?</i>

27:59.600 --> 28:05.400
<i>Gasps of anguish escape my aging heart</i>

28:05.880 --> 28:11.760
<i>For the many unfulfilled desires</i>

28:11.840 --> 28:15.920
<i>Why</i>
<i>Oh why?</i>

28:17.960 --> 28:22.560
<i>Why did you leave me alone?</i>

28:24.320 --> 28:28.280
<i>Why</i>
<i>Oh why?</i>

28:30.720 --> 28:37.280
<i>The shards of memories</i>
<i>Are all that remain</i>

29:19.760 --> 29:22.200
Mom! Mom! Open the door, mom!

29:22.280 --> 29:24.520
-Mom! Open the door!
-What happened? What happened?

29:24.720 --> 29:25.800
He was coming to catch me.

29:27.560 --> 29:29.800
Come on, come on, grandpa.
You can do it. Come on.

29:30.920 --> 29:33.480
Yes. Yes. Goal.

29:33.680 --> 29:34.600
Oh, no.

29:36.440 --> 29:37.560
Come on, Ronnie. Once again.

29:37.640 --> 29:39.880
No, grandpa. You don't know how to play.

29:40.120 --> 29:41.720
Can I go play on the ground?

29:41.800 --> 29:43.640
No, play here. Not on the ground.

29:43.720 --> 29:44.600
Okay.

29:51.200 --> 29:52.040
Hello.

30:25.320 --> 30:26.200
Ronnie!

30:28.320 --> 30:29.160
Ronnie!

30:34.880 --> 30:35.760
Hello.

30:37.600 --> 30:38.440
What?

30:39.400 --> 30:40.280
Who's speaking?

31:01.480 --> 31:04.560
<i>I was playing football</i>
<i>with my grandson there</i>

31:04.640 --> 31:05.960
<i>right where the car is parked.</i>

31:06.280 --> 31:08.440
<i>Just then my landline started ringing.</i>

31:09.000 --> 31:11.080
<i>I came upstairs to answer the phone.</i>

31:11.560 --> 31:15.080
<i>But by the time I could answer,</i>
<i>the call got disconnected.</i>

31:15.560 --> 31:18.400
<i>After that when I went down,</i>
<i>I couldn't see Ronnie anywhere.</i>

31:19.160 --> 31:20.760
I called for him, but...

31:23.000 --> 31:23.840
Neeta.

31:24.680 --> 31:26.920
After that, I received a call
on my mobile phone.

31:27.400 --> 31:29.000
I don't know who he was, but he said...

31:29.680 --> 31:32.360
"If you want Ronnie back,
then do as I say."

31:33.560 --> 31:36.400
-Neeta, no...
-Why him, papa?

31:36.480 --> 31:38.480
-No, dear. You will fall sick.
-Why him?

31:43.080 --> 31:43.920
Found anything?

31:45.120 --> 31:46.720
The call was made from a prepaid number.

31:48.440 --> 31:50.240
Tell the service provider
to track the number.

31:50.320 --> 31:51.200
Sure.

31:57.360 --> 31:59.080
<i>-Send it to all the stations.</i>
-Yes.

31:59.280 --> 32:00.160
One minute.

32:00.440 --> 32:01.400
-Yeah.
-Done.

32:03.880 --> 32:04.800
Mr. Sinha.

32:10.120 --> 32:11.200
He may call again.

32:11.400 --> 32:13.760
We're tapping your calls on the mobile,
even your landline.

32:14.280 --> 32:15.120
Thank you.

32:16.160 --> 32:17.480
But what is your plan?

32:18.280 --> 32:20.360
Is there a threat
to Ronnie's life if you stay here?

32:21.360 --> 32:24.240
What if the kidnapper finds out
that I've informed the police,

32:24.320 --> 32:25.920
then, he might do something.

32:27.040 --> 32:29.840
If you want to save the child,
then the police are your only hope.

32:34.600 --> 32:38.320
I need details
of the kidnapping reported last week.

32:38.560 --> 32:39.880
-Immediately.
-Okay, madam.

32:41.240 --> 32:42.080
And listen...

32:43.720 --> 32:45.640
I also want the case files of John Biswas.

32:46.960 --> 32:48.720
The eight-year-old kidnapping case.

32:49.760 --> 32:50.640
Okay, madam.

32:52.920 --> 32:55.200
I am deeply shocked about his death.

32:55.480 --> 32:57.160
May the almighty grant him salvation.

32:57.240 --> 32:58.840
That's all I can say.

32:58.960 --> 33:00.160
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

33:03.560 --> 33:06.480
Sir, if I couldn't remember
anything yesterday

33:06.560 --> 33:08.520
how can you expect
a miracle to happen today?

33:09.000 --> 33:11.080
What's the point in coming here every day?

33:11.440 --> 33:15.920
This is the first clue in eight years.

33:16.920 --> 33:19.040
I can't ignore it so easily.

33:19.840 --> 33:21.000
Yes.

33:50.840 --> 33:51.800
What are you doing here?

33:54.040 --> 33:54.880
Getting married.

33:57.400 --> 33:58.280
Soon.

33:58.760 --> 33:59.600
What?

34:04.360 --> 34:07.200
That's bad news... I mean big news.

34:07.400 --> 34:08.600
Why do you look so surprised?

34:09.680 --> 34:13.680
-I am not that bad looking.
-No, I mean...

34:15.200 --> 34:16.320
You are...

34:18.400 --> 34:19.440
I am what, Father?

34:23.400 --> 34:24.600
I mean, you are...

34:25.560 --> 34:26.480
Come on, Father.

34:27.600 --> 34:28.760
Say what's on your mind.

34:31.040 --> 34:34.600
There's no one here except for you,
me and God.

34:37.920 --> 34:39.240
Are you really getting married?

34:44.160 --> 34:45.000
No.

34:53.200 --> 34:54.520
A child has been kidnapped.

35:13.680 --> 35:14.560
What now?

35:15.320 --> 35:17.080
-Please get back to your work.
-Yes, sir.

35:17.880 --> 35:20.040
My scooter is giving me some trouble.

35:20.120 --> 35:21.960
Do you have a spare wire or something?

35:22.800 --> 35:24.920
The spark plug has got choked,
I'll have to clean it.

35:26.200 --> 35:30.480
Sometimes, it gives me trouble.
Otherwise it flies like an airplane.

35:31.680 --> 35:32.960
-Wait here, I will check.
-Sure.

35:35.840 --> 35:38.920
What happened eight years ago
is happening again.

35:39.440 --> 35:41.080
What's the connection after eight years?

35:41.400 --> 35:44.560
You're thinking in the wrong direction.
Both the cases are completely different.

35:44.640 --> 35:47.320
Think about it.
You couldn't catch him last time.

35:47.760 --> 35:49.880
So this time he's giving you
another opportunity.

35:51.480 --> 35:52.680
I don't want a second chance.

35:52.960 --> 35:53.840
Thank you very much.

35:54.720 --> 35:56.680
Even to tell him that,
you've to catch him first.

36:01.400 --> 36:02.400
Please help me.

36:03.640 --> 36:06.160
I've never dealt with
a kidnapping case before.

36:07.080 --> 36:08.560
And you have been an expert on this.

36:09.640 --> 36:11.040
Was that a joke or a taunt?

36:12.480 --> 36:13.520
I am asking for your help.

36:14.000 --> 36:17.000
You can take all the help
from the old case files.

36:17.240 --> 36:19.000
I came here because
I have already read them.

36:19.080 --> 36:20.240
What's your problem, Martin?

36:23.280 --> 36:24.160
Sorry.

36:25.000 --> 36:25.840
Father Martin.

36:28.040 --> 36:30.520
There's no harm if you read
the current case file once.

36:30.600 --> 36:31.920
I've forgotten everything.

36:32.000 --> 36:33.920
-That's why...
-Leave everything to God...

36:35.720 --> 36:38.160
We try to give ourselves undue importance.

36:40.960 --> 36:45.400
I see. So now that's
the solution to all your problems.

36:48.000 --> 36:51.000
Those who can't help themselves,
can never be of any help to God.

36:52.280 --> 36:53.400
Now it's God's turn.

36:54.560 --> 36:56.760
You've already disappointed everyone else.

36:57.720 --> 36:59.920
John, the police department...

37:02.280 --> 37:03.160
and me.

37:15.920 --> 37:17.920
See, maybe you can find
something useful in this.

37:18.720 --> 37:20.240
Thank you. Thank you.

37:34.680 --> 37:39.440
Thank you. It's fixed.
Thanks to this pen and this wire.

37:39.520 --> 37:40.720
-Great.
-My job's done.

37:40.800 --> 37:43.120
Thank you. Thank you.

37:51.720 --> 37:52.560
Sir.

37:52.640 --> 37:54.280
Wait, wait, sir. Wait.

37:55.000 --> 37:55.880
Wait.

37:56.560 --> 37:59.120
It took two months,
but finally a miracle has happened.

37:59.440 --> 38:02.280
This incident reminded me
of something else.

38:02.440 --> 38:03.640
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

38:04.880 --> 38:06.320
This pen was in that trunk as well.

38:06.600 --> 38:08.080
It completely slipped out of my mind.

38:08.520 --> 38:09.400
Look.

38:15.160 --> 38:16.080
Madam.

38:19.480 --> 38:20.840
We can't find her father.

38:22.560 --> 38:23.440
Let him be.

38:24.040 --> 38:26.560
Maybe he doesn't want to talk
to the kidnapper in front of us.

38:26.920 --> 38:29.600
He's concerned
about Ronnie's safety. So...

38:34.440 --> 38:36.360
Father Martin. You?

38:36.560 --> 38:38.400
How did you leave God alone today?

38:40.200 --> 38:42.880
Sister... Sister...
What happened? Sister...

38:43.960 --> 38:46.680
She had a heart surgery many years ago.

38:46.760 --> 38:49.120
Her heart is weak.
She can't handle too much stress.

38:49.200 --> 38:50.600
-Call the doctor.
-Yes, madam.

38:51.800 --> 38:52.640
Careful.

38:54.280 --> 38:55.240
Give her some water.

38:55.320 --> 38:56.640
Where's her husband?

38:58.120 --> 39:00.160
In the army.
He's posted in the north-east.

39:01.160 --> 39:03.720
He's been informed
and will be here by evening.

39:04.360 --> 39:06.120
But madam,
what if the kidnapper calls now?

39:07.040 --> 39:08.960
I'll pretend to be
the mother and talk to him.

39:09.040 --> 39:10.520
Yes, what if he finds--

39:10.600 --> 39:12.920
If he finds out that
I am not the mother,

39:13.640 --> 39:17.600
then we'll know that
he knows the family really well.

39:22.240 --> 39:23.280
But why isn't he calling?

40:01.760 --> 40:02.640
Hello.

40:03.040 --> 40:04.280
<i>Grandpa, help!</i>

40:04.720 --> 40:07.160
-Ronnie. How are you, son?
<i>-Please save me.</i>

40:07.240 --> 40:08.920
Grandpa won't let anything happen to you.

40:09.360 --> 40:10.200
Just don't worry.

40:10.280 --> 40:11.240
<i>Grandpa, help...</i>

41:30.560 --> 41:31.440
Hello.

41:31.520 --> 41:33.080
<i>Why did you call the police?</i>

41:33.400 --> 41:36.560
<i>Your grandchild is in my custody.</i>
<i>So stop wasting my time.</i>

41:36.640 --> 41:39.680
<i>If you want him back alive, then arrange</i>
<i>for two million by tomorrow morning.</i>

41:39.760 --> 41:40.880
<i>I will call again.</i>

41:41.440 --> 41:43.680
Hello, I am his mother speaking.

41:44.200 --> 41:45.160
Is my son all right?

41:46.200 --> 41:47.640
I want evidence that he's all right.

41:49.600 --> 41:50.480
Hello... Hello...

41:54.520 --> 41:55.360
Find anything?

41:55.720 --> 41:57.200
No, madam. We had very little time.

41:58.360 --> 42:02.920
But yes, we have tracked a two to three
kilometer radius around his location.

42:03.000 --> 42:03.840
That's it.

42:05.000 --> 42:07.080
-Send details to all the police units.
-Yes, madam.

42:07.160 --> 42:09.240
Where's Manohar? Call him.

42:09.720 --> 42:10.600
Yes, madam.

42:20.440 --> 42:22.040
He left his mobile here and disappeared.

42:23.400 --> 42:25.680
It's okay.
Leave a message for him at home.

42:26.120 --> 42:28.160
The other units have already left
for the location,

42:28.240 --> 42:30.160
-I am going there but you stay here.
-Yes, madam.

42:44.640 --> 42:47.320
John. What is this paper?

42:48.960 --> 42:52.160
It's just a logo, that's all.

42:53.040 --> 42:54.600
Seems like a bird.

42:56.160 --> 42:57.560
I've seen it before.

43:01.240 --> 43:04.480
John! When you were
buying the property for Peter,

43:05.000 --> 43:08.560
those documents
had the same symbol. Remember?

43:23.360 --> 43:28.000
The property papers were right here.

43:28.880 --> 43:31.000
-Where are they?
-How should I know?

43:31.600 --> 43:33.080
Maybe Peter took it with him.

43:43.160 --> 43:44.000
Where are you going?

43:46.560 --> 43:48.600
-There's something I need to do.
-What?

43:49.520 --> 43:54.400
I've finally got my hands
on something concrete, Nancy.

43:55.480 --> 43:58.080
-Something which the police--
-Enough, John.

44:00.120 --> 44:01.000
That's enough.

44:02.600 --> 44:03.680
When will this end?

44:20.720 --> 44:24.160
I couldn't do anything for my daughter.

44:28.320 --> 44:33.920
And after she was gone,
I couldn't take care of our Angela also.

44:35.720 --> 44:39.280
I can't sleep at night, Nancy.

44:42.000 --> 44:47.920
I have to find the man
who took Angela away from us.

44:52.200 --> 44:58.640
And I promise you, I will find him.

46:06.480 --> 46:07.480
Tell me, John Uncle.

46:07.560 --> 46:09.440
Do you want to sell
or buy a property this time?

46:09.520 --> 46:10.440
No...

46:10.800 --> 46:12.840
When we were
buying the property for Peter,

46:13.400 --> 46:17.520
this logo was on one of the papers.

46:18.360 --> 46:19.680
Which company does it belong to?

46:19.800 --> 46:21.760
This one? It's the logo
of the government office.

46:21.840 --> 46:23.920
This symbol belongs to
the Land Measurement Office.

46:24.240 --> 46:25.160
What happened?

46:26.320 --> 46:28.040
Can you give me
the address of that office?

46:28.120 --> 46:30.280
Tell me what you need, uncle.
I can help you.

46:30.520 --> 46:31.760
I've many contacts there.

46:31.840 --> 46:34.560
But if you want to deal with some
other agent, then that's different.

46:34.640 --> 46:36.880
No, no, just give me the address.

46:37.400 --> 46:41.240
A friend of mine needs it.
He's got some personal work there.

46:41.600 --> 46:42.440
Sure?

46:42.840 --> 46:43.720
Fine!

46:44.280 --> 46:46.200
Sarita, there's one thing
that is bothering me.

46:46.960 --> 46:49.280
The ransom call that was made--

46:49.360 --> 46:50.920
We found no fingerprints on the phone.

46:51.480 --> 46:52.760
He cleaned everything.

46:53.120 --> 46:55.480
No, no. I am saying something else here.

46:55.920 --> 46:59.120
The ransom call that we received
we could hear traffic at the back.

46:59.680 --> 47:04.640
But there was no traffic around
the PCO from where the call was made.

47:08.040 --> 47:11.360
But the service provider confirmed
that that's where the call came from.

47:13.040 --> 47:16.160
Let's wait for the lab reports
on the cigarette butt.

47:43.360 --> 47:45.680
<i>...which means Pakistan</i>
<i>one strike away from winning this.</i>

47:45.760 --> 47:49.280
<i>Unbelievable scenes here...</i>
<i>In the air... Sreesanth takes it.</i>

47:49.360 --> 47:50.920
<i>India wins.</i>

47:51.600 --> 47:53.400
<i>Geoff Lawson can't believe it.</i>

48:44.440 --> 48:45.720
This was a corporate gift.

48:46.320 --> 48:49.760
Given by a big builder
in the year 2006-2007.

48:50.240 --> 48:51.200
To all the employees.

48:53.080 --> 48:56.040
How many people worked here back then?

48:56.800 --> 49:00.600
-Eight-nine years ago... around 2,000.
-Two thousand people?

49:00.680 --> 49:02.280
That's a rough figure. Could be more.

49:03.120 --> 49:06.720
Can I get a list of their names?

49:07.680 --> 49:10.480
Go to the Administrative Department,
and find out yourself.

49:10.560 --> 49:11.400
Go on.

49:11.480 --> 49:12.800
-This way?
-Yes.

49:13.520 --> 49:15.280
I've come from very far, son.

49:15.920 --> 49:18.920
I want to sell my land
before my daughter's marriage.

49:19.240 --> 49:20.160
That's not my problem.

49:20.920 --> 49:22.600
There are so many old cases still pending.

49:23.520 --> 49:25.200
You will have to wait
for at least a month.

49:25.840 --> 49:26.720
Please go.

49:27.160 --> 49:28.000
Next.

49:32.960 --> 49:33.880
What happened, uncle?

49:34.440 --> 49:36.600
He said it will take a month.

49:36.680 --> 49:38.440
One month? That's nonsense.

49:38.520 --> 49:40.320
Give me your phone number.

49:40.520 --> 49:42.040
The manager is my cousin.

49:42.120 --> 49:43.960
-I'll call him and get your job done.
-But...

49:44.040 --> 49:47.160
You see, this is not the way
to get things done.

49:47.480 --> 49:48.760
Who is John Biswas?

49:49.240 --> 49:50.200
Please come with me.

49:53.400 --> 49:56.840
Look, sir,
I am really surprised by your request.

49:58.400 --> 50:02.360
You want our eight/nine-year-old
employee records.

50:03.520 --> 50:05.960
That too for some
kidnapping investigation.

50:06.120 --> 50:08.320
No, no. Kidnapping and murder.

50:09.760 --> 50:12.360
The child who was kidnapped
didn't survive.

50:13.280 --> 50:17.480
But we didn't receive any
such requests from the police.

50:17.920 --> 50:22.400
The case isn't closed yet.
It's still being investigated.

50:22.480 --> 50:26.000
And the kidnapper is roaming free.
And you know--

50:26.080 --> 50:28.760
Sir, I'm referring to something different.

50:30.120 --> 50:32.160
Why didn't the police
send us an official request?

50:33.240 --> 50:36.560
Well, I can get a written order
from the police if you want,

50:36.640 --> 50:39.320
but you know how these things take time.

50:39.400 --> 50:41.720
If you can help me out, I'll be--

50:41.800 --> 50:45.160
Look sir, when you have waited
for eight/nine years,

50:45.240 --> 50:46.800
so a few more weeks shouldn't matter.

50:46.960 --> 50:49.720
I suggest you should get the police
to send us a request

50:50.600 --> 50:51.680
and we'll do the rest.

50:52.640 --> 50:58.400
Sir, maybe you can treat this case
as an exception and help me out.

50:58.800 --> 51:00.880
This list is very important for me.

51:00.960 --> 51:03.240
A new lead will really help me a lot.

51:03.320 --> 51:06.040
Please, sir. Please. I am busy.

51:39.640 --> 51:41.880
-Hello sir, am I late?
-No, no.

51:43.360 --> 51:45.520
-Would you like something to eat?
-No, sir. I am fine.

51:46.880 --> 51:47.760
Here you go.

51:49.680 --> 51:52.280
These are the entire records.
I think this will be useful to you.

51:55.040 --> 51:58.360
Sir, is there fuel in the tank?

51:59.280 --> 52:01.640
-Is there fuel in the tank?
-Yes.

52:02.160 --> 52:04.360
There should be around one or two liters.

52:04.440 --> 52:06.080
Okay fine. Thank you, sir.

52:09.080 --> 52:11.040
I came directly from work.

52:18.120 --> 52:18.960
Give it to me.

52:21.960 --> 52:24.160
Sir, I always dreamt of buying a scooter.

52:26.080 --> 52:27.480
Sir, can I take the helmet?

52:30.600 --> 52:31.560
Okay, sir. Thank you.

52:59.040 --> 52:59.880
You keep it.

53:52.440 --> 53:53.800
I didn't hear your scooter.

53:56.320 --> 53:57.200
It's in the garage.

54:02.320 --> 54:05.200
Leave it on. I haven't finished yet.

54:05.320 --> 54:06.880
I'll sleep once I'm done reading this.

54:10.520 --> 54:11.720
Don't stay up too late.

54:58.520 --> 54:59.640
Merry Christmas, John.

55:02.320 --> 55:06.240
She turned 16, an hour ago.

55:07.720 --> 55:08.920
She was born on this day...

55:10.360 --> 55:11.200
On Christmas.

55:12.840 --> 55:15.440
That's why we named her Angela.

55:16.160 --> 55:17.960
Angel... Angela.

55:18.040 --> 55:20.200
I will pray for her and for you, too.

55:20.280 --> 55:21.400
Let God grant you peace.

55:21.640 --> 55:24.160
I neither want peace nor your prayers.

55:27.880 --> 55:29.400
-What's this?
-Some names.

55:31.360 --> 55:32.960
If you've ever heard about anyone,

55:33.040 --> 55:35.880
maybe with some criminal record.

55:37.560 --> 55:41.320
The Land Measurement Office knew that
I was buying a property for Peter,

55:42.560 --> 55:43.600
and I have money.

55:45.240 --> 55:48.600
The police never paid attention
to this detail.

55:49.320 --> 55:51.240
Soon after this incident,

55:52.160 --> 55:53.560
few people quit their job.

55:54.040 --> 55:56.040
This is a list of those people.

55:58.680 --> 56:02.840
If you've ever heard about them,
or have any records...

56:04.320 --> 56:07.040
Is this the time to talk about all this?

56:08.040 --> 56:11.360
-Take a look, maybe--
-Father.

56:13.240 --> 56:15.040
My daughter made this card for you.

56:20.520 --> 56:21.480
My God.

56:22.920 --> 56:24.040
You made this?

56:24.760 --> 56:25.960
It's really beautiful.

56:26.520 --> 56:28.520
I'll always keep it with me.

56:37.400 --> 56:38.280
Bhaskar.

56:42.480 --> 56:43.360
Hello.

56:44.000 --> 56:45.560
<i>You wanted proof of life, didn't you?</i>

56:46.240 --> 56:49.320
<i>A garbage truck will pass by your house </i>
<i>in less than three minutes.</i>

56:57.720 --> 56:59.320
Hey, stop! Stop!

57:58.200 --> 57:59.160
It's the same kidnapper.

58:01.760 --> 58:02.640
He's back.

58:06.120 --> 58:07.120
You were right.

58:10.640 --> 58:12.080
So this is exactly how

58:12.360 --> 58:14.600
he had sent you evidence
that the child is alive.

58:15.240 --> 58:16.120
Then?

58:30.840 --> 58:32.800
He has asked you to
keep the bag near the pillar.

58:35.000 --> 58:37.640
So leave the bag there and don't wait.

58:38.800 --> 58:41.040
The police will have covered
the entire railway station.

58:41.120 --> 58:42.080
So don't worry about it.

58:44.760 --> 58:45.600
I am scared.

58:47.440 --> 58:52.040
He kept saying not to involve the police.

58:53.040 --> 58:54.360
I hope there won't be a problem.

58:54.600 --> 58:56.040
No, no, there won't be any problem.

58:56.480 --> 58:58.040
We'll arrest him and save Angela.

58:59.480 --> 59:00.960
So don't worry. Bhaskar, listen...

59:10.680 --> 59:12.520
You should talk to Peter once, John.

59:13.560 --> 59:14.960
Angela is his daughter.

59:15.480 --> 59:16.880
He has all the right to know.

59:19.560 --> 59:22.000
I'll tell him
once Angela is back home safely,

59:23.440 --> 59:25.080
or else he'll get scared and will panic.

59:27.880 --> 59:28.720
John.

59:31.200 --> 59:32.160
I must go now.

59:35.840 --> 59:37.080
All units are ready, sir.

1:00:39.600 --> 1:00:41.280
Hey, shut the station.

1:00:41.360 --> 1:00:42.680
Nobody should get out.

1:00:47.080 --> 1:00:48.200
It was all in vain.

1:00:49.040 --> 1:00:49.960
We couldn't catch him.

1:00:53.280 --> 1:00:54.480
If it's the same guy,

1:00:54.800 --> 1:00:56.680
do you think
he'll plan something similar?

1:00:57.200 --> 1:00:58.880
I can bet on it.

1:01:01.240 --> 1:01:03.120
You may have stopped
wearing the uniform,

1:01:03.200 --> 1:01:04.680
but you still sound like a policeman.

1:01:08.360 --> 1:01:10.800
Whom are you trying to deceive?
Your God or your own self?

1:01:11.120 --> 1:01:12.080
Father Martin?

1:01:19.520 --> 1:01:20.400
Hello.

1:01:20.560 --> 1:01:22.520
<i>-Did you get proof of life?</i>
-Yes.

1:01:22.600 --> 1:01:24.600
But I want to talk to Ronnie.

1:01:25.120 --> 1:01:26.200
<i>The time will come.</i>

1:01:26.800 --> 1:01:28.880
<i>But right now,</i>
<i>collect your parcel from the entrance.</i>

1:01:28.960 --> 1:01:29.880
Parcel?

1:02:07.200 --> 1:02:08.840
What happened after the station incident?

1:02:14.040 --> 1:02:15.640
-I want the file immediately.
-Yes, sir.

1:02:15.960 --> 1:02:16.800
Martin!

1:02:21.240 --> 1:02:22.240
Have you lost your mind?

1:02:23.280 --> 1:02:25.080
You lost two million of police money.

1:02:26.360 --> 1:02:29.560
Sorry, sir, but we have the serial numbers
of the notes.

1:02:29.840 --> 1:02:32.880
This means that until they spend
all the money and come back here,

1:02:32.960 --> 1:02:34.200
we will not do anything.

1:02:34.280 --> 1:02:35.560
Till then we'll be sitting idle.

1:02:36.320 --> 1:02:37.920
Hand over hand, like an idol.

1:02:39.880 --> 1:02:42.680
And now you want the kidnapper
to do your job for you,

1:02:43.240 --> 1:02:45.040
who has shown you all your place.

1:02:46.280 --> 1:02:47.120
Shameful.

1:02:47.200 --> 1:02:49.640
Extremely sorry, sir,
but as soon as possible--

1:02:49.720 --> 1:02:50.920
I am taking over this case.

1:02:51.320 --> 1:02:53.280
Put the entire unit to
trace the money back.

1:02:53.680 --> 1:02:56.160
Raise an alert in the city
and sniff the money out like dogs.

1:02:58.440 --> 1:03:00.800
He has anyway made you look like a dog.

1:03:00.880 --> 1:03:04.160
Extremely sorry, sir, but we should
have a unit at John's home.

1:03:04.320 --> 1:03:05.400
What if the kidnapper--

1:03:05.480 --> 1:03:07.640
Have you lost your mind, Martin?

1:03:08.640 --> 1:03:10.480
The kidnapper has the money now.

1:03:11.000 --> 1:03:12.880
Will he call back to say thank you?

1:03:14.400 --> 1:03:15.280
Idiot.

1:03:17.480 --> 1:03:21.800
Martin, just do as you're told. Got it?

1:03:40.320 --> 1:03:42.440
What are you guys doing here?
Who is at John's home?

1:03:42.520 --> 1:03:43.720
Chief asked us to come back.

1:03:43.800 --> 1:03:45.280
You should have waited for my order.

1:03:45.840 --> 1:03:46.720
Who's there now?

1:03:46.800 --> 1:03:48.680
There's no one,
we just left the recorder there.

1:03:48.760 --> 1:03:49.640
Left the recorder...

1:03:50.240 --> 1:03:51.120
What happened, sir?

1:03:51.320 --> 1:03:53.760
There's a difference between a recorder
and an order, idiot.

1:03:53.840 --> 1:03:54.920
What can the recorder do?

1:03:55.920 --> 1:03:56.760
What happened?

1:04:10.920 --> 1:04:11.800
Hello.

1:04:11.880 --> 1:04:13.280
You shouldn't have betrayed me.

1:04:13.360 --> 1:04:16.000
-You shouldn't have called the police.
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1:04:16.080 --> 1:04:18.120
Now I'll do exactly as you say.

1:04:18.280 --> 1:04:22.520
Please, don't hurt Angela. Please, please.

1:04:22.840 --> 1:04:25.240
<i>Fine, I'll give you another chance.</i>

1:04:28.200 --> 1:04:30.800
<i>-Grandpa... Grandpa...</i>
-Angela... Angela...

1:04:30.880 --> 1:04:31.800
<i>I'm sorry, grandpa.</i>

1:04:32.560 --> 1:04:33.760
It was my fault.

1:04:34.080 --> 1:04:36.240
I should have listened to you.

1:04:36.600 --> 1:04:40.200
I shouldn't have taken the shortcut.

1:04:40.600 --> 1:04:43.960
No, no, no, Angela.
You didn't make any mistake.

1:04:44.640 --> 1:04:46.520
You will be fine... You'll be fine.

1:04:46.600 --> 1:04:48.560
Grandpa. Grandpa.

1:04:50.280 --> 1:04:51.200
<i>Are you assured now?</i>

1:04:51.320 --> 1:04:53.720
I will tell you where to bring the money.

1:05:07.480 --> 1:05:09.880
John, this is Peter's money.

1:05:10.440 --> 1:05:11.680
We cannot take it.

1:05:11.960 --> 1:05:13.840
This was meant for buying
that property for him.

1:05:13.920 --> 1:05:19.280
Peter would've done the same thing
if he was in my place.

1:05:22.360 --> 1:05:26.640
There's a 12-hour time difference
between here and there.

1:05:28.320 --> 1:05:29.320
He must be sleeping now.

1:05:30.400 --> 1:05:33.320
It will take time to explain
everything to him, Nancy.

1:05:33.400 --> 1:05:37.240
And I don't have time.

1:05:38.760 --> 1:05:42.320
We should've told him when
this happened in the first place.

1:05:42.400 --> 1:05:44.520
It's not right to keep him in the dark.

1:05:44.840 --> 1:05:45.840
It's not right, John.

1:05:46.600 --> 1:05:48.160
At least talk to Martin once.

1:05:49.320 --> 1:05:53.200
Do you see any policeman here?

1:05:55.120 --> 1:05:57.120
This is their fault.

1:05:57.400 --> 1:05:58.960
And, now, they have left us alone.

1:05:59.800 --> 1:06:01.680
We must do this on our own, Nancy.

1:06:02.200 --> 1:06:03.080
On our own.

1:06:10.120 --> 1:06:11.000
John.

1:06:11.520 --> 1:06:13.880
-Where's John?
-Martin, the kidnapper called again.

1:06:14.720 --> 1:06:16.320
-Shit.
-John went alone.

1:06:21.000 --> 1:06:23.320
<i>-Grandpa!</i>
<i>-Are you convinced now?</i>

1:06:23.400 --> 1:06:25.880
<i>I will tell you where</i>
<i>to bring the money.</i>

1:06:26.480 --> 1:06:28.040
<i>As you drive out of the city,</i>

1:06:28.560 --> 1:06:31.760
<i>you'll come across a dirt track </i>
<i>on your right.</i>

1:06:33.520 --> 1:06:35.760
<i>Drive down that path, through the jungle.</i>

1:06:36.600 --> 1:06:38.000
<i>Then you will find a signboard</i>

1:06:39.720 --> 1:06:42.880
<i>that reads, "Kalikapur five kilometers."</i>

1:06:44.120 --> 1:06:45.320
<i>Just wait there.</i>

1:06:48.400 --> 1:06:50.880
Hello. Yes, Martin speaking.
I've some new information.

1:06:51.080 --> 1:06:52.880
Send all teams to Kalikapur.

1:06:52.960 --> 1:06:55.920
<i>Sir, we have tracked the marked notes</i>
<i>to a mobile shop at New Market.</i>

1:06:56.040 --> 1:06:57.280
<i>All units are going there.</i>

1:06:57.360 --> 1:06:59.320
It's a diversion.
The kidnapper is misleading you.

1:06:59.960 --> 1:07:01.880
The exchange is happening
near Kalikapur, got it?

1:07:02.240 --> 1:07:05.720
<i>Sir, you please speak to our chief.</i>
<i>He is leading the units.</i>

1:07:07.480 --> 1:07:09.600
<i>Wear the garbage bag over your head.</i>

1:08:09.240 --> 1:08:10.160
After that?

1:08:17.920 --> 1:08:18.880
I think we have reached.

1:08:23.720 --> 1:08:25.440
We will board the train
two stations prior.

1:08:25.520 --> 1:08:27.600
This time we will have
to catch him inside the train.

1:08:29.240 --> 1:08:31.560
Last time, we didn't focus on the train.

1:08:32.360 --> 1:08:33.560
This time we know.

1:08:34.480 --> 1:08:35.600
So that has to be covered.

1:08:36.440 --> 1:08:37.680
But, I am coming with you.

1:08:40.680 --> 1:08:42.200
Then who will go with the ransom bag?

1:08:42.680 --> 1:08:44.560
The real mother has to go
and deliver the bag.

1:08:44.840 --> 1:08:47.480
He may not recognize her voice,
but maybe he knows her face.

1:08:48.640 --> 1:08:49.680
We can't take that risk.

1:09:22.600 --> 1:09:24.280
He is in that compartment. Let's go there.

1:09:36.760 --> 1:09:38.480
<i>Mrs. Neeta, don't be scared.</i>

1:09:38.680 --> 1:09:40.320
<i>We have placed a tracker inside the bag.</i>

1:09:40.520 --> 1:09:42.120
Leave the bag near the pillar.

1:09:43.680 --> 1:09:44.760
<i>Tracker is on mark, sir.</i>

1:09:45.360 --> 1:09:47.200
<i>The train is reaching</i>
<i>platform number one, sir.</i>

1:09:50.040 --> 1:09:50.880
All teams alert.

1:09:51.280 --> 1:09:53.040
The train is approaching
platform number one.

1:09:53.840 --> 1:09:56.000
Platform team,
be alert and take your positions.

1:09:57.760 --> 1:09:59.200
Phone booth unit is ready.

1:09:59.920 --> 1:10:01.400
Yes, sir. The train has arrived.

1:10:20.200 --> 1:10:21.600
<i>Platform is full of army cadets.</i>

1:10:21.680 --> 1:10:23.120
There are army cadets everywhere.

1:10:24.200 --> 1:10:25.520
The bag isn't visible!

1:10:29.600 --> 1:10:31.000
The bag's moving! The bag's moving!

1:10:31.160 --> 1:10:32.840
It's heading toward platform number two.

1:10:32.920 --> 1:10:34.640
-Keep watching. Keep watching.
-Okay, sir.

1:10:38.160 --> 1:10:39.640
They can't find the bag.

1:10:39.720 --> 1:10:40.680
I should go to my team.

1:10:40.760 --> 1:10:42.360
I'll look on the other side,
I missed that last time.

1:10:42.440 --> 1:10:43.280
Yes.

1:10:51.520 --> 1:10:52.400
Move.

1:10:59.520 --> 1:11:01.440
<i>The bag's heading</i>
<i>toward platform number three.</i>

1:11:10.760 --> 1:11:12.000
The tracker is static.

1:11:17.880 --> 1:11:18.920
<i>Madam, signal is lost.</i>

1:11:19.240 --> 1:11:20.640
-What?
<i>-Signal is lost, madam.</i>

1:11:21.000 --> 1:11:21.880
Martin.

1:11:24.360 --> 1:11:25.200
He's here.

1:11:55.320 --> 1:11:56.240
Let me go.

1:12:20.640 --> 1:12:21.880
<i>I have already told you...</i>

1:12:22.480 --> 1:12:27.160
He called me and told me to do this.

1:12:27.760 --> 1:12:29.200
Why don't you believe me?

1:12:31.520 --> 1:12:34.480
Actually, I haven't slept properly
since the last few days.

1:12:37.480 --> 1:12:39.560
So it's hard to put everything
together in my head.

1:12:40.920 --> 1:12:42.560
Will you repeat that again, please?

1:12:44.280 --> 1:12:49.240
You're making me repeat it
so that I make a mistake and you nail me.

1:12:50.720 --> 1:12:53.320
But that won't happen, madam,
because I am telling the truth.

1:12:54.000 --> 1:12:56.440
It won't change no matter
how many times I say it.

1:13:00.000 --> 1:13:02.040
You seem quite familiar
with interrogation methods.

1:13:02.880 --> 1:13:03.720
How?

1:13:05.160 --> 1:13:07.160
By the way, you don't need to worry.

1:13:07.400 --> 1:13:08.640
This time I will write it down.

1:13:09.080 --> 1:13:11.480
Bablu, get me a pen and a paper.

1:13:16.200 --> 1:13:17.480
<i>So you received a call from him?</i>

1:13:17.920 --> 1:13:18.800
<i>Yes.</i>

1:13:20.840 --> 1:13:21.760
Then?

1:13:21.840 --> 1:13:23.760
Yeah, okay. Okay.

1:13:30.640 --> 1:13:31.480
Yes, I am here.

1:13:32.480 --> 1:13:33.520
I can see the road.

1:13:39.640 --> 1:13:42.120
<i>Grandpa, help. Grandpa, where are you?</i>

1:13:42.200 --> 1:13:43.080
Ronnie?

1:13:43.160 --> 1:13:46.560
<i>Grandpa, where are you? Grandpa, help.</i>

1:13:53.760 --> 1:13:54.800
<i>Grandpa. Grandpa, help.</i>

1:13:54.880 --> 1:13:56.320
Ronnie! Ronnie.

1:14:14.480 --> 1:14:16.200
<i>Grandpa, help. Grandpa.</i>

1:14:16.560 --> 1:14:19.560
<i>Grandpa, where are you? Grandpa, help.</i>

1:14:19.640 --> 1:14:21.240
-Ronnie.
<i>-When will you come, grandpa?</i>

1:14:21.320 --> 1:14:25.040
<i>Grandpa, come fast. Grandpa, help.</i>

1:14:25.200 --> 1:14:28.440
<i>Please, grandpa. Please. Grandpa, help.</i>

1:14:28.520 --> 1:14:30.840
<i>When will you come, grandpa? Save me.</i>

1:14:30.920 --> 1:14:34.600
<i>Grandpa, help. Please.</i>

1:14:43.880 --> 1:14:46.680
Hey, stop. Where is Ronnie?

1:14:48.600 --> 1:14:49.600
Who are you?

1:14:50.840 --> 1:14:53.600
I kept yelling for help, but no one came.

1:14:54.000 --> 1:14:56.160
I don't know how long
I was locked up in there.

1:14:57.080 --> 1:14:58.600
There was no way to escape.

1:15:00.720 --> 1:15:03.960
<i>I kept looking around</i>
<i>in the dark for a while.</i>

1:15:05.800 --> 1:15:06.680
<i>And then I sat down.</i>

1:15:44.880 --> 1:15:46.320
<i>It was written on the paper,</i>

1:15:46.400 --> 1:15:50.040
<i>wear the uniform and go to the place, </i>
<i>programmed in the GPS in 30 minutes.</i>

1:15:50.120 --> 1:15:52.280
<i>Even a delay of one minute,</i>
<i>will cost the child's life.</i>

1:16:00.080 --> 1:16:01.520
Am I allowed to smoke in here?

1:16:02.560 --> 1:16:03.480
No.

1:16:03.920 --> 1:16:05.520
But there's no one to complain either.

1:16:28.680 --> 1:16:29.600
Thank you.

1:16:33.680 --> 1:16:34.840
Please believe me.

1:16:35.840 --> 1:16:37.080
He still has Ronnie with him.

1:16:38.120 --> 1:16:40.880
You're wasting your time.
You can still save Ronnie.

1:16:41.920 --> 1:16:42.960
Where's your car?

1:16:44.480 --> 1:16:47.080
Don't know...
I left it outside the railway station.

1:16:48.040 --> 1:16:48.920
And your mobile?

1:16:49.800 --> 1:16:53.720
When I was crossing the Hooghly bridge,
he called again.

1:16:55.560 --> 1:16:57.480
<i>He told me to throw away my phone.</i>

1:16:58.920 --> 1:17:01.280
<i>I asked him where will I find Ronnie?</i>

1:17:02.000 --> 1:17:04.400
And he said there's a bag
in the boot of the car,

1:17:05.480 --> 1:17:08.840
which I must exchange
at the railway platform.

1:17:09.400 --> 1:17:11.240
Later, I must run to the end
of the station

1:17:11.320 --> 1:17:13.200
and throw it across the wall
on the other side.

1:17:14.040 --> 1:17:16.280
I was about to throw the bag,
when you caught me.

1:17:17.400 --> 1:17:21.320
He also said that if I succeed
in throwing the bag,

1:17:22.200 --> 1:17:24.200
I will find Ronnie
on the other side of the wall.

1:17:27.600 --> 1:17:28.600
And you believed him.

1:17:30.480 --> 1:17:31.840
Did I have a choice?

1:17:36.320 --> 1:17:37.320
You can cry later.

1:17:40.080 --> 1:17:41.280
First finish your cigarette.

1:17:41.880 --> 1:17:43.160
My officers will be here soon.

1:17:43.720 --> 1:17:45.200
They are not as generous as me.

1:17:53.840 --> 1:17:54.920
Seems like the same brand.

1:17:58.600 --> 1:18:00.360
You should be happy, Father Martin.

1:18:00.920 --> 1:18:02.200
We finally found your kidnapper.

1:18:03.240 --> 1:18:04.080
I am happy.

1:18:04.160 --> 1:18:06.160
I am quite happy the way you handled it.

1:18:07.160 --> 1:18:09.720
But I feel something's wrong.

1:18:20.880 --> 1:18:24.160
<i>The shining sun of joy</i>

1:18:24.240 --> 1:18:27.800
<i>The radiant dome of bliss</i>

1:18:27.880 --> 1:18:32.920
<i>It submerged the envious glances </i>
<i>Total eclipse</i>

1:18:34.680 --> 1:18:38.000
<i>Effective was his ploy</i>

1:18:38.080 --> 1:18:41.480
<i>In ill-fated times</i>

1:18:41.560 --> 1:18:45.720
<i>It spread like venom</i>
<i>Total eclipse</i>

1:18:52.000 --> 1:18:55.480
<i>The shining sun of joy</i>

1:18:55.560 --> 1:18:58.920
<i>The radiant dome of bliss</i>

1:18:59.000 --> 1:19:03.360
<i>It submerged the envious glances</i>
<i>Total eclipse</i>

1:19:05.880 --> 1:19:09.280
<i>A woe unexpected</i>

1:19:09.360 --> 1:19:12.760
<i>Like termite</i>

1:19:12.840 --> 1:19:17.640
<i>It gnawed away bit by bit</i>
<i>Total eclipse</i>

1:19:21.000 --> 1:19:24.480
<i>The vision is foggy</i>

1:19:24.560 --> 1:19:27.560
<i>All the doors are shut</i>

1:19:27.640 --> 1:19:32.440
<i>Every assurance sounds false</i>

1:19:35.000 --> 1:19:38.280
<i>The voice quivers</i>

1:19:38.360 --> 1:19:41.320
<i>A secret behind the curtain</i>

1:19:41.400 --> 1:19:46.800
<i>Why isn't it being revealed? </i>

1:19:48.200 --> 1:19:50.000
Excuse me. Mister.

1:19:51.520 --> 1:19:55.120
-Manager? Manager?
-Yes, that's me. Tell me.

1:19:55.560 --> 1:19:57.640
I am a journalist.

1:19:59.240 --> 1:20:02.000
I am writing an article

1:20:02.440 --> 1:20:04.840
on the dying mill industry

1:20:04.920 --> 1:20:07.680
and the abandoned ones
that are still functioning.

1:20:08.280 --> 1:20:12.640
The mill owner, Mr. Hari Prakash.

1:20:12.720 --> 1:20:14.120
I want to talk to him. Where is he?

1:20:14.720 --> 1:20:16.280
He hasn't arrived yet.

1:20:16.840 --> 1:20:19.400
-He hasn't arrived yet.
-I see.

1:20:20.360 --> 1:20:22.960
-Where's his office?
-First floor.

1:20:23.040 --> 1:20:24.880
First floor.

1:20:24.960 --> 1:20:26.680
Okay, where is the first floor?

1:20:52.560 --> 1:20:54.760
Father Martin, we have a warrant.

1:20:55.680 --> 1:20:57.280
We're going to search Manohar's house.

1:20:59.080 --> 1:21:00.080
Will you come along?

1:21:00.520 --> 1:21:01.400
No...

1:21:09.840 --> 1:21:12.240
Did you ever feel that
your father could do--

1:21:12.320 --> 1:21:14.080
He loved Ronnie a lot.

1:21:14.680 --> 1:21:16.240
I just can't believe this.

1:21:17.160 --> 1:21:18.320
Why will he do such a thing?

1:21:18.800 --> 1:21:22.400
Honestly, I've seen stranger cases
than this in my career.

1:21:23.000 --> 1:21:25.360
But are you sure he's the one?

1:21:26.360 --> 1:21:27.760
Because I just don't get it.

1:21:28.840 --> 1:21:32.680
Although, since I got here,
everyone pointed out

1:21:32.760 --> 1:21:35.360
that he's been missing
from the moment you came here.

1:21:38.640 --> 1:21:39.480
Just a minute.

1:21:44.880 --> 1:21:46.120
What is your opinion about him?

1:21:47.200 --> 1:21:49.600
Honestly, I don't know him too well.

1:21:50.360 --> 1:21:53.200
All I know is that he worked
somewhere in the Gulf.

1:21:53.560 --> 1:21:55.560
He didn't attend our wedding either.

1:21:56.120 --> 1:21:59.120
But, yes, he did come
when Neeta was pregnant.

1:21:59.720 --> 1:22:02.000
By then I was already posted
in the north-east,

1:22:02.080 --> 1:22:03.800
and I would only
come home during holidays.

1:22:04.080 --> 1:22:05.760
There was not much interaction.

1:22:06.240 --> 1:22:10.040
When Neeta told me that
he'll stay with us,

1:22:10.440 --> 1:22:11.600
I thought it's okay.

1:22:11.680 --> 1:22:12.760
Because I hardly stay here.

1:22:12.840 --> 1:22:15.520
If someone stays with Neeta in my absence,
it will be good for her.

1:22:18.000 --> 1:22:22.040
There's one thing, though,
we didn't get along on certain issues.

1:22:23.560 --> 1:22:24.520
Is this your house?

1:22:24.920 --> 1:22:26.520
No, this is a family house.

1:22:27.000 --> 1:22:29.800
So where did Neeta and Manohar live
before your wedding?

1:22:31.000 --> 1:22:32.480
<i>They had a small house in Barrackpur.</i>

1:22:49.960 --> 1:22:50.920
Did you check here?

1:22:56.400 --> 1:22:58.160
-Sarita.
-Yeah.

1:23:00.920 --> 1:23:01.760
Look.

1:23:02.640 --> 1:23:05.440
Same wall. Same marks.

1:23:08.400 --> 1:23:10.000
So this is where the picture was taken?

1:23:17.000 --> 1:23:19.760
You mean to say that someone
from the Land Measurement Division

1:23:19.840 --> 1:23:21.080
was involved in the kidnapping?

1:23:22.000 --> 1:23:25.480
Because the people in your office knew

1:23:26.480 --> 1:23:30.720
that I am buying a land,
and the amount of money I had.

1:23:33.000 --> 1:23:39.880
The police focused on every aspect,
but left this one out.

1:23:44.320 --> 1:23:45.800
Didn't you ever suspect him?

1:23:47.120 --> 1:23:48.000
Kumar?

1:23:49.720 --> 1:23:52.080
He was thrown out for fraudulence
and mishandling of money.

1:23:56.360 --> 1:23:57.320
Kumar?

1:23:58.280 --> 1:24:01.360
Sir, Manohar also worked
in a government office.

1:24:01.720 --> 1:24:03.080
Back then he had a steady income.

1:24:03.160 --> 1:24:04.800
Then suddenly one day he quit.

1:24:05.720 --> 1:24:07.680
So, he never got pension
or retirement benefits.

1:24:08.320 --> 1:24:10.560
Before his wife's death,

1:24:10.640 --> 1:24:13.200
she transferred her village property
in the name of her daughter.

1:24:13.280 --> 1:24:14.120
Oh, I see.

1:24:14.200 --> 1:24:18.560
The same property, which his son-in-law,
Neeta's husband, wanted to sell.

1:24:19.600 --> 1:24:21.720
Because he couldn't maintain the place.

1:24:22.360 --> 1:24:25.240
If he had sold the house, then Manohar
would've been left with nothing.

1:24:25.360 --> 1:24:27.400
He would've been dependent
on his son-in-law.

1:24:27.480 --> 1:24:28.880
And they don't get along, sir.

1:24:30.520 --> 1:24:33.600
So according to me, this kidnapping
was Manohar's retirement plan.

1:24:35.240 --> 1:24:36.400
Then, what about the media?

1:24:37.240 --> 1:24:39.880
Sir, we have matched his DNA

1:24:39.960 --> 1:24:42.320
with the cigarette butt
found outside the PCO.

1:24:43.800 --> 1:24:45.400
We already have a prime suspect.

1:24:45.480 --> 1:24:48.160
But I suggest that
we shouldn't go to the media

1:24:48.240 --> 1:24:49.560
till we find Ronnie.

1:24:50.000 --> 1:24:51.760
We're looking for Manohar's car.

1:24:52.120 --> 1:24:53.560
Find it as soon as you can, Sarita.

1:24:53.640 --> 1:24:56.720
Because I don't think I can hold back
the media for long.

1:24:56.800 --> 1:24:58.000
-Understand?
-Yes, sir.

1:25:00.840 --> 1:25:02.240
So what's the commissioner saying?

1:25:02.520 --> 1:25:04.480
He's asked me to find Ronnie
as soon as possible.

1:25:04.920 --> 1:25:07.840
But he's also in a hurry to
inform the press about Manohar's arrest.

1:25:07.920 --> 1:25:08.880
Oh...

1:25:14.080 --> 1:25:14.920
What?

1:25:16.360 --> 1:25:17.280
What's bothering you?

1:25:17.720 --> 1:25:20.520
You've seen all the evidence.
Why don't you accept it?

1:25:27.160 --> 1:25:28.360
You answered his ransom call.

1:25:30.440 --> 1:25:32.000
Wouldn't he have recognized your voice?

1:25:32.600 --> 1:25:34.840
But he kept talking to you as Neeta.

1:25:35.200 --> 1:25:36.080
Why?

1:25:36.160 --> 1:25:38.520
Maybe I sound like Neeta over the phone?

1:25:39.360 --> 1:25:40.840
Or maybe the line wasn't clear?

1:25:41.600 --> 1:25:43.400
Bad connection? Every time?

1:25:44.520 --> 1:25:45.760
That's your argument.

1:26:03.640 --> 1:26:04.480
Where is Ronnie?

1:26:06.560 --> 1:26:10.240
I told you I don't know.
I didn't kidnap him.

1:26:13.880 --> 1:26:16.920
You know your daughter
has a heart problem. You know, right?

1:26:17.960 --> 1:26:19.440
Do you want to give her more stress?

1:26:21.080 --> 1:26:22.640
She must be suffering every moment.

1:26:24.280 --> 1:26:28.080
The longer her son stays away from her,
the more she will suffer.

1:26:29.960 --> 1:26:31.200
What kind of a father are you?

1:26:31.280 --> 1:26:32.920
Your own daughter is suffering and you...

1:26:33.840 --> 1:26:35.040
Where is Ronnie?

1:26:37.640 --> 1:26:41.240
I told you, I didn't kidnap him.

1:26:41.600 --> 1:26:42.800
Why will I...

1:27:52.760 --> 1:27:53.640
Kumar.

1:28:36.720 --> 1:28:39.640
Munna is a drug lord of this area.

1:28:43.080 --> 1:28:45.240
I owe him 50,000 rupees.

1:28:47.360 --> 1:28:49.000
They are after me.

1:28:50.640 --> 1:28:52.760
During the time period
you're inquiring about

1:28:54.560 --> 1:28:58.960
I was in prison for drunk driving.

1:29:00.440 --> 1:29:03.200
You can confirm with the police.

1:29:04.320 --> 1:29:05.360
And that black van?

1:29:06.200 --> 1:29:07.040
Belongs to me.

1:29:08.520 --> 1:29:10.120
I used to hire it out.

1:29:11.280 --> 1:29:12.800
To clients who had to shift furniture.

1:29:13.520 --> 1:29:14.960
Like movers and packers, you know...

1:29:15.840 --> 1:29:16.840
Mostly to them.

1:29:37.840 --> 1:29:40.200
There are pictures of army personnel
in your home.

1:29:40.280 --> 1:29:41.320
Where did that come from?

1:29:42.240 --> 1:29:45.400
Someone or the other from my family
has always been in the army.

1:29:47.400 --> 1:29:48.760
There are many institutions

1:29:48.840 --> 1:29:52.400
who hires ex-army men
for security services.

1:29:55.440 --> 1:29:58.480
Was there anyone else
in the Land Measurement Office

1:29:58.560 --> 1:30:00.440
who was an ex-army man?

1:30:07.600 --> 1:30:08.840
Anyone from this list?

1:30:13.600 --> 1:30:15.440
-Did you get it?
-Sarita.

1:30:15.800 --> 1:30:18.040
-No water, fan, nothing for him.
-I want to speak to you.

1:30:18.120 --> 1:30:19.600
-And... Just a minute.
-Sarita...

1:30:20.360 --> 1:30:21.480
-You stay there.
-Yes.

1:30:21.880 --> 1:30:22.840
I want to talk to you.

1:30:24.360 --> 1:30:25.520
-Sarita.
-Yes.

1:30:26.160 --> 1:30:27.360
We haven't found Ronnie yet...

1:30:27.920 --> 1:30:28.960
We're making a mistake.

1:30:30.760 --> 1:30:31.680
What mistake?

1:30:32.000 --> 1:30:33.080
It's an open and shut case.

1:30:33.680 --> 1:30:36.480
After looking at the wall in his house
there is no room for any doubt.

1:30:36.800 --> 1:30:38.320
He's just pretending, we'll break him.

1:30:38.400 --> 1:30:39.240
The yellow wall?

1:30:39.800 --> 1:30:41.040
What is so unique about it?

1:30:41.240 --> 1:30:43.400
You can paint any wall,
take a picture, that's it.

1:30:44.760 --> 1:30:46.960
See, even if we believe
that it is the same house,

1:30:47.120 --> 1:30:50.000
but Manohar is claiming that he was
locked up in some other place.

1:30:50.280 --> 1:30:53.360
The real kidnapper could have taken
the child there and clicked his picture.

1:30:54.440 --> 1:30:55.920
If Manohar was locked up,

1:30:57.040 --> 1:30:58.880
then, how can he make the ransom call?

1:30:59.920 --> 1:31:01.480
Only if Manohar is speaking the truth.

1:31:01.560 --> 1:31:02.840
What if he's telling the truth?

1:31:04.840 --> 1:31:07.400
See, the kidnapper called from a PCO.

1:31:07.480 --> 1:31:08.960
<i>Then he wiped his own fingerprints.</i>

1:31:09.040 --> 1:31:10.600
<i>But he left behind the cigarette butt.</i>

1:31:11.080 --> 1:31:12.880
So under the circumstances,
he did two things.

1:31:12.960 --> 1:31:14.800
He showed his clever side
and his foolish side.

1:31:14.880 --> 1:31:15.800
Isn't that strange?

1:31:16.360 --> 1:31:18.040
Now, we must think from a different angle.

1:31:18.360 --> 1:31:19.880
If he was wearing a pair of gloves,

1:31:21.240 --> 1:31:22.880
everything would have changed easily.

1:31:24.000 --> 1:31:25.560
Then he would've never wiped the phone.

1:31:29.560 --> 1:31:30.440
In that situation,

1:31:30.520 --> 1:31:32.520
you would've found many fingerprints
on the phone,

1:31:32.600 --> 1:31:35.280
<i>and you would've wasted precious time</i>
<i>in finding a single match.</i>

1:31:35.760 --> 1:31:37.560
<i>And yet you wouldn't</i>
<i>have found your suspect.</i>

1:31:38.880 --> 1:31:41.160
When we caught him, he was trying to

1:31:41.520 --> 1:31:43.760
throw the bag of money
on the other side of the wall.

1:31:43.840 --> 1:31:44.720
Why?

1:31:46.800 --> 1:31:48.680
After taking such
a big risk to get this money,

1:31:49.360 --> 1:31:52.560
he'd throw the bag on the other side only
if he had a partner on the other side.

1:31:52.640 --> 1:31:54.840
<i>Or if someone had threatened him to do it.</i>

1:31:57.640 --> 1:31:59.760
Your theory about the partner
might be right.

1:32:00.800 --> 1:32:05.920
But his story about locking him up
and threatening him is bullshit.

1:32:15.120 --> 1:32:16.120
What are you thinking?

1:32:18.840 --> 1:32:21.640
He repeated his eight-year-old plan again.

1:32:24.000 --> 1:32:26.320
And this time with lesser risk.

1:35:16.400 --> 1:35:18.600
-I need you to check a CD.
-Come on.

1:35:24.960 --> 1:35:27.520
<i>Grandpa, help. Where are you?</i>

1:35:27.600 --> 1:35:32.520
<i>Save me, grandpa.</i>
<i>Where are you? Please, help me.</i>

1:35:32.720 --> 1:35:35.680
<i>When will you come, grandpa?</i>
<i>Come fast, grandpa.</i>

1:35:36.840 --> 1:35:40.600
<i>Please, grandpa. Help me.</i>

1:35:43.440 --> 1:35:45.160
This means Manohar was telling the truth.

1:35:46.400 --> 1:35:48.480
-Who?
-No, nothing.

1:35:50.320 --> 1:35:51.680
Was that the only voice on the CD?

1:35:52.120 --> 1:35:55.280
-That's the main audio.
-Main audio?

1:35:56.120 --> 1:35:57.120
Is there something else?

1:35:57.360 --> 1:36:00.560
Look, there's a soft voice here.

1:36:02.080 --> 1:36:06.400
<i>Say, "Help, grandpa."</i>
<i>Say loudly, "Help me."</i>

1:36:06.480 --> 1:36:08.280
<i>Grandpa, help. Help me...</i>

1:36:08.360 --> 1:36:10.640
<i>Say it loudly, "Help, grandpa."</i>

1:36:10.720 --> 1:36:12.600
<i>-Help, grandpa.</i>
<i>-"Grandpa, help."</i>

1:36:12.680 --> 1:36:13.960
-Put this on.
<i>-Grandpa, help.</i>

1:36:19.640 --> 1:36:22.800
<i>Be loud and say, "Help, grandpa."</i>

1:36:24.080 --> 1:36:26.160
<i>Help, grandpa. Help me.</i>

1:36:28.360 --> 1:36:30.800
<i>Help, grandpa. Help me.</i>

1:36:45.040 --> 1:36:49.040
So this is that kidnapper who hasn't
let me sleep for all these years.

1:38:23.120 --> 1:38:25.560
I haven't done anything.

1:38:25.640 --> 1:38:27.200
-I am being framed.
-Go inside.

1:38:27.520 --> 1:38:28.480
Believe me.

1:38:30.240 --> 1:38:31.080
Move.

1:38:55.120 --> 1:38:57.360
You're making a big mistake.
He didn't commit this crime.

1:38:57.440 --> 1:38:59.840
He was locked in the warehouse.
I gave you that CD.

1:39:00.320 --> 1:39:01.200
What do you mean?

1:39:01.440 --> 1:39:02.920
Who said this to you? Manohar?

1:39:03.520 --> 1:39:05.080
He wants this to happen.

1:39:05.680 --> 1:39:08.240
And the other voice on the CD
could be Manohar's as well.

1:39:08.320 --> 1:39:09.480
You're making a mistake.

1:39:09.560 --> 1:39:11.160
-He did it.
-So where's Ronnie?

1:39:11.720 --> 1:39:12.960
You looked everywhere.

1:39:13.040 --> 1:39:15.120
He kidnapped the child,
and was apprehended as well,

1:39:15.200 --> 1:39:17.200
yet we have no clue,
how does this make any sense?

1:39:17.520 --> 1:39:20.560
I think he's killed the child
and hid the body.

1:39:22.120 --> 1:39:23.000
What?

1:39:25.400 --> 1:39:26.320
What do you mean?

1:39:26.800 --> 1:39:28.480
Yes. If the body isn't found,

1:39:28.560 --> 1:39:30.760
he knows he cannot be charged
with kidnapping.

1:39:30.960 --> 1:39:32.160
And if the body's found,

1:39:32.240 --> 1:39:34.400
then he'll be charged
with kidnapping and murder.

1:39:34.480 --> 1:39:35.880
That's why he isn't confessing.

1:39:36.320 --> 1:39:37.320
You're making a mistake.

1:39:39.120 --> 1:39:40.760
The kidnapper didn't kill Angela.

1:39:41.360 --> 1:39:42.200
Her death...

1:39:44.440 --> 1:39:46.080
Her death was an accident.

1:39:57.320 --> 1:39:59.000
This isn't Angela's case nor is it yours.

1:40:01.040 --> 1:40:02.960
Maybe Angela's kidnapper was someone else.

1:40:03.840 --> 1:40:04.760
Maybe I was wrong.

1:40:06.400 --> 1:40:09.360
He could've gathered these details
from the police files as well.

1:40:10.280 --> 1:40:12.640
Maybe he's trying to confuse us.

1:40:13.480 --> 1:40:15.000
Don't try to mix both the cases.

1:40:15.080 --> 1:40:16.560
You are not trying to understand.

1:40:18.320 --> 1:40:20.720
Both the cases are the same.
They are linked.

1:40:24.200 --> 1:40:26.120
Manohar isn't your kidnapper,
it's someone else.

1:40:28.760 --> 1:40:31.240
Take a look at the voice analysis report

1:40:32.040 --> 1:40:34.080
of the ransom call that
was made to Manohar's home.

1:40:34.640 --> 1:40:35.840
Ronnie's ransom call.

1:40:36.840 --> 1:40:37.960
It's Manohar's voice.

1:40:38.600 --> 1:40:39.920
It's a perfect match.

1:40:49.000 --> 1:40:51.680
A voiceprint is as foolproof
as evidence, as a fingerprint.

1:40:57.400 --> 1:41:01.200
And you know,
it's impossible to fake one's voice.

1:41:05.080 --> 1:41:09.400
It's absolutely clear,
Manohar is the kidnapper.

1:41:17.720 --> 1:41:19.040
<i>Why did you call the police?</i>

1:41:19.560 --> 1:41:21.080
<i>I have your grandchild.</i>

1:41:21.160 --> 1:41:22.800
<i>So stop wasting my time.</i>

1:41:22.880 --> 1:41:25.760
<i>If you want to see him alive,</i>
<i>arrange two million by tomorrow morning.</i>

1:41:25.840 --> 1:41:26.960
<i>I will call again.</i>

1:41:30.520 --> 1:41:31.880
<i>Why did you call the police?</i>

1:41:32.320 --> 1:41:34.080
<i>I have your grandchild.</i>

1:41:34.160 --> 1:41:35.680
<i>So stop wasting my time.</i>

1:41:35.760 --> 1:41:38.680
<i>If you want to see him alive </i>
<i>arrange two million by tomorrow morning.</i>

1:41:38.760 --> 1:41:39.760
<i>I will call again.</i>

1:41:41.040 --> 1:41:42.600
<i>Why did you call the police?</i>

1:41:42.880 --> 1:41:44.600
<i>I have your grandchild.</i>

1:41:44.680 --> 1:41:46.080
<i>So stop wasting my time.</i>

1:41:46.160 --> 1:41:49.160
<i>If you want to see him alive </i>
<i>arrange two million by tomorrow morning.</i>

1:41:49.240 --> 1:41:50.440
<i>I will call again.</i>

1:41:59.160 --> 1:42:00.800
<i>Why did you call the police?</i>

1:42:01.000 --> 1:42:02.760
<i>I have your grandchild.</i>

1:42:02.840 --> 1:42:04.520
<i>So stop wasting my time.</i>

1:42:04.600 --> 1:42:07.440
<i>If you want to see him alive,</i>
<i>arrange two million by tomorrow morning.</i>

1:42:07.520 --> 1:42:08.480
<i>I will call again.</i>

1:42:14.080 --> 1:42:17.800
Angelina... Eight years...

1:42:19.840 --> 1:42:20.800
Angelina...

1:42:21.200 --> 1:42:23.280
Angela... A-N-G-E-L-A.

1:42:27.160 --> 1:42:28.000
Found it.

1:42:33.840 --> 1:42:36.240
It will take time to digitize
the old tape and listen to it.

1:42:38.560 --> 1:42:40.120
But what do you want to prove, Martin?

1:42:41.400 --> 1:42:42.880
This CD has the current ransom call.

1:42:43.400 --> 1:42:46.120
Match the voice and see.
Does it match with my case?

1:42:46.400 --> 1:42:48.920
-This is the new ransom call.
<i>-Why did you call the police?</i>

1:42:49.040 --> 1:42:50.320
<i>I have your grandchild.</i>

1:42:50.400 --> 1:42:51.840
Why is the voice so muffled?

1:42:52.920 --> 1:42:54.080
Must be the recording.

1:42:54.760 --> 1:42:55.600
No, no.

1:42:59.840 --> 1:43:02.080
-Listen to this.
<i>-Why did you call the police?</i>

1:43:02.320 --> 1:43:03.800
<i>I have your grandchild.</i>

1:43:03.880 --> 1:43:05.440
<i>So stop wasting my time.</i>

1:43:05.520 --> 1:43:08.640
<i>If you want to see him alive,</i>
<i>arrange two million by tomorrow morning.</i>

1:43:08.720 --> 1:43:09.960
The cycle bell is so clear.

1:43:11.160 --> 1:43:13.280
How can the voice be so muffled,

1:43:14.880 --> 1:43:16.520
if the mouth piece is so close to him?

1:43:17.200 --> 1:43:18.720
Let me just enhance the audio clip.

1:43:18.800 --> 1:43:20.240
<i>Hello, I am his mother speaking?</i>

1:43:20.320 --> 1:43:21.800
Her voice sounds normal.

1:43:21.880 --> 1:43:25.720
But why don't both the voices
seem to balance?

1:43:26.000 --> 1:43:27.480
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

1:43:27.560 --> 1:43:28.440
Let's check.

1:43:29.360 --> 1:43:31.200
Even if the kidnapper used a filter,

1:43:32.080 --> 1:43:34.360
his voice quality can't be so bad.

1:43:35.800 --> 1:43:37.360
<i>Why did you call the police?</i>

1:43:37.800 --> 1:43:39.920
<i>I have your grandchild.</i>

1:43:49.040 --> 1:43:49.920
Martin.

1:43:51.840 --> 1:43:52.680
Martin!

1:43:53.960 --> 1:43:56.120
I have matched the old and the new calls.

1:43:56.520 --> 1:43:57.400
Find anything?

1:43:57.520 --> 1:43:58.400
It's the same call.

1:44:00.320 --> 1:44:01.200
What?

1:44:02.320 --> 1:44:03.240
Look...

1:44:03.320 --> 1:44:05.080
This is the current kidnapper's waveform.

1:44:06.840 --> 1:44:08.520
And this is the kidnapper from your case.

1:44:09.080 --> 1:44:10.280
<i>Why did you call the police?</i>

1:44:10.360 --> 1:44:11.880
I'll play them simultaneously.

1:44:13.160 --> 1:44:15.840
<i>I have your grandchild,</i>
<i>so don't waste my time...</i>

1:44:15.920 --> 1:44:17.640
So it's the same kidnapper in both cases?

1:44:17.720 --> 1:44:20.360
That I don't know whether
the kidnapper's the same or not,

1:44:20.440 --> 1:44:22.160
but the ransom call
is definitely the same.

1:44:22.240 --> 1:44:23.160
Exact same.

1:44:26.280 --> 1:44:31.480
How can a man speak in the same way
choosing the same words

1:44:32.120 --> 1:44:37.600
pause in the same places,
even after eight years?

1:44:40.840 --> 1:44:41.840
That's not possible.

1:44:47.200 --> 1:44:48.080
<i>Hello.</i>

1:44:48.520 --> 1:44:50.240
What's that sound?

1:44:50.680 --> 1:44:52.000
<i>Why did you call the police?</i>

1:44:52.080 --> 1:44:52.960
I guess it's a switch.

1:44:53.240 --> 1:44:54.600
<i>Why did you call the police?</i>

1:44:56.840 --> 1:45:00.320
Someone's playing the same ransom call
over the phone.

1:45:01.480 --> 1:45:05.240
Maybe it's the switch of an old Walkman.

1:45:07.080 --> 1:45:08.720
<i>I have your grandchild.</i>

1:45:08.800 --> 1:45:10.320
<i>So stop wasting my time.</i>

1:45:10.400 --> 1:45:13.280
<i>If you want to see him alive,</i>
<i>arrange two million by tomorrow morning.</i>

1:45:14.840 --> 1:45:16.880
There is a difference
in quality in both the calls.

1:45:18.920 --> 1:45:20.320
Is it because the tape is too old?

1:45:20.680 --> 1:45:24.640
No, no, quality of tapes
do not deteriorate as much due to storage

1:45:25.080 --> 1:45:27.160
as it might if you keep
playing them time and again.

1:45:27.240 --> 1:45:31.120
Someone is constantly telling
the child to say "grandpa."

1:45:31.800 --> 1:45:35.760
See if the voice matches
with anyone on the system.

1:46:35.960 --> 1:46:36.840
There's a match.

1:46:37.480 --> 1:46:38.400
With what?

1:46:38.480 --> 1:46:39.600
No one on the system.

1:46:40.480 --> 1:46:43.080
But with the voice on the old tape.

1:46:47.800 --> 1:46:49.160
-The kidnapper?
-No.

1:46:49.760 --> 1:46:52.400
The person who's asking
the kid to say grandpa.

1:46:53.640 --> 1:46:54.680
It's the same guy

1:46:54.760 --> 1:46:58.440
who received the ransom call
in the earlier kidnapping case.

1:47:02.360 --> 1:47:03.320
Grandpa.

1:47:06.000 --> 1:47:07.320
Grandpa, help.

1:47:08.360 --> 1:47:10.840
Grandpa, help!

1:47:11.240 --> 1:47:12.560
Loudly.

1:47:13.080 --> 1:47:16.400
He keeps listening to
the same old tape every night.

1:47:16.920 --> 1:47:19.000
<i>Grandpa! Grandpa!</i>

1:47:19.280 --> 1:47:20.520
<i>I am sorry, grandpa.</i>

1:47:21.360 --> 1:47:22.520
<i>I made a mistake.</i>

1:47:22.880 --> 1:47:25.560
<i>I will tell you.</i>

1:47:29.200 --> 1:47:30.240
This is a list of them.

1:47:31.520 --> 1:47:36.560
Have you ever heard anything
about them, or any records?

1:47:37.400 --> 1:47:38.320
Father...

1:47:39.040 --> 1:47:40.840
My daughter's made this card for you.

1:47:42.320 --> 1:47:43.240
You made this?

1:47:44.120 --> 1:47:45.360
It's really beautiful.

1:47:46.040 --> 1:47:47.800
<i>I'll always keep it with me.</i>

1:48:51.160 --> 1:48:52.120
Manohar Sinha.

1:49:27.720 --> 1:49:29.240
-Hey, welcome.
-Hello, papa.

1:49:30.560 --> 1:49:32.160
-Hello, Neeta. How are you?
-Hi, grandpa.

1:49:32.240 --> 1:49:33.480
I love you, grandpa.

1:49:33.960 --> 1:49:35.440
-How are you, Ronnie?
-I'm fine.

1:49:36.320 --> 1:49:37.280
Good to see you.

1:49:37.960 --> 1:49:39.800
-Okay, let's play football.
-Ready, mom.

1:49:39.880 --> 1:49:41.360
Ronnie, head-butt. Head-butt.

1:49:44.120 --> 1:49:45.120
Good one.

1:49:46.680 --> 1:49:48.000
You have become a pro.

1:50:03.360 --> 1:50:04.320
Hello.

1:50:08.120 --> 1:50:10.160
-Did you find anything?
<i>-We have found the location.</i>

1:50:10.240 --> 1:50:11.440
<i>The phone is not moving.</i>

1:50:22.040 --> 1:50:24.880
Come, on pass. Come on, pass me.

1:50:26.080 --> 1:50:28.320
Come on pass... Come on, pass me.

1:50:29.480 --> 1:50:30.440
Kick the ball.

1:50:33.240 --> 1:50:35.560
Come on, pass. Come on, pass me.

1:50:37.520 --> 1:50:38.960
Yes! Goal!

1:50:41.200 --> 1:50:42.680
Good to see you, Father Martin.

1:50:44.160 --> 1:50:45.840
I knew you would find me.

1:50:49.120 --> 1:50:51.840
-Ronnie, dear...
-Yes.

1:50:51.960 --> 1:50:54.480
Okay. Go get ready, son.

1:50:55.440 --> 1:50:57.160
This uncle will take you home.

1:50:57.800 --> 1:50:59.520
No, I don't want to go home.

1:50:59.600 --> 1:51:01.880
I want to stay here
and play football with you.

1:51:12.400 --> 1:51:17.240
So you knew that Manohar
had kidnapped Angela.

1:51:18.320 --> 1:51:20.560
And you've been planning
this ever since, right?

1:51:24.960 --> 1:51:28.200
I found the kidnapper, not you.

1:51:29.920 --> 1:51:33.520
That day, after we visited the Imambara,
you deserted me.

1:51:35.320 --> 1:51:37.280
<i>But I couldn't desert Angela.</i>

1:51:39.160 --> 1:51:41.120
<i>So I continued my search.</i>

1:52:36.240 --> 1:52:38.600
<i>The day I found him</i>
<i>I could have killed him,</i>

1:52:38.680 --> 1:52:40.120
<i>but would that be justice?</i>

1:52:41.920 --> 1:52:46.200
I would've had my revenge,
but not justice.

1:52:50.800 --> 1:52:53.680
And, so, I intentionally
started this story.

1:52:55.800 --> 1:52:59.760
Because I always knew that
the police will come to you.

1:53:02.160 --> 1:53:07.520
I took special care to make
the kidnapping seem like the earlier one.

1:53:47.360 --> 1:53:48.960
<i>Why did you call the police?</i>

1:53:49.080 --> 1:53:52.280
<i>Your grandchild is in my custody,</i>
<i>so don't waste my time.</i>

1:53:52.360 --> 1:53:55.480
<i>If you want to see him alive,</i>
<i>arrange two million by tomorrow morning.</i>

1:54:00.280 --> 1:54:01.240
What do you want?

1:54:02.920 --> 1:54:03.960
What are you going to do?

1:54:10.560 --> 1:54:12.760
I want a meeting with Manohar.

1:54:14.200 --> 1:54:16.200
No, I can't do that.

1:54:18.400 --> 1:54:19.240
It's not my call.

1:54:21.440 --> 1:54:22.440
Martin...

1:54:24.640 --> 1:54:27.240
No one else can arrange
this meeting other than you.

1:54:29.080 --> 1:54:29.920
Do it.

1:54:31.480 --> 1:54:34.120
And take Ronnie home.

1:54:35.520 --> 1:54:39.240
John Uncle, come on,
let's play football together.

1:55:06.760 --> 1:55:07.640
Manohar.

1:55:16.000 --> 1:55:20.360
Except for you, only one other man knew...

1:55:22.120 --> 1:55:26.480
that eight years ago
you kidnapped my Angela.

1:55:28.760 --> 1:55:29.680
And that is me.

1:57:45.280 --> 1:57:47.680
So you fled with the money.

1:57:50.920 --> 1:57:54.720
But you weren't sure
whether she's dead or not.

1:57:56.320 --> 1:57:58.120
That's why you erased all the evidence.

1:57:58.320 --> 1:58:03.600
You just removed all evidence.

1:58:18.360 --> 1:58:21.960
<i>It was clever of you</i>
<i>to borrow Kumar's black van.</i>

1:58:22.560 --> 1:58:24.480
The van couldn't have led anyone
directly to you

1:58:24.560 --> 1:58:27.040
because many people would hire it.

1:58:28.120 --> 1:58:28.960
But...

1:58:30.800 --> 1:58:31.800
Finally, one day...

1:58:34.360 --> 1:58:36.040
You ran out of luck.

1:58:39.320 --> 1:58:40.600
Your trunk was found.

1:58:42.200 --> 1:58:43.200
Then the pen.

1:58:46.080 --> 1:58:47.640
The... Pen.

1:58:56.480 --> 1:58:57.560
This pen.

1:59:02.400 --> 1:59:06.040
This pen led me to you.

1:59:07.320 --> 1:59:09.200
I didn't want to kill her.

1:59:10.960 --> 1:59:13.440
I only wanted to save my daughter Neeta.

1:59:14.240 --> 1:59:17.640
She needed immediate surgery,
and I didn't have the money, so I did it.

1:59:18.400 --> 1:59:20.200
Back then I was in
a desperate condition,

1:59:20.680 --> 1:59:23.960
I couldn't decide
what's right or wrong.

1:59:26.360 --> 1:59:30.520
And even after eight years
you didn't know what to do?

1:59:32.520 --> 1:59:34.840
The police thinks you have killed Ronnie.

1:59:36.560 --> 1:59:40.720
They are never going to
look for him anymore.

1:59:42.320 --> 1:59:46.800
But you want him to return safely,
don't you?

1:59:50.640 --> 1:59:51.600
Fine.

1:59:53.480 --> 1:59:55.400
I admit I wronged you.

1:59:56.800 --> 2:00:00.680
So tell me, how can I rectify my mistake?

2:00:03.280 --> 2:00:04.280
What must I do?

2:00:17.640 --> 2:00:18.880
Manohar has confessed.

2:00:23.680 --> 2:00:26.880
Sarita, Manohar has confessed
to both the kidnappings.

2:00:27.200 --> 2:00:29.400
And he also gave us Ronnie's location.

2:00:33.200 --> 2:00:35.120
<i>The star</i>

2:00:38.240 --> 2:00:43.880
<i>Neither relented nor feared</i>

2:00:45.760 --> 2:00:48.520
<i>A ray of light</i>

2:00:52.760 --> 2:00:58.480
<i>Kept him alive</i>
<i>Kept him alive</i>

2:00:58.840 --> 2:01:05.120
<i>Clinging to the few strands of life</i>

2:01:05.960 --> 2:01:10.920
<i>He kept saying</i>

2:01:11.680 --> 2:01:17.280
<i>I have the right to burn</i>

2:01:18.200 --> 2:01:22.920
<i>I have the right to live</i>

2:01:24.720 --> 2:01:30.600
<i>I have a right to the skies</i>

2:01:31.320 --> 2:01:36.120
<i>I'll take what's my right</i>

2:01:37.920 --> 2:01:42.720
<i>I'll take what's my right</i>

2:01:43.720 --> 2:01:46.840
<i>I promise</i>

2:02:12.040 --> 2:02:15.160
<i>Drops of my blood</i>

2:02:17.000 --> 2:02:22.800
<i>Are still warm</i>

2:02:25.280 --> 2:02:32.240
<i>I have an unfinished duty</i>

2:02:37.520 --> 2:02:40.680
<i>I've been counting each passing day</i>

2:02:41.400 --> 2:02:47.040
<i>Year after year</i>
<i>I've been counting them</i>

2:02:48.000 --> 2:02:50.720
<i>I've been counting them</i>

2:02:50.800 --> 2:02:57.600
<i>I've been clinging to twigs of courage</i>

2:03:01.040 --> 2:03:03.280
<i>And kept saying</i>

2:03:03.440 --> 2:03:09.280
<i>I've the right to burn</i>

2:03:10.200 --> 2:03:14.800
<i>I've the right to live</i>

2:03:16.640 --> 2:03:22.040
<i>I've the right to the sky</i>

2:03:23.080 --> 2:03:28.440
<i>I will take what's mine</i>

2:03:29.880 --> 2:03:34.800
<i>I will take what's mine</i>

2:03:35.680 --> 2:03:37.800
<i>I promise</i>

2:03:57.720 --> 2:04:04.680
<i>I know that I'll die one day</i>
<i>I'll die</i>

2:04:10.880 --> 2:04:17.760
<i>But until I die I decide how I live</i>

2:04:23.200 --> 2:04:30.160
<i>Steely is the resolve</i>
<i>Of this mortal frame of dust</i>

2:04:32.400 --> 2:04:38.000
<i>I have the right to burn</i>

2:04:38.880 --> 2:04:43.880
<i>I have the right to live</i>

2:04:45.400 --> 2:04:51.280
<i>I have a right to the skies</i>

2:04:52.040 --> 2:04:56.960
<i>I will take what's mine</i>

2:04:58.480 --> 2:05:03.640
<i>I will take what's mine</i>

2:05:04.640 --> 2:05:06.800
<i>Wait and watch</i>
