00:11.678 --> 00:13.942
Son of a gun!

00:18.652 --> 00:22.110
Don't use the upstairs bathroom. It's
backed up. I have to snake the pipes.

00:22.289 --> 00:24.621
-Where's the leftover pizza?
-Fridge, second shelf.

00:24.791 --> 00:27.385
Or you could nuke
the chili for dinner.

00:27.561 --> 00:28.789
Clark?

00:30.264 --> 00:32.858
Some clue you actually heard me.

00:33.033 --> 00:35.797
Upstairs bathroom off-limits
after nuclear chili dinner.

00:35.969 --> 00:38.938
Glad to see your hearing
hasn't changed.

00:39.106 --> 00:42.598
Clark, can I get
a hand out here, please?

00:48.182 --> 00:49.672
Son, would you--?

00:49.850 --> 00:51.875
-Sure.
-Thanks.

00:53.287 --> 00:57.280
Sure picked one heck of a day
to snap an exhaust hanger.

00:57.457 --> 01:01.416
I left the number of our hotel on
the nightstand. I think that's everything.

01:01.595 --> 01:05.929
That ought to do it.
I'm definitely raising your allowance.

01:06.099 --> 01:07.691
-lf you need anything--
-Call.

01:08.035 --> 01:10.765
Mom, it's a couple of nights
in Metropolis. I'll be fine.

01:10.938 --> 01:15.238
<i>I'm sure he'll be fine.
And soon, madame, so shall we be.</i>

01:15.409 --> 01:18.503
I almost forgot. Sorry.

01:21.215 --> 01:22.443
Happy anniversary.

01:22.849 --> 01:25.841
Sweetheart, bye-bye.

01:28.722 --> 01:30.815
Clark, thanks for the card.

01:30.991 --> 01:33.118
Think fast!

01:35.000 --> 01:41.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

01:53.814 --> 01:56.214
Good night, little one.

02:46.533 --> 02:48.330
Don't worry.

02:48.502 --> 02:51.027
Daddy's gonna get better.

03:13.827 --> 03:15.624
Hello?

03:15.796 --> 03:17.855
Is someone there?

03:19.666 --> 03:23.602
It's okay, honey. It's just thunder.

04:08.749 --> 04:10.114
Will!

04:13.587 --> 04:16.385
Earl? What are you doing here?

04:16.555 --> 04:18.853
I need to see Lionel Luthor.

04:19.259 --> 04:22.228
-I know he's here.
-Sorry, man, you know I can't let you in.

04:22.562 --> 04:27.090
They did something to me
at his plant in Smallville.

04:27.267 --> 04:30.600
See, that's the talk that got
yourself canned, all right?

04:30.771 --> 04:36.038
-lf you've got a problem, get some help.
-I've tried. They can't do anything.

04:36.209 --> 04:37.801
It's getting worse.

04:37.978 --> 04:40.139
Please, let me in.

04:40.313 --> 04:43.476
Earl, don't make me call security,
all right?

04:43.650 --> 04:46.915
Just go home and dry off.

04:56.129 --> 04:58.120
What the hell?

04:58.298 --> 04:59.856
Earl?

05:03.270 --> 05:06.171
What the hell you doing, Earl?!

05:09.776 --> 05:14.406
-lf I don't get an answer, I'll die.
-No, we gotta get you to a doctor!

05:14.581 --> 05:18.108
Look, they can't do anything.
Nobody can.

06:42.702 --> 06:45.296
What will you do now that you're
officially home alone?

06:45.472 --> 06:47.531
I was thinking of having
a few people over.

06:47.707 --> 06:51.609
Do my ears deceive me or is Clark Kent
actually suggesting a party?

06:51.778 --> 06:55.509
Small gathering. You guys,
a few other people, maybe Lana.

06:55.682 --> 06:58.412
With or without her posable
action-figure boyfriend?

06:58.585 --> 07:00.246
Eight o'clock.

07:00.420 --> 07:04.356
-And remember, the keyword is "small."
-Small.

07:12.766 --> 07:16.202
So this is what you'd call
a small gathering, right?

07:16.369 --> 07:18.860
Do you even recognize
half these people?

07:19.039 --> 07:21.200
Watch the glass--

07:33.453 --> 07:35.887
Dude, I think I'm gonna hurl.

07:54.307 --> 07:55.706
Thanks.

08:08.788 --> 08:10.688
Pretty cool party!

08:10.857 --> 08:13.621
Lana. Thanks.

08:15.562 --> 08:17.086
It's kind of impromptu.

08:17.263 --> 08:20.198
Sometimes you just have to kick back
and blow off some steam.

08:20.367 --> 08:24.633
If I had 100 people trashing my house,
I'd be a little freaked out.

08:25.238 --> 08:27.798
After the first few dishes,
you get used to it.

08:28.308 --> 08:30.640
I don't think I'd be
brave enough to risk it.

08:30.810 --> 08:33.836
I don't know, Lana.
I bet you're braver than you think.

08:35.115 --> 08:37.708
You flying solo tonight?

08:37.984 --> 08:41.351
You mean, what am I doing here
without Whitney?

08:41.988 --> 08:45.515
I am capable of enjoying myself
without him.

08:48.495 --> 08:49.894
Fireworks!

08:51.164 --> 08:55.897
-You're full of surprises tonight, Clark.
-Tell me about it.

09:00.707 --> 09:02.504
Clark, man, how cool is this?

09:02.876 --> 09:06.004
Pete, why didn't you just call
the cops? It'd be easier.

09:06.179 --> 09:08.340
I can't claim credit.
It wasn't my idea.

09:08.515 --> 09:10.244
It was mine.

09:11.184 --> 09:13.744
Call it a party gift.
I hope you like it.

09:13.920 --> 09:16.889
-It's great, it's just--
-Forget the police. It's covered.

09:17.090 --> 09:19.558
This kind of party can make
or break a reputation.

09:19.726 --> 09:22.354
I wanted to make sure yours was a hit.

09:25.732 --> 09:29.532
-I hear you're taking a tour of my plant.
-It's a class field trip.

09:29.703 --> 09:32.536
-What'd you do wrong?
-It's that bad, huh?

09:33.406 --> 09:38.275
Sorry I took so long.
Someone overflowed the bathroom.

09:38.645 --> 09:40.340
I'm officially dead.

09:55.295 --> 09:56.523
There's no answer.

09:56.696 --> 10:00.393
He's fine, he's fine.
We have to trust him, Martha.

10:00.567 --> 10:03.627
-I do, but I still worry.
-I know.

10:03.803 --> 10:05.134
Metropolis....

10:05.305 --> 10:07.136
Do you--? Do you miss it?

10:09.609 --> 10:12.339
-Sometimes.
-Yeah.

10:12.679 --> 10:16.513
But I didn't move to Smallville
for action and glamour.

10:16.683 --> 10:22.144
I moved because a certain man
told me we'd never be rich...

10:22.322 --> 10:25.917
...or travel the world,
but he'd always love me.

10:26.092 --> 10:29.027
How could I pass up
an offer like that?

10:43.810 --> 10:48.440
-Whitney, what are you doing here?
-Looking for you.

10:50.550 --> 10:53.246
Why didn't you tell me
you were coming here?

10:53.419 --> 10:57.583
It was kind of last-minute. I didn't
realize I needed your permission.

10:57.757 --> 11:00.123
Lana, can we talk outside?

11:04.898 --> 11:06.525
Oh, my gosh! Did--?

11:08.501 --> 11:09.729
Lana, what's going on?

11:09.903 --> 11:13.168
I told you when we got back together
that I needed some breathing room.

11:13.339 --> 11:15.500
So you sneak off to a party
without me?

11:15.675 --> 11:18.701
I didn't sneak. I walked.

11:18.878 --> 11:21.346
And why are you mad at me?

11:21.514 --> 11:24.278
Is it because it's Clark's party?

11:25.018 --> 11:28.476
I'm starting to get the feeling
that you don't trust me.

11:37.330 --> 11:38.888
Clark!

11:39.065 --> 11:41.260
You better get out here.

11:45.805 --> 11:48.638
Kent, get up here.

12:11.598 --> 12:13.498
-Got him!
-Earl.

12:13.666 --> 12:14.928
Back off, I know him.

12:19.272 --> 12:21.900
Earl, what are you doing here?

12:22.242 --> 12:25.905
I came to see your dad.
He's the only one I can trust.

12:27.146 --> 12:28.704
He's out of town.

12:32.852 --> 12:34.683
What's wrong with you?

12:43.863 --> 12:44.887
I'll call an ambulance.

12:52.205 --> 12:55.834
-This guy should be in a detox center.
-He's not on drugs, Chloe.

12:56.009 --> 12:58.034
Then why was he shaking like a junkie?

12:58.211 --> 13:00.338
Earl worked on the farm
for six seasons.

13:00.513 --> 13:03.573
I spent 12 hours a day
with the guy in the fields.

13:03.750 --> 13:08.346
He even tried to teach me how to play
guitar. He says it impresses women.

13:08.521 --> 13:11.786
We're all a sucker for a guy
with a six-string.

13:12.025 --> 13:14.516
How come I've never heard you play?

13:14.694 --> 13:19.097
I kept snapping the guitar strings.
I think Earl got sick of replacing them.

13:19.265 --> 13:21.324
Just because you spend time
with someone...

13:21.501 --> 13:24.595
...doesn't mean you know
their darkest secrets.

13:25.805 --> 13:28.569
-He was like family.
-Then why'd he leave?

13:28.741 --> 13:31.107
He took a job at the LuthorCorp plant.

13:31.277 --> 13:34.440
It was full-time,
and the pay was better.

13:36.182 --> 13:40.243
-Where can we find Earl Jenkins?
-Exam Room 3, down the hall.

13:40.420 --> 13:43.981
Excuse me. I'm a friend of Earl's.
Is he in some kind of trouble?

13:44.157 --> 13:46.057
Oh, yeah.

13:46.225 --> 13:48.386
We need help in here!

13:58.771 --> 14:00.398
Earl!

15:21.754 --> 15:24.018
Hi. You're home early.

15:24.190 --> 15:28.524
We called six times last night,
spoke with six different people...

15:28.694 --> 15:30.628
...none of whom knew who you were.

15:30.797 --> 15:33.823
It was supposed to be
an intimate occasion.

15:34.367 --> 15:37.336
-Clark, where have you been?
-The hospital.

15:37.737 --> 15:41.036
-That's it. I'm never leaving home again.
-Who got hurt?

15:41.207 --> 15:43.607
Nobody, but I found
Earl Jenkins hiding in the loft.

15:43.776 --> 15:47.678
He was looking for you, Dad.
He's all messed up.

15:47.847 --> 15:51.510
-What's the matter with Earl?
-I don't know. He's wanted for murder.

15:51.684 --> 15:53.151
Earl?

15:54.153 --> 15:55.381
What'd he say for himself?

15:55.555 --> 15:57.853
-I couldn't get close.
-How come, the police?

15:58.024 --> 16:02.393
No. Because when I got near him,
I got sick.

16:02.962 --> 16:04.395
It was weird.

16:04.564 --> 16:09.399
Every time I stood next to him,
it got worse. It's kind of like--

16:10.036 --> 16:11.901
Like what?

16:13.005 --> 16:16.600
It's kind of like the way I feel
around meteor fragments.

16:29.422 --> 16:31.219
What's wrong with him?

16:31.390 --> 16:35.292
Well, to be honest,
I haven't the faintest idea.

16:35.461 --> 16:39.830
It's amazing his body's been able
to survive the seizures this long.

16:40.933 --> 16:43.493
Take a look at the x-rays.

16:45.071 --> 16:48.802
It looks like mineral poisoning,
but it's not a mineral I've seen before.

16:49.008 --> 16:50.532
Is that why he's shaking so hard?

16:50.710 --> 16:52.803
Mineral fragments are embedded
under his skin.

16:52.979 --> 16:56.210
-His body is trying to push them out.
-How did they get there?

16:56.382 --> 16:59.943
He claims there was an explosion
at the LuthorCorp plant six months ago.

17:00.119 --> 17:03.088
-I didn't hear about that.
-That's because it didn't happen.

17:03.256 --> 17:08.250
I pulled the plant's safety records.
I checked with OSHA and the EPA.

17:10.730 --> 17:13.926
-Can I go in and talk to him by myself?
-Better hurry up.

17:14.099 --> 17:17.762
Metropolis P.D. will be here any minute
to transfer him back to the city.

17:17.936 --> 17:19.336
Thanks.

17:20.973 --> 17:23.441
-I wanna go with you.
-No.

17:23.608 --> 17:27.067
Listen, you said that you felt sick
when you got around him, right?

17:27.246 --> 17:30.409
I bet what he was exposed to
has to do with those meteor rocks.

17:30.583 --> 17:33.484
I don't want you passing out
around here.

17:33.653 --> 17:36.952
It'd bring us a whole other set
of problems.

17:44.063 --> 17:45.462
Jonathan.

17:46.365 --> 17:47.992
Am I glad to see you.

17:49.101 --> 17:50.864
Hey, look.

17:58.211 --> 18:01.146
Clark.
Can you hear me?

18:02.448 --> 18:04.143
<i>I'm sorry. I didn't mean to--</i>

18:04.350 --> 18:06.477
<i>I'm fine. Don't worry about it.</i>

18:12.425 --> 18:17.419
All right, Earl, what's going on?
I can't believe you'd wanna kill anybody.

18:17.597 --> 18:22.125
It was an accident.
I was trying to see Lionel Luthor.

18:22.902 --> 18:26.235
-Why?
-Find out what they used on Level 3.

18:28.007 --> 18:30.669
Earl, you're not making any sense.

18:31.377 --> 18:34.278
When I got that job
at the Smallville plant...

18:34.447 --> 18:37.007
...I was assigned to clean Level 3.

18:37.183 --> 18:40.710
They were doing these
hush-hush crop experiments.

18:40.886 --> 18:45.255
A new kind of fertilizer supposed
to make corn grow twice as fast.

18:45.424 --> 18:48.052
There was something unstable
in that fertilizer.

18:48.327 --> 18:51.524
There was a huge explosion.
I was cleaning at the time.

18:51.697 --> 18:54.257
This stuff, it got under my skin.

18:55.101 --> 18:57.501
And the next thing I know...

18:57.670 --> 19:01.265
...they shut it all down,
and I was transferred to Metropolis.

19:01.440 --> 19:05.206
Then two months ago,
the jitters started.

19:05.745 --> 19:08.543
-Did you see a doctor?
-I must have seen 50.

19:08.714 --> 19:10.807
<i>But nobody could tell me
what was wrong.</i>

19:10.983 --> 19:13.508
They needed to know
what I was exposed to.

19:13.686 --> 19:18.316
But when I went back to the plant,
they told me that Level 3 didn't exist.

19:18.491 --> 19:20.755
That it never had.

19:20.960 --> 19:25.294
I got to find out what they were using.
That's why I need your help.

19:25.464 --> 19:27.261
You gotta get me out of here.

19:27.700 --> 19:30.134
Earl, you're wanted for murder.

19:30.303 --> 19:34.262
You don't understand. I can't control it.
I'm running out of time.

19:34.440 --> 19:36.772
The jitters are getting worse.

19:36.942 --> 19:42.005
It's already cost me my job,
my marriage, my baby.

19:42.181 --> 19:45.947
I gotta get back into that plant,
or I'm gonna die.

19:48.788 --> 19:50.187
Help me.

19:54.660 --> 19:56.252
You get some rest, Earl.

20:00.499 --> 20:02.433
My baby.

20:04.370 --> 20:07.771
-Do you think he's telling the truth?
-I have no idea.

20:08.441 --> 20:11.899
I have a field trip to LuthorCorp today.
Maybe I could look around.

20:12.078 --> 20:15.605
<i>I know you're worried, but Earl has
more trouble than he can handle.</i>

20:15.781 --> 20:20.616
<i>And I don't even know if he's in his right
mind. So please, don't do anything.</i>

20:42.541 --> 20:46.978
Mommy, I don't wanna go to the doctor's.
They're gonna give me a shot.

20:47.146 --> 20:50.877
-They're not gonna give you a shot.
-That's what you said last time.

20:52.451 --> 20:53.850
Mommy!

21:09.435 --> 21:13.565
Hello, everybody, I'm Gabe Sullivan,
plant manager and proud father.

21:13.739 --> 21:15.570
-Hi, sweetheart.
-Hi, Dad.

21:15.808 --> 21:19.005
Welcome to LuthorCorp:
"Where we give a crap."

21:19.178 --> 21:20.702
Okay, somebody kill me now.

21:20.880 --> 21:22.973
Little fertilizer humor there.

21:23.149 --> 21:24.377
Before we go inside...

21:24.550 --> 21:27.383
...I need you to remove all
your cell phones, pagers, jewelry.

21:27.553 --> 21:31.819
Anything that jangles, dangles or rings
has to go in these plastic trays.

21:32.024 --> 21:34.015
Any other questions?
Yes.

21:34.193 --> 21:37.924
I heard there was a third level
to the plant. Is that true?

21:38.097 --> 21:41.498
Yeah, yeah. That's where we do
the alien autopsies.

21:41.667 --> 21:44.397
-I think we'd better get started.
-Don't encourage him.

21:44.570 --> 21:46.333
This way, everybody.

21:46.505 --> 21:49.440
All right, people,
let's stay together.

22:16.702 --> 22:20.229
No. No. No!

22:20.406 --> 22:23.375
This can't be. This can't be.
This can't be.

22:23.542 --> 22:25.840
This can't be happening.

22:29.348 --> 22:31.179
Where is it?

22:31.350 --> 22:33.511
Where is it?

22:34.019 --> 22:36.351
Where's the elevator?

22:39.492 --> 22:44.623
Watch out for these babies.
260 degrees, they get hot.

22:45.264 --> 22:47.562
All right, stay together, please.

22:56.342 --> 22:59.140
This is it.
The plant's mission control.

22:59.545 --> 23:04.278
100,000 tons of animal waste
to process here every year.

23:04.450 --> 23:08.216
Trust me.
The results can be pretty explosive.

23:08.387 --> 23:13.791
So if any of you had beans for lunch,
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

23:14.260 --> 23:16.820
Among his peers,
he's considered witty.

23:17.596 --> 23:19.359
Where's Clark?

23:23.202 --> 23:25.796
What the heck? Excuse me.

23:31.710 --> 23:33.473
Don't move!

23:35.247 --> 23:37.272
Take me to Level 3.

23:37.449 --> 23:39.610
-Dad.
-Now!

23:45.558 --> 23:47.753
When we send our kids
on a field trip...

23:47.927 --> 23:51.556
...we'd like to believe
that they're gonna be safe.

23:53.499 --> 23:55.262
Lex Luthor!

24:04.377 --> 24:06.277
Let these two in, just these two.

24:06.446 --> 24:09.074
We'll check on
Derrick and Jeff for you.

24:09.248 --> 24:10.476
What's going on here?

24:10.650 --> 24:14.245
There's a lunatic inside demanding to
be taken to some place called Level 3.

24:14.420 --> 24:17.446
We've evacuated the plant,
but he's taken the students hostage.

24:17.623 --> 24:20.023
-Is anyone hurt?
-Not yet.

24:20.193 --> 24:22.957
-What's his name?
-Earl Jenkins.

24:23.996 --> 24:26.624
I know Earl Jenkins.
He used to work for us.

24:26.799 --> 24:29.165
Well, what's he doing in my plant?

24:29.335 --> 24:32.930
He claims that LuthorCorp is doing
some crop experiments...

24:33.106 --> 24:35.597
...on some secret Level 3,
and that's what made him sick.

24:35.775 --> 24:38.835
He's convinced it's the only place
he can get a cure.

24:39.011 --> 24:42.742
We've got a serious problem
because there is no Level 3.

24:49.722 --> 24:51.280
Where's Clark?

25:13.679 --> 25:16.477
I swear, I don't know anything
about Level 3.

25:16.649 --> 25:18.446
-You're lying.
-He's not lying!

25:20.853 --> 25:24.880
I found these blueprints.
There is no Level 3.

25:43.943 --> 25:48.312
Every night, I go down to Level 2...

25:48.481 --> 25:52.178
...follow the red pipes
down that long hallway...

25:52.985 --> 25:55.453
...go to the door, I open it...

25:55.621 --> 25:59.887
...and I take the elevator down
to Level 3!

26:03.696 --> 26:06.256
You're just like everybody else.

26:06.432 --> 26:09.458
Get over there and you sit down!

26:31.424 --> 26:33.358
Who's that?

26:33.693 --> 26:34.921
My father.

26:43.002 --> 26:47.632
-Mr. Luthor, we have a hostage situation.
-I was briefed on my way down.

26:47.873 --> 26:49.272
Lex!

26:49.942 --> 26:52.467
-How did you allow this to happen?
-I didn't allow--

26:52.645 --> 26:54.806
-Then how did this man get inside?
-I think--

26:54.981 --> 26:58.747
-You think? Why don't you know?
-Can we focus on what's important?

26:58.918 --> 27:02.285
-We've got innocent kids in there.
-This is Jonathan Kent.

27:02.455 --> 27:05.720
It's been a long time,
but I never forget a face.

27:06.626 --> 27:09.652
Kent's son is inside.
They know the gunman personally.

27:09.829 --> 27:12.059
What's your assessment
of this lunatic?

27:12.231 --> 27:13.960
He's sick, he's desperate...

27:14.133 --> 27:17.227
...and he blames your plant
for his condition.

27:17.570 --> 27:19.663
This Level 3 nonsense....

27:20.072 --> 27:24.873
I've assured everyone there is
no Level 3. That is the truth, isn't it?

27:25.278 --> 27:26.802
Of course, it is.

27:29.215 --> 27:31.979
People's lives are at stake.
What will you do about it?

27:32.151 --> 27:34.381
I'm going to let SWAT
do their job.

27:34.553 --> 27:37.420
When he makes a mistake,
they'll move in.

27:37.757 --> 27:39.418
What about the kids?

27:39.592 --> 27:42.288
You need to get on the phone
and talk to him!

27:42.461 --> 27:45.021
Mrs. Kent, I understand how you feel.

27:45.197 --> 27:47.688
I want everyone to walk out
of there alive too.

27:47.867 --> 27:51.701
-But I do not negotiate with terrorists.
-He's not a terrorist!

27:51.871 --> 27:53.862
He's sick and he needs help!

27:54.040 --> 27:57.441
If you won't talk to him,
then Jonathan will!

27:58.144 --> 27:59.839
You're not the one he blames.

28:00.446 --> 28:01.708
Is he, Dad?

28:07.253 --> 28:08.584
<i>Gabe, it's Luthor.</i>

28:08.754 --> 28:10.619
Lionel Luthor.

28:11.290 --> 28:13.190
Speaker.

28:16.262 --> 28:18.423
Mr. Luthor.

28:19.231 --> 28:21.756
I've finally got your attention,
haven't I?

28:21.934 --> 28:26.064
Earl, why don't you come out?
We've got a lot to talk about.

28:27.440 --> 28:30.534
Just tell me what you were
using down on Level 3.

28:30.710 --> 28:32.337
You're sick, Earl.

28:32.511 --> 28:35.708
<i>Let everyone go,
we'll get you help.</i>

28:41.387 --> 28:43.821
-Clark!
-Are you okay?

28:50.096 --> 28:51.495
Oh, no.

28:52.264 --> 28:56.064
See what you made me do?
See what you made me--?

28:58.571 --> 29:01.233
<i>See what you made me do?</i>

29:03.075 --> 29:07.136
Way to go, Dad.
I see you haven't lost your touch.

29:07.313 --> 29:11.579
The methane gas valve just broke.
The whole place is gonna go up.

29:11.751 --> 29:14.379
-We need to do something.
-That's not a good idea.

29:14.587 --> 29:19.115
The man's nuts. He's not listening
to the cops, and that gas is gonna blow.

29:19.291 --> 29:22.385
-He's sick, but still strong.
-I don't want you to get hurt.

29:22.561 --> 29:25.428
I'm not putting my life
in that man's hands.

29:25.598 --> 29:28.863
The two of us can take him.
How about it, Clark?

29:32.371 --> 29:33.804
I can't.

29:37.810 --> 29:39.505
It's okay.

29:42.915 --> 29:44.576
Whitney.

29:45.184 --> 29:48.642
<i>I trusted you. You told me you
were trying to help people.</i>

29:49.321 --> 29:50.549
What are you doing?

29:53.659 --> 29:55.058
Get back!

29:57.263 --> 29:59.254
<i>It's all your fault, Luthor.</i>

30:00.666 --> 30:03.362
We've got shots fired,
one hostage down. Full alert.

30:03.536 --> 30:04.764
What was he thinking?

30:04.937 --> 30:08.338
He's a teenager who's been waiting
for someone to take the initiative.

30:08.507 --> 30:10.907
There's a hostage situation
and a potential bomb.

30:11.076 --> 30:14.739
-Somebody's gotta do something.
-You're right. I'm going in.

30:14.914 --> 30:18.577
Lex, don't be foolhardy.
This is no time for mock-heroics.

30:18.751 --> 30:21.015
You said this is my plant.
It's my call.

30:21.187 --> 30:23.451
I won't allow it, Lex.

30:24.156 --> 30:25.817
Don't ever do that again.

30:25.991 --> 30:28.323
Take your positions.

30:28.561 --> 30:30.495
Tell him Lex Luthor's coming
to see him.

30:30.663 --> 30:33.291
-I wouldn't advise that, sir.
-Make the call.

30:33.466 --> 30:35.195
Give me your vest.

30:49.315 --> 30:53.183
What kind of man sends his own kid
to do his dirty work?

30:53.352 --> 30:57.948
I'm not doing anybody's dirty work.
This is my plant.

30:58.824 --> 31:01.520
-How is he?
-He needs a doctor.

31:03.596 --> 31:06.724
What are we gonna do
about these kids, Earl?

31:07.299 --> 31:09.529
I never meant to hurt anybody.

31:09.702 --> 31:12.694
I tried talking to your father,
but he wouldn't listen to me.

31:12.872 --> 31:14.863
I know the feeling.

31:21.714 --> 31:23.113
Earl...

31:24.049 --> 31:27.382
...you say that everybody's
been lying to you.

31:27.553 --> 31:29.919
I'm gonna tell you the truth.

31:30.089 --> 31:32.387
My father doesn't care about you.

31:32.558 --> 31:34.788
He doesn't care about anybody
in this room.

31:34.960 --> 31:38.726
Because if we all die,
his PR firm will spin it.

31:38.898 --> 31:42.061
His insurance company will pay,
and you will go down as the bad guy.

31:42.568 --> 31:46.834
I'm not the bad guy.
I'm just trying to get better.

31:47.006 --> 31:50.134
How are you gonna get better
by killing a bunch of kids?

31:51.944 --> 31:56.381
If you let everybody go,
I'll take you to Level 3.

32:00.653 --> 32:01.881
You stop lying.

32:02.488 --> 32:05.321
Let them go,
and I'll show you where it is.

32:06.825 --> 32:09.919
Earl, trust me. I'm a man of my word.

32:13.065 --> 32:14.293
Get out.

32:15.367 --> 32:19.565
Get out. Get out! Everybody, get out!

32:25.878 --> 32:30.679
-Do you really know where it is?
-Yeah, it's in his imagination.

32:30.849 --> 32:34.046
There is no Level 3, Clark.
Now, get out of here.

32:36.455 --> 32:37.922
Clark.

32:39.291 --> 32:42.158
Come on.
Come on, man, let's go!

32:45.698 --> 32:49.691
-Come on, keep moving!
-This way, kids. This way.

32:49.969 --> 32:51.561
The kids are coming out.

32:51.737 --> 32:55.229
-Oh, Jonathan!
-Come on. They'll come out over here.

32:55.407 --> 32:58.706
We need to bring down the fire doors.
The gas levels are too high.

32:58.877 --> 33:02.438
Your son will be sealed inside.
I'm sorry, sir.

33:06.585 --> 33:08.177
Do it.

33:14.093 --> 33:17.460
-Come on, man, we gotta go!
-Don't worry about me!

33:24.603 --> 33:26.537
-Pete.
-Whitney, did you see Clark?

33:26.705 --> 33:30.106
Hey, Pete.
Where's Clark?

33:30.275 --> 33:34.974
He's back inside, Mrs. Kent.
I tried to stop him. I'm sorry--

33:35.180 --> 33:36.511
You have to open the doors.

33:36.949 --> 33:41.113
They're safety locked and can't be
opened until the gas levels go down.

33:41.286 --> 33:43.846
My son is still in there!

33:44.690 --> 33:46.021
So is mine.

34:18.623 --> 34:20.114
We're running out of time.

34:20.292 --> 34:24.991
All right, I've done my part.
Now it's time for you to do yours.

34:25.164 --> 34:28.929
Earl, there is no Level 3.
It's all in your head.

34:32.905 --> 34:37.205
I should have never trusted you.
You Luthors are all the same.

34:38.310 --> 34:43.509
<i>I found Level 3. They built a wall in front
of the elevator, but it's still here.</i>

34:43.681 --> 34:47.208
-Stop playing with me!
-Get out of the building, Clark!

34:47.386 --> 34:51.447
<i>Earl, it's here!
Don't you want to see it? I promise.</i>

34:54.927 --> 34:58.055
Come on, I want you to see the truth.

35:01.100 --> 35:02.590
Come on.

35:03.001 --> 35:04.832
Come on, come on!

35:17.316 --> 35:18.749
-Sir.
-Hold on.

35:18.917 --> 35:21.681
The gas pressure is beginning to drop.

35:22.488 --> 35:25.423
-How did that happen?
-I have no idea.

35:33.065 --> 35:37.161
Son of a bitch!
How do you explain that?

35:37.936 --> 35:39.301
I can't.

35:53.452 --> 35:57.616
Two buttons. Two levels.
I'm sorry, all right?

36:19.912 --> 36:22.142
I told you it was here.

36:27.953 --> 36:29.477
Where is it?

36:29.988 --> 36:32.957
Where is everything?
There used to be a--

36:33.692 --> 36:37.321
It was a field of corn
with sprayers all over it.

36:37.496 --> 36:40.693
And every night,
they'd spray this green mist on it.

36:41.200 --> 36:43.760
What have you done with it?

36:44.069 --> 36:45.536
What have you done with it?!

36:45.704 --> 36:46.932
I don't know.

36:47.840 --> 36:49.273
They lied to me too, Earl.

36:50.642 --> 36:53.304
I had no idea this was here.

36:54.446 --> 36:56.209
Earl!

36:56.515 --> 36:59.678
Let's go back upstairs
and talk about this.

36:59.852 --> 37:04.983
It's all gone. How am I gonna get better
if I don't know what poisoned me?

37:05.157 --> 37:08.558
I didn't know about this place.
You gotta believe me.

37:08.727 --> 37:12.493
-I believe you, Lex.
-He's lying! He's just like his father!

37:35.554 --> 37:37.317
Clark!

37:50.669 --> 37:53.069
No! Oh, God!

37:58.410 --> 37:59.968
Clark!

38:32.644 --> 38:34.635
Get to the elevator!

39:31.703 --> 39:34.263
Clark, how did you pull us up?

39:39.177 --> 39:40.701
I don't know.

39:41.146 --> 39:42.841
Adrenaline, I guess.

39:54.259 --> 39:57.524
I've never been so happy
to see you in my life!

40:00.766 --> 40:02.996
-You lied to me.
-No. When?

40:03.168 --> 40:06.365
I said Level 3 wasn't on any plans.
It wasn't.

40:06.538 --> 40:09.632
-It's plausible deniability.
-What were you doing down there?

40:09.808 --> 40:13.642
It doesn't matter. It was a failure.
We closed the door and moved on.

40:13.812 --> 40:17.339
-You almost got me killed.
-No, you almost got yourself killed.

40:17.516 --> 40:19.313
It was your call, remember?

40:19.484 --> 40:21.145
-Mr. Luthor!
-I'll handle this.

40:21.319 --> 40:23.150
What can you tell us about Level 3?

40:23.321 --> 40:28.315
I think you're referring to a redundant
storage area at the base of the plant.

40:28.693 --> 40:33.426
Mr. Jenkins is a very sick man who
desperately needs medical attention.

40:33.598 --> 40:35.498
That's why my father
and I have pledged...

40:35.667 --> 40:38.830
...to find Mr. Jenkins
the best medical care possible.

40:39.004 --> 40:40.494
He was a LuthorCorp employee.

40:40.672 --> 40:45.837
Here at LuthorCorp, we always put
family first. Isn't that right, Dad?

40:46.011 --> 40:48.878
Is it true the government is
going to shut you down?

40:49.047 --> 40:53.677
No more questions, please. My son
has been through quite an ordeal today.
