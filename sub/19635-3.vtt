<i>Previously on Broadchurch...</i>

00:02.400 --> 00:04.038
Trish Winterman
of West Flintcombe

00:04.038 --> 00:05.518
has made an allegation of rape.

00:05.519 --> 00:07.399
What, so you come
for the cab driver?

00:07.400 --> 00:10.679
- Where were you Saturday night?
- I was out with my girlfriend.

00:10.680 --> 00:13.238
- Wessex Police. Who are you?
- Ed Burnett. This is my shop.

00:13.239 --> 00:15.720
Why did you have a fight
with Ed Burnett at the party?

00:17.119 --> 00:19.279
Don't you think you should be
telling me a little bit -

00:19.280 --> 00:20.880
I mean, anything -
about what's happened?

00:22.000 --> 00:28.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:42.200 --> 00:44.118
When did the message come in?

00:44.119 --> 00:45.878
About an hour ago.

00:45.879 --> 00:47.999
I told her to call you.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.119
You did the right thing.

00:52.119 --> 00:54.318
She's gonna be alright, isn't she?

00:54.319 --> 00:57.839
Yeah. It will take time.

00:59.079 --> 01:01.158
It's from him. I know it is.

01:01.159 --> 01:03.838
He's got my number.
He must know where I live.

01:03.839 --> 01:06.719
Do you think he's watching us now?

01:06.720 --> 01:08.438
Do you know what it might mean?

01:08.439 --> 01:12.239
- Shut up about what?
- No idea.

01:14.159 --> 01:16.360
Do you have any sense...

01:17.959 --> 01:20.679
who the message could be from?

01:20.680 --> 01:22.200
No.

01:24.439 --> 01:28.038
Trish, could this text be from
the man that you slept with

01:28.039 --> 01:29.638
on the morning you were attacked?

01:29.639 --> 01:32.158
I told you, I'm not
talking about him.

01:32.159 --> 01:34.399
But he has your mobile number, right?

01:34.400 --> 01:36.919
It's not him.

01:36.920 --> 01:39.799
We are probably gonna retrieve his DNA

01:39.800 --> 01:41.758
from your bedsheets anyway.

01:41.759 --> 01:44.638
It's quicker if you tell us.

01:44.639 --> 01:48.199
Look, I'm sorry I wasn't
good enough in that interview.

01:48.200 --> 01:49.799
It's not about being...

01:49.800 --> 01:51.679
I should be allowed
not to tell you.

01:51.680 --> 01:54.118
It was before the attack.
It's not connected.

01:54.119 --> 01:56.359
- We don't know that for sure.
- I know that for sure!

01:56.360 --> 01:58.600
What if you're wrong?

02:00.200 --> 02:01.559
We know how hard this is.

02:01.560 --> 02:04.038
Yeah, right - you know how it feels

02:04.039 --> 02:06.999
to be tied up,
to have your body violated

02:07.000 --> 02:08.679
and to feel like it's your fault?

02:08.680 --> 02:12.038
Because all I'm thinking every
second of every day right now

02:12.039 --> 02:13.879
is "How did I cause this?"

02:13.920 --> 02:15.519
"What did I do to make this happen?"

02:20.319 --> 02:22.560
I don't know how that feels, no.

02:24.560 --> 02:26.759
We will find the man
who attacked you.

02:28.200 --> 02:31.199
We will find whoever it was
who sent the anonymous message.

02:31.200 --> 02:34.078
But it will take longer
without your full cooperation.

02:34.079 --> 02:37.200
I'm not telling you
who I slept with.

02:52.920 --> 02:55.079
For God's sake, Ian.
Turn it off.

03:05.720 --> 03:08.118
Hi, it's me. Can you talk?

03:08.119 --> 03:12.078
Yeah. Mum's in her room
and the police just left.

03:12.079 --> 03:14.078
Are you sure about this, Leah?

03:14.079 --> 03:16.200
Do you think I'd make it up?

03:18.400 --> 03:20.599
Does she...

03:20.600 --> 03:22.158
Does she know who it was?

03:22.159 --> 03:24.519
<i>I don't think so.</i>

03:27.039 --> 03:31.158
Listen, I'm... I'm not sure what to do.

03:31.159 --> 03:33.559
Do you think I should come round?

03:33.560 --> 03:36.438
You can't. She told me
not to tell you.

03:36.439 --> 03:40.400
<i>Why would someone do this, Dad?</i>

03:45.720 --> 03:48.559
I'll keep her phone in
an unsealed exhibit bag.

03:48.560 --> 03:51.878
If anyone wants access to it,
they'll have to go through me.

03:51.879 --> 03:55.518
And we can get onto finding the
source of the text first thing.

03:55.519 --> 03:58.118
You look dead on your feet.

03:58.119 --> 03:59.839
Thanks a lot.

04:00.920 --> 04:02.599
What do you think, Miller -

04:02.600 --> 04:04.279
do you think
her attacker sent that text?

04:04.280 --> 04:06.599
Well, it doesn't make sense.
Why send it now?

04:06.600 --> 04:08.799
The news has been released.
It's gone public.

04:08.800 --> 04:10.600
Unless the news reports triggered it.

04:11.639 --> 04:13.279
If it was her attacker,

04:13.280 --> 04:16.199
it makes it much more likely
it's someone she knows.

04:16.200 --> 04:19.678
Are you really gonna drink
that disgusting stewed tea?

04:19.680 --> 04:23.079
Shut up about what? Does he
think she knows his identity?

04:24.200 --> 04:25.999
Or is there more she's not telling us?

04:26.000 --> 04:27.838
I've got to go home, got to go to bed.

04:27.839 --> 04:30.199
I suggest you do the same.
We've got an early start.

04:30.200 --> 04:33.518
See, if she knows her attacker,

04:33.519 --> 04:35.280
what's the motive?

04:36.159 --> 04:37.919
Someone angry with her?

04:37.920 --> 04:40.078
Jealous about something?

04:40.079 --> 04:43.359
Wants to punish her?

04:43.360 --> 04:46.200
Or is it just about a drunken
flirt and it turned violent?

04:46.239 --> 04:48.518
With respect, sir,
there was no flirting.

04:48.519 --> 04:50.919
He knocked her out.
It was about power and control.

04:50.920 --> 04:52.758
- Not sex.
- I know that.

04:52.759 --> 04:55.118
And you were too hard on
Trish today at her house.

04:55.119 --> 04:57.118
I know you're tired.
I know you want a result.

04:57.119 --> 04:59.239
But you've got to go easier.

05:01.360 --> 05:03.600
I'm scared he's gonna do it again.

05:05.839 --> 05:07.360
That's why I'm pushing.

05:11.119 --> 05:13.159
I've got to go home.

05:39.959 --> 05:41.560
- Goodnight.
- 'Night!

06:01.280 --> 06:03.600
You could have come to the house.

06:07.200 --> 06:09.280
Trish has been raped.

06:11.400 --> 06:13.519
Yeah, I know.

06:14.959 --> 06:17.118
How can you know?
Leah's only just told me.

06:17.119 --> 06:20.878
The police, they came to see me.

06:20.879 --> 06:22.559
They were after the party invite list.

06:22.560 --> 06:24.919
The police came to see you
and you didn't tell me?

06:24.920 --> 06:26.438
It weren't my place to tell you.

06:26.439 --> 06:28.439
Anyway, I didn't know
if I was allowed.

06:29.639 --> 06:31.999
- Have you seen Trish?
- Hmm!

06:32.000 --> 06:34.838
Not exactly gonna be
high on her list, am I?

06:34.839 --> 06:37.158
Do you know what happened?

06:37.159 --> 06:38.919
I haven't got a clue.

06:38.920 --> 06:41.280
I was hoping you might have.

06:43.439 --> 06:45.478
Well, only what the police said -

06:45.479 --> 06:48.478
that it was at the party
and it was late in the evening.

06:48.479 --> 06:51.079
Christ.

06:59.839 --> 07:01.280
Listen, um...

07:04.200 --> 07:07.839
You know, me and Cath,
we'll be there for Trish.

07:07.879 --> 07:10.238
And for you, mate.

07:10.239 --> 07:13.478
All the problems that
you guys have been having

07:13.479 --> 07:16.039
don't matter now.

07:16.959 --> 07:18.719
What's important is that Trish

07:18.720 --> 07:20.279
gets whatever help she's gonna need

07:20.280 --> 07:22.200
and the police get the bloke who...

07:24.439 --> 07:26.318
who did that to her.

07:26.319 --> 07:28.759
Yeah. Thanks.

07:31.319 --> 07:36.038
Look, I...
I think I might be in the shit.

07:36.039 --> 07:38.238
What do you mean?

07:38.239 --> 07:41.359
The police came to see me at the school

07:41.360 --> 07:43.478
before I knew it was Trish.

07:43.479 --> 07:45.478
Can you believe it?
They didn't tell me.

07:45.479 --> 07:48.399
Jim... promise this won't go any further?

07:48.400 --> 07:50.800
I'm not gonna promise till
I know what you're talking about.

07:53.319 --> 07:55.838
I told the police
what I did at the party -

07:55.839 --> 07:58.758
who I saw, how I got home.

07:58.759 --> 08:01.438
But I made it all up.

08:01.439 --> 08:03.200
You what?

08:06.479 --> 08:09.518
- Ian.
- I blacked out.

08:09.519 --> 08:10.919
Oh, for God's sake.

08:10.920 --> 08:12.518
Well, I'd had a row with Sarah

08:12.519 --> 08:14.518
'cause she hates all of
you and you hate her,

08:14.519 --> 08:17.359
and she'd gone,
and I had a row with Trish.

08:17.360 --> 08:20.038
And then I started
drinking tequila.

08:20.039 --> 08:22.199
You can vouch for me, yeah?

08:22.200 --> 08:24.958
If it comes up, you can
tell them what I'm like

08:24.959 --> 08:26.639
if I drink tequila.

08:28.239 --> 08:30.199
How much do you remember?

08:30.200 --> 08:33.679
Mate, you had a lot
of booze on that night

08:33.679 --> 08:35.279
and it'd been a tough week.

08:35.280 --> 08:39.198
I just remember waking up
on the grass near the lake.

08:39.200 --> 08:41.758
For Christ's sake, Ian.
The police are gonna check.

08:41.759 --> 08:45.280
I know! But what do I do?
I don't remember anything.

08:47.159 --> 08:50.119
My wife was being raped
and I don't know where I was.

09:10.319 --> 09:11.758
Can I help you?

09:11.759 --> 09:13.719
Is Daisy in?

09:13.720 --> 09:15.758
- Who's asking?
- You her dad?

09:15.759 --> 09:17.318
Who are you?

09:17.319 --> 09:20.200
- She'll be at the park.
- She'll be at school.

09:21.800 --> 09:24.878
What's your names? I'll make
sure she knows you stopped by.

09:24.879 --> 09:26.518
Just tell her the boys came round.

09:26.519 --> 09:28.158
"The boys"?

09:28.159 --> 09:32.239
- Alright.
- Thanks, Daisy's dad.

09:51.039 --> 09:52.958
Alright?

09:52.959 --> 09:55.118
What are you doing here?

09:55.119 --> 09:56.999
- Why are you smiling?
- Nice to see you too.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.758
Brought you some water.

09:58.759 --> 10:00.158
- You never take enough water.
- Thanks.

10:00.159 --> 10:03.038
- You around this afternoon?
- Uh, yeah.

10:03.039 --> 10:04.919
What about Chlo?

10:04.920 --> 10:07.478
Yeah, her exam finishes midday. Why?

10:07.479 --> 10:10.758
Alright if I come around?
Like, 1:00 be alright?

10:10.759 --> 10:12.518
What for?

10:12.519 --> 10:15.518
I'll tell you later. Go on,
don't wanna ruin your run.

10:15.519 --> 10:17.600
OK.

10:49.519 --> 10:52.238
<i>Hi, this is Trish and Leah.</i>

10:52.239 --> 10:53.800
<i>Leave us a message.</i>

10:56.400 --> 10:58.560
I heard what happened, Trish.

10:59.639 --> 11:02.479
I had to come here.
I had to see you.

11:04.680 --> 11:06.800
I... I don't know what to say.

11:08.680 --> 11:10.919
I'm so sorry.

11:10.920 --> 11:13.319
God, that sounds so useless.

11:15.560 --> 11:20.360
Listen, look... whatever's
gone on these last few months,

11:20.400 --> 11:24.919
if you need me, I'm here.

11:24.920 --> 11:27.680
I want to be here for you.

11:29.400 --> 11:31.118
I love you, Trish.

11:31.119 --> 11:33.078
Trish Winterman received

11:33.079 --> 11:35.238
an anonymous threatening text message

11:35.239 --> 11:37.078
from a blocked number late last night.

11:37.079 --> 11:39.680
Finding who sent that
message is a priority

11:39.720 --> 11:42.238
to establish A, whether
it's a serious threat,

11:42.239 --> 11:44.078
and B, if it's from the attacker.

11:44.079 --> 11:46.318
If it is, it's the best lead we have.

11:46.319 --> 11:49.599
So, who on our list
of possible suspects

11:49.600 --> 11:51.238
would have access to Trish's number?

11:51.239 --> 11:53.078
Miller has Trish's phone.

11:53.079 --> 11:55.719
We need the contacts and
the message history examining.

11:55.720 --> 11:59.438
Now, Trish's ABE was less
productive than we'd hoped.

11:59.439 --> 12:01.200
She's still very traumatised.

12:01.239 --> 12:02.878
We'll need to conduct
clarifying interviews with her

12:02.879 --> 12:04.559
when she's more recovered.

12:04.560 --> 12:07.878
But she did make us aware
that she had sex with a man,

12:07.879 --> 12:10.078
not her husband,
on the morning of the attack,

12:10.079 --> 12:11.758
though as of now,

12:11.759 --> 12:14.280
she's currently reluctant
to tell us his identity.

12:14.319 --> 12:16.158
- Helpful of her.
- You know what, Harford?

12:16.159 --> 12:18.280
I'm not in the mood for
your noise this morning.

12:22.159 --> 12:23.599
No, sir.

12:23.600 --> 12:26.199
What else from the ABE, Miller?

12:26.200 --> 12:30.799
Um, we know that Trish was
driven to the party in a taxi

12:30.800 --> 12:33.238
by a guy named Lucas of Budmouth Taxis.

12:33.239 --> 12:36.199
He claims his radio was out
of service for the whole night,

12:36.200 --> 12:38.038
but he's got no clear
alibi for his whereabouts

12:38.039 --> 12:39.719
during the time of the attack -

12:39.720 --> 12:42.038
which, by the way,
we're still trying to nail down.

12:42.039 --> 12:43.719
We think between 11pm and 1am.

12:43.720 --> 12:47.318
But Trish is unclear
what time she stepped outside

12:47.319 --> 12:50.038
and how long she was unconscious for.

12:50.039 --> 12:52.078
We are looking further into

12:52.079 --> 12:54.559
the driver's work history
and family details.

12:54.560 --> 12:57.078
Harford, that piece of condom
wrapper found at the scene?

12:57.079 --> 12:59.559
We've identified the brand

12:59.560 --> 13:02.919
and I have a list of local stockists,

13:02.920 --> 13:04.318
including vending machines.

13:04.319 --> 13:05.999
So I'm just working my way round,

13:06.000 --> 13:07.478
trying to find out
any recent purchases,

13:07.479 --> 13:09.478
particularly in the days
before the attack.

13:09.479 --> 13:12.038
Well, sooner the better. Lots to
get through, time's against us.

13:12.039 --> 13:15.478
So far we've interviewed
27 of the guests at the party.

13:15.479 --> 13:17.638
You've all been allocated actions.

13:17.639 --> 13:19.799
I want results on those
by the end of today.

13:19.800 --> 13:21.478
Keep taking DNA swabs.

13:21.479 --> 13:23.999
Make a note of all those
who refuse to give a sample.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.559
Harford, you're in charge
of the summary board.

13:25.560 --> 13:27.318
I want every man's
details and movements

13:27.319 --> 13:28.878
before you knock off tonight.

13:28.879 --> 13:30.599
- Have you got that?
- Yep, sir.

13:30.600 --> 13:32.200
Right. On you go.

13:34.400 --> 13:37.720
- He doesn't like me, does he?
- It's not about you.

13:39.159 --> 13:41.158
He's worried and he's tired.

13:41.159 --> 13:42.878
He doesn't have to bite my head off.

13:42.879 --> 13:45.079
Miller! Come on.

14:15.680 --> 14:17.118
Tom!

14:17.119 --> 14:19.479
Yeah, coming, Grandad!

14:27.000 --> 14:31.919
I... I have to report these two to you.

14:31.920 --> 14:34.158
Thank you very much.

14:34.159 --> 14:37.478
And what are they in for, then?
A lecture on morality?

14:37.479 --> 14:40.318
- Bible teachings?
- No.

14:40.319 --> 14:42.318
A five-minute talk
on why they're idiots,

14:42.319 --> 14:45.078
then two hours labour digging
up weeds in the churchyard.

14:45.079 --> 14:47.279
It's the school's preferred punishment.

14:47.280 --> 14:49.158
Ah, sounds as though
they're not the first.

14:49.159 --> 14:51.438
They are very much not the first.

14:51.439 --> 14:53.518
And how you doing? You alright?

14:53.519 --> 14:55.279
Me? Oh, yeah, yeah.

14:55.280 --> 14:58.078
I'm sleeping in my daughter's box room

14:58.079 --> 15:00.438
while she works herself to death.

15:00.439 --> 15:04.318
Yeah, it's the retirement
I always dreamed of.

15:04.319 --> 15:06.158
You must still be grieving yourself.

15:06.159 --> 15:08.478
Ah, well, I just carry on with it.

15:08.479 --> 15:11.279
I mean, I can't change it, can I?

15:11.280 --> 15:15.038
- If you wanna talk...
- Uh, no, thank you, Vicar.

15:15.039 --> 15:18.999
Not into all that bullshit.
No offence.

15:19.000 --> 15:22.439
Come on, Fred! Playground!
Yeah, come on.

15:26.119 --> 15:28.079
Porn on your phones?

15:29.720 --> 15:31.479
Really?

15:45.400 --> 15:48.919
OK. That's great. Thank you.

15:48.920 --> 15:51.280
What was your fight
with Jim Atwood about?

15:54.239 --> 15:56.038
I wouldn't really call it a fight.

15:56.039 --> 15:57.719
That's how it was described to us.

15:57.720 --> 15:59.878
What, so you think I had a scrap

15:59.879 --> 16:01.758
and then went and raped
Trish Winterman?

16:01.759 --> 16:04.359
What was the fight about?

16:04.360 --> 16:08.038
Jim likes to tell me
when Cath can and can't work.

16:08.039 --> 16:09.679
He was accusing me of deliberately

16:09.680 --> 16:11.958
putting her on shifts
that inconvenience him.

16:11.959 --> 16:14.478
- And you fought over that?
- He winds me up.

16:14.479 --> 16:16.318
He has that crappy little garage -

16:16.319 --> 16:19.078
which, by the way,
is going down the shitter -

16:19.079 --> 16:21.118
but he behaves like he's royalty.

16:21.119 --> 16:23.719
He was having a little dig
and I'd had enough.

16:23.720 --> 16:25.279
So I went over and offered him out

16:25.280 --> 16:27.478
and it all got a bit lairy.

16:27.479 --> 16:29.279
But sometimes you have to draw the line.

16:29.280 --> 16:32.519
And his wife's 50th
was the moment you chose?

16:33.680 --> 16:37.078
I know what he thought -
I couldn't look after myself.

16:37.079 --> 16:38.919
How did the fight end?

16:38.920 --> 16:40.599
It was, like, four punches thrown.

16:40.600 --> 16:42.438
That's what I mean -
it was barely anything.

16:42.439 --> 16:45.118
- And what happened then?
- I went home.

16:45.119 --> 16:47.118
- How did you get home?
- I drove.

16:47.119 --> 16:48.439
You weren't drinking?

16:49.519 --> 16:51.199
I don't drink.

16:51.200 --> 16:53.560
You were sober when you had
a fight with Jim Atwood?

16:53.600 --> 16:54.878
Yes.

16:54.879 --> 16:56.559
Was anyone home
when you got back?

16:56.560 --> 16:58.078
I live on my own.

16:58.079 --> 17:00.199
My wife died 13 years back,
before I came here.

17:00.200 --> 17:02.038
How long has Trish worked here?

17:02.039 --> 17:04.758
Nine years.
Longest-standing staff member.

17:04.759 --> 17:07.038
I'd be lost without her. She's great.

17:07.039 --> 17:09.279
I hope somebody's said to you

17:09.280 --> 17:11.398
that she won't have done
anything to provoke this.

17:11.400 --> 17:13.279
She's not that sort of woman.

17:13.280 --> 17:15.680
What sort of woman is that?

17:17.239 --> 17:19.238
She's not the sort of
woman this happens to.

17:19.239 --> 17:21.200
That's what makes it so awful.

17:31.200 --> 17:33.638
Did you tell them
I had a scrap with Jim?

17:33.639 --> 17:35.438
No!

17:35.439 --> 17:38.038
- Have you heard from Trish?
- No.

17:38.039 --> 17:40.280
I was thinking about going over, but...

17:41.479 --> 17:43.319
God, I don't know.

17:44.280 --> 17:47.999
I feel... ashamed.
You know, responsible.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.838
It was my party, wasn't it?

17:49.839 --> 17:52.119
How am I supposed to
look her in the eye?

17:54.360 --> 17:56.799
What happened to you
after that fight, Ed?

17:56.800 --> 17:59.838
- How do you mean?
- I didn't see you after that.

17:59.839 --> 18:01.199
Don't know anyone who did.

18:01.200 --> 18:03.959
I was around, then I went home.

18:05.439 --> 18:08.400
Come on, let's get back to work.
There's plenty to do.

18:15.720 --> 18:17.158
So that camera was in operation

18:17.159 --> 18:18.999
on the night of the party?

18:19.000 --> 18:22.679
Yes. I've put
all the footage on here.

18:22.680 --> 18:26.118
It'll show whoever came in
or out this way, at least.

18:26.119 --> 18:28.438
And you weren't here
yourself that night?

18:28.439 --> 18:31.559
No, I was at home,
looking after the dogs.

18:31.560 --> 18:34.039
My wife was having dinner with friends.

18:35.519 --> 18:38.038
How's she doing, the lady?

18:38.039 --> 18:40.638
She's being looked after.

18:40.639 --> 18:42.319
I'm devastated for her.

18:43.879 --> 18:46.038
23 years, we've been
holding functions here.

18:46.039 --> 18:48.639
Nothing like this, ever.

18:50.879 --> 18:54.280
When my father was alive,
we'd spend the summers here.

18:55.159 --> 18:57.679
Down by the waterfall,
under the tree,

18:57.680 --> 18:59.518
that was my place.

18:59.519 --> 19:01.959
I'd sit and no-one would notice me.

19:05.159 --> 19:07.559
I don't think we'll
rent it out anymore.

19:07.560 --> 19:09.518
Not after this.

19:09.519 --> 19:12.118
An act like this,
it sullies everything.

19:12.119 --> 19:14.119
It sullies us all.

19:23.680 --> 19:25.878
Felt more difficult today,

19:25.879 --> 19:27.638
leaving the house.

19:27.639 --> 19:29.518
I didn't know if I could.

19:29.519 --> 19:31.999
This won't be a straight line.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.958
Some days will feel harder
than others for no reason.

19:34.959 --> 19:38.238
I keep thinking about
that police interview.

19:38.239 --> 19:40.919
I didn't get it right.

19:40.920 --> 19:43.279
I could see it in their faces.

19:43.280 --> 19:46.079
Your only responsibility
is to tell the truth.

19:48.639 --> 19:50.679
Have you spoken to anyone
else about the attack

19:50.680 --> 19:52.599
other than Leah?

19:52.600 --> 19:54.799
- No.
- Do you want to?

19:54.800 --> 19:56.838
No.

19:56.839 --> 20:00.118
Cath must know by now.
The police must have told her.

20:00.119 --> 20:03.118
She keeps sending me messages,
I keep not replying.

20:03.119 --> 20:05.118
Would it be helpful to talk to her?

20:05.119 --> 20:06.599
She's a close friend, isn't she?

20:06.600 --> 20:10.759
Yeah, but... you know, it was her party.

20:12.079 --> 20:14.560
They'd been organising
it for so long and...

20:15.959 --> 20:18.118
And now, now she'll always remember it

20:18.119 --> 20:20.238
as the time when... this happened.

20:20.239 --> 20:21.800
Trish, that's not your responsibility.

20:21.839 --> 20:23.519
You can't think like that.

20:25.759 --> 20:28.720
We blame ourselves when bad
things happen and we shouldn't.

20:34.920 --> 20:36.720
I know who you are, Beth.

20:38.239 --> 20:40.800
I googled you. I'm sorry.

20:42.600 --> 20:44.318
Right.

20:44.319 --> 20:48.238
That boy who was killed a few
years back. That was your son.

20:48.239 --> 20:50.118
You're Danny's mum.

20:50.119 --> 20:52.119
Yeah, I am.

20:53.639 --> 20:56.999
I am so sorry for what happened to you.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.438
Thank you.

20:59.439 --> 21:01.239
I don't know how you've coped.

21:01.280 --> 21:04.159
Plenty of days I haven't.

21:06.039 --> 21:07.799
I promised myself...

21:07.800 --> 21:10.560
I promised Danny that
I wouldn't give in.

21:14.439 --> 21:16.239
Nothing makes it better.

21:17.479 --> 21:20.758
I'm not gonna lie, Trish.
This is gonna be hard for you.

21:20.759 --> 21:23.599
You're gonna feel so alone.

21:23.600 --> 21:27.318
But you need your family and
you're gonna need your friends.

21:27.319 --> 21:30.719
You can't let them win.

21:30.720 --> 21:32.400
We will not let them win.

21:38.680 --> 21:40.759
That wasn't so bad.

21:42.959 --> 21:44.559
You OK?

21:44.560 --> 21:46.518
Yeah.

21:46.519 --> 21:49.559
It's just 'cause, you know,
you don't say much.

21:49.560 --> 21:51.719
Just stuff at home.

21:51.720 --> 21:53.158
My stepdad's being a dick.

21:53.159 --> 21:54.839
More of a dick than normal.

21:55.920 --> 21:58.238
Oh! In fact...

21:58.239 --> 22:00.199
I thought your mum took it off you.

22:00.200 --> 22:02.799
Well, yeah, but I took it back.

22:02.800 --> 22:05.199
Everything's still on here.

22:05.200 --> 22:06.878
Mate, I'm really not that bothered.

22:06.879 --> 22:09.400
You haven't seen it. I have.

22:29.439 --> 22:31.838
Oh, it's good, this place.
We can have some lunch after.

22:31.839 --> 22:33.518
It's not a jolly, Miller.

22:33.519 --> 22:35.919
We've got this guy and then the
musician. We're behind already.

22:35.920 --> 22:38.518
What, do you live on air?
You never eat!

22:38.519 --> 22:41.118
No wonder you're so grouchy. And thin.

22:41.119 --> 22:43.638
- Thin and grouchy.
- Hi.

22:43.639 --> 22:45.199
So you did the catering

22:45.200 --> 22:46.999
for Cath Atwood's party
on Saturday night?

22:47.000 --> 22:48.679
Yeah, it was our first big outside do.

22:48.680 --> 22:50.118
Cath comes in here a lot.

22:50.119 --> 22:51.638
She asked if we fancied doing the food.

22:51.639 --> 22:53.878
And how many people
did you take with you?

22:53.879 --> 22:56.559
Uh, me and Sami prepared the food,

22:56.560 --> 22:59.038
then we had four of our staff
take the finger food around.

22:59.039 --> 23:00.559
We cooked it all here during the day,

23:00.560 --> 23:02.279
then shipped it over to Axehampton.

23:02.280 --> 23:04.758
Got there around 4:00,
started setting up.

23:04.759 --> 23:06.399
There was a lot of food.

23:06.400 --> 23:08.318
And did you see anything
unusual that night?

23:08.319 --> 23:11.318
Anything out of the ordinary -
any arguments or conflicts?

23:11.319 --> 23:15.038
We did the food, cleared up,
came home, knackered.

23:15.039 --> 23:17.078
Had one fag break all night.

23:17.079 --> 23:19.359
10-minute wander in the garden.
That was it.

23:19.360 --> 23:21.799
What time was the fag break?

23:21.800 --> 23:24.758
Late. Uh, half eleven, twelve.

23:24.759 --> 23:27.038
Where did you walk?

23:27.039 --> 23:29.478
Down to the lake and back.

23:29.479 --> 23:32.158
Did you see anyone else down there?

23:32.159 --> 23:34.279
No.

23:34.280 --> 23:37.199
We'll need the names and
details of all your team.

23:37.200 --> 23:39.438
- No problem.
- Just one more thing.

23:39.439 --> 23:43.399
Would you mind if we took a DNA swab?

23:43.400 --> 23:45.638
We're taking them from everyone
who was there on Saturday night.

23:45.639 --> 23:48.839
We'll need to do the same with
your staff. It is voluntary.

23:50.119 --> 23:52.119
If that's what you need.

23:53.560 --> 23:56.399
You guys want anything to
eat while you're here?

23:56.400 --> 23:58.639
Oh, no, we're fine.
We need to get on.

24:04.800 --> 24:07.399
Can you have her Friday morning?
I've got a client appointment.

24:07.400 --> 24:10.279
- Yeah, no prob.
- That was easy.

24:10.280 --> 24:12.319
I am easy!

24:14.000 --> 24:16.238
Aren't I, sweetheart?
Easy old Dad.

24:16.239 --> 24:18.279
I'll get it.

24:18.280 --> 24:22.318
- What's he up to?
- Don't be so suspicious.

24:22.319 --> 24:24.600
Thanks for coming.
Come on through.

24:26.680 --> 24:29.279
- Ben.
- Beth. Chloe.

24:29.280 --> 24:30.919
Good to see you looking so well.

24:30.920 --> 24:33.318
I haven't seen you since court.
How are you getting along?

24:33.319 --> 24:35.238
I'm sorry - why are you here?

24:35.239 --> 24:36.999
Sorry - you didn't know I was coming?

24:37.000 --> 24:39.478
- No, we didn't.
- Ah.

24:39.479 --> 24:42.158
I've been thinking about
next steps in terms of Danny.

24:42.159 --> 24:44.038
- No, Mark. Come on.
- Just listen.

24:44.039 --> 24:45.838
- This is not fair.
- 10 minutes, that's all.

24:45.839 --> 24:48.038
If it's easier, I can come back.

24:48.039 --> 24:50.158
I'm really sorry, Ben.
This is so embarrassing.

24:50.159 --> 24:51.838
- Honestly, no. I can go.
- You stay.

24:51.839 --> 24:53.238
Just stay, alright?

24:53.239 --> 24:54.799
We know that there's no chance

24:54.800 --> 24:56.279
of a retrial for Joe Miller, correct?

24:56.280 --> 24:57.878
Not unless any compelling

24:57.879 --> 24:59.359
new evidence comes to light.

24:59.360 --> 25:01.438
Are you really gonna
make us talk about this?

25:01.439 --> 25:03.919
We have never talked about
a private prosecution.

25:03.920 --> 25:06.158
God, Mark! Stop doing this to us!

25:06.159 --> 25:07.999
The answer is no!

25:08.000 --> 25:09.719
At least let's just talk about it!

25:09.720 --> 25:12.478
You say 'private prosecution' -
that's not open to you.

25:12.479 --> 25:15.159
The case went all the way to
a jury and he was acquitted.

25:15.200 --> 25:17.878
Well, what can we do, then?
I've read about these cases.

25:17.879 --> 25:20.318
Sometimes they go for years,
but people don't give up.

25:20.319 --> 25:22.318
If what you're essentially trying to do

25:22.319 --> 25:24.318
is hold Mr Miller to account
for Danny's death...

25:24.319 --> 25:26.359
That is exactly what I'm doing.

25:26.360 --> 25:29.758
Then you can pursue a civil case
against him. It's complex.

25:29.759 --> 25:32.118
Um, it is possible.

25:32.119 --> 25:33.518
I will warn you, though -

25:33.519 --> 25:35.399
these things take
a long time to put together.

25:35.400 --> 25:37.399
- We're not going anywhere.
- Mark!

25:37.400 --> 25:39.719
What?!

25:39.720 --> 25:42.078
Oh, you're busy, are you?
You've got better things to do?

25:42.079 --> 25:43.518
Can we just talk about this

25:43.519 --> 25:45.199
among ourselves first, as a family?

25:45.200 --> 25:47.639
What do you think
I'm doing this for, Chlo?!

25:48.560 --> 25:51.118
I'm doing this for us as a family!

25:51.119 --> 25:53.438
Are you? 'Cause we don't
want it, me and Mum.

25:53.439 --> 25:55.078
We're right here,
we're telling you that,

25:55.079 --> 25:56.639
and you don't seem to hear us.

25:58.039 --> 26:01.919
Also, um, to process a civil suit,

26:01.920 --> 26:03.599
you would need to know
Mr Miller's whereabouts.

26:03.600 --> 26:06.158
- We'd need an address for him.
- He moved.

26:06.159 --> 26:08.359
We heard he changed his name.

26:08.360 --> 26:10.719
And no-one knows where he is anymore.

26:10.720 --> 26:13.518
Well, this is very difficult.

26:13.519 --> 26:15.400
It's almost impossible.

26:16.879 --> 26:18.600
Right. Well, there it is, then.

26:27.560 --> 26:30.758
Never been asked for a DNA
swab before. That's quite cool.

26:30.759 --> 26:32.158
How'd you get the booking?

26:32.159 --> 26:33.999
We play the local pubs.

26:34.000 --> 26:35.878
Jim asked us after
we played at the Anglers.

26:35.879 --> 26:37.559
Said he'd seen us a few times,

26:37.560 --> 26:40.119
would we do a special
set list for his wife?

26:41.519 --> 26:44.600
Here's our card. It's got
our website on the back.

26:45.720 --> 26:47.399
- You any good?
- Yeah.

26:47.400 --> 26:49.758
- Why, do you wanna book us?
- No.

26:49.759 --> 26:52.878
So, what time did you get there
to set up at Axehampton House?

26:52.879 --> 26:56.078
About 5:00. Well, I was there at 5:00.

26:56.079 --> 26:57.999
The other two turned up
about quarter past

26:58.000 --> 27:00.199
and Beefy wanders in gone half six.

27:00.200 --> 27:03.038
Who else was about
when you were setting up?

27:03.039 --> 27:06.438
Caterers. Cath and Jim.
They were arguing.

27:06.439 --> 27:08.518
Few bar staff. That was about it.

27:08.519 --> 27:10.679
What were Cath and Jim arguing about?

27:10.680 --> 27:12.158
Party stuff.

27:12.159 --> 27:13.719
Not enough drink, too much food.

27:13.720 --> 27:15.118
She said she didn't want live music

27:15.119 --> 27:17.158
but he'd booked us anyway.

27:17.159 --> 27:19.438
She was fine in the end.
I saw her up, dancing.

27:19.439 --> 27:21.878
And what did you do straight
after your set finished?

27:21.879 --> 27:24.038
Cheeky drink, packed up, went home.

27:24.039 --> 27:26.478
Didn't see anything
out of the ordinary?

27:26.479 --> 27:29.958
That bloke from the farm shop.
He was in a right old mood.

27:29.959 --> 27:32.239
He looked like he
wanted to kill someone.

27:35.360 --> 27:37.958
Saw him heading off into the gardens.

27:37.959 --> 27:41.239
- What time was this?
- Half eleven-ish.

27:45.879 --> 27:48.078
Oh, seriously, though. Please eat.

27:48.079 --> 27:50.679
- I'm not hungry.
- That's why you're so tired.

27:50.680 --> 27:52.518
- I'm not tired.
- Well, you look terrible.

27:52.519 --> 27:55.400
Just leave me alone,
eat your stupid Scotch egg.

28:00.239 --> 28:02.199
Why did you come back here?

28:02.200 --> 28:05.038
Oh, for God's
sake, not this again.

28:05.039 --> 28:07.438
No, don't do that every time I ask you.

28:07.439 --> 28:09.158
Seriously, though, two years,
I don't hear anything.

28:09.159 --> 28:10.799
No texts or emails or calls.

28:10.800 --> 28:12.438
- I lost my phone.
- No, you didn't.

28:12.439 --> 28:14.720
- It had all your details in it.
- Bollocks did it.

28:18.479 --> 28:20.838
I'm not good at that sort of stuff.

28:20.839 --> 28:23.319
What, people? Human relationships?

28:25.479 --> 28:28.158
I thought I'd go back home,
try and fix the family,

28:28.159 --> 28:30.400
give it another go -
it didn't work out so well.

28:34.159 --> 28:37.519
The place I thought
was home wasn't anymore.

28:40.879 --> 28:42.400
And then Daisy...

28:44.680 --> 28:47.919
She got herself into trouble.
She was at war with her mum.

28:47.920 --> 28:49.638
Well, we both were.

28:49.639 --> 28:51.159
I just thought maybe here...

28:52.600 --> 28:54.038
she'd have another chance.

28:54.039 --> 28:55.800
Like I had.

28:57.119 --> 28:58.799
Thought you hated it here.

28:58.800 --> 29:00.720
I do. Mostly.

29:02.839 --> 29:04.959
It's not about me.

29:07.479 --> 29:09.878
There's not many dads would have
done that for their daughter.

29:09.879 --> 29:12.239
Wouldn't they?

29:14.759 --> 29:17.039
It's really got under your skin,
this case, hasn't it?

29:20.879 --> 29:22.878
I just... I can't...

29:22.879 --> 29:24.999
understand the psychology

29:25.000 --> 29:27.038
of the man who does this sort of thing.

29:27.039 --> 29:28.438
You don't have to understand him.

29:28.439 --> 29:30.399
We just have to nail the bastard.

29:30.400 --> 29:33.078
You know what's bothering me?

29:33.079 --> 29:35.319
It's not narrowing down.

29:35.360 --> 29:37.719
Normally, we'd have been able
to rule some of these men out.

29:37.720 --> 29:40.438
It feels like the more
we talk to, the more we rule in.

29:40.439 --> 29:42.919
They were all there,
they all saw Trish,

29:42.920 --> 29:44.799
they all had an opportunity.

29:44.800 --> 29:47.799
It's a scarily wide net right now.

29:47.800 --> 29:50.438
Oh, hold that.

29:50.439 --> 29:53.478
What? No! Come on!

29:53.479 --> 29:55.479
Hello? Yep?

29:58.280 --> 30:00.279
It's the woman from the cab company.

30:00.280 --> 30:02.280
Oh, right?

30:03.560 --> 30:04.999
Hi again!

30:05.000 --> 30:06.719
Can we borrow you at the station?

30:06.720 --> 30:08.399
I'm on shift.

30:08.400 --> 30:11.039
We've cleared it with your controller.

30:11.920 --> 30:13.478
You like to be known as Lucas

30:13.479 --> 30:16.399
but your first name is actually Clive?

30:16.400 --> 30:18.318
Yeah.

30:18.319 --> 30:20.400
I don't think that's illegal, is it?

30:22.200 --> 30:24.038
When we spoke, you said that

30:24.039 --> 30:25.878
your radio was broken
on Saturday night.

30:25.879 --> 30:27.038
Yep.

30:27.039 --> 30:28.719
And Trish Winterman,

30:28.720 --> 30:30.878
who'd booked a return journey
with you, didn't turn up.

30:30.879 --> 30:32.638
- Correct.
- You called her mobile.

30:32.639 --> 30:34.199
- No reply.
- That's right.

30:34.200 --> 30:37.360
- Did you go looking for her?
- No.

30:41.159 --> 30:44.438
You stayed in the car park
at Axehampton with your light on

30:44.439 --> 30:46.958
and you ferried people back and
forth - that's what you told us.

30:46.959 --> 30:49.038
That's what I did.

30:49.039 --> 30:50.438
And were any of those people

30:50.439 --> 30:53.599
customers like Trish who'd pre-booked?

30:53.600 --> 30:56.638
- Some.
- How many?

30:56.639 --> 30:58.638
Hard to say.

30:58.639 --> 31:01.919
Um, I've got a list from your
controller of the pre-bookings.

31:01.920 --> 31:03.318
Right.

31:03.319 --> 31:04.999
If you could have a look through

31:05.000 --> 31:06.638
and tell us which ones you took.

31:06.639 --> 31:09.878
For the tape,
DS Miller is showing Mr Lucas

31:09.879 --> 31:12.319
form EM43.

31:14.879 --> 31:16.758
It's difficult, you know?

31:16.759 --> 31:19.958
I don't know people's names,
just their faces.

31:19.959 --> 31:21.758
Do your best.

31:21.759 --> 31:23.239
OK.

31:24.560 --> 31:26.518
Uh...

31:26.519 --> 31:28.800
Tony Bird. Took him.

31:28.839 --> 31:31.238
The Symes. Took them.

31:31.239 --> 31:34.758
And Sam and Sophie Potter.

31:34.759 --> 31:37.239
That's probably it.

31:41.920 --> 31:44.238
Why are you lying to us, Lucas?

31:44.239 --> 31:46.279
Sorry?

31:46.280 --> 31:48.999
We called all these people.
You didn't take any of them.

31:49.000 --> 31:51.560
Did you not think we'd check?

31:53.400 --> 31:55.758
Why would you lie about
what you were doing

31:55.759 --> 31:57.800
on the night a woman was raped?

32:02.920 --> 32:05.958
Look, it's daft, but...

32:05.959 --> 32:08.518
I picked a fare up off the road.

32:08.519 --> 32:11.078
- What?
- I know we're not supposed to, legally.

32:11.079 --> 32:13.238
I thought you were gonna
have a go at me.

32:13.239 --> 32:17.359
But they flagged me down
and it was a good fare. 40 quid.

32:17.360 --> 32:21.720
And I never told Ange at the
office. Just took the cash.

32:23.720 --> 32:25.878
What time was this?

32:25.879 --> 32:27.759
Half nine, ten.

32:27.800 --> 32:31.199
I dropped off this woman, Sarah,
who'd left the party early.

32:31.200 --> 32:32.799
I was heading back to Axehampton,

32:32.800 --> 32:34.438
turned off the Dorchester road

32:34.439 --> 32:36.359
and that's where he flagged me down.

32:36.360 --> 32:39.638
- How old was this man?
- 30... ish.

32:39.639 --> 32:41.279
Which direction was he walking?

32:41.280 --> 32:43.318
Away from Axehampton, towards
the turning onto the A35.

32:43.319 --> 32:46.279
What sort of mood was he in
when he got in the cab?

32:46.280 --> 32:48.758
- Grateful.
- What address did you take him to?

32:48.759 --> 32:51.038
Top of the hill in Lyme.

32:51.039 --> 32:52.878
One of the streets on the right.
He directed me.

32:52.879 --> 32:55.638
You'd be able to take us
to that street if we asked?

32:55.639 --> 32:57.319
Pretty close.

33:00.439 --> 33:02.280
Who's Maria Brady?

33:06.159 --> 33:08.359
Did Angela tell you about that?

33:08.360 --> 33:10.999
What's that got to do with anything?

33:11.000 --> 33:12.600
Answer the question.

33:14.879 --> 33:17.239
Maria was a regular passenger.

33:19.000 --> 33:20.759
She made a complaint about me.

33:23.680 --> 33:25.118
I misread some signals.

33:25.119 --> 33:27.118
What sort of signals?

33:27.119 --> 33:29.758
She liked to tell me about her life.

33:29.759 --> 33:34.679
I did a couple of airport runs.
She'd bring flasks, bit of food.

33:34.680 --> 33:36.680
We got on.

33:38.400 --> 33:40.158
One drop-off,

33:40.159 --> 33:42.479
it was late, and...

33:44.000 --> 33:46.838
I just asked her if
she was gonna invite me in.

33:46.839 --> 33:50.560
And she got really scared.

33:51.639 --> 33:53.559
It was the wrong thing to do.

33:53.560 --> 33:55.518
I knew that straightaway.

33:55.519 --> 33:57.800
Are you married, Lucas?

34:00.920 --> 34:02.479
Yeah.

34:05.239 --> 34:08.679
Trish told us that you two
had been out for a drink.

34:08.679 --> 34:10.679
A date.

34:11.800 --> 34:14.079
You said you only knew her through work.

34:15.360 --> 34:17.518
- It was once.
- Why only once?

34:17.518 --> 34:19.038
We didn't click.

34:19.039 --> 34:20.639
She's older, you know?

34:21.879 --> 34:25.237
At no point after you dropped
her off on Saturday night

34:25.239 --> 34:27.478
did you see Trish Winterman again?

34:27.478 --> 34:29.518
Correct.

34:29.518 --> 34:31.560
You sure about that?

34:33.719 --> 34:35.280
Yeah.

34:53.239 --> 34:54.918
Suppose this is where you tell me off

34:54.920 --> 34:56.878
for bringing him down, is it?

34:56.879 --> 34:58.799
What was that all about today?

34:58.800 --> 35:02.999
How many ways do I have to
say it before you hear me?

35:03.000 --> 35:06.758
- I mean, when's it gonna end?
- Justice for Dan.

35:06.759 --> 35:09.999
That's gone. That went the day
that jury acquitted Joe Miller.

35:10.000 --> 35:11.559
I'm not gonna accept that.

35:11.560 --> 35:13.238
That's what I mean.

35:13.239 --> 35:15.118
No, no. "Who we are is what we do."

35:15.119 --> 35:17.158
That's what you said to me
years back, right?

35:17.159 --> 35:18.799
Now, I am Danny's dad.

35:18.800 --> 35:21.600
And I'm not gonna rest until
I know I've done right by him.

35:21.639 --> 35:24.638
- That's not on you.
- Of course it's on me, Beth.

35:24.639 --> 35:28.360
I weren't there for him.
I should have been there for him.

35:29.560 --> 35:31.518
You scare me, Mark.

35:31.519 --> 35:33.758
I don't know how to reach you anymore.

35:33.759 --> 35:36.719
It's like there's just
you and what you want

35:36.720 --> 35:38.199
and no-one else gets a look-in.

35:38.200 --> 35:40.359
- That's not true.
- Yeah, it is.

35:40.360 --> 35:42.119
Our son died.

35:42.159 --> 35:45.919
All his potential,
everything he could have been,

35:45.920 --> 35:47.559
gone.

35:47.560 --> 35:50.199
But you still have a family.
You have two daughters.

35:50.200 --> 35:52.438
We're still here, we're still living.

35:52.439 --> 35:56.318
And you are wasting what you
have and it makes me so angry.

35:56.319 --> 35:58.599
- I have to make things right.
- For who?

35:58.600 --> 36:01.679
Not for me, and do not say Dan,
because he would not want this.

36:01.680 --> 36:03.959
How do you know?

36:09.319 --> 36:11.360
I still dream of Dan. Do you?

36:13.600 --> 36:15.119
No.

36:19.560 --> 36:21.838
- How was the cab driver?
- You mean Clive?

36:21.839 --> 36:23.518
Shifty.

36:23.519 --> 36:26.199
I've just been speaking on
the phone with Alan Tomkins,

36:26.200 --> 36:28.038
one of the guests at the party.

36:28.039 --> 36:29.878
He used to drive for Budmouth Taxis.

36:29.879 --> 36:31.599
He knows Lucas, he knows the cars.

36:31.600 --> 36:34.199
He said that he saw Lucas's car empty,

36:34.200 --> 36:36.158
locked up, lights out,

36:36.159 --> 36:39.078
in the car park at midnight,
couldn't see Lucas anywhere.

36:39.079 --> 36:41.879
That man is telling us a lot of lies.

36:43.479 --> 36:45.119
Shit. Trish's phone.

36:48.200 --> 36:50.999
New text. Number blocked again.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.560
"I'm sorry."
What does that mean?

37:01.079 --> 37:04.599
Lindsay? DS Miller, DI Hardy.
Wessex Police.

37:04.600 --> 37:07.158
Could you spare us two minutes?
It's about your husband.

37:07.159 --> 37:10.919
He came in to make
a voluntary witness statement

37:10.920 --> 37:12.919
in relation to an investigation today

37:12.920 --> 37:14.478
and we just wanted to

37:14.479 --> 37:16.079
corroborate a few details, if that's OK.

37:16.119 --> 37:17.719
So, how long have you been married?

37:17.720 --> 37:19.118
16 years.

37:19.119 --> 37:20.958
Wow, you got married young, then!

37:20.959 --> 37:24.279
Yeah, 19. We fell in love at university.

37:24.280 --> 37:26.199
He was gonna be a doctor.

37:26.200 --> 37:28.559
Right! Is that what
he was training for?

37:28.560 --> 37:30.599
It was his dream. Still is.

37:30.600 --> 37:33.199
- What stopped him?
- I did.

37:33.200 --> 37:37.638
We were seeing each other.
Young love, really besotted.

37:37.639 --> 37:40.919
Then I found out I was pregnant
from a bloke I had a thing with

37:40.920 --> 37:42.438
just before me and Clive got together.

37:42.439 --> 37:44.518
But Clive, he said, "If that bloke"

37:44.519 --> 37:46.799
"won't do the honourable thing, I will."

37:46.800 --> 37:48.878
Wow, that's quite a thing.

37:48.879 --> 37:52.118
Yeah, he was amazing. Took a
study break to earn some money.

37:52.119 --> 37:54.399
Said he'd get back to it one day.

37:54.400 --> 37:57.280
Hasn't happened like he hoped.

37:59.400 --> 38:03.158
Um, what time did he get
in on Saturday night?

38:03.159 --> 38:05.319
More like Sunday morning. Past 1:00.

38:06.400 --> 38:09.600
He sleeps on that. I have the bed.

38:12.119 --> 38:15.078
Oh, that must be difficult
when he's on late shifts.

38:15.079 --> 38:16.919
Not just when he's on late shifts.

38:16.920 --> 38:18.518
He sleeps there all the time.

38:18.519 --> 38:20.478
Why is that?

38:20.479 --> 38:22.799
He cheats.

38:22.800 --> 38:25.438
10 years now he's been cheating.

38:25.439 --> 38:27.719
He thinks he's a
good liar, but he's not.

38:27.720 --> 38:30.919
It's easy to find out.
And they never last long.

38:30.920 --> 38:33.438
- Does he know that you know?
- Oh, yeah.

38:33.439 --> 38:37.638
Every time, he apologises.
Every time, it's the last time.

38:37.639 --> 38:39.639
Every time, nothing changes.

38:42.680 --> 38:44.599
If you don't mind me asking,

38:44.600 --> 38:46.238
why stay together?

38:46.239 --> 38:50.158
He looked after me
when I made a mistake.

38:50.159 --> 38:53.638
And we made a vow.
To me, a vow means something.

38:53.639 --> 38:55.958
We made our promises in the eyes of God.

38:55.959 --> 39:00.000
He wants to break them, that's
his mistake. I keep my vows.

39:02.879 --> 39:05.038
I can bring up my child.

39:05.039 --> 39:06.759
I pour all my love into him.

39:08.039 --> 39:10.000
I don't need much else.

39:14.000 --> 39:16.679
You know what's bothering
me about this case?

39:16.680 --> 39:19.079
It makes me ashamed to be a man.

39:52.319 --> 39:54.319
Oh, mate.

39:56.400 --> 39:58.999
I thought when it was happening

39:59.000 --> 40:01.838
that he was gonna kill me.

40:01.839 --> 40:03.638
I just assumed, you know?

40:03.639 --> 40:07.919
I thought, "He'll finish with me
and then he'll kill me."

40:07.920 --> 40:09.559
Jesus.

40:09.560 --> 40:12.400
And you've got no idea
who it was? No clue at all?

40:14.200 --> 40:16.360
How many men were at your party?

40:17.600 --> 40:19.279
Too many.

40:19.280 --> 40:21.519
How many do you think would be capable?

40:23.159 --> 40:25.159
Well, after a few drinks?

40:26.519 --> 40:30.039
The police keep asking me could
it have been someone I know?

40:31.039 --> 40:34.438
At first I thought,
"No, not the men I know."

40:34.439 --> 40:35.759
"Not like that."

40:37.119 --> 40:40.799
But now I'm thinking, "Could it?"

40:40.800 --> 40:42.720
I'm not so sure.

40:45.720 --> 40:48.719
Every man at that party
was one of your mates.

40:48.720 --> 40:50.399
I know, I know.

40:50.400 --> 40:53.318
I don't understand. It just
doesn't make sense, any of it.

40:53.319 --> 40:55.800
At a party like that.

41:00.439 --> 41:02.256
Results are back from
the samples of Trish's hair

41:02.280 --> 41:04.078
they took at the SARC.

41:04.079 --> 41:06.679
They've identified
a DNA that's not hers.

41:06.680 --> 41:08.799
There's no match to anyone
on the database yet.

41:08.800 --> 41:11.118
But that's good. At least we've
got something to work from.

41:11.119 --> 41:13.439
Do you wanna come see this, then?

41:19.079 --> 41:20.759
Every man who was at that party.

41:39.639 --> 41:41.879
Right. Pasta.

41:41.920 --> 41:43.759
Again.

41:50.239 --> 41:51.759
What's up with you?

41:53.280 --> 41:56.119
Promise me you had nothing to do
with what happened to Trish.

41:58.839 --> 42:00.319
Are you seriously asking me that?

42:01.839 --> 42:03.439
You wanna ease off on the red, love.

42:06.280 --> 42:08.158
If you've heard anything,

42:08.159 --> 42:09.878
or if you suspect any of your mates...

42:09.879 --> 42:11.438
Why has it gotta be my mates?

42:11.439 --> 42:13.438
Well, because they were
there, weren't they?

42:13.439 --> 42:15.280
They're our friends.
It's gotta be one of them.

42:15.319 --> 42:17.238
What, and you think
they told me about it?

42:17.239 --> 42:20.359
Cooked it up, ran it by me
and I gave it the OK?

42:20.360 --> 42:23.319
Haven't answered the
question, though, have you?

42:28.759 --> 42:30.360
What are you really asking me?

42:33.200 --> 42:35.400
Did I rape one of our best friends?

42:37.280 --> 42:39.238
I need to answer that, do I?

42:39.239 --> 42:41.800
Yeah.

42:50.159 --> 42:51.639
No.

43:14.119 --> 43:16.919
Why are we meeting here?

43:16.920 --> 43:20.078
That stuff you did to the laptop
I gave you - can you delete it?

43:20.079 --> 43:22.199
Have you got the machine?

43:22.200 --> 43:24.719
No, I thought...
you could do it remotely.

43:24.720 --> 43:26.638
No.

43:26.639 --> 43:28.360
That's not how it works.

43:31.319 --> 43:34.159
I don't want anyone to find it.

43:36.200 --> 43:39.519
Get me the computer,
I'll get it removed.

44:05.639 --> 44:07.360
Alright, son?

44:15.680 --> 44:17.519
Yeah, alright, then.

44:20.039 --> 44:21.438
- I'll go.
- No.

44:21.439 --> 44:23.360
- Mum, you don't need to.
- I said no.
