WEBVTT

02:28.815 --> 02:30.984
Is that my wife?

02:31.067 --> 02:33.361
Get off me! Get off!

02:34.154 --> 02:35.905
-Daddy!
-Oh my God.

02:35.989 --> 02:37.782
Olive, where's Eden?

02:37.866 --> 02:41.077
She took her! Angelina… She took her.

02:41.661 --> 02:44.038
She killed Mom, and she took Eden.

02:44.122 --> 02:46.749
Neighbor reported a woman,
20s, auburn hair,

02:46.833 --> 02:48.918
leaving the scene with an infant female.

03:03.933 --> 03:04.767
Hey, Ben.

03:04.851 --> 03:07.187
<i>We need another Amber Alert</i>
<i>and a press conference.</i>

03:07.687 --> 03:09.564
Ben, we ran those alerts
for over a year now.

03:09.647 --> 03:11.733
Well, we need more.
I'm on message boards, Jared.

03:11.816 --> 03:14.152
There are missing kids
found five, ten years later.

03:14.235 --> 03:15.445
Yo, Vasquez!

03:16.070 --> 03:16.905
Let's roll.

03:18.448 --> 03:19.532
Where are you?

03:19.616 --> 03:20.783
I don't know.

03:20.867 --> 03:22.660
Uh, somewhere in Rockland.

03:22.744 --> 03:24.704
<i>All right,</i>
<i>I need to talk to you in person.</i>

03:24.787 --> 03:25.747
Fine. Where?

03:26.331 --> 03:27.248
Go home.

04:07.956 --> 04:09.249
More cherry blossoms?

04:10.458 --> 04:11.417
Yeah.

04:12.710 --> 04:14.003
Same as last night.

04:14.754 --> 04:17.173
I don't know what they mean,
but I intend to find out.

04:28.726 --> 04:29.811
Breakfast!

04:30.520 --> 04:32.855
Hey, it's Gabriel. Again.

04:33.439 --> 04:35.858
Just calling to check in to see
when you might be heading back.

04:36.359 --> 04:37.527
Call me.

04:38.653 --> 04:43.449
You know, I think it's really weird
how you call yourself Gabriel with Dad.

04:43.533 --> 04:45.660
It's his idea.
He thinks the phones are bugged.

04:49.080 --> 04:52.125
-It's still off, isn't it?
-Sorry.

04:52.208 --> 04:55.003
I'm following her recipe
down to the teaspoon.

04:55.086 --> 04:57.297
-Ooh.
-Ooh. Grace's world-famous pancakes?

04:59.841 --> 05:01.926
Hmm. Not exactly. Sorry.

05:02.010 --> 05:04.137
You remember
to let the batter rest?

05:04.220 --> 05:06.639
-Uh, it's how you get your fluff.
-Ew, show-off.

05:07.348 --> 05:09.809
Okay, I have a double shift, so let's go.

05:09.892 --> 05:13.438
-Let's roll. Bills won't pay themselves.
-Thanks, Mom and Dad.

05:13.521 --> 05:14.647
That's not creepy.

05:15.273 --> 05:16.899
No need to thank us.

05:16.983 --> 05:18.234
Until the rules lighten up,

05:18.318 --> 05:20.486
the muggles are happy to work
while the 828ers--

05:20.570 --> 05:22.739
-Sit on their asses.
-Hardly.

05:22.822 --> 05:24.782
You're already doing
the most important job.

05:24.866 --> 05:28.077
Well, speaking of jobs,
I can always get one with my fake ID.

05:28.161 --> 05:29.871
And the more exposure you have out there,

05:29.954 --> 05:32.248
the greater the risk
of people finding out who you are.

05:32.332 --> 05:33.499
Yeah.

05:33.583 --> 05:34.417
Ready?

05:36.627 --> 05:39.339
Oh, uh, actually, just wondering.

05:39.422 --> 05:42.050
-Like, how late can we stay up?
-Bye!

05:42.133 --> 05:44.719
Do we have to take a bath? Do we need one?

05:49.640 --> 05:50.600
You okay?

05:52.268 --> 05:55.021
Look, Cal, you're one of the lucky ones.
You get to fly under the radar

05:55.104 --> 05:58.733
while the rest of us get our entire lives
picked apart by the Registry.

05:58.816 --> 06:00.068
I don't feel so lucky.

06:01.152 --> 06:02.278
You heard from him?

06:03.446 --> 06:06.324
I mean, it's not like I get anything
from him when he is around. It's…

06:07.533 --> 06:09.410
I know he doesn't like
when we go up to his room,

06:09.494 --> 06:13.498
but I emptied out the trash,
threw away all the dirty dishes…

06:27.178 --> 06:28.012
Calling?

06:28.596 --> 06:29.430
Yeah, you?

06:29.514 --> 06:33.059
Nothing. Two years and counting.
What'd you see?

06:34.560 --> 06:35.395
Um…

06:35.978 --> 06:40.483
Cherry blossoms. The ocean.
There was a ship. It was like a freighter.

06:41.067 --> 06:43.945
I don't get the flowers,
but maybe something at the port?

06:44.779 --> 06:47.031
-Yeah, it's worth checking out.
-Well, I'll come.

06:47.115 --> 06:49.283
No, stay put. You need to be here
when he comes back.

06:49.367 --> 06:51.077
That could be days from now.

06:51.160 --> 06:52.161
-Hey.

06:53.121 --> 06:54.372
Camouflage.

07:32.660 --> 07:34.495
Cherry blossoms, here you are.

07:57.768 --> 07:58.978
Yeah, I see it.

09:00.039 --> 09:02.917
-Hey! I need help.
-What the hell? This area's restricted.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.794
NYPD. I need help getting him to the car.

09:04.877 --> 09:06.462
We're covered by Port Authority.
What gives?

09:06.546 --> 09:09.507
He needs medical attention, please.
Now! Come on!

09:21.519 --> 09:22.520
Hey.

09:23.271 --> 09:26.148
Where was this guy?
And why aren't you calling an ambulance?

09:36.826 --> 09:39.537
How many months you gonna stare
at the same patch of ocean?

09:40.246 --> 09:41.622
Different patch every day.

09:41.706 --> 09:45.126
And many more to come till our airplane
decides to present itself.

09:45.209 --> 09:47.003
I'm not holding my breath.

09:48.212 --> 09:51.591
We got a 911 call from the residence
of Anson and Trina Vasik.

09:51.674 --> 09:53.926
Row 12. D and E.

09:54.010 --> 09:56.679
Report of active vandalism.
Perpetrators on site.

09:56.762 --> 09:57.805
Greenpoint.

09:59.515 --> 10:01.559
Can we engage, please?
I can be there in ten.

10:01.642 --> 10:03.894
Well, let's see if NYPD handles it.

10:03.978 --> 10:07.857
We're trying to keep passengers safe,
not caught up in cross fire.

10:08.566 --> 10:10.192
Damn it! Come on!

10:12.945 --> 10:14.780
The Eureka footage again?

10:14.864 --> 10:16.616
I thought
you were supposed to be synthesizing

10:16.699 --> 10:18.159
the latest data from the test on Cal.

10:18.242 --> 10:20.328
I already have. His scans haven't changed.

10:20.911 --> 10:23.831
He's the exact same kid, except bigger.
And besides, this is my lunch break.

10:23.914 --> 10:25.958
This has been your lunch break
for 23 months.

10:27.043 --> 10:30.713
I need to figure out what made 828
disappear from Eureka and where it went.

10:30.796 --> 10:32.423
Every country around the globe

10:32.506 --> 10:34.967
conducted an exhaustive search
for 828 all over again.

10:35.051 --> 10:38.429
You are grasping at straws.
You have been for two years now.

10:38.512 --> 10:39.764
And? I won't stop.

10:41.766 --> 10:43.643
We're missing something.

11:31.232 --> 11:33.192
Hey. Any luck this time out?

11:33.275 --> 11:34.652
Nope.

11:37.196 --> 11:38.155
What are you doing?

11:40.866 --> 11:41.992
You don't feel the wind?

12:01.262 --> 12:03.514
Anna Ross? Why her?

12:04.014 --> 12:07.101
Her photo was fluttering, and
the wind stopped the second I touched it.

12:08.978 --> 12:10.563
She was the interpreter that helped us

12:10.646 --> 12:13.566
when you had a connection with a passenger
and got so sick.

12:14.150 --> 12:16.610
Doesn't this mean
you're supposed to go to her?

12:16.694 --> 12:18.446
I'll see if Mick can check in on her.

12:18.529 --> 12:22.867
Dad, follow your Calling.
Maybe it'll help you get out of your head.

12:22.950 --> 12:24.243
I don't wanna get out of my head.

12:24.326 --> 12:26.787
Besides, how many times
did I chase Calling after Calling,

12:26.871 --> 12:28.706
thinking it would lead me to Eden?

12:28.789 --> 12:29.623
Never did.

12:29.707 --> 12:31.542
Well, Mick's already on a Calling, so…

12:31.625 --> 12:32.793
Then it'll have to wait.

12:33.502 --> 12:35.629
But this is important.
I'll go talk to Anna.

12:35.713 --> 12:37.173
Cal, the world thinks you're missing.

12:37.256 --> 12:39.508
I don't like you being out there
if you don't have to be.

12:39.592 --> 12:40.426
Dad, how am I--

12:40.509 --> 12:43.429
Cal, if someone catches on that you're you
five and a half years older,

12:43.512 --> 12:47.558
they'll lock you up in an NSA lab,
and we'll never see you again.

12:47.641 --> 12:50.102
How am I supposed to find
what I'm looking for,

12:50.186 --> 12:54.774
what I was sent back for,
if I'm just stuck inside this house?

12:56.025 --> 12:57.818
The Lifeboat needs me.

13:06.285 --> 13:07.703
Take your Gabriel ID.

13:22.718 --> 13:24.220
I'm just here to help.

13:25.137 --> 13:27.681
The thing about addiction,
it can feel like…

13:28.182 --> 13:31.602
Feels like there's no way out.
Feels like counseling is useless.

13:31.685 --> 13:33.521
-It feels like--
-It is useless.

13:34.563 --> 13:37.900
Like I said, feels that way.
I've been in your seat. A few times.

13:38.901 --> 13:40.152
How'd you get out?

13:40.236 --> 13:43.906
Most of us self-medicate
to make our demons go away.

13:45.366 --> 13:48.869
I finally realized
my demons weren't going anywhere.

13:50.704 --> 13:51.956
They're a part of me.

13:52.540 --> 13:57.336
And they can rule my life,
or they can make me stronger.

14:21.819 --> 14:23.946
Stop trying to hide from your pain.

14:25.823 --> 14:26.866
Let it out.

14:28.158 --> 14:30.786
It's okay. It's okay.

14:36.417 --> 14:37.459
Let it out.

14:43.549 --> 14:44.466
All right.

14:49.722 --> 14:51.432
All right. I'm proud of you.

14:56.061 --> 14:56.896
Thank you.

14:56.979 --> 15:01.233
His last counselor almost quit.
How do you get through to these people?

15:01.817 --> 15:04.987
They do all the work.
I just feel their pain.

15:18.626 --> 15:19.793
You weren't followed?

15:19.877 --> 15:20.920
You really have to ask?

15:31.221 --> 15:32.431
Any idea who he is?

15:32.514 --> 15:35.476
No, the Calling brought me to him.
I think the freighter was from China.

15:43.567 --> 15:45.361
Hang in there, pal.
You've made it this far.

15:45.444 --> 15:46.487
Heartbeat's stable.

15:46.570 --> 15:48.697
Hopefully, the dehydration
didn't impact brain function.

15:48.781 --> 15:51.992
Stone 828. That's not freaky.
You think he's an 828er?

15:52.076 --> 15:53.869
If he is, why haven't we heard of him?

15:53.953 --> 15:57.539
'Cause he was killed two years ago.
Or so we thought.

15:57.623 --> 15:58.749
What do you mean?

15:58.832 --> 16:01.335
Thought I recognized that face.
It's Henry Kim.

16:01.418 --> 16:04.296
Supposedly executed
by the Singaporean government.

16:04.380 --> 16:06.674
The day… the day I quit the force.

16:07.341 --> 16:09.176
So, what? They told the world he's dead?

16:09.259 --> 16:10.594
Maybe traded him to China.

16:10.678 --> 16:13.389
They've done the most 828 studies
outside the US.

16:14.014 --> 16:17.267
So how the hell did he get here,
and what does he want from me?

16:17.351 --> 16:18.978
-Shh.

16:19.061 --> 16:21.188
Mr. Kim? Hey, can you hear me, sir?

16:21.271 --> 16:22.231
You're safe.

16:23.273 --> 16:24.441
Boy.

16:25.192 --> 16:26.527
Where's the boy?

16:27.236 --> 16:29.780
I don't think you're the Stone
he's looking for.

16:31.240 --> 16:32.199
Cal.

16:42.668 --> 16:45.212
-Yes?
-Hi. You're Anna Ross?

16:46.130 --> 16:48.757
If you're from the Registry,
my check-in's not for another week.

16:48.841 --> 16:50.759
I'm sorry. No, I'm Gabriel.

16:50.843 --> 16:52.886
I left a message earlier.

16:52.970 --> 16:57.141
The Stone family from 828.
I'm one of their cousins.

16:57.725 --> 16:59.059
Okay. And?

16:59.143 --> 17:03.022
And I know you helped Michaela save Cal.

17:03.105 --> 17:04.982
-Thank you.

17:06.442 --> 17:08.360
Cal's dad, Ben,

17:09.069 --> 17:12.072
he had a Calling, a vision, sort of.

17:12.156 --> 17:14.783
Wind blowing.
He thinks you may be having it also.

17:16.869 --> 17:18.537
Are you, Anna?

17:24.460 --> 17:25.753
I know it sounds crazy,

17:25.836 --> 17:28.672
but I think the 828 Registry
bugged my house.

17:29.339 --> 17:31.008
That doesn't sound so crazy.

17:33.719 --> 17:35.304
I don't understand.

17:35.804 --> 17:38.557
If Ben had this Calling,

17:39.683 --> 17:40.893
why'd he send you?

17:41.602 --> 17:44.521
He's, uh, not in a good place.

17:44.605 --> 17:46.273
Hasn't been for a long time.

17:46.774 --> 17:50.319
Yes, I remember
all the news reports about the tragedy.

17:50.944 --> 17:51.904
Unthinkable.

17:52.404 --> 17:55.032
I'm sorry for your loss.

17:55.866 --> 17:56.700
Thank you.

17:57.451 --> 17:59.495
Uh, so, the Calling?

18:00.704 --> 18:04.166
I had one today, yesterday.

18:04.249 --> 18:05.084
Wind?

18:05.876 --> 18:07.503
Actually, a windmill.

18:08.504 --> 18:10.339
Wow, okay. Yeah. You saw one?

18:10.964 --> 18:16.720
More like I just had the idea
and picked up a pen and started drawing.

18:17.221 --> 18:19.181
I'm sure that sounds strange.

18:19.264 --> 18:20.224
No…

18:21.308 --> 18:23.936
I've heard that's how
the Callings come sometimes.

18:25.145 --> 18:27.106
Did you draw anything else?

18:28.107 --> 18:29.316
Gravestones.

18:30.234 --> 18:34.446
At least I think that's what they were.
They scared the hell out of me.

18:35.030 --> 18:38.450
There's a cemetery upstate in Ramapo
with an old windmill.

18:38.534 --> 18:40.619
That's it. That's the same as my drawing.

18:43.580 --> 18:46.333
I'm so sorry. I… I have to go.

18:46.416 --> 18:48.752
Well, you were incredibly helpful.
Thank you.

18:48.836 --> 18:50.921
I'll take the next train.
I'll check it out.

18:51.004 --> 18:51.964
Okay.

18:56.051 --> 18:58.637
So Vance thinks
they faked Henry Kim's execution

18:58.720 --> 19:01.140
so they could have a lab rat
that no one was looking for.

19:01.223 --> 19:03.642
Do you know, um,
where his background file is?

19:06.812 --> 19:08.814
So this guy, he risks his life to escape.

19:08.897 --> 19:11.608
He ships himself
halfway across the world for Cal.

19:11.692 --> 19:13.944
I mean, this could be
the breakthrough we're looking for.

19:15.904 --> 19:17.781
I can't-- I don't know where his file is.

19:18.991 --> 19:19.992
Ben?

19:21.618 --> 19:22.494
Ben!

19:23.162 --> 19:24.663
Did you hear anything I just said?

19:24.746 --> 19:27.040
It's not the breakthrough
I've been looking for.

19:27.833 --> 19:29.459
How do you even say that to me?

19:33.130 --> 19:36.508
If Eden were still out there, the Callings
would've led us to her by now.

19:36.592 --> 19:38.385
-You know that.
-I <i>don't </i>know that.

19:38.468 --> 19:41.471
Okay, fine, but I'm not asking you
to give up on Eden.

19:41.555 --> 19:43.473
I'm asking you
not to give up on the rest of us

19:43.557 --> 19:45.267
because the Death Date
is a year and a half--

19:45.350 --> 19:46.935
I don't care about the Death Date.

19:49.271 --> 19:50.606
What's the point anymore?

19:51.440 --> 19:52.274
Okay.

19:53.108 --> 19:56.904
Listen, I know you don't mean that,
but I'm gonna humor you for a second

19:56.987 --> 19:59.740
because the point of living
is your family.

19:59.823 --> 20:02.659
You still have two children
who are here <i>now,</i>

20:02.743 --> 20:05.829
and they need their father. You still have
your dad. You still have me.

20:05.913 --> 20:09.875
And I'm sorry. I'm not gonna let you
give up on us to chase a pipe dream.

20:09.958 --> 20:10.792
Don't call it that!

20:10.876 --> 20:13.503
Ben, I'm tired
of walking on eggshells around you.

20:13.587 --> 20:17.341
I have tried to give you space.
I have tried to captain the Lifeboat--

20:17.424 --> 20:19.927
-I didn't ask you to.
-You didn't give me a choice!

20:20.510 --> 20:23.722
You left me alone.
And I understood. I still do.

20:23.805 --> 20:29.019
But I'm now trying to save every other
passenger that is on that plane.

20:29.102 --> 20:33.357
At this point, I have zero faith
in the Callings saving any of us.

20:35.025 --> 20:36.235
What if you're wrong?

20:38.946 --> 20:39.863
Look.

20:41.114 --> 20:42.449
The Callings have you.

20:42.950 --> 20:45.994
They have Saanvi.
They have every single passenger.

20:46.078 --> 20:48.121
Eden has no one other than me.

20:51.959 --> 20:53.210
Hey, what's going on?

20:54.211 --> 20:55.712
I'll explain on the way.

20:55.796 --> 20:58.382
I need you to find
Henry Kim's file, please.

20:58.882 --> 21:03.178
Uh, Dad, that woman
whose photo was blowing, Anna Ross.

21:03.262 --> 21:05.389
-Yeah.
-She saw a windmill and gravestones.

21:05.472 --> 21:07.391
She's sharing a Calling with you.

21:07.474 --> 21:11.061
She's headed up to a cemetery in Ramapo,
and she could use your help.

21:12.145 --> 21:13.647
Go with Mick.

21:27.536 --> 21:29.496
Make sure you eat something, Dad.

21:45.804 --> 21:47.431
We expecting anybody?

21:48.098 --> 21:49.141
I'm not.

21:49.808 --> 21:50.809
Just hang back.

21:57.232 --> 21:58.608
-Hey.
-Hey.

22:00.319 --> 22:02.029
-Long time.
-Yeah.

22:02.904 --> 22:05.282
Um, hey. Ca-- It's… it's okay.

22:06.199 --> 22:07.326
Hey.

22:07.409 --> 22:09.202
-Hey, Jared.
-What's up, Cal?

22:10.037 --> 22:11.621
-Sorry, Gabe.
-Mm-hmm.

22:11.705 --> 22:13.498
-I'm liking the stubble, old man.

22:13.582 --> 22:15.834
Yeah! Hey.

22:18.295 --> 22:21.048
All right, uh, I'll wait in the car.

22:21.131 --> 22:23.633
-It's good to see you.
-You too, bud. Take care.

22:26.303 --> 22:28.472
-Now isn't really a good time to…

22:29.139 --> 22:30.599
Sorry. I'm just here to see Ben.

22:32.934 --> 22:34.186
You're still in your blues.

22:34.269 --> 22:36.646
Yeah, over a year now.

22:37.439 --> 22:39.274
Price you pay for doing the right thing.

22:40.400 --> 22:41.693
We all appreciate it.

22:43.236 --> 22:44.196
Um…

22:44.696 --> 22:46.490
-Well, I should…
-Yeah. He all the way up?

22:46.573 --> 22:47.866
-Mm, yeah.
-Okay.

22:58.502 --> 22:59.669
Police.

23:04.424 --> 23:05.550
You got a second?

23:06.176 --> 23:09.471
Not unless you're here to tell me NYPD
is actually gonna do something for once

23:09.554 --> 23:10.931
to help find my daughter.

23:12.641 --> 23:14.601
They won't even return my calls.

23:16.603 --> 23:17.604
Ben, brother…

23:18.980 --> 23:20.816
Hey. You need to take a break, man.

23:20.899 --> 23:23.860
I'm never gonna take a break.
Does nobody get that?

23:28.198 --> 23:29.324
Not until I find her.

23:30.826 --> 23:34.079
Ben, there's a reason
the detectives aren't calling you back.

23:44.464 --> 23:46.842
The state legally declared Eden deceased.

23:46.925 --> 23:49.136
NYPD closed the missing persons file.

23:50.637 --> 23:53.348
I wanted you to hear it from a friend,
not just some random suit.

24:03.775 --> 24:05.444
-No.
-Ben.

24:06.319 --> 24:08.947
Ben, Angelina and Eden's prints
were found on that bridge.

24:09.948 --> 24:12.451
They found her backpack floating
in the Narrows days after Grace--

24:12.534 --> 24:15.412
-Yeah, but no bodies! Why no bodies?
-We've been through this, Ben.

24:15.495 --> 24:18.206
The currents. They would have
pulled them into the Atlantic.

24:18.290 --> 24:20.625
We weren't expecting
on finding any bodies.

24:21.418 --> 24:23.086
I know she's out there. She's alive.

24:23.170 --> 24:25.338
And if the NYPD won't look for her,
screw them.

24:25.422 --> 24:26.882
And screw you, Jared!

24:26.965 --> 24:28.091
I won't stop.

24:30.010 --> 24:30.886
I can't.

24:33.138 --> 24:34.139
I'm really sorry.

24:58.705 --> 25:01.333
We need a BOLO on Angelina Meyer.

25:01.416 --> 25:05.212
110 pounds. 5'2", brown hair.

25:05.295 --> 25:07.047
She has a 16-month-old female infant…

25:07.130 --> 25:08.465
I'll make you some tea.

25:08.548 --> 25:10.258
…and she's armed and dangerous.

25:11.092 --> 25:14.054
We need a roadblock
at every toll booth up until the border.

25:14.137 --> 25:16.348
Where are we on the Amber Alert?

25:16.932 --> 25:19.851
You need your wife.
Where is she?

25:23.522 --> 25:24.606
She's gone.

25:25.774 --> 25:28.443
Well, I'll sit here with you
till she gets back.

25:35.492 --> 25:36.326
Can I help you?

25:41.957 --> 25:42.791
Is that you?

25:45.585 --> 25:46.836
Oh my God.

25:51.508 --> 25:52.592
Dad!

26:06.189 --> 26:07.190
How?

26:08.108 --> 26:09.901
Mom kicked Angelina out.

26:10.652 --> 26:14.322
You were the only person
who wanted her back in the house.

26:16.199 --> 26:17.993
How'd she get in the house, Cal?

26:21.830 --> 26:23.748
I told her about the key.

26:24.958 --> 26:25.917
What?

26:26.835 --> 26:27.877
I knew it.

26:27.961 --> 26:30.922
I'm sorry. I thought the Calling wanted--

26:31.006 --> 26:33.633
Mom told you she wanted her gone.

26:34.217 --> 26:35.969
We told you not to trust her.

26:38.305 --> 26:40.098
And you didn't listen!

26:41.349 --> 26:43.143
And now Mom is dead!

26:43.685 --> 26:46.104
-You let her take Eden! It's your fault!
-Olive! Olive!

26:46.855 --> 26:50.108
You let her take Eden!
You let her take Eden!

26:50.650 --> 26:52.485
It's all your fault!

27:01.077 --> 27:04.289
-Come on, bud. Let's get you cleaned up.

27:12.255 --> 27:14.758
I've pumped him full of fluids.
His oxygen sats are still low.

27:14.841 --> 27:16.885
I'm starting to worry
about his heart and his lungs.

27:16.968 --> 27:19.262
Henry, you're safe.
We're not here to harm you.

27:19.346 --> 27:20.263
We wanna help.

27:21.973 --> 27:24.017
I almost shot this guy. Waltzed right in.

27:24.100 --> 27:25.769
Not exactly an open-door policy.

27:25.852 --> 27:28.688
Sorry. Mick gave me the code.
Said you could use some help?

27:28.772 --> 27:32.025
Yeah, he's showing
clear signs of starvation,

27:32.108 --> 27:34.235
sensory deprivation, erratic breathing.

27:35.320 --> 27:37.280
-Mind if I try something?
-Be my guest.

28:00.261 --> 28:02.597
Heart rate's going down.
Oxygen levels are going up.

28:04.599 --> 28:06.726
Whatever he went through,
he's still suffering.

28:06.810 --> 28:08.311
You can waltz in any time.

28:09.646 --> 28:10.939
I gotta get back to work.

28:39.175 --> 28:41.052
The box

28:42.637 --> 28:46.141
is for the boy.

28:48.143 --> 28:49.853
What box? There's no box.

28:49.936 --> 28:53.064
I had it with me.

28:53.690 --> 28:58.194
I need to give it to the boy.

28:59.779 --> 29:02.657
Okay, I need to sedate him, Vance,
before he goes into cardiac arrest.

29:02.741 --> 29:04.200
Send Michaela back to the port.

29:04.284 --> 29:06.161
Hopefully, whatever's in the box
is still there.

29:48.787 --> 29:49.788
Oh my God.

29:53.625 --> 29:54.667
Eden.

30:10.892 --> 30:11.768
Anna.

30:13.269 --> 30:14.938
Ben? You're here.

30:15.021 --> 30:16.439
Did you find anything?

30:16.523 --> 30:20.276
Well, I haven't been here long,
but this Calling…

30:20.360 --> 30:22.946
I don't even know what
we're supposed to be looking for.

30:23.029 --> 30:26.115
I do. It's my daughter, Eden.

30:26.699 --> 30:27.617
Oh my goodness.

30:29.410 --> 30:31.454
I… I thought she had passed.

30:32.288 --> 30:33.206
She hasn't.

30:34.874 --> 30:38.336
And I've never been more certain
that she's alive than I am right now.

30:40.797 --> 30:42.131
Where would she be?

30:43.132 --> 30:44.843
I haven't seen anyone around.

30:47.554 --> 30:48.596
You feel that?

30:49.305 --> 30:50.265
I don't know.

30:58.565 --> 31:00.108
The weather vane. Look.

31:01.860 --> 31:03.570
It's pointing in the other direction.

31:04.904 --> 31:06.614
This isn't a real gust.

31:06.698 --> 31:07.699
It's a Calling.

31:09.492 --> 31:11.244
It's gonna lead us straight to Eden.

31:18.877 --> 31:21.504
Do you have any idea why
Henry asked for you? What's in the box?

31:21.588 --> 31:23.673
I don't even remember him from the plane.

31:26.217 --> 31:28.344
Homeland Security's already here.
We gotta come back.

31:28.428 --> 31:31.014
No, we have to find it.
The answers are here.

31:31.097 --> 31:33.057
-I know it.
-Cal, no, it's not safe for 828ers.

31:33.141 --> 31:35.351
They're gonna spot us, okay?
You-- We can't.

31:35.435 --> 31:38.605
Well, just you, not me. I can do this.

31:38.688 --> 31:40.690
-Cal--
-Just tell me how to find the container.

31:44.193 --> 31:45.069
Hey.

31:48.656 --> 31:49.866
Camouflage.

31:56.998 --> 31:58.207
I need an assist.

32:09.344 --> 32:10.678
Eden!

32:16.976 --> 32:18.394
You're gonna head towards the water.

32:18.478 --> 32:20.480
There's a stack of containers
right beside the ship.

32:21.230 --> 32:23.274
<i>You gotta slow down.</i>
<i>You're walking way too fast.</i>

32:23.358 --> 32:25.234
This is how I walk.

32:25.318 --> 32:26.361
Well, it's suspicious.

32:26.444 --> 32:27.403
<i>Slow down.</i>

32:27.487 --> 32:29.072
Can I get a word in here?

32:29.155 --> 32:30.406
Vance?

32:30.949 --> 32:33.326
Long time no see. Stop walking.

32:34.160 --> 32:36.329
-You can see me?
-<i>I can.</i>

32:36.412 --> 32:39.332
I can also see a couple of feds
talking to some dockworkers

32:39.415 --> 32:41.167
around the container you're next to.

32:43.920 --> 32:46.714
And now I see you're about
to be in their eyeline. Get back.

32:47.298 --> 32:48.132
Sorry.

32:48.216 --> 32:49.342
<i>All you Stones.</i>

32:49.425 --> 32:51.803
You're like moths to a flame
when it comes to danger.

32:51.886 --> 32:53.096
Is that a metaphor?

32:53.179 --> 32:55.306
-'Cause I missed high school.

32:55.390 --> 32:58.935
Okay, Cal?
Henry's container is the third aisle in.

32:59.018 --> 33:00.937
<i>It's blue.</i>
<i>It's got a cherry blossom on it.</i>

33:02.188 --> 33:04.774
Third aisle, blue, cherry blossom. Got it.

33:04.857 --> 33:05.984
Vance, just say when.

33:06.067 --> 33:07.902
Now, they're about to walk away.

33:07.986 --> 33:09.237
When I say--

33:10.321 --> 33:11.614
Not that "when"!

33:15.326 --> 33:17.203
Okay, Cal. Can you see it?

33:18.454 --> 33:21.124
-All right, good. You need to--
-Mm. Not good.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.502
There's more than a dozen federal agents
and cops en route.

33:25.795 --> 33:29.090
This is a, uh, coincidence.

33:29.173 --> 33:30.675
Hmm. You tell me.

33:31.426 --> 33:35.847
I'm here 'cause I heard 828 activity
over the scanner. That would be you?

33:38.099 --> 33:41.352
I don't know what you got yourself and Cal
into, Mick, but I don't want to know.

33:41.436 --> 33:45.231
-I'm not asking you for favors.
-That's good 'cause I can't help you.

33:45.314 --> 33:47.316
-Yeah.

33:49.694 --> 33:51.779
I haven't seen you in, what, six months?

33:51.863 --> 33:54.240
Now I see you twice in one day.
What are the odds?

33:54.907 --> 33:58.036
-Must be a sign.
-Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of.

33:59.537 --> 34:00.580
Mm-hmm.

34:02.707 --> 34:04.751
You look good. Happy.

34:05.752 --> 34:07.128
-I am.
-Good.

34:08.337 --> 34:09.255
Me too.

34:10.631 --> 34:11.507
I'm glad.

34:13.634 --> 34:17.388
-All right. Where is that nephew of yours?
-Um…

34:19.599 --> 34:22.226
<i>Cops are closing in</i>
<i>a couple containers away.</i>

34:28.399 --> 34:30.359
Wait, I hear something.

34:30.443 --> 34:31.486
<i>A ticking.</i>

34:31.569 --> 34:33.571
Cal, get out of there. It could be a bomb.

34:33.654 --> 34:36.491
It's getting louder and faster.

34:36.574 --> 34:39.160
God damn it, Henry.
What the hell did you do?

34:39.243 --> 34:41.496
<i>I don't hear anything, but get out.</i>

34:41.579 --> 34:42.580
You don't?

34:46.667 --> 34:47.752
It's a Calling.

34:49.879 --> 34:51.339
Hold on. I see something.

34:51.422 --> 34:52.924
<i>It might be a box. Hold on. I'll show--</i>

34:53.007 --> 34:56.177
Do not open it. I repeat, do not open it.

35:06.646 --> 35:08.397
My God.

35:09.065 --> 35:10.483
It's not just a box.

35:10.566 --> 35:11.442
What is it?

35:11.943 --> 35:13.486
<i>It's the black box.</i>

35:26.207 --> 35:28.626
It stopped. Did it stop for you?

35:29.669 --> 35:30.795
Yes.

35:30.878 --> 35:32.463
Daddy!

35:33.047 --> 35:34.048
Eden.

35:39.137 --> 35:40.721
Daddy!

35:40.805 --> 35:41.722
Eden!

35:44.809 --> 35:46.144
-Eden!
-Daddy!

35:46.227 --> 35:49.021
Eden! I got you.

35:51.065 --> 35:51.941
Hey.

35:53.734 --> 35:55.319
Daddy!

36:02.034 --> 36:04.370
Ben! You have to help him!

36:06.289 --> 36:07.498
He's drowning.

36:08.166 --> 36:09.542
Ben!

36:11.210 --> 36:12.503
Help him!

36:15.173 --> 36:17.508
Here, take him.
I'm gonna go help your daddy.

36:17.592 --> 36:19.093
Call 911!

36:59.592 --> 37:00.843
Oh my God.

37:05.514 --> 37:06.349
Hey.

37:07.099 --> 37:09.185
I'm so sorry about your mom.

37:10.978 --> 37:12.396
All of this is my fault.

37:12.480 --> 37:14.565
No. No.

37:17.235 --> 37:20.196
It's gonna take time, but you'll be okay.
You'll all be okay.

37:20.279 --> 37:23.491
None of this makes any sense.
Look at me. I'm a freak.

37:25.117 --> 37:27.828
No. I don't know how in the world
you got to be so big,

37:27.912 --> 37:29.789
but I know your heart's exactly the same.

37:34.835 --> 37:37.088
What happened to you out there?

37:38.631 --> 37:42.301
I don't even know anymore.
It's like waking up from a dream.

37:42.927 --> 37:44.095
Think, Cal.

37:44.804 --> 37:46.013
It's important.

37:48.099 --> 37:49.850
We have to get back onto the plane.

37:50.851 --> 37:52.937
All of the answers are on the plane.
I know it.

37:53.020 --> 37:54.855
When can you take me back to Eureka?

37:58.526 --> 38:00.236
-What is it?

38:03.406 --> 38:05.199
The plane's gone, Cal.

38:21.382 --> 38:22.717
You're in a good mood.

38:23.217 --> 38:24.343
It's been a while.

38:25.928 --> 38:28.347
Every day for two years,

38:30.016 --> 38:31.934
two really hard years,

38:33.144 --> 38:35.938
I've been trying to figure out
where it all went wrong.

38:37.606 --> 38:38.649
Mom's dead.

38:39.150 --> 38:40.568
Eden's gone.

38:41.569 --> 38:43.654
I'm… older,

38:44.238 --> 38:47.199
and I don't have answers for any of it.

38:47.825 --> 38:49.160
Cal, that's a lot.

38:51.120 --> 38:52.788
The point is, uh,

38:53.789 --> 38:57.293
every day, I think
if I can just get back to the plane,

38:57.376 --> 38:59.754
maybe I can fix all this, and…

39:00.921 --> 39:04.175
Today, I finally had a Calling again,

39:04.258 --> 39:08.262
and it feels like the plane's
sort of come back to me now.

39:12.808 --> 39:13.976
Hey.

39:15.519 --> 39:16.437
Come on.

39:19.106 --> 39:20.566
It's unbelievable.

39:21.233 --> 39:23.277
It disappeared from Eureka,
and now it's back.

39:23.361 --> 39:27.656
It is definitely the exact same black box
of Flight 828, voice recording and all.

39:27.740 --> 39:28.616
You're sure?

39:28.699 --> 39:32.787
We spent years examining
every millimeter of it inside and out.

39:32.870 --> 39:35.081
See next to the burned-out fuselage?
That's a black box.

39:35.164 --> 39:38.250
It was right there till it disappeared
with the rest of the plane.

39:38.334 --> 39:41.170
Probably at the very moment
Angelina killed Grace,

39:41.253 --> 39:44.215
just like the tail fin disappeared
the moment I killed the major.

39:44.298 --> 39:45.466
Okay. So how is it back?

39:45.549 --> 39:47.802
And how did Henry get it
halfway across the world?

39:47.885 --> 39:51.430
How did the Cuban fisherman
find the tail fin? Who knows?

39:51.514 --> 39:53.974
If the black box came back,
where's the rest of the plane?

39:54.975 --> 39:57.895
Boy. Where's the boy?

39:58.938 --> 40:01.315
Boy? Boy?

40:02.483 --> 40:03.484
Boy?

40:10.991 --> 40:13.411
You are the boy.

40:16.789 --> 40:19.125
He wasn't even looking at--
How'd he know it was me?

40:19.208 --> 40:20.918
That is a very good question.

40:21.001 --> 40:23.546
Apparently, you are exactly
who he was looking for.

40:30.386 --> 40:33.431
Hey, we should, um… We should go.
I think Ben had a tough day.

40:34.014 --> 40:36.100
Can you guys keep an eye on Henry
and the black box?

40:36.684 --> 40:39.228
-Keep us posted if he wakes up.
-You got it.

40:39.770 --> 40:42.565
Please tell Ben that we're here for him.
All of us.

41:22.605 --> 41:24.440
I'll pray for your little girl.

41:56.847 --> 41:58.516
<i>Maintaining level altitude.</i>

41:59.225 --> 42:00.476
<i>Please help!</i>

42:01.810 --> 42:03.062
<i>…level altitude.</i>

42:03.145 --> 42:04.438
<i>Help me!</i>

42:04.522 --> 42:05.481
Vance!

42:07.316 --> 42:08.776
<i>Maintaining level altitude.</i>

42:08.859 --> 42:09.860
<i>Help me!</i>

42:09.944 --> 42:14.198
<i>I'm terribly sorry, folks.</i>
<i>That was extreme turbulence--</i>

42:14.698 --> 42:15.574
Play it again.

42:15.658 --> 42:18.786
Okay, one sec. One sec. Let me sync up
the surveillance footage from Eureka.

42:19.620 --> 42:20.788
<i>Help me!</i>

42:22.665 --> 42:25.793
But the black box voice recording
is from the original flight.

42:25.876 --> 42:27.920
So how the hell do we hear 'em in Eureka?

42:28.587 --> 42:29.421
No idea.

42:29.922 --> 42:34.093
But the black box is back for a reason,
and it's talking to us.

42:34.176 --> 42:35.678
So we need to listen.

42:37.012 --> 42:38.764
Maybe Daly is still out there.

42:46.438 --> 42:47.690
Dad, I'm so sorry.

42:49.316 --> 42:50.651
I'm so sorry.

42:54.029 --> 42:55.155
What happened?

42:56.407 --> 42:58.784
I thought it was Eden. I was sure of it.

42:59.660 --> 43:02.538
I heard "Daddy." I--

43:02.621 --> 43:04.707
You followed the Calling. Tried so hard.

43:04.790 --> 43:07.710
I thought…
I thought something good would happen.

43:07.793 --> 43:09.545
Something good did happen.

43:09.628 --> 43:12.548
Ben just saved
a dad and his son from drowning.

43:13.215 --> 43:14.258
Yeah, well…

43:15.384 --> 43:18.887
Once again, the Callings
just keep toying with me.

43:29.940 --> 43:31.066
Look, I…

43:32.693 --> 43:34.737
I get what you've been trying to do.

43:35.446 --> 43:36.822
I think we all do.

43:38.198 --> 43:41.035
But it's… Maybe it's time we said goodbye.

43:42.703 --> 43:43.662
We all miss her.

43:44.496 --> 43:47.082
It's okay to… to let go.

43:49.960 --> 43:52.588
Your mom is gone, and, uh…

43:57.092 --> 43:58.427
that almost destroyed me.

43:59.678 --> 44:01.597
And still, I…

44:03.098 --> 44:05.059
I struggle to breathe.

44:07.144 --> 44:08.145
Uh…

44:21.533 --> 44:22.701
I owe it to her.

44:26.622 --> 44:27.456
To all of us.

44:29.667 --> 44:30.626
To find Eden.

44:31.835 --> 44:33.754
I have to hang on to that hope.

44:40.761 --> 44:42.638
I'm never gonna stop looking for her.

45:44.491 --> 45:45.784
Look, happy.

45:47.619 --> 45:48.454
Let's see.

45:49.204 --> 45:51.415
Another one. I love it.

45:52.124 --> 45:53.208
Come here.

45:54.668 --> 45:57.004
Oh. Hmm.

46:00.382 --> 46:01.884
We need to talk.

46:03.635 --> 46:04.470
Keep coloring.

46:08.432 --> 46:09.600
Did you solve it?

46:09.683 --> 46:13.979
Yes, but I had help… from Ben Stone.

46:14.855 --> 46:17.232
He had the same Calling as Eden.

46:18.525 --> 46:19.985
Something's coming.

46:20.819 --> 46:22.237
Something terrifying.

46:24.740 --> 46:26.700
Can I have a cookie, Mommy?

46:30.329 --> 46:32.581
Anything for you, my angel.

46:37.127 --> 46:38.378
Then we have to go.
