WEBVTT

00:02.127 --> 00:04.587
You can't fire me, l quit.

00:05.130 --> 00:06.631
Think you can replace me
with some other guy?

00:06.715 --> 00:09.175
Go ahead, it won't be the same.

00:09.468 --> 00:11.969
You may think l'm losing, but l'm not. l'm...

00:12.054 --> 00:13.888
Anyway, you get the idea.

00:15.724 --> 00:17.308
And those are just some generic examples

00:17.393 --> 00:20.978
of frustrations you can take out on Bobo,
our new bopping bag,

00:21.063 --> 00:23.064
to express your anger in a healthy way.

00:23.148 --> 00:25.149
Okay, our new member should be
showing up any minute,

00:25.234 --> 00:29.112
so while we're waiting, let's see how we all
did with our assignment over the weekend.

00:29.196 --> 00:31.572
You were supposed to admit to a loved one
that you're in anger therapy.

00:31.657 --> 00:33.324
-Patrick, how'd it go?
-Not well.

00:34.410 --> 00:38.204
l told my dad that l was coming here to
change my passive-aggressive behavior,

00:38.288 --> 00:40.957
and he said, "While you're there,
can you work on not being gay?"

00:43.210 --> 00:46.838
Okay. Did you handle that in a healthy way
or with a passive-aggressive act?

00:46.964 --> 00:49.549
l sent everyone in my family
a Fourth of July card

00:49.633 --> 00:51.551
with a picture of me dressed
as the Statue of Liberty

00:51.635 --> 00:53.511
with a sparkler sticking out of my ass.

00:55.305 --> 00:58.850
Patrick, that's not a passive-aggressive act,
it's the whole play.

00:58.934 --> 01:00.727
l can print it out and bring it in if you like.

01:00.811 --> 01:01.936
Please do.

01:02.020 --> 01:04.522
While l was in Nam, dodging enemy fire

01:04.606 --> 01:06.274
and watching my best friends die,

01:06.358 --> 01:09.610
l kept telling myself, "Hang in there, Ed,
because one of these days

01:09.695 --> 01:14.282
"this queer is gonna shove a sparkler up
his ass and it'll all be worth it."

01:17.077 --> 01:19.912
Okay, Ed, another dollar in the queerjar.

01:21.915 --> 01:23.374
Who did you tell about your anger therapy?

01:23.459 --> 01:27.295
Well, l was gonna tell one of my best
friends, but he died so this queer...

01:27.504 --> 01:28.588
Ed!

01:29.798 --> 01:32.633
You're gonna give the Gay Men's Choir
a hell of a holiday party, Ed.

01:34.428 --> 01:35.511
How about you, Nolan?

01:35.596 --> 01:39.098
Okay, well, l told this girl l went out with

01:39.183 --> 01:41.476
that my problem is
l'm attracted to angry people.

01:42.394 --> 01:43.853
She thought l was talking about her,

01:43.937 --> 01:45.813
so she screamed at me for like an hour.

01:45.898 --> 01:47.398
Very belittling things.

01:48.859 --> 01:49.942
Very belittling.

01:52.988 --> 01:54.989
Who's the stupid therapist here?

01:55.699 --> 01:57.992
l guess that would be me.

01:58.494 --> 02:01.037
Your idiot neighbor
is yelling at me for no reason.

02:01.121 --> 02:02.413
l've got a can of Mace in my purse

02:02.498 --> 02:04.749
and l am not afraid
to bash his skull in with it.

02:05.209 --> 02:08.294
Hey, everybody, our new member is here.

02:08.378 --> 02:11.756
Excuse me, miss,
you just drove over my lawn.

02:11.840 --> 02:13.591
l'm gonna have to reseed the whole thing.

02:13.675 --> 02:15.885
Might want to throw some seeds up on
that bald head of yours.

02:15.969 --> 02:18.262
He's tried everything.
Mike, let's step outside.

02:18.347 --> 02:19.764
This is a choice.

02:21.683 --> 02:22.767
What's going on over here, Charlie?

02:22.851 --> 02:24.936
l'm sorry, Mike.
l'm doing sessions at the house now.

02:25.020 --> 02:26.562
l'll cover you for the lawn.

02:26.897 --> 02:28.481
Get me her phone number,
and we'll call it even?

02:29.233 --> 02:30.900
Forget it. She's here by court order.

02:30.984 --> 02:32.777
l like a fixer-upper.

02:33.529 --> 02:37.365
This is the house from PoItergeist.
l'll see you later.

02:38.325 --> 02:41.077
So what's the deal?
l asked for a female therapist.

02:41.161 --> 02:44.121
Really? Criminal court system is usually
so accommodating.

02:44.206 --> 02:47.041
Next time, go through their concierge.

02:47.125 --> 02:51.504
Everybody, this is Lacey.
Lacey, this is Ed, Patrick, Nolan, and Bobo.

02:51.672 --> 02:54.006
Now, Bobo is here in case you feel the need
to physicalize your anger,

02:54.091 --> 02:55.591
you can punch him in the face.

02:55.676 --> 02:57.218
All right, l'll give it a shot.

02:57.302 --> 03:01.055
No, no, no, no! No. No. That's not Bobo.
That's Ed.

03:01.181 --> 03:03.057
Look, l don't even belong here.

03:03.141 --> 03:06.352
The court just wants you to sign this piece
of paper that says l showed up.

03:07.145 --> 03:09.939
You sign it now, l can bounce and you can
check out my ass when l leave.

03:10.858 --> 03:13.484
l've already checked out your ass.
lt's one of the best ones in the group.

03:14.903 --> 03:17.613
lt'll look even better if you put it in
that chair so we can start.

03:20.742 --> 03:21.993
l would like to talk about something.

03:22.077 --> 03:23.286
l said it was one of the best.

03:23.370 --> 03:24.579
Okay, thank you.

03:28.250 --> 03:31.377
So, Lacey, why don't you tell us a little bit
about why you're here?

03:31.670 --> 03:33.671
l have no idea. l'm not angry.

03:33.755 --> 03:35.882
My boyfriend cheated on me,
so l shot him in the balls.

03:38.135 --> 03:39.594
Bet he's angry.

03:44.308 --> 03:46.767
Before l went back to school
and became a therapist,

03:47.269 --> 03:51.439
l was an angry, out-of-control ballplayer.
You need to watch this.

03:52.941 --> 03:54.150
That's me behind the plate.

03:54.234 --> 03:56.777
After nine years in the minors,
l finally got called up to the show.

03:59.197 --> 04:01.282
Simple pop-up. What can go wrong?

04:05.579 --> 04:09.290
Look how mad he is.
You look like a bull getting a prostate exam.

04:11.251 --> 04:14.378
Wait, wait, here it comes. Here it comes.

04:16.298 --> 04:18.966
He broke his own knee
and ruined his career.

04:20.802 --> 04:22.637
That's still funny as hell.

04:24.306 --> 04:26.891
You know, Ed, you make jokes like that
because you're insecure,

04:26.975 --> 04:28.851
so you denigrate others
to feel better about yourself.

04:29.811 --> 04:31.020
l know.

04:33.523 --> 04:37.735
The point is anger took away something
that l really loved.

04:38.153 --> 04:39.987
And l'm here to try to keep
that from happening to you.

04:41.907 --> 04:44.825
Hey, can l watch that again?
l want to see if l still don't care.

04:48.038 --> 04:50.081
Oh, sorry, Dad. Forgot it was Thursday.

04:50.165 --> 04:52.750
No, Sam, it's okay. Come on in.
Everybody, my daughter, Sam.

04:52.918 --> 04:54.168
Hi, Sam.

04:54.252 --> 04:56.879
Hi. l'll just be a second
and l'll be out of your way.

05:01.510 --> 05:02.843
Tough day?

05:03.303 --> 05:04.845
No, everything's fine.

05:07.140 --> 05:09.934
l know l'm new, but this is weird, right?

05:10.268 --> 05:11.769
She's got OCD.

05:13.021 --> 05:14.772
And you smell good.

05:15.399 --> 05:17.525
Okay, you're in my bubble, assclown.

05:19.236 --> 05:21.862
Cool. We're doing nicknames.

05:24.700 --> 05:26.450
lt's all good. Bye.

05:31.415 --> 05:34.125
Hey, let's take a short break.
She only does that when she's stressed.

05:34.751 --> 05:36.711
Nolan, stay away from Lacey.
Lacey, stay away from everybody.

05:36.795 --> 05:39.422
Patrick, stay away from Ed.
Ed, well, you all know the drill.

05:43.260 --> 05:44.510
Come in.

05:46.138 --> 05:47.722
Hey, Sam. Something bothering you?

05:47.806 --> 05:48.931
No.

05:49.349 --> 05:51.976
Are you sure?
l feel like there's an elephant in the room.

05:52.602 --> 05:54.729
l mean, it could be under all those clothes.

05:55.981 --> 05:59.150
Why am l doing all this stupid homework
if l'm not even sure l'm going to college?

05:59.234 --> 06:01.986
What? Of course you're going to college.

06:02.070 --> 06:04.071
Someday l hope you
and the pile will both go.

06:05.574 --> 06:07.450
And why are you worried about this now?

06:07.743 --> 06:10.619
Well, because college
is no guarantee of a job.

06:10.704 --> 06:12.496
lt's a useless waste of time.

06:12.581 --> 06:15.332
-Where'd you hear that?
-Mom's new boyfriend, Sean.

06:15.417 --> 06:17.960
He makes a lot of money as a club
promoter and he didn't go to college.

06:18.253 --> 06:20.463
And he drives a much nicer car than you.

06:20.714 --> 06:25.092
Any idiot can buy a car and make payments,
but college gave me a career that fulfills me.

06:25.385 --> 06:28.054
-lt's a Ferrari.
-Sure, a Ferrari. A Ferrari?

06:30.640 --> 06:31.766
Look, l've got to get back to my group.

06:31.850 --> 06:35.102
But just keep in mind that, sure,
Sean's club may be hot now,

06:35.187 --> 06:38.105
but in a couple of months, that club will be
gone and so will the Ferrari.

06:38.440 --> 06:41.275
But those people downstairs,
they will still be crazy.

06:47.407 --> 06:49.366
l can't do that again.

06:50.368 --> 06:52.953
-You want to do it again?
-Yeah.

06:56.249 --> 06:57.750
Can't. We ran out.

06:57.876 --> 07:01.796
Oh, damn. You got any Saran Wrap?

07:04.966 --> 07:08.761
l got a Milky Way wrapper.
Still a little caramel in it, though.

07:10.180 --> 07:13.432
You know, there's other stuff we can do.

07:14.142 --> 07:15.434
What do you got in the fridge?

07:17.229 --> 07:18.646
You're awesome.

07:19.981 --> 07:21.774
You're the best kind of friend there is.

07:22.567 --> 07:24.819
No attachments whatsoever.

07:25.654 --> 07:30.116
l promise l will never love you.

07:31.660 --> 07:33.327
Keep talking.

07:33.578 --> 07:37.123
l will never love you forever.

07:41.336 --> 07:43.754
Crap. l got to go pick up Sam.

07:44.214 --> 07:46.257
How long was l wearing that blindfold?

07:47.300 --> 07:49.301
Come on, can't you be 1 5 minutes late?

07:49.386 --> 07:51.804
Nah, l got to go talk to Jen first.

07:51.972 --> 07:55.683
Her latest genius boyfriend is
putting stupid ideas in Sam's head.

07:56.184 --> 07:57.226
What did he say?

07:57.310 --> 07:59.728
He told her that college is a waste of time.

07:59.813 --> 08:02.231
Well, half of what we just did
l learned in college.

08:04.109 --> 08:06.527
l'd like to think l taught you the other half.

08:10.866 --> 08:12.783
Coming, Charlie.

08:13.493 --> 08:14.451
Hi.

08:14.536 --> 08:15.786
How do you always know it's me?

08:15.871 --> 08:17.872
You're the only guy who doesn't have a key.

08:19.291 --> 08:22.042
lt's ironic
because l'm the guy who paid for this place.

08:22.711 --> 08:25.254
Listen, before Sam comes down,
can we talk about Sean for a second?

08:25.338 --> 08:26.589
What's there to talk about?

08:26.673 --> 08:29.383
Dude's smart, funny, classy,
and l like him a lot.

08:30.844 --> 08:34.221
Charlie, this is Sean.
Sean, this is Sam's dad, Charlie.

08:34.514 --> 08:36.891
Awkward moment. Let's do it.

08:36.975 --> 08:38.225
-Good meeting you.
-You, too.

08:38.310 --> 08:39.518
Sorry, l didn't see you sitting there.

08:39.603 --> 08:40.603
lt's all right.

08:40.687 --> 08:43.981
Listen, l was just gonna ask Jen to tell you
that Sam is a really impressionable kid,

08:44.065 --> 08:45.232
so if you could be a little bit careful

08:45.317 --> 08:47.109
about what you say around her,
that would be great.

08:47.194 --> 08:49.403
She seems pretty sharp to me.
What shouldn't l say to her?

08:49.905 --> 08:54.617
l'm sure it was out of context, but she told
me you said college was a waste of time.

08:54.784 --> 08:56.285
Did you say that?

08:56.369 --> 08:58.412
54% of this year's college grads
couldn't find work,

08:58.496 --> 09:01.248
85% of them moved home, so, yeah, l did.

09:02.167 --> 09:04.293
Well, you know what? 1 00% of Sam's mom

09:04.377 --> 09:06.462
doesn't want to have
this conversation right now.

09:07.505 --> 09:11.050
All l'm saying is unemployment,
it's not just for psych majors anymore.

09:11.468 --> 09:13.135
l was a psych major,

09:13.220 --> 09:15.804
but you'd know that most therapists are
had you gone to college.

09:17.224 --> 09:18.933
l'm learning now. Didn't cost me a dime.

09:19.768 --> 09:21.852
Okay, well, l didn't go to college,

09:21.937 --> 09:23.437
but l did go to a lot of frat parties.

09:23.521 --> 09:25.898
And what l learned is when
the guys start fighting,

09:25.982 --> 09:29.151
it's time to pick up your clothes and go.
Sam!

09:29.861 --> 09:31.820
lt's really simple, Sean.
We want Sam to go to college.

09:31.905 --> 09:34.782
lt would have been a really good choice
in 1 962.

09:35.992 --> 09:38.327
Look, it's tough for everybody right now,
but it's gonna turn around.

09:38.411 --> 09:40.204
Why am l going into this with you?

09:40.288 --> 09:42.373
Bottom line, don't say crap like
that around my kid.

09:42.457 --> 09:44.333
Okay? Discussion over. Good to meet you.

09:44.417 --> 09:47.795
You know why it's good to meet me?
Because l'm smart and l'm right. Okay?

09:47.963 --> 09:51.632
My dad steered me away from college
and made me get realistic about life.

09:51.800 --> 09:53.133
You're a club promoter, dude.

09:53.218 --> 09:55.052
You're realistic about glow-sticks and E.

09:55.136 --> 09:57.429
-Charlie.
-Jennifer, l've got this.

09:57.514 --> 09:58.514
Sam!

09:58.598 --> 09:59.723
Not your kid, not your call.

09:59.808 --> 10:01.392
She's definitely your kid.

10:01.810 --> 10:04.770
-What the hell's that supposed to mean?
-All the emotional problems are there.

10:05.480 --> 10:07.690
-Are you kidding me?
-Ready to go, Dad.

10:10.485 --> 10:12.820
l'll have this rewired and get it
right back to you. Let's go, Sam.

10:17.575 --> 10:19.451
-Here you go, Charlie.
-Thanks.

10:20.829 --> 10:22.121
You go to college, Brett?

10:22.289 --> 10:24.999
Yeah, l did.
l was working my way through as a stripper.

10:25.083 --> 10:28.085
And then l started to make so much money
l dropped out of school.

10:29.087 --> 10:31.547
Do you know what?
l should have gotten my degree.

10:31.881 --> 10:33.757
l was not planning on my 40s.

10:36.553 --> 10:39.179
Yeah.

10:41.516 --> 10:43.976
Here comes your ex,
and she doesn't look happy.

10:45.979 --> 10:47.229
-Hey, Jen.
-Hey.

10:47.397 --> 10:49.356
You look great.
l'm gonna just hit the bathroom.

10:49.441 --> 10:51.025
No way. l know where the exits are.

10:52.402 --> 10:53.944
What the hell was that today?

10:54.029 --> 10:56.739
What? l was just defending my kid
like any dad would.

10:57.032 --> 11:00.242
But you're not any dad.
You've got anger problems.

11:00.327 --> 11:02.786
And l had to defend you
like when you played ball.

11:03.163 --> 11:07.541
"Charlie's under a lot of stress. Charlie had
a bad day. Charlie's on steroids."

11:07.625 --> 11:08.625
l never took steroids.

11:08.710 --> 11:11.128
l know.
lf you had, l'd be living in a bigger house.

11:12.297 --> 11:15.507
You're screwing up my relationship
and l want you to go talk to him.

11:15.633 --> 11:17.843
Not gonna happen. And relationship?

11:17.927 --> 11:19.261
You've only dated the guy
for a couple of months.

11:19.346 --> 11:24.558
Yes, but he told me 85% of all relationships
that last past two months go on to marriage

11:24.642 --> 11:27.728
and 54 % last an entire lifetime.

11:28.897 --> 11:30.898
Those are the same percentages
as the college thing.

11:32.233 --> 11:36.320
This guy's only got two numbers.
Why would you date a guy like that?

11:36.529 --> 11:37.654
l like him.

11:37.739 --> 11:39.990
You know, he's good with Sam,
he's got a great sense of humor,

11:40.075 --> 11:41.575
and he's got two Ferraris.

11:41.659 --> 11:43.744
Yeah, l know. Two Ferraris?

11:44.746 --> 11:46.497
One for here, one for the beach house.

11:47.707 --> 11:52.044
Oh, yeah?
Well, l'd have all that if l'd wanted,

11:52.420 --> 11:54.588
but l chose to spend my money on college.

11:55.048 --> 11:57.758
And l can go to the beach if l want to.
l just can't stay there overnight.

12:02.639 --> 12:05.766
Look, l do this for free
because l'm trying to help you.

12:06.017 --> 12:08.936
But l can't help you if you won't admit
that you have issues with your anger.

12:09.020 --> 12:10.938
l'm sorry. l don't consider what l did anger.

12:11.272 --> 12:15.442
Okay, then what should we call it when you
slit that guy's throat while he was sleeping?

12:16.986 --> 12:20.823
l call it frustration.
l was very frustrated that he was alive.

12:21.408 --> 12:22.950
No, no, Ernesto.

12:23.034 --> 12:26.453
Frustration is when you accidentally
cut your finger on a soup can lid.

12:26.788 --> 12:30.207
When you use a soup can lid to
cut off your cellmate's head, that's anger.

12:31.835 --> 12:34.545
Fine, l was angry that he took my soup.

12:36.131 --> 12:38.340
Look, we all feel frustration.

12:38.466 --> 12:40.634
l'm gonna be honest with you
about something that happened to me.

12:41.219 --> 12:42.428
l almost lost it yesterday.

12:42.512 --> 12:45.806
Oh, honey, l remember when l lost it.
lt was a world of pain.

12:48.309 --> 12:50.894
Okay, l'm pretty sure we're talking about
two different things.

12:50.979 --> 12:53.230
What l mean is,
l almost gave into a black rage.

12:53.440 --> 12:55.482
No, we're talking about the same thing.

12:57.193 --> 12:59.695
Give in, baby. Give in.

13:00.738 --> 13:04.741
No, no, what happened was
for the first time in years,

13:04.826 --> 13:09.913
my frustration with someone turned to anger
and l almost lost control.

13:10.165 --> 13:11.165
What did the guy do?

13:11.249 --> 13:12.624
He was talking about my kid.

13:12.709 --> 13:14.877
He crossed the line and l almost
hit him in the head with a lamp.

13:14.961 --> 13:16.753
You were gonna bash in
some guy's head with a lamp

13:16.838 --> 13:18.672
just because he said something?

13:18.798 --> 13:20.716
You're crazy, Charlie.
l no longer respect you.

13:22.802 --> 13:26.054
l'm screwing with you, ese.
l respect you more.

13:27.682 --> 13:30.142
Yeah, that guy had it coming, man.

13:30.518 --> 13:33.896
You'd have been totally justified
beating his face into plowshares.

13:34.856 --> 13:36.315
l think that's in the Bible.

13:36.858 --> 13:39.318
Whoa, whoa, whoa, guys. No, no, no, no.

13:39.402 --> 13:41.778
Anyone who would do that has
got a real problem.

13:41.863 --> 13:45.032
There's no justification for hurting someone
just because they disagree with you.

13:45.450 --> 13:48.118
Anyone who would do that has
impulse control issues

13:48.203 --> 13:50.037
and needs to get into therapy immediately.

13:52.415 --> 13:53.665
l won't be here tomorrow.

13:57.712 --> 14:01.715
And, Wayne, l'm gonna bring you a real
Bible, one that you didn't write yourself.

14:04.719 --> 14:07.262
l don't understand why l can't sleep
with one of your patients.

14:08.806 --> 14:10.182
lt's one thing if you met her in a bar.

14:10.266 --> 14:12.184
lt's another thing if you stalk her
in my house.

14:13.102 --> 14:15.062
l'll wait till she walks to her car.

14:17.232 --> 14:20.067
Stop. l got enough problems of my own.

14:22.278 --> 14:25.656
l got to go back into therapy.
lf l don't, l'm gonna lose it.

14:25.823 --> 14:29.076
Why do you need a therapist?
You are a therapist.

14:30.328 --> 14:32.496
You ever see a tow truck
hauling a tow truck?

14:35.583 --> 14:36.750
So, go.

14:36.918 --> 14:39.336
But there's only one tow truck l trust.

14:39.420 --> 14:41.838
And, unfortunately, l'm having sex with it.

14:44.259 --> 14:47.386
Well, then, ask Kate. She's a therapist.

14:47.929 --> 14:50.097
l'm sure she probably knows somebody.

14:50.431 --> 14:52.558
Oh, my God. You're sleeping with Kate!

14:53.601 --> 14:56.603
Yeah. And she's the best therapist l know.

14:56.813 --> 15:00.107
Problem is she's also my best friend.
And the sex is, l don't know...

15:00.608 --> 15:02.025
-The best?
-Yes.

15:03.152 --> 15:04.611
Why can't you have it all?

15:04.696 --> 15:07.948
l wish. lt's unethical for a therapist to have
sex with a patient.

15:08.449 --> 15:11.034
They teach you that on day one.
lt weeds out half the class.

15:13.121 --> 15:15.831
Look, Charlie,
to me there's only one answer.

15:15.957 --> 15:18.125
You have got to go to her for therapy.

15:18.209 --> 15:20.877
Your mental health is way
more important than the sex.

15:21.254 --> 15:24.339
Of course, without the sex,
she'll probably be lonely.

15:24.716 --> 15:26.341
Please get out of my house.

15:31.264 --> 15:35.601
l don't know what you're here for, but if it's
what l think it is, we only have 1 5 minutes.

15:36.519 --> 15:38.562
Before we start,
l have to tell you about this study l read.

15:38.646 --> 15:40.856
Oh, that sounds so boring.

15:41.232 --> 15:43.650
No, no, no. No, this is good.
This is really good.

15:44.402 --> 15:45.902
You know how having sex with a
patient is the biggest

15:45.987 --> 15:47.946
breach of trust any therapist could commit?

15:48.114 --> 15:49.072
Yeah.

15:49.157 --> 15:52.492
There is a new study that says under
the right conditions that a therapist

15:52.577 --> 15:56.079
and a patient can have both a therapeutic
relationship and a sexual relationship

15:56.164 --> 15:58.582
and keep both completely separate.

15:58.666 --> 16:02.336
Sounds like it was written by a therapist
who was trying to get in somebody's pants.

16:05.340 --> 16:09.092
You're probably right. You are so hot.

16:09.177 --> 16:10.385
l know.

16:11.846 --> 16:13.430
You know what makes you so hot?

16:13.514 --> 16:15.766
Your skin, your eyes, your hair,

16:15.850 --> 16:18.435
your intuitive grasp
of anger management psychology.

16:20.021 --> 16:21.647
That was kind of weird.

16:21.731 --> 16:23.690
l know. l like it weird.

16:25.193 --> 16:26.568
You want to hear something else weird?

16:26.653 --> 16:29.154
l almost hit a guy with a lamp the other day.

16:29.238 --> 16:32.449
You want to hear more about that, huh?
Does that turn you on? Does it, little girl?

16:34.619 --> 16:36.286
Where are we going with this?

16:36.371 --> 16:39.039
l'll tell you where we're going.
We're going to this couch.

16:39.374 --> 16:42.542
Oh, no, no, no. No, better.
You sit in the chair.

16:44.379 --> 16:47.005
Here, maybe take some notes. Lots of notes.

16:47.965 --> 16:51.718
Are you having a stroke?
What the hell is going on?

16:52.136 --> 16:56.139
Come on, just go with it. You can be
the therapist and l'm gonna tell you stuff.

16:56.224 --> 16:58.642
And if you want, you can play
with yourself while l'm doing it.

17:00.645 --> 17:04.564
Okay, let's stop. What is going on here?

17:07.944 --> 17:10.112
l have to get back into therapy.

17:10.196 --> 17:12.989
My anger issues have come up again
and l need your help.

17:13.074 --> 17:14.950
Nope. Go see somebody else.

17:15.034 --> 17:17.369
But you're the only therapist l trust.

17:17.870 --> 17:20.539
But things are going so well
between us right now.

17:20.748 --> 17:23.750
l mean, we feel nothing for each other
and it's working.

17:25.086 --> 17:29.089
lf you come to see me,
sex is out of the question.

17:29.590 --> 17:31.591
But you haven't even read
that study l made up.

17:33.219 --> 17:38.265
Okay, look, if you say you need me,
l could never say no to you.

17:38.808 --> 17:41.351
But l am just talking about therapy, okay?

17:41.436 --> 17:45.105
lf we go this way,
then we are friends with no benefits.

17:45.481 --> 17:48.358
Can't we hang on to some of the benefits?
A COBRA plan, if you will.

17:50.945 --> 17:53.613
Sorry, Charlie, you'll have to put
your cobra back in your pants.

17:55.408 --> 17:56.825
Can l get one last extension?

17:57.326 --> 18:00.454
No, l'm afraid not. Actually, l have some
paperwork for you to fill out.

18:01.789 --> 18:03.498
All right, but you'd better be worth it,

18:03.583 --> 18:06.251
'cause this thing has already turned
into a bureaucratic nightmare.

18:09.172 --> 18:10.464
Coming.

18:12.592 --> 18:13.717
Hi.

18:13.801 --> 18:15.886
Hey, Jen. l just need a minute with Sean.

18:15.970 --> 18:18.138
l got back into therapy
and l want to straighten some things out.

18:18.848 --> 18:21.516
Whoa, Sean.
Got like a camouflage thing going on.

18:24.061 --> 18:27.022
Listen, l shouldn't have lost my temper
like l did.

18:27.273 --> 18:29.316
Anger is an ugly mistress.

18:29.442 --> 18:31.693
Maybe you should stop banging her.

18:31.778 --> 18:33.904
That's good. That's good.
l'm gonna use that in my group.

18:33.988 --> 18:35.322
Oh, good.

18:35.406 --> 18:37.282
Anyway, l am really sorry.

18:37.366 --> 18:40.118
lf you knew the shame and humiliation
this has caused me.

18:40.411 --> 18:42.329
And Sam is smart enough
to make her own decisions.

18:43.414 --> 18:45.749
And l wish you and Jen the very best.

18:45.833 --> 18:47.834
And l hope that maybe even someday
you and l can be friends.

18:48.461 --> 18:49.920
What do you say?

18:50.004 --> 18:51.838
85% chance that'll never happen.

18:57.011 --> 18:58.887
That's okay.
He's still mad, but he'll come around.

18:59.222 --> 19:01.264
l hope not. l just broke up with him.

19:03.017 --> 19:06.186
What? Why'd you let me go through all that?

19:06.270 --> 19:08.855
Because it was painful for you,
which made it fun for me.

19:10.775 --> 19:14.528
Sean's just too opinionated.
Plus he manscapes really weird.

19:16.322 --> 19:19.658
l won't tell you what he does,
but he calls it the Abe Lincoln.

19:27.250 --> 19:30.877
l think you felt like you were
losing control of Sam

19:30.962 --> 19:32.671
because you're only with her half the time.

19:33.172 --> 19:35.632
Of course. The guy was a complete jerk,

19:35.716 --> 19:37.968
but my anger was based in guilt
over my divorce.

19:38.177 --> 19:43.807
Exactly. Sorry, Charlie. l have to kick
you out. But we'll pick this up next week.

19:44.475 --> 19:46.518
Would it be inappropriate
if l gave you a big hug right now?

19:46.602 --> 19:49.437
Yes. lt would be completely inappropriate.

19:49.605 --> 19:53.233
Oh, come on, Kate.
Not the kind of hug you're thinking of.

19:53.818 --> 19:57.654
lt's the kind of hug you'd give your best
friend when she's really helped you out.

19:58.239 --> 20:01.408
Okay. A quick therapeutic one.

20:09.792 --> 20:11.418
Charlie, we can't do this.

20:11.586 --> 20:14.170
l think we can. Don't you want to?

20:14.255 --> 20:18.341
Of course l want to, but it's different now.
l'm inside your head.

20:18.426 --> 20:20.969
l'd feel like l was taking advantage
of a patient.

20:21.262 --> 20:22.762
l'm not a patient. l'm also a therapist.

20:22.847 --> 20:25.223
But you're not my therapist. lt's not equal.

20:26.434 --> 20:27.434
lnteresting.

20:30.104 --> 20:32.272
How does that make you feel?

20:33.190 --> 20:34.316
Conflicted.

20:35.610 --> 20:38.570
You mean the way you felt
about your alternately warm and loving,

20:38.654 --> 20:40.447
yet cold and hypercritical father?

20:41.908 --> 20:43.283
Are you trying to analyze me?

20:43.409 --> 20:47.579
You know you could use it as much as me.
And the code was only created

20:47.663 --> 20:50.665
to protect the patient from a potentially
manipulative therapist.

20:50.750 --> 20:53.919
lt doesn't say one thing about
hot therapist-on-therapist action.

20:55.630 --> 20:58.423
You know what, Doctor?

20:59.300 --> 21:01.718
l think l just had a breakthrough.
Let's do this.

21:03.930 --> 21:09.142
l wasn't expecting this.
But l got these just in case.
