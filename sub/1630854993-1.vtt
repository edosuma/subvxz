02:28.834 --> 02:29.834
Police!

02:29.834 --> 02:30.834
Stop!

02:43.918 --> 02:46.958
Drop it, or die.

02:46.959 --> 02:48.833
OK, OK, I got you.

02:48.834 --> 02:49.501
I got you.

02:49.502 --> 02:52.125
Get your hands on your head.

02:52.126 --> 02:53.708
You good, Jeremy?

02:53.709 --> 02:55.458
Yeah, I'm good.

02:55.459 --> 02:59.750
Lucky for him, you
came when you did.

02:59.751 --> 03:02.792
He's all yours, so
is the paperwork.

03:02.793 --> 03:05.042
Next time, I'll just
let you have the collar.

03:05.043 --> 03:06.583
Life's all about choices.

03:06.584 --> 03:08.958
Hey, you use my
words against me.

03:08.959 --> 03:11.792
Hey, yo, would you
really have shot me?

03:11.793 --> 03:12.917
Always ready.

03:12.918 --> 03:13.543
Always there.

03:13.544 --> 03:14.792
What does that even mean?

03:15.377 --> 03:16.917
Use your imagination.

03:16.918 --> 03:20.083
Hey, yo, would she
really have shot me?

03:20.084 --> 03:22.500
Not my sister's keeper.

03:22.501 --> 03:24.500
You got the right
to shut the hell up.

03:24.501 --> 03:26.292
Now let's get to step up.

03:34.001 --> 03:34.876
Hi, chief.

03:34.877 --> 03:35.958
Hi.

03:35.959 --> 03:38.958
Nice collar on that
carjacker last week, Forest.

03:38.959 --> 03:39.793
Thank you, sir.

03:39.793 --> 03:40.793
You're welcome.

03:42.959 --> 03:46.792
You should have let
me have that collar.

03:46.793 --> 03:47.084
Choices.

03:47.085 --> 03:48.500
Ooh.

03:48.501 --> 03:50.250
So are you going to the bar?

03:50.251 --> 03:52.000
First round's on me.

03:52.001 --> 03:54.833
I think I'm going to
head home, grab a six.

03:54.834 --> 03:56.625
Mm.

03:56.626 --> 03:59.625
Drop it, or die...

03:59.626 --> 04:00.708
what was that?

04:00.709 --> 04:01.958
You like that?

04:01.959 --> 04:02.834
I did.

04:02.834 --> 04:03.251
I liked it.

04:03.252 --> 04:04.292
It's all yours.

04:04.293 --> 04:04.959
OK.

04:04.959 --> 04:05.959
OK.

04:09.668 --> 04:10.543
Ooh.

04:10.544 --> 04:12.000
I think I'm going
to play the number.

04:12.001 --> 04:13.167
Sucker.

04:13.168 --> 04:15.292
Say that when
I'm sipping drinks in Maui.

04:15.293 --> 04:16.667
Hope you take better deodorant.

04:16.668 --> 04:18.583
Ha, she's kidding.

04:18.584 --> 04:21.250
Whatever you say.

04:21.251 --> 04:23.000
Hey, what isle is the deodorant?

04:23.001 --> 04:24.001
First isle.

04:34.168 --> 04:37.083
Mm.

04:37.084 --> 04:41.375
I'm a police officer.

04:41.376 --> 04:43.292
How nice for you.

04:43.293 --> 04:46.167
And what do you do?

04:46.168 --> 04:47.875
I work at the DA's office.

04:47.876 --> 04:52.083
Oh, that kind of makes us,
like, colleagues, right,

04:52.084 --> 04:53.208
co-workers a little bit.

04:53.209 --> 04:53.876
Yeah.

04:53.876 --> 04:54.876
OK.

05:04.376 --> 05:08.042
Give me a pack of lamb skins.

05:08.043 --> 05:09.043
Extra large.

05:16.043 --> 05:17.333
It isn't Christmas.

05:17.334 --> 05:18.417
Check your research.

05:18.418 --> 05:20.375
Jesus was born in August.

05:20.376 --> 05:21.334
We're closed.

05:21.334 --> 05:22.209
I just need to get...

05:22.210 --> 05:23.708
Closed.

05:23.709 --> 05:25.125
OK, wrong store.

05:25.126 --> 05:26.084
Yeah.

05:26.084 --> 05:27.043
Hurry up!

05:27.044 --> 05:29.208
Buckle up!

05:29.209 --> 05:30.875
Hurry the fuck up.

05:30.876 --> 05:31.376
OK.

05:31.376 --> 05:32.251
It isn't my money.

05:32.252 --> 05:33.584
You got that right.

05:40.209 --> 05:41.667
Don't forget the lamb skins.

05:41.668 --> 05:42.750
Want a receipt, too?

05:42.751 --> 05:44.167
Do you want to keep both eyes?

05:44.168 --> 05:45.375
Police!

05:45.376 --> 05:47.083
Drop it, or die.

05:49.043 --> 05:50.043
Oh.

05:50.044 --> 05:51.083
Come on, mother fucker.

06:04.418 --> 06:05.209
Megan?

06:05.209 --> 06:06.209
I'm good.

06:08.959 --> 06:09.959
I'm OK, too.

06:18.834 --> 06:20.333
Drop your weapon now!

06:20.334 --> 06:20.959
Hey!

06:20.959 --> 06:21.334
Hey!

06:21.334 --> 06:21.959
Hey!

06:21.959 --> 06:22.376
Hey!

06:22.376 --> 06:23.209
Just wait.

06:23.209 --> 06:24.209
We're cops!

06:28.376 --> 06:30.375
Oh, my god.

06:30.376 --> 06:32.958
Oh, god.

06:33.376 --> 06:34.251
Oh, oh.

06:34.251 --> 06:35.084
Call 911.

06:35.084 --> 06:35.959
Oh, my god.

06:35.959 --> 06:36.709
Call 911.

06:36.709 --> 06:37.709
Stay there.

06:37.709 --> 06:38.709
You're not going to die.

06:38.709 --> 06:39.334
Stay with me.

06:39.334 --> 06:40.251
Come on.

06:40.251 --> 06:41.251
Oh, god.

06:41.252 --> 06:42.708
I thought he was going to shoot.

06:42.709 --> 06:44.125
Come on.

06:44.126 --> 06:45.001
Come on.

06:45.001 --> 06:45.709
Stay with me.

06:45.710 --> 06:47.125
Stay with me!

06:47.126 --> 06:48.001
Come on.

06:48.001 --> 06:48.376
Come on.

06:48.376 --> 06:49.126
Come on.

06:49.126 --> 06:49.501
Come on.

06:49.501 --> 06:50.251
Push.

06:50.251 --> 06:51.001
You're OK.

06:51.001 --> 06:51.376
You're OK.

06:51.376 --> 06:52.209
You're OK.

06:52.209 --> 06:53.126
I'm so sorry.

06:53.127 --> 06:55.375
Oh, my god.

06:55.376 --> 06:57.000
Oh, my God.

06:57.001 --> 06:58.250
Oh, my God.

07:00.293 --> 07:03.375
I'm Olivia Dahlly, and I'm
running for re-election

07:03.376 --> 07:06.000
as your representative
in Congress.

07:06.001 --> 07:09.500
You know where I
stand on the issues.

07:09.501 --> 07:11.750
Together, we can
make a difference.

07:16.751 --> 07:19.833
Welcome back to the
Justice Jenny Show.

07:19.834 --> 07:23.167
Crime is on the rise
in America, but it

07:23.168 --> 07:28.125
is our Second Amendment rights
that are under assault. I am...

07:28.126 --> 07:29.875
Turn this off, will you?

07:29.876 --> 07:31.417
You don't like what
she has to say?

07:31.418 --> 07:32.458
And stand...

07:32.459 --> 07:34.750
I come here for booze, not news.

07:34.751 --> 07:36.542
I like what she has to say.

07:36.543 --> 07:38.876
I keep a cannon under my bar.

07:43.459 --> 07:45.250
It's kind of early, isn't it?

07:45.251 --> 07:48.375
What did you do, put out an APB?

07:48.376 --> 07:49.542
No.

07:49.543 --> 07:51.792
Found you all by myself.

07:51.793 --> 07:53.875
You should be a detective.

07:53.876 --> 07:56.375
You should check your messages.

07:56.376 --> 07:57.417
I'm busy.

07:57.418 --> 07:58.418
So I see.

08:01.834 --> 08:04.375
It's a nice place.

08:04.376 --> 08:07.083
At least no cops come here.

08:07.084 --> 08:13.333
So Russet says you can come
back to work whenever you want.

08:13.334 --> 08:15.792
She turned your resignation
into a leave of absence.

08:15.793 --> 08:17.958
You're killing my buzz.

08:17.959 --> 08:19.251
I seriously doubt that.

08:21.834 --> 08:26.250
OK, have you... have you spoken
to anyone, a priest or...

08:26.251 --> 08:27.251
A shrink.

08:29.501 --> 08:30.750
I was going to say, your father?

08:30.751 --> 08:36.958
My father... no,
I've not spoken to my father.

08:36.959 --> 08:38.417
Why not?

08:38.418 --> 08:42.250
Because he's a cop, like you.

08:42.251 --> 08:42.918
I'm your partner.

08:42.919 --> 08:45.250
Not any more, you're not.

08:45.251 --> 08:46.833
Then I'm your friend.

08:46.834 --> 08:48.542
Look, either way, I'm
worried about you.

08:48.543 --> 08:50.500
Don't be.

08:50.501 --> 08:53.125
I'm old enough to
take care of myself.

08:53.126 --> 08:53.793
Right, Billy?

08:53.794 --> 08:55.376
Yeah, I myself.

08:58.001 --> 09:02.917
Look, I'm going camping this
weekend with a few friends.

09:02.918 --> 09:05.000
You should tag along.

09:05.001 --> 09:07.292
It'll do you some good to
get you out of the city.

09:07.293 --> 09:09.125
Friends with badges?

09:09.126 --> 09:11.875
Civilians.

09:11.876 --> 09:15.083
He teaches high school,
and she's a social worker.

09:15.084 --> 09:17.292
Kumbaya.

09:17.293 --> 09:18.875
They're good people.

09:18.876 --> 09:21.542
You'd like them if you
just give them a chance.

09:21.543 --> 09:28.001
Call me if you want to go, or
even if you just want to talk.

09:30.334 --> 09:33.293
Hey, I'm still your rabbi.

09:38.543 --> 09:39.959
Don't drink too much.

10:21.418 --> 10:22.293
Hey.

10:22.294 --> 10:23.583
Good morning.

10:23.584 --> 10:25.708
Megan, Blake and Gabriella.

10:25.709 --> 10:27.417
It's nice to finally meet you.

10:27.418 --> 10:28.418
Same here.

10:30.918 --> 10:33.333
Jeremy talks about you all
the time

10:33.334 --> 10:34.334
I bet.

10:37.959 --> 10:40.417
Couldn't have left the
work clothes at home?

10:40.418 --> 10:42.042
Come on.

10:42.043 --> 10:46.542
Hey, once a cop, always a cop.

10:46.543 --> 10:47.626
That's what you think.

10:50.709 --> 10:57.958
All right, say
goodbye to all the bad guys.

10:57.959 --> 10:59.043
I already have.

11:47.626 --> 11:49.500
They've been in there
all night, doing

11:49.501 --> 11:52.750
the devil's work, no doubt.

11:52.751 --> 11:54.126
All right, gather around.

11:59.293 --> 12:00.625
Everyone stay alert.

12:00.626 --> 12:02.583
These are bad hombres.

12:02.584 --> 12:04.042
Barry, you stay here.

12:04.043 --> 12:06.417
If we get in over our
heads, sound the horn.

12:06.418 --> 12:07.583
No smokies.

12:07.584 --> 12:08.750
Right, Preach.

12:08.751 --> 12:10.168
Bow your heads.

12:12.543 --> 12:15.167
Dear Lord, protect us
from evil and give us

12:15.168 --> 12:18.500
strength in our war against
your earthly enemies.

12:18.501 --> 12:19.334
Amen.

12:19.334 --> 12:19.709
Amen.

12:19.710 --> 12:20.750
Amen.

12:20.751 --> 12:22.750
Everybody comes home, got it?

12:22.751 --> 12:23.709
Got it.

12:23.709 --> 12:24.709
Let's roll.

12:36.626 --> 12:38.458
On you, long night.

12:38.459 --> 12:41.042
Well, you going to be
bitching we unload this shit.

12:41.043 --> 12:42.167
I ain't bitching, just tired.

12:42.168 --> 12:44.542
We'll get some sleep when
we're done because we're

12:44.543 --> 12:46.333
going to Philly tonight.

12:46.334 --> 12:47.458
I ain't driving.

12:47.459 --> 12:49.417
Hector can drive.

12:49.418 --> 12:52.333
I like to drive.

12:52.334 --> 12:54.208
All this hard work
is about to pay off.

12:58.293 --> 13:01.500
Baby, are you
coming to bed soon?

13:01.501 --> 13:04.167
How many times I got
to tell you to knock?

13:04.168 --> 13:05.708
We almost smoked your ass.

13:05.709 --> 13:07.792
Are you coming to bed?

13:07.793 --> 13:09.708
Can't you see I'm working here?

13:09.709 --> 13:11.083
You're always working.

13:11.084 --> 13:13.250
Well, that's because
I'm a businessman.

13:13.251 --> 13:15.083
Go back to your
horse, or something.

13:15.084 --> 13:16.583
I'll be in when I'm ready.

13:18.376 --> 13:20.375
That bitch can't get
enough of my stuff.

13:21.002 --> 13:22.625
What are you laughing at?

13:22.626 --> 13:24.826
You're supposed to be standing
guard outside, eagle eye.

13:31.418 --> 13:33.458
Beautiful, isn't it?

13:33.459 --> 13:35.667
I love the mountains.

13:35.668 --> 13:36.792
Those are hills, city girl.

13:36.793 --> 13:39.583
Like you'd know.

13:39.584 --> 13:42.125
Tell her, Blake.

13:42.126 --> 13:44.917
They're mountains.

13:44.918 --> 13:47.375
You teach history,
not geography.

13:47.376 --> 13:50.708
Well, the study of
mountains is orology.

13:50.709 --> 13:51.626
Whatever.

13:51.627 --> 13:52.833
You just made that up.

13:52.834 --> 13:56.251
Hills, mountains...
It's all God's country.

14:09.459 --> 14:11.208
Don't move, chico.

14:11.209 --> 14:14.167
Throw your gun on the ground.

14:14.168 --> 14:15.168
Get down.

14:22.876 --> 14:23.876
Drop it, pigs.

14:37.459 --> 14:38.459
Gun!

14:41.543 --> 14:42.543
Shit!

14:51.876 --> 14:54.458
Eduardo Sanchez?

14:54.459 --> 14:56.292
Sure, why not.

14:56.293 --> 14:58.293
You came to the
wrong county, ese.

15:21.501 --> 15:22.792
Smell that?

15:22.793 --> 15:24.667
Smell that fresh air?

15:26.501 --> 15:29.208
This isn't exactly a
designated campsite.

15:29.209 --> 15:30.875
Oh, you don't get
the full experience

15:30.876 --> 15:32.917
at those designated campsites.

15:32.918 --> 15:35.625
We're going to rough it
out in the wilderness.

15:35.626 --> 15:39.667
What if the wilderness
is private property?

15:39.668 --> 15:41.168
It's Gods country, remember?

15:43.501 --> 15:44.708
Yeah.

15:44.709 --> 15:46.875
Do you think it's safe to leave
your wheels here like this?

15:46.876 --> 15:47.918
I think so.

15:55.043 --> 15:56.875
Cooked right under our noses.

15:56.876 --> 15:58.833
This is worth a
fortune on the streets.

15:58.834 --> 16:00.875
We're not the animals.

16:00.876 --> 16:02.542
We found $80,000 in the house.

16:02.543 --> 16:04.250
You know where to put that.

16:04.251 --> 16:07.458
Wait, where's your warrant?

16:07.459 --> 16:08.875
I don't like warrants.

16:08.876 --> 16:10.292
They leave a paper trail.

16:10.293 --> 16:11.500
Well, now I want a lawyer, man.

16:11.501 --> 16:13.250
That's not how we
do things here.

16:13.251 --> 16:14.458
I know my rights.

16:14.459 --> 16:17.292
See if I care about your rights.

16:17.293 --> 16:20.583
What about this evidence?

16:20.584 --> 16:21.584
Burn it.

16:27.918 --> 16:29.000
Ah.

16:29.001 --> 16:31.042
That was good, Blake.

16:31.043 --> 16:32.833
Gabby, now I see
why you married him.

16:33.544 --> 16:34.958
Thanks.

16:34.959 --> 16:37.542
When are you joining the team?

16:37.543 --> 16:38.792
Me?

16:38.793 --> 16:41.042
Oh, no time soon.

16:41.043 --> 16:42.500
I'm still in my prime.

16:42.501 --> 16:45.417
Who's going to want
you when you aren't?

16:45.418 --> 16:47.584
That's a long way off from now.

16:49.959 --> 16:51.458
What about you, Megan?

16:51.459 --> 16:53.833
My only plan is
to go for a hike.

16:53.834 --> 16:54.709
Want company?

16:54.710 --> 16:56.417
No, thanks.

16:56.418 --> 16:58.417
I'm going to try to
find some of that peace

16:58.418 --> 17:02.083
and solitude I keep
hearing so much about.

17:02.084 --> 17:03.917
Enjoy.

17:03.918 --> 17:06.459
Hey, don't get lost.

17:10.501 --> 17:12.500
Are you sure she's OK?

17:12.501 --> 17:15.667
Got to take the social
worker out of the city.

17:15.668 --> 17:20.958
Yeah, she's good, just
needs a moment to unwind.

17:20.959 --> 17:22.667
I'll talk to her in a few.

17:35.793 --> 17:36.793
Hey, wait up.

17:41.376 --> 17:42.792
Are you tailing me?

17:42.793 --> 17:43.751
No.

17:43.752 --> 17:45.500
Blake and Gabriella
wanted some alone time.

17:45.501 --> 17:46.251
Mm.

17:46.252 --> 17:47.917
I guess I'm some stuck with you.

17:47.918 --> 17:50.543
Ooh, I'm feeling the love.

17:55.751 --> 17:58.667
Thanks for inviting me.

17:58.668 --> 18:00.167
You were right.

18:00.168 --> 18:01.501
I needed to get out.

18:03.668 --> 18:06.542
The job was getting to
me before the shooting,

18:06.543 --> 18:10.083
and the city was
getting to me all along.

18:10.084 --> 18:11.458
Yeah.

18:11.459 --> 18:14.667
They both can do that.

18:14.668 --> 18:20.667
Maybe I should move out here,
get a cabin, or like a teepee.

18:22.168 --> 18:26.542
Somehow, I don't think
that that's a good idea.

18:26.543 --> 18:27.834
I need to do something.

18:30.418 --> 18:35.583
I wish you'd
reconsider resigning.

18:35.584 --> 18:37.833
I miss you in the streets.

18:37.834 --> 18:39.125
And the truth comes out.

18:40.127 --> 18:41.625
Chief.

18:45.084 --> 18:48.708
Just let me go.

18:49.544 --> 18:51.376
Come on, just let me go.

19:09.751 --> 19:11.792
Where are you from, Eduardo?

19:11.793 --> 19:14.917
Colombia, Mexico?

19:14.918 --> 19:15.876
Try the Bronx.

19:15.877 --> 19:17.208
I'm as American as you.

19:17.209 --> 19:20.917
I guess that depends
on your point of view.

19:20.918 --> 19:22.167
This ain't right, man.

19:22.168 --> 19:23.875
Keep digging.

19:23.876 --> 19:26.000
What the hell?

19:26.001 --> 19:30.083
You know, I can't be the only
one cooking meth around here.

19:30.084 --> 19:32.000
Are you working for someone?

19:32.001 --> 19:33.583
Maybe we can do some business.

19:33.584 --> 19:35.750
We don't work for
drug traffickers.

19:35.751 --> 19:38.583
They attract too much
federal attention.

19:38.584 --> 19:41.917
Did you bring your
off-duty weapon?

19:41.918 --> 19:43.792
It's back in the car.

19:43.793 --> 19:47.458
Listen, if you want
me gone, I'm gone.

19:47.459 --> 19:49.083
Just let me go.

19:49.084 --> 19:50.500
Sorry.

19:50.501 --> 19:53.542
Too much went down
this morning, amigo.

19:53.543 --> 19:54.917
What, do you mean them?

19:54.918 --> 19:58.542
Listen, I didn't see anything,
so I can't be a witness.

19:58.543 --> 19:59.750
So just let me go.

19:59.751 --> 20:02.792
Sorry, I can't do
that, Sancho Panza.

20:02.793 --> 20:04.625
All right.

20:04.626 --> 20:07.792
Then dig your own damn grave.

20:07.793 --> 20:10.792
This man just threatened
my life with that shovel?

20:11.501 --> 20:12.501
This is bull...

20:15.959 --> 20:17.208
Hey.

20:17.209 --> 20:18.958
Where the hell did
you two come from?

20:19.794 --> 20:22.083
Barnes!

20:22.084 --> 20:23.084
Double time.

20:31.751 --> 20:32.751
Barnes?

20:36.293 --> 20:38.667
Get those fuckers.

20:38.668 --> 20:40.542
Barry, you help me get
him to the vehicle.

20:40.543 --> 20:41.876
Rest of you know what to do.

20:50.876 --> 20:51.334
This way.

20:51.335 --> 20:52.667
No, no, no.

20:52.668 --> 20:53.168
I don't want to lead
them to the camp.

20:53.168 --> 20:54.168
Come on.

21:08.959 --> 21:09.376
Oh, whoa.

21:09.377 --> 21:10.958
What's going on?

21:10.959 --> 21:11.959
Guys, we need to get the
hell out of here right now.

21:11.959 --> 21:12.501
Were those gunshots?

21:12.502 --> 21:13.750
Leave everything behind.

21:13.751 --> 21:14.209
What are you doing with that?

21:14.209 --> 21:15.084
Go.

21:15.084 --> 21:15.959
Hey, come on!

21:15.959 --> 21:16.543
We can't explain...

21:16.543 --> 21:17.293
Here, you lead the way.

21:17.293 --> 21:18.293
I got the rear.

21:33.584 --> 21:35.083
What do you want
me to tell the ER?

21:35.084 --> 21:35.959
Nothing.

21:35.959 --> 21:36.959
Leave that to me.

21:39.376 --> 21:41.084
I bet he's got a concussion.

21:43.959 --> 21:46.250
We lost them.

21:46.251 --> 21:48.001
There's only one
road out of here.

21:52.876 --> 21:53.209
Down.

21:53.209 --> 21:53.959
Down.

21:53.959 --> 21:54.293
Down.

21:54.293 --> 21:55.001
Down.

21:55.001 --> 21:55.709
Down.

21:55.709 --> 21:56.084
Down.

21:56.084 --> 21:57.084
Down.

22:00.959 --> 22:02.042
What's going on?

22:02.043 --> 22:03.043
Everybody in.

22:10.668 --> 22:13.917
What the hell is going on?

22:13.918 --> 22:16.125
We just witnessed the homicide.

22:16.126 --> 22:17.750
Why did you flag
down those cops?

22:17.751 --> 22:19.001
Because they're the killers.

22:23.876 --> 22:26.125
They're after us because
we saw what they did.

22:26.126 --> 22:27.333
What did they kill?

22:27.334 --> 22:29.584
An unarmed man, with
three other bodies.

22:38.959 --> 22:40.793
Jeremy, Jeremy, Jeremy... dammit.

22:51.293 --> 22:52.626
They're coming your way.

22:59.418 --> 23:00.959
My gun's underneath the seat.

23:09.376 --> 23:11.417
I don't see any extra ammo.

23:11.418 --> 23:13.251
This was supposed to
be a quiet weekend.

23:27.126 --> 23:28.126
Shit, shit, shit!

23:53.001 --> 23:53.501
Come on.

23:53.501 --> 23:54.251
Everybody out!

23:54.252 --> 23:55.375
Everybody out!

23:55.376 --> 23:56.251
Let's go!

23:56.251 --> 23:57.001
Come on!

23:57.001 --> 23:57.376
This way!

23:57.376 --> 23:58.209
This way!

23:58.209 --> 23:59.209
This way!

24:28.209 --> 24:29.209
Damn them to hell.

24:43.751 --> 24:45.083
They're using the
trees for cover.

24:45.084 --> 24:46.792
Do you want to us
to go after them?

24:46.793 --> 24:48.000
They have Barnes's gun.

24:48.001 --> 24:50.167
It's too easy to
ambush us going uphill.

24:50.168 --> 24:51.875
We don't catch them
before nightfall,

24:51.876 --> 24:53.333
we'll never get them.

24:53.334 --> 24:54.792
Call up the reserves.

24:54.793 --> 24:57.083
Tell Barry we need food
and water for an army.

24:57.084 --> 24:58.292
On it.

24:58.293 --> 25:00.918
Hey, Preach, you better come
back here and look at this.

25:10.543 --> 25:11.543
Just what we need.

25:18.251 --> 25:19.792
Did we lose them?

25:19.793 --> 25:21.417
They know I have this gun.

25:21.418 --> 25:24.875
By now, they know I'm a cop.

25:24.876 --> 25:26.375
That's good, right?

25:26.376 --> 25:27.958
It doesn't make a difference.

25:27.959 --> 25:30.417
Look, I know I said, no phones.

25:30.418 --> 25:32.126
But did anybody break the rules?

25:34.418 --> 25:36.333
Really, guys?

25:36.334 --> 25:37.334
What the fuck?

25:39.459 --> 25:40.459
No service.

25:43.376 --> 25:45.625
We just got to talk to
them, make them understand.

25:45.626 --> 25:47.000
Understand what?

25:47.001 --> 25:48.333
We just witnessed
them commit a murder.

25:48.334 --> 25:50.292
They're never going to
let us out of here alive.

25:50.293 --> 25:51.458
You don't know that.

25:51.459 --> 25:52.542
You don't know what
those people did.

25:52.543 --> 25:53.875
They were drug dealers, OK?

25:53.876 --> 25:54.543
It doesn't matter.

25:54.543 --> 25:55.543
They were executed.

25:59.459 --> 26:01.292
What's that?

26:01.293 --> 26:03.292
Fire horn.

26:03.293 --> 26:04.583
Oh.

26:04.584 --> 26:07.000
It's a call to arms.

26:07.001 --> 26:08.542
They're bringing
in reinforcements.

26:08.543 --> 26:10.083
Oh, no.

26:10.084 --> 26:12.417
Look, when there's
enough of them,

26:12.418 --> 26:14.167
they're going to surround us.

26:14.168 --> 26:16.542
We got to try to make
it difficult for them.

26:16.543 --> 26:20.000
Why couldn't you two just
have minded your own business?

26:20.001 --> 26:21.250
Look what you've gotten us into?

26:21.251 --> 26:25.875
We didn't do anything, just
wrong place at the wrong time.

26:25.876 --> 26:27.542
OK, so what can we do?

26:27.543 --> 26:29.167
We're going to split up.

26:29.168 --> 26:30.168
What?

26:30.169 --> 26:31.292
She's right.

26:31.293 --> 26:34.000
We have to split
up into two teams

26:34.001 --> 26:35.917
and head in
different directions.

26:35.918 --> 26:38.167
Then we can double our
chances of getting away.

26:38.168 --> 26:39.292
Wait, wait.

26:39.293 --> 26:40.875
Why two teams?

26:40.876 --> 26:42.625
By your reasoning, we'd
do better splitting up

26:42.626 --> 26:43.584
as four individuals.

26:43.585 --> 26:46.000
Two guns, two teams.

26:46.001 --> 26:47.917
Blake, you go with Meg.

26:47.918 --> 26:50.167
Gabby, you go with me?

26:50.168 --> 26:51.084
No.

26:51.085 --> 26:53.167
You can't expect us
to leave each other.

26:53.168 --> 26:55.708
Have you ever fired a
weapon in your life?

26:55.709 --> 26:57.542
I don't suppose
video games count.

26:57.543 --> 27:00.375
How about you?

27:00.376 --> 27:02.083
There's nothing to debate.

27:02.084 --> 27:06.417
Try to stay parallel to the
road so you don't get lost.

27:06.418 --> 27:10.042
I'm not leaving without you.

27:10.043 --> 27:13.958
Honey, they're right.

27:13.959 --> 27:15.292
This is our best chance, OK?

27:15.293 --> 27:18.458
Look... Look at me.

27:18.459 --> 27:22.083
We need to go right now.

27:22.084 --> 27:25.208
Like I said, thanks for
the invite, partner.

27:25.209 --> 27:28.375
When we get back home,
first round's on me.

27:28.376 --> 27:31.083
You're on.

27:31.084 --> 27:34.459
Hey, be all you can be.

27:39.001 --> 27:41.083
He's been with
City PD for 10 years.

27:41.084 --> 27:44.250
A month ago, his partner shot
and killed a fellow officer.

27:44.251 --> 27:45.375
She's on leave.

27:45.376 --> 27:47.083
Maybe she's the one
that was with him.

27:47.084 --> 27:48.959
Maybe all four of them are cops.

27:57.626 --> 27:59.458
That took longer than
a New York minute.

27:59.459 --> 28:01.042
Not by much, it didn't.

28:01.043 --> 28:02.583
You could be damn sure
we were locked and loaded

28:02.584 --> 28:04.750
inside 60 seconds.

28:04.751 --> 28:06.417
I don't know which
is twat out here.

28:06.418 --> 28:07.458
What's the big emergency?

28:07.459 --> 28:09.417
I'll give you the rundown
when everybody's here.

29:02.668 --> 29:06.833
The Latinos running this farm
were using it as a meth lab.

29:06.834 --> 29:08.458
They opened fire
on me and my men,

29:08.459 --> 29:11.042
and we did what any one
of you would have done.

29:11.043 --> 29:13.083
We don't need the
feds or the media

29:13.084 --> 29:16.042
sticking their noses
in our business.

29:16.043 --> 29:19.333
Unfortunately, we were seen.

29:19.334 --> 29:20.750
Seen by who?

29:20.751 --> 29:23.833
Outsiders, two
men and two women.

29:23.834 --> 29:25.333
One of them is Black.

29:25.334 --> 29:28.083
They're hiding in the
green, and they're armed.

29:28.084 --> 29:30.292
Look what they did
to poor Barnes.

29:30.293 --> 29:32.417
We didn't know if he was
going to pull through.

29:32.418 --> 29:35.667
I don't have to tell you what
will happen if they make it out

29:35.668 --> 29:36.875
of here.

29:36.876 --> 29:39.500
It's not just me and my men
whose necks are on the line

29:39.501 --> 29:40.168
here.

29:40.169 --> 29:42.208
It's our whole way of life.

29:42.209 --> 29:45.542
Either we handle this now, or
we start the damn revolution

29:45.543 --> 29:46.750
when the feds move in.

29:46.751 --> 29:48.708
Revolution sounds good to me.

29:48.709 --> 29:50.458
We're not ready for
that yet, Vernon.

29:50.459 --> 29:52.833
Were supposed to be
preparing the next generation

29:52.834 --> 29:55.250
for a war they can win.

29:55.251 --> 29:57.167
Do you expect us to kill
these people for free?

29:57.168 --> 30:00.417
The council is offering ten
grand in cash for each target.

30:00.418 --> 30:01.043
Shit.

30:01.044 --> 30:02.417
You don't have to pay me.

30:02.418 --> 30:04.625
I'll hunt these
motherfuckers for free.

30:04.626 --> 30:05.750
Shut up, Darcy.

30:05.751 --> 30:07.583
We ain't doing
this shit for free.

30:07.584 --> 30:08.750
Cocksucker.

30:08.751 --> 30:10.500
Blue team will run
this command post.

30:10.501 --> 30:13.292
Block the main road, and
coordinate all activity.

30:13.293 --> 30:16.125
Our Minutemen will be red team.

30:16.126 --> 30:17.625
We're the only team you need.

30:17.626 --> 30:18.875
Yeah, we are.

30:18.876 --> 30:21.250
Our militia will be green team.

30:21.251 --> 30:23.125
We'll get those four for you.

30:23.126 --> 30:24.625
You got that shit right.

30:24.626 --> 30:27.375
Not if we bag them we'll you're
all having a pissing contest.

30:27.376 --> 30:29.417
Our Betsies will
be the orange team.

30:29.418 --> 30:31.500
At least you didn't
make us pink.

30:31.501 --> 30:34.250
I'd never make that
mistake, Annie.

30:34.251 --> 30:35.750
At least I don't
piss standing up.

30:35.751 --> 30:38.250
No, you do it on all fours.

30:38.251 --> 30:39.667
You want to go a few rounds?

30:39.668 --> 30:41.208
I bet you'd like that.

30:41.209 --> 30:42.750
You're playing for
the wrong team.

30:42.751 --> 30:45.125
Save it for the enemy, ladies.

30:45.126 --> 30:47.167
We know these woods
better than any of you.

30:47.168 --> 30:51.167
Oh, I didn't see
you arrive, Cletus.

30:51.168 --> 30:53.167
Because we didn't want
you to know we were here.

30:53.168 --> 30:54.833
Sister fuckers.

30:54.834 --> 30:56.500
What did you say?

30:56.501 --> 30:59.333
Oh, we're just admiring
your outfit, Claudette.

30:59.334 --> 31:01.458
It better be I you're admiring.

31:01.459 --> 31:02.708
Oh, relax.

31:02.709 --> 31:04.792
We know you're
with your brother.

31:04.793 --> 31:05.833
Come again?

31:05.834 --> 31:07.333
Sorry, Cletus.

31:07.334 --> 31:10.167
I meant to say, cousin.

31:10.168 --> 31:11.625
You girls watch yourself.

31:11.626 --> 31:14.167
We want to be shadow team.

31:14.168 --> 31:16.458
That's fine, Wade.

31:16.459 --> 31:20.292
The Wagners will be shadow team.

31:20.293 --> 31:24.417
Our targets are
outnumbered and outgunned.

31:24.418 --> 31:26.875
We have to find
them before dark,

31:26.876 --> 31:28.833
promised my wife I'd
be home for dinner.

31:28.834 --> 31:30.708
Yeah, I told mine
the same thing.

31:33.668 --> 31:35.333
Leave your beer behind.

31:35.334 --> 31:38.333
I don't want you shooting
each other by mistake.

31:38.334 --> 31:42.833
Bring them back warm if you can,
but cold suits me just fine.

31:42.834 --> 31:45.750
Good luck, and good hunting.

31:45.751 --> 31:52.208
Make no mistake, this is war,
maybe not the one we wanted,

31:52.209 --> 31:54.625
but the one that
landed in our backyard.

31:54.626 --> 31:57.750
How do you plan on
explaining all this away?

31:57.751 --> 31:59.333
We won't have to.

31:59.334 --> 32:02.958
These people were never here.

32:02.959 --> 32:05.208
We just have to
cover our tracks.

32:05.209 --> 32:07.542
Sounds like bullshit to me!

32:07.543 --> 32:08.750
Dead or alive!

32:08.751 --> 32:10.208
Dead or alive!

32:10.209 --> 32:11.500
Dead or alive!

32:11.501 --> 32:12.875
Dead or alive!

32:12.876 --> 32:14.625
Dead or alive!

32:14.626 --> 32:16.875
Dead or alive!

32:21.876 --> 32:23.750
They have all the fun.

32:23.751 --> 32:27.375
You forgot to mention one
of our targets is a cop.

32:27.376 --> 32:28.543
I didn't forget anything.

32:43.626 --> 32:46.625
Remember, the Firearms League
is honoring you on Tuesday.

32:46.626 --> 32:49.875
I'm so sick of those
Rust Belt luncheons.

32:49.876 --> 32:51.792
Are you sick of the
press they generate?

32:51.793 --> 32:54.625
Dust off my usual speech.

32:54.626 --> 32:55.626
You got it.

33:00.959 --> 33:02.708
I told you, never
call me on this line

33:02.709 --> 33:04.292
unless it's an emergency.

33:04.293 --> 33:07.625
We have a situation.

33:07.626 --> 33:08.626
Pull over.

33:19.709 --> 33:21.958
Get out.

33:21.959 --> 33:22.751
Excuse me?

33:22.751 --> 33:23.626
You heard me.

33:23.626 --> 33:24.626
Wait on the curb.

33:33.834 --> 33:34.834
Lay it on me.

34:45.668 --> 34:46.668
Down!

34:54.834 --> 34:58.500
We should be out there
waiving our arms.

34:58.501 --> 35:00.418
No one good is looking for us.

35:13.126 --> 35:14.708
Keep it together, Gabby!

35:19.626 --> 35:22.042
You good?

35:22.043 --> 35:23.043
I think so.

35:24.959 --> 35:25.959
Let's go.

35:31.084 --> 35:33.833
Green team to blue command.

35:33.834 --> 35:35.125
Go ahead, green team.

35:35.126 --> 35:38.000
Found their campsite
and a couple of IDs.

35:38.001 --> 35:43.042
We got a high school
teacher and a social worker.

35:43.043 --> 35:45.958
Bunch of damn do-gooders.

35:45.959 --> 35:46.834
Good work.

35:46.835 --> 35:48.917
Torch everything.

35:48.918 --> 35:51.042
One cop, two civilians.

35:51.043 --> 35:52.043
One question mark.

35:58.584 --> 35:59.875
Oh, no.

36:04.084 --> 36:05.084
Keep moving.

36:29.626 --> 36:31.042
What do you see, Caleb?

36:31.043 --> 36:33.542
Two of them up ahead.

36:33.543 --> 36:35.125
That's $20.

36:35.126 --> 36:37.042
5K each.

36:37.043 --> 36:38.083
What am I, your squire?

36:38.084 --> 36:38.959
There's five of us.

36:38.960 --> 36:40.625
That's 4K apiece.

36:40.626 --> 36:43.792
Whatever you say, Mr.
High school graduate.

36:47.876 --> 36:48.958
Come on.

36:48.959 --> 36:49.959
We've got to keep going.

36:52.126 --> 36:54.042
I need rest.

36:54.043 --> 36:57.958
Look, they're gaining on us!

36:57.959 --> 37:00.208
You go on without me.

37:00.209 --> 37:01.667
No deal.

37:01.668 --> 37:02.793
I can't keep this up.

37:07.084 --> 37:09.208
Here, take this.

37:09.209 --> 37:10.292
Take it.

37:12.584 --> 37:15.000
Keep both hands on the gun.

37:15.001 --> 37:16.667
Squeeze the trigger.

37:16.668 --> 37:17.958
Don't pull it.

37:17.959 --> 37:22.083
You only got six shots,
so don't waste any.

37:22.084 --> 37:23.833
Now go.

37:23.834 --> 37:25.125
I told you I can't run anymore.

37:25.126 --> 37:28.958
Then walk fast, but go.

37:28.959 --> 37:29.834
What about you?

37:29.835 --> 37:31.292
I'm going to lead
them away from you.

37:31.293 --> 37:32.583
No.

37:32.584 --> 37:37.542
Look, I'll circle back and catch
up as soon as I can, all right?

37:37.543 --> 37:39.833
Now get going.

37:39.834 --> 37:40.209
Come on.

37:40.209 --> 37:41.209
Go.

37:46.543 --> 37:48.125
Now these two have split up.

37:48.126 --> 37:49.208
Then we'll split up, too.

39:49.126 --> 39:50.126
Stay back!

39:56.251 --> 39:58.250
Put the gun down, miss.

39:58.251 --> 39:59.958
You don't want to hurt anyone.

39:59.959 --> 40:02.833
You surely don't
want to kill us.

40:02.834 --> 40:05.292
It's all a big misunderstanding.

40:05.293 --> 40:08.208
Stay back, you redneck
sons of bitches.

40:08.209 --> 40:10.125
I'll shoot if I have to.

40:10.126 --> 40:12.000
No you won't.

40:12.001 --> 40:13.001
No you won't.

40:16.001 --> 40:17.375
That a girl.

40:17.376 --> 40:20.000
That a girl.

40:20.001 --> 40:21.333
Easy.

40:21.334 --> 40:22.334
Easy now.

40:25.084 --> 40:27.833
Don't you ever point
a gun at someone

40:27.834 --> 40:31.875
unless you intend on using it!

42:20.376 --> 42:22.542
I call dibs on any women.

42:22.543 --> 42:25.083
There's no calling dibs, Darcy.

42:25.084 --> 42:26.833
I fucking call dibs anyway.

42:26.834 --> 42:30.292
Jesus, would you stop
being a pain in my ass?

42:30.293 --> 42:32.958
I'm sick of you given
Darcy a hard time, Coyle.

42:32.959 --> 42:34.250
She's arguing with me.

42:34.251 --> 42:35.500
That isn't how I see it.

42:35.501 --> 42:36.750
Hey!

42:36.751 --> 42:39.500
I thought we're all supposed
to be on the same fucking team!

42:39.501 --> 42:41.876
Yeah, we ain't out here
hunting each other.

42:44.293 --> 42:46.542
It's OK, Mojo.

42:46.543 --> 42:50.542
We're just messing
around, right, Coyle?

42:50.543 --> 42:52.208
Yeah, fine.

42:52.209 --> 42:55.000
Can we please just
go make some money?

42:55.001 --> 42:57.125
Just don't piss me off.

42:57.126 --> 42:58.126
Fine.

43:18.584 --> 43:19.584
Come on!

45:00.459 --> 45:02.167
Martin, Wilcox.

45:02.168 --> 45:04.708
Don't make me shoot
you in the back.

45:04.709 --> 45:05.750
You fucking...

45:32.084 --> 45:35.168
You... you killed them
like they were nothing.

45:38.751 --> 45:40.583
You better be ready
to do the same if you

45:40.584 --> 45:42.043
want to see your wife again.

45:57.668 --> 46:00.833
Ranger, it's Vernon.

46:00.834 --> 46:02.833
Go for me.

46:02.834 --> 46:05.833
Darky killed Bowen,
so Caleb killed him.

46:05.834 --> 46:07.208
We captured a Latina.

46:07.209 --> 46:10.292
Bitch was packing a 38.

46:10.293 --> 46:10.751
Good job.

46:10.752 --> 46:12.333
Bring her in.

46:12.334 --> 46:13.334
Roger that.

46:19.626 --> 46:21.083
We have to go back.

46:21.084 --> 46:24.625
If we do, we'll be
killed, just like Jeremy.

46:24.626 --> 46:26.208
How could you be so cold?

46:26.209 --> 46:28.125
He was your friend, too.

46:28.126 --> 46:29.625
He was more than a friend.

46:29.626 --> 46:32.875
He was my partner, and he
would want us to keep going.

46:32.876 --> 46:35.875
I can't leave Gabriella.

46:35.876 --> 46:38.792
Her only chance is if
we make it out of here

46:38.793 --> 46:40.583
and bring back help.

46:40.584 --> 46:45.292
That could take hours, days.

46:45.293 --> 46:47.501
Do you really believe
she'll still be alive then?

46:52.543 --> 46:53.543
No.

46:56.126 --> 46:57.750
Then I'm going back,
with or without you.

46:57.751 --> 46:59.375
You don't even know
where they are.

46:59.376 --> 47:00.334
I'll find them.

47:00.335 --> 47:02.542
If they don't find you first.

47:02.543 --> 47:03.543
Either way...

47:05.584 --> 47:08.292
Nothing you do is
going to change what's

47:08.293 --> 47:09.584
going to happen to Gabriella.

47:12.584 --> 47:14.543
She wouldn't want you
to die for nothing.

47:32.709 --> 47:33.750
Good luck.

47:33.751 --> 47:34.751
You too.

47:39.834 --> 47:41.708
Dragonfly, it's man.

47:41.709 --> 47:42.833
Wolf man.

47:42.834 --> 47:44.625
I see you finished your blow.

47:44.626 --> 47:45.708
They're all dead.

47:45.709 --> 47:46.833
What?

47:46.834 --> 47:49.292
Your survivors didn't
survive so well.

47:49.293 --> 47:51.792
That makes six
casualties on our side.

47:51.793 --> 47:53.708
We have to get this
bird back to base.

47:53.709 --> 47:56.458
We only promise you one pass.

47:56.459 --> 47:57.293
Affirmative.

47:57.294 --> 47:58.875
Thanks for the assist.

47:58.876 --> 48:00.958
Let God sort them out.

48:00.959 --> 48:02.209
Amen, brother.

49:22.793 --> 49:23.793
On the boulder!

49:27.543 --> 49:28.708
Ma, Cletus!

49:28.709 --> 49:29.875
Leave them be.

49:29.876 --> 49:31.708
Can't do anything for them now.

49:31.709 --> 49:32.750
Blood for blood.

49:48.793 --> 49:50.042
There she goes!

49:50.043 --> 49:50.959
You two, after her.

49:50.959 --> 49:51.876
Come on.

49:51.876 --> 49:52.876
Come on.

50:14.584 --> 50:15.750
There she goes!

50:15.751 --> 50:16.751
Hey!

51:11.959 --> 51:14.917
Hey, Grizzly Adams!

51:53.876 --> 51:54.876
What is it, Annie?

51:57.543 --> 51:58.209
Nothing.

51:58.210 --> 51:59.667
Let's get that bounty.

51:59.668 --> 52:00.084
Hell, yeah.

52:00.084 --> 52:01.084
Let's do it.

52:21.668 --> 52:23.500
Caleb's still in the wild.

52:23.501 --> 52:24.875
Wait outside.

52:24.876 --> 52:25.917
When do we get our money?

52:25.918 --> 52:27.376
When this is over.

52:36.001 --> 52:39.042
Welcome to Eden, Gabriella.

52:39.043 --> 52:41.250
We found your idea at your camp.

52:41.251 --> 52:42.833
You killed Jeremy, didn't you?

52:42.834 --> 52:46.542
Only after he killed
one of our men.

52:46.543 --> 52:48.042
Is my husband alive?

52:48.043 --> 52:49.458
For now.

52:49.459 --> 52:52.167
But you can help us
bring him in safely.

52:52.168 --> 52:54.958
I'm not helping you do shit.

52:54.959 --> 52:56.833
You weren't even
there, were you?

52:56.834 --> 52:59.917
There was another woman that
ran away, but it wasn't you.

52:59.918 --> 53:05.500
The people we shot were
criminals, not embezzlers, not

53:05.501 --> 53:08.208
tax dodgers, real bad guys.

53:08.209 --> 53:09.917
That's none of our business.

53:09.918 --> 53:12.208
Let us go, and I swear we'll
never say a word to anyone.

53:12.209 --> 53:14.750
We both know better.

53:14.751 --> 53:17.542
That's a beautiful cross.

53:17.543 --> 53:18.584
Are you a believer?

53:21.626 --> 53:24.042
Jesus Christ is my Savior.

53:24.043 --> 53:30.292
That makes this more difficult.
We're a Christian community.

53:30.293 --> 53:32.500
Christians don't commit murder.

53:32.501 --> 53:34.208
Who's the other woman?

53:34.209 --> 53:37.625
Tell me her name, and I'll make
this as easy for you as I can.

53:37.626 --> 53:39.167
What difference
does her name make?

53:39.168 --> 53:42.917
I like to know who I'm hunting.

53:42.918 --> 53:43.751
You're police.

53:43.752 --> 53:46.167
You're supposed
to protect people.

53:46.168 --> 53:50.792
We protect our own people.

53:50.793 --> 53:55.083
You're the one that
needs protection now.

54:11.001 --> 54:12.958
Oof.

54:32.543 --> 54:33.833
I've known you most
of your life, Barry.

54:33.834 --> 54:35.542
I brought you into
this department

54:35.543 --> 54:37.167
because you believe
in our cause.

54:37.168 --> 54:40.626
Are you ready to take the next
step into a larger community?

54:43.251 --> 54:44.875
Yes, sir.

54:44.876 --> 54:46.833
Then send this bitch
to a better place.

54:49.168 --> 54:50.250
Preach?

54:50.251 --> 54:52.083
I understand your
hesitation, son.

54:52.084 --> 54:54.375
But it has to be done.

54:54.376 --> 54:55.376
Shoot her in the head.

55:03.709 --> 55:07.083
What are you waiting for?

55:07.084 --> 55:08.375
I'm sorry.

55:08.376 --> 55:10.042
I just never shot anyone before.

55:10.043 --> 55:11.875
That's what our
movement is all about,

55:11.876 --> 55:16.208
shouldering responsibility
others are too weak to bear.

55:16.209 --> 55:18.333
Don't listen to him, Barry.

55:18.334 --> 55:20.708
This has nothing to
do with strength.

55:20.709 --> 55:22.208
He's nothing without you.

55:22.209 --> 55:24.167
She's trying to confuse you.

55:24.168 --> 55:25.625
I'm trying to save you.

55:25.626 --> 55:28.208
Shoot her now.

55:28.209 --> 55:31.167
Make him do his own dirty work.

55:32.418 --> 55:33.834
God forgive me.

55:40.668 --> 55:42.167
Where are you?

55:47.752 --> 55:48.834
Incoming!

55:51.084 --> 55:52.084
Gabriella!

55:54.918 --> 55:55.918
Blake!

55:55.919 --> 55:57.250
Yes!

56:00.251 --> 56:02.250
Let go of me!

56:19.418 --> 56:20.293
No!

56:20.294 --> 56:23.959
Oh, God.

56:40.959 --> 56:41.959
Do it.

56:44.209 --> 56:46.125
I can't.

56:52.209 --> 56:54.251
I hope you get a chance
to redeem yourself.

56:57.126 --> 56:58.126
Grab a shovel.

57:41.126 --> 57:42.709
You just drop that gun.

57:48.751 --> 57:50.043
And the side arms.

57:54.459 --> 57:55.792
Rise and shine.

57:59.459 --> 58:00.459
Now turn around.

58:05.543 --> 58:06.917
I don't know you.

58:06.918 --> 58:09.083
I'm not from around here.

58:09.084 --> 58:10.583
All you need to
know is that there

58:10.584 --> 58:12.833
are people trying to kill me.

58:12.834 --> 58:16.250
But that doesn't tell me
a whole lot now, does it?

58:16.251 --> 58:19.417
What are you doing here?

58:19.418 --> 58:21.417
I witnessed an execution.

58:21.418 --> 58:22.792
Hmm.

58:22.793 --> 58:24.250
That explains the
shooting that I

58:24.251 --> 58:27.250
heard today, thought
it sounded livelier

58:27.251 --> 58:29.792
than the usual tomfoolery.

58:29.793 --> 58:30.793
Get inside.

58:33.126 --> 58:35.250
I would feel safer
with my weapons.

58:35.251 --> 58:38.876
Well, I'd be safer
with them out here.

58:53.251 --> 58:54.458
Their camp was here.

58:54.459 --> 58:58.208
She took out green team here
and is moving in this direction.

58:58.209 --> 58:59.542
Frances is out there.

58:59.543 --> 59:01.125
Frances won't help her.

59:01.126 --> 59:03.125
She'll shoot anyone that
sets foot on our property.

59:03.126 --> 59:04.375
Crazy bitches stick together.

59:04.376 --> 59:07.458
Says the man who was drummed
out of the army on a Section 8.

59:07.459 --> 59:09.125
Oh, you're looking
for a beat down.

59:09.126 --> 59:10.126
Squash this.

59:10.127 --> 59:12.000
I have enough problems
to deal with while you

59:12.001 --> 59:14.417
two nitwits going at it.

59:14.418 --> 59:16.875
Orange team to blue command.

59:16.876 --> 59:18.292
Go for blue command.

59:18.293 --> 59:19.333
Wagners are dead.

59:19.334 --> 59:21.417
She took him out a close range.

59:21.418 --> 59:24.292
I like her style.

59:24.293 --> 59:31.875
So John Preacher killed
some folks today.

59:31.876 --> 59:33.000
My god.

59:33.001 --> 59:37.875
The fools have
finally gone too far.

59:37.876 --> 59:40.167
I need a phone.

59:40.168 --> 59:42.625
The radio I took won't reach
far enough to do me any good.

59:42.626 --> 59:46.208
Yeah, well, you came
to the wrong place.

59:46.209 --> 59:47.250
What about a car?

59:47.251 --> 59:49.333
Oh, I just got a daughter
in town with a car.

59:49.334 --> 59:53.542
But she only checks in
on me every few days.

59:53.543 --> 59:56.167
It's a lovely little
town you got here.

59:56.168 --> 1:00:01.417
Yeah, well, I live here
because I always have,

1:00:01.418 --> 1:00:03.917
not for the company.

1:00:03.918 --> 1:00:07.500
Why is everybody
following this Sheriff?

1:00:07.501 --> 1:00:12.083
Well, I'll tell you.

1:00:12.084 --> 1:00:15.417
You know the Revolutionary War?

1:00:15.418 --> 1:00:19.708
Well, there was a battle that
was fought in these hills.

1:00:19.709 --> 1:00:24.042
A handful of
farmers, Minutemen...

1:00:24.043 --> 1:00:28.708
They held off the red coats
until the militia arrived.

1:00:28.709 --> 1:00:31.042
Now the folks that
live around here...

1:00:31.043 --> 1:00:34.417
Well, they're descendants
of those brave souls.

1:00:34.418 --> 1:00:36.458
So you see, tradition...

1:00:36.459 --> 1:00:38.292
It's important to us.

1:00:38.293 --> 1:00:41.417
It's in our blood.

1:00:41.418 --> 1:00:43.417
That tradition include murder?

1:00:43.418 --> 1:00:45.167
Oh, those Billy Bobs...

1:00:45.168 --> 1:00:48.167
They're prepping for a
war against the government

1:00:48.168 --> 1:00:51.167
that they can't possibly win.

1:00:51.168 --> 1:00:53.167
I mean, mostly it's
just a show so they

1:00:53.168 --> 1:00:55.625
can play with their damn guns.

1:00:55.626 --> 1:00:58.042
They got a bunker not
very far from here,

1:00:58.043 --> 1:01:01.417
some kind of a training camp.

1:01:01.418 --> 1:01:07.250
I wonder if there might not be
some kind of a radio set there

1:01:07.251 --> 1:01:10.667
that you could use
to call for help.

1:01:21.084 --> 1:01:25.084
Stay still if you
want to stay alive.

1:01:47.126 --> 1:01:50.000
What are you boys
doing on my property?

1:01:50.001 --> 1:01:51.500
Now, hold on, Frances.

1:01:51.501 --> 1:01:53.042
We don't want any trouble.

1:01:53.043 --> 1:01:55.417
Well, get in your vehicle,
and there won't be any.

1:01:55.418 --> 1:01:56.542
We're looking for a woman.

1:01:56.543 --> 1:01:58.125
Try a whorehouse.

1:01:58.126 --> 1:01:59.792
This one's dangerous.

1:01:59.793 --> 1:02:01.417
And I'm not?

1:02:01.418 --> 1:02:02.418
She's armed.

1:02:02.419 --> 1:02:03.625
You don't say.

1:02:03.626 --> 1:02:05.042
We have to look inside.

1:02:05.043 --> 1:02:07.208
You do, and I'll shoot you.

1:02:07.209 --> 1:02:10.417
Nobody comes inside
without an invitation.

1:02:10.418 --> 1:02:13.667
And I'm not feeling very
hospitable right now.

1:02:13.668 --> 1:02:15.667
This is a matter
of law, Frances.

1:02:15.668 --> 1:02:18.417
Who's law, yours or mine?

1:02:18.418 --> 1:02:19.458
There's only one law.

1:02:19.459 --> 1:02:23.708
On my land, that's me.

1:02:23.709 --> 1:02:26.167
Is she here or not?

1:02:26.168 --> 1:02:30.667
You missed her by
20, maybe 30 minutes.

1:02:30.668 --> 1:02:34.458
She asked for directions to the
highway, so I gave them to her.

1:02:34.459 --> 1:02:35.583
Did she give you her name?

1:02:35.584 --> 1:02:38.333
No, she didn't mention that.

1:02:38.334 --> 1:02:41.833
She did say that you idiots
killed some folks today.

1:02:41.834 --> 1:02:43.583
She killed some herself...

1:02:43.584 --> 1:02:44.708
Good men.

1:02:44.709 --> 1:02:47.208
There hasn't been a good man

1:02:47.209 --> 1:02:51.667
around here since my husband
died, God rest his soul.

1:02:51.668 --> 1:02:53.500
Have a blessed day, Frances.

1:02:53.501 --> 1:02:56.292
Keep your door locked
until this is over.

1:02:56.293 --> 1:03:03.626
Hey, you go looking for judgment
day, you may just find it.

1:03:18.543 --> 1:03:22.375
Go uphill for about a mile
till you come to a side road.

1:03:22.376 --> 1:03:26.125
That'll take you to the
bunker that I told you about.

1:03:26.126 --> 1:03:28.292
If I had had my
weapons just now,

1:03:28.293 --> 1:03:29.542
I could have finished this.

1:03:29.543 --> 1:03:33.083
Well, first of all, I
just saved your life.

1:03:33.084 --> 1:03:35.375
And second, you're welcome.

1:03:35.376 --> 1:03:37.750
Now get the hell out of
here before somebody else

1:03:37.751 --> 1:03:41.875
gets killed, namely me.

1:03:41.876 --> 1:03:42.876
Thank you.

1:03:45.501 --> 1:03:51.251
Hey, if they pin you
down, give them hell.

1:04:04.751 --> 1:04:06.667
Why aren't you back
at the station?

1:04:06.668 --> 1:04:09.417
Walter said that you needed
this force woman's jacket right

1:04:09.418 --> 1:04:13.167
away, so I ran it over myself.

1:04:13.168 --> 1:04:14.458
That's her.

1:04:14.459 --> 1:04:18.167
Her father was Buffalo
PD Brass, and her brother

1:04:18.168 --> 1:04:19.333
carried a gold shield.

1:04:19.334 --> 1:04:21.583
She's only been on
the job for two years.

1:04:21.584 --> 1:04:22.833
A bitch and a rookie.

1:04:22.834 --> 1:04:24.333
Nice language.

1:04:24.334 --> 1:04:25.750
You can go now, Kayleigh.

1:04:25.751 --> 1:04:28.542
Guess I'll go file my nails.

1:04:28.543 --> 1:04:30.167
She served in the
National Guard,

1:04:30.168 --> 1:04:32.542
and spent two years
in Alibaba land.

1:04:32.543 --> 1:04:33.583
Combat?

1:04:33.584 --> 1:04:34.584
Motor pool.

1:04:34.585 --> 1:04:37.417
She trained for a war
she never got to fight.

1:04:37.418 --> 1:04:38.418
So did we.

1:05:22.751 --> 1:05:23.626
Hello?

1:05:23.626 --> 1:05:24.626
Hello?

1:05:28.876 --> 1:05:29.876
Fuck.

1:05:41.501 --> 1:05:44.292
Whatever you're
thinking, forget it.

1:05:44.293 --> 1:05:46.543
Drop your hardware,
and raise your hands.

1:05:52.876 --> 1:05:54.626
Nice and slow, darling.

1:05:58.376 --> 1:06:02.750
Step forward so you're not
tempted to do anything stupid.

1:06:02.751 --> 1:06:06.833
We can take you back with
your face or without it.

1:06:06.834 --> 1:06:09.583
Thought most of you yahoos
around here were men.

1:06:09.584 --> 1:06:10.708
Freedom fighters.

1:06:10.709 --> 1:06:11.958
Domestic terrorists.

1:06:11.959 --> 1:06:14.333
Annie, I'm tired of her mouth.

1:06:14.334 --> 1:06:15.708
I like her mouth.

1:06:16.377 --> 1:06:18.708
It isn't smart to antagonize us.

1:06:18.709 --> 1:06:20.292
Cuff her, Jo.

1:06:20.293 --> 1:06:22.917
With pleasure.

1:06:22.918 --> 1:06:24.958
You don't have to do this.

1:06:24.959 --> 1:06:27.708
You could walk away or help me.

1:06:27.709 --> 1:06:30.833
In the name of sisterhood,
we've got 10,000 reasons

1:06:30.834 --> 1:06:32.917
not to roll over for you.

1:06:32.918 --> 1:06:34.417
A bounty.

1:06:34.418 --> 1:06:37.083
3,300 apiece, not bad
for an afternoon's work.

1:06:37.084 --> 1:06:38.709
We didn't even have
to fire a shot.

1:06:44.418 --> 1:06:45.418
Fire!

1:07:35.793 --> 1:07:38.000
Hey, good looking.

1:07:38.001 --> 1:07:39.792
Why did you 86 them?

1:07:39.793 --> 1:07:41.375
You're on the same team.

1:07:41.376 --> 1:07:44.042
You capped those broads, not me.

1:07:44.043 --> 1:07:47.792
Now I kill you, collect $10,000.

1:07:47.793 --> 1:07:50.542
I've already got 10 coming to me
for killing your Black friend.

1:07:50.543 --> 1:07:51.793
What about my other friends?

1:07:54.918 --> 1:07:56.501
You're the last of the Mohicans.

1:08:07.959 --> 1:08:10.668
It was boring around
here until you showed up.

1:08:16.418 --> 1:08:17.834
Pick it up if you want to dance.

1:08:45.168 --> 1:08:47.500
Ooh, fight back.

1:08:47.501 --> 1:08:48.501
I like rough.

1:08:55.710 --> 1:08:56.875
Ah.

1:08:56.876 --> 1:08:57.876
Ah.

1:09:21.043 --> 1:09:22.418
Body shots, huh?

1:10:21.918 --> 1:10:22.918
You fucking bitch!

1:10:47.668 --> 1:10:48.834
Orange team, come in.

1:10:51.959 --> 1:10:53.000
Preacher for orange team.

1:10:53.001 --> 1:10:54.001
Come in.

1:10:57.168 --> 1:10:59.292
Go for orange.

1:10:59.293 --> 1:11:01.667
What's your 20?

1:11:01.668 --> 1:11:04.208
I'm at some old training camp.

1:11:04.209 --> 1:11:05.583
Annie?

1:11:05.584 --> 1:11:07.708
Annie's dead, so are
the rest of them.

1:11:07.709 --> 1:11:10.958
Some asshole with long hair
got them before I got him.

1:11:10.959 --> 1:11:12.708
Caleb.

1:11:12.709 --> 1:11:14.125
Turn yourself in, Megan.

1:11:14.126 --> 1:11:16.083
There's no escaping.

1:11:19.209 --> 1:11:22.292
I don't want to
escape, Preacher.

1:11:22.293 --> 1:11:23.667
You started this.

1:11:23.668 --> 1:11:25.708
I'm going to finish it.

1:11:25.709 --> 1:11:28.208
I'm going to finish you.

1:11:28.209 --> 1:11:32.250
You triggered the
wrong bitch today.

1:11:32.251 --> 1:11:33.251
Out.

1:11:35.751 --> 1:11:36.833
Hello?

1:11:36.834 --> 1:11:38.208
Hello?

1:11:38.209 --> 1:11:39.293
Son of a whore.

1:11:42.126 --> 1:11:44.167
Vernon, don't go to that camp.

1:11:44.168 --> 1:11:45.833
It's a trap.

1:11:45.834 --> 1:11:47.708
There's a debt to be paid
for Caleb, and I..

1:11:47.709 --> 1:11:49.375
I'm in charge of this operation!

1:11:49.376 --> 1:11:50.875
I order you to stay put!

1:11:50.876 --> 1:11:53.625
And I thought you was
about personal freedom.

1:11:53.626 --> 1:11:54.708
Come on, boys.

1:11:54.709 --> 1:11:56.626
Let's go break out the big gun.

1:11:59.959 --> 1:12:02.250
What now, Preach?

1:12:02.251 --> 1:12:03.750
Circle the wagons.

1:12:03.751 --> 1:12:07.250
Pull all of our other
people off the roadblocks.

1:12:07.251 --> 1:12:12.751
Mom, Dad, I got myself
into a real jam.

1:12:16.793 --> 1:12:18.126
And I couldn't save my friends.

1:12:22.001 --> 1:12:23.001
I wish I could.

1:12:25.626 --> 1:12:27.333
I'm going to take a
record of everything that

1:12:27.334 --> 1:12:28.626
goes down today.

1:12:30.876 --> 1:12:37.625
Before that, I want you to
know how much I love you

1:12:37.626 --> 1:12:39.626
and how much I wish I
could see you again.

1:12:48.376 --> 1:12:49.376
I...

1:12:53.293 --> 1:12:56.833
I'm sorry.

1:12:56.834 --> 1:12:59.958
I'm sorry I couldn't save them.

1:12:59.959 --> 1:13:01.875
I'm sorry.

1:13:01.876 --> 1:13:04.250
I just wanted to
be good for you.

1:13:04.251 --> 1:13:05.959
I just wanted to make you proud.

1:13:09.709 --> 1:13:12.833
But I'm going to
make things right.

1:13:12.834 --> 1:13:14.417
If it's the last
thing I would do,

1:13:14.418 --> 1:13:17.250
I'm going to make things right.

1:13:37.376 --> 1:13:38.500
Padlocks off the door.

1:13:38.501 --> 1:13:39.834
She broke in there.

1:14:20.043 --> 1:14:20.751
Take over.

1:14:20.751 --> 1:14:21.751
Keep your finger
off the trigger.

1:14:21.752 --> 1:14:25.875
I don't want you
perforating me prematurely.

1:14:25.876 --> 1:14:26.876
I ain't no idiot.

1:16:10.459 --> 1:16:12.208
Let's go!

1:16:12.209 --> 1:16:12.876
Hurry up!

1:16:12.877 --> 1:16:14.292
Let's go!

1:16:14.293 --> 1:16:15.875
Come on!

1:16:15.876 --> 1:16:16.876
Let's go!

1:16:22.209 --> 1:16:23.292
No screwing around.

1:16:23.293 --> 1:16:24.417
We take this bitch out.

1:16:24.418 --> 1:16:25.958
We go home.

1:16:25.959 --> 1:16:27.917
Everyone goes home.

1:16:27.918 --> 1:16:28.959
Let's do it.

1:18:00.459 --> 1:18:01.708
Get the hell out of here!

1:18:01.709 --> 1:18:03.333
Do you want to get
shot in the back?

1:18:06.709 --> 1:18:08.667
She's out of ammo.

1:18:08.668 --> 1:18:10.043
I wouldn't count on that.

1:18:35.459 --> 1:18:37.042
Oh, good god.

1:18:37.043 --> 1:18:39.042
Here comes the crazy train.

1:18:39.043 --> 1:18:40.583
Well, who's that?

1:18:40.584 --> 1:18:42.542
She who must not be named.

1:18:46.418 --> 1:18:47.459
Park it somewhere safe.

1:18:55.459 --> 1:18:56.667
Congresswoman Dahlly.

1:18:56.668 --> 1:18:58.000
Get out.

1:18:58.001 --> 1:18:58.626
Welcome home.

1:18:58.627 --> 1:19:00.042
Mm.

1:19:00.043 --> 1:19:01.792
There is no way I was
going to miss this.

1:19:01.793 --> 1:19:03.792
Only the female cop is left.

1:19:03.793 --> 1:19:05.250
We lost a lot of people today.

1:19:05.251 --> 1:19:08.417
You just tell me where
to find the bitch.

1:19:26.668 --> 1:19:30.125
Red team, come in.

1:19:30.126 --> 1:19:31.418
Vernon, are you out there?

1:19:33.751 --> 1:19:37.292
How about my strike team?

1:19:37.293 --> 1:19:40.083
Damn it.

1:19:40.084 --> 1:19:41.500
I think it's time
we packed it in.

1:19:41.501 --> 1:19:42.667
Have you lost your mind?

1:19:42.668 --> 1:19:44.167
I think we all have.

1:19:44.168 --> 1:19:45.708
Are you going to spend
the rest of your life

1:19:45.709 --> 1:19:47.542
in prison over one woman?

1:19:47.543 --> 1:19:49.333
Beats being dead.

1:19:49.334 --> 1:19:50.750
What will the council say?

1:19:50.751 --> 1:19:52.208
Think about your family.

1:19:52.209 --> 1:19:53.792
I am thinking about them.

1:19:53.793 --> 1:19:56.208
Pick up, Preacher.

1:19:56.209 --> 1:19:58.084
Are you going to
get that, or am I?

1:20:00.501 --> 1:20:02.500
Go for me.

1:20:02.501 --> 1:20:05.500
I handled red team and
the other deputies.

1:20:05.501 --> 1:20:08.208
The rest of you are under
arrest for murder and accessory.

1:20:08.209 --> 1:20:10.708
You've got 30 seconds
to lay down your arms.

1:20:10.709 --> 1:20:12.208
You're out of your jurisdiction.

1:20:12.209 --> 1:20:14.667
You're not even on active duty.

1:20:14.668 --> 1:20:16.167
Call it a citizen's arrest.

1:20:16.168 --> 1:20:18.750
How many people
did you kill today?

1:20:18.751 --> 1:20:21.417
Ask me again when I see you.

1:20:21.418 --> 1:20:21.918
I'm done.

1:20:21.919 --> 1:20:23.167
Screw my pension.

1:20:23.168 --> 1:20:26.083
You want to leave, be my guest.

1:20:26.084 --> 1:20:28.458
Time's up.

1:20:29.044 --> 1:20:32.583
We're in the shit now.

1:20:32.584 --> 1:20:33.750
I didn't sign up for this.

1:20:33.751 --> 1:20:36.375
Well, man the fuck up.

1:20:36.376 --> 1:20:39.375
Yes, ma'am.

1:20:42.668 --> 1:20:43.626
Shit.

1:20:43.626 --> 1:20:44.626
Ah.

1:20:55.251 --> 1:20:56.625
We're going to
need a bigger gun.

1:21:04.584 --> 1:21:05.875
Walter!

1:21:15.459 --> 1:21:16.459
Hey!

1:21:29.876 --> 1:21:31.209
Hallelujah.

1:23:01.876 --> 1:23:02.876
Preacher!

1:23:06.043 --> 1:23:07.543
Drop your weapons now!

1:23:47.709 --> 1:23:49.083
Recognize this?

1:23:49.084 --> 1:23:53.333
Please, I have a wife, a son.

1:23:53.334 --> 1:23:54.875
My friends had families, too.

1:23:54.876 --> 1:23:55.958
Jesus.

1:23:55.959 --> 1:23:59.083
I don't even know if Blake
and Gabriella had kids.

1:23:59.084 --> 1:24:00.917
I had a brother and
a brother-in-law

1:24:00.918 --> 1:24:02.625
until about two minutes ago.

1:24:02.626 --> 1:24:04.917
You have a knack
for killing lawmen.

1:24:04.918 --> 1:24:07.042
What do you know about the law?

1:24:07.043 --> 1:24:09.500
I know how little
a street cop makes.

1:24:09.501 --> 1:24:12.000
I have $80,000 from
those traffickers.

1:24:12.001 --> 1:24:13.792
It's yours if you let me go.

1:24:13.793 --> 1:24:16.417
Give it to those
families if you want to.

1:24:16.418 --> 1:24:18.625
Get on your feet.

1:24:18.626 --> 1:24:19.626
Up.

1:24:24.793 --> 1:24:26.333
Where is it?

1:24:26.334 --> 1:24:27.375
Do we have a deal?

1:24:27.376 --> 1:24:29.333
Show me the money first.

1:24:29.334 --> 1:24:30.958
You have me at a disadvantage.

1:24:30.959 --> 1:24:32.333
You got that right.

1:24:32.334 --> 1:24:34.293
Speak now or forever
hold your peace.

1:24:37.501 --> 1:24:39.792
It's in the glove compartment.

1:24:39.793 --> 1:24:40.793
Keys.

1:24:48.501 --> 1:24:51.751
You are a disgrace
to that uniform.

1:24:54.376 --> 1:24:57.668
Take it off now!

1:25:03.418 --> 1:25:04.834
Take it all off.

1:25:13.084 --> 1:25:15.418
Eighty grand.

1:25:16.751 --> 1:25:18.668
Was it worth it?

1:25:19.043 --> 1:25:20.834
Takes money to build an army.

1:25:23.543 --> 1:25:26.083
Did Gabriella beg for her life?

1:25:26.084 --> 1:25:29.958
How about Blake, hmm?

1:25:29.959 --> 1:25:32.542
Mistakes were made.

1:25:32.543 --> 1:25:34.000
I'll give you that.

1:25:34.001 --> 1:25:36.958
But if you pull that trigger
and shoot me in cold blood...

1:25:36.959 --> 1:25:38.583
I'll be no better than you?

1:25:38.584 --> 1:25:40.667
You already pushed
me over that line.

1:25:40.668 --> 1:25:42.917
- You wanted to be pushed.
- You think you know me?

1:25:42.918 --> 1:25:45.000
You only became a cop
because of your daddy,

1:25:45.001 --> 1:25:46.542
but you couldn't
handle the shit.

1:25:46.543 --> 1:25:48.708
Now you're trying to prove
you have what it takes.

1:25:48.709 --> 1:25:51.750
You murdered my friends.

1:25:51.751 --> 1:25:53.833
If you were going to kill me,

1:25:53.834 --> 1:25:55.918
you would have pulled
that trigger already.

1:26:05.584 --> 1:26:07.917
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1:26:08.209 --> 1:26:09.209
No!

1:26:15.001 --> 1:26:16.751
I don't want to put you down.

1:26:19.168 --> 1:26:20.625
I want to put you away.

1:26:20.626 --> 1:26:21.917
Get your hands on your head.

1:26:21.918 --> 1:26:22.918
I'm taking you in.

1:26:25.918 --> 1:26:29.792
You have no idea what you're
getting yourself into.

1:26:29.793 --> 1:26:31.542
I think I do.

1:26:31.543 --> 1:26:33.500
You guys aren't all
that hard to figure out.

1:26:33.501 --> 1:26:36.084
We just might surprise you.

1:26:37.209 --> 1:26:40.418
FBI is going to love your ass,

1:26:42.043 --> 1:26:44.876
so is gen pop.

1:26:46.876 --> 1:26:50.001
You don't want my
friends for enemies.

1:26:55.501 --> 1:26:57.792
They don't want me for an enemy.

1:26:57.793 --> 1:26:59.959
You just assassinated
a Congresswoman.

1:27:00.209 --> 1:27:02.793
I'm probably going to get
a book deal on a TV show.

1:27:05.668 --> 1:27:06.751
You know what to do.

1:27:15.959 --> 1:27:16.959
Tighter.

1:27:19.793 --> 1:27:22.792
We have chapters all
over the country.

1:27:22.793 --> 1:27:24.793
They'll find you, no
matter where you hide.

1:27:29.251 --> 1:27:32.000
I'm not hiding.

1:27:32.001 --> 1:27:33.583
That a girl.

1:27:33.584 --> 1:27:36.125
Daddy would be proud.

1:27:41.209 --> 1:27:42.250
What is that?

1:27:43.668 --> 1:27:44.833
What the fuck is that?

1:27:48.543 --> 1:27:50.958
We were just the
first responders.

1:27:50.959 --> 1:27:53.833
Do you realize how many men
there are in this county,

1:27:53.834 --> 1:27:55.208
how many guns?

1:27:55.209 --> 1:27:57.958
Well, it's a good thing
I have you with me.

1:27:57.959 --> 1:28:01.583
Too bad you just killed
my hostage negotiator.

1:28:01.584 --> 1:28:03.750
There won't be any negotiating.

1:28:03.751 --> 1:28:06.333
You'll never get
out of here alive.

1:28:06.334 --> 1:28:08.042
And neither will you.

1:28:08.043 --> 1:28:09.917
We'll see.

1:28:09.918 --> 1:28:10.918
Get moving.

1:28:43.959 --> 1:28:46.667
[MUSIC - ARMAND JOHN
PETRI AND JOE ROZLER,

1:28:54.626 --> 1:28:56.126
The wind is full of lies.

1:28:58.918 --> 1:29:04.833
A flying bullet
cries and searches

1:29:04.834 --> 1:29:10.709
for the mark to kill and
cool a burning flame.

1:29:13.126 --> 1:29:15.126
Will I ever be the same?

1:29:23.084 --> 1:29:24.793
A carnival of fools.

1:29:27.709 --> 1:29:32.292
The master steals the jewels.

1:29:32.293 --> 1:29:38.251
Hiding from the flame that
goes beyond another name.

1:29:41.709 --> 1:29:48.793
The wind is blowing cold,
telling stories never told.

1:29:50.959 --> 1:29:55.083
I'm screaming for
the final life.

1:29:55.084 --> 1:29:57.709
Who will take the blame?

1:30:00.126 --> 1:30:02.209
Will I ever be the same?

1:30:38.293 --> 1:30:42.833
The wind is full of lies.

1:30:42.834 --> 1:30:50.833
The final bullet flies,
searching for another life,

1:30:50.834 --> 1:30:56.542
a sole, a prize to claim.

1:30:56.543 --> 1:30:59.126
Will I ever be the same?

1:31:06.751 --> 1:31:12.793
Searching for the truth to
tell, when will I decide?

1:31:16.001 --> 1:31:21.001
I can never cry and hide.
