00:10.510 --> 00:13.930
<i>Hi, guys. It's finally prom!</i>

00:14.014 --> 00:18.018
<i>We are getting glammed up</i>
<i>and SPANXed up for our big night!</i>

00:18.601 --> 00:22.022
<i>Oh. You can't wear three pairs, Soph.</i>
<i>You won't be able to breathe.</i>

00:22.105 --> 00:23.064
<i>I'm good.</i>

00:52.886 --> 00:54.971
I love you so much.

00:55.680 --> 00:56.890
I love you too.

01:00.894 --> 01:02.270
You are not my friend.

01:13.114 --> 01:17.077
-Okay. Time to stop moping around.
-Get out of bed, or you're grounded.

01:18.244 --> 01:21.331
-I'm sorry I've been so horrible.
-There's my girl.

01:25.085 --> 01:26.336
We forgive you.

01:26.920 --> 01:29.714
Now, if we can forgive you,
you can forgive Gia.

01:30.298 --> 01:32.926
High school's almost over.
Enough of this petty bullshit.

01:33.009 --> 01:36.554
Rebuild your friendship,
like I'm rebuilding my credit score.

01:37.097 --> 01:38.098
Sorry.

01:38.932 --> 01:40.642
How'd you know we were in a fight?

01:40.725 --> 01:41.935
Gia texted us.

01:42.018 --> 01:43.478
Said the two of you had a falling out

01:43.561 --> 01:45.438
and warned us she wouldn't be around
for a while.

01:45.522 --> 01:47.524
Yeah, text your BFF.

01:47.607 --> 01:48.566
Mm-hm.

01:53.822 --> 01:56.241
Oh, <i>The Sixth Sense.</i> Love it.

01:56.324 --> 01:59.077
-I knew he was a ghost the whole time.
-What?

01:59.160 --> 02:02.747
Yeah. I mean, the kid sees dead people?
Only <i>he </i>sees Bruce Willis?

02:02.831 --> 02:05.416
-You do the math.
-You just told me he was the ghost.

02:05.500 --> 02:09.170
He didn't know he was a ghost,
and neither did the audience. Except me.

02:09.254 --> 02:10.088
I knew.

02:10.588 --> 02:13.299
Well, I am not as perceptive as you are.

02:13.383 --> 02:14.676
No one is.

02:14.759 --> 02:16.719
-I really need to talk to Gia.
-You do.

02:16.803 --> 02:19.973
I mean, you've never gone a day,
let alone a whole month, without talking.

02:20.056 --> 02:21.057
A month?

02:21.975 --> 02:24.644
Wait. When did Gia text you
that we were in a fight?

02:24.727 --> 02:26.813
-After the party.
-Which party?

02:26.896 --> 02:29.107
When you woke up the next day
looking like death.

02:29.190 --> 02:32.944
That was after Jake W's party.
So you haven't seen Gia here for a month?

02:35.530 --> 02:37.490
-Watch where you're going!

02:37.574 --> 02:38.533
That asshole!

02:41.327 --> 02:42.453
They know.

02:45.540 --> 02:46.541
Dick.

02:46.624 --> 02:49.085
I realized, once I do this,
I'm never gonna see you again.

02:49.169 --> 02:51.546
And I cannot leave this earth
without telling you how much I--

02:55.091 --> 02:56.301
I gotta find Gia!

03:01.097 --> 03:03.099
Oh my God. Gavin knows Gia's dead?

03:04.893 --> 03:06.436
-Gia?
-<i>Don't tell them anything.</i>

03:06.519 --> 03:08.771
<i>-Just get rid of them.</i>
Who is this?

03:09.355 --> 03:10.815
Some weirdos are at the door.

03:13.902 --> 03:15.737
There's no use in denying it, Erika.

03:15.820 --> 03:19.574
All your questions about ghosts, then
Gavin talking about dating your friend

03:19.657 --> 03:23.411
who showed up at the cemetery with you,
but you were alone that night.

03:23.494 --> 03:25.622
And only Gavin, a known medium,
can see Gia.

03:25.705 --> 03:28.166
It took us a minute,
but we figured it out.

03:28.249 --> 03:30.543
Gia's dead and a ghost,

03:30.627 --> 03:31.920
and we're gonna find her.

03:32.003 --> 03:33.171
Mm-hm.

03:33.254 --> 03:34.589
Or what's left of her.

03:38.259 --> 03:40.595
You gotta get your friends to back off.
Gia's getting weaker.

03:40.678 --> 03:43.640
-We're running out of time.
-Then she's probably near her body.

03:43.723 --> 03:47.143
Gia won't ascend unless she finishes
her UFB. But what is her UFB?

03:47.227 --> 03:49.354
It's gotta be something personal,
insignificant,

03:49.437 --> 03:51.189
might be considered lame to others.

03:54.359 --> 03:56.236
-It's you.
-Me?

03:56.319 --> 03:58.404
You can communicate with spirits
when you're drunk,

03:58.488 --> 04:00.949
but you shouldn't be able
to see, hear, touch an embodied spirit

04:01.032 --> 04:03.034
unless you're her unfinished business.

04:03.117 --> 04:06.913
Which means we're both a part of it.
Whatever<i> it </i>is.

04:06.996 --> 04:08.498
We're the only people who can see her.

04:08.581 --> 04:10.208
Then why would she break up with me?

04:10.708 --> 04:11.834
To protect you.

04:11.918 --> 04:14.337
-From what?
-From getting hurt, I guess.

04:14.420 --> 04:17.507
She knew your relationship
was destined to be short-lived.

04:18.258 --> 04:20.176
She could've at least
gone to prom with me.

04:21.594 --> 04:25.223
Come on! Prom is the one thing
I wanna do before we graduate.

04:25.306 --> 04:28.268
Prom is going to be
the best night of my life!

04:28.893 --> 04:31.771
Prom! Gia's UFB is prom,
and you have to take her,

04:31.854 --> 04:34.941
which means I was meant to help her,
not the other way around.

04:35.024 --> 04:37.819
-We have to find her.
-I'll send Brad on a wild dove chase.

04:43.491 --> 04:48.288
I've been tracking Erika via Postmates.
She had, like, 15 deliveries to this spot.

04:48.371 --> 04:51.040
All from the convenience store
on Ridgeway, and all ice.

04:51.124 --> 04:54.335
She's either icing the body
or building an igloo.

04:54.419 --> 04:58.339
Raven, I thought you said you tracked
the body here via your six crows.

04:58.423 --> 05:00.633
Just because my name is Raven
doesn't mean I have witchery

05:00.717 --> 05:02.385
over the damn birds, Brad.

05:02.468 --> 05:05.138
But yes. The crows said this is the place.

05:05.221 --> 05:07.890
-Gavin pinged Gia's body.

05:07.974 --> 05:09.767
-We're in the wrong woods!
-Oh, shit!

05:14.355 --> 05:16.107
Gia's not in the house.
Did you find anything?

05:16.190 --> 05:18.651
Just her phone. I mean,
all of her texts from today are unread.

05:18.735 --> 05:21.404
And yesterday she was texting her mom
explaining everything.

05:21.487 --> 05:23.781
She's saying goodbye.
She's getting her affairs in order.

05:23.865 --> 05:26.034
That explains
the burnt diaries in the sink

05:26.117 --> 05:29.203
and the will written on the back
of a Forever 21 receipt.

05:29.287 --> 05:31.080
I don't know what,
but I gotta do something

05:31.164 --> 05:32.999
to help Gia get to prom so she can ascend.

05:33.082 --> 05:35.043
Okay. Yeah. I'll try to conjure her.

05:35.126 --> 05:36.794
I'm gonna do another loop.

05:38.212 --> 05:41.758
I would like to work in the highest
vibrational guides available to me.

05:42.675 --> 05:43.968
And I'm requesting to communicate

05:44.052 --> 05:46.220
with someone still tethered
to the Earth's plane.

05:47.388 --> 05:48.222
Her name is Gia.

06:27.261 --> 06:28.888
I don't know where you are,

06:29.764 --> 06:31.474
but this is not a hint.

06:32.350 --> 06:33.768
It's an order.

06:58.501 --> 06:59.419
<i>Leave a message.</i>

06:59.502 --> 07:01.337
<i>Make it short and sweet,</i>
<i>or I'll press delete.</i>

07:01.421 --> 07:04.590
Gia, I don't know what to do.

07:04.674 --> 07:08.010
I don't know how to reach you,
or if you're still here.

07:08.886 --> 07:10.805
You're always the one
that tells me what to do.

07:11.389 --> 07:14.642
Please give me a sign.
Please tell me what to do.

07:26.446 --> 07:28.030
You want me to go to prom.

07:32.285 --> 07:34.287
-Yo.
-Hey, man. What's up?

07:34.912 --> 07:37.039
-Nothing.
-What do you mean, "nothing"?

07:37.123 --> 07:39.584
-You gotta go to prom, man.
-Look. I don't know if I'm gonna go.

07:39.667 --> 07:43.337
It feels weird going alone,
but maybe I'll hit up the after-party.

07:43.421 --> 07:46.674
-So go with a friend.
-How many people are on this call?

07:46.757 --> 07:49.719
Archer and I are going together,
and I can barely tolerate him.

07:49.802 --> 07:52.472
-I'm on the call, Sophia.
-I know.

07:52.555 --> 07:55.725
If this is about the hotel room,
you guys can keep the deposit.

07:55.808 --> 07:57.727
No, man. We just want you there.

07:57.810 --> 08:01.731
It won't be the same without you.
Obviously, we're gonna keep your deposit.

08:01.814 --> 08:04.025
Circling back to the friend thing,
maybe you can go with--

08:04.108 --> 08:05.443
-I gotta go. Bye.

08:10.031 --> 08:11.741
Why are you smiling like that?

08:11.824 --> 08:14.744
Uh, you've never let me
see you get ready before.

08:14.827 --> 08:17.455
Well, I hope it is everything
that you dreamed of.

08:17.538 --> 08:19.165
-Yeah, yeah.

08:22.585 --> 08:25.546
It would mean a lot to me

08:26.506 --> 08:29.675
if we could
go to prom together as friends.

08:31.052 --> 08:33.387
I don't want us
to have any future life regrets.

08:33.471 --> 08:36.807
And you don't wanna be the first
prom queen without a date, right?

08:36.891 --> 08:37.767
And that.

08:39.477 --> 08:41.771
Okay. Yeah, sure. Let's… Let's do it.

08:41.854 --> 08:43.773
-Wait. Really?
-Yeah.

08:47.652 --> 08:49.820
Wear the black shoes
you wore to your aunt's wedding,

08:49.904 --> 08:52.907
shave twice, and use only 1/8th teaspoon
of that molding paste.

08:52.990 --> 08:54.575
-And no cologne!
-Yeah.

09:11.092 --> 09:13.511
I know I am the last person
you expected to see here,

09:13.594 --> 09:16.138
but I… I wanted to apologize
for canceling prom,

09:16.222 --> 09:19.767
and ruining your prom presentation
and your beautiful crochet banner.

09:22.311 --> 09:24.772
-I love your dress, by the way.
-Thanks.

09:24.855 --> 09:26.566
I actually hate midnight blue now.

09:26.649 --> 09:28.568
Half the girls here are wearing it,
thanks to you.

09:29.819 --> 09:31.571
I am sorry for that too.

09:33.239 --> 09:34.323
May I please buy a ticket?

09:35.533 --> 09:37.451
Sorry. We're at capacity.

09:37.535 --> 09:39.120
What about a standby ticket?

09:39.203 --> 09:41.581
Oh. Sure. You can stand by the exit.

09:42.999 --> 09:45.459
Listen, Emma.
I don't even wanna be here, okay?

09:45.543 --> 09:48.588
Going to prom alone
seemed like a nightmare for Helen Who,

09:48.671 --> 09:51.507
but as Erika Vu,
it's gonna be Shit Town in Hell City.

09:51.591 --> 09:53.968
But I need to go to fricking prom, okay?

09:54.051 --> 09:56.887
It is a matter of life or… eternity.

09:57.597 --> 09:58.639
Wow.

09:58.723 --> 09:59.765
That was

10:01.183 --> 10:03.227
extremely confusing and a little sad.

10:03.311 --> 10:05.521
Sorry. I don't have any more tickets.

10:05.605 --> 10:06.564
I do.

10:09.442 --> 10:11.110
You can have my extra ticket.

10:11.193 --> 10:14.572
I decided to go solo since I'm getting
so much sunshine from the ladies.

10:14.655 --> 10:15.906
Why would you wanna help me?

10:15.990 --> 10:18.701
After the video of you
rear-ending my car went viral,

10:18.784 --> 10:21.621
#ErikaVuTriesToKillDevon was trending.

10:22.121 --> 10:25.333
And now Stinky's dead,
and I'm having a resurgence.

10:26.250 --> 10:29.086
-Thanks for trying to kill me.
-I wasn't trying to…

10:30.963 --> 10:32.006
Thanks.

10:47.063 --> 10:49.982
-It's Erika Vu.
-I can't believe she showed up.

10:50.066 --> 10:51.359
I have to go tell him.

11:36.445 --> 11:39.573
I should've known Gavin was lying to us.
The crows knew.

11:39.657 --> 11:41.659
-He screwed us.
-So he could screw Gia.

11:41.742 --> 11:44.495
-I'm gonna hex that son of a bitch.
-No, you're not. He…

11:45.538 --> 11:48.416
did it for love. Look, we didn't start
this club to make friends.

11:48.499 --> 11:51.460
This isn't cooking club. We're dark
and disturbed, and all about the work.

11:52.586 --> 11:54.004
But Gavin's our boy.

11:55.798 --> 11:59.176
Come on, Raven.
I know your tiny heart beats occasionally.

11:59.927 --> 12:03.514
Gavin's here, which means Gia may show up.
Let's set up the séance.

12:03.597 --> 12:06.016
-I'll take lead.
-Uhh, hold your Magic 8 Balls.

12:06.684 --> 12:07.893
This is my jam.

12:42.762 --> 12:45.598
I am so, so sorry. I didn't mean
any of the things I said, and I'm--

12:45.681 --> 12:47.433
You're looking crazy. Put your earbuds in.

12:47.516 --> 12:49.685
-I don't care.
-Crazy bitch.

12:49.769 --> 12:51.687
That's right. I'm a crazy bitch.

12:51.771 --> 12:55.566
I was trying to text you back, but I was
fading away. Until like an hour ago.

12:56.525 --> 12:58.736
-That's when I showed up here.
-Alone.

12:58.819 --> 13:01.739
Which is the bravest thing
that you have ever done.

13:01.822 --> 13:04.617
And now I know that you're gonna be okay.
So I can go.

13:05.367 --> 13:08.662
You're not done yet.
I'm not your only unfinished business.

13:16.128 --> 13:17.797
-But… But what about--
-Me?

13:18.672 --> 13:22.676
No. It's time to put yourself first
for once. Go be with your weirdo.

13:22.760 --> 13:24.595
Okay.

13:41.070 --> 13:42.655
Uh, is that you?

13:42.738 --> 13:44.448
Oh, uh, my obsidian?

13:44.532 --> 13:46.909
Yeah. I got it to help channel you,

13:46.992 --> 13:50.037
but when I went back to your house,
I noticed that your prom dress was gone,

13:50.120 --> 13:52.289
so I figured you'd be here.

13:56.961 --> 13:58.295
That's me. That's me.

14:23.696 --> 14:25.322
Woo! Haha!

14:26.115 --> 14:28.367
Haha, yeah! Woo!

14:35.249 --> 14:38.002
-Oh, sorry. I'll leave.
-No, it's fine.

14:38.085 --> 14:39.795
Everyone's dancing.

14:45.718 --> 14:49.305
Up until a month ago,
I never had any expectations for prom.

14:49.388 --> 14:52.516
But now that I see
how much it means to everyone,

14:52.600 --> 14:54.310
I totally get it.

14:55.394 --> 14:56.687
And it's beautiful.

14:56.770 --> 14:58.188
-Is it?
-Yeah.

14:58.856 --> 15:00.274
But it doesn't have a theme.

15:00.357 --> 15:02.943
It's like the first prom in history
to not have one.

15:03.027 --> 15:05.988
Most of our decorations
were trashed at prom assembly.

15:06.655 --> 15:09.199
I mean, how are you supposed
to have a lasting memory of this night

15:09.283 --> 15:11.660
without… a night to remember?

15:11.744 --> 15:15.247
What kind of legacy is this?
It's like it didn't even exist.

15:16.165 --> 15:18.876
The only thing people are gonna remember
is who won prom queen.

15:23.422 --> 15:25.466
Tell me it's not too late
to add a name to the ballot.

15:26.050 --> 15:27.468
Oh, um, sorry.

15:27.551 --> 15:30.679
The votes have already been counted.
Alyssa's about to announce the winners.

15:35.351 --> 15:37.937
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Hi. Hi, hello. Um…

15:38.020 --> 15:41.357
It's time to announce
the Prom King and Queen.

15:41.440 --> 15:44.068
But can… can we keep it down
to a Billie Eilish whisper?

15:44.151 --> 15:46.153
Please? Thank you.

15:46.236 --> 15:50.658
The Parkway High Prom King is…

15:50.741 --> 15:52.868
…Devon Evan Kahler.

15:54.328 --> 15:56.538
-Yeah!

15:56.622 --> 15:59.249
-Yeah! Y'all love me now, right?
-Please…

16:03.754 --> 16:06.215
The Parkway High Prom Queen is…

16:08.008 --> 16:09.802
…uh, to nobody's surprise,

16:09.885 --> 16:11.053
Riley Bhatia.

16:13.097 --> 16:15.599
Please don't yell.
Please don't yell.

16:15.683 --> 16:17.685
-Yeah, Riley!
-Knew that was coming.

16:18.352 --> 16:19.311
Take the crown.

16:21.730 --> 16:22.815
Wait!

16:22.898 --> 16:25.192
-Come on.

16:26.819 --> 16:29.488
-Hey, knock it off! Let her speak!

16:37.287 --> 16:39.581
I know
you think you know me,

16:39.665 --> 16:41.166
maybe as Helen Who,

16:41.250 --> 16:44.795
or maybe as that bitch
who tried to cancel prom.

16:45.629 --> 16:47.965
But all I need you to know about me

16:48.549 --> 16:51.468
is that my best friend Gia recently died.

16:52.886 --> 16:54.221
No. No, what are you doing?

16:55.848 --> 16:58.225
-Oh my God, I hear Gia.
-The crystals are working.

16:58.308 --> 17:00.394
Oh my God.
My first paranormal interaction!

17:00.477 --> 17:01.687
I did sleep with my cousin,

17:02.187 --> 17:03.480
and I do not regret it.

17:03.564 --> 17:05.065
But this is not about me.

17:05.566 --> 17:09.028
This is about Gia, who you didn't even
notice was gone, but how could you?

17:09.903 --> 17:12.281
You didn't even notice her
when she was here.

17:12.865 --> 17:15.951
Which makes you very, very lucky,

17:16.035 --> 17:18.537
because you are not going to have to miss

17:18.620 --> 17:22.541
having the most amazing human being
by your side.

17:23.709 --> 17:27.838
So, while you guys go on
living your life not missing Gia,

17:27.921 --> 17:32.342
I am going to miss
every single thing about her.

17:33.260 --> 17:36.346
I'm gonna miss
how she would sing so loud in the car

17:36.430 --> 17:38.557
that people would stare at stoplights.

17:39.850 --> 17:43.979
And her impromptu dances
down the tampon aisles at CVS.

17:45.981 --> 17:48.150
And how she would secretly turn on a light

17:48.233 --> 17:50.110
after we watched a scary movie.

17:50.611 --> 17:53.280
But not because she was afraid,

17:54.031 --> 17:55.657
but because she knew I was.

17:56.366 --> 18:01.038
I… I thought that maybe being loved
by thousands would fill my soul,

18:01.121 --> 18:03.540
but it is nowhere near as good

18:03.624 --> 18:07.169
as having one incredible best friend
like Gia.

18:08.837 --> 18:12.174
And… being hated by thousands was…

18:15.260 --> 18:17.638
…nowhere near as painful as losing her.

18:19.139 --> 18:21.517
I know you already voted for Prom Queen,

18:22.184 --> 18:26.146
but I was wondering if you would
reconsider a posthumous revote

18:26.230 --> 18:27.064
for Gia.

18:29.108 --> 18:31.318
I won fair and square!

18:34.404 --> 18:37.366
But I think Gia would make
a wonderful dead Prom Queen.

18:38.033 --> 18:40.119
Gia! Gia!

18:40.202 --> 18:42.204
Gia! Gia

18:48.418 --> 18:50.796
I accept this crown on Gia's behalf.

18:51.797 --> 18:53.632
All right, everybody out
on the dance floor.

18:53.715 --> 18:55.884
Let's give it up for Gia!

18:55.968 --> 18:57.970
-Gia

19:35.007 --> 19:36.258
Guys, it's Gia.

19:37.593 --> 19:39.344
You guys, look. It's her.

19:52.858 --> 19:53.859
Hey, you.

19:54.860 --> 19:55.777
Hey.

19:56.486 --> 19:59.448
I… I'm really sorry about Gia.

20:00.073 --> 20:01.909
She sounds awesome.

20:03.243 --> 20:04.953
I really wish I'd… I'd known her.

20:06.788 --> 20:09.082
You know, I guess you're a… a GAF too.

20:09.917 --> 20:11.293
I learned from the best.

20:11.376 --> 20:12.336
-Mm.

20:14.713 --> 20:18.050
Is… Is it just me,
or does it feel like maybe

20:18.133 --> 20:20.844
I never got to meet the real Erika Vu?

20:22.262 --> 20:24.306
Well, you didn't. I used to be dead.

20:24.890 --> 20:25.849
Uh…

20:25.933 --> 20:28.518
Sorry, uh, story for another lifetime.

20:29.228 --> 20:32.522
Anyway, this is me. I am her.

20:34.691 --> 20:35.692
Hi, you.

20:36.318 --> 20:37.277
Hi.

20:38.320 --> 20:39.363
Going to the after-party?

20:40.197 --> 20:42.241
No, I'm probably just gonna head home.

20:46.578 --> 20:48.330
Well, uh, I'll see you.

20:48.413 --> 20:49.957
Okay. Bye.

20:58.799 --> 21:00.634
Okay. I'll go.

22:12.789 --> 22:14.458
Gia would've loved this party.

22:14.541 --> 22:17.085
I wish that she could see me
living my best life.

22:17.169 --> 22:18.086
Oh, she can.

22:18.754 --> 22:20.714
And, if you look hard enough,
you can see her too.

22:21.214 --> 22:23.717
You know, through a cloud,
or an animal, or…

22:23.800 --> 22:25.177
A sconce?

22:29.014 --> 22:30.015
Cheers.

22:35.812 --> 22:38.565
So in third grade,

22:38.648 --> 22:41.902
Gia and I went on a foreign exchange trip.

22:43.028 --> 22:45.530
-Third grade?
-In third grade. You wouldn't imagine.

23:01.296 --> 23:04.007
-You got another package.
-Thanks.

23:04.091 --> 23:05.884
Well, I'm off to dinner. You coming?

23:05.967 --> 23:07.803
-In a minute. I'll meet you there.
-Okay.

23:16.895 --> 23:18.021
Oh.

23:35.080 --> 23:36.415
I see you, bitch.
