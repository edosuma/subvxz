WEBVTT

00:01.500 --> 00:03.940
Sir, I have a missile fire order
from the Antarctic Network.

00:03.947 --> 00:04.987
Why the Antarctic Network?

00:05.042 --> 00:08.188
I'm not going to annihilate
4.3 million Pakistanis

00:08.318 --> 00:11.089
without hearing from someone
whose authority I recognize.

00:11.090 --> 00:13.170
(Cameron) I got a fix on
the boat who shot us, sir.

00:13.171 --> 00:13.971
It's the "Illinois."

00:13.972 --> 00:15.252
Our own people tried to sink us?

00:15.374 --> 00:17.574
(Kylie) The "Colorado"
has its own magnetic signature,

00:17.575 --> 00:19.477
which turns a $4-billion sub

00:19.632 --> 00:21.121
into a sitting duck.

00:21.244 --> 00:23.385
Except now with the prototype
I've put on board...

00:23.533 --> 00:24.729
no signature.

00:24.894 --> 00:27.374
(Chaplin) We have commandeered
the NATO early warning station

00:27.375 --> 00:28.615
on the island of Sainte Marina.

00:28.655 --> 00:30.756
I am declaring
a 200-mile no-man's-land

00:30.868 --> 00:31.887
around this island.

00:32.017 --> 00:33.317
Sam? Sam, is that you?

00:33.419 --> 00:34.288
It's me. I'm okay.

00:34.300 --> 00:36.140
Listen to me, I don't know
what you've heard,

00:36.141 --> 00:37.141
but I can explain it all.

00:37.142 --> 00:38.182
Just please believe in me.

00:38.314 --> 00:39.297
On your knees!

00:39.409 --> 00:40.621
I'm not gonna let you do this.

00:43.694 --> 00:45.207
What the hell did you just do?

00:45.352 --> 00:47.312
(Chaplin) If the current
United States executive

00:47.313 --> 00:48.563
violates this perimeter,

00:48.665 --> 00:51.491
we will all burn together.

00:52.065 --> 00:53.339
You've been warned.

00:55.323 --> 00:58.323
Sync and corrections by n17t01
www.addic7ed.com

01:00.057 --> 01:02.939
<i>(Man) Hey, dad. So this will be</i>
<i>the last of these for a while.</i>

01:03.352 --> 01:04.474
<i>We're headed out tomorrow.</i>

01:04.602 --> 01:05.686
<i>I'm excited.</i>

01:06.281 --> 01:06.921
(Computer beeps)

01:06.989 --> 01:08.867
We're ready.

01:12.741 --> 01:13.861
(Man) Captain's on the conn.

01:13.872 --> 01:14.510
Status?

01:14.624 --> 01:16.910
Heading 0-7-0 to a depth
of 200 feet, sir.

01:17.004 --> 01:17.899
Very well. Sonar?

01:17.900 --> 01:19.260
The "Princeton" and the "Monterey"

01:19.261 --> 01:20.341
have reached the perimeter.

01:20.364 --> 01:22.484
I'm tracking 16 other
signatures, all closing on us.

01:22.632 --> 01:25.653
Well, people, we are now
the popular girl at the dance.

01:25.746 --> 01:27.186
Lieutenant Shepard, what do you see?

01:27.187 --> 01:28.627
We're reading some 20 other warships

01:28.691 --> 01:30.230
closing in
on the 200-mile line,

01:30.343 --> 01:32.353
most should arrive
within the next 48 hours.

01:32.461 --> 01:33.981
We're preparing to test the prototype.

01:33.982 --> 01:35.104
Keep those eyes on us.

01:35.599 --> 01:37.279
Sophie, should we be helping these people?

01:37.388 --> 01:39.388
You have to decide that for yourself.

01:39.482 --> 01:40.816
I won't be a part of it.

01:43.214 --> 01:44.290
Engineering, conn.

01:44.487 --> 01:46.455
Stand ready to engage
the Perseus prototype.

01:46.650 --> 01:47.581
(Man) Aye-aye, sir.

01:48.265 --> 01:50.680
The prototype is tied in to
every major system on the sub.

01:50.783 --> 01:52.212
It goes down, we're done.

01:53.859 --> 01:54.739
And with respect, sir,

01:54.740 --> 01:57.140
we should be on the phone with
DC sorting through this mess

01:57.141 --> 01:58.503
before it can't be sorted out.

02:01.500 --> 02:02.406
(Clicks switch)

02:02.570 --> 02:04.330
Attention, all hands.
This is your Captain.

02:04.433 --> 02:06.485
There are some 20-plus warships
descending on us.

02:06.587 --> 02:09.282
These are our brothers in arms,
sent now to kill us.

02:09.388 --> 02:10.548
There will be a time to talk,

02:10.592 --> 02:12.587
but right now we show strength.

02:12.710 --> 02:13.316
Captain, out.

02:13.443 --> 02:14.209
(Click)

02:14.738 --> 02:16.604
Engineering, conn.
Engage the Perseus.

02:17.335 --> 02:18.411
Aye, sir.

02:23.711 --> 02:25.264
(Beeping)

02:30.054 --> 02:31.834
SSTD is still online, sir.

02:33.007 --> 02:34.636
(Whir) (Computer beeps)

02:34.935 --> 02:36.566
You just vanished off our screen, sir.

02:36.755 --> 02:38.565
Looks like the prototype works.

02:39.397 --> 02:40.560
(Radar pinging)

02:40.659 --> 02:41.877
(Man) They're hunting for us.

02:41.996 --> 02:44.356
Sir, something patrolling low
right outside the perimeter.

02:44.357 --> 02:45.352
ID off those screws,

02:45.477 --> 02:46.363
it's the "Illinois."

02:46.364 --> 02:48.204
She's dipping back and forth
across the line.

02:48.205 --> 02:49.165
She's testing the fence.

02:49.264 --> 02:50.744
We don't make that line real to them,

02:50.745 --> 02:52.625
sooner or later,
she'll cross over to kill us.

02:52.626 --> 02:54.164
Man battle stations.

02:55.120 --> 02:57.485
134 on board the "Illinois," sir.

02:58.072 --> 02:58.863
(Pinging continues)

03:01.526 --> 03:03.680
Helm, put us on intercept
with the "Illinois."

03:09.486 --> 03:11.140
Captain, they've just disappeared.

03:11.505 --> 03:13.559
Looks like Marcus has a new toy.

03:14.399 --> 03:15.761
Listen carefully.

03:17.000 --> 03:23.074
Advertise your product or brand here

03:28.371 --> 03:29.504
(Alarm blaring)

03:29.718 --> 03:31.630
Launch transients dead astern!

03:31.964 --> 03:33.676
Evasive maneuver...
right full rudder.

03:33.773 --> 03:34.932
Launch countermeasures now!

03:35.021 --> 03:36.664
Too late. Torpedo is homing.

03:36.772 --> 03:39.158
Impact in five, four...

03:39.347 --> 03:40.855
Three, two...

03:42.995 --> 03:45.051
(Thuds)

03:45.685 --> 03:46.999
Disabled warhead's a hit, sir.

03:47.105 --> 03:48.065
"Illinois" turning away.

03:48.161 --> 03:49.436
She's rolling over,

03:49.576 --> 03:50.812
showing us her belly.

03:51.633 --> 03:53.676
But she'll still bite
if she gets the chance.

03:53.925 --> 03:55.165
(Radio clatters) Weapons, conn.

03:55.166 --> 03:56.846
The next torpedo's armed.
Keep your lock.

03:56.865 --> 03:57.971
Nav...
(Radio clatters)

03:58.075 --> 03:58.932
Take us back.

03:59.028 --> 04:00.166
Yes, sir.

04:04.022 --> 04:05.262
<i>(Man speaks indistinctly on TV)</i>

04:05.263 --> 04:06.543
Do you see?

04:06.691 --> 04:08.824
The devastation could have been so much...

04:08.910 --> 04:09.910
(Christine) "Could have"?

04:09.911 --> 04:11.981
That's gotta be maybe 200 miles
off the coast.

04:12.087 --> 04:15.241
That's further than Vegas was
to the Nevada test range.

04:15.485 --> 04:18.137
And they set off
a couple hundred nukes there.

04:18.392 --> 04:19.159
(Man) Your husband

04:19.261 --> 04:21.507
and all the men and women
following Marcus Chaplin

04:21.640 --> 04:23.259
will die

04:23.374 --> 04:25.096
if we can't end this now.

04:25.728 --> 04:27.333
Now Sam is out there alone.

04:27.454 --> 04:28.315
He's confused.

04:28.408 --> 04:30.137
He probably wants, more than anything,

04:30.316 --> 04:31.789
just to do the right thing.

04:32.518 --> 04:34.278
<i>(Man continues speaking</i>
<i>indistinctly on TV)</i>

04:34.279 --> 04:35.235
Then help him.

04:36.316 --> 04:37.476
(Chaplin) Sitrep, Lieutenant.

04:37.477 --> 04:39.277
(Shepard) We've
manned stations and patrols,

04:39.278 --> 04:41.718
but about a quarter of the crew
aren't reporting for shifts.

04:41.866 --> 04:43.306
Cortez and Brannan are still missing

04:43.307 --> 04:43.987
and assumed AWOL.

04:43.988 --> 04:45.705
Cortez is third tour.
She's not AWOL.

04:45.896 --> 04:47.198
We gotta start looking for 'em.

04:47.298 --> 04:48.716
And, sir, the COB...

04:48.830 --> 04:50.830
he's under guard in what
the town uses as a jail,

04:50.831 --> 04:52.937
and he is not making things any easier.

04:54.480 --> 04:56.329
(Engine revs)

04:57.637 --> 04:58.741
(Engine turns off)

05:02.221 --> 05:03.517
Sailor, open the gate.

05:04.997 --> 05:06.476
Tell her we ain't home, Red.

05:07.455 --> 05:09.142
Sailor, I just gave you a direct order.

05:09.434 --> 05:11.980
Sorry, ma'am.
I don't have the key.

05:13.495 --> 05:14.455
(Chief) You know, Grace,

05:14.456 --> 05:16.572
when they find you guilty
of mutiny, of murder,

05:17.321 --> 05:19.708
it's not gonna be the jail cell
that gets to you.

05:20.149 --> 05:21.989
It's gonna be the sound
of the people outside

05:22.038 --> 05:23.477
chanting for your death.

05:23.557 --> 05:25.408
That's what's gonna drive you insane...

05:25.509 --> 05:26.355
Break it down.

05:26.499 --> 05:27.899
And knowing that your admiral daddy

05:27.900 --> 05:29.540
is not gonna be able to visit your grave.

05:29.541 --> 05:30.741
I said, break it down. Now.

05:30.836 --> 05:32.176
(Chaplin) Lieutenant.

05:33.831 --> 05:35.133
Open it up.

05:35.773 --> 05:36.714
(Lock clatters)

05:37.503 --> 05:38.226
(Clinks)

05:41.620 --> 05:44.100
She should've never been wearing
those stripes to begin with.

05:44.202 --> 05:46.584
But you put her there,
and she killed one of my men.

05:47.500 --> 05:48.938
You have everything you need, COB?

05:49.502 --> 05:52.473
I never would've believed that
my friend and commanding officer

05:52.593 --> 05:55.534
would go soft when it
came time to do his duty.

05:55.703 --> 05:56.732
Oh, I know my duty.

05:56.843 --> 05:58.070
Do you?

05:58.188 --> 06:01.781
Your duty, sir, is to fire
when you're told to fire.

06:01.965 --> 06:03.654
Your duty, sir, is to be the strong

06:03.764 --> 06:05.782
and unwavering fist of our nation.

06:05.890 --> 06:08.210
Why'd they send the orders
through the Antarctic channel?

06:09.285 --> 06:10.395
Why would they fire on us?

06:10.499 --> 06:11.526
I'm a sailor.

06:12.342 --> 06:13.785
I don't have the luxury to ask.

06:13.892 --> 06:14.825
No, you don't,

06:14.915 --> 06:16.935
which is why you're the COB,
and I'm the Captain.

06:17.817 --> 06:19.448
You're my friend, Marcus.

06:20.280 --> 06:22.785
But you're no longer
the captain of my boat.

06:22.895 --> 06:24.878
That uniform you're still wearing?

06:24.995 --> 06:26.662
That's borrowed glory.

06:29.576 --> 06:31.353
I've always appreciated your candor, COB.

06:37.607 --> 06:38.957
Lock it up, sailor.

06:42.852 --> 06:44.197
You all right, Lieutenant?

06:45.324 --> 06:46.466
Not really.

06:47.118 --> 06:48.904
XO, you're gonna have to relieve me.

06:49.793 --> 06:52.451
I'm sorry, but I'm not setting
an example for the enlisted.

06:53.042 --> 06:54.675
And it's not their fault.
It's me.

06:55.284 --> 06:56.364
I don't know who I am here.

06:56.395 --> 06:57.946
Well, then figure it out.

06:58.493 --> 06:58.985
(Sighs)

06:59.096 --> 07:00.959
Look, we lose control here,
we're all dead.

07:01.048 --> 07:02.263
You get that?

07:02.896 --> 07:04.696
I can't fix this for you,
but I do need you.

07:04.770 --> 07:06.074
They don't believe in you?

07:06.346 --> 07:07.860
You make them, today.

07:09.375 --> 07:12.128
(Engines roaring)

07:14.103 --> 07:16.245
(Shepard) That's closer than 200 miles.

07:18.539 --> 07:20.422
Aircraft crossed the perimeter
15 seconds ago.

07:20.649 --> 07:23.089
(Alarm blaring) Whatever it is, it's big.
Working the ident.

07:23.090 --> 07:25.233
Open hatches. Make sure
the world can see it.

07:26.086 --> 07:27.884
(Rumbles)

07:28.027 --> 07:30.107
"Eisenhower" is scrambling F-18s
to intercept, sir.

07:30.232 --> 07:32.712
They're asking if they can cross
our line to turn her around.

07:32.713 --> 07:33.393
ID the bird, now.

07:33.394 --> 07:34.333
Wait.

07:34.917 --> 07:35.677
(Blaring continues)

07:35.678 --> 07:39.370
Pilot of Taiwan air 29-76,
turn around. Do you hear me?

07:39.555 --> 07:40.633
It's a passenger 747.

07:40.742 --> 07:43.860
(Speaking French) _

07:45.880 --> 07:47.771
How close do you think it got?

07:47.908 --> 07:49.342
I don't know.
Maybe 40 miles.

07:50.186 --> 07:52.266
A Delta Force Team could
HALO down from that plane,

07:52.267 --> 07:53.467
hit the water on the far side,

07:53.468 --> 07:54.148
paddle in.

07:54.544 --> 07:56.144
They could be here six hours after that.

07:56.145 --> 07:57.608
They didn't waste any time.

07:58.160 --> 07:59.322
I'll go.

07:59.735 --> 08:01.255
I'll take a team, try and cut 'em off.

08:01.312 --> 08:02.912
- Sam, if those are Deltas...
- I know.

08:03.078 --> 08:05.558
If they don't think we made 'em,
maybe we get the upper hand.

08:06.239 --> 08:07.679
You stay here.
You do what you can.

08:07.680 --> 08:08.672
I'll go.

08:08.777 --> 08:09.970
Show strength.

08:10.762 --> 08:11.949
Then talk.

08:18.146 --> 08:18.786
If you're right,

08:18.787 --> 08:20.627
you'll need a second out there
you can trust.

08:22.134 --> 08:23.983
Volunteering for the mission, sir.

08:25.121 --> 08:26.835
(People speaking indistinctly)

08:29.550 --> 08:31.001
Hangover cure.

08:31.142 --> 08:32.982
Drink it.
There's another at the bar.

08:33.337 --> 08:34.857
I thought you special forces hot shots

08:34.857 --> 08:36.626
could handle your liquor.

08:36.844 --> 08:37.924
(James) Do you have a boat,

08:38.102 --> 08:39.712
some way off the island?

08:39.828 --> 08:40.964
There are boats, but...

08:41.063 --> 08:42.551
Get yourself off this rock.

08:43.067 --> 08:44.187
This whole place just became

08:44.188 --> 08:45.708
the biggest bull's-eye
on the planet.

08:45.904 --> 08:48.400
(Chuckles) I'm sorry.
It's just...

08:48.698 --> 08:50.818
This whole island is a volcano.

08:50.925 --> 08:52.403
The stories we heard as kids,

08:52.602 --> 08:55.519
they were about lands plucked
from the bottom of the ocean

08:55.654 --> 08:56.898
by a giant fish hook

08:56.991 --> 08:59.680
or tossed down from the sky by angry gods.

08:59.783 --> 09:01.952
Telling an islander
they're going to die violently

09:02.141 --> 09:04.562
is just reminding us we're home.

09:05.241 --> 09:06.962
(People continue speaking indistinctly)

09:07.415 --> 09:08.947
Shower's $10.

09:10.494 --> 09:11.579
(Exhales)

09:12.217 --> 09:13.083
Didn't ask.

09:13.194 --> 09:14.328
You will.

09:18.572 --> 09:20.338
(James vomits)

09:21.063 --> 09:21.882
(Coughs)

09:23.225 --> 09:24.194
(Cough)

09:26.815 --> 09:28.061
Gentlemen.

09:28.881 --> 09:31.446
(Chuckles) You saw that plane?

09:31.546 --> 09:32.638
Yeah.

09:32.753 --> 09:34.153
I'd say you got yourself a bad case

09:34.154 --> 09:36.359
of between seven and ten special forces.

09:36.453 --> 09:37.649
Almost certainly Delta.

09:37.765 --> 09:39.045
So you think they'll move for us

09:39.046 --> 09:40.022
or for the sub first?

09:40.412 --> 09:42.492
My captain seems to think
you might be of some help

09:42.493 --> 09:43.609
coming up with a plan here.

09:43.859 --> 09:45.009
A plan?

09:45.120 --> 09:46.113
Yeah, a plan.

09:46.222 --> 09:47.623
You're not coming up with a plan.

09:47.731 --> 09:50.602
What you're working on is just
a really complicated suicide.

09:50.738 --> 09:52.183
Okay, let me get one thing straight.

09:52.270 --> 09:54.230
I'm only here because
my captain asked me to be.

09:54.265 --> 09:56.065
'Cause me? I'd rather
beat my own brains out

09:56.086 --> 09:57.736
than have you help me with anything.

09:57.737 --> 09:59.417
So do me a favor.
Why don't you stay here

09:59.418 --> 10:01.818
and drink yourself more stupid,
if that's humanly possible?

10:01.819 --> 10:02.659
Thanks for your help.

10:04.787 --> 10:05.356
(Thuds)

10:05.561 --> 10:08.001
Oh, Whoo! That is good.

10:13.399 --> 10:14.479
13 of our sailors are about

10:14.480 --> 10:16.560
to face off with something
they don't understand...

10:16.656 --> 10:18.656
Do you want to know what's
the really great thing

10:18.657 --> 10:19.697
about a perfect HALO jump?

10:20.311 --> 10:21.827
It's that, before the jump,

10:21.929 --> 10:23.449
you're still stateside in your head...

10:23.791 --> 10:26.198
rent, ex-girlfriends,
car payment, whatever.

10:26.870 --> 10:29.093
That free fall...
it cleans you right out.

10:29.192 --> 10:30.456
By the time you rip your chute,

10:30.609 --> 10:31.931
everything's gone.

10:32.806 --> 10:35.438
And what's left
is a single-minded focus

10:35.536 --> 10:36.863
to accomplish the mission,

10:37.185 --> 10:39.638
which in this case would be
killing you and your pals.

10:41.533 --> 10:43.093
Look, the least you could do is tell...

10:43.204 --> 10:45.364
If I had to choose sides,
I'd be out there with them.

10:45.365 --> 10:45.901
So this?

10:46.002 --> 10:47.658
This is the very least I can do.

10:52.938 --> 10:54.096
Hi.

10:54.262 --> 10:55.282
Hi.

10:55.438 --> 10:57.038
So we think there might be some soldiers

10:57.039 --> 10:57.959
coming over the island.

10:58.245 --> 11:00.085
Since you know this place
better than anyone,

11:01.046 --> 11:02.488
I was hoping to get your help.

11:02.947 --> 11:03.710
(Huffs)

11:04.329 --> 11:05.849
You know, I don't really think you get

11:05.897 --> 11:07.057
what's going on here, do you?

11:07.167 --> 11:08.228
Oh, I do.

11:08.841 --> 11:11.587
I understand that millions
of people died yesterday.

11:11.813 --> 11:13.293
But do you understand?

11:13.857 --> 11:14.901
No, you can't.

11:15.009 --> 11:16.409
Because you're a soldier.
(Scoffs)

11:16.410 --> 11:18.482
You're made to believe
such things are normal.

11:18.647 --> 11:20.383
Have you even looked at the TV?

11:20.617 --> 11:21.701
Have you seen the faces...

11:21.803 --> 11:24.149
Hey, we're the ones that
didn't fire. Do you get that?

11:24.474 --> 11:25.440
Do you get it?

11:25.545 --> 11:28.042
Me and my captain, we didn't
fire nukes at Pakistan.

11:28.151 --> 11:30.464
You know what the prize is
for being such stand-up guys?

11:31.249 --> 11:33.936
Men come to kill us and kill
anyone that gets in their way.

11:34.929 --> 11:36.925
And right now
our only advantage is surprise.

11:37.086 --> 11:38.832
And I'm here asking for your help.

11:38.953 --> 11:40.834
XO, a call's come in for you.

11:41.954 --> 11:43.212
I thought the phones were dead.

11:43.319 --> 11:44.935
So did we.
You should take this.

11:55.785 --> 11:57.201
Hello.

11:57.387 --> 11:58.715
Hey, babe.

11:59.422 --> 12:02.127
(Exhales) I've been trying to
reach you again. Are you okay?

12:02.407 --> 12:03.484
I know. I know.

12:04.399 --> 12:06.295
Things have been pretty crazy here.

12:07.066 --> 12:09.142
And I bet for you, too,
right? (Sniffles)

12:10.470 --> 12:11.350
Christine, talk to me.

12:11.457 --> 12:12.881
Are you okay?

12:13.926 --> 12:16.056
Sam, they'll give you full amnesty...

12:16.986 --> 12:17.787
You and the crew.

12:17.890 --> 12:18.978
All you have to do

12:19.080 --> 12:20.531
is give them the sub.

12:23.847 --> 12:25.895
And you have to give them Marcus.

12:27.303 --> 12:28.761
(Sighs)

12:31.317 --> 12:33.592
They're ready to let you come back to me.

12:41.165 --> 12:42.563
Sam...

12:45.192 --> 12:46.521
(Voice breaks) don't trust them.

12:46.658 --> 12:48.018
(Crying) Whatever they say to you,

12:48.019 --> 12:49.539
whatever I say to you, don't trust it!

12:49.540 --> 12:51.457
Just know that I love you, Sam!
I love you!

12:55.795 --> 12:57.118
(Exhales)

12:57.997 --> 12:59.348
(Receiver clatters)

13:02.104 --> 13:04.094
We knew this wouldn't just be bullets.

13:04.200 --> 13:07.012
They'll come at you
where it hurts the most.

13:10.554 --> 13:11.852
You okay?

13:14.989 --> 13:17.249
We'll get inland and we'll
set up a kill zone.

13:19.319 --> 13:21.198
Maybe they walk right into it.

13:23.629 --> 13:26.418
Worst-case scenario,
they get wise, they kill us all.

13:28.091 --> 13:28.937
Best-case scenario,

13:29.056 --> 13:31.663
we send a complement
of American body bags home.

13:35.264 --> 13:37.049
Either way, this sucks.

13:39.399 --> 13:40.390
(Object clatters)

13:50.810 --> 13:53.064
The siege of Grozny in '94.

13:53.402 --> 13:56.306
2,000 Russians died fighting their own.

13:56.952 --> 13:58.961
In the aftermath, generals resigned,

13:59.072 --> 14:00.360
others were tried.

14:01.511 --> 14:03.151
But for days, they fought,

14:03.743 --> 14:05.123
brother killing brother

14:05.273 --> 14:07.075
by the thousands in the freezing cold.

14:07.176 --> 14:09.399
And you have to ask yourself why.

14:12.259 --> 14:13.763
Sometimes the enemy

14:13.858 --> 14:16.285
is just the man
keeping you from getting home.

14:23.778 --> 14:25.392
<i>(Man) A symbol of the Cold War,</i>

14:25.522 --> 14:28.175
<i>the Ohio class submarine</i>
<i>is one of 18 in its class</i>

14:28.681 --> 14:29.921
<i>designed to run silent and deep</i>

14:29.922 --> 14:31.002
<i>and then deliver deathly...</i>

14:31.078 --> 14:33.380
20 bucks says we take this guy
out within 24 hours.

14:33.497 --> 14:34.944
Cruise missile. Who's in?

14:35.050 --> 14:36.129
Hey, brain surgeon.

14:36.426 --> 14:37.647
The "Colorado" can launch

14:37.750 --> 14:40.152
its remaining 17 nukes
in under five minutes.

14:40.246 --> 14:41.935
Your cruise missile is a slow weapon.

14:42.037 --> 14:43.076
Takes maybe 20 minutes.

14:43.181 --> 14:45.377
ICBM's faster, but you gotta
launch it up and down.

14:45.488 --> 14:46.234
That takes time.

14:46.369 --> 14:48.210
And you better be 100% sure you kill her,

14:48.309 --> 14:49.637
'cause Chaplin's got eyes now.

14:49.692 --> 14:51.652
And once the "Colorado's"
tridents are airborne,

14:51.653 --> 14:53.693
there is not a thing
in this world that stops them

14:53.694 --> 14:55.854
'cause somebody kept my daddy
from building star wars

14:55.855 --> 14:56.375
20 years ago.

14:56.470 --> 15:00.418
So tell me exactly how you would
take out that submarine?

15:01.125 --> 15:02.447
(Indistinct conversations)

15:02.589 --> 15:03.906
Linus.

15:04.211 --> 15:05.611
What is my favorite deep cover mole

15:05.612 --> 15:07.572
in the Defense Department
drinking this evening?

15:07.675 --> 15:09.115
- For God sake, Kylie.
- Oh, relax.

15:09.293 --> 15:10.853
I could give you a lap dance right here

15:10.854 --> 15:12.054
and no one would notice today.

15:12.183 --> 15:13.190
I would.

15:13.477 --> 15:14.713
(Kylie) So what's your news?

15:15.912 --> 15:17.777
Your Perseus prototype?

15:17.990 --> 15:20.400
Chaplin went ahead and tested it
this morning, on his own.

15:21.080 --> 15:23.830
The "Colorado" dropped
right off everyone's screens.

15:24.075 --> 15:25.805
Kylie, it works.

15:26.175 --> 15:28.412
Waiter, champagne. Right away.
We're celebrating.

15:28.413 --> 15:29.933
No, no, no, no.
You don't understand.

15:29.934 --> 15:31.214
They will take it away from you.

15:31.215 --> 15:33.535
They will go patriot act,
they will go National Security,

15:33.536 --> 15:34.976
and they will take it away from you.

15:34.977 --> 15:36.577
And there's nothing you can do about it.

15:36.978 --> 15:38.378
(Indistinct conversations continue)

15:38.379 --> 15:40.247
Chaplin said it was
actually the "Illinois"

15:40.350 --> 15:41.750
that tried to sink
the "Colorado."

15:41.854 --> 15:42.843
Chaplin's insane.

15:42.954 --> 15:44.741
Really? 24 hours ago,
you would've said

15:44.847 --> 15:47.489
he was the paragon of virtue
and patriotism.

15:47.653 --> 15:49.807
Now someone ordered
the "Illinois" to fire.

15:49.933 --> 15:51.893
Somewhere that was recorded,
and if you're right

15:51.894 --> 15:53.294
and they're trying to take my tech,

15:53.295 --> 15:55.351
than that order is
my get-out-of-jail-free card.

15:55.535 --> 15:56.825
I need you to get that for me.

15:56.919 --> 15:57.839
Are you not hearing me?

15:57.889 --> 15:59.235
I can't help you anymore.

16:01.161 --> 16:04.198
What was the name of that
brunette at your bachelor party?

16:04.693 --> 16:06.025
God, she was hot.

16:06.143 --> 16:07.663
Like,
make-me-want-to-switch-hit hot,

16:07.664 --> 16:08.190
wasn't she?

16:08.285 --> 16:09.675
Was it Carole?

16:10.237 --> 16:12.350
Oh, no. No, no.
That's your wife's name.

16:12.733 --> 16:14.050
I thought we were friends.

16:14.253 --> 16:15.508
We are friends.

16:15.711 --> 16:18.605
But you're a friend I pay
a lot of money to.

16:19.847 --> 16:21.792
Linus, go find me that order.

16:25.834 --> 16:27.136
Good-bye, dad.

16:32.139 --> 16:34.368
I bet this isn't how you saw
your weekend going.

16:34.490 --> 16:37.051
My weekends are not as boring
as you imagine.

16:38.523 --> 16:40.431
Yeah. Well, it isn't
how I saw mine.

16:42.074 --> 16:43.556
I was there.

16:44.495 --> 16:47.898
If you hadn't killed that man,
we'd all be dead.

16:48.532 --> 16:50.308
You didn't have a choice.

16:51.821 --> 16:53.651
It doesn't matter now, does it?

17:00.081 --> 17:01.696
(People speaking indistinctly)

17:02.342 --> 17:04.086
(Chief) Shepard killed one of us.

17:04.200 --> 17:05.217
Sometimes in battle,

17:05.351 --> 17:08.261
these things have a way
of working themselves out.

17:17.742 --> 17:19.422
Sorry, Cam, you're too important up there.

17:19.824 --> 17:20.864
With all due respect, sir.

17:21.010 --> 17:23.050
If this doesn't work,
there will be no "up there."

17:25.502 --> 17:27.652
Full complement ready to go, sir.

17:27.752 --> 17:28.790
Good.

17:31.355 --> 17:33.684
Careful out there.
Don't get a sunburn.

17:37.734 --> 17:40.563
You don't need this or this or this.

17:41.138 --> 17:41.987
Hey.

17:43.120 --> 17:44.000
This will get you shot

17:44.001 --> 17:45.561
while you're busy trying to unstrap it.

17:48.731 --> 17:50.703
You got your rig strapped right.

17:51.104 --> 17:53.024
Doesn't mean you're ready
for what's out there.

18:03.987 --> 18:06.575
There is a place they will
have to go through to get here.

18:07.367 --> 18:08.554
I'll show you where.

18:09.890 --> 18:11.306
That's all.

18:11.920 --> 18:14.247
(Man) Aiding and abetting
a terrorist enterprise,

18:14.352 --> 18:16.129
aiding and abetting known terrorists,

18:16.240 --> 18:17.384
sedition, treason,

18:17.485 --> 18:19.688
aiding and abetting
an attack on the homeland...

18:19.782 --> 18:21.102
and this isn't just your husband.

18:21.217 --> 18:23.456
After that stunt, this is now you as well.

18:25.020 --> 18:26.881
Read between the lines.

18:27.012 --> 18:28.313
You think you know him?

18:28.411 --> 18:29.696
You don't.

18:30.354 --> 18:31.853
You just know the easy parts,

18:32.578 --> 18:34.245
the parts he wanted you to see.

18:34.357 --> 18:36.033
I know Sam better than anyone.

18:36.280 --> 18:37.365
You sure?
(Clicks)

18:38.138 --> 18:39.338
<i>I'm not gonna talk about that.</i>

18:39.406 --> 18:40.926
<i>I told you I'm not gonna talk about it</i>

18:40.927 --> 18:42.127
<i>so we're not talking about it.</i>

18:42.128 --> 18:42.648
What is this?

18:42.736 --> 18:44.808
<i>(Woman) There were 18 of you</i>
<i>taken prisoner.</i>

18:44.916 --> 18:46.572
When was this taken?
What is this?

18:46.666 --> 18:48.638
<i>Seven men under your command</i>
<i>didn't survive.</i>

18:48.729 --> 18:50.125
What the hell is going on?

18:50.223 --> 18:51.645
<i>That has to weigh on you.</i>

18:56.507 --> 18:57.964
I was surprised you showed.

18:58.459 --> 18:59.859
So am I.

19:01.369 --> 19:02.910
These men you're ready to fight,

19:03.258 --> 19:04.963
they might as well be your brothers.

19:06.145 --> 19:07.310
Hey, you know, I get it.

19:07.877 --> 19:09.637
You don't like killing,
you don't like war,

19:09.638 --> 19:11.373
you want us to all just get along.

19:12.056 --> 19:13.096
That's what anybody thinks

19:13.097 --> 19:14.977
that's never had their back
up against a wall.

19:15.058 --> 19:16.625
Who do you think I am?

19:17.282 --> 19:18.798
I've seen what your wars do.

19:19.072 --> 19:20.535
And there's always some other way.

19:20.653 --> 19:22.164
Yeah, I used to think that, too.

19:22.707 --> 19:23.888
I was wrong.

19:24.645 --> 19:26.258
What happened to change your mind?

19:27.995 --> 19:29.540
Thank you for showing us this spot.

19:29.654 --> 19:31.018
You should go now.

19:39.435 --> 19:40.469
Ma'am.

19:40.567 --> 19:41.913
Can you check my weapon for me?

19:42.116 --> 19:43.434
I want to make sure it's ready.

19:51.003 --> 19:52.090
Thank you, ma'am.

19:52.428 --> 19:53.882
I feel much safer now.

20:01.816 --> 20:03.775
(People speaking indistinctly)

20:06.271 --> 20:08.643
You just let them go off alone.

20:09.602 --> 20:11.329
Ahh.
It's not my business.

20:14.855 --> 20:16.624
Here on Sainte Marina,

20:17.075 --> 20:19.604
sometimes a family breaks apart...

20:19.722 --> 20:22.042
a marriage goes bad, a debt goes unpaid,

20:22.333 --> 20:23.810
a small war starts.

20:24.607 --> 20:27.187
Don't worry. I'm not gonna
break out the patchouli.

20:27.912 --> 20:30.033
But here when this happens,

20:30.153 --> 20:32.196
a man is selected and marked

20:32.728 --> 20:34.119
to make the peace.

20:34.875 --> 20:36.857
The marks are an honor.

20:39.194 --> 20:40.975
Do you deserve them?

20:46.018 --> 20:47.618
<i>It would be 3:00 or 4:00</i>
<i>in the morning</i>

20:47.619 --> 20:48.459
<i>when they would come.</i>

20:48.505 --> 20:49.785
<i>They'd drag us out of our cells.</i>

20:49.908 --> 20:51.431
<i>They would march us out into the yard.</i>

20:51.533 --> 20:52.582
<i>(Woman) Together?</i>

20:53.061 --> 20:54.589
<i>Mnh-mnh. Alone.</i>

20:54.845 --> 20:57.825
<i>There would be a table</i>
<i>and gun. One bullet.</i>

20:57.954 --> 20:59.277
<i>They'd make you load the gun.</i>

20:59.895 --> 21:02.055
<i>They'd spin the chamber</i>
<i>and put the gun to your head.</i>

21:03.604 --> 21:04.939
<i>Click.</i>

21:05.660 --> 21:07.418
<i>That sound...</i>
(Remote beeps)

21:07.527 --> 21:09.245
Your husband was a captive

21:09.363 --> 21:11.715
of the Democratic People's
Republic of North Korea

21:11.829 --> 21:13.305
for over 17 days.

21:13.703 --> 21:14.777
No, that's not possible.

21:14.875 --> 21:16.718
Marcus Chaplin went off the reservation

21:16.801 --> 21:18.139
to force his release.

21:18.249 --> 21:19.929
Put his career on the line.

21:20.066 --> 21:22.183
Sam just tell you that was
a regular deployment?

21:22.699 --> 21:25.302
Why does a man <i>lie</i> to his wife?

21:25.778 --> 21:26.675
I don't know.

21:26.779 --> 21:28.139
Well, Marcus had him lying to you,

21:28.176 --> 21:29.305
to everyone.

21:29.436 --> 21:30.884
And if he's capable of that,

21:31.269 --> 21:33.268
what else could Marcus get him to do?

21:33.487 --> 21:36.825
You think that's the only lie
your husband ever told you?

21:36.924 --> 21:38.410
I don't know, okay?

21:39.442 --> 21:42.326
Why don't you tell me? Because I
don't know what this is.

21:43.650 --> 21:44.600
(Beeps)

21:44.707 --> 21:46.763
<i>I lost seven of my men.</i>
<i>You want their names?</i>

21:47.619 --> 21:50.431
<i>Look, it happened. I'm over it.</i>
<i>Could we move on, please?</i>

21:50.966 --> 21:52.397
(Man) That's your husband...

21:52.745 --> 21:54.091
learning to lie.

21:58.156 --> 22:00.190
Deputy Secretary of Defense Curry,

22:00.317 --> 22:01.580
it's good to talk to you again.

22:01.898 --> 22:03.947
It's Secretary now, Captain.

22:04.520 --> 22:07.403
Well, I'm glad the last 24 hours
has been good to someone.

22:07.513 --> 22:09.553
You know, we have a lot
of frightened people here.

22:09.554 --> 22:11.074
You have a team of Delta on my island.

22:11.085 --> 22:12.476
I want them gone. Now.

22:12.587 --> 22:15.680
We got about 1.6 billion muslims
deeply pissed at us.

22:15.776 --> 22:17.536
We're trying to de-escalate
this situation,

22:17.537 --> 22:18.269
not make it worse.

22:18.340 --> 22:21.621
There are no Delta
on your island. Over.

22:24.628 --> 22:26.093
So who can shoot?

22:26.660 --> 22:28.206
I mean actually hit something.

22:28.721 --> 22:30.141
I suppose I can.

22:30.503 --> 22:31.441
Okay.

22:31.720 --> 22:34.519
Ah, hell.
Guess I can, too.

22:34.633 --> 22:35.798
Good.

22:36.044 --> 22:38.004
When this starts,
they're either gonna fall back

22:38.005 --> 22:39.960
or try to make it to cover.

22:40.639 --> 22:42.027
You do not let them.

22:42.282 --> 22:43.348
You got it?

22:44.299 --> 22:44.911
Good.

22:44.912 --> 22:46.352
(Shepard) XO, we're all set up here.

22:46.461 --> 22:47.661
How long do you think we have?

22:47.750 --> 22:49.710
(Kendal) Probably an hour
or more, but be ready.

22:49.711 --> 22:50.483
(Radio clicks)

22:51.332 --> 22:53.078
Must feel weird, killing one of your own,

22:53.829 --> 22:56.238
especially like this, without
them knowing it's coming.

22:57.011 --> 22:58.191
Hey, Hawkes,

22:59.124 --> 23:00.987
we're gonna need every gun we have.

23:01.104 --> 23:02.704
So if you're gonna shoot me in the back,

23:02.705 --> 23:04.465
maybe you could wait
until we're done here.

23:11.796 --> 23:13.116
We've got the whole thing ranged.

23:13.138 --> 23:14.372
If they come, we'll take 'em.

23:14.980 --> 23:15.852
Good.

23:16.064 --> 23:17.257
XO...

23:18.702 --> 23:20.554
You gonna get married someday, Lieutenant?

23:21.471 --> 23:22.591
'Cause these men are coming,

23:22.592 --> 23:24.272
and only one of you gets to have a future.

23:25.259 --> 23:26.659
I plan on being at that wedding.

23:27.752 --> 23:29.152
I'll make sure and invite you, sir.

23:29.490 --> 23:30.400
(Whistling)

23:30.479 --> 23:32.039
(Kendal, lowered voice)
Go, quick. Go.

23:41.180 --> 23:42.060
Captain, they're here.

23:42.061 --> 23:44.621
If we're gonna find another way
out of this, it's gotta be now.

23:44.622 --> 23:45.902
You're on your own for now, Sam.

23:45.903 --> 23:46.743
I can't help you yet.

23:49.982 --> 23:50.594
(Exhales)

23:51.655 --> 23:52.493
(Blows air)

23:52.978 --> 23:53.911
(Blows air)

23:56.454 --> 23:57.720
Secretary Curry,

23:57.891 --> 24:00.084
tell me again how you have
nothing on my island.

24:00.171 --> 24:02.277
Tell me how I'm imaging
my XO is going up against

24:02.392 --> 24:03.632
an armed contingent.
(Beeping)

24:03.633 --> 24:05.953
And if I think you're lying
to me, then I'm gonna have to

24:05.954 --> 24:08.474
- leave this in the hands of a higher power.
- Excuse me, sir.

24:08.475 --> 24:10.035
Wh-what do you want me
to say, Marcus?

24:10.141 --> 24:12.162
Yes, we sent Delta?
No, we didn't send Delta?

24:12.273 --> 24:14.065
Does it really matter what I say?

24:14.939 --> 24:16.715
(Pants) Hold your fire.

24:17.346 --> 24:19.302
(Panting)

24:21.413 --> 24:23.046
Hold your fire.

24:23.367 --> 24:24.175
(Man) Sir?

24:24.276 --> 24:25.486
I have the shot.

24:25.699 --> 24:26.735
Sir?

24:31.511 --> 24:34.802
I'm coming out to talk!
I am unarmed!

24:34.908 --> 24:37.269
I repeat, I am unarmed!
I'm coming out to talk!

24:37.589 --> 24:38.636
Do not fire!

24:38.746 --> 24:40.854
Sir...
What are you doing?

24:49.945 --> 24:52.074
We got you ranged from both sides.

24:52.712 --> 24:54.319
You are in a kill zone.

24:56.466 --> 24:58.028
I just want to talk.

25:00.368 --> 25:02.739
We are all Americans.
At least some of you

25:02.839 --> 25:04.825
gotta be wondering what you're doing here.

25:04.984 --> 25:06.807
Hell. I don't even know
what I'm doing here.

25:07.329 --> 25:08.698
(Whispers indistinctly)

25:09.356 --> 25:10.476
(Beeping) There it is again.

25:10.477 --> 25:12.437
They're essentially
beaming it through the water

25:12.438 --> 25:13.518
from their base to the team

25:13.519 --> 25:15.079
and then using
an ultra-low frequency.

25:15.080 --> 25:16.968
Who is beaming it through the water?

25:17.543 --> 25:18.721
(Beeping continues) They are.

25:21.168 --> 25:24.003
All I know is,
none of us has to die today.

25:24.730 --> 25:26.100
(Chaplin) Sam, they're not Deltas.

25:26.207 --> 25:27.440
They're Russian <i>Spetsnaz.</i>

25:27.562 --> 25:28.651
Sam, do you read?

25:29.685 --> 25:30.875
Ah, hell.

25:31.967 --> 25:33.089
(Booms)

25:33.911 --> 25:34.957
(Gunfire)

25:44.595 --> 25:46.035
(Man) Three went back!
Two forward!

25:46.139 --> 25:47.294
We got two but... (Grunts)

25:52.220 --> 25:54.500
Grace, they flanked us to
the top of the hill you're on.

25:54.601 --> 25:55.814
You gotta get up there.

25:56.657 --> 25:57.723
(Gunfire continues)

25:57.864 --> 25:58.622
(Grunts)

25:59.077 --> 26:00.419
We're already on our way.

26:00.679 --> 26:02.173
But we're pinned down, Sam.

26:02.810 --> 26:04.117
There is no way up.

26:04.247 --> 26:06.487
(Kendal) We're not gonna survive
like this, Lieutenant.

26:06.488 --> 26:07.968
I need you to take that position out.

26:07.969 --> 26:08.624
Do you hear me?

26:09.169 --> 26:10.153
(Gunfire continues)

26:11.679 --> 26:12.729
Hawkes.

26:12.877 --> 26:14.213
Hawkes, we need cover.

26:14.834 --> 26:16.045
(Gunfire continues)

26:16.263 --> 26:17.435
No!

26:18.134 --> 26:19.629
(Gunfire continues)

26:26.239 --> 26:27.238
Turn that down, sailor.

26:27.332 --> 26:28.235
Sir?

26:28.333 --> 26:29.721
You heard me.
Turn it down.

26:30.564 --> 26:31.838
(Gunfire sounding over radio)

26:32.758 --> 26:34.122
<i>Marcus Chaplin.</i>

26:35.059 --> 26:37.032
<i>This is an unexpected honor.</i>

26:37.152 --> 26:39.152
Viktor, you have a team
of <i>Spetsnaz</i> on my island,

26:39.310 --> 26:41.650
dropped off the back of a Taiwanese 747.

26:41.811 --> 26:43.971
You're running support off
a Ukrainian container ship

26:43.972 --> 26:45.663
50 miles beyond my perimeter.

26:45.757 --> 26:47.397
And it might not be your mission, Viktor.

26:47.398 --> 26:50.599
But someone in the Kremlin is
making a play for my submarine.

26:51.141 --> 26:52.517
<i>No one would want to attack.</i>

26:52.607 --> 26:53.810
I'll sink the ship, Viktor.

26:53.957 --> 26:55.663
And then I'll target the Sevastopol base

26:55.782 --> 26:57.451
where your two sons are stationed

26:58.285 --> 27:00.113
and I'll turn it to glass.

27:08.312 --> 27:09.428
(Gunfire)

27:09.823 --> 27:11.339
Grace, I need to know right now,

27:11.446 --> 27:13.504
can you take care
of that position or not?!

27:14.059 --> 27:14.819
(Gunfire continues)

27:14.841 --> 27:16.067
I'm sorry, Sam.

27:17.171 --> 27:18.148
I'm sorry.

27:18.258 --> 27:20.218
(Man) Russians are signaling,
they want to talk.

27:20.219 --> 27:21.380
Get Curry back on the line.

27:21.501 --> 27:23.707
Let him hear everything,
but mute that son of a bitch.

27:24.405 --> 27:25.885
(Gunfire sounding faintly over radio)

27:29.331 --> 27:30.648
<i>Marcus,</i>

27:31.270 --> 27:33.012
<i>many people are asleep here.</i>

27:33.965 --> 27:34.938
<i>It's not easy.</i>

27:35.054 --> 27:36.362
That's okay, Viktor.

27:36.968 --> 27:38.569
I've got all the time in the world.

27:39.143 --> 27:39.503
(Gunfire)

27:39.565 --> 27:41.226
Radio's dead.
Everybody listen up.

27:41.359 --> 27:42.919
On my go, you're gonna get to the truck

27:42.920 --> 27:44.303
and get the hell out of here.

27:44.401 --> 27:46.353
One of you guys go down,
you just keep moving.

27:46.498 --> 27:47.399
On my go.

27:48.625 --> 27:50.444
Red. Red.

27:50.543 --> 27:52.023
We're gonna do this.
Do you hear me?

27:52.024 --> 27:54.433
It's not more than 25 yards.
Do you understand me?

27:54.543 --> 27:55.952
I can't. I can't.

27:56.069 --> 27:56.965
(Panting)

27:57.074 --> 27:58.979
I'm sorry. I can't.

27:59.512 --> 28:00.611
(Gunfire continues)

28:01.936 --> 28:03.519
Viktor, what is that kid's name...

28:04.507 --> 28:05.793
on your boat back in the day?

28:05.903 --> 28:07.743
The one who got so freaked out
under the ice.

28:08.948 --> 28:10.788
You and I called off
the Cold War for an hour

28:10.789 --> 28:12.127
so you could get him topside.

28:13.117 --> 28:14.423
That's called trust.

28:14.543 --> 28:15.992
<i>Ah, Nikolai.</i>

28:16.096 --> 28:17.395
<i>Admiral's son.</i>

28:19.310 --> 28:20.362
<i>Marcus,</i>

28:20.473 --> 28:22.511
<i>just between two old warriors,</i>

28:23.652 --> 28:27.537
<i>let's say for argument's sake</i>
<i>we had our people there.</i>

28:28.573 --> 28:30.276
<i>Maybe you could surrender your submarine.</i>

28:30.548 --> 28:32.519
<i>Maybe then nobody would have to be hurt.</i>

28:33.173 --> 28:33.905
(Snaps)

28:34.003 --> 28:36.013
Viktor! This is
Secretary of Defense Curry.

28:36.125 --> 28:38.588
You put a play in motion?
This is our conflict.

28:38.691 --> 28:40.509
Unless you want to start World War III,

28:40.622 --> 28:42.173
you pull those men back <i>now.</i>

28:42.391 --> 28:44.071
<i>And I thought you were a man of your word.</i>

28:44.072 --> 28:45.595
I didn't give you my word, Viktor.

28:45.762 --> 28:47.522
But I'll let you work out
the ramifications

28:47.523 --> 28:50.002
of trying to steal a U.S. sub
with SecDef Curry.

28:52.324 --> 28:52.830
(Gunfire)

28:52.944 --> 28:54.209
I did the math.

28:54.308 --> 28:56.521
We dated two years.
Married one.

28:56.660 --> 28:57.262
Mm-hmm.

28:57.361 --> 29:01.750
Yet, we have actually
only spent 124 days together.

29:01.897 --> 29:02.660
(Chuckles)

29:02.759 --> 29:03.846
You did the math?

29:03.930 --> 29:06.393
Who are you, Sam Kendal?

29:06.513 --> 29:07.746
We're gonna be okay.

29:07.836 --> 29:08.932
What do you want?

29:09.033 --> 29:10.323
I just want you.

29:10.656 --> 29:11.718
<i>(Cameron) XO.</i>

29:11.901 --> 29:12.885
XO!

29:13.450 --> 29:14.560
You don't have to do this.

29:15.040 --> 29:16.532
(Lowered voice) Go, go, go, go!

29:17.362 --> 29:18.387
(Gunfire)

29:21.178 --> 29:22.945
Don't die. Not today.

29:23.061 --> 29:24.192
Don't die.

29:27.280 --> 29:28.171
(Bullet whizzes)

29:28.631 --> 29:29.660
(Gunfire continues)

29:29.789 --> 29:31.301
(Gunshot) (Grunts)

29:33.052 --> 29:34.059
(Gunshot)

29:34.614 --> 29:35.541
(Gunshot)

29:41.739 --> 29:42.592
(Gunshot)

29:47.361 --> 29:49.653
Yeah!

29:55.039 --> 29:56.522
(Panting)

30:07.402 --> 30:08.811
XO, are you there?

30:08.969 --> 30:09.662
(Radio clicks)

30:12.097 --> 30:13.362
XO.

30:13.831 --> 30:14.164
(Click)

30:14.369 --> 30:16.169
(Kendal) Remaining Russians
have bugged out.

30:17.007 --> 30:19.040
We lost five.
Grace is wounded.

30:19.140 --> 30:20.345
But she's gonna be okay.

30:20.881 --> 30:22.561
We have two prisoners.
We're coming home.

30:24.202 --> 30:25.355
(Radio clatters)

30:28.591 --> 30:30.174
Probably a waste of time.

30:30.278 --> 30:32.438
You really think you can break
that kind of devotion?

30:33.500 --> 30:36.319
Well, she's got faith.
She's in love.

30:37.192 --> 30:38.688
But both those things are curable.

30:39.165 --> 30:40.871
Then cure her.

30:48.235 --> 30:49.235
(Video playing inaudibly)

30:49.236 --> 30:50.423
Okay, I'm here with her now.

30:50.587 --> 30:51.478
All right.

30:52.636 --> 30:53.887
Christine...

30:54.316 --> 30:55.645
My name is Paul Wells.

30:56.173 --> 30:57.416
We've been trying to find you.

30:58.084 --> 30:59.768
Do you remember me?

31:05.922 --> 31:07.242
You're Sam's friend.

31:07.333 --> 31:08.787
Yes. Yes, from college.

31:08.889 --> 31:09.963
Look, I'm a lawyer, okay?

31:10.051 --> 31:11.295
The government has...

31:11.465 --> 31:14.034
radically exceeded its authority here.

31:14.649 --> 31:16.121
But that all stops now.

31:19.062 --> 31:20.346
Come on.

31:20.596 --> 31:22.465
Let me take you home.

31:32.257 --> 31:34.731
(Video continues playing inaudibly)

31:52.195 --> 31:53.217
All right, lock 'em up.

31:53.310 --> 31:54.575
Oh, hell, no.

31:54.908 --> 31:56.508
They killed five of us, man.

31:56.687 --> 31:57.480
(Woman) Yeah, five.

31:57.578 --> 31:59.178
Five of our friends, five of our people.

31:59.179 --> 32:00.561
These guys get wasted.

32:00.643 --> 32:02.723
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Put your weapon down right now!

32:02.724 --> 32:04.243
Red, that is an order!
Put it down!

32:04.338 --> 32:06.138
An order? We're on
a damn island, not a sub.

32:06.200 --> 32:07.153
So excuse me

32:07.332 --> 32:09.514
if I'm not even sure
what an order means anymore!

32:12.040 --> 32:13.791
I know you didn't ask for this.

32:15.394 --> 32:17.028
I know you're all scared

32:17.029 --> 32:18.709
and you're wondering what we're doing here

32:18.809 --> 32:20.241
and how you're gonna get back home.

32:21.067 --> 32:22.147
And now you've lost friends

32:22.148 --> 32:24.099
and you have bloodlust in your hearts.

32:24.647 --> 32:26.407
Vengeance might give you
some satisfaction,

32:26.408 --> 32:29.511
but let me remind you <i>who you are.</i>

32:31.459 --> 32:32.930
You are the American crew

32:34.053 --> 32:37.232
of the Ohio class ballistic
missile submarine "Colorado."

32:37.584 --> 32:39.356
Your rank is what it says on your collar.

32:39.459 --> 32:40.869
You salute the sailor above you...

32:42.281 --> 32:44.310
and you expect the same of the one below.

32:44.416 --> 32:46.096
And your final duty
is to say "how high?"

32:46.097 --> 32:47.340
When I say "jump."

32:48.220 --> 32:49.558
Are we clear?

32:49.818 --> 32:51.947
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

32:52.076 --> 32:53.142
Are we clear?!

32:53.241 --> 32:54.673
(Crew) Yes, sir.

32:57.068 --> 32:58.409
Now as Americans,

33:00.265 --> 33:02.600
there's no debate about
the fate of our POWs.

33:04.398 --> 33:05.607
Lieutenant Shepard,

33:06.306 --> 33:07.609
secure the prisoners.

33:15.808 --> 33:17.292
(Chain link rattling)

33:27.239 --> 33:28.973
I know what you did.

33:30.027 --> 33:32.338
Try it again.
I'll still be here.

33:39.281 --> 33:40.813
Marcus!

33:41.468 --> 33:44.382
Tell them what you told me
when we were still pals.

33:46.116 --> 33:48.605
Tell them that your son
got killed by friendly fire

33:48.724 --> 33:51.195
two weeks ago in Afghanistan.

33:53.914 --> 33:55.456
Go on.

33:55.581 --> 33:57.541
These young people
have followed you into a hell

33:57.542 --> 33:59.853
they'll never be able
to climb back out of.

34:00.568 --> 34:01.750
For what?

34:01.863 --> 34:03.503
Because you wanted payback on the country

34:03.525 --> 34:05.625
that took your son away from you?!

34:06.684 --> 34:08.668
Tell 'em the truth, Marcus!

34:09.264 --> 34:11.536
Tell them what they're really
fighting for!

34:12.966 --> 34:14.645
You know me, Joe.

34:19.609 --> 34:21.353
All of you...

34:21.813 --> 34:23.094
you know me.

34:54.080 --> 34:54.886
One more for me.

34:54.987 --> 34:57.594
One more for the lady with the, uh, face.

34:59.168 --> 35:01.014
You think I came to thank you?

35:02.001 --> 35:03.269
We lost people.

35:03.905 --> 35:05.745
I thought you might want
to know their names.

35:08.645 --> 35:10.986
I got my own list a lot longer than that.

35:14.434 --> 35:16.314
One of these days,
you're gonna have to decide

35:16.315 --> 35:17.616
what you believe in.

35:19.205 --> 35:20.228
(Glass thuds)

35:20.741 --> 35:21.781
Ahh.

35:22.294 --> 35:24.030
What did it feel like?

35:25.712 --> 35:27.662
It's a hell of a buzz, isn't it?

35:30.497 --> 35:33.613
You may not know it,
but you did something today.

35:34.028 --> 35:35.105
Peace...

35:35.209 --> 35:36.850
maker.

35:36.956 --> 35:38.950
You think I made the peace, Tani?

35:40.465 --> 35:42.431
I just ran out of people to kill.

35:43.033 --> 35:44.753
<i>(Man) The so-called</i>
<i>"Pledge of Allegiance"</i>

35:44.754 --> 35:45.874
<i>swept through congress today</i>

35:45.875 --> 35:48.205
<i>as legislators lined up</i>
<i>in support of the President,</i>

35:48.341 --> 35:50.050
<i>even as international condemnation mounts</i>

35:50.159 --> 35:50.866
<i>for the attack</i>

35:50.951 --> 35:53.591
<i>the White House has called</i>
<i>"necessary and unavoidable."</i>

35:53.936 --> 35:54.993
(Cell phone rings)

35:56.065 --> 35:57.307
Oh, finally.

35:58.049 --> 35:59.579
I did my part. How about...

36:04.209 --> 36:06.549
(Monitor beeping rhythmically)

36:07.985 --> 36:10.848
They said it was an allergic
reaction to something he ate.

36:10.950 --> 36:12.230
But by the time they got to him,

36:12.231 --> 36:15.243
his brain had been without
oxygen for ten minutes.

36:15.493 --> 36:17.158
So how could that be an accident?

36:18.585 --> 36:20.323
It's your fault, isn't it?

36:22.795 --> 36:25.712
You smiled and promised him so much money.

36:26.052 --> 36:27.932
You know, he used to say,
"You should see her.

36:28.282 --> 36:30.139
It's like nothing
can touch her."

36:30.355 --> 36:32.270
It's true, isn't it?
Nothing touches you.

36:32.835 --> 36:34.270
(Beeping continues)

36:36.213 --> 36:38.291
I hope you die alone.

36:39.038 --> 36:40.257
(Beeping continues)

36:48.028 --> 36:50.318
(Footsteps approaching)

36:55.200 --> 36:56.593
(Clears throat)

36:58.095 --> 37:00.735
We've got two teams looking
for Brannan and Cortez.

37:02.319 --> 37:04.666
If they're out there
to be found, we'll find them.

37:12.930 --> 37:14.397
I think it was July deployment.

37:15.809 --> 37:17.649
You're due any minute
for general inspection,

37:17.650 --> 37:19.090
and, man... (Laughs)

37:19.888 --> 37:21.272
It's not good.

37:21.434 --> 37:23.868
Cam's got some new sonar display
that's not even working.

37:23.964 --> 37:25.644
The cook, he's got, like, 200 cans of stew

37:25.692 --> 37:26.874
that exploded in the mess

37:26.954 --> 37:28.011
and the smell...

37:29.355 --> 37:31.101
The smell is everywhere.

37:31.938 --> 37:33.813
And here comes the captain.
Here you come.

37:34.046 --> 37:35.006
Everybody's freaking out

37:35.007 --> 37:36.647
because the place is a complete disaster.

37:36.716 --> 37:37.916
Except instead, for two hours,

37:38.721 --> 37:40.841
you're all smiles and back slaps.

37:41.763 --> 37:44.576
(Laughs) You told some story
about fishing off the back

37:44.683 --> 37:46.524
of an LA class attack sub.

37:46.650 --> 37:47.814
(Laughs)

37:49.880 --> 37:51.773
Finally, it's time to put to sea.

37:52.301 --> 37:54.683
I find Christine
and I say good-bye.

37:55.626 --> 37:57.287
Yeah, you'd been married...

37:58.025 --> 37:59.347
three weeks?

38:01.190 --> 38:02.640
I join you on the bridge,

38:04.030 --> 38:07.688
and you got this big dumb smile
plastered all over your face...

38:08.744 --> 38:10.724
totally undignified.

38:14.919 --> 38:17.991
(Sighs) And Jeffrey's there on the pier.

38:19.821 --> 38:21.954
He's home from his first tour.

38:22.512 --> 38:24.923
He's there to watch his old man
pull out to sea.

38:39.148 --> 38:41.167
Give me your dumb hand, sir.

38:43.369 --> 38:45.690
I can't imagine what you're going through.

38:49.673 --> 38:51.878
But I am your friend.

38:52.000 --> 38:54.179
And I know who you are.

38:57.703 --> 38:59.367
And I trust you.

39:04.508 --> 39:05.842
They find what hurts you the most

39:05.947 --> 39:08.001
and they try to break you with it.

39:08.406 --> 39:10.343
But that's where they miss.

39:11.411 --> 39:13.565
What hurts us the most,
that's our strength.

39:13.667 --> 39:15.888
That's what gets us through.

39:57.028 --> 39:57.970
<i>(Jeffrey) I'm excited.</i>

39:58.082 --> 40:00.253
<i>And I know you of all people,</i>
<i>you get that.</i>

40:00.670 --> 40:02.386
<i>I'll tell you stories on the other side.</i>

40:03.271 --> 40:04.625
<i>I love you, dad.</i>

40:06.429 --> 40:07.439
<i>(Grace) Hi, dad.</i>

40:07.536 --> 40:09.425
<i>I hope you never have to watch this.</i>

40:09.521 --> 40:11.507
<i>I wish that I had let you know me better.</i>

40:11.749 --> 40:14.254
<i>If I had, then you would know</i>
<i>how scared I am.</i>

40:17.258 --> 40:19.862
<i>But you would also know that</i>
<i>I'm not gonna run from this.</i>

40:23.029 --> 40:24.590
<i>That's not who I am.</i>

40:29.366 --> 40:31.001
<i>I love you, dad.</i>

40:33.964 --> 40:36.142
(Clattering)

40:36.159 --> 40:37.319
<i>(Woman) You've indicated that</i>

40:37.320 --> 40:39.200
<i>you're not going to tell</i>
<i>your wife about this.</i>

40:39.201 --> 40:40.080
<i>Why is that?</i>

40:40.176 --> 40:42.706
<i>The whole time I was there,</i>
<i>Christine's what kept me alive.</i>

40:43.911 --> 40:46.180
<i>You want to know why</i>
<i>I'm not gonna tell my wife?</i>

40:48.176 --> 40:50.496
<i>'Cause she's the one good thing</i>
<i>I got left in this world.</i>

40:50.497 --> 40:52.132
<i>Maybe this way, I get to keep that.</i>

40:55.081 --> 40:57.742
