Tatjana.

00:28.271 --> 00:30.035

00:32.330 --> 00:33.542
_

00:35.093 --> 00:36.226
Where are your bags?

00:36.260 --> 00:38.843
- Yura, I'm scared.
- We already talked about this.

00:38.963 --> 00:41.179
No, I'm really scared.
Aren't you scared?

00:41.299 --> 00:42.833
Let's talk about this in the car.

00:42.867 --> 00:44.234
We really must rush.

00:44.268 --> 00:46.970
My husband is going to kill me.

00:47.004 --> 00:48.238
He's going to kill us.

00:48.272 --> 00:50.474
Once we're gone, there's nothing,

00:50.508 --> 00:52.809
absolutely nothing that he can do to us.

00:52.844 --> 00:54.478
He's a Colonel in the SVR,

00:54.512 --> 00:56.279
a trained assassin.

00:56.314 --> 00:59.750
For god's sake, you think
he's going to just let us go?

00:59.784 --> 01:01.695
The CIA will protect us. Trust me.

01:01.815 --> 01:05.087
We're going to be safe in United States.

01:05.123 --> 01:07.090
Believe me, we're going
to be in a lot of danger

01:07.125 --> 01:08.792
if we stay here in Russia.

01:11.529 --> 01:14.231
I can't do this, Yura.

01:15.800 --> 01:16.969
Not today.

01:17.802 --> 01:20.504
What? What do you mean "not today"?

01:20.538 --> 01:23.240
I shouldn't even be here right now.

01:36.401 --> 01:39.421
_

01:53.237 --> 01:54.878
Where is he?

01:55.606 --> 01:56.873
_

02:00.178 --> 02:02.879
_

02:15.960 --> 02:17.994

_

02:31.836 --> 02:33.323
_

02:37.485 --> 02:39.182
You might have a point.

02:39.217 --> 02:40.917
About what?

02:40.952 --> 02:42.252
This not being right.

02:47.658 --> 02:49.388
Get away from the window.

02:52.964 --> 02:56.314
We can't get taken. Not with
what we know about Yuri.

02:56.434 --> 02:58.201
What if it's Yuri who set us up?

02:58.236 --> 02:59.936
You are surrounded!

02:59.971 --> 03:01.938
We know you are CIA!

03:02.058 --> 03:05.289
There's no escape! You have
30 seconds to surrender!

03:05.409 --> 03:06.910
But what if it wasn't him?

03:06.944 --> 03:09.045
How else did this happen?

03:09.080 --> 03:10.668
What if they've already rolled Yuri up?

03:10.788 --> 03:13.030
- What if, what if?
- Do you really want to die?

03:13.150 --> 03:14.951
If Yuri's still a live Asset.

03:15.071 --> 03:17.709
- You want to die.
- We have to protect him.

03:17.829 --> 03:19.222
Don't do this.

03:19.257 --> 03:20.637
Please?

03:20.757 --> 03:21.988
Joan.

03:23.461 --> 03:26.096
There has to be another way out of this.

03:26.130 --> 03:27.524
Five!

03:28.232 --> 03:29.966
Four!

03:30.001 --> 03:32.155
- God, I hope you're right.
- Three!

03:32.937 --> 03:34.771
Two!

03:51.489 --> 03:53.824
I can't do this. I'm sorry.

04:06.871 --> 04:08.853
Hey, who got... Who's on shorty?

04:08.973 --> 04:10.426
Remi, you sleeping again?

04:18.048 --> 04:20.250
- Hey.
- Come on.

04:20.284 --> 04:21.785
What the hell was that?

04:21.819 --> 04:22.853
Ho, ho, ho.

04:22.887 --> 04:24.755
Easy, boys. Easy, boys.

04:24.875 --> 04:26.957
- It's just a game.
- What's up with you? You hurt?

04:26.991 --> 04:29.092
We all just having a
good time here, right?

04:29.127 --> 04:30.260
Right.

04:31.445 --> 04:34.131
Please say your name and job title.

04:34.165 --> 04:37.834
Uh, Gretchen Lareau,
Deputy Chief Moscow Station.

04:37.869 --> 04:39.606
Do you understand, Miss Lareau,

04:39.726 --> 04:42.171
that the proceedings of this
chamber are classified secret?

04:42.291 --> 04:43.507
I do.

04:43.541 --> 04:44.941
Miss Lareau, did the two

04:44.976 --> 04:46.977
CIA case officers killed in Russia

04:47.011 --> 04:49.012
earlier this morning report to you?

04:49.561 --> 04:51.114
Yes, they did.

04:51.234 --> 04:53.197
And what were they doing in...

04:53.819 --> 04:54.951
Keykino.

04:55.071 --> 04:57.253
They were supposed to
be meeting an Asset

04:57.288 --> 04:59.322
who had asked for our help
to get him out of Russia.

04:59.357 --> 05:00.465
An Asset?

05:00.585 --> 05:03.426
From the SVR, Russia's
Intelligence Service.

05:03.461 --> 05:04.728
Yuri.

05:04.762 --> 05:06.329
He wanted to defect?

05:06.364 --> 05:07.440
Correct.

05:09.567 --> 05:11.735
And what is Yuri's particular value?

05:11.769 --> 05:13.737
He claims to know the
identity and allegiance

05:13.771 --> 05:16.339
of over 300 Russian agents
in the United States.

05:16.374 --> 05:18.923
- And who recruited him to defect?
- I did.

05:19.043 --> 05:20.210
For how long?

05:20.244 --> 05:22.112
The last 14 months.

05:22.146 --> 05:23.747
- So why...
- I'm sorry.

05:23.781 --> 05:27.083
So why weren't you in
Keykino to meet him?

05:27.118 --> 05:28.518
Because I was back in Langley

05:28.552 --> 05:30.520
for a Divisional Directors meeting.

05:30.554 --> 05:32.455
You scheduled this extraction

05:32.490 --> 05:34.791
while you knew you'd be back in D.C.?

05:34.825 --> 05:37.360
Yuri was familiar with
Pulowski and McFaddyen.

05:37.395 --> 05:39.062
They had his full confidence.

05:39.096 --> 05:40.497
Or so you thought.

05:41.798 --> 05:44.242
Is it possible Yuri set them up?

05:45.403 --> 05:46.603
Miss Lareau.

05:47.845 --> 05:49.239
Anything is possible.

05:49.273 --> 05:50.774
But if he did set them up,

05:50.808 --> 05:53.276
that means that you
recruited a double agent.

05:53.310 --> 05:55.278
Yes. I'm aware. Thank you.

05:55.312 --> 05:58.548
Which means now somebody
has to go find him.

06:10.002 --> 06:12.264
What are you doing? We're
in the middle of a game here.

06:12.384 --> 06:13.522
Where you going?

06:13.642 --> 06:15.231
Ball game's over, boys.

06:22.435 --> 06:24.334
You got this, bro. Feel better.

06:27.274 --> 06:29.558
Make sure that hole in
your side heals quick.

06:29.678 --> 06:31.823
Keep your heads down.
I'll be with you in spirit.

06:31.943 --> 06:33.548
Hey, you ain't sat out a game since you

06:33.582 --> 06:35.016
had your tonsils out when you was six.

06:35.050 --> 06:37.199
Appendix. And I was nine.

06:37.319 --> 06:38.620
All right.

06:38.654 --> 06:40.021
So what's it now?

06:40.055 --> 06:42.035
Nothing. I'ma be fine.

06:42.858 --> 06:43.875
Come on.

06:43.995 --> 06:45.835
I want to show you something.

06:50.866 --> 06:52.276
Hello, Edna.

06:53.469 --> 06:55.303
Pastor George.

06:55.338 --> 06:56.838
Flowers look beautiful.

06:59.342 --> 07:00.809
Keyshawn Willis.

07:00.843 --> 07:02.043
13 years old.

07:02.078 --> 07:03.812
Killed in a drive-by Thursday.

07:06.816 --> 07:10.719
52nd Street crew got
themselves a new shot caller.

07:10.753 --> 07:13.788
They using kids as corner boys again.

07:13.823 --> 07:14.856
You know who?

07:14.890 --> 07:16.264
Oh, yeah.

07:16.892 --> 07:19.060
- You talk to the cops?
- What?

07:19.095 --> 07:21.310
- The police. You talk to the police?
- Please. I got more use

07:21.430 --> 07:23.865
for a back pocket on my shirt.

07:23.899 --> 07:26.201
'Cause what you're asking me
to do, I don't do that anymore.

07:26.235 --> 07:28.336
John, this is me asking.

07:28.371 --> 07:29.838
And I know you know
better than to ask me...

07:29.872 --> 07:32.807
Your big brother. Your
own flesh and blood.

07:32.842 --> 07:34.175
You done?

07:36.224 --> 07:37.894
13 years old.

07:39.382 --> 07:40.797
I understand.

07:41.384 --> 07:43.485
Believe me. I understand.

07:43.519 --> 07:44.913
But you gotta work within

07:45.033 --> 07:46.421
the system on this.

07:46.541 --> 07:50.358
Is that what I was supposed to
say this afternoon at the funeral?

07:50.393 --> 07:52.627
Isn't it your job to
pray at the funeral?

07:54.435 --> 07:56.105
_

08:03.272 --> 08:04.372
Hey.

08:04.407 --> 08:07.629
- You speak English?
- Please, let me go.

08:09.359 --> 08:10.912
You're coming with us.

08:10.946 --> 08:12.380
Okay, okay.

08:12.415 --> 08:14.363
Gun.

08:21.290 --> 08:23.291
We gotta keep him alive.

08:24.894 --> 08:27.262
Yuri. Real name or code name?

08:27.296 --> 08:29.197
Real name.

08:29.231 --> 08:31.266
Who are you? CIA?

08:31.300 --> 08:32.895
- You wish.
- Please.

08:33.015 --> 08:35.804
What happened in Keykino,
I had nothing to do with that.

08:35.837 --> 08:37.272
Why didn't you show up?

08:37.306 --> 08:38.940
It's complicated.

08:38.974 --> 08:40.375
So boil it down.

08:40.409 --> 08:42.577
Complicated and personal.

08:42.611 --> 08:43.912
We got a tail.

08:50.186 --> 08:51.386
_

08:51.506 --> 08:53.588
- FSB.
- They with you?

08:53.622 --> 08:55.490
No. Please. They must not see me.

08:59.929 --> 09:00.962
I knew it.

09:00.996 --> 09:02.564
They found out about me.

09:02.598 --> 09:04.232
Now they kill me too.

09:05.072 --> 09:06.601
Found out about what?

09:06.635 --> 09:09.270
That I was trying to defect to CIA.

09:09.305 --> 09:11.306
Two CIA officers were killed.

09:11.340 --> 09:13.756
- Langley says you set them up.
- No, I didn't do that.

09:13.876 --> 09:15.343
I swear on...

09:15.377 --> 09:17.579
If they knew about the two CIA officers

09:17.613 --> 09:19.614
and the meeting place,

09:19.648 --> 09:21.831
- why didn't they know about you?
- I don't know.

09:21.951 --> 09:24.352
But now they do. Look!

09:28.509 --> 09:31.192
He was about to swear on someone's life.

09:31.227 --> 09:33.876
- Ask him who.
- Sierra, this is Zero. Question.

09:33.996 --> 09:35.549
Can it wait a sec?

09:36.166 --> 09:37.265
Roger.

09:39.568 --> 09:41.469
12 minutes to Foxtrot Oscar.

09:41.504 --> 09:43.204
Roger. 12 minutes. Standing by.

09:43.239 --> 09:45.421
Foxtrot Oscar. What is... what is fox...

09:45.541 --> 09:48.943
- Airplane out of here.
- What... I can't leave Russia.

09:48.978 --> 09:51.161
I thought you wanted to defect.

09:53.716 --> 09:55.297
I got this.

10:01.323 --> 10:03.458
Hey! Get your ass back here!

10:05.367 --> 10:08.496
Shooting Russian agents on
Russian soil is an act of war.

10:08.531 --> 10:12.022
- I'm telling you, he's playing us.
- I'm not playing you. I swear.

10:20.342 --> 10:21.976
Zero, this is Romeo.

10:22.011 --> 10:24.045
Moving to the shrug now.

10:24.079 --> 10:26.648
I do want to get out of
Russia, yes, but I can't.

10:26.682 --> 10:28.065
Why not?

10:28.350 --> 10:30.418
Not without my girlfriend.

10:30.452 --> 10:32.654
Your girlfriend?

10:32.688 --> 10:35.924
There was no mention of
a girlfriend to the CIA.

10:35.958 --> 10:39.527
Well, no, because she is the
wife of my superior officer,

10:39.562 --> 10:41.496
Colonel Sergei Kuznikov.

10:41.530 --> 10:44.499
What, you thought you'd just
spring her on the CIA?

10:44.533 --> 10:47.669
She got scared last second
and wouldn't come to Keykino.

10:49.104 --> 10:50.505
Anyone buying this crap?

10:50.539 --> 10:52.073
She couldn't come.

10:52.107 --> 10:53.708
Please. It's true.

10:53.742 --> 10:55.410
On Tatjana's...

10:55.444 --> 10:57.946
That's her name: Tatjana.

10:57.980 --> 10:59.747
I swear on her life.

11:00.591 --> 11:02.417
86 the extraction.

11:02.451 --> 11:04.583
Stand by for further instructions.

11:05.988 --> 11:07.422
- What?
- You heard.

11:07.456 --> 11:08.856
We ain't done here yet.

11:16.261 --> 11:19.094
Yuri's having an affair
with Tatjana Kuznikov?

11:19.214 --> 11:20.615
You had no idea.

11:20.649 --> 11:23.132
- No. None.
- Well, maybe she's the problem.

11:23.252 --> 11:25.219
Kuznikov used her to get to Yuri.

11:25.254 --> 11:27.054
Some vodka, a little pillow talk?

11:27.089 --> 11:29.524
Suppose for a minute that neither Yuri

11:29.558 --> 11:32.026
nor Tatjana Kuznikov are responsible

11:32.060 --> 11:33.928
for the Keykino ambush.

11:37.299 --> 11:39.567
Who else knew Yuri's identity?

11:39.601 --> 11:42.236
Me and Pulowski and
McFaddyen, that's it.

11:42.271 --> 11:45.573
So no one else at Moscow
Station or Langley

11:45.607 --> 11:49.110
knew anything at all about
Yuri or the meeting at Keykino?

11:49.144 --> 11:50.527
Not even Sy.

11:51.079 --> 11:52.366
Okay.

11:52.486 --> 11:55.216
Gretchen, I'm gonna need
your help around the clock

11:55.250 --> 11:57.151
as I move my people
through Saint Petersburg.

11:57.185 --> 11:58.653
Of course. Anything you need.

11:58.687 --> 12:01.589
Move your people around
doing exactly what?

12:01.623 --> 12:03.658
What do you know about Kuznikov?

12:03.692 --> 12:05.560
A nasty piece of work.

12:05.594 --> 12:07.128
Backroom bully who
rose through the ranks

12:07.162 --> 12:09.387
- putting the wood to the Chechens.
- Anything else?

12:09.507 --> 12:11.232
Our hands are pretty full right now

12:11.266 --> 12:14.268
with Russian activity in
Syria, Iran, and Ukraine.

12:15.604 --> 12:17.138
Khalid Murvan.

12:17.172 --> 12:19.073
A Chechen activist rumored
to have been kidnapped,

12:19.107 --> 12:22.009
tortured, and killed by
Kuznikov last month.

12:22.044 --> 12:23.611
Where did you get that?

12:23.645 --> 12:26.106
A friend in German intelligence.

12:35.057 --> 12:36.157
Are you crazy?

12:36.191 --> 12:38.159
You kill FSB officers

12:38.193 --> 12:40.027
in the middle of Saint Petersburg!

12:40.062 --> 12:41.963
You think you can get away with that?

12:41.997 --> 12:43.685
For your hands.

12:51.423 --> 12:53.708
Boss says to get the Colonel's wife.

12:53.742 --> 12:55.676
You speak Chechen?

12:55.711 --> 12:57.278
Wait. No.

12:57.312 --> 13:00.181
Tatjana, you don't
understand. She won't.

13:00.215 --> 13:02.694
Do you speak Chechen: Yes or no?

13:02.814 --> 13:04.145
Yes.

13:04.753 --> 13:06.153
- Some.
- Good.

13:06.188 --> 13:08.289
You're gonna teach him a few words.

13:08.633 --> 13:10.188
- Me?
- You.

13:11.226 --> 13:13.628
We're going to need a safe
house to debrief Tatjana.

13:13.662 --> 13:16.631
Preferably one that you
and only you know about.

13:16.665 --> 13:18.299
We all have one of those.

13:18.333 --> 13:19.938
For a rainy day.

13:49.952 --> 13:51.512
_

14:04.594 --> 14:06.962
_

14:08.283 --> 14:10.017
Gonna deactivate the alarm system

14:10.052 --> 14:11.686
with what'll look like a
routine software update.

14:11.720 --> 14:14.786
No red flags. Buys you ten minutes.

14:16.036 --> 14:17.124
Hit it.

14:17.159 --> 14:20.094
Three, two, one.

14:21.830 --> 14:23.431
Roger. We're a go.

14:27.302 --> 14:28.402
Wait.

14:31.027 --> 14:32.139
Take this.

14:32.174 --> 14:33.531
She gave it to me.

14:33.943 --> 14:35.810
Does Tatjana speak any English?

14:35.844 --> 14:37.411
Yes, yes, she speaks it well.

14:37.446 --> 14:39.725
- Can I tell you something?
- We gotta move.

14:40.269 --> 14:41.816
- What is it?
- Becca.

14:41.850 --> 14:43.378
Please...

14:44.186 --> 14:45.553
Don't hurt her.

15:10.986 --> 15:12.747
You all know Brant Pope,

15:12.781 --> 15:14.448
Divisional Director of Eastern Europe.

15:14.483 --> 15:16.450
Just in time. Have a seat.

15:19.488 --> 15:21.322
Bravo and Victor are in position.

15:21.356 --> 15:22.823
Here we go.

15:46.248 --> 15:47.782
Yuri's outside.

15:47.816 --> 15:49.273
Okay?

15:51.386 --> 15:53.220
Are you the CIA?

15:53.255 --> 15:54.455
Cousins.

15:57.310 --> 15:58.459
Plate check.

15:58.493 --> 15:59.867
Send.

16:01.830 --> 16:05.499
Kilo, eight, four, one, hotel.

16:08.057 --> 16:10.237
I can't go with you.

16:10.272 --> 16:12.154
- Sure you can.
- Come on. Come on.

16:12.274 --> 16:13.874
It's Colonel Kuznikov.

16:13.909 --> 16:16.377
I thought you said you had
eyes on the SVR building.

16:16.411 --> 16:18.512
Maybe he came from somewhere else.

16:25.954 --> 16:28.119
Bravo, Roger. We gotta move now.

16:46.441 --> 16:49.291
_

16:55.617 --> 16:57.896
- We can't kill Kuznikov.
- He knows.

16:58.016 --> 17:00.498
- That's heat we don't need.
- He knows.

17:55.377 --> 17:57.444
We have one more problem.

18:04.649 --> 18:06.287
She's pregnant.

18:06.321 --> 18:08.322
Oh, come on. You gotta laugh.

18:25.632 --> 18:27.552
Scott, Tatjana.

18:27.935 --> 18:30.002
Tatjana, Scott.

18:33.507 --> 18:35.041
How many months?

18:35.075 --> 18:36.609
Too many.

18:47.521 --> 18:48.955
How is she?

18:51.959 --> 18:53.317
She's fine.

19:01.535 --> 19:03.152
Sorry to keep you.

19:03.272 --> 19:04.637
Hello, Brant.

19:04.671 --> 19:06.011
Christina.

19:06.543 --> 19:07.740
I'm impressed.

19:07.775 --> 19:09.342
I presume you're here

19:09.376 --> 19:11.225
to watch your back in your time of need.

19:11.345 --> 19:13.312
He's here because I asked him to be here

19:13.347 --> 19:15.738
- as her Divisional Director.
- Anything I should know?

19:17.017 --> 19:18.908
You guys figure that out yet?

19:20.335 --> 19:22.455
You gotta turn the power on first.

19:39.880 --> 19:41.259
You all right?

19:52.889 --> 19:54.498
Where's this Mook at?

19:56.639 --> 19:58.585
_

20:05.032 --> 20:06.484
False alarm?

20:07.034 --> 20:08.434
Maybe.

20:10.037 --> 20:12.542
Please. Let me go to her.

20:12.662 --> 20:15.141
Why didn't you tell us she was pregnant?

20:15.175 --> 20:17.851
I didn't think that you
would go and rescue her.

20:17.971 --> 20:19.712
Lives being on the line and all.

20:21.315 --> 20:23.283
Did you tell her about Keykino?

20:23.317 --> 20:25.385
Yes, of course I did.

20:25.419 --> 20:30.323
What, do you think that she
is the one who told Kuznikov?

20:30.357 --> 20:31.824
Do you mean her husband?

20:31.859 --> 20:34.294
She would never do that. She hates him.

20:34.328 --> 20:36.629
He... he beats her for no reason.

20:36.664 --> 20:40.300
Can you imagine what a man
like that would do to her

20:40.334 --> 20:43.536
if he found out that the baby isn't his?

20:43.570 --> 20:45.538
So why did she change
her mind the other day?

20:45.572 --> 20:48.207
The doctor put her on bed rest.

20:48.242 --> 20:50.910
'Cause her pregnancy is at risk.

20:50.944 --> 20:53.850
Please, can I see her now?

21:11.265 --> 21:12.865
What are you thinking?

21:12.900 --> 21:14.934
I'm thinking...

21:14.968 --> 21:18.535
The SVR Colonel showing up
unannounced back there...

21:20.607 --> 21:22.442
Has got me thinking.

21:39.960 --> 21:41.751
Yes?

21:44.665 --> 21:46.366
Yuri!

21:59.513 --> 22:03.616
Yuri says America is a beautiful place

22:03.650 --> 22:06.104
for a little girl to grow up.

22:26.707 --> 22:28.574
You can handle that tonight, man.

22:28.609 --> 22:30.276
Hey, lookit here, though.

22:30.310 --> 22:31.544
Who this?

22:37.451 --> 22:39.085
You need to leave the kids alone.

22:39.119 --> 22:40.353
Who are you?

22:40.387 --> 22:41.954
My name's John.

22:41.989 --> 22:43.589
Bye, John.

23:01.708 --> 23:03.476
Leave the kids alone.

23:03.510 --> 23:05.532
Last time I tell you that.

23:16.590 --> 23:17.925
I got two.

23:18.592 --> 23:19.631
You?

23:20.360 --> 23:22.136
One.

23:22.256 --> 23:24.530
- Two.
- What?

23:26.770 --> 23:29.535
Zero, it's Sierra. We got incoming.

23:31.505 --> 23:33.689
- Again.
- Ping John. Get him in here.

23:33.809 --> 23:36.042
All call signs, we got
another situation.

23:36.076 --> 23:38.144
Radio silence till further notice.

23:38.178 --> 23:40.513
It's time to get Yuri
and Tatjana out of here.

23:46.594 --> 23:48.154
- Get up.
- Careful.

23:48.188 --> 23:50.416
She's meant to be on bed rest.

23:54.493 --> 23:56.090
_

23:59.633 --> 24:01.701
Get Oscar Vertanan on a secure line.

24:01.735 --> 24:03.736
- Who's Oscar Vertanan?
- An Asset.

24:03.770 --> 24:06.506
Oil man from Finland who flies
in and out of Saint Petersburg

24:06.540 --> 24:09.108
every week on his company
helicopter, no questions asked.

24:09.142 --> 24:10.543
How solid?

24:10.577 --> 24:12.712
I got his daughter into Harvard.

24:12.746 --> 24:13.823
Do it.

24:13.943 --> 24:15.581
Which is the secure line?

24:15.616 --> 24:16.958
All of them.

24:17.584 --> 24:19.852
You, you, my office.

25:07.701 --> 25:09.235
Come on.

25:31.291 --> 25:32.658
This way.

25:33.115 --> 25:34.179
Come on.

25:45.305 --> 25:46.615
Okay!

26:03.857 --> 26:05.291
Is it safe?

26:05.325 --> 26:06.626
Come on.

26:06.660 --> 26:08.230
We're going to Finland.

26:16.164 --> 26:17.865
Contractions are getting closer!

26:17.899 --> 26:19.333
You have to do something!

26:19.368 --> 26:20.768
You want to get out and start

26:20.802 --> 26:23.270
directing traffic yourself, be my guest.

26:27.461 --> 26:29.391
Oof. Been there, done that.

26:29.511 --> 26:31.345
Feel your pain, bro.

26:31.380 --> 26:32.480
His pain?

26:35.183 --> 26:36.617
You got kids?

26:42.090 --> 26:44.373
- Get us out of here, Rem. Let's go.
- Screw this.

26:44.493 --> 26:45.732
Hold on!

27:04.946 --> 27:06.647
What is it, Riley?

27:11.953 --> 27:13.803
This Oscar Vertanan.

27:14.556 --> 27:17.925
I just wonder if, with
everything that's happened,

27:17.959 --> 27:20.528
we should be trusting
other people's Assets.

27:22.564 --> 27:24.899
Or trusting other people, period.

27:27.369 --> 27:28.653
Right.

27:29.282 --> 27:30.806
We're in.

27:31.573 --> 27:33.207
Is that John?

28:33.368 --> 28:35.002
Well, what do you know?

28:35.036 --> 28:37.853
Bunch of secret crap that never
should have gotten out of Langley

28:37.973 --> 28:40.885
- buried deep in the hard drive.
- I think that's it.

28:45.947 --> 28:47.615
Okay, we're good.

28:47.649 --> 28:49.950
It's a private airfield.
Main gate to the west.

28:49.985 --> 28:51.919
Vertanan's taking care
of the security people.

28:51.953 --> 28:53.068
How?

28:53.188 --> 28:54.622
Money talks, young lady.

28:54.656 --> 28:56.624
Money talks, especially in Russia.

28:56.658 --> 28:59.426
Talk later. Stay by your phone.

28:59.461 --> 29:01.510
- Where have you been?
- Bathroom.

29:01.630 --> 29:02.630
Who was that?

29:02.664 --> 29:04.906
Our embassy in Helsinki.
They're scrambling an

29:05.026 --> 29:08.850
- ambulance and a doctor.
- Thought we agreed to limit exposure.

29:08.970 --> 29:10.814
They think it's for one
of my staff. It's fine.

29:18.079 --> 29:19.480
What's going on?

29:23.304 --> 29:25.386
She's also up to her neck in debt.

29:25.420 --> 29:27.402
- Sick mother.
- Where was all this?

29:27.522 --> 29:28.622
Her computer.

29:28.657 --> 29:30.324
I mean, where was the computer?

29:30.358 --> 29:32.059
Rolltop desk.

29:32.093 --> 29:33.627
What's in her safe?

29:33.662 --> 29:35.563
Didn't want to mess with
it. Not enough time.

29:35.597 --> 29:38.666
Figured this was enough
to be going in with.

29:44.673 --> 29:47.341
They're three minutes from the airfield.

29:47.375 --> 29:49.076
Vertanan's waiting on the helicopter.

29:49.110 --> 29:51.055
Engine's running, security's on site.

29:51.175 --> 29:53.607
There's that money talking.

29:54.382 --> 29:56.050
Sierra, this is Zero.

29:56.084 --> 29:57.685
Sierra, send.

29:57.719 --> 29:59.486
We do this by the book.

29:59.521 --> 30:01.522
We don't need another Srebrenica.

30:03.347 --> 30:05.029
Sierra, Roger.

30:05.149 --> 30:06.202
Out.

30:06.322 --> 30:09.468
- What happened in Srebrenica?
- Nothing good.

30:11.399 --> 30:14.068
You got your SVR card on you, Yuri?

30:23.612 --> 30:25.412
Stop, stop.

30:32.087 --> 30:34.210
_

30:35.879 --> 30:38.105
_

30:41.480 --> 30:43.186
_

30:43.822 --> 30:45.213
Zero, this is Victor.

30:45.333 --> 30:47.568
On final approach to airfield now.

31:01.558 --> 31:02.750
Contact.

31:02.784 --> 31:04.652
Ambush. Son of a bitch.

31:04.686 --> 31:06.620
The Russian military was
waiting for us on the bird.

31:22.771 --> 31:25.906
You want to really know
what happened in Srebrenica?

31:27.442 --> 31:29.610
We hunted down a mole.

31:41.273 --> 31:42.840
Where did you find them?

31:42.875 --> 31:44.189
Your home computer.

31:44.887 --> 31:46.911
You broke into my house.

31:46.945 --> 31:48.913
First there's the two CIA officers

31:48.947 --> 31:51.249
sold out to the Russians.

31:51.283 --> 31:53.784
Then there's a near miss
at Colonel Kuznikov's.

31:53.819 --> 31:55.219
Then there's the fiasco

31:55.254 --> 31:57.588
at the safe house that you gave us.

31:58.423 --> 32:00.191
You broke into my house

32:00.225 --> 32:02.260
and my home computer.

32:02.294 --> 32:05.630
- And you planted these files.
- You know we didn't do that.

32:05.750 --> 32:07.265
Put me on a polygraph.

32:07.299 --> 32:08.799
Polygraph?

32:08.834 --> 32:10.907
Like you never trained for that?

32:11.027 --> 32:12.470
Then I want a lawyer.

32:12.504 --> 32:14.500
If that's how you want to play it.

32:15.974 --> 32:17.808
And I mean in the next hour.

32:17.843 --> 32:20.392
- Not three days from now.
- Oh, trust me.

32:20.512 --> 32:22.246
We're in a hurry too.

32:31.323 --> 32:32.625
So what now?

32:32.991 --> 32:34.825
Maybe you should take a run at her, sir.

32:34.860 --> 32:36.560
Sure, I can do that.

32:36.595 --> 32:38.396
What happened to having her back?

32:38.430 --> 32:40.564
You're the one with folks
in a bind in Russia.

32:40.599 --> 32:43.167
Where I was raised, those
in the field come first.

32:43.201 --> 32:44.435
You're right.

32:44.469 --> 32:45.838
Let's do this.

32:58.884 --> 33:00.584
The good news is...

33:03.355 --> 33:05.393
Your wife's having the baby.

33:06.358 --> 33:07.848
Better news is,

33:08.493 --> 33:10.294
it's not yours.

33:11.663 --> 33:12.863
Drive.

33:14.552 --> 33:16.315
_

33:23.909 --> 33:25.276
Gretchen.

33:25.310 --> 33:26.610
Brant, this...

33:26.645 --> 33:28.012
I didn't do this.

33:28.046 --> 33:29.313
We know.

33:31.049 --> 33:32.483
What?

33:32.517 --> 33:34.652
Give us the room, please, Gretchen.

33:43.996 --> 33:45.528
Sit down, Brant.

33:46.302 --> 33:48.213
- Excuse me?
- Sir.

33:49.770 --> 33:52.431
- I am the Divisional Director...
- Sit.

34:03.415 --> 34:06.317
If Gretchen sold out her own officers,

34:06.351 --> 34:08.585
then why not give up Yuri too?

34:08.620 --> 34:10.521
See, that doesn't make any sense,

34:10.554 --> 34:13.524
which means whoever gave up those guys

34:13.558 --> 34:15.993
didn't yet know Yuri's identity.

34:16.027 --> 34:19.397
You just found reams of secret
CIA communiqués in her home.

34:19.431 --> 34:22.933
But they did have access
to movement orders, plans,

34:22.967 --> 34:25.972
and reports of the
officers in Moscow Station.

34:26.092 --> 34:27.231
Seriously?

34:27.351 --> 34:30.174
Someone, say, like
their Divisional Director.

34:30.208 --> 34:32.380
- Little desperate, are we?
- If Gretchen was taking

34:32.500 --> 34:34.259
Russian money to pay
her mother's medical bills,

34:34.379 --> 34:36.480
then why is she still in debt?

34:36.514 --> 34:39.483
And why leave documents like
that on her computer in her desk

34:39.518 --> 34:41.485
when she has a state-of-the-art safe?

34:41.520 --> 34:43.498
- You need to ask her.
- Like you said, I've got

34:43.619 --> 34:45.326
my people in the field,
and time is running out.

34:45.446 --> 34:48.047
I wasn't even involved
in this operation.

34:48.168 --> 34:49.596
- Until...
- Until Kuznikov showed

34:49.716 --> 34:52.563
up at his home at
exactly the right time.

34:52.684 --> 34:54.172
Gretchen waited

34:54.293 --> 34:56.434
until she wasn't the only
suspect. She's smart.

34:56.467 --> 34:59.302
So why isn't she pointing
the finger at you?

35:09.414 --> 35:12.917
Treason is front page stuff, Brant.

35:12.951 --> 35:15.253
It doesn't just end your career.

35:15.287 --> 35:19.112
It ruins your family for generations.

35:19.892 --> 35:22.860
And then there's your son, Robert.

35:22.895 --> 35:26.606
How does Robert live
with that level of shame?

35:27.646 --> 35:29.594
Sit down.

35:39.311 --> 35:42.850
He's a bright boy, Robert.
He's got a bright future.

35:42.970 --> 35:45.816
Unless, of course, this kind
of behavior runs in the family.

35:45.851 --> 35:48.703
But let's give him the
benefit of a doubt for now.

35:48.823 --> 35:52.223
So either I leak your arrest

35:52.257 --> 35:54.225
and you watch the bottom

35:54.259 --> 35:58.119
slowly drop out of Robert's world, or...

36:07.873 --> 36:09.237
What is that?

36:10.229 --> 36:11.943
Natural causes.

36:15.480 --> 36:17.949
You have two minutes to decide.

36:17.983 --> 36:20.318
You can't do this.

36:20.352 --> 36:22.300
For our folks in the field?

36:24.022 --> 36:25.323
You kidding?

37:13.071 --> 37:16.187
Reestablish comms with
the team. We have our mole.

37:36.294 --> 37:37.928
Why, Brant?

37:37.963 --> 37:39.063
Money.

37:39.579 --> 37:41.032
Money talks.

37:42.446 --> 37:44.602
Robert's stronger than me.

37:44.636 --> 37:47.586
He takes after his
mom. He'll be okay.

37:47.974 --> 37:49.304
Let's hope so.

37:56.636 --> 37:57.942
Harmless.

38:02.721 --> 38:04.114
Saline.

38:06.491 --> 38:08.359
No, no, no.

38:08.393 --> 38:10.728
No. We had a deal.

38:10.762 --> 38:11.962
Please!

38:11.997 --> 38:13.464
Please!

38:13.498 --> 38:15.981
_

38:21.473 --> 38:22.573
Take her hand.

38:38.156 --> 38:39.423
_

38:46.119 --> 38:47.825
_

38:47.945 --> 38:51.272
_

38:56.527 --> 38:58.584
_

39:01.015 --> 39:04.559
_

39:05.188 --> 39:06.495
_

39:06.615 --> 39:09.001
_

39:40.685 --> 39:42.330
Why me?

39:44.689 --> 39:47.476
I prayed for a solution,

39:48.093 --> 39:49.363
and he...

39:50.355 --> 39:51.528
Gave me you.

39:54.232 --> 39:55.666
I honestly believed

39:55.700 --> 39:58.169
you left that life behind
a long time ago.

40:00.572 --> 40:02.473
I honestly did.

40:05.243 --> 40:09.547
Problem is, you never believed
that I too left it behind.

40:09.581 --> 40:11.682
That is not true.

40:11.716 --> 40:14.685
I'm not the answer to
your prayers, George.

40:14.719 --> 40:15.995
You know why?

40:17.122 --> 40:19.415
I don't think you praying right.

40:22.127 --> 40:26.096
I think you praying like some
kind of punk-ass hypocrite.

40:26.131 --> 40:29.700
Maybe you should stop
praying for solutions

40:29.734 --> 40:32.203
and just try harder to be one.

40:44.883 --> 40:46.415
You ready to roll?

40:48.820 --> 40:51.255
You really got kids, huh?

40:51.289 --> 40:52.487
Yep.

40:54.626 --> 40:56.694
They're the reason I do this work.

40:58.597 --> 41:00.598
You're crazy.

41:00.632 --> 41:02.600
That's the other reason.
