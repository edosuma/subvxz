WEBVTT

00:04.569 --> 00:06.484
- Previously on
"The Arrangement"...

00:06.528 --> 00:09.705
- This is your lead actor.
This is your star.

00:09.748 --> 00:11.489
I thought it was more important
to focus on directing,

00:11.533 --> 00:13.143
and let Megan carry the film.

00:13.187 --> 00:14.449
- And you... you honestly
think she can do that?

00:14.492 --> 00:16.059
- Oh, Megan's gonna
blow everybody away.

00:16.103 --> 00:17.669
- I said don't look at me!

00:17.713 --> 00:20.542
- If you stay, we're talking
about a full-blown affair.

00:20.585 --> 00:22.152
- Yeah.

00:22.196 --> 00:25.329
- Please welcome
the incredible Xavier Hughes!

00:25.373 --> 00:27.418
- That's my boyfriend.

00:27.462 --> 00:29.072
- Have you ever acted before?

00:30.682 --> 00:32.293
- I need you,

00:32.336 --> 00:34.817
'cause I'm gonna burn
the whole thing down.

00:34.860 --> 00:36.340
- It's not just stress.
- Are you okay?

00:36.384 --> 00:37.559
- My stomach.

00:37.602 --> 00:39.169
- Something else is going on,

00:39.213 --> 00:40.431
and I think you and I
should work together

00:40.475 --> 00:42.172
until we figure out what it is.

00:58.536 --> 01:00.712
- So describe how that felt.

01:00.756 --> 01:03.106
- It was strange.

01:03.150 --> 01:05.194
It was, uh, strange.

01:05.239 --> 01:07.719
It was also kinda cool.

01:07.763 --> 01:09.417
Exhilarating.

01:09.460 --> 01:11.201
- You didn't feel
self-conscious?

01:11.245 --> 01:12.507
- No.

01:12.550 --> 01:14.726
Not really.

01:14.770 --> 01:16.641
It was a relief.

01:16.685 --> 01:18.208
- A relief?

01:18.252 --> 01:20.210
Explore that.

01:20.254 --> 01:23.126
- Not caring what
other people think.

01:24.693 --> 01:27.870
Working in this industry, it...

01:27.913 --> 01:29.567
puts these standards,

01:29.611 --> 01:33.136
this enormous pressure

01:33.180 --> 01:35.530
on people, on... on women to...

01:35.573 --> 01:38.098
- Megan,
don't externalize blame.

01:38.141 --> 01:40.535
It's an escape from
self-reflection.

01:40.578 --> 01:42.232
Talk about you.

01:42.276 --> 01:43.755
What do you feel?

01:48.238 --> 01:50.240
- Sometimes, I...

01:53.243 --> 01:54.505
Sometimes, I find it difficult

01:54.549 --> 01:56.768
to get out of bed
in the morning.

01:58.857 --> 02:01.904
I just lie there,

02:01.947 --> 02:04.602
waiting to be judged,

02:04.646 --> 02:07.431
picked apart by a world
that doesn't know me,

02:07.475 --> 02:10.434
and... and that's overwhelming.

02:10.478 --> 02:12.436
- Any stomach pains lately?

02:12.480 --> 02:14.743
- No. No, not since...

02:14.786 --> 02:17.441
- You were diagnosed
with extreme stress.

02:17.485 --> 02:19.574
Do you feel
you've conquered that?

02:19.617 --> 02:22.229
- No.

02:22.272 --> 02:24.187
But today helped.

02:29.366 --> 02:31.412
- Okay, let's stop here.

02:31.455 --> 02:32.891
- 'Kay.

02:32.935 --> 02:35.285
There's a table read coming up.
I have to focus.

02:35.329 --> 02:37.505
Our next session's
in a couple of days.

02:37.548 --> 02:39.246
I'll talk to Zach
about the schedule...

02:39.289 --> 02:40.682
- Don't.

02:40.725 --> 02:42.205
I'll talk to Zach.

02:42.249 --> 02:43.859
I'd like to accelerate things.

02:43.902 --> 02:46.253
- Accelerate?
- Yeah, our work together.

02:46.296 --> 02:48.211
You have to stop
bullshitting me.

02:48.255 --> 02:49.343
- T-Terence, I'm... I'm not...

02:49.386 --> 02:51.432
- Yes, you are.
You're deflecting.

02:51.475 --> 02:54.348
There's something else
at the core of your stress,

02:54.391 --> 02:55.827
somewhere you don't wanna go.

02:55.871 --> 02:58.395
But if you want my help
and you wanna get better,

02:58.439 --> 03:00.963
then we have to go there.

03:01.006 --> 03:03.487
And we will.

03:03.531 --> 03:05.315
Time to dig deep.

03:19.286 --> 03:21.505
- Wow. Thank you to everyone
who came out today

03:21.549 --> 03:23.855
for the start of
an amazing adventure called

03:23.899 --> 03:25.509
"Technicolor Highway."

03:25.553 --> 03:26.641
- Whoo!

03:30.732 --> 03:32.299
- I cannot wait to start
shooting this thing

03:32.342 --> 03:33.952
in three days.

03:33.996 --> 03:36.303
It's all I can think about;
it's all I can talk about.

03:36.346 --> 03:37.652
This one knows:

03:37.695 --> 03:39.523
our leading lady
and my soon-to-be wife.

03:39.567 --> 03:40.698
Thank you so much
for putting up with me.

03:40.742 --> 03:42.004
- You're very welcome.

03:44.746 --> 03:47.879
- And a big thank you to DeAnn,
our fearless producer,

03:47.923 --> 03:49.577
who has kept this train
on its tracks.

03:49.620 --> 03:51.883
Not an easy gig, I know.

03:55.017 --> 03:58.412
- So let's dig into
this thing, shall we?

03:58.455 --> 04:02.024
Night,
deserted country road.

04:02.067 --> 04:03.808
- That's not fair. You can't...

04:03.852 --> 04:05.680
- Can't what? Leave?

04:05.723 --> 04:08.900
I don't owe you a damn thing.

04:08.944 --> 04:10.815
- You're in this with me now.

04:10.859 --> 04:13.035
We're in this, and I need you...
- Need?

04:13.078 --> 04:14.602
You don't need anyone.

04:14.645 --> 04:16.386
I don't even know you.

04:16.430 --> 04:17.909
Everything you've told me
is a lie,

04:17.952 --> 04:22.262
so don't try and pretend
you give a shit about me!

04:22.305 --> 04:23.698
Like you need me.

04:23.741 --> 04:25.526
- What do you want me to say?

04:27.702 --> 04:30.270
- Something... real?

04:31.619 --> 04:33.490
Anything.

04:35.884 --> 04:38.582
- I don't know
what real is anymore.

04:47.591 --> 04:49.376
- It was just a table read.

04:49.419 --> 04:51.073
She's gonna be incredible
on the day.

04:51.116 --> 04:52.814
- Yes, she will,

04:52.857 --> 04:56.296
because her director will
get her there if she isn't.

04:56.339 --> 04:57.775
Now, what about
our other problem?

04:57.819 --> 04:59.603
- Xavier?

04:59.647 --> 05:01.910
Three days. I'll work with him.

05:01.953 --> 05:03.781
I'll get him down to earth.
- 'Kay.

05:06.567 --> 05:08.090
- How 'bout we set something up
later today?

05:08.133 --> 05:09.309
- Oh, great.

05:10.310 --> 05:11.963
- Look, we've been over this
a dozen times.

05:12.007 --> 05:13.922
I'm getting sick and tired...

05:16.011 --> 05:17.752
I don't care.

05:17.795 --> 05:18.970
If I have to get someone else
on this case, I will.

05:19.014 --> 05:20.581
Do you understand me?

05:23.148 --> 05:25.673
Well, put more officers on it,
canvass the city.

05:25.716 --> 05:28.328
Do something.

05:28.371 --> 05:29.633
Listen to me, Dave,

05:29.677 --> 05:30.982
this guy put
a goddamn gun to my head,

05:31.026 --> 05:32.549
and when he goes on a rampage,

05:32.593 --> 05:34.769
I'll make sure the press
knows exactly why.

05:36.510 --> 05:37.815
- Hey.
- Shaun, hi.

05:37.859 --> 05:40.122
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah, fine.

05:46.389 --> 05:48.739
- Terence?

05:48.783 --> 05:50.785
Hey, how was Megan today?

05:50.828 --> 05:52.395
- I thought she was fine.

05:52.439 --> 05:53.918
She was focused. Uh...

05:53.962 --> 05:55.833
you know, a little cold,
but you'll get her there.

05:55.877 --> 05:57.574
- No, no, I mean
your work with her.

05:57.618 --> 05:59.837
- Oh, come on, Kyle,
you know that's private.

05:59.881 --> 06:02.449
- Fine.
Just don't rattle her.

06:02.492 --> 06:04.407
You know, we're three days out.
I need my lead actor on point.

06:04.451 --> 06:06.627
- You want her
to get better, right?

06:06.670 --> 06:08.672
- Yeah.
- All right.

06:08.716 --> 06:11.632
Focus on prep.
I'll worry about Megan, okay?

06:16.071 --> 06:18.160
- No, sorry.

06:18.203 --> 06:20.684
- What if you asked him to
take you back to the Facility?

06:20.728 --> 06:22.033
Maybe next time...

06:22.077 --> 06:23.600
- I'll never get to see
what you saw, Megan.

06:23.644 --> 06:24.949
They won't let me.

06:24.993 --> 06:26.647
And, besides,

06:26.690 --> 06:28.866
I think I need to tap
the brakes a little with James.

06:28.910 --> 06:30.694
I don't want Terence
to get suspicious.

06:30.738 --> 06:33.175
- Yeah.
Welcome to my life.

06:33.218 --> 06:35.656
And I can't keep faking my way
through these sessions.

06:35.699 --> 06:37.658
Terence is too sharp.

06:37.701 --> 06:39.877
- Maybe not as much
as you think.

06:39.921 --> 06:41.139
- What do you mean?

06:41.183 --> 06:43.925
- I saw him on the phone
just now.

06:43.968 --> 06:46.971
He was pacing, upset.

06:47.015 --> 06:48.712
He seemed distracted,

06:48.756 --> 06:50.758
like, not like himself.

06:50.801 --> 06:52.455
I'm telling you, Megan,

06:52.499 --> 06:55.066
something is going on with him.

06:55.110 --> 06:58.026
- What's the most dangerous
thing you've ever done?

06:58.069 --> 07:00.637
- I hitchhiked from Hoboken
to Virginia Beach.

07:00.681 --> 07:03.118
- What's your greatest fear?

07:03.161 --> 07:05.729
- Maximum security prison.

07:08.732 --> 07:10.212
- Thoughts?

07:10.255 --> 07:13.476
- I'm being glib, defensive.

07:13.520 --> 07:15.086
- I see fear,

07:15.130 --> 07:17.567
someone hiding real pain,

07:17.611 --> 07:18.786
a pain you're still hiding.

07:18.829 --> 07:20.962
- No, that's...

07:21.005 --> 07:22.572
I'm not.

07:22.616 --> 07:24.008
I worked through all that.

07:24.052 --> 07:26.184
We worked through that
together at the Facility.

07:26.228 --> 07:27.751
- Megan...

07:27.795 --> 07:28.970
- I worked through
what I did to my brother.

07:29.013 --> 07:30.928
I learned to cope
with my anger,

07:30.972 --> 07:32.495
my choice to go back.

07:32.539 --> 07:34.584
- Megan, our work at
the Facility isn't a cure,

07:34.628 --> 07:35.933
it's a process,

07:35.977 --> 07:37.587
and it doesn't stop
the second you leave.

07:37.631 --> 07:39.241
Something is...
Ä°s still triggering you,

07:39.284 --> 07:41.112
and it's manifesting itself
in physical pain.

07:41.156 --> 07:43.593
- I told you, the stomach pains
are gone, and I don't...

07:43.637 --> 07:45.595
- I don't believe you.

07:45.639 --> 07:47.118
Do you wanna get better?

07:47.162 --> 07:49.512
Then you have to start
being honest with me.

07:50.992 --> 07:52.733
Let's go back to
your greatest fear.

07:52.776 --> 07:54.822
Maximum security prison,
that was bullshit, wasn't it?

07:54.865 --> 07:57.781
- The question is bullshit.
- Really? How so?

07:57.825 --> 07:59.827
- It's not about the answer.

07:59.870 --> 08:01.742
It... it's about how you act.

08:01.785 --> 08:04.614
It... it's about
how you react when...

08:04.658 --> 08:06.529
Ow.

08:06.573 --> 08:08.096
- Megan, you okay?

08:08.139 --> 08:10.141
I'm fine. I'm fine.

08:10.185 --> 08:11.752
- Okay, just breathe.

08:11.795 --> 08:13.928
Center yourself...

08:13.971 --> 08:16.800
- Let it pass through you.

08:16.844 --> 08:18.802
Megan, the imperatives
are only bullshit

08:18.846 --> 08:20.761
if you want them to be,

08:20.804 --> 08:22.676
but if you're open to
exposing your deepest self,

08:22.719 --> 08:26.549
those answers can be incredibly
potent and revealing.

08:26.593 --> 08:28.116
So tell me again,

08:28.159 --> 08:29.900
what is your greatest fear?

08:29.944 --> 08:31.162
- Can we just take
a break, please?

08:31.206 --> 08:33.904
- Don't think.
Just speak. Say it.

08:35.078 --> 08:36.211
- Your biggest fear,
what is it?

08:36.254 --> 08:37.647
- You.

08:38.996 --> 08:41.129
You...

08:41.172 --> 08:44.219
control every aspect
of my life:

08:44.261 --> 08:47.004
IHM, the contract...

08:47.048 --> 08:49.006
Kyle.

08:49.050 --> 08:51.052
I live in this constant fear

08:51.095 --> 08:53.141
of disappointing you,

08:53.184 --> 08:55.273
letting you down, and...

08:55.317 --> 08:58.755
And watching it all just...

08:58.799 --> 09:01.236
Watching it all go away.

09:02.890 --> 09:04.239
And on top of that,

09:04.282 --> 09:07.851
I have no idea
who you really are.

09:07.895 --> 09:10.071
So when I'm in
the same room as you,

09:10.114 --> 09:12.595
I find it hard to breathe,

09:12.639 --> 09:14.858
let alone open up to you.

09:22.605 --> 09:23.693
Okay...

09:27.044 --> 09:29.220
Let's go confront your fear.

09:38.665 --> 09:40.623
- Fries here are really good.

09:40.667 --> 09:43.147
- Fries? Okay, noted.

09:49.632 --> 09:51.503
So...

09:51.547 --> 09:53.462
how is this all gonna work?

09:53.505 --> 09:54.637
- Work?

09:54.681 --> 09:56.378
- I... I ask you questions,

09:56.421 --> 09:58.423
and you tell me stuff.

09:58.467 --> 10:00.338
- Well, that's up to you.

10:00.382 --> 10:02.166
This is your opportunity
to get to know me,

10:02.210 --> 10:04.691
so ask me anything you want.
- Okay.

10:06.693 --> 10:08.738
What is your greatest fear?

10:10.697 --> 10:12.786
- Snakes.
- Snakes?

10:12.829 --> 10:14.135
Seriously?
- Yeah, snakes.

10:14.178 --> 10:15.745
- What, are you Indiana Jones?

10:15.789 --> 10:17.573
- Maybe.
- No.

10:17.617 --> 10:19.575
You're deflecting.

10:19.619 --> 10:22.099
- And it's not gonna work.
Don't bullshit me.

10:22.143 --> 10:24.101
What is your greatest fear?

10:26.756 --> 10:28.671
- Don't look at me!
- I'm not looking at you!

10:28.715 --> 10:30.412
- I said, don't look at me!

10:33.328 --> 10:34.764
- You okay?

10:34.808 --> 10:36.461
- Yeah.

10:36.505 --> 10:38.550
- So you two ready to order?

10:38.594 --> 10:40.596
- Uh, yeah, I'll have
the burger, no lettuce, please.

10:42.163 --> 10:43.555
- Club sandwich,

10:43.599 --> 10:45.688
side of fries.

10:45.732 --> 10:48.125
- You took my recommendation.

10:48.169 --> 10:50.824
- You seemed pretty confident.

10:50.867 --> 10:52.477
- I love fries.

10:52.521 --> 10:54.131
It was my favorite food
as a little kid,

10:54.175 --> 10:55.393
and there's a tidbit.

10:55.437 --> 10:58.222
- You as a child,
somehow I...

10:58.266 --> 11:01.225
I find that hard to imagine.
It seems impossible.

11:01.269 --> 11:03.184
- I used to eat them
with butter.

11:03.227 --> 11:04.576
- Fries? Ew.

11:04.620 --> 11:06.230
- Eh, my mom agreed with you.

11:06.274 --> 11:08.624
She, uh... she forbade it.

11:08.668 --> 11:10.757
But I'd do it anyway.

11:10.800 --> 11:13.673
Had issues with authority.

11:13.716 --> 11:15.631
Sound familiar?

11:17.285 --> 11:19.417
Somehow, she always knew
when I was sneaky, though.

11:19.461 --> 11:21.158
Always.

11:21.202 --> 11:23.334
She'd find me in the pantry
with my fries and my butter,

11:23.378 --> 11:25.206
and she'd grab me by the ear

11:25.249 --> 11:27.599
and drag me down the hall,
screaming into the kitchen,

11:27.643 --> 11:29.732
and she'd sit me down,

11:29.776 --> 11:31.734
put a stick of butter
in front of me...

11:33.475 --> 11:35.129
- And make you eat it?

11:35.172 --> 11:36.739
The whole stick of butter?

11:36.783 --> 11:38.741
- A couple times.

11:38.785 --> 11:40.612
- I'm sorry.

11:40.656 --> 11:43.267
Is that story supposed to
make me less scared of you?

11:46.488 --> 11:48.620
- And so I ran,
dropped the gun, and moved,

11:48.664 --> 11:50.535
like something possessed me...

11:50.579 --> 11:52.146
someone.

11:52.189 --> 11:54.104
And I knew I'd never be
that person again,

11:54.148 --> 11:56.672
that little kid that
ate peas one at a time...

12:02.809 --> 12:05.768
And so I ran, dropped the...

12:05.812 --> 12:07.422
Shit!

12:07.465 --> 12:09.337
- Xavier, breathe.

12:09.380 --> 12:11.774
It's okay, all right?
Feel it, don't force it.

12:11.818 --> 12:13.602
- I'm trying.

12:13.645 --> 12:16.126
The words, it's... it's like
they're dying in my mouth.

12:16.170 --> 12:18.128
Put the script down.

12:18.172 --> 12:19.739
- What?
- Script, drop it.

12:19.782 --> 12:21.479
Come over here.

12:23.220 --> 12:24.787
- What, we about
to do trust falls?

12:24.831 --> 12:26.310
Ha, ha.

12:26.354 --> 12:28.878
No, here. Take a seat.

12:28.922 --> 12:31.489
All right, buddy,
let's talk about you.

12:31.533 --> 12:33.187
Forget the fact that
you're about to star

12:33.230 --> 12:34.666
in an amazing motion picture,

12:34.710 --> 12:36.494
directed by a one-of-a-kind
true artistic force...

12:37.713 --> 12:39.236
- You're prepping
for a big show:

12:39.280 --> 12:41.238
concert, thousands of people.

12:41.282 --> 12:43.197
How do you get yourself ready?

12:44.372 --> 12:46.243
- I get angry.

12:47.549 --> 12:49.507
- Angry?

12:50.857 --> 12:52.859
- Rage...

12:52.902 --> 12:54.861
it fires me up.

12:56.253 --> 12:57.515
It's the reason why I'm here.

12:57.559 --> 12:59.866
It's the source of
all my ambition,

12:59.909 --> 13:02.216
my music, my art.

13:04.261 --> 13:05.828
If I'm being honest...

13:05.872 --> 13:07.612
- Please, by all means.

13:07.656 --> 13:09.353
- I was bullied...

13:09.397 --> 13:11.268
as a kid.

13:11.312 --> 13:12.792
Group of older kids
used to jump me

13:12.835 --> 13:14.576
on my way home from school.

13:14.619 --> 13:16.752
And I couldn't tell anybody,
'cause then I'd be a pussy,

13:16.796 --> 13:19.320
so I had to...

13:19.363 --> 13:20.930
internalize it...

13:22.802 --> 13:24.804
Push that shit deep down.

13:24.847 --> 13:26.718
And now...

13:26.762 --> 13:28.720
it burns inside me.

13:32.376 --> 13:34.204
Hey, is something wrong?

13:34.248 --> 13:35.727
- Hm?

13:35.771 --> 13:37.817
No. No, uh, but...

13:37.860 --> 13:40.297
your music, it's...
Ä°t's so sensitive.

13:40.341 --> 13:41.821
I've never felt
any of that rage.

13:41.864 --> 13:43.648
- I don't let it out.

13:43.692 --> 13:46.738
I keep it just below
the surface.

13:46.782 --> 13:48.871
- And what if it comes out?
- It won't.

13:48.915 --> 13:50.525
I'm in charge of it,

13:50.568 --> 13:52.266
and it makes me feel confident.

13:53.833 --> 13:56.705
- That's a dangerous game.

13:56.748 --> 13:59.534
I like a little danger.

14:01.797 --> 14:03.625
- All right, pick up
your script; let's go again.

14:03.668 --> 14:05.670
Remember, feel that anger,
don't play it.

14:05.714 --> 14:07.934
You got me?

14:07.977 --> 14:10.240
- Yeah.

14:15.767 --> 14:17.682
- Well?

14:17.726 --> 14:19.423
- That might just be
the most revolting thing

14:19.467 --> 14:21.512
I've ever put in my mouth.

14:21.556 --> 14:23.601
There's a joke there.
- Mm...

14:23.645 --> 14:25.821
resist the urge.

14:25.865 --> 14:27.475
So...

14:28.955 --> 14:30.521
You and your mom...

14:30.565 --> 14:32.045
- Me and my mom?
Go ahead.

14:32.088 --> 14:33.611
- You still talk to her?

14:33.655 --> 14:35.700
- No, not really.
She's dead, so...

14:35.744 --> 14:38.442
- Sorry.
- No, don't be.

14:38.486 --> 14:40.401
Last time I spoke to her
in... in person,

14:40.444 --> 14:42.011
I was 19.

14:42.055 --> 14:43.621
I told her I wanted
to be an actor,

14:43.665 --> 14:45.580
and she...
did not support that.

14:45.623 --> 14:48.496
- Yeah, Kyle told me
that you used to act.

14:48.539 --> 14:51.412
Always blows my mind.
- Why is that?

14:51.455 --> 14:53.544
- I don't know, you're not
the most emotive person

14:53.588 --> 14:54.937
I've ever met.

14:54.981 --> 14:57.287
- Well, maybe that's
why I'm not Kyle West.

14:57.331 --> 14:59.028
- Does that bother you,

14:59.072 --> 15:00.725
not being Kyle West?

15:00.769 --> 15:02.379
- No, it doesn't.

15:02.423 --> 15:04.425
- Oh, come on,
you must be a little jealous.

15:04.468 --> 15:06.601
- Why would you say that?

15:06.644 --> 15:08.820
- Being in the shadows
your whole life,

15:08.864 --> 15:10.344
that can't always be easy.

15:10.387 --> 15:12.563
- No, I... I embrace that.

15:12.607 --> 15:15.871
Guiding people, helping them
fulfill their true potential,

15:15.915 --> 15:17.438
that's my talent.

15:17.481 --> 15:18.961
- But once they reach
that potential,

15:19.005 --> 15:21.616
they get all the glory.

15:21.659 --> 15:24.053
- Well...
it does take confidence

15:24.097 --> 15:25.707
to stand next to
someone like Kyle.

15:25.750 --> 15:28.101
The heat around him can
get a little overwhelming,

15:28.144 --> 15:30.059
but you certainly get that.

15:30.103 --> 15:31.843
- I'm getting married to it...

15:31.887 --> 15:33.889
the heat.

15:33.933 --> 15:37.023
Wedding of the century.
- Yeah.

15:37.066 --> 15:39.939
- It's all been
worth it, though,

15:39.982 --> 15:41.549
existing in Kyle's orbit,

15:41.592 --> 15:43.551
watching his... his journey,
his rise.

15:43.594 --> 15:46.032
It's one of the great joys
of my life.

15:46.075 --> 15:47.990
- You really love him,
don't you?

15:48.034 --> 15:49.687
- Yeah, I do very much.

15:49.731 --> 15:51.820
He's... he's like a son to me.

15:51.863 --> 15:53.561
- All right,
you're not that old.

15:55.911 --> 15:58.000
- You and DeAnn ever thought
about having one?

15:58.044 --> 15:59.915
A child?

15:59.959 --> 16:03.005
- Came up early on.
- And?

16:03.049 --> 16:06.139
- We, uh... we... we both agreed
it didn't really fit for us.

16:08.141 --> 16:09.881
You disapprove?

16:09.925 --> 16:11.448
- Mm.

16:11.492 --> 16:12.928
We all have a choice to make.

16:12.972 --> 16:16.062
We all aren't meant
to be parents.

16:16.105 --> 16:18.151
What about your own dad?

16:18.194 --> 16:21.023
- What about him?
- Were you two close?

16:21.067 --> 16:22.894
- He died also, when I was six.

16:22.938 --> 16:25.027
You seem to be fixated
on my childhood.

16:25.071 --> 16:26.594
Why do you think that is?

16:26.637 --> 16:28.509
- We're talking about you,
remember?

16:31.077 --> 16:32.730
Fine.

16:34.210 --> 16:36.169
I don't know, maybe...

16:38.954 --> 16:40.869
Maybe me pretending
there's a little boy

16:40.912 --> 16:42.827
sitting across from me

16:42.871 --> 16:44.829
makes you less terrifying.

16:44.873 --> 16:46.570
- Okay, whatever helps.

16:46.614 --> 16:47.963
- It does...

16:48.007 --> 16:49.965
'cause you're just a person,

16:50.009 --> 16:51.880
scared as the rest of us.

16:54.883 --> 16:56.885
- Yes, that's true,
but my fear, Megan,

16:56.928 --> 16:59.148
I've worked very hard
to control it,

16:59.192 --> 17:00.541
to harness it.

17:00.584 --> 17:02.064
- Have you, though?
- I have.

17:02.108 --> 17:04.762
- I don't think so.
- Why is that?

17:04.806 --> 17:06.895
- 'Cause you never
answered my question.

17:06.938 --> 17:09.070
- Which?
- Your greatest fear.

17:09.115 --> 17:11.030
- Yes, I did.
- No, you didn't.

17:11.073 --> 17:13.641
And when I pressed you,
I saw it; you got lost.

17:13.684 --> 17:17.036
Like a little boy,
you looked terrified.

17:17.079 --> 17:19.167
What are you afraid of,
Terence?

17:20.996 --> 17:23.694
- We should get the check.
- No, no, no, no, say it.

17:23.738 --> 17:25.653
Let go; be yourself.
- I am being myself.

17:25.695 --> 17:27.742
- No, you're being
who you think I need you to be,

17:27.785 --> 17:29.874
which is very generous,
but stop.

17:29.918 --> 17:31.528
Rest.

17:31.572 --> 17:33.095
Take a rest.

17:33.139 --> 17:34.966
Tell me.

17:35.010 --> 17:37.447
Greatest fear.

17:37.491 --> 17:39.449
- Do I have your word
you won't tell anyone else?

17:39.493 --> 17:41.016
- Of course.

17:41.060 --> 17:43.192
- Not even Kyle?
- No, not even Kyle.

17:45.107 --> 17:46.891
- Last week,
someone tried to kill me.

17:46.935 --> 17:48.676
- What? Terence...

17:48.719 --> 17:50.156
- A man approached me
in a parking lot,

17:50.199 --> 17:51.853
he forced me down
to the ground,

17:51.896 --> 17:53.028
he pressed a gun
against my head,

17:53.072 --> 17:54.160
and he pulled the trigger.

17:54.203 --> 17:56.031
And in that moment,

17:56.075 --> 17:58.207
I thought I was gonna die.

17:58.251 --> 18:00.035
I was sure of it.

18:00.079 --> 18:01.123
- Have the police...

18:01.167 --> 18:02.907
- No, they...
They can't find him.

18:02.951 --> 18:05.214
They probably never will.
And there's nothing...

18:05.258 --> 18:07.260
There's nothing
I can do about it.

18:07.303 --> 18:10.480
And that feeling...

18:10.524 --> 18:12.526
that feeling

18:12.569 --> 18:15.094
of... powerlessness...

18:17.096 --> 18:18.662
It's...

18:20.316 --> 18:22.188
- How your mother
made you feel.

18:26.801 --> 18:28.150
- Every day.

18:37.333 --> 18:39.074
- And he hasn't told
anyone else?

18:39.118 --> 18:40.641
No...

18:40.684 --> 18:41.990
- I think he's embarrassed.

18:42.033 --> 18:44.253
If there's one takeaway
from last night,

18:44.297 --> 18:47.604
it's that Terence does not
like to be vulnerable.

18:47.648 --> 18:49.345
But he was...

18:49.389 --> 18:51.130
to me.

18:51.173 --> 18:54.133
I'm taking him out for drinks
tomorrow night.

18:54.176 --> 18:56.396
He's exposed...

18:56.439 --> 18:59.138
and I need to take advantage.

18:59.181 --> 19:01.879
- Megan...
- What?

19:01.923 --> 19:05.100
- The guy is traumatized.
- Wh... what?

19:05.144 --> 19:07.929
- PTSD. Maybe you shouldn't...
- Wh... the guy?

19:07.972 --> 19:10.671
This is Terence.

19:10.714 --> 19:12.890
- Okay, fine.

19:12.934 --> 19:14.414
No one should go through
something like that.

19:14.457 --> 19:15.893
It's awful.

19:15.937 --> 19:18.896
But this is not a good man.

19:20.115 --> 19:22.944
- Yeah. I know that.

19:22.987 --> 19:25.251
No, I know. It's...

19:25.294 --> 19:27.731
Just be careful.

19:27.775 --> 19:29.080
- I will.

19:32.432 --> 19:34.347
- Xavier, we love your music!

19:34.390 --> 19:37.088
- Sorry. DeAnn's idea.

19:37.132 --> 19:39.178
- Hey, it's cool.
We totally understand.

19:39.221 --> 19:41.005
- Yeah. Anyway...

19:41.049 --> 19:44.270
physical stuff,
daunting, for sure.

19:44.313 --> 19:47.229
The emotional shit, though?
I can't freakin' wait.

19:47.273 --> 19:49.057
- I'm loving this
newfound confidence.

19:49.100 --> 19:51.059
- Well, thank my director
over there.

19:51.102 --> 19:52.713
He's been working with me
around the clock,

19:52.756 --> 19:54.236
helping me dig into
my performance,

19:54.280 --> 19:56.195
turning me into an actor.

19:56.238 --> 19:58.240
- Oh, come on, man,
you were born for this.

19:58.284 --> 20:00.199
We're just bringing it
out of you.

20:00.242 --> 20:02.244
It's been really exciting,
though, you know?

20:02.288 --> 20:04.420
Working these big
emotional scenes

20:04.464 --> 20:06.466
and finding the personal.

20:06.509 --> 20:08.207
It's been super helpful.

20:08.250 --> 20:09.817
You should join us.

20:09.860 --> 20:11.949
- Uh, yeah,
that would be fantastic.

20:11.993 --> 20:15.170
- Oh, I... I don't wanna
break up a good thing.

20:15.214 --> 20:16.780
- What, this whole
sausage-fest going on?

20:16.824 --> 20:18.304
- Wow, where did
that come from?

20:22.133 --> 20:23.352
- Big scene.

20:23.396 --> 20:25.224
Hospital;

20:25.267 --> 20:27.051
Clyde says good-bye
to her sister.

20:27.095 --> 20:29.053
- I'm well aware.

20:29.097 --> 20:31.404
I've been prepping
the hell out of that one.

20:31.447 --> 20:33.057
- You know, maybe you could
draw from the stuff,

20:33.101 --> 20:35.930
uh, with your mother.

20:35.973 --> 20:38.062
- Yeah... Kyle.

20:38.106 --> 20:39.368
That's a good idea.

20:46.114 --> 20:47.420
- So then, suddenly, he's up,

20:47.463 --> 20:50.074
and he's pacing
literally all over the room,

20:50.118 --> 20:52.381
and I look over at Kyle,
and he looks so helpless.

20:54.078 --> 20:56.298
I wanted to laugh,
because it was...

20:58.779 --> 21:00.781
Okay, I guess you really
had to be there.

21:02.217 --> 21:04.088
- I have to go back to Napa.

21:04.132 --> 21:06.221
- I thought you were planning
on staying through the month.

21:06.265 --> 21:08.963
- One of our major buyers
pulled out last night,

21:09.006 --> 21:12.488
so it's a bit of a
all-hands-on-deck situation.

21:12.532 --> 21:14.882
- So when you're done
with all that,

21:14.925 --> 21:16.840
you can fly right back,
though, right?

21:16.884 --> 21:19.278
- It's not like slapping
a Band-Aid on a cut.

21:19.321 --> 21:20.931
I'm needed there.

21:20.975 --> 21:22.933
- I'm sorry.

21:22.977 --> 21:25.371
I guess I'm just...

21:25.414 --> 21:27.547
not ready for you to leave yet.

21:27.590 --> 21:29.375
- Hey...

21:29.418 --> 21:33.161
This has been amazing,

21:33.204 --> 21:36.120
you, me existing in this...

21:36.164 --> 21:37.252
This bubble,

21:37.296 --> 21:39.472
this very fun and sexy bubble.

21:39.515 --> 21:41.212
- Please don't do that.

21:41.256 --> 21:42.213
Please.

21:42.257 --> 21:45.216
Don't diminish this, us.

21:45.260 --> 21:46.522
- I'm not.

21:46.566 --> 21:48.568
Babe, I'm telling you
I have to go.

21:48.611 --> 21:50.787
I've been here for months,
and my...

21:50.831 --> 21:52.441
My business is suffering.

21:52.485 --> 21:54.574
- Or you just got scared.

21:54.617 --> 21:56.271
- Okay...

21:56.315 --> 21:59.318
If you're gonna take this
personally and lash out...

21:59.361 --> 22:00.971
- Mason, of course
it's personal.

22:01.015 --> 22:03.409
This is what you do; this is
what you've always done.

22:03.452 --> 22:05.454
We are closer than
we've been in decades,

22:05.498 --> 22:08.457
so you run.
- I never ran.

22:08.501 --> 22:11.199
You made a choice back then.
- I made a choice?

22:11.242 --> 22:13.070
N... no, you pushed me away.

22:13.114 --> 22:14.376
- You wanted Terence,

22:14.420 --> 22:16.509
this career, this life,

22:16.552 --> 22:19.425
so stop it with
the revisionist history crap.

22:21.252 --> 22:23.167
I have a life.

22:23.211 --> 22:24.865
I built one.

22:24.908 --> 22:28.434
My business, it matters to me.

22:28.477 --> 22:30.958
I wish I could stay,
but I can't.

22:32.568 --> 22:35.136
- Guess I didn't realize
that topic was so off-limits.

22:35.179 --> 22:36.572
- My dead mom?

22:36.616 --> 22:38.400
Yeah, not my favorite topic
for happy hour.

22:38.444 --> 22:40.837
- Okay, point made. I'm sorry.
Can we please drop it?

22:40.881 --> 22:42.839
- It just seemed
a little hostile,

22:42.883 --> 22:45.015
the way you brought it up.

22:45.059 --> 22:46.843
- Well, that's
not what I meant.

22:46.887 --> 22:49.019
- Or, I don't know, like you
were testing me or something.

22:49.063 --> 22:50.847
- We are two days out, Megan.

22:50.891 --> 22:52.501
I just wanna make sure
that you're ready.

22:52.545 --> 22:54.416
- Meaning you don't think
I will be.

22:54.460 --> 22:57.332
- You seem distracted, okay?

23:02.250 --> 23:04.078
Not that I blame you.

23:04.121 --> 23:05.296
We're planning a wedding,

23:05.340 --> 23:06.863
you're about to
star in a movie,

23:06.907 --> 23:08.212
and on top of all that,

23:08.256 --> 23:09.562
you're with Terence
half the time,

23:09.605 --> 23:10.563
trying to explore your psyche.
- Terence?

23:10.606 --> 23:12.129
I collapsed in public, Kyle,

23:12.173 --> 23:13.435
and he's helping me to figure...

23:13.479 --> 23:14.958
- Yeah, I know,
and I'm glad that he is,

23:15.002 --> 23:17.874
but a lot's riding
on your performance.

23:17.918 --> 23:19.441
- You're afraid I'm gonna suck.

23:19.485 --> 23:20.529
That's not what I said.

23:20.573 --> 23:22.052
- You implied it.

23:22.096 --> 23:24.490
I wanted to rehearse
with you weeks ago,

23:24.533 --> 23:26.274
but you didn't think
it was necessary.

23:26.317 --> 23:27.667
- Yeah, that was before
you barely performed

23:27.710 --> 23:29.408
at the table read.

23:29.451 --> 23:31.192
- The table read?

23:31.235 --> 23:32.976
Wh... I was...

23:33.020 --> 23:34.674
- Flat, emotionless.

23:34.717 --> 23:37.111
- I was taking notes,
finding moments.

23:37.154 --> 23:38.939
I didn't think
it was a live show.

23:38.982 --> 23:41.028
- Come on, Megan,
don't be so naive.

23:41.071 --> 23:43.378
You have never carried
a film before, all right?

23:43.422 --> 23:44.597
There's a lot on the line.

23:44.640 --> 23:46.120
- I am well aware
of the stakes,

23:46.163 --> 23:47.426
but thank you so much
for reminding me

23:47.469 --> 23:49.079
over and over again.

23:50.603 --> 23:53.432
Don't you trust me?

23:53.475 --> 23:55.477
- It's kinda hard
when you shut me out.

23:55.521 --> 23:58.262
- Stop putting this on me.

23:59.742 --> 24:01.701
We both know
what this is about.

24:03.485 --> 24:06.053
You're scared.
- Okay.

24:06.096 --> 24:08.272
- You're scared shitless
that you're gonna mess this up.

24:08.316 --> 24:10.361
- Hey, Megan,
I am trying to help you here.

24:10.405 --> 24:13.321
- No, no, you are projecting
your fear onto me.

24:13.364 --> 24:15.018
And I hate to
break this to you,

24:15.062 --> 24:17.586
but I am gonna be ready
in two days, prepared.

24:17.630 --> 24:19.936
I am working on my shit
with Terence,

24:19.980 --> 24:21.503
so why don't you
back the hell off

24:21.547 --> 24:23.505
and go deal with yours?

24:41.175 --> 24:43.612
- Good morning.

24:43.656 --> 24:45.919
- Morning.

24:45.962 --> 24:48.138
You still mad?

24:48.182 --> 24:51.141
- I'm fine. Just, busy day.

24:53.579 --> 24:55.145
Look...

24:55.189 --> 24:58.235
we don't have to do
the whole apology thing.

24:58.279 --> 25:00.977
We both said things last night
that we didn't mean.

25:01.021 --> 25:02.849
Stressful time, right?

25:02.892 --> 25:04.938
- Yeah.

25:04.981 --> 25:07.070
I do trust you.

25:09.551 --> 25:11.161
You know that, right?

25:12.902 --> 25:15.688
- Yeah.

25:15.731 --> 25:17.559
I'll see you later.

25:21.607 --> 25:23.173
Hey, Terence.

25:23.217 --> 25:25.741
Sorry to bother you.
- Not at all. Come in.

25:25.785 --> 25:27.787
- So...

25:27.830 --> 25:29.702
I have some good news
and some bad news.

25:29.745 --> 25:31.181
Which do you want first?

25:31.225 --> 25:33.836
- Oh, come on, you're better
than that question.

25:33.880 --> 25:37.187
- Well... we closed the deal
with Scholastic Associates.

25:37.231 --> 25:38.667
- Good, finally.

25:38.711 --> 25:41.061
- However,
the campus you scouted

25:41.104 --> 25:42.715
for the First Life Initiative,

25:42.758 --> 25:45.021
we've hit a bit of a snag.

25:45.065 --> 25:47.546
A local environmental group
filed a complaint

25:47.589 --> 25:48.851
to block the sale.

25:48.895 --> 25:51.245
It's bullshit,
and we'll fight it.

25:52.333 --> 25:55.858
But these kinds of things can
get trapped in lower courts

25:55.902 --> 25:59.035
for a long time... years.

25:59.079 --> 26:00.776
- We're trying to do
something here,

26:00.820 --> 26:03.257
help children explore,
nurture their better selves.

26:03.300 --> 26:06.086
Why can't people see that?

26:08.915 --> 26:10.699
- I see it.

26:14.268 --> 26:17.793
I spent years...

26:17.837 --> 26:20.361
My entire career up until now,

26:20.404 --> 26:23.843
feeling like what I was doing
had no purpose,

26:23.886 --> 26:25.801
but now, working with you,

26:25.845 --> 26:28.108
I feel like I have this focus.

26:28.151 --> 26:31.764
And I saw what you do
up at the Facility,

26:31.807 --> 26:33.243
how you help people.

26:33.287 --> 26:34.810
And now with First Life,

26:34.854 --> 26:37.726
I just... I know
I believe in this,

26:37.770 --> 26:40.250
what we're doing.

26:40.294 --> 26:42.818
I'm not giving up.

26:47.127 --> 26:49.869
- I might have someone
who can help us.

26:49.912 --> 26:51.827
He's off the books,
not IHM,

26:51.871 --> 26:54.047
but he's someone I...

26:54.090 --> 26:56.658
outsource certain problems to.

27:01.097 --> 27:03.012
- We're not waiting years.

27:10.977 --> 27:13.240
- Hey, cut yourself a break.

27:13.283 --> 27:15.938
If Nasim and I made a movie
together...

27:15.982 --> 27:17.766
Ä°t would not be pretty.

27:17.810 --> 27:19.115
- Why's that?

27:19.159 --> 27:22.684
- Land mines... everywhere.

27:22.728 --> 27:24.686
- Land mines...

27:24.730 --> 27:27.341
No, I can't step
on any land mines.

27:27.384 --> 27:30.257
This movie is too important.

27:32.433 --> 27:34.130
You know what you said earlier

27:34.174 --> 27:37.003
about rage?

27:37.046 --> 27:38.787
I get that.

27:38.831 --> 27:41.094
I really get it.

27:43.009 --> 27:45.098
- Kyle West has rage issues?

27:45.141 --> 27:46.708
Come on.

27:46.752 --> 27:48.841
Wh... what do you have to
be angry about, huh?

27:50.233 --> 27:52.671
- Kyle freakin' West?

27:52.714 --> 27:54.324
Holy shit.

27:54.368 --> 27:56.152
I love you...
You're so badass!

27:56.196 --> 27:58.024
- Thanks, man.
- No doubt, no doubt.

27:58.067 --> 27:59.678
- Dude, can we hang?

27:59.721 --> 28:01.680
- Uh, sorry, we're having
a private conversation,

28:01.723 --> 28:02.985
but thank you for
the kind words.

28:03.029 --> 28:04.160
I appreciate it.
- Oh, come on, come on.

28:04.204 --> 28:05.945
A drink, a selfie,
a little shot.

28:05.988 --> 28:07.250
What's a little
something, something?

28:07.294 --> 28:08.338
- Not today, boys. Sorry.
- Kyle, come on.

28:08.382 --> 28:11.167
Get me in your next film?

28:11.211 --> 28:13.082
Ah, all right,
never mind, never mind.

28:13.126 --> 28:15.302
Let's go.

28:15.345 --> 28:17.347
- What do you say?
One more pitcher?

28:17.391 --> 28:19.698
- Eh, not today.
Big day tomorrow.

28:19.741 --> 28:20.960
- You need to unwind.

28:21.003 --> 28:22.875
You scared me
a little just now.

28:32.362 --> 28:35.191
Mason, it's me.

28:35.235 --> 28:38.368
I'm sorry for how I acted
the other night.

28:38.412 --> 28:41.197
I don't wanna go back
to once a year.

28:41.241 --> 28:42.895
I can't.

28:44.810 --> 28:46.725
I need more.

28:47.943 --> 28:50.511
So I'm gonna clear my weekend,

28:50.554 --> 28:52.905
and I'm gonna come up to Napa,

28:52.948 --> 28:54.776
and we'll figure this out...

28:54.820 --> 28:57.039
okay?

28:57.083 --> 29:00.216
I'm in all night.
Call me back.

29:03.916 --> 29:05.221
- To your recovery.

29:05.265 --> 29:07.223
- To both our recoveries.

29:14.491 --> 29:16.798
How's that going,
your recovery?

29:16.842 --> 29:19.061
- Fine. You don't
have to worry about me.

29:19.105 --> 29:20.454
- Someone has to.

29:20.497 --> 29:22.499
- I can worry about myself.

29:22.543 --> 29:24.110
- That sounds lonely.

29:24.153 --> 29:26.286
- No. It's better that way.

29:26.329 --> 29:28.375
It's easier to...

29:28.418 --> 29:30.943
- Easier to what?

29:30.986 --> 29:32.988
- To protect
the people that need me,

29:33.032 --> 29:34.903
the ones I make sacrifices for.

29:34.947 --> 29:36.426
I've gotta be strong for them.

29:38.515 --> 29:40.343
- Not tonight.

29:42.171 --> 29:44.304
Lourdes, two more.

29:49.875 --> 29:51.267
- You said that
to the director?

29:51.311 --> 29:53.313
On your first film?
- First feature-length.

29:53.356 --> 29:54.967
I did a couple student shorts,

29:55.010 --> 29:56.403
but, you know, pretentious
black-and-white bullshit.

29:56.446 --> 29:57.970
- Man, you have balls.

29:58.013 --> 30:00.059
"We can't move on
until we have it.

30:00.102 --> 30:01.930
Do you think we have it?"

30:03.932 --> 30:07.022
- Ky-le! I mean...
... I mean Kyle.

30:07.066 --> 30:08.850
Mr. West!

30:08.894 --> 30:11.070
- Mr. West-Kyle-West-
Kyle-West-Kyle-West!

30:11.113 --> 30:13.550
Kyle West, you so pretty.
Like, what the hell?

30:13.594 --> 30:16.075
- Oh, Kyle... Kyle, can you
autograph my napkin, please?

30:16.118 --> 30:17.772
Kyle West, sir?

30:17.816 --> 30:19.252
With your dick?

30:21.080 --> 30:22.951
- That's a good one, man.
You are clever!

30:22.995 --> 30:24.561
- Xavier, hey,
it's not worth it.

30:24.605 --> 30:27.434
- What'd you say to me?
- Hey, take it easy, man.

30:27.477 --> 30:29.436
- You heard me.
- Xavier, hey, take it easy.

30:29.479 --> 30:31.090
- No, I didn't hear you, see,

30:31.133 --> 30:32.831
'cause the... the sound quality
in this place is shit.

30:32.874 --> 30:35.877
- Okay, here you go:
You are clever.

30:35.921 --> 30:37.574
Now sit down
in that chair, asshole.

30:37.618 --> 30:39.533
- Oh, I'm the asshole?
You're dead, little pussy.

30:39.576 --> 30:41.317
- Hit me.
- Jesus, Xavier.

30:45.017 --> 30:46.409
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

30:46.453 --> 30:48.455
What do you think
you're doing, you jackass?

30:48.498 --> 30:50.283
- Xavier, you okay?

30:50.326 --> 30:51.937
- Yeah.
- Let go!

30:51.980 --> 30:53.112
- Come on,
let's get out of here.

31:05.951 --> 31:08.301
You're not a bad dancer.

31:08.344 --> 31:09.998
- Ha-ha, stop lying.
It's regressive.

31:23.185 --> 31:25.274
What you said before

31:25.318 --> 31:29.148
about not wanting to
compromise anyone else,

31:29.191 --> 31:31.890
what did you mean?

31:31.933 --> 31:34.109
- Nothing in particular.

31:34.153 --> 31:36.024
- It didn't feel that way.

31:37.983 --> 31:40.333
- Just certain things
I've done,

31:40.376 --> 31:42.944
choices that I have to
live with.

31:42.988 --> 31:45.904
- That you regret?
- Oh, we all have regret.

31:45.947 --> 31:49.255
You said that yourself
back at the Facility.

31:49.298 --> 31:51.170
- Yes, I did,

31:51.213 --> 31:55.348
and that's why I opened up
about my regrets.

31:55.391 --> 31:59.918
And in doing that,
exploring what I had done,

31:59.961 --> 32:03.530
talking, it freed me.

32:03.573 --> 32:05.488
- Then why are we here?

32:05.532 --> 32:07.969
- Because, you needed to...
- No, no, we're here

32:08.013 --> 32:10.319
because you collapsed
at a public event.

32:10.363 --> 32:12.582
How's that free?

32:12.626 --> 32:14.323
- Okay, but your choices...

32:14.367 --> 32:17.413
- Why are you
so interested in me?

32:17.457 --> 32:20.155
- I'm just trying to help you.

32:20.199 --> 32:23.506
- I thought I was
your greatest fear.

32:23.550 --> 32:26.292
Remind me why that is again.

32:26.335 --> 32:28.903
- Because you...
- Because I'm an enigma, right?

32:28.947 --> 32:31.210
'Cause I control
every aspect of your life.

32:33.038 --> 32:34.169
But I'm starting to think

32:34.213 --> 32:36.345
that's just a projection,
isn't it?

32:36.389 --> 32:38.260
Your fear of me.

32:38.304 --> 32:41.002
I'm just a stand-in.

32:41.046 --> 32:44.484
I'm just a stand-in for
the true enigma in your life:

32:44.527 --> 32:46.965
the person who abandoned you

32:47.008 --> 32:49.489
when you were a baby,

32:49.532 --> 32:52.013
left you and your mother,

32:52.057 --> 32:54.233
because he wanted
nothing to do with you.

32:56.626 --> 32:58.150
- Wait, what are you...

32:58.193 --> 33:01.240
Are you talking
about my father?

33:01.283 --> 33:03.024
That's not why he left.

33:03.068 --> 33:04.591
- No?

33:04.634 --> 33:07.376
- No.

33:07.420 --> 33:09.248
- Then why did he?

33:11.163 --> 33:14.122
You don't know, do you?

33:14.166 --> 33:15.950
You don't know.

33:18.605 --> 33:20.694
My father abandoned me too.

33:20.737 --> 33:23.044
He dropped dead of a heart
attack when he was 40,

33:23.088 --> 33:24.437
and I hated him.

33:24.480 --> 33:26.265
I hated him for leaving me

33:26.308 --> 33:28.484
with that woman
who controlled me,

33:28.528 --> 33:31.139
and that experience,
that hate,

33:31.183 --> 33:35.578
it dictated every choice
I made from that moment on.

33:35.622 --> 33:37.667
It defined me.

33:37.711 --> 33:40.105
It's who I am.

33:40.148 --> 33:42.281
And I think your father
leaving has defined you.

33:42.324 --> 33:44.109
It's who you are,

33:44.152 --> 33:46.198
or at least
who you think you are.

33:46.241 --> 33:47.677
You are a person

33:47.721 --> 33:49.679
that other people leave,
isn't that right?

33:49.723 --> 33:51.725
I need to get some air.

33:53.596 --> 33:56.469
- Your mother abandoned
you too, didn't she?

33:56.512 --> 33:59.776
And after she died,
what's the first thing you did?

33:59.820 --> 34:01.474
- I can't... I can't talk...

34:01.517 --> 34:03.084
I can't...

34:06.131 --> 34:07.697
- You traveled across the world

34:07.741 --> 34:10.657
to confront the step-brother
who abused you,

34:10.699 --> 34:14.007
and then also left you.

34:14.052 --> 34:16.097
And what kind of a person
agrees to a contract marriage?

34:16.141 --> 34:18.447
- Enough!

34:18.491 --> 34:20.667
- A person who needs it,

34:20.710 --> 34:22.364
who feels worthless,

34:22.408 --> 34:24.322
who hates herself.

34:24.366 --> 34:26.760
Megan, you're so angry,

34:26.803 --> 34:28.152
and you've been running away

34:28.196 --> 34:29.589
from that anger
your entire life,

34:29.632 --> 34:31.330
but it's catching up to you,

34:31.373 --> 34:34.246
and if you don't turn around
and confront it

34:34.289 --> 34:36.074
and take control of it,

34:36.117 --> 34:39.728
it will keep eating you up
from the inside.

34:39.773 --> 34:42.036
Trust me...

34:42.080 --> 34:44.125
I know, Megan...

34:44.168 --> 34:45.779
because you and I...

34:45.822 --> 34:48.172
are the same.

34:52.612 --> 34:53.873
You all right?

34:53.917 --> 34:54.962
- Yeah, I'm good.
- Huh?

34:55.005 --> 34:56.224
- Man, I'm good!

35:00.098 --> 35:02.056
- Everybody back up now!

35:02.100 --> 35:04.580
I know, we never should've been
in that bar in the first place.

35:04.624 --> 35:05.625
Enough!

35:07.235 --> 35:08.889
What, that's it?

35:08.932 --> 35:10.543
Where's my lecture?

35:10.586 --> 35:12.284
- Not in the mood.

35:38.266 --> 35:39.833
- Ta-da!

35:39.876 --> 35:42.140
- Oh, my God,
you didn't have to...

35:42.183 --> 35:44.185
- I wanted to.
This is a big deal.

35:44.229 --> 35:45.926
- Thank you.
- Congrats on your first day.

35:47.145 --> 35:49.059
- Uh, could you,
uh, hold these?

35:49.103 --> 35:51.366
Yeah, I'll...
I'll just be a second.

35:52.411 --> 35:54.978
- So how'd it go last night?

35:55.022 --> 35:56.937
What happened? You okay?

35:56.980 --> 35:58.895
- I'm fine. I'm just...

35:58.939 --> 36:00.375
I'm regretting the whole thing.

36:00.419 --> 36:02.943
I... I stayed out really late,
and now I feel off.

36:02.986 --> 36:05.206
And...
- Megan...

36:05.250 --> 36:06.990
Big day.

36:07.034 --> 36:09.123
You ready?
- I am.

36:09.167 --> 36:10.951
- Great.

36:10.994 --> 36:13.693
By the way, our little
problem's been taken care of.

36:13.736 --> 36:16.783
- Okay.
That's a relief.

36:16.826 --> 36:19.699
- What problem?
What is he talking about?

36:19.742 --> 36:21.353
- Nothing important.

36:21.396 --> 36:23.093
I gotta get to work.
- Okay.

36:23.137 --> 36:25.095
- You are gonna be great.
- Thank you.

36:26.706 --> 36:28.664
All right, bye.
- Bye.

36:31.667 --> 36:34.409
- Okay, picture's up!
Final touches.

36:35.976 --> 36:37.195
- You heard her.

36:37.238 --> 36:39.893
- That's 3 1/2. It's good.

36:39.936 --> 36:41.721
- Quiet on the set!

36:41.764 --> 36:43.984
- Hey. 'Kay, um...

36:45.420 --> 36:48.249
Does it look okay?
- Mm-hmm.

36:48.293 --> 36:50.164
- Thanks.
- Where's that mic I want?

36:50.208 --> 36:51.818
- Thank you.

36:51.861 --> 36:53.211
'Kay.

36:53.254 --> 36:54.690
Good.

36:54.734 --> 36:56.257
Thanks.

36:56.301 --> 36:59.260
- You all good? Good.

36:59.304 --> 37:01.306
- Let's put this up.

37:01.349 --> 37:04.961
Here you go.
- Second team, stand by!

37:05.005 --> 37:07.312
- Ready to go, guys!
- Hey.

37:09.879 --> 37:11.185
- Bell up!

37:11.229 --> 37:12.665
And roll sound.

37:19.454 --> 37:22.022
- 87, take one.
A and B calling mark.

37:25.112 --> 37:27.245
- Hey, okay...

37:27.288 --> 37:28.898
Is this... am I in
the right frame? Okay.

37:28.942 --> 37:30.378
- You're great
right there, Megan.

37:36.950 --> 37:38.168
- All right.

37:38.212 --> 37:40.432
And... action!

37:43.043 --> 37:45.219
- I'm here.

37:45.263 --> 37:47.265
It's me, Clyde.

37:48.875 --> 37:52.879
Randi, I know I... I haven't
called in a long time,

37:52.922 --> 37:55.011
and that's on me.

37:55.055 --> 37:57.840
That's something that I'll...

37:57.884 --> 37:59.886
I'll have to carry with me.
I'll always...

37:59.929 --> 38:01.975
I'm sorry, can we roll back?

38:05.544 --> 38:08.416
- Uh, do you wanna cut or...

38:10.375 --> 38:12.377
- No. Back to one.

38:20.994 --> 38:22.125
All right.

38:22.169 --> 38:24.867
And... action!

38:26.434 --> 38:28.262
- I'm here.

38:29.959 --> 38:32.092
It's me, Clyde.

38:32.135 --> 38:34.224
Randi, I know we haven't...

38:34.268 --> 38:36.226
spoken in a long time,

38:36.270 --> 38:37.967
and that's on me.

38:38.011 --> 38:41.319
That's something
I'll always carry with me.

38:42.537 --> 38:45.279
I'll always carry it with me.

38:45.323 --> 38:47.194
I missed...

38:47.237 --> 38:50.110
We missed so many years,

38:50.153 --> 38:52.808
and I wish I could
get that back,

38:52.852 --> 38:55.158
that time.

38:55.202 --> 38:57.291
But we both know that...

38:57.335 --> 38:58.945
That isn't...

39:00.381 --> 39:02.340
We can't.

39:07.214 --> 39:09.347
- And cut!

39:13.481 --> 39:15.440
That was...

39:15.483 --> 39:17.267
amazing.

39:19.879 --> 39:22.882
Now do it again, 27 more times.

39:31.412 --> 39:33.588
- Hey, you set the bar high,
overachiever.

39:36.025 --> 39:38.376
Good job.

39:39.115 --> 39:40.856
- I don't think I can do this.

39:40.900 --> 39:43.337
- Clyde, listen to me,
you don't have to be perfect.

39:43.381 --> 39:45.252
Just talk to her.

39:45.295 --> 39:47.036
- Cut!

39:47.080 --> 39:48.473
- All right, that's a wrap!

39:48.516 --> 39:50.083
First day of "Technicolor
Highway" in the can!

39:50.126 --> 39:52.564
- All right.

39:52.607 --> 39:54.304
- Congratulations.

39:54.348 --> 39:55.871
- Thank you so much.
- You did great.

39:55.915 --> 39:57.482
- I have Adam from the studio.

39:57.525 --> 39:59.397
- Tell him we just wrapped
and I'll get back to him...

39:59.440 --> 40:01.355
- He says it's important.

40:01.399 --> 40:03.444
"The Kill Plan" test numbers
just came in.

40:08.057 --> 40:09.842
- Adam, hey.

40:09.885 --> 40:11.931
- So the news is not good.

40:11.974 --> 40:13.498
- Okay...

40:13.541 --> 40:15.195
- Amazing.
I'm so... be proud...

40:15.238 --> 40:16.588
- That's a good start.
- Thank you.

40:20.287 --> 40:22.158
- Strong first day.

40:23.551 --> 40:25.118
- Thank you.

40:28.251 --> 40:30.645
What's this?
- A gift.

40:37.130 --> 40:39.654
He lives in Lompoc,
couple hours north of here.

40:39.698 --> 40:42.614
He's a painter, lives alone.
Twice divorced.

40:42.657 --> 40:45.094
No kids.

40:45.138 --> 40:47.009
No other kids.

40:51.100 --> 40:53.189
Our work together's done,

40:53.233 --> 40:55.235
but now your real work begins.

41:00.588 --> 41:02.068
- I think it's great.
Thank you.

41:02.111 --> 41:03.504
- 'Kay.

41:06.464 --> 41:08.466
- You look quite pleased
with yourself.

41:11.077 --> 41:12.600
I'm starting to wonder

41:12.644 --> 41:15.037
if we didn't sell
ourselves short back then.

41:17.562 --> 41:19.389
What do we do for a living?

41:19.433 --> 41:20.565
We help people, right?

41:20.608 --> 41:23.481
We guide them
to do their best work,

41:23.524 --> 41:25.700
achieve their better selves.

41:25.744 --> 41:29.051
And I just think that...

41:29.095 --> 41:31.663
we would make amazing parents,

41:31.706 --> 41:34.535
and maybe it's time
to reopen that conversation.

41:48.593 --> 41:51.247
Uh, hi. Uh, is Mason there?

41:52.684 --> 41:55.077
Oh, hi, Wes.
I'm a friend of your mom's.

41:55.121 --> 41:57.079
I've been trying to get
a hold of her. Is she...

41:58.690 --> 42:00.300
What?

42:10.136 --> 42:11.572
When?

42:31.723 --> 42:33.289
- Hey.

42:38.077 --> 42:39.557
You did great today.

42:41.689 --> 42:43.517
- Back at ya.

42:48.087 --> 42:49.697
You okay?

42:54.136 --> 42:55.616
- Yeah.
