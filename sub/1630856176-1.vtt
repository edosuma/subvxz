31:35.719 --> 31:36.982
How do you know it's a he?

31:36.982 --> 31:38.853
It could be a she or a they or-

31:38.853 --> 31:40.376
- What the fuck
difference does it make?

31:40.376 --> 31:41.377
It just ate your friends!

31:41.377 --> 31:42.639
[Sarah sobs]

31:42.639 --> 31:44.119
[knocking at door]

31:44.119 --> 31:45.642
- Oh, fuck, fuck!
- Oh my God!

31:45.642 --> 31:47.209
[knocking at door]

31:47.209 --> 31:48.645
- It's ramming the door.
It's ramming the door.

31:48.645 --> 31:49.516
- Huh?

31:49.516 --> 31:52.214
[ominous music]

31:56.915 --> 31:59.918
[Hope sighs]

31:59.918 --> 32:00.831
Okay.

32:02.746 --> 32:05.401
See? I told you it can't get in.

32:05.401 --> 32:10.015
[group scream]
[foreboding music]

32:10.015 --> 32:10.929
The fuck?

32:12.278 --> 32:15.498
[alligator growls]

32:15.498 --> 32:17.761
Oh, shit. How did it
get up there so fast?

32:17.761 --> 32:19.546
- Oh my God.

32:19.546 --> 32:22.462
- You guys, it's on
the fucking roof.

32:22.462 --> 32:25.595
[alligator growls]

32:25.595 --> 32:28.555
[foreboding music]

32:33.821 --> 32:36.302
- Oh my God. It's leaving.

32:36.302 --> 32:37.825
- Thank God.

32:37.825 --> 32:40.132
- Yeah, for now. It
knows where to find us.

32:41.394 --> 32:42.482
- That scream.

32:43.744 --> 32:45.528
- What?

32:45.528 --> 32:49.141
- That scream you heard earlier,
it sounded like Paisley.

32:49.141 --> 32:50.272
- You think she
could still be alive?

32:50.272 --> 32:52.796
- I don't know. Maybe.

32:52.796 --> 32:55.277
You guys, she could
still be out there.

32:55.277 --> 32:57.323
- Yeah, as his
fucking bait, bro.

32:57.323 --> 32:58.498
- Don't say that!

32:58.498 --> 33:00.239
- Babe, enough of this shit.

33:01.283 --> 33:02.850
- Baby, where are you going?

33:02.850 --> 33:04.895
- We're getting the
fuck out of here!

33:06.114 --> 33:07.289
Fuck yeah!

33:07.289 --> 33:09.117
- [Hope] You cannot be serious.

33:09.117 --> 33:11.206
- Look, the only way
we're getting out of here

33:11.206 --> 33:12.207
is with the Jeep.

33:12.207 --> 33:14.122
I'm gonna go get it.

33:14.122 --> 33:16.211
I might even have to take this
thing out for my boy Pearce!

33:16.211 --> 33:17.299
- No, baby. It's too dangerous.

33:17.299 --> 33:19.214
You can't!

33:19.214 --> 33:21.042
- She's right, dude. It's
way too dangerous out there.

33:21.042 --> 33:23.001
I'm an alpha, bro!

33:25.612 --> 33:26.961
Yes!

33:26.961 --> 33:28.919
Okay, I'm gonna get the car

33:28.919 --> 33:31.400
and reverse as close
as I can to the door.

33:31.400 --> 33:33.315
You all pile in and we GTFO!

33:34.664 --> 33:36.797
On God, it's the only way.

33:38.233 --> 33:39.974
- You're so brave.

33:39.974 --> 33:41.236
- Or massively stupid.

33:41.236 --> 33:42.977
Seriously, Chad!
It's a bad idea!

33:42.977 --> 33:44.848
- I'm gonna get us out of here.

33:44.848 --> 33:47.155
I'll go see what else my
uncle has in his bedroom.

33:47.155 --> 33:48.417
He might even have a strap.

33:48.417 --> 33:49.810
- A strap-on?

33:50.854 --> 33:52.204
What are you gonna do, fuck it?

33:52.204 --> 33:55.033
- What? No, bro, a strap.

33:55.033 --> 33:57.252
A fucking gun.

33:57.252 --> 33:58.427
- Oh.

33:58.427 --> 33:59.994
- God.

33:59.994 --> 34:02.083
- Yeah, God, Hope. Can
you be serious for once?

34:02.083 --> 34:03.693
You're such an idiot!

34:04.868 --> 34:07.219
Baby, wait! Wait!

34:07.219 --> 34:08.872
Don't leave me with them!

34:09.830 --> 34:12.093
- [Chad] Fuck yeah!

34:12.093 --> 34:13.051
- You okay?

34:14.487 --> 34:15.618
- Not really.

34:16.924 --> 34:17.751
You?

34:17.751 --> 34:18.839
- No.

34:18.839 --> 34:20.014
- Yeah.

34:20.014 --> 34:21.624
- And this plan is dumb as shit.

34:21.624 --> 34:23.061
- You can say that again.

34:23.061 --> 34:24.758
- But I don't see any other way.

34:26.412 --> 34:29.937
- I mean, that gator,
it seemed different.

34:31.547 --> 34:34.463
Like, could that be even real?

34:34.463 --> 34:36.465
It looked different, right?

34:36.465 --> 34:39.990
Like it was from another
planet or something.

34:39.990 --> 34:43.211
Like, none of this
makes any sense.

34:43.211 --> 34:44.082
- I know.

34:45.822 --> 34:50.523
- By the way, when Chad was
talking about his strap,

34:51.915 --> 34:54.657
I had no idea what
he was talking about.

34:54.657 --> 34:55.571
- I did.

34:57.399 --> 34:59.009
- Of course you did.

35:00.576 --> 35:02.839
At least, if we do die tonight,

35:04.189 --> 35:06.582
we'll die having beaten
them in beer pong.

35:06.582 --> 35:07.583
- Good point.

35:07.583 --> 35:09.281
- Yeah.

35:09.281 --> 35:10.934
- Hey, it'll be all right.

35:11.979 --> 35:13.720
Chad has an idiot confidence.

35:15.200 --> 35:17.593
Things always go right
for people like that.

35:17.593 --> 35:19.204
- Yeah.

35:19.204 --> 35:20.118
- Let's go!

35:21.554 --> 35:23.947
Oh, shit, Hope. I always
thought you were gay.

35:24.992 --> 35:26.776
- Fuck off.

35:26.776 --> 35:28.126
- Not that there's
anything wrong with that.

35:28.126 --> 35:30.432
I'm actually an ally.

35:30.432 --> 35:32.173
- It's not even the same thing.

35:32.173 --> 35:33.783
- What?

35:33.783 --> 35:35.742
- Chad, are you sure
this is a good idea?

35:35.742 --> 35:37.831
I mean, maybe we can come
up with something better.

35:37.831 --> 35:40.355
- I was born for it.

35:40.355 --> 35:43.271
- I'm like fucking
SEAL Team Six, bro.

35:43.271 --> 35:44.446
[Chad imitates gunfire]

35:44.446 --> 35:47.449
[Chad chuckles]

35:47.449 --> 35:48.842
- So hot.

35:48.842 --> 35:50.713
- Thanks, babe.

35:50.713 --> 35:52.889
- Okay. Is there
anything we can do?

35:52.889 --> 35:53.803
- Nah.

35:55.283 --> 35:56.371
It's all me.

36:01.985 --> 36:03.291
The second I go out there-

36:03.291 --> 36:04.466
- Fuck.

36:04.466 --> 36:06.033
- You guys lock this door, okay?

36:06.033 --> 36:09.906
I'm gonna stay low and
make my way to the car.

36:09.906 --> 36:12.170
No matter what happens
to me out there,

36:12.170 --> 36:15.477
do not open the door until
I back the car up, okay?

36:15.477 --> 36:16.304
Okay, babe?

36:16.304 --> 36:17.827
Okay? Okay?

36:17.827 --> 36:19.351
- Okay.
- Yeah, yeah.

36:19.351 --> 36:20.482
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.

36:20.482 --> 36:21.788
[Sarah indistinctly stammers]

36:21.788 --> 36:23.746
- Babe, I have no fear.

36:25.966 --> 36:26.880
Zero.

36:28.273 --> 36:30.318
I need you to stay
strong for me.

36:30.318 --> 36:31.928
- Okay.

36:31.928 --> 36:34.453
- I got this, babe.
You know it, right?

36:34.453 --> 36:36.324
- Okay.

36:36.324 --> 36:39.849
- I'm just built
different, babe.

[dramatic music]

36:43.636 --> 36:44.506
Mwah!

36:45.377 --> 36:46.247
Woo.

36:47.944 --> 36:49.468
Oh, yeah. No fear.

36:51.513 --> 36:52.862
No fucking fear.

36:54.342 --> 36:56.736
Fear is weakness.
Pain is weakness.

37:00.087 --> 37:01.088
- Good luck, man.

37:03.177 --> 37:05.440
- You may be an idiot,
but you are brave.

37:05.440 --> 37:10.402
- Guys, it's nothing. This
thing ain't got shit on me.

37:10.402 --> 37:11.533
Let's go! Oh!

37:12.795 --> 37:14.928
- Go get 'em, babe!
- Woo!

[ominous music]

37:17.670 --> 37:19.019

[crickets chirping]

37:22.196 --> 37:23.110
Oh, fuck.

37:24.459 --> 37:26.200
Fuck, fuck.
- He's panicking.

37:26.200 --> 37:27.723
I can't.
- He's totally fine.

37:27.723 --> 37:29.029
Shut up.
- I can't fucking do this.

37:29.029 --> 37:30.465
- Go get 'em, baby!
- Woo!

37:30.465 --> 37:33.642
[group cheers over each other]

37:33.642 --> 37:34.904
- You're good, pal.

37:34.904 --> 37:36.166
- That's good.

37:37.603 --> 37:39.257
Fuck.

37:39.257 --> 37:41.955
- He can do it. He's
totally gonna get it.

37:41.955 --> 37:43.565
Move.

37:45.611 --> 37:48.091
- [Sam] Okay. Here he
goes, here he goes.

37:48.091 --> 37:49.092
- [Hope] Okay.

37:49.092 --> 37:50.093
- Stay low! Stay low!

37:50.093 --> 37:51.312
- You got it. Stay low.

37:51.312 --> 37:52.922
- [Sam] Come on, buddy.

37:52.922 --> 37:54.489
- [Hope] Why is he
walking like that?

37:54.489 --> 37:56.970
- [Sarah] It's an
athletic stance.

37:58.188 --> 37:59.755
- Yay!
- Go get it, baby!

37:59.755 --> 38:01.017
- Woo!

Do something!

Come on!

38:19.645 --> 38:20.472

38:31.483 --> 38:33.006

38:33.006 --> 38:34.747
- He's close.

38:34.747 --> 38:36.705
- Okay, okay, I got you.

38:36.705 --> 38:38.098
I'm gonna get us out of here,
okay? It's gonna be all good.

38:48.804 --> 38:49.892

[solemn music]

40:30.166 --> 40:31.690
- He was so sweet.

40:33.648 --> 40:34.519
Why?

40:35.781 --> 40:38.174
Why is this happening to me?

40:41.787 --> 40:44.659
We were gonna get
married someday.

40:47.793 --> 40:48.750
- Uh, yeah.

40:51.318 --> 40:53.886
I'm really sorry, Sarah.

40:53.886 --> 40:55.757
- Yeah.

40:55.757 --> 40:57.846
Yeah.

40:57.846 --> 40:59.718
What the fuck are we gonna do?

40:59.718 --> 41:01.546
- I don't know. That thing
didn't even look real.

41:01.546 --> 41:02.460
- Well, it is. You saw
what it just did to Chad.

41:02.460 --> 41:04.897
[Sarah sobs]

41:04.897 --> 41:06.028
Sorry, Sarah.

41:08.422 --> 41:10.250
How the fuck are we
gonna get outta here?

41:10.250 --> 41:11.077
- I don't know.

41:11.077 --> 41:12.295
- Sam!

41:12.295 --> 41:13.383
- I'm thinking. I'm thinking.

41:15.821 --> 41:18.301
What if we, like, distracted
it with our food or something?

41:18.301 --> 41:20.129
- Do you think that
thing's gonna want

41:20.129 --> 41:22.262
Gwyneth Paltrow's vegan
tahini dip and some olives?

41:22.262 --> 41:23.481
- Yeah. Maybe.

41:25.134 --> 41:26.396
- Still alive.

41:29.399 --> 41:31.097
- What was that, Sarah?

41:32.794 --> 41:35.841
- Do you think he could
still be alive, like Paisley?

41:36.624 --> 41:37.495
- Who?

41:38.278 --> 41:39.192
- Chad!

41:40.149 --> 41:40.976
- Um.

41:40.976 --> 41:42.064
- Uh.

41:42.064 --> 41:43.457
- Maybe.

41:43.457 --> 41:45.720
- [Hope and Sam] Yeah, yeah.

41:45.720 --> 41:46.895
- Probably.

41:46.895 --> 41:47.940
- [Hope] It's looking good.

41:47.940 --> 41:49.245
- Mhm.

41:49.245 --> 41:52.292
There's a big chance.

41:52.292 --> 41:53.336
Yeah.

41:53.336 --> 41:54.903

42:01.736 --> 42:03.521
- Oh my God!

42:03.521 --> 42:04.478
- Holy fuck. I completely
forgot about her.

[tense music]
[alligator growls]

42:08.003 --> 42:10.397

Get off me!
[Paisley screams]

42:13.400 --> 42:14.575

[ominous music]

42:21.713 --> 42:23.018

42:33.333 --> 42:35.117
[Sam sighs]

42:35.117 --> 42:36.249
- Oh, no, no.

42:39.426 --> 42:41.602
Wait, look, look,
look. Look, over there.

42:41.602 --> 42:43.082

42:43.082 --> 42:44.257
[Sarah whimpers]

42:44.257 --> 42:45.258
- By the basketball hoop.

42:45.258 --> 42:46.825

42:46.825 --> 42:51.612
[Sarah panting]

43:05.713 --> 43:06.888
- Oh, God. Oh, God.

43:06.888 --> 43:08.934
It's gonna fucking eat her!

43:08.934 --> 43:11.589
- Okay. We need to distract it.

43:13.286 --> 43:15.375
- It's been kind of
nice, just the two of us.

43:15.375 --> 43:18.334
I mean, what do we do?

43:18.334 --> 43:19.901
- The food. The food.

43:19.901 --> 43:22.295
We can distract
it with the food.

43:22.295 --> 43:23.818
The, the, the-

43:23.818 --> 43:25.341
- The dip, the dip!
- The dip shit

43:25.341 --> 43:27.082
that she likes to
eat, that disgusting

43:27.082 --> 43:28.214
Gwyneth Paltrow.
- Get it, get it, get it!

43:28.214 --> 43:30.129
- [Hope] LA shit she likes.

43:30.129 --> 43:31.739
Where the hell would you
keep something like that?

43:31.739 --> 43:32.914
Oh, the fridge!

43:32.914 --> 43:34.263
- Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up!

43:35.830 --> 43:37.223
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.

43:37.223 --> 43:38.398

43:38.398 --> 43:39.094
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

43:39.094 --> 43:40.313
- What?

43:40.313 --> 43:41.531
- Are you sure?

43:41.531 --> 43:43.403
- Yes. We have to try something.

43:43.403 --> 43:44.404
Okay?

43:44.404 --> 43:45.405
- Okay, okay, okay.

43:45.405 --> 43:46.101
- Don't be a baby.

43:46.101 --> 43:47.407
Okay.

like tahini dip.

- Okay!

44:49.425 --> 44:52.428
[suspenseful music]

44:54.474 --> 44:56.563
- I think I insulted
it with the dip.

44:56.563 --> 44:57.651
- Oh my God.

45:01.873 --> 45:03.483
Oh my God. The keys.

Please don't kill me, Mr. Gator.

I promise I'll return
my gator handbag.

[Sarah gasping]

45:20.543 --> 45:21.806
Okay, Sarah.

45:21.806 --> 45:24.634
You can do this.
You can do this.

Help me move the couch.

45:50.704 --> 45:52.358
- Okay. Okay. Okay.

- Okay.

[Sam grunts]

45:55.665 --> 45:56.492
You got it?

45:56.492 --> 45:58.407
- [Hope] Yeah.

45:58.407 --> 46:00.627
- Okay, okay. Now pull it.

46:05.371 --> 46:06.372
Okay. Okay.

46:14.554 --> 46:16.469
Is it bizarrely quiet?

46:19.254 --> 46:22.214
- Why isn't it trying to get in?

46:22.214 --> 46:23.998
- Maybe the dip killed it.

46:23.998 --> 46:26.740
- I can't fucking believe
this is happening.

46:26.740 --> 46:28.742
- Better them than us, right?

46:28.742 --> 46:30.048
- Yeah.

46:30.048 --> 46:31.527
- Right?

46:31.527 --> 46:32.354
- Are you kidding me?

46:32.354 --> 46:33.225
- Shit, shit.

46:40.928 --> 46:45.933
[ominous music]
[alligator growls]

46:47.413 --> 46:50.938
- I didn't even wanna
fucking be here, okay?

46:50.938 --> 46:52.548
My mom guilt tripped
me into coming

46:52.548 --> 46:54.463
so I could get to
know Chad better.

46:55.900 --> 46:57.945
Why did I listen?
I could be home.

46:59.338 --> 47:02.123
Instead, I am in the
fucking redneck riviera,

47:02.123 --> 47:04.604
hiding from a man-eating gator!

47:04.604 --> 47:07.346
- I didn't even want
to be here either.

47:07.346 --> 47:08.956
- At least they're your friends.

47:10.218 --> 47:11.089
Well, they were.

47:12.438 --> 47:13.743
- I mean, not really.

47:15.049 --> 47:16.921
Those guys are fucking assholes.

47:16.921 --> 47:20.359
I don't even like them, and
they sound dumb as shit.

47:20.359 --> 47:21.926
- So why did you come?

47:23.188 --> 47:24.058
- I, uh...

47:25.930 --> 47:27.192
I heard you were coming.

47:29.759 --> 47:31.544
- But you didn't even know me.

47:33.024 --> 47:35.765
- Chad kinda showed
me a picture of you,

47:35.765 --> 47:39.334
and I may have stalked
your Instagram.

47:40.683 --> 47:41.597
- You did?

47:42.555 --> 47:43.469
- Yeah.

47:45.297 --> 47:47.125
I don't even know why I'm
admitting this right now.

47:47.125 --> 47:49.605
It's probably 'cause we're both
gonna die tonight, but yeah.

47:52.913 --> 47:54.175
- That's kind of creepy.

47:56.743 --> 47:58.049
- Sorry.

47:58.049 --> 47:59.180
- But cute.

Hey. Wake up.

49:53.251 --> 49:54.252
- What, what, what, what, what?

49:54.252 --> 49:55.557
- We fell asleep.

49:56.776 --> 49:57.864
- Shit.

49:57.864 --> 49:59.431
- [Sam] Yeah.

49:59.431 --> 50:00.910
- I was hoping this was
all just a nightmare.

50:00.910 --> 50:03.174
- Yeah, me too.

50:03.174 --> 50:06.742
- How long were we out?

50:06.742 --> 50:08.440
- A few hours or so.

50:10.485 --> 50:13.271
- Do you think it's
still out there?

50:13.271 --> 50:16.883
I mean, maybe it gave
up and it went away.

50:16.883 --> 50:17.797
- Maybe.

50:19.538 --> 50:22.236
[playful music]

50:28.590 --> 50:31.071
- Oh. I'll go check.

50:31.071 --> 50:32.029
- Yeah. Thank you.

50:34.335 --> 50:37.295
[foreboding music]

50:39.166 --> 50:40.733
- Okay.

50:40.733 --> 50:41.647
It's fine.

50:42.735 --> 50:45.303
[tense music]
[Sam gasps]

50:45.303 --> 50:46.217
- What?

50:46.217 --> 50:48.001
[Sam screams]

50:48.001 --> 50:49.568
- [Sam] Holy shit!

50:52.049 --> 50:53.920
- So?

50:53.920 --> 50:54.703
- Yeah, so it was just
right outside the window,

50:54.703 --> 50:55.574
waiting for us.

50:55.574 --> 50:56.444
- Fuck!

50:56.444 --> 50:57.619
- [Sam] Yeah.

50:57.619 --> 50:59.186
- And Sarah, I mean, is she-

50:59.186 --> 51:01.232
- Dead, arm severed,
keys in her hand.

51:01.232 --> 51:02.537
I think we're fucked.

51:02.537 --> 51:04.452
- Well, what is it doing?

51:04.452 --> 51:06.019
- Oh, you know, it's like
regular alligator stuff,

51:06.019 --> 51:07.586
just floating through the air,

51:07.586 --> 51:09.109
circling the corpse
of our best friend.

51:09.109 --> 51:10.632
- Did you see anyone
else out there?

51:10.632 --> 51:13.287
- No, no. I'm pretty
sure it ate them all.

51:13.287 --> 51:14.114
- Fuck!

51:14.114 --> 51:19.163
- Yeah.

51:19.859 --> 51:20.512
- The keys.

51:20.512 --> 51:22.427
- What?

51:22.427 --> 51:24.516
- The keys. You said the keys
are still in Sarah's hand.

51:24.516 --> 51:26.474
- Yeah. Her bloody,
disgusting, severed hand.

51:26.474 --> 51:29.477
- Okay, okay, so then
what if we distract it?

51:29.477 --> 51:30.957
- We give it her other hand!

51:30.957 --> 51:31.871
- No.

51:33.568 --> 51:35.440
We lead it outside and
then we make a break for it

51:35.440 --> 51:37.442
and we grab the keys and we
just get the fuck out of here.

51:37.442 --> 51:38.965
- No, no, no, no,
no. That didn't work.

51:38.965 --> 51:40.488
We already tried that.

51:40.488 --> 51:42.099
Remember, with the
vegan Goop tahini dip?

51:42.099 --> 51:43.230
He doesn't want that.
He's too smart for it.

51:43.230 --> 51:45.102
He wants us. He wants meat.

51:45.102 --> 51:46.668
- Okay, well, we have
to try something,

51:46.668 --> 51:48.714
or else we're gonna
end up like them.

51:48.714 --> 51:50.933
- I like my hands.
