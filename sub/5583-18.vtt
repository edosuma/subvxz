00:02.603 --> 00:04.638
Previously on Empire...
Looks like Bunkie been
real tight with Shyne Johnson.

00:04.672 --> 00:07.041
Them four dealers you
killed back in the day?

00:07.075 --> 00:08.242
You is a murderer.

00:08.276 --> 00:09.710
(grunting)

00:09.743 --> 00:10.644
Will you marry me?

00:10.678 --> 00:11.979
Yes.
(crowd cheering)

00:12.012 --> 00:13.747
ANIKA: You think
that someone pushed you?

00:13.781 --> 00:15.349
RHONDA:
I don't know.

00:17.385 --> 00:20.588
Look, I know you a Fed, Tariq,
so you better not be planning on

00:20.621 --> 00:22.156
putting the squeeze on my sister

00:22.190 --> 00:24.425
to try to come for me
or my family.

00:24.458 --> 00:25.759
MAN: Gun!
No, no, no! Stop, Freda! No!

00:25.793 --> 00:28.229
(gunshot, people screaming)
Jamal!

00:28.262 --> 00:29.597
Mr. and Mrs. Lyon?

00:33.067 --> 00:34.502
(piano playing gentle melody)

00:34.535 --> 00:37.738
VERONICA:
* You say you're right

00:37.771 --> 00:41.008
* I'll say you're wrong

00:41.041 --> 00:42.943
* You'll be polite...

00:42.976 --> 00:44.044
Hey!

00:44.078 --> 00:46.880
* But continue on...

00:46.914 --> 00:48.216
HAKEEM:
You look like

00:48.249 --> 00:49.350
you lost some weight, man.

00:49.383 --> 00:51.119
How you doing, man?
You good, brother?

00:51.152 --> 00:53.020
Miss you, man.

00:53.053 --> 00:55.223
We're so glad you're back!
It's been so long.

00:55.256 --> 00:58.426
* Ooh...

01:00.928 --> 01:03.864
* You say it's night

01:03.897 --> 01:07.201
* And I'll say it's morning

01:07.235 --> 01:10.070
* You'll see the light

01:10.104 --> 01:13.741
* And pretend you don't

01:13.774 --> 01:16.777
* And I'll close the blinds

01:16.810 --> 01:21.081
* If you really want me to

01:21.115 --> 01:26.454
* If that's what
you want to do *

01:26.487 --> 01:29.990
* But life has its own

01:30.023 --> 01:32.960
* Arranges

01:32.993 --> 01:36.630
* As time passes on

01:36.664 --> 01:39.567
* And changes

01:39.600 --> 01:44.772
* The hourglass
moves on a grain *

01:46.707 --> 01:51.745
* And our path is torn
and strained. *

01:51.779 --> 01:53.080
You better sing, girl!

01:53.113 --> 01:55.015
HAKEEM: Yeah, V.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:55.048 --> 01:56.284
Something like that.

01:56.317 --> 01:57.918
What do you think?
It's hot, right?

01:57.951 --> 01:59.787
Think it'll be great for
your brother's wedding.

02:01.622 --> 02:03.191
Yeah, I want you and V
to sing it together.

02:03.224 --> 02:05.193
It's dope, right?

02:05.226 --> 02:07.195
It's beautiful, Veronica.

02:07.228 --> 02:08.429
Thanks, Jamal.

02:08.462 --> 02:10.264
Told you.
(laughs)

02:10.298 --> 02:12.099
Y'all got to find somebody else
to sing it with you though,

02:12.132 --> 02:13.167
'cause I'm not gonna perform.

02:13.201 --> 02:14.635
COOKIE:
No. Yes, you are, Jamal.

02:14.668 --> 02:16.337
You just saying that 'cause
you're tired right now.

02:16.370 --> 02:18.772
Look, your father turned his
gym into a rehab just for you.

02:18.806 --> 02:20.107
No, what I actually did,

02:20.140 --> 02:21.775
I got the top
physical therapist,

02:21.809 --> 02:24.144
the same dude that put
Peyton Manning together

02:24.178 --> 02:26.046
after that big old
neck injury of his.

02:26.079 --> 02:27.181
He said he's gonna have you

02:27.215 --> 02:28.682
in tip-top shape
in a couple weeks, son.

02:28.716 --> 02:29.950
COOKIE:
See?

02:29.983 --> 02:32.119
Look, we... we want you
to sing at our wedding.

02:32.152 --> 02:33.487
Yes, we would love that.

02:34.922 --> 02:36.624
Look, Dre even got ordained
so he can do the ceremony.

02:36.657 --> 02:38.326
(laughs)

02:38.359 --> 02:40.694
HAKEEM:
He gonna marry us, Mal.

02:40.728 --> 02:43.297
So I want both of my
brothers to be there.

02:43.331 --> 02:45.233
Period.

02:45.266 --> 02:48.469
Maybe we should leave him alone,
let him get some rest.

02:48.502 --> 02:50.838
Look, we can even postpone
it if you're not feeling...

02:50.871 --> 02:52.172
I ain't singing no more,
all right?

02:56.377 --> 02:58.346
I'm sorry, man.
I'm just... I'm just tired.

03:00.113 --> 03:02.683
(voice breaking):
Ain't y'all tired?

03:04.518 --> 03:06.854
The same damn cycle
all the time.

03:09.423 --> 03:11.425
Just death and incarceration.

03:14.595 --> 03:16.564
We could change that cycle.

03:20.368 --> 03:22.836
I ain't singing again
until we do.

03:22.870 --> 03:24.905
Come on, man.
What are you talking about?

03:24.938 --> 03:27.074
Don't you realize if
it hadn't been for you,

03:27.107 --> 03:28.876
I might not even
be here, man.

03:28.909 --> 03:30.544
You ain't got to thank me
for that, Dad.

03:30.578 --> 03:33.347
No, no. I mean... I mean,
you took a bullet for me, baby.

03:33.381 --> 03:34.882
That's something
I will never forget.

03:34.915 --> 03:36.884
How's Freda?

03:36.917 --> 03:39.052
(laughs)

03:39.086 --> 03:41.221
You mean the girl that
tried to shoot me?

03:41.255 --> 03:43.924
She's a victim in this.
She is. She's a victim, too.

03:43.957 --> 03:46.294
Just like him and me and him.

03:46.327 --> 03:48.228
Jamal.
LEAH:
Dwight,

03:48.262 --> 03:49.630
you and them kids

03:49.663 --> 03:52.566
is paying for the crimes
of your daddy.

03:56.570 --> 03:58.306
Dwight, Dwight,
hide over here. Here.

03:58.972 --> 04:00.641
Shh.

04:06.113 --> 04:07.481
(grunting)

04:09.850 --> 04:11.619
What are you talking about,
Grandma?
COOKIE: Okay.

04:11.652 --> 04:13.654
Jamal is grumpy
because he's tired.

04:13.687 --> 04:15.389
He ain't never been
shot before.

04:15.423 --> 04:17.925
(chuckles)
So I'm gonna take him
to his room.

04:17.958 --> 04:19.793
You said our
grandfather was a cop.

04:19.827 --> 04:22.596
My daddy was a cop.

04:25.599 --> 04:27.735
Okay.

04:27.768 --> 04:30.137
It's time for you
to take your nap.

04:30.170 --> 04:32.673
Juanita's gonna bring you up
a nice little brandy.

04:32.706 --> 04:34.241
Come on.

04:34.274 --> 04:36.410
Say good-bye
to everybody.

04:36.444 --> 04:37.811
Good-bye to everybody.

04:37.845 --> 04:40.614
LUCIOUS: You're lucky
Thirsty caught you

04:40.648 --> 04:42.650
before you blabbed
to all those reporters.

04:42.683 --> 04:44.752
You keep
squeezing my arm,

04:44.785 --> 04:47.621
and I'm gonna check your
damn mouth with my foot.

04:47.655 --> 04:49.357
(quietly):
Look, this is my house.

04:49.390 --> 04:52.426
I'm the only one that talks
to my children about my past.

04:52.460 --> 04:53.461
Is that clear?

04:53.494 --> 04:55.963
Tell them the truth.

04:57.998 --> 04:59.500
Juanita!

05:00.834 --> 05:02.836
*

05:07.841 --> 05:09.009
I'm worried about him.

05:09.042 --> 05:10.511
I mean, and
it's not because

05:10.544 --> 05:12.680
he doesn't want to
do physical therapy.

05:12.713 --> 05:14.782
He seems off, Lucious.
Yeah.

05:14.815 --> 05:18.285
Doctors said
he should be walking, but, um...

05:18.318 --> 05:19.853
he don't want to do music.

05:19.887 --> 05:21.889
Yeah, that's what concerns me.

05:21.922 --> 05:23.624
(knocking on door)
Come in.

05:23.657 --> 05:26.126
I got Ms. Calhoun for you.

05:26.159 --> 05:27.695
Hey.

05:27.728 --> 05:29.296
How's my grandbaby?

05:29.329 --> 05:31.131
He's a little stressed out
right now, to be honest.

05:31.164 --> 05:33.300
Do you have a moment where I
can speak with you privately?

05:33.333 --> 05:34.735
(laughs)

05:34.768 --> 05:36.404
Cookie and me
ain't got no secrets.

05:36.437 --> 05:37.538
Girl, sit down.

05:43.377 --> 05:45.379
I was picked up
by a couple of federal agents

05:45.413 --> 05:46.414
the other day.

05:46.447 --> 05:49.182
Tariq. I told your ass.

05:49.216 --> 05:51.318
After they told me what
they might have wanted from me,

05:51.351 --> 05:52.886
I absolutely demanded
to be allowed to leave.

05:52.920 --> 05:54.488
THIRSTY:
Yeah, but now, of course,

05:54.522 --> 05:56.390
they're gonna try to subpoena
her. Can't let that happen.

05:56.424 --> 05:58.158
We're gonna get
24-hour security around you.

05:58.191 --> 05:59.660
COOKIE:
Okay, what did they say?

05:59.693 --> 06:01.361
What kind of questions
did they ask you?

06:01.395 --> 06:02.563
They were asking a lot.

06:02.596 --> 06:03.664
I didn't answer any of them.

06:03.697 --> 06:05.165
Girl, you remember something.

06:05.198 --> 06:06.500
They said something about

06:06.534 --> 06:09.236
a guy named
Shyne Johnson, Shyne?

06:09.269 --> 06:10.337
Shyne Johnson?

06:10.370 --> 06:11.705
I knew I heard your voice,
you evil bitch!

06:11.739 --> 06:12.706
(screams)

06:12.740 --> 06:14.207
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
(all shouting)

06:19.447 --> 06:20.514
(screams) Oh, my God!

06:20.548 --> 06:22.349
I got her. I got you.
I got you.

06:22.382 --> 06:23.784
Come on, come on.
Get off of me, Dre!

06:23.817 --> 06:25.686
It's okay, let me see.
Oh, my God.

06:25.719 --> 06:27.521
What in the hell
is wrong with you?!

06:27.555 --> 06:29.523
I know you pushed me, bitch!
What?!

06:29.557 --> 06:31.258
RHONDA:
Get off of me! Ow!

06:31.291 --> 06:33.060
Calm down.
Get off of me!

06:33.093 --> 06:35.028
No, that's a wild accusation
to make!

06:35.062 --> 06:36.530
I passed out on the way down,

06:36.564 --> 06:38.699
and then I woke up
and I saw your shoes.

06:38.732 --> 06:39.867
The bottom of those

06:39.900 --> 06:41.268
red Louboutins you love so much.

06:41.301 --> 06:42.803
Oh, my God, she's crazy!
LUCIOUS: Wait, no, no ,no.

06:42.836 --> 06:44.772
Rhonda, a whole lot of women
rock them shoes.

06:44.805 --> 06:45.773
I got a pair.

06:45.806 --> 06:47.207
LUCIOUS: Rhonda...
You're on her side now?

06:47.240 --> 06:48.809
I'm on nobody's side,
but I'm saying

06:48.842 --> 06:50.444
I can't see her doing that.

06:50.478 --> 06:51.712
Okay, wait a minute.

06:51.745 --> 06:52.946
Hold up. So, Rhonda,

06:52.980 --> 06:55.816
you really think
pearl-clutching debutante Anika

06:55.849 --> 06:57.317
pushed you down the steps?

06:57.350 --> 06:58.486
I know you did it.

06:58.519 --> 07:00.287
How could I do something
like that to you, Rhonda?

07:00.320 --> 07:01.622
Oh, shut up, bitch!

07:01.655 --> 07:02.590
Tell 'em, Dre.

07:02.623 --> 07:04.592
(sighs) Tell 'em.

07:04.625 --> 07:06.259
Dre?

07:08.261 --> 07:09.396
We're sorry.

07:09.429 --> 07:10.397
Wow.

07:10.430 --> 07:11.799
We are sorry, Pop.
Sorry?

07:11.832 --> 07:13.133
I don't know what's
going on here.

07:13.166 --> 07:15.068
We didn't mean to come
into your office...

07:15.102 --> 07:16.103
We're sorry?

07:16.136 --> 07:18.305
...like this, with
this type of energy.

07:18.338 --> 07:19.406
(laughs)
We're very sorry.

07:19.439 --> 07:20.440
You are pathetic!

07:20.474 --> 07:22.309
Sorry about that.
Is she okay?

07:22.342 --> 07:23.611
Yeah, it's okay.

07:23.644 --> 07:25.245
Oh, my God,
she is crazy!

07:25.278 --> 07:27.648
I could never do
something like that!

07:27.681 --> 07:28.782
Okay, go clean her up.
Calm her down.

07:28.816 --> 07:29.817
I got you. I got you.

07:29.850 --> 07:30.951
Before she lose the baby.

07:30.984 --> 07:32.786
Hey, and stay with her
till we get her

07:32.820 --> 07:34.087
some security.
I'm on it.

07:34.121 --> 07:35.155
She won't be subpoenaed.

07:35.188 --> 07:36.590
Now that I'm not
carrying his grandchild,

07:36.624 --> 07:38.125
we are nothing
to him again.

07:38.158 --> 07:40.127
And he's gonna let
her get away with it.

07:40.160 --> 07:41.128
They don't believe it, Rhonda.

07:41.161 --> 07:42.462
What?

07:42.496 --> 07:43.697
They don't believe it.

07:43.731 --> 07:45.432
And neither do I.

07:45.465 --> 07:47.434
What?

07:47.467 --> 07:48.836
What about your visions, huh?

07:48.869 --> 07:50.337
It's part of my illness, baby.

07:50.370 --> 07:51.438
You said so yourself.

07:51.471 --> 07:52.773
Well, if God was telling you

07:52.806 --> 07:54.207
that somebody pushed me
down the stairs,

07:54.241 --> 07:56.677
I might have to start
actually believing in him.

07:56.710 --> 07:59.446
Well, what do you want us to do?

07:59.479 --> 08:02.950
What I did for you.

08:02.983 --> 08:04.317
With Vernon.

08:05.986 --> 08:07.988
I didn't hesitate.

08:08.021 --> 08:09.957
It was self-defense, Rhonda.

08:09.990 --> 08:11.291
Oh, God.
It was self-defense.

08:11.324 --> 08:12.492
Come on.

08:12.526 --> 08:14.528
You know, your brothers
are both musicians, right?

08:14.562 --> 08:15.863
They got that from Lucious.

08:15.896 --> 08:16.964
But what you got,

08:16.997 --> 08:18.699
aside from his
mother's illness,

08:18.732 --> 08:21.969
is his killer instinct.

08:22.002 --> 08:22.870
JUANITA:
Mr. Andre?

08:23.937 --> 08:25.639
(clears throat)

08:25.673 --> 08:26.774
Thank you, Juanita.

08:28.341 --> 08:30.477
(sighs)

08:30.510 --> 08:31.545
(sniffles)

08:31.579 --> 08:33.547
You don't mean that.
Oh, I do.

08:33.581 --> 08:36.216
I definitely mean it.

08:36.249 --> 08:38.552
So, when you become the man
that I married,

08:38.586 --> 08:40.487
the man who's willing to do
what needs to be done...

08:40.520 --> 08:41.755
Mm.
...have him give me a call

08:41.789 --> 08:42.990
'cause I really
miss him.

08:43.023 --> 08:43.991
(chuckles):
Okay.

08:44.024 --> 08:45.525
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, laugh all you want.

08:46.894 --> 08:49.997
I told your ass
Tariq was gonna be a problem.

08:50.030 --> 08:53.834
Nah, he ain't the problem.

08:53.867 --> 08:55.869
We got too many people
in common.

08:57.905 --> 08:59.907
Problem is...

09:02.610 --> 09:03.877
What?

09:05.913 --> 09:08.548
(opera music playing,
volume grows louder)

09:08.582 --> 09:10.584
Ugh.
(clicks tongue)

09:18.626 --> 09:21.061
What is it, Lucious?

09:23.063 --> 09:25.532
You know, after
you got locked up,

09:25.565 --> 09:27.935
I had to put in work
on a couple cats.
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

09:27.968 --> 09:29.202
Drug dealers.

09:29.236 --> 09:30.904
The three horsemen
who wanted us dead.

09:30.938 --> 09:32.039
I got it.

09:32.072 --> 09:33.741
Yeah, well, there was
a fourth horseman.

09:33.774 --> 09:38.145
First three was to
protect our family.

09:38.178 --> 09:40.247
But that last one,
that was a job.

09:40.280 --> 09:41.749
(sighs)

09:41.782 --> 09:43.150
Who were you working for,
Lucious?

09:43.183 --> 09:44.718
You know who I
was working for.

09:44.752 --> 09:46.920
You was the one that
let them hear my music.

09:46.954 --> 09:50.390
Tommy Davoni and Rosey Perkins?

09:50.423 --> 09:51.892
Exactly.

09:51.925 --> 09:54.127
They were cutting a record
with this new artist

09:54.161 --> 09:56.830
that turned out to be
a real loudmouth.

09:56.864 --> 09:57.965
Selling wolf tickets,

09:57.998 --> 09:59.299
threatening all
the other artists,

09:59.332 --> 10:01.635
and so they wanted
him handled.

10:01.669 --> 10:04.972
And Shyne and me
got the memo.

10:05.005 --> 10:08.441
You do realize the Feds
aren't gonna let this go, right?

10:08.475 --> 10:10.310
(sighs)

10:10.343 --> 10:11.645
Who else knows?

10:11.679 --> 10:13.647
You, me and
Tommy and Rosey.

10:13.681 --> 10:14.648
(clicks tongue, sighs)

10:14.682 --> 10:15.916
But the both of them,

10:15.949 --> 10:17.851
they coming to Hakeem's
wedding, you know.

10:17.885 --> 10:19.653
We still tight.

10:19.687 --> 10:21.655
And they're legit now, so
they got just as much to lose.

10:21.689 --> 10:25.292
Right, right. And that's why
the Feds are all over Shyne.

10:25.325 --> 10:28.929
Yeah, but Shyne-- he's
a idiot thug, you know.

10:28.962 --> 10:30.330
He ain't no snitch.

10:30.363 --> 10:32.532
Know our past
got to stay buried.

10:32.565 --> 10:33.701
Mm-hmm.

10:33.734 --> 10:35.468
No one can know about this.

10:45.045 --> 10:47.047
* I got broads in Atlanta

10:47.080 --> 10:48.782
* Twistin' dope, lean,
and the Fanta *

10:48.816 --> 10:50.383
* Credit cards

10:50.417 --> 10:51.985
* Hittin' off licks
in the bando *

10:52.019 --> 10:53.020
* Black X6, Phantom...

10:53.053 --> 10:55.155
Is this Shyne's spot?

10:55.188 --> 10:56.990
* Going out like I'm Montana

10:57.024 --> 10:58.658
* Hundred killers,
hundred hammers *

10:58.692 --> 11:00.293
* Black X6, Phantom

11:00.327 --> 11:01.995
* White X6, Panda...

11:02.029 --> 11:03.731
SHYNE: How long's it take
to go around the corner

11:03.764 --> 11:05.132
and get some Twizzlers?

11:05.165 --> 11:08.702
I sent him out 30 minutes ago,
and he still ain't back.

11:10.537 --> 11:12.039
If he not here in
the next minute,

11:12.072 --> 11:13.807
I'm gonna put his
ass in a box, too.

11:13.841 --> 11:15.542
Told him to go
get Twizzlers,

11:15.575 --> 11:16.643
not the damn Holy Grail!

11:16.676 --> 11:17.677
(laughs)

11:17.711 --> 11:18.812
Hey, Shyne.

11:18.846 --> 11:20.180
That better be my Twizzlers.

11:20.213 --> 11:22.515
You expecting Cookie Lyon?
She on her way up.

11:23.550 --> 11:25.152
She late.

11:25.185 --> 11:27.020
* Black X6, Phantom

11:27.054 --> 11:28.321
* White X6, Panda

11:28.355 --> 11:30.223
* Pocket swole, Danny

11:30.257 --> 11:31.424

11:31.458 --> 11:33.193
* Man, I'm the macho

11:37.597 --> 11:39.432

11:39.466 --> 11:41.268
Let her in.

11:43.570 --> 11:45.538
* Panda.

11:45.572 --> 11:48.175
(sighs) Look.

11:48.208 --> 11:50.911
All I'm saying is
if one of y'all goes down,

11:50.944 --> 11:52.846
all of y'all go down.

11:52.880 --> 11:55.282
So don't you think it'd be smart
if y'all had each other's backs?

11:55.315 --> 11:57.951
Lucious cut me out.

11:57.985 --> 11:59.552
He owe me profits on his record.

11:59.586 --> 12:00.687
(scoffs)

12:00.720 --> 12:02.289
Shyne, you know
damn well

12:02.322 --> 12:03.857
you ain't have nothing
to do with that record.

12:03.891 --> 12:05.358
(sighs)

12:05.392 --> 12:06.593
Okay, look.

12:06.626 --> 12:08.695
How much is it gonna take
to make this right?

12:08.728 --> 12:10.530
I don't want his money.

12:10.563 --> 12:12.032
Well, what do you want, Shyne?

12:12.065 --> 12:14.234
I want a publishing deal
for my nephew Joey.

12:14.267 --> 12:16.536
This kid hella talented.

12:16.569 --> 12:18.038
He can't catch a break out here.

12:18.071 --> 12:19.940
Mm, sorry to hear that.

12:19.973 --> 12:21.474
Sorry...
Check this out.

12:21.508 --> 12:24.878

12:34.021 --> 12:36.089
Here, Shyne.

12:36.123 --> 12:37.958
These ain't Twizzlers!

12:37.991 --> 12:39.059
Okay.

12:39.092 --> 12:40.060
(music stops)

12:40.093 --> 12:41.128
Done.

12:42.963 --> 12:45.265
And I want Hakeem to record it.

12:45.298 --> 12:47.234
I can make that happen.

12:47.267 --> 12:48.401
And...

12:48.435 --> 12:50.470
I want to come to that wedding.

12:50.503 --> 12:53.473
See, everybody in the industry
got invited but me.

12:53.506 --> 12:56.476
And I got to say...

12:56.509 --> 12:58.478
my feelings are hurt.

13:00.513 --> 13:02.282
(sighs)

13:03.283 --> 13:05.785
(elevator bell dings)

13:05.819 --> 13:07.620
It's good to be
home, right?

13:07.654 --> 13:08.922
Yeah, sure.

13:08.956 --> 13:11.091
Yo, I'm tired of being
your nurse, bro.

13:11.124 --> 13:13.326
I got other things to do, okay?

13:13.360 --> 13:14.962
I'm getting married
in two days.

13:14.995 --> 13:16.864
All right, that's cool,
'cause first of all,

13:16.897 --> 13:18.631
I don't need y'all
to babysit my ass.

13:18.665 --> 13:19.867
So be gone.

13:19.900 --> 13:21.668
You sure?
I'm certain.

13:21.701 --> 13:24.137
You sure?
We can put a movie on or a game.

13:24.171 --> 13:25.372
I don't want to watch
no damn game.

13:25.405 --> 13:26.606
You're dismissed. Go.

13:26.639 --> 13:27.941
All right, hit me up
if you need something.

13:27.975 --> 13:29.342
Bye. I love you.

13:29.376 --> 13:30.643
Love you, too, fool.

13:32.345 --> 13:33.313
(elevator bell dings)

13:33.346 --> 13:34.347
(clears throat)

13:42.189 --> 13:44.791
So, Rhonda really left?

13:44.824 --> 13:46.493
Yeah, we got a
friend from college

13:46.526 --> 13:49.229
who's, uh, starting up
a jewelry company in L.A.

13:49.262 --> 13:50.797
She went to
check it out.

13:50.830 --> 13:51.999
She'll be back.

13:52.032 --> 13:54.567
Yeah, yeah.
Of course she'll be back.

13:54.601 --> 13:55.969
And don't tell Jamal, okay?

13:56.003 --> 13:58.138
I don't want to give him
anything else to brood about.

13:58.171 --> 13:59.406
Look, I'm worried
about him, Dre.

13:59.439 --> 14:00.807
Yeah, me, too.

14:00.840 --> 14:02.375
And everybody's trying
to help him, you know?

14:02.409 --> 14:04.811
Me, you, Cookie, Becky.

14:04.844 --> 14:05.812
Everybody except...

14:05.845 --> 14:07.814
Lucious.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.582
(chuckles)

14:09.616 --> 14:10.884
Come on, man.

14:10.918 --> 14:12.019
When's the last time

14:12.052 --> 14:14.354
Lucious went out of his
way to help anybody?

14:14.387 --> 14:16.389
Especially one of his own sons.

14:19.692 --> 14:21.628
(door buzzing, lock clicks)

14:25.032 --> 14:26.699
You got ten minutes.

14:26.733 --> 14:28.735
(indistinct chatter)

14:35.708 --> 14:38.211
You know you broke
my heart, Freda.

14:44.051 --> 14:45.852
Why would you try and shoot me?

14:45.885 --> 14:47.054
You know why.

14:47.087 --> 14:48.355
I don't know why.

14:48.388 --> 14:49.556
You killed my father.

14:49.589 --> 14:50.890
Carol told me.

14:50.924 --> 14:53.193
Why would you listen
to a crackhead?

14:53.226 --> 14:56.196
Look, the last conversation
I had with your father

14:56.229 --> 14:57.364
was about you.

14:57.397 --> 14:59.266
Why do you think
I tried to reach out

14:59.299 --> 15:00.533
to you in the first place?

15:00.567 --> 15:02.269
'Cause you felt guilty.

15:02.302 --> 15:04.871
The circumstances under which
me and your father grew up,

15:04.904 --> 15:06.873
the violence?

15:06.906 --> 15:10.777
That's why, when I saw you
when you came to visit him,

15:10.810 --> 15:13.646
and I saw this talent
in you that...

15:13.680 --> 15:15.448
that was something
worth saving.

15:17.617 --> 15:19.252
Promise you,

15:19.286 --> 15:21.388
I never laid a finger
on your daddy.

15:21.421 --> 15:23.656
But this ain't
about him no more.

15:23.690 --> 15:25.392
This is about my son.

15:25.425 --> 15:28.495
This is about Jamal.

15:28.528 --> 15:30.097
You care about him, right?

15:30.130 --> 15:32.465
You know I care
about him.

15:32.499 --> 15:35.235
Yeah, well, he's in
a real bad place right now.

15:35.268 --> 15:37.270
And no matter how you spin it,

15:37.304 --> 15:40.607
he's in that place because of
the choices that you made.

15:42.442 --> 15:43.743
Now...

15:43.776 --> 15:47.747
I don't really care
what anybody think about me.

15:47.780 --> 15:50.583
Yeah, I'm a selfish
son of a bitch.

15:50.617 --> 15:52.419
Life made me like this.

15:52.452 --> 15:54.787
But...

15:54.821 --> 15:56.589
Jamal's not.

15:56.623 --> 15:58.925
And I'm here to help him.

15:58.958 --> 16:00.827
And I can't do that
without you.

16:02.629 --> 16:04.731
I wrote something.

16:14.141 --> 16:16.509
Here.

16:20.880 --> 16:22.882
(hip-hop beat playing
over phone)

16:29.056 --> 16:30.323
If you can start this over,

16:30.357 --> 16:31.658
I think I got something.
(music stops)

16:31.691 --> 16:35.162
Well, if you got something,
why don't we just record it?

16:41.734 --> 16:43.736
(hip-hop beat playing
over phone)

16:50.009 --> 16:52.379
* I wake up in the morning,
what I'm thankful for *

16:52.412 --> 16:54.514
* But you, my God,
is what I'm thankful for *

16:54.547 --> 16:56.549
* I can see my life,
it flash behind yours *

16:56.583 --> 16:58.651
* But when I look at you,
I'm seeing so much more *

16:58.685 --> 17:01.154
* I thank God I could never
get enough of this *

17:01.188 --> 17:03.156
* Now I'm hearing they want me,
I'm such a lucky bitch *

17:03.190 --> 17:05.658
* I'm no killa, but on me
I'm-a clutch the fifth *

17:05.692 --> 17:07.494
* But when I'm with you, boy,
we on a different tip *

17:07.527 --> 17:09.196
* A different tip,
I'm a survivor *

17:09.229 --> 17:11.531
* You know I been through this,
it's like I live through this *

17:11.564 --> 17:13.500
* Everybody know Freda,
she hit the ground and go *

17:13.533 --> 17:16.002
* You put me in the booth
and we tore it down fo' sho' *

17:16.035 --> 17:18.538
* It was time when I didn't have
nothing, you was there for me *

17:18.571 --> 17:20.073
* Instead of pretending, acting
just like you cared for me... *

17:27.414 --> 17:30.383
Hey, Mal.

17:30.417 --> 17:32.419
I went to see
Freda today.

17:36.889 --> 17:39.859
What'd she say?

17:39.892 --> 17:41.228
Not much to me.

17:41.261 --> 17:44.731
She was, uh,
stubborn till the end.

17:44.764 --> 17:47.367
I offered to help her
with her legal representation,

17:47.400 --> 17:49.436
but she refused.

17:51.438 --> 17:54.574
It's 'cause she has
integrity, Dad.

17:54.607 --> 17:56.776
Yeah, well, in the end,
she accepted it.

18:01.614 --> 18:04.117
She wanted me
to give you something.

18:10.590 --> 18:12.559
And just so you know,

18:12.592 --> 18:15.395
I ended the cycle today.

18:15.428 --> 18:17.197
She ain't mad no more.

18:27.006 --> 18:28.508
(elevator bell dings)

18:30.510 --> 18:32.345
(elevator doors close)

18:36.816 --> 18:38.918
FREDA:
* I wake up in the morning

18:38.951 --> 18:40.320
* What I'm thankful for

18:40.353 --> 18:42.289
* But you, my God,
is what I'm thankful for *

18:42.322 --> 18:44.491
* I can see my life,
it flash behind yours *

18:44.524 --> 18:47.093
* But when I look at you,
I'm seeing so much more *

18:47.126 --> 18:48.861
* I thank God I could never
get enough of this *

18:48.895 --> 18:51.097
* Now I'm hearing they want me,
I'm such a lucky bitch *

18:51.130 --> 18:52.799
* I'm no killa, but on me
I'm-a clutch the fifth *

18:52.832 --> 18:55.268
* But when I'm with you, boy,
we on a different tip *

18:55.302 --> 18:57.136
* A different tip,
I'm a survivor *

18:57.170 --> 18:59.506
* You know I been through this,
it's like I live through this *

18:59.539 --> 19:01.708
* Everybody know Freda,
she hit the ground and go *

19:01.741 --> 19:03.943
* You put me in the booth
and we tore it down fo' sho' *

19:03.976 --> 19:06.112
* It was time when I didn't have
nothing, you was there for me *

19:06.145 --> 19:08.348
* Instead of pretending, acting
just like you cared for me *

19:08.381 --> 19:10.483
* And you now I never ran,
never will, homie... *

19:10.517 --> 19:12.018
(music stops)

19:33.673 --> 19:36.309
* There's been a few times
you cried *

19:36.343 --> 19:37.410
(clears throat softly)

19:39.412 --> 19:42.882
* And even more times
they lied *

19:42.915 --> 19:45.218
* Messing with the wrong crowd

19:45.252 --> 19:48.020
* Feeling like
a big cloud's... *

19:59.866 --> 20:02.702
* There's been a few times
you cried *

20:02.735 --> 20:05.171
* Even more times they lied

20:05.204 --> 20:08.375
* Messing with the wrong crowd,
feeling like a big cloud's... *

20:08.408 --> 20:10.510
* La, la, la

20:10.543 --> 20:12.845
* Suddenly the guards
have changed *

20:12.879 --> 20:15.582
* I'm whispering your name.

20:20.620 --> 20:21.954
(silverware clinking on glass)

20:21.988 --> 20:23.756
Toast!

20:23.790 --> 20:26.058
To the new couple.

20:26.092 --> 20:28.395
To Laura and Hakeem.

20:28.428 --> 20:30.363
Tomorrow, you two will be
joined together

20:30.397 --> 20:34.033
in holy matrimony
under the Lyon banner

20:34.066 --> 20:35.568
to carry on the Empire.

20:35.602 --> 20:36.736
Amen.
Cheers!

20:36.769 --> 20:38.771
Turn up!
Cheers.

20:42.475 --> 20:44.411
(clears throat)

20:44.444 --> 20:47.780
Maria tells me Shyne Johnson
is coming to the wedding.

20:47.814 --> 20:49.248
Is this true?

20:49.282 --> 20:51.117
Who's Shyne Johnson?

20:51.150 --> 20:53.453
One of the most notorious
thugs in hip-hop.

20:53.486 --> 20:55.221
You've read about
him, sweetie.

20:55.254 --> 20:56.556
He shot up

20:56.589 --> 20:57.957
that club in Vegas.

20:57.990 --> 20:59.459
He did time for beating
that white rapper.

20:59.492 --> 21:01.260
(chuckles)
Just someone

21:01.294 --> 21:03.896
I wouldn't feel too comfortable
having at my daughter's wedding.

21:03.930 --> 21:07.734
Well, Shyne's
an old family friend.

21:07.767 --> 21:09.402
He's not gonna
be a problem.

21:09.436 --> 21:11.571
ARTURO: Well, it's
a problem for us.

21:11.604 --> 21:13.105
MARIA: We would really
rather he didn't attend.

21:13.139 --> 21:14.807
Look, Maria, Arturo,

21:14.841 --> 21:16.909
they're my parents' people,
okay?

21:16.943 --> 21:18.144
I respect where
they come from.

21:19.612 --> 21:20.780
Mom and Dad,

21:20.813 --> 21:22.615
one of the main reasons
I'm marrying Laura

21:22.649 --> 21:24.417
is to break away
from that history.

21:24.451 --> 21:26.653
Just like Jamal said.

21:26.686 --> 21:29.088
We're gonna start our
own family. Right, babe?

21:29.121 --> 21:31.491
And we ain't gonna listen
to none of that mess.

21:31.524 --> 21:33.426
You and me gonna
end the cycle, baby.

21:33.460 --> 21:34.461
Cheers up.

21:34.494 --> 21:35.828
MARIA: Cheers.
ARTURO: Cheers.

21:35.862 --> 21:37.930
ALL:
Cheers.

21:37.964 --> 21:39.966
(playing up-tempo music)

22:00.553 --> 22:02.655
Y'all, stop, stop, stop!

22:03.656 --> 22:05.825
You both are good.

22:05.858 --> 22:07.360
T.T., your cello
is getting completely lost.

22:07.394 --> 22:09.328
So in between the vocals,
you need to make it soar

22:09.362 --> 22:10.329
a little bit more.

22:10.363 --> 22:11.631
Come on, that's a real moment.

22:11.664 --> 22:12.799
It's for my brother's wedding.

22:12.832 --> 22:14.967
It's got to soar. Soar!

22:15.001 --> 22:17.003
Measure 65 again.

22:19.005 --> 22:21.007
(up-tempo music resumes)

22:48.735 --> 22:51.203
LUCIOUS:
Well, our first priority

22:51.237 --> 22:53.840
is getting out new albums
for Hakeem and Jamal.

22:53.873 --> 22:55.074
Jamal?

22:55.107 --> 22:57.176
Well, I had
a little talk with him,

22:57.209 --> 22:59.979
and I'm pretty sure some music
is gonna come from it.

23:01.548 --> 23:03.416
So, any thoughts?

23:03.450 --> 23:04.917
Mom, Dad, come quick.
It's an emergency.

23:06.385 --> 23:07.887
Give us a minute.

23:12.959 --> 23:14.927
She just ran right out there
before her bodyguard

23:14.961 --> 23:16.028
could stop her.

23:16.062 --> 23:17.363
COOKIE:
Oh, my God.

23:17.396 --> 23:18.665
Anika!

23:24.303 --> 23:26.238
(wind whistling softly)

23:31.177 --> 23:32.712
COOKIE: Anika?
HAKEEM: Mom.

23:32.745 --> 23:34.380
Anika! What's going on?

23:34.413 --> 23:35.548
Get back.

23:35.582 --> 23:36.983
Anika?

23:37.016 --> 23:38.818
What's going on, baby?

23:38.851 --> 23:40.086
Huh?

23:40.119 --> 23:41.888
I'd rather kill myself

23:41.921 --> 23:43.556
than to be forced
to snitch on Lucious.

23:43.590 --> 23:44.657
No, no, no, no, no, no.

23:44.691 --> 23:46.125
We're not gonna
let that happen to you.

23:46.158 --> 23:48.294
They're gonna make me testify.
They're gonna put me in

23:48.327 --> 23:50.062
the witness protection program.
I can't do that.

23:50.096 --> 23:51.263
COOKIE:
Tell her, Lucious.

23:51.297 --> 23:53.332
Hey, I got good news for you.

23:53.365 --> 23:56.636
Thirsty found out that the Feds
got to put on their trial

23:56.669 --> 23:58.437
before the
grand jury...
(screams)

23:58.471 --> 24:00.439
...in a day and a half,
sweetheart.

24:00.473 --> 24:03.109
So all you got to do is
be cool for two more days.

24:03.142 --> 24:04.644
Anika?

24:07.480 --> 24:09.281
Look...

24:09.315 --> 24:11.484
I know we had
bad blood between us.

24:13.486 --> 24:15.287
But you are carrying a life.

24:16.789 --> 24:18.791
My grandson.

24:20.793 --> 24:22.194
So you'll never be alone.

24:22.228 --> 24:23.229
You hear me?

24:24.497 --> 24:27.166
'Cause I know
what that feels like.

24:27.199 --> 24:30.169
(Anika sobbing softly)

24:30.202 --> 24:31.804
You're a Lyon now.

24:31.838 --> 24:34.273
Okay?

24:34.306 --> 24:36.275
Isn't that what
you always wanted?

24:36.308 --> 24:37.810
Huh?

24:37.844 --> 24:39.512
To be one of us?

24:41.548 --> 24:43.015
Yeah?

24:43.049 --> 24:44.617
I know.

24:44.651 --> 24:45.818
It's gonna be okay. I know.

24:45.852 --> 24:47.620
(sobbing)
It's gonna
be all right.

24:47.654 --> 24:49.522
Come on.
It's gonna be all right.

24:49.556 --> 24:50.857
Come on.

24:52.892 --> 24:54.961
Hey, check it out.

24:54.994 --> 24:56.362
Let's take it
from the bridge, huh?
Okay.

24:56.395 --> 24:58.397
Everybody ready?

25:00.499 --> 25:01.834
Two, three,

25:01.868 --> 25:02.969
four, one...

25:03.002 --> 25:05.672
* Whoa-o, whoa-o, whoa

25:05.705 --> 25:10.009
* Ooh, ooh-ooh

25:10.042 --> 25:11.544
* Ooh, ooh-ooh...

25:11.578 --> 25:13.045
D-MAJOR:
You know I came by

25:13.079 --> 25:15.648
the hospital to visit you,
but your dad didn't let me in.

25:15.682 --> 25:17.550
* Ooh, ooh-ooh

25:17.584 --> 25:19.986
* I'm-a keep on loving

25:20.019 --> 25:22.154
* Loving you

25:22.188 --> 25:24.824
* Ooh, ooh...

25:24.857 --> 25:26.158
Y'all. Y'all.

25:26.192 --> 25:28.027
Jeff. Jeff.
(singing stops)

25:28.060 --> 25:29.195
First of all, I love it.

25:29.228 --> 25:30.663
JEFF:
Thank you, man.
I really do.

25:30.697 --> 25:33.032
Um, the only change
that I would say is

25:33.065 --> 25:35.034
there's a moment
where I'm singing, um...

25:35.067 --> 25:37.169
* I'm gonna keep on
loving you. *

25:37.203 --> 25:39.005
So instead of, um...

25:39.038 --> 25:40.506
instead of just
doing the "oohs,"

25:40.539 --> 25:42.875
can we just say, uh...
* Loving you.

25:42.909 --> 25:44.076
Oh, yeah, I like that.
Yeah.

25:44.110 --> 25:45.077
Everybody got that?

25:45.111 --> 25:47.580
Two, three, four, one...

25:47.614 --> 25:50.249
* Whoa-o, whoa-o, whoa

25:50.282 --> 25:54.386
* Loving you

25:55.421 --> 25:59.125
* Loving you

26:00.126 --> 26:03.730
* Loving you

26:04.764 --> 26:07.366
* Loving you

26:07.399 --> 26:09.769
* Just keep on loving you

26:09.802 --> 26:12.905
* Loving you...
Ah! (hisses)

26:12.939 --> 26:14.607
No, no, no, no, I'm good,
I'm good, I'm good.
You all right?

26:14.641 --> 26:15.608
You sure?
Yeah, yeah, I'm good.

26:15.642 --> 26:16.609
Uh, you know what?

26:16.643 --> 26:17.710
Let's just continue this later,

26:17.744 --> 26:18.878
when Jamal feels
a little better...

26:18.911 --> 26:20.279
No. Absolutely not.

26:20.312 --> 26:21.614
Do not listen to him.
Come on, y'all.

26:21.648 --> 26:23.249
We have to be done
by tomorrow.

26:23.282 --> 26:25.051
I'm fine. Come on.

26:25.084 --> 26:26.719
I'm okay.

26:26.753 --> 26:27.887
Yeah?
I'm fine.

26:27.920 --> 26:29.555
Calm that ass down.

26:29.588 --> 26:31.423
Two, three, four, one, two...
Come on, y'all,
let's sing.

26:31.457 --> 26:34.593
* Loving you

26:36.028 --> 26:39.932
* Loving you

26:40.933 --> 26:44.336
* Loving you

26:45.471 --> 26:49.408
* Loving you

26:49.441 --> 26:50.409
* Said it feels good

26:50.442 --> 26:51.577
* Loving you

26:51.610 --> 26:54.146
* Just to keep on loving you

26:54.180 --> 26:56.582
* Hey, said it feels good
* Loving you

26:56.615 --> 26:59.652
* Just to keep on
loving you, oh *

26:59.686 --> 27:02.755
* Said, oh, baby
* Loving you

27:02.789 --> 27:04.423
* Ooh

27:04.456 --> 27:06.158
* Loving you

27:06.192 --> 27:09.428
(imitating percussion)

27:09.461 --> 27:12.098
* Loving you...

27:12.131 --> 27:14.967
What you did for Jamal...

27:15.001 --> 27:16.969
nobody else could've
done that, Lucious.

27:17.003 --> 27:18.104
Come on.

27:18.137 --> 27:19.605
Got me over
here thinking

27:19.638 --> 27:21.774
maybe you ain't the
devil after all.

27:21.808 --> 27:23.943
(laughs)

27:23.976 --> 27:26.679
What, you think
I care about that boy?

27:26.713 --> 27:28.815
He make me
a whole lot of money.

27:28.848 --> 27:31.684
Ah!
Stop it.

27:31.718 --> 27:33.886
You know I like it
when you do it harder.

27:33.920 --> 27:35.221
Oh, God.

27:37.156 --> 27:40.860
I swear, I hope all this crap
is over with the Feds.

27:40.893 --> 27:44.363
Especially when they come up
empty with the grand jury.

27:44.396 --> 27:46.365
Mm.
Yeah, well, they seem
to have backed off.

27:46.398 --> 27:48.835
Maybe Tariq the Freak
got his wrist slapped.

27:48.868 --> 27:49.869
(chuckles)

27:53.840 --> 27:55.842
You know, none of this stuff
would've happened

27:55.875 --> 27:58.845
if you'd been around.

27:58.878 --> 28:00.813
I was never any good
without you.

28:00.847 --> 28:02.481
All right, Lucious.

28:02.514 --> 28:04.183
Stop all that
talk, man.
What?

28:04.216 --> 28:05.351
(laughs)

28:05.384 --> 28:07.319
You know that never ends
well for me and you.

28:07.353 --> 28:08.354
Cut it out.

28:11.023 --> 28:14.260
I should've never let you go.

28:14.293 --> 28:16.628
There's a reason
I never married anybody else.

28:21.901 --> 28:25.704
Look, let's just get your
son married tomorrow.

28:25.738 --> 28:27.506
Maybe we'll talk.

28:27.539 --> 28:29.341
Ooh, I like maybe.
(scoffs)

28:29.375 --> 28:30.777
Let's toast to maybe.

28:30.810 --> 28:31.778
Maybe.

28:31.811 --> 28:32.879
Maybe.
Maybe.

28:32.912 --> 28:35.081
Maybe if that
noodle works.

28:35.114 --> 28:36.849
Give me one of them
blue pills.

28:36.883 --> 28:37.884
(both laughing)

28:37.917 --> 28:39.351
Good-bye, Lucious.

28:39.385 --> 28:41.520
Dirty old man.
Mm!

28:41.553 --> 28:43.522
Hmm.
I like watching
you walk away.

28:43.555 --> 28:44.523
I know you do.

28:44.556 --> 28:45.524
Twerk it for me.

28:45.557 --> 28:47.860
Ah, ah, ah...!
(laughs)

28:47.894 --> 28:49.595
Get your ones out.
Ah, ah...!

28:49.628 --> 28:50.696
* I can show you something

28:50.729 --> 28:52.564
* That ain't none of them can

28:52.598 --> 28:54.533
* 'Cause I, 'cause I

28:54.566 --> 28:58.537
* 'Cause I ain't too cool
to dance... *

28:58.570 --> 29:00.372
So handsome.

29:00.406 --> 29:02.374
Even you, Hakeem.

29:02.408 --> 29:04.110
I don't know why
I thought you were ugly.

29:04.143 --> 29:05.878
(laughs)
Grandma.

29:05.912 --> 29:07.546
Really?
(chuckles)

29:07.579 --> 29:09.916
Grandma, what did you mean
when you said that we were, um,

29:09.949 --> 29:12.084
paying for the crimes
of Dad's dad?

29:12.118 --> 29:13.786
Dwight don't want me
talking about that.

29:13.820 --> 29:15.087
Well, we are who we are,
Grandma,

29:15.121 --> 29:17.256
despite whether our father
wants to talk about it.

29:17.289 --> 29:18.891
Well, you're right.

29:18.925 --> 29:20.226
You can't escape it.

29:20.259 --> 29:22.228
It's in him,
it's in most of his cousins,

29:22.261 --> 29:23.229
it's bound to be

29:23.262 --> 29:24.463
in you three.

29:24.496 --> 29:26.598
Or at least
one of you.

29:26.632 --> 29:29.101
As for Joe...

29:29.135 --> 29:31.904
well, Joe got what he deserved.

29:31.938 --> 29:33.239
Wait, Joe?

29:33.272 --> 29:34.640
That's...
that's our grandfather.

29:36.375 --> 29:37.709
(grunting)

29:41.647 --> 29:43.649
You're a dead man, Joe.

29:50.957 --> 29:52.825
He saw his father die
in front of him?

29:52.859 --> 29:54.994
Who shot him?

29:55.027 --> 29:57.296
Don't believe
anything she tell you.

29:57.329 --> 29:59.932
Actually, she was just telling
us how handsome we all look.

29:59.966 --> 30:00.933
Right, Grandma?

30:00.967 --> 30:02.268
Mm-hmm.

30:02.301 --> 30:04.103
ANDRE:
Come on, Hakeem.

30:04.136 --> 30:06.772
Let's go welcome
your guests, man.

30:06.805 --> 30:07.773
Let's go.
(sighs)

30:07.806 --> 30:09.108
Why we got to do it?
Why we got to do it?

30:09.141 --> 30:10.476
'Cause it's your job!

30:19.718 --> 30:22.955
* You say we fight

30:22.989 --> 30:26.158
* I'll say we argue

30:26.192 --> 30:29.161
* Maybe you're right

30:29.195 --> 30:31.530
* That we really
are through... *

30:31.563 --> 30:33.866
Hakeem, I'm mad at y'all.

30:33.900 --> 30:36.135
Y'all ain't got no chicken,
no pork chops, no nothing.
Hi!

30:36.168 --> 30:37.669
I had to bring
my own doughnut.

30:37.703 --> 30:39.872
Get that out of here, Porsha.
Give me a hug.

30:39.906 --> 30:42.141
* That's what I'm gonna do...

30:42.174 --> 30:44.343
Hi.

30:46.012 --> 30:49.015
* You say it's mine...

30:49.048 --> 30:51.350
Well, Rosey, you don't
look a day over 60.

30:51.383 --> 30:53.986
You know I roll younger than
that, Cookie. Talk to me.

30:54.020 --> 30:56.022
You better watch out.
Don't you piss Lucious off.

30:56.055 --> 30:57.056
Ooh.

30:57.089 --> 30:58.324
(laughs)

30:58.357 --> 30:59.391
Hey, there he is.

30:59.425 --> 31:01.360
Man of the hour.
Congratulations, Hakeem.

31:01.393 --> 31:02.995
Thank you, thank you.

31:03.029 --> 31:04.563
Sure you ready to
do this, young man?

31:04.596 --> 31:05.864
I did it three times,

31:05.898 --> 31:07.733
and now I got three
alimony checks.

31:07.766 --> 31:09.568
(laughter)
Cut it out.

31:09.601 --> 31:11.103
Look, I never been
so sure about anything.

31:11.137 --> 31:12.504
All right.
Good luck to you.
Okay?

31:12.538 --> 31:14.673
Rosey!

31:14.706 --> 31:16.075
(laughs)
What's up,
my brother?

31:16.108 --> 31:17.576
All right.
Tommy, Tommy.

31:17.609 --> 31:19.245
How are you, my friend?
Thank you all for coming.

31:19.278 --> 31:21.013
Y'all know my son Jamal.

31:21.047 --> 31:23.715
Yeah. I been watching
your every move.

31:23.749 --> 31:25.684
I was proud of you
at the ASAs.

31:25.717 --> 31:26.852
Well, thank you.

31:26.885 --> 31:28.387
Yeah, the whole world
was proud of him.

31:28.420 --> 31:31.190
I'm talking about before
he took that bullet for you, L.

31:31.223 --> 31:33.559
I can't wait to hear
what you do

31:33.592 --> 31:35.027
when you cut loose
your father and mother.

31:35.061 --> 31:37.729
No.
Why you trying to
start stuff, man?

31:37.763 --> 31:39.431
Man, eagle got to fly.

31:39.465 --> 31:40.866
No, no, it's all love,
you know?

31:40.899 --> 31:42.101
I am doing my new single though.

31:42.134 --> 31:43.435
And it's, uh,
it's produced by D-Major.

31:43.469 --> 31:44.770
All right.

31:44.803 --> 31:48.407
* That's what you want me to

31:48.440 --> 31:53.579
* Ooh...

31:59.318 --> 32:00.886
Yes.
Yes!

32:00.919 --> 32:01.954
(crowd cheering)
Fantastic!

32:05.791 --> 32:07.893
One of our number one artists.

32:07.926 --> 32:09.928
(classical music playing)

32:12.931 --> 32:15.067
(raucous laughter)

32:15.101 --> 32:17.103
(laughter, chatter)

32:19.338 --> 32:20.472
Oh, what's that?

32:20.506 --> 32:22.241
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, hold on.

32:22.274 --> 32:23.942
* Let the champagne spill...

32:25.444 --> 32:27.313
Hold that, baby. Uh.

32:27.346 --> 32:28.480
Mmm!
(giggles)

32:28.514 --> 32:30.482
Mmm! Mmm.

32:30.516 --> 32:32.318
(laughs)

32:32.351 --> 32:35.454
Look at that clown.
You invited Shyne?

32:35.487 --> 32:37.923
He brought hookers
to your son's wedding.

32:37.956 --> 32:39.925
Oh, oh! Uh!
Look at that!

32:39.958 --> 32:41.093
(laughing)

32:41.127 --> 32:42.594
I'm out of here, L.

32:42.628 --> 32:44.263
No, no, no, no, no.
Come on.
No, no, no, no.

32:44.296 --> 32:46.432
Come with us into
the other room.

32:46.465 --> 32:47.766
Feds is still sniffing around,

32:47.799 --> 32:50.602
and we have to make sure
Shyne behaves.

32:50.636 --> 32:52.938
It's precautionary,
mostly.

32:52.971 --> 32:55.441
Mad 'cause they got
a bag full of nothing,

32:55.474 --> 32:57.976
just a lame-ass task force
who came up empty

32:58.010 --> 33:00.546
on something I didn't do.

33:00.579 --> 33:01.547
Free Lucious.

33:01.580 --> 33:02.881
Hell of a concert.

33:02.914 --> 33:04.650
COOKIE:
Yes, thank you.

33:04.683 --> 33:06.985
Now, uh, you guys know
how the Feds work,

33:07.019 --> 33:09.755
or else you wouldn't have stayed
clear of them all these years.

33:11.823 --> 33:13.792
So it is very important
that we keep Shyne

33:13.825 --> 33:16.662
as a part of
our circle of silence.

33:16.695 --> 33:19.565
Yeah, but if somebody
already gave them Shyne...

33:19.598 --> 33:21.833
It means Shyne's not
our only problem.

33:21.867 --> 33:23.502
(sighs)

33:23.535 --> 33:26.172
Well, there was
a couple of friends that...

33:26.205 --> 33:28.640
Let's just say they're not
around to snitch anymore.

33:28.674 --> 33:29.941
LUCIOUS:
They've recently retired.

33:31.610 --> 33:33.011
Now, Shyne on
the other hand,

33:33.045 --> 33:35.013
you know, he's
just a kid.

33:35.047 --> 33:37.649
He wants to be part
of the club again.

33:37.683 --> 33:40.152
All right, Lucious.

33:40.186 --> 33:43.755
But nothing good can come
from Shyne's punk ass.

33:43.789 --> 33:45.257
Understood.

33:45.291 --> 33:47.293
We'll just entertain him
for a bit, okay?

33:49.027 --> 33:49.995
Let's go do
this wedding.

33:50.028 --> 33:51.797
That's a plan.

33:59.371 --> 34:01.673
We love you, my darling.

34:01.707 --> 34:03.509
We only want the
best for you.

34:03.542 --> 34:06.145
We hope Hakeem
keeps you safe.

34:07.913 --> 34:09.915
*

34:18.590 --> 34:20.792
(speaks indistinctly)

34:31.437 --> 34:34.072
(chuckles) I'm putting you
all on notice right now.

34:34.106 --> 34:36.408
My brother about
to drop this album.

34:36.442 --> 34:38.710
All y'all gonna want a piece
of this one. It's hot.

34:38.744 --> 34:40.146
Hey, I know
it's all crazy,

34:40.179 --> 34:41.313
but it's all gonna
work out, okay?

34:41.347 --> 34:43.215
Thank you for
coming, Anika.

34:43.249 --> 34:45.551
Anika Calhoun,
you've been served.

34:45.584 --> 34:46.918
See you in court.
What?!

34:47.619 --> 34:49.588
(people gasping)

34:49.621 --> 34:51.423
No!
What's happening?

34:52.258 --> 34:53.892
COOKIE:
Stop! Stop her!

34:53.925 --> 34:56.094
Move!
MAN: Sir, get out of the way!

34:59.365 --> 35:01.233
Get off!

35:01.267 --> 35:02.901
Get off!

35:02.934 --> 35:05.237
Mm-hmm. Grand jury.

35:05.271 --> 35:07.173
What the hell
is going on?

35:07.206 --> 35:08.440
SHYNE:
What?!

35:08.474 --> 35:10.442
Get off me!

35:10.476 --> 35:11.843
Get off me!

35:11.877 --> 35:13.745
ARTURO: This is exactly
what I was talking about.

35:13.779 --> 35:15.247
I'm putting a stop to it.

35:15.281 --> 35:16.415
Shyne, you're
a damn fool!

35:16.448 --> 35:18.250
That's why we dumped you
the first time

35:18.284 --> 35:20.419
and why we keep
your ghetto ass in place!

35:20.452 --> 35:21.453
HAKEEM:
Laura, wait!

35:26.325 --> 35:28.160
(sobs)

35:28.194 --> 35:30.162
Baby, I got it all
under control.

35:30.196 --> 35:31.630
It was just a little argument.

35:31.663 --> 35:32.631
It's gonna be okay.

35:32.664 --> 35:34.266
It's not okay anymore, Hakeem.

35:34.300 --> 35:35.367
I can't.

35:35.401 --> 35:36.702
This isn't gonna be my life.

35:36.735 --> 35:38.036
I'm sorry.
Baby, I'm sorry.

35:38.069 --> 35:39.137
I can't do this.

35:39.171 --> 35:40.105
Let go of me!

35:40.138 --> 35:41.773
It's gonna be all right.

35:41.807 --> 35:43.108
You're all a
bunch of thugs.

35:43.141 --> 35:45.143
Please don't go.

36:02.694 --> 36:03.995
LUCIOUS:
Okay.

36:04.029 --> 36:06.665
Everybody get
the hell out of here.

36:06.698 --> 36:07.566
Go on!

36:07.599 --> 36:08.967
Now!

36:09.000 --> 36:10.336
I said go!

36:11.337 --> 36:12.804
Walk away. Go!
Lucious, stop it!

36:12.838 --> 36:15.507
LUCIOUS:
I'm not playing!

36:15.541 --> 36:16.908
Webb, shut the door!

36:16.942 --> 36:19.411
ANIKA: All right, look,
just tell me what to do.

36:19.445 --> 36:20.912
I'll do whatever it takes
in order to not testify.

36:23.882 --> 36:25.351
Okay, the
hell with it.

36:25.384 --> 36:26.652
Thirsty,

36:26.685 --> 36:29.755
if Anika and I
get married...
Wait, what?

36:29.788 --> 36:31.657
...the Feds can't force her
to testify-- right or wrong?

36:31.690 --> 36:33.325
Lucious.
THIRSTY: That thought
crossed my mind,

36:33.359 --> 36:34.826
but you'd need a
marriage license.

36:34.860 --> 36:35.827
The Feds would
definitely block that.

36:35.861 --> 36:37.429
We already got
that covered

36:37.463 --> 36:38.864
when we were
engaged in D.C.

36:38.897 --> 36:40.699
Lucious! I'm warning you.

36:40.732 --> 36:42.167
You're warning me what?

36:42.200 --> 36:43.835
No, you can't do it.
This is my wedding.

36:43.869 --> 36:45.237
She carrying my baby.

36:45.271 --> 36:46.538
Yeah, man, are we sick
or something?

36:46.572 --> 36:48.073
Is... We were supposed
to end the cycle.

36:48.106 --> 36:49.875
Cycle ends when
it's ready to end.

36:49.908 --> 36:51.843
Till then, we do
what we have to do.

36:51.877 --> 36:55.814
I did not save this bitch's life
so that she could ruin mine.

36:57.048 --> 36:59.285
There's got to be another way.

36:59.318 --> 37:00.952
No, there ain't no other way.

37:00.986 --> 37:04.122
Look, look, this is
just a paper game.

37:04.155 --> 37:06.792
It ain't real. It doesn't
affect where you and I are.

37:06.825 --> 37:09.194
THIRSTY: Hey, Lucious,
this has to be done tonight.

37:09.227 --> 37:11.363
We're ride or die.

37:11.397 --> 37:14.866
I need you
on this one.

37:14.900 --> 37:17.202
You got to ride
with me on this one.

37:17.235 --> 37:19.237
(scoffs)

37:25.243 --> 37:27.245
Y'all know I love you, right?

37:27.279 --> 37:29.881
You know.

37:29.915 --> 37:33.719
And I'm-a do
whatever I can...

37:33.752 --> 37:35.421
to save my family.

37:39.124 --> 37:42.594
But me and your daddy...

37:42.628 --> 37:44.563
I can't do this.

37:44.596 --> 37:45.764
Get your hands off me!

37:45.797 --> 37:47.198
(breath quivering)

37:48.434 --> 37:48.934
Ma.

37:48.967 --> 37:49.034
No. No.

37:56.542 --> 38:00.846
Anika Calhoun,
do you take Lucious Lyon

38:00.879 --> 38:03.114
to be your lawfully
wedded husband?

38:10.456 --> 38:12.123
I do.

38:14.125 --> 38:15.761
ANDRE:
Lucious Lyon,

38:15.794 --> 38:19.398
do you take Anika Calhoun
to be your wife?

38:21.967 --> 38:23.935
I do.

38:23.969 --> 38:26.938
ANDRE: With the powers
conferred on me

38:26.972 --> 38:29.575
by the state of New York,
before God...

38:32.644 --> 38:34.112
...and your family,

38:34.145 --> 38:36.314
I declare you're married.

38:38.016 --> 38:39.418
You may kiss the bride.

38:55.000 --> 38:56.502
Sing.

38:58.203 --> 39:01.206
THIRSTY: You heard your
father. Get up and sing.

39:07.178 --> 39:09.515
I know you pushed her.

39:13.351 --> 39:15.353
Excuse me for a
minute, please.

39:21.092 --> 39:23.429
*

39:52.658 --> 39:54.893
*

40:22.821 --> 40:26.091
So it just never occurred to you
that this kid is gonna be...

40:26.124 --> 40:28.093
you're gonna be his daddy
and granddaddy.

40:28.126 --> 40:30.095
It is what it is.

40:30.128 --> 40:31.930
THIRSTY: Yo, heads up.
It's Tariq Cousins.

40:31.963 --> 40:34.432
Ooh. What's up, brother?

40:34.466 --> 40:36.468
Huh?
HAKEEM: Who's Tariq?

40:38.203 --> 40:40.672
Congratulate you
on your unholy matrimony.

40:40.706 --> 40:42.140
Amen.
Mm.

40:42.173 --> 40:43.475
Why y'all keep chasing

40:43.509 --> 40:46.945
after me, man,
when you keep coming up empty?

40:46.978 --> 40:48.480
Why-why waste the
taxpayers' money like that?

40:48.514 --> 40:49.948
Means we're well funded.

40:49.981 --> 40:52.417
Believe me,
we just getting started.

40:52.450 --> 40:55.887
Dwight, what's your
half brother doing here?

41:05.363 --> 41:06.698
Kill me.

41:06.732 --> 41:07.933
You'll go down

41:07.966 --> 41:09.434
for killing a cop.

41:09.467 --> 41:11.202
And your son will grow up
without a father.

41:11.236 --> 41:12.938
That boy
ain't my son, Joe.

41:12.971 --> 41:13.972
He's yours.

41:16.241 --> 41:19.878
Now him and Dwight will both
grow up without a father.

41:27.653 --> 41:29.788
Daddy!

41:29.821 --> 41:31.456
Daddy! Dad, Dad, Dad!

41:31.489 --> 41:32.591
Dad!

41:34.325 --> 41:36.562
Daddy!

41:36.595 --> 41:37.596
Dad...

41:39.097 --> 41:41.066
Oh, you really
didn't know, huh?

41:41.099 --> 41:43.935
Yeah, our father was
a good cop, Dwight.

41:45.336 --> 41:47.138
But a bad man.

41:47.172 --> 41:50.008
I guess we each got
half of him, man.

41:54.045 --> 41:56.347
My name Lucious.

41:56.381 --> 41:59.017
And, baby, I ain't
got no family.

41:59.050 --> 42:02.353
Hey, Dre, get my wife.

42:04.122 --> 42:05.624
THIRSTY:
I got it.

42:07.859 --> 42:10.095
(chuckles)

42:12.898 --> 42:14.900

42:36.254 --> 42:37.723
(grunts)

42:40.291 --> 42:42.293
(gasping)

42:43.895 --> 42:46.732
(screaming)

42:46.765 --> 42:48.366
You wanted that devil child

42:48.399 --> 42:50.535
to be the only heir
to the throne, didn't you?

42:50.568 --> 42:52.203
Didn't you?!

42:52.237 --> 42:54.405
You're damn right I did,
you bitch!

42:54.439 --> 42:55.774
(screams)

42:58.810 --> 43:01.079
(both grunting)

43:15.761 --> 43:17.095
(bloodcurdling scream)
No!

43:53.564 --> 43:55.000
Yeah.

43:55.033 --> 43:57.035
