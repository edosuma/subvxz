00:15.800 --> 00:17.767
Alex, my friend.

00:17.835 --> 00:20.437
- You're late.
- Am I?

00:20.505 --> 00:23.507
- Did you make the exchange?
- Does the boss know

00:23.575 --> 00:26.709
you're spending all his money
on bogus passports?

00:26.776 --> 00:31.046
These are worth their weight
in gold, amigo. He'll see.

00:31.115 --> 00:33.082
But there's a problem.

00:33.150 --> 00:35.380
You've been seen somewhere
you shouldn't have been.

00:35.500 --> 00:37.189
You know I wouldn't
do something so stupid.

00:37.309 --> 00:40.823
You've been hiding
something from me, Alex.

00:40.890 --> 00:43.325
Hector, I can explain.

00:43.392 --> 00:45.827
You've been playing
a very dangerous game!

for www.addic7ed.com

01:25.101 --> 01:27.369
- All right, thank you.
- Hey.

01:27.437 --> 01:30.038
So, what does this Monday
morning have for us?

01:30.106 --> 01:34.410
Male, around 40,
shot three times at close range.

01:34.477 --> 01:37.178
- Do we have an ID?
- Nothing confirmed,

01:37.246 --> 01:40.415
but he's got a graffiti-style
tattoo on his back,

01:40.482 --> 01:43.384
and what looks like...
it could be tattoo removal

01:43.452 --> 01:45.420
on his face and neck.

01:45.487 --> 01:47.855
It could be linked to one
of the Central American gangs.

01:47.923 --> 01:49.957
His Beemer's being impounded
as we speak.

01:50.025 --> 01:51.926
There's no registration,
of course.

01:51.993 --> 01:54.595
Well, nice clothes, fancy car.
If he is a Latin American

01:54.663 --> 01:56.897
street thug,
he's certainly had a makeover.

01:56.964 --> 01:59.065
But why did Metro bring us
into this?

01:59.133 --> 02:03.102
Ah. First responders found
these under the body.

02:03.170 --> 02:04.638
Passports.

02:04.705 --> 02:08.041
A couple of Latino guys
in their early 20s.

02:08.108 --> 02:10.911
- Huh. Are these real?
- Or forged, or fake. Not sure.

02:10.978 --> 02:13.646
Well, if they're fakes,
they're pretty good.

02:13.713 --> 02:15.648
Makes me wonder how many more
of these gangbangers are

02:15.715 --> 02:17.817
making their way into our
country under bogus identities.

02:17.884 --> 02:20.619
Gotta love Mondays.
Let's go.

02:27.226 --> 02:29.360
Hector Suarez.

02:29.428 --> 02:31.362
Yep, that's him.

02:31.430 --> 02:33.998
A suspected higher-up
in a Central American

02:34.066 --> 02:35.967
crime syndicate. He's been
on the RCMP and DEA's

02:36.034 --> 02:37.969
watch lists since he showed up
here a couple of months ago.

02:38.036 --> 02:39.397
What do we have from the scene?

02:39.517 --> 02:42.239
Well, there's no ballistics
match on the kill-shot bullets,

02:42.307 --> 02:44.775
but the passports turned out
to be high-end forgeries.

02:44.843 --> 02:46.777
I thought that was becoming
next to impossible.

02:46.845 --> 02:48.812
The typesetting was done
by someone who definitely knew

02:48.880 --> 02:50.848
what they were doing,
but the booklets themselves,

02:50.915 --> 02:54.685
they were the real deal. So, someone got
a hold of a bunch of blank passports.

02:54.752 --> 02:57.588
According to Passport Canada,
the ones we found were obsolete

02:57.655 --> 02:59.689
and slated to be destroyed.
The new books will feature

02:59.756 --> 03:01.891
a digital information chip.
Much higher security.

03:01.959 --> 03:04.226
Sounds like our criminal
friends got their hands on them

03:04.294 --> 03:06.261
- just in time.
- The passport office is doing

03:06.329 --> 03:08.698
an inventory, but this could
just be the tip of the iceberg.

03:08.765 --> 03:11.050
I'll work with them and see if I
can find any security breach.

03:11.170 --> 03:12.869
- Okay.
-According to our intel,

03:12.936 --> 03:14.837
Hector reported
to Roman Delgado.

03:14.905 --> 03:17.499
He's a textile importer
and a suspected kingpin

03:17.619 --> 03:19.758
in an emerging Latin American
crime ring right here.

03:19.825 --> 03:21.826
So who knows how many fakes
could be out there.

03:21.894 --> 03:23.995
There could be an army
descending on the city

03:24.063 --> 03:26.029
trying to carve out their own
piece of the pie.

03:26.097 --> 03:29.667
- Find out what Roman Delgado knows.
- You got it.

03:34.839 --> 03:36.374
Thanks.

03:41.211 --> 03:46.048
Finally I get to welcome
the police in my humble home.

03:46.116 --> 03:50.353
Usually you people are watching
from afar.

03:50.421 --> 03:53.156
I'm Sergeant McCluskey, this
is Special Consultant Logan.

03:53.223 --> 03:55.258
We're from a Special
Investigations Unit.

03:55.326 --> 03:57.526
Special investigations.

03:57.594 --> 03:59.528
I'm flattered,
but not surprised.

03:59.596 --> 04:01.630
You have quite the reputation
back home.

04:01.698 --> 04:03.732
Is that why you fled?

04:03.801 --> 04:08.204
Any successful businessman
in my home country is a target.

04:08.272 --> 04:09.738
It can be dangerous.

04:09.807 --> 04:12.014
- So I came here.
- To sell textiles.

04:12.134 --> 04:16.543
I import fine fabrics and sell
them to manufacturers. Espresso?

04:16.612 --> 04:19.947
Did you know Hector Suarez?

04:20.016 --> 04:21.716
We were close.

04:21.784 --> 04:25.353
- It's a tragedy he was killed.
- Do you have any idea

04:25.421 --> 04:28.223
- who would want him dead, or why?
- All I know is

04:28.291 --> 04:31.658
he was new to this country.
He was working very hard

04:31.726 --> 04:33.861
to make a better life.

04:33.929 --> 04:36.197
The numbers are coming in.
You can have them all.

04:36.264 --> 04:38.432
- Wait...
- This is the only way.

04:38.499 --> 04:40.868
Was he helping you
expand your business?

04:40.936 --> 04:43.408
If he was, that wouldn't
sit well with the competition.

04:43.528 --> 04:44.661
I don't know what you mean.

04:44.781 --> 04:47.154
Was he looking for trouble?
Did you trust him?

04:47.274 --> 04:50.576
Hector had ways of making
enemies in the old country, hm?

04:50.644 --> 04:52.846
I do things differently.

04:52.913 --> 04:55.715
- Gabrielle.
<i>- Perdón.</i>

04:55.782 --> 04:57.217
I'm sorry. You are busy.

04:57.284 --> 04:59.819
This is nothing
that can't wait.

04:59.887 --> 05:02.687
These are my special
investigator friends

05:02.755 --> 05:04.756
McCluskey and Logan.

05:04.824 --> 05:08.360
- Did you know Hector?
- Hector was her fiancé.

05:08.427 --> 05:11.196
This country is supposed
to be safe.

05:11.264 --> 05:13.698
We come here
to escape the violence.

05:13.766 --> 05:16.034
Violence has a way
of finding people.

05:16.102 --> 05:18.936
- My condolences.
- Thank you.

05:19.004 --> 05:21.372
Look, this is not
the best time.

05:21.439 --> 05:23.774
OK. Well, if you think
of anything else,

05:23.842 --> 05:26.710
- please give us a call.
- Thank you.

05:30.749 --> 05:32.983
Delgado wasn't
helpful.

05:33.050 --> 05:35.952
Not completely, I got Hector telling
him that "numbers" are coming.

05:36.020 --> 05:38.554
- As in, people?
- Yeah, I think so.

05:38.622 --> 05:40.290
Superintendent Martell.

05:40.358 --> 05:42.425
To what do we owe the pleasure?

05:42.493 --> 05:46.196
I've been sent from on high to
check up on my favourite IIB unit.

05:46.316 --> 05:47.429
Oh.

05:47.549 --> 05:50.099
So, where are we in
the passport security leak?

05:50.166 --> 05:52.034
Well, it's leading us
into the criminal underworld.

05:52.102 --> 05:54.103
There seems to be
a new Latin gang in town,

05:54.170 --> 05:56.372
- and they're bringing in muscle.
- And according to our intel,

05:56.439 --> 05:59.174
the Kingston Connection is
none too happy with that.

05:59.242 --> 06:02.278
Chris Jernigan, their leader,
does not like competition,

06:02.345 --> 06:04.846
and Hector
Suarez paid the price.

06:04.966 --> 06:05.995
Interesting.

06:06.115 --> 06:09.821
Well, if we make a break in the
passport case, you'll be the first to know.

06:12.288 --> 06:14.222
Maybe Suarez was
a loose cannon.

06:14.290 --> 06:16.891
Well, if the Kingston
Connection heard

06:16.959 --> 06:19.994
about Delgado's plan
to bring in gang reinforcements,

06:20.062 --> 06:23.063
Martell is right,
they could have an axe to grind.

06:27.135 --> 06:29.403
All right.

06:29.470 --> 06:33.006
Mr. Jernigan? IIB.

06:33.074 --> 06:35.108
"Mr. Jernigan?"

06:35.176 --> 06:37.343
Me hope that don't mean
I'm in trouble.

06:37.411 --> 06:39.145
Oh, no, we just want
to talk to you.

06:39.212 --> 06:41.347
- You wanna talk? Talk.
- Are you aware

06:41.415 --> 06:43.416
that Hector Suarez was
gunned down last night?

06:43.483 --> 06:45.584
- Never heard of him.
- He's part of an emerging

06:45.652 --> 06:48.421
Latino gang that's making
inroads in this area.

06:48.488 --> 06:51.324
And what makes you think
me know anything about that?

06:51.391 --> 06:53.758
We just wanna know if
we should expect more violence,

06:53.826 --> 06:55.327
more bodies showing up.

06:55.394 --> 06:58.096
Violence is bad for business.

06:58.164 --> 07:00.798
Even if someone's trying
to take business away from you?

07:00.866 --> 07:03.201
Maybe someone
from Delgado's operation?

07:03.269 --> 07:07.372
Me know nothing
of such an operation.

07:07.440 --> 07:10.341
You're asking me to trust him?
I think you should.

07:10.408 --> 07:13.610
We take care of things
our own way.

07:13.678 --> 07:16.680
And we just wanna make sure that
things don't escalate out of control.

07:16.747 --> 07:19.816
You wanna help me?

07:21.586 --> 07:23.387
Good afternoon.

07:23.455 --> 07:25.321
Ready for something to eat.

07:27.291 --> 07:28.724
Anything?

07:28.792 --> 07:31.560
Yeah. One of Delgado's guys
acting as a go-between,

07:31.628 --> 07:33.496
but it wasn't Hector Suarez.

07:35.732 --> 07:37.800
So, it looks like Jernigan's
still a free man.

07:37.868 --> 07:41.370
Yeah. I didn't get a connection to Suarez's
murder, but he definitely knows Delgado.

07:41.437 --> 07:43.472
I'm getting a sense
that something's in the works.

07:43.539 --> 07:46.875
Metro's been looking into the alibis of all
of Jernigan's closest known associates.

07:46.942 --> 07:49.144
- So far everything checks out.
- Were we able to get

07:49.212 --> 07:51.743
- any prints from the passports?
- Actually, we're in luck.

07:51.863 --> 07:52.929
Even though they were wiped

07:53.049 --> 07:54.983
we were able to get
a partial palm print.

07:55.051 --> 07:57.584
Cross-referencing it
with the new palm print database

07:57.652 --> 07:59.853
didn't turn up anything,
so I thought, let's scan

07:59.921 --> 08:02.056
the files of employees
of Passport Canada.

08:02.124 --> 08:04.925
- I'm sensing a "Bingo".
<i>- Mrs. Hanson...</i>

08:04.993 --> 08:07.895
<i>Natasha.</i>
<i>Hanson is my ex's name.</i>

08:07.962 --> 08:10.181
<i>OK, Natasha. Maybe</i>

08:10.301 --> 08:15.201
you can explain to us how your palm prints
ended up on a bunch of stolen passports.

08:15.269 --> 08:17.937
I, uh, I handle
lots of materials at work.

08:18.005 --> 08:20.440
But these passports were meant
to be destroyed, but they were

08:20.508 --> 08:22.875
forged and they ended up
in the hands of criminals.

08:22.943 --> 08:25.845
Do you know anything
about this?

08:29.849 --> 08:31.483
Maybe you made a mistake.

08:31.551 --> 08:33.452
You weren't trying
to facilitate

08:33.520 --> 08:35.921
the entry of dangerous criminals
into our country.

08:35.988 --> 08:39.457
We should remind you that stealing
passports is a federal offence.

08:39.525 --> 08:41.726
Now, we'll do everything we can

08:41.794 --> 08:44.463
to make sure your children don't
watch their mother go to prison,

08:44.531 --> 08:46.531
but you're gonna have
to help us out here, OK?

08:49.301 --> 08:51.402
He offered me a lot of money.

08:51.470 --> 08:53.337
Who did?

08:53.405 --> 08:55.173
He didn't say his name,

08:55.240 --> 08:58.943
but I remember he had something
on his neck, like a burn mark.

08:59.010 --> 09:02.845
He said they'd be used to help
refugees make a fresh start.

09:02.913 --> 09:05.082
Did you deliver the passports
to this man?

09:05.149 --> 09:06.883
Someone picked them up.

09:11.889 --> 09:15.058
I needed the money.
I thought I was

09:15.126 --> 09:16.826
helping people.

09:16.894 --> 09:20.729
- I can't go to jail.
- Get yourself a lawyer.

09:20.797 --> 09:24.233
- We'll do what we can.
- We've been looking for the wrong guy.

09:27.437 --> 09:29.605
- What about this guy?
- No.

09:29.672 --> 09:31.840
- This guy?
- No.

09:31.908 --> 09:35.343
- How about the earring guy?
- No.

09:35.411 --> 09:39.414
OK, well, if the guy you keep
seeing is Roman's friend,

09:39.482 --> 09:41.474
then he sure doesn't like
being photographed.

09:41.594 --> 09:42.554
Or he's a ghost.

09:42.674 --> 09:43.918
Or he's a ghost.

09:43.986 --> 09:45.420
He is well connected.

09:45.488 --> 09:47.155
So, how do we find him?

09:47.223 --> 09:50.390
Last month the RCMP put a GPS
monitor on Roman's car.

09:50.458 --> 09:53.327
They logged any place he stayed
for a significant amount of time.

09:53.394 --> 09:55.729
Maybe one of these places
can lead us to our ghost.

09:55.796 --> 09:58.132
So, I suppose I've you
to thank for plugging the holes

09:58.199 --> 10:00.100
in Passport Canada's
security breach.

10:00.168 --> 10:03.903
- We'll close the case. Well done.
- Well, not done exactly.

10:03.971 --> 10:07.473
The Central American criminal organization
is scaling things up, which can only mean

10:07.541 --> 10:10.709
- more trouble on the streets.
- The RCMP are aware of these developments.

10:10.777 --> 10:13.579
They're well beyond the scope
of your original assignment.

10:13.647 --> 10:16.215
Which has opened up
into something bigger. You will

10:16.283 --> 10:19.084
be reminded that there is a
discretionary nature to our caseload.

10:19.153 --> 10:21.653
This is a redundant use
of resources, Alvin.

10:21.720 --> 10:24.222
Then we will be
as economical as possible.

10:24.290 --> 10:27.125
Why don't I walk you
through the numbers?

10:29.128 --> 10:32.997
So, where has Delgado been
spending his time?

10:33.065 --> 10:35.267
It all seems very routine
to me...

10:35.334 --> 10:38.469
home, a few fabric warehouses,

10:38.537 --> 10:41.205
tailoring shops. Mostly just
criss-crossing the suburbs.

10:41.273 --> 10:44.508
Chris Jernigan saw him enter
one of those eastside

10:44.576 --> 10:46.911
condo buildings
with a food court.

10:46.979 --> 10:51.182
OK, it looks like he stopped
a bunch of times on Carlaw.

10:57.055 --> 10:59.022
OK, seriously, I'm starving.

10:59.090 --> 11:01.024
I told you, we should
have got something.

11:01.092 --> 11:04.661
I didn't think we were gonna
have to wait around this long.

11:04.729 --> 11:07.397
There he is.

11:07.464 --> 11:09.232
Excuse me.

11:09.300 --> 11:11.266
- Do I know you?
- IIB.

11:11.334 --> 11:13.268
We need to talk to you
about some forged passports.

11:13.336 --> 11:15.671
Found under the body
of Hector Suarez.

11:21.011 --> 11:24.046
- It's him.
- You're gonna have to come with us.

11:24.114 --> 11:26.181
I don't think so.

11:47.881 --> 11:50.048
<i>- So, the shooter got away?</i>
<i>- Yeah, he knew what he was</i>

11:50.116 --> 11:53.051
doing. I took a picture of him.
We canvassed the building,

11:53.171 --> 11:54.866
got an ID.
He goes by Alex Parro.

11:54.986 --> 11:56.887
The neighbours don't know
much. They said that he keeps

11:56.955 --> 11:58.889
to himself,
comes and goes all hours.

11:58.957 --> 12:00.958
So, not exactly
a nine-to-fiver.

12:01.026 --> 12:03.094
And you read it? The shooting?
I did, I did.

12:03.161 --> 12:05.630
Hector reached for his gun,
but Alex beat him to it.

12:05.698 --> 12:08.632
Well, if Hector and his boss
Roman didn't see eye to eye,

12:08.700 --> 12:10.767
maybe Alex did the dirty work
and took Hector out.

12:10.835 --> 12:12.302
Or maybe Roman's in the dark

12:12.370 --> 12:14.705
and Alex is taking out the
internal competition on his own.

12:14.772 --> 12:17.040
Yeah, but what's his play
here, you know? Is he trying

12:17.108 --> 12:20.277
to kill his way to the top
and Hector got in the way?

12:20.345 --> 12:23.580
What about the fiancée? Whatever got
Hector killed could have her in the line

12:23.648 --> 12:25.684
- of fire as well.
- Well, let's see if she's

12:25.850 --> 12:28.351
recovered enough
to ask her a few questions.

12:28.418 --> 12:31.587
Hey, Dev. Where's Gabrielle
Navarro right now?

12:31.655 --> 12:34.257
Uh, let's see.

12:34.324 --> 12:37.660
We have her under surveillance,
so right now...

12:37.728 --> 12:41.263
check the logs...
Yoga class.

12:41.330 --> 12:43.665
- Aligning her chakras.
- All right, Dev, why don't you

12:43.733 --> 12:45.834
go with Toby? I'll check in
with you guys in a while.

12:45.902 --> 12:48.812
Sick. Feels like
I never left this place.

12:55.944 --> 12:58.079
Yeah, it's cool.

13:00.048 --> 13:01.783
All right, it's all yours.

13:05.535 --> 13:06.651
Hey, stranger.

13:06.771 --> 13:09.651
- Hey.
- Klein let you off the chain?

13:09.771 --> 13:11.592
- I have an hour.
- Mm-hmm.

13:11.660 --> 13:14.527
So I brought you
Szechuan noodles. Extra spicy.

13:14.595 --> 13:16.596
- Food!
- Yes.

13:16.664 --> 13:18.131
My favourite.

13:18.199 --> 13:21.534
You guys open already?

13:21.602 --> 13:23.569
Uh, no. That's Gaines.

13:23.637 --> 13:25.806
He, uh, he just needed a...

13:25.873 --> 13:28.607
space to meet
with some associates.

13:28.675 --> 13:31.743
- Gaines, your investor?
- Yeah.

13:31.812 --> 13:34.246
He uses the back room
if it's not booked.

13:34.314 --> 13:35.781
Really?

13:35.849 --> 13:41.086
Really. One of the perks
of being an investor.

13:41.154 --> 13:44.622
He just needs a space to have
some drinks with some people.

13:44.690 --> 13:47.591
It's a little extra money
in our pocket.

13:47.659 --> 13:49.861
And we're gonna need it, right?

13:49.929 --> 13:54.899
Yeah. No, you're right. I just, um... I
guess I'm quick to look for trouble.

13:55.019 --> 13:56.117
That's the thing about trouble.

13:56.237 --> 13:58.669
If you look for it,
you're gonna find it.

14:04.609 --> 14:07.878
- Hey.
- Sorry.

14:07.946 --> 14:10.013
Hey, Gabrielle?

14:10.081 --> 14:12.015
This is my associate,
Corporal Clark. We're just gonna

14:12.083 --> 14:14.017
ask you a few follow-up
questions, if that's OK.

14:14.085 --> 14:16.786
Of course.
Any way I can help.

14:16.854 --> 14:19.055
Thank you. What did you know
about Hector's business?

14:19.122 --> 14:22.826
All I know is Hector was
helping Señor Delgado.

14:22.893 --> 14:26.262
Do you know what he was doing
with Delgado?

14:26.330 --> 14:28.998
Do you want her out?
Don't ask any questions!

14:29.066 --> 14:30.900
Ah!

14:32.836 --> 14:35.504
Hector was very private
about his activities.

14:35.572 --> 14:38.206
What do you know
about Alex Parro?

14:38.274 --> 14:42.344
Alex? He's an associate
of Hector's.

14:42.412 --> 14:44.747
Why do you ask?

14:44.814 --> 14:47.148
- I can help you.
- Well, we just want

14:47.216 --> 14:49.917
to ask Alex a few questions
about Hector's murder.

14:50.485 --> 14:54.421
- Alex didn't kill Hector.
- How can you be so sure of that?

14:54.489 --> 14:55.990
They were friends,

14:56.057 --> 14:58.158
and Alex is not a murderer.
Do you know

14:58.226 --> 14:59.659
where we can find Alex?

14:59.727 --> 15:02.196
I don't even know
where he lives.

15:10.170 --> 15:12.105
OK. Thank you.

15:12.172 --> 15:14.240
I'm gonna freshen up,
if you don't mind.

15:14.308 --> 15:16.342
- Sure.
- OK.

15:20.781 --> 15:23.681
She's been texting Alex.
He texted her something about

15:23.749 --> 15:25.723
"Meeting at our place". Can you
find an address?

15:25.843 --> 15:26.732
Uh. maybe.

15:26.852 --> 15:29.154
There's no password.

15:29.222 --> 15:32.090
This goes back for months.

15:32.158 --> 15:34.159
OK, there's only
one address in here.

15:34.227 --> 15:37.061
- I think I might have got it.
- Let's call it in.

15:37.129 --> 15:38.662
Good work.

15:44.736 --> 15:47.038
All right, B Team.

15:47.105 --> 15:50.341
- Hey.
- Hey. I thought you had plans.

15:50.409 --> 15:52.310
Yeah, I thought you could
use a little help.

15:52.377 --> 15:54.544
All right. A guy
matching Alex's description

15:54.611 --> 15:56.846
checked into room 212.
He hasn't checked out since.

15:56.914 --> 15:58.714
OK. How was yoga?

15:58.782 --> 16:00.917
Gabrielle is trying
to get someone she cares about

16:00.985 --> 16:03.187
into the country, but Hector's
not gonna let that happen

16:03.307 --> 16:04.515
unless she does as she's told.

16:04.635 --> 16:07.457
- Could point to domestic abuse.
- Maybe she took matters

16:07.524 --> 16:10.526
- into her own hands.
- Maybe she has someone doing it for her.

16:10.594 --> 16:12.695
Her and Alex are more
than just acquaintances.

16:12.763 --> 16:15.397
So, this seedy motel,
this is their love nest?

16:15.466 --> 16:17.146
- Yeah. You set?
- Yeah.

16:17.266 --> 16:20.269
All right. McCluskey's here.
We're standing by.

16:20.337 --> 16:22.972
- What's your status?
- <i>A Team is assembled.</i>

16:23.039 --> 16:25.040
<i>B Team is securing
the back escape routes.</i>

16:25.108 --> 16:27.041
OK. Once they're
in position, we move.

16:27.109 --> 16:29.344
Ten- four.

16:29.411 --> 16:31.412
What's all that?

16:31.481 --> 16:35.650
Uh... we have the suspect cornered,
tactical units are on scene.

16:35.718 --> 16:37.694
<i>He's not gonna slip
through our fingers this time.</i>

16:37.814 --> 16:38.968
<i>Alex Parro?</i>

16:39.088 --> 16:41.022
So, you read my report.

16:41.090 --> 16:43.557
I didn't authorize this.

16:43.625 --> 16:45.526
Go off com.

16:45.594 --> 16:47.828
Oh, something's happening.

16:47.896 --> 16:51.098
You've got significant resources
tied up based on what?

16:51.165 --> 16:53.734
Because we know it's him.
And I didn't realize

16:53.802 --> 16:56.336
I needed your permission
on tactical operations.

16:56.404 --> 16:59.105
Where's the evidence, Alvin?
There was nothing in the report.

16:59.172 --> 17:02.174
- Nichola, you have to let us do our jobs.
- Corporal Clark, I'm ordering

17:02.242 --> 17:04.911
this operation terminated.
You tell your operatives.

17:07.915 --> 17:11.183
- Stand by, McCluskey.
- Ten-four. Standing by.

17:11.251 --> 17:14.752
- That didn't sound like a termination.
- Oh, we're not done.

17:23.796 --> 17:25.731
Please enlighten me why you feel
the need to undermine

17:25.798 --> 17:27.933
my authority in the middle
of a tactical operation.

17:28.001 --> 17:31.402
This is not about authority. Look, our
most reliable intelligence indicates

17:31.469 --> 17:33.604
that Suarez was killed
by the Kingston Connection.

17:33.672 --> 17:35.706
Looking elsewhere is a waste
of the department's time

17:35.774 --> 17:37.642
- and resources.
- The Jamaicans had

17:37.709 --> 17:39.644
nothing to do with this.
Metro has investigated

17:39.711 --> 17:42.279
a dozen likely culprits,
and all their alibis check out.

17:42.347 --> 17:44.415
Our instincts on this have been
right all along.

17:44.482 --> 17:46.516
Instincts are one thing,
evidence is another.

17:46.584 --> 17:49.252
Look, I will keep your team
on the case,

17:49.319 --> 17:51.287
but if you have a problem
doing things my way,

17:51.355 --> 17:54.390
I've been given authority
to have you removed.

17:54.458 --> 17:57.093
Well, I do have a problem
with that, Nichola,

17:57.161 --> 17:59.729
and I'd suggest you look
into your marching orders.

17:59.797 --> 18:02.831
Paid suspension
until resolution of the case.

18:12.208 --> 18:13.742
McCluskey.

18:13.810 --> 18:15.945
What's going on? B Team has
spotted him. He's on the move.

18:16.012 --> 18:18.580
- <i>Stand down.</i>
- We're going to lose him.

18:18.647 --> 18:21.215
It's over, Michelle.
Abort the operation.

18:31.060 --> 18:33.227
What the hell just happened?

18:38.836 --> 18:40.510
<i>So, Klein's out?</i>

18:40.630 --> 18:41.587
Yeah, Martell suspended him.

18:41.707 --> 18:43.563
You're kidding.
So it wasn't him who shut us down?

18:43.683 --> 18:47.143
No. They got into it last night, and
I guess he just lost the battle.

18:47.211 --> 18:49.873
He's usually good at managing
Martell and keeping his cool.

18:49.993 --> 18:53.629
Not last night. He was crazy when he left. I
thought he would have called one of you guys.

18:53.749 --> 18:57.319
- No.
- Looks like perfect timing.

18:57.386 --> 19:00.198
- So, how do we start the day?
- Um,

19:00.307 --> 19:02.574
Klein usually brings us in
for a briefing.

19:02.642 --> 19:04.677
Yeah, I thought it would be
best to give him some time off

19:04.744 --> 19:06.757
to recharge. Until then,
you can report to me.

19:06.877 --> 19:07.926
OK, boss.

19:08.046 --> 19:11.683
- So, are we off the Suarez case?
- On the contrary.

19:11.750 --> 19:13.851
You're IIB's most elite unit.

19:13.919 --> 19:17.455
I can't imagine anyone more capable of
bringing Chris Jernigan to justice.

19:17.523 --> 19:21.392
We've been over the files many times; he's
been out of the murder business for years.

19:21.460 --> 19:23.627
Central Americans are
moving in on his turf.

19:23.695 --> 19:26.129
It's the best motive we have,
and you're the best unit

19:26.197 --> 19:29.633
we have, so I'm sure it won't take long for
you to find something on him. And you,

19:29.701 --> 19:31.735
I need you to clean up
the passport file.

19:31.803 --> 19:34.270
All right, well, I think that
just about does our briefing.

19:34.339 --> 19:36.807
- Great.
- Yeah.

19:36.874 --> 19:38.374
Yay.

19:45.482 --> 19:47.516
Hey, Chris,
talk to you a minute?

19:47.584 --> 19:49.918
- "Chris" now, is it?
- Well, you're not in trouble.

19:49.986 --> 19:52.888
We're just curious, you know. People
are saying you killed Hector Suarez.

19:52.956 --> 19:56.991
- Who say this?
- It's the word on the street.

19:57.059 --> 19:59.494
Word on the street give me
too much credit.

20:05.634 --> 20:07.902
Me have no enemies.

20:07.970 --> 20:10.037
- Good day.
- Good day.

20:12.039 --> 20:14.040
All right,
Chris and Delgado have a deal.

20:14.108 --> 20:17.077
So, why is Martell trying to pin
this on the Kingston Connection?

20:17.144 --> 20:19.980
The intel's coming from somewhere.
RCMP must have a source.

20:20.047 --> 20:22.449
- Only one way to find out.
- Yeah.

20:29.356 --> 20:30.790
Corporal Clark.

20:30.858 --> 20:33.426
- I have a forensics update.
- Mm-hmm?

20:33.494 --> 20:35.628
OK, Passport Canada reports

20:35.696 --> 20:38.731
nearly 100 books missing.
It's possible that those have

20:38.799 --> 20:41.534
also been forged with false IDs
for Central American criminals.

20:41.602 --> 20:43.067
Interesting.

20:43.135 --> 20:46.371
Yeah, and the forgeries bear
similar trademarks

20:46.439 --> 20:49.107
to the work of a master forger
who was recently paroled.

20:49.174 --> 20:50.876
Hmm, is that so?

20:50.943 --> 20:53.912
Yeah, I mean, he may be able
to ID some of the criminals

20:53.979 --> 20:56.047
that Suarez has been trying
to get into the country,

20:56.115 --> 20:58.082
so we could stop them
at the border,

20:58.150 --> 21:00.083
or at least tail them
if they're already here.

21:00.151 --> 21:02.586
All right, why don't you
put it in your report?

21:02.654 --> 21:06.524
Excuse me, but I feel like it would
be wise to act quickly on this.

21:06.591 --> 21:10.060
I'll look into it and decide
how to allocate the resources.

21:10.128 --> 21:12.296
OK.

21:12.363 --> 21:14.064
Thank you.

21:16.967 --> 21:20.437
Hello. Well, this would be
a lot easier

21:20.504 --> 21:23.105
if we could just meet you
in the office.

21:23.173 --> 21:26.342
What's wrong with Adam's bar? It
perfect for a secret rendezvous.

21:26.410 --> 21:29.446
I just hope it doesn't get you into
any more trouble with Martell.

21:29.513 --> 21:31.880
Nothing I can't handle.
With Toby's reads

21:31.948 --> 21:34.382
as our only evidence, it was
a battle I wasn't gonna win.

21:34.451 --> 21:36.718
I have faith you guys can
manage without me.

21:36.786 --> 21:38.787
There's a lot
to catch you up on.

21:38.855 --> 21:41.256
Hold on a second. How often do
we all get a day out together?

21:41.324 --> 21:44.092
I'm just gonna go
say hi to Adam.

21:48.363 --> 21:50.264
- Hey.
- Hey, you.

21:50.332 --> 21:52.600
What's that all about?

21:52.668 --> 21:54.569
- What, Gaines?
- Yeah.

21:54.636 --> 21:59.273
- It's nothing.
- I saw you take money from him.

21:59.341 --> 22:01.943
Is that how his investment
works? A few hundred

22:02.010 --> 22:05.612
- trickling in at a time?
- No, of course not.

22:05.680 --> 22:07.948
Well, I see you
pocketing cash, Adam,

22:08.015 --> 22:10.584
it makes me think of one thing.

22:10.651 --> 22:13.620
I'm not gambling, OK?

22:16.056 --> 22:19.091
Look, they are, all right?
He's running a small game

22:19.158 --> 22:21.293
in the back room
for his buddies, that's it.

22:21.361 --> 22:25.063
- I knew it.
- What?

22:25.131 --> 22:28.400
He pays me a little percentage on the side
to look the other way. It's not a big deal.

22:28.468 --> 22:30.536
With your history,
it is a big deal.

22:32.539 --> 22:36.374
I'm not gambling, OK?
And every cent of this

22:36.441 --> 22:40.512
- goes to our future. Our future.
- And what happens if you get busted?

22:40.579 --> 22:42.435
You could lose the club.
You could lose everything.

22:42.555 --> 22:43.729
That's not gonna happen.

22:43.849 --> 22:45.558
And what am I supposed
to tell them?

22:45.678 --> 22:49.053
What, Klein? He likes the game
as much as anybody else.

22:49.121 --> 22:51.421
No one is
getting hurt here, Mich.

22:51.489 --> 22:53.557
And I can't be
second-guessing myself,

22:53.625 --> 22:55.659
looking over my shoulder
for your approval

22:55.727 --> 22:59.262
every time I make a decision,
OK? So please, just let it go.

22:59.330 --> 23:02.799
Wrong answer.

23:06.004 --> 23:08.905
How's Adam?

23:08.972 --> 23:12.341
Fine. Did Toby bring you
up to speed?

23:12.409 --> 23:16.012
Yeah. It appears our murderer
Alex Parro has lofty ambitions

23:16.079 --> 23:18.247
within the local
organized crime scene.

23:18.314 --> 23:22.051
Martell keeps sending us down dead-ends.

23:22.118 --> 23:24.485
Yeah, and sitting on valuable
time-sensitive information.

23:24.554 --> 23:27.188
I don't understand. Is there
something we're not seeing here?

23:27.256 --> 23:29.390
- Has Martell been compromised?
- Why would she send you packing

23:29.458 --> 23:31.729
in the middle of an investigation
on organized crime?

23:31.849 --> 23:34.295
Martell is a lot of things;
corrupt isn't one of them.

23:34.363 --> 23:36.397
She's likely being fed bad intel

23:36.465 --> 23:39.833
from above. It's not exactly
like she has access to

23:39.901 --> 23:43.270
- our primary source of evidence.
- She's gonna be watching us like a hawk.

23:43.337 --> 23:45.706
Then take care
not to raise suspicion.

23:45.774 --> 23:48.542
And due to the seriousness
of this case,

23:48.610 --> 23:52.379
I think you need to use any
and all means at your disposal.

23:52.447 --> 23:55.014
Are you saying you want me
to read one of our own?

23:55.082 --> 23:57.249
Well, we have a policy
against it, but in this case,

23:57.317 --> 24:00.019
intentionally or not, Martell
has you chasing your tails

24:00.087 --> 24:01.788
while Delgado builds an army.

24:01.855 --> 24:04.457
Well, in this case
I will make an exception.

24:06.727 --> 24:09.562
This is interesting.
I have feelers

24:09.630 --> 24:12.163
out at Airport Security.
This is from my contact.

24:12.231 --> 24:15.300
- I thought you were off the clock.
- You know me better than that.

24:15.367 --> 24:17.970
Gabrielle Navarro's
been detained.

24:18.037 --> 24:21.039
She tried to run. Thanks.

24:21.107 --> 24:24.109
I had her flagged for search
and... well, well, well,

24:24.176 --> 24:26.344
a forged passport has turned up
in her luggage.

24:26.412 --> 24:28.679
We can't bring her to the IIB.

24:28.747 --> 24:31.983
Well, I'll have
Airport Security hold on to her.

24:34.987 --> 24:38.522
Let's go. I don't think I can
sit here for another minute.

24:41.326 --> 24:42.926
Thank you.

24:42.994 --> 24:47.764
Why do they keep me here?
I... I've done nothing wrong.

24:47.832 --> 24:50.967
Carrying a forged passport through
customs would refute that.

24:51.035 --> 24:53.536
I missed my flight.
Now they're gonna be so worried.

24:53.604 --> 24:55.905
Who's gonna be worried?

24:55.973 --> 24:58.407
It's time that you started
cooperating with us,

24:58.475 --> 25:00.409
unless you want to be deported,

25:00.477 --> 25:03.212
with little chance of ever
entering the country again.

25:03.280 --> 25:05.214
Who is this?

25:05.282 --> 25:07.216
Is this your mother?

25:07.284 --> 25:09.218
Is she in trouble?

25:09.286 --> 25:10.919
Ah!

25:10.987 --> 25:15.690
You're never
gonna see her again!

25:15.758 --> 25:17.425
Did Hector ever hit you?

25:17.493 --> 25:19.927
Hector had a temper.

25:19.995 --> 25:22.964
He hit me. He...

25:23.032 --> 25:24.732
We met at a club,

25:24.800 --> 25:27.869
and he bought me things,
gave me attention.

25:27.936 --> 25:30.438
After he came here, he got me

25:30.506 --> 25:35.209
a student visa so I could
join him, but my mother was...

25:35.277 --> 25:36.843
She was left behind?

25:36.911 --> 25:40.181
She... she had
health problems,

25:40.248 --> 25:42.249
and Hector promised
to bring her here

25:42.317 --> 25:44.251
and give her the best care
in the world.

25:44.319 --> 25:47.887
- But there was a catch.
- He proposed.

25:47.954 --> 25:50.856
I had no choice.

25:50.924 --> 25:52.625
For a while, we were happy,

25:52.693 --> 25:56.496
but then I told him
I wanted more from life...

25:56.564 --> 25:59.098
go to college,
make new friends,

25:59.166 --> 26:01.100
and he forbid me

26:01.168 --> 26:03.468
to leave his house.

26:03.536 --> 26:06.071
I wanted to end the engagement,
but he made it very clear

26:06.138 --> 26:09.541
that he had powerful friends back
home who could harm my mother.

26:09.609 --> 26:11.276
You were trapped.

26:11.344 --> 26:12.877
I had nowhere to go,

26:12.945 --> 26:15.766
nobody to turn to.
Except for Alex.

26:17.383 --> 26:19.517
I can get you out of this.

26:19.585 --> 26:21.051
I love you.

26:21.119 --> 26:24.522
I love you.

26:24.590 --> 26:27.325
We know
that Alex killed Hector.

26:27.392 --> 26:29.860
No.

26:29.928 --> 26:33.030
- No. That is not possible.
- People are protecting him,

26:33.098 --> 26:34.965
- including you.
- What happens

26:35.033 --> 26:37.434
if Delgado finds out
that you tried to flee?

26:37.501 --> 26:41.137
I mean, I'm sure he has friends in
powerful places back home as well.

26:41.205 --> 26:45.174
Where is Alex?

26:45.243 --> 26:47.744
You need to go home.
Leave the country

26:47.811 --> 26:49.879
before it's too late.
I'll find you there.

26:49.947 --> 26:51.980
I don't know.

26:52.048 --> 26:56.017
Alex, he's not a killer.

26:56.085 --> 26:59.186
He only wanted to help me.

26:59.255 --> 27:01.822
I guess you have to be
careful who you trust, huh?

27:01.890 --> 27:05.059
We're done.

27:05.127 --> 27:07.895
- We'll do what we can, OK?
- Thank you.

27:17.872 --> 27:19.806
I saw Alex telling her

27:19.874 --> 27:21.808
that he'd find her
in her home country.

27:21.876 --> 27:23.810
We're running out of time
to find this guy.

27:23.878 --> 27:25.845
Especially with Martell
breathing down our necks.

27:25.913 --> 27:27.814
Maybe her boss owes Klein
a favour.

27:27.882 --> 27:30.216
That'd be nice.

27:30.284 --> 27:32.217
I have a favour to ask, Walter.

27:32.286 --> 27:34.153
I'm not here to listen
to complaints

27:34.220 --> 27:38.457
about your superior.
I support her decision.

27:38.525 --> 27:42.227
This has nothing to do with issues between
myself and Superintendent Martell.

27:42.296 --> 27:44.797
This is about a murder suspect,
Alex Parro,

27:44.864 --> 27:47.231
the fact that Martell seems
to be acting on orders

27:47.300 --> 27:50.602
to divert our investigations
away from him. So, before

27:50.670 --> 27:53.738
this costs me or anyone
in my department their careers,

27:53.806 --> 27:56.073
I'd like to know
what you're hiding.

27:56.141 --> 28:00.011
<i>Blow our agent's cover?</i>
<i>Snake Head compromised.</i>

28:00.078 --> 28:03.414
Alvin, you know better
than to ask

28:03.481 --> 28:06.317
about operational matters
so far above your pay grade.

28:06.384 --> 28:10.053
And you know better than to think
I'm doing this for the money.

28:10.121 --> 28:11.988
I can't help you.

28:15.092 --> 28:17.461
Lovely day for a walk.

28:23.934 --> 28:26.869
I obviously struck out.
How about you?

28:26.937 --> 28:29.138
I got a homerun or a foul ball,

28:29.206 --> 28:31.948
- depending on how you look at it.
- Really? Do tell.

28:32.068 --> 28:34.843
I think the person who killed Hector
is one of us.

28:41.672 --> 28:43.573
<i>So, Alex Parro</i>

28:43.641 --> 28:45.574
is an undercover
RCMP operative?

28:45.642 --> 28:48.444
He's a part of something
called Operation Snake Head.

28:48.511 --> 28:50.446
But there's no way
an undercover op would be

28:50.513 --> 28:52.614
allowed to continue his mission
if he shot and killed somebody.

28:52.682 --> 28:54.851
Even in extreme circumstances,
like self-defence,

28:54.918 --> 28:57.453
his handlers would
extricate him immediately.

28:57.520 --> 29:00.689
Maybe he's lying to the RCMP. He said
the Kingston Connection killed Suarez.

29:00.757 --> 29:02.924
They think they're getting
reliable information.

29:02.992 --> 29:05.861
So that's where Martell's
so-called intel is coming from.

29:05.928 --> 29:08.897
But he must know who we are and
that we could blow his cover.

29:08.965 --> 29:11.271
That's probably why
he wants to leave the country.

29:11.391 --> 29:15.337
Guys. Boss. Look busy.

29:15.405 --> 29:17.938
- How do we get around Martell?
- Well, we need to prove to her

29:18.006 --> 29:21.003
that Alex is RCMP and that she's
protecting a rogue agent.

29:21.123 --> 29:23.714
- Here she comes.
- Good afternoon, Superintendent.

29:23.834 --> 29:27.181
- So, what's going on?
- We're just working on our briefing.

29:27.249 --> 29:30.317
Last night, Suarez's fiancée
was detained at the airport.

29:30.386 --> 29:32.754
A search turned up
one of our forged passports.

29:32.821 --> 29:35.422
We also spoke
to Chris Jernigan, and he claims

29:35.490 --> 29:38.324
the Kingston Connection had nothing
to do with Suarez's murder.

29:38.393 --> 29:40.460
In fact, Jernigan had a deal
with Roman Delgado,

29:40.528 --> 29:43.597
and it's likely that Suarez had
a problem with it.

29:43.664 --> 29:47.133
We have reason to believe that it
was Alex Parro who took him down,

29:47.201 --> 29:50.302
and we'd like your permission
to use any and all resources

29:50.370 --> 29:53.171
necessary to bring Alex
to justice.

29:55.275 --> 29:57.209
<i>Command isn't telling me</i>
<i>the truth.</i>

29:57.277 --> 29:59.779
I'm afraid at this time
you cannot continue.

30:05.084 --> 30:07.351
She's not being told
the whole story.

30:07.420 --> 30:10.321
Her strings are being pulled
just as much as ours are.

30:10.389 --> 30:14.091
Then I guess I <i>won't</i> be hacking
into the RCMP covert-ops files.

30:14.159 --> 30:16.227
And while you are
<i>not</i> doing that,

30:16.295 --> 30:18.262
we'll try to find
the murder weapon.

30:24.702 --> 30:26.236
Thank you.

30:28.540 --> 30:29.973
Mr. Delgado.

30:30.041 --> 30:31.675
McCluskey.

30:31.743 --> 30:34.812
And Logan.
Back again?

30:34.879 --> 30:37.814
- You doing a sweep?
- No, I'm just having some

30:37.881 --> 30:40.349
technical assistance here.
Gracias.

30:40.417 --> 30:42.452
- That's enough for now.
- You got something to hide?

30:44.621 --> 30:46.956
Offer the deal.
Hector can't stop it.

30:47.023 --> 30:49.559
The Kingston Connection will
accept.

30:49.626 --> 30:53.429
Alex warned me about you, and
you've been harassing him as well.

30:53.496 --> 30:55.396
Well, we believe
that he killed your lieutenant,

30:55.465 --> 30:57.632
- Hector Suarez.
- Lieutenant?

30:57.700 --> 30:59.367
Oh, that's funny.

30:59.435 --> 31:02.637
- I run a business, not an army.
- Oh, that's right,

31:02.705 --> 31:04.606
yes, a textile business.

31:04.674 --> 31:07.408
But let's just say for the sake
of argument that Hector wanted

31:07.477 --> 31:11.211
to go to war with the competition. Maybe
you had Alex take care of that problem.

31:11.279 --> 31:13.914
You know, you can say
what you want,

31:13.982 --> 31:18.418
Alex did not kill Hector.

31:18.487 --> 31:20.621
Look, there's a simple way
to clear this up.

31:20.689 --> 31:23.056
We find Alex's gun,
we check the ballistics,

31:23.124 --> 31:25.092
it doesn't match,
the guy's off the hook.

31:30.798 --> 31:34.000
- You'd be wasting your time.
- If you're so sure about that,

31:34.067 --> 31:36.736
- then why don't you lead us to him?
- Nah, I don't want to make it

31:36.804 --> 31:39.138
- that easy for you.
- Mr. Delgado,

31:39.206 --> 31:41.440
just a little hint would
be great.

31:41.508 --> 31:42.975
<i>Collecting payment...</i>

31:43.042 --> 31:46.712
<i>Yorkdale Tailors.</i>
<i>This is a big city.</i>

31:46.779 --> 31:48.714
So good luck.

31:50.155 --> 31:52.327
It's gonna be like
finding a needle in a haystack.

31:52.447 --> 31:55.153
 That haystack is gonna
be near a tailor shop.

32:04.462 --> 32:07.698
- Dev, are we sure this is the place?
- <i>Yeah, it's a front</i>

32:07.766 --> 32:11.468
for one of Delgado's bagmen. It makes sense
that Alex would be collecting a payment.

32:11.537 --> 32:15.539
- All right, then we'll wait.
- <i>And guys, I hacked the file,</i>

32:15.606 --> 32:20.309
and Alex Parro is none other
than RCMP Agent Ryan Bautista.

32:20.377 --> 32:22.211
<i>OK, it turns out this guy is
one of the...</i>

32:22.279 --> 32:24.614
Well, I was gonna say "Good
guys", but not so much now.

32:24.682 --> 32:28.952
OK, how long before the RCMP
security is on to you?

32:29.020 --> 32:31.451
Hopefully longer than it takes
for you guys to get this guy.

32:31.571 --> 32:32.702
<i>What about Martell?</i>

32:32.822 --> 32:35.424
I've been running passport
forgery interference on her.

32:35.491 --> 32:38.393
It should be at least an hour before
she gets through my boring-ass file.

32:38.461 --> 32:41.496
- Thanks for taking one for the team.
- Again.

32:43.667 --> 32:47.468
Why would an undercover agent make a deal
with rival gangs that he infiltrated?

32:47.536 --> 32:50.738
He brings the two sides
together, acts as a go-between,

32:50.806 --> 32:53.641
then uses the intel to become
stronger than either one of them.

32:53.709 --> 32:56.044
Something doesn't make sense.

32:56.111 --> 32:59.547
- Hey. Toby.
- Yeah.

33:18.231 --> 33:20.232
- Out of the car.
- Come on.

33:24.370 --> 33:26.271
Hands where I can see them.

33:26.339 --> 33:28.474
You have no idea who I am.

33:28.541 --> 33:30.776
Oh, actually yes, we do, agent.

33:33.046 --> 33:34.779
The smoking gun.

33:36.816 --> 33:40.818
Is there anything else
you want to share with us?

33:40.885 --> 33:43.454
Two hundred and fifty K.

33:43.522 --> 33:46.957
Lots more after we make the deal
with the Jamaicans.

33:47.025 --> 33:51.195
If you think I'm gonna talk...
<i>and spoil the surprise...</i>

33:51.263 --> 33:53.498
Well, if forensics matches
that with the bullets used

33:53.565 --> 33:55.799
to kill Hector, you're gonna
have a lot of explaining to do.

33:55.867 --> 33:58.635
All right.

34:01.639 --> 34:03.607
<i>Superintendent Martell.</i>

34:03.674 --> 34:07.344
I'd like to introduce you
to Alex Parro.

34:07.411 --> 34:10.780
- Why did you bring this man in?
- Because we followed your orders

34:10.848 --> 34:13.916
and we found the evidence we needed
to convict Hector Suarez's murderer.

34:13.984 --> 34:16.731
- And this is him?
- Like you said,

34:16.851 --> 34:19.022
we're the most elite unit
in the IIB.

34:19.089 --> 34:21.690
You really didn't know,
did you?

34:21.759 --> 34:23.926
You're being jerked around,
Superintendent.

34:23.994 --> 34:26.562
You've been ordered to protect
a rogue undercover operative,

34:26.630 --> 34:28.597
whose real name is
Ryan Bautista.

34:28.665 --> 34:30.098
Is this true?

34:30.166 --> 34:33.168
Are you RCMP?

34:36.739 --> 34:39.206
Bring him in. Come on.

34:39.275 --> 34:41.643
What the hell is going on here?

34:41.710 --> 34:44.445
I'm being hung out to dry.
I need answers.

34:44.513 --> 34:46.480
Oh, a lot of people are going
to want answers.

34:46.547 --> 34:48.549
I'm gonna have
to call you back.

34:50.485 --> 34:52.085
What are you doing here?

34:52.154 --> 34:56.123
this is my office.
Thank you for cleaning up.

34:56.190 --> 35:01.661
this came from the RCMP
seized-weapons inventory.

35:01.729 --> 35:03.930
It was issued
to Agent Ryan Bautista

35:03.998 --> 35:07.167
for Operation Snake Head.

35:07.234 --> 35:09.468
His fingerprints are gonna be
on that gun,

35:09.536 --> 35:11.938
and forensics are soon gonna
match it with the bullets

35:12.006 --> 35:13.740
that killed Hector Suarez.

35:13.808 --> 35:17.009
He's been lying
to his handlers.

35:17.077 --> 35:19.678
He was seduced by the world
he was meant to expose,

35:19.746 --> 35:21.947
and you've been ordered
to cover it up.

35:22.015 --> 35:24.717
I was told our intel was
airtight.

35:26.853 --> 35:29.654
- I'll get to the bottom of it.
- In the meantime,

35:29.723 --> 35:32.624
I'm gonna need you to let my
unit investigate this our way.

35:32.692 --> 35:37.228
Any resources you need,
just let me know.

35:46.171 --> 35:48.206
You're loving this, aren't you?

35:52.143 --> 35:53.676
Little bit.

35:56.278 --> 35:58.626
Looks like we got a rogue agent
off the streets.

35:58.746 --> 36:00.273
 Is it too early for celebratory drinks?

36:00.582 --> 36:02.583
No, something's been
bothering me.

36:02.651 --> 36:05.520
We know Bautista set up a deal. When
we arrested him, I got something...

36:05.587 --> 36:07.855
that he didn't want
to spoil the surprise.

36:07.923 --> 36:10.023
A surprise? Like what?

36:10.090 --> 36:12.358
I doubt it was flowers.
Let's grill him.

36:12.427 --> 36:14.027
All right.

36:14.094 --> 36:16.930
You have given all
of law enforcement a black eye,

36:16.997 --> 36:20.166
and now you're going down
for murder.

36:20.234 --> 36:22.636
As a cop, you'd better hope
for solitary.

36:25.205 --> 36:27.807
Was it worth it?

36:27.874 --> 36:31.377
You're not finished yet,
are you?

36:31.445 --> 36:35.281
Don't trust Roman.
Gun up, watch your back.

36:35.349 --> 36:38.117
Roman thinks he's making
a deal with Jernigan,

36:38.185 --> 36:39.718
but you've sold him out.

36:39.786 --> 36:42.620
Where the hell are you guys
getting all this crap from, huh?

36:42.688 --> 36:44.722
Hmm?

36:44.790 --> 36:47.292
You think you're smarter
than us, don't you?

36:47.360 --> 36:49.127
You think you've always

36:49.195 --> 36:50.741
been one step ahead,
but you know what?

36:50.861 --> 36:53.865
We've been watching you.
Even when we were told not to,

36:53.933 --> 36:56.435
- we we're watching.
- You trying to start a war?

36:56.502 --> 36:58.036
Get them to kill each other.

36:58.156 --> 37:01.205
Just doing my part to speed up
the judicial process.

37:01.273 --> 37:02.706
A hero,

37:02.774 --> 37:05.609
cleaning up the streets.

37:05.677 --> 37:07.744
Yeah, that's right.

37:07.812 --> 37:09.913
You guys get to go home

37:09.982 --> 37:12.950
every night and forget
about these monsters.

37:13.018 --> 37:14.951
But I gotta live with them
every day.

37:15.019 --> 37:19.255
And you have no idea
what these men are capable of.

37:19.323 --> 37:23.226
And we're not doing enough
to stop them! So, yeah,

37:23.294 --> 37:26.363
if this thing goes sideways,
they all die,

37:26.430 --> 37:29.199
- fantastic.
- Last time

37:29.266 --> 37:31.467
organized crime factions went
to war in this city, there was

37:31.534 --> 37:34.003
a dozen innocent victims
hit in the crossfire.

37:34.070 --> 37:36.105
Yeah, well, sometimes
there's collateral damage.

37:36.172 --> 37:38.740
Five of them were school
children. Is that what you want?

37:38.808 --> 37:40.850
No.

37:40.970 --> 37:45.347
So why are you risking so much?

37:45.415 --> 37:49.283
You've been hiding
something from me, Alex.

37:49.351 --> 37:52.820
Gabrielle. Hector knew
about you and Gabrielle

37:52.888 --> 37:55.089
and he was gonna shoot you.

37:55.157 --> 37:59.093
I did what I had to do.
It was self-defence.

37:59.161 --> 38:02.829
She said the two of you were
planning to escape.

38:05.033 --> 38:07.667
I was undercover.

38:07.735 --> 38:09.969
She was my only light.

38:10.038 --> 38:13.673
She was the only thing
keeping me from going insane.

38:13.741 --> 38:15.748
We were going back
to El Salvador together,

38:15.868 --> 38:17.004
start over.

38:19.533 --> 38:22.281
I had the passports
for her mother forged.

38:22.349 --> 38:25.918
She had nothing to do
with any of this.

38:25.985 --> 38:28.720
Your full confession might
get her off.

38:28.788 --> 38:30.956
Sure.

38:31.024 --> 38:33.392
Anything.

38:33.460 --> 38:35.293
She deserves a better life.

38:35.361 --> 38:38.129
So, what's the surprise?

38:38.197 --> 38:40.498
What are we missing?

38:42.734 --> 38:44.769
Will you let me see her?

38:52.544 --> 38:54.478
I don't know

38:54.546 --> 38:56.913
how you were so certain
about Bautista.

38:59.050 --> 39:01.085
Your team is good.

39:03.388 --> 39:05.422
He made us look bad.

39:09.059 --> 39:10.993
If this had escalated,

39:11.061 --> 39:13.429
I would have worn it.

39:19.236 --> 39:21.937
You know he was going
to kill us both, don't you?

39:28.077 --> 39:29.777
Please forgive me.

39:33.583 --> 39:35.517
Don't wait for me, baby.

39:37.587 --> 39:39.520
Don't wait.

39:39.588 --> 39:41.122
Please.

39:48.696 --> 39:50.598
Hey.

39:50.665 --> 39:52.799
Chris!

39:52.867 --> 39:55.168
Mister D. Come here, man.

39:55.236 --> 39:57.537
Great. Right here.

39:57.605 --> 40:00.740
You ready?

40:12.885 --> 40:15.120
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Hey, is this a joke?

40:15.188 --> 40:17.689
- No, brother.
- Where's my money?

40:25.598 --> 40:27.565
Me no come here to be insulted!

40:27.633 --> 40:29.167
Where's my money?!

40:32.604 --> 40:35.573
<i> Hi, this is Michelle.
Leave a message and I'll get</i>

40:35.641 --> 40:37.408
<i>back to you as soon as I can.</i>

40:37.476 --> 40:39.644
Hey, it's me again.

40:39.711 --> 40:42.112
Are we not gonna talk
about this?

40:42.180 --> 40:44.481
Come on. Just call me.

41:16.012 --> 41:18.479
You OK?

41:21.049 --> 41:23.618
- It's just my arm.
- OK, I'm gonna go.

41:23.686 --> 41:25.687
- No, no, wait for backup.
- There's no time!

42:25.543 --> 42:29.145
Drop it!

42:35.387 --> 42:39.189
No, no, no. Stay with me.

42:39.257 --> 42:42.058
- Stay with me.
- EMS are on their way.

42:58.341 --> 43:00.609
I shot him.

43:00.676 --> 43:02.778
I killed him.

43:02.845 --> 43:05.180
Toby. You did what you had
to do.

43:05.248 --> 43:07.883
Toby? Toby!

43:07.951 --> 43:10.419
Come on. Stay with me.

43:10.486 --> 43:12.954
Toby!
