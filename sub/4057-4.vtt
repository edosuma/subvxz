00:01.016 --> 00:02.363
Previously on Teen Wolf...

00:07.541 --> 00:08.385
It wasn't a werewolf.

00:08.409 --> 00:09.474
Kanima.

00:16.049 --> 00:17.416
You're not dreaming, Tracy.

00:49.983 --> 00:51.183
You going to do a magic trick?

00:52.686 --> 00:55.153
No, but you are.

00:57.023 --> 00:58.868
I only know one trick and
it's with a playing card.

00:58.892 --> 01:01.004
Well, this one involves
a lighter and your hand.

01:01.028 --> 01:02.806
This is sounding less like a
magic trick and more like assault.

01:02.830 --> 01:05.875
It's a little dangerous, yes.

01:05.899 --> 01:07.076
But it's not as bad
as being lit on fire

01:07.100 --> 01:08.711
in a deputy sheriff's car.

01:08.735 --> 01:11.147
Which by the way, you
walked away from unscathed.

01:11.171 --> 01:12.904
Not entirely. I had to
pay for the uniform.

01:15.542 --> 01:16.953
Give me your hand.

01:16.977 --> 01:19.189
I think I've seen something
like this in a movie.

01:19.213 --> 01:20.457
Lawrence of Arabia.

01:20.481 --> 01:21.891
Remind me what the trick was?

01:21.915 --> 01:22.981
Not minding.

01:30.023 --> 01:31.256
Ow, son of a...

01:33.126 --> 01:34.926
You can last longer than that.

01:39.500 --> 01:40.500
This time...

01:41.869 --> 01:43.309
I want you to do
something different.

01:44.505 --> 01:45.670
Don't think about the flame.

01:48.275 --> 01:49.808
Don't think about the heat.

01:54.014 --> 01:55.580
Don't think about it hurting.

01:57.851 --> 01:59.017
Don't even look at it.

02:01.188 --> 02:02.254
Okay.

02:34.555 --> 02:35.598
What? What happened?

02:35.622 --> 02:36.900
Oh, it was too hot.

02:36.924 --> 02:38.201
My thumb was too
close to the flame.

02:38.225 --> 02:39.235
Are you okay?

02:39.259 --> 02:41.059
Yeah, I'm fine.

02:42.162 --> 02:43.162
What about you?

02:48.902 --> 02:49.968
Did it hurt?

02:53.240 --> 02:54.440
When you were looking at me...

02:56.643 --> 02:58.109
Your eyes kind of drifted.

03:00.914 --> 03:02.347
What were you thinking about?

03:05.919 --> 03:07.163
A dream.

03:07.187 --> 03:08.187
What dream?

03:19.866 --> 03:22.612
I've had it here and there
for about six months.

03:22.636 --> 03:24.276
I'm walking in the woods,
carrying a body.

03:25.839 --> 03:27.884
But it's completely burned.

03:27.908 --> 03:30.775
I can't see who it is
or who it was.

03:32.879 --> 03:33.879
Where are you taking it?

03:34.114 --> 03:35.725
A clearing.

03:35.749 --> 03:36.893
There's a huge tree
in the middle of it.

03:36.917 --> 03:38.361
You'd think it was
1,000 years old.

03:38.385 --> 03:39.729
But it's been cut down.

03:39.753 --> 03:40.952
It's just a stump.

03:42.356 --> 03:43.722
It's real.

03:44.891 --> 03:46.091
It's a real tree.

03:47.928 --> 03:49.728
In a real part of Beacon Hills.

03:51.932 --> 03:53.943
It used to be the center of a

03:53.967 --> 03:56.112
grove of trees called a Nemeton.

03:56.136 --> 03:58.247
What's a Nemeton?

03:58.271 --> 04:00.383
A sacred meeting place
for Celtic Druids.

04:00.407 --> 04:02.874
They were scientists and
healers thousands of years ago.

04:03.777 --> 04:05.788
I've never seen this place.

04:05.812 --> 04:07.178
But that's why you're here.

04:08.415 --> 04:09.948
It drew you here.

04:11.051 --> 04:12.917
That's what it does.

04:15.188 --> 04:17.656
It's a beacon for
supernatural creatures.

04:19.059 --> 04:20.892
It might even
make them more powerful.

04:23.664 --> 04:24.664
What else happens?

04:36.710 --> 04:38.688
I put the body down...

04:38.712 --> 04:40.779
I... I lay it down on the
rings of the trees and...

04:41.081 --> 04:42.147
What?

04:45.118 --> 04:46.184
Nothing.

04:46.787 --> 04:47.864
That's it.

04:47.888 --> 04:49.454
That's the end of the dream.

04:53.994 --> 04:55.271
I only know one trick

04:55.295 --> 04:56.828
and it's with a playing card.

06:35.428 --> 06:37.162
Hey! Can someone
let me out of here?

06:37.831 --> 06:38.930
Hey!

06:44.137 --> 06:45.937
Come on, Gabe.
Let me out, come on.

08:13.493 --> 08:14.559
Scott.

08:50.597 --> 08:51.597
Stiles.

08:54.534 --> 08:55.600
Stiles.

08:58.004 --> 08:59.470
Stiles, come on.

09:03.610 --> 09:04.654
Tracy.

09:04.678 --> 09:06.389
Stiles, I'm fine.

09:06.413 --> 09:09.158
Help Tracy. Find Tracy. Go.

09:09.182 --> 09:10.593
It's okay. She's all right.

09:10.617 --> 09:12.016
Come on, Stiles.

09:22.028 --> 09:23.094
It wasn't me.

09:25.532 --> 09:27.410
What the hell happened to her?

09:27.434 --> 09:29.178
There were these people...

09:29.202 --> 09:31.047
They had masks. Um, there...

09:31.071 --> 09:33.249
There were... Three of them.
I think there were three.

09:33.273 --> 09:34.951
What... What are
you talking about?

09:34.975 --> 09:38.187
They were strong, Stiles.

09:38.211 --> 09:40.289
They had a weapon.
Stiles, I didn't do this.

09:40.313 --> 09:42.191
Okay. She's not changing back.

09:42.215 --> 09:43.459
We're going to need
to get her out of here.

09:43.483 --> 09:44.682
What, hey... Absolutely not.

09:45.719 --> 09:47.196
This is a crime scene.

09:47.220 --> 09:48.680
We call the coroner.

09:48.704 --> 09:50.166
I think the coroner
might by very confused

09:50.190 --> 09:52.134
by this girl's
severed reptilian tail.

09:52.158 --> 09:53.569
I don't care... You should.

09:53.593 --> 09:55.471
Unless you're prepared
to hold a press conference

09:55.495 --> 09:58.296
announcing the presence of
supernatural creatures in Beacon Hills.

10:00.734 --> 10:02.066
Dad, he's right.

10:03.203 --> 10:04.747
Maybe at the clinic
we can figure out

10:04.771 --> 10:06.983
how to change her back,
then call the coroner?

10:07.007 --> 10:08.384
There's a line...

10:08.408 --> 10:10.987
There is a line that
we have to draw.

10:11.011 --> 10:13.055
Dad, you've already
crossed it. More than once.

10:13.079 --> 10:14.312
Sheriff, please.

10:14.714 --> 10:15.714
Let me help.

10:17.450 --> 10:19.010
I've dealt with things
like this before.

10:23.023 --> 10:24.288
Just do it fast.

11:06.766 --> 11:08.066
What the hell are you doing?

11:13.673 --> 11:16.441
His condition looks promising.

11:17.544 --> 11:18.584
Wait, what does that mean?

12:07.293 --> 12:08.771
You're going to be okay,
sweetheart.

12:08.795 --> 12:10.473
It's my spleen, I know...

12:10.497 --> 12:12.775
Mom, you can't say
anything about what you saw.

12:12.799 --> 12:15.827
You can't...

12:15.851 --> 12:18.881
All I saw was some lunatic
girl trying to kill everyone.

12:18.905 --> 12:20.605
You're going to be fine.

12:22.509 --> 12:24.175
You can't tell anyone.

12:24.711 --> 12:26.155
You just can't.

12:26.179 --> 12:27.245
You're gonna be fine.

12:29.883 --> 12:31.360
Tracy was buried? In a hole.

12:31.384 --> 12:32.695
Buried alive. Crawled out.

12:32.719 --> 12:34.330
Then we found another hole.

12:34.354 --> 12:35.947
Who was buried in that one?

12:35.971 --> 12:38.131
I don't know, but I think
we're gonna want to find out.

12:43.830 --> 12:45.608
Stiles.

12:45.632 --> 12:47.443
How bad is it?
Could have been worse.

12:47.467 --> 12:50.027
Theo, nice going on that tourniquet.
You probably saved her life.

12:52.472 --> 12:54.450
All right. She's about
to go into surgery.

12:54.474 --> 12:56.719
So it's going to be a while.

12:56.743 --> 12:59.155
Any other supernatural details
that I need to know about

12:59.179 --> 13:01.190
or do we just stitch her up
and hope for the best?

13:01.214 --> 13:02.892
It was the tail.

13:02.916 --> 13:04.326
Yeah, Tracy cut
her with the tail,

13:04.350 --> 13:05.761
if that makes a difference.

13:05.785 --> 13:06.785
Okay.

13:07.854 --> 13:10.454
But it wasn't just Tracy.
There were the others.

13:11.491 --> 13:12.690
The guys in the masks.

13:17.230 --> 13:18.541
Okay.

13:18.565 --> 13:19.875
Can you do a little
countdown for us, Lydia?

13:19.899 --> 13:21.265
Starting with 10?

13:21.568 --> 13:22.600
Ten...

13:23.570 --> 13:24.635
Nine...

13:34.681 --> 13:35.681
Eight...

13:46.426 --> 13:47.792
Seven...

13:49.696 --> 13:50.728
Six...

13:56.769 --> 13:58.302
Five...

14:02.308 --> 14:03.975
Keep counting.

14:05.612 --> 14:06.677
Four...

15:34.500 --> 15:35.766
Sorry to interrupt.

15:41.841 --> 15:44.820
A werewolf with
the talons of an eagle.

15:44.844 --> 15:48.512
Possibly a shape-shifter, known
in eastern mythology as a Garuda.

15:51.884 --> 15:53.529
Tracy's claws.

15:53.553 --> 15:55.586
The unmistakable
claws of a werewolf...

15:57.924 --> 16:00.469
But...

16:00.493 --> 16:04.829
A werewolf who also bears the
venom and the scales of a Kanima.

16:08.601 --> 16:10.012
What do you even call that?

16:10.036 --> 16:12.881
Personally,
I call it terrifying.

16:12.905 --> 16:14.750
But at the moment, I'm
more interested in how Tracy

16:14.774 --> 16:16.418
was able to get across
the mountain ash.

16:16.442 --> 16:18.387
I thought nothing
supernatural can do that.

16:18.411 --> 16:22.424
As did I. So if Tracy was
able to cross the mountain ash

16:22.448 --> 16:24.126
and no one supernatural
can do that...

16:24.150 --> 16:25.527
Tracy's not a supernatural.

16:25.551 --> 16:26.929
Exactly.

16:26.953 --> 16:30.366
If she wasn't born
and she wasn't bitten,

16:30.390 --> 16:31.500
she had to have been made.

16:31.524 --> 16:34.036
Made?

16:34.060 --> 16:38.440
Someone is trying to make supernatural
creatures with non-supernatural means.

16:38.464 --> 16:40.075
And whoever they are,
they're somehow managing

16:40.099 --> 16:43.011
to blur the lines between
science and the supernatural.

16:43.035 --> 16:44.035
But there's more.

16:45.938 --> 16:47.950
Liam said he found another
hole out in the woods.

16:47.974 --> 16:49.818
Burying them could be
part of their process,

16:49.842 --> 16:50.919
a kind of incubation.

16:50.943 --> 16:51.987
What are we supposed to do?

16:52.011 --> 16:54.423
Same thing you've always done.

16:54.447 --> 16:55.613
Protect your friends.

16:56.149 --> 16:57.882
Protect each other.

16:59.786 --> 17:01.419
So, what about
someone like Tracy?

17:02.822 --> 17:03.921
I wish I could tell you.

17:06.425 --> 17:08.771
Hopefully, I'll have more answers
soon. I'll be gone a few days.

17:08.795 --> 17:10.005
You're leaving?

17:10.029 --> 17:11.029
Just a few days.

17:12.098 --> 17:13.564
How scared should we be?

17:17.103 --> 17:20.482
I've lived in the world of
the supernatural a long time.

17:20.506 --> 17:21.704
But I'm still a doctor.

17:22.208 --> 17:24.153
Still a man of science.

17:24.176 --> 17:27.089
Something like this happens,

17:27.113 --> 17:30.626
it rattles the foundation
of everything you believe.

17:30.650 --> 17:33.862
Something like this
shakes you to the core.

17:33.886 --> 17:35.063
Something like what?

17:35.087 --> 17:36.187
The rules...

17:37.924 --> 17:39.223
The rules have changed.

18:01.080 --> 18:03.158
What are you doing here?

18:03.182 --> 18:06.495
Officially, I'm here to gather
eyewitness testimony.

18:06.519 --> 18:08.063
Unofficially, I'm trying to
find something to watch.

18:08.087 --> 18:10.098
But the only thing
that comes in is

18:10.122 --> 18:11.222
this kung fu movie.

18:13.192 --> 18:14.592
You like kung fu movies?

18:15.695 --> 18:17.539
Do you know how to do that?

18:17.563 --> 18:19.708
I know a little jiu-jitsu.

18:19.732 --> 18:22.766
In the army they taught us
CQC, close quarters combat.

18:26.539 --> 18:27.972
Can you teach me?

18:29.642 --> 18:31.687
You want to learn
jiu-jitsu? Hand-to-hand?

18:31.711 --> 18:33.878
I want to learn how to fight.

18:34.914 --> 18:36.247
Can you teach me?

18:37.149 --> 18:38.149
Yeah.

18:38.851 --> 18:40.551
I can teach you.

18:45.758 --> 18:48.170
If 99.9%

18:48.194 --> 18:51.240
of our DNA sequence is
the same as other humans,

18:51.264 --> 18:54.009
what could account for
the missing 0.1% difference?

18:54.033 --> 18:55.033
Theo?

18:56.135 --> 18:57.579
Um, nucleotides.

18:57.603 --> 18:58.869
That's right.

19:00.673 --> 19:02.634
Yes, Kira?

19:02.658 --> 19:04.620
Can there be more than one
species in the same DNA?

19:04.644 --> 19:08.123
No, but there can be multiple
sets of DNA in the same individual.

19:08.147 --> 19:10.125
We call that a chimera.

19:10.149 --> 19:11.882
Anyone know where
that term comes from?

19:13.119 --> 19:15.130
Sydney? Greek mythology.

19:15.154 --> 19:17.799
It's a lion with a goat
coming out of its back

19:17.823 --> 19:19.201
and a tail that ends
in the head of a snake.

19:19.225 --> 19:21.252
That's right, Sydney.

19:21.276 --> 19:23.756
Do you want to read us the full
Wikipedia entry off your phone?

19:25.164 --> 19:27.809
But that does get us into
the next topic of mutation.

19:27.833 --> 19:30.546
As you know from the reading,
DNA is a fragile molecule.

19:30.570 --> 19:31.735
Isn't it, Scott?

19:33.272 --> 19:35.306
Or did you miss last night's
assigned reading?

19:36.142 --> 19:37.219
Kind of.

19:37.243 --> 19:38.742
Kind of or yes?

19:41.080 --> 19:43.574
Mostly yes.

19:43.598 --> 19:46.094
Well, then thank you for
another helpful transition in topic.

19:46.118 --> 19:48.030
Drop forms.

19:48.054 --> 19:52.156
All those now acutely aware that
they do not belong in this class,

19:53.225 --> 19:54.325
you should fill one out.

19:56.796 --> 19:58.195
The rest will be on my desk.

20:27.360 --> 20:29.059
Wait for it.

20:30.730 --> 20:32.007
Well, that's a pretty
convenient time

20:32.031 --> 20:33.275
for a camera malfunction.

20:33.299 --> 20:34.398
Very.

20:36.702 --> 20:39.214
By the way,
isn't this your day off?

20:39.238 --> 20:41.950
I stood there listening to
that kid threaten your life.

20:41.974 --> 20:44.074
I'm not taking time off
until he's caught.

20:45.411 --> 20:46.888
Wherever Donovan is,

20:46.912 --> 20:48.290
I'm pretty sure
that he's running

20:48.314 --> 20:50.659
as far away as possible,

20:50.683 --> 20:52.049
as fast as he can.

21:02.194 --> 21:04.328
You're lucky they're
allowing me to talk to you.

21:05.197 --> 21:07.309
They don't usually do that.

21:07.333 --> 21:10.679
They're not giving me
much time either.

21:10.703 --> 21:12.948
See, these guys, they...

21:12.972 --> 21:14.716
They believe in numbers.

21:14.740 --> 21:16.985
And their results.

21:17.009 --> 21:18.320
They'll weigh the pros and cons

21:18.344 --> 21:20.210
and they'll decide pretty
quickly. Decide what?

21:22.448 --> 21:24.393
Whether or not you die.

21:24.417 --> 21:27.262
By the way, this is
your psych evaluation

21:27.286 --> 21:29.398
for when you applied
to be a sheriff's deputy.

21:29.422 --> 21:31.700
Multiphasic Personality
Inventory.

21:31.724 --> 21:33.135
You know what that is?

21:33.159 --> 21:36.972
It's a test that assesses
abnormal behavior.

21:36.996 --> 21:40.876
It's supposed to be able to tell
when you're lying or being defensive

21:40.900 --> 21:43.111
or if you're a total psycho.

21:43.135 --> 21:45.414
Your results were pretty
disappointing, Donovan.

21:45.438 --> 21:47.771
You scored high on the
Psychopathic Deviate scale.

21:48.708 --> 21:51.720
And that... That's bad.

21:51.744 --> 21:54.278
I'm not even going to get into
your Anger Expression Inventory.

21:55.881 --> 21:58.415
Just this one quote
here at the end.

21:59.985 --> 22:02.052
"Not suitable
for law enforcement."

22:03.723 --> 22:05.233
It sucks, right?

22:05.257 --> 22:07.137
I mean, you never get
to be a cop like your dad.

22:09.095 --> 22:10.375
But it doesn't matter because...

22:12.732 --> 22:14.031
You've got something else now.

22:14.800 --> 22:15.966
Power.

22:16.802 --> 22:18.480
Real power.

22:18.504 --> 22:21.004
Strength, speed,
heightened senses.

22:22.174 --> 22:24.007
So what do you do
with power like that?

22:24.944 --> 22:26.722
I know what you're thinking.

22:26.746 --> 22:28.223
Go after Stilinski.

22:28.247 --> 22:30.247
Break his legs,
cut off his ears...

22:32.251 --> 22:33.283
Pull out his teeth?

22:35.321 --> 22:37.733
Problem is, though,

22:37.757 --> 22:39.868
sooner or later,
physical pain, it's...

22:39.892 --> 22:40.958
It's manageable.

22:42.194 --> 22:45.229
See, real pain
is emotional pain.

22:46.265 --> 22:48.232
That is the kind
of pain that lasts.

22:49.902 --> 22:52.981
And if you want to cause
Stilinski that devastating,

22:53.005 --> 22:55.372
soul-crushing emotional pain...

22:57.076 --> 22:58.408
You don't go after him.

23:00.179 --> 23:01.545
You go after someone he loves.

23:16.862 --> 23:18.806
Did you get in to see Lydia?

23:18.830 --> 23:20.776
No. I tried using my free
period but she's still in the ICU

23:20.800 --> 23:22.344
and no one outside
family is allowed in.

23:22.368 --> 23:23.368
We got one thing.

23:25.504 --> 23:28.016
Anything in here about
half-werewolves, half-Kanimas?

23:28.040 --> 23:30.340
The Chimera. Um, what?

23:31.477 --> 23:33.421
Chimera.

23:33.445 --> 23:35.390
It's a creature made of
incongruous parts.

23:35.414 --> 23:36.792
And if Liam said he
found two burial sites,

23:36.816 --> 23:38.426
it means Tracy's
not the only one.

23:38.450 --> 23:39.861
Who's the second Chimera?

23:39.885 --> 23:41.163
And why would they bury them?

23:41.187 --> 23:42.787
Deaton thinks
it's part of their process.

23:43.222 --> 23:44.288
The people in masks.

23:57.536 --> 23:59.736
Can someone clue me in as to
what's wrong with this kid?

24:00.239 --> 24:01.939
I'm pretty sure it's this.

24:12.218 --> 24:14.062
Can you put your phone
away for five minutes?

24:14.086 --> 24:15.326
Scott can howl if he needs you.

24:17.323 --> 24:18.567
I just feel like I should
be doing something.

24:18.591 --> 24:20.235
You are.

24:20.259 --> 24:21.970
You're my wingman tonight.

24:21.994 --> 24:23.839
And considering the state
of my dating life,

24:23.863 --> 24:25.841
I need a wingman, co-pilot

24:25.865 --> 24:27.142
and a really hot
flight attendant.

24:27.166 --> 24:29.544
I'm definitely not your
hot flight attendant.

24:29.568 --> 24:32.329
Okay, yeah, choices are limited,
but at least here, you can get drunk.

24:38.143 --> 24:39.554
I said I'd let you in. Not him.

24:39.578 --> 24:40.922
You said I could
have a plus one.

24:40.946 --> 24:42.390
I didn't say plus Liam.

24:42.414 --> 24:43.925
I'm his flight attendant.

24:43.949 --> 24:45.427
What? Wingman.

24:45.451 --> 24:47.095
Forget it.
I don't have to go in.

24:47.119 --> 24:48.463
No, you're coming. Okay.

24:48.487 --> 24:50.387
How about me and him...

24:52.191 --> 24:53.257
Plus 50?

24:57.997 --> 24:59.196
Welcome to Sinema.

25:48.247 --> 25:49.947
We don't look old
enough to be here.

25:50.616 --> 25:51.616
Neither does he.

25:55.988 --> 25:57.154
So is this club mixed?

26:00.726 --> 26:02.025
Ish.

26:41.066 --> 26:42.699
Hey. I'm taking off.

26:45.170 --> 26:47.082
Stiles, wake up and go home.

26:47.106 --> 26:48.266
I'll meet you there in a bit.

27:08.193 --> 27:10.605
You remember I have to pay for
these out of my own pocket, right?

27:10.629 --> 27:11.629
Yep.

27:14.600 --> 27:16.077
Yeah, that's great, Phil.

27:16.101 --> 27:18.301
You just stay back there
getting drunk as usual.

27:19.371 --> 27:20.637
Steady as a rock.

27:27.446 --> 27:28.779
I'm never going to make enough.

28:27.773 --> 28:29.818
This way.

28:29.842 --> 28:31.475
He came in about 45 minutes ago.

28:32.544 --> 28:33.904
Melissa. Yeah.

28:33.928 --> 28:35.290
I'm gonna find an anesthesiologist
covering acute pain.

28:35.314 --> 28:36.680
See what you can do. Okay.

28:40.452 --> 28:42.397
Mom, what's happening to him?

28:42.421 --> 28:43.665
It's the pain.
Nothing's working.

28:43.689 --> 28:45.329
We've already pumped
him full of morphine.

28:46.792 --> 28:48.570
Can't they do
anything to help him?

28:48.594 --> 28:50.405
We can put him in
a medically-induced coma.

28:50.429 --> 28:52.629
It's how we help burn
victims deal with the pain.

28:55.300 --> 28:56.600
Let me see if I can help.

29:08.514 --> 29:09.813
Please, make it stop.

29:13.719 --> 29:15.485
Please make it stop.

29:25.597 --> 29:26.663
Scott.

29:28.233 --> 29:29.477
Let go.

29:29.501 --> 29:30.667
Let go of him.

29:38.210 --> 29:39.509
I'm okay.

29:41.280 --> 29:42.712
Let me see it.
Let me see his arm.

29:56.428 --> 29:58.206
Holy... What is that?

29:58.230 --> 29:59.674
The lab says scorpion venom.

29:59.698 --> 30:01.209
Scorpion? I know.

30:01.233 --> 30:02.744
But that's not
the weirdest part.

30:02.768 --> 30:04.512
Because a sting
this bad means that

30:04.536 --> 30:06.503
he should have been
dead 10 hours ago,

30:07.472 --> 30:09.551
and the scorpion that stung him

30:09.575 --> 30:11.208
would have been 10 feet tall.

30:12.511 --> 30:14.004
Please tell me that doesn't mean

30:14.028 --> 30:15.890
there's a giant scorpion
running around Beacon Hills.

30:15.914 --> 30:16.914
Lucas...

30:19.418 --> 30:20.717
It was Lucas.

30:31.363 --> 30:33.374
No, I didn't catch anything.

30:33.398 --> 30:35.710
No one else in here's like us?

30:35.734 --> 30:37.979
I don't know, dude.
Maybe. It's Beacon Hills.

30:38.003 --> 30:39.769
What's the difference?
It felt different.

30:41.573 --> 30:42.884
What do you mean?

30:42.908 --> 30:44.574
It felt off.

30:45.844 --> 30:46.844
It felt wrong.

30:57.256 --> 30:59.601
Hey, uh, do you see that guy?

30:59.625 --> 31:01.502
He keeps looking over here.

31:01.526 --> 31:02.604
- Do you know him?
- Yeah.

31:02.628 --> 31:03.693
That's Lucas.

31:30.022 --> 31:31.532
Hey, Corey,

31:31.556 --> 31:33.568
what Lucas did to you,

31:33.592 --> 31:34.535
he's gonna do it
to someone else,

31:34.559 --> 31:35.670
and it's gonna be much worse.

31:35.694 --> 31:36.894
We need to know what happened.

31:37.663 --> 31:39.529
I don't really know.

31:40.766 --> 31:42.644
He's never been
like that before.

31:42.668 --> 31:43.733
Like what?

31:44.002 --> 31:45.302
Aggressive.

31:47.005 --> 31:50.018
We were taking it slow,
but it wasn't me.

31:50.042 --> 31:52.020
He was the shy one.

31:52.044 --> 31:54.764
Then we're hanging out today and
it's like he was a different person.

31:55.614 --> 31:57.058
Like, different how?

31:57.082 --> 31:58.648
Like, super confident.

32:00.419 --> 32:01.896
We were just kissing

32:01.920 --> 32:04.799
and then I felt this
sharp sting on my arm and...

32:04.823 --> 32:07.969
And then I looked up at him
and I swear his eyes turned black.

32:07.993 --> 32:10.638
You mean totally black?
The whole eye.

32:10.662 --> 32:12.440
But it was only for a second.

32:12.464 --> 32:14.191
And then he said sorry,

32:14.215 --> 32:15.943
that he'll see me at the club
tonight and then he just left.

32:15.967 --> 32:18.346
And then a few minutes later,
I'm in the worst pain of my life.

32:18.370 --> 32:19.769
Hold on, you said club.

32:20.539 --> 32:21.582
What club?

32:21.606 --> 32:22.839
Every Friday night.

32:23.375 --> 32:24.507
Sinema.

32:38.090 --> 32:39.600
Are you kidding me?

32:39.624 --> 32:40.968
Those were $10 each. Sorry.

32:40.992 --> 32:43.604
The bartender isn't just
going to refill them for me.

32:43.628 --> 32:45.673
Uh, okay, um, I've got money.

32:45.697 --> 32:46.996
I've got, um...

32:50.969 --> 32:53.036
$12 and uh...

32:53.939 --> 32:55.071
Change.

32:55.941 --> 32:57.006
You still owe me $200.

33:10.055 --> 33:11.466
Night of the Living Dead.

33:11.490 --> 33:13.034
What? The movie?

33:13.058 --> 33:16.404
Yeah, it's one of the first
classic zombie movies.

33:16.428 --> 33:17.428
Have you never seen it?

33:17.829 --> 33:19.407
Never.

33:19.431 --> 33:20.431
How does it end?

33:21.700 --> 33:22.966
The zombies pretty much win.

33:23.835 --> 33:25.480
All the good guys die.

33:25.504 --> 33:27.904
So, I guess it's better to
be one of the bad guys.

33:30.542 --> 33:31.608
Maybe.

33:34.413 --> 33:35.413
Sometimes.

33:48.827 --> 33:51.172
A kid turning into a
half-scorpion, half-werewolf?

33:51.196 --> 33:52.540
Is there even a myth for that?

33:52.564 --> 33:53.841
Sumerian.

33:53.865 --> 33:55.932
I remember something
about it in the Bestiary.

34:09.114 --> 34:10.146
God, I love you.

34:31.636 --> 34:32.835
Run.

34:36.608 --> 34:37.819
You did it again.

34:37.842 --> 34:39.620
You did something
that changed everything

34:39.643 --> 34:41.956
and you don't even
realize you did it but you did.

34:41.980 --> 34:43.112
I did?

35:19.718 --> 35:20.884
You're a little late!

36:41.199 --> 36:42.298
What is that thing?

37:14.766 --> 37:15.832
Kira!

37:32.083 --> 37:33.083
Is everyone okay?

37:41.826 --> 37:42.870
We need to get him out of here.

37:42.894 --> 37:43.993
Liam, give me a hand.

37:57.809 --> 37:59.387
Why did you do that?

37:59.411 --> 38:02.423
His condition was terminal.

38:02.447 --> 38:03.447
What does that mean?

38:05.016 --> 38:06.115
What does that mean?

38:07.185 --> 38:08.185
Failure.

38:26.104 --> 38:29.424
I'm sure they'll come up with a reasonable
explanation for the stingers in his arms.

38:31.409 --> 38:33.369
I guess it's better than
trying to explain a tail.

38:34.779 --> 38:35.945
Better than the truth?

38:38.216 --> 38:41.150
Maybe. This is the best
that we can do for now.

38:49.394 --> 38:51.072
I should've
done better. I... I...

38:51.096 --> 38:53.129
I should've known that
this was going to happen.

38:54.766 --> 38:57.178
I should've been
able to stop it.

38:57.202 --> 39:01.148
You know, your grandfather used to
have a saying about the word should.

39:01.172 --> 39:04.006
You know what you're doing
when you say should too often?

39:05.110 --> 39:06.809
You're should-ing
all over yourself.

39:10.882 --> 39:12.393
I know that
I can't be the Mom that says

39:12.417 --> 39:14.177
"I don't want you
to do anything about this."

39:16.121 --> 39:18.154
'Cause you're always
going to be involved,

39:19.457 --> 39:22.937
because not only do you
have the power to do something,

39:22.961 --> 39:24.894
you care enough to do it.

39:27.198 --> 39:30.211
So all you really need
is to ask yourself,

39:30.235 --> 39:31.801
"What am I going to do?"

39:37.909 --> 39:39.375
I'm going to
find out who did this.

39:40.979 --> 39:43.012
And I'm going to stop them.
