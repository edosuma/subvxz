00:26.260 --> 00:27.493
Here you go.

00:27.495 --> 00:29.461
Thanks.

00:34.502 --> 00:37.603
It's up to 26 mil this week.

00:37.605 --> 00:39.438
They're selling
10,000 tickets a minute

00:39.440 --> 00:42.441
and today, Isaac picks
to oversleep.

00:45.212 --> 00:46.612
You forgot the milk.

00:46.614 --> 00:48.380
Yeah, yeah.

00:48.382 --> 00:50.416
Look at that, will you?

00:53.087 --> 00:55.587
You know, Isaac's never been
this late.

01:33.194 --> 01:35.461
POLICEMAN:
They should have never traded
this guy.

01:35.463 --> 01:37.596
He damn near led the league
last year in Philly.

01:37.598 --> 01:39.198
He couldn't hit
lefties in Shea.

01:39.200 --> 01:40.532
Look, I'm gonna
go check this out.

01:40.534 --> 01:41.700
Maybe Isaac's in there.

01:41.702 --> 01:44.636
He just forgot to turn
on the lights.

01:58.119 --> 01:59.518
Jimmy!

02:09.130 --> 02:11.430
Corner of 12th and Elizabeth!

02:11.432 --> 02:13.699
We got an EMU--
we need an EMU here immediately!

03:44.391 --> 03:45.557
Forced?

03:45.559 --> 03:46.625
Nope.

03:46.627 --> 03:49.328
Anyone coming in or going out?

03:49.330 --> 03:51.330
Not through
the front door, no.

03:51.332 --> 03:52.564
How close
were you looking?

03:52.566 --> 03:54.466
We were waiting right
outside for him to open.

03:54.468 --> 03:55.734
The place was
locked up.

03:55.736 --> 03:58.270
Cash register's clean.

03:58.272 --> 04:01.607
His name's Isaac--
Solnik, Skolnik...

04:01.609 --> 04:03.609
Real nice guy-- Russian.

04:03.611 --> 04:05.744
Hell of a "Welcome to America."

04:07.514 --> 04:10.616
CORONER:
<i> He's got acute subdural</i>
<i> hematoma.</i>

04:10.618 --> 04:12.351
That's, uh, bleeding
around the brain.

04:12.353 --> 04:13.752
The pressure
gets built up.

04:13.754 --> 04:15.254
Fatal?

04:15.256 --> 04:16.755
Eh, five to two against.

04:16.757 --> 04:19.524
Then again,
I bet heavy on Oakland.

04:19.526 --> 04:22.694
We'll have to drill holes
to make sure it doesn't go pop.

04:22.696 --> 04:25.430
When will Mr. Skolnik
be able to talk to us?

04:25.432 --> 04:27.332
Couple or three days,
if we're lucky.

04:27.334 --> 04:29.368
I'm doing
another CAT scan this afternoon.

04:29.370 --> 04:30.636
If we're unlucky?

04:30.638 --> 04:33.239
Intercranial damage--

04:33.240 --> 04:35.841
brain edema,
spastic hemiplegia... never.

04:37.911 --> 04:40.379
MAN:
<i> Joey, hand me that bundle.</i>
<i> I'm short one.</i>

04:40.381 --> 04:41.780
Every morning around 5:30.

04:41.782 --> 04:43.282
What about
this morning?

04:43.284 --> 04:44.383
Same as usual.

04:44.385 --> 04:45.617
I don't even know the guy.

04:45.619 --> 04:47.519
I mean, he's still closed
when I get there

04:47.521 --> 04:49.221
in the morning,
you know?

04:49.222 --> 04:50.922
I leave the papers out
front--<i> que sera, sera.</i>

04:50.924 --> 04:53.525
Did you see anything unusual in
the neighborhood this morning?

04:53.527 --> 04:55.294
It's Greenwich Village, man.

04:55.296 --> 04:56.561
You tell me.

04:56.563 --> 04:58.330
Like junkies, for instance?

04:58.332 --> 04:59.898
No, no, they're
over on Tenth.

04:59.900 --> 05:02.467
I toss those papers
and I haul ass.

05:02.469 --> 05:05.671
You know, come to think of it,
there's usually this weirdo

05:05.673 --> 05:07.406
hanging out
outside the store.

05:07.408 --> 05:08.540
Sleeps on the
subway grating,

05:08.542 --> 05:09.908
over on the corner,
you know?

05:09.910 --> 05:11.943
Real scuzzy,
know what I mean?

05:11.945 --> 05:14.229
And Loony Tunes, man!

05:14.230 --> 05:16.514
Wears this ripped-up army jacket
with a blue watch cap.

05:16.517 --> 05:18.450
Looks like he's stoned
all the time.

05:21.822 --> 05:24.690
There is no fire like passion.

05:24.692 --> 05:27.459
There is no shark like hatred.

05:27.461 --> 05:30.595
There is no snare like folly.

05:30.597 --> 05:33.598
There is no torrent like greed.

05:33.600 --> 05:37.469
Look, Mr. Hoover, you had
112 bucks in your pocket.

05:37.471 --> 05:38.637
Now, either business
was real good

05:38.639 --> 05:41.573
or you did something
real nasty.

05:41.575 --> 05:43.342
Sergeant Greevey?

05:43.344 --> 05:44.576
Yeah?

05:44.578 --> 05:46.845
Meg Hennessey,
Homeless Defense League.

05:46.847 --> 05:48.980
I'm sure you read Mr. Hoover
his rights.

05:48.982 --> 05:50.649
Mr. Hoover's not
under arrest.

05:50.651 --> 05:54.353
He willingly agreed to help us
with our investigation.

05:54.355 --> 05:56.588
From now on, keep quiet, Edgar.

05:56.590 --> 05:57.589
Edgar Hoover.

05:57.591 --> 05:59.858
My client
has spent six years

05:59.860 --> 06:01.526
in an institution.

06:01.528 --> 06:02.694
Oh, well, he's cured.

06:02.696 --> 06:04.596
There is no way
he could be

06:04.598 --> 06:05.630
charged with any crime,

06:05.632 --> 06:07.466
let alone serve any time.

06:07.468 --> 06:08.934
I'm sure you gentlemen
are familiar

06:08.936 --> 06:10.469
with the word "incompetent"?

06:10.471 --> 06:11.770
Yeah, well, from where I sit,

06:11.772 --> 06:15.407
he's competent enough
to do 3 1/3 to ten years.

06:15.409 --> 06:16.742
Isaac was a capitalist.

06:16.744 --> 06:18.710
What?

06:18.712 --> 06:21.580
But he couldn't help himself.
He had a good heart.

06:21.582 --> 06:22.647
He gave me cigarettes.

06:22.649 --> 06:23.749
And 112 bucks?

06:23.751 --> 06:25.016
Don't answer
that, Edgar.

06:25.018 --> 06:28.453
Ah, men have done time for less,
Miss Hennessey.

06:28.455 --> 06:29.821
He was already down.

06:29.823 --> 06:31.757
And you helped yourself
to the money?

06:31.759 --> 06:34.659
Fast-forward, Hoover.

06:34.661 --> 06:36.661
I've seen this before.

06:36.663 --> 06:38.463
Look.

06:38.465 --> 06:40.465
Look at him.

06:40.467 --> 06:42.734
Look at me.

06:42.735 --> 06:45.002
Isaac had six inches
and 60 pounds on me.

06:45.005 --> 06:47.839
If I tried anything, I'd be the
one with tubes up my nose.

06:49.042 --> 06:52.711
I saw a guy come out the back
in the alley.

06:55.582 --> 06:58.517
Mean-looking, fancy suit.

06:58.519 --> 07:01.453
Like Donald Trump.

07:01.455 --> 07:02.921
Could you recognize him?

07:02.923 --> 07:04.956
His face is etched right here.

07:04.958 --> 07:07.025
Let me ask you something.

07:07.027 --> 07:11.029
If you liked Isaac so much,
why'd you clean his register?

07:11.031 --> 07:14.800
Didn't look like he was going
to need it.

07:14.802 --> 07:18.503
So, all we got is the wacko?

07:18.505 --> 07:21.706
Our guy lets the perp in.

07:21.708 --> 07:24.009
He does his business

07:24.011 --> 07:25.811
without even peeking
into the register.

07:25.813 --> 07:28.647
Well, maybe he was a rookie.
Maybe he forgot.

07:28.649 --> 07:31.016
Maybe he was after
something else.

07:31.018 --> 07:32.484
And maybe he wasn't, Max.

07:32.486 --> 07:34.153
This is New York, remember?

07:34.154 --> 07:35.821
Sometimes, people get beat up
just for the hell of it.

07:35.823 --> 07:37.622
Sometimes, they even get dead.

07:37.624 --> 07:40.025
It's a fact of life.
It's not always
a conspiracy.

07:40.027 --> 07:41.693
All I'm saying is that..

07:41.695 --> 07:42.894
I just got a nibble.

07:42.896 --> 07:44.496
Guy named Ahkbar.

07:44.498 --> 07:45.730
He's an Indian.

07:45.732 --> 07:47.833
Owned a candy store
down on 14th.

07:47.835 --> 07:50.802
Two months ago,
he's beat to a pulp.

07:50.804 --> 07:53.572
Get this--
no robbery,

07:53.574 --> 07:55.974
no witnesses, no arrests.

07:55.976 --> 07:59.478
Okay, once,
it's part of the freak show.

07:59.480 --> 08:01.947
Twice, maybe
it's a little more organized.

Go talk to the Indian.

08:14.795 --> 08:17.762
Yeah, well, we're a little late.

08:17.764 --> 08:21.700
He wasn't as lucky as Isaac.

Dr. Nash to orthopaedics.

08:24.872 --> 08:27.539
Dr. Nash to orthopaedics.

08:29.776 --> 08:33.912
Is it true
that most robberies go unsolved?

08:33.914 --> 08:38.750
Well, uh, we don't think
this was a robbery.

08:38.752 --> 08:41.753

have any enemies?

08:41.755 --> 08:46.024
He works, he sleeps...

08:46.026 --> 08:48.760
on the holidays
he goes to shul.

08:48.762 --> 08:52.931
Since my mother died,
he's kept very much to himself.

08:52.933 --> 08:55.700
Does he gamble?

08:55.702 --> 08:58.169
No, never.

08:58.171 --> 08:59.905
Borrow money?

08:59.907 --> 09:01.773
Why would he borrow?

09:01.775 --> 09:04.709
He makes $75,000 a year

09:10.551 --> 09:12.717
what you're getting at,
Detective.

09:12.719 --> 09:15.654
This was not
an isolated incident.

09:15.656 --> 09:19.057
My father never broke the law
in his life.

09:19.059 --> 09:21.626
Maybe he ruffled
somebody's feathers.

09:21.628 --> 09:24.796
We would just like to get on
with our lives.

09:24.798 --> 09:27.832
Why would we put ourselves

09:27.834 --> 09:30.735
Well, it looks to me like
you're already in jeopardy.

09:30.737 --> 09:33.772
You don't want to go
through this again, do you?

09:38.812 --> 09:41.680
Two weeks ago,
I was at the store.

09:41.682 --> 09:42.948
I answered the phone.

09:42.950 --> 09:47.719
It was a man
by the name of Pilefsky.

09:47.721 --> 09:50.622
My father made me hang up.

09:50.624 --> 09:52.724
You know what it was about?

09:52.726 --> 09:55.727
No, he wouldn't say,

09:55.729 --> 10:00.799
but he warned me
never to say anything to anyone.

You think Edgar

10:33.767 --> 10:36.167
Depends on what planet
he's on today.

10:36.169 --> 10:37.902
I don't think he'd
recognize himself,

10:37.904 --> 10:39.738
if he looked
in the mirror.

10:39.740 --> 10:42.741

No way.

11:14.241 --> 11:17.142
I'm sure somebody
can confirm that.

11:17.144 --> 11:19.711
Yeah, but I never got her name.

11:19.713 --> 11:21.780

11:24.017 --> 11:25.884

11:30.724 --> 11:34.693
No secrets, gentlemen.

11:34.695 --> 11:37.128
There's got to be something more

11:37.130 --> 11:39.064
A guy that wears $1,200 suits

11:39.066 --> 11:42.801
doesn't do a number

11:42.803 --> 11:44.235
Joe Pilefsky stinks.

11:44.237 --> 11:46.204
Somebody, somewhere,
ordered this.

11:46.206 --> 11:48.907
Whoa, Mike-- the stink test
doesn't wash with a jury.

11:48.909 --> 11:51.176
We'd be lucky to
convict on assault.

11:51.178 --> 11:53.111
Hey, Pilefsky's mobbed up.
We all know it.

11:53.113 --> 11:56.047
I say let's give it a spin,
see where it lands.

cellmates.

Fine! Great!

12:01.321 --> 12:03.855
Be my guest--
but when the wheel stops,

12:03.857 --> 12:06.224
my guess is we're going to be
back where we were yesterday--

12:06.226 --> 12:09.027
a witness who, on a great day,
belongs in a rubber room.

12:09.029 --> 12:11.229
In other words, we got zip,
bubkes, zero!

12:11.231 --> 12:12.230
(<i> phone rings</i> )

12:12.232 --> 12:14.299
What?

12:19.206 --> 12:21.740
Less than zero.

12:21.742 --> 12:23.842
WOMAN:
<i> I looked in-- Hoover's dead</i>
<i> as a doornail.</i>

12:23.844 --> 12:25.744
LOGAN:
<i> Why'd you look?</i>

12:25.746 --> 12:27.746
TV was playing
all night.

12:27.748 --> 12:31.182
The guy in 212 was complaining
about the noise.

12:44.865 --> 12:46.397
Check-out was noon.

12:46.399 --> 12:49.267
Somebody's got
to pay for today.

12:55.842 --> 12:58.843
He lives for ten years
on the street, eating garbage.

12:58.845 --> 13:02.347
We give him a meal and a bed,
and a day later, he's dead.

13:02.349 --> 13:04.215
You sure it was
the booze?

13:04.217 --> 13:07.118
He had a smile
on his face.

13:07.120 --> 13:09.954
A pig in poop.

13:09.956 --> 13:12.390
Well, it's bad timing.
Screws the pooch
on Pilefsky.

13:12.392 --> 13:15.827
Nobody knows about Hoover.
Nobody has to.

13:15.829 --> 13:18.229
Let me hold on to Pilefsky
for a couple of days,

13:18.231 --> 13:19.798
at least
until Isaac can talk.

13:19.800 --> 13:20.899
We've got a
constitution, Max.

13:20.901 --> 13:22.267
News flash!

13:22.269 --> 13:24.069
Pilefsky's

13:24.070 --> 13:25.870
co-defendant on
the federal extortion rap

13:25.872 --> 13:28.072
was a wise guy
named Mario Zalta.

13:28.074 --> 13:29.174
Masucci family?

13:29.176 --> 13:30.942
What would
the Mob want

13:30.944 --> 13:33.812
with a guy
who sells newspapers?

13:33.814 --> 13:35.313
They want to keep up
on current events.

13:35.315 --> 13:38.850
Yeah, well, it seems like Zalta
is a real choirboy now.

13:38.852 --> 13:42.220
He's got an import-export
business, down near the river.

13:42.222 --> 13:46.191
Well, I'm sure he wouldn't mind
answering a few questions.

13:46.193 --> 13:48.126
We don't need to go
headhunting here, Max.

13:48.128 --> 13:50.929
Cutting off a couple of toes
would make me very happy.

13:50.931 --> 13:52.831
Meaning?

13:52.833 --> 13:54.966
Meaning Pilefsky first.

13:54.968 --> 13:57.101
Anyone else is gravy.

13:58.038 --> 14:00.071
LOGAN:
<i> How's this sound?</i>

14:00.073 --> 14:01.072
<i> Pilefsky, Zalta.</i>

14:01.074 --> 14:03.107
Zalta, Masucci.

14:03.109 --> 14:04.943
But that's like,
you know...

14:04.945 --> 14:07.078
you know, uh,
past tense.

14:07.080 --> 14:10.882
Yeah. You don't associate
with Mr. Masucci anymore, huh?

14:10.884 --> 14:12.250
Hey.

14:12.252 --> 14:17.121
Honesty is the best policy, hmm?

14:17.123 --> 14:19.290
Also, it's
a lot safer.

14:19.292 --> 14:20.892
Think about it.

14:20.894 --> 14:22.894
What would Frank Masucci want

14:22.896 --> 14:25.864
with some old Russian
candy store owner?

14:25.866 --> 14:28.199
Protection?

14:28.201 --> 14:31.336
He's been watching
too many old flicks here.

14:31.338 --> 14:34.439
This isn't Chicago
in the '20s over here, eh?

14:34.441 --> 14:37.108
I forgot--
the Mafia doesn't exist.

14:37.110 --> 14:39.410
What about
Joe Pilefsky?

14:39.412 --> 14:41.379
He's just dumb muscle.

14:41.381 --> 14:44.315
He probably just got mad
because your Russian

14:44.317 --> 14:46.451
sold him a bad
Lotto ticket.

14:46.453 --> 14:50.121
People don't end up in ICU
over a Lotto ticket.

14:50.123 --> 14:52.390
This is New York.

14:52.392 --> 14:54.425
Go figure.

14:56.429 --> 14:58.296
(<i> Greevey sighs</i> )

15:00.967 --> 15:04.168
It could be anything--
drugs, weapons...

15:04.170 --> 15:06.471
Masucci's diversified.

15:08.975 --> 15:11.242
How about I check
the back?

15:11.244 --> 15:13.194
Looks good.

15:13.195 --> 15:15.145
My old lady says
I should eat more salad.

15:15.148 --> 15:16.347
I figure
what's the point?

15:16.349 --> 15:18.549
I live
a couple more years.

15:18.551 --> 15:20.451
Only to eat
more salad, huh?

15:20.453 --> 15:21.452
You got it, man.

15:21.454 --> 15:23.221
What's in
the boxes?

15:23.223 --> 15:26.090
Garbage-- he calls it art.
I wouldn't even give you

15:26.092 --> 15:28.059
ten cents
for any of it.

15:28.061 --> 15:30.161
Is that all that
comes through here?

15:30.163 --> 15:32.080
Are you kidding?

15:32.081 --> 15:33.998
Everything from screwdrivers
to kiwi berries.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.301
Zalta's not what
you call a specialist.

15:36.303 --> 15:38.804
Anything else?

15:38.805 --> 15:41.306
Look, man, you know
how hard it is to get work?

15:41.308 --> 15:44.242
I keep my eyes closed,
I keep my job.

15:44.244 --> 15:46.044
What about
your ears?

15:46.046 --> 15:47.545
Sure, I hear stuff.

15:47.547 --> 15:49.447
What kind of stuff?

15:49.449 --> 15:52.450
Like guys that talk
don't talk for very long.

15:52.452 --> 15:55.486
Look, I seen
<i> Godfather I, II,</i> and<i> III.</i>

15:55.488 --> 15:57.188
That's Hollywood.

15:57.190 --> 16:00.158
Look, I hear
Zalta's connected.

16:00.160 --> 16:01.192
To whom?

16:01.194 --> 16:03.561
Guys whose names end in vowels,

16:03.563 --> 16:06.064
and I don't mean Shapiro.

16:06.066 --> 16:09.267
Really, man,
I don't know nothing.

16:16.242 --> 16:17.508
Smoke?

16:17.510 --> 16:19.110
You don't smoke.

16:19.112 --> 16:20.378
Check it out.

16:23.350 --> 16:25.550
No tax stamp.

16:28.088 --> 16:31.456
They're bootlegging
cigarettes.

16:31.458 --> 16:34.392
But you didn't have a warrant.

16:34.394 --> 16:36.995
I had a hunch.

16:36.997 --> 16:38.529
He had a hunch.

16:38.531 --> 16:42.467
Well,
I'm really glad for you, Mike,

16:42.469 --> 16:44.235
but it's not probable cause.

16:44.237 --> 16:46.104
Ergo,
it was an illegal search.

16:46.106 --> 16:47.405
Ergo, the cigarettes
are not admissible.

16:47.407 --> 16:48.506
Ergo, we got squat!

16:48.508 --> 16:50.475
At least we know
their motive.

16:50.477 --> 16:52.577
Oh, I know I'm going
to sleep better.

16:52.579 --> 16:54.512
250 million packs
of cigarettes

16:54.514 --> 16:57.048
are sold every year
in this city.

16:57.050 --> 16:58.649
State and city taxes
come to what?

16:58.651 --> 17:01.319
35 cents a pack?
This is big business.

17:01.321 --> 17:03.421
Isaac was about
to get in their way.

17:09.462 --> 17:12.530
Get me some probable cause.

17:13.500 --> 17:17.135
Max, listen to this.

17:17.137 --> 17:18.603
Zalta's warehouse is owned

17:18.605 --> 17:20.538
by a Meridian
Property Management.

17:20.540 --> 17:22.440
It's a DBA for a guy
named Harv Beigel.

17:22.442 --> 17:25.043
Is that supposed to ring a bell?

17:25.045 --> 17:27.145
Not unless you read Page Six.

17:27.147 --> 17:29.314
I checked him out.

17:29.315 --> 17:31.482
Four years ago, Beigel
married Katherine Masucci,

17:31.484 --> 17:33.901
Frank's sister.

17:33.902 --> 17:36.319
Zalta's a<i> capo </i>
in the Masucci family.

17:36.322 --> 17:38.723
Now, you don't think

17:38.724 --> 17:41.125
that the don would hire
his own brother-in-law

17:41.127 --> 17:44.162
to work in the family
business, do you?

17:44.164 --> 17:46.097
I love this job.

17:52.305 --> 17:54.672
You guys want something
on Frank Masucci?

17:54.674 --> 17:57.108
You're coming
to the wrong guy.

17:57.110 --> 17:58.676
I'm into real estate, period.

17:58.678 --> 18:00.511
Mr. Beigel,
why don't you just tell us

18:00.513 --> 18:02.180
about your warehouse on 23rd?

18:02.182 --> 18:03.314
Do you want it?

18:03.316 --> 18:04.549
The real estate taxes
are killing me,

18:04.551 --> 18:07.185
not to mention
the interest payments.

18:07.187 --> 18:08.719
What can you tell us
about the lessee?

18:08.721 --> 18:11.556
I haven't dealt with tenants in
years-- nothing but headaches.

18:11.558 --> 18:13.357
Gotta talk with
my managing agent.

18:14.327 --> 18:17.428
Ask for, uh...

18:17.430 --> 18:18.529
Lichtenstein.

18:18.531 --> 18:21.232
He handles my
commercial buildings.

18:21.234 --> 18:24.469
Look, let me just refresh your
memory a little, all right?

18:24.471 --> 18:26.237
Your tenant, Mr. Zalta,

18:26.239 --> 18:29.540
and your brother-in-law,
Mr. Masucci, are like this.

18:30.743 --> 18:34.612
Five years ago, I was in Saks,
shopping for ties.

18:34.614 --> 18:37.482
I couldn't decide
between the Adolpho

18:37.484 --> 18:39.217
and the Hermes.

18:39.219 --> 18:43.554
Those long curls and eyes
helped me decide.

18:43.556 --> 18:45.723
Four years ago,
I married her.

18:45.725 --> 18:47.525
And you didn't know
she was Masucci's sister?

18:47.527 --> 18:48.626
I didn't care.

18:48.628 --> 18:51.262
I married the girl,
not her family.

18:51.264 --> 18:53.297
Matrimony is not a crime.

18:53.299 --> 18:56.601
Then it's just a coincidence
that you rent to Zalta.

18:56.603 --> 19:00.505
I own three office buildings,
two apartment houses,

19:00.507 --> 19:03.374
five parking lots
and six warehouses.

19:03.376 --> 19:05.676
You can't expect me
to be familiar with
all of my tenants.

19:07.547 --> 19:08.513
Hey, uh, by the way,

19:08.515 --> 19:10.481
which tie did you buy?

19:10.483 --> 19:11.482
Both.

19:11.484 --> 19:13.551
If you'll excuse me.

19:14.521 --> 19:17.688
I remember
when this cost a nickel.

19:17.690 --> 19:20.525
Yeah, when you used
to walk barefoot

19:20.527 --> 19:23.327
12 miles through the
snow to school, right?

19:23.329 --> 19:24.462
Two hours, Max.

19:24.464 --> 19:26.697
All we got to do
is find one guy

19:26.699 --> 19:29.267
who's selling
the bootleg cigarettes.

19:29.269 --> 19:30.568
Yeah, then convince
him to talk.

19:30.570 --> 19:32.370
If it is the mob, it
ain't going to be easy.

19:32.372 --> 19:34.405
You know how many places
sell cigarettes?

19:34.407 --> 19:35.673
You got a better idea?

19:35.675 --> 19:37.341
All this to get
probable cause

19:37.343 --> 19:38.676
to find out what
we already know.

19:38.678 --> 19:41.546
Send your complaints
to the supreme court.

19:45.552 --> 19:48.519
Let me have a pack of those...

19:48.521 --> 19:50.588
pack of those...

19:50.590 --> 19:53.491
pack of those.

19:53.493 --> 19:55.593
$6.75.

19:57.430 --> 19:59.463
You're closed
for the day, pal.

19:59.465 --> 20:02.333
GREEVEY:
<i> There's a guy</i>
<i> in Saint Vincent's</i>

20:02.335 --> 20:06.437
with holes drilled in his skull
to relieve the pressure

20:06.439 --> 20:09.240
caused by bleeding
around his brain.

20:09.242 --> 20:11.442
What's that got
to do with me?

20:11.444 --> 20:13.678
He was sent there by Pilefsky.

20:13.680 --> 20:16.380
I never heard of him.

20:16.382 --> 20:18.449
(<i> Greevey sighs</i> )

20:20.587 --> 20:25.389
Think the DA will call
Mr. Spivak a co-conspirator?

20:25.391 --> 20:26.757
Maybe.

20:26.759 --> 20:29.560
But selling
of stolen goods, tax fraud.

20:29.562 --> 20:31.596
We're talking
three years minimum.

20:31.598 --> 20:34.532
Look, I'm just trying
to make a buck.

20:34.534 --> 20:36.400
The rent on my place

20:36.402 --> 20:39.303
has doubled
over the last couple of years.

20:39.305 --> 20:40.605
A guy comes up to me

20:40.607 --> 20:42.740
and offers to supply me
with butts

20:42.742 --> 20:46.677
at 25 cents less
than my normal distributor.

20:46.679 --> 20:49.413
And you didn't ask
any questions?

20:49.415 --> 20:50.715
SPIVAK (<i> laughs</i> ):
I'm not on salary.

20:50.717 --> 20:52.617
Every penny counts.

20:52.619 --> 20:55.353
I never heard of no Pilefsky.

20:55.355 --> 20:57.521
Who's your supplier?

20:59.626 --> 21:00.791
Obstruction.

21:00.793 --> 21:02.860
That's another year.

21:02.862 --> 21:03.861
Mm-hmm.

21:03.863 --> 21:07.465
Uh, what's in it for me?

21:07.467 --> 21:08.699
Peace of mind.

21:08.701 --> 21:11.869
Maybe you can keep
your store.

21:14.807 --> 21:18.643
Zalta. A guy named Zalta.

21:18.645 --> 21:20.911
Assault, possession
of stolen goods, tax fraud.

21:20.913 --> 21:22.680
I wouldn't be surprised

21:22.682 --> 21:24.515
if they reopened the case
where the store owner died.

21:24.517 --> 21:25.750
Right, what's his name?
Ahkbar.

21:25.752 --> 21:26.851
The list goes on.

21:26.853 --> 21:28.486
Mind turning around?

21:28.488 --> 21:30.788
I don't know what
you're talking about.

21:30.790 --> 21:32.857
Come on, Mario.

21:32.859 --> 21:34.659
Three truckloads
of bootleg cigarettes

21:34.661 --> 21:36.694
just happen to appear
in your warehouse?

21:36.696 --> 21:37.895
And a store owner

21:37.897 --> 21:40.798
just happens to pull
your name out of a hat?

21:40.800 --> 21:43.401
Suppose I was
in the business.

21:43.403 --> 21:45.303
Certainly no need for muscle.

21:45.305 --> 21:46.937
It's a big market out there.

21:46.939 --> 21:49.540
One vendor don't want
to do business

21:49.542 --> 21:52.476
so then there's a lot
of other takers.

21:52.478 --> 21:53.744
Yeah, and you've never
heard of Pilefsky.

21:53.746 --> 21:55.613
I told you...

21:55.615 --> 21:59.884
I don't associate
with guys like that no more.

21:59.886 --> 22:01.485
Yeah. Sure.

22:01.487 --> 22:04.689
ROBINETTE:
<i> Your witness died.</i>

22:04.691 --> 22:07.558
We can't even charge
Pilefsky with jaywalking.

22:07.560 --> 22:09.694
But Pilefsky used
to work for Zalta.

22:09.696 --> 22:11.613
Past tense.

22:11.614 --> 22:13.531
We know he beat the
hell out of Isaac.

22:13.533 --> 22:15.766
But we can't prove it
with a dead witness.

22:15.768 --> 22:17.401
So he walks?

22:17.403 --> 22:19.470
Unless you can connect them.

22:19.472 --> 22:23.374
Zalta swears on a stack
that he knows squat

22:23.376 --> 22:26.644
about Pilefsky's number
on Skolnik.

22:26.646 --> 22:28.613
We don't need to show knowledge,

22:28.614 --> 22:30.581
just actions furthering
a common criminal goal.

22:30.583 --> 22:32.583
That's the beauty
of conspiracy.

22:32.585 --> 22:33.684
And if not?

22:33.686 --> 22:36.687
Pilefsky walks.

22:39.659 --> 22:42.960
(<i> over speaker</i> ):
Well, fellows,
the good news is

22:42.962 --> 22:48.866
the guy who ID'd you
isn't going to testify.

22:48.868 --> 22:52.403
The bad news
is he's dead.

22:52.405 --> 22:54.672
I don't know
nothing about it.

22:54.674 --> 22:55.740
I'm sure you don't.

22:55.742 --> 22:57.375
It's a coincidence

22:57.377 --> 23:00.611
that your attorney
knew all about our witness

23:00.613 --> 23:03.681
who then unexpectedly
finds himself dead.

23:03.683 --> 23:05.816
You had me locked up.

23:05.818 --> 23:07.518
Even you got friends.

23:07.520 --> 23:09.887
I guess one of them thought
they were doing you a favor.

23:09.889 --> 23:11.889
That's not my problem.

23:11.891 --> 23:13.991
The law says it is.

23:13.993 --> 23:15.726
You're stretching, Logan.

23:15.728 --> 23:19.397
Detective Logan is implying
that the witness's death

23:19.399 --> 23:23.734
was part of some conspiracy
to keep you from going to trial.

23:23.736 --> 23:25.770
And if you had knowledge of it,

23:25.772 --> 23:28.506
you'd be culpable
in the eyes of the law.

23:28.508 --> 23:29.507
That's crap.

23:29.509 --> 23:31.142
I don't know nothing.

23:31.143 --> 23:32.776
Well, someone's making it look
like you did.

23:32.779 --> 23:34.011
Are you charging him?

23:34.013 --> 23:35.780
We're checking into it.

23:35.782 --> 23:38.983
No secrets, right, Counselor?

23:38.985 --> 23:40.751
It's a con, Joe.

23:40.753 --> 23:41.886
Don't fall for it.

23:41.888 --> 23:43.654
GREEVEY:
He's like a
dirty sponge.

23:43.656 --> 23:46.424
Squeeze him, all kinds
of scum comes out.

23:46.426 --> 23:48.692
He don't spin
on Zalta, he walks.

23:48.694 --> 23:50.811
He'll spin.

23:50.812 --> 23:52.929
LOGAN:
Murder two is 25 to life, Joe.

23:52.932 --> 23:56.434
You should have stuck
with assault.

23:56.436 --> 24:01.705
How much did Masucci pay you
to go down on murder two anyway?

24:03.476 --> 24:06.811
So maybe... maybe
I roughed up the Russian.

24:06.813 --> 24:08.579
Shut up, Joe.

24:08.581 --> 24:09.814
I'll talk to you later.

24:09.816 --> 24:11.982
I had nothing to do
with no cigarettes.

24:11.984 --> 24:14.985
I don't know nothing about them
or whacking the nutcase.

24:14.987 --> 24:17.488
So why the number on Isaac then?

24:17.490 --> 24:19.690
He bothered me.

24:19.692 --> 24:21.559
(<i> laughs</i> )

24:21.561 --> 24:25.696
Well, last I heard, annoyance
isn't a valid defense.

24:25.698 --> 24:27.631
They were scared he'd talk.

24:27.633 --> 24:28.632
About what?

24:28.634 --> 24:30.034
Oh, I don't know.

24:30.036 --> 24:32.670
Who was scared, Joe?

24:32.672 --> 24:34.572
You need a road map?

24:34.574 --> 24:39.710
25 years is a long time.

24:39.712 --> 24:41.745
So is dead.

24:44.684 --> 24:46.650
Look, I want to deal.

24:46.652 --> 24:49.787
I don't know nothing
about whacking Hoover.

24:49.789 --> 24:52.990
I'm sure the DA will listen.

24:52.992 --> 24:54.758
Wait a minute.

24:57.530 --> 24:59.663
Harv Beigel.

24:59.665 --> 25:00.731
Mistake.

25:00.733 --> 25:01.932
We want protection.

25:01.934 --> 25:04.568
There's
our connection.

25:06.072 --> 25:09.273
We know that Pilefsky
did a number on Isaac.

25:09.275 --> 25:10.741
The vic can't talk

25:10.743 --> 25:13.744
and our only witness
has passed on.

25:13.746 --> 25:16.113
So far, you've got nothing.

25:16.115 --> 25:17.147
So it seems.

25:17.149 --> 25:19.016
But we also know
our friend Zalta

25:19.018 --> 25:21.919
has been selling bootleg
cigarettes to small vendors.

25:21.921 --> 25:23.287
We got a seller who will talk.

25:23.289 --> 25:25.289
Did Zalta supply Skolnik?

25:25.291 --> 25:28.626
No. It seems Isaac overdosed
on the American Dream.

25:28.628 --> 25:31.262
He wanted nothing to do
with these guys.

25:31.264 --> 25:34.031
LOGAN:
He figure he was
about to squeal

25:34.033 --> 25:36.634
so our friend Pilefsky taught
him that silence is golden.

25:36.636 --> 25:38.168
Now, Pilefsky swears

25:38.170 --> 25:41.005
he knows nothing
about the cigarettes.

25:41.007 --> 25:43.307
He did, however, admit
he was just doing a favor

25:43.309 --> 25:46.176
for his old friend Beigel.

25:46.178 --> 25:48.646
So Beigel is an accomplice
to assault.

25:48.648 --> 25:50.180
It gets better.

25:50.182 --> 25:52.650
Mr. Zalta says
he's too chichi

25:52.652 --> 25:55.152
to associate with riffraff
like Pilefsky.

25:55.154 --> 25:57.154
But it just so happens
he has several truckloads

25:57.156 --> 25:59.657
of stolen cigarettes
in his warehouse.

25:59.659 --> 26:01.191
Guess who owns the warehouse?

26:01.193 --> 26:02.192
Beigel.

26:02.194 --> 26:03.794
LOGAN:
So even if Zalta

26:03.796 --> 26:06.697
and Pilefsky are
telling the truth...

26:06.699 --> 26:08.232
The left hand doesn't know
what the right hand is doing...

26:08.234 --> 26:10.200
STONE:
But they're
washing each other,

26:10.202 --> 26:12.202
so it's conspiracy, gentlemen.

26:12.204 --> 26:14.305
They could all go away
for a long time.

26:14.307 --> 26:17.107
With the possible bonus being...

26:22.782 --> 26:26.150
Oh, no, no,
that's a different story.

26:26.152 --> 26:29.787
Frank Masucci,
he goes for a walk in the woods,

26:29.789 --> 26:32.356
he doesn't leave
many bread crumbs.

26:32.358 --> 26:34.992
Defendants are charged
with assault,

26:34.994 --> 26:39.196
conspiracy to commit assault,
tax fraud and extortion.

26:39.198 --> 26:42.600
JUDGE:
How do you plead,
gentlemen?

26:42.602 --> 26:44.301
Not guilty, Your Honor.

26:46.005 --> 26:47.171
Not guilty.

26:49.208 --> 26:50.708
Not guilty.

26:50.710 --> 26:54.111
Recommendations on bail,
Mr. Stone?

26:54.113 --> 26:56.714
Each of the defendants
has known connections

26:56.716 --> 26:58.749
to organized crime, Your Honor,
and as such,

26:58.751 --> 27:00.284
there is certainly
a risk of flight

27:00.286 --> 27:02.186
from the jurisdiction
of this court.

27:02.188 --> 27:04.388
My client
has a business to run.

27:04.390 --> 27:06.190
May I remind your honor

27:06.192 --> 27:10.094
that he was in no way associated
with the assault?

27:10.096 --> 27:12.062
The assault is part and parcel

27:12.064 --> 27:14.264
of the conspiracy charges,
Mr. Davis.

27:14.266 --> 27:15.799
Your Honor,

27:15.801 --> 27:18.035
Mr. Beigel
has a spotless record.

27:18.037 --> 27:21.205
His only connection
to any so-called criminals

27:21.207 --> 27:22.806
is by way of marriage.

27:22.808 --> 27:25.409
JUDGE:
Many people think blood
is thicker than water.

27:25.411 --> 27:29.113
Bail is set at $150,000.

27:29.115 --> 27:32.249
(<i> indistinct conversations</i> )

27:34.654 --> 27:37.087
Give me a break,
will you, Stone?

27:37.089 --> 27:40.391
Howard Beigel is a major
player in this town.

27:40.393 --> 27:42.292
You want my advice,

27:42.294 --> 27:44.328
I wouldn't bring that up
in court.

27:44.330 --> 27:45.429
Face the facts.

27:45.431 --> 27:47.164
All you've got on Beigel

27:47.166 --> 27:50.134
is the testimony of
some third-rate hoodlum.

27:50.136 --> 27:53.270
Implicating your client
in a major-league conspiracy.

27:53.272 --> 27:54.738
Look, Ben,

27:54.740 --> 27:58.175
we don't want to have
the public humiliation

27:58.177 --> 27:59.443
of a trial.

27:59.445 --> 28:00.911
I'm listening.

28:00.913 --> 28:03.113
Suppose he testifies

28:03.115 --> 28:05.115
against Zalta
and Pilefsky.

28:05.117 --> 28:07.117
I don't need
Beigel's testimony.

28:07.119 --> 28:11.455
How about possession
of stolen goods?

28:11.457 --> 28:13.223
In exchange for what?

28:13.225 --> 28:15.092
Suspended sentence.

28:15.094 --> 28:16.326
You'll be a hero.

28:16.328 --> 28:18.929
Not to that girl
who visits her father

28:18.931 --> 28:20.164
every day in the hospital.

28:20.166 --> 28:22.332
What do you want?

28:25.471 --> 28:27.705
Frank Masucci.

28:27.707 --> 28:31.442
Beigel has nothing to do
with Masucci.

28:31.444 --> 28:33.210
It's a shame.

28:33.212 --> 28:35.279
Guess I'll see you in court.

28:38.384 --> 28:39.783
I don't even smoke.

28:39.785 --> 28:41.852
I hear it's not very good
for your health.

28:41.854 --> 28:43.253
Is it true
your brother-in-law

28:43.255 --> 28:45.155
is involved
in a conspiracy...?

28:45.157 --> 28:48.225
Hey, as far as I know, Harvey's
in the real estate business,

28:48.227 --> 28:50.494
although you never can tell
about in-laws.

28:50.496 --> 28:52.863
Can you comment
on rumors of your involvement

28:52.865 --> 28:55.733
with the disappearance of
union president Russell Mackey?

28:55.735 --> 28:58.302
What do I look like,
a travel agent?

28:58.304 --> 29:00.204
Excuse me.

29:02.208 --> 29:03.807
Big Frankie.

29:03.809 --> 29:05.342
Dandy don.

29:05.344 --> 29:08.345
You, too, can have
monogrammed socks.

29:08.347 --> 29:10.848
I once saw a kid
on the news.

29:10.850 --> 29:13.250
He was going
for a world record.

29:13.252 --> 29:15.853
He had 10,000 dominoes
lined up.

29:15.855 --> 29:18.789
They filled the floor
of Madison Square Garden,

29:18.791 --> 29:20.491
and he flicked the first one

29:20.493 --> 29:23.927
and 30 minutes later,
the last one fell.

29:23.929 --> 29:25.395
Where are you going?

29:25.397 --> 29:26.997
It would be nice, wouldn't it,

29:26.999 --> 29:29.233
to put Frank Masucci
out of business?

29:29.235 --> 29:31.268
The fed has tried.

29:31.270 --> 29:33.537
Always finds a way.

29:33.539 --> 29:36.206
Even if it does turn out

29:36.208 --> 29:39.543
that Masucci was
in on this cigarette scam...

29:39.545 --> 29:42.246
people won't testify
against him.

29:42.248 --> 29:43.547
The dominoes are all lined up.

29:43.549 --> 29:45.015
Why don't we just knock over
the first one,

29:45.017 --> 29:46.450
see where it leads?

29:46.452 --> 29:47.885
A bird in the hand.

29:47.887 --> 29:50.220
Don't forget what
you already got.

29:54.326 --> 29:57.327
It's called
spastic hemiplegia.

29:57.329 --> 30:00.197
He won't be able
to walk.

30:00.199 --> 30:01.565
Sorry.

30:01.567 --> 30:03.300
You got the man?

30:03.302 --> 30:04.434
Yes.

30:04.436 --> 30:07.037
He'll go to jail.

30:07.039 --> 30:09.973
Well, you never know
with a jury.

30:09.975 --> 30:15.512
But I'd feel more secure
if your father would testify.

30:15.514 --> 30:18.248
It's the right thing.

30:18.250 --> 30:20.584
He did the
right thing once.

30:20.586 --> 30:23.554
Look what happened.

30:23.556 --> 30:26.957
I don't know nothing
about assaulting that Russian.

30:26.959 --> 30:28.258
That's the beauty
of conspiracy--

30:28.260 --> 30:30.060
the right hand
can get the left hand

30:30.062 --> 30:31.929
in a whole lot
of trouble.
Hey...

30:31.931 --> 30:33.530
Tell me about Frank Masucci,
was he involved?

30:33.532 --> 30:38.569
What, you actually think I know
what goes on in Camelot?

30:38.571 --> 30:42.406
You're saying that Frank Masucci
was not involved.

30:42.408 --> 30:46.310
I'm saying nobody knows
what Masucci knows.

30:46.312 --> 30:50.614
That's why he eats at 21
and I'm sitting here.

30:50.616 --> 30:54.351
See you in court.

30:54.353 --> 30:55.552
Before we start,

30:55.554 --> 30:59.623
I want simple assault,
suspended sentence.

30:59.625 --> 31:02.960
That depends
on Mr. Beigel's song.

31:02.962 --> 31:04.094
You'll be happy.

31:04.096 --> 31:06.563
No matter what happens
in court,

31:06.565 --> 31:08.365
the deal stands.

31:08.367 --> 31:10.567
You're smart, Stone,

31:10.569 --> 31:13.370
but Frank Masucci...

31:13.372 --> 31:15.539
I'm listening.

31:20.112 --> 31:22.446
Russell Mackey.

31:28.387 --> 31:32.623
What do you know about
our missing union president?

31:35.027 --> 31:37.494
Maybe where he is.

31:37.496 --> 31:41.398
Did Frank Masucci
provide the transportation?

31:41.400 --> 31:43.901
Do we have a deal?

31:43.903 --> 31:48.372
If what Mr. Beigel tells me
helps Mr. Masucci into court,

31:48.374 --> 31:50.374
we can arrange something.

31:50.376 --> 31:54.344
Frank told me
he ordered the hit.

31:54.346 --> 31:57.014
Who pulled the trigger?

31:59.151 --> 32:00.684
Vinny Ruffo.

32:00.686 --> 32:03.320
Masucci's
top mechanic.

32:03.322 --> 32:05.055
And where's the body?

32:09.929 --> 32:12.162
We're not that close.

32:12.164 --> 32:15.132
What about Ruffo?

32:15.134 --> 32:17.034
Um...

32:17.036 --> 32:20.337
my guess is
he's across the Atlantic.

32:20.339 --> 32:21.705
But talk to Pilefsky.

32:21.707 --> 32:24.107
He and Ruffo are old buddies.

32:24.109 --> 32:26.410
Deal?

32:28.113 --> 32:30.380
We're not even sure
Russell Mackey's dead.

32:30.382 --> 32:32.482
He's been missing
for eight months.

32:32.484 --> 32:35.619
Beigel will testify
to Masucci's confession.

32:35.621 --> 32:37.087
And you're going
to believe him?

32:37.089 --> 32:38.722
It's a dangerous lie
to tell.

32:38.724 --> 32:40.457
I don't see a body, do you?

32:40.459 --> 32:43.160
You can't even prove a crime
has been committed.

32:43.162 --> 32:45.729
Adam, the dominoes
are starting to fall.

32:45.731 --> 32:47.731
Beigel ordered the assault
on Skolnik

32:47.733 --> 32:50.067
and you're willing
to let him walk?

32:50.069 --> 32:51.635
Aren't you?

32:51.636 --> 32:53.202
This is Frank Masucci
we're talking about.

32:53.205 --> 32:54.471
All right.

32:54.473 --> 32:56.740
Get me something to corroborate

32:56.742 --> 32:58.709
Beigel's testimony.

32:58.711 --> 33:02.479
Who's going to explain this
to Skolnik and his daughter?

33:07.619 --> 33:09.519
First the homeless guy,
then Mackey.

33:09.521 --> 33:10.988
What next, JFK?

33:10.990 --> 33:12.389
We're not
charging you yet.

33:12.391 --> 33:13.623
What's that supposed to mean?

33:13.625 --> 33:14.992
We know Vinny Ruffo
pulled the trigger.

33:14.994 --> 33:15.993
We know
you were friends.

33:15.995 --> 33:17.027
I don't know nothing.

33:17.029 --> 33:18.195
Put your thinking
cap on, Joe.

33:18.197 --> 33:19.596
Who do you suppose
told us about Ruffo?

33:19.598 --> 33:21.098
How do you think we knew
you were friends?

33:21.100 --> 33:22.632
Sure, I know him,
but that doesn't mean...

33:22.634 --> 33:24.101
Why you protecting him?

33:24.103 --> 33:25.535
Can't you see
you're being fingered?

33:25.537 --> 33:27.604
Beigel wants to deal,
you're the barter.

33:27.606 --> 33:29.206
Beigel and Zalta
are out on bail.

33:29.208 --> 33:31.041
Don't you think it's funny
nobody came forward to help you.

33:31.043 --> 33:32.642
Big fish eat littler fish.

33:32.644 --> 33:34.111
I had nothing to do with it.

33:34.113 --> 33:36.213
Beigel and Zalta
tell a different story.

33:36.215 --> 33:38.215
You know the truth, Joe.

33:38.217 --> 33:39.616
Was it Ruffo?

33:39.618 --> 33:41.184
Did he kill Mackey
on Masucci's orders?

33:41.186 --> 33:43.186
You don't know
what you're asking me.

33:43.188 --> 33:44.721
Was it Ruffo?

34:06.478 --> 34:07.711
Frank Masucci?

34:07.713 --> 34:09.079
MASUCCI:
Yes?

34:09.081 --> 34:10.180
You're under arrest

34:10.182 --> 34:11.515
for the murder
of Russell Mackey.

34:11.517 --> 34:13.033
You have the right
to remain silent.

34:13.034 --> 34:14.550
If you do not choose to
exercise that right...

34:14.553 --> 34:18.188
Don't ruin lunch
for my guests.

34:23.128 --> 34:25.128
Seven to one, I'll be teeing off
at Lacoste Wednesday morning.

34:25.130 --> 34:27.397
What about the
eyewitness testimony?

34:27.399 --> 34:29.833
Ever draw
to an inside straight?

34:29.835 --> 34:32.202
Greed makes people see things
that aren't there.

34:32.204 --> 34:35.439
Mr. Masucci
is a successful businessman.

34:35.441 --> 34:37.858
The DA's office

34:37.859 --> 34:40.276
has this irrational vendetta
against him and his family

34:40.279 --> 34:42.779
simply because of his
Sicilian background.

34:42.781 --> 34:46.183
That's not justice,
it's prejudice.

34:48.187 --> 34:49.786
Mr. Stone, Mr. Stone.

34:49.788 --> 34:52.456
The defense is claiming
that this case is based

34:52.458 --> 34:56.593
solely on your bias against
Mr. Masucci's background.

34:56.595 --> 34:59.362
The laws of
the State of New York

34:59.364 --> 35:02.632
draw a line between civil
and uncivil behavior.

35:02.634 --> 35:05.235
Some people
step over that line.

35:05.237 --> 35:08.505
Against those people, yes,
I am prejudiced.

35:08.507 --> 35:10.440
Excuse me.

35:12.344 --> 35:14.111
Please state your full name
for the record.

35:14.113 --> 35:15.378
Florence Mackey.

35:15.380 --> 35:16.513
Are you married, Ms. Mackey?

35:16.515 --> 35:18.031
I was.

35:18.032 --> 35:19.548
Objection.
Can the witness produce

35:19.551 --> 35:21.118
either a certificate
of divorce

35:21.120 --> 35:22.252
or a death certificate?

35:22.254 --> 35:23.820
Sustained.

35:23.822 --> 35:25.622
Who was your husband?

35:25.624 --> 35:27.524
Russell Mackey.

35:27.526 --> 35:33.130
And what position did he...
excuse me, does he hold?

35:33.132 --> 35:36.399
He's the president of local 297.

35:36.401 --> 35:37.901
And when was the last time

35:37.903 --> 35:39.903
you spoke to or saw
your husband?

35:39.905 --> 35:41.671
Last May-- May 16th.

35:41.673 --> 35:43.173
Thank you.

35:43.175 --> 35:44.841
No further questions.

35:44.843 --> 35:46.543
Do you have
any children, Mrs. Mackey?

35:46.545 --> 35:48.311
Relevance,
Your Honor.

35:48.313 --> 35:50.313
I believe that the
jury is entitled to hear

35:50.315 --> 35:53.416
about the alleged victim's
family life, Your Honor.

35:53.418 --> 35:55.185
I'll allow it.

35:55.187 --> 35:57.888
I have a son.

35:57.890 --> 36:01.925
And when was the last time
you saw your son?

36:03.562 --> 36:06.329
Please answer
the question.

36:06.331 --> 36:08.431
Two years ago.

36:08.433 --> 36:11.201
Did you ever think, Mrs. Mackey,

36:11.203 --> 36:13.570
that perhaps it's your company
that's repellant

36:13.572 --> 36:15.438
to the men
in your life?

36:15.440 --> 36:16.573
Objection, Your Honor.

36:16.575 --> 36:17.607
Withdrawn.

36:22.314 --> 36:25.182
Mr. Zalta, what, if any,
business relationship

36:25.184 --> 36:26.917
do you have with the defendant?

36:26.919 --> 36:29.286
I don't know what you mean.

36:29.288 --> 36:32.589
Permission to treat this witness
as hostile, Your Honor.

36:32.591 --> 36:34.324
Go ahead, Mr. Stone.

36:34.326 --> 36:37.194
In your dealings in the
import-export business,

36:37.196 --> 36:39.362
you frequently retain
trucking companies.

36:39.364 --> 36:40.430
Is that true?

36:40.432 --> 36:41.999
Oh, yes.

36:42.000 --> 36:43.567
Was one of
those companies
Beckner Trucking?

36:43.569 --> 36:45.535
Yeah.

36:45.537 --> 36:49.206
Isn't it true that you have
in the past 24 months

36:49.208 --> 36:52.442
used Beckner Trucking
for 92% of your deliveries?

36:52.444 --> 36:54.611
Could be.

36:54.613 --> 36:55.645
Your Honor?

36:55.647 --> 36:57.480
Make your answers
more responsive,

36:57.482 --> 36:59.416
or you'll be held in contempt.

37:00.485 --> 37:03.253
Did you use Beckner
that much?

37:03.255 --> 37:04.487
Yeah... yes.

37:04.489 --> 37:06.656
And Beckner is a
non-union shop?

37:06.658 --> 37:08.358
Yeah.

37:08.360 --> 37:10.493
So naturally, Mr. Russell
Mackey, as president

37:10.495 --> 37:12.629
of the trucking union, would be
very upset, isn't that true?

37:12.631 --> 37:15.232
I wouldn't know.

37:15.234 --> 37:17.734
Who owns
Beckner Trucking?

37:19.738 --> 37:21.771
You're under oath, sir.

37:26.645 --> 37:28.511
Frank Masucci.

37:28.513 --> 37:30.480
I beg your pardon?

37:30.482 --> 37:32.249
(<i> coughs</i> )

37:32.251 --> 37:34.317
Frank Masucci.

37:36.788 --> 37:39.422
Uh, it was the 4th of July.

37:39.424 --> 37:41.524
I was at Frank's house.

37:41.526 --> 37:44.527
That's the defendant,
Frank Masucci?

37:44.529 --> 37:45.962
Uh, yes.

37:45.964 --> 37:48.531
That's when
he told me.

37:48.533 --> 37:50.667
Told you what,
Mr. Beigel?

37:50.669 --> 37:52.969
Uh...

37:52.971 --> 37:58.441
Frank was tired of Mackey
showing up with his hand out.

37:58.443 --> 38:01.678
Said it wasn't curiosity
that killed the cat.

38:01.680 --> 38:03.680
It was greed.

38:03.682 --> 38:05.582
STONE:
What else
did he say?

38:05.584 --> 38:07.584
Calls for hearsay,
Your Honor.

38:07.586 --> 38:10.387
No, it's a statement
against interest, Your Honor.

38:10.389 --> 38:12.055
Overruled.

38:12.057 --> 38:14.457
He said, uh...

38:14.459 --> 38:20.597
Mackey would no longer
be any trouble,

38:20.599 --> 38:26.603
and he said that Vinny Ruffo
took care of him.

38:26.605 --> 38:28.605
So the defendant
confessed to you

38:28.607 --> 38:31.508
that he ordered
Russell Mackey's murder?

38:31.510 --> 38:34.444
I told you what he said.

38:34.446 --> 38:36.579
Thank you, Mr. Beigel.

38:39.051 --> 38:41.551
So you would
have us believe

38:41.553 --> 38:45.722
that Frank Masucci just
volunteered this information?

38:45.724 --> 38:47.791
That's right.

38:47.793 --> 38:50.694
Did he offer
any colorful details?

38:50.696 --> 38:54.431
Frank said he was disgusted.

38:54.433 --> 38:58.601
He said he wasted four hours
trying to convince him.

38:58.603 --> 39:03.606
So, no cement shoes,
no horse's head in the bed?

39:03.608 --> 39:04.574
Your Honor...

39:04.576 --> 39:06.710
Mr. Zuckert.

39:06.712 --> 39:11.047
Mr. Beigel, isn't it true

39:11.049 --> 39:12.816
that you cut a deal
with the district attorney

39:12.818 --> 39:14.751
in exchange for this testimony?

39:15.821 --> 39:17.721
Yes.

39:17.723 --> 39:21.624
And isn't it also true
that the defendant

39:21.626 --> 39:24.594
is your brother-in-law?

39:24.596 --> 39:25.628
Yes.

39:27.065 --> 39:30.900
There goes that invitation
to Christmas dinner, Mr. Beigel.

39:30.902 --> 39:33.136
Your Honor, please...

39:33.138 --> 39:34.504
Your Honor, even if we assume

39:34.506 --> 39:36.373
that this witness's testimony
is true--

39:36.375 --> 39:38.441
that my client

39:38.443 --> 39:39.776
would be dumb enough
to confess to the murder

39:39.778 --> 39:42.545
of Mr. Mackey--
the rules of evidence are clear

39:42.547 --> 39:44.647
that when
there is no<i> corpus delicti,</i>

39:44.649 --> 39:46.716
the defendant
cannot be convicted

39:46.718 --> 39:49.386
on the basis
of his confession alone.

39:49.388 --> 39:51.888
Where's the beef, Your Honor?

39:51.890 --> 39:53.656
There's no proof
that Mr. Mackey is dead,

39:53.658 --> 39:55.425
let alone murdered.

39:55.427 --> 39:57.794
Now, unless Mr. Stone
can offer some independent

39:57.796 --> 40:01.664
corroborating evidence that
a crime was even committed

40:01.666 --> 40:05.668
I move
for an immediate dismissal.

40:05.670 --> 40:10.740
Thank you for your eloquent
summary of the law, Mr. Zuckert.

40:11.910 --> 40:14.677
Mr. Stone?

40:14.679 --> 40:16.112
The State plans to offer

40:16.114 --> 40:18.681
such corroborating evidence,
Your Honor.

40:18.683 --> 40:21.684
I'm looking forward to it.

40:21.686 --> 40:23.853
Tomorrow, gentlemen.

40:23.855 --> 40:26.556
So Masucci didn't like
paying Mackey off,

40:26.558 --> 40:28.925
but that doesn't mean
that he killed him.

40:28.927 --> 40:31.561
The jury is looking
to convict, Adam.

40:31.563 --> 40:33.563
I think they believe
Beigel's testimony.

40:33.565 --> 40:34.764
Yeah, they may also believe

40:34.766 --> 40:36.699
that he'd say anything
to stay out of jail.

40:36.701 --> 40:38.568
People don't usually
jump at the chance

40:38.570 --> 40:40.437
to testify against
Frank Masucci.

40:40.439 --> 40:42.205
Skolnik's daughter
wasn't pleased.

40:42.207 --> 40:44.707
She know who Frank Masucci is?

40:44.709 --> 40:45.842
She doesn't care.

40:45.844 --> 40:47.577
I don't know if I do either.

40:47.579 --> 40:49.212
We all know you're infallible

40:49.213 --> 40:50.846
when it comes to matters
of faith and morals, Ben.

40:50.849 --> 40:52.949
But for some of us,
it's not so easy.

40:52.951 --> 40:54.784
Isaac Skolnik
is in a hospital bed.

40:54.786 --> 40:56.186
Harv Beigel put him there.

40:56.188 --> 40:57.487
That's real.

40:57.489 --> 40:58.655
I can see that.

40:59.858 --> 41:01.624
Adam?

41:01.626 --> 41:05.562
I don't photograph well
with egg on my face.

41:05.564 --> 41:07.397
How about you?

41:07.398 --> 41:09.231
Since when does
losing a case bother you?

41:09.234 --> 41:11.468
When it affects
public perception

41:11.470 --> 41:12.635
of this office.

41:14.606 --> 41:16.005
Yes, it's a shame
that Beigel walks.

41:16.007 --> 41:17.607
Yes,

41:17.609 --> 41:18.708
it bothers me terribly,

41:18.710 --> 41:19.876
and, yes,
I'd do it again tomorrow

41:19.878 --> 41:21.611
and the next day,
and the day after that

41:21.613 --> 41:23.746
to put a Frank Masucci away,
because as long as he's free,

41:23.748 --> 41:27.016
there will be more Mackeys
and more Skolniks.

41:32.757 --> 41:35.692
The State calls
Joseph Pilefsky.

41:40.732 --> 41:42.899
BAILIFF:
Raise your right hand.

41:42.901 --> 41:44.784
Do you swear
to tell the truth,

41:44.785 --> 41:46.668
the whole truth and nothing
but the truth, so help you God?

41:46.671 --> 41:48.238
PILEFSKY:
I do.

41:48.240 --> 41:51.708
Would you state your full name
for the record, please.

41:51.710 --> 41:53.810
Joe Pilefsky.

41:53.812 --> 41:56.513
Are you employed,
Mr. Pilefsky?

41:56.515 --> 42:00.216
I work at Vincent's
restaurant on 46th.

42:00.218 --> 42:02.719
Been there three years.

42:02.721 --> 42:03.820
Are you familiar

42:03.822 --> 42:05.955
with the name
Vinny Ruffo?

42:05.957 --> 42:07.790
Sure.

42:07.792 --> 42:09.692
Is he employed?

42:09.694 --> 42:13.796
Vinny works for Frank.

42:13.798 --> 42:14.964
Masucci?

42:14.966 --> 42:16.699
That's right.

42:16.701 --> 42:20.603
When was the last time
you met with Mr. Ruffo?

42:20.605 --> 42:22.539
Last spring.

42:22.541 --> 42:25.608
Could it have
been May 16th?

42:26.545 --> 42:28.711
That sounds about right.

42:28.713 --> 42:31.314
Tell us what happened
at that meeting.

42:31.316 --> 42:32.916
I was at the restaurant.

42:32.918 --> 42:35.752
Vinny called.

42:35.754 --> 42:38.955
Asked if he could
come in after I closed.

42:38.957 --> 42:42.091
He said he had
an important meeting.

42:42.093 --> 42:43.960
And did you oblige him?

42:43.962 --> 42:47.330
Sure. Vinny and I go way back.

42:47.332 --> 42:49.566
Then what happened?

42:49.568 --> 42:52.969
Well, um, around 2:00,

42:52.971 --> 42:55.838
this guy Mackey comes in,

42:55.840 --> 42:57.941
and he says he's there
to meet Vinny

42:57.943 --> 42:59.709
so I give him a table.

42:59.711 --> 43:02.011
Was anyone else there?

43:02.013 --> 43:06.583
Just me...
and then Vinny showed up.

43:06.585 --> 43:08.718
And then what happened?

43:08.720 --> 43:11.588
Garrotting.

43:11.590 --> 43:13.823
I had nothing to do with it.

43:13.825 --> 43:15.858
Would you explain for the jury

43:15.860 --> 43:18.661
the meaning
of the word "garrotting"?

43:18.663 --> 43:24.734
It's a wire around the neck.

43:24.736 --> 43:26.769
It's over... like that.

43:26.771 --> 43:29.872
(<i> murmuring</i> )

43:31.142 --> 43:33.042
Thank you.

43:34.312 --> 43:36.713
You said you've
been at the restaurant

43:36.715 --> 43:39.749
for three years, isn't that
correct, Mr. Pilefsky?

43:39.751 --> 43:41.751
PILEFSKY:
Yeah, give or take.

43:41.753 --> 43:43.620
Let's not.

43:43.622 --> 43:47.624
Let's try to be precise.

43:47.626 --> 43:49.892
How many nights a week
do you work?

43:49.894 --> 43:52.695
Six. Sundays off.

43:52.697 --> 43:54.397
Vacations?

43:54.399 --> 43:56.733
I don't like
to travel.

43:56.735 --> 44:00.036
So you worked six nights a week
for three years?

44:00.038 --> 44:01.738
That's right.

44:02.874 --> 44:05.942
How's your health, Mr. Pilefsky?

44:05.944 --> 44:07.844
Relevance, Your Honor.

44:07.846 --> 44:10.713
Goes to the credibility
of this witness's testimony.

44:10.715 --> 44:11.881
I'll allow it.

44:13.151 --> 44:14.784
I'm fine.

44:14.786 --> 44:16.986
Ever been to a hospital?

44:22.761 --> 44:24.127
Yeah.

44:24.129 --> 44:26.362
As a matter of fact,
you had an appendicitis

44:26.364 --> 44:28.698
earlier this year.

44:28.700 --> 44:30.933
So?

44:30.935 --> 44:34.737
So? So, I have your hospital
records here, Mr. Pilefsky.

44:34.739 --> 44:37.140
It appears
that you had complications

44:37.142 --> 44:39.108
following your appendectomy.

44:39.110 --> 44:41.678
It appears that you were
confined to a bed

44:41.680 --> 44:44.447
at Manhattan Memorial Hospital
for the entire month of May.

44:44.449 --> 44:45.815
Isn't that correct?

44:45.817 --> 44:47.884
Why are you perjuring yourself,

44:47.886 --> 44:49.085
Mr. Pilefsky?

44:49.087 --> 44:51.688
What has Mr. Stone
promised you?

44:51.690 --> 44:52.755
Objection, Your Honor.

44:52.757 --> 44:55.425
I demand an immediate mistrial.

44:55.427 --> 44:56.793
A continuance, Your Honor.

44:56.795 --> 44:58.194
Approach.

45:01.833 --> 45:03.733
I want a mistrial
and sanctions

45:03.735 --> 45:05.702
against Mr. Stone.

45:05.704 --> 45:06.869
Sanctions?!

45:06.871 --> 45:08.838
Yes. Prosecutorial misconduct.

45:08.840 --> 45:10.707
Knowingly offering
perjured testimony.

45:10.709 --> 45:12.709
Get off it, Mr. Zuckert.

45:12.711 --> 45:14.877
I did not know
Mr. Pilefsky was lying.

45:14.879 --> 45:17.747
That's what you get
when you bargain for testimony.

45:17.749 --> 45:19.816
Now I submit that this entire
thing was a set up,

45:19.818 --> 45:21.017
and with a continuance,
Your Honor...

45:21.019 --> 45:22.952
Do you have any proof,
Mr. Stone?

45:22.954 --> 45:24.854
Of course he doesn't.

45:24.855 --> 45:26.755
This is not the first time
that an overzealous DA...

45:31.730 --> 45:35.998
Does the State
plan to offer any further

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
corroborating evidence?

45:38.002 --> 45:39.268
With a continuance,
Your Honor.

45:39.270 --> 45:41.738
Oh, at the expense of
my client's reputation.

45:41.740 --> 45:46.075
Mr. Stone should have a case
before he comes to trial.

45:46.077 --> 45:48.911
I'm sorry, Mr. Stone

45:48.913 --> 45:51.214
but you know the law.

45:53.084 --> 45:55.451
LOGAN:
Dismissed?

45:55.453 --> 45:59.856
You mean Masucci
walks for good?

45:59.858 --> 46:01.858
For Mackey's murder, yes.

46:01.860 --> 46:03.159
Double jeopardy.

46:03.161 --> 46:04.494
What about Beigel?

46:04.496 --> 46:05.895
We can still get
him for conspiracy

46:05.897 --> 46:07.497
and assault on Skolnik.

46:07.499 --> 46:09.532
We made a deal.

46:09.534 --> 46:11.834
He kept his end
of the plea bargain.

46:15.807 --> 46:18.207
You got greedy.

46:18.209 --> 46:20.943
They knew it,
and they set you up.

46:24.482 --> 46:26.816
So Pilefsky's perjury

46:26.818 --> 46:30.153
was all part of Frank Masucci's
plan to free Beigel?

46:30.155 --> 46:33.556
And unfortunately,
we can't prove that.

46:33.558 --> 46:35.792
And if we
rescind the deal,

46:35.794 --> 46:37.293
we lose all credibility
in the future.

46:37.295 --> 46:39.562
They don't play by rules,
why should we?

46:39.564 --> 46:41.798
Because that's our job.

46:41.800 --> 46:46.068
Great. Beigel walks,
Masucci walks,

46:46.070 --> 46:47.870
we got squat.
Oh, no.

46:49.874 --> 46:52.341
Masucci's not walking.
