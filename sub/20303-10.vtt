NARRATOR:<i> In the last episode</i>
<i>of </i>Hill Street Blues...

00:03.503 --> 00:05.171
-(tires squealing)
-(screams)

00:07.590 --> 00:10.593
I want this golf ball booked, locked up
or I quit.

00:10.677 --> 00:12.345
You got to put yourself back in reality.

00:12.679 --> 00:15.515
My goal is to have a sandwich
named after me.

00:15.598 --> 00:17.851
I hope you had that checked
like I told you.

00:18.435 --> 00:20.687
Black mole cancer, Ray.

00:20.770 --> 00:23.898
I mean, it can just get you like that.
You'll be dead within four weeks.

00:24.190 --> 00:27.318
I lost my gun, my departmental piece.

00:27.986 --> 00:30.363
-(chuckles)
-Yeah, little did someone stole it.

00:30.447 --> 00:33.575
You know it just seems
like everywhere you look it's just...

00:33.658 --> 00:35.535
death, death, death.

00:35.618 --> 00:36.828
(men laughing)

00:36.911 --> 00:39.164
Excuse me, Captain, this is for you.

00:42.375 --> 00:43.293
It's a subpoena.

00:43.376 --> 00:45.920
Are you implying I'm guilty of a crime,
Mr. Peck?

00:46.004 --> 00:49.132
I'm implying that you may have
perjured yourself today.

00:49.215 --> 00:52.302
Now, who knows what skeletons
a Caribbean past can hold?

00:53.219 --> 00:57.390
Ray, you weren't involved in that
Bay of Pigs fiasco, by any chance?

00:57.474 --> 00:59.350
Will you visit me in prison?

01:00.351 --> 01:03.021
(chuckles) Every Sunday.

01:05.815 --> 01:07.901
ESTERHAUS:<i> Item 11, Operation Fido.</i>

01:07.984 --> 01:10.862
(all barking)

01:10.945 --> 01:14.074
Very funny. Very funny.

01:14.491 --> 01:16.576
But Operation Fido is no laughing matter.

01:16.659 --> 01:21.206
Early this morning, a wino was found
chewed to death in an alleyway.

01:22.165 --> 01:26.127
In recent weeks, our wild dog population
has been responsible for dozens

01:26.211 --> 01:29.964
of house pets murdered
and one confirmed child death.

01:30.048 --> 01:33.510
As many as 40 of these
highly territorial animals

01:33.593 --> 01:36.304
may be found holed up
in the abandoned tenements

01:36.387 --> 01:38.264
at the south end of Jefferson.

01:38.765 --> 01:41.726
The S.P.C.A. has urgently requested
our assistance.

01:42.268 --> 01:43.686
Therefore, check the duty board.

01:43.770 --> 01:45.897
Lieutenant Hunter
will be conducting a briefing...

01:45.980 --> 01:48.108
-Gimme some of that? Yeah?
-...in Roll Call at 8:30 a.m.

01:48.191 --> 01:52.070
Bates, Coffey, Ballantine, Webster,
Gornick, Selwyn, Washington, LaRue.

01:52.153 --> 01:54.864
-What?
-Hey, LaRue, I always knew you dated dogs.

01:54.948 --> 01:56.533
Yeah? Your sister back in town?

01:56.616 --> 02:00.703
Item 12. We'll have two new clerical
personnel on line today

02:00.787 --> 02:04.415
a Ms. Emily Williams
and Mr. Regis Pastorini.

02:05.375 --> 02:09.337
Let's give these new civilian transfers
every opportunity

02:09.420 --> 02:12.465
to begin their work experience on the Hill

02:12.549 --> 02:14.801
productively and happily, shall we?

02:14.884 --> 02:21.057
-(all chattering, laughing)
-I.E., to the<i> ad hoc </i>welcoming committee,

02:21.141 --> 02:25.436
let's try and control ourselves
with regard to...

02:26.104 --> 02:29.858
whoopee cushions, buzzers, rubber pencils,

02:29.941 --> 02:33.528
squirting boutonnieres, exploding cigars,

02:33.611 --> 02:37.282
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

02:37.615 --> 02:38.992
Last item,

02:39.450 --> 02:44.122
once again I am obligated to express
concern vis-à-vis

02:44.205 --> 02:48.543
a certain flair for practical joking
endemic to this department.

02:49.043 --> 02:52.046
To the anonymous wit who placed
the following classified ads

02:52.130 --> 02:55.842
in the personal section
of this week's<i> Adult Free Press,</i>

02:55.925 --> 02:58.887
Uh, "Please spank me,
I love to be spanked. Shari."

02:58.970 --> 03:00.597
(all laughing, hooting)

03:00.680 --> 03:02.765
ESTERHAUS: 555-8161.

03:02.849 --> 03:05.393
And, "Mature dominant lady,

03:05.476 --> 03:09.731
attractive blond in black negligee,
garter belt, hose and heels.

03:09.814 --> 03:11.441
Call Mistress Lucy."

03:11.524 --> 03:15.612
-(all laughing, hooting)
-555-8161.

03:16.154 --> 03:17.363
-Guys, let me remind you,
-I didn't know that.

03:17.447 --> 03:19.365
our phones are busy enough
trying to handle

03:19.449 --> 03:21.117
our fellow citizens' complaints of crime.

03:21.201 --> 03:25.955
Really, their sexual problems
should be directed elsewhere.

03:26.039 --> 03:31.628
Ladies,<i> nos excuses sinceres.</i>
All right, let's roll.

03:31.711 --> 03:33.504
-(chattering)
-And, hey! Hey!

03:35.298 --> 03:36.883
Let's be careful out there.

03:38.885 --> 03:42.013
Oh, Mistress Lucy,
your whip is so stingy and cruel,

03:42.096 --> 03:43.765
but how can I live without it?

03:46.142 --> 03:48.811
She hit me, man.
No, man, she really hit me.

03:48.895 --> 03:51.481
Oh, come on, man.
We gotta hustle us up on some--

03:51.564 --> 03:54.317
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

03:54.400 --> 03:56.110
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

03:56.194 --> 04:00.281
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

04:00.365 --> 04:01.741
(sirens wailing)

04:07.205 --> 04:11.125
(theme song playing)

05:20.862 --> 05:23.990
Some day. First they put me
on the poo-poo squad.

05:24.073 --> 05:27.160
Now it turns out
I'm your basic submissive type.

05:34.250 --> 05:36.336
Uh, what the hell are you guys doing?

05:36.586 --> 05:39.589
-We got an undercover assignment, J.D.
-You?

05:39.672 --> 05:42.342
You think I ought to hide my piece
in my boots, J.D.?

05:45.386 --> 05:47.847
Watch where you're stepping today there,
old boy.

05:52.769 --> 05:54.437
Captain, I was coming to see you.

05:54.520 --> 05:56.898
I mean, what is it,
am I being punished or something?

05:56.981 --> 06:00.401
I mean you've got these juveniles,
these infants, out there in plain clothes

06:00.485 --> 06:03.404
and you got me and Neal
on the hydrant-sniffing tour.

06:03.488 --> 06:06.532
First of all, J.D., I don't have
to justify your assignment to you,

06:06.616 --> 06:08.534
so you can just keep your tongue
in your face.

06:10.661 --> 06:15.249
But the reason is, we're operating
a scam saloon down in South Ferry

06:15.333 --> 06:17.126
with some of Jerry Fuchs's people.

06:17.210 --> 06:18.961
You and Neal have already
worked South Ferry.

06:19.045 --> 06:21.255
They know you there,
so you can't do it, okay?

06:21.339 --> 06:22.382
Yes, sir.

06:25.134 --> 06:29.097
Say, J.D., if Frank Serpico calls, tell
him I'm under for a couple of days, huh?

06:30.348 --> 06:31.724
See ya, J.D.!

06:32.433 --> 06:36.979
I was in that Sullivan Commission
grand jury room less than five minutes

06:37.063 --> 06:38.898
when Donald Peck went for my jugular.

06:38.981 --> 06:40.775
Yeah, we all read the papers, Frank.

06:40.858 --> 06:41.984
Do we have everything covered?

06:42.068 --> 06:43.820
Chits for expenses,
units for personal use?

06:43.903 --> 06:46.114
-We're as clean as a whistle, Frank.
-Henry?

06:46.656 --> 06:49.367
-I think we're fine, Frank.
-Okay, good. Thank you.

06:52.745 --> 06:58.334
-Yes, Phil?
-Well, there is the matter of Art Delgado.

06:58.751 --> 07:03.256
Oh, my God, Delgado.
Get him up here as fast as you can.

07:03.339 --> 07:04.966
-I'll get right on it.
-In uniform.

07:05.049 --> 07:06.050
Right.

07:13.182 --> 07:14.183
Thank you.

07:15.017 --> 07:18.229
Delgado left to go fishing at Taft Lake.

07:19.021 --> 07:20.648
<i>Ave Maria.</i>

07:35.830 --> 07:37.081
I'm gonna get some coffee.

07:40.710 --> 07:42.545
Oh, is this coffee for uniforms only

07:42.628 --> 07:45.339
or are civilian employees
like myself allowed?

07:46.174 --> 07:49.510
-This Coffey's for uniforms and civilians.
-That's cute.

08:03.357 --> 08:06.986
HUNTER: All right, there's just one more
item I'd like to cover here, gentlemen.

08:07.904 --> 08:13.409
We faced one formidable obstacle
in that most search dogs,

08:13.493 --> 08:15.786
including all of the Division's,

08:15.870 --> 08:18.623
are trained for no
more than one specific task.

08:18.706 --> 08:22.543
Hence, no trainer in the area
would lend us his dogs

08:22.627 --> 08:25.630
for our somewhat unique purpose.

08:26.005 --> 08:28.508
I know a guy who has a Mexican hairless
we can get.

08:28.591 --> 08:31.135
-(laughing)
-We're talking dogs, Joe, not women.

08:31.219 --> 08:33.471
-(hooting)
-Funny, J.D., very funny.

08:33.554 --> 08:35.765
Fortunately, I overcame the dilemma

08:36.098 --> 08:39.477
through the aid of an old hunting
chum of mine.

08:39.936 --> 08:42.396
It appears that basset hounds,

08:42.480 --> 08:46.776
besides being among
our foremost canine olfactors,

08:46.859 --> 08:50.446
are extremely underrated as hunting dogs.

08:50.988 --> 08:53.241
Now, a brace of these outstanding animals

08:53.324 --> 08:55.701
are going to be joining us
at the staging area.

08:57.203 --> 08:59.038
-Any questions?
-Yeah.

08:59.121 --> 09:01.624
Uh, we get a dry cleaning allowance
on this one?

09:01.707 --> 09:03.084
(laughter)

09:06.837 --> 09:08.214
WOMAN: Excuse me, Sergeant.

09:11.592 --> 09:15.221
Are the first three digits on the time
card Precinct or Divisional?

09:15.805 --> 09:18.891
It's Divisional, Precinct and Department.

09:21.143 --> 09:23.896
My goodness,
that's an alluring cologne you're wearing.

09:24.730 --> 09:26.482
I'm not wearing any cologne.

09:28.234 --> 09:30.987
Miss Williams, forgive me
if I'm misreading the situation,

09:31.070 --> 09:32.863
but this being your first day of work,

09:33.489 --> 09:36.242
I feel it would only be fair of me
to warn you.

09:36.909 --> 09:39.120
Warn me? What about?

09:39.203 --> 09:41.330
Well-- (chuckles)

09:41.414 --> 09:44.083
I don't know what it is,
my wisdom, perhaps,

09:44.166 --> 09:47.753
my elder statesman ways,
my worldly experience,

09:47.837 --> 09:49.589
savoir faire, joie de vivre--

09:50.131 --> 09:52.258
Who knows? The fact is,

09:52.341 --> 09:55.678
with all due modesty,
women have a tendency to become...

09:56.429 --> 10:00.224
somewhat precipitously enamored of me.

10:00.308 --> 10:03.060
It's a paternal something I exude.

10:04.145 --> 10:06.522
And I just don't want you being hurt.

10:07.231 --> 10:11.944
Believe me, the troubles,
the aches of every description.

10:12.945 --> 10:16.824
I say this not simply
out of moral obligation, Miss Williams.

10:17.450 --> 10:20.119
It's for the protection of both of us.

10:23.372 --> 10:25.791
-(laughs)
-What-- Is anything wrong?

10:26.459 --> 10:28.919
My contact lens is off my eye.

10:31.380 --> 10:34.133
Oh, no. I think it fell under the desk.

10:40.181 --> 10:42.099
It has a little tint of blue in it.

10:43.434 --> 10:46.020
ESTERHAUS: Is it hard or soft?

10:50.691 --> 10:52.860
Hard. Definitely.

10:59.617 --> 11:01.160
Wired and ready, Lieutenant.

11:02.161 --> 11:03.746
You just flick the little switch
under here

11:03.829 --> 11:06.332
and your warning signal's
gonna start to flash.

11:06.791 --> 11:10.336
Uh, Belker, old sport,
you forgot to shave this morning.

11:10.628 --> 11:13.214
No, I didn't.
I never shave in the morning.

11:13.297 --> 11:14.924
Sometimes I'll shave at night.

11:15.299 --> 11:18.302
But, Belker,
you're supposed to look like a bartender,

11:18.386 --> 11:22.932
and unlike detectives on the Hill,
bartenders shave before they go to work.

11:23.015 --> 11:25.810
I'll take care of the customers,
you take care of the video.

11:25.893 --> 11:27.019
Okay, dog breath?

11:28.562 --> 11:30.648
Yeah. Sure.

11:31.816 --> 11:32.817
Sure, Belker.

11:34.110 --> 11:36.237
Now, what does he know about shaving?

11:36.821 --> 11:38.614
All he did is go to school for 20 years,

11:38.698 --> 11:41.659
look at his French teacher's anatomy,
and now he's a lieutenant.

11:42.076 --> 11:44.578
Just my luck. I finally get a chance
to get a little ahead in the ball game,

11:44.662 --> 11:46.872
and my gun gets robbed.

11:46.956 --> 11:49.125
It could set me back, Bobby,
if somebody, like,

11:49.458 --> 11:51.669
assassinated the mayor with it
or something.

11:52.044 --> 11:54.255
You should've reported it
in the first place.

11:54.755 --> 11:56.173
Don't give me that "in the first place."

11:56.257 --> 11:58.968
If you hadn't all of a sudden decided
to get domestic with that Denise,

11:59.051 --> 12:01.512
we could've snuck off with the
Malanchuk sisters after the wedding,

12:01.595 --> 12:02.888
I wouldn't have had to go
to that poker game

12:02.972 --> 12:05.349
and none of this would've happened
in the first place.

12:05.433 --> 12:08.394
You do have a way of looking at things,
don't ya, son?

12:09.353 --> 12:11.188
(knocking)

12:13.816 --> 12:14.734
Customer.

12:16.110 --> 12:17.903
We're not open yet!

12:31.000 --> 12:31.834
Name's Gerson

12:31.917 --> 12:33.961
from the Department of Buildings.
Electrical.

12:35.045 --> 12:36.589
-Are you in charge?
-Yup.

12:37.590 --> 12:40.718
Oh, boy,
you really got some problems here.

12:41.302 --> 12:44.722
For openers, those junction boxes
in the ceiling have all gotta have covers.

12:44.805 --> 12:47.933
And you're way overloaded
on that 15 amp circuit over there.

12:48.726 --> 12:50.311
And look at that fan.

12:50.394 --> 12:53.230
Now you ought to know you can't have wires
exposed like that.

12:53.647 --> 12:56.150
-It needs armored cable.
-Would you like to have a seat?

13:02.948 --> 13:07.995
Yeah, I figure you're looking
at about $3,000-worth of repairs,

13:08.078 --> 13:10.623
bring it up to code,
so I could let you open the front doors.

13:11.957 --> 13:16.670
Of course, I know a guy who can fix it
for you for a hundred bucks.

13:17.046 --> 13:20.049
-You do? Who's that?
-Me.

13:21.550 --> 13:23.928
Wait a minute,
for a hundred bucks you could do that?

13:24.428 --> 13:26.180
What exactly are you telling me?

13:26.263 --> 13:28.682
I could pass the inspection
if I give you a hundred dollars, right?

13:29.016 --> 13:31.352
What's the matter, buddy,
you got a hearing problem?

13:31.602 --> 13:34.188
It's a hundred bucks this month.
Fifty the next.

13:35.064 --> 13:37.608
I only paid 35 up in the Heights.

13:37.691 --> 13:39.360
Inflation hits us all.

13:39.443 --> 13:42.154
No, no, that ain't inflation.
That's robbery.

13:43.030 --> 13:44.114
You don't like it?

13:48.953 --> 13:50.913
All right. All right.

13:53.541 --> 13:55.084
There's your hundred bucks.

13:59.088 --> 14:01.340
Next month put it in an envelope.

14:06.011 --> 14:07.888
Ah, look at this place.

14:09.139 --> 14:13.602
This place is gonna clear, easy,
10 grand a week.

14:14.228 --> 14:16.105
And you begrudge me a lousy hundred.

14:22.820 --> 14:23.904
BELKER: Bingo.

14:32.788 --> 14:35.499
-Did you get that, hairball?
-Ready when you are, guys.

14:45.259 --> 14:46.635
Taft Lake?

14:46.927 --> 14:49.972
-What the hell's Delgado doing up there?
-He's fishing, Francis.

14:50.055 --> 14:53.392
We've sent Willis and Peterson up
in a unit to track him down.

14:53.475 --> 14:56.145
Well, as soon as they do, I want him
in uniform and out in that squad room.

14:56.228 --> 14:58.188
-Mm-hm.
-But what if we cannot find him?

14:58.272 --> 15:01.275
-Don't say "cannot," Ray. Find him.
-All right.

15:01.358 --> 15:04.111
What's the worst case contingency, Henry?

15:04.194 --> 15:07.698
My brother-in-law just got laid off.
We can put him in Delgado's uniform.

15:07.781 --> 15:10.284
We screen all sadists out
at the academy level.

15:18.709 --> 15:21.545
Courtesy of the Reinhold Hunt Club,
gentlemen,

15:23.797 --> 15:25.883
I give you Max and Tyrone.

15:25.966 --> 15:30.387
Purebred registrants of A.K.C.
and the Field Dog Stud Book,

15:30.930 --> 15:35.184
and recipients each, I might add,
of the Schiller Basset Club's

15:35.267 --> 15:38.854
"Golden Mallard" award
for tracking and show.

15:39.229 --> 15:41.398
And while you're doing the door-to-door,

15:42.024 --> 15:46.153
me and the guys here will be closing in
from the perimeter.

15:46.528 --> 15:48.906
You mean you're gonna send
a pair of pedigreed lapdogs

15:48.989 --> 15:51.659
against a pack of wino-eating junkyard
mutts?

15:52.159 --> 15:54.828
Lapdogs? Judas Priest, man!

15:54.912 --> 15:59.208
These animals have been bred for armed
conflict for near eight centuries now.

15:59.291 --> 16:00.584
Look at these teeth!

16:03.295 --> 16:05.589
(growls)

16:06.465 --> 16:08.384
They are virtual fighting machines,

16:08.467 --> 16:10.678
not to mention
their obvious tracking ability.

16:11.679 --> 16:14.056
Okay, people, remember this,

16:14.139 --> 16:17.559
that pack of dogs out there
has tasted human blood.

16:18.602 --> 16:22.523
So let's use our hollow points first
and ask questions later.

16:26.110 --> 16:29.738
Man, I've been kicked in the groin,
beat up, shot and left for dead,

16:29.822 --> 16:31.991
acquired a social disability
directly traceable

16:32.074 --> 16:33.867
to the ongoing pressures of police work.

16:33.951 --> 16:36.662
Where do I find myself
at the ripe old age of 34?

16:36.745 --> 16:39.039
Am I in an upwardly mobile environment?

16:39.123 --> 16:41.417
Am I looking toward
a productive middle age?

16:41.709 --> 16:43.877
Damn, I knew I should've wore gloves.

16:45.629 --> 16:48.549
Come on, Joe,
I know a hickey when I see one.

16:48.632 --> 16:50.467
Who'd you go out with? Vampira?

16:51.051 --> 16:54.096
All right. All right,
so I had a busy dance card this week.

16:55.639 --> 16:59.768
-Are we jealous?
-Me? Jealous?

17:00.269 --> 17:02.396
Look, Joe, I don't care

17:02.479 --> 17:05.274
if you wanna act like a Mediterranean
lounge lizard on your off hours.

17:05.357 --> 17:07.901
I mean, that doesn't mean anything to me,
but I just think

17:07.985 --> 17:10.738
that you ought to be aware of some
of the terrible social diseases

17:10.821 --> 17:13.615
that go along with that sort
of casual activity.

17:14.616 --> 17:17.953
Believe me, Luce,
there was nothing casual about it.

17:25.085 --> 17:28.797
You know, they found some
new Southeast Asian viruses

17:28.881 --> 17:30.632
they haven't even named yet.

17:31.800 --> 17:33.761
Then I tell ya what I'm gonna do,
sweetheart.

17:33.844 --> 17:38.390
If I catch one of these strange viruses,
I'm gonna name it after you.

17:45.689 --> 17:49.568
Take your time, now, guys.
Just breathe it in, Max.

17:50.069 --> 17:52.404
That's it. That's it.
Nose it up there, Ty.

17:56.241 --> 17:59.203
Did you know
that a Basset's olfactory capability

17:59.286 --> 18:02.539
is nearly 200 times that of man's?

18:03.499 --> 18:05.959
(sniffs deeply) Whiff it up there, boys.

18:07.461 --> 18:09.838
Let's find those four-legged killers.

18:10.005 --> 18:12.591
-Lieutenant.
-Ballantine. Shh.

18:13.634 --> 18:16.220
Can't you see these guys
are testing the waters?

18:16.845 --> 18:18.013
(sniffs)

18:21.475 --> 18:25.020
Webster, please,
you're gonna throw them off the scent.

18:25.104 --> 18:26.230
It wasn't me, sir.

18:27.606 --> 18:30.859
I found some dog-pack droppings
in an alley off Ashland.

18:32.694 --> 18:34.988
Good enterprise, Ballantine.

18:35.072 --> 18:40.285
Nothing like a bag of jakes for a hound
to get a mental picture of its prey.

18:42.329 --> 18:45.332
I tell you,
one whiff of that and they'll zero in

18:45.415 --> 18:50.087
on those canine half-breeds
like a couple of heat-seeking missiles.

18:52.673 --> 18:56.468
-Come on, boys.
-(whimpering)

19:03.058 --> 19:05.519
Hey! Who told you to do that?

19:05.602 --> 19:09.148
Watch it, will ya?
Nobody told me to do it. They're dirty.

19:12.901 --> 19:14.987
I want you in the bar like you were told.

19:15.320 --> 19:19.324
And when it's time to play Mr. Fix-it,
I'll let you know.

19:20.325 --> 19:21.827
(growls)

19:37.509 --> 19:39.094
(laughing)

19:44.766 --> 19:48.604
-What do you want?
-Nothing. I come in to see the show.

19:50.939 --> 19:52.566
We don't have no show here.

19:52.858 --> 19:56.361
Oh? Well, how come there's a guy in a cape
and red tights outside

19:56.445 --> 19:58.697
ready to jump through your window?

19:58.780 --> 20:01.783
(laughing)

20:02.576 --> 20:04.620
Hey! Hey! Hey!

20:10.417 --> 20:12.920
-Mick, are you okay?
-What are you doing?

20:13.003 --> 20:15.672
I'm coming to the rescue.
I spotted the signal.

20:15.756 --> 20:18.091
Danger, Mick's in trouble.

20:25.098 --> 20:26.683
(laughing)

20:26.767 --> 20:29.811
-Where are the bad guys?
-They're in your head, playing canasta.

20:36.360 --> 20:39.529
You know, Mick, if that danger signal
was meant as a prank,

20:39.613 --> 20:41.615
I'm not laughing, that is irresponsible.

20:41.698 --> 20:43.408
You're following me, aren't you?

20:43.492 --> 20:45.202
You have been marked
by the Queen of Venus.

20:45.285 --> 20:47.454
She has her "mutoids" looking for you
everywhere.

20:47.537 --> 20:49.456
This has gotta stop,
do you understand that?

20:49.539 --> 20:53.001
I don't wanna see you anymore.
I don't wanna know you. You're a beanbag.

20:53.085 --> 20:56.171
Look at you. You're a banana pie.
Get out of this place.

20:56.255 --> 20:59.675
I want you out of my life.
I want you off this planet.

20:59.967 --> 21:01.760
I want you to picture something, Mick.

21:02.177 --> 21:07.432
A little boy alone in his room,
no friends, no pets,

21:07.808 --> 21:11.186
his only plaything,
a toy truck without any wheels

21:11.270 --> 21:13.021
that he picked out of the trash.

21:13.438 --> 21:15.691
The kids outside ridiculed him
because he was born

21:15.774 --> 21:17.776
with one leg shorter than the other.

21:18.235 --> 21:21.905
His father drinks and beats him,
his mother walks the room at night

21:21.989 --> 21:23.949
screaming that she never wanted him.

21:24.032 --> 21:28.704
There is a tiny,
dark space behind the bureau

21:28.787 --> 21:30.330
that he crawls into.

21:31.540 --> 21:36.461
A hiding place from the endless ache
of his life.

21:37.087 --> 21:38.255
While he's there,

21:39.298 --> 21:42.467
he spends the hours pretending
that a beautiful woman

21:42.551 --> 21:45.679
in a white gown holds him in her arms

21:46.346 --> 21:48.974
and tells him that she loves him.

21:51.977 --> 21:54.688
That's the only way he can survive, Mick.

21:55.272 --> 21:58.650
Escape... to make-believe.

21:58.984 --> 22:03.822
A kitchen table becomes a castle,
a broken chair a rocket to the moon.

22:03.905 --> 22:06.074
Is it right to take that away from him?

22:06.158 --> 22:10.287
Is it right to cancel out
the last sanctuary

22:10.370 --> 22:12.497
that human suffering can run to?

22:12.748 --> 22:16.918
Captain, I'm sorry.

22:18.754 --> 22:20.130
Oh, no need, Mick.

22:20.964 --> 22:25.886
The boy grew up, bought into computers,
and now he owns half of Davenport, Iowa.

22:26.261 --> 22:28.013
I read it in<i> Reader's Digest.</i>

22:30.474 --> 22:31.725
(groans)

22:33.602 --> 22:36.646
You will never believe
what I saw just ten minutes ago.

22:37.147 --> 22:40.400
A five-car pile-up on the Niagara Street
off-ramp.

22:40.484 --> 22:42.861
There were stretchers all over the place.

22:43.695 --> 22:47.074
-Uh, gee. I gotta go.
-Me too.

22:47.908 --> 22:49.368
-Nice to see you, Fay.
-Hi, Henry.

22:49.451 --> 22:51.286
-Excuse me, Fay.
-Phil.

22:51.703 --> 22:52.746
<i>Adios, </i>Fay.

22:56.458 --> 22:59.753
-How are you, Fay?
-Pretty good, Frank.

23:01.463 --> 23:03.924
-You are?
-I really am.

23:04.216 --> 23:06.426
I think I'm finally over the hump.

23:07.010 --> 23:10.389
Figuratively speaking, of course.
(chuckles)

23:10.472 --> 23:12.182
It's good to see you smile again.

23:13.809 --> 23:17.396
I suppose you have plans
for lunch later on?

23:20.816 --> 23:24.986
Well, I figured as much,
so I picked up a sandwich on my way over.

23:25.070 --> 23:27.989
-You don't mind?
-Mind what?

23:28.657 --> 23:31.451
Do you realize that aside from Frank Jr.
on the weekends,

23:31.535 --> 23:35.288
I haven't had lunch with a fellow human
since Hal passed away?

23:37.040 --> 23:39.835
You know, with all the noise
and activity here, Frank,

23:39.918 --> 23:43.004
it's just a much more cheery place
to have lunch, don't you think?

23:48.301 --> 23:50.554
Frank, I'm sure you have a ton of work
to take care of,

23:50.637 --> 23:53.348
so why don't you just, you know,
pick up where you left off.

23:53.807 --> 23:55.642
Stop treating me like a guest.

23:59.062 --> 24:01.940
-You don't want to talk?
-I brought a book.

24:04.651 --> 24:07.237
WOMAN: I can file those papers now.
Thank you.

24:09.531 --> 24:12.826
Go back to work, Frank. Really, I'm fine.

24:13.952 --> 24:16.246
Just pretend I'm part of the furnishings.

24:30.927 --> 24:33.930
Unless you'd rather be buried
with Ms. Davenport.

24:35.724 --> 24:38.810
Don't you think it's about time
we considered cemetery plots, Frank?

24:42.314 --> 24:43.899
-ESTERHAUS: No! No!
-Phil.

24:46.026 --> 24:48.361
Can you tell me what a "984-Z" is?

24:48.904 --> 24:51.239
It's a personnel transfer
and relocation form, Ray.

24:51.323 --> 24:52.574
Everybody knows that.

24:52.657 --> 24:54.701
Miss Emily Williams doesn't.

24:55.035 --> 24:57.204
I asked her to process a couple,

24:57.287 --> 25:00.207
and she thought I was talking
about a sports car.

25:00.957 --> 25:05.212
-So?
-So, don't you find that ironic?

25:05.295 --> 25:08.465
Ironic? No, Ray, I don't.

25:08.715 --> 25:13.553
A new employee alleging nearly eight years
of police clerical work

25:13.637 --> 25:17.724
has never even heard of a 984-Z,
and you don't find that ironic?

25:18.058 --> 25:22.395
Well, I find it somewhat surprising.
Unorthodox, perhaps.

25:22.479 --> 25:25.148
But, certainly not ironic.

25:25.565 --> 25:30.362
Ironic by me includes "surprising"
and "unorthodox."

25:46.044 --> 25:47.295
Ballantine,

25:48.547 --> 25:51.383
there's no "X" on that door down there.

25:53.051 --> 25:54.344
Ballantine!

25:57.180 --> 25:59.266
(sighs) For crying out loud.

26:06.898 --> 26:09.609
-I'll deal with you two later.
-(both whimper)

26:09.693 --> 26:11.528
The Golden Mallard Award.

26:32.007 --> 26:33.800
(inhales, sighs)

26:37.470 --> 26:39.764
(dog growling)

26:47.188 --> 26:48.523
Canines.

27:10.879 --> 27:14.674
-(clattering)
-(dogs barking)

27:29.773 --> 27:32.192
(growls, whimpers)

27:32.817 --> 27:35.320
(screams)

27:59.844 --> 28:00.887
Thank you.

28:05.016 --> 28:06.267
DAVENPORT: What's the bad news?

28:06.351 --> 28:10.397
-The bad news is you're pitching tomorrow.
-(laughing)

28:12.899 --> 28:15.276
-Frank, this is Douglas Comstock.
-How are you?

28:15.360 --> 28:18.405
So, you're in hot water
with "Tail Gunner" Peck?

28:19.406 --> 28:22.701
The guy holds up his socks with garters.
Can you believe it?

28:24.369 --> 28:27.163
Doug represents three police officers

28:27.247 --> 28:30.166
who've been subpoenaed at one time
or another by the Commission.

28:30.250 --> 28:33.002
-No conflict of interest, I trust?
-No, no. No worry.

28:34.254 --> 28:39.134
Frank, I'll tell you straight off
what I tell all my clients, I won't pry.

28:39.467 --> 28:42.095
You tell me only as much as you feel
comfortable telling me.

28:42.512 --> 28:44.723
Of course, the more you reveal,
the more I can do.

28:45.849 --> 28:49.394
Do I sense an implication that you feel
I must have done something?

28:49.477 --> 28:53.440
That's precisely
what I'd rather not get into, Frank.

28:53.898 --> 28:55.692
What's your retainer, Mr. Comstock?

28:57.569 --> 28:58.695
"Doug," please.

28:58.778 --> 29:02.449
Um, that's something
we don't need to get into.

29:02.532 --> 29:06.077
We'd better.
I'm not into Savile Row suits.

29:06.703 --> 29:09.706
Good thing. They look lousy in court.

29:10.373 --> 29:12.167
Especially on precinct captains.

29:14.294 --> 29:18.548
My fee is 7,500 in advance
against 250 an hour.

29:18.631 --> 29:20.842
I've talked this over with Joyce,
in this case,

29:20.925 --> 29:23.344
I am prepared to halve the advance.

29:24.220 --> 29:25.764
I can pay my way.

29:25.847 --> 29:29.392
-Thank you. A club soda, please.
-Vermouth on the rocks, please.

29:33.855 --> 29:37.317
Now, what we have to do
is give you some lines to say,

29:37.650 --> 29:41.404
ready answers with lots of polish,
no brass.

29:42.030 --> 29:44.616
No pressure, Frank.
Do you want to talk about South Ferry?

29:45.116 --> 29:47.827
-What have you told him about South Ferry?
-We're trying to help you, Frank.

29:47.911 --> 29:50.663
It would also be helpful if I
knew the game plan Daniels has fed you

29:50.747 --> 29:51.706
against Sullivan.

29:51.998 --> 29:57.587
Mr. Comstock, I have an obligation to keep
police business police business.

29:57.670 --> 29:59.047
Get your head up, Captain.

29:59.506 --> 30:02.133
Daniels is landing little guerrilla armies
all over town.

30:02.467 --> 30:05.136
The police department isn't being helped
any by this investigation,

30:05.220 --> 30:06.763
and he's determined to come out
of this like a rose.

30:06.846 --> 30:09.891
Now your problem is,
you're so stuck with being a team player

30:09.974 --> 30:11.434
you don't know what's happening.

30:11.684 --> 30:14.103
If he shucks you, you've got to shuck him.

30:14.187 --> 30:15.980
Do you think I'm guilty of something?

30:17.357 --> 30:18.733
That's none of my business.

30:18.817 --> 30:22.487
Do you think I'm part of what
the Sullivan Commission is all about?

30:22.779 --> 30:26.241
That I'm using you to help get me out
from under something?

30:26.324 --> 30:27.367
Frank.

30:27.826 --> 30:30.036
-Cops watch after each other,
don't they, Frank?

30:30.453 --> 30:32.539
So you want to put a new coat of paint
on the outhouse.

30:32.622 --> 30:34.791
No, thanks, Counselor. Take a walk.

30:36.543 --> 30:38.962
(sighs)

30:39.504 --> 30:44.008
Joyce, let me go sit in the bar
for the moment.

30:44.551 --> 30:47.387
You discuss it with Frank,
and if he wants my services...

30:57.897 --> 30:59.315
What are you trying to prove?

30:59.899 --> 31:01.901
I just don't think it's in my interest

31:01.985 --> 31:05.530
to hire an attorney who believes
I'm guilty by the color of my eyes.

31:06.197 --> 31:07.949
Would you please listen to yourself?

31:08.741 --> 31:10.034
You walked into that grand jury

31:10.118 --> 31:12.787
thinking your natural innocence
would shine like a light.

31:12.871 --> 31:13.913
How naive.

31:14.747 --> 31:17.333
If Doug thinks all police officers
are on the take,

31:17.417 --> 31:19.919
then he's just parroting the attitude
of the community,

31:20.003 --> 31:21.629
the people in that grand jury room.

31:22.797 --> 31:25.758
So let's forget about looking innocent
and get to work on proving it.

31:30.513 --> 31:32.765
I'm going to tell Doug
you want to retain him.

31:43.902 --> 31:46.988
Hey, speak up a little, would you,
Ballantine? I can hardly hear you.

31:47.071 --> 31:52.201
<i>We're at Avenue D and Jefferson, LaRue.</i>
<i>We haven't seen any sign of him yet.</i>

31:52.285 --> 31:55.455
We'll keep up the door-to-door down
Jefferson to Avenue C.

31:55.788 --> 31:58.958
<i>You check out every one of those dumps</i>
<i>that hasn't been "X'd" yet.</i>

31:59.292 --> 32:00.877
BALLANTINE:<i> You got it. Over and out.</i>

32:00.960 --> 32:04.589
<i>Coffey, Bates, this is Washington.</i>
<i>What's happening out there?</i>

32:04.672 --> 32:07.675
COFFEY: Yeah, Neal, we just finished up
the north end of Avenue B

32:07.759 --> 32:09.969
between Jefferson and Utica,
but no Hunter.

32:10.470 --> 32:12.305
COFFEY:
<i>Maybe he went to lunch or something.</i>

32:12.847 --> 32:16.309
Sure, Joe. Sure. The neighborhood's just
loaded with five-star joints.

32:16.392 --> 32:18.353
-Hey, keep looking, huh, Joe?
<i>-</i>COFFEY:<i> Right.</i>

32:19.479 --> 32:21.356
Hey, how about taking a unit
'round the back of these projects

32:21.439 --> 32:23.358
-and see what you turn up, okay?
-Right.

32:25.485 --> 32:28.154
-(sighs)
-Great operation, Neal.

32:28.738 --> 32:31.324
Wind chill factor's down
to a good minus 80,

32:31.407 --> 32:33.368
the canine corps
won't get out of the damn car

32:33.451 --> 32:35.578
and the ramrod of the whole gig
got himself lost

32:35.662 --> 32:37.205
for the rest of the afternoon.

32:38.748 --> 32:41.834
I'm telling you, man,
we're wasting away here by the second.

32:41.918 --> 32:44.170
Yeah, I know, babe. Hawaii.

32:59.686 --> 33:01.896
(speaking French)

33:01.980 --> 33:04.816
-Hiya, Phil.
-Well, hello, Art.

33:04.899 --> 33:06.901
Good to see you, you old reprobate.

33:06.985 --> 33:08.277
You're looking swell.

33:09.487 --> 33:11.072
The place is the same.

33:12.991 --> 33:17.328
-It sure is. It sure is.
-So? Here I be.

33:19.789 --> 33:23.459
I want you to know that I'm ready
for whatever it is you need me for.

33:24.168 --> 33:25.920
Something big going down?

33:26.004 --> 33:29.882
Well, you know, Art, we always need
a sharp pair of eyes here at the fort.

33:29.966 --> 33:33.636
Phil, I'm gonna need my pistol back.

33:33.720 --> 33:35.221
Oh, sure. Plenty of time for that.

33:35.304 --> 33:38.683
The important thing is for you
to re-acclimate yourself

33:38.766 --> 33:40.393
around the clubhouse.

33:51.070 --> 33:53.156
Wow!

33:56.409 --> 34:00.538
(exhales, coughs)

34:04.083 --> 34:06.711
BATES (on radio):<i> Joe, did you look</i>
<i>in the lot behind the wall?</i>

34:07.253 --> 34:10.298
COFFEY:<i> Twice. Look, I'll check it again</i>
<i>and work back toward you.</i>

34:13.968 --> 34:17.096
Coffey! Bates!

34:37.033 --> 34:39.619
Problem situation upstairs!

34:42.705 --> 34:44.248
Get up here on the double!

34:44.999 --> 34:46.209
Move it!

34:52.507 --> 34:55.760
Officer needs assistance! Code 211!

34:58.262 --> 35:00.306
Hey, guys, I'm up here!

35:04.685 --> 35:09.232
Help! Help!

35:31.712 --> 35:34.048
So what if she's been poking
around a little?

35:34.132 --> 35:38.594
It's the natural exploratory instinct.
A way of settling in to a new environment.

35:38.678 --> 35:39.720
What about this?

35:40.721 --> 35:43.558
There was a computer in Washington
that lost Idaho.

35:43.641 --> 35:46.644
I don't buy it. That's why I'm calling
a friend of mine in Personnel.

35:46.727 --> 35:49.897
Ray, you're just naturally suspicious
of gorgeous women.

35:49.981 --> 35:53.818
-It's a... It's a Mediterranean mind-set.
-Yes, yes, yes. I'm here.

35:57.196 --> 36:00.700
What? Are you sure?

36:01.325 --> 36:03.119
Are you positively sure?

36:04.328 --> 36:06.205
Thanks, Jimmy. I owe you on this one.

36:07.790 --> 36:10.543
-So?
-We got trouble, Henry.

36:17.258 --> 36:20.678
(sighs) Chances of survival are optimum.

36:22.180 --> 36:26.934
The trick is to maintain a clear faculty.

36:30.479 --> 36:32.899
-(dog growling)
-Things have been much worse.

36:32.982 --> 36:37.528
-(breathing heavily)
-(growling, barking)

36:37.987 --> 36:40.406
(barking, snarling)

36:44.285 --> 36:49.540
-(grunts)
-(barking)

36:49.624 --> 36:51.375
(growling)

36:51.459 --> 36:52.877
(barking)

36:52.960 --> 36:57.048
-(snarling, barking)
-(grunting)

36:58.257 --> 37:00.259
-(whimpers)
-(barking)

37:42.969 --> 37:46.430
(barking, snarling stops)

37:47.306 --> 37:48.641
(sighs)

37:59.527 --> 38:01.946
-Come in.
-You wanted me, Captain?

38:07.076 --> 38:09.078
Who sent you here, Ms. Williams?

38:09.578 --> 38:11.372
I was assigned out of the Division pool.

38:11.455 --> 38:12.456
Why? Is there anything wrong with my work?

38:12.540 --> 38:15.960
Please, drop the act, Detective.
We know who you are.

38:20.006 --> 38:22.174
If you don't mind my asking,
how did you find out?

38:22.258 --> 38:25.261
Let's just say we have a keen instinct
for deception up here on the Hill.

38:26.053 --> 38:28.931
-It would seem so.
-What does that mean?

38:29.307 --> 38:32.476
It's hard to know just how far
out of policy you are, Captain.

38:33.060 --> 38:34.979
But aside from the usual stuff,

38:35.062 --> 38:37.064
officers signing each other out early,

38:37.148 --> 38:39.817
use of the postage meter
for personal mail,

38:39.900 --> 38:42.737
money appropriated from petty cash
and never reimbursed.

38:43.029 --> 38:45.448
There's the matter
of a certain Officer Delgado

38:45.531 --> 38:48.200
who has the strangest schedule
I've ever seen.

38:48.576 --> 38:52.663
According to records, he's worked
multiple shifts in the same day,

38:52.747 --> 38:56.250
he's made simultaneous arrests
miles apart.

38:56.751 --> 38:57.960
It's none of my business, Captain,

38:58.044 --> 39:01.255
but I met your Officer Delgado
a little while ago,

39:01.339 --> 39:03.883
and, quite honestly, one gets the feeling

39:03.966 --> 39:06.510
he ought to be doodling
in his coloring book.

39:07.720 --> 39:08.971
Get out of here.

39:14.310 --> 39:16.812
I'd always heard good things
about you, Captain.

39:17.104 --> 39:18.481
I hope they're true.

39:26.822 --> 39:31.619
"Believe me, Frank, I need your help.
Square business, Frank.

39:31.702 --> 39:34.580
You're one of only four men
in the entire department I can trust."

39:34.663 --> 39:37.291
Believe me, Frank,
it was for your own benefit.

39:38.084 --> 39:41.545
You plant a department spy in my squad
room and you call that a benefit?

39:41.629 --> 39:44.715
What did you expect me to do,
take out an ad in the<i> Police Gazette?</i>

39:44.799 --> 39:46.509
It's a jungle out there, Frank.

39:47.134 --> 39:48.886
And who'd you rather have digging
through your garbage,

39:48.969 --> 39:51.764
me or that little hatchet man Sullivan?

39:51.847 --> 39:53.891
Right now I'm hard-pressed
to see the difference.

39:54.225 --> 39:56.852
You're taking a very parochial view
of all this, Frank.

39:57.228 --> 40:00.189
At least if any wrongdoing
is exposed in my investigation,

40:00.272 --> 40:02.066
we can handle it internally...

40:02.983 --> 40:04.151
so to speak!

40:05.611 --> 40:07.446
And if you don't mind my saying so,

40:07.530 --> 40:10.157
I think it's in damn poor taste
to come down and lay this on me

40:10.241 --> 40:13.035
not two hours after losing
half my rectal history

40:13.119 --> 40:15.413
to those snip-happy plumbers downstairs.

40:15.871 --> 40:17.498
As for your backside, Chief,

40:17.581 --> 40:19.750
I'd say you've done a pretty fair job
of covering it.

40:19.834 --> 40:22.920
A good trick to know,
now that it's every man for himself.

40:23.879 --> 40:25.589
Let's don't get reckless, Frank.

40:25.673 --> 40:28.634
You've been like a kid brother to me.
I'd like to keep it that way.

40:29.885 --> 40:31.887
Time to change your dressing, Chief.

40:33.722 --> 40:36.517
-Who are these women?
-Student nurses.

40:36.934 --> 40:41.564
Don't be embarrassed, Chief.
To us you're just another patient.

40:41.647 --> 40:44.316
(paper rustling)

40:58.497 --> 41:01.000
-How's everything, Howard?
-Oh, just dandy, Frank.

41:01.667 --> 41:03.919
They're keeping me overnight
for observation.

41:04.003 --> 41:06.964
Yeah, I just got a couple of minor
scratches, that's all.

41:07.548 --> 41:10.009
Sounds as if you
had a frightening experience.

41:10.926 --> 41:16.348
Well, tell the truth, Frank,
I have never really known fear.

41:16.932 --> 41:19.643
My mind was working
like a computer out there.

41:20.352 --> 41:23.689
Sifting options,
making split-second decisions.

41:23.981 --> 41:25.107
Howard,

41:25.858 --> 41:28.652
I'm putting you in
for an "A" and "B" Citation,

41:28.736 --> 41:30.279
and for a Medal of Valor.

41:34.200 --> 41:36.869
Well, I can't tell you how much
that means to me, old sport.

41:39.455 --> 41:42.082
It's a dirty and dangerous job that we do,

41:44.210 --> 41:49.465
but that sort of peer group recognition...

41:51.550 --> 41:53.594
(sobs) ...makes it all worthwhile.

41:53.677 --> 41:55.804
-I'm sorry.
-(knocking)

41:55.888 --> 41:59.266
Uh, excuse me,
you got a Howard Hunter in here?

41:59.350 --> 42:01.852
(sighs) I'm Lieutenant Hunter.

42:07.525 --> 42:08.734
Sweet Madonna.

42:10.444 --> 42:12.738
(stutters) Are these for me?

42:12.947 --> 42:14.990
Yeah. And the card comes with them.

42:17.243 --> 42:21.539
"I sometimes think that never blows
so red the rose

42:21.622 --> 42:25.292
as where some buried Caesar bled."

42:26.377 --> 42:27.586
(laughs)

42:28.170 --> 42:32.091
No one has ever sent flowers to me before.

42:33.676 --> 42:36.178
-Who's it from?
-The Sullivan Commission.

42:36.262 --> 42:37.972
You've been subpoenaed to reappear.

42:40.224 --> 42:42.935
Judas H. Priest!

42:43.811 --> 42:48.857
I have worn the brown helmet in my day,
but this is inexcusable.

42:49.191 --> 42:53.153
How could any right-thinking man
pull this kind of despicable,

42:53.237 --> 42:54.947
gutter-snipe maneuver?

42:56.532 --> 42:59.827
-Get out of here, you unprincipled mange!
-Hey!

43:00.244 --> 43:03.914
Wait a second here.
And I'm a human being too, you know?

43:04.790 --> 43:09.920
Think people care about my feelings?
No way. People treat me like dirt.

43:10.004 --> 43:11.714
Folks even set their dogs on me.

43:11.797 --> 43:15.634
-Don't talk to me about dogs, sir!
-Easy, Howard. Take it easy.

43:15.718 --> 43:18.679
You know, nobody appreciates the artistry
involved, the expense.

43:18.762 --> 43:19.763
I got overhead.

43:20.306 --> 43:24.018
You think these outfits just come my way?
And what about the flowers?

43:24.560 --> 43:27.980
I had a kid in the hospital for tonsils
last month. Set me back over a grand.

43:28.063 --> 43:29.648
Who do you think pays for all that?

43:30.983 --> 43:32.234
Sure, it's a rotten job.

43:32.318 --> 43:34.820
I'd rather be Bunky Hunt,
but someone's gotta do it.

43:36.238 --> 43:38.741
Captain Furillo?
Phone call out at the desk.

43:38.824 --> 43:40.534
Oh, thank you. Howard.

43:40.618 --> 43:42.786
Frank Furillo? This one's for you.

43:47.750 --> 43:48.876
Have a nice day.

43:50.544 --> 43:51.545
Out.

44:00.846 --> 44:04.642
Hey, is it asking too much of you
not to spill beer on my date?

44:04.725 --> 44:07.311
-Excuse me.
-Well, wipe it up.

44:07.936 --> 44:09.605
You wipe it up, barfbag.

44:11.774 --> 44:14.818
Andale, Garçon. Couple of young tunas down
there just dying for a quaff

44:14.902 --> 44:16.111
of that Sauvignon Blanc.

44:16.195 --> 44:19.406
WOMAN: Excuse me, bartender. Over here.

44:19.990 --> 44:22.159
-There's more people in here than--
-MAN: Bartender!

44:22.242 --> 44:25.245
-You got a hearing problem?
-Hold your water, spitoon-face.

44:25.329 --> 44:28.457
-I'll be there in a minute.
-You tell 'em, Cary Grant.

44:59.029 --> 45:01.323
-Can I help you, my man?
-Where's the owner?

45:01.407 --> 45:04.493
(laughs) You're looking at him.
At least, one of them.

45:04.576 --> 45:06.578
My partner's not here right now.

45:07.454 --> 45:09.998
-What can I do for you?
-Sit down.

45:12.418 --> 45:13.585
Yeah, sure.

45:17.214 --> 45:21.385
-What'll you have?
-Whiskey, straight up.

45:22.469 --> 45:25.264
Jackson! Whiskey straight up.

45:27.224 --> 45:31.103
-Business is looking good.
-We got a great location.

45:31.186 --> 45:35.065
-You also have a serious parking problem.
-What do you mean?

45:36.108 --> 45:39.653
You got a red zone out front.
No place to park.

45:40.279 --> 45:43.657
Well, you know,
we're banking on a lot of foot traffic.

45:45.075 --> 45:46.493
You're not hearing me, boy.

45:47.619 --> 45:49.496
You got a student population here.

45:50.289 --> 45:51.123
Now how many of 'em do you think

45:51.206 --> 45:54.001
are holding a couple of joints right now,
maybe a little blow?

45:54.877 --> 45:55.711
Hmm?

46:00.799 --> 46:02.676
What are you saying exactly?

46:03.552 --> 46:06.680
I'm saying a hundred bucks a week'll make
your parking problem go away.

46:08.098 --> 46:10.851
What you're saying is that
for a hundred bucks a week,

46:11.226 --> 46:12.811
my customers won't be harassed?

46:12.895 --> 46:14.104
Hm.

46:16.607 --> 46:18.859
Consider it a promotional expense.

46:20.486 --> 46:23.280
-Hmm?
-Yeah.

46:31.246 --> 46:33.707
Don't take it so hard, boy.
You got a gold mine here,

46:33.791 --> 46:35.501
if you don't screw it up.

46:36.835 --> 46:38.003
You know what I'm saying?

46:42.716 --> 46:44.510
-Hmm?
-Yeah.

46:46.553 --> 46:47.429
Okay.

46:52.184 --> 46:53.227
Be a good boy.

47:10.744 --> 47:13.664
I don't want Douglas Comstock
for my attorney.

47:14.623 --> 47:16.416
-If it's the money--
-It's not.

47:17.835 --> 47:19.086
Your decision, Frank.

47:21.213 --> 47:24.758
What would you say if I told you
that Michael Sullivan,

47:25.342 --> 47:28.428
Fletcher Daniels, Donald Peck,

47:29.388 --> 47:32.182
a fiendish Mata Hari named Emily Williams

47:32.266 --> 47:34.226
and Art Delgado

47:34.309 --> 47:39.314
are all up to their wishbones
in an insanely clever plot

47:39.731 --> 47:43.443
to sully the shining reputation
of an Italian precinct captain?

47:44.486 --> 47:45.821
Who's Art Delgado?

47:48.073 --> 47:49.324
Burn-out case.

47:50.534 --> 47:54.162
Cop who lost it six months
before his twenty-year pension.

47:54.997 --> 47:57.541
We've been keeping him on the roster
as a paper soldier.

47:57.624 --> 48:01.295
You know, signing him in and out
so he can retire with enough to live on.

48:02.129 --> 48:04.339
-Sullivan know about him?
-He will.

48:05.966 --> 48:07.593
Sounds like a violation.

48:09.219 --> 48:10.596
It is a violation.

48:15.309 --> 48:18.228
-Anything I can do, Frank?
-Mm-hmm.

48:18.312 --> 48:20.439
(laughs)

48:20.522 --> 48:23.817
Don't leave town for the next eight hours.
Okay?

48:39.958 --> 48:42.961
(closing theme playing)
