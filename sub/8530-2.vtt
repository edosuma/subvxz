00:00.125 --> 00:02.500
(Oliver) Previously on Mighty Med ...

00:02.583 --> 00:05.709
The Annihilator and I are
best evil friends forever.

00:05.792 --> 00:07.917
Let me go and I'll take you
to the quantum chip.

00:08.000 --> 00:09.583
What was that pill? Tell us!

00:09.667 --> 00:13.417
We have to stop the Annihilator
from getting that superhero information!

00:15.000 --> 00:16.709
Someone must have
tunneled out of here.

00:17.917 --> 00:19.125
(Kaz) Megahertz!

00:19.208 --> 00:21.417
Buddy, I love
what you've done with the cell.

00:22.417 --> 00:24.917
This is the Chamber
of Certain Destruction!

00:27.917 --> 00:30.792
I can't believe we're gonna be
melted into action figures!

00:30.875 --> 00:33.917
Man, I hope the kid that buys us
doesn't make us kiss!

00:35.166 --> 00:37.709
Can't you use your electricity
to blast out the force field?

00:37.792 --> 00:40.000
Nope. The Chamber neutralizes

00:40.083 --> 00:42.125
the powers of the prisoner
they put inside it.

00:42.208 --> 00:43.917
I'm as weak as you are!

00:44.000 --> 00:46.208
If you ignore
my incredible muscles.

00:46.917 --> 00:49.625
(man over P.A.)
Commence meltdown process.

00:49.709 --> 00:51.125
(squeals)

00:54.667 --> 00:57.667
I hate this power!
It's so embarrassing!

00:57.750 --> 01:01.166
I mean, how am I supposed
to pick my nose now?

01:04.291 --> 01:07.917
Of course! The cell is only set
to neutralize Megahertz's powers

01:08.000 --> 01:09.291
but Alan's still work.

01:09.375 --> 01:11.750
Alan, if you can transform
into a mouse,

01:11.834 --> 01:14.208
you can fit through the food
slot and get us out of here.

01:14.291 --> 01:15.750
But I haven't mastered
my power yet!

01:15.834 --> 01:18.542
I never know what animal
I'm going to turn into.

01:18.625 --> 01:20.667
Okay, watch it!

01:21.917 --> 01:24.333
(man over P.A.)
Thirty seconds to meltdown.

01:24.417 --> 01:26.542
Alan, you can do it!
You just have to concentrate.

01:29.417 --> 01:30.583
Well, come on already!

01:30.667 --> 01:32.041
(screams)

01:32.125 --> 01:33.583
(loud crash)

01:35.375 --> 01:38.083
(whale calling)

01:38.166 --> 01:40.291
(coughing)

01:40.375 --> 01:42.208
That was incredible!

01:42.291 --> 01:44.583
Alan turned into a blue whale!

01:44.667 --> 01:47.750
Did you know its tail is actually as wide
as a soccer net, and--

01:47.834 --> 01:49.959
Oh, shut your blow hole, Oliver!

01:52.458 --> 01:54.375
You too, Moby Dick!

Now what?
Without a mouth, he can't tell us

02:46.125 --> 02:47.542
where to find the quantum chip.

02:47.625 --> 02:50.583
Also he looks really, really weird.

02:53.041 --> 02:54.667
I suppose we could force
him to write down

02:54.750 --> 02:55.959
where the quantum chip is.

02:56.041 --> 02:58.000
Good idea.

02:59.834 --> 03:02.542
Ahh, you can never find
a pen when you need one.

03:03.750 --> 03:05.291
I wouldn't worry about it.

03:11.583 --> 03:13.875
Wait a minute. This isn't my mouth.

03:13.959 --> 03:16.959
I could never roll my tongue
like this before.

03:20.458 --> 03:24.625
Aha! I just injected myself
with a lying serum.

03:24.709 --> 03:26.125
No matter what you ask me,

03:26.208 --> 03:28.000
I will not be able to tell you the truth.

03:29.583 --> 03:31.709
Ha ha ha ha ha!

03:31.792 --> 03:32.959
What's so funny?

03:33.041 --> 03:34.917
This is an anti-lying serum.

03:35.667 --> 03:37.667
Why did they write "anti" so small?

03:37.750 --> 03:40.083
I mean, that's a pretty
important detail!

03:42.083 --> 03:44.125
Now he can only tell us the truth.

03:44.208 --> 03:45.458
This is bad.

03:45.542 --> 03:48.375
And also I'm wearing a diaper.
I'm potty-trained. I just like them.

03:51.542 --> 03:54.375
Megahertz, your electricity powers
shouldn't be blocked anymore.

03:54.458 --> 03:57.000
Can you use them to boot
the signal on my cell phone?

03:57.083 --> 03:58.375
Why should I help you?

03:58.458 --> 04:01.583
Yeah, Oliver, because of us
he's been in prison twice.

04:01.667 --> 04:02.750
To be honest, I'm surprised

04:02.834 --> 04:04.625
he's not trying to
electrocute us right now.

04:04.709 --> 04:06.875
That's even better
than what I had in mind.

04:06.959 --> 04:08.625
Good plan, Kaz. Thanks.

04:09.542 --> 04:12.000
I have an idea, Kaz. No more ideas.

04:12.875 --> 04:15.667
No, look. Megahertz,
you have to help us.

04:15.750 --> 04:16.875
We just saved your life.

04:16.959 --> 04:18.375
That's gotta count for something.

04:25.250 --> 04:27.333
-(phone beeps)
-There!

04:27.417 --> 04:29.500
But don't tell anyone I helped you

04:29.583 --> 04:31.709
or I'll hunt you down and destroy you.

04:31.792 --> 04:33.500
Actually, I'll probably
do that anyway.

04:33.583 --> 04:37.834
You tell anyone, I'll make sure
it, like, really hurts.

04:40.667 --> 04:42.375
(touchtones beep)

04:44.959 --> 04:45.959
Hello.

04:46.041 --> 04:47.250
Yes, Oliver.

04:48.417 --> 04:50.333
No, I'm sorry, I'm very busy right now.

04:51.250 --> 04:55.083
Well, if you must know
I am collecting empty bottles

04:55.166 --> 04:56.542
for the 5 cent deposit.

04:57.125 --> 04:58.917
Yes, I know I'm a billionaire,

04:59.000 --> 05:02.625
but now I'm a billionaire plus $10.

05:05.792 --> 05:06.625
Right.

05:07.291 --> 05:08.834
Okay, I'll get the Crystal of Kreln

05:08.917 --> 05:11.500
and round up as many
superheroes as I can ASAP.

05:11.583 --> 05:13.875
Excuse me, do you think you
could hurry up with that?

05:13.959 --> 05:14.917
I'm in a bit of a rush.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.500
Good, good, good.
Thank you.

05:18.041 --> 05:20.917
-Great news, guys.
-(goofy laughter)

05:23.208 --> 05:26.750
-Kaz, what are you doing?
-Check it out.

05:26.834 --> 05:29.166
This is the actual Machete Man,

05:29.250 --> 05:32.417
which is kind of cool
and gross at the same time.

05:33.542 --> 05:36.458
Ohh! Ooh, he's still warm.

05:39.875 --> 05:40.875
Time's running out

05:40.959 --> 05:42.583
and if we don't get
those superhero files

05:42.667 --> 05:45.959
before Skylar and the Annihilator do,
it'll spell disaster.

05:46.041 --> 05:48.166
No one can spell disaster!

05:48.250 --> 05:50.083
D-E-Z? D-I-Z?

05:50.166 --> 05:52.083
It's impossible!

05:52.834 --> 05:54.291
But I do know where the files are.

05:54.375 --> 05:56.333
My Uncle Horace transferred
them to a quantum chip

05:56.417 --> 05:57.375
and I know where he hid it.

05:57.458 --> 05:59.750
Great. All right, let's go.

05:59.834 --> 06:04.250
Actually, Kaz, I was thinking that
Alan and I should go get the chip,

06:04.333 --> 06:07.041
-and you should stay here.
-Why?

06:07.125 --> 06:10.917
To, um, h-hold down the fort.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.792
'Cause you, my friend,

06:12.875 --> 06:15.709
are the best
fort-holder-downer I know.

06:17.625 --> 06:19.583
Sounds to me like
he's trying to ditch you.

06:19.667 --> 06:21.000
And I should know.

06:21.083 --> 06:23.500
I've been ditched many, many times.

06:26.458 --> 06:27.417
You're ditching me?

06:27.500 --> 06:28.917
No, no, no, no.

06:29.000 --> 06:32.041
I mean, it's just sometimes
when you're over there,

06:32.125 --> 06:33.709
it's like, "Yeah!"

06:33.792 --> 06:37.000
And when you're over here,
it's like, "Well, uh-oh."

06:41.667 --> 06:43.291
Fine. Yeah, I get it.

06:43.375 --> 06:45.291
If you don't want me
to come, I won't come.

06:45.375 --> 06:47.750
But let's see how well you
do without me by your side.

06:48.417 --> 06:51.041
I'm sorry, but we gotta go.

06:52.959 --> 06:56.458
Hey, look, Kaz, I know things
seem grim for you right now,

06:56.542 --> 06:58.500
but just always remember:

06:58.583 --> 07:00.917
I don't care.

07:09.750 --> 07:11.583
Hi, I'd like to buy the Crystal of Kreln.

07:11.667 --> 07:15.125
Sorry, I'm very busy.
I'm filling in my employee evaluation.

07:15.208 --> 07:17.792
What would you say
is my worst weakness?

07:17.875 --> 07:20.125
Wait. Does my worst weakness

07:20.208 --> 07:22.750
mean my best strength
or biggest weakness?

07:22.834 --> 07:24.625
Well, I'd have to say
your biggest weakness

07:24.709 --> 07:26.959
is either reading comprehension
or customer service.

07:28.083 --> 07:29.709
I'll just put down both.

07:30.500 --> 07:31.959
Look, I'm in a big hurry

07:32.041 --> 07:34.792
and it's extremely important
that I get the Crystal of Kreln.

07:34.875 --> 07:37.291
You don't want the Crystal of Kreln.

07:37.375 --> 07:40.875
What you want is this portrait of me.

07:40.959 --> 07:43.333
What is wrong with you?

07:43.375 --> 07:45.750
Look, is there someone else
here that can help me?

07:45.834 --> 07:48.750
No, but we are taking applications.

07:49.583 --> 07:52.083
Now what would you say
is your worst weakness?

07:55.333 --> 07:56.625
Go, Alan, hurry.

07:56.709 --> 07:58.709
Hey, hey, I'm trying.

07:58.792 --> 08:00.041
I was a whale 5 minutes ago.

08:00.125 --> 08:02.125
I still have barnacles on my thighs.

08:03.166 --> 08:04.291
Where is the quantum chip?

08:04.417 --> 08:06.625
We have to find it before
Skylar and the Annihilator do.

08:06.709 --> 08:08.500
Fine, it's in here.

08:10.166 --> 08:11.625
And so are they.

08:13.250 --> 08:14.500
Uncle Horace!

08:14.583 --> 08:17.125
Is that my nephew Zachary?

08:17.208 --> 08:19.041
No, it's me, Alan.

08:19.125 --> 08:20.792
Oh. Hey, Alan.

08:22.208 --> 08:23.959
Where is the quantum chip?

08:24.041 --> 08:25.792
I swear I hid it in this room.

08:25.875 --> 08:27.750
Also, I don't wear pajamas to bed.

08:27.834 --> 08:29.291
I wear a tuxedo.

08:32.834 --> 08:34.125
Anti-lying serum?

08:34.208 --> 08:35.250
Yes.

08:35.333 --> 08:37.750
Which is why I'm announcing
that that black remote

08:38.458 --> 08:39.792
over there has a locate button

08:39.875 --> 08:41.792
that attracts the
quantum chip like a magnet.

08:42.834 --> 08:44.125
Also, I have a third nipple.

08:44.792 --> 08:46.709
Luckily, it's right on
top of my second nipple,

08:46.792 --> 08:47.959
so no one will ever know.

08:49.500 --> 08:51.250
Thank you.

08:51.333 --> 08:52.834
And gross.

08:56.959 --> 08:58.375
What are you doing?

08:58.458 --> 08:59.625
I'm attracted to you.

09:01.834 --> 09:04.542
No, I mean, I'm really
attracted to you.

09:04.625 --> 09:08.000
What he's saying is he loves you.

09:08.750 --> 09:12.542
No, I'm saying the magnet
in the remote is pulling me in.

09:13.417 --> 09:16.625
(Kaz whimpering)

09:20.333 --> 09:22.750
Kaz, I asked you
to wait in Mighty Max.

09:22.834 --> 09:25.333
Yeah. I decided
to come here instead

09:25.417 --> 09:27.750
because this is how
I go places on purpose!

09:28.750 --> 09:31.917
They must have eaten the quantum chip
to keep you from getting it.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.792
We didn't eat the quantum chip.

09:33.875 --> 09:36.041
We ate a potato chip we found
in the chair cushion.

09:36.125 --> 09:38.291
That was the quantum chip.

09:38.375 --> 09:41.959
He made it look like a potato chip
to disguise it as something unimportant.

09:42.041 --> 09:44.750
But why make it taste like
sour cream and onion?

09:44.834 --> 09:46.875
As opposed to what?
Honey mustard?

09:46.959 --> 09:48.917
Only a madman would
make a quantum chip

09:49.000 --> 09:50.458
taste like honey mustard.

09:51.458 --> 09:53.750
Well, we broke it in half,

09:53.834 --> 09:55.834
so it's useless now.

09:55.917 --> 09:56.917
(Horace) Not true.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.709
Quantum chips are easily
put back together.

09:58.792 --> 10:00.250
And I sneeze like a lady.

10:01.834 --> 10:03.750
Yeah, well, we ate the chip,

10:03.834 --> 10:05.125
so there's no way to get it back.

10:05.208 --> 10:07.208
Unless we rip open your stomachs

10:07.291 --> 10:09.542
and pull it out
before you can digest it.

10:09.625 --> 10:11.834
I was just about to say that.

10:11.917 --> 10:14.083
Hey, great minds think alike.

10:17.291 --> 10:21.208
This is awful.
It smells like whale in here.

10:23.667 --> 10:25.417
(dainty sneeze)

10:32.792 --> 10:35.917
Well, Oliver, this is it for us.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.917
But before we go,
one thing I have to say...

10:39.917 --> 10:41.542
This is all your fault!

10:42.417 --> 10:44.083
Are you kidding me?

10:44.166 --> 10:46.709
You've been helping
the villains all day.

10:46.792 --> 10:48.667
You're like a wood-boring beetle

10:48.750 --> 10:50.500
who lies dormant inside a tree

10:50.583 --> 10:53.875
and then structurally destroys
it by boring its way out.

10:53.959 --> 10:55.709
Talk about boring.

10:57.667 --> 11:00.417
Hey, I know you're evil,
but do you have to be mean?

11:03.625 --> 11:06.208
How can you possibly
think this is my fault?

11:06.291 --> 11:09.792
We wouldn't be in this situation
if we hadn't discovered Mighty Med,

11:09.875 --> 11:12.375
which wouldn't have happened
if you hadn't made me read comic books.

11:12.458 --> 11:14.625
I did not make you read comic books.

11:14.709 --> 11:16.041
Oh, really?

11:16.125 --> 11:18.625
At my fifth birthday party
I wished for a pony.

11:18.709 --> 11:21.417
But you blew out my candles.
So I never got my wish.

11:21.500 --> 11:23.583
If I had, I wouldn't have
been hanging out with you

11:23.667 --> 11:24.792
at the comic bookstore.

11:24.875 --> 11:26.709
I would have been
out riding my pony,

11:26.792 --> 11:28.625
which would have
been a horse by now!

11:30.875 --> 11:32.208
You know what?

11:32.291 --> 11:34.750
These are probably
our last few moments alive.

11:34.834 --> 11:37.500
Could you just be quiet
and let me die in peace?

11:37.583 --> 11:39.417
Not until I say one last thing.

11:40.375 --> 11:41.625
Oatmeal.

11:43.750 --> 11:44.709
What?

11:44.792 --> 11:48.208
My pony's name would
have been Oatmeal.

11:50.250 --> 11:51.375
Now I am done.

11:54.166 --> 11:57.917
You are the most incompetent
store manager I have ever met!

11:58.834 --> 12:00.333
Does incompetent
mean handsome?

12:01.792 --> 12:03.500
I'll just find the crystal myself.

12:03.583 --> 12:06.458
Hey, hey, hey. Slow down.

12:06.542 --> 12:08.250
You don't work here yet.

12:17.208 --> 12:18.500
The Crystal of Kreln.

12:18.583 --> 12:20.333
Thank goodness. I'll take it.

12:21.208 --> 12:23.000
Sorry, it's already been sold.

12:23.083 --> 12:24.333
To who?

12:24.417 --> 12:25.333
To me.

12:25.417 --> 12:27.583
Apparently,
it's very in demand right now.

12:27.667 --> 12:30.875
In fact, someone was just in
here a minute ago asking for it.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.542
That was me!

12:37.208 --> 12:39.875
Look, just give me the crystal

12:39.959 --> 12:41.875
and I will pay
you handsomely for it.

12:41.959 --> 12:45.166
You mean you'll pay me
incompetently for it.

12:45.250 --> 12:48.208
Look, if you give me the crystal,

12:48.291 --> 12:51.166
I will give you my very
expensive sports car.

12:52.041 --> 12:55.709
I'm rich -- I have every material thing
I could ever want.

12:55.792 --> 12:57.166
Except a lemur.

12:57.250 --> 12:58.917
Mother says they shed.

13:00.834 --> 13:02.583
What's in that garbage bag?

13:02.667 --> 13:05.709
Oh, you don't want this.
It's just full of 5 cent deposit bottles.

13:06.375 --> 13:09.625
You didn't say you had a bag
full of collected recycling bottles.

13:09.709 --> 13:12.375
I have the world's biggest
collection of collection bottles

13:12.458 --> 13:14.291
that other people have collected.

13:14.375 --> 13:15.625
I'll give you the stupid crystal

13:15.709 --> 13:17.875
for that bag of collected
collectibles for my collection.

13:18.917 --> 13:20.375
Sure. Take it.

13:24.125 --> 13:25.250
Joke's on him.

13:25.333 --> 13:27.750
I actually collect empty garbage bags.

13:27.834 --> 13:29.709
Psh! What a sucker.

13:38.166 --> 13:40.500
We need to get the quantum chip
out of their stomachs.

13:40.583 --> 13:42.709
Use your exploding power
to blow them open.

13:42.792 --> 13:44.792
Exploding them
might destroy the chip.

13:44.875 --> 13:46.083
And it'll make a mess.

13:46.166 --> 13:48.583
I mean, not everyone here
is wearing a helmet.

13:50.417 --> 13:52.709
Actually, the easiest thing
would be to cut us open

13:52.792 --> 13:54.625
with the laser dissector
on the table over there.

13:54.709 --> 13:57.291
Yes, that would get the job done
quickly and painlessly.

13:57.375 --> 13:59.125
Well, painlessly for you two.

13:59.208 --> 14:00.709
For the boys,
it's gonna be brutal.

14:05.375 --> 14:08.083
So, any last words?

14:09.375 --> 14:10.250
"Oatmeal."

14:15.375 --> 14:16.959
You're pointing it the wrong way.

14:17.041 --> 14:19.709
Horace is full of anti-lying serum.

14:19.792 --> 14:21.291
What's your excuse?

14:23.208 --> 14:24.959
Horace, is Kaz telling the truth?

14:25.041 --> 14:27.417
Yes, and I shave my armpits.

14:31.625 --> 14:32.500
(grunts)

14:49.458 --> 14:51.500
It wasn't a laser dissector.

14:51.583 --> 14:52.959
It was a forestation ray.

14:53.041 --> 14:56.792
Yes, and my anti-lying serum
wore off 2 minutes ago.

14:56.875 --> 14:58.667
I don't shave my armpits.

14:58.750 --> 14:59.792
I wax them.

15:02.375 --> 15:03.959
So that was a trick?

15:04.041 --> 15:05.166
You're a genius.

15:05.250 --> 15:07.959
Look, I'm sorry for saying
that you always mess things up.

15:08.041 --> 15:09.250
Can you forgive me?

15:10.125 --> 15:11.583
Enchanté.

15:12.834 --> 15:14.625
Maybe genius was too strong a word.

15:15.583 --> 15:17.542
Forestation ray only lasts
a few minutes.

15:17.625 --> 15:19.792
We have to get the quantum chip
out of you and hide it.

15:19.875 --> 15:22.250
But how? Do you have a vomit ray?

15:22.333 --> 15:24.917
No, but I have two-week-old
Indian food in my office.

15:26.542 --> 15:27.834
Not yet.

15:33.458 --> 15:35.041
Where are they?

15:35.125 --> 15:35.959
Hey, Annihilator.

15:36.041 --> 15:37.750
Why don't you pick on
someone your own size,

15:37.834 --> 15:40.333
who's also a handsome
yet frugal billionaire?

15:41.583 --> 15:43.250
How did you break my force field?

15:43.375 --> 15:45.083
Crystal of Kreln.

15:45.166 --> 15:47.667
You were a fool
to come here, Titanio.

15:47.750 --> 15:49.250
It's two against one.

15:49.333 --> 15:51.125
Or is it?

15:57.250 --> 15:58.917
I think that was their cue.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.583
No, wait. It was "I beg to differ."

16:00.667 --> 16:02.458
Skylar, can we take this
whole thing over again?

16:02.542 --> 16:03.917
You say, you were a fool
to come here.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
It's two against one-- Whoa!

16:06.083 --> 16:07.333
I beg to differ!

16:25.208 --> 16:26.834
(grunting)

17:15.250 --> 17:17.917
I hate throwing up.
I have the worst taste in my mouth.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.542
At least you have your own mouth.

17:20.834 --> 17:21.959
We don't have much time.

17:22.041 --> 17:23.709
Where are you gonna hide
the quantum chip?

17:24.375 --> 17:26.250
The safest place imaginable.

17:31.667 --> 17:33.959
And now to lock it.

17:58.458 --> 18:00.333
I can't hold them off much longer.

18:05.125 --> 18:07.333
Skylar, you're outnumbered.
You have to give up.

18:07.417 --> 18:08.333
Never!

18:08.959 --> 18:11.542
Hey, how do you get out of here?

18:11.625 --> 18:13.709
Seriously, this place is like a maze!

18:13.792 --> 18:14.750
Whoa!

18:15.834 --> 18:17.250
I'm a good guy now.

18:17.333 --> 18:19.583
I helped Oliver and Kaz
break out of Mighty Max.

18:20.291 --> 18:22.083
Unless you guys have
a brilliant way out of this.

18:22.166 --> 18:24.000
Then I'm totally on your side.

18:28.667 --> 18:31.208
I wish I could go back in time
and do everything differently.

18:31.291 --> 18:33.375
In Issue 72,
Rewind discovered that

18:33.458 --> 18:36.000
if his powers were amplified
with an electrical force,

18:36.083 --> 18:38.792
he could travel further back to whatever
time he was thinking about.

18:39.875 --> 18:42.458
Megahertz, I do have
a brilliant way out of this.

18:44.041 --> 18:45.875
Zap this canister.

18:48.041 --> 18:49.291
(Skylar) I'm reversing time.

19:05.166 --> 19:06.917
Amazing.

19:07.000 --> 19:09.542
I've never seen such a complete
restoration of powers.

19:09.625 --> 19:11.208
Skylar, I need to run
some tests on you.

19:11.291 --> 19:12.917
Okay, but first,

19:13.000 --> 19:15.125
can I have a moment alone
with the Annihilator?

19:15.208 --> 19:17.417
I have some choice words for him.

19:17.500 --> 19:19.542
Would you like to borrow
my thesaurus?

19:19.625 --> 19:23.834
I recommend villain, knave,
scoundrel or no-goodnik.

19:32.041 --> 19:34.458
You turned back time-- very clever.

19:34.542 --> 19:36.375
Now they have no idea I'm evil.

19:36.458 --> 19:37.875
So we can work together in secret

19:37.959 --> 19:40.041
to turn all those superheroes
into villains.

19:40.125 --> 19:41.542
Good plan.

19:41.625 --> 19:43.417
We have to let them
lock you up in Mighty Max,

19:43.500 --> 19:45.041
so they don't suspect anything.

19:45.125 --> 19:49.166
I like that part less...but okay.

19:49.959 --> 19:52.709
-Oh, and I'm sorry about this.
-About what?

19:54.750 --> 19:57.208
And that's for trying
to hurt my friends!

19:57.792 --> 19:59.208
Isn't she amazing?

20:00.208 --> 20:02.834
I guess. I'm more into bad girls.

20:09.709 --> 20:12.750
Even though Skylar's powers
have been successfully restored

20:12.834 --> 20:14.583
and we've captured the Annihilator,

20:14.667 --> 20:16.542
we should probably hide
the quantum chip

20:16.625 --> 20:19.208
somewhere more secure,
just to be careful.

20:21.000 --> 20:22.291
Here it is.

20:22.375 --> 20:23.834
Can I see it?

20:23.917 --> 20:24.750
No!

20:27.583 --> 20:28.834
Don't move!

20:29.542 --> 20:32.875
Now I have to figure out
which one is the quantum chip.

20:34.625 --> 20:37.959
Ugh! Honey mustard.
Alan, have I taught you nothing?

20:38.041 --> 20:39.291
No, you hasn't.

20:39.375 --> 20:42.875
You hasn't home-schooled I
in seventy-twelve days!

20:44.709 --> 20:45.583
Wait.

20:45.667 --> 20:48.458
I have a remote control
that can find the chip.

20:49.667 --> 20:51.625
And I think it's this one.

21:01.250 --> 21:03.583
That was an inopportune
choice of buttons.

21:04.375 --> 21:05.458
Wait!

21:05.542 --> 21:08.000
Let me push it again
and maybe all the chips will disappear.

21:13.959 --> 21:15.333
I should have seen that coming.

21:18.041 --> 21:20.625
(theme music playing)
