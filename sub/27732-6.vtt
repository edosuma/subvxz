WEBVTT

00:20.478 --> 00:22.605
I could just kick the door in, you know?

00:24.816 --> 00:27.068
Yeah, right. Okay.

00:27.152 --> 00:28.570
Look at it. Are you serious?

00:29.279 --> 00:31.865
-My way, we're definitely getting in.
-Right.

00:31.948 --> 00:34.242
Remember why we're here. Seriously, Frank.

00:44.085 --> 00:45.086
Hell, no.

00:53.094 --> 00:55.138
-No.
-Uncle Teddy sent us.

01:06.733 --> 01:08.151
I need to see the money.

01:16.576 --> 01:19.788
Your way, huh? Let's go get something to eat.

01:35.720 --> 01:36.846
Right this way.

01:37.931 --> 01:38.932
Hey, hey.

01:40.767 --> 01:43.061
That's a heavy door you got there, mister.

01:43.144 --> 01:45.271
It'd take a whole army
to kick that thing down.

01:47.732 --> 01:50.860
All right, I take the money up front.

01:51.569 --> 01:55.240
Three hundred for my time and the studio,
another two hundred for developing.

01:56.032 --> 02:01.746
You own the prints and the negatives.
No Internet, no trace, no cops.

02:03.164 --> 02:04.541
Free to use any of this.

02:05.917 --> 02:09.420
I don't judge, so whatever you wanna do.

02:09.504 --> 02:11.214
-And I mean, whatever--

02:12.549 --> 02:14.050
We're just here to use your shit.

02:18.388 --> 02:19.472
Get to work.

02:21.057 --> 02:22.058
Go.

03:09.022 --> 03:11.608
-No! No! No! No! Please, don't--

03:11.691 --> 03:13.193
No! No!

03:19.908 --> 03:22.327
You like taking pictures
of little girls, huh?

03:23.661 --> 03:26.915
Please. Please, please,
he's gonna kill me.

03:27.540 --> 03:30.627
Please! Don't kill...

03:31.753 --> 03:33.421
I didn't do anything, did I?

03:36.925 --> 03:39.135
-Are you?
-You go wait outside.

03:40.470 --> 03:41.471
Go.

03:45.433 --> 03:49.854
Hey, listen. He's, like, a total creep,
but it still seems a bit borderline.

03:50.521 --> 03:51.773
Even for you.

03:56.444 --> 03:57.445
Hey.

04:01.366 --> 04:03.201
It's your lucky day, asshole.

04:05.745 --> 04:07.205
You're disappointed.

04:07.830 --> 04:08.831
Hey...

04:10.875 --> 04:14.003
I'm touched. Really.

04:15.463 --> 04:16.464
Yeah?

04:18.091 --> 04:21.761
You could always burn the place down
if it makes you feel better.

05:54.437 --> 05:56.981
-Did you break it?
-Oh, I hope so.

06:05.865 --> 06:09.410
Now that we're awake,
why not make the best of it?

06:20.630 --> 06:21.964
Mmm...

06:22.757 --> 06:25.176
Look, I... I gotta get out there.

06:26.135 --> 06:27.220
I know.

06:41.401 --> 06:44.695
-I got the whole room for a week.
-Yeah?

06:44.779 --> 06:48.032
How about you sleep in,
get some room service,

06:48.116 --> 06:49.867
keep it warm till I get back?

06:50.743 --> 06:52.495
I miss your place.

06:52.578 --> 06:55.540
The scrambled eggs you make
and that good toast.

06:55.623 --> 06:57.250
When are you back in?

06:57.333 --> 07:01.629
They can't say. Rodent problem.
The whole block, not just mine.

07:01.712 --> 07:04.173
It's gonna take a while, they said.

07:05.216 --> 07:09.345
On second thought,
I'm enjoying hotel living.

07:16.561 --> 07:19.730
-Are you gonna be here when I get back?
-Mmm-hmm.

07:41.294 --> 07:42.378
Got any word for me?

07:42.962 --> 07:44.172
Not a word, brother.

07:46.799 --> 07:48.217
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

07:50.011 --> 07:52.054
Just like Mom never used to make.

07:54.974 --> 07:57.602
Here you go.
Come here a sec, all right?

08:10.698 --> 08:13.409
Holy shit.

08:18.456 --> 08:20.500
Hell, Curtis,
I can even read the board now.

08:21.667 --> 08:24.045
"Today's special... chili."

08:25.588 --> 08:28.132
I guess I knew that,
but it's nice to be sure, man.

08:28.216 --> 08:29.509
Yes, it is.

08:30.176 --> 08:31.135
Um...

08:33.638 --> 08:34.931
Curtis, I just...

08:36.849 --> 08:38.476
Man, I can't even...

08:41.604 --> 08:44.941
You're welcome.
Now you can see where you're going, right?

08:45.024 --> 08:46.025
Hell, yeah.

08:46.609 --> 08:49.153
Now you have no excuse
not to fill out those papers I gave you.

08:49.237 --> 08:51.781
And maybe we can get you
out of living in your car.

08:51.864 --> 08:53.658
One thing at a time, man.

08:53.741 --> 08:55.535
-Right now...

08:55.618 --> 08:58.079
...I'm gonna go over there
and eat my chili.

10:33.924 --> 10:36.344
Hi. Yes, I was just waiting
to speak with, um...

10:37.094 --> 10:39.513
Yes. Oh, wow. Thank you so much.

10:39.597 --> 10:42.933
Seriously, you have no idea how awful
it is being the second assistant.

10:43.893 --> 10:46.937
Um, yes, so I...
Just really quickly, I wanted to, um...

10:47.021 --> 10:49.899
I wanted to triple-confirm
Mr. Poloznev's usual breakfast time

10:49.982 --> 10:53.110
and, like, triple-delay
my inevitable firing.

10:54.612 --> 10:56.947
Perfect. Oh, thank you so much.
You've been so helpful.

10:57.031 --> 10:59.492
What's your name? Deb.
Okay, I'm Ashley.

10:59.575 --> 11:01.702
And I'm sure we'll be speaking again soon.

11:02.620 --> 11:04.580
Cool, cool. Thanks. Bye.

11:07.333 --> 11:08.834
"Cool, cool," huh?

11:10.127 --> 11:14.632
So, Poloznev's a creature of habit.
Gets breakfast with his kid every morning.

11:14.715 --> 11:17.593
You know, I bet he wakes up every day
and pats himself on the back

11:17.677 --> 11:19.428
for being such a special parent.

11:24.558 --> 11:26.227
God, kids are a weakness.

11:32.692 --> 11:33.693
Let's go.

11:37.113 --> 11:40.366
This place costs $40,000 a year,
just for tuition.

11:44.036 --> 11:47.456
I'm sure they all come out
as well-rounded, decent human beings.

11:50.584 --> 11:53.254
Yeah, maybe we'll see
if we can get you a spot, huh?

11:54.714 --> 11:56.215
Sign you up for the glee club.

11:57.007 --> 11:59.343
Yeah, you might as well just shoot me now.

12:00.010 --> 12:03.597
Only someone who's never been shot
would say something stupid like that.

12:03.681 --> 12:06.559
Okay, fair.

12:13.357 --> 12:16.235
Is this what you would have wanted
for Lisa, if you could?

12:18.446 --> 12:20.156
Send her someplace like this?

12:25.870 --> 12:27.288
Yeah, I don't know. I...

12:29.999 --> 12:31.584
I don't really think about it.

12:34.295 --> 12:36.797
-You don't think about her?
-I always think about her.

12:38.382 --> 12:40.468
But she's gone, so...

12:46.348 --> 12:47.892
You should think about her.

12:50.895 --> 12:55.149
You should think about who she'd be now.
Let her live in your head.

12:56.817 --> 12:59.320
Happy. Doing stuff.

13:00.780 --> 13:01.989
You know?

13:05.201 --> 13:06.660
How old would she be by now?

13:14.960 --> 13:16.587
Next month's her birthday.

13:21.801 --> 13:22.927
She'll be...

13:29.642 --> 13:31.894
She'd be 15. Yeah.

13:33.729 --> 13:34.855
Oh, man. Wow.

13:36.065 --> 13:38.442
Yeah, well,
she'd be doing stuff, all right.

13:39.360 --> 13:42.363
But you'd be in so much trouble by now.
Trust me.

13:42.446 --> 13:44.365
She'd be scaring the life out of you.

13:45.282 --> 13:49.286
You know, she'd be going out
and boys knocking on the door...

13:49.370 --> 13:50.496
All of that.

14:03.843 --> 14:05.302
You think they know?

14:06.303 --> 14:08.305
Some of their parents kill people?

14:19.567 --> 14:20.776
I made tea.

14:22.862 --> 14:25.739
-That's what you drink, right?
-Yeah.

14:28.784 --> 14:30.494
It's good. Just how I make it.

14:31.912 --> 14:34.582
I suspect you don't miss much,
do you, Billy?

14:37.459 --> 14:38.586
Hey, uh...

14:39.628 --> 14:43.424
look, earlier,
I wasn't spying on you or anything.

14:43.507 --> 14:45.217
That's not what I'm talking about.

14:46.510 --> 14:49.346
What

14:49.972 --> 14:51.807
Well, you made sure I couldn't miss that.

14:53.225 --> 14:56.353
I'm guessing you wanted me to hear
your whole healer shtick.

14:57.897 --> 14:59.481
You take too many risks.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.735
Your behavior is self-destructive.

15:05.154 --> 15:08.115
So, what,
you're trying to transform me, too?

15:08.198 --> 15:09.199
That it?

15:10.659 --> 15:12.703
I just think everyone is worth saving.

15:13.704 --> 15:16.874
Even you. Even if you don't.

15:17.458 --> 15:19.168
Well, I got nothing left to lose.

15:20.920 --> 15:22.004
You do.

15:23.631 --> 15:26.050
So why take the risk? I mean, that...

15:27.927 --> 15:30.804
that seems kind of self-destructive.

15:33.682 --> 15:36.101
So whatever this is, it's not, uh...

15:37.186 --> 15:40.439
It's not all about me, is it?

15:43.776 --> 15:45.235
Where were you last night?

15:48.906 --> 15:52.242
I had a drink with Jake.
Couple drinks, in fact.

15:52.326 --> 15:54.912
Did talking to someone
with similar issues help you?

15:54.995 --> 15:56.038
I guess.

15:57.081 --> 16:00.334
Jake knows how it is.
We got things in common.

16:04.505 --> 16:06.131
Please don't leave here again.

16:11.011 --> 16:12.262
And what if I do?

16:14.890 --> 16:16.058
Don't get caught.

16:51.468 --> 16:54.596
Wow. This place is really something.

16:57.182 --> 17:00.185
You got four walls and heat.
What do you need?

17:00.811 --> 17:03.480
Loss of curiosity
is a loss of humanity, Frank.

17:03.564 --> 17:07.860
Yeah, well, I know where the exits are.
Curiosity satisfied.

17:09.236 --> 17:10.571
Where'd you get that?

17:11.572 --> 17:12.573
Curtis.

17:15.409 --> 17:16.493
I should have a gun.

17:16.577 --> 17:20.080
A gun by itself is worthless
if you don't know how to use it.

17:20.164 --> 17:22.374
Last time I gave you one,
you didn't do shit.

17:23.751 --> 17:25.002
You could teach me.

17:31.550 --> 17:32.676
All right, kid.

17:33.594 --> 17:36.472
Tell you what. Empty gun, empty clip.

17:40.225 --> 17:41.518
You can have mine.

17:42.352 --> 17:43.729
-Yeah?
-Oh, yeah.

17:44.688 --> 17:46.065
If you can take it from me.

17:47.524 --> 17:50.444
Oh, that's really cute.

17:52.613 --> 17:55.491
-Now, that was cute.

17:58.327 --> 17:59.328
Again, huh?

18:05.667 --> 18:08.629
Uh-oh. You don't know what you're doing.
Come here, sit.

18:09.213 --> 18:10.756
-Ready to sit down?

18:19.556 --> 18:23.393
Or you could just show me
the right way to do it.

18:28.023 --> 18:30.067
Get up. Come on.

18:32.402 --> 18:34.279
-Keep your distance, okay?
-Mmm.

18:34.363 --> 18:38.450
you're gonna
take the gun off line, right?

18:38.534 --> 18:40.953
-Off line, right? Push hard. Show me.
-Mmm-hmm.

18:41.036 --> 18:42.037
Attagirl.

18:42.121 --> 18:44.081
Easy. Easy.

18:44.164 --> 18:46.291
go for that wrist, all right?

18:46.375 --> 18:48.293
Get control. Go. Now look. Underneath.

18:48.377 --> 18:50.087
-Yeah? Underneath.
-Okay.

18:50.170 --> 18:52.422
Go for the joint. Joints are weakest.

18:52.506 --> 18:54.091
Yeah, especially in old dudes.

18:54.174 --> 18:55.092
-Yeah?

18:55.175 --> 18:56.885
Easy. Bang, bang. Listen to me.

18:56.969 --> 18:59.847
Use your legs, get underneath and twist.

18:59.930 --> 19:00.931
Okay.

19:04.059 --> 19:05.144
-Look at that, huh?

19:05.227 --> 19:07.146
-Who got a gun?
-Yeah. Yeah.

19:07.688 --> 19:10.065
-Attagirl! Who's got a gun?
-I got a gun.

19:10.149 --> 19:11.817
Yeah, you got a gun.
It feels good, huh?

19:11.900 --> 19:12.734
Yeah.

19:14.403 --> 19:16.780
you just took a gun off somebody
who wanted to use it on you.

19:16.864 --> 19:17.990
What do you do?

19:21.368 --> 19:22.536
You use it on them.

19:23.287 --> 19:25.080
I don't care who they are.
You do not hesitate.

19:25.164 --> 19:26.707
You pull that trigger. You got it?

19:28.876 --> 19:30.836
Good. Show me.

19:47.936 --> 19:50.147
-Hey.

19:51.190 --> 19:54.026
Attagirl. Way to go.

20:00.073 --> 20:02.576
I bet you were a really good dad, huh?

20:03.243 --> 20:05.495
You ever, like, teach Lisa any of this
or anything?

20:21.929 --> 20:24.890
Anytime I come here,
I'm gonna call your name, okay?

20:24.973 --> 20:28.977
So you hear somebody out there that
doesn't call, you just take the shotgun,

20:29.561 --> 20:30.687
you let loose.

20:31.647 --> 20:33.523
You hit the hatch. You run like hell.

20:34.107 --> 20:35.108
You clear?

20:36.318 --> 20:37.319
Yeah.

20:41.949 --> 20:42.950
Crystal.

21:18.402 --> 21:22.781
Under arrest, in hospital care,
Russo is forced to seek help.

21:22.864 --> 21:27.536
But I can't help imagining what would be
if I had been able to intervene earlier.

21:28.412 --> 21:31.581
Billy reminds me of KM, so much.

21:32.416 --> 21:33.875
If I can reach him...

21:35.794 --> 21:38.297
I sometimes wonder why
the stronger the man,

21:38.380 --> 21:41.758
the less able they are to admit their pain
and ask for help.

21:42.509 --> 21:45.304
I look at BR, and it breaks my heart.

22:15.792 --> 22:17.127
Don't even think about it.

22:21.506 --> 22:22.841
Eject the magazine.

22:26.595 --> 22:27.679
Round, too.

22:42.444 --> 22:43.820
That because of me?

23:03.298 --> 23:05.175
The lawyers told me that I shot you.

23:05.884 --> 23:07.010
And I don't...

23:09.805 --> 23:11.223
I don't remember that.

23:16.186 --> 23:20.148
I wanted to call you,
after I found out, to say...

23:21.691 --> 23:26.154
to say... something.

23:30.242 --> 23:32.202
I know you came to visit me once.

23:36.748 --> 23:39.626
Would you believe me
if I told you that I was sorry?

23:40.627 --> 23:43.463
Sorry enough to turn yourself in
and pay for it?

23:50.220 --> 23:51.346
Oh...

23:52.556 --> 23:54.266
Oh, I paid already.

23:58.854 --> 24:00.147
Don't you think?

24:03.859 --> 24:05.610
I'm never going back, Curtis.

24:08.071 --> 24:09.739
So anyone who comes at me...

24:11.032 --> 24:13.535
it will be all or nothing, do you hear me?

24:16.204 --> 24:21.126
Now, a little birdie told me
that you've been asking about me.

24:22.794 --> 24:23.879
And in here...

24:24.588 --> 24:26.256
In here, me and you...

24:28.008 --> 24:31.595
we're still brothers,
man, so...

24:32.804 --> 24:38.852
So all... All this... All this

24:41.730 --> 24:43.190
Now, I need you to tell me...

24:47.861 --> 24:49.321
how did this happen to me?

24:54.075 --> 24:55.076
Hmm?

24:56.661 --> 24:59.414
How did this happen to me?!

25:03.126 --> 25:04.127
Just...

25:05.212 --> 25:06.838
Just tell me.

25:09.090 --> 25:11.510
Who did this to me, man?

25:18.183 --> 25:20.018
I wish I could tell you, Billy.

25:36.493 --> 25:38.119
I was never gonna hurt you, man.

26:42.809 --> 26:44.561
What

27:35.945 --> 27:38.031
-Who is it?
-Mahoney.

27:47.749 --> 27:52.003
At least this time you didn't shoot me.
That's progress. May I come in?

27:52.087 --> 27:53.254
What do you want with me?

27:53.338 --> 27:55.256
I was hoping you can help me
with a couple things.

27:55.340 --> 27:58.635
Devil's in the details, right?
And you know my case better than anyone.

27:58.718 --> 28:00.428
Oh, it's all in my statement.

28:00.512 --> 28:03.390
Yeah. I'm surprised you'd just hand over
a collar on something this big.

28:03.473 --> 28:05.266
Anyway, everything lines up super tight,

28:05.350 --> 28:08.269
like, let's be honest, these things
never do. Except maybe medical records--

28:08.353 --> 28:10.522
Is there a question coming anytime soon?
'Cause I gotta go.

28:10.605 --> 28:12.649
Who's the third man at the carousel?

28:14.818 --> 28:15.819
Uh...

28:19.072 --> 28:20.532
I don't follow.

28:20.615 --> 28:21.741
I was just wonderin'

28:21.825 --> 28:25.245
how Billy Russo managed
to shoot you in the head

28:25.328 --> 28:26.955
after you'd messed him up so bad

28:27.038 --> 28:28.665
he almost choked to death
on his own blood.

28:28.748 --> 28:30.583
Well, it's all in my statement.

28:30.667 --> 28:32.711
I don't think you're capable
of something like that.

28:32.794 --> 28:35.630
What -Not cruel enough.

28:35.714 --> 28:40.176
But we both know someone who is.
Someone who hated Billy Russo.

28:40.260 --> 28:43.972
-So, what, is that a question?
-You look scared to me, Dinah.

28:44.055 --> 28:47.308
I think you're holding on
about as tight as anyone I've ever seen.

28:47.392 --> 28:51.855
What is it they say

28:51.938 --> 28:52.939
Oh...

28:53.898 --> 28:57.152
Did you get a discount on fortune cookies
or something, Mahoney?

28:58.570 --> 29:00.989
I talked to the kids at the carousel.

29:01.072 --> 29:02.657
I was sneaky, though.

29:02.741 --> 29:05.493
I told 'em I was there
to make sure they'd kept their word,

29:05.577 --> 29:07.787
not told anyone about the third man.

29:09.372 --> 29:11.207
The guy with the skull on his vest.

29:13.793 --> 29:15.003
Look, uh...

29:15.962 --> 29:18.423
-it's all in my--
-"In my statement." Yeah.

29:19.007 --> 29:22.177
Hmm. It's a shame
you won't trust me with the truth.

29:25.221 --> 29:26.222
Look...

29:27.390 --> 29:31.144
I know I'm a pain in the ass,
but I'm an honest cop.

29:32.687 --> 29:36.691
And I think maybe, before all this,
you were an honest cop, too.

30:01.549 --> 30:02.842
Just be a second.

30:03.426 --> 30:05.678
-Hey!

30:15.313 --> 30:18.650
The first chair
is a position of leadership.

30:19.400 --> 30:21.486
-You should be proud.
-Thank you.

30:25.990 --> 30:28.117
Our specials are on the first page.

30:32.080 --> 30:34.207
I didn't realize
they were still in season.

30:35.625 --> 30:37.126
If you know where to look.

30:49.138 --> 30:50.348
Stay put.

30:51.391 --> 30:52.725
Stay put.

32:00.418 --> 32:01.461
Hey, how are you?

32:02.545 --> 32:04.172
Uh, just the usual, please.

32:15.934 --> 32:16.935
Thanks.

32:25.568 --> 32:26.694
See you tomorrow.

33:11.280 --> 33:13.700
Clocked you at the cafe, asshole!
Who are you?

33:13.783 --> 33:14.784
Talk!

33:15.493 --> 33:18.037
Relax. We have a mutual acquaintance
from Ohio.

33:19.163 --> 33:20.373
Frank Castle?

33:21.958 --> 33:24.293
Would you prefer Peter Castiglione?

33:26.045 --> 33:28.506
A man has to earn a new life,
Agent Madani.

33:29.048 --> 33:30.258
A new identity.

33:32.010 --> 33:33.845
What did Castle do to earn his?

33:36.264 --> 33:38.266
I can keep your secret.

33:38.349 --> 33:40.393
If you tell me where to find him.

33:40.476 --> 33:41.728
And the girl.

33:46.607 --> 33:49.068
Maybe I arrest you now, huh?

33:49.944 --> 33:51.320
See what shakes loose?

33:53.114 --> 33:54.449
On what charge?

33:57.201 --> 33:59.328
Guilt and shame will eat you alive, Dinah.

34:00.079 --> 34:02.915
Unless you face your actions before God
and truly repent.

34:06.544 --> 34:08.296
I'm sure we'll speak again soon.

34:09.172 --> 34:10.798
You're an easy woman to find.

34:18.097 --> 34:19.098
Damn.

34:29.275 --> 34:31.569
Stop! Stop! Don't clean anything.

35:07.688 --> 35:08.689
Get out.

35:10.733 --> 35:13.778
-In the building.

35:20.743 --> 35:21.744
Fate.

35:24.705 --> 35:26.999
When I was a boy, I saw a man...

35:27.875 --> 35:31.295
walked into the woods
at the end of a shotgun much like this.

35:33.256 --> 35:36.050
This man had abused
another man's daughter.

35:37.927 --> 35:41.472
I was maybe 12 years old,
but my father made me come to see...

35:42.807 --> 35:44.976
to understand justice.

35:47.186 --> 35:51.566
That day,
that man's blood still red in the snow,

35:51.649 --> 35:55.069
I vowed to never be the man
at the other end of the gun.

35:57.780 --> 36:00.533
My father wanted
me to learn about justice.

36:02.743 --> 36:04.620
Instead, I learned about power.

36:07.582 --> 36:08.708
And here I am.

36:10.793 --> 36:11.794
So...

36:13.713 --> 36:14.881
fate.

36:18.009 --> 36:21.637
You want to make God laugh,
show him your plans.

36:22.180 --> 36:25.933
I don't believe in God.
My own arrogance brought me here.

36:28.060 --> 36:31.189
I didn't think you would come after me,
even after you killed Kazan.

36:35.318 --> 36:36.944
I didn't kill Kazan.

36:39.655 --> 36:41.157
Maybe fate has sense of humor.

36:41.240 --> 36:46.370
If you didn't kill Kazan, the same people
coming after you are coming after me.

36:46.913 --> 36:49.749
Fate makes us allies, not enemies.

36:51.292 --> 36:54.170
Anderson and Eliza Schultz.
You know the names?

36:55.087 --> 36:56.088
No.

36:56.172 --> 36:57.840
Testament Industries.

36:58.883 --> 37:04.555
Factories, oil and chemicals, and farming.
All over this great country of yours.

37:06.182 --> 37:11.062
Soon enough, nations will play
second fiddle to corporations, Mr. Castle.

37:12.438 --> 37:15.149
The Schultzes plan to run America Inc.

37:19.278 --> 37:21.781
You think a couple photos
are gonna change that?

37:22.657 --> 37:27.078
The photos you recovered are of their son,
David Schultz.

37:28.204 --> 37:30.206
Impressive young man.

37:31.207 --> 37:35.836
All his life, his parents have been
grooming him to become the next president.

37:37.672 --> 37:39.090
There's only one problem.

37:39.924 --> 37:42.176
David prefers the company of men.

37:43.928 --> 37:45.012
So what?

37:45.763 --> 37:51.185
If his orientation doesn't sink him,
the fact that they hid it and lied would.

37:55.398 --> 37:59.819
What's in it for you

37:59.902 --> 38:03.572
Oh, we don't want to stop him.
We want to own him.

38:05.324 --> 38:08.369
I can pay you handsomely
for the photographs

38:09.870 --> 38:12.790
and make sure you and the girl
get safely out of country.

38:16.794 --> 38:18.212
Call me old-fashioned.

38:19.547 --> 38:21.090
I don't work with Russians.

38:22.341 --> 38:23.592
On your knees.

38:30.308 --> 38:31.225
Go on.

38:31.767 --> 38:32.768
That's it.

38:44.280 --> 38:46.240
I would ask one favor. Not in the face.

38:47.575 --> 38:49.035
That man in the woods...

38:50.244 --> 38:53.748
they made sure his mother
didn't recognize anything she buried.

38:55.666 --> 38:58.085
I would spare my wife
and daughter that at least.

39:07.345 --> 39:08.387
Your daughter.

39:09.388 --> 39:10.389
How old?

39:12.224 --> 39:13.559
Almost 17.

39:17.688 --> 39:18.898
Does she know?

39:20.441 --> 39:23.235
The shit you do, does she know?

39:23.319 --> 39:24.320
No.

39:26.614 --> 39:29.158
Isn't that what we all want, Mr. Castle?

39:30.451 --> 39:33.037
To give our children
better life than we had?

39:34.121 --> 39:36.874
Natalia, she plans to be a musician.

39:39.210 --> 39:41.003
Violin.

39:43.839 --> 39:45.466
I love to watch her play.

39:51.597 --> 39:54.600
You take your family. You get out of town.
You never come back.

40:02.983 --> 40:04.568
Thank you, Mr. Castle!

40:04.652 --> 40:06.278
I didn't do it for you.

40:07.363 --> 40:10.199
I see you back in America again,
I'll pay you a visit.

40:19.166 --> 40:20.584
You work with them.

40:21.419 --> 40:23.712
What's up, boys Anybody need anything?

40:23.796 --> 40:26.048
No, we got you. We got you. This is José.

40:26.132 --> 40:28.676
Hey, man. Billy. What's up

40:31.512 --> 40:33.180
Anyway, I got along with them.

40:33.764 --> 40:37.601
"Hearts and Minds" is kind of bullshit,
but if you're making people laugh,

40:38.269 --> 40:39.395
they're not gonna shoot you.

40:39.478 --> 40:42.857
I want every print from every piece.
Partials, too.

40:44.066 --> 40:46.360
Run them all through AFIS
and then through NGI.

40:47.653 --> 40:49.363
-Can you--
-It's classified.

40:52.950 --> 40:54.869
I've been waiting my whole life for this.

41:03.586 --> 41:05.254
-Hmm. Okay.

41:06.005 --> 41:08.090
Guys! Guys, you gotta help me.

41:08.174 --> 41:11.677
They're taking my car. I'm getting towed.
My whole life is in that car.

41:15.723 --> 41:17.183
Oh, come on!

41:17.266 --> 41:18.350
Shit.

41:19.685 --> 41:21.061
Shit. Look, man...

41:27.151 --> 41:30.529
Bobby, José, follow him.
We'll flank him and cut him off.

41:30.613 --> 41:32.072
-You two.
-Let's go. Come on.

41:47.004 --> 41:48.172
Let's go.

41:58.724 --> 42:00.684
Hey! Get off there. What are you--

42:01.352 --> 42:02.853
Hey!

42:04.480 --> 42:07.775
Get off me. What are you doing?
Get your hands off me.

42:08.484 --> 42:10.194
Bastard! Get off me.

42:11.278 --> 42:15.616
Now, you can either stop fighting
and shut up or I will break you in half.

42:16.200 --> 42:19.662
You're crazy. Get off me, you freak.

42:31.173 --> 42:33.175
-Whoa, whoa, whoa!
-Take it easy, man.

42:35.219 --> 42:36.470
Shit.

42:38.472 --> 42:41.809
Jimbo, I hope you
remembered your keys.

42:56.490 --> 42:58.200
Now, you need to get out of town.
You hear me?

42:58.284 --> 43:00.119
Change those plates and drive to Texas.

43:00.202 --> 43:01.787
'Cause if they don't get you
on the plates,

43:01.870 --> 43:03.747
they'll get you on the VIN
if you stay in New York.

43:03.831 --> 43:06.375
You got it. Thanks, guys.

43:07.585 --> 43:09.545
I mean it. Thanks.

43:10.879 --> 43:12.006
Good luck, man.

43:16.635 --> 43:20.848
Damn, Billy. That was easy.
We did that easy.

43:20.931 --> 43:23.601
-How good did that feel?
-Pretty damn good.

43:23.684 --> 43:26.562
-You guys moved pretty well.
-Yeah, like riding a bicycle.

43:26.645 --> 43:28.981
We're wasting our time
in that bar every night.

43:29.064 --> 43:31.900
We should be doing jobs,
working protection, something like that.

43:31.984 --> 43:34.153
Make some money,
get some juice while we're at it.

43:34.236 --> 43:35.654
Right. Why work for someone else?

43:35.738 --> 43:39.241
A crew like this?
We should rob a bank or something.

43:41.535 --> 43:42.828
I know a place.

43:53.589 --> 43:56.091
So, Poloznev was right
about the Schultzes.

43:57.676 --> 44:01.263
They're buying Congress, basically,
just one small piece at a time.

44:02.306 --> 44:05.476
They run these alt-right websites,
and they use them to make up scandals

44:05.559 --> 44:09.188
and rat-punk their opponents.
And none of it's even illegal.

44:09.688 --> 44:14.360
Oh, but killing all my friends, because
two gay dudes kissed at a funeral...

44:17.738 --> 44:18.989
Jesus Christ.

44:19.615 --> 44:20.741
What?

44:23.160 --> 44:26.705
Your friends died because they got
involved with a blackmail scheme.

44:26.789 --> 44:30.626
I mean, what do you think happens
when you play games like that?

44:30.709 --> 44:33.087
Lives get ruined. They get ended.

44:33.754 --> 44:35.214
I didn't want that to happen.

44:35.297 --> 44:38.384
So what

44:38.467 --> 44:40.594
You make a choice.
You live with the consequences.

44:40.678 --> 44:42.137
-The consequences?
-That's right.

44:42.221 --> 44:45.224
-You mean you kill them?
-You're goddamn right.

44:45.307 --> 44:47.518
You do realize that makes you
just like them, right?

44:47.601 --> 44:49.561
You're the one
who wanted to play with guns.

44:55.651 --> 45:00.072
All right. You told me to fight,
and that's exactly what I'm doing.

45:00.155 --> 45:02.282
I'm just trying
to make myself useful here.

45:04.827 --> 45:06.537
You know what? Forget it.

45:06.620 --> 45:09.331
-Christ.
-Whatever. Think about it.

45:10.040 --> 45:11.667
You know everything I do now.

45:12.376 --> 45:15.713
If I were to get caught up,
nothing changes for you. Nothing.

45:15.796 --> 45:17.381
I'm a pain in the ass anyway, right?

45:17.464 --> 45:19.007
-You told me that often enough.
-Hey...

45:19.091 --> 45:21.260
Whichever way this goes,
you don't need me.

45:21.343 --> 45:22.928
Okay, look, look, look, just...

45:25.389 --> 45:27.433
don't talk that way, all right?

45:28.851 --> 45:29.852
Sit down.

45:30.894 --> 45:31.937
Sit down!

45:35.482 --> 45:36.483
Please.

46:01.508 --> 46:05.471
Look, I know I'd be dead
if it weren't for you killing people.

46:05.554 --> 46:06.680
I get that.

46:10.559 --> 46:13.061
I just... I really hate this.

46:14.021 --> 46:15.022
You know?

46:16.190 --> 46:19.860
I wish... I wish I could
go back and change it.

46:21.361 --> 46:22.488
I mean, don't you?

46:24.907 --> 46:27.075
If you could go back and change it,
wouldn't you?

46:33.332 --> 46:34.958
I was shit-faced.

46:35.042 --> 46:38.420
I saw him taking my car and then the guys
just went into action, man. Boom!

46:38.504 --> 46:39.963
It was done before I knew it.

46:40.839 --> 46:42.800
Jake's buddy,
the dude with the messed-up face,

46:42.883 --> 46:44.384
he told me to take off.

46:44.468 --> 46:46.929
I was driving to Texas.
Just like I was told.

46:49.348 --> 46:51.058
I was gonna change the plates first,

46:51.141 --> 46:55.479
but I parked and I just caught a quick nap
so no one would pull me over for drinking.

46:56.688 --> 46:57.564
And then...

46:57.648 --> 47:01.527
And then they caught me at the curb,
and, man, I'm just...

47:03.237 --> 47:05.864
We're gonna find a place
for you to crash somehow, all right?

47:08.909 --> 47:11.578
Jake's buddy, who was he?

47:11.662 --> 47:13.789
Uh... uh... uh...

47:13.872 --> 47:17.292
Billy somebody. A marine, I think.

47:20.379 --> 47:23.090
I didn't tell the cops
about anyone else who was there.

47:24.883 --> 47:26.718
Did I do right, Curtis?

47:26.802 --> 47:29.721
I figured it wouldn't help me
get my car back.

47:29.805 --> 47:30.806
No.

47:37.771 --> 47:38.856
Sit tight.

47:44.653 --> 47:47.489
Look at me.
Don't tell them anything, all right?

47:49.199 --> 47:51.118
Cool.

48:35.913 --> 48:37.039
A subpoena.

48:37.122 --> 48:39.750
Covers anything
with Billy Russo's name on it.

48:39.833 --> 48:43.378
Medical records, art projects,
love notes...

48:45.130 --> 48:47.716
Have you always wanted to be
in law enforcement, Sgt. Mahoney?

48:51.261 --> 48:53.597
I saw an astrologer once...

48:53.680 --> 48:56.767
Doesn't sound very scientific.
For a doctor.

48:57.351 --> 48:59.353
-It was a birthday gift.
-Hmm.

49:00.270 --> 49:01.396
He mentioned something

49:01.480 --> 49:06.401
about how the natal charts of criminals
and cops were nearly identical.

49:06.944 --> 49:10.197
Same planets in the same places.

49:10.280 --> 49:13.867
The expression of those aspects diverges,
of course, because...

49:13.951 --> 49:15.827
environment and childhood.

49:15.911 --> 49:21.583
control.

49:22.292 --> 49:26.588
Control over actions.
Control over consequences.

49:27.255 --> 49:28.799
Control over other people.

49:29.549 --> 49:32.552
But, mostly, they craved
control over themselves.

49:32.636 --> 49:33.720
Yeah?

49:34.304 --> 49:37.182
If people could control themselves,
I'd be out of a job.

49:37.265 --> 49:38.809
Probably you, too.

49:40.435 --> 49:42.062
I require a receipt for that.

49:44.690 --> 49:47.484
I don't know why you're
so overprotective of this guy.

49:48.068 --> 49:51.863
If we can't find the best in others,
how can we hope to find it in ourselves?

49:53.865 --> 49:55.742
And people say I'm idealistic.

49:56.451 --> 49:58.203
Well, here's your receipt.

49:59.496 --> 50:01.707
-Good night.
-Good night.

50:36.324 --> 50:38.285
I should have told him you were here.

50:40.037 --> 50:43.498
What would you have done

50:44.082 --> 50:45.333
Would you have killed him?

50:46.585 --> 50:47.669
Probably.

50:53.300 --> 50:55.010
I'm a criminal now.

50:55.886 --> 50:57.596
A criminal harboring a criminal.

50:58.430 --> 50:59.806
A murderer.

51:01.808 --> 51:03.143
I know better.

51:07.272 --> 51:09.066
I know better.

51:10.484 --> 51:11.610
You think...

51:12.652 --> 51:15.197
You think that I would hurt you

51:17.199 --> 51:18.700
You have poor impulse control.

51:18.784 --> 51:21.578
Yes. Yes, I do. I do.

51:22.704 --> 51:23.914
Not like you.

51:23.997 --> 51:25.624
You know nothing about me.

51:26.583 --> 51:29.211
Did you think there was gonna be
some kinda happy ending to all this?

51:29.294 --> 51:30.128
There's not.

51:30.837 --> 51:33.006
All the therapy in the world
can't make that happen.

51:33.090 --> 51:36.009
Shit, you don't seem
that happy yourself, Krista.

51:36.093 --> 51:37.636
I've been around here a little bit.

51:38.929 --> 51:41.348
Seems to me
like you don't have much of a life.

51:41.431 --> 51:43.391
My emotional state is not your--

51:43.475 --> 51:45.727
What are you trying to control here, huh?

51:45.811 --> 51:47.562
Is it yourself

51:47.646 --> 51:50.315
Because that is never gonna happen.
It's never gonna happen!

51:50.398 --> 51:52.651
-You need to calm down, Billy.
-Who's KM?

51:55.529 --> 51:57.948
What

51:58.031 --> 51:59.908
Some other pet project of yours?

51:59.991 --> 52:02.119
Some other poor bastard
you've been trying to control?

52:02.202 --> 52:05.664
I'm guessing that didn't end too well.
How many have there been

52:05.747 --> 52:06.623
What number am I?

52:44.035 --> 52:46.705
Curtis! Curtis, what is going on?
If you know where Russo is,

52:46.788 --> 52:49.833
you could've told me. I'd already have
a team kicking down his door by now.

52:54.838 --> 52:57.674
Oh, that is just peachy.
I thought I told you to leave town.

52:57.757 --> 52:59.551
Yeah, I had shit to do.

52:59.634 --> 53:01.595
Yeah? Well, your shit
ended up on my shoe today.

53:01.678 --> 53:05.390
I've had Mahoney up my ass.
And who the hell is this guy, huh?

53:05.473 --> 53:07.058
-He came at you?
-Yeah, he came at me.

53:07.142 --> 53:08.894
-So why don't you tell me--

53:09.311 --> 53:12.606
Whatever it is you two are talking about,
you do it on your own time.

53:12.689 --> 53:13.773
Take a seat.

53:17.319 --> 53:18.904
Thought you didn't know where he was?

53:19.738 --> 53:21.489
I could say the same about you.

53:25.202 --> 53:26.494
I found Billy.

53:27.704 --> 53:31.124
He's rolling with some vets.
A couple of them go to my group.

53:31.208 --> 53:33.126
He rolled up on me yesterday.

53:33.210 --> 53:35.253
He's crazy. You can see it.

53:36.338 --> 53:38.089
He said he's never going back inside.

53:38.673 --> 53:42.135
So if a couple of cops
go to try arrest him,

53:42.802 --> 53:44.054
people are gonna die.

53:45.889 --> 53:49.893
The last few days,
I let men live that I should have killed.

53:50.644 --> 53:51.645
And it...

53:53.688 --> 53:55.232
It pisses me off.

53:55.315 --> 53:56.733
Jesus, you are unreal.

53:56.816 --> 54:00.654
As far as that maniac on your phone,
that's my problem and I'll deal with it.

54:00.737 --> 54:01.821
I give you my word.

54:01.905 --> 54:04.824
No, Frank. No.
You can't fight a war on two fronts.

54:05.742 --> 54:09.621
We deal with Billy Russo first,
and everything else comes after.

54:10.288 --> 54:11.915
You want your lives back.

54:13.208 --> 54:14.334
I get it.

54:16.544 --> 54:20.423
So I'm gonna find Bill
and I'm gonna end it.

54:21.800 --> 54:23.426
I'm gonna do it my way.

54:24.844 --> 54:26.972
And you gotta be right with that.
