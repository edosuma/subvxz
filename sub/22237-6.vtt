00:00.365 --> 00:02.418
Is there a spell in here
that can get us home?

00:03.495 --> 00:05.312
You have to do something
for me first.

00:05.333 --> 00:07.524
If he helps me find Alice,
she can get you home.

00:07.545 --> 00:11.726
<i>The remaining boys are now thought to be
suspects in Andy Lau's disappearance.</i>

00:11.747 --> 00:13.478
Is that Forest Roland?

00:13.499 --> 00:16.820
No beard, a suit...
He's not Hermit Guy in this universe.

00:16.843 --> 00:18.737
You're an Earth Element!

00:18.784 --> 00:22.273
I'm confused. If Saskia's Earth, then
why did the tracking spell work?

00:22.294 --> 00:23.715
It's glowing, like before.

00:24.421 --> 00:27.965
Ellen was outside the classroom.
The missing Element's Ellen!

00:27.986 --> 00:29.733
What is going on, Felix?

00:29.754 --> 00:32.442
We need you to come with us...
to help find Andy.

00:32.463 --> 00:35.818
I've reworked the unmaking spell so
we can travel between the universes.

00:36.033 --> 00:39.048
So we're going to do a spell
to go to another universe?

00:39.069 --> 00:41.240
The same universe we were in
when we went missing.

00:41.261 --> 00:43.162
I hope that crazy isn't contagious.

00:43.183 --> 00:47.329
Earth, Water, Fire, Air!

Season 2, Episode 6

01:36.276 --> 01:39.276
Synced by Reef
addic7ed.com

01:46.981 --> 01:48.788
- Are we there?
- "There"...?

01:48.809 --> 01:51.189
- What are you talking about?
- I'm not sure.

01:51.210 --> 01:55.254
It's your backyard, Felix! The same one
we were in one second ago.

01:56.875 --> 01:58.834
What about that enormous storm?

01:58.855 --> 02:01.666
The one that was there,
and then now it's completely gone.

02:01.687 --> 02:03.475
Nobody else thinks that's weird?

02:03.496 --> 02:06.338
That's the mind-blowing weirdness
of being in another universe.

02:06.359 --> 02:10.762
<i>If</i> we are in another universe.
Felix, did it work?

02:15.997 --> 02:19.968
This universe might look the same,
but it isn't the same. Trust me.

02:19.969 --> 02:23.132
So this is what crossing
universes looks like. Impressive.

02:23.153 --> 02:25.160
Just prepare
to have your tiny mind blown.

02:25.181 --> 02:26.358
Look!

02:28.148 --> 02:30.084
It's Oscar's Valtirian cruiser.

02:33.714 --> 02:36.615
Oh, is that the spaceship
that transported us here?

02:36.636 --> 02:40.466
THIS belongs to Oscar, the other Oscar.
The one who belongs here.

02:45.140 --> 02:48.353
See, it worked!
It's Oscar's room, not mine.

02:50.368 --> 02:53.672
- Which proves what, exactly?
- That we're in another universe.

02:53.986 --> 02:56.744
Of course,
why didn't I think of that?

02:57.745 --> 02:59.950
Come on, we've gotta find Andy.

02:59.971 --> 03:03.686
Er, hate to be a downer, guys, but what
about the incredibly powerful demon

03:03.707 --> 03:06.214
that wants to restore us
<i>out</i> of this universe?

03:06.235 --> 03:09.262
This so isn't funny.
I'm going home.

03:09.283 --> 03:12.881
I wouldn't worry about it, Sam.
That demon was only after Felix, remember?

03:13.037 --> 03:14.457
Hilarious.

03:14.952 --> 03:17.551
Come on, we've got to move fast.

03:18.529 --> 03:20.276
Stay together.

03:27.988 --> 03:29.721
Come on, Mia.

03:34.769 --> 03:37.741
Ellen, wait!

03:38.467 --> 03:42.654
We need to stay together. It's our
only protection in this universe.

03:42.675 --> 03:46.028
Newsflash, Felix - you changed
bedrooms, not universes!

03:46.049 --> 03:48.273
Come on, Ellen.
I wouldn't lie to you.

03:48.294 --> 03:50.729
No, you tell me the truth
about everything.

03:51.009 --> 03:55.539
Anyway, I've gotta be in a chat room -
"Goths To A Flame". Remember, Felix?

03:55.573 --> 03:59.114
That's where we hung out
when we were friends.

04:01.430 --> 04:03.225
Come on, man.

04:08.709 --> 04:10.689
Where's the key?

04:19.878 --> 04:21.485
I don't get it.

04:25.625 --> 04:28.389
Shouldn't we be checking
Andy's house? The restaurant?

04:28.410 --> 04:29.749
What about the school?

04:29.770 --> 04:31.699
Why, so you can see
if Mia still likes you?

04:31.720 --> 04:34.787
No, Andy might have come back
to see his girlf...

04:34.829 --> 04:37.897
Um, I mean, you know,
his special friend.

04:38.146 --> 04:41.244
That uber-nerd has "a special friend"...?

04:44.510 --> 04:46.613
Great, no signal.

04:46.969 --> 04:48.798
Where are you going?

04:48.973 --> 04:52.988
Somewhere there's better reception,
so I can call my mum, and get a key.

04:53.462 --> 04:55.004
Felix...

04:58.806 --> 05:00.673
The demon knows we're here.

05:00.694 --> 05:03.452
We'll come with you!
You can use my phone.

05:03.473 --> 05:05.064
Let's find Phoebe.

05:06.836 --> 05:08.276
Good riddance.

05:08.297 --> 05:09.741
Phoebe!

05:10.042 --> 05:11.594
What...?

05:11.933 --> 05:16.246
- All this time, and not even a postcard?
- By all this time, you mean a week?

05:16.267 --> 05:19.520
Well, I missed you guys...
vaguely.

05:20.405 --> 05:22.380
We need your help to find Andy.

05:22.401 --> 05:24.408
He went home with you.
Why would he be here?

05:24.611 --> 05:26.566
He did a spell, and disappeared.

05:26.587 --> 05:30.348
- Well, he's supposed to be the smart one.
- Yeah, well, he had a fight with Felix.

05:30.372 --> 05:32.586
None of these are working.

05:32.890 --> 05:35.451
- She came with us.
- How?

05:35.472 --> 05:37.059
Using this.

05:37.335 --> 05:40.032
It opens doors between universes.

05:40.412 --> 05:44.123
- Well, that's pretty advanced magic.
- Oh, please, don't you start.

05:44.144 --> 05:48.175
Oh, dress sense improved,
personality not so much.

05:48.196 --> 05:51.297
You can talk!
Feral, magic shop weirdo.

05:51.318 --> 05:53.657
Why are you chucking this stuff?

05:53.719 --> 05:57.288
Call me crazy, but finding out
your sister is an evil demon...

05:57.309 --> 05:58.770
Kinda puts you off magic.

05:59.097 --> 06:01.878
If she's evil, why are you
opening a taco van with her?

06:01.899 --> 06:05.424
Look, we need to check the hide-out.
Andy might be there.

06:06.277 --> 06:08.373
How about I give you a lift?

06:11.942 --> 06:14.950
I'm going to Mum's work.
I'll see you later.

06:14.971 --> 06:16.974
Ellen, trust me.

06:19.059 --> 06:21.618
I'll show you where we were
when we went missing.

06:21.858 --> 06:24.525
It'll all make sense, I promise.

06:41.315 --> 06:42.671
Andy!

06:42.870 --> 06:45.335
- Andy!
- What is this place?

06:45.356 --> 06:47.947
I told you I'd show you
where we were for two weeks.

06:47.995 --> 06:51.055
- You're kidding?
- Come on, let's check inside.

06:53.665 --> 06:54.931
Hey.

06:56.272 --> 06:58.113
Taco van?

06:58.501 --> 07:02.069
Our universe's Alice
came back when we did.

07:02.668 --> 07:04.993
Is she OK?
Have you spoken to her?

07:05.014 --> 07:07.269
- She's not a demon?
- No, no.

07:08.697 --> 07:13.441
And what about 'that' me?
Must be happy to have her back.

07:13.650 --> 07:14.927
I guess.

07:15.571 --> 07:20.398
I mean, in my universe, you and I,
we don't really talk.

07:22.177 --> 07:27.213
So the other Phoebe's not a caring,
sharing, maternal figure, like me, then?

07:32.842 --> 07:34.809
It's so close to town.

07:34.830 --> 07:38.209
- You could've easily found your way home!
- It wasn't that simple!

07:38.230 --> 07:42.506
- Man, being back here makes me starving.
- Oh, really? Well, have this.

07:43.066 --> 07:44.854
Andy's pawpaw ointment.

07:44.875 --> 07:47.780
Wherever he is, I hope the nerd
doesn't have itchy crotch.

07:47.837 --> 07:50.516
So you were here the whole time?

07:50.517 --> 07:52.656
I'm glad you told me the truth, Felix.

07:52.677 --> 07:55.177
Now I know how selfish and
immature you really are.

07:55.198 --> 07:58.707
Ellen, wait! We are in another
universe, OK? I'll prove it to you.

07:58.728 --> 08:01.262
When we crossed universes,
we got magic powers.

08:01.283 --> 08:05.379
- So now you're superheroes as well?
- Ready? Watch.

08:08.331 --> 08:10.323
Unbelievable.

08:11.855 --> 08:14.264
Interpretive dance, I'm impressed.

08:14.433 --> 08:18.279
- Show them. Sam can make wind.
- Oh, even more impressive.

08:22.413 --> 08:24.208
So stupid...

08:24.229 --> 08:26.911
Felix, check this out.
Chicken feet.

08:26.932 --> 08:30.178
Ha-ha-ha. Still warm, awesome.

08:30.199 --> 08:32.370
- Andy's been here!
- Looks like it.

08:35.205 --> 08:36.717
Where's Ellen?

08:39.279 --> 08:41.592
Falls for that... idiot!

08:46.051 --> 08:47.855
Who are you?

08:50.269 --> 08:52.555
- What are you?
- Detective...?

08:53.888 --> 08:56.634
- What are you doing out here?
- I'm hunting.

08:56.655 --> 09:00.665
- Right, because...?
- Well, that's man's true purpose.

09:00.835 --> 09:02.352
OK...

09:02.498 --> 09:06.039
Look, I found out where the boys were
when they went missing.

09:06.131 --> 09:09.669
Welcome,
the returning heroes!

09:11.332 --> 09:12.776
Tell me it worked, mate.

09:12.797 --> 09:15.441
- You got your friends back home alright?
- Yeah, it worked.

09:15.462 --> 09:17.637
But we think
Andy might have come back here.

09:17.658 --> 09:21.089
- Have you seen him?
- No, not a cracker.

09:21.210 --> 09:24.313
- I'll keep a lookout though.
- Of course, you will!

09:24.334 --> 09:27.361
- You're head of the police investigation.
- Am I?

09:30.339 --> 09:32.054
Chook's feet.

09:32.134 --> 09:35.407
You know, someone's been dropping
them everywhere around here.

09:36.570 --> 09:39.625
- Nainai's restaurant.
- That's where Andy would get them from!

09:39.681 --> 09:41.316
Thanks, Roland.

09:41.642 --> 09:42.988
Ellen...?

09:45.477 --> 09:48.171
- "Roland"...?
- Catch you.

09:56.215 --> 09:58.890
I don't understand why our powers
don't work in this universe.

09:58.911 --> 10:00.303
I've got a few suggestions.

10:00.324 --> 10:03.478
Maybe it's because the Elements
are against us here, not with us.

10:03.499 --> 10:05.125
Which is why we need to move fast.

10:05.146 --> 10:08.128
You guys look here, I'll check Andy's
place; let's meet at school later.

10:08.149 --> 10:12.298
Nobody thinks it's weird that the
detective was behaving like a hobo?

10:12.386 --> 10:16.612
Oh, yeah, wait, I get it -
we're in another universe.

10:16.820 --> 10:18.000
Sorry, I forgot.

10:18.021 --> 10:20.409
Shouldn't the Roland here
be the same as the one at home?

10:20.410 --> 10:24.161
I definitely prefer this one.
He's a lot less aggro, and he cooks!

10:24.182 --> 10:26.204
- But they should be the same.
- Exactly.

10:26.225 --> 10:29.755
Apart from us, and everything we've
affected, it should all be identical.

10:29.776 --> 10:32.410
- Identical and delusional.
- And it's not, because...

10:32.411 --> 10:34.879
Hello! Enough chit-chat.
Places to be.

10:34.900 --> 10:37.168
- I haven't figured that out.
- Yeah, wow!

10:37.189 --> 10:41.345
Detective Murphy having an alpha
male hobby like hunting is a total shock.

10:41.346 --> 10:44.671
- The man carries a gun for a living!
- Waiting!

10:55.808 --> 10:57.999
I placed offering for ghost boy.

10:58.150 --> 11:01.668
Important you feed ghosts,
or they come back very angry.

11:01.689 --> 11:04.189
So it was you who put
the chicken's feet in the hideout?

11:04.190 --> 11:07.555
- Wherever ghost goes, he must be fed.
- But you haven't seen Andy?

11:07.576 --> 11:08.697
No.

11:08.718 --> 11:11.381
- You're sure?
- You think my eyes no good?

11:11.382 --> 11:14.014
See? 20/20 vision.

11:18.410 --> 11:20.374
Viv...?

11:20.916 --> 11:24.182
- <i>What</i> happened to you?
- What happened to <i>you...?</i>

11:24.938 --> 11:28.329
I'm so glad you're here. You will
not believe where I've just been.

11:28.350 --> 11:32.108
Their whole missing in the forest story?
Full-blown lie!

11:32.129 --> 11:34.682
- Not bad.
- What?

11:34.714 --> 11:37.091
That whole princess perfect thing
you had going on was so...

11:37.112 --> 11:39.868
Listen, Viv! The whole time
they were gone,

11:39.889 --> 11:42.393
they were hiding
in an abandoned shack.

11:42.394 --> 11:45.329
They're up to something.
Something bizarre.

11:45.330 --> 11:47.710
- What are you talking about?
- I know.

11:47.731 --> 11:50.377
Anyway, I'm gonna find out
what really happened to Andy.

11:50.378 --> 11:52.749
Andy? Who'd wanna see
that nutter again?

11:52.770 --> 11:53.985
But...

11:54.006 --> 11:56.191
- That guy was so creepy.
- But he's your...

11:56.212 --> 11:58.247
- Ellen, what are you doing?
- I was just...

11:58.268 --> 12:00.022
Hey, loser,
what are you doing in our kitchen?!

12:00.043 --> 12:03.502
Viv, relax, OK? We're leaving.
We have to go.

12:04.723 --> 12:08.487
You were totally onto something.
I'll let you know what I find out.

12:08.584 --> 12:10.564
Cool makeover, by the way.

12:11.779 --> 12:13.750
What makeover?

12:13.751 --> 12:17.650
<i>Could all class captains please meet
at the principal's office at lunchtime?</i>

12:17.671 --> 12:21.595
Man, I really hope that Sammy loser isn't
here; if I see his smug face, I'm gonna....

12:21.616 --> 12:25.671
- If Andy were here, where would he be?
- Library. Let's check it out.

12:26.634 --> 12:29.242
- What's with her?
- Not sure.

12:29.263 --> 12:32.222
- Felix!
- Hey, Oskie!

12:33.703 --> 12:37.734
- You can walk?
- Oh, Ellen, is it Halloween already?

12:37.735 --> 12:40.847
- That costume's really scary.
- How come you can walk? Since when?

12:40.868 --> 12:43.503
Since I was
11 months and 6 days old.

12:43.850 --> 12:46.085
- No...
- What are you doing?

12:46.106 --> 12:47.938
- What is she doing?
- She's confused.

12:47.959 --> 12:51.178
Right. Are you back for good? I'd be
so cool to have a brother again.

12:51.205 --> 12:53.554
"Again"?! Felix, what's going on?

12:55.254 --> 12:57.774
Look, we're back to find Andy.
Have you seen him?

12:57.775 --> 12:59.445
No, sorry.

12:59.466 --> 13:01.509
- What is this?
- Give that back!

13:01.530 --> 13:04.510
- Oi, leave him alone!
- It's fine, I've got this.

13:06.273 --> 13:07.501
Just give it back!

13:07.510 --> 13:09.198
Way to go, Oskie.

13:13.556 --> 13:16.206
I think we talked about this,
guys, remember?

13:16.227 --> 13:18.930
- You unmade Oscar's accident?
- Yes.

13:18.951 --> 13:21.513
- What, with an operation?
- No, with magic.

13:21.534 --> 13:25.206
- As in rabbit-out-of-the-hat magic?
- I know it sounds crazy...

13:25.227 --> 13:27.882
No, it doesn't <i>sound</i> crazy,
it <i>is</i> crazy!

13:27.903 --> 13:30.634
The thing is, this Oscar
isn't my brother.

13:30.654 --> 13:31.670
What?!

13:31.691 --> 13:33.845
I know, my brains hurt
just thinking about it too.

13:33.866 --> 13:37.146
Felix used a spell that unmade us.
In this universe, we were never born.

13:37.167 --> 13:40.873
Enough! Oscar was walking.

13:40.896 --> 13:43.718
Can somebody
please explain that to me?

13:44.906 --> 13:48.910
Gentlemen, Phoebe told me you boys
had gone back to your folks.

13:50.784 --> 13:53.160
Er, yeah, we did, Mr Bates.

13:53.235 --> 13:57.385
Then what are you doing back here?
Outside of school hours, no less.

13:58.775 --> 14:01.759
We just wanted to come back to...

14:02.799 --> 14:05.448
To...

14:06.574 --> 14:08.545
Try out for netball.

14:09.171 --> 14:11.745
Since when do you boys play netball?

14:14.314 --> 14:17.357
- What position, Jake?
- Wing defence, sir.

14:17.378 --> 14:21.370
Right, and what about you two?
Sam? Felix?

14:23.739 --> 14:27.762
- Ellen... We have to find her.
- Great time for her to disappear. Again.

14:27.763 --> 14:31.528
- Boys...?
- Sorry, Mr Bates. Netball calls.

14:31.779 --> 14:34.735
Hey, hold on. I was talking to you.

14:37.465 --> 14:40.445
Hey, stop. Just...

14:52.239 --> 14:53.819
Afternoon, Phoebe.

14:54.574 --> 14:56.236
Still haven't seen them.

14:56.257 --> 14:58.774
Teenagers don't just
disappear into a forest.

14:58.775 --> 15:01.517
- You'd be surprised.
- Sorry...?

15:01.538 --> 15:06.291
Let it go, Gary. The boys are fine, back
with their parents, like I told you.

15:06.312 --> 15:08.017
What's all this?

15:08.719 --> 15:10.079
Stocktake.

15:10.100 --> 15:13.528
- Looks like you're skipping town.
- What, and leave all this?

15:14.560 --> 15:17.644
- Anything else, Gary?
- I'll see you around.

15:19.295 --> 15:20.776
Good to go.

16:00.411 --> 16:02.177
That's <i>my</i> locker.

16:18.359 --> 16:20.508
Keep it up.

16:28.787 --> 16:30.775
Where did she go?

16:41.373 --> 16:42.773
Come on!

16:43.614 --> 16:45.562
We've got to find Ellen.

16:51.013 --> 16:52.626
Oh, no...

16:56.535 --> 17:00.344
What happens when two of the same
person from different universes meet?

17:00.365 --> 17:02.813
I don't know,
but it can't be good.

17:57.324 --> 17:59.958
I'm Andy's "special friend"?!

18:00.373 --> 18:01.907
Ellen...?

18:04.151 --> 18:07.099
No, this can't be happening...

18:08.363 --> 18:10.958
- Have the boys come back with you?
- What?

18:10.979 --> 18:15.924
- You're me from the other universe, right?
- I'm not you! I'm me.

18:15.945 --> 18:18.622
- We're the same person.
- We're not the same.

18:18.643 --> 18:21.221
You're into blogging and boy bands.

18:21.242 --> 18:25.650
And in your universe, Andy disgusts you,
and your best friend is Felix.

18:26.382 --> 18:29.345
- How did you know that?
- Andy told me.

18:32.322 --> 18:36.646
Felix was right all along.
This <i>is</i> another universe.

18:43.854 --> 18:45.123
No!

18:45.703 --> 18:47.080
You OK?

18:47.101 --> 18:50.711
- This is...
- Seriously... freaky.

18:56.186 --> 18:57.719
Hey, Jake.

18:57.752 --> 19:01.715
The thing about sea monsters is
you can't see when they're coming...

19:03.438 --> 19:06.513
Oh, wow, you're back!
I didn't think I'd see you again.

19:06.534 --> 19:07.897
Did you miss me?

19:07.918 --> 19:12.294
How could I, when I know there's a 'me' in
another universe who's blissfully happy?

19:14.745 --> 19:15.983
What...?

19:16.504 --> 19:19.544
- She dumped you?
- Well, no. Not really.

19:22.251 --> 19:24.666
Yeah, she dumped me.

19:26.258 --> 19:30.044
But what would make you...
I mean, her, happy?

19:31.847 --> 19:34.155
Maybe it's just a timing thing.

19:38.470 --> 19:40.509
I could always say
when a unicorn's coming.

19:40.530 --> 19:43.626
- Right, 'cause they're colourful...
- Of course, they've got a horn.

19:51.549 --> 19:53.335
No way...

20:07.246 --> 20:08.864
Order must be restored!

20:08.885 --> 20:10.094
Felix!

20:19.254 --> 20:23.065
So you haven't lost the plot.
This magic stuff is real.

20:23.098 --> 20:24.468
Who'd have thought, right?

20:24.489 --> 20:28.330
You could've told me I was a semi-pro
netballer with a crush on Andy!

20:28.351 --> 20:31.543
- Don't know why I didn't.
- Come on, Felix, we all know why.

20:31.564 --> 20:34.157
- We do...?
- 'Cause he likes you himself.

20:34.178 --> 20:36.142
I'm still right here...

20:38.405 --> 20:40.412
The demon's taken over
the whole netball team!

20:40.433 --> 20:42.413
- How could you tell?
- You could tell!

20:54.745 --> 20:56.215
What's wrong with them?

20:57.367 --> 20:58.595
I've got this.

21:00.739 --> 21:03.762
Divinity of the Elements,
I summon Thee.

21:03.763 --> 21:06.722
Earth, Water, Fire, Air.

21:06.723 --> 21:09.359
Elements that we all share.

21:12.934 --> 21:14.774
Are you alright?

21:15.205 --> 21:17.205
What did you just do?

21:22.142 --> 21:24.035
It's not supposed to wear off that fast!

21:24.056 --> 21:26.603
Oh, hey, I found
the Book of Shadows...

21:26.707 --> 21:30.321
OK, possessed netballers. And I thought
team sport was character-building.

21:30.342 --> 21:33.010
Phoebe, we can't stop.
Any sign of Andy and the Laus?

21:33.031 --> 21:35.768
Nothing. We need to find
a safe place to get you guys home.

21:35.789 --> 21:38.409
- I know where.
- What is she doing?

21:38.430 --> 21:40.410
Outside, now!

21:42.165 --> 21:43.586
Chase?

21:43.740 --> 21:45.348
Chase.

21:59.438 --> 22:02.658
Maybe the demon's stronger now,
that's why the talisman can't hold it off.

22:02.679 --> 22:05.332
- Phoebe, Jake, wait up!
- Oh, great.

22:05.353 --> 22:06.643
Gary!

22:06.744 --> 22:09.938
- Yeah, I was worried about you guys.
- OK, now's not a good time.

22:09.959 --> 22:13.483
That day in the forest...
What happened? I can't remember.

22:13.504 --> 22:15.261
- No time!
- What's the rush?

22:15.282 --> 22:17.776
We have an entire team
of netballers chasing us.

22:17.797 --> 22:19.677
In your dreams, mate.

22:22.669 --> 22:25.441
Cripes! What's going on there?

22:25.507 --> 22:27.180
You guys better be off.

22:31.535 --> 22:33.057
Just stop right there.

22:33.078 --> 22:35.851
Now, I don't know what you're
playing at, but just cut it out!

22:35.925 --> 22:38.328
- Through him...
- Or around him?

22:38.349 --> 22:39.687
Through him.

22:44.245 --> 22:46.237
What's wrong with you, mob?

22:48.042 --> 22:50.453
- We need to make a circle.
- Grab the sticks!

22:50.474 --> 22:52.098
You have to do something for me
before you go.

22:52.119 --> 22:54.888
We need to get out of here!
Felix, we have to go!

22:54.909 --> 22:57.195
- Sorry, Phoebe.
- We made a pact, Felix!

22:57.216 --> 22:59.377
You get my Alice back.
I want my sister!

22:59.398 --> 23:01.741
- There's no time.
- You promised, Felix!

23:08.829 --> 23:11.712
Divinity of the Elements,
I summon Thee...

23:11.733 --> 23:13.752
Order must be restored.

23:13.806 --> 23:15.702
Sam! Sam!

23:17.358 --> 23:21.349
Through this world, we can see
another place where we can be.

23:21.350 --> 23:23.590
Phoebe, get off him!

23:25.058 --> 23:26.725
Felix!

23:31.079 --> 23:35.145
Take the fire, make it burn.
Take the air, and make it turn.

23:35.166 --> 23:39.728
Take this water and this earth,
and to another world, call us forth.

23:40.076 --> 23:44.019
Take the fire, make it burn.
Take the air, and make it turn.

23:44.040 --> 23:48.769
Take this water, and this earth,
and to another world, call us forth.

23:55.977 --> 23:57.540
Jake!

23:58.161 --> 23:59.743
Where are we?

24:01.358 --> 24:02.790
Jake...?

24:15.326 --> 24:17.868
- How did you get here?
- Is here where I think it is?

24:17.889 --> 24:19.060
Felix is gonna freak.

24:19.081 --> 24:21.919
One day with a normal dad -
why is that so much to ask?

24:21.940 --> 24:24.155
Because he's from another universe, Jake!

24:24.176 --> 24:26.183
Don't you wanna send him home?

24:26.350 --> 24:29.086
- What's got into you today?
- Nothing.

24:29.107 --> 24:32.105
I saw something when we were
coming back. Something in-between.

24:32.126 --> 24:35.330
- Another universe?
- No, it felt...

24:35.351 --> 24:36.583
Different.

24:36.604 --> 24:37.827
Ellen!

24:38.033 --> 24:41.091
- What are you talking to them about?
- Ow, what are you doing?

24:41.112 --> 24:43.260
Have they put you
in some weird magic trance?

24:43.281 --> 24:44.693
Help me!

24:45.961 --> 24:48.992
- That is so cool.
- Well, it must be your power manifesting.

24:49.013 --> 24:51.478
- Sorry, I should have warned you.
- You think?!

24:52.154 --> 24:53.782
Enough with the lightning!

24:53.803 --> 24:55.702
- Water's a conductor, right?
- So?

24:55.723 --> 24:57.726
And you and Andy
are both Water Elements.

24:57.727 --> 25:00.688
It could mean we can use that connection
to communicate with Andy.
