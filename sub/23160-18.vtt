WEBVTT

00:00.014 --> 00:01.630
You got to help me figure
out how to get in there.

00:01.702 --> 00:02.760
Oh, no, we don't.

00:02.836 --> 00:04.862
Besides, I'm dying to know
what he's doing in there.

00:07.408 --> 00:10.002
When he goes
to inject the poison...

00:10.077 --> 00:12.102
leap from the table
and overpower him.

00:12.179 --> 00:13.168
Leap?

00:13.247 --> 00:14.612
Did you see through
his disguise, Watson?

00:14.682 --> 00:15.649
You think, it's...

00:15.716 --> 00:16.705
Moriarty.

00:17.518 --> 00:18.485
Higgins.

00:20.321 --> 00:22.016
I need to know
where the doctor is.

00:22.089 --> 00:24.182
And I need to know
where your friend is.

00:24.258 --> 00:26.249
Pretend you're enjoying it,
Watson.

00:26.894 --> 00:29.021
I wouldn't bother you unless
it was really important-

00:29.096 --> 00:30.085
Higgins!

01:49.627 --> 01:50.616
Higgins?

01:55.266 --> 01:56.426
Higgins!

02:12.083 --> 02:13.072
Higgins.

02:17.354 --> 02:18.719
It's about time.

02:19.523 --> 02:20.512
Higgins...

02:34.672 --> 02:37.436
<i>It is the singular
purpose of this narrative...</i>

02:37.508 --> 02:41.410
<i>to factually present the details of
my detective friend's adventure.</i>

02:41.779 --> 02:43.872
<i>Without bias, in his behalf...</i>

02:43.948 --> 02:47.213
<i>I offer his inferences,
deductions, and solutions...</i>

02:47.451 --> 02:50.181
<i>leaving to the reader
the task of final judgment.</i>

03:04.068 --> 03:06.127
<i>In the spring of 1976...</i>

03:06.203 --> 03:08.364
<i>I was bequeathed
the sad duty of acting as...</i>

03:08.439 --> 03:10.566
<i>executor to Sir Alec Ramsey.</i>

03:22.686 --> 03:25.621
<i>The few that gathered to grant
this knighted veteran...</i>

03:25.689 --> 03:28.055
<i>of Her Majesty's Service
the final courtesy...</i>

03:28.125 --> 03:31.322
<i>were appalled by the tuppenny,
ha'penny turnout.</i>

03:31.929 --> 03:34.989
<i>I, on the other hand, was
not in the least surprised.</i>

03:36.634 --> 03:40.570
<i>As Alec's closest friend, I had
shared his penchant for privacy...</i>

03:40.638 --> 03:45.007
<i>and his belief that friendships are
measured in quality rather than quantity.</i>

03:45.075 --> 03:47.771
<i>Traits that hardly solicit
an army of mourners.</i>

03:50.881 --> 03:54.248
<i>I also understood that we were two
loyal subjects of the Crown...</i>

03:54.318 --> 03:56.650
<i>half a world
removed from England.</i>

03:56.954 --> 03:58.888
<i>And three decades
from Sandhurst.</i>

04:12.136 --> 04:14.934
It was a beautiful
service, Jonathan.

04:15.439 --> 04:18.601
You gave it all such
a genuine touch of home.

04:19.777 --> 04:21.540
Alec would have been pleased.

04:22.379 --> 04:25.837
Agatha, I find praise at this
moment somewhat distasteful.

04:26.350 --> 04:29.319
I simply arranged for the
proper burial of a friend.

04:32.423 --> 04:34.288
Forgive me. I'm sorry.

04:35.459 --> 04:38.053
I'm simply angry with myself
for indulging in...

04:38.128 --> 04:40.494
a frivolous hope
that could not possibly be.

04:43.534 --> 04:45.695
Still, I did so
want the others here.

04:45.803 --> 04:47.100
The others?

04:47.171 --> 04:49.537
Well, one
of us made it, old man.

04:52.643 --> 04:53.632
David.

04:55.846 --> 04:58.542
I arrived shortly before
the end of the service.

05:00.150 --> 05:02.914
But I was awkward at
interrupting your conversation.

05:03.354 --> 05:06.221
I'm frightfully sorry.
Miss Agatha Chumley.

05:06.824 --> 05:07.813
Agatha...

05:08.225 --> 05:12.355
my friend from Sandhurst,
David Worth.

05:13.197 --> 05:14.221
How do you do?

05:14.765 --> 05:16.426
Good heavens, man,
why didn't you let me know?

05:16.500 --> 05:18.661
I would have collected you
at the airport.

05:19.136 --> 05:20.763
He died in his sleep, you say?

05:20.838 --> 05:21.827
What?

05:23.140 --> 05:24.266
Your message.

05:24.775 --> 05:27.005
"Sir Alec Ramsey
passed peacefully."

05:27.077 --> 05:29.511
Oh, yes. Yes, of course.

05:29.580 --> 05:32.413
It was a frightful shock.
No apparent illness.

05:32.516 --> 05:34.711
Only two years my senior.

05:35.252 --> 05:37.015
Well, no good dwelling on it.

05:38.222 --> 05:40.747
More important business at hand.

05:41.025 --> 05:42.117
I beg your pardon.

05:44.795 --> 05:46.194
I'm in need of lodgings.

05:46.263 --> 05:48.629
I'll be eternally in your
debt if you'd direct me to...

05:48.699 --> 05:53.432
some quiet but peaceful
establishment for gentlemen residents.

05:54.538 --> 05:57.871
Why, David, you'll stay with
me, of course, as my guest.

05:57.975 --> 05:59.101
I insist.

05:59.543 --> 06:00.532
Yes.

06:01.178 --> 06:02.907
Perhaps that would be best.

06:04.682 --> 06:07.173
I hope, Miss Chumley, that
we'll be seeing you again?

06:07.851 --> 06:10.319
After pressing
matters are resolved.

06:10.387 --> 06:12.582
David, what are you talking
about? What pressing matters?

06:12.656 --> 06:14.624
Yes, of course.

06:14.692 --> 06:18.321
Good day, Mr. Worth. Jonathan. Agatha.

06:23.200 --> 06:24.531
Well done, man.

06:25.202 --> 06:27.329
How could I have doubted
you'd put the lid on it?

06:30.307 --> 06:33.208
Damn shame.
Alec deserved better.

06:38.082 --> 06:40.016
Well, at least we know
who we're after.

06:40.851 --> 06:42.978
Just a matter
of finding him again.

06:43.287 --> 06:44.914
We're after someone?

06:45.656 --> 06:47.749
You know who it is
as well as I do.

07:04.441 --> 07:06.636
<i>Higgins, I have to
talk to you. Don't hang up.</i>

07:07.711 --> 07:08.700
Higgins?

07:09.680 --> 07:11.511
He hung up. Again.

07:11.582 --> 07:12.913
So, what's the big deal?

07:12.983 --> 07:15.315
Most of the time you're trying
to avoid Higgins anyway.

07:15.386 --> 07:17.547
Seems to me you'd be glad
he's not talking to you.

07:17.621 --> 07:21.182
I have to conduct the surveillance
for a very important client.

07:21.258 --> 07:22.850
Must be the one client
that pays.

07:22.926 --> 07:26.384
And I have to get this 400 millimeter
camera lens that he keeps in there.

07:26.463 --> 07:28.727
Four hundred-
I lost my place again.

07:28.999 --> 07:32.298
I mean, how am I expected to do
my job without the proper tools?

07:32.369 --> 07:33.461
Well...

07:33.537 --> 07:36.165
he's probably busy
working on his memoirs.

07:36.240 --> 07:39.403
Yeah, well, you think he'd come
out long enough to give me the lens.

07:39.476 --> 07:41.137
No, no, no, no, no.
Right now...

07:41.211 --> 07:44.510
he's pinned down somewhere
between Dublin and Burma.

07:45.048 --> 07:47.312
Vicious cannibals to his left.

07:47.384 --> 07:48.874
Wild Irish rebels to his right.

07:48.952 --> 07:51.045
Yeah, and Corky Bostwick
at his side.

07:51.121 --> 07:53.214
Look, I got to get in there
and get that lens.

07:53.290 --> 07:55.724
Besides, I'm dying to know
what he's doing in there.

07:55.793 --> 07:57.055
Guys. Guys.

07:57.127 --> 08:00.096
You think you could talk about
this monumentally important topic...

08:00.164 --> 08:01.927
somewhere else?

08:02.633 --> 08:03.622
No.

08:03.801 --> 08:05.996
We're not going
to talk about it at all.

08:06.069 --> 08:08.469
Yes, we are. You got to help me
figure out how to get in there.

08:08.539 --> 08:11.099
No, I don't.
I'm going windsurfing.

08:11.175 --> 08:12.164
T.C.!

08:12.276 --> 08:16.372
I'm sorry, Thomas. You'll have to figure
this one out all by your lonesome.

08:18.449 --> 08:19.438
Rick?

08:19.683 --> 08:21.480
Thomas, can't you see I'm busy?

08:21.552 --> 08:25.511
I've got to get the figures on this wine
stock into the board meeting tomorrow morning.

08:25.656 --> 08:27.021
Forget the wine.

08:27.991 --> 08:28.980
No.

08:29.059 --> 08:30.526
You're right. Never mind.

08:30.594 --> 08:33.256
Thanks. Bye.

08:38.702 --> 08:39.929
<i>I brought David home...</i>

08:40.003 --> 08:41.903
<i>and made him comfortable
in the guest house.</i>

08:42.206 --> 08:45.471
<i>That was in the days when the
guest house was a guest house.</i>

08:48.479 --> 08:51.448
<i>He continued his vague
references to his theory...</i>

08:51.515 --> 08:54.006
<i>that Alec had met
with foul play.</i>

08:57.621 --> 08:59.953
<i>It was not his only
disarming trait.</i>

09:00.057 --> 09:02.685
<i>I began to notice
that he took on a wry smile...</i>

09:02.759 --> 09:04.556
<i>every time I said his name.</i>

09:04.761 --> 09:07.059
<i>When I asked
for an explanation...</i>

09:07.130 --> 09:09.997
<i>or inquired about his
background since Sandhurst...</i>

09:10.234 --> 09:12.429
<i>David took the
most curious tack...</i>

09:12.503 --> 09:15.438
<i>reacting as if I already knew
everything about him.</i>

09:31.255 --> 09:32.244
Yes?

09:32.689 --> 09:33.917
<i>Sigerson?</i>

09:33.991 --> 09:34.980
What's that?

09:35.058 --> 09:38.118
<i>Airport delivery. We found
this guy Sigerson's bags...</i>

09:38.195 --> 09:40.129
<i>and he called and he said
he wanted them delivered.</i>

09:40.197 --> 09:41.664
Here. Yes.

09:41.732 --> 09:44.826
Bloody aeroplane service. One
wonders how they stay in business.

09:45.702 --> 09:47.067
I'll let you in.

09:47.137 --> 09:48.126
Very sorry, old man.

09:48.205 --> 09:50.730
Clever of you to think up the
name of Worth for me in advance.

09:50.807 --> 09:52.172
I seriously considered using it.

09:52.242 --> 09:55.609
But stick to the tried
and true in this instance.

09:55.946 --> 09:58.574
So, Sigerson I shall be?

09:58.815 --> 10:00.976
Now, I'm having my bags
delivered to the guest house.

10:01.051 --> 10:02.211
If you don't mind...

10:02.286 --> 10:04.880
I'll nap before dinner.
Very tired after my journey.

10:06.089 --> 10:08.216
You'll have Alec's
papers by then?

10:09.293 --> 10:10.658
Yes...

10:11.061 --> 10:13.859
I was about go to his home
and collect them now.

10:14.031 --> 10:15.191
David-

10:15.265 --> 10:16.254
Sigerson.

10:16.600 --> 10:18.227
Stanley Sigerson.

10:21.438 --> 10:22.666
Until dinner.

10:58.208 --> 10:59.835
No, I'm sorry.
You can't.

11:00.143 --> 11:01.508
Mrs. Akawi.

11:01.979 --> 11:03.947
Here he is.
You can ask him for yourself.

11:05.382 --> 11:06.713
Mr. Higgins...

11:06.783 --> 11:10.014
these gentleman are trying to take
Sir Alec's things out of the house.

11:10.087 --> 11:11.645
I told them they couldn't.

11:12.322 --> 11:13.550
I'll see to it.

11:15.959 --> 11:17.620
What's the meaning of this?

11:17.694 --> 11:19.628
Sir Alec Ramsey
was probably one of England's...

11:19.696 --> 11:21.129
most famous explorers.

11:21.198 --> 11:23.189
Consequently, the British
Museum have laid claim...

11:23.266 --> 11:24.927
to all his personal effects.

11:25.002 --> 11:26.629
We are authorized
to pick them up.

11:26.970 --> 11:30.667
You do, I trust, have something
in writing to verify your claims?

11:30.741 --> 11:32.402
Certainly. Lever.

11:33.510 --> 11:36.775
Oh, I'm sorry. I seem to have
left the papers at the hotel.

11:36.847 --> 11:39.008
I specifically asked you...

11:39.983 --> 11:42.144
Well, apparently we've
come away without them.

11:42.219 --> 11:44.210
I'm so sorry
for the inconvenience.

11:44.287 --> 11:46.778
We will be back with the papers.

11:46.857 --> 11:48.256
I'm very sorry, sir.

11:48.325 --> 11:50.190
Don't worry.
We'll see ourselves out.

11:55.265 --> 11:58.234
Something about those two
I just don't trust.

11:58.802 --> 11:59.791
Quite.

12:00.804 --> 12:02.829
<i>It was morning
before the British Home Office...</i>

12:02.906 --> 12:05.238
<i>verified the identity
of their two agents.</i>

12:05.609 --> 12:08.271
<i>They also gave me
some rather shocking news.</i>

12:10.781 --> 12:12.476
<i>My old friend David...</i>

12:12.549 --> 12:15.484
<i>the man who now insisted on
using the name Sigerson...</i>

12:15.819 --> 12:18.720
<i>the most famous alias
of Sherlock Holmes...</i>

12:19.089 --> 12:21.819
<i>had received a medical
discharge from the army.</i>

12:22.292 --> 12:25.227
<i>Since that time, there was
absolutely no trace of him.</i>

12:25.395 --> 12:28.296
<i>And he was officially
presumed to be dead.</i>

12:44.981 --> 12:46.346
Come in.

12:47.784 --> 12:50.014
Good morning.
Good morning.

12:50.921 --> 12:53.947
Up and about already, I see.
And about time, too.

12:54.224 --> 12:58.126
I had thought you might be sleeping
in after 11 hours on a plane.

12:58.195 --> 12:59.685
Yes, quite right.

12:59.763 --> 13:02.732
I will admit to feeling
a little drugged yesterday.

13:03.133 --> 13:04.122
Really?

13:04.201 --> 13:06.135
But this morning,
it's quite different.

13:06.203 --> 13:07.932
I had a hearty breakfast,
a quick dip in the ocean...

13:08.004 --> 13:09.904
and I've been mulling
over in my mind...

13:09.973 --> 13:11.634
the task we have ahead of us.

13:11.708 --> 13:13.505
You're referring to this...

13:13.844 --> 13:15.641
theory about Alec's death?

13:15.712 --> 13:17.202
Hardly a theory.

13:18.248 --> 13:20.011
You do have his papers,
don't you?

13:20.517 --> 13:21.506
David...

13:22.853 --> 13:25.014
it's very difficult
losing a friend.

13:25.455 --> 13:30.119
And one can hardly be blamed for
finding catharsis in some escapism.

13:31.261 --> 13:34.321
I do not consider
solving a murder escapism.

13:34.965 --> 13:38.059
Alec had an absolute passion
for the works of Conan Doyle.

13:38.135 --> 13:41.969
I gather you're something of a
Baker Street Irregular yourself?

13:42.038 --> 13:43.027
A what?

13:44.541 --> 13:47.510
I do have excellent lodgings
in Baker Street, you know that.

13:47.577 --> 13:48.874
No, David, I don't know that.

13:48.945 --> 13:50.503
I don't know anything about you.

13:50.580 --> 13:53.048
Except that you insist on
calling yourself Sigerson-

13:53.116 --> 13:55.277
And you persist
in calling me David.

13:55.385 --> 13:56.977
There's no time
for this nonsense.

13:57.053 --> 13:59.920
Do we or do we not
have Alec's papers?

14:01.158 --> 14:02.147
No.

14:02.793 --> 14:06.627
The British Government has laid
claim to everything for museum use.

14:06.830 --> 14:09.128
That cunning rascal.

14:10.333 --> 14:12.062
So, they've made away
with everything?

14:12.135 --> 14:13.329
No.
They have nothing, yet.

14:13.403 --> 14:15.598
They're picking everything up
this afternoon.

14:17.340 --> 14:19.331
Then, there's no time to lose.

14:19.409 --> 14:20.398
David.

14:20.710 --> 14:23.941
I confirmed this matter with the
Home Office. Don't you understand?

14:24.014 --> 14:26.312
I understand perfectly. More's
the pity that you do not.

14:26.383 --> 14:29.784
Will you please stop talking in
bloody riddles and make sense?

14:30.520 --> 14:32.112
Moriarty, man!

14:32.189 --> 14:33.520
Can't you hear plainly enough?

14:33.590 --> 14:34.682
Moriarty!

14:35.659 --> 14:37.923
David, I understand
what you're going through.

14:37.994 --> 14:41.157
It's not unlike what they warned us
about our first year at Sandhurst...

14:41.231 --> 14:42.289
shellshock.

14:42.365 --> 14:45.095
We all assured each other,
it could never happen to us.

14:45.168 --> 14:46.396
Well, it can.

14:46.736 --> 14:48.704
If he gets the papers
and destroys them...

14:48.772 --> 14:51.900
before we get the clues
we need, he wins again.

14:57.981 --> 14:59.676
Well, don't just stand there.

14:59.749 --> 15:00.807
Let's go.

15:05.222 --> 15:06.985
Come, Watson, come.

15:08.892 --> 15:11.087
We may already be too late.

15:19.000 --> 15:22.401
<i>My Uncle George once
told me that a healthy curiosity...</i>

15:22.470 --> 15:24.768
<i>is the cornerstone
of scientific study...</i>

15:24.839 --> 15:26.898
<i>the building block to progress.</i>

15:26.975 --> 15:29.603
<i>My Aunt Odie later said
he always said that...</i>

15:29.677 --> 15:32.976
<i>just before he started snooping
into someone else's business.</i>

15:33.047 --> 15:35.038
<i>Now, I couldn't quite equate...</i>

15:35.116 --> 15:38.517
<i>spying on Higgins with
scientific study and progress.</i>

15:38.586 --> 15:39.678
<i>But then...</i>

15:39.754 --> 15:42.518
<i>I couldn't really see what
harm it would do either.</i>

15:50.865 --> 15:52.230
Steady, lads.

16:05.713 --> 16:06.873
<i>At Alec's place...</i>

16:06.948 --> 16:08.575
<i>David went off
in search of clues...</i>

16:08.649 --> 16:10.810
<i>to the whereabouts
of Moriarty...</i>

16:10.885 --> 16:13.115
<i>while I waited
for the museum chaps.</i>

16:13.187 --> 16:16.020
<i>Before they arrived, I
discovered Sir Alec's diary...</i>

16:16.424 --> 16:18.585
<i>and some rather
disturbing entries.</i>

16:21.162 --> 16:23.187
<i>Vague references to meetings...</i>

16:23.264 --> 16:25.425
<i>for the purpose of
discussing, as he put it...</i>

16:25.500 --> 16:27.127
<i>"the ongoing problem."</i>

16:27.535 --> 16:30.936
<i>Was it possible that David's
suspicions might have foundation?</i>

16:35.410 --> 16:38.573
<i>Whatever possessed me at that
moment to conceal the diary...</i>

16:38.646 --> 16:41.376
<i>I still to this day
do not understand.</i>

16:41.783 --> 16:45.116
<i>But I would later have reason
to be glad that I had.</i>

16:46.354 --> 16:47.446
Gentlemen.

16:56.431 --> 16:57.455
<i>As for David...</i>

16:57.532 --> 17:01.024
<i>I became more and more convinced that
his genuine schizoid conviction...</i>

17:01.102 --> 17:04.127
<i>that he was Mr. Holmes,
alias Mr. Sigerson...</i>

17:04.204 --> 17:08.436
<i>was surpassed only by his belief in
me as the faithful, obliging friend.</i>

17:08.509 --> 17:09.771
Watson.

17:09.944 --> 17:11.309
In here, quickly.

17:17.919 --> 17:20.512
Mrs. Akawi said
you wanted to see me.

17:20.855 --> 17:22.117
Take a look at this.

17:23.558 --> 17:25.924
Did Alec mention anything
to you about an accident?

17:25.992 --> 17:27.460
No, no, he didn't.

17:28.128 --> 17:30.097
It must have happened
rather recently.

17:30.164 --> 17:32.860
Rather. A week, at the most.

17:33.034 --> 17:34.763
More likely a few days.

17:34.836 --> 17:36.895
Oxidation works very quickly
in this climate...

17:36.971 --> 17:38.996
and there's no sign of rust.

17:39.073 --> 17:40.563
Very good, Watson.

17:40.675 --> 17:44.202
Alec's car was hit
by a 1974 Rolls-Royce...

17:44.545 --> 17:47.378
made before May 1.

17:47.548 --> 17:49.448
How on earth do you know that?

17:51.285 --> 17:52.411
Elementary.

17:55.123 --> 17:57.614
Now, you recognize this
poly-gloss black enamel paint...

17:57.692 --> 17:59.990
used exclusively
by Rolls-Royce?

18:00.761 --> 18:02.991
Now on the other side
of the paint chip...

18:03.064 --> 18:05.123
cadmium-yellow primer.

18:05.199 --> 18:07.997
Now, that was only made
in the first part of '74.

18:08.469 --> 18:09.458
So...

18:09.670 --> 18:12.366
all we have to do is
check out a few body shops...

18:12.440 --> 18:16.103
and see if any
1974 Rolls-Royces...

18:16.177 --> 18:18.077
went in for bodywork.

18:18.146 --> 18:19.204
I see.

18:19.280 --> 18:21.077
It's a far quicker route...

18:21.149 --> 18:22.844
to Moriarty than poison.

18:22.917 --> 18:23.906
Poison?

18:24.018 --> 18:25.679
When the attempt
on his life failed-

18:25.753 --> 18:26.742
Mr. Higgins...

18:26.821 --> 18:28.721
the men from the British
Museum are leaving.

18:28.789 --> 18:30.416
They have all
of Sir Alec's papers.

18:30.491 --> 18:32.015
Thank you,
Mrs. Akawi.

18:32.360 --> 18:33.918
You've got to stop them, Watson.

18:33.995 --> 18:35.656
We can't let them
get away with everything.

18:35.730 --> 18:36.958
They haven't.

18:37.965 --> 18:38.954
I...

18:39.834 --> 18:42.234
held back Sir Alec's diary.

18:42.336 --> 18:43.826
Sometimes, Watson...

18:44.338 --> 18:45.828
I underestimate you.

18:46.807 --> 18:50.174
No time to lose. Much work to
be done on this paint business.

19:57.011 --> 19:58.205
The wine cellar.

19:59.614 --> 20:01.377
I must check it later.

20:03.317 --> 20:05.114
Where was I, lads?

20:14.562 --> 20:15.927
<i>David...</i>

20:17.265 --> 20:20.894
<i>traced the car...</i>

20:21.469 --> 20:23.596
<i>in question...</i>

20:25.473 --> 20:26.462
<i>to...</i>

20:27.775 --> 20:30.073
<i>Weingarten's...</i>

20:31.012 --> 20:32.001
<i>Body...</i>

20:33.981 --> 20:34.970
<i>Shop.</i>

20:38.819 --> 20:39.945
I found it.

20:40.588 --> 20:44.547
Dirty, little, well-hidden place on,
what I think you call the North Shore.

20:44.625 --> 20:46.092
Believe me, Watson...

20:46.327 --> 20:48.386
the man who owns this
particular Rolls-Royce...

20:48.462 --> 20:50.623
didn't want that
repair work discovered.

20:50.698 --> 20:51.926
We have our man!

20:51.999 --> 20:54.194
How can you be sure
it's the right car?

20:54.669 --> 20:56.398
Simple deduction, really.

20:56.937 --> 20:58.370
One of three on the island...

20:58.439 --> 20:59.906
with the infamous
yellow primer...

20:59.974 --> 21:01.464
and the only one...

21:01.542 --> 21:04.010
that has recently been
involved in an accident.

21:06.213 --> 21:08.238
Registered
to a Chinese fellow...

21:08.716 --> 21:10.684
Ching Hoon Ching.

21:11.085 --> 21:12.746
Bring a hat, Watson.

21:12.820 --> 21:15.118
We're going to pay
our Mr. Ching a visit.

21:15.189 --> 21:17.089
No, wait, please.

21:17.658 --> 21:20.218
There is a gentleman
by that name who...

21:20.294 --> 21:22.592
well, if he had been responsible
for such an accident...

21:22.663 --> 21:24.893
he certainly wouldn't
be trying to hide it.

21:24.965 --> 21:26.830
Hoon Ching is one
of the most successful...

21:26.901 --> 21:28.801
and respected businessmen
on this island.

21:28.869 --> 21:31.099
So, what of it? He'll
have a chance to explain.

21:31.172 --> 21:33.970
No, I'm sorry. We can't just barge
in and accuse a man of his standing.

21:34.041 --> 21:36.339
Your attitude is becoming
very tedious, Watson.

21:36.410 --> 21:37.502
What's come over you?

21:37.578 --> 21:38.943
We have our culprit,
and you-

21:39.013 --> 21:41.846
I want to use some restraint,
please.

21:42.283 --> 21:43.773
Yes, well, hang your restraint!

21:44.418 --> 21:46.579
I'll attend
to Mr. Ching alone.

21:50.725 --> 21:52.317
<i>It wasn't just the fact...</i>

21:52.393 --> 21:54.691
<i>that David had indeed
located the body shop...</i>

21:54.962 --> 21:58.420
<i>or that he might embarrass one of
our city's leading citizens...</i>

21:58.499 --> 22:01.900
<i>that prompted me to accompany
him to Hoon Ching's residence.</i>

22:01.969 --> 22:04.460
<i>An entry in Alec's diary
led me to the conclusion...</i>

22:04.538 --> 22:08.497
<i>that Alec and David had been for some
time in correspondence over a case.</i>

22:08.876 --> 22:12.209
<i>A case involving someone
whose name started with "C."</i>

22:12.513 --> 22:13.502
<i>Ching?</i>

22:14.181 --> 22:16.911
<i>Perhaps, my own curiosity was
overcoming my better judgment.</i>

22:19.353 --> 22:20.547
Yeah?

22:20.621 --> 22:22.088
Mr. Hoon Ching, please.

22:22.823 --> 22:25.189
My father is busy.
You selling something?

22:25.259 --> 22:27.659
Perhaps we could make an
appointment for another time.

22:27.728 --> 22:29.753
We have urgent business.

22:30.030 --> 22:32.555
Please inform Mr. Ching
immediately.

22:32.833 --> 22:34.858
I told you, he's busy.

22:37.938 --> 22:40.099
We have irrefutable proof...

22:40.174 --> 22:44.042
that your father's car was involved
in a serious accident this past week.

22:44.111 --> 22:47.239
An accident which perhaps he
does not care to acknowledge.

22:47.581 --> 22:48.741
Victor.

22:48.816 --> 22:50.613
You told me you hit a tree.

22:54.789 --> 22:56.882
I told you
what you needed to hear.

22:56.957 --> 22:59.152
You damaged someone's
car and you don't even-

22:59.226 --> 23:02.161
Okay, so I hit the car.
Big deal.

23:07.368 --> 23:09.427
Apparently, my son was not...

23:09.503 --> 23:11.903
altogether truthful
about his accident.

23:12.640 --> 23:14.767
I apologize for any
inconvenience...

23:14.842 --> 23:17.276
and I shall call my insurance
company immediately.

23:17.344 --> 23:19.437
Oh, yes, thank you.
I'll leave my card.

23:19.513 --> 23:20.502
No.
But...

23:22.183 --> 23:24.845
Perhaps, it's best
to make contact with...

23:24.919 --> 23:27.012
Mr. Ching at a later time.

23:27.321 --> 23:29.653
When all the
arrangements are made...

23:29.990 --> 23:32.220
can we plan to meet again,
Mr. Ching?

23:32.626 --> 23:33.786
As you wish.

23:34.261 --> 23:36.525
But I will need
the name of the car's owner.

23:36.597 --> 23:39.259
The late Sir Alec Ramsey.

23:39.633 --> 23:40.895
Good day, sir.

23:53.080 --> 23:55.344
Did you see through
his disguise, Watson?

23:55.583 --> 23:56.572
It's he.

23:57.117 --> 23:58.880
We've stood
face-to-face again.

23:58.953 --> 24:00.318
You think it's...

24:00.387 --> 24:01.376
Moriarty.

24:04.892 --> 24:06.883
<i>David was building his plot.</i>

24:06.961 --> 24:09.486
<i>First, there was the crime
for Holmes to solve.</i>

24:09.563 --> 24:12.623
<i>Then came Watson,
and now Moriarty.</i>

24:12.700 --> 24:15.396
<i>And the vow to stop
the master criminal.</i>

24:20.174 --> 24:23.541
<i>As I examined Alec's diary into
the early hours of the morning...</i>

24:23.777 --> 24:25.574
<i>I began to have
the uneasy feeling...</i>

24:25.646 --> 24:28.479
<i>that David was not as mad
as I had first presumed.</i>

24:29.149 --> 24:31.811
<i>The wording of certain
entries left no doubt...</i>

24:31.886 --> 24:34.184
<i>that Alec was involved
with something illegal...</i>

24:34.255 --> 24:36.985
<i>perhaps a crime as heinous
as drug trafficking.</i>

24:52.406 --> 24:54.874
<i>And I had to conclude that
David's deductions might...</i>

24:54.942 --> 24:58.173
<i>very well be leading him to the
perpetrators of that crime.</i>

25:02.883 --> 25:03.872
David.

25:08.656 --> 25:09.645
David.

25:23.837 --> 25:24.826
David.

25:25.873 --> 25:27.363
Are you all right?

25:37.983 --> 25:41.680
<i>When I was a kid, we
had a cocker spaniel named Topper.</i>

25:42.120 --> 25:44.315
<i>Stubbornest dog I ever knew.</i>

25:44.857 --> 25:46.848
<i>He took it in his head
one day that he wanted...</i>

25:46.925 --> 25:49.052
<i>one of my tennis shoes
for a chew toy.</i>

25:49.127 --> 25:51.527
<i>And no matter where
I hid that tennis shoe...</i>

25:51.630 --> 25:52.858
<i>he'd find it.</i>

25:53.499 --> 25:55.023
<i>Years later, my mom said...</i>

25:55.100 --> 25:57.432
<i>I had become every bit
as stubborn as my dog.</i>

25:57.636 --> 25:59.968
<i>Frankly, I never thought
of myself as stubborn.</i>

26:00.806 --> 26:02.103
<i>Just patient.</i>

26:12.551 --> 26:13.540
Higgins.

26:14.152 --> 26:16.245
I've been trying
to talk to you all day.

26:16.321 --> 26:17.413
I know.

26:17.489 --> 26:19.286
I've got sort of a problem,
Higgins.

26:19.358 --> 26:21.189
I wouldn't bother you unless
it was really important...

26:21.260 --> 26:22.852
but there's this lens
that you keep-

26:22.928 --> 26:23.917
Higgins!

26:34.940 --> 26:37.135
<i>For some hours
after David's disappearance...</i>

26:37.209 --> 26:40.007
<i>I combed the grounds
for signs of forced entry.</i>

26:40.479 --> 26:42.071
<i>The estate was secure.</i>

26:42.381 --> 26:45.282
<i>David's abduction was
assuredly the work of experts.</i>

26:47.886 --> 26:50.878
<i>Just as I resigned myself
to phoning the authorities...</i>

26:50.956 --> 26:53.754
<i>I received a call that
gave me cause for hope.</i>

26:54.059 --> 26:55.356
<i>A male voice...</i>

26:55.427 --> 26:57.918
<i>with an accent I could only
guess to be Oriental...</i>

26:57.996 --> 26:59.896
<i>had instructed me
to come to a spot...</i>

26:59.965 --> 27:02.525
<i>in the tawdriest part
of town and wait.</i>

27:08.674 --> 27:10.574
<i>David was right once again.</i>

27:11.009 --> 27:13.068
<i>I had been a bumbling Watson...</i>

27:13.145 --> 27:16.080
<i>obsessed with the now trivial
matter of Alec's past...</i>

27:16.448 --> 27:18.939
<i>not there to assist
when his own deductions...</i>

27:19.017 --> 27:21.008
<i>had led him into grave danger.</i>

27:29.394 --> 27:31.157
<i>I hadn't realized
until that moment...</i>

27:31.229 --> 27:33.561
<i>how strong the bonds
of friendship really are.</i>

27:34.166 --> 27:37.658
<i>I was deeply concerned for the
safety of my old school chum.</i>

27:43.642 --> 27:45.576
Get out of here.
What do you want?

27:45.844 --> 27:48.039
Your name is Watson.

27:48.246 --> 27:49.941
Certainly, not.

27:53.085 --> 27:55.451
My name is Chee.

27:56.088 --> 27:58.716
Are you the man who called me
about my friend? Where is he?

27:58.790 --> 28:00.121
Is he all right?

28:00.292 --> 28:02.658
I was told to look
for a bowler hat.

28:03.662 --> 28:04.924
See here.

28:08.367 --> 28:11.063
I think, you've given up wearing
it altogether, my good man.

28:11.136 --> 28:12.831
Too warm for this climate, eh?

28:12.904 --> 28:13.996
David.

28:15.207 --> 28:17.402
Sigerson. Follow me.

28:20.979 --> 28:22.844
What on earth happened to you?

28:22.914 --> 28:25.246
Judging from the small
punctures in my side...

28:25.317 --> 28:26.875
some form of drugged dart.

28:26.952 --> 28:28.351
I eluded my captors...

28:28.420 --> 28:31.856
and in short order, I found
some materials for this disguise.

28:32.691 --> 28:35.159
An excellent mask,
if I say it myself, eh?

28:36.261 --> 28:39.662
A Chinese ancient can learn more
in a few minutes on these streets...

28:39.731 --> 28:41.665
than an Englishman
can ever discover.

28:41.733 --> 28:42.995
David...

28:43.068 --> 28:45.662
I demand some
kind of explanation.

28:45.737 --> 28:46.931
No time to explain!

28:49.741 --> 28:51.436
Act like you know
why you're here...

28:51.510 --> 28:53.603
and leave me
to handle everything.

29:09.461 --> 29:10.450
Please.

29:31.583 --> 29:32.743
$50.

29:33.118 --> 29:35.177
My friend will gladly pay.

29:35.320 --> 29:36.981
$50 for these?

29:37.055 --> 29:39.523
My friend will pay.
It is indeed a bargain.

29:42.060 --> 29:44.051
Yes, yes, of course.

29:44.529 --> 29:46.656
They're easily
worth twice as much.

30:10.555 --> 30:13.046
Harmless,
smoke-producing powder.

30:13.859 --> 30:14.848
Huh?

30:16.261 --> 30:19.924
Moriarty's men must believe
that we're partaking of opium.

30:20.332 --> 30:21.526
Moriarty.

30:22.400 --> 30:24.527
Still one and the same with...

30:25.003 --> 30:29.030
The amiable and well-beloved
businessman, Hoon Ching.

30:31.076 --> 30:33.237
This island's underworld prince.

30:33.378 --> 30:36.006
Brothels, illegal casinos...

30:36.081 --> 30:39.050
drug trafficking, opium
palaces just like this one.

30:39.885 --> 30:42.046
Ching is his best
disguise so far.

30:46.992 --> 30:48.983
Pretend you're enjoying it,
Watson.

30:56.434 --> 30:59.460
I had no idea places
like this still existed.

31:00.772 --> 31:02.706
There are lot of things
you're not aware of yet.

31:02.808 --> 31:03.934
I believe I am.

31:05.076 --> 31:07.169
I know you and Alec
were corresponding.

31:08.513 --> 31:10.105
It's all in the diary.

31:10.882 --> 31:13.350
I can understand your trying
to conceal from me...

31:13.418 --> 31:15.318
the possibility that Alec was...

31:15.387 --> 31:18.356
somehow involved
in the sale of opium.

31:19.124 --> 31:20.819
He wasn't selling.

31:20.926 --> 31:22.553
The diary lists everything.

31:22.627 --> 31:25.152
Meeting places,
dates, shipping lines.

31:25.230 --> 31:27.562
Even the name
of a supplier in Burma.

31:27.866 --> 31:29.458
What else could it be?

31:29.701 --> 31:32.932
You know, I sometimes truly
underestimate you, Watson.

31:36.942 --> 31:38.432
But you're wrong about Alec.

31:39.911 --> 31:42.345
I'm surprised that Moriarty
hasn't made his move.

31:42.414 --> 31:43.540
His move?

31:43.882 --> 31:46.442
They'll be no attempt
to harm us here, naturally.

31:46.518 --> 31:47.644
Too public.

31:48.920 --> 31:50.012
Naturally.

31:51.089 --> 31:53.523
We'll be taken elsewhere.
Moriarty will be there.

31:54.192 --> 31:57.184
He wouldn't miss witnessing
our death for the world.

31:57.362 --> 32:00.126
Perhaps we should alert someone.

32:00.665 --> 32:01.893
I'm prepared.

32:07.505 --> 32:08.938
His own medicine.

32:09.407 --> 32:12.069
The same deadly herbal
poison that killed Alec.

32:13.011 --> 32:15.605
I cannot be a party to this.

32:15.914 --> 32:17.472
I'll catch him off his guard.

32:17.549 --> 32:20.143
David, this has got to stop.

32:20.819 --> 32:23.379
Trust me one step further,
Watson.

32:23.455 --> 32:25.616
Excuse me.

32:25.824 --> 32:27.815
I overcharged you for the pipes.

32:28.193 --> 32:29.660
I make it up to you.

32:29.861 --> 32:33.661
Take you to a place of great
pleasure, where your virility...

32:33.732 --> 32:35.359
will much improve.

32:39.204 --> 32:42.537
This seems to be a harmless
enough treatment.

32:43.408 --> 32:46.639
I hardly think these
needles are going to kill us.

32:46.711 --> 32:48.372
No, of course not.

32:48.446 --> 32:52.780
But Moriarty has no idea we are
knowledgeable in the art of acupuncture.

32:53.952 --> 32:56.420
You know how to turn
without causing pain?

32:57.022 --> 32:58.580
Yes, of course.

32:59.224 --> 33:00.885
While in Malaysia, I-

33:00.959 --> 33:02.017
Good.

33:02.093 --> 33:05.221
He believes us to be
drugged and in fear of moving.

33:05.864 --> 33:08.958
Our cunning foe has
left nothing to chance.

33:09.167 --> 33:11.601
And neither have we, I trust?

33:11.703 --> 33:13.637
No. When he returns,
the doctor will be carrying...

33:13.705 --> 33:15.832
a syringe like I have.

33:16.041 --> 33:18.509
When he goes
to inject the poison...

33:19.010 --> 33:21.240
leap from the table
and overpower him.

33:21.913 --> 33:23.881
I will deal with Moriarty.

33:24.816 --> 33:25.805
Leap?

33:25.884 --> 33:28.045
We must pretend
to be fast asleep...

33:28.119 --> 33:30.053
until they are right beside us.

33:30.121 --> 33:31.645
If we get separated,
stall them...

33:31.723 --> 33:33.054
until I get back...

33:33.124 --> 33:34.853
with the evidence that I need.

33:35.994 --> 33:37.256
On your guard.

33:51.743 --> 33:53.233
Watson, run for it.

33:53.311 --> 33:54.300
The back.

33:54.746 --> 33:55.735
No, wait.

33:57.782 --> 33:59.181
Don't let him get away!

34:04.422 --> 34:05.411
Mr. Higgins...

34:05.490 --> 34:06.752
The explanation.

34:06.825 --> 34:07.814
Listen...

34:07.892 --> 34:09.154
Let's have it.

34:10.128 --> 34:11.789
Why were you
speaking in Russian?

34:12.797 --> 34:14.697
That's nothing
but an anesthesia gun.

34:14.766 --> 34:16.255
Yes, I'm aware of that.

34:16.333 --> 34:20.270
I don't think you really want to
be asleep for the next five hours.

34:21.106 --> 34:22.094
Four.

34:24.342 --> 34:26.639
Despite the Home Office
verification...

34:26.710 --> 34:28.542
you're not from
the British Museum.

34:28.612 --> 34:29.601
No.

34:29.981 --> 34:32.882
Mr. Higgins, we needed Sir Alec's
papers to check for any comments...

34:32.951 --> 34:36.387
that might prove to be embarrassing
to Her Majesty's government.

34:36.454 --> 34:38.614
And dangerous to Mr. Worth.

34:39.556 --> 34:40.649
Dangerous?

34:41.525 --> 34:43.255
David Malcolm Worth...

34:43.728 --> 34:45.753
alias Stanley Sigerson...

34:46.130 --> 34:48.725
is an escapee
from a home for the insane.

34:51.770 --> 34:53.704
And why, may I ask...

34:53.772 --> 34:55.706
would MI6 be so interested...

34:55.774 --> 34:59.141
in the whereabouts of one
mentally troubled person?

34:59.644 --> 35:02.306
When that person happens to have
been a British secret agent...

35:02.380 --> 35:04.405
in Russia for 30 years.

35:04.516 --> 35:08.748
Mr. Higgins, he has enough information
in that scrambled brain of his...

35:08.820 --> 35:10.344
to start a war.

35:15.387 --> 35:17.249
<i>Under normal circumstances...</i>

35:17.327 --> 35:20.296
<i>I guess you'd have to say
I'm a pretty easygoing guy.</i>

35:20.363 --> 35:22.923
<i>Under normal circumstances.
But Higgins...</i>

35:22.999 --> 35:24.261
<i>had gone too far.</i>

35:24.334 --> 35:26.894
<i>It was no longer even a matter
of getting the camera lens.</i>

35:26.970 --> 35:30.133
<i>It was more important to prove
to myself and to him, I guess...</i>

35:30.206 --> 35:32.333
<i>that I could get into that room.</i>

35:32.775 --> 35:34.106
<i>And I figured...</i>

35:34.177 --> 35:36.509
<i>if the lads wanted out
badly enough...</i>

35:36.579 --> 35:38.843
<i>Higgins would have
to take them out.</i>

35:46.222 --> 35:48.690
Zeus, Apollo. Stay.

35:54.631 --> 35:55.825
Very well.

35:58.101 --> 35:59.398
Perhaps you're right.

35:59.469 --> 36:01.960
We could all use a walk
about the grounds.

36:14.884 --> 36:16.249
All right, lads.

36:16.753 --> 36:18.653
Here we go.

36:38.808 --> 36:42.073
"I gave Hopkins
the secret code..."

36:42.145 --> 36:44.272
"to the opium den..."

36:44.347 --> 36:47.180
"on the off-chance David
had slipped back inside."

36:47.250 --> 36:48.274
This is great.

36:48.351 --> 36:49.477
Mr. Higgins.

36:49.786 --> 36:51.185
He's not in there.

36:51.654 --> 36:53.349
Perhaps Lever's come across him.

36:53.423 --> 36:56.517
I hoped he might have gone
back to the car, but...

36:56.592 --> 36:57.957
Not our Mr. Worth.

36:58.027 --> 36:59.927
He's probably already
found a new disguise.

36:59.996 --> 37:02.829
And may be hot on the trail of
yet another infamous Dr. Moriarty.

37:04.500 --> 37:06.968
Rather embarrassing to have
lost him twice in the one day.

37:08.538 --> 37:10.938
Then you abducted
him from the estate.

37:11.140 --> 37:12.129
Yes.

37:12.909 --> 37:14.536
He's our greatest challenge.

37:15.578 --> 37:19.105
We censor all his mail, all records
of his identity have been destroyed.

37:19.182 --> 37:20.740
He's watched round the clock.

37:20.817 --> 37:23.012
Yet this is his fifth escape
from the sanatorium.

37:23.086 --> 37:25.611
This time due to my telegram.

37:26.155 --> 37:28.385
I thought you said
his mail was censored?

37:28.458 --> 37:30.255
Yes, well, it seemed
harmless enough...

37:30.326 --> 37:32.521
the notice of the
death of an old friend.

37:32.595 --> 37:35.530
Whose letters you also
considered harmless.

37:36.366 --> 37:37.355
Quite.

37:40.670 --> 37:42.399
What happened
to the Chinese doctor...

37:42.472 --> 37:44.599
we accidentally tranquilized?

37:44.941 --> 37:46.408
I don't know.
Hopkins.

37:46.476 --> 37:48.000
Have you found him?

37:48.077 --> 37:50.102
A patrolman on the next block,
roughly 30 minutes ago...

37:50.179 --> 37:52.579
says he saw an elderly Chinese
gentleman running along...

37:52.648 --> 37:54.479
picking needles out of his face.

37:54.550 --> 37:56.313
The patrolman tried
to stop him but was-

37:56.386 --> 37:57.751
Eluded.
Right.

37:58.321 --> 38:00.983
Well, we've got nothing better
to do. Let's go look for him.

38:01.491 --> 38:03.186
I'm staying with the car.

38:03.259 --> 38:05.386
I'd go home, Mr. Higgins.

38:06.696 --> 38:07.958
That would be best.

38:14.303 --> 38:16.294
Psst. Psst.

38:23.980 --> 38:25.675
David, is that you?

38:54.477 --> 38:56.638
You crazy old coots
are pretty swift...

38:56.979 --> 38:58.844
getting away from my doctor.

38:59.515 --> 39:02.040
Now suppose you tell me
where the doctor is.

39:02.118 --> 39:04.211
And where we can
find your friend?

39:04.887 --> 39:08.254
I'm afraid you're wasting
your time questioning me.

39:09.192 --> 39:10.181
Am I?

39:15.098 --> 39:17.362
I need to know
where the doctor is...

39:17.800 --> 39:19.893
and I need to know
where your friend is.

39:20.436 --> 39:23.269
<i>As they moved the
flame closer to my hand...</i>

39:23.739 --> 39:25.502
<i>I began to recognize
a feeling...</i>

39:25.575 --> 39:28.305
<i>I hadn't had since
my combat days.</i>

39:28.544 --> 39:31.980
<i>A numbing, sickly sweet
feeling slipped through me.</i>

39:32.381 --> 39:34.440
"I knew I had no
information to give them..."

39:34.517 --> 39:36.451
"but, if I could stall them..."

39:36.586 --> 39:39.521
"I could buy my old friend
some valuable time."

39:41.557 --> 39:43.047
Oh, my God.

39:43.793 --> 39:46.626
Higgins.
Now, Higgins, I can explain.

39:47.096 --> 39:48.723
Or should I say Watson?

39:50.800 --> 39:51.858
Get out.

39:52.268 --> 39:55.396
No, I mean, where do you
get this stuff? This is great!

39:55.471 --> 39:57.371
I mean, guys running around
in kimonos...

39:57.440 --> 39:59.135
pulling needles
out of their faces.

39:59.208 --> 40:01.335
I mean, you've really
topped yourself, Higgins.

40:04.514 --> 40:05.811
You look awful.

40:09.752 --> 40:11.151
Look...

40:11.220 --> 40:13.654
I mean,
I just came in to get this...

40:13.723 --> 40:15.816
this camera lens that I needed.

40:15.892 --> 40:17.587
I tried to ask you for it,
but...

40:17.660 --> 40:19.127
you were acting so mysterious.

40:19.195 --> 40:22.062
I guess I just had to find
out what you were up to.

40:22.632 --> 40:24.623
So you invaded my privacy.

40:25.234 --> 40:28.465
Read personal papers that were
not intended for your eyes.

40:28.571 --> 40:30.630
And then, when caught...

40:30.706 --> 40:33.231
made a joke out
of the entire affair.

40:34.610 --> 40:36.635
I'm sorry, Higgins.

40:38.047 --> 40:39.844
I just got carried away.

40:40.116 --> 40:42.482
And you're right. I just
thought it was a game.

40:42.618 --> 40:43.710
I'm sorry.

40:44.420 --> 40:45.785
So what happened?

40:47.957 --> 40:50.425
I mean, I figure
one of two things. Either...

40:50.526 --> 40:51.823
you got out of it by yourself...

40:51.894 --> 40:54.692
or these fake museum guys
came back and rescued you.

40:55.531 --> 40:58.591
You actually believe I'm
going to discuss this with you?

40:58.935 --> 41:00.835
Well, I've had some experience.

41:01.237 --> 41:02.761
Experience.

41:04.574 --> 41:06.565
This has nothing to do with you.

41:08.077 --> 41:10.511
It happened long before
you were here.

41:11.280 --> 41:12.440
Well, I know that...

41:12.815 --> 41:14.146
now.

41:15.117 --> 41:16.482
I just thought...

41:17.186 --> 41:20.019
that two friends discussing
an interesting case...

41:20.356 --> 41:21.823
I was just curious.

41:23.960 --> 41:25.484
And absolutely right.

41:26.829 --> 41:29.992
When you said experience, I thought
you were referring to this case.

41:31.133 --> 41:32.896
Friendship, of course...

41:33.002 --> 41:34.663
is quite another matter.

41:35.137 --> 41:39.073
A matter I find it particularly
difficult to discuss at the moment.

41:42.612 --> 41:43.704
Well.

41:45.548 --> 41:48.278
The large Oriental gentleman...

41:48.951 --> 41:50.885
seemed to take great delight...

41:50.953 --> 41:53.547
in moving my hand
closer to the flame.

41:55.424 --> 41:59.588
One never likes
to admit to fear, of course.

42:00.363 --> 42:01.352
<i>But...</i>

42:01.430 --> 42:03.557
<i>I had no doubt
they meant to torture me...</i>

42:03.633 --> 42:05.601
<i>even kill me if need be.</i>

42:06.068 --> 42:08.400
<i>How much could I
endure without talking?</i>

42:08.771 --> 42:12.298
<i>It was a question each of us had
asked ourselves at Sandhurst...</i>

42:12.575 --> 42:14.736
<i>and throughout
our military careers.</i>

42:15.745 --> 42:17.736
Where have you
stashed the doctor?

42:20.049 --> 42:21.482
So David was right.

42:22.485 --> 42:23.918
You did kill Alec.

42:24.320 --> 42:27.448
And anyone else who comes
snooping into my business.

42:28.224 --> 42:30.158
Very careless, Victor.

42:30.693 --> 42:32.820
For one who presumes
to take my place.

42:32.895 --> 42:34.829
All very careless.

42:35.431 --> 42:37.058
You can kill this man.

42:37.400 --> 42:39.732
But if you don't
find his friend...

42:39.802 --> 42:43.363
he obviously knows a great deal
about your business interests.

42:43.706 --> 42:46.334
Release him now and I'll
still try to help you.

42:47.176 --> 42:48.302
Release him!

42:57.353 --> 42:59.617
You don't seem to
understand, do you?

43:00.523 --> 43:02.081
You're no longer in charge.

43:18.741 --> 43:20.003
Where have you been?

43:23.079 --> 43:24.603
Your time just ran out.

43:29.318 --> 43:31.582
The Doc here
is a master at this stuff.

43:31.821 --> 43:33.220
It doesn't hurt.

43:33.823 --> 43:35.347
Just stops the heart.

43:43.866 --> 43:45.959
Turn Watson loose. Now.

43:48.003 --> 43:49.265
Let him go.

43:51.707 --> 43:53.800
My apologies
for the tardiness...

43:53.876 --> 43:55.901
and slight miscalculation,
Watson...

43:55.978 --> 43:57.536
but the plan remains intact.

43:57.713 --> 43:58.702
So...

43:58.914 --> 44:00.108
Moriarty...

44:00.583 --> 44:03.313
you were the son and
not the father all along.

44:04.153 --> 44:05.313
Mr. Ching...

44:05.788 --> 44:08.222
you're a master criminal
in your own right.

44:08.290 --> 44:10.190
But, not the one
at the moment, eh?

44:10.359 --> 44:12.293
Herbal poison, Watson.

44:12.361 --> 44:15.421
Close to the lethal
concoction used on Alec.

44:15.498 --> 44:18.160
But why on earth
would they kill him?

44:18.234 --> 44:19.223
Unless...

44:20.169 --> 44:21.830
he was onto their scheme.

44:21.904 --> 44:22.996
Precisely.

44:23.139 --> 44:26.040
And now the entries in the
diary begin to make sense.

44:26.108 --> 44:29.100
He must have been collecting
evidence against Victor.

44:29.178 --> 44:31.408
Trying to become
a master detective...

44:33.082 --> 44:34.071
like you.

44:35.251 --> 44:37.549
Unfortunately,
he was not a master.

44:37.620 --> 44:40.418
Just a good Baker Street
Irregular game player...

44:41.023 --> 44:42.957
and Victor discovered the plot.

44:43.259 --> 44:45.318
Really, Watson,
you excel yourself.

44:45.394 --> 44:47.225
Quite elementary, actually.

44:47.296 --> 44:48.661
But thank you...

44:49.498 --> 44:50.658
Holmes.

44:51.534 --> 44:52.762
Now, Watson...

44:52.902 --> 44:55.200
if you will be good enough
to open the door...

44:55.271 --> 44:58.536
I'll take our Moriarty
to the authorities.

45:03.479 --> 45:04.707
Gentlemen.

45:09.685 --> 45:11.175
Put down the syringe.

45:12.922 --> 45:14.822
We'll call the police
to come for this crew.

45:14.890 --> 45:16.187
David...

45:16.459 --> 45:18.586
you've solved
the crime, all right?

45:20.196 --> 45:21.527
We'll take it from here.

45:23.999 --> 45:25.364
Moriarty.

45:25.734 --> 45:27.929
You are a most admirable foe.

45:28.471 --> 45:29.460
Watson.

45:29.738 --> 45:31.000
Take my lead.

45:40.216 --> 45:41.945
Watson.

45:43.452 --> 45:45.249
What's the meaning of this?

45:48.057 --> 45:49.046
Why?

45:56.665 --> 45:58.599
David was returned to England...

45:59.034 --> 46:01.093
and the safety
of the sanatorium.

46:04.640 --> 46:08.269
He very kindly forgave me and
we corresponded regularly...

46:08.544 --> 46:12.537
happily creating and solving
the most complex crimes.

46:13.949 --> 46:17.612
Then several months ago, I received
the most curious letter from him.

46:17.686 --> 46:19.517
In part, it read...

46:19.588 --> 46:21.488
"It's done, Watson."

46:21.824 --> 46:25.590
"I am now convinced my
wits have dulled with age."

46:25.928 --> 46:28.863
"I grant to Moriarty
his victory."

46:29.331 --> 46:32.630
"But the good fight
was waged, eh?"

46:35.104 --> 46:38.369
It was signed, most
uncharacteristically...

46:38.574 --> 46:40.041
David Worth...

46:40.643 --> 46:42.804
Wellwood Sanatorium, Surrey.

46:47.750 --> 46:50.116
That's the last time
you heard from him?

46:52.721 --> 46:55.087
Forgive me for being such
a boor the last few days.

46:55.157 --> 46:57.421
My obsession, as you call it.

46:57.660 --> 46:59.651
It did, however, seem...

46:59.895 --> 47:02.329
terribly important
that it be done now.

47:07.169 --> 47:08.329
He died?

47:09.738 --> 47:11.137
Last week.

47:12.741 --> 47:15.767
Terribly sad for a man
who so loved excitement.

47:17.212 --> 47:18.873
Simple pneumonia.

47:44.840 --> 47:45.966
Watson.
