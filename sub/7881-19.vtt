Today?
Try Berlin in '38.

So many different people.

00:44.083 --> 00:45.291
So many opinions.

00:45.333 --> 00:48.333
A marketplace of ideas.

00:48.375 --> 00:50.375
Anyway,
today in sex-ed,

00:50.417 --> 00:53.083
we're asking our teacher
anonymous questions.

00:53.125 --> 00:54.709
It can be anything
we want to know.

00:54.750 --> 00:55.917
That's great, honey.

00:55.959 --> 00:57.375
You know, Steve,
legend has it,

00:57.417 --> 00:59.291
that if you can stump
a sex-ed teacher,

00:59.333 --> 01:01.417
you become the
sex-ed teacher.

01:01.458 --> 01:03.625
"There can be only one!"

01:03.667 --> 01:06.500
Hey. Did you guys know
that there's a landmass

01:06.542 --> 01:08.959
made up of garbage that's
floating in the Pacific Ocean?

01:09.000 --> 01:10.959
You shouldn't
have to go that far

01:11.000 --> 01:12.959
just to throw away
that manly jacket.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.792
Well, I'm tired of ignoring
the world's problems.

01:15.834 --> 01:19.208
So, today, I start my new job
for a local news reporter

01:19.250 --> 01:20.458

01:20.500 --> 01:22.208
Oh, that sounds hard.

01:22.250 --> 01:23.583
Are you sure
you want to bother?

01:23.625 --> 01:26.417
Look, this is my chance
to get the truth out there

01:26.458 --> 01:28.709
about Garbage Island
and so many other things.

01:28.750 --> 01:32.500
People need to know the dangers
of eating non-organic fruit

01:32.542 --> 01:33.834
and that vaccines are--

01:33.875 --> 01:35.000

01:37.250 --> 01:39.583
Damn it!
One at a time, you guys.

01:39.625 --> 01:41.875
This is why we had
all those drills.

01:41.917 --> 01:43.083

Is heroin the
new cure for cancer?

02:42.375 --> 02:44.959
What I don't know about things
will shock you.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.375
And cut. We're clear.

02:47.417 --> 02:48.458
You're late.

02:48.500 --> 02:50.041
You're
Genevieve Vavance?

02:50.083 --> 02:52.250
I thought I was working for
a real reporter.

02:52.291 --> 02:53.750
I am a real reporter.

02:53.792 --> 02:57.208
I broadcast live to Langley
Falls every night on channel 438

02:57.250 --> 02:59.542
after reruns of the
Taiwanese prayer breakfast.

02:59.583 --> 03:01.834
First pitch meeting
is this afternoon.

03:01.875 --> 03:03.583
Prepare to wow me.

03:03.625 --> 03:04.917
You're already
halfway there.

03:04.959 --> 03:05.917
I love that jacket.

03:05.959 --> 03:07.000
Is it...?

03:07.041 --> 03:08.667
Yeah. Cheap.

03:12.875 --> 03:14.792
All right.
It's time for me to answer

03:14.834 --> 03:17.166
your anonymous questions
about sex.

03:17.208 --> 03:19.542
"I've had sex three times."

03:19.583 --> 03:20.667
Kudos.

03:20.709 --> 03:22.834
But that's not a question.

03:22.875 --> 03:26.000
"What's it called when you
kiss someone on the toilet?"

03:26.041 --> 03:27.375
Good question.

03:27.417 --> 03:31.083
Scientists call that
a "San Diego Thank You."

03:32.834 --> 03:37.125
"Is it true that, during sex,
a woman's uterus can create

03:37.166 --> 03:41.000
a vacuum-like effect and suck
a person up inside of it?"

03:42.542 --> 03:43.625
Idiot.

03:43.667 --> 03:44.917
Hold up. Hold up.

03:44.959 --> 03:47.041
I recognize this handwriting.

03:47.083 --> 03:48.667
It's Steve Smith's.

03:48.709 --> 03:50.083
Loser!

03:50.125 --> 03:53.542
Hey, Steve! Look out...!

04:01.542 --> 04:03.083
Okay. Story ideas.

04:03.125 --> 04:04.792
Now, I don't know
where you worked before,

04:04.834 --> 04:07.709
but Genevieve Vavance does
things a little differently.

04:09.083 --> 04:10.458
Now, pitch.

04:11.834 --> 04:13.959
How 'bout we do a report
on the corruption

04:13.959 --> 04:15.000
in the Langley Light Rail?

04:15.041 --> 04:15.875
No.

04:17.417 --> 04:18.792
Can we please get

04:18.834 --> 04:21.625
a bullet intern to make sure
I always have bullets?

04:21.667 --> 04:23.625
We had one.
We had one?

04:23.667 --> 04:24.500
What happened to her?

04:24.542 --> 04:26.166
Oh, that's right.

04:26.917 --> 04:28.250
She went back to school.

04:28.291 --> 04:29.333
She was great.

04:29.375 --> 04:30.667
She's gonna do great things.

04:30.709 --> 04:34.000
Well, I want to do an exposé
about Garbage Island.

04:34.041 --> 04:36.875
It's a giant mass of trash
polluting the Pacific Ocean.

04:36.917 --> 04:38.625
You know what's garbage?
That story.

04:38.667 --> 04:41.166
Come on, I need something juicy
to boost my ratings!

04:41.208 --> 04:43.000
I need a serial killer priest!

04:43.041 --> 04:44.375
I need a vegetarian cop!

04:44.417 --> 04:46.792
I need a senator cheating
on his wife with a bagel!

04:49.375 --> 04:50.500
All of you,
get out there

04:50.542 --> 04:53.625
and find me
my JonBenét Ramsey!

04:53.667 --> 04:56.875
But Garbage Island is a story
that people need to hear.

04:56.875 --> 04:57.875
I'll tell you what

04:57.917 --> 05:00.166
you find me a story
that gets me ratings

05:00.208 --> 05:03.041
and I'll let you report
on as much idealistic
crap as you want.

05:03.083 --> 05:05.291
Genevieve?
My bagel and I are ready

05:05.333 --> 05:07.291
to tell our side
of the story.

05:07.333 --> 05:09.041
You have my ear, Senator.

05:13.041 --> 05:14.542
Today was awful.

05:14.583 --> 05:15.750
Someone spray painted

05:15.792 --> 05:17.250
"Steve Smith thinks
vaginas suck"

05:17.291 --> 05:18.250
on my locker.

05:18.291 --> 05:19.875
So what?
People think you're gay.

05:19.917 --> 05:21.208
I wish!

05:21.250 --> 05:22.500
No one thinks I'm sexual at all,

05:22.542 --> 05:24.834
because of the stupid question
I asked in class.

05:24.875 --> 05:26.750
My day was worse.

05:26.792 --> 05:28.458
My new boss is Roger.

05:28.500 --> 05:30.667
I-I wanted to make
a difference in the world,

05:30.709 --> 05:32.917
but he just wants
a missing kid
to sensationalize.

05:32.959 --> 05:34.792
Missing kids are so lucky.

05:34.834 --> 05:36.667
I'd kill to
disappear right now.

05:36.709 --> 05:38.500
Wait a minute...

05:38.542 --> 05:39.750
What if you did disappear?

05:39.792 --> 05:40.792
What do you mean?

05:40.834 --> 05:41.917
Yeah. Yeah.

05:41.959 --> 05:43.500
We pretend
you were kidnapped

05:43.542 --> 05:45.166
and we hide you away
for a week,

05:45.208 --> 05:47.166
Roger gets his
missing person story

05:47.208 --> 05:49.750
and then I get to do my exposé
on Garbage Island.

05:49.792 --> 05:51.041
That's great!

05:51.083 --> 05:52.125
By the time I get back,

05:52.166 --> 05:53.709
everyone will have
forgotten all about

05:53.750 --> 05:55.709
my ignorance of
the fairer sex!

05:55.750 --> 05:56.834
I'm not as concerned about

05:56.875 --> 05:58.917
what you're getting
out of it, but sure.

06:02.625 --> 06:04.291
I rented this cabin
for the next week.

06:04.333 --> 06:05.959
Y-You sure
you'll be okay?

06:06.000 --> 06:07.500
Of course!
I'll be fine.

06:09.291 --> 06:10.250
Geez, Steve.

06:10.291 --> 06:12.000
Four gallons of Lubriderm?

06:12.041 --> 06:14.583
You try living
with eczema.

06:14.625 --> 06:15.709
All right.

06:15.750 --> 06:17.583
Time to report
a disappearance.

06:19.542 --> 06:20.583
Hello?

06:20.625 --> 06:21.667
Genevieve?

06:21.709 --> 06:22.583
It's Hayley.

06:22.625 --> 06:24.083
I think I have
your story.

06:24.125 --> 06:26.333
My little brother
has gone missing!

06:26.375 --> 06:27.583
Steve is missing?!

06:27.625 --> 06:28.917
How horrible for him.

06:28.959 --> 06:30.250
But fantastic for us!

06:30.291 --> 06:31.959
We can make this
national news!

06:32.000 --> 06:35.041
They said I wasn't
good enough for television.

06:35.083 --> 06:37.625
How do you like me now,
voices in my head?

06:37.667 --> 06:40.417
There's no pleasing you guys!

06:40.458 --> 06:41.625
No, not you, Marc.

06:41.667 --> 06:43.333
You're always super positive.

06:45.500 --> 06:47.583

06:47.625 --> 06:48.583

This is News Glance

06:51.834 --> 06:53.792

06:53.834 --> 06:56.375
Sad news out of
Langley Falls tonight,

06:56.417 --> 06:58.667
stunningly gorgeous
high school student,

06:58.709 --> 07:00.750
Steve Smith,
has gone missing.

07:00.792 --> 07:04.083
Athletic. Chiseled. Missing.

07:04.125 --> 07:06.542
All we know right now is that
Steve was last seen at home

07:06.583 --> 07:09.125
with his family
and he is adorable.

07:09.166 --> 07:11.625
This isn't some ugly kid
who went missing. No.

07:11.667 --> 07:13.000
This is a person who matters.

07:13.041 --> 07:15.542
To fully understand
the weight of this tragedy,

07:15.583 --> 07:18.250
let's take a look at some photos
of Steve to the song,

07:18.291 --> 07:20.542
"It's So Hard
to Say Goodbye to Yesterday,"

07:20.583 --> 07:24.041

but, when we come back,
it won't be.

07:57.083 --> 07:58.375

a word from our sponsor,

08:22.166 --> 08:23.417

prayer breakfast numbers.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.542
Yeah. Listen, now that
I got you your hot story,

08:27.583 --> 08:29.750
I get to do my report on
Garbage Island, right?

08:29.792 --> 08:31.208
Yeah. We're definitely
gonna do that.

Officer, please,
find our baby boy.

08:53.417 --> 08:56.458
We're doing everything we can
with the evidence we have.

08:56.500 --> 08:58.000
Which... is...

08:58.041 --> 08:59.291
no evidence.

08:59.333 --> 09:01.500
But we will, uh...

09:01.542 --> 09:04.208
find him?

09:04.250 --> 09:06.917
Whoa. A monkey
holding a banana?!

09:06.959 --> 09:09.583
So many Beanie Babies here
I haven't seen before.

09:09.625 --> 09:10.834
Francine, look at this one!

09:10.875 --> 09:12.750
It's a bear
in a bunny costume.

09:12.792 --> 09:15.750
What are you doing
in a bunny costume, bear?

09:15.792 --> 09:18.333
I'm here with the parents,
Stan and Francine Smith.

09:18.375 --> 09:19.709
Do you folks
have a statement?

09:19.750 --> 09:22.333
I just want
my baby to come home.

09:22.375 --> 09:23.709
Of course you do.

09:23.750 --> 09:25.625
But I'd let yourself
want other things, too.

09:25.667 --> 09:27.083
I mean, we're at a vigil.

09:27.125 --> 09:29.291
It's not like you have those
when things are going great.

09:33.417 --> 09:34.709
If you'll excuse me,

09:34.750 --> 09:36.458
I have to go
comfort my wife now.

09:36.500 --> 09:38.792
I bet a Beanie Baby
would cheer her up.

09:38.834 --> 09:40.166
Like this one.

09:40.208 --> 09:41.417
She might like this one.

09:41.458 --> 09:42.375
This one reminds me of

09:42.417 --> 09:44.083
Abigail Breslin.

09:44.125 --> 09:46.333
Not so much the way it looks,
but its energy.

09:48.583 --> 09:49.834
Great work, Hayley!

09:49.875 --> 09:51.166
This story is
just what I needed.

09:51.208 --> 09:53.500
I know, but I feel awful.

09:53.542 --> 09:54.875
My mom is devastated.

09:54.917 --> 09:56.792
Well, yeah,
her little baby's missing.

09:56.834 --> 09:58.542
Th-That's the thing,
he's...

10:00.041 --> 10:01.625
...he's not really missing.

10:01.667 --> 10:04.250
I, I kind of staged
the whole thing.

10:04.291 --> 10:06.208
Oh, my God, Hayley!

10:06.250 --> 10:08.667
You're a journalist!
What?!

10:08.709 --> 10:09.792
Sure!

10:09.834 --> 10:11.458
We don't report the news,
we make it.

10:11.500 --> 10:13.625
Accuracy is so time-consuming.

10:13.667 --> 10:14.750
Fiction is the new fact.

10:14.792 --> 10:16.709
Roger, these people
need to know that

10:16.750 --> 10:18.291
Steve isn't missing, okay?

10:18.333 --> 10:19.750
I got to come clean on this.

10:19.792 --> 10:21.125
You know what else
has to come clean?

10:21.166 --> 10:22.291
Garbage Island.

10:22.333 --> 10:23.959
Don't you still
want to do your report?

10:24.000 --> 10:25.291
Of course I do!

10:25.333 --> 10:28.208
But, uh,
my mom, she's so torn up.

10:28.250 --> 10:31.291
Look, just let this ride
for one more day, all right?

10:31.333 --> 10:33.208
Besides, the more popular
the story gets,

10:33.250 --> 10:34.333
the more viewers we'll have

10:34.375 --> 10:36.208
for your bummer piece
on Garbage Island.

10:36.250 --> 10:37.417
Fine.

10:37.458 --> 10:38.625
One more day.

10:38.667 --> 10:40.333
All right.
I'm gonna take a lap.

10:40.375 --> 10:43.500
It's super easy to take peoples'
wallets while they're crying.

10:43.542 --> 10:46.333
Justice hunter. Philanthropist.

10:46.375 --> 10:47.834
Has a Gmail account.

10:47.875 --> 10:52.166
This is News Glance
with Genevieve Vavance.

10:52.208 --> 10:54.875
Been a tough day for all of us
here at the Glance.

10:54.917 --> 10:57.709
Steve Smith has now been
missing for 36 hours.

10:57.750 --> 11:00.125
I'm joined by some of
Steve's classmates.

11:00.166 --> 11:01.542
You look like
the type of girls

11:01.583 --> 11:03.125
who do a lot of
regrettable things.

11:03.166 --> 11:04.417
How does it feel today,

11:04.458 --> 11:06.166
knowing you'll probably
never get to hit that?

11:06.208 --> 11:09.041
Sad. Steve was
really cute.

11:09.083 --> 11:11.583
I guess I just wish
I could've hit that.

11:11.583 --> 11:13.875
It's so important
to have sex with people

11:13.917 --> 11:14.917
before they go missing.

11:14.959 --> 11:17.083
Mm-hmm.
Mmm.
Mm-hmm.

11:17.125 --> 11:19.166
All those girls want me?!

11:19.208 --> 11:20.709
Awesome!

11:20.750 --> 11:23.458
The longer I stay in this cabin,
the more laid I'm gonna get!

11:24.291 --> 11:26.208
Yeah.

11:28.792 --> 11:29.667
More volume!

11:29.709 --> 11:31.166
I want it super big!

11:31.208 --> 11:32.750
You're doing a great job.

11:32.792 --> 11:34.834
I know I'm demanding,
but I'm working on it.

11:34.875 --> 11:37.000
But it also got me
where I am today.

11:37.041 --> 11:38.959
So when I ask you to
make it super big,

11:39.000 --> 11:40.417
I mean, make it super big!

11:40.458 --> 11:42.709
I will murder you!

11:42.750 --> 11:44.667
I'm sorry.
Work in progress.

11:44.709 --> 11:47.208
God is not finished
with this gal.

11:48.917 --> 11:51.834
Hey, Genevieve, I'm all set to
do my story on Garbage Island.

11:51.875 --> 11:53.166
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
we'll get to it.

11:53.208 --> 11:55.417
But first, I got an
exclusive with the parents.

11:55.458 --> 11:56.458
Wait. What?!

11:57.834 --> 11:59.000
And we're back.

11:59.041 --> 12:01.500
I'm here tonight
with Stan and Francine Smith,

12:01.542 --> 12:05.917
heartbroken parents of America's
missing son, Steve Smith.

12:05.959 --> 12:09.208
Stan, Francine,

12:09.250 --> 12:10.250
why did you murder your son?

12:10.291 --> 12:12.208
What?!
Not ready to confess?

12:12.250 --> 12:14.041
Let's look at some statistics.

12:14.083 --> 12:17.166
100% of the time a child goes
missing, the parents did it.

12:17.208 --> 12:18.667
Legally not a fact.

12:18.709 --> 12:19.709
What are you talking about?

12:19.750 --> 12:20.959
And where'd you hide the body?

12:21.000 --> 12:22.333
We didn't
hide the body.

12:22.375 --> 12:23.583
So you admit there's a body?!

12:23.625 --> 12:24.709
Why are you doing this?!

12:24.750 --> 12:26.750
I'm sorry.
Its been a long week.

12:26.792 --> 12:27.917
Emotions are running wild.

12:27.959 --> 12:30.000
Can I get you something?
A BeerWater perhaps?

12:30.041 --> 12:32.208
No, thanks.
That stuff gives me diarrhea.

12:36.792 --> 12:38.458
Stan, are you close
with your son?

12:38.500 --> 12:40.417
No, but that doesn't mean
I murdered him!

12:40.458 --> 12:43.041
Interesting.
Can we play that back?

12:43.083 --> 12:44.750
I murdered him!

12:44.792 --> 12:46.750
You son of a bitch!

12:46.792 --> 12:48.333
Oh!

12:48.375 --> 12:49.917
We have
to take a break.

12:49.959 --> 12:51.709
BeerWater...

12:51.750 --> 12:53.375
it won't give you diarrhea.

12:55.041 --> 12:56.917
Just keep it natural.

12:56.959 --> 12:59.542
You guys are doing great.
You're coming off super likable.

12:59.583 --> 13:02.083
Francine, how many times
did you stab your son?

13:02.125 --> 13:04.083
None!
Huh.

13:04.125 --> 13:06.166
Well, my team and I
created a reenactment

13:06.208 --> 13:08.875
of what we believe happened
the night Steve disappeared.

13:10.333 --> 13:12.375
You know what
I've been thinking about lately?

13:12.417 --> 13:15.333
How Steve is the worst?

13:15.375 --> 13:17.542
Yes! I kind of want
to murder him.

13:17.583 --> 13:20.291
Great idea!
We'll use my knife!

13:23.000 --> 13:24.583
Hi, Mom! Hi, Dad!

13:24.625 --> 13:26.583
Just coming in here to love you.

13:34.667 --> 13:38.458
I... forgive... you.

13:47.542 --> 13:49.041
Gruesome stuff.

13:49.083 --> 13:51.375
Can you two stick around
for my next guest? Yeah?

13:51.417 --> 13:53.875
Well, please welcome
Officer Keith Benson!

13:53.917 --> 13:54.750
What?!

13:54.792 --> 13:56.458
Stan and Francine Smith,

13:56.500 --> 13:58.959
you are under arrest for
the murder of your son.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.041
What the hell?!

14:00.083 --> 14:01.125
We didn't kill him!

14:01.166 --> 14:02.458
We love our son!

14:02.500 --> 14:03.959
Wait! Officer, please!

14:04.000 --> 14:05.500
You're making a mistake!

14:06.583 --> 14:07.583
Tragic.

14:07.625 --> 14:09.208
After the break bulimia.

14:09.250 --> 14:11.583
Bad for you,
but is it good for your toilet?

14:11.625 --> 14:13.709
Find out tonight at 11:00.

14:18.542 --> 14:19.709
Are you crazy?!

14:19.750 --> 14:21.917
You let my mom and
dad go to jail?!

14:21.959 --> 14:24.917
Now, I know you're angry, but
try not to let that come through

14:24.959 --> 14:27.709
when you do your report
on Garbage Island, which is now!

14:27.750 --> 14:29.875
Go!

14:29.917 --> 14:34.458
Um... m-mo-most people like to
get wasted on an exotic island,

14:34.500 --> 14:37.250
but this island is waste.

14:38.458 --> 14:40.083
I'm sorry. I can't do this.

14:40.125 --> 14:41.375
Isn't she a trouper?

14:41.417 --> 14:42.583
Still trying to save the world

14:42.625 --> 14:44.291

she learned

that her parents murdered
her little handsome brother.

14:46.792 --> 14:48.542
They murdered her brother!

14:48.583 --> 14:51.417

of my own journalists,

Hayley Smith,
kidnapped her brother

15:36.583 --> 15:39.917
and framed her own parents
for his murder!

15:39.959 --> 15:41.041
Let her take the fall,

Edward? No.

No, you can't be Edward.

16:23.250 --> 16:26.125
Edward weighed at least
25 pounds more than you.

16:26.166 --> 16:28.041
I lost that weight
in the academy.

Thanks, Grobes.
See you next month in Mexico.

18:38.667 --> 18:39.834
Thank you
for being here.

18:39.875 --> 18:41.458
Now, let's start
with the parents.

18:41.500 --> 18:42.667
How thankful are you

18:42.709 --> 18:44.917
that my accusing you of murder
has brought an end

18:44.959 --> 18:46.041
to this terrible ordeal?

18:46.083 --> 18:47.583
On a scale
from 90 to 100.

18:47.625 --> 18:50.125
Then... 90.

18:50.166 --> 18:53.000
90. Wow! Still an A!

18:53.041 --> 18:54.709
They don't just give those out!

18:55.792 --> 18:57.041
And Steve Smith,

18:57.083 --> 18:59.500
here you are, safe, free,

18:59.542 --> 19:00.959
the nightmare
behind you.

19:01.000 --> 19:04.125
Tell us what was it like to
be kidnapped by your own sister?

19:04.166 --> 19:06.166
Well, I...

19:06.208 --> 19:07.166
I'm not sure.

19:07.208 --> 19:08.458
Is that right?

19:08.500 --> 19:10.875
Well, maybe
the teleprompter can help.

19:13.500 --> 19:16.208
Um... I... Well...

19:16.250 --> 19:18.959
Uh, I had heard
that there was never a time

19:19.000 --> 19:20.917
you weren't certain
you were going to die.

19:20.959 --> 19:23.542
Every girl
in that crowd wants you.

19:23.583 --> 19:24.834
Just read the damn prompter.

19:28.959 --> 19:31.542
"My crazy sister locked me up

19:31.583 --> 19:34.125
and made me kiss a raccoon
on the mouth..."

19:34.166 --> 19:36.250
No! That's not true.

19:36.291 --> 19:37.458
None of this is!

19:37.500 --> 19:39.166
Wha-What-What?!

19:39.208 --> 19:40.709
I can't do this.

19:40.750 --> 19:42.250
My sister didn't kidnap me.

19:42.291 --> 19:45.166
I humiliated myself at school,
so she helped me hide.

19:45.208 --> 19:47.000
This entire thing was staged.

19:48.083 --> 19:50.333
And Genevieve Vavance
was in on it.

19:50.375 --> 19:53.709
Yes, I staged
Steve's kidnapping,

19:53.750 --> 19:55.583
but Genevieve Vavance
knew about it.

19:55.625 --> 19:57.667
She had my parents
arrested for a crime

19:57.709 --> 19:59.000
she knew they
didn't commit,

19:59.041 --> 20:01.542
and when I told her to stop,
she framed me, too.

20:01.583 --> 20:03.458
We trusted you!

20:03.500 --> 20:05.083
You're supposed
to be a journalist!

20:05.125 --> 20:07.959
I can't read!
I depend on you!

20:08.000 --> 20:10.291
Whoa!
Aah!

20:10.333 --> 20:13.208
Uh, uh, everyone,
a big hand

20:13.250 --> 20:14.875
for the BeerWater
mermaids!

20:29.208 --> 20:32.375
Hayley, I'm sorry I let
everyone think you kidnapped me.

20:32.417 --> 20:33.417
No, Steve.

20:33.458 --> 20:35.333
I'm the one who owes
you an apology.

20:35.375 --> 20:38.500
I just wanted to be a journalist
and get the truth out there,

20:38.542 --> 20:42.375
but I ended up compromising
all my beliefs along the way.

20:42.417 --> 20:44.542
I learned my lesson.

20:44.583 --> 20:46.542
I'll never be ambitious again.

20:46.583 --> 20:48.917
Hayley, I have no idea
what's going on,

20:48.959 --> 20:51.667
but it sounds like
I should be proud of you.

20:51.709 --> 20:53.041
That ballad
was supposed to be

20:53.083 --> 20:55.333
my "Candle in the Wind,"
you dicks!

21:00.250 --> 21:02.625
All right, I'm gonna do the
bumpers for the next few shows.

21:02.667 --> 21:04.750
Just keep it rollin'.
I ain't doing this twice.

21:04.792 --> 21:07.375
What household item could
kill you in the next half-hour?

21:07.417 --> 21:10.291
We'll tell you tonight...
at 11:00!

21:10.333 --> 21:12.583
Easily surprised?
You'll be shocked

21:12.625 --> 21:14.709
by what you learn
tonight at 11:00.

21:14.750 --> 21:17.125
Texting and driving--
how it may save your life.

21:17.166 --> 21:19.125
Tonight at 11:00!

21:19.166 --> 21:20.709
Is Mario Lopez gay?

21:20.750 --> 21:23.291
We make irresponsible guesses,
tonight at 11:00.

21:23.333 --> 21:25.417
The results will shock him.

21:25.458 --> 21:28.625
Tonight, at 11:00, teens are
having sex younger and younger.

21:28.667 --> 21:29.792
Want to watch?

21:29.834 --> 21:31.458
Bye! Have a beautiful time.
