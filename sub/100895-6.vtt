<i>People long for life</i>
<i>before the Freeze.</i>

00:22.439 --> 00:23.481
<i>But I don't know...</i>

00:25.275 --> 00:26.609
<i>I might like this life better.</i>

00:37.203 --> 00:38.371
<i>I think of my mum,</i>

00:39.873 --> 00:44.335
<i>chain-smoking at the kitchen table,</i>
<i>fresh bruises under last night's makeup.</i>

00:45.795 --> 00:50.133
<i>"Keep your head on a swivel," she'd say,</i>
<i>"'cause trouble comes sideways."</i>

00:53.178 --> 00:55.013
<i>It's a zero-sum world now.</i>

00:56.514 --> 00:59.893
<i>You set a thing in motion</i>
<i>and watch it tumble down the line.</i>

01:03.563 --> 01:05.273
<i>All that's coming is coming head on.</i>

01:06.941 --> 01:10.195
<i>The whole great shitshow</i>
<i>flattened down into a single line.</i>

01:13.323 --> 01:15.575
<i>To climb, someone else falls. </i>

01:15.658 --> 01:17.660
<i>To gain, someone else loses.</i>

01:19.287 --> 01:21.039
<i>And roundy round we go...</i>

01:23.291 --> 01:24.751
<i>1001 cars long.</i>

01:55.782 --> 01:58.284
Subtrain, platform 312. Electrical short.

01:59.202 --> 02:00.245
I'll go.

02:01.496 --> 02:03.581
Sure have all the fun jobs, man.

02:03.665 --> 02:05.458
And you don't even have
to follow protocol.

02:05.542 --> 02:07.210
Isn't that nice?

02:07.293 --> 02:08.503
What do you want, Javi?

02:09.129 --> 02:11.464
You want to invoke Wilford's
"no fraternizing in the Engine" rule,

02:11.548 --> 02:12.382
is that it?

02:12.465 --> 02:15.135
Hey, when she first took this train,
she said we'd follow his order.

02:17.428 --> 02:19.806
But I guess if she can turn a trial
into a total sham,

02:21.057 --> 02:22.225
she can shag the help, too, right?

02:27.230 --> 02:29.315
You know, Javi,
it's almost been seven years.

02:30.733 --> 02:32.193
Maybe you should find a girlfriend.

02:34.487 --> 02:36.281
Only I'd have to lie to her, too.

02:37.323 --> 02:39.450
Focus on your breath.

02:42.620 --> 02:44.914
You're squirming. Be in the moment.

02:44.998 --> 02:46.332
Yep, I'm in the moment.

02:47.625 --> 02:51.504
Just some other moments
I kind of need to be in.

02:51.588 --> 02:52.797
Mel.

03:00.305 --> 03:02.891
-Are your eyes open?
-No.

03:03.558 --> 03:07.604
-You're useless. You can't even try?

03:07.687 --> 03:10.732
I'm sorry, Jinju.
Just not feeling it today.

03:10.815 --> 03:12.984
- Heard about the strike?

03:14.110 --> 03:15.111
Strike?

03:15.987 --> 03:17.906
-Yeah. Can you zip me?
-Yeah.

03:17.989 --> 03:18.990
Look.

03:21.284 --> 03:22.952
They're circulating all through Third.

03:23.620 --> 03:26.331
-It's blowback from the trial.
-Shit.

03:27.540 --> 03:29.584
They can cripple
every system on the train.

03:29.667 --> 03:30.919
Yes, they could.

03:31.628 --> 03:33.004
They'd suffer along with the rest of us.

03:33.087 --> 03:35.214
They're putting the gun to their own head.

03:35.298 --> 03:38.468
Well, it seems like to pull
the balance of power their way,

03:39.344 --> 03:40.720
they're willing to risk it.

03:41.721 --> 03:42.764
What are you gonna do?

03:44.182 --> 03:46.935
I'm going to crush it.

03:49.437 --> 03:54.400
Hey, I forgot to ask you.
How was last night? With Till?

03:54.484 --> 03:58.071
Mmm. There was no last night.
She never showed up.

03:59.697 --> 04:00.698
That's weird.

04:08.748 --> 04:09.999
Ah. Brakeman Till.

04:10.083 --> 04:12.710
Where have you been?
I looked for you all night.

04:13.795 --> 04:14.963
And why's that, then?

04:17.340 --> 04:19.050
Listen, Osweiller,
I'm sorry about what happened.

04:19.133 --> 04:21.636
-I made a split decision, a bad--

04:22.428 --> 04:26.975
Well, we've got time for that later.
We have law enforcement work to be doing.

04:27.558 --> 04:30.019
Follow me. Fix yourself up, yeah?

04:40.905 --> 04:42.949
It's okay. You're okay.

04:43.032 --> 04:45.493
It's okay, you're awake.
You were just dreaming. You were dreaming.

04:51.958 --> 04:54.794
How'd I get here?

04:58.214 --> 04:59.424
Josie brought you.

05:00.967 --> 05:03.469
She said they put you in a drawer.

05:04.846 --> 05:05.930
Andre, what happened?

05:10.643 --> 05:11.602
What did you do?

05:11.686 --> 05:12.729
What did I do?

05:14.731 --> 05:17.150
I did what they asked me.
I solved their crime.

05:17.233 --> 05:18.693
Then why would they punish you?

05:18.776 --> 05:21.612
Careful what you wish for, huh?

05:22.196 --> 05:25.825
You drag me out of the Tail.
You tell me that you love me.

05:25.908 --> 05:27.076
I almost believed it.

05:27.160 --> 05:28.619
-So did I!
-We ended that night!

05:28.703 --> 05:30.413
I don't want to talk about that night.

05:30.496 --> 05:32.373
You should've kept your hands clean!

05:32.457 --> 05:34.500
You should've left me out of it!

05:34.584 --> 05:38.212
Then all of this rage that you feel,
all the blame, then it would've been pure!

05:38.296 --> 05:39.130
Andre!

05:51.184 --> 05:52.685
Are you gonna turn me in?

05:56.647 --> 05:57.648
No.

06:15.249 --> 06:16.084
Bitch!

06:17.585 --> 06:22.006
Corrupt Wilford whore. Fascist scum.

06:22.632 --> 06:24.550
- Silence!

06:32.016 --> 06:38.856
It has come to Mr. Wilford's attention
that a work stoppage is planned for today.

06:40.316 --> 06:46.155
Mr. Wilford would like to remind you
that your labor is sacred.

06:46.823 --> 06:53.079
As nonpaying passengers,
it is also your ticket aboard.

06:54.205 --> 06:55.790
These are the terms.

06:57.125 --> 07:00.044
We all have our places and our jobs,

07:00.128 --> 07:02.255
-and Mr. Wilford expects--
-We keep this train running!

07:02.338 --> 07:03.881
- Yeah!
- We have the numbers!

07:03.965 --> 07:05.633
We will be heard!

07:13.891 --> 07:14.809
Enough!

07:14.892 --> 07:17.854
You better finish up
before the top pops off of this place.

07:19.480 --> 07:21.816
If this work stoppage goes ahead,

07:22.442 --> 07:27.613
Mr. Wilford will seize
ten striking workers at random...

07:28.114 --> 07:30.700
-and send them to the Tail.

07:31.284 --> 07:34.537
He will bring ten Tailies
forward to fill their posts.

07:36.247 --> 07:38.207
You think life in Third is bad?

07:39.125 --> 07:43.671
There are 400 souls downtrain...

07:44.964 --> 07:48.134
who would kill for what you have!

07:49.010 --> 07:50.136
Protect it.

07:51.596 --> 07:52.889
Call off the strike.

07:56.934 --> 07:57.935
Thank you.

08:06.694 --> 08:07.570
Josie?

08:13.159 --> 08:14.368
How are you feeling?

08:15.286 --> 08:16.537
Back from the dead.

08:22.585 --> 08:26.005
-We've got to get you out of here.
-To where? He can barely stand up.

08:26.088 --> 08:29.091
When they discover he's missing,
this'll be the first place they look.

08:29.175 --> 08:31.093
I've made arrangements.
Someone who's willing to help.

08:34.931 --> 08:36.307
Will I see you again?

08:37.391 --> 08:40.102
There can be no more contact.
It's for your own good.

08:40.186 --> 08:41.395
I'm not the enemy...

08:43.314 --> 08:44.315
Andre.

09:01.415 --> 09:02.917
Okay. Okay.

09:04.377 --> 09:07.421
How are you getting out of the Tail?

09:07.505 --> 09:08.673
Sanitation.

09:09.465 --> 09:13.010
Astrid swaps in with me,
gives me four hours uptrain.

09:13.928 --> 09:15.763
We arrange it all through the bug bars.

09:17.765 --> 09:22.186
-You've been busy.
-Yeah, thanks to your chip.

09:29.777 --> 09:32.572
-We've got to go.
-I need to tell you something...

09:33.406 --> 09:34.949
in case anything happens to me.

09:35.032 --> 09:37.994
Layton, you are gonna be fine.
We're gonna get you help.

09:38.077 --> 09:39.704
Wilford's not on the train.

09:41.247 --> 09:44.750
That's why I was drawered,
because I figured her out.

09:44.834 --> 09:46.168
-Layton, Layton--
-Listen to me.

09:47.712 --> 09:50.339
Wilford is an illusion
to keep the rest of us in line.

09:50.423 --> 09:53.050
Melanie Cavill is the one
behind the curtain.

09:58.556 --> 10:00.850
No one can know. Not even the Tail.

10:00.933 --> 10:02.727
Not till we figure out
how we can use this.

10:02.810 --> 10:04.979
Okay. All right.

10:06.772 --> 10:08.858
-We've gotta go. We've gotta go.

10:41.223 --> 10:42.224
Shit.

10:52.026 --> 10:53.110
I've been here.

10:55.571 --> 10:57.365
Christ. What a picture.

10:57.990 --> 11:01.035
-You.
-Come. Come on. Quickly.

11:06.624 --> 11:08.709
On the slab, Detective.
Let's take a look.

11:09.335 --> 11:12.505
-I'm... I'm fine!
-Give me your arm.

11:15.675 --> 11:19.261
Puking all night? Coughing up black fluid?

11:19.345 --> 11:21.472
That drawer hangover is a whopper.

11:22.390 --> 11:24.308
Let her check you. Let her check you.

11:25.059 --> 11:26.977
How's his mind? He seem rational?

11:27.561 --> 11:30.314
Some people come out like vegetables.
Others are agitated, impulsive.

11:30.898 --> 11:33.109
Why do you know so much about the Drawers?

11:33.192 --> 11:34.443
I'll put you down as "agitated."

11:34.527 --> 11:36.737
I reached out to our allies, okay?

11:36.821 --> 11:39.990
I told them you were sick.
They made contact with Dr. Pelton for me.

11:40.658 --> 11:42.410
Tissue damage is limited.

11:43.411 --> 11:46.747
As for your melon,
it could be days before the fog clears.

11:46.831 --> 11:47.873
You need rest.

11:47.957 --> 11:50.459
You work with them, that it?

11:52.128 --> 11:58.175
Klimpt? Melanie Cavill?
You help them with their science?

11:59.635 --> 12:03.222
I do medicals on the prisoners
who are released, nothing more.

12:03.305 --> 12:05.307
They're not prisoners. They're lab rats.

12:05.391 --> 12:07.601
-What the hell's going on down there?
-I'm not cleared to know.

12:07.685 --> 12:08.561
-So guess!
-Hey.

12:14.984 --> 12:18.696
It's not just the one car.
There's 11 more like it.

12:19.447 --> 12:21.657
Full of drawers. Hundreds of 'em.

12:22.283 --> 12:23.242
What for?

12:23.325 --> 12:27.580
Mass incarceration, human experiments,
extrajudicial imprisonment.

12:27.663 --> 12:31.167
It's her own little North Korea
tucked away in Second Class.

12:35.254 --> 12:36.922
How long are you gonna keep this up?

12:37.965 --> 12:40.551
Osweiller? What do you want from me?

12:41.343 --> 12:45.055
You know what would be nice?
Some fresh scallops from the ocean.

12:45.806 --> 12:47.349
You leave Jinju out of this.

12:47.433 --> 12:50.102
You think? 'Cause, you know,
if what you did comes out,

12:50.186 --> 12:53.063
you'll lose your job.
Probably an arm, too.

12:53.147 --> 12:56.901
And Jinju, well, she'll just drop you
like the piece of rough that you are.

12:57.526 --> 13:01.989
So here's what I want, Till.
Every last thing I can get.

13:02.907 --> 13:05.242
-Yeah, you've made that clear.

13:06.285 --> 13:10.831
There's fun to be had
on this train, and I plan to have some.

13:12.208 --> 13:14.877
And now that we all know
you're as dirty as they come,

13:15.586 --> 13:18.422
you're gonna have to play along,
aren't you? Hmm?

13:20.549 --> 13:23.511
Walter the papermaker,
got some questions for you.

13:24.845 --> 13:26.013
Where'd this come from?

13:26.555 --> 13:30.059
It's got nothing to do with me.
It's, uh, homemade stock.

13:30.935 --> 13:33.270
No, I can see that. May I?

13:39.235 --> 13:43.989
Whoever made this needed supplies.
Anyone come to you asking?

13:44.073 --> 13:47.243
Uh, no. Like I said,
I don't know anything about it and--

13:49.245 --> 13:51.789
Please, help.

13:51.872 --> 13:53.165
What do you reckon, Till?

13:53.749 --> 13:56.502
This fine citizen is in some distress.
You gonna help him?

13:56.585 --> 13:58.337
-Answer the question.

13:58.420 --> 14:01.215
Okay, okay. It was Clay.

14:02.049 --> 14:03.592
In... in the Nightcar.

14:08.138 --> 14:11.433
Let's go, partner. This is fun.

14:16.689 --> 14:22.903
She was a warrior. She fought like hell.
And she loved you kids more than anything.

14:22.987 --> 14:25.865
Winnie. Winnie, come on.

14:29.076 --> 14:31.537
Our next of kin decides on burial rites.

14:32.121 --> 14:33.664
What do you want, a song?

14:35.749 --> 14:38.836
Want a prayer? Hey, come on, lad.

14:40.212 --> 14:43.090
You're the head of the family now.
You need to be strong for your sister.

14:45.342 --> 14:46.635
No ceremony. Call for Disposal.

14:48.929 --> 14:49.972
Okay.

14:50.598 --> 14:54.226
Winnie... Come on, Winnie. We gotta go.

14:55.060 --> 14:58.355
-I really want my mommy. My mama.
- Come on. I know.

15:00.524 --> 15:02.151
I hate this shit.

15:04.987 --> 15:08.282
I want to do something for them,
for everybody. Just lift spirits.

15:08.365 --> 15:09.199
Yeah.

15:10.159 --> 15:11.785
I need your help, Auss.

15:13.037 --> 15:15.247
<i>We need to see beyond the Tail.</i>

15:23.756 --> 15:25.299
Fancy meeting you here.

15:26.300 --> 15:28.052
Fancy meeting you anywhere.

15:29.553 --> 15:32.014
We should run away
to Tahiti together, you know.

15:32.097 --> 15:33.599
And leave all this?

15:34.850 --> 15:36.018
What have we got here?

15:36.685 --> 15:39.647
Electrical short.
Caused the brakes to seize.

15:46.946 --> 15:48.447
Well, we better get
a Breach team on standby.

15:48.530 --> 15:52.034
-Nah, we can free that brake.
-Bogie motor can't take that heat.

15:54.536 --> 15:55.371
Hear that?

15:57.331 --> 16:00.459
Yeah. I'll get the Breach team.
We'll have to swap that motor out.

16:16.433 --> 16:18.811
You risk an awful lot, taking us in.

16:18.894 --> 16:21.814
Comes a point when you can't
stay on the sidelines any longer.

16:21.897 --> 16:24.942
Seven years is a long time.
What changed?

16:25.025 --> 16:27.987
Hey, ease up, Layton. She's on our side.

16:28.070 --> 16:30.447
No, no. He's... He's right.

16:33.492 --> 16:36.412
Passenger files.
Everyone on board has one.

16:37.287 --> 16:40.290
Medical history, entitlements, housing.

16:41.208 --> 16:43.043
And then there's this.

16:43.752 --> 16:46.755
Roughly one in ten passengers
has that designation.

16:46.839 --> 16:51.552
-What does it mean?
-There's rumors of a list. Blacklist.

16:52.720 --> 16:53.846
Enemies of the State.

16:54.513 --> 16:57.016
I think this is it.

16:57.599 --> 16:59.977
- Why?
- Because you're on it.

17:01.061 --> 17:02.062
Both of ya.

17:05.691 --> 17:09.028
And as of two weeks ago, so am I.

17:10.946 --> 17:12.531
It gets real simple, doesn't it?

17:14.867 --> 17:16.493
When you're the one they coming for.

17:26.420 --> 17:30.257
Before Freeze, many people know cold.

17:31.550 --> 17:38.474
On <i>Snowpiercer,</i>
only Breach worker know real cold.

17:39.641 --> 17:41.602
The new cold.

17:42.853 --> 17:44.646
And she is harsh.

17:46.607 --> 17:48.067
And she bite.

17:51.820 --> 17:56.700
Breach worker are only one
who can dance with cold.

17:57.618 --> 18:01.288
And if you listen... Down. Everybody down.

18:03.457 --> 18:08.670
You can hear the music
she play just for us.

18:11.090 --> 18:13.592
-Sorry to interrupt.
- Not at all.

18:13.675 --> 18:15.219
Mr. Wilford needs you downtrain.

18:15.302 --> 18:16.303
Okey-dokey.

18:17.012 --> 18:21.141
Now, remember, children, when Freeze come,

18:21.683 --> 18:26.271
the world, she owe everything to who?

18:26.355 --> 18:27.356
To Wilford!

18:29.191 --> 18:31.985
-To who?
- To Wilford!

18:32.069 --> 18:33.570
To Wilford.

18:34.655 --> 18:36.115
Thank you for coming.

18:36.198 --> 18:37.991
All right, back to work, everybody.

18:38.575 --> 18:40.369
How's young Miles and Miles?

18:41.537 --> 18:44.039
I finished that exercise you gave me,
Ms. Cavill.

18:46.959 --> 18:48.460
You did this all by yourself?

18:48.544 --> 18:51.547
It's easier by myself.
I see it like pictures.

18:52.714 --> 18:54.800
I think maybe you should be teaching me.

18:54.883 --> 18:57.136
- Great work, Miles.

19:20.784 --> 19:21.827
Talk to me.

19:23.162 --> 19:26.915
I feel like I've lived so many lives
and died so many times.

19:28.250 --> 19:31.170
The Freeze, the Tail, the Chains.

19:32.963 --> 19:34.214
It never ends.

19:35.716 --> 19:37.092
I don't have your courage.

19:37.676 --> 19:39.011
That's not what I see.

19:41.722 --> 19:45.434
If you go through with this strike,
you could end up in the Tail.

19:46.685 --> 19:49.521
Bad as you think it is back there,
trust me, it's worse.

19:49.605 --> 19:51.732
And you got out.

19:52.941 --> 19:54.943
That did take courage, Zarah.

19:55.652 --> 19:59.156
We're fighters.
We protect the things we love.

20:10.542 --> 20:13.337
Congratulations.

20:16.131 --> 20:17.841
Congratulations!

20:20.093 --> 20:21.094
Thank you.

20:22.846 --> 20:24.473
<i>Attention, all passengers.</i>

20:24.556 --> 20:27.976
<i>There's been a mechanical disruption</i>
<i>in car 780.</i>

20:28.060 --> 20:30.729
<i>The section will be temporarily cleared</i>
<i>as a precaution,</i>

20:30.812 --> 20:34.274
and Third Class subtrain is restricted
until further notice.

20:34.858 --> 20:39.029
We apologize for the inconvenience,
and we thank you for your cooperation.

20:39.112 --> 20:41.907
I've got to get back to Sanitation.
Dr. Pelton's gonna stay with you.

20:41.990 --> 20:45.452
That's her.
She's even the goddamn voice of the train.

20:45.535 --> 20:47.204
One thing at a time, okay?

20:51.833 --> 20:53.252
Get some rest.

20:55.003 --> 20:57.798
Hey. He's gonna be fine.
It's just gonna take time.

20:57.881 --> 20:59.591
I can't thank you enough.

21:02.094 --> 21:03.303
He stole my chip.

21:04.680 --> 21:07.683
Layton. Layton! Layton!

21:11.353 --> 21:12.354
Holy shit.

21:17.359 --> 21:19.444
- Layton! Layton!

21:20.654 --> 21:23.699
Layton! Stop. Stop! Stop!

21:23.782 --> 21:25.284
She told me where she is.
I can get to her.

21:25.367 --> 21:27.452
-No, you're not thinking straight.
-She doesn't know I'm out.

21:27.536 --> 21:29.288
I might never get
another chance like this.

21:29.371 --> 21:30.622
Come back inside. You need to rest.

21:30.706 --> 21:32.791
We can talk about this tomorrow.
Make a plan, okay?

21:33.458 --> 21:36.003
God damn it, Layton. Layton!

21:36.795 --> 21:38.297
Oh, shit!

21:43.010 --> 21:45.929
First would like specifics
about the mechanical issue.

21:46.013 --> 21:49.099
It's a bogie motor swap out. It's routine.

21:49.683 --> 21:51.935
Lucky you,
you get to put on some grubbies.

21:52.561 --> 21:55.230
Wilford wants my eyes on it.
You know how he is.

21:55.814 --> 21:57.316
Mmm. I thought I did.

21:59.192 --> 22:02.654
Can I ask you something?
How does he seem to you these days?

22:03.864 --> 22:04.823
Why do you ask?

22:05.949 --> 22:07.075
Well, I mean...

22:07.784 --> 22:12.331
he seems to be back on form today,
thank God, but this business in Third...

22:12.414 --> 22:15.375
I mean, to be honest,
I think he asked for it,

22:15.459 --> 22:18.003
indulging them at the trial like that.

22:18.086 --> 22:20.797
You cannot spare the rod
with these people, you know.

22:20.881 --> 22:21.923
You've got to hammer down.

22:22.007 --> 22:27.012
Ruth, remember, "Calm Hospitality..."

22:29.639 --> 22:31.683
-"Calm train."
-"...calm train."

22:44.237 --> 22:48.075
All right, Boki. She's out.
Let's lift her up.

22:49.951 --> 22:52.120
Move! Move! Move!
Let's go! Let's go!

23:11.389 --> 23:13.517
Hook up the motor.
Let's get her out.

23:24.152 --> 23:26.488
-Layton.
-Hello, Mr. Wilford.

23:30.325 --> 23:31.827
Catch up, DiMarco. Catch up.

23:31.910 --> 23:35.539
I know what you're doing.
You have hundreds of names.

23:35.622 --> 23:39.084
Your lists. Anyone has a bad word,
has an unsanctioned thought,

23:39.167 --> 23:40.585
they get thrown in a drawer, yeah?

23:41.753 --> 23:43.338
- More?
- Yes, yes, yes!

23:43.421 --> 23:44.339
I need her up here!

23:44.422 --> 23:45.841
-Up here! Keep going.
- Okay, up we go.

23:46.424 --> 23:47.717
No, you don't understand.

23:47.801 --> 23:51.596
Look at my face.
It was a Tailie that got you in the end.

23:53.306 --> 23:54.432
- Shit!

23:54.516 --> 23:56.601
-DiMarco!
- DiMarco! No!

24:10.657 --> 24:15.704
<i>Warning, please brace.</i>
<i>Emergency lockdown in effect.</i>

24:21.877 --> 24:24.629
- What was that? We got trouble.
- <i>Warning, please brace.</i>

24:24.713 --> 24:26.381
<i>Emergency lockdown in effect.</i>

24:38.059 --> 24:40.395
Okay, all right.
Stay back. Back, back!

24:40.478 --> 24:42.022
You good? Come on.

24:42.105 --> 24:44.149
Okay.

24:44.232 --> 24:45.066
Okay.

24:46.902 --> 24:49.738
Layton, let me go.
The train needs me.

24:51.948 --> 24:53.033
Uh-uh.

24:54.618 --> 24:55.827
The Drawers aren't what you think.

24:55.911 --> 24:58.872
The Drawers are hell,
and my people are still in there.

24:58.955 --> 25:01.917
They're not a prison. They're a lifeboat.

25:02.959 --> 25:08.465
We're hanging by our nails.
Layton, we're hanging by our nails.

25:08.548 --> 25:13.386
The whole goddamn human experiment,
it can be undone by a bloom of mold.

25:14.512 --> 25:17.891
If the social order collapses,
if resources fail,

25:17.974 --> 25:22.103
if mechanics fail, our best hope
is to keep life in suspension,

25:22.187 --> 25:25.357
to keep people in stasis
while we ride out this Freeze.

25:25.440 --> 25:29.819
Four hundred people. They were selected
for diversity, for health, for skills.

25:29.903 --> 25:32.948
To give us a fighting chance
on the other side.

25:33.031 --> 25:34.491
You decide who lives and who dies.

25:34.574 --> 25:36.826
No. We all made that choice.

25:37.410 --> 25:41.498
When we boarded this train
and we left people behind.

25:43.708 --> 25:47.462
This train's dying, Layton.
Please let me fix her.

26:21.830 --> 26:24.291
We have a master hydraulics failure.
I need the controller.

26:24.374 --> 26:25.542
I'll go.

26:27.419 --> 26:28.461
Okay.

26:28.545 --> 26:30.005
- You've got it?
- Yeah.

26:44.102 --> 26:45.312
Come on. Come on.

26:46.813 --> 26:47.731
Yeah?

26:48.523 --> 26:49.482
Telemetry failure.

26:49.566 --> 26:52.527
I'm not getting any readings
from the pistons on that side. Nothing.

26:52.610 --> 26:57.532
Must be the connector, something physical.
I'm gonna suit up. I gotta go under.

27:03.663 --> 27:05.832
Let me go, Mel. Let me go.

27:05.915 --> 27:07.959
This is cold work.
Only Boki should be going.

27:08.043 --> 27:10.628
Busted hydraulics, Boki.
You don't know the specs.

27:11.171 --> 27:12.797
And I need you on diagnostics.

27:15.467 --> 27:16.384
Javi, can you hear me?

27:16.468 --> 27:18.261
<i>What the hell's going on, guys?</i>
<i>Talk to me.</i>

27:18.345 --> 27:20.388
Hey, take us down to dead minimum speed.

27:21.097 --> 27:23.516
And where are we?
How long till Torreta Canyon?

27:24.100 --> 27:26.561
I'm taking her down. But at minimum speed,

27:26.644 --> 27:30.482
the canyon's gonna be
about eight minutes to the Engine.

27:31.066 --> 27:33.526
-How long till us?
<i>-Fourteen minutes to you. Why?</i>

27:33.610 --> 27:37.906
Because at this angle,
when this car hits Torreta Canyon,

27:37.989 --> 27:39.491
the whole train's gonna derail.

27:41.117 --> 27:42.410
Holy shit.

27:42.494 --> 27:45.246
Yeah. "Holy shit" is right.

27:48.792 --> 27:52.629
I designed her. I'll fix her.

27:54.172 --> 27:55.507
Seal me in.

28:01.221 --> 28:02.680
Go, go, go.

28:04.391 --> 28:06.142
You're a dick, you know that?

28:07.018 --> 28:09.437
I'm not gonna stand by
while you abuse people.

28:11.314 --> 28:13.942
-We're about to die, Till.
-Fine, then these are my last words.

28:14.025 --> 28:17.445
I won't let you extort me.
And you're a dick.

28:17.529 --> 28:20.323
I don't get you.
You're so righteous on the small stuff,

28:20.407 --> 28:22.492
but pretty darn flexible
when it comes to high crimes.

28:22.575 --> 28:24.119
Layton shouldn't have been in the Drawers.

28:24.202 --> 28:25.370
And you shouldn't have knocked me out.

28:25.453 --> 28:28.790
Something's going on. Don't you ever feel
like you're being kept in the dark?

28:36.131 --> 28:37.173
Osweiller...

28:39.300 --> 28:41.010
who are you thinking about right now?

28:42.011 --> 28:44.681
No one, just me. Bugger off.

28:52.313 --> 28:54.733
Torches out! Lights off!

28:54.816 --> 28:55.650
Lights out!

28:55.734 --> 28:59.237
I want to show you something
you haven't seen in a long, long time.

29:02.407 --> 29:03.992
Hey, look at that.

29:04.075 --> 29:05.785
Is that
what the outside looks like?

29:05.869 --> 29:06.703
Nice.

29:17.213 --> 29:18.715
Camera feed online.

29:35.815 --> 29:36.983
Oh, God.

29:41.446 --> 29:42.614
Ladies and gentlemen,

29:43.573 --> 29:46.534
<i>on behalf of Mr. Wilford</i>
<i>and Wilford Industries,</i>

29:47.160 --> 29:49.579
<i>we would like to thank you</i>
<i>for your composure</i>

29:49.662 --> 29:51.956
<i>and cooperation during this trying time.</i>

29:56.586 --> 29:58.797
<i>As we prepare</i>
<i>for possible derailment,</i>

29:59.422 --> 30:03.343
<i>we ask that you please remember</i>
<i>your in-transit safety directive. </i>

30:04.969 --> 30:10.016
<i>Brace in place. I repeat, brace in place. </i>

30:15.980 --> 30:19.108
We beg that all passengers remain calm...

30:20.985 --> 30:24.030
<i>in the face of this</i>
<i>unprecedented emergency.</i>

30:33.998 --> 30:38.044
Guys, I'm at the bridge.
I repeat, the Engine's at the bridge.

30:38.127 --> 30:41.339
Six minutes, Mel. We've got six minutes.

30:42.131 --> 30:43.383
Opening now.

30:56.646 --> 31:00.817
Jesus Christ. This is crazy.
This is crazy.

31:08.116 --> 31:10.326
<i>It should be directly</i>
<i>in front of you, Mel.</i>

31:10.410 --> 31:12.787
<i>Don't reach out too far for that thing.</i>

31:19.878 --> 31:22.463
<i>Grab it! Grab it, Mel.</i>
<i>Go, go, go!</i>

31:27.010 --> 31:28.344
-Shit.

31:39.105 --> 31:42.567
I know it seems
like this might be the end...

31:44.360 --> 31:45.445
but it's not.

31:47.196 --> 31:48.281
It can't be.

31:52.327 --> 31:54.913
<i>This is </i>Snowpiercer,<i> for God's sake. </i>

31:57.040 --> 32:01.711
We are the last of Earth's survivors.
And I just...

32:04.797 --> 32:09.969
We are going to make it. I just know it.

32:13.306 --> 32:14.933
<i>We just will.</i>

32:16.476 --> 32:19.187
<i>Mr. Wilford has gotten us out</i>
<i>of worse scrapes before.</i>

32:20.521 --> 32:22.231
<i>So keep the faith...</i>

32:23.316 --> 32:29.197
and you just remember
that his Engine always provides.

32:32.075 --> 32:33.493
So find someone...

32:34.911 --> 32:36.537
<i>and hold them close.</i>

32:39.582 --> 32:40.708
<i>And please... </i>

32:43.378 --> 32:44.837
<i>try to stay warm.</i>

33:08.236 --> 33:12.407
You shit. You shit! You shit!
You shit!

33:12.490 --> 33:14.826
-Did you do it? Did you do it?
-No.

33:16.619 --> 33:19.497
The damage to the train is bad, Josie.

33:21.874 --> 33:24.252
All I could think was I wanted to see you.

33:38.099 --> 33:40.351
Eighty seconds, Mel. Eighty seconds.

33:43.354 --> 33:45.481
<i>All right, Mel, you've got it.</i>
<i>You've got it, Mel.</i>

33:45.565 --> 33:47.233
<i>You've got this.</i>

34:10.048 --> 34:13.176
Come on! Come on, Mel!

34:13.760 --> 34:16.637
<i>Sixty seconds. Sixty seconds.</i>

34:37.033 --> 34:39.911
<i>Come on! Come on!</i>
<i>Come on! Come on!</i>

34:41.120 --> 34:43.372
-We can go back for her.
-You okay, Mel? You all right?

34:43.456 --> 34:45.500
Hold on a second, Boki.
You all right, Mel?

34:45.583 --> 34:47.001
<i>I'm okay.</i>

35:09.816 --> 35:11.109
Yes!

35:11.818 --> 35:15.363
-Hydraulics are online. Yes!

35:19.742 --> 35:22.245
Increase
to running velocity, Javi.

35:22.870 --> 35:24.288
All right, guys,
I'm bringing her up to speed.

35:31.754 --> 35:36.050
<i>All clear.</i>
<i>Return to stations. All clear.</i>

35:45.810 --> 35:47.019
You okay, Clay?

36:28.102 --> 36:31.731
I was thinking about my mum.
At the end, if you must know.

36:33.816 --> 36:35.109
You miss her?

36:35.193 --> 36:36.819
Oh, God, no. She was trash.

36:37.528 --> 36:39.906
She was a mean drunk, even worse sober,
but, yeah...

36:41.866 --> 36:43.534
that's who I was thinking about.

36:45.119 --> 36:46.662
They're gonna catch Layton eventually.

36:48.915 --> 36:51.709
It's gonna come out what you did,
whether I spill it or not.

36:52.960 --> 36:56.505
All right, partner.
You should, uh, go find your girl.

37:02.428 --> 37:04.805
- There she is.

37:24.492 --> 37:26.160
- Okay.
-Nice, nice, nicely.

37:27.703 --> 37:29.622
- Okay.

37:29.705 --> 37:32.250
Ten fingers, one nose.

37:32.333 --> 37:34.418
Okay, okay. We did.

37:38.089 --> 37:40.633
You are kind of amazing.

37:43.552 --> 37:44.971
Piece of cake.

38:21.590 --> 38:22.675
You're okay.

38:25.219 --> 38:26.470
It's okay.

38:32.518 --> 38:37.898
I'm sorry. I should have been here.
I should have shown up for you last night.

38:37.982 --> 38:40.067
It doesn't matter. You're here now.

38:43.029 --> 38:44.447
Is there something else?

38:49.076 --> 38:51.871
What... what if I'm not the person
you think I am?

38:53.164 --> 38:54.457
What's going on?

38:56.042 --> 38:57.418
You can talk to me.

38:59.128 --> 39:00.129
Nothing.

39:02.506 --> 39:05.426
I'm just happy to be here.

39:11.098 --> 39:12.224
I need a drink.

39:28.949 --> 39:32.995
I want beer. I want beer.
You give me your beer. Okay.

39:35.373 --> 39:38.626
Everybody drink now. This is beautiful.

39:38.709 --> 39:39.794
Hey, you.

39:42.421 --> 39:43.422
Thank you!

39:44.048 --> 39:45.299
Quiet down!

39:46.133 --> 39:49.428
Quiet down! Thank you.

39:50.179 --> 39:52.014
People of <i>Snowpiercer... </i>

39:54.975 --> 39:56.560
touch a surface.

39:56.644 --> 39:59.605
Go on, put your hand
to something, anything.

40:00.314 --> 40:01.232
Go on.

40:02.775 --> 40:03.859
Feel it.

40:05.486 --> 40:06.570
Take it in.

40:08.656 --> 40:12.493
That is our sacred hum.

40:15.621 --> 40:17.206
That's our heartbeat.

40:19.125 --> 40:21.085
And she is roaring!

40:23.963 --> 40:27.258
It's gonna take more than
a bit of track turbulence to stop us.

40:28.759 --> 40:32.763
-A toast to the Engine Eternal.

40:34.932 --> 40:36.767
To the great Mr. Wilford.

40:37.643 --> 40:43.357
Wilford! Wilford! Wilford! Wilford!

40:43.441 --> 40:44.650
Come on!

40:49.488 --> 40:52.575
Looks like the people of Third
have had a change of heart.

40:52.658 --> 40:55.744
The celebration will end,
but their grievances won't.

40:55.828 --> 40:58.706
Next time, he won't have
a disaster to save him.

40:58.789 --> 40:59.957
Hey, Audrey.

41:01.542 --> 41:02.585
Read the room.

41:04.295 --> 41:05.421
We're alive.

41:07.381 --> 41:09.550
What about Boki, everyone?

41:09.633 --> 41:12.887
Boki! Boki! Boki! Boki! Boki!

41:17.766 --> 41:20.561
Well, it's not the Tail,
but I hope it'll do.

41:25.858 --> 41:27.651
- Are you sure about this?
-Ah.

41:27.735 --> 41:30.070
I bunk with a guy from Archives
from time to time.

41:30.154 --> 41:33.282
Snores like a leaf blower,
but I'll suffer through.

41:33.365 --> 41:34.325
Thank you.

41:34.408 --> 41:36.535
It's nice to see you
back among the living.

41:36.619 --> 41:37.870
Uh, keep the door locked.

41:37.953 --> 41:41.957
And if anyone knocks,
pretend you're not here.

41:58.182 --> 42:00.726
You know Astrid's stuck in the Tail
because of you?

42:02.144 --> 42:03.687
They'll take good care of her.

42:05.523 --> 42:07.024
What are we gonna do about Melanie?

42:08.025 --> 42:09.693
I don't want to talk about Melanie.

42:10.903 --> 42:11.820
Okay.

42:15.241 --> 42:16.617
You pick a topic, then.

44:14.693 --> 44:15.736
Bring him in.

44:22.368 --> 44:23.243
Hey.

44:32.544 --> 44:33.837
Do you know what this is?

44:37.883 --> 44:38.884
A caliper.

44:41.095 --> 44:42.680
Every engineer needs one.

44:44.807 --> 44:47.101
Mr. Wilford gave me this.

44:47.935 --> 44:49.436
I want you to have it.

44:57.361 --> 45:00.864
There's something Mr. Wilford
needs from you, Miles.
