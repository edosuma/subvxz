WEBVTT

00:00.308 --> 00:02.937
Man, this summer kickoff
party's gonna be, like,

00:03.046 --> 00:05.615
mtv beach house
throwback status.

00:05.682 --> 00:07.884
Daisy Fuentes's butt-cheeks
are just gonna be flowing

00:07.951 --> 00:10.553
- in the wind.
- Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay!

00:10.621 --> 00:11.854
- That wasn't racist, was it?
- She had s--that's a good one.

00:11.922 --> 00:13.523
- It was a little.
- Okay, well.

00:13.590 --> 00:15.424
- It was a little racist.
- Hey, uh, dirk to blaze.

00:15.492 --> 00:17.860
Any sign of what's clogging
the drain, my main man?

00:17.928 --> 00:19.595
Negative, dude.

00:19.663 --> 00:21.697
I do see a barbeque
down here, though,

00:21.765 --> 00:24.934
and a suitcase
full of your clothes.

00:25.002 --> 00:27.503
I'm almost to the drain.
It's 2 meters.

00:27.571 --> 00:29.372
How's the air quality
down there?

00:29.439 --> 00:31.374
It's okay, it's all right.

00:31.441 --> 00:34.510
But I could use
a blow of the dro, sir.

00:34.578 --> 00:37.380
Blowing dro.

00:37.447 --> 00:39.882
He's blowing
dro now. Over.

00:39.950 --> 00:43.319
I just blew the dro.
Blew the dro.

00:43.387 --> 00:45.354
Hey, blaze, come on, man.

00:45.422 --> 00:47.123
Any sign of what's clogging
the drain?

00:47.190 --> 00:49.892
That's affirmative.
There's something...

00:49.960 --> 00:54.730
Oh, my God, guys!

00:54.798 --> 00:59.468
You're not gonna believe this.

01:03.674 --> 01:05.841
♪ I'm fresh

01:05.909 --> 01:07.510
♪ You gotta you gotta ♪

01:07.578 --> 01:11.480
- ♪ You gotta, gotta
- ♪ Gotta be fresh

01:11.548 --> 01:16.252
Gentledudes, before you lies
a fierce beast

01:16.320 --> 01:19.155
known to suck the brains
out of humans and goats,

01:19.222 --> 01:22.158
driven from their habitat
during the construction

01:22.225 --> 01:24.660
of the Rancho Garden Mall
in '98.

01:24.728 --> 01:26.862
Heck, the scientists
thought they moved up north.

01:26.930 --> 01:29.565
But I had
a different hypothesis.

01:29.633 --> 01:31.834
Looks like I was right.

01:31.902 --> 01:36.138
I give you...
The Rancho Chupacabraj.

01:36.206 --> 01:38.407
No, that is definitely
our neighbor mark's dog ambush.

01:38.475 --> 01:41.544
Covered in some of your hair
and possibly jizz.

01:41.612 --> 01:44.914
Not mine, though.

01:48.285 --> 01:50.086
It's a Chupacabraj.

01:50.153 --> 01:52.822
I can't believe you're
carrying around a dead animal.

01:52.889 --> 01:55.324
Well, I can't just leave
this priceless artifact at home.

01:55.392 --> 01:57.560
What happens if, like,
Nicolas cage rolls

01:57.628 --> 01:59.662
through the neighborhood and
steals this national treasure?

01:59.730 --> 02:01.998
Whatever. Let's stick
to the mission, stromies.

02:02.065 --> 02:03.232
- We need some, like, pool toys.
- Yes.

02:03.300 --> 02:04.533
Chicks are like cats, dude.

02:04.601 --> 02:06.268
If you don't keep
their attention,

02:06.336 --> 02:09.338
they'll wait for--on--
on top of the refrigerator.

02:09.406 --> 02:10.906
- Yep.
- Welcome, gentlemen,

02:10.973 --> 02:13.709
to Tez's summer
blowout special.

02:13.777 --> 02:17.079
I got everything you need.
Games for the Dreamcast,

02:17.147 --> 02:19.915
Playstation One,
and free smoovies.

02:19.983 --> 02:22.251
'Cause white folks
love smoovies.

02:22.319 --> 02:23.519
- Smoovies?
- That's what I said.

02:23.587 --> 02:25.988
- Smoovies.
- With a "v"?

02:26.056 --> 02:28.057
Smoothies!
Wait, what do y'all want?

02:28.125 --> 02:30.660
We're actually looking
for pool toys and whatnot

02:30.727 --> 02:32.261
- and what have you.
- Pool toys.

02:32.329 --> 02:34.997
Let me check my inven--
you know what?

02:35.065 --> 02:37.500
Can I interest you boys
in some straw cowboy hats?

02:37.567 --> 02:38.734
Oh, that's a great idea.

02:38.802 --> 02:40.369
Whenever chicks
wear straw cowboy hats,

02:40.437 --> 02:43.706
they turn into sex cattle, man.
And cowgirl butts...

02:43.774 --> 02:47.276
- Just get my thing hard.
- Mm-hmm.

02:47.344 --> 02:49.078
Could you just show us
to the pool supplies?

02:49.146 --> 02:50.446
All right,
it's or this way, and--

02:50.514 --> 02:53.082
Waymond, you touch it,
you bought it.

02:53.150 --> 02:56.352
Come on.

02:56.420 --> 02:58.788
He has the <i>Space Jam</i>
soundtrack.

02:58.855 --> 03:01.057
Whoa, dudes, check this out.

03:01.124 --> 03:04.193
Damn!

03:04.261 --> 03:05.895
- Aw, yeah.
- What?

03:05.962 --> 03:07.697
That's the hover beast
hovercraft.

03:07.764 --> 03:10.566
Colleen won that
in a Tropicana bikini contest.

03:10.634 --> 03:14.270
150 horsepower engine.
Four-blade warp drive prop.

03:14.337 --> 03:17.440
- And it's all yours for $500.
- Dude.

03:17.507 --> 03:19.942
If we get this thing, man,
it'll vault our party

03:20.010 --> 03:22.978
into the most awesomest maximus
event of the summer.

03:23.046 --> 03:24.647
- Ah, brain freeze.
- Montez Walker

03:24.715 --> 03:26.315
- on the invite list?
- Never.

03:26.383 --> 03:30.419
How about I give you $200?

03:30.487 --> 03:32.221
Y'all talk about that.

03:32.289 --> 03:34.090
No, no, no, no, no.
We can't spend that much money,

03:34.157 --> 03:35.925
because then we won't
have enough money

03:35.992 --> 03:38.260
for the cowboy hats, and if
we don't have cowboy hats,

03:38.328 --> 03:40.329
how am I gonna
save a horse, ride a cowgirl?

03:40.397 --> 03:42.231
If we have a hovercraft,
we don't need cowboy hats.

03:42.299 --> 03:44.133
- Yeah.
- Hovercrafts are aphrodisiacs.

03:44.201 --> 03:45.634
They're basically...
oysters of the ocean.

03:45.702 --> 03:47.369
Yummy.

03:47.437 --> 03:49.238
Yeah, I guess you're right.
Plus, you know what?

03:49.306 --> 03:52.608
We could charge people money
to ride on the hovercraft

03:52.676 --> 03:55.578
and also money to take pictures
with the Chupacabraj.

03:55.645 --> 03:57.546
At this point now,
we're making money.

03:57.614 --> 03:59.115
We're making money
off our party.

03:59.182 --> 04:02.284
Guys, we could just buy it
and return it next week.

04:02.352 --> 04:06.455
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
I heard that.

04:06.523 --> 04:08.758
No refunds around here.

04:08.825 --> 04:12.495
- All sales final.
- How did he hear that?

04:12.562 --> 04:15.498
$450, plus you throw in

04:15.565 --> 04:17.833
all the straw cowboy hats
we can eat, and that's a deal.

04:17.901 --> 04:21.637
And whatever's in arm's reach.

04:21.704 --> 04:24.140
- And this--this suit.
- Whoa, cool!

04:24.207 --> 04:25.407
- Sold!
- Okay!

04:25.475 --> 04:26.976
- Yes!
- But you be careful

04:27.043 --> 04:28.544
in that suit.
It's powerful.

04:28.612 --> 04:30.446
It makes women just....

04:30.514 --> 04:32.014
They just

04:32.082 --> 04:34.183
Waymond! Get over here
and get a sendoff picture

04:34.251 --> 04:36.185
- like we at the Saturn dealer.
- There we go.

04:36.253 --> 04:39.021
- All right.
- Charge that to the game.

04:39.089 --> 04:41.257
Cool.

04:41.324 --> 04:42.691
All right, Ders,
fire this puppy up.

04:42.759 --> 04:43.926
- Whoo!
- You got it!

04:43.994 --> 04:45.194
Here we go.

04:45.262 --> 04:47.663
- Land-ho!
- Ahoy!

04:49.266 --> 04:50.866
Oh, captain,
this is going down!

04:50.934 --> 04:52.301
I don't like
when your mom visits.

04:52.369 --> 04:53.702
She's always flirting with me.

04:53.770 --> 04:55.104
She's got those
big titties like you.

04:55.172 --> 04:58.541
- No sale!
- What in the [bleep] is going--

04:58.608 --> 05:01.010
We want our $450 back,

05:01.077 --> 05:02.444
because the hovercraft
you sold us

05:02.512 --> 05:04.313
catches fire way too easily.

05:04.381 --> 05:06.882
I told y'all no refunds.

05:06.950 --> 05:08.284
Ain't that right,
way-way?

05:08.351 --> 05:10.452
- He heard me.
- We don't want refunds.

05:10.520 --> 05:12.454
We want our money back
so we can buy a hovercraft

05:12.522 --> 05:13.689
that actually flies.

05:13.757 --> 05:14.957
- Mm-hmm.
- In the water.

05:15.025 --> 05:16.592
- Wat--water flight.
- Mm-hmm.

05:16.660 --> 05:18.460
Yeah, that's right.
Our pool party's ruined.

05:18.528 --> 05:20.162
Now it's just guys
with cowboy hats

05:20.230 --> 05:22.331
squirting each other.
That's bad.

05:22.399 --> 05:24.500
- And?
- Well...

05:24.568 --> 05:28.337
We'll sue you. We'll take
everything you've got.

05:28.405 --> 05:30.072
- That's a really good idea.
- Thanks.

05:30.140 --> 05:31.507
That's why he's the brains
of the operation.

05:31.575 --> 05:33.309
You want to get
judge Joe brown on it?

05:33.376 --> 05:35.077
You want some judge Judy
up your booty?

05:35.145 --> 05:36.612
You better lawyer up.

05:36.680 --> 05:38.981
- You better lawyer up.
- ♪ Lawyer up

05:39.049 --> 05:41.851
- ♪ You better lawyer up!
- There's no lawyers

05:41.918 --> 05:43.652
- in small claims court.
- What?

05:43.720 --> 05:46.088
- Then lawyer down, okay?
- Yeah, so lawyer down.

05:46.156 --> 05:48.357
You know what? We're gonna
see you in court, man.

05:48.425 --> 05:50.092
- See you there.
- No, we will.

05:50.160 --> 05:51.727
- We'll see you in court.
- Oh, well, bring it.

05:51.795 --> 05:52.995
Yeah, fine, we will bring it.

05:53.063 --> 05:54.430
- Fine, then.
- Mm.

05:54.497 --> 05:56.198
Yo, what the [bleep]
you did right there?

05:56.266 --> 05:57.666
That's my cactus!

05:57.734 --> 05:59.335
You want to go
in the [bleep] garbage can?

05:59.402 --> 06:00.870
- Sorry.
- Sorry, jet set.

06:00.937 --> 06:02.605
We thought it was his cactus.
We didn't know.

06:02.672 --> 06:04.406
Now y'all get out of my house.

06:04.474 --> 06:05.708
Have a good day.

06:05.775 --> 06:13.751
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

06:13.871 --> 06:15.105
Move it along, people.

06:15.172 --> 06:17.007
We got a big-time lawyer
coming through.

06:17.074 --> 06:18.441
Guys, I applied to law school.

06:18.509 --> 06:20.143
I didn't even
get accepted anywhere.

06:20.211 --> 06:22.579
Well, that's not true.
You got accepted in our hearts.

06:22.646 --> 06:25.615
No homo, pro bono.
That's a lawyer term, right?

06:25.683 --> 06:27.617
I'm gonna say it again.
I have no idea.

06:27.685 --> 06:29.352
I don't know.
I don't know.

06:29.420 --> 06:31.187
I don't understand
how you don't know,

06:31.255 --> 06:33.823
because you've seen every
episode of <i>Franklin & Bash.</i>

06:33.891 --> 06:35.325
- Who hasn't?
- That's true.

06:35.393 --> 06:36.760
That's a good show.
Really good show.

06:36.827 --> 06:39.829
Ders, you have a briefcase.
Use that.

06:39.897 --> 06:41.498
I do have a briefcase.

06:41.565 --> 06:44.267
We bought a hovercraft
for a party that we can't have.

06:44.335 --> 06:45.769
You know how sad that makes me?

06:45.836 --> 06:49.739
- Lawyer the sadness away.
- I will, man.

06:49.807 --> 06:53.109
- This your bag?
- Uh, yes, sir, it is.

06:53.177 --> 06:54.677
- That was salty.
- I'm gonna have to search it.

06:54.745 --> 06:57.247
Oh, uh, yeah, go ahead.

06:57.314 --> 06:59.516
- Sure, yeah, of course.
- Oh, damn!

06:59.583 --> 07:01.584
Yeah, pretty freaky, right?
It's a, uh--

07:01.652 --> 07:03.920
It's actually
a Rancho Chupacabraj.

07:03.988 --> 07:06.656
Uh, but I have to take it
with me. It's evidence in a...

07:06.724 --> 07:12.195
Uh...well, a--a dude having sex
with a Chupacabraj case, so...

07:12.263 --> 07:14.097
- Get out of here.
- All right.

07:14.165 --> 07:16.099
- Thanks, sir.
- He found it covered in jizz.

07:16.167 --> 07:18.935
We're not sure what--animal jizz
or human jizz, we're not sure.

07:23.574 --> 07:25.041
You've all been sworn in.

07:25.109 --> 07:26.776
Gentlemen, I've read
your complaint.

07:26.844 --> 07:29.345
Do you have anything to add
other than your claim

07:29.413 --> 07:30.980
of boat fraud
in the first degree,

07:31.048 --> 07:33.750
which I'd like to point out
is not real thing?

07:33.818 --> 07:35.685
Well, we're here to prove
that it is, your honor.

07:35.753 --> 07:38.421
If I may, I'm gonna stand.

07:38.489 --> 07:40.490
I'd like to, uh,
address the jury here.

07:40.558 --> 07:43.793
Uh, plaintiff, uh,
this isn't a jury trial.

07:43.861 --> 07:45.095
They're here
awaiting their cases.

07:45.162 --> 07:47.197
- These people?
- Uh-huh.

07:47.264 --> 07:49.199
Thank you, judge Tibbles.

07:49.266 --> 07:51.101
Ladies and gentlemen
of the esteemed court,

07:51.168 --> 07:54.037
two dudes with some
bodacious ponytails.

07:54.105 --> 07:56.773
- 22 inches and counting.
- Dude.

07:56.841 --> 07:58.808
This is 19 inches.
It's longer than yours.

07:58.876 --> 08:00.110
- No, it's not.
- I measured it

08:00.177 --> 08:01.544
- from the base up here.
- I measured it

08:01.612 --> 08:03.012
from the top of my forehead.

08:03.080 --> 08:06.816
I have but one word:

08:06.884 --> 08:10.286
"Justice."
Right?

08:10.354 --> 08:12.388
Just. Us.

08:12.456 --> 08:14.524
It's just us
on this planet earth.

08:14.592 --> 08:16.526
We're alone, so...

08:16.594 --> 08:18.795
We need to trust each other.

08:18.863 --> 08:22.365
Trust. Us.

08:22.433 --> 08:24.634
Rhymes, so you know
that it's real.

08:24.702 --> 08:28.338
Which brings me
to the question...

08:28.405 --> 08:31.007
Are we human...

08:31.075 --> 08:34.144
Or are we dancers?

08:34.211 --> 08:35.979
Plaintiff, is there any
additional evidence

08:36.046 --> 08:37.847
besides
the defective hovercraft?

08:37.914 --> 08:39.549
No, but look,
I was having a good time.

08:39.616 --> 08:41.717
The problem is that this guy
sold us a bunk hovercraft,

08:41.784 --> 08:43.486
and now we're gonna have
a sausage fest

08:43.554 --> 08:45.488
with no bikinis
and no straw cowboy hats,

08:45.556 --> 08:47.056
and I don't think
you're being fair.

08:47.124 --> 08:48.625
This isn't fair.

08:48.692 --> 08:51.161
Mr. Walker, how do you respond
to the accusation?

08:51.228 --> 08:55.665
Your honor, I know your time
is valuable, so I will be brief.

08:55.733 --> 08:58.701
Um, this here
is a textbook witch hunt--

08:58.769 --> 09:01.971
- How's he sound so real?
- That will clearly exonerate me

09:02.039 --> 09:05.475
from all these prejudicious
and unfair charges.

09:05.543 --> 09:07.110
This isn't a race thing, sir.

09:07.178 --> 09:08.778
- May I approach the bench?
- Proceed.

09:08.846 --> 09:10.547
- He knows exactly...
- You're dumb.

09:10.614 --> 09:13.716
Your honor, as you can see,
in nine separate locations,

09:13.784 --> 09:17.187
in accordance with
our great law, is my signs.

09:17.254 --> 09:19.689
Ders, why aren't you
using the briefcase?

09:19.757 --> 09:21.224
There's nothing
inside the briefcase

09:21.292 --> 09:23.560
except for golf pencils
and baseball cards,

09:23.627 --> 09:25.228
and slim Jim dare.

09:25.296 --> 09:27.063
Slim Jim dare really
freaking hot beef jerky,

09:27.131 --> 09:28.798
and you didn't
give us any of that.

09:28.866 --> 09:30.300
This is the jalapeno kind,
and you didn't give--

09:30.367 --> 09:31.968
- You didn't even think--
- Gentlemen, please.

09:32.036 --> 09:35.305
This is a court of law.
It's not a feeding trough.

09:35.372 --> 09:37.874
I had one.
I had--this one was out.

09:37.942 --> 09:40.376
- I just--okay.
- No, no, dude, dude, come on.

09:40.444 --> 09:41.878
I think you're making
a very good case here.

09:41.946 --> 09:43.913
Okay, Ders's lawyering
didn't work,

09:43.981 --> 09:47.150
so it's time for me
to do some liar-ing.

09:47.218 --> 09:50.019
- I'm gonna lie.
- Oh, cool.

09:50.087 --> 09:51.921
Your honor,

09:51.989 --> 09:56.025
I do declare
that we have a star witness

09:56.093 --> 09:59.662
that we would like
to call to the stand.

09:59.730 --> 10:03.533
- To the what?
- To the stand.

10:03.601 --> 10:04.767
I don't understand
the word you're saying.

10:04.835 --> 10:07.237
To the stand, to the stand.

10:07.304 --> 10:09.572
And we all were just
screaming, "Montez, stop,"

10:09.640 --> 10:12.775
and he just continued
to squeeze the life

10:12.843 --> 10:15.044
out of the poor little
girl scout's dalmatian.

10:15.112 --> 10:18.281
- It was--it was disgusting.
- What?

10:18.349 --> 10:20.516
- Can we get back to the case?
- Your honor.

10:20.584 --> 10:22.852
We are just here to tell
the truth, the whole truth,

10:22.920 --> 10:25.021
and nothing but the truth
about a vile

10:25.089 --> 10:28.524
and disgusting man who
was trying to ruin our party.

10:28.592 --> 10:30.693
Could you use
your regular voice, please?

10:30.761 --> 10:32.195
This young lady

10:32.263 --> 10:33.963
knows where I'm coming from,

10:34.031 --> 10:36.599
- don't you, doll?
- Huh?

10:36.667 --> 10:38.268
Do you like pool parties, miss?

10:38.335 --> 10:39.602
Yeah.

10:39.670 --> 10:41.704
And are you available
this Saturday,

10:41.772 --> 10:45.942
and may I remind you
you are under oath?

10:46.010 --> 10:49.045
I guess I don't have any plans.

10:49.113 --> 10:50.647
Can we get back
to the case please?

10:50.714 --> 10:52.315
Your honor,
I'm just making sure

10:52.383 --> 10:55.852
that everybody in here
is being truthful,

10:55.919 --> 11:00.323
such as myself holding on
to my nine-inch lap-hog,

11:00.391 --> 11:05.028
which must be a true thing
since I am also under oath.

11:05.095 --> 11:07.096
Uh, yeah, we all
have really big dongs.

11:07.164 --> 11:08.998
- I swear on a stack of bibles.
- My dick's big.

11:09.066 --> 11:12.268
I believe we've had enough
lap-hog talk for one lifetime.

11:12.336 --> 11:14.003
I'm sorry, your honor.
Did you guys see

11:14.071 --> 11:17.173
the "No refund" signs
at the garage sale, or no?

11:17.241 --> 11:18.708
I certainly
did not see a sign--

11:18.776 --> 11:21.844
- That is a lie!
- I should warn you gentlemen

11:21.912 --> 11:24.514
that perjury laws
are swift and severe.

11:24.581 --> 11:27.884
Mm-hmm, swift willy style,
all in there.

11:27.951 --> 11:29.619
You may sit down.

11:29.687 --> 11:31.521
Does the defense
have any response?

11:31.588 --> 11:34.457
Yes, I do.
I also have a star witness

11:34.525 --> 11:35.892
who can prove
beyond a reasonable doubt

11:35.959 --> 11:37.727
that these sucker-necks
are lying.

11:37.795 --> 11:41.731
Defense calls Waymond Womano.

11:41.799 --> 11:43.333
Oh, [bleep], this is bad.

11:43.400 --> 11:45.001
He saw everything.
We can't let him testify.

11:45.069 --> 11:46.703
If he testifies, we're gonna go
to jail for perjury.

11:46.770 --> 11:49.739
- You should've told me that.
- I thought you knew.

11:49.807 --> 11:52.308
I choose to accept
this mission.

11:52.376 --> 11:54.210
Uh...

11:58.649 --> 12:01.050
State your name
for the court record, please.

12:01.118 --> 12:02.985
What the heck's that?

12:05.689 --> 12:07.023
What the...

12:07.091 --> 12:08.257
What the hell?

12:08.325 --> 12:10.059
Court is adjourned
till tomorrow.

12:10.127 --> 12:11.994
Yeah.

12:12.062 --> 12:14.764
Adjourning's the best.
Obviously we're adjourning

12:14.832 --> 12:16.766
'cause you have rats
in your vents.

12:16.834 --> 12:18.067
That's the first smart thing
you done all day.

12:18.135 --> 12:19.502
You're at the courthouse.

12:19.570 --> 12:21.371
Y'all slick, you're real slick.

12:21.438 --> 12:22.939
I know y'all threw
that dookie bag.

12:23.006 --> 12:25.441
But we back tomorrow,
and Waymond is pissed.

12:25.509 --> 12:27.510
You messed up his church shoes,
and look at my good suit.

12:27.578 --> 12:29.078
How about we settle
out of court?

12:29.146 --> 12:30.580
You know, we'll take you
to Ruby Tuesday's,

12:30.647 --> 12:32.382
we'll buy you
a root-beer and a burger.

12:32.449 --> 12:34.484
The only thing y'all
gonna be eating is ass salad.

12:34.551 --> 12:37.720
Talking about prison
for in and around 30 days.

12:37.788 --> 12:39.255
Good luck.

12:39.323 --> 12:41.057
Oh, man, we're going to jail,

12:41.125 --> 12:44.060
and I never got to Eiffel Tower
a chick with one of you guys.

12:44.128 --> 12:45.628
We're not gonna go to jail
if Waymond doesn't testify.

12:45.696 --> 12:46.996
Oh, we're eating
ass salad, man.

12:47.064 --> 12:49.732
I'm gonna ha
a big bowl of ass salad.

12:49.800 --> 12:52.268
You heard Tez.
Waymond's snitching tomorrow.

12:52.336 --> 12:54.771
Not we get to him tonight.

12:56.000 --> 13:02.074

13:07.184 --> 13:08.718
Shut up, stay right there!

13:08.786 --> 13:10.987
- And drive!
- Whoops! Hey!

13:11.054 --> 13:13.022
Don't talk though.
Don't talk though.

13:18.348 --> 13:21.083
Waymond Womano,
we can't be responsible

13:21.151 --> 13:23.290
for what happens if you show up
in court tomorrow.

13:23.420 --> 13:27.790
But we can be very responsible
if you--

13:27.858 --> 13:29.826
if you don't...do that.

13:29.893 --> 13:33.029
Yeah, stick your hand
in this bag.

13:33.097 --> 13:36.933
Do it! You feel that?
Those are the eyeballs of kids

13:37.000 --> 13:38.601
that we plucked
out of their heads!

13:38.669 --> 13:40.803
And this?
This is intestines.

13:40.871 --> 13:42.371
No, Blake.
We're, uh--

13:42.439 --> 13:45.475
Dude #1, we told you
he's not blindfolded.

13:45.542 --> 13:48.377
He's not blindfolded.
He can see that it's spaghetti.

13:48.445 --> 13:52.949
Well, this is spaghetti
that a dude was eating,

13:53.016 --> 13:55.384
- but we killed him.
- Yeah!

13:55.452 --> 13:56.986
And we'll kill you too.

13:57.054 --> 13:59.789
- Yeah, we killed his ass.
- Are you ready to die?

13:59.857 --> 14:01.157
Oh, that's the game
you want to play?

14:01.225 --> 14:02.959
- Oh, okay.
- Dig your own grave, bud.

14:03.026 --> 14:04.594
Yeah, dig the fricking grave,

14:04.661 --> 14:07.130
you marshmallow-looking
mother.

14:10.501 --> 14:12.635
- What?
- Heh, heh...

14:12.703 --> 14:14.937
- Little help?
- Oh.

14:15.005 --> 14:16.339
- Just throw--hurry up.
- Yeah.

14:16.406 --> 14:18.174
- Go falcons!
- Thank you.

14:18.242 --> 14:20.243
Hey, nice arm.

14:20.310 --> 14:23.179
It's a shovel, not a broom.

14:23.247 --> 14:25.114
- Come on, jeez.
- That's what you got?

14:25.182 --> 14:27.950
Harder. He's throwing it
on his shoe--shoes.

14:28.018 --> 14:30.786
You really suck at this.
He sucks at this.

14:30.854 --> 14:32.655
Jesus Christ, you're horrible.

14:32.723 --> 14:34.090
I'm actually
not very good either.

14:34.158 --> 14:35.324
Well, you're holding
the spaghetti.

14:35.392 --> 14:37.260
We told you not
to bring the spaghetti.

14:37.327 --> 14:38.461
I'm gonna go
get some more shovels.

14:38.529 --> 14:39.962
Yeah.

14:40.030 --> 14:41.664
I'm actually really proud
of us, guys.

14:41.732 --> 14:43.099
This hole
is freaking impressive.

14:43.167 --> 14:45.601
- It's crazy.
- Whoa, dude, look,

14:45.669 --> 14:47.470
you're gonna kill yourself
if you don't start lifting

14:47.538 --> 14:49.105
with your body
instead of your arm muscles.

14:49.173 --> 14:51.107
Well, my arm muscles
are my body, Ders.

14:51.175 --> 14:53.075
In fact, I think
they're most of it.

14:53.143 --> 14:55.111
I think we can all agree
that the most important thing

14:55.179 --> 14:56.846
to do is come
from the top here.

14:56.914 --> 14:58.147
- Yeah.
- Because all the leverage

14:58.215 --> 14:59.415
when you're going--ow!

14:59.483 --> 15:00.483
- Aah!
- Wait, what happened?

15:00.551 --> 15:02.251
- I think...
- What happened?

15:02.319 --> 15:04.153
- Splinter.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

15:04.221 --> 15:06.189
That's painful, that's painful,
that's very painful.

15:06.256 --> 15:08.090
Waymond? Waymond?
Wait, Waymond!

15:08.158 --> 15:09.825
- Waymond!
- Waymond!

15:09.893 --> 15:13.796
Waymond, wait, wait!
Maybe we went too far!

15:13.864 --> 15:16.032
Uh, we were just trying
to scare you out of testifying.

15:16.099 --> 15:17.500
It's us, the bull[bleep] boys!

15:17.568 --> 15:19.769
Well, we shouldn't have
let him wait

15:19.836 --> 15:22.505
- in the car to get warm.
- Really boner move on our part.

15:22.573 --> 15:24.340
Yeah, now we're gonna
go to prison for perjury.

15:24.408 --> 15:26.142
- And liar-ing even.
- Oh, man.

15:26.210 --> 15:30.479
Hot dudes like us do not do well
in prison, guys.

15:30.547 --> 15:34.150
We are like three fresh meat
butt sticks just waiting

15:34.218 --> 15:37.587
- for a dry rub.
- Oh, God, Blake's right.

15:37.654 --> 15:39.922
His <i>American Idol</i> hairdo,
your norse-ness.

15:39.990 --> 15:43.459
My pecs, my hammies.
My gluts, man!

15:43.527 --> 15:45.261
They're just waiting
for a good dicking.

15:45.329 --> 15:47.196
- Oh, we're gonna get pounded.
- Maybe, like,

15:47.264 --> 15:48.831
over time, it, like--
it gets okay.

15:48.899 --> 15:50.833
It's just skin
after all, right?

15:50.901 --> 15:52.501
- What?
- I don't know.

15:52.569 --> 15:54.503
I'm just trying to be, like,
a "glass half full" guy.

15:54.571 --> 15:57.406
You're gonna have an ass
half full of prison [bleep].

15:57.474 --> 15:58.641
So what should we do right now?

15:58.709 --> 16:00.109
Should we go get hamburgers?

16:00.177 --> 16:02.111
Eat a bunch of hamburgers
right now and get fat?

16:02.179 --> 16:04.380
So the dudes won't want
to butt-fun us?

16:04.448 --> 16:05.948
- We'll get fat, we'll get ugly.
- We have to beat the pretty

16:06.016 --> 16:07.516
out of each other.

16:07.584 --> 16:09.652
All right, well,
how do we go about doing that?

16:09.720 --> 16:12.321
I don't know. What do you say,
we count to three,

16:12.389 --> 16:14.824
and all, like, just punch
each other, same time?

16:14.891 --> 16:16.325
- To the right?
- Yeah, to the right.

16:16.393 --> 16:18.066
I don't want
to call you guys bitches,

16:18.186 --> 16:20.957
but you guys are bitches.

16:21.077 --> 16:22.377
You're bitches.

16:22.497 --> 16:25.027
You guys wouldn't be able to
hurt me, my face is very hard.

16:25.147 --> 16:28.584
Growing up, all the bullies
were, like, "Holy [bleep], man.

16:28.651 --> 16:29.985
- Your face so hard."
- Right.

16:30.053 --> 16:31.291
"It hurts my hand
when I punch."

16:31.411 --> 16:33.153
I need something
much harder to hit it.

16:33.273 --> 16:36.791
- Whoa! Uh...
- Dude, whoa.

16:36.911 --> 16:38.627
- You want me to blast you?
- No, no, no.

16:38.672 --> 16:40.406
Let's just, uh,
we'll tell him we fought.

16:40.474 --> 16:41.640
- No, yeah, good--good call.
- You all right, man?

16:41.708 --> 16:42.908
Adam, Adam, you okay?

16:42.976 --> 16:44.343
- Adam.
- Sorry.

16:44.411 --> 16:47.313
Come on, okay, oh...

16:47.381 --> 16:48.681
Did I get you?
Did I get you good?

16:48.749 --> 16:50.116
- Did I get you good?
- Uh, no.

16:50.183 --> 16:52.651
But Ders got me a--
a cracked rib for sure.

16:52.719 --> 16:54.620
We fought, and, uh,
Blake curbed me.

16:54.688 --> 16:55.855
- Just destroyed my face.
- Yeah, twice.

16:55.922 --> 16:58.090
I can see that.
I can see that.

16:58.158 --> 16:59.592
You look bad, dude.
You look bad.

16:59.659 --> 17:01.193
- Okay, let's--
- You look bad, dude.

17:01.261 --> 17:02.828
- This way.
- This--yeah.

17:02.896 --> 17:04.738
- Let's go home.
- Whoo!

17:04.858 --> 17:06.851
Oh, great,
the sun's coming up soon.

17:06.971 --> 17:09.220
Guess we'll be walking
straight to the courthouse.

17:17.156 --> 17:19.057
Hey, guys, when the judge
reads our sentences,

17:19.125 --> 17:21.226
- just don't cry.
- Yeah, definitely.

17:21.292 --> 17:22.727
Band of brajs, we got this.

17:22.795 --> 17:24.304
Does it smell
like burnt tires in here?

17:24.579 --> 17:25.847
Smell, like, a little
like something's burning?

17:25.915 --> 17:27.315
- No.
- Nice of you

17:27.383 --> 17:29.317
- to join us, gentlemen.
- Sorry, your honor,

17:29.385 --> 17:32.487
but took a one-and-a-half
in my pants on the elevator.

17:32.555 --> 17:34.656
Yes, that, uh,
definitely happened,

17:34.724 --> 17:36.658
but we won't bother you
with our whole morning.

17:36.726 --> 17:38.360
- No, uh...
- That's why we're late,

17:38.428 --> 17:39.828
'cause I-I-I [bleep]
and pissed my pants--

17:39.896 --> 17:42.297
- Adam, don't.

17:42.365 --> 17:43.665
We're ready
to take responsibility

17:43.733 --> 17:46.301
for whatever Waymond
told you we did.

17:46.369 --> 17:48.804
Before Mr. Womano testifies,
I understand that he has

17:48.871 --> 17:52.240
some physical evidence that may
be pertinent to this case.

17:52.308 --> 17:54.376
I got pictures of y'all
in front of my signs.

17:54.444 --> 17:57.045
You gonna fry.
Some ass salad.

18:03.119 --> 18:07.756
I mean...

18:07.824 --> 18:11.526
Whoo, wow, I'm hairy.

18:11.594 --> 18:13.195
I fail to see the relevance
of any of this.

18:13.262 --> 18:15.697
Sir, my wife Colleen
is taking a photography class

18:15.765 --> 18:18.667
at the learning annex and
she needed a sexy model, so...

18:18.734 --> 18:20.102
Just move ahead
at your discretion.

18:20.169 --> 18:23.338
Oh, bam!
There it is!

18:23.406 --> 18:26.108
Well, would you look at that?
Seems like Mr. Walker's

18:26.175 --> 18:28.009
been telling the truth
the whole time.

18:28.077 --> 18:30.612
Oh, this one has a little
"play" icon in the corner.

18:30.680 --> 18:32.981
Shall I play it and see
what we can surmise from this?

18:35.685 --> 18:39.254
Did you see Monteezy
work his magic?

18:39.322 --> 18:41.389
I sold these fools
a broke-ass hovercraft.

18:41.457 --> 18:44.292
That's what they get for never
inviting me to their parties.

18:44.360 --> 18:46.895
Now let's go get
some tacos and free smoothies.

18:46.963 --> 18:48.363
You're killing me, Waymond!

18:48.431 --> 18:50.799
After reviewing the evidence,

18:50.867 --> 18:53.969
the court finds
in favor of the plaintiffs.

18:54.036 --> 18:56.471
The defendant is ordered
to pay repair costs

18:56.539 --> 18:58.039
in their entirety.

18:58.107 --> 19:00.275
Did you just see the video?

19:00.343 --> 19:02.477
You won, gentlemen.

19:02.545 --> 19:05.280
- What? Oh!
- We won?

19:05.348 --> 19:06.548
- Whoo!
- We did it!

19:06.616 --> 19:09.317
Whoo, we  won!
We won!

19:09.385 --> 19:12.554
Whoo, this party sucks!

19:12.622 --> 19:16.124
All right, a maniac,
I like it, very cool.

19:16.192 --> 19:19.127
Hey, don't be shy, dudes.
Come on up and take a picture

19:19.195 --> 19:22.731
with the picture
of the Rancho Chupacabraj.

19:22.798 --> 19:24.466
Come on, we got one picture
for $10,

19:24.534 --> 19:27.402
two pictures for $5, so....

19:27.470 --> 19:30.405
Just take two. Two.
It's a cheaper deal.

19:30.473 --> 19:32.841
Yo, blaze, any day now.

19:32.909 --> 19:34.476
- Oh, yeah.
- Hey, guys,

19:34.544 --> 19:36.278
I just want to, uh,
take this opportunity

19:36.345 --> 19:39.648
to say welcome to our premier
beach house party of the summer!

19:39.715 --> 19:42.284
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!

19:42.351 --> 19:44.019
Okay, you guys don't
seem amped, and I get that.

19:44.086 --> 19:46.254
It's about 98%
to 99% dudes here.

19:46.322 --> 19:48.290
- It's mostly dudes.
- Yeah.

19:48.357 --> 19:51.626
That's okay, though, 'cause
once this bitch gets soaring,

19:51.694 --> 19:53.662
- it's gonna be a chick stampede.
- That's right.

19:53.729 --> 19:55.430
Let's take off those straw
cowboy hats, though,

19:55.498 --> 19:56.831
'cause those
are for the chicks.

19:56.899 --> 19:58.333
- Hey, look!
- Oh! Oh!

19:58.401 --> 20:00.202
- Hey, come in!
- No, no.

20:00.269 --> 20:02.537
- Yeah, yeah, she's with me.
- Let's go, let's go.

20:02.605 --> 20:05.106
[Bleep] this.

20:15.751 --> 20:17.619
- Aah!
- Oh...

20:17.687 --> 20:19.287
That was not our fault.

20:19.355 --> 20:20.722
- Oh, fudge.
- That's not our fault.

20:20.790 --> 20:22.791
Oh, my God.
Are you--are you boys okay?

20:22.858 --> 20:24.826
Yeah, if you mean
almost getting decapitated

20:24.894 --> 20:28.129
by your sharp-ass fence,
then yeah. Ow! Ow!

20:28.197 --> 20:30.198
Why is your fence
so sharp, dude?

20:30.266 --> 20:33.635
Are you kidding? You just
drove a boat through my yard.

20:33.703 --> 20:35.670
Well, we'll just have to see
how that holds up

20:35.738 --> 20:37.572
-in small claims court.
- Whoo!

20:37.640 --> 20:42.010
Yeah, that's right.
You better lawyer down, sir.

20:42.078 --> 20:44.045
I am a lawyer.
And with this kind of damage,

20:44.113 --> 20:45.782
I'm gonna bring you
to big boy court.

20:46.107 --> 20:49.417
Well, then, [bleep], sir.

20:49.485 --> 20:51.319
Nice.
