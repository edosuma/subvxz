          What's wrong?

00:30.765 --> 00:32.197
         Nothing, I just,
      I still feel like this

00:32.198 --> 00:34.333
        is a lot of house
         for two people.

00:34.335 --> 00:37.469

      Okay, be right there.

03:08.389 --> 03:10.322

             Come on.

03:18.199 --> 03:19.731
       Is this one of these

          you're taking
        a pregnancy test?

04:12.586 --> 04:15.754

  No, I don't know who that is.

  -Yeah, rock hard, every time.

       to give you earlier.

         Next time after
   you're done, um, performing

05:30.764 --> 05:34.833
         you should raise
     Katie's hips in the air.

        That's what I did.
  That's how she was conceived,

05:37.638 --> 05:40.839
   'cause we raised my hips in
    the air and then that way

05:40.841 --> 05:43.809

      right into my uterus.

10:34.768 --> 10:36.701
            -Take it.
              -Okay.

10:36.703 --> 10:39.838
        -You use hop oil?
   -No, I did not use hop oil.

10:39.840 --> 10:43.642
      You're kid-- You need
    hop oil for an IPA, John.

10:43.644 --> 10:45.877
    No, it's against the laws,
      everybody knows that.

10:45.879 --> 10:47.946
            -Says who?
      -The Reinheitsgrebot!

10:47.948 --> 10:51.883
      Those are 500 year old
   German beer laws, who cares?

10:51.885 --> 10:54.386
          The laws state
      the proper techniques

10:54.388 --> 10:56.388
         and ingredients
        to ensure quality.

10:56.390 --> 10:58.957
    Unless it follows the law,
   it's technically not a beer.

10:58.959 --> 11:01.126
           Well, you're
       technically a dork.

11:01.128 --> 11:05.096
       I mean, I love you,
        but you're a dork.
      I'm not drinkin' that.

11:05.098 --> 11:07.098
     As a women, this is the
     one thing I'm supposed

11:07.100 --> 11:09.434
         to be able to do
        and I can't do it.

11:09.436 --> 11:11.736
       I mean, that need to
     nurture, to be a mother.

11:11.738 --> 11:13.972
   That is, that's something...
               God,

11:13.974 --> 11:15.940
       it's something I've
      wanted my entire live.

11:15.942 --> 11:17.842
        Have you thought
        about adoption?

11:17.844 --> 11:19.911
      Yeah, we're on a list,
           but I dunno,

11:19.913 --> 11:22.080
      it'll be years before
       there's an opening.

11:22.082 --> 11:24.716
   And plus, we're just, we're
    not ready to stop trying.

11:24.718 --> 11:27.118
         Have you seen a
        fertility doctor?

11:27.120 --> 11:30.021
         Those procedures
       seem so... invasive.

11:30.023 --> 11:32.724
      You're just afraid of
  getting a shot, you big baby.

11:32.726 --> 11:36.728
       No, that's, that's,
        that's very true.
               Ew.

11:36.730 --> 11:38.930
     So, go see a doctor and
     if it doesn't work out,

11:38.932 --> 11:41.433
  -I'll give you one of my kids.
            -Oh okay.

11:41.435 --> 11:43.768
        -She up for grabs?
            -Not her,

11:43.770 --> 11:46.037
       but I could get you
     a sweet deal on Dougie.

11:46.039 --> 11:48.473
         [kids yelling]

11:48.475 --> 11:51.943
     [Katie] Ooh, hard pass.

11:55.982 --> 11:58.049
         Whatcha doin'?

11:58.051 --> 11:59.984
         [John] Oh, just
     finishing up some work.
         What's goin' on?

11:59.986 --> 12:01.853
         I wanna go to a
        fertility doctor.

12:04.791 --> 12:06.157
            Oh, now?

12:06.159 --> 12:08.827
  -I think they might be closed.
              -Okay.

12:08.829 --> 12:10.795
     No, I've been doing some
   research and I really think

12:10.797 --> 12:13.198
        this is the answer
     we've been looking for.

12:13.200 --> 12:14.933
        Are you serious?

12:14.935 --> 12:16.101
    Yeah, I found this doctor

12:16.103 --> 12:18.069
        and he's supposed
         to be the best.

12:18.071 --> 12:20.739
          Well, does our
       insurance cover it?

12:20.741 --> 12:21.940
              Yeah.

12:21.942 --> 12:23.842
           -Is it safe?
              -Yeah.

12:23.844 --> 12:25.944
  I mean, look, I'm not thrilled
        about this either,

12:25.946 --> 12:27.278
         but we've gotta
         face the facts.

12:27.280 --> 12:29.347
      What we've been doing,
        it's not working.

12:30.817 --> 12:32.217
        Do you think we've
       been doing it wrong?

12:32.219 --> 12:34.953
      You know, we should
      try reverse cowgirl.

12:34.955 --> 12:37.222
    I think that might help us
  and solve all of our problems.

12:37.224 --> 12:39.224
       -I'm being serious.
           -I am, too.

12:39.226 --> 12:41.526
  -Don't you still want a baby?
      -Yes, of course I do.

12:41.528 --> 12:43.128
        Okay, then I think
     this is our last chance.

12:43.130 --> 12:45.964
        I'm gonna turn 35
     this year and my uterus

12:45.966 --> 12:48.533
        is gonna shut down
         like Chernobyl.

12:48.535 --> 12:50.068
          No, it's not.

12:50.070 --> 12:51.269
        We've been trying
         to get pregnant

12:51.271 --> 12:53.004
      since we got married.
             That's--

12:53.006 --> 12:54.272
        that's five years
    without so much as a blip.

12:54.274 --> 12:55.974
         What if there's
     something wrong with me?

12:55.976 --> 12:57.108
         There's nothing
         wrong with you.

12:57.110 --> 12:59.244
      You don't know that.

12:59.246 --> 13:01.846
         Come on, this is
     really important to me.

13:01.848 --> 13:03.314
   I need you to get on board.

13:05.519 --> 13:07.218
              Okay.

13:07.220 --> 13:09.888
           -All right.
      Make the appointment.
              -Okay.

13:09.890 --> 13:11.256
       We'll hear what the
       doctor has to say.

13:11.258 --> 13:13.792
      This amazing doctor.

13:13.794 --> 13:16.127
          And then if it
      doesn't work we really
   need to try reverse cowgirl.

13:16.129 --> 13:17.896
      Are you really hung up
     on this reverse cowgirl?

13:17.898 --> 13:20.031
         -I don't why you
       -I think it's great.

13:20.033 --> 13:22.867
       You're facing north,
        I'm facing north,

13:22.869 --> 13:24.269
but you're going in front of me.

13:24.271 --> 13:26.037
      [Katie] I don't wanna
        look at your feet.

13:26.039 --> 13:27.572
         -[John] Look up.
    -[Katie] I can't look up,

13:27.574 --> 13:29.841
I'll lose my focus and I could--
       I could hurt you.

13:32.145 --> 13:33.878
          As you're both
         very much aware,

13:33.880 --> 13:35.280
         there are limits
      to manual conception.

13:35.282 --> 13:38.283
     Nature is a capricious,
           often times,

13:38.285 --> 13:40.218
        perplexing force
        that can benefit

13:40.220 --> 13:42.287
      from the helping hand
        of modern science.

13:42.289 --> 13:44.189
         But before I get
       into any specifics,

13:44.191 --> 13:46.124
   I wanna ask you a question.

13:46.126 --> 13:48.927
      It's a question I ask
    all my potential patients.

13:48.929 --> 13:52.197
   Are you both prepared to do
  what it takes to have a baby.

13:52.199 --> 13:55.066
             -Yeah.
             -Mm hm.

13:55.068 --> 13:57.101
           [chuckling]

13:57.103 --> 13:58.369
    Let me tell you a story.

13:58.371 --> 14:00.605
 On his famed March to the Sea,

14:00.607 --> 14:02.974
General William Tecumseh Sherman

14:02.976 --> 14:05.577
    presented an ultimatum to
    the citizens of Savannah.

14:05.579 --> 14:08.880
  Should I be forced to resort
  to assault, he warned them,

14:08.882 --> 14:10.582
        I shall then feel
      justified in resorting

14:10.584 --> 14:12.884
  to the harshest of measures,
  and shall make little effort

14:12.886 --> 14:15.119
      to restrain my army,
      now burning to avenge

14:15.121 --> 14:17.589
        the national wrong
     of dragging our country
         into civil war.

14:17.591 --> 14:19.324
So I'm gonna ask you both again.

14:19.326 --> 14:22.927
      Are you prepared to do
  what it takes to have a baby?

14:22.929 --> 14:25.864
              -Yes.
            -Yes, yes.

14:25.866 --> 14:28.132
             Great.

14:28.134 --> 14:30.301
       Katie, let's talk
       about your uterus.

14:31.204 --> 14:32.937
              Sure.

14:32.939 --> 14:35.106
      My 40 plus years of
      practicing medicine,

14:35.108 --> 14:38.076
      I've seen a wide range
       of uteri and yours,

14:38.078 --> 14:41.346
       is one of the finest
    specimens I've ever seen.

14:42.949 --> 14:44.382
             Really?

14:44.384 --> 14:47.118
    -It's a real showstopper.
            -Oh, okay.

14:47.120 --> 14:49.153
      -I think I'm blushing.
          -I knew that,

14:49.155 --> 14:51.956
     I always told her that.

14:51.958 --> 14:55.126
         So, if it's such
          a showstopper,

14:55.128 --> 14:57.095
 then why can't I get pregnant?

14:57.097 --> 14:58.663
      Well, I think we have
     to be open to the option

14:58.665 --> 15:01.099
        it may not be you
    that's having the problem.

15:01.101 --> 15:04.235
     John, when did you last
     have a sperm analysis?

15:04.237 --> 15:06.204
        I'm sorry, what?

15:06.206 --> 15:08.239
         You can not use
     any lubrication and all

15:08.241 --> 15:10.508
     the specimen must make
     it into the receptacle.

15:13.346 --> 15:15.179
      Wait a minute, I have
     to masturbate into this?

15:15.181 --> 15:17.015
         You bet you do.

15:17.017 --> 15:19.684
      If any of the specimen
   is not into the receptacle,

15:19.686 --> 15:22.020
    you will have to produce
another, but with others waiting

15:22.022 --> 15:24.122
      you'd have to go to
      the end of the line.

15:24.124 --> 15:26.257
  There's visual aids in there,
     I picked 'em out myself.

15:26.259 --> 15:28.393
      They're pretty good.

15:28.395 --> 15:30.495
         Titty Bonanza.

15:32.032 --> 15:33.364
              Gym.

15:33.366 --> 15:35.033
      What's the other one?

15:35.035 --> 15:37.402
      Oh, one's called Dad.

15:40.173 --> 15:44.676
   -When you're done, bring the
  specimen to the nurse's desk.
 -[softly] Come here, come here,

15:44.678 --> 15:46.711
      -come here, come here.
       -[Katie] What, what,
        what, what, what?

15:46.713 --> 15:48.346
     I have to jack off into
      this and I don't know

15:48.348 --> 15:50.114
     if I can do it, I don't
     know if I can perform.

15:50.116 --> 15:51.449
    What do you mean perform,
        it's not karaoke.

15:51.451 --> 15:53.151
       It's like Tupperware
         where you store

15:53.153 --> 15:54.419
       like mashed potatoes
          or something.

15:54.421 --> 15:56.688
        -I can't do this.
       -Of course you can.

15:56.690 --> 15:58.022
      -I'm not feelin' it
      -I don't understand
      why you can't do it.

15:58.024 --> 15:59.691
    [John] I don't feel sexy.

15:59.693 --> 16:01.292
   You don't feel-- I'm sorry,
       you don't feel sexy?

16:01.294 --> 16:02.727
      Just look at all guys
       sitting over there.

16:02.729 --> 16:04.295
       You're not gonna be
         with these guys.

16:04.297 --> 16:06.097
             -I know.
         -You're going in
        a different room,

16:06.099 --> 16:07.332
   -they're not gonna be there.
       -I just don't know.

16:07.334 --> 16:08.466
           It's there,
      it's a large opening.

16:08.468 --> 16:09.367
       -Is there a problem?
               -Hm?

16:09.369 --> 16:11.035
         No, no, no, no.

16:11.037 --> 16:12.337
    He's just having a little,
            [chuckles]

16:12.339 --> 16:14.272
         a little case of
      the old stage fright.

16:14.274 --> 16:16.107
              So...

16:16.109 --> 16:18.176
        If it helps, we do
      allow wives to assist.

16:18.178 --> 16:20.511
               Oh.

16:20.513 --> 16:22.447
               Oh.

16:22.449 --> 16:24.182
        [latch clicking]

16:24.184 --> 16:26.017
        [John] All right,
  let's just get this over with

16:26.019 --> 16:27.385
      -as soon as possible.
        -Oh, I don't know.

16:27.387 --> 16:30.455
       This is like the set
         of a Saw movie.

16:30.457 --> 16:33.257
             Oh, oh.

16:35.528 --> 16:38.196
          -Yeah, Dad.
          -It's there.

16:38.198 --> 16:41.399
   -It really is a video called
      -Dad. Oh, here we go,
           let's just.

16:41.401 --> 16:43.368
         Okay, all right,
    what do you need from me?

16:43.370 --> 16:45.136
      You want me to take my
    shirt off or my pants or?

16:45.138 --> 16:47.271
       -Give me a hand job.
        -Okay, copy that.

16:47.273 --> 16:50.341
           -Whoa, wait.
    -I'm sorry, they're cold.

16:50.343 --> 16:53.011
            -Blow in.
     -Oh yeah, Mr. Miyagi it.

16:53.013 --> 16:56.347
        Okay, just make a
       fire really quickly.

16:56.349 --> 16:58.216
            Camping.

16:58.218 --> 17:01.386
              -Okay.
            -Oh, yeah.

17:07.093 --> 17:09.160
        Can you not look
        at me like that.

17:09.162 --> 17:12.230
           -Like what?
         -You look like,
      like a Christmas elf.

17:12.232 --> 17:14.499
   Like, giving me a hand job,
   it's just a little awkward.

17:14.501 --> 17:15.800
           Okay, okay.

17:15.801 --> 17:17.234
         -[phone ringing]
           -All right.

17:17.237 --> 17:19.103
         Oh, I'm sorry.
         I know, I know.

17:19.105 --> 17:21.105
   -You have to be kidding me.
         -No, it's work.

17:21.107 --> 17:22.773
      I am supposed to be in
       a meeting right now.

17:22.776 --> 17:24.208
     -Let me just ignore it.
     -You are in a meeting.

17:24.210 --> 17:26.077
 It's a very important meeting.

17:26.079 --> 17:28.279
      Okay, well, I'm sorry.
   What can I do to make it...

17:28.281 --> 17:30.314
        -Talk dirty to me.
         -Talking dirty.

17:30.316 --> 17:32.183
      -Say somethin' nasty.
  -Dirty talking' comin' at ya.

17:32.185 --> 17:34.419
           Here we go.
 You are doin' such a great job.

17:34.421 --> 17:36.554
       I am so proud of you
        and you are just--

17:36.556 --> 17:38.322
      I'm, you're such a--
      you're a good person.

17:38.324 --> 17:40.058
        -Thank you, honey.
             -A plus.

17:40.060 --> 17:41.459
       Thank you for all
       the encouragement,

17:41.461 --> 17:42.493
  -but I'm not building a deck.
          -Is that good?

17:42.495 --> 17:43.795
     Okay, I see how it is.

17:43.797 --> 17:45.263
    Now say something dirty.

17:45.265 --> 17:46.597
         Something nasty.
        Call me something.

17:46.599 --> 17:48.533
   -Yes, uh, I think I got it.
           -Turn me on.

17:48.535 --> 17:50.401
          [Irish accent]
     You are a mighty steed.

17:50.403 --> 17:53.071
      Oh, you got the dirty
     leprechaun thing, okay.

17:53.073 --> 17:56.340
     Yes, and I am a fertile
   mare and I'm just galloping

17:56.342 --> 17:59.510
    through a wind blown field
       and you're comin' up

17:59.512 --> 18:01.412
   after me and ya mount me...

18:01.414 --> 18:03.448
          -Weird, but...
    -...and ya get behind me.

18:03.450 --> 18:05.817
      -And you stick it in.
        -Oddly effective.

18:05.819 --> 18:07.351
   -Is that good or is it bad?
        -I kinda liked it.

18:07.353 --> 18:08.586
        -Yeah, it's good.
   -Okay, we're going tighter.

18:08.588 --> 18:10.221
  -We're going a little tighter.
               -Oh.

18:10.223 --> 18:12.256
    -Okay, we good, we got it.
             -Oh, oh.

18:12.258 --> 18:13.558
        -You're the stead.
               -Oh.

18:13.560 --> 18:15.293
        -Plant your seed.
             -Oh, oh.

18:15.295 --> 18:17.261
    Nasty little leprechaun.

18:17.263 --> 18:19.630
 -I'm comin' for my pot of gold.
         -[John moaning]

18:19.632 --> 18:22.100
    Get it in the Tupperware.

18:44.190 --> 18:46.457
   Oh, hey, Danica, could I get
    your help with something?

18:46.459 --> 18:48.326
     Uh, yes, very quickly,
     I'm late for a meeting.

18:48.328 --> 18:50.228
      Okay, I'm just new to
    this accounting software,

18:50.230 --> 18:51.462
     -so I was just wondering
        -What do you need?

18:51.464 --> 18:53.164
          -Our payables.
            -Oh yeah,

18:53.166 --> 18:55.500
        if you just search
         by invoice date,

18:55.502 --> 18:57.468
 then you can just tab through.

18:57.470 --> 18:59.337
  -Oh, okay, yeah, that is easy.
           -It's easy.

18:59.339 --> 19:00.638
             Great.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.640
   Ah, sorry, one more thing.

19:02.642 --> 19:05.409
    Do we always wait 30 days
       to pay our invoices?

19:05.411 --> 19:07.578
          -Yes, always.
 -Huh, whose dumb idea was that?

19:07.580 --> 19:10.481
           -[stutters]
            -Uh, mine.
      We wanna show as much

19:10.483 --> 19:12.316
        cash on the books
           as possible.

19:12.318 --> 19:13.684
    Yes, it's just that, um,

19:13.686 --> 19:14.652
       the vendors give us
          a 2% discount

19:14.654 --> 19:16.621
      if we pay in 10 days.

19:16.623 --> 19:19.157
   I mean, that's like lending
       money at 36% a year.

19:19.159 --> 19:20.458
    No, that can't be right.

19:20.460 --> 19:22.627
           Well, yeah,
      it's 36.7 to be exact,

19:22.629 --> 19:24.529
         but what are our
       210 Net 30 payables?

19:24.531 --> 19:26.364
     -For which time period?
           -This month.

19:26.366 --> 19:28.366
          Company wide,
        about 4.6 million.

19:28.368 --> 19:31.302
       So, if we actually
       paid 20 days early,

19:31.304 --> 19:34.238
     then we would be saving
   $92,000 a month, which would

19:34.240 --> 19:38.409
   then turn out to roughly,
   like, $1.1 million a year.

19:38.411 --> 19:40.678
     -You're new here, right?
        -I am first week.

19:40.680 --> 19:43.381
           Great, well,
  I appreciate your enthusiasm,

19:43.383 --> 19:45.349
       but let's not try to
    reinvent the wheel, okay?

19:45.351 --> 19:47.285
        Yeah, copy that.

19:47.287 --> 19:49.253
         You're the CFO,
     I'm just the controller.

19:49.255 --> 19:50.655
       [Danica] Sounds like
   we're on the same page then.

19:50.657 --> 19:52.623
          That's great.

19:54.494 --> 19:56.761
     I'm smarter than she is.
           That's fine.

20:04.304 --> 20:06.704
      Dude, dude, where have
   you been, I've been lookin'
       for you all morning.

20:06.706 --> 20:09.273
         I know, I know.
       The code blew up the
    entire system in testing,

20:09.275 --> 20:11.542
      -but I'm gonna fix it
   -No, no, no, that's not it.

20:11.544 --> 20:13.544
     They sold the company.

20:13.546 --> 20:14.512
        What? Who? When?

20:14.514 --> 20:15.713
        Over the weekend.

20:15.715 --> 20:17.715
       And that's not all.

20:18.585 --> 20:19.750
       I got a promotion.

20:19.752 --> 20:22.286
              -Yeah.
       -Wow, that's great.

20:22.288 --> 20:26.257
      But, uh, they let the
     entire IT department go.

20:26.259 --> 20:27.825
              What?

20:29.462 --> 20:30.761
     That's your department.

20:30.763 --> 20:32.563
     -Yeah, I know dickhead.
            -Oh, okay.

20:32.565 --> 20:36.434
    So, anyway, you're fired,
     but that's not my call.

20:36.436 --> 20:38.236
        It's not my call.

20:40.373 --> 20:41.739
       You quit your job?

20:41.741 --> 20:43.774
       Oh, no, no, no, no,
           even better.

20:43.776 --> 20:45.576
          I got fired.

20:45.578 --> 20:47.612
   Ah, and what about Gordon?

20:47.614 --> 20:49.380
   They made him VP of sales.

20:49.382 --> 20:50.748
        Katie, do you see
      how wonderful this is?

20:50.750 --> 20:52.483
           They gave me
       a severance package.

20:52.485 --> 20:54.452
        That combined with
      what I've been saving,

20:54.454 --> 20:56.420
     I can focus all of my
     energy on the brewery.

20:56.422 --> 21:00.791
       [stutters] I'm very,
     I'm very happy for you.

21:02.528 --> 21:04.629
        What, what is it?
          What's wrong?

21:04.631 --> 21:07.465
     I'm not, I don't, okay,
      I don't wanna be like

21:07.467 --> 21:10.334
       a wet blanket here,
  but we are barely making ends
      meet with two incomes.

21:10.336 --> 21:13.671
        I mean, we've got
       credit card debt and
    mortgage and car payments.

21:13.673 --> 21:16.741
  I'm not saying that you can't
        open the brewery,

21:16.743 --> 21:18.743
         -but, I mean...
              -But?

21:18.745 --> 21:20.745
     We need another income.

21:20.747 --> 21:23.681
       Oh, Katie, I cannot
       get another IT job.

21:23.683 --> 21:27.518
     I mean, this brewery is
     gonna take all my time.
      It's a full time gig.

21:27.520 --> 21:31.455
  Okay, I'm not even saying you
  need to get like a job, job.

21:31.457 --> 21:33.557
  But just something part time,

21:33.559 --> 21:35.526
      something to keep our
        heads above water.

21:35.528 --> 21:37.495
           Like what?

21:40.066 --> 21:42.700
             Honda?

21:42.702 --> 21:44.702
         You my driver?

21:44.704 --> 21:47.371
        Yeah, that's me,
        I'm your driver.

21:47.373 --> 21:48.773
             Sweet.

21:48.775 --> 21:50.641
    Didn't think it was gonna
    be a piece of shit Honda.

21:50.643 --> 21:52.843
          I apologize.

21:52.845 --> 21:56.847
         All right, dude,
   flip a bitch, hop on the 10,

21:56.849 --> 21:59.817
 get off on Lincoln, I'll give
 ya a holler when we get there.

21:59.819 --> 22:02.753
 -All right, what's the address?
        -I wanna go home.

22:02.755 --> 22:05.389
 -What? You don't wanna go home.
      -No, I wanna go home.

22:05.391 --> 22:07.325
   -What are you talkin' about?
       -What's her address?

22:07.327 --> 22:09.527
      -She wants to go home.
       What's her address?
              -What?

22:09.529 --> 22:11.462
           Don't worry,
     it's my girlfriend, bro,
   she does this all the time.

22:11.464 --> 22:13.597
    You're comin' to my house.
     We're goin' to my house.

22:13.599 --> 22:15.633
          Get on the 10,
     what did I-- hey, whoa.

22:15.635 --> 22:17.101
   She's your girlfriend, huh?

22:17.103 --> 22:19.470
   [man] Yeah, my girlfriend.

22:19.472 --> 22:20.805
   Yeah, what's her last name?

22:23.810 --> 22:26.677
            All right,
     I'm gonna take her home.
       You get outa my car.

22:26.679 --> 22:28.412
         I'm not gettin'
      outta your car, dude.

22:28.414 --> 22:30.381
         Step on the gas.
             Hang on.

22:30.383 --> 22:31.682
          Come on, dude,
      we're gonna have a...

22:31.684 --> 22:33.684
     God, here we go again.

22:33.686 --> 22:36.387
   -Listen, who pays the bills?
            -Get out.

22:36.389 --> 22:37.755
           -I pay them.
        -Get outta my car.

22:37.757 --> 22:39.423
   Now he's getting mad at me.

22:39.425 --> 22:40.558
       We're still goin'
       to Tera and Bucks.

22:40.560 --> 22:42.626
     Just give me a second.

22:44.097 --> 22:46.430
               -Oh!
           -[chuckling]

22:46.432 --> 22:47.765
         Let's go, bro.

22:47.767 --> 22:50.434
         I'll whoop your
        fuckin' ass, dude.

22:50.436 --> 22:51.669
      You think you're big.

22:51.671 --> 22:53.637
   Let's go, big man, come on.

23:10.556 --> 23:13.124
         Hello. [laughs]

23:13.126 --> 23:14.658
           All right.

23:14.660 --> 23:16.861
          Oh, big day.

23:16.863 --> 23:19.797
            [humming]

23:19.799 --> 23:25.836
       Don't mind if I do.
              Twice.

23:25.838 --> 23:27.538
   Katie, what are you doing?

23:27.540 --> 23:30.174
  Just getting a little snack.

23:30.176 --> 23:32.710
  Sorry, maybe nobody told you.

23:32.712 --> 23:34.812
This is the Working Moms lunch.

23:34.814 --> 23:37.481
        We meet the first
    Wednesday of every month.

23:37.483 --> 23:39.750
    Oh, that's... exclusive.

23:39.752 --> 23:41.552
               -Hi.
            -Hi there.

23:41.554 --> 23:43.154
      Do you have children?

23:43.156 --> 23:44.622
         How's that now?

23:44.624 --> 23:46.857
           This is the
       Working Moms lunch.

23:46.859 --> 23:48.559
      Do you have a child?

23:48.561 --> 23:50.494
      [stammers] I... yes.

23:50.496 --> 23:52.963
           -So blessed.
        -Oh, a girl, boy?

23:54.567 --> 23:55.900
              Boy.

23:55.902 --> 23:57.701
       Oh, how old is he?

23:57.703 --> 23:59.470
             Three.

23:59.472 --> 24:01.005
        What's his name?

24:02.442 --> 24:03.941
         Plate... Plato,

24:03.943 --> 24:07.445
    like the old philosopher.

24:07.447 --> 24:10.648
 You don't have a child do you?

24:10.650 --> 24:12.850
            Or do I?

24:13.619 --> 24:14.852
            I don't.

24:14.854 --> 24:16.587
       -I do not, I do not.
           -Well, then,

24:16.589 --> 24:18.689
          maybe you just
      wanna leave us to it.

24:18.691 --> 24:20.891
      Yeah, I'll leave you
      workin' moms to it.

24:20.893 --> 24:23.561
          Good for you.
     Working. Being mothers.

24:23.563 --> 24:24.862
       Look at that, huh.

24:24.864 --> 24:26.597
     -Well, screw you, 1950s.
         -Thanks, Katie.

24:26.599 --> 24:27.731
              -Okay.
           -Thank you.

24:28.835 --> 24:30.501
         Hey, Rich, Pam.

24:30.503 --> 24:31.635
         -Hey, hey, hey.
        -What's happening?

24:31.637 --> 24:33.571
     [Rich] Good to see ya.

24:33.573 --> 24:35.673
          -Who are they?
   -Oh, you wouldn't know 'em.

24:35.675 --> 24:36.807
    Some of my bike friends.

24:36.809 --> 24:38.542
 Oh, they're your bike friends?

24:38.544 --> 24:40.211
         [Gordon] Yeah.

24:40.213 --> 24:41.946
  So what's this important news
        you gotta tell me?

24:41.948 --> 24:43.948
            Mm. Okay.

24:43.950 --> 24:47.651
  I'm gonna quit job, I'm gonna
    help you open the brewery.

24:47.653 --> 24:48.686
   I'm gonna be your partner.

24:48.688 --> 24:51.655
               -No.
            -Why not?

24:51.657 --> 24:53.824
       'Cause you do this
       every single time.

24:53.826 --> 24:55.860
        Every time I start
          something new,

24:55.862 --> 24:57.962
         -you come in and
        stomp all over it.
         -Name one time.

24:57.964 --> 25:00.698
        Uh, my landscaping
       business in college.

25:00.700 --> 25:01.966
         Genghis Lawns?

25:01.968 --> 25:03.834
          Come on, your
       overhead was insane.

25:03.836 --> 25:05.870
       No, look, I've got
       it all figured out.

25:05.872 --> 25:07.872
   You're gonna brew the beer,
   I'm gonna run the business.

25:07.874 --> 25:09.840
   -We'll make a million bucks.
               -No.

25:09.842 --> 25:11.842
      Look, I've got money.
          Okay, with me,

25:11.844 --> 25:13.277
           we can be up
    and running in two months.

25:13.279 --> 25:14.578
        Oh yeah, you have
        that kinda money?

25:14.580 --> 25:16.614
     Yeah, my 401K. My IRA,

25:16.616 --> 25:18.015
    -I can sell company stock.
   -What are you talking about?

25:18.017 --> 25:19.950
    You don't wanna sell that,
       that's blood money.

25:19.952 --> 25:22.019
      You just got promoted,
   why would you wanna do this?

25:22.021 --> 25:23.654
   I don't wanna sell software

25:23.656 --> 25:25.589
     for the rest of my life,
         John, all right?

25:25.591 --> 25:27.892
   I don't wanna look back and
   think I never took a risk.

25:27.894 --> 25:29.593
    I mean, this is important.
           What is it?

25:29.595 --> 25:31.595
    -I think I know that guy.
              -Who?

25:31.597 --> 25:34.298
       -Is that Dr. Remis?
        -Who's Dr. Remis?

25:34.300 --> 25:36.267
        Hey, John Kelly,
        good to see ya.

25:36.269 --> 25:38.002
    Hey, Doctor, how are ya?

25:38.004 --> 25:39.870
   This is my brother, Gordon.

25:39.872 --> 25:42.773
     General, that's quite an
  outfit you got on, I like it.

25:42.775 --> 25:45.009
   Oh, I teach American History
 at the local community college.

25:45.011 --> 25:46.944
       Today we're studying
     the Battle of the Bulge.

25:46.946 --> 25:49.280
      Germany's last feudal
  offense on the western front.

25:49.282 --> 25:51.782
       -My favorite battle.
       -Well, you probably
        have to get back.

25:51.784 --> 25:53.784
         -Good to see ya.
        -No, no, I'm glad
         I ran into you.

25:53.786 --> 25:55.786
   We just got the results back
    from your semen analysis.

25:55.788 --> 25:58.822
               -Oh.
            -No, doc.
  Can we talk about this later?

25:58.824 --> 26:00.324
         No, no, it's not
       all bad news though,

26:00.326 --> 26:01.859
         even though your
       sperm count is low.

26:01.861 --> 26:04.061
              -Low.
         -Please not now.

26:04.063 --> 26:06.030
    Let me ask you something.
      What kinda underslacks
           do you wear?

26:06.032 --> 26:07.865
        Boxers or briefs?

26:12.004 --> 26:13.771
     Briefs, I wear briefs.

26:13.773 --> 26:15.039
          -There you go.
           -Oh, briefs.

26:15.041 --> 26:16.974
     You're wearing Underoos,
           little bro?

26:16.976 --> 26:19.677
     Come on, everyone knows
     you gotta wear boxers.

26:19.679 --> 26:21.579
     He's right, in order to
   produce a sufficient amount

26:21.581 --> 26:23.681
    of sperm, the temperature
         of the testicles

26:23.683 --> 26:24.949
     needs to be lower than
     the body temperature.

26:24.951 --> 26:27.318
         The briefs keep
       the testicles warm.

26:27.320 --> 26:29.119
    You gotta cool those off.
 Then what's the good news, doc,

26:29.121 --> 26:30.854
        you said there was
         some good news.

26:30.856 --> 26:32.656
         Even though his
       sperm count is low,

26:32.658 --> 26:34.024
     the sperm he does have
     are excellent swimmers.

26:34.026 --> 26:35.059
     So there's nothing to
     be ashamed of, mister.

26:35.061 --> 26:36.860
        I beg to differ.

26:36.862 --> 26:38.629
      Anyways, I gotta run.
         Give me a call,

26:38.631 --> 26:40.598
           we'll decide
     what our next steps are.

26:40.600 --> 26:42.733
   -Gordon, nice to meet you.
   -Nice to meet you, Doctor.

26:43.669 --> 26:45.069
           I like him.

26:45.071 --> 26:46.971
Wonder what kinda bike he rides.

26:46.973 --> 26:49.873
       -[Dr. Remis] Ducati.
             -Oh man,

26:49.875 --> 26:52.743
        Ducati, that's an
 Italian bike, I know that much.

26:52.745 --> 26:55.079
       Hey, here's to some
      strong swimmers, huh?

26:55.081 --> 26:58.349
 [Dr. Remis] Okay, there are two
    ways that we can go here.

26:58.351 --> 27:01.118
           The first is
      ovulation stimulation

27:01.120 --> 27:03.821
    through medical regiment
    of injectable hormones.

27:03.823 --> 27:06.056
              -Oh.
              -Hmm.

27:06.058 --> 27:07.891
   Katie's afraid of needles.

27:07.893 --> 27:09.960
       She has tattoos, but
     she's scared of needles.

27:09.962 --> 27:11.829
         It's different.
        It's so different.

27:11.831 --> 27:13.697
       One is like this and
     the other is like this.

27:13.699 --> 27:15.833
         -It's different.
    -At the time of ovulation

27:15.835 --> 27:18.802
    -we would perform an IUI.
          -What is that,
          what's an IUI?

27:18.804 --> 27:20.004
  It's when they take the sperm

27:20.006 --> 27:22.072
         and they implant
       it into the uterus.

27:22.074 --> 27:23.774
               -Oh.
        -Exactly, and the
       health of the sperm

27:23.776 --> 27:25.776
        and the ovaries is
    essential to the process.

27:25.778 --> 27:27.711
      So I have to recommend
    you abstain from alcohol,

27:27.713 --> 27:29.380
tobacco and recreational drugs.

27:29.382 --> 27:31.015
        But that's just a
  recommendation though, right?

27:31.017 --> 27:33.017
    You also have to refrain
    from manual intercourse.

27:33.019 --> 27:35.719
       That's not just a
recommendation, that's an order.

27:35.721 --> 27:38.856
    I'm sorry, that, abstain?

27:38.858 --> 27:40.124
    He said, uh, that no sex.

27:40.126 --> 27:42.059
       It's a very delicate
          process, John.

27:42.061 --> 27:43.794
        We can't have you
      messin' up the works.

27:43.796 --> 27:45.729
          How long can't
         we have sex for?

27:45.731 --> 27:47.731
   -Between one and six months.
              -What?

27:47.733 --> 27:50.134
         Now, what's the
       success rate of IUI?

27:50.136 --> 27:51.935
       Statistics indicate
          it'll increase

27:51.937 --> 27:54.738
          the chance of
     conception by 10 to 15%.

27:54.740 --> 27:57.941
       -[John] Six months,
     is there another option?
     -In vitro fertilization.

27:57.943 --> 28:00.044
      We fertilize the egg
      with a sperm in a lab

28:00.046 --> 28:02.212
    and implant the fertilized
       egg into the uterus.

28:02.214 --> 28:04.081
         Okay, what's the
       probability of IVF?

28:04.083 --> 28:06.016
        -Hm, fifty-fifty.
           -Fantastic.

28:06.018 --> 28:07.985
      IVF, we can have sex
      during that, right?

28:07.987 --> 28:09.987
      No way. And it's not
      as simple as picking

28:09.989 --> 28:11.755
  one procedure over the other.

28:11.757 --> 28:13.757
       IVF while effective,
        is very expensive.

28:13.759 --> 28:15.926
        Insurance usually
      refuses to pay unless

28:15.928 --> 28:18.762
    you've gone through three
    rounds of Clomid and IUI.

28:18.764 --> 28:21.165
       Well, how expensive
          is expensive?
         Like, ballpark.

28:21.167 --> 28:23.801
      Ballpark? Talkin' 25.

28:23.803 --> 28:26.770
    25, 2,500, that's doable.

28:26.772 --> 28:28.238
             25,000.

28:30.042 --> 28:33.243
      Okay, so if we wanted
      to do IVF right now,

28:33.245 --> 28:34.812
we'd have to pay out of pocket?

28:34.814 --> 28:37.047
        [John chuckling]

28:37.049 --> 28:39.450
     All right, Mr. Mumbles,
         what's goin' on?

28:39.452 --> 28:43.454
    I just, you know, I mean,
     six months without sex?

28:43.456 --> 28:47.057
   -$25,000 dollars. No beer.
   -What are you, in college?

28:47.059 --> 28:49.193
      I have to drink beer,
    it's part of my business.

28:49.195 --> 28:51.762
        -[Katie] Are you a
   professional booze bag now?
        -Also sex is part

28:51.764 --> 28:53.931
       of my lifeblood too.
           I am a man.

28:53.933 --> 28:55.766
      No, you don't have to
           do anything,
     I gotta do all the work.

28:55.768 --> 28:57.868
      All you have to do is
    just jack off into a jar.

28:57.870 --> 28:59.837
      -Jack off into a jar?
      -You have to jack off
           into a jar.

28:59.839 --> 29:01.505
    Oh, like it's that easy.

29:01.507 --> 29:03.073
 -It is that easy, just fuckin'.
         -[fist thudding]

29:03.075 --> 29:04.942
          -Listen to me.
             -Mm-hmm.

29:04.944 --> 29:06.276
      I'm not just some run
     of the mill doctor here

29:06.278 --> 29:09.046
to give you the means to an end.

29:09.048 --> 29:11.148
 Think of me as an emancipator.

29:11.150 --> 29:13.517
      I invade the male and
   female reproductive organs,

29:13.519 --> 29:16.153
     liberating children into
   the world and I'm very good

29:16.155 --> 29:17.955
      at what I do, but the
     one thing I can tell you

29:17.957 --> 29:21.225
      for certain, a house
      divided cannot stand.

29:23.229 --> 29:25.295
     -[light dramatic music]
         -If this works,

29:25.297 --> 29:27.197
       we'll have a baby.

29:32.872 --> 29:34.505
              Okay.

29:34.507 --> 29:35.806
          Let's do it.

29:35.808 --> 29:38.142
  Did you guys rob a pharmacy?

29:38.144 --> 29:42.146
      Provera, Clomiphene.

29:42.148 --> 29:47.050
       Letrozole and Toxi--
            Tamoxifen.

29:47.052 --> 29:49.119
            -Exactly.
        -Tamoxifen, okay.

29:49.121 --> 29:50.988
           All right.

29:50.990 --> 29:53.056
             -Who me?
          -Here you go.

29:53.058 --> 29:54.892
        She's your wife.

29:54.894 --> 29:57.127
      You're the strongest,
   you gotta get through this.

29:57.129 --> 29:59.263
         All right, think
       you can handle this?

29:59.265 --> 30:03.867
     Yes, I just, as long as
      I don't see the needle
         I am good to go.

30:03.869 --> 30:06.003
        Just don't tell me
     when you're gonna do it,
           just do it.

30:06.005 --> 30:07.538
         No, tell me when
       you're gonna do it.

30:07.540 --> 30:08.939
         Don't tell when
       you're gonna do it.

30:08.941 --> 30:10.340
         No, tell me when
       you're gonna do it.

30:10.342 --> 30:12.109
           Don't tell--
      ah yeah, there it is.

30:12.111 --> 30:14.144
            -I did it.
        -Yeah, no, I know.

30:14.146 --> 30:16.814
       -[Maria] It's good,
        you're doin' good.
           -Thank you.

30:16.816 --> 30:19.550
  It's worth it, it's worth it,
  it's worth it, it's worth it.

30:19.552 --> 30:21.051
             -Katie.
             -Yeah?

30:21.053 --> 30:22.953
       -Your mother's here.
              -What?

30:22.955 --> 30:25.122
          -What the hell
        is she doing here?
        -[Katie groaning]

30:25.124 --> 30:27.558
        Farts. I told her
       that I would look at
       a mole on her back.

30:27.560 --> 30:29.960
           -[John] Oh.
           -Ah, okay.

30:29.962 --> 30:31.962
         Wait, why are we
       freaking out though?

30:31.964 --> 30:33.997
      Because she cannot see
   any of this, this is a sin.

30:33.999 --> 30:37.201
      -[John] What's a sin?
         -The church only
       condones procedures

30:37.203 --> 30:38.969
     that assist conception.

30:38.971 --> 30:40.971
  -Yeah, it's gotta be natural.
              -Yeah.

30:40.973 --> 30:42.873
       -What about the IUI?
     -[Katie] No, IUI's okay.

30:42.875 --> 30:44.174
             -Hello?
      -[Katie] No, it's not.

30:44.176 --> 30:45.943
           Yeah, yeah,
       yeah, Vatican says.

30:46.912 --> 30:48.245
            Anybody?

30:48.247 --> 30:50.113
              -Hi.
              -Hi.

30:51.584 --> 30:53.884
      Hi, what's goin' on?

30:53.886 --> 30:55.853
            Ah, why?

31:00.359 --> 31:02.960
          [Katie sighs]

31:02.962 --> 31:04.261
          Hello, hello.

31:04.263 --> 31:06.196
         [clears throat]
          Hello, hello.

31:06.198 --> 31:07.931
      No, no, no, no, okay.

31:07.933 --> 31:08.932
       [knocking on door]

31:08.934 --> 31:10.901
            Come in.

31:12.104 --> 31:14.371
               -Hi.
    -Hi, listen, I just wanted

31:14.373 --> 31:17.608
  to apologize for jumping down
    your throat the other day.

31:17.610 --> 31:19.209
       Oh, no, that was--

31:19.211 --> 31:21.111
     Sometimes my mamma bear
        instincts come out

31:21.113 --> 31:22.379
         -and watch out.
      You know what I mean?
              -Yeah.

31:22.381 --> 31:24.014
        Well, you will if
       you ever have kids.

31:24.016 --> 31:26.416
          But I do wanna
        make it up to you.

31:26.418 --> 31:29.019
     You know, it's funny you
  say that about the kids thing,

31:29.021 --> 31:31.388
   because my husband and I are
  about to start a round of IUI.

31:31.390 --> 31:33.390
    We've been trying to get
pregnant for a really long time,

31:33.392 --> 31:35.626
        hasn't really been
          going our way.
     So, we're gonna do this.

31:35.628 --> 31:37.961
      I don't know why I'm
      telling you all this.

31:37.963 --> 31:39.663
  When I get nervous I tend to
  blather a little bit, and...

31:39.665 --> 31:43.200
       Okay, great story,
       Katie, thank you.

31:43.202 --> 31:45.936
    The reason I called you in
  is because the executive level

31:45.938 --> 31:48.372
    -wants to hear more about
     those vendor discounts.
          -What, really?

31:48.374 --> 31:50.674
    That would be the breast,
              best.

31:50.676 --> 31:54.111
      -I need you to make a
   complete presentation on it.
             -Mm-hmm.

31:54.113 --> 31:56.280
       The C-level, they're
  hearing good things about you

31:56.282 --> 31:58.916
   and this is your chance to
   prove what you are made of.

31:58.918 --> 32:01.451
      -If you're up for it.
        -Yeah, oh, my God.
           I'm pumped.

32:01.453 --> 32:03.654
        Katie, look at me,
    I need you to focus here.

32:03.656 --> 32:05.989
  Normally, this is something
that I would take on for myself.

32:05.991 --> 32:08.659
           -Of course.
        -But with Jimothy
       starting Montessori

32:08.661 --> 32:11.128
    and Higgins is just, like,
      flying back and forth
    to Vienna for her recitals

32:11.130 --> 32:13.130
    -and I just have no time.
        -I don't even know
         what that means.

32:13.132 --> 32:14.665
      And because you don't
 have kids, I just thought that,

32:14.667 --> 32:16.199
  you know, maybe you would have
          the bandwidth

32:16.201 --> 32:17.968
       to do a decent job.

32:17.970 --> 32:19.336
          Right, yeah.

32:19.338 --> 32:22.372
      Oh, and good luck with
       the whole IUI thing.

32:22.374 --> 32:26.209
     Yeah, okay, Mamma Bear.

32:26.211 --> 32:30.213
         So, anyway, just
      give you some privacy.

32:30.215 --> 32:31.982
      Oh, no, you can leave
      that open, it's fine.

32:31.984 --> 32:34.718
          -Really, okay.
        -Yeah, thank you.

32:34.720 --> 32:37.020
         [phone ringing]

32:37.022 --> 32:38.288
           Dr. Remis.

32:38.290 --> 32:40.324
   Hey, Dr. Remis, John Kelly.

32:40.326 --> 32:42.225
       [Dr. Remis] What can
      I help you with, John?

32:42.227 --> 32:45.028
     Well, um, I think Katie
      might be experiencing

32:45.030 --> 32:47.197
   some side effects from the
   drugs you prescribed her.

32:47.199 --> 32:49.266
   What sort of side effects?

32:49.268 --> 32:51.335
       Like, she threatened
     to leave me if I didn't

32:51.337 --> 32:53.303
       stop overloading the
  dishwasher kinda side effects.

32:53.305 --> 32:56.306
        That's the Clomid,
   it can trigger mood swings.

32:56.308 --> 32:58.108
      Any erratic behavior?

33:01.213 --> 33:03.246
              What?

33:03.248 --> 33:05.749
       -You could say that.
    -[Katie] Don't look at me!

33:05.751 --> 33:08.719
  The effect of these chemicals
      can best be described
       as PMS on steroids.

33:08.721 --> 33:10.420
     Eventually her chemistry
      is gonna balance out,

33:10.422 --> 33:12.155
it's just gonna take some time.

33:12.157 --> 33:14.191
       All right, whatever
     you say, Doc, thank you.

33:14.193 --> 33:15.726
              -John,
             -[gasps]

33:15.728 --> 33:17.060
       I need you to go to
     the store and I need you

33:17.062 --> 33:18.729
  to get me a pressure washer.

33:18.731 --> 33:24.134
      -A pressure washer?
      -A pressure... yeah!

33:24.136 --> 33:25.736
       -Okay, I'm gonna go.
      -Yeah, you're gonna go

33:25.738 --> 33:28.472
    'cause I asked you to go.

33:29.341 --> 33:31.742
        [Katie groaning]

33:31.744 --> 33:33.510
          [light music]

33:37.783 --> 33:39.516
         [Katie sighing]

33:52.431 --> 33:56.333
[Katie, with an accent] You're a
pirate and you're on your vessel

33:56.335 --> 34:00.170
       and it's full steam
     ahead to fertile island.

34:02.107 --> 34:05.108
      [Dr. Remis] I've got a
     good feeling about this.

34:33.304 --> 34:35.472
       [Katie] You roll up
          in your Camaro

34:35.474 --> 34:37.574
        and you're wearing
           a top hat...

34:37.576 --> 34:39.275
            -[groans]
       -...and I'm wearing

34:39.277 --> 34:42.545
         a wedding dress,
      even though it's prom.

34:42.547 --> 34:44.614
         -[phone ringing]
             -Oh, oh.

34:46.284 --> 34:47.818
        -Just one second.
        -Are you serious?

34:47.820 --> 34:50.152
               Hey.
      No, no, I'm not busy.

34:50.155 --> 34:53.090
      [Dr. Remis] I've got a
    great feeling about this.

35:25.657 --> 35:27.591
          The spinning's
         making me dizzy.

35:27.593 --> 35:29.526
   [woman] We have others that
  need this room, please hurry.

35:29.528 --> 35:32.329
          You know what,
        we need the room.

35:37.302 --> 35:39.669
       [Dr. Remis] This is
     the one, I just know it.

35:55.220 --> 35:56.419
             [Maria]
       Look at it this way,

35:56.421 --> 35:58.455
         at least now you
       can try IVF, right?

35:58.457 --> 36:02.425
    Oh, God no. I don't think
           I can, um...

36:02.427 --> 36:05.162
     -Do we like this angle?
          -[Maria] Yeah.

36:05.164 --> 36:07.364
        -Just kinda shows
         what it can do.
    -[Maria] Yeah, it's sexy.

36:07.366 --> 36:10.634
             -Great.
    -Yeah, I don't think I can
 do anymore of those treatments.

36:10.636 --> 36:16.206
      I just don't think...
    physically or emotionally
       my body can take it.

36:16.208 --> 36:18.375
   I need to apologize to you.

36:18.377 --> 36:19.943
            For what?

36:19.945 --> 36:21.711
        I thought you not
        getting pregnant

36:21.713 --> 36:23.713
was just something in your head.

36:23.715 --> 36:27.651
  Oh no, don't. Please, I can't
    expect you to understand.

36:27.653 --> 36:29.553
             I mean,
     kids came easy for you.

36:29.555 --> 36:31.188
            Too easy.

36:31.190 --> 36:32.589
              Hmm.

36:32.591 --> 36:35.192
         But I gotta say,
   being a parent to those kids

36:35.194 --> 36:38.562
      is somehow the hardest
   and the most wonderful thing
          we'll ever do.

36:38.564 --> 36:43.633
               -Mm.
  -What I'm saying is that what
    you're trying for is good.

36:45.270 --> 36:47.971
     And I wanna do anything
   I can to help you get there.

36:47.973 --> 36:51.675
          Aw, thank you.
   Still not gonna take Dougie.

36:51.677 --> 36:54.344
      [motorcycle rumbling]

37:13.699 --> 37:15.966
         I don't suppose
        you're into this,

37:15.968 --> 37:18.668
    but have you ever thought
     of alternative methods?

37:18.670 --> 37:20.470
           I feel like
      I've tried everything.

37:20.472 --> 37:22.305
   What about quantum healing?

37:22.307 --> 37:24.507
         [Gordon] Honey,
        the boss is home.

37:24.509 --> 37:26.610
         -We're in here.
       -Does he really come
        himself The Boss?

37:26.612 --> 37:28.311
            -Yeah, no.
         -I kinda, okay.

37:28.313 --> 37:29.379
          I don't know.

37:29.381 --> 37:30.714
        What's up, Katie?

37:30.716 --> 37:32.983
      -Where have you been?
             -Gordon.

37:32.985 --> 37:35.285
     What I was just sparing
   at the dojo with Sifu Kevin.

37:35.287 --> 37:37.554
   Is that your... what are you
    showing us, what is that?

37:37.556 --> 37:39.689
            -[laughs]
       -This, oh, my tri's.

37:39.691 --> 37:41.758
       -Where are the kids?
          -Watching TV.

37:41.760 --> 37:43.493
               Oh.

37:43.495 --> 37:46.263
            Doin', uh,
     doin' some karate, huh?

37:46.265 --> 37:48.398
            No, Katie,
      I'm not doing karate.

37:48.400 --> 37:51.001
    I'm studying the ancient
    Chinese art of kung fu.

37:51.003 --> 37:52.669
     I did karate as a kid.

37:52.671 --> 37:54.471
       -I was a blue belt.
         -[Katie] Really?

37:54.473 --> 37:57.474
        Yeah, I could like
     break boards and stuff.

37:57.476 --> 37:59.476
       -Yeah, it was easy.
     -Gordon's a white belt.

37:59.478 --> 38:01.011
          Well, everyone
         knows the colors

38:01.013 --> 38:02.679
         are different in
     kung fu and karate, so.

38:02.681 --> 38:05.482
            Do they?
'Cause I don't know if that's...

38:05.484 --> 38:08.051
    I feel like white's still
   pretty much like the lowest.

38:08.053 --> 38:10.387
          You know what,
    kung fu's way more badass,

38:10.389 --> 38:12.622
   so white belt in kung fu is
   like a blue belt in karate.

38:12.624 --> 38:15.025
               -Ah.
   -But can you break a board?

38:15.027 --> 38:16.693
      I can probably break,
        like, six boards.

38:16.695 --> 38:18.428
        What are you guys
     doing on my sculpt lab?

38:18.430 --> 38:21.031
      I'm going to sell this
       hunk of shit online.

38:21.033 --> 38:22.799
  -And I'm helping by modeling.
              -Yes.

38:22.801 --> 38:25.035
         -No, I use that.
    -You never use this thing.

38:25.037 --> 38:26.636
  -[Katie] It's covered in dust.
     -What are you talkin'--

38:26.638 --> 38:27.771
        How do you think
        I get this, man?

38:27.773 --> 38:29.606
    [Katie] Beer and nachos?

38:29.608 --> 38:32.042
      When was the last time
          you used that?

38:32.044 --> 38:34.311
   Seriously, give me a date.

38:34.313 --> 38:36.446
      Okay, I'm gonna get
      my exercise journal,

38:36.448 --> 38:39.449
       I'm gonna show you.
         Check that out.

38:41.386 --> 38:43.753
           So, quantum,
       what is it, healing?

38:43.755 --> 38:45.555
              Yeah.

38:45.557 --> 38:46.756
        Right after I had
    the baby I started getting

38:46.758 --> 38:48.491
  these terrible panic attacks.

38:48.493 --> 38:50.393
     You never told me that.

38:50.395 --> 38:52.829
     I was almost catatonic,
  I could barely get out of bed.

38:52.831 --> 38:56.466
     My doctor was no help,
     so my yoga instructor

38:56.468 --> 38:58.501
      put me in touch with
      this holistic healer.

38:58.503 --> 39:01.338
         -And it helped?
   -Like you wouldn't believe.

39:01.340 --> 39:03.740
    I know this sounds crazy,
     but it changed my life.

39:03.742 --> 39:05.709
     So, you think he could
     help me get pregnant?

39:05.711 --> 39:08.345
  It can't hurt to try, right?

39:09.548 --> 39:11.614
     But I have to warn you,
       he's a little weird.

39:11.616 --> 39:13.083
           Weird how?

39:13.085 --> 39:15.685
      It's hard to explain.

39:15.687 --> 39:18.688
             -Honey.
        -[Gordon grunting]

39:18.690 --> 39:20.457
 How would you describe Caesar?

39:20.459 --> 39:23.360
      -Oh, the holistic guy?
              -Yeah.

39:23.362 --> 39:25.428
   Yeah, he's a fuckin' creep.

39:25.430 --> 39:27.530
     -He's perfect for Katie.
           Ha ha, burn.
         -You know what?

39:27.532 --> 39:30.100
       Boom, boo-ba, bang.

39:30.102 --> 39:32.135
   [Katie] Is he a white belt?

39:32.137 --> 39:33.703
            Namaste.

39:33.705 --> 39:35.839
        Are you currently
      experiencing physical,

39:35.841 --> 39:37.707
  mental or spiritual anguish?

39:37.709 --> 39:39.876
   How about lower back pain,
   IBS, or suicidal thoughts?

39:39.878 --> 39:41.711
      Have you grown weary
      of western medicine's

39:41.713 --> 39:44.781
      profit driven approach
       to your well being?

39:44.783 --> 39:47.684

      most trusted holistic
         healing center.

39:52.557 --> 39:56.126
    If it weren't for Caesar,
 I'd be dead, and that's a fact.

39:56.128 --> 40:00.630
           Yes, it is.
      Together we can start
  treating causes not symptoms.

40:00.632 --> 40:02.732
   Give me a call, I'm Caesar.

40:04.136 --> 40:05.869
       Give Caesar a call.

40:05.871 --> 40:09.706
 [TV] Namaste, are you currently
      experiencing physical,

40:09.708 --> 40:11.808
  mental or spiritual anguish?

40:11.810 --> 40:13.910
   How about lower back pain,
   IBS, or suicidal thoughts?

40:13.912 --> 40:16.446
      Have you grown weary
      of western medicine's

40:16.448 --> 40:18.782

       to your well being?

40:18.784 --> 40:21.484
         Then join me at
     Caesar's Healing Palace,

40:21.486 --> 40:24.921
   San Fernando Valley's most
trusted holistic healing center.

40:24.923 --> 40:27.824
       [man] If it weren't
     for Caesar, I'd be dead.

40:27.826 --> 40:29.526
         Oh, you gotta be
       fuckin' kidding me.

40:29.528 --> 40:32.195
       Okay, can you please
    try to keep an open mind?

40:32.197 --> 40:34.597
       -Keep an open mind?
      -[TV] Give me a call.

40:34.599 --> 40:35.932
         That's society's
       polite way of saying

40:35.934 --> 40:38.435
        "get ready to hear
     some serious bullshit."

40:38.437 --> 40:40.870
        [Caesar humming]

40:52.951 --> 40:54.818
        -What is he doing?
           -I don't...

40:54.820 --> 40:59.222
          Hi, I'm Katie,
       this is John, and...

40:59.224 --> 41:01.624
      I just, I don't think
           that he's...

41:01.626 --> 41:04.727
          -Can I just...
           -[snapping]

41:04.729 --> 41:07.831
       -[Caesar screaming]
            -[gasping]

41:07.833 --> 41:09.632
     Dammit! I was this close
      to total enlightenment
      and then you came in.

41:09.634 --> 41:11.201
      I'm so sorry, I didn't
    know you were in a thing.

41:11.203 --> 41:13.570
       I didn't, we didn't,
          I'm so sorry.

41:14.940 --> 41:17.207
        You'll be pleased
      to know I was joking.

41:17.209 --> 41:19.476
         -Uh-huh, uh-huh.
    -You actually can't break

41:19.478 --> 41:21.644
        my concentration,
        it's impossible.

41:21.646 --> 41:26.516
 About two years ago I was lost
 in the deserts of New Mexico.

41:26.518 --> 41:29.219
       I found my way out
       by taking handful

41:29.221 --> 41:31.554
    -after handful of peyote.
               -Oh.

41:31.556 --> 41:34.858
    I road the snake all the
    way back to civilization.

41:34.860 --> 41:37.660
     When they found me I was
      naked, running through

41:37.662 --> 41:39.863
           a turquoise
     jewelry market in Taos.

41:39.865 --> 41:41.931
              -Wow.
        -Every since then
         I've been living

41:41.933 --> 41:45.568
     in an inescapable state
       of total awareness.

41:45.570 --> 41:47.537
      Oh, how fun for you.

41:47.539 --> 41:49.606
    So, I imagine you're here
   for the weight loss program?

41:49.608 --> 41:51.708
         The what-- what?
           No, no, no.

41:51.710 --> 41:53.543
        Sorry, I was just
     looking at your thighs.

41:53.545 --> 41:55.778
        -Oh, no, I'm, no.
       -Skin rejuvenation?

41:55.780 --> 41:57.847
            No, wait,
       do you do that here?

41:57.849 --> 41:59.983
        We're here because
  we're trying to get pregnant.

41:59.985 --> 42:01.985
          Yes, we really
        wanna have a baby.

42:01.987 --> 42:03.853
           Ah, kudos.

42:03.855 --> 42:07.090
      Oh, didn't know there
    was a liquid "u" in kudos.

42:07.893 --> 42:09.692
               Oh.

42:09.694 --> 42:10.727
      Feeling your energy.

42:10.729 --> 42:12.962
       [Katie] Feel away.

42:12.964 --> 42:15.665
           [sniffing]

42:15.667 --> 42:17.967
        -You're ovulating.
     -[Katie] I don't-- okay.

42:17.969 --> 42:21.271
     When strippers ovulate,
       they make more money

42:21.273 --> 42:24.007
at the strip club because of the
 pheromones they're giving off.

42:24.009 --> 42:25.708
     Isn't that interesting?

42:25.710 --> 42:27.710
       [Katie] Do you think
         I'm a stripper?

42:27.712 --> 42:28.978
   So if you were a stripper
   right now at a strip club,

42:28.980 --> 42:31.080
         you'd be making
        it rain hardcore.

42:31.082 --> 42:32.715
    You'd be covered in cash.

42:32.717 --> 42:34.617
          -Good to know.
        -Covered in cash.

42:34.619 --> 42:36.619
          Okay, uh-huh.

42:36.621 --> 42:38.087
            Let's...

42:38.089 --> 42:40.290
        The good news is,
     I can get you pregnant.

42:40.292 --> 42:41.691
           -Oh, really?
              -Yeah.

42:41.693 --> 42:42.892
     You can get us pregnant,
              right?

42:42.894 --> 42:44.027
         But first I have
        to get inside you.

42:44.029 --> 42:45.662
               -Oh.
           -Excuse me?

42:45.664 --> 42:47.630
         -Okay, I mean...
            -Herbally.

42:47.632 --> 42:49.832
      Right, yes, of course,
  of course, herbally, herbally.

42:49.834 --> 42:53.069
      He needs to herbally
      be inside me, okay.

42:53.071 --> 42:55.071
          It'll be easy,
   so long as you haven't done

42:55.073 --> 42:58.041
    -any fertility treatments.
            -[groans]

42:58.043 --> 43:00.310
          Let me guess.

43:00.312 --> 43:02.912
         You went to some
       fertility specialist

43:02.914 --> 43:06.316
    who put you on a grueling
       three month program
      of poisonous hormones

43:06.318 --> 43:09.819
     and invasive treatments.
 And then when that didn't work,

43:09.821 --> 43:12.722
     -because it never works.
        -Yeah, that's now
        exactly how it...

43:12.724 --> 43:16.893
    They sold you on some pie
  in the sky in vitro treatment.

43:16.895 --> 43:19.095
       Right? Am I right?

43:19.097 --> 43:22.131
      Have you ever thought
       for even one moment

43:22.133 --> 43:23.800
      that they don't want
      you to get healthy.

43:23.802 --> 43:25.335
    They wanna keep you sick

43:25.337 --> 43:27.904
         so they can make
        that filthy lucre.

43:27.906 --> 43:30.873
 It's all about the cash, baby.

43:30.875 --> 43:33.343
  You stay sick, they get rich.

43:33.345 --> 43:34.777
         Think about it?

43:34.779 --> 43:36.346
Who would ever suggest to anyone

43:36.348 --> 43:37.947
    that you could have a baby
       without having sex.

43:37.949 --> 43:39.949
          Yes, exactly.

43:39.951 --> 43:41.951
   That's what they did, right?
    They told you not to bone.

43:41.953 --> 43:44.387
     They told us not to bone
 for like a month to six months.

43:44.389 --> 43:46.923
       I want you to bone.

43:46.925 --> 43:49.125
       -I want you to slam.
      -Are you hearing this?

43:49.127 --> 43:51.127
      -I want you to smash.
             -Smash.

43:51.129 --> 43:54.364
     -Jackhammer, jackhammer.
       -Nobody likes that.

43:54.366 --> 43:55.365
        -That's too fast.
           -Yeah, well.

43:55.367 --> 43:56.366
            [humming]

43:56.368 --> 43:57.934
     No, nobody likes that.

43:57.936 --> 44:00.103
           -I like it.
       -You gotta bone down

44:00.105 --> 44:03.840
       all night long till
   the break of god damn dawn.

44:03.842 --> 44:06.075
           I feel like
     I'm gonna be in a lot...

44:06.077 --> 44:08.077
    -I feel I'll be very sore.
           -[John] No.

44:08.079 --> 44:09.712
     -[Caesar] Ideally, yes.
               -Oh.

44:09.714 --> 44:11.881
        You need to start
        a detox program.

44:11.883 --> 44:13.850
     Just her or both of us?

44:13.852 --> 44:15.652
   It's for both of you, yes.

44:15.654 --> 44:17.387
       Tabby, get in here.

44:17.389 --> 44:18.988
             -Tabby.
             -Tabby!

44:18.990 --> 44:20.723
         Is this a cat?

44:20.725 --> 44:22.392
       We also need to get
       you started on FRP.

44:22.394 --> 44:23.893
      -I'm sorry, what now?
              -For?

44:23.895 --> 44:25.995
            Fertility
     revitalization program.

44:25.997 --> 44:29.065
       It's an all natural,
    GMO free, virility remedy.

44:29.067 --> 44:31.668
     It's kind of like the
     dick pills you can get

44:31.670 --> 44:34.003
      at a truck stop if the
 tuck stop was in ancient China.

44:34.005 --> 44:36.939
     Okay, um, and what does
       the package include?

44:36.941 --> 44:38.141
        Just the basics.

44:38.143 --> 44:40.410
        Nano acupressure,
        wellness formula,

44:40.412 --> 44:41.911
  a lunar fornication calendar.

44:41.913 --> 44:43.780
            I'm sorry,
     what was that last part?

44:43.782 --> 44:45.148
      It's a calendar based
    on the cycles of the moon

44:45.150 --> 44:47.016
     that tells you exactly
     when you need to fuck.

44:47.018 --> 44:49.952
     -Yes, I like that a lot.
             -Okay...

44:49.954 --> 44:51.921
        You guys are gonna
         love this part.

44:51.923 --> 44:53.222
          It's an app.

44:53.224 --> 44:55.224
         Sounds an alarm
     when it's time to smash.

44:55.226 --> 44:58.795
   -[dogs barking and howling]
        -I'm in, we're in.

44:58.797 --> 45:00.129
    -Can you change the alarm?
         -Take our money.

45:00.131 --> 45:01.764
            -Sound or?
         -Take our money.

45:01.766 --> 45:02.832
            -Oh, yeah.
      -That gets you going?

45:02.834 --> 45:04.200
       That gets me going.

45:04.202 --> 45:06.836
         Having a lunar,
       you know, calendar.

45:06.838 --> 45:08.838
    I have a lunar calendar.

45:08.840 --> 45:10.940
        Every woman does,
        but that's fine.

45:10.942 --> 45:12.842
           -Oh, hello.
        -Tabby, be a lamb

45:12.844 --> 45:14.777
            and please
      set these two souls up

45:14.779 --> 45:17.447
    with a two week supply of
 Caesar's detoxifying tea blend.

45:17.449 --> 45:20.917
           -Wrong way.
      -Thank you, Tabby, oh.

45:22.053 --> 45:24.187
       [Caesar] Thank you.

45:24.189 --> 45:26.189
          Is she okay?

45:42.974 --> 45:46.275
         -[upbeat music]
       -[kettle whistling]

45:53.118 --> 45:55.151
           -Yeah? Okay.
               -Mm.

45:55.153 --> 45:56.953
              Okay.

45:59.991 --> 46:01.858
           Oh, my God.

46:01.860 --> 46:04.961
          Oh, it's like,
  it's like a little bit lumpy.

46:04.963 --> 46:06.229
  Yeah, I lied, it's terrible.

46:06.231 --> 46:07.830
        It's a little bit
        lumpy going down.

46:18.243 --> 46:19.776
             Tabby!

46:19.778 --> 46:22.345
         [trippy music]

46:27.018 --> 46:30.119
        [giggling] John.

46:30.121 --> 46:32.188
              Yeah?

46:33.825 --> 46:36.092
        There's something
      wrong with the clock.

46:44.936 --> 46:46.536
           John, John.

46:46.538 --> 46:49.539
       Oh, where'd you go?

46:49.541 --> 46:51.140
    -[Bird's voice] Impotence.
        -[numerous voices]

46:51.142 --> 46:53.543
          -Use hop oil?
      -[woman's voice] Dad.

46:53.545 --> 46:55.845
             [Gordon]
      Those are 500 year old
   German beer laws, who cares?

46:55.847 --> 46:57.113
             [woman]
          Titty bonanza.

46:57.115 --> 46:58.314
           [Dr. Remis]
    It's a real show stopper.

46:58.316 --> 46:59.549
     [Caesar] Filthy lucres.

46:59.551 --> 47:01.350
        -Sperm count low.
              -Slam.

47:01.352 --> 47:03.352
            -[Gordon]
      Loud pipes save lives.
      -[motorcycle rumbling]

47:05.356 --> 47:07.990
          [light music]

47:07.992 --> 47:10.560
            [cooing]

47:10.562 --> 47:12.895
               Hi.

47:20.004 --> 47:22.371
      Thank you, kind sir.

47:24.909 --> 47:27.577
        She's beautiful.

47:27.579 --> 47:29.278
        Built like John.

47:29.280 --> 47:34.917
      -Thank you, love her.
      -[children giggling]

47:34.919 --> 47:37.954
   [Dr. Remis] Let me tell you
         a little story.

47:37.956 --> 47:40.323
 After the first day of fighting
     at the Battle of Shiloh,

47:40.325 --> 47:43.326
   Will T. Sherman saw General
   Grant sitting under a tree,

47:43.328 --> 47:46.229
  contemplating the devastating
        losses of the day.

47:46.231 --> 47:48.197
         Sherman said to
    his friend, "Well, Grant,

47:48.199 --> 47:50.933
          you've had the
  devil's own day, haven't we?"

47:50.935 --> 47:54.337
    Grant concurred and said,
   "Lick 'em tomorrow, though."

47:54.339 --> 47:58.274
              -Lick?
       -The next day Grant
    routed the enemy and won.

47:59.210 --> 48:01.043
Do you know what he did to win?

48:01.045 --> 48:02.245
           [Katie] Hm?

48:02.247 --> 48:04.180
         Well, I tell you
        what he didn't do.

48:04.182 --> 48:06.015
        He didn't go on a
       magical mystery tour

48:06.017 --> 48:08.384
  with a god damn witch doctor,
    that's what he didn't do.

48:08.386 --> 48:11.220
    He won because he didn't
    have the option to lose.

48:11.222 --> 48:13.923
   He had that fire within him
      and superior artillery

48:13.925 --> 48:15.925
       on his right flank,
    but a fire just the same.

48:15.927 --> 48:18.094
  It's that fire, that desire
  to win that I need from you.

48:18.096 --> 48:20.096
      Do you know why IUI
      didn't work for you?

48:20.098 --> 48:24.667
     Uh, poor egg quality,
bad fallopian tubes, poor sperm.

48:24.669 --> 48:26.335
     No. John, tell her why.

48:26.337 --> 48:28.037
        'Cause we didn't
        have that fire.

48:28.039 --> 48:30.940
        Bingo. Now I know
   you've had a rough go of it.

48:30.942 --> 48:33.009
       Years of passionless
        manual conception,

48:33.011 --> 48:34.343
followed by three rounds of IUI

48:34.345 --> 48:36.112
        is enough to make
       anybody wanna quit,

48:36.114 --> 48:38.047
        and I know that's
      what you're thinkin',

48:38.049 --> 48:40.116
     "Let's quit, we weren't
     meant to have a baby."

48:40.118 --> 48:42.318
 But we need to rise above that.
        We need that fire.

48:42.320 --> 48:43.986
       I'm gonna ask you a
       question right now,

48:43.988 --> 48:46.122
        are you ready for
     in vitro fertilization?

48:46.124 --> 48:48.457
          Yeah, ready.

48:48.459 --> 48:50.393
      God damn it, I'll give
     you everything I've got,

48:50.395 --> 48:52.361
    but if you're not willing
      to give me everything

48:52.363 --> 48:54.096
    you've got then I'll climb
     the steps to Appomattox

48:54.098 --> 48:55.398
  and I'll surrender right now.

48:55.400 --> 48:57.133
    I'm gonna ask you again,

48:57.135 --> 48:58.935
        are you ready for
     in vitro fertilization?

48:58.937 --> 49:00.169
              -Yes.
          -Ready to go.

49:00.171 --> 49:01.270
        Do you have the
        fire within you?

49:01.272 --> 49:02.471
   Are you ready to procreate?

49:02.473 --> 49:04.407
              -Yes.
        -Yes, I'm on fire.

49:04.409 --> 49:07.009
      -Ready, I've got fire.
        -I'm on fire, yes!

49:07.011 --> 49:09.679
  -Back draft, put a baby in me.
           -[Dr. Remis]
       John, are you ready?

49:09.681 --> 49:11.981
         -Say it with...
 -[John] I'm ready to procreate.

49:11.983 --> 49:13.249
       [nurse] Ugh, again.

49:37.408 --> 49:39.375
         Father Callahan,
           how are you?

49:39.377 --> 49:41.310
              -Hey.
         -Hey, what's up?

49:41.312 --> 49:43.245
     -What do you got there?
              -What?

49:43.247 --> 49:44.714
              -Cake.
        -Cake, I got cake,
          that's right.

49:44.716 --> 49:46.082
         [Maria] Oh, you
       want me to take it?

49:46.084 --> 49:47.416
    No, no, no, no, I got it.

49:47.418 --> 49:48.451
       I'm just gonna put
       it in the kitchen.

49:48.453 --> 49:49.518
   Special cake I guess, okay.

49:49.520 --> 49:51.220
      Why you acting weird?

49:51.222 --> 49:52.521
            -Shut up.
              -Okay.

49:54.392 --> 49:56.359
  I need to have sex right now.

49:56.361 --> 49:58.227
        -What is-- oh my--
  -I need to have sex right now.

49:58.229 --> 50:00.129
         God, you need to
       put that thing away.

50:00.131 --> 50:01.464
  That is gonna hurt somebody.

50:01.466 --> 50:05.301
           Okay, okay,
       no, no, no, stop it.

50:05.303 --> 50:08.170
        This is a child's
      first communion party.

50:08.172 --> 50:09.338
          Oh, who cares,
     I don't care about them.

50:09.340 --> 50:11.073
 Let's go upstairs really fast.

50:11.075 --> 50:12.308
      -I can be really fast.
         -I know you can,

50:12.310 --> 50:14.243
 I'm fully aware it'll be fast,

50:14.245 --> 50:16.112
      -but I-- No, we can't,
       we can't, we can't.
              -Why?

50:16.114 --> 50:18.180
      I just started a whole
 new round of drugs for the IVF,

50:18.182 --> 50:20.516
            my body is
         way too volatile
      to handle all of that.

50:20.518 --> 50:23.185
   One time won't hurt, right?
            One time.

50:23.187 --> 50:25.554
      Just one quick time.

50:25.556 --> 50:27.256
          Don't make me
       be the bad guy here.

50:27.258 --> 50:29.558
     -Okay, I will give you.
            -Oh, wow.

50:29.560 --> 50:34.764
    -Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
    -20, 40, 50... 5, 56, 57.

50:34.766 --> 50:37.767
    -$57, I will give you $57
      -Honey, honey, honey.

50:37.769 --> 50:39.368
         -and a receipt,
         -And a receipt.

50:39.370 --> 50:41.037
         if you have sex
    with me right now. Please.

50:41.039 --> 50:42.371
   You can go get a mani-pedi.

50:42.373 --> 50:44.373
         You're gonna pay
        your wife for sex?

50:44.375 --> 50:47.510
      That's just, that's a
   whole other level of wrong.

50:47.512 --> 50:49.445
     -It's a turn on, right?
    -You need to go upstairs,

50:49.447 --> 50:51.447
     you need to get changed.
            I'm sorry.

50:51.449 --> 50:54.283
            -Oh, God.
       -I'm sorry, just go.

50:54.285 --> 50:55.584
     -Get rid of that, okay?
           -All right,

50:55.586 --> 50:58.087
             but it's
   gonna take me a little time

50:58.089 --> 50:59.822
       'cause I have to...
       unload the weapon.

50:59.824 --> 51:02.491
     All right, just fire off
         a couple rounds.

51:02.493 --> 51:04.326
     -I'm gonna fire it off.
              -Okay.

51:04.328 --> 51:06.128
  I'm gonna hit it everywhere.

51:06.130 --> 51:07.329
              Oh...

51:07.331 --> 51:10.599
  [John] Oh hey kids, hey guys.

51:11.602 --> 51:16.205
            -[mumbles]
         -[woman moaning]

51:22.480 --> 51:24.547
          -[music stops]
       -We brought a cake.

51:24.549 --> 51:26.582
   -What happened to the music?
    -[Bluetooth speaker beeps]

51:26.584 --> 51:29.118
        -[woman moaning]
        -[hand pounding]

51:29.120 --> 51:30.820
 -[woman] Oh, that's disgusting.
           -Oh, my God.

51:30.822 --> 51:32.621
  -That's gotta be John, right?
     -How is this happening?

51:32.623 --> 51:34.623
       This is not, this is
    not what you think it is.

51:34.625 --> 51:37.093
       -It sounds a lot...
      -[Maria] Do something.

51:37.095 --> 51:39.161
     [woman] You better grab
      that child right now.

51:39.163 --> 51:41.564
   -[Katie] Kids, sing a song.
      -Come here, come here,
            come here.

51:41.566 --> 51:44.400
            Come here!
        Cover those ears.

51:46.404 --> 51:49.205
       John, John, everyone
    can hear you jacking off.

51:49.207 --> 51:51.507
            [moaning]

51:54.479 --> 51:57.113
        Well, if you drove
         across the lawn

51:57.115 --> 51:59.582
        then you have to
        pay for damages.

51:59.584 --> 52:02.351
              Yeah,
    that's kinda how it works.

52:02.353 --> 52:06.555
     Because you drove across
   the lawn, which means you...

52:06.557 --> 52:09.625
     I can't, you know what,
   I gotta go, Mom, I gotta go.

52:15.266 --> 52:16.599
               Oh.

52:16.601 --> 52:19.268
      WTF is right, Katie.

52:19.270 --> 52:21.203
        Have you talked to
      the insurance company?

52:21.205 --> 52:23.672
         Yeah, of course.
  I mean, we're over our limit.

52:23.674 --> 52:26.375
Any other infertility treatments
     will be out of pocket.

52:26.377 --> 52:29.178
        But they wanted us
       to do the IUI first.

52:29.180 --> 52:30.613
     We wanted to go straight
       to the IVF remember?

52:30.615 --> 52:33.349
     I know, I know, I don't
     know what to tell you.

52:33.351 --> 52:35.451
         Well, that's it,
          no IVF for us.

52:35.453 --> 52:36.886
           What, why?

52:36.888 --> 52:38.654
       Where are we gonna
       get $30,000 from?

52:38.656 --> 52:40.456
           We could use
        the brewery money.

52:40.458 --> 52:42.224
         You're kidding.

52:43.161 --> 52:44.560
  That would set me back years,

52:44.562 --> 52:45.928
        I'd have to start
         all over again.

52:45.930 --> 52:47.329
         Well, you could
        ask your brother.

52:47.331 --> 52:50.399
      -Bam, problem solved.
            -I can't.

52:50.401 --> 52:51.934
       You mean, you won't.
       He has the money and
        he wants to help.

52:51.936 --> 52:53.669
  It's too much to ask of him.

52:53.671 --> 52:56.205
       He's got his family,
        he's got his job.

52:56.207 --> 52:58.407
          -I can't ask.
     -John, we are so close.

52:58.409 --> 53:00.910
 -We've scheduled the retrieval.
         -Then cancel it.

53:00.912 --> 53:03.612
          Why can't you
       compromise on this?

53:03.614 --> 53:05.915
         Do you-- do you
       want a baby or not?

53:05.917 --> 53:07.516
       We have been saving
      that money for years.

53:07.518 --> 53:08.918
       I don't wanna roll
       the dice with it.

53:08.920 --> 53:10.619
      Oh, my God, we're not
        rolling the dice,

53:10.621 --> 53:12.922
      we're not gambling.
      We're having a baby.

53:12.924 --> 53:14.256
    What if it doesn't work?

53:14.258 --> 53:15.658
            It will.

53:15.660 --> 53:17.493
      You don't know that.

53:17.495 --> 53:19.695
      What if the IVF fails?
            Then what?

53:19.697 --> 53:21.397
We're out the 30 grand and then

53:21.399 --> 53:22.631
we have to start all over again.

53:22.633 --> 53:24.300
 Have you even considered that?

53:24.302 --> 53:25.935
        Oh, my God, you're
       being such a D head.

53:25.937 --> 53:28.737
      You know, the brewery
   is not a sure thing either.

53:28.739 --> 53:30.606
  Oh hey, you know what, I just
     thought of a great name

53:30.608 --> 53:33.642
     for your IPA, how about:
  My Husband is a Selfish Prick

53:33.644 --> 53:36.278
  Who Only Cares About Himself,
               IPA?

53:36.280 --> 53:37.546
    That sounds really good.

53:37.548 --> 53:38.747
   I actually like that name,

53:38.749 --> 53:40.482
  but it won't sell as well as:

53:40.484 --> 53:41.750
            My Wife is
      Completely Irrational

53:41.752 --> 53:43.719
               and
 Financially Reckless, Pale Ale.

53:43.721 --> 53:45.487
     [Katie] How about this,
   you should call your pilsner

53:45.489 --> 53:47.289
          My Husband Is
         a Massive D Hole

53:47.291 --> 53:49.291
    Who Never Follows Through
        With His Promises.

53:49.293 --> 53:50.726
         That's the one.
         That's the one,
       I like that better.

53:50.728 --> 53:52.528
     You know what, I'm gonna
   get that started right now.

53:52.530 --> 53:54.430
       [Katie] Yeah, well,
    don't forget the hop oil.

53:54.432 --> 53:57.366
          [John] Okay.

54:00.705 --> 54:02.538
               Oh.

54:09.313 --> 54:10.679
      Hi, I'm your driver.

54:10.681 --> 54:12.281
      I need you to take me
         to the hospital.

54:12.283 --> 54:13.782
   Oh, my gosh, are you okay?

54:13.784 --> 54:15.985
            Holy shit,
      this is so much pain.

54:15.987 --> 54:18.020
        Are you in labor?

54:18.022 --> 54:20.589
          -Oh, are you a
        fucking detective?
        -Congratulations.

54:20.591 --> 54:24.293
    -You know, my wife and I--
            -Shut up!
  Just take me to the hospital.

54:24.295 --> 54:26.729
     I'm gonna lose my window
       to get an epidural.
        Just get me there.

54:26.731 --> 54:29.498
     You want me to take the
    freeways or side streets?

54:29.500 --> 54:31.000
     Just drive, fuck face!

54:31.002 --> 54:32.735
       Side streets it is.

54:32.737 --> 54:35.571
         Go-- in the go!
   Why are the belts like this?

54:35.573 --> 54:38.507
   You're pulling it too fast.
         You need to just
          pull it slowly

54:38.509 --> 54:41.410
        -and then it'll--
  -Okay, I'm getting it on now.

54:44.382 --> 54:45.814
       Um, are you hungry?

54:45.816 --> 54:47.716
      I have a half eaten
      protein bar up here.

54:47.718 --> 54:49.418
    Can I give you an Altoid?
         I have Altoids.

54:49.420 --> 54:51.487
  -No, I need you to pull over.
           -Pull over?

54:51.489 --> 54:53.289
     I thought you wanted me
   to take you to the hospital.

54:53.291 --> 54:54.690
      I'm gonna have another
           contraction,

54:54.692 --> 54:56.292
         and your driving
       is making it worse.

54:56.294 --> 54:57.493
  I'm sorry, I can't pull over,

54:57.495 --> 54:58.761
        it's the middle of
         an intersection.

54:58.763 --> 55:00.329
      Stop the car or I will
          choke you out

55:00.331 --> 55:02.731
       with your seatbelt.
            Oh, fuck!

55:02.733 --> 55:04.566
         -[cars honking]
           -Oh, my God,

55:04.568 --> 55:07.369
          I'd rather die
        than get another.

55:07.371 --> 55:08.470
               Oh.

55:08.472 --> 55:10.372
          Are you okay?

55:10.374 --> 55:12.041
              -Yeah.
          -You're good?

55:12.043 --> 55:15.377
             -Uh-huh.
           -Okay, okay.

55:15.379 --> 55:17.579
        We gotta get you
        to the hospital.

55:17.581 --> 55:18.814
      Hold on to your shit.

55:20.785 --> 55:24.386
       Everybody, make way,
  woman in labor comin' through.

55:24.388 --> 55:26.622
          -Oh, it hurts.
  -Meg, honey, oh, are you okay?

55:26.624 --> 55:28.757
    -[John] Who is this guy?
    -[Meg] My husband, Brad.

55:28.759 --> 55:30.726
        -Oh, well, thanks
      for showing up, Brad.
          -Are you okay?

55:30.728 --> 55:32.795
        -How do you feel?
     -Like I'm gonna explode.

55:32.797 --> 55:34.563
    Your wife's contractions
    are five minutes apart,

55:34.565 --> 55:36.498
       we need to prep her
         for anesthesia.

55:36.500 --> 55:38.367
             -Nurse!
           -Anesthesia?
    You mean like an epidural?

55:38.369 --> 55:39.468
      Look, Brad, I know it
  wasn't part of the birth plan,

55:39.470 --> 55:40.769
  but your wife wants the juice

55:40.771 --> 55:42.471
       and I'm gonna make
       sure she gets it.

55:42.473 --> 55:43.572
             -Nurse.
  -Hold on, are you the doctor?

55:43.574 --> 55:44.840
              -Stop.
        -Brad, stand back,

55:44.842 --> 55:46.408
       she's having another
           contraction.

55:46.410 --> 55:48.344
            -Breathe.
    -Okay listen, you breathe.

55:48.346 --> 55:50.412
     Okay, listen, thank you
       for getting me here,

55:50.414 --> 55:52.681
         -but we have it.
          -Are you sure?

55:52.683 --> 55:54.083
              -Yeah.
    -You want me to with you?

55:54.085 --> 55:55.584
        I'll stay with you
          the whole way.

55:55.586 --> 55:56.819
          I don't think
       that's appropriate.

55:56.821 --> 55:59.822
        -Yeah, all right.
              -Okay.

55:59.824 --> 56:01.390
 I gotta have a baby now, okay?

56:01.392 --> 56:03.092
          -Who are you?
         -I'm the driver.

56:03.094 --> 56:04.660
     Yeah, he's the driver.

56:04.662 --> 56:07.396
            All right,
       we're havin' a baby.

56:07.398 --> 56:09.365
           [Meg] Yeah!

56:09.367 --> 56:11.467
        I really like the
      names Blaze and Plum.

56:11.469 --> 56:13.869
       [Meg] I like Plum,
       I don't like Blaze.

56:13.871 --> 56:16.505
     [light dramatic music]

56:21.879 --> 56:23.779
        I've got something
      to show you, come on.

56:23.781 --> 56:26.682
         I'm not a fan of
      not being in control.

56:26.684 --> 56:27.850
   I have a surprise for you.

56:27.852 --> 56:30.486
            -Ready?
            -Uh-huh.

56:31.655 --> 56:32.921
          What is that?

56:32.923 --> 56:34.857
     What does it look like?
           It's a crib.

56:34.859 --> 56:37.126
    Took me almost three hours
      to put this together.

56:37.128 --> 56:39.128
             [sighs]

56:39.130 --> 56:40.863
         I wanna do IVF.

56:40.865 --> 56:42.731
           No, but what
        about the brewery?

56:42.733 --> 56:44.166
      I'll save more money.

56:44.168 --> 56:45.634
      I wanna have a baby.

56:45.636 --> 56:47.736
      All right, but what if
         it doesn't work?

56:47.738 --> 56:49.171
            -What if--
          -It will work.
     Katie, it's gonna work.

56:49.173 --> 56:51.407
         No matter what,
    we're gonna make it work.

56:53.944 --> 56:56.612
        [Katie giggling]

56:57.882 --> 57:00.149
   That's a pretty sweet crib.

57:00.151 --> 57:02.751
  Yeah, it took me almost seven
   hours to put this together.

57:02.753 --> 57:05.921
        That doesn't match
      what you said earlier.

57:06.824 --> 57:08.657
  Now we just have to fill it.

57:13.631 --> 57:15.464
    Let me ask you something.

57:15.466 --> 57:17.933
        Did you are Maria

57:17.935 --> 57:21.637
        ever have problems
         getting pregnant
   when you first started out?

57:21.639 --> 57:24.740
        No, no, we had the
     exact opposite problem.

57:24.742 --> 57:27.709
I mean, look, first kid, bliss.

57:27.711 --> 57:30.179
    Second kid, game changer.

57:30.181 --> 57:34.583
      And then we had, um...
          the third one.

57:34.585 --> 57:36.985
              -Lisa.
          -Yeah, I wept.

57:36.987 --> 57:40.522
          -Tears of joy.
              -Fear.

57:40.524 --> 57:42.458
I had a massive anxiety attack.

57:42.460 --> 57:44.593
        I'll tell ya this,
  I'm never going camping again.

57:44.595 --> 57:46.795
   It's just so weird, I mean,
  we're trying all these things

57:46.797 --> 57:49.231
      and nothing's working
     and I'm pumping Katie up

57:49.233 --> 57:51.667
       with all these drugs
   like she's some race horse.

57:52.870 --> 57:55.671
         I'm sorry, man.

57:55.673 --> 57:58.540
         I'm sorry you're
       goin' through that.

57:58.542 --> 58:00.909
         Look, I'm gonna
        tell you something

58:00.911 --> 58:03.745
        somebody told me
        a long time ago.

58:03.747 --> 58:08.584
        You take the good
      and you take the bad.

58:08.586 --> 58:12.554
    You take it all and there
   you have the facts of life.

58:12.556 --> 58:14.623
     Is that the theme song
     to the Facts of Life?

58:14.625 --> 58:17.860
          -[Gordon] No.
     -That could be the worst
     advice I've ever gotten.

58:17.862 --> 58:20.696
  We're giving you a grandchild,
    Mom, that's what you want.

58:20.698 --> 58:22.631
       But not like this.

58:22.633 --> 58:25.868
     A life isn't something
     that should be ordered

58:25.870 --> 58:27.903
 from a catalog like a sweater.

58:27.905 --> 58:31.607
        Those treatments,
      they dehumanize life.

58:31.609 --> 58:33.242
    It's not like that, Mom.

58:33.244 --> 58:35.744
       A life is something
          that you earn.

58:35.746 --> 58:38.580
    Everyone, even the best
    of us, has to earn that.

58:38.582 --> 58:39.982
           This is why
    we didn't wanna tell you,

58:39.984 --> 58:42.618
    because some how you have
    managed to make creating

58:42.620 --> 58:44.720
         a life something
     I should be ashamed of.

58:44.722 --> 58:46.555
   Why can't you two just have

58:46.557 --> 58:48.991
normal sex like everybody else?

58:48.993 --> 58:51.727
        Honey, nothing in
       life is fair, okay?

58:51.729 --> 58:53.629
          And sometimes
     we just have to realize

58:53.631 --> 58:54.997
we're not gonna get what we want

58:54.999 --> 58:57.299
         and we accept it
    in order to move forward.

58:57.301 --> 59:00.002
      -What are you saying?
           -I am saying
       that maybe right now

59:00.004 --> 59:01.737
you are not meant to have kids.

59:01.739 --> 59:03.839
         I'm actually not
    looking for your approval,

59:03.841 --> 59:05.674
 so you can either hop on board

59:05.676 --> 59:08.677
         or you can just
     leave us the hell alone.

59:09.813 --> 59:11.547
            Honey...

59:30.034 --> 59:31.633
        Oh, good morning.

59:31.635 --> 59:32.868
         Morning, tiger.

59:32.870 --> 59:35.971
    You ready to be a father?

59:35.973 --> 59:38.307
       -You want this now?
               -No,

59:38.309 --> 59:41.710
      what I need you to do,
   is I need you to fill it up

59:41.712 --> 59:45.080
       and bring it to the
      hospital, 11:00 a.m..

59:45.082 --> 59:47.316
        Why the hospital?

59:47.318 --> 59:50.319
     Well, because Remis has
   to physically remove my eggs

59:50.321 --> 59:52.354
      and implant your sperm
        directly into 'em.

59:52.356 --> 59:54.790
          -Sounds sexy.
              -Mmm.

59:54.792 --> 59:57.659
     I mean, it's technically
    a surgical procedure so...

59:57.661 --> 59:59.995
      It's gotta be done at
     the hospital, I got it.
           11:00 a.m..

59:59.997 --> 01:00:02.631
     No, no, no, okay, that's
     not all, that's not all.
           You can't--

01:00:02.633 --> 01:00:06.935
   -Honey, you can't even be
a second late with the specimen.
          -[John] Why?

01:00:06.937 --> 01:00:08.837
 Well, because then we're gonna
have to reschedule for next week

01:00:08.839 --> 01:00:11.607
          and we do not
    have the money to do that.

01:00:13.677 --> 01:00:16.778
  Okay, great, so no pressure.

01:00:16.780 --> 01:00:19.815
      All right, 11:00 a.m.,
     hospital, I'll be there.

01:00:19.817 --> 01:00:22.818
              -Okay.
         -[phone ringing]

01:00:22.820 --> 01:00:25.954
           -Hey, babe.
    -[Katie] I'm checking into
   the hospital, are you close?

01:00:25.956 --> 01:00:28.090
       Oh, babe, you don't
     have to worry about me,

01:00:28.092 --> 01:00:29.992
   -I am currently in route.
   -[Katie] That's wonderful.

01:00:29.994 --> 01:00:31.960
        I even had time to
       pick up a passenger.

01:00:31.962 --> 01:00:34.096
             [Katie]
    You picked up a passenger?

01:00:34.098 --> 01:00:36.365
   Oh yeah, taking him to the
   hospital to see his mother.

01:00:36.367 --> 01:00:38.767
          -Grandmother.
        -Oh, grandmother.

01:00:38.769 --> 01:00:39.968
             [Katie]
    Do you have your specimen.

01:00:39.970 --> 01:00:41.703
         -You know I do.
             -Great.

01:00:41.705 --> 01:00:43.805
    Oh, hey, did you remember
       not to use any lube?

01:00:45.109 --> 01:00:46.742
              What?

01:00:46.744 --> 01:00:48.110
             [Katie]
     You can't use any lube.

01:00:48.112 --> 01:00:50.912
    Remember, it contaminates
        the entire sample.

01:00:52.116 --> 01:00:56.118
   -You used lube, didn't you?
          -No, I-- yes.

01:00:56.120 --> 01:00:58.987
       [Katie] Shit, John.
       You're gonna need to
     produce another sample.

01:00:58.989 --> 01:01:02.057
          Oh, come on.

01:01:02.059 --> 01:01:04.660
     You want me to go again,
          what am I, 17?

01:01:04.662 --> 01:01:07.396
       [Katie] John, we're
     gonna need a new sample.
 You have 37 minutes, handle it.

01:01:07.398 --> 01:01:09.865
              -Okay.
            -[laughs]
    Did you hear what I said?

01:01:09.867 --> 01:01:12.434
           -Handle it.
            -Bye bye.

01:01:12.436 --> 01:01:14.803
      Hey, I'm gonna have to
    make a really quick stop.

01:01:14.805 --> 01:01:17.005
    It's gonna be about five,
    10 minutes. It's gonna be
     really fast, all right?

01:01:17.007 --> 01:01:19.441
      So you just sit tight.
        You can play with
      the radio if you want.

01:01:19.443 --> 01:01:22.010
   Leave the engine running and
    I'll be right back, okay?

01:01:22.012 --> 01:01:24.946
      [man] But, but what?

01:01:48.772 --> 01:01:50.172
     Do you have a bathroom?

01:02:00.818 --> 01:02:02.718
         It's over here,
         come on, honey.

01:02:05.756 --> 01:02:10.192
             Oh, oh!
           Oh, my God!

01:02:10.194 --> 01:02:11.893
               Oh!

01:02:11.895 --> 01:02:13.762
         [John groaning]

01:02:21.071 --> 01:02:23.805
    A man, look, there he is!

01:02:23.807 --> 01:02:26.508
That's the sick pig right here.

01:02:26.510 --> 01:02:29.111
      -He was masturbating.
               -No.

01:02:29.113 --> 01:02:31.813
           No, no, no,
      you got it all wrong.

01:02:31.815 --> 01:02:34.082
     [officer] Don't resist.

01:02:34.084 --> 01:02:36.017
              [John]
     It's not what you think.

01:02:37.521 --> 01:02:39.488
           -[thudding]
         -[John groaning]

01:02:39.490 --> 01:02:41.056
              -Hi.
              -Hi.

01:02:41.058 --> 01:02:43.759
       -Ah. How ya feelin'?
          -Pretty good.

01:02:43.761 --> 01:02:45.160
          -How ya doin'?
      -Oh, good, thank you.

01:02:45.162 --> 01:02:46.895
 -Like, do you feel comfortable?
              -I do.

01:02:46.897 --> 01:02:49.831
       Do you feel anxious,
     a little nervous maybe?

01:02:49.833 --> 01:02:52.167
      What I like to do is
      I take deep breaths,

01:02:52.169 --> 01:02:54.069
 -you know, when I feel anxious.
        -Okay, sure, yeah.

01:02:54.071 --> 01:02:55.504
           I can tell,
       your eyes are kinda

01:02:55.506 --> 01:02:57.506
        darting back and
        forth and stuff.

01:02:57.508 --> 01:02:59.841
        -I don't think I--
  -That's not gonna make a baby.

01:02:59.843 --> 01:03:02.844
    -Oh, okay, thank you so--
     -You know, visualization
           helps a lot.

01:03:02.846 --> 01:03:05.514
     Let's make you look real
   pretty for the doctor, okay?

01:03:05.516 --> 01:03:07.149
            -Oh, okay.
  -All right, you feelin' good?

01:03:07.151 --> 01:03:08.884
       -Yeah, pretty good.
           -Okay good.

01:03:08.886 --> 01:03:10.952
       -Is my husband here?
               -No.

01:03:10.954 --> 01:03:16.291
            [groaning]
    Officer, officer, this is
    really a misunderstanding.

01:03:16.293 --> 01:03:19.861
  [officer] A big boy like you,
   shoulda filled up that jar.

01:03:19.863 --> 01:03:23.064
         -You guys today.
    -Grab that bottle please.

01:03:23.066 --> 01:03:25.267
           Your diets,
       what are you vegan?

01:03:25.269 --> 01:03:27.102
     He'll be here, he's...

01:03:27.104 --> 01:03:31.373
     -Sure, I'm sure he will.
              -Okay.

01:03:33.110 --> 01:03:35.877
       Well, I can't blame
      you for tryin' to run.

01:03:35.879 --> 01:03:38.013
I can't imagine this is gonna be
        an easy thing to
      explain to the wife.

01:03:38.015 --> 01:03:40.282
      Officer, I am so sorry
           that I ran,

01:03:40.284 --> 01:03:42.217
        but hey, you have
         to listen to me.
  I have to get to the hospital.

01:03:42.219 --> 01:03:44.586
       You know, most cops
     hate it when perps run,

01:03:44.588 --> 01:03:47.255
     but I actually like it,
         I encourage it.
 I enjoy that brisk cardio blast

01:03:47.257 --> 01:03:50.025
         -of a foot race,
     there's nothing like it.
   -Sir, you have to let me go.

01:03:50.027 --> 01:03:52.060
     When I'm in the vehicle
    sometimes I do isometrics.

01:03:52.062 --> 01:03:54.162
       I'm always on, off,
        on, off, on, off,

01:03:54.164 --> 01:03:57.232
     -but like 2-300 of 'em.
       -This is just a huge
        misunderstanding.

01:03:57.234 --> 01:03:59.901
    My legs are super strong.
   It's genetics or something.

01:03:59.903 --> 01:04:01.303
     I don't know, the Irish
       or the Scots in me.

01:04:01.305 --> 01:04:03.004
 I need one of those, you know,

01:04:03.006 --> 01:04:04.906
         those DNA tests
     where you swab yourself,

01:04:04.908 --> 01:04:06.608
      you send it in for $99
    and you see what happens.

01:04:06.610 --> 01:04:08.176
   But that gets weird because
       the test comes back,

01:04:08.178 --> 01:04:10.178
          I don't know,
  what are you, Native American?

01:04:10.180 --> 01:04:12.080
   Then you have to go out and
       buy all new clothes

01:04:12.082 --> 01:04:13.248
           -and stuff.
         -The doctor was
      gonna use that sample

01:04:13.250 --> 01:04:15.050
  to fertilize my wife's eggs.

01:04:15.052 --> 01:04:17.586
          Wait a minute,
    you're saying right here,

01:04:17.588 --> 01:04:20.055
        this is for what,
       fertility treatment.

01:04:20.057 --> 01:04:23.024
            Yes, yes,
 that's exactly what I'm saying.

01:04:23.026 --> 01:04:25.227
  Is it IUI or is it in vitro?

01:04:25.229 --> 01:04:27.162
              IVF.

01:04:27.164 --> 01:04:29.865
     Huh, did your insurance
         company make you

01:04:29.867 --> 01:04:31.933
     go through three rounds
     of IUI before the IVF?

01:04:31.935 --> 01:04:33.335
              -Yeah.
     -Because I'm tellin' you

01:04:33.337 --> 01:04:35.070
        right now, my wife
     and I were on the phone

01:04:35.072 --> 01:04:37.205
       for hours and hours,
    hell I was gonna fly down

01:04:37.207 --> 01:04:38.907
    to Costa Rica, get a kid,
         put it in a box

01:04:38.909 --> 01:04:40.375
  and then bring it back here.

01:04:40.377 --> 01:04:42.077
   Which is weird and probably
       wrong but anything--

01:04:42.079 --> 01:04:43.311
         -Sir, sir, sir.
      -to keep Debbie happy.

01:04:43.313 --> 01:04:44.946
     -I don't wanna be rude,
              -Huh?

01:04:44.948 --> 01:04:46.348
           but the life
      of my potential child

01:04:46.350 --> 01:04:48.216
        is sitting on your
    dashboard and if I am not

01:04:48.218 --> 01:04:50.418
   at the hospital in the next
   seven minutes all is lost.

01:04:50.420 --> 01:04:52.621
            Well, son,
     I got some news for ya,

01:04:52.623 --> 01:04:55.223
the hospital is 15 minutes away.

01:04:57.427 --> 01:04:59.261
            All right,
      hold on to your shit.

01:04:59.263 --> 01:05:01.897
   -I'll get you there in five.
        -[sirens wailing]

01:05:04.167 --> 01:05:06.167
       [tires screeching]

01:05:08.038 --> 01:05:10.005
         Thank you, sir.

01:05:18.015 --> 01:05:20.148
        Yeah, yeah, okay.

01:05:20.951 --> 01:05:22.384
          Oh, come on.

01:05:24.988 --> 01:05:26.254
    Make way, comin' through.

01:05:26.256 --> 01:05:29.157
     Hi, hi, I'm John Kelly.

01:05:29.159 --> 01:05:31.326
        This is my semen.

01:05:33.030 --> 01:05:37.265
        Sorry, Mr. Kelly,
        you're too late.

01:05:37.267 --> 01:05:39.434
             -What?
             -Mm-hm.

01:05:39.436 --> 01:05:41.670
        Missed it by about
           two minutes.

01:05:41.672 --> 01:05:46.341
             -No, no.
        -[nurse laughing]

01:05:47.477 --> 01:05:50.011
   I'm just kidding, you fine.

01:05:50.013 --> 01:05:51.446
       Look at your face.

01:05:51.448 --> 01:05:54.316
       It was like, oh...

01:05:54.318 --> 01:05:56.418
        Where's my wife?

01:05:56.420 --> 01:05:58.453
         Oh, they puttin'
       her under right now.

01:05:58.455 --> 01:05:59.988
      I wanna be with her.

01:05:59.990 --> 01:06:01.423
            Oh, well,
    you'll have to wait here.

01:06:01.425 --> 01:06:03.124
      The doctor will be out
     with you when he's done.

01:06:03.126 --> 01:06:04.426
      It won't be too long.

01:06:04.428 --> 01:06:06.361
     [light dramatic music]

01:06:10.067 --> 01:06:11.433
              John.

01:06:11.435 --> 01:06:13.301
       Doctor, how is she,
       is everything okay?

01:06:13.303 --> 01:06:15.136
        We need to talk.

01:06:15.138 --> 01:06:17.205
              [John]
       Is something wrong?

01:06:17.207 --> 01:06:18.740
          Have a seat.

01:06:18.742 --> 01:06:21.710
           I have some
     hard things to tell you.

01:06:21.712 --> 01:06:23.311
        And I'm not gonna
      sugar coat it for ya.

01:06:23.313 --> 01:06:25.513
           What is it,
        what's the matter?

01:06:25.515 --> 01:06:27.482
      It's about your IPA.

01:06:27.484 --> 01:06:29.117
              What?

01:06:29.119 --> 01:06:30.518
        My wife and I had
    the pleasure of indulging

01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:32.253
        in the beer sample
          you sent over,

01:06:32.255 --> 01:06:34.155
  -you're truly an artist, John.
           -Thank you,

01:06:34.157 --> 01:06:36.458
        -but how's Katie?
        -I don't normally
       enjoy a wheat beer,

01:06:36.460 --> 01:06:39.761
  but that Hefeweizen was a true
   delight, it was apple crisp.

01:06:39.763 --> 01:06:42.163
        That's wonderful,
        but how is Katie.

01:06:42.165 --> 01:06:44.733
    -The surgery, is she okay?
        -Oh, that couldn't
       have gone smoother.

01:06:44.735 --> 01:06:47.435
        -She's vibrant and
         strong as ever.
         -Oh, thank god.

01:06:47.437 --> 01:06:50.071
   Wish I could say the same
   about your India Pale Ale.

01:06:50.073 --> 01:06:53.174
It lacked the customary boldness
 I've come to expect in an IPA.

01:06:53.176 --> 01:06:54.509
    Weak as a kitten's meow.

01:06:54.511 --> 01:06:57.145
             Noted.

01:06:57.147 --> 01:06:59.481
             Anyway,
   Katie's eggs have been sent
  to the lab for fertilization.

01:06:59.483 --> 01:07:01.349
       Once they're ready,
     we'll bring her back in,

01:07:01.351 --> 01:07:03.084
   implant them in her uterus.

01:07:03.086 --> 01:07:04.352
       Shouldn't take more
       than a couple days.

01:07:04.354 --> 01:07:05.487
         In the meantime,
       you should consider

01:07:05.489 --> 01:07:07.422
  using a more potent hop oil.

01:07:09.259 --> 01:07:12.427
  There's-there's laws that...

01:07:12.429 --> 01:07:14.763
     I don't use a hop oil.

01:07:14.765 --> 01:07:17.332
          Add that hop,
        make it pop, baby.

01:07:17.334 --> 01:07:19.234
           [chuckles]

01:07:24.441 --> 01:07:27.275

          [Katie sighs]

01:07:29.446 --> 01:07:31.112
     Tell me something good.

01:07:31.114 --> 01:07:33.181
   Katie, we're ready for ya.

01:07:33.183 --> 01:07:34.549
         John, why don't
        you wait outside?

01:07:34.551 --> 01:07:36.351
  No, I wanna stay with Katie.

01:07:36.353 --> 01:07:38.253
        It won't be long.
    Have a seat in the lobby.

01:07:38.255 --> 01:07:43.358
      Doctor, I'm not gonna
       leave Katie's side.

01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:44.793
    I'm gonna stay with her.

01:07:44.795 --> 01:07:47.829
           [Dr. Remis]
      Very well, Mr. Kelly.

01:07:47.831 --> 01:07:49.531
        Put your gown on.

01:08:27.571 --> 01:08:31.573
       Okay, there you go.

01:08:34.845 --> 01:08:36.478
          How long till
       we get the results.

01:08:36.479 --> 01:08:38.446
    Just a couple of minutes.

01:08:38.448 --> 01:08:40.582
         The doctor will
     tell you in his office.

01:08:40.584 --> 01:08:42.350
        Fingers crossed.

01:08:42.352 --> 01:08:44.185
             Thanks.

         [somber music]

01:09:39.576 --> 01:09:41.209
You haven't really said anything

01:09:41.211 --> 01:09:43.310
  since we left Remis's office.

01:09:43.313 --> 01:09:44.444
            Taste it.

01:09:48.652 --> 01:09:51.486
           Oh, my God,
         that is so good.

01:09:51.488 --> 01:09:53.555
           You did it.

01:09:53.557 --> 01:09:57.525
        A west coast IPA,
    it's what everybody likes.

01:09:57.527 --> 01:09:59.727
       And I gotta admit,
       it's pretty good.

01:09:59.729 --> 01:10:01.729
   You should be really proud.

01:10:01.731 --> 01:10:03.364
        You worked hard.

01:10:03.366 --> 01:10:05.333
      We should celebrate.

01:10:08.538 --> 01:10:10.538
     -We can save more money.
            -Oh, God,

01:10:10.540 --> 01:10:12.607
          I don't wanna
       talk about that now.

01:10:12.609 --> 01:10:14.676
       Okay, you're upset.

01:10:14.678 --> 01:10:16.411
       No, I'm not upset.

01:10:16.413 --> 01:10:21.416
      I'm just-- I'm just...
        I'm disappointed.

01:10:21.418 --> 01:10:23.751
          Well, in me?

01:10:23.753 --> 01:10:26.955
         No, not in you,
        in the situation.

01:10:26.957 --> 01:10:29.457
      -What does that mean?
    -[sighs] Look, I just had

01:10:29.459 --> 01:10:32.493
  everything taken away from me
    that I've been working for
       for all these years,

01:10:32.495 --> 01:10:34.562
     I think I'm allowed to
     be disappointed, right?

01:10:34.564 --> 01:10:36.631
        And it's my fault,
     you think it's my fault?

01:10:36.633 --> 01:10:39.367
     I didn't wanna do this.

01:10:39.369 --> 01:10:41.836
     I didn't wanna take all
    of our money and put it...

01:10:42.973 --> 01:10:44.973
            Whatever.

01:10:44.975 --> 01:10:48.309
  -You know what, fuck it, okay?
   -No, no, you can't do this.

01:10:48.311 --> 01:10:51.412
      Because we both chose,
       we both chose this.

01:10:51.414 --> 01:10:52.780
       Okay, you're right,
     you're absolutely right,

01:10:52.782 --> 01:10:55.583
    and I want to have kids,
    I do, but I didn't know

01:10:55.585 --> 01:10:59.554
   that having babies with you
  meant not having sex with you.

01:10:59.556 --> 01:11:02.590
  Or it meant getting hand jobs
   in Trent Reznor's kill room

01:11:02.592 --> 01:11:05.426
      or taking Mescaline or
    getting fucking arrested.

01:11:05.428 --> 01:11:07.328
    No, I don't believe any of
   this, because you know what?

01:11:07.330 --> 01:11:09.597
     You actually never cared
        about having this

01:11:09.599 --> 01:11:11.466
        -That's bullshit.
      -All you cared about,

01:11:11.468 --> 01:11:13.001
       now you're trying to
     make me feel like shit.

01:11:13.003 --> 01:11:14.636
          Okay, you keep
      tellin' yourself that.

01:11:14.638 --> 01:11:17.605
     It's true, I have had to
   drag you through every step

01:11:17.607 --> 01:11:20.341
   of this and now you're just
     using your dumb brewery

01:11:20.343 --> 01:11:23.344
as something to make me, I don't
  know, somehow I'm wrong now.

01:11:23.346 --> 01:11:25.280
    You know what, I'm really
   happy that this all happened

01:11:25.282 --> 01:11:27.315
        because I learned
     something about myself.

01:11:27.317 --> 01:11:29.317
       What, that you're a
    shitty fucking beer maker?

01:11:29.319 --> 01:11:32.487
     No, that I can't be with
   a woman who can't have kids.

01:11:39.029 --> 01:11:40.628
         [Katie groans]

01:11:44.367 --> 01:11:46.034
              Shit.

01:11:46.036 --> 01:11:47.468
          [door closes]

01:11:53.643 --> 01:11:55.543
          [John sighs]

01:12:02.852 --> 01:12:05.553
    Katie, please let me in.

01:12:22.339 --> 01:12:25.606
         Hey, I need you
       to come pick me up.

01:12:31.681 --> 01:12:34.682
         Hey, little bro,
          how you doin'?

01:12:34.684 --> 01:12:38.519
    Yeah, never been better.

01:12:38.521 --> 01:12:40.121
      Yeah, looks like it.

01:12:40.123 --> 01:12:41.522
       You're supposed to
       be wearin' boxers.

01:12:41.524 --> 01:12:43.591
   It doesn't matter anymore.

01:12:43.593 --> 01:12:45.393
Hey, wanna play some ping pong?

01:12:45.395 --> 01:12:46.561
        No, no, I'm good.

01:12:46.563 --> 01:12:48.563
          Uh... Listen,

01:12:48.565 --> 01:12:51.099
         Maria and I have
     some people comin' over,
        new CFO from work.

01:12:51.101 --> 01:12:54.769
  Love to get ya to come inside
  and clean ya up a little bit.

01:12:56.706 --> 01:12:58.106
      You're ashamed of me.

01:12:58.108 --> 01:12:59.841
         I could never be
       ashamed of you, Bro,

01:12:59.843 --> 01:13:01.909
     Maria is ashamed of you,
         but you're fine.

01:13:01.911 --> 01:13:03.878
     [Maria] Gordon, tell him
       to put his pants on.

01:13:03.880 --> 01:13:06.647
  Well, I'm ashamed of myself.

01:13:06.649 --> 01:13:09.617
          I said things
      that cannot be unsaid.

01:13:09.619 --> 01:13:12.120
    [Gordon] That's not true,
    everything can be unsaid.

01:13:12.122 --> 01:13:14.856
  -That doesn't make any sense.
        -[Gordon] I know.

01:13:14.858 --> 01:13:16.591
       Why don't we get you
     inside and clean you up.

01:13:16.593 --> 01:13:18.593
      -[Maria] Gordon, now!
    -I'm bringing him inside!

01:13:18.595 --> 01:13:21.696
              Sorry.
       I'll be right down.

01:13:21.698 --> 01:13:23.865
       [John] All right,
       bring your paddle.

01:13:23.867 --> 01:13:26.768
   We'll play some ping pong.

01:13:32.442 --> 01:13:34.409
           [crashing]

01:13:35.145 --> 01:13:36.878
             [Danica]
       So I put baby corn,

01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:38.846
   baby carrots, baby peaches,

01:13:38.848 --> 01:13:41.749
 baby potatoes and he was like,
 "This is the strangest dinner

01:13:41.751 --> 01:13:43.518
       I've ever had," and
        I said, "Darling,

01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:44.886
I have something to tell you..."

01:13:44.888 --> 01:13:47.188
              -Hey.
              -Oh.

01:13:47.190 --> 01:13:49.490
  What's, uh, what's all this?

01:13:49.492 --> 01:13:52.794
        Oh, I'm pregnant.

01:13:52.796 --> 01:13:55.430
 [voice distorting] We weren't
 even trying, it just happened.

01:13:55.432 --> 01:13:56.564
       Can you believe it?

01:13:58.802 --> 01:14:01.903
        Fuck you and your
      fucking fertile face!

01:14:01.905 --> 01:14:03.738
           [screaming]

01:14:03.740 --> 01:14:06.507
         Aren't you happy
          for me, Katie.

01:14:06.509 --> 01:14:09.677
  I have never been more happy

01:14:09.679 --> 01:14:11.813
            than I am
    in this moment right now.

01:14:11.815 --> 01:14:13.648
         It's so great.

01:14:13.650 --> 01:14:15.716
          If it's a boy
       we're thinking that

01:14:15.718 --> 01:14:19.454
   we're gonna name him Brendo
    and if it's a girl, Talc.

01:14:19.456 --> 01:14:20.788
            -So cute.
              -Yeah.

01:14:20.790 --> 01:14:24.725
   Talc, like the powder Talc,
        like Talc powder?

01:14:24.727 --> 01:14:26.561
 Um, it's spelled the same way,

01:14:26.563 --> 01:14:31.199
    but it actually means song
     in Portuguese, I think.

01:14:31.201 --> 01:14:32.667
               Oh.

01:14:34.204 --> 01:14:35.803
             [sighs]

01:14:35.805 --> 01:14:37.772
      I don't wanna fight.

01:14:39.943 --> 01:14:42.543
        Bad timing, Mom.

01:14:42.545 --> 01:14:43.978
  Johnny told me what happened.

01:14:43.980 --> 01:14:47.682
   Yeah, well, you were right,
            I'm not...

01:14:47.684 --> 01:14:48.916
          I'm not meant
          to have kids.

01:14:48.918 --> 01:14:51.552
   No, I'm sorry I said that.

01:14:51.554 --> 01:14:54.622
        I just, I want you
         to know, honey,

01:14:54.624 --> 01:14:56.891
         that I really do
       understand the pain

01:14:56.893 --> 01:14:58.226
   that you're going through.

01:14:58.228 --> 01:15:00.228
 No, you don't know how I feel.

01:15:00.230 --> 01:15:02.763
       -You have no idea.
       -Yeah, I do, Katie.

01:15:02.765 --> 01:15:07.268
     I mean, after Dad and I
  got married we tried forever.

01:15:07.270 --> 01:15:10.671
       I mean, God, it was
      years to get pregnant.

01:15:10.673 --> 01:15:12.673
       Right, but that was
   different because dad wanted

01:15:12.675 --> 01:15:14.242
   to wait till he was out of
   the service to have kids.

01:15:14.244 --> 01:15:15.910
         No, no, that is
       what we told people,

01:15:15.912 --> 01:15:17.812
 but it wasn't the truth, okay?

01:15:17.814 --> 01:15:21.516
        We tried for years
      before you came along

01:15:21.518 --> 01:15:22.583
     and it was really hard.

01:15:22.585 --> 01:15:24.285
    I mean, it tore us apart.

01:15:24.287 --> 01:15:26.087
              Mm...

01:15:27.257 --> 01:15:29.891
        Oh, Mom, I don't
        know what to do.

01:15:29.893 --> 01:15:32.727
     -[light dramatic music]
  -I don't wanna feel like this.

01:15:33.530 --> 01:15:36.864
       I know, I'm sorry.

01:15:36.866 --> 01:15:42.904
   You know, I love you so much
     and I'll always be here.

01:15:49.312 --> 01:15:51.746
     -Are you gonna kick it?
      -No, just warmin' up.

01:15:51.748 --> 01:15:53.748
     -You are gonna kick it?
              -Nope.

01:15:53.750 --> 01:15:55.283
    You can't get higher than
  here, so I gotta put it down--

01:15:55.285 --> 01:15:56.751
    I'm not kickin' it, man.

01:15:56.753 --> 01:15:58.319
          Gordon, stop,
       what are you doing?

01:15:58.321 --> 01:15:59.987
     Oh hey, Maria, if you
     got your camera phone,

01:15:59.989 --> 01:16:01.923
      you're just in time to
    watch me break this board.

01:16:01.925 --> 01:16:04.559
  -You're gonna break your hand.
     -I'm not gonna punch it.

01:16:04.561 --> 01:16:05.993
     He's not gonna punch it,
   it's way too thick to punch.

01:16:05.995 --> 01:16:08.029
       Yeah, I'm gonna use
      my forehead. Titanium.

01:16:08.031 --> 01:16:09.764
       -Yeah, his forehead.
           -No, no, no,

01:16:09.766 --> 01:16:11.832
          stop trying to
   kill yourself, you dumbass.

01:16:11.834 --> 01:16:15.770
  Listen to me, you're a great
  dad, you're a great husband.

01:16:15.772 --> 01:16:19.674
  You have three healthy kids,
  a great wife that loves you.

01:16:19.676 --> 01:16:22.109
      You have everything a
     man could ever ask for,

01:16:22.111 --> 01:16:24.679
        and you're taking
         it for granted.

01:16:24.681 --> 01:16:27.782
          Maria, I hear
       what you're saying.

01:16:27.784 --> 01:16:30.685
     You're an amazing wife,
       a wonderful mother,
          kids love you,

01:16:30.687 --> 01:16:32.653
      I love them to death,
      I love you to death,

01:16:32.655 --> 01:16:34.121
     which is why I need you
     to move out of the way

01:16:34.123 --> 01:16:35.690
      and let me break this
       board with my face.

01:16:35.692 --> 01:16:37.692
        Okay, all right,
        wait, wait, wait.

01:16:39.062 --> 01:16:41.062
      If I let you do that,

01:16:41.064 --> 01:16:43.731
       will you take back
       that stupid bike?

01:16:43.733 --> 01:16:45.633
           Okay, fine.

01:16:45.635 --> 01:16:47.068
    If you guys don't want me
   to have bike, I don't care.

01:16:47.070 --> 01:16:49.604
         I'm doin' this.

01:16:49.606 --> 01:16:51.872
           -Go for it.
           -[grunting]

01:16:53.676 --> 01:16:55.142
             -[yells]
        -[board snapping]

01:16:56.813 --> 01:16:59.614
 -That's what I'm talkin' about.
           -[thudding]

01:17:01.884 --> 01:17:04.051
              Ha ha,
     told you I could do it.

01:17:04.053 --> 01:17:06.854
      Who looks stupid now?
             Not me.

01:17:06.856 --> 01:17:08.889
       [Gordon chuckling]

01:17:08.891 --> 01:17:10.891
   -I'm gonna get you new ice.
              -Okay.

01:17:10.893 --> 01:17:13.661
          -[Maria] John,
        you need anything?
      -No, I'm good thanks.

01:17:13.663 --> 01:17:15.696
-I'm gonna take off pretty soon.
      -Oh, you're leaving?

01:17:15.698 --> 01:17:19.033
     Yeah, I gotta go home.

01:17:19.035 --> 01:17:21.836
   Beg Katie for forgiveness.

01:17:22.905 --> 01:17:24.972
       That's a good idea.

01:17:24.974 --> 01:17:26.707
     I'll see ya later, man.

01:17:26.709 --> 01:17:29.176
           Hey, um...

01:17:31.014 --> 01:17:32.947
   I'm lookin' for a partner.

01:17:32.949 --> 01:17:35.683
  Someone with a keen business
  sense, somebody that's gonna

01:17:35.685 --> 01:17:37.118
         help me get this
     brewery off the ground.

01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:39.387
     So, if you know anybody,
       can you let me know?

01:17:39.389 --> 01:17:41.656
            [chuckles]
    I see where you're going.

01:17:41.658 --> 01:17:43.724
   Yeah, I think I do somebody
   and I think he's available.

01:17:43.726 --> 01:17:44.925
  Good, have him give me a call,
            all right?

01:17:44.927 --> 01:17:47.194
         -I will do that.
          -And you know,

01:17:47.196 --> 01:17:50.898
          Maria's right,
       you are a lucky guy.

01:17:51.734 --> 01:17:53.234
        Makes two of us.

01:17:54.103 --> 01:17:55.202
        [John] All right.

01:18:02.912 --> 01:18:04.945
     [light dramatic music]

01:18:45.021 --> 01:18:46.854
         We never, uh...

01:18:47.890 --> 01:18:52.827
  we never discussed... Cobra.

01:18:56.232 --> 01:18:58.866
       Thought it'd be cool
    if a boy was named Cobra,

01:18:58.868 --> 01:19:00.868
           -or a girl.
           -[chuckles]

01:19:03.873 --> 01:19:08.042
      Katie, I am so sorry.

01:19:08.044 --> 01:19:11.212
      I did not mean any of
      those things I said.

01:19:11.214 --> 01:19:14.749
         -I am so sorry.
      -No, I didn't either.

01:19:14.751 --> 01:19:17.151
          I want you to
      understand something.

01:19:19.021 --> 01:19:21.522
          I'm okay if it
      doesn't happen for us.

01:19:21.524 --> 01:19:24.492
      -You don't mean that.
           -Yes, I do.

01:19:24.494 --> 01:19:28.162
  Baby or no baby, it does not
  matter if I don't have you.

01:19:31.768 --> 01:19:35.970
      Okay, we need to make
       a rule, like a law,

01:19:35.972 --> 01:19:38.939
     that we never let this
     come between us again.

01:19:38.941 --> 01:19:42.209
    Yeah, absolutely, and then
   the penalty is what, like...

01:19:42.211 --> 01:19:43.911
      It's like five to 10.

01:19:43.913 --> 01:19:45.513
       -Five to 10 years.
       -Like in the hole.

01:19:45.515 --> 01:19:48.783
     [John] In the hole with
    no possibility of parole.

01:19:48.785 --> 01:19:50.885
              Yeah.

01:19:54.223 --> 01:19:56.257
     Tell me something good.

01:19:58.561 --> 01:20:00.227
      I wanna keep trying.

01:20:03.900 --> 01:20:05.933
      I wanna keep trying.

01:20:18.548 --> 01:20:20.948
            [grunts]

01:20:25.822 --> 01:20:29.223
   Hey Jeff, I still need that
 light bulb fixed in the office.

01:20:29.225 --> 01:20:30.891
         Coleman, can you
       help him with that?

01:20:30.893 --> 01:20:32.026
         He doesn't know
     anything about lighting.

01:20:32.028 --> 01:20:33.828
        [Coleman] Got it.

01:20:34.897 --> 01:20:36.263
             [Gordon]
    Oh, did you want your own?

01:20:36.265 --> 01:20:37.832
          This is mine.
        I can get you one.

01:20:37.834 --> 01:20:39.166
            -Gordon.
            -Mm-hmm?

01:20:39.168 --> 01:20:41.168
         Can you put this
      in the fridge for me?

01:20:41.170 --> 01:20:43.037
   Are you serving the beer or
   are you drinking all of it?

01:20:43.039 --> 01:20:44.205
          -I'm drinking.
           -You have a
       customer at the bar.

01:20:44.207 --> 01:20:45.873
 What is this, I don't do this.

01:20:45.875 --> 01:20:47.174
    -Hey, what can we get you?
               -Hi.

01:20:47.176 --> 01:20:50.144
         -[phone ringing]
    -Oh I'm sorry, one second.

01:20:50.146 --> 01:20:52.146
       Hey, where are you?
       We're busy as hell

01:20:52.148 --> 01:20:54.248
         and I need help
     getting a shipment out.

01:20:55.384 --> 01:20:57.885
 I'm gonna release you, because

01:20:57.887 --> 01:21:00.588
        -I really believe
        that this is fine
  -Oh, my God, John, I'm dying.

01:21:00.590 --> 01:21:02.990
        -She's not dying.
    -[John] What is goin' on?

01:21:02.992 --> 01:21:06.160
       It could be Malaria,
      it could be Dysentery.

01:21:06.162 --> 01:21:07.862
               -No.
         -We're not sure.

01:21:07.864 --> 01:21:09.897
      She's got a mild case
           of diarrhea.

01:21:09.899 --> 01:21:13.901
  Hey, hey, hey, if this is it,
   you go on without me, okay?

01:21:13.903 --> 01:21:15.269
 Maybe you don't get remarried,

01:21:15.271 --> 01:21:17.037
       maybe you just get,
          like, a studio

01:21:17.039 --> 01:21:19.106
in, like, Van Nuys or something.

01:21:19.108 --> 01:21:21.308
Be a lone wolf out on the range.

01:21:21.310 --> 01:21:23.210
         You just roam.

01:21:23.212 --> 01:21:25.346
         So, go ahead and
     give her some Kaopectate

01:21:25.348 --> 01:21:27.214
        and she should be
       fine by the morning.

01:21:27.216 --> 01:21:28.382
    -No, no, wait, wait, wait,
       -Feel better, honey.

01:21:28.384 --> 01:21:29.617
        I don't ever have
        digestive issues.

01:21:29.619 --> 01:21:31.252
    Something's really wrong.

01:21:31.254 --> 01:21:32.620
           That's true,
     she can eat like a goat.

01:21:32.622 --> 01:21:34.622
         -[man screaming]
             -Mm-hm,

01:21:34.624 --> 01:21:36.423
       honey, do you hear
       that man screaming?

01:21:36.425 --> 01:21:38.993
He's got a magicians dart stuck

01:21:38.995 --> 01:21:41.395
        in his eyeball and
    he really needs this room.

01:21:41.397 --> 01:21:43.097
        But, why is this
        happening to me?

01:21:43.099 --> 01:21:44.632
            -Oh, my--
    -I don't know, sweetheart.

01:21:44.634 --> 01:21:47.268
     -Maybe you're pregnant.
           -[groaning]

01:21:51.007 --> 01:21:53.173
       [tires screeching]

01:21:57.380 --> 01:21:59.313
        [uplifting music]

01:22:01.284 --> 01:22:03.350
        [Katie] Jackpot.

01:22:03.352 --> 01:22:05.319
   Here, here, take one more.

01:22:05.321 --> 01:22:07.321
          Just do both.

01:22:19.335 --> 01:22:21.201
          Are you okay?

01:22:25.141 --> 01:22:29.009
     Okay, we have to promise
       that no matter what

01:22:29.011 --> 01:22:31.412
 -this result is that we can't--
         -No, absolutely.

01:22:31.414 --> 01:22:35.015
      We can never do that
      to each other again.

01:22:37.453 --> 01:22:40.354
 -Something's coming up on mine.
         -Yeah, mine too.

01:22:42.692 --> 01:22:45.092
         [test beeping]
