WEBVTT

00:03.512 --> 00:06.310
Cheers is filmed before
a live studio audience.

00:06.672 --> 00:09.425
You sending another recorded
message home to the folks, Wood?

00:09.592 --> 00:12.550
Oh, yeah. lt's a lot cheaper
than a phone call.

00:13.952 --> 00:16.512
Hi, folks. This is your son, Woody...

00:16.672 --> 00:18.230
...Boyd.

00:19.672 --> 00:21.628
But enough about me.

00:21.792 --> 00:24.750
You know, things have been getting
really crazy around Cheers lately.

00:24.912 --> 00:26.584
Remember l told you that
Sam was going out

00:26.752 --> 00:30.267
with this real pretty politician lady
named Janet Eldridge?

00:30.432 --> 00:32.787
Well, things are still going
hot and heavy.

00:33.592 --> 00:35.344
Oh, Miss Chambers quit.

00:35.872 --> 00:39.831
Yeah, l think this stuff between Sam
and Miss Eldridge finally got to her.

00:39.992 --> 00:43.621
Anyway, she says she's never
coming back in here again.

00:43.792 --> 00:45.066
Gee, l'm gonna miss her.

00:45.432 --> 00:48.151
Well, that's it. Bye.

00:48.832 --> 00:50.584
Let's hear how it sounds.

00:53.992 --> 00:57.064
We shall fight on the seas
and the oceans.

00:57.232 --> 01:02.465
We shall fight in growing confidence
and growing strength in the air.

01:03.432 --> 01:04.581
You know, l guess it's true.

01:04.751 --> 01:08.267
You listen to the sound of your own
voice, it always sounds different.

02:20.672 --> 02:21.661
Afternoon, everybody.

02:21.872 --> 02:23.191
Norm!

02:23.352 --> 02:24.865
How you feeling today,
Mr Peterson?

02:25.072 --> 02:27.188
- Poor.
- Oh, l'm sorry to hear that.

02:27.352 --> 02:29.661
No, l meant, pour.

02:33.192 --> 02:36.662
- Trouble in paradise, Norm?
- No, at home, Cliffie.

02:36.832 --> 02:39.300
l just put Vera on the train
to Springfield.

02:39.792 --> 02:42.545
l have to spend the next few days
at home alone with her oversexed,

02:42.712 --> 02:45.624
exhibitionist sister, Donna.

02:46.032 --> 02:49.991
Maybe she's an innocent kid, and
you misinterpret her friendliness.

02:50.192 --> 02:51.545
Maybe you're right.

02:51.712 --> 02:55.307
You tell me, is it normal for a girl
to get dressed on the front lawn?

02:57.432 --> 03:00.390
Hey, hey.
Didn't you see the sign outside?

03:00.552 --> 03:04.261
We reserve the right to refuse service
to skinny ex-waitresses

03:04.432 --> 03:06.992
with bad dye jobs.

03:07.432 --> 03:11.141
Oh, Carla, couldn't we make
an exception just this once?

03:11.912 --> 03:13.265
Thanks, Woody.

03:13.432 --> 03:15.343
But l'm not here for the potables.

03:15.512 --> 03:17.230
l'm here to see Sam.

03:17.832 --> 03:21.381
He should be down in a few minutes.
He's at Melville's with Miss Eldridge.

03:21.552 --> 03:23.508
She's telling him what to say
and what not to say

03:23.672 --> 03:24.946
at the press conference today.

03:25.712 --> 03:27.270
Oh, there's a press conference?

03:27.472 --> 03:29.667
Yeah, and it's gonna be right here
in the bar.

03:30.272 --> 03:32.263
Oh, that's quite unorthodox.

03:32.472 --> 03:35.589
No, l think it's open to all faiths.

03:36.792 --> 03:39.352
l'll have a seltzer, please.

03:40.432 --> 03:42.582
Hey, whitey.

03:44.392 --> 03:47.065
About that dye job crack...

03:47.232 --> 03:49.143
...l'm sorry.

03:50.232 --> 03:54.145
You're sorry? l don't think l've heard
you say that before. Thanks, Woody.

03:54.632 --> 03:56.190
Yeah, l know.

03:56.352 --> 03:57.546
But...

03:57.712 --> 03:59.748
...l figure it's about time.

03:59.912 --> 04:03.700
l mean, now that you're
Boston's number-one loser,

04:03.872 --> 04:07.182
l'm feeling kind of different
about you.

04:07.352 --> 04:09.263
l'm flattered.

04:09.952 --> 04:11.863
ln fact...

04:12.512 --> 04:15.345
...l wanna apologize for all
the crummy things

04:15.512 --> 04:18.026
l've said to you over the years.

04:19.872 --> 04:22.181
Why, thank you, Carla.

04:22.832 --> 04:27.064
Except for that one
about your lizard lips.

04:27.632 --> 04:31.227
- l like that one.
- Exception noted.

04:31.392 --> 04:32.507
And...

04:32.672 --> 04:37.382
...you know, the one about you having
a personality you could store meat in.

04:37.552 --> 04:40.191
l'd like to keep that one alive too.

04:41.312 --> 04:43.951
This is so like you.

04:44.112 --> 04:49.869
Covering up what are obviously
some very fine, warm feelings.

04:50.032 --> 04:55.186
But l happen to know what you're
really saying is you like me.

04:55.872 --> 04:57.942
You're touching me.

04:59.312 --> 05:05.467
- lt's called communication.
- No, it's called a death wish.

05:06.432 --> 05:09.071
Hey, Diane, l understand
you're hitting the bricks

05:09.232 --> 05:11.109
in Unemployment City
there along with Normie.

05:11.312 --> 05:13.746
Oh, actually,
l've found other employment.

05:13.952 --> 05:16.864
Oh, yeah? See that, Norm?
What's the job that you landed there?

05:17.832 --> 05:19.185
Well...

05:19.352 --> 05:22.469
...it's only temporary until l hear about
this other job.

05:22.632 --> 05:25.192
ln fact, it's so temporary l don't even
bother to take my coat off

05:25.352 --> 05:28.150
when l'm there, if you get my point.

05:28.312 --> 05:31.304
l'm a checkout clerk
at Hurley's Market.

05:32.192 --> 05:33.944
What?

05:34.112 --> 05:36.785
A checkout clerk at Hurley's Market.
Are you deaf?

05:36.952 --> 05:38.908
Hey, Diane, that's where l shop.

05:39.072 --> 05:40.824
Next time l come in, l'll say hi.

05:41.032 --> 05:43.751
lf you don't, l'll be angry.

05:45.712 --> 05:48.067
Well, excuse me, l have to make a call
about that other job.

05:48.232 --> 05:51.622
l'm sure Sam won't mind me
using his office.

05:52.992 --> 05:54.823
Cheers.

05:54.992 --> 05:56.903
Oh, just a minute, please.

05:57.272 --> 05:59.467
lt's for you, Mr Peterson.

05:59.632 --> 06:00.906
Hello.

06:01.072 --> 06:04.382
- Oh, hi, Donna.
- Hey. Donna.

06:04.592 --> 06:06.469
Yeah.

06:07.432 --> 06:10.310
Yeah, l don't know.
Usual time, l guess.

06:10.472 --> 06:12.110
Fine, yeah. No, it sounds great.

06:12.272 --> 06:14.103
Okay.

06:15.592 --> 06:18.345
- What did she want, Norm?
- ''What did she want, Norm?''

06:18.512 --> 06:20.582
What she wanted was, she wanted
me to come home early.

06:20.752 --> 06:23.266
She's making a turkey dinner,
all right?

06:23.432 --> 06:27.266
And then she paused
and said there'd be no dressing.

06:28.272 --> 06:29.944
Do you...

06:30.512 --> 06:33.345
...suppose she meant the bird or us?

06:34.672 --> 06:38.824
Either way, there's gonna be some
plump, succulent thighs at that table.

06:50.032 --> 06:51.351
- Hi, Miss Chambers.
- Hi, Woody.

06:51.512 --> 06:54.106
- l thought you left.
- No, no, l'm waiting for Sam.

06:54.272 --> 06:55.546
l have a call to make.

06:55.752 --> 06:58.141
Well, he's up in the restaurant.
l can go get him if you want.

06:58.312 --> 07:00.780
l mean, he's probably just eating
or something.

07:01.552 --> 07:03.349
No, that's okay. Thank you.

07:03.552 --> 07:05.622
l have calls to make.

07:07.192 --> 07:11.231
Actually, Woody, l'm not really
in here to make phone calls.

07:11.392 --> 07:15.067
l came back to apologize to Sam.

07:15.232 --> 07:17.792
l loathe to admit that l...

07:17.952 --> 07:21.228
...eavesdropped on a conversation
he had with Janet the other day,

07:21.392 --> 07:23.587
and that's inexcusable.

07:24.632 --> 07:28.102
My conscience was bothering me,
so l came back to confess.

07:29.392 --> 07:33.226
Thus allowing me to close
this chapter in my life.

07:33.632 --> 07:35.190
Okey-dokey.

07:37.232 --> 07:39.302
Woody? Woody?

07:39.832 --> 07:40.947
May l ask you a question?

07:41.592 --> 07:45.221
Sure, if you're not fussy
about the answer.

07:47.752 --> 07:51.950
Has Sam ever talked to you about
his feelings toward Miss Eldridge?

07:52.152 --> 07:53.824
Well...

07:53.992 --> 07:56.665
...l heard him say that he kind
of likes her.

07:56.832 --> 08:00.507
But in my opinion, you and Sam
make a much better couple.

08:05.592 --> 08:07.867
- Really?
- Yeah.

08:08.632 --> 08:10.862
You're my two favourite people
in the whole world.

08:11.632 --> 08:13.748
Oh, Woody.

08:16.152 --> 08:17.790
Thank you.

08:17.952 --> 08:19.908
Except for my parents.

08:21.152 --> 08:23.746
- l know.
- And my teachers at school.

08:24.992 --> 08:27.665
Oh, wait a minute. l can put you
ahead of my 8th grade teacher,

08:27.832 --> 08:29.185
Mr Thorndike.

08:29.352 --> 08:33.630
He always had chalk on his suit
and he smelled kind of funny.

08:33.792 --> 08:36.067
But, you know, l don't wanna hurt
Mr Thorndike's feelings,

08:36.232 --> 08:38.587
so let's just forget this conversation.

08:38.751 --> 08:40.822
l was planning to, Woody.

08:41.751 --> 08:42.866
- Hey, Sam.
- Hey, Woody.

08:43.032 --> 08:48.425
Could we go into your office? l need
to talk to you about a personal matter.

08:56.432 --> 08:58.150
Sam, this is serious.

08:58.352 --> 08:59.910
So is this.

09:01.112 --> 09:03.865
We have this press conference
today, and l just want you to know

09:04.032 --> 09:06.671
that it's becoming increasingly difficult
for me to answer questions

09:06.832 --> 09:09.392
- about what our future plans are.
- Why?

09:09.552 --> 09:12.112
Because l don't know
what our future plans are.

09:14.032 --> 09:15.511
Wait, wait, what are you saying?

09:16.272 --> 09:19.503
Well, this may sound
a little old-fashioned,

09:19.672 --> 09:22.311
but l guess l'm asking
what your intentions are toward me.

09:23.192 --> 09:24.307
lntentions?

09:24.832 --> 09:29.462
Well, l mean, haven't you ever thought
about you and me tying the knot?

09:29.672 --> 09:32.630
Oh, now, you told me you didn't
go in for that kinky stuff.

09:37.232 --> 09:39.871
Okay. All right, all right.

09:40.232 --> 09:42.063
Well, do you...?

09:43.512 --> 09:44.661
You see, you see...

09:44.832 --> 09:50.031
You and l really have never even
talked about, you know--

09:50.192 --> 09:51.989
- The word is marriage, Sam.
- Yeah.

09:52.152 --> 09:53.380
lt won't bite you.

09:53.552 --> 09:56.146
Reporters are bound to ask about us
at the press conference today.

09:56.312 --> 09:58.143
l don't know what we're
gonna tell them. Do you?

09:58.312 --> 10:00.143
Well...

10:00.312 --> 10:01.427
...gee, l-- l don't--

10:01.632 --> 10:04.385
- l don't know that--
- Oh, take it easy, Sam.

10:04.552 --> 10:06.383
- What?
- l'm not trying to trap you.

10:06.552 --> 10:09.112
Oh, are you kidding?
l don't feel trapped.

10:09.312 --> 10:11.906
Excuse me. Let me, let me just...

10:13.152 --> 10:15.063
l'm not putting any pressure
on you, darling.

10:15.272 --> 10:17.740
l know a man like you hates
that kind of thing from a woman.

10:17.952 --> 10:20.227
lt's just in my profession,
l have to take things seriously

10:20.392 --> 10:22.189
because l'm in the public eye.

10:22.352 --> 10:24.912
lt'd be different if l worked
in a supermarket or something.

10:27.592 --> 10:31.141
All l'm saying is that it's something
we have to think about.

10:31.352 --> 10:34.230
We can't go on indefinitely
like we have been.

10:34.432 --> 10:37.981
Not that l have any complaints
about what we have been.

10:38.152 --> 10:40.188
Okay, l'll give it some thought.
l will. l promise.

10:40.392 --> 10:42.383
Good. l'll see you later.

10:42.592 --> 10:44.184
Okay.

10:47.392 --> 10:48.950
- Sam?
- Yeah, what?

10:49.112 --> 10:51.182
l just wanted to remind you again.

10:51.352 --> 10:53.104
When are you gonna replace
Miss Chambers?

10:53.312 --> 10:55.701
- You haven't put an ad in the paper.
- l'll get to it, Woody.

10:55.872 --> 10:57.430
Well, you keep saying that.

10:57.632 --> 11:02.148
- Would you stop bugging me, please?
- Okay, Sam. Sorry.

11:05.072 --> 11:06.710
By the way...

11:07.872 --> 11:10.102
...where is Miss Chambers?

11:10.272 --> 11:12.661
Hey, how should l know
where she is, Wood?

11:12.832 --> 11:14.185
Give me a break, will you?

11:14.352 --> 11:16.149
She came in here to wait.

11:16.312 --> 11:18.587
- She what?
- Yeah.

11:22.752 --> 11:25.220
Wait on...

11:25.392 --> 11:29.829
...tables here at Cheers,
and you fired her.

11:29.992 --> 11:32.028
And you know the rest.

11:34.592 --> 11:37.425
Thank you for the recap, Woody.

11:43.192 --> 11:44.466
Miss Chambers?

11:46.032 --> 11:48.592
l covered for your eavesdropping
this time, but you know,

11:48.752 --> 11:50.470
l think you have a real problem.

11:55.272 --> 11:56.864
l think you ought to get some help.

11:58.312 --> 12:01.110
l will, Woody. l promise.

12:01.272 --> 12:03.103
Do me one favour, will you?

12:03.272 --> 12:06.582
Please, just tell me when Sam steps
into the men's room.

12:11.072 --> 12:13.632
Oh, God, it's worse than l imagined.

12:26.072 --> 12:27.551
l can't believe this.

12:28.232 --> 12:31.349
Cameras, reporters,
government officials.

12:32.032 --> 12:35.388
And to think, only a few short months
ago, l was back in lndiana

12:35.552 --> 12:37.622
pumping suds for a bunch of bozos.

12:37.832 --> 12:39.788
Hey, goober, how about pouring us
another round?

12:39.992 --> 12:41.948
Coming right up.

12:42.512 --> 12:44.901
Hey, Woody, give us a couple of beers,
will you?

12:45.112 --> 12:47.626
- Hey, where you guys been?
- Normie took me to meet Donna,

12:47.792 --> 12:49.145
the alleged Lolita.

12:49.312 --> 12:52.543
Yeah, maybe she's not quite as bad
as l made her out to be.

12:52.712 --> 12:54.668
Are you kidding?
She's the sweetest, most innocent

12:54.832 --> 12:57.062
freckle-faced youngster
l ever wanted to meet.

12:57.232 --> 12:59.348
And for you to imply she was
unwholesome and behaved

12:59.512 --> 13:02.868
in a salacious manner towards
you is unbelievable.

13:03.032 --> 13:06.308
Well, maybe my imagination's
a little overactive, l guess.

13:06.512 --> 13:09.902
Especially if you think that
that young lady is coming on to you.

13:10.072 --> 13:12.984
She's coming on to me
like gangbusters.

13:14.232 --> 13:17.747
Cliffie, you know, you're really kind of
a handy guy to have around.

13:17.912 --> 13:20.062
Just when l think l've gone
completely off the deep end,

13:20.232 --> 13:25.181
l look over at you, and there you are
diving off the cliffs at Acapulco.

13:26.192 --> 13:30.026
Yeah, but looking mucho primo
in my bikini briefs, eh?

13:33.552 --> 13:34.826
Excuse me.

13:35.832 --> 13:40.030
Well, if it isn't Rebecca
of Skinnybrook Farm.

13:40.792 --> 13:43.465
Shouldn't you be out collecting
shopping carts?

13:45.232 --> 13:50.670
Well, l was in the neighbourhood,
and l thought l'd drop by and unwind.

13:50.832 --> 13:53.869
Sure. lt just happens to be

13:54.032 --> 13:57.263
five minutes before Sam and Janet's
press conference.

13:57.912 --> 14:00.631
Oh, is that today?

14:00.792 --> 14:03.101
Mercy. Well, l'm a concerned citizen.

14:03.272 --> 14:05.422
Perhaps l'll just stick around
and see what happens.

14:05.632 --> 14:08.021
Okay, l think we're ready now.

14:10.272 --> 14:12.991
- Well, Sam, we're on.
- Wait a-- Wait a minute.

14:13.632 --> 14:14.860
l don't know about this tie.

14:15.032 --> 14:17.102
Come on. When have you ever
not looked fabulous?

14:17.272 --> 14:19.467
Oh, yeah, right. Right.

14:19.632 --> 14:21.270
Shows you how nervous l am, huh?

14:21.432 --> 14:23.662
- You'll be just fine.
- Yeah. Thanks.

14:24.872 --> 14:26.385
Good day, ladies and gentlemen.

14:26.752 --> 14:29.824
We hold so many of our press
conferences in my stuffy old office,

14:29.992 --> 14:31.903
l thought it would be nice to show
you reporters

14:32.072 --> 14:33.664
what the inside of a bar
looks like.

14:34.472 --> 14:37.384
There won't be any opening statement
today. l'll just take your questions.

14:38.032 --> 14:41.707
Councillor Eldridge, what's your priority
in your next two years of office?

14:41.912 --> 14:43.391
You must be new in town.

14:44.032 --> 14:45.101
Mass transit.

14:45.312 --> 14:49.590
l'll see to it that Boston has the finest
system in this country or die trying.

14:49.792 --> 14:52.750
Councillor, in view of your re-election
to city council,

14:52.912 --> 14:56.541
l'd like to pose a question that l'm sure
is on everybody's mind here today.

14:57.272 --> 15:00.389
How do you think the Red Sox
are gonna do this season?

15:00.592 --> 15:03.868
Why don't l turn this over to my
special consultant on this issue,

15:04.032 --> 15:05.226
Mayday Malone.

15:12.472 --> 15:17.068
Whether the Red Sox
do well or not is not the point.

15:17.232 --> 15:20.702
l think they're gonna bring a lot
of money into this city,

15:20.872 --> 15:26.902
and that can do nothing but help
the tax base of our fair city.

15:27.072 --> 15:30.951
ln layman's terms, the Sox are gonna
clean up this year.

15:32.632 --> 15:35.829
- l have a question.
- What? What are you--?

15:36.032 --> 15:38.341
Excuse me.
What paper do you represent?

15:39.352 --> 15:42.264
Hurley's Market Shopper's Guide.

15:46.232 --> 15:48.826
l'm afraid this is for
newspaper reporters only.

15:49.032 --> 15:52.229
Oh, l'm sorry.
l thought this was America.

15:53.672 --> 15:55.390
No, no, Phil, it's okay.

15:55.552 --> 15:58.510
- Hello again, Miss Chambers.
- Hello, and thank you.

15:58.672 --> 16:00.867
Councillor, on the less political side,

16:01.032 --> 16:03.148
there seems to be a lot of interest
in the two of you.

16:03.312 --> 16:07.908
Mr Malone, would you care to
comment on your plans for the future?

16:09.072 --> 16:11.347
l thought we'd grab a pizza,
then try to catch a movie

16:11.512 --> 16:13.503
on the tube later on.

16:14.192 --> 16:16.911
How delightful.
But let me be a little more specific.

16:17.072 --> 16:21.111
The hottest topic in town is whether
or not there are wedding bells

16:21.312 --> 16:22.950
in Sam and Janet's future.

16:23.152 --> 16:26.542
Can you confirm or deny these
rumours? Give us a scoop.

16:26.752 --> 16:28.902
l'm sure there are more important
issues to be discussed

16:29.072 --> 16:30.551
in this forum than that,
Miss Chambers.

16:30.752 --> 16:33.630
What do you have to say
about this marriage business, Sam?

16:35.672 --> 16:38.664
Oh, well, gee, l-- l don't know if--

16:38.872 --> 16:40.624
l don't think this is the time
or the place--

16:40.792 --> 16:44.501
No, wait, wait.
Actually, l'll-- l will handle this.

16:44.672 --> 16:46.230
Sweetheart.

16:47.232 --> 16:49.507
Fellas, l think we're jumping
the gun a little bit here.

16:49.672 --> 16:52.789
l mean, we've only known each other
about four months, so--

16:52.992 --> 16:55.586
Really? By my calculations,
it's only six weeks.

16:55.792 --> 16:57.191
Whatever.

16:58.072 --> 16:59.949
Perhaps it just seems longer.

17:00.152 --> 17:01.221
Next question, please.

17:01.432 --> 17:04.788
Councillor, do you agree
with Mr Malone that the relationship

17:04.952 --> 17:06.782
seems to be dragging on?

17:09.192 --> 17:11.387
Yeah, l-- l know what
you're trying to do here, Diane.

17:11.551 --> 17:12.826
How dumb do you think l am?

17:13.031 --> 17:14.909
l believe we're supposed to ask
the questions.

17:15.071 --> 17:17.222
Janet, how dumb do you think
Sam is?

17:21.031 --> 17:24.308
Could we please confine our questions
to matters of public interest, please?

17:24.472 --> 17:28.784
Councillor, how do you plan to alleviate
the overnight parking problem?

17:28.992 --> 17:30.141
The overnight parking problem,

17:30.312 --> 17:32.826
unfortunately, cannot be solved
overnight.

17:32.992 --> 17:36.223
l have, however, persuaded the city
council to hasten the formation

17:36.432 --> 17:38.548
of a fact-finding committee
for the purpose

17:38.752 --> 17:40.947
of looking into selecting sites.

17:41.152 --> 17:43.302
Of course, there are problems
to contend with, such as

17:43.512 --> 17:45.662
environmental-impact studies
and reports. Stop it!

17:45.832 --> 17:47.060
All right, that's it!

17:47.272 --> 17:48.705
You see that?
She just squirted me!

17:48.912 --> 17:51.107
- She has a little yellow squirt--
- Will you stop this?

17:51.312 --> 17:53.143
Yeah, all right. l'll stop it. l'm all right.

17:53.312 --> 17:56.384
Yeah, l'm gonna escort this woman
out of my bar forever.

17:56.592 --> 17:58.264
Very well.

17:58.432 --> 17:59.626
l'll leave.

17:59.792 --> 18:02.545
And l never want to see
your fat, ugly face again.

18:02.752 --> 18:07.667
- You're about to see my fat, ugly fist.
- l'm shaking in my boots.

18:07.832 --> 18:09.823
- My tie.
- Going up.

18:20.272 --> 18:23.867
l believe the gentleman from
The Globe had a question.

18:30.312 --> 18:32.189
Well, l certainly have to hand it
to you, Sammy.

18:32.352 --> 18:34.468
You throw one helluva
press conference.

18:35.752 --> 18:37.265
l haven't seen
such an ugly scene

18:37.432 --> 18:40.344
since my kids' school picture.

18:41.672 --> 18:43.628
l just got off the phone
with the last newspaper.

18:43.792 --> 18:45.748
l'm not sure how much damage
was done.

18:45.912 --> 18:46.901
What'd you say?

18:47.072 --> 18:49.222
l told them you took some
sinus medication

18:49.392 --> 18:50.905
and had an allergic reaction.

18:51.072 --> 18:53.063
- They buy it?
- Not unless there's something else

18:53.232 --> 18:54.984
you can put in a crock.

18:55.472 --> 18:59.067
Oh, come on. l know it was a bit
unpleasant earlier tonight,

18:59.232 --> 19:02.383
but, l mean, when you look back on it,
you can't help but laugh.

19:03.672 --> 19:06.345
Unless you try really hard.

19:06.552 --> 19:08.941
Oh, come on.
Now, there's a grin in there.

19:09.112 --> 19:10.830
Come on.
Now, that'll turn into a smile.

19:11.032 --> 19:13.592
All right, there you go.
Come on, l'm sorry.

19:13.752 --> 19:16.186
How the hell did l ever
get into this mess?

19:17.072 --> 19:20.064
l'm crazy about a guy who's
the worst thing in the world for me.

19:20.872 --> 19:22.783
We can't go on like this, Sam.

19:23.192 --> 19:24.705
You have no regard for my career.

19:24.872 --> 19:26.703
And what's worse,
you have no regard for me.

19:26.872 --> 19:28.988
You lied when you said
you had no feelings for Diane.

19:29.192 --> 19:32.628
- You obviously have strong feelings.
- No, no, come on, please. That--

19:32.832 --> 19:35.027
No, Sam, face it.

19:35.192 --> 19:39.105
You're trying to leave every option
open, and you just can't do that.

19:39.272 --> 19:43.424
You have to make some choices
and some commitments.

19:43.592 --> 19:46.231
lt's called growing up.

20:07.792 --> 20:12.149
Boy, looks like Sammy
got his walking papers.

20:12.312 --> 20:13.950
l know how he feels.

20:14.152 --> 20:15.710
l think we've all been there before.

20:15.912 --> 20:20.986
Well, it's never happened to me, so l
guess l'll just have to imagine it, huh?

20:22.312 --> 20:26.703
Cliffie, l think you actually have to go
with someone before you get dumped.

20:33.912 --> 20:35.061
Good night. Good night.

20:35.232 --> 20:36.790
See you guys later. Drive carefully.

20:38.592 --> 20:41.425
Why don't we do this tomorrow, huh?
Let's go home.

20:41.632 --> 20:44.351
No argument here. l'm beat.

20:45.552 --> 20:50.387
Boy, Sam, you had a rough day today.
You lost two great gals in one day.

20:50.832 --> 20:52.151
Two?

20:52.312 --> 20:54.951
Well, yeah, you know, l always thought
that someday Miss Chambers

20:55.112 --> 20:58.229
would be Mrs Malone.
That's crazy, huh?

20:58.392 --> 21:00.781
Well, Woody, there are more
where they came from.

21:02.472 --> 21:04.428
You know, l'm glad you said that

21:04.592 --> 21:08.028
because there's this girl in my building
l wish you could meet.

21:08.232 --> 21:11.861
She's really cute.
She's got a great personality.

21:12.032 --> 21:16.628
She's really fun to be with,
and she has got a gorgeous figure.

21:16.792 --> 21:21.183
And if l were a young single guy
in this town...

21:23.192 --> 21:25.422
See you tomorrow, Sam.

21:32.792 --> 21:37.070
- You okay?
- l don't know, Carla.

21:37.232 --> 21:40.349
l think l screwed up my life here.

21:40.512 --> 21:44.630
l mean, look at me. l'm pushing 40,
and what have l got to show for it?

21:46.672 --> 21:49.903
Maybe it's time l settle down, huh?

21:50.072 --> 21:54.031
Maybe the time's right
for Mayday to get married.

21:54.392 --> 21:56.542
The answer is yes.

21:59.232 --> 22:00.904
You didn't ask a question, did you?

22:02.312 --> 22:05.429
Listen, Sam, when the right dame
comes along, you'll know it.

22:05.632 --> 22:08.351
Well, that's what l'm afraid of.
l think she did, and l let her go.

22:08.552 --> 22:13.580
No. She didn't come along yet.
Casabas are your destiny, Sam.

22:13.752 --> 22:15.310
Hold out.

22:16.912 --> 22:19.062
- Good night.
- Good night.

22:57.752 --> 23:00.027
Hi, it's-- lt's me.

23:00.192 --> 23:01.591
Look...

23:02.392 --> 23:04.701
...l've been thinking about you.

23:05.552 --> 23:08.942
Oh, what the hell.
Will you marry me?
