47:35.775 --> 47:38.180
So, in the 1920s,
no one believed

47:38.213 --> 47:41.053
it was even possible
to make an animated feature.

47:41.086 --> 47:44.660
Took him seven years,
and then he broke all records.

47:44.693 --> 47:47.499
Years later,
when he was in his 50s,

47:47.533 --> 47:50.204
he built all these train tracks
in his home.

47:50.237 --> 47:52.041

he'd lost his mind.

47:52.074 --> 47:54.045
There was this grown man

47:54.078 --> 47:57.953
riding in and out of the
living room on a children's toy.

47:57.986 --> 48:00.158
But he was thinking
in three dimensions.

48:00.191 --> 48:03.197

-What?

that had never been done before:

48:11.714 --> 48:14.051

48:15.087 --> 48:17.091
And you feel a kinship with him.

48:18.327 --> 48:20.264
So, I bought Zoomer
a couple of hamsters

48:20.297 --> 48:21.968
and I thought
they were both male,

48:22.001 --> 48:23.638
but turns out
one of them was female.

48:23.671 --> 48:26.611
And he loved watching
the babies be born.

48:26.644 --> 48:29.049
So we started
to mate them together.

was to mate them.

leapt tech forward through play.

49:06.189 --> 49:08.194
So, after giving it
some serious thought,

49:08.227 --> 49:10.632
I really do think
it's best that you go home.

because the police didn't.

49:23.357 --> 49:25.494

49:25.528 --> 49:28.635
Because I watched Bill die
and no one's asked me anything.

49:28.668 --> 49:30.738

what would you say?

49:32.809 --> 49:35.014
That someone came to see him

49:35.047 --> 49:37.084

49:39.389 --> 49:41.561

came to Bill's room

49:50.612 --> 49:55.053

injected himself at that point.

have cameras in the room,

50:12.388 --> 50:15.729
The reason the police
didn't ask you anything

50:15.762 --> 50:18.133
is because they got everything
they needed to know

50:18.166 --> 50:19.570
