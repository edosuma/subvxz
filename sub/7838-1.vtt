00:00.500 --> 00:02.919
We now return
to Keepin' It Kodos.

00:02.919 --> 00:04.567
starring Kang!

00:06.700 --> 00:07.982
Is dinner ready yet?

00:08.339 --> 00:10.803
Our boss will be 
here any minute now.

00:16.100 --> 00:18.657
This one keeps eating himself...

00:21.562 --> 00:23.259
Octopuses!

00:23.271 --> 00:24.242
I'm done!

00:24.481 --> 00:26.789
Am I the only one here
who's in horrible pain?

00:27.242 --> 00:29.780
You're the only one
who won't shut up about it.

00:31.481 --> 00:33.021
What a delicious meal.

00:34.075 --> 00:36.445
I feel like I'm
going to burst.

00:38.200 --> 00:39.755
Cool! 
I'm vomit!

00:40.957 --> 00:45.734
Well, a fine meal like that
deserves a hyper-galactic promotion.

00:45.962 --> 00:47.597
Hyper-galactic!

00:48.088 --> 00:50.051
Wait a minute...
I don't have a family anymore.

00:50.423 --> 00:54.094
You do now, son.
You do now.

01:19.998 --> 01:21.548
Homer, what are you doing?

01:21.915 --> 01:23.260
Trying to get a Frisbee
off the roof.

01:28.296 --> 01:29.680
Ah, there's the Frisbee.

01:31.965 --> 01:33.790
Concussion... 
diddily...

01:33.802 --> 01:35.941
Hemorrhage... 
Doodily...

01:35.941 --> 01:37.799
Injury... 
Bodily...

01:38.221 --> 01:39.640
Ned, you nearly died...

01:39.641 --> 01:40.796
of a brain tumor.

01:40.808 --> 01:43.346
Thank goodness that bowling ball
knocked it out of your head.

01:44.477 --> 01:45.661
Welcome back, dawg.

01:53.861 --> 01:56.837
My, you look awfully pale.
Let's get you some fresh air.

01:57.492 --> 01:59.745
Hey, while you're there, can you
get my Frisbee off the ledge?

01:59.748 --> 02:03.268
All right, but I swear to God,
this is the very last time.

02:06.251 --> 02:07.927
Oh, man, is this going to hurt.

02:10.002 --> 02:11.479
That's better.

02:15.592 --> 02:16.685
Come on, Ned.

02:16.686 --> 02:19.907
Just because you foresaw
Dr. Hibbert's death...

02:19.911 --> 02:22.092
doesn't mean you can see
into the future.

02:22.223 --> 02:24.681
It was just a sinister
co-inky-dink.

02:24.728 --> 02:25.645
Help me!

02:25.645 --> 02:29.419
Some bullies threw my shoes 
over a telephone wire...

02:30.025 --> 02:31.817
with me in them!

02:31.818 --> 02:34.145
Just wriggle loose. I'll catch 
you, li'l critter.

02:42.912 --> 02:45.098
Oh, another setback.

02:46.500 --> 02:48.137
What the Family Circus?

02:48.138 --> 02:51.062
A second premonition
came to fruition.

02:51.062 --> 02:55.092
Lord, why have you given me
these unholy visions of doom?

03:02.348 --> 03:04.669
Well, I didn't need any special
power to know that was coming.

03:04.681 --> 03:06.573
Hey, Flanders, have
you seen my Frisbee?

03:06.978 --> 03:09.247
Homer, I can foretell
people's deaths.

03:09.247 --> 03:11.693
People's deaths, eh?

03:20.449 --> 03:21.620
Do me! Do me!

03:29.900 --> 03:32.669
So, what'd I die of?
Too much happiness?

03:32.669 --> 03:34.376
Naked girl avalanche?

03:35.548 --> 03:37.633
Uh, you die eating
a submarine sandwich.

03:37.633 --> 03:38.770
What kind of bread?

03:39.425 --> 03:40.478
Um, country parmesan.

03:42.263 --> 03:43.913
Mr. Flanders, why
are you moving?

03:44.181 --> 03:48.086
'Cause I had a vision of myself
shooting your father.

03:48.311 --> 03:49.925
In this neighborhood,
who hasn't?

03:50.145 --> 03:51.865
Well, you can't fight fate...

03:51.866 --> 03:55.389
but if you must shoot our father,
please remember our family motto :

03:55.401 --> 03:56.782
"Not in the face."

03:56.985 --> 04:00.203
Don't worry, sweetie.
I am not going to kill your father.

04:01.532 --> 04:04.698
Flanders? Kill me?

04:05.078 --> 04:08.281
You never killed anybody, and 
you're going to start with the big dog?

04:10.205 --> 04:12.179
Homer, please,
don't tempt the gods.

04:12.180 --> 04:15.848
I-I mean God. There's 
one God! Only one!

04:15.941 --> 04:17.399
Well, sometimes 
there's three.

04:17.632 --> 04:18.898
Hey, Chief, throw me your piece.

04:18.899 --> 04:20.680
Uh, sure thing, citizen.

04:23.300 --> 04:24.600
Come on. Shoot me a new one.

04:25.932 --> 04:27.336
Ooh, I'm so scared!

04:27.684 --> 04:30.447
Ned Flanders is pointing
a gun at me.

04:30.500 --> 04:32.372
You couldn't even 
shoot me by accident.

04:32.374 --> 04:34.002
even if I whacked 
the barrel like this.

04:38.161 --> 04:39.459
Quit whacking my barrel!

04:39.461 --> 04:40.233
Never!

04:42.031 --> 04:43.233
You leave me no choice!

04:49.372 --> 04:50.608
I was supposed to shoot you...

04:50.608 --> 04:53.000
but I didn't!
I changed the future!

05:01.175 --> 05:02.430
What have I done?

05:02.430 --> 05:04.427
I've changed the future
for the worse.

05:04.762 --> 05:07.954
Homer, stay away 
from the nuclear plant.

05:07.973 --> 05:09.321
Fine, I'll never go back...

05:09.322 --> 05:10.418
starting tomorrow.

05:10.435 --> 05:13.185
Today is Lenny's birthday, and 
they're having ice cream cake.

05:13.187 --> 05:14.632
But-but you're going
to kill us all!

05:14.980 --> 05:16.795
But ice cream cake!

05:21.665 --> 05:24.692
I got to find Homer. He's going 
to blow up the whole town!

05:24.699 --> 05:27.889
Yeah, well, you know, you got 
to take the bitter with the sweet.

05:35.334 --> 05:38.137
Homer, do not press the 
core destruct button!

05:38.588 --> 05:40.843
Press... destruct button.

05:46.052 --> 05:48.528
Don't do it! Don't do it!
You'll kill everyone!

05:48.531 --> 05:51.747
Do it... do it!
Kill everyone!

05:51.935 --> 05:55.237
Sure is taking me a long time
to reach this button.

05:59.776 --> 06:00.586
Must...

06:01.235 --> 06:02.317
...kill...

06:02.600 --> 06:03.600
...best friend.

06:07.783 --> 06:09.415
Homer, fall backward!

06:27.177 --> 06:29.028
Oh, you stupid son of a...

06:35.228 --> 06:36.915
Homer, I'm so mad at you!

06:36.915 --> 06:41.244
I'll bet you blew up the town
just to get out of cleaning the garage.

06:43.387 --> 06:45.237
Everything's coming up Homer.

06:45.237 --> 06:47.372
Yeah, well, the joke's 
on you, smart guy.

06:47.374 --> 06:49.879
The garage made it to Heaven, too.

06:52.995 --> 06:56.163
Hmm, I wonder if I 
could blow up Heaven?

06:56.165 --> 07:00.514
Homer Simpson, it's time
you got what's coming to you.

07:01.449 --> 07:02.670
Your Frisbee.

07:03.548 --> 07:05.584
Cool. You guys got
a good buffet up here?

07:05.591 --> 07:10.153
Oh, yeah. Just stay away
from the three-bean salad.

07:10.153 --> 07:11.980
You're not the boss of me.

07:25.000 --> 07:25.939
Hello, ducky.

07:33.384 --> 07:35.636
You gave me quite a fright, you did.

07:35.649 --> 07:40.391
Say, you don't need no fancy 
knife to get me attention...

07:40.394 --> 07:42.920
not with those handsome muttonchops.

07:42.920 --> 07:45.096
Come on. 
Give us a snog.

07:46.591 --> 07:48.687
That's not a snog!

07:54.723 --> 07:57.843
Looks like the Muttonchop
Murderer has struck again.

07:58.144 --> 07:59.562
What should we do with the body?

07:59.562 --> 08:01.382
I want you to dust
her for prints.

08:01.564 --> 08:02.319
What does that mean?

08:02.321 --> 08:05.003
The Prince is coming by...

08:05.003 --> 08:07.127
and I want her clean 
when he looks her over.

08:07.187 --> 08:09.761
Perhaps we can be of 
assistance, Inspector.

08:09.862 --> 08:12.165
Well, well, well,
look who's here.

08:12.165 --> 08:17.163
Master detective Eliza Simpson 
and her easily amazed sidekick :

08:17.163 --> 08:18.201
Dr. Bartley.

08:18.622 --> 08:21.689
What's this? A doorknob.
Good show.

08:22.043 --> 08:24.627
So, what clues has the body shewn?

08:25.379 --> 08:28.490
We don't need clues. We've 
already caught the killer.

08:30.759 --> 08:34.839
This mysterious Hindu is clearly 
responsible for the murder.

08:35.014 --> 08:37.075
Lock him up till we 
find someone darker, boys.

08:37.892 --> 08:38.682
Please, I am not a killer.

08:38.682 --> 08:42.173
I am but a humble purveyor 
of disgusting British food.

08:43.340 --> 08:44.908
Lark tongues, head pudding,

08:44.908 --> 08:46.177
eel pies.

08:46.399 --> 08:48.552
Eel pie?
My favorite.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.873
We British sure eat crap.

08:53.490 --> 08:56.224
Inspector, might I 
have a word wit' you?

08:56.576 --> 08:57.450
Absolutely

08:59.330 --> 09:01.274
Get back down there, you.

09:03.710 --> 09:06.143
- You were saying?
- Well, it's like this.

09:06.144 --> 09:08.653
I'm a proper Cockney
flower girl, I am,

09:08.658 --> 09:10.793
and I sees this 
real strange bloke.

09:10.798 --> 09:14.129
Out of sorts. Mad in the eyes.
All kettles and biscuits.

09:14.177 --> 09:15.903
Well, he seen I was lookin' at him,

09:15.903 --> 09:19.595
and he drops this and runs. 
Cor, blimey, skip to me loo.

09:19.893 --> 09:20.902
Good Lord!

09:21.811 --> 09:25.259
I'm afraid this case is beyond 
even your powers, little girl.

09:25.273 --> 09:27.375
I'll take that 
challenge, Inspector.

09:27.375 --> 09:28.860
Yeah, well, good luck.

09:28.860 --> 09:32.777
Uh, now, boys, let's see the 
suspect in that child abduction case.

09:32.778 --> 09:34.764
I shall never grow up.

09:34.783 --> 09:36.187
Uh, in jail you will.

09:37.701 --> 09:39.336
Yes, I recognize this blade.

09:39.339 --> 09:41.287
I sold it as part of a set...

09:41.288 --> 09:43.903
the famed Seven Swords of Osiris.

09:44.125 --> 09:46.721
Now would you be interested
in an illustrated novelette?

09:46.750 --> 09:49.850
It also includes a "Young 
David Diligent" adventure.

09:50.090 --> 09:54.153
Confound it, man! I need to 
know who bought those swords!

09:54.509 --> 09:57.080
Very well.
I will check my records.

09:57.514 --> 10:00.557
You may examine my curios,
but do not touch my oddities.

10:00.850 --> 10:02.975
Use your judgment with my gewgaws.

10:04.144 --> 10:05.692
Well, I'll be blazed.

10:05.700 --> 10:07.330
I know these missionaries.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.532
I just told the natives they
were having sex the wrong way.

10:10.860 --> 10:12.826
Help! Help! 
Murder!

10:15.691 --> 10:18.004
The Muttonchop Murderer 
is long gone.

10:18.201 --> 10:20.668
But this ledger
will lead us to him.

10:22.330 --> 10:24.965
This potion will give me new life.

10:29.613 --> 10:31.839
I'm alive.
I'm gonna go to America.

10:31.840 --> 10:33.649
I'll be in pictures.
You'll see.

10:33.649 --> 10:36.971
The whole world is gonna know
the name Simon Stoolowitz.

10:45.562 --> 10:49.763
It says here the swords were 
sold to C. Ebenezer Burns.

10:50.191 --> 10:54.038
Burns? The evil industrialist
who makes coal out of babies?

10:54.821 --> 10:56.312
I know just where to find him.

11:03.620 --> 11:05.514
Ebenezer Burns? 
Yeah, he's over here.

11:06.624 --> 11:07.894
How ya doin', there?
Fresh'n your pipe?

11:07.894 --> 11:09.721
Anybody need a let-me-down?

11:09.724 --> 11:13.552
Whoa, whoa, heads up there, buddy.
A rat's gnawin' off your toe.

11:18.134 --> 11:20.123
The Sword of Osiris...

11:20.138 --> 11:22.375
I once possessed 
the entire collection...

11:22.389 --> 11:24.620
Then I sold them all for opium.

11:24.620 --> 11:26.163
Oh, how I wish
I had them back...

11:26.168 --> 11:27.769
to sell for more opium!

11:27.772 --> 11:29.456
Who did you sell the swords to?

11:29.647 --> 11:31.596
A fat man with sideburns...

11:31.596 --> 11:33.610
like that one over there.

11:35.945 --> 11:37.701
There's your Muttonchop Murderer!

11:37.864 --> 11:39.081
Stop, fiend!

11:48.400 --> 11:50.198
Opium rules!

11:51.200 --> 11:53.129
Hey, hey. Read the sign.

11:54.964 --> 11:56.360
Well, well,
what have we here?

11:56.360 --> 11:58.331
Inspector, you've
caught the villain!

11:58.341 --> 12:00.801
But what are you doing
in an opium den?

12:00.802 --> 12:03.312
It's the only way I can
get Ralphie to go to sleep.

12:03.514 --> 12:05.908
I can make opi-ohs!

12:08.350 --> 12:12.028
Well, Dr. Bartley, another
mystery well solved.

12:12.028 --> 12:14.004
Yes, with the murderer
behind bars...

12:14.024 --> 12:18.095
London's working girls are free 
to follow their merry calling.

12:20.298 --> 12:22.894
Yet another Sword of Osiris!

12:22.897 --> 12:27.272
But that must mean...
the murderer is still at large.

12:27.538 --> 12:29.927
Ah, he could have killed
this one days ago.

12:29.927 --> 12:32.605
The body is bloated,
and the face is rotten.

12:32.668 --> 12:36.167
It was five minutes
ago, you twit.

12:47.307 --> 12:49.899
I'm not a murderer. I'm not.

12:49.899 --> 12:53.201
And I've never known
the pleasures of a woman...

12:53.605 --> 12:55.759
or a proper eating apple.

12:55.798 --> 12:57.168
Quiet, you.

12:58.653 --> 13:01.230
There's cheese in my eel pie.

13:01.239 --> 13:04.032
This week, in our 
Summer Hanging Series,

13:04.033 --> 13:06.642
we're pleased to present
the Muttonchop Murderer.

13:06.658 --> 13:09.245
At last God-fearing Londoners...

13:09.245 --> 13:12.000
are free to walk Whore Alley.

13:14.668 --> 13:16.596
Stay your hand, Inspector.

13:16.879 --> 13:18.384
That man is innocent!

13:18.384 --> 13:20.432
The murderer's blade
is covered with blood,

13:20.436 --> 13:22.538
but the handle is covered
with something else:

13:22.677 --> 13:26.047
the unmistakable 
fragrance of eel pie.

13:26.700 --> 13:28.841
Hey, lots of people
like eel pie.

13:28.850 --> 13:31.432
Yeah? Well, how many
of them have muttonchops?

13:33.298 --> 13:35.210
Why can't you be
more like Eddie?

13:35.211 --> 13:37.105
He never says a
word against me.

13:37.105 --> 13:38.769
That's 'cause
you cut out his tongue.

13:40.278 --> 13:43.865
you were the most famous 
member of Scotland Yard.

13:43.865 --> 13:45.370
Why would you do this?

13:46.158 --> 13:46.979
Well, the fact is,

13:46.993 --> 13:50.373
I wanted to come up with a case
even you couldn't solve.

13:50.374 --> 13:53.898
And besides...
so long, you stupid British twits!

13:57.629 --> 13:58.921
You'll never catch me.

13:58.922 --> 14:01.432
I'm traveling
at the speed of wind.

14:03.802 --> 14:07.514
Remember me for my police work
and not the murders!

14:09.774 --> 14:12.504
Well done. 
Their fleet is destroyed.

14:18.649 --> 14:21.052
Daddy, I had the craziest dream.

14:21.067 --> 14:24.364
Ralphie, you're still in it.

14:43.692 --> 14:46.864
I have a serious brain disease.
Please give me a cat.

14:50.056 --> 14:53.716
This comically large 
capsule has lifetime supplies

14:53.725 --> 14:58.028
of niacin, thiamin
and riboflavin-glavin.

15:07.072 --> 15:09.596
Prior to ingestion,
the pill must be reduced...

15:09.596 --> 15:12.475
by my amazing
new shrink ray.

15:12.798 --> 15:16.831
Shrink ray? Oh, there's 
always something else to buy.

15:16.916 --> 15:19.673
First I lower the capsule top,

15:22.379 --> 15:25.142
Then I zap the capsule,

15:29.346 --> 15:32.500
And now, who would like
a lifetime of perfect health?

15:32.514 --> 15:33.504
I'll take it.

15:33.514 --> 15:35.182
No, no that's now...
well, all right.

15:39.437 --> 15:40.740
That sounds like Maggie.

15:40.740 --> 15:42.436
But she's right here...

15:44.567 --> 15:46.320
Now, now don't worry, my dear woman.

15:46.321 --> 15:50.293
She will be rocked gently 
to sleep by the stomach acid.

15:53.745 --> 15:55.850
Hold on, Maggie! 
Daddy's coming!

15:58.908 --> 16:00.274
I've got her!

16:02.302 --> 16:03.846
No, wait. This is yours.

16:05.000 --> 16:09.221
Your daughter has 30 minutes 
before the acid dissolves the capsule.

16:09.224 --> 16:11.259
But we can rescue her...

16:11.259 --> 16:13.754
by sending a 
miniaturized vessel...

16:13.758 --> 16:16.043
through Mr. Burns' body.

16:16.057 --> 16:18.889
Ooh, stop that! The felt is 
slicing through me like a knife.

16:18.899 --> 16:20.879
Bionauts assemble!

16:21.398 --> 16:23.274
- Captain!
- Science Officer!

16:23.274 --> 16:25.500
- Security!
- Marge!

16:25.567 --> 16:28.889
Now, I insist you take off
your shoes when you get inside.

16:28.903 --> 16:32.798
And, uh, while you're in there,
grab as much cancer as you can.

16:34.570 --> 16:37.427
Let the commencement beginulate!

16:49.091 --> 16:51.865
Now, you must enter 
the subclavian vein.

16:51.865 --> 16:54.653
Screw you, doc!
I fly from the gut.

16:56.307 --> 16:57.923
Dad, you should listen to him.

16:57.932 --> 17:01.094
He's a man of science
and you can barely read.

17:01.855 --> 17:03.595
Has science ever kissed a woman?

17:03.596 --> 17:06.515
or won the Super Bowl?
or put a man on the moon?

17:07.027 --> 17:10.584
This is what I think 
of your precious science...

17:13.575 --> 17:14.913
Help me, science!

17:20.538 --> 17:23.509
Your ship is wedged in Mr. Burns' heart.

17:23.510 --> 17:26.188
And you must dislodge 
it from outside.

17:26.296 --> 17:28.798
But watch out for retroviruses.

17:28.798 --> 17:31.496
Oh, boy, are they retro!

17:31.509 --> 17:37.314
It's a fun design by R. Crumb,
who was friends with Harvey Pekar.

17:37.721 --> 17:39.557
Seriously though, 
touch one and you're dead.

17:44.814 --> 17:47.372
Why is my swimsuit so revealing?

17:47.373 --> 17:50.192
Marge, that's what 
turns a mediocre voyage...

17:50.192 --> 17:53.000
into a fantastic voyage!

17:55.280 --> 17:56.134
Maybe this'll help.

17:56.134 --> 17:57.721
Where'd you get that rib?

17:57.741 --> 18:00.509
There's a whole rack of 'em 
over there. I only ate two.

18:04.375 --> 18:05.450
Bart, what are you doing?

18:05.460 --> 18:06.548
Takin' a whiz.

18:06.553 --> 18:08.000
Stop that!

18:08.001 --> 18:09.990
We're guests in Mr. Burns.

18:10.507 --> 18:13.923
To get to Maggie in time, we'll have 
to catch a ride on a nerve impulse.

18:14.009 --> 18:16.755
the body's information superhighway.

18:16.759 --> 18:17.979
Learning is cool!

18:19.015 --> 18:21.269
And to make sure we 
get there super fast...

18:21.269 --> 18:23.769
I'm hitting all the 
buttons with my palm.

18:31.817 --> 18:33.654
Well, that hurt like hell.

18:42.538 --> 18:45.101
My sweet, undigested baby!

18:49.586 --> 18:52.923
I'm afraid I have some 
bad news, uh, Simpsons.

18:52.928 --> 18:57.375
With the baby's extra weight, you 
don't have enough power to make it back.

18:57.384 --> 19:00.721
and one of you must stay
behind to save the rest.

19:00.798 --> 19:02.153
Frink out.

19:02.153 --> 19:06.125
Oh, my God! This is the worst 
Halloween Horror we've ever faced.

19:06.144 --> 19:09.000
And white blood cells 
are attacking my clothes!

19:09.021 --> 19:11.663
Although I must admit, 
they know where to stop.

19:11.776 --> 19:15.361
We'll have to lighten the ship, which 
means one of us has to stay behind.

19:18.405 --> 19:19.392
Fine, me.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.449
Don't worry. We'll be fine!

19:22.701 --> 19:25.153
I'm saying good-bye to 
everything I ever loved.

19:25.153 --> 19:26.769
Ooh, a marshmallow!

19:28.500 --> 19:31.565
Boy, when God closes a door, He opens a window.

19:38.845 --> 19:41.765
Mom, did you have to fly out
through all those boogers?

19:41.766 --> 19:44.813
Cut me some slack. 
I'm a widow.

19:45.057 --> 19:50.039
Now, there is still a slight chance we 
could rescue your husband before he expands.

19:55.737 --> 19:57.336
Uh, make that zero chance.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.432
Frink out.

20:01.326 --> 20:03.873
Dad, would you like some of my Snicker-bar cheesecake?

20:03.874 --> 20:06.048
Oh, I feel full 
enough as it is.

20:06.048 --> 20:08.288
I say when we're full!

20:08.288 --> 20:10.874
You don't wanna piss off a man 
who can kick you in the crotch...

20:10.875 --> 20:12.009
from the inside!

20:15.750 --> 20:17.192
Oh, I need a mouth hole.

20:17.476 --> 20:20.000
Um... and some 
other holes, too.

20:20.095 --> 20:24.842
Cheer up, my chubby inner child.
I've got a feeling everything's 
going to work out fine

20:25.141 --> 20:25.961
because...

20:26.267 --> 20:29.842
"I've got you..." 

20:29.854 --> 20:32.528
"Under my skin!"

20:32.941 --> 20:38.220
"I've got you Deep in the heart of me!"

20:40.153 --> 20:46.525
"So deep in my heart,
you're really a part of me."

20:46.538 --> 20:49.413
"I've got you..."

20:49.413 --> 20:52.701
"under my skin!"
