23:08.256 --> 23:11.999
ODELAY, LOOK WHO'S BACK
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

23:12.129 --> 23:13.566
-WE'RE HERE TO SEE HECTOR.

23:13.696 --> 23:15.394
-HEY, WELL, HECTOR
DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU.

23:17.047 --> 23:18.048
-IS THAT TRUE, HECTOR?

23:19.876 --> 23:22.705
-LOOK, GO BACK TO MALIBU
AND LEAVE ME ALONE.

23:22.836 --> 23:25.839
-YOU'D RATHER STAY HERE ON
A CAR SEAT IN AN EMPTY LOT?

23:25.969 --> 23:27.710
-I GOT NO PLACE BETTER TO GO.

23:27.841 --> 23:30.583
-COME WITH US,
HECTOR. COME ON, MIJO.

23:30.713 --> 23:33.281
-I SAID HECTOR AIN'T GOING
NOWHERE WITH YOU, PUTA!

23:37.503 --> 23:39.418
-OH, WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO, SHOOT ME?

23:39.548 --> 23:41.245
YOU DESERVED TO BE
SLAPPED FOR WHAT YOU SAID.

23:41.376 --> 23:43.944
-NO, I AIN'T GONNA SHOOT YOU!

23:44.074 --> 23:46.076
I'M GONNA SHOOT
YOUR ANGELITO HERE.

23:48.557 --> 23:50.472
WHAT, ESE? WHAT!

23:57.174 --> 23:58.698
SO WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO, VIEJA?

23:58.828 --> 24:00.874
YOU'LL WATCH WHILE I BUST
A CAP IN YOUR ANGELITO?

24:01.004 --> 24:02.310
-OH, IT'S SO EASY
FOR YOU, RIGHT?

24:02.441 --> 24:04.225
YOU JUST POINT, SHOOT AND KILL.

24:04.355 --> 24:06.401
YOU KNOW, THAT'S NOT THE WAY
A MAN TAKES CARE OF BUSINESS.

24:06.532 --> 24:07.794
BE A MAN, PUT THAT GUN DOWN!

24:08.708 --> 24:10.361
-IT'S ALL RIGHT, PULGA!
-SHUT UP!

24:10.492 --> 24:12.276
-LET ME TALK TO THEM.
-NO!

24:14.844 --> 24:17.151
-I'LL BE BACK.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

24:17.847 --> 24:20.937
GET OUT OF HERE. GO HOME
BEFORE HE KILLS YOU.

HE'S CRAZY. ESTA LOCO.

24:27.683 --> 24:29.076
-THEN WHY, MAN?

24:29.206 --> 24:30.730
WHY DO YOU WANT TO HANG
OUT HERE WITH THEM?

24:30.860 --> 24:32.514
-BECAUSE HE'S MY HOMEBOY.

24:32.645 --> 24:33.863
HE'S LIKE MY BROTHER.

24:37.084 --> 24:38.433
HE'S ALL I HAVE.

24:38.564 --> 24:40.217
-NO, HECTOR, HE'S
NOT ALL YOU HAVE.

24:40.348 --> 24:41.784
YOU HAVE OTHER CHOICES.

24:41.915 --> 24:44.004
-YEAH, YOU DO, MAYBE.

24:44.744 --> 24:45.788
AND HIM.

24:48.182 --> 24:49.270
BUT NOT ME.

-NEELY: IT'S NOT A
THEORY, IT'S A FACT.

-IF THEY WERE IN LOVE,
MITCH WOULD BE HELPING HER

THERE'D BE GLANCES.

25:26.133 --> 25:28.178
-NEELY: EXACTLY, THEY'RE
PLAYING THAT SCENE OUT

-HEY.

26:01.777 --> 26:03.692
-SO WHAT'S NEW?
-AH, NOTHING MUCH.

26:03.823 --> 26:05.607
LET'S SEE, HOBIE'S COMING
INTO TOWN TOMORROW.

26:05.738 --> 26:08.044
IT'S HIS BIRTHDAY.
I GOT HIM A CAR.

26:08.175 --> 26:09.785
-A CAR? ALRIGHT, WHAT KIND?

26:09.916 --> 26:11.700
-I DON'T KNOW YET, SAM'S
TAKING ME TO A POLICE AUCTION.

26:12.396 --> 26:14.442
-YOU AND SAM BEEN SEEING A
LOT OF EACH OTHER LATELY, HUH?

26:14.573 --> 26:15.574
-NOT REALLY.

26:16.749 --> 26:18.141
-ANYTHING GOING
ON BETWEEN YOU TWO?

26:18.272 --> 26:21.144
-YEAH, SURE. WE WORK
TOGETHER, WE'RE FRIENDS.

26:24.583 --> 26:26.497
-MITCH, I'VE ALWAYS BEEN
UPFRONT WITH YOU, RIGHT?

26:26.628 --> 26:27.760
-RIGHT.

26:27.890 --> 26:30.197
-SO, YOU CAN BE
UPFRONT WITH ME.

26:30.806 --> 26:33.026
YOU AND SAM, ARE
YOU TOGETHER OR NOT?

26:33.809 --> 26:34.854
-DEFINE "TOGETHER."

26:35.855 --> 26:36.899
-ARE YOU IN LOVE?

26:39.859 --> 26:41.208
-I THINK SO.

26:41.904 --> 26:43.558
-NEELY WAS RIGHT.
-NO SHE'S NOT RIGHT.

26:43.689 --> 26:44.951
I MEAN, I DON'T
KNOW IF SHE'S RIGHT.

26:45.081 --> 26:47.388
LOOK, MAYBE SHE IS,
MAYBE SHE'S NOT,

26:47.518 --> 26:49.259
BUT WE'RE NOT EVEN SURE YET.

26:49.390 --> 26:51.305
-WHAT HAPPENED?
I MEAN, HOW'D YOU TWO...?

26:52.088 --> 26:55.657
-WELL, THE WHOLE THING
STARTED A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO

26:55.788 --> 26:57.224
ON A STRAND IN VENICE.

26:58.617 --> 27:00.923
THERE WERE REPORTS OF
PICKPOCKETING AND SOME MUGGINGS.

27:01.054 --> 27:03.926
WE SAW SOME GUY GRAB A LADY'S
PURSE AND TAKE OFF RUNNING,

27:04.057 --> 27:07.756
SO I TOOK OFF AFTER HIM,
SAM WAS RIGHT BEHIND ME.

27:09.628 --> 27:11.630
HE HEADED TOWARD ALL
THE FORTUNE TELLERS

27:11.760 --> 27:12.979
NEAR THE PAVILION.

27:13.109 --> 27:14.415
I CAUGHT UP WITH HIM FIRST.

27:14.545 --> 27:18.811
HE SWUNG THE PURSE
AT ME, I HIT HIM,

27:18.941 --> 27:22.205
AND THEN SAM TACKLED US
BOTH LIKE A LINEBACKER.

27:22.336 --> 27:25.644
WE ALL WENT FLYING INTO
A TABLE WITH TAROT CARDS

27:25.774 --> 27:26.993
AND A CRYSTAL BALL.

27:27.123 --> 27:28.821
THE MUGGER
WAS KNOCKED OUT COLD,

27:28.951 --> 27:32.520
THE CRYSTAL BALL
LANDED ON MY STOMACH.

27:32.651 --> 27:34.870
IT ACTUALLY TOOK MY BREATH AWAY.

27:35.001 --> 27:40.310
WHEN I LOOKED AT SAM, SHE
TOOK MY BREATH AWAY EVEN MORE.

27:40.441 --> 27:43.270
IT WAS WEIRD, I KNEW
SHE FELT IT TOO.

27:43.400 --> 27:45.098
I MEAN, WE BOTH DID.

27:45.228 --> 27:48.188
IT WAS LIKE WE SAW EACH OTHER
FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME.

27:48.754 --> 27:50.320
THE FORTUNE TELLER
PICKED UP A TAROT CARD

27:50.451 --> 27:51.887
THAT LANDED ON SAM.

27:52.018 --> 27:53.497
SHE LOOKED AT THE CARD,
LOOKED AT BOTH OF US,

27:53.628 --> 27:56.065
AND THEN SHE SAID,
"I SEE LOVE FOR YOU BOTH.

27:56.675 --> 27:59.939
"ALL-CONSUMING LOVE,
IT'S IN THE CARDS."

28:02.028 --> 28:05.640
AND THAT NIGHT, SHE
TURNED OUT TO BE RIGHT.

28:06.467 --> 28:07.860
-YOU UH--

28:07.990 --> 28:10.601
-"ALL-CONSUMING" IS
THE OPERATIVE WORD HERE.

28:10.732 --> 28:12.255
LOOK, THAT WAS
TWO WEEKS AGO.

28:12.386 --> 28:13.779
WE STILL HAVEN'T FIGURED
OUT WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE,

28:13.909 --> 28:14.823
SO WE REALLY DON'T WANT
ANYONE ELSE TO KNOW.

28:14.954 --> 28:15.955
-HEY, I HEAR YOU, MAN.

28:16.085 --> 28:17.260
-ESPECIALLY NEELY.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.046
-I WON'T SAY A WORD,
BUT I DON'T KNOW

28:20.176 --> 28:21.308
IF YOU CAN HIDE IT FROM HER.

28:21.438 --> 28:24.137
SHE'S PRETTY OBSERVANT.

28:24.920 --> 28:25.834
SEE YOU.

28:38.368 --> 28:39.892
-PULGA: EH, FOOL!

PUT THE GUN AWAY.

28:56.822 --> 28:58.824
PULGA, MAN, WHAT'S
WRONG WITH YOU, MAN?

28:58.954 --> 29:01.043
DON'T DO THIS, DON'T
SHOOT HIM, HOLMES.

-HEY, HEY, HEY,
WHERE YOU GOING, ESE?

29:10.313 --> 29:12.272
HEY, GET BACK
IN THE CAR, ESE.

29:14.665 --> 29:16.667
LEAVE HIM, FOOL. HE'S DEAD.

WHY DON'T WE JUST
TELL THEM ALL?

-OR, END IT NOW BEFORE
ANYONE GETS HURT.

THE WHOLE THING,

OF THIS NEVER HAPPENED.

A BUSINESS TOGETHER,

COMPLICATED AND CONFUSED,

31:36.720 --> 31:40.246

I SOLD HIM HALF OF MY BUSINESS

31:40.376 --> 31:42.770
AND RAN BACK HERE TO THE
BEACH JUST TO GET AWAY.

HURT EACH OTHER, BUT WE DID.
