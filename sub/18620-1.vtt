00:12.920 --> 00:14.260
Hello.

00:14.360 --> 00:16.340
In the traditional motion picture story,

00:16.440 --> 00:18.340
the villains are usually defeated,

00:18.440 --> 00:20.420
the ending is a happy one.

00:20.520 --> 00:23.780
I can make no such promise
for the picture you're about to watch.

00:23.880 --> 00:26.060
The story isn't over.

00:26.160 --> 00:28.128
You, in the audience,
are part of the conflict.

00:29.320 --> 00:30.860
What has happened so far

00:30.960 --> 00:33.884
and what is happening now
is far from encouraging.

00:34.560 --> 00:37.450
How we meet the Communist challenge
depends on you.

00:38.720 --> 00:42.140
We are united in detesting
Communist slavery.

00:42.240 --> 00:44.322
The Soviets are the best team
in the world.

00:44.600 --> 00:47.900
Hockey proved that the Soviet system
was the best system.

00:48.000 --> 00:51.004
When the Big Red Machine gets rolling,
they're mighty hard to stop.

00:54.640 --> 00:56.300
Their target is us.

00:56.400 --> 00:59.220
Our institutions,
our families, our children.

00:59.320 --> 01:01.260
The Soviets beginning
to create their attack...

01:01.360 --> 01:02.600
Brilliant play!

01:03.080 --> 01:04.379
Although they don't show emotion,

01:04.480 --> 01:06.801
let's face it,
they are a microcosm of their society.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.340
You talk about a dynasty!

01:08.440 --> 01:10.260
This is a bona fide superstar.

01:10.360 --> 01:11.540
Maybe best in the world.

01:11.640 --> 01:14.180
Slava Fetisov, one of the greatest
defensemen in the history...

01:14.280 --> 01:16.362
Fetisov, centered in front. They score!

01:16.480 --> 01:18.100
They were the totalitarian team.

01:18.200 --> 01:20.487
The KGB guys were always there.

01:38.200 --> 01:43.525
And it is sheer folly for us not to make
every conceivable preparation to win.

01:55.760 --> 01:59.401
Okay, I'd just like,
kind of, a few things about...

02:00.880 --> 02:03.820
Because, basically,
what I'm trying to get in the film is

02:03.920 --> 02:07.660
what it was like to live
in the Soviet Union.

02:07.760 --> 02:08.966
And...

02:12.760 --> 02:15.780
Yeah, and describe your feeling about...

02:15.880 --> 02:18.565
I'm busy now. Hold on.
I've got some business.

02:19.080 --> 02:20.286
Okay.

02:24.200 --> 02:26.140
My point is that American audiences

02:26.240 --> 02:30.460
don't really understand the things
that people didn't have

02:30.560 --> 02:32.340
or even the good things.

02:32.440 --> 02:36.580
But what are some things that you can say...
"We had to wait in line, or we had to..."

02:36.680 --> 02:40.162
That's a cliché, but,
"We had to do this, we had to do that."

02:43.040 --> 02:44.540
Travel, you know.

02:44.640 --> 02:49.089
Just basic things
that we take for granted these days.

02:49.280 --> 02:53.763
Like, this is... "Look, we couldn't travel.
We couldn't..." You know, whatever.

03:01.760 --> 03:05.820
I was born in the Soviet Union in '58.

03:05.920 --> 03:09.540
It was 13 years
after World War ll was over.

03:09.640 --> 03:12.900
The whole country was ruined.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.340
We lost 20 million people.

03:15.440 --> 03:16.965
It's a lot.

03:17.200 --> 03:19.646
We was living in Stalin's buildings.

03:19.760 --> 03:23.140
Probably a 400 square foot apartment.

03:23.240 --> 03:27.020
No running water,
no toilets, three families.

03:27.120 --> 03:30.203
It was a pretty rough lifestyle.

03:31.920 --> 03:34.241
I was a happy kid.

03:35.080 --> 03:38.004
I play a game. I play hockey.

03:49.240 --> 03:51.846
Pucks was empty cans
and stuff like that.

03:51.960 --> 03:53.849
But, we had fun.

03:56.640 --> 04:00.540
Our heroes played for the
Red Army Club, for the national team.

04:00.640 --> 04:04.180
Hockey was the most popular sport
in the Soviet Union

04:04.280 --> 04:06.900
because the Soviet hockey team

04:07.000 --> 04:11.500
represented the peak of what
the Soviet Union had achieved.

04:11.600 --> 04:15.127
And was proof that the Soviet
system was the best system.

04:17.040 --> 04:18.769
It was politics, really.

04:31.680 --> 04:34.580
My mom and dad,
they probably collected for two years.

04:34.680 --> 04:39.860
They bought for me gloves,
helmet, and the skates.

04:39.960 --> 04:43.940
On the black market,
it probably cost 250 rubles.

04:44.040 --> 04:47.249
It was big money for a Soviet family.

05:02.400 --> 05:04.420
There was a huge line of the boys.

05:04.520 --> 05:06.460
With the sticks. With the skates.

05:06.560 --> 05:08.780
With the parents. With the grandparents.

05:08.880 --> 05:13.442
It's unbelievable.
It's probably 3-4 miles long.

05:18.440 --> 05:21.091
When it was decided
that hockey would be the thing,

05:21.800 --> 05:24.849
money, everything went into that.

05:25.840 --> 05:29.020
They had a very well-organized system.

05:29.120 --> 05:31.860
I mean, from childhood to...

05:31.960 --> 05:35.601
They really picked out the best
of the best of the best.

05:36.080 --> 05:38.924
And this was a nationwide system.

05:42.760 --> 05:44.660
I was 9 years old.

05:44.760 --> 05:47.860
I stayed in line probably 7 or 8 hours.

05:47.960 --> 05:50.008
I was exhausted.

05:50.120 --> 05:52.340
I got no chance.

05:52.440 --> 05:56.660
They said, "Thank you very much.
Come again next year."

05:56.760 --> 06:00.207
So I practiced 3 or 4 times a day.

06:11.200 --> 06:15.540
Finally, they said I was good
enough to make the team.

06:15.640 --> 06:19.804
I was so proud to play for Red Army.

07:04.680 --> 07:07.860
Skate with no fear.

07:07.960 --> 07:12.420
We'll give you exercises
no one has ever seen.

07:12.520 --> 07:14.921
You'll be juggling your sticks,

07:16.360 --> 07:20.206
twisting them around your head.

07:22.040 --> 07:26.841
Where's the smile?
You're playing hockey!

07:27.320 --> 07:29.163
Jump! Quick!

07:31.440 --> 07:35.220
Tarasov was the father
of the Soviet system.

07:35.320 --> 07:36.260
Great!

07:36.360 --> 07:37.860
And the head coach of the Red Army.

07:37.960 --> 07:40.620
You'll become great hockey players!

07:40.720 --> 07:43.460
And great men!

07:43.560 --> 07:47.780
This man played a big role in my life.

07:47.880 --> 07:49.580
I was Red Army in my heart.

07:49.680 --> 07:52.126
I came there. I was 10 years old.

07:52.240 --> 07:56.300
Tarasov, he developed the program.

07:56.400 --> 08:00.140
He wrote a few books about hockey.

08:00.240 --> 08:04.928
These books laid next to my
bed since I was a little kid.

08:06.520 --> 08:10.570
He described the game
in a very simple way.

08:11.760 --> 08:13.660
Hockey is an aggressive game.

08:13.760 --> 08:15.460
It's not like tennis, right?

08:15.560 --> 08:17.300
So I wouldn't say that the North...

08:17.400 --> 08:20.140
The Americans, the Canadians
are more aggressive than the Russians.

08:20.240 --> 08:21.660
I wouldn't say that.

08:21.760 --> 08:23.740
But I do think that there was
a different concept

08:23.840 --> 08:25.080
of how you play the game.

08:25.760 --> 08:29.740
Tarasov, who was an extremely
creative man,

08:29.840 --> 08:34.980
he saw hockey
as this amazingly intricate game

08:35.080 --> 08:36.220
of passing the puck.

08:36.320 --> 08:39.500
The Soviets play more of
a finessed, improvisational game...

08:39.600 --> 08:42.888
And they could cut
and weave beautifully.

08:43.000 --> 08:47.660
Their passing game was
an intricate, artistic tapestry,

08:47.760 --> 08:50.047
which we didn't see over here.

08:51.200 --> 08:55.250
We emphasized everything
in a unit, of a collective.

08:56.640 --> 09:00.326
The puck carrier was the servant
of the other players.

09:03.800 --> 09:06.660
Our training camps were together.

09:06.760 --> 09:10.890
My chess team
and the national hockey team.

09:15.640 --> 09:17.700
They would often come to me

09:17.800 --> 09:21.691
if they had questions
on psychological training.

09:23.360 --> 09:28.460
He had theories of the way the game
should be played like a chess game.

09:28.560 --> 09:32.780
He studied the training of the Bolshoi,

09:32.880 --> 09:36.900
and he applied it to hockey.

09:37.000 --> 09:40.580
Look at these dances, eh?

09:40.680 --> 09:42.728
It's like the boogie woogie!

09:46.920 --> 09:49.700
Sport is an art form.

09:49.800 --> 09:51.609
That's what Tarasov thought.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.740
Creativity, a vivid mind, and constant

09:56.840 --> 10:01.323
thinking are needed for greatness.

10:06.160 --> 10:08.481
My father was not just a hockey coach.

10:11.040 --> 10:14.900
He was a great mentor.

10:15.000 --> 10:19.483
He could see the potential
in a young person.

10:21.840 --> 10:24.446
He developed my patriotism.

10:24.560 --> 10:26.500
For us, it's very important.

10:26.600 --> 10:30.660
For me since I was ten, it was
very important what was in front.

10:30.760 --> 10:33.411
The name of my team, my country.

10:51.920 --> 10:54.220
I belong to the great nation.

10:54.320 --> 10:56.740
If you wear the national team uniform,

10:56.840 --> 10:58.260
that's your duty. To do your best.

10:58.360 --> 11:01.250
To represent your country.

11:01.360 --> 11:05.809
For the Soviets, sports were,
in a way, a kind of warfare.

11:10.200 --> 11:12.500
The game, for them, wasn't just a game.

11:12.600 --> 11:16.605
It was also part of what you
would call propaganda, actually.

11:16.960 --> 11:18.820
Making it very clear
that we're the best,

11:18.920 --> 11:21.660
and we're the best
because of the Soviet system,

11:21.760 --> 11:23.205
because of socialism.

11:23.400 --> 11:25.209
That's why we're the best.

11:38.520 --> 11:40.568
At the moment, you are ahead of us.

11:44.720 --> 11:47.200
We still have a lot of work to do
to catch up with you.

11:48.600 --> 11:49.726
We'll do that.

11:50.280 --> 11:51.486
We'll catch up.

11:52.240 --> 11:53.420
We'll surpass you.

11:53.520 --> 11:56.980
You may perhaps laugh now,
but when we overtake you,

11:57.080 --> 12:01.324
we'll wave our hand as we say, "Capitalists!
Goodbye! Catch up if you can!"

12:09.160 --> 12:12.209
Have you ever watched hockey?

12:13.000 --> 12:15.810
I like playing with dolls.

12:16.040 --> 12:19.340
Do you know what these letters mean:

12:19.440 --> 12:22.220
K-G-B?

12:22.320 --> 12:24.060
No.

12:24.160 --> 12:26.300
Yeah, you were born much later.

12:26.400 --> 12:28.607
You didn't have to deal
with this organization.

12:33.520 --> 12:35.220
The Central Red Army prepare to travel

12:35.320 --> 12:37.660
to North America to play
a series of games

12:37.760 --> 12:40.001
against the best teams of the West.

12:40.920 --> 12:44.660
One outstanding player we didn't
see in last year's junior series

12:44.760 --> 12:47.889
was the brilliant defenseman
Viacheslav Fetisov.

12:48.480 --> 12:50.580
When we crossed the Atlantic
to play against

12:50.680 --> 12:54.730
the best Ontario clubs at 16 years old,
I was happy.

12:59.280 --> 13:01.300
There was one flight per week.

13:01.400 --> 13:04.100
Empty because nobody was flying.

13:04.200 --> 13:07.420
Of course, regular people cannot leave

13:07.520 --> 13:10.940
the country because that's the system.

13:11.040 --> 13:15.780
I used to go with them
to provide security,

13:15.880 --> 13:21.171
and to prevent any "escapes"
to the West.

13:22.200 --> 13:24.260
The "special people"
who traveled with us,

13:24.360 --> 13:26.900
they give your passport before you
get to passport control,

13:27.000 --> 13:32.040
and they collect the passport
when you cross the border.

13:33.520 --> 13:37.020
The Canadians put us
in a five-star hotel.

13:37.120 --> 13:38.804
Chandeliers. Marble.

13:38.920 --> 13:41.020
One room per player,

13:41.120 --> 13:42.406
and a hundred TV channels.

13:46.400 --> 13:50.485
Hey, right now, Loblaws is
having a huge frozen food sale.

13:51.080 --> 13:54.100
Fruits, vegetables in the wintertime.

13:54.200 --> 13:56.980
I've never seen it before for us.

13:57.080 --> 14:00.420
In the Soviet Union,
we got fish only one day a week.

14:00.520 --> 14:03.140
It was "Fish Thursday."

14:03.240 --> 14:07.420
When people went abroad,
especially for the first time,

14:07.520 --> 14:11.764
they were so surprised
by the differences.

14:12.280 --> 14:13.460
We got $48.

14:13.560 --> 14:17.140
They gave us pocket money.

14:17.240 --> 14:19.500
I bought 2 jeans, 3 pair of shorts.

14:19.600 --> 14:23.207
Lots of stuff which just didn't
exist in Moscow.

14:24.600 --> 14:28.820
However, they never saw

14:28.920 --> 14:33.847
the negative side
of the other countries.

14:35.880 --> 14:38.180
Control was intense.

14:38.280 --> 14:42.649
Without such intense control,
there was no point in the work at all.

14:44.480 --> 14:49.340
I was never even thinking
about to defect.

14:49.440 --> 14:53.220
Never. What's that mean?

14:53.320 --> 14:54.685
It meant you were happy.

14:54.800 --> 14:56.643
I'm happy.

15:00.640 --> 15:03.420
Tonight, Team Canada
hosts the Soviet Union.

15:03.520 --> 15:05.488
It's a team we've never seen.

15:07.320 --> 15:10.608
The building was 12,000 people. Packed.

15:11.560 --> 15:14.300
I was so nervous, y'know?

15:14.400 --> 15:16.020
We got shitty gear.

15:16.120 --> 15:19.580
- Canada versus the Soviet Union.
- Team Canada has a definite edge.

15:19.680 --> 15:21.580
The two things
that Team Canada do the best,

15:21.680 --> 15:23.220
they shoot better and they skate better.

15:23.320 --> 15:25.420
Canadians, fans and sportswriters
seem to agree

15:25.520 --> 15:27.682
their team will clobber
the Russian pretenders.

15:36.160 --> 15:37.650
We beat them in all 5 games.

15:41.200 --> 15:43.407
Fetisov over the line.
Fetisov trying to get it out in front.

15:43.520 --> 15:45.460
Throws it out in front.
They shoot, they score!

15:45.560 --> 15:47.780
Fetisov back out of the slot.
Fetisov feeds.

15:47.880 --> 15:49.980
Fetisov with a brilliant play.
He scores!

15:50.080 --> 15:51.100
He scores!

15:51.200 --> 15:53.620
- Fetisov.
- Fetisov.

15:53.720 --> 15:54.900
And the game is over.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.810
The Soviet Union has beaten Team Canada.

16:01.560 --> 16:04.940
Viacheslav Fetisov.
His teammates call him Slava.

16:05.040 --> 16:07.020
He's undoubtedly
one of the great young stars

16:07.120 --> 16:08.700
of the Central Red Army team.

16:08.800 --> 16:10.980
It's been said of him
that he can skate backwards

16:11.080 --> 16:13.890
as fast as most defensemen
can skate forwards.

16:14.040 --> 16:16.620
Kids growing up
now want to play like Fetisov.

16:16.720 --> 16:18.460
Which players do you like the best?

16:18.560 --> 16:19.800
- Fetisov.
- Fetisov.

16:28.160 --> 16:33.769
Okay, Gabe. Let's go. Let's go. Work!

16:33.880 --> 16:37.980
You guys are used to doing
nothing over there in America.

16:38.080 --> 16:39.764
Yeah. Okay.

16:41.520 --> 16:43.921
I want to ask you about Viktor Tikhonov.

16:44.840 --> 16:46.900
How did he become
the national team coach,

16:47.000 --> 16:49.082
and what was your relationship to him?

17:02.520 --> 17:04.980
Tarasov got in trouble because

17:05.079 --> 17:07.859
Tarasov's team scored a goal,
but it wasn't counted.

17:07.960 --> 17:11.420
And he became so angry,

17:11.520 --> 17:13.249
he actually took his players
off the ice.

17:16.280 --> 17:18.180
Tarasov disagreed and stopped the game.

17:18.280 --> 17:20.700
We didn't play for 40 minutes.

17:20.800 --> 17:22.608
And there sat Brezhnev.

17:24.560 --> 17:27.211
And Brezhnev was saying,
"What the hell is this?"

17:30.920 --> 17:34.481
They removed him from the national team.

17:34.800 --> 17:36.962
They punished him for this.

17:39.920 --> 17:44.130
The KGB Chief was a fan
of the Red Army Club.

17:45.160 --> 17:47.208
Tikhonov was his protégé.

17:52.800 --> 17:55.700
You mean, Tikhonov was so powerful
in the Communist Party that they made him...

17:55.800 --> 17:57.040
What do you mean powerful?

17:57.160 --> 17:58.140
I mean, can't someone just say...

17:58.240 --> 18:00.020
What do you mean powerful?
He's a part of the system.

18:00.120 --> 18:03.860
The Chief of the KGB put him
in the position.

18:03.960 --> 18:08.249
Viktor Tikhonov was disliked or detested
by most of the players.

18:09.000 --> 18:12.004
If we didn't obey,
he would punish us severely.

18:14.840 --> 18:16.968
He would take your salary
or bar you from playing.

18:17.760 --> 18:19.580
Some rather vigorous discussion.

18:19.680 --> 18:22.923
Our friend, Mr. Tikhonov, is ticked off,
if you'll forgive the expression.

18:26.560 --> 18:29.260
Tikhonov's been heavily criticized
by some of the players.

18:29.360 --> 18:31.540
One of them said if he ever
needs a heart transplant,

18:31.640 --> 18:33.927
he wants Viktor's
because Viktor's never used his.

18:38.200 --> 18:40.780
You can see him
yelling at them on the bench,

18:40.880 --> 18:45.568
and, actually, he would hit them in practice,
and smash them in the head.

18:46.560 --> 18:47.766
Hammer them like this.

18:48.400 --> 18:50.460
I'm very volatile.

18:50.560 --> 18:55.660
That's how I am.

18:55.760 --> 18:58.860
And the guys know that.

18:58.960 --> 19:02.780
They know when to approach me.

19:02.880 --> 19:04.780
He's looking a little bit
deranged right there.

19:04.880 --> 19:08.460
Tikhonov was in a very advanced
position from the beginning.

19:08.560 --> 19:11.140
He got the best team in the world.

19:11.240 --> 19:14.140
He got all kinds of support
from the government.

19:14.240 --> 19:18.460
In the Soviet Union,
you can get any player.

19:18.560 --> 19:23.282
You draft him into the army
and he becomes a Red Army player.

19:24.920 --> 19:29.100
Can Tikhonov be successful without us?

19:29.200 --> 19:31.500
I don't know.

19:31.600 --> 19:35.820
We being successful without him?

19:35.920 --> 19:38.660
I think so.

19:38.760 --> 19:43.049
Here, suddenly, there was a team
that actually could beat Team Canada.

19:43.600 --> 19:46.763
And the hockey players
were all considered as heroes.

19:47.720 --> 19:51.486
And hockey itself became
tremendously popular in the country.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.890
Can you tell me
about your first Olympics?

20:11.640 --> 20:14.007
Want a story? You got the time?

20:17.480 --> 20:21.020
I come to you this evening to
discuss the extremely important

20:21.120 --> 20:24.408
and rapidly changing
circumstances in Southwest Asia.

20:25.880 --> 20:29.260
Massive Soviet military forces
have invaded

20:29.360 --> 20:33.060
the small, nonaligned
sovereign nation of Afghanistan.

20:33.160 --> 20:37.380
A Soviet-occupied Afghanistan
is a stepping stone

20:37.480 --> 20:41.644
to possible control over much
of the world's oil supplies.

20:42.000 --> 20:46.260
It is a deliberate effort of
a powerful, atheistic government

20:46.360 --> 20:50.260
to subjugate an independent
Islamic people.

20:50.360 --> 20:52.900
Heavy fighting continues in Afghanistan.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.580
With invading Soviet troops
in parts of the country,

20:55.680 --> 20:59.651
world indignation at the apparent
Soviet takeover is coming to a head.

21:00.360 --> 21:05.420
Cold War passions
were running very, very hot.

21:05.520 --> 21:08.420
And then, the United States
happened to be hosting

21:08.520 --> 21:10.761
the Olympic Games at Lake Placid.

21:13.080 --> 21:16.721
They had this Cold War
political flavor to it.

21:18.080 --> 21:20.420
The David versus Goliath
matchup featuring

21:20.520 --> 21:23.580
a US team comprised of
inexperienced college players

21:23.680 --> 21:25.940
going up against a veteran Soviet team

21:26.040 --> 21:29.060
widely regarded
as the best hockey team in the world.

21:29.160 --> 21:31.100
The United States
had lost an exhibition game

21:31.200 --> 21:34.727
to the Soviets, 10-3,
a couple weeks before the Olympics.

21:35.960 --> 21:39.760
That showed the difference in skill level
between the two teams.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.980
The excitement, the tension building.

21:46.080 --> 21:48.700
The Olympic Center filling to capacity.

21:48.800 --> 21:52.220
In a political or nationalistic sense,
I'm sure this game is being viewed

21:52.320 --> 21:55.260
with varying perspectives,
but it is a hockey game.

21:55.360 --> 21:58.180
The United States and the Soviet Union
on a sheet of ice

21:58.280 --> 22:00.220
in Lake Placid, New York.

22:00.320 --> 22:01.980
Here we go, as the game is underway.

22:02.080 --> 22:04.860
The Soviet Union in red
and the United States in white.

22:04.960 --> 22:08.169
It's been 20 years since an American team
has beat the Soviets.

22:09.160 --> 22:11.660
Pavelich up ahead to Schneider.
Slap shot! Goes in!

22:11.760 --> 22:12.886
A winner!

22:21.760 --> 22:24.340
The United States has tied the game!

22:24.440 --> 22:26.740
A couple of months ago, would you have
believed this would be possible?

22:26.840 --> 22:27.820
Very careless rebound.

22:27.920 --> 22:30.526
An uncharacteristically
careless rebound by Tretiak.

22:34.120 --> 22:35.380
Here's Tretiak on the bench.

22:35.480 --> 22:37.767
A very uncharacteristic place for him.

22:38.680 --> 22:40.020
He leaves it for Zhluktov.

22:40.120 --> 22:42.340
Zhluktov, number 22,
who passes it to Makarov.

22:42.440 --> 22:43.851
Craig makes the save.

22:51.200 --> 22:53.009
He shoots, and he scores!

23:05.640 --> 23:07.688
4-3, the United States on top.

23:09.760 --> 23:10.700
Checked by Ramsey.

23:10.800 --> 23:12.860
McClanahan is there.
The puck is still loose.

23:12.960 --> 23:15.008
Eleven seconds. You got 10 seconds.

23:15.120 --> 23:16.700
The countdown going on right now.

23:16.800 --> 23:18.380
Morrow up to Silk.

23:18.480 --> 23:20.220
Five seconds left in the game!

23:20.320 --> 23:22.940
Do you believe in miracles? Yes!

23:23.040 --> 23:24.540
Unbelievable!

23:24.640 --> 23:28.420
USA! USA! USA!

23:28.520 --> 23:31.683
USA! USA!

23:36.000 --> 23:38.401
We're number one. We rule. US rules!

23:38.640 --> 23:40.500
Destiny.

23:40.600 --> 23:43.740
And tell the whole team
that we are extremely proud of them.

23:43.840 --> 23:45.900
They've come through
like true champions.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.580
It was a great win, you know,
for everybody,

23:48.680 --> 23:51.780
and I think it just proves
that our way of life

23:51.880 --> 23:53.848
is the proper way to continue on.

24:09.120 --> 24:10.565
It was tough.

24:12.840 --> 24:15.020
You better believe
the Soviet authorities are not happy.

24:15.120 --> 24:17.580
The government will certainly
be taking matters into their own hands.

24:17.680 --> 24:18.740
...if they don't see an opportunity...

24:18.840 --> 24:19.940
What's the price they pay over there?

24:20.040 --> 24:23.010
Finally, tonight, from overseas,
a story about hockey.

24:23.200 --> 24:26.020
A team in the Soviet Union
is still dwelling on

24:26.120 --> 24:28.043
a championship lost.

24:28.360 --> 24:30.362
There have been some changes made.

24:33.720 --> 24:36.300
After the Olympic games,

24:36.400 --> 24:40.041
Tikhonov fired the veterans.

24:41.760 --> 24:43.046
It's wrong.

24:44.040 --> 24:46.380
All these guys,
all these supporting staff,

24:46.480 --> 24:48.300
this is the successful team.

24:48.400 --> 24:49.925
Not him.

24:53.240 --> 24:56.300
After that game,
the workload became tremendous.

24:56.400 --> 24:58.482
There were players who pissed blood.

25:03.360 --> 25:05.900
We practiced four times a day
in the summertime.

25:06.000 --> 25:07.331
Four times.

25:07.440 --> 25:09.660
We're working at a heart rate of 220.

25:09.760 --> 25:11.489
Can you imagine? 220.

25:14.080 --> 25:16.340
Players had to live
in these hockey camps,

25:16.440 --> 25:19.011
isolated 11 months of the year.

25:19.760 --> 25:23.481
And they would get out
maybe one weekend every month.

25:30.880 --> 25:36.340
You win by being merciless in training.

25:36.440 --> 25:42.402
The coach must perpetuate
this tradition.

25:43.440 --> 25:47.540
A coach must find a player's pressure

25:47.640 --> 25:51.440
points to achieve maximum results.

25:55.480 --> 26:00.540
It's the carrot and the stick,
like an animal trainer.

26:00.640 --> 26:05.180
To get masterpieces from the beasts,

26:05.280 --> 26:08.284
you have to force them a little bit.

26:30.640 --> 26:33.540
Did I respect him?

26:33.640 --> 26:36.020
As my coach? Yes.

26:36.120 --> 26:38.885
As a person? No.

26:41.440 --> 26:44.380
The Soviets are back
after that American defeat,

26:44.480 --> 26:46.020
back in 1980 at Lake Placid.

26:46.120 --> 26:48.500
Well, there aren't many left
from that 1980 team.

26:48.600 --> 26:50.841
Fetisov, a couple
of their superstars remain,

26:50.960 --> 26:53.566
but the rest of the team
has been completely rebuilt.

26:59.600 --> 27:01.740
You have to be born a goalie.

27:01.840 --> 27:03.410
I am a destroyer.

27:05.560 --> 27:09.690
I destroy the plans of the adversary.

27:10.080 --> 27:11.980
Vladislav Tretiak in the net.

27:12.080 --> 27:14.420
The best goalie in the world.

27:14.520 --> 27:16.660
Tretiak is almost unbeatable.

27:16.760 --> 27:20.580
The greatest goaltender
the game has ever seen.

27:20.680 --> 27:25.971
Tikhonov was given
ready-to-use material.

27:26.080 --> 27:28.242
Tarasov had created stars.

27:28.680 --> 27:31.126
It was to his credit that
he created a five-man unit.

27:31.240 --> 27:33.083
They were the best.

27:40.600 --> 27:43.524
...are the strike force
of the Soviet team.

27:43.640 --> 27:47.100
When the five got together,
no one knew how to play them.

27:47.200 --> 27:50.568
At left wing, number 24, Sergei Makarov.

27:52.320 --> 27:54.482
He was the most dangerous player
in the world.

27:54.600 --> 27:57.100
The mastery and the wizardry of Makarov,

27:57.200 --> 28:00.010
who hung onto that puck
and then just gave it.

28:01.080 --> 28:03.500
He can make the goal
from nowhere, anytime.

28:03.600 --> 28:06.420
He scored more goals than
anybody in our hockey history.

28:06.520 --> 28:08.284
And they score!

28:11.280 --> 28:15.126
At right wing, number nine,
Vladimir Krutov.

28:15.640 --> 28:17.847
He was a Russian tank.

28:19.440 --> 28:21.700
Krutov here, only 5'9

28:21.800 --> 28:24.371
but he weighs almost 200 pounds.

28:26.280 --> 28:29.170
He was the soul of the five-man unit.

28:32.640 --> 28:35.860
At center, number 11, Igor Larionov.

28:35.960 --> 28:37.020
Igor was the professor.

28:37.120 --> 28:39.566
I've got a question.
Why was he "the professor"?

28:39.920 --> 28:42.620
Because he was skinny like that.

28:42.720 --> 28:45.291
Not a professor, maybe nerd.

28:47.200 --> 28:48.850
Skinny but tough.

28:49.400 --> 28:51.050
It kind of misleads lots of guys.

28:54.680 --> 28:57.684
Number seven, Alexei Kasatonov.

29:00.840 --> 29:03.020
He was my best friend.

29:03.120 --> 29:05.100
Seven and two, Fetisov and Kasatonov.

29:05.200 --> 29:07.020
They've played together for so long

29:07.120 --> 29:09.220
that they know each other's
moves instinctively.

29:09.320 --> 29:11.180
And when one goes in,
the other kind of trails back,

29:11.280 --> 29:12.700
and it just works for them.

29:12.800 --> 29:14.740
Fetisov to Kasatonov.

29:14.840 --> 29:16.569
Shoots, he scores!

29:17.240 --> 29:19.766
He was teammate. He was roommate.

29:21.080 --> 29:24.562
Alex became my younger brother.

29:25.280 --> 29:26.780
My mom cooked for him,

29:26.880 --> 29:30.851
and my grandpa was like his grandpa.

29:31.960 --> 29:37.000
It's tough to find any closer relationship
between two men.

29:39.760 --> 29:43.740
Alex is probably the best all-around
defensemen ever to play the game.

29:43.840 --> 29:48.562
I believe he (Slava) was the best defenseman
in the history of world hockey.

29:48.680 --> 29:51.889
Number two, Viacheslav Fetisov.

29:53.040 --> 29:54.883
Slava was our leader, of course.

29:55.720 --> 29:57.529
In the way he skated, his character.

29:58.920 --> 30:01.460
And he gets leveled by Fetisov.

30:01.560 --> 30:03.460
Fetisov showing that good strength.

30:03.560 --> 30:06.564
6'1 205 pounds. He's no small player.

30:08.040 --> 30:11.140
Tikhonov came from the Politburo
and said:

30:11.240 --> 30:14.980
"Slava, I got good news.

30:15.080 --> 30:18.740
"You're going to be captain of
the Soviet National Team."

30:18.840 --> 30:20.922
I said, "Thank you, but I'm not."

30:22.040 --> 30:23.929
He said, "You stupid?"

30:24.920 --> 30:27.321
I said, "I'm not."

30:27.880 --> 30:30.060
But when I talked to the guys,

30:30.160 --> 30:32.481
they said, "We want you
to be our captain."

30:34.200 --> 30:35.645
I said, "Okay."

30:36.920 --> 30:38.820
Why they choose me, I don't know.

30:38.920 --> 30:42.049
But I become the youngest ever
captain of the national team.

30:50.280 --> 30:52.620
In Soviet hockey,
the lines stay together.

30:52.720 --> 30:54.006
Five-man unit.

30:54.120 --> 30:56.820
They like to keep the line
and the two defensemen together

30:56.920 --> 30:58.809
for as long as they possibly can.

30:59.440 --> 31:05.402
We were great friends in real life.

31:06.440 --> 31:11.731
I tell you, they were good people,
kind and always ready to help.

31:13.120 --> 31:16.180
We never let each other down.

31:16.280 --> 31:17.725
What were they like as individuals?

31:22.400 --> 31:24.641
We were all practically
the same, you know?

31:25.800 --> 31:28.860
We'd celebrate the birthdays,
the family things.

31:28.960 --> 31:34.100
We went to restaurants together.
We would spend vacation time.

31:34.200 --> 31:36.380
We were all the same.

31:36.480 --> 31:38.460
But did they read, have hobbies?

31:38.560 --> 31:39.891
What were their personalities?

31:40.000 --> 31:43.209
We were the same.

31:43.760 --> 31:47.481
Why are you asking me the same thing?

31:48.480 --> 31:50.642
They just clicked from the get-go.

31:50.760 --> 31:54.481
They had a lot of confidence in each other,
and they had a lot of pride.

31:54.600 --> 31:59.731
And those players will go down in history
as the greatest five-man units of all time.

32:01.520 --> 32:03.100
They had a sixth sense about them.

32:03.200 --> 32:05.362
They had eyes in the back of their head.

32:07.560 --> 32:10.660
Sometimes you feel without a look.

32:10.760 --> 32:12.000
Your partner must be there.

32:12.600 --> 32:14.580
The Soviets really perfected the weave.

32:14.680 --> 32:16.140
They move like one body.

32:16.240 --> 32:18.368
Holy cow, what a play by the Soviets!

32:19.200 --> 32:21.340
Fetisov was number two in scoring,

32:21.440 --> 32:24.580
even though he was a defender.

32:24.680 --> 32:27.620
He would go forward
and Makarov would draw back.

32:27.720 --> 32:29.006
They score!

32:30.040 --> 32:31.780
Everything was like this.

32:31.880 --> 32:35.140
The opponents did not know who to cover.

32:35.240 --> 32:37.900
Circling back, Fetisov,
Larionov, Makarov.

32:38.000 --> 32:39.001
He scores!

32:39.600 --> 32:42.540
The goals that they scored
would be highlight reel goals.

32:42.640 --> 32:44.483
They all touched the puck.

32:45.200 --> 32:47.100
The skill level of that team
was astounding.

32:47.200 --> 32:50.363
They elevated hockey to an art form.

32:52.400 --> 32:54.940
No one could hold them back.

32:55.040 --> 32:57.441
What they did on the ice...

32:58.560 --> 33:00.483
Yes, they were the best.

33:01.240 --> 33:04.140
The Soviet Union
has defeated Team Canada

33:04.240 --> 33:06.460
8-1 in the Canada Cup.

33:06.560 --> 33:10.180
And this crowd here at the Forum
has gone very quiet

33:10.280 --> 33:12.408
as Scotty Bowman looks on.

33:12.520 --> 33:15.860
We had Wayne Gretzky,
Guy Lafleur, Gilbert Perreault.

33:15.960 --> 33:17.380
But they whipped us so bad.

33:17.480 --> 33:18.845
We didn't expect it.

33:19.080 --> 33:21.980
They have beaten the Islanders,
the Boston Bruins,

33:22.080 --> 33:23.620
and now the Jersey Devils.

33:23.720 --> 33:25.660
A Soviet team has defeated

33:25.760 --> 33:28.060
the defending Stanley Cup champion.
The first time ever.

33:28.160 --> 33:31.607
They've outscored the opposition 42-5.

33:31.760 --> 33:33.980
The Soviets are the best team
in the world.

33:34.080 --> 33:36.020
Gold medal, give it to the Russians.
Let them go home.

33:36.120 --> 33:38.300
- You just don't see how it can get any better.
- He scores!

33:38.400 --> 33:40.060
Well, you know,
the Russians are so darn good.

33:40.160 --> 33:41.420
One man and a goalie to beat.

33:41.520 --> 33:43.648
Drops it back. Krutov scores.

33:44.080 --> 33:45.764
That's how it's done.

33:46.120 --> 33:48.327
You'll not see any nicer
than that, folks.

33:48.440 --> 33:50.020
You just can't compete.

33:50.120 --> 33:51.380
It's just too difficult.

33:51.480 --> 33:54.290
When the Big Red Machine gets rolling,
they're mighty hard to stop.

33:59.960 --> 34:01.540
This is the big one.

34:01.640 --> 34:03.900
So, we are now
into the gold medal match.

34:04.000 --> 34:07.368
It's Czechoslovakia
against the Soviet Union.

34:07.480 --> 34:08.780
For the Soviets, it's very,
very important

34:08.880 --> 34:11.540
because they didn't take that medal
in Lake Placid in 1980.

34:11.639 --> 34:13.540
And if the Czechs take it
from them this time,

34:13.639 --> 34:16.643
there will really be
a shake-up in Soviet hockey.

34:18.480 --> 34:20.050
This is Larionov, number 11.

34:20.159 --> 34:21.500
Drops it back. Getting set.

34:21.600 --> 34:22.699
Here's Kasatonov.

34:22.800 --> 34:24.260
Back to Larionov.

34:24.360 --> 34:25.820
Larionov is checked.

34:25.920 --> 34:27.420
Krutov has it in behind the net.

34:27.520 --> 34:29.620
Makarov is standing
right in front of the goal.

34:29.719 --> 34:30.860
Here's Krutov.

34:30.960 --> 34:32.962
He gets it back, now to Fetisov.

34:34.040 --> 34:36.460
Fetisov setting up. Slides it in front.

34:36.560 --> 34:38.005
Krutov scores!

34:39.040 --> 34:42.328
Krutov! And it's 2-0 for the Soviets!

34:57.280 --> 34:59.740
It was the greatest moment in my life.

34:59.840 --> 35:02.260
My childhood dream come true.

35:02.360 --> 35:03.850
I got this gold medal.

35:06.200 --> 35:09.761
I was the happiest man in the world.

35:23.240 --> 35:28.041
My brother, his name was Anatoly.

35:30.360 --> 35:36.367
I think he would be one of the
best forwards ever to play the game.

35:38.800 --> 35:40.660
He was like a son to me.

35:40.760 --> 35:44.560
We got almost 10 years apart.

35:47.040 --> 35:52.126
He was killed in a car accident in 1985.

35:55.360 --> 35:58.330
I was driving the car.

36:13.040 --> 36:17.460
To be in a situation like that,

36:17.560 --> 36:21.820
I didn't want to live.

36:21.920 --> 36:26.960
I share everything they go through.

36:27.080 --> 36:31.420
All the training,
all happiness and sadness.

36:31.520 --> 36:35.380
Losses and victories, all the positive,

36:35.480 --> 36:39.121
and the negative, too.

36:39.520 --> 36:43.860
Andrei Khomutov found out
his father was going to die soon.

36:43.960 --> 36:45.660
He came to him and said,

36:45.760 --> 36:48.889
"Viktor, can you let me go
to see my father?"

36:50.120 --> 36:52.020
He said, "No.

36:52.120 --> 36:54.566
"You have to get ready
for the next game."

36:56.240 --> 36:58.620
Andrei never saw his father again.

36:58.720 --> 37:00.980
This was tough to imagine for me,

37:01.080 --> 37:03.128
that Tikhonov can do
something like that.

37:04.120 --> 37:07.220
The players often ask,
"What is this all for?

37:07.320 --> 37:10.860
"Why get maximum scores?

37:10.960 --> 37:13.611
"Maybe we should rest a little."

37:14.400 --> 37:17.768
It's absurd.

37:19.320 --> 37:21.740
They was eleven months at camp.

37:21.840 --> 37:23.900
Training camp.

37:24.000 --> 37:27.020
And thirty-six nights, they was home.

37:27.120 --> 37:30.567
They never get out of that camp.

37:35.520 --> 37:39.700
We always fight against Tikhonov
to let us live at home.

37:39.800 --> 37:42.500
But he said,
"This is the style of my team.

37:42.600 --> 37:48.562
"And this is the style of Soviet sport
in the Soviet Union."

37:51.280 --> 37:53.260
I'm by myself in the apartment.

37:53.360 --> 37:55.260
And when he talks on the phone with me,

37:55.360 --> 37:57.340
it's like lines staying behind him,

37:57.440 --> 37:58.860
and everybody listening.

37:58.960 --> 38:04.649
Because it's one phone
and it's like twenty-five guys.

38:08.800 --> 38:11.660
We get together, the Russian 5,

38:11.760 --> 38:14.580
and said, "Can we lose
the World Championships next?

38:14.680 --> 38:17.580
"Maybe they'll kick his ass
out of the team.

38:17.680 --> 38:21.180
"And we can live a better life."

38:21.280 --> 38:24.420
I'm telling you,
so many times we asked ourselves,

38:24.520 --> 38:25.900
"Why are you suffering so much?

38:26.000 --> 38:31.962
"Why play for a guy who doesn't
respect us as a human being?"

38:32.240 --> 38:34.060
In the Soviet period,

38:34.160 --> 38:37.300
the individual had to obey very strictly

38:37.400 --> 38:39.140
and had no say.

38:39.240 --> 38:42.926
And if he tried to have a say,
that could end his career.

38:46.560 --> 38:49.848
So many competitions
and you are never home.

38:53.400 --> 38:56.980
At first, I'd get home
and Dima wouldn't recognize me.

38:57.080 --> 38:58.660
I'd ask him, "Where's your dad?"

38:58.760 --> 39:01.001
And he would show me photographs.

39:07.080 --> 39:08.161
Your youth is wasted.

39:08.280 --> 39:12.330
New Year's Eve, holidays, birthdays...

39:15.920 --> 39:17.888
You're always alone with the team,

39:18.000 --> 39:20.980
without your wife and kids.
It's a tough life.

39:21.080 --> 39:26.803
At 32, I felt old and worn out.

39:26.920 --> 39:30.220
I wanted freedom to train
on my own, or to stop playing.

39:30.320 --> 39:36.123
So I was forced to quit.

39:51.640 --> 39:53.500
There was a lot of disillusionment

39:53.600 --> 39:56.524
that was going on in the Soviet Union.

40:09.640 --> 40:11.460
For over 70 years,

40:11.560 --> 40:13.900
the Soviet Union was a closed society

40:14.000 --> 40:16.685
and the Iron Curtain was a reality.

40:17.880 --> 40:20.121
The belief that existed for so long

40:20.320 --> 40:22.020
that had really held
the country together,

40:22.120 --> 40:26.842
the profound, idealistic belief
that was part of it, dissipated.

40:39.400 --> 40:43.620
Dear comrades, delegates,

40:43.720 --> 40:46.485
a new democratic era is upon us.

40:56.000 --> 40:59.004
Do you think people realized
that this was the end of the Cold War?

41:00.160 --> 41:02.180
What's the Cold War?

41:02.280 --> 41:03.260
The Cold War.

41:03.360 --> 41:04.620
No, I know. What's the Cold War?

41:04.720 --> 41:05.846
What's it about?

41:06.640 --> 41:08.780
About the money?

41:08.880 --> 41:10.100
About business?

41:10.200 --> 41:11.740
Sure, probably. You think so?

41:11.840 --> 41:12.780
For resources?

41:12.880 --> 41:15.042
I think so.

41:15.160 --> 41:16.140
Nothing else?

41:16.240 --> 41:17.620
I think it's just about fear.

41:17.720 --> 41:19.768
Fear of what?

41:20.760 --> 41:22.762
National security, probably, right?

41:24.240 --> 41:25.540
That's bullshit.

41:25.640 --> 41:27.980
The sports world has heard
the Russians are coming.

41:28.080 --> 41:30.140
That is, that some
of those world-class athletes

41:30.240 --> 41:32.860
that are in the Soviet Union
will be allowed to come west,

41:32.960 --> 41:34.883
turn pro and play for big rubles.

41:35.240 --> 41:37.686
Soviet athletes are in big demand.

41:38.520 --> 41:42.445
New Jersey Devils have offered
defenseman Viacheslav Fetisov

41:42.560 --> 41:46.060
a half million dollars
for just one year along the blue line.

41:46.160 --> 41:48.980
We think that they will raise
the level of excellence

41:49.080 --> 41:51.003
in the entire National Hockey League.

41:51.240 --> 41:54.700
The only reason these well-dressed
and well-off hockey bosses

41:54.800 --> 41:56.820
even consider selling players

41:56.920 --> 41:59.180
is that they have been told
by the Politburo

41:59.280 --> 42:02.220
their big subsidies must be cut.

42:02.320 --> 42:06.450
The sale of defenseman Fetisov
to New Jersey is one way out.

42:07.080 --> 42:09.180
It is not something
those officials want to do,

42:09.280 --> 42:12.340
but in this clash of capitalism
and socialism,

42:12.440 --> 42:14.522
money is proving to be the big lure.

42:15.800 --> 42:18.900
And if you're a Soviet player,
and you see what's ahead for yourself,

42:19.000 --> 42:21.526
except more of this dreariness.

42:21.640 --> 42:23.180
And then they realized, "My God.

42:23.280 --> 42:28.220
"Look what these teams and the players have
in the NHL and the money they get,

42:28.320 --> 42:31.210
"and the automobiles
and the houses and the vacations."

42:31.800 --> 42:34.724
Then you're gonna want like hell
to get out of there.

42:36.720 --> 42:40.700
Tikhonov came from the Politburo
to the training camp and said,

42:40.800 --> 42:47.540
"Slava, if you do good in Calgary,
in the Olympics, you win the gold medal,

42:47.640 --> 42:52.020
"you're gonna be the first Soviet player
who go play in National Hockey League."

42:52.120 --> 42:53.451
I said, "Okay."

42:56.960 --> 43:00.009
The face of the Soviet Union,
Slava Fetisov.

43:01.320 --> 43:04.660
There's the captain of the Soviet Union,

43:04.760 --> 43:05.980
Viacheslav Fetisov,

43:06.080 --> 43:08.560
representing his team
on the podium here.

43:08.680 --> 43:10.330
I was so happy.

43:12.520 --> 43:15.740
When I landed in Moscow,
they called me to the Ministry.

43:15.840 --> 43:18.540
They give me in the Kremlin,
the Lenin Award.

43:18.640 --> 43:21.246
The biggest award in the country.

43:21.680 --> 43:25.220
And then I was called for private talk
between three men:

43:25.320 --> 43:27.527
The Minister of Sport,
Tikhonov and myself.

43:29.680 --> 43:32.900
When the Minister said,
"Slava, finally you deserve it.

43:33.000 --> 43:36.420
"We'll let you go. Good luck
and I wish you all the best."

43:36.520 --> 43:41.780
And he said, "Am I right, Viktor?"

43:41.880 --> 43:44.620
You know what Viktor said?

43:44.720 --> 43:48.820
"Yeah, you're right. But I need
him for another year.

43:48.920 --> 43:54.609
"Because we can't replace him."

43:57.720 --> 44:02.362
He said, "January 2nd, we got the
Super Series against New Jersey.

44:04.200 --> 44:07.140
"And we promise you after
the game against New Jersey,

44:07.240 --> 44:11.643
"you're going to finish
the season in the NHL."

44:16.400 --> 44:18.380
Fetisov goes back to get it.

44:18.480 --> 44:20.140
Top scoring defenseman.

44:20.240 --> 44:22.060
Four times Player of the Year.

44:22.160 --> 44:24.401
Fetisov right there, he scores!

44:24.560 --> 44:26.927
It's a four-to-nothing Red Army lead.

44:27.320 --> 44:29.049
Is Slava Fetisov coming to the NHL?

44:30.520 --> 44:32.682
It's possible for him to stay here.

44:33.800 --> 44:34.801
Now?

44:35.040 --> 44:37.042
Not now, eventually.

44:39.600 --> 44:44.940
See what happened?
Publicly he said, "He can go."

44:45.040 --> 44:51.047
But inside, not behind my back,
in front of me he said, "No."

44:51.760 --> 44:53.380
What's the current status of this thing?

44:53.480 --> 44:56.500
We keep hearing yes, and then we hear no,
and then we hear maybe.

44:56.600 --> 44:58.340
Well, really, the status right now,

44:58.440 --> 45:00.408
it relies in the hands
of the Soviet government.

45:00.800 --> 45:02.380
Slava Fetisov wants to be here,

45:02.480 --> 45:04.180
and he wants to play
in the National Hockey League.

45:04.280 --> 45:07.020
But really, we have no control
over what is happening right now.

45:07.120 --> 45:09.122
Neither has Fetisov.

45:10.280 --> 45:15.286
Lou Lamoriello
showed me around New York.

45:16.280 --> 45:21.420
He said, "Slava, I learned today
they'll never let you go."

45:21.520 --> 45:24.340
He said, "This is the life.

45:24.440 --> 45:26.329
"You should stay here."

45:28.600 --> 45:31.683
So when Lou asked you to defect,
did you consider it?

45:33.640 --> 45:35.847
No.

45:35.960 --> 45:37.540
I cannot run away from my country.

45:37.640 --> 45:39.483
I cannot

45:41.840 --> 45:44.923
do something illegal.

45:45.960 --> 45:49.220
When I get back,
I called a press conference.

45:49.320 --> 45:52.820
And I said, "I'm never going to play
for the Tikhonov team anymore.

45:52.920 --> 45:54.524
"Because they cheated me."

46:13.840 --> 46:17.420
The day his article went out,

46:17.520 --> 46:21.286
our phone stopped ringing.

46:22.160 --> 46:25.420
People who we know stopped
talking to us.

46:25.520 --> 46:28.603
The sports facilities in the country,

46:28.720 --> 46:31.929
nobody let me in.

46:32.040 --> 46:35.500
You come there, the people know you,
they admire you.

46:35.600 --> 46:38.180
They put their head down and said,

46:38.280 --> 46:42.620
"No, Slava.
You cannot come and skate here.

46:42.720 --> 46:46.940
"No, if we let you skate,
they are going to kill me."

46:47.040 --> 46:50.260
Agents were placed
in their social circle

46:50.360 --> 46:55.780
so we could know
the situation from within.

46:55.880 --> 47:02.923
These people were just
pawns on a chess board.

47:06.080 --> 47:07.900
When you sit at home and you know

47:08.000 --> 47:12.483
some car is sitting down
near your entrance,

47:12.600 --> 47:14.700
and they're going to follow you,

47:14.800 --> 47:19.203
and they're going to try to listen. If you
meet someone, what do you talk about?

47:19.720 --> 47:21.802
What's the worst they could do?

47:23.200 --> 47:25.235
Anything.

47:27.336 --> 47:31.660
Anything. If they try to put Slava
in prison, what do you think?

47:31.760 --> 47:33.525
Did they do anything?

47:34.280 --> 47:36.286
In Kiev.

47:37.087 --> 47:39.180
In Kiev.

47:39.280 --> 47:40.920
What happened?

47:41.840 --> 47:43.604
What happened...

47:45.400 --> 47:50.884
They tried to put Slava in a car
and take him to the police station.

47:51.920 --> 47:57.700
They put the cuffs on him,
and cuffed him to the battery.

47:57.800 --> 48:01.540
And they just beat him up
until four o'clock in the morning.

48:01.640 --> 48:05.611
When they called Tikhonov,
and Tikhonov came and picked him up.

48:06.120 --> 48:08.780
That's when we heard
when Tikhonov was screaming,

48:08.880 --> 48:10.900
"Do anything, just put him in prison.

48:11.000 --> 48:16.291
"Just don't let him out of the country."

49:10.560 --> 49:14.485
If Slava will not be included on the team,
what will be your next move?

49:14.960 --> 49:18.060
Most likely, we'll all refuse to participate
in the world championship.

49:18.160 --> 49:20.740
You are three. Who else will join you?

49:20.840 --> 49:24.460
There are others who will support us.

49:24.560 --> 49:26.380
Krutov stood up for me,

49:26.480 --> 49:30.780
with my teammates Makarov and Larionov.

49:30.880 --> 49:33.884
Krutov has always been quiet.

49:34.600 --> 49:37.780
When you see the situation get crucial,

49:37.880 --> 49:39.370
he steps up.

49:41.680 --> 49:44.620
And from him, when he said something,

49:44.720 --> 49:50.011
it sounds different when you're not
talking all the time. It's very powerful.

49:51.520 --> 49:54.251
Do you mind, kind of,
just telling the story?

49:55.880 --> 49:57.660
It's very important
because it's a very personal...

49:57.760 --> 49:59.140
It was that.

49:59.240 --> 50:02.260
Slava was leaving.

50:02.360 --> 50:06.251
I stayed to play.

50:07.920 --> 50:09.340
It was a big surprise for me that

50:09.440 --> 50:13.684
Alex Kasatonov didn't go
with the boys on TV.

50:15.920 --> 50:18.420
You know, my best friend

50:18.520 --> 50:20.841
said, "No, I'm not going."

50:24.360 --> 50:27.443
So it was a big surprise.

50:29.360 --> 50:31.260
It's a very long story.

50:31.360 --> 50:33.283
Yeah, but you know...

50:33.560 --> 50:38.851
It's the story of our country, I think.

50:39.560 --> 50:45.567
He said publicly I wasn't
right to leave the team.

50:47.120 --> 50:52.020
He took the position of
Coach Tikhonov in this situation.

50:52.120 --> 50:54.202
That's the funniest part.

50:54.800 --> 50:59.283
You were best friends. I mean,
I want to know, kind of... You know...

50:59.880 --> 51:01.882
It's not the time.

51:02.760 --> 51:04.330
Sorry.

51:10.640 --> 51:12.290
To be continued.

51:18.520 --> 51:20.488
Next question.

51:31.160 --> 51:38.169
A special department was
created in the KGB.

51:43.960 --> 51:45.291
Do you want to say anything?

51:47.520 --> 51:49.740
Take your glasses off.

51:49.840 --> 51:52.380
You can't even see me in dark glasses.

51:52.480 --> 51:54.580
Come on, they are transparent.

51:54.680 --> 51:56.140
I can see you well.

51:56.240 --> 51:58.380
Look at the sun.

51:58.480 --> 52:00.020
I just did. I looked.

52:00.120 --> 52:02.380
I have sunglasses, too.

52:02.480 --> 52:04.260
They are white.

52:04.360 --> 52:06.203
Like this color white.

52:06.960 --> 52:08.450
Continue.

52:09.560 --> 52:10.891
Continue.

52:12.720 --> 52:15.724
When did things start to go wrong?

52:18.120 --> 52:20.620
Maybe it was

52:20.720 --> 52:22.961
the incident with Mogilny.

52:23.920 --> 52:26.180
Number 14 is Alexander Mogilny.

52:26.280 --> 52:27.580
Many NHL scouts say

52:27.680 --> 52:30.540
he is the best 19-year-old hockey player
in the world.

52:30.640 --> 52:34.486
I asked Mogilny if he would consider
playing in the National Hockey League.

52:35.720 --> 52:39.100
I'd like, but I suppose
that it's more interesting

52:39.200 --> 52:40.820
to play in the Soviet Union.

52:40.920 --> 52:44.660
All right, what if we offer you
a million dollars cash?

52:44.760 --> 52:46.649
Then would you come and play in the NHL?

52:51.560 --> 52:54.020
The Soviet team was over there
playing a tournament,

52:54.120 --> 52:57.380
and they wake up one morning,
and Mogilny was gone.

52:57.480 --> 52:59.500
His defection began with a phone call

52:59.600 --> 53:02.340
to the managers
of the NHL's Buffalo Sabres.

53:02.440 --> 53:03.940
Were you in Sweden to bring him out?

53:04.040 --> 53:06.900
No. What do you mean, was I
in Sweden to bring him out?

53:07.000 --> 53:08.968
I was in Sweden to meet him,
at his request.

53:16.280 --> 53:19.620
Mogilny was considered a traitor,

53:19.720 --> 53:21.961
especially because he was
in the Soviet Army.

53:24.240 --> 53:26.561
He escaped, as they say.

53:26.680 --> 53:28.020
But it was kind of...

53:28.120 --> 53:32.205
How do you say... Illegal.

53:32.440 --> 53:34.500
Here, people enjoy life.

53:34.600 --> 53:37.180
Everyone has their own home,
their own cars.

53:37.280 --> 53:39.820
But that's not the point.

53:39.920 --> 53:42.900
Here, people live for themselves.

53:43.000 --> 53:45.844
And there, I lived like a homeless dog.

53:50.560 --> 53:54.360
Why did the government care so much
if the hockey players defected?

53:56.400 --> 53:58.721
Well...

53:59.320 --> 54:01.607
It's difficult to speak
about hockey separately.

54:01.840 --> 54:04.060
It wouldn't be like,

54:04.160 --> 54:07.900
"Oh my God! Hockey players are leaving!"

54:08.000 --> 54:09.843
The regime wouldn't put it like that.

54:10.280 --> 54:15.180
One defection could lead to a wave.

54:15.280 --> 54:21.242
This was a big threat to Soviet power.

54:21.800 --> 54:27.091
Politically, every time
something like that happened,

54:27.200 --> 54:28.740
it was used in the media,

54:28.840 --> 54:31.660
so it was a victory for the West

54:31.760 --> 54:34.140
and a loss for the Soviet Union.

54:34.240 --> 54:37.300
Authorities in Soviet sports
and hockey authorities,

54:37.400 --> 54:41.300
they realized that it's much better
for themselves, for the system,

54:41.400 --> 54:45.420
to allow the players to go to the NHL

54:45.520 --> 54:48.220
without the opportunity to escape,

54:48.320 --> 54:51.210
just because it's damaged
the image of the country.

54:55.720 --> 54:57.220
Then they start to negotiate.

54:57.320 --> 55:01.820
They said, "Okay, it looks like the
high authority agreed to let you go.

55:01.920 --> 55:06.420
"But you have to understand.
You'll make $1000 a month.

55:06.520 --> 55:08.620
"Doesn't matter how much
is your contract.

55:08.720 --> 55:11.220
"You're gonna bring money
back to the embassy."

55:11.320 --> 55:13.971
I said, "No way. I'm not going.

55:14.080 --> 55:16.180
"I mean, are you crazy?"

55:16.280 --> 55:17.260
They said, "You crazy."

55:17.360 --> 55:19.380
I said, "Okay."

55:19.480 --> 55:22.380
They called me in a couple days
and said, "Slava,

55:22.480 --> 55:27.646
"you got special permission
from the Politburo.

55:27.760 --> 55:32.620
"Because you were so good for
hockey, for the national team,

55:32.720 --> 55:36.566
"and you were captain,
we'll give you 10% of your salary.

55:36.920 --> 55:42.051
"This is a special offer
made especially for you.

55:42.600 --> 55:45.660
"Nobody has to know about the 10%."

55:45.760 --> 55:47.728
I said, "No."

55:48.840 --> 55:50.820
Then it was 20%.

55:50.920 --> 55:54.660
Then it was 25%.

55:54.760 --> 55:58.287
They called my mom. They called my wife.
They tried to scare them.

55:59.080 --> 56:04.660
Momma said, "Son, the people called me.
They explained you got no chance.

56:04.760 --> 56:08.780
"They'll not let you go.
They'll make something bad for you.

56:08.880 --> 56:10.803
"You should not fight anymore."

56:11.560 --> 56:15.804
And Igor Larionov signed
a deal and left.

56:16.680 --> 56:18.780
The Russians are here.

56:18.880 --> 56:20.900
Igor Larionov, center,

56:21.000 --> 56:23.420
Vancouver, a playmaker.

56:23.520 --> 56:26.700
The NHL is paying
the Soviet Union to allow Igor

56:26.800 --> 56:29.326
and other Soviet veterans to play here.

56:29.520 --> 56:31.500
Soviet players in the NHL

56:31.600 --> 56:33.860
have to turn a large chunk
of their contract

56:33.960 --> 56:36.540
over to their cash-starved country.

56:36.640 --> 56:39.325
But to the Larionovs, it's worth it.

56:39.440 --> 56:42.420
In Moscow, things were
completely different.

56:42.520 --> 56:45.330
If they lost, he would not
be allowed to come home.

56:46.320 --> 56:49.380
He was happy with a 50/50
split with the system.

56:49.480 --> 56:50.420
Who, Igor?

56:50.520 --> 56:52.700
Igor, and Sergei and Vladimir.

56:52.800 --> 56:56.122
They was happy to split 50/50.

56:56.800 --> 56:59.087
I said, "No."

57:02.840 --> 57:04.683
And I was alone.

57:14.120 --> 57:17.100
They said, "What do you want?"

57:17.200 --> 57:19.260
I said, "I want my contract."

57:19.360 --> 57:21.460
The problem is
that this defenseman's life

57:21.560 --> 57:23.980
is controlled
by the Soviet Defense Ministry.

57:24.080 --> 57:28.324
Fetisov is an officer in the army
and plays for its top team.

57:28.640 --> 57:31.460
The team is cleared.
Tikhonov has cleared it.

57:31.560 --> 57:34.609
And all they're waiting for
is the Minister of Defense.

57:34.720 --> 57:36.940
Yazov. Dmitry Yazov.

57:37.040 --> 57:38.740
The Minister of Defense.

57:38.840 --> 57:41.650
The second most powerful man
in the country.

57:43.200 --> 57:46.620
They called me
to the Ministry of Defense.

57:46.720 --> 57:49.140
Tried to straighten me out.

57:49.240 --> 57:51.420
They put my uniform on me.

57:51.520 --> 57:54.490
It was a huge, huge office.

57:55.560 --> 57:59.140
He said, "America? This is my enemy.

57:59.240 --> 58:01.620
"No way you're going to America."

58:01.720 --> 58:03.020
He said, "You don't wanna play?

58:03.120 --> 58:08.365
"You're not gonna play
anymore, anywhere, anyhow."

58:10.240 --> 58:13.100
Something clicked inside of me.
I have to do something.

58:13.200 --> 58:18.420
I have to provoke some result
out of this visit.

58:18.520 --> 58:21.180
Because I knew I'd never get back here.

58:21.280 --> 58:23.408
Never.

58:23.520 --> 58:24.567
Ever.

58:25.880 --> 58:28.060
I said, "Mr. Minister,

58:28.160 --> 58:32.780
"if you don't do what you promised to me,
you're not a Minister. You're not an officer.

58:32.880 --> 58:35.008
"Release me from the army.

58:35.600 --> 58:36.660
"Thank you very much."

58:36.760 --> 58:39.286
I turn and go.

58:39.440 --> 58:41.010
He was screaming, yelling.

58:41.120 --> 58:45.020
"You ....sucker.
You try to play for our enemies?

58:45.120 --> 58:48.203
"You know what I can do with you? I'll send
you to Siberia. You'll never get out."

58:49.760 --> 58:52.260
But I never turned back.

58:52.360 --> 58:53.441
I left.

58:54.360 --> 58:56.340
You know what?

58:56.440 --> 58:58.568
In ten days, they give me a passport.

58:58.680 --> 59:00.340
And I was free of the Army.

59:00.440 --> 59:05.128
The first multiple working entrance
visa to United States.

59:10.640 --> 59:12.563
Wait a second. Go back.

59:15.640 --> 59:18.962
I don't get why Yazov let you leave
if he was mad at you.

59:19.960 --> 59:22.540
I'm not a historian.

59:22.640 --> 59:25.860
My feeling was the country
tried to change

59:25.960 --> 59:30.100
something because it's Perestroika time.

59:30.200 --> 59:32.260
But he doesn't want changes.

59:32.360 --> 59:37.540
Everybody was afraid.
It's understandable.

59:37.640 --> 59:40.180
It's like in a dark room,

59:40.280 --> 59:42.220
try to find a dark cat.

59:42.320 --> 59:45.688
You know, it's not funny.

59:47.800 --> 59:49.290
Okay.

59:54.360 --> 01:00:00.083
You'll go play our nation's hockey.

01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:02.680
Skillful and effective hockey.

01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:05.163
You'll be great.

01:00:21.080 --> 01:00:23.651
Coach's Corner with Don Cherry.

01:00:25.640 --> 01:00:27.660
You look happy. What's the matter?

01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:31.500
You know, I was gonna come on here
and be a good guy, you know, right?

01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:35.940
The first show, don't talk about the Russians,
and you know, and all that stuff.

01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:39.300
And be all, you know, I go,
"We'll let them come over here." No way!

01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:40.820
I don't want them here!

01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:42.540
The players don't want them here.

01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:44.620
And you're gonna be sorry
they're over here.

01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:46.740
Nobody like me in the United States.

01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:49.780
Nobody knew what I went through.

01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:51.580
They would think in clichés.

01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:53.660
I'm a bad guy, a communist.

01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:56.140
They talk about the Soviets
coming over and play here.

01:00:56.240 --> 01:00:57.940
Would some of the players be
a little upset about that?

01:00:58.040 --> 01:01:00.740
It would be a touchy situation,
you know,

01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:04.980
because you don't like to see
players on your team lose jobs,

01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:08.004
and if they come, there's gonna
be two less spots in the lineup.

01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:11.860
A shot taken by Clark on Fetisov,

01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:14.220
who's not retaliating.

01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:16.980
Fetisov looks like,
"You can't be doing this."

01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:20.084
Kind of disbelief when Clark
started swinging at him.

01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:22.603
Let's take a look at it again.

01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:27.340
When I walk in the wives' lounge,
it was like

01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:28.820
I was staying in one corner,

01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:31.620
and the rest were staying
in the other corner.

01:01:31.720 --> 01:01:36.100
And was looking at me,
and talking in their own language.

01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:38.860
I understand nothing
they're talking about.

01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:39.900
Looking at me again.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:41.340
Laughing and looking and talking.

01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:43.100
And I think,
"What are they talking about?"

01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:44.201
I have no idea.

01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:48.980
The coach hate Russians.
See it when he look at you, he hate you.

01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:51.700
How you gonna play for the guy
who hate you

01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:53.740
because you're a Soviet?

01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:57.700
Hockey over here
was a more brutal form of the game

01:01:57.800 --> 01:01:59.040
with elbows...

01:02:03.360 --> 01:02:06.409
Sticks high, and individualistic play.

01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:09.003
There was no style.

01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:12.369
They're so simple.

01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:15.060
They're not creative.

01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:17.700
It was the worst team in the league.

01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:20.500
Somebody gets open
and they skate away from you.

01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:22.540
And you end up on your ass.

01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:25.530
They look at you like
you never played before.

01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:29.140
Life challenged me all the time.

01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:32.449
All of a sudden, he was drafted
by the New Jersey Devils.

01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:34.340
...there, Kasatonov.

01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:37.940
Kasatonov, he's a little overshadowed,
I think, by Fetisov.

01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:40.281
He's a great hockey player.

01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:44.041
Did you tell the coaches, like,
"Listen, I can't play with this guy.

01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:46.367
"I mean, I just can't."

01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:50.460
Nobody gave a shit
about our relationship.

01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:52.164
They sign him. We have to play.

01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:57.260
It wasn't friendship anymore.
It wasn't team spirit.

01:02:57.360 --> 01:02:59.380
It was kind of competition.

01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:02.086
It was tough, trust me.

01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:04.060
Fetisov and Kasatonov,

01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:07.369
best friends off the ice,
defensive partners on the ice.

01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:13.740
I came to the United States
to play the hockey game.

01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:15.968
Not to be involved in this bullshit.

01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:18.700
Welcome to the big leagues, Vladimir.

01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:20.940
Krutov hit hard! Down he goes.

01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:23.860
The Soviets in the big league
have been having trouble.

01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:25.700
They're too old or too slow.

01:03:25.800 --> 01:03:29.300
They're too confused out there,
and they tend to get too fancy.

01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:31.420
They tend to pass
when they should shoot,

01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:33.887
and it gets the natives restless.

01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:37.211
They're not here for the Bolshoi Ballet.

01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:42.860
It's a completely new experience for me

01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:44.962
to play on a losing team.

01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:48.969
I ask the fans to be patient.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:56.402
It didn't work out for me,
staying in the NHL.

01:03:58.080 --> 01:04:00.740
But that's okay, I think.

01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:06.802
All in all, my life worked out.
I think everything's okay.

01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:13.220
When you come from a system

01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:16.540
where everything is regimented
every day of your life,

01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:18.700
and it was for these hockey players,

01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:20.380
and then you're...

01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:22.340
You go to a completely
different environment

01:04:22.440 --> 01:04:25.420
where you're supposed
to be able to organize

01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:29.241
and run your own life,
you become sort of lost.

01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:37.849
I was 36.

01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:42.460
And they trade me from
New Jersey to Detroit.

01:04:42.560 --> 01:04:45.020
Do you miss Larionov, Krutov, Makarov?

01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:46.380
Of course.

01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:49.211
We spent so many years
playing and living together.

01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:55.123
You miss the ones you're close to.

01:04:55.480 --> 01:04:58.540
I think, "Oh my God.
I did something wrong.

01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:01.300
"You've been successful.
You've always been on top.

01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:03.641
"Now you're a loser?"

01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:06.481
Do you feel that the game
is more fun here?

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:15.380
I get out of the dressing room
and see my wife by herself.

01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:17.580
Crying.

01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:19.380
I said, "Why are you crying?"

01:05:19.480 --> 01:05:24.420
She said, "Oh, we got probably
our last chance."

01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:27.900
I said, "No."

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:29.580
We've got two choices:

01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:31.700
To pack the stuff, go back

01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:33.450
or to fight through.

01:05:48.840 --> 01:05:52.640
Soviet Army tanks in their hundreds
moved onto the streets of Moscow,

01:05:52.760 --> 01:05:55.923
but the takeover has not gone
ahead without resistance.

01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:03.780
...was something that
certainly wasn't anticipated

01:06:03.880 --> 01:06:05.370
in this form, this quickly.

01:06:05.480 --> 01:06:08.460
The extent of the changes
and the immediacy of them

01:06:08.560 --> 01:06:10.403
certainly were not anticipated.

01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:24.444
I hereby resign my post
as President of the USSR.

01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:31.724
An end has been put to the
Cold War and the arms race,

01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:34.650
and the mad militarization
of this country.

01:06:34.760 --> 01:06:37.809
The threat of nuclear war is over.

01:06:52.080 --> 01:06:55.801
I wish everyone all the best.

01:06:59.840 --> 01:07:04.020
I knew how good they were.
I mean, I had watched them play.

01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:06.180
Bobby, the Soviets,
they never stop skating.

01:07:06.280 --> 01:07:07.850
There is constant motion.

01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:11.540
Their style of hockey
bothered our goalies and our defensemen,

01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:14.500
because, you know, you get in tune
to playing a certain way,

01:07:14.600 --> 01:07:17.604
and then all of a sudden,
the opposition does something different.

01:07:18.360 --> 01:07:20.966
The Canadians are getting caught up
in the Soviet vortex.

01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:27.500
We initially had three
that came out about the same time,

01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:29.620
Konstantinov, Fedorov and Kozlov.

01:07:29.720 --> 01:07:32.140
We were able to make a trade
and get Igor Larionov.

01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:35.500
And once we got the fourth member
of the Russians,

01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:37.820
we said, "Let's go and get one more."

01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:41.260
We needed a defenseman,
and we got Slava Fetisov.

01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:43.488
He was about 37 or 38.

01:07:44.680 --> 01:07:46.842
You could say we took a chance with him.

01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:50.340
When they got together

01:07:50.440 --> 01:07:53.820
and they designed
their own type of plays,

01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:56.048
we were surprised ourselves.

01:07:56.160 --> 01:07:58.527
And the Soviet symphony is tuning up.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:11.860
They crisscrossed a lot.

01:08:11.960 --> 01:08:14.980
And they made a lot of passes
in their own zone.

01:08:15.080 --> 01:08:16.939
If they don't see
an opportunity to score,

01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:20.680
they turn back with the puck
and develop another attack.

01:08:21.439 --> 01:08:23.841
They played a totally different style.

01:08:27.399 --> 01:08:29.420
Together again on the same team.

01:08:29.520 --> 01:08:32.091
It was like a fish put back
in the water.

01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:36.691
You never know what they'll do next.

01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:45.523
You become younger right away,
and enjoy the game.

01:08:50.479 --> 01:08:54.121
Around the arena, Russian often seems
like a second language.

01:09:00.040 --> 01:09:01.724
A lot of people complain about it.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:07.620
To me, see, I don't...
They're playing for us, and they're good.

01:09:07.720 --> 01:09:09.768
No, sir! And he gets leveled by Fetisov.

01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:21.220
I didn't really get to learn the system
as much as I would have liked,

01:09:21.319 --> 01:09:24.290
but I just let them do
what they wanted to do.

01:09:25.319 --> 01:09:27.220
Scotty comes to the dressing room
and said,

01:09:27.319 --> 01:09:30.300
"Guys, I don't know who teach you
to play this way,

01:09:30.399 --> 01:09:33.819
"but I wanna ask you one thing.

01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:36.446
"Don't change anything."

01:09:40.120 --> 01:09:42.282
...on game one
of the Stanley Cup Finals...

01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:32.380
I start looking for Igor right away.

01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:34.881
And I said, "Igor, we'll go together."

01:10:58.680 --> 01:11:01.365
It's true American dream, you know?

01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:11.050
Afterwards, I went to Gary Bettman.
I said, "Gary, I need the cup in Moscow."

01:11:11.160 --> 01:11:13.580
He said, "You crazy? We'll never
let the cup go to Moscow.

01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:16.260
"It's mafia. It's a bad country."

01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:19.250
I said, "Listen, I want the cup
to be in Moscow."

01:11:21.040 --> 01:11:22.180
He said, "Slava, it's impossible."

01:11:22.280 --> 01:11:25.443
I said, "What do you mean impossible?"

01:11:31.560 --> 01:11:34.260
It's great to be home.

01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:37.460
For me, the Red Army Club
is home, of course.

01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:40.620
I started here when I was 8 years old,

01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:43.166
and I left when I was 31.

01:11:44.360 --> 01:11:45.780
It's very strange.

01:11:45.880 --> 01:11:47.540
When you're born in the Soviet Union,

01:11:47.640 --> 01:11:50.928
and you left one country
and come back to another.

01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:55.244
It does not feel comfortable, you know?

01:11:57.040 --> 01:11:59.780
When I get back to Moscow,

01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:02.140
it's totally different.

01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:03.620
Different mentality.

01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:05.420
Different culture.

01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:07.568
Different... Everything's different.

01:12:07.880 --> 01:12:10.940
That capitalism has taken root here
is no longer in doubt,

01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:13.620
and some people are making
a great deal of money.

01:12:13.720 --> 01:12:16.140
But some of the problems
may be getting worse.

01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:17.940
In Moscow and Leningrad,

01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:20.860
many are turning their hand
at making a fast buck.

01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:22.980
Operating outside the legal boundaries

01:12:23.080 --> 01:12:25.811
is often more effective
than operating within them.

01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:31.180
Russians don't like
the corruption in this country.

01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:34.460
They feel that they're
not protected by the courts.

01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:37.260
They feel that the police,
just regular police,

01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:39.442
can pretty much do
what they want with you.

01:12:40.720 --> 01:12:42.620
Country's got no heroes. Got no system.

01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:45.020
No structure. Nothing.

01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:47.180
Everybody runs around
trying to get something.

01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:50.860
It's not the way I want to live.

01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:54.089
Everything is about the material
side of things: money, finance.

01:12:55.960 --> 01:12:59.020
Our country's crisis
is now reflected in hockey.

01:12:59.120 --> 01:13:02.260
With the first selection,
the Atlanta Thrashers

01:13:02.360 --> 01:13:05.330
are pleased to select,
from the Russian Division I,

01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:07.540
Spartak Moscow...

01:13:07.640 --> 01:13:08.700
Ilya Kovalchuk.

01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:10.020
Nail Yakupov.

01:13:10.120 --> 01:13:11.804
Alexander Ovechkin.

01:13:12.640 --> 01:13:18.602
Teams have very little money to
keep players from leaving.

01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:22.080
Yo, it's Alexander Ovechkin.
I am going to red carpet.

01:13:28.440 --> 01:13:31.683
We kinda forget about the patriotism.

01:13:31.800 --> 01:13:34.167
We are ashamed of what we were before.

01:13:34.360 --> 01:13:37.220
We are gonna test
Alexander Ovechkin's shooting accuracy

01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:40.260
by filling up these Russian dolls
with Russian dressing,

01:13:40.360 --> 01:13:42.249
and he's gonna drill them
with these hockey pucks.

01:13:45.640 --> 01:13:48.086
We lost something.

01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:52.961
We lost our pride.

01:13:54.960 --> 01:13:56.860
We lost...

01:13:56.960 --> 01:13:59.440
Our soul.

01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:04.620
But would you rather
it be the Soviet Union again?

01:14:04.720 --> 01:14:07.420
You know, like, would you have rather

01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:10.683
that not happened,
even though you kind of left?

01:14:14.360 --> 01:14:17.620
Gabe...

01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:20.260
It's not a proper question.

01:14:20.360 --> 01:14:21.820
I'm a politician now.

01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:25.940
I get my feeling
twenty years ago, right?

01:14:26.040 --> 01:14:27.580
I was sad.

01:14:27.680 --> 01:14:29.700
I played for the country for many years.

01:14:29.800 --> 01:14:32.770
I was proud to play and
be captain of the national team.

01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:40.260
When Putin invited me it was 2002.

01:14:40.360 --> 01:14:44.046
It's 11 years it's no Soviet Union.

01:14:45.720 --> 01:14:48.291
President Putin said,
"Slava, it's enough.

01:14:48.920 --> 01:14:51.605
"Get back home."

01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:04.324
Vladimir Putin gave me the position
of Minister of Sport.

01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:09.521
Sport should be a way of life.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:18.005
I'm a little guy in a big system,
but I try to do my best.

01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:21.660
The people who are running this country,

01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:25.140
born in the Soviet Union,
went to Soviet schools,

01:15:25.240 --> 01:15:26.740
were members of the Komsomol.

01:15:26.840 --> 01:15:30.020
They were created, shaped,
by the Soviet system.

01:15:30.120 --> 01:15:31.610
That's who they are.

01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:36.846
Much of the problems are still anchored
in that past.

01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:40.330
And they're not gonna go away...
Like this.

01:15:42.600 --> 01:15:45.300
It's a huge amount of work.

01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:48.847
It's twenty hours working day.
Every day.

01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:56.740
Y'know, we got lots of problems.

01:15:56.840 --> 01:15:58.540
I need to build infrastructure.

01:15:58.640 --> 01:15:59.780
I need to find the money.

01:15:59.880 --> 01:16:02.740
I need to think about my people now.

01:16:02.840 --> 01:16:04.780
The kids, the veterans...

01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:08.726
Try to build something good
out of what's happened.

01:16:11.920 --> 01:16:14.321
We built a junior league.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:18.641
We built 300 new skating arenas.

01:16:20.160 --> 01:16:24.643
We brought the Olympic Games to Sochi.

01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:35.721
We are happy to be back in our country.

01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:40.330
I think our country and people need us.

01:16:55.040 --> 01:16:56.940
We went through a lot,

01:16:57.040 --> 01:17:00.100
and I'm happy today we are
again like brothers.

01:17:00.200 --> 01:17:02.521
Very close friends.

01:17:04.240 --> 01:17:06.740
We're friends.

01:17:06.840 --> 01:17:12.722
It's very important to get the people
you went through a lot with next to you.

01:17:13.200 --> 01:17:15.646
It's better than finding somebody else.

01:17:19.480 --> 01:17:21.580
We're still friends.

01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:23.409
And when we played, we were even closer.

01:17:25.320 --> 01:17:29.120
I dream about how we
used to play together.

01:18:14.480 --> 01:18:19.327
First, a round of applause
for this great Soviet coach.

01:18:19.840 --> 01:18:23.860
The word "great" hardly begins
to describe this great coach!

01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:28.124
Unfortunately, Viktor says
he's unable to talk today.

01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:49.700
The most important thing for me

01:18:49.800 --> 01:18:53.020
is to stress to the kids how it's
important to be teammates.

01:18:53.120 --> 01:18:55.140
How important to do stuff collectively.

01:18:55.240 --> 01:18:58.562
To be proud of what team you play on.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.241
I played 23 professional years.

01:19:32.480 --> 01:19:36.485
One thousand eight hundred plus games.

01:19:37.520 --> 01:19:43.368
I never had fun more than
playing with those five guys, together.

01:19:51.080 --> 01:19:53.321
When you die,
this is gonna be your legacy.

01:19:53.640 --> 01:19:56.260
I know and I appreciate it.
You're a good guy.

01:19:56.360 --> 01:19:59.220
I'm lucky to have you.

01:19:59.320 --> 01:20:02.660
I think we're both lucky
to have each other.

01:20:02.760 --> 01:20:05.206
That's even better.

01:20:14.320 --> 01:20:16.368
California boy, and a good guy.

01:20:17.560 --> 01:20:18.766
Chicago.
