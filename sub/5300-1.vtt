04:16.005 --> 04:19.927
You got maybe seven minutes.

04:45.410 --> 04:46.578
Six minutes.

05:12.020 --> 05:13.564
Almost got one
of the fuses fixed.

06:09.369 --> 06:11.371
Thirty seconds.

06:25.135 --> 06:27.513
Get out now.

08:49.738 --> 08:53.825
Yeah.
It's Duncan.
What are you doing at home?

08:53.909 --> 08:57.371
- Jogging.
- How long does it take you
to get to work?

08:57.454 --> 08:59.706
Harry, what time is it there?
How long?

08:59.790 --> 09:03.210
Thirty, 40 minutes. Why?
I'll give you 25 minutes...

09:03.293 --> 09:07.089
before I transmit, if you want
to see the cable before they do,

09:07.172 --> 09:09.049
you'd better hustle.

09:33.156 --> 09:35.534
Duncan.
What the hell's goin' on?

09:35.617 --> 09:38.412
Read the cable.
Look, if I'm walking
into a shitstorm,

09:38.495 --> 09:40.414
I've gotta know which way
the wind's blowing.

09:41.665 --> 09:44.585
Boy Scout's in trouble.
What kind of trouble?

09:44.668 --> 09:47.129
Where are you calling from?

09:49.131 --> 09:52.050
Are you in your car?
Are you out of
your fucking mind?

09:52.134 --> 09:54.219
He's a big boy.
He can take care
of himself.

09:54.303 --> 09:56.680
You call me from secure
when you get there.

10:23.790 --> 10:25.959
Let's see
your driver's license.

10:50.817 --> 10:53.237
Sorry, sir.

10:53.320 --> 10:55.948
You need to come
to the desk with me, please.

10:56.031 --> 10:58.450
Mr. Muir.

11:01.245 --> 11:03.497
Duty roster has you
checking out tonight.

11:03.580 --> 11:05.833
Just a reminder:
on your way out,

11:05.916 --> 11:08.085
we need to sign out
your I.D., card key,
parking pass.

11:08.168 --> 11:10.003
It's a date.

11:22.057 --> 11:24.726
You got a cable
from Hong Kong?

11:24.810 --> 11:26.937
You check
the operations center?

11:27.020 --> 11:29.106
I go up there, Billy Nyland's
gonna want to collect...

11:29.189 --> 11:31.358
that hundred I owe him
from the 'Skins game.

11:31.441 --> 11:34.653
Come on, Henry.
Pull it off the mainframe
for me, will you?

11:34.736 --> 11:36.697
My last day.

11:59.803 --> 12:02.264
Gladys.

12:07.561 --> 12:09.021
Cubans are in
the drawer on the left.

12:14.735 --> 12:19.573
If these walls could talk, huh?
All this history. I envy you.

12:21.116 --> 12:24.745
Bag your job.
You can be just like me.
No, really.

12:24.828 --> 12:26.497
The debt this country
owes you guys.

12:26.580 --> 12:28.874
Chuck, are we gonna
dance all night with
your hand on my ass,

12:28.957 --> 12:31.710
or are you gonna
make your move?

12:31.793 --> 12:34.755
You used to run
an agent named Bishop.

12:34.838 --> 12:37.591
Tom Bishop. Yeah. How is he?
We'd like to take a look at his files.

12:37.674 --> 12:39.551
Did you try Records?

12:39.635 --> 12:43.180
Of course, we have his main files.
It was your personals.

12:43.263 --> 12:47.351
What do you want to know?
We'll have your Bishop
op reports downloaded...

12:47.434 --> 12:50.604
and sorted in an hour or two;
for now, I'll just take your files.

12:52.064 --> 12:54.733
Grab yourself a seat and
make yourself comfortable.

12:54.816 --> 12:58.195
It's gonna take me a while
to dig 'em up.

12:58.278 --> 13:00.197
Call my office as soon as
you have 'em. ASAP.

13:00.280 --> 13:01.698
Oh, Muir?

13:01.782 --> 13:03.492
Good luck
with the retirement.

13:42.364 --> 13:46.827
The director sent this down.
Actually, it looks like
he signed it himself.

13:51.415 --> 13:55.669
Oh, and Harker said
I?m supposed to collect
all your files on Tom Bishop.

14:05.345 --> 14:07.639
Finally get to use
one of these burn bags.

14:11.852 --> 14:14.104
Hold this, till
you hear otherwise.

14:14.188 --> 14:18.483
You didn't see what I put in.
Are we feeling a little
paranoid on our last day?

14:18.567 --> 14:22.196
When did Noah
build the ark, Gladys?

14:22.279 --> 14:25.449
Before the rain.
Before the rain.

14:38.128 --> 14:41.340
Hey, Billy,
you got my hundred?

14:47.804 --> 14:50.682
Harker said to bring
this file up. You want
to buzz me through?

14:50.766 --> 14:53.602
No, I can't, sir.
But I'll make sure
he gets it.

14:53.685 --> 14:56.647
Sir?

15:03.570 --> 15:06.865
Can you get that
Chinese translator?

15:14.039 --> 15:16.625
No, that looks
pretty good.

15:16.708 --> 15:19.878
Looks good.
...as for the upcoming trade
negotiations in the Far East,

15:19.962 --> 15:22.923
a team of negotiators has been
working with the Chinese...

15:23.006 --> 15:24.925
in an effort to streamline
the proceedings...

15:25.008 --> 15:27.177
and lay the groundwork for
the President's trip next week.

15:27.261 --> 15:29.096
In other world news...
Jeez.

15:29.179 --> 15:32.683
now that the Cold War
is finally over, Berliners
are proclaiming a new era...

15:32.766 --> 15:35.519
here where
Soviet and American tanks
faced each other...

15:35.602 --> 15:37.271
in the darkest days
of the Communist...

15:38.897 --> 15:41.650
Is this it?
It's all I could find.

15:41.733 --> 15:45.237
Packed, misplaced you know how it is.
Moving day and all.

15:45.320 --> 15:48.240
It's probably
mostly up here anyway.

15:48.323 --> 15:50.367
Old school,
you know?

15:53.078 --> 15:55.789
Muir?

15:57.541 --> 15:59.209
Step this way?

16:04.923 --> 16:06.633
Sit down here, please,
Muir?

16:07.718 --> 16:10.304
Jesus, Aiken.
How long has it been?

16:15.017 --> 16:17.227
This task force
have a name?

16:22.941 --> 16:25.444
This is a tough one, Troy.

16:27.321 --> 16:29.239
I'm gonna
see you later.

16:29.323 --> 16:31.909
You got it, Cy.

16:43.128 --> 16:46.924
Good to see you.
Thanks for stoppin' by.

16:47.007 --> 16:49.176
For the record, we've
been joined by Nathan Muir,
Near East ops.

16:51.553 --> 16:53.472
We're in the process
of dealing...

16:53.555 --> 16:56.725
with a fairly specific...

16:56.808 --> 16:59.394
international flap.

16:59.478 --> 17:01.855
We brought you in here
as a stopgap.

17:01.939 --> 17:05.275
Fill in a few holes for us.
So I'm like
the little Dutch boy, huh?

17:05.358 --> 17:06.902
Yeah!

17:06.984 --> 17:09.738
We just need you
to be a team player
on this one, Muir.

17:09.820 --> 17:12.741
Why is that funny?

17:12.824 --> 17:16.118
Every time my coach
told me that, I knew
I was about to get benched.

17:19.414 --> 17:21.875
Due to the nature
of this task force, Nathan,

17:21.959 --> 17:25.378
there will be
certain information which
you don't need to know.

17:25.462 --> 17:29.049
A week ago, Tom Bishop
disappeared in Hong Kong.

17:29.132 --> 17:31.760
Last night he turned up
outside Shanghai.

17:31.844 --> 17:35.764
He's been arrested
for espionage.

17:35.848 --> 17:40.227
We're working up a profile
based on relevant personal
histories and op records.

17:40.310 --> 17:44.314
This has to be handled
with kid gloves.

17:44.398 --> 17:46.733
How long does the president
have to claim him?

17:46.817 --> 17:48.944
Twenty-four hours.
Starting when?

17:49.027 --> 17:50.821
As of now, Nathan.

17:53.490 --> 17:57.327
Bishop has been classified
as a common criminal,

17:57.411 --> 18:00.873
and will be executed
at 8:00 A.M. tomorrow
morning, our time.

18:03.292 --> 18:06.628
What about the press?

18:06.712 --> 18:09.798
Why not leak it and throw
the spotlight on China,
and buy us some time?

18:09.882 --> 18:12.718
We need the press on this
like we need a third teat.

18:15.053 --> 18:17.598
You using the other two?

18:17.681 --> 18:21.351
We don't want outside influences
to... limit our options.

18:22.603 --> 18:24.521
What was Bishop
doing in China?

18:24.605 --> 18:26.815
He was with an operation
for Harry Duncan.

18:26.899 --> 18:28.817
Was?
Yes.

18:28.901 --> 18:30.986
Until he took matters
into his own hands.

18:31.069 --> 18:33.238
Well, where are they
holding him?

18:33.322 --> 18:37.367
Oh, I'm sorry, Nathan.
It would be nice to know
what gaps are filled.

18:37.451 --> 18:38.869
I've only got ten fingers
here, you know?

18:44.583 --> 18:45.667
I guess, kind of
tough timing, hmm?

18:45.751 --> 18:47.336
A week before
the president's road trip.

18:47.419 --> 18:51.089
You guys afraid there's gonna
be a congressional hearing?

18:54.343 --> 18:57.721
That's why we're transcribing
and videotaping. Right?

19:01.892 --> 19:03.769
Are you gonna
want me to testify?

19:05.062 --> 19:07.022
No.
No?

19:07.105 --> 19:08.982
Absolutely not.

19:11.818 --> 19:16.865
You met Bishop in Vietnam, right?
Yeah.

19:16.949 --> 19:20.160
Spring of'75.

19:20.244 --> 19:23.831
Hue had just fallen. Danang
would go in a couple of days.

19:23.914 --> 19:26.667
And I had flown in country
to get an ARVN sniper...

19:26.750 --> 19:29.545
who?d been with us
throughout the Phoenix program.

19:29.628 --> 19:32.631
He was a heavy hitter
named Binh.

19:47.646 --> 19:50.190
Spent the last year
Rocky Mountain way

19:52.359 --> 19:55.529
It's time to open fire

19:56.697 --> 19:59.575
And we don't need
the ladies

19:59.658 --> 20:03.662
Cryin' 'cause the story?s sad

20:05.372 --> 20:08.792
I got some bad news
for you, sir. he's dead.
Dead?

20:08.876 --> 20:13.255
Just before dawn.
Caught a mortar round
with his teeth.

20:13.338 --> 20:16.967
Got anybody else?
There's a staff sergeant
came my way a while back,

20:17.050 --> 20:19.469
but he's nowhere near
Binh's 40 confirmed.
How many has he got?

20:19.553 --> 20:22.431
Three kills.
Christ, and that's
the best you got?

20:22.514 --> 20:24.558
He's a fine shot, sir.

20:24.641 --> 20:26.602
Where is he?
Right over there.

20:29.188 --> 20:31.273
Where, in the back?
Yeah.

20:31.356 --> 20:35.027
There is another guy,
20 kills, but he's
at least two days away.

20:35.110 --> 20:37.571
Confirm that for me?
Yes, sir.

20:37.654 --> 20:39.573
Why ice over there?
They live separate...

20:39.656 --> 20:42.951
from the other men,
cook their own food-gook food.

20:44.703 --> 20:47.414
Smells awful, sir.

20:47.498 --> 20:50.042
Not to the enemy.
Send him in.

20:50.125 --> 20:51.919
Yes, sir.

21:01.637 --> 21:05.516
Yes, sir?
Bishop?

21:05.599 --> 21:07.184
That's correct, sir.

21:09.394 --> 21:12.231
Where are you from?
Hemet, California, sir.

21:12.314 --> 21:14.066
Here.
Have a seat.

21:19.905 --> 21:22.491
I take it you didn't get
to be a marksman putting food
on your mama's table.

21:22.574 --> 21:26.370
No, sir, we have
a Safeway back home.

21:26.453 --> 21:29.456
Where'd you learn
to shoot?
Boy Scouts, sir.

21:31.875 --> 21:34.753
Are you kiddin' me?
No, sir.

21:37.589 --> 21:39.633
When did you get
pulled in?
I volunteered, sir.

21:42.094 --> 21:44.805
He came across as one of
those idealistic types...

21:44.888 --> 21:46.932
you know, a little bit
of an attitude?

21:47.015 --> 21:49.768
Starts out trying
to see what he's made of, and
ends up not liking the view.

21:49.852 --> 21:55.107
Who was the target, Muir?
General Hun Chea.

21:55.190 --> 21:57.943
He's Laotian?
Yeah.
Unofficial enemy.

21:58.026 --> 22:00.779
Code name:
Red Shirt.

22:00.863 --> 22:03.782
He's responsible for
the western flank of
the upcoming Saigon offensive.

22:03.866 --> 22:05.868
His name...
Don't need
a name, sir.

22:05.951 --> 22:08.620
You don't need it?
Or you don't want it?

22:08.704 --> 22:12.040
Yeah, I'll do it, sir.

22:14.251 --> 22:17.296
Okay.

22:27.055 --> 22:29.141
The target will be
at a location...

22:29.224 --> 22:31.852
twenty-one clicks away,
tomorrow morning at 0900.

22:34.229 --> 22:36.315
It's a high-powered meet-and-greet
with the Vietcong.

22:42.821 --> 22:46.283
Will he be alone, sir?
He sometimes travels
with a bit of an entourage.

22:48.410 --> 22:50.537
''A bit of an entourage?''

23:01.423 --> 23:05.844
Red Shirt located.
Do you have in sight?
Red Shirt confirmed.

23:11.767 --> 23:14.394
Niner-eight-zero to gate.

23:19.733 --> 23:22.152
One-zero-zero-five
to table.

23:26.198 --> 23:28.408
Wind...

23:29.785 --> 23:31.745
five miles left.

23:34.623 --> 23:36.750
Target in sight.

23:50.722 --> 23:53.058
Bravo Six, Bravo Six.
Delta Two. Over.

23:53.141 --> 23:55.894
Go, Delta Two.
We have target in sight,
but no shot.

23:55.978 --> 23:59.064
Say again?
No shot.

23:59.147 --> 24:02.401
Helo is obstructing target.
Helo? NVA doesn't have air support.

24:02.484 --> 24:06.738
Position in jeopardy.
Our position is compromised.
Over.

24:06.822 --> 24:10.075
Say it again. Over?
Shh. We're still a go.

24:10.159 --> 24:12.953
We have no go.

24:14.204 --> 24:16.248
Clear.
Don't take the shot!

24:16.331 --> 24:18.417
See if you can
get 'em back.

24:18.500 --> 24:21.128
Delta Two, Delta Two...

24:24.256 --> 24:25.924
Move!

24:36.768 --> 24:39.646
Come on, come on.

25:00.125 --> 25:02.002
Delta Two, Delta Two.
Bravo Six, over.

26:32.801 --> 26:34.720
Sorry about your man,
Captain.

26:34.803 --> 26:37.598
You want to make
another pass, sir?

26:48.817 --> 26:53.071
Hold it.
Go back again.

27:10.589 --> 27:13.008
Hell of an ad
for the Boy Scouts.

27:18.388 --> 27:21.058
Did you have
a presidential finding
authorizing those kills?

27:27.898 --> 27:29.816
I don't believe
we've met.

27:29.900 --> 27:33.028
Who are you?
Dr. William Byars.

27:33.111 --> 27:34.738
National Security Council.

27:37.282 --> 27:40.536
Was there
a finding, Muir?

27:40.619 --> 27:43.288
Well, we were in a place
we weren't supposed to be,

27:43.372 --> 27:46.875
assassinating a general
from a country we weren't
at war with...

27:46.959 --> 27:50.087
of course, we weren't
officially at war
with North Vietnam, either...

27:50.170 --> 27:53.340
Is that a ''no''?
Oh, come on, guys.

27:53.423 --> 27:56.802
We're on the clock.
The president admits
Bishop is ours,

27:56.885 --> 28:01.056
denies he's a spy,
we put out the fires
and negotiate a deal.

28:01.139 --> 28:02.474
Unless I'm
missing something.

28:02.808 --> 28:04.518
Muir's secretary's on...

28:04.601 --> 28:08.897
Mm. This will just take a second.

28:08.981 --> 28:11.942
Stop recording.
Stop tape.

28:12.025 --> 28:15.237
Your secretary's got
your wife on the line.
She says it's urgent.

28:15.320 --> 28:18.115
Go ahead.
Want to take it outside?

28:18.198 --> 28:21.577
No, no.
I'll take it in here.
That's fine.

28:21.660 --> 28:27.332
Hello?
Got your message.
You want me to start a fire yet?

28:27.416 --> 28:31.086
Oh, uh, right.
This'll just take a second.

28:31.170 --> 28:34.715
Right.
Tell you what.

28:34.798 --> 28:37.926
Why don't you hold
that reservation, and, uh,

28:38.010 --> 28:39.803
we may still
be able to use it.

28:39.887 --> 28:42.514
You might just.
As we speak, there are
three guys rummaging...

28:42.598 --> 28:45.851
through everything
I spent a week packing.

28:45.934 --> 28:47.769
Uh-huh.

28:47.853 --> 28:49.479
Okay.

28:49.563 --> 28:51.190
Uh-huh.

28:51.273 --> 28:54.026
If there were any instances
of personal dysfunction,
Right.

28:54.109 --> 28:58.614
emotional or psychological,
it could be helpful.
Okay.

28:58.697 --> 29:00.782
it?s insubstantial.
Right.

29:00.866 --> 29:03.285
Mm-hmm. Okay.

29:03.368 --> 29:05.287
That'll be good.
Because presidential findings...

29:05.370 --> 29:07.956
have no real importance.
You still there?

29:08.040 --> 29:09.625
Y-Yeah.

29:09.708 --> 29:12.961
So he was an assassin,
recruited to kill.

29:14.046 --> 29:17.174
Sounds good.
Bye-bye.

29:20.761 --> 29:25.516
Sorry. Wife planning
a retirement dinner.

29:27.559 --> 29:29.269
Assassin?

29:33.982 --> 29:35.901
I think I just
figured it out.

29:37.402 --> 29:39.696
The Bishop files.
Where?

29:39.780 --> 29:42.407
My office.
Closet.

29:42.491 --> 29:44.827
It'll just
take a second.

29:44.910 --> 29:46.995
I'll send
a security officer down.
No, hey, you guys...

29:47.079 --> 29:51.542
have better things to do
than to rummage through
my office, right, Chuck?

30:01.260 --> 30:03.428
He's on his way down.

30:37.504 --> 30:40.591
You were right.

30:40.674 --> 30:42.718
It rained.

30:42.801 --> 30:45.137
What about these?

30:45.220 --> 30:49.558
Burn 'em.
What is this about?

30:49.641 --> 30:52.060
Money.

30:52.144 --> 30:54.062
Free trade. Microchips.

30:54.146 --> 30:56.732
Toaster ovens.

30:56.815 --> 30:58.817
And what does that
have to do with you?

31:01.486 --> 31:04.198
Nothing. Get me
Digger Gibson's number.

31:07.618 --> 31:09.536
Shit!

31:19.671 --> 31:24.009
Agency's looking for
a reason to let the Chinese
kill Tom Bishop.

31:41.193 --> 31:42.361
No!

31:50.619 --> 31:53.539
Ah, they shut down
my secure line...
last day and all.

31:53.622 --> 31:55.332
Can I use yours?
Thanks.
Aw, well...

31:55.415 --> 31:58.418
Oh, I'm sorry. It's classified.
Do you mind?

31:58.502 --> 32:00.671
Oh! Uh, right.

32:06.552 --> 32:08.595
There's nothing there.
It's not in English?

32:08.679 --> 32:11.598
It's not in English either.
This fax just came in
a few moments ago, sir.

32:11.682 --> 32:13.642
Yeah.

32:15.561 --> 32:19.940
So, sir, you and Muir
came up together, right?
Mm.

32:20.023 --> 32:23.318
How well do you know him?
No one knows Nathan.
Not really.

32:23.402 --> 32:27.114
Do you trust him?
He's a man who
got the job done.

32:27.197 --> 32:29.449
Is he on the job now?

32:29.533 --> 32:32.452
Office of Security, Hong Kong.
Ten to seven this morning,

32:32.536 --> 32:35.873
a call originated from
station to Muir's home.

32:37.875 --> 32:40.210
He knew about Bishop
before he got here.
And he played dumb.

32:40.294 --> 32:43.213
Yeah, this is Harker.
I need confirmation
on all calls...

32:43.297 --> 32:46.049
in and out of
Nathan Muir's office.

32:47.551 --> 32:50.345
Gee, I'm hungry.

32:50.429 --> 32:53.599
Hong Kong Herald.

32:53.682 --> 32:56.727
Digger Gibson, please.
One moment, sir.

32:58.854 --> 33:00.814
Hello?
Gibby, old boy.

33:00.898 --> 33:03.192
Nathan!
To what do I owe
this honour?

33:03.275 --> 33:05.194
Still have contacts at CNN?

33:05.277 --> 33:07.196
I got something for you.
Talk to me.

33:07.279 --> 33:11.325
How about
''C.I.A. operative caught
in the act of espionage''?

33:11.408 --> 33:14.620
Can you get that on the air?
That's not gonna be easy.

33:14.703 --> 33:16.788
Come on, Gibby.

33:16.872 --> 33:19.958
That's never stopped you before.

33:20.042 --> 33:22.085
Give me 30 minutes.
Yeah.

33:27.758 --> 33:30.969
I remember seeing
something about Bishop
in my South American box,

33:31.053 --> 33:32.971
but it wasn't there.

33:33.055 --> 33:36.475
Those op files
downloaded yet?

33:40.103 --> 33:43.941
Let's go with this.
Bishop's recruitment.
Yeah.

33:44.024 --> 33:47.152
Well, back then,
recruitment took time.

33:47.236 --> 33:50.823
Bishop was evacuated
with the last of them
on the 30th of April,

33:52.574 --> 33:55.202
and that gave me a month
to do my homework.

33:55.285 --> 33:58.455
I talked to his neighbours,
his teachers, his mom...

33:58.539 --> 34:01.124
scoutmaster...

34:01.208 --> 34:03.961
Pulled his dad's records
from the Pentagon.

34:04.044 --> 34:07.923
Then started to move
some pieces around
on the board.

34:08.005 --> 34:12.678
And my plan was
to isolate and alienate.

34:14.554 --> 34:17.683
Your valleys and your farms

34:17.766 --> 34:20.476
I had his C. O. give him
just menial duties...

34:20.561 --> 34:22.771
with non-English-speaking
personnel.

34:22.855 --> 34:26.108
And I kept him in limbo about
even the possibility of going home.

34:26.190 --> 34:29.862
And then I watched...
and waited.

34:29.945 --> 34:32.030
This consignment is
a complete misdirect.

34:32.114 --> 34:35.576
It needs to go to
Military H.Q in Mannheim.
You understand?

34:40.706 --> 34:44.001
Then, in December, when
I didn't think he could
take anymore,

34:44.083 --> 34:49.630
I made the move.
These mist-covered mountains

34:50.841 --> 34:55.137
Are a home now to me

34:55.219 --> 34:58.056
There she is.

34:58.140 --> 35:02.019
But my home is the lowlands

35:05.981 --> 35:08.609
Uh, sorry sir. It's Bishop.
Sergeant Bishop?

35:08.692 --> 35:10.652
Oh, Christ.
Of course!

35:10.736 --> 35:12.654
Hi.
Yeah, hi.

35:12.738 --> 35:14.740
Sandy, this is Tom Bishop.
Tom, right?

35:14.823 --> 35:17.075
Yes, sir. Tom, sir.
Tom. How are you?
Nice to meet you.

35:17.159 --> 35:19.203
Sandy?
My second wife.

35:19.286 --> 35:22.748
Second wife?
He asked me what
I was doing in Berlin,

35:22.831 --> 35:25.501
and I told him I was there
as a military liaison of a sort.

35:25.584 --> 35:29.421
It's good to hear an American
voice again, I'll tell you that.
I'll bet, I'll bet.

35:29.505 --> 35:31.882
What are you doing
for Christmas?

35:31.965 --> 35:34.301
No plans.

35:34.384 --> 35:38.138
Oh, the weather outside
is frightful

35:38.222 --> 35:40.390
But the fire is so delightful

35:46.855 --> 35:49.566
Central Intelligence?
Train you as an agent.

35:49.650 --> 35:51.568
You'd be working for me.
Mostly undercover.

35:54.822 --> 35:57.533
Europe?
Wherever the action is.

35:57.616 --> 36:00.327
What if I preferred...
to just go home?

36:00.410 --> 36:03.205
That's okay.
It's fine.

36:03.288 --> 36:06.708
I can probably make arrangements
for you to end your
tour of duty in San Diego.

36:06.792 --> 36:10.045
In which case,
I'll presume you'll forget
we ever had this conversation.

36:10.128 --> 36:14.049
But look,
it's your choice.

36:14.132 --> 36:17.094
All the way home
I'll be warm

36:17.177 --> 36:19.680
The next day,
we started his tradecraft.

36:19.763 --> 36:22.724
The technology
gets better every day,
and that's fine.

36:22.808 --> 36:26.603
But most of the time,
all you need is a stick of gum,
a pocket knife and a smile.

36:26.687 --> 36:28.772
That's disappointing.
Guten Morgen, meine Herren.

36:28.856 --> 36:31.817
Today we're going to be
discussing a radio set.

36:31.900 --> 36:35.612
Not just any radio set,
but a Russian radio set.

36:35.696 --> 36:40.784
Every building, every room,
every situation is a snapshot.

36:40.868 --> 36:44.830
While I'm sitting here talking
to you, I?m also checking
the room, memorizing it.

36:44.913 --> 36:47.791
The people.
What they're wearing.
Then I ask the question,

36:47.875 --> 36:50.627
''What's wrong with this
picture? Anything suspect?''

36:50.711 --> 36:53.046
You've gotta see it,
assess it and dismiss
most of it...

36:53.130 --> 36:56.216
without looking, without thinking.
Without thinking?

36:56.300 --> 36:57.968
It?s just like breathing.
You breathe, don't you?

37:02.139 --> 37:04.683
Always carry cigarettes
and a lighter too.
Great ice-breaker.

37:06.185 --> 37:08.187
Eine Kaffee, bitte.
Zwei.

37:08.270 --> 37:12.232
Okay, I want you to listen,
but I want your concentration
to be on something different.

37:12.316 --> 37:14.735
Anything else, so you
don't react. Understand?

37:14.818 --> 37:16.612
Yes.

37:16.695 --> 37:18.780
So when do I get
my first assignment?

37:18.864 --> 37:20.782
When I decide
you're ready.

37:20.866 --> 37:23.202
What is your name?
Michael Sandville.

37:24.828 --> 37:27.164
The suit in the kitchen.

37:27.247 --> 37:31.668
Threat?
Wait, how'd you see that? Ah!

37:34.588 --> 37:36.632
See that apartment building?
Yeah?

37:36.715 --> 37:39.092
Know anyone
who lives there?
No.

37:39.176 --> 37:42.429
Within five minutes,
I want to see you standing
on one of those balconies.

37:42.513 --> 37:44.473
Come on.

37:44.556 --> 37:47.184
Did you serve in Vietnam?
No, I did not.

37:47.267 --> 37:49.978
Favourite colour?
Why don't we discuss it over coffee?

37:50.062 --> 37:52.564
You just lost ten seconds.

37:59.947 --> 38:02.115
Solicit information
from someone.

38:04.785 --> 38:06.703
Gladly.

38:10.958 --> 38:12.876
The guy reading the menu.

38:12.960 --> 38:15.712
Don't look at him.

38:15.796 --> 38:18.090
He wasn't reading the menu.
He's not reading at all. Threat?

38:19.633 --> 38:21.802
Only to the hostess.

38:21.885 --> 38:24.388
You just gave her four pieces
of personal information...

38:24.471 --> 38:26.139
for one dubious,
impersonal fact.

38:26.223 --> 38:28.475
Just trying to find out
where she got that dress.

38:28.559 --> 38:30.185
Where are you from?
When's your birthday?

38:30.269 --> 38:32.646
You know everything
about me. I don't know
a thing about you.

38:33.897 --> 38:35.816
Okay, what did you tell her?

38:35.899 --> 38:37.734
One, you're straight.
Two, you're engaged.

38:37.818 --> 38:41.238
Three, tomorrow's your girl's
birthday, and four, you have
no taste in women's fashions.

38:41.321 --> 38:44.908
What if she
were an asset?

38:44.992 --> 38:48.954
You told her four lies
that now have to be true.
Okay.

39:13.353 --> 39:17.191
I thought spies drank martinis.
Scotch, never less
than 12 years old.

39:17.274 --> 39:19.776
Is that right?

39:19.860 --> 39:24.948
Agency rules?
My rules.

39:25.032 --> 39:27.618
All right, so what else?
What else do I need to know?

39:27.701 --> 39:31.788
Put away some money
so you can die someplace warm.

39:31.872 --> 39:35.959
Don't ever touch it.
Not for anyone. Ever.

39:36.043 --> 39:39.421
Okay.
Is that it?

39:43.300 --> 39:46.094
Don't ever risk your life
or your career for an asset.

39:47.304 --> 39:50.140
If it comes down to
you or them, send flowers.

39:53.018 --> 39:56.563
He was a natural.

39:56.647 --> 39:58.982
He could take an
East German who had
just come over the Wall,

39:59.066 --> 40:02.486
look him straight in the eye,
and ask him to go back...

40:02.569 --> 40:04.279
to the place he just fled
and spy for us.

40:11.370 --> 40:16.291
He got so good at it he could
close in a single afternoon,
send the guy out with a smile.

40:16.542 --> 40:21.255
Let me get this straight:
you allowed a contract agent
to develop assets?

40:21.338 --> 40:24.466
He was that good.
I thought he'd make
a fine case officer someday.

40:24.550 --> 40:27.052
Let's get on with it.
I'd like to hear whatever
you can offer about...

40:27.135 --> 40:30.389
Operation Rodeo.
Rodeo?

40:36.103 --> 40:39.523
Hold transcription, hold tape.
I'll be right back.

41:00.252 --> 41:03.005
You know, this would go
a lot faster, you guys,

41:03.088 --> 41:05.174
if you?d tell me
a little something
about the op.

41:05.257 --> 41:07.593
What's it called?
Sideshow?

41:08.677 --> 41:10.929
What about it?

41:13.098 --> 41:17.936
- How'd you come by this information?
- Just stuff we learn in the field.

41:23.275 --> 41:26.653
Sorry about that.
Okay, where were we?

41:26.737 --> 41:28.530
I think we were
talking about...

41:28.614 --> 41:30.866
Operation Rodeo...
right, Chuck?

41:32.826 --> 41:34.703
You're on.

41:34.786 --> 41:38.081
My East German contacts...

41:38.165 --> 41:43.629
discovered that we had
an unidentified mole in the embassy.

41:43.712 --> 41:46.798
We had the ambassador
in our crosshairs,

41:46.882 --> 41:49.718
until some information
leaked when he was
out of the country.

41:49.801 --> 41:52.804
So that just left
one possibility.

41:52.888 --> 41:54.556
Ah, Ann.
Hello.

41:54.640 --> 41:58.101
Ann...
...Cathcart.
Yeah.

41:58.185 --> 42:01.396
Bishop was involved
in a small but integral
part of the operation...

42:01.480 --> 42:05.567
going East to bring across
an East German functionary
named Schmidt.

42:05.651 --> 42:07.736
Ready?
Yeah.

42:19.998 --> 42:21.667
Ah, fuck!

42:21.750 --> 42:25.170
The passport's in the glove box.
There's some vodka.
Spill it on your coat.

42:25.254 --> 42:28.590
If they stop us,
don't say a word.
Remember, you're drunk.

42:28.674 --> 42:32.970
And where is Mrs. Muir?
Patricia left me
and filed for divorce.

42:33.053 --> 42:36.306
Oh, I'm so sorry, Nathan.

42:36.390 --> 42:38.433
How is it I always
say the wrong things?

42:38.517 --> 42:40.936
Patricia?

42:41.019 --> 42:43.272
Yeah, my third wife.

42:43.355 --> 42:47.109
My God, how many wives
have you had?
Four.

42:47.192 --> 42:50.487
You want to hear
about them, or Bishop?

42:54.032 --> 42:56.410
You see that gentleman?
Yeah?

42:56.493 --> 43:00.164
He's the ambassador.
Why don't you go over there
and say hello to him?

43:00.247 --> 43:02.166
Okay.
Okay?

43:04.626 --> 43:06.545
Your scotch is older
than she is.

43:06.628 --> 43:09.298
Am I supposed to
feel bad about that?

43:15.179 --> 43:18.182
They know.

43:19.266 --> 43:21.185
They have my family
already, I know it.

43:21.268 --> 43:23.187
If they knew, they would
have stopped us.

43:23.270 --> 43:25.314
Tomorrow, your wife, your kids,
will all be safe in Munich.

43:25.397 --> 43:27.483
I gotta make a stop.
What?

43:27.566 --> 43:31.778
It's a scheduled stop.
I gotta make a phone call.
They follow you.

43:31.862 --> 43:33.989
Friedrich, it's all
taken care of, okay?

43:34.072 --> 43:36.033
If they ask, tell 'em
I got sick.

43:44.082 --> 43:48.712
Why don't we go outside?
I'm sure we won't be missed.

43:48.795 --> 43:51.340
I wish I could.

43:51.423 --> 43:53.300
I have to stay
near the phone.

43:53.383 --> 43:55.385
Working on
a Saturday night?

44:05.437 --> 44:08.816
Are you bringing
someone across?

44:23.539 --> 44:26.708
Bitte.

44:35.300 --> 44:39.346
Yes?
Vodka did me in.
I'm comin' home.

44:39.429 --> 44:41.056
Throw out the bottle.
Repeat that?

44:41.139 --> 44:42.891
Throw out the bottle.
They know.

44:42.975 --> 44:45.102
They don't know.
They don't fuckin' know.

44:45.185 --> 44:47.855
They'll be waiting.
Drop as close to checkpoint
as possible.

44:47.938 --> 44:51.358
Negative, we're comin' across.
No. That's an order.

44:57.114 --> 44:59.658
Let him go.
They will kill him.

46:25.035 --> 46:26.995
Change of plans,
Friedrich.

46:32.417 --> 46:34.336
No.

46:34.419 --> 46:37.631
You will drive me across,
just as you said.

46:37.714 --> 46:40.592
If I do that,
they'll kill us both.

46:40.676 --> 46:43.762
This way, we still
have a chance.
You're a liar.

46:43.846 --> 46:49.268
This way, you still
have a chance.
I can't help you.

46:50.561 --> 46:53.230
- Just get out of the car.
- I will not get out.

46:53.313 --> 46:55.816
Get out of the car! Get out!
I will not get out!

46:55.899 --> 46:58.735
I will not!
No! No! No!

46:58.819 --> 47:02.281
No!

47:04.491 --> 47:08.078
Get out.
Get out!

47:08.162 --> 47:11.415
Please.
My wife. My children.

47:11.498 --> 47:13.250
I can't help you!

48:11.558 --> 48:13.435
Nathan, what happened?
What went wrong?

48:13.519 --> 48:15.437
Nothing.
Nothing?

48:15.521 --> 48:18.857
Actually, one thing.

48:18.941 --> 48:20.859
Don't ever question me again.
Ever.

48:20.943 --> 48:22.903
What?
I gave you an order,
you take it.

48:22.986 --> 48:27.032
You don't ask why.
Those ten seconds on the phone
could have blown the op.

48:27.115 --> 48:29.993
The op was bringing
Schmidt across!
The op was
setting up Ann Cathcart.

48:30.077 --> 48:33.664
And your end
had to look legit.

48:33.747 --> 48:35.666
What are you telling me?
Schmidt was bait?

48:35.749 --> 48:39.962
Yes.
Nathan, they executed him
on a shitty cellar floor!

48:40.045 --> 48:42.506
It could have been you.
Let me tell you something
about Schmidt.

48:42.589 --> 48:45.425
He went to the Russians
a week ago, and said he had
a contact, an American.

48:45.509 --> 48:48.470
Somebody he could use.
Don't tell me that.

48:48.554 --> 48:50.681
You didn't look in his eyes.

48:50.764 --> 48:52.224
Don't tell me that!

48:52.307 --> 48:55.310
He was your asset.
Somebody you used
for information.

48:55.394 --> 49:00.107
Aw, Jesus Christ! You don't
just trade these people
like they're baseball cards.

49:00.190 --> 49:01.984
It's not a fuckin' game!
Oh, yes, it is.

49:02.067 --> 49:03.652
That's exactly
what it is.

49:03.735 --> 49:06.613
And it's no kid's game, either.
This is a whole other game.

49:06.697 --> 49:10.075
And it's serious and
it's dangerous-and it's
not one you want to lose.

49:15.831 --> 49:18.000
Nathan,
we killed this man.

49:18.083 --> 49:21.295
We used him,
and we killed him.

49:22.713 --> 49:25.090
Okay, then you gotta help me
understand this one.

49:25.174 --> 49:27.551
You...
Nathan, what are
we doin' here?

49:27.634 --> 49:29.469
Don't give me
some bullshit about
the greater good.

49:29.553 --> 49:32.055
That's exactly
what it's about.

49:34.641 --> 49:37.436
Because what we do
is unfortunately
very, very necessary.

49:37.519 --> 49:40.022
And if you?re not
willing to sacrifice
scum like Schmidt...

49:40.105 --> 49:42.816
for those that want
nothing more than
their freedom,

49:42.900 --> 49:45.652
then you better take
a hard look at your
profession, my friend.

49:45.736 --> 49:47.404
Because it doesn't get any easier.

49:47.488 --> 49:49.865
Why did you use me?
Do you want to walk?

49:49.948 --> 49:51.992
Walk.

49:58.957 --> 50:00.959
You should have told me
about the op.

50:01.043 --> 50:05.422
You used me.
I did. And listen to this,
because this is important.

50:05.506 --> 50:07.925
If you had pulled
some stunt over there,

50:08.008 --> 50:10.093
I wouldn't come after you.

50:10.177 --> 50:13.639
You go off the reservation,
I will not come after you.

50:20.938 --> 50:24.024
Fuck your rules, Nathan.

50:24.107 --> 50:27.361
Okay. But tonight,
they saved your life.

50:55.180 --> 50:58.684
Can we have
the relevant files
on Ann Cathcart?

51:07.067 --> 51:10.904
Ann Cathcart's body
was found...

51:10.988 --> 51:13.657
in the lobby of
a cheap hotel in East Germany,

51:13.740 --> 51:15.784
just two months after
she defected.

51:19.663 --> 51:22.833
Yeah. Beaten to death.

51:22.916 --> 51:26.170
Vopos never solved the case.
And Bishop was in Berlin
when this happened.

51:26.253 --> 51:29.089
We were both in Berlin...
Do you recall
Bishop's reaction...

51:29.173 --> 51:32.092
to the news that
Ann Cathcart was dead?

51:35.387 --> 51:38.515
Motive and opportunity.

51:38.599 --> 51:43.270
Nathan, you should leave here
knowing that we're looking
into every possible scenario.

51:45.272 --> 51:46.982
What's ''Sideshow''?

51:48.901 --> 51:51.069
You don't need to know.

51:54.239 --> 51:56.492
Why are you trying
to burn Bishop?

52:02.289 --> 52:04.249
Troy?

52:12.090 --> 52:15.844
Hold transcription,
hold video.

52:19.264 --> 52:20.891
Sideshow was a bugging op.

52:24.436 --> 52:26.563
Listening to government offices
in eastern China.

52:26.647 --> 52:29.566
The trade talks?
Mm.

52:29.650 --> 52:32.569
And you're afraid
the lid to the cookie jar
is gonna slam shut on our hand?

52:32.653 --> 52:36.657
Oh, come on, guys!
Chinese need trade status
more than we need to give it.

52:36.740 --> 52:38.700
That's not necessarily so.

52:38.784 --> 52:42.162
Twenty-four hours after capture,
Bishop's allowed to start talking.

52:42.246 --> 52:45.833
That gives you, what?
Ten, twelve hours to make a trade.

52:45.916 --> 52:48.001
Come on.
You're on the clock.

52:50.337 --> 52:54.883
He doesn't know anything.
Bishop wasn't on Sideshow.

52:54.967 --> 52:57.427
He wasn't working for us.

52:57.511 --> 53:01.098
He was arrested during
a rescue attempt...

53:01.181 --> 53:04.434
at a prison
outside Su Chou.

53:09.940 --> 53:13.318
Who was he after?
Don't know.

53:15.445 --> 53:17.781
Let go of me!

53:31.545 --> 53:33.463
For more on this
late-breaking story,

53:33.547 --> 53:36.884
we go live to Hong Kong.

53:36.967 --> 53:39.386
It has been confirmed
that the Chinese claim...

53:39.469 --> 53:42.472
to have arrested an American
operative for the C.I.A.

53:42.556 --> 53:46.351
While the State Department
remains quiet, official sources
say that the individual,

53:46.435 --> 53:48.729
working out of American
consulate in Hong Kong,

53:48.812 --> 53:50.898
was captured
in an act of espionage.

53:50.981 --> 53:54.234
If confirmed, this comes
at a bad time for an administration...

53:54.318 --> 53:57.446
which is in the middle
of trade negotiations with China.

53:57.529 --> 54:00.491
The U.S. government is in the process
of negotiating his release.

54:00.574 --> 54:02.451
The embassy promised
to keep us abreast...
We are so fucked.

54:02.534 --> 54:04.995
of the situation a sit develops.

54:05.078 --> 54:09.791
This is Frank Nall, live in Hong Kong.
Guess that limits our options.

54:11.502 --> 54:13.462
I want to know what
you have to say about this,

54:13.545 --> 54:15.923
and I want it
on the record.

54:21.553 --> 54:24.598
When I was a kid,
I used to spend summers
on my uncle's farm.

54:24.681 --> 54:28.852
And he had this plow horse
that he used to work with
every day.

54:28.936 --> 54:31.230
He really loved
that plow horse.

54:31.313 --> 54:32.981
One summer
she came up lame,

54:33.065 --> 54:35.317
and could barely stand.

54:35.400 --> 54:37.945
The vet offered
to put her down.

54:38.028 --> 54:40.489
You know what
my uncle said?

54:42.115 --> 54:44.034
No, Muir.
What did he say?

54:44.117 --> 54:48.080
He said, ''Why would I ask
somebody else to kill a horse
that belonged to me?''

54:56.421 --> 54:58.966
Get me Peter Brody
at the FCC.

54:59.049 --> 55:01.385
I don't care.
Just get him.

55:04.471 --> 55:06.557
Looks like Bishop's
gonna be okay.

55:08.475 --> 55:10.561
Good.

55:12.437 --> 55:15.691
What about the flag?
Keep it.

55:15.774 --> 55:17.693
Something to
remember me by.

55:17.776 --> 55:19.695
You know where to store
this stuff, right?

55:19.778 --> 55:21.905
Yeah.
What do I do with
the storage key?

55:21.989 --> 55:24.575
If I need it, I'll send for it.
I'll send you a postcard.

55:24.658 --> 55:28.036
From where?
Not a chance.

55:28.120 --> 55:31.039
You'd show up and try
to clean the place, and scare
the native girls away.

55:31.123 --> 55:35.586
I wish. I'll be working for
Andy Unger down the hall.

55:43.844 --> 55:46.263
You're gonna miss it.

55:50.017 --> 55:52.561
You know that, don't you?

56:12.956 --> 56:17.920
Thank you. Thank you.
Mm-hmm. Have a nice day.
Thank you. Thank you.

56:27.054 --> 56:30.390
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.
Thank you.

56:30.474 --> 56:33.101
For more on this story,
we go live to Hong Kong.

56:34.770 --> 56:37.648
And, in a late-breaking
development of the incident
reported earlier,

56:37.731 --> 56:41.735
rumours that Tom Bishop,
an alleged C.I.A. operative,

56:41.819 --> 56:45.948
had been captured
in an act of espionage,
now appears to be a hoax.

56:46.031 --> 56:48.492
Tom Bishop died
14 months ago.

56:48.575 --> 56:51.245
While the C.I.A. has
made no official comment,

56:51.328 --> 56:54.289
sources close to the agency
have confirmed Bishop's death
late last year.

56:54.373 --> 56:57.000
The discredited story
has been attributed...

56:57.084 --> 56:59.044
to an overzealous member
of the Chinese government,

56:59.127 --> 57:03.590
who leaked the false information
in the hopes of undermining the
current U.S. trade negotiations.

57:03.674 --> 57:06.760
This is Frank Nall,
live in Hong Kong.

57:06.844 --> 57:08.971
Mr. Muir?

57:21.024 --> 57:23.694
Told you you'd miss it.

57:23.777 --> 57:27.281
Who do you trust
in military intelligence?

57:27.364 --> 57:29.283
I co-signed
Martha Rayburn's car loan.

57:29.366 --> 57:31.493
Listen, Gladys.
I gotta buy some time here.

57:33.412 --> 57:37.332
I'm gonna need imagery Analysis
for a military prison near Su Chou.

57:37.416 --> 57:40.127
And if you use the phones,
don't use these.

57:40.210 --> 57:43.881
Any chance I could
lose my job over this?

57:45.299 --> 57:47.843
Good. I didn't want to work
for Andy Unger anyway.

58:00.439 --> 58:04.485
I know who it is.

58:04.568 --> 58:06.528
I know who Bishop was after.

58:08.906 --> 58:11.533
Well, so do we.
But do you know why?

58:13.327 --> 58:15.996
I mean, if anybody
knew the back story,

58:16.079 --> 58:17.748
I mean, it would,
well, uh,

58:17.831 --> 58:21.543
It?s just that it would make
a congressional hearing
really worth watching.

58:21.627 --> 58:24.671
By the way, that's not
in the op reports.

58:38.101 --> 58:39.937
Muir, you're not cleared
to be in here.

58:40.020 --> 58:43.565
Relax, Kappler.
If I didn't have clearance,
how did I get in?

58:43.649 --> 58:46.026
Where's this report?
I just came from
the seventh floor,

58:46.109 --> 58:48.695
and there's some people
pretty disappointed
it hasn't arrived yet.

58:48.779 --> 58:50.197
Hold on!

58:52.074 --> 58:54.827
What report?

58:54.910 --> 58:56.995
You were at the briefing.
I'm talking about Tom Bishop.

58:57.079 --> 58:59.373
Bishop went rogue.
Yeah, and they were gonna...

58:59.456 --> 59:02.626
pull him out until
somebody up there...
and I'm not gonna say who...

59:02.709 --> 59:05.254
said that your department claimed
there weren't enough resources.

59:05.337 --> 59:07.089
Who said that?

59:08.674 --> 59:11.426
Look, I can buy some time
while you pull this together.

59:11.510 --> 59:14.930
Now, Operation Sideshow.
That's near the prison, right?

59:15.013 --> 59:18.892
Near Su Chou.

59:18.976 --> 59:21.770
China. Come on.

59:24.106 --> 59:27.734
Any air support?

59:39.413 --> 59:41.957
P'eng Hu Islands.

59:42.040 --> 59:43.750
Commander Wiley's
outfit.

59:43.834 --> 59:46.295
Forty minutes from
Su Chou Prison.

59:48.005 --> 59:50.007
Thank you.
Oh, hey,

59:50.090 --> 59:54.219
I'm having a little retirement
dinnerparty tonight.

59:54.303 --> 59:56.722
Services library. Say, 7:00?
Sure.

59:56.805 --> 01:00:00.142
You know, I uh...
I didn't know you liked me.

01:00:18.577 --> 01:00:21.205
What was that all about?
What did Muir want?
What?

01:00:21.288 --> 01:00:23.499
He was just talking.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.794
What about?
His party.

01:00:30.255 --> 01:00:32.174
I don't think
you're invited.

01:00:38.805 --> 01:00:40.682
Gladys?

01:00:40.766 --> 01:00:43.352
Hello?

01:00:43.435 --> 01:00:45.479
It's me.

01:00:47.272 --> 01:00:50.442
Where are you?
First floor coffee shop.

01:00:50.526 --> 01:00:55.823
Talk to me.
Imagery Analysis. They've got
every angle on the prison...

01:00:55.906 --> 01:00:57.825
you could want,
collecting dust.

01:00:57.908 --> 01:00:59.576
Gladys?
Get me whatever they have.

01:00:59.660 --> 01:01:01.495
That'll have to go
through Folger's office.

01:01:01.578 --> 01:01:05.207
I'm aware of that.
I also need info on an outfit
of ours in the P'eng Hu Islands.

01:01:05.290 --> 01:01:09.628
Commander Wiley's outfit.
Muir?

01:01:09.711 --> 01:01:12.506
Muir, wait up.

01:01:14.174 --> 01:01:15.843
And call Kappler
in the map room.

01:01:15.926 --> 01:01:18.887
- Tell him my party's cancelled.
- Your party?

01:01:25.519 --> 01:01:27.938
<i>We're gonna need you
upstairs a bit longer.</i>

01:01:28.021 --> 01:01:32.192
What's that?
I said, we're gonna need you
upstairs a bit longer.

01:01:37.114 --> 01:01:41.076
You got something
in your teeth.

01:01:51.670 --> 01:01:56.175
Harker says you might care
to enlighten us on information
that's not in your op reports?

01:01:56.258 --> 01:01:59.094
I just want
to help out.

01:01:59.178 --> 01:02:01.138
Is it relevant
to the issue at hand?

01:02:04.349 --> 01:02:06.143
