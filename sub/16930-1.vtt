00:37.399 --> 00:42.613
There are, I feel,
only two major frontiers left.

01:01.465 --> 01:04.885
One is the exploration of space...

01:05.052 --> 01:10.057
...which has been carried out in such
a miserable way by Colonel Glenn.

01:10.224 --> 01:15.521
The other is the exploration of
the past. The whole background...

01:15.771 --> 01:20.401
...of geography, climate and animal
life which accompanied man's change...

01:20.651 --> 01:23.946
<i>...from a pre-human to a Homo sapiens.</i>

01:24.196 --> 01:28.867
The earliest evidence of man is the
work of nameless human artists...

01:29.076 --> 01:31.286
...on the walls of caves.

01:31.537 --> 01:35.124
Before this, there is no
recorded history.

01:35.874 --> 01:40.212
One part of our search
has led us to the study of apes.

01:40.421 --> 01:45.759
It was the existence of the gorilla and
the chimpanzee in Central Africa...

01:45.968 --> 01:50.264
...that led us to believe our ancestors
lived on this continent.

01:50.472 --> 01:54.643
These two animals...
The rarest of all the apes...

01:54.893 --> 01:56.937
...is the mountain gorilla.

01:57.813 --> 02:01.942
It inhabits the lush, tropical
highlands of Central Africa...

02:02.192 --> 02:06.864
...so remote that our researcher
suffered an attack of appendicitis...

02:07.072 --> 02:10.449
...and would have died
had it not been for Roz Carr...

02:10.701 --> 02:13.537
...an American friend
living in Rwanda.

02:13.704 --> 02:15.581
They outrank monkeys...

02:17.916 --> 02:21.795
...in intelligence. But the study
of them has virtually ceased.

02:21.962 --> 02:25.924
George Schaller's pioneering study
in 1960 told us that this...

02:26.175 --> 02:31.305
...the largest of all the primates,
is in danger of extinction.

02:31.805 --> 02:36.101
His census showed that there were
fewer than 500 left.

02:36.602 --> 02:41.982
God knows how many we've lost since
then to poachers who invade the forests.

02:42.190 --> 02:44.026
Finally...

02:46.403 --> 02:50.908
...I'm always being asked,
"Why do you do this?"

02:51.742 --> 02:54.995
"Why have you spent your life
looking for something...

02:55.245 --> 02:58.248
...buried in the past for
two million years?"

02:59.541 --> 03:04.254
I suppose the only answer I can give
either you or myself...

03:04.463 --> 03:06.548
...is simply this:

03:07.674 --> 03:10.344
I want to know who I am...

03:10.594 --> 03:15.515
...and what it was that
made me that way. Thank you.

03:34.368 --> 03:38.288
- Dr. Leakey? I'm Dian Fossey.
- My name's Dowd. Howard Dowd.

03:38.538 --> 03:42.834
I'd like you to meet my wife Lucille.
She's a real fan of yours.

03:43.085 --> 03:47.381
We made a contribution to your
Wildlife Fund. We were pleased...

03:47.589 --> 03:51.176
- Excuse me.
- You're doing a hell of a fine job.

03:51.426 --> 03:54.763
Thank you. We need
all the contributions we can get.

03:55.013 --> 03:58.684
- I'm Dian Fossey. I wrote to you?
- Oh, thank you, Miss...

03:58.934 --> 04:02.062
- Fossey.
- We appreciate every contribution...

04:02.312 --> 04:05.565
No, no. I wrote to you
about working for you in Africa.

04:05.774 --> 04:08.860
Forgive me, but I get
many letters from people asking...

04:09.069 --> 04:12.030
I wrote you six times,
about the gorillas.

04:12.280 --> 04:14.116
- Sir!
- The physicalist!

04:14.324 --> 04:16.618
- I'm the physical therapist.
- Hello.

04:16.868 --> 04:19.495
- We're having a con...
- Very good.

04:21.873 --> 04:26.211
I work with handicapped children,
and I spend a lot of time trying...

04:26.461 --> 04:28.088
Excuse me. Do you mind?

04:29.172 --> 04:30.799
- Go ahead.
- Thank you.

04:31.508 --> 04:36.888
Trying to get close to people who
don't like having anyone around them.

04:37.139 --> 04:41.226
I have no formal training,
but I love animals, and I've spent...

04:41.476 --> 04:44.396
...two years in pre-veterinary training.

04:44.646 --> 04:48.316
I know you're sincere, but there are
other considerations.

04:48.567 --> 04:51.695
- Liking animals is not enough.
- You just said...

04:51.945 --> 04:55.407
...you need someone to take
a census of the gorillas.

04:55.615 --> 04:59.995
What about me? I can count!
One, two, three.

05:01.872 --> 05:06.460
You really think you can do it?
Roughing it in Africa for six months?

05:06.668 --> 05:08.128
Yes.

05:09.171 --> 05:11.047
Yes.

05:15.302 --> 05:18.763
I'll tell you what.
Let me think about it.

05:19.764 --> 05:24.811
How long are you gonna think about it?
Until all the gorillas are gone?

05:25.020 --> 05:29.024
Dr. Leakey, you need me.
And I want this job.

05:29.274 --> 05:31.526
Give me this chance.

07:23.430 --> 07:25.348
Dian!

07:26.266 --> 07:27.851
Hi!

07:31.312 --> 07:33.815
- I made it.
- You sure did.

07:34.065 --> 07:35.358
So exciting.

07:35.567 --> 07:39.112
- You have your inoculation certificate?
- Yeah.

07:39.362 --> 07:41.865
- In here somewhere.
- Good trip?

07:42.115 --> 07:46.202
Very interesting.
I'll just give you the whole thing.

07:52.459 --> 07:57.046
There are a lot of soldiers around.
Is something special going on?

07:58.381 --> 08:00.175
Soldiers?

08:00.425 --> 08:05.388
Oh, yes. I suppose it's because they've
been having some sort of civil war.

08:06.723 --> 08:10.435
- A civil war?
- It's nothing to worry about, really.

08:10.685 --> 08:16.441
We have to find porters and a tracker
and stock you up with provisions.

08:17.400 --> 08:18.943
The weather's been dry.

08:19.611 --> 08:24.157
This is the weekly market.
You'll find everything you need here.

08:24.407 --> 08:27.911
First you must find the chaps
who'll be your porters.

08:28.953 --> 08:31.456
Ah, there they are!
There they are!

08:43.092 --> 08:45.428
- Bonbon.
- No bonbon.

08:45.678 --> 08:48.139
No bonbon.

09:00.944 --> 09:01.986
What is it?

09:02.195 --> 09:06.324
Some of them believe a woman
living alone up there has to be mad.

09:06.532 --> 09:07.951
Alone?

09:15.250 --> 09:17.043
- Choose your man.
- What?

09:17.252 --> 09:19.629
Your top man. Your tracker.

09:43.403 --> 09:44.570
Swahili.

09:47.073 --> 09:49.450
Jesus Christ.

09:55.164 --> 09:57.667
Bad hand, good feet.

09:58.251 --> 10:01.379
- You speak English?
- The priest.

10:01.754 --> 10:03.089
St. Christopher.

10:03.339 --> 10:07.427
Patron of saints and travelers,
and me too.

10:07.593 --> 10:08.928
What's your name?

10:09.178 --> 10:12.557
Sembagare. Semba-ga-re.

10:12.890 --> 10:15.518
I am the finest tracker.

10:15.768 --> 10:18.479
This man is not good as me.

10:18.730 --> 10:21.774
Him is a great liar.

10:22.275 --> 10:23.901
Me, I'm the best.

10:25.403 --> 10:29.073
Okay. Okay, Sembagare, you're on.

10:29.365 --> 10:30.950
Thank you.

10:35.121 --> 10:37.623
Can you help me buy groceries?

10:38.875 --> 10:41.502
Food. Food?

10:41.711 --> 10:45.173
- Oh, food. Sure.
- Okay, good.

10:45.423 --> 10:46.924
You coming?

10:47.175 --> 10:50.178
Come on. Maybe you'll get lucky.

10:56.517 --> 10:58.603
- You want this?
- Oh, candles.

10:59.437 --> 11:02.440
We have that.
I've got five of those.

11:06.110 --> 11:08.488
<i>- All right.
- Merci!</i>

11:21.083 --> 11:25.379
Yours. You'll need it to get around
when you're off the mountain.

11:25.588 --> 11:27.840
- Great.
- Now, look here.

11:29.217 --> 11:34.138
We're here. The base at Mount Mikeno
is a four-hour drive.

11:34.847 --> 11:38.142
Leave the jeep here.
It'll be quite safe.

11:38.392 --> 11:42.522
Pick up some local porters.
Climb here, up to here...

11:42.772 --> 11:47.485
...then finish here. Kabara meadow.
George Schaller's cabin's there.

11:47.693 --> 11:50.196
- Really?
- Quite comfortable.

11:51.864 --> 11:53.324
You mean...

11:54.033 --> 11:57.328
...we go now?
- Yes. To make it by sundown.

11:57.578 --> 12:01.666
Dr. Leakey, I just spent 35 hours
on four different airplanes.

12:01.874 --> 12:06.045
- I should at least take a shower.
- No one will mind, dear.

12:06.295 --> 12:08.756
I put something in there for you.

12:09.632 --> 12:12.176
Thank you.
That's very nice of you.

12:13.135 --> 12:15.346
You forgot the rest of my luggage.

12:15.513 --> 12:18.641
No room. They'll be sent up
in a fortnight...

12:18.849 --> 12:22.103
...with the rest of the gear.
- Now, wait a minute!

12:22.353 --> 12:26.315
I quit my job, left my fiancé,
to say nothing of my appendix...

12:26.565 --> 12:30.069
...and flew halfway around
the world. Those cases...

12:30.236 --> 12:34.824
...contain my hair dryer, my makeup,
my underwear and my brassieres.

12:35.074 --> 12:38.995
If they don't go, Dr. Leakey,
I don't go.

12:42.832 --> 12:45.126
- Now for the car.
- Thank you.

12:45.376 --> 12:49.964
As you can see, this is
a Land Rover with four-wheel drive.

12:50.172 --> 12:53.384
It's very simple,
once you get the hang of it.

12:53.592 --> 12:55.970
Red is low to high ratio.

12:56.178 --> 12:59.640
Yellow is two- to four-wheel,
but just use the black.

12:59.849 --> 13:05.688
That's the clutch. Clutch in, first gear.
Clutch out, second gear. Okay?

13:09.442 --> 13:11.944
Good luck, Dian. I have to go.

13:16.198 --> 13:21.120
- You're not coming with us?
- Of course not. My work's in Tanzania.

13:21.370 --> 13:25.750
I'd like weekly reports. You're
expected to contribute material...

13:26.000 --> 13:30.379
<i>...to the National Geographic.
I mustn't miss my plane. Good luck.</i>

13:30.588 --> 13:34.508
If you've any problems,
get in touch with Roz Carr.

13:34.759 --> 13:37.178
- Dr. Leakey!
- Have fun!

14:48.791 --> 14:54.547
- Is it true there's a civil war going on?
- Not where we are going, mademoiselle.

16:25.929 --> 16:28.015
- You must stop.
- I'm fine.

16:28.265 --> 16:29.850
Okay.

16:48.410 --> 16:51.371
Buffalo take four days
to cross the plain.

16:51.622 --> 16:56.335
- They stop and start, stop and start.
- I said, I'm fine.

18:15.372 --> 18:18.500
Mademoiselle, I have hot tea.

18:19.126 --> 18:21.420
Oh, great.

18:31.305 --> 18:34.766
Thank you. It's just what I needed.

18:36.852 --> 18:38.520
Come on in.

18:39.396 --> 18:44.401
Just trying to cram more of George
Schaller's gorilla book into my head.

18:44.651 --> 18:48.322
Come in. Shut the door.
It's freezing.

18:55.078 --> 18:57.497
Is that George Schaller?

18:57.831 --> 18:59.791
George Schaller?

19:00.625 --> 19:03.754
That's David. He's my fiancé.

19:04.004 --> 19:05.547
My future husband.

19:06.757 --> 19:10.427
That's good. Woman, man, children.

19:11.928 --> 19:14.389
Do you have a family, Sembagare?

19:15.474 --> 19:18.143
Once, and no more.

19:20.062 --> 19:24.608
My tribe were killed,
while I was tracking.

19:27.819 --> 19:29.363
I'm so sorry.

19:30.447 --> 19:31.907
Me too.

19:32.407 --> 19:35.243
- Good night.
- Good night.

20:34.761 --> 20:38.849
- How big are these night nests?
- I don't know.

20:40.934 --> 20:44.813
- You mean you've forgotten.
- How can I forget? I never knew.

20:45.772 --> 20:47.858
Night nests, Sembagare.

20:48.108 --> 20:52.654
George Schaller's book says
we count the gorillas' night nests...

20:52.863 --> 20:56.491
...to get the census.
- I don't know about gorillas.

20:56.992 --> 21:00.370
Of course you do. You're a tracker.

21:00.954 --> 21:05.000
Yes, of buffalo, antelope and elephant.

21:06.585 --> 21:08.295
What?

21:08.545 --> 21:11.590
Hey! Hey!

21:12.090 --> 21:15.969
That's great. That's just great.

21:16.595 --> 21:20.807
What the hell have you been doing
for the last five hours?

21:21.057 --> 21:23.685
I've been waiting for you to show me.

21:25.228 --> 21:26.813
Shit.

21:31.818 --> 21:33.153
Shit!

21:39.534 --> 21:44.122
<i>March 23, 1967. Dear Dr. Leakey:</i>

21:44.372 --> 21:47.709
<i>We are doing our very best
to track the gorillas.</i>

21:47.959 --> 21:52.172
<i>We're covering a lot of ground,
but making little progress.</i>

21:52.380 --> 21:57.927
<i>Our only guide is George Schaller's
book. So far we haven't had any luck.</i>

21:58.136 --> 22:03.975
<i>I'm not discouraged, but I'm starting to
think I'll spend six months without...</i>

22:04.184 --> 22:07.729
<i>April 22. Dear Miss Fossey:</i>

22:07.979 --> 22:13.568
<i>Surely you didn't expect them to
come out just so you could count them.</i>

22:13.818 --> 22:17.739
<i>These animals are being
wiped off the face of the earth.</i>

22:17.989 --> 22:22.285
<i>They hold the clue to the way
early man lived in his environment.</i>

22:22.535 --> 22:27.540
<i>- It is essential that we discover...
- I know that! I'm not an imbecile.</i>

22:27.749 --> 22:33.004
<i>I know you're not an imbecile. But it
helps to be reminded of the steps...</i>

22:33.213 --> 22:36.674
<i>... that one always overlooks
in such situations.</i>

22:38.635 --> 22:41.471
Maybe I'm just no damn good at this.

22:41.679 --> 22:43.056
Six weeks.

22:43.306 --> 22:47.936
Six whole weeks and not
a single goddamn gorilla...

22:49.604 --> 22:50.855
Shit.

22:51.481 --> 22:54.234
Shit. I sat in shit.

22:58.029 --> 23:01.908
My God! It's gorilla spoor.

23:02.826 --> 23:06.371
- And it's fresh.
- It most certainly is.

23:40.363 --> 23:41.948
Go on.

24:45.386 --> 24:49.724
Just you wait, Louis Leakey.
Just you wait.

25:37.146 --> 25:39.565
It's so beautiful.

25:51.869 --> 25:54.372
No, mademoiselle. No.

26:29.824 --> 26:32.952
Run! Run, mademoiselle!

27:01.939 --> 27:03.774
Oh, God.

27:04.317 --> 27:07.194
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

27:07.445 --> 27:11.115
What does Schaller's book say
when a gorilla charges?

27:11.991 --> 27:15.494
It says, never run.

27:20.166 --> 27:24.462
God, he was big.
How much do you think he weighed?

27:25.171 --> 27:27.632
Maybe two or three men.

27:27.882 --> 27:32.011
I'm sorry. It was my fault.
I did not do my job.

27:32.261 --> 27:35.932
So fast. I didn't think
he could move that fast.

27:44.148 --> 27:47.068
Mademoiselle. No, mademoiselle. No!

27:50.738 --> 27:52.990
Stop it! Stop it!

27:53.199 --> 27:55.368
What the hell are you doing?

27:55.618 --> 27:59.330
That's mine! Get your hands off!
That's my property.

27:59.580 --> 28:00.956
Stop it!

28:01.207 --> 28:03.876
- Goddamn it!
- Watch out, mademoiselle.

28:04.085 --> 28:06.170
Tell them, Sembagare!
Tell them!

28:12.301 --> 28:14.512
What's he saying?
What's he saying?

28:14.762 --> 28:18.683
Here in Kivu there is problem.
They don't want white people.

28:18.891 --> 28:22.103
It's okay, I have work permit.
A work permit.

28:22.353 --> 28:26.732
I have a work permit. I have permission.
I have a... Permission!

28:26.982 --> 28:29.944
Tell him. Tell him, Sembagare.

28:32.697 --> 28:34.949
No! No! No!

28:36.492 --> 28:37.660
Sembagare!

28:39.787 --> 28:42.123
- I'm not leaving!
- British people out!

28:42.373 --> 28:48.087
- But I'm not British! I'm American!
- White people out! I'll shoot!

29:09.442 --> 29:13.737
Are you in charge here? Who's in
charge here? Are you in charge...?

29:13.988 --> 29:15.865
Screw you!

29:16.115 --> 29:20.202
Get your filthy hands off me,
goddamn it! Get off me!

29:20.619 --> 29:24.582
Find Roz Carr! American woman!
Across the border!

29:30.254 --> 29:33.966
- Sembagare, run! Run!
- I'll meet you at Roz Carr!

29:34.216 --> 29:36.802
I'll be there! Run!

30:30.689 --> 30:32.691
Out! Out!

30:34.068 --> 30:37.780
- Thanks for the lift.
- We don't want any foreign spies.

30:48.207 --> 30:51.752
Don't touch me. My passport.

30:52.461 --> 30:54.046
Okay.

31:07.059 --> 31:08.644
<i>Dr. Leakey:</i>

31:08.894 --> 31:13.649
<i>We have been thrown out of
the Congo. All my research destroyed.</i>

31:13.899 --> 31:18.654
<i>This place is a disaster.
Some little civil war.</i>

31:18.862 --> 31:22.700
<i>For two days now I've been
trying to reach Roz Carr.</i>

31:22.950 --> 31:26.161
<i>I'm afraid I'll never see
Sembagare again.</i>

32:15.919 --> 32:19.256
Mademoiselle, I told you.

32:19.506 --> 32:23.510
I told you, Sembagare's a good tracker.
The best.

32:28.765 --> 32:31.226
I won't ask how you got here.

32:31.727 --> 32:34.146
I'm not sure how I got here. Thanks.

32:41.653 --> 32:43.322
Good God!

32:44.615 --> 32:47.284
What happened to you, child?

32:50.078 --> 32:54.374
Oh, dear, you look exhausted.
Come inside.

32:54.625 --> 32:56.084
What happened?

33:00.088 --> 33:01.882
Come in.

33:05.427 --> 33:10.057
Mrs. Carr. I'm just writing
to my dear patron, Dr. Leakey.

33:10.307 --> 33:13.393
Letting him know that things
have hit a snag.

33:13.644 --> 33:16.897
You're looking better.
Would you like some breakfast?

33:17.105 --> 33:20.859
I'd like to wrap Louis Leakey's cane
around his neck.

33:25.280 --> 33:26.698
Thank you.

33:28.367 --> 33:30.244
My resignation.

33:32.412 --> 33:35.666
- You're leaving?
- What else can I do?

33:38.502 --> 33:44.174
Don't look at me like that. I can't give
you a job when I don't have one myself.

33:45.717 --> 33:47.344
Can I?

33:50.555 --> 33:52.766
Now he can't speak English.

33:57.479 --> 34:03.610
It's not like I'm giving up. I was
kicked out. I didn't have a choice.

34:08.072 --> 34:13.036
I'm gonna go home. I'm gonna buy
the sexiest dress I can find.

34:13.286 --> 34:18.041
I'm gonna marry David. And he'll
never hear another peep out of me.

34:19.126 --> 34:23.338
There's always war and poverty here,
but I love these people...

34:23.505 --> 34:26.049
...and I cannot bear their suffering.

34:26.216 --> 34:30.094
Sometimes it seems so hopeless
that I think I will leave.

34:30.262 --> 34:32.639
I never really decided to stay.

34:32.889 --> 34:37.018
But each time I came up for air
it was spring...

34:37.268 --> 34:39.521
...and I was planting again.

34:39.771 --> 34:44.818
The truth is, I love it here.
This is my home.

34:46.527 --> 34:49.281
You've really made a life
for yourself here.

34:53.284 --> 34:56.663
How far away are those mountains
from Kabara?

34:56.913 --> 35:00.709
Not far, really. But Kabara
is on the Congolese side...

35:00.917 --> 35:03.253
...and the border is closed.

35:03.920 --> 35:06.590
But gorillas don't know borders.

35:06.840 --> 35:09.426
They don't need passports.

35:09.801 --> 35:12.637
Whatever are you talking about?

35:13.555 --> 35:15.348
Dian?

35:16.475 --> 35:18.059
Dian?

35:18.518 --> 35:23.023
Oh, God, that letter!
I've got to stop that awful letter!

35:23.231 --> 35:25.567
Wait! Dian.

35:38.914 --> 35:41.666
<i>Dr. Leakey:
We are starting up again...</i>

35:41.875 --> 35:46.630
<i>... this time from the Rwandan side,
where there is no civil war.</i>

35:46.838 --> 35:52.636
<i>Sembagare has put together a new
team, and we begin at daybreak tomorrow.</i>

35:52.844 --> 35:55.096
<i>This time I have bought a gun...</i>

35:55.305 --> 35:59.851
<i>... and if any civil war comes my way,
it had better watch its ass.</i>

36:00.060 --> 36:03.688
<i>I'll write as soon as we have
established base camp.</i>

36:03.897 --> 36:08.568
<i>P.S., I am sending a few bills
for necessities that were lost...</i>

36:08.777 --> 36:14.032
<i>Miss Fossey, if you expect the National
Geographic to pay for a hair dryer...</i>

36:14.241 --> 36:16.618
<i>... you have another thing coming.</i>

36:16.826 --> 36:19.955
<i>The first item on the agenda
is a new census.</i>

36:20.163 --> 36:23.041
<i>This time,
I suggest you follow Schaller...</i>

36:23.250 --> 36:28.088
<i>... and try counting night nests as
a guide to how many there might be.</i>

36:35.637 --> 36:37.722
Mount Karisimbi.

36:40.767 --> 36:42.936
Mount Visoke.

36:45.063 --> 36:46.564
Karisoke.

36:47.649 --> 36:49.901
Research Center!

37:02.455 --> 37:06.126
<i>We have a new base in
excellent gorilla country.</i>

37:06.334 --> 37:08.461
<i>Dense vegetation, steep slopes.</i>

37:08.670 --> 37:11.589
<i>I've been with gorilla
groups almost daily.</i>

37:11.840 --> 37:15.677
<i>However, the best count
we have been able to make...</i>

37:15.885 --> 37:20.056
<i>... is half of what it was seven
years ago. Not good news.</i>

37:20.265 --> 37:25.103
<i>The number of gorillas that you
report is very low, not surprisingly.</i>

37:25.311 --> 37:28.773
<i>The poachers will have wiped out
the entire species...</i>

37:28.982 --> 37:30.900
<i>... within the next five years.</i>

37:31.109 --> 37:34.487
<i>It's urgent that we get as
much information...</i>

37:34.696 --> 37:39.951
<i>I have been following one gorilla
group which I shall call Group Four.</i>

37:40.160 --> 37:43.621
<i>I've gotten closer
to the females and the young...</i>

37:43.830 --> 37:47.751
<i>... but the silverback remains aloof.
He keeps his distance...</i>

37:47.959 --> 37:50.378
<i>... but watches everything carefully.</i>

37:50.587 --> 37:55.258
<i>I'm moving to within 30 to 60 feet
of them and they're not afraid.</i>

37:55.467 --> 37:59.095
<i>I'm hoping to get close
enough to make real contact.</i>

37:59.304 --> 38:03.475
<i>Dian, George Schaller, who
spent his life studying animals...</i>

38:03.683 --> 38:07.896
<i>... in the wild was wise to keep
his distance. Please be careful.</i>

38:08.104 --> 38:10.857
<i>And can't you smoke
cheaper cigarettes?</i>

38:11.065 --> 38:14.486
<i>Last week, a couple of them
actually approached me.</i>

38:14.694 --> 38:17.739
<i>They were boisterous
and high-spirited.</i>

38:17.947 --> 38:21.826
<i>The silverback watched.
He never takes his eyes off me.</i>

38:22.035 --> 38:25.455
<i>Dian, I urge you for once
to be cautious.</i>

38:26.247 --> 38:30.668
<i>George Schaller never made physical
contact with a gorilla group.</i>

38:30.877 --> 38:33.755
<i>The male silverback can be
very dangerous.</i>

38:33.963 --> 38:37.425
<i>Last week several young gorillas
played around me.</i>

38:37.634 --> 38:39.886
<i>Words can't describe my emotions.</i>

38:40.094 --> 38:43.681
<i>It's made everything we've
been through worthwhile.</i>

38:47.727 --> 38:49.896
<i>I suppose my only regret is that...</i>

38:50.104 --> 38:53.942
<i>... except for Sembagare,
I have no one to share this with.</i>

38:55.360 --> 38:59.822
<i>To be frank, I think they're
quite confused as to my species.</i>

39:00.031 --> 39:03.243
<i>I've gotten them used to me
by mimicking them.</i>

39:03.451 --> 39:06.412
<i>They're fascinated
by my facial grimaces...</i>

39:06.621 --> 39:10.625
<i>... and other actions that I wouldn't
do in front of anyone.</i>

39:10.833 --> 39:15.046
<i>I feel like a fool, but this
technique seems to be working.</i>

39:15.255 --> 39:21.594
<i>And because of the proximity, I've
observed a lot never recorded before.</i>

40:09.684 --> 40:13.730
<i>Miss Fossey, that was undoubtedly
the most foolhardy...</i>

40:13.938 --> 40:18.151
<i>... the most harebrained,
lunatic thing I've ever heard of.</i>

40:18.359 --> 40:23.865
<i>However, since you seem to have been
successful, congratulations.</i>

40:24.073 --> 40:29.162
<i>It is an amazing accomplishment.
And I'm quite proud of you.</i>

40:29.370 --> 40:32.665
<i>The National Geographic
has approved new funding...</i>

40:32.874 --> 40:35.460
<i>... and your work permit
has been extended.</i>

40:35.668 --> 40:38.963
<i>I am pleased that
you're staying on with us.</i>

40:39.172 --> 40:42.341
<i>I am sorry for your young man
in the States...</i>

40:42.550 --> 40:47.972
<i>... but if you showed him what he saved
monthly on candy bars and cigarettes...</i>

40:48.181 --> 40:53.311
<i>... not to mention lipstick and shampoo,
his disappointment would be tempered.</i>

40:53.644 --> 40:56.355
Hey! Don't you dare cook Lucy!

41:24.300 --> 41:26.135
- What?
- No further.

41:26.552 --> 41:28.346
<i>- What is it?
- Sumu.</i>

41:30.556 --> 41:32.183
Black magic.

41:32.517 --> 41:34.310
Black magic?

41:52.203 --> 41:54.038
What is all this?

41:56.374 --> 41:58.000
Batwa cemetery.

42:02.421 --> 42:04.507
No! Put it back!

42:12.807 --> 42:17.603
The stones around the grave, they
keep the soul in the ground at peace.

42:17.812 --> 42:19.897
The circle joins two souls...

42:20.106 --> 42:22.400
...and makes them one forever.

42:32.285 --> 42:36.747
Batwa! We have disturbed
their burial place.

42:46.424 --> 42:47.842
Oh, shit.

42:58.019 --> 43:01.480
They want you to kneel down. Do it!

43:26.297 --> 43:30.092
He wants to touch your hair. Let him.

44:22.228 --> 44:24.105
What was that all about?

44:24.313 --> 44:28.192
Your hair is color of fire.
They think you are a witch.

44:28.526 --> 44:33.239
Oh, yeah?
Well, they wouldn't be the first.

44:36.951 --> 44:38.619
I got it!

44:39.078 --> 44:44.208
I got my work permit renewed.
Four hours of batting my eyelashes.

44:45.709 --> 44:48.045
I need a treat, so I'll be back.

44:59.557 --> 45:03.519
- What?
- Gorilla hand. Gorilla ashtray.

45:05.062 --> 45:08.107
Where did you get this? Mama. Mama.

45:08.649 --> 45:10.985
Please. Sembagare!

45:12.319 --> 45:13.737
Sembagare!

45:17.491 --> 45:20.035
I just want to ask you...

45:22.663 --> 45:25.499
I just want to talk to you.

45:32.923 --> 45:39.138
They say this park is protected, with
these Batwa spring traps everywhere.

45:39.346 --> 45:43.392
Some protection.
No animal is safe around here.

45:46.979 --> 45:48.939
Beautiful.

45:50.566 --> 45:52.568
That's what it's all about.

45:58.407 --> 45:59.867
Oh, no!

46:13.213 --> 46:17.301
Its back is broken from the fall.
It will be dead soon.

46:19.887 --> 46:24.266
- In 30 minutes it will be all over.
- That's too long.

46:46.580 --> 46:48.165
The Batwa did this.

46:48.374 --> 46:50.959
And their fathers, and grandfathers.

46:51.168 --> 46:56.757
And their sons and their grandsons
after them. I don't think so.

47:11.772 --> 47:15.734
<i>If they want a witch,
I'll give them a witch.</i>

48:45.073 --> 48:48.118
Fourth and fifth digits webbed.

48:52.372 --> 48:53.832
Hello, Digit.

50:08.573 --> 50:10.742
This here is her house.

50:12.494 --> 50:15.664
Thanks, okay. Good night.

50:15.872 --> 50:17.374
Good night, sir.

50:23.046 --> 50:25.715
What the hell's going on in there?

50:39.896 --> 50:41.440
What is that?

50:47.195 --> 50:48.655
Hello?

50:51.950 --> 50:53.368
Hello?

50:55.412 --> 50:58.331
That's pretty good. Had me fooled.

51:00.625 --> 51:02.586
Hi, I'm Bob Campbell.

51:02.961 --> 51:07.340
Rotten, lousy weather you have.
Sorry, I'm a day and a half late.

51:07.799 --> 51:10.218
I sent a message from Kigali.

51:11.761 --> 51:13.138
No?

51:13.805 --> 51:15.599
That's Africa for you.

51:16.558 --> 51:18.852
What was the message?

51:20.854 --> 51:23.398
I'm here to photograph your apes.

51:26.359 --> 51:28.653
They're mountain gorillas.

51:31.072 --> 51:33.825
You can't take photographs.

51:35.702 --> 51:40.373
<i>- Who did you say you were?
- Bob Campbell, National Geographic.</i>

51:40.582 --> 51:43.418
Look, I gotta get warm.

51:45.420 --> 51:48.131
This might explain things for you.

51:49.758 --> 51:53.678
It's cold enough in here to hang meat.
Here you go.

51:56.723 --> 52:01.561
<i>I'll save you the eyestrain.
National Geographic want pictures.</i>

52:01.770 --> 52:05.774
It's a matter of not biting
the hand that feeds you.

52:15.617 --> 52:19.788
Do you have any experience with
animals, Mr. Campbell?

52:20.580 --> 52:26.461
In 1950, I was bitten by a
snake in the outback.

52:28.004 --> 52:30.674
There you go. I was 20.

52:31.257 --> 52:35.637
In '58, a Bengal tiger,
Shivpuri, India.

52:36.429 --> 52:39.641
Gee, they don't seem to like you
very much.

52:40.225 --> 52:46.147
No, they don't. In '64, I went through
the ice at Cape Halkett, Alaska.

52:46.356 --> 52:51.361
Had to tread 48-degree water for too
long. I've feared the cold ever since.

52:51.569 --> 52:54.030
You can bunk with Rushemba.

52:54.239 --> 52:56.408
First tent on the right.

53:13.967 --> 53:15.385
Good night.

53:16.386 --> 53:17.887
Good night.

53:31.401 --> 53:36.781
Bloody woman with her monkeys.
Christ! What is this stuff?

53:36.990 --> 53:39.409
Good morning, Mr. Campbell.

53:43.121 --> 53:45.415
Are you having trouble?

53:45.915 --> 53:49.627
Nettles aren't nearly
as dramatic as Bengal tigers.

53:49.836 --> 53:51.421
They bloody hurt.

53:51.838 --> 53:56.092
If you think they hurt now,
just wait a few hours.

53:59.596 --> 54:01.014
Thanks.

54:06.561 --> 54:12.775
You can come with us, but no pictures.
And you stay at least 30 feet back.

54:13.443 --> 54:15.528
So put those away.

54:18.031 --> 54:19.490
Now.

54:22.327 --> 54:23.995
Yes, ma'am.

54:42.555 --> 54:43.973
<i>Merde.</i>

54:45.183 --> 54:47.977
Gorillas get caught in these traps.

54:49.604 --> 54:54.234
Sembagare and I went through
four days ago. We cut 11 traps.

54:54.442 --> 54:58.196
So, imagine a carefree animal.

54:59.781 --> 55:01.991
Goddamn Batwa!

55:02.617 --> 55:05.536
- You can't blame only the Batwa.
- Oh, no?

55:05.745 --> 55:10.249
They've been feeding their families
like this for generations.

55:11.042 --> 55:15.672
If you're going to blame anyone,
you can blame the doctor in Miami.

55:15.922 --> 55:18.675
He hires the bloke
that hires the Batwa.

55:19.217 --> 55:24.222
The Batwa get to feed their kids.
The middleman gets a silk shirt...

55:25.098 --> 55:30.520
...and the doctor gets a gorilla hand
ashtray for his coffee table.

55:30.728 --> 55:35.566
- And a gorilla head for his wall.
- I can't get to the doctor in Miami.

55:35.775 --> 55:40.071
<i>You been to a doctor's office that
didn't have National Geographic?</i>

55:45.034 --> 55:46.494
Have you?

56:05.263 --> 56:07.348
When you photograph...

56:10.810 --> 56:13.354
...no sudden movements.

56:13.563 --> 56:17.817
Stay low. No pointing or waving,
that frightens them.

56:18.025 --> 56:21.821
Not too much eye contact, or
the silverback may charge.

56:22.029 --> 56:26.868
If he does charge, stand your ground.
Never, ever run from a gorilla.

56:36.043 --> 56:37.628
And don't scratch.

56:37.837 --> 56:40.798
You don't have any calamine lotion,
do you?

56:44.177 --> 56:48.014
Better than that. My own brew.

56:54.645 --> 56:59.317
- Is it true you're a witch?
- That's what the Batwa say.

57:13.706 --> 57:16.125
It just looks like guacamole.

57:18.336 --> 57:19.754
Great.

57:20.796 --> 57:23.424
The latest in modern medicine.

57:26.844 --> 57:30.556
Well, good night.

57:31.057 --> 57:32.433
Good night.

57:32.725 --> 57:36.187
Thanks for the lesson
in gorilla etiquette.

57:47.698 --> 57:49.075
What?

57:49.325 --> 57:51.619
It means "brightness and light."

57:52.536 --> 57:54.622
Sembagare, really.

58:13.057 --> 58:18.562
Obviously they know I'm not a gorilla,
but the sound reassures them.

58:19.939 --> 58:21.565
So, what do you want?

58:22.274 --> 58:26.070
The gorillas. You with the gorillas.

58:30.074 --> 58:31.993
I'll go over there.

58:32.785 --> 58:35.746
- Great.
- They don't know you.

58:35.955 --> 58:40.376
They've never seen a tripod,
so move very slowly.

59:11.907 --> 59:14.577
Hello, Tiger. Hello.

01:00:01.316 --> 01:00:02.609
Shit!

01:00:08.740 --> 01:00:12.410
Break off one of those stems
and pretend to eat.

01:00:25.048 --> 01:00:26.966
Act submissive.

01:00:27.717 --> 01:00:31.054
I've never been so submissive
in my life.

01:00:35.934 --> 01:00:37.936
Where is he?

01:00:42.982 --> 01:00:44.692
Losing interest.

01:00:56.121 --> 01:00:58.581
Could you go over to him?

01:01:00.583 --> 01:01:02.127
Digit?

01:01:03.962 --> 01:01:07.215
- Now?
- Is it all right?

01:04:01.806 --> 01:04:05.977
I'm starting to be able to tell the
difference between them.

01:04:06.144 --> 01:04:07.728
Yeah, they...

01:04:09.397 --> 01:04:12.400
As you can see,
they're all different.

01:04:12.608 --> 01:04:15.736
And they all have
very different characters.

01:04:15.945 --> 01:04:20.408
No two have the same nose print,
right?

01:04:22.034 --> 01:04:23.494
Right.

01:04:24.453 --> 01:04:28.291
Effie and Marchessa, there.

01:04:29.333 --> 01:04:31.335
Marchessa has a...

01:04:33.462 --> 01:04:36.299
The bridge of her nose has a curve.

01:04:40.177 --> 01:04:41.721
She has a...

01:04:43.139 --> 01:04:44.640
...curve.

01:04:48.603 --> 01:04:50.146
She has a line.

01:04:51.188 --> 01:04:53.232
A beautiful line.

01:05:03.910 --> 01:05:05.995
A beautiful shape.

01:05:19.050 --> 01:05:20.843
A beautiful curve.

01:05:47.244 --> 01:05:50.247
I was amazed when he came
so close to you.

01:05:50.456 --> 01:05:53.793
Digit and I have a strange connection.

01:05:55.378 --> 01:05:57.838
He has no peers in his group.

01:05:58.589 --> 01:06:00.299
He's alone.

01:06:00.841 --> 01:06:02.968
I understand that.

01:06:08.933 --> 01:06:10.685
Why is that?

01:06:25.116 --> 01:06:28.702
It's nice to see a married man
who can sew.

01:06:39.171 --> 01:06:41.966
How did you know I was married?

01:06:44.635 --> 01:06:50.057
The night you arrived, you shook the
rain off your parka outside the door...

01:06:50.266 --> 01:06:53.394
...so you wouldn't get the floor wet.

01:07:00.943 --> 01:07:02.736
Does it matter?

01:07:17.376 --> 01:07:19.003
Apparently not.

01:09:19.665 --> 01:09:23.292
How'd you go?
Get everything on your list?

01:09:27.965 --> 01:09:33.261
- "Eight more Halloween masks."
- Only red ones. Or ones with red hair.

01:09:33.470 --> 01:09:38.434
I won't even ask why, but I'll try
to get some for you in Nairobi.

01:09:40.685 --> 01:09:42.854
Look what you've got.

01:09:48.152 --> 01:09:49.694
Nice.

01:09:58.912 --> 01:10:02.249
Look what I did. Sorry.

01:10:05.669 --> 01:10:09.423
- What else will you do in Nairobi?
- What do you mean?

01:10:10.924 --> 01:10:13.427
Nothing. Never mind.

01:10:19.808 --> 01:10:22.352
It looks bad for flying.

01:10:26.440 --> 01:10:29.610
- It'll pass.
- I don't think so.

01:10:29.818 --> 01:10:32.571
Those puddle jumpers
can fly in anything.

01:10:32.779 --> 01:10:39.036
I know these storms. You shouldn't be
flying. I'm right about this.

01:10:39.244 --> 01:10:41.205
Yes, you are right.

01:10:43.624 --> 01:10:45.751
I will be seeing my wife.

01:10:47.044 --> 01:10:48.712
I know.

01:10:49.087 --> 01:10:50.631
I know.

01:10:52.507 --> 01:10:54.343
I love you.

01:11:10.609 --> 01:11:12.069
What?

01:11:14.071 --> 01:11:15.739
Oh, no!

01:11:53.777 --> 01:11:55.445
Oh, my God.

01:11:58.156 --> 01:11:59.616
No.

01:12:20.053 --> 01:12:21.847
God. No!

01:12:40.949 --> 01:12:42.325
No!

01:12:47.205 --> 01:12:50.041
Goddamn you. You bastards!

01:12:59.843 --> 01:13:02.637
David, I believe you're a good boy.

01:13:03.805 --> 01:13:07.767
And I have lovely goodies here
for such a good boy.

01:13:13.231 --> 01:13:17.444
Now, you can have it, if you tell me
where they took her.

01:13:32.792 --> 01:13:34.252
Tie him.

01:14:07.994 --> 01:14:10.080
Turn him around!

01:14:17.337 --> 01:14:19.631
Bring him to me!

01:14:22.759 --> 01:14:24.427
You tell me!

01:14:25.387 --> 01:14:26.805
Tell me.

01:14:27.013 --> 01:14:28.473
Tell me, damn it!

01:14:31.142 --> 01:14:33.645
The man who buys the animals...

01:14:37.315 --> 01:14:39.442
- Yes?
- He wanted a baby gorilla.

01:14:39.651 --> 01:14:41.027
Yes?

01:14:42.445 --> 01:14:46.366
- He stays at hotel.
- Where? Where?

01:14:48.201 --> 01:14:49.953
At Ruhengeri.

01:14:52.789 --> 01:14:54.332
Good boy.

01:15:14.602 --> 01:15:16.396
Wait here.

01:15:32.954 --> 01:15:35.457
Rushemba, get the tire iron.

01:15:49.471 --> 01:15:50.889
Come on.

01:16:12.452 --> 01:16:13.953
Shit.

01:16:21.920 --> 01:16:23.630
Come here.

01:16:24.380 --> 01:16:26.174
Come here.

01:16:29.010 --> 01:16:31.095
How could they do this?

01:16:45.860 --> 01:16:48.530
Claude Van Vecten!

01:16:55.328 --> 01:16:59.707
Which one of you is Claude Van Vecten?

01:17:09.759 --> 01:17:13.054
Are you responsible
for kidnapping this animal?

01:17:13.263 --> 01:17:18.017
- How dare you break into my property.
- Lf I see you or your van again...

01:17:18.226 --> 01:17:21.980
...you'll be lucky if you don't end
up in a wooden box!

01:17:22.480 --> 01:17:26.693
Bill of sale, madame.
From the minister of the interior.

01:17:26.943 --> 01:17:31.948
- I'm going to have you arrested.
- You try it. Just try it.

01:17:32.907 --> 01:17:35.076
You piece of shit.

01:17:35.451 --> 01:17:36.869
Bastard!

01:17:53.886 --> 01:17:57.015
Mukara, wait! Wait!

01:17:57.849 --> 01:18:00.435
I'm Dian Fossey. I must talk to you.

01:18:00.643 --> 01:18:04.397
You're the American woman
who lives with the gorillas.

01:18:04.605 --> 01:18:09.902
I don't live with them. I study them.
And today there are six less.

01:18:10.111 --> 01:18:11.946
I don't understand.

01:18:12.155 --> 01:18:13.740
Give her to me.

01:18:14.657 --> 01:18:19.412
- This baby was sold to a zoo broker.
- Yes, I know. I sold it.

01:18:19.620 --> 01:18:20.997
- Just...
- Why?

01:18:21.456 --> 01:18:23.416
Money. Lots of it.

01:18:23.624 --> 01:18:28.296
Five gorillas were killed in the
bargain protecting this baby.

01:18:32.842 --> 01:18:34.260
Here.

01:18:43.019 --> 01:18:45.646
They were murdered by poachers.

01:18:45.813 --> 01:18:49.358
The population now is half
what it was 10 years ago.

01:18:49.525 --> 01:18:54.155
Your problem is decreasing gorillas,
mine is increasing people.

01:18:54.363 --> 01:18:58.284
We're on opposite sides
of the same problem.

01:19:00.578 --> 01:19:02.747
- Can I have this water?
- Sure.

01:19:03.122 --> 01:19:06.375
That kind of money provides
people with food.

01:19:07.084 --> 01:19:10.254
Clothing. Shoes. Medicine.

01:19:11.255 --> 01:19:12.632
Necessities.

01:19:12.840 --> 01:19:16.636
- Do you want to compare priorities?
- No, I don't.

01:19:16.969 --> 01:19:19.889
The Virungas are supposed
to be protected.

01:19:20.097 --> 01:19:22.850
- It's expensive.
- That's your problem.

01:19:23.059 --> 01:19:27.730
Make new laws. Raise taxes.
But give my gorillas protection.

01:19:27.939 --> 01:19:29.690
Your gorillas?

01:19:30.691 --> 01:19:35.655
As I recall, you're a visitor
on a yearly renewable work permit.

01:19:36.072 --> 01:19:41.410
I don't believe that status entitles
you to make government policy.

01:19:48.584 --> 01:19:51.754
What about this poor baby?

01:19:52.213 --> 01:19:55.591
This animal's going to die
in 24 hours.

01:19:55.800 --> 01:20:02.056
You'll return all that money, because
Van Vecten doesn't buy dead property.

01:20:02.932 --> 01:20:08.771
I could try to make her well enough
to make that journey, if...

01:20:11.482 --> 01:20:12.900
If?

01:20:13.109 --> 01:20:19.532
If you give me five men to train
as rangers. Anti-poaching rangers.

01:20:23.035 --> 01:20:26.706
Four men. And you pay
half their salary.

01:20:28.791 --> 01:20:32.628
Three men. And you pay
all their salary.

01:20:37.216 --> 01:20:38.676
Agreed.

01:20:42.680 --> 01:20:46.642
You gotta eat something, you know.
I know you're hungry.

01:20:47.518 --> 01:20:53.566
Just try. Just try a little.
Just a little bit. No?

01:20:55.401 --> 01:20:58.112
It's got lots of vitamins in it.

01:20:58.779 --> 01:21:00.197
Taste it?

01:21:06.078 --> 01:21:11.417
What about this? This is good.
Smell familiar?

01:21:11.834 --> 01:21:14.003
Does it smell like home?

01:21:17.631 --> 01:21:20.551
Pucker, don't do this to me.

01:21:22.470 --> 01:21:24.055
Look at this.

01:21:27.266 --> 01:21:28.684
Very tasty.

01:21:30.478 --> 01:21:33.397
You don't want any, though, do you?

01:21:34.732 --> 01:21:36.567
Do you want some?

01:21:38.152 --> 01:21:43.324
Come on. Thattagirl. Thattagirl.

01:21:44.492 --> 01:21:46.869
That's pretty good.

01:21:49.371 --> 01:21:51.082
Now you can sleep.

01:22:53.269 --> 01:22:55.020
Dian Fossey.

01:22:58.399 --> 01:23:00.734
Pucker, look who's here.

01:23:02.152 --> 01:23:04.280
Pucker, meet Bob.

01:23:09.076 --> 01:23:11.704
- Pucker.
- Hey, it's my turn.

01:23:18.460 --> 01:23:20.004
- Jealous.
- Yeah.

01:23:29.471 --> 01:23:31.140
The tub's for me.

01:23:32.224 --> 01:23:36.061
A daily scalding might just make
this climate bearable.

01:23:41.525 --> 01:23:43.986
You were meant to be a surprise.

01:23:45.362 --> 01:23:47.156
That's a girl.

01:23:48.324 --> 01:23:52.202
- She's adorable.
- And this is for you.

01:23:52.411 --> 01:23:56.040
- You're beautiful. Look at you.
- Do you like her?

01:23:56.248 --> 01:23:58.500
She's so beautiful.

01:23:58.917 --> 01:24:01.420
Break these traps up and burn them.

01:24:02.379 --> 01:24:05.716
- They're new.
- I've hired anti-poaching patrols.

01:24:05.883 --> 01:24:10.220
My woman's the only woman
in the world with her own private army.

01:24:12.473 --> 01:24:15.601
I have so much to tell you.
Pucker was kidnapped...

01:24:15.809 --> 01:24:20.064
I know. So does most of Rwanda,
Nairobi, London and New York.

01:24:20.272 --> 01:24:24.026
You, my beautiful,
are becoming a legend.

01:24:26.653 --> 01:24:29.114
Would you like to go to the movies?

01:24:29.323 --> 01:24:33.660
- Can I have a bath first?
- You can have a bath second.

01:24:47.633 --> 01:24:50.302
Why am I in this movie so much?

01:24:53.764 --> 01:24:57.810
You're the story.
You're what people are interested in.

01:24:58.018 --> 01:24:59.561
The gorilla girl.

01:25:00.187 --> 01:25:03.065
It makes me look like
some real weirdo.

01:25:03.273 --> 01:25:06.110
Crawling around the mud
in this climate...

01:25:06.318 --> 01:25:10.197
...after a bunch of gorillas might
be perceived as weird.

01:25:10.489 --> 01:25:14.827
- Do you think I'm weird?
- I do. Absolutely. Without question.

01:25:18.330 --> 01:25:22.543
I also think you are wonderful.

01:25:26.630 --> 01:25:29.842
Which comes first, weird or wonderful?

01:25:30.050 --> 01:25:31.885
Weird.

01:25:38.600 --> 01:25:41.311
The gorillas look great.

01:25:47.609 --> 01:25:49.403
Look at that.

01:25:49.736 --> 01:25:51.947
You see anyone you know?

01:25:56.159 --> 01:25:59.329
I've asked my wife for a divorce.

01:26:03.375 --> 01:26:05.502
Did you hear me?

01:26:14.761 --> 01:26:17.639
- I'm scared.
- You're scared?

01:26:17.973 --> 01:26:22.978
I'm about to marry a girl who's liable
to have gorillas for bridesmaids.

01:26:23.186 --> 01:26:25.355
You should be scared.

01:26:27.107 --> 01:26:28.984
Do you know what I want?

01:26:30.360 --> 01:26:35.073
I want to get this film finished
and be well paid for it.

01:26:35.282 --> 01:26:38.201
Go to a warm climate...

01:26:38.410 --> 01:26:43.415
...and be around to make love to you
on your 64th birthday.

01:26:49.296 --> 01:26:55.469
Are you looking after Pucker for me?
Good dog, yeah. You're a good dog.

01:27:09.107 --> 01:27:10.484
What?

01:27:15.614 --> 01:27:19.409
He's got the shape of the face.
But he missed on the nose.

01:27:19.618 --> 01:27:23.372
That's not funny.
Where did they get your hair?

01:27:25.207 --> 01:27:27.626
I haven't seen my hairbrush.

01:27:27.834 --> 01:27:30.879
- I thought Semby...
- These Batwa are upset.

01:27:31.380 --> 01:27:34.508
Well, I'm not running for
Miss Congeniality.

01:27:46.561 --> 01:27:49.856
That's a good girl. Yes. Yeah.

01:27:52.317 --> 01:27:53.735
Leave her.

01:27:59.491 --> 01:28:04.037
We've got to go now.
Van Vecten's men are ready to leave.

01:28:10.418 --> 01:28:13.004
Come on. Come on.

01:28:13.797 --> 01:28:18.051
Yes. Look at this yummy drink.
Come on, let's go.

01:28:19.094 --> 01:28:24.474
Up you go. Yes, that's a good girl.
What a good girl you are. Yes.

01:28:24.850 --> 01:28:26.601
Yes, that's it.

01:28:28.979 --> 01:28:31.565
Here's some nice cabbage.

01:28:32.440 --> 01:28:36.069
- Okay, Pucker, in we go.
- I put some cabbage in there.

01:28:37.154 --> 01:28:38.905
There. It's all right.

01:28:39.114 --> 01:28:42.284
- And lots of water.
- Quickly, put that on.

01:28:42.742 --> 01:28:46.079
- It's gonna be fine. Really.
- I'll do that.

01:28:46.955 --> 01:28:49.875
Be brave. Be brave.

01:28:55.881 --> 01:29:00.719
- Off you go. Go on.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:29:01.553 --> 01:29:04.180
- Pucker.
- It's all right.

01:29:07.142 --> 01:29:08.602
God!

01:29:43.386 --> 01:29:47.933
You know, if you could mix up
a shrinking potion, Witch Fossey...

01:29:48.391 --> 01:29:53.271
...we could sit on this twig, float
down this stream into the Nile...

01:29:53.855 --> 01:29:57.025
...go through the Sudan, past Cairo...

01:29:57.233 --> 01:30:00.737
...pop out into the Mediterranean
near Alexandria...

01:30:00.945 --> 01:30:05.617
...where I'd buy a bottle of retsina
and I would toast your beauty.

01:30:16.670 --> 01:30:19.923
Dian, we can't stay
on this mountain forever.

01:30:21.257 --> 01:30:22.634
Sure we can.

01:30:23.218 --> 01:30:27.597
The pictures are selling very well.
Job offers are coming in.

01:30:27.931 --> 01:30:30.100
But the gorillas are here.

01:30:33.311 --> 01:30:34.896
I'm here.

01:30:37.440 --> 01:30:42.445
We'll get a good researcher to look
after the center part of the year.

01:30:42.821 --> 01:30:48.159
I don't want snotty little scientists
with slide rules in their pockets...

01:30:48.368 --> 01:30:50.120
...peering at my gorillas.

01:30:50.328 --> 01:30:53.748
- Hold on. I'm talking about six months.
- I don't.

01:30:53.957 --> 01:30:59.212
Six months here.
Six months out of here. That's all.

01:31:00.672 --> 01:31:05.218
You know, I just can't imagine not
being out with them every day.

01:31:07.053 --> 01:31:09.097
Seeing their faces...

01:31:10.014 --> 01:31:12.851
...hearing them. Smelling them.

01:31:13.643 --> 01:31:17.439
Every time I think I know everything
about a gorilla...

01:31:17.605 --> 01:31:20.316
...something completely new happens.

01:31:23.361 --> 01:31:24.946
I'm hooked.

01:31:26.698 --> 01:31:28.783
How can I give that up?

01:31:31.911 --> 01:31:33.413
Yeah.

01:31:54.976 --> 01:31:57.687
<i>This is from the Geographic.</i>

01:31:58.605 --> 01:32:01.232
I've been offered a job in Borneo.

01:32:03.568 --> 01:32:05.612
They want you to come too.

01:32:09.490 --> 01:32:11.826
It's studying primates.

01:32:12.911 --> 01:32:14.287
Your field.

01:32:34.849 --> 01:32:37.060
Is the projector well-packed?

01:32:37.268 --> 01:32:38.645
Good.

01:32:39.938 --> 01:32:42.607
That's both the tripods there, is it?

01:32:46.277 --> 01:32:49.197
Look, I've gotta go, all right?

01:32:50.740 --> 01:32:52.700
It's a job.

01:32:54.160 --> 01:32:57.789
I can't go the rest of my life
without working.

01:33:05.588 --> 01:33:06.965
I'm sorry.

01:33:08.633 --> 01:33:10.426
I'm not like you.

01:33:10.593 --> 01:33:14.972
I can't spend the rest of my life
up here. I wish I could.

01:33:16.140 --> 01:33:17.558
I'm sorry.

01:33:21.813 --> 01:33:24.023
I'll write to you soon.

01:33:24.982 --> 01:33:30.321
But in the meantime, will you get a
two-way radio so I can talk to you?

01:33:48.256 --> 01:33:50.133
If you go...

01:33:51.843 --> 01:33:53.511
...don't write.

01:33:58.141 --> 01:34:01.310
Please don't come back.

01:35:00.953 --> 01:35:02.580
Let's go.

01:35:47.458 --> 01:35:51.003
You're our very first research
students, actually.

01:35:51.212 --> 01:35:54.799
Let me take one of those.
It's a long road. Here.

01:35:55.466 --> 01:35:57.802
What's in here? Rocks?

01:36:14.944 --> 01:36:16.362
Mukara?

01:36:16.988 --> 01:36:19.073
What did Van Vecten want?

01:36:19.281 --> 01:36:22.994
It seems the Cologne Zoo
wants another gorilla.

01:36:24.495 --> 01:36:28.416
But don't worry,
I told him that's all over.

01:36:29.834 --> 01:36:31.919
One gorilla wasn't enough?

01:36:32.128 --> 01:36:34.839
Pucker died a year after delivery.

01:36:39.635 --> 01:36:41.595
Good for Pucker.

01:36:47.852 --> 01:36:52.857
Well, when Leakey died,
I almost chucked it all and went home.

01:36:53.065 --> 01:36:55.359
But I thought of my gorillas.

01:36:55.568 --> 01:37:00.281
I haven't lost one to poachers in over
10 months. That's a record.

01:37:00.489 --> 01:37:04.034
<i>- What does Toto ya Nyoka mean?
- Who called you that?</i>

01:37:04.577 --> 01:37:05.953
Awaka.

01:37:07.872 --> 01:37:12.042
It means, affectionately,
"the worm boy."

01:37:13.627 --> 01:37:14.962
Great.

01:37:19.425 --> 01:37:21.135
Look around you.

01:37:21.927 --> 01:37:25.139
This is as close to God as you get.

01:37:29.768 --> 01:37:31.228
Let's go.

01:37:43.032 --> 01:37:44.241
Get down.

01:37:45.993 --> 01:37:48.412
I don't know this one.

01:37:51.415 --> 01:37:53.125
No! Don't move!

01:39:04.822 --> 01:39:06.907
It's just a bluff.

01:39:42.651 --> 01:39:47.322
Kim? Good morning. Lovely weather.
Better put your hood on.

01:39:47.531 --> 01:39:50.242
You'll go with Sembagare and me today.

01:39:50.451 --> 01:39:52.202
Good morning, Brendan.

01:39:52.953 --> 01:39:55.330
Larry, you're late again!

01:39:56.540 --> 01:40:00.627
It is not my job to get you up
in the morning. Be on time.

01:40:00.836 --> 01:40:06.091
Brendan and Larry, go with the rangers.
Dominique, show them how to cut traps.

01:40:06.300 --> 01:40:08.886
You all need to improve with a panga.

01:40:09.094 --> 01:40:10.971
- Use it.
- May I have a word?

01:40:11.180 --> 01:40:12.598
What is it?

01:40:12.806 --> 01:40:15.225
I know it's important to cut traps.

01:40:15.434 --> 01:40:20.397
But I am so close to getting my
data for the birth-frequency graph.

01:40:20.606 --> 01:40:26.153
You know the rule. No research unless
you put in the time to protect them.

01:40:26.361 --> 01:40:29.364
Now, no more of that "me"-itis.
Let's go.

01:40:43.629 --> 01:40:46.507
- Simba's much bigger.
- Yeah.

01:40:48.634 --> 01:40:51.512
She's due in about two weeks now.

01:40:58.602 --> 01:41:01.813
Check out the proud father over there.
Digit.

01:41:06.902 --> 01:41:09.196
It's the infant, Kweli.

01:41:11.031 --> 01:41:14.493
That's right.
You've been doing your homework.

01:41:16.161 --> 01:41:21.375
In your book, you mentioned a great
lobelia zone near here. Could I see it?

01:41:21.583 --> 01:41:24.378
- Giant lobelia.
- Giant lobelia.

01:41:24.586 --> 01:41:27.798
Could I see it? Today, with you?

01:41:29.299 --> 01:41:30.759
Sure.

01:43:09.566 --> 01:43:11.651
Digit's group.

01:44:17.133 --> 01:44:18.635
Go on!

01:45:05.849 --> 01:45:07.517
Digit.

01:45:18.153 --> 01:45:20.363
No, mademoiselle.

01:46:09.871 --> 01:46:14.918
- What about the rest of the group?
- They got away.

01:47:26.531 --> 01:47:31.619
Tell him he no longer has
his courage or his manhood.

01:47:51.639 --> 01:47:55.768
Ruhengeri. Police.

01:48:15.371 --> 01:48:18.875
How could you do that?
I don't care what he did.

01:48:19.042 --> 01:48:21.294
This isn't your private kingdom.

01:48:21.502 --> 01:48:24.005
That was sick.

01:48:28.718 --> 01:48:31.220
You think I'm sick?

01:48:33.264 --> 01:48:35.350
Am I a murderer?

01:48:35.516 --> 01:48:41.814
Did I do this? This won't stop
until those butchers are stopped!

01:48:50.073 --> 01:48:55.703
What are you crying about? If I hadn't
been wasting my time with you...

01:49:45.253 --> 01:49:48.381
- I found these.
- Leave them.

01:49:59.851 --> 01:50:03.271
Mademoiselle. Mademoiselle!
That's too much!

01:50:03.437 --> 01:50:05.565
- You get out of this!
- No, no!

01:50:05.731 --> 01:50:07.733
Stop it!

01:50:08.693 --> 01:50:11.904
- I mean it! You stay out of this!
- No, madame!

01:50:12.071 --> 01:50:16.325
- Stop it! Stay out of this! I mean it!
- No!

01:50:56.866 --> 01:51:01.162
Kim? I'd like to talk to you, please.

01:51:01.370 --> 01:51:03.497
May I come in?

01:51:12.089 --> 01:51:14.300
God.

01:51:18.346 --> 01:51:20.181
This is not a summer camp.

01:51:20.348 --> 01:51:25.353
If you wanna crawl in and out of each
other's beds, do it somewhere else.

01:51:25.519 --> 01:51:26.687
You're fired!

01:51:26.854 --> 01:51:30.274
You can't fire us!
We don't work for you!

01:51:30.483 --> 01:51:33.527
Get off my mountain!

01:51:33.861 --> 01:51:35.905
What are you staring at?

01:51:36.072 --> 01:51:38.741
What are you gawking at,
you lazy wogs?

01:51:38.908 --> 01:51:41.744
If you'd done your job,
this wouldn't have happened!

01:51:41.911 --> 01:51:46.415
- Don't speak to them that way.
- I pay them! I can talk how I want!

01:51:46.582 --> 01:51:49.085
- You don't pay much.
- I pay plenty!

01:51:49.251 --> 01:51:52.588
Sembagare, whose side are you on?

01:51:53.047 --> 01:51:55.466
I'm on your side.

01:51:56.217 --> 01:51:59.804
I'm always on your side, mademoiselle.

01:52:00.471 --> 01:52:03.474
But you have made me ashamed of you.

01:52:12.024 --> 01:52:13.901
They took his head.

01:52:14.568 --> 01:52:17.696
And his hands.

01:52:18.864 --> 01:52:22.326
They took his head.

01:53:56.962 --> 01:54:00.049
I heard Digit's group last night.

01:54:01.342 --> 01:54:03.969
Near the west ravine.

01:54:33.624 --> 01:54:36.710
Get on with it, Sembagare.

01:55:04.405 --> 01:55:07.866
Hi, Maggie. I'm back.

01:55:08.033 --> 01:55:10.452
Hello. How are you?

01:55:14.248 --> 01:55:15.999
Yes.

01:55:20.796 --> 01:55:22.464
Yes.

01:55:42.276 --> 01:55:44.945
I don't see Simba.

01:55:50.117 --> 01:55:52.661
Simba's not here.

01:56:01.211 --> 01:56:03.881
Oh, no.

01:56:15.642 --> 01:56:19.354
- No?
- No. Nothing.

01:56:33.327 --> 01:56:35.495
Simba.

01:56:52.554 --> 01:56:54.222
Hi.

01:57:00.812 --> 01:57:04.483
Hello. Hello.

01:57:09.321 --> 01:57:14.368
Fourth and fifth digits webbed.
I know you.

01:57:56.535 --> 01:58:00.914
Nice ring, Van Vecten.
Zoo sale profits?

01:58:01.498 --> 01:58:05.585
Miss Fossey, where did you see
your first wild animal?

01:58:05.752 --> 01:58:08.588
In a zoo, wasn't it?

01:58:09.297 --> 01:58:12.968
You like this ring? You wanna
keep the hand it's on?

01:58:13.135 --> 01:58:17.347
If I see or hear or smell you
anywhere near my gorillas...

01:58:17.514 --> 01:58:22.018
...you'll be writing with your other
hand, and I'll have an ashtray.

01:58:22.185 --> 01:58:25.480
- You understand me?
- You are mad. Crazy woman.

01:58:25.689 --> 01:58:28.024
- I am crazy.
- You go too far.

01:58:28.191 --> 01:58:29.735
- Good!
- Don't push me!

01:58:29.901 --> 01:58:34.239
I'll push you off the face
of the earth! You murderer!

01:58:42.164 --> 01:58:46.460
Mukara was here this afternoon.
He is very angry with you.

01:58:46.626 --> 01:58:51.214
He says you are telling people
there's typhoid on the mountain.

01:58:55.093 --> 01:58:58.513
The government needs money
from the tourists.

01:58:58.722 --> 01:59:03.185
They get very mad if you
scare these people away.

01:59:14.154 --> 01:59:18.408
Mukara also said last week
you shot a tourist in the meadow.

01:59:18.575 --> 01:59:21.244
Now, that is not true.

01:59:21.411 --> 01:59:24.456
I shot way over their heads.

01:59:25.207 --> 01:59:29.085
They are not going to turn
this mountain...

01:59:29.336 --> 01:59:32.839
...into a goddamn zoo.

01:59:35.175 --> 01:59:37.677
They're not.

01:59:37.844 --> 01:59:42.599
Mademoiselle, Mukara told me to
tell you if you continue to do this...

01:59:42.807 --> 01:59:47.479
...they won't give you a new work permit.
- Did he, now?

02:00:02.869 --> 02:00:08.416
A three-year work permit.
Issued 10 days ago.

02:00:10.085 --> 02:00:13.254
They can't touch me now.

02:00:53.128 --> 02:00:55.422
That's a beauty.

02:01:26.870 --> 02:01:29.414
You're beautiful.
