00:06.320 --> 00:08.320
I'd like to officially
welcome you to Storybrooke.

00:08.422 --> 00:09.855
A twin brother?

00:09.957 --> 00:11.189
And you gave him to that man?

00:11.291 --> 00:12.824
This was my father's coin.

00:12.926 --> 00:15.327
I need to know if his death
was really an accident.

00:15.429 --> 00:17.129
My father, he had been stabbed.

00:17.231 --> 00:18.463
And he wasn't drunk.

00:18.565 --> 00:21.033
That means his killer
could still be out there.

What happened?

00:43.590 --> 00:47.893
I couldn't get any
money for the medicine.

00:47.995 --> 00:49.895
I'm sorry, Ruth.

00:49.997 --> 00:52.264
I've failed my sons.

Such strong names,

01:00.774 --> 01:02.007
but yet...

01:02.710 --> 01:04.141
such weak lungs.

01:04.244 --> 01:06.244
And good medicine is
so expensive nowadays.

01:06.346 --> 01:10.348
Perhaps... I can help.

We have nothing to give you for that.

Do your boys like bedtime stories?

01:16.090 --> 01:17.456
All right, here's one.

01:17.558 --> 01:20.525
Once upon a time, there
was a king named George.

01:20.627 --> 01:22.828
He had great riches, but no son.

01:22.963 --> 01:24.830
And then there was a
farmer named Robert...

01:24.932 --> 01:29.668
poor as dirt... yet he had two sons.

01:29.770 --> 01:32.304
Can you guess how this story ends?

01:32.406 --> 01:33.739
Get out!

01:33.841 --> 01:36.308
Our sons are not for sale.

01:36.410 --> 01:39.027
Then, they won't survive
the winter, dearie.

have one healthy son...

or two dead ones.

01:52.192 --> 01:54.760

01:54.862 --> 01:56.094
We have to do this, Ruth.

01:56.196 --> 01:58.029
[Babies cooing]

01:58.132 --> 01:59.498
Wise choice.

01:59.600 --> 02:03.602
All we have to do now is decide
which son goes to the king.

02:03.608 --> 02:05.675
An impossible decision, I know,

02:05.873 --> 02:08.940
so let's make it simple.

02:09.042 --> 02:11.643

How could you bring him here?

05:43.227 --> 05:44.626
You weren't there.

05:44.825 --> 05:47.659
He was miserable in his world, and...

05:47.728 --> 05:50.942
he wanted a fresh start, and
I'm just trying to help him.

05:59.239 --> 06:01.006
We've barely even talked.

06:01.074 --> 06:03.408
Well, there's some things
you should probably tell him.

06:03.477 --> 06:05.643
Like, for example... he has a daughter.

06:05.746 --> 06:06.778
It's not <i> his</i> daughter.

06:06.784 --> 06:10.010
Exactly my point...
they're different people.

06:11.251 --> 06:13.418
But there could be a
part of him in there.

06:13.520 --> 06:15.653
He was able to cross
into the real world.

06:15.722 --> 06:18.790
That... that has to mean something.

06:18.859 --> 06:21.292

It's about David, actually.

06:36.243 --> 06:37.509
Hmm.

06:37.532 --> 06:41.200

06:41.381 --> 06:42.914
what I used to be.

06:43.016 --> 06:44.249
A pirate.

06:44.317 --> 06:46.217

I am still a pirate,

06:46.223 --> 06:49.858

And yet, sometimes...

Mm.

out <i>how</i> to ask him

I don't think David does.

07:44.111 --> 07:46.744
that's standing between you and Emma...

I mean, life is too precious.

something happened.

12:11.286 --> 12:13.220
I saw my father's ghost.

12:13.288 --> 12:14.788
You entirely sure about that?

12:14.890 --> 12:15.956
Yes, I'm sure.

12:16.024 --> 12:17.257
And don't tell me I need more sleep.

12:17.263 --> 12:18.959
I've had plenty, and I
still saw him right there,

12:19.061 --> 12:20.460
staring at me.

12:20.562 --> 12:23.196
I'd given up on him, Hook.
What kind of son does that?

12:23.265 --> 12:24.931
A son with a family of his own.

12:24.967 --> 12:27.334
I can't abandon one family for another.

12:27.436 --> 12:31.304
My father was a weak man, but
he's still <i> my</i> father...

12:31.373 --> 12:32.706
and he deserves justice.

12:32.712 --> 12:34.145
Now...

12:34.659 --> 12:36.070
will you help me?

12:36.412 --> 12:38.645
Perhaps Emma would be
better-suited to help.

12:38.714 --> 12:40.981
She's sheriff, after all, and Savior,

12:41.083 --> 12:43.049
and she has... you know, magic.

12:43.118 --> 12:44.301
No, no, don't call Emma.

12:44.307 --> 12:46.607
I don't want to worry her or Snow.

12:47.156 --> 12:49.691
What I might have to do,
they wouldn't approve of.

12:53.328 --> 12:54.494
But you think I would?

12:54.596 --> 12:56.797
You're a pirate, and
a pirate's what I need.

12:56.803 --> 12:58.903
Come on... You gave me an idea.

13:00.135 --> 13:02.335
[Door opens]

13:04.554 --> 13:08.375
So, everybody in this book
lives here, in Storybrooke?

13:08.477 --> 13:09.743
Most of them.

13:09.845 --> 13:11.878
I-I don't see any
tales of you and Robin.

13:11.980 --> 13:15.182
That must be... quite the story.

13:15.284 --> 13:17.918
It is.

13:17.986 --> 13:20.987
Perhaps you'd care to
share it with me sometime.

13:24.860 --> 13:27.060
[Doorbell rings]

13:27.129 --> 13:29.996
Sorry. Um...

13:30.065 --> 13:31.031
Don't go anywhere.

13:31.133 --> 13:32.803
I'll be right back.

13:37.906 --> 13:39.506
So, when were you
planning on telling me?

13:39.608 --> 13:40.774
Where the bloody hell is he?!

13:40.780 --> 13:42.213
Zelena!

13:42.411 --> 13:43.877
You can't see him yet.

13:43.946 --> 13:46.480
Why? Because he's scheming
to take back baby Robin?

13:46.582 --> 13:47.447
That's not gonna happen.

13:47.549 --> 13:49.512
Trust me. That's not the problem.

13:49.973 --> 13:52.018
You haven't told him he's
got a child, have you?

13:52.024 --> 13:53.787
Well, I am going to tell him.

13:53.889 --> 13:56.122
It's... difficult.

13:56.128 --> 13:58.728
Actually, it's quite easy.

13:58.927 --> 14:01.695
You tell him that he has
<i>no</i> rights to his daughter...

14:01.797 --> 14:02.963
none.

14:03.031 --> 14:04.264
And if he comes anywhere near her,

14:04.270 --> 14:05.599
I will make him bleed!

14:05.667 --> 14:07.400
Go home, Zelena.

14:07.503 --> 14:08.401
[Chuckles]

14:08.504 --> 14:09.903
Ta-ta.

14:13.537 --> 14:15.976
Robin, there's something I need to...

14:17.513 --> 14:19.279
Robin?

14:26.112 --> 14:27.773
Nottingham?

14:28.624 --> 14:30.246
Oh, no.

14:50.074 --> 14:51.440
[Gasps]

14:51.509 --> 14:53.075
Well, fancy that.

14:53.144 --> 14:54.176
The Sheriff of Nottingham.

14:54.245 --> 14:55.744
Oh. Now wait. Look,
I heard you were back.

14:55.846 --> 14:56.745
Look, I'm not that man here.

14:56.814 --> 14:58.013
Nobody calls me that in Storybrooke.

14:58.082 --> 14:59.315
I'm not from Storybrooke.

15:00.851 --> 15:02.685
You know, I could've
killed you with that arrow.

15:02.753 --> 15:03.919
But after all you did to me,

15:03.988 --> 15:05.321
I wanted this to be more personal.

15:05.423 --> 15:06.555
Stop!

15:06.657 --> 15:07.856
Regina, leave, now!

15:07.959 --> 15:09.258
Don't do this. This isn't you.

15:09.327 --> 15:10.426
No, you mean, this isn't him.

15:10.494 --> 15:12.027
This isn't <i> your</i> Robin, but me?

15:12.096 --> 15:13.829
I've wanted to do this for years.

15:15.666 --> 15:16.966
What the hell did you do?

15:17.354 --> 15:18.954
I sent him somewhere else

15:18.960 --> 15:20.865
before you did something you'd regret.

15:20.871 --> 15:21.870
Who says I'd regret it?

15:21.939 --> 15:24.606
Well, trust me... someday, you would.

15:25.217 --> 15:27.772
[Scoffs]

15:27.778 --> 15:29.378
Here, let me see your hand.

15:31.582 --> 15:32.982
[Sighs]

15:33.084 --> 15:36.251
I know someplace where
we can fix this up, but...

15:36.354 --> 15:38.420
but I need you to promise

15:38.489 --> 15:42.758
that you'll stop running away
and trying to kill people.

15:45.596 --> 15:46.729
All right.

15:47.263 --> 15:48.611
Lead the way.

15:51.669 --> 15:52.935
You're sure Emma's gone?

15:53.004 --> 15:54.803
Well, she's taken Henry
on a canoeing trip.

15:54.872 --> 15:56.438
She's gone all day. Why are we here?

15:56.507 --> 15:58.874
Like you said... Emma
has magic, we don't.

15:58.976 --> 16:00.275
Hang on. What is this?

16:00.344 --> 16:01.877
Emma's trying to break the curse, right?

16:01.946 --> 16:03.645
Regina just gave her
a whole box of potions.

16:03.714 --> 16:05.914
Yes, smells quite
pungently of newt in there.

16:05.983 --> 16:08.217
So we borrow a few
ingredients and a spell book,

16:08.285 --> 16:09.618
and we learn what happened to my father.

16:09.720 --> 16:11.720
Wait. Stop.

16:11.822 --> 16:12.921
You trying to cast a spell?

16:12.990 --> 16:14.456
Look, if you're too
afraid, forget about it.

16:14.525 --> 16:15.524
I'll do it myself.

16:15.626 --> 16:17.259
I'm not afraid. I'm concerned.

16:17.361 --> 16:18.594
You really have no qualms

16:18.696 --> 16:19.962
about stealing from your own daughter?

16:20.064 --> 16:21.196
What is with you today?

16:21.265 --> 16:22.831
You spend your whole
life a thieving pirate,

16:22.933 --> 16:24.366
and the one time I
need you to be that guy,

16:24.468 --> 16:25.868
you get cold feet.

16:25.936 --> 16:28.637
Perhaps I'm trying not
to be that guy anymore.

16:28.706 --> 16:29.638
Come on, buddy.

16:29.740 --> 16:30.806
It's just me here.

16:30.908 --> 16:33.609
Now, I need a key to the shed

16:33.677 --> 16:35.144
and a lookout.

16:38.649 --> 16:40.382
There. That wasn't so hard.

16:40.484 --> 16:41.784
Now you keep watch.

16:51.095 --> 16:54.463
Six years ago, you took my son.

16:54.565 --> 16:56.198
And now I need your help.

16:56.300 --> 16:57.666
Well, I'm sorry... a deal's a deal.

16:57.735 --> 16:59.268
Can't give you back the boy.

16:59.336 --> 17:01.403
I'm not asking for that.

17:01.472 --> 17:03.572
But James... he's missing.

17:03.674 --> 17:06.508
I want you to help me find him.

17:06.609 --> 17:08.010
Ah.

17:08.079 --> 17:10.779
And what would you offer me
for this little feat of magic?

17:10.848 --> 17:12.748
I have nothing to offer.

17:12.849 --> 17:14.383
Not much of a negotiator, are you?

17:17.821 --> 17:18.921
You owe me.

17:19.022 --> 17:20.222
So...

17:22.726 --> 17:25.127
you finally grew a spine.

17:27.631 --> 17:29.954
I think I finally became a father.

17:29.960 --> 17:32.226
I'd do anything to see my boy...

17:32.436 --> 17:34.336
and tell him I'm...

17:36.073 --> 17:37.547
I'm sorry.

17:39.076 --> 17:41.243
You know, I don't have
time for maudlin stories.

17:41.312 --> 17:44.012
And everything has a price.

17:44.081 --> 17:47.449
Although I-I could be persuaded
to help you in exchange for,

17:47.518 --> 17:49.985
uh... one hair off your head.

17:50.087 --> 17:53.522
Small things can have great power.

17:53.624 --> 17:54.990
Fine.

17:55.456 --> 17:56.744
It's yours.

17:57.394 --> 17:58.393
[Giggles]

18:03.667 --> 18:05.100
Curious.

18:06.769 --> 18:09.403
The boy wasn't abducted at all.

18:09.607 --> 18:11.874
He ran away.

18:11.909 --> 18:14.176
But where he went to...

18:14.578 --> 18:15.610
you don't want to follow.

18:15.616 --> 18:16.445
Why?

18:16.547 --> 18:17.513
Where is he?

18:17.581 --> 18:19.982
In a land built from temptation.

18:20.050 --> 18:22.451
And I have an extra ticket in.

18:23.854 --> 18:25.686
Unh, hair first.

18:31.529 --> 18:33.762
[Giggles]

18:33.864 --> 18:37.459
Our second deal is now complete.

18:37.834 --> 18:39.034
Thank you.

18:39.136 --> 18:40.068
Mm.

18:47.674 --> 18:51.947
"Small things can hold great power."

18:52.049 --> 18:53.215
[Giggles]

18:57.955 --> 18:59.721
Someday...

18:59.790 --> 19:02.224
may we all be reunited with our sons.

19:16.140 --> 19:17.339
[Engine shuts off]

19:17.441 --> 19:19.041
[Car door shuts]

19:19.143 --> 19:20.876
Emma's here. Hurry up.

19:23.681 --> 19:25.914
Hey, love, what happened
to the canoe trip?

19:26.016 --> 19:27.115
Oh, Henry.

19:27.151 --> 19:28.450
I love him, but he
forgot the life jackets,

19:28.552 --> 19:30.452
and you're the one always
going on about boat safety.

19:30.554 --> 19:32.354
[Sighs] I can't let you in there.

19:32.423 --> 19:33.488
[Laughing] Why not?

19:33.557 --> 19:35.457
Because I just really desperately need

19:35.559 --> 19:37.726
- to kiss you right now.
- [Laughing] Hang on!

19:37.736 --> 19:38.860
You're forgetting something.

19:39.416 --> 19:40.091
What's that?

19:40.097 --> 19:42.831
My superpower... I
know when you're lying.

19:45.769 --> 19:47.402
What are you hiding from me?

19:49.340 --> 19:52.274
The truth is, um...

19:52.376 --> 19:54.509
I'm a bit out of sorts...

19:56.313 --> 19:58.013
- because of Archie.
- Archie?

19:58.115 --> 19:59.848
Y-Yeah, I paid the Cricket a visit

19:59.854 --> 20:02.188
because I needed to talk to him about...

20:04.655 --> 20:06.121
about you.

20:06.190 --> 20:07.432
Oh.

20:09.293 --> 20:12.327
I thought you were gonna die.

20:12.396 --> 20:15.731
And that does something to a man.

20:15.799 --> 20:20.035
It changes the way he
thinks about things...

20:20.137 --> 20:21.336
about us...

20:31.207 --> 20:33.749
And he reminded me how important it was

20:33.817 --> 20:35.751
to share my feelings.

20:35.853 --> 20:37.386
And I didn't want to let you in the shed

20:37.488 --> 20:39.788
without sharing them, so...

20:39.857 --> 20:41.356
feelings shared.

20:41.458 --> 20:44.426
Well, I like feelings once in a while.

20:53.570 --> 20:54.736
[Sighs deeply]

20:54.838 --> 20:56.071
Now, why was I here?

20:56.362 --> 20:57.228
Life jackets.

20:57.234 --> 20:58.533
Right.

21:05.149 --> 21:06.682
Come on. Good work.

21:06.784 --> 21:08.250
- Didn't feel good.
- Well, it was.

21:08.352 --> 21:10.585
Now let's find out
who murdered my father.

21:13.977 --> 21:15.856
Robin: My hand's really not that bad.

21:15.862 --> 21:17.529
Regina: I didn't bring
you here for that.

21:17.598 --> 21:18.697
We need to talk.

21:21.168 --> 21:23.468
Were you really going
to kill Nottingham?

21:23.537 --> 21:26.137
Wait, you're not judging <i>
me</i> for that, are you?

21:26.173 --> 21:28.807
You told me it was your
curse that created this place.

21:29.452 --> 21:31.543
I mean... bloody hell, look around.

21:31.612 --> 21:34.479
I mean, wh-what's in these?

21:35.332 --> 21:36.248
Uh...

21:36.316 --> 21:39.559
The hearts of my enemies, but, I...

21:39.565 --> 21:40.651
Oh. And this?

21:40.657 --> 21:42.854
This looks nasty enough.

21:42.956 --> 21:44.155
Oh, no, don't touch it!

21:44.258 --> 21:47.073
It's... powerful.

21:51.598 --> 21:53.298
[Sighs]

21:53.611 --> 21:56.334
Yes, I know... I sound like a hypocrite.

21:57.842 --> 21:59.420
But I have changed.

22:04.911 --> 22:07.712
Which is why I have
to tell you something.

22:07.781 --> 22:09.214
[Sighs]

22:09.504 --> 22:12.638
The other Robin, he had a child.

22:12.644 --> 22:14.844
Well, two, actually,

22:14.850 --> 22:18.352
but only one is here...
an infant daughter.

22:18.914 --> 22:22.672
But, I mean, she's not
yours. Not... Not really.

22:22.678 --> 22:23.995
Does the mother know that?

22:24.511 --> 22:26.044
Who even is the mother?

22:26.186 --> 22:27.265
You?

22:27.764 --> 22:29.934
My sister.

22:30.003 --> 22:30.702
[Sighs]

22:30.804 --> 22:32.237
It's complicated.

22:32.306 --> 22:34.172
Apparently, everything
here is complicated.

22:34.274 --> 22:35.340
Did you bring me here

22:35.409 --> 22:37.442
just to drop me in the
middle of this mess?

22:39.000 --> 22:41.379
I hoped I could be a
part of a fresh start.

22:43.116 --> 22:44.582
Your fresh start.

22:47.487 --> 22:49.754
And maybe one of your own, too?

22:49.856 --> 22:51.222
Maybe. [Chuckles]

22:52.959 --> 22:53.992
I don't know.

22:54.061 --> 22:56.717
I think if we give ourselves a chance...

22:57.831 --> 23:00.031
maybe your being here
could be a good thing.

23:22.480 --> 23:24.719
Well, then...

23:24.725 --> 23:27.381
How about I show you more of the town?

23:38.338 --> 23:39.504
Well, according to the spell,

23:39.606 --> 23:41.039
this should show us where the coin was

23:41.108 --> 23:42.640
the day your father died.

23:42.743 --> 23:46.044
Okay, it says, "turn counterclockwise."

23:46.271 --> 23:47.236
Do you think they mean the beaker,

23:47.242 --> 23:48.475
or do we have to turn?

23:49.983 --> 23:51.082
It's better to be safe.

23:51.151 --> 23:52.117
Yeah. Right.

23:52.185 --> 23:53.151
All right.

23:59.393 --> 24:01.659
Well, that seems right.

24:06.785 --> 24:08.051
Careful.

24:08.057 --> 24:09.256
If you turn us into raccoons,

24:09.262 --> 24:11.006
driving that truck will be a challenge.

24:11.012 --> 24:12.011
[Chuckles]

24:19.374 --> 24:20.912
Fumes... I think we got it.

24:21.014 --> 24:22.747
[Both sniffing]

24:22.816 --> 24:24.048
[Gagging]

24:24.151 --> 24:25.216
That's, um...

24:30.494 --> 24:31.860
Right, the whole of the Enchanted Forest

24:31.866 --> 24:33.166
at your fingertips.

24:36.471 --> 24:39.505
Okay.

24:39.541 --> 24:40.940
Let's find out where my father was

24:41.009 --> 24:42.675
before he died.

24:47.182 --> 24:48.414
It's working.

24:53.955 --> 24:55.154
An island.

24:57.826 --> 25:01.327
I know this isle from
many nautical charts.

25:01.396 --> 25:04.597
It had dealings with Neverland.
I've never been myself.

25:04.699 --> 25:05.865
What is this place?

25:05.871 --> 25:07.737
Why would he be there?

25:07.902 --> 25:10.169
A terrible, dark place it is.

25:10.271 --> 25:12.105
It's called Pleasure Island.

25:15.043 --> 25:17.777
[Circus theme plays]

25:17.846 --> 25:19.812
[Laughter, indistinct conversations]

25:24.119 --> 25:25.985
[Bells dinging]

25:59.421 --> 26:00.653
No, thank you.

26:00.917 --> 26:02.950
I'm looking for my son.

26:21.142 --> 26:22.141
[Gasps]

26:22.243 --> 26:23.342
Oooh!

26:23.445 --> 26:25.645
Sweet holy...

26:25.747 --> 26:27.647
Is this worth something?

26:27.749 --> 26:30.416
Aye, the world, but only to me.

26:30.485 --> 26:32.085
It's a gift from my boy, David.

26:32.120 --> 26:33.920
Oh, let me guess.

26:34.022 --> 26:36.189
He ran away, and you're looking for him.

26:36.257 --> 26:37.657
Try the sugar pit.

26:37.726 --> 26:40.093
I'm actually looking
for my other boy, James.

26:40.161 --> 26:42.562
Have any of the boys
talked of being a prince?

26:42.664 --> 26:43.963
[Chuckling] A prince?

26:44.065 --> 26:46.632
Do I look like I was carved yesterday?

26:46.701 --> 26:48.968
You don't look like a king.

26:49.037 --> 26:51.170
He was my son before he was a prince.

26:51.272 --> 26:52.505
Have you talked to him?

26:52.574 --> 26:54.574
Nope. Not me.

26:56.211 --> 26:57.143
[Gasps]

26:57.212 --> 26:58.277
What the...

26:58.379 --> 26:59.345
[Chuckles weakly]

26:59.447 --> 27:00.379
What does that mean?

27:00.482 --> 27:02.515
Nothing.

27:02.617 --> 27:03.883
Does that mean you're lying to me?

27:03.985 --> 27:05.172
No.

27:06.087 --> 27:08.121
You know where my boy is.

27:08.223 --> 27:09.756
Tell me right now.

27:09.858 --> 27:10.857
Tell me!

27:19.968 --> 27:21.467
James?

27:21.569 --> 27:22.769
I've come to bring you home.

27:22.871 --> 27:23.751
I don't want to go!

27:23.757 --> 27:25.423
My father wants me to be a knight.

27:25.640 --> 27:26.672
I don't want to.

27:26.741 --> 27:29.175
- James...
- I don't want to kill things.

27:29.244 --> 27:31.210
What if I bring you to my home?

27:31.312 --> 27:33.426
It's green and nice there,

27:33.919 --> 27:36.449
and... you'll have a brother
to play with and grow up with.

27:36.518 --> 27:38.003
A brother?

27:38.983 --> 27:40.649
Yes, James.

27:40.655 --> 27:42.321
I'm also your father.

27:44.559 --> 27:45.458
Come on. Let's go home.

27:45.560 --> 27:46.893
Okay.

27:48.730 --> 27:49.796
Thank you.

27:49.864 --> 27:51.397
Glad I could help.

27:51.866 --> 27:53.099
Hey, there!

27:53.201 --> 27:54.433
Get out of here! Run!

27:54.769 --> 27:55.735
Stop!

27:55.837 --> 27:56.702
Go! Run!

27:56.805 --> 27:58.538
Come on, go! Go!

27:59.474 --> 28:00.706
Faster, go!

28:03.645 --> 28:06.412
Yeah, this is definitely the coin,

28:06.481 --> 28:09.248
and it was the last I saw of
him when he left with the boy.

28:09.254 --> 28:12.288
And, honestly, I never... I
never put you with him, David.

28:12.453 --> 28:15.321
He went after James.

28:15.390 --> 28:17.356
I thought he was just a drunk

28:17.458 --> 28:19.759
who fell prey to his temptations.

28:21.496 --> 28:22.895
He was trying to fix our family.

28:22.997 --> 28:25.164
He was stone-cold sober.

28:31.339 --> 28:33.973
David...

28:34.042 --> 28:36.442
a few years ago, I took some
pages out of Henry's book,

28:36.511 --> 28:38.477
and, uh... I never put them back.

28:38.580 --> 28:40.546
Pleasure Island is a part
of my story that I'm...

28:40.648 --> 28:43.349
I'm not exactly proud of.

28:43.451 --> 28:45.848
But I could look for them,
and we could see if, uh,...

28:46.004 --> 28:47.553
there's anything more about your father.

28:47.655 --> 28:49.322
Thank you. I appreciate that.

28:52.560 --> 28:53.893
[Door opens]

28:57.198 --> 28:58.965
I know who killed him.

28:59.067 --> 29:00.733
And he's still alive,
and I know where he is.

29:00.835 --> 29:02.635
Okay.

29:02.737 --> 29:04.237
You don't want me to
go after him, do you?

29:06.641 --> 29:08.941
You really have changed how
you feel about vengeance.

29:09.043 --> 29:10.109
Yes, I have.

29:10.211 --> 29:12.044
I didn't think you'd see it, but, yes.

29:12.146 --> 29:14.213
I would try and stop anyone
setting out on revenge

29:14.219 --> 29:15.690
if I could.

29:22.323 --> 29:25.458
[Engine starts]

29:25.560 --> 29:26.926
[Tires squealing]

29:31.279 --> 29:32.946
[Fog horn blares]

29:35.984 --> 29:37.951
Is that...

29:38.053 --> 29:39.285
You found him.

29:39.387 --> 29:40.854
You found my son.

29:40.956 --> 29:42.255
Please, let me reward you.

29:42.261 --> 29:43.327
No.

29:43.525 --> 29:44.737
Pardon me?

29:45.627 --> 29:48.494
Please... James...

29:48.597 --> 29:50.684
H-He doesn't want to be with you.

29:51.020 --> 29:52.121
Let him live where he'll be happy,

29:52.127 --> 29:53.499
where he started out...

29:53.505 --> 29:56.339
before Rumplestiltskin
took him... with me.

29:57.906 --> 30:01.941
You're the miserable wretch who
sold his own flesh and blood.

30:02.043 --> 30:04.878
You look older than
you should, shepherd.

30:04.946 --> 30:07.280
A conscience must be a terrible thing.

30:07.349 --> 30:09.983
I made a mistake, but
I'm making it right.

30:10.051 --> 30:12.218
I have him, and I'm not giving him back.

30:13.421 --> 30:14.564
No need for that.

30:14.570 --> 30:16.298
The right price fixed it last time.

30:17.064 --> 30:18.958
Don't let him take me.

30:25.400 --> 30:26.494
No.

30:27.669 --> 30:29.168
I didn't protect this
boy the first time,

30:29.174 --> 30:31.340
but I'm gonna do it now.

30:31.539 --> 30:32.538
Take him down.

30:32.641 --> 30:33.406
No.

30:36.544 --> 30:37.744
No.

30:37.812 --> 30:41.180
Guards, the reward for
finding the Prince is yours...

30:41.249 --> 30:43.349
- if you kill this man.
- No!

30:43.451 --> 30:45.652
And try to make it
look like an accident.

30:45.754 --> 30:46.786
No.

30:46.888 --> 30:49.322
Get your hands off me! Let me go!

30:49.424 --> 30:50.790
James!

30:50.859 --> 30:52.458
James!

31:07.943 --> 31:10.276
A visitor. To what
do I owe the pleasure?

31:15.216 --> 31:16.482
You killed my father!

31:16.551 --> 31:19.619
[Chuckles] Well, technically...

31:19.688 --> 31:22.355
I merely ordered him killed.

31:22.457 --> 31:24.257
I wondered if you'd work it out.

31:24.326 --> 31:27.193
You're an evil bastard.
He didn't deserve that.

31:27.295 --> 31:28.861
That's true.

31:28.964 --> 31:30.897
He was a good man in the end.

31:30.966 --> 31:33.967
I offered him temptation,
and he withstood it.

31:34.035 --> 31:36.202
I'll bet he was
imagining your little face

31:36.271 --> 31:39.172
when you opened the front door
and found him standing there,

31:39.178 --> 31:41.178
sober, victorious,

31:41.376 --> 31:44.143
with your brother in
his arms. [Chuckles]

31:44.840 --> 31:47.213
Instead, you got news he
died a drunken failure.

31:47.315 --> 31:50.083
[Sternly] Stop talking.

31:53.555 --> 31:55.388
Now fight for your life...

31:55.457 --> 31:57.090
if you think it's worth it.

32:08.903 --> 32:10.503
[Both grunting]

32:21.750 --> 32:24.145
What the hell?!

32:24.712 --> 32:25.878
No.

32:26.087 --> 32:28.621
[Panting] That bastard
admitted he killed my father!

32:28.723 --> 32:29.722
If you take this from me,

32:29.728 --> 32:31.528
I will never, never forgive you!

32:31.693 --> 32:34.994
[Breathing heavily] Yes,
he killed your father.

32:35.764 --> 32:38.532
But he also told you
about his final moments...

32:38.919 --> 32:41.130
that he resisted temptation...

32:41.136 --> 32:43.469
And it didn't work!

32:43.571 --> 32:44.921
He still died.

32:46.508 --> 32:47.740
I thought he didn't fight for us,

32:47.809 --> 32:49.275
but he did.

32:49.344 --> 32:51.878
[Voice breaking] He fought
with everything he had.

32:51.946 --> 32:54.313
He did the right thing.

32:54.416 --> 32:57.283
And it wasn't enough!

32:57.352 --> 32:59.052
So what if... what if Gideon

32:59.154 --> 33:01.154
comes back stronger and kills Emma?

33:01.256 --> 33:03.756
What if I can't be with Snow ever again?

33:03.825 --> 33:06.626
What if being "Prince
Charming" isn't enough,

33:06.694 --> 33:09.228
and I start losing...
and it keeps going,

33:09.330 --> 33:11.620
and I lose everything
that matters to me?!

33:12.721 --> 33:13.900
All right.

33:14.002 --> 33:15.810
I'll step aside.

33:17.038 --> 33:19.739
You can kill this man if you think...

33:19.808 --> 33:22.141
it'll make you feel stronger.

33:22.243 --> 33:24.343
But think about your father.

33:24.706 --> 33:26.879
He wanted to look you in the eye.

33:28.983 --> 33:31.617
Do you want to be able to look back?

33:41.996 --> 33:44.130
[Sobbing]

33:44.232 --> 33:46.099
It's all right.

33:48.570 --> 33:49.969
[Clatters]

33:55.611 --> 33:56.837
Ahh!

33:56.892 --> 33:58.359
Fine payment for a simple murder.

33:58.461 --> 33:59.927
[Thunder rumbles]

34:00.447 --> 34:02.125
There's a ravine near here,

34:02.131 --> 34:04.331
and everyone will think he
crashed during a supply run.

34:04.433 --> 34:06.200
Robert: They wouldn't believe it.

34:06.268 --> 34:08.369
They'll trace it back to you two.

34:08.471 --> 34:10.070
You think the king will defend you?

34:12.440 --> 34:13.522
I bet they'll believe

34:13.527 --> 34:15.208
a drunk drove his cart off the road.

34:15.311 --> 34:16.877
I'm not drunk.

34:20.516 --> 34:22.081
Really?

34:22.184 --> 34:23.851
Because to me, you smell like you...

34:23.918 --> 34:25.722
spent the night in the tavern.

34:27.156 --> 34:29.322
[Thunder crashes]

34:29.391 --> 34:32.359
Better not take a chance
he might survive the fall.

34:43.773 --> 34:45.706
[Sniffles]

34:54.449 --> 34:55.649
[Sighs]

34:59.238 --> 35:00.137
You okay?

35:06.128 --> 35:07.628
I think so.

35:07.730 --> 35:09.096
[Chuckles]

35:12.301 --> 35:14.601
I owe you an apology.

35:14.703 --> 35:17.104
You were the noble one, not me.

35:19.341 --> 35:22.843
And I'm sorry it cost you
more than I realized it would.

35:22.945 --> 35:27.481
And I'm sorry I risked what
you're making with Emma.

35:27.550 --> 35:28.982
So you think...

35:29.051 --> 35:30.884
I'm good enough for her?

35:30.953 --> 35:34.221
You've done the hardest
thing anyone can do.

35:35.958 --> 35:37.624
You've changed.

35:37.693 --> 35:40.594
And today, you saved me
from a terrible mistake,

35:40.663 --> 35:42.029
and I...

35:42.098 --> 35:43.263
I don't know if I'm gonna be able

35:43.365 --> 35:45.365
to pay you back.

35:48.270 --> 35:51.472
As luck would have it,
I might have an idea.

35:53.843 --> 35:56.777
There's one way for you
not to lose your family...

35:57.088 --> 35:59.880
and that's to let it grow.

36:01.584 --> 36:03.750
[Clears throat]

36:03.819 --> 36:05.986
David, may I have your blessing

36:06.055 --> 36:08.522
to ask for Emma's hand in marriage?

36:26.976 --> 36:28.041
Of course.

36:28.110 --> 36:29.643
[Laughs]

36:29.712 --> 36:31.278
Of course you have my blessing.

36:31.347 --> 36:32.746
Well, now, that is a relief.

36:32.815 --> 36:34.748
Well, I mean, it's
up to Emma, of course,

36:34.817 --> 36:36.750
but, yes, you have my blessing.

36:36.852 --> 36:38.519
Thank you.

36:38.621 --> 36:40.254
I didn't realize you
were so old-fashioned.

36:40.356 --> 36:42.156
Well, I am over 200 years old, mate.

36:42.258 --> 36:43.590
[Chuckling] Right.

36:43.692 --> 36:45.526
Right.

36:45.628 --> 36:47.194
Were you really that nervous?

36:47.296 --> 36:48.428
Why would I be nervous?

36:48.497 --> 36:51.231
"Prince Charming" doesn't
set the bar high at all.

36:51.300 --> 36:53.267
Well, I am overdue to wake up Snow,

36:53.335 --> 36:56.003
but I won't tell her the
news until it's official.

36:56.071 --> 37:00.073
I appreciate that, David.
I... I appreciate all of it.

37:06.248 --> 37:08.982
Snow: So, you talked
to Robin? How did it go?

37:09.575 --> 37:11.084
Did you tell him about the baby?

37:11.187 --> 37:12.586
I did.

37:12.688 --> 37:14.050
And, well...

37:14.056 --> 37:17.391
we sort of fought about it, and then...

37:17.618 --> 37:19.017
there was a kiss.

37:21.096 --> 37:22.796
And it was nothing.

37:24.466 --> 37:27.634
It was like kissing a photograph.

37:27.703 --> 37:30.137
Like it isn't him. [Scoffs]

37:30.206 --> 37:33.907
It just isn't, and... you were right.

37:34.009 --> 37:34.975
[Sighs]

37:35.077 --> 37:36.810
I'm sorry.

37:36.912 --> 37:38.812
I didn't want to be right.

37:39.864 --> 37:41.815
Well, it's not your fault.

37:41.917 --> 37:43.219
It's mine.

37:44.353 --> 37:45.686
I just wanted to believe.

37:48.257 --> 37:50.891
I mean... there has to be a reason

37:50.993 --> 37:53.393
he made it through that portal, right?

37:53.462 --> 37:56.396
And if I'm not the reason, then what is?

37:56.498 --> 37:58.699
The way I see it, he
made it through the portal

37:58.767 --> 38:01.034
because he has something
it recognized as real.

38:01.103 --> 38:04.905
Maybe it's not about
there being a reason why.

38:05.007 --> 38:06.540
Maybe it's just who he is.

38:06.642 --> 38:08.942
Well, he's certainly
not <i>my</i> Robin Hood.

38:10.145 --> 38:11.245
So...

38:13.015 --> 38:16.283
who is he, and what does he want?

38:20.504 --> 38:22.571
[Clangs]

38:29.704 --> 38:31.370
[Motorcycle approaching]

38:38.173 --> 38:39.940
[Engine shuts off]

38:40.042 --> 38:41.108
Hey, there.

38:41.176 --> 38:42.709
Glad I found you.

38:42.778 --> 38:44.511
Are you?

38:45.181 --> 38:47.114
What are those?

38:47.182 --> 38:50.584
I found the part of my
story I took out of the book.

38:50.653 --> 38:54.054
There's nothing in here I
didn't already tell you, but...

38:54.156 --> 38:57.157
I figured David might like
to have it for himself.

38:57.360 --> 38:58.906
Great. I'll pass them along.

39:00.562 --> 39:02.496
[Engine starts]

39:19.648 --> 39:22.482
Time to die... drunk.

39:24.053 --> 39:24.986
[Groans]

39:30.225 --> 39:32.025
Man: Captain, he's getting away!

39:37.966 --> 39:39.902
What've we got here, then?

39:40.669 --> 39:42.803
A pale wee man, hmm?

39:42.871 --> 39:45.264
Surrounded by the king's gold.

39:46.141 --> 39:48.975
The winds of fortune
are flying today, lads.

39:49.044 --> 39:50.911
For both of us.

39:50.979 --> 39:53.580
Thank you... for saving my life.

39:53.682 --> 39:55.482
Saving your life?

39:55.584 --> 39:57.517
Why would I go and do a
foolish thing like that?

39:57.619 --> 39:59.553
You saw me kill the king's men.

39:59.655 --> 40:01.355
No, you don't have to worry about me.

40:01.409 --> 40:03.142
I have no love for the king.

40:03.258 --> 40:05.826
Please, cut me loose.
I'll never say a word.

40:05.894 --> 40:08.295
I swear... on my son's life.

40:08.364 --> 40:10.864
I just want to get home to my family.

40:10.966 --> 40:12.532
That is a heartfelt plea, indeed.

40:12.601 --> 40:14.901
And you know, I actually
think I might believe that.

40:15.003 --> 40:17.003
But...

40:17.106 --> 40:18.939
dead men tell no tales.

40:23.145 --> 40:24.745
[Groans]

40:28.859 --> 40:30.392
Pack up the rest.

40:33.522 --> 40:34.921
And when you're done,

40:35.023 --> 40:37.891
find somewhere to hide this cart...

40:37.993 --> 40:40.227
and this poor departed soul.

40:42.731 --> 40:44.598
[Thunder rumbles]

40:50.572 --> 40:51.675
Emma: Hey.

40:51.681 --> 40:53.206
There you are.

40:53.308 --> 40:55.308
We just got back.

40:55.411 --> 40:57.244
I missed you.

40:57.346 --> 40:59.045
I'm making my specialty...

40:59.148 --> 41:00.213
microwave popcorn

41:00.315 --> 41:03.016
with Milk Duds mixed
in to get all melty.

41:03.118 --> 41:05.135
[Sighing] Sounds wonderful.

41:05.141 --> 41:06.153
[Chuckles]

41:06.255 --> 41:07.387
Um...

41:07.489 --> 41:08.722
I'll be in in just a minute.

41:08.824 --> 41:10.190
Okay.
