WEBVTT

00:00.473 --> 00:02.911
No. Please don't kill me. NO!

00:04.174 --> 00:06.242
Previously on "Famous In Love."

00:06.243 --> 00:08.211
You're it. You're my Lucy.

00:08.212 --> 00:10.413
If we work together,
we'll have a 50-50 split

00:10.414 --> 00:11.614
on ownership and territory.

00:11.615 --> 00:14.550
So you fine and smart.

00:14.551 --> 00:18.354
Clean oceans are trending.
And so are you!

00:19.389 --> 00:21.224
This is the best turnout
we've ever had.

00:21.225 --> 00:23.226
I know that you love this house

00:23.227 --> 00:24.560
but I'm just not ready.

00:24.561 --> 00:26.295
Well, I am.

00:26.296 --> 00:28.164
When this drops, it's gonna cause

00:28.165 --> 00:29.332
the shitstorm of the century.

00:29.333 --> 00:30.333
Oh, God. No.

00:32.336 --> 00:33.402
What is happening?

00:33.403 --> 00:35.204
'Is this about Jordan?'

00:35.205 --> 00:38.174
That he and Nina had an affair.

00:38.175 --> 00:40.542
- I wanted to tell you...
- Pack your stuff.

00:42.000 --> 00:48.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:52.356 --> 00:55.590
Babe, it's after 4 a.m.
and you never came to bed.

00:57.527 --> 00:59.594
Have you heard about this?

01:02.132 --> 01:05.134
Why are you looking
at pictures of jellyfish?

01:05.135 --> 01:06.302
Those aren't jellyfish.

01:06.303 --> 01:08.271
Those are plastic bags

01:08.272 --> 01:10.406
shoelaces, fishing nets.

01:10.407 --> 01:13.142
There's this massive island
of garbage.

01:13.143 --> 01:15.344
- The size of Texas.
- Rainer.

01:15.345 --> 01:18.147
We're going on five nights
of you not really sleeping.

01:18.148 --> 01:20.416
Just floating back and forth
across the Pacific Ocean.

01:20.417 --> 01:22.585
Okay, we need to talk
about what happened.

01:22.586 --> 01:24.320
Your mom and your best friend...

01:24.321 --> 01:27.423
I don't need to re-hash the
details of my mother's sex life.

01:27.424 --> 01:28.591
Okay, have you talked to Jordan?

01:28.592 --> 01:30.393
You asked him to give you a few days.

01:30.394 --> 01:31.594
It's been a few days.

01:31.595 --> 01:35.264
Jordan, Nina, that's
a bunch of crap I can't change.

01:35.265 --> 01:36.432
But there's an ocean of crap out there

01:36.433 --> 01:38.634
that I can do something about.

01:38.635 --> 01:43.172
Although, I should probably pull
out of the "Backsplash" reunion.

01:43.173 --> 01:44.473
Isn't that tonight?

01:44.474 --> 01:47.643
I'm just not into it anymore.

01:47.644 --> 01:50.179
Well, won't the press think
that you're just avoiding Jordan

01:50.180 --> 01:52.548
if you pull out of the reunion
this late?

01:52.549 --> 01:53.616
Seems like you have an opinion.

01:53.617 --> 01:56.452
Well, what do you think I should do?

01:56.453 --> 01:59.422
Well, if you really want
to help clean up the Pacific

01:59.423 --> 02:02.224
why not use the reunion
to talk about it?

02:02.225 --> 02:04.560
"Backsplash" was about
a bunch of kids in a beach town.

02:04.561 --> 02:07.430
Seems like a great platform
to say a few words.

02:07.431 --> 02:09.497
Maybe you can mention Trending Ocean.

02:09.499 --> 02:11.133
Drum up some new volunteers.

02:11.134 --> 02:14.236
But for now,
your call time's in a few hours

02:14.237 --> 02:16.172
so let's get some sleep.

02:16.173 --> 02:17.605
I'm wide awake.

02:19.209 --> 02:20.576
Ah. Though..

02:20.577 --> 02:23.579
I should probably
make some more coffee.

02:23.580 --> 02:29.892
Subtitle sync and corrections by
<font color="#FF0000"><b>awaqeded</b></font> for <font color="#FF0000"><b>www.addic7ed.com.</b></font>

02:31.521 --> 02:32.621
What's up?

02:38.161 --> 02:39.394
Rainer, come on.

02:41.398 --> 02:42.664
Hi, guys.

02:44.234 --> 02:46.301
Just grabbing a coconut water.

02:49.606 --> 02:51.340
Uh, excuse me.

02:51.341 --> 02:53.576
You know how many of those
things end up in the ocean?

02:53.577 --> 02:56.212
Jammed
in some poor dolphin's blowhole?

02:56.213 --> 02:59.447
Okay, DiCaprio. No straw.

03:04.287 --> 03:07.256
You wanna talk? Punch me or something?

03:07.257 --> 03:09.591
Why would I wanna do that?

03:14.331 --> 03:16.332
Tange, please.

03:16.333 --> 03:18.267
I have a lot to explain

03:18.268 --> 03:20.169
'and even more to apologize for'

03:20.170 --> 03:22.371
'but you gotta call me back, okay?'

03:22.372 --> 03:23.506
I really think we should clear the air

03:23.507 --> 03:26.308
before the "Backsplash"
reunion tonight, right?

03:26.309 --> 03:29.577
Please, just,
please call me back, okay?

03:31.415 --> 03:33.382
Last chance to tinkle
before we zip you in.

03:33.383 --> 03:35.184
Then we'll get you down
to hair and makeup.

03:35.185 --> 03:38.521
Uh, thanks, Brenda. Can you just
tell them I need a minute?

03:38.522 --> 03:40.489
Oh, no can do, doll.

03:40.490 --> 03:42.191
They're gonna be swamped down there

03:42.192 --> 03:45.394
with Rainer, Paige, and Jordan.
You're with second team.

03:45.395 --> 03:47.296
I'm not letting
that second-team person

03:47.297 --> 03:48.597
anywhere near my face.

03:48.598 --> 03:51.300
Her hands always smell like tuna.

03:51.301 --> 03:54.203
Can I be honest with you, hon?

03:54.204 --> 03:55.237
All the grips are taking bets

03:55.238 --> 03:57.373
on who's gonna curse you out first.

03:57.374 --> 03:59.308
Tangey has to push her call time back

03:59.309 --> 04:01.177
so that she wouldn't have to see him

04:01.178 --> 04:02.478
until after rehearsal.

04:02.479 --> 04:05.347
And I heard that Jordan asked to leave

04:05.348 --> 04:07.249
before they shoot your coverage.

04:07.250 --> 04:08.584
Well, at least,
Rainer's still talking to me.

04:08.585 --> 04:11.187
Who do you think
put you with second team?

04:11.188 --> 04:12.521
Is everyone really that mad at me?

04:12.522 --> 04:16.392
Well, that was quite
the little stunt you pulled.

04:16.392 --> 04:18.293
I know Alexalicious
is your thing right now

04:18.295 --> 04:21.130
but maybe if you could just act
a little bit more

04:21.130 --> 04:23.231
like Becky Burns from "Backsplash."

04:25.135 --> 04:29.304
All the gals at my AA meeting
thought you were just precious.

04:32.485 --> 04:35.277
Hm. Gardenia from Diptyque.

04:35.278 --> 04:36.545
These are my favorite candles.

04:36.546 --> 04:40.216
I know. I had my assistant
do some digging.

04:40.217 --> 04:42.251
All of this is supposed to put you

04:42.252 --> 04:44.253
in a creative mind frame.

04:44.254 --> 04:45.588
Question.

04:45.589 --> 04:48.591
Do you pace
when you're feeling creative?

04:48.592 --> 04:52.461
I tried to write new
lyrics, but I got nothing.

04:52.462 --> 04:54.263
We're just starting.

04:54.264 --> 04:57.166
Sometimes it take a minute
for a collab to jump off.

04:57.167 --> 05:00.169
[GRUNTS] I just, I hate
that I came unprepared

05:00.170 --> 05:01.470
especially
when I'm trying to take myself

05:01.471 --> 05:03.172
from Britney to Whitney. Come on.

05:03.173 --> 05:05.508
You mean, without the crack.

05:05.509 --> 05:08.410
Too soon. Okay?

05:08.411 --> 05:09.511
Too soon.

05:14.351 --> 05:16.417
- Uh..
- You should grab that, may..

05:19.122 --> 05:20.555
No. I'm good.

05:22.225 --> 05:24.260
Look, but I'm serious, though.
I really, I wanted..

05:28.431 --> 05:30.399
Like I was saying, I wanna move away

05:30.400 --> 05:32.168
from this bubblegum pop thing

05:32.169 --> 05:34.170
and really do, like a, an edgy, sexy..

05:35.372 --> 05:37.606
Somebody trying
to crash our party, huh?

05:37.607 --> 05:39.241
That's your man?

05:39.242 --> 05:41.377
No. It's my friend, Alexis.

05:41.378 --> 05:43.546
Talkin' about home girl
from that reality show?

05:43.547 --> 05:46.248
So the drama ain't just 40 cameras.

05:46.249 --> 05:49.251
No, and I'm supposed to be
with her at some event tonight.

05:49.252 --> 05:51.253
'I know she's trying
to apologize, but..'

05:51.254 --> 05:53.255
I don't wanna tell you what to do

05:53.256 --> 05:56.458
but if I was you,
I'd block that business.

05:56.459 --> 05:58.194
I mean, shorty already dragged you

05:58.195 --> 06:00.162
into enough of her nonsense.

06:00.163 --> 06:02.530
You know what? You're right.

06:05.435 --> 06:07.169
"Block that business?"

06:07.170 --> 06:09.270
It sounds like a song title, huh?

06:09.573 --> 06:11.307
Yeah.

06:11.308 --> 06:12.575
It could be a hot hook.

06:12.576 --> 06:16.212
Give me ten minutes and it will be.

06:23.119 --> 06:25.421
So, how long do
house inspections usually last?

06:25.422 --> 06:27.356
'Cause they've been here
for two hours.

06:27.357 --> 06:29.425
Well, apparently, they have to inspect

06:29.426 --> 06:32.194
every square foot,
including the attic.

06:32.195 --> 06:35.364
Until five seconds ago, I didn't
even know I had an attic.

06:35.365 --> 06:38.133
So can we talk about

06:38.134 --> 06:40.569
Jake not moving in here with you?

06:40.570 --> 06:43.205
- Did you guys get in a fight?
- No. Uh..

06:43.206 --> 06:45.608
I don't know. It's weird.

06:45.609 --> 06:49.311
Supposedly, we're fine, but ever
since the movie fell through

06:49.312 --> 06:51.280
he's just been kind of weird.

06:51.281 --> 06:53.249
This is just a bump, right?

06:53.250 --> 06:54.483
Yeah, of course.

06:54.484 --> 06:57.286
Besides, you know, he's got
a lot going on right now.

06:57.287 --> 07:00.556
Yeah, that's why I'm hoping
we can just find this Vera girl

07:00.557 --> 07:03.192
finish the movie and go back
to the way things were.

07:03.193 --> 07:05.327
- Well, let's get to it.
- 'Huh..'

07:06.363 --> 07:08.197
What's your Wi-Fi password?

07:08.198 --> 07:10.566
GDP 38 million.

07:10.567 --> 07:13.269
What? World's smallest economy.

07:13.270 --> 07:15.137
You can take the girl out of econ

07:15.138 --> 07:18.140
but you can't take econ
out of the girl.

07:18.141 --> 07:20.376
Gated smart-house,
hacker-proof password.

07:20.377 --> 07:22.144
You're adulting so hard right now.

07:22.145 --> 07:23.479
Thanks.

07:23.480 --> 07:27.316
"It's a good investment," says
my dad and my real estate agent.

07:27.317 --> 07:29.551
- 'That's Vera, right?'
- 'How did you do that so fast?'

07:29.552 --> 07:32.588
I spent a week at the diner
trying to get a lead on her.

07:32.589 --> 07:35.457
I am very good at seeing
what people are up to online.

07:35.458 --> 07:37.159
- 'Oh, but she's not tagged.'
- Yeah.

07:37.160 --> 07:39.295
Let's see if this person
re-posted from Insta or Twitter

07:39.296 --> 07:41.230
Maybe she's tagged there.
And there she is.

07:41.231 --> 07:43.265
- Mm. Ooh, look at the caption.
- 'On Tumblr.'

07:43.266 --> 07:46.302
She just got a new job
at The Sorcerer's Gallery

07:46.303 --> 07:47.503
and she starts tonight.

07:47.504 --> 07:49.438
Yeah, I heard that place
is really hard to get into.

07:49.439 --> 07:51.373
Let's see.

07:51.374 --> 07:54.209
"Members only.
Jackets and ties required."

07:54.210 --> 07:55.411
Wow. Fancy.

07:55.412 --> 07:57.579
I wonder if my new agent
can get us in.

07:57.580 --> 08:01.417
Hey, when you see Jake, do you
mind not mentioning it to him?

08:01.418 --> 08:04.286
I think I just wanna tell him
when we get on the list.

08:04.287 --> 08:06.288
Mm-hmm.

08:06.289 --> 08:09.425
And it only took me two minutes
and forty-eight seconds.

08:09.426 --> 08:12.127
Damn, you really are that good.

08:12.128 --> 08:14.129
Certified stalker.

08:18.368 --> 08:20.235
"Men's Fitness" cancelled.

08:20.236 --> 08:22.104
So did a half a dozen
other magazine covers

08:22.105 --> 08:23.238
you had scheduled.

08:23.239 --> 08:25.407
Fine. So we cancel, too.

08:25.408 --> 08:27.176
I'm not doing
the "Backsplash" reunion.

08:27.177 --> 08:29.111
All people are gonna ask me
about is the affair with Nina.

08:29.112 --> 08:31.246
It's not like that,
the host is Sebastien Graham

08:31.247 --> 08:32.414
who you've interviewed with before.

08:32.414 --> 08:34.450
All of the questions
have been pre-approved.

08:34.451 --> 08:36.184
I've got your PR team on a tight leash

08:36.186 --> 08:39.188
to make sure they keep this
a fun, light reunion show.

08:39.188 --> 08:41.323
You should go. It shows
you have nothing to hide.

08:41.323 --> 08:42.390
I don't know, man.

08:42.392 --> 08:44.293
Jordan, you can't just disappear.

08:44.294 --> 08:45.494
If you really want out of "Backsplash"

08:45.495 --> 08:47.596
I got to take offers
from the talk shows.

08:47.597 --> 08:49.264
- Good.
- But they all want you..

08:49.265 --> 08:51.367
To spill the details about the affair.

08:51.368 --> 08:52.501
There has to be some other way.

08:52.502 --> 08:55.137
Release a statement.

08:55.138 --> 08:56.538
Predator-prey,
spin the blame back on her

08:56.539 --> 08:59.308
and maybe we stay in the Oscar race.

08:59.309 --> 09:02.177
I'm not playin' it like that.
Don't bring it up again.

09:02.178 --> 09:03.412
Why do you keep pushing back on this?

09:03.413 --> 09:06.180
Because I don't want people
digging, alright?

09:09.386 --> 09:11.353
This Nina thing

09:11.354 --> 09:13.555
has people looking at me
way too closely.

09:13.556 --> 09:17.393
Jordan, is there something else
I should know? Anything?

09:17.394 --> 09:19.160
Whatever it is.

09:22.499 --> 09:24.433
There's nothing else.

09:24.434 --> 09:26.534
I just wish this will all go away.

09:37.253 --> 09:38.387
It's been like this all morning.

09:38.388 --> 09:40.322
"Variety," "New York Times,"
everyone wants a comment.

09:40.323 --> 09:42.391
- And you're telling them..
- No comment.

09:42.392 --> 09:44.226
And, uh, Rainer still hasn't returned.

09:44.227 --> 09:45.594
You want me to keep trying?

09:45.595 --> 09:47.396
L-let's let that breathe for a minute.

09:47.397 --> 09:50.265
I'm sure he's trying to avoid
the media on this mess, too.

09:50.266 --> 09:52.334
You know, I thought that finding
Jordan's birth certificate

09:52.335 --> 09:54.436
would put an 86
on this affair business

09:54.437 --> 09:56.405
but it keeps bubbling back up.

09:56.406 --> 09:57.573
What are the rest
of the assistants saying?

09:57.574 --> 09:59.575
I bought a round of shots
last night at Precinct

09:59.576 --> 10:01.410
and got the scoop.
Can I expense the shots?

10:01.411 --> 10:03.512
Of course not. Get to the point.

10:03.513 --> 10:05.247
The board's leaning towards a hard no

10:05.248 --> 10:06.548
on renewing your deal.

10:06.549 --> 10:10.285
Perception is reality in this town.

10:10.286 --> 10:12.621
I need it to look like I'm
leaving Gold Brothers by choice.

10:12.622 --> 10:15.257
Where are we with Steve Silver?

10:15.258 --> 10:16.592
'His office said
first avail is three weeks.'

10:16.593 --> 10:19.228
Breakfast meeting only.
Chiconi's or the Polo Lodge.

10:19.229 --> 10:21.330
Breakfast means
it's never gonna happen.

10:21.331 --> 10:22.498
I mean, he'll push twice

10:22.499 --> 10:24.266
and then shuffle me off his schedule.

10:24.267 --> 10:26.268
Well, didn't you work with
Steve Silver on "Backsplash?"

10:26.269 --> 10:27.603
It was my first producer credit.

10:27.604 --> 10:30.205
And we spent
the next five seasons arguing.

10:30.206 --> 10:33.308
But, if it gets me out of here
on my own terms..

10:33.309 --> 10:36.478
You know what? Change my RSVP to yes.

10:36.479 --> 10:39.581
I'll do a casual run in
and try to choke down my rage

10:39.582 --> 10:41.650
at his chauvinistic privilege.

10:41.651 --> 10:43.385
But what can we do about these?

10:43.386 --> 10:45.354
On the books, 4:15 with Natasha.

10:45.355 --> 10:47.289
You're good.

10:47.290 --> 10:48.390
Bring me the receipt to those drinks

10:48.391 --> 10:51.293
and I'll... reimburse you.

10:51.294 --> 10:53.295
You know, if it's easier, we can
just get me a corporate card.

10:53.296 --> 10:55.630
- Don't push it, Brian.
- It's worth a try.

11:00.537 --> 11:03.272
I got a 20 on her, she's
good to go in the fat suit.

11:03.273 --> 11:05.641
Ms. Glenn, they're ready for
you in hair and makeup.

11:20.657 --> 11:22.257
Nancy and the rest are good kids

11:22.258 --> 11:24.226
but Alexis is gonna
get herself blackballed.

11:24.227 --> 11:26.662
Somebody who treats her friends
like that, it's pathetic.

11:30.500 --> 11:32.334
Where are you going?

11:32.335 --> 11:33.569
'Ms. Glenn, I'm sorry.'

11:33.570 --> 11:36.305
'We really need you
in the makeup chair.'

11:36.306 --> 11:37.639
Well, they can wait all damn day

11:37.640 --> 11:39.408
because I'm not coming out
of this trailer

11:39.409 --> 11:42.476
until someone writes me out
of this frickin' fat suit!

11:45.515 --> 11:47.481
- Thanks again.
- 'You're welcome.'

11:49.519 --> 11:52.421
Is it me or were these auditions
like having your toe sawed off

11:52.422 --> 11:53.622
with a plastic knife?

11:53.623 --> 11:55.490
- They weren't that bad.
- They weren't good.

11:57.460 --> 11:59.461
I just wish I had a minute
and a half to stop everything

11:59.462 --> 12:00.629
and come up with a new game plan.

12:00.630 --> 12:03.599
I've got to find
a new apartment, roommates..

12:03.600 --> 12:06.401
Are you sure you don't wanna
just live with Paige?

12:06.402 --> 12:08.470
I'm not saying never. Just not now.

12:08.471 --> 12:11.373
Okay, no offense,
but totally right now.

12:11.374 --> 12:12.474
You're swamped with your movie

12:12.475 --> 12:14.443
you're also kind of homeless, Jake.

12:14.444 --> 12:17.446
What's the real reason why you
don't wanna move in with Paige?

12:17.447 --> 12:20.182
I just really need to focus on
"Stealing Georgia" right now.

12:20.183 --> 12:21.450
Would it help you focus

12:21.451 --> 12:25.187
if I could offer you a sunny spot

12:25.188 --> 12:28.357
with a comfy place to sleep
and two very cool roommates

12:28.358 --> 12:30.258
who I think
you'd be really happy with?

12:30.259 --> 12:32.493
That is a pretty decent couch.

12:36.332 --> 12:38.333
No. No, I can't.

12:38.334 --> 12:40.335
Just until your movie's done.

12:40.336 --> 12:43.438
Adam works long hours,
I'm gonna be on set

12:43.439 --> 12:45.540
and you'd have the whole place
to yourself

12:45.541 --> 12:47.442
and you can edit in peace.

12:53.316 --> 12:56.551
"Meet me at Gold Brothers.
Dress up. I've got a surprise."

12:56.552 --> 12:58.520
- From Paige.
- Hm.

12:58.521 --> 13:01.356
I've no idea what that's about.

13:01.357 --> 13:04.359
But you should wear a jacket and tie.

13:04.360 --> 13:06.294
Are you serious? What's going on?

13:08.564 --> 13:10.565
That's the lane right here.
What you think?

13:10.566 --> 13:14.269
This beat is exactly
what I'm looking for.

13:14.270 --> 13:17.472
♪ Have you lost your mind
so I lost them digits ♪

13:17.473 --> 13:20.342
♪ I had to block the business

13:20.343 --> 13:23.345
- Whoo! I like that.
- Something like that, right?

13:23.346 --> 13:26.348
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on.

13:26.349 --> 13:29.451
Your little friend trying
to start a Twitter war, huh?

13:29.452 --> 13:32.554
"@TangeyT,
too bad Pablo Money can't remiss

13:32.555 --> 13:34.523
your Tennessee flow."

13:34.524 --> 13:37.691
That's how she poppin' off? And
she put my name in the midst?

13:41.597 --> 13:44.199
You know what? Maybe you should
take a second with all of that.

13:44.200 --> 13:45.534
No, P. Look, look, wait.

13:45.535 --> 13:48.603
Look, I can either
let her drama shut me down

13:48.604 --> 13:50.671
or I can turn it into a second verse.

13:55.211 --> 13:56.443
I'll respect that.

13:57.647 --> 14:01.183
- Let's get to work, then.
- Let's get to work, then!

14:01.184 --> 14:03.285
Hit it.

14:03.286 --> 14:05.187

14:05.188 --> 14:06.588

14:09.158 --> 14:12.493
Ooh, I like that.

14:13.429 --> 14:14.429
Yes, it's a last-minute thing.

14:14.430 --> 14:15.564
Just pull some choices

14:15.565 --> 14:18.532
and I'll pop by
the wardrobe trailer to pick.

14:20.203 --> 14:21.570
Nina, there's a situation.

14:23.172 --> 14:24.439
'You can't do this, Nina!'

14:24.440 --> 14:27.209
'They're making me sweat
like hot yoga.'

14:27.210 --> 14:30.479
'And the foam just sucks it up
and the smell just lingers.'

14:30.480 --> 14:33.348
Ugh! I want out
of this sticky fat suit!

14:33.349 --> 14:34.449
After everything you've pulled

14:34.450 --> 14:36.485
you have the nerve to make demands?

14:36.486 --> 14:38.353
'The only thing I'm
demanding is a better ending'

14:38.354 --> 14:40.388
to this stupid movie, Nina.

14:40.389 --> 14:43.425
Maggie is stuck on a deserted
island for most of the third act

14:43.426 --> 14:46.228
living off of coconuts and bugs, okay?

14:46.229 --> 14:47.562
She should be skinny at the end.

14:47.563 --> 14:50.632
When Noah and August
travel through time

14:50.633 --> 14:53.201
no time passes in the present.

14:53.202 --> 14:55.604
'You're lying half-dead
in a plane crash.'

14:55.605 --> 14:57.439
'At the end of the movie
you are rescued.'

14:57.440 --> 14:59.474
Still fat, but alive.

14:59.475 --> 15:02.144
This stupid movie makes zero sense.

15:02.145 --> 15:04.579
Get a screenwriter out here to
do a rewrite or I don't budge.

15:04.580 --> 15:07.516
Come out of that trailer
or I'll have security

15:07.517 --> 15:09.317
drag your fake fat ass out.

15:09.318 --> 15:12.154
You can drag me out, Nina,
but you can't make me act.

15:12.155 --> 15:14.256
Well, there's nothing new
about that, is there?

15:14.257 --> 15:15.656
Rewrite me thin, Nina.

15:17.160 --> 15:18.560
Get the electric department over here

15:18.561 --> 15:20.362
to turn off her power.

15:20.363 --> 15:23.464
If she doesn't come out
on her own, I'll sweat her out.

15:27.620 --> 15:29.488
Come in.

15:29.489 --> 15:31.423
'And on the left
you'll see the base camp'

15:31.424 --> 15:34.293
'for the blockbuster film, "Locked."'

15:34.294 --> 15:37.496
Whoa there, stud.

15:37.497 --> 15:39.398
Come here.

15:39.399 --> 15:42.301
'And she just opened escrow
on a $1.4 million-dollar gated house'

15:42.302 --> 15:44.236
'in Nichols Canyon.'

15:44.237 --> 15:46.605
- Is that..
- Yeah, studio tourists.

15:46.606 --> 15:48.440
They go by all day.

15:48.441 --> 15:51.577
Don't you think it's weird
that the studio tour guide knows

15:51.578 --> 15:53.679
I'm buying a house in Nichols Canyon?

15:53.680 --> 15:56.315
One-point-four million?
Did it really cost that much?

15:56.316 --> 16:00.318
Y-yeah, between closing fees
and insurance.

16:01.354 --> 16:04.623
So, when we move out of the Bixby..

16:04.624 --> 16:06.191
Yeah, uh, I was thinking

16:06.192 --> 16:08.193
I'd just crash
at Cassie and Adam's for a bit.

16:08.194 --> 16:09.294
Jake.

16:10.430 --> 16:13.632
Are you sure
you're okay couch-surfing?

16:13.633 --> 16:15.634
Yeah, it's only temporary.

16:15.635 --> 16:18.336
Besides, it's not like your
boyfriend won't spend the night.

16:20.173 --> 16:22.473
And I'll probably be at your
place half the time anyway.

16:26.613 --> 16:29.548
Why don't you just move in?

16:29.549 --> 16:31.416
Uh, why don't I let you get changed?

16:31.417 --> 16:33.218
And we should talk to somebody
about that tour guide

16:33.219 --> 16:35.587
on our way out. And where did
you say we're goin' again?

16:35.588 --> 16:38.290
I didn't say, actually.

16:38.291 --> 16:40.459
And slight change of plans.

16:40.460 --> 16:42.294
You said you just had one
scene to shoot today.

16:42.295 --> 16:44.630
I do only have one scene to shoot

16:44.631 --> 16:47.332
but we're holding
on account of some drama.

16:47.333 --> 16:48.467
- Rainer?
- No.

16:48.468 --> 16:50.469
Actually this time it's Alexis.

16:50.470 --> 16:51.635
Not surprising.

16:53.306 --> 16:56.441
Hey, you wanna fill me in
on, uh, this mystery evening

16:56.442 --> 16:58.510
and why I'm wearing a jacket and tie?

16:58.511 --> 17:00.479
My lips are sealed.

17:00.480 --> 17:03.582
But when I'm done with set,
maybe I'll tell ya.

17:03.583 --> 17:06.585
Um, do you want me to grab you
a chair at video village?

17:06.586 --> 17:09.453
Um, you know, I think
I'll just, uh, stay here.

17:10.623 --> 17:12.289
Okay.

17:23.636 --> 17:26.538
- What did you say to her?
- Whoa!

17:26.539 --> 17:28.373
I didn't know
there were cameras, okay?

17:28.374 --> 17:30.342
Look, I swear, if Alexis
has any more bombs to drop...

17:30.343 --> 17:33.412
Would you back the hell up
and give me a minute to explain?

17:33.413 --> 17:37.182
Jordan, I didn't know
there were cameras.

17:37.183 --> 17:39.184
I never meant
for any of this to happen.

17:39.185 --> 17:40.485
It was all Alexis and my mom.

17:40.486 --> 17:42.220
She conned me
into signing a release form.

17:42.221 --> 17:44.323
So whatever you said to Alexis
with those cameras rolling

17:44.324 --> 17:46.191
they can use on TV whenever they want?

17:46.192 --> 17:48.327
No, I didn't tell her about that.

17:48.328 --> 17:51.563
Come on. I wouldn't. I swear.

17:51.564 --> 17:54.399
Rainer explained everything to me, J.

17:54.400 --> 17:56.335
I know you saved your mom's life.

17:56.336 --> 17:57.369
- You did the right thing.
- Yeah, well..

17:57.370 --> 17:58.603
Tell that to the attorney general

17:58.604 --> 18:00.238
of the state of Illinois.

18:00.239 --> 18:02.374
Murder is murder, Tangey,
I could go to jail.

18:02.375 --> 18:04.576
Jordan, no one's going
to find out about that. Okay?

18:04.577 --> 18:07.379
Recycling goes in the blue bin!

18:07.380 --> 18:09.614
Dude, it's right next to the trash.

18:09.615 --> 18:13.552
Daryl, it's not that hard, man.
Come on, please? For me..

18:13.553 --> 18:16.221
Oh, my God, I don't know how
any of us are gonna get through

18:16.222 --> 18:17.622
this "Backsplash" reunion tonight.

18:17.623 --> 18:20.359
Same. Last place I wanna be.

18:20.360 --> 18:22.627
And because of all this, Rainer
doesn't want me at the house.

18:22.628 --> 18:24.262
I camped out at the Bixby.

18:24.263 --> 18:26.598
Seriously?

18:26.599 --> 18:28.333
Of all the hotels in LA

18:28.334 --> 18:30.268
you choose the one that I'm living at?

18:30.269 --> 18:33.438
We can't be neighbors,
act like friends?

18:33.439 --> 18:35.506
I have to go over my lines.

18:45.318 --> 18:47.586
Work!

18:47.587 --> 18:50.354
Oh, come on. You're kidding me!

18:51.190 --> 18:53.392
Yeah. Oh, thank God.

18:55.194 --> 18:57.396
Oh..

18:59.432 --> 19:01.500
Get off of me!

19:12.545 --> 19:14.378
'Are you crying?'

19:16.215 --> 19:18.249
No.

19:19.419 --> 19:22.521
I can't go out there, Nina.
No one wants me here.

19:22.522 --> 19:25.323
I have pissed off all my friends.

19:25.324 --> 19:28.627
I'd rather die
like a chihuahua in a hot car

19:28.628 --> 19:31.262
than face what I've done.

19:34.467 --> 19:36.201
'If I can take the
heat for my actions'

19:36.202 --> 19:38.602
'and still show up to work,
so can you.'

19:48.414 --> 19:50.649
And we're back, people!

19:50.650 --> 19:52.551
'Let's get the cast into wardrobe.'

19:52.552 --> 19:56.321
Guys, I'm really sorry
that I held everyone up.

19:56.322 --> 19:58.457
Well, I promised
to get everyone out of here

19:58.458 --> 20:01.593
in time for the "Backsplash"
reunion tonight.

20:01.594 --> 20:03.694
Well, I bet that's gonna be
a lot of fun for you.

20:21.414 --> 20:24.316
- You're not even watching.
- What? Yes, I am.

20:24.317 --> 20:25.684
Can't we just go to Big Wayne's?

20:25.685 --> 20:28.487
What? Dinner is included here.

20:28.488 --> 20:31.523
Prime rib.
You'd rather have buffalo wings?

20:31.524 --> 20:33.592
Look, I'm just not cool
with magic tricks.

20:33.593 --> 20:36.427
- I had a weird ninth birthday.
- 'Shh!'

20:37.396 --> 20:41.233
Jake, oh, stop. Come on. Just stay.

20:41.234 --> 20:43.535
I have a lot on my mind right
now and this isn't helping.

20:43.536 --> 20:45.604
Is this because of me
going back to work with Rainer?

20:45.605 --> 20:47.606
'Cause you were acting
really weird in the trailer.

20:47.607 --> 20:49.541
No, I'm fine, uh.. Uh..

20:49.542 --> 20:51.710
Uh, you keep acting weird
every time his name comes up.

20:51.711 --> 20:53.612
Yeah, 'cause I can't tell
what's pissing you off more

20:53.613 --> 20:55.514
the fact that I have
to go back to work with him

20:55.515 --> 20:57.516
or that I bought a house without you.

20:57.517 --> 20:59.584
I don't care
that you bought a house, okay?

20:59.585 --> 21:01.353
I-I'm glad that you can afford it.

21:01.354 --> 21:02.587
And I don't think my approval matters.

21:02.588 --> 21:04.656
I just think
that when we live together

21:04.657 --> 21:06.491
I should be able
to pull my own weight.

21:06.492 --> 21:09.393
Hey, we're trying to do magic here.

21:10.463 --> 21:11.463
Wait, isn't that..

21:21.440 --> 21:22.673
That was cool.

21:26.546 --> 21:28.312
We found her.

21:35.544 --> 21:38.379
Go ahead, fire me.
I never liked this job.

21:38.380 --> 21:40.448
I never signed on
to feed your magic pigeons.

21:40.449 --> 21:42.683
I left New York
to get away from pigeons.

21:42.684 --> 21:44.518
You two, are you stalking me?

21:44.519 --> 21:46.687
No, no, I-I'm the director.
Remember, you liked my script?

21:46.688 --> 21:47.722
Yeah, I know who you are.

21:47.723 --> 21:49.724
And you two just got me fired, again.

21:49.725 --> 21:51.392
I wouldn't have had to yell
if you guys

21:51.393 --> 21:53.527
hadn't been bickering
during the entire show.

21:53.528 --> 21:54.562
- We're so sorry.
- We're sorry.

21:54.563 --> 21:55.696
Sorry doesn't cut it, I don't know

21:55.697 --> 21:58.566
how many more lattes I can foam
to pay rent!

21:58.567 --> 22:00.701
I can barely make auditions as it is.

22:00.702 --> 22:02.470
But that's kind of why we're here.

22:02.471 --> 22:03.738
That's what we wanted
to talk to you about.

22:03.739 --> 22:06.374
Whatever you have to say, I am
so not in the mood right now.

22:06.375 --> 22:08.709
Wait, wait, hey, come on.
Just, h-hear me out.

22:08.710 --> 22:10.711
The only reason that we're
here is because of me.

22:10.712 --> 22:13.647
I had to go back to work
and now the movie that you love

22:13.648 --> 22:15.816
Jake's movie,
is suffering because of it.

22:15.817 --> 22:18.719
Jake really did love
your audition at the diner

22:18.720 --> 22:22.356
and he wanted to ask you if..

22:22.357 --> 22:25.393
...you would be the lead role
in his movie.

22:25.394 --> 22:27.361
Is she serious?

22:27.362 --> 22:29.630
Uh, yeah, absolutely, and now
that you have some free time..

22:29.631 --> 22:31.399
And if you're interested, of course.

22:31.400 --> 22:33.801
Are you kidding? I would love to!

22:33.802 --> 22:36.437
You quit his movie? Uh, uh,
well, how could you do that?

22:36.438 --> 22:38.472
- It's a great movie.
- Well..

22:38.473 --> 22:40.574
The role's yours, Vera,
if you want it.

22:40.575 --> 22:42.710
Of course I want it.
And by the way, it's Billy.

22:42.711 --> 22:45.479
- Billy London Schwartz.
- Paige.

22:45.480 --> 22:47.615
Vera was my diner-waitress persona.

22:47.616 --> 22:49.383
Oh, my God! This is great!

22:49.384 --> 22:50.584
I told you
how much I love your script.

22:50.585 --> 22:52.520
I'd be stupid to pass on
something like this.

22:52.521 --> 22:55.790
- No offense.
- That's a yes, right?

22:55.791 --> 22:57.725
- It's a hell-yes.
- Yay!

22:57.726 --> 23:00.394
- But I do have a few doubts.
- Uh, I'm-I'm open.

23:00.395 --> 23:01.662
And we have to do
some re-shoots, anyway, so..

23:01.663 --> 23:04.331
Well, I'm obviously not working
the second show tonight.

23:04.332 --> 23:05.599
If you wanna get together

23:05.600 --> 23:06.801
and talk it out, grab some coffee?

23:06.802 --> 23:09.470
Sure. Yeah, uh,
we can meet at the Bixby..

23:09.471 --> 23:10.604
- 'If that's..'
- That sounds great!

23:10.605 --> 23:12.807
I was gonna go watch
the "Backsplash" reunion

23:12.808 --> 23:14.742
with Cassie,
so I'll just go to her place.

23:14.743 --> 23:17.545
- Great.
- I'll meet you there.

23:17.546 --> 23:20.781
Thank you so much.
I'm so excited. Bye!

23:20.782 --> 23:24.752
- Oh! Oh, my God.
- There you go!

23:24.753 --> 23:27.421
I am so sorry, I-I had no idea

23:27.422 --> 23:28.756
this whole evening was about this.

23:28.757 --> 23:30.524
I wanted to help you
finish your movie.

23:30.525 --> 23:32.426
Look, I am sorry.

23:32.427 --> 23:35.496
Me buying a house
and asking you to move in

23:35.497 --> 23:37.665
at the same time is probably a lot.

23:37.666 --> 23:40.768
So I'm sorry if I was doing
too much too soon.

23:40.769 --> 23:43.504
Well, you're not too much.

23:43.505 --> 23:46.440
You're amazing, okay? Thank you.

23:51.780 --> 23:54.715
Yeah, I'm gonna cut from there
to there, um..

23:54.716 --> 23:57.517
And just go ahead and go check.
Thank you.

23:59.488 --> 24:01.755
- Hey, dad...
- Well, watch out for that one.

24:01.756 --> 24:04.658
I've seen him fire
assistants over cold coffee.

24:04.659 --> 24:06.760
It's been years.

24:06.761 --> 24:09.696
- Nina.
- Uh, Steve.

24:11.333 --> 24:12.766
And I actually quit caffeine.

24:12.767 --> 24:15.503
And this isn't my assistant.
This is my daughter.

24:15.504 --> 24:18.439
- Of course. Sloan!
- Hey.

24:18.440 --> 24:21.408
You really grew up at Yale.
You're very sophisticated.

24:21.409 --> 24:24.378
Thank you, Nina. Is, uh,
Rainer around by any chance?

24:24.379 --> 24:26.514
Yeah, I'm sure he's
around here somewhere.

24:26.515 --> 24:29.350
You know, I've been swamped with
meetings, so I haven't seen him.

24:29.351 --> 24:31.485
Uh, yet. Today.

24:31.486 --> 24:34.487
Okay, I'll just go look for him
while you two catch up.

24:36.424 --> 24:39.693
Well, that sure
is a nice beaded bracelet.

24:39.694 --> 24:41.529
My sister has one just like it.

24:41.530 --> 24:42.830
Ah. Thanks.

24:42.831 --> 24:46.634
I got it at a Buddhist retreat.
Amethyst, very grounding.

24:46.635 --> 24:50.536
Yeah, if you'll excuse me, I see
some people I need to talk to.

24:57.746 --> 24:58.812
Did you get my text about picking up

24:58.813 --> 25:00.748
sour gummies on the way?

25:00.749 --> 25:03.617
Wow, that's a lot
of freaking sour gummies.

25:03.618 --> 25:05.685
I thought I'd pick up dinner.

25:07.489 --> 25:08.756
Doesn't dinner come with the tickets

25:08.757 --> 25:10.524
at the Sorcerer's Gallery?

25:10.525 --> 25:12.393
Mm-hmm, but we didn't eat.

25:12.394 --> 25:14.428
- Oh, you didn't find her?
- No, we did.

25:14.429 --> 25:16.630
Oh, you did? That's great.
Uh, where's Jake?

25:16.631 --> 25:19.333
He's, uh, working on the script
right now with Billy.

25:19.334 --> 25:21.402
- Who?
- Her name isn't actually Vera.

25:21.403 --> 25:22.603
It's Billy.

25:22.604 --> 25:24.705
I was thinking, after we watch
the "Backsplash" reunion

25:24.706 --> 25:26.373
we could go over to the Bixby

25:26.374 --> 25:27.741
and have a drink with them by the bar.

25:27.742 --> 25:31.679
But first, our favorite $12 champagne

25:31.680 --> 25:34.715
because you just got cast
in a huge horror film.

25:34.716 --> 25:38.619
Cassie, this is the beginning
of a very big career for you.

25:38.620 --> 25:41.488
We have to celebrate
every step along the way

25:41.489 --> 25:44.425
with... sour gummies!

25:44.426 --> 25:45.626
Yes.

25:45.627 --> 25:48.594
I know, you thought I forgot.

25:49.698 --> 25:51.799
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

25:51.800 --> 25:54.435
You're seriously the best.

25:57.639 --> 26:00.641
We have Rainer Devon as Chip Donahue

26:00.642 --> 26:02.776
and Aaron Michael James
and Sheila Stroud

26:02.777 --> 26:04.778
as Bodie Granger and Aunt Susan.

26:09.417 --> 26:10.751
'You know, watching that clip, guys'

26:10.752 --> 26:13.721
'really reminds me of how close
you all were as a cast.'

26:13.722 --> 26:15.389
Jordan and Rainer

26:15.390 --> 26:16.757
you guys were best friends
before the show started

26:16.758 --> 26:18.359
but I heard recently that...

26:18.360 --> 26:19.493
I thought
we weren't gonna talk about...

26:19.494 --> 26:22.496
I think he means the house
we shared in Malibu.

26:22.497 --> 26:24.798
Actually, Jordan just moved out.

26:24.799 --> 26:26.600
I live with my girlfriend now.

26:26.601 --> 26:27.668
- 'Aww!'
- 'Aww!'

26:27.669 --> 26:30.504
- 'And what about you, Jordan?'
- Uh, well..

26:30.505 --> 26:33.507
I guess I'm just a single
man doing my thing.

26:34.743 --> 26:36.677
'He's a single man, ladies.'

26:36.678 --> 26:39.546
- Whoo!
- 'Tangey.'

26:39.547 --> 26:41.682
- You played Felicia Miller.
- I did.

26:41.683 --> 26:45.586
'A rival who bumped heads
with Becky Barnes.'

26:45.587 --> 26:48.422
Wasn't that supposed to be
a three-episode arc?

26:48.423 --> 26:51.358
Yeah, well, people
really loved the chemistry

26:51.359 --> 26:53.460
between our characters, so they
made me a series regular.

26:53.461 --> 26:55.663
- That was some chemistry.
- 'Yeah.'

26:55.664 --> 26:59.433
Well, what can I say,
as far as Felicia's concerned

26:59.434 --> 27:01.702
- Becky Barnes was easy to hate.
- 'And there you have it.'

27:01.703 --> 27:04.371
'We're gonna go
from conflict to comedy'

27:04.372 --> 27:07.541
with more "Backsplash" reunion
right after the break.

27:15.650 --> 27:18.452
'Oh, my God! Sloanie-baloney.'

27:18.453 --> 27:19.753
- Hi. Hi. How are you?
- Hi!

27:19.754 --> 27:21.722
- Oh, I missed you
- I missed you guys, too.

27:21.723 --> 27:23.724
So are you finally back from Harvard?

27:23.725 --> 27:26.660
Uh, Yale, actually, magna
cum laude, but whatever.

27:26.661 --> 27:29.530
Ooh, good for you, smarty-pants.

27:29.531 --> 27:30.698
So I know it's been a minute

27:30.699 --> 27:32.800
but you think you can help me
convince your dad

27:32.801 --> 27:34.635
to do me a teensy-tiny little favor?

27:34.636 --> 27:36.370
Yeah, of course. What's up?

27:36.371 --> 27:38.472
So I was counting on some good
B-roll for Alexalicious

27:38.473 --> 27:41.642
but everyone's being super lame.
Complete saga.

27:41.643 --> 27:43.510
- It's kind of my fault.
- Right.

27:43.511 --> 27:45.646
Uh, but would you help me convince him

27:45.647 --> 27:48.549
to play the hurricane clip
from season three?

27:48.550 --> 27:50.551
Yeah, of course, Alex, happy to help.

27:50.552 --> 27:53.387
- Ah.
- You know, I idolize you guys.

27:53.388 --> 27:55.389
When I was little, I wanted
to be on camera with you

27:55.390 --> 27:56.657
just so bad.

27:56.658 --> 27:58.726
Well, do me this favor and I'll
get you a cameo on my show.

27:58.727 --> 28:00.726
- Deal.
- Yes!

28:01.429 --> 28:02.562
Bye.

28:03.698 --> 28:05.532
So if you make that small adjustment

28:05.533 --> 28:07.634
the dialogue back on page five
makes a ton more sense.

28:07.635 --> 28:09.303
I thought you said a few notes.

28:09.304 --> 28:11.505
Just bear with me,
we're almost at the second act.

28:11.506 --> 28:14.408
Um, I think you should scrap
the seduction scene.

28:14.409 --> 28:17.411
I don't think it's working
the way you intended it to work.

28:17.412 --> 28:18.412
That scene is supposed to be

28:18.413 --> 28:20.314
how she gets him to do what she wants.

28:20.315 --> 28:22.716
He's a bored husband
and a mid-level bank manager.

28:22.717 --> 28:24.785
Georgia prefers excitement, taboo.

28:24.786 --> 28:26.453
Yeah, it's in the subtext.

28:26.454 --> 28:28.555
You're making a movie, show me.

28:28.556 --> 28:30.557
And stop arguing so much.

28:30.558 --> 28:31.658
If my notes weren't good,
you would have stopped

28:31.659 --> 28:33.726
writing them down ten minutes ago.

28:38.533 --> 28:40.467
Okay. So what's the pitch?

28:40.468 --> 28:42.736
- Ever seen "Joy House?"
- With Jane Fonda?

28:42.737 --> 28:44.404
You're maybe
the second person I've met

28:44.405 --> 28:45.806
who's even heard of that film.

28:45.807 --> 28:47.674
My dad's a film professor at Columbia

28:47.675 --> 28:49.810
and my other dad is a critic
for "The Village Voice."

28:49.811 --> 28:52.379
They named me after Billy Wilder.

28:52.380 --> 28:54.319
Name a movie I haven't watched.

28:54.320 --> 28:55.945
So you're thinking of an
homage to the mirror scene.

28:55.946 --> 28:57.046
Exactly.

28:58.787 --> 29:00.820
Give me a sec, I think I have an idea.

29:05.360 --> 29:06.426
This next clip was supposed to feature

29:06.427 --> 29:08.362
our favorite guest star, Duke Zuma,

29:08.363 --> 29:09.530
but, instead, we're gonna roll a clip

29:09.531 --> 29:11.431
that almost slipped under the radar.

29:11.432 --> 29:15.468
This is from a time when
a hurricane hit Clementine Cove.

29:21.743 --> 29:23.443
This is bad, guys.

29:23.444 --> 29:25.746
Hurricane Hazel's a category six!

29:25.747 --> 29:27.381
Maybe I should call go help!

29:27.382 --> 29:28.582
No!

29:30.518 --> 29:34.354
Felicia, there's something
I have to confess.

29:34.355 --> 29:36.390
'It was me who super-glued
your locker shut'

29:36.391 --> 29:38.492
so you couldn't get your pom-poms.

29:38.493 --> 29:42.529
Well, if we're being 100% honest

29:42.530 --> 29:45.599
your Spanx didn't shred themselves.

29:45.600 --> 29:48.802
I just had to get that off my
chest before we get blown away.

29:48.803 --> 29:51.505
I'm sorry I borrowed your board
without asking.

29:51.506 --> 29:54.441
No problem, dude.
I'm sorry I tried to date Becky.

29:54.442 --> 29:56.443
- I know you like her.
- It's okay, man.

29:56.444 --> 29:57.778
'Date her if
you want, she's not worth'

29:57.779 --> 29:59.446
'losing our friendship over'

29:59.447 --> 30:01.548
especially with varsity
surf team in state finals.

30:02.684 --> 30:04.451
Boom.

30:04.452 --> 30:06.753
Promise me, if we make it out alive

30:06.754 --> 30:10.457
we'll be co-captains of the
cheerleading squad next year.

30:10.458 --> 30:12.526
- Pinky promise!
- 'Aww.'

30:12.527 --> 30:14.528
And even if we don't make it

30:14.529 --> 30:16.697
at least we'll die as friends.

30:16.698 --> 30:19.433
- 'Aww!'
- 'Come on..'

30:19.434 --> 30:21.635
'I love you guys!'

30:21.636 --> 30:23.770
Friends forever!

30:37.785 --> 30:39.453
- That was close.
- Ha-ha.

30:39.454 --> 30:41.855
- Yes. Good job!
- Yes. Good job!

30:50.598 --> 30:52.566
Whoo!

30:52.567 --> 30:55.502
I just have to say,
I think over the years

30:55.503 --> 30:59.538
Tangey and I have weathered
a lot of Hurricane Hazels.

31:01.542 --> 31:04.577
Friends forever. Pinky promise.

31:05.647 --> 31:06.813
'Hey-hey, Jordan.'

31:06.814 --> 31:08.774
'What was it like to bang
your best friend's mom?'

31:13.488 --> 31:16.356
What? Uh, uh, I can't comment on that.

31:16.357 --> 31:18.457
Jordan can't say anything about that..

31:20.828 --> 31:22.496
...but I can.

31:31.328 --> 31:33.730
I'm sure people want details

31:33.731 --> 31:37.533
about who is doing what with who.

31:37.534 --> 31:40.436
Is that really the most
important thing to worry about?

31:49.680 --> 31:51.681
I wish that all of you

31:51.682 --> 31:53.583
that everyone in this room..

31:53.584 --> 31:54.584
Rainer, Rainer...

31:54.585 --> 31:56.452
...would take responsibility

31:56.453 --> 31:58.520
for what they put out in the world.

31:59.556 --> 32:02.659
Jordan, you and Nina

32:02.660 --> 32:05.295
Tangey and Alexis

32:05.296 --> 32:07.664
you're all to blame.

32:07.665 --> 32:09.798
It's time to clean up your mess!

32:12.269 --> 32:23.279
Well, but there's something we can do.

32:23.280 --> 32:24.479
We can all do.

32:26.684 --> 32:29.686
I'm donating my appearance
fee from this reunion show

32:29.687 --> 32:32.587
$10,000 to Trending Ocean.

32:33.691 --> 32:36.526
I hope all my co-stars

32:36.527 --> 32:38.693
all the producers join in.

32:40.331 --> 32:41.597
Folks at home

32:41.598 --> 32:44.767
I'll match donations from
our website, trendingocean.com

32:44.768 --> 32:47.370
up to a million dollars.

32:47.371 --> 32:49.439
Yeah? Sound good?

32:49.440 --> 32:50.540
This is our world, people.

32:50.541 --> 32:53.509
Step up. Take responsibility!

32:53.510 --> 32:55.345
Come on. Come on.

32:55.346 --> 32:58.381
Thank you! Thank you!

32:58.382 --> 32:59.549
Thank you.

32:59.550 --> 33:02.618
And on that uplifting note,
we're out of time.

33:02.619 --> 33:05.355
Rainer, a million dollars?
That seems reckless, uh..

33:05.356 --> 33:06.522
Out of control.

33:06.523 --> 33:08.790
Wanna make sure
you're focused on your recovery.

33:11.395 --> 33:13.296
Funny thing about recovery.

33:13.297 --> 33:16.332
Getting clean
means cleaning up my world.

33:16.333 --> 33:18.534
Can we talk, Rainer? About
what happened with Jordan..

33:18.535 --> 33:20.403
I feel like
I owe you an explanation...

33:20.404 --> 33:21.604
Please, don't explain, Nina.

33:21.605 --> 33:24.540
I don't need to know how or why.

33:24.541 --> 33:27.377
Your life is a garbage island.

33:27.378 --> 33:30.545
If I wanna stay sober,
I've gotta get the hell off.

33:31.515 --> 33:32.647
Rainer?

33:35.586 --> 33:37.620
Yeah. Huh? Kids.

33:37.621 --> 33:39.522
Right?

33:39.523 --> 33:42.624
Hey, Nina, I'm here to listen
if you need me.

33:44.395 --> 33:47.330
I know what this did to you last time.

33:47.331 --> 33:49.465
I can't go through that again.

33:49.466 --> 33:50.599
I know.

33:51.568 --> 33:52.734
Hey, come on.

33:58.308 --> 33:59.776
Oh, my God. That was so awful.

33:59.777 --> 34:03.312
I mean, ugh, he must feel awful.

34:03.313 --> 34:05.381
I should, oh, I should call him.

34:05.382 --> 34:07.316
Don't be champagne stupid.

34:07.317 --> 34:08.351
We're about to meet Jake for a drink.

34:08.351 --> 34:10.420
You can't call and offer
emotional support

34:10.420 --> 34:11.621
to some other guy

34:11.621 --> 34:13.656
the guy that Jake
is already jealous of.

34:13.657 --> 34:15.491
- Oh...
- But just don't.

34:15.492 --> 34:17.493
He did seem kind of unhinged.

34:17.494 --> 34:18.561
I mean, I should at least

34:18.562 --> 34:22.264
just text Rainer, as a friend.

34:22.266 --> 34:24.300
As a friend,
Rainer will be just as grateful

34:24.301 --> 34:26.469
when you send him a thoughtful
text to see how he's doing

34:26.469 --> 34:29.571
tomorrow, when you're not
champagne stupid.

34:30.607 --> 34:32.706
Oh, wait. Look, there they are.

34:34.745 --> 34:36.344
- Hi, baby.
- Hey.

34:36.346 --> 34:37.513
Hey.

34:37.514 --> 34:41.284
Uh, Billy, this is Cassie.
She plays Zoey in the movie.

34:41.284 --> 34:43.351
- Tater Tots from the diner.
- Yeah.

34:43.353 --> 34:46.456
Or, actually,
I prefer Cassandra or Cassie.

34:46.456 --> 34:49.391
Billy has a great take on the
monologue at the end of act one.

34:49.393 --> 34:52.328
The one where Georgia seduces
Landon? I love that monologue.

34:52.329 --> 34:53.763
You guys have to hear this rewrite.

34:53.764 --> 34:57.333
Georgia stands behind Landon

34:57.334 --> 34:59.435
uh, in the mirror's reflection.

34:59.436 --> 35:01.571
My daddy was a necktie man.

35:01.572 --> 35:03.573
He sold used cars
wearing a vintage tie

35:03.574 --> 35:05.408
to put people at ease.

35:05.409 --> 35:08.244
He had this
fun, real skinny shark-skin tie

35:08.245 --> 35:09.579
for Saturday nights.

35:09.580 --> 35:11.314
'He'd wear that skinny tie loose'

35:11.315 --> 35:13.349
with his shirt unbuttoned at the neck.

35:13.350 --> 35:15.585
He'd go out, he'd drink
a little rye, meet a pretty girl

35:15.586 --> 35:18.488
and ask her to dance
a real slow two-step.

35:18.489 --> 35:20.589
'Georgia loosens his tie.'

35:22.526 --> 35:24.494
Unbuttons his shirt.

35:24.495 --> 35:26.494
One and then another.

35:27.431 --> 35:30.266
You're choking yourself, Landon

35:30.267 --> 35:33.569
day in and day out
with that polyester noose.

35:33.570 --> 35:36.606
When's the last time
you loosened up your tie?

35:36.607 --> 35:39.542
When's the last time you asked
a pretty girl to dance?

35:39.543 --> 35:41.610
Georgia pulls Landon in by his tie.

35:42.312 --> 35:43.546
Kisses him.

35:43.547 --> 35:45.347
He can't resist.

35:46.283 --> 35:47.515
I love it!

35:48.552 --> 35:51.454
It's good. Very good work.

35:51.455 --> 35:53.689
Great. It's great stuff.

35:53.690 --> 35:56.325
- Thank you.
- Cool. Thank you.

35:56.326 --> 35:58.294
Should we go get some drinks?

35:58.295 --> 36:00.362
- 'That's a good idea.'
- I'm so thirsty.

36:01.365 --> 36:03.533
I'm gonna help her..

36:03.534 --> 36:05.300
...with the drinks.

36:10.507 --> 36:12.275
Is it just me
or did Aaron Michael James

36:12.276 --> 36:14.442
get way cuter after he came out?

36:17.481 --> 36:20.583
Tange, um, what you said on air

36:20.584 --> 36:22.718
are we all made up?

36:22.719 --> 36:24.786
That clip was your idea, wasn't it?

36:26.323 --> 36:28.291
'Do you remember that day, Lex'

36:28.292 --> 36:29.659
how Ida yelled at me in my trailer

36:29.660 --> 36:32.395
criticizing my performance?

36:32.396 --> 36:35.364
'Did you seriously think that
clip would get us to make up?'

36:35.365 --> 36:37.466
'Cause all it did was remind me

36:37.467 --> 36:39.468
to perform in front of the cameras

36:39.469 --> 36:41.404
pretend we're friends for the show.

36:41.405 --> 36:44.440
I know I put you in a terrible
position using that footage.

36:44.441 --> 36:47.643
- And I'm really sorry, Tangey.
- Too little, too late.

36:47.644 --> 36:49.745
You could have tweeted me
an apology hours ago.

36:49.746 --> 36:51.480
Instead,
you were just making it worse.

36:51.481 --> 36:53.349
I just wanted you to talk to me.

36:53.350 --> 36:55.518
Like, I would ever

36:55.519 --> 36:58.753
dignify your stupid Twitter-war
with a response.

37:00.324 --> 37:02.724
I'm not gonna let you
manipulate me, Alexis.

37:04.494 --> 37:06.561
You're just as bad as my mother.

37:07.631 --> 37:09.698
You two deserve each other.

37:26.367 --> 37:27.428
'Are you okay?'

37:27.429 --> 37:30.631
No. She's changing everything.

37:30.632 --> 37:34.884
And don't you think
that scene was... bad?

37:34.885 --> 37:36.351
I-I kinda liked it.

37:36.865 --> 37:39.533
You know, it was very
"Drugstore Cowboy"

37:39.534 --> 37:41.602
Sam Shepard noir.

37:41.603 --> 37:43.703
Well, at least Jake is happy.

37:44.739 --> 37:46.573
I know this sucks.

37:46.574 --> 37:49.409
The part of Georgia
was written for me.

37:49.410 --> 37:51.478
And then he goes and he's
just gonna rewrite it

37:51.479 --> 37:53.714
for someone else? Like, uh..

37:53.715 --> 37:56.883
I'm so not onboard.
I wish he could just wait.

38:03.658 --> 38:06.727
Oh. Hey, Shane. I didn't know
you were working tonight.

38:06.728 --> 38:09.429
Yeah, I pull the closing shifts
all week.

38:09.430 --> 38:11.465
Here you go.

38:11.466 --> 38:14.368
- Ooh! Wow! Okay.
- Ooh.

38:14.369 --> 38:16.470
Can you comp a bottle this nice?

38:16.471 --> 38:19.740
Well, I wish I could.
It's an anonymous gift.

38:19.741 --> 38:22.409
'All I got was cash and instructions'

38:22.410 --> 38:25.679
to buy you a bottle of
our very best champagne.

38:25.680 --> 38:29.750
Oh, and I am supposed
to give you this.

38:29.751 --> 38:30.851
Thanks.

38:31.653 --> 38:32.753
'Hm.'

38:45.834 --> 38:47.600
'Rainer, hold up.'

38:49.437 --> 38:50.504
- He needs a minute.
- No, no, no.

38:50.505 --> 38:51.672
He needs to hear from me.

38:51.673 --> 38:54.441
He keeps saying he's okay.
That is not okay.

38:54.442 --> 38:56.777
Let Rainer manage his own emotions.

38:56.778 --> 38:59.580
You stepping in to make him feel
better won't make him better.

38:59.581 --> 39:01.548
It just keeps him dependent on you.

39:01.549 --> 39:04.518
- We need to talk.
- Yeah, and you will.

39:04.519 --> 39:06.719
On his terms, when he's ready.

39:07.655 --> 39:09.723
Until then, trust me

39:09.724 --> 39:11.624
I'll take good care of him.

39:28.676 --> 39:31.812
You know, your son, he may not
have wanted you here tonight

39:31.813 --> 39:34.648
but I'm glad you changed your RSVP.

39:34.649 --> 39:37.651
Come on, "Backsplash."
This was your baby.

39:37.652 --> 39:39.952
It wouldn't have been the same
without you here tonight.

39:41.823 --> 39:44.658
Would you consider talking about

39:44.659 --> 39:46.526
going into business together?

39:46.527 --> 39:48.595
I think that this time around

39:48.596 --> 39:50.697
maybe things could be different.

39:50.698 --> 39:51.798
You know, and whatever's good.

39:51.799 --> 39:53.533
I'll, I'll take that
breakfast meeting idea.

39:53.534 --> 39:55.435
You know what, y-you really
want things to be different?

39:55.436 --> 39:56.436
Yeah.

39:56.437 --> 39:58.538
How about I take you to dinner

39:58.539 --> 40:01.441
and we not talk business?

40:01.442 --> 40:03.777
Not talk about business at all?

40:03.778 --> 40:05.544
Not a word.

40:05.880 --> 40:07.480
Um..

40:08.816 --> 40:10.716
Yeah, I think I'd like that.

40:23.698 --> 40:26.633
I-I know this is uncomfortable.

40:26.634 --> 40:28.502
And I know you wanna get away
from my drama

40:28.503 --> 40:31.672
but movin' on hasn't been easy, Tange.
I've tried.

40:39.814 --> 40:41.947
- What floor?
- Uh, four.

40:45.586 --> 40:46.920
- Hey.
- Hi.

40:46.921 --> 40:48.689
I didn't like what went down today.

40:48.690 --> 40:51.858
I know. I'm sorry. That was
completely unprofessional.

40:51.859 --> 40:55.696
I'm not trippin' on that
little Twitter-beef situation.

40:55.697 --> 40:57.931
Just wanted to make sure
that you're okay.

40:57.932 --> 41:00.900
Yeah, I'm good. Thank you.

41:02.670 --> 41:04.670
Jordan Wilder, right?

41:05.606 --> 41:07.673
- Pablo.
- Hey, man.

41:08.776 --> 41:12.546
Look, I know I rolled up on you
unannounced.

41:12.547 --> 41:15.648
But... you wanna grab a drink with me?

41:19.887 --> 41:22.621
How 'bout you come upstairs
for a drink?
