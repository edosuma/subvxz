[Gossip Girl]
Gossip Girl here,
your one and only source

00:03.960 --> 00:05.701
into the scandalous lives
of Manhattan's elite.

00:05.788 --> 00:07.616
I mean, what's the one thing
that no one in our group has?

00:07.703 --> 00:09.922
I mean, not even Blair?
A boyfriend.

00:10.010 --> 00:11.141
I met this really nice guy,
and I'm supposed to meet him

00:11.228 --> 00:12.273
in the park for lunch tomorrow.

00:12.360 --> 00:13.752
You're not old enough to date.

00:13.839 --> 00:16.494
Name's Asher,
and I do go to Unity.

00:16.581 --> 00:18.235
[Lily]
He's been staying
at the Ostroff Center.

00:18.322 --> 00:21.151
It's depression? Is it bad?

00:21.238 --> 00:23.327
Bad enough
to try to kill himself.

00:23.414 --> 00:25.460
Oh, my God. Georgina.
What are you doing here?

00:25.547 --> 00:28.158
Well, I told you I was coming.
Didn't you get my gifts?

00:28.245 --> 00:31.335
What's Georgina got on you?
Dan, I understand.

00:31.422 --> 00:32.641
What's so bad
you can't even tell me?

00:32.728 --> 00:34.034
So tell me about Dan.

00:34.121 --> 00:36.297
Dan, of all people
cannot know Georgie.

00:36.384 --> 00:38.690
- Um, I'm Sarah.
- Nice to meet you, Sarah.

00:41.563 --> 00:42.825
[indistinct whispering]

00:42.912 --> 00:44.261
[Gossip Girl]
And who am I?

00:44.348 --> 00:45.436
That's a secret
I'll never tell.

00:46.959 --> 00:48.613
You know you love me.

00:48.700 --> 00:51.573
XOXO, Gossip Girl.

00:54.402 --> 00:57.666
Spotted, Jenny Humphrey
wading in the Met fountain

00:57.753 --> 00:59.711
fishing for change.

00:59.798 --> 01:02.584
Blair Waldorf, seen dallying
with an off-duty doorman

01:02.671 --> 01:05.152
at the Blarney Stone
on a Monday night.

01:05.239 --> 01:07.067
[instrumental music]

01:08.242 --> 01:09.591
It looks like the battle

01:09.678 --> 01:11.593
between the Queen B
and Little J

01:11.680 --> 01:14.422
has moved from
the streets to the blogs.

01:14.509 --> 01:17.338
Who's sending
this debasing dish?

01:17.425 --> 01:18.991
I have a feeling..

01:20.950 --> 01:22.952
A nice, shiny dime
to add to your collection.

01:23.039 --> 01:26.912
[chuckles]
Why the fruit cup, B?
Lost your taste for yogurt?

01:26.999 --> 01:28.523
[laughing]

01:30.699 --> 01:31.961
So what are we doing tonight?

01:32.048 --> 01:34.137
Asher's parents
are in Cannes, so..

01:34.224 --> 01:35.834
...he and Jenny are
throwing a party at his house.

01:35.921 --> 01:39.099
It's a really small get together
with just our closest friends.

01:39.186 --> 01:41.188
- Sorry, Blair.
- Blair can take my place.

01:41.275 --> 01:43.320
Invitations
are non-transferable.

01:43.407 --> 01:44.756
She's new to the group.

01:44.843 --> 01:46.497
Just because your
name is on the invite

01:46.584 --> 01:48.151
doesn't make you a hostess.

01:48.238 --> 01:49.892
[cell phone rings]

01:49.979 --> 01:52.721
Oh, then why is
the party planner calling me?

01:52.808 --> 01:54.505
Excuse me, girls.

01:54.592 --> 01:56.594
Oh, my God.

01:56.681 --> 01:59.336
Hey, dad?
I'm kinda busy. What's up?

01:59.423 --> 02:01.991
I was just wondering what time
you want me to serve

02:02.078 --> 02:03.427
your favorite
home-cooked meal tonight.

02:03.514 --> 02:04.559
Maybe around 8?

02:04.646 --> 02:06.343
Oh, um,
I have that choir thing.

02:06.430 --> 02:07.736
Remember,
I talked to you about it

02:07.823 --> 02:08.780
and you said I could go
'cause I've been good?

02:08.867 --> 02:10.826
Oh, right, well..

02:10.913 --> 02:13.176
...maybe we could wait to eat
till after you got home then.

02:13.263 --> 02:14.786
'You're gonna be hungry
after all that singing.'

02:14.873 --> 02:16.397
Yeah, well, I mean,
they have food there

02:16.484 --> 02:17.789
and it's probably
gonna go pretty late.

02:17.876 --> 02:20.357
So, um, tomorrow?
Okay, love you.

02:23.012 --> 02:25.145
I love you too.

02:25.232 --> 02:27.321
Sorry. Floral emergency.

02:27.408 --> 02:28.887
Oh, and you
will be happy to know

02:28.974 --> 02:31.542
that the entire
Unity Lacrosse team RSVP'd.

02:35.764 --> 02:38.723
- 'Oh, my God. It's Asher.'
- 'Let's go say hi.'

02:38.810 --> 02:41.639
How did little Jenny Humphrey
become the next Brooke Astor?

02:41.726 --> 02:44.033
- The same way they all do.
- Marry up.

02:46.383 --> 02:47.471
[laughing]

02:49.517 --> 02:51.214
[Serena]
Hey, why the long face?

02:51.301 --> 02:52.476
Are you still sad
mom wouldn't let you go

02:52.563 --> 02:53.956
to Monte Carlo
for the bachelor party?

02:54.043 --> 02:55.479
No, I'm fine, I figured

02:55.566 --> 02:57.394
I'd let Bart,
Chuck and Prince Albert

02:57.481 --> 02:59.527
have their fun, oh, that
didn't come out like I meant it.

02:59.614 --> 03:00.876
[laughs]

03:00.963 --> 03:03.487
Um.. "Gossip Girl."

03:03.574 --> 03:05.446
Looks like
Jenny's been spotted at a gap

03:05.533 --> 03:07.491
sewing Stella McCartney
labels into pocket Ts.

03:07.578 --> 03:09.450
These rumors
are getting to be ridiculous.

03:09.537 --> 03:10.973
Oh, like the one
where I'mGossip Girl.

03:11.060 --> 03:12.801
Hey, it made sense
at the time.

03:12.888 --> 03:13.932
- It never made any sense.
- You have to admit.

03:14.019 --> 03:15.804
It did. Yeah, it did.

03:15.891 --> 03:17.240
Wait, hold on. It's Chuck.

03:17.327 --> 03:18.502
I-I have something to do
before school starts

03:18.589 --> 03:19.938
but tell him I say hi.

03:20.025 --> 03:21.288
Okay. Don't forget
about dinner tonight.

03:21.375 --> 03:23.028
- Yeah.
- Salut,Chuck.

03:23.115 --> 03:25.248
Yes, I'm still fine.

03:25.335 --> 03:26.989
I haven't heard
from Georgina in two weeks.

03:27.076 --> 03:28.991
So if you'd stop calling me
I'd finally be rid

03:29.078 --> 03:32.081
of all of my monsters. Bye.

03:34.039 --> 03:36.128
You can read about it
all day long

03:36.216 --> 03:38.305
but you have to walk
the city to know it.

03:38.392 --> 03:39.784
Okay, but look,
anything is better

03:39.871 --> 03:41.656
than getting lost
on the train every day.

03:41.743 --> 03:43.353
Subway. Click those heels
all you want.

03:43.440 --> 03:44.876
You're not in Portland anymore.

03:44.963 --> 03:48.097
Seriously, you and Dan
are so sweet to adopt me.

03:48.184 --> 03:50.186
I-I'd be a mess
without you guys.

03:50.273 --> 03:53.102
Well, more of a mess
than I already am.

03:53.189 --> 03:55.322
- Red eye to go?
- Yes, please. Thank you.

03:55.409 --> 03:56.845
Hey, Sarah,
sorry for talking

03:56.932 --> 03:58.325
your ear off
the other night, guys.

03:58.412 --> 03:59.804
He tends to ramble
as you'll get to know.

03:59.891 --> 04:01.980
- Yeah.
- Well, I'm a good listener.

04:02.067 --> 04:03.765
As he'll get to know.

04:03.852 --> 04:05.288
Are there
any new developments?

04:05.375 --> 04:07.290
Uh, no.
No, more of the same.

04:07.377 --> 04:09.205
Jenny and her boyfriend
are still inseparable

04:09.292 --> 04:11.120
and she's
even more insufferable.

04:11.207 --> 04:14.123
Give her a break.
Asher's her first love.

04:14.210 --> 04:15.820
It's infatuation.
It's not love.

04:15.907 --> 04:17.387
Yeah, but to a 15-year-old girl

04:17.474 --> 04:19.650
I mean, there really
isn't a difference.

04:19.737 --> 04:21.478
And how long
did it take you, Dan?

04:21.565 --> 04:24.438
Um...that's a little different,
Vanessa. It took me--

04:24.525 --> 04:26.657
Uh, one glance at
a ninth-grade birthday party?

04:26.744 --> 04:28.746
Yes, but two years
to obsess over it.

04:28.833 --> 04:30.835
So things are
better with...Serena?

04:30.922 --> 04:32.446
Serena. Yeah.
Yeah, good memory.

04:32.533 --> 04:34.448
Things are finally
back to normal.

04:34.535 --> 04:37.451
Good, well, I mean..

04:37.538 --> 04:39.757
...you know, it's-it's tough
making friends in a new city.

04:39.844 --> 04:41.716
It'd be really nice
to meet her.

04:41.803 --> 04:43.935
Yeah, Serena would love you.
She loves everybody.

04:44.022 --> 04:45.285
Not that she would only like you

04:45.372 --> 04:46.547
because she doesn't
discriminate.

04:46.634 --> 04:48.070
Um...ahem.

04:48.157 --> 04:50.638
See what she meant
about that rambling thing?

04:50.725 --> 04:53.641
- How's tonight?
- Tonight would be perfect.

04:53.728 --> 04:55.207
Good. See you.

04:57.340 --> 04:59.255
[indistinct chatter]

05:07.785 --> 05:10.135
[laughing]

05:10.222 --> 05:12.660
- He's so cute.
- Oh, my God..

05:12.747 --> 05:14.183
Hey, can I talk
to you for a minute?

05:14.270 --> 05:15.880
Sure. Is something wrong?

05:15.967 --> 05:18.100
That's what I was gonna ask you.
Where have you been lately?

05:18.187 --> 05:19.536
You haven't returned
any of my calls.

05:19.623 --> 05:21.408
[stammers]
Sorry.

05:21.495 --> 05:23.323
It's been harder than I thought
to keep up with schoolwork

05:23.410 --> 05:24.846
and the new
spring social calendar

05:24.933 --> 05:26.151
andmy new boyfriend.

05:26.238 --> 05:28.023
- Yeah. Asher, right?
- Yeah.

05:28.110 --> 05:30.852
He's cute and smart
and basically perfect.

05:30.939 --> 05:32.854
And the best part is
I think he reallylikes me.

05:32.941 --> 05:34.290
Well, then he has good taste.

05:34.377 --> 05:36.640
But...how well
do you actually know him?

05:36.727 --> 05:38.555
Oh, that's so sweet.
You're being protective.

05:38.642 --> 05:40.862
No, I'm not.
But, yes. Yes, I am.

05:40.949 --> 05:42.472
I've got nothing
against him, I just

05:42.559 --> 05:43.865
something about him
makes me feel maybe

05:43.952 --> 05:45.257
he's not the right guy for you.

05:45.345 --> 05:46.998
Oh, my God. Wait.

05:47.085 --> 05:48.478
Do you have a crush on me
or something?

05:48.565 --> 05:49.697
No, I don't,
I just want you--

05:49.784 --> 05:51.525
Don't be embarrassed.
Oh, it's cute.

05:51.612 --> 05:54.092
I mean, and not so unexpected,
actually. I'm flattered.

05:54.179 --> 05:56.486
It's just...
my heart belongs to Asher.

05:58.358 --> 06:00.664
I actually gotta go,
but, um, text me, 'kay?

06:00.751 --> 06:01.970
Bye.

06:02.057 --> 06:03.928
[instrumental music]

06:07.758 --> 06:09.543
[indistinct chatter]

06:14.591 --> 06:16.463
What, you're here.

06:16.550 --> 06:18.029
- Mmm. And you're late.
- Mm, I know.

06:18.116 --> 06:20.162
I come bearing apologies
and an invitation.

06:20.249 --> 06:21.642
What are you up to tonight?

06:21.729 --> 06:24.079
I know what
I'm notup to, having fun.

06:24.166 --> 06:26.473
The SAT tutor was over
for four hours last night.

06:26.560 --> 06:28.953
Hmm. So this tutor, is he..
Is he cute?

06:29.040 --> 06:31.303
Mm, well, if hair
in the ears is your thing.

06:31.391 --> 06:32.566
[laughs]

06:32.653 --> 06:33.871
I hate that since
I'm not gonna

06:33.958 --> 06:35.177
use the score
Chuck bought for me

06:35.264 --> 06:36.613
I have to study every night.

06:36.700 --> 06:38.920
I can't even
be distracted by that..

06:39.007 --> 06:40.965
- Mmm. That.
- Mmm.

06:41.052 --> 06:43.054
[laughing]

06:43.141 --> 06:45.927
I see your point,
so then how about, um..

06:46.014 --> 06:47.102
dinner tonight
with Sarah instead?

06:47.189 --> 06:48.669
Oh, Sarah again?

06:48.756 --> 06:50.105
What is she, your new girlfriend
or something?

06:50.192 --> 06:51.759
Yeah. Just kidding.

06:51.846 --> 06:53.413
But she's new in town,
and she does wanna meet you.

06:53.500 --> 06:55.371
Well, since Bart and Chuck
are out of town

06:55.458 --> 06:57.939
I already agreed to a quiet
family dinner in our old suite.

06:58.026 --> 07:00.202
I'm sorry.
What about tomorrow?

07:00.289 --> 07:02.291
No, my-my sister and tongue.

07:02.378 --> 07:03.988
The two things that don't
go together so well.

07:04.075 --> 07:06.034
[laughs]
Lighten up.

07:06.121 --> 07:07.818
You have been down on him
since the beginning.

07:07.905 --> 07:09.690
Give him a chance
and then judge.

07:09.777 --> 07:12.606
Maybe he'll surprise you,
like I did.

07:12.693 --> 07:14.172
How are you always so right?

07:14.259 --> 07:16.131
It's easy
when you're always wrong.

07:16.218 --> 07:17.872
Hey, you got
your first period free.

07:17.959 --> 07:19.700
Why don't you go
get to know him? Go.

07:19.787 --> 07:21.179
- Okay. Alright, okay.
- Love you.

07:22.616 --> 07:24.052
[cell phone beeps]

07:24.139 --> 07:26.054
[dramatic music]

07:32.321 --> 07:34.105
[Gossip Girl]
Sometimes in
an effort to spread

07:34.192 --> 07:36.151
the most outrageous rumors

07:36.238 --> 07:39.284
we look over the very thing
that's even more scandalous.

07:41.678 --> 07:43.288
The truth.

07:48.816 --> 07:51.340
And the only thing
more shocking than the truth

07:51.427 --> 07:54.474
are the lies people tell
to cover it up.

08:07.748 --> 08:09.184
[instrumental music]

08:12.100 --> 08:13.710
When you revise
the seating chart

08:13.797 --> 08:15.886
don't forget
to place Mr. Spitzer

08:15.973 --> 08:18.323
as far away
from Serena's table

08:18.410 --> 08:19.499
as possible.

08:19.586 --> 08:21.239
Thank you.

08:21.326 --> 08:23.328
Ugh. What is not
on the schedule today?

08:23.415 --> 08:25.200
I don't think I am.

08:25.287 --> 08:27.507
[instrumental music]

08:27.594 --> 08:29.334
Maybe you could
fit me in between

08:29.421 --> 08:31.249
Preston Bailey
and Sylvia Weinstock?

08:31.336 --> 08:33.600
Well, good luck fitting
anything between those two.

08:33.687 --> 08:35.036
What-what are you doing here?

08:35.123 --> 08:36.603
Well, believe it or not,
I'm here to see you.

08:36.690 --> 08:39.040
Well, I have a laundry list
of things to do today.

08:39.127 --> 08:40.650
It's about Jenny.

08:40.737 --> 08:42.260
Alison's away
on an artists' retreat

08:42.347 --> 08:43.740
and I could really use
a mother's advice.

08:43.827 --> 08:46.743
I think I might be
in over my head.

08:46.830 --> 08:48.702
I suppose we could
talk about it on the way.

08:52.706 --> 08:54.011
Thank you.

08:59.887 --> 09:01.366
What's going on?

09:01.453 --> 09:03.281
Hey, Asher. How's it going?
You got a minute?

09:03.368 --> 09:06.763
Yeah. Uh, but just a minute.
Jenny and I have a lunch date.

09:06.850 --> 09:09.070
Well, look, there's no easy
way to say this, honestly

09:09.157 --> 09:11.333
so I'm just gonna..
I'm just gonna say it.

09:11.420 --> 09:14.336
I-I, uh, saw you
this morning.

09:14.423 --> 09:16.860
- Saw me what?
- I saw you.

09:16.947 --> 09:18.383
You know,
I saw you kissing that guy.

09:18.470 --> 09:19.907
You got the wrong person.

09:19.994 --> 09:21.735
Come on, man.
I-I don't think I do.

09:21.822 --> 09:23.084
Are you calling me queer?

09:23.171 --> 09:25.042
That's...not at all
what I said.

09:25.129 --> 09:27.567
You wanna know
how queer I am?

09:27.654 --> 09:31.571
I'm soqueer, I'm gonna pop
your sister's cherry tonight.

09:31.658 --> 09:34.530
- Hey! What'd you say?
- What are you doing? Stop it!

09:34.617 --> 09:35.923
Jenny, I need
to talk to you in private.

09:36.010 --> 09:37.402
Well, anything you have
to say to me you can say

09:37.489 --> 09:38.839
in front of my boyfriend.

09:38.926 --> 09:40.492
Re.. Okay. Alright, fine.

09:40.580 --> 09:42.190
Your boyfriend is not
being honest with you.

09:42.277 --> 09:45.802
I wasn't gonna
tell you yet, but I..

09:45.889 --> 09:49.066
...wanted to invite you to
the country house this weekend.

09:49.153 --> 09:51.808
Your brother thought we were
moving too fast and got upset.

09:51.895 --> 09:53.636
Dan, can't you just
let me be happy for once?

09:53.723 --> 09:55.246
Jenny, I want you to be happy,
just not with a guy--

09:55.333 --> 09:57.379
Yeah, I understand
that you're threatened by him

09:57.466 --> 09:59.294
because clearly
he's everything you wanna be.

09:59.381 --> 10:03.298
He's good-looking and worldly,
a legacy at Dartmouth.

10:03.385 --> 10:04.516
But even you should
know that jealousy

10:04.604 --> 10:06.475
clashes with LL Bean pants.

10:06.562 --> 10:08.477
[dramatic music]

10:13.438 --> 10:15.223
It's a snub
from oneparty, B.

10:15.310 --> 10:17.573
Plus what's the big deal anyway?
You don't even like Asher.

10:17.660 --> 10:19.270
I didn't like last season's
Louis Vuitton

10:19.357 --> 10:21.011
patchwork bag either,
but that doesn't mean

10:21.098 --> 10:22.970
I want to see it all over town
on Jenny Humphrey's arm.

10:23.057 --> 10:24.667
Touche.

10:24.754 --> 10:26.364
What do you say we have
a girls' night out tonight?

10:26.451 --> 10:28.453
Oh, I'm sorry. I can't.
I have dinner with the family.

10:28.540 --> 10:31.152
Let me remind you
of a little promise you made.

10:31.239 --> 10:33.067
"Don't go to France.
I'll be there for you."

10:33.154 --> 10:34.677
I'm really sorry
I've been distant

10:34.764 --> 10:36.200
but things will
be better soon, I promise.

10:36.287 --> 10:37.593
Obviously starting tomorrow.

10:37.680 --> 10:40.030
- Hey.
- Hey.

10:40.117 --> 10:42.467
What's wrong?
You look stressed, even for you.

10:42.554 --> 10:44.252
I'm still worried
about Jenny.

10:44.339 --> 10:45.557
You mean because
she's self-obsessed

10:45.645 --> 10:47.342
self-serving,
self-centered, self--

10:47.429 --> 10:49.779
No, no, I wish it was
about her and herself

10:49.866 --> 10:52.303
but it's more about
who she's with.

10:52.390 --> 10:55.306
I can't get through to her,
I tried

10:55.393 --> 10:59.093
and she just completely blew me
off and she dissed my pants.

10:59.180 --> 11:00.747
Maybe I underestimated her.

11:00.834 --> 11:03.227
She's just going through
a phase. We all went through it.

11:03.314 --> 11:05.926
And apparently,
some of us stillare in it.

11:06.013 --> 11:08.102
All that matters
to someone like Jenny right now

11:08.189 --> 11:10.974
are the four G's. Guys,
girlfriends and Gossip Girl.

11:11.061 --> 11:12.367
It's true. Don't feel bad.

11:12.454 --> 11:13.890
'Unless it's coming
from one of them'

11:13.977 --> 11:15.631
she's not gonna hear it.

11:17.807 --> 11:19.679
[instrumental music]

11:24.684 --> 11:26.294
- Here we go.
- Ah, thank you.

11:26.381 --> 11:29.340
I tell her she can't
see Asher. She calls him.

11:29.427 --> 11:32.735
I take away her phone.
They're on iChat.

11:32.822 --> 11:34.215
How do you keep them
from growing up

11:34.302 --> 11:35.999
when they can have
a full relationship

11:36.086 --> 11:37.609
from the confines
of their own bedrooms?

11:37.697 --> 11:39.742
Well, the answer
is you can't.

11:39.829 --> 11:41.962
She's gonna grow up
no matter what.

11:42.049 --> 11:44.442
I read her email.

11:44.529 --> 11:46.706
Well, you can't be too concerned
about their privacy

11:46.793 --> 11:48.708
when their well-being
is at stake.

11:48.795 --> 11:50.971
Especially if you think
they're lying to you.

11:51.058 --> 11:52.886
- Was she?
- Right to my face.

11:52.973 --> 11:54.975
I know Serena went through
a similar phase.

11:55.062 --> 11:58.195
Well, if Serena's indiscretions
were as PG as Jenny's

11:58.282 --> 12:00.328
I wouldn't have
needed the Botox.

12:00.415 --> 12:02.025
Dan was so much easier.

12:02.112 --> 12:03.723
Well, raising girls
is different.

12:03.810 --> 12:06.247
Serena would be a horrible
monster for a hundred days

12:06.334 --> 12:08.684
and then on the 101st

12:08.771 --> 12:10.468
she'd be
my little girl again.

12:12.296 --> 12:13.558
So I just wait and hope, huh?

12:13.645 --> 12:15.299
Well, that's the hardest part.

12:15.386 --> 12:17.519
You have to trust
that you've done your job.

12:18.955 --> 12:20.522
She'll come back to you.

12:24.526 --> 12:26.615
[gasps]
That's..

12:26.702 --> 12:27.877
- It's perfect.
- Beautiful.

12:27.964 --> 12:29.705
- It's my finest piece.
- Mm-hmm.

12:32.229 --> 12:33.448
Here.

12:35.319 --> 12:36.756
Let me.

12:40.150 --> 12:42.152
Mark Ingram, it's beautiful.

12:42.239 --> 12:43.719
You've outdone yourself.

12:43.806 --> 12:45.286
Oh, wow.

12:45.373 --> 12:47.244
[Gossip Girl]
This just in.

12:47.331 --> 12:50.595
Asher Hornsby spotted
locking lips before class

12:50.682 --> 12:52.336
but not with his girlfriend.

12:52.423 --> 12:55.165
Looks like gentlemen
don't prefer blondes, Little J.

12:55.252 --> 12:57.559
They prefer other gentlemen.

12:57.646 --> 12:59.604
Now you know
how Vanessa Hudgens feels.

12:59.691 --> 13:01.476
Is this just
another round of blanks

13:01.563 --> 13:03.304
fired between B and Little J?

13:03.391 --> 13:05.785
I'm tired of being
the bearer of bad grudges.

13:05.872 --> 13:08.439
This is the last item that goes
to press without proof.

13:08.526 --> 13:10.702
I'm so glad Gossip Girl
finally got her balls back.

13:10.790 --> 13:13.009
Yeah, she was totally turning
into the new page six.

13:13.096 --> 13:15.142
[instrumental music]

13:15.229 --> 13:17.535
- Low blow.
- Wasn't me. Wish it was.

13:19.711 --> 13:21.061
[cell phone rings]

13:21.148 --> 13:22.540
- Hello?
- 'Miss van derWoodsen?'

13:22.627 --> 13:24.020
'It's Luke
from the concierge's desk.'

13:24.107 --> 13:25.413
'You asked that we call first'

13:25.500 --> 13:26.675
'before delivering
anything upstairs?'

13:26.762 --> 13:28.285
Is there something for me?

13:28.372 --> 13:30.897
'Yes, a package
from a Miss Georgina Sparks.'

13:30.984 --> 13:33.464
[dramatic music]

13:33.551 --> 13:35.162
'Hello? Did I lose you?'

13:35.249 --> 13:38.339
Uh, no.
Uh, just keep it there.

13:38.426 --> 13:39.862
I'll pick it up
right after school.

13:39.949 --> 13:41.255
And don't let it
out of your sight.

13:41.342 --> 13:43.387
- 'Of course.'
- Thank you.

13:43.474 --> 13:45.172
- What was that about?
- Nothing.

13:45.259 --> 13:47.565
It's just this.. Nothing.

13:47.652 --> 13:48.915
I'll see you later,
okay? Bye.

13:49.002 --> 13:52.048
- Bye. Hey.
- Hey, B.

13:52.135 --> 13:55.182
Dan Humphrey, just who I hate
to admit I was looking for.

13:55.269 --> 13:56.531
You're dirty.

13:56.618 --> 13:57.967
Wha.. Uh, what are you
talking about?

13:58.054 --> 14:00.274
Cheating, drinking, drugs.
It's all fair game.

14:00.361 --> 14:02.537
But outing
your sister's boyfriend is dark.

14:02.624 --> 14:04.408
How did squeaky-clean Humphrey
even come up with that?

14:04.495 --> 14:06.802
[sighs]
I didn't
come up with anything.

14:06.889 --> 14:09.892
Oh, my God. You know something.
Spill it.

14:09.979 --> 14:12.329
Yeah, I-I might have seen
Asher kissing another guy.

14:12.416 --> 14:14.418
So it's true?
Who was he kissing?

14:14.505 --> 14:15.942
I don't know. I don't,
I don't know. I couldn't see.

14:16.029 --> 14:17.160
But what does
that even matter?

14:17.247 --> 14:18.901
Right now
Gossip Girl's credibility is

14:18.988 --> 14:21.077
the same as Tinsely Mortimer's
after a few martinis.

14:21.164 --> 14:22.818
But if I can prove
that his duplicity

14:22.905 --> 14:25.081
is more than just a rumor,
then they'll break up.

14:25.168 --> 14:26.300
That's what you want,
isn't it?

14:26.387 --> 14:27.823
Well, yeah, I guess.

14:27.910 --> 14:29.912
Asher's just
using your sister as a cover.

14:29.999 --> 14:31.783
It's your brotherly duty
to save her

14:31.871 --> 14:33.350
from becoming
the next Katie Holmes.

14:33.437 --> 14:34.830
And you're in this
to help Jenny?

14:34.917 --> 14:36.005
Motive is irrelevant

14:36.092 --> 14:37.485
as long as
our endgame is the same.

14:37.572 --> 14:39.574
No, Blair,
this is not a game to me, okay?

14:39.661 --> 14:40.967
I don't want her to get hurt.

14:41.054 --> 14:42.664
Well, you should've
thought that through

14:42.751 --> 14:44.622
before you told all of Manhattan
that Jenny's a glorified hag.

14:46.537 --> 14:49.105
You know what?
I.. You're on your own.

14:49.192 --> 14:51.673
- I'm done.
- Suit yourself.

14:58.549 --> 14:59.899

Really, Rufus.
What were you thinking?

14:59.986 --> 15:01.944
'You threw her
a surprise birthday party'

15:02.031 --> 15:04.860
'and had her face painted
on a cake with a tiara?'

15:04.947 --> 15:06.906
It seemed like
a good idea at the time.

15:06.993 --> 15:09.125
'Yeah, well, so did flannel
and acid-washed jeans'

15:09.212 --> 15:11.867
'but they weren't
flattering either.'

15:20.702 --> 15:22.138
Is it too much?

15:25.098 --> 15:28.057
Uh, is it not enough?

15:28.144 --> 15:30.059
It's not the dress.
It's you in it.

15:32.757 --> 15:33.976
Hmm.

I'm sorry, I thought..

15:43.159 --> 15:44.595

15:55.128 --> 15:57.347
No, we arefriends.

It's just how you look.

[instrumental music]

16:06.835 --> 16:09.055
Nothing new on
"Gossip Girl" for three hours.

16:09.142 --> 16:11.100
Guess she wasn't kidding
about her new standards.

16:11.187 --> 16:12.623
Hey, Jenny!
Sorry, I can't chat.

16:12.710 --> 16:14.408
But have so much fun
at your party tonight.

16:14.495 --> 16:17.541
She's totallyrunning to
a booty call with your brother.

16:17.628 --> 16:19.195
I cannot believe
you just went there.

16:19.282 --> 16:20.849
And where have
yougone, Little J?

16:20.936 --> 16:22.111
Yeah, you and Asher.

16:22.198 --> 16:24.026
- How far?
- Far enough.

16:24.113 --> 16:25.593
Playing coy
only means one thing.

16:25.680 --> 16:27.334
Maybe Asher doesn'tlike girls.

16:27.421 --> 16:28.596
Is that why
we went to third?

16:28.683 --> 16:29.858
You went to third?

16:29.945 --> 16:32.382
No, hedid.

16:32.469 --> 16:35.124
Well done.
Make him work for it.

16:37.300 --> 16:39.302
Whoever said that money
doesn't buy happiness

16:39.389 --> 16:41.000
didn't know where to shop.

16:41.087 --> 16:43.524
Lucky for me, I may have
to go out tonight after all.

16:43.611 --> 16:44.960
- Did you get it?
- Yeah.

16:45.047 --> 16:46.875
Lucky for you, is knows
five ways to sneak into

16:46.962 --> 16:50.357
the Unity boys' locker room,
and six to sneak out.

16:50.444 --> 16:53.012
Asher takes an abnormally
long shower after practice.

16:53.099 --> 16:54.709
Maybe his lacrosse stick
isn't the only thing

16:54.796 --> 16:56.363
he likes to play with.

16:56.450 --> 16:57.886
Why'd you want
his phone so badly anyway?

16:57.973 --> 16:59.279
It was once said
that a person's eyes

16:59.366 --> 17:01.194
are the windows to their soul.

That was before
people had cell phones.

for a couple hours.

17:23.955 --> 17:26.828
Yeah, well, a lot can
happen in a couple hours.

Hmm.. Uh..

17:31.311 --> 17:32.877
Uh, Jenny.

17:32.964 --> 17:35.184
- What are you doing?
- What's wrong?

It.. Nothing's wrong.

not happy?

my end of the bargain.

You're Jenny Humphrey
from Brooklyn.

You need status,
access, resources.

- Igive that to you.
- What do I give you?

to talk about this?

17:59.208 --> 18:02.733
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, we do.

you can do to show your thanks.

29:18.931 --> 29:20.584
But we're not friends.

29:20.671 --> 29:22.673
Oh, I think we are.

29:22.761 --> 29:24.632
[chuckles]

29:24.719 --> 29:27.026
You see, because
with me as your enemy

29:27.113 --> 29:28.592
Dan sees this.

29:28.679 --> 29:30.856
And if the heavy petting
doesn't send him running

29:30.943 --> 29:34.381
well, I'll bet
what happened after will.

29:34.468 --> 29:37.340
- Hey, what'd we miss?
- Nothing.

29:37.427 --> 29:39.603
It's like Sarah and I have
known each other for years.

29:39.690 --> 29:40.866
[chuckles]

29:40.953 --> 29:42.215
Oh. Great.

29:42.302 --> 29:45.218
We don't need the laptop
anymore. Thanks.

29:45.305 --> 29:47.394
No, I got a little shy
about showing it.

29:47.481 --> 29:49.483
- Maybe next time?
- Okay.

29:53.574 --> 29:55.706
[instrumental music]

29:59.623 --> 30:01.538
So was it as special
as you hoped it would be?

30:01.625 --> 30:05.194
- 'Cause yours totallywasn't.
- And yourswas?

30:05.281 --> 30:07.414
- 'Ladies, your drinks.'
- 'I mean, yeah.'

30:07.501 --> 30:08.937
Asher made me feel really safe.

30:09.024 --> 30:10.939
You are solucky.

30:11.026 --> 30:12.419
Hmm, I know.

30:12.506 --> 30:14.551
You guys, Blair is here.

30:14.638 --> 30:17.163
What is she doing here?
She wasn't invited.

30:17.250 --> 30:18.904
[indistinct chatter]

30:21.254 --> 30:22.777
We need to talk.

30:25.084 --> 30:26.955
Give us a moment, guys.

30:27.042 --> 30:28.435
I thought you might
want this back.

30:28.522 --> 30:31.046
Whatever you found

30:31.133 --> 30:32.613
it's not what it looks like.

30:32.700 --> 30:33.919
It's always
what it looks like.

30:34.006 --> 30:35.485
And judging by
the texts and photos

30:35.572 --> 30:37.313
it looks like a little more
than friendship.

30:37.400 --> 30:38.749
What are you
gonna do with them?

30:38.837 --> 30:40.708
Well, lucky for you
your friend

30:40.795 --> 30:42.666
'is someone
I actually care about'

30:42.753 --> 30:44.886
or I would've used them
against you and Jenny already.

30:44.973 --> 30:46.453
Too bad you don't
care about him the same way.

30:46.540 --> 30:49.282
It's okay, Blair.
I can handle this.

30:49.369 --> 30:51.719
- What's he doing here?
- What is she doing here?

30:51.806 --> 30:52.851
Are you gonna tell her, or am I?

30:52.938 --> 30:54.243
There's nothing to tell.

30:54.330 --> 30:55.897
Gossip Girl was right.

30:55.984 --> 30:58.769
Asher was kissing someone
this morning...me.

30:58.857 --> 31:00.859
[Asher]
'He's totally lying.
Tell him, Jenny.'

31:00.946 --> 31:02.382
I was with you all morning.

31:02.469 --> 31:04.123
[murmuring]

31:05.733 --> 31:07.126
Yeah. Asher's right.

31:08.605 --> 31:10.999
I waswith him.
Eric's lying.

31:11.086 --> 31:14.263
Why would I stand here,
in front of everyone we know

31:14.350 --> 31:16.091
and tell them
if it wasn't true?

31:17.440 --> 31:20.835
I'm gay...and so are you.

31:20.922 --> 31:24.143
Get this faggot
out of here!

31:24.230 --> 31:26.232
Go ahead and do it.

31:26.319 --> 31:28.712
[intense music]

31:33.152 --> 31:35.197
What did you just do?

31:35.284 --> 31:36.503
You'll see.

31:47.166 --> 31:50.125
What kind of mother does not
know that her son is gay?

31:50.212 --> 31:51.648
The people you
know best are the ones

31:51.735 --> 31:53.563
most capable
of surprising you.

31:53.650 --> 31:57.219
The things that I said,
the way I acted..

31:57.306 --> 31:59.830
...it was not
my finest maternal moment.

31:59.918 --> 32:02.355
'What if he does
something again?'

32:02.442 --> 32:05.227
I know how much you love him.
So does he.

32:05.314 --> 32:06.707
You just need
to remind him of that.

32:06.794 --> 32:08.839
But what if it's not enough?

32:08.927 --> 32:10.711
Most of the time,
it's all we've got.

32:10.798 --> 32:14.410
And what about you?
What are you gonna do?

32:14.497 --> 32:17.500
I'm gonna wait
for my daughter to come to me.

32:17.587 --> 32:20.808
And then I'm gonna
ground her until she's 25.

32:20.895 --> 32:23.071
[both chuckle]

32:23.158 --> 32:25.987
Ahh, we make
quite the team, huh?

32:26.074 --> 32:27.206
Always did.

32:29.077 --> 32:31.384
Good luck, Lil,
with everything.

32:32.907 --> 32:35.301
I'm sure you'll make
a beautiful bride.

32:35.388 --> 32:37.346
Hmm, thank you.

32:39.435 --> 32:41.394
Goodnight, Rufus.

32:46.660 --> 32:48.575
[Gossip Girl]
Weekend update.

32:48.662 --> 32:51.534
A same-sex kiss hasn't caused
this much controversy

32:51.621 --> 32:53.449
since Britney and Madonna.

32:53.536 --> 32:56.278
Looks like Little J didn't
spread her legs after all.

32:56.365 --> 32:58.454
She spread lies instead.

32:58.541 --> 33:01.762
Asher is gay, and I have
the correspondence to prove it.

33:01.849 --> 33:04.765
Looks like someone needs
a semester in France.

33:04.852 --> 33:06.636
[Penelope]
'Get your things, girls.
We're leaving.'

33:06.723 --> 33:08.595
Wait, guys, we can still
have fun. Don't leave.

33:08.682 --> 33:10.945
It's kind of hard to party
after the gay bomb drops.

33:11.032 --> 33:13.252
I'm gonna do something
out of character

33:13.339 --> 33:15.167
and give you
the benefit of the doubt.

33:15.254 --> 33:16.777
Tell us Gossip Girl is wrong.

33:16.864 --> 33:19.823
Did you or did you not
sleep with Asher?

33:19.910 --> 33:22.261
I...may have exaggerated
a little bit.

33:22.348 --> 33:25.177
[scoffs]
Dating a gay guy
is an honest mistake

33:25.264 --> 33:29.007
but lying to your girlfriends
about sex is unforgivable.

33:29.094 --> 33:32.314
To think, I almost asked you to
wear a matching dress tonight.

33:32.401 --> 33:34.012
You're branded now
with the L word.

33:34.099 --> 33:36.144
Liar.

33:36.231 --> 33:38.364
So what are we doing tonight?

33:38.451 --> 33:40.235
Weare doing nothing.

33:40.322 --> 33:42.933
I, however, am going home.

33:43.021 --> 33:45.936
But, um...tomorrow,
dinner at the Waverly..

33:46.024 --> 33:48.504
- And then to 151 for drinks.
- Yeah.

33:48.591 --> 33:51.377
I'll have Dorota BlackBerry
everyone an itinerary.

33:51.464 --> 33:53.553
[Gossip Girl]
Don't look so sad, Little J.

33:53.640 --> 33:55.816
The sun will
come out tomorrow.

33:55.903 --> 33:57.992
Even though
your boyfriend did today.

33:59.254 --> 34:00.908
[instrumental music]

34:06.740 --> 34:07.958
[door shuts]

34:09.308 --> 34:12.224
Hey, um,
I made...uh, some tea.

34:12.311 --> 34:16.054
Um, it's probably
iced now, but, um..

34:16.141 --> 34:18.273
- Look, my reaction earlier--
- It's okay, mom.

34:18.360 --> 34:20.406
No, it's notokay.

34:22.016 --> 34:24.540
You just caught me off guard.
I guess I..

34:25.498 --> 34:26.847
I just wasn't ready.

34:26.934 --> 34:29.676
Well, I wasn't
ready either, so..

34:29.763 --> 34:31.069
It's okay if you need time.

34:32.896 --> 34:38.119
Well...since
you're being so honest

34:38.206 --> 34:41.601
I'm gonna, um,
try as well, okay?

34:45.518 --> 34:48.173
I'm scared.

34:48.260 --> 34:50.000
[sighs]

34:50.088 --> 34:52.873
And life is tough enough
as it is, you know?

34:52.960 --> 34:55.354
I want, I want the best for you.

34:56.659 --> 34:58.879
And, um..

34:58.966 --> 35:02.665
I'm worried for your safety
and your happiness.

35:02.752 --> 35:06.756
I have a better chance
of being happy if I'm honest.

35:06.843 --> 35:08.715
I know that

35:08.802 --> 35:11.196
and I want you to know
what love is

35:11.283 --> 35:13.676
whoever you're with

35:13.763 --> 35:16.418
because it's pretty great.

35:16.505 --> 35:19.465
You would know, right?
Fourth time's the charm.

35:19.552 --> 35:22.163
[chuckles]

35:22.250 --> 35:23.730
[Gossip Girl]
Ah, yes.

35:23.817 --> 35:25.471
The truth always comes out.

35:25.558 --> 35:28.038
It's one of
the fundamental rules of time.

35:28.126 --> 35:31.651
And when it comes out,
it can set you free..

35:31.738 --> 35:35.307
...or end everything
you fought so hard for.

35:37.396 --> 35:38.832
[elevator bell dings]

My, my. If it isn't Little J,
risen from the Ashes.

35:48.407 --> 35:52.150
I came to tell you
in person...you win.

35:52.237 --> 35:55.631
Oh, sweetie.
We just started to play.

35:55.718 --> 35:58.373
No, you don't understand.

35:58.460 --> 36:00.288
I'm done.

36:00.375 --> 36:04.249
With you, with them,
with all of it.

36:04.336 --> 36:07.252
Just like that,
you wave the white flag?

36:07.339 --> 36:09.950
I lied, and I stole

36:10.037 --> 36:12.996
and I lost the respect
of my family...for what?

36:13.083 --> 36:14.563
'So I can be like you?'

36:14.650 --> 36:16.957
You asked me before
if it was all worth it.

36:19.046 --> 36:20.874
My answer is, it's not.

36:22.092 --> 36:24.007
I tried to warn you.

36:26.009 --> 36:27.141
There's a price to pay.

36:30.449 --> 36:32.581
I always knew a girl like you
couldn't afford it.

36:32.668 --> 36:35.323
Well, you were right.

36:35.410 --> 36:39.458
Well, you put up
a good fight...for a freshman.

36:39.545 --> 36:40.720
Thanks.

36:42.678 --> 36:44.202
I hope you don't expect a hug.

36:46.595 --> 36:48.815
I don't expect anything anymore.

36:51.209 --> 36:53.602
[music continues]

36:58.216 --> 37:00.522
So, she's great, right?
What do you think?

37:00.609 --> 37:03.090
Honestly, there's something
I don't really like about her.

37:03.177 --> 37:04.918
Okay, but you had your doubts
about Vanessa in the beginning

37:05.005 --> 37:06.528
and now you guys are friends.

37:06.615 --> 37:08.182
This is different.

37:09.879 --> 37:12.708
[sighs]
I-I don't understand
why you-you're--

37:12.795 --> 37:13.927
- Why I'm what?
- Jealous.

37:14.014 --> 37:15.537
There's no reason to be.

37:15.624 --> 37:17.757
She-she actually wanted us
to patch things up.

37:17.844 --> 37:19.280
What, you told her
about our problems?

37:19.367 --> 37:21.021
Yes, because she wanted
to listen to them

37:21.108 --> 37:22.544
and she had good advice, too.

37:22.631 --> 37:24.503
Look at me.

37:24.590 --> 37:27.157
I love you, okay?

37:27.245 --> 37:29.551
You just have
to take my word for it.

37:29.638 --> 37:31.379
Do not trust her.

37:31.466 --> 37:34.295
But you just met her, I..

37:34.382 --> 37:35.644
You know, you've been
hanging out with Chuck

37:35.731 --> 37:37.080
and you've been partying

37:37.167 --> 37:39.474
and avoiding me,
and-and lying.

37:39.561 --> 37:41.911
And y-you're trying to tell me
who I can and cannot trust?

37:41.998 --> 37:44.174
I-I don't understand
that at all.

37:48.091 --> 37:51.965
You know we-we all live
in Brooklyn, so..

37:52.052 --> 37:54.489
I don't know,
if-if you need to catch a cab

37:54.576 --> 37:55.708
I think you should do that here.

37:55.795 --> 37:57.971
Dan, don't. I want to talk.

37:58.058 --> 37:59.277
Then talk.

'I'm gonna get going.'

38:04.282 --> 38:07.023
Hey, just hold on.
One-one second.

I forgot something inside.
I'll catch up with you guys?

Okay.

38:17.382 --> 38:20.689
Hmm. Well, I had fun.

38:20.776 --> 38:22.691
- How about you?
- What do you want from me?

38:22.778 --> 38:25.607
I want things to go back to
how they were before that night

38:25.694 --> 38:27.740
before things
got so screwed up.

38:27.827 --> 38:31.178
We were such good friends,
and now we canbe again.

38:31.265 --> 38:34.137
Why would I want to be friends
with somebody who blackmails me

38:34.224 --> 38:37.576
who outs my little brother
at the dinner table?

38:37.663 --> 38:39.404
Eric was an honest mistake.

38:39.491 --> 38:41.275
- I would never hurt him.
- No, I don't believe you.

38:41.362 --> 38:43.538
I don't believe you
about Eric, about anything.

38:45.018 --> 38:47.194
Maybe you're right.

38:47.281 --> 38:49.196
Maybe I did it on purpose.

38:49.283 --> 38:52.895
[scoffs]
Because I can,
because I know things

38:52.982 --> 38:55.071
about you,
about your family

38:55.158 --> 38:57.422
about your boyfriend.

38:57.509 --> 38:59.032
And I know them
before you do.

39:01.774 --> 39:03.732
Oh, look. Cab.

Hold up, guys.
I'm coming.

39:23.143 --> 39:24.884
[Gossip Girl]
Another way
the truth comes out

39:24.971 --> 39:28.148
when you don't even
mean it to.

39:28.235 --> 39:30.106
"Angry."

39:30.193 --> 39:32.021
"Change."

39:32.108 --> 39:34.284
"Trust."

39:34.372 --> 39:35.808
"Girl."

39:35.895 --> 39:37.679
Somethin' you wanna talk about?

39:37.766 --> 39:39.812
Who would have thought scrabble
could be so therapeutic?

39:39.899 --> 39:42.380
That last one was
a triple word score.

39:45.948 --> 39:48.908
[Gossip Girl]
Or when, without saying a word

39:48.995 --> 39:50.997
it's still loud and clear.

39:51.084 --> 39:53.434
[instrumental music]

40:03.009 --> 40:04.532
Dad?

40:06.534 --> 40:08.797
Do you think
it'd be okay if I joined you?

40:14.063 --> 40:16.370
You know there's always
room for you here.

40:24.857 --> 40:28.643
Yeah, and dad's totally losing,
so he could use your help.

40:28.730 --> 40:31.820
[sniffles]
Dad, I'm sorry.

40:31.907 --> 40:33.387
[sniffles]

40:33.474 --> 40:35.215
I'm sorry about everything.

40:37.173 --> 40:38.871
[sobbing]

40:42.657 --> 40:44.746
[Gossip Girl]
But the worst thing
the truth can do

40:44.833 --> 40:46.618
is when you finally tell it

40:46.705 --> 40:50.099
it doesn't set you free,
but locks you away forever.

40:50.186 --> 40:51.884
Blair?

40:51.971 --> 40:54.974
Serena, what are you
doing here? It's late.

40:55.061 --> 40:56.715
Oh, my God.

40:56.802 --> 40:58.978
What happened? What's wrong?

40:59.065 --> 41:00.632
- Talk to me.
- I can't.

41:00.719 --> 41:02.285
Of course you can.

41:02.372 --> 41:05.941
No. No, B, this is
the one thing I can't tell you.

41:06.028 --> 41:07.987
- I can't tell anyone.
- I-I'm not anyone.

41:08.074 --> 41:10.685
I'm me. You can
tell me anything.

41:10.772 --> 41:13.166
No, I can't.

41:13.253 --> 41:15.516
Because then
that'd make you a part of it

41:15.603 --> 41:17.866
and you can't
be a part of this.

41:17.953 --> 41:20.782
What are you talking about?
You're starting to scare me.

41:20.869 --> 41:23.742
Hey, hey, hey.
We're sisters.

41:23.829 --> 41:26.266
You're my family.
What is you, is me.

41:26.353 --> 41:29.182
There's nothing that you could
ever say to make me let go.

41:33.186 --> 41:34.796
I love you.

41:36.058 --> 41:37.712
What is it?

41:39.714 --> 41:42.021
I killed someone.

41:42.108 --> 41:43.979

41:53.423 --> 41:55.991
