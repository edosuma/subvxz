WEBVTT

00:01.293 --> 00:04.796
It seems today
that all you see

00:04.880 --> 00:08.133
Is violence in movies
and sex on TV

00:08.217 --> 00:11.720
But where are those
good old-fashioned values

00:11.803 --> 00:15.015
On which we used to rely?

00:15.098 --> 00:18.227
Lucky there's a family guy

00:18.310 --> 00:21.355
Lucky there's a man who
positively can do

00:21.438 --> 00:23.106
All the things that make us

00:23.190 --> 00:24.900
Laugh and cry

00:24.983 --> 00:30.322
He's... a...
Fam... ily... Guy!

00:35.244 --> 00:37.496
Um, Mom, Dad, um,

00:37.579 --> 00:40.541
I decided I want a big party
this year with all my friends.

00:40.666 --> 00:41.959
And maybe a band.

00:42.042 --> 00:43.043
Is that cool?

00:43.126 --> 00:44.127
-Yeah, sure.
-Yeah.

00:44.211 --> 00:45.212
-Yeah, well, that's...
-Sure.

00:45.295 --> 00:46.338
-Yeah, why not?
-Why not? Sure.

00:46.421 --> 00:47.422
Oh, thanks, guys!

00:47.506 --> 00:48.674
You're the best!

00:49.174 --> 00:50.384
What's she talking about?

00:50.467 --> 00:51.552
A party for what?

00:51.635 --> 00:52.636
I don't know.

00:52.719 --> 00:53.762
She have her period
or something?

00:53.846 --> 00:54.847
She getting married?

00:54.930 --> 00:56.181
No. If she was
getting married,

00:56.265 --> 00:57.933
we probably would've
seen a guy around, right?

00:58.016 --> 00:59.101
Sound reasoning.

00:59.184 --> 01:02.145
You guys, it's Meg's
birthday next week.

01:02.229 --> 01:04.106
(gasps)
Oh, my God, it is!

01:04.189 --> 01:05.941
Peter, we got to
put together a party!

01:06.024 --> 01:08.402
Ah, man, I hate
kids' birthday parties.

01:08.485 --> 01:09.820
This is gonna be
worse than that time

01:09.903 --> 01:12.197
I was stuck behind Robert Loggia
at the airport.

01:12.281 --> 01:13.407
May I have
your name, please?

01:13.490 --> 01:15.117
Robert Loggia.

01:15.200 --> 01:16.243
Can you
spell that for me?

01:16.326 --> 01:19.037
Certainly. That's Robert Loggia.

01:19.121 --> 01:21.707
"R" as in Robert Loggia,

01:21.874 --> 01:25.419
"O" as in "Oh, my God,
it's Robert Loggia,"

01:25.502 --> 01:29.131
"B" as in "By God,
that's Robert Loggia,"

01:29.214 --> 01:33.135
"E" as in everybody
loves Robert Loggia,

01:33.218 --> 01:36.305
"R" as in Robert Loggia,

01:36.430 --> 01:40.225
"T" as in "Tim, look over there,
it's Robert Loggia,"

01:40.309 --> 01:41.560
space,

01:41.727 --> 01:44.521
"L" as in "Look!
It's Robert Loggia..."

01:44.646 --> 01:45.689
(sighs)

01:49.776 --> 01:50.777
Here you are, Brian.

01:50.861 --> 01:51.904
What's this?

01:51.987 --> 01:53.488
It's an invitation
to Meg's party.

01:53.572 --> 01:54.615
I'm the party planner.

01:54.698 --> 01:55.908
You have to RSVP.

01:55.991 --> 01:57.326
You can do it right now
if you want.

01:57.409 --> 01:58.911
All right, fine, I'll
come to Meg's party.

01:58.994 --> 02:01.246
No, you have to call
the RSVP line.

02:01.997 --> 02:03.040
You got to be
kidding me.

02:03.123 --> 02:04.208
I'm waiting.

02:04.291 --> 02:05.292
(sighs)

02:05.375 --> 02:07.836
Ring, ring.

02:08.212 --> 02:09.379
Aren't you gonna
pick it up?

02:09.463 --> 02:11.089
No, I'm not gonna pick it up
on the first few rings.

02:11.173 --> 02:13.550
I'm busy. Maybe I'm
in the other room.

02:13.759 --> 02:15.844
Ring, ring.

02:15.969 --> 02:17.804
Ring, ring...

02:18.639 --> 02:20.474
Ring, ring.

02:21.391 --> 02:22.684
Ring... Oh, come on!

02:22.768 --> 02:24.019
(high-pitched voice):
Hello! Stewie?

02:24.102 --> 02:26.104
No, this is Stewie's
housekeeper, Mrs. Pennyapple.

02:26.188 --> 02:27.189
I'll see if he's in.

02:27.272 --> 02:28.815
Stewie! Stewie!

02:28.899 --> 02:30.150
(normal voice):
Yes, Mrs. Pennyapple?

02:30.234 --> 02:31.401
You've got
a telephone call.

02:31.485 --> 02:32.569
Who is it?
He didn't say.

02:32.653 --> 02:33.737
Well, find out,
would you?

02:33.820 --> 02:34.905
Who is this?
It's Brian.

02:34.988 --> 02:36.198
It's Brian!

02:36.281 --> 02:39.117
Oh, Brian. Probably RSVPing
about Megan's party.

02:39.201 --> 02:40.410
Hello, Brian.
Hi, Stewie.

02:40.494 --> 02:41.495
What can I do for you?

02:41.578 --> 02:42.621
I'm coming to
Meg's party.

02:42.704 --> 02:43.997
Oh, splendid.

02:44.081 --> 02:45.499
Just give your information
to Mrs. Pennyapple.

02:45.582 --> 02:47.167
Hello, it's
Mrs. Pennyapple again.

02:47.251 --> 02:48.919
Shall I put you down
for two, Brendan?

02:49.044 --> 02:50.045
Brian.
Ryan?

02:50.128 --> 02:51.213
Brian!
Mitchell?

02:51.296 --> 02:52.798
What?
Good-bye.

02:54.174 --> 02:56.218
Hey, Lois, I'm ordering
a birthday cake,

02:56.301 --> 02:57.928
and the guy wants to
know how old Meg is.

02:58.011 --> 02:59.012
I didn't know
what to tell him.

02:59.096 --> 03:00.180
You're asking me?

03:00.264 --> 03:01.306
Yeah. How old is Meg?

03:01.390 --> 03:02.391
I don't know.

03:02.474 --> 03:03.642
Well, my God, Lois,

03:03.725 --> 03:05.352
I thought you were the one
keeping track of that.

03:05.435 --> 03:07.229
No, no.
I have no idea.

03:07.312 --> 03:09.898
Don't you remember me faking my
way through her last birthday?

03:11.400 --> 03:12.693
You are hmm-hmm

03:12.776 --> 03:14.695
Going on hmm-hmm

03:14.778 --> 03:17.447
Fellas will fall in line...

03:18.031 --> 03:19.116
Should we...

03:19.449 --> 03:21.869
Should we just ask her
how old she is?

03:21.952 --> 03:24.621
That, uh, that'd be
kind of awkward, huh?

03:24.746 --> 03:27.040
Hey, maybe we should just cut
off her leg and count the rings.

03:27.124 --> 03:28.125
(both laughing)

03:28.208 --> 03:30.210
Yeah. Or maybe
try carbon dating.

03:30.294 --> 03:31.295
(both laughing)

03:31.378 --> 03:32.671
I don't know
what that is.

03:32.754 --> 03:34.715
You know, we're gonna
have to talk to her

03:34.798 --> 03:36.884
and kind of steer
the conversation

03:36.967 --> 03:38.343
in a way that gets her
to spill it.

03:38.802 --> 03:40.429
(knocking)
Come in.

03:40.554 --> 03:42.681
Hi, sweetie.
Hey, Meg.

03:42.764 --> 03:45.767
So, Meg, your birthday's
coming up, huh?

03:45.893 --> 03:48.145
You excited
about turning...

03:50.522 --> 03:51.523
Huh?

03:51.607 --> 03:55.444
Uh, Meg, uh, I got 16 candles
for your birthday cake.

03:55.861 --> 03:57.029
How does that sound?

03:57.237 --> 03:58.322
That's not right.

03:58.530 --> 04:00.490
So... less...?

04:01.033 --> 04:02.534
More...?

04:02.659 --> 04:04.703
Too many...?

04:04.870 --> 04:05.913
Not enough?

04:05.996 --> 04:07.581
You stupid son
of a bitch!

04:07.664 --> 04:09.291
You didn't even
know how old I am!

04:09.374 --> 04:11.251
Meg, that kind of language
is not appropriate

04:11.335 --> 04:12.669
for a girl your age.

04:13.212 --> 04:15.422
Or is it?

04:15.506 --> 04:17.674
I'm gonna be
17, you jerks!

04:19.134 --> 04:20.719
She's the jerk.

04:24.848 --> 04:26.183
All right, come
on in, everybody.

04:26.266 --> 04:27.434
Have a seat
anywhere.

04:27.518 --> 04:29.770
Meg's gonna open her
presents in a little bit.

04:29.853 --> 04:33.023
Oh, Francis, I'm glad
you could make it.

04:33.106 --> 04:34.650
Here! Here's this
for Megan!

04:34.733 --> 04:36.735
Oh. What is it?

04:36.818 --> 04:39.696
It's a cookie from
lunch period at the home!

04:39.780 --> 04:41.615
Well, I'm sure
she'll love this.

04:41.698 --> 04:43.158
I want to see her eat it!

04:43.242 --> 04:45.452
So the man asks the bartender
to recommend a good drink.

04:45.536 --> 04:47.204
The bartender says,
"A Grasshopper."

04:47.287 --> 04:48.830
So the guy orders
a Grasshopper.

04:48.914 --> 04:50.582
Then he's walking home
and along the way,

04:50.666 --> 04:52.334
he notices a grasshopper
on the ground.

04:52.417 --> 04:53.710
So he says to
the grasshopper,

04:53.794 --> 04:55.796
"Hey, you know there's a
drink named after you?"

04:55.879 --> 04:58.340
The grasshopper says, "You mean
there's a drink named Irving?"

04:58.423 --> 05:00.592
(laughter)

05:02.845 --> 05:05.430
So which one of you wants
to lose your virginity?

05:05.514 --> 05:07.140
Mom, this
party sucks!

05:07.224 --> 05:08.475
I mean, balloons?

05:08.559 --> 05:09.852
Pin the tail
on the donkey?

05:09.935 --> 05:11.520
I'm not five
years old.

05:11.603 --> 05:14.523
Meg, your father worked very
hard to put this party together.

05:14.606 --> 05:16.775
And he says he's got
a big surprise for you.

05:16.859 --> 05:20.863
Hey, kids, I'm Peepants,
the inebriated hobo clown.

05:20.946 --> 05:23.657
I'm an adorable tramp
who wears found clothing

05:23.740 --> 05:25.117
and eats out of
your garbage can.

05:25.200 --> 05:26.451
A clown?!

05:26.535 --> 05:28.245
Dad, I'm 17!

05:28.328 --> 05:31.164
Meg, guess what Peepants
got you for your birthday.

05:31.248 --> 05:32.249
A scarf.

05:32.332 --> 05:33.542
I don't want a scarf, Dad.

05:33.667 --> 05:34.918
Well, then
how about...

05:35.043 --> 05:37.004
a dozen scarves?!

05:37.087 --> 05:39.256
(humming
circus music)

05:39.339 --> 05:41.008
(gagging)

05:41.091 --> 05:43.093
(coughing)

05:43.218 --> 05:44.511
Peter, I don't think
you're actually

05:44.595 --> 05:46.138
supposed to swallow those.

05:46.221 --> 05:47.431
(gagging)

05:47.556 --> 05:49.016
(coughing)

05:53.228 --> 05:54.229
Here you go, Meg.

05:54.313 --> 05:55.314
I don't want them!

05:55.397 --> 05:56.565
Take them!

05:56.690 --> 05:58.901
Hey, are my long johns
tied to the end of those?

05:58.984 --> 06:00.360
No.
Oh, God.

06:00.444 --> 06:01.695
(retching)

06:01.862 --> 06:04.031
(coughing)

06:06.283 --> 06:09.453
Ow! Ow!

06:09.536 --> 06:11.079
Ow!

06:11.163 --> 06:13.248
Mom, can I just open
my presents now?

06:13.332 --> 06:14.333
All right, Meg.

06:14.416 --> 06:15.417
Thank you.

06:15.709 --> 06:16.710
(paper ripping)
What the...?

06:16.793 --> 06:18.378
Well, let's see
what else we've got here.

06:18.462 --> 06:21.882
The first season
of Sister, Sister on DVD?

06:21.965 --> 06:23.175
CLEVELAND:
You're welcome.

06:23.300 --> 06:24.635
Stewie, what
are you doing?!

06:24.718 --> 06:26.136
You can't open
Meg's gifts!

06:26.303 --> 06:28.347
Hey! These are mine,
you hear me?

06:28.430 --> 06:29.431
Mine!

06:29.515 --> 06:31.725
Oh, God, not the "mine" phase.

06:31.808 --> 06:33.435
I've been dreading this day.

06:33.519 --> 06:35.145
I'm entitled to
these things, Lois.

06:35.229 --> 06:38.982
Especially after I got shafted
by that Asian Santa at the mall.

06:39.066 --> 06:40.567
What you want?! What you
want for Christmas?!

06:40.651 --> 06:43.570
Um, I was thinking maybe
one of those old-timey...

06:43.654 --> 06:45.739
Too late!
Take too long! Sad Christmas!

06:46.031 --> 06:47.115
-What you want?!
-Fire truck!

06:47.199 --> 06:48.200
-What color?!
-Red!

06:48.283 --> 06:49.284
-Next!
-(screaming)

06:50.369 --> 06:52.621
Peter, have you
been drinking?

06:52.704 --> 06:54.414
Well, a little.
It is a party.

06:54.498 --> 06:56.625
Take off that
stupid costume!

06:56.708 --> 06:57.835
You look like
a damn fool.

06:57.918 --> 06:59.336
Ah, Dad, you
won't say that

06:59.419 --> 07:01.672
when you see my grand
unicycle finale.

07:01.839 --> 07:03.131
Everyone, I'll
be right back.

07:03.215 --> 07:05.092
In the meantime,
I leave you with

07:05.175 --> 07:07.678
the musical stylings
of Chris Griffin.

07:07.970 --> 07:09.805
(soft rock playing)

07:09.888 --> 07:16.520
(screechy, off-key):
I don't know what we're afraid of

07:16.687 --> 07:22.526
Nothing would change
if we made love

07:22.609 --> 07:29.199
So I'll be your friend

07:29.283 --> 07:34.580
(falsetto):
And I'll be your lover...

07:34.663 --> 07:36.540
(sighs)

07:36.623 --> 07:38.584
All right, this is gonna
blow you guys aw...!

07:38.667 --> 07:41.503
(screaming)

07:41.587 --> 07:42.754
Grandpa!
Oh, my God!

07:42.838 --> 07:43.839
Is he breathing?

07:43.922 --> 07:45.007
Somebody call
an ambulance!

07:45.090 --> 07:48.135
Uh, Lois, maybe you better
call two ambulances.

07:52.598 --> 07:53.765
How is he, Doctor?

07:53.849 --> 07:57.019
Mrs. Griffin, his internal
injuries were much too severe.

07:57.102 --> 07:59.271
I'd estimate he'll be
dead within the hour.

07:59.354 --> 08:01.815
Dad, I'm so sorry I
broke all your ribs

08:01.899 --> 08:04.234
and busted your spleen
and punctured your lung.

08:04.484 --> 08:06.528
I don't if you can
hear me right now,

08:06.612 --> 08:10.365
but I hope you know--
I love you, Dad.

08:10.490 --> 08:12.034
Peter...

08:12.284 --> 08:14.036
come closer.

08:14.161 --> 08:16.705
There's something...
I need to say to you.

08:16.788 --> 08:18.874
I'm here, Dad.
What is it?

08:18.999 --> 08:20.459
Peter...

08:20.709 --> 08:23.629
you're a fat,
stinking drunk.

08:23.712 --> 08:24.838
(flatline tone)

08:24.963 --> 08:26.590
Oh, my God, he's dead.

08:26.673 --> 08:27.799
He can't be dead.

08:27.925 --> 08:29.927
There's got to be
something I can do.

08:30.010 --> 08:33.096
Maybe I'll bury him
in the pet cemetery.

08:33.222 --> 08:36.308
(both screaming)

08:36.391 --> 08:38.101
Okay, I'll bury him
in a regular cemetery.

08:42.731 --> 08:44.608
I can't believe
Grandpa's dead.

08:44.691 --> 08:47.402
Well, he did kind of
treat us like crap,

08:47.486 --> 08:49.696
but, yes, it is
a tragedy.

08:49.780 --> 08:51.031
It is a tragedy.

08:51.114 --> 08:52.115
Excuse us.

08:52.199 --> 08:53.992
Yeah, we'll be
right back.

09:04.086 --> 09:05.087
We're all gonna
miss him.

09:05.170 --> 09:06.171
Tragic.

09:06.296 --> 09:07.673
You know what
the worst part is?

09:07.756 --> 09:10.551
All I wanted was for my dad
to tell me he loved me.

09:10.634 --> 09:13.345
But instead, he called me
a fat, stinking drunk.

09:13.512 --> 09:14.930
Those were
his last words.

09:15.013 --> 09:17.766
Well, I hate to side
with your father, Peter,

09:17.850 --> 09:19.893
but you do kind
of drink a lot,

09:19.977 --> 09:23.188
and, you know, sometimes it
affects the people you love.

09:23.397 --> 09:24.439
Oh, my God.

09:24.523 --> 09:25.566
Lois, you're right.

09:25.649 --> 09:27.776
Booze made me fall down
all those stairs.

09:27.860 --> 09:29.486
Booze killed my father.

09:29.570 --> 09:30.946
Well, from this day forward,

09:31.029 --> 09:34.366
I, Peter Griffin,
will never drink again.

09:38.495 --> 09:39.538
Peter, what
are you doing?

09:39.621 --> 09:40.622
Crack.

09:40.706 --> 09:41.874
What the (bleep)?!

09:41.957 --> 09:43.584
Hey, at least
I'm not drinking, Brian.

09:43.667 --> 09:45.627
Yeah, this isn't exactly
a good substitute.

09:45.711 --> 09:46.837
Where'd you
get crack?

09:46.920 --> 09:48.338
From blacks.
What?

09:48.422 --> 09:50.090
Yeah, right behind
Black's Hardware Store.

09:50.174 --> 09:51.258
There's a white guy
selling it.

09:51.341 --> 09:53.510
Look, doing crack is not
the way to stop drinking.

09:53.594 --> 09:54.845
You need to get
to the heart of

09:54.928 --> 09:57.472
why you feel the need to
drink in the first place.

09:57.556 --> 09:59.016
Look, here, this
is the number

09:59.099 --> 10:00.934
of a hypnotherapist
I want you to see.

10:01.059 --> 10:02.227
All right, Brian.

10:02.311 --> 10:03.353
Good.

10:08.025 --> 10:09.234
Hey, Peter, just thought
I'd check on you.

10:09.318 --> 10:10.694
Oh, my God!

10:10.777 --> 10:14.031
Gov'ment came
and took my baby!

10:16.700 --> 10:18.410
This is mine, and this is mine,

10:18.493 --> 10:20.871
and that's mine,
and this is mine.

10:21.079 --> 10:22.206
Oh, what's this?

10:22.289 --> 10:24.458
"Hot Monogamy, the board game

10:24.541 --> 10:26.168
for failing marriages."

10:26.960 --> 10:29.546
"Dare card:
Have her do a strip tease

10:29.630 --> 10:32.591
and see how long
it takes you to get a 'bonner.'"

10:32.925 --> 10:34.176
What's a "bonner"?

10:34.301 --> 10:36.803
Stewie, what are you doing
with my jewelry box?

10:36.970 --> 10:38.430
You give that
back to Mommy.

10:38.514 --> 10:39.681
No! Go to hell!

10:39.932 --> 10:41.934
Stewie, I have had
just about enough

10:42.017 --> 10:43.936
of this new selfish
attitude of yours.

10:44.019 --> 10:45.812
Now, give that
back to Mommy!

10:45.896 --> 10:46.897
Very well, then.

10:46.980 --> 10:48.690
If I can't have it,
nobody can!

10:48.857 --> 10:49.942
That is enough!

10:51.151 --> 10:53.153
You... you struck me!

10:53.237 --> 10:54.863
(gasps)
Oh, my God.

10:55.030 --> 10:57.741
Stewie, honey,
I am so sorry.

10:57.824 --> 10:59.076
Are you okay, sweetie?

11:00.452 --> 11:02.788
(wailing)

11:02.913 --> 11:05.123
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.

11:05.207 --> 11:06.959
Mommy would never
hurt you.

11:07.042 --> 11:08.460
Let me give you a hug.

11:08.544 --> 11:09.545
(screaming):
No!

11:09.628 --> 11:12.214
(sobbing)

11:12.297 --> 11:15.467
I haven't been this scared since
Mother Teresa OD'd in my car.

11:15.551 --> 11:17.052
She is messed up, man!

11:17.135 --> 11:18.178
Shut up!
Just shut up!

11:18.262 --> 11:19.263
Let me
(bleep) think!

11:19.388 --> 11:20.389
(tires screeching)

11:20.472 --> 11:21.974
Push her out.
We can't leave her alone.

11:22.057 --> 11:23.100
Push the
bitch out!

11:24.393 --> 11:25.561
(tires screeching)

11:27.980 --> 11:31.942
Okay, now let's go back in
your mind to your childhood,

11:32.025 --> 11:33.819
to some of your
deepest memories.

11:33.902 --> 11:36.113
Yeah, I'm getting something.

11:37.197 --> 11:38.949
Happy Father's
Day, Dad.

11:39.032 --> 11:40.617
I'm not your father!

11:40.701 --> 11:42.452
Oh, my God!

11:42.661 --> 11:45.289
Francis Griffin wasn't
my real father!

11:45.455 --> 11:47.291
I wonder what else
I've repressed.

11:47.583 --> 11:49.126
Oh, my God!

11:49.209 --> 11:51.587
I could've had a V8.

11:53.672 --> 11:54.923
It was horrible, Rupert.

11:55.007 --> 11:56.175
It was like a nightmare.

11:56.300 --> 11:58.260
Lois came at me
like a wild animal.

11:58.343 --> 12:00.304
I had no way to defend myself.

12:00.596 --> 12:03.307
Mother, I'm sorry I
went against your wishes.

12:03.390 --> 12:04.474
(growling)

12:04.558 --> 12:05.726
Ow! Ow, ow!

12:05.809 --> 12:06.935
I'm sorry I
misbehaved, mother!

12:07.019 --> 12:08.562
(grunting)
I'm sorry I misbehaved!

12:08.687 --> 12:10.230
It'll never happen again!

12:10.314 --> 12:11.523
(whimpering)

12:11.607 --> 12:13.317
I love you, Mommy Dearest!

12:13.400 --> 12:14.526
(gasping)

12:14.610 --> 12:15.694
(grunting)

12:18.614 --> 12:19.948
Oh, it was awful, Rupert.

12:20.032 --> 12:21.783
I felt terrified
and brutalized

12:21.867 --> 12:23.869
and humiliated
and... and...

12:24.286 --> 12:25.913
and alive.

12:26.246 --> 12:27.414
My God, I...

12:27.497 --> 12:29.541
I haven't felt that alive
in years.

12:29.625 --> 12:31.251
Rupert, you know,

12:31.335 --> 12:33.670
I think perhaps I may be one
of those people who...

12:33.921 --> 12:35.923
gets a jolly out of being hit.

12:36.006 --> 12:38.258
Oh, Stewie, there you are.

12:38.342 --> 12:40.802
Mommy is so sorry
she hit you.

12:40.886 --> 12:43.430
I promise I will never
lay a hand on you again.

12:43.514 --> 12:45.140
Well, let's not make
any rash decisions.

12:45.224 --> 12:46.558
I mean, I did
provoke you.

12:46.642 --> 12:48.393
Come on, Lois, hit me!
Beat the crap out of me!

12:48.477 --> 12:49.770
Step on my cubes.

12:52.523 --> 12:54.608
(doorbell rings)

12:56.318 --> 12:57.611
Oh, hi, Peter.

12:57.694 --> 12:59.780
Are you here to bring
back the TV set?

12:59.863 --> 13:01.281
No, I sold it for crack.

13:01.365 --> 13:02.824
But listen, Mom, I've got
to ask you something.

13:02.908 --> 13:04.660
Who's my real father?

13:04.743 --> 13:07.829
Uh... I knew this day
would come.

13:07.913 --> 13:09.790
All right, Peter, here it is.

13:09.873 --> 13:13.001
About 40 years ago,
I was vactioning in Ireland,

13:13.126 --> 13:16.380
and I met a young rogue
named Mickey McFinnegan.

13:16.463 --> 13:19.800
Peter, Mickey is
your real father.

13:19.883 --> 13:22.594
Oh my God!
I gotta find him!

13:24.805 --> 13:26.306
To Ireland!

13:31.436 --> 13:33.313
Sweetheart, when
will you be back?

13:33.397 --> 13:34.398
I don't know, Lois.

13:34.523 --> 13:37.484
All I know is somewhere
in the great land of Ireland,

13:37.568 --> 13:39.945
is a big fat bastard
who looks like me.

13:40.028 --> 13:41.822
Call me as soon
as you can, Peter.

13:41.947 --> 13:44.032
And I really hope you
find your real father.

13:44.116 --> 13:46.159
We're gonna
miss you, Dad.

13:46.285 --> 13:48.495
Come back soon,
Daddy... I love you.

13:48.579 --> 13:50.664
That'll do, pig.
That'll do.

13:54.084 --> 13:55.127
There she is, Rupert.

13:55.210 --> 13:57.212
Oh, if I can just get her
to hit me one more time,

13:57.296 --> 13:58.881
it'll give me the rush
I've been looking for!

13:58.964 --> 14:01.300
(moans, then laughs)

14:01.383 --> 14:03.010
What's next? What's next?
What's next?

14:03.093 --> 14:04.803
Oh, God, I've been so
bloody naughty,

14:04.887 --> 14:06.430
and I need to be taught a lesson
and you're the one to do it.

14:06.513 --> 14:08.056
(screaming)

14:08.473 --> 14:11.018
Oh! Thank you!

14:11.101 --> 14:13.312
Thank you!

14:13.395 --> 14:14.897
Yeah, all that stuff.

14:14.980 --> 14:16.398
Let's make that happen.

14:17.357 --> 14:19.443
Oh, hi, sweetie.
You want some juice?

14:19.526 --> 14:20.819
Ooh, that'll be lovely.

14:22.696 --> 14:24.823
Oh, Stewie!
Yeah?

14:24.907 --> 14:26.450
Look at the mess you made.

14:26.533 --> 14:28.911
Oh, I've made a
terrible mess, haven't I?

14:28.994 --> 14:31.121
Yes, I made you take time
out of your day to clean

14:31.205 --> 14:32.831
up my mess and I should
be punished for it.

14:32.915 --> 14:35.167
Go!
Well, I guess it's not that big a deal.

14:35.292 --> 14:36.460
Accidents happen.

14:36.543 --> 14:38.504
I don't know. Don't you
think you should spank me

14:38.587 --> 14:39.713
or slice my nostril?

14:39.796 --> 14:40.797
It's all right, Stewie.

14:40.881 --> 14:41.965
Now go play.

14:42.049 --> 14:43.133
All right.

14:45.511 --> 14:47.346
Look! I've drawn
heavyweight pugilist

14:47.429 --> 14:49.765
David Tua on the wall.
Punish me!

14:49.848 --> 14:51.767
Uh, sweetie, you've
really gotta stop--

14:51.850 --> 14:53.560
huh, looks like
David Tua--

14:53.644 --> 14:55.521
You've really gotta
stop misbehaving.

14:55.604 --> 14:56.939
You're getting
on Mommy's nerves.

14:57.022 --> 14:58.565
Well, you know what'll
ease your stress?

14:58.649 --> 15:00.108
Slap me across the
face like a bitch!

15:00.192 --> 15:02.945
It's all right.
I'll get some Windex.

15:03.028 --> 15:04.613
Come on! Discipline me!

15:04.696 --> 15:06.657
Make me wear panties,
rub dirt in my eye,

15:06.740 --> 15:08.116
violate me with a wine bottle.

15:08.200 --> 15:10.619
My God, I really do have
problems, don't I?

15:13.997 --> 15:15.165
PILOT (on P.A.):
Welcome to Ireland.

15:15.249 --> 15:16.792
We'll be
landing in five minutes.

15:16.875 --> 15:18.460
This is quite
a country, Brian.

15:18.544 --> 15:20.963
You know, Ireland has more
drunks per capita than people.

15:21.046 --> 15:22.464
Oh, that's a
negative stereotype.

15:22.548 --> 15:25.217
I don't think the
Irish drink as much as people say they do.

15:27.469 --> 15:29.805
(bottles clattering)

15:36.311 --> 15:39.106
Uh, excuse me?
Is this McSwiggen Village?

15:39.189 --> 15:41.692
Ah, dibble a man who
say a word aginit, hmmm?

15:41.775 --> 15:42.985
Is that a yes or a no?

15:43.068 --> 15:44.903
Aye, tis
McSwiggen Village.

15:44.987 --> 15:47.447
Where the hills are green,
the streams are clear,

15:47.531 --> 15:49.116
and the sweaters
are so thick,

15:49.199 --> 15:51.869
even the boniest-
fingered nun could poke you in the chest

15:51.952 --> 15:53.161
and it wouldn't
bother you none.

15:53.245 --> 15:56.999
Don't be so bold
with your dark hair and your proud ways!

15:57.082 --> 15:58.375
I can't feel a thing!

16:05.090 --> 16:07.718
Hey, uh, you heard of a
man named Mickey McFinnegan?

16:07.801 --> 16:08.802
Have I heard of him?

16:08.886 --> 16:10.095
Of course I've
heard of him!

16:10.179 --> 16:11.221
He's the town drunk!

16:11.305 --> 16:12.472
Town drunk?!

16:12.598 --> 16:15.142
Oh, my God, you mean he's the
disgrace of the whole town?

16:15.225 --> 16:17.436
(laughing)

16:17.519 --> 16:19.521
You lads aren't from
around here, are ya?

16:19.688 --> 16:20.898
Top of the morning, ladies!

16:20.981 --> 16:22.608
Let me cut you an Irish rose.

16:22.733 --> 16:24.985
(farting)
(laughing)

16:25.068 --> 16:26.153
Whoo!

16:26.236 --> 16:28.530
I don't know exactly where
the County Cork is

16:28.614 --> 16:30.115
but I know where
it should be!

16:30.199 --> 16:32.159
(laughing)

16:33.702 --> 16:37.539
Around here, the town
drunk is a person of great honor.

16:37.789 --> 16:38.999
Uh, excuse me, sir?

16:39.082 --> 16:41.168
My name is Peter.
Pleased to meet you, lad.

16:41.293 --> 16:43.045
Name's Mickey.
Listen, uh...

16:43.128 --> 16:45.255
this may be hard for
you to believe but...

16:45.589 --> 16:48.509
you're my father.
Oh, am I now?

16:48.634 --> 16:51.053
Yeah, I came all the way
from America to find you.

16:51.136 --> 16:53.055
I suppose it's
money you're wantin'.

16:53.138 --> 16:54.848
I owe you some allowance
and so forth.

16:54.932 --> 16:56.308
(laughing)

16:56.391 --> 16:58.310
(all laughing)

16:58.393 --> 16:59.728
Oh, no, I don't want money.

16:59.811 --> 17:01.939
I just want to get to know you
and be friends

17:02.022 --> 17:03.815
so I can finally
have a real dad

17:03.899 --> 17:05.234
who loves and respects me.

17:05.359 --> 17:06.860
You can't be me son.

17:06.944 --> 17:08.362
You and me are
nothing alike.

17:08.445 --> 17:10.072
Just ask me
sheep, O'Brian.

17:10.155 --> 17:11.615
Who's leg do
you have to hump

17:11.698 --> 17:13.575
to get a pint of
Guinness around here?

17:15.285 --> 17:16.370
Boy it's amazing,
isn't it?

17:16.495 --> 17:18.622
You get two fathers
and neither one of them

17:18.705 --> 17:19.790
wants anything
to do with you.

17:19.915 --> 17:22.167
There's got to be some
way I can make him see

17:22.251 --> 17:24.086
that I'm worthy
of being his son.

17:24.169 --> 17:26.129
About the only way I
can ever impress him

17:26.213 --> 17:28.298
is if I was a fat
stinkin' drunk.

17:28.382 --> 17:31.802
FRANCIS:
Peter! You are afat stinking drunk.

17:31.885 --> 17:32.886
What?

17:32.970 --> 17:35.347
You're a fat stinking drunk!

17:35.430 --> 17:37.558
Yes, from what he's
told us, that's right on the money.

17:37.641 --> 17:38.934
Challenge him,
you must.

17:39.017 --> 17:40.561
And I'm Hayden
Christensen.

17:40.978 --> 17:42.604
Wait a minute,
Brian, that's it!

17:42.729 --> 17:44.731
I'm a fat stinkin' drunk

17:44.815 --> 17:47.651
because my father is
a fat stinkin' drunk.

17:47.734 --> 17:48.902
And I gotta
prove it to him.

17:49.069 --> 17:51.405
I have gotta drink him
so far under the table,

17:51.488 --> 17:53.240
he'll have no choice
but to respect me.

17:53.323 --> 17:54.783
Get me a beer, Brian.

17:54.867 --> 17:56.994
And I am going to prepare
for this as thoroughly

17:57.077 --> 17:59.288
as Ben Affleck
prepares for a role.

18:00.163 --> 18:02.666
Whoa! I've got to be
Henry VIII in 20 minutes!

18:02.749 --> 18:03.792
Hello... hallo...

18:03.876 --> 18:05.252
(English accent):
Allo, Allo.

18:05.335 --> 18:06.336
Got it.

18:08.839 --> 18:12.634
Mickey McFinnegan... I challenge
you to a drinking contest.

18:12.718 --> 18:13.719
(crowd gasps)

18:13.844 --> 18:16.346
Ha! And what makes you think
you can hold your own

18:16.430 --> 18:17.556
with the likes of me?

18:17.639 --> 18:19.933
Because I'm your son!
And I'm tough.

18:20.142 --> 18:22.519
I made it halfway through
Failure to Launch.

18:22.644 --> 18:25.397
I just never managed
to get my life together.

18:25.814 --> 18:26.815
Isn't that hilarious?

18:26.899 --> 18:29.401
(laughs):
You're cute.

18:29.818 --> 18:31.153
Done!

18:32.487 --> 18:33.822
As we say in Ireland,

18:33.906 --> 18:36.200
let's drink until
the alcohol in our system

18:36.283 --> 18:38.452
destroys our livers
and kills us.

18:41.288 --> 18:42.789
I've got 20
on the fat one.

18:42.873 --> 18:44.082
BOTH:
Which one's the fat one?

18:44.166 --> 18:45.167
(both laugh)

18:45.250 --> 18:47.377
(bleating)

18:50.422 --> 18:53.008
(speaking slurred gibberish):

18:56.178 --> 18:57.930
(speaking slurred gibberish):

19:32.464 --> 19:34.216
(grunts)

19:34.299 --> 19:36.301
-What happened?
-Peter, you won!

19:36.426 --> 19:40.097
My God, nobody's ever beat
me at the game of drink.

19:40.180 --> 19:42.224
Now do you believe
that you're my dad?

19:42.349 --> 19:45.477
Nobody but a McFinnegan
could handle that much of the creature.

19:45.602 --> 19:48.355
You're the broth of me own
stubby shillelagh, all right.

19:48.438 --> 19:50.148
Welcome to me
family, Peter.

19:50.232 --> 19:51.233
You hear that, Brian?

19:51.316 --> 19:52.526
I'm a McFinnegan now!

19:52.609 --> 19:54.278
I can forget
all about Francis.

19:54.403 --> 19:56.488
You know, there's something
you should always remember, Peter.

19:56.572 --> 19:58.490
Francis may not have
been your father,

19:58.574 --> 20:00.909
but he raised you as
if you were his own.

20:00.993 --> 20:03.704
And if that isn't love,
I don't know what is.

20:03.787 --> 20:05.747
Wow, I guess
you're right.

20:05.831 --> 20:07.165
But there is
one thing, Mickey.

20:07.249 --> 20:09.334
You knocked up my mom
and never called her again.

20:09.459 --> 20:10.460
Yeah, so what?

20:10.544 --> 20:12.379
So what? So let's dance!

20:12.462 --> 20:14.965
Oh he doesn't smell
like Irish Spring

20:15.048 --> 20:16.675
And he never taught
me anything

20:16.758 --> 20:20.429
But still I slap my chest and
sing of my drunken Irish dad

20:20.512 --> 20:22.347
Oh, his face looks like
a railroad map

20:22.431 --> 20:23.932
And he never shuts
his freakin' trap

20:24.016 --> 20:25.893
But all the ladies
catch the clap

20:25.976 --> 20:27.352
from your drunken Irish dad

20:27.436 --> 20:29.855
Ask a Hennesy, Tennesy,
Morrison, Shaughnessy

20:29.938 --> 20:31.440
Riordan and Rooney,
they'll tell you the same

20:31.523 --> 20:33.150
McNutley, Mulrooney
and Cotter and Clooney

20:33.233 --> 20:35.068
All feel the same mixture
of pride and the same

20:35.152 --> 20:37.029
Finnegan, Hannigan,
Kelly and Flannigan

20:37.112 --> 20:38.572
Look to the ground
when their dad passes by

20:38.655 --> 20:40.407
Cafferty, Rafferty,
Joyce and O'Lafferty

20:40.490 --> 20:44.828
Fight for his honor
and then start to cry

20:50.459 --> 20:51.960
(mugs clanking)

21:00.677 --> 21:03.013
Oh, we Irish lads
are all infirm

21:03.096 --> 21:04.681
And our moods infect us
like a germ

21:04.765 --> 21:08.185
'Cause we're all the spawn
of a pickled sperm

21:08.268 --> 21:09.937
And we don't
tan well, either.

21:10.020 --> 21:12.356
From a drunken Irish dad!
