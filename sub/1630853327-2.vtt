WEBVTT

00:11.177 --> 00:13.179
[machinery whirring]

00:16.016 --> 00:20.979
Okay. Order of operations...
[closes window]

00:21.396 --> 00:23.064
...goes a little something like this:

00:23.314 --> 00:27.235
Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally.

00:27.318 --> 00:28.278
[phone vibrates, chimes]

00:28.361 --> 00:33.742
"Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally"

00:33.867 --> 00:36.536
is a little mnemonic
that works really well.

00:37.328 --> 00:39.539
-You know how I know that?
-[phone chiming, vibrating]

00:43.835 --> 00:46.629
'Cause it's probably been 20 years
since I've done any algebra

00:46.713 --> 00:48.131
and I still remember it.

00:49.049 --> 00:53.386
-So, who can tell me what "P" stands for?
-[whispering]

00:53.470 --> 00:55.472
-[students chuckle]
-[phones vibrating, chiming]

00:55.555 --> 00:57.557
[grumbles]

01:00.018 --> 01:01.895
Look, I get it.

01:02.896 --> 01:05.106
This is boring, and I'm just a sub,

01:05.190 --> 01:07.650
so why should you
give me the time of day, right?

01:08.359 --> 01:09.235
Hmm?

01:10.028 --> 01:12.030
But I have seen the test.

01:12.989 --> 01:16.034
And this is on it.

01:16.117 --> 01:17.911
-[beeps]
-So...

01:18.328 --> 01:22.415
-who can tell me what "E" stands for?
-No.

01:26.878 --> 01:28.004
Are you okay?

01:30.590 --> 01:32.592
-[sobbing]
-[scattered chuckling]

01:38.306 --> 01:39.265
Hey.

01:40.350 --> 01:41.768
Can I take a look at this?

01:57.617 --> 01:59.536
Does anybody know about this photo?

02:01.621 --> 02:03.206
Let me rephrase.

02:03.289 --> 02:05.208
Who doesn't know about this photo?

02:07.836 --> 02:08.962
Seriously?

02:10.046 --> 02:11.464
No eye contact?

02:13.508 --> 02:14.717
Is it that easy?

02:18.054 --> 02:21.141
Hey! You got a human being
sitting right here.

02:25.520 --> 02:29.149
Anybody think about that
before they hit send?

02:30.859 --> 02:31.901
Give me your phones.

02:33.486 --> 02:34.445
Now!

02:35.905 --> 02:37.157
Now, phone.

02:38.116 --> 02:39.868
Phone. Give me your fucking phones.

02:39.951 --> 02:42.871
Phone, phone, phone! In the bucket, phone.

02:43.997 --> 02:45.748
Sociopaths.

02:46.374 --> 02:48.001
-[girl] What's he doing?
-Whoa!

02:48.543 --> 02:51.045
God damn emotional fucking terrorists.

02:55.091 --> 02:57.844
-[man] Hey!
-I bet you're fucking looking at me now!

02:57.927 --> 02:58.970
Hey, you!

03:00.138 --> 03:02.557
What do you think you're-- what are you--

03:02.640 --> 03:04.642
[grunting]

03:14.319 --> 03:17.405
[shouts]

03:17.488 --> 03:20.033
[theme music playing]

03:37.133 --> 03:39.844
I should be on there.
Marty Byrde to see Frank Cosgrove.

03:47.393 --> 03:48.436
[man] You're good to go.

03:48.519 --> 03:49.771
Yeah? Thank you.

03:52.523 --> 03:56.194
[Frank] <i>We got issues, Marty.</i>
<i>We got issues of trust.</i>

03:56.986 --> 03:58.488
We got issues of respect.

03:59.113 --> 04:02.158
Hell, we got issues of understanding
the basic fucking rules.

04:02.283 --> 04:03.368
[Marty] That's why we're here.

04:03.743 --> 04:05.703
That's why you're hearing about this
from us first,

04:05.912 --> 04:09.958
and it's why we're offering you
an extra 10%

04:10.708 --> 04:13.002
on top of what we're already paying you.

04:13.086 --> 04:14.587
We want to make this right.

04:14.837 --> 04:18.675
You got any idea
what my boy has been begging me...

04:19.842 --> 04:21.302
to let him do to her?

04:21.761 --> 04:23.513
What he's got every right to do.

04:25.932 --> 04:27.642
You know what "untouchable" means?

04:28.685 --> 04:30.186
I do. We do.

04:31.854 --> 04:34.691
Then why do you think you can fix this

04:35.692 --> 04:38.528
by throwing a couple of coins at my feet

04:39.237 --> 04:41.072
like I'm a fucking beggar?

04:42.532 --> 04:44.534
It's not a couple of coins.
It's an extra 10%.

04:47.620 --> 04:48.705
I want her fired.

04:50.039 --> 04:51.082
Then we talk money.

04:51.958 --> 04:53.126
I understand that you're pissed.

04:53.209 --> 04:56.462
I'd be pissed off too,
but we are not the only ones at fault.

05:00.633 --> 05:05.555
So someone else went head-first
off the top deck?

05:08.182 --> 05:10.727
Your son threatened to rat us out.

05:10.810 --> 05:11.978
[Frank Jr.] That's bullshit.

05:13.021 --> 05:15.732
[Marty]
He threatened to give up our operation.

05:16.149 --> 05:17.692
[Frank Jr.] He's fucking lying, Dad.

05:17.859 --> 05:19.360
Frank, I respect your code.

05:29.746 --> 05:30.788
Is this true?

05:32.540 --> 05:35.585
He said, "You really want to do this

05:35.668 --> 05:37.712
with everything I know about you?"

05:38.629 --> 05:40.965
[Frank Jr.] You're not gonna take
her word over mine.

05:42.925 --> 05:45.136
Frank, you're absolutely right
about trust,

05:45.511 --> 05:48.639
which is why we are willing to trust

05:48.723 --> 05:50.641
that Frank Jr. was just joking,

05:50.933 --> 05:52.518
if you are willing to trust

05:52.602 --> 05:55.938
that Ruth will not make
the same mistake twice.

06:02.195 --> 06:03.821
15%.

06:12.747 --> 06:14.040
She's untouchable, too.

06:27.970 --> 06:29.055
[Frank sighs]

06:29.806 --> 06:33.184
[Marty] Don't take any of that to mean
that you didn't completely fuck this up.

06:34.644 --> 06:37.855
[Ruth] I've been thinking about that law
of large numbers stuff

06:37.939 --> 06:42.276
and about how if we're not as enthusiastic
about catching cheaters

06:42.360 --> 06:44.445
as cheaters are about cheating us,

06:44.737 --> 06:46.572
then we're definitely getting screwed.

06:46.656 --> 06:49.367
I've been doing some poking around
about what's out there,

06:49.450 --> 06:53.246
and-- and there's a card counting team
in Indiana that's making its way west.

06:53.329 --> 06:57.583
A slot scam
where gamblers use cell phone cameras

06:57.667 --> 06:59.961
and hacked algorithm.

07:00.044 --> 07:02.505
You know, top shit. [sighs]

07:02.922 --> 07:04.424
There are card markers

07:04.507 --> 07:07.552
who use infrared ink
and special contact lenses, Marty.

07:07.885 --> 07:10.096
[Marty] I'm not paying you
to find me more problems.

07:10.179 --> 07:12.765
I'm paying you to solve them
before I even know they exist.

07:14.934 --> 07:18.312
[Wendy] Are you sure this is the only
lakefront property still available?

07:20.106 --> 07:22.358
No, no, it's for a colleague.

07:24.819 --> 07:27.613
Okay, just don't let anyone
sign a lease on it

07:27.697 --> 07:29.740
without contacting me, okay?

07:29.949 --> 07:31.576
Yeah. Thank you, Marcia. Bye.

07:32.660 --> 07:34.745
-Is this their financial report?
-[Charlotte] Yeah.

07:36.247 --> 07:37.915
Who still uses a fax machine?

07:37.999 --> 07:41.252
Well, evidently, Carl and Anita Knarlsson

07:41.502 --> 07:43.421
of the Big Muddy Casino.

07:45.089 --> 07:46.757
Is that why you were in Chicago?

07:48.384 --> 07:51.012
-Hmm?
-It's part of a bigger plan...

07:52.638 --> 07:54.432
to expand and go legit.

07:55.516 --> 07:56.684
Makes us safer.

07:57.101 --> 07:59.312
Is it your plan or your boss's?

08:00.605 --> 08:01.439
Ours.

08:02.023 --> 08:03.691
Why didn't Dad go with you?

08:04.817 --> 08:07.278
You know it can take your father
some time...

08:08.613 --> 08:10.281
to acclimate to new ideas.

08:16.329 --> 08:18.539
What did he say
about me being in Chicago?

08:20.833 --> 08:22.585
I'm not doing that, Mom.

08:23.044 --> 08:25.004
And I wouldn't do it to you, either.

08:25.087 --> 08:26.005
[Marty] Hi.

08:26.088 --> 08:27.715
-Good luck.
-[Wendy] Hey.

08:28.424 --> 08:30.635
Hey, I've been trying to call you
all morning.

08:30.927 --> 08:32.929
Oh, yeah?  Well, I was up in Kansas City

08:33.012 --> 08:38.351
because Ruth threw Frank Cosgrove Jr.
off the top deck of the casino.

08:39.727 --> 08:41.062
[Wendy laughs] Jesus.

08:41.938 --> 08:43.064
It's handled.

08:43.147 --> 08:45.483
Um, what's this? Did you--

08:45.816 --> 08:48.945
You bought a new casino and a new house
without talking to me?

08:50.029 --> 08:51.531
Those are rental properties...

08:52.406 --> 08:53.491
for Helen.

08:55.910 --> 08:57.995
-Helen's moving here?
-For the summer.

08:58.079 --> 09:00.831
-That's just fucking perfect.
-No, it's a good thing.

09:01.040 --> 09:03.668
-It's a good thing. She's on our side.
-Jesus Christ.

09:05.044 --> 09:07.547
Until she's not.
This is exactly what I was worried about.

09:07.630 --> 09:09.465
If we'd just kept our heads down, Wendy--

09:09.549 --> 09:11.217
There's nothing we can do about that now.

09:11.300 --> 09:13.928
Maybe there is.
I've had time to think through some of it.

09:14.011 --> 09:17.473
You said yourself on the phone,
we're committed.

09:17.557 --> 09:20.518
Well, deals go bad, you know?
Good plans go wrong all the time.

09:20.601 --> 09:22.895
And Navarro's a businessman,
he'll understand that.

09:23.187 --> 09:25.856
As long as we don't spend a cent
of his money, as long as he's whole,

09:25.940 --> 09:27.775
we can get out of this
before it even begins.

09:27.858 --> 09:29.318
We're not getting out of this.

09:29.402 --> 09:31.279
You're saying that
because you don't want to.

09:31.362 --> 09:33.656
I want you to admit something.
Admit this is all about you

09:33.739 --> 09:36.117
and has nothing to do
with what is best for the family.

09:36.200 --> 09:37.243
This is about me

09:37.326 --> 09:40.079
making sure you don't have to launder
for the rest of your life.

09:40.162 --> 09:43.040
This is about me
finding our only real way out of this!

09:43.541 --> 09:47.169
So, you can either be
a part of that solution, or...

09:49.505 --> 09:50.631
Part of the problem.

09:50.715 --> 09:51.757
That sounds like her.

09:51.841 --> 09:54.135
Okay, I am not arguing with you
about this.

09:55.219 --> 09:58.014
-Where are you going?
-We are going to St. Joe's,

09:58.097 --> 09:59.890
and you can look over the bid in the car.

10:00.725 --> 10:01.642
Right now?

10:01.726 --> 10:04.353
Yep. I want this deal closed
before Helen arrives.

10:13.446 --> 10:14.530
[Marty] We'll be back.

10:15.781 --> 10:17.783
[Wendy] These numbers are
from the gaming commission.

10:17.867 --> 10:21.329
They have no invested interest
in whether you hang on or sell,

10:21.412 --> 10:22.955
but their report is dire.

10:23.039 --> 10:25.082
A 35% drop in revenue.

10:25.207 --> 10:26.167
This year.

10:26.667 --> 10:29.337
Since your rivals opened across the river.

10:30.546 --> 10:33.633
Look, my point exactly.
It could just be a blip.

10:34.008 --> 10:36.469
That a business term? "Blip"?

10:37.720 --> 10:40.765
My point is everybody always goes
for the shiny new thing.

10:41.432 --> 10:45.186
Who's to say once the sheen is off,
they won't all come running right back?

10:45.436 --> 10:48.064
The view is always better
from this side of the river.

10:54.195 --> 10:56.238
You know, Carl,
it would be one thing, um...

10:56.822 --> 10:59.867
if your revenues were holding steady

11:00.493 --> 11:02.119
before that casino opened,

11:02.203 --> 11:03.954
but they've been slipping for years.

11:04.038 --> 11:05.623
Probably why you can't get a loan.

11:05.706 --> 11:07.041
You don't know that.

11:07.124 --> 11:08.459
They <i>do</i> know that.

11:08.542 --> 11:12.463
You know, you're not nursing those
30-year-old slot machines downstairs

11:12.546 --> 11:13.881
just out of nostalgia.

11:14.131 --> 11:17.009
You need a cash influx,
and, um, without one,

11:17.093 --> 11:20.137
competitors are always
gonna be shinier, always gonna be newer.

11:20.221 --> 11:22.848
The point is this place needs money.

11:24.725 --> 11:25.810
We have it.

11:26.435 --> 11:28.479
You act like we don't have a choice.

11:28.688 --> 11:30.773
[Wendy]
Honestly, I wish I could say that you did.

11:31.524 --> 11:35.361
Now, we're willing to make an offer
of 7% above market.

11:35.778 --> 11:37.988
Now, some other corporate outfit
would come in here

11:38.072 --> 11:40.866
and give you all sorts of reasons
of why that valuation's too high,

11:40.950 --> 11:42.326
but we would never do that.

11:42.910 --> 11:45.079
Because we understand how hard it is to...

11:45.663 --> 11:47.915
just to walk away
from something that you've...

11:48.332 --> 11:49.959
you've put decades into.

11:50.459 --> 11:53.754
We would never dream
of insulting that sacrifice.

11:56.215 --> 11:58.342
We'd love to take a look with our lawyers.

11:59.301 --> 12:01.011
Go ahead and send the paperwork.

12:05.224 --> 12:07.101
[Anita] Sorry about sourpuss back there.

12:07.184 --> 12:09.895
[Wendy] Oh, don't be.
I-- I hardly noticed.

12:09.979 --> 12:12.106
[laughs] Businessman of the year.

12:12.690 --> 12:14.942
[sighs] He's always been defensive
about the place.

12:15.025 --> 12:16.360
He knows what people say.

12:16.819 --> 12:19.822
"Inherited from the family,
ran it into the ground."

12:20.406 --> 12:22.950
Far as I'm concerned,
your offer's our saving grace.

12:23.409 --> 12:26.871
Carl will come around. He just needs
a little time to adjust to new ideas.

12:26.954 --> 12:28.664
-You know?
-Hmm. I do.

12:29.331 --> 12:30.416
He'll get there.

12:33.043 --> 12:35.671
[Marty] Oh, boy, that other casino
really is right there, huh?

12:36.505 --> 12:37.715
[Carl] Yes, it is.

12:38.215 --> 12:40.092
You know, on top of that,

12:40.509 --> 12:44.138
they are putting on a big Memorial Day
fireworks display.

12:44.221 --> 12:45.806
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah, like...

12:46.140 --> 12:48.809
throwing a big flaming middle finger right
in our faces.

12:48.893 --> 12:49.727
[Marty] Hmm.

12:49.810 --> 12:52.313
Calling it "Tribute to the Border War."

12:52.480 --> 12:54.023
Hey, uh, Carl,

12:54.523 --> 12:58.235
listen, I know that this is
a very frustrating situation for you,

12:58.319 --> 13:00.112
but you got a hell of a lot
to be proud of.

13:00.196 --> 13:02.990
You've been running a successful business
for, what, 25 years?

13:03.073 --> 13:05.242
With your wife? Uh...

13:06.035 --> 13:10.790
Wendy and I have been at that
for barely a year now, and it's, um...

13:11.874 --> 13:13.542
It's not easy, right? It's tough.

13:14.418 --> 13:15.336
[sighs]

13:17.713 --> 13:20.591
If it were up to you,
we wouldn't even be here, would we?

13:22.176 --> 13:24.637
Well, let me save you a world of pain.

13:25.346 --> 13:28.140

Or sit there.

28:11.147 --> 28:13.608
Buddy didn't really like
strangers touching his stuff.

28:15.819 --> 28:17.529
Two of you were close, huh?

28:19.114 --> 28:20.448
He was my best friend.

28:21.533 --> 28:24.369
Probably more interesting
than a bunch of 14-year-olds.

28:27.622 --> 28:28.873
[Ben slurping water]

28:29.499 --> 28:30.834
[turns off water]

28:31.251 --> 28:34.504
[exhales, sniffles] So what was his deal?

28:35.839 --> 28:37.132
I don't know.

28:37.924 --> 28:39.092
He was just...

28:40.969 --> 28:43.763
He let me shoot watermelons
and try his oxygen.

28:45.223 --> 28:47.892
And he went skinny-dipping every morning,
no matter who was watching.

28:49.894 --> 28:50.770
[soft chuckle]

28:56.943 --> 28:58.862
Marty Byrde for Frank Cosgrove.

29:06.202 --> 29:08.621
[Anita] This is 20% over market value.

29:10.123 --> 29:11.833
Well, this is your life's work,

29:12.709 --> 29:17.756
and we understand
that any offer must value that emotion.

29:21.050 --> 29:21.926
Honey...

29:23.136 --> 29:24.012
it's over.

29:24.095 --> 29:25.305
We held firm

29:25.513 --> 29:27.682
and drove the price up-- good for us--

29:27.766 --> 29:31.311
but if we wait any longer, that other
casino is gonna end up killing us.

29:32.520 --> 29:34.481
She's trying to walk all over us.

29:34.814 --> 29:39.110
Well, we are closing
on another casino as we speak.

29:39.194 --> 29:40.487
The only problem...

29:41.029 --> 29:43.239
um, is that there's a...

29:44.532 --> 29:46.659
there's a rival casino
right across the river.

29:46.743 --> 29:49.621
[stammers] It's bigger, and it's newer.

29:49.871 --> 29:50.789
Let me guess.

29:50.872 --> 29:53.124
You need them to have a downturn
in their business.

29:53.792 --> 29:57.670
Frank, our plan is to upgrade
and leave them in our dust.

29:57.754 --> 30:00.298
But that is gonna take time,
and it has become clear

30:00.381 --> 30:05.220
that our investors expect
an immediate return.

30:05.470 --> 30:06.346
[Frank] Huh.

30:06.888 --> 30:07.931
Tough investor.

30:09.808 --> 30:11.392
-As you are aware.
-Hmm.

30:11.518 --> 30:14.646
We are making an offer
that no one else would.

30:14.938 --> 30:16.815
[Carl] Bringing a lawyer in here,

30:17.315 --> 30:19.192
shoving papers in our faces.

30:19.275 --> 30:21.194
It's all right. We'll go.

30:22.195 --> 30:26.282
The idea that we are somehow
the bad guys here is completely juvenile.

30:26.407 --> 30:29.536
We are offering 20% above market value
for a failing business.

30:29.619 --> 30:31.704
You want to hold on to it,
oh, you be my guest.

30:31.830 --> 30:34.374
We will buy it from the bank
out of Chapter 11.

30:37.919 --> 30:39.170
[Frank] <i>What's the ask?</i>

30:39.337 --> 30:42.090
[Marty] <i>We need the other casino shut down</i>
<i>for a while.</i>

30:42.757 --> 30:43.883
That's a big ask.

30:44.634 --> 30:47.595
I can give you the trucking contract
at the new casino.

30:55.395 --> 31:00.108
At the additional 15% we negotiated
for the Belle?

31:01.109 --> 31:02.193
It's only fair.

31:02.819 --> 31:07.490
I swear to God, Carl Lee Knarlsson,
if you don't do the smart thing here.

31:07.574 --> 31:09.284
If you'll excuse me, I...

31:09.993 --> 31:13.580
I think what Anita
has been trying to say...

31:15.081 --> 31:17.166
Don't you deserve
to give up those headaches

31:17.250 --> 31:19.377
that have kept you up
for the last 25 years?

31:20.503 --> 31:22.547
I mean, don't you think it's time

31:23.631 --> 31:24.674
to enjoy your life?

31:36.728 --> 31:39.606
I'll take the papers over to the lawyer
this afternoon.

31:41.107 --> 31:42.442
Give them the once over.

31:45.820 --> 31:46.863
Then we'll sign.

31:57.373 --> 31:59.375
[cell phone vibrating]

32:15.892 --> 32:16.768
[Wendy] Hello?

32:18.227 --> 32:19.270
[Navarro] <i>Wendy Byrde.</i>

32:22.649 --> 32:23.650
Who is this?

32:24.108 --> 32:25.443
[Navarro] You know who this is.

32:26.653 --> 32:28.446
Now, can you please tell me

32:28.529 --> 32:30.573
what is happening with my casino.

32:31.240 --> 32:32.200
We got it.

32:32.492 --> 32:33.451
<i>They signed?</i>

32:35.244 --> 32:37.330
[stammers] Well, not yet, but...

32:37.747 --> 32:38.748
uh, but they've agreed.

32:40.041 --> 32:42.418
Well, then don't tell me
that you got it, okay?

32:43.503 --> 32:44.754
[heavy breathing]

32:51.010 --> 32:52.303
<i>Something happened today.</i>

32:52.720 --> 32:55.890
One of my maids, she was serving me lunch,
and she fell.

32:56.140 --> 32:58.851
And suddenly,
her front teeth were on the ground,

32:58.977 --> 33:00.186
and there was blood everywhere

33:00.269 --> 33:03.356
<i>and no other help, so I...</i>

33:04.524 --> 33:05.692
<i>Well, I picked them up.</i>

33:05.775 --> 33:10.822
<i>I didn't even realize that I had done that</i>
<i>until they were in my hand, and well...</i>

33:13.616 --> 33:17.453
I saw the red of the blood
and the white of the teeth and I thought--

33:17.704 --> 33:19.372
<i>Vamos.</i> [clicks tongue] Let's go.

33:21.791 --> 33:23.960
You think maybe that could be a bad omen?

33:24.043 --> 33:27.255
<i>I mean, I ask everyone, you know,</i>
<i>but nobody will say anything,</i>

33:27.338 --> 33:28.506
and then I thought...

33:30.425 --> 33:32.135
"Wendy Byrde."<i> </i>[laughs]

33:35.513 --> 33:38.182
Well, it sounds to me
like it was just an accident.

33:40.143 --> 33:41.102
That's all.

33:42.520 --> 33:45.773
<i>What, you don't think that an accident</i>
<i>can be an omen?</i>

33:46.232 --> 33:48.693
Well, anything can be an omen
if you're looking for it.

33:49.652 --> 33:51.946
<i>I mean, I'm sure if you went back</i>
<i>through your day,</i>

33:52.030 --> 33:55.992
<i>you could find 50 good ones</i>
<i>to help balance the bad.</i>

33:59.912 --> 34:01.956
Guess I hadn't really thought about it
that way.

34:03.374 --> 34:05.001
<i>Huh, yeah, yeah.</i>

34:05.418 --> 34:08.588
<i>I knew I would feel better</i>
<i>by talking to you.</i> [sighs]

34:09.422 --> 34:10.381
Is she okay?

34:12.341 --> 34:14.093
-Your maid?
<i>-Huh?</i>

34:14.510 --> 34:16.596
Oh, eh... I don't know.

34:17.847 --> 34:19.390
She's no longer with us, so...

34:22.143 --> 34:23.436
You have a good night.

34:24.353 --> 34:26.564
-[clicks]
-[line disconnects]

34:42.038 --> 34:43.289
Who was it?

34:44.832 --> 34:46.209
It was Helen.

34:46.959 --> 34:48.461
I'm sorry to wake you.

34:50.046 --> 34:51.881
She's just anxious about the deal.

35:11.192 --> 35:12.777
[sighs]

35:14.362 --> 35:17.365
[upbeat band music plays]

35:24.413 --> 35:26.165
[Jonah]
So what's her daughter like anyway?

35:27.041 --> 35:29.001
[Wendy] Well, I haven't met her yet,

35:29.085 --> 35:32.463
but, you know,
she's new here from Chicago,

35:32.547 --> 35:34.549
and you know how scary that is, so...

35:35.007 --> 35:37.635
you and Charlotte, you be nice. Please.

35:37.718 --> 35:39.178
We will, I promise.

35:39.554 --> 35:41.097
And no talking about...

35:41.973 --> 35:44.392
you know... anything.

35:46.102 --> 35:48.938
Most parents aren't as free with the truth
as we are.

35:53.109 --> 35:54.527
Will Ben be there?

35:55.319 --> 35:56.779
Yeah, of course.

36:00.116 --> 36:01.450
Am I really like him?

36:03.619 --> 36:04.996
What makes you wonder that?

36:06.205 --> 36:08.374
Well, when we first moved here,

36:08.457 --> 36:10.835
and you and Dad were worried that I was...

36:11.627 --> 36:14.338
I don't know, you said
you were afraid I was like him.

36:14.463 --> 36:15.715
Oh, honey...

36:18.718 --> 36:19.844
I love my brother.

36:21.012 --> 36:24.807
He'll always have a place in my heart,
but there is no comparison.

36:25.183 --> 36:26.851
-Mom. Mom.
-You understand?

36:27.059 --> 36:28.227
-I need you to hear me--
-Mom!

36:28.978 --> 36:31.063
-Wendy.
-[baby cries]

36:32.231 --> 36:33.274

36:34.609 --> 36:37.528
-Your hair's coming in nice.
-[cries]

36:39.530 --> 36:42.325
-The sun's getting in his eyes.
-Oh.

36:43.034 --> 36:45.661
Children are like corn stalks.

36:45.745 --> 36:49.624
They need fresh air and sunlight
to grow strong.

36:49.707 --> 36:51.167
Isn't that right, Zeke?

36:55.171 --> 36:56.047
Zeke?

36:58.591 --> 36:59.717
[stammers] Our Zeke?

37:02.637 --> 37:04.347
You said he went to a good family.

37:04.847 --> 37:06.265
I promise it's temporary.

37:26.535 --> 37:28.120
I'm sorry about your brother.

37:33.542 --> 37:35.795
I know how much the two of you
hate being split up,

37:35.878 --> 37:37.880
and I did try and avoid it, but you've...

37:39.882 --> 37:42.218
You know, never mind.
I'm just sorry, that's all.

37:46.681 --> 37:49.100
And I'm sorry about the situation
with your father.

37:49.684 --> 37:51.352
And I'm sorry that I'm not around more,

37:51.435 --> 37:54.897
and I'm sorry for, uh... [sighs]

37:55.439 --> 37:58.109
I don't know, a whole bunch of other stuff
that I can't even think of

37:58.192 --> 37:59.944
that I'm sure I also fucked up.

38:01.612 --> 38:03.281
Can we just try for a clean slate

38:03.364 --> 38:05.574
and leave Chicago in Chicago?

38:06.200 --> 38:07.702
Just try and enjoy the summer.

38:08.619 --> 38:09.495
I'm...

38:10.454 --> 38:12.623
actually starting to come around
on this place.

38:13.541 --> 38:14.583
Really?

38:16.127 --> 38:17.086
No.

38:23.509 --> 38:26.512
[Darlene]
Did she really think I was so stupid

38:26.929 --> 38:30.224
that I couldn't see that the sun was
in his face?

38:33.144 --> 38:35.896
[sighs]
You'd have been so proud of me, baby.

38:37.815 --> 38:39.859
Didn't so much as scowl.

38:41.027 --> 38:42.153
[door opens]

38:44.238 --> 38:46.198
I'm almost to the edge of the lane.

38:46.282 --> 38:48.534
If you want, I can start on the other side
when I'm done.

38:48.951 --> 38:49.910
[Darlene] All right.

38:51.120 --> 38:52.621
Lunch will be ready soon.

38:54.081 --> 38:57.668
[sighs] Not a single cross look.

38:58.377 --> 39:00.671
Even though I had every right

39:01.630 --> 39:03.507
to do a whole lot worse.

39:03.591 --> 39:04.508
What's that?

39:08.137 --> 39:09.972
I'm just talking to my late husband.

39:11.891 --> 39:14.060
Oh, cool.

39:15.102 --> 39:17.313
Sorry, didn't mean to interrupt.

39:18.230 --> 39:19.565
[Darlene] Do you talk to someone?

39:22.318 --> 39:23.152
What?

39:24.528 --> 39:26.072
Who do you talk to?

39:32.870 --> 39:33.788
Um...

39:35.831 --> 39:36.874
My dad.

39:37.708 --> 39:38.542
Uh-huh.

39:40.127 --> 39:42.546
You've had a lot of loss,
haven't you, boy?

39:43.464 --> 39:46.425
[sighs] It is what it is, you know?

39:46.842 --> 39:48.719
It's the Langmore curse.

39:48.969 --> 39:52.306
[Darlene laughs] Bullshit.

39:54.225 --> 39:56.352
Your daddy may have been useless,

39:56.519 --> 39:59.855
his daddy human garbage,
but before that...

40:00.314 --> 40:01.857
your folks were all right.

40:03.192 --> 40:04.902
God, back in the day,

40:04.985 --> 40:09.031
they had stills
in every kind of cove and holler.

40:10.032 --> 40:12.535
Biggest bootleggers in the Ozarks.

40:12.827 --> 40:14.453
Now, you can't pull that off

40:14.537 --> 40:17.289
unless you're tight-knit,
hardworking folks.

40:18.666 --> 40:21.001
Langmore stock is as good as any
around here.

40:21.836 --> 40:24.213
Don't let anyone tell you different.

40:28.509 --> 40:30.010
[chuckles]

40:30.428 --> 40:32.012
-Yes, ma'am.
-Mm-hmm.

40:33.639 --> 40:35.266
You still breaking and entering?

40:35.766 --> 40:38.185
I've been crashing in my car
so I don't get busted again.

40:38.644 --> 40:39.728
Hmm.

40:43.357 --> 40:45.609
I got a cabin on the property here.

40:47.236 --> 40:49.613
One of my workers used to live in it,
but...

40:50.114 --> 40:51.949
it's been empty for a while now.

40:53.409 --> 40:55.202
If you want it, it's yours.

41:03.794 --> 41:05.045
[door opens]

41:14.221 --> 41:15.055
[Helen] Hello.

41:15.681 --> 41:16.515
[Marty] Hi.

41:16.599 --> 41:19.226
-[Helen] Hi, we tried knocking.
-Hi!

41:19.310 --> 41:22.021
You must be Erin. Hey, I'm Wendy.

41:22.104 --> 41:24.732
I'm Marty. Jonah and Charlotte are dying
to meet you. They're just inside.

41:24.815 --> 41:27.151
-[stammers] Here, I'll take you in.
-[Erin] Okay.

41:28.944 --> 41:30.279
What have you got?

41:30.863 --> 41:32.948
For when our new casino becomes official.

41:34.533 --> 41:35.618
Right, yeah.

41:36.410 --> 41:37.328
Yeah.

41:41.040 --> 41:43.042
[men and women chattering]

42:14.907 --> 42:15.991
[man] Hold that door.

42:28.879 --> 42:30.381
[man 1] This one right here?

42:30.464 --> 42:33.884
[man 2] Yeah. It's gonna be 1A to 1B,
then wires there.

42:38.889 --> 42:40.266
[Ben] Sweet toy.

42:41.225 --> 42:42.810
[Jonah] It's not a toy. It's a tool.

42:43.310 --> 42:45.437
Fair enough. What's it good for?

42:46.647 --> 42:49.400
Aerial photography,
maintaining a secure perimeter,

42:49.775 --> 42:50.859
tracking wildlife.

42:51.110 --> 42:53.487
Shit, when I was your age,

42:53.571 --> 42:56.115
I'd have just used it to spy on girls.

43:12.423 --> 43:14.216
[Helen] I'd never seen a TV.

43:14.341 --> 43:16.927
-[Wendy] You didn't watch TV at all?
-[Helen] No, never. I wasn't allowed.

43:17.011 --> 43:18.721
[Wendy] You weren't allowed
to watch television ever?

43:18.804 --> 43:19.763
-[Helen] No.
-[Wendy] Huh.

43:19.847 --> 43:22.641
[Ben] I think I might have just
turned your son into a peeping Tom.

43:22.725 --> 43:24.935
-[Helen] Good thing I'm a lawyer.
<i>-</i>[Wendy] Ben, this is Helen.

43:25.019 --> 43:26.604
Helen, my baby brother, Ben.

43:26.687 --> 43:27.813
-Hi.
-Oh, hi.

43:28.606 --> 43:30.441
[Ben] So how do you guys know each other?

43:32.985 --> 43:35.070
[laughs] Um...

43:35.237 --> 43:38.157
We met through work. Nothing very special.

43:38.699 --> 43:41.910
[Erin] Yeah, I'd pull a Sylvia Plath
if I had to work for my mom.

43:42.036 --> 43:43.746
[Charlotte laughs] It's not that bad.

43:44.163 --> 43:45.914
Plus, if I do a good job in there,

43:45.998 --> 43:48.417
she pretty much lets me do
whatever I want out here.

43:48.834 --> 43:50.127
-Seriously?
-Yeah.

43:53.547 --> 43:55.341
I could show you around if you want.

43:55.966 --> 43:58.093
We can rent jet skis or go caving.

43:59.762 --> 44:01.722
Plus I have the hookup
for some pretty good weed

44:01.805 --> 44:03.390
if you're into that kind of thing.

44:05.142 --> 44:06.852
What about Party Cove?

44:08.646 --> 44:10.731
Party Cove gets old fast.

44:11.982 --> 44:13.984
It's basically just a bunch
of college kids

44:14.068 --> 44:15.778
who come down for the weekend,

44:16.320 --> 44:20.032
get wasted, go crazy,
and they just go home.

44:30.125 --> 44:33.379
Every other girl in my grade's
already lost her virginity.

44:34.421 --> 44:39.093
If I do it here, I get it out of the way,
but I'm not stuck seeing him every day.

44:41.595 --> 44:43.764
Honestly, I don't care who it is.

44:43.847 --> 44:46.183
I just cannot go back to Chicago a virgin.

44:49.770 --> 44:50.688
[Jonah sighs]

44:52.064 --> 44:52.940
Damn it!

45:15.170 --> 45:17.256
[laughing]

45:17.339 --> 45:20.926
Your mom had the thickest Carolina accent
of any of us.

45:21.009 --> 45:25.013
-That is so not true.
-Oh, Marty, help me out here.

45:25.139 --> 45:27.307
When you first met Wendy,
what did she sound like?

45:30.144 --> 45:33.564
I refuse to answer on the grounds
that she is sitting right here,

45:33.647 --> 45:35.190
-and she's listening.
-[Ben laughing]

45:36.525 --> 45:39.111
-Do you...
-[laughing]

45:39.194 --> 45:41.780
[Ben] You remember how we used to say

45:41.947 --> 45:44.199
that you were the only one in the world

45:44.283 --> 45:47.745
who could turn the word "down"
into six syllables?

45:47.828 --> 45:50.330
-Unh-unh, that was Aunt Millie.
-Aunt Millie was five.

45:50.456 --> 45:51.540
You were six.

45:51.623 --> 45:54.293
Hmm! Your uncle has
a very fanciful imagination.

45:54.376 --> 45:55.669
[Ben laughs]

45:55.753 --> 45:57.463
-Hi.
-Sorry I'm late.

45:57.546 --> 45:59.715
[Ben] Hey, look who it is. <i>Guten abend!</i>

45:59.840 --> 46:01.759
Take my seat. I'll get another one.

46:04.470 --> 46:05.429
You hungry?

46:05.512 --> 46:07.431
No, I'm good, thanks.

46:10.309 --> 46:11.727
Good to see you again, Ruth.

46:13.020 --> 46:14.021
You, too.

46:16.315 --> 46:17.858
This is my daughter Erin.

46:18.484 --> 46:20.486
["America the Beautiful"
playing over speakers]

46:24.156 --> 46:27.326
What the fuck? Nothing's happening.

46:27.451 --> 46:28.368
Wait.

46:31.914 --> 46:33.165
Just wait.

46:36.668 --> 46:39.004
[clamoring]

46:42.132 --> 46:43.133
Fucking A.

46:46.637 --> 46:48.639
[overlapping shouts]

46:51.016 --> 46:53.018
[laughing]

46:53.936 --> 46:56.188
-So how long are you staying for, Ben?
-[Ben] Hmm.

46:56.271 --> 46:58.023
Just a couple days, right?

46:58.106 --> 47:00.442
Not that we don't love having him,
it's just...

47:00.567 --> 47:02.486
you know, he is always on the move.

47:02.569 --> 47:06.323
[Ben sighs]
Anybody want something from the bathroom?

47:06.406 --> 47:08.408
[cell phone vibrates]

47:09.910 --> 47:13.247
[Wendy] Anita,
I hope you're calling with good news.

47:13.330 --> 47:15.791
[Anita] <i>Well, I guess that depends</i>
<i>on your perspective.</i>

47:15.874 --> 47:17.125
I don't understand.

47:18.001 --> 47:21.421
[Anita] Seems our rivals have gone
and set themselves on fire.

47:21.713 --> 47:24.424
It's gonna be months
before they can reopen.

47:25.217 --> 47:26.218
So...

47:27.010 --> 47:29.847
we're gonna be able
to get that bank loan and upgrade.

47:30.806 --> 47:33.517
-We're backing out of the deal.
-[Wendy] <i>You can't do that.</i>

47:33.892 --> 47:34.852
[Anita] <i>But I am.</i>

47:35.018 --> 47:37.563
<i>Our handle's about to go up</i>
<i>a million dollars a month.</i>

47:38.397 --> 47:40.482
But we had an agreement.

47:40.607 --> 47:42.484
<i>A verbal agreement.</i>

47:44.236 --> 47:47.447
[stammers] Anita, where is this
coming from? This isn't you.

47:47.531 --> 47:50.742
Oh, please.
Don't pretend we had a relationship.

47:51.034 --> 47:53.620
"This is your life's work." Really?

47:53.704 --> 47:56.164
<i>You were a carpetbagger, plain and simple.</i>

47:56.415 --> 47:58.792
I was your fucking salvation.

47:59.877 --> 48:01.086
I'll take you to court.

48:01.169 --> 48:02.588
<i>-You could try.</i>
-Well, I will.

48:02.671 --> 48:05.257
<i>And for the record,</i>
<i>you humiliated my husband.</i>

48:05.340 --> 48:06.216
Me?

48:06.300 --> 48:08.552
You and that lesbian lawyer.

48:09.428 --> 48:12.639
He's a weak man,
and you let him know that, didn't you?

48:12.806 --> 48:14.224
<i>Oh, you know, that's really...</i>

48:14.308 --> 48:16.059
<i>That is really rich.</i>

48:16.143 --> 48:18.437
And if you think
for one fucking second--

48:18.520 --> 48:19.396
Quiet.

48:24.443 --> 48:26.486
[Helen] I can't believe
they had it in them. [exhales]

48:26.570 --> 48:28.488
Sat there looking at us
like we're vultures

48:28.572 --> 48:30.699
and all the time,
they're fucking arsonists?

48:31.241 --> 48:33.368
-What can we do?
-She's right about court.

48:34.620 --> 48:36.997
Even if they win,
it'll be tied up for years.

48:38.749 --> 48:40.000
Shit.

48:45.547 --> 48:47.549
We must have some recourse.

48:48.342 --> 48:51.428
More money is out of the question.
I can't ask my client again.

48:53.138 --> 48:55.641
I'll figure something out.
I'm not losing to that woman.

48:58.435 --> 48:59.478
[Marty] Was anyone hurt?

49:01.229 --> 49:02.522
In the fire.

49:04.816 --> 49:06.652
[Helen] Who knows and who cares?

49:07.027 --> 49:08.195
[Marty] Well, you know, she--

49:08.278 --> 49:10.280
She said that
the whole thing went up, so...

49:10.364 --> 49:11.949
must have been a lot of people inside.

49:28.966 --> 49:30.968
[men and women laughing, chattering]

-Yes! Yeah! Oh!

49:54.574 --> 49:57.494
[woman on TV] <i>Well, Memorial Day weekend</i>
<i>is finally here,</i>

49:57.619 --> 50:00.539
<i>and that means the summer party season...</i>

50:00.622 --> 50:03.542
-[Marty] Good morning.
-[turns off TV]

50:03.625 --> 50:06.920
Um, listen, Ben,
I have been thinking a lot about this...

50:07.004 --> 50:09.631
[clears throat] ...and I think that the,
uh, best thing to do is

50:09.715 --> 50:13.343
to just be completely honest with you.
Um...

50:14.052 --> 50:14.886
[exhales]

50:15.429 --> 50:18.473
This is not a good time for us here
in this house.

50:18.557 --> 50:21.351
Uh, there's-- There's a lot going on.

50:21.560 --> 50:23.020
Um, Wendy...

50:23.645 --> 50:26.606
uh, has not been herself.

50:28.400 --> 50:30.485
-Um--
-Are you asking me to leave?

50:35.157 --> 50:36.366
Thank you for understanding.

50:37.868 --> 50:39.244
But I don't understand.

50:41.496 --> 50:45.792
Honestly, this is the first time
I've recognized my sister in years.

50:49.129 --> 50:50.255
Well, you know...

50:53.425 --> 50:56.970
I need you to go, okay, Ben?

50:57.512 --> 50:59.431
I need you to go,
and if money is an issue--

50:59.514 --> 51:00.974
I don't want your money.

51:03.518 --> 51:05.312
[sighs] I kind of...

51:06.313 --> 51:09.733
skipped a bench warrant
in North Carolina, so...

51:10.567 --> 51:13.528
right now this place
is basically my salvation.

51:15.822 --> 51:16.782
Don't worry.

51:16.907 --> 51:18.366
All I want to do is chill.

51:18.950 --> 51:21.787
[laughs] You won't even know I'm here.

51:22.329 --> 51:23.371
Mm-hmm.

51:24.623 --> 51:25.624
Yeah...

51:27.751 --> 51:28.710
[sighs]

51:31.379 --> 51:33.006
Yeah... okay.

51:38.470 --> 51:39.554
[turns on TV]

51:40.847 --> 51:43.725
[Ruth] Wendy, the slots
at the other casino, what are they?

51:43.809 --> 51:46.019
Three-reel? Five-reel? Video?

51:46.812 --> 51:48.146
Mainly three-reel.

51:48.814 --> 51:50.690
I was doing some research for Marty

51:50.774 --> 51:53.985
about different ways
our casino might be vulnerable,

51:54.069 --> 51:57.239
and I realized we might be able
to use what I learned

51:57.322 --> 51:59.616
to play offense instead of defense,

52:00.033 --> 52:01.243
if you catch my drift.

52:01.952 --> 52:03.411
Explain it to me in the car.

52:08.542 --> 52:10.544
[tapping keyboard]

52:21.012 --> 52:23.473
Hello, there.
If you'd given me a heads-up,

52:23.557 --> 52:25.267
I could have arranged for a tour.

52:25.934 --> 52:28.395
What do you think happened
at that casino last night?

52:30.605 --> 52:33.400
Boy, I mean,
your guess is as good as mine.

52:33.817 --> 52:36.653
So, why did Wendy look like she thought
maybe you did know?

52:40.240 --> 52:41.408
I don't know.

52:41.491 --> 52:42.826
Where's this coming from?

52:42.909 --> 52:44.828
It's coming from
is that I'm starting to sense

52:44.911 --> 52:46.788
that you two aren't exactly
on the same page

52:46.872 --> 52:48.582
about this expansion plan.

52:49.207 --> 52:50.041
Hmm.

52:51.668 --> 52:53.920
As you know, I don't like to take on
unnecessary risk.

52:54.004 --> 52:56.047
I'm not talking about
philosophical differences.

52:56.464 --> 52:58.592
I'm talking about something deeper.

52:58.925 --> 53:00.093
In case you hadn't noticed,

53:00.177 --> 53:02.888
this plan now involves
more than just the two of you.

53:02.971 --> 53:06.349
So, when you have problems,
they become my problems.

53:07.058 --> 53:09.644
I think you should be having this
conversation with the both of us.

53:09.728 --> 53:11.271
Wendy isn't the issue here.

53:14.191 --> 53:17.110
Just be thankful that she and Ruth
have got us back on track.

53:20.697 --> 53:21.698
You didn't know.

53:23.700 --> 53:25.577
Of course I knew.
I'm surprised that, uh...

53:25.660 --> 53:27.287
that you did so soon.

53:28.663 --> 53:29.581
Good.

53:34.419 --> 53:36.421
[gamblers chattering]

53:45.430 --> 53:47.098
[man] <i>All right. That looks good.</i>

53:49.726 --> 53:52.354
<i>And... go.</i>

53:58.526 --> 53:59.653
And... now.

54:01.071 --> 54:04.241
<i>-Hey, Lulu, ready?</i> <i>And... hit it.</i>
-[bells chiming]

54:08.286 --> 54:10.914

54:12.374 --> 54:14.334
<i>Amber... go.</i>

54:23.051 --> 54:24.135
[Ruth] Wendy?

54:26.221 --> 54:27.389
Wendy, hello?

54:28.807 --> 54:30.642
Does that mean it's working?

54:30.725 --> 54:32.477
<i>-Hello--</i>
-Like gangbusters.

54:32.560 --> 54:33.645
[laughs]

54:33.728 --> 54:36.940
Don't let up.
I want them stunned into submission.

54:37.816 --> 54:38.817
<i>All righty.</i>

54:46.324 --> 54:47.993
Hey, so is this legal?

54:48.618 --> 54:49.494
[cell phone chimes]

54:50.620 --> 54:51.621
[Ruth] <i>Hey, what's up?</i>

54:51.705 --> 54:53.290
Yeah, hey. Um...

54:54.416 --> 54:55.500
What are you doing?

54:56.084 --> 54:57.168
<i>What do you mean?</i>

54:57.419 --> 54:58.878
I mean, right now,

54:59.254 --> 55:00.839
<i>tell me what you're doing.</i>

55:00.922 --> 55:05.218
I'm using the slot scam I told you about
on Big Muddy,

55:05.593 --> 55:08.013
forcing them back
to the negotiating table.

55:08.096 --> 55:09.264
<i>-No, no, no!</i>
-Why?

55:09.639 --> 55:11.057
You have to stop that.

55:11.474 --> 55:13.768
[stammers] What? I can't.
It's already done.

55:18.940 --> 55:21.359
<i>Why didn't you tell me</i>
<i>that you were gonna do that, Ruth?</i>

55:21.901 --> 55:24.321
You-- You made a big deal

55:24.404 --> 55:27.407
about how I'm not supposed
to be bringing problems,

55:27.490 --> 55:28.992
how I'm supposed to be solving them.

55:29.075 --> 55:30.785
<i>I'm just doing what you fucking wanted.</i>

55:30.869 --> 55:32.078
Okay, but you're not.

55:32.162 --> 55:34.539
You're completely screwing us.

55:34.622 --> 55:36.875
By getting you another casino

55:36.958 --> 55:40.045
when no one else could figure out
how the fuck to do it?

55:40.170 --> 55:42.088
Are you fucking kidding me, Marty?

55:42.172 --> 55:44.007
<i>How about a little gratitude?</i>

55:44.090 --> 55:46.343
<i>I mean, your wife seems</i>
<i>pretty fucking grateful.</i>

55:46.468 --> 55:49.637
Wendy has absolutely no idea
what is good for us.

55:49.721 --> 55:50.722
<i>Is that my fault?</i>

55:50.805 --> 55:53.892
Is that my fault that you can't
communicate for shit with your wife?

55:53.975 --> 55:55.935
-All right, Ruth, listen to me.
<i>-No, no.</i>

55:56.019 --> 56:00.023
How's about instead of shitting on me,
you get your own house in order?

56:00.106 --> 56:03.568
And until you do,
how's about you fuck off?

56:03.985 --> 56:06.363
<i>-All righty?</i>

56:06.905 --> 56:09.157
-[bells ringing]
-[cheering]

56:26.508 --> 56:28.385
Looks like your boat sprung a leak.

56:29.010 --> 56:31.346
To the tune of, I'd say...

56:32.389 --> 56:35.350
200,000 grand per hour.

56:35.642 --> 56:37.685
[Anita]
You're not gonna cheat us into selling.

56:38.937 --> 56:41.606
I'm only saying what everyone
on the floor is seeing.

56:42.941 --> 56:46.361
Wow. Another five grand.

56:47.821 --> 56:50.407
If, however, you'd like a life raft,

56:50.490 --> 56:53.868
we'd still be happy to purchase
your casino from you, for say...

56:55.412 --> 56:59.416
three million under the previous offer,
since its value is depreciating...

57:00.583 --> 57:01.626
swiftly.

57:03.628 --> 57:06.423
What we'd like is for you
to get the hell out of our casino.

57:09.509 --> 57:13.221
The longer you hold on,
the lower our offer drops,

57:13.555 --> 57:14.931
since your slots are hemorrhaging.

57:15.432 --> 57:17.016
We'll kick out the cheaters.

57:18.852 --> 57:21.604
We'll bring in different people every day.

57:21.688 --> 57:24.399
We'll unplug the machines,
stop the bleeding.

57:25.442 --> 57:27.610
Well, according to your financials,

57:27.694 --> 57:30.113
slots bring in 80% of your revenue.

57:34.826 --> 57:36.327
How's that life raft sounding?

57:41.332 --> 57:44.127
[drone buzzing]

57:56.639 --> 57:57.724
Cut it out!

57:59.392 --> 58:00.560
Jonah!

58:01.311 --> 58:02.479
[Jonah] Didn't see you there.

58:08.443 --> 58:10.945
And... done.

58:11.321 --> 58:12.947
-[Helen laughing]
-I need more.

58:23.041 --> 58:26.753
-[line rings, connects]
-[sighs]

58:26.836 --> 58:28.463
Hi, it's me. Is it a bad time?

58:29.047 --> 58:30.965
You know I'm just getting off work.

58:32.383 --> 58:35.261
<i>I just wanted to apologize for my tone</i>
<i>the other day.</i>

58:35.428 --> 58:36.513
I'm listening.

58:36.804 --> 58:39.432
<i>I need to remember that</i>
<i>even though we don't always agree,</i>

58:39.516 --> 58:42.101
<i>you'll always have the kids'</i>
<i>best interests at heart.</i>

58:42.435 --> 58:43.728
Look-- [shouts]

58:46.439 --> 58:47.273
<i>Gene?</i>

58:48.566 --> 58:49.776
[grunting]

58:56.407 --> 58:58.409
[Gene whimpering]

59:02.789 --> 59:04.624
Are you kidding? It's gorgeous here.

59:04.916 --> 59:06.626
Tell me, how are things with you?

59:24.310 --> 59:25.228
[Marty] What's this?

59:25.353 --> 59:28.147
A warrant signed by a federal judge

59:28.565 --> 59:31.609
that was triggered the minute
you purchased a second casino.

59:35.613 --> 59:37.240
[sniffles, clears throat]

59:43.913 --> 59:46.708
This is an integrated audit
of your whole operation.

59:47.500 --> 59:50.003
A team of forensic accountants
who will supervise

59:50.086 --> 59:52.672
every casino transaction as it happens.

59:53.923 --> 59:57.218
Every invoice and receipt,
they'll be there when it's printed.

59:57.844 --> 1:00:00.430
Every hour,
they'll count the chips on the floor.

1:00:01.347 --> 1:00:04.100
For the next month, we're gonna be
running this place with you.

1:00:11.190 --> 1:00:13.067
Do you know what I miss most
about Chicago?

1:00:13.151 --> 1:00:14.986
-[Helen] What's that?
<i>-</i>Johnny's Beef.

1:00:15.069 --> 1:00:16.863
-[Helen gasps]
-You ever been to Johnny's Beef?

1:00:16.946 --> 1:00:18.197
-Hi.
-[Wendy] Hey, hi!

1:00:19.782 --> 1:00:21.826
We've got new partners in the casino.

1:00:32.128 --> 1:00:33.171
[Ben shouting]

1:00:34.631 --> 1:00:35.882
[continues shouting]

1:00:50.229 --> 1:00:51.522
[shouts]

1:00:55.109 --> 1:00:57.111
[Jonah] <i>Son of a bitch!</i>

1:00:59.822 --> 1:01:01.783
