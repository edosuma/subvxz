01:02:50.934 --> 01:02:53.562
His luck will run out.

01:02:54.188 --> 01:02:56.398
Not depending on luck.

01:02:59.276 --> 01:03:03.113
We walked into that apartment exactly
one year after he tied Victor to the bed.

01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:05.199
One year to the day.

01:03:05.365 --> 01:03:07.659
He wanted us to.
Don't know that for sure.

01:03:07.826 --> 01:03:09.578
Oh, yes, we do.

01:03:10.370 --> 01:03:12.289
This note he left.

01:03:12.456 --> 01:03:14.166
His first words to us.

01:03:14.890 --> 01:03:18.190
"Long is the way and hard,
that out of Hell leads up to light,."

01:03:20.798 --> 01:03:22.007
Fuck him. So what?

01:03:22.174 --> 01:03:24.051
He's right, so far.

01:03:24.218 --> 01:03:28.722
Imagine the will it takes
to keep a man bound for a full year.

01:03:28.889 --> 01:03:32.726
To sever his hand
and use it to plant fingerprints.

01:03:32.893 --> 01:03:35.687
To insert tubes
into his genitals.

01:03:36.104 --> 01:03:40.901
This guy is methodical, exacting,
and worst of all, patient.

01:03:41.276 --> 01:03:43.028
He's a nut bag.

01:03:43.195 --> 01:03:47.449
And just because the fucker's got
a library card doesn't make him Yoda.

01:03:51.787 --> 01:03:55.123

What would he study
to do the things he's done?

01:04:13.100 --> 01:04:15.143
What are his interests now?

01:04:15.644 --> 01:04:17.437

this conversation is admissible.

with his plea.

No, it is true.

all this work...

01:43:13.396 --> 01:43:15.398
...two months from now,
no one's gonna care.

01:43:24.782 --> 01:43:26.117
...when it's finished...

01:43:27.952 --> 01:43:29.454
...it's going to be...

01:43:32.457 --> 01:43:35.793

to comprehend.

can't. It's really going to be something.

Nothing wrong with a man

I won't deny my own personal desire
to turn each sin against the sinner.

did was kill innocent people.

01:46:39.435 --> 01:46:42.021
Innocent?
Is that supposed to be funny?

01:46:42.897 --> 01:46:44.357
An obese man.

01:46:44.524 --> 01:46:47.026
A disgusting man who
could barely stand up.

01:46:47.193 --> 01:46:51.489
If you saw him, you'd point him out to your
friends so they'd join you in mocking him.

A man, who if you saw him
while you were eating...

01:46:54.117 --> 01:46:56.661
...you wouldn't be able
to finish your meal.

And after him, lawyer. You must've
secretly been thanking me for that one.

01:47:00.998 --> 01:47:03.918
This is a man who
dedicated his life...

...to making money by lying with
every breath that he could muster...

01:47:08.881 --> 01:47:11.759

rapists on the streets.

- A woman.

01:47:13.511 --> 01:47:15.596
- Murderers, John, like yourself?
- A woman...

01:47:15.763 --> 01:47:18.474
...so ugly inside that she
couldn't bear to go on living...

01:47:18.641 --> 01:47:20.935
...if she couldn't be
beautiful on the outside?

01:47:21.102 --> 01:47:25.523
A drug dealer. A drug
dealing pederast, actually.

01:47:25.690 --> 01:47:28.359
And let's not forget
the disease-spreading whore.

01:47:30.611 --> 01:47:33.030

01:47:33.197 --> 01:47:36.909

innocent people and keep a straight face.

But that's the point.

01:47:43.166 --> 01:47:46.210
We see a deadly sin
on every street corner...

01:47:46.377 --> 01:47:49.255
...in every home and
we tolerate it.

01:47:49.922 --> 01:47:52.675
We tolerate it
because it's common, it's...

01:47:52.842 --> 01:47:54.510
It's trivial.

01:47:54.677 --> 01:47:57.638
We tolerate it morning,
noon and night.

01:48:00.725 --> 01:48:02.894

Why's that, John?

01:48:29.295 --> 01:48:32.423
Because you're going
to be remembered after this.

01:48:32.590 --> 01:48:36.427
Realize, detective, the only reason
that I'm here right now...

01:48:36.594 --> 01:48:38.638
...is that I wanted to be.

01:48:38.804 --> 01:48:41.307
No. No, we would've
got you eventually.

01:48:42.934 --> 01:48:47.188
So, what were you doing,
biding your time? Toying with me?

01:48:47.772 --> 01:48:53.194
Allowing five innocent people to die
until you felt like springing your trap?

01:48:53.361 --> 01:48:57.448
Tell me, what was the indisputable
evidence you were going to use on me...

01:48:57.615 --> 01:49:02.078
...right before I walked up to you
and put my hands in the air?

01:49:02.245 --> 01:49:04.455

knocking on your door.

Oh, that's right.

01:49:09.335 --> 01:49:12.672
And I seem to remember
breaking your face.

01:49:17.426 --> 01:49:20.263
You're only alive because
I didn't kill you.

for the rest of your life...
