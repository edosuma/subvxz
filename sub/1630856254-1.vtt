34:14.929 --> 34:15.764
It's them.

34:21.687 --> 34:22.688
Let's go.

42:59.037 --> 42:59.913
Of course.

43:17.764 --> 43:19.933
Nobody needs to know.

43:19.933 --> 43:22.352
If you want to speak about
what's in the case,

43:22.352 --> 43:24.146
it will stay between us.

43:33.197 --> 43:34.656
Goodbye, my love.

43:51.924 --> 43:53.300
Yes, exactly.

01:04:28.702 --> 01:04:30.078
Would you like some pepper?

01:04:30.078 --> 01:04:32.289
I don't want pepper.

01:04:32.289 --> 01:04:34.208
I want to be alone with my wife.

01:05:00.275 --> 01:05:02.486
I don't know, it has been a while.

01:05:03.028 --> 01:05:04.571
I have traveled around the world.

01:05:05.781 --> 01:05:08.992
Despite that,
it's hard to tell you the truth.

01:05:08.992 --> 01:05:12.454
I'm afraid to break your heart.

01:05:12.996 --> 01:05:16.458
I don't know if you will still love me...

01:05:16.458 --> 01:05:19.711
once you know who I truly am.

01:05:20.128 --> 01:05:24.007
I'm sorry that you're
being pulled into this...

01:05:24.007 --> 01:05:25.300
but I swear on my life...

01:05:25.300 --> 01:05:27.344
that I'll never let any person...

01:05:27.344 --> 01:05:31.974
hurt you or the kids.
