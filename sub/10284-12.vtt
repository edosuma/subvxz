00:44.410 --> 00:45.320

00:49.440 --> 00:51.080
not for me, but you got to admit she's a great women

00:51.080 --> 00:53.070
If Shekela need a role model,

00:53.070 --> 00:54.100
she could turn on Oprah

00:54.100 --> 00:56.430
What if Shekela wants to be secretary of state

00:56.430 --> 00:58.820
well then, she can look on Madeleine Albright

00:58.950 --> 01:01.330

Time to dial back on an escort service

01:31.870 --> 01:33.810

01:33.810 --> 01:36.200

- Cool hat.

02:01.450 --> 02:03.030
I like your necklace.

02:03.030 --> 02:04.020
Thank you.

02:04.020 --> 02:05.510
My kid gave it to me.

02:05.510 --> 02:06.960
He's about your age.

02:06.960 --> 02:08.139
Hey.

02:08.889 --> 02:10.419
She's shadowing me today.

02:11.150 --> 02:12.510
You didn't clear that with me.

02:12.510 --> 02:14.260
I talked to Kovac and Weaver about it.

02:14.260 --> 02:16.210
Yeah,but you didn't talk to me.

02:16.210 --> 02:19.330
You must be that guy that's
always riding Uncle Tony.

02:19.330 --> 02:20.490
You know like a bull in heat.

02:22.090 --> 02:25.200
So,uh,what else does
Uncle Tony say about me?

02:25.890 --> 02:27.660
The rest I'm not allowed to say.

02:28.840 --> 02:32.090
Just make sure she signs a
confidentiality form and if she gets hurt,

02:32.090 --> 02:35.930
she's your
responsibility,understood,Uncle Tony?

02:35.930 --> 02:37.210
Aye,aye,Captain.

02:38.640 --> 02:40.640
Kerry,this is huge.

02:40.640 --> 02:42.560
Do you know how hard it is
to get your own morning show?

02:42.560 --> 02:44.980
It's not my own show I'd
just be the health reporter..

02:44.980 --> 02:47.610
Full time,with your own daily segment.

02:47.610 --> 02:50.120
It's flattering,but I am a doctor.

02:50.120 --> 02:53.840
Who just got demoted from a hospital
she worked at for over ten years.

02:53.840 --> 02:54.990
I love medicine.

02:54.990 --> 02:57.250
I've never pictured
myself doing anything else.

02:57.250 --> 02:59.610
You'd still be able to
do that.On you own show.

02:59.610 --> 03:01.010
Would you stop saying that?

03:01.010 --> 03:03.580
I'm not leaving Chicago.
I'm not leaving my friends.

03:03.580 --> 03:05.740
And I'm not pulling Henry
out of his pre-school.

03:05.740 --> 03:08.260
You can find another pre-school.

03:08.260 --> 03:10.760
Yvonne Davillere,37,tripped
and fell on the sidewalk.

03:10.760 --> 03:11.990
My leg just gave out.

03:11.990 --> 03:13.680
- Any LOC?
- Negative. Good vitals.

03:13.680 --> 03:14.900
I don't know what happened.

03:14.900 --> 03:16.060
I've got to take this.

03:16.060 --> 03:18.170
Forehead contusion and knee abrasion.

03:18.170 --> 03:19.860
We need to clear her neck. Let's roll.

03:19.860 --> 03:20.620
This is hers.

03:20.620 --> 03:21.820
Do you know where you are?

03:21.820 --> 03:23.350
I know I'm not home.

03:23.350 --> 03:25.800
Kerry,it's Miami. You've got to consider it.

03:25.800 --> 03:27.150
When does the station want an answer?

03:27.150 --> 03:28.340
By tomorrow afternoon.

03:28.340 --> 03:29.770
Well,you better start thinking about it.

03:29.770 --> 03:31.740
I already have. I'm not doing it.

03:31.740 --> 03:34.710
C- spine,access trauma two.

C- spine's clear.

03:49.520 --> 03:51.170
Getting naked at the Delano,Miami.

03:51.170 --> 03:52.660
Let's take her off the board.

03:52.660 --> 03:53.920
Is my sketchbook here?

03:53.920 --> 03:55.610
Yeah,it's in the corner.
Ready?

03:56.430 --> 03:58.770
You can't steal my 15 minutes
and then punt them away.

03:58.770 --> 04:00.390
Not now,Morris.

04:00.390 --> 04:02.110
- Are you an artist?
- A painter.

04:02.110 --> 04:03.490
Open your mouth,please.

04:04.260 --> 04:08.590
No intra-oral trauma or dental fractures.

04:08.590 --> 04:10.820
Glucose is 295.

04:10.820 --> 04:11.750
Do you have diabetes?

04:11.750 --> 04:14.700
My sugar's always been a little high.
I'm supposed to watch my diet.

04:14.700 --> 04:16.290
Are you on any medications?

04:16.290 --> 04:18.220
Clindamycin... for my foot.

04:18.579 --> 04:22.330
Chronic infection at the base of the
second toe with some surrounding cellulitis.

04:22.330 --> 04:23.600
Does this hurt?

04:23.830 --> 04:26.790
I've been limping for awhile,but I'm fine.

04:26.790 --> 04:29.560
Okay,let's get a foot
series and culture the wound.

04:30.530 --> 04:32.050
Kerry,Kerry...

04:32.050 --> 04:35.280
Listen,listen,listen. You could
be the next Judge Judy,Dr. Phil...

04:35.280 --> 04:37.090
No,no,no,Ellen.

04:37.090 --> 04:38.760
Go clear some patients,Morris.

04:39.630 --> 04:42.070
This is the big leagues,Weaver. The majors.

04:42.070 --> 04:43.410
Take your swing.

04:43.410 --> 04:44.290
Looks pretty bad.

04:44.290 --> 04:47.800
Yeah,she hurt her ankle during dance class.
We're waiting on surgical consult.

04:47.800 --> 04:48.970
Surgical consult?

04:48.970 --> 04:51.540
Yeah. Her fianc?fell on her.

04:51.540 --> 04:55.470

Well,good luck.

04:55.890 --> 04:57.600
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:58.050 --> 04:59.540
You remember Sarah.

04:59.540 --> 05:00.920
Hi,Sarah.

05:00.920 --> 05:02.110
She'll be shadowing me today.

05:02.110 --> 05:04.450
I got your message.
You're going to have fun.

05:04.450 --> 05:05.630
- Where does your belly hurt?
- All over.

05:06.990 --> 05:08.870
Good bowel sounds.

05:08.870 --> 05:10.590
FAST exam was negative.

05:10.590 --> 05:12.100
She doesn't look like a whore.

05:12.100 --> 05:13.400
- Excuse me?
- Sarah...

05:13.400 --> 05:14.900
- Did she just call me a...?
- A whore.

05:14.900 --> 05:16.060
She called you a whore.

05:16.060 --> 05:17.350
No,nobody called you a whore.

05:17.350 --> 05:18.580
- My mom did.
- Sarah...

05:18.580 --> 05:20.340
Well,your mom's mistaken.

05:20.730 --> 05:22.580
- Are you calling my mom a liar?
- You want to go home?

05:23.210 --> 05:25.520
Let's get a CT scan,shall we?

05:27.490 --> 05:29.700
Hey,did you see my infected G
- tube in Three?

05:29.700 --> 05:32.810
I'm about to go and check on him.
That littl||tosser just called me a whore.

05:32.810 --> 05:33.910
She seems so sweet.

05:33.910 --> 05:35.420
I've never been called a whore.

05:35.420 --> 05:37.440
Did she say dirty whore or filthy whore?

05:37.440 --> 05:39.740
- Is there a difference?
- Depends on the whore.

05:39.740 --> 05:41.660
Edgar Dixon,vomited blood,

05:41.660 --> 05:43.200
passed out at the hardware store.

05:43.200 --> 05:44.580
Pressure was 80 palp.

05:44.580 --> 05:46.770
Type and cross four and call for 0-neg.

05:46.770 --> 05:48.310
Pulse is 105.

05:48.310 --> 05:50.620
- Did you call my wife?
- Sir,be still.

05:50.620 --> 05:52.670
It's Thursday... she's at the hairdresser.

05:52.670 --> 05:53.970
We called her. She's on her way.

05:53.970 --> 05:55.320
First bag is in.

05:55.320 --> 05:56.430
Hemocue's 12.4.

05:56.430 --> 05:59.730
Okay,forget the 0-neg.
20 of IV famotidine,10 of reglan.

05:59.730 --> 06:01.550
Another liter of saline wide open.

06:01.550 --> 06:02.990
Sir,have you had any belly pain?

06:02.990 --> 06:04.530
I felt nauseous today.

06:04.530 --> 06:06.430
- Ever had an ulcer?
- No.

06:06.430 --> 06:07.810
Drink much alcohol?

06:07.810 --> 06:09.320
- Not a drop.
- Belly is benign.

06:09.320 --> 06:10.810
Who's your doctor?

06:11.100 --> 06:12.710
I don't really have one.

06:12.710 --> 06:14.390
Are you on any medication?

06:15.260 --> 06:17.600
Something from the drug store for arthritis.

06:17.600 --> 06:19.930
Ibuprofen? Naproxen?

06:19.930 --> 06:20.880
I don't know.

06:20.880 --> 06:23.710
Some arthritis medicines can cause an ulcer.

06:23.710 --> 06:24.930
Is that serious?

06:24.930 --> 06:25.890
If it keeps bleeding it could be.

06:25.890 --> 06:27.380
- Hey,Sam.
- What's up?

06:27.380 --> 06:29.210
- You have a guest.
- Go ahead.

06:31.660 --> 06:34.450
Says she's family.
Drove all the way from Dallas.

06:34.860 --> 06:37.260
Oh,no.
Thank you,Haleh.

06:41.890 --> 06:43.210
Grandma?

06:45.420 --> 06:47.550
Don't tell me we're out of compazine again.

06:47.550 --> 06:50.050
Pharmacy is coming to restock.
Try tigan.

06:50.050 --> 06:51.340
Good idea.

06:52.240 --> 06:55.720
Listen,I,uh,I just heard
about your job offer.

06:55.720 --> 06:58.020
Don't worry,I'm not moving to Miami.

06:59.350 --> 07:00.380
You're not considering it?

07:00.380 --> 07:01.960
No,I like it here.

07:01.960 --> 07:04.180
We may have our occasional gunplay,

07:04.180 --> 07:06.030
but at least we're helping people,right?

07:09.540 --> 07:12.450
I don't need to tell you
January is budget month.

07:13.260 --> 07:16.000
They're asking me to,uh...

07:16.000 --> 07:17.480
to make some cuts.

07:17.480 --> 07:19.050
They want me to lose an attending.

07:19.050 --> 07:21.570
Well,maybe you can send Morris to Miami.

07:23.010 --> 07:25.340
Morris' salary won't do it.

07:25.340 --> 07:27.440
I need to cut at least 200 grand.

07:27.440 --> 07:30.440
Well,the only people who
make that much are you and...

07:34.840 --> 07:36.970
You're kidding,right?

07:36.970 --> 07:38.830
Kerry,I had to...

07:39.410 --> 07:41.540
- I need to cut costs.
- You're firing me?

07:41.540 --> 07:44.700
- Since you have this opportunity...
- This is how you tell me?

07:44.700 --> 07:46.610
There's no good way.

07:49.190 --> 07:50.650
It's unbelievable.

07:50.650 --> 07:53.140
Kerry,you've been doing
this for a long time,

07:53.140 --> 07:54.940
and I know it's not for me to say,

07:54.940 --> 07:58.050
but lately it seems like-like
you've had enough,and...

07:58.050 --> 07:58.930
What?!

07:58.930 --> 08:00.830
Most of the time you're
out doing news stories.

08:00.830 --> 08:03.060
I do those stories on my days off.

08:03.060 --> 08:05.430
Excuse me,I need some Unasyn.

08:05.430 --> 08:07.450
I'm sorry,my hands are
tied. I'm just trying to...

08:07.450 --> 08:09.090
To do what?

08:09.090 --> 08:12.240
To do the right thing or do the easy thing?

08:13.300 --> 08:14.860
Kerry,I'm not happy about this.

08:14.860 --> 08:17.300
You know what,when they
were going to fire you,

08:17.300 --> 08:20.380
I stepped up,I took the fall.

08:20.380 --> 08:22.640
That's the only reason I
ended up back in the ER.

08:22.640 --> 08:26.040
And that's the only reason
that you're still here.

08:34.919 --> 08:36.400
Blood count's holding at 30,

08:36.400 --> 08:38.760
which means you don't have
any ongoing blood loss.

08:38.760 --> 08:42.240
We were in Atlantic City last weekend,
and he started getting ill then.

08:42.240 --> 08:44.340
I knew he should have gone to the doctor.

08:44.340 --> 08:45.830
Honey,you were right,I know.

08:45.830 --> 08:48.490
Could have an ulcer or a tear in
a small vessel in the esophagus.

08:48.490 --> 08:51.900
We're going to have to admit you,and have a specialist
take a look at your stomach just to make sure.

08:51.900 --> 08:54.390
Do you want to come with me
and fill out some paperwork?

08:54.390 --> 08:56.230
I'll be right back,honey.

08:56.230 --> 08:57.420
I love you.

08:57.420 --> 08:58.890
I love you,too,baby.

08:58.890 --> 09:00.620
This is the first you've heard of it?

09:00.620 --> 09:01.960
He just told me.

09:01.960 --> 09:02.940
Oh,I can't believe this.

09:02.940 --> 09:05.980
- Just let it go,Haleh.
-let what go

09:05.980 --> 09:09.010
Your guy is firing Dr. Weaver.

09:11.960 --> 09:14.210
You know what,Mrs. Dixon,
I'll meet you at that desk over there.

09:14.250 --> 09:15.200
Okay.

09:15.200 --> 09:17.390
- He's what?
- Budget cuts.

09:17.390 --> 09:19.460
I don't care if you have another job offer.

09:19.460 --> 09:21.990
You're the best damn attending
in this place.

09:21.990 --> 09:24.400
- What do you mean another job offer?
- In Miami.

09:24.400 --> 09:26.080
Plain films on Yvonne's foot.

09:26.080 --> 09:27.160
Kerry...

09:27.160 --> 09:28.610
Oh,man.

09:28.610 --> 09:29.600
What's going on?

09:29.600 --> 09:32.740
This is bad.
I've got to deal with this,guys.

09:37.360 --> 09:39.870
I know. I'll talk to him.

09:41.650 --> 09:44.600
Um,I looked at your X-ray.

09:44.600 --> 09:48.800
And turns out you have an infection in
the bones of your second and third toes.

09:48.800 --> 09:51.350
Osteomyelitis,
what else is new?

09:51.350 --> 09:53.130
You knew about this?

09:53.130 --> 09:56.710
I cut my foot. The clindamycin
is supposed to clear it all up.

09:56.920 --> 10:01.040
Well,it isn't working, and based on
your increased pain,it's getting worse.

10:01.040 --> 10:02.880
So I give the antibiotics a few more weeks.

10:02.880 --> 10:06.030
Your diabetes has decreased
the blood supply to your toes,

10:06.030 --> 10:08.100
so the antibiotics aren't working.

10:08.100 --> 10:09.610
What are you saying?

10:09.610 --> 10:11.770
Surgery's your only chance for a cure.

10:11.770 --> 10:13.390
Surgery?

10:13.390 --> 10:15.300
Partial amputation.

10:15.300 --> 10:17.710
You want permission to cut off my foot?

10:17.710 --> 10:20.640
Not your whole foot,but two toes.

10:20.850 --> 10:22.380
No.

10:22.380 --> 10:28.050
Look,if you don't do this, the
infection could spread and you could die.

10:28.050 --> 10:29.780
I'll take my chances.

10:29.780 --> 10:31.720
Mrs. Davillere?

10:33.700 --> 10:35.790
I am walking out of here

10:35.790 --> 10:37.580
on both feet.

10:39.370 --> 10:41.300
Get out of my way!

10:42.280 --> 10:44.340
They just kicked you out
of the retirement home?

10:44.340 --> 10:46.550
Nobody cares about the elderly.

10:46.550 --> 10:48.380
Did you get in a fight with your boyfriend?

10:49.420 --> 10:51.160
Which one?

10:52.340 --> 10:55.630
It was a horticultural infraction.

10:55.630 --> 10:56.830
A what?

10:56.830 --> 10:58.710
They didn't like my garden.

10:58.710 --> 10:59.990
Why?

11:01.130 --> 11:03.110
What were you planting?

11:03.110 --> 11:04.970
The usual.

11:04.970 --> 11:06.280
Lavender,basil...

11:06.280 --> 11:07.310
Grandma...

11:07.310 --> 11:09.320
Maybe a little cannabis.

11:09.320 --> 11:11.740
- You were growing weed?
- It's medicinal.

11:11.740 --> 11:13.400
You don't have glaucoma.

11:13.400 --> 11:15.260
Guess why,sweetie.

11:15.460 --> 11:17.860
I can't believe you.
You're 75 years old.

11:17.860 --> 11:20.010
You're lucky they didn't throw you in jail.

11:20.610 --> 11:22.920
Then I could visit your mother.

11:23.960 --> 11:25.810
She gets out next week.

11:25.810 --> 11:28.420
Identity theft.
It's a victimless crime.

11:28.420 --> 11:30.200
No,it's not.

11:33.910 --> 11:35.780
You're right.

11:37.520 --> 11:40.320
Well,she married
this nice electrician.

11:40.320 --> 11:43.580
Sweet Mexican guy. Pablo.

11:43.580 --> 11:46.220
Well,maybe fifth time's the charm.

11:46.800 --> 11:51.580
Look,Sam,I know we have
drama,but we're family.

11:53.280 --> 11:55.900
How long you staying,Gracie?

11:56.120 --> 11:59.230
Just till you throw me
out. Not a bit longer.

12:01.200 --> 12:05.310
Okay,Mr. Richmond,we'll see you next week
for your suture removal.

12:11.770 --> 12:13.360
You're still here.

12:14.460 --> 12:15.910
Bus is slow.

12:15.910 --> 12:19.030
Oh. Thought maybe you were
having second thoughts.

12:22.360 --> 12:25.760
I know this is a difficult decision,
but the surgery doesn't have...

12:25.760 --> 12:29.270
I'm tired of losing things.

12:30.440 --> 12:34.180
I've lost my husband,my house,

12:34.570 --> 12:37.360
the city where I grew up in.

12:37.910 --> 12:40.090
Damn storm took it all.

12:40.090 --> 12:42.320
You're from New Orleans?

12:42.900 --> 12:45.900
Couldn't tell from my bright
smile and stunning glow?

12:48.420 --> 12:50.390
Is that how you got injured?

12:53.390 --> 12:56.030
Everybody begged us to leave,

12:56.030 --> 12:59.980
but we thought it would pass over like Ivan

12:59.980 --> 13:02.730
and all the other ones before that.

13:04.560 --> 13:07.190
When it finally hit,

13:07.190 --> 13:09.390
my husband Duane and I went up to the attic

13:09.390 --> 13:11.680
and broke through the roof.

13:12.430 --> 13:15.910
A boat finally got us
and took us to the 610 overpass.

13:16.340 --> 13:18.840
That's when I realized my foot was cut.

13:18.840 --> 13:21.530
Something in the
floodwaters must have hit it.

13:25.550 --> 13:28.160
It's surgery,it's scary,

13:28.160 --> 13:30.600
but you don't have to die from this.

13:32.550 --> 13:35.120
Too many tough choices.

13:36.340 --> 13:38.520
I'm afraid to make the wrong decision.

13:38.520 --> 13:41.450
Then let me help you make the right one.

13:43.000 --> 13:49.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

14:09.080 --> 14:10.770
Will you trust me?

14:13.380 --> 14:15.540
*********

14:21.640 --> 14:23.410
u never said it was Weaver.

14:23.810 --> 14:24.780
You have to fight for her.

14:24.780 --> 14:26.460
I did,but sometimes
I have to make tough decisions.

14:26.460 --> 14:28.470
- Why didn't you tell me?
- It's not your concern.

14:28.470 --> 14:30.180
That is,like,your mantra lately.

14:30.180 --> 14:31.660
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Never mind. Look.

14:31.660 --> 14:33.510
She's one of the best doctors on the floor.

14:33.510 --> 14:36.960
I know that,but she's also
one of the most expensive. Look.

14:36.960 --> 14:39.650
This is the job,and I don't
like it any more than you do.

14:40.170 --> 14:42.220
84-year-old with shingles.

14:45.230 --> 14:46.850
Stop it,you freak!

14:46.850 --> 14:49.940
Lenny Rivers,got punched
by a passerby,fell on his tailbone.

14:51.150 --> 14:51.860
Okay.

14:51.860 --> 14:54.060
Analgesics,doughnut pillow,and discharge.

14:54.060 --> 14:55.720
Whoa,whoa,whoa. What about X-rays?

14:55.720 --> 14:57.410
I got to file for a disability claim.

14:57.410 --> 14:58.740
You're not supposed to talk.

14:58.740 --> 15:00.430
Okay. Go ahead and order the films.

15:00.430 --> 15:01.560
Haleh,can I get a percocet?

15:01.560 --> 15:03.870
Yeah,but you may need to be patient.

15:04.570 --> 15:06.130
GI lab can take him at 4:00.

15:06.130 --> 15:08.250
Okay. Let's send off a repeat CBC.

15:08.250 --> 15:10.270
Ben,you got the narcotics keys?

15:10.270 --> 15:12.990
Oh. My bad. I meant to
leave them on the admin desk.

15:14.520 --> 15:16.520
Pressure's down to 70 systolic!

15:16.520 --> 15:17.680
- Open up the saline.
- Okay,okay.

15:17.680 --> 15:18.800
Put him in Trendelenberg.

15:18.800 --> 15:21.190
Two units of packed cells,
and let's get Pratt in here.

15:21.190 --> 15:22.380
He's going to need a second line.

15:22.380 --> 15:24.320
Yeah. Intubation tray.

15:28.030 --> 15:29.820
Dawn's from New Orleans,too.

15:29.820 --> 15:30.670
What part?

15:30.670 --> 15:32.640
Seventh ward,by the Florida Canal.

15:32.640 --> 15:34.870
I used to work at Charity. What about you?

15:34.870 --> 15:36.830
Ninth. Over near Jackson Barracks.

15:36.830 --> 15:38.530
I was born at Charity.

15:38.530 --> 15:39.580
You need to sign here,too.

15:39.580 --> 15:41.150
You been back?

15:41.150 --> 15:43.010
I'm not ready.

15:43.690 --> 15:45.010
Are you sure I need this?

15:45.010 --> 15:48.720
Oh,yeah. The infection's deep into the bone
of the second and third toe.

15:48.720 --> 15:51.750
Removing them is the only
way to prevent spread.

15:51.750 --> 15:53.190
How long have you been a surgeon?

15:53.190 --> 15:56.300
Um... almost 15 years.

15:56.300 --> 15:58.670
Dr. Dubenko's one of our best.

15:59.300 --> 16:01.450
How many surgeries have you done?

16:01.830 --> 16:03.480
10,000.

16:03.480 --> 16:05.530
What about toes? How many toes?

16:05.530 --> 16:07.370
- I've done a lot of toes.
- He's good.

16:08.030 --> 16:09.140
You been working all night?

16:09.140 --> 16:10.050
I beg your pardon?

16:10.050 --> 16:11.230
You seem a little tired.

16:11.230 --> 16:13.890
No,no,I'm fine.
I actually slept in my own bed last night.

16:13.890 --> 16:15.430
You have nothing to worry about.

16:15.430 --> 16:18.310
Can we have one of those mirrors
so I can watch my operation?

16:18.310 --> 16:20.990
Oh,no,no,. You're going to be fast asleep.

16:20.990 --> 16:22.800
Dr. Weaver said I didn't have to go under.

16:22.800 --> 16:24.680
Oh,really? Is that what Dr. Weaver said?

16:24.680 --> 16:27.420
Just give us a sec.

16:32.820 --> 16:34.940
Why in the world would you tell her
that she could be awake?

16:34.940 --> 16:38.260
Look,she barely agreed to the surgery.
Just... just give her an epidural.

16:38.260 --> 16:39.720
The anesthesia is better with a general.

16:39.720 --> 16:41.890
She's afraid of the dark.
She's a Katrina victim.

16:41.890 --> 16:44.780
My heart goes out to her,but
an epidural can drop her BP.

16:44.780 --> 16:46.990
Look,general anesthesia isn't risk-free.

16:46.990 --> 16:47.820
It's more efficient.

16:47.820 --> 16:49.420
Okay,cut the crap,Lucien.

16:49.420 --> 16:53.280
You don't want her awake because you
don't want to answer a bunch of questions.

16:53.280 --> 16:54.590
I'll go up with her.

16:54.590 --> 16:57.370
I'll handle her. She won't get in your way.

16:57.940 --> 16:59.050
Okay.

17:00.400 --> 17:01.470
Second unit is in.

17:01.470 --> 17:02.680
Yeah? Well,hang a third.

17:02.680 --> 17:04.599
Sats are up to 90. Call for a vent.

17:04.599 --> 17:06.400
Already did. Somebody
better get his wife in here.

17:06.400 --> 17:07.579
Come on. Talk to me,Ray.

17:07.579 --> 17:09.730
Upper GI bleed. Systolic of 60.

17:09.730 --> 17:11.270
Second IV is in. Ready for blood.

17:11.270 --> 17:12.650
All right. Has he had ulcers before?

17:12.650 --> 17:14.250
We couldn't get a good history.

17:14.250 --> 17:15.910
I think I know this guy.
Wasn't he in here last week?

17:15.910 --> 17:17.530
No. First time to County.

17:17.530 --> 17:19.230
Wait a minute. How long has he been here?

17:19.230 --> 17:20.079
About an hour and a half.

17:20.079 --> 17:21.380
And he's just getting a second IV?

17:21.380 --> 17:22.280
We thought he was stable.

17:22.280 --> 17:23.619
No GI bleed is stable.

17:23.619 --> 17:25.430
Hematemesis only once,crit was over 30.

17:25.430 --> 17:28.400
The guy needed aggressive therapy.
Why wasn't an attending involved?

17:28.400 --> 17:30.820
- Abby and I both agreed...
- You're both residents,Ray!

17:30.820 --> 17:32.040
Get Abby in here right now.

17:32.040 --> 17:35.070
Call the blood bank,stay
ahead four units,and get FFP.

17:35.380 --> 17:36.610
I'll fire up the rapid infuser.

17:36.610 --> 17:38.800
You should have anticipated this.

17:41.050 --> 17:42.220
How long will the surgery take?

17:42.220 --> 17:43.230
About two hours.

17:43.230 --> 17:46.040
Can you come sign off out marshmallow girl
so she can get out of here?

17:46.040 --> 17:47.510
Lucien,I'll be up in a minute.

17:47.510 --> 17:49.230
I know you will,Kerry.

17:49.230 --> 17:51.330
What's his problem?

17:51.330 --> 17:54.860
Aw. Control freak. You okay?

17:54.860 --> 17:56.720
It's kind of hard seeing
folks from back home.

17:56.720 --> 17:57.910
Your whole family come up?

17:57.910 --> 18:00.290
- My aunt let eight of us move in.
- Eight? Wow.

18:00.290 --> 18:01.440
That must be hard.

18:01.440 --> 18:04.150
Some moved back to make sure
their houses weren't seized.

18:04.150 --> 18:05.700
The rest never want to go back.

18:05.700 --> 18:07.820
There's no way that that's me!

18:07.820 --> 18:10.610
Well,where did you ship two iBooks to?

18:11.160 --> 18:12.860
See? I don't even live there!

18:12.860 --> 18:14.910
Is he still trying to work
out his credit problems?

18:14.910 --> 18:16.930
Mine took years.

18:16.930 --> 18:18.860
Come on. Go ahead,Gracie.

18:18.860 --> 18:21.120
It says you're going to live a long time.

18:21.120 --> 18:23.040
My family lives well into their 90s.

18:23.040 --> 18:25.530
Come on,now. Look in there
and tell me something I don't know.

18:25.530 --> 18:27.900
Well,it says you're
going to be very wealthy.

18:27.900 --> 18:29.170
That's what I'm talking about.

18:29.170 --> 18:33.030
Hey,Sam,Curtain Three needs bilateral
leg ultrasounds to rule out DVT.

18:33.030 --> 18:35.750
Okay. Come on,Gracie. I'll
put you in the break room.

18:38.340 --> 18:40.020
Hey,Gracie?

18:40.020 --> 18:41.640
Am I going to have good luck?

18:41.640 --> 18:44.150
We'll see.
Call me at 8:00.

18:46.660 --> 18:48.130
I love that woman.

18:48.960 --> 18:51.040
He's not even your type,Grandma.

18:51.040 --> 18:54.080
You know what they say: Once you go black...

18:54.080 --> 18:55.660
Grandma!

18:56.800 --> 18:58.430
You still living at the same place?

18:58.860 --> 19:01.460
We were living at this house
while I was working part-time,

19:01.460 --> 19:03.740
but it wasn't really the
best environment for Alex,

19:03.740 --> 19:05.890
so we just moved.

19:05.890 --> 19:07.600
Is he still playing soccer?

19:07.600 --> 19:09.570
Uh-huh. Indoor now.

19:09.570 --> 19:11.280
He's the best left wing on the team.

19:11.280 --> 19:13.100
How are his grades?

19:13.100 --> 19:15.890
A's and B's. He's doing amazing.

19:15.890 --> 19:18.590
Sweetie,that's great. I'm proud of him.

19:18.830 --> 19:20.220
Of both of you.

19:20.220 --> 19:22.970
Thanks,Grandma.
That means a lot to me.

19:23.490 --> 19:25.250
How's my Xbox 360?

19:25.250 --> 19:26.230
What are you talking about?

19:26.230 --> 19:28.350
Your little clepto of a son is now a felon.

19:28.350 --> 19:29.930
He stole my credit card number,

19:29.930 --> 19:32.590
and has been having
stuff sent to your house.

19:33.040 --> 19:33.990
Are you kidding me?

19:33.990 --> 19:38.540
Do I look like the last comic standing? I
bet you that necklace you have on is mine,too.

19:40.750 --> 19:43.300
- Amp of epi is in.
- No,he needs volume,not epi.

19:43.300 --> 19:44.540
Edgar?

19:44.540 --> 19:46.820
What's wrong with him?
What's going on?

19:46.820 --> 19:48.280
Six units in so far.

19:48.280 --> 19:49.530
Getting harder to bag.

19:49.530 --> 19:52.010
I just went to the cafeteria.
They said he was fine.

19:52.010 --> 19:53.840
He's in pulmonary edema
from the transfusions.

19:53.840 --> 19:55.800
What's going on?
He was stable when I saw him.

19:55.800 --> 19:57.680
Your husband doesn't have a doctor,ma'am?

19:57.680 --> 19:59.330
Not a regular one. Is he going to be okay?

20:00.410 --> 20:02.040
So,what?No past history?  No meds?

20:02.040 --> 20:05.960
No. Renuvium. He's on Renuvium. Mrs. Dixon
called home,her son read the name off the bottle.

20:05.960 --> 20:07.140
Where the hell would he get Renuvium?

20:07.140 --> 20:09.880
Some church clinic on the south side.

20:09.880 --> 20:11.070
What church?

20:11.430 --> 20:13.600
First Mission Baptist on Calumet.

20:13.600 --> 20:15.090
What? Do they have a doctor there?

20:15.090 --> 20:17.860
I don't know. I wasn't with him.

20:22.440 --> 20:23.770
Units 11 and 12 are running.

20:24.730 --> 20:25.990
All right. Run the platelets through here.

20:25.990 --> 20:27.960
- Should we try more volume?
- Maybe GI can scope him.

20:27.960 --> 20:29.360
Not without a pulse or BP.

20:29.360 --> 20:30.380
All right. What's our rhythm?

20:30.380 --> 20:33.530
- Asystole.
- Edgar,honey,please! Please be okay!

20:33.530 --> 20:35.470
Get another four units! Push another epi!

20:35.470 --> 20:37.000
He's already had five rounds of meds.

20:37.000 --> 20:38.990
- Should we try an intraaortic balloon?
- Too late for that.

20:38.990 --> 20:41.650
Let's check a hemocue,PT,PTT,
see where we are.

20:42.260 --> 20:43.840
Pratt. Pratt. It's time to stop.

20:43.930 --> 20:46.540
- NO
- No! Don't you stop!

20:46.540 --> 20:49.310
- This is a reversible condition.
- Not anymore.

20:50.770 --> 20:53.290
42 minutes. We're not going to get him back.

20:53.740 --> 20:55.570
Greg,you know she's right,okay?

20:56.010 --> 20:57.680
Nobody's called it yet.

20:57.970 --> 21:00.780
Please! Please keep going.
Please.

21:11.340 --> 21:13.330
Time of death 1648.

21:13.330 --> 21:15.040
No!

21:18.590 --> 21:20.450
Oh,darling!

21:29.810 --> 21:30.790
I won't feel anything?

21:30.790 --> 21:32.450
Not with the spinal anesthetic.

21:32.450 --> 21:34.440
Especially since it's me who placed it.

21:34.440 --> 21:35.950
Do you want pulse lavage?

21:35.950 --> 21:38.930
Three liters,with
polymyxin,all in one bag,please.

21:38.930 --> 21:42.300
I was in New Orleans once.
I became addicted to beignets.

21:42.300 --> 21:44.800
Cafe Dumonde's my favorite spot.

21:44.800 --> 21:46.900
- Where you from?
- London.

21:46.900 --> 21:49.650
Really?
I spent a year in college there.

21:49.650 --> 21:50.750
Power set up?

21:50.750 --> 21:52.690
Micro-E set with sagittal saw.

21:52.690 --> 21:55.000
They're prepping to get
rid of the diseased bone.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.970
Are you still planning to scrub in
on the robotic prostatectomy next door?

21:57.970 --> 22:00.360
I certainly am. As soon as we finish here.

22:00.780 --> 22:03.200
You should check out this new machine,Kerry.

22:03.200 --> 22:04.080
It's unbelievable.

22:04.080 --> 22:07.190
Ensures perfect nerve-sparing technology

22:07.190 --> 22:10.540
all for the low,low price
of $1.5 million.

22:10.770 --> 22:12.420
The budget committee approved that?

22:12.420 --> 22:14.720
Yeah. They finally cut us a break this year.

22:14.720 --> 22:16.030
Culture tubes?

22:16.030 --> 22:17.710
Aerobic and anaerobic,please.

22:17.710 --> 22:19.150
Infusing.

22:19.150 --> 22:21.200
Bovie.

22:21.200 --> 22:23.200
Good. Now...

22:23.200 --> 22:25.690
isolate the neurovascular bundle.

22:26.190 --> 22:27.360
What does that mean?

22:27.360 --> 22:30.020
They're protecting the nerves and arteries.

22:30.020 --> 22:32.100
BP 80 systolic.

22:32.100 --> 22:33.370
What's happening?

22:33.370 --> 22:35.310
One liter saline bolus,and
get her head down.

22:35.310 --> 22:37.490
Is this a reaction to the spinal?

22:37.490 --> 22:39.790
Don't think so
- BP dropped after the antibiotic.

22:39.790 --> 22:40.700
Anaphylaxis?

22:40.700 --> 22:42.850
Could be an allergy to penicillin.

22:42.850 --> 22:45.430
Sats are dropping,88%.

22:48.320 --> 22:50.260
What did we do?

22:50.790 --> 22:54.430
I must have seen 300 or
400 patients at that church.

22:55.910 --> 22:58.250
Didn't remember the guy.

22:59.510 --> 23:01.530
Is this our fault?

23:01.530 --> 23:03.210
Couldn't this have happened

23:03.210 --> 23:06.210
if he got the drug through
a regular prescription?

23:07.930 --> 23:09.440
I don't know.

23:20.040 --> 23:21.890
I have to go talk to her.

23:23.250 --> 23:26.020
You're gonna tell her that
we're the ones from the church?

23:26.020 --> 23:28.250
I'm not gonna bring you into it.

23:29.150 --> 23:31.970
But I'll let her know I was
the one running the clinic.

23:41.870 --> 23:45.160
Yvonne,we're gonna sedate you
and place a tube to help you breathe.

23:45.160 --> 23:46.470
No,I'm not going under.

23:46.470 --> 23:47.840
Etomidate's going in.

23:47.840 --> 23:49.220
Honey,you're not getting enough oxygen.

23:49.220 --> 23:50.070
No.

23:50.070 --> 23:52.300
When they left me on that bridge,

23:52.300 --> 23:54.580
- I woke up in the darkness...
- Listen,Yvonne...

23:56.570 --> 23:58.230
Sats only 81.

24:00.820 --> 24:01.690
What are you doing,Kerry?

24:01.690 --> 24:04.120
I'm getting IV epinephrine.
She's anaphylaxing.

24:04.120 --> 24:05.390
I can hear the wheezing from here.

24:05.390 --> 24:06.880
Ari can manage an airway.

24:06.880 --> 24:09.910
No. Her hypoxia's worsening. She needs this.

24:09.910 --> 24:10.850
Hard to bag.

24:10.850 --> 24:13.350
We only ever give IV epi
for a full arrest,Kerry.

24:13.350 --> 24:15.000
Well,then you're about
to learn something new.

24:15.000 --> 24:16.560
Are you kidding me?

24:16.560 --> 24:17.630
Dr. Weaver,stop.

24:17.630 --> 24:20.230
Pushing two cc's,one to 10,000.

24:20.230 --> 24:22.510
This should buy you some time
to do a controlled intubation.

24:22.510 --> 24:24.390
Kerry,with all due respect,this is my O.R.

24:24.390 --> 24:27.650
I don't care about your O.R.
I lost my job to pay for your robot.

24:27.650 --> 24:29.500
I care about this patient.

24:29.500 --> 24:31.710
Easier to bag.
Heart rate's coming down.

24:31.710 --> 24:33.720
Sats up to 95. Go for it,Ari.

24:33.720 --> 24:35.080
Looks like the epi worked.

24:35.080 --> 24:37.340
You just got very lucky,Dr. Weaver.

24:37.780 --> 24:40.300
None of this looks like healthy tissue.

24:40.550 --> 24:42.700
You're absolutely right.
It's into the tarsals.

24:42.700 --> 24:44.580
So what are we gonna do?

24:44.580 --> 24:45.880
She needs a BKA.

24:45.880 --> 24:48.860
No,wait,wait,wait,you're not
gonna amputate below the knee.

24:48.860 --> 24:51.700
Lucien,I-I promised her that
she wouldn't lose the foot.

24:51.700 --> 24:53.090
The MRI was fine.

24:53.090 --> 24:54.590
The MRI was three weeks old.

24:54.590 --> 24:57.580
And apparently,it's progressed.
Prep for BKA. Let's move the drapes.

24:57.580 --> 25:00.810
No,can't you just take the
toes and give her six weeks...

25:00.810 --> 25:03.990
She's diabetic with vascular
disease,Kerry,okay? She'd never heal.

25:03.990 --> 25:05.950
Get me the Zimmer saw.

25:07.620 --> 25:08.780
I love Italian food.

25:08.780 --> 25:13.000
When I was in Venice,they had this tight little
joint had the best fettuccini you ever tasted.

25:13.000 --> 25:16.360
Well,there's no gnocchi like my gnocchi.

25:16.360 --> 25:18.740
So,maybe we can go to
the movies this Saturday.

25:18.740 --> 25:20.600
There's a really cool space movie.

25:20.600 --> 25:22.080
But it's supposed to be good for adults,too.

25:22.080 --> 25:23.110
I'll see if I'm working.

25:23.110 --> 25:24.930
You're not.
I just made the schedule.

25:24.930 --> 25:26.780
Cool. Then it's a date.

25:31.980 --> 25:33.790
Grandma?

25:34.550 --> 25:37.220
Hi,Alex!
Look at you!

25:37.220 --> 25:38.350
So grown up.

25:38.350 --> 25:41.400
Hey! Hey,come here,
you little Artful Dodger!

25:42.220 --> 25:44.690
- Alex,what the hell is going on?
- What?

25:44.690 --> 25:47.440
- Did you steal from Dr. Morris?
- No. Why?

25:47.440 --> 25:49.420
Where'd you get your Xbox from?

25:49.420 --> 25:52.750
Well,um... uh,Mr. Elliott bought it for me.

25:52.750 --> 25:54.280
Did he buy me this necklace,too?

25:54.280 --> 25:56.150
No. I bought you that necklace.

25:57.050 --> 25:59.170
Alex,you come here.

25:59.170 --> 26:00.420
What?

26:00.420 --> 26:03.850
Now,don't give me any attitude,Mr. Man.

26:04.600 --> 26:07.220
If this was 20 years ago,I
could knock you back to China

26:07.220 --> 26:09.320
and not have Social
Services on me,but it's not.

26:09.320 --> 26:12.990
So I'm gonna ask you
one time and one time only,

26:12.990 --> 26:17.040
did you steal Dr. Morris's credit card?
Yes or no?

26:17.600 --> 26:19.700
Gracie,just...

26:20.650 --> 26:21.890
I,um...

26:21.890 --> 26:25.800
No,don't stammer,don't stutter.
And look me in the eye.

26:27.780 --> 26:31.610
Did you or did you not
steal his credit card?

26:33.440 --> 26:34.450
I'm sorry,okay?

26:34.450 --> 26:38.360
No,don't you say sorry to me,you say sorry
to Dr. Morris.

26:38.360 --> 26:39.930
You know better!

26:39.930 --> 26:43.340
I'm sorry,Dr. Morris,for
stealing your credit card.

26:43.340 --> 26:45.600
Well,all right.

26:45.600 --> 26:47.520
We'll figure it out.

26:47.520 --> 26:49.360
You can start paying
me back in installments.

26:49.360 --> 26:50.730
That's fine.

26:50.730 --> 26:53.900
Alex,why would you do that?

26:55.420 --> 26:59.000
Hey! No,you... you work and I'll get him.

27:00.230 --> 27:03.920
Hey,Nelson Wilcox,39,vomiting
and abdominal pain.

27:03.920 --> 27:06.590
Hypotensive after a liter. Sam! We need you.

27:06.590 --> 27:08.570
Dr. Morris,I don't even know what to say.

27:08.570 --> 27:09.840
What about my necklace?

27:09.840 --> 27:12.450
- Vitals?
- 92/58. Pulse is 97.

27:12.450 --> 27:14.960
- I'm Dr. Kovac. Where does it hurt?
- My stomach.

27:14.960 --> 27:17.780
We were getting fitted for snow board
boots; he started feeling queasy.

27:17.780 --> 27:20.270
'Kay,let's get him on a
monitor and start a second line.

27:20.270 --> 27:22.180
He's got chronic
pancreatitis from gallstones.

27:22.180 --> 27:24.230
He's supposed to have surgery next month.

27:24.620 --> 27:28.060
CBC,Chem 7,LFT's,lipase and calcium.

27:28.060 --> 27:31.220
He's been feeling good,
so we planned this trip to the Rockies.

27:31.220 --> 27:32.580
Call my dad.

27:32.580 --> 27:35.870
He turns 40 in February.
We got 15 people coming.

27:35.870 --> 27:38.150
Don't forget a d-stick.
Check for hyperglycemia.

27:38.150 --> 27:39.940
He's gonna be all right,isn't he?

27:39.940 --> 27:41.250
Systolic's down to 78.

27:41.250 --> 27:43.030
All right,another liter,wide open.

27:43.030 --> 27:46.460
Hold on  lungs are wet. He's either
in failure or he's thirdspacing.

27:46.460 --> 27:48.460
Yes,well,either way
he's hypotensive- he needs volume.

27:48.460 --> 27:50.290
You want to try albumin,25%?

27:50.290 --> 27:52.070
- No. That won't work.

27:52.070 --> 27:53.500
IV's blown,and his veins are crap.

27:53.500 --> 27:56.680
All right,sterile sixes and coitus to me
- I'm gonna throw in a subclavian.

27:56.680 --> 27:59.320
H   He ate this huge
plate of waffles yesterday.

27:59.320 --> 28:00.720
I mean,I told him not to do it.

28:00.720 --> 28:02.040
Abdomen's tense.

28:02.040 --> 28:03.720
All right,I'll get the
ultrasound and call for surgery.

28:03.720 --> 28:05.390
Wait,we don't even know
what we're dealing with yet.

28:05.390 --> 28:06.820
I think we have a pretty good idea.

28:06.820 --> 28:10.810
Even if it is acute pancreatitis, first-line
management is supportive care,not surgery.

28:10.810 --> 28:12.490
They need to be involved.

28:16.850 --> 28:18.050
Got a flash.

28:18.050 --> 28:19.540
Sats dropping,82.

28:19.540 --> 28:21.030
Mr. Wilcox?

28:22.190 --> 28:23.840
Mr. Wilcox?

28:29.570 --> 28:31.320
You told her you were
the doctor at the church?

28:31.320 --> 28:33.520
And that I prescribed the Renuvium.

28:33.940 --> 28:36.260
And she's okay with that,or...?

28:36.260 --> 28:37.870
Well,she understands it was a mistake.

28:37.870 --> 28:40.030
and she's trying to digest what's happened.

28:40.030 --> 28:41.410
You've got to talk to Pastor Watkins.

28:42.090 --> 28:43.690
Oh,yeah,we're shutting it down.

28:43.690 --> 28:45.000
Yeah.

28:45.000 --> 28:48.070
I can't leave my post. Yeah. You're gonna
have to page Dr. Gates from the desk!

28:48.070 --> 28:48.970
Oh,come on,

28:48.970 --> 28:51.160
- there's,like,50 people over there.
- I don't care...

28:51.160 --> 28:51.860
It's okay,Jim,it's okay.

28:52.340 --> 28:53.480
Well,I didn't know you
were coming down here.

28:53.480 --> 28:55.010
I was in the neighborhood.

28:55.010 --> 28:56.870
Wanted to see how she was doing.

28:56.870 --> 28:57.980
You having fun,huh?

28:57.980 --> 29:02.610
Yeah,it's been great  we treated this
mime guy,and a lady who broke her ankle.

29:02.610 --> 29:04.340
Oh,cool,babe.

29:04.700 --> 29:06.530
So this is where you work,huh?

29:06.530 --> 29:08.100
Yeah,this is it.

29:08.720 --> 29:11.110
You want to see the trauma rooms?
They're right back there.

29:11.110 --> 29:12.260
Yeah. Come on.

29:12.350 --> 29:13.750
- Is your little girlfriend there?
- Meg.

29:13.750 --> 29:15.970
Or is she out buying IKEA furniture?

29:15.970 --> 29:17.630
You know what,we're not
gonna do this right now.

29:17.630 --> 29:19.830
Oh,no,now is the perfect time.

29:19.830 --> 29:21.660
Mom,let me show you the break room,

29:21.660 --> 29:23.100
- No,Sarah...
- so Tony can get back to work.

29:23.100 --> 29:24.960
Tony has to clear a few things up.

29:24.960 --> 29:26.250
You're drunk.

29:26.250 --> 29:28.170
You were gonna walk out

29:28.170 --> 29:30.710
and move in with that little bitch?

29:30.970 --> 29:32.480
- Meg...
- You're a liar.

29:32.480 --> 29:35.640
Sarah,he's done nothing but lie to us
- that's all he ever does is lie.

29:35.640 --> 29:37.320
Mom,don't.

29:37.620 --> 29:39.210
Oh,speak of the bitch...

29:39.210 --> 29:40.740
- Don't walk away from me!
- Meg...

29:40.740 --> 29:42.060
No,you need to hear this.

29:42.060 --> 29:43.540
No,I don't think I do.

29:43.540 --> 29:44.810
Mom,stop it!

29:44.810 --> 29:46.680
- I did everything for him!
- All right,Meg.

29:46.680 --> 29:48.030
- I straightened him out
- Meg...

29:48.030 --> 29:50.770
when he was a mess,when
he was just a useless vet!

29:50.770 --> 29:55.290
I used my husband's insurance money
to put him through medical school!

29:55.760 --> 29:58.260
You don't get to have him,do you hear me?!

29:58.260 --> 30:00.570
*****

30:10.780 --> 30:11.900
Where's Kovac?

30:11.900 --> 30:13.360
Trauma two.

30:15.100 --> 30:17.380
- Increase the peep.
- I can't - I'll give him a pneumo.

30:17.380 --> 30:18.880
PVCs. 100 of lido.

30:18.880 --> 30:21.570
He's okay,isn't he? I
mean,he's okay!  Isn't he?

30:21.570 --> 30:25.210
His oxygen is low, and it's causing
his heart to beat in an abnormal rhythm.

30:25.210 --> 30:26.720
Pulse ox 78.

30:26.720 --> 30:28.020
He's not dying.

30:28.020 --> 30:31.090
Luka,surgery orders some million-dollar toy

30:31.090 --> 30:33.260
- Not right now,Kerry. am I'm too expensive?
- We need to talk.

30:33.260 --> 30:35.840
- Uh,V-tach.
- No pulse. Starting compressions.

30:35.840 --> 30:37.040
Charging to 200.

30:37.040 --> 30:38.090
What do you got?

30:38.090 --> 30:40.630
Acute pancreatitis,hypotensive
despite six liters.

30:40.630 --> 30:41.730
What's happening?

30:42.280 --> 30:43.590
What's happening?!

30:43.590 --> 30:45.490
- 'Kay,clear.
- Get back,get back.

30:45.490 --> 30:47.800
Will somebody talk to me?!

30:47.800 --> 30:50.630
He's in cardiac arrest,
and you're gonna have to stand back,okay?

30:50.630 --> 30:52.670
Is he bleeding from somewhere?

30:52.670 --> 30:54.710
- His crit's stable.
- Has surgery been here?

30:54.710 --> 30:56.380
They just want to observe in the ICU.

30:56.380 --> 31:00.250
Well,get 'em back in. 18-gauge spinal
needle, connector tubing,and a manometer.

31:00.250 --> 31:01.880
The guy's in arrest
- we don't have time for that.

31:01.880 --> 31:04.710
- What are you doing?
- Checking for abdominal compartment syndrome.

31:04.710 --> 31:07.020
He's got a fatal arrhythmia.
We should focus on the heart. Look,

31:07.020 --> 31:11.060
his BP sucks because the abdominal pressure
is crushing the vena cava.

31:11.060 --> 31:14.370
Can't ventilate,because his belly's
compressing his lungs.

31:14.370 --> 31:16.220
Okay,hold compressions.

31:29.850 --> 31:31.420
42 centimeters.

31:31.420 --> 31:34.440
More than enough to cause end-organ damage.

31:34.810 --> 31:37.000
Okay,resume compressions.
Ten blade.

31:37.000 --> 31:38.920
Ma'am,what's your name?

31:38.920 --> 31:39.830
Marnie.

31:39.830 --> 31:43.720
Your husband's pancreatitis is causing
swelling of all the abdominal organs.

31:43.720 --> 31:45.460
- Another 50 of lido.
- Pushing it.

31:45.460 --> 31:49.220
He doesn't need cardiac meds.
He needs to be decompressed.

31:50.200 --> 31:52.260
Luka,you know I'm right.

31:57.590 --> 31:59.430
Pick-ups,two sets.

32:03.010 --> 32:05.050
Retract superficial layers.

32:05.050 --> 32:06.170
I'm doing CPR.

32:06.170 --> 32:08.330
He won't need it after this.

32:21.020 --> 32:23.280
Back in sinus with a pulse.

32:23.280 --> 32:25.620
Saline and sterile towels.

32:25.620 --> 32:28.320
I've still got a few tricks up my sleeve.

32:35.230 --> 32:37.670
I can't lose you,T.

32:38.900 --> 32:40.750
This ain't just the booze,is it?

32:40.750 --> 32:43.340
You can't walk out on us!
We're your family!

32:43.340 --> 32:47.510
Family?! Meg,what you did out there,
you call that family?! I work here!

32:47.800 --> 32:50.260
You've been avoiding me.
What did you want me to do?

32:50.260 --> 32:52.420
Move on.

32:54.380 --> 32:57.180
You don't love me anymore.

32:57.650 --> 33:00.140
Not the way you want me to.

33:01.830 --> 33:03.080
I'll change!

33:03.080 --> 33:07.030
It's not about that. You can't change.

33:07.800 --> 33:09.520
You'd rather be with that little bitch.

33:09.520 --> 33:11.070
Knock it off.

33:11.590 --> 33:12.740
She has nothing to do with this.

33:12.740 --> 33:14.680
She has everything to do with this.

33:16.590 --> 33:18.970
I'm going to tell you one last time,Meg.

33:18.970 --> 33:21.270
I'm sorry,but it is over.

33:21.890 --> 33:25.710
You don't care about Sarah?

33:27.290 --> 33:28.590
Of course I do.

33:28.590 --> 33:32.280
Well,I mean,do you not
want to see her anymore?

33:35.380 --> 33:36.980
I never said that Meg.

33:36.980 --> 33:39.090
Because...

33:40.770 --> 33:44.760
that's what's going to
happen if you do this.

33:45.180 --> 33:48.180
You would hurt her just to get back at me?

33:49.380 --> 33:51.780
You're a damn liar.

33:51.780 --> 33:53.150
You prick!

33:53.150 --> 33:55.620
- Damn little prick!
- Knock it off.

33:55.620 --> 33:56.850
Listen.

33:57.540 --> 33:58.660
Listen to me,Meg.

33:58.660 --> 34:01.820
There's nothing you could do to keep me
away from Sarah, do you understand that?

34:11.460 --> 34:14.550
It's cold out here.
You should come back in.

34:17.409 --> 34:18.969
I hate her.

34:19.850 --> 34:21.900
You don't mean that.

34:22.520 --> 34:25.170
She's crazy.
That's why Tony's leaving.

34:25.170 --> 34:26.909
He loves you.

34:26.909 --> 34:29.330
You know that won't ever change.

34:31.469 --> 34:33.690
Can I ask you a favor?

34:33.690 --> 34:35.110
Sure.

34:36.980 --> 34:39.219
Find somebody else.

34:39.810 --> 34:40.500
Sorry?

34:40.500 --> 34:42.270
He doesn't love you.

34:42.270 --> 34:44.600
- He's just having sex with you.
- Sarah...

34:44.600 --> 34:46.710
That's what he does.

34:47.570 --> 34:50.380
But he always comes back to us.

35:17.080 --> 35:19.310
When we opened you up,
we learned that the infection had spread.

35:19.310 --> 35:22.140
We had to do the amputation.

35:23.330 --> 35:25.940
I should have never trusted you.

35:27.140 --> 35:31.590
With the new prosthetic legs,
you'll have complete mobility.

35:35.880 --> 35:38.790
Every time I make a choice,it's wrong.

35:38.790 --> 35:41.220
This was the right thing to do.

35:43.900 --> 35:47.740
My husband and I were on that bridge

35:47.740 --> 35:55.180
for 27 hours before a helicopter
came and and took us to the Superdome.

35:57.290 --> 36:03.200
And when the buses
came,there was only one seat.

36:04.640 --> 36:07.650
I didn't want to go,but he insisted.

36:10.200 --> 36:12.520
And I took that seat.

36:14.840 --> 36:17.300
I left him there.

36:17.870 --> 36:22.400
It was about a week later
when I found out he died in that stadium.

36:24.890 --> 36:26.790
It's not your fault.

36:28.040 --> 36:32.200
I know. It's God's.

36:33.510 --> 36:35.380
Why did he do this?

36:35.380 --> 36:38.110
Take it all away?

36:38.110 --> 36:40.910
He didn't take it all.
You're still alive.

36:40.910 --> 36:43.580
You're getting another chance.

36:43.580 --> 36:47.050
For what?
What am I gonna do now?

36:47.960 --> 36:53.110
You're gonna,you're gonna accept this
and you're gonna go on.

36:54.480 --> 36:57.200
Go home,paint.

36:59.240 --> 37:03.480
Find a way to use this gift to make
sure people never forget what happened.

37:09.700 --> 37:11.970
They can't forget.

37:13.180 --> 37:15.260
You won't let them.

37:16.360 --> 37:19.110
Dr. Pratt,arsenic overdose has an ICU bed.

37:19.110 --> 37:21.410
Call Hematology.
He'll need chelation.

37:21.410 --> 37:23.210
Just the man I want to see.

37:23.210 --> 37:25.840
Did you work on a Edgar Dixon today?

37:25.840 --> 37:28.000
Yeah,yeah,yeah. Why,what's up?

37:28.000 --> 37:30.790
He was getting Renuvium illegally.

37:30.790 --> 37:31.690
Yeah,so I heard.

37:31.690 --> 37:36.160
Apparently,First Mission Baptist is
dispensing meds without a pharmacy license.

37:36.160 --> 37:38.580
I'll need his medical records.

37:38.580 --> 37:40.240
Yeah,but the family's not gonna sue.

37:40.240 --> 37:43.500
The records are for the State Medical Board.
There's gonna be an investigation.

37:43.500 --> 37:44.930
Angela,how's it going?

37:44.930 --> 37:46.690
Okay,just following up a record.

37:46.690 --> 37:48.950
I meant you,your daughter. How's Danielle?

37:48.950 --> 37:51.390
She's better,thanks,Luka,

37:51.680 --> 37:53.290
for everything.

37:54.890 --> 37:57.460
Hey,Dr. Kovac,can I
talk to you for a minute?

37:57.460 --> 37:58.880
Yeah.

37:58.880 --> 38:00.590
In private?

38:07.560 --> 38:11.120
- Whoo,this is nice,Sammy.
- Thanks.

38:11.120 --> 38:13.330
You remember when we lived in that trailer?

38:13.330 --> 38:15.830
You guys lived in a trailer?
It was a mobile home.

38:15.830 --> 38:17.890
That's uppity for "trailer. "

38:17.890 --> 38:19.580
- Go unlock the door.
- Sure.

38:21.340 --> 38:22.840
Where you from,Ben?

38:22.840 --> 38:25.290
I'm from Georgia.
A little town called Richmond Hill.

38:25.290 --> 38:28.050
I had a boyfriend once
in Chatham. He dumped me.

38:28.050 --> 38:29.540
I swear it was for his sister.

38:29.540 --> 38:32.540
Grandma has lots of stories
about her antics with men.

38:33.010 --> 38:35.360
Oh. I'm not scaring you,am I?

38:35.360 --> 38:39.400
'Cause you are one of the sanest
guys that Sam has ever been with.

38:39.400 --> 38:41.490
We're just friends,Gracie.

38:41.490 --> 38:44.280
That's what Angelina and Brad said.

38:45.830 --> 38:46.930
Hey.

38:48.480 --> 38:50.920
Upstairs,do your homework,
brush your teeth and go to bed,okay?

38:50.920 --> 38:52.820
Tomorrow we talk about the new rules.

38:52.820 --> 38:53.400
Okay. Go.

38:53.400 --> 38:54.970
All right!

38:57.430 --> 38:58.480
I'm sorry.

38:59.550 --> 39:01.940
You owe me dinner,right?

39:01.940 --> 39:03.920
I'm so sorry. I forgot.

39:03.920 --> 39:09.830
Uh,okay,we finish unloading
and then I will order us a pizza or...

39:09.830 --> 39:12.010
I've got a better idea.

39:26.820 --> 39:28.800
I'm glad we got past the awkward part.

39:30.850 --> 39:32.750
Yeah.

39:39.100 --> 39:41.510
You need a pharmacy license to dispense meds

39:41.510 --> 39:43.810
and your malpractice insurance
covers you only in the hospital.

39:43.810 --> 39:45.510
I know. I...

39:45.510 --> 39:46.910
I was trying to give back.

39:46.910 --> 39:49.380
It's a felony,Pratt.
A man died.

39:50.900 --> 39:52.470
- What was I thinking?
- I don't know.

39:52.470 --> 39:55.270
This,this goes against
everything you've learned.

40:06.290 --> 40:08.080
You okay,man?

40:10.220 --> 40:12.440
I don't know what to do.

40:14.260 --> 40:16.580
Were you the only one involved?

40:16.880 --> 40:20.080
Yeah,yeah,it was just me.

40:20.080 --> 40:22.520
Good. That's good.

40:22.960 --> 40:26.190
I'll,uh,
talk to Angela,see what I can do.

40:28.860 --> 40:30.710
Take a minute,okay?

40:41.360 --> 40:42.900
All right,see you guys later.

40:42.900 --> 40:44.890
Dr. Weaver,I need an
attending order for Vanco.

40:44.890 --> 40:46.960
Yeah,can you sign off
on my retinal detachment?

40:47.950 --> 40:49.860
Okay,thank you.

40:51.810 --> 40:53.550
Kerry,Kerry,we need to talk.

40:53.550 --> 40:55.820
Oh,it's okay. I'm fine.

40:55.820 --> 40:57.020
Hey,I made a mistake.

40:57.020 --> 40:59.350
What I said before,
you know how it is in this job.

40:59.350 --> 41:01.290
I shouldn't give in to the pressure.

41:01.290 --> 41:04.820
Look,I'm gonna,I'm gonna find budget cuts
somewhere else. There is no way we're losing you.

41:04.820 --> 41:07.540
Thanks,but,uh,
I resign.

41:08.540 --> 41:09.860
You what?

41:09.860 --> 41:11.670
I can't...

41:11.670 --> 41:14.840
I've trained residents,
I've saved lives,

41:14.840 --> 41:18.060
I even ran this place.

41:18.060 --> 41:20.120
I loved it.

41:20.120 --> 41:22.770
And I've probably gotten
more than I've given,

41:22.770 --> 41:25.180
but now it's time to go.

41:25.180 --> 41:26.620
Dr. Weaver,what are you saying?

41:26.620 --> 41:28.220
Kerry?

41:28.950 --> 41:31.800
It's easy here. It's comfortable,

41:31.800 --> 41:34.830
but that doesn't mean it's
the right thing to stay.

41:35.570 --> 41:36.730
Are you gonna go to Florida?

41:36.730 --> 41:40.850
Yeah,I mean,after Sandy died,I...

41:41.890 --> 41:44.730
I thought I got over it.
I thought I moved on,but I...

41:45.920 --> 41:49.290
I felt stuck,like I'm treading water

41:49.290 --> 41:50.830
and it's taken a few years,

41:50.830 --> 41:54.990
but now I'm finally ready to move forward.

41:55.480 --> 41:57.210
So...

41:58.850 --> 42:02.670
if you're ever in Miami, turn on channel
six and that's where you'll find me.

42:02.670 --> 42:06.930
And if I'm not there
I'll be on the beach with my son.
