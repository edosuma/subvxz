The headmistress of this academy, your

29:04.203 --> 29:07.956
Given the seriousness of these events
and after careful consideration,

29:08.040 --> 29:09.958
it is the grim duty of this council

29:10.042 --> 29:12.794
to demand your immediate,
unconditional abdication

29:12.878 --> 29:14.213
as Supreme of this coven.

29:14.296 --> 29:15.714
It's nothing personal.

29:16.048 --> 29:21.094
And given that the new Supreme
has not shown herself yet?

29:21.178 --> 29:24.973
Until such time, the coven shall fall
under the stewardship of this council.

29:26.058 --> 29:27.351
How convenient.

29:28.685 --> 29:31.438
She couldn't inherit the Supremacy,

29:31.522 --> 29:35.067
so she has enlisted her lapdogs
to help steal it.

29:35.150 --> 29:36.443

29:36.527 --> 29:38.987
Oh, yes, you will beg,

29:39.071 --> 29:41.573
but you will not be pardoned,

not for what you have done.

29:47.204 --> 29:50.332
It's a trick, a gambit.
She's desperate.

29:50.415 --> 29:52.835
Well, it's not going to work,
not this time.

is unanimous and final.

29:55.462 --> 29:57.339

30:09.268 --> 30:12.646
this coven has been under attack
but not from outside,

30:13.063 --> 30:14.356

by destroying my daughter,

30:43.260 --> 30:44.720
you could destroy me?

30:44.803 --> 30:48.557
How dare you accuse me
of attacking Cordelia?

I've been more of a mother to that girl
than you have ever been.

30:51.018 --> 30:56.523
You latched on to my daughter
the minute I passed her into your care

30:56.607 --> 30:58.650
because you could never have one.

30:58.734 --> 31:02.946
I never had children because
I dedicated my life to this coven.

31:03.030 --> 31:05.949
The love you had for this coven
and my daughter

31:06.033 --> 31:09.119
has been eclipsed
by the hatred you have of me.

31:09.203 --> 31:10.454
Will you listen to her?

31:10.537 --> 31:13.123
Next she'll be accusing me
of murdering Madison Montgomery.

31:13.207 --> 31:17.127
Well, you were here in New Orleans,
at the time of her disappearance, I mean.

31:17.461 --> 31:18.754
What is she talking about?

31:18.837 --> 31:22.049
I told you, she's trying to confuse you.

31:22.132 --> 31:25.469
You weren't already in town
when Madison went missing, were you?

have told us that.

<i>Planning this coup.</i>

32:00.587 --> 32:02.548
She's twisting everything!

32:02.631 --> 32:04.216
So, it's true?

32:04.299 --> 32:06.260
You've been living here
under a false name?

32:06.343 --> 32:07.636
She had to be stopped!

32:07.719 --> 32:08.720
Is that a confession?

32:08.804 --> 32:10.305
What? No!

32:10.389 --> 32:11.473
I confess to nothing!

32:11.557 --> 32:13.100
FIONA: I don't need a confession.

32:13.183 --> 32:15.602
You have been caught red-handed.

PEMBROKE: Myrtle Snow…

32:28.031 --> 32:30.367
Have you anything to say
in your own defense?

32:30.450 --> 32:32.995
You know what she is.

32:33.078 --> 32:34.371
Who would you believe?

32:34.454 --> 32:35.664
You give us no choice.

32:39.126 --> 32:40.127
Burn the witch.

32:41.170 --> 32:42.462
Seconded.

32:43.213 --> 32:45.549
FIONA: The decision of this council

32:45.632 --> 32:47.843
is unanimous and final.

32:53.015 --> 32:54.308
No need to bind me.

32:54.391 --> 32:56.226
I shall not resist.

32:56.685 --> 32:57.978
Why would I?

32:58.061 --> 33:01.398
I've been swimming against the tide
my whole life.

33:02.441 --> 33:03.734
Look where it got me.

33:04.318 --> 33:06.486
I'm used to being an outcast.

33:06.570 --> 33:08.322
The freak.

33:08.405 --> 33:10.949
Until I found my place in this coven.

33:11.533 --> 33:13.619
I thought I'd come home.

33:13.702 --> 33:14.953
But I was wrong.

33:18.582 --> 33:20.709
I go proudly to the flame.

33:22.878 --> 33:23.921
Go ahead.

33:25.964 --> 33:27.257
Burn me.

33:28.884 --> 33:31.261
(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

33:44.024 --> 33:45.901
This is just a joke, right?

33:46.777 --> 33:48.987
We're not actually burning her.

33:49.071 --> 33:50.822

Queenie, well, what can I do for you?

36:22.933 --> 36:24.476
You can answer me a question.

36:25.310 --> 36:26.436
Yes?

36:30.065 --> 36:31.316
Today…

36:33.026 --> 36:36.446
Did I help you frame a guilty woman
or an innocent one?

36:36.530 --> 36:38.407
MYRTLE: <i>She's been leading this coven</i>
<i>to extinction!</i>

36:38.490 --> 36:40.409
We've all said it! She had to be stopped!

36:40.492 --> 36:41.743
Is that a confession?

36:41.827 --> 36:43.620
What? No!
I confess to nothing!

36:43.704 --> 36:46.540
FIONA: You don't have to confess.
You've been caught red-handed.

36:46.874 --> 36:48.000
MYRTLE: You're hurting me!

36:48.083 --> 36:52.129
FIONA: I'll do more than hurt you!
I will have justice!

36:52.296 --> 36:56.258
The same acid that disfigured
my daughter did this!

36:56.341 --> 36:58.177
None of us are innocent,

36:59.094 --> 37:00.637
no one.

37:02.264 --> 37:03.765
Look.

37:03.849 --> 37:06.018
When you came to me,
I figure I owed you one

37:06.101 --> 37:08.729
'cause you… You saved my life.

37:09.730 --> 37:12.316
But I thought we were going
to oust her, not roast her.

37:12.399 --> 37:16.820
And now I can't… I can't close my eyes
without seeing her burning body.

37:16.904 --> 37:20.157
And the… The smell won't
leave my nose, I just…

37:23.035 --> 37:25.037
I don't think I can do it.

37:26.205 --> 37:28.373
Sit down.

37:30.334 --> 37:31.710
Do what, Queenie?

37:35.130 --> 37:36.715
Live with this.

37:38.425 --> 37:40.260
Now, Queenie.

37:40.344 --> 37:43.680
I can already sense a change in you.

37:44.306 --> 37:46.558
Your mind is getting stronger.

37:47.935 --> 37:50.187
You've taken an important first step.

37:50.270 --> 37:53.899
A necessary first step
to fulfill your promise.

37:54.691 --> 37:56.610
And under my tutelage,

37:56.693 --> 37:58.111
my mentorship,

37:58.195 --> 38:00.572
well, you could rise to heights

38:15.420 --> 38:18.173
Well, why not? I mean…

38:18.257 --> 38:20.467
Maybe that's what this coven needs.

38:21.134 --> 38:23.303
A Supreme of…

38:23.387 --> 38:25.055
Color.

38:25.138 --> 38:26.306
Yeah.

38:26.390 --> 38:29.518
Why not me, right?
I'm as much witch as any of these others.

38:29.601 --> 38:30.602
More.

38:31.395 --> 38:33.647
And I am feeling stronger.

38:33.730 --> 38:36.358
-More powerful.
-Of course you are.

38:36.441 --> 38:38.026
Yes.

38:39.403 --> 38:40.737
You have to trust me.
