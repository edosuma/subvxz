WEBVTT

02:32.277 --> 02:34.487
What was that about with Rivi?

02:37.282 --> 02:38.324
It's a Rivi thing.

02:40.743 --> 02:41.870
Griselda.

02:47.375 --> 02:49.878
I hear CENTAC was in D.C.

02:49.878 --> 02:51.713
I heard the same.

02:52.922 --> 02:54.841
What can I do for you, Rafa?

02:55.508 --> 02:56.926
Someone I want you to meet.

03:58.696 --> 03:59.530
Griselda.

04:01.241 --> 04:02.867
John is a heavy hitter.

04:03.743 --> 04:05.203
Fabio likes him.

04:06.496 --> 04:08.831
He also likes the money I make him.

04:09.707 --> 04:12.877
But if you want to call and tell him

04:12.877 --> 04:16.881
I hurt your guy's vagina, be my guest.

04:19.425 --> 04:20.260
Let's go.

04:26.015 --> 04:29.018
Do you have to embarrass Rafa
and his friend like that?

04:29.018 --> 04:32.605
I'd like to put a bullet
in his head for Arturo.

04:44.284 --> 04:46.828
Bro, they know.

04:49.289 --> 04:54.419
Chucho, my brother's a buzzkill.
Know that word? "Buzzkill."

04:54.419 --> 04:56.296
Buzzkill? <i>You're</i> the buzzkill.

04:58.756 --> 05:00.008
Hey, fix that.

05:00.008 --> 05:01.968
It's fine.

05:05.805 --> 05:06.806
My boys!

05:06.806 --> 05:07.807
Mom.

05:09.559 --> 05:10.685
How'd it go today?

05:10.685 --> 05:11.894
Well...

05:12.603 --> 05:15.940
250 owed on last week's shipment.

05:16.649 --> 05:18.943
250 collected.

05:20.486 --> 05:21.571
My princes.

05:21.571 --> 05:26.617
My success is yours.
They mess with you, they mess with me.

05:27.410 --> 05:30.621
One day, everyone will know
the Blanco name.

05:37.378 --> 05:38.338
Let's get a drink.

05:42.258 --> 05:43.092
Griselda.

05:43.593 --> 05:44.719
It's Carter.

05:46.304 --> 05:47.930
He wants to talk about his cut.

08:58.037 --> 08:59.247
Fucking genius.

09:00.957 --> 09:02.708
This isn't over.

09:04.377 --> 09:06.295
We have to get to the bottom of this.

09:07.505 --> 09:08.339
What's that?

09:08.965 --> 09:10.841
CENTAC was in D.C.

09:10.841 --> 09:14.887
They had intel
that was gonna be used against us.

09:15.513 --> 09:17.640
But who gave them that intel?

09:19.600 --> 09:22.103
So you think there's a leak?

09:22.687 --> 09:24.021
We know there is.

09:24.772 --> 09:26.148
Question is who.

09:26.148 --> 09:28.401
This is some of the people on our payroll.

09:28.401 --> 09:30.820
Some have past issues
with law enforcement.

09:30.820 --> 09:33.197
Others who've bought from rival suppliers.

09:33.197 --> 09:36.367
And others who've said something
against Griselda.

09:37.743 --> 09:38.995
Is that so?

09:38.995 --> 09:42.582
We clean house, make sure we're sealed up.

09:43.666 --> 09:44.875
And then Griselda...

09:46.794 --> 09:48.379
will be walking on clouds.

09:50.464 --> 09:51.340
Estela.

09:55.595 --> 09:56.762
Here I am.

09:56.762 --> 09:59.515
How are we doing
with Dario's birthday party?

09:59.515 --> 10:00.433
Good.

10:01.309 --> 10:03.019
I've got the guest list right here.

10:03.019 --> 10:06.314
Just get a lot of whiskey.

10:06.314 --> 10:07.857
Of course.

10:08.733 --> 10:11.027
What I want to know is, when's the party?

10:11.027 --> 10:13.321
Two weeks from now.

10:15.865 --> 10:17.575
See you later. Excuse me.

10:21.996 --> 10:24.415
I want this done before the party.

10:26.667 --> 10:29.211
Wait, that's a lot of people.

10:31.047 --> 10:34.967
I spent too many years
looking over my shoulder, Dario.

10:34.967 --> 10:38.763
I've always been burned by these assholes.
That's not happening ever again.

10:43.976 --> 10:47.688
This way, we can enjoy
your birthday party in peace.

15:17.374 --> 15:24.340
Thank you for coming
to celebrate my husband.

15:25.591 --> 15:29.929
The father of our beautiful son,
Michael Corleone.

15:31.096 --> 15:35.517
Stepfather to my Uber, Ozzy, and Dixon.

15:54.745 --> 15:56.538
But now to why we're here.

15:57.247 --> 15:58.707
When we got married,

15:58.707 --> 16:02.127
I told Dario he was no longer my bodyguard

16:02.920 --> 16:04.254
because he was now my husband.

16:04.880 --> 16:08.926
Of course, being Dario,
he didn't like that much.

16:10.010 --> 16:13.347
I told him he was just trading
the metal in his pocket

16:13.347 --> 16:15.391
for gold in his wallet.

16:16.475 --> 16:21.146
Yes, he loves his speedboat, his Caddie.

16:21.146 --> 16:26.402
But I think he still misses
being my tough guy.

16:27.361 --> 16:33.075
So I thought I'd give him
the best of both worlds.

16:36.537 --> 16:37.830
Holy shit.

16:42.626 --> 16:44.586
For my golden gun.

16:50.009 --> 16:53.262
Of course, I got you all presents too.

16:54.263 --> 16:56.515
Have an appetizer.
There's more than plenty.

17:06.442 --> 17:07.901
Happy birthday, my love.

17:07.901 --> 17:10.112
Thank you. You shouldn't have.

17:12.281 --> 17:13.115
Let's dance.

17:58.452 --> 17:59.912
The Godmother.

18:12.382 --> 18:13.801
This isn't so bad.

18:16.053 --> 18:18.847
Never dreamed I'd get this far.

18:25.437 --> 18:26.271
Griselda.

18:27.564 --> 18:29.149
We have a problem.

18:29.817 --> 18:31.568
How's it possible?

18:31.568 --> 18:34.196
We eliminated anyone who could talk.

18:34.822 --> 18:38.992
How the fuck did they find a stash house
all the way in Fort Lauderdale?

18:40.869 --> 18:42.454
We haven't found the informant.

18:43.163 --> 18:44.832
Or maybe they had other intel.

18:47.334 --> 18:49.336
They're just trying to get in your head.

18:54.716 --> 18:58.554
I'll do some digging,
talk to our police contacts,

18:59.513 --> 19:00.514
see what I can find.

19:05.394 --> 19:06.436
Come dance with me.

19:09.314 --> 19:10.149
Let's go.

19:12.025 --> 19:13.318
I'll see you down there.

20:38.487 --> 20:39.529
Hold on.

20:41.156 --> 20:42.658
What's up?

20:43.325 --> 20:46.161
How's the party? Everyone's having fun?

20:47.371 --> 20:49.206
Rafa and I already fucked in the bathroom.

20:50.290 --> 20:52.209
Look, no panty party.

20:53.627 --> 20:59.132
Dario may like your wet pussy
more than a gold gun.

21:01.635 --> 21:03.095
Marta, tell me something.

21:04.263 --> 21:07.599
You remember John talking
to your cousin Fabio lately?

21:07.599 --> 21:09.935
Have they ever met or talked in private?

21:11.728 --> 21:12.980
What are you afraid of?

21:14.481 --> 21:16.358
No one's gonna touch you now.

21:17.192 --> 21:18.902
I just want to be sure.

21:20.279 --> 21:24.700
Come to think of it,
John and Fabio did meet last week.

21:24.700 --> 21:25.742
But...

21:29.246 --> 21:30.706
It was nothing.

21:30.706 --> 21:35.585
Look, you want to relax?
I brought something for you. Yes or no?

21:37.879 --> 21:39.172
Here. Take it.

21:39.172 --> 21:40.090
It's crack.

21:42.259 --> 21:46.388
That shit fucks me harder
than Rafa ever can. That's it.

21:51.143 --> 21:56.732
Fuck. I'm leaking and no panties.

22:22.132 --> 22:25.510
Griselda.

22:30.766 --> 22:32.768
John and Fabio met.

22:33.852 --> 22:37.481
What if that asshole's been tipping
the cops to fuck me over?

22:38.565 --> 22:41.693
Roberts is a dick,
but he's not gonna risk coming at you.

22:42.277 --> 22:44.196
And Marta is crazy, likes to play games.

22:44.196 --> 22:47.074
Rafa shot Arturo right in front of me.

22:47.074 --> 22:49.659
He's always wanted
to take me out of the business.

22:50.410 --> 22:52.871
If you kill one,
you'd have to do all three.

22:52.871 --> 22:55.332
Who fucking said anything about killing?

22:55.332 --> 22:58.585
We need to take this seriously.

22:58.585 --> 23:02.839
I didn't hear her say anything
about killing anyone.

23:02.839 --> 23:05.133
Don't put fucking words in her mouth.

23:05.133 --> 23:06.968
Shut the fuck up!

23:11.181 --> 23:13.100
What the fuck's going on?

23:14.893 --> 23:16.061
Eat shit, motherfucker!

23:19.689 --> 23:22.234
You said if someone comes at us,
they're coming at you.

23:22.234 --> 23:24.069
- Not sure this is what she meant.
- Shut up!

23:24.069 --> 23:26.196
Don't you think
you've used enough tonight?

23:26.822 --> 23:28.573
You are not my dad.

23:30.033 --> 23:33.245
What the fuck did I tell you about using?

23:33.245 --> 23:34.621
Are you serious?

23:35.205 --> 23:37.749
You literally served coke as an appetizer.

23:39.042 --> 23:40.877
I can't deal with this bullshit right now!

23:40.877 --> 23:42.379
Let's go!

23:59.980 --> 24:00.814
Estela.

24:01.481 --> 24:02.691
Bring the cake out now!

24:35.849 --> 24:38.602
Thank you all so much for coming.

24:39.644 --> 24:41.438
I'm so happy that you're here.

24:42.314 --> 24:45.066
But now it's time to dance, right? Music!

24:52.365 --> 24:53.200
Hey.

24:54.117 --> 24:54.951
Can we talk?

25:06.379 --> 25:07.547
Want your other present?

25:07.547 --> 25:08.506
No.

25:10.008 --> 25:10.842
What is it?

25:11.676 --> 25:13.887
Look a little closer at your life.

25:14.596 --> 25:19.809
Rivi's putting fucking ideas
in your head every day.

25:20.560 --> 25:21.770
And you know it.

25:22.687 --> 25:24.606
You use too much, my love.

25:26.233 --> 25:28.068
You're killing people for nothing.

25:30.403 --> 25:32.781
Know what I'd rather have
as a birthday present?

25:34.532 --> 25:39.496
Take our boys and leave this place,
away from all these people.

25:39.496 --> 25:42.707
I'm finally on top,
and you want us to leave?

25:47.837 --> 25:50.006
Better to get out on top.

25:52.217 --> 25:54.052
You're always questioning me.

25:54.052 --> 25:55.929
Why do you think I do it?

25:57.806 --> 25:58.974
I'm protecting you.

26:01.393 --> 26:03.144
Could it be you're the informant?

26:05.021 --> 26:06.731
Go fuck yourself.

26:12.779 --> 26:14.823
Mrs. Blanco.

26:18.535 --> 26:20.578
Dario can't have all the fun.

26:21.538 --> 26:23.540
I have a little surprise for you.

26:39.389 --> 26:42.309
This is what a queen deserves.

27:02.120 --> 27:06.875
Cutie. Does this look okay?

27:08.335 --> 27:09.919
Don't mess up my hair.

27:12.088 --> 27:13.506
Like nothing happened.

27:32.650 --> 27:34.486
The fuck's her problem?

27:35.820 --> 27:37.113
She just worries.

27:37.113 --> 27:39.407
What's she worrying about,
the fucking pipe?

27:40.325 --> 27:42.202
Is she spying on you?

27:44.037 --> 27:45.830
Mind your own business.

27:47.040 --> 27:47.874
Bitch.

27:52.212 --> 27:54.214
Go get a drink. I'll find you, okay?

28:06.559 --> 28:08.812
Tell Chucho to keep an eye on Carmen.

28:10.188 --> 28:11.523
Something's up with her.

28:13.108 --> 28:15.777
Chucho didn't come tonight.
Stayed home with his kid.

28:17.570 --> 28:18.780
He's not here?

28:20.240 --> 28:22.033
Your house is in order, Griselda.

28:22.033 --> 28:24.452
But how'd they find the stash house?

28:24.452 --> 28:26.329
Had some old intel.

28:26.913 --> 28:29.833
So I'm absolutely certain we're good.

28:30.959 --> 28:31.918
Don't worry.

28:33.461 --> 28:37.090
You know you're... safe.

28:38.716 --> 28:40.677
- I'm safe.
- Yes.

28:42.429 --> 28:43.680
Relax.

28:45.390 --> 28:46.683
Enjoy the party.

29:32.228 --> 29:33.062
Mom?

29:33.813 --> 29:35.148
Can I talk to you?

29:37.066 --> 29:37.901
Come in.

29:47.619 --> 29:48.995
This party, it's too much.

29:51.581 --> 29:56.586
I saw Michael Corleone using a coke straw
to drink chocolate milk.

29:57.212 --> 29:59.672
It's all in good fun, Uber.

29:59.672 --> 30:00.965
And Dixon?

30:01.633 --> 30:05.345
He's freaking out.
Took off with his girlfriend.

30:05.345 --> 30:06.930
Let him blow off some steam

30:06.930 --> 30:09.265
instead of kicking the shit
out of my guests.

30:11.226 --> 30:12.477
I wonder...

30:14.437 --> 30:16.147
where he learned to do that.

30:19.484 --> 30:22.445
Listen to me, you ungrateful little shit.

30:23.363 --> 30:27.283
Everything I do,
I do for you and your brothers.

30:28.159 --> 30:32.080
Dixon was behaving like
an asshole, and now you are too.

30:38.837 --> 30:39.671
Fine.

30:41.339 --> 30:42.340
Godmother.

33:15.785 --> 33:16.619
Dario.

33:18.287 --> 33:22.291
Fireworks are about to start.
Don't want you to miss it.

33:31.884 --> 33:32.719
What's up?

33:35.179 --> 33:36.014
You okay?

34:32.487 --> 34:33.321
Dario...

34:38.117 --> 34:39.327
What the fuck is this?

34:41.871 --> 34:43.956
What the fuck is what? We're talking.

34:44.665 --> 34:45.500
Talking?

34:47.168 --> 34:49.879
Talking is not what this bitch does.

34:49.879 --> 34:50.922
Griselda.

34:50.922 --> 34:54.467
- Go fuck yourself.
- What the fuck did you just say to me?!

34:56.427 --> 34:59.430
Let go of me!

35:07.146 --> 35:07.980
Move!

35:15.863 --> 35:16.697
Fuck!

35:16.697 --> 35:17.615
Griselda.

35:18.366 --> 35:19.200
Give me that gun.

35:19.784 --> 35:20.743
You motherfucker.

35:21.327 --> 35:24.539
I was worried about some stranger
stabbing me in the back

35:24.539 --> 35:26.374
and look what you do.

35:26.374 --> 35:28.793
We weren't doing anything.
We were just talking.

35:28.793 --> 35:31.629
What the fuck
do you have to tell that bitch?

35:31.629 --> 35:33.714
Were you complaining
about how I castrate you?

35:33.714 --> 35:36.717
- How I don't let you kill for me anymore?
- Griselda, stop.

35:36.717 --> 35:40.221
How I don't listen to you and only listen
to Rivi? Poor little Dario.

35:40.221 --> 35:43.015
You want to know
what we were talking about? Do you?

35:43.933 --> 35:46.352
How you're a terrible fucking mother.

35:48.146 --> 35:49.564
That's what I was talking about.

35:49.564 --> 35:54.485
You ruined your boys and I'm not
gonna let that happen to Michael.

35:55.319 --> 35:58.156
I'm fed up. You're fucking crazy.

35:59.407 --> 36:00.700
Bad mother.

36:01.659 --> 36:02.910
Let's talk inside.

36:03.578 --> 36:04.704
Lousy wife.

36:04.704 --> 36:06.080
Calm down.

36:10.835 --> 36:11.669
What are you doing?

36:19.468 --> 36:20.887
What the fuck are you doing?

36:21.721 --> 36:23.764
You're lucky it wasn't you.

36:25.224 --> 36:27.894
You want to shoot me? You want to kill me?

36:27.894 --> 36:31.856
Go ahead and shoot me in the back.
That way you won't see my fucking face.

40:14.495 --> 40:17.915
Die! Die, you fucking bitch!

40:20.292 --> 40:21.127
Let go of her!

40:21.127 --> 40:25.047
Fucking bitch! Fucking let go of me!

40:25.047 --> 40:27.883
Calm down!

40:37.768 --> 40:39.437
What the fuck was that?

40:42.523 --> 40:44.525
You've had enough, don't you think?

40:45.276 --> 40:46.402
Look at me, Griselda.

40:47.862 --> 40:50.197
Carmen is not the informant.

40:52.158 --> 40:54.410
It's all in your mind.

41:04.128 --> 41:05.296
How's the party?

41:08.591 --> 41:09.425
The party?

41:11.051 --> 41:14.930
The party went to shit after you forced
the guests to fuck at gunpoint.

41:15.848 --> 41:17.850
What did you think was going to happen?

41:19.602 --> 41:20.769
What was all that?

41:21.854 --> 41:23.230
You need to trust me.

41:24.940 --> 41:28.360
Instead, you do what?
Embarrass me in front of all those people.

41:37.495 --> 41:39.413
You did it to yourself, Dario.

41:44.376 --> 41:47.129
Soon as we found out about Michael,

41:48.339 --> 41:49.673
you went soft.

41:51.175 --> 41:52.343
You wanted me to stop.

41:54.053 --> 41:56.055
To just keep my territory.

41:57.264 --> 42:00.518
I knew if I wanted to win,
I needed someone like Rivi.

42:01.644 --> 42:02.478
"Soft."

42:06.232 --> 42:08.484
I just wanted to be a father for Michael.

42:14.698 --> 42:17.368
Now I don't even know
why I did all of this.

42:20.204 --> 42:21.914
Why I killed those people.

42:25.793 --> 42:26.919
Why I hurt you.

42:29.755 --> 42:30.589
For what?

42:33.217 --> 42:35.761
For a giant fucking walk-in closet?

42:40.558 --> 42:42.226
We're both rotting in here.

42:46.230 --> 42:49.400
In this beautiful house,
with that fucking huge closet.

42:50.109 --> 42:52.027
And we're rotting, my love.

43:00.119 --> 43:00.953
I love you.

43:04.915 --> 43:06.709
Forget all that other stuff.

43:07.293 --> 43:11.714
Forget the informant.
Forget all you had to do to get here.

43:13.924 --> 43:18.345
Let's take all that money and leave
with our kids. Let's start from scratch.

43:20.472 --> 43:22.933
You have to stop all of this now.

43:40.326 --> 43:43.037
Griselda, I get that the world
fucked you for so long.

43:46.999 --> 43:47.833
But not me.

43:50.502 --> 43:52.254
Never me.

43:55.883 --> 43:57.509
I don't trust you anymore.

44:04.642 --> 44:05.476
Now go.

44:20.366 --> 44:22.242
Fuck everyone.

45:36.150 --> 45:38.569
- Chucho.
- Dixon, what's going on?

45:39.945 --> 45:42.906
- What did you do?
- Tell him to leave, Chucho.

45:45.993 --> 45:48.203
You brought the cops?

45:48.203 --> 45:51.248
This asshole pinched
my girl's ass, and I lost my temper.

45:51.248 --> 45:54.626
Take the gun and hide me. Say you did it.

45:54.626 --> 45:58.172
No! Please, Chucho, don't.
These people are killing you.

45:58.172 --> 46:00.382
It's better you go back to your house.

46:00.382 --> 46:02.134
- No.
- I have a kid here. Calm down.

46:02.134 --> 46:03.677
- No.
- Go back to your house.

46:03.677 --> 46:06.763
This is your job. You have to help me.

46:10.309 --> 46:14.521
These people are killing you.
Tell him to leave, Chucho.

46:14.521 --> 46:15.606
Chucho, what the fuck?

46:26.783 --> 46:27.618
Dixon!

46:29.453 --> 46:30.287
Fuck!

46:39.254 --> 46:40.088
Mom.

46:50.015 --> 46:51.850
Dixon, what happened?

46:53.769 --> 46:56.980
I went to Chucho for help, and he hit me.

47:03.153 --> 47:04.363
He did that to you?

47:06.698 --> 47:08.951
Fucker was also gonna
give me up to the cops.

47:10.077 --> 47:12.246
You've got to teach him a lesson.

47:13.330 --> 47:15.249
Get some rest.

47:25.342 --> 47:26.760
I want you to kill Chucho.

47:32.182 --> 47:33.392
He's the informant.

47:35.102 --> 47:36.728
He wasn't here all night.

47:37.896 --> 47:40.816
No doubt he's talking
to that CENTAC bitch.

47:41.942 --> 47:46.238
She approached Carmen.
Probably just had more luck with Chucho.

47:47.281 --> 47:48.907
We don't know that.

47:49.658 --> 47:54.913
What I know is
I'm having to do your job for you.

48:01.837 --> 48:03.297
All due respect, Griselda,

48:05.048 --> 48:08.552
my job has always been to help make you
the most powerful person in Miami.

48:10.220 --> 48:12.764
If you kill one of your own on a theory,

48:14.266 --> 48:15.350
that's not power.

48:17.144 --> 48:17.978
That's fear.

48:17.978 --> 48:18.895
Fear?

48:19.896 --> 48:21.356
He hit my son.

48:23.692 --> 48:26.069
You know, Dario was right.

48:26.903 --> 48:29.448
You think you can control me.

48:29.990 --> 48:32.618
That I only listen
to what you have to say.

48:32.618 --> 48:35.037
I'm protecting you.

48:35.037 --> 48:38.123
If one more man tells me
he's protecting me,

48:38.123 --> 48:39.916
I'm going to cut his balls off!

48:41.418 --> 48:45.047
Tonight's taught me
there aren't many people I can trust.

48:45.047 --> 48:49.301
And you. Have you warned me
about any of them? No!

48:49.301 --> 48:51.595
That makes me not trust you.

48:52.804 --> 48:55.098
I would never betray you,
Griselda. You know that.

48:55.098 --> 48:57.476
Stop telling me what I know!

48:57.476 --> 49:01.897
That's exactly what makes me think
you'd betray me.

49:09.529 --> 49:10.364
Okay.

49:14.660 --> 49:15.494
I'll do it.

50:08.380 --> 50:09.756
Fuck!

50:34.364 --> 50:35.240
Did you do it?

50:37.743 --> 50:38.952
I missed him, Griselda.

50:39.661 --> 50:40.787
So he's alive?

50:48.712 --> 50:49.963
Thank God.

50:51.965 --> 50:53.717
If you still doubt my loyalty,

50:58.138 --> 50:59.681
I can make my own living.

51:02.684 --> 51:04.603
That won't be necessary, Rivi.

51:07.856 --> 51:08.690
Thank you.

51:26.541 --> 51:27.709
Good morning.

51:29.377 --> 51:31.129
<i>- Miami police said...</i>
- I said good morning.

51:34.966 --> 51:37.177
- What is it?
<i>- ...as we are only hours removed</i>

51:57.989 --> 51:58.824
What happened?

52:01.326 --> 52:02.994
Someone killed Chucho's son, Mom.
