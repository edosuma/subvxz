[June] Previously on
The Handmaid's Tale...

Find her.

00:04.467 --> 00:05.637
-[gunshot]
-[gasps]

00:07.849 --> 00:08.809
And bring her to me.

00:08.976 --> 00:09.895
[grunts]

00:10.730 --> 00:13.318
You have to tell me
where the handmaids are.

00:13.485 --> 00:15.197
Or they will hurt Hannah.

00:15.280 --> 00:16.282
It's okay, baby.

00:17.201 --> 00:19.038
They're at the Murrow farmhouse.

00:19.205 --> 00:22.378
Everything that has happened
to you, to Hannah,

00:22.461 --> 00:23.839
to Janine, and the others.

00:23.923 --> 00:26.094
You're responsible. Your fault.

00:26.469 --> 00:27.346
[June] We're gonna go West.

00:27.429 --> 00:29.559
Chicago is still Chicago.
They're not giving up.

00:29.768 --> 00:32.691
Commander Blaine, you will
coordinate an aerial bombardment

00:32.774 --> 00:34.820
on all insurgent fronts.

00:34.945 --> 00:35.947
Run!

00:44.338 --> 00:45.173
Moira?

00:45.340 --> 00:46.927
I fucking found you.

00:47.804 --> 00:50.643
If I don't go back,
Hannah is gone forever.

00:51.019 --> 00:55.402
I'm her mother
and it's my job to protect her.

00:59.661 --> 01:01.497
I'm sorry I don't have her.

01:02.041 --> 01:03.586
I'm sorry it's just me.

01:04.170 --> 01:05.882
-I knew it would-- I'm sorry.
-No, no, no.

01:06.675 --> 01:08.470
-I'm sorry.
-[shushes]

01:08.596 --> 01:09.806
I'm so sorry.

01:09.931 --> 01:12.019
I am a citizen
of the United States,

01:12.186 --> 01:15.233
and I seek asylum
in the country of Canada.

01:16.110 --> 01:19.158
Luke, I need to tell you about
the last time I saw Hannah.

01:20.243 --> 01:22.749
We have to find her
and bring her to Canada.

01:23.333 --> 01:24.920
I never thought
I'd give it to you in person.

01:25.003 --> 01:25.922
Oh, my God.

01:26.632 --> 01:28.009
[Nick] At least you know
where she is now.

01:28.176 --> 01:30.013
I should've run away with you
when I had the chance.

01:33.478 --> 01:35.148
[Serena] I need to separate
my interests from Fred.

01:35.232 --> 01:36.109
I am done with him.

01:36.192 --> 01:37.277
We can talk about that later.

01:37.361 --> 01:38.656
No, we can talk
about it right now.

01:38.739 --> 01:40.200
You're pregnant, Serena.

01:40.743 --> 01:41.912
Congratulations.

01:42.246 --> 01:45.711
With Offred now in Canada,
we can't be naive about that.

01:46.003 --> 01:47.381
We need to drop our fight.

01:47.841 --> 01:50.011
[crowd cheering]

01:50.888 --> 01:52.224
My name is June Osborn

01:52.767 --> 01:55.815
Fred Waterford and Serena Joy
imprisoned me,

01:56.567 --> 01:58.361
beat me, and raped me.

01:59.531 --> 02:00.825
I ask for justice.

02:01.242 --> 02:03.163
[Serena]
Gilead could come for our son.

02:03.413 --> 02:04.958
They could make me a Handmaid.

02:05.083 --> 02:06.294
I'll do everything in my power

02:06.377 --> 02:09.049
to make sure you and our son
are protected.

02:09.341 --> 02:11.179
[Luke] So, what happens next?
How do we get Hannah?

02:11.262 --> 02:12.097
[Mark] We have a new asset.

02:12.181 --> 02:13.391
He knows
how the system operates.

02:13.475 --> 02:14.435
He could advise us.

02:14.561 --> 02:15.980
-Who is it?
-Fred Waterford.

02:16.690 --> 02:17.650
Waterford?

02:17.734 --> 02:19.361
[Mark] The prosecution
has dropped its charges.

02:19.445 --> 02:21.658
-June!
-He's a fucking rapist!

02:21.867 --> 02:26.125
You know what he did
to all of us! I will kill you!

02:26.250 --> 02:28.254
They're sending Waterford
to fucking Geneva!

02:28.506 --> 02:29.716
They're gonna
fly the prick there

02:29.800 --> 02:31.010
and have his immunity hearing.

02:31.177 --> 02:32.764
And then he's free
to just set up

02:32.847 --> 02:36.563
wherever the fuck he wants,
with his Viking-ass wife.

02:37.022 --> 02:41.949
Twenty-two of these women
worked with the Resistance.

02:42.449 --> 02:43.536
And you can save them.

02:44.286 --> 02:46.667
And we can
bring our brother home.

02:48.086 --> 02:51.008
A prisoner exchange? You can't.

02:51.760 --> 02:53.556
[Lawrence]
It won't be enough, you know.

02:53.722 --> 02:55.308
Whatever happens to him,

02:55.852 --> 02:57.104
won't be enough for you.

02:57.479 --> 03:00.277

Are we even in Gilead anymore?

Knowin' what's coming for her.

16:19.666 --> 16:21.085
[Tyler] You think
she'd beg for her life?

16:21.460 --> 16:23.214
Not if we cut out her tongue.

16:58.744 --> 16:59.996
I got something for you.

17:17.699 --> 17:18.867
I can get a lot more.

17:42.414 --> 17:43.499
[Vicky] Can I see one?

17:46.339 --> 17:47.967
Do you think Nick
can get her to the border?

17:48.719 --> 17:50.388
-What, your mistress?
-Yeah.

17:51.140 --> 17:53.520
Yeah.
Mrs. Fucking Radcliffe, yeah.

17:54.063 --> 17:54.898
[Vicky] Could he?

17:56.985 --> 17:57.945
[June] I don't know.

18:00.158 --> 18:01.243
I wouldn't think so.

18:02.245 --> 18:03.373
Why not? He's an Eye.

18:04.249 --> 18:06.671
He can't just arrest a Wife
and drag her to the border.

18:06.922 --> 18:07.965
[Vicky] Why not?

18:10.846 --> 18:12.642
We can get across, though.
Right?

18:13.142 --> 18:15.898
There are hundreds of ways in.
Getting in isn't hard.

18:17.359 --> 18:19.739
You want to go back into Gilead
and kill a Wife?

18:20.741 --> 18:21.743
[Danielle] Maybe not kill.

18:22.787 --> 18:24.666
I think I just want to
take some time with her.

18:25.793 --> 18:26.753
You know?

18:27.295 --> 18:29.592
Do unto others
as they have done unto you.

18:31.888 --> 18:33.141
That's not what the Bible says.

18:33.684 --> 18:35.019
Well, that's what my Bible says.

18:41.031 --> 18:42.033
[clears throat]

18:42.577 --> 18:43.494
Uh...

18:44.413 --> 18:45.373
Where's Emily?

18:47.754 --> 18:48.589
She's not here.

18:49.758 --> 18:50.885
But we're here.

18:52.429 --> 18:53.640
What are we gonna do?

18:54.684 --> 18:56.605
We all went
to the woods for you, June.

18:57.022 --> 18:58.357
That was to kill Fred.

18:58.734 --> 19:00.153
He had to pay for what he did.

19:01.197 --> 19:03.075
[Danielle] He was your monster.

19:04.119 --> 19:06.708
And we tore him apart for you.

19:07.794 --> 19:09.004
Now it is my turn!

19:14.557 --> 19:16.310
So, you're going
to leave your family?

19:17.855 --> 19:19.274
You're going
to leave your husband?

19:19.567 --> 19:21.362
-[woman] Jesus.
-Shut up.

19:21.530 --> 19:22.740
[June]
So you're gonna go all that way,

19:22.990 --> 19:24.201
what, to just get caught

19:24.744 --> 19:26.790
somewhere between here
and Philadelphia?

19:26.873 --> 19:28.502
Shut up.

19:28.794 --> 19:30.548
You won't get anywhere
near your old posting.

19:31.173 --> 19:34.012
You know
what they do to spies, Danielle.

19:34.137 --> 19:35.181
They crucify them.

19:35.265 --> 19:38.062
They hang them
on fucking telephone poles.

19:38.145 --> 19:39.106
Shut up, June.

19:39.356 --> 19:40.776
-[woman] Oh, Jesus.
-[Danielle] Vicky.

19:43.197 --> 19:45.536
She was here for you,
are you here for her?

19:46.705 --> 19:47.957
Are you here for any of us?

20:00.356 --> 20:01.610
I don't know, Vicky.

20:07.705 --> 20:08.874
[gunshots]

20:09.499 --> 20:10.836
Go. Go.

20:11.420 --> 20:12.798
You made your choice
in the woods.

20:12.882 --> 20:14.426
Now you're just
a fucking coward!

20:17.223 --> 20:18.184
Fuck.

20:19.687 --> 20:20.939
[car engines starting]

21:10.664 --> 21:11.666
Mrs. Waterford.

21:21.101 --> 21:22.353
May we have a moment, please?

21:34.796 --> 21:37.091
I'd like to see
my husband's remains.

21:40.264 --> 21:41.643
I'll have to see
if that's possible.

21:41.810 --> 21:43.229
I just lost him!

21:43.522 --> 21:45.441
Do you people
have any decency at all,

21:45.609 --> 21:46.736
any scintilla of grace?

21:47.655 --> 21:48.489
Where were you?

21:50.243 --> 21:51.746
Did something happen
to Fred's plane?

21:53.542 --> 21:54.417
No.

21:56.673 --> 21:59.637
There was a change in
Commander Waterford's itinerary.

22:01.558 --> 22:03.102
He wasn't on his way to Geneva.

22:05.566 --> 22:06.526
Where was he?

22:10.993 --> 22:12.245
The United States government

22:13.163 --> 22:15.752
made a deal
with the Gilead government.

22:17.506 --> 22:18.465
Last night,

22:20.219 --> 22:22.600
he was involved in a
prisoner exchange at the border.

22:24.394 --> 22:25.814
So you sent him back
to be killed.

22:26.733 --> 22:30.281
They agreed to try him under
the Gilead system of justice.

22:31.325 --> 22:32.536
I delivered him safely.

22:32.661 --> 22:35.876
I don't know what happened
to him after that.

22:36.001 --> 22:38.255
You know ex-- you knew exactly
what would happen to him.

22:38.339 --> 22:39.257
No. No--

22:39.341 --> 22:41.386
And I'm sure that you got your
30 pieces of silver, no doubt!

22:41.763 --> 22:44.560
I traded Fred
for 22 political prisoners,

22:46.480 --> 22:49.361
women your government sent
to die in the Colonies!

22:52.116 --> 22:54.789
My job right now
is to protect you and your baby.

22:54.872 --> 22:55.749
From whom?

22:57.001 --> 22:58.922
You are responsible
for Fred's death!

22:59.005 --> 23:00.968
Fuck's s-- Serena, do--

23:10.946 --> 23:14.160
Two things arrived
at the I.C.C. Detention Center

23:14.662 --> 23:17.584
in an envelope
addressed to you this morning.

23:38.208 --> 23:39.252
It's his wedding ring.

23:43.385 --> 23:46.601
Serena, they also sent a finger.

23:46.768 --> 23:47.770
A severed...

23:49.774 --> 23:50.692
finger.

24:09.980 --> 24:12.443
We've seen this kind of threat
from Gilead before.

24:14.489 --> 24:16.536
Do you have any idea
what it could mean?

24:22.798 --> 24:24.092
Which finger was it?

24:26.221 --> 24:28.685
His ring finger.
Left ring finger.

24:43.380 --> 24:44.592
This wasn't Gilead.

24:48.808 --> 24:49.935
How do you know that?

24:53.943 --> 24:55.362
Because it was June Osborn.

24:59.663 --> 25:00.874
It's not possible.

25:02.335 --> 25:03.630
You don't know what she is.

25:21.164 --> 25:22.876
June. June.

25:25.005 --> 25:25.966
Hey.

25:26.424 --> 25:28.178
Uh, sorry, uh, is Emily up?

25:30.307 --> 25:33.146
Uh, no, she's not here.

25:35.777 --> 25:36.988
Okay. Do you know where she is?

25:38.908 --> 25:40.327
She went back to Gilead.

25:47.174 --> 25:48.343
She went back

25:48.636 --> 25:50.222
to fight, I think.

25:51.182 --> 25:52.811
To find Aunt Lydia if she can.

25:55.399 --> 25:56.777
It's what she needed to do.

25:59.282 --> 26:02.246
What did you say?
Did you talk to her?

26:03.123 --> 26:04.585
Yes, she called.

26:05.712 --> 26:06.756
She said goodbye.

26:07.841 --> 26:11.264
I wanted to wake Oliver up,
but she said no.

26:12.016 --> 26:15.064
I don't know...
I don't know why she'd say no.

26:21.702 --> 26:23.205
-I can find her.
-June...

26:23.372 --> 26:24.875
No, I can fix this.

26:25.125 --> 26:26.378
June, shut the fuck up!

26:28.675 --> 26:29.676
She's gone.

26:30.260 --> 26:31.680
I'm never gonna see her again.

26:31.931 --> 26:34.687
Oliver is
never gonna see her again.

26:43.746 --> 26:44.873
It's my fault.

26:47.002 --> 26:47.838
I don't care.

26:49.257 --> 26:50.175
I don't care.

26:51.469 --> 26:52.430
She's gone.

26:53.390 --> 26:55.436
I don't need it
to be someone's fault.

26:57.481 --> 26:59.485
I mean, why does it matter
whose fault it is?

26:59.945 --> 27:01.574
So I can hate the right person?

27:01.782 --> 27:03.076
So I can hate you?

27:03.703 --> 27:04.830
What good is that?

27:06.166 --> 27:09.422
Oliver and I are gonna be happy
with the time we had with her.

27:12.052 --> 27:13.931
She w-- she was gone,

27:15.560 --> 27:16.812
and then she was here.

27:18.900 --> 27:20.820
It's more time than
I ever thought I'd get.

27:22.741 --> 27:24.118
We're lucky in a lot of ways.

27:27.792 --> 27:29.838
If you hear from her,
will you tell me?

27:33.011 --> 27:33.930
No.

27:38.063 --> 27:39.106
Goodbye, June.

27:48.291 --> 27:49.503
[door closes]

28:17.349 --> 28:18.894
[breathing heavily]

29:16.552 --> 29:17.846
[ducks quacking]

30:29.029 --> 30:30.365
[Hannah giggles]

30:48.192 --> 30:49.278
[sobbing]

30:53.871 --> 30:54.956
[officer Margeaux] Ma'am.

30:57.044 --> 30:58.004
Ma'am?

30:59.256 --> 31:00.342
Are you okay?

31:03.264 --> 31:04.643
Are you all right, ma'am?

31:19.088 --> 31:20.215
[sirens wailing in distance]

31:32.907 --> 31:33.993
[indistinct radio chatter]

31:35.120 --> 31:35.997
[Luke] Hey.

31:37.374 --> 31:38.209
You're all right.

31:40.005 --> 31:40.923
You all right?

31:42.217 --> 31:43.052
Yeah.

31:44.848 --> 31:46.434
-I'm sorry.
-June, you don't--

31:48.021 --> 31:50.233
No, I mean, you were fine.

31:52.154 --> 31:52.989
You're fine.

31:53.072 --> 31:54.659
You had Nichole, you had Moira,

31:55.911 --> 31:56.913
I just blew it all up.

31:58.082 --> 31:59.627
I'm ruining your fucking life.

32:00.045 --> 32:01.631
[laughs] June...

32:02.550 --> 32:04.554
-you are my fucking life.
-[chuckles]

32:04.763 --> 32:06.641
-So...
-[laughs]

32:09.146 --> 32:10.190
Emily went back.

32:14.616 --> 32:17.997
To Gilead.
To find Lydia, I think,

32:18.081 --> 32:19.918
or anyone
she can get her hands on.

32:20.251 --> 32:22.799
And she just left Sylvia
and left Oliver.

32:22.882 --> 32:23.717
I know.

32:25.930 --> 32:26.973
She went all in.

32:28.226 --> 32:29.478
Which is insane.

32:30.230 --> 32:31.148
Yeah.

32:33.737 --> 32:34.906
I get it though.

32:37.327 --> 32:38.539
I do. I feel it.

32:40.250 --> 32:41.335
Gilead, pulling?

32:43.674 --> 32:44.634
Don't you?

32:45.093 --> 32:46.596
[sighs] You know, I, um...

32:49.059 --> 32:50.228
yeah, y'know, I, uh,

32:54.153 --> 32:55.196
I feel Hannah.

32:58.202 --> 33:01.250
You know, and I felt you.
I felt you so much

33:01.333 --> 33:02.545
that sometimes
I couldn't breathe.

33:05.049 --> 33:06.302
But I got you back now.

33:08.472 --> 33:09.851
Come on, June. Let's go.

33:11.312 --> 33:14.401
No. You, you, you don't want me
around Nichole.

33:14.736 --> 33:17.032
You what--
you did nothing wrong.

33:17.490 --> 33:19.369
Did nothing wrong. All right?

33:19.746 --> 33:20.998
He got what he deserved.

33:21.457 --> 33:23.377
Yeah, but, you,
you, you didn't see.

33:25.758 --> 33:28.346
You didn't see
what we did to him.

33:31.268 --> 33:32.145
If you did--

33:33.189 --> 33:34.149
You can't understand.

33:34.233 --> 33:36.613
No, Ju-- don't tell me
I don't understand.

33:36.696 --> 33:39.034
-'Kay.
-Don't, I, I, I get it.

33:44.419 --> 33:45.589
You know, I loved it.

33:49.681 --> 33:51.016
I loved it.

33:54.231 --> 33:55.818
You don't think
I'd understand that?

33:56.360 --> 33:57.780
-You don't think I wanna--
-[door opens]

33:57.863 --> 33:59.867
All right, come on, June,
let's just get outta here.

33:59.951 --> 34:00.786
[constable] Okay, then.

34:01.453 --> 34:02.414
You can follow me.

34:05.211 --> 34:06.380
I need to do something.

34:07.465 --> 34:09.136
-What, what's going on?
-Listen to me.

34:09.679 --> 34:11.181
I can't wait.

34:11.473 --> 34:15.607
I can't wait for the boots
on the stairs. Okay?

34:15.899 --> 34:16.776
What did you do?

34:16.860 --> 34:19.574
I cannot live like that.
I'm sorry.

34:19.657 --> 34:21.327
[constable] You sure you don't
just wanna go home?

34:21.410 --> 34:22.913
I killed Commander Waterford,
and I'll swear to it.

34:22.997 --> 34:23.832
[constable] No, you said--

34:23.915 --> 34:25.084
She doesn't know
what she's talking about.

34:25.168 --> 34:26.588
Come on, let's go.
I'm taking you home.

34:26.671 --> 34:27.757
[June] Sir! Listen to me.

34:27.840 --> 34:29.009
I need to do this.

34:29.301 --> 34:30.721
No, you don't have
to live like this.

34:30.804 --> 34:31.973
We'll take off.
We'll go to Hawaii, okay?

34:32.057 --> 34:32.933
[woman]
Miss, you're gonna have--

34:33.017 --> 34:33.977
-We'll go with Nichole.
-Step back.

34:34.061 --> 34:35.355
I just need to talk
to my wife for a second.

34:35.438 --> 34:36.900
-Sir!
-[June] It's gonna be okay.

34:36.983 --> 34:37.818
It's okay.

34:37.902 --> 34:39.237
[constable] Do you have counsel,
by any chance?

34:39.321 --> 34:40.616
-Do you have any weapons?
-[June] No.

34:41.241 --> 34:42.243
Come on back.

34:42.410 --> 34:43.997
-[June] Get a lawyer.
-June, don't do this.

34:44.081 --> 34:45.667
Call Moira. She'll have someone.

34:45.918 --> 34:47.546
Fuck you! Don't do this!

34:48.130 --> 34:49.091
Fuck you.

34:50.176 --> 34:51.971
[June] I followed
Commander Waterford

34:52.055 --> 34:53.600
into the forest by myself.

34:55.353 --> 34:56.940
I was alone when I chased him.

34:57.608 --> 34:58.860
[female officer]
You can put your arms down.

35:00.029 --> 35:01.574
[June]
He ran and tried to escape...

35:01.700 --> 35:02.660
[female officer] Turn to me.

35:02.785 --> 35:04.705
Open your mouth.
Put your tongue up to the top.

35:04.789 --> 35:05.708
[June] But I caught him.

35:06.709 --> 35:10.759
I hit him and kicked him
and bit him.

35:13.932 --> 35:16.145
When he was dead,
I left him in the forest.

35:18.357 --> 35:21.531
[prosecutor] I take it you meant
to inflict harm on this man?

35:22.490 --> 35:24.369
Yes, ma'am. As much as possible.

35:26.081 --> 35:27.585
[prosecutor]
Could you tell me why?

35:28.252 --> 35:30.131
He raped me
and kept me prisoner.

35:31.843 --> 35:34.389
He was a monster
and he deserved to die.

35:35.517 --> 35:36.644
[prosecutor] I see.

35:36.936 --> 35:39.692
Society leaves
decisions like those

35:39.817 --> 35:42.113
to people like me, Ms. Osborn.

35:42.615 --> 35:43.950
Not our citizens,

35:44.034 --> 35:47.583
and certainly not refugee guests
in our country.

35:48.250 --> 35:49.461
I understand that.

35:50.589 --> 35:51.966
That's why I came here.

35:55.056 --> 35:55.974
I came myself.

35:58.813 --> 35:59.982
[prosecutor] You did.

36:03.824 --> 36:04.784
[prosecutor sighs]

36:05.284 --> 36:06.746
Unfortunately,

36:07.330 --> 36:09.585
as they say,
this is not my department.

36:11.129 --> 36:12.340
Maybe fortunately.

36:13.384 --> 36:15.388
These events
did not occur in Canada.

36:15.848 --> 36:17.810
It is not a concern
of the Crown.

36:31.461 --> 36:32.422
I killed him.

36:34.050 --> 36:35.554
[prosecutor] Be that as it may.

36:38.058 --> 36:39.937
We appreciate you coming in.

36:40.146 --> 36:41.398
Have a good night.

36:44.029 --> 36:46.158
There can't just be
no punishment.

36:48.913 --> 36:52.963
That is between you and your
deity of choice, Ms. Osborn.

36:54.550 --> 36:56.554
But the Crown
has no quarrel with you.

36:58.600 --> 36:59.560
You're free to go.

37:02.816 --> 37:04.570
[breath trembling]

37:08.160 --> 37:09.079
[door closes]

37:09.204 --> 37:10.582
[officer Margeaux]
There's also the finger.

37:12.460 --> 37:13.755
I'll be citing you for

37:14.297 --> 37:16.719
transporting an unsecured
biological sample.

37:17.554 --> 37:19.307
It's $88,
you can pay downstairs.

37:22.523 --> 37:23.525
Okay.

37:26.446 --> 37:29.202
Okay. I, I don't think
I have $88 on me.

37:30.204 --> 37:31.541
[officer Margeaux]
You can also pay online.

37:34.379 --> 37:35.256
So, have a good day.

37:36.926 --> 37:37.845
Be safe.

37:44.065 --> 37:45.109
[door closes]

37:58.260 --> 37:59.638
[indistinct chatter]

38:08.531 --> 38:09.575
[Luke] Come here.

38:10.326 --> 38:11.495
Come here, baby.

38:17.298 --> 38:18.843
[June] I have to pay a fine.

38:19.177 --> 38:20.262
Online.

39:05.854 --> 39:07.148
[gasps softly]

39:11.741 --> 39:13.327
[melancholy music playing]

39:34.452 --> 39:35.747
I am sorry for your loss.

39:39.713 --> 39:41.007
I would like to
formally petition

39:41.091 --> 39:42.260
to the Canadian government

39:42.636 --> 39:45.224
to reconsider their
capital punishment statutes,

39:48.188 --> 39:50.025
considering
that woman's heinous acts.

39:52.698 --> 39:54.450
[sighs] Mrs. Waterford,

39:55.996 --> 39:58.918
there won't be a Canadian
investigation into the matter.

40:00.296 --> 40:01.172
Why?

40:03.260 --> 40:04.722
What more evidence do they need?

40:05.055 --> 40:07.226
It seems the incident itself

40:07.686 --> 40:10.984
was committed
in a still-disputed territory

40:11.067 --> 40:13.280
between Gilead and Canada,

40:13.531 --> 40:16.286
a sort of, uh, No Man's Land.

40:17.455 --> 40:21.212
As such, June Osborn
hasn't broken any law.

40:24.385 --> 40:27.475
Mrs. Waterford, I encourage you
to focus on what happens next

40:27.559 --> 40:28.728
for you and your child.

40:31.107 --> 40:33.028
Once your charges
have been resolved

40:33.236 --> 40:37.621
you and your child can begin
a new life in Toronto.

40:37.913 --> 40:40.292
And how do I possibly feel safe?

40:41.127 --> 40:43.925
You can apply for asylum
as a refugee.

40:44.008 --> 40:46.179
There will be resources
to help you.

40:47.223 --> 40:48.433
You won't be alone, Serena.

40:49.185 --> 40:50.688
Are you going to protect me?

40:54.445 --> 40:55.280
Are you?

40:55.364 --> 40:56.867
Are you gonna
protect me like this?

40:58.120 --> 40:59.038
Hmm?

41:02.002 --> 41:04.090
Do you even know
what she is capable of?

41:05.259 --> 41:06.804
Well, then, you take
a good hard look

41:07.221 --> 41:10.269
at exactly
what she is capable of!

41:10.352 --> 41:11.647
[sobs]

41:12.649 --> 41:15.028
Because don't you dare tell me

41:15.572 --> 41:17.576
that you can
protect me from her!

41:27.261 --> 41:28.180
[door closes]

42:28.926 --> 42:30.805
[acolyte 1] We're praying for
your husband, Mrs. Waterford.

42:31.807 --> 42:32.934
We're praying for you.

42:36.316 --> 42:38.403
[acolyte 2]
God has him now. Rest his soul.

42:38.486 --> 42:39.488
Thank you.

42:43.038 --> 42:44.081
Under His eye.

42:44.916 --> 42:46.002
Under His eye.

42:55.646 --> 42:56.982
[acolyte 3]
We're with you, Serena.

43:00.740 --> 43:01.784
Thank you.

43:04.121 --> 43:05.415
[acolyte 4] God goes with you.

43:05.583 --> 43:06.752
[acolyte 5] God rest his soul.

43:07.127 --> 43:08.171
Praise be.

43:08.964 --> 43:10.008
[acolyte 6] Praise be.

43:14.893 --> 43:16.020
[acolyte 7] Bless you, Serena.

43:16.437 --> 43:17.439
Thank you.

43:18.943 --> 43:20.362
[acolyte 8]
God is here with you.

43:21.197 --> 43:22.575
[acolyte 9] Fred's in heaven.

43:28.169 --> 43:29.255
She's going back to detention.

43:33.096 --> 43:35.475
I'm sure
you're tired after today.

43:40.903 --> 43:42.949
I'm taking my husband home
to bury him.

43:47.584 --> 43:50.338
Home... to Gilead?

43:51.633 --> 43:54.472
I will see that the Commander
has a proper burial

43:56.392 --> 43:58.271
in the nation that he founded.

44:01.235 --> 44:02.989
The Waterford name has power,

44:06.120 --> 44:07.456
and that will be respected.

44:09.043 --> 44:10.212
And remembered.

44:13.719 --> 44:16.474
I can't imagine
that will be possible.

44:24.365 --> 44:25.450
Mr. Tuello,

44:27.371 --> 44:28.833
my husband was murdered,

44:31.547 --> 44:34.343
and I am asking to bury him.

44:37.976 --> 44:42.150
Any civilized country would
have the decency to allow it.

44:47.077 --> 44:48.079
Yes.

44:48.706 --> 44:51.753
I will make some calls,
Mrs. Waterford.

44:52.170 --> 44:53.841
Do whatever is necessary.

44:59.769 --> 45:00.688
[vehicle door closes]

45:04.613 --> 45:05.823
[vehicle drives away]

45:18.599 --> 45:19.517
[Luke sighs]

45:21.312 --> 45:22.481
I need a drink.

45:23.316 --> 45:24.276
Do you want a drink?

45:25.403 --> 45:26.405
Yeah, sure.

45:26.949 --> 45:28.953
All right.
I'm gonna get you a drink.

45:33.419 --> 45:36.217
Moira, have we got any of that,
uh, good red wine left?

45:36.300 --> 45:37.260
[Moira]
Uh, see that? Daddy's here.

45:37.344 --> 45:38.555
Hey. We got
any of that red wine--

45:38.639 --> 45:39.557
Yeah, it's uh...

45:39.849 --> 45:40.935
-It's, uh...
-[Luke] come on.

45:42.772 --> 45:44.441
-Come with me. Here you go.
-[Moira clears throat]

45:46.697 --> 45:47.573
Luke...

45:48.867 --> 45:49.828
how is she doing?

45:49.953 --> 45:51.288
Uh, yeah, she's fine.

45:53.627 --> 45:55.338
No, she's not-- she's not fine!

45:56.090 --> 45:57.134
Gilead would've killed Fred.

45:57.217 --> 45:59.054
She just wanted to do it
herself with her own hands.

45:59.806 --> 46:01.100
No, no, no. No, listen.

46:01.183 --> 46:02.979
She's here, right?
She's with us.

46:03.354 --> 46:04.649
I'm taking a fucking win.
All right?

46:04.733 --> 46:05.901
I'm taking a fucking win.

46:05.985 --> 46:08.197
So, take that to her.
We're celebrating.

46:08.866 --> 46:10.619
Go, go, go. Go, go, go, go, go.

46:26.192 --> 46:27.277
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

46:37.632 --> 46:39.468
Hey. Did you, uh,
hear about Emily?

46:41.472 --> 46:42.767
Um, yes.

46:43.685 --> 46:46.858
Um, uh, refugee services
and the Red Cross,

46:46.942 --> 46:48.529
they both have her name.
They're all along the border,

46:48.612 --> 46:51.325
so they'll be looking for her,
at least.

46:53.496 --> 46:56.335
They're not gonna be looking for
somebody going back into Gilead.

46:59.676 --> 47:00.594
No, they're not.

47:04.351 --> 47:05.353
Who would do that?

47:10.739 --> 47:11.575
It happens.

47:12.577 --> 47:13.537
More than you think.

47:14.873 --> 47:15.916
People are breakable.

47:24.016 --> 47:25.226
I gotta go give Nichole a bath.

47:26.646 --> 47:27.565
[June] I can do it.

47:31.740 --> 47:33.660
Please. I'd, I'd like to do it.

47:37.209 --> 47:38.712
June, I don't feel comfortable

47:38.795 --> 47:40.549
with you taking care
of Nichole right now.

47:43.179 --> 47:44.097
It scares me.

47:49.316 --> 47:50.276
'Kay.

47:52.657 --> 47:53.491
Me, too.

47:57.123 --> 47:58.084
You scare me.

48:03.469 --> 48:04.388
Me, too.

48:14.659 --> 48:16.412
I thought I'd be in jail.

48:19.836 --> 48:20.838
But you're not.

48:25.471 --> 48:26.306
No.

48:28.979 --> 48:29.939
I'm not.

48:34.031 --> 48:34.866
Bath.

48:36.493 --> 48:37.454
I love you.

48:43.466 --> 48:44.301
I love you, too.

48:52.358 --> 48:53.361
[knock on door]

48:57.118 --> 48:58.162
[Luke] What?

49:00.166 --> 49:01.085
[door closes]

49:02.462 --> 49:03.422
[footsteps approaching]

49:03.548 --> 49:04.509
[Luke] Hey.

49:05.343 --> 49:06.178
June?

49:19.121 --> 49:20.414
[Mark]
Ms. Osborn, good evening.

49:22.545 --> 49:23.505
[June] Good evening.

49:30.519 --> 49:31.646
Are you here to...

49:33.149 --> 49:35.654
arrest me or, or something?

49:37.490 --> 49:38.535
No, I'm not.

49:44.045 --> 49:45.256
I did hear that

49:46.466 --> 49:47.887
no charges will be brought.

49:48.805 --> 49:50.349
I imagine that's good news.

49:51.519 --> 49:52.437
I imagine.

49:55.944 --> 49:56.821
[June exhales]

50:00.787 --> 50:03.668
Sorry I kind of, uh, played you.

50:07.091 --> 50:08.093
All right.

50:14.649 --> 50:15.483
Um...

50:19.784 --> 50:21.078
so what did she say?

50:25.002 --> 50:26.463
When, uh, when she found out?

50:27.465 --> 50:28.425
About Fred.

50:31.933 --> 50:33.060
She was scared.

50:36.901 --> 50:37.987
Scared of me?

50:39.824 --> 50:40.701
[Mark] Yes.

50:44.332 --> 50:46.629
Scared can be very dangerous,
Ms. Osborn.

50:50.011 --> 50:52.098
She will always be dangerous.

50:58.360 --> 51:00.197
I think
you've scared Gilead as well.

51:01.701 --> 51:04.414
A Handmaid
killing her Commander. I'm...

51:05.249 --> 51:08.297
I don't think they'll be
able to let that stand.

51:12.388 --> 51:14.142
I'm sure you want to
get back to your family.

51:18.651 --> 51:19.570
Yeah.

51:26.500 --> 51:28.045
I just came to say, uh...

51:31.426 --> 51:32.428
well done.

51:35.184 --> 51:36.646
You did something terrible

51:38.190 --> 51:39.610
that needed to be done.

51:41.614 --> 51:43.033
I understand what that costs.

51:48.586 --> 51:50.172
May he rot in hell.

51:59.692 --> 52:00.694
Praise be.

52:06.037 --> 52:07.791
Don't let the bastards
grind you down.

52:25.994 --> 52:28.165
-[vehicle door closes]
-[vehicle drives away]

52:36.641 --> 52:37.851
[Nichole crying]

52:38.728 --> 52:40.105
[Moira talking indistinctly]

52:46.117 --> 52:46.994
Yeah.

52:47.704 --> 52:50.084
[gasps] Oh! Oh!

52:50.459 --> 52:51.378
What?

52:51.461 --> 52:52.923
[Luke] Aw, honey, I'm sorry.

52:54.760 --> 52:55.887
[Nichole continues crying]

52:57.014 --> 52:58.183
[Moira] This hand!

52:58.267 --> 52:59.352
[Luke] Hey, look who it is...

53:00.062 --> 53:02.734
Mommy. Yeah, Mommy

53:03.987 --> 53:04.947
Hi.

53:05.030 --> 53:06.617
[Luke] Do you want
to say hi to Mommy?

53:07.368 --> 53:08.328
Come on.

53:09.247 --> 53:10.457
[Nichole continues crying]

53:11.334 --> 53:12.253
[Moira] Is it Mommy?

53:12.671 --> 53:14.215
Is it Mommy?

53:14.382 --> 53:16.344
-[Luke] Yeah?
-[Moira] Oh, dear.

53:16.804 --> 53:17.723
[Luke] Come on.

53:19.560 --> 53:20.729
[Moira] This hand.

53:21.438 --> 53:22.816
[Luke]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

53:24.068 --> 53:25.029
[Nichole stops crying]

53:25.112 --> 53:26.323
[Moira] You're doing real good.

53:26.448 --> 53:27.701
Hey, no bath time?

53:29.120 --> 53:31.667
You don't have to have a bath,
if you don't want to.

53:31.792 --> 53:34.339
Okay? Okay.

53:43.440 --> 53:46.112
We're gonna bathe you
in kisses. How's that?

53:46.404 --> 53:47.448
How's that?

53:47.658 --> 53:48.910
We're gonna bathe you in kisses.

53:48.993 --> 53:50.120
-[Nichole cooing]
-Aww.

53:50.705 --> 53:51.916
[Moira shushing]

53:56.132 --> 53:58.930
It's okay, sweetheart.
It's okay.

54:06.654 --> 54:08.031
I got her, you guys.

54:13.668 --> 54:15.087
[Nichole coos]

54:30.910 --> 54:36.212
Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi.

54:39.093 --> 54:40.555
It's okay, sweetheart.
