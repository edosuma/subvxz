00:00.665 --> 00:03.300
Tonight on Ice Road Truckers.

00:03.302 --> 00:05.135
This ain't gonna be pretty.

00:05.137 --> 00:06.770
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

00:06.772 --> 00:10.307
With the load count
up for grabs...

00:10.309 --> 00:11.275
Hold on!

00:11.277 --> 00:13.210
Drivers push the limit.

00:13.212 --> 00:16.680
We're basically going from one floating
chunk of ice over to the other.

00:17.483 --> 00:21.418
- With bigger hauls...
- Anything can happen out here.

00:21.420 --> 00:26.690
- Deadlier roads... - Ain't
nobody else ever been where I'm going.

00:26.692 --> 00:29.660
You know, this could happen
to anybody out here.

00:29.662 --> 00:30.761
And thinner ice.

00:31.697 --> 00:33.764
The ice is just crack,
crack, crack, crack.

00:33.766 --> 00:35.966
Oh, fuck!

01:09.667 --> 01:14.204
At the Carlile yard
in Fairbanks, Alaska...

01:14.206 --> 01:15.939
I'm ready to make some money.

01:15.941 --> 01:17.073
Ronald "Porkchop"

01:17.075 --> 01:20.410
Mangum is desperate
to get on the Dalton.

01:20.511 --> 01:22.412
I'm up here for my
family, for the money.

01:22.414 --> 01:24.981
I'm up here so I can
buy my wife a house.

01:25.049 --> 01:29.586
I'm up here so I can take my kids
on vacation, so I can pay bills.

01:29.588 --> 01:32.589
My back's against
the wall, man.

01:32.591 --> 01:36.993
But so far, he hasn't been
allowed to drive the road on his own.

01:36.995 --> 01:38.895
What's up Marky Mark?

01:38.897 --> 01:40.697
Nothing, what's going
on with you, Porkchop?

01:40.699 --> 01:42.232
I'm just checking out
the funky bunch.

01:42.234 --> 01:43.400
What you got for me today?

01:43.402 --> 01:45.802
We have a run to Manley.

01:45.804 --> 01:46.603
Manley?

01:46.605 --> 01:48.338
Manley's a new run for Carlile.

01:48.439 --> 01:51.074
Um, pretty tricky road
up there in some areas.

01:51.076 --> 01:52.776
You got ice flows
over the road.

01:52.778 --> 01:53.777
Snow gets pretty deep.

01:53.844 --> 01:57.614
Just as bad as running
up to Prudhoe.

01:57.616 --> 02:02.886
And you're going by yourself.

02:02.888 --> 02:04.954
Hey, thank you, man.

02:04.956 --> 02:06.890
All right, Porkchop,
be careful out there.

02:06.892 --> 02:08.525
Porkchop's rolling, baby.

02:08.526 --> 02:11.895
For the first time
this season, Porkchop's hitting

02:11.897 --> 02:13.797
the road by himself.

02:13.799 --> 02:14.898
Pretty stoked today.

02:14.900 --> 02:16.266
Fixing to go up to Manley.

02:16.268 --> 02:17.634
Nobody else has been there.

02:17.636 --> 02:22.338
And his mission is
taking him to uncharted territory.

02:22.340 --> 02:24.240
You can't stop the Chop, baby.

02:24.242 --> 02:25.175
I'm back on top of my game.

02:25.177 --> 02:26.342
It's a good thing.

02:26.344 --> 02:27.377
I'm ready to do this.

02:27.379 --> 02:31.514
Every road's got to have
its first time traveled.

02:31.516 --> 02:34.884
Branching off the
Dalton, the road to Manley is

02:34.886 --> 02:41.491
over 120 miles of slick corners,
exposed peaks, and rugged

02:41.493 --> 02:42.992
Alaskan wilderness.

02:42.994 --> 02:49.632
Re-supplying the village will be
Porkchop's biggest test this season.

02:49.634 --> 02:51.901
Let's roll this sucker.

02:51.903 --> 02:54.738
Yeah, it's a challenge, but it's
a challenge I'm willing to step

02:54.740 --> 02:56.372
up and take.

02:58.276 --> 02:59.909
Now is when it's
my time to shine.

02:59.911 --> 03:02.212
I've always been
the black sheep.

03:02.214 --> 03:08.718
It's my turn to show
that I'm a success too.

03:08.720 --> 03:12.722
- Just outside of Fairbanks...
- This will be the biggest load

03:12.724 --> 03:14.057
I've ever pushed.

03:14.059 --> 03:16.626
Another rookie's
getting the shot he's been

03:16.628 --> 03:20.730
looking for all season.

03:20.732 --> 03:22.599
It's gonna be awesome.

03:22.601 --> 03:22.632
It's gonna be awesome.

03:22.666 --> 03:25.101
I've never carried anything this
big up the Dalton, or pushed

03:25.103 --> 03:27.070
anything up the Dalton this big.

03:27.072 --> 03:27.137
Anything up the Dalton this big.

03:27.171 --> 03:29.672
Austin Wheeler's
still struggling to prove

03:29.674 --> 03:31.508
himself on the haul road.

03:31.510 --> 03:35.812
But today, he's finally been given the
chance to join a heavy-haul team.

03:35.814 --> 03:38.648
This season, I want to get the
respect of other drivers.

03:38.650 --> 03:39.983
That's my number one goal.

03:39.985 --> 03:42.352
And the way to do that is to be
able to come up here and take

03:42.354 --> 03:45.889
over the Dalton highway
as a heavy-haul driver.

03:45.891 --> 03:48.825
The load is a 100-ton
modular building that's

03:48.827 --> 03:52.695
desperately needed
in Prudhoe Bay.

03:55.132 --> 03:59.435
And Carlile's agreed to
get it there in just 72 hours.

03:59.437 --> 04:06.176
But with a top speed of 25 miles per
hour, they'll need every second.

04:06.178 --> 04:07.744
Ready to ride.

04:07.746 --> 04:10.747
On the team with
Austin are Carlile legend

04:10.749 --> 04:15.718
Carey Hall and Greg Vance.

04:30.601 --> 04:35.271
But with a load this massive...

04:35.273 --> 04:37.574
He's in the ditch.

04:37.576 --> 04:42.645
Just getting on
the road is a challenge.

04:42.647 --> 04:45.748
So the load kind of went over
the ditch as the rear of the

04:45.750 --> 04:50.086
trailer came out
of the driveway.

04:53.791 --> 04:55.792
Just got to steer the back of the
trailer to get it out on the

04:55.794 --> 04:58.027
road without dragging
through the ditch.

05:00.298 --> 05:04.133
Like a 100-ton RC
car, the trailer wheels can

05:04.135 --> 05:07.003
be adjusted by remote control.

05:07.005 --> 05:07.871
Got the remote?

05:07.873 --> 05:10.173
He's just gonna walk by the
trailer and steer it right out--

05:10.175 --> 05:13.476
Steer the back end out
on the road for me.

05:13.478 --> 05:15.211
And we'll hook it back up.

05:15.213 --> 05:21.317
Once it gets straightened out,
and we'll be on our way.

05:24.122 --> 05:24.787
Thanks, Greg.

05:24.789 --> 05:25.588
Thanks, Austin.

05:25.590 --> 05:28.658
Yeah.

05:28.660 --> 05:31.661
Here we go.

05:36.901 --> 05:39.802
The strict delivery
deadline means every delay is a

05:39.804 --> 05:42.872
chance the mission
could end in failure.

05:42.973 --> 05:46.976
But we got three days of hard
driving just to get there.

05:47.077 --> 05:51.247
And with the entire
500-mile journey still ahead,

05:51.249 --> 05:55.318
Austin's shot at proving himself
as a heavy-hauler is ticking away.

05:55.320 --> 05:58.254
The setbacks kind of suck, but
that stuff happens when you

05:58.256 --> 05:59.789
work heavy-haul.

05:59.791 --> 06:04.027
Anything can happen out here.

06:04.029 --> 06:12.235
- 450 miles to the east...
- We're gonna drive 500 miles today.

06:12.237 --> 06:17.240
Alex Debogorski is facing
the notorious Dempster, in reverse.

06:20.411 --> 06:24.247
I'm leaving Inuvik, going to
Dawson City, good lord willing,

06:24.249 --> 06:29.953
and, uh... hopefully we
don't have any problems.

06:30.020 --> 06:32.989
He's running south
with a trailer full of personal

06:32.991 --> 06:37.894
shipments and other goods being sent
out of the northern communities.

06:37.896 --> 06:38.895
Up, up and away.

06:38.897 --> 06:43.232
Here we go.

06:43.234 --> 06:46.302
And what's usually the
last challenge of the trip

06:46.304 --> 06:51.140
is the first up today.

06:51.142 --> 06:56.546
I'm approaching the Mackenzie
River ice crossing.

07:00.684 --> 07:05.154
They've lowered
the speed limits.

07:05.222 --> 07:07.724
Generally, when they lower the
speed limits, it's because

07:07.726 --> 07:09.792
there's a problem with the ice.

07:09.893 --> 07:17.200
So maybe the ice is getting
thinner... weaker to some degree.

07:17.267 --> 07:22.105
Fragile ice is no
place for a 48,000-pound rig.

07:25.709 --> 07:28.644
I'm just gonna take a walk
down there, take a look.

07:28.646 --> 07:32.015
See what it feels
like under my foot.

07:48.232 --> 07:50.266
Looks fine.

07:50.334 --> 07:55.438
There's no overflow.

07:55.440 --> 07:58.441
So nothing's sunk through it.

08:03.480 --> 08:04.981
Far as I'm concerned, it's safe.

08:04.983 --> 08:07.984
So I'm gonna go across.

08:30.642 --> 08:36.179
On the river... the key
to survival is a slow and steady pace.

09:07.077 --> 09:11.047
If I go too fast for the ice,
then I damage the ice.

09:11.049 --> 09:14.283
The damage for myself, getting
the trailer going first, or I

09:14.285 --> 09:18.221
can go into the drink.

09:41.713 --> 09:44.147
What's that?

09:49.586 --> 09:51.521
It's cracking.

09:51.523 --> 09:54.690
- Coming up...
- Just something's got me sick.

09:54.692 --> 09:56.759
Hugh's desperate gamble.

09:56.761 --> 09:59.128
We're driving right
into a blizzard.

09:59.130 --> 10:02.598
And the deadly
Dalton claims another victim.

10:02.600 --> 10:04.200
It's something that happens
up here, and it's really

10:04.202 --> 10:05.902
something you've got
to think about.

10:10.871 --> 10:16.442
In the middle of the frozen
Mackenzie River...

10:16.444 --> 10:17.443
What's that?

10:21.415 --> 10:23.983
Can't be too careful.

10:24.051 --> 10:29.021
The ice has Alex ready to jump.

10:33.727 --> 10:37.263
The veteran rides with an
open door, ready to leap to

10:37.265 --> 10:39.832
safety at a moment's notice.

10:39.834 --> 10:41.467
Whoa!

10:41.469 --> 10:44.036
And those few seconds
can be the difference

10:44.038 --> 10:49.375
between life and sudden death.

11:04.358 --> 11:08.628
Near the end of the crossing
Alex finally takes a seat.

11:17.838 --> 11:19.572
We got 'er. We made it.

11:19.574 --> 11:23.776
We're gonna live another day.

11:23.877 --> 11:26.045
And we're gonna go make time.

11:26.047 --> 11:28.848
I got this little time-making
machine in my back pocket, and

11:28.850 --> 11:35.955
we're just gonna crank
it up, crank it out.

11:36.023 --> 11:43.195
1,700 miles to the southeast,
in Winnipeg, Canada...

11:43.230 --> 11:46.832
Hugh Rowland and Rick Yemm's
season has hit rock bottom.

11:46.834 --> 11:47.500
Hey, man.

11:47.502 --> 11:48.567
How's it going?

11:48.569 --> 11:49.235
Not bad, and you?

11:49.237 --> 11:54.307
Mm, I'm a little bit better, but not
quite-- Not quite on the ball yet.

11:55.510 --> 11:57.843
Rick's been
sidelined by an infection he

11:57.845 --> 12:00.579
caught from his
mouse-infested truck.

12:00.581 --> 12:03.049
We gotta make sure
nobody goes in there.

12:03.051 --> 12:08.421
And there's a chance he
may have the deadly hantavirus.

12:08.423 --> 12:12.325
No, they don't know what the
fuck it is, huh, yet.

12:12.426 --> 12:16.028
They said if it's not
incubated by five days, then

12:16.030 --> 12:19.999
it's just something's got
me sick, right, so...

12:20.001 --> 12:22.568
Well, at least they figured out
it was something in the truck.

12:22.636 --> 12:24.136
Yep.

12:29.276 --> 12:31.544
Well, I'm gonna head out
there right away and-- So,

12:31.546 --> 12:34.146
they're probably wondering-- I
stopped to see what-- See what

12:34.148 --> 12:36.582
you were up to, see-- They'll
probably be asking how you're

12:36.584 --> 12:38.250
doing, so I thought
I'd better pop over.

12:38.252 --> 12:39.251
I'm still alive.

12:39.253 --> 12:40.152
See what's up.

12:40.154 --> 12:46.125
Yep.

12:46.127 --> 12:46.792
All right, man.

12:46.794 --> 12:47.593
I'll talk to you after a bit.

12:47.595 --> 12:48.260
Okay.

12:48.262 --> 12:52.898
Okay.

12:52.900 --> 12:55.468
When I first heard the news that
he was sick, and he had this

12:55.470 --> 13:00.339
horrible virus from the truck,
I felt pretty bad for him.

13:00.341 --> 13:04.710
But regardless, I'm still driving
and still trying to run

13:04.712 --> 13:08.581
the show, and trying to make everything
work, make-- make ends meet here.

13:08.583 --> 13:11.484
See if Mark can handle the fucking
office while our guy's gone.

13:11.486 --> 13:14.787
This season, Hugh's
sharing in company profits,

13:14.789 --> 13:19.925
but so far the brutal winter hasn't
left much profit on the books.

13:19.927 --> 13:22.294
I'll take this one
up real quick.

13:22.296 --> 13:25.097
All he can do is
hook up to another load and

13:25.099 --> 13:26.999
keep the freight moving.

13:27.001 --> 13:30.536
Well, I got, uh, a
load of septic tanks.

13:30.538 --> 13:32.705
Nice quick trip, I'm just gonna
take her up to Bloodvein, and

13:32.707 --> 13:36.075
that's as far as it's gotta go, so...
Day trip, I'll be back tonight.

13:36.077 --> 13:38.444
It'll be good.

13:38.446 --> 13:42.782
The run to Bloodvein
may be short, but to

13:42.784 --> 13:49.288
get there, Hugh will face the recently
opened Lake Winnipeg ice crossing.

13:51.125 --> 13:58.297
Over 9,000 square miles, and 118
feet deep, Lake Winnipeg is the

13:58.299 --> 14:04.403
11th largest freshwater lake on
Earth, and Hugh will be crossing

14:04.405 --> 14:07.606
against an oncoming
Arctic storm.

14:07.608 --> 14:10.075
We, uh, just got out of dodge,
there, and we're driving

14:10.077 --> 14:11.977
right into a blizzard.

14:11.979 --> 14:12.778
The wind's coming up.

14:12.780 --> 14:17.149
She's getting to be a real
fucking day out here.

14:18.485 --> 14:24.156
- 2,000 miles to the northwest...
- We got a load of sheetrock

14:24.158 --> 14:24.790
out here.

14:24.792 --> 14:25.624
All right, cool.

14:25.725 --> 14:26.692
That'll work.

14:26.694 --> 14:30.529
See you later.

14:30.531 --> 14:35.801
Darrell Ward is one trip
away from leading the load count.

14:35.803 --> 14:39.905
And with biggest competitor Jack
Jessee missing, he's out to

14:39.907 --> 14:41.440
be the new haul road ace.

14:41.442 --> 14:42.708
Jack disappeared.

14:42.809 --> 14:46.045
You know, with Jack being gone,
that gives me the advantage to

14:46.047 --> 14:47.146
get in the lead.

14:47.148 --> 14:50.082
I'm not gonna pass up an
advantage like that, you know?

14:50.084 --> 14:50.115
Advantage like that, you know?

14:50.150 --> 14:53.719
Jack's gone, man.
I'm gonna hammer down.

14:53.721 --> 14:55.688
We'll get 'er on the road.

14:55.690 --> 14:59.391
But taking the lead
in the load count isn't only

14:59.393 --> 15:01.894
about being the best.

15:01.896 --> 15:04.263
Picture of Reno.

15:04.265 --> 15:05.698
Senior in high
school, you know.

15:05.700 --> 15:11.637
So I'm gonna put
his picture up.

15:11.639 --> 15:13.639
You know, I came up here
to do this for Reno.

15:13.641 --> 15:17.076
You know, his-- his comfort is
very important to me, you know?

15:17.078 --> 15:25.618
I miss him a lot, and, uh--
Anything I do, I do for him.

15:28.622 --> 15:32.925
- A few miles up the road...
- Okay, Austin, I'm on there.

15:33.026 --> 15:35.361
All right, here we come.

15:35.363 --> 15:38.197
Austin Wheeler is
trying to prove himself as part

15:38.199 --> 15:41.734
of a three-man heavy-haul team.

15:41.801 --> 15:43.636
What do you got for RPM
right now?

15:43.638 --> 15:47.606
Uh, 1,600, fifth direct.

15:47.608 --> 15:49.742
Okay, we're gonna roll that way.

15:49.744 --> 15:49.775
Way.

15:49.809 --> 15:52.511
They gotta get the
100-ton load to Prudhoe Bay

15:52.513 --> 15:57.016
within 72 hours, but they spent
the morning just getting on the

15:57.018 --> 16:00.119
road, and they haven't even
made it to the Dalton.

16:00.121 --> 16:01.820
It takes a good team to do this.

16:01.822 --> 16:04.757
Just, all being smooth,
all talking on the radio.

16:04.759 --> 16:08.460
We all want to be at the same
RPM, same speed, all pushing

16:08.462 --> 16:11.664
at the same flow up the hill.

16:17.137 --> 16:19.939
The load's so
heavy it takes two trucks

16:19.941 --> 16:22.908
to push the lead truck
up any incline.

16:22.976 --> 16:24.510
What gear are you in?

16:24.512 --> 16:25.811
Fifth direct.

16:25.813 --> 16:27.813
You and I matched even.

16:27.815 --> 16:27.880
You and I matched even.

16:27.914 --> 16:29.448
Okay.

16:29.450 --> 16:32.217
And these early hills
are a trial run to see if

16:32.219 --> 16:33.986
Austin's got the hang of it.

16:59.880 --> 17:04.450
Hey, Carey.

17:04.550 --> 17:05.284
Yeah.

17:05.286 --> 17:06.652
I've got a bad brake can.

17:06.654 --> 17:09.821
It's leaking.

17:09.824 --> 17:12.491
Oh, that's not good.

17:12.492 --> 17:14.326
Stop up the road here somewhere.

17:14.328 --> 17:16.962
Yeah, we need to run up
to this parking lot.

17:16.964 --> 17:20.332
The brakes are
failing on Greg's push-truck,

17:20.334 --> 17:26.405
and the convoy hits their
second delay of the day.

17:29.643 --> 17:32.878
Can you call and tell the shop we
need a brake can for Greg's truck?

17:32.880 --> 17:34.146
You need a brake can?

17:34.247 --> 17:35.047
Yeah.

17:35.049 --> 17:36.115
10-4.

17:36.117 --> 17:38.784
We were doing pretty good until
this, uh, brake can came

17:38.786 --> 17:42.221
up, but, um, we need Greg.

17:42.223 --> 17:44.590
It's really hard to say what
time we'll get to Coldfoot.

17:44.592 --> 17:49.762
Depends, but I'm guessing
probably late tonight, and I'm

17:49.764 --> 17:52.364
not really happy about it.

17:52.366 --> 17:57.569
There's over 480 miles
to go, and the clock's ticking.

17:57.571 --> 18:05.310
Austin's chance to prove
himself may already be over.

18:05.312 --> 18:08.580
- Coming up... - The ice just
crack, crack, crack, crack.

18:08.582 --> 18:10.416
The Polar Bear
feels the pressure.

18:12.586 --> 18:14.386
Holy fuck!

18:18.097 --> 18:22.634
- Only 18 miles outside of
Fairbanks... - Gotta wait here until the

18:22.636 --> 18:26.038
mechanics come to fix the
brake can on Greg's truck.

18:26.040 --> 18:30.576
Austin Wheeler's shot at
heavy-haul glory is at a standstill.

18:30.643 --> 18:34.680
Just waiting for the mechanic to show
up before we can take off again.

18:34.682 --> 18:36.114
Hopefully it won't be too long.

18:36.116 --> 18:38.984
Can't really afford it,
but it is what it is.

18:38.986 --> 18:42.154
Things happen. Things go wrong,
and they break, you know?

18:42.156 --> 18:44.756
The team's chance to
deliver before the deadline

18:44.758 --> 18:47.159
expires is slipping away.

18:47.161 --> 18:51.797
We've lost a lot of time today,
though, that's for sure.

18:51.865 --> 18:54.299
Finally, the mechanic
arrives, to swap out a

18:54.301 --> 18:57.536
piece of the brake system.

18:57.538 --> 19:00.806
Oh, here we go.

19:00.808 --> 19:03.809
This brake can is no good.

19:03.811 --> 19:06.445
It was leaking air.

19:10.416 --> 19:13.452
The mechanic makes
quick work of the problem.

19:13.454 --> 19:14.152
Good to go!

19:16.155 --> 19:17.456
We should be good
to go after that.

19:17.458 --> 19:19.725
No more breakdowns.

19:19.826 --> 19:22.995
But they've barely
started the journey, and they're

19:22.997 --> 19:25.697
already running out of time.

19:25.699 --> 19:28.634
Probably lost seven or
eight hours so far.

19:28.636 --> 19:30.702
It's not the greatest of times.

19:30.704 --> 19:34.907
Probably be pushing
through the dark tonight.

19:41.915 --> 19:46.351
- 60 miles to the north...
- It's kind of nice.

19:46.353 --> 19:49.354
I'm finally on my freakin' own.

19:49.356 --> 19:51.690
Porkchop is in the
middle of his last shot at

19:51.692 --> 19:54.259
proving he belongs
on the haul road.

19:54.261 --> 19:57.529
I finally get my own load,
I'm doin' my own thing.

19:57.531 --> 19:58.630
I'm excited.

19:58.731 --> 20:01.133
On the bad side, I gotta leave
the dog, but on the good side,

20:01.135 --> 20:05.170
ain't nobody else ever
been where I'm going.

20:05.238 --> 20:08.040
He's headed to the
Alaskan village of Manley on his

20:08.042 --> 20:12.010
first solo run out of town.

20:12.012 --> 20:13.812
This is the road less traveled.

20:13.814 --> 20:18.016
And the trip is taking
him into unfamiliar territory.

20:18.018 --> 20:20.919
I'm whatever it takes to get this
load to these people out here.

20:20.921 --> 20:23.121
They're depending
on me right now.

20:23.123 --> 20:27.659
Over 120 miles long,
the rarely traveled access

20:27.661 --> 20:30.729
road wasn't built with
big rigs in mind.

20:30.731 --> 20:34.066
It's a washboard road where
it is cleared, it's

20:34.068 --> 20:36.668
rougher than a night in jail.

20:36.670 --> 20:40.939
This ain't gonna be pretty.

20:46.679 --> 20:51.850
Can't even see the
bottom down there.

20:51.852 --> 20:56.722
One side, you got about a
500-foot drop, the other side

20:56.724 --> 20:58.090
you got a mountain.

20:58.092 --> 21:03.595
Which side do you
want to go off of?

21:03.597 --> 21:09.034
Whoa, we are right on the edge.

21:09.036 --> 21:11.737
Well, I'm just trying
to pay attention.

21:11.739 --> 21:15.674
Definitely gotta be brave,
that's for damn sure.

21:15.676 --> 21:21.213
- Alone in the Alaskan wilderness...
- It's slicker than crisco on a

21:21.215 --> 21:23.081
cookie sheet.

21:23.083 --> 21:28.453
One mistake could be fatal.

21:32.291 --> 21:35.360
Hold on, we gotta slow down.

21:35.362 --> 21:38.730
Oh, fuck!

21:38.732 --> 21:43.435
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

21:49.509 --> 21:54.846
That was tricky.

21:57.784 --> 21:59.451
That was close.

21:59.453 --> 22:01.386
Lots of curves up here.

22:01.388 --> 22:08.226
This ain't no joke,
that's for sure.

22:08.327 --> 22:13.865
- 2,100 miles to the southeast...
- This one's going to

22:13.867 --> 22:15.500
Bloodvein, this load.

22:15.502 --> 22:19.571
Hugh Rowland is Polar
Industries' last man standing.

22:19.573 --> 22:20.205
You can't see.

22:20.207 --> 22:23.375
The snow dust kicks up, and your
visibility is 100% gone as soon

22:23.377 --> 22:26.578
as you go by, so it's
just a big guessing game.

22:26.580 --> 22:29.714
With the season in
chaos and Rick Yemm on the sick

22:29.716 --> 22:37.656
list, Hugh is buckling down
and going at it alone.

22:37.658 --> 22:40.692
First camp's, uh-- First kick at the
cat to go across Lake Winnipeg.

22:40.694 --> 22:42.761
I've never been
across there before.

22:42.763 --> 22:46.965
Plus I get another road under
my belt, so that's a good deal.

22:46.967 --> 22:50.035
But this trip has him
crossing Lake Winnipeg, one

22:50.037 --> 22:54.506
of the largest lakes
in the world.

23:01.981 --> 23:05.884
Let's get 'er done.

23:05.886 --> 23:12.591
She just opened, so she's gonna
be, uh... pretty new ice here.

23:19.065 --> 23:21.666
Get down onto the lake here.

23:21.668 --> 23:23.735
First time you come on there,
'cause the ice just crack,

23:23.737 --> 23:25.504
crack, crack, crack.

23:25.506 --> 23:27.606
You can hear it cracking.

23:34.847 --> 23:38.884
Getting on the
ice is just the beginning.

23:38.886 --> 23:40.619
Yeah, and there's a
big pressure Ridge.

23:40.621 --> 23:43.788
That's why it wasn't open up there
on, uh, on Lake Winnipeg there.

23:43.790 --> 23:45.357
It's about four feet wide.

23:45.359 --> 23:47.859
So this is where it gets kind
of hairy here is, uh, going

23:47.861 --> 23:50.695
across these pressure ridges.

23:50.697 --> 23:53.365
At the center of the
lake is a seam where two

23:53.367 --> 23:57.435
massive sheets of ice collide,
pushing against each other with

23:57.437 --> 24:01.173
enough force to open up
a four-foot-wide gap.

24:01.175 --> 24:05.010
Comin' up to this pressure
ridge here, she's definitely

24:05.012 --> 24:05.911
gotten higher and higher.

24:05.913 --> 24:07.245
You can see it all the
way across the lake.

24:07.247 --> 24:10.549
It goes right from one end
of the lake to the other.

24:10.551 --> 24:16.321
Pressure forms the ice, and it's
actually open water in there.

24:16.323 --> 24:19.424
So it-- We're basically going
from one floating chunk of ice

24:19.426 --> 24:20.625
over to the other.

24:20.627 --> 24:22.994
Crossing the
pressure ridge is a tightrope

24:22.996 --> 24:28.366
walk over a 118-foot drop to
the bottom of a frigid lake.

24:28.368 --> 24:30.936
We haven't got much room through
here, it's a-- Truck is

24:30.938 --> 24:34.691
just gonna fit here so...

24:40.547 --> 24:43.548
Oh, fuck!

24:43.550 --> 24:46.818
- Coming up...
- As a kid, I always wanted to be a hero.

24:46.820 --> 24:48.620
Alex is blindsided.

24:49.356 --> 24:50.155
Whoa!

24:53.288 --> 24:57.792
- In Manitoba, Canada...
- We're gonna go up and over

24:57.794 --> 24:59.994
this right now.

24:59.996 --> 25:04.632
Hugh Rowland's in
the middle of Lake Winnipeg.

25:09.939 --> 25:13.408
Oh, fuck!

25:13.410 --> 25:17.111
- He's gotta keep the
trailer straight... - Hang on.

25:17.113 --> 25:24.786
And move steadily from
one sheet of ice to the other.

25:24.788 --> 25:26.220
Wow.

25:26.222 --> 25:30.591
But we made it.

25:30.593 --> 25:33.661
He's passed the
pressure ridge, but he's not

25:33.663 --> 25:35.596
out of the water yet.

25:35.598 --> 25:38.766
So now we're on another piece
of floating ice over here, so

25:38.768 --> 25:41.836
we'll carry on across
the lake here.

25:58.955 --> 26:01.889
We're just coming off this
lake and, uh, still here.

26:01.891 --> 26:04.592
Still ain't been swimming.

26:04.594 --> 26:08.396
Off the ice,
Hugh reaches the village.

26:08.398 --> 26:12.900
Looks like Bloodvein is gonna
get their septic tanks today.

26:12.902 --> 26:15.269
And for the first
time in weeks, the Polar Bear

26:15.271 --> 26:17.071
racks up a delivery.

26:17.073 --> 26:21.509
Drop her off, we'll, uh, bobtail her
back to Winnipeg, so...

26:21.511 --> 26:23.144
Another quick cash grab here.

26:23.146 --> 26:27.181
Dash for the cash.

26:27.183 --> 26:27.882
Made it.

26:27.884 --> 26:30.985
Another trip in.

26:30.987 --> 26:37.158
1,800 miles to the northwest...

26:37.160 --> 26:41.329
Here we are, over the border.

26:41.331 --> 26:44.065
"Yukon, larger than life."

26:44.067 --> 26:46.734
Alex is running south
on the Dempster, taking

26:46.736 --> 26:50.138
advantage of a rare
break in the weather.

26:50.140 --> 26:52.540
When I was a kid, I always
wanted to be a hero.

26:52.542 --> 26:55.409
A few Superman comics I could
afford, I thought it would be

26:55.411 --> 27:00.414
great to be Superman and save all
these poor people from the bad guys.

27:00.416 --> 27:04.786
I've-- Through life, I've had the
opportunity a few times to be a hero.

27:04.788 --> 27:07.655
I've also had the opportunity a few
times to be a royal fucker, and

27:07.657 --> 27:08.957
I took that too.

27:21.570 --> 27:23.004
I got some--

27:23.006 --> 27:24.005
Whoa!

27:29.445 --> 27:36.617
A big chunk of snow came off the
bridge, and hit us in the roof.

27:36.619 --> 27:38.486
If that was, uh, frozen, it
could have come right through,

27:38.488 --> 27:39.720
and I could be wearing it.

27:39.722 --> 27:42.757
A big chunk of ice.

27:42.759 --> 27:45.760
Gonna keep an eye
on the road here.

27:45.762 --> 27:51.632
We still got a long way to go.

27:53.268 --> 28:01.742
- 370 miles to the west...
- Time to roll.

28:01.744 --> 28:04.245
Darrell's making good
time on his run to replace

28:04.247 --> 28:07.648
Jack Jessee as the
haul road ace.

28:07.650 --> 28:11.285
I don't know why Jack's
gone, but he is.

28:11.353 --> 28:12.954
That's more loads for me.

28:12.956 --> 28:14.288
More loads for the load count.

28:14.290 --> 28:16.824
And he will not be
able to catch up.

28:16.892 --> 28:20.928
I made me some time right here.

28:20.930 --> 28:22.763
They got the road blocked.

28:22.765 --> 28:26.033
I think somebody's crossed
up on the road up there.

28:26.035 --> 28:31.372
But nothing's
easy on the Dalton.

28:36.612 --> 28:38.946
Gonna have to hold up.

28:38.948 --> 28:43.150
Another delay of
Darrell's game.

28:45.787 --> 28:49.090
A bulker truck is
jack-knifed across the road,

28:49.092 --> 28:50.958
blocking all traffic.

28:56.265 --> 28:58.332
Oh, there's-- there's one
of my fellow truckers.

28:58.334 --> 29:00.334
I'm gonna walk up there and
see what he has to say.

29:04.706 --> 29:09.043
Looks like a hair ball
situation here, huh?

29:09.045 --> 29:11.045
Yeah, that wasn't pretty, boy.

29:11.047 --> 29:16.884
He's lucky he got it sideways, or
he would've ended up in the bushes.

29:16.886 --> 29:19.520
The driver of the
jack-knifed truck has already

29:19.522 --> 29:23.324
been taken back to town.

29:23.326 --> 29:24.692
Lucky dude, lucky dude.

29:24.694 --> 29:26.694
Yup. Lucky it turned
out the way it did.

29:26.696 --> 29:29.530
Looks like he's got the blade
here blocking off the road.

29:29.532 --> 29:29.563
Here blocking off the road.

29:29.598 --> 29:32.800
There goes Jarvis,
getting ready to go.

29:32.802 --> 29:32.867
To go.

29:32.901 --> 29:34.068
I wonder if Jarvis saw it.

29:34.070 --> 29:35.336
I bet he did.

29:38.073 --> 29:39.440
What's happening, Jarvis?

29:39.442 --> 29:40.975
Man, looks like a close call.

29:40.977 --> 29:42.343
It was a close call.

29:42.345 --> 29:43.878
It was indeed.

29:43.880 --> 29:45.980
Come up here a little bit.

29:45.982 --> 29:50.985
Jarvis Walton just
missed becoming part of the wreck.

29:50.987 --> 29:54.622
He just got too far out there on the
edge, out there on the shoulder.

29:54.624 --> 29:56.324
That's all snow.

29:56.326 --> 29:59.093
It was impossible for
him to correct it.

29:59.095 --> 30:01.996
Heading north, the
bulker lost control and

30:01.998 --> 30:04.966
Jack-knifed across the road.

30:04.968 --> 30:09.103
If Jarvis would have arrived a few
seconds earlier, he wouldn't

30:09.105 --> 30:10.604
be standing here now.

30:15.844 --> 30:18.612
Everything just unfolded,
happened so slow and so quickly.

30:18.614 --> 30:19.981
Just unbelievable, you know?

30:19.983 --> 30:23.184
Out here on the Dalton highway,
things can happen like that.

30:23.186 --> 30:28.089
You just gotta be
ready to react.

30:28.091 --> 30:29.724
That's a scary deal right there.

30:29.726 --> 30:30.691
That kills people.

30:32.562 --> 30:35.196
Until the wreck can be
cleared, Darrell will have to

30:35.198 --> 30:37.832
put his load count on hold.

30:37.834 --> 30:40.568
You can never hope enough that
you're not involved in one

30:40.570 --> 30:43.371
of those accidents, you know?

30:43.373 --> 30:47.074
Well, there's not much more I can
do sitting right there, so--

30:50.546 --> 30:55.616
25 miles to the west...

30:55.618 --> 30:58.552
Manley is the road
less traveled.

30:58.554 --> 31:02.623
Porkchop's in the
middle of a make-or-break trip.

31:02.625 --> 31:05.359
This ain't no joke,
that's for sure.

31:05.361 --> 31:06.927
You gotta be on the edge
of your seat up here.

31:06.929 --> 31:08.629
You can't just sit back
and enjoy your ride.

31:08.631 --> 31:10.564
You've got to be ready.

31:10.566 --> 31:13.300
He's fighting to prove
himself on his first solo

31:13.302 --> 31:18.406
run, and the 120-mile road to the
village of Manley is testing

31:18.408 --> 31:20.641
everything he's got.

31:20.643 --> 31:28.582
The Dalton is tough,
but this is Manley.

31:28.584 --> 31:30.718
It's a dangerous environment
all the way around.

31:30.720 --> 31:34.355
Every second you're on this road is a
second you might not make it back.

31:34.357 --> 31:40.394
I want to make it back
to my wife and kids.

31:40.396 --> 31:46.867
- Finally, near the end of the road...
- Coming up on a 13 and 6 bridge.

31:46.869 --> 31:50.471
I got about a half-inch
of clearance.

31:50.473 --> 31:53.407
A narrow bridge is
the last obstacle between

31:53.409 --> 31:59.313
Porkchop and the village.

31:59.315 --> 32:04.485
A mistake here will undo everything
he struggled to accomplish.

32:14.329 --> 32:15.396
Oh, boy.

32:31.079 --> 32:33.681
Oh, my God.

32:43.825 --> 32:45.437
Nothing to it.

32:48.733 --> 32:51.341
Porkchop pulls in to Manley.

32:52.476 --> 32:54.198
Hello!

32:54.233 --> 32:56.067
Is that thing full just for us?

32:56.168 --> 32:57.969
Yes, ma'am.

32:57.971 --> 33:03.674
And completes his first solo
delivery in the Alaskan wilderness.

33:03.676 --> 33:05.676
I want everybody to
remember one thing.

33:05.678 --> 33:07.411
You can't stop the Chop.

33:07.413 --> 33:08.346
Thank you, Porkchop.

33:08.348 --> 33:09.480
Yeah, thanks, Porkchop.

33:09.482 --> 33:11.482
You're welcome, Perry.

33:11.484 --> 33:18.389
Been the most productive day
yet since I've been up here.

33:18.391 --> 33:22.560
- Coming up... - Thought I'd
show back up and go back to work.

33:22.562 --> 33:24.629
The ace is back.

33:24.631 --> 33:25.997
Do you want my seat?

33:25.999 --> 33:28.532
I had to sit in yours
while you were gone.

33:36.501 --> 33:41.305
- 120 miles north of Fairbanks...
- Everything in my mind works

33:41.307 --> 33:42.339
like clockwork.

33:42.341 --> 33:44.575
Everything out here on this
road works like disaster.

33:46.279 --> 33:48.445
Darrell's plan to take
the lead in the load count

33:48.447 --> 33:55.019
is on hold while crews clear a
jack-knifed truck from the road.

33:58.491 --> 33:59.857
Delays, delays, delays.

33:59.859 --> 34:01.225
I'm only gonna make it
to Coldfoot tonight.

34:01.227 --> 34:02.593
- I'm gonna turn this in--
- Hello?

34:02.595 --> 34:04.228
We all clear back there?

34:04.230 --> 34:07.831
I'm gonna turn this
into a three-day trip.

34:13.739 --> 34:16.907
Looks like we're moving.

34:21.379 --> 34:27.217
Coming up on that
accident makes you think.

34:32.592 --> 34:36.159
You know, this could happen
to anybody out here.

34:36.161 --> 34:37.594
Makes you think
about your kids.

34:37.597 --> 34:40.364
Makes me think
about Reno a lot.

34:40.366 --> 34:43.167
For Darrell, leading
the load count is his

34:43.168 --> 34:46.870
shot at providing a
better life for his son.

34:46.871 --> 34:50.341
You know, you're missing your
children and your spouse, or

34:50.342 --> 34:52.710
whatever, and-- You know?

34:52.712 --> 34:56.780
Then one day you go home and
it ain't even there anymore.

34:56.782 --> 35:01.986
But being the
best comes at a price.

35:01.988 --> 35:04.455
That's part of the life of a
trucker, and I don't want to see

35:04.457 --> 35:11.261
Reno end up in that
same boat, you know?

35:11.263 --> 35:14.832
I want him to have something
better than what I had.

35:14.834 --> 35:18.569
Everybody wants that
for their children.

35:18.571 --> 35:22.640
I want Reno to go off to school
and get a good education, and I

35:22.642 --> 35:25.209
don't want to see him
struggle at all.

35:25.211 --> 35:32.616
I'll struggle to make
sure he doesn't have to.

35:32.618 --> 35:35.719
Give him the life
that I wanted.

35:35.721 --> 35:41.025
Keep on truckin'.

35:45.730 --> 35:50.934
- 30 miles to the south...
- It's been a long day so far.

35:50.936 --> 35:54.738
I don't think we're gonna make it to
Coldfoot like we originally planned.

35:54.740 --> 35:57.141
Austin's out to prove
he belongs on the Dalton

35:57.143 --> 35:58.942
heavy-haul team by pushing a

35:58.944 --> 36:01.845
100-ton building up the road.

36:01.847 --> 36:05.949
All the delays this morning and
today have definitely, uh--

36:05.951 --> 36:07.851
We've lost time over them.

36:07.853 --> 36:11.221
But a day of delays
has the trip behind schedule.

36:11.223 --> 36:14.491
I really wanted to minimize my
time having to drive in the

36:14.493 --> 36:17.594
dark with this load, but sometimes
you gotta do what you gotta do.

36:17.596 --> 36:19.029
Keep moving.

36:19.031 --> 36:21.832
They're driving into
the night to make up time.

36:21.933 --> 36:23.067
Looking good now.

36:23.069 --> 36:25.969
Okay, Austin, I'm on here.

36:25.971 --> 36:28.072
All right, I'm coming.

36:28.139 --> 36:34.978
And things are
finally looking up.

36:48.828 --> 36:50.661
What is that sound?

36:53.466 --> 36:55.733
Damn it.

36:55.834 --> 36:58.402
The engine is not running
smoothly, like it should.

36:58.404 --> 37:02.172
Straining under the
100-ton load, Carey's truck is

37:02.174 --> 37:04.842
starting to quit.

37:04.844 --> 37:10.481
Man, I cannot believe this
is happening right now.

37:10.483 --> 37:11.749
My truck's cutting out.

37:11.751 --> 37:16.019
I'm gonna go up to the 100-mile pullout
up here and stop and check it out.

37:16.021 --> 37:18.122
Okay.

37:18.124 --> 37:22.493
I've already lost a lot of hours on
this haul due to broke-down trucks.

37:22.495 --> 37:26.663
Without all three trucks, the
heavy-haul mission is in jeopardy.

37:26.665 --> 37:29.666
It's almost like this trip
wasn't meant to be, you know?

37:29.668 --> 37:31.201
One thing after another.

37:31.203 --> 37:36.406
Might have to drop this load
up here and go back to town.

37:36.408 --> 37:42.212
Two steps forward and
three steps backwards.

37:42.313 --> 37:45.048
With the convoy
stopped, Austin's Dalton

37:45.050 --> 37:48.852
heavy-haul debut is
looking like a bust.

37:48.854 --> 37:51.421
Eh, knocking like it might
be an injector going out.

37:51.423 --> 37:54.925
That means it's gotta go to the shop
if it's got an injector going out.

37:54.927 --> 37:58.228
I got some bad news, and
I got some bad news.

37:58.230 --> 38:00.330
What's wrong?

38:00.332 --> 38:02.065
Got something missing
there real bad.

38:02.067 --> 38:07.037
Think it might be an injector
going out or something.

38:07.039 --> 38:08.105
All right, drop it.

38:08.107 --> 38:09.706
I'm hooking up to it.

38:09.708 --> 38:12.242
Let's go, Greg.

38:12.244 --> 38:14.511
That ain't gonna work either.

38:14.513 --> 38:17.181
Despite the rookie's
eagerness, there's no

38:17.183 --> 38:21.618
way the veteran's handing over
the load to the first-timer.

38:21.620 --> 38:24.955
It means the haul is shut down.

38:24.957 --> 38:27.191
I thought that the breakdown
train was over, but it's not

38:27.193 --> 38:32.896
over yet, so... I gotta drop the
load and go back to town, the shop.

38:32.898 --> 38:36.433
Hopefully it's a quick
fix in the morning.

38:36.435 --> 38:38.836
Their deadline
is now just two days

38:38.838 --> 38:44.241
away, and they've only
made it 100 miles.

38:44.243 --> 38:47.344
Well, we're sitting
here at 100 mile.

38:47.346 --> 38:49.446
Carey's truck broke down.

38:49.448 --> 38:52.716
Sucks this happened.

38:52.718 --> 38:55.419
It's been a really long day.

38:55.421 --> 39:00.090
I feel like they should
let me pull this load.

39:00.092 --> 39:02.893
I know I can do it.

39:02.895 --> 39:05.762
Yeah, I don't have a lot of
experience in it, but I still

39:05.764 --> 39:08.498
know I can do it.

39:08.500 --> 39:12.035
It's just my age and
inexperience, but you gotta

39:12.037 --> 39:14.872
give people a chance to do that
kind of stuff to prove to the

39:14.874 --> 39:17.808
bosses that you can do it.

39:17.810 --> 39:20.611
Instead of proving
himself as a heavy-hauler,

39:20.613 --> 39:25.816
Austin's big chance is going
down as a heavy-haul failure.

39:25.818 --> 39:28.151
It's just been a really bad day.

39:28.153 --> 39:34.191
I'm just ready to go to
bed, forget about it.

39:45.370 --> 39:51.475
450 miles to the east...

39:51.477 --> 39:55.479
Yeah, I'm coming into Dawson,
just like a wild sled dog here.

39:55.481 --> 39:58.181
Alex is at the end
of his run after spending the

39:58.183 --> 40:01.551
day driving the entire
Dempster highway.

40:01.553 --> 40:04.421
Fairly long day.

40:04.423 --> 40:08.792
Basically have the whole
Dempster in one day, today.

40:08.794 --> 40:10.894
I'm at the end of my trip.

40:10.896 --> 40:14.998
Put on a good 500 miles today.

40:15.000 --> 40:18.568
With Jack gone, Austin
and Darrell sit tied for

40:18.570 --> 40:27.344
the lead, and Porkchop's
only two loads behind.

40:27.346 --> 40:32.883
But back in Fairbanks, Alaska,
the game's about to change.

40:32.885 --> 40:35.786
Yeah, you know, a couple of
days ago I-I left here in a

40:35.788 --> 40:37.721
really bad mood, you know?

40:37.723 --> 40:40.424
Showed up to get a load, and
they didn't have a load for me.

40:40.426 --> 40:45.362
It just set with me wrong, so
hopefully, I still got a job.

40:45.364 --> 40:51.368
And all I really want is to
just get on the haul road.

40:51.370 --> 40:53.270
Oh, got a moment?

40:53.272 --> 40:56.073
What's going on?

40:56.075 --> 40:59.943
Not much, just... thought I'd
show back up and go back to

40:59.945 --> 41:02.012
work, and get another load.

41:02.014 --> 41:04.247
Do you want my seat?

41:04.249 --> 41:06.283
I had to sit in yours
while you were gone.

41:06.285 --> 41:10.487
- When Jack walked out...
- Jack's not here, so I'm gonna

41:10.489 --> 41:11.989
take the load today.

41:11.991 --> 41:15.859
Lane was forced
to fill in for the ace.

41:17.596 --> 41:20.998
We're gonna make
good work of this.

41:21.000 --> 41:23.233
Sometimes it's good for you and
Harry to get back up there.

41:23.235 --> 41:24.768
See what we have to
deal with again.

41:24.770 --> 41:25.702
Refresh your memories.

41:25.704 --> 41:30.007
Uh, probably be in your best
interest if, you know, we made

41:30.009 --> 41:35.445
that decision when we were
gonna go up there, not you.

41:35.447 --> 41:40.617
You know, I mean-- You left-- You left
me with a pretty tough spot, Jack.

41:40.619 --> 41:44.254
Well, you know, I mean, I've been a
company man for quite a few years now.

41:44.256 --> 41:48.258
You know, it's just-- All these
new guys, and all the issues

41:48.260 --> 41:51.461
we've got going up on the road up
there this year, just-- I don't know.

41:51.463 --> 41:54.064
Maybe it all piled up
and fell all at once.

41:54.066 --> 41:57.300
Well, you've been here a long
time, but, uh, this is not one

41:57.302 --> 42:02.172
- of your brighter moments, so--
- The way it all went down--

42:02.174 --> 42:05.308
- kind of how it went down, so--
- I'd like to think that, you

42:05.310 --> 42:10.881
know, you have enough respect for
me that it wouldn't happen again.

42:17.155 --> 42:19.890
We're up against the wire, and,
uh, we've still got more than

42:19.892 --> 42:25.862
half the loads left, so we
got our work cut out for us.

42:25.864 --> 42:27.497
Ready to go back to work then?

42:27.499 --> 42:28.532
I am.

42:28.534 --> 42:29.566
Up again.

42:29.568 --> 42:30.233
Thanks.

42:30.235 --> 42:31.535
Glad you have you back, Jack.

42:31.537 --> 42:33.070
I want him to feel the
pain a little bit.

42:33.072 --> 42:36.306
He stormed out, and, uh-- You
know, now he's gonna-- Hopefully

42:36.308 --> 42:41.978
he regrets that and thinks about
it before he does it next time.

42:41.980 --> 42:45.082
It's about time things started
working right around here.

42:45.084 --> 42:46.249
Finally got a decent load.

42:46.251 --> 42:51.788
We're gonna get this job done.

42:52.990 --> 42:59.463
Loaded up, I'm ready to
roll, and go to Prudhoe.

43:06.437 --> 43:11.608
Those other rookies better
watch out... 'cause I'm back.

43:11.610 --> 43:13.977
Next time,
on Ice Road Truckers.

43:13.979 --> 43:15.645
Fire!

43:15.647 --> 43:18.381
As the season
hits the halfway point...

43:18.383 --> 43:20.817
Get the hell out of the
way, here comes the Chop.

43:21.720 --> 43:23.253
Whoa, crap!

43:23.255 --> 43:27.724
The competition heats up
as the ace returns to the haul road.

43:27.726 --> 43:30.927
Holy fuck!

43:30.929 --> 43:32.829
This is really dangerous.

43:36.468 --> 43:38.835
the fucking ice before.
