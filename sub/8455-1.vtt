WEBVTT

01:33.041 --> 01:36.083
I have relived
this particular day many times.

01:37.333 --> 01:41.708
The weather is always flawless,
and so is Father's mood.

01:41.750 --> 01:46.416
It is a golden memory
and I am suspicious of it.

01:55.083 --> 01:58.000
I keep looking
for one black cloud in the sky,

01:58.041 --> 02:01.750
for some premonition
of what was to come,

02:01.791 --> 02:06.333
but I can't find anything.
Not a single clue.

02:26.166 --> 02:30.333
Father had been let out
and Mother was laughing.

02:30.375 --> 02:32.666
Perhaps, it really was
a happy day.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.125
Would you like to live there?

02:50.166 --> 02:52.000
Can we?

03:19.541 --> 03:20.916
Dear, God.

03:22.833 --> 03:24.666
Dear, God!

03:26.583 --> 03:28.083
Mommy, Mommy, look at us!

03:28.125 --> 03:30.625
Look at us!

03:30.666 --> 03:32.416
Isn't it wonderful!

03:32.458 --> 03:36.250
I shall have this place
if it costs me my last shilling!

03:38.583 --> 03:42.500
I will write masterpieces here.

03:42.541 --> 03:44.333
And we believed him.

04:13.208 --> 04:16.875
I write this
sitting in the kitchen sink.

04:16.916 --> 04:20.500
I have a grandstand view
of my relations,

04:20.541 --> 04:22.875
and it depresses me.

04:22.916 --> 04:26.625
Ten years on, nothing Father
said would happen has,

04:26.666 --> 04:28.666
and there have been
other shocks.

04:28.708 --> 04:30.291
My hands have gone green.

04:30.333 --> 04:31.875
Doesn't it
make you feel God-like,

04:31.916 --> 04:34.083
turning things
a different color?

04:34.125 --> 04:36.083
We have acquired a stepmother,
for a start...

04:36.125 --> 04:37.416
Brackets, not wicked.

04:37.458 --> 04:39.625
Nothing will get it off.
Nothing!

04:39.666 --> 04:41.916
Have you tried
all the perfumes of Arabia?

04:41.958 --> 04:44.041
We can't get any more credit
at the stores.

04:44.083 --> 04:45.500
Is it any wonder?

04:45.541 --> 04:47.583
I've been drawing up
our accounts.

04:47.625 --> 04:50.541
Income, nil.

04:50.583 --> 04:53.041
Outgoings...
How much is the rent?

04:53.083 --> 04:54.791
He hasn't paid it
for two years.

04:54.833 --> 04:56.583
We'll end up
living in a ditch.

04:56.625 --> 05:00.750
At least the landlord's
shuffled off this mortal coil.

05:00.791 --> 05:03.333
It's not unmitigated gloom.

05:09.375 --> 05:14.333
Um... no,
I was looking for my cardigan.

05:14.375 --> 05:17.375
Oh, my love, I've got
this sudden mania for dyeing.

05:17.416 --> 05:19.125
It is going to look
rather wonderful,

05:19.166 --> 05:21.708
a cross between
sun-fire and lichen.

05:36.041 --> 05:38.250
Don't let me interrupt the game.

05:44.375 --> 05:46.125
Game?

05:46.166 --> 05:47.708
Game!

05:51.333 --> 05:54.291
There are droppings
in this cupboard!

05:55.875 --> 05:57.625
I hate this place!

05:57.666 --> 06:00.291
I'd burn it down
if we had any matches.

06:03.291 --> 06:07.583
-On the streets.

06:07.625 --> 06:10.916
You can't go on the streets
in the depths of Suffolk.

06:10.958 --> 06:12.291
I could in London.

06:12.333 --> 06:14.041
You haven't got the train fare.

06:14.083 --> 06:17.416
I'm going to the vicarage
to borrow from the poor box.

06:17.458 --> 06:19.250
Prostitution is very hard work,
Rose.

06:19.291 --> 06:21.875
-It wouldn't suit you at all.
-You should know.

06:21.916 --> 06:24.208
There's a picture of you
in the Tate with nothing on.

06:24.250 --> 06:27.083
It was an experiment
in flesh tones.

06:27.125 --> 06:28.750
If you really want
to make a fortune,

06:28.791 --> 06:31.000
choose a wealthy man
and marry him respectably.

06:31.041 --> 06:32.875
Like you did with Father?

06:34.250 --> 06:37.291
-Oh.
-Sorry, sorry.

06:37.333 --> 06:40.250
-You don't mean it, Rose.
-Get off, Topaz.

06:40.291 --> 06:41.791
You're not our mother!

06:41.833 --> 06:44.541
-I do my best!
-Well, it's not good enough!

06:44.583 --> 06:47.250
I thought
about going to comfort them,

06:47.291 --> 06:51.750
but it would only have
inflamed the situation.

06:51.791 --> 06:54.125
Someone has
to keep a lid on things.

06:54.166 --> 06:58.125
Mother always did
when she was alive.

06:58.166 --> 07:01.541
Rose... I don't think
you should start

07:01.583 --> 07:04.333
threatening
to go on the streets.

07:04.375 --> 07:07.625
You'll never be able
to marry anyone after that,

07:07.666 --> 07:09.166
least of all a wealthy man.

07:09.208 --> 07:12.125
I'll never meet any men
locked up here,

07:12.166 --> 07:16.166
beyond the reach of love,
and it will kill me.

07:16.208 --> 07:18.916
I would have thought that love
was the murderous thing,

07:18.958 --> 07:20.541
not the lack of it.

07:20.583 --> 07:22.625
I am never
going to fall in love.

07:22.666 --> 07:24.916
Life is dangerous enough.

07:24.958 --> 07:26.958
Oh, thank God
for that at least.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.625
-The postman's
coming up the drive.

07:32.666 --> 07:35.625
As manager for
the Scotney estate,

07:35.666 --> 07:40.208
this office begs to inform you,
etcetera, etcetera...

07:40.250 --> 07:45.291
We respectfully request
that the rent outstanding

07:45.333 --> 07:48.791
for the period,
June 1934 to March 1936,

07:48.833 --> 07:52.125
be forwarded to this office
without delay.

07:54.041 --> 07:55.666
Wow.

07:55.708 --> 07:57.958
Open the other one.
It's from the publisher.

07:59.625 --> 08:02.166
The royalty check
always comes in the spring.

08:07.625 --> 08:08.791
Oh.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.666
Nothing this year.

08:16.708 --> 08:18.166
Nothing?

08:18.208 --> 08:20.458
Are there any biscuits left?

08:20.500 --> 08:23.791
There's never been
nothing before.

08:23.833 --> 08:25.875
First time for everything.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.833
I brought a bucket.

08:52.875 --> 08:54.708
For the leak in the roof.

08:54.750 --> 08:56.250
Ah.

08:58.250 --> 09:01.541
-No.

09:01.583 --> 09:03.833
I was reading
"Death on the Nile."

09:03.875 --> 09:06.291
Is there anything
I can do to help?

09:06.333 --> 09:08.833
What makes you think
I'm in need of assistance?

09:10.333 --> 09:12.875
Father, "Jacob Wrestling"

09:12.916 --> 09:15.416
was a wonderful,
groundbreaking book.

09:15.458 --> 09:18.416
There was never going
to be a sequel overnight.

09:18.458 --> 09:19.625
Meaning?

09:19.666 --> 09:22.833
Meaning it will come.

09:22.875 --> 09:27.708
-Seventeen.

09:29.458 --> 09:32.500
And you still believe
in fairy tales?

09:41.750 --> 09:44.583
I will not give in to panic.

09:44.625 --> 09:48.083
I'd be as mad
as the rest of them
if it wasn't for this diary.

09:49.375 --> 09:51.291
Stephen is like a rock.

09:51.333 --> 09:53.708
We haven't paid him
for six months.

09:53.750 --> 09:55.500
He could just
pack his bags and go,

09:55.541 --> 09:58.583
but he says
he'll never leave us.

10:02.916 --> 10:04.583
Margarine.

10:04.625 --> 10:07.500
Why must you be
so monotonously grim, Rose?

10:07.541 --> 10:09.250
I feel grim.

10:09.291 --> 10:11.791
Right now, I'd sell my soul
to the devil

10:11.833 --> 10:14.708
for a roast beef dinner
and a Tangee lipstick.

10:14.750 --> 10:17.166
Why don't you
wish on the gargoyle?

10:17.208 --> 10:19.625
You could pretend
that was the devil.

10:25.666 --> 10:28.916
Stephen, fetch a ladder
that will reach.

10:29.958 --> 10:31.833
We haven't got one,
Miss Rose.

10:31.875 --> 10:33.500
He's not a servant.

10:37.125 --> 10:39.833
Blow the candles out,
all except one.

10:47.083 --> 10:48.666
Come on.

10:49.958 --> 10:51.500
Higher.

10:51.541 --> 10:54.583
Perhaps we could buy
a pig on higher purchase.

10:54.625 --> 10:57.083
We would have quite a lot
of bacon, eventually.

10:58.208 --> 10:59.583
It's all right.

10:59.625 --> 11:00.833
Rose is dabbling in the occult.

11:00.875 --> 11:02.125
Higher.

11:04.666 --> 11:07.625
Full marks for enterprise.

11:07.666 --> 11:10.000
Be careful, Rose.

11:12.166 --> 11:13.708
Careful!

11:18.333 --> 11:20.875
I can't go on living like this.

11:22.541 --> 11:24.916
Please...

11:24.958 --> 11:27.166
I'll do anything.

12:08.458 --> 12:11.250
It's whole nut.

12:11.291 --> 12:14.250
Oh, Stephen,
you shouldn't have.

12:14.291 --> 12:15.916
Don't you like whole nut?

12:15.958 --> 12:18.458
I mean you shouldn't
have spent your money on me.

12:18.500 --> 12:20.625
There isn't any food
in the house.

12:20.666 --> 12:22.958
Now, have you got
everything you need?

12:23.000 --> 12:26.166
A roaring fire,
concealing draperies...

12:26.208 --> 12:28.666
What more could a lady
want at bath time?

12:28.708 --> 12:30.916
A wireless would be nice.

12:30.958 --> 12:32.833
Chocolate is luxury enough.

12:34.333 --> 12:36.500
I could get you some
without nuts next time.

12:36.541 --> 12:38.125
Stephen...

13:00.666 --> 13:04.166
Topaz has said that,
viewed from a certain angle,

13:04.208 --> 13:07.916
Stephen looks like all of
the Greek gods rolled into one.

13:07.958 --> 13:11.625
I can't see it,
and it's probably just as well.

13:11.666 --> 13:14.166
I've known him
since I was seven.

13:14.208 --> 13:15.958
He's like a brother to me.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.958
Anything else
would be much too confusing.

13:20.666 --> 13:21.916
Come in.

13:23.375 --> 13:24.916
Hello?

13:24.958 --> 13:26.291
Hello

13:26.333 --> 13:27.375
Somebody said, "Come in."

13:27.416 --> 13:29.000
Can you believe this place?

13:29.041 --> 13:30.458
It looks like something
out of a storybook.

13:30.500 --> 13:31.708
Yeah, the "House of Usher."

13:31.750 --> 13:33.375
Hello?

13:33.416 --> 13:34.791
I'm sorry,
we have a car stuck in the lane.

13:34.833 --> 13:36.833
Do you have a horse
or something?

13:36.875 --> 13:38.583
Actually, no.
Leave this to me.

13:38.625 --> 13:40.916
We need a motor tractor
and some heavy-gauge chains.

13:40.958 --> 13:42.375
Come on,
I'll show you the problem.

13:42.416 --> 13:44.291
You stay here,
soak up the atmosphere.

13:55.958 --> 13:59.750
I should warn you,
I'm having a bath behind here.

14:01.625 --> 14:05.166
I'm sorry.
Is your mother at home?

14:05.208 --> 14:06.625
No.

14:09.083 --> 14:12.625
-Oh, thank you.

14:12.666 --> 14:15.083
-I'm Simon Cotton, by the way.

14:15.125 --> 14:17.041
We were on our way
to Scotney Hall.

14:17.083 --> 14:21.333
Are you related to Sir William?
He lived there until he died.

14:21.375 --> 14:24.625
Whoo. The kid's gone to a farm
to fetch help.

14:24.666 --> 14:28.125
Oh, hi. Is there a madhouse
around here?

14:28.166 --> 14:31.000
We thought we saw an escapee
up by the lane.

14:31.041 --> 14:34.291
This is my brother, Neil.
We did see a strange woman
in the field.

14:34.333 --> 14:37.458
-She looked a bit disheveled.
-She was stark
staring naked, Simon.

14:37.500 --> 14:41.166
Oh, well, I can't imagine
who that was.

14:46.708 --> 14:49.833
-Oh, I thought you were a child.
-No.

14:49.875 --> 14:52.208
Are you here on holiday?

14:52.250 --> 14:54.458
I'm actually
Sir William's grandson.

14:54.500 --> 14:56.708
Our father died
a little while ago in Montana

14:56.750 --> 15:00.500
and I seem to be
in charge of the estate now.

15:00.541 --> 15:04.666
Rose

15:18.791 --> 15:20.500
Whoa... whoa. Careful!

15:24.041 --> 15:27.500
Cassandra, put the kettle on
for cocoa.

15:28.958 --> 15:30.291
I must change.

15:32.541 --> 15:35.208
More gas, Simon, more gas!

15:36.666 --> 15:38.666
Keep pushing the back!

15:38.708 --> 15:42.958
I saw lights
from the gatehouse.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.041
Hey, guys,
we got reinforcements!

15:45.083 --> 15:47.541
-It's our father.
-James Mortmain.

15:47.583 --> 15:50.666
Yeah, Neil Cotton. Would you
mind just going to the back?

15:50.708 --> 15:53.125
-Of course.

15:53.166 --> 15:56.416
Are you James Mortmain,
the author of "Jacob Wrestling?"

15:56.458 --> 15:58.708
Well, yes, I am.

15:58.750 --> 16:01.083
I wrote a dissertation
on that in college.

16:01.125 --> 16:03.666
"Polyphony in the Fragmentary
Consciousness."

16:03.708 --> 16:06.000
I wondered what became of you.

16:07.041 --> 16:08.708
Now you know.

16:08.750 --> 16:10.625
Well, I guess owning
a place like the castle

16:10.666 --> 16:12.500
must be an amazing source
of inspiration.

16:12.541 --> 16:15.250
We don't own it. You do.

16:15.291 --> 16:17.916
Do I

16:17.958 --> 16:20.416
Do you hear that, Neil?
I own the castle!

16:20.458 --> 16:22.250
That's wonderful, Simon.

16:22.291 --> 16:24.500
Could you go to the back
and help with the pushing, sir?

16:24.541 --> 16:26.625
-Yes.
-We must talk
more about your work.

16:26.666 --> 16:30.208
-Well, it would be my pleasure.

16:30.250 --> 16:35.791
For crying out loud,
will these bloody cataracts
and hurricanes never stop?

16:37.208 --> 16:39.416
Are you ready, Neil?

16:39.458 --> 16:42.583
They didn't say anything
about the rent.

16:42.625 --> 16:45.416
Those boys are
very taken with you, Rose.

16:45.458 --> 16:47.375
How can you tell?

16:47.416 --> 16:50.541
I've always had antennae
for the currents of attraction.

16:50.583 --> 16:54.541
I shall have to clean
the drawing room
in case they call again.

16:54.583 --> 16:58.833
Rose Cotton.
Mrs. Rose Cotton.

16:58.875 --> 17:00.416
Mrs. Cotton.

17:00.458 --> 17:03.541
-Simon. He's the eldest.

17:03.583 --> 17:05.833
It's his estate now
and his fortune.

17:05.875 --> 17:07.875
Was Sir William
a knight or baronet?

17:07.916 --> 17:11.291
If he was a baronet,
then Simon's, Sir Simon.

17:11.333 --> 17:13.541
I'd be Lady Cotton then.

17:13.583 --> 17:16.083
Rose, you're making
too much of it.

17:16.125 --> 17:18.541
I mean they might ask us
to parties and things

17:18.583 --> 17:21.916
and that would be wonderful,
but you couldn't marry that man
with the beard.

17:21.958 --> 17:25.041
I'd marry a chimpanzee
if he had money.

17:32.583 --> 17:35.916
Simon, you cannot
stay in this country.

17:35.958 --> 17:38.208
You'll either get
washed away by the rain

17:38.250 --> 17:42.500
or sucked down into the mud
and never seen again.

17:42.541 --> 17:45.666
I don't want to buy
a ranch in California.

17:45.708 --> 17:49.625
Oranges are wonderful things.
I'm sure growing them
is a very stimulating pursuit,

17:49.666 --> 17:51.375
but I'd go mad.

17:51.416 --> 17:54.458
And you'll stay sane
in that pokey old mansion.

17:54.500 --> 17:57.625
Getting it cleaned and building
bathrooms for Mother.

17:57.666 --> 18:00.000
How many mirrors does a dame
with one face need?

18:00.041 --> 18:03.375
She's never stayed
anywhere in Europe
that wasn't a hotel before.

18:03.416 --> 18:05.500
If I don't get
the plumbing fixed
by the time she comes,

18:05.541 --> 18:07.000
she'll take one look
at the place,

18:07.041 --> 18:10.125
head straight back
to the Queen Mary.

18:10.166 --> 18:12.541
I guess I don't know her
quite as well as you do.

18:17.875 --> 18:19.125
Rose?

18:19.166 --> 18:20.458
Rose?

18:20.500 --> 18:23.291
Don't stop washing your hair!

18:30.291 --> 18:31.791
Simon.

18:31.833 --> 18:34.541
-Thank you.
-Neil.

18:36.041 --> 18:37.708
Darling.

18:43.250 --> 18:45.625
So, who's the artist
in the family?

18:47.375 --> 18:49.208
Her.

18:49.250 --> 18:52.833
It's called "War and Peace."

18:52.875 --> 18:54.833
Based on the novel.

18:54.875 --> 18:58.791
I think it might work better
on a circular canvas.

19:15.791 --> 19:18.250
Why are you all
dressed in green?

19:28.583 --> 19:31.041
Simon,
you may turn the pages for me.

19:31.083 --> 19:34.083
-I'm afraid I don't read music.
-I don't either.

19:34.125 --> 19:36.541
That need not detain us.
Come on.

19:47.583 --> 19:48.875
Thank you.

19:51.958 --> 19:54.750
I'll give you
a nudge each time.

19:56.291 --> 19:59.958
♪ Blow, blow

20:00.000 --> 20:04.500
♪ Thou winter wind

20:04.541 --> 20:10.541
♪ Thou art not so unkind

20:10.583 --> 20:14.666

20:14.708 --> 20:16.000
Christ.

20:16.041 --> 20:17.375
You were lucky
to get out alive.

20:17.416 --> 20:18.708
She wasn't
like that last night.

20:18.750 --> 20:20.416
Did I do something
to encourage her?

20:20.458 --> 20:23.625
You own Scotney Hall,
7000 acres, and their house,

20:23.666 --> 20:25.083
and they obviously
don't have a cent.

20:25.125 --> 20:26.666
She can't help that.

20:26.708 --> 20:28.416
Well, she can't help
being so darn obvious,

20:28.458 --> 20:30.666
but if you want a pack of insane
broads chasing after you

20:30.708 --> 20:32.750
in theatrical costumes,
that's your choice.

20:32.791 --> 20:34.458
One insane broad.

20:34.500 --> 20:37.916
My God, I was embarrassed
for that girl.

20:37.958 --> 20:40.000
We're going to have
to drop them, Simon.

20:40.041 --> 20:43.583
If we don't, you could end up
in a very awkward situation.

20:43.625 --> 20:45.000
He's dangerous.

20:46.541 --> 20:48.250
I guess so.

20:48.291 --> 20:49.916
It's a pity we didn't see
that kid again, though.

20:49.958 --> 20:51.500
The one with the glasses
or the one in the bathtub?

20:51.541 --> 20:54.125
The bathtub.
She was quite funny.

20:54.166 --> 20:56.958
A bit consciously naive,
don't you think?

20:57.000 --> 20:59.416
I feel worse
about dropping the old man.

20:59.458 --> 21:04.583
I wanted to help him,
but I guess he probably is
a drunk, like people say.

21:06.666 --> 21:08.958
If only we could afford
to send her to the cinema,

21:09.000 --> 21:12.000
she'd have a much better idea
of how to behave.

21:12.041 --> 21:13.625
It's too late.

21:13.666 --> 21:15.833
I've got this brick wall
sort of feeling.

21:15.875 --> 21:17.875
They won't come back.

21:20.458 --> 21:23.166
Please don't.
It's broad daylight.

21:23.208 --> 21:26.958
It brings me release.
Do you want me to run mad?

21:37.875 --> 21:39.458
What did you think of them?

21:39.500 --> 21:41.000
The Americans?

21:41.041 --> 21:42.833
I don't know.

21:42.875 --> 21:45.750
They weren't like anyone
I've ever met before.

21:45.791 --> 21:48.916
-Did you think
they were handsome?
-No.

21:48.958 --> 21:51.250
I mean, they were incredibly
well-turned-out,

21:51.291 --> 21:54.375
but not naturally
good-looking, like some people.

22:00.416 --> 22:02.916
-I wished you'd stop
calling me "Miss."

22:02.958 --> 22:04.958
It's just not the way
things are anymore.

22:05.000 --> 22:06.875
The first day we ever came here,

22:06.916 --> 22:09.875
my mother said that you
and Miss Rose were young ladies

22:09.916 --> 22:11.416
and that I ought
to address you respectfully.

22:11.458 --> 22:13.583
You always did.

22:13.625 --> 22:17.083
She said
that I was never to presume.

22:19.125 --> 22:20.541
Would I...

22:23.125 --> 22:26.291
Would I be presuming if I asked
you to come for a walk with me?

22:28.291 --> 22:29.625
When?

22:31.875 --> 22:34.208
When the bluebells are out.

22:36.041 --> 22:39.000
No, you wouldn't.

22:43.958 --> 22:47.708
♪ The very thought of you

22:49.625 --> 22:53.041

22:55.500 --> 22:57.208

It uses the keys

23:04.250 --> 23:08.458

I ought to tell her the truth,
but I can't bear to.

23:13.291 --> 23:15.000
She's the only woman
in the house

23:15.041 --> 23:16.750
with a smile on her face.

23:16.791 --> 23:20.916

Pass the salt,
pass the salt, pass the salt.

23:42.041 --> 23:44.583
-Rose!

23:44.625 --> 23:46.958
You know he's got
a perforated eardrum!

23:47.000 --> 23:48.708
And I suppose he'll go deaf now,
or die,

23:48.750 --> 23:49.708
and I'll be held responsible!

23:49.750 --> 23:51.250
Stop it, stop it!

23:51.291 --> 23:53.541
When will you learn
to control yourselves?

23:53.583 --> 23:55.375
I haven't lost my temper
for years!

23:55.416 --> 23:57.666
Just as well, when you think
what happened last time.

23:57.708 --> 24:00.333
That's enough, Rose.

24:02.833 --> 24:06.333
You don't think they found out
about Father, do you?

24:06.375 --> 24:08.583
No, I'm sure they didn't.

24:09.875 --> 24:11.208
How could they?

24:11.250 --> 24:13.750
So why didn't they come back?

24:13.791 --> 24:17.000
I went out of my way to be
flirtatious and provocative.

24:17.041 --> 24:19.625
That's what men
are meant to like.

24:21.000 --> 24:23.916
There's no way out now,
is there, Cassie?

24:46.916 --> 24:49.083
chatter]

24:52.291 --> 24:54.250
-Calm down.
-I'm quite calm.

24:54.291 --> 24:58.083
I'm quite calm, thank you.
Just shut up! Just shut up!

24:58.125 --> 25:00.750
-Sit down
and stop all this noise!
-No, I won't sit down.

25:00.791 --> 25:02.166
Stop it!

25:02.208 --> 25:03.375
Stop it!

25:04.666 --> 25:06.541
Stop it!

25:06.583 --> 25:10.333
And I posit to you, my
lord, that to kill one's wife

25:10.375 --> 25:15.375
with a cake knife would be an
extraordinarily tedious business

25:15.416 --> 25:17.791
involving sawing her to death.

25:24.791 --> 25:26.666
Take him down.

25:42.833 --> 25:45.708
We've been living
in a boarding house.

25:45.750 --> 25:48.041
Only for four months.

25:55.500 --> 25:57.541
It won't happen again.

25:59.750 --> 26:01.250
Girls?

26:01.291 --> 26:05.500
Girls? Girls!

26:05.541 --> 26:08.958
Aunt Millicent is dead
and she has left you

26:09.000 --> 26:11.875
a portion of her wardrobe.

26:13.666 --> 26:15.791
I hope it's the door.

26:30.250 --> 26:32.666
But furs? She hated furs.

26:32.708 --> 26:35.625
And what are they doing
in a shop? They're not new.

26:35.666 --> 26:38.875
The lawyers put them
in cold storage.

26:45.166 --> 26:49.750
I'd give up everything I have
for a little bright suit
and suede accessories.

26:51.375 --> 26:52.583
Come on.

26:59.958 --> 27:01.458
I'd give up everything.

27:11.875 --> 27:15.833
Oh, Rose,
can you smell bluebells?

27:18.583 --> 27:20.500
I can smell heaven.

27:29.500 --> 27:31.791
I'll take a dozen pairs, please.

27:34.333 --> 27:35.875
Rose!

27:35.916 --> 27:37.958
Come on.

27:44.750 --> 27:47.833
-I look like a bear.

27:47.875 --> 27:51.666
It is bear, madam,
and young madam's is monkey.

27:54.375 --> 27:56.916
How much do you think
they're worth?

27:57.916 --> 27:59.333
If I might point out, madam,

27:59.375 --> 28:01.916
this is
a high-class department store.

28:01.958 --> 28:04.541
We do not deal
in second-hand goods.

28:04.583 --> 28:09.916
We only refrigerate
the furs of favored clients.

28:09.958 --> 28:12.875
Aunt Millicent had a house
full of beautiful things.

28:12.916 --> 28:14.875
Why did she have
to leave us these?

28:14.916 --> 28:17.291
She was never the same
after Father married Topaz.

28:17.333 --> 28:19.291
When they were cutting the cake,
she said to me,

28:19.333 --> 28:22.458
"They have married for love,
and one can only pray for them."

28:31.041 --> 28:32.708
No, Simon...

28:32.750 --> 28:34.875
My God, Neil and Simon Cotton

28:34.916 --> 28:36.833
are standing on the platform.

28:40.666 --> 28:43.041
I look a sight
and you look a sight!

28:43.083 --> 28:46.166
We've got two bags of leftovers
from a line's corner house.

28:46.208 --> 28:48.791
I'm going to die of shame.

28:48.833 --> 28:50.833
Help me, help me, help me.

28:50.875 --> 28:52.541
Through the bushes.

28:56.250 --> 28:58.250
My darlings.

28:58.291 --> 29:00.041
Mother.

29:00.083 --> 29:02.166
How are you?

29:02.208 --> 29:05.250
Simon, dear, was that
supposed to be first class?

29:05.291 --> 29:08.125
The seating was covered
in the most indescribable...

29:08.166 --> 29:10.000
Mind the milk churns.

29:15.291 --> 29:16.666
What was that?

29:30.875 --> 29:36.375
I see what it is!
Ladies and gentlemen...

29:37.500 --> 29:38.541
it's a bear...

29:39.958 --> 29:41.541
and it's been
scavenging for food.

29:41.583 --> 29:44.625
Neil, we are in
Suffolk, England.

29:44.666 --> 29:46.541
Did you ever go hunting
in Yellowstone Park?

29:46.583 --> 29:48.625
Did you ever see a grizzly
hug a guy to death?

29:48.666 --> 29:50.166
-No, dear.
-Neil...

29:50.208 --> 29:52.083
I'm telling you,
I've seen a bear.

29:52.125 --> 29:54.875
The circus has just arrived.
It must have escaped.

29:54.916 --> 29:57.166
It'll be heading
towards the village.

29:57.208 --> 29:59.125
Come on, do something.

29:59.166 --> 30:01.958
Listen, everybody,
in the waiting room now.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.333
Come along. You too, madam.
Into the waiting room.

30:08.875 --> 30:10.208
Quickly, come along!

30:10.250 --> 30:12.583
Miss Cassandra! Miss Rose!

30:17.458 --> 30:19.541
Bears are
very cunning creatures.

30:19.583 --> 30:21.375
Don't let the dog go
until I say.

30:21.416 --> 30:23.291
-Okay.

30:23.333 --> 30:26.041
He tried to head
away from the railway line.

30:26.083 --> 30:28.916
Simon, lead your party
over to the right

30:28.958 --> 30:30.958
and fan out
in the direction of that church.

30:31.000 --> 30:35.208
Come on, come on, get moving.
Go.

30:35.250 --> 30:37.375
I'll go this way.

30:44.083 --> 30:46.208
Rose?

30:47.291 --> 30:48.666
Rose!

30:50.708 --> 30:52.458
Oh, oh, my sister!

30:52.500 --> 30:54.083
Go back to the station.

30:54.125 --> 30:55.458
Go back to the station!

30:55.500 --> 30:57.041
Wait for me there.

31:14.375 --> 31:15.708
Rose!

31:15.750 --> 31:17.333
Stand back.
Let her get some air.

31:17.375 --> 31:19.458
-In a state of shock.

31:19.500 --> 31:21.333
We must take her home
in our car.

31:21.375 --> 31:24.833
-Killed it.

31:26.250 --> 31:28.208
It was thrashing
and rolling in the river,

31:28.250 --> 31:30.375
and trying to get out,
so I took the pitchfork

31:30.416 --> 31:32.000
and I shoved it in its neck,

31:32.041 --> 31:34.125
right in the jugular,
first time,

31:34.166 --> 31:37.833
then it twitched all over
and foamed a little
at the mouth,

31:37.875 --> 31:40.958
and then it groaned,
then it died.

31:42.458 --> 31:44.833
She had a very lucky escape.

31:46.750 --> 31:49.541
Neil, be careful with her.

31:49.583 --> 31:53.291
Stephen, what happened to her?

31:53.333 --> 31:55.375
My lantern went out.

31:57.000 --> 31:58.375
I'm taking you home.

32:01.125 --> 32:02.458
So he grabbed my arm

32:02.500 --> 32:04.541
and said,
"Why are you running away?"

32:04.583 --> 32:07.583
And I said, "Because I didn't
want to see you

32:07.625 --> 32:10.291
or your stupid
bearded brother, either."

32:10.333 --> 32:14.125
-"In fact, you can
both go to hell."

32:14.166 --> 32:15.583
And I slapped his face.

32:15.625 --> 32:18.208
Oh, Rose, what have you done?

32:18.250 --> 32:20.041
I'll tell you what I've done.

32:20.083 --> 32:23.166
I've got us an invitation
to dinner at Scotney.

32:23.208 --> 32:28.583
Mrs. Cotton invited us all,
one week today.

32:28.625 --> 32:30.833
And so
it was all hands to the pump.

32:30.875 --> 32:35.166
Topaz, haunted by the thought
of Rose's slaps and insults,

32:35.208 --> 32:38.625
has decreed she will dress like
a doll and behave like a lady.

32:38.666 --> 32:42.250
You'll need to learn a slow fox,
a quick-step, a tango,

32:42.291 --> 32:43.916
and how to smoke.

32:43.958 --> 32:46.375
Can't I just do
something sparkling with a fan?

32:46.416 --> 32:50.083
No. I'm already
regretting the crinoline.

32:50.125 --> 32:53.541
One can overdo Victorian charm.

33:02.583 --> 33:05.625
I keep picturing us walking.

33:07.250 --> 33:11.750
I put bluebells in
to get myself in practice,

33:11.791 --> 33:15.083
then I add twilight
and give us things to say.

33:15.125 --> 33:20.375
-It's getting dark.
-I won't let the flame go out.

33:20.416 --> 33:26.708
-I can smell heaven.

33:26.750 --> 33:30.875
And there my imagination
always fails completely.

33:30.916 --> 33:34.500
I obviously don't want
to kiss him at all...

33:37.166 --> 33:38.583
or do I?

33:38.625 --> 33:42.000
Your face has gone really,
really red.

33:55.875 --> 33:57.958
Come on, then.

33:58.000 --> 33:59.458
I'm sorry.

34:00.541 --> 34:03.708
I've changed my mind.

34:03.750 --> 34:07.916
Anyway, it's rubbish about him
looking like a Greek god.

34:09.458 --> 34:11.458
From now on,
I am going to concentrate

34:11.500 --> 34:13.958
on Rose's quest for love.

34:14.000 --> 34:16.208
We have put the rumba
into our repertoire,

34:16.250 --> 34:18.250
just to be on the safe side.

34:27.083 --> 34:29.833
I was too forthcoming
when they came to call.

34:29.875 --> 34:32.125
I think the problem
was mostly with the tea gown.

34:32.166 --> 34:36.041
What do you mean, the problem's
mostly with the tea gown?

34:36.083 --> 34:38.666
I heard Neil
talking to Simon that day.

34:38.708 --> 34:41.000
I was in the hayloft.

34:41.041 --> 34:42.833
What did he say?

34:42.875 --> 34:44.625
What did he say?

34:46.208 --> 34:52.291
He called you an insane broad
in theatrical costume.

34:52.333 --> 34:54.333
He wanted Simon to drop us.

34:54.375 --> 34:56.708
He did, did he?

34:56.750 --> 35:00.458
Well, I shan't forth come again.

35:03.458 --> 35:06.333
-Hold still.
-I'm holding still.

35:06.375 --> 35:07.708
I thought we'd sold this.

35:07.750 --> 35:09.833
They were only pawned.
I got them back.

35:11.125 --> 35:14.708
Are you wearing lipstick
and powder and rouge?

35:14.750 --> 35:17.500
-It makes you look ordinary.
-I mean it to.

35:17.541 --> 35:20.958
I want us to look
like a viable family,
Mortmain, for Rose's sake.

35:21.000 --> 35:22.791
I don't want to look
exceptional tonight.

35:22.833 --> 35:25.416
If you look exceptional,
I look like someone, too.

35:25.458 --> 35:27.583
You are someone.

35:29.500 --> 35:31.750
Wash your face. Please.

35:31.791 --> 35:36.291
Unpin your hair, give me
something to be proud of.

36:11.208 --> 36:13.708
-Thank you.

36:19.583 --> 36:21.000
Welcome.

36:23.375 --> 36:26.333
It was a
highly intellectual gathering.

36:26.375 --> 36:29.666
Aubrey Fox-Cotton
is a cousin and an architect.

36:29.708 --> 36:31.291
He recognized Topaz at once

36:31.333 --> 36:33.208
from a series
of avant-garde etchings

36:33.250 --> 36:35.000
she once modeled for.

36:35.041 --> 36:37.708
She was terribly glad
she had taken her disguise off.

36:37.750 --> 36:40.625
I take it you've tasted your
first champagne this evening.

36:40.666 --> 36:44.166
One of life's nicer
rites of passage.

36:44.208 --> 36:45.958
What do you think?

36:46.000 --> 36:50.541
It reminds me of very good
ginger beer, without the ginger.

36:51.708 --> 36:53.208
Sweet.

36:53.250 --> 36:55.083
His wife is called Leda.

36:55.125 --> 36:57.208
She wears too much lipstick.

37:00.083 --> 37:01.791
Are you appalled
by my table manners?

37:01.833 --> 37:03.541
Oh...

37:03.583 --> 37:05.083
I just couldn't get the hang
of using all this cutlery

37:05.125 --> 37:07.166
the English way.
Of course, Mother and Simon

37:07.208 --> 37:09.291
find the whole thing
divinely elegant.

37:09.333 --> 37:11.625
I tried it, but I thought I was
going to starve to death.

37:11.666 --> 37:13.416
When this
hall was originally built,

37:13.458 --> 37:15.583
its occupants ate
with daggers in their fingers.

37:15.625 --> 37:17.083
It'll probably last
until the days

37:17.125 --> 37:18.833
when men dine on capsules.

37:18.875 --> 37:21.791
Fancy asking friends over
for capsules.

37:21.833 --> 37:25.083
-No, the capsules will
be taken in private.

37:27.166 --> 37:28.958
Well, by that time,

37:29.000 --> 37:30.750
eating will become
unmentionable,

37:30.791 --> 37:34.041
pictures of food will be
considered rare and curious

37:34.083 --> 37:36.500
and only collected
by rude, old gentlemen.

37:38.833 --> 37:41.333
When I was in the United States,
on my second lecture tour,

37:41.375 --> 37:45.125
they held a banquet for me
in a place called Boulder--

37:45.166 --> 37:49.250
Mr. Mortmain,
how long is it since
you actually published anything?

37:57.750 --> 38:00.000
Twelve years.

38:00.041 --> 38:04.750
Is it drink, or do you have
psychological problems?

38:04.791 --> 38:06.416
-Mother!

38:06.458 --> 38:09.125
Well, he didn't get up
and run out of the room...

38:10.791 --> 38:13.875
or attack me with a knife.

38:13.916 --> 38:17.541
Malicious wounding.
Not quite a capital offense.

38:17.583 --> 38:19.541
If your assault
had been more competent,

38:19.583 --> 38:22.791
I should have been obliged
to bar my door.

38:26.666 --> 38:30.333
Or send your youngest son
after me with a pitchfork.

38:44.833 --> 38:48.416
I always employ shock tactics
with men of genius.

38:48.458 --> 38:50.125
One has to employ them
in public,

38:50.166 --> 38:51.791
or the men of genius bolt.

38:51.833 --> 38:54.625
Tell me, are you unique,
or have all American women

38:54.666 --> 38:56.458
become more menacing of late?

38:56.500 --> 38:59.916
You'll find me as menacing
as I need to be, Mr. Mortmain.

38:59.958 --> 39:02.666
Your voice has been
silenced long enough.

39:02.708 --> 39:03.875
Well, that's because
there can be

39:03.916 --> 39:05.791
no creativity without stimulus.

39:05.833 --> 39:08.833
I'm glad we're
of the same opinion.

39:10.916 --> 39:12.500
You're treading on my feet.

39:12.541 --> 39:14.666
So stop making up
your own steps.

39:14.708 --> 39:16.500
I didn't ask
to dance with you.

39:16.541 --> 39:18.500
You could have refused me.

39:23.208 --> 39:26.291
Thank you.

39:26.333 --> 39:30.000
Thank you. Would you like to
come out to the terrace with me?

39:30.041 --> 39:32.625
-We could take a little air.
-I'm not hot.

39:32.666 --> 39:35.416
Besides, it's a slow dance next.

39:35.458 --> 39:38.666
-It is not. It's a rumba.

39:38.708 --> 39:41.291
And I promised it to Simon.

39:48.916 --> 39:51.083
I should have to ask you
to rein me in on this one,

39:51.125 --> 39:55.125
I've been told I rumba
like a rubber ball.

40:11.583 --> 40:14.000
You're much better at leading
than your brother.

40:14.041 --> 40:16.125
Oh, am I?

40:18.208 --> 40:20.666
That's a really unusual
dress you have on.

40:20.708 --> 40:23.000
You mean,
you think it's theatrical?

40:23.041 --> 40:26.000
Oh, no. No, no, no.

40:26.041 --> 40:28.583
Picturesque and original,
certainly,

40:28.625 --> 40:30.875
but not theatrical at all.

40:35.125 --> 40:36.875
Get down.

40:38.125 --> 40:39.708
Go home.

40:40.791 --> 40:43.583
Rose? Rose.

40:46.291 --> 40:49.500
Stephen

40:56.625 --> 40:59.250
-You'll be all right.
-I'm sure I'll be fine.

40:59.291 --> 41:01.416
You come along with me.
We'll get you patched up.

41:01.458 --> 41:03.250
Thank you.

41:05.041 --> 41:06.500
Do they make you nervous?

41:06.541 --> 41:09.291
-My family.

41:10.875 --> 41:12.916
I think they're
a very charming,

41:12.958 --> 41:15.333
highly individual bunch of...

41:16.958 --> 41:18.375
individuals.

41:21.250 --> 41:23.250
They make me nervous.

41:35.458 --> 41:37.166
Would you like to try it?

41:38.666 --> 41:40.125
Go right ahead.

41:51.541 --> 41:54.291
[playing "The Very
Thought of You" as a slow rag]

42:16.083 --> 42:18.041
I don't suppose
I'd have much of an appetite

42:18.083 --> 42:20.375
if I was actually concussed.

42:23.708 --> 42:25.875
Where've you been?

42:25.916 --> 42:28.500
We were in the long gallery,
looking at pictures.

42:28.541 --> 42:33.041
Never mind all that
tedious ancestor worship.

42:33.083 --> 42:34.750
I'm going to photograph this.

42:34.791 --> 42:36.041
Would you like some water?

42:36.083 --> 42:38.250
Stephen, this is my card.

42:38.291 --> 42:40.708
Five guineas a pop.

42:40.750 --> 42:42.291
I'd like you to consider it.

42:43.833 --> 42:46.291
Thank you. I will.

42:49.875 --> 42:53.583
You aren't going to go,
are you?

42:53.625 --> 42:55.958
It's just, I mean...

42:56.000 --> 42:57.750
Five guineas.

42:57.791 --> 43:00.583
That'll buy a fair few pounds
of whole nut.

43:00.625 --> 43:03.375
Stephen,
can I get you anything else?

43:03.416 --> 43:06.458
Sir William always used to
send us a ham at Christmas.

43:06.500 --> 43:08.208
It was great.
He missed last year.

43:08.250 --> 43:09.416
Thomas...

43:14.875 --> 43:15.916
Here.

43:23.541 --> 43:26.208
Rose hasn't said a word
since we got in.

43:26.250 --> 43:29.125
I am going to pretend I don't
care what she's thinking.

43:29.166 --> 43:31.666
Can I tell you something?

43:36.708 --> 43:38.416
When we got back
to the dining room,

43:38.458 --> 43:40.916
I suddenly imagined
being in bed with Simon.

43:40.958 --> 43:44.583
-You didn't.
-You wouldn't understand.

43:44.625 --> 43:46.041
No.

43:48.000 --> 43:51.750
-It was peculiar, but bearable.

43:51.791 --> 43:55.250
-I sort of skirted around it.

43:55.291 --> 43:57.583
If only I could
get him to shave.

43:57.625 --> 44:01.375
Wouldn't you rather have Neil?
He's got a nice clean face.

44:01.416 --> 44:04.458
No, I wouldn't rather have Neil.
You can have Neil.

44:04.500 --> 44:07.583
I'd marry Simon
even if I hated him.

44:07.625 --> 44:11.416
Oh, God, I've never seen
anything more beautiful

44:11.458 --> 44:13.625
than Mrs. Cotton's bathroom.

44:13.666 --> 44:15.708
Peach colored towels!

44:15.750 --> 44:18.708
Rose, there isn't a towel
on earth that could make up

44:18.750 --> 44:21.583
for marrying a bearded man
that you hate.

44:21.625 --> 44:24.833
-But I don't hate him.
-You're not in love with him.

44:24.875 --> 44:28.166
I want to be. You have no idea
how much I want to be.

44:28.208 --> 44:32.375
I don't know why I'm excited,
or what it is I really feel.

44:32.416 --> 44:35.875
Perhaps if you...
kissed or something.

44:35.916 --> 44:38.500
I'm not going to let him
until after he's proposed,

44:38.541 --> 44:42.166
otherwise,
he might just kiss me and run
and not propose at all.

44:42.208 --> 44:44.291
Why would he do that?

44:45.416 --> 44:47.625
I wish we knew more about men.

44:47.666 --> 44:51.208
I keep trying to imagine
what Mother would say.

44:51.250 --> 44:54.750
There must be signs
you can study,
signals you can read.

44:58.458 --> 45:00.333
I think I realized then

45:00.375 --> 45:05.375
how little we have to go on,
how desperate we are,

45:05.416 --> 45:09.833
and that the thing we know least
about of all is being women.

45:12.958 --> 45:17.250
Three teas, two luncheons...

45:17.291 --> 45:19.791
It's only been five days
since we went there for dinner.

45:19.833 --> 45:23.333
I just wish you'd tell me
what you and Mrs. Cotton
find to talk about.

45:23.375 --> 45:25.333
We do not talk about anything.

45:25.375 --> 45:27.041
We converse
and that's different.

45:27.083 --> 45:30.458
Elizabeth is an extremely
stimulating woman.

45:30.500 --> 45:35.625
-Oh, that bloody hound.
-Clothes brush
is on the dresser.

45:35.666 --> 45:38.541
Is there nowhere a man in dark
trousers can sit in this house?

45:38.583 --> 45:40.375
And why are you wearing
your London Suit?

45:40.416 --> 45:42.291
Because I'm going to London.

45:42.333 --> 45:44.875
Do you want me
to start writing again,
or don't you?

45:46.083 --> 45:49.666
I knew it.
She's inspiring him.

45:49.708 --> 45:51.916
His temper has
been getting worse.

45:51.958 --> 45:54.750
God, I'd let him
tear me limb from limb

45:54.791 --> 45:56.666
if I thought
it would unleash him.

46:04.541 --> 46:06.541
I hope I'm not tempting fate.

46:06.583 --> 46:11.541
I keep imagining
Rose's honeymoon... in Paris.

46:13.833 --> 46:19.500
I put flowers by the bed
and think about her, waiting.

46:19.541 --> 46:24.041
I can't decide between a pink
negligee with swan's down trim,

46:24.083 --> 46:27.750
or duchesse satin
in classic eau de Nil...

46:30.250 --> 46:34.125
But she's always
just a tiny bit afraid.

46:48.875 --> 46:51.750
Is this your playhouse?

46:51.791 --> 46:55.125
It's, um...
It's where I come to write.

46:55.166 --> 46:57.791
Like father, like daughter.

46:57.833 --> 47:01.583
Except I've written 147 pages.

47:01.625 --> 47:04.875
It can't help him that rain
pours through his study roof.

47:04.916 --> 47:08.208
I'm suspending the rent
until I've had it repaired.

47:09.291 --> 47:11.125
Is Rose at home today?

47:11.166 --> 47:14.625
She's gone to the village
to buy soap.

47:15.750 --> 47:17.541
Shall we walk over there?

47:20.291 --> 47:22.458
I'm sure he was never
going to stab mother,

47:22.500 --> 47:24.250
but it must have
looked quite bad

47:24.291 --> 47:25.875
to the next-door neighbor,
because he jumped the fence

47:25.916 --> 47:28.625
and tried to grab
the knife off Father.

47:28.666 --> 47:30.250
The neighbor got
punched in the stomach

47:30.291 --> 47:32.041
and Father got four months.

47:32.083 --> 47:33.416
And then he stopped writing.

47:33.458 --> 47:36.958
And started reading
detective novels.

47:37.000 --> 47:39.208
Well, I can't work it out.

47:39.250 --> 47:40.958
He's a complete mystery
all on his own:

47:41.000 --> 47:43.250
-"The Case
of the Buried Talent."

47:43.291 --> 47:45.791
You know, he should
really see an analyst.

47:45.833 --> 47:48.041
-Yes.

47:48.083 --> 47:50.208
The right person
could take him back
to the time he spent in jail

47:50.250 --> 47:54.333
and find out why
there's still a part of him
imprisoned, locked up.

47:54.375 --> 47:57.333
Oh, he'd never agree to that.

47:57.375 --> 48:00.916
Father says
all psychiatrists are con men.

48:00.958 --> 48:05.541
Besides, it would mean
he'd actually have to
talk to someone.

48:13.625 --> 48:15.916
Well, doesn't this make
the perfect picture?

48:15.958 --> 48:19.791
I feel like I'm painted
on the lid of a candy box.

48:19.833 --> 48:21.958
-They'd run out.

48:22.000 --> 48:25.250
Neil was buying cigarettes.

48:25.291 --> 48:27.500
Would you like a lemonade?

48:27.541 --> 48:29.416
Can't I have the same as Rose?

48:29.458 --> 48:32.833
Creme de menthe.
Of course.

48:32.875 --> 48:36.500
I think your sister chose it
for the contrast with her hair.

48:36.541 --> 48:39.791
No, no.
Just there, dear.

48:39.833 --> 48:42.291
The colors look so pretty.

48:42.333 --> 48:46.541
Simon, don't get the beer
with the picture
of the hen on it.

48:46.583 --> 48:47.833
Disgusting.

48:47.875 --> 48:49.291
You pick it, I'll buy it.

48:49.333 --> 48:51.375
Neil hates me.

48:51.416 --> 48:54.416
He thinks I'm going
to take Simon away from him.

48:54.458 --> 48:57.416
Do you know, their parents
kept them apart for 14 years.

48:57.458 --> 48:59.041
Did they?

48:59.083 --> 49:00.708
I shan't let him interfere.

49:00.750 --> 49:02.625
I don't care what he wants.

49:16.750 --> 49:19.333
Do you remember that
picnic we went on
with Mother and Pa

49:19.375 --> 49:21.250
when they forgot the food?

49:21.291 --> 49:23.291
Yeah, and we had to
buy it in a shop.

49:23.333 --> 49:25.833
And Mother had to cut the bread
with a nail file.

49:25.875 --> 49:29.500
That, uh...
That was a funny day.

49:29.541 --> 49:33.083
They took us out
because they meant to tell us
they were divorcing,

49:33.125 --> 49:34.916
but they couldn't
in the end, because the chicken

49:34.958 --> 49:37.041
and the plates and the napkins
hadn't been packed.

49:37.083 --> 49:40.208
And they were at a loss
as to how to be civilized.

49:40.250 --> 49:42.083
We never did find out
how they decided

49:42.125 --> 49:44.750
which of them
would take which one of us.

49:44.791 --> 49:46.708
Who would you
have picked, Rose?

49:46.750 --> 49:50.208
I'd have put you both in a home
or sold you to chimney sweep.

50:00.208 --> 50:03.250
I made a mistake with Rose.

50:03.291 --> 50:05.958
I thought she was affected
when I first met her,

50:06.000 --> 50:08.458
artificial
and maybe mannered or something.

50:08.500 --> 50:10.416
She's not.

50:11.458 --> 50:14.458
She's natural and spontaneous.

50:14.500 --> 50:17.625
Quite unlike
anyone I've ever met before.

50:19.375 --> 50:21.333
I suppose she is.

50:24.041 --> 50:26.916
-And so are you.
-No.

50:26.958 --> 50:28.541
I'm really glad
that we met you all.

50:28.583 --> 50:30.666
I'm glad that we came.

50:31.958 --> 50:34.041
Oh, look out!

50:34.083 --> 50:37.875
Have you seen Rose
doing cartwheels

50:37.916 --> 50:40.375
Have you ever seen such
a change in a girl?

50:40.416 --> 50:42.750
Well, this must be
her fresh-air personality.

50:42.791 --> 50:47.291
Yeah, the question is,
how many Roses are there?

51:13.000 --> 51:14.500
How could you?

51:14.541 --> 51:16.625
A gesture of social intercourse.

51:16.666 --> 51:18.416
What are we going
to feed them?

51:18.458 --> 51:20.000
They gave us that ham.

51:20.041 --> 51:22.416
We haven't got a decent table
to eat it off.

51:22.458 --> 51:23.875
There are doors.

51:23.916 --> 51:25.458
They can be
taken off their hinges.

51:27.125 --> 51:29.500
You're father's invited
the Cottons to dinner.

51:29.541 --> 51:30.875
All of them?

51:30.916 --> 51:32.750
And the Fox-Cottons
and the vicar.

51:32.791 --> 51:35.083
He's been in London with her.
Elizabeth.

51:35.125 --> 51:38.083
They've had an assignation
at the British Museum.

51:38.125 --> 51:41.333
Elizabeth is my patroness.
We were doing some research.

51:41.375 --> 51:45.000
Oh, people use that place
for nothing but assignations.

51:45.041 --> 51:50.791
I used to meet you there myself
when was married to Eduardo,
in the Mummy Room.

51:53.250 --> 51:56.583
It can't be done,
and we're so, so close

51:56.625 --> 51:58.541
to the only thing
that's going to save us.

51:58.583 --> 52:00.333
Should we try
to get the dinner cancelled?

52:00.375 --> 52:02.625
No. Don't you see?

52:02.666 --> 52:06.000
Simon has to propose to me now,
before he meets somebody else,

52:06.041 --> 52:08.041
or gets to know me better.

52:08.083 --> 52:10.208
If only I could get him
on his own again.

52:11.458 --> 52:12.583
You will.

52:12.625 --> 52:14.666
I promise you, you will.

52:20.458 --> 52:22.000
They didn't seem to notice

52:22.041 --> 52:24.208
it was their ham
we were serving...

52:28.750 --> 52:31.541
or that they got
the biggest portions.

52:31.583 --> 52:34.500
Tell me, James,
did our visit to the Mummy Room

52:34.541 --> 52:37.041
Oh. Well...

52:37.083 --> 52:41.291
Would you believe it,
Mrs. Mortmain, we came across
two mummies in separate cases,

52:41.333 --> 52:43.375
who were actually
husband and wife.

52:43.416 --> 52:45.958
Meticulous hieroglyphs
told the whole story.

52:46.000 --> 52:48.458
There they were on opposite
sides of the room,

52:48.500 --> 52:53.458
gazing mutely at each other,
with their barriers of glass.

52:53.500 --> 52:55.958
I've known marriages like that.

53:00.333 --> 53:02.166
You see the pity of it is,

53:02.208 --> 53:04.458
Mrs. Mortmain,
I haven't designed a building

53:04.500 --> 53:07.708
that's satisfied me
in 15 years.

53:08.875 --> 53:10.416
I'm hoping to persuade Simon

53:10.458 --> 53:14.000
to let me remodel Scotney,
or this place.

53:14.041 --> 53:17.000
You know, I've never even seen
beyond the ground floor here,

53:17.041 --> 53:19.583
I've been waiting
for a guided tour.

53:19.625 --> 53:21.750
I'll show you around.

53:21.791 --> 53:24.041
Let's go up on the battlements.

53:24.083 --> 53:25.666
That is a great idea.

53:25.708 --> 53:27.291
Do let me join you.

53:27.333 --> 53:28.958
It's a cloudless night,

53:29.000 --> 53:31.291
and I haven't seen
the Pleiades in ages.

53:31.333 --> 53:34.125
Oh, such a soft
little constellation.

53:34.166 --> 53:37.625
I prefer something
much more angular.

53:39.125 --> 53:43.333
Something is dampening your
fire, Mrs. Mortmain.

53:43.375 --> 53:48.583
My fire dies when it is
not required... Aubrey.

53:48.625 --> 53:51.625
The besieging force
would have a great, big sling

53:51.666 --> 53:54.250
known as a trebuchet,
and they would use it

53:54.291 --> 53:56.375
to fire rocks
over the ramparts.

53:56.416 --> 53:58.500
This is not what he meant
when he asked for a guided tour.

53:58.541 --> 54:00.416
Can't you trip over
your skirt or something?

54:00.458 --> 54:02.583
He'd have to grab
your arm to steady you.
It'd be a start.

54:02.625 --> 54:04.416
You promised me
I'd get to be alone with him.

54:04.458 --> 54:07.625
-It's out of my hands.
-You promised.

54:09.958 --> 54:12.250
Would anybody like to bathe?

54:14.708 --> 54:18.375
It'll be like being
disemboweled with an ice ax.

54:18.416 --> 54:20.125
Rubbish.

54:21.375 --> 54:23.916
We keep them up here
to stop the drafts.

54:26.833 --> 54:30.416
There's only one pair,
unfortunately.

54:30.458 --> 54:32.625
Why don't you wait here
for your turn?

54:34.125 --> 54:36.833
Come on.

54:36.875 --> 54:38.500
I don't know
if these are going to fit.

54:38.541 --> 54:40.666
Oh, stop worrying.

54:47.250 --> 54:50.000
Stand by
for beautiful accompaniment.

54:50.041 --> 54:51.458
Wow, this is like Alaska!

54:51.500 --> 54:53.166
Well,
I want to see you suffer too,

54:53.208 --> 54:55.458
or I'm going
straight back inside.

55:00.416 --> 55:01.625
Well done.

55:09.875 --> 55:13.083
Now that really is romantic.

55:13.125 --> 55:15.333
It's a shame
we're not in love

55:15.375 --> 55:18.958
-and that it's so darn cold.
-It's fine if you keep moving.

55:27.000 --> 55:28.500
Are you okay?

55:28.541 --> 55:31.250
It's a bit weedy just here,
that's all.

55:32.416 --> 55:34.833
Oh, for Christ's sake,
Cassandra.

55:39.708 --> 55:43.666
-No, I'm really enjoying it.

55:43.708 --> 55:45.541
Look at the moon.

55:47.250 --> 55:50.583
Come on,
before we catch pneumonia.

55:53.000 --> 55:54.958
The towels are upstairs.

55:56.458 --> 55:58.000
Wait for me in the kitchen.

56:11.041 --> 56:13.125
Will you kiss me now?

56:34.583 --> 56:41.083
-Kiss me, then I'll tell you.

56:54.291 --> 56:57.791
You're all wet. You're all wet.

56:59.458 --> 57:02.625
Say something, brother.

57:02.666 --> 57:06.291
Rose, I'm sure you know
everything I'm wishing you.

57:14.416 --> 57:16.166
You took me swimming
deliberately.

57:16.208 --> 57:17.833
Well, of course I did.

57:17.875 --> 57:19.875
You might try and be
a bit happy for them.

57:19.916 --> 57:22.291
Will you just get
the hell out of here
and let me get dressed?

57:22.333 --> 57:26.708
Only if you tell me
why you don't like Rose.

57:26.750 --> 57:29.458
Because she's a gold digger.

57:29.500 --> 57:30.875
She is not.

57:30.916 --> 57:33.166
She is,
and you damn well know it,

57:33.208 --> 57:34.708
and you're no better.

57:36.000 --> 57:37.458
How... How dare you?

57:37.500 --> 57:40.000
How dare I do what?
Tell the truth?

57:47.666 --> 57:50.125
-Goodbye!
-Goodbye!

57:51.458 --> 57:55.291
-Farewell!
-Bye!

57:55.333 --> 57:57.375
See you soon!

58:11.500 --> 58:14.083
Oh, it's such relief.

58:15.166 --> 58:17.083
I thought we'd
never pull it off.

58:17.125 --> 58:21.041
No, the relief is that
I'm in love with him.

58:22.500 --> 58:23.958
Was it the kiss that did it?

58:24.000 --> 58:26.791
A kiss can do a lot of things.

58:30.125 --> 58:32.166
Oh, don't cry.

58:32.208 --> 58:34.333
Please don't cry.

58:35.666 --> 58:39.041
I'm going to take
such good care of you all.

58:43.416 --> 58:48.208
And now they've all gone
to arrange a London wedding.

58:48.250 --> 58:50.875
Father went, too,
to keep an eye on Rose,

58:50.916 --> 58:54.708
and Topaz went
to keep an eye on him.

59:01.916 --> 59:04.583
I was miserable for a week.

59:05.625 --> 59:08.750
I wondered if I envied Rose.

59:08.791 --> 59:14.625
I scoured my innermost heart
and realized I just missed her.

59:15.791 --> 59:18.125
She had gone from me for good...

59:21.500 --> 59:24.541
and the thought
of Neil despising her

59:24.583 --> 59:26.958
was more than I could bear.

59:32.083 --> 59:36.000
"Dear Neil...
Rose is in love with Simon.

59:36.041 --> 59:39.333
She offered it up herself
that night after he proposed.

59:39.375 --> 59:43.208
She was once honest enough
to admit that she would
have married him

59:43.250 --> 59:46.708
even if she'd hated him,
so I believe her.

59:46.750 --> 59:50.375
I value her truthfulness,
I hope you value you mine.

59:50.416 --> 59:54.166
And please don't hold
our having been so poor
against her.

59:54.208 --> 59:58.125
With love, your future
sister-in-law, Cassandra."

1:00:01.833 --> 1:00:04.625
"Dear Cassandra,
please draw a picture

1:00:04.666 --> 1:00:07.708
of the bridesmaid's dress
you want and send it by return.

1:00:07.750 --> 1:00:10.416
Topaz keeps coming up
with sketches.

1:00:10.458 --> 1:00:12.583
You can imagine
what they're like.

1:00:12.625 --> 1:00:14.875
You won't recognize me soon.

1:00:14.916 --> 1:00:17.083
I've been taken in hand.

1:00:17.125 --> 1:00:20.625
I have a permanent wave,
and my own account at Simpson's.

1:00:20.666 --> 1:00:25.083
The shop smelled
exactly the same,
like heaven and bluebells.

1:00:25.125 --> 1:00:29.250
And I saw that assistant
who said they didn't deal
in second-hand goods.

1:00:29.291 --> 1:00:31.166
She was all smiles this time."

1:00:31.208 --> 1:00:35.000
I've always wanted
a daughter to dress.

1:00:35.041 --> 1:00:40.666
"I kept wishing you were
here... or I was there.

1:00:43.166 --> 1:00:46.958
By the time you get this,
it will be Midsummer's Eve.

1:00:47.000 --> 1:00:49.250
Will you do the pagan rites?

1:00:49.291 --> 1:00:52.541
Will you do them one last time
for my sake?"

1:01:27.416 --> 1:01:30.625
I was in no man's land.

1:01:30.666 --> 1:01:32.541
I knew that when dusk fell,

1:01:32.583 --> 1:01:36.333
I'd be doing something childish
for the final time.

1:01:37.958 --> 1:01:40.250
Meanwhile, I told myself

1:01:40.291 --> 1:01:44.083
sunbathing naked
was a prelude to the rites.

1:01:45.791 --> 1:01:49.958
But I couldn't explain the
thrill in the pit of my stomach,

1:01:50.000 --> 1:01:52.916
the tight, coiled feeling.

1:01:56.166 --> 1:01:58.958
Was I rehearsing something?

1:02:26.541 --> 1:02:28.291
Don't go too close.

1:02:29.708 --> 1:02:32.166
Hi. Flying visit.

1:02:32.208 --> 1:02:33.583
I have business on the estate.

1:02:33.625 --> 1:02:35.416
Has Rose come home?

1:02:35.458 --> 1:02:37.750
She had a fitting
for her wedding dress.

1:02:40.416 --> 1:02:42.333
Are you all alone, too?

1:02:43.833 --> 1:02:46.541
I did this with Rose
every summer.

1:02:46.583 --> 1:02:49.791
It started as a game,
but after a while,

1:02:49.833 --> 1:02:52.666
we really did think
the gods could hear us.

1:02:52.708 --> 1:02:55.291
We never dared
not do it after that.

1:02:56.625 --> 1:02:58.000
Of course, Mother panicked

1:02:58.041 --> 1:03:00.458
if we danced
too near the flames.

1:03:01.625 --> 1:03:04.750
And then she died,
and the next year,

1:03:04.791 --> 1:03:08.541
we danced even nearer
and went wild.

1:03:08.583 --> 1:03:10.500
Rose told me.

1:03:13.083 --> 1:03:14.458
You miss her?

1:03:14.500 --> 1:03:18.208
It seems wrong
when she's so happy.

1:03:18.250 --> 1:03:23.041
When I first saw Neil
after Father's funeral,
it was amazing.

1:03:23.083 --> 1:03:24.875
We talked all the time.

1:03:24.916 --> 1:03:27.833
We stayed up all night talking,

1:03:27.875 --> 1:03:31.375
and now sometimes we sit
not saying anything at all.

1:03:31.416 --> 1:03:35.625
-Rose and I used to do that.

1:03:35.666 --> 1:03:38.916
I don't know. Having someone
else around is new to me.

1:03:38.958 --> 1:03:42.291
I was pretty much an only child
for years after the divorce.

1:03:44.666 --> 1:03:47.333
So much was messed up.

1:03:47.375 --> 1:03:49.916
I really want to get it right
this time.

1:03:54.125 --> 1:03:56.250
Would you like to see
how we finished?

1:03:57.583 --> 1:03:59.416
On a ceremonial cry?

1:03:59.458 --> 1:04:00.791
Please.

1:04:00.833 --> 1:04:04.041
-Don't you dare laugh.
-Never.

1:04:11.583 --> 1:04:13.166
May I?

1:04:43.833 --> 1:04:46.416
I thought Rose would
love Debussy,

1:04:46.458 --> 1:04:48.333
but I took her
to the Wickmore Hall last week

1:04:48.375 --> 1:04:53.791
and she sat there looking...
not bored exactly, just blank.

1:04:53.833 --> 1:04:56.875
She seemed further away then
than she does now.

1:04:58.875 --> 1:05:02.291
-It's beautiful.

1:05:03.458 --> 1:05:05.916
Makes me think of "Dover Beach."

1:05:05.958 --> 1:05:09.583
We are here upon
A darkling plain

1:05:10.750 --> 1:05:13.625
It's called
"Au Clair de Lune."

1:05:13.666 --> 1:05:15.583
"By the Light of the Moon."

1:05:20.291 --> 1:05:22.625
You're much, much more clever

1:05:22.666 --> 1:05:25.416
than such a pretty girl
has a right to be.

1:05:27.458 --> 1:05:31.541
I look a lot prettier when
I'm not standing next to Rose.

1:05:35.041 --> 1:05:38.291
We talk an awful lot about Rose,
don't we?

1:05:38.333 --> 1:05:41.750
I suppose she's the thing
we have in common.

1:05:52.916 --> 1:05:54.375
It's getting late.

1:05:55.583 --> 1:05:57.166
I'll drive you home soon.

1:06:05.875 --> 1:06:07.375
["You and the Night
and the Music" playing]

1:06:07.416 --> 1:06:09.791
But would you dance
with me first, Cassandra?

1:06:11.500 --> 1:06:12.916
Please?

1:06:45.666 --> 1:06:47.875
Does this have a name?

1:06:49.041 --> 1:06:51.333
This tune.

1:06:54.833 --> 1:06:59.458
It's called "You and the Night
and the Music."

1:07:03.333 --> 1:07:04.833
I don't...

1:07:04.875 --> 1:07:07.041
Don't say anything.

1:07:34.041 --> 1:07:36.708
I don't make a habit
of this sort of thing.

1:07:38.333 --> 1:07:39.708
Nor do I.

1:07:43.666 --> 1:07:46.000
It was only a kiss, Cassandra.

1:07:46.041 --> 1:07:49.958
-It was my first kiss.
-Oh, my God.

1:07:52.041 --> 1:07:55.250
Well, if it fell short
of your expectation

1:07:55.291 --> 1:07:58.458
in any way, then I apologize,
most sincerely.

1:08:00.625 --> 1:08:04.416
I don't think I'm sophisticated
enough for this.

1:08:07.916 --> 1:08:09.958
I'll drive you home.

1:08:25.291 --> 1:08:26.958
I kissed you, Cassandra,

1:08:27.000 --> 1:08:30.041
because you'd been
so sweet and funny all evening.

1:08:31.041 --> 1:08:32.708
And I wanted to.

1:08:32.750 --> 1:08:36.166
I kissed you, and that's all.

1:08:38.000 --> 1:08:40.000
Don't tell Rose.

1:08:42.041 --> 1:08:44.208
I'm in love with her.

1:08:45.583 --> 1:08:47.916
She's my sister.

1:08:55.583 --> 1:08:58.083
What does he mean, "funny"?

1:08:58.125 --> 1:09:01.708
What does he mean,
"I kissed you, and that's all"?

1:09:01.750 --> 1:09:05.208
Do Americans kiss each other
all the time?

1:09:06.333 --> 1:09:09.625
Does he think
I wanted him to kiss me?

1:09:11.041 --> 1:09:14.291
He belongs to Rose.

1:09:14.333 --> 1:09:18.583
Rose, who said,
"A kiss can do a lot of things."

1:09:18.625 --> 1:09:20.166
Not me.

1:09:20.208 --> 1:09:22.666
I said I'd never fall in love.

1:09:22.708 --> 1:09:25.750
I said love was
a murderous thing.

1:09:25.791 --> 1:09:29.375
It is, and I'm walking on air.

1:09:47.166 --> 1:09:52.958
I hate Rose like poison
in my fantasies.

1:09:53.000 --> 1:09:56.375
Sometimes she comes into the
room and sees us kissing...

1:10:02.125 --> 1:10:04.583
And sometimes she doesn't.

1:10:06.458 --> 1:10:08.708
I don't know which is worse.

1:10:20.166 --> 1:10:21.333
Father!

1:10:21.375 --> 1:10:23.291
Came back on the milk train.

1:10:23.333 --> 1:10:26.458
Saw Stephen at the station,
jacket on, going somewhere.

1:10:26.500 --> 1:10:28.916
We're supposed to be able
to afford shop cake.

1:10:28.958 --> 1:10:31.500
I thought I'd make an effort.
It's my birthday.

1:10:31.541 --> 1:10:33.833
Today

1:10:34.916 --> 1:10:36.166
Eighteen.

1:10:36.208 --> 1:10:37.791
Can't see it, somehow.

1:10:37.833 --> 1:10:40.375
Still remember you
in that perambulator thing.

1:10:41.375 --> 1:10:44.541
-Simon sent his regards.

1:10:44.583 --> 1:10:46.458
Said you kept him greatly
entertained the other night.

1:10:46.500 --> 1:10:48.041
Oh.

1:10:48.083 --> 1:10:51.125
Probably made a change
from worshipping Rose.

1:10:51.166 --> 1:10:54.000
No man on earth
should be so violently in love.

1:10:54.041 --> 1:10:56.166
Puts him at such a disadvantage.

1:10:58.000 --> 1:11:01.291
-The kippers from Saturday.

1:11:01.333 --> 1:11:03.625
-They'd gone off.
-Corporeal transition.

1:11:03.666 --> 1:11:07.583
I need something made of flesh.
Ah.

1:11:27.458 --> 1:11:32.041
I'm shaking and sick with
the things I have imagined.

1:11:36.083 --> 1:11:38.541
The dreams are like a drug.

1:11:39.833 --> 1:11:42.291
The magic doesn't last

1:11:42.333 --> 1:11:46.208
and then the pain
is worse than knives.

1:11:53.958 --> 1:11:55.000
There she is.

1:11:55.041 --> 1:11:56.500
Cassandra!

1:11:59.125 --> 1:12:02.416
♪ Happy birthday to you

1:12:02.458 --> 1:12:05.583
♪ Happy birthday to you

1:12:05.625 --> 1:12:09.125
"The Molecular Evolution
of the Cosmic Universe."

1:12:09.166 --> 1:12:11.541
I've read half of it.
It's quite good.

1:12:14.333 --> 1:12:17.166
Rose remembered.

1:12:19.666 --> 1:12:22.000
It's from Simpson's.

1:12:29.083 --> 1:12:32.333
I had to go to King's Crypt
to get it today.

1:12:32.375 --> 1:12:34.250
I've been saving up.

1:12:40.541 --> 1:12:42.375
It's a wireless!

1:12:42.416 --> 1:12:45.250
Oh, Stephen.

1:12:45.291 --> 1:12:48.500
Thank you.
Oh, thank you.

1:12:48.541 --> 1:12:50.500
It's battery powered.

1:12:52.041 --> 1:12:54.041
Oh, Stephen...

1:12:56.041 --> 1:12:58.708
Here's one from Simon.

1:13:05.000 --> 1:13:06.708
It's a sewing machine.

1:13:13.250 --> 1:13:16.208
It's not.

1:13:16.250 --> 1:13:20.833
It's a gramophone
with integral wireless.

1:13:21.833 --> 1:13:23.416
It's probably main's dependent.

1:13:23.458 --> 1:13:25.166
He'll have forgotten
we don't have electricity.

1:13:28.458 --> 1:13:30.500
It's battery powered, too.

1:13:38.500 --> 1:13:41.125
I'll go
and practice my bowling, then.

1:13:45.375 --> 1:13:47.125
Poor Stephen.

1:13:47.166 --> 1:13:49.166
Be careful, will you?

1:13:49.208 --> 1:13:51.958
Can I tell him the truth?

1:13:52.000 --> 1:13:53.958
Will it hurt?

1:14:03.625 --> 1:14:06.000
Stephen?

1:14:06.041 --> 1:14:09.666
Simon didn't have to work
to buy me a present.

1:14:09.708 --> 1:14:12.875
No, that was my privilege.

1:14:17.000 --> 1:14:20.125
We haven't got a lantern.
It'll get dark.

1:14:20.166 --> 1:14:22.500
You'll have to hold my hand.

1:14:22.541 --> 1:14:24.083
No.

1:14:24.125 --> 1:14:26.291
It'll make us both feel better.

1:14:37.083 --> 1:14:40.458
This isn't why I came, Stephen.

1:15:24.666 --> 1:15:27.458
We mustn't do this.

1:15:27.500 --> 1:15:29.791
Please, don't let me do this.

1:15:36.333 --> 1:15:38.541
I'm not coming after you,
Cassandra.

1:15:38.583 --> 1:15:40.458
I'm not coming after you!

1:15:42.000 --> 1:15:43.750
Why did I let it happen?

1:15:43.791 --> 1:15:45.708
Why did I suddenly
want him to kiss me

1:15:45.750 --> 1:15:48.375
when my whole heart
ached for someone else?

1:15:48.416 --> 1:15:51.250
When I went there
to tell him how I felt?

1:15:51.291 --> 1:15:54.541
I've been cruel to Stephen
and betrayed myself.

1:15:54.583 --> 1:15:57.750
The memory of Simon's kiss
is ruined.

1:15:57.791 --> 1:16:00.625
My future is wretched.

1:16:02.625 --> 1:16:04.583
Yes?

1:16:04.625 --> 1:16:07.000
I'm sorry. It wasn't wrong
if we love each other.

1:16:22.333 --> 1:16:23.708
It's all right.

1:16:23.750 --> 1:16:26.458
You won't even
have to see me for a bit.

1:16:26.500 --> 1:16:28.458
I got a telegram from Leda.

1:16:28.500 --> 1:16:31.333
I've got to go to London,
see a producer
about a film part.

1:16:34.083 --> 1:16:36.250
I'm sorry about the kissing.

1:16:46.333 --> 1:16:48.583
What are you doing?

1:16:50.500 --> 1:16:53.041
There are 2,000 characters
in the Chinese alphabet.

1:16:53.083 --> 1:16:55.291
Willow pattern's distilled
a sweeping saga

1:16:55.333 --> 1:16:58.958
of passion and betrayal
into one perfect
elliptical pictogram.

1:17:00.708 --> 1:17:04.041
I wanted to break it down
at random,

1:17:04.083 --> 1:17:06.416
assess where the meaning
would remain.

1:17:06.458 --> 1:17:09.083
What are we going to do
for plates?

1:17:17.583 --> 1:17:19.208
He's getting worse.

1:17:19.250 --> 1:17:21.750
He has asked for ink twice.

1:17:21.791 --> 1:17:25.458
He's asked at the stores
for colored chalk
and the Dandy.

1:17:29.166 --> 1:17:31.916
I got a letter
from Rose yesterday.

1:17:31.958 --> 1:17:33.333
You didn't say?

1:17:33.375 --> 1:17:34.666
She said not to show you.

1:17:34.708 --> 1:17:36.291
She feels guilty

1:17:36.333 --> 1:17:39.083
at having so much
when you've got nothing.

1:17:40.875 --> 1:17:42.625
"Three pairs

One lavender satin nightgown

1:17:51.000 --> 1:17:54.458
Three whole pages,
then she put a total
at the bottom,

1:17:54.500 --> 1:17:56.583
added up wrong.

1:17:56.625 --> 1:17:59.791
I had to look "marabou"
up in the dictionary,
and "peignoir."

1:17:59.833 --> 1:18:01.375
This isn't like her.

1:18:01.416 --> 1:18:03.541
It isn't like
an engaged person.

1:18:03.583 --> 1:18:06.875
She doesn't mention Simon once,
not once.

1:18:06.916 --> 1:18:08.833
Our wicketkeeper's sister's
getting married,

1:18:08.875 --> 1:18:11.916
then it's
"Gerald, Gerald, Gerald,"
every other word.

1:18:11.958 --> 1:18:17.916
She promised me
she was in love with him
the night they got engaged.

1:18:25.750 --> 1:18:29.000
I can't let her
sacrifice herself.

1:18:30.958 --> 1:18:32.708
Your stop, miss.

1:18:45.875 --> 1:18:49.916
There's going to be
a mezzanine floor
with a circular aperture,

1:18:49.958 --> 1:18:54.041
giving way to the entrance hall,
all glass brick.

1:18:54.083 --> 1:18:56.291
This is the best thing
Aubrey's done in years.

1:18:56.333 --> 1:18:57.666
Where's Rose?

1:18:57.708 --> 1:19:00.583
Matinee, all of them.
Apart from Neil.

1:19:00.625 --> 1:19:03.166
He's moved into an hotel.

1:19:03.208 --> 1:19:05.000
I've had matters to attend to.

1:19:05.041 --> 1:19:09.000
-I've been looking for rooms.

1:19:11.583 --> 1:19:14.541
I can't flourish here,
Cassandra.

1:19:14.583 --> 1:19:17.625
-In this family.

1:19:17.666 --> 1:19:21.708
I thought I could move
your father to great things,
stir all the genius inside him,

1:19:21.750 --> 1:19:24.750
but I couldn't,
and it's paralyzing me.

1:19:24.791 --> 1:19:27.375
He's been terribly
feverish lately.

1:19:27.416 --> 1:19:32.458
Imagine if he wrote something
and you weren't
there to read it.

1:19:32.500 --> 1:19:35.708
Elizabeth Cotton can read it.
He'll show her first.

1:19:37.375 --> 1:19:39.666
I'm going to get cards printed
and put myself about.

1:19:39.708 --> 1:19:43.333
-Not exclusively, no.

1:19:44.750 --> 1:19:46.750
Try to understand.

1:19:46.791 --> 1:19:49.291
I need to be in touch
with artists.

1:19:49.333 --> 1:19:52.666
-Father's an artist.
-Not because of me.

1:19:52.708 --> 1:19:56.333
London used to be my world,
but I'm nearly 30.

1:19:56.375 --> 1:20:00.500
Flesh fades.
I'll lose my place in life
if I don't apply myself.

1:20:00.541 --> 1:20:03.000
Is that all you think
you've got to offer?

1:20:03.041 --> 1:20:05.791
It's the only way I have
to make my mark.

1:20:05.833 --> 1:20:10.791
You've made your mark with us,
Thomas and Rose...

1:20:12.250 --> 1:20:13.750
and me.

1:20:14.833 --> 1:20:16.833
But I'm not your mother.

1:20:31.833 --> 1:20:34.291
Cassandra!

1:20:34.333 --> 1:20:37.083
What a wonderful surprise!

1:20:37.125 --> 1:20:38.916
I thought I'd go insane.

1:20:38.958 --> 1:20:41.125
-Chatter, chatter, chatter.

1:20:41.166 --> 1:20:45.500
You've no idea, and always,
always about the wedding.

1:20:46.958 --> 1:20:50.250
Dorchester tonight
to dine and dance.

1:20:51.458 --> 1:20:53.916
This should fit you.

1:20:53.958 --> 1:20:57.166
I don't wear it anymore.
We bought it off the peg.

1:21:19.083 --> 1:21:21.041
You're looking
very grown up tonight.

1:21:21.083 --> 1:21:23.291
I'm not sure that I approve.

1:21:23.333 --> 1:21:25.625
Rose lent it to me.

1:22:16.833 --> 1:22:20.000
We've been expecting
a breakthrough every day.

1:22:20.041 --> 1:22:23.250
You're his daughter.
That's your prerogative.

1:22:23.291 --> 1:22:28.208
James Mortmain
has done his work, my dear.
The well is dry.

1:22:28.250 --> 1:22:31.166
Of course,
it doesn't matter two pins.

1:22:31.208 --> 1:22:33.583
Now Rose will marry into money.

1:23:15.458 --> 1:23:17.250
I've just seen Neil.

1:23:20.375 --> 1:23:22.208
You are honored.

1:23:32.833 --> 1:23:36.208
Simon,
you know I love that song.
Get them to play it again.

1:23:44.541 --> 1:23:46.291
["You and the Night
and the Music" playing]

1:23:50.416 --> 1:23:54.125
Sorry... Sorry.
Excuse me, sorry.

1:23:55.458 --> 1:23:58.041
["Polka Dots and Moonbeams"
playing]

1:23:58.083 --> 1:24:01.625
There you are.
Now, why aren't you dancing?

1:24:02.875 --> 1:24:05.458
My shoes don't fit.

1:24:05.500 --> 1:24:07.458
Ah.

1:24:07.500 --> 1:24:09.083
Thank you for your letter.

1:24:09.125 --> 1:24:11.833
You did a very necessary thing.

1:24:13.625 --> 1:24:15.125
Come on.

1:24:25.833 --> 1:24:29.000
I suppose we should
get in practice for the wedding.

1:24:29.041 --> 1:24:31.416
A best man, a bridesmaid.

1:24:31.458 --> 1:24:34.125
I'm not going to the wedding.

1:24:34.166 --> 1:24:35.916
Neil...

1:24:35.958 --> 1:24:38.291
Been offered a partnership
on a ranch in California,

1:24:38.333 --> 1:24:41.500
have to be there
to sign the papers next week.

1:24:42.750 --> 1:24:44.333
Nobody said.

1:24:44.375 --> 1:24:46.833
Nobody knows, yet.

1:24:48.500 --> 1:24:51.541
Do you hate England, Neil?

1:24:51.583 --> 1:24:53.041
Do you hate us?

1:24:53.083 --> 1:24:55.958
England's okay.

1:24:56.000 --> 1:24:57.541
You're okay.

1:24:57.583 --> 1:25:01.375
It's me, just all wrong here.

1:25:10.166 --> 1:25:13.125
Put those flowers
in the bathroom for the night,
will you?

1:25:18.541 --> 1:25:21.500
And put that card
in the bedside drawer.

1:25:21.541 --> 1:25:24.708
He sulks if I don't keep
every single one.

1:25:33.208 --> 1:25:37.083
You don't love him at all,
Rose, do you?

1:25:37.125 --> 1:25:40.666
No, I don't believe I do.
It's a shame, really.

1:25:40.708 --> 1:25:42.791
He wears me out.

1:25:42.833 --> 1:25:45.125
Every second of every minute
of every hour
that we're together

1:25:45.166 --> 1:25:47.625
he wants and he wants
and he wants to be loved

1:25:47.666 --> 1:25:50.458
with every fiber of his being.

1:25:50.500 --> 1:25:52.041
I can't explain it.

1:25:53.041 --> 1:25:55.083
You explain it very well.

1:25:57.666 --> 1:26:00.541
Do you want me
to tell him for you?

1:26:02.000 --> 1:26:03.916
Tell him what?

1:26:03.958 --> 1:26:06.750
I'm still going to marry him.

1:26:06.791 --> 1:26:10.458
That's a wicked, wicked,
wicked thing to do.

1:26:10.500 --> 1:26:13.208
More wicked than helping me make
that ludicrous crinoline dress?

1:26:13.250 --> 1:26:15.458
-Oh...
-More wicked
than taking Neil for a swim

1:26:15.500 --> 1:26:17.833
so Simon had a chance
to catch me alone and propose?

1:26:17.875 --> 1:26:20.083
It was like something in a book,
a game.

1:26:20.125 --> 1:26:22.583
-It wasn't real.
-Grow up, Cassandra.

1:26:22.625 --> 1:26:25.916
You've had meat on the table
every day for weeks.
That's real.

1:26:25.958 --> 1:26:28.666
You've got silk stockings
and French perfume, too,

1:26:28.708 --> 1:26:30.750
should you decide you've got
the nerve to use them.

1:26:30.791 --> 1:26:35.708
Use them for what?
To trap a kind, good,

1:26:35.750 --> 1:26:39.666
sensitive man into marriage
and destroy him?

1:26:42.875 --> 1:26:44.583
Cassandra...

1:26:47.041 --> 1:26:50.083
you're in love with him.

1:26:50.125 --> 1:26:55.083
-Simon. My fiancé.

1:26:56.458 --> 1:26:59.875
Oh, that is all we need.

1:26:59.916 --> 1:27:02.083
Do you think
I wouldn't give him up?

1:27:02.125 --> 1:27:04.208
Do you think I wouldn't throw
the whole thing in his face

1:27:04.250 --> 1:27:05.875
if I thought
he'd have you instead?

1:27:05.916 --> 1:27:09.000
-I know you wouldn't.
-I know he wouldn't.

1:27:09.041 --> 1:27:12.291
He thinks
you're just a funny little girl.

1:27:14.125 --> 1:27:17.416
I am not greedy, Cassandra.
I am not selfish.

1:27:17.458 --> 1:27:19.958
I'm not just doing this
for myself.

1:27:20.000 --> 1:27:22.125
Don't go. You mustn't go.

1:27:22.166 --> 1:27:25.208
What will I tell everyone
in the morning
when you aren't here?

1:27:25.250 --> 1:27:27.416
You're already living a lie.

1:27:27.458 --> 1:27:29.833
Tell them what
the bloody hell you like

1:27:29.875 --> 1:27:31.208
and then go into your bathroom

1:27:31.250 --> 1:27:34.208
and count
your peach-colored towels.

1:27:46.000 --> 1:27:50.625
I have played
too many games with love,

1:27:50.666 --> 1:27:53.583
but I don't know
any of the rules.

1:27:59.666 --> 1:28:02.541
I wanted Rose
to marry into money.

1:28:02.583 --> 1:28:04.958
I willed her
to fall in love with Simon

1:28:05.000 --> 1:28:08.500
and then wanted it all undone
because I was jealous.

1:28:08.541 --> 1:28:14.541
I have betrayed her
and I hate myself,
because I love my sister.

1:28:14.583 --> 1:28:18.166
That'll be three and 11 plus
sixpence for admittance of dog.

1:28:18.208 --> 1:28:21.958
-They're banned. It's a fine.

1:28:28.125 --> 1:28:30.208
I've lost my purse.

1:28:30.250 --> 1:28:33.208
You should have
thought about that
before you ordered cutlets.

1:28:33.250 --> 1:28:37.083
I'll be waiting by the door,
and I want my pencil back.

1:28:39.791 --> 1:28:41.958
Will you let me help you?

1:28:46.333 --> 1:28:49.750
Could you just lend me
two pence for the telephone?

1:29:22.208 --> 1:29:23.833
Hello?

1:29:23.875 --> 1:29:25.458
Can I speak
to Stephen Colly, please?

1:29:25.500 --> 1:29:26.916
It's Cassandra.

1:29:26.958 --> 1:29:29.333
Do you know what time it is?

1:29:31.250 --> 1:29:33.541
I was offered that part
in the film.

1:29:34.958 --> 1:29:36.416
Will you take it?

1:29:37.916 --> 1:29:39.583
Haven't decided.

1:29:41.083 --> 1:29:42.958
Are you unhappy with me?

1:29:43.000 --> 1:29:45.750
I'm unhappy with myself...

1:29:45.791 --> 1:29:48.875
-and Rose.
-Rose is a bad girl.

1:29:51.500 --> 1:29:53.500
In what way?

1:29:53.541 --> 1:29:56.625
She's just a bad girl.
A lot of women are.

1:29:56.666 --> 1:29:59.583
Sometimes we're bad
without meaning to be.

1:30:01.125 --> 1:30:03.000
You're not a woman yet.

1:30:04.291 --> 1:30:06.583
Unlike Leda.

1:30:08.958 --> 1:30:13.583
She's been very good to me,
but I don't love her.

1:30:14.750 --> 1:30:16.458
I love you.

1:30:16.500 --> 1:30:18.166
I know.

1:30:19.583 --> 1:30:20.916
When we were in the woods,

1:30:20.958 --> 1:30:23.083
I wondered if you loved me, too.

1:30:24.583 --> 1:30:26.541
I'm really sorry.

1:30:29.125 --> 1:30:31.333
Is it Neil or Simon?

1:30:32.625 --> 1:30:34.666
Which one are you in love with?

1:30:35.833 --> 1:30:37.333
Simon...

1:30:38.791 --> 1:30:40.958
Cassandra...

1:30:41.000 --> 1:30:44.500
and it really, really hurts.

1:30:48.000 --> 1:30:50.250
Marry me.

1:30:50.291 --> 1:30:51.500
I can make it hurt less.

1:30:51.541 --> 1:30:53.291
I can earn good money now.

1:30:53.333 --> 1:30:58.541
I don't love you, Stephen.
I don't love you.

1:31:02.541 --> 1:31:06.000
It's like some
hideous party game.

1:31:06.041 --> 1:31:09.625
Everybody's dancing and nobody's
getting the prize they want,

1:31:09.666 --> 1:31:13.666
because it's all third-hand
and second-best.

1:31:14.625 --> 1:31:16.666
I can't bear it.

1:31:45.083 --> 1:31:46.666
Father?

1:32:20.291 --> 1:32:21.875
Seen enough?

1:32:27.916 --> 1:32:30.541
What is all this about, Father?

1:32:30.583 --> 1:32:33.125
Elizabeth believes that an
author must allow his material

1:32:33.166 --> 1:32:35.541
to marinate, to become seasoned,

1:32:35.583 --> 1:32:37.791
tempered, before it can be
worked with.

1:32:37.833 --> 1:32:40.583
Elizabeth Cotton doesn't believe
you'll ever write another word.

1:32:40.625 --> 1:32:42.875
No, you don't believe
I'll ever write another word.

1:32:42.916 --> 1:32:45.625
-I've been working very hard.
-You've hypnotized us all

1:32:45.666 --> 1:32:48.375
into turning a blind eye,
Father.

1:32:48.416 --> 1:32:52.250
We accepted everything you did.
We let you lock yourself away.

1:32:52.291 --> 1:32:54.958
For me, secrecy has always been
the essence of creation.

1:32:55.000 --> 1:32:59.250
And what have you created,
Father, in the last 12 years?

1:32:59.291 --> 1:33:03.500
What have you created
beyond poverty and despair?

1:33:03.541 --> 1:33:05.750
I am the head of this household.
I'm entitled to respect.

1:33:05.791 --> 1:33:10.208
You aren't respected.
You're indulged.

1:33:10.250 --> 1:33:14.000
Why don't you just
write something?

1:33:22.083 --> 1:33:24.375
I lost my temper.
I'm not myself.

1:33:24.416 --> 1:33:28.541
This is yourself.
This is why you went to prison.

1:33:28.583 --> 1:33:30.416
This is what
you did to mother.

1:33:30.458 --> 1:33:31.958
No, Cassandra, it is not.

1:33:32.000 --> 1:33:33.666
Do you think we can't remember

1:33:33.708 --> 1:33:35.333
because we never talk about it?

1:33:35.375 --> 1:33:36.958
I'm not going
to discuss it with you!

1:33:37.000 --> 1:33:40.125
Oh...

1:33:40.166 --> 1:33:43.875
-We need Topaz.
-You've driven her away.

1:33:43.916 --> 1:33:47.500
You've driven everyone away.

1:33:48.791 --> 1:33:50.708
Except you.

1:33:53.500 --> 1:33:56.000
I'm staying here.

1:33:56.041 --> 1:34:00.000
I'm going to sit
in this chair and watch you

1:34:00.041 --> 1:34:04.833
and wait until you've
written something down.

1:34:08.916 --> 1:34:11.166
Your mother used to do that.

1:34:36.250 --> 1:34:39.000
Oh, Father.

1:34:39.041 --> 1:34:42.375
This is worse than prison
and it might go on forever.

1:34:49.041 --> 1:34:50.541
Room service.

1:34:50.583 --> 1:34:52.250
Come in.

1:35:03.958 --> 1:35:08.291
I have to talk to you,
Mr. Cotton, before it's
too late.

1:35:20.916 --> 1:35:23.791
Writing somewhere new
can be inspiring.

1:35:32.541 --> 1:35:34.166
Come on.

1:35:39.708 --> 1:35:41.250
Where are you going?

1:35:41.291 --> 1:35:43.125
I think this might unlock you.

1:35:43.166 --> 1:35:45.041
Supplies.

1:35:45.083 --> 1:35:46.875
What?

1:35:46.916 --> 1:35:49.125
We'll let you out
when you've finished 50 pages.

1:35:49.166 --> 1:35:54.250
Fifty pages?
It took me a year to write
50 pages of "Jacob Wrestling."

1:35:54.291 --> 1:35:56.583
It's really good
you're feeling so angry.

1:35:56.625 --> 1:35:58.250
Harness the rage.

1:35:58.291 --> 1:36:00.583
Just write,
"The cat sat on the mat."

1:36:00.625 --> 1:36:02.250
It'll be a start.

1:36:02.291 --> 1:36:04.541
What the bloody hell
do you think you're doing?

1:36:04.583 --> 1:36:07.875
Don't you dare leave me here,
you bastard brats!

1:36:07.916 --> 1:36:11.333
Come back here!
Come back here, I tell you!

1:36:12.458 --> 1:36:14.083
Come back here!

1:36:25.500 --> 1:36:27.958
Listen to him.
Can you hear him?

1:36:28.000 --> 1:36:29.458
Yes.

1:36:34.041 --> 1:36:36.583
I have done a terrible thing.

1:36:36.625 --> 1:36:39.250
I have put my father
back in prison.

1:36:39.291 --> 1:36:41.708
It may be the end of him.

1:36:49.250 --> 1:36:50.791
Is Rose here?

1:36:50.833 --> 1:36:52.125
No.

1:36:53.250 --> 1:36:54.666
She's run away.

1:36:55.750 --> 1:36:58.041
Do you know
where she might of gone?

1:37:08.708 --> 1:37:14.083
"I love you. Stop.
Don't hate me. Stop. Rose."

1:37:18.250 --> 1:37:20.208
It's from Walberswick.

1:37:21.291 --> 1:37:22.583
Let's go.

1:37:27.166 --> 1:37:31.041
We had a fight
the night I was in London.

1:37:31.083 --> 1:37:33.333
I said some terrible
things to her.

1:37:33.375 --> 1:37:36.250
Not everything in the world
is your fault, Cassandra.

1:37:36.291 --> 1:37:39.541
Not everything in the world
is your responsibility.

1:37:44.708 --> 1:37:47.833
I would have liked for you
to have seen a proper sunrise.

1:37:48.916 --> 1:37:53.083
This is a crisis, Simon,
not a treat.

1:37:53.125 --> 1:37:57.000
It's where we had the barbecue,
the day when Neil said,

1:37:57.041 --> 1:38:00.666
"Have you ever seen
such a change in a girl?"

1:38:00.708 --> 1:38:04.666
She was being herself.
That was the only difference.

1:38:04.708 --> 1:38:07.416
She was happy here.

1:38:07.458 --> 1:38:09.500
That's what brought her back.

1:38:13.083 --> 1:38:15.166
There's a light on
at the inn now.

1:38:33.500 --> 1:38:35.666
Neil's here, too.

1:38:35.708 --> 1:38:38.666
They haven't had time
to get married.

1:38:41.416 --> 1:38:43.625
They hate each other.

1:38:45.333 --> 1:38:49.333
♪ The very thought of you
and I forget to do ♪

1:38:49.375 --> 1:38:54.000
♪ The little ordinary things ♪

1:39:01.375 --> 1:39:03.666

1:39:06.416 --> 1:39:09.666
And I knew then
that this was love,

1:39:11.041 --> 1:39:14.416
because my heart
was breaking for him.

1:39:33.791 --> 1:39:35.375
The rest will come.

1:39:35.416 --> 1:39:37.041
What if it never does?

1:39:38.166 --> 1:39:40.000
I don't know.

1:39:44.333 --> 1:39:46.125
I don't know.

1:39:47.541 --> 1:39:49.333
You look so tired.

1:39:49.375 --> 1:39:51.166
Do I?

1:39:51.208 --> 1:39:53.541
Do you think
I don't notice things?

1:39:53.583 --> 1:39:55.875
You never say.

1:39:55.916 --> 1:39:59.916
I'm not as articulate
as I pretend.

1:39:59.958 --> 1:40:02.875
For a while, the whole world
thought otherwise,

1:40:02.916 --> 1:40:06.458
and I was ashamed to be so mute
in things that mattered,

1:40:06.500 --> 1:40:09.166
-and to be called a genius.
-You are a genius.

1:40:09.208 --> 1:40:13.166
I'm an ordinary man
and I'm not invincible.

1:40:13.208 --> 1:40:16.583
-You haven't failed.
-I failed your mother.

1:40:19.083 --> 1:40:22.083
I knew she was ill, Cassandra.

1:40:22.125 --> 1:40:25.666
I knew when I went for her
with the cake knife,
and so did she.

1:40:25.708 --> 1:40:28.083
Don't tell me.

1:40:28.125 --> 1:40:30.333
She had said...

1:40:31.958 --> 1:40:34.666
She had said I didn't care.

1:40:36.875 --> 1:40:41.000
She accused me
of lacking tenderness...

1:40:42.625 --> 1:40:44.541
and she was right.

1:40:45.583 --> 1:40:48.708
I couldn't make her secure.

1:40:48.750 --> 1:40:52.541
I couldn't
make her feel loved,

1:40:53.666 --> 1:40:55.875
even when she was dying!

1:41:08.916 --> 1:41:12.291
Don't cry. Don't cry.

1:41:12.333 --> 1:41:14.666
What good are words on a page?

1:41:14.708 --> 1:41:20.625
What good is anything
if a man can't open his heart
and let himself out?

1:41:25.500 --> 1:41:27.750
I would give every word
I ever wrote

1:41:27.791 --> 1:41:30.125
to have this moment with her.

1:41:30.166 --> 1:41:32.958
She would like that.

1:41:33.000 --> 1:41:35.458
Would she forgive me?

1:41:35.500 --> 1:41:38.458
She would say she understood.

1:41:49.166 --> 1:41:51.375
Have I failed you, Cassandra?

1:41:52.791 --> 1:41:55.041
-I'm 18.

1:41:59.666 --> 1:42:01.916
I can't see it, somehow.

1:42:20.833 --> 1:42:22.958
I don't expect you
to forgive me.

1:42:23.000 --> 1:42:24.666
I know that.

1:42:26.541 --> 1:42:29.791
I thought I was going
to lose you, again.

1:42:29.833 --> 1:42:32.041
I wouldn't let that happen.

1:42:33.541 --> 1:42:35.583
It's good we can be civilized.

1:42:35.625 --> 1:42:38.958
Yes,
mother's pleased about that.

1:42:42.791 --> 1:42:44.791
You see,
I saw Neil kissing her

1:42:44.833 --> 1:42:46.458
the night he lied
about the bear.

1:42:46.500 --> 1:42:48.500
I saw Rose
kiss him back, too.

1:42:48.541 --> 1:42:51.291
Was that before
she slapped his face or after?

1:42:51.333 --> 1:42:54.291
She never slapped his face.
I went to his hotel,

1:42:54.333 --> 1:42:57.000
because I believed
things would come right

1:42:57.041 --> 1:43:00.166
if just one person
told the truth.

1:43:00.208 --> 1:43:03.416
Rose has never been
so happy in her life.

1:43:03.458 --> 1:43:05.833
I didn't do it for Rose.

1:43:05.875 --> 1:43:10.583
I did it for you,
so you could have Simon.

1:43:10.625 --> 1:43:13.083
[wedding processional
playing on organ]

1:43:33.166 --> 1:43:35.583
Can we get a move on, please?

1:43:35.625 --> 1:43:38.208
This way everyone. Come along.

1:43:39.333 --> 1:43:41.250
See you in the cab.

1:43:51.875 --> 1:43:54.041
I'm scared, Cassie.

1:43:54.083 --> 1:43:56.000
You're in love.

1:43:56.041 --> 1:43:58.791
You know I'm telling
the truth this time, don't you?

1:43:58.833 --> 1:44:01.458
I know.

1:44:01.500 --> 1:44:04.666
I want you to be this happy,
Cassandra.

1:44:04.708 --> 1:44:08.000
I want you to know
what this feels like.

1:44:13.250 --> 1:44:15.041
I know I'm supposed
to throw it and everything,

1:44:15.083 --> 1:44:16.541
but it's only got
a bit of ribbon around it

1:44:16.583 --> 1:44:18.625
and I'm afraid
it might fall apart,

1:44:18.666 --> 1:44:22.291
or you'll miss
and Mrs. Cotton will catch it.

1:44:42.000 --> 1:44:45.625
And so my sister departed
for the New World.

1:44:54.416 --> 1:44:56.000
Just knock.

1:45:05.416 --> 1:45:07.375
Read this.

1:45:14.791 --> 1:45:17.291
You don't need me.

1:45:17.333 --> 1:45:19.166
I do.

1:45:20.833 --> 1:45:22.750
Come home.

1:45:26.375 --> 1:45:29.958
And now our lives
seem full of possibility.

1:45:30.000 --> 1:45:32.458
Work on the novel continues.

1:45:32.500 --> 1:45:35.958
Passages are being published
in a highbrow magazine.

1:45:36.000 --> 1:45:41.583
Topaz, get yourself up here,
woman! Now!

1:45:41.625 --> 1:45:45.416
"The cat sat on the mat"
was not a nonsense.

1:45:45.458 --> 1:45:48.083
It concerns a child
who is learning to read

1:45:48.125 --> 1:45:52.083
and is symbolic of a journey
towards understanding.

1:45:54.458 --> 1:46:00.208
The key to all knowledge comes
in words of just one syllable...
apparently.

1:46:00.250 --> 1:46:04.416
Hello

1:46:04.458 --> 1:46:08.375
I'm planning a critical essay
on your father's new work after
the excerpts are published.

1:46:08.416 --> 1:46:11.041
The whole novel could
take its time in coming,
you see?

1:46:11.083 --> 1:46:12.500
Things have to be kept alive.

1:46:12.541 --> 1:46:15.333
I suppose you mean
Father's reputation?

1:46:15.375 --> 1:46:17.541
I mean everything
I've come to love here.

1:46:17.583 --> 1:46:21.041
England matters too much.
I'll never give it up.

1:46:21.083 --> 1:46:23.500
Even if you go back to America?

1:46:24.750 --> 1:46:26.333
Even when.

1:46:29.958 --> 1:46:32.250
I wish I could take you with me.

1:46:34.583 --> 1:46:36.583
Would you come?

1:46:37.583 --> 1:46:39.333
Would you?

1:46:40.750 --> 1:46:43.916
Not if you're still
in love with Rose.

1:46:50.291 --> 1:46:53.750
How can you be, Simon,
after everything she did?

1:46:53.791 --> 1:46:55.916
Because I don't have a choice.

1:46:55.958 --> 1:46:57.416
Love is like that.

1:46:57.458 --> 1:47:00.041
Do you think I don't know
love is like that?

1:47:01.666 --> 1:47:03.333
I'm sorry.

1:47:05.875 --> 1:47:09.250
We could be good companions,
Cassandra.

1:47:09.291 --> 1:47:11.625
We could read poetry together.

1:47:11.666 --> 1:47:15.416
I could play you music.
You'd make me laugh.

1:47:16.666 --> 1:47:19.208
Wouldn't that be
a nice little life?

1:47:19.250 --> 1:47:22.166
-It wouldn't be enough.
-I don't ask for ecstasy.

1:47:22.208 --> 1:47:25.000
I mean enough for me.

1:47:27.250 --> 1:47:30.500
Simon, I don't want
to go through life

1:47:30.541 --> 1:47:35.625
like my mother, afraid that
I'm not really loved.

1:47:35.666 --> 1:47:40.208
Even if it meant I could
go through life with you.

1:47:42.000 --> 1:47:44.083
I can understand that.

1:47:46.250 --> 1:47:50.750
You know,
I'd love to see America one day,

1:47:52.041 --> 1:47:55.541
should circumstances
ever prove favorable.

1:48:03.625 --> 1:48:05.666
I will come back.

1:48:05.708 --> 1:48:08.916
They're just not favorable now.

1:48:11.833 --> 1:48:14.833
You were always wise
beyond your years.

1:48:16.083 --> 1:48:18.250
No, I wasn't.

1:48:21.250 --> 1:48:24.333
I used to be consciously naive.

1:48:32.125 --> 1:48:33.791
Perhaps he meant it.

1:48:33.833 --> 1:48:36.541
Perhaps he will come back,

1:48:36.583 --> 1:48:42.125
but everything feels fractured
and my heart is bruised.

1:48:42.166 --> 1:48:47.750
Still, better all that hurt
than to have known no pain...

1:48:47.791 --> 1:48:49.458
learnt nothing.

1:49:11.041 --> 1:49:13.500
There's only the last page
left to write on.

1:49:14.625 --> 1:49:18.000
I'll fill it with words
of just one syllable.

1:49:19.125 --> 1:49:20.291
I love.

1:49:21.916 --> 1:49:23.666
I have loved.

1:49:27.375 --> 1:49:29.208
I will love.
