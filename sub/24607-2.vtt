HAVE YOU MADE UP
YOUR MIND?

CHANGED MY MIND,
YOU MEAN? NO.

02:11.566 --> 02:13.829

GETTING RESTLESS.

02:13.872 --> 02:15.570

DOES OSLEYA IMPOSE?

FOR YOU, DIDN'T I?

SOMETHING WRONG.

04:55.469 --> 04:58.123

-MOVE OVER.

ALREADY KNOW.

HERE?

KARA RUNS THE

06:27.778 --> 06:29.127
JUST LIKE SHE DID
ON THE ARK.

WHAT SHE HAS TO SAY.

THE BLUEPRINTS. GO AHEAD.

06:32.957 --> 06:34.524

THE BLUEPRINTS.

06:34.568 --> 06:36.004
I STUDIED THEM
WELL ENOUGH

06:36.047 --> 06:38.572
BEFORE TAKING THIS BUNKER
FOR OUR PEOPLE.

06:38.615 --> 06:41.096
YOU WANT TO KNOW IF
THERE'S ANOTHER WAY OUT.

06:41.139 --> 06:44.142
THERE ISN'T.

06:48.756 --> 06:50.410
KANE: WELL, THIS
CHANGES NOTHING.

06:50.453 --> 06:52.716
WE CAN'T SURVIVE OUTSIDE FOR
THE NEXT 5 YEARS, ANYWAY.

06:52.760 --> 06:55.850
THAT MEANS WE HAVE 5 YEARS
TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM.

06:55.893 --> 06:57.373
WHAT WOULD IT TAKE
TO CUT AROUND THE HATCH

06:57.417 --> 06:58.461
OR BREAK THROUGH
AN OUTER WALL?

06:58.505 --> 06:59.723
YOU POINT ME
TO A WEAK SPOT,

06:59.767 --> 07:00.811
I'LL GET YOU A TEAM
THAT CAN BREAK THROUGH.

07:00.855 --> 07:02.334
JAHA: YOU'RE NOT LISTENING.

07:02.378 --> 07:04.249
EVEN IF WE COULD CUT AROUND
THE HATCH, WHICH WE CAN'T,

07:04.293 --> 07:06.904
I'M GUESSING THAT THE TOWER
COLLAPSED ABOVE US,

07:06.948 --> 07:09.516
WHICH MEANS THOUSANDS
OF TONS OF RUBBLE.

07:09.559 --> 07:12.693
AS FAR AS THE OUTER WALL,
THAT'S 12 INCHES OF SOLID STEEL

07:12.736 --> 07:14.651
SURROUNDED BY BEDROCK.

07:14.695 --> 07:16.261
THERE ARE NO
VULNERABILITIES,

07:16.305 --> 07:19.047
AND WE DON'T HAVE THE EQUIPMENT
TO EXPLOIT THEM IF THERE WERE,

07:19.090 --> 07:21.963
NOT IN 5 YEARS,
NOT IN A HUNDRED.

07:22.006 --> 07:23.834
KARA: THERE'S A MORE
PRESSING ISSUE.

07:23.878 --> 07:25.706

WON'T SUPPORT US

07:25.749 --> 07:27.751
BEYOND THOSE 5 YEARS.

07:27.795 --> 07:29.710
EVEN IF WE REPLACE
THE MEDICINAL FIELDS

07:29.753 --> 07:31.320
WITH FOOD PRODUCERS
AND ROTATE THEM

07:31.363 --> 07:32.800
FOR NUTRIENT DIVERSITY,

07:32.843 --> 07:34.802
WILL EVENTUALLY LEAD
TO A MASS DIE-OFF.

FOR THE PLANTS
AND FOR US.

07:36.586 --> 07:38.762

HEARING OF THIS NOW?

07:38.806 --> 07:41.199
BEFORE NOW,
I COULD MANAGE IT.

07:41.243 --> 07:43.114
WHEN SHE ALLOWED 1,200
PEOPLE INTO THIS BUNKER,

07:43.158 --> 07:44.768
IT WAS BASED ON
5-YEAR CALCULATIONS.

07:44.812 --> 07:46.335
YOU'RE BLAMING ME
FOR THIS?

07:46.378 --> 07:47.771
YOU FORCED
YOUR OWN PEOPLE

07:47.815 --> 07:49.556
OUT INTO THAT FIRE,
AND FOR WHAT?

07:49.599 --> 07:50.687
GET HER OUT OF HERE.

07:50.731 --> 07:52.080
THIS BUNKER WASN'T
YOURS TO GIVE.

07:52.123 --> 07:53.037
JAHA: COOPER--

07:53.081 --> 07:54.343
JAHA FOUND IT.
IT BELONGED TO US.

07:54.386 --> 07:55.866
YOU HAD NO RIGHT.

07:55.910 --> 07:58.739
KANE:
THAT'S ENOUGH.

08:06.921 --> 08:08.313
WHAT THE HELL
IS HER PROBLEM?

08:08.357 --> 08:10.533
ABBY: KARA'S FATHER DIED
IN THE CULLING ON THE ARK,

08:10.577 --> 08:14.537
AND HER HUSBAND, WELL, HE DIDN'T
MAKE THE CUT FOR THE BUNKER.

08:14.581 --> 08:16.060
JAHA: SHE'S
DONE THE MATH.

08:16.104 --> 08:17.801
SHE KNOWS WE'LL
HAVE TO CONSIDER

08:17.845 --> 08:20.630
POPULATION REDUCTION
YET AGAIN.

08:20.674 --> 08:23.807
NOT A CHANCE.

08:23.851 --> 08:26.375
IF WE NEED
AN ENGINEER AGAIN,

08:26.418 --> 08:28.203
WE WILL LET YOU KNOW.

08:47.265 --> 08:50.791
WE SHOULD INCREASE THE GUARD
PRESENCE ON EVERY FLOOR.

08:50.834 --> 08:53.010
I SUGGEST ASSIGNING THEM
TO THEIR OWN CLANS.

08:53.054 --> 08:54.708
I'LL SEGREGATE
MEAL TIMES

08:54.751 --> 08:55.839
AND CONVENE
THE DELEGATES.

08:55.883 --> 08:57.232
ABBY: LET'S JUST GET
BACK TO THE FACT

08:57.275 --> 08:58.581
THAT THERE ARE TOO MANY
PEOPLE IN THIS BUNKER.

08:58.625 --> 09:02.193
-LET'S NOT.
-I AGREE.

09:02.237 --> 09:04.108
IT'S NOT A DECISION
FOR TODAY,

09:04.152 --> 09:06.328
BUT, AS MUCH AS
I HATE TO SAY IT,

09:06.371 --> 09:07.590
JAHA'S RIGHT.

09:07.634 --> 09:08.983
IS NOT IN CHARGE HERE.

09:09.026 --> 09:11.072
NEITHER ARE YOU
OR THE DELEGATES.

09:11.115 --> 09:13.030
I AM, AND I DIDN'T
SAVE US ALL

09:13.074 --> 09:14.684
SO WE COULD JUST
KILL OURSELVES.

09:14.728 --> 09:15.946
OCTAVIA, THIS
ISN'T A GAME.

09:15.990 --> 09:17.208
INDRA: OSLEYA
HAS DECIDED.

09:17.252 --> 09:18.688
KANE: NO OFFENSE,
BUT YOUR CHAMPION

09:18.732 --> 09:20.385
HASN'T BEEN VERY
INTERESTED IN LEADING.

09:20.429 --> 09:22.605
SHE'S INTERESTED NOW.

09:22.649 --> 09:24.564
WHAT HAPPENS IF WE
GO TO HALF RATIONS?

09:24.607 --> 09:26.043
DOES THAT
BUY US MORE TIME?

09:26.087 --> 09:27.958
ABBY: THEORETICALLY, YES,
BUT WE'RE ALREADY AT BASELINE.

09:28.002 --> 09:30.134
IT WON'T BE LONG BEFORE
WE START SEEING CASES

09:30.178 --> 09:32.572
OF ADAPTIVE
THERMOGENESIS,

09:32.615 --> 09:34.574
STARVATION RESPONSE.

09:34.617 --> 09:36.488
WILL WE
SURVIVE OR NOT?

09:36.532 --> 09:39.709
ABBY: WE'LL SURVIVE.
WE'LL JUST WISH WE DIDN'T.

09:39.753 --> 09:43.452
SOME OF US
ALREADY DO.

09:45.062 --> 09:47.543
THEN WE GO
TO HALF RATIONS.

10:07.476 --> 10:08.912
MIND IF I JOIN YOU?

10:08.956 --> 10:10.914
MM. YEAH. MM-HMM.

10:14.265 --> 10:16.616
MAN: I DON'T WHAT
THEY'RE PLANNING,

10:16.659 --> 10:18.792
IF IT'S GONNA WORK.

10:20.271 --> 10:26.930
TODAY'S BEEN
DIFFICULT ON US ALL.

10:26.974 --> 10:28.628
WE DON'T EVEN KNOW
IF IT WAS CLARKE.

10:28.671 --> 10:30.542
WHAT MATTERS IS NOT
WHAT WE KNOW,

10:30.586 --> 10:31.805
BUT WHAT WE BELIEVE.

10:31.848 --> 10:33.763
YOUR ENGINEERING MENTOR
WOULD DISAGREE.

10:33.807 --> 10:37.071
HA HA! AND MY POLITICAL
MENTOR WOULDN'T,

10:37.114 --> 10:39.595
BUT WHATEVER YOU'RE
FIGHTING ABOUT,

10:39.639 --> 10:41.641
SHE'LL COME AROUND.

SECONDS, PLEASE?

10:48.735 --> 10:50.650
HERE, ETHAN.
YOU CAN TAKE MINE.

10:50.693 --> 10:53.609
UM, NO. THANK YOU.

10:55.872 --> 10:59.049
LOOK. UNCLE MARCUS
NEEDS TO EAT, TOO, HMM,

10:59.093 --> 11:00.877
AND YOU NEED TO GET USED
TO HALF RATIONS

11:00.921 --> 11:03.445
JUST LIKE THE REST
OF US, OK?

11:03.488 --> 11:05.229
GOOD. NOW COME ON.

11:05.273 --> 11:07.841
I GOT A SURPRISE FOR YOU
IN THE ROOM.

11:12.019 --> 11:15.979
AND I'M STILL GLAD
YOU TALKED ME OUT

11:16.023 --> 11:19.200
OF FIGHTING OCTAVIA
FOR THIS PLACE.

11:21.202 --> 11:24.074
CHANCELLOR JAHA, SIR,
WOULD YOU MIND STAYING?

11:24.118 --> 11:25.989
I HAVE AN IDEA FOR
MAKING THE FOOD LAST.

11:26.033 --> 11:27.556
I JUST NEED A FEW
MINUTES TO EXPLAIN.

11:27.599 --> 11:28.992
IN THE MORNING,
KARA.

11:29.036 --> 11:30.167
IF IT'S STILL
A GOOD IDEA,

11:30.211 --> 11:31.995
WE CAN TALK
ABOUT IT THEN.

11:32.039 --> 11:34.084
MAN: NOT KNOWING WE CAN GET OUT
CHANGES EVERYTHING.

11:34.128 --> 11:36.478
JACKSON: AT LEAST ON THE ARK,
WE HAD WINDOWS.

11:36.521 --> 11:40.134
MILLER: THE ARK SUCKED,
BUT WE SURVIVED IT,

11:40.177 --> 11:43.180
AND IF WE GOT EACH OTHER,
WE'LL SURVIVE THIS, TOO.

11:43.224 --> 11:44.529
SEE YOU AFTER
MY SHIFT?

11:44.573 --> 11:46.357
-YEAH.
-OK.

11:49.230 --> 11:53.495
I'M REALLY HAPPY
FOR YOU, JACKSON.

11:54.583 --> 11:57.151
LET'S TALK ABOUT YOU.

11:57.194 --> 11:58.848
MARCUS SAID YOU
HAD ANOTHER HEADACHE.

11:58.892 --> 11:59.936
I THOUGHT THEY WERE
SUPPOSED TO STOP

11:59.980 --> 12:01.111
AFTER THE ICE BATH.

12:01.155 --> 12:03.113
THEY WILL, BUT
IN THE MEANTIME,

12:03.157 --> 12:04.419
I WOULD REALLY
APPRECIATE IT

12:04.462 --> 12:06.726
IF YOU DIDN'T DISCUSS MY
CONDITION WITH MARCUS.

12:06.769 --> 12:08.292
HE CARES
ABOUT YOU, ABBY.

12:08.336 --> 12:10.642
WE BOTH DO,
AND I'M JUST--

12:10.686 --> 12:12.601
UH! UGH...

12:15.038 --> 12:16.866
JACKSON: SHE'S
HAVING A SEIZURE.

12:16.910 --> 12:19.347
-FLIP HER ON HER SIDE.
-YEP.

12:19.390 --> 12:21.479
-UH!
-UGH!

12:25.092 --> 12:27.224
MAN: LET US IN!

12:27.268 --> 12:28.878
JACKSON:
WHAT IS THIS?

12:28.922 --> 12:30.445
EVERYBODY STAY CALM.

12:30.488 --> 12:32.447
WE'RE SAFE HERE.
THEY CAN'T GET TO US.

12:32.490 --> 12:34.231
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

12:34.275 --> 12:35.624
UH!

12:36.930 --> 12:38.670
WE'RE TAKING BACK
WHAT'S OURS.

12:43.763 --> 12:44.720
ABBY: MARCUS,
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

12:44.764 --> 12:46.113
OH...

12:47.723 --> 12:50.378
OHH...

12:52.728 --> 12:54.643
WHAT ARE WE
GONNA DO?

12:54.686 --> 12:56.601
WE'RE GONNA LIVE,

12:56.645 --> 12:58.560
AND ALTHOUGH
IT MAY BE UNFAIR,

12:58.603 --> 13:01.693
THEY'RE NOT.

13:03.478 --> 13:05.872
WHY ARE WE RESTRAINED?

13:05.915 --> 13:08.875
BECAUSE I DON'T KILL
MY OWN PEOPLE,

13:08.918 --> 13:11.660
EVEN THE ONES RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE DEATHS OF MY FATHER

13:11.703 --> 13:14.576
AND HUSBAND.

13:14.619 --> 13:16.447
ABBY HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH THAT.

13:16.491 --> 13:19.146
ABBY OPENED THE DOOR.

13:21.844 --> 13:23.628
I WONDER, WOULD YOU
HAVE DONE THAT

13:23.672 --> 13:26.196
IF HE WAS ALREADY
SAFE INSIDE?

13:28.329 --> 13:29.939
OH, KARA, PLEASE.

13:29.983 --> 13:32.376
THIS WON'T BRING YOUR HUSBAND
OR YOUR FATHER BACK.

13:32.420 --> 13:33.856
NO. IT WON'T,
BUT IT WILL STOP

13:33.900 --> 13:36.467
THE NEXT CULLING
OF OUR PEOPLE.

13:36.511 --> 13:37.817
NOW, IF YOU'LL
EXCUSE ME,

13:37.860 --> 13:38.818
I HAVE THE URGE TO SHOOT
YOU IN THE HEAD,

13:38.861 --> 13:41.603
AND I DON'T WANT
TO DO THAT.

13:41.646 --> 13:43.344
WHAT ABOUT OUR PEOPLE
WHO ARE ON

13:43.387 --> 13:45.825
THE WRONG SIDE
OF THIS DOOR?

13:45.868 --> 13:48.479
THEY'RE NOT ALL
HERE, ARE THEY?

13:48.523 --> 13:50.133
WE WAITED AS LONG AS
WE COULD TO STRIKE.

13:50.177 --> 13:51.569
ALL WE CAN DO NOW IS
MAKE SURE THE ONES

13:51.613 --> 13:53.833
THAT WE COULDN'T SAVE
DON'T DIE IN VAIN.

13:53.876 --> 13:57.184
IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN QUICK.
YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?

13:58.011 --> 14:00.056
STARVATION
IS SLOW, KARA.

14:00.100 --> 14:03.320
THOSE PEOPLE OUT THERE,
OURS AND THEIRS,

14:03.364 --> 14:04.974
THEIR BODIES WILL
METABOLIZE

14:05.018 --> 14:07.498
NONESSENTIAL
PROTEINS FIRST--

14:07.542 --> 14:10.850
FATTY ACIDS,
GLYCEROL, THEN MUSCLE.

14:10.893 --> 14:12.503
THEY'LL LOSE
THEIR HAIR.

14:12.547 --> 14:13.896
THEIR SKIN
WILL FLAKE AND PEEL.

14:13.940 --> 14:17.508
THEY'LL BLOAT,
AND THE FIRST TO DIE,

14:17.552 --> 14:20.033
WELL, THEY'RE GONNA
BE THE LUCKY ONES.

14:20.076 --> 14:22.339
THEY WON'T HAVE
TO FIGHT THE TEMPTATION

14:22.383 --> 14:25.168
TO EAT THEIR FRIENDS.

14:25.212 --> 14:27.823
YOU'RE THIRD-GENERATION
FARM STATION.

14:27.867 --> 14:30.652
YOU MUST HAVE HEARD THE
RUMORS ABOUT THE BLIGHT.

14:30.695 --> 14:33.698
IT'S WHY WE STARTED
FLOATING OUR DEAD.

14:33.742 --> 14:35.918
EVERYTHING YOU JUST
DESCRIBED WOULD HAVE

14:35.962 --> 14:38.834
HAPPENED TO US
IN 5 YEARS.

14:38.878 --> 14:42.751
YOU SHOULD NEVER HAVE
OPENED THAT DOOR.

14:42.794 --> 14:45.710
THESE DEATHS
ARE ON YOU, TOO.

14:48.061 --> 14:50.759
JAHA: "WELL," SAID THE TREE,
STRAIGHTENING HERSELF UP

14:50.802 --> 14:52.979
AS MUCH AS SHE COULD,

14:53.022 --> 14:56.939
"AN OLD STUMP IS GOOD
FOR SITTING AND RESTING.

14:56.983 --> 14:59.986
"COME, BOY. SIT DOWN.

15:00.029 --> 15:03.990
SIT AND REST,"
AND THE BOY DID,

15:04.033 --> 15:07.080
AND THE TREE WAS HAPPY.

15:12.476 --> 15:16.567
NIYLAH: HE'S BEEN ASLEEP
SINCE THE BOY BUILT THE BOAT.

15:16.611 --> 15:19.048
I LIKE THAT STORY.

15:19.092 --> 15:21.311
ME, TOO.

15:22.878 --> 15:25.446
IT WAS MY SON'S
FAVORITE.

15:27.796 --> 15:30.364
I HATE
TO BOTHER YOU.

15:30.407 --> 15:32.583
GOT TIME TO FIX
MY WHEEL?

15:32.627 --> 15:35.717
UM, LET ME
TAKE A LOOK.

15:48.948 --> 15:51.428
MAN: SKAIKRU,
ON YOUR FEET!

15:51.472 --> 15:52.952
HEY, YOU!

15:55.215 --> 15:57.608
UNDER THE BED
WITH NIYLAH. HURRY.

15:57.652 --> 16:00.655
MAN: MOVE!
RIGHT NOW!

16:00.698 --> 16:01.830
AAH!

16:03.919 --> 16:06.878
HEY, HEY, HEY,
WHAT'S THIS?

16:13.842 --> 16:16.410
UH! UH...

16:16.453 --> 16:18.934
UH! UH! UH!

16:23.852 --> 16:26.072
OCTAVIA:
STAND DOWN NOW.

16:26.115 --> 16:27.856
MILLER: WE SECURED
THE HALLWAY.

16:27.899 --> 16:29.292
EVERYONE'S ALIVE.

16:29.336 --> 16:30.554
WHAT'S GOING ON?

16:30.598 --> 16:32.034
THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT
TAKING BACK THE FARM.

16:32.078 --> 16:35.255
INDRA: YES. SKAIKRU SEALED
THE DOOR AND OUR FATE.

16:35.298 --> 16:37.344
STILL...

16:39.259 --> 16:40.390
NO.

16:40.434 --> 16:42.218
INDRA: THIS IS NOT
LIKE STEALING BLANKETS.

16:42.262 --> 16:45.352
THEY'RE SCARED,
INDRA, HUNGRY.

16:56.058 --> 16:59.279
SAFE TO SAY
SKAIKRU'S SCREWED.

16:59.322 --> 17:01.716
OUR OTHER BUNK ROOMS WILL BE
THE FIRST PLACE THEY LOOK.

17:01.759 --> 17:02.804
OCTAVIA:
GO ROOM TO ROOM.

17:02.847 --> 17:03.848
TAKE EVERYONE
YOU CAN FIND

17:03.892 --> 17:04.849
AND BRING THEM
TO THE ROTUNDA.

17:04.893 --> 17:06.503
WE CAN PROTECT
THEM THERE.

17:06.547 --> 17:10.203
-YEAH.
-NOT YOU.

17:18.515 --> 17:20.387
OK.

17:20.430 --> 17:23.303
LOOK. I NEED YOU TO GO
WITH NATHAN, ALL RIGHT,

17:23.346 --> 17:25.522
AND I'LL SEE YOU
AS SOON AS I--

17:25.566 --> 17:27.524
NO.

17:27.568 --> 17:31.267
I WANT TO STAY
WITH YOU.

17:35.097 --> 17:38.231
LOOK, LOOK.
COME HERE.

17:41.060 --> 17:42.452
YOU'LL BE OK.

17:43.627 --> 17:46.239
YOU SHOULD GO WITH THEM.
YOU'LL BE SAFER.

17:46.282 --> 17:49.546
SAFETY'S OVERRATED.
I'M WITH YOU.

17:49.590 --> 17:52.027
MILLER:
LET'S GO.

17:56.249 --> 17:57.728
BLUEPRINTS.

17:57.772 --> 18:00.035
JAHA: I'M GUESSING
YOU NEED ME TO OPEN

18:00.079 --> 18:02.385
ANOTHER
UNOPENABLE DOOR.

18:02.429 --> 18:07.216
OCTAVIA:
IF YOU CAN'T, WE'RE ALL DEAD.

18:15.311 --> 18:17.400
INDRA: NO ONE ELSE
COMES THROUGH THIS DOOR.

18:17.444 --> 18:18.923
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

18:18.967 --> 18:20.795
MAN: SHA, WORMANA.

18:21.752 --> 18:23.363
-IT'S NOT GOOD.

18:23.406 --> 18:25.104
THE REST OF SKAIKRU
IS SAFE FOR NOW,

18:25.147 --> 18:27.149
BUT THE VIOLENCE
IS SPREADING.

18:27.193 --> 18:29.760
BOUDALAN NOW CONTROLS
LEVEL E AND F.

18:29.804 --> 18:31.414
OUSKEJON TOOK MEDICAL.

18:31.458 --> 18:33.503
THE WEAK ARE HOLED UP,
BARRING THEIR DOORS,

18:33.547 --> 18:36.027
BUT IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME
BEFORE THE STRONG ATTACK,

18:36.071 --> 18:38.421
LOOKING FOR ANYTHING
TO HELP THEM SURVIVE.

18:38.465 --> 18:40.249
NIYLAH: WHEN HELL BREAKS LOOSE,
IT BREAKS LOOSE FAST.

18:40.293 --> 18:42.425
GAIA: IT ISN'T HELL.
IT'S WHO WE ARE.

18:42.469 --> 18:44.601
OCTAVIA: YOU'RE WRONG,
GAIA. WE ARE WONKRU.

18:44.645 --> 18:47.343
WORDS SPOKEN EASILY BY THOSE
ABOUT TO DIE IN PRAIMFAYA,

18:47.387 --> 18:49.824
BUT WITHOUT A TRUE
COMMANDER TO UNITE US,

18:49.867 --> 18:51.304
WE ARE WARRING CLANS.

18:51.347 --> 18:53.784
THAT IS HOW IT HAS ALWAYS
BEEN AND WILL ALWAYS BE.

18:53.828 --> 18:56.831
INDRA: ENOUGH.
HUNGER WILL MAKE IT WORSE.

18:56.874 --> 19:00.182
IF THE PEOPLE WHO TOOK THE FARM
DO NOT MAKE THEIR DEMANDS SOON--

19:00.226 --> 19:02.445
JAHA: THERE WON'T
BE ANY DEMANDS.

19:02.489 --> 19:05.274
THEY HAVE EVERYTHING
THEY NEED TO SURVIVE

19:05.318 --> 19:07.320
EXCEPT FOR ME.

19:07.363 --> 19:08.799
LOOK HERE.

19:08.843 --> 19:10.366
BECAUSE LEVEL C
CONTAINS THE FARM--

19:10.410 --> 19:13.108
ARE YOU HURT?

19:13.152 --> 19:16.285
UH, JUST A SCRATCH.

19:16.329 --> 19:18.809
BECAUSE LEVEL C
CONTAINS THE FARM

19:18.853 --> 19:20.376
AND THE WATER RECYCLER,

19:20.420 --> 19:23.074
CADOGAN BUILT IT TO BE
TOTALLY SELF-CONTAINED.

19:23.118 --> 19:25.599
EVEN IF THE REST
OF THE BUNKER FAILS,

19:25.642 --> 19:29.646
LEVEL C
REMAINS OPERATIVE.

19:29.690 --> 19:33.868
STILL WAITING
ON THE GOOD NEWS.

19:33.911 --> 19:36.784
IF I CAN REROUTE
THE ELECTRICITY

19:36.827 --> 19:39.395
FROM THE GENERATOR
ON THE LEVEL BELOW,

19:39.439 --> 19:42.355
I CAN USE THE METAL WALLS
AS GIANT CONDUCTORS.

19:42.398 --> 19:44.183
ENOUGH OF IT
SHOULD REACH THE DOOR

19:44.226 --> 19:47.142
AND SHORT OUT
THE LOCKING MECHANISMS.

19:47.186 --> 19:50.276
-YES.

19:50.319 --> 19:52.103
I SHOULD'VE
LED WITH THAT.

19:52.147 --> 19:53.279
IS LEVEL D
CLEAR?

19:53.322 --> 19:55.194
INDRA: NO MAN'S LAND,
5 DIFFERENT CLANS

19:55.237 --> 19:57.370
LOOKING FOR SOMEONE TO
TAKE THEIR ANGER OUT ON.

19:57.413 --> 19:59.894
THE SECOND THEY
SEE HIM, HE'S DEAD.

19:59.937 --> 20:02.549
THEN LET'S MAKE SURE
THEY DON'T SEE HIM.

20:02.592 --> 20:04.681
NIYLAH, CAN YOU MAKE HIM
LOOK LIKE A GROUNDER?

20:04.725 --> 20:07.554
YOU KNOW I CAN.

20:10.252 --> 20:12.950
OCTAVIA,
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS.

20:12.994 --> 20:16.345
NOT AS DANGEROUS
AS DOING NOTHING.

20:17.477 --> 20:19.392
WE SPLIT UP.

20:19.435 --> 20:21.829
YOU DRAW AS MANY PEOPLE
AS YOU CAN FROM LEVEL D,

20:21.872 --> 20:23.787
AND I'LL GET JAHA
TO THAT GENERATOR.

20:23.831 --> 20:25.311
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING?

20:25.354 --> 20:26.964
SOMETHING I
SHOULD HAVE DONE

20:27.008 --> 20:28.966
46 DAYS AGO.

20:29.010 --> 20:33.493
ON ME, THEY'RE
NOT SYMBOLS.

20:33.536 --> 20:35.582
THEY'RE TARGETS.

20:36.800 --> 20:39.238
WE CAN DO THIS.

21:09.180 --> 21:10.878
LAST ROOM
ON THE RIGHT.

21:10.921 --> 21:12.096
THIS IS WHERE
WE SPLIT UP.

21:12.140 --> 21:13.272
GET TO THE VAULT DOOR.

21:13.315 --> 21:16.275
I'LL RADIO YOU
ONCE IT'S DONE.

21:28.939 --> 21:31.507
-LET'S GO.
-UHH...

21:32.987 --> 21:35.424
MAN: THERE HE IS!

21:35.468 --> 21:37.644
GO BACK.

21:40.951 --> 21:42.605
AAH!

21:46.043 --> 21:48.219
THERE'S TOO MANY.

21:48.263 --> 21:51.135
I KNOW THIS IS HARD,
BUT IF WE DON'T SUCCEED,

21:51.179 --> 21:53.399
THAT BOY
DIES ANYWAY.

21:53.442 --> 21:56.750
NO! NO! OH!

21:56.793 --> 22:00.362
-UH!
-UGH!

22:02.103 --> 22:04.801
OHH...

22:04.845 --> 22:06.803
UGH...

22:06.847 --> 22:09.371
YOU SAID IT WAS
JUST A SCRATCH.

22:09.415 --> 22:11.547
WE WOULD HAVE TAKEN
YOU TO A DOCTOR.

22:11.591 --> 22:14.681
BOTH DOCTORS ARE ON THE
WRONG SIDE OF THAT DOOR.

22:14.724 --> 22:19.033
NOW COME ON. I DON'T
HAVE MUCH TIME LEFT.

22:30.697 --> 22:33.352
LET'S SOLVE THIS
5-MINUTE PROBLEM.

22:34.440 --> 22:38.705
THE HYDROFARM SHOULD BE
DIRECTLY ABOVE US.

22:38.748 --> 22:41.795
5-MINUTE PROBLEM.

22:41.838 --> 22:45.320
EVEN IF WE FIND A WAY
TO TAKE THE FARM BACK,

22:45.364 --> 22:48.932
THERE'S STILL TOO MANY
PEOPLE IN THIS BUNKER.

22:51.848 --> 22:54.634
THERE ALWAYS
HAVE BEEN.

22:54.677 --> 22:57.332
THIS IS IT.

23:08.299 --> 23:10.693
OHH...NNGH! OHH...

23:10.737 --> 23:12.391
I GOT YOU. I GOT--

23:12.434 --> 23:14.044
NNGH! OH...

23:14.088 --> 23:16.482
LET ME JUST HAVE
A MINUTE. OH...

23:20.224 --> 23:21.400
UH!

23:21.443 --> 23:24.272
-OHH...

23:33.760 --> 23:36.327
THAT'S TOO MUCH.

23:36.371 --> 23:37.894
NO MORE RATIONING.

23:37.938 --> 23:39.635
WE'LL JUST
SHARE ONE, ERIC.

23:39.679 --> 23:41.898
THANK YOU.

23:41.942 --> 23:44.988
MOST OF OUR PEOPLE
ARE OK WITH THIS.

23:45.032 --> 23:46.903
I CAN'T GET ANYONE
TO FIGHT BACK.

23:46.947 --> 23:48.252
THAT'S BECAUSE
THEY'RE SCARED.

23:48.296 --> 23:49.732
JACKSON, DON'T DO
ANYTHING STUPID.

23:49.776 --> 23:51.212
NATE'S OUT THERE.
I CAN'T JUST--

23:51.255 --> 23:52.474
LET'S GO.

23:54.998 --> 23:56.696
NO. WAIT, WAIT.

23:56.739 --> 23:58.524
I NEED MY PILLS.
THEY'RE IN MY BAG.

24:00.613 --> 24:02.571
NEXT TIME.

24:04.704 --> 24:07.402
IMAGINE THAT,

24:07.446 --> 24:11.188
WANTING TO SAVE
THE PERSON HE LOVES.

24:11.232 --> 24:13.190
YOU TOOK AWAY
MY CHOICE, MARCUS.

24:13.234 --> 24:14.888
I'M NOT GONNA
APOLOGIZE

24:14.931 --> 24:16.759
FOR SAVING
YOUR LIFE, ABBY.

24:16.803 --> 24:19.370
I MADE
THE RIGHT CALL.

24:19.414 --> 24:22.156
YOU'RE A DOCTOR.

24:22.199 --> 24:23.766
I WOULD'VE MADE
THE SAME DECISION,

24:23.810 --> 24:25.376
EVEN IF I DIDN'T
LOVE YOU.

24:25.420 --> 24:27.509
REALLY? THEN WHY
WERE YOU WILLING

24:27.553 --> 24:29.555
TO FLOAT ME
ON THE ARK?

24:41.305 --> 24:42.263
OH...

24:42.306 --> 24:44.613
HEY, ARE YOU
STILL WITH ME?

24:44.657 --> 24:49.618
ALL I NEED TO DO IS
CONNECT THE FINAL WIRES.

24:49.662 --> 24:52.491
THEN DO IT.
LET'S GO.

24:53.579 --> 24:55.189
NO.

24:56.451 --> 24:57.583
AGH...

24:57.626 --> 25:01.325
I KNOW YOU'VE NEVER FELT

25:01.369 --> 25:05.460
LIKE YOU WERE A PART
OF OUR PEOPLE,

25:05.504 --> 25:08.028
AND I DON'T
FAULT YOU FOR THAT.

25:08.071 --> 25:12.815
LIVING ON THE ARK MUST
HAVE BEEN SO HARD FOR YOU,

25:12.859 --> 25:16.515
SO I'M TRULY SORRY
ABOUT THAT, OCTAVIA.

25:20.344 --> 25:23.391
DO WE NEED TO TALK
ABOUT THIS RIGHT NOW?

25:23.434 --> 25:26.568
YES...

25:26.612 --> 25:31.878
BECAUSE, LIKE IT OR NOT,
WE ARE YOUR PEOPLE.

25:31.921 --> 25:34.358
WHEN YOU WON THE CONCLAVE,
YOU SAVED US, TOO.

25:37.623 --> 25:40.147
WHAT THE HELL DO YOU
WANT FROM ME, JAHA?

25:40.190 --> 25:41.844
CONNECT
THE DAMN WIRES.

25:41.888 --> 25:44.673
I SAID NO.

25:44.717 --> 25:47.894
ONCE WE OPEN THAT DOOR,
THE GROUNDERS GATHERED

25:47.937 --> 25:50.026
ON THE OUTSIDE
WILL POUR IN

25:50.070 --> 25:53.116
AND KILL EVERYONE
ON THE INSIDE,

25:53.160 --> 25:57.686
GUILTY AND INNOCENT ALIKE,
EVEN THE CHILDREN.

25:57.730 --> 25:59.993
I CAN'T LET
THAT HAPPEN.

26:00.036 --> 26:02.473
I WON'T.

26:02.517 --> 26:05.389
THEN WE ALL DIE.

26:05.433 --> 26:07.043
GO TO THE DOOR.

26:07.087 --> 26:09.959
MAKE THE GROUNDERS
STAND DOWN,

26:10.003 --> 26:13.876
AND WHEN I HAVE YOUR WORD
THAT ONLY THE GUILTY

26:13.920 --> 26:17.880
WILL BE PUNISHED,
I'LL SEND THE SURGE.

26:17.924 --> 26:19.578
THEY WON'T
LISTEN TO ME.

26:19.621 --> 26:20.970
MAKE THEM LISTEN.

26:21.014 --> 26:23.233
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE
A COMMANDER TO COMMAND.

26:23.277 --> 26:26.193
I AM NOT
A LEADER, JAHA.

26:26.236 --> 26:30.240
I'M A FIGHTER,
WARRIOR.

26:30.284 --> 26:33.940
AND A WARRIOR NEEDS
A WAR, AN ENEMY.

26:33.983 --> 26:36.072
YEAH.

26:36.116 --> 26:39.380
ON THE ARK, WE MADE
DEATH THE ENEMY.

26:39.423 --> 26:41.469
THAT'S HOW
WE SURVIVED,

26:41.512 --> 26:43.819
AND ANYONE WHO DID
ANYTHING TO PUSH US

26:43.863 --> 26:46.605
CLOSER TO DEATH
WAS ELIMINATED.

26:46.648 --> 26:49.346
YOU HATE ME BECAUSE
I FLOATED YOUR MOTHER,

26:49.390 --> 26:51.218
BUT WHEN SHE
BROKE THE LAW,

26:51.261 --> 26:54.221
SHE PUSHED US
CLOSER TO DEATH,

26:54.264 --> 26:58.704
SO SHE MADE HERSELF
THE ENEMY.

27:08.452 --> 27:10.454
UHH...

27:12.543 --> 27:14.937
SO NOW...

27:14.981 --> 27:18.027
YOU KNOW WHAT
IT TAKES TO LEAD.

27:30.431 --> 27:33.260
ALL RIGHT.
I'LL DO IT.

27:33.303 --> 27:37.046
JUST TRY NOT TO DIE
BEFORE IT'S DONE.

27:46.752 --> 27:48.797
[CLASSICAL GUITAR
PLAYING ARPEGGIOS]

28:25.138 --> 28:27.575
I COULDN'T BEAR
TO LOSE YOU.

28:27.618 --> 28:30.491
I'D JUST
GOTTEN YOU BACK.

28:30.534 --> 28:33.886
THE WORLD WAS ENDING
BEFORE OUR VERY EYES,

28:33.929 --> 28:36.323
AND I THOUGHT I COULD
WEATHER ANY STORM

28:36.366 --> 28:39.021
AS LONG AS YOU
WERE BY MY SIDE...

28:40.806 --> 28:43.722
BUT YOU WEREN'T BY
MY SIDE, WERE YOU...

28:46.333 --> 28:48.727
BECAUSE YOU DECIDED
THAT YOU DIDN'T

28:48.770 --> 28:51.599
DESERVE WHAT WE HAD,
YOU DIDN'T--

28:51.642 --> 28:54.733
YOU DIDN'T DESERVE
TO SURVIVE.

28:54.776 --> 28:58.562
I DIDN'T.

28:58.606 --> 29:00.173
HOW COULD YOU
EVER THINK THAT I

29:00.216 --> 29:02.131
WOULD BE ABLE TO
CARRY YOU OUTSIDE

29:02.175 --> 29:04.612
AND SHUT THE DOOR?

29:08.616 --> 29:11.314
ABBY, I'M SORRY, BUT
I'M NOT THAT STRONG.

29:11.358 --> 29:15.057
I WOULD DO THE SAME
THING A THOUSAND TIMES.

29:16.450 --> 29:19.148
DID YOU EVER REGRET

29:19.192 --> 29:22.543
OPENING THE DOOR
TO SAVE ME?

29:29.115 --> 29:31.770
NO.

29:54.662 --> 29:57.621
HAVE A SEAT,
DR. JACKSON.

29:57.665 --> 30:00.886
WE HAVE EVERYTHING
WE NEED--FOOD, WATER,

30:00.929 --> 30:04.367
SUPPLIES, MUSIC.

30:04.411 --> 30:06.456
WOULD YOU PLAY
A LITTLE LOUDER, PLEASE?

30:27.608 --> 30:30.654
NIYLAH:
SHE'S HERE.

30:30.698 --> 30:32.831
THERE.

30:34.528 --> 30:36.835
IS IT OPEN?
IS IT DONE?

30:36.878 --> 30:38.488
NOT YET.

30:38.532 --> 30:40.621
THERE'S SOMETHING
I NEED TO DO.

30:43.015 --> 30:45.669
OCTAVIA: HEY!

30:45.713 --> 30:48.020
I CAN OPEN THE DOOR.

30:49.717 --> 30:51.980
THEN DO IT, SKAIRIPA,
SO WE CAN RID OURSELVES

30:52.024 --> 30:55.592
OF YOUR HONORLESS PEOPLE
ONCE AND FOR ALL.

30:55.636 --> 30:57.507
YOU'RE RIGHT.

30:57.551 --> 31:02.991
THEY ARE MY PEOPLE,
BUT SO ARE YOU, ALL OF YOU.

31:03.035 --> 31:06.386
WE WILL TAKE BACK
THE FARM FOR WONKRU,

31:06.429 --> 31:08.692
AND THAT INCLUDES
THE INNOCENT PEOPLE

31:08.736 --> 31:12.348
ON THE OTHER SIDE
OF THAT DOOR.

31:12.392 --> 31:14.176
YAAGH!

31:14.220 --> 31:15.699
UH! UGH...

31:15.743 --> 31:19.790
NO. SHE NEEDS
TO DO THIS HERSELF.

31:19.834 --> 31:25.100
YOU ARE WONKRU,
OR YOU ARE THE ENEMY OF WONKRU.

31:25.144 --> 31:26.449
-CHOOSE.
-RAAGH!

31:26.493 --> 31:29.800
AGH! UHH...

31:29.844 --> 31:31.715
FOR JAHA.

31:36.198 --> 31:40.159
YOU ARE WONKRU,
OR YOU ARE THE ENEMY OF WONKRU.

31:40.202 --> 31:41.812
CHOOSE.

31:41.856 --> 31:43.336
RRAGH!

31:43.379 --> 31:44.903

31:46.426 --> 31:48.907
-AAH!
-UGH...UH!

31:50.734 --> 31:54.782
YOU ARE WONKRU,
OR YOU ARE THE ENEMY OF WONKRU.

31:54.825 --> 31:57.219
CHOOSE.

31:57.263 --> 32:00.048
-YAAGH!
-UH!

32:00.092 --> 32:01.180
UGH!

32:01.223 --> 32:03.051
-UH!

32:03.095 --> 32:04.879
-HUH!
-OHH...

32:04.923 --> 32:06.794
AGH...UH!

32:10.624 --> 32:16.195
YOU ARE WONKRU,
OR YOU ARE THE ENEMY OF WONKRU.

32:16.238 --> 32:18.632
CHOOSE.

32:24.290 --> 32:26.074
-UH!
-OHH!

32:26.118 --> 32:28.859
HUH! UH! YAH!

32:28.903 --> 32:30.774
HAH!

32:38.652 --> 32:43.831
YOU ARE WONKRU,
OR YOU ARE THE ENEMY OF WONKRU.

32:45.572 --> 32:48.662
CHOOSE.

33:23.523 --> 33:25.742
IT'S OVER.

33:27.527 --> 33:30.443
OPEN THE DOOR.

33:46.981 --> 33:49.766
MAN: LET'S MOVE!
LET'S GO!

33:49.810 --> 33:52.769
COOPER, WHAT IS IT?
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

33:53.727 --> 33:57.731
COOPER, DON'T.
NO. WAIT. DON'T!

34:01.213 --> 34:03.302
AAH!

34:03.345 --> 34:05.739
IT WON'T BE THAT EASY.

34:09.090 --> 34:11.310
-OVER THERE!

34:14.878 --> 34:16.358
THELONIOUS...

34:18.839 --> 34:22.060
IT'S NOT JUST BLOOD.
IT'S BILE.

34:22.103 --> 34:24.192
I THINK HE PERFORATED
HIS LIVER.

34:24.236 --> 34:26.064
I NEED SOMETHING SHARP.

34:26.107 --> 34:28.501
I NEED TO GET
IN THERE NOW.

34:28.544 --> 34:31.025
ABBY...

34:31.069 --> 34:34.768
YOU CAN'T FIX ME
THIS TIME.

34:34.811 --> 34:37.205
KANE: THELONIOUS...

34:37.249 --> 34:39.207
THELONIOUS, FIGHT.

34:39.251 --> 34:43.559
OCTAVIA: I THINK
HIS FIGHT IS OVER.

34:43.603 --> 34:46.258
JAHA: OCTAVIA...

34:48.434 --> 34:55.223
PROMISE ME THAT
YOU'LL TAKE CARE OF ETHAN.

34:56.616 --> 34:58.922
YOU HAVE MY WORD.

34:58.966 --> 35:01.751
I'LL TAKE CARE
OF THE BOY.

35:01.795 --> 35:04.798
JUST TAKE ME
HOME, MARCUS.

35:06.800 --> 35:09.411
TAKE ME TO MY WIFE.

35:13.981 --> 35:16.505
TAKE ME TO WELLS.

35:22.642 --> 35:26.602
IN PEACE,
MAY YOU LEAVE THE SHORE.

35:29.170 --> 35:32.130
IN LOVE, MAY YOU REACH
THE NEXT.

35:32.173 --> 35:35.655
SAFE PASSAGE
ON YOUR TRAVELS...

35:37.613 --> 35:40.442
UNTIL OUR FINAL JOURNEY
TO THE GROUND.

35:46.579 --> 35:48.233
OHH...

35:52.541 --> 35:55.936
MAY WE MEET AGAIN.

35:55.979 --> 35:57.677
BOTH:
MAY WE MEET AGAIN.

35:57.720 --> 36:00.332
MAY WE MEET
AGAIN.

36:22.397 --> 36:25.270
YOUR PEOPLE
AWAIT JUSTICE.

36:26.401 --> 36:29.796
COME. LET'S CLEAN
YOU UP BEFORE--

36:29.839 --> 36:31.624
-NO.
-GAIA...

36:31.667 --> 36:35.193
IF YOU DARE SAY THE SPIRITS
OF THE COMMANDERS OBJECT,

36:35.236 --> 36:37.586
THEN I MUST REMIND YOU
THAT THOSE SPIRITS

36:37.630 --> 36:39.022
HAVE ABANDONED US.

36:39.066 --> 36:41.634
I DON'T BELIEVE
THEY HAVE.

36:45.855 --> 36:48.336
MY MOTHER IS CORRECT.

36:48.380 --> 36:50.686
OUR FAITH DICTATES THAT
ONLY A TRUE COMMANDER

36:50.730 --> 36:53.820
CAN UNITE THE CLANS,
THAT WITHOUT A NATBLIDA,

36:53.863 --> 36:56.083
WE WOULD BE LOST.

36:56.126 --> 36:58.825
THEN YOU WON
THE CONCLAVE.

37:00.566 --> 37:03.525
YOU DELIVERED US
FROM PRAIMFAYA.

37:03.569 --> 37:06.398
TODAY YOU DELIVERED
US FROM STARVATION.

37:06.441 --> 37:09.270
I NOW BELIEVE THAT YOU

37:09.314 --> 37:11.794
WILL DELIVER US
BACK TO THE GROUND.

37:14.144 --> 37:17.278
COME. YOU'LL NEED
CLEAN ARMOR.

37:17.322 --> 37:20.760
LEAVE IT. LET THEM
SEE HER LIKE THIS.

37:30.944 --> 37:34.817
THE BLOOD
OF OUR ENEMIES

37:34.861 --> 37:38.256
IS HER ARMOR.

37:45.350 --> 37:48.396
MAN: ON YOUR KNEES
WITH THE OTHERS.

37:48.440 --> 37:50.616
HEY, HEY, WHAT
ARE YOU DOING?

37:50.659 --> 37:52.444
WATCH IT.

37:56.883 --> 37:58.580
MAN: YOU CAN'T
DO THIS!

37:58.624 --> 38:00.539
NATE.

38:02.889 --> 38:05.108
I TRIED TO STOP IT.
I TRIED, BUT NOBODY--

38:05.152 --> 38:07.154
SHH, SSH.
IT'S OK. I KNOW.

38:07.197 --> 38:09.461
LOOK. YOU'RE A HEALER,
NOT A FIGHTER.

38:09.504 --> 38:12.638
THAT'S WHY I LOVE YOU.

38:23.475 --> 38:26.608
OCTAVIA: THERE ARE TOO MANY
PEOPLE IN THIS BUNKER...

38:28.480 --> 38:31.221
AND IF WE DON'T DO SOMETHING
ABOUT THIS,

38:31.265 --> 38:33.615
NONE OF US WILL SURVIVE
TO SEE THE SUN,

38:33.659 --> 38:38.272
THE SKY, THE GROUND,
AND I WON'T LET THAT HAPPEN.

38:40.405 --> 38:45.148
EACH OF YOU HAVE COMMITTED
CRIMES AGAINST WONKRU,

38:45.192 --> 38:47.890
AND THE PUNISHMENT FOR THIS...

38:51.329 --> 38:53.592
IS DEATH.

38:54.506 --> 38:55.637
MAN: THIS IS NONSENSE!

38:55.681 --> 38:57.335
DELPHI DOESN'T DESERVE
TO BE DOWN THERE

38:57.378 --> 38:58.814
FOR STEALING BLANKETS.

38:58.858 --> 39:00.425
SKAIKRU STOLE FOOD.

39:00.468 --> 39:01.904
THERE IS NO SKAIKRU.

39:01.948 --> 39:05.212
THERE IS ONLY WONKRU AND
THE ENEMIES OF WONKRU.

39:05.255 --> 39:08.737
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO JOIN THEM?

39:08.781 --> 39:12.741
BUT THIS ISN'T THE ARK, AND
THIS ISN'T THE GROUND, EITHER.

39:12.785 --> 39:16.441
THERE IS NO
BLOOD MUST HAVE BLOOD.

39:17.964 --> 39:23.099
IN ROME, THE GLADIATORS
HAD THE OPPORTUNITY

39:23.143 --> 39:25.928
TO FIGHT FOR THEIR FREEDOM...

39:31.194 --> 39:33.371
ON YOUR FEET.

39:36.156 --> 39:39.289
AND SO WILL YOU.

39:47.472 --> 39:49.387
OCTAVIA: CONCLAVE RULES.

39:51.389 --> 39:53.869
WIN THE FIGHT,

39:53.913 --> 39:55.871
SAVE YOUR LIFE.

39:59.092 --> 40:01.921
UH! HUH!

40:04.184 --> 40:06.099
MAN: AGH! OH!

40:06.142 --> 40:08.928
HUH! YAAH!

40:48.620 --> 40:49.621
UH!

41:00.849 --> 41:04.723
BLODREINA, WHAT IS
OUR CHAMPION'S FATE?

41:22.392 --> 41:24.394
YEAH!

41:25.831 --> 41:28.964
BRING IN THE NEXT
COMBATANTS.

41:35.710 --> 41:37.843
RAAGH!
