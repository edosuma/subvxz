00:02.291 --> 00:04.834
OPTIMUS:

00:02.291 --> 00:04.834
We will meet

00:02.291 --> 00:04.834
on the field of battle.

00:04.875 --> 00:07.583
The road ahead

00:04.875 --> 00:07.583
will be difficult,

00:07.625 --> 00:10.125
more so than you believe.

00:10.166 --> 00:11.959
Rest assured,

00:12.000 --> 00:14.875
you will be pushed

00:12.000 --> 00:14.875
beyond your limits.

00:14.917 --> 00:18.709
But remember, your strength

00:14.917 --> 00:18.709
resides within you.

00:18.750 --> 00:21.041
As do your duty and honor.

00:21.083 --> 00:24.417
Therefore, rise up,

00:21.083 --> 00:24.417
each of you.

00:24.458 --> 00:27.250
Glory awaits the victor.

00:27.291 --> 00:28.667
Transform!

00:28.709 --> 00:30.709
(  upbeat theme playing  )

00:33.500 --> 00:34.750
All right,

00:34.792 --> 00:36.667
let's run a clean race.

00:36.709 --> 00:39.125
That means elbows in,

00:36.709 --> 00:39.125
Heatwave.

00:39.166 --> 00:40.667
( groans )

00:40.709 --> 00:42.208
On your marks.

00:42.250 --> 00:44.792
Get set...

00:47.208 --> 00:48.875
FRANKIE:

00:47.208 --> 00:48.875
Go!

00:48.917 --> 00:51.917
Eat dino dust, bipeds.

00:48.917 --> 00:51.917
Frankie?

00:51.959 --> 00:54.000
Hey, Autobots only.

00:51.959 --> 00:54.000
CHASE: That is patently unfair.

00:54.041 --> 00:55.959
BLADES: She's gonna win!

00:54.041 --> 00:55.959
BOULDER: Run, run, run!

00:56.000 --> 00:58.750
I believe two

00:56.000 --> 00:58.750
can play at that game.

00:58.792 --> 01:01.625
Primal Mode!

01:01.667 --> 01:03.458
Noble!

01:07.250 --> 01:09.250
Come on, Boulder,

01:07.250 --> 01:09.250
you can do this.

01:09.291 --> 01:12.291
I think I can.

01:12.333 --> 01:14.333
The Little Engine

01:12.333 --> 01:14.333

01:14.375 --> 01:16.667
One of my favorite

01:14.375 --> 01:16.667

01:16.709 --> 01:19.583
Nice to know you've kept up

01:16.709 --> 01:19.583
with your reading, Boulder.

01:19.625 --> 01:21.458
Though perhaps

01:19.625 --> 01:21.458
a more apt story would be

01:21.500 --> 01:22.750
"The Tortoise and the Hare."

01:22.792 --> 01:24.875
Because Boulder is last.

01:24.917 --> 01:28.333
Don't listen to him, Boulder.

01:24.917 --> 01:28.333
Slow and steady wins the race.

01:28.375 --> 01:30.709
Heh, heh.

01:28.375 --> 01:30.709
Boulder's a Tortoise.

01:30.750 --> 01:32.250
( Blades laughs )

01:32.291 --> 01:34.291
You got time to laugh,

01:32.291 --> 01:34.291
you got time to run harder.

01:34.333 --> 01:35.959
I wanna win this.

01:37.542 --> 01:40.125
Remember, we won't be

01:37.542 --> 01:40.125
goofing off like the hare,

01:40.166 --> 01:42.375
so the tortoise

01:40.166 --> 01:42.375
can't possibly-- Whoa!

01:42.417 --> 01:43.875
Ugh!

01:46.458 --> 01:48.417

We're catching them.

01:53.709 --> 01:55.750
Good.

01:55.792 --> 01:59.417
The sooner I can convert

01:55.792 --> 01:59.417
out of Primal Mode, the better.

This form

01:59.458 --> 02:02.625

because...

What was I saying?

06:11.291 --> 06:14.375

06:11.291 --> 06:14.375
to all my hunting enthusiasts

around the world.

06:16.417 --> 06:18.041
I am happy to announce

06:18.083 --> 06:22.625
that Quarry Safariland

06:18.083 --> 06:22.625
is back in operation.

06:22.667 --> 06:24.667
So what

06:22.667 --> 06:24.667
if the authorities keep us

06:24.709 --> 06:26.917
from stalking real animals?

06:26.959 --> 06:30.500
Oh, I have something even better

06:26.959 --> 06:30.500
to set your sights on.

06:30.542 --> 06:34.000
The most powerful predator

06:30.542 --> 06:34.000
you'll ever hunt.

06:34.041 --> 06:36.208

You'll have to wait your turn,

though.

06:57.041 --> 07:01.917
Oh, this first hunt

06:57.041 --> 07:01.917
is all mine.

07:01.959 --> 07:05.792
So using this freeze-frame

07:01.959 --> 07:05.792
taken from Huxley's video,

07:05.834 --> 07:07.917
I ran an Internet search

07:05.834 --> 07:07.917
for a match.

07:07.959 --> 07:10.083
Normally Graham gets to do

07:07.959 --> 07:10.083
this kind of stuff,

07:10.125 --> 07:12.208
but, yeah,

07:10.125 --> 07:12.208
I kind of rocked it.

07:13.333 --> 07:15.125
See, got a hit.

07:15.166 --> 07:18.166
Colonel Quint Quarry,

07:15.166 --> 07:18.166
a big game hunter

07:18.208 --> 07:21.250
known for hosting

07:18.208 --> 07:21.250
illegal safaris on his island.

07:21.291 --> 07:23.375
The very nerve.

07:21.291 --> 07:23.375
What's a safari?

07:23.417 --> 07:26.417
I have no idea.

07:23.417 --> 07:26.417
In this case, it's a hunt.

07:26.458 --> 07:29.625
And now he's stalking Optimus.

07:26.458 --> 07:29.625
With Cody caught in the middle.

07:29.667 --> 07:32.500
Hopefully little squirt knows

07:29.667 --> 07:32.500
enough to stay out of sight.

07:32.542 --> 07:35.458
From what I've read,

07:32.542 --> 07:35.458
Quarry catches and releases.

07:35.500 --> 07:38.208
He won't hurt anything

07:35.500 --> 07:38.208
too expensive to replace.

07:38.250 --> 07:39.834
The risk is still high.

07:39.875 --> 07:42.834
We must locate

07:39.875 --> 07:42.834
this safari island immediately.

07:42.875 --> 07:45.125
If not sooner.

07:42.875 --> 07:45.125
What's sooner than immediately?

07:45.166 --> 07:46.709
I have no idea.

07:46.750 --> 07:50.250
Find him. That man messed

07:46.750 --> 07:50.250
with the wrong family!

07:50.291 --> 07:52.542
Sure did.

07:52.583 --> 07:54.333
Ow.

07:56.792 --> 07:59.041
Any luck finding what's wrong

07:56.792 --> 07:59.041
with Optimus?

07:59.083 --> 08:01.041
We think it's reduced

07:59.083 --> 08:01.041
energon levels.

08:01.083 --> 08:02.792
From scanning Trex.

08:02.834 --> 08:05.917
And that lowered his resistance

08:02.834 --> 08:05.917
to foreign bodies in his system.

08:05.959 --> 08:07.375
Like when we get tired,

08:07.417 --> 08:09.542
we have a harder time

08:07.417 --> 08:09.542
fighting off colds.

08:09.583 --> 08:11.000
But what foreign bodies?

08:11.041 --> 08:14.417
My guess,

08:11.041 --> 08:14.417
the real dinosaur DNA we used

08:14.458 --> 08:15.875
in Trex's construction.

08:15.917 --> 08:17.333
Who knew

08:15.917 --> 08:17.333
scanning techno-organics

08:17.375 --> 08:18.667
could cause

08:17.375 --> 08:18.667
something like this?

08:18.709 --> 08:20.041
So, what's the solution?

08:20.083 --> 08:22.583
Restoring Optimus'

08:20.083 --> 08:22.583
energon levels may work.

08:22.625 --> 08:25.375
To make sure, I'm working up

08:22.625 --> 08:25.375
an equation to test the theory.

08:25.417 --> 08:27.583
Found the island.

08:25.417 --> 08:27.583
It wasn't hard.

08:27.625 --> 08:29.875
Quarry named it

08:27.625 --> 08:29.875
after himself.

08:29.917 --> 08:32.125
You four keep working

08:29.917 --> 08:32.125
on this.

08:32.166 --> 08:34.959
The rest of us are paying

08:32.166 --> 08:34.959
a visit to Colonel Quarry.

08:38.917 --> 08:42.125
Might as well give up now,

08:38.917 --> 08:42.125
Dino Bot.

08:42.166 --> 08:43.667
I'm the best.

08:43.709 --> 08:46.417
I'm in the record book.

08:43.709 --> 08:46.417
Heh, heh.

08:46.458 --> 08:48.542
You can look it up

08:53.041 --> 08:56.375

09:00.542 --> 09:02.208
That's right.

From what I've heard,

12:00.166 --> 12:02.542
scanning a third form

is a big deal.

12:02.583 --> 12:05.542
Best way to prove this will work

is to use it on myself.

19:18.417 --> 19:21.000
Come on, you lazy bird,

19:18.417 --> 19:21.000
up you go!

19:24.458 --> 19:26.583
I'll guarantee

19:24.458 --> 19:26.583
the titan gorillas of the Congo

19:26.625 --> 19:28.500
didn't have one of these.

19:28.542 --> 19:30.583
Power up and energize!

19:32.166 --> 19:34.625
I think I can.

19:34.667 --> 19:37.291
( panting )

19:34.667 --> 19:37.291
Hope you don't mind, Optimus.

19:37.333 --> 19:39.917
( Boulder grunting )

19:41.000 --> 19:42.625
Land this aircraft!

19:42.667 --> 19:44.208
( banging on door )

19:44.250 --> 19:46.542
He means now.

19:51.417 --> 19:53.375
( Quarry grunts )

19:53.417 --> 19:56.750
Uh... What if I

19:53.417 --> 19:56.750
offered

19:56.792 --> 20:00.709
to purchase those highly

19:56.792 --> 20:00.709
advanced machines of yours?

20:00.750 --> 20:02.709
I'd buy as many

20:00.750 --> 20:02.709
as you could build.

20:02.750 --> 20:04.792
Commissioner?

20:10.834 --> 20:13.792
I'll give you time

20:10.834 --> 20:13.792
to think about it.

20:13.834 --> 20:15.041
( chuckles )

20:15.083 --> 20:16.834
Lots of time.

20:16.875 --> 20:19.333
So, what do you think

20:16.875 --> 20:19.333
of Boulder's new look?

20:19.375 --> 20:21.083
I think

20:19.375 --> 20:21.083
it kind of suits him.

20:21.125 --> 20:23.917
And one more triple-changer

20:21.125 --> 20:23.917
on the team might come in handy.

20:23.959 --> 20:26.917
Yeah,

20:23.959 --> 20:26.917
but a horn-a-top thing?

20:26.959 --> 20:28.208
What good is that?

20:28.250 --> 20:31.041
Triceratops.

20:28.250 --> 20:31.041
And you never know.

20:31.083 --> 20:33.333
I just hope Blades doesn't

20:31.083 --> 20:33.333
wanna be a dinosaur now.

20:33.375 --> 20:35.875
Don't worry.

20:33.375 --> 20:35.875
When I choose a third form,

20:35.917 --> 20:38.709
it'll be something safe,

20:35.917 --> 20:38.709
like a moped.

20:38.750 --> 20:41.208
Boulder, just as

20:38.750 --> 20:41.208
in "The Tortoise and the Hare,"

20:41.250 --> 20:43.834
you did, in fact, cross

20:41.250 --> 20:43.834
the finish line victorious.

20:43.875 --> 20:46.542
Yeah, but I don't mind you

20:43.875 --> 20:46.542
lagging behind, big guy.

20:46.583 --> 20:47.959
Means you have our back.

20:49.208 --> 20:50.750
Appreciate that.

20:50.792 --> 20:54.458
I would like to thank all of you

20:50.792 --> 20:54.458
for coming to my rescue.

20:54.500 --> 20:57.041
Though I did not

20:54.500 --> 20:57.041
make it easy.

20:57.083 --> 20:58.959
Especially for Cody.

20:59.000 --> 21:01.959
I did hear you throughout

20:59.000 --> 21:01.959
the ordeal, young man.

21:02.000 --> 21:05.083
Your common sense

21:02.000 --> 21:05.083
and compassion

21:05.125 --> 21:08.875
kept things from becoming worse

21:05.125 --> 21:08.875
than they could have.

21:08.917 --> 21:11.333
Thank you, Optimus.

21:08.917 --> 21:11.333
I'm just glad--

21:11.375 --> 21:14.250
Ah! Colonel Quarry.

21:11.375 --> 21:14.250
He's gone.

21:14.291 --> 21:15.750
That's not good.

21:14.291 --> 21:15.750
Where'd he go?

21:15.792 --> 21:17.208
How did he even get out?

21:17.250 --> 21:19.959
One thing I know

21:17.250 --> 21:19.959
about big game hunters,

21:20.000 --> 21:21.917
they remember the ones

21:20.000 --> 21:21.917
that got away.

21:21.959 --> 21:23.500
That means he'll be back.

21:23.542 --> 21:25.333
And that means

21:23.542 --> 21:25.333
we'll be waiting.

21:25.375 --> 21:27.333
Sure will.

21:27.375 --> 21:29.375
Ow.

21:30.500 --> 21:33.709
(  dramatic theme playing  )
