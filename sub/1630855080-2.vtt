00:17.559 --> 00:20.228
- (grunting)
- Child (quietly): Ah! Ah!

00:20.228 --> 00:22.772
Boom. Boom.
Hey, get back here.

00:22.772 --> 00:24.441
Bang, bang, bang.

00:26.109 --> 00:29.612
(imitates machine gun)
Ah! Ah! Get away from me! Ah!

00:29.612 --> 00:31.823
(imitates machine gun,
bomb whistling, explosion)

00:31.823 --> 00:34.492
Oh no.
I didn't mean to get you.
I meant that guy.

00:34.492 --> 00:37.537
(imitates bomb whistle,
explosion) Ah! Ah! Ah!

00:37.537 --> 00:39.914
Oh no, what did you do?
I don't know.

00:40.874 --> 00:42.375
Barry's Dad:
Barry!

00:43.543 --> 00:46.755
- (wind blowing)
- (chatter fades)

00:51.718 --> 00:54.971
- Monroe, this is
my youngest son, Barry.
- Ah, hey there, big guy.

00:54.971 --> 00:57.515
Your dad, uh,
tells me you're shy.

00:57.515 --> 00:59.809
You gonna be shy
with me? (laughs)

01:00.602 --> 01:02.312
Barry, say hello.

01:02.312 --> 01:05.940
Ah, it's o-- Hey. I-I hear
you like, uh, playing army.

01:05.940 --> 01:08.526
You know, your dad
and I used to play army.

01:09.819 --> 01:11.196
- Barry!
- No, it's alright.

01:11.196 --> 01:13.114
No need to pressure
him there, John.

01:13.114 --> 01:15.492
Hey, it was nice
to meet you,

01:15.492 --> 01:17.494
son. It really was.

01:17.494 --> 01:20.330
You know, maybe
one of these days, uh,

01:20.330 --> 01:22.457
you'll let me play army
with you, yeah?

01:22.457 --> 01:25.710
(wind blowing)

01:27.796 --> 01:31.174
- (fluorescent lights buzz)
- (tapping)

01:32.425 --> 01:34.010
What do you mean
there's no deal?

01:34.010 --> 01:37.180
I'm saying you guys
are asking me
to turn against a friend,

01:37.180 --> 01:38.723
and I can't do that.

01:38.723 --> 01:40.558
But that wasn't us.

01:40.558 --> 01:43.353
You guys were already
in a friend fight.

01:43.353 --> 01:45.855
We have a process in motion
of giving you a new life.

01:45.855 --> 01:48.650
- Why would you turn
away from that?
- Fuches: Gentlemen.

01:48.650 --> 01:50.443
I don't think I should
say anything else

01:50.443 --> 01:54.155
without my attorney,
Gale Winograde, present.

01:56.241 --> 01:58.576
(sighs)

01:58.576 --> 02:00.620
Gale Winograde
is your attorney?

02:00.620 --> 02:03.456
As of this morning, yeah.

02:05.583 --> 02:08.294
I will leave you with this.

02:09.045 --> 02:10.463
Shame on you.

02:10.463 --> 02:13.174
Turning pals into enemies.

02:14.050 --> 02:15.844
It's a dick move.

02:15.844 --> 02:19.055
Cowboy (on TV):
<i>Your daddy's gonna be
real mad at me.</i>

02:19.055 --> 02:21.474
<i>And he... he's got
every right to be,</i>

02:21.474 --> 02:24.352
<i>so I don't want you
sticking up for me--</i>

02:24.352 --> 02:27.230
I'd, uh, (clears throat)
I'd like to introduce myself.

02:27.230 --> 02:29.524
I'm the Raven.

02:29.524 --> 02:31.192
Over there is my associate,

02:31.192 --> 02:32.694
Barry Berkman.

02:32.694 --> 02:34.445
You probably saw him
on the news.

02:34.445 --> 02:37.365
He's a badass cop killer.

02:37.365 --> 02:39.784
(TV continues)

02:39.784 --> 02:43.872
The Raven is connected
to some very heavy hitters.

02:43.872 --> 02:46.541
I can't say who.
Let's just say,

02:46.541 --> 02:48.793
they're not Russian, but...

02:50.295 --> 02:51.546
you'd think they were.

02:51.546 --> 02:53.381
- Inmate: They Chechens?
- Yeah, they're Chechen,

02:53.381 --> 02:55.675
but when the Raven
gets outta here,

02:55.675 --> 02:58.094
they're gonna hook him up,
and you could get

02:58.094 --> 02:59.888
a piece of the action.

02:59.888 --> 03:02.557
- Fuches: What's your name, son?
- Jason.

03:02.557 --> 03:04.350
(scoffs) Jason? No.

03:04.350 --> 03:07.061
Raven can't have a Jason.

03:07.061 --> 03:09.314
Need something
with more flair.

03:09.314 --> 03:10.565
Live Wire.

03:10.565 --> 03:12.817
- Fuches: What's your name?
- I'm trying to watch a show.

03:12.817 --> 03:15.153
TV fan, are you? Well,

03:15.153 --> 03:17.947
we'll call you...
TV-- Groove Tube!

03:17.947 --> 03:21.075
- I don't want a nickname.
- Live Wire and Groove Tube.

03:21.075 --> 03:24.078
Yeah, looks like the Raven
got himself a gang.

03:24.078 --> 03:26.205
No, for real,
I don't like nicknames.

03:26.205 --> 03:27.498
Alright, then you're Jason.

03:27.498 --> 03:29.167
Dude, I'm Jason.
My name is Jason.

03:29.167 --> 03:30.627
You're Live Wire,
motherfuck!

03:30.627 --> 03:33.796
You're Jason,
you're Live Wire,
and I'm the Raven!

03:33.796 --> 03:35.798
That speech
was really good.

03:35.798 --> 03:37.967
- Thank you.
- Now, you had...

03:37.967 --> 03:40.053
I've been taking these
acting classes and stuff,

03:40.053 --> 03:41.971
and you knew exactly...

03:41.971 --> 03:45.433
- how to play that. You're--
- Felt relaxed.

03:45.433 --> 03:47.477
Yeah, felt honest, relaxed.

03:47.477 --> 03:49.187
You know, you weren't
pushing it at all.

03:49.187 --> 03:52.607
- You were just confident--
- Do you like the names
that I came up with?

03:54.067 --> 03:55.401
Yeah.

03:56.945 --> 03:58.196
Yeah. No, those were good.

03:58.196 --> 04:00.406
Figure it'll take this lawyer
a long time

04:00.406 --> 04:03.493
to finally spring us, so...

04:03.493 --> 04:06.913
we get ourselves a little
contingent, a little...

04:06.913 --> 04:09.332
- safety in numbers.
- Yeah.

04:09.332 --> 04:11.626
- I'll get 'em in line. Yeah.
- Good.

04:11.626 --> 04:13.002
Can't believe those Feds

04:13.002 --> 04:15.505
trying to talk me
into wearing a wire.

04:15.505 --> 04:17.340
Really, I'm...

04:17.340 --> 04:19.092
I'm sorry, buddy.

04:19.092 --> 04:21.719
- No, I get it. It's okay.
- Yeah.

04:21.719 --> 04:24.013
Gonna get me a new life.

04:24.013 --> 04:26.432
Witness protection.

04:26.432 --> 04:28.810
And I said, "Fuck off."

04:28.810 --> 04:31.020
I can't do that to family.

04:33.731 --> 04:37.360
Oh, Winograde can
meet us at 3:00 PM.

04:37.360 --> 04:39.028
- Okay. Alright.
- Mm-hmm.

04:39.028 --> 04:42.407
Interested to see what he says.
Apparently, he's a beast.

04:43.616 --> 04:46.744
(boats rumbling)

04:57.964 --> 05:00.383
(ship horn blows)

05:02.635 --> 05:04.012
Cristobal:
Bong?

05:05.680 --> 05:07.015
Bong!

05:07.724 --> 05:09.225
Bong:
Cristobal?

05:09.225 --> 05:11.477
I see you are still
in the shipping business.

05:11.477 --> 05:12.729
What do you want?

05:12.729 --> 05:16.399
A while ago, Hank and I
approached you with a deal.

05:16.399 --> 05:19.360
The crime utopia thing.
I remember.

05:19.360 --> 05:22.113
- Played volleyball.
- Cristobal: (laughs) Yes, well,

05:22.113 --> 05:23.614
we are back in business,
my friend,

05:23.614 --> 05:27.452
and we have an operations that
we could use your services for.

05:27.452 --> 05:29.078
It would be an equal share.

05:29.078 --> 05:31.372
Who else is involved?

05:31.372 --> 05:34.083
Well, we are holding a meeting
with, hopefully, you.

05:34.083 --> 05:36.169
And the Guatemalans.

05:37.962 --> 05:40.214
We're at war
with those motherfuckers.

05:40.214 --> 05:43.342
You'll never get us
at a table together.

05:43.342 --> 05:46.262
Eh... I think I can.

05:46.262 --> 05:49.557
If that table happens to be at
the bestest place on the earth.

05:49.557 --> 05:52.643
(loud video game effects)

05:52.643 --> 05:54.687
Before we start,

05:54.687 --> 05:56.397
I have to applaud you.

05:56.397 --> 05:59.108
It's not an easy task,
putting aside differences,

05:59.108 --> 06:01.444
trading out your guns
for your listening ears,

06:01.444 --> 06:02.820
then trucking all the way

06:02.820 --> 06:05.782
to the Dave and the Busters
here in Torrance.

06:05.782 --> 06:08.910
It takes a strong will
to do such things.

06:08.910 --> 06:10.912
I would know.
Not long ago,

06:10.912 --> 06:13.039
I was the head of
the Bolivian cartel.

06:13.039 --> 06:14.916
We were at war
with the Chechens.

06:14.916 --> 06:17.043
They belittled us, fought us,

06:17.043 --> 06:20.088
stole from us, completely
destroyed our operations.

06:20.088 --> 06:21.631
But now... (laughs)

06:21.631 --> 06:23.466
We're fucking.

06:23.466 --> 06:25.468
Not implying that's where
you guys are headed.

06:25.468 --> 06:28.679
I understand Cristobal and I
are total unicorn situation.

06:28.679 --> 06:32.767
The point is, we were able
to put aside a major blood feud

06:32.767 --> 06:34.185
and the only way
to do such a thing

06:34.185 --> 06:36.062
is by first admitting

06:36.062 --> 06:38.189
what you don't do well.

06:38.189 --> 06:39.941
By admitting what you need.

06:39.941 --> 06:42.902
See, the Chechens had style
and distribution,

06:42.902 --> 06:45.446
but we were complete boners
at stealing shit.

06:45.446 --> 06:46.781
And we were the best of thieves,

06:46.781 --> 06:49.283
but had no idea
how to distribute.

06:49.283 --> 06:52.370
And we were too busy
blowing the shit
out of each other

06:52.370 --> 06:55.248
to realize that
we needed each other.

06:55.248 --> 06:58.084
Our strengths could help
each other's weaknesses.

06:58.084 --> 07:00.378
Together, we were stronger.

07:00.378 --> 07:01.754
Together,
we are stronger.

07:01.754 --> 07:03.840
Okay, say that shit
in your mind right now.

07:03.840 --> 07:05.383
Make it your mantra.
And at first,

07:05.383 --> 07:07.009
I get that you may need
to hold your nose

07:07.009 --> 07:08.678
when working with someone
who might have killed

07:08.678 --> 07:11.305
a close friend or family member.
That sucks, but...

07:11.305 --> 07:12.974
That shit will fade away
when you see

07:12.974 --> 07:15.101
the amazing bounty of power

07:15.101 --> 07:16.853
that comes with
working together.

07:16.853 --> 07:20.439
Now, we have a pitch
that will bring us all together

07:20.439 --> 07:22.692
in a way that
we will all profit,

07:22.692 --> 07:26.445
where we will all succeed
beyond our wildest imagination,

07:26.445 --> 07:28.865
but there must be
zero bloodshed!

07:28.865 --> 07:30.783
Hello!
Can I start you guys
with an appetizer?

07:30.783 --> 07:33.953
Uh, yes, we'll have
some jalapeno poppers
for the table, please.

07:33.953 --> 07:37.331
The killing must stop!

07:37.331 --> 07:40.918
If the Bolivians
and the Chechens
can do it...

07:42.211 --> 07:43.921
we all...

07:44.589 --> 07:45.798
can do it.

07:45.798 --> 07:49.093

- (patrons cheer)

07:55.308 --> 07:56.559
Cristobal:
Yes! Okay,

07:56.559 --> 07:59.228
fantastic!
Okay, everyone, everyone,

07:59.228 --> 08:02.023
come with me,
and we will all go to
the Wicked Tuna right here.

08:02.023 --> 08:04.233
Right here. Okay,
come with me, come with me.

08:04.233 --> 08:07.403
- Look, right over here,
we have the Pac-Man. Huh?
- (phone buzzing)

08:07.403 --> 08:11.324
We have the Hungry Hippo.
And we have the Skee-ball...

Come on, let's go.

I'm sorry.

09:40.454 --> 09:43.457

09:43.457 --> 09:45.001
How are you?

09:46.127 --> 09:48.296
(sighs) I fucked up.

I'm really sorry, Sally.

Sally:
How's Muffin?

09:55.094 --> 09:57.513
- Who's Muffin?
- Sally: Muffin. Our dog, Muffin.

09:57.513 --> 09:59.849
Remember, before
you were arrested?

09:59.849 --> 10:01.267
Muffin bit me, and you said

10:01.267 --> 10:03.811
you were gonna find him
a new home. Did you?

10:04.895 --> 10:06.814
I told you what I did to Muffin.

10:06.814 --> 10:07.982
No, you didn't tell me.

10:07.982 --> 10:10.318
That's why I flew
all the way here.

10:12.570 --> 10:13.863
Where's the dog buried?

10:13.863 --> 10:17.241
Honey, the dog
h-has a new home.
The dog's safe.

10:18.576 --> 10:21.120
You got nothing to worry about.
You're okay.

10:21.787 --> 10:23.164
(Barry sighs)

10:31.672 --> 10:33.924
Is that the only thing
you came here for?

10:35.384 --> 10:36.469
Yeah.

10:40.473 --> 10:43.642
- Then, why aren't you leaving?
- (Sally sniffles)

10:48.981 --> 10:51.442
I tried to go home,
and... (inhales)

10:51.442 --> 10:53.569
it was just so awful.

10:53.569 --> 10:56.364
Barry:
Sally, I didn't--
I didn't lie to you.

10:56.364 --> 10:59.283
- You did... You did.
- Barry: I didn't lie to you.

10:59.283 --> 11:00.618
I didn't lie to you.
I just...

11:00.618 --> 11:03.204
I didn't tell you the part
I didn't want to be true.

11:10.169 --> 11:12.254
Sally, I'm a piece of shit.
You gave me a life

11:12.254 --> 11:13.964
I don't fucking deserve.

11:15.800 --> 11:18.135
You were so loving to me

11:18.135 --> 11:20.763
and you made me feel...
(gasps)

11:21.597 --> 11:23.724
like a fucking human.

11:27.436 --> 11:30.689

Just you being Sally.

11:49.417 --> 11:52.545
Sally, that's beautiful.
Do you really feel
safe with me?

11:53.337 --> 11:54.964
Sally?

11:54.964 --> 11:58.008
Sally, do you feel safe with me?

11:58.008 --> 12:00.636
Do you mean that?
'Cause you are safe with me, Sally.

12:00.636 --> 12:03.514
You're always gonna
be safe with me.

12:03.514 --> 12:07.476
Sally, I love you.

12:07.476 --> 12:09.728
I love you. Sally!

12:09.728 --> 12:12.148
- (bangs on window)

12:12.148 --> 12:14.358
- I love you.
And you're always--
- (bangs on window)

12:14.358 --> 12:16.402
You're always safe with me!

12:17.695 --> 12:19.530
(door unlocks, opens)

12:19.530 --> 12:21.532
(buzzer)

12:21.532 --> 12:23.826
(door shuts, clicks)

12:34.420 --> 12:37.173
(clears throat)
Gene Cousineau?

12:37.173 --> 12:39.049
Holy shit,
you got here fast.

12:39.049 --> 12:40.092
You wanna go inside?

12:40.092 --> 12:41.886
What do you drive,
a rocket ship?

12:41.886 --> 12:43.512
Or should we go
someplace else?

12:45.097 --> 12:46.765
Were you followed?

12:47.641 --> 12:48.851
N-No.

12:48.851 --> 12:50.728
Okay. Listen.

12:51.687 --> 12:53.439
The address is in here.

12:54.523 --> 12:56.025
Once you get there,

12:56.025 --> 12:58.235
lock the door.

12:59.195 --> 13:00.529
Shit.

13:02.490 --> 13:06.035
(chatter, laughter)

13:06.035 --> 13:07.703
- Cristobal: Alright.
- (shushing)

13:07.703 --> 13:10.664
Cristobal:
Don't lie. You had some fun.

13:10.664 --> 13:12.249
Together.

13:12.249 --> 13:14.376
That's what this
is all about, man.

13:14.376 --> 13:17.129
So, why did we bring you here?

13:20.799 --> 13:23.052
It is because of this.

13:23.052 --> 13:25.429
But this is not what you
are thinking. (laughs) It is--

13:25.429 --> 13:27.765
- It's not heroin.
- Not heroin.

13:27.765 --> 13:29.183
This is sand.

13:29.183 --> 13:32.353
High-quality sand
is a hot commodity.

13:32.353 --> 13:35.356
Every construction company
needs it

13:35.356 --> 13:37.566
to make their foundation stronger,

13:37.566 --> 13:39.026
more resilient.

13:39.026 --> 13:42.238
First, we will corner
the market in California.

13:42.238 --> 13:45.533
- Then, the entire country.
- But, in order to do so,

13:45.533 --> 13:47.034
we need Bong's ports and trucks,

13:47.034 --> 13:48.744
and we need Manny and Jorge's
muscle to make sure

13:48.744 --> 13:50.704
the construction sites
are only using our stuff.

13:50.704 --> 13:52.915
Excuse me, we've got
this room for, like,
another hour, please!

13:52.915 --> 13:55.042
- Cristobal: Jesus.
- NoHo Hank: Thank you.

13:55.042 --> 13:57.920
Me and Hank will turn this
into legitimate enterprise.

13:57.920 --> 13:59.964
You'll soon be 9-to-5, assholes.

13:59.964 --> 14:02.091
It will grow in a way
that we can do business

14:02.091 --> 14:04.426
not in the shadows,
but in the light.

14:04.426 --> 14:07.471
- Call a tailor 'cause
y'all gonna need suits.
- (Cristobal laughs)

14:07.471 --> 14:10.766
We are going to turn
into solid citizens.

14:10.766 --> 14:12.476
It will give us a community,

14:12.476 --> 14:15.104
but most importantly...

14:15.104 --> 14:17.481
(clicks tongue)
it will make us rich.

14:17.481 --> 14:21.360
- (applause)
- (murmuring)

14:21.360 --> 14:24.530
I'd like to propose something
real quick to the fellas.

14:26.532 --> 14:29.827
When it comes to enforcing
and protecting said merch,

14:29.827 --> 14:32.913
sometimes, you need
that ace in the hole.

14:32.913 --> 14:36.250
Ours is top assassin
named Barry Berkman.

14:37.334 --> 14:39.086
Now, homie's in prison.

14:39.086 --> 14:40.796
But you know
what we're gonna do?

14:40.796 --> 14:44.758
We're going to break him out.
Prison break 2023!

14:45.759 --> 14:48.721
(chairs creaking)

14:48.721 --> 14:51.056
(hushed murmuring)

14:51.056 --> 14:53.601
(sighs)
Hank, what are you doing?

14:53.601 --> 14:58.480
Okay, Barry's Splash Brothers
of assassins. We need him.

14:58.480 --> 15:00.274
What are you saying?
What are you talking about?

15:00.274 --> 15:02.067
I looked at the prison online.

15:02.067 --> 15:03.444
It's super easy to break into.

15:03.444 --> 15:06.363
- (scoffs) Is this a yoke?
- No, this is not a yoke.

15:06.363 --> 15:08.616
- Cristobal: What you are
proposing is stupid.
- NoHo Hank: Okay, you're the one

15:08.616 --> 15:10.993
- who's talking about
fucking sand.
- You said you liked the sand.

15:10.993 --> 15:14.163
- (dialogue fades out)
- (wind fades in)

15:14.163 --> 15:16.540
(wind blowing)

15:16.540 --> 15:19.001
Young Barry (quietly):
Get over here. Get over here.

15:19.001 --> 15:21.795
(indistinct whispering)

15:21.795 --> 15:23.380
Young Barry:
Ah... Hey, get back here.

15:23.380 --> 15:27.092
Fuches:
Hey, bud. Remember me?
Your dad's friend?

15:27.092 --> 15:28.302
Yeah, he told me
to come out here,

15:28.302 --> 15:30.429
tell you it's, uh,
time for lunch.

15:30.429 --> 15:32.681
- Young Barry: Okay.
- Fuches: Okay.

15:32.681 --> 15:35.684
What you got there?
Is that a good guy or a bad guy?

15:35.684 --> 15:37.269
- Young Barry: Bad guy.
- Fuches: Bad guy.

15:37.269 --> 15:39.980
- Cool-ocity. Who fights him?
- (quiet rhythmic clapping)

15:39.980 --> 15:41.440
Young Barry:
Everyone but himself.

15:41.440 --> 15:42.816
- Fuches: Oh, okay.
- Young Barry: Yeah.

15:42.816 --> 15:44.568
Fuches:
And the, the yellow guy?
Is he fighting?

15:44.568 --> 15:45.819
- Young Barry: Yeah.
- Fuches: Yeah?

15:45.819 --> 15:47.696
Young Barry:
So, he kills the bronze,

15:47.696 --> 15:50.824
- winds his arm back,
and then, bling! Whoosh!
- (clapping grows louder)

15:50.824 --> 15:54.828
- And it pushes the other one,
and boom! Yeah.
- (Fuches laughs)

15:54.828 --> 15:58.040
Fuches:
That's cool. What about the guy
in white? What does he do?

15:58.040 --> 16:00.668
Young Barry:
So, he's supposed
to be camouflaged,

16:00.668 --> 16:03.128
but it's not snowing...

16:03.128 --> 16:06.465

- (clapping intensifies)

16:10.260 --> 16:13.180

16:13.180 --> 16:16.266

rhythmic clapping stop)

16:16.266 --> 16:19.395
- (applause)
- (big band music playing)

16:19.395 --> 16:22.356
(cheering echoes)

16:22.356 --> 16:25.609
- (sound fades out)

16:39.498 --> 16:43.168

16:47.506 --> 16:49.842

17:09.111 --> 17:10.487
(music ends)

17:12.531 --> 17:14.533
Sally:
Okay, look, I know...

17:14.533 --> 17:17.536
I accused you
of a lot of things

17:17.536 --> 17:18.912
that weren't technically true,

17:18.912 --> 17:21.582
so I understand you, personally,

17:21.582 --> 17:23.167
not wanting to work with me,

17:23.167 --> 17:25.502
but if you could just
recommend me

17:25.502 --> 17:27.296
to someone, anyone.

17:27.296 --> 17:30.132
Even a small boutique agency.

17:30.132 --> 17:33.093
I mean, I'll read for
Waitress Number Two.
I'll do--

17:33.093 --> 17:34.970
Do you read what people
are saying about you

17:34.970 --> 17:36.430
on social media?

17:36.930 --> 17:37.848
No.

17:39.725 --> 17:42.561
- Well, now it's going
to mainstream media.
- (beep, video playing)

17:42.561 --> 17:44.146
Reporter (on video):
<i>And coming up

<i>Turns out, her boyfriend was

17:51.695 --> 17:53.280
You need to understand
the gravity

17:53.280 --> 17:55.866
of what you're up against here.

17:55.866 --> 17:57.951
It's not just about
Natalie's video.

17:57.951 --> 17:59.703
You and Barry are linked.

17:59.703 --> 18:01.872
You're getting called out
for thanking him
at your premiere.

18:01.872 --> 18:03.832
People are grabbing images
of the two of you

18:03.832 --> 18:06.668
- off your Facebook.
- But I'm the victim here.

18:06.668 --> 18:09.338
You are no longer Sally Reed.

18:09.338 --> 18:11.298
You're the "Entitled Cunt Girl"

18:11.298 --> 18:13.258
who dated a serial killer.

18:14.510 --> 18:17.721
It's not like
your career is over.

18:17.721 --> 18:20.015
If you wanted,
you could have...

18:21.016 --> 18:23.644
a reality show or...

18:24.728 --> 18:26.897
a podcast.

18:26.897 --> 18:29.441
And you would make
more money than God.

18:32.069 --> 18:34.238
You have two high-profile
strikes against you,

18:34.238 --> 18:36.573
and, on top of that,

18:36.573 --> 18:38.784
you have integrity.

18:39.493 --> 18:41.495
I'm so sorry.

19:25.873 --> 19:27.624
The only reason
I brought you here

19:27.624 --> 19:30.836
is because I just can't
have more attention.

19:30.836 --> 19:33.172
I can't be in the spotlight.

19:34.339 --> 19:37.050

Mister! Mister, please!

I need to be in the theater!
Don't close the theater!

20:06.705 --> 20:08.081
(normal voice)
Hey, I am so sorry,

20:08.081 --> 20:10.959
but my class is the most
sought after in this city.

20:10.959 --> 20:14.296
It's-- It's full.
Just scram.

20:14.296 --> 20:18.175
(deep voice)
No! I-I-I need to be
in that theater!

20:18.175 --> 20:19.801
You know, I just came
back from the war.

20:19.801 --> 20:21.637
It did somethin' terrible to me.

20:21.637 --> 20:23.639
Yeah, a-and the word
on the street is

20:23.639 --> 20:25.682
you don't just teach acting.

20:25.682 --> 20:27.935
You save lives!

20:27.935 --> 20:29.478
If I don't get
into that theater,

20:29.478 --> 20:32.314
I'm gonna go home,
and kablam!

20:33.857 --> 20:36.276
(normal voice)
Not on my watch, son.

20:36.276 --> 20:38.820
Not on my watch.

20:38.820 --> 20:43.784
And that was the first day
that I met Barry Berkman.

20:43.784 --> 20:46.620
Now, he came to me
like most of my students.

20:46.620 --> 20:49.373
He was eager.
He was dumb.

20:49.373 --> 20:51.500
So, what did I do?

20:51.500 --> 20:54.378
I got into his brain
and I set up shop.

20:54.378 --> 20:56.546
And pretty soon...

20:56.546 --> 20:59.007
he opened like a flower.

20:59.967 --> 21:01.468
And then one day,

21:01.468 --> 21:03.595
like Siegfried...

21:03.595 --> 21:05.138
or Roy...

21:06.264 --> 21:07.516
he turned on me,

21:07.516 --> 21:10.894
like an ungrateful tiger.

21:10.894 --> 21:14.064
(long sigh)

21:19.027 --> 21:20.487
So you handle a lot
of cases like this?

21:20.487 --> 21:23.198
- Is this an audition?
I don't do auditions.
- Fuches: No, no.

21:23.198 --> 21:26.576
- Everyone knows
you're one of the best.
- Gale Winograde: Yeah.

21:26.576 --> 21:28.787
Fucking ask me to audition.

21:30.122 --> 21:33.417
I don't know whether
Cousineau wore a wire or not,

21:33.417 --> 21:36.336
but if he did,
they have Barry on there

21:36.336 --> 21:38.255
saying he killed Janice Moss.

21:38.255 --> 21:39.673
I have an audio engineer.

21:39.673 --> 21:41.174
I bring him up
in front of the jury.

21:41.174 --> 21:44.511
He records me saying bullshit,
like, "How much is this mop?

21:44.511 --> 21:47.139
Why is my hot dog wet?"
Ring Around the Rosie nonsense.

21:47.139 --> 21:49.558
And then he cuts it up,
mixes it live, he plays it back,

21:49.558 --> 21:51.685
and it comes out as me
saying incriminating shit

21:51.685 --> 21:53.270
my client supposedly said.

21:53.270 --> 21:56.857
"I killed X guy on Y day."
Whatever.

21:56.857 --> 22:00.110
- Cool.
- Gale: Yeah. I also had
this other asshole.

22:00.110 --> 22:01.653
He said he shot somebody
outside of a club.

22:01.653 --> 22:04.197
They had him on video.
I said it was deepfaked.

22:04.197 --> 22:07.701
So, I had my nerd
put my face on the shooter,
and then I said,

22:07.701 --> 22:10.037
"Oh, no. Looks like I did it,"
you know? And then,

22:10.037 --> 22:12.497
I put my hands behind my back
like I was gettin' cuffed.

22:12.497 --> 22:14.875
Fuckin' jury laughed so hard.

22:14.875 --> 22:16.793
I killed it that day.

22:18.003 --> 22:19.171
Was he the shooter?

22:20.714 --> 22:22.507
Sure.

22:22.507 --> 22:25.302
So, where the hell
is Berkman, huh?

22:28.180 --> 22:30.223
You killed a cop.
Why should you get a deal?

22:30.223 --> 22:31.808
I got a lot to offer.

22:31.808 --> 22:33.435
- We don't want Fuches.
- Is he still mad at me?

22:33.435 --> 22:35.604
We need the other
jobs you pulled.
