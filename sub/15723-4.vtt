00:01.960 --> 00:04.171
...possibility of
our miraculous cloning of Jesus.

00:04.296 --> 00:06.089
What do you know about this Walsh guy?

00:06.089 --> 00:07.466
I didn't make a mistake David.

00:07.591 --> 00:09.760
Okay, don't lose it on me, Bob. Do you
have any idea what you're saying here.

00:09.885 --> 00:11.386
And the return of Christ
is only the beginning.

00:11.386 --> 00:13.180
- Is Hira on it?
- She's been locked out.

00:13.180 --> 00:14.264
Do you know Hira has a brother

00:14.389 --> 00:15.974
who's a member of a terrorist
cell in Pakistan?

00:16.099 --> 00:17.768
I want her back.

00:17.893 --> 00:20.062
So do I, when I'm satisfied
she works for us.

00:20.187 --> 00:21.563
Have you ever heard of
a Dr. Shelby Sloan?

00:21.563 --> 00:22.397
That's your father?

00:22.481 --> 00:25.484
You have no idea
what I was capable of 15 years ago.

00:25.484 --> 00:26.360
Well, Mick does.

00:26.360 --> 00:29.196
We are entering a great new
age of enlightenment.

00:29.279 --> 00:31.573
I was approached by the
Pakistani military.

00:31.573 --> 00:34.576
While the rest of you were imaging
the impossible, I was doing it!

00:34.660 --> 00:37.371
Best defence:
mutually assured destruction.

00:37.496 --> 00:39.665
Your dad's got to believe me
now! I mean, he'll want a study.

00:39.790 --> 00:43.961
The truth is, I created one son
to save another.

00:43.961 --> 00:45.963
Blood from which we have
cloned the Christ child.

00:46.088 --> 00:47.965
- Shit!
- David, let's just go in the back.

00:48.090 --> 00:50.884
- Oh, no, no, no.
- ...have been genetically broken down by 4--

00:50.884 --> 00:51.885
No, no!

1x04- Prions

02:54.967 --> 02:58.095
I've never been
to a Muslim funeral before.

02:58.262 --> 03:00.472
Weird how it's just men, huh?

03:01.265 --> 03:04.184
Bob, you don't have to
stand here with me.

03:04.476 --> 03:06.562
I don't mind.
I'll just go over afterward...

03:12.484 --> 03:14.570
and say something to the family.

03:34.965 --> 03:36.967
I'll see you back at the lab.

04:02.576 --> 04:04.369
Mr. Khan.

04:08.999 --> 04:10.167
I...

04:12.169 --> 04:15.088
I don't know why this happened.

04:17.882 --> 04:19.301
I'm sorry.

04:19.885 --> 04:21.386
My daughter was proud.

04:21.678 --> 04:24.473
You made her feel ashamed!

04:24.765 --> 04:26.099
You!

04:26.600 --> 04:27.768
You...

04:41.573 --> 04:44.201
Although the outbreak
was contained,

04:44.201 --> 04:47.162
the terrorists behind the camel
pox/Ebola epidemic are

04:47.287 --> 04:49.373
still at large and
should be considered

04:49.373 --> 04:54.002
an ongoing threat
to worldwide security.

04:54.086 --> 04:56.964
NorBAC will continue its research
in an effort to

04:56.964 --> 05:01.969
neutralize any further threat
the Miranda virus may pose to the global community.

05:01.969 --> 05:04.972
Though NorBAC was not conceived
as a law enforcement agency,

05:04.972 --> 05:07.266
we will continue to assist
authorities

05:07.391 --> 05:11.270
in their investigation of the person
or persons behind the virus,

05:11.270 --> 05:13.689
as well as provide
any information we can

05:13.772 --> 05:16.900
into the shooting death of Dr. Hira Kahn

05:16.900 --> 05:19.862
which at this time appears to be
the act of a lone gunman.

05:19.987 --> 05:23.365
Ladies and gentlemen,
on a personal note.

05:23.365 --> 05:26.869
I think I speak for everyone
at the NorBAC lab

05:26.869 --> 05:28.078
when I say that

05:28.161 --> 05:31.582
Dr. Kahn will be sorely missed.

06:55.290 --> 06:56.875
So, how was it? How did it go?

06:57.000 --> 06:58.085
What?

06:59.670 --> 07:01.088
The funeral.

07:10.597 --> 07:13.767
I don't feel like listening
to music right now.

07:18.188 --> 07:20.691
So, were you and Hira
tight, or...?

07:21.191 --> 07:24.695
How long did you
know her for?

07:28.991 --> 07:33.370
Yeah, you do know that school's
the other way, right dad?

07:37.291 --> 07:39.501
It's fine with me, I mean
I have to register.

07:39.585 --> 07:41.295
I can register
next year.

07:41.378 --> 07:43.463
I'll take you to school after
we stop by the lab, all right?

07:45.591 --> 07:47.092
Okay. Fine.

07:59.897 --> 08:02.191
Why is British intelligence
getting involved?

08:02.482 --> 08:05.194
I don't know. An agent Digby
wants you to get back to him though.

08:05.485 --> 08:07.487
- Collin Digby?
- You know him?

08:07.779 --> 08:09.990
We've worked together before.
What about him?

08:10.199 --> 08:12.784
He's going to be in town
tomorrow. I'll set up a meeting.

08:13.076 --> 08:14.494
Okay, what about the shooter?

08:14.578 --> 08:16.496
He's still uncooperative.
He's not talking.

08:16.788 --> 08:18.999
Uh, the report says that
he's suicidal,

08:19.291 --> 08:22.085
detached and signs
of delusional psychosis.

08:22.377 --> 08:23.295
Okay, anything else?

08:24.087 --> 08:26.590
Hira's replacement. Are you
still interested in Jill Langston?

08:26.965 --> 08:28.967
- Absolutely.
- Her background check cleared.

08:29.885 --> 08:31.386
What do you want me to
do about David?

08:31.470 --> 08:33.179
For now let's just get
her on his radar.

08:33.263 --> 08:35.682
Set up something informal. Maybe
in Chicago when he's there next week.

08:36.183 --> 08:37.768
- Will do.
- Is that it?

08:38.268 --> 08:39.895
We've got a situation
developing in the States

08:40.187 --> 08:42.272
related to a prion
type disease.

08:42.481 --> 08:43.565
- Prion?
- Mad cow.

08:44.274 --> 08:45.400
How bad is it?

08:46.193 --> 08:48.779
I don't know for sure, but I'm going
to get an update this afternoon.

08:48.904 --> 08:51.198
Okay, brief David on
everything you've got.

08:51.281 --> 08:53.367
Right. Are you on a flight
this afternoon?

08:53.492 --> 08:55.702
Sounds like I'd better be.

08:55.786 --> 08:58.872
- I'll see you when you get here.
- Okay. Thanks, Wes.

09:21.770 --> 09:24.064
Just wait in the car.
I'll only be 5 minutes.

09:24.273 --> 09:25.774
I don't want to wait in the car.

09:28.569 --> 09:32.364
You know, when the police called
and told me you were shot,

09:32.364 --> 09:36.201
I called mom and
she asked me if it was in a bar.

09:37.578 --> 09:41.498
That's because that's where
your mother generally shoots people.

09:42.875 --> 09:44.793
Is that where
it happened?

09:45.586 --> 09:47.004
Dr. Sandstrom?

09:47.588 --> 09:48.881
Excuse me, Dr. Sandstrom.

09:49.173 --> 09:51.884
- I know this is hard for you.
- Don't make it any harder.

09:51.967 --> 09:53.594
Those people who gathered here
the other day

09:53.677 --> 09:55.596
were devout believers
in what we've accomplished.

09:55.679 --> 09:57.764
- Even the guy with the gun?
- No, of course not.

09:57.890 --> 10:00.392
- Goodbye, Reverend.
- Dr. Sandstrom, please.

10:00.475 --> 10:04.104
You hold in your grasp the acknowledgement
that Jesus will soon be reborn.

10:04.271 --> 10:04.897
Go.

10:04.980 --> 10:08.483
Your accreditation means a great deal
to all of us involved in this project.

10:08.567 --> 10:10.402
Really, what's a great deal?

10:10.485 --> 10:14.990
I think an honorarium wouldn't be
out of the question given the importance.

10:15.073 --> 10:17.492
Now, you're not trying
to buy my opinion, are you?

10:17.492 --> 10:19.870
No, of course not.
I want the truth, Dr. Sandstrom.

10:19.870 --> 10:21.705
Oh, I can make myself believe.

10:23.665 --> 10:25.584
A top scientist like you,

10:25.667 --> 10:30.172
I'm sure you'd command a substantial
compensation for your services.

10:30.297 --> 10:31.798
Say...

10:31.798 --> 10:33.800
$100,000.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.802
Wow, that much for
the truth, huh?

10:35.802 --> 10:37.304
Well, I think that's fair.

10:37.679 --> 10:39.681
I guess everyone's got their
price, eh, Walsh?

10:39.890 --> 10:40.599
Apparently.

10:43.185 --> 10:44.102
Asshole.

10:45.479 --> 10:47.272
Jesus Christ.

10:48.899 --> 10:49.775
You hit him!

10:49.983 --> 10:51.693
Did I? Go wait up in my office.

10:51.777 --> 10:53.570
- I can't believe you!
- Upstairs!

11:12.506 --> 11:14.091
Can I help?

11:14.800 --> 11:18.095
Do I look like I need any help?
What do you want, Wes?

11:18.303 --> 11:20.097
I have a report for you from the CDC.

11:20.305 --> 11:21.098
God.

11:22.266 --> 11:23.475
5 minutes, Lilith.

11:27.479 --> 11:29.398
What's that?

11:30.274 --> 11:31.567
Oh, Hira's stuff.

11:31.692 --> 11:34.403
Make sure it gets back to her
family, would you?

11:34.570 --> 11:36.488
- David, about this report.
- Ah, yes,

11:36.572 --> 11:40.200
We have 4 victims
of an advanced prion type disease.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.077
That sounds interesting. What
do you think, Mayko?

11:42.202 --> 11:43.370
What?

11:43.370 --> 11:46.582
Oh yeah, I guess
we should just get back to work, huh?

11:46.665 --> 11:49.793
Caroline wanted me
to brief you.

11:50.169 --> 11:52.296
I'm briefed. It's bullshit.

11:52.379 --> 11:53.505
I'm sorry?

11:53.672 --> 11:57.467
Page 1: a 5 year old kid
with prion disease?

11:57.968 --> 11:58.969
What?

12:00.179 --> 12:03.265
It takes at least 7 years
for a prion protein to fuck up the brain

12:03.390 --> 12:06.685
and then at least another year
after that before you die.

12:08.103 --> 12:08.687
Where are you going?

12:08.896 --> 12:11.773
Does everything around here
have to be about work?!

12:12.566 --> 12:13.984
What would you like it to be about?

12:14.067 --> 12:15.694
Hira's dead, David!

12:15.903 --> 12:18.697
Yeah, she's dead. Got it. Got
it.

12:19.198 --> 12:21.200
Wes, you got it don't you?

12:21.575 --> 12:22.868
Yeah, Wes has got it.

12:23.076 --> 12:24.203
Wes has got it, I
got it, even

12:24.369 --> 12:26.496
her family's got it.
They know just who to blame too.

12:26.580 --> 12:28.290
- Stop it.
- Stop what?

12:28.290 --> 12:29.082
Life?

12:29.791 --> 12:33.170
Hira took a bullet, that's it,
game over, we move on.

12:34.588 --> 12:36.006
I've got to get out of here.

12:40.469 --> 12:43.180
Caroline also wanted me
to set up a meeting

12:43.388 --> 12:45.098
with you and a replacement
for Hira.

12:45.599 --> 12:47.267
- I'll get back to that later.
- Good idea, Wes.

12:47.768 --> 12:49.478
Lilith, let's go.

12:49.770 --> 12:50.687
Thanks.

12:54.066 --> 12:54.900
You hit him!

12:55.192 --> 12:56.693
Did I? Wait upstairs
in my office.

12:56.902 --> 12:58.278
- I can't believe you!
- Upstairs!

13:01.782 --> 13:03.700
Hello, Lilith.

13:03.700 --> 13:05.577
I'm Bob Melnikov.
Remember me?

13:05.994 --> 13:08.080
- I did some tests on Mick.
- Hi.

13:08.580 --> 13:10.082
I wanted to say that I'm sorry

13:10.207 --> 13:12.501
we couldn't come up with something
to help Mick.

13:12.584 --> 13:13.669
He's a nice boy.

13:14.169 --> 13:15.003
Yeah.

13:15.379 --> 13:18.298
Yeah, I thought we might have
had a chance using gene therapy.

13:18.674 --> 13:20.175
What do you mean, might
have had a chance?

13:20.592 --> 13:23.595
- No, we still do, just not in--
- 5 minutes Lilith.

13:25.973 --> 13:28.475
I started doing the analysis
of snips in Mick's genome

13:28.767 --> 13:30.686
and found so many rare polymorphisms.

13:30.894 --> 13:33.480
We just need to find the genes
that are making him sick.

13:33.772 --> 13:35.691
I thought we had found something
on chromosome 19,

13:35.983 --> 13:37.276
but then when I looked closer,

13:37.568 --> 13:40.404
lots of healthy people have that gene too,
so that was a dead end,

13:40.696 --> 13:42.489
but I'm not discouraged.

13:42.781 --> 13:45.576
Good... Then you could
still find something?

13:45.784 --> 13:47.786
Oh, sure. We'll keep looking.

13:47.995 --> 13:50.205
He doesn't have a whole lot of time left.

13:50.205 --> 13:52.791
- I know.
- Lilith, let's go.

13:54.084 --> 13:55.294
Thanks.

14:14.188 --> 14:16.273
You're pushing it
pretty hard out there.

14:16.773 --> 14:18.901
Yeah.

14:18.984 --> 14:21.069
You in training or something?

14:21.195 --> 14:22.571
No.

14:22.696 --> 14:25.407
Just keeping the cardiovascular
in shape.

14:27.576 --> 14:30.787
You must be pretty serious
if you're out in weather like this.

14:30.787 --> 14:32.372
Yeah.

14:33.373 --> 14:35.584
So, what do you do when
you're not running?

14:35.792 --> 14:38.003
- I work at a lab.
- Ah, a scientist.

14:38.587 --> 14:40.797
- What kind of scientist?
- Would you...

14:41.006 --> 14:45.469
If you ask me, you scientists
are getting a little out of control.

14:45.677 --> 14:47.971
Well, I guess I'm not asking.

14:48.096 --> 14:50.307
Like, I heard they grew
this whole person in a jar

14:50.682 --> 14:54.269
in some Korean laboratory.
I mean, what's that about?

14:54.269 --> 14:57.189
I don't know. I don't do that.

14:57.272 --> 14:59.608
Well, what do you do?

14:59.608 --> 15:01.777
I try to make
the world a little better, okay?

15:01.902 --> 15:04.196
That's what I do.

15:04.279 --> 15:07.282
Making the world fucking better.
Fucking scientists!

15:13.372 --> 15:15.290
Okay, great, school.

15:19.795 --> 15:21.088
Where are you going?

15:21.672 --> 15:23.173
Don't you want me to come in with you?

15:23.382 --> 15:24.007
No.

15:24.299 --> 15:25.175
It's you first day.

15:25.384 --> 15:27.594
Just go back to your lab, dad.

15:28.804 --> 15:29.888
Okay, well.

15:30.180 --> 15:32.182
You know, if you need me, just...

15:33.600 --> 15:34.476
Yeah.

15:41.108 --> 15:42.484
Spongiform encephalopathy,

15:42.901 --> 15:45.988
it's a brain wasting disease
originally know as Kuru-Kuru.

15:46.280 --> 15:49.408
It was passed from human to human
by cannibals in Papua New Guinea.

15:49.700 --> 15:50.701
- You're kidding.
- Not at all.

15:50.868 --> 15:52.703
The women and children honoured
their deceased ancestors by ritually

15:52.995 --> 15:55.789
eating their brains, therefore passing
the disease

15:56.081 --> 15:57.499
on from generation to generation.

15:57.791 --> 16:00.502
- I'm glad I'm not a cannibal.
- Oh, you can still get it,

16:00.794 --> 16:03.797
from infected meat, scrapie in
sheep, mad cow in cattle.

16:04.089 --> 16:06.091
It's very effective at crossing species.

16:06.383 --> 16:08.594
- Any more good news?
- I don't think that's good news.

16:08.677 --> 16:09.803
Thanks, Bob. I've got to get back to it.

16:09.803 --> 16:12.306
Since 1990 when mad cow entered
the human food chain,

16:12.306 --> 16:13.599
20 people have died.

16:14.099 --> 16:15.767
Who knows how many more
are infected,

16:16.101 --> 16:18.395
having their brains slowly wasted.

16:22.191 --> 16:25.194
Oh man, they wanted
transcripts and proof of where I lived,

16:25.402 --> 16:26.695
and photo I.D., and all this...

16:26.904 --> 16:29.198
So, did you have all that stuff though?

16:29.406 --> 16:30.574
No, of course not.

16:30.782 --> 16:33.785
Well, then aren't you going to
go back there and to talk to them or...?

16:34.077 --> 16:35.787
No way, I am totally
out of there.

16:36.079 --> 16:37.789
You're going to have to
do it at some point.

16:37.998 --> 16:40.375
Yeah, I don't...
I really don't care, Mick.

16:41.001 --> 16:43.879
So, are you okay, or...?
What's up?

16:44.505 --> 16:47.883
Uh, nothing much. I just got
back from the hospital.

16:48.175 --> 16:49.176
Oh, yeah?

16:49.885 --> 16:52.804
How often do you have to
get tested and stuff?

16:52.971 --> 16:55.098
Every couple of weeks and
it's no big deal.

16:55.307 --> 16:56.600
So, how's your dad doing?

16:56.975 --> 16:59.478
- He's all right. We talked.
- Yeah.

17:00.187 --> 17:02.898
I've never seen him
cry before.

17:03.690 --> 17:05.400
So, what are you going to
do about school?

17:05.692 --> 17:07.486
I don't know.
Life's too short.

17:08.069 --> 17:10.489
Yeah, kinda know.

17:13.282 --> 17:17.704
Oh, I was at my dad's lab
today and I was talking to this

17:18.288 --> 17:22.000
Bob guy and he was explaining to
me this idea he had to help you.

17:30.092 --> 17:31.301
It's okay.

17:34.888 --> 17:35.597
Hi.

17:36.598 --> 17:37.307
Hi

17:51.280 --> 17:53.574
My dad's going to find
something, Mick.

17:54.783 --> 17:56.201
It's okay. I'm serious.

17:57.870 --> 17:58.871
It's okay.

19:20.702 --> 19:25.207
David, I think I got one.
It looks like an old human strain.

19:25.582 --> 19:27.584
Take a look at
the sequence over here. And this.

19:27.709 --> 19:29.795
Oh shit, do you think this could be
a piece of the Spanish lady?

19:29.878 --> 19:30.671
It is, David.

19:33.298 --> 19:34.174
You want to...?

19:34.174 --> 19:35.384
Not really.

19:35.676 --> 19:37.010
Yes, you do.

19:41.807 --> 19:44.309
Come on, dump it. Dump it.

19:45.894 --> 19:47.396
No. Oh, Jesus.

19:48.605 --> 19:50.274
Finally, icing.

19:50.983 --> 19:53.777
You know, you're going to have
to explain icing to me again, David.

19:59.283 --> 20:00.492
You okay?

20:00.993 --> 20:02.077
I'm fine.

20:05.497 --> 20:07.207
You know, I was thinking.

20:10.502 --> 20:12.796
When you're lying in your casket

20:13.005 --> 20:15.174
with your family and friends
standing over you,

20:15.674 --> 20:18.093
what would you like to hear
them say about you?

20:18.385 --> 20:19.303
I don't know.

20:19.678 --> 20:21.680
Maybe I'd like to hear them say that

20:21.972 --> 20:25.184
I was a great doctor or a fine son.

20:26.977 --> 20:30.606
No, I know exactly what I'd like
to hear them say.

20:30.898 --> 20:32.274
And what's that?

20:32.608 --> 20:34.985
Look, he's moving.

20:37.487 --> 20:38.780
Goodnight.

20:39.072 --> 20:40.199
You going to bed already?

20:40.574 --> 20:41.700
Yeah, I am. I'm kind of tired.

20:41.783 --> 20:43.994
Did you get everything
all squared away with school?

20:44.077 --> 20:45.787
Shoot! Aw, shoot hit.

20:46.288 --> 20:47.789
- Hmmph! Good night.
- Good night.

20:47.998 --> 20:49.374
Huh?

20:58.383 --> 21:01.595
Do you know Hira's father
spit on me today.

21:01.887 --> 21:03.680
Bob told me.

21:08.185 --> 21:11.396
I don't know. Maybe I deserved it, eh?

21:12.397 --> 21:14.691
I'm the one who dragged her
back to the lab

21:15.108 --> 21:17.694
and pulled her into
that crowd of people.

21:17.986 --> 21:19.488
Don't even go there, David.

21:19.696 --> 21:22.407
Why not? It's what happened.

21:22.699 --> 21:23.909
Right?

21:28.872 --> 21:30.874
It's what happened.

21:41.301 --> 21:42.678
What?

21:44.805 --> 21:46.390
Jesus.

22:07.578 --> 22:09.788
Hey, slugger.

22:10.080 --> 22:13.792
- It's good chicken.
- You like that? It's Carlos' recipe.

22:14.710 --> 22:18.005
You soak the chicken in tequila,

22:18.297 --> 22:21.008
then you throw it on the barbeque, and

22:21.592 --> 22:25.012
then you forget about the chicken
and you drink the tequila.

22:25.304 --> 22:26.680
It's nice.

22:26.889 --> 22:28.974
Shouldn't you be getting
ready for school?

22:29.099 --> 22:31.393
Uh, I can't till I register.

22:31.602 --> 22:33.187
I thought that's
what you were doing yesterday.

22:33.312 --> 22:34.897
To just register, dad, you need

22:35.189 --> 22:38.400
transcripts and photo I.D.,
anyways, I'm handling it.

22:38.984 --> 22:39.902
Good.

22:44.698 --> 22:46.074
What's this?

22:46.700 --> 22:48.785
Oh, that guy called you.

22:49.494 --> 22:51.288
He wants to talk to you
or something.

22:51.997 --> 22:54.291
- Danny Dexter.
- Yeah, who is he?

22:55.209 --> 22:58.295
Uh, he's this guy I used to
kick around with in high school.

22:58.295 --> 23:01.089
He's a hockey player now.

23:02.883 --> 23:05.302
What are you doing about school again?

23:05.677 --> 23:08.180
Victim #2: Maurice White, 52,

23:08.388 --> 23:11.808
San Antonio, Texas, geriatric trainer.

23:12.184 --> 23:14.186
Martin Crutchfield, 72 years old.

23:14.603 --> 23:17.898
Santa Barbara, California,
retired lawyer.

23:18.190 --> 23:21.610
Last weekend he drove his car
through an open market,

23:21.610 --> 23:24.905
killing 6 people,
injuring 17, 2 critically.

23:26.073 --> 23:29.701
He had no idea what he'd done.
Total loss of memory.

23:30.285 --> 23:31.578
He died yesterday.

23:32.287 --> 23:35.374
And finally, Sarah McKinley,
Tampa Florida,

23:36.208 --> 23:37.292
5 years old.

23:45.092 --> 23:46.885
- You got the pathology?
- I do.

23:48.303 --> 23:49.805
You're not hungover?

23:49.972 --> 23:51.098
No, I'm not.

23:52.599 --> 23:55.102
Normal on your right,
infected on the left.

23:55.477 --> 23:57.896
Coroners pathology confirms
brain deterioration

23:58.105 --> 24:00.691
consistent with
some kind of prion disease.

24:00.899 --> 24:03.777
You got any idea how a 5 year old brain
ended up full of holes?

24:04.111 --> 24:06.572
Prions don't work that fast.
- Prions?

24:06.989 --> 24:11.285
You see, we all have these proteins in
our brains called prions. Millions of them.

24:11.285 --> 24:14.288
They're so small you can't even
see them under a microscope,

24:14.496 --> 24:17.708
and most of the time they're
just sitting around behaving themselves.

24:18.000 --> 24:19.877
But once in a blue, blue, blue moon,

24:20.002 --> 24:21.795
one of them goes bad.

24:21.879 --> 24:24.506
It's kind of like Dr. Jekyll
turning into Mr. Hyde.

24:24.673 --> 24:26.884
And then Mr. Hyde bumps into
another Dr. Jekyll

24:27.176 --> 24:29.178
and turns
him into another Hyde and

24:29.595 --> 24:32.890
they tell two friends,
and so on, and so on and so on,

24:33.182 --> 24:35.684
and eventually you've got all
these hungry little Hydes

24:35.976 --> 24:39.313
going to work eating holes
in your brain.

24:39.688 --> 24:42.900
- But not this fast.
- How fast?

24:43.192 --> 24:47.988
It would take a brain 7 maybe 8 years
to get in this condition.

24:48.280 --> 24:50.199
All victims died within a week

24:50.407 --> 24:51.992
of showing symptoms.

24:52.284 --> 24:54.077
Okay, so it's not behaving
like it should.

24:54.286 --> 24:56.205
It's infecting people who are too young,

24:56.413 --> 24:58.290
and it's shutting
down the brain too fast.

24:58.498 --> 25:02.211
It could be a virulent form
of the disease we haven't seen before.

25:02.294 --> 25:05.506
This prion disease, mad cow,
whatever you want to call it.

25:05.881 --> 25:08.884
- There's no test for it, is there?
- Not until you're dead.

25:09.176 --> 25:11.011
- And no cure.
- No.

25:12.179 --> 25:14.681
So, how are they getting it?
How are they getting it?

25:14.806 --> 25:16.975
There has to be a common link.

25:16.975 --> 25:19.478
We need to know
everything these people had to eat,

25:19.811 --> 25:21.104
whether they crossed paths,

25:21.313 --> 25:22.898
whether they were in the same
place at the same time.

25:23.106 --> 25:26.401
- I'm on it.
- We need to know everything about them,

25:26.610 --> 25:29.279
right down to the last protein.

25:30.781 --> 25:31.990
That was a joke.

25:32.282 --> 25:34.701
Get Bob on the brain tissue as
soon as it gets here.

25:34.993 --> 25:37.079
I want to run a mass spec
on the prion fraction.

25:37.412 --> 25:40.082
- Tell him to look for mad cow.
- Mad cow on steroids.

25:40.374 --> 25:42.876
Yeah, and double check the coroner's
pathology and made sure he got it right.

25:43.210 --> 25:44.586
I'll do my own pathology.

25:44.795 --> 25:46.505
I'm going to need access
to that little girl.

25:46.713 --> 25:48.674
- I'll arrange it.
- Where's Mayko?

25:49.007 --> 25:51.677
She wasn't feeling well.
I told her to stay home.

25:51.885 --> 25:53.387
Oh, bullshit. Get her ass in here,

25:53.595 --> 25:54.680
start sequencing the victim's DNA.

25:54.888 --> 25:56.682
Tell her to start looking
at their prion genes,

25:56.890 --> 25:58.600
anything they might have in common.

25:58.809 --> 26:00.477
- Where are you going?
- Lunch.

26:05.774 --> 26:08.485
I see you still have the touch.

26:08.902 --> 26:09.778
David!

26:10.904 --> 26:12.406
How are you?

26:14.408 --> 26:16.785
I'm great, really great.
Better than you, apparently.

26:16.994 --> 26:18.495
I can't believe I'm looking at you.

26:18.787 --> 26:21.498
Yeah. Check it out, I
dropped 11 lbs, touch that!

26:21.790 --> 26:23.208
BMI's 25.3.

26:23.375 --> 26:26.503
- White production up?
- Yes, not a rookie can touch me.

26:26.795 --> 26:29.506
Double cheese, rare, right?

26:29.673 --> 26:32.009
Oh, yeah, you know.

26:32.176 --> 26:33.177
Fuck it.

26:33.802 --> 26:35.512
So, Danny, what're you
doing in town?

26:35.804 --> 26:38.307
Well, David, I'll tell you.

26:40.893 --> 26:43.395
Big boys want to huddle.

26:44.479 --> 26:45.606
No way.

26:46.273 --> 26:49.693
Yeah, little Danny Dexter's
moving up.

26:52.279 --> 26:53.906
Hmm. Lilith moved in.

26:54.281 --> 26:55.991
Wow, what is she? Like 14?

26:56.283 --> 26:59.494
- Fifteen.
- Ooh, tons of attitude.

26:59.703 --> 27:01.496
- Just like the old man.
- Yeah, thanks.

27:03.498 --> 27:04.208
All right.

27:09.004 --> 27:10.297
See the game
the other night?

27:10.506 --> 27:12.508
Yeah, when Biriliski went
through the boards there.

27:12.799 --> 27:14.176
What was that all about?

27:14.676 --> 27:17.179
You didn't hear?
He's dead, David.

27:17.304 --> 27:18.514
Fuck off!

27:19.097 --> 27:20.098
Heart attack.

27:21.475 --> 27:22.809
Holy shit.

27:24.978 --> 27:26.396
How old was the guy?

27:26.980 --> 27:28.899
Three years younger than me,

27:29.191 --> 27:31.902
perfect health,
playing better than ever.

27:32.194 --> 27:34.279
- Jesus.
- Yeah, they think it's...

27:34.488 --> 27:36.406
- What? Steroids?
- No, some kind of...

27:37.074 --> 27:39.576
What do you call it?
One of those hormones

27:39.910 --> 27:41.495
that they can't test you for.

27:41.703 --> 27:44.915
The designer slops.
It's tough to find something like

27:45.082 --> 27:47.209
that if you don't know what
you're looking for.

27:47.209 --> 27:49.211
Yeah, but it beats pumping
'roids, right?

27:49.294 --> 27:52.798
- Oh, yeah. Who told you that?
- I don't know. I heard it.

27:53.006 --> 27:55.300
Why, do you think that shit's dangerous?

27:55.592 --> 27:58.178
I don't think, I know.

27:58.595 --> 28:00.013
Oh, man. You're not...

28:00.180 --> 28:02.599
No! I couldn't afford it.

28:05.185 --> 28:08.397
Besides, do I look like
a fucking idiot?

28:08.897 --> 28:10.107
Yeah.

28:11.400 --> 28:12.484
Fuck you.

28:12.693 --> 28:14.903
Eight ball, corner pocket.

29:05.495 --> 29:07.497
It's really amazing, isn't it?

29:07.706 --> 29:11.084
Something a billionth of our size
can get into us and kill us in a week.

29:11.293 --> 29:13.295
Do you remember
"War of the Worlds"?

29:13.504 --> 29:15.005
I love that movie.

29:15.088 --> 29:17.508
Those space guys thought
they had our planet.

29:17.591 --> 29:18.592
Shut up, Bob.

29:19.301 --> 29:23.514
What got them in the end was
a little, tiny earthly virus.

29:23.805 --> 29:24.806
Just shut up!

29:27.476 --> 29:28.685
I'll clean that up.

29:28.977 --> 29:32.105
Just leave it, okay! I don't want
to talk about the goddamn movie.

29:32.314 --> 29:34.274
- Sure.
- I'll have the numbers in a half hour.

29:35.108 --> 29:35.984
Thank you.

29:36.401 --> 29:38.111
Is everything okay?

29:38.278 --> 29:41.782
She's just a little tense,
I think. She'll be fine.

29:43.283 --> 29:45.577
It's a little early for this, Bob.

29:46.286 --> 29:48.080
No, I mean, yes.

29:48.914 --> 29:50.999
I mean... David wants me
to run a DNA sample.

29:51.208 --> 29:54.086
It's okay, Bob.
We all have those days.

30:41.508 --> 30:43.093
Are you...

30:43.677 --> 30:47.181
Are you the one who did the new
autopsy on my baby?

30:47.681 --> 30:49.391
Yes, I'm Dr. Carlos Serrano.

30:50.601 --> 30:53.103
I'm very sorry about
your daughter.

30:53.604 --> 30:55.480
Uh, do you know anything yet?

30:55.606 --> 30:57.107
Can you tell me anything?

30:57.316 --> 31:01.278
I'm sorry, no. We'll need
to do extensive tests.

31:01.695 --> 31:02.613
Of course.

31:04.114 --> 31:08.285
Sarah was my only child.

31:08.493 --> 31:09.494
Please.

31:13.207 --> 31:15.501
The doctors, they said
this thing comes

31:15.709 --> 31:17.794
from blood transfusions,
tainted meat.

31:18.086 --> 31:19.588
As far as we know, yes.

31:20.005 --> 31:22.007
Well, she didn't get any blood

31:22.299 --> 31:25.093
and she ate the same
things I ate, so...

31:25.802 --> 31:29.306
How come she got sick and I didn't?

31:29.515 --> 31:32.309
That's what I'm going to find
out Miss. McKinley.

31:37.481 --> 31:40.108
She was fine.
You know...

31:41.193 --> 31:43.987
Sunday I went to her piano recital.

31:44.613 --> 31:46.114
She played so beautifully.

31:46.198 --> 31:48.700
Just the scales, you know,
little things.

31:49.201 --> 31:51.703
She... she didn't miss a note and...

31:54.581 --> 31:58.710
when she came home from school
on Tuesday, she was tired.

32:00.212 --> 32:03.507
She couldn't seem to control her hands.

32:03.799 --> 32:06.009
It would be one of the first symptoms
of the disease.

32:06.176 --> 32:08.804
Oh, God. I should have done
something sooner.

32:08.804 --> 32:12.891
No, no... There's no way you could have
known what was happening.

32:13.183 --> 32:14.601
It got worse.

32:14.810 --> 32:16.311
She couldn't play the piano.

32:16.478 --> 32:20.399
She couldn't even remember her
recital pieces,

32:20.607 --> 32:23.485
and then she seemed so lost.
She just looked at me.

32:23.694 --> 32:25.612
She was so lost.

32:25.779 --> 32:27.698
I'm so sorry.

32:27.906 --> 32:29.783
The next day,

32:29.992 --> 32:32.578
she was seeing things that
weren't even there.

32:32.786 --> 32:36.582
She was having trouble walking.

32:36.790 --> 32:40.210
The doctors, they did a scan of
her brain, but there's was nothing...

32:40.502 --> 32:43.714
There was nothing
they could see, anyway.

32:44.506 --> 32:47.509
But then they told me that
she had this disease,

32:47.801 --> 32:51.597
something that only 60 or 70
year old people get.

32:52.014 --> 32:54.099
Old people, you know?

32:54.600 --> 32:55.601
Yes.

32:57.186 --> 32:58.896
Well, why?

32:59.104 --> 33:02.191
Why did this happen to my baby?

33:24.588 --> 33:26.590
The infectious prion didn't
come from a cow.

33:26.882 --> 33:28.717
What then? A sheep?
Wild animal? What?

33:28.800 --> 33:29.801
Well, are you ready for this?

33:30.010 --> 33:31.178
It's a human prion.

33:31.178 --> 33:33.305
You know, we've already ruled
out a natural occurrence.

33:33.305 --> 33:35.098
Statistically it's too much
of a long shot.

33:35.098 --> 33:36.517
- I know.
- So, what are you saying?

33:36.600 --> 33:39.811
It's a human prion, so these people had
to be feeding on other people.

33:39.978 --> 33:42.105
A 5 year old cannibal?
Show me the numbers.

33:42.481 --> 33:43.982
Hey, did you get anything
off this?

33:44.191 --> 33:45.692
No, I haven't gotten to it yet.
I will, I will.

33:45.984 --> 33:46.693
Okay, here you go.

33:46.777 --> 33:50.197
This is the protein sequence
from Mr. White's brain prions.

33:50.489 --> 33:52.199
The 52 year old from Texas.

33:52.407 --> 33:55.786
And this is the sequencing for
the foreign prion we found in his brain.

33:56.078 --> 33:58.080
They look the same to me, Bob.

33:58.413 --> 33:59.915
99.8% the same.

34:00.207 --> 34:02.209
See this peptide right here?

34:02.793 --> 34:05.212
That's the difference.
Both human prions:

34:05.504 --> 34:08.005
One his, one from somebody else.

34:08.215 --> 34:09.591
Well, that's just...

34:09.591 --> 34:10.300
wrong.

34:10.509 --> 34:12.302
Did you ever see "Sweeney Todd"?

34:12.511 --> 34:15.013
The poor guy probably didn't
even know he was eating human flesh.

34:15.097 --> 34:16.389
Is this the same in
all the victims?

34:16.389 --> 34:18.600
Yeah, I'm waiting for Carlos to get back
with new brain tissue from the little girl.

34:18.809 --> 34:19.810
Who prepared the samples?

34:19.810 --> 34:21.812
Mayko ran the mass spectrometer,
I analyzed it.

34:21.978 --> 34:23.981
- Mayko fucked up. That's the answer.
- I don't think so, David.

34:24.106 --> 34:25.607
- I was right here with her when she--
- Mayko!

34:26.190 --> 34:27.484
Where's your lab book?

34:28.485 --> 34:30.779
Okay, where's the section
on the sample prep?

34:31.196 --> 34:32.489
I didn't write that up yet.

34:32.697 --> 34:33.699
What?

34:34.699 --> 34:39.079
You think you could have screwed up
the mass spec on the prion sample?

34:39.204 --> 34:39.788
No.

34:39.788 --> 34:42.498
Okay, well I think you did.
Do it over.

34:43.500 --> 34:44.710
I didn't make a mistake!

34:44.918 --> 34:46.795
I don't care what you think,
run the test again.

34:47.087 --> 34:48.088
Well, could I ask why?

34:48.297 --> 34:51.592
Two human prions? Jesus, Mayko,
could you just do what I ask?!

34:51.800 --> 34:54.386
The numbers don't make any sense?!
I think you screwed up, okay?!

34:54.594 --> 34:57.681
Yeah, sure. If anyone's goingto screw up
around here it's probably going to be me!

34:57.681 --> 34:59.099
I think David just
wants you to check--

34:59.183 --> 35:02.186
I know what he wants from me,
Bob! Fuck him!

35:03.896 --> 35:05.480
I think she's been having
a hard time with Hira--

35:05.689 --> 35:07.482
Just run another sample, Bob.

35:08.108 --> 35:09.318
Sure.

35:46.688 --> 35:47.981
What are you doing?

35:48.190 --> 35:51.318
- I always wanted this locker.
- It's mine, Bob.

35:51.401 --> 35:53.487
- But you're going aren't you?
- I didn't say that.

35:53.487 --> 35:57.115
Yes you did. Not in so many
words, but you said it.

35:59.201 --> 36:01.703
Put my stuff back, Bob!

36:04.915 --> 36:06.917
I didn't say I was
going anywhere.

36:13.799 --> 36:15.592
Mayko.

36:16.301 --> 36:18.387
Mayko, you okay?

36:22.099 --> 36:25.310
Okay, here you go. P-228,

36:25.394 --> 36:27.396
semi automatic, 10 round clip.

36:28.480 --> 36:30.983
You can carry it in your purse.
You're not serious.

36:31.108 --> 36:32.985
Best protection you can get.

36:33.318 --> 36:35.404
I'm not going to carry
a gun around.

36:35.404 --> 36:36.697
It might make you feel
a little safer.

36:36.697 --> 36:40.117
I'm not going to carry
a gun around!

36:41.285 --> 36:42.202
Okay, well...

36:43.203 --> 36:47.082
if you change your mind,
you know where to find me.

36:49.585 --> 36:51.795
You want to go for a run?

36:52.713 --> 36:54.715
I already did that, Carlos.

36:55.382 --> 36:57.801
- I'll go with you.
- I'm asking Mayko.

36:58.093 --> 37:00.304
What's wrong with Hira?

37:01.597 --> 37:03.098
It's all right,
I understand.

37:03.515 --> 37:04.808
You understand?

37:05.100 --> 37:08.604
What do you understand?
How can you understand?

37:09.188 --> 37:10.814
Because I have to May.

37:11.106 --> 37:13.609
I can't change anything.
I have to understand.

37:13.901 --> 37:15.903
It's perfect sense to me.

37:17.988 --> 37:20.908
It's so easy for you
isn't it, Carlos?

38:54.084 --> 38:56.211
Yeah, he's fine.

38:56.211 --> 38:58.714
He just walked in actually.
Do you want to talk to him?

39:01.592 --> 39:02.509
Who is it?

39:02.718 --> 39:03.802
It's mum.

39:06.305 --> 39:08.599
Hello, Sarah, how are you?

39:12.811 --> 39:15.480
"I anticipate we'll remain in seclusion

39:15.606 --> 39:19.109
until well after the Christ
child is reborn,

39:19.109 --> 39:22.487
for his own safety and security,
so that the Christ child..."

39:24.281 --> 39:25.991
Yeah, okay bye.

39:26.909 --> 39:28.994
Between your mother and that
Reverend Walsh,

39:29.119 --> 39:30.996
I am definitely going to hell.

39:30.996 --> 39:34.208
Yeah, well this is going to cheer you up.
A cop brought this by today.

39:34.291 --> 39:37.002
- Walsh is pressing charges?!
- You decked him.

39:37.085 --> 39:39.213
I barely touched him!

39:39.213 --> 39:43.008
Well I rented "Anger Management" today just
so you could get a general idea about...

39:43.300 --> 39:46.386
I'm not taking anger fucking
management classes.

39:49.097 --> 39:51.016
What's all this?

39:51.808 --> 39:55.187
I was just hanging out
with Mick today.

40:00.692 --> 40:04.404
You know, Lilith, we are going
over all the research.

40:04.821 --> 40:06.114
Sure.

40:06.198 --> 40:08.909
And I mean, I wish I could tell you
everything's going to be fine but--

40:08.909 --> 40:13.288
You know, I really don't need your
Dr. Phil shit, thanks.

40:13.413 --> 40:14.998
Sorry.

40:15.082 --> 40:18.585
No, no. You're right.
You don't.

40:25.300 --> 40:28.804
You know, I don't think I've got
a single picture of Hira.

40:29.304 --> 40:32.683
Why are the best pictures
always out of focus?

40:33.016 --> 40:35.310
I didn't even get to know her
that well, not really.

40:35.519 --> 40:37.104
Which one of these 2?

40:37.312 --> 40:38.689
The one on the right.

40:45.696 --> 40:48.907
You think there's something
wrong with me, Lilith?

40:49.116 --> 40:51.618
Oh, where do I begin?

40:56.707 --> 40:59.710
How long was Mr. White
a vegetarian?

41:00.586 --> 41:03.297
I see. And no common dentist?

41:03.297 --> 41:06.800
He never crossed paths with any
of the other victims?

41:06.800 --> 41:09.011
Okay. Thank you, Wes.

41:12.181 --> 41:14.099
Hey. How'd it go in Tampa?

41:14.308 --> 41:14.892
Uh, good.

41:15.100 --> 41:18.520
I already ran the new samples
from the little girl. Same as before.

41:18.520 --> 41:20.606
Human prions?

41:20.689 --> 41:22.107
We're not coming up with any
external common links.

41:22.191 --> 41:23.692
- Internal?
- Maybe.

41:23.692 --> 41:25.694
I found high titer
antibodies in her blood,

41:25.819 --> 41:28.197
check all the other victims,
same high levels.

41:28.322 --> 41:29.406
An infection?

41:29.615 --> 41:31.783
I'm going to scan their
blood for viruses.

41:33.911 --> 41:35.704
It could be a common link.

41:35.787 --> 41:38.707
Okay, you know what?
I want you to check animal viruses too.

41:38.790 --> 41:40.501
This thing's so bizarre, who knows.

41:40.501 --> 41:41.210
Right.

41:43.712 --> 41:44.421
David.

41:44.588 --> 41:46.590
Caroline wants you to take
a look at these.

41:46.715 --> 41:47.799
What does she want me
to do with them?

41:47.883 --> 41:49.593
- They're potential virologists.
- Later, Wes.

41:49.593 --> 41:52.095
I took the liberty of setting up
an interview with one of the candidates.

41:52.095 --> 41:53.889
She's going to be in Chicago
while you're there.

41:54.014 --> 41:55.307
Look, don't do any more
setting up okay, Wes?

41:55.599 --> 41:57.309
I will find a replacement for Hira

41:57.309 --> 42:00.020
when I am ready to find a
replacement for Hira.

42:00.187 --> 42:02.689
Her name's Jill Langston,
Monday morning, 8 a.m., your hotel.

42:02.981 --> 42:05.984
I don't get up that early.
Hey, Bob.

42:06.109 --> 42:09.196
Did you run the saliva
on that beer bottle yet?

42:10.405 --> 42:11.782
What are you reading?

42:13.992 --> 42:15.494
Bob!

42:15.619 --> 42:18.705
Did you run the saliva on
the beer bottle yet?

42:18.914 --> 42:20.290
Yeah, I put a report
on your desk.

42:20.499 --> 42:22.292
- Anything?
- Nothing out of the ordinary.

42:22.501 --> 42:25.212
- Steroids, hormones?
- Nothing I could identify.

42:26.505 --> 42:27.714
Good boy, Danny.

42:31.385 --> 42:32.803
Good book?

42:32.886 --> 42:36.014
Yeah, good. Cervantes still
makes me laugh.

42:36.807 --> 42:38.600
You got a minute?

42:38.684 --> 42:39.518
Sure.

42:39.810 --> 42:42.396
So, I started looking for things
that connected the victims.

42:42.813 --> 42:44.523
- Internally, right?
- Yeah, yeah, of course.

42:44.606 --> 42:45.816
So, this is really cool.

42:45.983 --> 42:49.611
I isolated their DNA and
did microarrays on each of them.

42:49.820 --> 42:51.405
What?

42:52.906 --> 42:54.283
You okay?

42:54.992 --> 42:55.993
Yeah.

42:58.203 --> 43:00.998
I don't think you're a fuck up.

43:01.290 --> 43:03.500
Yeah, I don't think
you are either.

43:03.709 --> 43:08.213
So, I thought I'd look for common
genetic patterns that connected them.

43:08.088 --> 43:12.217
The victims are 99.99%
like every other human out there

43:12.217 --> 43:13.510
but... look at this.

43:14.511 --> 43:15.596
What's that gene?

43:15.721 --> 43:18.807
A hot new transporter, just
posted on the internet.

43:19.016 --> 43:22.686
They think it channels proteins
across the blood brain barrier.

43:22.811 --> 43:23.604
See, see right there?

43:23.687 --> 43:27.900
The barrier's supposed to keep chemicals
from crossing into the brain, right?

43:27.983 --> 43:31.403
But, with this transporter,
it doesn't.

43:31.612 --> 43:35.616
And the interesting thing is
the victims all have this transporter.

43:35.908 --> 43:38.118
- And it's really rare, David.
- How rare?

43:38.410 --> 43:40.704
Like 1 in 10,000,000
people have it.

43:40.787 --> 43:43.123
So this little transporter
gene is a trigger firing mutant prions

43:43.207 --> 43:46.084
from the blood to the
brain at an incredible rate?

43:46.210 --> 43:47.503
So, the victims eats infectious agent,

43:47.586 --> 43:49.421
a huge mass of prions move into the brain,

43:49.713 --> 43:51.924
victim shows symptoms and is
dead in a week.

43:52.090 --> 43:54.885
If you're right, it would explain
the accelerated course of the disease.

43:55.093 --> 43:56.887
But it still doesn't tell us
where it came from.

43:57.095 --> 43:59.515
Nope, but it gets us a little bit closer.

43:59.806 --> 44:00.682
Good work.

44:19.284 --> 44:21.495
Oh, you can still get it
from infected meat,

44:21.703 --> 44:23.789
scrapie in sheep,
mad cow in cattle.

44:23.997 --> 44:26.416
It would take a brain 7 maybe 8 years
to get in this condition.

44:26.500 --> 44:28.210
All victims died within a week of
showing symptoms.

44:28.418 --> 44:31.505
Both human prions:
one his, one from somebody else.

44:32.297 --> 44:33.799
So how are they getting it?

44:34.883 --> 44:36.218
The mice weren't affected.

44:36.510 --> 44:38.512
We tried to suspend the prions in the air,

44:38.804 --> 44:40.097
but it wasn't possible.

44:40.305 --> 44:41.223
- No exceptions?
- None.

44:41.390 --> 44:43.100
But there was a 48% success rate

44:43.100 --> 44:45.686
by aspirating the prions directly
at the test animals.

44:46.103 --> 44:48.522
So, that would mean transfer
through a sneeze or cough.

44:48.605 --> 44:50.023
Yeah, which would eliminate
transfer by air,

44:50.107 --> 44:52.401
since the victims never came
into contact with each other.

44:52.484 --> 44:53.610
Yeah, they didn't.

44:55.404 --> 44:57.906
No contact with each other,
a vegetarian,

44:57.990 --> 44:59.992
5 year old child.

45:00.492 --> 45:02.494
What's the link? What's the link ?

45:02.703 --> 45:04.121
- Carlos.
- Hey.

45:05.289 --> 45:07.916
So, the water from San Antonio,
Santa Barbara, Tampa,

45:08.208 --> 45:12.713
all your normal ingredients: barium,
fluoride, nitrite, tetrachloroethylene,

45:13.005 --> 45:15.799
- but not one single prion.
- It was a long shot anyway.

45:16.008 --> 45:18.218
Any family history of prion disease?

45:18.510 --> 45:20.721
No. The first thing I checked. Nothing.

45:21.513 --> 45:23.390
David, this report just came in.

45:23.599 --> 45:26.810
There's no common links to
any doctor or dentist.

45:31.607 --> 45:33.317
No common link, mad cow,

45:33.609 --> 45:35.485
tainted meat, vegetarian.

45:36.195 --> 45:37.321
Fuck!

45:43.410 --> 45:45.913
I need more This thing's got to
be coming out of the food chain.

45:46.121 --> 45:47.206
It's the only thing
we've got left.

45:47.414 --> 45:50.000
I'll go back, get more details out of
the victim's families.

45:50.209 --> 45:52.294
I need a complete list of
everything they ate

45:52.503 --> 45:54.087
for at least the last month,
and I mean everything.

45:54.296 --> 45:55.422
- Sorry, I'm late.
- What? What?

45:55.714 --> 45:57.799
- It's ALV, David.
- In all of them?

45:58.008 --> 45:59.092
- All of them.
- ALV?

45:59.384 --> 46:00.719
Avian Leukemia Virus.

46:00.886 --> 46:04.598
We use ALV as a genetic trick to
make human proteins

46:04.806 --> 46:08.101
in eggs which is what we use to
make vaccines.

46:08.393 --> 46:10.896
So, this could be spreading
through flu vaccination?

46:11.104 --> 46:13.690
Flu vaccination, hepatitis, DPT.

46:13.899 --> 46:15.317
What about chickens, eggs?

46:15.484 --> 46:17.402
Right, they could easily be
carrying the ALV.

46:19.613 --> 46:22.115
It makes perfect sense.
All the pieces fit.

46:22.491 --> 46:25.410
Well, 3 common links are
better than none.

46:26.119 --> 46:27.704
- A super transporter, David.
- Oh, shit.

46:27.913 --> 46:28.789
What is it?

46:29.122 --> 46:31.124
Mayko found a gene
in all the victims.

46:31.208 --> 46:34.211
We think it might be accelerating
the prions into the brain.

46:34.503 --> 46:35.295
Accelerating?

46:35.420 --> 46:37.923
So, if the prions move at a
normal rate

46:38.215 --> 46:40.509
and people who don't have this
super transporter...

46:41.009 --> 46:44.388
Then the symptoms should start
showing up in about 7 or 8 years.

46:44.596 --> 46:46.098
How many people are
we talking about?

46:46.723 --> 46:49.101
How many people ate
a piece of chicken, an egg,

46:49.685 --> 46:52.896
or got a flu shot lately?

47:00.320 --> 47:02.990
Mad cow, where do you find
prion samples?

47:03.198 --> 47:04.491
In 4 dead people.

47:04.700 --> 47:07.119
Sarah McKinley ate chicken
tenders at Lord of the Chicken

47:07.411 --> 47:09.413
at least 3 times in the last month.

47:09.705 --> 47:13.125
You don't understand, this is
a government operated lab I'm in now.

47:13.500 --> 47:15.586
I told you, I don't know what
they'd do if they found out.

47:15.919 --> 47:17.504
- What did you take?
- I don't know.

47:18.213 --> 47:20.716
Well, it's not biaxin.
Now who is the wide world of sports

47:20.924 --> 47:22.885
is experimenting with gene doping?

47:23.093 --> 47:23.886
What?

47:24.094 --> 47:25.220
Good morning.

47:25.387 --> 47:28.015
I'm looking for a new
scientist, not a name dropper.

47:29.016 --> 47:31.810
- How much of an asshole was I this morning?
- You were up there.

47:32.102 --> 47:33.520
I certainly have enough to go public

47:33.687 --> 47:35.814
and point a finger at
White Valley Farms' chicken.

47:36.190 --> 47:39.610
Surely you understand
the ramifications of going public.

47:39.902 --> 47:42.487
These chickens could be carrying
a fucking death sentence

47:42.696 --> 47:44.990
for millions of people.

47:49.786 --> 47:52.623
