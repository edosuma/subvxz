WEBVTT

00:03.177 --> 00:05.657
But I can't be sick,
tomorrow's Thanksgiving.

00:05.744 --> 00:07.485
And if you were
a butterball turkey

00:07.572 --> 00:10.097
you would be done right now.

00:10.184 --> 00:11.446
You know what,
if I sit in the kitchen

00:11.533 --> 00:13.839
while you're cooking,
I can just sweat it out.

00:13.926 --> 00:16.103
You're a trooper, but I don't
think you should push yourself.

00:16.190 --> 00:18.844
W-we'll have a wonderful
Thanksgiving next year.

00:18.931 --> 00:20.629
I got to wait
a whole year for turkey

00:20.716 --> 00:23.458
and stuffing and pumpkin pie?

00:23.545 --> 00:25.155
See how sick you are,
You didn't even mention

00:25.242 --> 00:28.506
mashed potatoes
or the cranberry sauce.

00:28.593 --> 00:31.031
Damn this fever.

00:31.118 --> 00:34.034
You rest. I'm gonna go break
the news to mom and Victoria.

00:34.121 --> 00:35.470
Tell 'em I'm sorry.

00:35.557 --> 00:37.428
They'll be disappointed,
but they'll understand.

00:38.690 --> 00:39.865
And gravy.

00:39.952 --> 00:41.606
How could I forget the gravy?

00:41.693 --> 00:44.566
This might be malaria.

00:44.653 --> 00:47.612
Well, if it is malaria,
you should stop talking.

00:50.789 --> 00:52.748
- Well, how is he?
- He's sick as a dog.

00:52.835 --> 00:54.837
- So we don't have to cook?
- We don't have to do nothing.

00:54.924 --> 00:57.144
He can't even get down
a piece of toast.

00:57.231 --> 01:00.234
It's a miracle.
It's a holiday miracle.

01:00.321 --> 01:04.368
[Mike]
'What is going on out there?'

01:04.455 --> 01:06.414
♪ For the first time ♪

01:06.501 --> 01:08.416
♪ In my life ♪

01:09.895 --> 01:12.202
♪ I see love ♪♪

01:24.562 --> 01:25.824
No, Molly, I understand.

01:25.911 --> 01:28.175
Why chum the water
when the shark is sick?

01:28.262 --> 01:29.959
Yeah. Yeah, I'll tell Samuel.

01:30.046 --> 01:31.700
Yeah, and if you can't
get him to take his Aspirin

01:31.787 --> 01:34.920
hide it in a cheese cube.

01:35.007 --> 01:38.359
Yeah, that's how
I get him to take his beano.

01:38.446 --> 01:40.317
Okay. Bye.

01:40.404 --> 01:42.493
Mike is sick on Thanksgiving.

01:43.973 --> 01:45.148
I can't even imagine
how this is going

01:45.235 --> 01:46.889
to affect the economy.

01:48.543 --> 01:49.979
Well, you don't need
to check the papers to know

01:50.066 --> 01:51.937
that pumpkin pie futures
are gonna be way down.

01:53.809 --> 01:56.028
Now, is he really sick,
or is this like the day after

01:56.116 --> 01:57.769
the all you can eat
hot wing incident?

01:57.856 --> 01:59.597
Uh-uh, no, when he
can't get out of bed

01:59.684 --> 02:03.384
for a Thanksgiving meal,
he's down for the count.

02:03.471 --> 02:05.647
Even after the three dozen
hot wings he still came to work.

02:05.734 --> 02:08.258
The smell of tabasco oozing
from his pores.

02:10.434 --> 02:12.262
And the mournful cries
from the bathroom of.

02:12.349 --> 02:14.221
It burns!
Oh, God, it burns.

02:15.831 --> 02:18.138
Well, I'm surprised
he's not sick all the time.

02:18.225 --> 02:20.314
That man never washes his hands.

02:20.401 --> 02:22.446
Yeah, our cook is exactly
the same way.

02:24.231 --> 02:25.971
And he's a picker.

02:27.277 --> 02:29.018
- Picks what?
- You name it.

02:29.105 --> 02:30.976
If he can reach it,
he picks it.

02:33.414 --> 02:35.067
Anyway, what are we doing
for Thanksgiving now?

02:35.155 --> 02:37.026
Well, we're certainly
not gonna eat here.

02:39.637 --> 02:43.032
Hey, there's a singles
potluck at my church.

02:43.119 --> 02:46.383
Good home cooked meal,
plenty of available women.

02:46.470 --> 02:48.037
You're not suggesting
we hit on women

02:48.124 --> 02:49.430
in a house of worship,
are you?

02:49.517 --> 02:51.040
Some of the nastiest women
I've ever met

02:51.127 --> 02:53.999
has been at church.

02:54.086 --> 02:56.437
The first bare boob I ever saw
was a Deacon's daughter.

02:58.308 --> 02:59.875
- Really?
- Oh, she was a freak too.

02:59.962 --> 03:01.833
Said I could touch it
for five dollars.

03:03.444 --> 03:05.272
Three of which was supposed
to go to UNICEF.

03:07.448 --> 03:09.450
I am intrigued.

03:09.537 --> 03:12.104
And yet I worry that without
the benefits of alcohol

03:12.192 --> 03:14.629
and loud techno music,
a spotlight will be shown

03:14.716 --> 03:17.501
on the fact that,
I'm a horny, penniless waiter.

03:17.588 --> 03:18.937
No, no. No, no. No.

03:19.024 --> 03:22.463
What you are is-is a mysterious,
exotic immigrant

03:22.550 --> 03:24.943
lookin' to make good
in the land of opportunity.

03:26.858 --> 03:29.731
And all I need is the love
of a good Christian woman

03:29.818 --> 03:33.300
who truly understands that the
meek shall inherit the Earth.

03:33.387 --> 03:36.128
And the last shall be first.

03:36.216 --> 03:38.087
They don't call it the sermon
on the mount for nothin'.

03:40.481 --> 03:44.485
So are we talking full dashiki
and no speakee-dee English?

03:44.572 --> 03:46.965
Mm-hm, yeah, but luckily,
your charitable

03:47.052 --> 03:49.577
American benefactor
will be there to translate.

03:49.664 --> 03:53.233
You much good friend to Samuel..

03:55.365 --> 03:56.888
...Mr. Carl.

03:58.281 --> 03:59.935
One world,
one love, my brother.

04:00.022 --> 04:01.763
[laughing]

04:03.373 --> 04:05.201
Take a couple more bites,
it's chicken soup

04:05.288 --> 04:06.507
it's good for you.

04:06.594 --> 04:07.899
It's chicken and noodles.

04:07.986 --> 04:09.858
I like chicken and stars.

04:12.469 --> 04:14.863
Sweetie, it's,
it's the same thing.

04:14.950 --> 04:16.908
No, it's not.

04:16.995 --> 04:19.259
Stars are chewy,
and noodles are slurpy.

04:21.043 --> 04:23.350
Well, why don't you just

04:23.437 --> 04:25.700
chew the noodles
into lil' stars?

04:28.572 --> 04:31.793
Hey, doll, great news,
my brother's in town

04:31.880 --> 04:33.534
and he's coming over
for Thanksgiving.

04:33.621 --> 04:35.318
Oh, I hope
he likes Chinese food.

04:35.405 --> 04:37.494
We're not cooking this year.
What are you talking about?

04:37.581 --> 04:39.801
Well, with the
eating machine on the Fritz

04:39.888 --> 04:42.630
it's every man for himself.

04:42.717 --> 04:44.806
But I promised Frankie a big,
home cooked meal.

04:44.893 --> 04:46.590
Even went out
and got his favorite wine.

04:46.677 --> 04:48.940
Oh!

04:49.027 --> 04:51.160
Red.

04:51.247 --> 04:53.902
That's my favorite too.

04:53.989 --> 04:55.730
"I don't like noodles.
I like stars."

04:55.817 --> 04:58.820
I'll show you stars
right in your noodle.

04:58.907 --> 05:01.213
What's all this about
turkey day getting canceled?

05:01.301 --> 05:02.824
Mike's sick as a dog,
I'm not gonna go to all

05:02.911 --> 05:04.391
the trouble for nothin'.

05:04.478 --> 05:06.218
Kind of a big decision
to make without calling

05:06.306 --> 05:08.351
a family meeting,
don't you think?

05:08.438 --> 05:10.135
We actually
don't have family meetings

05:10.222 --> 05:14.009
which is one of the main
reasons you're still here.

05:14.096 --> 05:17.404
Joyce, I promised my brother
an old fashioned Thanksgiving

05:17.491 --> 05:19.667
with my loving wife
and my loving family.

05:19.754 --> 05:21.582
- Wife?
- You know what I mean.

05:21.669 --> 05:23.975
Wife to be.
We're practically married.

05:24.062 --> 05:25.803
Practically nothing.

05:25.890 --> 05:28.066
It's been over a year
since you stuck this fake

05:28.153 --> 05:30.068
rock on my hand.

05:30.155 --> 05:32.636
And I haven't heard a peep
about an actual wedding date.

05:32.723 --> 05:35.683
Oh, I see, you're trying
to use this as blackmail

05:35.770 --> 05:37.728
to get me to marry you.
Very nice.

05:37.815 --> 05:39.904
Blackmail you? Ugh!

05:39.991 --> 05:42.167
I'm sorry,
I-I was under the impression

05:42.254 --> 05:43.865
you wanted to marry me.

05:43.952 --> 05:46.563
What I want you to do
is stick a fistful of bread

05:46.650 --> 05:49.349
up a turkey's ass
and toss it in the oven.

05:51.438 --> 05:55.093
Well, hand me a loaf
of rye bread and bend over.

06:06.235 --> 06:07.628
Alright, don't sneeze on me

06:07.715 --> 06:10.021
cough on me
or fart on my leg.

06:12.981 --> 06:15.766
Molly?

06:15.853 --> 06:18.029
No, your wife called
first dibs on the couch

06:18.116 --> 06:20.336
and since Joyce
won't let me in our bed

06:20.423 --> 06:22.686
I have to bunk
with patient zero.

06:25.254 --> 06:27.125
Are those your feet
under my legs?

06:27.212 --> 06:29.432
You mind, they're ice cold
and your calves are like

06:29.519 --> 06:31.042
a fire pit.

06:34.785 --> 06:37.788
Actually,
the cold's kinda nice.

06:37.875 --> 06:39.834
What's the big deal
about a piece of paper?

06:39.921 --> 06:42.706
She knows I love her.
What more does she want?

06:42.793 --> 06:44.665
Will you hand me my water?

06:44.752 --> 06:46.623
Absolutely.

06:50.410 --> 06:52.368
Wow.

06:52.455 --> 06:56.154
Like leaning over a 300 pound
microwaved burrito.

06:58.113 --> 06:59.244
Thirsty.

06:59.331 --> 07:01.246
Yeah, yeah, sit up a little.

07:03.074 --> 07:06.077
Don't drink too much,
'cause I'm not gonna give you

07:06.164 --> 07:08.079
a piggyback ride to the can.

07:10.081 --> 07:12.780
I love bendy straws.

07:12.867 --> 07:15.391
Yeah, women have
to complicate everything.

07:15.478 --> 07:17.088
You ever notice
the only time they're happy

07:17.175 --> 07:19.569
is when they're makin'
you miserable?

07:19.656 --> 07:22.354
Crazy straws are fun too.
Do they still make those?

07:23.747 --> 07:25.532
Men don't like all that drama.

07:25.619 --> 07:27.664
We're simple folk.

07:27.751 --> 07:30.058
You know,
sometimes I think

07:30.145 --> 07:32.190
gay guys really got it made.

07:33.714 --> 07:35.585
Okay, move your feet.

07:37.587 --> 07:38.980
I'm just saying..

07:39.067 --> 07:41.330
...with women,
a guy's word isn't enough.

07:41.417 --> 07:43.332
Remember when I promised you
tickets to the bears game?

07:43.419 --> 07:44.681
Yeah, I do.

07:44.768 --> 07:46.030
And did I make good
on that promise?

07:46.117 --> 07:47.205
No, you did not.

07:47.292 --> 07:49.251
And yet...here we are

07:49.338 --> 07:51.601
snuggled up like
two bugs in a rug.

07:52.950 --> 07:54.561
My life would be
so much easier

07:54.648 --> 07:56.519
if I liked to drive stick.

07:59.130 --> 08:01.524
- I think I'm gonna throw up.
- Hey.

08:01.611 --> 08:04.353
whoa, it's not like
you're my type, either.

08:04.440 --> 08:07.617
Plus, you could do
a lot worse than me.

08:07.704 --> 08:09.140
No, I really think
I'm gonna throw up.

08:09.227 --> 08:11.142
Oh, alright.

08:11.229 --> 08:13.580
I'll get you a bucket
and some ice chips.

08:13.667 --> 08:15.886
I'm just saying,
your wife's downstairs

08:15.973 --> 08:18.149
and I'm up here
taking care of you.

08:18.236 --> 08:20.108
Don't tell me I'm not a catch.

08:23.459 --> 08:25.896
I really hope
this is a fever dream.

08:30.510 --> 08:32.512
[clattering]

08:32.599 --> 08:33.730
What the hell?

08:33.817 --> 08:36.037
[clattering]

08:36.124 --> 08:37.778
Dammit!
Who organized this kitchen?

08:37.865 --> 08:39.780
Jose Feliciano?

08:39.867 --> 08:41.956
Vince, what are you doing?

08:42.043 --> 08:43.697
It's 6 o'clock in the morning.

08:43.784 --> 08:47.135
6:00? I got to get
my birds in the oven.

08:47.222 --> 08:48.832
Birds?

08:48.919 --> 08:50.965
They were all out of turkeys,
so I got nine Cornish hens

08:51.052 --> 08:52.923
and two chicken fryers.

08:53.010 --> 08:55.447
- How many ladies leaping?
- Apparently none.

08:55.535 --> 08:58.538
I'm cooking
this whole thing by myself.

08:58.625 --> 09:00.757
Hey, you can't blame mom
for being mad at you, Vince.

09:00.844 --> 09:02.846
You've dragged this
engagement out a long time.

09:02.933 --> 09:04.587
Hey, I want to marry her.

09:04.674 --> 09:06.546
I just need to wait
for the right time.

09:06.633 --> 09:08.112
Yeah, and when is that?

09:08.199 --> 09:09.984
When I'm not dead ass broke.

09:10.071 --> 09:11.551
What are you talking
about Broke?

09:11.638 --> 09:13.596
I thought your airline
pillow business was

09:13.683 --> 09:16.468
raking in the do-re-mi.

09:16.556 --> 09:18.732
I got knocked out
by the giant conglomerates.

09:18.819 --> 09:21.430
Turns out big little pillow
totally smothers

09:21.517 --> 09:23.780
little, little pillow.

09:23.867 --> 09:27.218
Uh, so you didn't have
any savings or anything?

09:27.305 --> 09:28.480
That got pretty
well chewed through

09:28.568 --> 09:30.482
when my first wife got sick.

09:30.570 --> 09:33.877
Between the hospital bills
and home care..

09:33.964 --> 09:35.487
...I was tapped out.

09:36.401 --> 09:38.578
Oh. I didn't know that.

09:39.796 --> 09:41.755
Bunny hated hospitals.

09:41.842 --> 09:44.584
It was better for her to be
home so I could be with her.

09:47.456 --> 09:49.589
Well, have you,
have you told mom this?

09:49.676 --> 09:51.678
No, I don't want her
to think

09:51.765 --> 09:53.767
she's engaged
to some deadbeat.

09:53.854 --> 09:55.595
Besides,
I'm gonna turn it around

09:55.682 --> 09:57.161
and I'll be able
to take care of her

09:57.248 --> 09:59.424
in the fashion she deserves.

10:05.953 --> 10:08.651
So, uh,
how much stuffing can you get

10:08.738 --> 10:10.435
into one of these
Cornish game hens?

10:10.522 --> 10:13.264
I pack it in those tiny rumps
till they say uncle.

10:22.491 --> 10:24.058
Don't just mash 'em,
you gotta whip 'em

10:24.145 --> 10:25.929
so they're light and fluffy.

10:26.016 --> 10:28.018
Put your rotator cuff into it.

10:28.105 --> 10:30.368
Vince, give me a break,
I know how to mash potatoes.

10:30.455 --> 10:33.502
If you say so, but I'm looking
at some pretty sizeable lumps.

10:33.589 --> 10:35.852
Yeah, an-and I'm talking
to one.

10:35.939 --> 10:37.811
If you wanna do the potatoes,
be my guest.

10:37.898 --> 10:39.726
I'm in charge of the birds
and the pasta.

10:39.813 --> 10:41.249
You're in charge of all
the side dishes

10:41.336 --> 10:42.729
and keepin'
the liquor flowin'.

10:42.816 --> 10:45.253
Oh, okay, I can handle that.

10:45.340 --> 10:47.168
Hey,
I was letting that breathe!

10:47.255 --> 10:49.779
Which is what I'm doing
to you, thanks to this wine.

10:52.477 --> 10:53.827
They were all
out of black olives

10:53.914 --> 10:56.046
so I got green ones
and soy sauce.

10:56.133 --> 10:59.702
I figured we can dye
'em like Easter eggs.

10:59.789 --> 11:01.356
Her volunteering
to help is kind

11:01.443 --> 11:03.227
of a mixed blessing,
isn't it?

11:03.314 --> 11:04.402
That's why I sent her
on an errand.

11:04.489 --> 11:06.448
She usually gets lost.

11:08.406 --> 11:10.670
[piano music]

11:12.106 --> 11:13.542
[indistinct chattering]

11:15.370 --> 11:17.807
[music continues]

11:26.163 --> 11:28.165
Crowd's a little bit
older than I expected.

11:31.429 --> 11:33.301
Yes, I'm guessing
several of these people

11:33.388 --> 11:35.433
were actually
at the first Thanksgiving.

11:37.305 --> 11:38.872
This is probably just
the early birds, you know

11:38.959 --> 11:39.960
I'm guessing
the younger crowd's gonna

11:40.047 --> 11:41.265
filter in a little bit later.

11:41.352 --> 11:42.658
Oh, good,
just in time to help us

11:42.745 --> 11:44.616
load the wheelchairs
into the vans.

11:46.227 --> 11:47.881
You know, when I heard
it was a singles thing

11:47.968 --> 11:50.013
I figured it was because
they hadn't found a husband

11:50.100 --> 11:51.972
not because
they'd buried one.

11:53.451 --> 11:54.975
At least one,
it's like walking

11:55.062 --> 11:56.846
into the "Thriller" video.

12:00.023 --> 12:01.895
I'm gonna warn you boys
off the stuffing.

12:01.982 --> 12:04.332
Miss Minerva's half blind
and those pecans

12:04.419 --> 12:07.117
could be anything from dog
treats to kidney medication.

12:08.902 --> 12:10.773
Grandma,
where's all the young people?

12:10.860 --> 12:12.253
Everybody here
is in the triple digits.

12:12.340 --> 12:13.602
I should've known
you weren't here

12:13.689 --> 12:14.995
for good
Christian fellowship

12:15.082 --> 12:17.171
when you showed up
with Kunta Kinte.

12:21.218 --> 12:24.221
This is actually traditional
Senegalese formal wear.

12:24.308 --> 12:26.746
Well, then I got a shower
curtain you can wear to prom.

12:30.053 --> 12:32.316
You boys need to get out
of here if you're just trying

12:32.403 --> 12:35.885
to knock some precious lamb
off of her righteous path.

12:35.972 --> 12:38.366
Ain't no lambs here.
Just old goats and mules.

12:40.194 --> 12:42.413
Listen, instead
of just standing around

12:42.500 --> 12:44.807
thinkin' nasty thoughts,
why don't you top off

12:44.894 --> 12:46.896
some sweet teas
or get these folks some pie.

12:46.983 --> 12:48.637
Okay, grandma.

12:48.724 --> 12:50.987
And when you take 'em pie
you might wanna hold

12:51.074 --> 12:52.380
a mirror under their noses.

12:52.467 --> 12:54.512
Don't just set it
on their laps and walk away.

12:54.599 --> 12:56.601
I worked hard on those pies.

12:59.953 --> 13:03.043
Great, so on my one day off
I have to serve people food.

13:05.045 --> 13:06.786
Thank you, Carl.

13:09.266 --> 13:10.354
Knock, knock.

13:10.441 --> 13:12.095
Did you bring me some 7up?

13:12.182 --> 13:14.968
No, I'm looking for a pair
of earrings I loaned Molly.

13:15.055 --> 13:16.839
Would you mind
bringing me some 7up?

13:16.926 --> 13:18.232
Sure!

13:18.319 --> 13:20.190
Why don't I wait
on you hand and foot

13:20.277 --> 13:22.062
let you have sex
with me every night

13:22.149 --> 13:23.628
and then when
it comes time to marry me

13:23.715 --> 13:26.153
you back out?

13:26.240 --> 13:29.896
If we don't have 7up,
ginger ale's fine.

13:29.983 --> 13:32.463
Vince and I have been engaged
for over a year.

13:32.550 --> 13:34.074
Why can't you men commit?

13:34.161 --> 13:37.077
And put a bendy straw in it.
I love bendy straws.

13:37.164 --> 13:39.296
You know,
I am not gonna twist

13:39.383 --> 13:41.429
anybody's arm
to get him to marry me.

13:41.516 --> 13:43.953
I am a vibrant, sexy woman.

13:44.040 --> 13:45.955
I can have any man I want.

13:46.042 --> 13:47.652
You know, I think
I could hold down a couple

13:47.739 --> 13:50.133
of saltines, if you're
headed to the kitchen.

13:50.220 --> 13:51.961
I think maybe it's time
to light a fire

13:52.048 --> 13:54.050
under Mr. Moranto's
hairy ass.

13:54.137 --> 13:55.269
Crackers!

13:55.356 --> 13:56.487

13:56.574 --> 13:58.794
Anything!

14:01.579 --> 14:03.277
You ladies did a wonderful job.

14:03.364 --> 14:05.148
- I really appreciate it.
- Aw.

14:05.235 --> 14:07.411
Now, get out of those rags
and put on something nice.

14:07.498 --> 14:10.023
My brother will be here
any minute.

14:11.154 --> 14:12.852

at least I'll look good.

There isn't a decent cannoli
for at least three miles.

14:27.954 --> 14:30.913
You don't consult a map when
you follow your heart, Francis.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.394
Allow me to introduce you
to my precious family.

14:33.481 --> 14:36.223
- Hi. I'm Molly.
- That's my oldest.

14:36.310 --> 14:38.921
She's a teacher,
a shaper of young minds.

14:39.008 --> 14:42.577
Little opinionated,
but the good with the bad.

14:42.664 --> 14:44.796
Okay, thank you, Vince.

14:44.884 --> 14:46.450
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah, it's a pleasure.

14:46.537 --> 14:47.930
What's the story with this one?

14:48.017 --> 14:51.194
I'm Victoria.
Vince's baby girl.

14:52.195 --> 14:53.457
I'm your Uncle Frankie.

for ice cream after dinner.

14:57.984 --> 15:00.377
Okay, you're one
of those Uncle Frankies.

15:00.464 --> 15:01.770
Come on, why don't you
help me in the kitchen?

15:01.857 --> 15:06.340
- What happened?
- You did nothing wrong.

15:06.427 --> 15:08.342
Was that the doorbell?

15:09.473 --> 15:11.475
You must be Francis.

15:11.562 --> 15:14.826
Well, I can see who got
the looks in the family.

15:14.914 --> 15:16.785

she's my--

15:16.872 --> 15:18.526
No, just Joyce.

to marry me for over a year

15:21.050 --> 15:22.443

15:22.530 --> 15:24.662
If you did,
you'd pop out of that dress.

15:24.749 --> 15:27.535
Oh! Oh-ho-ho, clever.

15:27.622 --> 15:29.754
Can I get you a drink,
I got you a whole case

15:29.841 --> 15:31.800

Malbec you like.
