Hang on.

00:36.841 --> 00:38.745
Don't make me late.

Go and learn something then.

- Hey, Bucky, kick rocks, man.
- Sorry, Coach.

01:02.859 --> 01:05.497
- See you, Bucky.
- It's okay. Get out of here.

01:05.497 --> 01:08.370
All right, everyone. When y'all
get released for the summer,

01:08.370 --> 01:09.873
don't be a bunch
of shitasses, all right?

01:09.873 --> 01:12.311
Know you're gonna be
out there partying around,

01:12.311 --> 01:15.317
drinking, whoring, fornicating,
glistening, engorging.

01:15.317 --> 01:17.656
Try and keep
your heads on straight.

01:17.656 --> 01:19.359
All right, get the hell
out of here now.

01:19.359 --> 01:21.129
Hold up, one more thing.

01:21.129 --> 01:23.400
Make sure you take your shit
from your dorm

01:23.400 --> 01:25.805
and your locker by 4:00 p.m.,
except for those of you

01:25.805 --> 01:27.875
that are staying here
for the summer.

01:30.447 --> 01:32.552
Hey, Maximus.

01:32.552 --> 01:35.157
Chebon.

01:35.157 --> 01:37.829
Oh, right. Chebon.

01:37.829 --> 01:39.566
Gonna be, uh, sticking
around here for the summer

01:39.566 --> 01:41.537
and, uh, staying
in the dorm with us?

01:41.537 --> 01:43.173
Yeah, yeah.

01:43.173 --> 01:44.677
Mm-hmm.

01:44.677 --> 01:46.446
Shit, man, if you get bored,
just, uh, hit me up.

01:46.446 --> 01:48.316
Get out and play
some ball or something.

01:48.316 --> 01:49.820
Just gonna be hanging around
here anyways all summer

01:49.820 --> 01:51.824
getting fat.

01:51.824 --> 01:54.495
Yeah, um, sounds good.

01:54.495 --> 01:56.566
- I'll let you know, thank you.
- All right, mm-hmm.

01:58.269 --> 02:00.942
All right, and, um, we are live.

02:00.942 --> 02:02.746
Welcome to the Chebon show.

02:02.746 --> 02:04.950
And what we have here
is the dying days

02:04.950 --> 02:07.656
of my junior year
and the seniors enjoy

02:07.656 --> 02:09.693
their final hours
of being top dog!

02:09.693 --> 02:12.331
Say hi, everything,
yeah, congratulations.

02:12.331 --> 02:14.302
Well, if it isn't Jimmy,
my favorite super senior

02:14.302 --> 02:16.607
in the world. That guy
right there, he's the man.

02:16.607 --> 02:18.310
Gave me some food one time.

02:18.310 --> 02:20.180
Oh. Well, if it isn't
these heads.

02:20.180 --> 02:23.955
Irene, my favorite asshole
in moccasins.

02:23.955 --> 02:25.658
I salute you.

02:25.658 --> 02:28.363
And how about you,
my dear Mabel?

02:28.363 --> 02:31.637
Did you storm any capitol steps
today or burn any flags?

02:31.637 --> 02:33.273
What's the deal?
Tell me about it.

02:33.273 --> 02:34.308
I'm really zoomed in
on your face right now.

02:34.308 --> 02:35.545
We burned something.

02:35.545 --> 02:36.680
Turn that off.
Brownie's waiting.

02:38.617 --> 02:39.887
You guys are boring.

02:39.887 --> 02:41.923
Did you get it?

02:42.926 --> 02:43.995
What?

02:43.995 --> 02:46.833
- The tabs?
- The windowpane.

02:49.271 --> 02:51.944
Um, shit, I forgot.

02:51.944 --> 02:53.915
- Yeah.
- You had one job.

02:53.915 --> 02:56.720
- I will, okay?
- Mm-hmm.

02:56.720 --> 02:58.423
I'll catch up with you guys
in a sec.

02:58.423 --> 03:00.327
Just have a little faith, okay?

03:00.327 --> 03:01.831
I'll get us windowpane.

03:01.831 --> 03:03.867
Easy. Chebon out.

03:06.907 --> 03:08.276
Perfect.

03:08.276 --> 03:09.913
All righty.

03:09.913 --> 03:12.418
Here we see Indian country's
answer to the Three Stooges:

03:12.418 --> 03:14.422
Limpy, Shrimpy and Pimply.

03:14.422 --> 03:16.025
- What's up, degenerates?
- Quit it, narc.

03:16.025 --> 03:18.430
Probably filming for the cops.

03:18.430 --> 03:19.967
All right, um, check it out.

03:19.967 --> 03:22.873
Me and my crew, we're looking
for some windowpane.

03:22.873 --> 03:24.710
You guys got any?

03:24.710 --> 03:26.379
Check your cousin.

03:26.379 --> 03:28.551
Maybe he has some.

03:28.551 --> 03:30.955
Yeah, Fixico always got some.
Damn medicine man.

03:33.326 --> 03:35.397
No.

03:35.397 --> 03:37.636
- Y'all still fighting?
- All over Mabel?

03:37.636 --> 03:39.907
No, we're, um,

03:39.907 --> 03:42.011
we're not fighting over Mabel.

03:42.011 --> 03:44.382
- Um, they broke up.
- Exactly.

03:44.382 --> 03:45.918
Family ain't supposed
to hold grudges.

03:50.595 --> 03:52.331
You sure you don't want to come
home with me for the summer?

03:52.331 --> 03:55.572
You know you love
my mom's fried pies.

03:55.572 --> 03:57.609
Yeah, um...

03:57.609 --> 03:59.546
No, I-I just don't want to be
a burden to anybody.

03:59.546 --> 04:02.853
Um, you know, I got tons of
movies to watch in the theater.

04:02.853 --> 04:07.528
Got tons of books to read,
too, so, yeah. Mm-hmm.

04:09.599 --> 04:11.603
Maybe you should make good
with Fixico.

04:15.377 --> 04:17.716
Why does everybody care
if we're good? I...

04:17.716 --> 04:20.855
Because he's your cousin.

04:20.855 --> 04:22.358
Y'all shouldn't stay mad.

04:22.358 --> 04:25.665
Yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm good.

04:25.665 --> 04:27.334
Plus you can stay at his place.

04:27.334 --> 04:29.506
Bro, I said I'm good.

04:29.506 --> 04:32.077
Ooh, okay.

04:32.077 --> 04:35.017
Okay. Yeesh.

04:35.017 --> 04:37.388
Sorry.

04:37.388 --> 04:39.860
You're just...
you're just trying to help.

04:39.860 --> 04:43.734
I'm good, man.
I'm just gonna read a lot.

04:50.013 --> 04:52.450
Add this to the stack.

05:01.803 --> 05:02.939
How's it going, Brownie?
Still running around

05:02.939 --> 05:05.377
being a shitass out there?

05:05.377 --> 05:09.653
You know how it is.
Rockin', rollin'.

05:09.653 --> 05:12.659
You know, man,
you could've been something.

05:12.659 --> 05:14.028
You weren't a bad tackle.

05:14.028 --> 05:18.571
Yeah, well, football, school...

05:18.571 --> 05:20.575
- just isn't for me, Coach.
- Hmm.

05:20.575 --> 05:22.411
Too many rules.

05:22.411 --> 05:24.716
Hell, man, you know how much
freedom you have right now?

05:24.716 --> 05:26.787
You're young.
There are no rules.

05:26.787 --> 05:28.089
Shit, wait till you grow up.

05:28.089 --> 05:29.826
That's when they
lay the rules on thick.

05:29.826 --> 05:31.563
You break those rules,
you get thrown in jail.

05:31.563 --> 05:33.734
Here you just get a couple
lickings from a clipboard.

05:33.734 --> 05:34.903
What you know about licking,
Coach?

05:34.903 --> 05:35.972
Irene.

05:35.972 --> 05:37.809
Sorry.

05:37.809 --> 05:38.844
Wait'll you see the rules
they have in jail.

05:38.844 --> 05:41.049
You ain't gonna like it one bit.

05:41.049 --> 05:42.919
Just you wait, Brownie,
You're gonna think of me

05:42.919 --> 05:45.592
when you're in
McAlester Maximum Security

05:45.592 --> 05:47.461
getting slapped around
by some big <i>stehekti</i> guy.

05:47.461 --> 05:51.402
- Ah, well, I'm glad you believe
in me, Coach.
- Mm.

05:52.572 --> 05:54.743
Is that marijuana
I smell in here?

05:54.743 --> 05:57.414
No, that's, uh... That's cedar.

05:57.414 --> 05:58.884
What kind of Indian are you?

05:58.884 --> 06:01.557
You don't know
the smell of cedar?

06:01.557 --> 06:03.126
Sheesh. Cedar? Yeah, right.

06:03.126 --> 06:05.565
Scout's honor.

06:05.565 --> 06:07.936
All right, y'all,
you have a good summer.

06:07.936 --> 06:09.404
You take care of yourself, Brownie.

06:11.008 --> 06:13.680
You little shitass, you.
Look, look.

06:17.589 --> 06:19.425
Dang, I thought he was never
gonna leave.

06:19.425 --> 06:20.561
Let's go, then.

06:20.561 --> 06:24.468
Quit slamming my doors.

06:24.468 --> 06:26.973
Holy shit, what is this?

06:28.544 --> 06:30.013
You're the one who broke
that one.

06:34.723 --> 06:37.629
<i>♪ Tonight there's gonna be
a jailbreak... ♪</i>

06:37.629 --> 06:40.167
You really dropped the ball
on this one, man.

06:40.167 --> 06:42.739
We could've been on
the moon right now.

06:42.739 --> 06:45.611
Yeah?
Well, why didn't you get us any?

06:45.611 --> 06:48.751
Because you said you'd get it.
Acting all big. Ooh!

06:48.751 --> 06:50.655
You know, last time I recall,

06:50.655 --> 06:53.026
you were the only person
that wasn't in school, Brownie.

06:53.026 --> 06:57.067
Hey, last time I remember,
you had one job.

06:58.804 --> 07:02.679
I think it's my favorite drug

07:02.679 --> 07:04.015
of them all.

07:04.015 --> 07:05.551
Aho.

07:05.551 --> 07:06.887
I think you do too much of it.

07:06.887 --> 07:08.890
- True.
- Mm-hmm.

07:10.260 --> 07:12.231
Hey, there's Fixico.

07:12.231 --> 07:14.034
I'll ask him.

07:16.205 --> 07:18.644
No. No, no, no. No.
You don't have to do that.

07:18.644 --> 07:20.648
- What?
- You still mad at him?

07:20.648 --> 07:22.686
No, I just--

07:22.686 --> 07:25.057
I just think we can
get it somewhere else.

07:25.057 --> 07:26.927
- I know a few people.
- This is all your fault.

07:26.927 --> 07:29.700
It's my fault?
I'm just doing my own thing.

07:29.700 --> 07:30.802
This is all them.

07:30.802 --> 07:32.672
Brownie.

07:34.576 --> 07:37.214
Fixico, my brother.

07:37.214 --> 07:39.218
Hey, what's up, Brownie?

07:39.218 --> 07:40.955
My cousin up there?

07:40.955 --> 07:43.093
Oh, yeah.

07:43.093 --> 07:44.696
He still mad at me?

07:44.696 --> 07:45.998
You know Chebon.

07:45.998 --> 07:48.537
Acts white sometimes,
holds grudges.

07:48.537 --> 07:52.044
Oh, man, this has been
a long one.

07:52.044 --> 07:54.816
Say. Windowpane.
You got any?

07:54.816 --> 07:56.954
Trying to score some here
in a bit.

07:56.954 --> 07:58.791
That and a couple of lids.

07:58.791 --> 08:00.695
- Meet me at the river?
- Of course.

08:00.695 --> 08:02.131
Bitchin'. My brother.

08:02.131 --> 08:03.968
- All right.
- Be right back.

08:05.805 --> 08:07.742
- He's doing it?
- Yeah. Give me the money.

08:07.742 --> 08:09.813
- You have any cash, Chebon?
- For what?

08:09.813 --> 08:11.249
You dropped the ball.
Cough it up.

08:11.249 --> 08:13.821
Not for Fixico.

08:13.821 --> 08:15.825
Come on.

08:15.825 --> 08:18.129
Hurry up. Quit being cheap.

08:18.129 --> 08:21.135
Okay, fine. For Mabel.

08:21.135 --> 08:23.974
- For Mabel.
- There you go.

08:23.974 --> 08:26.245
Hear that, Mabel?

08:26.245 --> 08:28.016
All snagged up.

08:28.016 --> 08:30.687
You need to stop frowning.
You're gonna get wrinkles.

08:32.257 --> 08:33.994
Tell me what you told me yesterday.

08:33.994 --> 08:36.567
- What?
- About the sunset.

08:36.567 --> 08:37.969
Oh, about golden hour?

08:37.969 --> 08:39.237
Mm-hmm.

08:40.641 --> 08:43.747
Well, um, golden hour is

08:43.747 --> 08:45.751
kind of a function

08:45.751 --> 08:48.123
of the Earth's axial tilt,
such that twice a day

08:48.123 --> 08:51.028
you get this soft light.

08:51.028 --> 08:54.201
And, um, when the brightness
of the natural light

08:54.201 --> 08:56.640
from the sky perfectly matches
the light that

08:56.640 --> 08:58.878
we've made here on the land,

08:58.878 --> 09:01.249
that is when you get
your golden hour.

09:01.249 --> 09:04.656
Chebon, you talk funny.

09:04.656 --> 09:06.125

09:59.900 --> 10:02.337
And me and him dated
a month ago for, like, a week.

10:02.337 --> 10:05.143
Yeah, I'm not mad
about you and him.

10:05.143 --> 10:07.381

but it's not why.

10:07.381 --> 10:08.717

10:08.717 --> 10:10.988
Uh, I don't want
to talk about it.

10:10.988 --> 10:14.228
- Come on.
- No, um, you don't want to know.

10:14.228 --> 10:16.432
I do.

10:16.432 --> 10:18.704
It's just family shit.

10:18.704 --> 10:22.243
I mean, he's said some stuff
that's hard to take back.

10:23.145 --> 10:25.283
You know, he's always
looked down on me.

10:25.283 --> 10:28.857
Well, not down but sideways.

10:30.460 --> 10:33.433
You know he's being trained
to do medicine?

10:33.433 --> 10:36.105
So? That's a good thing.
What's wrong with that?

10:36.105 --> 10:38.142
Nothing. It's just...

10:39.311 --> 10:42.117
I don't know. Um...

10:42.117 --> 10:44.856
To being young and <i>indigimenis.</i>

10:44.856 --> 10:47.160
He just...

10:47.160 --> 10:48.864
He's always had things.

10:48.864 --> 10:52.137
Everything has just been
paved for him.

10:52.137 --> 10:56.279
Like... he has his parents,
and I don't.

10:56.279 --> 10:58.283
And it's not that
he has these things

10:58.283 --> 11:00.922
that make me angry or mad,
it's just that

11:00.922 --> 11:05.162
he doesn't acknowledge that
I don't have those things.

11:07.334 --> 11:10.340
So that's, um, my thing.

11:10.340 --> 11:13.279
Oh, and, um, now that he
has those medicine ways,

11:13.279 --> 11:16.451
people treat him like
a goddamn pope.

11:17.788 --> 11:19.725

11:20.527 --> 11:23.166
I don't know.
When we were younger,

11:23.166 --> 11:27.174
we were just two shitasses
running around barefoot.

11:28.777 --> 11:32.150
Yeah, but...
you know, things change.

11:34.121 --> 11:36.225
Anyway, that's why
we got into it.

11:36.225 --> 11:38.262
He thought it was over
some bullshit,

11:38.262 --> 11:42.972
but apparently I was
holding some stuff in.

11:42.972 --> 11:44.875
Mm.

11:47.380 --> 11:48.750

11:50.821 --> 11:51.956

11:54.227 --> 11:58.202

just been welding.

12:34.843 --> 12:36.178
Pipelining.

Get to travel around.

12:38.917 --> 12:41.523

12:41.523 --> 12:45.163
That's your dream?
To be a welder?

12:45.163 --> 12:47.401
Figured if I save up
enough money,

12:47.401 --> 12:49.038
I can start my own dojo.

12:49.038 --> 12:52.110

12:52.110 --> 12:53.580

12:53.580 --> 12:55.551
I'm gonna join AIM.

12:55.551 --> 12:57.387

12:57.387 --> 12:59.191
Yeah, right. You wanna snag
one of them northern boys

12:59.191 --> 13:00.260

13:02.598 --> 13:04.168

13:04.168 --> 13:06.205
I want to raise
little Indian babies.

13:06.205 --> 13:08.309

Better one than mine.

13:08.309 --> 13:10.146
You hear that, Maxi-pad?

13:10.146 --> 13:11.348
Better start getting busy.

13:11.348 --> 13:14.054
- Shut up.
- I want kids, you know.

13:14.054 --> 13:15.925
I want a big family.

13:15.925 --> 13:18.162
Were you thinking

13:18.162 --> 13:20.033
I want to be a scientist.

13:20.033 --> 13:21.335

13:21.335 --> 13:22.872
Ho-ah.

13:22.872 --> 13:24.341

13:24.341 --> 13:26.278
What do you want to be
when you're older?

13:27.915 --> 13:29.518
I don't know.

13:31.455 --> 13:33.560
Make movies or something.

13:33.560 --> 13:35.898
Like, you guys remember
that <i>Rollerball</i> movie

13:35.898 --> 13:38.904
where they showed what games
would look like in the future?

13:38.904 --> 13:41.242
I was thinking about stickball.

13:41.242 --> 13:45.550
Like, making a futuristic
stickball movie.

13:50.193 --> 13:53.199
You ain't gonna make
no fucking movie!

13:53.199 --> 13:56.038

You gonna move to Hollywood?
