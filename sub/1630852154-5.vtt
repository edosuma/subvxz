it should be fine.

invented the lightning rod
in the 1750s,

16:46.800 --> 16:49.633
while he was doing his famous
experiments with electricity.

16:49.767 --> 16:52.133
He correctly predicted the rods
would help protect buildings

16:52.266 --> 16:55.500
from the awesome power of these
electrical bolts from the sky.

16:55.633 --> 16:58.467
As they grew in popularity,
new designs emerged

16:58.600 --> 17:00.166
and glass balls were added

17:00.300 --> 17:02.400
to make them more aesthetically
pleasing.

17:02.533 --> 17:04.834
Some of the most ornate and
rare examples of these rods

17:04.967 --> 17:07.133
can fetch thousands of dollars
at auction.

17:09.533 --> 17:11.200
Ted: Hurry up,
I don't want any lightning.

17:11.333 --> 17:13.600
Lightning rods are a little
tricky to pull off the roof

17:13.734 --> 17:17.233
with a machine. One wrong move
and they'll tumble and shatter.

17:17.367 --> 17:19.567
(Crumbling)

17:19.700 --> 17:21.500
Narrator: Justin strips
the building's exterior,

17:21.633 --> 17:23.567
to use it as a ramp
to get the height he needs

17:23.700 --> 17:25.800
to try and save
the lightning rods.

17:29.367 --> 17:31.700
Justin: This building
is built well.

17:31.834 --> 17:33.834
It doesn't just want to give.

17:36.900 --> 17:38.867
If it was a standard house,

17:39.000 --> 17:41.367
I'd just flop it over and
cut the lightning rods off.

17:43.900 --> 17:45.467
- Yo! Yo!

17:45.600 --> 17:47.867
- These lightning rods are not
going to happen.

17:49.066 --> 17:51.200
Ted: I think you can get those
lightning rods off.

17:51.333 --> 17:54.500
Maybe if you grab that corner
and just pull that right down.

17:54.633 --> 17:56.633
Justin: Well then,
I make a mess.

17:56.767 --> 17:59.567
Ted: It's already a mess.
Not your best work.

17:59.700 --> 18:01.633
Justin: I'll make it clean.

18:02.934 --> 18:05.467
There. There's what I want.
There's one and two.

18:05.600 --> 18:07.433
It should fall this way.

18:07.567 --> 18:09.967
Ted would like you very much.
This is hard.

18:10.100 --> 18:11.700
Oh, ho, ho.

18:11.834 --> 18:13.734
Come on, baby. Come on!

18:14.800 --> 18:17.266
(Clatters)
Ahh!

18:21.867 --> 18:23.533
♪

18:23.667 --> 18:25.300
Justin: There's what I want.

18:25.433 --> 18:27.500
There's one and two.
It should fall this way. Oh.

18:29.533 --> 18:32.033
Come on, baby. Come on.

18:34.800 --> 18:36.567
(Clatters)
Ahhh!

18:37.934 --> 18:40.600
Hey, do you think
that ball broke?

18:40.734 --> 18:42.500
Ted: Yeah, it broke.
I saw it smash.

18:42.633 --> 18:45.166
- Ah! They're the worst things
in the world to save.

18:45.300 --> 18:47.133
So I've got to lower the whole
damn roof

18:47.266 --> 18:49.367
and it's a messy building.
What are these worth, like--

18:49.500 --> 18:52.066
- That's about a $400 one.
- Really?

18:52.200 --> 18:54.934
- That glass is stellar on
that. See if you can just

18:55.066 --> 18:57.333
lower this piece down,
then we'll try for the other.

18:57.467 --> 18:59.500
- So the bet is for one?
- If we get one off.

18:59.633 --> 19:01.734
- Let me, let me keep going.

19:01.867 --> 19:04.033
I'll grab that corner
of that roof

19:04.166 --> 19:05.800
and I'll flop the whole
corner over.

19:05.934 --> 19:07.200
- Alright.
Justin: Zero for one.

19:07.333 --> 19:09.600
Attempt number two,
I'm going to try to pull down

19:09.734 --> 19:12.533
the whole side of the building
and gently guide this rod down.

19:12.667 --> 19:14.233
Hopefully that works.

19:14.367 --> 19:16.367
- The glass is what blows up
if the lightning hits it.

19:16.500 --> 19:18.867
Brandon: Oh, really?
Justin: Come on.

19:20.400 --> 19:21.900
Oh no.

19:22.033 --> 19:24.133
Oh, that wire!

19:24.266 --> 19:26.333
Don't play with me, wire.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.033
Ahh! You don't like me.

19:32.900 --> 19:34.934
Ahh! Stop it!

19:35.066 --> 19:36.900
Ted: Got it.

19:39.400 --> 19:41.033
Justin: Success!
Ted: See?

19:41.166 --> 19:42.700
- That doesn't count.

19:42.834 --> 19:44.400
Ted: What are you talking
about?

19:44.533 --> 19:46.033
- I've never really touched one
of them.

19:46.166 --> 19:48.467
They've always broken. Beauty.
Ted: That's a nice one, eh?

19:48.600 --> 19:50.900
- That's gorgeous.
You guys, get out of the way,

19:51.033 --> 19:52.467
let me keep going!

19:54.667 --> 19:56.667
There's one right here.
Do you want to cut this one?

19:56.800 --> 19:58.800
Ted: He had a lot easier time
with the second one.

19:58.934 --> 20:00.767
Two out of three is not bad.

20:00.900 --> 20:03.100
It's a win/win.
I won the bet,

20:03.233 --> 20:05.133
and I get to sell these
beautiful pieces.

20:05.266 --> 20:07.000
We've got to hit the road.

20:07.133 --> 20:08.567
Justin: I'll clean it all up.
Ted: Okay.

We've got a lot of real estate
here, eh?

20:59.900 --> 21:02.000
Brandon: Yeah, it looks
massive. Where do we start?

21:02.133 --> 21:03.734
Ted: Let's start here.
Brandon: Start here?

21:03.867 --> 21:05.100
Ted: Yeah, this looks
like the tavern.

21:05.233 --> 21:06.834
- Okay, I'll follow you in.

21:06.967 --> 21:08.867
Ted: I have zero idea what
is in this tavern.

21:09.000 --> 21:10.600
I've got to get in there,
take a look

21:10.734 --> 21:12.333
and see what's worth salvaging.

21:12.467 --> 21:14.300
Oh wow.

21:15.333 --> 21:17.767
This place is full.
- Oh, this place is full.

21:17.900 --> 21:19.467
Ted: I don't know where
to start here.

21:19.600 --> 21:21.633
(Laughing)
Holy crap.

21:22.734 --> 21:25.500
Under the liquor control act.
That's a cool sign, man.

21:25.633 --> 21:27.200
Hand painted. Beautiful.

21:27.333 --> 21:29.066
Look at those doors.

- Oh, you're going
to get those off, eh?

21:30.734 --> 21:32.467
- Oh yeah, man, look at them.
The walk-in cooler, eh.

21:32.600 --> 21:35.400
These doors are in fantastic
condition.

21:35.533 --> 21:38.600
Could be $400 to $500 a piece,
we're two or three grand.

Oh man. Yeah, I like that.

21:40.734 --> 21:42.800

I like those.
Men and women.

21:44.934 --> 21:47.066
I like that base,
this is a cool table.

21:47.200 --> 21:50.000
In these small towns,
the local tavern

21:50.133 --> 21:52.834
was the hub for all the
recreational activities,

21:52.967 --> 21:56.734
which usually included
drinking, music and fighting.

21:56.867 --> 21:58.300

the jukebox.

That's a reproduction.

Ted: It is very cool.

22:05.967 --> 22:07.734
You never know what
you're going to find

22:07.867 --> 22:10.266
and this place proves it.
What a goldmine.

22:10.400 --> 22:12.133
It is loaded with stuff!

22:12.266 --> 22:13.667
Retro, baby.
- What is that?

22:13.800 --> 22:16.066
Ted: It's a pole lamp.
Very cool.

22:16.200 --> 22:18.367
Brandon: Sure.
Ted: Very 50s.

22:18.500 --> 22:20.834
Pole lamps, very popular.

22:20.967 --> 22:24.000
I was not expecting
to find that here at all.

22:24.133 --> 22:26.600
I'm glad I did,
it's $450 bucks.

22:26.734 --> 22:30.133
Oh, look at that shuffleboard
table! Oh, this is big.

22:30.266 --> 22:33.834
Finding shuffleboards is rare,
they're highly collectable.

22:33.967 --> 22:37.033
This one is sweet.
Late 50s, coin operated,

22:38.133 --> 22:39.500
that makes it unique.

22:39.633 --> 22:41.033
Alright, I like this.

22:41.166 --> 22:42.500
We're going to hit 20K

22:42.633 --> 22:44.333
and we haven't even scratched
the surface here.

22:44.467 --> 22:45.934
You see what karma is?

22:46.066 --> 22:48.166
We're going to save everything
for the museum,

22:48.300 --> 22:50.867
good karma, right.
And in turn, we get this.

22:51.000 --> 22:52.934
- And you get to take anything
you want here.

22:53.066 --> 22:54.700

We'll hit the other barn.

Ted: Oh my God, look at it.

22:58.066 --> 23:00.967
Signage, floor grates.
This place is full too.

23:02.033 --> 23:04.200
Look, it says popcorn on
the other side, I like that.

23:05.233 --> 23:06.667
That's a beauty,
that's cool too.

a little storage area?

a lot more stuff up here too.

Check the books for money.

23:43.934 --> 23:45.667

23:45.800 --> 23:47.667
- Yeah, people stash money and
stuff in there.

23:47.800 --> 23:50.066
I've never had it in records
but in books, a lot of times.

23:50.200 --> 23:51.600

them.

CHUM charts,

24:01.266 --> 24:03.166
they were given out
as handouts.

24:03.300 --> 24:05.066
People looked at them,
when the week was up,

24:05.200 --> 24:06.700
they threw them away,
they got a new one.

24:06.834 --> 24:09.033
There was no social media,
there was none of that stuff.

Brandon: Right.
Ted: So, to know the hot songs,

24:11.066 --> 24:13.400
you got this every week, right.
- Are these worth any money?

24:13.533 --> 24:15.266
- Oh, they're collectable,
for sure.

$100 bucks a piece.
