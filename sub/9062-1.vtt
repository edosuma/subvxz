"Get the hell out."

drunk right now,

an extenuating
circumstance, Sergeant.

It's called a war.
It's in Iraq.

37:12.832 --> 37:15.567

I volunteered
to fight in it.

37:15.635 --> 37:19.405
I ran over 150 combat
missions for you,
no complaint.

37:19.472 --> 37:23.242

stop-loss is only
in a time of war.

the war's over,

right by this Army,

you either way.

37:45.031 --> 37:46.365

trumps you in
this matter.

is bullshit,
and you know it!

Sergeant King disobey
a direct order.

Yes, sir.
I also perceive him
to be a flight risk.

38:22.902 --> 38:26.105

the stockade so he
can readjust his attitude.

My name is...
<i>CARLSON: No names.</i>

01:24:34.240 --> 01:24:35.507
<i>All right.</i>
<i>What's the problem?</i>

01:24:37.277 --> 01:24:40.479
I'm a Staff Sergeant,
a squad leader,

01:24:40.547 --> 01:24:44.717
two tours,
Afghanistan and Iraq,
and I just got stop-lossed.

01:24:44.784 --> 01:24:46.885
They're shipping me back
at the end of the month.

01:24:46.953 --> 01:24:49.288

<i>It's the same story,</i>
<i>and you eventually call me.</i>

<i>Do you understand what I do?</i>

01:24:56.363 --> 01:24:59.531
<i>I strip away who you are.</i>
<i>I set you down</i>
<i>in a foreign place</i>

01:24:59.599 --> 01:25:00.799
<i>where you're gonna live</i>
<i>the rest of your life</i>

<i>Do you want that?</i>

01:25:04.237 --> 01:25:07.673
I can't go home.
I can't go back.
I got no other options.

01:25:10.477 --> 01:25:12.845
I need your services.

01:25:12.912 --> 01:25:16.281

<i>Do you have some money?</i>
<i>Like a grand?</i>

01:25:19.819 --> 01:25:21.720
I have a few bucks.

01:25:21.788 --> 01:25:25.157

<i>start driving north</i>
<i>toward New York City.</i>

01:25:32.565 --> 01:25:34.033
Not a bad price.

Thank you, sir.

Come on.
This is a good
opportunity.

01:26:24.584 --> 01:26:27.820
Rainey said that
people will just line up
to buy a Cadillac from a vet.

01:26:27.887 --> 01:26:30.155
Yeah, not with a BCD.

01:26:30.223 --> 01:26:32.991
It's not like you're
gonna hang it on the
showroom wall, Tommy.

01:26:35.061 --> 01:26:36.562

It's a Bad

this shit up, or what?

01:26:54.647 --> 01:26:55.547
That shotgun loaded?

01:26:57.283 --> 01:26:59.551
What's the first rule
of weapon safety, Tommy?

01:26:59.619 --> 01:27:01.987
Always assume
every weapon
is loaded.

01:27:03.189 --> 01:27:04.323
Yes, sir.

01:27:05.325 --> 01:27:06.258

01:27:09.729 --> 01:27:11.096
Where are you going?

01:27:11.164 --> 01:27:13.565
I'm going back
to the bunkhouse,
write a hit song.

I spotted you guys
from a mile off.

01:28:00.213 --> 01:28:00.979
Oh, well.

01:28:02.182 --> 01:28:03.749
What happened?

01:28:03.817 --> 01:28:05.851
I just had a run-in
with a couple guys.

01:28:05.919 --> 01:28:08.921
Yeah.
That kind of shit happens
when you're on the run.

01:28:08.988 --> 01:28:11.523
All you guys get
popped eventually.

01:28:13.326 --> 01:28:14.793
Is this a package deal?

01:28:16.496 --> 01:28:18.330
Just one for now.

01:28:19.666 --> 01:28:20.799
You thought about this?

01:28:20.867 --> 01:28:22.201
Yes, sir.

01:28:22.268 --> 01:28:23.802
'Cause one-way
means one-way.

I just want it all
laid out straight.

01:28:46.026 --> 01:28:48.360
Canada's not that bad.

01:28:48.428 --> 01:28:51.930
I just had a guy up there,
got married to
a real sweet local girl.

01:28:51.998 --> 01:28:53.565
Loves Toronto.

01:28:53.633 --> 01:28:56.301
Says it's a lot
like New York.

01:28:56.369 --> 01:28:58.637
I ain't so crazy
about New York, so far.

01:28:59.939 --> 01:29:01.674
You got any other options?

01:29:01.741 --> 01:29:03.475
Like, what about Mexico?

01:29:03.543 --> 01:29:05.277
Look, I don't know

<i>underneath those grins</i>

01:45:57.023 --> 01:46:00.025
<i># They only waitin' on</i>
<i>their next chance</i>
<i>to try to kill me again</i>

01:46:00.093 --> 01:46:03.395
<i># And don't be caught</i>
<i>thinking out here</i>
<i>that your chances are slim</i>

01:46:03.463 --> 01:46:06.598
<i># 'Cause there are those</i>
<i>who have thought it</i>
<i>who will never think again</i>

01:46:06.666 --> 01:46:09.768
<i># 'Cause we're alone</i>
<i>in this country</i>
<i>140,000 friends</i>

01:46:09.836 --> 01:46:12.871
<i># And some 20-odd million</i>
<i>that'd see us all dead</i>

01:46:12.939 --> 01:46:16.008
<i># You could only imagine</i>
<i>our struggle,</i>
<i>the odds we're against</i>

01:46:16.076 --> 01:46:19.211
<i># And though it once</i>
<i>killed me to kill,</i>
<i>I'd gladly do it again</i>

01:46:19.279 --> 01:46:22.381
<i># If only you could</i>
<i>really understand</i>
<i>the state of mind that I'm in</i>

01:46:22.449 --> 01:46:25.551
<i># Only then could you feel me,</i>
<i>only then would I make sense</i>

01:46:25.618 --> 01:46:28.487
<i># If only I hadn't have been</i>
<i>to some of the places</i>
<i>I've been</i>

01:46:28.555 --> 01:46:31.824
<i># If only I wouldn't</i>
<i>have seen what I saw,</i>
<i>maybe I could feel again</i>

01:46:31.891 --> 01:46:34.993
<i># But it's too hard</i>
<i>to separate</i>
<i>what's goin' on within me</i>

01:46:35.061 --> 01:46:38.163
<i># It's just so much easier</i>
<i>to let hate be my remedy</i>

01:46:38.231 --> 01:46:41.400
<i># So for everything</i>
<i>I'm guilty of,</i>
<i>let the Lord sentence me</i>

01:46:41.468 --> 01:46:44.503
<i># If only I wouldn't</i>
<i>have let everything</i>
<i>I been through get to me</i>

01:46:44.571 --> 01:46:47.639
<i># Things could've</i>
<i>been different,</i>
<i>but that is not my reality</i>

01:46:47.707 --> 01:46:51.007
<i># And either way,</i>
<i>it's only a matter of time</i>
<i>before I'm outta here #</i>
