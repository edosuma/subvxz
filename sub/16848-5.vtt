Childrens Hospital:

00:03.700 --> 00:06.267
You can't be sleeping
with this patient. He's only 6.

00:06.300 --> 00:09.300
He has Advanced Aging Disease.
It's just not right.

00:12.567 --> 00:14.767
I was kidding.

00:14.800 --> 00:16.800
Oh, my God.

00:16.833 --> 00:19.433
Seriously, you kids have fun.

00:25.700 --> 00:27.767
That's it. This kid's
getting a vasectomy.

00:27.800 --> 00:29.333
No, don't.

00:34.800 --> 00:37.333
Excuse me.

00:37.367 --> 00:39.733
No, I didn't fart.
I just have to get by.

00:42.533 --> 00:44.700
There aren't stairs there.

00:44.733 --> 00:46.033
Damn it.

00:55.067 --> 00:58.267
-Nut-cutters.
-Do you mean the scalpel?

00:58.300 --> 01:01.733
I'm not going to give it to you.
Call it by its right name.

01:01.767 --> 01:04.733
Fine. Scalpel.
Thank you for the nut-cutters.

01:07.533 --> 01:09.100
Dr. Richie,
it look's like

01:09.133 --> 01:10.767
you're giving
this 6-year-old boy a vasectomy.

01:10.800 --> 01:13.067
Well...

01:13.067 --> 01:15.367
...I'm not.

01:15.400 --> 01:16.700
Sperm-tube slicer?

01:16.733 --> 01:19.333
Oh, no.
I can't be party to this.

01:21.333 --> 01:23.633
Fine, I'll do it myself.

01:29.267 --> 01:31.167
Where do I put this shit?

01:31.200 --> 01:33.733
Hey, Lola. Can I talk
to you for a second?

01:33.767 --> 01:37.200
Make it quick. I took an Ambien
and it's about to kick in.

01:37.233 --> 01:39.067
I know you don't
have a tumor.

01:39.067 --> 01:42.300
You were just claiming you did
in order to break up with Owen.

01:42.333 --> 01:46.500
Thank God that someone gets it.
Blake, thank you.

01:46.533 --> 01:48.667
I wanna operate
on your nonexistent tumor.

01:48.700 --> 01:50.733
-Oh, God.
-No, hear me out.

01:50.767 --> 01:52.367
I challenged
the new clown doctor

01:52.400 --> 01:54.133
to a
healing-power-of-laughter-off.

01:54.167 --> 01:58.067
Now, if I operate on your fake
tumor, I'm bound to win.

01:59.167 --> 02:01.600
No. It's stupid.

02:04.200 --> 02:07.433
-Ambien. It's kicking in.
-What?

02:10.400 --> 02:12.233
Attention, staff.

02:12.267 --> 02:16.067
The heavyweight champion
of the world, Rocky Balboa.

02:16.100 --> 02:19.133
What? You wanna go to the O.R.?
Okay, I'll take you.

02:19.167 --> 02:22.700
Webster's Dictionary
defines love

02:22.733 --> 02:25.167
as "A roof lantern or turret...

02:25.200 --> 02:28.233
...often with slatted apertures
for escape or smoke...

02:28.267 --> 02:31.200
...or admission of light
in a medieval building."

02:38.433 --> 02:41.400
-God, what's wrong?
-This is all your fault.

02:41.433 --> 02:44.067
Your ex-boyfriend just gave
my 6-year-old son, Nicky,

02:44.067 --> 02:45.333
a vasectomy.

02:45.367 --> 02:47.533
Josh Brolin gave
your son a vasectomy?

02:47.567 --> 02:49.433
No, Dr. Richie.

02:49.467 --> 02:52.167
That makes more sense.
Josh isn't licensed to practice.

02:52.200 --> 02:53.400
-Dr. Black.
-That I know.

02:53.433 --> 02:55.467
-Dr. Black!
-Okay! God.

02:55.500 --> 02:57.567
The answer to your question
is yes.

02:57.600 --> 02:59.633
I dated Josh Brolin.

03:01.833 --> 03:04.133
-Oh, don't be so dramatic.
-I'm not.

03:04.167 --> 03:06.767
I've been really sick lately,
mainly in the mornings...

03:06.800 --> 03:08.400
...in between really
weird food cravings,

03:08.433 --> 03:10.433
ever since I had sex
with your son.

03:10.467 --> 03:13.233
-Sex with my son?
-What, you prefer I have sex...

03:13.267 --> 03:14.633
...near your son?

03:14.667 --> 03:17.700
I don't see what the big deal is
having sex with him.

03:17.733 --> 03:20.300
It's not about the preposition.

03:21.067 --> 03:22.633
Oh, no.

03:22.667 --> 03:24.700
Ever since I had sex
with your son,

03:24.733 --> 03:26.633
I haven't been feeling right.

03:26.667 --> 03:28.767
I hope I'm not...

03:30.833 --> 03:33.467
...sick with something
your son gave me.

03:36.433 --> 03:39.067
No, it's true, though.
Zach Braff has a tiny penis.

03:39.067 --> 03:41.467
-A colored hooker told me. Yeah.
-What?

03:41.500 --> 03:44.200
Isn't it about time we operated
on your neurological

03:44.233 --> 03:45.467
and muscular disorders?

03:45.500 --> 03:46.633
Right.

03:46.667 --> 03:48.700
Hey, you guys,
I think you should know,

03:48.733 --> 03:52.200
I've decided to let
Dr. von Sydow cure me.

03:52.233 --> 03:53.600
-Of what?
-Wish me luck.

03:53.633 --> 03:56.567
Blake will be in charge
while I'm recovering.

03:56.600 --> 03:58.500
Hey, wait a minute,
where is Blake?

03:58.533 --> 04:00.133
Hey.

04:00.167 --> 04:01.767
Blake is operating
on Lola's brain tumor

04:01.800 --> 04:03.600
using only the healing
power of laughter.

04:03.633 --> 04:06.600
Two crazy operations
at once? Let's go!

04:08.367 --> 04:10.133
Hurry, everybody.

04:10.167 --> 04:12.400
Hurry.

Previously on

04:30.133 --> 04:31.767
I wanna operate
on your nonexistent tumor.

04:33.600 --> 04:36.400
What? You wanna go to the O.R.?
I'll take you.

04:36.433 --> 04:38.267
Blake is operating
on Lola's brain tumor

04:38.300 --> 04:40.100

Two crazy operations

04:45.067 --> 04:47.200
Well, Lola, this is it.

04:47.233 --> 04:48.667
When we return to this spot,

04:48.700 --> 04:51.333
we will be two
very different people.

04:51.367 --> 04:52.733
Punch it in.

04:54.267 --> 04:56.267
Max? Could I
get a little help here?

04:56.300 --> 04:58.300
-Oh, yeah.
-I wanna punch it in.

04:58.333 --> 05:01.567
Let's just kind of let that
sort of ungnarl for a second.

05:01.600 --> 05:05.167
-Pull it. Okay. There you go.
-Yes.

05:05.200 --> 05:07.200
-Okay. It doesn't really--
-Does this--?

05:07.233 --> 05:08.600
-Yeah, that doesn't bend.
-Okay.

05:08.633 --> 05:10.267
-That's good enough.
-Alright.

05:10.300 --> 05:12.600
Okay, punch it in.

05:12.633 --> 05:14.400
-Oh, yeah.
-Oh, okay. Blake?

05:14.433 --> 05:17.400
-Could I get a little help here?
-Of course. Of course.

05:17.433 --> 05:20.333
-Just get it-- Here we go. Good.
-That....

05:20.367 --> 05:21.700
-Yeah.
-Alright.

Andy Dick did comedy?

Suture the central line

-Seventy-four.

05:49.733 --> 05:52.633
-Doctor, code brown.
-I see it.

05:52.667 --> 05:55.233
-Claudicate the distal cavity.
-But that's so risky.

05:55.267 --> 05:57.400
Claudicate it now.

05:58.700 --> 06:02.067
It worked.
I thought you were gay.

Ukulele.

06:11.233 --> 06:14.100
Oh, man, it's getting funny
in here.

06:24.333 --> 06:26.233
That's it. Close her up.

06:28.667 --> 06:33.500
Ladies and gentlemen, I give
you the new and improved Chief.

06:39.167 --> 06:41.100
Wait.

06:41.133 --> 06:44.133
-What happened to her curves?
-What are you--?

06:44.167 --> 06:46.067
Look at these curves.

06:46.067 --> 06:48.500
The curves in her spine,
you idiot.

06:48.533 --> 06:51.600
Yeah. Where's her one big shoe?

06:51.633 --> 06:53.800
Alright, listen up.
I haven't changed.

06:53.833 --> 06:55.633
My insides are still
as differently abled

06:55.667 --> 06:57.267
as my body used to be.

06:57.300 --> 06:59.267
I'm still chief.
I'm still in charge.

06:59.300 --> 07:01.700
He didn't fix my handicapped
vagina, so that's still weird.

07:01.733 --> 07:03.467
-Awesome.
-Cool.

07:03.500 --> 07:06.300
Let's turn our attention to the
real success story of today...

07:06.333 --> 07:08.067
...Dr. Lola Spratt's
brain tumor.

07:08.100 --> 07:10.133
-Blake?
-Okay, I....

07:10.167 --> 07:11.633
I did extract the brain tumor

07:11.667 --> 07:13.467
using only the healing
power of laughter...

07:13.500 --> 07:17.400
...so that was a success.

07:17.433 --> 07:19.200
And she died.

07:19.233 --> 07:21.067
Yeah. Sorry.

07:21.100 --> 07:26.267
But look, look, look, I wielded
the healing power of laughter.

07:26.300 --> 07:28.433
It had had a profound effect
on someone.

07:28.467 --> 07:31.433
I mean, yes, granted, not
the effect I would've wanted,

07:31.467 --> 07:33.767
quite the opposite, but...

07:33.800 --> 07:35.433
...I'm getting there.

07:35.467 --> 07:37.100
Which is why I wanna announce

07:37.133 --> 07:38.700
that I am leaving
Childrens Hospital.

07:38.733 --> 07:43.467
I'm going to start
my own private practice.

07:43.500 --> 07:49.600
You'd say I'm headed for a bit
of a nervous Blake Downs, M.D.

07:49.633 --> 07:51.067
Coming this fall.

07:51.067 --> 07:53.067
Blake Downs, M.D.
COMING THIS FALL

07:55.367 --> 07:56.467
So goodbye.

08:00.200 --> 08:02.300
Life.

08:02.333 --> 08:03.767
I wish there was another word

08:03.800 --> 08:06.600
for what life becomes
when it's over.

08:06.633 --> 08:10.067
We have so little time.

08:10.100 --> 08:12.367
So we cry.

08:13.533 --> 08:15.767
And we love.

08:18.067 --> 08:19.133
No.

08:19.167 --> 08:21.533
And we eat.

08:23.367 --> 08:26.700
That's gotta be at least
three things we do.

08:26.733 --> 08:31.067
How can we possibly find the
time to do anything else?

08:31.833 --> 08:33.232
LOLA SPRATT MD

08:56.200 --> 08:59.567
Thank you for watching these..
The last two episodes

08:59.600 --> 09:02.367
of Childrens Hospital
The Web Series.

09:02.400 --> 09:05.067
Um, now as sort
of a retrospective

09:05.100 --> 09:08.433
I would love to look back
at the series as a whole

09:08.467 --> 09:12.433
and sort of show you some
of my favourite clips

09:12.467 --> 09:13.800
from the season.

09:13.833 --> 09:15.433
I think..

09:15.467 --> 09:18.267
I think you're gonna enjoy them
as much as I did.

09:24.633 --> 09:27.067
I once cured a case
of Lou Gehrig's Disease

09:27.067 --> 09:29.067
by pretending I was trapped
inside a box?

09:29.100 --> 09:32.200
Used to be fixed fuel pumpies in
the healing power of laughter.

09:32.233 --> 09:33.700
I did extract the brain tumor

09:33.733 --> 09:35.533
using only the healing power
of laughter.

09:35.567 --> 09:36.767
So that was a success.

09:36.800 --> 09:38.667
There once was a man
from Nantucket

09:38.700 --> 09:40.600
whose penis was so
abnormally large

09:40.633 --> 09:43.067
that he could reach it
with his own mouth.

09:43.067 --> 09:45.400
Oh! Uh-oh!

09:45.433 --> 09:46.800
What're you talking about?

09:46.833 --> 09:48.767
Prep the OR.
Well, I'm not laughing.

09:48.800 --> 09:50.333
What's up?
