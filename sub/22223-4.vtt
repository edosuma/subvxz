WEBVTT

00:03.296 --> 00:04.706
I finally figured out
wormholes.

00:04.797 --> 00:06.503
I can get you home.

00:06.591 --> 00:09.424
If I knew where home was
or where we are.

00:09.510 --> 00:11.091
You might not wanna
come with us.

00:11.179 --> 00:13.215
We are not the best
traveling companions.

00:13.306 --> 00:15.922
Aeryn we haven't heard from.
Has she contacted you?

00:16.017 --> 00:17.257
No, not yet.

00:18.352 --> 00:19.467
(panting)

00:19.562 --> 00:20.802
What do you want from me?

00:20.897 --> 00:24.389
What I want may not be
as bad as you think.

00:25.860 --> 00:29.102
Chiana:
What are you doing?

00:29.197 --> 00:33.486
My interrogations are much
more agreeable than
Scorpius's methods.

00:34.285 --> 00:37.277
He'll never bother you again.

00:37.371 --> 00:38.622
Bury him.

00:40.499 --> 00:48.213
Elack, if we don't find
the strength, it's all
been for nothing.

00:50.885 --> 00:52.625
( screams )

00:52.720 --> 00:59.182
|wi|| find them again and
when I do, they will pay
for this humiliation.

00:59.268 --> 01:02.476
I've said goodbye to everyone.
I can't make any of you stay.

01:02.563 --> 01:09.105
You have more courage,
integrity and honesty than
a dozen Vellas.

01:09.195 --> 01:12.312
And I should have said
that to her.

01:16.327 --> 01:20.036
Sikozu:
So, any response from Moya?
-Not yet.

01:20.122 --> 01:23.580
We are hunted by Peacekeepers,
lost in the Uncharted
Territories

01:23.668 --> 01:25.408
with no purpose in life.

01:25.503 --> 01:28.085
One of us has a purpose.
Don't you, Crichton?

01:28.172 --> 01:30.003
You're right.

01:30.758 --> 01:33.124
I do have a purpose.

01:34.387 --> 01:37.220
And now, on Farscape.

01:41.269 --> 01:44.102
(electrical whirring
and beeping )

01:44.188 --> 01:46.144
No sign of Moya yet?

01:46.232 --> 01:47.642
D'Argo:
Nothing.

01:47.733 --> 01:49.689
No response on the comms.

01:49.777 --> 01:52.860
So, why don't we land?
I am starving.

01:52.947 --> 01:54.733
Isn't that a planet out there?

01:54.824 --> 01:56.280
D'Argo:
Hot and lifeless.

01:56.367 --> 01:57.277
Do you eat rock?

01:57.368 --> 01:58.232
Hmm.

01:58.327 --> 02:00.192
Right now, I think I could.

02:00.288 --> 02:02.779
You ate only three
solar days ago.

02:02.873 --> 02:04.704
How inefficient is your body?

02:04.792 --> 02:09.206
How edible is yours?

02:09.297 --> 02:10.503
I can see there's not
much meat on there,

02:10.589 --> 02:12.170
but I'm sure there's a lot
of chew on your noggin.

02:12.258 --> 02:14.340
( Rygel passes helium )

02:16.554 --> 02:18.636
(helium voice):
Oh, damn.

02:18.723 --> 02:20.679
How do you roll a window down
in this place?

02:20.766 --> 02:22.222
I should have stayed
on the module.

02:22.310 --> 02:24.175
(helium voice):
Should have left him
on the module.

02:24.270 --> 02:27.182
(helium voice):
Oh, I need food!

02:28.274 --> 02:29.639
Crichton:
We all need food, Buckwheat.

02:29.734 --> 02:32.225
You don't hear the rest of us
fumigating the joint.

02:32.320 --> 02:33.400
Here.

02:33.487 --> 02:34.397
What's that?

02:34.488 --> 02:36.103
Jilnak. Very good for you.

02:36.198 --> 02:38.484
Huh?
-Give it to Mikey there.
He'll eat anything.

02:41.537 --> 02:43.152
Oh...

02:43.581 --> 02:44.912
More?

02:44.999 --> 02:47.331
Crichton:
Hey, what do you know?
Mikey likes it.

02:47.418 --> 02:48.874
One portion apiece.

02:48.961 --> 02:51.873
Rygel:
Uh, three stomachs,
three portions, no?

02:55.301 --> 02:57.007
It's not bad.

02:57.261 --> 02:58.341
Mmm.

02:58.429 --> 02:59.714
Mmm.

02:59.805 --> 03:02.592
It's actually quite good.

03:02.683 --> 03:05.425
Crichton:
That stuff's not gonna turn
anybody into a newt, is it?

03:05.519 --> 03:06.304
Eat it.

03:06.395 --> 03:09.057
It's jilnak. Restorative.

03:09.148 --> 03:12.515
Rygel:
Uh, if you don't
want it, |, uh...

03:12.610 --> 03:13.474
Rygel.

03:13.569 --> 03:14.900
Hmm?

03:16.405 --> 03:19.112
Crichton:
How come everything
tastes like chicken?

03:19.200 --> 03:20.986
Chiana:
What's chicken?

03:35.216 --> 03:38.174
(groaning & belching)

03:38.260 --> 03:39.841
I'll be back.

03:39.929 --> 03:40.918
(groaning)

03:41.013 --> 03:43.720
Don't you leave without me.

03:43.808 --> 03:45.469
(groaning)

03:52.441 --> 03:54.102
Oh...

03:58.197 --> 04:00.529
(stomach gurgling)

04:01.200 --> 04:02.565
Hmm...

04:03.744 --> 04:05.075
( retching )

04:08.416 --> 04:10.327
( retching )

04:15.256 --> 04:17.338
( retching )

04:21.429 --> 04:24.171
Crichton:
Restorative? You call
that a restorative?

04:24.265 --> 04:25.755
Try "purgative."

04:25.850 --> 04:26.464
Here.

04:26.559 --> 04:27.924
This'll help the cramp.

04:28.018 --> 04:30.270
You better get away from me
before I spew on you.

04:30.354 --> 04:32.561
lam inside out.

04:32.648 --> 04:34.229
But you're not hungry anymore.

04:34.316 --> 04:35.726
( hisses )

04:37.903 --> 04:39.814
Okay, where's Rygel?

04:39.905 --> 04:43.193
Down that hole, taking
a giant slok.

04:44.368 --> 04:45.904
Rygel?

04:45.995 --> 04:47.155
( retches )

04:47.246 --> 04:49.157
Buckwheat?

04:49.248 --> 04:50.613
Rygel?

04:54.962 --> 04:56.998
Hey, Sparky!

04:57.089 --> 04:58.374
You down there?

04:58.466 --> 04:59.376
Rygel?!

04:59.467 --> 05:00.627
Guido?!

05:03.804 --> 05:06.671
(stomach gurgling, groaning)

05:11.353 --> 05:14.937
Crichton:
Man, I got one of those chunks
stuck up in my nose.

05:15.024 --> 05:16.184
D'Argo:
I hate that.

05:16.275 --> 05:18.482
Rygel, what the frell
are you doing?

05:18.569 --> 05:21.936
Buckwheat, I thought you came
down here to drop some friends
off at the pool.

05:22.031 --> 05:23.737
I did... I will.

05:23.824 --> 05:25.815
Crichton:
Well, do your business and
let's get out of here.

05:25.910 --> 05:28.242
And that stuff belongs to
somebody else.

05:28.329 --> 05:32.117
D'Argo:
We have enough enemies already.

05:32.208 --> 05:34.665
I thought you said the
planet's lifeless.

05:34.752 --> 05:37.118
On the surface, yes.
But down here...

05:37.213 --> 05:39.420
What's this? Medicines.

05:39.507 --> 05:41.543
Crichton:
Oh, great. Another klepto.

05:41.634 --> 05:43.841
No, no, no, no, no.
These markings are familiar.

05:43.928 --> 05:45.668
I've seen them before
somewhere, but where?

05:45.763 --> 05:47.924
D'Argo:
Who cares?
Let's get out of here.

05:48.015 --> 05:49.255
Crichton:
Exactly.

05:49.350 --> 05:51.136
( sniffs )

05:54.396 --> 05:56.102
Help!

05:56.190 --> 05:58.021
(electrical whirring )

06:00.027 --> 06:02.018
Watch it. Trip lights
everywhere. D.

06:02.112 --> 06:03.318
I know, I see them.

06:03.405 --> 06:05.782
No! Uh-uh, uh-uh. Booby traps.

06:05.866 --> 06:07.242
Rygel:
I can't move.

06:07.326 --> 06:08.816
Help me. Get me out.

06:08.911 --> 06:11.152
D'Argo! Crichton! Will someone
frelling answer me?

06:11.872 --> 06:13.203
D'Argo:
Stand clear.

06:18.254 --> 06:19.164
It's no good.

06:19.255 --> 06:20.836
Rygel:
Somebody help me.

06:20.923 --> 06:22.288
I'm stuck.

06:23.092 --> 06:24.548
We're all stuck.

06:29.056 --> 06:32.969
My name is John Crichton,
an astronaut.

06:33.060 --> 06:36.552
Three years ago I got shot
through a wormhole.

06:36.647 --> 06:38.433
I'm in a distant part
of the universe

06:38.524 --> 06:41.687
aboard this living ship of
escaped prisoners,

06:41.777 --> 06:43.517
my friends.

06:44.613 --> 06:46.399
I've made enemies.

06:46.490 --> 06:49.732
Powerful, dangerous.

06:49.827 --> 06:53.319
Now all I want is to
find a way home

06:53.414 --> 06:56.156
to warn Earth.

06:56.250 --> 07:01.370
Look upward and share
the wonders I've seen.

07:31.201 --> 07:34.193
Rygel (straining ):
Oh, I really need to slok.

07:34.288 --> 07:37.746
My bowels hate me. I hate you.

07:37.833 --> 07:40.245
Get me out! Do something!

07:40.336 --> 07:41.496
I'm open to suggestions.

07:41.587 --> 07:43.794
Where have I seen these
markings before?

07:43.881 --> 07:45.166
On Cavari? Yes.

07:45.257 --> 07:47.122
No, no, not Cavari.
It must have been Eldor Two.

07:47.217 --> 07:49.048
D, we may have to stick
Granny in a home.

07:49.136 --> 07:50.717
I think we should burn her.

07:50.804 --> 07:52.260
You burn your old folks?

07:52.348 --> 07:54.680
D'Argo:
No, just sounded like
a good idea.

07:54.767 --> 07:57.133
( clanging )
Wait, you hear that?

07:57.227 --> 08:00.310
(air hissing)

08:01.357 --> 08:02.847
( Rygel groans)

08:02.941 --> 08:04.226
Sparky, shut up.

08:04.318 --> 08:07.526
(voices in the distance)
Stop your whingeing, will ya?

08:07.613 --> 08:10.229
Don't forget to kill the traps.

08:10.324 --> 08:13.111
No, course not. Traps are off.

08:13.202 --> 08:15.534
Sloggard:
I don't know why they make us
set the traps the first place!

08:15.621 --> 08:18.078
Rygel.
-Plague. Children sick, dying.

08:18.165 --> 08:19.996
Then soldiers brought
provisions.

08:20.084 --> 08:21.824
Come on, Frool! Get...

08:21.919 --> 08:24.331
Tarkans! These belong
to the Tarkans.
-Yo, Grandma! Come on! Go!

08:24.421 --> 08:25.672
I tell you. I tell you
the Tarkans...

08:25.756 --> 08:27.041
Play dead.

08:27.132 --> 08:29.839
Crichton, don't...
don't leave me.

08:29.927 --> 08:32.919
I remember now...
-Shh. Shh. Zip it.

08:33.013 --> 08:35.800
Sloggard:
Come on, we still got a lot
of crates to move.

08:35.891 --> 08:38.257
Frool:
How come I always gotta do
all the heavy lugging?

08:38.352 --> 08:41.185
Because you're not smart enough
to do anything else, that's why.

08:41.271 --> 08:42.977
Oh? Well, why are you here?

08:43.065 --> 08:45.807
Because I'm not smart enough to
hang out with anyone else.

08:45.901 --> 08:48.233
Okay, do you think we
can take 'em out?

08:48.320 --> 08:50.356
Crichton:
I don't know. What if they
got friends downstairs?

08:50.447 --> 08:53.029
I'll take these two,
you can take the friends.

08:53.117 --> 08:55.199
What if there's a
hundred of 'em?

08:55.285 --> 08:58.322
Of these guys?
We should be so lucky.

08:58.414 --> 08:59.119
(stomach grumbles)

08:59.206 --> 09:00.446
Shh, look at this.

09:00.541 --> 09:03.624
No violence.
These are Tarkans...

09:03.711 --> 09:04.951
Somethin' set off the traps.

09:05.045 --> 09:07.252
Yeah. It got itself stuck.

09:07.339 --> 09:09.000
Will you come on?

09:14.805 --> 09:16.170
Is it dead?

09:16.265 --> 09:17.801
( Rygel passes helium )

09:17.891 --> 09:23.056
(helium voice):
Aah! Smells dead.
But it's not, yet.

09:23.522 --> 09:25.228
Gentlemen...

09:25.315 --> 09:28.807
I apologize for disturbing
your work.

09:28.902 --> 09:34.113
If you'd be so kind to get me
free, I'll be on my way.

09:34.199 --> 09:35.860
It speaks.

09:35.951 --> 09:37.691
It steals, too.

09:38.912 --> 09:39.947
Any more of you?

09:40.038 --> 09:42.199
Rygel:
No, I'm all alone.

09:42.291 --> 09:44.407
Yeah, I can see why.
-Come on.

09:44.501 --> 09:47.538
We've captured an intruder.
It claims it's all alone.

09:47.629 --> 09:48.880
Is it armed?

09:48.964 --> 09:53.082
No. But it's sure making
some strange noises.

09:53.177 --> 09:54.212
Don't touch it.

09:54.303 --> 09:56.840
Wait for me. I'm on my way.

09:58.307 --> 10:00.719
You, come with me.

10:05.439 --> 10:07.020
(whispering ):
What are you doing?

10:07.107 --> 10:08.222
Did I not tell you to stay put?

10:08.317 --> 10:10.308
Listen to me. These are
Tarkans. They're good people.

10:10.402 --> 10:13.769
You know jack about these
people. Now, you stay
behind cover.

10:13.864 --> 10:15.855
( spits )

10:15.949 --> 10:18.406
Greetings, Tarkans.

10:18.494 --> 10:20.280
We are honored to meet you.

10:20.370 --> 10:22.326
We mean you no harm.

10:22.414 --> 10:23.654
You said you were alone.

10:23.749 --> 10:26.365
I've never seen her before.

10:26.460 --> 10:28.246
No, not alone.

10:28.337 --> 10:31.170
There's a human and
a Luxan, too.

10:31.256 --> 10:34.123
Oh, I've told them of
your good works,

10:34.218 --> 10:36.174
but they're shy.

10:36.261 --> 10:38.172
Come on out. It's all right.

10:38.263 --> 10:41.596
Crichton, D'Argo,
show yourselves.
-Burning is too good for her.

10:41.683 --> 10:44.345
Come on, Crichton, D'Argo.

10:44.436 --> 10:48.054
Granny. What are you doing?

10:48.148 --> 10:50.309
You have got to stop
wandering off like this.

10:50.400 --> 10:53.062
Thanks for looking after
her, fellas.

10:53.153 --> 10:55.360
She's a little (whistles).

10:55.447 --> 10:57.358
You haven't seen my dog,
have ya?

10:58.242 --> 10:59.732
Little Bubba?

10:59.827 --> 11:01.317
You got caught in a trap?

11:01.411 --> 11:03.197
Crichton, get me out.

11:03.288 --> 11:05.950
I got an idea. Why don't we
all put our guns down.

11:07.251 --> 11:08.411
There's two more!

11:09.795 --> 11:13.083
Noranti:
Stop! No violence. No firing!

11:13.173 --> 11:15.038
Chiana:
What's going on down there?

11:18.262 --> 11:20.218
D'Argo:
It's no good. They're shielded.

11:20.305 --> 11:21.966
They got body armor?

11:22.057 --> 11:24.218
That's a hell of an invention.
How come we don't have that?

11:24.309 --> 11:26.049
You three! Get them!

11:30.065 --> 11:31.771
Where are you going?

11:31.859 --> 11:34.225
Don't leave me.

11:34.862 --> 11:37.274
I'll keep you company.

11:38.323 --> 11:40.109
(grunting)

11:40.200 --> 11:43.112
Perhaps I should
introduce myself.

11:43.203 --> 11:44.534
lam...

11:44.621 --> 11:46.873
Oh, please, don't hurt me!

11:48.208 --> 11:49.789
(Rygel whimpering)

11:49.877 --> 11:51.833
Ah, thank you.

11:51.920 --> 11:54.332
This won't go unrewarded.

11:54.423 --> 11:56.539
(gasping)

12:00.304 --> 12:02.511
You... you didn't finish.

12:04.391 --> 12:06.507
Wha-What are you doing?

12:07.811 --> 12:09.767
( Rygel gasping )

12:09.855 --> 12:12.517
( Rygel yells)
-l'll catch up.

12:13.525 --> 12:15.436
Crichton?

12:17.237 --> 12:20.900
Those lights. I think they
were pulse blasts.

12:21.491 --> 12:23.277
We gotta help 'em.

12:23.368 --> 12:25.700
We have to get to them first.

12:25.787 --> 12:27.994
Well, you're a genius. How?

12:28.081 --> 12:31.118
The cannon on the Luxan's
ship should...

12:31.209 --> 12:32.619
Are you tenked?

12:32.711 --> 12:35.418
Only D'Argo can operate
that ship.

12:36.882 --> 12:39.248
Maybe there's another way in.

12:42.262 --> 12:44.753
( Rygel screams, loud thud )

12:45.766 --> 12:48.257
That was some drop.

13:16.630 --> 13:18.166
(in distance):
Down here!

13:18.256 --> 13:19.541
Crichton:
Ho! We got another one.

13:19.633 --> 13:21.169
I found 'em!

13:21.259 --> 13:22.385
D'Argo:
Think we lost those two?

13:22.469 --> 13:24.755
Noranti:
There's no need for... Oh!

13:27.683 --> 13:29.139
Will you listen to me?

13:29.226 --> 13:31.012
These are Tarkan freedom
fighters. They're heroes.

13:31.103 --> 13:33.094
On the planet Cavari,
there was a deadly plague.

13:33.188 --> 13:34.553
The Tarkans defied
the quarantine.

13:34.648 --> 13:36.479
They brought food,
clean water, medicines.

13:36.566 --> 13:37.976
They saved thousands of lives.

13:38.068 --> 13:40.434
Whatever, they're angels
of mercy.

13:40.529 --> 13:43.145
Well, what do you expect?
You walk into their house,
you steal, you shoot at them.

13:43.240 --> 13:45.856
D'Argo:
In case you hadn't noticed they
started to shoot at us first.

13:45.951 --> 13:48.863
Right.
-And they'll keep shooting at
us until we die, unless we talk to them.

13:48.954 --> 13:50.819
So let me mediate.

13:52.165 --> 13:54.281
You know, maybe we should
let her try.

13:55.919 --> 13:57.830
Nah, she's gonna get shot.

13:57.921 --> 13:59.786
And that would be bad?

14:03.510 --> 14:05.671
Rygel:
Can we discuss this?

14:05.762 --> 14:10.096
So, this is our intruder?

14:10.183 --> 14:11.263
One of them.

14:11.351 --> 14:14.218
One? You mean there's more?

14:14.312 --> 14:15.563
Three more.

14:15.647 --> 14:17.353
( growls )

14:17.441 --> 14:19.978
( Rygel shuddering )

14:20.068 --> 14:23.151
How did you find this place?

14:23.238 --> 14:25.274
Who told you we were here?

14:25.365 --> 14:28.277
Nobody. We found it
by accident.

14:28.368 --> 14:34.489
And that Mooka chain just
fell into your hand
by accident, too?

14:34.583 --> 14:36.414
I was just putting it back.

14:36.501 --> 14:37.752
( growls )

14:37.836 --> 14:40.043
Oh, please! No, lava! Oh...

14:40.130 --> 14:43.588
( over comm ):
I have the intruders cornered,
but I... I could do with some help.

14:43.675 --> 14:45.711
Why? Shoot 'em!

14:45.802 --> 14:47.793
Well, there's two of them and
they have two guns. I mean,
will this...

14:47.888 --> 14:49.344
this belt stop two guns
at once?

14:49.431 --> 14:51.387
-I'm coming up.
-No!

14:51.475 --> 14:53.682
I'll take care of it.

14:53.769 --> 14:56.306
You keep moving those crates!

14:56.396 --> 14:58.352
( Rygel whimpers)

14:58.440 --> 15:02.433
Try to remember we're
on a schedule.

15:03.278 --> 15:04.984
Describe where you are.

15:05.072 --> 15:07.108
Look, how am I supposed
to describe it?

15:07.199 --> 15:09.235
It all just looks like
rock to me.

15:09.326 --> 15:12.113
I won't get shot.
I trust Tarkans.

15:12.204 --> 15:14.195
Everyone knows their reputation.
-I don't.

15:14.289 --> 15:17.577
Me, either. Listen, John.
We can't shoot them.

15:17.667 --> 15:19.168
We're trapped.

15:19.252 --> 15:22.289
Maybe we should let the old
lady try and mediate a way out.

15:23.381 --> 15:25.758
All right. Fine. You're up.

15:25.842 --> 15:29.334
(groaning yawn)
Oh...

15:29.429 --> 15:30.760
Are you all right?
What's the matter?
-Yeah?

15:30.847 --> 15:32.929
Oh, I'm just a bit tired,
that's all.

15:36.061 --> 15:37.050
(sighs)

15:37.145 --> 15:40.012
Grandma. You okay?

15:40.107 --> 15:41.847
D'Argo:
I think she's asleep.

15:41.942 --> 15:43.307
Grandma.
-Oi!

15:43.401 --> 15:44.652
This is unbelievable.

15:44.736 --> 15:48.524
What, can't cook, won't bathe,
and now she's narcoleptic?

15:48.615 --> 15:50.981
She's a triple threat.
Grandma, get up!

15:51.076 --> 15:53.032
Any markings on the walls?

15:53.120 --> 15:54.735
No.

15:54.830 --> 15:56.161
Wait. Yeah.

15:56.248 --> 15:58.239
There's a...
some purple writing,

15:58.333 --> 16:00.324
but I don't know what it says.

16:00.418 --> 16:02.283
Purple?

16:02.379 --> 16:03.994
Grandma!

16:04.089 --> 16:07.081
The intruders are trapped in
the small lower alcove.

16:07.175 --> 16:08.164
Yeah.

16:08.260 --> 16:10.342
Good. I know exactly
where you are.

16:10.428 --> 16:12.089
Grandma, get up!

16:12.180 --> 16:14.136
Do you see those
purple markings?

16:14.224 --> 16:15.179
Mm-hmm.

16:15.267 --> 16:17.303
-Shoot them.
-Shoot the markings?

16:17.394 --> 16:19.851
Yes. Shoot them. Now.

16:23.441 --> 16:25.272
( screaming )

16:27.279 --> 16:29.110
Bad news.
-Trouble.

16:29.197 --> 16:31.734
Somebody's doing the Pompeii
thing. Let's go.

16:35.704 --> 16:37.911
(Crichton laughs nervously)
Uh, more bad news.

16:37.998 --> 16:39.613
Same dren, different planet.

16:39.708 --> 16:41.414
Yeah, we're trapped.

16:41.501 --> 16:43.082
Again.

16:46.548 --> 16:48.084
D'Argo:
The Iava's rising. Jump.

16:48.175 --> 16:49.085
Jump?

16:49.176 --> 16:50.541
Jump.

16:51.970 --> 16:53.255
Yeah, yeah, I can make that.

16:53.346 --> 16:55.507
But the, uh, old bat can't.

16:55.599 --> 16:57.339
Old bats can fly.

17:02.689 --> 17:04.645
(grunts)

17:07.402 --> 17:09.233
You're up.

17:09.321 --> 17:11.482
All right, look, I lied.
I can't make thatjump.

17:11.573 --> 17:13.484
You can't make thatjump?
Give me your foot.

17:14.201 --> 17:14.906
Come on.

17:14.993 --> 17:15.618
Go!

17:15.702 --> 17:16.612
(yells)

17:16.703 --> 17:18.864
(grunts)

17:19.206 --> 17:20.787
Hmm...

17:21.917 --> 17:23.703
Okay.
( grunts )

17:26.671 --> 17:29.048
D, grab my hand.

17:29.132 --> 17:30.588
D'Argo:
I can't reach!

17:41.019 --> 17:43.055
I didn't know you
could do that.

17:43.146 --> 17:45.512
( Iisping )
It takes a bit of practice.

17:48.652 --> 17:52.190
Sikozu:
I take it you did not find
another entrance.

17:52.280 --> 17:55.147
(panting):
No.

17:55.242 --> 17:57.483
What are you doing?

17:57.577 --> 18:01.820
Trying to power up this
vessel's cannon.

18:01.915 --> 18:03.371
I take it your memory's frelled.

18:03.458 --> 18:05.323
I told you only D'Argo can
operate this ship.

18:05.418 --> 18:10.458
And D'Argo is a fool if he has
not set an override sequence.

18:10.548 --> 18:12.755
I don't think you should be
blaming D'Argo in this instance.

18:12.842 --> 18:14.753
He's already saved
your eema once.

18:14.844 --> 18:16.300
All right. Fine.

18:16.388 --> 18:18.174
He is a big and brave warrior.

18:18.265 --> 18:22.008
However, if these controls
are locked to his DNA,

18:22.102 --> 18:27.768
it was not particularly smart
of him not to have set up an
override sequence.

18:27.857 --> 18:29.438
Wait...

18:31.194 --> 18:33.310
(laughing):
Wait.

18:33.405 --> 18:34.235
You're right.

18:34.322 --> 18:37.029
Yes, Chiana, I usually am.

18:37.117 --> 18:40.029
Then we don't need D'Argo
to run this ship.

18:40.120 --> 18:41.530
We just need his DNA.

18:41.621 --> 18:42.736
(laughing)

18:42.831 --> 18:46.244
And how do you suggest we get...

18:46.334 --> 18:48.199
The intruders can't be alive.

18:48.295 --> 18:49.330
Well, they are.

18:49.421 --> 18:53.289
Your miserable lava traps
only got one of my men.

18:53.383 --> 18:55.169
Your men are worthless.

18:55.260 --> 18:57.626
Do you want to move all
of these yourself?

18:57.721 --> 19:00.212
You're the one who's so worried
about the schedule.

19:00.307 --> 19:04.141
Of course not...
-Crichton, D'Argo,
can you hear me?

19:04.227 --> 19:05.512
Rygel, are you all right?

19:05.603 --> 19:07.309
No, I'm dying.

19:07.397 --> 19:11.891
Please get me out of here
before my bowels rupture.

19:11.985 --> 19:14.317
Crichton:
Yeah, we'll do that, Sparky.
Where are ya?

19:14.404 --> 19:15.894
I don't know.

19:15.989 --> 19:18.071
Lower level, some cavern.

19:18.158 --> 19:20.695
Big pool of lava...
( screams )

19:20.785 --> 19:22.400
All right, we'll come get ya.

19:22.495 --> 19:24.611
Who's this?!

19:24.706 --> 19:27.163
Lou Costello. Who's this?

19:27.250 --> 19:30.333
My name is Raa'Keel.

19:30.420 --> 19:32.502
And my name is
Uta-Noranti-Pralatong.

19:32.589 --> 19:36.207
I'm afraid there's been a huge
misunderstanding which we
really must rectify.

19:36.301 --> 19:38.212
A misunderstanding?

19:38.303 --> 19:41.215
Yeah. We really shouldn't
be shooting each other.

19:41.306 --> 19:43.137
We didn't come here
to rob you guys.

19:43.224 --> 19:44.680
Hell, we didn't know there was
anybody on this rock.

19:44.768 --> 19:46.850
No, we're not your enemies.
We know who you are.

19:46.936 --> 19:48.642
You do?

19:48.730 --> 19:52.564
Yes. Every educated species
knows and reveres Tarkan
Freedom Fighters.

19:52.650 --> 19:55.642
Then you approve of our work?

19:55.737 --> 19:57.318
-Yeah...
-Absolutely.

19:57.405 --> 20:00.238
That thing you guys did
on Calamari that was
beautiful, man.

20:00.325 --> 20:02.486
Calamari?
-That was Nobel Peace
Prize material.

20:02.577 --> 20:04.568
(Rygel whimpering)

20:04.662 --> 20:07.278
Yet you attempted to rob us!

20:07.374 --> 20:10.081
Only because I did not realize
whose stuff it was.

20:10.168 --> 20:11.499
Had I but known...

20:11.586 --> 20:13.622
Crichton:
Yeah, please accept
our apology on that.

20:13.713 --> 20:15.249
Listen, why don't you
give us the slug.

20:15.340 --> 20:19.174
We'll punish him appropriately
and we are outta your hair.

20:19.260 --> 20:22.388
All right. We'll release him.

20:22.472 --> 20:23.222
Quickly.

20:23.306 --> 20:25.092
( screams )

20:25.183 --> 20:26.673
But he doesn't look well.

20:27.727 --> 20:29.308
You'd better come and get him.

20:29.396 --> 20:31.227
Yeah, we'd love to do that.
Where are you?

20:31.314 --> 20:33.976
Stay where you are.

20:34.067 --> 20:35.603
I'll send an escort.

20:35.693 --> 20:36.944
Fine.

20:39.030 --> 20:40.895
Find him.

20:40.990 --> 20:44.153
You know, I definitely do
not trust this guy.

20:44.244 --> 20:46.326
Me neither, but I got an idea.

20:46.413 --> 20:48.119
Well, there's no reason not to
trust him, I mean why...

20:48.206 --> 20:49.616
Grandma, zip it.

20:49.707 --> 20:52.369
We don't wanna hear what
saints the Tarkans are.

20:52.460 --> 20:55.042
We're not going in
there undefended.

20:55.130 --> 20:57.416
So you can either get with the
program or you can shut up.

20:57.507 --> 21:01.125
D'Argo:
Preferably both.
What's your idea?

21:02.846 --> 21:05.007
All right, here's the thing.

21:05.098 --> 21:07.760
I think that we ambush
the escort,

21:07.851 --> 21:10.183
we hit him with a rock,
and we take his belt.

21:11.688 --> 21:14.145
That is your plan?
-Yeah.

21:14.232 --> 21:18.020
To hit him with a rock,
when they have these,
like, shield things?!

21:18.111 --> 21:20.818
The shields work against
pulse energy.

21:20.905 --> 21:23.567
They don't work against other
things. We saw the guy
get burned.

21:23.658 --> 21:25.319
Yeah, but not by a rock.

21:25.410 --> 21:26.525
All right, let me lay
this out for you.

21:26.619 --> 21:28.905
Fire is thermal energy.

21:28.997 --> 21:31.955
Thermal energy is like
kinetic energy.

21:32.041 --> 21:33.906
A rock has kinetic energy.

21:34.002 --> 21:36.459
Ergo, a rock will work.

21:36.546 --> 21:39.162
Uh, okay, okay, I'm with you.

21:39.257 --> 21:42.294
Ijust have, uh, one small,
little question.

21:42.385 --> 21:43.215
(sighs)

21:43.303 --> 21:45.885
Who is Lou Costello?

21:45.972 --> 21:46.506
Wait!

21:46.598 --> 21:47.428
What?

21:47.515 --> 21:49.722
I want to help.

21:49.809 --> 21:51.470
Abbot and Costello.
We've been over this.

21:51.561 --> 21:53.017
Right.

21:54.439 --> 21:59.058
Sikozu:
That was yours, so this
must D'Argo's.

21:59.152 --> 22:02.736
No, no, no. This is Crichton's.

22:03.490 --> 22:06.232
This is D'Argo's.

22:07.410 --> 22:09.241
No living creature could
produce that.

22:09.329 --> 22:11.741
You haven't met many
Luxan's have you?

22:13.041 --> 22:14.076
Oh!

22:15.251 --> 22:16.206
Chiana:
Okay.

22:16.294 --> 22:18.000
Sikozu:
I should be doing this.

22:18.087 --> 22:21.329
Excuse me. I'm the one that put
my hands in the vomit.

22:21.424 --> 22:24.791
And I'm the one who happened
to observe D'Argo's
starting procedure

22:24.886 --> 22:27.093
when we left Arnessk.

22:27.180 --> 22:30.217
Press this, this, that and
those two together.

22:30.308 --> 22:33.641
This, this, and that.

22:33.728 --> 22:37.312
Computer Voice:
Power systems at your
command, Ka D'Argo.

22:37.398 --> 22:38.854
( chuckles )

22:38.942 --> 22:40.933
How do you fire up the cannon?

22:41.027 --> 22:42.938
That I do not know.

22:44.030 --> 22:46.737
I've never seen him
use the cannon.

22:48.243 --> 22:50.825
Great.

22:50.912 --> 22:53.824
Random flailing is
pointless, Chiana.

22:53.915 --> 22:55.576
Move aside and help me...
-Hey!

22:55.667 --> 22:59.205
I'm the one that put my
hands in the vomit.

22:59.295 --> 23:00.796
Okay, you want a turn?

23:00.880 --> 23:02.461
Go get your own vomit.

23:08.429 --> 23:11.171
Yes, the powder is ready.

23:11.266 --> 23:12.551
( blowing )

23:14.310 --> 23:15.686
Come through, but don't inhale.

23:15.770 --> 23:18.011
Okay.
-What is it? Sleeping powder?

23:18.106 --> 23:20.188
I don't know.
She's pretty vague.

23:20.275 --> 23:21.890
But this will knock 'em out.

23:21.985 --> 23:24.943
This wasn't part of the plan.
I signed on to haul crates,
not get killed.

23:25.029 --> 23:29.398
Me, too. If I get killed,
all my wives will throw fits.

23:29.784 --> 23:31.320
Ah!

23:32.745 --> 23:35.361
Here, come on, come on,
come on, Frool.

23:36.791 --> 23:38.247
Hey, fellas!

23:38.334 --> 23:40.199
Huh?

23:42.922 --> 23:46.164
(sultry music playing )

23:53.600 --> 23:57.559
Ooh, Frool, let's do it.

24:03.693 --> 24:05.308
Ooh, yeah, baby.

24:14.954 --> 24:16.740
Take it off.

24:17.665 --> 24:19.371
Noranti:
I am the flower,

24:19.459 --> 24:21.324
you are the bee.

24:24.547 --> 24:26.663
I am the pod,

24:26.758 --> 24:28.294
you are the pea.

24:49.322 --> 24:50.858
I am the target,

24:50.948 --> 24:53.155
you are the gun.

24:58.289 --> 24:59.790
(both laugh)

25:01.042 --> 25:02.703
(purring)

25:11.427 --> 25:14.009
(metallic clank)

25:14.097 --> 25:17.134
I am the woman,
you are the man.

25:17.225 --> 25:18.305
Oh, my God!

25:18.393 --> 25:19.473
( screams )

25:24.565 --> 25:26.180
(gasps )

25:28.653 --> 25:30.769
( squeaking )

25:31.698 --> 25:33.359
Well, you're not any help.

25:34.701 --> 25:37.283
Sikozu:
Now, move aside.

25:37.995 --> 25:39.326
(chuckling)

25:39.414 --> 25:41.370
All right.

25:41.958 --> 25:44.244
Oh, careful.
-Sorry.

25:50.800 --> 25:53.257
( beeping )

25:53.344 --> 25:55.630
You better hurry.
You're losing your vomit.

25:56.639 --> 25:58.220
I think I've decoded the
ﬁghtsequence.

25:58.307 --> 26:00.719
(engines roaring)

26:03.229 --> 26:05.345
(engines roaring)

26:12.280 --> 26:14.145
Slowly...

26:25.543 --> 26:28.285
(engines winding down)

26:32.467 --> 26:36.631
Actually, it's really
quite simple.

26:36.721 --> 26:38.712
To a great mind like yours.

26:38.806 --> 26:39.761
Okay.

26:39.849 --> 26:40.884
Fire the cannon.

26:40.975 --> 26:43.432
Certainly. I see the pattern.

26:43.519 --> 26:45.976
This locates the target.
-Right.

26:46.063 --> 26:47.348
(rumbling)
This one

26:47.440 --> 26:49.476
primes the charge.

26:49.567 --> 26:53.025
And this one... fires.

26:53.112 --> 26:55.603
(rumbling)

26:56.616 --> 26:58.948
(engines shutting down )

27:01.746 --> 27:04.032
Really quite simple.

27:04.332 --> 27:05.742
Frell!

27:06.918 --> 27:08.829
All right, so there's
nothing to turn on?

27:08.920 --> 27:10.876
Somebody shoots me and
I'm protected?

27:10.963 --> 27:12.078
Yeah.

27:12.173 --> 27:15.131
Well, I think we'd better
test it.

27:15.218 --> 27:18.255
Do you have any, uh, small
appendages you don't need?

27:18.346 --> 27:19.256
Small?

27:19.347 --> 27:20.712
Shoot him in the buttock.
That's big.

27:20.807 --> 27:22.468
Hey, you know what?
Don't touch my ass.

27:22.558 --> 27:23.809
That's sexual harassment.

27:23.893 --> 27:26.350
Whoa! No, we are not
shooting the butt.

27:26.437 --> 27:27.722
Okay.
-The butt is off-limits.

27:27.814 --> 27:29.554
Try the heel, or...
why don't we shoot you?

27:29.649 --> 27:30.980
You got a small appendage.

27:31.067 --> 27:32.432
Shoot me?

27:32.902 --> 27:33.561
Whoa!

27:33.653 --> 27:36.190
(humming)

27:36.280 --> 27:37.565
Son of a gun, it works.

27:37.657 --> 27:39.864
Now can we go and
talk to the Tarkans.

27:39.951 --> 27:42.158
There was no "we," white girl.
We appreciate what you did.

27:42.245 --> 27:45.203
It was different. But we have
two belts, three people.

27:45.289 --> 27:48.031
You're staying here.
We're not taking chances.

27:48.125 --> 27:50.332
Is this thing cutting
out on me?

27:51.212 --> 27:52.452
( hisses )

27:52.547 --> 27:55.414
Energy-save mode. It'll
reactivate when it's needed.

27:55.508 --> 27:56.964
Okay, let's get outta here.

27:57.051 --> 27:59.542
You guys, show the way.
Come on.

28:06.727 --> 28:09.013
Put some clothes on.

28:12.108 --> 28:14.975
Rygel (weakly):
You don't understand.

28:15.069 --> 28:20.359
If I don't take a slok soon,
my insides will explode
and I'll die.

28:20.449 --> 28:22.155
( groans )

28:22.243 --> 28:26.031
Crichton (a la Gomer Pyle):
Surprise, surprise, surprise.

28:26.831 --> 28:28.446
Raa'Keel:
What happened?

28:28.541 --> 28:32.159
They, uh, have our belts.

28:32.253 --> 28:33.663
Yeah, th-that's right.

28:33.754 --> 28:35.745
I can see that.

28:35.840 --> 28:37.330
Sparky, you okay?

28:37.425 --> 28:39.336
(weakly):
What do you think?

28:39.427 --> 28:41.008
Just hang in there.

28:41.095 --> 28:43.006
Okay, here's the deal, Tin Man.

28:43.097 --> 28:45.509
You can't hurt us,
we can't hurt you.

28:45.600 --> 28:48.592
You've got our whoopee cushion,
we've got Larry and Moe here.

28:48.686 --> 28:52.224
What do you say to
a simple trade?

28:52.315 --> 28:55.853
Why would I want these
morons back?

28:57.904 --> 29:00.145
Will you stop killing my men!

29:00.239 --> 29:02.195
Shut up and stand still.

29:02.283 --> 29:03.113
John!

29:03.200 --> 29:04.235
I got it.

29:04.327 --> 29:06.488
One of those frelling
booby traps.

29:11.751 --> 29:14.914
You know that thing I said?
About the Nobel Peace Prize
for Tarkans?

29:15.004 --> 29:16.585
( laughs )

29:16.672 --> 29:18.583
I take it all back.

29:18.674 --> 29:21.256
You think we're Tarkan
Freedom Fighters.

29:21.344 --> 29:22.709
We're not.

29:22.803 --> 29:25.636
We're robbing them.
And you can identify us.

29:25.723 --> 29:28.135
Need I continue?

29:28.225 --> 29:30.716
(growling)

29:31.228 --> 29:32.388
(snons)

29:48.329 --> 29:50.661
Crichton:
Right, so you're
robbers, whatever.

29:50.748 --> 29:52.204
We're not cops. We don't care.

29:52.291 --> 29:55.033
Actually, we've performed quite
a few burglaries ourselves.

29:55.127 --> 30:01.748
Well, you picked the wrong
place to burglarize today.

30:02.802 --> 30:04.884
Who else is with you?

30:04.971 --> 30:06.552
Uh...

30:06.639 --> 30:08.300
Get frelled.

30:09.141 --> 30:10.301
Ah!

30:10.393 --> 30:13.226
There's an old woman,
but she's no threat.

30:13.312 --> 30:15.428
What would you know?

30:15.523 --> 30:20.108
She can't get out and
no one else can get in.

30:20.194 --> 30:22.685
Why prolong her agony?

30:22.780 --> 30:25.943
Save us some time and
tell us where she is.

30:26.033 --> 30:28.115
Out riding her broomstick.

30:29.370 --> 30:31.326
I wonder which is worse.

30:31.414 --> 30:33.621
To burn to death from lava,

30:33.708 --> 30:37.576
or to suffocate in a column
of armarack.

30:39.380 --> 30:41.621
What do you think?

30:41.716 --> 30:42.876
Try something.

30:42.967 --> 30:45.629
I have tried every plausible
combination.

30:45.720 --> 30:47.130
Well, then try something else.

30:47.221 --> 30:48.131
Like what?

30:48.222 --> 30:49.428
Anything.

30:49.515 --> 30:50.971
All right.

31:02.194 --> 31:05.357
It's the Tarkans.
They've come back early.

31:05.448 --> 31:07.109
Don't be stupid.

31:07.199 --> 31:09.451
Why would they attack
their own race?

31:09.535 --> 31:11.491
Maybe they found our transport.

31:11.579 --> 31:13.615
If they blew it up,
we're trapped.

31:13.706 --> 31:16.368
It's well hidden.
How could they find it?

31:16.459 --> 31:19.121
That was Lo'La's cannon.

31:19.211 --> 31:21.247
Someone is in my ship.

31:21.338 --> 31:25.126
It's gotta be the girls,
but how did they get
your bodily fluids?

31:25.217 --> 31:27.549
Don't go there.

31:27.636 --> 31:29.217
You wondered who was with us.

31:29.305 --> 31:31.170
You just found out.

31:31.265 --> 31:34.132
That was our squad blasting
their way in.

31:34.226 --> 31:35.887
Your squad?

31:35.978 --> 31:39.015
Yeah. A whole platoon of
big, hairy guys

31:39.106 --> 31:42.223
with really cool tats and more
guns than you can count.

31:42.318 --> 31:44.229
They come down here and
find us dead,

31:44.320 --> 31:47.562
they're gonna slit you from
crotch to eyeball with
a dull deer antler.

31:47.656 --> 31:50.523
In other words, we die,
you die.

31:50.618 --> 31:52.483
We live, and you might
have a chance.

31:52.578 --> 31:54.284
You're lying.

31:54.371 --> 31:58.956
Wait. If it's true, we're going
to need some hostages.

31:59.043 --> 32:00.123
Why now?

32:00.211 --> 32:03.453
Of all times you could have
come here, why now?

32:03.547 --> 32:06.004
Do you know how long I've
been planning this?

32:06.092 --> 32:07.457
Life sucks, doesn't it?

32:07.551 --> 32:10.213
Well, quite often, in fact.

32:10.304 --> 32:12.386
Here, take this.

32:12.473 --> 32:15.431
If they try anything,
throw it at them.

32:19.355 --> 32:20.970
Chiana:
No, no, no, don't touch me.

32:21.065 --> 32:23.431
It was not my fault.
Do not get angry.
-No, don't touch.

32:23.526 --> 32:25.437
No, no, not angry.

32:25.528 --> 32:27.189
Vomit. Vomit.

32:27.279 --> 32:28.359
Oh.

32:28.447 --> 32:31.405
Yes, we must conserve it.

32:31.492 --> 32:33.198
Okay, you stay at the controls.

32:33.285 --> 32:35.150
I'm gonna go down and
check things out.

32:35.246 --> 32:38.033
It might be an idea to try and
turn the ship invisible.

32:38.124 --> 32:41.082
If... if you can figure out how.

33:01.230 --> 33:03.221
You said this'd be easy.

33:03.315 --> 33:06.899
While the Tarkans are off
delivering food to the orphans,

33:06.986 --> 33:09.568
we loot the place,
then disappear.

33:09.655 --> 33:12.442
Gun battles weren't part
of the deal.

33:12.533 --> 33:14.524
Stop complaining.

33:14.618 --> 33:16.119
You're wearing a shield belt.

33:16.203 --> 33:20.071
We were six! We're now three.

33:20.166 --> 33:22.953
Then try and shoot straight,
you incompetent.

33:23.043 --> 33:24.874
It'd make a nice change.

33:24.962 --> 33:27.248
You're lucky I'm here at all.

33:33.137 --> 33:35.253
( beeping )

33:37.266 --> 33:38.756
Keep still.

33:38.851 --> 33:41.263
Hit a beam and you'll be trapped
like your smelly friend.

33:41.353 --> 33:46.268
Mr. Redshirt, whatever the
Tin Man's paying you
we'll double it.

33:46.358 --> 33:48.565
D'Argo:
Come on, you heard what
Raa'Keel said.

33:48.652 --> 33:50.984
He doesn't want any witnesses.

33:51.071 --> 33:54.199
Do you think you're gonna
walk out of here alive
with your share?

33:54.283 --> 33:55.864
Crichton:
Don't take the chance.

33:55.951 --> 33:57.987
Throw in with us.
You'll come out ahead.

33:58.078 --> 34:00.330
We're the good guys.
-Shut up, or I'll give you
a face full of...

34:00.414 --> 34:02.029
(grunting)

34:02.124 --> 34:03.989
Oh! Here I am!

34:04.668 --> 34:06.329
Ah!

34:11.425 --> 34:13.666
(yelling)

34:13.761 --> 34:15.171
(groaning)

34:18.724 --> 34:20.589
Damn, he's completely encased.

34:20.684 --> 34:22.060
Where's that gizmo?

34:22.144 --> 34:23.350
There.

34:26.273 --> 34:27.513
You know how this thing works?

34:27.608 --> 34:29.269
I don't know, just press
the button.

34:29.360 --> 34:31.191
Watch where you point it.
-Whoal

34:31.278 --> 34:32.654
Set it lower.

34:37.243 --> 34:38.198
There ya go.

34:38.285 --> 34:40.697
Prop him up so I can
grill both sides.

34:41.205 --> 34:43.537
( beeping )

34:45.876 --> 34:47.252
Oh, damn it.

34:47.336 --> 34:50.874
I'm telling you, it couldn't
have been an attack.

34:50.965 --> 34:54.048
Probablyjust a pressure
eruption on the surface.

34:54.134 --> 34:55.840
Nothing to worry about.

34:55.928 --> 34:57.418
Nothing to worry about?

34:57.513 --> 35:00.880
If our transport's damaged,
we're dead.

35:03.894 --> 35:05.270
Damn.

35:18.701 --> 35:20.942
Check the transport.

35:30.379 --> 35:32.586
What are you doing?
It's too low.
-No, no, it's right.

35:32.673 --> 35:34.504
Give it more power.
What are you doing?
-It's not too low.

35:34.591 --> 35:36.877
Look, you're gonna break...
-I think it's out ofjuice.

35:36.969 --> 35:40.712
No, you're breaking it.
-And that, that is maxed out.

35:40.806 --> 35:42.467
It's out ofjuice.
-Oh, great.

35:42.558 --> 35:44.640
Okay, there's another one of
those canisters on the
level up top.

35:44.727 --> 35:48.561
All right, go get it. Don't
drag your heels. Rygel's going
to die here on us.

35:55.112 --> 35:57.194
No, no, no, Rygel!

36:00.200 --> 36:01.781
Rygel.

36:05.080 --> 36:06.945
Oh, crap.

36:08.250 --> 36:13.040
Eenie, meenie, minie, moe.

36:13.130 --> 36:15.416
Don't even consider it, John.

36:15.507 --> 36:17.372
Oh...
-You know far too well,

36:17.468 --> 36:20.426
the shield belt doesn't
work against lava.

36:20.512 --> 36:23.675
Yeah, I figured that out.

36:23.766 --> 36:26.348
But it might work if it's
already activated.

36:26.435 --> 36:27.925
Far too risky.

36:28.020 --> 36:31.683
Look, I put Rygel in there,
I'm gonna have to get him out.

36:31.774 --> 36:33.389
He's already dead.

36:33.484 --> 36:35.145
You don't know that.

36:35.235 --> 36:38.318
The amber protects the crates.
It might protect Rygel.

36:39.615 --> 36:42.277
How long has he been
without air?

36:42.368 --> 36:43.858
He's amphibious. He can last.

36:43.952 --> 36:45.328
Would you quit buzzing
around in my head?

36:45.412 --> 36:47.448
You're giving me a headache.

36:48.123 --> 36:49.329
Go.

36:50.918 --> 36:52.328
Okay.

37:11.271 --> 37:13.432
( powering down )

37:16.276 --> 37:18.267
( sizzle )
Ah!

37:18.362 --> 37:20.227
Hmm...

37:20.322 --> 37:21.778
Okay.

37:21.865 --> 37:24.356
At least we know I'm insane.

37:26.370 --> 37:28.577
Raa'Keel, transport's fine.

37:28.664 --> 37:31.952
Not a scratch.
Did you see anyone?

37:32.042 --> 37:34.419
No. It had too be a bluff.

37:34.503 --> 37:36.960
Then what did this?

37:37.047 --> 37:39.333
I don't know.

37:39.425 --> 37:40.756
What's the difference?

37:40.843 --> 37:43.710
We're getting out now before
the Tarkans get back.

37:43.804 --> 37:45.795
Load up as much as you can.

37:45.889 --> 37:48.426
I'll dispose of the hostages.

37:53.856 --> 37:54.595
(gasping)

37:54.690 --> 37:55.896
Shh, we must hide.

37:55.983 --> 37:58.395
What did you think I was doing?
-Shh. Come on.

38:00.821 --> 38:02.186
Morons...

38:02.281 --> 38:04.146
Noranti (whispering ):
These are not real
Tarkans at all.

38:04.241 --> 38:05.356
They're highly evil men.

38:05.451 --> 38:07.533
Oh. Well, I wouldn't
have guessed.

38:07.619 --> 38:09.200
Come on, let's get the others
and get out of here.

38:09.288 --> 38:11.370
No, it's not that easy.
Our weapons are useless.

38:11.457 --> 38:14.949
No, we have to find the
real Tarkans and tell
them what's happening.

38:15.043 --> 38:16.658
Send a message.
-Right.

38:16.753 --> 38:17.913
Are you klemmpt?

38:18.005 --> 38:19.745
Come here, come here,
come here, come here.

38:19.840 --> 38:24.584
Hey, these are highly
evil men, right?

38:24.678 --> 38:29.889
Okay, Sikozu probably doesn't
even know how to work the
radio, right?

38:29.975 --> 38:32.887
( footsteps )

38:32.978 --> 38:34.479
Where are you going?

38:54.374 --> 38:56.285
Frell her.

39:00.214 --> 39:03.081
All right Sparky, where are ya?

39:03.175 --> 39:04.585
Come on, Bubba.

39:04.676 --> 39:07.634
I'm too old to be playing
hide-and-seek.

39:07.721 --> 39:09.928
( powering down )

39:10.682 --> 39:11.888
Uh-oh.

39:14.561 --> 39:16.552
At least that works.

39:20.651 --> 39:22.391
(hissing)

39:23.904 --> 39:25.235
( growls )

39:28.200 --> 39:30.612
(grunting and yelling)

39:34.331 --> 39:37.323
Damn this has gotta be bad
for the sperm count.

39:38.001 --> 39:39.707
Is that you?

39:39.795 --> 39:42.081
Give me a bubble.

39:51.390 --> 39:52.880
Oh!

39:52.975 --> 39:55.216
Okay, let's get you some O2.

40:00.232 --> 40:01.972
(grunting)

40:08.365 --> 40:10.356
( powering down )

40:13.328 --> 40:20.416
Nice use of the shield belt,
but without that pathetic
little weapon, you'll burn!

40:20.502 --> 40:22.834
You do not... talk...

40:22.921 --> 40:25.833
about... Wynnona... like that.

40:33.557 --> 40:35.593
( screaming )

40:39.479 --> 40:41.561
Lift going down.

40:46.278 --> 40:47.893
Whoa, is that a head?

40:51.408 --> 40:53.148
(grunting)

40:59.333 --> 41:01.164
( powering down )

41:01.752 --> 41:02.992
( shouting )

41:03.086 --> 41:05.168
Prepare to feel fire!

41:05.255 --> 41:06.290
Crichton!

41:06.381 --> 41:07.245
Chiana!

41:07.341 --> 41:08.547
Shooﬂ

41:09.384 --> 41:10.499
Not him, me!

41:10.594 --> 41:11.504
What?

41:11.595 --> 41:13.631
Just shoot me!

41:21.772 --> 41:23.012
Hey!

41:30.656 --> 41:32.146
Keep shooting me.

41:32.240 --> 41:34.617
I gotta find Rygel.

41:40.207 --> 41:42.198
What's going on? Tell me wha...

41:49.383 --> 41:51.965
Can I get a "Hell, yeahl"?

41:53.428 --> 41:54.713
(gasping)

41:54.805 --> 41:56.591
Quickly, quickly.

41:56.682 --> 41:58.218
Crichton:
I'm workin' it.

41:58.308 --> 41:59.718
Hurry up!

41:59.810 --> 42:03.473
Oh, hezmana.

42:03.563 --> 42:05.019
(passing helium)

42:05.107 --> 42:06.938
Whoa!

42:07.025 --> 42:10.392
(helium voice):
Man, somebody had something
crawl up their ass and die.

42:10.487 --> 42:12.318
Damn, nobody light a match.

42:12.406 --> 42:14.271
Or breathe.

42:15.033 --> 42:16.944
Or move.

42:19.329 --> 42:22.196
Noranti:
No. No, wait.

42:22.290 --> 42:24.246
These are Tarkans.

42:24.334 --> 42:25.198
Good people.

42:25.293 --> 42:27.158
That's would you said
the last time.

42:27.254 --> 42:29.119
No, no, don't worry.
I've told them all about them
and us and the robbery

42:29.214 --> 42:31.330
and how we're not
their enemies.

42:32.342 --> 42:33.798
And they believed you?

42:35.387 --> 42:37.753
Raa'Keel.

42:37.848 --> 42:40.430
Once one of us.

42:40.517 --> 42:43.850
Now, just a traitor
and a thief.

42:46.898 --> 42:48.149
Guess they believed her.

42:48.233 --> 42:51.100
You're free to go.

42:51.194 --> 42:53.025
(passing helium)

42:53.113 --> 42:55.695
(groaning)

42:55.782 --> 42:58.740
(helium voice):
As long as you take
him with you.

43:07.085 --> 43:08.416
Thanks for the belt.

43:08.503 --> 43:10.209
A pleasure.

43:10.297 --> 43:13.289
And thank you for the, uh...

43:13.383 --> 43:15.624
Oh, jilnak.

43:15.719 --> 43:18.131
Ah, we've gotta go.
-Oh, my module is
parked in orbit

43:18.221 --> 43:20.507
and the meter is running out.

43:20.599 --> 43:21.679
Oh.

43:21.767 --> 43:24.053
I'll never eat again.

43:24.144 --> 43:27.636
The very thought of food
nauseates me.

43:27.731 --> 43:29.562
Sork wings.

43:29.649 --> 43:31.514
Crispy grolack.

43:31.610 --> 43:33.896
( groans )
-Excuse me. Excuse me.

43:35.989 --> 43:39.231
What is this mess?
And the smell!

43:40.035 --> 43:42.151
Sikozu:
This is all you.

43:42.245 --> 43:45.237
Well, from you.

43:46.917 --> 43:49.124
Whose idea was this?

43:49.211 --> 43:50.701
Mine.

43:50.796 --> 43:52.536
Crichton:
D, why don't we fire this
thing up before the Tarkans

43:52.631 --> 43:54.462
realize that Grandma has
poisoned them?

43:54.549 --> 43:56.130
Merely a cleansing restorative.

43:56.218 --> 43:58.129
Not one word.

43:58.220 --> 44:02.213
(ship powers up)
Computer Voice:
Power systems at your command.

44:09.314 --> 44:11.930
A received transmission
awaits your review.

44:12.025 --> 44:13.310
We have an answering machine.

44:13.401 --> 44:16.063
Have we got a message?
-Quick. Play it. Play it now.

44:16.154 --> 44:18.110
Just shut up.

44:18.198 --> 44:22.817
( static-filled transmission )
Ka D'Argo. Moya and I have
received your signal.

44:22.911 --> 44:25.823
Here is our location.
We look forward to your return.

44:25.914 --> 44:27.404
It's Pilot.

44:27.499 --> 44:31.959
Repeat, Moya and l have
received your signal.

44:32.045 --> 44:33.546
Pilot.

44:33.630 --> 44:35.211
Oh!

44:35.298 --> 44:39.962
By the yotz, Moya's all right.
She's waiting for us.
