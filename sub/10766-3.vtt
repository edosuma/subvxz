00:05.751 --> 00:07.150
Hi, little one.

00:07.219 --> 00:09.847
Of course, you won't make an appearance
for about six months now...

00:09.922 --> 00:12.083
but I thought
you'd like to meet your family.

00:13.025 --> 00:14.549
I'm your daddy.

00:14.793 --> 00:18.194
Can you say "daddy"?

00:19.364 --> 00:21.059
And here...

00:22.000 --> 00:26.096
Here is your mommy.

00:26.838 --> 00:28.169
And here...

00:29.308 --> 00:30.434
is you.

00:32.177 --> 00:34.270
Hello in there.

00:34.947 --> 00:38.212
Mommy, why don't we call the kids down
and tell them that you're pregnant?

00:38.283 --> 00:40.012
Kids! Kids!

00:40.252 --> 00:43.187
Come on down,
we have a big surprise for you.

00:44.790 --> 00:46.917
Oh, check it out. LAPD, The Home Game.

00:49.161 --> 00:52.358
We're making a movie?
Here, check it out, Uncle Phil. Hold on.

00:59.071 --> 01:01.437
I have fallen and I can't get up.

01:03.408 --> 01:04.875
Will.

01:05.209 --> 01:07.804
Kids, come on now, brace yourself.

01:07.913 --> 01:09.847
I have some very important news for you.

01:09.915 --> 01:12.748
Okay, but I'm living with the one
who keeps the house.

01:18.390 --> 01:20.722
No. We're not getting a divorce, stupid.

01:22.594 --> 01:24.186
We're having a baby.

01:30.068 --> 01:31.365
Wait. Hold it, hold it, hold it.

01:31.837 --> 01:33.702
Y ou and you?

01:38.977 --> 01:41.605
This is serious. We're having a baby.

01:42.881 --> 01:44.712
Y o, they ain't laughing, y'all.

01:45.817 --> 01:48.342
Okay, I think I speak for everyone
when I say:

01:49.187 --> 01:50.176
<i>E</i> w!

01:52.357 --> 01:53.984
And I'm not baby-sitting.

01:55.093 --> 01:57.186
I'm not changing diapers.

01:57.462 --> 01:59.327
And I'm not sharing my trust fund.

02:00.899 --> 02:03.163
Let's try this again, shall we?

02:09.107 --> 02:11.371
Now, kids, I have great news.

02:11.443 --> 02:13.434
We're going to have a baby!

02:14.112 --> 02:15.875
Y ay.

03:33.892 --> 03:36.156
Good morning, honey.

03:38.063 --> 03:39.655
Going to the electric chair?

03:41.166 --> 03:43.999
Philip, since I got pregnant,
I can't stop eating.

03:44.736 --> 03:47.830
But, honey, you got to be careful
of what you eat.

03:47.906 --> 03:50.397
Remember, baby,
you're eating for two now.

03:50.475 --> 03:53.842
Y ou better watch it, since I could get used
to all this attention, you know.

03:53.912 --> 03:56.142
That's fine with me, baby.
Let me take care of you.

03:56.214 --> 03:57.511
No, no, that's all fat.

03:57.582 --> 03:59.277
No, no, all sugar.

03:59.384 --> 04:01.375
No, no, that's all right.

04:06.758 --> 04:09.124
The catering business is so unfair.

04:09.194 --> 04:12.686
I mean, a couple of nuns get botulism
and all of a sudden, I'm blacklisted.

04:14.166 --> 04:17.363
Y eah, yeah, yeah. That's too bad. So how's
the apartment hunting going, honey?

04:17.435 --> 04:18.766
<i>E</i> xcuse me?

04:19.271 --> 04:21.500
Hilary, we've been over this.

04:21.572 --> 04:23.871
With the baby coming,
we're going to need the room.

04:23.942 --> 04:26.240
Wait a minute. I have to move out?

04:26.311 --> 04:28.973
Whose fault is it that she's pregnant?

04:34.052 --> 04:36.816
Besides, we have three extra bedrooms.

04:36.888 --> 04:39.083
Y es, and we don't want you
in any of them.

04:41.293 --> 04:42.521
Philip.

04:42.828 --> 04:45.661
Hilary, honey,
what your father's trying to say is...

04:45.730 --> 04:47.630
you don't live here anymore, honey.

04:52.270 --> 04:54.101
But this is all so sudden.

04:55.373 --> 04:59.332
I mean, like, if I'd only had
some kind of warning or something.

05:13.491 --> 05:15.254
Hello, is this on?

05:16.194 --> 05:18.924
Where do you expect me to go?
I don't have anything saved.

05:18.997 --> 05:20.988
Honey, we'll pay first
and last month's rent.

05:21.066 --> 05:23.796
- What about the months in between?
- Get a job.

05:27.205 --> 05:28.570
Again?

05:29.140 --> 05:31.665
What a week.
First, those damn nuns, now this.

05:32.777 --> 05:33.903
Hey, what's up, Hil?

05:33.979 --> 05:36.846
A word to the wise, Will:
Stay in high school forever.

05:37.349 --> 05:38.338
Bet.

05:40.352 --> 05:42.684
- Hey, good morning, y'all.
- Good morning.

05:45.323 --> 05:46.881
I just want a sticky bun.

05:47.759 --> 05:49.693
I'm just going to get a sticky bun.

05:56.434 --> 05:58.493
Mom, I look dorky.

05:58.570 --> 06:00.595
Oh, honey, you look adorable.

06:00.672 --> 06:03.971
Y ou're just nervous about your first day
at a new school, but don't be, come on.

06:04.042 --> 06:06.943
- Y ou're going to make a lot of new friends.
- What if no one likes me?

06:07.012 --> 06:08.980
Just do what Carlton does:
Give them money.

06:09.881 --> 06:13.373
Sweetheart, you're going to be all right.
Y ou have a wonderful personality.

06:13.451 --> 06:14.748
Oh, great, now I'm ugly.

06:16.755 --> 06:20.521
Y ou are not ugly.
Y ou are beautiful and you're smart.

06:20.592 --> 06:23.527
And you're going to have a fabulous day
at your new school. Okay?

06:23.595 --> 06:25.324
And I'm going to be here
when you get home...

06:25.397 --> 06:27.524
and I want to hear all about it. Okay?

06:30.869 --> 06:32.063
- Hi, guys.
- Hi.

06:32.137 --> 06:34.401
This is a great day.

06:34.472 --> 06:37.100
Little Ashley joining me at Bel-Air Prep.

06:38.143 --> 06:40.668
Hey, I thought you asked Dad
to send me to public school.

06:40.745 --> 06:42.042
Merely a trial balloon.

06:42.113 --> 06:43.978
The fact remains that I love you.

06:44.049 --> 06:46.916
But if we run into each other at school,
act like we've never met.

06:46.985 --> 06:50.045
Don't acknowledge me,
don't talk to me, act like I'm invisible.

06:50.388 --> 06:53.289
If you're not sure how,
just do what all the other girls do.

06:56.661 --> 06:57.992
Look, I'm serious.

06:58.063 --> 07:00.361
This is my senior year,
and I don't want you tagging along.

07:00.432 --> 07:02.730
I've worked too hard at becoming popular.

07:03.435 --> 07:05.266
And any day now,
it's going to kick in, right?

07:06.805 --> 07:07.829
Darn tooting.

07:09.007 --> 07:10.304
Hey, look.

07:10.375 --> 07:13.902
I just think it's about time
Bel-Air Prep went coed.

07:13.979 --> 07:16.641
There's going to be cute girls everywhere.

07:16.881 --> 07:20.817
Cute, rich girls that know
the one thing their parents can't stand...

07:20.885 --> 07:23.649
is for them to be dating a big black dude.

07:28.426 --> 07:31.827
Will, can I hang out with you
until I make some friends?

07:31.896 --> 07:32.988
Oh, yeah, sure, Ash.

07:33.064 --> 07:36.033
Just look for the huddle of girls
with the chocolate center.

07:44.576 --> 07:47.704
It's a disgrace. It's a scandal.

07:47.779 --> 07:49.747
It's an outrage!

07:50.415 --> 07:52.246
It's the mother of my children.

07:54.085 --> 07:55.177
Carlton, look.

07:55.253 --> 07:57.585
The way to make an impression
is to relax, man.

07:57.655 --> 07:59.623
Y ou got to be calm, chill out a little bit.

08:01.893 --> 08:03.656
Hurt me! Hurt me!

08:06.331 --> 08:07.730
What's up, baby?

08:07.799 --> 08:09.266
The name's Veronica.

08:09.334 --> 08:11.393
Veronica, I likes that.

08:12.637 --> 08:15.231
Great. Now, I can die.

08:17.108 --> 08:18.234
Hold up, baby. See...

08:18.309 --> 08:20.777
now, I noticed you noticing me.

08:21.246 --> 08:25.012
So I just want to put you on notice
that I noticed you, too.

08:25.083 --> 08:26.607
And?

08:26.751 --> 08:30.278
And to let you know that, you know,
I might consider letting you be with me.

08:30.488 --> 08:32.922
Is that what passes for a compliment
around here?

08:32.991 --> 08:34.982
- Look, baby, listen.
- No, you listen.

08:35.059 --> 08:36.652
If you want a shot at being with me...

08:36.727 --> 08:40.289
maybe you should try talking to me
like a human being, okay? Got it?

08:44.536 --> 08:47.869
Actually, baby, you got it,
but I take donations.

08:50.675 --> 08:53.337
Dag, Will.
Y ou sure have a way with the ladies.

08:53.411 --> 08:54.742
Hey, man, what's your secret?

08:54.813 --> 08:56.610
Well, I would like to help you out,
my brother.

08:56.681 --> 08:58.273
But, you know, it's a chemical thing.

08:58.383 --> 08:59.941
Y ou drug them?

09:02.153 --> 09:03.814
No, no, no. Look, Kenny, it's instinct.

09:03.888 --> 09:05.014
Like, you know the old saying:

09:05.090 --> 09:07.718
"Those who can, do,
those who can't, teach"?

09:07.792 --> 09:09.657
Well, I can and I do.

09:10.562 --> 09:11.654
That's deep, man.

09:11.729 --> 09:13.924
Slide over here for a second.
I'll give you a few pointers.

09:13.998 --> 09:15.465
Incoming!

09:19.070 --> 09:22.870
Well, Carlton, here we have a couple of
particularly impressive competitors.

09:22.941 --> 09:24.135
Judges!

09:28.046 --> 09:31.573
Will, the judges like her.
They really, really like her.

09:33.218 --> 09:35.345
And let's hear it
for the <i>E</i> ast German team!

09:49.968 --> 09:52.027
- Hi, Carl.
- Out of the way, Ashley. I'm trying to see.

09:52.103 --> 09:53.331
Ashley, watch out!

10:06.851 --> 10:09.285
I can't believe how hard it is
to find a beachfront place...

10:09.354 --> 10:11.822
with a pool and tennis court
for $500 a month.

10:14.025 --> 10:16.425
I mean, what's happening to this country?

10:16.494 --> 10:18.462
It's enough to make me want to vote.

10:19.464 --> 10:21.364
Maybe you should
lower your standards a little.

10:21.466 --> 10:25.402
Y ou're not going to be happy until
I'm living in a trailer, eating Spam on Ritz.

10:26.538 --> 10:28.335
I mean, that's where this is going, isn't it?

10:28.940 --> 10:32.205
Sweetheart, I found a few places
that don't look so bad.

10:33.244 --> 10:35.940
I'm beginning to get the idea
that you want to get rid of me.

10:36.014 --> 10:37.072
Run with that.

10:41.052 --> 10:42.849
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

10:42.921 --> 10:46.482
- So how was the first day at school?
- Way cool, <i>grand hombre.</i>

10:46.558 --> 10:49.789
Y o, Uncle Phil, it was booming, man.
Tasties everywhere.

10:49.861 --> 10:52.853
I mean, big ones, small ones,
short ones, tall ones...

10:52.931 --> 10:56.833
Black ones, brown ones, rich ones,
poor ones, crazy ones.

11:20.425 --> 11:22.325
Well, your aunt and I used to...

11:24.963 --> 11:26.453
It's not important.

11:27.832 --> 11:30.596
Carlton, I thought you were against girls
at Bel-Air Prep.

11:30.668 --> 11:33.637
Well, I'll be the first to admit
I had great reservations about it...

11:33.705 --> 11:36.765
but I've already learned that many of my
assumptions about the opposite sex...

11:36.841 --> 11:37.865
were just plain wrong.

11:38.843 --> 11:42.006
And that was just from 10 minutes
of hiding under the bleachers.

11:42.680 --> 11:44.545
Hey, guys. Come on over here.

11:44.616 --> 11:47.551
Y ou know, that reminds me
of my freshman year at college.

11:47.685 --> 11:50.848
Now, for extra money,
I had to work for the <i>Princeton Dai/y.</i>

11:50.955 --> 11:54.914
And my first assignment was to interview
the town's most famous stripper...

11:55.226 --> 11:57.126
Boom Boom LaSalle.

11:58.997 --> 12:00.897
I wonder why they called her that?

12:01.866 --> 12:04.835
For some reason, I don't know what,
she kind of took a liking to me...

12:04.902 --> 12:08.360
and so she invited me to go with her
and her sister to their dressing room...

12:08.439 --> 12:10.805
for drinks.

12:12.577 --> 12:14.044
Y ou the man.

12:14.345 --> 12:16.210
Anyway, one thing led to another...

12:16.281 --> 12:19.478
and before I knew it, this old country boy...

12:19.884 --> 12:21.909
finished his y oo-hoo and went right home.

12:23.521 --> 12:27.389
Wait a minute, Philip. Go back to where
you finished your y oo-hoo.

12:27.458 --> 12:28.652
Ashley!

12:29.994 --> 12:31.586
Ashley, baby, I'm sorry.

12:31.663 --> 12:34.564
- How was school?
- School was fine.

12:34.632 --> 12:37.795
- Did you make any new friends?
- A few. I've got to go study.

12:37.869 --> 12:40.133
Well, did some of the boys
try anything with you?

12:40.204 --> 12:43.037
No, nothing. Nothing at all.

12:45.843 --> 12:47.868
Uncle Phil, you'll be happy to know that...

12:47.945 --> 12:50.277
none of the boys
tried nothing with me, neither.

12:59.991 --> 13:01.788
There you go noticing me again.

13:13.338 --> 13:15.067
I'm telling you, she wants me.

13:16.641 --> 13:21.237
She senses my raw animal power
and is incapable of turning away.

13:22.647 --> 13:25.946
She senses that big, wet, nasty blob
of mayonnaise on your cheek...

13:26.017 --> 13:28.144
and she can't eat till you wipe it off.

13:37.395 --> 13:39.920
- So, yo, you seen Ashley today?
- No.

13:40.064 --> 13:42.965
- Me neither. I wonder where she at.
- I don't know and I don't care.

13:43.034 --> 13:45.195
As long as she doesn't try
to sit with me again.

13:45.269 --> 13:46.759
It's kind of hard to impress the honeys...

13:46.838 --> 13:49.432
when your baby sister's blowing bubbles
in your milk.

13:57.315 --> 13:59.283
Will, check out the talent.

14:00.084 --> 14:02.951
She's cool! She's hot!

14:03.154 --> 14:05.816
- She's...
- y our baby sister, man!

14:21.072 --> 14:22.835
<i>E</i> ase back, man, ease back.

14:24.909 --> 14:26.740
What do you think you're doing?

14:26.878 --> 14:29.779
- Buzz off, short stuff.
- That's it, Ashley.

14:29.881 --> 14:33.248
I want you to...
I'm ordering you to look unattractive.

14:34.886 --> 14:38.788
Ashley, who did you have for breakfast,
some hormones or something?

14:39.624 --> 14:41.956
Beat it. I'm working the room.

14:43.661 --> 14:45.629
Hi, Bobby.

14:46.764 --> 14:48.629
Where'd she learn to walk like that?

14:48.699 --> 14:51.361
Y eah, where'd she get that
Lee Press-On body?

14:52.737 --> 14:55.001
Hurt me! Hurt me!

14:58.443 --> 15:01.537
Y o, baby.
Y ou see, I noticed you noticing me.

15:01.779 --> 15:05.442
And I wanted to give you notice
that I noticed you, too.

15:06.484 --> 15:09.112
Baby, you float my boat.

15:10.321 --> 15:13.290
I know you better float your midget boat
on out of here.

15:14.492 --> 15:15.982
Will, man, ease up.

15:16.060 --> 15:18.085
No, you ease up, man.
What do you think you're doing?

15:18.162 --> 15:19.720
The same thing that you do.

15:19.797 --> 15:21.628
I'm just trying to press up this woman.

15:21.699 --> 15:23.758
That ain't no woman, that's my cousin.

15:23.835 --> 15:27.703
I am too a woman, and I'd appreciate it
if you'd stay out of my business.

15:29.440 --> 15:32.432
Don't you shake your neck at me
like that, girl.

15:34.745 --> 15:36.645
- Come on, Kenny.
- Hey.

15:39.484 --> 15:41.179
And don't you shake that either.

15:47.725 --> 15:50.990
I did it. I found the perfect place,
and it's within my budget.

15:51.062 --> 15:52.461
- Y ou did?
- That's great, baby.

15:52.530 --> 15:54.964
Y ou guys were right.
I do have what it takes to survive.

15:55.032 --> 15:56.499
And it's true what they say:

15:56.567 --> 15:58.467
"Y ou give a man a fish,
you feed him for a day..."

15:58.536 --> 16:01.994
But you give a man a cow
and he can eat for a month, maybe more.

16:02.874 --> 16:04.967
Don't, don't, don't. She's on a roll.

16:05.943 --> 16:09.538
This place has got it all.
Pool, tennis, and full utilities.

16:09.614 --> 16:12.674
And I won't need any more than the
$500 a month that Daddy promised me.

16:12.750 --> 16:15.685
- That's an incredible deal.
- Unbelievable, even.

16:16.053 --> 16:18.453
- I think we should see this place.
- Well, if you want to.

16:18.523 --> 16:21.617
- I wouldn't miss it. I'll get the car keys.
- Y ou're not going to need them.

16:21.692 --> 16:22.750
Why? Is it in the neighborhood?

16:23.561 --> 16:25.085
Y ou're getting warmer.

16:25.963 --> 16:27.362
Well, where is it, exactly?

16:31.102 --> 16:32.729
I'm going to live in the pool house.

16:32.803 --> 16:36.330
Y ou said I had to be out of the house,
but not off of the property.

16:38.409 --> 16:40.070
And with the money
that Daddy promised me...

16:40.144 --> 16:41.509
it will cover my furniture rental.

16:47.184 --> 16:50.244
Philip! Philip, honey.
Honey, we're getting off easy.

16:50.354 --> 16:52.413
- Come on.
- But it's not fair.

16:52.490 --> 16:53.821
She's winning!

17:05.336 --> 17:08.896
Baby, I'm telling you. Y ou've got
more moves than a bowl of Jell-O.

17:09.874 --> 17:12.536
And there's always room for Jell-O.

17:13.778 --> 17:14.767
Wow.

17:15.346 --> 17:17.280
Dude sounds like a jackass.

17:19.884 --> 17:22.147
Actually, Will, he sounds like you.

17:23.054 --> 17:26.251
- So, Kenny, when are we going out?
- I don't know, baby.

17:26.324 --> 17:28.588
Y ou have to let me check my book,
and I'll get back to you.

17:28.926 --> 17:33.226
Y ou see, I want to make sure
I can give you my undivided attention.

17:34.999 --> 17:36.933
Actually, Will, he's better than you.

17:38.369 --> 17:40.701
I mean, look at you, you got it going on.

17:40.771 --> 17:43.865
Y ou got sweet hips, lips and fingertips.

17:45.910 --> 17:47.969
But, baby got back!

17:50.848 --> 17:51.872
Bye, baby.

17:52.283 --> 17:53.477
Wait a minute!

17:54.752 --> 17:58.153
Will. Will, I know my sister needs me,
but that girl was babelicious.

17:58.489 --> 17:59.922
Carlton...

17:59.991 --> 18:02.516
I think you know what you have to do.

18:04.228 --> 18:05.422
I know.

18:07.131 --> 18:08.120
Still...

18:08.399 --> 18:10.264
I would have liked to have been there
for Ashley.

18:10.334 --> 18:11.392
Hey.

18:23.147 --> 18:26.583
I was so sure looking like this
would make me popular.

18:35.826 --> 18:38.124
I mean, what do guys want, anyway?

18:38.195 --> 18:40.857
Ashley, look,
guys want a girl who's sweet...

18:40.931 --> 18:43.161
and kind and smart. Just like you.

18:43.434 --> 18:45.026
Kenny wanted the girl with back.

18:45.403 --> 18:47.098
Ashley, look, Kenny's a special case.

18:48.239 --> 18:49.797
Carlton wanted the same girl.

18:50.007 --> 18:51.907
Well, see, Carlton's a basket case.

18:54.412 --> 18:56.676
What about all the boys
in the hall yesterday?

18:56.781 --> 18:58.840
- See, Ashley...
- And all the guys in the beer commercials?

18:59.050 --> 19:02.247
- Look, Ashley...
- And all the guys who ask Hilary out.

19:02.620 --> 19:05.919
Look, all right, okay.
Look, Ashley, I can't lie to you, all right?

19:05.990 --> 19:09.084
Some guys don't know
what's special about a woman.

19:10.795 --> 19:12.729
Actually, a lot of guys don't know.

19:12.797 --> 19:15.561
Well, really,
damn near all guys don't know.

19:16.333 --> 19:20.702
Look, Ashley, there's still some guys
that appreciate quality, you know?

19:20.771 --> 19:22.136
And you're quality.

19:22.239 --> 19:24.173
Y ou don't got to do all this.

19:24.675 --> 19:26.040
Just work on being you.

19:26.110 --> 19:29.443
I'm telling you, the right guy
will come along. I promise you.

19:33.184 --> 19:34.310
Okay.

19:36.220 --> 19:38.654
Have your people call my people.
We'll do lunch.

19:40.324 --> 19:42.189
Give Mama a kiss, baby.

19:44.829 --> 19:47.696
- I'm really glad you're my cousin.
- Mama know. Go on, girl.

19:57.374 --> 19:58.739
Veronica...

19:59.443 --> 20:02.378
you know, I've thought about
what you said yesterday...

20:02.446 --> 20:04.676
and you know, I just wanted to tell you,
you was right.

20:05.116 --> 20:07.607
I'm sorry about the way I behaved...

20:07.952 --> 20:10.944
and I'd be real grateful if I could
have your number, so I could call you.

20:11.088 --> 20:13.488
That's really nice. What did I say?

20:15.559 --> 20:17.083
What did you say?

20:18.429 --> 20:21.091
Y eah. Y ou thought over what I said,
and I was right.

20:21.165 --> 20:22.598
What did you agree with?

20:23.067 --> 20:25.058
Y o, it was deep. I agreed with all of it.

20:26.403 --> 20:28.803
Y ou have no idea what I said, do you?

20:28.873 --> 20:31.171
Wait, hold up, girl, you tripping.

20:31.242 --> 20:33.335
I know what you said.

20:33.644 --> 20:36.909
Y ou, you... 'Cause we was right here.
Y ou said that...

20:37.615 --> 20:42.245
people who live in glass cribs
shouldn't throw hard stuff.

20:42.920 --> 20:44.285
No.

20:45.289 --> 20:46.984
"Let your smile be your umbrella"?

20:48.726 --> 20:52.526
Come on. Who cares what you said, baby.
I'm saying I'm trying to be with you.

20:54.031 --> 20:56.397
That's the first honest thing
you said to me.

20:58.235 --> 21:00.897
That's like a good thing, right?

21:02.006 --> 21:03.701
That's a very good thing.

21:03.941 --> 21:06.239
That's what I'm saying!
Write down your number!

21:09.346 --> 21:10.711
Y ou can't get it yet.

21:11.549 --> 21:13.141
But I've got your number.

21:18.689 --> 21:20.418
Hey.

21:39.577 --> 21:40.771
Hold up.

21:52.523 --> 21:56.186
Am I as superficial as all those guys
I warned Ashley about?

21:57.194 --> 21:58.718
I mean...

21:58.796 --> 22:01.424
could it be that I'm more obsessed
with breasts and thighs...

22:01.498 --> 22:03.796
than Colonel Sanders ever was?

22:11.442 --> 22:14.104
Mightn't I be able to look deeper?

22:14.178 --> 22:17.375
I mean,
to cherish women as full and complete...

22:17.448 --> 22:19.848
and complex individuals.

22:19.917 --> 22:21.646
And with this new understanding...

22:21.719 --> 22:26.679
to finally find and keep this true love
that eludes so many of us.

22:29.126 --> 22:30.115
Nah!

22:37.434 --> 22:39.425
Y o, baby, I know your feet must be tired...

22:39.503 --> 22:42.370
'cause you been running
through my mind all day. Come here, girl!

22:48.746 --> 22:52.273
How are we supposed to translate Cicero
with a bunch of girls...

22:52.349 --> 22:55.546
glossing their hair,
and glossing their lips...

22:55.653 --> 22:57.450
and messing up lines...

22:57.521 --> 23:00.388
and just trying to cover it,
but not being able to do it.

23:01.358 --> 23:03.690
Now, we got a lot of women
in the audience.

23:03.761 --> 23:05.752
Any of y'all ever glossed your hair?

23:07.031 --> 23:08.521
Because I don't know.

23:08.599 --> 23:12.433
<i>Maybe it's a new cu/t thing</i>
<i>or something, that / don't know about.</i>
