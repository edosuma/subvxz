05:25.912 --> 05:28.033
Well they're not
biting for sure now!

05:28.034 --> 05:29.654
Let's move around the bend.

07:07.938 --> 07:11.178
- We ain't stealing it, just

09:41.185 --> 09:42.435
- Well hell Ned,

09:42.495 --> 09:44.725

look's just like yours and you

09:44.726 --> 09:46.586

Look I'm just telling you,

09:48.223 --> 09:51.206

ain't much I can do for you.

09:51.207 --> 09:53.907
And you don't want to be
messing with those folks.

09:53.908 --> 09:55.888
Hey Darrel?
- Yes sir.

09:56.416 --> 09:58.325
- Y'all stay out

09:58.326 --> 10:00.006
Keep an eye out on this guy.

10:01.245 --> 10:03.345
- Look Mac why don't
you run along

10:03.370 --> 10:06.290
and write some pretty young
thing a parking ticket okay.

10:39.537 --> 10:40.917
- Looks good Mr. Nekay.

10:54.607 --> 10:57.067
- Hey Pop, you got a
dime for root beer?

10:57.133 --> 10:59.881
- Don't you be asking me

10:59.882 --> 11:01.132
- Ah thanks Dad.

11:04.513 --> 11:06.133

11:59.232 --> 12:01.565
- Yes sir,

12:01.566 --> 12:03.666
- Abigail, stay in the car.

12:09.632 --> 12:11.456
- Hi there,
Benjamin Ladner.

12:15.294 --> 12:17.693
Are you gonna swig
on that thing

12:17.771 --> 12:19.203
all by yourself?

12:19.827 --> 12:21.785
Or are you gonna be neighborly

12:22.152 --> 12:23.402
and share?

12:28.606 --> 12:30.507
A body could dehydrate itself

12:30.532 --> 12:33.027
out here in this here humidity.

12:36.542 --> 12:40.221
I bet a gentleman
would share his refreshments

12:40.912 --> 12:42.162
with a lady.

12:42.906 --> 12:44.439
- Come on Abigail
I believe

12:44.440 --> 12:47.187
that'd be getting a little bit too
mushy you know what I mean?

12:47.188 --> 12:49.320
I mean we ain't going
steady or nothing like that.

12:49.321 --> 12:52.381
- I ain't asking you to
go steady Benjamin Ladner.

12:53.113 --> 12:55.588
I want a sip of your root beer.

12:55.877 --> 12:59.305
Better yet you know
you could buy me one.

12:59.751 --> 13:01.469
- Well I reckon you
can have a sip

13:01.612 --> 13:04.312
but I ain't got no money
for a whole bottle.

13:04.696 --> 13:06.703
- This will do fine.

13:07.126 --> 13:09.277
Thank you kind sir.

13:13.563 --> 13:16.563
- Holy cow you pretty near
drained, I said a sip.

13:16.828 --> 13:19.795
- Oh my stars
Benjamin Ladner.

13:20.213 --> 13:23.513
Do you realize our lips
touched the exact same bottle?

13:24.337 --> 13:25.969
Why for all I know,

13:26.435 --> 13:28.130
I could be with child.

13:28.526 --> 13:30.601
- What, you're crazy.

13:33.384 --> 13:34.634
- Mr. Ladner,

13:34.854 --> 13:37.997
you may come a calling
any time you feel the urge.

13:39.181 --> 13:41.025
Daddy, are we about ready?

13:46.099 --> 13:47.898
Oh hello Mr. Ladner,

13:48.007 --> 13:49.867
I was just talking to Benjamin.

13:49.998 --> 13:54.245
He insisted I have a taste
of his refreshing root beer.

13:55.312 --> 13:56.872
- He shared his root beer?

13:57.209 --> 13:58.459
You'd be the first.

14:00.720 --> 14:02.265
- Come on Abby get in the car.

14:02.266 --> 14:03.766
We got chores to tend to.

14:05.623 --> 14:08.263
See you Darryl.
- Alright, y'all come back.

14:28.618 --> 14:29.868
Ow!

14:30.029 --> 14:31.279
Dang!

14:39.659 --> 14:43.559
- Sure be nice for a body to come
out here and give me some gas.

14:43.656 --> 14:45.816
This is a service
station ain't it?

14:47.025 --> 14:49.425
- Yes sir it is, what
can I do you for?

14:50.678 --> 14:51.928
- Fill it up, son.

15:00.662 --> 15:02.121
This Ned Buzby's place?

15:03.810 --> 15:05.060
Is he around?

15:05.539 --> 15:06.789
- Who wants to know?

15:11.108 --> 15:12.548
- None of your business.

15:15.601 --> 15:16.851
Well, is he?

15:19.007 --> 15:20.394
Ah hell, nevermind,

15:21.694 --> 15:22.944
I'll find him.

15:24.069 --> 15:26.349
Hurry up bud,
I need to be on my way.

15:27.383 --> 15:28.643

19:01.146 --> 19:02.396
Come on push,

19:02.672 --> 19:03.922
push.

19:19.014 --> 19:21.954
- You sure they aren't
gonna miss these candles?

19:22.306 --> 19:25.488
I sure hope these weren't the
blessed ones. You know what I mean?

19:25.489 --> 19:28.436
God might have put some kind
of curse on us for stealing them.

19:28.437 --> 19:32.217
- We ain't steeling them.
We're just borrowing them for a bit.

19:40.020 --> 19:41.664
Man, our own canoe.

19:41.762 --> 19:43.814
As long as we keep
it out of sight

19:43.815 --> 19:46.439
we don't have to worry
about getting caught.

19:46.440 --> 19:48.600
- Just know,
if we do get caught...

19:48.908 --> 19:50.308
I'm gonna rat on you.

19:56.841 --> 19:58.091
- Look alligators.

19:58.947 --> 20:00.197
Gotcha.

20:29.898 --> 20:32.031
Come on I want to
show you something.

20:32.032 --> 20:34.372
I wanted to see if
the coast is clear.

20:55.951 --> 20:57.687
I know where they
keep the money

20:57.688 --> 20:59.457
around here that ain't
in the register.

20:59.458 --> 21:01.798
Saw Ned put it in a
box, it's in here.

21:06.683 --> 21:09.145
Whoa, look at all
these hundreds.

21:09.819 --> 21:12.068
- Man you better
put it back Ben.

21:12.424 --> 21:15.844
- Man I ain't never seen a
$100 bill before, you either.

21:16.262 --> 21:18.302
- How much you
reckon's in there?

21:18.966 --> 21:20.706
- I don't know, I don't know.

21:21.625 --> 21:22.875
Could be thousands.

21:23.886 --> 21:25.626
- Man you better put it back.

21:25.980 --> 21:28.671
Your old man must be coming
around the corner any minute.

21:28.672 --> 21:31.312
Come on! - I wanna see
how much is in here.

22:03.835 --> 22:07.075
You asked your mom about
sleeping on the river right?

22:07.281 --> 22:09.350
- Yeah, she ain't too keen on it.

22:10.265 --> 22:12.905
But I'm pretty sure I
can talk her into it.

22:12.966 --> 22:14.466
- Well you gotta somehow.

22:14.623 --> 22:16.245
It's gonna be neat,
think of it Cory.

22:16.246 --> 22:17.803
We'll be out there
all by ourselves

22:17.804 --> 22:20.129
just like the settlers
did back in the old days.

22:20.130 --> 22:21.672
Don't pack a lunch or nothing.

22:21.673 --> 22:24.313
Let's force ourselves
to live off the land.

22:24.571 --> 22:26.401
- Great...
fish for breakfast,

22:26.838 --> 22:28.779
lunch,
and dinner.

22:29.613 --> 22:31.019
Oh that'll be fun.

22:31.926 --> 22:33.780
- Well we ain't got no
guns for shooting game

22:33.781 --> 22:36.121
so fishing is how
we're gonna survive.

22:36.758 --> 22:38.738
- Well,
if you're counting on me

22:38.910 --> 22:40.560
we're gonna starve.

22:40.904 --> 22:42.976
'Cause you know my
luck with fishing.

22:42.977 --> 22:44.777
I think somebody put a sign on

22:44.789 --> 22:46.589
my face that says
do not bite.

22:48.022 --> 22:49.503
- Hey I was just wondering.

22:49.504 --> 22:51.503
Do you think Father
Dominic saw you take,

22:51.504 --> 22:53.184
I mean borrow those candles?

22:54.662 --> 22:56.042
- Nah I don't think so.

23:02.218 --> 23:04.978
I wish you'd stear clear
of these tree limbs.

23:05.140 --> 23:07.540
You want a snake
falling in this thing?

23:08.052 --> 23:09.302
Speaking of snakes,

23:10.267 --> 23:12.967
I saw creepy Abigail
at school the other day

23:13.048 --> 23:14.524
and she was asking

23:14.527 --> 23:16.026
about you.

23:16.630 --> 23:17.880
- Cut it out man.

23:17.905 --> 23:20.453
- Ben and Abigail
sitting in a tree,

23:20.917 --> 23:23.551
K-I-S-S-I-N-G!

23:40.695 --> 23:41.945
Almost there.

23:43.906 --> 23:45.569
- There we go Cory.
- Reach.

23:45.570 --> 23:47.370
- Alright pull pull, hurry up.

24:04.095 --> 24:05.345
- Come on let's go!

24:07.583 --> 24:09.143
Race you to the happy log.

24:09.168 --> 24:10.488
- I'll beat you there,

24:11.680 --> 24:13.180
I'm gonna beat you there.

24:19.111 --> 24:20.361
- Let me go.

24:35.268 --> 24:37.663
- Hey we got some smokes
around here don't we?

24:37.664 --> 24:39.748
- Yeah they're around
here somewhere.

24:39.749 --> 24:41.309
I buried them pretty good,

24:41.934 --> 24:43.184
aw dang.

24:43.276 --> 24:45.856
- Let me look.
- Nah man nah, I've got it.

24:52.723 --> 24:53.973
Yep here they are.

25:08.470 --> 25:10.184
How sweet it is.

25:22.227 --> 25:24.147
I can't get this thing to light.

25:24.185 --> 25:26.101
- It won't light
because they're wet.

25:26.102 --> 25:27.352
Give me one of them.

25:33.209 --> 25:35.277
- Well like it's a
real man's cigarette,

25:35.278 --> 25:36.838
ain't got no filter on it.

25:56.435 --> 25:58.295
- Dang,
this stuff'll kill you.

26:00.119 --> 26:02.828
- Sure ain't lying,
it's pretty good.

26:06.573 --> 26:07.823
Cory,

26:08.296 --> 26:11.116
think a girl could get pregnant
off of a kiss?

26:12.274 --> 26:13.936
- You did it,
you kissed Abigail?

26:13.937 --> 26:15.187
- No no, wait wait,

26:15.843 --> 26:18.330
I didn't kiss her,
she kissed me.

26:19.152 --> 26:20.402
- Oh my God.

26:23.189 --> 26:25.179
Oh no,
I think that's worse.

26:26.231 --> 26:28.723
- Cut it out man.
- It don't make no difference.

26:28.724 --> 26:31.184
Her lips touching yours
is all it takes.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.372
Man don't you know nothing
about the birds and the bees?

26:36.373 --> 26:38.243
Didn't your pa teach
you anything?

26:38.244 --> 26:41.184
Once the saliva's mixed
there's no turning back.

26:41.827 --> 26:44.887
That's how a baby's made
man everybody knows that.

26:46.197 --> 26:47.817
- No no no wait, wait wait.

26:47.864 --> 26:50.444
It has to be uh...
a french kiss you know,

26:50.478 --> 26:52.818
a tongue kiss with
the saliva and all.

26:52.865 --> 26:54.965
- Oh stop, you're
grossing me out.

26:55.374 --> 26:56.624
I'm gonna be sick.

26:56.917 --> 26:58.484
And the germs,

26:58.910 --> 27:01.145
didn't you stop to think

27:01.206 --> 27:02.988
about the germs?

27:03.287 --> 27:04.657
What's wrong with you?

27:04.994 --> 27:06.914
You had to go make her pregnant.

27:07.601 --> 27:10.781
Her father's gonna find out
and he's gonna kill you.

27:10.992 --> 27:12.782
Father Dominic's gonna find out

27:12.783 --> 27:14.720
and you're going
straight to hell.

27:14.721 --> 27:16.581
You're alter boy days are over.

27:17.993 --> 27:19.926
This is a mortal sin.

27:20.240 --> 27:22.837
- Come on Cory cut it
out this isn't funny.

27:22.838 --> 27:25.807
- Zoom, bang, wham,
straight to the moon Alice.

27:26.099 --> 27:28.952
Yep straight to hell,
no purgatory.

27:29.780 --> 27:32.240
I mean
everybody's gonna know.

27:32.774 --> 27:34.394
How you gonna fix this one?

27:34.419 --> 27:37.772
You gotta fake confession, and
there she stands behind you.

27:37.773 --> 27:40.011
- Stop it.
- Big as a house.

27:53.947 --> 27:55.197
Come on turn us Ben.

28:00.146 --> 28:01.466
I think we're over it.

28:01.762 --> 28:03.012
- Good hurry up.

28:11.084 --> 28:12.704
Hey Dad.
- Hey Mr. Ladner.

28:13.368 --> 28:14.618
- Don't tell me.

28:14.750 --> 28:16.464
- Come on Dad,
anybody around here

28:16.465 --> 28:18.200
got some money for a root beer?

28:18.201 --> 28:19.461
- Not that I know of.

28:19.854 --> 28:21.104
- Come on Dad.

28:21.725 --> 28:22.975
- Come on Dad.

28:24.275 --> 28:25.525
Alright,

28:25.726 --> 28:28.846
don't you boys be asking me
no more this week okay?

28:28.902 --> 28:30.971
Think money just
grows on trees huh?

28:30.972 --> 28:32.222
Get out the way.

29:02.430 --> 29:03.930
Be right with you Mister.

29:05.769 --> 29:07.811
- I'm looking for a Mr.
Ned Buzby,

29:07.812 --> 29:10.032
proprietor of Buzby
Service Station.

29:10.345 --> 29:13.122
I'm Mr. Johnson from the
Internal Revenue Service.

29:37.402 --> 29:38.652
- Mrs. Quavis,

29:39.473 --> 29:41.753
I'm so glad to see you back
in church.

29:43.040 --> 29:45.569
May I speak with you
for a moment? - Yeah.

29:45.700 --> 29:46.874
- Okay.

29:50.337 --> 29:52.137
Have you ever heard Cory pray?

29:52.686 --> 29:53.936
- No.

29:54.652 --> 29:55.902
- Well I have,

29:56.419 --> 29:58.639
and do you know
what he prays about,

29:59.367 --> 30:00.617
you.

30:02.729 --> 30:03.979
- Me?

30:04.838 --> 30:06.088
Oh...

30:06.639 --> 30:08.271
I been worried about him.

30:09.709 --> 30:11.964
He hasn't cried since Jimmy.

30:16.836 --> 30:19.344
Oh...
that river took my husband.

30:20.625 --> 30:22.570
And now Cory has no daddy.

30:26.660 --> 30:27.910
- Mrs. Quavis,

30:29.708 --> 30:31.808
the river didn't take your husband.

30:32.622 --> 30:33.872
Gambling did.

30:36.211 --> 30:38.595
You are a good mother.

30:43.915 --> 30:45.165
And a good daddy.

31:05.618 --> 31:07.919
- The boys helped me out
around the station today.

31:07.920 --> 31:10.320
They were actually
useful for a change.

31:10.805 --> 31:12.646
- Dad.
- No really son,

31:13.340 --> 31:15.792
I appreciated y'all
taking care of things.

31:16.020 --> 31:17.270
- Never fails,

31:17.498 --> 31:20.116
just sit down to eat and that
thing starts ringing off the hook.

31:22.858 --> 31:24.108
Hello,

31:24.596 --> 31:25.846
who?

31:26.379 --> 31:27.629
Abigail.

31:28.006 --> 31:29.686
- No wait Mom, I'm not here.

31:29.874 --> 31:31.705
- Yes he's here.

31:34.021 --> 31:36.241
But hun we just sat
down for dinner.

31:36.266 --> 31:39.326
Do you think I could have him
call you back? - No.

31:39.450 --> 31:40.700
- Okay.

31:42.267 --> 31:43.517
Mhm.

31:44.192 --> 31:45.442
Bye bye now.

31:47.713 --> 31:49.435
Well well Benjamin,

31:50.265 --> 31:52.049
she called you Benjamin.

31:53.529 --> 31:55.665
I think somebody's sweet on you.

31:56.104 --> 31:57.664
- Come on Mom, cut it out.

31:58.319 --> 31:59.757
- You don't have
to call her back.

31:59.758 --> 32:01.918
She just wanted to
leave a message.

32:02.147 --> 32:03.397
She said

32:04.547 --> 32:05.797
I haven't

32:05.948 --> 32:07.198
gained an ounce.

32:08.138 --> 32:10.966
Well I'm surprised about that.
The way her mama cooks,

32:10.967 --> 32:13.254
that family could stand
to lose a pound or two.

32:13.255 --> 32:15.212
- Now Julie come on
now, that ain't nice.

32:15.213 --> 32:17.793
- Oh hun I'm just
"fun-ing", what's wrong?

32:20.252 --> 32:22.532
- Ned, he never even
showed up today.

32:24.240 --> 32:25.490
Strangest thing,

32:26.041 --> 32:27.481
yesterday a man comes in

32:27.506 --> 32:30.255
and I ain't never seen him
before, asking about him.

32:30.256 --> 32:31.506
Knew his name too.

32:32.536 --> 32:33.786
Down right rude,

32:34.198 --> 32:35.878
kinda mean looking you know?

32:36.270 --> 32:38.370
Could almost tell
he's bad people.

32:39.841 --> 32:42.245
And today an IRS agent shows up.

32:44.393 --> 32:46.433
- What do you
reckon is going on?

32:47.461 --> 32:48.711
- I don't know.

32:49.367 --> 32:50.923
Think I'm gonna head
over to the house

32:50.924 --> 32:52.604
and check things out though.

32:52.895 --> 32:54.756
- Wait I don't like
the sound of this.

32:54.757 --> 32:57.577
Do you think you ought
to call Mac about this?

32:57.904 --> 32:59.164
- I don't know Julie.

32:59.795 --> 33:02.732
Ned'll just show up and I got
Mac out there looking for him.

33:02.733 --> 33:04.473
Ned'll be mad as all get out.

33:04.884 --> 33:06.134
- Dad,

33:06.667 --> 33:07.917
are you worried?

33:10.154 --> 33:11.894
- Let me put it this way son.

33:12.389 --> 33:16.289
It just ain't like Ned not to
show up and check on his business.

33:20.869 --> 33:22.119
- So anyway Mom

33:22.467 --> 33:24.305
last week I asked about

33:24.389 --> 33:27.136
if me and Cory could sleep out on
the river and you said it was okay.

33:27.137 --> 33:30.317
So I'm just reminding you
that tomorrow's the night.

33:30.657 --> 33:33.717
- Wait, I don't remember
you asking us about this.

33:34.952 --> 33:36.738
Darryl,
did he ask you?

33:37.123 --> 33:39.067
- Huh,
let the boy go.

33:39.884 --> 33:41.504
- What did Mrs. Quavis say?

33:41.661 --> 33:43.761
- She said it was
okay really Mom.

33:44.704 --> 33:46.324
- Don't be lying to me boy.

33:46.673 --> 33:49.013
I'm gonna call Mrs.
Quavis to be sure.

33:51.113 --> 33:52.363
- Go ahead son,

33:52.633 --> 33:54.193
I feel like fish tomorrow.

33:54.750 --> 33:56.790
Don't let me down now.
- Yes sir.

33:57.462 --> 34:00.762
Trust me if they're biting,
you'll be eating the fish.

34:24.149 --> 34:25.949
- Mac,
yeah it's Darryl.

34:26.795 --> 34:28.746
Listen...
I got a problem and

34:29.042 --> 34:32.397
I don't know if it's serious
or not but it's about Ned.

35:05.836 --> 35:07.229
- Rise and shine

35:07.234 --> 35:08.844
Huckleberry Finn.

35:44.697 --> 35:46.257
- We're going now!

35:51.141 --> 35:53.259
- Do you think those kids
we stole this canoe from

35:53.260 --> 35:55.360
would recognize us
if they saw us?

35:55.676 --> 35:58.256
- Hope not, besides we
didn't steal the canoe

35:58.257 --> 36:00.821
we borrowed it, there is
a difference you know.

36:00.945 --> 36:02.865
- I don't feel right about this.

36:02.890 --> 36:04.140
If we get caught,

36:04.658 --> 36:07.419
how are we gonna explain
to our parents that we got it?

36:07.420 --> 36:09.880
- You know what Cory
you worry too much.

36:09.937 --> 36:12.097
Besides we're not
gonna get caught.

36:14.920 --> 36:18.373
- I can't believe my mom said it
was okay to sleep out tonight.

36:18.374 --> 36:19.624
- Yeah me too,

36:19.830 --> 36:21.940
I was kinda afraid
she wouldn't let you

36:21.941 --> 36:23.801
on account of your dad and all.

36:24.761 --> 36:26.658
- Yeah,
I know,

36:27.774 --> 36:31.374
I hardly recognize my mom ever
since my daddy was murdered.

36:33.542 --> 36:35.642
I don't want to
talk about it Ben.

36:36.195 --> 36:37.515
- Okay Cory I'm sorry.

36:37.593 --> 36:41.013
But just know if ever do want
to talk about it I'm here.

36:43.404 --> 36:45.773
Hope we have enough candles
to light up all night.

36:45.774 --> 36:47.024
You know,

36:47.056 --> 36:48.976
keep the animals and stuff away.

36:49.188 --> 36:51.288
- Well we'll just
have to make do.

36:52.830 --> 36:55.710
- You know how long a
flashlight would last us?

36:55.828 --> 36:57.914
How many did you bring?
- Four.

36:58.644 --> 37:01.644
I just know I'm going to
hell for this borrowing.

37:14.309 --> 37:17.715
- Come on Clyde, deal me a good
hand here, make some money.

37:17.716 --> 37:19.622
- Hey Ned.
- Hey girl how you doing?

37:19.623 --> 37:22.455
- It's hot as Hades out
there but it's worse in here.

37:22.456 --> 37:25.437
- Yeah it is a little bit warm in here,
especially when you're around.

37:25.438 --> 37:27.658
I get a little hot
under the collar.

37:28.122 --> 37:30.096
Let's see if old Ned's got
a good hot hand here

37:30.097 --> 37:31.347
make a little money.

37:32.173 --> 37:33.932
Aw... not again.

38:47.432 --> 38:49.563
- How you fixed for cash Ned?

38:50.163 --> 38:52.563
I mean you can settle
up now can't you?

38:53.279 --> 38:55.587
- I'll get around to it,
don't worry about it.

38:55.588 --> 38:57.088
You know I'm good for it.

38:57.161 --> 39:00.127
- You're gonna get a round
to it sooner than you think.

39:00.128 --> 39:03.488
Look right now I'm gonna make
that phone call to Pappy.

39:06.306 --> 39:07.866
- Oh you can't be serious.

39:08.719 --> 39:09.969
Come on,

39:10.423 --> 39:12.223
wait just a damn minute y'all!

39:14.637 --> 39:17.004
Look, I've got money,
relax,

39:17.159 --> 39:19.079
I'll get..., 
I'll get the money.

39:25.379 --> 39:27.078
- Pappy, Leroy,

39:27.920 --> 39:30.560
says he's got it
but I ain't seen none yet.

39:32.369 --> 39:34.476
- What the hell are
y'all looking at?!

39:34.477 --> 39:36.697
Ain't you got nothing
better to do?!

39:39.045 --> 39:40.295
- Yeah.

39:41.878 --> 39:43.128
Right.

39:59.269 --> 40:01.369
- Somebody's in a
heap of trouble.

40:16.483 --> 40:17.733
- Get out.

40:19.296 --> 40:20.546
I said get out.

40:30.693 --> 40:31.943
- Hold it right.

43:01.315 --> 43:04.033
- Mister I don't know what
you're planning on doing to me.

43:04.034 --> 43:06.055
I mean I've got
money, I can get it

43:06.056 --> 43:08.057
for you right now I promise.
- Shut up.

43:08.058 --> 43:09.675
- No no no
no, listen to me.

43:09.676 --> 43:12.302
I've got a couple of grand
stashed back at the station.

43:12.303 --> 43:14.478
Take me back there now
I'll give it to you.

43:29.825 --> 43:32.501
- How would you see
a moccasin in this dark?

43:32.502 --> 43:35.986
- I don't know. Don't be
worrying about it 'til you see one.

43:35.987 --> 43:37.307
- Yeah right.

43:39.194 --> 43:40.444
- Hey,

43:40.597 --> 43:42.493
oh you're asking for it.

43:47.128 --> 43:49.468
Bet you're glad we
stole them candles.

44:07.859 --> 44:10.919
- How far you think
we are from happy log?

44:12.966 --> 44:14.895
- I... I think we're lost.

44:15.514 --> 44:17.674
I mean none of this
looks familiar.

44:21.005 --> 44:23.465
- Hey we gotta
be getting close.

44:51.921 --> 44:54.501
- This river just ain't
the same at night.

44:58.905 --> 45:00.155
- Yeah,

45:00.903 --> 45:02.293
it gives me creeps.

45:03.948 --> 45:05.808
Ain't like that in the daytime.

45:08.873 --> 45:10.973
- Let's just pretend
it's daytime.

45:15.214 --> 45:16.464
- I ain't scared,

45:16.644 --> 45:17.894
I ain't scared,

45:18.016 --> 45:20.211
no way,
no how.

45:32.600 --> 45:36.449
- You brought the smokes didn't you?
Tell me you at least did that.

45:36.450 --> 45:37.770
- Yeah I brought them,

45:38.218 --> 45:39.713
the man kind.

45:40.177 --> 45:42.725
Kind that'll grow
hair on your 'nads.

45:48.399 --> 45:51.449
- You telling me
you got $2,000 stashed

45:51.454 --> 45:54.130
at that little piss ant
gas station of yours?

45:54.131 --> 45:55.381
- Yes sir.

45:56.204 --> 45:57.644
- If you're lying to me.

45:59.985 --> 46:01.877
You know they pay me
just to rough you up

46:01.878 --> 46:03.918
a little bit, teach
you a lesson.

46:03.998 --> 46:06.278
So help me if that money
ain't there,

46:06.920 --> 46:08.170
I'll kill you.

46:38.635 --> 46:39.885
- Ben.

46:43.736 --> 46:45.533
I gotta level with
you on something.

46:45.534 --> 46:46.784
- Yeah, what?

46:48.671 --> 46:49.921
- Well,

46:51.423 --> 46:53.703
this river kinda
scares me a bit now.

46:55.222 --> 46:57.502
I ain't ever had
that feeling before.

46:58.897 --> 47:00.937
Paddling down the
river at night,

47:01.368 --> 47:03.228
I just thought of
something...

47:03.933 --> 47:05.549
awful,
like

47:05.851 --> 47:07.359
my dad's body

47:07.498 --> 47:10.395
being in this river
for three days.

47:10.677 --> 47:13.677
Do you know he even looked
like after three days?

47:14.833 --> 47:16.556
He didn't have no eyes Ben,

47:17.192 --> 47:18.442
fish got to him.

47:18.750 --> 47:21.690
And also gators took a
couple chunks of him too.

47:22.606 --> 47:25.246
Why do you think we
couldn't show his body?

47:25.355 --> 47:26.855
- Cory.
- You know what,

47:27.208 --> 47:29.284
I'm starting to hate this river.

47:29.538 --> 47:32.418
- Cory, you're dad's body
is not in this water.

47:33.072 --> 47:36.432
He's in Heaven with the good
Lord, I know that's right.

47:39.849 --> 47:41.099
- I miss him Ben,

47:41.696 --> 47:42.946
Mama does too.

47:43.198 --> 47:46.667
I hear her off in her
bedroom crying every night.

47:47.297 --> 47:48.737
I don't know what to do.

47:50.857 --> 47:53.377
- Hate hearing that
about your mama Cory.

47:53.658 --> 47:55.313
I know it's been
really hard on her.

47:55.314 --> 47:56.754
No man around the house.

47:57.709 --> 47:59.836
- What in hell are
you talking about?!

47:59.837 --> 48:02.636
What do you think I am?
I'm the man now,

48:02.853 --> 48:05.453
you get that?!
- Okay Cory I get it.

48:05.454 --> 48:07.473
- You seen other man
around my place?

48:07.474 --> 48:08.960
Damn it to hell Ben!

48:09.119 --> 48:11.486
- Okay Cory calm down I get it.

48:11.908 --> 48:14.128
You're the man around
the house now.

48:17.123 --> 48:19.565
- You ain't gonna tell
nobody about this are you?

48:19.566 --> 48:20.816
- No way no how.

48:22.446 --> 48:25.626
Just listen Cory, a man's
got feelings too you know.

48:26.533 --> 48:27.783
Hold up.

48:37.406 --> 48:38.656
Come on Cory.

48:39.718 --> 48:43.438
I gotta show you something I
been working on for a long time.

48:44.535 --> 48:47.775
I been thinking of the
perfect time to show you this.

48:50.114 --> 48:51.968
Ben and Cory,

48:52.900 --> 48:54.150
there's a lot more.

48:54.877 --> 48:56.127
- Damn.

48:57.962 --> 48:59.715
That's a lot of carving.

49:00.247 --> 49:01.627
- Best friends.

49:23.900 --> 49:25.700
- Darryl,
sorry to bother you.

49:25.850 --> 49:27.667
- Oh no on Mac,
come on in.

49:28.604 --> 49:29.854
So what's the word?

49:30.571 --> 49:34.171
- Well I drove by his house
and the shack, couple of times.

49:35.319 --> 49:37.059
I didn't see his car nowhere.

49:37.446 --> 49:39.066
- Not good.
- No it ain't.

49:39.500 --> 49:41.452
Now you know I hate
going in that joint

49:41.453 --> 49:43.373
start asking questions 'cause...

49:43.898 --> 49:46.613
ain't too many folks like
to see the law around there.

49:46.614 --> 49:48.922
- Maybe I aught to go down
there and ask a few questions.

49:48.923 --> 49:51.847
- Well that's exactly why I came.
I don't want you doing that Darryl.

49:51.848 --> 49:53.098
- Listen to him hun,

49:53.123 --> 49:55.649
I don't want you going down
there with those no-accounts.

49:55.674 --> 49:58.267
- You'd be surprised how many of
them no-accounts you might know.

49:58.268 --> 50:01.421
- Just the same, I don't want
you going down there you hear?

50:01.422 --> 50:02.700
- Listen to her Darryl.

50:02.701 --> 50:06.121
It's best you stay put and
let the law handle this okay.

50:06.713 --> 50:08.257
- Alright Mac, okay.

50:08.470 --> 50:10.148
Just keep us posted
though you hear?

50:10.149 --> 50:11.468
- Will do, Ma'am.

50:44.337 --> 50:45.587
- Man I'm hungry.

50:48.270 --> 50:49.590
- Boy how can that be?

50:49.960 --> 50:52.660
After all the fish we
caught this afternoon.

50:53.303 --> 50:54.553
- Very funny.

50:54.981 --> 50:57.206
- It was your idea to
live off the land.

50:57.207 --> 50:59.295
Now we're gonna starve to death.

51:05.549 --> 51:08.669
Wonder if anybody else is
camping out here tonight.

51:08.726 --> 51:12.174
- Nah I don't think so,
only killers and ex-cons.

51:15.292 --> 51:17.981
We're pretty deep in the woods.

51:21.335 --> 51:22.585
- What was that?

51:25.195 --> 51:26.455
- I don't know, shhh.

51:28.063 --> 51:30.088
Don't be getting all
scared on me now.

51:30.089 --> 51:31.339
- I ain't,

51:32.109 --> 51:35.500
oh Lord, I think God's
getting us for the candles.

51:36.693 --> 51:38.805
Somebody out there
is gonna kill us.

51:38.806 --> 51:41.866
- Would you be quiet damn
it I'm trying to listen.

51:47.610 --> 51:48.860
You okay?

51:49.520 --> 51:50.770
- Yeah Ben,

51:51.556 --> 51:52.806
I think so.

52:14.927 --> 52:17.013
- Come on,
get us right there.

52:17.927 --> 52:19.177
Open that door.

52:28.272 --> 52:30.870
- Okay I'm gonna get this for you
so you can go on our way okay.

52:30.871 --> 52:33.003
I mean you're gonna
let me go right?

52:33.004 --> 52:35.824
- Let's just get to it,
I ain't got all night.

52:37.729 --> 52:38.979
Ah hell,

52:39.485 --> 52:41.225
I knew this was gonna happen.

52:43.334 --> 52:44.714
I ain't believing this!

52:45.105 --> 52:46.902
You bring me all
the way down here

52:46.903 --> 52:49.232
to play games with me,
with me!

52:49.325 --> 52:51.425
- But it was here
I'm telling you!

52:51.511 --> 52:52.761
- Get in the truck.

52:53.095 --> 52:55.031
- No you're gonna have
to shoot me right here.

52:56.487 --> 52:58.909
- Hell that wouldn't
be no fun now would it?

52:58.910 --> 53:00.160
Get in the truck.

53:00.258 --> 53:02.538
- What are you
gonna do to me?

54:05.584 --> 54:08.750
- You know what Ben,
I think we're being sissies.

54:08.906 --> 54:11.682
I mean what's gonna
get us out here anyway?

54:12.821 --> 54:16.121
Let's put our lines in, ain't
nothing to be scared of.

54:18.802 --> 54:22.102
- Yeah I know, just a little
spooky out here you know.

54:22.387 --> 54:24.944
We're just letting the
river get the best of us.

54:24.945 --> 54:27.405
- Ben, I gotta
ask you something.

54:27.936 --> 54:29.186
- Yeah, what?

54:31.380 --> 54:32.635
- What was it like

54:32.640 --> 54:35.400
with all that saliva mixing
around and stuff?

54:37.596 --> 54:39.716
- I'm telling you
we didn't French.

54:39.741 --> 54:41.181
Why you asking all that?

54:42.059 --> 54:43.309
- Just wondering.

54:44.503 --> 54:47.083
If you ever did,
would you tell me?

54:47.860 --> 54:49.660
Just so I know what it's like.

54:57.107 --> 55:00.137
- What makes you think I'd
do it before you anyways?

55:00.162 --> 55:02.862
- With a baby on the way.

55:03.017 --> 55:04.267
- What?

55:05.626 --> 55:08.449
- You and Abigail are
practically married.

55:09.382 --> 55:10.882
- Cut it out man.

55:11.619 --> 55:14.420
- She ain't all that bad.

55:15.177 --> 55:16.427
- Yeah I know.

55:17.116 --> 55:19.116
But I saw her mama in
church the other day

55:19.117 --> 55:20.580
and I got to thinking,

55:21.353 --> 55:23.333
she's kinda fat and all.
- Yeah?

55:24.898 --> 55:27.025
- I think that's how
Abigail might turn out

55:27.026 --> 55:28.466
and that would scare me.

55:28.991 --> 55:31.463
Here we are married,
sleeping one day,

55:32.126 --> 55:34.346
she just rolls over
and squashes me.

55:46.650 --> 55:48.810
- Oh ain't nothing
to be scared of.

55:49.148 --> 55:51.090
Stick your head
outside of the tent

55:51.091 --> 55:53.889
and see if anybody out
there wants to kill us.

56:22.867 --> 56:25.987
I'm gonna catch something
this time, I can feel it.

56:26.250 --> 56:27.930
- Look at the lightning bug,

56:28.611 --> 56:29.861
you see it?

56:43.033 --> 56:44.283
Alligator!

57:00.465 --> 57:03.405
- Hey can you get
those matches? - Yeah.

57:07.041 --> 57:08.291
Cory,

57:09.704 --> 57:11.984
we're best friends right?
- Sure why?

57:12.648 --> 57:15.703
- I don't know, something
about hearing it you know.

57:15.704 --> 57:17.504
Just makes a body feel better.

57:17.956 --> 57:20.402
My dad said if you
have one good friend,

57:20.403 --> 57:22.319
you're the richest
man in the world.

57:22.320 --> 57:23.880
- Then I'm a rich man Ben.

57:42.879 --> 57:45.039
My daddy must have
been awful rich.

57:45.653 --> 57:47.267
He had a lot of friends.

57:49.155 --> 57:50.775
Not an enemy in this world.

57:52.004 --> 57:53.717
Except maybe one.

57:59.551 --> 58:00.991
If I tell you something,

58:01.256 --> 58:03.116
you promise not to tell anyone?

58:03.267 --> 58:04.517
'Cause if you do...

58:08.195 --> 58:10.181
the sheriff might
come arrest me.

58:10.182 --> 58:11.905
- Okay, I promise.

58:12.930 --> 58:14.180
- Well,

58:14.911 --> 58:16.591
having these dreams at night

58:17.953 --> 58:19.943
about,
finding this guy

58:21.099 --> 58:23.019
and killing him.
- You serious?

58:24.539 --> 58:25.789
- Damn right.

58:26.884 --> 58:28.624
My daddy got shot in the back

58:29.997 --> 58:31.677
and I ain't standing for it.

58:32.501 --> 58:35.321
- And you got on to me
about stealing candles.

58:36.227 --> 58:38.687
That ain't even breaking
no commandment.

58:39.707 --> 58:43.067
I think the worst thing is
when you go to killing folk.

58:43.099 --> 58:45.799
The fourth commandment,
thou shalt not kill.

58:46.617 --> 58:48.659
- You meant the
sixth commandment?

58:48.660 --> 58:51.614
- I mean at our age, how many
commandments we gotta break

58:51.615 --> 58:53.415
before we go straight to hell?

58:54.484 --> 58:55.734
- Next to none.

58:58.858 --> 59:00.959
- I think it's
better to die young.

59:00.960 --> 59:04.440
That way you ain't got as much
time to screw up you know.

59:04.773 --> 59:07.653
- Yeah I ain't in no
hurry to get to Heaven.

59:08.856 --> 59:10.476
'Cause you gotta die first.

59:10.600 --> 59:12.334
- Yeah who wants to die?

59:14.181 --> 59:15.431
- All right.

59:15.924 --> 59:18.082
I don't want to talk
about it anymore Ben.

59:18.083 --> 59:19.333
- Okay.

59:19.391 --> 59:21.437
We should just
go to sleep you know

59:21.438 --> 59:24.205
everything will look
different in the morning.

59:24.206 --> 59:25.456
- Yeah you're right.

59:27.332 --> 59:29.184
well, goodnight buddy.

59:29.652 --> 59:30.902
- Goodnight Cory.

59:45.310 --> 59:46.560
- Ben?

59:46.666 --> 59:48.529
- What, what, what?

59:51.015 --> 59:54.135
- Don't dream about Abigail
tonight. - Don't start.

01:01:24.837 --> 01:01:26.087
- How do?

01:01:27.876 --> 01:01:30.370
- A little out of your way
coming out here ain't you?

01:01:33.076 --> 01:01:35.596
- Well I'm looking for
a fella named Ned.

01:01:35.658 --> 01:01:37.458
I know he comes in here a lot.

01:01:42.542 --> 01:01:43.792
- So what?

01:01:45.942 --> 01:01:47.192
- Well uh...

01:01:47.852 --> 01:01:49.102
he's gone missing

01:01:49.615 --> 01:01:50.995
and folks are worrying.

01:01:52.479 --> 01:01:53.859
I'm aiming to find him.

01:01:54.601 --> 01:01:57.181
- I know who Ned is,
but I ain't seen him.

01:02:02.686 --> 01:02:03.936
- Alright,

01:02:05.224 --> 01:02:06.474
supposing you...

01:02:07.376 --> 01:02:09.176
give us a call if he comes in.

01:02:10.275 --> 01:02:12.615
Fair enough?
? Broken hearted salmon ?

01:02:33.156 --> 01:02:36.151
- Where are the matches?
- I don't know you had them.

01:02:36.152 --> 01:02:38.012
- I thought I gave them to you.

01:02:39.984 --> 01:02:41.603
Who has them then?

01:02:42.710 --> 01:02:44.510
- Right in front of your face.

01:02:48.351 --> 01:02:49.601
Hurry up!

01:03:04.892 --> 01:03:06.571
- Okay, what was that?

01:03:07.167 --> 01:03:08.487
- I don't know listen.

01:03:09.593 --> 01:03:10.843
That was a car.

01:03:11.045 --> 01:03:14.149
There ain't no roads
back here, I don't think.

01:03:14.470 --> 01:03:16.390
You know of any roads back here?

01:03:16.474 --> 01:03:17.724
- Nuh uh.

01:03:18.037 --> 01:03:19.287
- Me either.

01:03:19.787 --> 01:03:21.318
- You think it was the cops?

01:03:21.343 --> 01:03:24.823
- What would the cops be doing
way out here on the river?

01:03:25.498 --> 01:03:26.748
- Ben,

01:03:27.883 --> 01:03:29.133
I don't like this.

01:03:31.168 --> 01:03:32.418
- Yeah me either.

01:03:40.991 --> 01:03:42.791
Holy cow, blow the candle out.

01:03:57.096 --> 01:03:58.346
Listen.

01:04:00.902 --> 01:04:03.962
Can't tell what direction
the motor's coming from.

01:04:04.193 --> 01:04:05.990
- Bless me Father
for I have sinned.

01:04:05.991 --> 01:04:08.094
Please get us for
stealing the candles.

01:04:08.095 --> 01:04:11.304
I mean please don't send us
to Hell. We'll settle for Purgatory.

01:04:11.305 --> 01:04:14.605
Oh and one more thing, sorry
about stealing the canoe.

01:04:14.842 --> 01:04:16.092
Amen.

01:04:19.352 --> 01:04:20.733
- I hope He's listening.

01:04:33.646 --> 01:04:34.896
- Oh hell.

01:04:42.781 --> 01:04:45.811
- Go, go ahead, stick your head
out there. See if you see anything.

01:04:45.812 --> 01:04:47.593
- You gotta be kidding me.

01:04:47.594 --> 01:04:49.514
- Go on don't be afraid.

01:04:49.517 --> 01:04:52.577
- Well then you
stick your head out there.

01:05:04.944 --> 01:05:06.194
Ow!

01:05:22.751 --> 01:05:25.871
- Going for a
little midnight swim are we?

01:05:26.342 --> 01:05:28.982
- Why don't you just
go ahead and shoot me!

01:05:29.913 --> 01:05:31.808
Shoot me damn it!
- Move!

01:05:43.518 --> 01:05:45.258
- I want to go home.

01:05:46.589 --> 01:05:48.089
- Wait, wait, Cory, Cory.

01:06:00.472 --> 01:06:01.722
Okay.

01:06:04.489 --> 01:06:05.809
I don't hear anything.

01:06:36.221 --> 01:06:37.471
- Man what a night.

01:06:37.824 --> 01:06:40.824
I tell you, I wouldn't
want to be in Ned's shoes.

01:06:41.036 --> 01:06:44.576
- What are you doing around here?
Ain't this your day off?

01:06:47.526 --> 01:06:49.146
- Ain't nothing else to do.

01:06:49.658 --> 01:06:51.496
- What'd you do rob a bank?

01:06:53.416 --> 01:06:54.736
- Something like that.

01:06:58.623 --> 01:07:00.267
- Hey,

01:07:00.844 --> 01:07:03.008
- Don't be asking
questions around here.

01:07:03.009 --> 01:07:05.931
You screw up you end
up at Harpers Bank.

01:07:07.942 --> 01:07:09.742
- Is that where they took Ned?

01:07:11.569 --> 01:07:14.066
- This guy just doesn't get it.

01:07:16.142 --> 01:07:17.976
- Yeah,

01:07:27.970 --> 01:07:31.510
- Yep you and me is gonna have

But you're gonna talk,

01:07:44.307 --> 01:07:45.684
one way or another.

01:07:50.464 --> 01:07:51.714
- Ben,

01:07:53.668 --> 01:07:54.918
I'm scared.

01:07:56.712 --> 01:07:58.812
Bless me Father for
I have sinned.

01:07:59.413 --> 01:08:01.758
Hallowed by they name.
Hail Mary!

01:08:01.986 --> 01:08:03.236
- Shut up.

01:08:08.933 --> 01:08:10.744
Pipe down they'll hear you.

01:08:14.743 --> 01:08:17.323
- You say one word
and it'll be your last.

01:08:33.300 --> 01:08:35.546
- We'll just have to
lay low 'til morning.

01:08:44.832 --> 01:08:46.212
- Come on out of there!

01:08:50.135 --> 01:08:52.295
I ain't gonna say
it a second time.

01:08:55.581 --> 01:08:57.426
- Oh God mister
please don't shoot us.

01:08:57.428 --> 01:08:59.495
We're just fishing,
we ain't seen nothing.

01:08:59.496 --> 01:09:02.113
- Yeah really mister we
ain't seen nothing honest.

01:09:02.115 --> 01:09:04.618
- We're alter boys and
we ain't supposed to lie.

01:09:04.618 --> 01:09:06.899
We haven't even seen
the guy tied up.

01:09:07.765 --> 01:09:09.015
- No.

01:09:09.287 --> 01:09:13.151
- I believe you boys in the
wrong place at the wrong time.

01:09:14.314 --> 01:09:17.435
Anybody else out here with you?
- No sir. - No sir.

01:09:18.441 --> 01:09:22.256
- Don't you be lying to me,
I'll blast your heads right off.

01:09:23.550 --> 01:09:25.229
Move!
- Yes sir. - Yes sir.

01:09:35.285 --> 01:09:38.404
- Alright boys you don't
need to be looking at him.

01:09:38.505 --> 01:09:39.755
Get on over there.

01:09:43.133 --> 01:09:44.803
Get over there by that tree.

01:09:44.804 --> 01:09:46.054
- Yes sir.

01:09:47.798 --> 01:09:50.254

01:09:50.255 --> 01:09:52.216
- Bless me Father
for I have sinned.

01:09:52.890 --> 01:09:54.169
- What'd you say?

01:09:54.194 --> 01:09:56.428
- Oh shit mister, he
ain't said nothing really.

01:09:56.429 --> 01:10:00.089
He's just scared, he always
talks to Jesus when he's scared.

01:10:02.227 --> 01:10:04.031
- What a bunch of sissies.

01:10:07.678 --> 01:10:09.058
What you scared of boy?

01:10:10.142 --> 01:10:12.002
This could be your lucky night.

01:10:12.822 --> 01:10:16.122
You might just get to see
Jesus sooner than you think.

01:10:44.226 --> 01:10:47.266
Say one word and I'll shoot
all three of you,

01:10:48.466 --> 01:10:49.716
and them too.

01:11:10.661 --> 01:11:11.921
- You catch anything?

01:12:01.978 --> 01:12:03.228
- Look Bud,

01:12:03.575 --> 01:12:05.572
I know you've got some cash.

01:12:12.829 --> 01:12:14.414
You got 10 seconds.

01:12:17.657 --> 01:12:18.907
- Wait,

01:12:18.945 --> 01:12:21.945
this has gone far enough.
You can have the money.

01:12:22.769 --> 01:12:25.109
It's in the file
cabinet in my office.

01:12:25.152 --> 01:12:26.772
Keys are in the top drawer.

01:13:01.273 --> 01:13:03.613
- What can I get you?
- Uh...

01:13:03.855 --> 01:13:05.105
give me a vodka.

01:13:11.869 --> 01:13:13.271
- Hey I seen you around.

01:13:13.272 --> 01:13:15.372
Don't you work at
the gas station?

01:13:15.472 --> 01:13:17.812
- Yeah my name's Darryl,
I work there.

01:13:17.889 --> 01:13:19.149
Been there for years.

01:13:20.524 --> 01:13:22.113
I thought I might
come around here

01:13:22.114 --> 01:13:24.274
and see if the boss
man was around.

01:13:24.676 --> 01:13:26.536
- Well now take a look at here.

01:13:26.792 --> 01:13:29.087
- I'm looking for Ned,
he ain't showed up today.

01:13:29.088 --> 01:13:30.898
So I figured he might
have come over here.

01:13:30.899 --> 01:13:32.149
You seen him?
- No.

01:13:33.077 --> 01:13:34.397
Can't say that I have.

01:13:35.016 --> 01:13:36.516
Not my turn to watch him.

01:13:40.043 --> 01:13:42.143
- Hey Leroy,
top me off would you?

01:13:42.152 --> 01:13:43.402
- Sure thing.

01:13:45.526 --> 01:13:48.046
- Hey I know it's not
much of my business

01:13:48.082 --> 01:13:50.302
but I don't know
what Clyde's doing,

01:13:50.615 --> 01:13:52.115
but Ned was here earlier.

01:13:53.350 --> 01:13:55.068
You know me and Ned we
was real good friends,

01:13:55.069 --> 01:13:56.449
been friends for years.

01:13:56.627 --> 01:13:59.267
I know he owes a lot
of money to the house.

01:13:59.566 --> 01:14:00.826
Something's going on.

01:14:02.708 --> 01:14:05.486
- How long ago was earlier?
- Well...

01:14:06.308 --> 01:14:09.735
probably a couple of hours ago.
But I never seen him leave

01:14:09.736 --> 01:14:13.276
'cause I been losing and giving
all my money to the house.

01:14:16.081 --> 01:14:17.761
- So you ain't seen him huh?

01:14:18.635 --> 01:14:19.885
- Seen who?

01:14:20.757 --> 01:14:22.503
- Ned.
- Oh Ned,

01:14:23.368 --> 01:14:25.528
last time I saw him
was your place.

01:14:30.852 --> 01:14:32.102
- Alright.

01:14:36.958 --> 01:14:38.208
Thank you hear.

01:15:00.254 --> 01:15:02.772
- I ain't believing my eyes,
where'd you boys come from?

01:15:02.773 --> 01:15:04.425
- Us, us,

01:15:04.837 --> 01:15:08.264
we been out here all night fishing,
minding our own business!

01:15:08.265 --> 01:15:10.965
- And you come and scare
the hell out of us!

01:15:11.161 --> 01:15:13.646
Sweet Jesus,
he's gonna kill us!

01:15:13.996 --> 01:15:15.796
Yep that's what he's gonna do.

01:15:15.902 --> 01:15:18.387
- Cory, don't get your
nerves in the dirt again.

01:15:18.388 --> 01:15:21.953
- Boys we gotta keep a cool head
and figure a way out of this.

01:15:21.954 --> 01:15:24.706
I can't... budge this
rope it's too tight.

01:15:25.046 --> 01:15:26.296
- Me too,

01:15:26.593 --> 01:15:27.843
wait,

01:15:27.982 --> 01:15:29.422
I... think mine's loose.

01:15:30.596 --> 01:15:31.846
I think mine is...

01:15:32.104 --> 01:15:33.354
loose too.

01:15:35.084 --> 01:15:36.334
I got it,

01:15:36.739 --> 01:15:39.905
oh thank you God.
- Cory, shut up and untie us.

01:15:46.187 --> 01:15:47.437
Argh!

01:15:47.582 --> 01:15:49.604
- Ben I can't untie it.

01:15:50.376 --> 01:15:52.896
- In the tent,
I got a knife in the tent.

01:16:20.680 --> 01:16:23.800
- Ned, how'd you get mixed
up with a guy like that?

01:16:24.138 --> 01:16:26.419
- I owe somebody some
money that I can't pay

01:16:26.420 --> 01:16:29.003
and they sent somebody to kill me.
- Kill you?

01:16:29.004 --> 01:16:32.034
- Well I sure as hell don't want
to hang around her to find out.

01:16:32.035 --> 01:16:34.658
I wish he'd hurry up and find
that knife and come cut me loose.

01:16:34.659 --> 01:16:36.614
- Cory, hurry up!

01:16:37.044 --> 01:16:38.664
- I can't find it!

01:16:39.121 --> 01:16:41.401
- What do you mean
you can't find it?

01:16:41.502 --> 01:16:42.752
It's in the tent.

01:16:43.759 --> 01:16:46.999
- I begged him to drive to
the station and let me go.

01:16:47.630 --> 01:16:50.176
- Y'all went to the station?
- Yeah and

01:16:50.260 --> 01:16:52.313
when I got to the office
to get the money out

01:16:52.314 --> 01:16:53.564
it was gone.

01:16:54.588 --> 01:16:57.528
And I thought he was gonna
shoot me right there.

01:16:57.784 --> 01:16:59.507
I don't understand
where that money got to.

01:16:59.508 --> 01:17:01.346
I mean I didn't tell
anybody about my stash.

01:17:01.347 --> 01:17:03.027
I didn't even tell your dad.

01:17:04.719 --> 01:17:07.179
No he's a good man,
he wouldn't do that.

01:17:08.379 --> 01:17:11.079
- I'm telling you Ben,
it ain't here.

01:17:11.676 --> 01:17:13.392
Ben, Ben it ain't here!

01:17:39.374 --> 01:17:41.534
- You looking for
something mister?

01:17:44.593 --> 01:17:46.446
You ain't got no business here.

01:17:46.447 --> 01:17:47.905
- Oh it's you.

01:17:48.317 --> 01:17:51.067
- Yeah well you can put your
hands out and don't move.

01:17:51.068 --> 01:17:52.448
I'm calling the police.

01:17:53.570 --> 01:17:55.730
- I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

01:17:55.905 --> 01:17:59.445
- Yeah well you're not calling
the shots here are you pal?

01:18:00.666 --> 01:18:02.365
- You want to see
your boss alive

01:18:02.366 --> 01:18:03.986
you'll put that phone
down.

01:18:04.991 --> 01:18:07.010
Got a couple of kids
you just might know

01:18:07.011 --> 01:18:08.931
that'll come up missing
as well.

01:18:09.675 --> 01:18:12.216
- What the hell are you
talking about, what kids?

01:18:12.217 --> 01:18:13.704
- I believe you got
a couple of boys

01:18:13.705 --> 01:18:15.505
out fishing tonight ain't you?

01:18:16.336 --> 01:18:17.586
- You got the boys?

01:18:18.897 --> 01:18:20.967
Where the hell are they?
If you hurt them...

01:18:20.968 --> 01:18:22.218
- Pipe down,

01:18:22.600 --> 01:18:23.920
I'll take you to them.

01:18:24.769 --> 01:18:27.829
You just need to show me
where he hides his stash.

01:18:28.461 --> 01:18:30.526
- What the hell are
you talking about?

01:18:30.527 --> 01:18:32.747
I don't know nothing
about no stash.

01:18:32.793 --> 01:18:34.533
He ain't got no money around.

01:18:39.049 --> 01:18:40.299
- Well hell,

01:18:40.614 --> 01:18:43.422
somebody's lying.
And I hate a liar!

01:18:51.326 --> 01:18:52.576
Move!

01:18:58.899 --> 01:19:00.785
- I'm telling you,
it ain't here.

01:19:00.810 --> 01:19:02.872
Damn it Ben,
it ain't here.

01:19:03.666 --> 01:19:05.489
- Well then grab a
stick from the fire.

01:19:05.490 --> 01:19:07.410
We'll burn it off if we have to.

01:19:47.421 --> 01:19:49.238
- What's going on here?

01:19:49.948 --> 01:19:51.613
- Man are we glad to see you.

01:19:51.614 --> 01:19:53.402
- It's okay mister.
- You got a knife?

01:19:53.403 --> 01:19:55.702
I don't want to burn him.
- Please mister untie us please.

01:20:01.769 --> 01:20:03.019
Shhh, listen,

01:20:03.819 --> 01:20:05.069
are y'all armed?

01:20:05.134 --> 01:20:07.099
Because if you're not
we're in trouble.

01:20:10.422 --> 01:20:12.822
- Here he comes,
come on Cory let's go.

01:20:18.149 --> 01:20:19.399
- Watch it Ben!

01:20:23.997 --> 01:20:25.247
- You hit my boy.

01:20:36.576 --> 01:20:38.090
Ben. Ben.

01:20:38.491 --> 01:20:39.741
Oh Jesus.

01:20:46.029 --> 01:20:47.926
Ben, oh God.

01:20:55.638 --> 01:20:57.185
- Y'all get out of that boat.

01:20:58.282 --> 01:20:59.532
- Oh my God,

01:21:00.131 --> 01:21:01.381
please.

01:21:02.765 --> 01:21:04.015
- No,

01:21:04.752 --> 01:21:06.002
no don't shoot.

01:21:20.046 --> 01:21:23.481
- Take another step and I'll
blow your damn head off.

01:21:23.951 --> 01:21:25.201
Drop it.

01:21:59.901 --> 01:22:02.421
- You killed him,
you killed him!

01:22:02.613 --> 01:22:03.863
I'm gonna kill him!

01:22:04.367 --> 01:22:05.617
- Cory, Cory,

01:22:06.411 --> 01:22:07.661
Cory, stop it.

01:22:07.975 --> 01:22:10.615
Mister your beef is
with me not these kids.

01:22:11.144 --> 01:22:12.861
- Get back over there.

01:22:17.155 --> 01:22:19.135
Come on hot shot,
get over here.

01:22:22.922 --> 01:22:25.373
- Don't move,
drop the gun.

01:22:29.110 --> 01:22:30.360
Get off the boy.

01:22:33.092 --> 01:22:34.712
What's wrong with that boy?

01:22:34.760 --> 01:22:36.382
- Bastard run him over.

01:22:36.383 --> 01:22:38.603
We need to get to
the hospital fast.

01:22:38.635 --> 01:22:41.279
- Give him they keys,
real slow like,

01:22:41.434 --> 01:22:43.189
or I'll blow your head off.

01:22:47.810 --> 01:22:49.383
- You good for nothing.

01:22:52.024 --> 01:22:53.274
Here,

01:22:55.247 --> 01:22:56.987
my car's on the main highway.

01:22:57.592 --> 01:22:58.842
You better get.

01:23:00.534 --> 01:23:02.689
- Cory, are their
any blankets in the tent?

01:23:02.690 --> 01:23:04.951
- Yes sir.
- Well go fetch them quick.

01:23:07.175 --> 01:23:09.278
- I figured you to be a low life,

01:23:09.993 --> 01:23:11.553
but running down that kid.

01:23:19.570 --> 01:23:20.820
Now hand it over,

01:23:21.749 --> 01:23:23.609
I know they paid you something.

01:23:23.829 --> 01:23:27.009
But you won't have no use
for it where you're going.

01:23:35.453 --> 01:23:36.703
Wow!

01:23:37.710 --> 01:23:38.960
Pay day.

01:23:40.235 --> 01:23:42.155
Is this what you're looking for,

01:23:42.612 --> 01:23:43.862
a little gas money?

01:23:47.838 --> 01:23:49.278
I ain't a scared of you,

01:23:50.284 --> 01:23:52.264
you're gonna die.
- Wait Mister,

01:23:53.424 --> 01:23:54.674
I want to kill him.

01:23:59.182 --> 01:24:00.432
- No son,

01:24:00.722 --> 01:24:02.470
this ain't none of your business.

01:24:02.471 --> 01:24:05.528
- I think he killed my daddy
and I'm aiming to find out.

01:24:08.163 --> 01:24:09.413
Watch it!

01:24:10.168 --> 01:24:11.418
- I be damned.

01:24:11.633 --> 01:24:12.883
- Get the door Cory.

01:24:18.728 --> 01:24:20.630
Help me Ned, please.

01:24:25.061 --> 01:24:26.311
Go Ned go!

01:24:28.479 --> 01:24:29.729
Stay with me son,

01:24:30.393 --> 01:24:31.643
you're doing great.

01:24:32.192 --> 01:24:33.442
Daddy's right here.

01:25:01.359 --> 01:25:02.609
Daddy's right here.

01:25:29.802 --> 01:25:31.102
- Dr. Jane Hamilton.

01:25:34.147 --> 01:25:36.323
<i>- Biloxi unit 31
are you almost there?</i>

01:25:36.324 --> 01:25:38.568
<i>We've been receiving
several calls on this.</i>

01:25:38.569 --> 01:25:39.819
- 10 four.

01:26:05.020 --> 01:26:06.270
- Darryl.

01:26:07.345 --> 01:26:08.595
- My boy's gone Mac,

01:26:09.840 --> 01:26:11.090
my boy's gone.

01:26:13.179 --> 01:26:15.330
What am I gonna tell
his mama?

01:26:16.114 --> 01:26:19.234
- I just sent another car
for her she's on her way.

01:26:23.215 --> 01:26:24.465
- Cory.

01:26:24.589 --> 01:26:26.104
- Move it scum bag.

01:26:26.667 --> 01:26:29.736
- You ain't gonna kill nobody,
you ain't got the guts.

01:26:31.707 --> 01:26:34.959
It takes a man to kill another
man and you ain't no man.

01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:37.060
- I'm tired of hearing
your mouth,

01:26:37.363 --> 01:26:39.177
turn around.
- Argh.

01:26:41.505 --> 01:26:42.755
Now move it.

01:27:16.429 --> 01:27:17.679
Turn around.

01:27:24.905 --> 01:27:27.425
- Drop the gun!
- I can't do that.

01:27:27.714 --> 01:27:28.974
- Drop the gun Clyde.

01:27:30.563 --> 01:27:31.813
I said drop it!

01:27:33.297 --> 01:27:34.547
- How's the boy?

01:27:34.735 --> 01:27:35.985
- He's dead.

01:27:36.494 --> 01:27:38.474
- Don't do it Mister,
I mean it.

01:27:39.345 --> 01:27:40.605
You put the gun down.

01:27:42.194 --> 01:27:45.324
Put it on the ground,
nice and easy and step away.

01:27:45.444 --> 01:27:47.184
- This man just killed a kid,

01:27:47.882 --> 01:27:49.982
he's got to die.
- I said drop it!

01:27:53.408 --> 01:27:54.658
- Okay,

01:27:55.153 --> 01:27:57.073
but you're making a big mistake.

01:27:59.850 --> 01:28:01.100
- Well I'm not!

01:28:02.328 --> 01:28:04.979
- Cory no.
- Give him what he deserves.

01:28:05.372 --> 01:28:06.632
- Best friend's dead.

01:28:07.922 --> 01:28:09.242
Give me the money now.

01:28:09.814 --> 01:28:11.581
- What?
- I said

01:28:12.003 --> 01:28:13.417
give me the money now!

01:28:14.020 --> 01:28:15.591
- Cory, stop!

01:28:20.529 --> 01:28:21.849
- This is blood money,

01:28:22.532 --> 01:28:24.752
the money that killed
my best friend.

01:28:25.796 --> 01:28:28.616
And it's gonna burn in
hell like you're gonna.

01:28:39.488 --> 01:28:42.488
Now give me Ned's money,
I know you got that too.

01:29:01.356 --> 01:29:04.161
Did you kill my daddy?
- Cory, stop!

01:29:04.985 --> 01:29:07.145
- I know you killed
my best friend.

01:29:10.052 --> 01:29:11.492
Do you know how to pray?

01:29:13.808 --> 01:29:15.668
I said do you know how to pray?

01:29:18.475 --> 01:29:20.095
Well it's time you learned,

01:29:21.126 --> 01:29:23.982
'cause tonight,
you're gonna meet Jesus.

01:29:26.751 --> 01:29:28.192
- You put the gun down.

01:29:28.193 --> 01:29:29.443
- Repeat after me,

01:29:29.703 --> 01:29:31.083
the Lord is my shepard.

01:29:31.154 --> 01:29:32.725
- Cory stop.
- Jesus!

01:29:33.604 --> 01:29:35.464
- You got the first part right.

01:29:36.591 --> 01:29:37.841
Walk you bastard!

01:29:40.185 --> 01:29:41.435
Move!

01:29:44.863 --> 01:29:46.113
- Y'all stay put.

01:30:00.816 --> 01:30:02.753
- Say I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

01:30:18.570 --> 01:30:20.106
Say I'm sorry.

01:30:21.354 --> 01:30:23.274
- Cory don't,
Cory stop!

01:30:23.410 --> 01:30:26.320
- I'm sorry,
I'm so sorry, God please.

01:30:35.912 --> 01:30:37.162
- Cory no!

01:30:44.528 --> 01:30:46.552
- I think it's
better to die young.

01:30:46.553 --> 01:30:50.033
That way you ain't got as much
time to screw up you know.

01:30:50.398 --> 01:30:53.311
- Yeah, I ain't in no
hurry to get to Heaven.

01:30:54.358 --> 01:30:56.069
'Cause you gotta die first.

01:30:56.309 --> 01:30:57.975
- Yeah who wants to die?

01:30:59.001 --> 01:31:00.251
- Cory no!

01:31:13.188 --> 01:31:14.571
Get up, get up.

01:31:46.285 --> 01:31:49.285
- My dad said,
if you have one good friend

01:31:50.781 --> 01:31:53.001
you're the richest
man in the world.

01:31:53.665 --> 01:31:55.765
- Then I'm
a rich man Ben.

01:31:55.766 --> 01:31:57.386
- Same to you Cory.

01:32:18.170 --> 01:32:19.420
- Hey Ben,

01:32:20.051 --> 01:32:21.301
it's me,

01:32:21.750 --> 01:32:23.000
I'm back.

01:32:24.734 --> 01:32:26.954
And you won't believe
who's with me.

01:32:33.961 --> 01:32:35.521
Went fishing this morning.

01:32:37.313 --> 01:32:38.563
As usual

01:32:39.134 --> 01:32:40.394
didn't catch nothing.

01:32:42.617 --> 01:32:44.597
Guess y'all don't fish in Heaven.

01:32:52.331 --> 01:32:53.676
Seeing a doctor now.

01:32:55.792 --> 01:32:58.069
Something they call
a psychiatrist.

01:33:02.368 --> 01:33:04.202
He gives me the creeps.

01:33:08.539 --> 01:33:10.339
We just sit there for an hour,

01:33:12.223 --> 01:33:13.473
quiet like.

01:33:19.563 --> 01:33:20.813
Well,

01:33:21.130 --> 01:33:23.110
guess I'll see you
tomorrow Ben.

01:33:31.563 --> 01:33:32.813
You know Abigail

01:33:33.684 --> 01:33:35.064
I do know you're there.

01:33:40.881 --> 01:33:43.496
No, no!

01:37:40.825 --> 01:37:42.825
The End

01:37:43.118 --> 01:37:45.618
