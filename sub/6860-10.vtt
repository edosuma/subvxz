10:55.281 --> 10:56.381
[laser warbles]

10:56.416 --> 10:58.316
Oh, do not forget
to lock down your--

10:58.351 --> 11:01.653
[laser zapping]

11:01.687 --> 11:02.653
[droid clangs]

11:02.688 --> 11:03.721
[laser warbles and zaps]

11:08.160 --> 11:12.931
Sir, there was a temporary
power loss on "C" deck.

11:12.965 --> 11:15.133
[electronic voice] Has
the power been reestablished?

11:15.168 --> 11:16.701
Yes.

11:16.736 --> 11:19.037
It was only a temporary fluctuation.

11:19.071 --> 11:22.140
[electronic voice] Hmm, curious.

11:22.174 --> 11:24.276
[U9-C4 whirs and beeps]

11:24.310 --> 11:25.710
All right, listen up.

11:25.745 --> 11:26.711
Cutting the power

11:26.746 --> 11:28.513
put the comm-vault
security system

11:28.547 --> 11:30.415
in manual override.

11:30.449 --> 11:32.183
But someone still has to distract

11:32.218 --> 11:33.685
some super battle droids.

11:33.719 --> 11:35.487
Oh, please, please, please.

11:35.554 --> 11:36.688
Let me do it, come on, come on,

11:36.722 --> 11:40.024
come on, come on, let me do it, please.

11:40.059 --> 11:41.025
Come on, come on.

11:41.060 --> 11:42.027
[sighs]

11:42.061 --> 11:43.128
All right.

11:43.162 --> 11:45.497
You will not regret this, corporal.

11:45.531 --> 11:47.532
I am not a...

11:50.002 --> 11:52.971
[humming]

11:53.005 --> 11:54.406
[mechanical whirring]

11:54.440 --> 11:56.174
[electronic voice] Halt.

11:56.209 --> 11:58.209
I have been ordered by General Grievous

11:58.244 --> 11:59.811
to test comm-vault security.

11:59.845 --> 12:01.680
And I need your help.

12:01.714 --> 12:03.715
Now, follow me.

12:03.750 --> 12:06.752
[mechanical whirring]

12:08.922 --> 12:10.989
[door whirs]

12:11.024 --> 12:13.358
Now, I will go inside
the comm-vault

12:13.393 --> 12:15.160
and send out a power surge.

12:15.195 --> 12:16.328
[droids whirring and beeping]

12:16.396 --> 12:17.829
I need you two to stay here.

12:17.864 --> 12:20.866
[mechanical whirring]

12:22.369 --> 12:24.670
It will not be safe for you
while I am working.

12:24.704 --> 12:26.205
Are we clear?

12:26.239 --> 12:27.506
[electronic voice]
Yes, but--

12:27.541 --> 12:28.507
- Good.

12:28.542 --> 12:29.508
That is what I like:

12:29.543 --> 12:30.710
no questions.

12:30.744 --> 12:33.179
[electronic voice] Huh?

12:33.213 --> 12:34.847
[door whirs, droids beep]

12:34.881 --> 12:37.150
Thank you, thank you,
thank you very much.

12:37.184 --> 12:38.150
Shh.

12:38.185 --> 12:39.151
Quiet.

12:39.186 --> 12:40.687
We need to keep moving.

12:40.721 --> 12:43.423
Beezee, open the comm-vault
security door.

12:43.457 --> 12:45.658
Uh, make sure it
is not booby-trapped.

12:45.693 --> 12:46.793
[mechanical whirring]

12:46.827 --> 12:49.529
[electricity crackling
and droid beeping]

12:49.597 --> 12:50.897
clang!

12:50.931 --> 12:52.065
[sizzling]

12:52.099 --> 12:55.068
[coughing]

12:56.303 --> 12:58.271
You blockhead!

12:58.305 --> 13:01.541
Now we're going to lose manual override.

13:01.575 --> 13:04.944
You...you terminated Beezee.

13:04.979 --> 13:08.848
It's not my fault
he fried his circuitry.

13:08.882 --> 13:13.319
I didn't tell that nitwit
to attack the access panel.

13:13.353 --> 13:16.890
So what do we do now, Corporal?

13:19.293 --> 13:22.429
Look, we can still salvage this mission.

13:22.463 --> 13:23.797
If one of you could just--

13:23.832 --> 13:26.033
you need to reaccess that panel,

13:26.067 --> 13:29.636
and we have to open
that comm-vault door fast

13:29.671 --> 13:33.540
and grab the encryption module
before we're caught red-handed.

13:33.575 --> 13:34.975
[QT-KT beeps]

13:35.009 --> 13:37.577
No, I will not do it myself.

13:37.612 --> 13:38.946
I'm an officer.

13:38.980 --> 13:44.551
I've got no experience
in this type of crisis maneuver.

13:44.586 --> 13:47.054
You fought in the Battle of Geonosis.

13:47.089 --> 13:49.623
That did not prepare you for a crisis?

13:49.657 --> 13:54.061
Well, technically,
I didn't fight in that battle.

13:54.096 --> 13:57.097
I'm a military analyst
by trade and--

13:57.132 --> 13:58.932
- You are a map reader?

13:59.000 --> 14:01.435
[droids beeping]

14:01.469 --> 14:05.072
I am an accomplished
battlefield strategist.

14:05.106 --> 14:09.075
I analyze the enemy terrain
and plot a course to victory.

14:09.109 --> 14:11.144
In other words, you read maps.

14:11.178 --> 14:14.113
You're off base here, Cyclops!

14:14.147 --> 14:17.216
I was chosen for my fearsome cunning,

14:17.250 --> 14:22.387
although my size
may have played a small factor.

14:22.422 --> 14:24.022
[droids beeping]

14:24.057 --> 14:25.757
But do not think for a moment

14:25.792 --> 14:27.759
that Colonel Meebur Gascon

14:27.794 --> 14:31.396
is going to relinquish command
of this mission.

14:31.431 --> 14:34.566
I have waited a lifetime
for this opportunity,

14:34.600 --> 14:37.336
and some ragtag collection of droids

14:37.370 --> 14:40.272
is not going to deny me my destiny.

14:40.306 --> 14:41.674
So one way or another,

14:41.708 --> 14:44.009
I will open
that comm-vault door.

14:44.043 --> 14:46.845
[door whirs]

14:46.880 --> 14:50.816
Oh, there, just like I planned it.

14:52.485 --> 14:53.686
[stomps]

14:53.720 --> 14:56.122
Now, we're
going to infiltrate this vault,

14:56.156 --> 14:58.424
neutralize the swarm mines,

14:58.458 --> 15:00.693
and then secure the encryption module.

15:00.727 --> 15:02.161
Any questions?

15:02.195 --> 15:06.632
Have you ever been in a battle before?

15:06.666 --> 15:08.400
No, I have not.

15:08.434 --> 15:10.736
But if you'd care to see
what I'm made of,

15:10.770 --> 15:13.138
we can go to war right now, you and me,

15:13.172 --> 15:16.742
and probably get ourselves
captured by a Separatist.

15:16.776 --> 15:19.478
Or we can execute my plan

15:19.512 --> 15:22.514
and come out of this mission
looking like heroes.

15:22.548 --> 15:26.184
The choice is yours, Cyclops.

15:26.219 --> 15:27.853
[QT-KT beeps]

15:27.887 --> 15:29.521
[R2-D2 beeps]

15:29.556 --> 15:32.224
First of all, my name is WAC.

15:32.259 --> 15:35.762
Second of all,
we will execute your plan.

15:35.796 --> 15:40.065
But you have to stop calling us
stupid names, Shorty.

15:40.099 --> 15:43.101
[QT-KT beeps]

15:43.136 --> 15:44.102
[sighs]

15:44.137 --> 15:47.105
Very well, WAC.

15:47.139 --> 15:48.807
I'll play nice,

15:48.841 --> 15:52.444
but only until one of you
screws up again.

15:52.478 --> 15:55.447
[mechanical whirring]

16:01.854 --> 16:06.023
Sir, there has been another
disturbance on "C" deck.

16:06.058 --> 16:07.859
[electronic voice] I will investigate

16:07.893 --> 16:10.895
this situation personally.

16:19.972 --> 16:21.006
[R2-D2 beeps]

16:21.040 --> 16:23.675
All right, Pinky--
I mean, Qutee.

16:23.709 --> 16:25.443
This is your chance to shine.

16:25.478 --> 16:29.647
Use your magnet
to attract those swarm mines.

17:04.681 --> 17:10.252
There it is, the encryption module.

It's all up to you now, Artoo.

[R2-D2 beeps]

19:45.180 --> 19:48.048
Artoo says
we cannot leave Beezee behind.

Artoo's right.

We can repair him on the shuttle.

you stupid astromechs.

Funny thing about droids--

another droid.

a rousing success

and a brilliant plan
if I do say so myself.

21:14.139 --> 21:15.906
[R2-D2 chirps]

21:15.941 --> 21:18.509
I agree, Artoo.

Who knows, you droids

might just make decent soldiers
after all.
