He shoots and he--

01:18.161 --> 01:19.871
Oops! [giggles]

-Hey, Donny!
-Luca! Wow!

01:31.883 --> 01:34.177
You brought
your rescue helicopter?

01:34.552 --> 01:36.304
That thing is awesome.

01:37.514 --> 01:41.684
Hey, maybe we can
use the helicopter
to rescue Chilly!

01:41.768 --> 01:44.479
Wow.
That's a great idea.

01:44.562 --> 01:47.106
[laughs] Cool.
I'll do it!

01:50.193 --> 01:53.071
It was my idea.
I want to fly it.

01:53.154 --> 01:55.573
Yeah, but,
it's my helicopter.

01:55.657 --> 01:57.826
Let's fly it together.

02:00.328 --> 02:01.830
Yeah!
There it goes.

02:01.913 --> 02:04.165
[Luca]
Come on, Donny,
let me fly it.

02:04.249 --> 02:05.667
No,
turn it that way.

02:05.750 --> 02:08.002
Turn this way.
No!

02:08.086 --> 02:09.211
This way.

02:10.588 --> 02:12.340
Guys, Chilly's that way!

02:16.761 --> 02:19.264
[Luca] Aah!
She's going to crash!

02:19.931 --> 02:20.974
Oh, no!

02:24.435 --> 02:26.271
I got it.

02:27.313 --> 02:28.148
It's okay.

02:28.231 --> 02:30.984
Now, can one of you
fly it up to Chilly?

02:32.235 --> 02:33.945
[whirring]

02:34.696 --> 02:36.823
It's not working!

02:36.906 --> 02:38.283
What? No!

02:38.783 --> 02:42.412
Aw, and the rescue basket
fell off.

02:44.205 --> 02:45.039
Ow!

02:45.456 --> 02:46.875
Are you okay?

02:46.958 --> 02:49.127
My hand hurts.
Aw, man!

02:49.210 --> 02:51.921
First my helicopter
breaks, and now this?

02:52.005 --> 02:53.923
Come on,
let's go get my mom.

02:54.007 --> 02:55.425
She's a doctor.

02:55.508 --> 02:58.720
And I'll see if I can fix
your helicopter, okay?

02:58.928 --> 03:00.054
Okay.

03:08.354 --> 03:09.188
[giggling]

03:11.608 --> 03:13.401
[giggling] Huh?

03:13.860 --> 03:15.236
Oh!

03:15.320 --> 03:17.363
Hi, everyone!
Chilly, I'm--

03:17.447 --> 03:21.159
Ooh, Doc! Get me down!
I'm scared of heights!

03:21.242 --> 03:25.997
I know. I-- I just...
I can't reach you.

03:26.289 --> 03:29.042
Stand back, ma'am,
I'm Rescue Ronda.

03:29.125 --> 03:30.460
And if someone
needs rescuing,

03:30.543 --> 03:32.170
I'm the 'copter to do it!

03:32.253 --> 03:35.798
Great! Oh, wait!
There's something
I have to tell you!

03:36.090 --> 03:38.259
Roger that, Doc,
but it'll have to wait.

03:38.593 --> 03:41.346
Rescue Ronda
cleared for takeoff.

03:47.685 --> 03:50.271

to tell you.

03:52.482 --> 03:55.652
Your propellers
aren't working.

03:55.735 --> 03:57.612

My favorite thing
is helping toys.

04:03.952 --> 04:05.578
Then you do understand, Doc.

04:05.995 --> 04:09.082

a toy behind. Ever!

you're in good hands--

05:58.816 --> 06:00.735
I'm gonna look at you
out here.

you can zoom right up
and do a loopy-loop!

You did want
your doctor's bag,
didn't you?

Yes, but how
did you know that?

06:12.330 --> 06:13.498

is listen to your engine.

[engine beating]

Good.

06:45.571 --> 06:47.657
Okay, Ronda,
now I need to look

06:47.740 --> 06:50.743
at your main propellers,
see if I can spin them.

06:51.119 --> 06:52.954

06:53.037 --> 06:54.247

at these, so just relax.

07:11.431 --> 07:12.932
[grunts] Nope.

07:13.433 --> 07:15.101

07:17.728 --> 07:21.441
Hmm. Did anything weird
happen to you
today, Ronda?

07:21.524 --> 07:22.900
Can't say it did, Doc.

07:23.192 --> 07:25.403
'Course, I did crash
into that bush.

takes good care of me.

diagnose you.

You guys stay
with Ronda.

what Luca thinks.

How's Luca?

07:42.086 --> 07:44.672
He's got a splinter
in his finger!

07:44.755 --> 07:46.090

that splinter
and get it out,

07:52.513 --> 07:53.890
the sooner
you'll feel better!

07:53.973 --> 07:56.350
Doc, will you go get
a magnifying glass

07:56.434 --> 07:58.686
and some tweezers
out of my doctor's bag?

07:59.395 --> 08:00.813

There it is!

08:08.654 --> 08:09.822
Doc, hold this.

08:09.906 --> 08:12.700
Sure, Mom.
We doctors have
to help each other out.

08:13.117 --> 08:14.911
I'm going
to pull it out.

08:14.994 --> 08:16.245
No, don't touch it!

08:16.329 --> 08:17.705
It's gonna hurt!

08:17.788 --> 08:19.290

08:19.373 --> 08:22.126
I promise I'll have that
splinter out in no time.

08:22.210 --> 08:23.294
It's true.

08:23.377 --> 08:26.130
My mom's the best
splinter-puller I know.

08:26.214 --> 08:28.799

to hold still.
Right, Mom?

08:29.133 --> 08:30.301
That's right, Doc.

08:30.801 --> 08:32.428
Uh... okay.

08:32.720 --> 08:34.347
But I don't want to watch!

08:34.429 --> 08:35.264
I do!

And here we...

08:37.350 --> 08:39.434
go.
[chuckles] There!

08:39.519 --> 08:40.770
All done, Luca.

08:40.852 --> 08:43.438
You can look now.
Wow!

08:43.523 --> 08:46.734
That feels so much better.
Thanks, Dr. McStuffins.

08:47.401 --> 08:48.778
You're welcome, Luca.

08:49.445 --> 08:52.740
Now, just be careful
the next time
you reach into a bush.

08:53.115 --> 08:54.116
Hmm?

08:54.867 --> 08:57.578
You got the splinter
from the same bush

08:57.662 --> 09:00.748
that Rescue Ronda
was in. That's it!

09:01.207 --> 09:02.542

09:03.125 --> 09:05.753
Yee-haw!
Ride 'em, cowboy!

09:05.836 --> 09:07.588
Just try to spin me off!

09:07.922 --> 09:09.215
Okay!

09:12.176 --> 09:13.970
Whoa!
Aah!

09:15.304 --> 09:17.473
Well, you didn't have
to try that hard.

09:17.557 --> 09:19.392
Oh, look, Doc's back!

09:19.475 --> 09:21.852
Oh, yeah.
The Doc is in!

09:21.936 --> 09:24.105
And I know what's wrong
with Rescue Ronda!

09:24.605 --> 09:25.898
Hallie, I need my...

09:27.275 --> 09:29.527
magnifying glass.

09:29.902 --> 09:32.822
Let me guess.
Hippo hunch?

09:32.905 --> 09:34.657
Oh, yessiree!

09:34.740 --> 09:38.244
A hippo always knows, Doc.
A hippo always knows.

09:40.037 --> 09:41.414
Just what I thought.

09:41.497 --> 09:43.874
I have a diagnosis!

09:43.958 --> 09:46.586
Ronda, you have
stuckpropatosis!

like a splinter,

09:57.597 --> 09:58.806
stuck in your propellers.

09:58.889 --> 10:01.517
You must have gotten it
flying into the bushes.

10:01.601 --> 10:02.810
Can you fix it?

10:03.227 --> 10:04.228
I sure can!

10:05.187 --> 10:06.397
Oh, let see that.

10:07.398 --> 10:09.150
Hmm.

10:09.233 --> 10:11.068
Aah! Oh.

10:11.152 --> 10:12.737
[giggles] Hallie,

10:13.112 --> 10:15.906
maybe you should hold
the magnifying glass for me.

Okay, Ronda, I'm going
to get the splinter out.

10:21.621 --> 10:24.624
Oh, I'm not used to being
the one getting helped, Doc.

10:25.124 --> 10:28.544
Truth is,
I'm a little bit... scared.

10:29.003 --> 10:30.296
Just hold still.

10:30.588 --> 10:34.675
I promise, Doc is the best
splinter-puller I know!

10:35.301 --> 10:38.262
Okay, Doc,
I'm ready to hold still.

10:39.013 --> 10:40.890
I know you're trying
to fix me!

10:43.434 --> 10:46.937
Got it! Does that
feel better,
Rescue Ronda?

10:47.396 --> 10:49.398
[laughs] Affirmative!

Okay, Donny,
the treasure is hidden.

12:26.996 --> 12:31.625
Dragon Pirate Stuffy
and Princess Pirate Lambie
sailed the ocean.

12:32.084 --> 12:36.338
Suddenly they sailed
towards the edge
of the world.

Good thing Robot Ray
is here to save them!

aren't you supposed
to be cleaning your room?

I'll be right back.

Arrr, matey! That we will!

13:10.289 --> 13:13.042
Hey, Stuffy!
Don't rock the boat.

13:13.125 --> 13:15.252
I don't want
to get splashed!

13:15.753 --> 13:17.922
But I do love treasure.

13:18.130 --> 13:20.299
Stuffy and I
are going to find it!

13:20.633 --> 13:23.219
[laughs]
Not if I find it first!

13:23.719 --> 13:26.180
[groans]
But I want the treasure!

13:26.722 --> 13:29.266
Yes, but I am
a wicked king.
[chuckles]

13:29.350 --> 13:32.436
And wicked kings get
what wicked kings want.

13:33.062 --> 13:35.731
Hurry up, guys.
You'd better find
that treasure.

13:35.814 --> 13:37.858
Can I get
some help here?

13:39.693 --> 13:40.653
Stuffy!

13:40.736 --> 13:43.280
Help? Here? Now?
Oh! Yeah.

13:53.832 --> 13:56.126
I shall away, for now.

Sea monster
attacking the ship.

14:18.315 --> 14:19.650
Sea monster?

14:20.234 --> 14:21.652
That's Squeakers.

Never fear.
I will save you

in any danger.

I've got you,
Squeakers.

14:44.341 --> 14:46.510
Wow, Ray really chilled out.

14:47.094 --> 14:50.681
He's more than chilled out.
He's not moving.

14:51.056 --> 14:53.517
Oh, Doc, what happened
to Robot Ray?

14:53.601 --> 14:55.060
I'm not sure.

14:55.936 --> 14:58.439
But we'd better take him
to the clinic, stat!

14:58.522 --> 14:59.440
Come on!

14:59.523 --> 15:02.484
Treasure, you're just
gonna have to wait for us.

15:03.152 --> 15:04.320
The Doc is in,

15:04.403 --> 15:06.989
and we've got an emergency,
everyone! Hop to it!

15:11.410 --> 15:13.412
No lights, no sounds.

15:13.996 --> 15:15.956
Doc, is he gonna be okay?

15:16.373 --> 15:18.500
I haven't lost
a toy yet, Lambie!

15:20.961 --> 15:22.922
Let's open him up.

15:23.005 --> 15:26.967
[gasps] Oh.
That's a lot of water!

Oh. Good to have you back!

15:38.020 --> 15:40.230
What am I doing here?

15:40.648 --> 15:44.234
You went into the water,
then all your lights
and sounds went out.

15:44.652 --> 15:46.862
Everything working now?

15:49.073 --> 15:52.743
Sure is. And we're glad
you're okay, robot buddy!

a sea monster, it's Squeakers.

He's a friend.

16:16.600 --> 16:17.977

16:18.310 --> 16:20.771
Now we just need to do
a full checkup

16:21.230 --> 16:22.606

You have Wetmosis.

When Robot Ray got wet,

17:10.529 --> 17:12.781
it caused his whole system

And now that you're all dry,
the Wetmosis is all gone!

go in the water again.

needs to be rescued

Well, you just have to do it
without going into the water.

another way to do it.

<span style="style.default_1">Do what the doctor says ♪</span>

21:18.485 --> 21:19.486
Understood.

21:19.569 --> 21:21.655
Always follow
doctor's orders.

21:21.989 --> 21:23.824
Will do. Never fear.

21:23.907 --> 21:25.826
Great, now that
that's taken care of...

21:25.909 --> 21:29.371
Princess Pirate Lambie,
lead us to the treasure!

21:29.788 --> 21:31.665
[giggles] Come on!

21:34.251 --> 21:35.919
Aw, what happened
to the treasure?

21:36.003 --> 21:37.254
It's gone!

21:38.630 --> 21:40.632
What happened indeed!

21:41.049 --> 21:41.967
[all gasp]

21:42.301 --> 21:45.095
Oh, yes,
I found the treasure!

21:45.470 --> 21:47.097
[maniacal laughter]

21:47.389 --> 21:50.517
The Wicked King always
gets what he wants.

21:50.600 --> 21:53.061
Well, except arms.
I could use some arms,

21:53.145 --> 21:55.022
but besides that, I win!

21:55.105 --> 21:56.857
I found the treasure--
Whaa--

21:58.775 --> 22:00.569
Oh, drats!

22:00.652 --> 22:03.488
Oh. He dropped it!
Quick, to the ship!

22:04.072 --> 22:05.032
Where is it?

22:06.199 --> 22:07.451
[gasps]

22:08.201 --> 22:09.369
Aah! We're sinking!

22:09.453 --> 22:11.496
[screams] Help me!

22:11.580 --> 22:13.457
Don't worry,
I'll save you!

22:13.540 --> 22:16.960
Never fear. Robot Ray
will save the day!

22:17.044 --> 22:19.296
[both grunting]

22:21.506 --> 22:25.677
I must not go in the water.
Doctor's orders.

22:25.761 --> 22:28.555
I must save the day
another way.

22:28.638 --> 22:30.140
Uh, quickly, please!

22:37.773 --> 22:39.524
You have been saved.

22:39.608 --> 22:41.276
Nice moves!
[Lambie]
Thanks, Robot Ray!

22:42.027 --> 22:44.279
I see it. I see it!

22:44.362 --> 22:46.031
[laughs] Whoa!

22:47.199 --> 22:48.366
[babbles] I say!

22:48.784 --> 22:51.578
Doc, can the king
go in the water?

22:51.912 --> 22:53.997
[giggles] Yep,
he even floats!

22:59.795 --> 23:01.505
Treasure retrieved.

23:01.588 --> 23:03.548
All right!
Yes!

23:03.632 --> 23:05.300
Great job, Robot Ray!

23:05.717 --> 23:07.385
You followed
the doctor's orders,

23:07.469 --> 23:08.929
and you saved the day.

23:09.429 --> 23:11.681
Thank you
for your help, Doc.

23:12.015 --> 23:13.683
Now let's check out
the treasure.

23:14.518 --> 23:16.937
[all] Wow!
Ooh, pretty!

23:17.270 --> 23:19.523
[Donny]
Doc, I finished
cleaning my room!

23:19.606 --> 23:20.899
Toys! Go stuffed!

23:21.942 --> 23:25.237
Are you ready
for Robot Ray
to save the day?

23:25.737 --> 23:29.825
Donny, I'm always ready,
and so is Robot Ray!

23:32.953 --> 23:34.830
Hey, everybody,
it's Doc here.

<span style="style.default_1">Or play basketball?</span>

23:49.761 --> 23:51.429
Whoa... [grunts]

23:52.514 --> 23:54.558
<span style="style.default_1">That's right.</span>
