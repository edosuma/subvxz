00:03.195 --> 00:04.504
What do I have to do

00:04.529 --> 00:06.484
to get you to <i>consider</i> staying here?

00:06.875 --> 00:07.919
Uh, baby.

00:08.143 --> 00:09.719
I don't think she wants to stay.

00:10.371 --> 00:11.804
Curtis, stop it!

00:12.876 --> 00:14.476
Baby, can you <i> please</i>

00:14.501 --> 00:16.309
just get out of this conversation?

00:16.892 --> 00:17.984
I would love to,

00:17.986 --> 00:19.545
but the walls are so thin.

00:19.830 --> 00:20.996
It's termites.

00:21.390 --> 00:22.470
They're eating through 'em.

00:23.673 --> 00:24.939
You're not helping.

00:24.941 --> 00:26.792
Oh. Didn't know I was
supposed to be <i> helping.</i>

00:28.641 --> 00:30.309
- Curtis.
- What?

00:30.776 --> 00:32.375
Can you just stop acting like

00:32.378 --> 00:34.111
you don't want her to stay here?

00:34.113 --> 00:35.262
I'm not acting.

00:37.882 --> 00:39.051
She needs help.

00:39.051 --> 00:40.217
Can't you see that?

00:40.492 --> 00:41.530
Yes.

00:41.937 --> 00:43.718
Then why are you acting like that?

00:44.107 --> 00:46.078
'Cause I don't want to
be the one to help her.

00:47.077 --> 00:48.910
Go on! Get out of here!

00:48.912 --> 00:50.378
This is <i> my</i> house, Ella!

00:50.380 --> 00:51.879
- Uh-oh.
- Here we go.

00:51.881 --> 00:53.242
I live in it!

00:53.806 --> 00:55.450
I bought this with my blood,

00:55.452 --> 00:56.918
my sweat and my tears,

00:56.920 --> 00:58.168
and my muscles.

00:58.955 --> 01:00.421
Can I get an "amen," somebody?

01:00.423 --> 01:01.978
- No.
- This a church...

01:01.979 --> 01:03.912
No. I don't need you anyway.

01:03.914 --> 01:05.680
I own all of this!

01:06.850 --> 01:09.151
I <i> know</i> you don't want
to talk about this house.

01:09.959 --> 01:10.925
Why not?

01:10.927 --> 01:11.857
Okay.

01:12.106 --> 01:13.760
You're already in the dog house

01:13.763 --> 01:15.095
<i>because</i> of this house.

01:15.097 --> 01:16.664
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

01:16.666 --> 01:17.854
Is there a ladies' room?

01:18.070 --> 01:19.199
Oh, yeah. Right. Go down the street,

01:19.201 --> 01:20.834
the gas station around the corner.

01:20.836 --> 01:22.202
Go ahead and take the kids with you.

01:22.204 --> 01:24.371
Baby, it's right back there,

01:24.373 --> 01:25.811
first door on the right.

01:25.875 --> 01:26.876
Thank you.

01:27.576 --> 01:29.280
Oh, you mean that one?

01:30.112 --> 01:31.912
Hey! That window don't open.

01:33.182 --> 01:35.092
It's locked from the outside.

01:35.442 --> 01:37.017
Sealed with paint!

01:37.887 --> 01:39.804
Will you hush?

01:40.497 --> 01:42.529
- Will you?!
- Don't tell me to hush, Ella.

01:42.992 --> 01:44.792
What if she try to run off again?

01:45.661 --> 01:46.694
Hey, leave the door open!

01:46.696 --> 01:47.975
Will you stop it?

01:49.598 --> 01:50.831
Curtis.

01:50.833 --> 01:52.166
You know what this remind me of, don't you?

01:52.168 --> 01:53.166
What, Curtis?

01:53.191 --> 01:54.891
Come on. You know what it is.

01:54.916 --> 01:55.972
What, baby?

02:00.276 --> 02:01.675
Will you just stop it?

02:01.832 --> 02:03.285
We went through this with Janine.

02:03.310 --> 02:04.411
Who's Janine?

02:04.413 --> 02:06.023
The crackhead of the family.

02:06.482 --> 02:07.609
Okay.

02:07.783 --> 02:10.584
Janine had a very bad drug problem.

02:10.586 --> 02:12.121
- Oh.
- Yes.

02:12.722 --> 02:14.154
And she might, too.

02:14.156 --> 02:16.133
She does not have a drug problem.

02:16.359 --> 02:18.059
Then why is she with that crazy man?

02:18.194 --> 02:19.593
Curtis, I don't know.

02:19.595 --> 02:21.328
That's what we're gonna find out!

02:22.898 --> 02:24.336
You always do this.

02:25.101 --> 02:26.133
You always do this, Ella.

02:26.135 --> 02:28.116
You always get me into something!

02:29.197 --> 02:30.122
Ha!

02:30.147 --> 02:31.621
And I'm sick of it!

02:32.732 --> 02:34.632
Nah, man. You actually got her into this.

02:36.512 --> 02:37.811
'Cause I sold <i> you</i> the house.

02:37.813 --> 02:39.313
And you didn't even tell her.

02:39.315 --> 02:40.914
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

02:40.916 --> 02:42.235
I know you not talking about

02:42.260 --> 02:44.198
<i>me</i> getting <i> you</i> into nothing!

02:44.954 --> 02:46.311
One of these days..

02:47.523 --> 02:48.689
...me and you.

02:50.559 --> 02:51.859
One of these days.

02:52.561 --> 02:53.794
Oh, that's what I say.

02:54.419 --> 02:55.418
One of these days.

02:55.420 --> 02:57.492
- And it won't be long.
- One of these days.

02:57.517 --> 02:58.588
It won't be long.

03:01.278 --> 03:02.397
I'll get it.

03:02.680 --> 03:03.722
Hold on!

03:04.515 --> 03:05.647
You don't get the door

03:05.649 --> 03:07.276
unless I <i> tell</i> you to get the door!

03:08.786 --> 03:10.148
Well, go get the door!

03:12.289 --> 03:13.718
So dramatic.

03:15.226 --> 03:16.207
Thank you.

03:17.094 --> 03:18.201
Who is it?

03:18.596 --> 03:19.653
Some dude.

03:21.299 --> 03:22.515
It's Kendrick.

03:22.734 --> 03:23.865
It's Kendrick.

Who's that?

03:42.348 --> 03:43.744
I said his name was Kendrick.

03:44.550 --> 03:45.583
Well, who's that?

03:45.585 --> 03:47.651
Curtis, that is the so-called man

03:47.653 --> 03:49.153
who's been hitting Nyla.

03:49.155 --> 03:50.393
- Yeah.
- What?

03:51.548 --> 03:53.206
- Want to have a seat?
- No.

03:55.027 --> 03:56.311
Where's he going to sit?

03:56.395 --> 03:58.264
- Baby, calm down.
- Ha.

03:58.303 --> 03:59.495
Let me get this, okay?

03:59.803 --> 04:00.782
Curtis.

04:03.469 --> 04:04.816
Don't look her in the eyes.

04:05.741 --> 04:06.720
Okay.

04:07.444 --> 04:08.505
Can we help you?

04:08.507 --> 04:09.773
Yes, sir. I'm just
looking for my girl, Nyla.

04:09.775 --> 04:11.786
Oh, Nyla. Nyla just went over to...

04:14.247 --> 04:15.365
Nyla?

04:15.681 --> 04:17.661
- Anyone here named Nyla?
- Mm-mmm.

04:17.685 --> 04:19.363
Is there a Nyla in the building?

04:19.986 --> 04:21.084
I don't know her.

04:21.786 --> 04:23.786
There's nobody around here by that name.

04:24.056 --> 04:25.856
Ms. Joann, you know you know her.

04:25.858 --> 04:27.397
Y'all work together at the church.

04:27.483 --> 04:29.788
Oh, Nyla. I thought you said Myra.

04:30.152 --> 04:31.623
Nope, Nyla.

04:32.053 --> 04:32.985
Is she here?

04:32.987 --> 04:33.922
Well...

04:33.922 --> 04:36.456
Curtis, can you please handle this?

04:36.457 --> 04:37.723
Ella, let me do it.

04:37.725 --> 04:39.691
Will you let me do it, please, baby?

04:39.693 --> 04:41.560
- Well, you're taking your time.
- Can I do...

04:41.562 --> 04:43.909
This is my cool approach, Ella.

04:44.198 --> 04:47.099
I'm not playing with you, Curtis.

04:48.135 --> 04:50.354
Excuse me. Where is she?

04:50.805 --> 04:52.626
What do you want with her?

04:53.051 --> 04:55.240
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to come in here like that.

04:55.242 --> 04:57.472
She called me, told me
to come to this address.

04:57.539 --> 04:59.363
I'm supposed to pick her up, take her home.

04:59.793 --> 05:00.894
Where's home?

05:01.328 --> 05:02.327
My house.

05:02.496 --> 05:04.452
That's not an address.

05:06.466 --> 05:08.158
345 Biscayne.

05:08.468 --> 05:09.434
That's a nice area.

05:09.436 --> 05:10.635
Yes, sir. Yeah you know it.

05:10.637 --> 05:11.670
Yeah, I know it.

05:11.672 --> 05:13.038
I used to know this girl lived over there,

05:13.040 --> 05:14.306
apartment 19.

05:14.308 --> 05:15.495
You know Melinda?

05:15.776 --> 05:17.442
Delinda! Yeah, that's
who I'm talking about.

05:17.444 --> 05:19.511
How you know Delinda? Oh, that's my sister.

05:19.513 --> 05:21.514
I don't know who you talkin' 'bout, at all.

05:22.376 --> 05:23.741
- Ryan.
- Yes, ma'am.

05:24.051 --> 05:25.283
If you're going to talk to him,

05:25.285 --> 05:26.759
take it out on the porch.

05:26.954 --> 05:28.517
You want to go play outside?

05:31.992 --> 05:33.170
We can do that, too.

05:33.170 --> 05:34.133
Curtis.

05:34.435 --> 05:36.121
Ella, I got this.

05:37.408 --> 05:39.275
Can I get this, please?

05:44.608 --> 05:46.041
God! Women, man!

05:46.066 --> 05:47.624
- Women, man!
- Right?

05:47.649 --> 05:49.300
Right. You tell him.

05:49.325 --> 05:50.441
No, you tell him.

05:51.488 --> 05:52.890
Something else.

05:52.890 --> 05:54.281
Ah, something else!

05:54.438 --> 05:55.540
Yep.

05:56.937 --> 05:58.170
No matter how hard I try,

05:58.173 --> 05:59.406
I just can't understand them.

05:59.408 --> 06:00.407
Hey, I hear you.

06:02.399 --> 06:04.163
- Not at all.
- Not at <i> all.</i>

06:05.058 --> 06:06.899
That's why you got to keep them in line.

06:07.247 --> 06:08.548
Got to keep them in line!

06:09.985 --> 06:11.010
Shut up.

06:13.693 --> 06:14.759
You do?

06:14.761 --> 06:16.827
Yeah. Don't you keep yours in line?

06:16.829 --> 06:18.071
Heh.

06:18.096 --> 06:19.029
Heh.

06:19.299 --> 06:20.279
No.

06:23.136 --> 06:25.569
But, I mean, what do you mean by that?

06:27.340 --> 06:29.302
What I mean is, you have to think for them.

06:30.178 --> 06:32.156
You know what I mean? You
have to make sure that,

06:32.312 --> 06:33.511
when you tell them something to do,

06:33.513 --> 06:34.478
that they do it,

06:34.480 --> 06:36.411
or else there's consequences.

06:36.950 --> 06:37.950
Oh!

06:38.309 --> 06:39.283
Wow.

06:39.285 --> 06:40.217
Yeah.

06:40.219 --> 06:41.731
- Is that right?
- That's right.

06:43.189 --> 06:44.146
Hmm.

06:44.557 --> 06:45.727
How do you do that?

06:46.292 --> 06:48.327
Well, I mean, Nyla and I, we...

06:48.695 --> 06:50.287
Just say that we have a understanding.

06:51.331 --> 06:52.409
What's that?

06:53.162 --> 06:54.364
It's none of your business,

06:54.389 --> 06:56.089
but she does what I tell her.

06:57.470 --> 06:58.936
Oh. Oh, okay.

07:01.975 --> 07:03.114
Hey, you know what?

07:03.476 --> 07:04.452
What?

07:04.744 --> 07:06.837
You sound dumb as hell.

07:08.481 --> 07:09.643
Excuse me?

07:10.278 --> 07:12.045
I-I'm just saying, you know,

07:12.046 --> 07:13.545
this whole vibe you got,

07:13.547 --> 07:15.848
it's like, you know, it's like something

07:15.850 --> 07:18.216
straight out the '70s or something.

07:19.720 --> 07:21.386
It's like you sound so ignorant.

07:21.388 --> 07:22.378
You're, like...

07:22.522 --> 07:23.862
Ignoramus.

07:25.392 --> 07:26.791
- I don't get it.
- I'm sorry, man.

07:26.793 --> 07:28.226
I don't... what?

07:28.228 --> 07:29.928
You heard me, cat daddy.

07:32.478 --> 07:33.850
That was out the '70s.

07:35.168 --> 07:37.135
Okay, look here, man.
I'm gonna go get my girl,

07:37.137 --> 07:38.746
and I'm leaving. All right?

07:40.941 --> 07:43.274
I don't think she's going to go with you.

07:43.276 --> 07:45.058
- Oh! Oh, no?
- No.

07:45.083 --> 07:46.149
Hey, we'll see about that.

07:46.151 --> 07:47.817
Hey, hold... hold on. Hold on, cat.

07:49.254 --> 07:50.220
Where you going, partner?

07:50.222 --> 07:51.354
I'm going to get my woman.

07:54.308 --> 07:56.174
You's not going in <i> my</i> house.

07:56.176 --> 07:57.517
Man, look here.

07:57.945 --> 07:59.479
You got one thing right.

08:00.047 --> 08:01.500
I am a man.

08:02.783 --> 08:04.516
And I'm a man that's not going to let you

08:04.518 --> 08:05.865
go in his house.

08:06.448 --> 08:07.480
You don't seem like

08:07.505 --> 08:09.254
you're used to dealing with a man.

08:13.547 --> 08:15.884
You looking at me like you
want to put me in my place,

08:17.164 --> 08:18.853
and I'd love to see you try it.

08:19.766 --> 08:21.599
Oh, dude. I ain't got a problem with you.

08:22.336 --> 08:24.135
<i>Yeah,</i> but see...

08:25.388 --> 08:27.136
...you hit on ladies,

08:27.590 --> 08:29.070
so I have a problem with you.

08:29.492 --> 08:30.424
Are you serious?

08:30.574 --> 08:32.244
I'm serious as pallbearers.

08:32.409 --> 08:33.619
You got any in mind?

08:34.770 --> 08:36.054
I see how this is.

08:36.813 --> 08:38.105
Yeah, I'm glad.

08:39.482 --> 08:40.443
Nah.

08:40.918 --> 08:42.296
You want her for yourself.

08:42.991 --> 08:44.667
- Man, get out of...
- No, no, no, no!

08:44.699 --> 08:46.600
No, I see how it is. You
want her for yourself, right?

08:46.602 --> 08:47.804
You see this sexy little thing.

08:48.749 --> 08:50.039
You think you can handle her?

08:50.064 --> 08:52.638
You're too broke to be her sugar daddy.

08:52.891 --> 08:54.206
I want you off my property.

08:54.209 --> 08:55.742
I want to get in there, get my girl.

08:58.282 --> 09:00.263
Wow! This is going viral!

09:04.975 --> 09:06.541
I can't believe you just did that!

09:06.542 --> 09:07.574
Wow, uncle C!

09:07.576 --> 09:08.809
There's this kid in the 10th grade,

09:08.811 --> 09:09.877
his name body count.

09:09.879 --> 09:11.445
He been taking my vanilla-cream cookies

09:11.447 --> 09:12.479
for the past month.

09:12.481 --> 09:14.214
Teach me that! Please, teach me that.

09:14.216 --> 09:15.983
I'm going to give him one of those.

09:15.985 --> 09:17.084
I always wanted to say this.

09:17.086 --> 09:19.364
Man, you got knocked the...

09:19.364 --> 09:20.422
Hey!

09:21.655 --> 09:22.565
Too much?

09:22.567 --> 09:23.876
- Too much.
- Okay.

09:27.564 --> 09:28.678
Is he alive?

09:31.482 --> 09:32.514
Get out the way.

09:38.558 --> 09:39.649
Man!

09:41.094 --> 09:42.052
Just go.

09:49.028 --> 09:50.261
You can't let her go back with him.

09:50.286 --> 09:51.223
Hmm.

09:51.248 --> 09:53.458
No, seriously. She can't go back there.

09:53.483 --> 09:54.849
You're gonna let her stay, right?

10:01.092 --> 10:03.125
Can you believe he just
gonna pop up over my house?

10:03.150 --> 10:04.220
Unh-unh.

10:05.127 --> 10:06.228
Hey, baby.

10:06.548 --> 10:07.917
Can I talk to you in the kitchen?

10:08.616 --> 10:10.881
Uh, Curtis, not right now, baby.

10:11.419 --> 10:12.611
Was that Kendrick?

10:13.387 --> 10:15.121
Yeah, he was here. He's gone now.

10:15.790 --> 10:17.576
- Where did he go?
- To the E.R.

10:17.825 --> 10:18.847
Home.

10:20.228 --> 10:22.094
Well, I better get going. He'll be mad.

10:22.096 --> 10:23.776
Nyla, wait, wait.

10:24.031 --> 10:25.564
- Let me talk to you.
- Why?

10:25.566 --> 10:26.899
Nyla, just let me talk to you.

10:26.901 --> 10:29.705
Joann, Ryan, can you all give us a moment?

10:30.004 --> 10:31.103
Mnh-mnh.

10:31.310 --> 10:32.882
- Joann.
- Huh?

10:33.852 --> 10:36.185
<i>Please</i> let me
talk to her in private.

10:36.187 --> 10:37.171
Mmh.

10:37.985 --> 10:39.150
Okay.

10:40.208 --> 10:41.231
Mmh.

10:42.291 --> 10:43.325
Mmh.

10:44.537 --> 10:47.246
Uh, hello?! Ryan!

10:54.457 --> 10:55.589
It's okay.

10:55.591 --> 10:57.339
One moment. I got one more.

10:59.128 --> 11:00.243
Curtis.

11:05.201 --> 11:06.140
Thank you.

11:08.204 --> 11:10.503
- It's okay, really.
- Just one... One moment.

11:11.907 --> 11:13.320
I know my husband.

11:16.379 --> 11:17.815
Please, Curtis.

11:25.588 --> 11:27.655
- Nyla, look at me.
- Yeah.

11:27.657 --> 11:29.556
Look at my in my eyes.

11:30.826 --> 11:31.872
Yes.

11:32.061 --> 11:33.433
What is wrong with you?

11:33.696 --> 11:34.730
What do you mean?

11:34.755 --> 11:36.630
You are worth more than this.

11:36.632 --> 11:37.998
Ms. Ella, I appreciate this, but I have...

11:38.000 --> 11:40.129
No, no, no. Listen. Just hear me.

11:40.970 --> 11:42.870
When someone hits you like that,

11:42.872 --> 11:44.538
they do not respect you,

11:44.540 --> 11:45.572
and they do not care for you.

11:45.574 --> 11:47.013
No, you're wrong.

11:47.346 --> 11:49.880
Hmm, well, how do you
think I'm wrong about that?

11:50.090 --> 11:51.490
- He loves me.
- Nyla.

11:51.492 --> 11:52.521
He does.

11:52.546 --> 11:53.959
Nyla, that's not love!

11:53.961 --> 11:56.161
Look, no one has a perfect life, right.

11:56.163 --> 11:57.496
No. No one does.

11:57.498 --> 11:59.598
Okay, well, mine is not perfect, either.

11:59.600 --> 12:00.732
Okay. Well, wait a minute.

12:00.734 --> 12:02.540
Hear me when I say this...

12:03.037 --> 12:05.904
There is a difference
in not having a good life

12:05.906 --> 12:06.938
and having one where

12:06.940 --> 12:09.479
you're putting yourself in harm's way.

12:09.743 --> 12:11.643
- You don't understand.
- Yes, I do.

12:11.645 --> 12:13.512
I understand that you
are setting an example

12:13.514 --> 12:14.743
for these children.

12:14.743 --> 12:16.174
- You are.
- They're young.

12:16.352 --> 12:17.651
- They're young...
- Yeah.

12:17.653 --> 12:18.951
...and they are watching.

12:20.356 --> 12:21.889
Ms. Ella, I gotta get going.

12:21.891 --> 12:23.290
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

12:23.292 --> 12:25.501
Wait. I have seen this before.

12:25.588 --> 12:26.764
I've seen it.

12:26.764 --> 12:28.434
I have seen kids

12:28.434 --> 12:30.765
that parents think are
not paying attention,

12:31.336 --> 12:32.395
and they are,

12:32.838 --> 12:34.869
and their lives are ruined.

12:35.273 --> 12:36.918
No. My kids are fine.

12:36.918 --> 12:39.587
Oh. Have you asked them if they're fine?

12:39.612 --> 12:41.045
Yes, all the time.

12:41.047 --> 12:42.865
Okay. And what do they say?

12:43.016 --> 12:44.697
They tell me they're fine.

12:44.851 --> 12:46.918
Well, do you mind if I ask them...

12:46.920 --> 12:47.919
That's not gonna be necessary.

12:47.921 --> 12:49.020
Oh, it's not gonna be necessary.

12:49.022 --> 12:50.550
Let's just see. Please.

12:50.575 --> 12:51.522
- Okay.
- Okay.

12:51.524 --> 12:52.517
- I'm telling you...
- Fine is fine.

12:52.542 --> 12:53.504
...they're fine.

12:53.504 --> 12:55.432
Uh, Lynn, Kenny!

12:55.967 --> 12:57.902
Can you come in here for a moment, please?

12:58.503 --> 13:00.303
Have a seat by your mother.

13:03.408 --> 13:04.432
What?

13:05.777 --> 13:08.153
You say "Yes, Ma'am" when I call you, okay?

13:08.385 --> 13:10.246
- Yeah, okay.
- Hey, hey, hey.

13:10.248 --> 13:12.357
Show some respect. You know better.

13:12.517 --> 13:14.772
Ha! You need to hit him upside the head.

13:14.797 --> 13:15.851
That'll get him straight.

13:15.898 --> 13:17.150
Lynn, don't say that.

13:17.150 --> 13:19.019
What? It'll make him shut up.

13:19.419 --> 13:21.368
Ah! This girl.

13:21.587 --> 13:23.711
Why do you say it will make him shut up?

13:23.956 --> 13:25.248
'Cause when Kendrick hits you,

13:25.273 --> 13:26.223
you just get all quiet,

13:26.225 --> 13:27.592
so hit him.

13:28.394 --> 13:29.872
Kendrick doesn't hit me.

13:29.897 --> 13:30.902
Yes, he does.

13:32.413 --> 13:33.561
How do you know that?

13:34.098 --> 13:35.049
We know.

13:35.902 --> 13:37.168
Have you seen it?

13:37.170 --> 13:38.276
No, we hear it.

13:39.503 --> 13:41.471
Wait. Wait.

13:42.114 --> 13:43.881
Look, can we just go home?

13:44.917 --> 13:46.342
Do you want to go back to Kendrick's?

13:46.367 --> 13:47.317
- Yeah.
- Okay.

13:47.319 --> 13:49.460
Wait, wait, wait. Why do
you want to go back there?

13:49.755 --> 13:51.683
'Cause we got <i>food</i> to eat.

13:51.910 --> 13:53.910
- Sometimes!
- Better than nothing.

13:54.180 --> 13:55.539
Well, I like it here.

13:56.743 --> 13:58.286
We are not staying here.

13:58.498 --> 13:59.464
Yes, we are.

13:59.466 --> 14:01.065
So if we gotta put up with him,

14:01.067 --> 14:03.401
at least we get to be in a nice house.

14:05.570 --> 14:06.819
Is that what you think, Kenny?

14:07.330 --> 14:08.322
Yeah.

14:09.894 --> 14:11.033
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

14:11.058 --> 14:11.994
Okay.

14:12.316 --> 14:13.440
Okay, you kids go back

14:13.499 --> 14:14.735
and let me talk to your mom.

14:15.118 --> 14:17.024
Wait, didn't you just call us in here?

14:17.721 --> 14:19.836
Yes, and now I'm asking you to leave.

14:20.180 --> 14:21.256
Make up your mind.

14:21.258 --> 14:22.657
Ah, ha ha ha!

14:22.659 --> 14:24.510
I'm gonna help you make up your mind,

14:24.761 --> 14:26.461
to show you how to talk to adults.

14:26.463 --> 14:28.022
- Keep it up.
- Yes, Ma'am.

14:33.971 --> 14:35.257
You see what I mean.

14:35.806 --> 14:37.582
No, I don't.

14:37.875 --> 14:39.577
Nyla, you're intelligent.

14:39.977 --> 14:41.059
You see it.

14:41.276 --> 14:42.675
Ms. Ella, you don't know.

14:42.678 --> 14:45.246
Okay, well, then tell me what I don't know.

14:47.701 --> 14:49.889
I was out on the streets, okay?

14:50.745 --> 14:52.478
My mama kicked me out of the house.

14:54.068 --> 14:55.137
We had nothing.

14:55.470 --> 14:57.264
We were sleeping in an old van,

14:57.264 --> 15:01.210
and I was doing what I
had to do to feed them.

15:01.373 --> 15:02.374
Mm-hmm.

15:03.003 --> 15:05.443
Now I found someone that is
not that bad all the time,

15:05.468 --> 15:06.772
and he is <i> not.</i>

15:06.774 --> 15:10.501
Nyla, hitting you upside
your head when he gets upset

15:10.934 --> 15:12.444
is bad all the time.

15:12.686 --> 15:15.683
He should <i> never</i>
put his hands on you.

15:16.141 --> 15:19.265
All I have to do is just do what he asks.

15:21.713 --> 15:23.263
I can't force you to stay here.

15:24.015 --> 15:25.058
I can't.

15:25.851 --> 15:28.406
But I can ask you to consider this...

15:29.688 --> 15:31.754
You almost hurt him real bad.

15:31.756 --> 15:33.270
You thought you were going to prison.

15:37.128 --> 15:39.229
Maybe my kids are better off without me.

15:39.931 --> 15:41.865
Children need their moms.

15:42.968 --> 15:44.568
My kids deserve better.

15:44.970 --> 15:47.370
Stop it. Just stop it.

15:47.372 --> 15:48.692
I can't do that.

15:48.840 --> 15:50.710
I'm <i> not</i> doing the pity party.

15:50.809 --> 15:52.709
I'm sorry. I can't.

15:52.711 --> 15:56.117
I'm not doing the "feel
sorry for me" thing.

15:57.433 --> 15:58.821
You have a choice.

15:59.335 --> 16:01.979
You have someone standing here before you,

16:02.217 --> 16:04.190
offering you a way out,

16:05.273 --> 16:06.508
and you won't take it.

16:07.308 --> 16:09.663
That has <i> nothing</i> to do with them.

16:10.478 --> 16:12.990
If your kids deserve better,

16:13.881 --> 16:15.787
then why don't you give them better?

16:18.886 --> 16:20.448
Why are you being so nice to me?

16:21.656 --> 16:24.990
Because I'm a balance-keeper.

16:25.893 --> 16:27.117
What does that mean?

16:27.762 --> 16:29.595
Nyla, there are people in this world

16:29.597 --> 16:31.605
who only want to do harm to people

16:32.135 --> 16:33.832
or only want to give

16:33.834 --> 16:35.568
because of what they can get.

16:36.837 --> 16:39.922
But then there are people
like me and my hus... Band...

16:40.474 --> 16:42.033
Well, people like me,

16:43.077 --> 16:46.879
who... who only want to give to others,

16:46.881 --> 16:48.214
to try to keep balance

16:48.214 --> 16:51.682
in this dark, dark, dark,
dark, dark, dark world.

16:52.279 --> 16:53.445
That's a lot to give.

16:53.447 --> 16:56.298
Yeah, but I'm not the one
with the problem giving,

16:57.538 --> 17:00.148
but you're the one with
the problem receiving.

17:00.908 --> 17:02.459
Take this gift.

17:03.544 --> 17:04.651
Take it!

17:08.315 --> 17:10.082
You promise that this is okay?

17:10.084 --> 17:11.439
Yes, this is okay.

17:11.997 --> 17:13.050
Are you sure?

17:13.053 --> 17:16.194
I am <i> sure</i> this is okay.

17:17.057 --> 17:18.208
What about him?

17:20.920 --> 17:22.853
Has he been standing there the whole time?

17:22.877 --> 17:23.810
Yep.

17:28.102 --> 17:29.351
Curtis.

17:31.605 --> 17:33.004
Baby, have you been standing up there

17:33.006 --> 17:34.379
the whole time?

17:35.008 --> 17:36.575
I've been keeping the balance.

17:37.911 --> 17:38.944
Okay, baby.

17:38.946 --> 17:40.816
Would you tell her that it is okay

17:41.315 --> 17:42.994
for she and her kids to stay here?

17:43.140 --> 17:44.211
Huh?

17:45.252 --> 17:46.418
Can you tell her it is okay

17:46.420 --> 17:47.619
for them to stay here?

17:47.621 --> 17:48.988
Don't play with me right now.

17:50.365 --> 17:51.568
Sure, okay. That's fine.

17:52.440 --> 17:53.547
Are you sure?

17:53.927 --> 17:54.996
Sure about what?

17:55.963 --> 17:58.617
Are you sure you want me
and my kids to stay here?

17:58.844 --> 17:59.810
Mm.

17:59.835 --> 18:00.828
Oh.

18:01.568 --> 18:03.532
Uh, y'all want to stay here?

18:04.071 --> 18:05.553
Curtis, you heard her.

18:05.906 --> 18:08.073
Ella, you know I've been
struggling with this ear.

18:12.179 --> 18:13.832
Sure, okay. It's fine.

18:16.206 --> 18:17.343
And my kids?

18:18.280 --> 18:19.241
Ki...

18:21.150 --> 18:22.214
Curtis.

18:22.779 --> 18:24.161
You asking a lot.

18:29.062 --> 18:30.395
This is what I mean, baby.

18:30.397 --> 18:31.884
I'm the balance-keeper.

18:33.333 --> 18:34.750
I have to balance him.

18:35.924 --> 18:39.181
Tell her it is okay if
they <i> stay here,</i>

18:39.840 --> 18:40.772
please.

18:40.774 --> 18:41.715
Huh?

18:43.722 --> 18:46.142
It's okay for you and your kid to stay.

18:46.580 --> 18:47.779
I have more than one.

18:48.782 --> 18:50.259
The boy can't stay, Ella.

18:50.784 --> 18:51.716
