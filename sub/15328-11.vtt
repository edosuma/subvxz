- Dad, you know who asked me
out on a date

00:04.421 --> 00:06.256
to his family's country club?

00:06.339 --> 00:08.758
Flip McAllister III.

00:08.842 --> 00:11.302
As in McAllister Mall,
McAllister Bank,

00:11.386 --> 00:14.431
McAllister cured meats.

00:14.514 --> 00:16.140
- Is this all a lead up
to you asking me

00:16.224 --> 00:17.642
for an expensive new dress?

00:17.726 --> 00:21.271
- No, just something simple
that goes with a convertible.

00:21.354 --> 00:22.772
A red one.

00:22.856 --> 00:25.275
- Charlie, say bye-bye
to James,

00:25.358 --> 00:27.986
because he's about
to go bye-bye.

00:28.069 --> 00:29.612
- James, what did you do?

00:29.696 --> 00:31.114
- Nothing.

00:31.197 --> 00:34.784
- He sent out a memo telling
teachers not to come until noon.

00:34.868 --> 00:38.288
- Nothing...and that.

00:38.371 --> 00:40.623
- He got a week of detention.

00:40.707 --> 00:42.542
- How could you do
something like that?

00:42.625 --> 00:43.793
- Easy.

00:43.877 --> 00:44.377
I stole some letterhead
from the office

00:44.461 --> 00:45.628
when they were at lunch.

00:45.712 --> 00:47.797
- Stole? James?

00:47.881 --> 00:49.007
Why am I saying that like

00:49.090 --> 00:51.259
the two things
don't go together?

00:51.342 --> 00:54.220
- Chill out, I totally
understand your concern.

00:54.304 --> 00:55.680
I can't get caught.

00:55.764 --> 00:58.808
That's the takeaway here.

00:58.892 --> 01:02.312
- No, the takeaway
is you need to stop scamming.

01:02.395 --> 01:03.646
You're not a little kid anymore.

01:03.730 --> 01:04.647
And one of these days,

treating you like one.

02:07.252 --> 02:08.086
{\an8}That's impressive.

02:08.169 --> 02:10.088
{\an8}- Yeah, it's no big deal.

02:10.170 --> 02:11.381
{\an8}Except it's a huge deal.

02:11.464 --> 02:13.716
{\an8}I'm gonna make so much money.

02:13.800 --> 02:17.053
{\an8}- You always were
my favorite cousin.

02:17.137 --> 02:18.096
{\an8}- How long you staying?

02:18.179 --> 02:19.514
{\an8}- Just a couple of days.

02:19.597 --> 02:21.057
{\an8}Speaking of which, do you know
of a good hotel nearby?

02:21.140 --> 02:22.809

I know of 15.

02:22.892 --> 02:23.893

02:23.977 --> 02:27.063
{\an8}I went through a divorce,

{\an8}- Come on, don't be silly.

02:28.314 --> 02:29.315
{\an8}Our couch is your couch.

02:29.399 --> 02:33.736
{\an8}- Uh, at a hotel,
you can get a bed and a couch.

02:33.820 --> 02:37.240
{\an8}And, uh, if you're up
early enough, a danish.

02:37.323 --> 02:39.242
{\an8}- Jamal, you'll stay with us.

02:39.325 --> 02:40.243

That is so generous.

some more time with my cous.

Uh, Stephanie, can I see you
in the kitchen for a moment?

02:47.333 --> 02:48.918
We need to figure out dinner.

02:49.002 --> 02:50.253

02:50.336 --> 02:51.504
We'll take him out.

02:51.588 --> 02:53.131
- Uh, well, then let's go
pick out a restaurant.

02:53.214 --> 02:55.091
- Oh, I thought
we'd go to Vino's.

02:55.174 --> 02:58.011
- Then let's go
pick out an appetizer.

03:00.471 --> 03:01.639
Stephanie, we've got to get
Jamal out of here

03:01.723 --> 03:03.683
the sooner the better.

03:03.766 --> 03:04.976
- What are you talking about?

03:05.059 --> 03:05.894
This is perfect.

03:05.977 --> 03:06.936
Just when we were
worried about James,

03:07.020 --> 03:09.772
this great role model walks in.

03:09.856 --> 03:11.608
- Jamal can't be a role model
for James.

03:11.691 --> 03:14.611
Jamal was James.

03:14.694 --> 03:17.322
The last time he stayed here,
he left with my golf clubs.

03:17.405 --> 03:18.489
- He stole them?

03:18.573 --> 03:20.283
No, I gave them to him.

03:20.366 --> 03:21.284
I have no idea why.

03:21.367 --> 03:23.786
He's that good.

03:23.870 --> 03:24.621
- You haven't seen him in years,
Charlie.

03:24.704 --> 03:27.332
Maybe he's legit.

03:27.415 --> 03:29.292
Besides,
he's your ex-wife's family.

is Kim thinking

03:30.877 --> 03:32.545
I'm trying to drive away
her people.

03:32.629 --> 03:33.129

03:33.212 --> 03:35.173
I'm not afraid of her.

the guys wear jackets and ties.

03:48.561 --> 03:50.813
[laughs] And they also serve
steak and lobster.

03:50.897 --> 03:52.482

they serve kibble,

'cause you've got the manners
of a dog.

03:55.818 --> 03:56.694

03:56.778 --> 04:00.657

04:00.740 --> 04:04.035
Now, sit your derriere
at this table.

04:04.118 --> 04:05.411
You're trying to impress
this country club crowd,

you have got to learn
proper table etiquette.

Show me how to use this fork.

04:17.048 --> 04:17.589

you're doing wrong?

04:17.673 --> 04:20.009
- No.

04:20.093 --> 04:24.389
- It is a fork, not a shovel.

04:24.472 --> 04:29.352
You are to take a dainty bite,
then place it back on your plate

04:29.435 --> 04:31.270
until you've finished chewing.

04:31.354 --> 04:33.481

gonna take your pie.

04:45.952 --> 04:50.873
Why are you choking that cup
as if it stole your man?

04:50.957 --> 04:51.874

04:51.958 --> 04:56.045
Were you raised in a barn?

04:56.129 --> 04:57.380
- Aaron's right.

04:57.463 --> 04:58.798
Pinky out.

04:58.881 --> 05:00.133
- How do you know
how to do that?

05:00.216 --> 05:03.386
- From this video game
"Mind Your Manners Massacre."

05:03.469 --> 05:05.430
- "Mind Your Manners Massacre"?

05:05.513 --> 05:06.889

And if you don't hold your
pinky out, this psycho teacher

05:08.641 --> 05:11.477
Mrs. Fingerbow says,
"I beg your pardon."

05:11.561 --> 05:14.063
And then cuts your hand off.

05:14.147 --> 05:15.273
- That's aggressive.

05:15.356 --> 05:16.566
- But effective.

It's how I learned

squeezes juice from your head.

can squeeze a lemon.

- Wrong.

05:27.660 --> 05:29.412
- Aaron, tell her how to do it.

you gently press the sides.
