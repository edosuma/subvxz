00:00.700 --> 00:02.739
Duncan Allen!
I'm Holly Evans from the Herald.

00:02.740 --> 00:04.275
I don't forget a name.
I know who you are.

00:04.300 --> 00:05.980
This isn't usual journalistic practice,

00:05.981 --> 00:08.019
doorstepping the editor of another paper.

00:08.020 --> 00:10.818
Entertainment.
Without it, we won't sell papers.

00:10.820 --> 00:12.139
Have you seen James?

00:12.140 --> 00:15.979
I am one of only three investigative
reporters left at my paper.

00:15.980 --> 00:18.539
You think you're a prize-winning,
crusading, liberal paper

00:18.540 --> 00:20.139
exposing hypocrisy and corruption.

00:20.140 --> 00:22.979
I want journalism. You want money
to get the best? You got it.

00:22.980 --> 00:25.459
Sales are down. Carry on like this,
we won't survive.

00:25.460 --> 00:27.019
We need to take some risks.

00:27.020 --> 00:28.899
- Who are you?
- Ed Washburn.

00:28.900 --> 00:30.659
First death knock and you got in?

00:30.660 --> 00:32.499
You should feel bad about
what you did today.

00:32.500 --> 00:35.560
- You don't seem OK.
- Leave.

00:36.620 --> 00:40.139
This programme contains
some strong language

00:40.140 --> 00:42.140
I don't like ice cream.

00:43.380 --> 00:44.860
Especially vanilla.

00:46.620 --> 00:49.579
I ask you to tell me something

00:49.580 --> 00:53.379
about anything, about yourself,
and that's what you come up with?

00:53.380 --> 00:54.674
Your turn.

00:54.699 --> 00:57.219
I want something about
your family, your parents,

00:57.220 --> 01:02.459
how you ended up sleeping with men
for huge amounts of money.

01:02.460 --> 01:04.379
I don't sleep with men...

01:05.019 --> 01:06.539
I sleep with you.

01:06.540 --> 01:10.059
OK. Well, thanks for the ice cream
information.

01:10.060 --> 01:11.583
Next time we're at the
seaside, I'll be sure to...

01:11.608 --> 01:13.339
Your turn.

01:13.340 --> 01:15.660
I was... I was born in South Africa,

01:17.155 --> 01:20.019
but we moved back to Reading
when I was seven.

01:20.020 --> 01:23.859
When I was 13, my parents died
in a rock-climbing accident.

01:23.860 --> 01:26.539
No other family, so I went into a home.

01:26.540 --> 01:30.379
Then moved to Edinburgh,
joined a band, had a hit single.

01:30.380 --> 01:32.860
- Really?
- Yeah. Er... Love Is Up.

01:33.260 --> 01:35.539
- You heard of it?
- No.

01:35.540 --> 01:37.939
And then I, um...
You haven't heard of it?

01:37.940 --> 01:39.579
It was... it was good!

01:39.580 --> 01:41.579
I mean, it was big in Europe.

01:41.580 --> 01:43.379
I-I don't like pop music.

01:43.380 --> 01:45.299
Oh. Fair enough.

01:45.300 --> 01:49.659
So then I became a model
for a few months,

01:49.660 --> 01:52.859
then a binman, postman,

01:52.860 --> 01:56.220
but eventually, I realised
I had a talent for news,

01:56.820 --> 01:59.299
so I slept my way into the industry

01:59.300 --> 02:04.260
and within ten years,
I was editor of a Sunday paper.

02:04.740 --> 02:06.140
No parents.

02:06.540 --> 02:08.139
So you had to fight.

02:10.620 --> 02:13.060
I won't see you for a couple of days.

02:13.660 --> 02:15.620
Going back to your wife and son?

02:18.740 --> 02:20.619
I never told you I had a wife and son.

02:20.620 --> 02:23.620
You were drunk,
and sometimes you are sad.

02:25.460 --> 02:27.259
It's good you are going home.

02:27.260 --> 02:28.980
MESSAGE ALERT

02:37.480 --> 02:39.480
_

02:42.180 --> 02:44.579
By the way, all that, my life story,

02:44.580 --> 02:47.419
the band, binman.

02:47.420 --> 02:48.899
I made it up.

02:48.900 --> 02:50.779
You tell me nothing,
I'll tell you nothing.

02:50.780 --> 02:52.419
But you're in newspapers.

02:52.420 --> 02:54.739
You should be all about information.

02:54.740 --> 02:58.179
Information? Information's nothing.

02:58.180 --> 02:59.940
I'm all about the story.

After conference, the Sure Staff
Foundation from Tower Hamlets

03:48.740 --> 03:49.933
are coming to say thank you

03:49.958 --> 03:51.859
- for your support at 12:00.
- Right.

03:51.860 --> 03:53.820
And then you've got Justin from Marketing

03:53.845 --> 03:55.779
coming in to talk to you about the cover.

03:55.780 --> 03:57.831
I know you're going to
say you want to move it,

03:57.856 --> 03:59.539
but you've moved it four times already,

03:59.540 --> 04:02.579
so you can move it again,
but you won't be popular.

04:02.580 --> 04:06.299
Do you want me to move it again,
or shall I find out what it's about?

04:06.300 --> 04:10.100
No, I know exactly what it's about.
Why do you think I keep moving it?

04:39.180 --> 04:42.180
Yeah, Mum, met some good people.
Having a great time.

04:43.180 --> 04:46.100
No, I'm good. Not partying, head down.

04:48.420 --> 04:49.885
Work experience.

04:50.660 --> 04:52.424
I'm working for a publishing house.

04:52.425 --> 04:55.299
We do mainly novels, poetry,
that sort of thing.

04:55.300 --> 04:57.659
Yeah, exactly what I wanted to do.

04:57.660 --> 04:59.580
Not paid much, but I'm doing OK.

05:03.260 --> 05:05.374
I need to head off now. Sorry.

05:05.375 --> 05:08.420
Yeah, love you. Bye.

05:10.340 --> 05:12.580
If I worked at The Post, I'd lie too.

05:22.540 --> 05:23.940
Morning.

05:24.733 --> 05:25.973
What?

05:28.060 --> 05:30.179
The cake's decorated
like a summer's afternoon.

05:30.180 --> 05:32.490
It brightened up my day, thought
it might do the same for you.

05:32.491 --> 05:35.939
And this is a caffeinated
flat white, just as you like it.

05:35.940 --> 05:37.459
Already got one, thanks.

05:37.460 --> 05:38.899
You can't have too much caffeine.

05:38.900 --> 05:40.740
If you have too much caffeine, you die.

05:41.780 --> 05:43.219
What's all this?

05:43.220 --> 05:45.139
I want the best lead from
today's conference.

05:45.140 --> 05:46.579
I was talking to Peter yesterday.

05:46.580 --> 05:49.259
I want to be a credit to the
entire organisation, like you were.

05:49.260 --> 05:51.059
You really are blowing smoke up my arse.

05:51.060 --> 05:52.579
Yeah, I know.

05:52.580 --> 05:54.779
Peter said you were pushy, too,
when you were my age.

05:54.780 --> 05:56.259
When I was your age?

05:56.260 --> 05:59.259
I mean... at this point in your career.

05:59.260 --> 06:01.299
But I'm only a few years older than you

06:01.300 --> 06:03.460
Eight years older. I'm 27.

06:04.260 --> 06:06.479
- Oh.
- That's why I'm keen.

06:06.480 --> 06:07.842
Expressing enthusiasm.

06:07.843 --> 06:10.459
Yeah, well,
you can stop now cos it's annoying.

06:14.260 --> 06:15.939

06:17.380 --> 06:19.100
- 'Course. You brought me cake.
- APPLAUSE

06:22.620 --> 06:24.420
Bye, love. Bye.

06:25.980 --> 06:28.734
- It's sad.
- Yeah. Amina told her yesterday.

06:28.735 --> 06:32.340
- How long was she here?
- 20 years. It won't be the last.

06:33.100 --> 06:34.460
Could be us next.

06:35.980 --> 06:37.420
Conference!

06:38.620 --> 06:40.540
HUBBUB

06:52.547 --> 06:54.427
You're in his chair, mate.

07:01.700 --> 07:03.060
You're fired.

07:03.559 --> 07:04.879
Clear your stuff out.

07:05.500 --> 07:07.699
Go. Frank Powell, what have we got?

07:07.700 --> 07:10.939
Steel union boss
demanding special intervention.

07:10.940 --> 07:13.259
He wants bailout cash, renationalisation.

07:13.260 --> 07:14.859
Compensation, as well.

07:14.860 --> 07:18.619
So he wants my money to pay for
a factory that isn't working?

07:18.620 --> 07:20.179
Look at him. Who is he?

07:20.180 --> 07:23.019
- Frank Powell.
- Yeah, but who is he?

07:23.020 --> 07:24.380
Frank Powell?

07:24.860 --> 07:26.099
Are you...?

07:26.100 --> 07:29.459
I mean, find out things about
his life, come back and tell me.

07:29.460 --> 07:30.820
Oh, right, sure.

07:32.340 --> 07:35.379
And there have been a series of
protests outside Parliament

07:35.380 --> 07:37.568
on the proposed reform
of disability benefit.

07:37.593 --> 07:38.600
Good for them.

07:38.601 --> 07:40.419
Government seem to think
they can get away with it

07:40.420 --> 07:43.139
because historically, disabled
people have a low voting turnout

07:43.140 --> 07:45.579
due to mobility and access issues.
It should be prominent.

07:45.580 --> 07:46.739
Should be.

07:46.740 --> 07:50.099
But I put that on the front page,
do you know how many we sell?

07:50.100 --> 07:54.459
Here. I put the steel plant
on the cover, we sell that much.

07:54.460 --> 07:57.699
I put that polar bear on the cover,
just show me that polar bear again.

07:57.700 --> 07:59.219
I know, I know, I know.

07:59.220 --> 08:02.379
Go for that bear and we sell that many.

08:02.380 --> 08:04.499
But do you know what will outsell
anything?

08:04.500 --> 08:06.459
Well, surely it's not all to do with
sales?

08:06.460 --> 08:08.420
Right now, it is.

08:09.220 --> 08:11.260
Um... he would do.

08:12.260 --> 08:13.579
Or her.

08:13.580 --> 08:15.979
Young celebrities, we are all obsessed.

08:15.980 --> 08:18.579
You get one of those to comment
on disability benefits,

08:18.580 --> 08:20.980
you're in with a chance, but,
er... good luck with that.

08:21.260 --> 08:22.539
I have to pick my battles.

08:22.540 --> 08:24.339
Yep, you should pick this one.

08:24.340 --> 08:25.859
What's next?

08:25.860 --> 08:29.539
Sergei Bagrov, son of Ivan Bagrov,
the oligarch.

08:29.540 --> 08:31.499
He stands to inherit a lot of money.

08:31.500 --> 08:32.698
Why do I care?

08:32.700 --> 08:34.499
He's opening a restaurant and he's having

08:34.500 --> 08:37.299
a Halloween costume party at his
townhouse afterwards in Chelsea.

08:37.299 --> 08:40.339
He's mates with everyone.
The whole younger generation.

08:40.340 --> 08:42.339
This is THE party.

08:42.340 --> 08:45.364
- Angie's got an invite.
- Yeah. Me and Caro could go?

08:45.365 --> 08:47.730
We might see something
we're not supposed to.

08:47.731 --> 08:50.300
Yeah, not this time. What's your name?

08:51.620 --> 08:53.939
Oh, er... E-E-Ed.

08:53.940 --> 08:57.779
You're unfired. Dress as an ant
and go this party with Angie.

08:57.780 --> 08:59.420
- An ant?
- Next.

08:59.940 --> 09:01.779
This is a sad polar bear.

09:01.780 --> 09:03.653
Part of a shopping centre in China.

09:03.654 --> 09:05.459
There's a growing movement to release it.

09:05.460 --> 09:07.099
See, that is gold.

09:07.100 --> 09:09.619
Have you seen that? It's a campaign.

09:09.620 --> 09:11.219
We're going to save that bear.

09:11.220 --> 09:12.859
We'll give it a name,

09:12.860 --> 09:15.779
we'll find a zoo that will take it. Ben?

09:15.780 --> 09:18.859
- Ed.
- Forget the ant, go as a polar bear.

09:18.860 --> 09:21.939
Right, the man of steel, what's his name?

09:21.940 --> 09:23.220
Clark Kent.

09:23.561 --> 09:25.321
The steel man.

09:25.346 --> 09:27.426
Oh, Frank Powell. Frank Powell.

09:28.340 --> 09:32.179
I want everything. Family,
what he likes, where he goes.

09:32.180 --> 09:35.659
He wants a bailout? I'd bet
his whole life is a bailout.

09:35.660 --> 09:37.299
Look at him, he looks like a drinker.

09:37.300 --> 09:40.230
Find out what pub he goes to. Dirt, OK?

09:40.256 --> 09:41.420
All right, we're done.

10:02.687 --> 10:04.419

- I'm sorry?

10:04.420 --> 10:06.020
Just then, she said something.

10:07.233 --> 10:08.793
Sorry, I didn't hear.

10:16.300 --> 10:17.779
Hi!

10:17.780 --> 10:18.939
Hello.

10:18.940 --> 10:20.339
How was that?

10:20.340 --> 10:22.220
Actually, I have got something for you.

10:23.296 --> 10:25.899
Really? Oh, thanks! Seriously?

10:25.900 --> 10:30.180
Eve Godwin. Two children, three
grandchildren, married 40 years,

10:30.483 --> 10:32.322
likes boating holidays.

10:32.323 --> 10:35.242
In March, she went into
St Margaret's Hospital in Leicester

10:35.243 --> 10:36.723
because she hurt her leg.

10:37.140 --> 10:38.322
What did they do?

10:38.323 --> 10:40.922
- With her leg? They fixed it.
- Oh. OK, good. So, why...?

10:40.923 --> 10:41.960
A day later, she died.

10:41.985 --> 10:43.794
An infection that she picked
up when she was in there.

10:43.795 --> 10:44.815
How do you know...?

10:44.840 --> 10:47.322
Because my hobby is staying
up late looking at statistics

10:47.323 --> 10:49.122
and converting them into human stories.

10:49.123 --> 10:52.442
The mortality rates at St Margaret's
are higher in the last year

10:52.443 --> 10:55.322
than any other hospital,
across all departments.

10:55.323 --> 10:56.682
I want to know why.

10:56.683 --> 10:59.162
Well, surely they've noticed.

10:59.163 --> 11:01.642
They said that it's an anomaly.

11:01.643 --> 11:03.002
Are we buying that?

11:03.003 --> 11:04.962
- No?
- No.

11:04.963 --> 11:08.323
So I've ordered a bulk load of paperwork

11:09.225 --> 11:10.922
under Freedom of Information.

11:10.923 --> 11:12.860
Copies in these boxes.

11:15.833 --> 11:17.988
Do you have anything more specific?

11:18.013 --> 11:19.882
I don't. So go through this

11:19.883 --> 11:22.682
and then head to the hospital
first, probably.

11:22.683 --> 11:25.802
But it might be nothing.
And either way, I'm on my own.

11:25.803 --> 11:28.882
Well, that's the challenge, isn't
it, in these cash-strapped times?

11:28.883 --> 11:30.563
You said you wanted this.

11:30.815 --> 11:32.255
Yeah.

11:33.749 --> 11:35.180
OK.

11:44.193 --> 11:47.312
Two daughters, one of which has
depression and money problems.

11:47.313 --> 11:49.552
- Good.
- The other is a school teacher.

11:49.553 --> 11:51.512
He's worked at a factory his whole life.

11:51.513 --> 11:53.472
Although no-one admits
an alcohol problem,

11:53.473 --> 11:55.792
he's apparently seen down the pub
quite often.

11:55.793 --> 11:57.032
- Mm.
- Two grandchildren.

11:57.033 --> 11:59.872
Leave them out.
He's probably a racist or something.

11:59.873 --> 12:01.592
Check his Twitter. Is he on Twitter?

12:01.593 --> 12:03.725
- Yeah.
- Good. I bet you 20 quid

12:03.750 --> 12:05.432
he's said something offensive.

12:05.433 --> 12:06.952
Oh, yes!

12:06.953 --> 12:08.473
LAUGHTER

12:10.673 --> 12:12.033
Is it hot in there?

12:13.153 --> 12:16.112
It looks it. It's a bit of a
climate change for you, isn't it?

12:16.113 --> 12:17.935
Can you...? He doesn't look sad.

12:17.960 --> 12:19.152
- Does he look sad, Raz?
- No.

12:19.153 --> 12:21.472
Er... can you look sad?

12:21.473 --> 12:22.793
Can you do that?

12:24.113 --> 12:26.672
- LAUGHTER
- Yes! Yeah.

12:26.673 --> 12:30.072
Do that at the party tonight
with a celebrity, right?

12:30.073 --> 12:32.792
Get me something good,
or you're fired, right?

12:32.793 --> 12:35.193
- Are you pleased you're a journalist?
- LAUGHTER

12:36.513 --> 12:38.273
It's like a mime!

12:39.353 --> 12:40.953
Where are you tonight?

12:42.513 --> 12:44.072
- Home.
- Home?

12:44.073 --> 12:45.272
Yeah. What?

12:45.273 --> 12:47.790
No, that's... that's good.

12:48.329 --> 12:49.858
Thanks.

12:53.353 --> 12:56.845
It's a big thing, and big companies
are crying out for the opportunity

12:56.846 --> 12:58.392
to associate their brand with ours.

12:58.393 --> 12:59.872
Lydale?

12:59.873 --> 13:02.968
Just an example, but they are a company

13:02.969 --> 13:04.952
that's expressed an interest
in this kind of marketing.

13:04.953 --> 13:06.392
You can't see the paper.

13:06.393 --> 13:09.152
It's proven to not impact sales,
massively.

13:09.153 --> 13:11.393
Have a think and we'll talk tomorrow?

13:11.606 --> 13:13.126
Sure. Thanks.

13:16.359 --> 13:18.719
- How old are you?
- 33.

13:19.513 --> 13:22.592
- You look 25.
- I don't drink. Never have.

13:22.593 --> 13:26.673
So my skin hasn't suffered,
like... other people.

13:28.993 --> 13:31.112
The trust exists
so we don't have to do this.

13:31.113 --> 13:32.552
The trust is running out of money.

13:32.553 --> 13:34.552
The board said to explore
new income streams.

13:34.553 --> 13:36.032
- They can work on the designs.
- No, no.

13:36.033 --> 13:37.992
It doesn't look like you're buying
a newspaper,

13:37.993 --> 13:39.912
it looks like you're buying
an advertisement.

13:39.913 --> 13:41.832
Do you remember VHS?

13:41.833 --> 13:43.672
- Was that a shop?
- No!

13:43.673 --> 13:46.100
V-H-S? Video cassettes?

13:48.713 --> 13:51.352
No. In the '80s, that's how
you'd watch a film at home,

13:51.353 --> 13:54.232
but they went through this period of
putting trailers for other films

13:54.233 --> 13:55.992
at the begining of the one
you'd just paid money for.

13:55.993 --> 13:57.632
So you had to fast-forward them,

13:57.633 --> 13:59.272
and they went out of date really quickly

13:59.273 --> 14:01.185
and you were stuck with adverts

14:01.210 --> 14:02.432
before you could get to
the thing you bought.

14:02.433 --> 14:04.632
You have no idea what I'm talking about.

14:04.633 --> 14:07.593
No. But I'm listening
because I respect you.

14:08.140 --> 14:12.272
The... the point is, I paid money
precisely so I didn't have adverts,

14:12.273 --> 14:14.192
but they were trying to do both.

14:14.193 --> 14:15.992
It's the same with this.

14:15.993 --> 14:17.712
Our paper isn't cheap,

14:17.713 --> 14:20.752
so, then, to have it encased
in an advert, as well...

14:20.753 --> 14:21.997
Our readers understand.

14:21.998 --> 14:25.809
No. I worry that if we do this,
we lose respect.

14:25.810 --> 14:27.222
Independence.

14:27.223 --> 14:28.632
People buy the Herald for the truth.

14:28.633 --> 14:31.472
How can they trust us if we're wrapped
up in a profit-making company?

14:31.473 --> 14:34.472
Everybody's doing them.
It's how the world is these days.

14:34.473 --> 14:35.952
It feels wrong!

14:35.953 --> 14:37.313
New things often do.

14:42.233 --> 14:44.112
- For me?!
- All the way from India.

14:44.113 --> 14:45.433
Oh, wow!

14:45.780 --> 14:47.432
The price tag says "Heathrow".

14:47.433 --> 14:48.952
Oh! Sorry.

14:48.953 --> 14:51.232
I ran out of time before I got
to the airport.

14:51.233 --> 14:54.241
You know, you like gin.
It's the thought that counts.

14:54.242 --> 14:56.192
- There you go.
- Very kind of you.

14:56.193 --> 14:58.472
- Have you read my piece?
- I have. It's good.

14:58.473 --> 15:00.192
Has Amina seen it?

15:00.193 --> 15:01.872
She wants to talk to you about it.

15:01.873 --> 15:03.552
It's a really good piece, James.

15:03.553 --> 15:04.993
James!

15:05.380 --> 15:06.832
What'd you get her?

15:06.833 --> 15:08.552
Shit! Sorry!

15:08.553 --> 15:10.679
- Hey!
- Is that for me?

15:10.680 --> 15:13.580
- Mm. All the way from India.
- Oh, thanks!

15:14.193 --> 15:15.320
She's a genius.

15:15.345 --> 15:18.032
I said, if you want to cover the
disability bill, get a celebrity.

15:18.033 --> 15:20.673
You know who she got? Rosie Fisher.

15:21.502 --> 15:22.556
Really?

15:22.581 --> 15:24.718
Well, I remembered that her
auntie had cerebral palsy.

15:24.719 --> 15:26.872
Didn't have to brief her.
She couldn't wait to say her bit.

15:26.873 --> 15:28.813
Yeah. So I get sales and we get the story

15:28.814 --> 15:31.067
on the front page, where we want it.
It's a good day.

15:31.068 --> 15:32.512
Have you read my piece?

15:32.513 --> 15:35.153
Ah. I did, yeah. Come in, let's talk.

15:38.193 --> 15:39.540
Whoa!

15:40.273 --> 15:41.633
Oh.

15:45.633 --> 15:47.872
- We can't use it, mate.
- What? Why!

15:47.873 --> 15:49.152
It's important!

15:49.153 --> 15:51.872
Three major clothing companies
outsourcing their manufacturing

15:51.873 --> 15:54.872
to local companies that use child labour.

15:54.873 --> 15:56.592
Relly, Teeks, Lydale.

15:56.593 --> 15:58.353
The sources are children.

15:58.700 --> 16:00.512
- So?
- How did you interview them?

16:00.513 --> 16:03.152
- With a translator.
- Just the three of you in the room?

16:03.153 --> 16:04.320
Yeah. What...?

16:04.345 --> 16:05.992
That places a lot of
trust in the translator.

16:05.993 --> 16:07.992
Amina, look, you've read it.

16:07.993 --> 16:09.873
Were there responsible adults there?

16:10.380 --> 16:13.142
- I'm a relatively responsible adult.
- A parent? A guardian?

16:13.143 --> 16:15.192
These children,
they don't have people like that!

16:15.193 --> 16:17.912
What if the companies turn around
and say they're making it up?

16:17.913 --> 16:20.592
They want an apology
unless we have proof?

16:20.593 --> 16:23.352
I'd understand, but there are
six different children here

16:23.353 --> 16:24.880
who work in different factories.

16:24.905 --> 16:26.300
- Now, that's a pattern...
- No!

16:29.553 --> 16:30.872
Well, can't we at least print

16:30.873 --> 16:33.792
that there's questions raised
about their practices, or...?

16:33.793 --> 16:35.900
Is that the piece you want to write?

16:41.045 --> 16:43.325
You know, you would have run this.

16:43.906 --> 16:45.786
A year ago, I think you were braver.

16:46.580 --> 16:48.392
What, that's what you think?!

16:48.393 --> 16:50.232
Everyone does.

16:50.233 --> 16:52.993
We're losing money
and you've got nervous.

16:55.460 --> 16:56.752
We'll find something else.

16:56.753 --> 16:59.113
You'll get there. Come on,
let's get out of here, mate.

17:04.193 --> 17:05.673
DOOR CLOSES

17:14.338 --> 17:15.747
That's it now, you can go.

17:15.771 --> 17:17.647
I might just stay and
get ahead for tomorrow.

17:17.673 --> 17:19.780
- You don't have to.
- It's all right.

17:20.353 --> 17:22.433
Everything OK at home?

17:24.673 --> 17:26.712
What? Yeah, yeah, yeah,
everything's great.

17:26.713 --> 17:27.953
OK.

17:29.138 --> 17:31.418
- Night, then.
- Night.

17:33.553 --> 17:35.296
KNOCK AT DOOR

17:35.297 --> 17:37.752
You should always have a bottle of
gin on your desk.

17:37.753 --> 17:40.872
It could become your thing,
you know? Your eccentricity.

17:40.873 --> 17:43.580
Every leader needs their quirks.
I read it in a book.

17:46.620 --> 17:47.993
He didn't mean it.

17:48.340 --> 17:49.913
No, sure.

17:50.380 --> 17:53.432
James knows we're right.
He's been hard at work ever since.

17:53.433 --> 17:54.552
Yeah.

17:55.118 --> 17:56.598
Yeah.

17:57.673 --> 18:00.312
OK. Well, goodnight, then.

18:00.313 --> 18:02.073
Yeah. Thanks.

18:04.139 --> 18:05.779
See you tomorrow.

19:12.553 --> 19:14.073
- Hey.
- Hi.

19:21.073 --> 19:22.392
Dinner?

19:22.393 --> 19:25.580
Er... yeah. Thanks.

19:32.193 --> 19:34.593
MUSIC: You Spin Me Round
(Like A Record) by Dead Or Alive

19:35.753 --> 19:37.313
ANIMATED CHATTER

19:38.833 --> 19:40.352
WHOOPING

19:40.353 --> 19:41.833
WHISTLING

19:42.913 --> 19:44.273
Huh!

19:45.953 --> 19:50.060
Here, let me take a picture.
#Bearbear's at the party!

19:53.193 --> 19:55.433
Wh... What?

19:57.513 --> 19:59.193
I was at Oxford with them.

20:00.553 --> 20:03.152
That lot. They'll know who I am,

20:03.153 --> 20:05.032
that I wouldn't be somewhere like this.

20:05.033 --> 20:06.552
You went to Oxford?

20:06.553 --> 20:07.912
Yeah.

20:07.913 --> 20:09.392
SHE LAUGHS

20:09.393 --> 20:12.472
Wow! Look at you now!

20:12.473 --> 20:14.832
SHE LAUGHS Here you go.

20:14.833 --> 20:16.913
- Ah!
- SHE LAUGHS

20:21.113 --> 20:23.060
Better keep your head on, then.

20:25.033 --> 20:26.513
What? No, don't go...!

20:34.260 --> 20:36.232
So, what are you leading on?

20:36.233 --> 20:37.953
Oh, really?

20:38.460 --> 20:39.912
You want to know?

20:39.913 --> 20:41.100
I'm your wife.

20:41.940 --> 20:43.460
I'm interested.

20:43.953 --> 20:47.312
Well, unprecedented, but, um... sure,
why not?

20:47.313 --> 20:50.472
It's the leader of the steelworkers'
union, Frank Powell.

20:50.473 --> 20:52.792
He's making demands on the government,

20:52.793 --> 20:56.319
threatening strike action
and getting other unions involved.

20:56.320 --> 20:57.432
Right.

20:57.433 --> 21:01.189
But we feel that he hasn't got
the right to demand tax money

21:01.190 --> 21:03.032
to prop up his failing industry.

21:03.033 --> 21:04.392
So, what's the front page?

21:04.393 --> 21:05.873
We tear him apart.

21:06.319 --> 21:07.559
Who he is...

21:09.353 --> 21:11.033
...the contradictions in his life.

21:13.980 --> 21:15.152
Why?

21:15.153 --> 21:18.712
You don't have to be that clever
to work out that the plant closing

21:18.713 --> 21:21.152
has very little to do with
this government.

21:21.153 --> 21:22.672
There's another reason.

21:22.673 --> 21:25.182
- What?
- Why you're attacking him.

21:25.183 --> 21:27.580
I know there is, but you're
not going to tell me, so...

21:28.612 --> 21:30.020
...fine.

21:30.759 --> 21:34.079
Does he have family? Children?

21:34.820 --> 21:36.672
And grandchildren.

21:36.673 --> 21:38.112
What will they think?

21:38.113 --> 21:42.660
I assume they don't need a paper
to tell them what he's like.

21:47.593 --> 21:49.073
I want to save this marriage.

21:52.713 --> 21:54.020
Sorry?

21:57.913 --> 21:59.833
Are you sleeping with other women

22:00.620 --> 22:02.540
in London when you stay over?

22:04.799 --> 22:06.279
Don't lie.

22:08.852 --> 22:10.612
I'm assuming you are.

22:11.545 --> 22:13.800
I'm assuming you've been
sleeping with other people

22:13.825 --> 22:15.169
for at least a year now.

22:20.113 --> 22:21.553
If you've made that assumption...

22:22.963 --> 22:26.020
...then why would you put up with it?

22:27.713 --> 22:31.753
Because, as I said,
I want to save this marriage.

22:37.473 --> 22:38.780
One woman.

22:45.132 --> 22:46.612
I pay her.

22:52.313 --> 22:54.273
You don't need to pay for sex.

22:58.553 --> 22:59.793
No.

23:02.393 --> 23:05.712
You do it because you don't want
to feel any responsibility to her.

23:05.713 --> 23:08.500
You don't want to have to think
about her as a person.

23:11.193 --> 23:13.393
Means you can focus on your work.

23:15.993 --> 23:17.100
Yeah.

23:17.593 --> 23:21.272
I want us to keep trying,
for the sake of Fred.

23:21.273 --> 23:23.744
That's why you've got dinner,
why I'm still up,

23:23.745 --> 23:26.072
why I'm wearing some ridiculous
underwear.

23:26.073 --> 23:27.472
You're wearing...?

23:27.473 --> 23:30.313
Well, it doesn't feel very
practical, put it like that.

23:33.033 --> 23:35.940
It's about what's important to you.

23:37.233 --> 23:39.472
I can't make you a different person,

23:39.473 --> 23:42.712
but I need to be able to look
my son in the eye and tell him

23:42.713 --> 23:45.993
I did everything I could to keep
his mum and dad together.

23:50.193 --> 23:51.873
MUSIC POUNDS

24:11.073 --> 24:12.672
I'm a witch's cat.

24:12.673 --> 24:14.798
Yeah, I can see that.

24:14.799 --> 24:16.592
People think I'm a badger.

24:16.593 --> 24:18.392
I don't usually come to these things,

24:18.393 --> 24:20.112
but my mate got an invite,

24:20.113 --> 24:23.872
so I thought, I work six days
a week, relentless,

24:23.873 --> 24:25.264
rare day off tomorrow,

24:25.289 --> 24:26.672
- so, why not?
- Right.

24:26.673 --> 24:28.312
Are you here with some people?

24:28.313 --> 24:30.873
Er... my friend, but I think
she's gone somewhere.

24:31.420 --> 24:32.952
Mine, too.

24:32.953 --> 24:36.272
Oh. Um... I'm Ed, by the way.

24:36.273 --> 24:37.912
- Belle.
- Nice to meet you.

24:37.913 --> 24:39.712
- You, too, Ed.
- I really like the, er...

24:39.713 --> 24:41.153
Excuse me.

24:45.793 --> 24:47.552
Tell me you know who she is.

24:47.553 --> 24:49.312
Her name's Belle.

24:49.313 --> 24:51.553
Don't any of your friends have kids?

24:52.060 --> 24:53.192
I'm 25.

24:53.193 --> 24:57.488
She's Belle Hicks, THE most popular
presenter on children's television.

24:57.489 --> 24:59.767
Belle's Place. Miss-Take.

24:59.768 --> 25:01.272
Happy Belle Time?!

25:01.273 --> 25:03.392
Ah! OK.

25:03.393 --> 25:05.832
Talk to her. Get her talking.
You getting on?

25:05.833 --> 25:08.752
Er... yeah, until you pulled me away.

25:08.753 --> 25:13.552
Well, make sure you record it, yeah?
Make sure it's switched on.

25:13.553 --> 25:15.473
- Yeah.
- Go.

25:17.313 --> 25:21.503
- I got those dr-i-i-inks.
- Ah, thank you.

25:21.504 --> 25:22.833
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

25:24.033 --> 25:25.352
So what do you do?

25:25.353 --> 25:27.192
I present Children's TV.

25:27.193 --> 25:28.792
Wow, must be hard work.

25:28.793 --> 25:32.632
Yeah, it's long hours, it's a huge
amount of TV you're presenting.

25:32.633 --> 25:36.152
I mean, I'm paid really well but
compared to the presenters

25:36.153 --> 25:38.072
on the main channels, you know.

25:38.073 --> 25:41.552
I'm not complaining, I love what I
do, there's this whole generation

25:41.553 --> 25:43.873
of children that I'm making
a difference to.

25:46.353 --> 25:49.752
- What do you do?
- Um, um, I'm in publishing.

25:49.753 --> 25:51.912
- Ah!
- Yeah, novels, books. That sort of thing.

25:51.913 --> 25:55.552
- Your parents must be proud.
- Er, yeah.

25:55.553 --> 25:57.072
Are yours?

25:57.073 --> 25:59.072
Yeah! My mum's a head teacher,

25:59.073 --> 26:02.072
of a primary school,
so all the kids watch me.

26:02.073 --> 26:05.685
- She likes that.
- So, what about stuff you don't like?

26:05.686 --> 26:07.800
- What?
- Is there anyone at work

26:07.825 --> 26:08.952
you're not really into?

26:08.953 --> 26:11.122
Oh, don't get me started!

26:11.123 --> 26:13.752
I'm never allowed to talk
about this stuff.

26:13.753 --> 26:16.163
- Got to be so well behaved.
- Really?

26:16.188 --> 26:17.200
- Mm.
- Well, just chill out,

26:17.201 --> 26:19.312
- you can be relaxed, babe.
- Yeah, that makes a change.

26:19.313 --> 26:21.912
You'd think since it's for kids,
everyone would be positive

26:21.913 --> 26:24.512
and happy, but it's the opposite of
that. There's no money,

26:24.513 --> 26:26.713
it's stressy. Especially Davey.
You know Davey?

26:27.873 --> 26:29.273
Woo!

Oh, um, dead end.

27:14.516 --> 27:16.792
I've checked through a lot of the
records, called everyone

27:16.793 --> 27:18.753
- I could find but it's...
- You're at the hospital?

27:19.833 --> 27:22.513
- What?
- You at Leicester, at the hospital?

27:22.740 --> 27:25.832
Er, yeah,
I've been in but no-one's talking.

27:25.833 --> 27:27.140
They're all too busy.

27:27.913 --> 27:30.592
- Where are you now?
- I told you, the hospital.

27:30.593 --> 27:33.473
- Where exactly?
- Parked outside?

27:34.513 --> 27:38.266
- In your car?
- Er, yeah. Look, without going through

27:38.267 --> 27:39.632
all the documents, which would take...

27:39.633 --> 27:41.752
- Honk your horn.
- What?

27:41.753 --> 27:43.792
Honk the horn of your car,
if you're in a car.

27:43.793 --> 27:45.713
Honk the horn so I can hear it.

27:48.033 --> 27:49.270
Leona?

27:49.295 --> 27:51.542
Actually, I've just stepped out to, um...

27:51.543 --> 27:53.192
OK, I'm willing to bet that there
isn't a single person

27:53.193 --> 27:56.512
at St Margaret's who remembered a
journalist asking questions today.

27:56.513 --> 27:58.592
Have you spoken to anyone?

27:58.593 --> 28:00.192
I've left messages with...

28:00.193 --> 28:01.912
Have you been through all the records?

28:01.913 --> 28:04.632
Well, no, of course not, you saw
how many there were but...

28:04.633 --> 28:09.006
Look, I know your way of doing
things is actually to go there,

28:09.007 --> 28:10.952
and talk to the people, whatever,
but honestly it's quicker

28:10.953 --> 28:14.575
these days to get information by
e-mail, social media, even Twitter,

28:14.576 --> 28:15.965

32:01.048 --> 32:02.672
- I'll get it going.
- Thanks.

32:02.673 --> 32:03.913
Early start?

32:08.473 --> 32:10.552
Been away, just got back.

32:10.553 --> 32:12.312
Why are you so wet?

32:12.313 --> 32:15.072
- I don't have an umbrella.
- Why not?

32:15.073 --> 32:17.113
I left in a hurry, forgot.

32:18.993 --> 32:22.272
I went over that piece I wrote
about you, by the way.

32:22.273 --> 32:26.232
It was all from sources. Every word
I used, misogynist, bully.

32:26.233 --> 32:29.832
I wasn't just making it up, it was
all from people you've worked with.

32:29.833 --> 32:32.072
I never said it wasn't true.

32:32.073 --> 32:33.432
I am a bully.

32:33.433 --> 32:36.073
I do hate a lot of women.

32:36.460 --> 32:37.912
Right.

32:37.913 --> 32:40.913
I hate a lot of men as well, though.
You missed that out.

32:42.313 --> 32:44.952
I also found some articles you wrote
when you were a reporter.

32:44.953 --> 32:46.393
They were good.

32:46.740 --> 32:48.392
Proper journalism.

32:48.393 --> 32:50.313
And that surprised you?

32:53.079 --> 32:54.719
Long way from what you do now.

32:55.673 --> 32:58.113
Maybe you should take a closer
look at what we do.

33:12.993 --> 33:15.828
Oh, thanks. Get the chief executive
of St Margaret's to come in

33:15.829 --> 33:18.354
- to see us this morning.
- But we don't have anything on them...

33:18.355 --> 33:21.352
What's her name? Linda Parks?
Yep, tell her to come in.

33:21.353 --> 33:23.512
You want her to just drop everything?

33:23.513 --> 33:25.392
Tell her that we know about Fluostore.

33:25.393 --> 33:28.232
- Fluostore?
- Yep, Fluostore. Spelt like it sounds.

33:28.233 --> 33:29.472
Google it if you get stuck.

33:29.473 --> 33:31.985
Say that we don't want to talk to
her about it over the phone,

33:31.986 --> 33:33.640
and we suspect that she doesn't either.

33:33.665 --> 33:34.678
Right.

33:34.679 --> 33:35.913
Oh, Leona.

33:37.513 --> 33:39.747
Yeah, how, how many friends do you have?

33:39.772 --> 33:40.898
Sorry?

33:40.899 --> 33:43.153
How many people in your life
would you count as friends?

33:44.673 --> 33:47.313
- Good friends?
- Yeah, like what? Three, four?

33:48.039 --> 33:49.319
Um...

33:49.993 --> 33:51.472
15, probably?

33:51.473 --> 33:53.160
15. OK.

33:53.713 --> 33:56.433
Yeah, probably about 15, if we're
just counting the close ones.

34:00.460 --> 34:02.192
Conference!

34:02.193 --> 34:04.760
- I like it but...
- But not enough.

34:04.785 --> 34:06.112
Well, we can pick it up tomorrow.

34:06.113 --> 34:08.272
You said you had something new today?

34:08.273 --> 34:11.487
Yeah, it's an exclusive about
St Margaret's hospital in Leicester,

34:11.487 --> 34:14.072
increased mortality rates. We've got
some material to go through

34:14.072 --> 34:15.513
this morning but it's... it's

34:15.538 --> 34:16.752
- looking solid.
- OK.

34:16.753 --> 34:19.431
And there's this big party last
night, we've got some photos

34:19.433 --> 34:22.112
from the door, people coming in and
out, I don't I don't think

34:22.112 --> 34:24.112
- there's an angle there, particularly.
- OK.

34:24.112 --> 34:27.496
Um, I need to make everyone aware
that next Monday

34:27.496 --> 34:29.351
we are going
to do a different kind of cover.

34:29.353 --> 34:31.431
- What kind of cover?
- Not a wrap-around?

34:31.433 --> 34:33.952
- We need to find new income streams.
- Hang on, wait a minute...

34:33.953 --> 34:37.391
- Even if it is unconventional for us...
-  We can't do a wrap-around.

34:37.393 --> 34:38.831

- Who's the client?
- Um, that's...

34:47.713 --> 34:51.193
- Who is it?
- Um, I believe it's Lydale.

I've been offered five coffees
but no explanation.

36:53.393 --> 36:54.992
Can we get to the point?

36:54.993 --> 36:57.593
The point is you're here.

36:58.180 --> 36:59.240
I'm sorry?

36:59.265 --> 37:01.752
I asked Leona to mention
Fluostore to you,

37:01.753 --> 37:03.792
and you came all the way here.

37:03.793 --> 37:05.872
It's my job to pay attention to concerns

37:05.873 --> 37:07.832
that are raised about the hospital.

37:07.833 --> 37:09.390
I had to look Fluostore up,

37:09.415 --> 37:11.432
- to understand what it was.
- Sure.

37:11.433 --> 37:12.912
What's your concern?

37:12.913 --> 37:15.590
That mortality rates at your
hospital have increased

37:15.591 --> 37:17.440
- in the last year.
- Yes,

37:17.465 --> 37:19.272
we've had an independent investigation

37:19.273 --> 37:23.432
and found that practice and staffing
levels are consistent.

37:23.433 --> 37:24.552
There's no evidence...

37:24.553 --> 37:27.989
A year ago, you started a new
contract with a cleaning company,

37:27.990 --> 37:30.072
- Southern Light.
- We, er...

37:30.073 --> 37:31.552
That's right.

37:31.553 --> 37:34.872
Exactly when the mortality rates
began to increase.

37:34.873 --> 37:37.872
Hospitals start new contracts
all the time.

37:37.873 --> 37:40.272
Catering, heating, maintenance.

37:40.273 --> 37:42.872
As long as the work is done to
a standard, I don't think

37:42.873 --> 37:44.832
you can imply it's having some effect.

37:44.833 --> 37:47.752
If the cleaning was happening less
often, or less thoroughly,

37:47.753 --> 37:48.837
it would get noticed.

37:48.862 --> 37:50.352
Yeah, I went to your
hospital this morning

37:50.353 --> 37:52.184
and spoke to some of the cleaners
there and they would

37:52.185 --> 37:53.912
- agree with you about that.
- Right.

37:53.913 --> 37:57.072
But one of them said that when
the new contractors started,

37:57.073 --> 37:59.352
they were told to use half the
amount of Fluostore

37:59.353 --> 38:01.032
in the disinfectant from a year ago.

38:01.033 --> 38:03.349
They were told there was new
evidence that it would

38:03.350 --> 38:07.352
- make no difference. I...
- Half the amount?

38:07.353 --> 38:09.072
Half the concentration.

38:09.073 --> 38:11.632
Yeah, that could be an oversight,
a rogue manager,

38:11.633 --> 38:13.933
but then I checked what Southern
Light had bid for the cleaning

38:13.934 --> 38:17.660
contract and it was significantly
below the previous cleaning company.

38:18.713 --> 38:20.792
20% less. You're aware of that?

38:20.793 --> 38:23.552
Presumably, it was a big factor in
awarding them the contract.

38:23.553 --> 38:24.992
We always look for value for money.

38:24.993 --> 38:27.255
Did you ask how them how they could
achieve the same service

38:27.256 --> 38:28.438
at a fifth less the cost?

38:28.463 --> 38:30.872
I assumed efficiencies,
methods of practice.

38:30.873 --> 38:32.040
You didn't ask?

38:32.065 --> 38:34.137
- I was impressed but...
- You didn't ask.

38:35.913 --> 38:39.170
The woman that I spoke to said
the concentration was changed back

38:39.171 --> 38:41.352
three weeks ago,
up to its previous level.

38:41.353 --> 38:44.353
Two days after the mortality rate
statistics came out.

38:45.553 --> 38:47.152
Someone made the connection.

38:47.153 --> 38:49.432
Not many people would have had
all that information.

38:49.433 --> 38:51.833
It's been corrected, but a year too late.

38:53.553 --> 38:57.022
- Thank you for raising the concerns.
- Too late for Eve Godwin.

38:57.023 --> 38:58.953
She died of an infection last year.

38:59.460 --> 39:00.872
We'll look into all of it.

39:00.873 --> 39:02.312
We're running the story tomorrow.

39:02.313 --> 39:04.272
We'll approach you
for comment this afternoon,

39:04.273 --> 39:06.233
unless you want to leave a
statement with Leona.

39:07.838 --> 39:09.958
All right. Thank you.

39:10.899 --> 39:11.939
Linda?

39:13.193 --> 39:15.152
Why do you do your job?

39:15.153 --> 39:18.192
I assume that it's because
you want to help people.

39:18.193 --> 39:21.033
I've been in public
service my whole life.

39:23.913 --> 39:27.722
Off the record... "Off the record",
do you really do that?

39:27.723 --> 39:29.753
- Is that a thing?
- Sure.

39:35.633 --> 39:37.993
I keep that hospital running.

39:38.420 --> 39:43.832
The way things are, if I go,
they won't get someone as good,

39:43.833 --> 39:48.912
who understands how it works. That's
not arrogance, that's just true,

39:48.913 --> 39:52.273
and the hospital will decline
and more people will die.

39:52.753 --> 39:53.793
So, yes...

39:54.873 --> 39:57.952
...I made a mistake,
and it's had consequences,

39:57.953 --> 39:59.793
but I've corrected it,

40:00.340 --> 40:03.860
and I'm carrying on, because
that is the right thing to do.

40:05.313 --> 40:07.113
You could just leave this.

40:08.073 --> 40:09.633
Write something else.

40:11.473 --> 40:12.953
I'm good at my job, too.

40:16.992 --> 40:18.232
Right.

40:22.899 --> 40:24.419
You'll have something in an hour.

40:24.612 --> 40:26.092
A statement?

40:27.153 --> 40:28.553
My resignation.

40:37.220 --> 40:38.832
You went there last night?

40:38.833 --> 40:40.673
Yeah, after we spoke.

40:41.252 --> 40:42.932
Got the last train.

40:46.193 --> 40:48.272
Do you think she's right?

40:48.273 --> 40:51.592
That the hospital will get
worse if she leaves?

40:51.593 --> 40:54.752
That's not up to us to decide.
Our job is the truth.

40:54.753 --> 40:57.793
That's important for the relatives
of those people that died.

40:58.060 --> 41:00.392
Important for the other hospital
trusts that might be tempted

41:00.393 --> 41:02.752
to do the same thing and important
for managers to know

41:02.753 --> 41:05.792
that we will hold them accountable
for the decisions that they make.

41:05.793 --> 41:06.820
Right.

41:08.292 --> 41:09.772
Yeah.

41:10.193 --> 41:12.752
Write it. You've got two hours.

41:12.753 --> 41:15.393
DOOR OPENS

41:21.073 --> 41:22.460
Justin?

41:24.073 --> 41:26.233
I'm not doing it. The wrap-around.

41:26.625 --> 41:28.425
We need to find something else.

41:29.793 --> 41:32.352
OK. Well, firstly,
there isn't anything else.

41:32.353 --> 41:34.472
Well, there will be another solution.

41:34.473 --> 41:35.672
You just need to find it.

41:35.673 --> 41:38.952
Secondly, this isn't actually your
choice, the advertising department

41:38.953 --> 41:41.192
are ultimately answerable to the
board, not you.

41:41.193 --> 41:44.015
Furthermore, even if you manage
to persuade them to stop it

41:44.016 --> 41:47.312
in the future, we've already
signed the contract.

41:47.313 --> 41:48.713
It's too late.

42:00.553 --> 42:03.890
Mr Goyle? Sorry? James Edwards.
I'm a reporter from the Herald.

42:03.891 --> 42:05.383
Look, you need to get through official...

42:05.408 --> 42:07.600
Yeah, I've been looking through
your production chain,

42:07.625 --> 42:08.748
getting various figures

42:08.749 --> 42:12.112
from each stage. Manufacture,
transportation, distribution.

42:12.113 --> 42:14.112
What figures? You shouldn't have...

42:14.113 --> 42:17.352
Various employees at various stages
were prepared to talk to me.

42:17.353 --> 42:18.632
Keen, actually.

42:18.633 --> 42:20.512
You don't have much loyalty
in your company.

42:20.513 --> 42:22.192
That's not true. Now, please...

42:22.193 --> 42:24.952
See, the thing is, your whole
business model doesn't add up.

42:24.953 --> 42:28.192
If you manufacture the clothes in
India to the legal standards,

42:28.193 --> 42:31.433
you can't sell them at the price
you do and still make money.

42:33.833 --> 42:35.272
Well, that's simply not true.

42:35.273 --> 42:37.673
Well, here are the figures
that I'm basing that on.

42:41.873 --> 42:43.672
I don't recognise these.

42:43.673 --> 42:46.443
Well, more importantly, the figures
are backed up by these accounts

42:46.444 --> 42:48.720
of the children working in the factories

42:48.721 --> 42:52.433
for criminally low, or no pay.

42:53.092 --> 42:54.932
I've got all that in here.

42:55.633 --> 42:58.432
If you've uncovered any illegal
activities, of course we'll...

42:58.433 --> 43:01.232
I'm sure, but that's not the article
that I'm going to put forward.

43:01.233 --> 43:06.552
I'm going to suggest that your whole
business model is only sustainable

43:06.553 --> 43:10.700
through unethical practice,
and I wondered if you had a comment?

43:12.553 --> 43:14.912
You realise we're one
of the Herald's main clients?

43:14.913 --> 43:16.592
For advertising.

43:16.593 --> 43:18.312
A major campaign launches tomorrow.

43:18.313 --> 43:19.913
Yeah, I know that.

43:21.273 --> 43:22.952
Does your editor know you're here?

43:22.953 --> 43:25.673
She's the one who suggested
I speak to you.

43:26.420 --> 43:28.420
There's two stories that I can write.

43:29.513 --> 43:32.632
About the children that you are
systematically exploiting,

43:32.633 --> 43:36.184
that would do you quite a lot of
reputational damage, I expect.

43:36.185 --> 43:40.932
Or I could write about the dubious
production model that you can

43:40.933 --> 43:44.632
say you've become aware of
and are in the process of changing.

43:44.633 --> 43:49.273
But, in order to write that second
one, I'm going to need a quote.

44:00.180 --> 44:02.329
You need to get that cleaned.
Take it back.

44:02.330 --> 44:03.804
Isn't there someone else who can do that?

44:03.829 --> 44:05.029
Yeah, you.

44:05.030 --> 44:06.992
Just put it in your washing machine.

44:06.993 --> 44:09.228
Cos, mate, you might have a front
page story, but if you lose

44:09.229 --> 44:11.544
a deposit, it's coming out of your
pay. That's the deal.

44:11.545 --> 44:14.632
- This story don't feel good.
- Did you force her to drink?

44:14.633 --> 44:16.469
- No.
- Did you make her say those things?

44:16.494 --> 44:17.752
Fabricate anything?

44:17.753 --> 44:20.152
Was what you recorded
taking place in her private home?

44:20.153 --> 44:22.352
Did you violate the law
in order to obtain the story?

44:22.353 --> 44:24.519
And do you think parents of children
have the right to know

44:24.520 --> 44:25.994
the sort of person teaching them?

44:26.019 --> 44:27.472
- Even on the television.
- Yes.

44:27.473 --> 44:30.593
Then it's truthful.
It's in the public interest.

44:30.939 --> 44:32.739
What's the problem?

44:37.806 --> 44:39.446
Well done.

45:11.713 --> 45:14.232
Holly, I've got something for you.

45:14.233 --> 45:17.193
- Who's it from?
- No idea, it was just dropped off.

45:17.706 --> 45:19.786
Hm, thanks, Nick.

45:31.233 --> 45:32.833
Hey, what's that?

45:34.673 --> 45:38.672
Nothing. More importantly,
"We've come to realise there are

45:38.673 --> 45:40.760
"fundamental flaws in our chain
of production and are going to

45:40.761 --> 45:43.580
"work harder in the next few months
to resolve those issues."

45:43.581 --> 45:46.084
And no wrap-around. Well done, you two.

45:46.085 --> 45:47.512
You didn't use the children's accounts.

45:47.513 --> 45:48.872
Yeah, not in the article.

45:48.873 --> 45:51.352
It's good, but it doesn't solve the
problem that we are losing

45:51.353 --> 45:54.072
a million a week so they're right.

45:54.073 --> 45:56.793
We can't carry on as we are.
Something's got to give.

45:57.655 --> 45:59.633
Sorry, see you tomorrow.

46:01.233 --> 46:02.360
Drink?

46:02.385 --> 46:04.416
No, I... sorry, I can't.
I've got... I'm late

46:04.417 --> 46:06.512
- to meet Simon for dinner.
- I probably shouldn't anyway,

46:06.513 --> 46:08.660
- I've still got loads to do.
- No, no, no, but another night.

46:09.313 --> 46:12.792
Yeah, yeah, whatever. Um, maybe.

46:12.793 --> 46:14.272
Bye.

46:14.273 --> 46:16.982
OK? Bye. Oh, Chris! Chris!

46:18.513 --> 46:21.272
Did you check about Resonance?
Did you ask anyone?

46:21.273 --> 46:24.192
I asked three people and they all
said they hadn't heard of it.

46:24.193 --> 46:26.152
Right, thank you.

46:26.153 --> 46:30.232
Oh, one of them did ask
why I was checking.

46:30.233 --> 46:33.152
Might indicate something. Hard to say.

46:33.153 --> 46:36.953
- Can't push any further, I'm afraid.
- Right, no.

46:46.385 --> 46:47.625
Hi!

46:49.433 --> 46:52.232
What are you doing here?
Have they called you in?

46:52.233 --> 46:54.432
They asked if I wanted to comment.

46:54.433 --> 46:56.752
So I called my press agent, and, yeah,

46:56.753 --> 46:58.472
we're going in to give my
side of the story.

46:58.473 --> 47:01.032
They still want a splash tomorrow
but they'll run a feature

47:01.033 --> 47:03.232
on the website and in the paper
the following day.

47:03.233 --> 47:07.073
- Are you allowed to smoke in public?
- I am now.

47:10.753 --> 47:13.152
You don't seem angry.

47:13.153 --> 47:15.072
Let me tell you three secrets.

47:15.073 --> 47:18.152
Firstly, it's hard to break out of
children's presenting work

47:18.153 --> 47:20.432
into adult presenting.
You get pigeonholed.

47:20.433 --> 47:23.392
Secondly, adult presenting
is much better paid.

47:23.393 --> 47:26.952
Thirdly, you don't hide the fact
you're a journalist very well.

47:26.953 --> 47:28.952
Tomorrow morning, I get fired.

47:28.953 --> 47:31.312
By lunchtime, I'm trending,
more famous than ever.

47:31.313 --> 47:33.272
By the evening, I'm picking new work.

47:33.273 --> 47:36.032
But the whole story we're printing
is about you being caught out.

47:36.033 --> 47:39.992
You think your editor doesn't know?
This is how it works.

47:39.993 --> 47:43.353
- Everyone's a winner.
- Everyone except the children.

47:43.752 --> 47:45.072
Children grow up.

47:46.460 --> 47:48.073
Maybe you should, too.

48:05.113 --> 48:08.193
PHONE RINGS

48:13.673 --> 48:15.460
Hi, Mum.

48:16.593 --> 48:18.220
Yeah, I'm good.

48:19.453 --> 48:20.573
What?

48:22.033 --> 48:28.820
Nah. No, Mum, I wanted to talk
to you. No, no, actually...

48:32.913 --> 48:34.473
Sorry, I got to go.

48:37.412 --> 48:38.972
You all right?

48:42.700 --> 48:44.592
My mum.

48:44.593 --> 48:46.033
Tough day?

48:47.073 --> 48:48.553
No, I just...

48:51.272 --> 48:52.592
Yeah.

48:55.020 --> 48:57.912
I've got to get this washed
but I don't have a washing machine.

48:57.913 --> 49:00.220
So I've got to find a launderette,
and I don't know where.

49:01.153 --> 49:02.380
And...

49:03.778 --> 49:05.345
...I don't even have a coat.

49:06.593 --> 49:08.793
- What is it?
- Oh...

49:15.220 --> 49:16.953
Do you have something you're into?

49:18.353 --> 49:20.673
No, it's fancy dress for a party.

49:21.833 --> 49:23.033
Right.

49:27.672 --> 49:30.392
Well, I've got a washing machine
at home. You can use that.

49:31.819 --> 49:33.059
Really?

49:34.633 --> 49:35.913
That would be great.

49:36.312 --> 49:38.392
Sorry about before. I was drunk.

49:40.279 --> 49:42.319
Oh, it's OK.

49:45.099 --> 49:47.139
You got an umbrella?

49:57.753 --> 50:01.592
PHONE RINGS

50:01.593 --> 50:05.192
- Hi, how are you?
- I'm good, I'm good, thank you.

50:05.193 --> 50:07.592
Er, it's just a quick question.
It's what the girl said,

50:07.593 --> 50:09.992
at the end of the interview.
I'm pretty sure you heard it

50:09.993 --> 50:12.086
and I'm just worried that you're
protecting me from something.

50:12.087 --> 50:14.363
But I want to know
if you heard what she said?

50:14.364 --> 50:16.032
Look, I could have it picked out,

50:16.033 --> 50:18.633
I can get it translated by someone
else but I just thought...

50:19.953 --> 50:22.352
She asked if you believed her.

50:22.353 --> 50:23.952
Why would she say that?

50:23.953 --> 50:26.072
I wanted you to write the story.

50:26.073 --> 50:28.592
When she said that, I didn't know.

50:28.593 --> 50:30.832
Maybe she was just worried you
wouldn't believe her.

50:30.833 --> 50:33.072
Or that she wasn't telling the truth.

50:33.073 --> 50:34.872
People knew you were asking questions.

50:34.873 --> 50:36.752
Some of the children wanted to meet you.

50:36.753 --> 50:38.113
So, maybe, they...

50:38.780 --> 50:41.635
But it doesn't affect the story.
You saw the conditions.

50:41.636 --> 50:43.872
The other children were all
consistent and believable.

50:43.873 --> 50:46.193
One mistake like that can sink a story.

50:46.540 --> 50:48.032
Not to mention get me fired.

50:48.033 --> 50:49.832
Yes, but it was too important.

50:49.833 --> 50:51.473
You had to believe it.

50:52.473 --> 50:54.796
OK, thanks.

50:54.797 --> 50:56.713
- Um, speak soon.
- Bye.

51:00.918 --> 51:02.718
HE EXHALES

51:04.433 --> 51:06.552
It's a good story
you've got for tomorrow.

51:06.553 --> 51:08.273
Rosie Fisher on disability rights.

51:09.873 --> 51:12.300
- How did you see that?
- Spies.

51:13.353 --> 51:14.913
Who put it together?

51:15.404 --> 51:16.563
Holly Evans.

51:16.564 --> 51:17.792
It's not her name on it.

51:17.793 --> 51:18.992
Yeah, she's an editor.

51:18.993 --> 51:21.872
She finds them and gives them to
other people, but it's all her.

51:21.873 --> 51:24.752
And the other one.
The NHS story, is that her, too?

51:24.753 --> 51:26.672
I am not discussing it.

51:26.673 --> 51:28.526
She's wasted where she is.

51:28.527 --> 51:31.232
- Don't even think about it.
- I know, but I am.

51:31.233 --> 51:34.232
- She'd never work for you!
- The number of times I've heard that,

51:34.233 --> 51:35.740
it's all about making the right offer.

51:36.153 --> 51:40.032
- What are you running tomorrow?
- Oh... Wait and see.

51:40.033 --> 51:41.472
Big splash.

51:41.473 --> 51:42.633
Mm, important.

51:43.593 --> 51:45.992
Politics, economy, defence?

51:45.993 --> 51:48.254
I don't like the judgment in your voice.

51:48.279 --> 51:49.312
Guilty conscience?

51:49.313 --> 51:50.833
Not at all.

51:57.793 --> 51:59.712
I broke up with Sarah last night.

51:59.713 --> 52:04.232
You... Oh, God, Duncan.

52:04.233 --> 52:05.792
That's... I'm sorry.

52:05.793 --> 52:09.020
It's fine. She'll find someone new.

52:10.113 --> 52:12.530
I guarantee she's already
thinking about it.

52:12.555 --> 52:13.628
But Fred?

52:13.629 --> 52:15.840
Fred will be glad to see
the back of me, probably.

52:16.198 --> 52:17.589
I doubt it.

52:20.993 --> 52:22.873
PHONE VIBRATES

52:27.680 --> 52:30.180
_

52:41.800 --> 52:43.800
_

52:48.193 --> 52:51.152
Foreign Secretary
in five minutes, Prime Minister.

52:51.153 --> 52:52.593
Thank you.

52:54.433 --> 52:57.032
As she said to you,
no-one loses out, really.

52:57.033 --> 52:58.752
They're all as bad as each other.

52:58.753 --> 53:01.032
If all they want is money and fame,
let them have it.

53:01.033 --> 53:04.112
- So, what's your problem?
- My name's on it, and my photo.

53:04.113 --> 53:06.752
- People will see.
- Your parents.

53:06.753 --> 53:09.232
My parents are left wing, Herald readers.

53:09.233 --> 53:11.752
Both university lecturers.
They hate the Post.

53:11.753 --> 53:13.432
Mum says it's sexist, racist trash.

53:13.433 --> 53:15.520
This is the worst thing I could be doing.

53:15.545 --> 53:17.057
That's not true.

53:19.313 --> 53:22.032
Actually, my dad's probably got
a Google alert on my name so...

53:22.033 --> 53:24.441
Then you'd better call
them and tell them.

53:24.466 --> 53:25.689
They'll hate me.

53:25.690 --> 53:28.592
I doubt it! They love you.

53:28.593 --> 53:30.467
I'll tell them and they'd say the
right things

53:30.468 --> 53:33.513
but I'd sense their
disappointment. I'd know.

53:34.140 --> 53:35.312
Well, if you're proud of what
you're doing,

53:35.313 --> 53:36.833
it doesn't matter what they think.

53:38.433 --> 53:39.833
Are you proud?

53:43.859 --> 53:45.219
Yeah.

53:46.685 --> 53:48.325
OK, then.

53:54.513 --> 53:56.472
Are you really sleeping in your car?

53:56.473 --> 53:58.752
I need it for reporting.

53:58.753 --> 54:00.860
It's more useful than a flat.

54:04.873 --> 54:08.312
So, actually, I'm looking
for a new flatmate.

54:08.313 --> 54:10.752
I've been unlucky recently.
My last flatmate died

54:10.753 --> 54:13.192
so the bar's pretty low.
Stay alive, don't be a dick.

54:13.193 --> 54:16.072
You strike me as someone
who wants to be on their own.

54:16.073 --> 54:17.432
Yeah, but I need the money.

54:17.433 --> 54:21.232
I can't afford it.
I'm on try-out at the moment, so...

54:21.233 --> 54:23.780
- Yeah, but you're doing well?
- Yeah.

54:24.593 --> 54:27.792
Then it might improve. Three weeks.
You try to make the rent.

54:27.793 --> 54:29.260
If you don't, I kick you out.

54:34.713 --> 54:37.620
Dee? Was that her name?

54:39.713 --> 54:42.220
- Yeah.
- You were close?

54:42.793 --> 54:44.832
We'd chat at the end of the day.
She'd tell me

54:44.833 --> 54:46.181
that I worked too hard, worried too much.

54:46.206 --> 54:47.912
So, who do you talk to now?

54:47.913 --> 54:50.072
Is that why you want a flatmate?
Cos, actually,

54:50.073 --> 54:51.833
you must earn enough to be on your own.

54:53.553 --> 54:55.073
I might go to bed.

54:59.513 --> 55:00.952
Holly.

55:00.953 --> 55:02.232
Yeah?

55:02.233 --> 55:04.553
You work too hard and worry too much.

55:08.699 --> 55:10.619
Three weeks would be good.

55:12.559 --> 55:14.319
Call your parents.

55:18.292 --> 55:19.932
DOOR CLOSES

55:41.553 --> 55:43.193
Hi, Mum, it's me.

55:44.553 --> 55:46.153
I've got something to tell you.

55:48.753 --> 55:51.300
So, now we're both single.

55:56.193 --> 55:58.473
What does this industry do to people?

56:00.113 --> 56:01.473
Keeps us sharp.

56:09.233 --> 56:11.152
It keeps us alone.

56:11.153 --> 56:12.980
There are worse things.

56:26.233 --> 56:30.260
It means we see the world
exactly as it is.

56:31.873 --> 56:35.460
No distractions, no loyalty.

56:38.473 --> 56:40.793
We're pure.

56:42.393 --> 56:44.113
E-MAIL NOTIFICATION

56:51.640 --> 56:54.360
_

57:18.033 --> 57:19.512
Can I show you this?

57:19.513 --> 57:22.552
Joshua West? You realise he gives
away half his earnings to charity.

57:22.553 --> 57:23.832
Maybe now we know why.

57:23.833 --> 57:25.592
I knew I wasn't the only one.

57:25.593 --> 57:26.937
Sometimes he'd hold so tight

57:26.962 --> 57:28.712
- there'd be bruises.
- Prime Minister.

57:28.713 --> 57:31.552
A reporter from the Herald called
about Resonance last week.

57:31.553 --> 57:33.912
- Let it go away.
- Oh...

57:33.913 --> 57:36.432
You want to make an impact,
to take risks?

57:36.433 --> 57:38.353
This is the moment.
