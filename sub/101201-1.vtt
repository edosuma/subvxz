00:41.584 --> 00:43.961
REPORTER: There may be no more
dangerous job in the world

00:44.044 --> 00:46.714
these days than being an
undercover agent for the United

00:46.797 --> 00:51.302
States Drug Enforcement
Administration, the DEA,

00:51.385 --> 00:54.889
the federal agency which is at
war with ruthless drug dealers

00:54.972 --> 00:57.808
around the world.

00:57.892 --> 01:00.728
Tonight, one of those
undercover agents is missing.

01:00.811 --> 01:02.897
Apparently, the victim
of drug vengeance.

01:04.732 --> 01:06.609
REPORTER: Enrique Camarena
was reportedly

01:06.692 --> 01:09.653
kidnapped by four armed
men in Guadalajara, Mexico.

01:09.737 --> 01:12.406
The hostages' whereabouts
and condition unknown.

01:12.490 --> 01:15.618
REPORTER: Camarena left the
US consulate on February 7,

01:15.701 --> 01:17.578
intending to meet
his wife for lunch,

01:17.661 --> 01:21.165
and was apparently abducted
less than a half a block away.

01:21.248 --> 01:23.167
A small army of
Mexican Federal

01:23.250 --> 01:25.878
Police and American drug agents
are searching for Camarena.

01:25.961 --> 01:27.838
But so far they
have found nothing.

01:30.925 --> 01:32.802
REPORTER: US inspectors are
making a thorough search

01:32.885 --> 01:35.346
of more than half the cars
crossing into this country

01:35.429 --> 01:37.139
along the entire Mexican border

01:37.223 --> 01:39.642
from San Ysidro, California,
to Brownsville, Texas.

01:39.725 --> 01:41.977
REPORTER: Motorists at the
busiest border crossing

01:42.061 --> 01:44.230
at San Ysidro, near
San Diego, have

01:44.313 --> 01:45.981
had to wait up to nine hours.

01:46.065 --> 01:47.942
REPORTER: Although the
White House denies it,

01:48.025 --> 01:50.778
reliable sources tell NBC News
President Reagan has spoken

01:50.861 --> 01:52.738
to Mexican president
De La Madrid

01:52.822 --> 01:54.949
about the case of
Enrique Camarena.

01:55.032 --> 01:58.077
ABC News has learned that
Camarena had uncovered evidence

01:58.160 --> 02:00.037
indicating that high
Mexican law enforcement

02:00.120 --> 02:02.289
agents were involved
with the drug smugglers.

02:07.294 --> 02:10.005
I've had this little
thorn in my heart

02:10.089 --> 02:14.301
knowing the truth about what
really happened to Kiki.

02:14.385 --> 02:19.265
The US intelligence officials
ordered the kidnapping and

02:19.348 --> 02:22.601
interrogation of Kiki Camarena.

02:25.604 --> 02:29.608
The Camarena case is still
being covered up to this day.

02:29.692 --> 02:32.027
And I want the world
to know the truth.

02:32.152 --> 02:33.946
It's time.

02:34.029 --> 02:37.741
And if I die doing it, well,
that's what God wanted.

03:05.686 --> 03:08.063
PRESIDENT NIXON: We must wage
what I have called total war

03:08.147 --> 03:11.734
against public enemy number
one in the United States,

03:11.817 --> 03:14.278
problem of dangerous drugs.

03:14.361 --> 03:16.697
NARRATOR: In 1973,
President Nixon

03:16.780 --> 03:19.658
created the Drug Enforcement
Administration to fight

03:19.742 --> 03:23.370
America's new war on drugs.

03:23.454 --> 03:26.123
The DEA used undercover
narcotics agents,

03:26.206 --> 03:29.793
known as narcs, to bust
traffickers in the US

03:29.877 --> 03:31.921
and around the world.

03:32.004 --> 03:35.424
In 1980, the drug war
expanded to Mexico,

03:35.507 --> 03:37.635
where a group of
marijuana growers

03:37.718 --> 03:40.012
had relocated from the
mountains of Sinaloa

03:40.095 --> 03:42.473
to the city of
Guadalajara to forge

03:42.556 --> 03:45.601
Mexico's first drug cartel.

03:45.684 --> 03:50.898
Rafael Caro Quintero,
Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo,

03:50.981 --> 03:53.984
and Miguel Felix Gallardo,
became the most

03:54.068 --> 03:55.945
powerful drug lords of the era.

03:59.365 --> 04:03.243
In 1985, they conspired
to kidnap, torture,

04:03.327 --> 04:06.622
and murder DEA
Agent Kiki Camarena,

04:06.705 --> 04:09.500
resulting in their downfall.

04:09.583 --> 04:12.920
The disintegration of
the Guadalajara cartel

04:13.003 --> 04:16.715
plunged Mexico into
violence and led to the rise

04:16.799 --> 04:20.386
of Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman.

04:20.469 --> 04:23.722
Since then, more than
125,000 people have

04:23.806 --> 04:26.767
died in Mexico's cartel wars.

04:26.850 --> 04:31.397
But to this day, Camarena's
murder looms above them all.

04:31.480 --> 04:34.692
For 35 years, the truth
behind his killing

04:34.775 --> 04:36.735
has remained a
closely guarded secret

04:36.819 --> 04:38.445
at the highest
levels of government

04:38.529 --> 04:41.824
in Mexico and the US.

04:41.907 --> 04:44.576
This is the story of the
man who was murdered,

04:44.660 --> 04:46.537
the men who killed
him, and the one

04:46.620 --> 04:50.124
man who risked everything to
find out what really happened

04:50.207 --> 04:51.083
and why.

05:27.494 --> 05:31.331
When my mom was like 16,
she got pregnant with me.

05:31.415 --> 05:34.668
And my grandmother, who
was a very strict Catholic,

05:34.752 --> 05:37.421
said, you got to
leave the house.

05:37.504 --> 05:39.339
So my mom went
and became friends

05:39.423 --> 05:43.761
with these ladies that were
like gypsies that told fortunes.

05:45.846 --> 05:47.806
They took her in and
they said, listen,

05:47.890 --> 05:50.434
you know, you learn this trade,
and you'll always have money.

05:51.518 --> 05:53.520
Your present, your past,
and your future.

05:53.812 --> 05:56.315
Present, past, and future.

05:56.398 --> 05:58.650
That's the way she
supported herself

05:58.734 --> 06:00.486
when she was pregnant with me.

06:00.569 --> 06:03.072
She married my dad,
who lived in Mexico.

06:03.155 --> 06:06.617
Before I was born, they
migrated to the United States,

06:06.700 --> 06:08.827
and I was the oldest
of six brothers.

06:09.620 --> 06:11.789
You are going to be happy,

06:11.872 --> 06:14.500
because you feel that some force
is protecting you.

06:14.583 --> 06:17.753
You will always care
for your family.

06:18.337 --> 06:20.756
We grew up in South
Tucson, Arizona, which

06:20.839 --> 06:23.509
is mainly a Hispanic community.

06:23.592 --> 06:26.303
All of my Anglo friends
spoke Spanglish,

06:26.386 --> 06:28.097
half English half Spanish.

06:28.180 --> 06:30.641
So I grew up speaking
both languages.

06:33.852 --> 06:37.231
You are going to receive
a letter or some news

06:37.314 --> 06:39.733
about the death
of someone you know,

06:39.817 --> 06:41.777
someone you care about.

06:41.860 --> 06:43.362
It will bring you sadness,

06:43.445 --> 06:46.907
and you will have to
fight for your life.

06:49.660 --> 06:53.455
Once I did my time in the US
military during the Vietnam War

06:53.539 --> 06:57.292
and reported home, my
dad had broken his back,

06:57.376 --> 06:59.878
and he wasn't working, so
there was no money coming in.

06:59.962 --> 07:01.713
So I started looking
at the unemployment

07:01.797 --> 07:04.133
section of the
newspaper, and there was

07:04.216 --> 07:06.385
openings for police officers.

07:06.468 --> 07:10.305
And the last thing I wanted to
be growing up was a policeman.

07:10.389 --> 07:12.224
But then I found out
that my little brother,

07:12.307 --> 07:17.354
who was 12 years old,
was hooked on heroin.

07:17.437 --> 07:20.816
The only time that
I saw my dad cry--

07:20.899 --> 07:23.277
when he would see his son
be dragged in by the US

07:23.360 --> 07:25.612
Marshals in chains.

07:28.240 --> 07:31.618
And I remember the tears
rolling down my dad's face.

07:31.702 --> 07:34.830
And it hurt me dearly
because I adored my father.

07:34.913 --> 07:36.415
And I would grab him and
say, Dad, don't worry.

07:36.498 --> 07:38.375
I'm going to do
something about this.

07:38.458 --> 07:41.003
These guys are going to pay
that addict people like this.

07:41.086 --> 07:43.088
I'm going to arrest
every drug dealer I can.

08:48.904 --> 08:54.284
Then he started school
in the US at Calexico.

08:54.368 --> 08:57.329
And that's where we
wound up meeting.

08:59.790 --> 09:03.627
A lot of the families traveled

Kiki and I graduated in 1966.

At 18, Kiki had a vision

09:24.398 --> 09:29.444
He wanted to marry me
and be an FBI agent.

09:29.528 --> 09:32.489
I thought, how could you

09:32.572 --> 09:36.368
be so serious about

09:36.410 --> 09:42.541

He always wanted to

One day I was writing tickets,

10:37.179 --> 10:39.765
I liked it. But it
was very, very dangerous.

10:39.848 --> 10:41.725
I'm surprised I didn't
run into somebody

10:41.808 --> 10:44.353

So I felt uncomfortable
going with the informants,

10:55.530 --> 10:57.908
and meeting these Mexican drug
dealers, and they look at me

10:57.991 --> 10:59.951
and says, are you
sure you're not a cop?

11:00.035 --> 11:01.870
"Man, I don't even
have papers."

11:01.953 --> 11:03.914
"I don't even have green papers.
I'm here illegally."

11:03.997 --> 11:05.707
I became an adrenaline junkie.

11:05.791 --> 11:07.334
I liked the rush
that you got.

11:07.417 --> 11:09.294
You are afraid you might

11:15.967 --> 11:18.804
When I was making buys
for the state police,

11:18.887 --> 11:20.931
an informant came in and
said that he had met a very

11:21.014 --> 11:23.058
big heroin dealer
from Sinaloa.

11:23.141 --> 11:28.730
So they said, go in there, buy
an ounce of heroin for $10,000,

11:28.814 --> 11:29.856
and pay him.

11:32.359 --> 11:34.361
So I walk in, and
of course, I can't

11:34.444 --> 11:35.987
act like I'm experienced
with this guy,

11:36.071 --> 11:38.281
because this guy is
a big drug dealer.

11:38.365 --> 11:40.117
He was very well dressed,
a lot of jewelry,

11:40.200 --> 11:41.701
about 50 years old,
and I tell him--

11:41.785 --> 11:44.162
"Look, my mom
is in very bad shape.

11:44.246 --> 11:47.165
She is very sick,
she has cancer.

11:47.249 --> 11:49.626
And I know nothing
about this business.

11:49.709 --> 11:51.378
I know nothing about heroin."

11:51.461 --> 11:53.839
And he says,
"This is amazing heroin,

11:53.922 --> 11:55.424
comes directly from the lab."

11:55.507 --> 11:57.968
And I said,
"Please, please."

11:58.051 --> 12:01.847
"Because if I take them
something that's been cut...

12:01.930 --> 12:04.266
They'll kill me."

12:04.349 --> 12:08.270
And he says,
"Calm down, calm down, kid.

12:08.353 --> 12:10.647
This is pure heroin."

12:10.730 --> 12:12.315
And he puts down
an ounce of heroin.

12:13.316 --> 12:14.776
"Did you bring the money?"

12:14.860 --> 12:16.695
So I had $10,000
of marked bills.

12:16.778 --> 12:18.321
And I gave him
the $10,000.

12:18.405 --> 12:19.990
"Take it.

12:20.073 --> 12:22.242
And I have a gift for you."

12:22.325 --> 12:24.244
And he handed me
this bag, plastic bag,

12:24.327 --> 12:25.787
full of white powder.

12:25.871 --> 12:28.832
"It's pure cocaine."

12:28.915 --> 12:30.125
"Is it cocaine?"

12:30.208 --> 12:31.376
"Yes."

12:31.460 --> 12:34.254
I'm acting dumb, naive.

12:35.797 --> 12:37.257
"Thank you."

12:38.884 --> 12:40.886
"Listen, sell this cocaine

12:40.969 --> 12:43.889
and pay your mom's
medical bills."

12:43.972 --> 12:46.516
It's a gift from me to you.

12:46.600 --> 12:48.435
I like you, dude, and by the
way, get out of this business.

12:48.518 --> 12:49.853
You don't belong
in this business.

12:49.936 --> 12:51.646
You're too young
and too naive

12:51.730 --> 12:53.648
and too nice of a guy
to be involved in this shit.

12:53.732 --> 12:57.194
I don't want to see you again,
but we're going do this deal.

12:57.277 --> 13:02.032
So I go outside, open the trunk,
and here comes the cavalry,

13:02.115 --> 13:04.784
and they go in and
arrest everybody.

13:04.868 --> 13:08.497
We had like a SWAT
team out there.

13:08.580 --> 13:11.374
And as they're walking him out
of the hotel in handcuffs--

13:12.709 --> 13:15.045
"You're really good, kid."

13:15.128 --> 13:18.089
And I says,
"Oh well, thank you."

13:21.301 --> 13:23.595
Later that night,
everybody goes to a bar

13:23.678 --> 13:25.388
to celebrate the arrest.

13:25.472 --> 13:27.807
It wasn't my case.

13:27.891 --> 13:32.562
The case agent was another
agent, didn't speak Spanish,

13:32.646 --> 13:34.731
and everybody's going to
him and congratulating him.

13:34.814 --> 13:36.900
Hey, that was a great case.

13:36.983 --> 13:40.070
And his boss tells him,
hey, I want to put you

13:40.153 --> 13:42.531
in for an award on this case.

13:42.614 --> 13:45.742
I'm sitting over here,
drinking a beer by myself.

13:45.825 --> 13:48.119
And I said, "What about me?"

13:48.203 --> 13:49.663
"What about you?"

13:49.746 --> 13:51.248
I said, "Well, you
know, I think I did

13:51.331 --> 13:52.958
a pretty good job undercover.
Didn't I?"

13:53.041 --> 13:55.043
And they said,
"Man, even a monkey can

13:55.126 --> 13:56.628
buy dope
if you give him money."

13:56.711 --> 13:58.672
And I felt very
small after that.

13:58.755 --> 14:00.507
I felt very hurt.

14:00.590 --> 14:04.594
However, though,
the DEA was there.

14:04.678 --> 14:06.596
And the supervisor pulled
me aside, "Why don't

14:06.680 --> 14:08.390
you come over, work for us?"

14:08.473 --> 14:09.975
These are state police.

14:10.058 --> 14:11.768
And I said, OK, I'd love to.

14:48.221 --> 14:49.973
I was born...

14:50.056 --> 14:52.183
in Cordoba city,

14:52.267 --> 14:54.352
state of Veracruz, Mexico,

14:54.436 --> 15:02.068
at 9:35 AM in 1961,

15:02.152 --> 15:04.321
on July 31st.

15:06.031 --> 15:10.785
In 1975, I left my house
and asked for a ride

15:10.869 --> 15:14.664
to the United States
with the hope

15:14.748 --> 15:17.792
of being someone in life.

15:17.876 --> 15:20.337
An honest, fair person.

15:20.420 --> 15:23.256
I believed in
the justice of the U.S.,

15:23.340 --> 15:25.425
in the good ones.

15:28.261 --> 15:30.221
I believed in America.

15:31.181 --> 15:33.558
My hope was to join

15:34.100 --> 15:36.853
the U.S. Army.

15:39.397 --> 15:42.942
The Army didn't admit me,
they rejected me.

15:43.026 --> 15:46.863
I left the U.S. disappointed.

15:46.946 --> 15:49.699
When I went back to Guadalajara,

15:50.200 --> 15:53.036
I joined the state police,

15:53.119 --> 15:54.496
to do justice.

15:55.080 --> 15:56.081
To do justice for...

15:56.164 --> 15:58.041
all the innocent people.

16:00.251 --> 16:03.797
When I joined the police,
I was a very honest man.

16:29.155 --> 16:32.117
On one occasion my partner
and I were on patrol...

16:33.326 --> 16:35.870
We stopped to eat some tacos.

16:35.954 --> 16:38.832
Typical Mexican street tacos.

16:40.125 --> 16:44.170
We saw two guys standing there.

16:45.004 --> 16:48.216
And I spotted that one of them
was carrying a handgun.

16:48.299 --> 16:50.719
He tried to reach for his gun,

16:50.802 --> 16:53.555
but I told him, "Don't do it
or you'll die here.

16:53.930 --> 16:55.682
Hands up."

16:55.765 --> 16:57.267
And I took his gun.

16:57.350 --> 17:00.520
I open the trunk

17:00.603 --> 17:03.231
and find
three kilos of cocaine.

17:03.314 --> 17:07.277
And you know when guys
like that are connected.

17:07.360 --> 17:11.322
And believe me, I never
wanted to mess with Narcos.

17:11.406 --> 17:13.992
Because I knew better.

17:34.471 --> 17:36.639
INTERVIEWER: Why do you want
to tell your story?

17:36.723 --> 17:38.767
Why do you think
it's important?

17:39.809 --> 17:42.604
I feel I have to do it.

17:42.687 --> 17:47.609
To ask humanity for
some kind of forgiveness,

17:47.692 --> 17:54.073
apologize, for all the harm
I personally did.

18:02.582 --> 18:05.543
These are real facts that

18:05.627 --> 18:08.546
my enemies want to destroy,

18:08.630 --> 18:10.089
but they can't,

18:10.173 --> 18:12.050
unless they kill me first.

18:12.133 --> 18:13.635
That's why I tell my story.

18:27.732 --> 18:29.108
BERRELLEZ:
Southern Arizona
was a good place

18:29.192 --> 18:31.194
to start my career as a narc.

18:35.365 --> 18:37.075
We would go from
the United States

18:37.158 --> 18:39.202
into Mexico all the time,
pursuing drug dealers

18:39.285 --> 18:42.539
and pursuing drug
investigations.

18:42.622 --> 18:46.709
It gave me a taste of how
things worked in Mexico.

18:46.793 --> 18:48.920
It's like a different planet.

18:49.003 --> 18:50.421
They work another set of rules.

18:50.505 --> 18:52.799
There's no Miranda
Rights down there.

18:52.882 --> 18:55.426
There was an occasion
where the Comandante

18:55.510 --> 18:57.846
Juan Tapia calls me--
Mexico.

18:57.929 --> 18:59.347
Hector, he says, we
just arrested two

18:59.430 --> 19:02.433
gringos with
a stolen airplane.

19:02.517 --> 19:05.937
I need you to come over
here and translate for me.

19:06.020 --> 19:07.981
So I get there.
And one of them right away

19:08.064 --> 19:11.651
says if
that comandante thinks

19:11.734 --> 19:14.654
that I'm going
to tell him anything

19:14.737 --> 19:17.991
about the plane, he's loco.

19:18.074 --> 19:24.122
I want my lawyer, and I
want my lawyer right now.

19:24.205 --> 19:26.124
He was about this tall,
little, short, fat guy.

19:26.207 --> 19:28.459
And I says, "Comandante,
he says, no."

19:28.543 --> 19:30.628
"I already know what he said."

19:30.712 --> 19:33.047
"Bring him his lawyer.
Bring the 'chicharra'
to this bastard.

19:33.131 --> 19:35.008
He wants his lawyer."

19:38.303 --> 19:41.598
Well, they grab him,
start tearing his shirt off,
and take his pants off.

19:41.681 --> 19:43.892
He's standing there naked, and
his friend's watching this.

19:43.975 --> 19:45.435
So they bring this cattle prod.

19:45.518 --> 19:48.187
It's got 18 batteries on it.

19:48.271 --> 19:51.357
He says,
"This is your lawyer.

19:51.441 --> 19:53.443
Bend him over."

19:53.526 --> 19:56.696
So they just start giving
him electrical shocks.

19:56.779 --> 19:59.657
You can see the sparks
fly off of his testicles.

19:59.741 --> 20:01.367
"Tell the comandante
that I'm ready to talk."

20:01.451 --> 20:03.494
"Tell him, I don't
want to talk to him."

20:03.578 --> 20:05.079
"Tell him to sit
down and shut up."

20:05.163 --> 20:06.956
Now his friend, "Are you
going to tell me now

20:07.040 --> 20:08.374
"where you stole the
plane and everything,

20:08.458 --> 20:09.876
or you want a lawyer too?"

20:09.959 --> 20:11.002
He says, "No, sir, I'm fine.

20:11.085 --> 20:13.254
I don't need a lawyer."

20:13.338 --> 20:14.756
This is one of my very
first cases there.

20:14.839 --> 20:16.591
So I'm learning
that this is normal.

20:16.674 --> 20:18.635
They do that every time
they pick up somebody.

20:18.718 --> 20:21.512
After that, of course,
it became common practice.

20:21.596 --> 20:23.264
All the waterboarding,
the beatings,

20:23.348 --> 20:25.350
the cattle prods,
and all that stuff.

20:25.433 --> 20:28.227
That's exactly how they
worked cases back in the '70s

20:28.311 --> 20:29.562
and '80s, back then in Mexico.

20:53.628 --> 20:56.422
MIKA CAMARENA: When Kiki
first got to Guadalajara,

20:56.506 --> 21:00.343
he went to scout,
and he could not wait

21:00.426 --> 21:02.595
to get a case started.

21:02.679 --> 21:05.098
He was not a desk person.

21:05.181 --> 21:09.185
He put all his soul and
mind into working undercover.

21:09.268 --> 21:15.066
He loved the action,
and so that was a worry to me.

21:15.149 --> 21:17.777
I knew that he was not
going to let go until he

21:17.860 --> 21:21.698
accomplished what he wanted.

21:29.122 --> 21:30.498
JAIME KUYKENDALL:
I was the agent

21:30.581 --> 21:32.250
in charge of
the office there.

21:32.333 --> 21:35.169
Enforcement actions were
not our primary purpose.

21:35.253 --> 21:38.423
Our job was to identify
traffickers and trafficking

21:38.506 --> 21:40.675
patterns, because we
were not authorized

21:40.758 --> 21:43.594
to take enforcement actions.

21:43.678 --> 21:46.556
Kiki was dedicated
to his job,

21:46.639 --> 21:48.766
and he was good
at developing informants,

21:48.850 --> 21:50.601
at guiding informants,

21:50.685 --> 21:53.104
and using that
information to find out what

21:53.187 --> 21:54.897
the traffickers were doing,
both in Mexico

21:54.981 --> 21:57.066
and in the United States.

21:57.150 --> 21:59.235
So we were just
working on the major

21:59.318 --> 22:01.320
growing
and smuggling groups,

22:01.404 --> 22:03.448
using Guadalajara
as a trampoline

22:03.531 --> 22:05.950
into the United States.

22:06.034 --> 22:07.285
The traffickers
lived and operated

22:07.368 --> 22:08.995
in Guadalajara with impunity.

22:09.078 --> 22:10.413
Nobody bothered them.

22:10.496 --> 22:12.248
It was their city.

22:12.331 --> 22:16.085
They owned businesses,
hotels, restaurants.

22:16.169 --> 22:21.257
They traveled in luxury cars,
convoys at times, armed.

22:21.340 --> 22:23.259
They all had some sort
of an official credential

22:23.342 --> 22:25.511
issued by either
the federal government

22:25.595 --> 22:27.221
or the state government.

22:27.305 --> 22:30.600
They all had
bodyguards, and we lived

22:30.683 --> 22:31.934
in and around where they lived.

22:32.018 --> 22:35.688
They knew us and
had made threats

22:35.772 --> 22:37.774
against some of the
agents in the office

22:37.857 --> 22:39.650
and against the
office in general.

22:43.863 --> 22:47.408
MIKA: One time,
I had gone to the market.

22:47.492 --> 22:52.455
And I see a car behind
me that's not passing me.

22:52.538 --> 22:57.001
And so that made me
suspicious, because in Mexico,

22:57.085 --> 23:00.546
nobody drives behind you.

23:00.630 --> 23:03.633
And then, all of a sudden,
he started to pass me.

23:03.716 --> 23:05.802
He went right along
the side of my car,

23:05.885 --> 23:11.474
and they just stared at
us, didn't say a word.

23:11.557 --> 23:13.434
That means,
we know who you are.

23:33.871 --> 23:35.998
My job as lead prosecutor
in the Camarena case

23:36.082 --> 23:40.253
is hands down the hardest thing
I've ever done professionally.

23:40.336 --> 23:42.839
The drug cartel put
a contract on my life.

23:42.922 --> 23:45.383
I had 24-hour US
Marshal protection.

23:45.466 --> 23:47.468
I carried a firearm,
a Smith & Wesson

23:47.552 --> 23:51.764
357 Magnum revolver with a 2
and 1/2 inch barrel, for years.

23:54.517 --> 23:58.938
In the 1980s, it was
the wild, wild west,

23:59.021 --> 24:01.524
when it came to
the drug cartels.

24:01.607 --> 24:03.901
The most powerful,
the wealthiest,

24:03.985 --> 24:06.112
the most violent
cartel in the world

24:06.195 --> 24:08.406
was based out of
Guadalajara, Mexico.

24:12.118 --> 24:18.416
It consisted of killers, drug
dealers, corrupt Mexican cops,

24:18.499 --> 24:21.127
politicians on the take.

24:21.210 --> 24:29.093
It was a multi-headed hydra,
and it saw itself as invincible.

24:29.177 --> 24:32.138
The Guadalajara
Mexican cartel was

24:32.221 --> 24:35.391
run by three very,
very powerful, violent,

24:35.474 --> 24:38.144
and wealthy individuals--

24:38.227 --> 24:44.275
Rafael Caro Quintero,
Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo,

24:44.358 --> 24:47.737
and Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo.

24:47.820 --> 24:49.071
They ran the show.

24:49.155 --> 24:50.448
They called the shots.

24:56.996 --> 24:59.874
I was in the Metropolitan
Homicide unit

24:59.957 --> 25:02.752
in the city of Guadalajara,
in Jalisco,

25:03.169 --> 25:06.297
when we heard on the radio,

25:06.380 --> 25:08.966
"All units
proceed with caution

25:10.218 --> 25:12.470
to the American Motors Hotel."

25:17.433 --> 25:19.352
When we arrived at the hotel,

25:19.435 --> 25:23.064
I saw our commander
with another person,

25:23.981 --> 25:26.317
with Miguel Angel
Felix Gallardo.

25:30.947 --> 25:34.533
When we entered the room we saw

25:34.617 --> 25:36.369
that blood
was splattered everywhere.

25:36.452 --> 25:37.954
It smelled like shit.

25:38.037 --> 25:39.705
It smelled terrible,

25:39.789 --> 25:41.749
because a body was dismembered.

25:41.832 --> 25:46.587
You couldn't tell
if it was male or female.

25:46.671 --> 25:51.050
There were legs, head, arms,
all dismembered.

25:51.133 --> 25:54.053
And there were two guys
sitting there, young guys.

25:54.136 --> 25:57.056
One I recognized as
"El Chapo" Guzman.

26:01.602 --> 26:05.356
He and his partner
had committed the murder

26:05.439 --> 26:07.775
and dismemberment.

26:07.858 --> 26:11.445
They were both
laughing with impunity,

26:11.529 --> 26:15.157
and they were high on drugs.

26:15.950 --> 26:17.910
And Miguel Angel
Felix Gallardo was

26:17.994 --> 26:21.163
pointing his gun
at the commander.

26:22.290 --> 26:27.670
And I was pointing my AR-15
at fucking Chapo Guzman,

26:27.753 --> 26:29.839
I had him on his knees,

26:29.922 --> 26:32.300
ready to put
the handcuffs on him.

26:32.383 --> 26:36.554
El Chapo's shirt was stained
with blood,

26:36.637 --> 26:40.766
he had blood stains on his face

26:40.850 --> 26:42.101
and his hair.

26:45.229 --> 26:47.898
But then we got a call
on the walkie-talkie,

26:47.982 --> 26:53.654
by the police radio, ordering us
to leave it alone,

26:53.738 --> 26:55.072
and make no arrests.

26:55.865 --> 26:58.326
And then my boss yelled at me,

26:58.409 --> 27:02.121
my supervisor, Mr. Lira,

27:02.204 --> 27:07.376
"Leave him and go."

27:07.460 --> 27:09.462
I said, "How can I
let him go, bastard,

27:09.545 --> 27:11.213
aren't you seeing what he did?

27:11.297 --> 27:12.465
He dismembered
that poor bastard."

27:13.799 --> 27:16.218
That's where that story ended,

27:16.302 --> 27:19.263
because we were ordered
not to investigate,

27:19.347 --> 27:21.265
we were told to abandon it.

27:21.349 --> 27:23.642
We didn't even file a report.

27:24.226 --> 27:26.937
That was the first time
I had to release "El Chapo."

27:27.021 --> 27:28.606
I had to eat my own balls!

27:28.689 --> 27:30.274
Me as a state police officer.

27:34.070 --> 27:35.780
What was left of the corpse

27:35.863 --> 27:38.991
wasn't even
taken to the morgue,

27:39.617 --> 27:42.536
they went to throw it,

27:44.246 --> 27:48.000
where they had their
clandestine graveyard,

27:48.084 --> 27:52.046
which was located
at the Primavera forest,

27:52.129 --> 27:54.965
near El Palomar.

27:57.635 --> 28:00.888
That was one of
the first cases I had

28:00.971 --> 28:02.640
where one feels

28:02.723 --> 28:05.893
a terrible, unspeakable thing.

28:05.976 --> 28:09.897
I'd never seen a person
dismembered like that.

28:09.980 --> 28:13.275
I've never been able to erase
that image from my mind,

28:13.359 --> 28:15.152
nor will I ever.

28:38.509 --> 28:40.094
BERRELLEZ:
When I was transferred

28:40.177 --> 28:44.098
to LA for the first time,
in 1982, LA was a hotbed.

28:47.685 --> 28:50.104
You had the Colombians
doing all the big cocaine,

28:50.187 --> 28:53.732
the Mexicans bringing in the
marijuana and the heroin.

28:53.816 --> 28:55.317
And there was so much
dope that I thought,

28:55.401 --> 28:56.986
I'm going to be able
to make some

28:57.069 --> 28:59.530

the era of rock and roll

29:08.747 --> 29:10.708
in law enforcement, where
they would give us money,

29:10.791 --> 29:12.626

being somebody's bodyguard.

Also, when you have

29:30.895 --> 29:32.354
you ask him, how do
these guys dress?

BERRELLEZ: Manny was my
undercover Chicago character.

29:41.071 --> 29:45.534
He dressed real cowboy-ish,
cowboy hat, long hair,

29:45.618 --> 29:50.498
always in designer jeans,
exotic boots, the flashy belts.

29:50.581 --> 29:52.750
Manny would get out
of control sometimes.

29:52.833 --> 29:54.543
I mean, he'd take
no shit from nobody.

29:54.627 --> 29:56.837

INTERVIEWER: How often does
the line get blurry then?

30:05.930 --> 30:07.723
BERRELLEZ:
It got blurry at times

30:07.806 --> 30:10.100
when you forgot who you were.

30:10.184 --> 30:11.810
Because a lot of time, when
you're running with these guys,

30:11.894 --> 30:13.020
you forget you're a cop.

30:13.103 --> 30:14.647
You're having a great time.

30:14.730 --> 30:16.398
I actually got to like
some of these crooks

30:16.482 --> 30:17.900
more than I liked
some of the guys

30:17.983 --> 30:19.026
that I worked with, seriously.

30:24.573 --> 30:28.285
I remember, one time,
they sent me to Riverside.

30:28.369 --> 30:31.997
And they tell me they
have a heroin case going.

30:32.081 --> 30:34.583
As soon as I walked into
the apartment, on the coffee

30:34.667 --> 30:36.210
table is a kilo of heroin.

30:38.504 --> 30:40.339
These guys are sicarios, man.

30:40.422 --> 30:41.966
I mean, I could tell
just by looking at them,

30:42.049 --> 30:43.759
they're bad guys.

30:43.842 --> 30:45.594
And when you're alone
with these guys,

30:45.678 --> 30:48.430
and you can see they're
standing there with weapons,

30:48.514 --> 30:50.182
you become very fearful.

30:50.266 --> 30:53.561
But at the same time, you
have to not lose control.

30:53.644 --> 30:55.479
You have to show them
you're still the boss.

30:55.563 --> 30:57.106
You're still in control.
You've got the money.

30:57.189 --> 30:59.233
You're calling the shots.

30:59.316 --> 31:01.151
So they said, "Well, you're
the main guy, right?"

31:01.235 --> 31:02.778
And I go, "Yep."

31:02.861 --> 31:04.363
He says, there's your
heroin, right there.

31:04.446 --> 31:06.115
I said OK, so I
started getting it.

31:06.198 --> 31:08.409
He says, "No, no, no.
Where's the money?"

31:08.492 --> 31:11.579
I says, "It's in the car.
We'll walk down, and I'll
give you the money."

31:11.662 --> 31:13.205
They said, "No, we're not
going to do it like that.

31:13.289 --> 31:14.957
"You bring the money up here.

31:15.040 --> 31:16.875
We'll make the exchange
here in the apartment."

31:16.959 --> 31:17.918
And I said, "Nope.

31:18.002 --> 31:20.713
"I'm not going for that.

31:20.796 --> 31:22.298
"Just because the
heroin's here doesn't

31:22.381 --> 31:24.174
mean I have to trust you guys."

31:24.258 --> 31:26.218
"I come in here with $250,000,"

31:26.302 --> 31:29.138
I says, "you kill me, you cut
me up in little pieces, and you

31:29.221 --> 31:31.807
"take the pieces of my flesh,
and you feed it to the pigs
down in Sinaloa."

31:31.890 --> 31:34.101
I said, "No way, man.
We're not going to do that.

31:34.184 --> 31:35.603
"You're going to
have to come down,

31:35.686 --> 31:37.229
and we'll do the
exchange in the alley."

31:38.397 --> 31:40.983
So he tells me,
"No fucking way.

31:41.066 --> 31:42.985
Either we do it here,
or we don't have a deal."

31:43.068 --> 31:45.487
"No way, forget about it.

31:45.571 --> 31:48.490
"I don't give a shit
how you want to do it.

31:48.574 --> 31:50.492
"We do it my way,
or we don't do shit.

31:50.576 --> 31:54.079
"If you wanna be old ladies
with your little skirts...

31:54.163 --> 31:56.081
"...and don't want to come
out here and be scared,

31:56.165 --> 31:57.207
"that's your problem.

31:57.291 --> 31:59.585
I'm ready to do business."

31:59.668 --> 32:01.045
So I walked out.

32:04.214 --> 32:06.300
Two minutes later,
here they come

32:06.383 --> 32:09.595
with the heroin
in a gym bag.

32:09.678 --> 32:12.181
The guy says,
"Here's the heroin."

32:12.264 --> 32:14.266
And we're standing
there, and here comes

32:14.350 --> 32:17.061
the cavalry
to make the arrest.

32:17.144 --> 32:21.023
And the drug dealer goes,
"Manny, .

32:21.106 --> 32:23.150
It's the dogs."
It means the cops.

32:23.233 --> 32:25.110
And he pulls out his gun.

32:25.194 --> 32:27.154
And I have
my hands occupied,

32:27.237 --> 32:28.947
and I see he's going to shoot
at one of my surveillance guys.

32:29.031 --> 32:31.158
So I dumped the heroin on
the ground, and I push him.

32:31.241 --> 32:33.202
I pushed his arm, and the
gun goes up in the air.

32:33.285 --> 32:35.162
I just pulled out
my gun, like this,

32:35.245 --> 32:37.414
and I go, bam, bam, bam, bam,
bam, a whole bunch of times.

32:37.498 --> 32:40.709
And he falls back on
one knee, and he's

32:40.793 --> 32:42.586
still got the gun in his hand.

32:42.670 --> 32:44.088
And I shoot him more
times, bam, bam, bam,

32:44.171 --> 32:46.215
and then he finally falls.

32:46.298 --> 32:48.300
And he looks up to me,
and he says,

32:48.759 --> 32:51.929
"Manny, forgive me, please.

32:52.012 --> 32:53.305
Forgive me."

32:54.014 --> 32:56.100
And I felt so sorry for him,
and then his eyes rolled back,

32:56.183 --> 32:57.685
and you can see
that glazed look.

32:57.768 --> 32:58.852
He died.

33:01.480 --> 33:05.275
I thought, wow, I wonder if he
still thought that I was Manny,

33:05.359 --> 33:08.612
or if he knew I was a DEA
guy, and that I shot him.

33:08.696 --> 33:10.531
And he was just saying
he was sorry because he

33:10.614 --> 33:11.990
knew he was going to die.

33:12.074 --> 33:13.784
It still bothers me
to this day.

33:13.867 --> 33:15.744
It bothers me a lot.

33:15.828 --> 33:18.038
Because I always
wondered, should I

33:18.122 --> 33:22.042
have waited a little longer
before I pulled the trigger?

33:22.126 --> 33:23.794
How's God looking at me?

33:23.877 --> 33:28.257
Yeah, under men's law,
I did what I had to do,

33:28.340 --> 33:30.217
but how is God looking at me?

33:30.300 --> 33:32.136
Sometimes, I couldn't sleep.

33:34.346 --> 33:36.265
You start questioning yourself.

33:36.348 --> 33:38.350
But at the same, you have to
put this facade, this macho.

33:38.434 --> 33:39.935
It's like, yeah,
man, I shot him.

33:40.018 --> 33:42.062
He's dead. I'm glad
he's dead. Fuck the guy.

33:42.146 --> 33:44.022
You know,
you're talking like that,
even though you don't mean it.

33:44.106 --> 33:46.316
Because everybody is patting
your back and putting tequila

33:46.400 --> 33:48.026
drinks in front of you.

33:48.110 --> 33:50.362
And usually, you drink
all night, and you party,

33:50.446 --> 33:52.239
and that's the
only way you can go to sleep.

33:52.322 --> 33:53.949
That's the way
you cope with it,

33:54.032 --> 33:55.868
and of course, you try
to act like, yeah, man,

33:55.951 --> 33:57.828
I shot him like
10 times dude, you know?

33:57.911 --> 33:59.913
Yeah, it was cool,
but it's all fake.

34:24.313 --> 34:27.733
Around the year of 1983,

34:28.567 --> 34:31.069
one of our commanders

34:31.153 --> 34:36.575
asked if I could provide
protection at a party.

34:37.868 --> 34:40.496
Upon arriving at the place,
it was the...

34:40.579 --> 34:42.372
Aurora Ranch.

34:42.456 --> 34:48.045
There were many armed people
and among them,

34:48.128 --> 34:52.758
the commander introduced me to

34:52.841 --> 34:56.345
Ernesto Rafael Fonseca Carrillo.

34:58.430 --> 35:00.098
INTERVIEWER: And what did you
know about him?

35:00.182 --> 35:01.642
Naturally, I knew he was...

35:01.725 --> 35:03.393
that he was a Narco.

35:03.477 --> 35:06.021
Everyone knew
who the Narcos were.

35:09.566 --> 35:11.652
On another occasion,

35:11.735 --> 35:15.447
the commander asked me

35:15.531 --> 35:19.743
to handle an errand with him.

35:19.827 --> 35:24.331
I was surprised
when he took me directly

35:24.414 --> 35:26.667
to meet with the Narco

35:26.750 --> 35:28.293
Rafael Caro Quintero,

35:30.629 --> 35:35.008
for whom I began
body guarding loads.

35:35.092 --> 35:39.388
Usually they were 18-wheelers
full of drugs.

35:55.195 --> 35:57.739
It happened at
the Lebanese Club.

36:00.534 --> 36:02.953
I started seeing
some of the people

36:03.036 --> 36:06.748
from the DFS,
from the Mexican feds,

36:06.832 --> 36:10.460
from the military police,

36:10.544 --> 36:13.505
from the Jalisco State Police,

36:13.589 --> 36:17.175
-from the 15th military zone...
-INTERVIEWER: Who else?

36:17.259 --> 36:21.597
Rafael Caro Quintero, Ernesto
Fonseca Carrillo.

36:21.680 --> 36:24.349
They were all introduced to me,
right there.

36:24.433 --> 36:27.352
"This is Rafael Caro Quintero.

36:29.563 --> 36:31.231
Don Ernesto,

36:31.315 --> 36:35.152
here is the young man
you wanted to meet.

36:35.235 --> 36:40.407
Jorge Godoy, this is Mr. Ernesto
Fonseca Carrillo.

36:40.490 --> 36:43.619
They work for
the Interior Secretary.

36:43.702 --> 36:46.997
You will be under their command,

36:47.080 --> 36:49.333
do whatever they say.

36:49.416 --> 36:53.587
You will be in armored vehicles,

36:53.670 --> 36:57.257
Grand Marquis.
You will be with them.

36:57.341 --> 37:01.595
You will have to show
your state police ID...

37:01.678 --> 37:05.641
so they can pass
the checkpoints...

37:05.724 --> 37:09.645
any checkpoint, police,
military, etc.

37:09.728 --> 37:11.813
And you will be with him...

37:11.897 --> 37:14.066
And you are responsible
for Fonseca...

37:14.149 --> 37:17.027
and you can't
leave him unguarded."

37:21.865 --> 37:23.367
There was a commander.

37:24.242 --> 37:26.036
And we got along very well.

37:26.119 --> 37:28.455
He asked me one day,

37:28.538 --> 37:30.165
"Do you want to work as a driver

37:30.248 --> 37:32.793
for a federal commander?"

37:32.876 --> 37:34.711
I said, "Yes."

37:36.171 --> 37:37.255
He said, "OK."

37:38.465 --> 37:40.968
He introduced me to
Ernesto Fonseca.

37:46.306 --> 37:48.266
When I arrived to meet
Ernesto Fonseca,

37:48.350 --> 37:49.768
he was introduced to me

37:49.851 --> 37:51.895
as a commander
of the federal police.

37:55.148 --> 37:56.191
OK.

37:56.274 --> 37:58.026
Well, he's a commander, right?

37:59.236 --> 38:01.279
Ernesto and I started talking.

38:01.613 --> 38:04.032
He told me,
"You'll be fine here."

38:04.116 --> 38:05.867
"Here...
with me you'll be fine."

38:05.951 --> 38:08.286
"Oh, thank you," I said.

38:09.413 --> 38:10.956
After like a month...

38:11.039 --> 38:15.669
I was seeing everything
that was going on,

38:15.752 --> 38:17.629
what was happening there,

38:17.713 --> 38:23.093
but I didn't dare to ask.

38:23.176 --> 38:25.387
Then I saw...

38:25.470 --> 38:26.596
Godoy.

38:28.140 --> 38:30.517
Jorge Godoy was there.

38:31.727 --> 38:33.979
I asked him,
"What are you doing here?"

38:34.062 --> 38:36.690
He said,
"No, what are you doing here?"

38:36.773 --> 38:39.651
I said, "Well, I'm here
with the commander."

38:39.735 --> 38:41.945
He says, "Oh, sure, me too."

38:42.029 --> 38:44.406
Then Godoy told me...

38:44.489 --> 38:48.326
"No, you crazy fucker,
we aren't with a commander...

38:51.580 --> 38:54.624
He's a narcotics trafficker.

38:55.876 --> 38:57.836
And tomorrow we'll have a party

38:57.919 --> 39:00.714
where you'll meet everyone."

39:03.717 --> 39:06.470
Well, I was..

39:06.553 --> 39:08.221
I started feeling bad, right?

39:10.265 --> 39:14.728
The next day, they had
the party, a birthday party.

39:14.811 --> 39:17.606
Well, Felix Gallardo arrived.

39:17.689 --> 39:19.024
Caro Quintero arrived.

39:19.107 --> 39:21.610
I mean, everyone,
all the big names.

39:23.945 --> 39:25.822
That's when I met everyone.

39:30.702 --> 39:33.413
And that's how I started...

39:33.497 --> 39:38.085
my career as a bodyguard
for the Narcos.

39:56.353 --> 39:58.647
PHIL JORDAN: Kiki picked
me up for lunch one day.

39:58.730 --> 40:02.109
The whole time Kiki
and I were together,

40:02.192 --> 40:04.945
we were always
under surveillance

40:05.028 --> 40:08.323
by three or four guys.

40:10.951 --> 40:14.955
And I said, Kiki, I mean,
there's three guys over there.

40:15.038 --> 40:18.083
You can see their 45's.

40:18.166 --> 40:19.584
What the hell is going on, man?

40:19.668 --> 40:21.545
I mean, do I have to be careful?

40:21.628 --> 40:23.088
He says, don't worry about it.

40:23.171 --> 40:26.967
They're DFS, and they
work for the CIA.

40:27.050 --> 40:28.718
I said, OK.

40:45.318 --> 40:48.446
DFS, very selective
in its recruitment.

40:48.530 --> 40:51.241
The creme de la creme got
into that organization.

40:51.324 --> 40:53.994
But once you became
a DFS agent,

40:54.077 --> 40:56.288
you were issued a credential,

40:56.371 --> 41:02.335
and that credential let you
in anywhere and everywhere.

41:02.419 --> 41:04.212
It was a powerful tool.

41:04.296 --> 41:07.632
Several bad guys had
these DFS credentials,

41:07.716 --> 41:09.676
including two of the
individuals who ran

41:09.759 --> 41:11.303
the Guadalajara drug cartel--

41:11.386 --> 41:15.599
Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo
and Rafael Caro Quintero.

41:17.309 --> 41:19.811
There was no line of
distinction anymore

41:19.895 --> 41:23.398
between bad guys and the DFS.

41:23.481 --> 41:26.067
They were all the same thing.

41:26.151 --> 41:29.404
This is what Kiki Camarena
had to face every day.

41:33.158 --> 41:36.870
MIKA: It was very,
very difficult at the end.

41:36.953 --> 41:40.916
I just had to learn to deal
with it, as best as I could.

41:40.999 --> 41:44.336
Finally, I convinced Kiki
it's time for us to leave.

41:49.257 --> 41:52.385
When Kiki got his
orders to San Diego,

41:52.469 --> 41:54.429
he had a big, old
smile on his face.

41:54.512 --> 41:57.015
He was so happy.

41:57.098 --> 42:00.977
I hadn't seen him that
happy in a long time.

42:01.061 --> 42:03.104
I wasn't smiling.

42:05.523 --> 42:07.609
I was done.

42:07.692 --> 42:11.112
I wasn't going to
smile until we left.

42:11.196 --> 42:12.614
INTERVIEWER: When
were you due to leave?

42:12.697 --> 42:14.741
Two weeks after
they kidnapped him.

42:14.824 --> 42:17.077
INTERVIEWER: You were supposed
to leave two weeks later?

42:17.160 --> 42:18.787
Two weeks after
they kidnapped him.

42:21.081 --> 42:23.041
REPORTER 1: New worrisome
developments tonight in

42:23.124 --> 42:25.252
the United States'
war on drugs.

42:25.335 --> 42:28.255
REPORTER 2: The US government
is offering a $50,000 reward

42:28.338 --> 42:30.507
for information
about the kidnapping

42:30.590 --> 42:33.468
of an agent of the Drug
Enforcement Administration.

42:33.551 --> 42:35.971
Enrique Camarena
was reportedly kidnapped

42:36.054 --> 42:38.139
by four armed men
in Guadalajara, Mexico.

42:38.223 --> 42:40.100
JACK LAWN: Eyewitness
accounts indicated

42:40.183 --> 42:43.228
he was abducted by four
individuals, placed

42:43.311 --> 42:44.980
forcibly in the
back of a vehicle,

42:45.063 --> 42:46.731
and the vehicle fled the scene.

42:53.280 --> 42:55.699
BERRELLEZ: I remember
being at a gym like 4:00, 4:30,

42:55.782 --> 42:58.994
5:00 in the morning, working
out, when all of a sudden,

42:59.077 --> 43:01.162
news comes on the screen.

43:01.246 --> 43:03.790
I remember, I was running on
a treadmill, and I stopped.

43:03.873 --> 43:07.711
I said, "Oh my God,
they've got Kiki."

43:07.794 --> 43:10.630
In my heart, having
worked in Mexico,

43:10.714 --> 43:12.716
I knew that
the traffickers alone

43:12.799 --> 43:15.427
wouldn't do
something like that.

43:15.510 --> 43:18.763
The traffickers do not do
anything without the protection

43:18.847 --> 43:21.391
of the Mexican government.

43:21.474 --> 43:25.520
I knew in my heart
that if the drug lords

43:25.603 --> 43:27.397
ordered Kiki
picked up,

43:27.480 --> 43:29.107
they weren't going to
do it themselves.

43:29.190 --> 43:31.735
They were going to use
dirty cops to do it.

43:36.990 --> 43:39.534
It was a Volkswagen Atlantic,

43:40.201 --> 43:42.454
a small car.

43:42.537 --> 43:43.455
And it was...

43:43.538 --> 43:44.914
Samuel,

43:44.998 --> 43:46.833
Torres Lepe,

43:46.916 --> 43:48.126
Rene Verdugo

43:48.209 --> 43:50.420
and me.

43:51.421 --> 43:54.632
When Kiki comes out of
the consulate,

43:54.716 --> 43:58.470
Rene Verdugo says,
"That's him."

43:58.553 --> 43:59.971
Samuel gets out of the car

44:00.055 --> 44:01.848
and tells me,
"Rene, come with me."

44:02.807 --> 44:06.353
Samuel had him
on the right side.

44:07.479 --> 44:11.149
He grabbed him by the right arm
and I by the left arm.

44:12.942 --> 44:16.738
Then Samuel took out his gun
and put it here.

44:16.821 --> 44:20.617
He told him, "Don't resist,
or I'll finish you right here."

44:22.369 --> 44:24.829
"Alright," Kiki said.

44:24.913 --> 44:27.874
He walked, he was calm.

44:29.209 --> 44:34.589
I didn't feel like
he was afraid.

44:34.672 --> 44:36.091
INTERVIEWER: And did you know

44:36.174 --> 44:37.926
that he was going to die?
