WEBVTT

01:47:22.741 --> 01:47:25.176
<i>Casey: With a month of
big-league baseball behind us,</i>

01:47:25.244 --> 01:47:27.338
-- <i>it's time for what, Dan?
Dan: Predictions.</i>

01:47:27.413 --> 01:47:29.711
<i>It's time for predictions.
Last year Dan predicted</i>

01:47:29.782 --> 01:47:31.511
<i>that the Yankees
would finish third</i>

01:47:31.584 --> 01:47:33.609
in the American League East.
Where'd they finish, Dan?

01:47:33.686 --> 01:47:35.848
-- They won the World Series.
-- They won the World Series.

01:47:35.921 --> 01:47:37.411
What do you got
for us this year?

01:47:37.489 --> 01:47:39.014
The team of Lord Baltimore,
Casey.

01:47:39.091 --> 01:47:40.786
The Orioles will beat
the American League

01:47:40.859 --> 01:47:42.088
like an old Persian rug.

01:47:42.161 --> 01:47:44.323
Then they'll go on to teach
Ken Griffey's Cincinnati Reds

01:47:44.396 --> 01:47:45.591
a little lesson in humility.

01:47:45.664 --> 01:47:47.530
Dan says the Orioles,
I say the Yankees.

01:47:47.600 --> 01:47:49.227
Dan says the Reds,
I say the Mets.

01:47:49.301 --> 01:47:51.599
But, kids, whether you're
a Mets fan, a Yankee fan,

01:47:51.670 --> 01:47:53.229
a Dodger fan,
or a Red Sox fan,

01:47:53.305 --> 01:47:55.637
the one thing we can all
agree on is what, Danny?

01:47:55.708 --> 01:47:57.142
John Rocker's a dufus.

01:47:57.209 --> 01:48:00.770
John Rooker's a big honkin' dufus.
That's all for us.

01:48:00.846 --> 01:48:03.144
We'll be back tomorrow night
with more scores and highlights.

01:48:03.215 --> 01:48:06.014
This is day six of the
Continental Corp fire sale,

01:48:06.085 --> 01:48:08.850
so if you've got
$14 or $15 billion

01:48:08.921 --> 01:48:11.185
in your passbook account,
you can own this network.

01:48:11.256 --> 01:48:13.224
You've been watching
"Sports Night" on CSC.

01:48:13.292 --> 01:48:14.657
Have a good night.

01:48:14.727 --> 01:48:15.888
Good night, Mom.

01:48:16.929 --> 01:48:18.363
<i>Dave: We're out.
Natalie: Good show.</i>

01:48:18.430 --> 01:48:19.920
Who wrote the Rocker joke?

01:48:19.999 --> 01:48:21.023
-- <i>L</i> did.
-- <i>I</i> did.

01:48:21.100 --> 01:48:23.535
-- <i>L</i> did.
-- <i>I</i> did.

01:48:23.602 --> 01:48:25.536
You suggested the Rocker joke.
I refined it.

01:48:25.604 --> 01:48:26.696
You typed it.

01:48:27.673 --> 01:48:30.005
Please unhook yourselves and
come and see me in the bullpen.

01:48:30.075 --> 01:48:31.941
-- Dana, I gave them the Rocker joke.
-- Jeremy.

01:48:32.011 --> 01:48:33.638
-- <i>I</i> gave them the Rocker joke.
-- Natalie.

01:48:33.712 --> 01:48:36.181
You said, "Let's do a joke
about John Rocker."

01:48:36.248 --> 01:48:37.181
That's right.

01:48:37.249 --> 01:48:39.115
That's not writing the joke,
that's suggesting the joke.

01:48:39.184 --> 01:48:41.346
Both of you,
come with me, please.

01:48:41.420 --> 01:48:43.252
<i>Natalie: I did several
drafts of the joke.</i>

01:48:43.322 --> 01:48:45.120
You said, "Let's give out
his home number."

01:48:45.190 --> 01:48:47.215
I said, "We can't give out
his home number on TV.

01:48:47.292 --> 01:48:48.521
Let's call him a dufus."

01:48:48.594 --> 01:48:50.187
Then we disagreed
on the spelling of "dufus."

01:48:50.262 --> 01:48:52.026
And then I agreed, yes,
we should call him a dufus.

01:48:52.097 --> 01:48:53.292
And I added
"big honkin' dufus."

01:48:53.365 --> 01:48:54.298
And then Casey typed it.

01:48:54.366 --> 01:48:55.458
It was a good
team effort, Dana.

01:48:55.534 --> 01:48:57.400
You're all idiots.

01:48:57.469 --> 01:49:00.063
The Atlanta Braves
are owned by Time Warner.

01:49:00.139 --> 01:49:02.073
AOL Time Warner
is a major player

01:49:02.141 --> 01:49:04.075
in the bidding war
for Continental Corp.

01:49:04.143 --> 01:49:05.577
Let's not piss off people

01:49:05.644 --> 01:49:08.079
while they're looking at us
through the store window.

01:49:08.147 --> 01:49:09.911
We are on life support now.

01:49:09.982 --> 01:49:12.917
We are way past the
"show business is funny" stage.

01:49:12.985 --> 01:49:15.647
It was sophomoric,
and it was stupid.

01:49:16.922 --> 01:49:18.083
It was Jeremy's idea.

01:49:18.157 --> 01:49:20.023
-- It was your idea.
-- I was goaded by Danny.

01:49:20.092 --> 01:49:22.288
-- I was practically threatened by Casey.
-- All I did was type it.

01:49:22.361 --> 01:49:24.762
VVell, then, the buck pretty much
stops with you, there, doesn't it?

01:49:24.830 --> 01:49:25.626
Shut up.

01:49:26.799 --> 01:49:27.857
I'm going to Anthony's.

01:49:27.933 --> 01:49:29.332
-- Let's go someplace different.
-- Why?

01:49:29.401 --> 01:49:31.130
'Cause we've been to Anthony's
the last six nights.

01:49:31.203 --> 01:49:33.262
-- VVhich is why we should keep going.
-- Dana's right.

01:49:33.338 --> 01:49:34.635
-- About what?
-- Everything.

01:49:34.707 --> 01:49:36.698
-- Suck-up. -- A little
thing oaHedluck,Danny.

01:49:36.775 --> 01:49:38.038
-- Luck?
-- The power of luck.

01:49:38.110 --> 01:49:40.101
We've gone to Anthony's
six nights in a row.

01:49:40.179 --> 01:49:41.510
You don't break the luck.

01:49:41.580 --> 01:49:43.378
-- Continental Corp's up for sale.
-- That's right.

01:49:43.449 --> 01:49:45.577
-- We could all be out of work
in a few days. -- That's right.

01:49:45.651 --> 01:49:46.914
Don't we <i>want</i>
to change our luck?

01:49:46.985 --> 01:49:47.952
-- Dana?
-- No.

01:49:48.020 --> 01:49:49.385
-- No. You know why?
-- Why?

01:49:49.455 --> 01:49:51.719
-- Dana? -- 'Cause people
are bidding on us.

01:49:51.790 --> 01:49:53.383
They're
in rooms right now,

01:49:53.459 --> 01:49:55.257
they're on cellphones,
they're crunching numbers.

01:49:55.327 --> 01:49:57.352
Something good is coming,
and you don't change the luck.

01:49:57.429 --> 01:49:58.794
-- You don't change the luck, Jeremy.
-- Okay.

01:49:58.864 --> 01:50:00.992
Anthony's!
I'll meet you there.

01:50:01.066 --> 01:50:02.056
-- Dana...
-- Yeah?

01:50:02.134 --> 01:50:03.863
Sorry about the Rocker joke.
That was me.

01:50:03.936 --> 01:50:05.665
You should've given out
his home number.

01:50:05.738 --> 01:50:07.399
-- Can't say it on TV.
-- Tell me about it.

01:50:15.047 --> 01:50:16.674
It's not gonna be
Time Warner.

01:50:16.749 --> 01:50:18.239
Ah, it could be
Time Warner.

01:50:18.317 --> 01:50:20.411
Well, if it's Time Warner,
we're screwed.

01:50:20.486 --> 01:50:23.319
If it's Fox, we're screwed.
If it's Disney, we're screwed.

01:50:23.388 --> 01:50:24.514
-- Look...
-- Dana.

01:50:24.590 --> 01:50:27.082
Just 'cause CNN
already has cable sports

01:50:27.159 --> 01:50:29.992
and Fox already has
cable sports and Disney --

01:50:30.062 --> 01:50:31.052
Already has ESPN...

01:50:31.130 --> 01:50:32.825
ESPN 2, ESPN news,

01:50:32.898 --> 01:50:35.595
ESPN radio, <i>ESPN</i> the magazine,
ESPN the restaurant.

01:50:35.667 --> 01:50:36.964
See, when you put it
that way --

01:50:37.035 --> 01:50:38.503
These guys need
another sports channel

01:50:38.570 --> 01:50:39.901
like they need
a hole in the head.

01:50:39.972 --> 01:50:41.531
-- Someone's gonna come along.
-- Yeah? VVho?

01:50:41.607 --> 01:50:42.972
You got to allow
for the possibility

01:50:43.041 --> 01:50:45.203
that there's someone out there
that needs a hole in the head.

01:50:45.277 --> 01:50:47.678
Yes, but in the meantime,
Time Warner, Disney, and Fox

01:50:47.746 --> 01:50:48.804
are the only bidders,

01:50:48.881 --> 01:50:50.747
and the first thing
any of them will do

01:50:50.816 --> 01:50:52.341
is sell off CSC for parts.

01:50:52.417 --> 01:50:54.044
-- And <i>yet,</i> here we are at Anthony's.
-- What's your point?

01:50:54.119 --> 01:50:56.281
My point is that this is the
kind of luck you want to break.

01:50:56.355 --> 01:50:57.720
We should be someplace else
right now.

01:50:57.790 --> 01:50:59.952
-- No, that's not the point.
-- What <i>is</i> the point?

01:51:00.025 --> 01:51:01.550
Dana?

01:51:01.627 --> 01:51:03.721
Those are the only people
bidding right now.

01:51:03.796 --> 01:51:05.161
-- <i>That's</i> the point.
-- Ah.

01:51:05.230 --> 01:51:06.891
-- Aren't I adorable?
-- Yes.

01:51:06.965 --> 01:51:08.490
-- <i>So...
Elliot." Yes.</i>

01:51:08.567 --> 01:51:10.501
-- Desperate times.
-- Yes.

01:51:10.569 --> 01:51:13.129
You know,
in times like these,

01:51:13.205 --> 01:51:15.003
the last days of a war,

01:51:15.073 --> 01:51:18.043
the last days
before going off to war,

01:51:18.110 --> 01:51:19.373
you know what people do?

01:51:19.444 --> 01:51:20.741
They band together?

01:51:20.813 --> 01:51:23.009
-- They sleep with each other.
-- Really?

01:51:23.081 --> 01:51:24.981
The last days
on a movie shoot...

01:51:25.050 --> 01:51:26.074
-- The last days of school.
-- The last days --

01:51:26.151 --> 01:51:27.209
They sleep with each other?

01:51:27.286 --> 01:51:28.481
They do.

01:51:28.554 --> 01:51:29.453
It's not that I'm not
flattered, Dan --

01:51:29.521 --> 01:51:31.285
I understand.
What about you?

01:51:31.356 --> 01:51:33.950
Danny, only you would take
an occasion like this

01:51:34.026 --> 01:51:35.551
and turn it into
an opportunity for sex.

01:51:35.627 --> 01:51:38.221
I'm gifted, yes, but that's
actually not why I came over.

01:51:38.297 --> 01:51:39.492
Why'd you come over?

01:51:39.565 --> 01:51:41.556
-- To tell you you're the best
secretary I've ever had. -- Thank you.

01:51:41.633 --> 01:51:43.032
-- I mean it.
-- I know you do.

01:51:43.101 --> 01:51:45.069
-- That's why it's hard for
me to tell you this. -- What?

01:51:45.137 --> 01:51:47.834
-- I'm not your secretary.
-- What do you mean?

01:51:47.906 --> 01:51:51.672
-- I'm not your secretary.
-- When did that happen?

01:51:51.743 --> 01:51:54.110
It didn't happen, Danny.
I've never been your secretary.

01:51:54.179 --> 01:51:57.513
-- I thought you were my secretary.
-- Yes, I know.

01:51:57.583 --> 01:51:59.608
I've always treated you
like my secretary.

01:51:59.685 --> 01:52:01.779
Yes, I know.

01:52:01.854 --> 01:52:02.787
Okay.

01:52:02.855 --> 01:52:04.118
Well, my mistake.

01:52:04.189 --> 01:52:05.953
Yes.

01:52:06.024 --> 01:52:07.116
All right.

01:52:07.192 --> 01:52:10.025
I'm gonna go talk to Casey.

01:52:12.197 --> 01:52:13.221
It's for my boyfriend.

01:52:13.298 --> 01:52:14.766
Well,
I'm sorry to hear that.

01:52:14.833 --> 01:52:16.358
Hey, what's going on
here, huh?

01:52:16.435 --> 01:52:17.493
It's for her boyfriend.

01:52:17.569 --> 01:52:18.536
-- What's his name?
-- Joe.

01:52:18.604 --> 01:52:19.833
I don't like
the sound of him.

01:52:19.905 --> 01:52:21.839
I think you should dump him
and go outwith Casey.

01:52:21.907 --> 01:52:23.136
This is Dan.

01:52:23.208 --> 01:52:25.176
Will you sign it, too?

01:52:25.244 --> 01:52:27.576
Sure, but I'm gonna sign it,
"Joe, I think you should

01:52:27.646 --> 01:52:29.546
dump this redhead
and go outwith Casey."

01:52:29.615 --> 01:52:32.346
-- How did I end up with Joe? --
Things work out that way sometimes.

01:52:32.417 --> 01:52:35.079
-- You guys are so cute.
- But me more than him, right?

01:52:35.153 --> 01:52:36.746
-- Well, I don't --
-- It's okay. Thank you.

01:52:36.822 --> 01:52:38.415
Thanks.

01:52:41.426 --> 01:52:44.418
-- So, listen...
-- Yeah.

01:52:44.496 --> 01:52:47.124
It's something we should
talk about at least, right?

01:52:47.199 --> 01:52:48.132
I don't know.

01:52:48.200 --> 01:52:49.497
-- Casey...
-- I don't know.

01:52:49.568 --> 01:52:51.332
Let me tell you something,
Casey.

01:52:51.403 --> 01:52:53.735
Iwouldn't mind
living in I.A.

01:52:53.805 --> 01:52:56.206
You know what you got
out there? Sunshine.

01:52:56.275 --> 01:52:59.267
You got sunshine,
you got the Pacific Ocean,

01:52:59.344 --> 01:53:02.177
you got driving around
with the top down.

01:53:02.247 --> 01:53:03.442
I'd have to buy a car.

01:53:03.515 --> 01:53:05.711
It's fun to buy a car.
You got the new-car smell.

01:53:05.784 --> 01:53:07.843
Plus, you got the sunshine,
the Pacific Ocean,

01:53:07.920 --> 01:53:09.718
not to mention
a pretty good job offer.

01:53:09.788 --> 01:53:12.348
It's not a pretty good
job offer.

01:53:12.424 --> 01:53:14.893
It's 11 :00, it's one, maybe one
and a half million more viewers,

01:53:14.960 --> 01:53:16.257
it's Dana
as executive producer.

01:53:16.328 --> 01:53:17.955
-- What more --
-- It's in California.

01:53:18.030 --> 01:53:19.361
Where they got Laker Girls.

01:53:19.431 --> 01:53:22.594
Same show, bigger audience,
sunshine, Pacific Ocean,

01:53:22.668 --> 01:53:25.365
new car, Laker Girls,
plus the I.A. Philharmonic

01:53:25.437 --> 01:53:27.531
with Mr. Esa-Pekka Salonen
at the podium.

01:53:27.606 --> 01:53:28.937
You know where he's from?

01:53:29.007 --> 01:53:31.101
-- Helsinki. -- That's right.
You know where that is?

01:53:31.176 --> 01:53:32.405
Finland.

01:53:32.477 --> 01:53:34.673
That's right.

01:53:36.748 --> 01:53:38.147
When you think about it,

01:53:38.216 --> 01:53:39.980
it's actually a better job
than the ones we got now,

01:53:40.052 --> 01:53:42.111
and the ones we got now we're
not gonna have that much longer,

01:53:42.187 --> 01:53:43.985
so it's a pretty good
job offer.

01:53:46.358 --> 01:53:49.851
Well, we'll just, uh...

01:53:49.928 --> 01:53:52.056
cross that bridge
when we do.

01:53:52.130 --> 01:53:54.758
-- Okay.
-- Good.

01:53:54.833 --> 01:53:55.766
-- Jeremy?
-- Yeah?

01:53:55.834 --> 01:53:57.268
I've had
a couple of drinks,

01:53:57.336 --> 01:53:59.532
so I think I have the courage
to tell you this.

01:53:59.604 --> 01:54:01.595
-- Jeremy... -- Hang on. Hang
on, I'm sitting right here.

01:54:01.673 --> 01:54:04.199
-- You can stay there. -- If you're gonna
tell him something that takes courage,

01:54:04.276 --> 01:54:05.573
<i>I think</i> I <i>shouldn't
be sitting here.</i>

01:54:05.644 --> 01:54:07.476
-- It's okay.
-- Okay.

01:54:07.546 --> 01:54:09.742
-- I'm still in love with you.
-- Oh, can I please get up?

01:54:09.815 --> 01:54:11.681
-- Natalie... -- No, you
don't have <i>to</i> say anything.

01:54:11.750 --> 01:54:13.479
In fact, you probably shouldn't.
Just let me talk.

01:54:13.552 --> 01:54:16.419
-- You really gotta let me out. --
No, I don't want to lose the moment.

01:54:16.488 --> 01:54:18.513
I'm sitting right here!

01:54:18.590 --> 01:54:20.080
<i>Jeremy,
there hasn't been a day</i>

01:54:20.158 --> 01:54:22.559
since I broke up with you that
I haven't wanted you back.

01:54:22.594 --> 01:54:23.823
I broke up with you.

01:54:23.895 --> 01:54:25.863
There have been
a couple of days.

01:54:25.931 --> 01:54:27.160
Which days?

01:54:27.232 --> 01:54:28.893
Um, I don't know
if this is me talking

01:54:28.967 --> 01:54:30.025
or the coconut pifia colada.

01:54:30.102 --> 01:54:31.570
Also, I've been having
these mood swings.

01:54:31.636 --> 01:54:33.126
Natalie --

01:54:33.205 --> 01:54:36.004
-- Come to think of it, I hate
your living guts. -- Okay.

01:54:36.074 --> 01:54:38.839
-- Desperate times.
Elliot." Yes.

01:54:38.910 --> 01:54:41.572
It's been said
that in times like these,

01:54:41.646 --> 01:54:44.445
the last days of war, the last
days before going off to war,

01:54:44.516 --> 01:54:46.348
<i>it's been said
that during these times,</i>

01:54:46.418 --> 01:54:48.580
people sleep together.

01:54:50.088 --> 01:54:52.079
[Laughs]
That's what it's been said

01:54:52.157 --> 01:54:55.422
-- that people do during times
[Clears throat] like these. -- Yeah.

01:54:55.494 --> 01:54:58.930
<i>If Jeremy wanted, he could
have me any time, anywhere.</i>

01:54:58.997 --> 01:55:00.396
I would do things
to his mind and body

01:55:00.465 --> 01:55:01.660
that I think
he'd really enjoy.

01:55:01.733 --> 01:55:03.326
God knows I would.

01:55:03.402 --> 01:55:04.733
-- Natalie...
-- Don't touch me.

01:55:04.803 --> 01:55:07.067
-- Okay. -- VVould you please,
for the love of God, let me out?

01:55:07.139 --> 01:55:08.072
Desperate times.

01:55:08.140 --> 01:55:09.437
Shut up.
Who wants what?

01:55:09.541 --> 01:55:10.508
<i>Dan: Beer. Casey: Beer.
Jeremy: Beer.</i>

01:55:10.575 --> 01:55:11.974
Coconut pifia colada.

01:55:12.044 --> 01:55:13.239
How am I supposed
to remember that?

01:55:13.311 --> 01:55:14.472
It's three beers
and a pifia colada.

01:55:14.546 --> 01:55:15.775
-- You want a mnemonic device?
-- Hey!

01:55:15.847 --> 01:55:16.939
Get him, Dana!

01:55:17.015 --> 01:55:19.575
Three beers
and a coconut pifia colada.

01:55:19.651 --> 01:55:22.552
<i>Dan: [ On TV 1 McNabb was 14 for
19 passing for a total of...</i>

01:55:22.587 --> 01:55:24.351
You want
another one of these?

01:55:24.423 --> 01:55:26.255
Yeah, if you don't mind.
Thanks.

01:55:26.324 --> 01:55:28.156
<i>This show is good,
don't you think?</i>

01:55:28.226 --> 01:55:29.751
-- "Sports Night."
-- Yeah.

01:55:29.828 --> 01:55:31.990
They work
just across the street.

01:55:32.064 --> 01:55:34.123
-- A lot of those guys come in here.
-- Yeah, I saw.

01:55:34.199 --> 01:55:35.462
Jack...

01:55:35.534 --> 01:55:37.229
And here's
the executive producer.

01:55:37.302 --> 01:55:38.827
-- How you doin'?
-- Hi.

01:55:38.904 --> 01:55:40.201
I was saying
it's a good show.

01:55:40.272 --> 01:55:41.831
Thank you.

01:55:41.907 --> 01:55:43.739
Jack, I'd like three beers
and a coconut pifia colada.

01:55:43.809 --> 01:55:45.299
I need to go in the back
one minute.

01:55:45.377 --> 01:55:49.814
I was just saying
that it's a good show,

01:55:49.881 --> 01:55:51.110
and the bartender
pointed out

01:55:51.183 --> 01:55:52.673
that a lot of your guys
come in here.

01:55:52.751 --> 01:55:54.219
I told him
I could see that.

01:55:54.286 --> 01:55:56.118
At first I thought
it was interesting

01:55:56.188 --> 01:55:58.054
that I was watching them
on television

01:55:58.123 --> 01:56:00.217
and they're also standing
right over there.

01:56:00.292 --> 01:56:01.657
We broadcast live at 11:00,

01:56:01.726 --> 01:56:03.455
and then we replay the show
at 1:00.

01:56:03.528 --> 01:56:04.552
It's called tape delay.

01:56:04.629 --> 01:56:06.028
I sussed out
the technology.

01:56:06.098 --> 01:56:07.566
I really just came up here

01:56:07.632 --> 01:56:09.498
to get some drinks
for my friends.

01:56:09.568 --> 01:56:11.468
I have no reason
not to believe you.

01:56:11.536 --> 01:56:13.334
I'm just saying I'm not
in a mood

01:56:13.405 --> 01:56:15.499
to be bought a drink
by a guy in a suit.

01:56:15.574 --> 01:56:16.871
I'm not wearing a suit.

01:56:16.942 --> 01:56:19.206
For that matter,
I wasn't offering you a drink.

01:56:19.277 --> 01:56:21.541
Yeah. You left your
Wall Street office at 8:30,

01:56:21.613 --> 01:56:23.581
went to your 2-bedroom
on the East Side,

01:56:23.648 --> 01:56:26.379
and changed into your "I don't
always wear a suit" clothes.

01:56:26.451 --> 01:56:28.010
I don't live
on the East Side.

01:56:28.086 --> 01:56:29.178
If you live
on the West Side,

01:56:29.254 --> 01:56:30.483
then you're stuck
back in college.

01:56:30.555 --> 01:56:31.818
I live in Paris.

01:56:31.890 --> 01:56:33.881
[Laughs]

01:56:33.959 --> 01:56:35.518
France?

01:56:35.594 --> 01:56:37.084
Yeah.

01:56:37.162 --> 01:56:39.358
Sometimes Seattle,
sometimes Chicago,

01:56:39.431 --> 01:56:41.627
sometimes Tokyo,
sometimes St. Barts.

01:56:41.700 --> 01:56:42.963
Tell me...

01:56:43.034 --> 01:56:44.433
Seriously, are there women

01:56:44.503 --> 01:56:46.267
who believe you
when you say that?

01:56:46.338 --> 01:56:47.601
Not many.

01:56:47.672 --> 01:56:50.073
So, Dana, I couldn't help

01:56:50.142 --> 01:56:52.133
overhearing you and
your friends a while ago.

01:56:52.210 --> 01:56:54.372
We're sitting on the other
side of the restaurant.

01:56:54.446 --> 01:56:55.607
Yeah.

01:56:55.680 --> 01:56:58.115
I wouldn't worry about
a Time Warner takeover.

01:57:03.989 --> 01:57:06.083
You wouldn't, huh?

01:57:06.158 --> 01:57:09.856
They'll kick out
when the stock hits 27.

01:57:09.928 --> 01:57:12.522
How did you know my name?

01:57:12.597 --> 01:57:14.497
The bartender said it.

01:57:14.566 --> 01:57:16.432
No, he didn't.

01:57:16.501 --> 01:57:17.593
Sure, he did.

01:57:17.669 --> 01:57:19.831
How else would I know it?

01:57:21.840 --> 01:57:24.639
Time Warner's gonna kick out
at 27 a share.

01:57:26.578 --> 01:57:28.046
All right, what was that
you needed?

01:57:28.113 --> 01:57:30.639
Dana?

01:57:30.715 --> 01:57:34.879
Three beers
and a coconut pifia colada.

01:57:43.094 --> 01:57:44.528
<i>Dana." Hi.</i>

01:57:44.596 --> 01:57:46.496
Hi.

01:57:46.565 --> 01:57:47.691
Any word?

01:57:47.766 --> 01:57:49.359
<i>Any word on what?</i>

01:57:49.434 --> 01:57:50.924
Our futures.

01:57:51.002 --> 01:57:53.164
If it's Fox, they'll
drop the cable interest.

01:57:53.238 --> 01:57:55.502
If it's Disney, they'll
drop the cable interest.

01:57:55.574 --> 01:57:57.975
<i>If it's Time Warner, they'll
drop the cable interest.</i>

01:57:58.043 --> 01:58:00.910
Yeah. I met a guy
last night at Anthony's --

01:58:00.979 --> 01:58:02.174
<i>Hi.</i>

01:58:02.247 --> 01:58:03.874
<i>" Hey, Danny.</i>
-- <i>Any word?</i>

01:58:03.949 --> 01:58:04.973
No.

01:58:05.050 --> 01:58:06.984
Did you know that Kim
isn't my secretary?

01:58:07.052 --> 01:58:08.144
Yeah.

01:58:08.220 --> 01:58:10.314
I have been treating her
like she was my secretary.

01:58:10.388 --> 01:58:12.220
Yes, I know.

01:58:12.290 --> 01:58:13.724
Okay, just so I get
this straight,

01:58:13.792 --> 01:58:15.521
is there someone here
who <i>is</i> my secretary,

01:58:15.594 --> 01:58:16.561
I've just never known it?

01:58:16.628 --> 01:58:17.561
No.

01:58:17.629 --> 01:58:18.892
I have no secretary.

01:58:18.964 --> 01:58:20.432
Right.

01:58:20.498 --> 01:58:22.762
Okay.

01:58:22.834 --> 01:58:23.926
How you doin', Isaac?

01:58:24.002 --> 01:58:25.163
Good.

01:58:25.237 --> 01:58:26.500
Good.

01:58:26.571 --> 01:58:27.902
Okay.

01:58:33.111 --> 01:58:36.012
What'd you say before?

01:58:36.081 --> 01:58:38.516
[Door closes]

01:58:38.583 --> 01:58:40.051
When?

01:58:40.118 --> 01:58:42.485
-- You met a guy at Anthony's.
-- Yeah.

01:58:42.554 --> 01:58:43.953
It doesn't matter.

01:58:44.022 --> 01:58:46.150
When is someone new gonna
step up to the table,

01:58:46.224 --> 01:58:49.285
someone who <i>wants</i>
cable sports?

01:58:49.361 --> 01:58:52.387
You know, Dana...

01:58:52.464 --> 01:58:56.765
my nephew Christopher

01:58:56.835 --> 01:58:58.599
is a trauma surgeon

01:58:58.670 --> 01:59:02.334
at a city hospital
in Detroit.

01:59:02.407 --> 01:59:04.341
Whenever
he loses somebody,

01:59:04.409 --> 01:59:07.276
it usually takes him
a couple of weeks

01:59:07.345 --> 01:59:09.279
to get up off the mat.

01:59:09.347 --> 01:59:12.908
I tell him it's an overcrowded,
underfunded hospital.

01:59:12.984 --> 01:59:15.146
<i>He doesn't listen, though.</i>

01:59:15.220 --> 01:59:18.349
<i>He usually talks
about ditching medicine</i>

01:59:18.423 --> 01:59:21.552
and opening up a restaurant
in Albuquerque.

01:59:21.626 --> 01:59:22.855
Why Albuquerque?

01:59:22.927 --> 01:59:24.053
<i>I don't know,</i>

01:59:24.129 --> 01:59:27.497
but it's always
Albuquerque.

01:59:27.565 --> 01:59:32.025
At best, you had
maybe 2/3 of the budget

01:59:32.103 --> 01:59:35.095
needed to do the job
in a market

01:59:35.173 --> 01:59:38.905
that was oversaturated
when you got there.

01:59:38.977 --> 01:59:40.775
If it goes down,

01:59:40.845 --> 01:59:43.280
you get up off the mat,

01:59:43.348 --> 01:59:46.283
you go to I.A.
with Dan and Casey,

01:59:46.351 --> 01:59:49.685
and...you try it again.

01:59:49.754 --> 01:59:50.880
What do you do?

01:59:50.955 --> 01:59:53.014
Two trees, a hammock
[Chuckles]

01:59:53.091 --> 01:59:55.150
And a stack of books
this high.

01:59:55.226 --> 01:59:56.455
[Telephone rings]

01:59:56.528 --> 01:59:57.859
Let me ask you --

01:59:57.929 --> 01:59:59.624
Ah, hang on.

02:00:03.401 --> 02:00:05.392
Yeah?

02:00:07.572 --> 02:00:08.971
Thanks.

02:00:09.040 --> 02:00:12.305
Time Warner
just kicked out.

02:00:12.377 --> 02:00:14.903
-- Really? -- <i>But I wouldn't
worry about it, though.</i>

02:00:14.979 --> 02:00:16.811
<i>-- They were never sew--
-- What was the stock price?</i>

02:00:16.881 --> 02:00:18.315
$27 a share.

02:00:18.383 --> 02:00:20.545
Huh.

02:00:20.618 --> 02:00:22.814
You were saying something
about a guy at Anthony's.

02:00:22.887 --> 02:00:24.252
Yeah. No.

02:00:24.322 --> 02:00:25.687
Uh, yeah.

02:00:25.757 --> 02:00:27.418
I should get back
to work, though.

02:00:27.492 --> 02:00:30.359
<i>Okay, remember
what I said.</i>

02:00:30.428 --> 02:00:31.918
Yeah.

02:00:36.468 --> 02:00:38.835
Three years, I always thought
she was my secretary.

02:00:38.903 --> 02:00:41.531
She was good.

02:00:41.606 --> 02:00:43.267
Yep.
[Clears throat]

02:00:43.341 --> 02:00:45.605
Say, while we're
tying up loose ends,

02:00:45.677 --> 02:00:47.372
do we share an office,
or am I just here a lot?

02:00:47.445 --> 02:00:49.174
-- You're just here a lot.
-- I have my own office?

02:00:49.247 --> 02:00:50.180
-- Yeah.
-- Where?

02:00:50.248 --> 02:00:51.306
[Sighs]

02:00:51.383 --> 02:00:53.112
-- That's my confession.
-- What?

02:00:53.184 --> 02:00:55.744
This is your office.
Mine's someplace else.

02:00:55.820 --> 02:00:57.083
You're kidding.

02:00:57.155 --> 02:00:58.213
Nope.

02:00:58.289 --> 02:00:59.381
Where?

02:00:59.457 --> 02:01:00.549
I don't know.

02:01:00.625 --> 02:01:02.491
I just always
liked this one.

02:01:02.560 --> 02:01:05.393
All right. Well, it seemed
to work out okay.

02:01:05.463 --> 02:01:07.932
-- Yeah. -- Next place, we
should share an office again.

02:01:07.999 --> 02:01:09.296
Yeah.

02:01:09.367 --> 02:01:11.392
And we should have someone who
pretends to be our secretary.

02:01:11.469 --> 02:01:14.302
-- Yeah.
-- Dan?

02:01:14.372 --> 02:01:15.168
Hey.

02:01:15.240 --> 02:01:17.402
These are for you.

02:01:17.475 --> 02:01:20.308
<i>Elliot, look, last night,</i>

02:01:20.378 --> 02:01:22.073
seriously,
I was talking to Kim.

02:01:22.147 --> 02:01:24.707
-- I was doing a little thing.
-- They're not from me.

02:01:24.783 --> 02:01:26.774
Like it'd kill you to give
me flowers once in a while?

02:01:28.420 --> 02:01:32.118
It says

02:01:32.190 --> 02:01:33.123
What else does it say?

02:01:33.191 --> 02:01:35.683
<i>It just says "R.W."</i>

02:01:35.760 --> 02:01:38.661
Robert Wagner
has sent me flowers.

02:01:38.730 --> 02:01:39.754
That was nice of him.

02:01:39.831 --> 02:01:41.856
Or maybe Reggie White.

02:01:41.933 --> 02:01:44.334
<i>All-pro defensive end Reggie
White can send me flowers,</i>

02:01:44.402 --> 02:01:45.767
but do you ever
think to, Elliot?

02:01:45.837 --> 02:01:47.669
-- I don't take you for granted.
-- Yes, you do.

02:01:47.739 --> 02:01:49.332
You're not our secretary,
by any chance, are you?

02:01:49.407 --> 02:01:51.466
-- I <i>prefer assistant.</i>
-- <i>Get out.</i>

02:01:51.543 --> 02:01:52.840
Five minutes!

02:01:52.911 --> 02:01:54.970
<i>Arthur Brown:
And, so, it's only logical.</i>

02:01:55.046 --> 02:01:57.140
<i>I mean, I'm just using rational logic
and sensibility that in that situation,</i>

02:01:57.215 --> 02:02:00.549
<i>you bunt with one strike and one
out and the go-ahead run at first.</i>

02:02:00.618 --> 02:02:02.586
<i>I mean, I gotta say,
I think Joe Torre</i>

02:02:02.654 --> 02:02:05.089
<i>should be run out of town
on just that play alone.</i>

02:02:05.156 --> 02:02:06.590
Right. Caller,
how much experience

02:02:06.658 --> 02:02:08.558
do you have coaching
at the major-league level?

02:02:08.626 --> 02:02:10.253
<i>Well, I never coached
pro ball or anything.</i>

02:02:10.328 --> 02:02:11.693
-- Semi-pro?
-- No.

02:02:11.763 --> 02:02:13.060
-- College?
-- No.

02:02:13.131 --> 02:02:15.964
Okay, Joe Torre's been coaching
baseball for about 430 years.

02:02:16.034 --> 02:02:18.093
-- You got a girlfriend?
-- No.

02:02:18.169 --> 02:02:20.570
-- This is why. You interested in
buying Continental Corp? -- No.

02:02:20.638 --> 02:02:22.265
Okay, then
we're hanging up now.

02:02:22.340 --> 02:02:23.899
Dan, you want to take us
to commercial?

02:02:23.975 --> 02:02:25.067
With pleasure.

02:02:25.143 --> 02:02:26.406
You're watching
"Sports Night" on CSC,

02:02:26.478 --> 02:02:27.604
so stick around.

02:02:27.679 --> 02:02:28.942
<i>Dave:
We're in commercial.</i>

02:02:29.013 --> 02:02:30.071
60 seconds back.

02:02:30.148 --> 02:02:31.479
By the way, everybody,

02:02:31.549 --> 02:02:33.347
Time Warner kicked out
this morning.

02:02:33.418 --> 02:02:34.943
-- Who needed them?
-- We needed them.

02:02:35.019 --> 02:02:36.680
They wouldn't
have kept CSC.

02:02:36.754 --> 02:02:39.189
Neither will Fox or Disney, but it
looks like that's all that's left.

02:02:39.257 --> 02:02:40.747
-- Not all.
-- That's right.

02:02:40.825 --> 02:02:43.089
-- There's still the power of fate.
-- La forza def destino.

02:02:43.161 --> 02:02:45.255
-- <i>Jeremy...</i> -- <i>It's been said,
Dana, that in desperate</i> times...

02:02:45.330 --> 02:02:47.424
-- Yes.
-- Give me out graphics on 4.

02:02:47.499 --> 02:02:48.466
30 seconds back.

02:02:48.533 --> 02:02:49.728
-- Thank you.
-- The Pacific Ocean's

02:02:49.801 --> 02:02:51.599
completely different from
the Atlantic, you know.

02:02:51.669 --> 02:02:53.763
-- I know. It's on the other side.
-- Yes, it is.

02:02:53.838 --> 02:02:55.397
You know what's just
a quick plane ride away?

02:02:55.473 --> 02:02:57.635
-- Asia?
-- Hawaii.

02:02:57.709 --> 02:02:59.006
You ever been to Hawaii?

02:02:59.077 --> 02:03:00.135
Covered two pro bowls.

02:03:00.211 --> 02:03:02.145
Shot par at Mauna Lani.
I've met Don Ho.

02:03:02.213 --> 02:03:04.238
Oh, so you're a bit
of an expert.

02:03:04.315 --> 02:03:06.647
-- I understand the island ways.
-- Danny, I would love to --

02:03:06.718 --> 02:03:08.015
We don't have to tell them
yes or no,

02:03:08.086 --> 02:03:09.611
but we got to tell them
what we're thinking.

02:03:09.687 --> 02:03:11.781
It's a really good
offer, Casey.

02:03:11.856 --> 02:03:13.654
-- It's gonna be the best one we get.
Dave: In 10.

02:03:13.725 --> 02:03:15.523
-- We need to talk about it, okay?
-- Yeah.

02:03:15.593 --> 02:03:18.563
Is it possible I got
flowers from Raquel Welch?

02:03:18.630 --> 02:03:19.620
No.

02:03:19.697 --> 02:03:20.823
Okay.

02:03:20.899 --> 02:03:22.560
<i>Dave." In 3...2...</i>

02:03:22.600 --> 02:03:23.726
That's all for us tonight.

02:03:23.801 --> 02:03:25.030
Remember, please, if you're
going out on a date

02:03:25.103 --> 02:03:26.468
and you want
to impress someone,

02:03:26.538 --> 02:03:29.940
it's a "dog <i>eat</i> dog world,"
not a doggy-dog world.

02:03:30.008 --> 02:03:31.976
I'm Casey McCall
alongside Dan Rydell.

02:03:32.043 --> 02:03:34.239
You've been watching
"Sports Night" on CSC.

02:03:34.312 --> 02:03:35.473
We'll see you tomorrow.

02:03:35.547 --> 02:03:37.345
Good night.

02:03:37.415 --> 02:03:38.678
-- <i>Animation.</i>
-- <i>Go.</i>

02:03:38.750 --> 02:03:39.581
We're out.

02:03:39.651 --> 02:03:41.176
Good show.

02:03:41.252 --> 02:03:43.186
So help me God, I thought
it was a doggy-dog world.

02:03:43.254 --> 02:03:44.653
-- Anthony's.
-- Yeah.

02:03:44.722 --> 02:03:46.156
No. Wait. Hang on.

02:03:46.224 --> 02:03:47.623
Our corporate
parent is up for sale.

02:03:47.692 --> 02:03:49.387
The only people who seem
interested in buying

02:03:49.460 --> 02:03:51.053
would almost surely dump
the cable network,

02:03:51.129 --> 02:03:52.961
and one of those people
dropped out this morning.

02:03:53.031 --> 02:03:54.521
You still don't want
to break our luck?

02:03:54.599 --> 02:03:56.363
-- Man, Jeremy!
-- What?

02:03:56.434 --> 02:03:58.596
-- What?
-- The power of fate.

02:03:58.670 --> 02:04:00.297
The power of fate...

02:04:00.371 --> 02:04:02.396
<i>which is actually something
I just said a minute ago,</i>

02:04:02.473 --> 02:04:04.134
so I shouldn't have even
needed prompting.

02:04:04.208 --> 02:04:07.234
Well, you guys definitely
turned me around on that one.

02:04:08.546 --> 02:04:09.980
<i>They got the aquarium.</i>

02:04:10.048 --> 02:04:11.277
What aquarium?

02:04:11.349 --> 02:04:14.375
With the dolphins
and the -- the fish

02:04:14.452 --> 02:04:16.887
and the mammals
over there in San Francisco.

02:04:16.955 --> 02:04:18.389
-- Ah, it's in San Diego.
-- Really?

02:04:18.456 --> 02:04:19.548
-- Yeah.
-- Who cares?

02:04:19.624 --> 02:04:21.251
They frolic, they splash,

02:04:21.326 --> 02:04:23.727
-- <i>and they have</i> a <i>ball.</i>
-- <i>Danny...</i>

02:04:23.795 --> 02:04:25.593
-- you can go there with a Laker Girl.
-- Dan.

02:04:25.663 --> 02:04:27.153
-- She never met a guy
like you before. -- Hey.

02:04:27.231 --> 02:04:31.668
Hey. What am I supposed to do,
see Charlie twice a year?

02:04:31.736 --> 02:04:33.602
[Sighs]
Christmas and when?

02:04:33.671 --> 02:04:34.900
They have jet planes
now, Casey.

02:04:34.973 --> 02:04:36.031
<i>I'd be working
six nights.</i>

02:04:36.107 --> 02:04:38.872
It's not like I can get
in a plane every time --

02:04:38.943 --> 02:04:40.570
-- I'm saying she gets on a plane.
-- Danny, come on.

02:04:40.645 --> 02:04:42.807
-- Look... -- I'm not kidding.
She's not tied down to a job.

02:04:42.880 --> 02:04:44.780
You tell her you're not willing to
live that far away from Charlie.

02:04:44.849 --> 02:04:47.580
You tell her you support this family
and your business just moved,

02:04:47.652 --> 02:04:49.086
and the family's
got to move, too.

02:04:49.153 --> 02:04:51.588
You tell her to get
her ass on a plane.

02:04:51.656 --> 02:04:54.591
Let's cross that bridge
when we get there, okay?

02:04:54.659 --> 02:04:56.058
All right.

02:04:56.127 --> 02:04:57.754
Hi.

02:04:57.829 --> 02:04:59.456
Excuse me
for interrupting.

02:04:59.530 --> 02:05:00.793
My boyfriend would kill me
if he knew I saw you

02:05:00.865 --> 02:05:02.833
and didn't get you
to sign something.

02:05:02.900 --> 02:05:03.833
-- Sure.
-- Thanks.

02:05:03.901 --> 02:05:04.834
You want another?

02:05:04.902 --> 02:05:05.994
Yeah.

02:05:06.070 --> 02:05:08.630
By the way,
my roommate's friend

02:05:08.706 --> 02:05:11.175
knows a girl
you used to date.

02:05:11.242 --> 02:05:12.971
-- Who?
-- Rebecca Wells.

02:05:13.044 --> 02:05:15.877
[Glass shatters]

02:05:15.947 --> 02:05:17.938
-- Is he all right?
-- Yeah, he's fine.

02:05:19.150 --> 02:05:21.676
Yeah, I j-- I just think
I need to get some air.

02:05:23.655 --> 02:05:25.145
[Sighs]

02:05:25.223 --> 02:05:26.713
Dana: You guys all right over there?
-- Yeah.

02:05:26.791 --> 02:05:29.817
-- Yeah, now it's getting good.
Dana: <i>Okay.</i>

02:05:29.894 --> 02:05:31.362
<i>Natalie: Jeremy...</i>

02:05:31.429 --> 02:05:33.830
-- Yeah? -- There's something
I think you should know.

02:05:33.898 --> 02:05:36.162
-- Oh, God. -- I'm not
wearing any socks right now.

02:05:36.234 --> 02:05:38.862
-- Oh, please let me out. -- I
know you have a little thing,

02:05:38.936 --> 02:05:41.405
and I thought it would be
wrong for me to not tell you

02:05:41.472 --> 02:05:43.440
that I'm not wearing
any socks right now.

02:05:43.508 --> 02:05:45.772
-- I don't believe you.
-- Jeremy...

02:05:45.843 --> 02:05:47.811
One day you'll see
that my love for you

02:05:47.879 --> 02:05:50.211
isn't the product of
liquor-induced mood swings,

02:05:50.281 --> 02:05:52.682
and that I'm yours for
the taking at your command.

02:05:52.750 --> 02:05:54.149
<i>And that the day
I broke up with you</i>

02:05:54.218 --> 02:05:56.380
was the most regrettable
day of my life.

02:05:56.454 --> 02:05:57.387
Okay...

02:05:57.455 --> 02:05:59.219
but I broke up with you.

02:05:59.290 --> 02:06:00.280
I find you loathsome,

02:06:00.358 --> 02:06:01.848
and my hatred of you
knows no bounds.

02:06:01.926 --> 02:06:02.893
Okay.

02:06:02.960 --> 02:06:05.258
I'm not wearing
any socks.

02:06:05.329 --> 02:06:06.262
Okay.

02:06:06.330 --> 02:06:07.764
Do you feel my foot?

02:06:07.832 --> 02:06:11.063
All right, that's it! That's it!
Move, move! Out, out, out!

02:06:12.370 --> 02:06:14.236
[Clears throat]
Thank you.

02:06:20.745 --> 02:06:22.144
What do you need, Dana?

02:06:22.213 --> 02:06:24.341
<i>Man: Three beers
and a coconut pifia colada.</i>

02:06:24.415 --> 02:06:26.315
Hey, you, I need
to talk to you.

02:06:26.384 --> 02:06:28.045
Stay right there.
Two beers.

02:06:28.119 --> 02:06:30.850
You guys
did a good show tonight.

02:06:30.922 --> 02:06:31.855
Thank you.

02:06:31.923 --> 02:06:33.220
I liked the call-in.

02:06:33.291 --> 02:06:35.259
How did you know Time Warner
was gonna drop out at 27?

02:06:35.326 --> 02:06:36.760
-- I didn't.
-- You did.

02:06:36.828 --> 02:06:37.852
I guessed.

02:06:37.929 --> 02:06:39.328
You didn't guess.
You had information.

02:06:39.397 --> 02:06:40.421
I had a lot
of information.

02:06:40.498 --> 02:06:42.432
That's what makes me good
at guessing.

02:06:42.500 --> 02:06:44.127
If you've got
inside information

02:06:44.202 --> 02:06:46.466
and you're passing it,
you're breaking the law,

02:06:46.537 --> 02:06:48.301
and I don't want you
talking to me.

02:06:48.372 --> 02:06:50.170
I don't have
inside information,

02:06:50.241 --> 02:06:51.834
and I wasn't
talking to you.

02:06:51.909 --> 02:06:52.967
YOU came over tO me.

02:06:53.044 --> 02:06:55.138
-- Nonetheless.
-- Yeah?

02:06:55.213 --> 02:06:58.376
I'm just saying, I know a thing
or two about securities law.

02:06:58.449 --> 02:06:59.245
Why?

02:06:59.317 --> 02:07:01.376
Because I do.

02:07:01.452 --> 02:07:02.510
Okay.

02:07:02.587 --> 02:07:04.282
So, how are you?

02:07:04.355 --> 02:07:06.824
-- Me?
-- Yeah.

02:07:06.891 --> 02:07:09.155
I've been thinking a lot
about opening a restaurant.

02:07:09.227 --> 02:07:10.194
Where?

02:07:10.261 --> 02:07:12.127
Albuquerque.

02:07:12.196 --> 02:07:14.187
Thanks, Jack.

02:07:14.265 --> 02:07:16.757
I'm going back
to my friends now.

02:07:16.834 --> 02:07:18.427
Okay.

02:07:18.503 --> 02:07:20.870
We were having
an interesting conversation.

02:07:20.938 --> 02:07:23.100
-- About what?
-- The power of fate.

02:07:23.174 --> 02:07:25.768
Okay.

02:07:25.843 --> 02:07:27.902
So goodbye.

02:07:27.979 --> 02:07:30.573
MDl-Transcom's
gonna come in as a bidder.

02:07:30.648 --> 02:07:32.707
-- How do you know that?
-- I don't.

02:07:32.784 --> 02:07:33.808
You're guessing.

02:07:33.885 --> 02:07:34.750
Yeah.

02:07:34.819 --> 02:07:36.218
-- But you're right.
-- Yeah.

02:07:36.287 --> 02:07:38.722
What does MDl-Transcom want
with Continental Corp?

02:07:38.790 --> 02:07:40.656
I could tell you,
but the answer's a little dry.

02:07:40.725 --> 02:07:42.955
-- <i>You're saying I wouldn't be
able to understand it?</i> -- <i>Yeah.</i>

02:07:43.027 --> 02:07:44.586
Probably not,
'cause all I've got

02:07:44.662 --> 02:07:46.562
is a master's in
broadcast communication.

02:07:46.631 --> 02:07:50.465
C.C. owns cable providers
in certain markets,

02:07:50.535 --> 02:07:52.970
which means they also own
the coaxial cable

02:07:53.037 --> 02:07:54.505
which was originally laid.

02:07:54.572 --> 02:07:57.132
Coaxial cable provides
much greater bandwidth

02:07:57.208 --> 02:07:59.142
than conventional
phone lines,

02:07:59.210 --> 02:08:02.043
so it provides extremely fast
Internet access.

02:08:05.116 --> 02:08:08.245
Who are you?

02:08:08.319 --> 02:08:11.050
No one
whose name you'd know.

02:08:11.122 --> 02:08:13.386
I'm going back
to my friends.

02:08:13.457 --> 02:08:16.051
To talk about
the power of fate?

02:08:16.127 --> 02:08:19.256
Yeah.

02:08:19.330 --> 02:08:22.322
<i>La forza def destino.</i>
