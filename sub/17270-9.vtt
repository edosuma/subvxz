00:00.001 --> 00:02.735
<i>Stephen: My name
is Stephen Jameson.</i>

00:02.737 --> 00:04.537
<i>I'm one of the Tomorrow People.</i>

00:04.538 --> 00:06.606
<i>They call our powers
the three t's.</i>

00:06.607 --> 00:08.173
<i>Cara: Stephen?
Telepathy...</i>

00:08.175 --> 00:09.376
<i>Stephen: Telekinesis...</i>

00:09.377 --> 00:10.477
<i>And teleportation.</i>

00:10.478 --> 00:13.646
<i>There is a shadow war going on
between us and Ultra...</i>

00:13.647 --> 00:16.116
- No!
<i>The secret organization that hunts us.</i>

00:16.117 --> 00:18.685
<i>The only way to keep
my species from going extinct</i>

00:18.686 --> 00:20.253
<i>Is to find my father.</i>

00:20.254 --> 00:23.789
<i>And the only way to do that
is by working for the enemy.</i>

00:24.324 --> 00:26.592
<i>Previously on
the Tomorrow People...</i>

00:28.962 --> 00:30.163
Dad, I need your help.

00:30.164 --> 00:31.396
Save all of them.

00:31.431 --> 00:32.564
How?

00:32.566 --> 00:33.633
Thanatos.

00:33.634 --> 00:36.803
I think that Thanatos was
some sort of secret research program

00:36.804 --> 00:37.903
That my dad was a part of.

00:39.272 --> 00:40.706
I want him alive,
you understand?

00:47.714 --> 00:49.716
Something's happened.
John should be back by now.

00:49.717 --> 00:53.218
He's at Ultra.
They got him.

00:55.021 --> 00:58.058
So. Here's how we can
proceed.

00:58.059 --> 01:00.527
The simplest and most painless
way is for you to tell me

01:00.528 --> 01:02.361
Me all I need to know.

01:02.729 --> 01:04.830
In which case we'll
kill you quickly.

01:07.200 --> 01:10.336
But you're not going to do that,
are you? I didn't think so.

01:10.337 --> 01:12.505
Either way, this ends the same.

01:12.506 --> 01:15.541
You will be dead. And I will
know everything inside your head,

01:16.076 --> 01:18.411
Such as where your
rebel friends are hiding.

01:18.412 --> 01:21.213
The only difference is...

01:21.714 --> 01:24.150
I might have to work
a bit harder.

01:24.151 --> 01:28.720
And you'll have to suffer in
ways you could never imagine.

01:30.690 --> 01:33.426
[screaming]

01:33.427 --> 01:36.962
Show me, John.
And this all can end.

01:38.765 --> 01:39.965
[screaming]

01:42.135 --> 01:43.435
If I ever get free...

01:48.608 --> 01:49.775
You'll what?

01:51.000 --> 01:57.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:59.319 --> 02:01.420
I broke out before
you were born, boy.

02:10.263 --> 02:12.397
[choking]

02:13.666 --> 02:15.467
Enough!

02:17.337 --> 02:18.571
If you kill him,

02:18.572 --> 02:20.573
He can't tell us where
the Tomorrow People are hiding.

02:20.574 --> 02:22.742
You are your father's son.
Both with the same weakness.

02:22.743 --> 02:26.713
Misplaced compassion.
For him of all people.

02:26.714 --> 02:30.483
If you only knew the truth,
you'd strangle him with your own hands.

02:30.484 --> 02:33.553
What truth?
Tell him, John.

02:33.554 --> 02:36.623
Go ahead, think of it
as a last confession.

02:36.624 --> 02:39.658
Come on. He ought to know
how his father died.

02:42.629 --> 02:43.795
You?

02:47.433 --> 02:49.334
You're lying.

02:51.538 --> 02:53.305
I'm sorry, Stephen.

03:07.187 --> 03:09.522
<i>Cara: Stephen?
What just happened?</i>

03:09.523 --> 03:11.291
Nothing.
<i>Don't lie to me.</i>

03:11.292 --> 03:13.625
Whatever you just
felt, I felt it too.

03:14.127 --> 03:15.461
You're hurting.

03:15.462 --> 03:17.530
[thinking] John. He's not gonna
last much longer.

03:17.531 --> 03:20.866
We gotta get him out of here
before this founder guy kills him.

03:21.868 --> 03:24.137
I don't know about this.
You have a better plan?

03:24.138 --> 03:27.873
Let's just run the odds
on it working.

03:28.141 --> 03:33.146
Step one, we locate Jedikiah's secret
paranormal girlfriend before Ultra does.

03:33.147 --> 03:35.215
Tim: <i>Actually, based on your</i>
<i>former success rate in</i>

03:35.216 --> 03:40.085
Bringing in breakouts, I would
place those odds only at 22.34%.

03:41.254 --> 03:43.155
And then what?
We kidnap her.

03:43.823 --> 03:45.825
I know, but it's our only play.

03:45.826 --> 03:49.862
And then? We hope that Jedikiah
cares enough about this chick to agree

03:49.863 --> 03:52.164
To a prisoner exchange?
Stephen, you have anything yet?

03:54.867 --> 03:58.470
[thinking] there's literally
not a single personal item in his office.

04:04.944 --> 04:07.312
<i>[thinking] Wait a second.
Cara: What?</i>

04:08.815 --> 04:12.085
[thinking] Found a picture of
Jedikiah and Morgan.

04:12.086 --> 04:15.587
[thinking] He's smiling. Never seen
him look like that.

04:22.795 --> 04:26.365
Oh god, he's even
creepier when he's happy.

04:28.401 --> 04:31.504
Tim, can you use any landmarks
to pinpoint where this was taken?

04:31.505 --> 04:33.338
<i>Tim: I can certainly try.</i>

04:38.244 --> 04:40.579
<i>It appears to be Montauk point.</i>

04:43.850 --> 04:45.450
She's close, I can sense her.

04:46.019 --> 04:48.186
Okay, then where is she?

04:55.328 --> 04:57.362
Seems like a good
place to lay low.

04:59.165 --> 05:02.601
Hello? Morgan?
Anybody home?

05:04.203 --> 05:05.437
What?

05:06.406 --> 05:08.574
She's psychic, she already knows
we're here.

05:08.575 --> 05:11.044
<i>[Cara thinking] it's okay, we just
want to talk.</i>

05:11.045 --> 05:13.645
<i>[Cara thinking] Jedikiah sent us
to check on you.</i>

05:16.082 --> 05:17.483
Morgan: <i>Who are you?</i>

05:17.484 --> 05:19.985
[Cara thinking]
we're like you, Morgan.

05:20.553 --> 05:21.820
How do I know
you're not agents?

05:22.088 --> 05:24.589
[Russell thinking] Just gotta get
these cuffs on her.

05:25.058 --> 05:28.560
Cuffs? You're here to take my powers.
Morgan, no!

05:33.666 --> 05:35.133
It's no use teleporting.

05:35.968 --> 05:37.969
Wherever you go,
I'll track you.

05:42.108 --> 05:43.708
Have it your way.

05:46.879 --> 05:49.281
Sooner or later,
you're coming with us!

06:03.963 --> 06:05.864
A-ha, give me that.

06:06.099 --> 06:07.632
She's feisty.

06:08.134 --> 06:09.935
Guess Jedikiah has a type.

06:32.024 --> 06:33.692
Morgan, I...

06:35.795 --> 06:37.830
We need to talk.

06:37.831 --> 06:41.700
About your girlfriend.
I'm assuming you'd like to see her again.

06:41.834 --> 06:43.703
Where is she?
She's safe.

06:43.704 --> 06:46.171
How do I know
you're not bluffing?

06:48.841 --> 06:50.709
Let me show you.

06:56.115 --> 06:58.850
You can't do this!
Let me go!

07:00.553 --> 07:03.054
All right, what do you want?
What do you think?

07:03.790 --> 07:04.891
John.

07:04.892 --> 07:08.360
Hurt him, I will destroy the one
thing in this world you care about.

07:10.930 --> 07:13.031
What do you want me to do?

07:13.800 --> 07:17.969
Give me back the thing I love,
and I might just return the favor.

07:30.249 --> 07:31.716
Give me a minute?

07:42.562 --> 07:44.996
Why'd you do it, John?

07:45.198 --> 07:47.066
They told me it had to be done.

07:47.067 --> 07:50.001
That your father had
gone off the reservation.

07:50.903 --> 07:53.673
Jedikiah said he'd
become a danger to us all.

07:53.674 --> 07:54.973
So you blew him up?

07:56.108 --> 07:57.342
You really want to hear this?

07:58.644 --> 07:59.878
I have to know.

08:03.249 --> 08:05.417
I set a bomb in his car.

08:05.952 --> 08:07.185
And I waited.

08:08.254 --> 08:10.322
He wanted me to think
I had killed him.

08:10.857 --> 08:13.158
But he teleported out at
the last moment.

08:13.860 --> 08:17.329
I followed him. That's when
I caught up with your father.

08:18.998 --> 08:20.432
And I shot him.

08:25.238 --> 08:27.172
I didn't want to, Stephen.

08:31.277 --> 08:33.078
You know, all these years,
you've been telling your own

08:33.080 --> 08:36.349
People that my father
could return at any moment,

08:36.350 --> 08:38.683
When you knew you
put a bullet in him?

08:38.684 --> 08:40.919
If I could take it
all back I would.

08:40.921 --> 08:42.419
Well you can't.

08:43.923 --> 08:45.223
You're a fraud, John.

08:50.229 --> 08:54.065
Now you can go back and
tell Cara and everyone else the truth.

08:54.634 --> 08:57.235
No, it's not my job
to tell Cara you lied.

08:58.704 --> 09:00.205
That'd be too easy.

09:01.841 --> 09:06.077
But for now, we're gonna forget
the fact that you tried to kill my father.

09:08.047 --> 09:09.247
Why?

09:11.651 --> 09:13.351
Because Thanatos is real.

09:14.720 --> 09:17.956
My father's alive, and he is
out there, I'm sure of it.

09:20.092 --> 09:22.127
And I'm gonna get you
the hell out of here.

09:44.884 --> 09:46.351
Stephen, what is it?

09:47.687 --> 09:50.823
What? What is what? - I can feel you
trying to work up the courage to

09:50.824 --> 09:53.058
Ask me something.
So go ahead, just ask it.

09:54.961 --> 09:56.461
Is it about your dad?

09:57.363 --> 09:58.998
Yes, it's about dad.

09:58.999 --> 10:00.399
Then please don't.

10:00.400 --> 10:02.000
I need to find him.

10:02.368 --> 10:04.070
Well, I can't help you.

10:04.071 --> 10:06.072
You're trying to protect
me and Luca but the truth is

10:06.073 --> 10:07.840
You wanna see him just
as much as I do.

10:07.841 --> 10:09.240
Your father left us.

10:09.642 --> 10:11.177
I don't know why.
I don't care.

10:11.178 --> 10:14.013
I just don't want that kind
of chaos back in our life.

10:14.014 --> 10:15.815
I don't think he was crazy.

10:15.816 --> 10:18.583
You know it wasn't that simple.
He was protecting us.

10:20.419 --> 10:23.855
Did he ever mention anything to you
about something called the Thanatos project?

10:26.792 --> 10:29.095
All right, Stephen.
I think you need to stop.

10:29.096 --> 10:33.598
I know this is hard for you to hear,
but the three of us are better off without him.

10:34.233 --> 10:36.534
We're safer without him.

10:42.274 --> 10:44.542
May I have a moment please?

10:47.947 --> 10:50.048
I wonder what you want.

10:51.017 --> 10:55.053
Let me guess, your boss
this founder guy,

10:55.888 --> 10:58.456
Wants you to good cop
the information out of me?

10:59.458 --> 11:01.427
Where the tomorrow
people are hiding.

11:01.428 --> 11:04.497
No, I trained you myself.

11:04.498 --> 11:07.031
I know you're not
going to talk.

11:07.400 --> 11:09.167
That's not why I'm here.

11:10.136 --> 11:11.636
I'm here to say goodbye.

11:20.179 --> 11:21.479
Goodbye, son.

11:31.724 --> 11:33.057
True to the end.

11:43.436 --> 11:45.438
You wanted to see me?

11:45.439 --> 11:49.040
Yeah, I want you to explain
to me what it is I'm looking at here.

11:54.780 --> 11:57.081
Me taking away
Cara's powers. Why?

11:57.483 --> 12:00.519
That's interesting, because
when Cara and her little gang

12:00.520 --> 12:03.388
Kidnapped me her powers seemed
to be working just fine.

12:05.191 --> 12:06.658
I wonder why that is.

12:08.794 --> 12:10.595
I have a theory.

12:12.264 --> 12:13.965
There, did you see that?

12:15.101 --> 12:18.471
See what? - Yeah, it happens
really fast. Let me show you again.

12:18.472 --> 12:21.240
There. - I don't know
what I'm looking for.

12:21.241 --> 12:25.144
You know I didn't either.
This whole procedure seems very routine.

12:25.145 --> 12:28.179
And then, I saw that.

12:32.852 --> 12:35.386
Happens in the blink of an eye.

12:36.522 --> 12:38.189
The devil is in the details.

12:41.427 --> 12:45.196
You know what I think?
I think you stopped time.

12:45.898 --> 12:50.302
And I think you swapped out the serum
for something innocuous like saline,

12:50.303 --> 12:53.605
And then let Cara walk
out of here with her powers intact.

12:54.874 --> 12:58.610
Cara, John, you seem to have
a soft spot for the Tomorrow People.

13:02.281 --> 13:03.715
Not them.

13:04.884 --> 13:06.050
Her.

13:08.454 --> 13:10.421
I couldn't let you hurt her.

13:11.857 --> 13:14.459
Because you love her.
Clearly.

13:15.961 --> 13:19.230
Look, I know it was stupid.
And yet in this case, pardonable.

13:23.369 --> 13:27.573
I know what it feels like not to want
to see someone you love get hurt.

13:27.574 --> 13:30.608
In fact, that's why I
asked you here today.

13:31.310 --> 13:35.713
You see, I too have grown
attached to one of your kind.

13:38.551 --> 13:40.084
You're kidding.

13:41.887 --> 13:43.321
Do I look like I'm kidding?

13:44.390 --> 13:45.491
No.

13:45.492 --> 13:46.624
Good.

13:46.926 --> 13:49.093
See this relation
of mine, Morgan,

13:49.128 --> 13:51.496
Is being held hostage
by the Tomorrow People.

13:52.498 --> 13:55.501
They're threatening
to kill her unless I can set John free,

13:55.502 --> 13:57.502
Which clearly I can't.

13:58.404 --> 14:00.104
But you can.

14:07.913 --> 14:09.347
Last meal.

14:13.352 --> 14:15.019
Sorry about the jaw.

14:15.788 --> 14:17.155
What jaw?

14:29.460 --> 14:30.762
<i>[Stephen thinking]
you could've warned me.</i>

14:30.787 --> 14:31.980
[John thinking]
I said I was sorry.

14:32.005 --> 14:34.105
[Stephen thinking]
how'd you get out of the cuffs?

14:34.440 --> 14:36.007
Wait for Stephen.

14:41.280 --> 14:44.316
What now? This floor is lined
with D chips. You can't teleport out.

14:44.317 --> 14:46.184
We make it look real.

14:49.922 --> 14:53.259
Put up a little fight, will you?
We gotta sell this.

14:53.260 --> 14:54.592
Back off or he dies!

14:54.894 --> 14:56.462
I said back off!

14:56.463 --> 14:57.963
Unless your boss wants
to lose a nephew!

14:57.964 --> 14:59.899
Yeah? You're kind can't kill.

14:59.900 --> 15:01.099
Wanna bet?

15:02.134 --> 15:04.403
I aimed for your vest,
but the next one's in your face.

15:04.404 --> 15:05.905
Hold your fire!

15:05.906 --> 15:07.606
You know there's no
way out of here.

15:07.607 --> 15:09.774
Your powers don't work now, John.
Let the kid go.

15:10.376 --> 15:12.510
<i>[Stephen thinking]
D chips, 11 and one.</i>

15:31.497 --> 15:34.766
I take it John made it back
to your little underground grotto safely?

15:35.100 --> 15:37.435
[thinking]
<i>no agents, coast is clear.</i>

15:39.238 --> 15:40.438
Jedikiah!

15:40.639 --> 15:42.673
As promised.
Let's go.

15:42.975 --> 15:44.543
Take these cuffs off me.
No.

15:44.544 --> 15:46.110
We're not through yet.

15:47.146 --> 15:51.116
We are done negotiating.
You got your girlfriend, that was the deal.

15:51.117 --> 15:53.051
Cara, just hear him out.

15:54.620 --> 15:57.356
Well?
Wherever it is you're hiding,

15:57.357 --> 15:59.425
I'd like you to take Morgan with you.
What?

15:59.426 --> 16:00.792
Like hell!

16:01.193 --> 16:05.329
I want to be with you. - No,
John slipped while on my watch.

16:05.931 --> 16:08.033
That means there's going
to be a microscope on me,

16:08.034 --> 16:11.070
And the founder's going to sift through
my brain until he gets to the bottom of it,

16:11.071 --> 16:14.506
And if he finds you, Morgan,
the only way you can be safe

16:14.507 --> 16:16.508
Is if I don't know
where you are.

16:16.509 --> 16:20.312
She is not coming with us. She could
lead a kill squad straight to the lair.

16:20.313 --> 16:21.647
My uncle won't let that happen.

16:21.648 --> 16:23.448
He wants you to
keep Morgan safe.

16:24.583 --> 16:27.251
Protecting your own, that's what
John's all about, right?

16:28.420 --> 16:32.356
Please don't do this. Please take her
or I'll call a kill squad myself.

16:38.998 --> 16:40.431
Again.

16:47.106 --> 16:49.373
Doesn't look like you're in limbo.
Again!

16:57.616 --> 17:00.351
Well, still here.
Again.

17:00.419 --> 17:03.754
This is what you broke me out
of Ultra for? Never should've left.

17:04.356 --> 17:06.457
It's gonna work.
Says who?

17:07.159 --> 17:09.627
Some crusty old professor
friend of your father's?

17:09.628 --> 17:11.663
Limbo exists, I've seen it.

17:11.664 --> 17:14.566
Stopping time while teleporting
is the only way to get there.

17:14.567 --> 17:15.800
Maybe you're not
trying hard enough.

17:15.801 --> 17:17.468
Oh, I'm teleporting just fine.

17:17.703 --> 17:20.539
You're the one who's
supposed to stop time mid-jump.

17:20.540 --> 17:24.442
It can't be done! It's like farting
and sneezing at the same time.

17:24.542 --> 17:26.644
Scientifically impossible.

17:27.012 --> 17:30.115
We all want to find Roger,
but there's no sense in killing yourself.

17:30.116 --> 17:31.315
Or me.

17:32.017 --> 17:33.584
Whatever, I'm thirsty anyway.

17:36.355 --> 17:39.724
Are you okay?
You seem different since you've been back.

17:40.059 --> 17:42.127
You wanna talk about it?

17:42.128 --> 17:45.531
What, about me being psychically
mind-reamed by the founder?

17:45.532 --> 17:48.067
I'd rather try and forget
what happened, Cara.

17:48.068 --> 17:50.069
This doesn't make any sense.

17:50.070 --> 17:52.805
The founder... Why would he
want to destroy us if he's one of us?

17:52.806 --> 17:54.605
Okay, break's over.

17:55.107 --> 17:58.509
You don't have to do this.
Actually I do.

18:06.318 --> 18:09.555
She's going to find out.
I'm not going to be the one to tell her.

18:09.556 --> 18:13.192
Cara's emotionally connected to you.
She feels what you feel.

18:13.193 --> 18:15.960
And I'd rather she find out
from me than by reading your mind.

18:16.361 --> 18:18.530
You know what that
would do to her.

18:18.531 --> 18:21.265
And to you, it's not worth it.

18:21.500 --> 18:24.268
Besides, my dad's not dead.

18:28.240 --> 18:31.577
Even if that were true,
Stephen. I shot him.

18:31.578 --> 18:33.411
I tried to kill him.

18:34.046 --> 18:37.481
And then I tried to cover it up
by leading our people in this place.

18:39.118 --> 18:41.552
This whole time
I've been living a lie.

18:43.288 --> 18:45.356
Again.

18:59.338 --> 19:01.973
So tonight I thought
I'd cook some Chinese.

19:02.741 --> 19:04.442
No thanks, not hungry.

19:05.444 --> 19:08.980
In case you missed that,
that was code for "I'm sorry."

19:12.217 --> 19:15.987
I guess, when it comes to your dad
I just shut down.

19:16.555 --> 19:19.290
I'm sorry, I don't mean
to shut you down too.

19:21.660 --> 19:26.163
When I mentioned Thanatos, I got
the feeling that it meant something to you.

19:27.599 --> 19:29.301
I don't know what that is.

19:29.302 --> 19:31.036
[thinking] How does he know
about Thanatos?

19:31.037 --> 19:33.138
Why're you lying to me.
What?

19:33.139 --> 19:36.340
Tell me the truth, please.
I just want to know more about dad.

19:38.143 --> 19:40.244
I should've known
this day would come.

19:46.318 --> 19:49.720
When your dad took off,
I boxed up all his research materials.

19:50.222 --> 19:52.957
It's just scribbles
and number formulas.

19:53.225 --> 19:56.460
Stephen, just be careful.
Why?

19:57.296 --> 20:00.766
Because you've been trying to turn
your father into someone he never was,

20:00.767 --> 20:04.169
And I'm afraid if you open that box.
What?

20:04.170 --> 20:06.570
You're going to
be disappointed.

20:07.506 --> 20:09.608
Maybe it's better to
just leave it alone.

20:09.609 --> 20:11.876
No. Sorry, mom.
I can't do that.

20:12.477 --> 20:14.845
No, you can't, can you?

20:16.148 --> 20:19.684
'Cause you're a seeker.
Just like him.

20:32.497 --> 20:35.534
Well it's unfortunate
that John escaped.

20:35.535 --> 20:37.836
But remember he was a
very formidable agent.

20:37.837 --> 20:41.672
Yes, I also seem to remember that
you took quite a shine to him personally.

20:42.341 --> 20:44.842
Is there something you
want to tell me, Jedikiah?

20:46.378 --> 20:49.680
I'd like to spare you the humiliation
of having your mind read.

20:50.916 --> 20:52.717
No, you're right.

20:54.586 --> 20:56.620
There is something that...

20:57.789 --> 21:00.859
For lack of a better way of
saying it, I have been deceiving you.

21:00.860 --> 21:02.728
It has nothing to do with John.

21:02.729 --> 21:04.695
But I am hiding
something from you.

21:05.764 --> 21:07.498
A personal relationship.

21:09.768 --> 21:13.605
Continue. - The nature of which,
if my colleagues found out about it,

21:13.606 --> 21:15.106
Could undermine my authority.

21:16.608 --> 21:21.545
You mean she's one of my kind?
[scoffing] of all the indiscretions.

21:22.547 --> 21:23.748
Why?

21:24.650 --> 21:26.652
You can dig through my brain
as much as you want,

21:26.653 --> 21:29.153
But the truth of the matter
is it was an affair of the heart.

21:29.888 --> 21:33.691
Somewhere along the line
my scientific curiosity became...

21:34.293 --> 21:35.594
Unprofessional.

21:35.595 --> 21:38.763
Well, don't beat
yourself up, Jedikiah.

21:39.765 --> 21:41.665
You're only human.

21:42.434 --> 21:46.071
Now. Would you like to
tie up our loose end,

21:46.072 --> 21:47.705
Or should I?

21:50.909 --> 21:52.710
No, I'll take care of it.

21:54.413 --> 21:55.579
Good.

22:29.948 --> 22:31.115
Tim?

22:31.350 --> 22:33.651
I need you to try
and load something for me.

22:37.889 --> 22:43.695
My name is professor Aldus Crick.
It is precisely 8:00 am

22:43.696 --> 22:49.067
And this is trial number one
of the Thanatos project.

22:49.068 --> 22:50.836
See John, I'm telling you.

22:50.837 --> 22:53.071
This is how my dad
managed to disappear.

22:53.072 --> 22:55.105
Because of some old lab video?

22:56.041 --> 22:59.043
What does that prove? - Since when
were did you become so cynical?

22:59.378 --> 23:00.612
The closer we get to
finding Roger,

23:00.613 --> 23:02.012
The more you check out.

23:03.048 --> 23:05.883
Cara, we should talk.
Alone.

23:10.389 --> 23:11.655
What's up with them?

23:13.392 --> 23:14.559
Lots.

23:14.560 --> 23:17.729
<i>Yes, well unfortunately, it appears
our research subject</i>

23:17.730 --> 23:22.167
<i>Is late as usual.
Just picking up donuts.</i>

23:22.168 --> 23:23.467
Oh, bear claws. My favorite.

23:26.772 --> 23:30.140
<i>Shall we begin?
Aldus: Why not?</i>

23:31.676 --> 23:33.478
We're not going to find
him, Cara.

23:33.479 --> 23:34.778
How do you know that?

23:35.747 --> 23:38.249
Because I killed him.
What?

23:39.084 --> 23:41.986
My last op for Ultra
was an assassination.

23:42.721 --> 23:45.189
Jedikiah didn't just
modify me to kill.

23:46.091 --> 23:48.259
He ordered me
to kill his own brother.

23:49.461 --> 23:50.961
That's impossible.

23:51.396 --> 23:52.730
It's the truth.

24:00.705 --> 24:03.908
So all these years, you've
kept us locked down here,

24:04.676 --> 24:07.878
Promised us a future, a way to
find the refuge, that was...

24:07.979 --> 24:09.915
I did it for Roger.

24:09.916 --> 24:13.284
I promised him that I would protect
the Tomorrow People. And I did.

24:13.718 --> 24:14.919
You lied to them.

24:15.921 --> 24:18.023
This whole thing, it's been
nothing but a lie.

24:18.024 --> 24:20.624
Not all of it.
Don't touch me.

24:24.563 --> 24:28.066
The only thing I ever
asked you for was honesty.

24:28.067 --> 24:32.236
Honesty? How were you honest with me
about what happened with Stephen?

24:32.504 --> 24:36.807
It happened because I could
never be with you. Not all the way.

24:37.976 --> 24:43.314
Now I know why. All along,
you've been hiding yourself from me, John.

24:58.163 --> 25:05.202
<i>It's 1:18 am. Trial number 347
of the Thanatos project.</i>

25:05.537 --> 25:06.704
<i>Stand by.</i>

25:09.174 --> 25:10.774
[groaning]

25:11.710 --> 25:13.778
<i>Roger: Results are again
inconclusive.</i>

25:13.779 --> 25:17.516
It's just the same thing over
and over and over again.

25:17.517 --> 25:19.951
No offense, dude.
But no wonder your dad went bonkers.

25:19.952 --> 25:22.686
Tim, can you fast-forward to the end,
please?

25:22.854 --> 25:24.955
<i>Tim: I am happy to, Stephen.</i>

25:27.192 --> 25:28.593
[grunting]

25:28.594 --> 25:31.395
<i>Yet again, inconclusive.
Son of a bitch!</i>

25:31.863 --> 25:33.999
[Roger panting]

25:34.000 --> 25:35.265
Tim, turn it off.

25:35.534 --> 25:37.903
No, wait, wait.
Give it a second.

25:37.904 --> 25:40.672
<i>I'm running out of time.
Chin up, Roger.</i>

25:40.673 --> 25:43.275
<i>There's always
trial number 458.</i>

25:43.276 --> 25:45.877
<i>No. We have to try
the alternate method.</i>

25:45.878 --> 25:48.812
<i>You can't be serious.
It's suicide.</i>

25:53.518 --> 25:54.653
Where you going?

25:54.654 --> 25:56.286
Going to go see the professor.

25:59.591 --> 26:02.359
Stephen.
I'm sorry to just show up.

26:02.961 --> 26:04.428
You're leaving because of me.

26:04.963 --> 26:06.932
Nonsense. I'm just looking
for a change of scenery.

26:06.933 --> 26:08.032
Long overdue.

26:08.800 --> 26:10.001
Where will you go?

26:10.002 --> 26:12.136
Who of us knows
where we are headed?

26:12.237 --> 26:15.939
That's the beauty of life.
We can never see around the next bend,

26:16.975 --> 26:19.443
Individually or as a species.

26:20.579 --> 26:22.314
Who would ever have
imagined that

26:22.315 --> 26:25.883
A people like you would be born
of our own primitive building blocks?

26:26.251 --> 26:29.753
You are a very special
young man, Stephen.

26:30.722 --> 26:32.423
Like your father.

26:34.726 --> 26:37.861
But you knew that I couldn't reach him
by stopping time while teleporting.

26:37.896 --> 26:40.397
You and my dad, you tried
how many times, and failed.

26:41.566 --> 26:42.800
You saw the tapes...

26:42.867 --> 26:45.337
He said there was an
alternate way to get to limbo.

26:45.338 --> 26:47.371
You said it was suicide.

26:48.306 --> 26:51.442
Professor, my dad had to die first,
didn't he?

26:51.943 --> 26:53.812
It was only ever a
theory, really.

26:53.813 --> 26:57.182
We could never prove it
because an experiment that only

26:57.183 --> 27:02.319
Gets to be tried once
is hardly sound scientific method.

27:02.554 --> 27:03.721
No, it worked.

27:04.022 --> 27:05.856
What? How on earth
do you reckon that?

27:05.890 --> 27:08.393
I ran the experiment myself,
by accident. When I was drowning

27:08.394 --> 27:11.763
I must have stopped time
without even realizing it. I saw him.

27:11.764 --> 27:12.831
Stephen...

27:12.832 --> 27:14.131
It's possible.

27:14.766 --> 27:18.102
Technically.
But highly unlikely.

27:18.169 --> 27:21.972
Furthermore, if your father went
through so much trouble to disappear,

27:22.941 --> 27:28.212
Consider the possibility
that he doesn't want to be found.

27:28.913 --> 27:31.683
Why?
Stephen, there are things afoot

27:31.684 --> 27:34.184
That you can't possibly
understand, my boy.

27:35.820 --> 27:36.987
[crashing]
[gunfire]

27:37.255 --> 27:38.422
Oh! No!

27:42.327 --> 27:45.262
No, no... Don't...
Oh, no. Don't...

27:57.375 --> 28:00.010
Someone was here with
our departed friend.

28:01.212 --> 28:02.846
I can feel it.

28:11.656 --> 28:14.958
Stephen?
What happened?

28:15.694 --> 28:19.563
They killed him. They murdered
Crick right in front of me.

28:19.998 --> 28:21.332
Why would Ultra kill Crick?

28:21.333 --> 28:24.169
Because he confirmed that
there's a way for us to find my dad.

28:24.170 --> 28:26.837
Your dad isn't in limbo, Stephen.
He's dead.

28:28.239 --> 28:29.473
What do you mean, dead?

28:30.709 --> 28:32.342
There's no point in
lying anymore.

28:32.377 --> 28:34.211
Could someone please
explain to me what's going on?

28:34.379 --> 28:37.816
Later. - It didn't work because
it was never going to work.

28:37.817 --> 28:39.818
But there's another way.
Wherever my dad is,

28:39.819 --> 28:42.853
You can't get there by
stopping time while teleporting.

28:43.321 --> 28:47.726
Limbo exists in the time between
life and death.

28:47.727 --> 28:49.560
What exactly are you
saying, Stephen?

28:50.862 --> 28:54.164
Well... You have to try
to kill me.

28:55.166 --> 28:56.468
No.
That is insane.

28:56.469 --> 28:58.803
I was almost dead when
I saw him. That's how I got there,

28:58.804 --> 29:01.038
And it's exactly what
happened when you shot him.

29:01.206 --> 29:03.074
Okay? It was all part
of my dad's plan.

29:03.075 --> 29:05.110
He wanted you to kill him.
He needed you to,

29:05.111 --> 29:08.045
So that he could stop time right at
the moment of his death.

29:08.279 --> 29:11.048
All we have to do
is re-create that moment.

29:12.016 --> 29:13.518
It's the only way I can
bring him back.

29:13.519 --> 29:16.354
And you are the only one
who can kill.

29:16.355 --> 29:17.955
Listen to me, Stephen.

29:18.089 --> 29:21.826
Jedikiah ordered me to kill your father.
There was no plan.

29:21.827 --> 29:25.463
Roger didn't know! I saw it
on his face, I read it in his mind.

29:25.464 --> 29:28.065
I held his body in my hands.

29:28.900 --> 29:33.604
So trust me when I tell you
your father is dead.

29:34.239 --> 29:36.573
Cara: Stephen, what you saw
was a vision.

29:37.275 --> 29:40.944
You were hoping, like we were all hoping,
that Roger was still out there.

29:41.880 --> 29:43.081
But it's not real.

29:43.082 --> 29:47.152
You're both wrong. He's alive.
And I need your help.

29:47.153 --> 29:51.055
This isn't about me. This is
about all of us. The refuge is real,

29:51.056 --> 29:53.156
But we can't get
there without my dad.

29:53.458 --> 29:55.860
Now, the whole reason
you guys tracked me down

29:55.861 --> 29:57.128
Was so that I could find him.

29:57.129 --> 30:02.065
So either you believe that
I'm the chosen one or you don't.

30:03.768 --> 30:05.168
Which is it, Cara?

30:18.383 --> 30:19.551
Hey.
Hey!

30:19.552 --> 30:20.819
What are you doing home?

30:20.820 --> 30:23.320
Is everything okay?
Yeah! Yeah, everything's fine.

30:24.189 --> 30:26.491
I know it's late notice
but I was hoping

30:26.492 --> 30:28.492
I could have a few friends over
for dinner.

30:28.793 --> 30:31.095
Friends as in other than Astrid,
friends?

30:31.096 --> 30:33.832
Yeah. Mom, I do have
friends, from work.

30:33.833 --> 30:34.932
No, of course!

30:35.066 --> 30:37.401
Uh... Yeah, that
would be great.

30:37.836 --> 30:39.437
But we'll probably have to
go to the store,

30:39.438 --> 30:41.405
Because I don't think we
have anything to eat.

30:41.940 --> 30:43.041
No.

30:43.042 --> 30:45.176
Uh, okay, but we could
order pizzas.

30:45.177 --> 30:47.478
Yeah. - Luca's at practice tonight,
so if you want Romero's,

30:47.479 --> 30:48.947
Tonight's your night.

30:48.948 --> 30:51.982
But we still don't have anything to drink,
so let me get you some money.

30:52.250 --> 30:54.584
No, I don't...
No, come on, this'll be fun.

30:55.186 --> 30:58.188
It's been a long time
since you've had friends over.

30:58.423 --> 31:00.959
Hey, I could pick up
some dessert from Broussards.

31:00.960 --> 31:03.560
No, mom, okay?
Thank you. That's enough.

31:03.862 --> 31:05.696
So, you never told me.

31:06.097 --> 31:08.732
Did you find anything
in that box of your dad's stuff?

31:12.403 --> 31:15.038
No, you were right.
Just a bunch of old junk.

31:15.406 --> 31:16.573
Thank you.

31:25.917 --> 31:27.384
[pulsating]

31:29.153 --> 31:30.554
You got my message?

31:31.022 --> 31:32.523
I couldn't have waited
another minute.

31:32.524 --> 31:33.623
Neither can I.

31:43.501 --> 31:45.535
So how do you know Stephen?

31:46.170 --> 31:51.643
We, uh, work together, splicing genes
for science and whatnot.

31:51.644 --> 31:54.211
Well, you don't look like
the research institute type.

31:54.345 --> 31:57.414
Well, you don't look like
the high school type.

31:57.916 --> 32:01.686
Excuse me. I'm going to steal you.
Careful of this one.

32:01.687 --> 32:03.086
Yes, I can see.

32:03.554 --> 32:04.721
It's fun.

32:06.190 --> 32:07.992
Well, your friends
are interesting.

32:07.993 --> 32:09.259
Aren't they?
Yeah.

32:09.527 --> 32:12.397
And they all work at your
uncle's company? - No.

32:12.398 --> 32:15.265
Remember when you got angry
at me about the psychic subway dwellers?

32:15.266 --> 32:16.433
Yes.

32:19.003 --> 32:20.538
Right.
Mmm-hmm.

32:20.539 --> 32:21.673
And Cara's here?

32:21.674 --> 32:23.640
The one who's not-so-secretly
in love with you?

32:23.875 --> 32:26.510
Yep.
She's actually with him.

32:28.246 --> 32:29.314
Oh.

32:29.315 --> 32:33.483
What a troll. I have no idea
what she sees in him.

32:34.152 --> 32:35.318
Unbelievable.

32:35.553 --> 32:38.121
Thanks for that.
No problem.

32:40.258 --> 32:42.492
Okay, enough staring.
I wasn't...

32:42.527 --> 32:44.428
Grab some pizza or something.
I wasn't staring.

32:49.200 --> 32:50.268
Hey.

32:50.269 --> 32:54.538
Uh, I don't want to be nosy, but
do you have any idea what's going on?

32:55.573 --> 32:56.641
What do you mean?

32:56.642 --> 33:00.144
Stephen and I have been friends
for a very long time,

33:00.145 --> 33:03.513
And this whole get-together thing,
it's not really like him.

33:05.583 --> 33:07.317
He said you were smart.

33:11.089 --> 33:13.824
Well, it was nice to finally
meet the Tomorrow People.

33:14.525 --> 33:16.194
Think my mom bought it?

33:16.195 --> 33:19.463
Yeah. There is one part
I didn't buy, though.

33:21.065 --> 33:22.133
Why?

33:22.134 --> 33:25.003
Why? Why was it suddenly
so important that the people

33:25.004 --> 33:27.304
From the two sides of
your life should finally meet?

33:27.505 --> 33:28.705
What's going on?

33:31.042 --> 33:32.410
Don't say nothing.

33:32.411 --> 33:34.711
[chuckling defensively]
it was written all over Cara's face.

33:36.314 --> 33:38.016
Cara?
Mmm.

33:38.017 --> 33:39.416
You guys comparing notes on me?

33:40.018 --> 33:43.854
She cares about you, as do I.

33:46.024 --> 33:47.491
So what's the story?

33:51.396 --> 33:52.762
Um...

33:54.198 --> 33:56.333
I'm gonna try and bring
my dad home.

33:59.470 --> 34:03.273
You know where he is?
How did you find him?

34:03.608 --> 34:04.774
Doesn't matter.

34:07.745 --> 34:08.911
Okay.

34:11.449 --> 34:13.117
How long are you gonna be gone?

34:13.118 --> 34:14.217
I don't know.

34:16.054 --> 34:19.723
Right. So this is like
a goodbye party.

34:20.190 --> 34:23.493
No. No, Astrid.
It's not like that.

34:27.465 --> 34:30.900
You're scared.
Why don't you let me go with you?

34:31.302 --> 34:33.637
Where I'm going,
you can't come with me.

34:36.040 --> 34:38.775
But I promise I will be back.

35:11.075 --> 35:12.676
I'm so sorry, Morgan.

35:42.440 --> 35:43.840
Is it done?

35:44.175 --> 35:45.610
I told you I'd take care of it.

35:45.611 --> 35:47.245
Well, if you wouldn't
mind showing me,

35:47.246 --> 35:49.579
Your recent behavior has
given me reason to doubt.

35:50.414 --> 35:51.982
Dig in.
I've got nothing to hide.

36:02.627 --> 36:07.899
Well done. But that doesn't
pardon you, Jedikiah.

36:07.900 --> 36:10.368
Now, I know that you don't have
the capacity to read minds,

36:10.369 --> 36:12.869
So let me tell you
exactly what I'm thinking.

36:14.438 --> 36:18.475
If it weren't for your nephew,
I'd have very little patience for you.

36:19.177 --> 36:22.879
Bear that in mind as we groom
Stephen for his ultimate purpose.

36:35.693 --> 36:37.460
You're still alive.

36:38.396 --> 36:40.231
I guess I misjudged
your boyfriend.

36:40.232 --> 36:41.232
Yeah, you did.

36:41.233 --> 36:44.034
And how do we know you weren't
followed back down here?

36:44.635 --> 36:46.436
Trust me.

36:47.605 --> 36:50.073
Jedikiah made sure there were
no more loose ends.

37:04.755 --> 37:06.890
He faked killing you?

37:08.326 --> 37:10.327
I have to admit,
he is an evil genius.

37:11.729 --> 37:13.563
What's going on?
Where is everyone?

37:13.631 --> 37:15.665
[thinking] <i>we're getting</i>
<i>ready to kill Stephen.</i>

37:16.500 --> 37:17.667
Don't ask.

37:20.638 --> 37:21.706
Devil's advocate.

37:21.707 --> 37:25.075
If Stephen's wrong,
you'll have killed two chosen ones.

37:25.876 --> 37:28.011
Get me the phenobarbital,
will ya?

37:32.917 --> 37:34.485
He's got a point.

37:34.486 --> 37:36.619
Look. Whatever happens
is on me.

37:37.922 --> 37:40.358
Just promise you'll take care of
my mom and my brother.

37:40.359 --> 37:42.092
So that's why you
invited us over?

37:42.393 --> 37:44.728
I just don't want her to think
that I abandoned them.

37:45.329 --> 37:46.697
Like my dad.

37:46.698 --> 37:52.703
You want me to tell her the truth,
about you, your dad, our entire species?

37:52.704 --> 37:54.804
Whatever it takes
to keep them safe.

37:58.943 --> 38:00.977
You ready?
You've gone over the plan?

38:01.779 --> 38:03.881
I inject him,
one unit at a time,

38:03.882 --> 38:06.082
Slowing his heart rate
until he flatlines.

38:06.617 --> 38:08.718
Pretty straightforward, really.

38:09.353 --> 38:11.955
I'll set it up with Tim so that
he can monitor your vitals.

38:13.257 --> 38:14.657
Can I ask you a favor?

38:14.725 --> 38:17.160
You know, just in case
this doesn't work.

38:17.528 --> 38:19.396
A last will and testament?

38:19.964 --> 38:21.865
Let John off the hook,
will you?

38:23.768 --> 38:25.769
Why would that matter to you?

38:26.604 --> 38:29.005
Our kind is hanging on
by a thread.

38:29.573 --> 38:34.878
And when you two are
at odds, all of us are vulnerable.

38:35.880 --> 38:41.050
Look, it's not like I want to see you
two together, but he loves you, Cara.

38:41.519 --> 38:43.587
That's why he couldn't
tell you the truth.

38:43.588 --> 38:46.890
To be honest, I don't know if
I could either.

38:47.858 --> 38:49.025
[door opening and closing]

38:49.493 --> 38:51.495
Is this band equipment?

38:51.496 --> 38:52.730
How we looking, Tim?

38:52.731 --> 38:54.697
<i>Tim: Online to monitor
Stephen's vitals.</i>

38:54.999 --> 38:57.902
<i>But if I could point out
the irrationality of this plan...</i>

38:57.903 --> 38:59.904
Just give me the exact
time for brain death so that

38:59.905 --> 39:01.671
I can inject him
with the epinephrine.

39:01.872 --> 39:03.606
You ready, Stephen?

39:03.741 --> 39:05.909
Let's do this already.

39:21.692 --> 39:23.793
I'll be in your head
the whole way.

39:25.863 --> 39:28.998
I've spent six years trying
to atone for killing your father.

39:29.900 --> 39:34.938
This ability you've been hiding
may feel evil, but today it's a gift.

39:45.683 --> 39:51.822
Heart rate?
<i>50... 40... 30...</i>

39:51.823 --> 39:54.757
<i>Blood pressure is 80
over 60 and falling rapidly.</i>

39:55.025 --> 39:58.796
<i>He's bottoming out.
Heart rate is becoming faint.</i>

39:58.797 --> 40:03.099
I've ceased to detect it. - Only 10 seconds
before he loses consciousness.

40:04.535 --> 40:07.904
Do it now, Stephen! If you want
to stop time, you have 10 seconds.

40:17.581 --> 40:19.983
Did it work?
Did he do it?

40:20.718 --> 40:22.585
I don't know.

40:23.621 --> 40:24.989
I can't reach him
telepathically.

40:24.990 --> 40:26.556
It's like he's not
there at all.

40:27.691 --> 40:28.993
How long do we have to
bring him back?

40:28.994 --> 40:32.095
<i>Tim: You have only one minute
before brain damage begins.</i>

40:43.107 --> 40:44.274
Forty seconds.

40:44.909 --> 40:48.211
Stephen?
Stephen, can you hear me?

40:50.648 --> 40:51.816
<i>Tim: Thirty seconds...</i>

40:51.817 --> 40:53.550
I'm giving him the epinephrine,
I'm bringing him back.

40:53.584 --> 40:54.884
Not yet.

40:54.919 --> 40:57.587
This is what he wanted.
It's not time.

40:58.389 --> 40:59.822
Tim: <i>Twenty seconds...</i>

41:00.624 --> 41:02.692
I'm bringing him back.

41:04.495 --> 41:05.762
Nothing's happening.

41:06.163 --> 41:07.564
Tim: <i>Ten seconds.</i>

41:09.133 --> 41:11.669
Come on, Stephen.
Come on, come back to us.

41:11.670 --> 41:14.103
[panting] I'm not
gonna let you die.

41:15.005 --> 41:17.173
<i>Tim: T-minus zero.
That's time.</i>

41:18.843 --> 41:20.710
<i>[thinking] please, Stephen.
Don't leave us.</i>

41:20.878 --> 41:22.845
I don't know if we can do
this without you.

41:23.614 --> 41:26.883
You have to come back.
Please.

41:35.759 --> 41:38.795
[panting]

41:39.663 --> 41:40.830
What happened?

41:44.101 --> 41:45.935
I saw him.

41:47.771 --> 41:49.806
We have to find my dad's body.
