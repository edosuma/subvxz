SURABAYA
INDONESIA

00:55.055 --> 01:00.227
- OK Boan, how much you got here?
- About 1,800.

01:00.478 --> 01:03.397
- What's going on?
- There's Bagley.

01:03.648 --> 01:09.821
Mr. Bagley! Something haywire.
We haven't loaded enough pipe.

01:10.072 --> 01:13.910
- Less than 2,000 feet.
- That'll be enough.

01:14.118 --> 01:20.204
On Huangatan, it didn't come
until we were past 26,000 feet.

01:20.412 --> 01:24.459
This hole proves out within 2,000,
or it's a write-off.

01:45.315 --> 01:47.858
How are you this evening?

01:51.320 --> 01:53.865
All right.

02:05.082 --> 02:09.963
The barometer is still falling.
It's a lousy forecast all right.

02:10.213 --> 02:13.843
We should stay here
another 48 hours.

02:14.093 --> 02:18.473
Every hour we delay gives others
a chance of beating us to the island.

02:18.682 --> 02:21.767
- I thought only we knew...
- We'll sail right away.

02:22.018 --> 02:25.272
You'll be sorry.

02:25.480 --> 02:29.234
All right, Mr. Carnahan,
ready to let go.

02:29.484 --> 02:35.488
- Stand by fore and aft.
- OK, haul the gangway ashore!

03:10.568 --> 03:13.484
Let it go.

03:21.409 --> 03:24.497
- Roy.
- Fred.

03:26.123 --> 03:30.585
Well, here's to the big one.

05:57.857 --> 06:01.696
<i>Mayday, mayday.</i>

06:03.114 --> 06:06.535
<i>Mayday.</i>

06:22.261 --> 06:25.764
I'm reminded of Amsterdam.

06:25.973 --> 06:31.976
Ever eat a raw herring with a beer
chaser and a scoop of ice cream?

06:47.285 --> 06:51.747
<i>- Captain here.
- I picked up a mayday call.</i>

06:51.955 --> 06:56.169
<i>- It faded before I could get a fix.
- Keep listening.</i>

06:56.377 --> 06:59.882
Let me know if you get anything.

07:05.637 --> 07:09.764
Like you said:
"The hell with the weather."

07:13.935 --> 07:18.398
We can get out of this
by backtracking around Timor.

07:18.607 --> 07:23.236
- It'll only cost us a few days.
- Keep on course, I'm fine.

07:27.324 --> 07:31.872
I gotta admit, for a New York
desk guy, you got a lot of guts.

07:32.081 --> 07:35.584
I sold this one to the board.

07:35.793 --> 07:41.215
If that island doesn't produce huge,
I'll be wiping windshields.

07:54.518 --> 07:58.730
Men.
Carnahan.

08:04.028 --> 08:08.993
I'd have told you earlier,
but I couldn't risk any talk.

08:11.202 --> 08:17.293
Men, we may be sailing into
the history books. Hit the lights.

08:19.253 --> 08:23.382
I believe we're headed for
the biggest oil strike ever.

08:23.632 --> 08:27.509
- Here in the magic circle.
- It's magic all right.

08:27.759 --> 08:32.054
Are we supposed to find oil
under 2,000 fathoms of sea?

08:32.306 --> 08:38.604
Just sea is what the charts say.
Now let's take a look a low angle.

08:40.023 --> 08:43.525
This was taken in 1943.

08:43.735 --> 08:47.865
This wake was left by the ship
that took the photograph.

08:48.115 --> 08:54.121
No sign of land. Here's a fog bank
you wouldn't look at twice.

08:54.371 --> 08:57.626
Let's look at another picture.

08:57.834 --> 09:01.879
This is taken from precisely
the same angle.

09:02.129 --> 09:06.340
Same area, same fog bank.

09:08.842 --> 09:14.432
This was taken two weeks ago.
35 years later.

09:14.682 --> 09:20.104
A bank of fog that doesn't change
a wisp in 35 years. Fantastic.

09:20.313 --> 09:24.442
Still nothing to explore,
except for one reason.

09:24.692 --> 09:29.239
A spy satellite photographed it
by mistake.

09:29.490 --> 09:35.746
I got hold of the classified pictures
via a donation to someone.

09:35.996 --> 09:40.209
No names, but he lives
on Pennsylvania Ave.

09:40.459 --> 09:43.046
OK, fellas.

09:43.296 --> 09:47.839
Roy Bagley, would you take over
and let science make the point?

09:54.805 --> 10:00.395
The satellite was to analyse
exhaust gases from a missile test.

10:00.603 --> 10:04.901
So it was loaded with
two special kinds of film.

10:05.110 --> 10:08.862
No, first the infrared.

10:10.823 --> 10:15.370
The different colors represent
different surface temperatures.

10:15.578 --> 10:19.374
- You mean there's land there?
- Correct, Joe.

10:19.624 --> 10:23.504
An island,
hidden by a perpetual fog bank.

10:23.754 --> 10:28.798
Never seen by human eye
nor walked by human foot.

10:30.091 --> 10:34.721
The infrared patterns aren't like
any I've ever seen.

10:34.971 --> 10:39.602
More surprising, though, is
what the spectrograph picked up.

10:39.852 --> 10:43.814
Chemical composition
of our mysterious fog bank.

10:44.064 --> 10:49.987
Free hydrocarbon radicals,
excess nitrogen, carbon dioxide.

10:50.195 --> 10:54.242
And, not poisonous
but very damn curious...

10:54.492 --> 11:00.248
This has to be caused by vapors
seeping up through the ground.

11:00.457 --> 11:04.499
- Vapors from petroleum deposits.
- Yes!

11:04.750 --> 11:10.924
That island is the tip of a huge
underground tankjust waiting for us.

11:11.132 --> 11:15.511
- I'm betting everything I've got.
- I'll take 50 cents of that.

11:15.720 --> 11:20.934
The excess CO2 might also be
accounted for by animal respiration.

11:21.184 --> 11:25.732
- Turn the lights on.
- Animal breathing.

11:25.982 --> 11:27.943
Are you crazy?

11:28.151 --> 11:33.907
And I'm not so sure human feet
have never walked the island before.

11:34.157 --> 11:40.164
In 1605, Fernando De Queres
was blown south from Tenotang.

11:40.414 --> 11:46.001
He wrote of the piercing the
white veil. That's the cloud bank.

11:46.252 --> 11:49.963
And landing on the beach of the skull,
where he heard the roar -

11:50.213 --> 11:54.260
- of the greatest beast...

11:54.468 --> 12:00.225
The rest of that log entry
was suppressed by Rome.

12:00.475 --> 12:05.521
In 1749, a water-logged lifeboat
was found in the same area.

12:05.771 --> 12:11.695
It was empty,
but drawn in blood on the port -

12:11.903 --> 12:18.953
- was a likeness of a huge,
slouchy humanoid thing.

12:19.203 --> 12:21.788
And this strange warning:

12:24.080 --> 12:28.543
"From thy wedding with the creature
who touches heaven, lady, -

12:28.751 --> 12:33.215
- God preserve thee."

12:33.424 --> 12:39.513
I also heard of a note in a bottle
from a dying Japanese in 1944...

12:39.763 --> 12:43.435
What the hell are you talking about?
Who is this joker?

12:43.643 --> 12:47.064
- Beats me.
- He's wearing a crew jersey.

12:47.273 --> 12:50.109
I'll pay any fair amount
for my... passage.

12:50.318 --> 12:53.488
- You're a stowaway?
- Jack Prescott. From Princeton.

12:53.739 --> 12:56.824
- Dept. Of Primate Paleonthology.
- You lying hippie!

12:57.033 --> 13:01.827
You're from another oil company!
The meeting's over.

13:02.036 --> 13:05.956
He's got one of our T-shirts.

13:11.921 --> 13:16.300
This doesn't mean a thing. Gulf
or Exxon can fix a fake passport.

13:16.508 --> 13:20.180
- Who the hell are you?
- I am Jack Prescott...

13:20.430 --> 13:27.563
My interest in your island
has got nothing to do with oil.

13:27.813 --> 13:31.943
You're not even a good liar. You
couldn't find out where we're going.

13:32.193 --> 13:38.449
- You bought charts!
- Come on. Who'd you pay off?

13:41.033 --> 13:46.079
They hadn't sold charts for this area
in years. A friend tipped me.

13:46.287 --> 13:50.918
I did pick up
some charts in Surabaya.

13:51.168 --> 13:57.008
Take this spy below till he's hungry
enough to stop spouting ape shit.

13:57.217 --> 14:00.471
Let's go. Come on.

14:11.984 --> 14:15.779
- There's something out there.
- Oh, come on!

14:16.029 --> 14:20.072
- Honest to God, look!
- Quit horsing around.

14:21.991 --> 14:24.285
Come back here!

14:24.535 --> 14:29.541
There's something out there!
About 2 o'clock. Use your glasses.

14:30.834 --> 14:33.671
Son of a bitch, it's a raft!

14:55.860 --> 14:58.530
All stop.

15:31.605 --> 15:34.274
She's alive!

15:49.287 --> 15:51.874
Gently.

15:54.877 --> 16:00.007
I've had first-aid training, Captain.
Will you all clear out of here?

16:00.258 --> 16:02.927
- You have to undress her, huh?
- It's usual.

16:03.135 --> 16:07.432
In case of internal injury
or shock syndrome.

16:07.641 --> 16:10.811
- Get outta here!
- Clear out.

16:20.985 --> 16:24.823
Eye Magnate. Beverly Hills.

16:25.073 --> 16:29.787
There's no sign of
injuries anywhere.

16:31.496 --> 16:36.627
C-Y-N-A-R-A. Sounds like a yacht.

16:36.877 --> 16:42.551
- Careless yachtsman, to lose this.
- Remember that mayday call?

16:48.974 --> 16:53.271
You can stop sweating. Navy
record's clean, it all checks out.

16:53.479 --> 16:56.733
Fingerprints.
The guy's kosher.

16:58.356 --> 17:02.278
I know just how to use him, too.

17:05.238 --> 17:11.662
The girl's about to come to. She
could be hysterical, so follow me.

17:15.291 --> 17:21.631
- Can I get a cheeseburger here?
- You went to medical school, right?

17:21.839 --> 17:25.761
What have you got, crystal balls?

17:26.011 --> 17:29.014
There's nothing I haven't checked.

17:29.222 --> 17:32.977
I know the day and hour
you completed your toilet training.

17:33.227 --> 17:37.604
Now we gotta figure a way for you
to work off your room and board.

17:37.854 --> 17:44.277
- You're pretty good with a camera.
- I've snapped a few monkeys.

17:44.527 --> 17:49.575
Congratulations.
You're now our official photographer.

18:17.019 --> 18:20.273
Hello. Everything's fine.

18:20.523 --> 18:25.070
You're safe and well
on an American merchant vessel.

18:28.572 --> 18:31.910
Where's Harry and everyone?

18:38.500 --> 18:44.173
- You mean they're gone?
- Do you remember anything?

18:47.969 --> 18:51.639
No. No.

18:57.393 --> 19:00.396
Yeah...

19:02.732 --> 19:05.985
I was on deck and then...

19:07.945 --> 19:11.742
- Then I was swimming to a star.
- To a light.

19:11.992 --> 19:15.496
Let her call it a star.

19:15.705 --> 19:21.294
The life-raft was blown over board
near you. It had an automatic flare.

19:21.544 --> 19:25.173
I'm Fred Wilson, I'm in charge.

19:25.423 --> 19:29.553
The yacht didn't get very far
after the SOS.

19:29.803 --> 19:35.806
The radio reported that someone
found a piece of charred hull.

19:36.891 --> 19:40.478
We're sorry, ma'am.

19:42.272 --> 19:45.442
So am I.

19:47.444 --> 19:50.949
Harry had discovered me.

19:52.366 --> 19:58.289
He was going to put me in a movie
he was making in Hong Kong.

19:58.539 --> 20:01.626
Dumb luck.

20:03.169 --> 20:07.216
But I guess I really can't complain.

20:08.633 --> 20:14.553
When you're alone adrift
in the Pacific and somebody just...

20:14.804 --> 20:19.893
- Who spotted me, by the way?
- That young fellow.

20:24.064 --> 20:27.066
How can I ever thank you?

20:30.612 --> 20:34.033
I'm Dwan.

20:36.996 --> 20:42.500
D-W-A-N. That's my name.
Like Dawn, -

20:42.751 --> 20:48.591
- except that I switched two letters
to make it more memorable.

20:48.841 --> 20:53.969
- I'm a mere Jack.
- You must be kidding.

20:54.219 --> 21:00.225
How could anybody
who saved my life be mere to me?

21:00.434 --> 21:03.854
You need some rest.

21:04.104 --> 21:09.193
I haven't had a good one of those
in years.

21:11.654 --> 21:15.950
- Are we headed back to Singapore?
- Not directly, ma'am.

21:21.874 --> 21:27.546
I guess it doesn't matter.
I'm in no rush.

21:30.800 --> 21:36.052
Harry probably wouldn't have
put me in that movie anyhow.

21:41.725 --> 21:45.146
Oh, my God!

21:48.190 --> 21:52.112
What a meaningful miracle!

21:52.363 --> 21:56.742
- I owe my life to a movie.
- Is that so?

21:56.951 --> 22:00.121
I swear to God.

22:00.330 --> 22:04.167
Harry was showing
this film that I refused to watch.

22:04.417 --> 22:09.547
That's why I was up on deck
when the yacht exploded.

22:09.798 --> 22:15.718
Did you ever meet anyone whose
life was saved by "Deep Throat"?

22:15.927 --> 22:19.597
Come on, men, let her rest.

22:25.853 --> 22:29.190
Maybe my luck has changed.

24:26.308 --> 24:28.519
You know something?

24:28.770 --> 24:33.401
I always wondered how Cortés felt
when he first saw the Inca treasure.

24:33.609 --> 24:37.445
It was Pizarro,
and he died busted.

24:57.256 --> 25:02.052
Here we go...
Solid land all right.

25:02.303 --> 25:08.225
This is its profile east to west.
Typical Pacific formation...

25:08.475 --> 25:13.023
This would be the slope at the beach,
the mountainous sector at the west.

25:13.273 --> 25:15.525
Let's get in closer.

25:18.153 --> 25:21.324
- What was that?
- Just a glitch.

25:21.574 --> 25:25.702
- False echo off a flock of birds.
- Spot anything unusual?

25:25.952 --> 25:29.787
- Not a thing.
- Look at the screen, Fred.

25:37.588 --> 25:41.799
All those going ashore,
report to the companionway.

25:46.513 --> 25:50.436
Hi there.
How do you like this for beach wear?

25:50.686 --> 25:54.815
Fantastic. I'm afraid
you can't come ashore, though.

25:55.024 --> 25:58.277
Wait a minute.

25:58.486 --> 26:02.949
You said I could come
on the first boat.

26:03.199 --> 26:06.825
You should wait
till the recon is gone.

26:07.076 --> 26:10.829
You want full coverage
of this landing, don't you?

26:11.038 --> 26:15.167
I must be in it. The all-American
girl saved from a yacht -

26:15.376 --> 26:18.879
- by "Deep Throat".

26:20.047 --> 26:25.095
- Don't print those, I'm married.
- Guaranteed to be on People Magazine.

26:25.303 --> 26:29.433
- Print just one.
- Really, Mr. Wilson...

26:29.684 --> 26:33.728
I need a break,
and you owe it to me.

26:33.937 --> 26:39.151
Because I am a holder of
a Petrox credit card. I really am!

26:39.402 --> 26:42.154
Ask your computer.

26:42.363 --> 26:48.533
<i>I may be late on my payments, but
you take 18% interest plus charges.</i>

26:48.783 --> 26:55.499
Dwan, you come ashore with us.
Captain, she'll come ashore.

26:55.749 --> 27:00.964
Good luck. As soon as you get
through, get on the horn.

27:05.509 --> 27:10.766
Hey, Jack? Maybe it's him.
Fred Wilson.

27:12.393 --> 27:17.024
I had my horoscope done
before I flew to Hong Kong.

27:17.232 --> 27:20.402
- It said that I was...
- Here you go.

27:22.236 --> 27:24.781
It said that I was going to cross
over water -

27:25.032 --> 27:28.657
- and meet the biggest person
in my life.

28:15.829 --> 28:22.003
That's interesting. The current is
18 degrees cooler than the air.

28:22.254 --> 28:27.511
- What does that mean?
- The fog might lift at the edge.

28:27.761 --> 28:31.890
Crossing 20 fathoms.
Shallowing rapidly.

28:36.436 --> 28:40.984
Standing up ahead.
I think I hear breakers.

28:58.291 --> 29:02.587
Shore boat to Explorer.
There's a curtain around the island.

29:02.837 --> 29:05.673
We just broke through.
There's a beach dead ahead.

29:05.923 --> 29:09.343
<i>In two words: No problem.</i>

30:11.029 --> 30:16.243
Let me get down! I haven't
touched the ground in weeks.

30:24.461 --> 30:27.214
That's good.

30:27.464 --> 30:31.843
Jack! I'm coming ashore.

30:32.052 --> 30:37.016
Wait, hold it. All right.

30:40.687 --> 30:43.436
Beautiful.

30:48.942 --> 30:54.282
Let's start getting a line on this
island. Bring the mosquito spray!

30:54.490 --> 31:00.746
We won't have to start wondering
which way to go.

31:00.955 --> 31:04.835
You want to start setting
seismic charges this morning?

31:05.085 --> 31:10.675
- Yes. Got to knock the stucture.
- All right, move out!

31:23.352 --> 31:26.689
There's a waterfall ahead!

31:26.939 --> 31:30.277
Last one to get in
is a rotten egg.

32:14.195 --> 32:17.699
Don't go running off anymore.

32:19.242 --> 32:22.246
We'll wait here for them.

32:25.583 --> 32:29.337
Just stick close by me, OK?

33:50.794 --> 33:57.510
Holy Mother!
That looks as old as the pyramids.

33:57.761 --> 34:04.014
Could be. But the pyramids
weren't repaired six months ago.

34:04.264 --> 34:10.438
There's earth on those timbers. It has
to be replaced after each monsoon.

34:10.688 --> 34:14.900
Are you telling me
there's people here?

34:15.109 --> 34:19.572
What's more, I'll characterize them.
Scared people.

34:19.781 --> 34:24.577
- Scared of what?
- I don't exactly what it is.

34:24.786 --> 34:31.043
But apparently, they thought
they needed a wall to keep it out.

34:31.252 --> 34:34.755
Let me straighten you out
on a couple of points.

34:34.964 --> 34:40.549
One: This wall is an ancient ruin.

34:40.801 --> 34:45.347
Two: The island is uninhabited.

34:53.813 --> 34:58.696
And three: There's an uninhabited
German beer hall in there.

34:58.946 --> 35:01.532
Let's go.

36:11.976 --> 36:17.566
Fred? Look down there.
Take your binoculars.

36:19.193 --> 36:23.406
- What?
- Down there, that pool.

36:34.125 --> 36:38.920
- Do you think it could be?
- The surface seems viscous.

36:39.170 --> 36:42.090
It sure as hell could be oil.

36:43.758 --> 36:47.972
Sweet Jesus! Rockefeller!

37:08.410 --> 37:13.331
- Maybe it's a wedding.
- A good guess.

37:13.582 --> 37:18.209
It's scheduled for the night
when the moon's full.

37:22.087 --> 37:25.258
Where's the groom?

37:33.977 --> 37:38.024
See the one
in the ape mask?

37:38.231 --> 37:43.111
You might say
that's the groom's stand-in.

37:43.361 --> 37:46.949
The groom is
on the other side of the wall.

37:47.199 --> 37:51.329
You mean it's bad luck if they
see each other before the wedding?

37:51.537 --> 37:54.079
Ghastly luck
for the whole congregation.

38:23.443 --> 38:25.863
Oh, Christ!

38:32.411 --> 38:35.411
You want to talk for us?

38:37.580 --> 38:40.334
I'll try.

38:40.542 --> 38:43.796
Shoot in the air only.

38:52.137 --> 38:55.059
What's he bitching about?

38:55.309 --> 39:00.982
He's probably telling us we've
contaminated their magic.

39:23.711 --> 39:26.381
No.

39:32.429 --> 39:36.016
Remember, in the air.

39:58.621 --> 40:01.081
What is it?

40:02.791 --> 40:07.005
He wants to make a deal.
Six of them for Dwan.

40:07.213 --> 40:10.967
Tell them that I like him, too,
but not that way.

40:13.971 --> 40:16.891
In the air!

41:44.022 --> 41:47.859
- You'll have trouble with the chief.
- I will buy the chief.

41:48.109 --> 41:51.776
What have we got
that wogs go for?

41:51.985 --> 41:56.698
Radios, pots and pans,
all sorts of junk.

41:56.948 --> 42:02.079
This is no longer the 19th century.
You can't just grab their island.

42:02.330 --> 42:05.248
I'll check that with the UN.
In the meantime -

42:05.457 --> 42:08.544
- we scare them into the boondocks
with a July 4th number.

42:08.794 --> 42:11.631
Are your men ready
to set the charges?

42:11.839 --> 42:14.133
Kong! Kong!

42:14.342 --> 42:18.972
You heard him chant.
He exists. You saw the wall.

42:19.181 --> 42:22.099
Who do you think they were planning
to give the girl to?

42:22.351 --> 42:28.354
It's some nutty religion.
A priest dresses up and gets laid.

42:28.604 --> 42:32.108
We'll humor Jack.
Take plenty of TNT.

42:32.317 --> 42:35.987
Any sign of a monkey bigger
than four feet, send it bang-bang.

42:36.196 --> 42:39.032
- You wouldn't.
- Bet me.

42:42.327 --> 42:49.294
Even you wouldn't be asshole enough
to wipe out a unique new species.

42:51.838 --> 42:56.385
The kids would burn every
Petrox gas station in the country.

43:09.146 --> 43:13.108
- He could be right.
- Kong, Kong, Kong...

43:15.902 --> 43:20.449
- What are you doing?
- I'm going to steal a boat.

43:20.699 --> 43:25.956
- Seriously?
- As soon as I've swiped supplies.

43:26.206 --> 43:31.168
- I'm going on a camera hunt.
- That sounds dangerous.

43:31.418 --> 43:36.591
It's a chance of a lifetime. You
either grab it or you're dead meat.

43:36.842 --> 43:43.891
You shouldn't go ashore tonight.
It's not a good night for Aries.

43:44.141 --> 43:47.475
How did you know I was an Aries?

43:49.561 --> 43:53.231
By the shape of your ears.

43:53.439 --> 43:59.029
All right, I asked Fred Wilson.
He knows everything about you.

43:59.280 --> 44:05.286
- I really wish you wouldn't go.
- Is it better to watch an old movie?

44:05.536 --> 44:07.998
There's nothing else to do.

44:08.248 --> 44:11.252
Use your imagination.

44:13.254 --> 44:17.885
80 times around the deck
is a mile. We could jog.

44:27.099 --> 44:32.313
I guess my camera hunt can wait
a couple of hours.

44:33.690 --> 44:38.819
Excuse me, I'll just finish stealing
in the galley.

44:39.028 --> 44:42.908
You'll disappoint me if you're here
when I get back.

44:43.158 --> 44:49.082
- What do you mean?
- I hope you'll wait in your cabin.

45:23.073 --> 45:27.537
Here you are, son.
Get it out right away.

45:27.787 --> 45:30.623
All right.

45:33.001 --> 45:37.798
I said that pool might be oil.
We can't be sure...

45:38.007 --> 45:43.846
Think positive. Guys who think
negative don't get far at Petrox.

45:44.096 --> 45:48.639
"Has to be the biggest ever.
No problems at all."

45:48.889 --> 45:55.188
- Well, you're the boss.
- Don't worry about it, Roy.

54:16.525 --> 54:18.944
Help!

54:22.698 --> 54:26.119
Help me!

54:36.339 --> 54:39.342
No!

55:25.846 --> 55:29.810
We're too late.
Set off the show.

56:11.519 --> 56:16.479
- Help him with that bolt.
- Cover the gate.

56:18.398 --> 56:22.153
Get on the other side!
Pull!

56:26.741 --> 56:29.995
Open that gate!

56:33.664 --> 56:38.712
The lights will hold him back!
Don't shoot.

57:06.321 --> 57:09.659
- He's taken her.
- No one's taken her.

57:09.909 --> 57:14.457
Who do you think went through
there, some guy in an ape suit?

57:20.129 --> 57:24.259
- You all right?
- I just fell in a Goddamn hole.

57:24.467 --> 57:28.846
No, you didn't.
You're not in a hole.

57:29.055 --> 57:32.056
That's a footprint.

57:47.864 --> 57:54.038
Carnahan here. We've gone over two
miles. There's still no sign of her.

57:54.289 --> 57:59.710
- It's better than finding remains.
- Unless he's gobbled her down.

57:59.918 --> 58:04.924
Give me that thing.
Most jungle apes eat only fruit.

58:05.174 --> 58:09.388
Most jungle apes don't have
a size-90 foot.

58:09.638 --> 58:13.138
The men have had it.
I'm going to pitch camp.

58:13.388 --> 58:16.392
Are you a bunch of old ladies?
Come on.

58:16.642 --> 58:19.228
Keep moving.

58:22.940 --> 58:26.028
Carnahan's right.
It makes more sense to stop.

58:26.236 --> 58:29.948
All right, Carnahan.
You know the drill.

58:30.198 --> 58:34.495
We'll plant seismic charges
for mapping and fire rockets...

58:34.746 --> 58:39.877
- Right, right!
- Will somebody be on the radar?

58:42.796 --> 58:49.219
Any large, furry blimp seen moving
in your direction, you'll know.

58:51.427 --> 58:56.683
That footprint measured 6.4 feet.

58:56.934 --> 59:00.979
If that were for real.
How high would that make him?

59:01.188 --> 59:05.567
Multiplied by about eight, I guess.

59:07.778 --> 59:10.531
He'd make a hell of a commercial.

59:10.823 --> 59:15.703
"The battles we at Petrox fight
to fill your tank."

59:29.840 --> 59:33.762
If he's not going to eat her,
why did he take her?

59:37.014 --> 59:41.895
Apes are very territorial.
He'll probably take her to his turf.

59:42.145 --> 59:44.439
What for?

59:44.648 --> 59:49.196
Joe said you said that the ape
was going to marry her.

59:49.446 --> 59:54.867
- Is that some kind of joke or...
- I don't know, Carnahan!

59:55.118 --> 01:00:00.624
I'm as ignorant as you. Quit asking
me so many dumb questions.

01:03:01.096 --> 01:03:04.266
I can't stand heights.

01:03:07.353 --> 01:03:14.401
Honest I can't. When I was ten I got
sick in the Empire State Building.

01:03:20.742 --> 01:03:24.163
Put me down!

01:03:28.497 --> 01:03:31.084
You put me down!

01:03:36.923 --> 01:03:41.053
You put me down!

01:03:43.472 --> 01:03:47.269
Put me down.

01:03:52.482 --> 01:03:56.070
Please put me down.

01:04:10.499 --> 01:04:14.253
You Goddamn chauvinist pig ape!

01:04:14.503 --> 01:04:18.966
What are you waiting for?
You wanna eat me?

01:04:19.216 --> 01:04:26.182
Then go ahaed! Do it!
Go ahead and eat me!

01:04:26.391 --> 01:04:30.770
Go ahead! Choke on me!

01:04:36.901 --> 01:04:41.949
I didn't mean that.
Sometimes I get too physical.

01:04:42.199 --> 01:04:47.327
It's a sign of insecurity,
like when you knock down trees.

01:04:50.164 --> 01:04:56.962
Such a nice ape.
Such a nice, sweet monkey.

01:04:58.547 --> 01:05:02.468
We're going to be great friends.

01:05:02.719 --> 01:05:09.351
I'm a Libra, what sign are you?
No, don't tell me.

01:05:09.601 --> 01:05:14.523
I'll bet you're an Aries.
Of course you are.

01:05:14.774 --> 01:05:18.110
I think that's just wonderful.

01:06:15.624 --> 01:06:18.627
Help me!

01:06:24.010 --> 01:06:26.220
Help me!

01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:19.024
Radar had him on the screen.

01:07:19.274 --> 01:07:26.236
3.6 kilometres west of your flare.
He moved in a random manner.

01:07:26.445 --> 01:07:30.992
- Not in our direction?
- Affirmative. Random. Like a circle.

01:07:31.201 --> 01:07:35.830
Maybe he's lost her. She got away
and he's searching for her.

01:07:36.081 --> 01:07:39.167
Carnahan! Wait a minute!

01:07:39.417 --> 01:07:43.798
<i>- Have you set seismic charges?
- The men are doing it now.</i>

01:07:44.006 --> 01:07:48.387
- Don't move until it's finished.
- He's nuts.

01:07:48.637 --> 01:07:54.477
The girl might be running for her life
from a gigantic turned-on ape.

01:07:54.727 --> 01:07:58.522
I know how you feel.

01:07:58.772 --> 01:08:01.439
But there's an energy crisis.

01:08:01.690 --> 01:08:06.319
We must all rise above
our self-interests.

01:08:06.528 --> 01:08:12.033
- You hypocritical bastard...
- Save your wind, he's signed off.

01:08:12.242 --> 01:08:14.703
Let's get going.

01:08:14.911 --> 01:08:18.165
I ain't busting my ass for no whites.

01:08:18.416 --> 01:08:24.339
OK. Who gives a shit that
the ape's headed in our direction?

01:10:40.057 --> 01:10:45.021
- There's Roy.
- Well, Fred...

01:10:45.229 --> 01:10:48.733
I finished testing the samples
from that pool.

01:10:48.983 --> 01:10:53.363
- It'll be real great oil!
- Son of a bitch!

01:10:54.823 --> 01:10:57.493
Fred Wilson is crazy, is he?

01:10:57.702 --> 01:11:02.581
Wait till those candy-asses
in New York hear about this.

01:11:02.831 --> 01:11:07.045
- I'll grind them...
- Like I said, it will be great oil.

01:11:07.253 --> 01:11:12.927
As soon as Mother Nature
finishes cooking it a little longer.

01:11:13.135 --> 01:11:15.550
How much longer?

01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:21.807
Hardly a tick of clock, in geological
terms. Say 10,000 years.

01:11:23.059 --> 01:11:29.232
Till then you'd get better mileage
filling your Cadillac with mule piss.

01:11:31.485 --> 01:11:34.153
Oh, my God!

01:11:35.949 --> 01:11:39.577
I hate to kick a fella when he's dead,
but I told you.

01:11:39.827 --> 01:11:44.959
You shouldn't have told New York
you were bringing in the big one.

01:11:48.295 --> 01:11:52.591
The big one. Jesus!

01:11:54.882 --> 01:11:59.596
Who says I ain't gonna?
Wilson to Explorer.

01:11:59.846 --> 01:12:03.600
Get me a channel to Surabaya,
I want an engineer drop.

01:12:20.702 --> 01:12:23.538
OK, Jack, you go first.

01:12:56.237 --> 01:13:01.827
- Come on, it's solid as a rock.
- OK, let's go.

01:13:17.966 --> 01:13:21.386
- Stop firing!
- Jack!

01:15:44.908 --> 01:15:48.328
Boan! Try to make it back.

01:15:51.287 --> 01:15:54.540
I'm going on.

01:16:24.406 --> 01:16:27.994
<i>All hands, stand by for recovery.</i>

01:16:47.094 --> 01:16:50.639
- Over and out.
- Recharge the batteries.

01:16:50.849 --> 01:16:55.186
- Air drop done, right on target.
- Perfect. Haul your asses.

01:16:55.395 --> 01:16:59.442
Get that equipment working.

01:16:59.650 --> 01:17:02.278
- You think I'm crazy?
- You said it.

01:17:02.486 --> 01:17:07.825
If I had found oil, Gulf, Shell, Exxon
would be crawling all over here.

01:17:08.034 --> 01:17:12.076
Not this one, pal.
Kong is all me and Petrox.

01:17:12.285 --> 01:17:18.042
A Fred S. Wilson exclusive.
Move your ass, Shorty.

01:17:22.171 --> 01:17:25.633
You think it'll ring the bell?
Promise oil, bring back a monkey?

01:17:25.841 --> 01:17:31.306
Look at Exxon's
"We'll Put a Tiger in Your Tank".

01:17:31.514 --> 01:17:36.979
Beach green to Carnahan.
Report back immediately.

01:17:37.188 --> 01:17:40.690
Do nothing to endanger Kong.
Acknowledge.

01:17:42.067 --> 01:17:47.323
Carnahan, do you read me?
Do you read me?

01:18:20.064 --> 01:18:23.735
Give us a hand over here.

01:18:29.445 --> 01:18:33.576
Wilson!
Still no contact with Carnahan.

01:18:33.784 --> 01:18:37.955
- The radio's not working. No sweat.
- I want to take out a search party.

01:18:38.163 --> 01:18:43.336
- I can't spare any men.
- Six guys are cut off in the bush.

01:18:43.545 --> 01:18:49.134
And you're building monkey traps.
You're playing with their lives.

01:18:49.342 --> 01:18:52.262
Don't worry about it.

01:18:58.185 --> 01:19:01.690
Boan!

01:19:05.109 --> 01:19:08.192
Where's the others?

01:19:47.943 --> 01:19:51.905
Come on, Kong, forget about me.

01:19:52.112 --> 01:19:57.786
This is never going to work.
Can't you see?

01:22:25.183 --> 01:22:27.852
Jack!

01:23:51.020 --> 01:23:53.941
We've got to do it.

01:23:54.149 --> 01:23:57.319
Are you ready?

01:24:24.344 --> 01:24:29.642
Radar update. Monkey spotted
1,800 yards west by north-west -

01:24:29.850 --> 01:24:35.190
<i>- heading 0-89,
velocity 2.2 miles per hour.</i>

01:24:35.398 --> 01:24:40.112
<i>Estimated time to your position,
five minutes or less.</i>

01:24:40.321 --> 01:24:44.325
Kill the lights.
Everybody clear out!

01:24:52.125 --> 01:24:58.424
- Logan, how are you doing?
- Almost finished. One minute more.

01:25:02.883 --> 01:25:07.347
- That's enough.
- All set, Mr. Bagley!

01:25:10.016 --> 01:25:14.521
- Ready, Boan?
- OK. It's hot now.

01:25:14.730 --> 01:25:19.902
Are you sure that monkey will
be able to bust through that gate?

01:25:21.613 --> 01:25:24.949
Pull back the bolt halfway.

01:25:32.081 --> 01:25:35.252
- Come on.
- I can't.

01:26:15.085 --> 01:26:18.417
Open the gate! Help!

01:26:20.671 --> 01:26:24.174
- Help!
- Jack!

01:26:25.759 --> 01:26:28.930
It's Prescott, open the gate.

01:26:45.781 --> 01:26:48.534
Come on!

01:27:02.754 --> 01:27:05.173
Close the bolt!

01:28:42.607 --> 01:28:46.486
Wilson, blow the Goddamn thing!

01:31:40.993 --> 01:31:44.539
Still want to play?

01:31:46.499 --> 01:31:50.629
Dwan! Congratulations.

01:32:02.808 --> 01:32:06.187
Hey, Jack.
Do I look different?

01:32:08.105 --> 01:32:12.899
- Yeah, you shine.
- That's right.

01:32:13.107 --> 01:32:16.028
- I'm a star.
- It's all set.

01:32:16.236 --> 01:32:22.201
Coast-to-coast tour. We open in
New York. Lights, cameras, Kong!

01:32:22.409 --> 01:32:25.621
And probably Nureyev and Fontaine.

01:32:25.829 --> 01:32:31.253
I want Balanchine to choreograph
"The Beauty and the Beast".

01:32:33.172 --> 01:32:36.050
Any chance of you two
getting married?

01:32:36.259 --> 01:32:41.180
I don't know.
This is so sudden.

01:32:41.389 --> 01:32:46.770
We could think of some nutty way
of Kong giving away the bride.

01:32:50.023 --> 01:32:57.111
It'd be tough to get him to do it.
Probably just old-fashioned, huh?

01:32:57.319 --> 01:33:02.033
I don't know.
What do you think, Jack?

01:33:11.294 --> 01:33:13.712
Christ.

01:33:17.008 --> 01:33:23.724
After all these years,
I'll finally end up with a shrink.

01:33:31.145 --> 01:33:34.982
How can I become a star
because of someone -

01:33:35.190 --> 01:33:40.572
- that was stolen off that gorgeous
island and locked up in that tank?

01:33:40.780 --> 01:33:47.203
It's not someone. It's an animal
that tried to rape you.

01:33:47.412 --> 01:33:52.001
That's not true.
He risked his life to save me.

01:33:52.209 --> 01:33:54.963
He tried to rape you, honey.

01:33:55.172 --> 01:33:59.468
Ask the natives what they thought
of losing Kong.

01:33:59.676 --> 01:34:03.972
- They'll miss him a lot.
- Like leprosy.

01:34:04.181 --> 01:34:10.769
You're dead wrong. He was the
terror, the mystery of their lives.

01:34:12.062 --> 01:34:16.984
A year from now, the island
will be full of burned-out drunks.

01:34:17.193 --> 01:34:21.446
When we took Kong,
we kidnapped their god.

01:34:25.409 --> 01:34:28.579
It's like there's a curse
on all of us.

01:34:28.788 --> 01:34:31.791
I'm tired of your trying to confuse
this girl.

01:34:31.999 --> 01:34:35.711
This is her big chance. And yours.
There's stars at Princeton -

01:34:35.920 --> 01:34:40.884
- just like in Hollywood. You want
me to get Kong another keeper?

01:34:41.093 --> 01:34:44.221
Coast-to-coast tours?
"Beauty and the Beast"? It's a farce.

01:34:44.429 --> 01:34:48.890
Just say the word and your contract
is torn up. Tell me right now.

01:34:53.936 --> 01:34:56.856
See you opening night.

01:35:09.662 --> 01:35:13.917
Oh, God,
I'm tired of thinking.

01:35:26.264 --> 01:35:31.308
- The ape had the right idea.
- What's that?

01:36:41.839 --> 01:36:44.969
Wait a minute.

01:36:48.344 --> 01:36:51.305
I'll be right back.

01:37:38.312 --> 01:37:41.772
<i>All hands on deck!</i>

01:37:46.362 --> 01:37:50.283
<i>Fire detail,
report to the control room.</i>

01:37:53.913 --> 01:37:58.041
<i>This is the captain.
Sea water pumps to full pressure.</i>

01:37:58.249 --> 01:38:02.880
<i>Prepare to flood tank No. 4.
I'm ordering the ape drowned.</i>

01:38:06.380 --> 01:38:10.719
Hey, Kong! Here I am.

01:38:16.266 --> 01:38:21.021
Do you remember me?
Remember your blind date?

01:38:21.229 --> 01:38:24.275
You haven't forgotten, have you?

01:38:32.992 --> 01:38:38.165
Dwan! Come back here!
He's going berserk.

01:38:38.374 --> 01:38:42.544
- Stop, or I'll jump.
- Dwan, please.

01:38:42.753 --> 01:38:47.338
- You can't help him now.
- Don't come any closer.

01:38:47.546 --> 01:38:50.091
OK.

01:38:52.718 --> 01:38:58.684
Hey, Kong? Why are you waking up
all these people?

01:38:58.892 --> 01:39:04.190
No one's going to hurt you.
You're just going to be a star.

01:39:13.284 --> 01:39:17.581
Don't flood the tank! She fell in.

01:41:25.747 --> 01:41:28.543
You could've...

01:42:29.856 --> 01:42:33.818
Jack! I'm so glad to see you.

01:42:36.781 --> 01:42:42.407
- What is it? You're not dressed.
- That's right.

01:42:42.616 --> 01:42:47.121
I was wrong when I called this
thing a farce, it's a tragedy.

01:42:47.330 --> 01:42:52.670
- I'm quitting your circus, Fred.
- You signed a contract.

01:42:52.878 --> 01:42:55.797
- You took an advance.
- I donated it in your name.

01:42:56.005 --> 01:43:01.471
To the SPCA Fund for Sending
Kong Home. Here's your receipt.

01:43:01.680 --> 01:43:06.601
- Sue me.
- Don't leave me tonight, please.

01:43:06.810 --> 01:43:10.940
- My horoscope says...
- Shut up. I love you.

01:43:14.859 --> 01:43:20.113
Come with me right now.
The hell with the contract.

01:43:20.321 --> 01:43:25.286
Go ahead. But I promise you
you'll never get another booking.

01:43:25.494 --> 01:43:29.455
You'll end up tap-dancing
at rotary clubs.

01:43:31.917 --> 01:43:37.131
- Don't you understand?
- Yeah...

01:43:37.339 --> 01:43:42.012
I do. Sorry.

01:43:44.639 --> 01:43:47.892
Stay well.

01:44:10.748 --> 01:44:14.585
<i>Ladies and gentlemen
of our TV-satellite audience, -</i>

01:44:14.793 --> 01:44:18.633
<i>- you are seeing this
live around the world- </i>

01:44:18.841 --> 01:44:24.513
<i>- as it is happening
here in New York City.</i>

01:44:24.722 --> 01:44:31.520
<i>You have better seats than these
lucky King Kong contest winners.</i>

01:44:52.665 --> 01:44:58.421
Thus, Beauty set foot on the
forbidden island and was seized.

01:44:58.630 --> 01:45:02.008
Great was the fear
as Beauty was lashed -

01:45:02.217 --> 01:45:07.265
- to the dreadful bridal altar
of the Beast.

01:45:07.473 --> 01:45:11.435
Now the earth booms.

01:45:45.595 --> 01:45:50.809
Kong's power!
Superpower!

01:45:52.853 --> 01:45:56.064
Hail the power!

01:46:29.264 --> 01:46:34.727
That's the power of Kong,
and Petrox!

01:46:46.738 --> 01:46:49.573
No! Don't push her around!

01:46:58.043 --> 01:47:01.880
Ladies and gentlemen,
there is nothing to fear!

01:47:02.089 --> 01:47:08.637
That is an escape-proof cage
certified by the city government.

01:47:32.410 --> 01:47:36.498
Come on out! Easy.

01:47:36.707 --> 01:47:40.376
His feet are still chained.

01:47:41.836 --> 01:47:45.799
It's all right. Come on.

01:49:44.502 --> 01:49:47.005
We're in position.

01:49:47.214 --> 01:49:52.049
The Queensboro Bridge is buttoned
up. What's the situation at Brooklyn?

01:49:52.258 --> 01:49:56.429
<i>I'll tell that monkey to spread
before he crosses it.</i>

01:49:59.098 --> 01:50:02.393
Come on, there's a train coming.

01:52:03.974 --> 01:52:06.518
Hit the lights.

01:52:22.162 --> 01:52:26.332
<i>This is a message to all traffic.</i>

01:52:26.540 --> 01:52:30.500
<i>Clear all streets.
Proceed to shelters.</i>

01:52:30.709 --> 01:52:38.176
<i>Repeating: Clear all streets. Any
person found looting will be shot.</i>

01:52:56.277 --> 01:52:59.155
Keep running.

01:52:59.364 --> 01:53:04.203
Jack! Buy me a drink, will you?

01:53:04.411 --> 01:53:07.332
Come on, buy me a drink.

01:53:07.540 --> 01:53:11.667
Ten more blocks and we've got
the key to a great apartment.

01:53:11.875 --> 01:53:14.795
We've put a river between us.

01:53:15.003 --> 01:53:19.424
The bridges are mined, and apes
don't swim. Your book says so.

01:53:19.633 --> 01:53:25.390
Please, buy me a drink.
Buy me a drink over there.

01:53:27.851 --> 01:53:30.187
OK.

01:53:33.565 --> 01:53:36.527
What's the matter?

01:53:36.735 --> 01:53:42.284
Déjà vu. I don't know where,
but I've seen this view before.

01:54:16.776 --> 01:54:19.945
Here.

01:54:20.154 --> 01:54:23.949
We don't want to get shot as looters.

01:54:24.159 --> 01:54:28.535
OK, get smashed.

01:54:28.744 --> 01:54:33.791
How about that nice offer
you made me? Do you still want me?

01:54:36.752 --> 01:54:42.759
Look, chinchilla.
Looks great on you.

01:54:42.967 --> 01:54:48.016
I asked you a question.

01:54:48.224 --> 01:54:52.062
- You know what I earn?
- Do you think I need furs?

01:54:52.270 --> 01:54:58.485
Yes. Excitement is in your blood
like dope.

01:55:00.195 --> 01:55:04.951
You're going to need new fixes
I'm not able to give you.

01:55:05.159 --> 01:55:08.493
Don't be stupid.

01:55:45.821 --> 01:55:48.616
It's OK.

01:55:50.535 --> 01:55:55.999
Probably some National Guardsman
ran his tank into a powerhouse.

01:55:56.207 --> 01:55:59.377
Do you remember that black-out?

01:55:59.586 --> 01:56:05.010
And all the babies born
exactly nine months later?

01:56:05.218 --> 01:56:10.056
Well, here's to all the future
sons and daughters of King Kong.

01:56:11.266 --> 01:56:14.312
I'll drink to that.

01:56:16.813 --> 01:56:23.571
The hell with furs. Tell me,
does that nice offer still stand?

01:56:25.361 --> 01:56:32.119
It depends on Kong. He's bigger
than both of us, know what I mean?

01:56:32.328 --> 01:56:35.122
Don't tease me, I'm serious.

01:56:41.045 --> 01:56:45.091
Of course. I know
where I've seen that view before.

01:56:58.356 --> 01:57:03.235
I think we've got a chance. Sit tight,
I've got to make a phone call.

01:57:04.651 --> 01:57:08.404
Keep it down, everyone.

01:57:08.613 --> 01:57:12.617
What do you think?
Is he flipped out or not?

01:57:12.825 --> 01:57:17.456
Hello? Hello...

01:57:17.665 --> 01:57:21.294
Excuse me, Professor. You say
you know where Kong is headed.

01:57:21.503 --> 01:57:25.131
Yes.
You can trap him without danger.

01:57:25.340 --> 01:57:29.804
Get some helicopters and
blasting nets on top of him.

01:57:30.012 --> 01:57:35.309
No problem. Where is he headed,
Professor Prescott?

01:57:35.518 --> 01:57:41.274
Promise me to capture him
without injury and I'll tell you.

01:57:50.447 --> 01:57:54.744
- Do we have a deal?
- Yes, Professor.

01:57:54.953 --> 01:57:57.454
Where is Kong heading?

01:57:57.663 --> 01:58:03.336
A place in Manhattan that looks
exactly like his natural habitat.

01:58:03.545 --> 01:58:07.883
Let him climb to the top of
the World Trade Center.

01:58:47.214 --> 01:58:50.134
Jack!

01:59:20.288 --> 01:59:25.253
He's coming down Fifth Avenue
on schedule.

01:59:25.461 --> 01:59:31.342
The power is back on.
Keep quiet, get in the shadows.

02:00:13.760 --> 02:00:16.138
No.

02:01:14.320 --> 02:01:17.030
Hold on! Close your eyes!

02:01:17.238 --> 02:01:21.495
The helicopters are coming
to net him!

02:02:06.540 --> 02:02:09.209
Hold on!

02:03:30.041 --> 02:03:32.794
Kong...

02:04:05.910 --> 02:04:10.666
What are those men doing up there?
Didn't they get my orders?

02:05:32.831 --> 02:05:35.457
The rotten bastards!

02:05:53.559 --> 02:05:59.983
He's still got the girl. Follow me
in a tight holding pattern.

02:06:20.877 --> 02:06:25.132
No! Don't put me down.

02:06:25.340 --> 02:06:29.137
Hold on to me.

02:06:31.556 --> 02:06:35.352
Hold on to me, or they'll kill you.

02:06:42.652 --> 02:06:45.196
Now!

02:06:52.868 --> 02:06:55.370
Oh, God.

02:07:11.054 --> 02:07:13.474
Wait.

02:07:21.316 --> 02:07:23.984
Hold on to me.

02:07:24.193 --> 02:07:28.113
Please don't let me go.

02:07:40.499 --> 02:07:42.876
Don't kill him!

02:07:45.546 --> 02:07:48.091
Don't kill him!

02:08:00.605 --> 02:08:03.441
Assholes!

02:09:08.839 --> 02:09:11.384
Kong.

02:11:00.284 --> 02:11:03.078
Dwan!

02:11:03.287 --> 02:11:05.999
Jack!

02:11:07.500 --> 02:11:10.587
Jack!
