WEBVTT

00:00.167 --> 00:02.127
[Mac] Previously on
Commander In Chief:

00:02.211 --> 00:04.838
This is Captain Andrew Duggan
of the USS Seattle.

00:04.922 --> 00:07.591
Our entire crew is now
safely aboard the USS Brighton.

00:07.674 --> 00:10.761
General, turn those ships
around and get our sailors home.

00:10.844 --> 00:11.845
[man] Yeah!

00:14.014 --> 00:17.267
I wanted to tell you all
how proud I am of you,

00:17.351 --> 00:19.186
of us, of this team.

00:19.269 --> 00:22.523
We accomplished something
amazing in the last 48 hours.

00:22.606 --> 00:27.110
I can't help but feel that, uh, there's
so much more we could accomplish.

00:27.194 --> 00:30.405
- You're going to run.
- This team deserves another four years.

00:33.367 --> 00:36.036
She's not gonna be easy to beat.

00:44.169 --> 00:47.214
[woman] Now that President Allen
seems to be taking the steps

00:47.297 --> 00:49.716
- to run for re-election next year...
- Excuse me?

00:49.800 --> 00:52.344
You disagree that she's
going to run, Mr. Speaker?

00:52.427 --> 00:55.305
Oh, run, yes. Absolutely.
But "re-election"?

00:56.056 --> 00:59.601
Fair enough. It's going to be great
to watch you run against each other.

00:59.685 --> 01:02.312
Yes, it will be her first
time at the top of the ticket.

01:02.396 --> 01:04.897
I don't want to disappoint you,
but for the moment,

01:04.982 --> 01:08.277
I'm just gonna focus on serving
the people of the Sunshine State.

01:08.360 --> 01:10.821
The rest is going
to have to take care of itself.

01:10.904 --> 01:12.656
Of course. So tell me,

01:12.739 --> 01:14.908
- you've seen her in action now.
- Mm-hmm.

01:14.992 --> 01:17.661
How would you rate
her first months in office?

01:17.744 --> 01:20.539
- Are there any... surprises?
- [chuckling]

01:21.248 --> 01:24.418
President Allen
never ceases to surprise me.

01:24.501 --> 01:25.919
She's a, um...

01:26.003 --> 01:29.339
...a steadfast leader.
And Mr. Calloway too.

01:29.423 --> 01:32.926
I've seen firsthand
how keen his decision-making can be.

01:34.094 --> 01:35.429
Strong.

01:35.512 --> 01:38.932
At every difficult moment,
he's there to back her up.

01:39.016 --> 01:41.143
Which is just another way of saying...

01:41.226 --> 01:45.355
It's another way of saying that it's
quite a deal the American people got.

01:45.439 --> 01:47.816
Two for the price of one.

01:47.899 --> 01:50.777
- [Templeton laughing]
- [TV clicks off]

01:50.861 --> 01:54.781
[sighs] Boy, what a piece of work.

01:54.865 --> 01:56.783
I don't know why you let him get to you.

01:56.867 --> 02:00.203
- It's not me I'm worried about.
- You're too sensitive.

02:00.287 --> 02:01.997
I am not too sensitive.

02:05.083 --> 02:06.668
[police siren wails]

02:08.961 --> 02:13.258
Tell me, when exactly did my
presidency turn into a timeshare?

02:13.342 --> 02:15.469
- What are you...?
- My California schedule.

02:15.552 --> 02:18.388
You and Dickie are selling me off
in five-minute blocks.

02:18.472 --> 02:21.558
- No one's selling your time, Mac.
- Really? Let's see.

02:21.642 --> 02:23.352
"POTUS..." that would be me,

02:23.435 --> 02:26.980
"...will be joined in limo
by businessman Caleb Kelban.

02:27.064 --> 02:29.858
On arrival to groundbreaking,
POTUS will be escorted

02:29.941 --> 02:32.319
by real estate developer, Mike Moeller."

02:32.402 --> 02:35.238
Ah, my personal favorite:
"POTUS will ride in elevator

02:35.322 --> 02:38.659
to suite with investment
banker Victoria Voles."

02:39.576 --> 02:42.371
I just hope,
for Ms. Voles' sake, it's a tall hotel.

02:42.454 --> 02:44.706
Well, it's a fundraiser, honey.

02:44.790 --> 02:47.084
Give your stump speech,
we eat baked Alaska,

02:47.167 --> 02:49.002
then we get back on Air Force One.

02:49.086 --> 02:50.337
Fine.

02:50.420 --> 02:53.840
But I'm gonna do more than just run
for president for the next two years.

02:53.924 --> 02:55.425
I wanna be president.

03:18.865 --> 03:22.035
Afternoon, everyone. Thank you.

03:22.119 --> 03:23.370
Speaker onboard?

03:23.453 --> 03:25.706
He's entertaining
the press pool in the back.

03:25.789 --> 03:27.666
That's perfect. Even on our plane.

03:27.749 --> 03:31.753
Kelly's monitoring. Speechwriting sent
a new draft for the groundbreaking.

03:31.837 --> 03:33.463
I'll review in the air.

03:33.547 --> 03:35.882
[Templeton] Harry Truman
had the right idea.

03:35.966 --> 03:39.970
Intimacy. A cross-country train.

03:40.053 --> 03:42.556
Standing on the observation platform,

03:42.639 --> 03:44.349
going through the back yards,

03:44.433 --> 03:47.728
going through the small towns
of this great country.

03:47.811 --> 03:51.690
Not flying over them like we do today.

03:51.773 --> 03:55.235
Not too late. We can still
drop you at Union Station.

03:55.318 --> 03:58.989
[chuckling] Welcome aboard,
Madam President.

03:59.072 --> 04:02.659
Thank you for this luxurious ride west.

04:02.743 --> 04:04.161
Not at all.

04:04.244 --> 04:07.581
I figure the groundbreaking
of the Bridges Presidential Library

04:07.664 --> 04:11.418
is a good time for the speaker
and I to find our own common ground.

04:11.501 --> 04:14.337
You care to comment
on this morning's USA TODAY poll?

04:14.421 --> 04:18.507
New numbers show you and the
speaker now tied among likely voters.

04:18.591 --> 04:21.595
Mr. Speaker, you running for something?

04:21.678 --> 04:22.763
Me?

04:22.846 --> 04:25.265
Yes. The door.

04:25.348 --> 04:26.808
[all chuckling]

04:42.073 --> 04:43.700
Are those numbers solid?

04:44.493 --> 04:46.536
And I can tell the first gentleman?

04:46.620 --> 04:49.998
I love you, Syndi Saltzman.
I wanna grow old with you. Have babies.

04:51.124 --> 04:53.668
- I look forward to meeting you too.
- Meeting who?

04:53.752 --> 04:56.755
- Syndi Saltzman.
- I must be getting old.

04:57.589 --> 05:01.301
I remember her father was the best PR
man in Sacramento. Ralphie Saltzman.

05:01.384 --> 05:04.304
Could spin anything.
Reporters called him the Dreidel.

05:04.387 --> 05:06.765
Well, what's the number, Dickie?

05:06.848 --> 05:07.891
Guess.

05:07.974 --> 05:10.602
Come on. I don't know. Uh... two?

05:11.728 --> 05:12.771
Three?

05:13.897 --> 05:17.818
- We're doing four?
- Point six. Four-point-six!

05:17.901 --> 05:19.528
- Million?
- Yes, doll. Million.

05:19.611 --> 05:21.822
That's not bad
for just getting our toes wet.

05:21.905 --> 05:24.199
Not bad at all. So they're all vetted?

05:24.282 --> 05:25.617
No known felons.

05:25.700 --> 05:27.702
Whoa, wait. I'm serious, Dickie.

05:27.786 --> 05:31.081
The president is not
exactly thrilled about doing this.

05:31.164 --> 05:33.875
Let's make sure we're doing it right.

05:37.879 --> 05:41.341
OK, there's officially
nothing to do in this house.

05:41.424 --> 05:43.051
You can help us.

05:43.134 --> 05:47.389
[grunts] Having your own movie theater
and bowling alley can be such a drag.

05:47.472 --> 05:51.351
It's not that. It's Friday night
and there's nobody to hang out with.

05:51.434 --> 05:54.396
- You kids could go out.
- Our friends are over the whole

05:54.479 --> 05:56.898
"being followed around
by men with guns" thing.

05:56.982 --> 05:59.442
Well, invite your friends here.

06:01.194 --> 06:02.988
That is a great idea, Grandma.

06:03.071 --> 06:06.283
- Oh, uh... wait a second.
- Just a few school friends.

06:06.366 --> 06:08.702
Yeah, just to hang out for a little bit.

06:08.785 --> 06:10.745
Can I invite some of my friends over?

06:10.829 --> 06:12.038
- No way.
- No.

06:12.122 --> 06:13.707
That's not fair. Grandma!

06:13.790 --> 06:17.210
- It's kind of a grown-up party.
- Not even. Just a couple of kids.

06:17.294 --> 06:20.046
We'll make our own fun.

06:20.130 --> 06:23.383
We'll watch lots of TV
and we'll order lots of pizza.

06:23.466 --> 06:25.010
- Pepperoni?
- Yes!

06:25.969 --> 06:28.430
- So, you sure this is cool?
- Absolutely.

06:28.513 --> 06:32.517
Maybe I should invite Stacy. She's been
bugging me to introduce the two of you.

06:32.601 --> 06:34.352
I can't imagine why, though.

06:34.436 --> 06:35.854
Thanks,

06:35.937 --> 06:38.231
- but I can handle my own love life.
- Whatever.

06:38.315 --> 06:41.860
It's been 200 years
since the White House burned down.

06:41.943 --> 06:44.029
Like to keep the streak alive.

06:44.112 --> 06:46.448
[chuckles] OK, Grandma.

06:49.868 --> 06:53.371
But no one building

06:53.455 --> 06:57.751
can contain the greatness of a man...

06:57.834 --> 06:58.877
Or a woman.

07:00.420 --> 07:03.256
- [chuckling]
- Oh.

07:03.340 --> 07:05.675
You ever think
about having your own library?

07:05.759 --> 07:07.928
Me? No.

07:08.011 --> 07:11.222
I do envy you, though.

07:11.306 --> 07:15.685
To have your work
all housed in one place.

07:16.811 --> 07:20.440
Your contribution
to American history on display.

07:20.523 --> 07:23.818
Oh, I think a good sturdy bookshelf
will do the trick for me.

07:25.153 --> 07:27.238
False modesty doesn't suit you.

07:28.531 --> 07:29.699
Nor you.

07:32.619 --> 07:36.957
I remember Teddy's first race,
the governor's mansion.

07:37.040 --> 07:40.126
It all happened so fast.

07:40.210 --> 07:43.922
They came to see him, the party elders.

07:44.005 --> 07:46.132
It was late, they needed a candidate.

07:46.216 --> 07:48.259
He was perfect...

07:48.343 --> 07:50.011
...on paper.

07:51.012 --> 07:52.889
But he didn't have the stomach for it.

07:53.890 --> 07:59.229
Used to talk to me
about running a campaign differently.

07:59.312 --> 08:02.273
About not doing
what he used to call the...

08:02.357 --> 08:04.275
...nasty stuff.

08:04.359 --> 08:08.321
The car rides, the handshakes.
The photo ops.

08:08.405 --> 08:11.074
I think maybe President Bridges
was onto something.

08:11.157 --> 08:13.159
Hmm.

08:13.243 --> 08:14.828
I like all that.

08:14.911 --> 08:18.039
This, this...

08:18.123 --> 08:20.083
...library...

08:21.209 --> 08:24.838
...it's just a parade they throw for you

08:24.921 --> 08:27.007
when you come back from the war.

08:27.090 --> 08:28.883
Me...

08:31.261 --> 08:33.763
...I love the war.

08:33.847 --> 08:35.682
[women talking]

08:37.475 --> 08:39.102
[chuckling] I love this plane.

08:39.184 --> 08:41.688
Greatest political tool ever assembled.

08:41.770 --> 08:44.941
- What are you doing here?
- It makes you sound powerful. Try it.

08:45.025 --> 08:47.027
"I just flew in from the East Coast."

08:47.110 --> 08:50.530
Or "I just flew in from the East Coast
on Air Force One."

08:50.613 --> 08:52.615
You're right. You do sound powerful.

08:52.699 --> 08:54.909
Dickie, meet Isabel Rios.
She's here to do...

08:54.993 --> 08:58.121
Why is it I have seven
unreturned phone calls into you?

08:58.204 --> 08:59.706
Eight, actually.

09:01.124 --> 09:05.378
If you want to get in touch
with someone like Dickie, you call me.

09:05.462 --> 09:07.047
- And you'll say no.
- Of course.

09:07.130 --> 09:08.923
Kelly likes to keep me to herself.

09:09.007 --> 09:11.551
- Dickie and I go way back.
- Fedman campaign. Ohio.

09:11.634 --> 09:14.804
- Your first win, right?
- You never forget your first.

09:14.888 --> 09:17.640
Final week of the campaign,
we have this in the bag.

09:17.724 --> 09:19.559
I mean, we're up nine, four days out.

09:19.642 --> 09:21.478
And for some reason I agree

09:21.561 --> 09:25.315
to let Isabel do a curtain raiser on our
GOTV strategy for the final weekend.

09:25.398 --> 09:28.068
Put her in the room with Fedman,
who is a little giddy

09:28.151 --> 09:29.944
at the thought of being governor.

09:30.028 --> 09:33.782
Tape recorder is rolling and he decides,
as the interview is wrapping up,

09:33.865 --> 09:36.576
to comment on Isabel's...

09:36.659 --> 09:38.745
- Breasts.
- Yes.

09:38.828 --> 09:41.247
I knew I had a bright future behind me.

09:41.331 --> 09:43.541
- But he won the race.
- Put me on the map.

09:43.625 --> 09:46.920
I was the guy who elected the guy
who talked about breasts on record.

09:47.003 --> 09:50.006
Why was he dumb enough
to talk about your...

09:50.090 --> 09:51.591
...you know...?

09:51.674 --> 09:54.677
- I was sleeping with him.
- Oh.

09:54.761 --> 09:55.804
I never knew that.

09:57.013 --> 09:59.474
How come I never knew that?

10:04.395 --> 10:05.897
What are you doing?

10:08.858 --> 10:11.778
I don't like using
the word "literally," but literally,

10:11.861 --> 10:13.780
my hand is in the cookie jar.

10:13.863 --> 10:15.615
You caught me.

10:15.698 --> 10:18.952
These may not be the best things
about Air Force One. They're close.

10:19.035 --> 10:22.497
I meant the interview.
It was a cheap shot. You know it.

10:22.580 --> 10:25.166
What do you mean?
I meant it. I mean, it's the truth.

10:25.250 --> 10:28.461
I think the president
is very lucky to have you by her side.

10:28.545 --> 10:30.964
Don't condescend to me, Nate.
It's beneath you.

10:31.047 --> 10:34.008
- Is it?
- Hmm.

10:47.814 --> 10:49.357
Not coming?

10:49.440 --> 10:52.735
Oh, I shoulda skipped
the chicken pot pie.

10:53.570 --> 10:56.656
The thought of riding
in a car makes me want to puke.

10:56.739 --> 10:59.200
I'm gonna... stay and rest.

10:59.284 --> 11:00.785
You sure?

11:00.910 --> 11:05.206
I'll be fine. I can work the phones
from here and catch up at the hotel.

11:09.836 --> 11:11.921
[kids chattering]

11:16.384 --> 11:18.928
[woman] All right. Ready. Remember.

11:19.596 --> 11:22.724
Big smiles, lots of waving.
Here she comes.

11:22.807 --> 11:23.933
Hi.

11:24.017 --> 11:26.186
Welcome to Orange County,
Madam President.

11:26.269 --> 11:27.520
- You must be Syndi.
- Yes.

11:27.604 --> 11:31.191
[children] Welcome to California.

11:31.274 --> 11:34.360
- Madam President, this is Caleb Kelban.
- My pleasure.

11:34.444 --> 11:37.197
He's a great supporter.
Thought he might ride with us.

11:37.280 --> 11:38.573
- We need to get going.
- OK.

11:38.656 --> 11:41.451
- This way.
- [child] Bye.

11:41.534 --> 11:43.828
[children] Bye, Madam President!

12:37.882 --> 12:42.262
After the national anthem, Lucy Bridges,
the president's niece, will read a poem.

12:42.345 --> 12:45.765
Speaker Templeton will make
brief remarks and introduce you.

12:45.848 --> 12:49.852
Two shovels and some pre-arranged
loose dirt will be stage right.

12:49.936 --> 12:52.772
After the speech,
you and the speaker will do the honors.

12:52.855 --> 12:56.484
Kelly will have the press pool
pre-positioned to make the shot.

12:56.567 --> 12:58.611
That's our picture of the day.

12:58.695 --> 13:00.822
The speaker and I flinging dirt?

13:00.905 --> 13:04.951
[chuckling] I was going for teamwork,
but the press is gonna eat it up.

13:05.034 --> 13:07.036
[man] Two minutes out, Madam President.

13:08.496 --> 13:11.708
To get right to the point, ma'am,
my jewelry stores have a contract

13:11.791 --> 13:14.794
with an African company
that exports rough-cut diamonds.

13:14.877 --> 13:17.714
Last year, the diamonds
were put under U.S. embargo.

13:17.797 --> 13:21.301
Caleb was one of the first to step up
when the trip was announced.

13:21.384 --> 13:22.844
Oh, it was my pleasure.

13:22.927 --> 13:26.306
Mr. Kelban, are you going
to ask me to waive the embargo

13:26.389 --> 13:28.057
for your specific company?

13:30.393 --> 13:32.895
You do have the power, ma'am.

13:35.315 --> 13:37.608
4,000 miles of wiring

13:37.692 --> 13:40.153
and 185 phones.

13:40.236 --> 13:42.989
- You just made those numbers up.
- Maybe.

13:43.072 --> 13:46.659
Still, it's the White House with wings.
Ultimate home-court advantage.

13:46.743 --> 13:49.579
A symbol of power and grace.

13:49.662 --> 13:51.331
Cut the sales pitch, Dickie.

13:51.414 --> 13:54.208
I already blew off the events.
What are we doing here?

13:55.126 --> 13:56.336
You tell me.

14:03.843 --> 14:06.471
Since when are you
friends with Richard Pachino?

14:06.554 --> 14:09.265
I just put his name on the list.
I didn't think he'd show.

14:09.349 --> 14:11.976
Who's gonna turn down
an invite to the White House?

14:12.060 --> 14:13.478
- Hey, you.
- Hi.

14:13.561 --> 14:15.480
I can't believe I'm in the White House.

14:15.563 --> 14:17.315
Dude, you don't have to whisper.

14:17.398 --> 14:20.109
- It's not a museum.
- Look around, dude. It sorta is.

14:20.193 --> 14:23.029
Yeah? Can't drink these in a museum.

14:23.112 --> 14:25.448
All right! How long
your parents out of town?

14:25.531 --> 14:27.533
Ah, they're back tomorrow.
But no ideas.

14:27.617 --> 14:30.536
- My grandma's here and we kinda...
- What about her?

14:30.620 --> 14:32.580
She's even worse.

14:32.663 --> 14:34.916
- Got it. No naked bowling.
- Definitely.

14:34.999 --> 14:36.876
But there is a bowling alley, right?

14:40.380 --> 14:43.132
[Amy] And one large pepperoni pizza.

14:44.092 --> 14:47.428
I don't want to order any
for Horace and Becca. They're mean.

14:47.512 --> 14:50.056
Oh, that's not true and you know it.

14:50.139 --> 14:53.559
Uh, make the pepperoni
with extra cheese.

14:53.643 --> 14:55.895
- Extra cheese, please.
- Good.

14:56.938 --> 15:00.650
- He wants to know where to deliver it.
- Here.

15:01.651 --> 15:03.653
Bring it to the White House.

15:04.862 --> 15:07.448
He wants to know which white house.

15:07.532 --> 15:10.284
Tell him the White House.

15:10.368 --> 15:13.162
The White House. That's where I live.

15:18.209 --> 15:20.586
Does this qualify
for the mile high club?

15:20.670 --> 15:22.755
Technically the plane was on the ground.

15:22.839 --> 15:24.257
I'm still claiming it.

15:24.340 --> 15:25.591
[chuckling]

15:25.675 --> 15:27.593
Oh, you're a button off.

15:28.719 --> 15:31.639
Don't think that this assures
the president a good piece.

15:31.722 --> 15:34.392
[man] This is Agent Downing.
Yes, sir, at my post.

15:34.475 --> 15:37.353
- [both clear throat]
- Angel is parked and shut down.

15:38.438 --> 15:40.231
Hold on, I'll confirm.

15:42.400 --> 15:44.277
Sir, White House has a guy on the line.

15:44.360 --> 15:48.322
Claims to be parked under the wing
of Air Force One. Says he has a bomb.

15:54.078 --> 15:56.914
- [Dickie] A fuel truck.
- [Downing] That's him.

15:56.998 --> 15:59.208
White House,
instruct the caller to wave.

16:07.633 --> 16:10.219
[police siren wails]

16:13.973 --> 16:16.851
[Mac] The groundbreaking was lovely.

16:16.934 --> 16:19.228
- Teddy would've been proud.
- Yeah.

16:20.021 --> 16:24.150
Upon arrival, Syndi has arranged for
the hotel staff to greet the motorcade.

16:24.233 --> 16:26.360
Why do I feel
like I'm working for her today?

16:26.444 --> 16:28.404
Well, we are.
But she's doing a good job.

16:28.488 --> 16:31.699
She knows that fundraisers contribute,
but hotel workers vote.

16:38.748 --> 16:40.666
[people chattering]

16:42.502 --> 16:44.712
- Mr. Gardner, pardon me.
- What is it, Pete?

16:44.795 --> 16:48.508
There's a situation developing
at the airport. Copy. Victory is secure.

16:48.591 --> 16:51.177
- What's going on?
- We need to abort public entry.

16:51.260 --> 16:53.930
- Rapid exit, straight to hold.
- Mind telling me why?

16:54.013 --> 16:55.765
Air Force One is being held hostage.

16:59.268 --> 17:01.854
[police siren blares]

17:07.318 --> 17:09.069
[tires screeching]

17:26.963 --> 17:28.130
What do we know, Pete?

17:28.214 --> 17:31.217
Approximately 37 minutes ago,
a man driving a refueling truck

17:31.300 --> 17:33.761
approached the secure perimeter
of Air Force One.

17:33.844 --> 17:37.974
Vehicle was on a pre-approved access
list, the individual was credentialed.

17:38.057 --> 17:42.061
He drove to left wing refueling position
and placed a call to the White House.

17:42.144 --> 17:44.897
- What does he want?
- He hasn't made a request yet.

17:44.981 --> 17:47.733
- We believe this threat is real?
- We have no other choice.

17:47.817 --> 17:50.736
The truck he's driving
carries 10,000 gallons of jet fuel,

17:50.820 --> 17:53.614
roughly the equivalent
of 140,000 sticks of dynamite.

17:53.698 --> 17:56.242
Not to mention thousands
of gallons in the plane.

17:56.325 --> 17:57.743
Fifty thousand, ma'am.

17:57.827 --> 17:59.912
Well, what do we know about the driver?

17:59.996 --> 18:02.248
We'll have a one-sheet
on him in 20 minutes.

18:02.331 --> 18:05.668
We don't know if this is just
the beginning of a coordinated effort.

18:05.751 --> 18:08.671
It would be our recommendation
that you cut your trip short.

18:08.754 --> 18:09.755
Where would we...?

18:09.839 --> 18:13.301
Edwards Air Force Base. We can be
wheels up for Washington in 50 minutes.

18:13.384 --> 18:16.262
I'd need at least one seat
on that plane for a wire reporter.

18:16.345 --> 18:18.347
- We could reschedule.
- Are you kidding?

18:18.431 --> 18:21.642
This is front row seating
to watch the president during a crisis.

18:21.726 --> 18:23.519
This is what they're paying for.

18:28.149 --> 18:30.234
- Twenty minutes for the one-sheet?
- Yes.

18:30.318 --> 18:32.320
All right. We wait for more information.

18:33.029 --> 18:35.948
But not because I'm afraid
to bruise the egos of some donors.

18:36.032 --> 18:38.618
I'm not gonna let some
nutcase chase me out of town.

18:38.701 --> 18:42.538
Well, let's do this favor
for Congressman Penmore, his district.

18:43.748 --> 18:45.291
So are we clear?

18:45.374 --> 18:47.627
- Yes, ma'am.
- You sure?

18:47.710 --> 18:49.670
That's six boxes of Peanut Butter Puffs.

18:49.754 --> 18:52.256
And two boxes of Vanilla Delights.

18:52.340 --> 18:53.674
They're for my kids.

18:53.758 --> 18:56.177
Thank you. Keep up the good work.

18:56.260 --> 18:59.639
- Thank you, Madam President.
- You're gonna run for re-election?

18:59.722 --> 19:00.890
You think I should?

19:00.973 --> 19:03.059
We like it more with a girl president.

19:03.142 --> 19:05.311
[chuckling] I'll see what I can do.

19:06.729 --> 19:09.982
- You know more than I do.
- [Kelly] There aren't lot of details.

19:10.066 --> 19:12.652
Do you have anything
from the Secret Service?

19:12.735 --> 19:15.905
- I don't think the agents like me.
- That's hard to believe.

19:15.988 --> 19:18.824
You're actually enjoying the fact
that I may get blown up.

19:18.908 --> 19:22.036
Our "cares about pollster" numbers
may take a short-term hit...

19:22.119 --> 19:24.330
Uh-uh. No. Not funny.

19:24.413 --> 19:26.916
The president's not
gonna cancel the fundraiser?

19:26.999 --> 19:29.001
- Keeping to her schedule for now.
- Good.

19:29.085 --> 19:30.378
- The press know?
- Not yet.

19:30.461 --> 19:32.171
Hell will break loose any minute.

19:32.254 --> 19:36.092
I've got Secret Service pulling together
fact sheets, security protocols.

19:36.175 --> 19:38.678
Good. Good. That's my girl.

19:38.761 --> 19:41.097
Make sure a photographer
is capturing it all.

19:41.180 --> 19:43.849
Black and whites
of the president handling a crisis.

19:43.933 --> 19:46.519
- Great campaign spot.
- You are sick.

19:46.602 --> 19:48.688
I'm serious. Keep me posted.

19:48.771 --> 19:51.399
- [phone beeping off]
- [exhales]

19:51.482 --> 19:53.609
Wanna go again?

19:56.696 --> 19:59.824
So my mom's sitting there
yelling, âStacy! Stacy!â

19:59.907 --> 20:01.617
It was so embarrassing.

20:01.701 --> 20:03.411
- What'd ya do?
- Whattaya think?

20:03.494 --> 20:06.539
Pretended not to see her
and ran out of the mall.

20:06.622 --> 20:09.542
Good one. Oh, here comes
my brother. Don't look.

20:09.625 --> 20:13.879
Lincoln's ghost? Like...
Like he, like, lives here, right?

20:13.963 --> 20:16.632
Yeah. Yeah. Go check it out.
Last room on the right.

20:16.716 --> 20:18.300
[Horace] Hey, but keep it down.

20:21.887 --> 20:23.889
Hey, uh, we haven't met.

20:23.973 --> 20:24.974
Stacy.

20:25.057 --> 20:26.767
Oh, you're Stacy?

20:27.727 --> 20:29.061
- I'm, uh...
- Yeah, I know.

20:29.145 --> 20:30.771
Got a beer for me?

20:30.855 --> 20:32.481
Yeah.

20:35.484 --> 20:37.820
[both chuckle]

20:41.741 --> 20:42.950
[Mac] You're on, Pete.

20:43.033 --> 20:45.494
[Pete] Our driver
is retired Major Frank Terzano.

20:45.578 --> 20:47.747
Born 1965, just outside of Ogden, Utah.

20:47.830 --> 20:49.957
Father was military,
stationed at the base.

20:50.040 --> 20:52.168
Moved around, 22 cities, 14 schools.

20:52.251 --> 20:55.755
Joined the Army, served in Desert Storm
where he earned a Bronze Star.

20:55.838 --> 20:57.339
Specialized in demolitions.

20:57.423 --> 20:59.508
There's a good chance this is for real.

20:59.592 --> 21:00.634
Yes, ma'am.

21:00.718 --> 21:04.889
He could have plastic explosives stolen
from military sources or even dynamite.

21:04.972 --> 21:07.641
It doesn't take much
to set off the jet fuel in his truck.

21:07.725 --> 21:11.103
- That's the real bomb.
- What's the rest of the situation?

21:11.187 --> 21:14.106
Perimeter is secured by FBI
and local SWAT teams,

21:14.190 --> 21:18.652
as well as Secret Service, counter
assault and emergency response teams.

21:18.736 --> 21:21.197
How was this man
allowed near Air Force One?

21:21.280 --> 21:23.282
Works for a private contractor

21:23.365 --> 21:26.952
that provides fueling services
to the U.S. military, fully vetted.

21:27.036 --> 21:29.121
It was our fault.
We should have caught it.

21:29.205 --> 21:30.623
Give me a moment.

21:30.706 --> 21:33.292
- What do you think?
- [Jim] Stick to the schedule.

21:33.375 --> 21:36.504
You said yourself, ma'am, can't be
chased away by a lone nutcase.

21:36.587 --> 21:39.006
Fundraising,
not negotiating Middle East peace.

21:39.089 --> 21:42.301
Happens to be fundraising,
tomorrow will be something else.

21:42.384 --> 21:44.804
Jim's right.
Your job is to keep to your schedule,

21:44.887 --> 21:47.389
not be distracted
by things outside your control.

21:47.473 --> 21:49.475
Let the Secret Service do their job.

21:49.558 --> 21:53.521
Collecting money at a time of crisis.
The press is gonna have a field day.

21:53.604 --> 21:57.399
OK. Have Syndi quietly gather
small groups, some of the organizers.

21:57.483 --> 22:00.653
- The rest of them will have to wait.
- Yes, ma'am.

22:00.736 --> 22:02.988
Ma'am, we now know
what Frank Terzano wants.

22:03.072 --> 22:05.533
[woman on TV]
...learned that Major Frank Terzano

22:05.616 --> 22:07.576
is threatening to blow up Air Force One

22:07.660 --> 22:11.163
unless he gets to speak directly
to the president of the United States.

22:15.584 --> 22:18.087
[talking plays in background]

22:23.926 --> 22:25.970
Where are you guys going?

22:26.053 --> 22:27.054
Shhh!

22:33.936 --> 22:37.189
I can't believe I'm walking
around the West Wing drinking a beer!

22:37.273 --> 22:39.525
[girls giggling]

22:39.608 --> 22:42.611
- Dude, you brought your beer?
- What? No good?

22:45.489 --> 22:48.617
Where does... that hall lead?

22:49.618 --> 22:51.620
One way to find out.

22:57.835 --> 22:59.879
Are you sure we're
supposed to be in here?

22:59.962 --> 23:01.964
Trust me, I know the owner.

23:02.965 --> 23:06.135
- So where are we anyway?
- You'll see.

23:11.682 --> 23:13.309
Wow.

23:17.813 --> 23:19.815
- Hey, Rebecca.
- Yeah?

23:19.899 --> 23:22.067
What would happen if I push that button?

23:22.151 --> 23:24.528
Mmm. That button?

23:24.612 --> 23:26.322
I don't know if I should tell you.

23:26.405 --> 23:28.866
Aw, come on. We won't say anything.

23:28.949 --> 23:31.368
You promise? OK.

23:31.452 --> 23:34.747
If you push that button,
a signal is beamed to a secret satellite

23:34.830 --> 23:37.708
that sends a code
to a special CIA computer

23:37.791 --> 23:40.169
that activates the launch sequence.

23:41.170 --> 23:43.464
- Like missiles and stuff?
- Mm-hmm.

23:43.547 --> 23:46.050
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

23:48.344 --> 23:50.512
It just turns on the light.

23:51.555 --> 23:52.973
[everyone laughing]

23:53.057 --> 23:56.810
OK, everybody. Press conference will
begin in two minutes, people. Come on.

23:56.894 --> 23:59.229
- Is it OK that we're in here?
- Yeah, it's cool.

23:59.313 --> 24:02.149
Mom's in California. So is Dad.

24:02.232 --> 24:04.276
So this is the only one, right?

24:04.360 --> 24:05.527
Oval Office?

24:08.238 --> 24:10.532
Actually, there's two.

24:11.575 --> 24:14.203
- One's a double for security.
- I knew it!

24:15.371 --> 24:16.956
Get me the Pentagon!

24:17.039 --> 24:19.541
[woman on phone] White House operator.

24:21.210 --> 24:22.628
[people shouting]

24:22.711 --> 24:25.005
Any truth to the rumor that you made out

24:25.089 --> 24:27.800
with Rusty Grife
in the back of Mr. Melvoy's class?

24:27.883 --> 24:31.470
The White House does not comment
on rumors started by Patti Layton.

24:31.553 --> 24:33.514
- Any other questions?
- [shouting]

24:33.597 --> 24:35.015
You had your question!

24:38.435 --> 24:40.479
I bet you can have any girl you want.

24:40.562 --> 24:43.399
No. It's not like that.

24:45.567 --> 24:48.737
Just don't tell anyone, OK?

24:52.157 --> 24:55.995
I'm walking off the plane. I'm gonna
wave nicely at the bomber over there.

24:56.078 --> 24:58.998
Then I'm gonna go to the airport bar
and have a gin and tonic.

24:59.081 --> 25:00.874
- I'm going too.
- Look at it this way.

25:00.958 --> 25:03.460
If you make us stay
and this nut sets this thing off,

25:03.544 --> 25:05.671
my family will sue your ass off.

25:05.754 --> 25:08.340
And if he doesn't,
I will spend the rest of my life

25:08.424 --> 25:11.760
telling everyone how you
held me hostage on Air Force One.

25:12.970 --> 25:15.597
- We've got a passenger coming off.
- Two passengers!

25:15.681 --> 25:18.017
Make that two. Male and female.

25:18.100 --> 25:21.812
Can someone alert the nutcase in the
fuel truck not to take it personally?

25:21.895 --> 25:23.605
Notify our snipers too.

25:23.689 --> 25:25.065
[man on radio] Right away.

25:25.149 --> 25:29.194
So let me understand this. We have half
of the Secret Service at the airport,

25:29.278 --> 25:31.030
FBI, SWAT teams,

25:31.113 --> 25:34.366
we have a spy satellite that can
read a license plate from space,

25:34.450 --> 25:36.618
and my source
of information is cable news?

25:36.702 --> 25:39.747
If the Chinese invade, am I
gonna hear it first on talk radio?

25:39.830 --> 25:41.540
I believe he called the media.

25:41.623 --> 25:44.585
Or a producer could have
gotten ahold of him on his cell phone.

25:44.668 --> 25:46.795
A technical coup
beyond our capabilities.

25:46.879 --> 25:48.547
We have hostage negotiators?

25:48.630 --> 25:50.424
- Are we talking to him?
- Yes.

25:50.507 --> 25:54.178
[woman] We have Frank Terzano on the
phone. Mr. Terzano, can you hear me?

25:54.261 --> 25:57.473
- [Terzano] It's Major Terzano.
- Major, what is it that you want?

25:57.556 --> 26:00.768
[Terzano] Simple. I want
to speak directly to the president.

26:00.851 --> 26:04.938
[woman] Are you threatening to blow up
Air Force One and everyone on board?

26:05.022 --> 26:07.232
[Terzano] I don't want to kill anyone.

26:07.316 --> 26:10.903
But I've tried and I've tried
and now they're gonna listen!

26:10.986 --> 26:13.655
I served my country for years.
This is how they treat us?

26:13.739 --> 26:16.617
They're just gonna let my wife die?

26:17.534 --> 26:20.412
She is down to 97 pounds.

26:20.496 --> 26:22.081
[radio static]

26:22.164 --> 26:24.875
[audio breaking up]
I am no... gonna let... happen.

26:24.958 --> 26:27.002
[woman] Mr. Terzano?

26:28.003 --> 26:30.506
Apparently,
we've lost contact with Mr. Terzano.

26:30.589 --> 26:32.966
- Is everyone off the plane?
- Process has begun.

26:33.884 --> 26:35.135
I don't believe this.

26:37.221 --> 26:38.972
[Mac] She stayed behind too?

26:40.849 --> 26:43.519
It was your idea to hire this guy.
Just remember that.

26:43.602 --> 26:46.313
Sharpshooters are in place
with a clear line of fire.

26:46.396 --> 26:47.439
It's an easy shot.

26:48.190 --> 26:50.359
He is wired, the whole thing blows.

26:50.442 --> 26:52.820
He's not threatening me. Just the plane.

26:52.903 --> 26:55.197
It's not an ordinary plane.

26:55.280 --> 26:59.618
You forget the cost.
That's got our flag painted on its tail.

27:07.084 --> 27:10.129
This guy has written letters
to everybody in the government,

27:10.212 --> 27:13.382
going back three years when the
VA cancelled his health insurance

27:13.465 --> 27:15.300
while his wife was in the hospital.

27:15.384 --> 27:18.971
"Dear congressman, dear senator,
dear secretary of Veterans Affairs."

27:19.054 --> 27:21.348
What a nightmare.

27:21.431 --> 27:24.518
I'm sure he got detailed,
prompt responses.

27:24.601 --> 27:28.647
Look, I want to know if this Terzano
character has a legitimate beef.

27:28.730 --> 27:31.150
- I want to know ten minutes ago.
- Does it matter?

27:31.233 --> 27:33.026
What if he is 100 percent right?

27:33.110 --> 27:35.654
He is getting railroaded
by bureaucrats in the VA.

27:35.737 --> 27:38.657
So what? Does that mean
he should take Air Force One hostage?

27:38.740 --> 27:40.742
Or that the president
should talk to him?

27:41.994 --> 27:44.663
Glad to see you two
are getting along better.

27:44.746 --> 27:46.999
Apparently, I have a schedule to keep.

27:47.082 --> 27:48.667
I want that report.

27:48.750 --> 27:51.587
Syndi knows the date
and I've written your office.

27:52.254 --> 27:54.214
A lot of important people will be there.

27:54.298 --> 27:57.676
I'm sure it'll be a memorable
bar mitzvah. Your wife must be excited.

27:57.759 --> 27:59.469
Oh, she is!

27:59.553 --> 28:02.014
My son's mother
will be there too, of course.

28:02.097 --> 28:03.724
Every effort will be made.

28:03.807 --> 28:05.475
You remember Cyrus Thompson,

28:05.559 --> 28:08.437
who was co-finance chair
for the Bridges-Allen campaign.

28:08.520 --> 28:09.688
How are you, Cyrus?

28:09.771 --> 28:11.690
Madam President, you look stunning.

28:11.773 --> 28:13.567
I know you have a lot on your plate,

28:13.650 --> 28:17.529
but these proposed sugar subsidy cuts
are going to be a disaster.

28:17.613 --> 28:20.407
We in agribusiness
are concerned about the timing of...

28:22.409 --> 28:24.203
[Templeton] Hell of a thing, Rod.

28:24.286 --> 28:26.205
[Rod] She's got it under control.

28:26.288 --> 28:29.041
[Templeton] There's a reason
this job ages people.

28:29.124 --> 28:30.876
What's the latest?

28:30.959 --> 28:33.378
Well, we're just getting
up to speed on the guy.

28:33.462 --> 28:36.632
It's two kids, wife sick,

28:36.715 --> 28:39.301
the VA cancelled his insurance.

28:39.384 --> 28:44.598
[chuckling] So naturally,
he holds Air Force One hostage.

28:44.681 --> 28:46.892
[Rod] He wrote your office.

28:46.975 --> 28:49.561
[Templeton] Everybody writes my office.

28:49.645 --> 28:50.812
What did we do?

28:50.896 --> 28:52.731
[Rod] Referred him back to VA.

28:52.814 --> 28:55.484
[chuckling]
Well, at least he got a response.

28:56.860 --> 28:59.446
Come on, Rod.
We get a thousand of these a month.

28:59.529 --> 29:01.240
More.

29:01.323 --> 29:02.783
I got a question for you.

29:02.866 --> 29:05.953
His wife has
some kind of cancer, Nathan.

29:06.036 --> 29:09.373
Now, we've reached out
to the doctor for more information.

29:09.456 --> 29:13.252
Now, my question is...

29:13.335 --> 29:16.505
...why is the guy
in the fuel truck still alive?

29:18.006 --> 29:20.133
They don't have a clean shot?

29:21.551 --> 29:23.929
Or is she afraid to give the order?

29:31.311 --> 29:33.814
So Stacy really thinks
there's two Oval Offices?

29:33.897 --> 29:36.275
I was just kidding her
and she believed me.

29:36.358 --> 29:39.444
- I don't know what to tell her.
- You think you'll see her again?

29:39.528 --> 29:42.864
Mrs. Allen! Horace! Rebecca!

29:43.949 --> 29:45.951
- Mrs. Allen.
- Where's Amy?

29:46.034 --> 29:47.369
[Rebecca] In bed.

29:47.452 --> 29:48.996
Did all of your friends leave?

29:49.079 --> 29:50.497
[Horace] They're gone. Why?

29:52.541 --> 29:53.834
Is there a problem?

29:53.917 --> 29:58.630
You are aware that one of the
five existing Gettysburg Addresses

29:58.714 --> 30:02.509
has been on display in the Lincoln
Bedroom since before you were born.

30:03.468 --> 30:05.470
Yes, Nora. May we help you?

30:05.554 --> 30:07.055
And now it is missing.

30:08.140 --> 30:09.349
I beg your pardon?

30:09.433 --> 30:11.977
The Gettysburg Address is missing!

30:12.060 --> 30:13.979
Nora, that's impossible.

30:14.062 --> 30:16.982
All of your friends here,
I never should have let it happen.

30:17.065 --> 30:18.567
Get it back!

30:24.906 --> 30:27.659
Didn't we start federal funding
of elections

30:27.743 --> 30:32.331
to prevent the kind of tawdry,
glad-handing I've done all day?

30:32.414 --> 30:36.918
May I introduce Dr. Bernard Hendricks?
He's the Terzano family physician.

30:37.586 --> 30:40.797
Mrs. President... President Allen,

30:40.881 --> 30:43.925
I've had Betty Terzano as a,
uh, patient for over ten years.

30:44.009 --> 30:47.929
About eight years ago, we discovered
a stage-one colon cancer. Very early.

30:48.013 --> 30:52.100
- Early discovery and treatment works?
- Yeah.

30:52.184 --> 30:56.188
Isn't that the point of me going through
that humiliating ritual every year?

30:56.271 --> 30:59.775
We were progressing in treatment
and she was responding and then...

30:59.858 --> 31:02.778
[exhales] ...Frank's veterans
healthcare was cancelled.

31:02.861 --> 31:04.029
Why?

31:04.112 --> 31:07.032
As best I can tell,
Frank Terzano was receiving VA benefits

31:07.115 --> 31:10.118
because he was classified
as more than 50 percent disabled

31:10.202 --> 31:12.454
when he was discharged
after Desert Storm.

31:12.537 --> 31:14.122
- Combat wound?
- No.

31:14.206 --> 31:16.958
He was, uh,
hit by a vehicle in a staging area.

31:17.042 --> 31:19.628
- A tank backed into him.
- A tank?

31:19.711 --> 31:21.213
Damaged his left leg.

31:21.296 --> 31:24.383
But he worked like hell in therapy
and he did all the right things.

31:24.466 --> 31:27.844
He improved, so he was reclassified
as only 30 percent disabled.

31:27.928 --> 31:31.473
Which dropped him out of priority one
coverage and he lost his insurance.

31:31.556 --> 31:34.434
Doesn't his current job
come with health insurance?

31:34.518 --> 31:37.896
For him. But not his wife
because of her pre-existing condition.

31:37.979 --> 31:39.398
- It gets worse.
- How?

31:39.481 --> 31:43.235
We found, when he did have insurance,
that she only responds well to Zorbitux.

31:43.318 --> 31:46.238
It's a... boutique, targeted drug

31:46.321 --> 31:48.740
that only works sometimes
when nothing else does.

31:48.824 --> 31:50.283
You said it gets worse?

31:50.367 --> 31:53.787
Zorbitux costs $17,000 a month.

31:56.998 --> 32:00.419
- Pete, I want to talk to Frank Terzano.
- [Pete] Yes, ma'am.

32:00.502 --> 32:04.297
You'll be secure on this end,
but his cell is potentially compromised.

32:04.381 --> 32:05.757
The least of our problems.

32:05.841 --> 32:09.428
Madam President, if I may, this has
the makings of a monumental blunder.

32:09.511 --> 32:12.431
You're outvoted, Jim.
The president's made up her mind.

32:12.514 --> 32:14.349
To negotiate with a terrorist.

32:14.433 --> 32:17.853
[phone dialing]

32:18.895 --> 32:21.022
[man] Madam President,
you have the line.

32:21.106 --> 32:24.609
[phone ringing, picked up]

32:24.693 --> 32:25.777
[Terzano] Hello.

32:25.861 --> 32:29.823
Mr. Terzano, this is the president
of the United States.

32:33.618 --> 32:35.620
I don't believe it. Prove it.

32:35.704 --> 32:38.874
No, Mr. Terzano, I don't need
to prove it. You need to listen.

32:39.916 --> 32:42.961
- I've met with Dr. Hendricks.
- You did?

32:43.044 --> 32:45.630
Did he tell you about my wife?
How sick she is?

32:45.714 --> 32:48.800
He's a very kind man.
He tried to help us, but he couldn't.

32:48.884 --> 32:51.470
Yes, I agree, he is a kind man,

32:51.553 --> 32:53.555
and he cares about you and your wife.

32:53.638 --> 32:57.559
I've also looked into your situation and
here's what I'm prepared to offer you:

32:59.769 --> 33:01.229
Absolutely nothing.

33:04.107 --> 33:05.567
Nothing?

33:05.650 --> 33:06.651
What do you mean?

33:06.735 --> 33:09.237
That's correct,
Mr. Terzano, absolutely nothing.

33:09.321 --> 33:10.989
I find what you've done outrageous

33:11.072 --> 33:13.825
and a complete abandonment
of the principals you upheld

33:13.909 --> 33:15.994
as a member
of the United States military.

33:16.077 --> 33:18.997
- I'm hanging up!
- Mr. Terzano, if you hang up,

33:19.080 --> 33:20.373
one way or the other,

33:20.457 --> 33:23.627
you will be dead very shortly
and your wife will be alone.

33:23.710 --> 33:26.254
Is this how you want
your children to remember you?

33:26.338 --> 33:29.925
Not as a man who served his country,
but a terrorist?

33:30.008 --> 33:32.344
I don't know what else to do.

33:32.427 --> 33:36.515
I'm supposed to take care of her.
Can you understand that?

33:36.598 --> 33:39.518
We tried everything. I let her down.

33:39.601 --> 33:42.020
- So this is my only option.
- [Mac] Mr. Terzano,

33:42.103 --> 33:45.357
you have not served
your country very well today.

33:46.107 --> 33:48.276
But there is reason to believe...

33:48.360 --> 33:51.446
...that you have not been well-served
by your country, either.

33:51.530 --> 33:55.867
If your country is at fault,
I promise to take the necessary steps...

33:55.951 --> 33:58.453
- I've heard all this before.
- Not from me.

34:01.790 --> 34:06.294
I can't keep letting her suffer. I need
guarantees that she'll get care and...

34:06.378 --> 34:08.880
This is not a negotiation, Mr. Terzano.

34:08.964 --> 34:10.966
This is a choice for you to make.

34:13.217 --> 34:17.138
Either you're willing to surrender
peacefully or this will end violently.

34:17.222 --> 34:20.058
If you care about your family,
as I believe you do,

34:20.141 --> 34:21.643
you'll save your life.

34:25.313 --> 34:28.233
It's your best hope, sir.

34:28.315 --> 34:30.944
And, frankly, it's your only hope.

34:31.027 --> 34:32.445
Good night.

34:32.529 --> 34:33.737
[phone clicks off]

34:33.822 --> 34:35.907
[dial tone]

34:38.994 --> 34:41.329
- Everyone off the plane?
- Yes, ma'am.

34:44.748 --> 34:47.502
Give him five minutes and then...

34:47.585 --> 34:49.670
...take your first clear shot.

34:52.090 --> 34:54.342
[Horace] No, dude, I'm not kidding.

34:54.426 --> 34:58.513
The Gettysburg Address was here when
the party started and now it's missing.

34:58.597 --> 35:01.099
What? I will kill you.

35:01.182 --> 35:02.767
[Nora] What? What happened?

35:02.851 --> 35:06.062
[Horace hanging up phone]
Alex. He says he put it on the Internet.

35:06.146 --> 35:07.939
[Nora] Internet? On the Internet?

35:08.023 --> 35:10.442
[Rebecca] He's kidding.
You know, it's a joke?

35:10.525 --> 35:12.277
[Nora] Well, it's not funny.

35:12.360 --> 35:14.988
[Rebecca] Hey, Stacy,
look, I'm sorry to wake you.

35:15.071 --> 35:18.408
You're not going to believe this,
but the Gettysburg Address...

35:18.491 --> 35:21.077
[Nora] Do you have any idea
what will happen to me?

35:21.161 --> 35:24.372
- [Kate] We will find it.
- [Rebecca] We need to get it back.

35:24.456 --> 35:27.917
[man] You are watching live footage
of a story we've been covering.

35:28.001 --> 35:30.795
Will retired Major Frank
Terzano surrender peacefully

35:30.879 --> 35:34.382
or will President Allen be forced
to give the command to shoot to kill?

35:34.466 --> 35:38.219
[Rod] This is all gonna happen live?
Can't these cameras be turned off?

35:38.303 --> 35:39.721
We're at four minutes.

35:39.804 --> 35:42.932
Command Center wants to know
if you will give the go order at five.

35:43.016 --> 35:45.477
[man] It comes down
to these tense moments.

35:45.560 --> 35:48.980
We now see the major
sitting in the cab of the fuel truck.

35:49.064 --> 35:50.315
Yes.

35:50.398 --> 35:52.734
[man on TV]
Now we can see inside the cab.

35:53.735 --> 35:56.363
It appears the sniper
is getting into position.

35:56.446 --> 35:59.658
We don't know if he's been
given the command to shoot.

35:59.741 --> 36:01.743
Hold on, hold on.
The cab door is open...

36:01.826 --> 36:03.244
Here we go.

36:04.079 --> 36:05.914
He's looking out the door.

36:05.997 --> 36:08.833
- Can you see his hands?
- [man] Affirmative on the hands.

36:08.917 --> 36:11.002
[man on TV] He's hesitating.

36:11.086 --> 36:13.004
Snipers have a clear shot, ma'am.

36:13.088 --> 36:15.256
Now, he's getting out of the cab.

36:15.340 --> 36:16.508
Don't shoot.

36:16.591 --> 36:18.927
...he's wired, no, he's climbing down.

36:22.430 --> 36:26.267
He's looking around.
Seems disoriented for some reason.

36:31.314 --> 36:33.566
- His hands are going up.
- Secure.

36:34.442 --> 36:36.945
Major Terzano
has surrendered without incident.

36:37.028 --> 36:39.030
[Jim] Well done, Madam President.

36:39.114 --> 36:41.199
[Pete] Congratulations, ma'am.

36:41.282 --> 36:44.536
You saved us
from flying back commercial.

36:44.619 --> 36:46.287
[Templeton chuckling]

36:47.372 --> 36:50.417
[man on TV] ...in cuffs...

36:52.627 --> 36:55.213
I speak for ten minutes
and then we are at the airport.

36:55.296 --> 36:56.881
Absolutely, Madam President.

36:56.965 --> 36:59.551
They couldn't be happier,
they're part of history!

36:59.634 --> 37:02.554
You're good at what you do, I know.
But I hate what you do.

37:02.637 --> 37:05.056
I understand totally,
but in this next election,

37:05.140 --> 37:09.018
the Republicans and the Democrats
will spend over $400 million each.

37:09.102 --> 37:11.187
We're coming away
with a little over four.

37:11.271 --> 37:13.606
You're good at what you do, too,
Madam President.

37:13.690 --> 37:15.984
But to keep you in office,
this is what it takes.

37:16.067 --> 37:18.570
I want a report
on what happened with the Terzanos.

37:18.653 --> 37:22.115
- Madam President, congratulations.
- What? Why? Who's responsible?

37:22.198 --> 37:24.576
I want a medical report
update on her condition.

37:24.659 --> 37:28.246
News is reporting offers of private
donations willing to cover her costs.

37:28.329 --> 37:30.457
How much will this increase our take?

37:31.458 --> 37:33.668
It's a historic night.

37:41.092 --> 37:45.138
[man] Ladies and gentleman,
the president of the United States.

37:45.221 --> 37:46.890
[applause]

37:52.020 --> 37:55.148
She's gonna win by ten points.
Write it down.

37:59.360 --> 38:01.362
[Rebecca] I haven't
reached Sara Taylor.

38:01.446 --> 38:05.158
Sara Taylor? No way.
She was terrified just being here.

38:05.241 --> 38:08.161
We have to tell the Secret Service.
Then the police.

38:08.870 --> 38:12.665
Then it's in the papers
and my life is over.

38:14.876 --> 38:17.295
Amy, darling. [chuckling]

38:17.378 --> 38:19.130
- [groans]
- Grandma.

38:19.214 --> 38:21.216
- What?
- What are you doing?

38:21.299 --> 38:23.593
Well, we've lost
something very important

38:23.676 --> 38:25.720
and we have been
looking for it all night.

38:25.804 --> 38:28.556
- Are you in trouble?
- We're dead.

38:32.519 --> 38:33.895
I hid it.

38:35.563 --> 38:37.607
What?

38:40.610 --> 38:42.195
Good one, Amy.

38:42.278 --> 38:44.280
I was up all night, you little sneak.

38:44.364 --> 38:46.449
I'm gonna make breakfast now,

38:46.533 --> 38:48.827
and we're gonna sit at the table

38:48.910 --> 38:52.330
and we're all going to talk
about how wonderful we are.

38:52.413 --> 38:54.374
- Pancakes?
- Eggs.

38:54.457 --> 38:56.459
- [Kate] Mmm.
- French toast.

38:56.543 --> 38:59.337
The president and
first gentleman will be here shortly.

38:59.420 --> 39:03.550
Well, I see no reason in the world why
we can't keep this our little secret.

39:03.633 --> 39:05.343
- Right?
- Sounds like a plan.

39:05.426 --> 39:06.761
[all] Yeah.

39:11.307 --> 39:13.393
[police siren wails]

39:17.438 --> 39:19.524
[Nora] I like having two Oval Offices.

39:19.607 --> 39:22.026
She just... she believed me.

39:22.110 --> 39:24.404
- Hey.
- Morning, guys.

39:24.487 --> 39:25.864
[Amy] Mommy!

39:25.947 --> 39:27.407
- [Nora] Good morning.
- Hey.

39:27.490 --> 39:28.867
Hey, Dad.

39:28.950 --> 39:31.035
Hi. Everything all right, Mom?

39:31.119 --> 39:32.370
We had a wonderful time.

39:33.872 --> 39:36.749
- Nora?
- Uh... just peachy!

39:37.709 --> 39:41.588
I've got to go check the seating charts
for the dinner. Oh, Mrs. Allen?

39:42.797 --> 39:43.798
Thank you.

39:48.928 --> 39:51.890
- Mom, you got any more pancakes?
- Of course.

39:52.765 --> 39:54.726
- Good morning.
- Vince.

39:54.809 --> 39:59.272
Ma'am, the secretary general asked if
he could move up your call 30 minutes.

39:59.355 --> 40:03.568
Then you have a pen and paper at 9:00
with U.S. News, Time and Newsweek.

40:03.651 --> 40:07.155
Kelly is drafting some talking
points about last night's situation.

40:07.238 --> 40:08.823
Uh, what... what situation?

40:10.825 --> 40:13.494
Nothing. Would you pass that syrup?

40:14.287 --> 40:15.246
Yeah.

40:15.330 --> 40:17.665
[Rod] So, what'd you guys do last night?

40:17.749 --> 40:19.792
[Horace] Uh, you know, nothing.

40:19.876 --> 40:20.877
[Rod] Hmm.

40:20.960 --> 40:24.297
[Rebecca] I was wondering
if Stacy and I could go into Georgetown.

40:24.380 --> 40:26.257
[Kate] Thought we'd go to the Corcoran.

40:26.341 --> 40:28.134
[Horace] The Wizards are in town.

40:28.217 --> 40:29.552
[Amy] Can I go shopping?

40:29.636 --> 40:31.220
[Kate] Uh, pass the syrup.

40:31.304 --> 40:33.097
[Horace] I was thinking we should go.

40:33.181 --> 40:35.183
Should be a pretty good game.
