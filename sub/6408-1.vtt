00:27.150 --> 00:29.730
Army Rangers have a proud history.

00:29.940 --> 00:34.070
Since the 1700s, Rangers have led
the way in every major confrontation...

00:34.150 --> 00:37.120
in which the United States
has been involved.

00:37.200 --> 00:41.540
You men are a credit to that fine
heritage, and I'm sorry to see you go.

00:41.620 --> 00:45.620
But you've served your country well,
and you've displayed the ability
to fight on...

00:45.710 --> 00:47.960
to the Ranger objective
and complete its mission:

00:48.040 --> 00:53.090
never leaving behind a fallen comrade
no matter what the odds or the enemy.

00:53.170 --> 00:54.800
I thank you.

00:54.880 --> 00:57.180
America thanks you.

00:57.220 --> 01:00.140
And I wish you luck wherever you go.

01:00.220 --> 01:03.890
And remember, Rangers lead the way.

01:12.360 --> 01:14.150
- Hi, Tricia.
- Hey.

01:16.990 --> 01:18.820
- Hey, Tricia Poe.
- Hello, Dale.

01:20.240 --> 01:23.290
How do I

01:23.370 --> 01:27.830
Get through one night
without you

01:27.880 --> 01:31.670
If I had to live
without you

01:31.750 --> 01:34.970
What kind of life
would that be

01:35.050 --> 01:38.510
Oh, I

01:38.550 --> 01:41.350
I need you in my arms
Need you to hold

01:41.430 --> 01:43.350
- Hummingbird.
- Hi.

01:43.430 --> 01:45.680
- You're my world, my heart and soul
- Look at you.

01:45.770 --> 01:48.690
I'd take a beatin' half my life
to get a piece of that woman.

01:48.810 --> 01:50.980
- How's my baby?
- She's doin' fine.

01:51.060 --> 01:54.530
- Baby, you would take away everything
- Yeah?

01:54.610 --> 01:56.990
- Good in my life
- What? You're kidding me!

01:57.070 --> 01:59.070
- What?
- Sweetie?

01:59.160 --> 02:02.580
Hey, shh. Can't you see I'm in
the middle of somethin' here? What?

02:02.660 --> 02:06.250
- How do I live without you
- You, you gonna be Miss Alabama?

02:06.330 --> 02:08.750
Well, that makes your daddy
very proud.

02:08.830 --> 02:14.420
Oh, I know
How do I breathe without you

02:14.510 --> 02:16.420
if you ever go

02:16.510 --> 02:19.720
Tricia Poe!
You little angel, you.

02:19.800 --> 02:22.470
Hey, how about joinin' me
and the boys for a cold one?

02:22.550 --> 02:25.390
- Huh, darlin'?
- No, thanks.

02:25.470 --> 02:27.390
Who's your
Captain Huckleberry here?

02:27.480 --> 02:30.770
-You know this gentleman, honey?
-He's a regular.

02:30.850 --> 02:35.110
Yeah, I'm a regular.
Huh. Regular hound dog.

02:37.690 --> 02:42.030
This is a special occasion, and
if you don't mind, I'd like to
spend it dancin' with my wife.

02:42.120 --> 02:46.620
Tell you what, soldier Dick. Why don't
you go buy me and my buddies a round?

02:46.700 --> 02:49.710
Hey, Cameron, no.
it ain't worth it.

02:49.790 --> 02:54.130
Hey. Come on, Daddy.
Let's dance.

02:54.210 --> 02:56.380
Oh, chickenshit!

02:56.460 --> 03:00.720
'Cause of pussies like you,
we lost Vietnam. I'll tell ya that.

03:00.800 --> 03:03.640
- We don't need trouble.
- Oh, you should be so proud.

03:05.390 --> 03:07.640
You know, for a second there
you were that guy again.

03:09.060 --> 03:10.440
I know it.

03:12.480 --> 03:17.030
Well, I was hopin' maybe the army
would make that guy grow up.

03:17.110 --> 03:18.780
Well--

03:18.860 --> 03:22.160
- He has.
- Then tell me now

03:22.240 --> 03:26.410
How do I live
without you

03:26.490 --> 03:29.370
I want to know

03:29.450 --> 03:33.710
How do I breathe
without you

03:33.790 --> 03:37.340
if you ever go

03:46.260 --> 03:48.180
Hey, Gomer!

03:48.270 --> 03:51.940
Thought you might need a little help
escortin' your old lady home.

03:55.900 --> 03:58.530
Cameron, let's go home.
Just get in the car.

03:58.610 --> 04:01.360
- Come on.
- Cameron!

04:02.360 --> 04:03.820
Cameron, get in the car!

04:09.580 --> 04:12.330
Dale! Dale!

04:25.300 --> 04:27.300
Take this,
you son of a bitch!

04:41.440 --> 04:44.400
Tricia!

04:44.490 --> 04:46.530
Tricia!

04:51.580 --> 04:54.750
God, he's dead.
Cameron, this guy's dead.

04:57.670 --> 05:00.250
Admit the facts,
and enter a plea bargain.

05:00.340 --> 05:02.300
I will not plead guilty.

05:02.380 --> 05:04.590
You could get ten years.

05:07.930 --> 05:11.600
Admit to it,
you get four.

05:11.680 --> 05:14.230
Serve maybe a year.

05:14.310 --> 05:19.730
Cameron Poe, you have pleaded guilty
to manslaughter in the first degree.

05:19.820 --> 05:22.730
With your military skills,
you are a deadly weapon...

05:22.820 --> 05:26.030
and are not subject to the same laws
as other people that are provoked...

05:26.110 --> 05:28.620
because you can respond
with deadly force.

05:28.700 --> 05:32.830
it is the order of this court that you
be remanded to a federal penitentiary...

05:32.910 --> 05:38.170
where you shall remain incarcerated
for a term not less than 7 to 10 years.

05:41.710 --> 05:46.590
"Con Air"
action-thriller, USA, 1997

05:47.340 --> 05:49.140
Hello, pretty girl.

05:49.260 --> 05:51.470
Come, come. Bring it here. Hey! Hey!

05:54.810 --> 05:59.690
Dearest Tricia, I think of you always.
Your smile, your laugh.

05:59.810 --> 06:03.650
I'm not angry. The blame's
gotta fall on me.

06:03.690 --> 06:07.360
I am, however, torn apart
when I think that I won't...

06:07.490 --> 06:10.030
be there to see our child
come into the world...

06:10.160 --> 06:13.120
cradled in your arms,
and her first smile.

06:14.870 --> 06:17.210
I got your package.
Those pink coconut things...

06:17.330 --> 06:19.670
have made me quite popular.

06:19.710 --> 06:24.630
Met a guy just the other day.
Baby-O. He sure does love 'em.

06:26.880 --> 06:30.180
And now our daughter, beautiful Casey.

06:30.220 --> 06:32.680
I watch her grow
in the pictures you send.

06:32.720 --> 06:35.520
I showed 'em to Baby-O.
His reaction was simple.

06:35.560 --> 06:38.190
He said, "Thank God
she looks like her mama.'

06:38.230 --> 06:40.690
I'd have to agree.

06:40.730 --> 06:44.480
It's funny, but here I am in maybe
the worst place on earth, and yet...

06:44.570 --> 06:47.030
somehow I feel like
the luckiest man alive.

06:53.870 --> 06:58.660
Dear Daddy, I started today at
the Little Sunshine Day Care Center.

06:58.750 --> 07:01.670
My teacher is Miss Gordon. She is nice.

07:01.750 --> 07:05.170
We go to playtime, and we all have
to hold hands when we walk there.

07:05.250 --> 07:08.420
Dear Casey, it was so good
to read your letter.

07:08.550 --> 07:10.510
I'm glad you like your teacher.

07:10.590 --> 07:13.050
We don't exactly have
a playtime like you.

07:13.180 --> 07:17.520
We do go outside, though. But
normally, we don't hold hands.

07:21.440 --> 07:25.230
My wife and I will have
our Margaritas on the yacht.

07:32.200 --> 07:35.410
Dear Daddy, today was
my first day at first grade.

07:35.450 --> 07:39.540
I didn't like it. I don't want
to go back tomorrow.

07:39.620 --> 07:44.130
This boy, Scotty Dalton, has
black teeth and calls me names.

07:44.250 --> 07:48.090
Mama says I have to go back.
Tell her not to make me.

07:48.130 --> 07:52.930
Dear Casey, hopefully this finds you
still goin' to the first grade.

07:52.970 --> 07:57.260
School is very important.
Your mama's right.

07:57.310 --> 08:00.480
Now, don't you worry
about little Scotty Dalton.

08:00.600 --> 08:04.400
Sometimes you meet people like that,
but don't let 'em get you down.

08:08.650 --> 08:13.110
Dear Daddy, are you ever comin' home?

08:13.240 --> 08:16.240
Dear Casey, of course I'm comin' home.

08:16.330 --> 08:19.620
ln just a little while longer, and all
the things we missed doin' together...

08:19.750 --> 08:21.750
you can be sure we'll do.

08:21.830 --> 08:26.290
Dear Hummingbird, break out
the fine china, chill the lemonade...

08:26.340 --> 08:28.630
tie a yellow ribbon
'round the old oak tree...

08:28.670 --> 08:32.630
'cause this boy's comin' home to
his ladies, comin' home forever.

08:32.760 --> 08:37.260
I just hope I'm not a disappointment
to Casey or to you.

08:37.350 --> 08:40.179
Love, Cameron.

08:40.270 --> 08:43.520
"My daddy is coming home
on July 14th.

08:43.600 --> 08:46.520
My birthday
is July 14th.

08:46.610 --> 08:51.030
I'm going see my daddy for the first
time ever on July 14th.""

08:51.110 --> 08:54.820
I can't wait to meet you, honey. lsn't
that the cutest thing you ever heard?

08:54.950 --> 08:56.990
Yeah, man.

08:58.660 --> 09:01.160
Hey, now,
what is this?

09:01.250 --> 09:05.420
I can't see my little daughter
on her birthday without bringin'
her a gift, now can I?

09:05.500 --> 09:07.880
Yeah, man,
but that's a bunny rabbit.

09:07.960 --> 09:10.250
That's all right. I mean,
she'll like it, right? I mean, what?

09:10.340 --> 09:13.840
it's either this or a tube
of toothpaste and two packs
of Pall Malls at the canteen.

09:13.920 --> 09:18.930
- Now, that's a present.
- I'll remember that on your birthday.

09:19.010 --> 09:21.310
Yeah, you do that, man.

09:26.190 --> 09:29.980
'it having been made to appear to
the United States Parole Commission...

09:30.070 --> 09:33.940
Cameron Poe is eligible
to be paroled.'

09:34.030 --> 09:37.870
Shit, might be a long time before I see
somethin' like that with my name on it.

09:44.710 --> 09:49.330
- You'll get your own date
someday, Baby-O.
- I ain't worried about that, man.

09:49.420 --> 09:53.010
Yeah, but like at this new prison you're
goin' to, who's gonna watch your back?

09:53.090 --> 09:56.300
God's got my back.
You know what I'm sayin'?

09:58.390 --> 10:00.640
I'm goin' home, son!

10:00.720 --> 10:03.390
Wait, don't be gettin' all juicy
on me, all right? Get off me.

10:05.270 --> 10:07.190
Step out.

10:10.520 --> 10:13.570
Good-bye. Good night.

10:21.740 --> 10:24.370
The U.S. Marshal Service
annually flies...

10:24.450 --> 10:27.710
155,000 prisoners
around the country...

10:27.790 --> 10:30.830
for transfers, legal hearings
and medical exams.

10:30.920 --> 10:34.920
As you know, today's flight
is a special one.

10:35.050 --> 10:38.380
We're populating Alabama's
Feltham Penitentiary...

10:38.470 --> 10:41.510
the newest super-max facility
in the system.

10:41.600 --> 10:44.850
This place was designed
to warehouse the worst of the worst.

10:44.930 --> 10:48.770
Now, most of these guys
are lifers, some on death row.

10:48.850 --> 10:52.860
Pure predators,
each and every one of them.

10:55.400 --> 10:58.570
- Hey, lady!
- Lady's a dog in a Walt Disney movie.

10:58.650 --> 11:01.110
My name is Bishop.
Guard Bishop to you.

11:01.240 --> 11:04.740
Well, I gotta be gettin' my shot
before we go gettin' on
some airplane, Guard Bishop.

11:04.830 --> 11:09.080
- What's your name?
- Odell. They didn't give me
my shot last night.

11:09.160 --> 11:13.960
Okay, you're diabetic? All
right, your insulin's on board.
We'll give it to you in flight.

11:15.130 --> 11:17.130
- Cameron Poe.
- Yes, ma'am.

11:17.210 --> 11:19.050
You know you're still under full
restraints till you're processed...

11:19.130 --> 11:21.260
and released from your original
prison, understand?

11:21.340 --> 11:24.600
Yes, ma'am. As long as I make it home
on time, it makes no never mind.

11:24.680 --> 11:27.470
- it's my daughter's birthday.
- Well, congratulations.

11:27.560 --> 11:31.560
I got locked down three months before
she was born. She ain't never seen me.

11:31.650 --> 11:34.020
- And why not?
- No way was she gonna meet her daddy...

11:34.110 --> 11:37.820
in a prison visitor room
surrounded by homemade cookies and...

11:37.940 --> 11:40.450
and love-starved murderers.

11:40.530 --> 11:44.910
- No way.
- What you got here is a walking,
talking reason to rehabilitate.

11:48.540 --> 11:53.460
So today let's exemplify
our three operative words:

11:53.540 --> 11:56.750
firm, fair and vigilant.

11:57.880 --> 11:59.630
Now, let's go to work.

11:59.720 --> 12:02.180
We off-load six in Carson City,
the rest are sheeted to Feltham.

12:02.300 --> 12:04.470
Good. Let's go deal
with the DEA boys.

12:08.720 --> 12:10.310
- You know this guy?
- Haven't had the pleasure.

12:10.390 --> 12:12.640
He's a piece of work,
a real piece of work.

12:14.230 --> 12:17.110
Duncan, good to see you.
She sure is beautiful.

12:17.190 --> 12:20.820
Hey, beautiful? Sunsets are beautiful.
Newborn babies are beautiful.

12:20.900 --> 12:22.950
This, this is
fucking spectacular!

12:23.030 --> 12:26.160
Duncan, this is Vince Larkin.
He's overseeing the transpo.

12:26.240 --> 12:29.330
Vince,
Duncan Malloy, DEA.

12:29.410 --> 12:33.120
Nice to meet ya. I'm sure
we're gonna have a good time
working on this together.

12:49.350 --> 12:52.180
- Hey, Willie.
- Boys!
- How ya doin'?
- What's up, Chief?

12:52.270 --> 12:54.770
- You know each other?
- Vince Larkin.
- Sims, DEA. Good to meet you, Larkin.

12:54.850 --> 12:56.770
This is our file on your man,
Francisco Cindino, son of Eduardo...

12:56.810 --> 12:58.440
prime mover of narcotics
from Colombia.

12:58.520 --> 13:01.610
it's gonna be
an all-star flight.

13:01.690 --> 13:04.280
This kid's a potential fountain of
information about the family business.

13:04.360 --> 13:06.410
- Eleven and a half okay?
- Yeah.

13:06.490 --> 13:08.740
Look at him.
Nice college boy, right?

13:08.830 --> 13:10.790
We interrogated him for months.
He gave up nothing.

13:10.830 --> 13:13.040
This is our last chance
before the FBl gets him.

13:13.120 --> 13:15.170
Over my dead body
those assholes get the glory.

13:15.250 --> 13:17.580
We pick up Mr Cindino
in Carson City.

13:17.670 --> 13:20.550
From then until the plane hits Alabama,
we've got two hours to get him to talk.

13:20.630 --> 13:22.550
We got you a seat right next
to him, and he's known to be...

13:22.630 --> 13:24.470
somewhat garrulous
in the company of thieves.

13:24.550 --> 13:26.590
Garrulous?
What the fuck is garrulous?

13:26.680 --> 13:30.600
That would be loquacious, verbose,
effusive. How about "chatty"?

13:30.680 --> 13:32.600
What's with dictionary boy,
here?

13:32.680 --> 13:35.690
Thesaurus boy, I think,
is more appropriate.

13:35.770 --> 13:37.860
- You got your gun?
- Yeah.

13:37.940 --> 13:40.690
- Whoa, whoa. Gun?
- We got rules, gentlemen.

13:40.770 --> 13:44.150
- Yeah. So do we. Our agents go armed.
- No one carries on this flight.

13:44.240 --> 13:46.490
I've got a small arsenal
in the belly of the plane.

13:46.570 --> 13:49.450
A pistol in the cockpit
lockbox. That's it.

13:49.530 --> 13:51.450
Other than that, we keep
the plane like a prison.

13:51.540 --> 13:53.540
No weapon
on the aircraft, period.

13:53.620 --> 13:56.210
My man does not get on
that plane without his gun.

13:56.290 --> 13:58.710
Then your man
doesn't get on the plane.

14:02.130 --> 14:04.340
Okay, Willie,
give it to him.

14:05.630 --> 14:07.630
Give him the gun.

14:14.310 --> 14:16.350
- Avoid eye contact.
- I got it.

14:16.440 --> 14:20.360
- ln the pen, it's a sign of aggression.
- Larkin, I got it.

14:20.440 --> 14:22.520
Okay.

14:24.740 --> 14:27.150
Foxtrot Charlie,
we are ready to disembark.

14:27.240 --> 14:30.700
Waiting your go
on separatee transfer.

14:30.780 --> 14:33.490
Well, we told you today's flight
would be special.

14:33.580 --> 14:37.000
- That's William Bedford,
aka "Billy Bedlam.'
- The mass murderer?

14:37.080 --> 14:40.330
The same. He caught his wife in bed
with another man. Left her alone.

14:40.420 --> 14:43.420
Drove four towns over
to his wife's family's house.

14:43.500 --> 14:45.760
Killed her parents, her brothers, her
sisters, even her dog.

14:45.840 --> 14:47.550
Scan him.

14:47.630 --> 14:50.090
And who is that
good-looking brother on screen?

14:50.180 --> 14:53.100
Nathan Jones,
aka "Diamond Dog.'

14:53.180 --> 14:55.560
Former general of
the Black Guerrillas.

14:55.640 --> 14:58.020
He blew up a meeting of the National
Rifle Association saying...

14:58.100 --> 15:01.730
and I quote, "They represented the
basest negativity of the white race.'

15:01.810 --> 15:05.860
He wrote a book in prison called
Reflections ln A Diamond Eye.

15:05.940 --> 15:08.450
New York Times called it "A wake-up
call for the black community.'

15:08.530 --> 15:11.200
They're talking to Denzel
for the movie.

15:21.710 --> 15:23.710
Close door number one.

15:26.380 --> 15:28.380
This one's done it all.
Kidnapping...

15:28.470 --> 15:30.880
robbery, murder,
extortion.

15:30.970 --> 15:34.260
Foxtrot Charlie, perimeter is secured.
You are cleared to release.

15:36.390 --> 15:40.770
His name is Cyrus Grissom,
aka "Cyrus the Virus.'

15:40.850 --> 15:44.270
Thirty-nine years old,
25 of them spent in our institutions.

15:44.360 --> 15:48.110
But he's bettered himself inside. Earned
two degrees, including his Juris Doctor.

15:48.190 --> 15:52.990
He also killed 11 fellow inmates,
incited three riots and escaped twice.

15:53.070 --> 15:55.530
Likes to brag that he killed
more men than cancer.

15:55.620 --> 15:57.370
Okay, open wide.

15:57.450 --> 15:59.290
Lift your tongue.

16:01.870 --> 16:06.340
Cyrus is a poster child
for the criminally insane. He's
a true product of the system.

16:06.420 --> 16:10.420
What's that supposed to mean? Uh, what
is he, one of these sociology majors...

16:10.510 --> 16:12.970
who thinks we're responsible
for breeding these animals?

16:13.050 --> 16:16.140
No, but I could point a few fingers
if it would make you feel comfortable.

16:26.360 --> 16:29.780
Ah, look at this walking penis.
Boy, you are one skinny Negro.

16:29.860 --> 16:32.200
- Easy man. Shit.
- Open up.

16:32.280 --> 16:34.700
Oh, man, it smells like
somebody shit in your mouth.

16:34.780 --> 16:36.700
He told me he loved me.

16:36.780 --> 16:39.620
- Get out of my face.
- All right, all right. Shit.

16:44.290 --> 16:47.000
- Hey, Larkin, who's that guy?
- That is Cameron Poe.

16:47.090 --> 16:50.550
A parolee hitchin' a ride home.
He's a nobody.

16:51.420 --> 16:53.590
Okay, let's do it.

16:53.680 --> 16:57.890
Willie, nobody on the plane knows
your classification, not even my guards.

17:00.350 --> 17:01.890
- Guard Bishop.
- Hey, Larkin.

17:01.980 --> 17:04.020
Tell me, Skip, is
the U.S. Marshal Service...

17:04.099 --> 17:07.060
in the habit of employing
annoying, wiseass bookworm creeps?

17:07.150 --> 17:08.770
Larkin's one of the best
we got.

17:08.900 --> 17:12.319
Yeah, well, I'd still like to
crush his larynx with my boot.

17:15.359 --> 17:17.450
Scan him.

17:17.530 --> 17:19.240
Face me.

17:22.700 --> 17:26.079
- What's this shit?
- it's my daughter.

17:26.170 --> 17:27.880
I don't care if it's
the weepin' mama of Christ.

17:27.960 --> 17:29.960
There's no personal possessions
on this airplane.

17:30.090 --> 17:32.510
Just as long as you know I'll be
gettin' that back at some point.

17:32.590 --> 17:35.430
Are you tellin' me what I'm
gonna be doin' here, numb-nuts?

17:35.510 --> 17:37.430
- You heard me.
- Hey, hey, hey.

17:37.510 --> 17:39.430
Come on,
break it up.

17:42.520 --> 17:46.730
Oh, now, look at this fashion statement.
The do-rag gotta go, homeboy.

17:49.150 --> 17:51.940
- Right here.
- Attention, officers.

17:52.030 --> 17:55.900
- Final check, all restraints.
- Sweet bird of freedom.

17:55.990 --> 17:58.120
Take off
in three minutes.

17:58.200 --> 18:02.450
What's up, man?
Oh, shit. What's up?

18:02.540 --> 18:04.910
I thought you was someone else.
Pinball Parker.

18:05.000 --> 18:09.500
Armed robber, arsonist, dope fiend. I'm
a hell of a nice guy. I just got caught.

18:09.630 --> 18:12.670
Aw, shucks.

18:17.510 --> 18:20.010
- All right, face me.
- I got him.

18:20.140 --> 18:22.140
Come on.

18:24.220 --> 18:26.140
Open.

18:33.820 --> 18:35.820
You guys are late
for the party.

18:35.900 --> 18:38.660
- Okay.
- Let's go, sweetheart.

18:44.370 --> 18:46.370
What's up, Cochise?

18:46.500 --> 18:48.710
How?

18:48.830 --> 18:51.130
Hey, man, I'm just fuckin' with you,
all right? Don't get all...

18:51.210 --> 18:54.090
"Wounded Knee" on me
and shit.

18:56.220 --> 18:58.090
You look like
you wanna scalp a nigger.

19:00.340 --> 19:03.180
What you lookin' at,
punk?

19:03.260 --> 19:06.890
Nothin'. I was just
admirin' your cage.

19:06.980 --> 19:08.890
Fits you pretty good.

19:10.770 --> 19:13.690
Well, welcome aboard.

19:13.770 --> 19:16.400
My, my. As I look around I see
a lot of celebrities among us.

19:16.530 --> 19:21.530
I see 11 Current Affairs,
two Hard Copies, and a genuine
Geraldo interviewee.

19:21.620 --> 19:23.950
But I got to tell you,
gentlemen, none of this impresses me.

19:24.030 --> 19:27.200
Because we have rules on this aircraft,
and they're gonna be enforced.

19:27.290 --> 19:29.830
it's a lot like kindergarten.
You'll keep your hands to yourself.

19:29.920 --> 19:33.710
You keep the decibel level down.
And if any of you should feel
the need to scream...

19:33.790 --> 19:36.550
spit or bite,
you get the treatment.

19:36.630 --> 19:39.590
- Fuck you, pig.
- Gag and bag this Nazi muffin.

19:42.680 --> 19:44.720
See, this kind of thing
puts me in a foul mood.

19:44.810 --> 19:48.020
These rules will be enforced.
if there's a hint of trouble...

19:48.100 --> 19:52.350
if any of you so much as passes
gas in my direction, it offends
my delicate nasal passages...

19:52.440 --> 19:56.940
your testicles will become
my personal property.

19:57.070 --> 20:00.650
That's pretty clear.
Good.

20:19.720 --> 20:22.800
Call me Johnny 600
if they knew the truth.

20:22.970 --> 20:26.510
Ah, doesn't have
quite the same ring to it.

20:26.600 --> 20:29.270
Anyway,
I despise rapists.

20:29.390 --> 20:32.230
For me, you're somewhere between
a cockroach and that white stuff...

20:32.310 --> 20:35.690
that accumulates at the corner of
your mouth when you're really thirsty.

20:35.770 --> 20:38.400
But in your case,
I'll make an exception.

20:39.940 --> 20:42.950
- Guard Falzon.
- What?

20:43.030 --> 20:47.450
Oh, stewardess, stewardess?
What's the in-flight movie today?

20:47.530 --> 20:49.200
Well, I think you'll like it,
Cyrus. it's called...

20:49.290 --> 20:51.580
I'll Never Make Love
To A Woman On The Beach Again.

20:51.660 --> 20:56.250
And it's preceded by the award-winning
short, No More Steak For Me Ever.

20:58.800 --> 21:00.550
Funny fucker,
aren't ya?

21:04.470 --> 21:07.970
Hope this goes smoothly.
All those monsters on one plane.

21:08.100 --> 21:10.310
Please, Ginny,
this is a well-oiled machine.

21:10.430 --> 21:13.770
The only thing we gotta worry about is
stale peanuts and a little turbulence.

21:16.520 --> 21:18.940
Close forward gate.

21:31.750 --> 21:34.290
Close middle gate.

22:18.170 --> 22:19.840
Come on,
I need my shot!

22:19.920 --> 22:23.130
Coming. I'm coming.
Left arm.

22:38.270 --> 22:41.230
Hey, Chief, if you come
through this all right...

22:41.320 --> 22:43.980
hope you don't hold
a grudge.

22:44.070 --> 22:46.400
What the fuck
are you doin'?

22:51.780 --> 22:54.750
Get the extinguisher.
Open the middle gate.

22:54.870 --> 22:57.000
The Last Mohican
is burnin', man!

22:58.960 --> 23:02.590
Shit. Did you see that motherfucker,
man? He spontaneously combusted.

23:04.630 --> 23:08.260
He's a fuckin' witch doctor, man.
I seen that shit on Discovery Channel.

23:08.300 --> 23:11.090
- Code red! Code red!
- Chantin' and shit.
- Fire in the rear cabin.

23:11.220 --> 23:15.890
- I've got a fire.
- Where is it?
- She's reporting it in the rear cabin.

23:15.970 --> 23:19.520
At first I thought he was singin'
Y.M.C.A. Then the flames.

23:19.600 --> 23:21.690
Sh-Shit!

23:33.620 --> 23:36.080
Holy shit!
Hold on, Bobby!

23:37.540 --> 23:39.500
Gimme a Taser!

23:41.920 --> 23:44.710
Hey, man,
get off my insulin!

23:46.630 --> 23:49.220
Bobby, open the door!
Open the goddamn door!

23:54.260 --> 23:57.060
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

23:59.560 --> 24:02.810
Pinball, go!
Pull the lever. Go! Go!

24:05.980 --> 24:07.940
Pinball, behind you!

24:10.530 --> 24:13.320
Get the gun out of the lockbox,
Mack. Go on back there, check it out.

24:26.000 --> 24:27.670
Go! Go!

24:42.770 --> 24:46.610
-Oh, my God.
-Say there was a disturbance
but everything's under control.

24:46.690 --> 24:48.360
Say it,
or I will kill you.

24:48.400 --> 24:50.650
Without me, you got nobody
to fly the plane.

24:50.740 --> 24:53.320
I never think
that far ahead.

24:55.070 --> 24:57.580
All right, I'm doin' it.
Just take it easy.

24:57.700 --> 25:00.910
And if you say a word about this over
the radio, the next wings you see...

25:01.040 --> 25:05.250
will belong to the flies buzzing
over your rotting corpse.

25:07.250 --> 25:08.670
Uh, Carson City.

25:09.670 --> 25:11.170
Hey! Hey!

25:17.260 --> 25:21.600
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your captain speaking.

25:21.730 --> 25:24.020
I have the only gun
on board.

25:24.100 --> 25:26.360
Welcome to Con Air.

25:35.450 --> 25:38.120
- What happened?
- Roger that, Carson City.

25:38.240 --> 25:41.120
Calm down, Vince. Just a little ruckus,
and the pilot hit the alarm.

25:41.250 --> 25:42.910
Just a little ruckus?

25:42.960 --> 25:44.580
Pilot just checked in.
Everything's fine.

25:44.620 --> 25:49.130
Transponder's confirmed,
and there's your baby.

25:49.250 --> 25:51.710
Damn, this pig
is heavy!

25:51.800 --> 25:53.720
Oops.

25:58.300 --> 26:00.100
Shit.

26:00.140 --> 26:02.140
if we let you out,
you gonna play nice, Billy?

26:02.270 --> 26:04.390
Probably not.

26:11.650 --> 26:13.990
I got a spot on my arm
just for you.

26:14.110 --> 26:15.780
Hey, man, yo. Come on,
get off my medication.

26:15.820 --> 26:18.280
I'm sorry, man.
The shit's in my way.

26:18.320 --> 26:21.620
- I'm gonna use your whole body
to make me feel good.
- All right here, man. Come on.

26:21.660 --> 26:23.620
All right, man.
Stop rushin'.

26:30.340 --> 26:32.130
Ah, yeah.

26:34.670 --> 26:39.300
No, no. Oh, no!
Make me hurt you.

26:41.680 --> 26:44.100
- What you doin'?
- I can't allow that.

26:46.520 --> 26:48.940
- You know what I am?
- Ugly all day.

26:51.440 --> 26:54.360
This ain't happenin',
not here, not now.

26:54.440 --> 26:56.320
- Oh, it's happenin'.
- Hey!

26:56.360 --> 26:58.820
Relax. He's right.
Not here and not now.

26:58.860 --> 27:01.280
- Do you fly, Johnny?
- No.

27:01.370 --> 27:03.160
You keep that in mind
when you look at her...

27:03.290 --> 27:05.660
because if your dick
jumps out of your pants...

27:05.790 --> 27:07.830
you jump out
of this plane.

27:15.130 --> 27:18.680
What are the numbers in Carson City?
How many on, how many off?

27:20.470 --> 27:24.010
- Six off and ten on.
- Find the six.

27:24.140 --> 27:26.980
Well, I know three of these brothers.
Th-They right back there.

27:27.060 --> 27:30.020
Uh, the other three are
Benson, Carls and Popovitch.

27:30.060 --> 27:34.400
- Where are they?
- That's a damn good question,
Cyrus. And I'm gonna find out.

27:34.530 --> 27:36.740
The pilot wants to know
what's next.

27:36.860 --> 27:39.570
He's to land at Carson City
Airport as scheduled.

27:39.700 --> 27:43.370
Carson City? The law is down
there. You lost your mind?

27:43.410 --> 27:47.580
According to my last
psych evaluation, yes.

27:47.700 --> 27:49.580
Diamond Dog,
if you would.

27:51.920 --> 27:56.760
You think you're free?
You're not. Now, listen up.

27:56.880 --> 28:02.050
Forty to 50 U.S. prison guards
armed with shotguns are waitin'
for us at the next stop.

28:02.090 --> 28:05.260
Now, if you do exactly
what we tell ya...

28:05.390 --> 28:09.230
the rest of our lives will be a vacation
in a non-extradition country.

28:09.270 --> 28:14.400
I'm talkin' sandy beaches,
umbrella drinks...

28:14.520 --> 28:16.900
and dirty, naked freaks.

28:16.940 --> 28:19.780
it'll be a paid
motherfuckin' vacation.

28:21.280 --> 28:23.120
Wait. Who's doin'
the payin'?

28:23.240 --> 28:25.870
Our employer,
Francisco Cindino.

28:29.120 --> 28:33.210
Everybody freeze. Oh, no. No,
no, no, no, no, Cyrus. No, no.

28:33.290 --> 28:34.880
Get that ass out here
right now!

28:34.960 --> 28:37.000
- With you in a second.
- Right now!

28:37.090 --> 28:39.550
- Keep cool, boss.
- Shut up.

28:39.630 --> 28:42.340
- Who the fuck are you?
- I'm DEA. That's who the fuck I am.

28:44.260 --> 28:47.510
- Now you were saying?
- Oh, that's very clever, Cyrus.

28:47.600 --> 28:50.600
So you think I give a shit
about that little bitch guard
you have there right now?

28:50.680 --> 28:54.230
Well, maybe you didn't hear what
I said. I'm DEA. You know what
the fuck that means?

28:54.310 --> 28:56.730
- Y-You the most crooked nigger
on this plane.
- Shut up.

28:56.820 --> 29:00.440
You're DEA? What are you doin'
on this flight? Won't
they fly you boys commercially?

29:00.570 --> 29:04.030
Don't push me, Cyrus, man.
I swear to God, I'll blow away
your little boyfriend right now.

29:04.110 --> 29:07.080
You know, the next time
you choose a human shield...

29:07.160 --> 29:10.000
you're better off not pickin'
a two-bit Negro crackhead.

29:10.080 --> 29:11.750
- Hey!
- Shut up.

29:11.830 --> 29:14.710
- Shoot him.
- Quiet, sweetheart.

29:14.790 --> 29:18.130
- I think you should just stop.
- Stay back, man.

29:18.210 --> 29:20.760
- Stay back!
- Just stop, right?
Before somebody gets killed.

29:20.840 --> 29:23.760
- Back!
- All right, cowboy, I'm back.

29:23.840 --> 29:27.720
- Stay back.
- You know you're in a situation
you can't control, right?

29:27.800 --> 29:30.430
I can't control it?
I can't control it?

29:30.520 --> 29:33.100
- You're a dead man.
- Shut the fuck up!

29:54.250 --> 29:56.170
What's your name,
convict?

29:57.500 --> 30:00.130
- My name?
- Yeah.

30:00.210 --> 30:04.680
- Poe.
- Nice work, Poe. Truly nice work.

30:11.560 --> 30:13.600
Nice goin', son.

30:13.680 --> 30:16.310
Not only did you not save
this dude's life...

30:16.400 --> 30:20.150
you done made best friends
with Cyrus the damn Virus.

30:20.230 --> 30:24.190
Hey, Cyrus, I, uh, I got some good news
and I got some bad news.

30:24.320 --> 30:28.700
-Yeah, what's the good news?
-Well, the goods news is I found
Benson, Carls and Popovitch.

30:28.780 --> 30:30.950
- What's the bad news?
- The bad news is...

30:31.030 --> 30:34.160
this dead fellow right here
happens to be Benson.

30:34.250 --> 30:37.500
This Aryan fellow with the bullet hole
in his forehead is, is Carls...

30:37.580 --> 30:42.210
and, and this honky
he's draggin' in is Popovitch.

30:42.300 --> 30:45.880
I don't know how to tell
you this, Cyrus, but we are
three white guys short.

30:46.010 --> 30:49.260
Or as they say in ebonics,
"We be fucked.'

30:50.430 --> 30:53.270
Look man,
I just wanna know.

30:53.390 --> 30:57.560
All right, you didn't-- You
didn't mean that dirty-nigger
crackhead shit, did you?

30:57.600 --> 30:59.350
Gimme that gun.

30:59.440 --> 31:01.520
Hell, yes, I meant it.

31:01.610 --> 31:05.360
Listen, Carson City is expecting
six men to get off this plane...

31:05.440 --> 31:07.360
and we're gonna give 'em
exactly what they expect.

31:07.450 --> 31:10.700
- So I need three volunteers.
- Come on, let's go, son.

31:13.620 --> 31:15.910
- Don't look at me, pal.
- What about her?

31:16.000 --> 31:19.330
I'm servin' eight consecutive
life sentences. I am not
getting off this plane.

31:19.420 --> 31:22.040
I got my insulin, all right, but
they broke all the damn needles.

31:22.130 --> 31:24.340
if I don't get my shot
in the next couple of hours...

31:24.420 --> 31:26.380
- somebody gonna be sending
flowers to my mother.
- Hey, I'll go.

31:26.470 --> 31:29.010
- I'm too old for his shit.
- I mean, no offense.

31:29.090 --> 31:32.050
- I can take care of myself.
- I can see that.

31:32.140 --> 31:34.720
Go ahead, go to the back.
Anybody else?

31:34.810 --> 31:38.350
- Hey, right here, man. Us two.
- Great, go ahead. Go to the back.

31:42.440 --> 31:45.900
Hey, whoa, stop. The guys
they're expecting are white.

31:45.980 --> 31:48.030
That puts you
shit out of luck.

31:48.110 --> 31:50.490
- Hey, come on, man.
- I'll tell you what. Sit down.

31:50.610 --> 31:54.620
One of my associates will bring
you a phone book, and you call
the Affirmative Action office.

31:54.700 --> 31:58.160
- You, go ahead.
- Yeah, that's it.

31:58.290 --> 32:02.290
- I'm gone, man. I'm dead in two hours.
- No.

32:02.380 --> 32:04.840
I'll get off,
scream to high heaven.

32:04.960 --> 32:07.460
This plane won't leave
Carson City.

32:10.720 --> 32:14.350
We need another white boy
to volunteer.

32:14.470 --> 32:18.560
- Pilot's white.
- Wait, wait, wait. The pilot?

32:18.680 --> 32:24.230
- Who's gonna fly the plane?
- Relax, Billy. Welcome to the machine.

32:24.360 --> 32:28.820
- You rang?
- Carson City says we got a hell
of a sandstorm down there.

32:29.700 --> 32:31.660
Perfect.

32:33.240 --> 32:34.700
Crazy.

32:40.710 --> 32:43.880
Vacant cell D8,
ready for inspection.

32:46.750 --> 32:48.840
Last tenant,
Cyrus Grissom.

32:48.920 --> 32:52.010
Got scratches on the wall.
Probably a weapon sharpening.

32:52.130 --> 32:55.220
- What about the loose shelf screw?
- What the hell is this?

32:55.300 --> 32:57.260
Looks like cocaine.

33:01.730 --> 33:05.610
- What, do you got something there?
- I don't know. it's all soft.

33:10.320 --> 33:12.400
What about the rest
of the pigs?

33:12.490 --> 33:16.950
Be patient, now. They haven't
ceased to be useful yet.

33:16.990 --> 33:19.580
Okay, old man.
Now you're Mr Popovitch.

33:19.660 --> 33:23.330
Gentlemen, you'll reach the
Nevada pen in about two hours.

33:23.460 --> 33:25.670
The tape's just a little
precaution in case any of you...

33:25.790 --> 33:30.170
are rocked by the sudden impulse
to squeal like a pig.

33:30.300 --> 33:34.130
Not that we don't trust you.
But let's face it, you're criminals.

33:36.350 --> 33:39.260
- Come on, man, move your head up.
- I want to stay on.

33:39.350 --> 33:40.970
What?

33:42.020 --> 33:43.850
I changed my mind.

33:43.980 --> 33:47.150
So, Cyrus, we got
a little mind-changer.

33:47.190 --> 33:50.530
I got 15 years left, and
I know I'd just hate myself...

33:50.650 --> 33:53.610
if I thought I blew my one shot
at a naked party freak...

33:53.700 --> 33:56.110
and, and
an umbrella drink.

33:56.200 --> 33:59.490
You got 15 years? Boy, a second ago
you couldn't wait to get off this plane.

33:59.540 --> 34:03.290
I know.
Fear of freedom, I guess.

34:06.710 --> 34:10.130
Get him up.
Get the cuffs off him.

34:10.170 --> 34:13.469
Pick out a guard, and then put that
dead cop's prison issues on him.

34:15.380 --> 34:18.139
- What the hell are you doin'?
- Stayin'.

34:18.219 --> 34:21.060
They're gaggin' everybody
for the bus ride to the pen.

34:21.179 --> 34:24.639
it'll be hours before the Feds discover
what happened. By then you'll be dead.

34:24.730 --> 34:30.150
- So will she.
- Poe, think of your little girl.

34:30.230 --> 34:34.699
Now, what would my daughter
think of me if I left you like
this to get dishonored and die?

34:34.739 --> 34:37.659
You keep acting like you're still
a Ranger, we're all gonna be in trouble.

34:37.739 --> 34:40.870
You're not that guy anymore.
You're a convict.

34:45.210 --> 34:47.370
Dear God!

34:49.170 --> 34:52.590
- Told you I'd get that back.
- Fuck you, trailer trash.

34:52.710 --> 34:57.180
Hey, my mama lives in a trailer. Now
put those on. I just saved your life.

34:59.890 --> 35:02.220
Okay, soldier boy.
You got a plan?

35:04.100 --> 35:06.060
Maybe.

35:20.530 --> 35:24.240
Chief? I got a lot
of weird shit down here.

35:24.290 --> 35:26.710
- What is it?
- This looks like the drawing
of a plane.

35:26.790 --> 35:30.880
- Whose cell is that?
- The Virus.

35:57.320 --> 35:58.950
Open up!

36:15.000 --> 36:17.760
My daughter's picture. Where'd
you put my daughter's picture...

36:17.840 --> 36:20.760
you shit-eatin'
peckerhead?

36:30.480 --> 36:32.770
Heard you had a problem
up there.

36:32.810 --> 36:37.480
Had to bag 'em and gag 'em.
Rough crew. Spitters and shitters.

36:42.990 --> 36:46.290
On the bus, dickhead!
On the bus!

36:59.090 --> 37:00.800
Let's go.
We're at the gate.

37:06.930 --> 37:10.640
They took the plane. You hear that,
boys? We got the plane, man.

37:10.680 --> 37:14.020
Shut the fuck up, curly, all
right? You gonna get us caught!

37:14.150 --> 37:16.610
No way, Jose!

37:16.690 --> 37:19.320
You gotta be kiddin' me.

37:19.360 --> 37:21.650
Oh, boy.

37:24.660 --> 37:28.830
ln Spanish from Bogota, Colombia.
Looks like it's from a law firm.

37:43.880 --> 37:46.850
Orange and black.

37:48.720 --> 37:50.970
What's up, man?

37:51.060 --> 37:53.350
- So, you the Swamp Thing?
- That's right.

37:53.390 --> 37:56.650
- Flyin' the plane?
- That's right.

37:56.690 --> 38:00.860
- it's amazing the shit
you white trash know.
- That's right.

38:03.570 --> 38:06.700
Shit! Aw, man!

38:35.100 --> 38:37.060
What're you doin' here?

38:39.020 --> 38:42.360
Hello.
How you doin', baby?

38:42.440 --> 38:45.570
I'm just, uh, tryin' to get out of
the storm, you know. Grab my lunch.

38:45.610 --> 38:48.780
- Well, this is a restricted area.
- Look, don't worry, baby.

38:48.910 --> 38:52.580
- it's all right. I'm a-- I'm a cop.
- You work for a prison or somethin'?

38:52.700 --> 38:56.920
Yeah, the Department of Erect--
Corrections. Caught me slippin'.

38:57.960 --> 38:59.920
Creepy.

38:59.960 --> 39:02.800
The eyes are cut
out of their heads.

39:07.470 --> 39:09.300
The Last Supper.

39:11.640 --> 39:13.600
- is that it?
- One more.

39:14.640 --> 39:16.440
Late addition.

39:16.480 --> 39:18.650
- Who?
- Garland Greene.

39:19.650 --> 39:21.440
Should be interesting.

39:42.790 --> 39:46.670
- What the fuck is that?
- That's Garland Greene, man.

39:54.520 --> 39:56.520
Christ in a cartoon!

39:56.640 --> 39:58.600
Shit, that's
Garland Greene, man.

39:58.690 --> 40:00.520
The Marietta Mangler.

40:00.650 --> 40:02.820
That skinny little man
butchered 30 somethin' people...

40:02.940 --> 40:05.190
up and down
the eastern seaboard.

40:05.320 --> 40:07.190
They say the way
he killed those people...

40:07.320 --> 40:10.360
makes the Manson family
look like the Partridge family.

40:11.700 --> 40:15.290
Well, he's on
the right flight.

40:15.370 --> 40:17.500
- But you know what,
you really do need to leave.
- Tina, you've got...

40:17.540 --> 40:20.830
the prettiest eyes I've seen
in about five to ten.

40:30.050 --> 40:32.800
"Met ca-- Me--
Me. Et cetera.

40:32.850 --> 40:35.810
Cetera. Meet.""

40:35.890 --> 40:39.850
Me, et cetera, me arson.
Meet car. Meet cars. Meet cars.

40:39.980 --> 40:42.980
Meet cars. Meet cars.
Meet cars. Where?

40:45.400 --> 40:48.320
"Carson...

40:49.530 --> 40:51.990
City.""

40:52.070 --> 40:56.910
Oh, God. Uh, stay here.
Don't touch anything.

41:02.920 --> 41:06.340
Hey, what're you doin'?
Just leave it alone. He told
you not to touch anything.

41:28.610 --> 41:31.570
What the hell?

41:34.620 --> 41:38.700
You wanna have some more fun,
keep it up.

41:59.310 --> 42:00.970
Come on.

42:10.400 --> 42:14.660
We've got a situation here, sir.
Somebody better call
the marshal's office.

42:18.120 --> 42:20.580
Code red! Code red!
Starkey, those guards ain't guards.

42:20.660 --> 42:23.500
- They're cons. Stall 'em.
- Christ!

42:36.180 --> 42:38.970
- Hey, how are ya?
- Almost ready?

42:39.010 --> 42:42.600
Won't be long now.

42:52.530 --> 42:56.200
- You're the man, Cyrus!
- Let's go!

43:03.540 --> 43:06.370
Do you hear somethin'
that sounds like a damn plane?

43:12.000 --> 43:14.340
Jailbird One, you are
not cleared for takeoff.

43:14.380 --> 43:17.840
Hey, nobody on this aircraft
gives a flyin' fuck!

43:17.890 --> 43:21.470
Get it? "Flyin' fuck!'
Thank you. I'm here all week.

43:25.390 --> 43:28.310
Hey! Hey, Cochise,
it's me!

43:28.350 --> 43:32.020
Pinball. I'm sorry.
Hey!

43:40.910 --> 43:43.040
Shine, sweet freedom,
shine!

43:52.090 --> 43:54.920
Trust me, folks. This is gonna be
a day you will never forget.

43:55.050 --> 43:58.880
Just step right on board
and find yourself a seat.

44:02.430 --> 44:04.720
Don't they have a way
of tracking these planes?

44:04.770 --> 44:08.560
Oh, yeah. it's called a transponder.
Every plane's got one, Cindino.

44:08.600 --> 44:12.020
Swamp, where is
the transponder?

44:15.610 --> 44:17.860
Where indeed?

44:21.110 --> 44:23.780
Are, are you sure it's safe
to fly in this?

44:23.910 --> 44:27.870
No problem. I've done this
a thousand times. We'll be
through this in a few minutes.

44:27.960 --> 44:30.040
You all right back there,
ladies?

44:32.710 --> 44:35.300
We're following the transponder.
We know exactly where they're heading.

44:36.630 --> 44:38.760
What the fuck happened?

44:38.880 --> 44:41.050
What about Sims?
What happened to Sims?

44:41.130 --> 44:43.600
Duncan,
they killed him.

44:43.640 --> 44:45.640
They got the plane.

44:57.650 --> 45:01.240
Tell me, Skip, what kind
of a Keystone Cops operation
are you guys runnin' here, huh?

45:01.280 --> 45:04.070
And you! You, you little shit.
You got my agent killed!

45:04.160 --> 45:06.120
Hey, he brought a gun
on the plane.

45:06.160 --> 45:09.120
if I knew the way you guys
run things, I would've told him
bring a fuckin' uzi on board!

45:09.160 --> 45:12.750
No one carries on these flights!
No one!

45:12.830 --> 45:14.590
He brought a gun on board
and he got himself killed.

45:14.630 --> 45:16.460
And in doing so, he compromised
the safety of my men!

45:16.590 --> 45:18.960
Your men are incompetent!

45:19.010 --> 45:22.300
They let themselves get taken over by
a bunch of thugs in chains and cages!

45:22.340 --> 45:24.300
- I'm not gonna stand around...
- Guys!
- and listen to this shit!

45:24.340 --> 45:27.640
Guys, guys.
Let's work it out.

45:28.520 --> 45:31.100
Okay. Okay.

45:33.150 --> 45:36.520
So, uh,
what do we do now?

45:36.650 --> 45:38.690
What's the plan? You, uh,
you-you-you do have a plan, don't you?

45:38.820 --> 45:40.690
We're workin' on it.

45:40.820 --> 45:43.450
Contingency plans for something
like this don't exist.

45:43.530 --> 45:46.490
-The situation's
never been contemplated.
-Well, you better start contemplating...

45:46.620 --> 45:51.830
'cause this is a situation that
needs to get unfucked right now!

45:51.960 --> 45:55.540
I want a chopper. Make that a few
of 'em. They need to be armed.

45:55.670 --> 45:58.960
I don't care if it's National
Guard, Air Force, whatever.

45:59.000 --> 46:01.010
Just get 'em here,
and get 'em here now.

46:04.840 --> 46:07.180
- What do you want to do with him?
- I don't know.

46:07.220 --> 46:11.180
But this is no way to treat
a national treasure. Let him out.

46:12.480 --> 46:15.850
- You sure?
- Love your work.

46:46.050 --> 46:49.510
They're headed southeast
toward Arizona.

46:57.600 --> 47:01.570
- Pinball didn't make it.
- No?

47:01.690 --> 47:05.360
That's too bad.
I liked Pinball.

47:05.450 --> 47:08.700
- What do you want?
- I wanna know what the plan is.

47:08.740 --> 47:11.240
Why you care?

47:11.290 --> 47:15.120
I got just as much ridin' on this
as you. We're all convicts here.

47:15.250 --> 47:17.210
Cyrus Grissom,
do you copy?

47:17.290 --> 47:19.380
Cyrus Grissom,
do you copy?

47:19.420 --> 47:22.550
Yes, I copy.
ldentify yourself.

47:22.590 --> 47:26.430
This is United States Marshal Vince
Larkin and Duncan Malloy of the DEA.

47:26.470 --> 47:30.050
Oh, Agent Malloy. I'm so sorry
about your associate.

47:30.140 --> 47:33.640
Nothing is quite as sad as seeing
a grown man pissing his pants.

47:33.720 --> 47:35.930
Listen, Grissom,
you puny, fucking animal!

47:36.060 --> 47:38.730
When I get through with you, you'll be
beggin' 'em for the electric chair.

47:38.770 --> 47:40.900
Hey, I don't like him.

47:40.940 --> 47:43.940
if he speaks again, this
conversation is terminated.

47:44.070 --> 47:48.610
He doesn't want to talk again.
Really. He's done talking.
He's leaving the building, okay?

47:48.740 --> 47:51.200
Good, then I'll talk to you.
Here are the rules.

47:51.280 --> 47:54.080
First I ask a question,
then you ask a question.

47:54.120 --> 47:55.790
Okay.
What's your question?

47:55.910 --> 47:59.080
ln Carson City, your bulls
were onto us. How?

47:59.120 --> 48:02.420
- One of the guards--
- One of the guards--

48:02.460 --> 48:06.420
One of the guards faked a heart attack
and we had to remove his restraints.

48:06.550 --> 48:08.590
All right?

48:08.630 --> 48:10.590
I see.
And what's your question?

48:10.640 --> 48:12.930
Where you goin'
with my plane, Cyrus?

48:12.970 --> 48:15.970
- We're going to Disneyland.
- You're lying, Cyrus.

48:16.100 --> 48:20.270
So are you, Vince.
Oh, nothin'

48:20.310 --> 48:24.780
Makes me sadder than the agent
lost his bladder in the

48:24.820 --> 48:27.150
Airplane

48:29.610 --> 48:33.280
Lerner Airfield, Poe. Middle of nowhere.
That's our rendezvous point.

48:33.330 --> 48:36.750
Forty-nine minutes from anything
resembling authority.

48:36.830 --> 48:39.290
So, now you know.

48:39.330 --> 48:42.080
Your attention, please.
Flight 475--

48:42.170 --> 48:45.800
You excited? Yeah?
Sure look pretty.

48:51.840 --> 48:54.470
- Mrs. Poe?
- That's right.

48:54.510 --> 48:57.140
My name's Grant,
U.S. Marshal Service.

48:57.270 --> 49:01.150
There's been a slight problem
on your husband's flight.
Your presence is requested.

49:01.190 --> 49:03.860
I have a jet
standing by.

49:10.030 --> 49:13.870
Yee-ha!
What's on your mind, hillbilly?

49:13.950 --> 49:17.370
What was I thinking about?

49:17.450 --> 49:20.000
Oh, yeah. Yee-ha.
That's right.

49:20.040 --> 49:24.000
I was just wonderin' what a black
militant, uh, that would be you...

49:24.130 --> 49:27.550
was doin' takin' orders from
a white boy on a power trip.

49:27.670 --> 49:31.630
-Don't you think that's strange?
-it's a means to an end,
my white friend.

49:31.840 --> 49:34.180
A means to an end.
See...

49:34.220 --> 49:37.680
I's can play house nigger till's
we get to where we're goin'.

49:37.720 --> 49:42.190
And then,
the day of the dog begins.

49:51.200 --> 49:53.530
So what was that
all about?

49:53.570 --> 49:56.370
Oh, nothin',
except they somehow managed...

49:56.410 --> 50:00.700
to get every creep and freak
in the universe onto this one plane...

50:00.750 --> 50:04.830
and then somehow managed
to let them take it over...

50:04.920 --> 50:09.050
and then somehow managed to stick us
right smack in the middle.

50:16.090 --> 50:17.720
Hi, Garland.

50:20.680 --> 50:24.600
Here's the jacket on Cameron Poe.
His wife's on the way here now.

50:24.650 --> 50:26.610
U.S. Ranger,
highly decorated.

50:26.690 --> 50:28.520
Did a little hell-raising when
he was a kid, but nothing serious.

50:28.610 --> 50:30.900
Explain to me
why any of this matters.

50:30.940 --> 50:33.450
Fact one. We got a plane up there filled
with killers, rapists and thieves...

50:33.570 --> 50:36.570
and we got this guy Cameron Poe,
in on an involuntary manslaughter beef.

50:36.620 --> 50:39.620
Non-gang affiliated. He's
a parolee hitchin' a ride home.

50:39.700 --> 50:43.250
Fact two. Poe has a chance
to get off the plane.

50:43.370 --> 50:45.870
Doesn't do it. Why?

50:45.960 --> 50:49.590
Fact three. Our guard, Falzon,
said a convict named Cameron Poe...

50:49.710 --> 50:51.960
planted Sims's
tape recorder on him.

50:52.130 --> 50:56.680
These are interesting facts.
You do the math on this, and
we got an ally on that plane.

50:56.760 --> 51:00.350
Ally? This guy is a criminal.
A murderer.

51:00.390 --> 51:05.140
Read the file. Got in a drunken brawl
defending his wife and he killed a guy.

51:05.190 --> 51:06.440
Could have happened to any one
of us, including you and me.

51:06.480 --> 51:08.190
I am not one
of these animals.

51:08.270 --> 51:10.940
Oh, that's original! When exactly
did they all become animals?

51:11.020 --> 51:14.240
When they stopped giving a damn
about the law, about civilization.

51:14.320 --> 51:18.240
"The degree of civilization
in a society can be judged
by observing its prisoners.'

51:18.320 --> 51:21.240
Dostoevsky said that
after doing a little time.

51:21.330 --> 51:26.080
"Fuck you!' Cyrus Grissom
said that after putting a bullet
in my agent's head. Okay?

51:26.170 --> 51:28.580
The issue here is how the plane
is brought down.

51:28.670 --> 51:30.630
Shoot it down.

51:30.710 --> 51:34.720
Yeah. When exactly did this
become a DEA jurisdiction?

51:34.800 --> 51:37.430
The second the DEA agent
was murdered.

51:37.510 --> 51:40.260
I am authorized to bring Agent Sims's
killers to justice using...

51:40.350 --> 51:43.310
and I quote,
"All necessary means.'

51:43.390 --> 51:46.310
- That does not include
shooting down my plane.
- Maybe it does, maybe it doesn't.

51:46.390 --> 51:49.150
is that right? Tell me you're
not seriously entertaining this.

51:49.230 --> 51:51.940
Vince, this is
a drastic situation we got.

51:52.020 --> 51:55.490
-Those are our men up there!
-All of whom signed a no-hostage
clause. They know the score.

51:55.610 --> 51:59.030
Who are you to decide the value
of a man's life? There are
innocent people up there!

51:59.110 --> 52:02.620
About time.

52:02.700 --> 52:06.290
-For what? About time for what?
-Attack choppers. We're going after 'em.

52:11.920 --> 52:15.130
Goddamn it!
Skip, don't do this!

52:15.210 --> 52:18.180
This man is in an irrational state
of mind! His head isn't on straight.

52:18.300 --> 52:22.140
Fuck off, Marshal Larkin.
Your job's finished. This flight's full.

52:31.400 --> 52:36.150
Gentlemen, in roughly
five hours, we will be flying
over the shores of Mexico.

52:36.280 --> 52:39.150
But first we have
to change aircraft.

52:39.280 --> 52:41.660
Thank you, and have
a pleasant flight.

52:41.700 --> 52:46.830
- What's the ETA, Swamp Thing?
- At 228 miles an hour,
about 71 minutes.

52:46.870 --> 52:50.540
The only problem is, we're not doing
228 miles an hour. We're doing 205.

52:50.670 --> 52:54.340
We're draggin', baby.
The landing gear ain't all
the way up. We're gonna be late.

52:54.380 --> 52:57.840
- No, no, no. Cyrus,
that's unacceptable.
- Check out the gear.

52:57.880 --> 53:00.680
- What the hell do I know
about landing gear?
- Learn.

53:03.890 --> 53:05.890
Hillbilly!

53:05.970 --> 53:07.850
Poe.

53:12.480 --> 53:16.360
- Yeah?
- Cyrus wants you to check out
the landing gear.

53:16.480 --> 53:19.530
Then I'll get to see some nice
scenery whippin' by down there.

53:24.990 --> 53:26.870
Trees and stuff.

53:47.100 --> 53:50.230
Goddamn! So that's
what happened to Pinball.

53:50.270 --> 53:53.560
Cut him loose. He's slowin'
us down. Dead weight.

53:53.600 --> 53:56.230
Not exactly
a proper burial.

53:56.360 --> 53:58.780
Look at our shit
over there.

54:18.920 --> 54:20.300
Hurry up.

54:22.880 --> 54:24.930
Hillbilly.

54:25.050 --> 54:26.640
Gotcha.

54:27.930 --> 54:30.430
Hurry up, man.

54:36.230 --> 54:38.150
Bye, Pinball.

54:52.290 --> 54:55.290
Oh, boy! You see that?
You see?

54:55.420 --> 55:00.460
Every time we get her waxed,
I get ten feet from the car wash
and then, pow, bird shit.

55:00.590 --> 55:03.970
Well, it's supposed to be
good luck.

55:06.090 --> 55:08.600
- Light's changed.
- Oh, damn.

55:31.740 --> 55:34.000
- You were in the "Q,' right?
- Yeah.

55:34.080 --> 55:37.540
And I heard you say
you had 15 years.

55:38.830 --> 55:40.500
That's right.

55:40.540 --> 55:44.670
But then that would put you
on north block. Right?

55:44.760 --> 55:47.720
Yeah.

55:47.840 --> 55:50.390
Yeah. Funny thing.

55:50.510 --> 55:55.350
I was on north block.
I don't know you.

55:55.430 --> 55:58.850
Well, you know what,
uh, pal?

55:58.900 --> 56:03.530
What do you think that means?
Nothin'. Not diddly shit.

56:03.610 --> 56:06.030
You see, there were 160 cats
on north block...

56:06.070 --> 56:10.530
and I didn't want to know 159
of them, which included you.

56:10.570 --> 56:13.080
What do you think
about that?

56:13.120 --> 56:15.080
Yeah.

56:23.090 --> 56:25.760
He's a font
of misplaced rage.

56:25.880 --> 56:30.260
Name your cliche. Mother held
him too much, or not enough.

56:30.390 --> 56:33.100
Last picked at kick ball,
late-night sneaky uncle. Whatever.

56:34.970 --> 56:38.770
Now he's so angry, moments of
levity actually cause him pain.

56:39.940 --> 56:41.560
Gives him headaches.

56:41.610 --> 56:44.270
Happiness, for
that gentleman, hurts.

56:45.400 --> 56:47.440
What's wrong with him?

56:47.570 --> 56:50.740
My first thought would be
a lot.

56:53.490 --> 56:55.160
- Hello.
- Hello.

56:55.290 --> 56:57.500
- Hi. I'm, I'm Vince Larkin.
- I'm Tricia Poe.

56:57.620 --> 57:01.170
Nice to meet ya.
This, this must be Casey.

57:01.290 --> 57:04.090
- Hello, Casey.
- Hello, Vince Larkin.
- Nice to meet ya.

57:05.170 --> 57:07.130
So how are you doin'?

57:07.260 --> 57:09.590
I'm sorry. That's, uh-- Scratch
that. Dumb question. You--

57:09.680 --> 57:13.140
You wanted to see your husband today,
and then this whole thing happened.

57:13.260 --> 57:16.600
Maybe you could just tell me
exactly what's going on here and--

57:16.640 --> 57:19.640
We're doing everything we can
to get the plane down.

57:19.690 --> 57:22.770
Actually, that's w-why I wanted
to talk to you.

57:27.030 --> 57:29.490
Hey, wait. W-Where'd you get
the rims, man?

57:29.610 --> 57:32.610
My personal shit's
down in the belly.

57:34.450 --> 57:37.040
- Hey, those are my shades.
- They're mine now, sister.

57:37.160 --> 57:39.120
Men!

57:45.290 --> 57:49.130
it seems that your husband,
Cameron...

57:49.210 --> 57:51.630
had an opportunity to get off
the plane and he didn't do it.

57:51.680 --> 57:54.300
And I was hoping
you could...

57:54.390 --> 57:57.970
maybe help me
figure out why.

57:58.060 --> 58:01.480
That would make two of us.
I don't know.

58:01.520 --> 58:03.560
I mean, it's possible,
it's, it's not uncommon...

58:03.690 --> 58:07.570
that some parolees actually fear
their release date.

58:07.690 --> 58:11.320
A certain degree of institutionalization
sets in. Fear of coming home.

58:11.400 --> 58:13.910
- Fear of living in society.
Any of this make sense?
- No, no.

58:14.030 --> 58:17.830
That's not Cameron. I mean, if you, if
you knew him, if you read his letters...

58:17.870 --> 58:20.660
or if you talked to him
on the phone, you'd know that--

58:20.750 --> 58:25.000
I mean, he's been waitin' for this day
for eight years. He's not gonna--

58:27.420 --> 58:32.010
I mean, look, he's got this little,
this little girl to come home to.

58:33.880 --> 58:36.180
Wouldn't you...

58:36.260 --> 58:38.350
do the same thing?

58:41.230 --> 58:44.350
There'd have to be a pretty strong
reason to keep me on that plane.

58:44.440 --> 58:47.520
Well, knowing Cameron,
I'm sure there is a good reason.

58:49.690 --> 58:54.450
Uh, maybe, if you, if you do
see him or if you talk to him...

58:54.570 --> 58:58.740
maybe you could just tell him
to come home, all right?

58:58.870 --> 59:01.290
Be kinda nice
to have him around.

59:02.250 --> 59:04.250
You got it.

59:05.290 --> 59:07.460
Vince, line one.

59:09.800 --> 59:11.880
This body fell out
of the sky.

59:11.920 --> 59:16.220
Vince Larkin? This is Ted Grasso,
Fresno Police Department.

59:16.300 --> 59:18.640
We got a problem here
with a corpse.

59:20.100 --> 59:21.770
Yeah, it fell out
of the sky.

59:21.890 --> 59:23.810
I don't think
he's an astronaut.

59:23.930 --> 59:26.940
Then what's this got
to do with me?

59:27.060 --> 59:29.730
it's got your name
written all over it.

59:35.070 --> 59:37.910
Last transponder tag
was in Arizona.

59:37.950 --> 59:40.330
Body falls here,
in Fresno.

59:40.450 --> 59:43.250
Lerner Airfield.
They're turning around.

59:43.290 --> 59:44.910
- They're coming back.
Can you get me Chief--
- Devers.

59:45.000 --> 59:46.960
Please. Thank you.

59:47.080 --> 59:49.330
- Vince?
- Turn around.

59:49.460 --> 59:52.250
Plane's headed to Lerner Airfield. it's
a small strip about 100 miles from here.

59:52.340 --> 59:56.130
Horseshit! We're tailing the
transponder tag into Arizona.

59:56.260 --> 59:58.590
Listen to me.
A body fell from the sky.

59:58.640 --> 01:00:01.100
it had a note on it.

01:00:01.140 --> 01:00:04.140
We got 'em vectored
at 12:00 and 30 miles.

01:00:04.270 --> 01:00:08.270
- Vince, please, son.
We're right on his tail.
- Just listen to me!

01:00:08.350 --> 01:00:10.770
it was to me!
The note on the body was to me!

01:00:10.810 --> 01:00:13.030
- You're chasing the wrong--
- Aw, shut up.

01:00:13.150 --> 01:00:14.440
Hello?

01:00:16.150 --> 01:00:18.780
Guys, guys! I need a plane
or a chopper now!

01:00:18.820 --> 01:00:21.330
Hey, you and me both.
I'm all out.

01:00:21.370 --> 01:00:24.120
I've got to get to Lerner Airfield
and I've got about 50 minutes.

01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:26.330
Got a fast car,
you can drive it.

01:00:30.290 --> 01:00:32.710
Larkin. Vince Larkin.
I'm with the Marshal Services.

01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:35.460
Send whatever you got. Sheriff,
state trooper, national guard.

01:00:35.510 --> 01:00:37.970
Hold on one minute.

01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:43.220
Your men should proceed
with extreme caution.

01:00:43.350 --> 01:00:45.810
it's only a matter of time
before they find the weapons hold.

01:00:50.230 --> 01:00:52.900
Larkin. Vince Larkin.
Marshal Services.

01:00:53.020 --> 01:00:54.900
How do you think
I got the number?

01:01:00.740 --> 01:01:04.200
'...appears to the United States
Parole Commission that--'

01:01:05.790 --> 01:01:07.910
Poe.

01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:11.380
Man! Oh, yeah!

01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:15.550
Put the bunny
back in the box.

01:01:17.590 --> 01:01:21.180
I knew you was a punk.
And I was right.

01:01:21.260 --> 01:01:24.430
You been playin' us
all along.

01:01:24.510 --> 01:01:27.060
You a free man.

01:01:27.140 --> 01:01:31.020
I said, put the bunny...

01:01:31.100 --> 01:01:33.610
back in the box.

01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:06.970
Die, punk!

01:02:15.110 --> 01:02:19.070
Why couldn't you put the bunny
back in the box?

01:02:21.490 --> 01:02:25.160
Next, folks, below and to your left,
you'll see the vertical Renoir Cliffs.

01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:31.120
We're seconds away from
establishing visual contact.

01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:35.830
Holy shit!

01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:39.090
Abort! Abort! Abort!

01:02:39.170 --> 01:02:44.010
if that aircraft's carrying
30 prisoners, I'm Elvis Presley.

01:02:45.050 --> 01:02:47.930
"Uncle Bob's Scenic Tours.'

01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:52.890
Shit!

01:02:52.980 --> 01:02:56.900
Three hundred fuckin' miles
to apprehend Ma and Pa fucking Kettle!

01:02:56.980 --> 01:02:59.820
We need to get
to Lerner Airfield now!

01:02:59.900 --> 01:03:02.110
Get me Vince Larkin.

01:03:12.410 --> 01:03:14.830
Two went down,
one came up.

01:03:14.920 --> 01:03:18.170
- Wasn't my fault.
- Well, you don't have to tell me.

01:03:18.250 --> 01:03:21.000
Most murders are crimes
of necessity rather than desire.

01:03:21.090 --> 01:03:25.340
But the great ones,
Dahmer, Gacy, Bundy...

01:03:25.430 --> 01:03:27.760
- they did it because it excited them.
- Don't you--

01:03:29.720 --> 01:03:31.850
I got nothing in common
with them, with you.

01:03:31.930 --> 01:03:35.390
Don't you talk to me!
They were insane.

01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:39.020
Now you're talking
semantics.

01:03:39.110 --> 01:03:43.030
What if I told you insane
was working 50 hours a week
in some office for 50 years...

01:03:43.110 --> 01:03:45.860
at the end of which
they tell you to piss off?

01:03:45.950 --> 01:03:48.370
Ending up
in some retirement village...

01:03:48.450 --> 01:03:52.870
hoping to die before suffering
the indignity of trying to make
it to the toilet on time.

01:03:54.540 --> 01:03:56.790
Wouldn't you consider that
to be insane?

01:03:56.870 --> 01:04:02.550
Murdering 30 people,
semantics or not, is insane!

01:04:04.210 --> 01:04:06.050
One girl...

01:04:06.130 --> 01:04:08.220
I drove through three states
wearing her head as a hat.

01:04:08.300 --> 01:04:11.260
it's my daughter's birthday
today.

01:04:11.350 --> 01:04:14.430
So please feel free
not to share everything with me.

01:05:15.490 --> 01:05:19.500
All right, you damn peckerwoods,
crack the knuckles and hit the crystals.

01:05:19.580 --> 01:05:21.920
We're putting this baby
down in a sandbox.

01:05:30.930 --> 01:05:33.850
Lerner Tower,
do you copy?

01:05:33.930 --> 01:05:37.020
Lerner Tower,
are you there, Phil?

01:05:41.900 --> 01:05:43.480
Come on, answer me.

01:05:43.560 --> 01:05:46.150
I am landing.

01:06:14.430 --> 01:06:16.470
Oh, my God.

01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:18.720
Look out!

01:07:33.130 --> 01:07:35.970
Lerner Airfield.
I'm so glad to be here.

01:07:39.180 --> 01:07:41.930
Thank you
for choosing Con Air.

01:07:43.810 --> 01:07:47.980
- Where's the plane, Francisco?
- I don't know. Have patience.

01:07:48.060 --> 01:07:51.900
The last guy who told me to have
patience? I burned him down,
and bagged his ashes.

01:07:51.980 --> 01:07:53.990
Cyrus, it'll be here.

01:08:01.370 --> 01:08:05.080
Hey, you stupid sons of bitches!
Jesus Christ!

01:08:11.090 --> 01:08:13.630
I hope he likes sand.

01:08:13.710 --> 01:08:17.010
-Muchacho, run and check out the
tower. Have a look-see, yeah?
-All right.

01:08:17.090 --> 01:08:18.930
You come with us.

01:08:23.350 --> 01:08:25.979
- Let's go. We're gettin' off.
- Boss, I can't.
- Yes, you can. Come on!

01:08:26.060 --> 01:08:28.689
- You shouldn't move him.
- I'm getting him off of this plane.

01:08:28.770 --> 01:08:32.770
You, you can't move him. He's
too far along. He could go into shock.

01:08:32.859 --> 01:08:35.149
She's right, Poe.
Go on, man.

01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:37.609
I'm not leaving
without you, or you.

01:08:37.700 --> 01:08:40.660
Ah, listen. Here we go.
Ranger boy.

01:08:40.740 --> 01:08:44.040
- Right.
- Goddamn it, Poe!

01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:46.710
Man, it's time to fight,
fuck or hit the fence.

01:08:46.790 --> 01:08:49.250
- I suggest you hit the fence.
- He's right.

01:08:49.330 --> 01:08:51.710
Just go.

01:08:51.790 --> 01:08:55.170
All right. Here's how it's gonna play.
I'm gonna get you that needle.

01:08:55.260 --> 01:08:57.970
Whatever you say, man.
Just do what you gotta do.

01:08:58.050 --> 01:08:59.640
Fuck.

01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:02.510
All right, you just hang on.
Don't die on me.

01:09:03.060 --> 01:09:08.060
Swing low, sweet chariot

01:09:08.140 --> 01:09:11.149
Comin' for
to carry me home

01:09:11.229 --> 01:09:14.979
Oh, no. What the hell
you think you're doin'?

01:09:15.029 --> 01:09:17.819
- it's time to off the pigs.
- You can't do that.

01:09:17.859 --> 01:09:20.859
- Tell me why.
- They're hostages. We need 'em.

01:09:20.990 --> 01:09:25.740
- But why the fuck you care?
- Hey, man, come on.

01:09:25.830 --> 01:09:29.830
I can't think of a thing
I'd like better...

01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:34.340
than to put a bullet in the brain base
of every one of these fuckers!

01:09:34.420 --> 01:09:38.380
But the fact of the matter is,
how well you know this Cindino?

01:09:38.510 --> 01:09:41.590
I mean, I don't know him that
well myself. Just what I read.

01:09:41.720 --> 01:09:45.140
Like how he firebombed
that senator's yacht with two
of his own cousins on board.

01:09:45.180 --> 01:09:47.310
So what's your point?

01:09:47.390 --> 01:09:49.939
Why would he sweat
about killing some hired guns
once they'd served his purpose?

01:09:50.020 --> 01:09:53.859
- Now think about that.
- What exactly are we discussing here?

01:09:53.939 --> 01:09:56.360
Poe don't want me
to off the pigs.

01:09:56.440 --> 01:10:00.200
Well, it's not difficult to surmise how
Nathan here feels about killing guards.

01:10:00.280 --> 01:10:02.870
And my own proclivities
are, uh...

01:10:02.950 --> 01:10:08.370
well-known and, uh,
often-lamented facts of penal lore.

01:10:08.410 --> 01:10:11.290
What I'm wonderin' is why you have
any opinion about it at all.

01:10:11.370 --> 01:10:14.210
Cyrus, this is your barbecue,
man, and it tastes good.

01:10:14.250 --> 01:10:18.630
But I was just sayin' to Mr. Dog over
here, that if it was my barbecue...

01:10:18.710 --> 01:10:22.550
I'd wait for that old jumbo jet
in the sky before I start
killin' our only leverage.

01:10:22.590 --> 01:10:25.390
- Shut the fuck up!
- Don't you want to get high
and get laid?

01:10:25.430 --> 01:10:26.890
- Shit.
- Oh, fuck this!

01:10:26.970 --> 01:10:31.520
Put the gun down.
Put the gun down, Nathan.

01:10:31.600 --> 01:10:34.190
Poe's right.
We're goin' to Plan "B.'

01:10:34.270 --> 01:10:37.110
Gonna get a refuelling truck
and a tractor.

01:10:37.230 --> 01:10:39.610
So get back there
and dig the plane out.

01:10:56.920 --> 01:11:01.420
No. Yes!

01:11:17.190 --> 01:11:21.820
- Viking, 'bout time to go
and get that tractor, yeah?
- Right.

01:11:23.530 --> 01:11:26.280
- I'll get the fuel truck.
- Thanks, Poe.

01:11:26.370 --> 01:11:29.120
You've proven to be
a most useful mammal.

01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:32.830
"Many hands make light work.'
My daddy taught me that.

01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:35.460
- You know what my daddy taught me?
- What's that?

01:11:35.540 --> 01:11:39.590
- Nothin'.
- Self-educated man.

01:11:42.130 --> 01:11:45.510
-Have you found Vince Larkin?
-We're having trouble reaching him, sir.

01:11:45.630 --> 01:11:48.350
Of course, you're having trouble
reaching him!

01:11:48.470 --> 01:11:53.060
He's off saving the rain forest
or recycling his sandals or some shit.

01:12:27.090 --> 01:12:29.510
Holy shit!

01:12:35.930 --> 01:12:39.350
Hey! We've got company!

01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:41.480
Hey!

01:12:41.570 --> 01:12:44.110
We've got company!

01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:48.280
Go get Cyrus.

01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:50.030
Yo, Cyrus!

01:12:57.040 --> 01:12:59.080
How long we got
till they get here, Nathan?

01:12:59.210 --> 01:13:03.050
Ten, twelve minutes, tops.

01:13:11.390 --> 01:13:14.850
Hey, what's your name?
Wanna play?

01:13:26.490 --> 01:13:28.400
Nice jet.

01:13:28.490 --> 01:13:31.740
You can take Cindino and leave
the rest to rot for all I care.

01:13:31.780 --> 01:13:35.790
You fire that weapon, 20 pissed-off
prisoners are gonna hear it.

01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:44.670
Well, hooray for the sounds
of fuckin' silence.

01:13:44.750 --> 01:13:46.590
Freeze!

01:14:05.940 --> 01:14:08.070
- You're Cameron Poe.
- That's right.

01:14:08.150 --> 01:14:10.950
- I'm Larkin.
- Hello, Larkin.

01:14:10.990 --> 01:14:13.280
- I got your message.
- Where are the troops?

01:14:13.370 --> 01:14:16.120
- They'll be here.
- "They'll be here"?

01:14:16.200 --> 01:14:18.950
Uh-huh. ln a minute.

01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:22.790
Listen, Poe,
can I lower this?

01:14:22.830 --> 01:14:25.920
- Go ahead.
- You gonna lower yours?

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:29.130
Sorry, boss, but there's only
two men I trust.

01:14:29.210 --> 01:14:31.630
One of them's me.
The other's not you.

01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:37.470
- So Cindino was running
a drag on everyone.
- Yeah.

01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:40.230
if you can't trust a South American
drug lord, who can you trust, huh?

01:14:42.900 --> 01:14:46.900
- That was a joke.
- I'm glad you told me. Now
I gotta get back to the plane.

01:14:48.570 --> 01:14:51.530
You're a free man, Poe.
What are you doin'?

01:14:51.650 --> 01:14:54.990
I can't trade a friend's life
for my own, Larkin. That's all.

01:14:55.070 --> 01:14:57.830
You got a friend on board?

01:14:57.870 --> 01:15:01.830
See, I knew I was right
about you. I read your file.

01:15:01.870 --> 01:15:05.420
You're not such a bad guy. Just always
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

01:15:05.500 --> 01:15:07.670
Good-bye, Larkin.

01:15:09.670 --> 01:15:12.050
I spoke to your wife.

01:15:18.260 --> 01:15:20.810
- ln person?
- ln person.

01:15:21.850 --> 01:15:23.770
And your little girl.

01:15:25.900 --> 01:15:28.860
You saw Casey?

01:15:33.450 --> 01:15:36.370
if this thing goes bad, Larkin,
I'm afraid my daughter...

01:15:36.410 --> 01:15:39.700
won't understand.

01:15:39.740 --> 01:15:44.040
if you talk to my wife again,
you tell her...

01:15:44.120 --> 01:15:46.040
I love her.

01:15:47.130 --> 01:15:50.050
She's my hummingbird.

01:15:50.130 --> 01:15:54.800
But I couldn't leave
a fallen man behind.

01:15:57.300 --> 01:16:00.390
You'll do that for me,
won't you, Larkin?

01:16:00.470 --> 01:16:04.640
Sure I will.
What are you gonna do for me?

01:16:04.730 --> 01:16:07.150
What do you think
I'm gonna do?

01:16:07.230 --> 01:16:09.230
I'm gonna save
the fuckin' day.

01:16:23.580 --> 01:16:27.290
Let's go, gentlemen.
The cavalry is on its way.

01:16:27.420 --> 01:16:32.340
- I want this airplane out now.
- Come on, men!

01:16:47.100 --> 01:16:50.940
- About another ten minutes.
- You said ten minutes ten minutes ago.

01:16:54.320 --> 01:16:56.610
Hello, Bob.
Wanna come over for dinner?

01:17:01.490 --> 01:17:04.500
Are you sick?

01:17:04.620 --> 01:17:08.080
- Why do you ask?
- You look sick.

01:17:09.880 --> 01:17:13.340
- I am sick.
- You take medicine?

01:17:13.460 --> 01:17:15.590
There is no medicine
for what I have.

01:17:17.130 --> 01:17:19.930
- Wanna sing?
- Sing?

01:17:20.010 --> 01:17:22.640
Do you know "He's Got
the Whole World in His Hands"?

01:17:23.760 --> 01:17:25.350
Yes, I do.

01:17:25.430 --> 01:17:29.390
He's got the whole world
in His hands

01:17:29.480 --> 01:17:31.520
He's got
the whole wide world

01:17:31.650 --> 01:17:33.610
Come on.

01:17:33.690 --> 01:17:38.990
He's got the whole world
in His hands

01:17:39.070 --> 01:17:43.370
He's got the whole wide world
in His hands

01:17:43.450 --> 01:17:47.960
He's got the whole world
in His hands

01:17:48.040 --> 01:17:51.960
He's got the whole world
in His hands

01:18:09.770 --> 01:18:12.690
it's on the ground. Repeat.
The plane is on the ground.

01:18:12.770 --> 01:18:14.730
But it won't be for long.
Where the hell are ya?

01:18:14.820 --> 01:18:16.900
We're westbound
near the Lerner cutoff.

01:18:48.100 --> 01:18:50.060
Where's Cindino?

01:18:53.270 --> 01:18:55.650
That's my fuckin' plane!

01:19:41.690 --> 01:19:43.610
Cyrus, help me.

01:19:47.450 --> 01:19:51.120
- Looks like you missed your connection.
- We were-- We were coming to get you.

01:19:54.160 --> 01:19:56.120
Please.

01:19:56.210 --> 01:19:57.920
- Cy--
- --Onara.

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.420
No!

01:20:38.330 --> 01:20:42.630
- Don't kill me.
- I'm not gonna kill you, old-timer.

01:20:42.750 --> 01:20:45.170
Listen, I need a syringe.

01:20:45.260 --> 01:20:48.590
Oh, no!
Drugs'll end you, son.

01:20:48.680 --> 01:20:50.760
Is there a first aid kit
around here?

01:20:50.850 --> 01:20:53.520
Well, there might be one in the
fire truck over on the boneyard.

01:20:53.600 --> 01:20:58.060
All right, thanks. You just
stay here and don't panic.

01:20:58.150 --> 01:21:01.270
That's easy for you to say.
You don't gotta take a piss.

01:21:16.210 --> 01:21:18.750
- Let's get it on.
- Oh, yeah, that's nice.
- Lock and load!

01:21:23.170 --> 01:21:26.800
Considering my audience, I'm gonna
make this very quick, very simple.

01:21:26.880 --> 01:21:30.680
This is the boneyard.
This is the hangar.

01:21:30.800 --> 01:21:32.680
This is our plane.

01:21:32.810 --> 01:21:36.560
- What's that?
- That's a rock.

01:21:36.640 --> 01:21:38.440
Okay.

01:21:38.520 --> 01:21:41.900
The convoy will enter
the boneyard through here.

01:21:41.980 --> 01:21:45.400
lnitially, we take out the first car.
Then we take out the last...

01:21:45.480 --> 01:21:48.320
creating a trap,
an airtight cage...

01:21:48.400 --> 01:21:51.780
filled with lots and lots
of dead people.

01:21:51.870 --> 01:21:54.240
Nathan, set everybody
in their position, yeah?

01:21:55.950 --> 01:21:58.460
Bring me
those propane tanks.

01:22:01.210 --> 01:22:04.340
Whoo, go girl.

01:22:04.420 --> 01:22:07.550
Let's go, let's go. Get 'em in there.
if they give you any trouble, kill 'em.

01:22:10.760 --> 01:22:12.590
What can I do?

01:22:12.680 --> 01:22:15.890
Take this. Go into
the boneyard, yeah?

01:22:16.010 --> 01:22:19.430
- Anybody gets through,
you scratch their eyes out.
- You got it.

01:23:11.650 --> 01:23:14.660
Come on, little piggy.

01:23:32.220 --> 01:23:35.260
Closer. Closer. Closer.

01:23:42.310 --> 01:23:45.730
Christ.
They'll be slaughtered.

01:23:47.860 --> 01:23:50.360
This is Larkin.
Tell your men to fall back!

01:23:50.440 --> 01:23:52.360
Now.

01:24:23.430 --> 01:24:26.690
Come on, you stinking
piece-of-shit car!

01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:34.280
- What are you gonna do?
- What you doin', man?

01:24:35.860 --> 01:24:38.030
Well, Baby-O...

01:24:38.120 --> 01:24:41.700
it's not exactly mai tais
and Yahtzee out here, but...

01:24:43.250 --> 01:24:45.870
let's do it!

01:24:56.720 --> 01:24:59.390
Gonna see what happens
now, bitch!

01:24:59.510 --> 01:25:01.010
Bishop.

01:25:13.150 --> 01:25:16.030
- Get the fuck off me!
- I'm gonna bust your ass!

01:25:18.700 --> 01:25:21.700
Leave her alone, man!

01:25:34.090 --> 01:25:36.260
Get behind the truck!

01:25:36.380 --> 01:25:38.180
Get behind the truck!

01:25:57.150 --> 01:26:02.280
- When you wake up, Bishop,
I'll be Johnny 24.
- You wanna fight somebody?

01:26:20.430 --> 01:26:24.850
Don't treat women
like that!

01:26:27.770 --> 01:26:29.310
Aw, shit!

01:26:33.400 --> 01:26:34.820
Whoa! Whoa!

01:26:36.860 --> 01:26:39.570
Get back to the plane!

01:26:42.320 --> 01:26:43.820
Oh, my god!

01:26:59.420 --> 01:27:00.880
Okay!

01:27:02.550 --> 01:27:05.850
You might better
get yourself a seat now.

01:27:10.730 --> 01:27:14.650
- Come on.
- Oh, shit! We're in.

01:27:19.780 --> 01:27:22.030
Just take it and let's go.
Get ready to move.

01:27:28.660 --> 01:27:31.120
We're tied up!

01:27:47.970 --> 01:27:50.560
- Now, come on!
- Okay, I'm comin'.

01:27:53.810 --> 01:27:57.150
- Go for the tires!
- Fuck the tires!
I'm goin' for the pilot!

01:28:09.490 --> 01:28:11.410
lsn't that your car, Malloy?

01:28:11.500 --> 01:28:14.750
Couldn't be.
I left mine at the office.

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:21.170
On any other day,
that might seem strange.

01:28:33.180 --> 01:28:36.650
Gotta get her nose up!

01:29:05.880 --> 01:29:08.550
Fuckers!
Come on!

01:29:08.640 --> 01:29:12.640
- When this is over,
so are you, you little prick!
- Okay.

01:29:20.610 --> 01:29:22.570
Bye-bye, Bob, bye-bye.

01:29:30.910 --> 01:29:32.240
Go, girl!

01:29:32.280 --> 01:29:34.660
Sweet home Alabama

01:29:34.750 --> 01:29:37.290
All right!

01:29:37.410 --> 01:29:39.880
Where the skies
are so blue

01:29:39.960 --> 01:29:42.420
Define irony.

01:29:42.500 --> 01:29:44.670
Bunch of idiots
dancing on a plane...

01:29:44.760 --> 01:29:49.890
to a song made famous by a band
that died in a plane crash.

01:29:57.140 --> 01:29:59.600
ln Birmingham
they love the governor

01:30:02.020 --> 01:30:04.860
We all did
what we could do

01:30:06.440 --> 01:30:11.910
Now Watergate
does not bother me

01:30:11.990 --> 01:30:16.450
Does you conscience bother you
Tell me true

01:30:16.540 --> 01:30:20.540
Sweet home Alabama

01:30:22.710 --> 01:30:27.130
Someone alerted the authorities
at Carson City.

01:30:27.210 --> 01:30:30.180
Someone told them
about our Lerner rendezvous.

01:30:30.300 --> 01:30:33.350
Someone even killed
poor Billy Bedlam.

01:30:33.470 --> 01:30:38.430
Now, could this all
be coincidence? Perhaps.

01:30:38.520 --> 01:30:42.310
Then someone went
and tied a rope to our plane.

01:30:42.400 --> 01:30:46.860
So I ask you,
what is going on?

01:30:46.980 --> 01:30:51.820
And I answer.
We have a traitor in our midst.

01:30:51.910 --> 01:30:55.950
Now, how do we flush
a traitor?

01:30:56.030 --> 01:30:58.870
I don't know,
but at the count of three...

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.420
I will find out who is
on my team and who is not.

01:31:01.500 --> 01:31:03.750
That would be one, two--

01:31:03.830 --> 01:31:07.420
Wait! it was me.

01:31:07.500 --> 01:31:09.210
it was me.

01:31:09.340 --> 01:31:13.340
Don't listen to him, man.
T-T-The insulin made him crazy.

01:31:13.430 --> 01:31:16.560
You have been near death
the entire trip?

01:31:16.680 --> 01:31:19.730
- Yeah, motherfucker, it was me.
- No, he's, he's flipped out,
man. He's nuts.

01:31:19.850 --> 01:31:21.690
it's pretty clever,
huh, bitch?

01:31:21.770 --> 01:31:25.560
- No! Jesus!
- No, that's clever!

01:31:29.070 --> 01:31:32.910
"My daddy is coming home
on July 14th.

01:31:33.030 --> 01:31:36.280
My birthday is July 14th.

01:31:36.370 --> 01:31:39.660
I'm gonna see my daddy
for the first time ever...

01:31:39.750 --> 01:31:43.370
on July 14th.""

01:31:43.460 --> 01:31:45.790
Make a move,
and the bunny gets it.

01:31:51.970 --> 01:31:54.130
- Let's take him out, Larkin.
- Not yet!

01:31:54.220 --> 01:31:55.800
Fire!

01:31:55.890 --> 01:31:57.890
Goddamn it, Malloy!

01:32:00.060 --> 01:32:02.430
- Cease fire!
- Get up here!

01:32:05.600 --> 01:32:08.270
- What are we waiting for?
- That is my plane!

01:32:08.400 --> 01:32:10.610
You got it, Agent Malloy?
You with me?

01:32:10.730 --> 01:32:13.530
Or do you need me to draw it
in crayon, like usual?

01:32:14.740 --> 01:32:17.530
I got a bad feeling, son.

01:32:17.620 --> 01:32:21.580
- I'm feeling like maybe
I'm not supposed to make it.
- You're gonna make it.

01:32:23.660 --> 01:32:26.250
Cyrus Grissom, this is
Special Agent Vince Larkin.

01:32:26.330 --> 01:32:30.750
We will shoot the plane down
if you do not respond now.

01:32:32.590 --> 01:32:36.720
All I can think about is like,
there ain't no God.

01:32:36.800 --> 01:32:39.600
That He don't exist.

01:32:41.930 --> 01:32:46.980
- Hey, where you goin'?
- I'm gonna show you God does exist!

01:32:52.320 --> 01:32:54.110
Fire!

01:32:54.190 --> 01:32:57.410
Malloy, you son of a bitch!
Cease fire!

01:32:58.320 --> 01:32:59.990
Yes!

01:33:02.620 --> 01:33:04.660
Freeze, little bitch boy!

01:33:16.180 --> 01:33:18.180
- Switch to missile.
- Roger that, Two.

01:33:18.300 --> 01:33:20.640
Arming missiles.

01:33:20.720 --> 01:33:22.970
Malloy, don't you do it!
Get in his way.

01:33:23.060 --> 01:33:24.520
Shit!

01:33:26.140 --> 01:33:28.690
What the hell
are you doing, Larkin?

01:33:28.810 --> 01:33:30.860
- I got no move, sir.
- Stupid bastard!

01:33:42.490 --> 01:33:47.710
- No! Poe!
- Land this thing!

01:33:47.830 --> 01:33:51.420
- Where the hell is the Virus?
- I'm the new captain.
Put this thing down.

01:33:51.500 --> 01:33:53.170
Target locked, sir.

01:33:53.250 --> 01:33:56.170
- Oh, yeah!
- Don't you do it!

01:33:56.220 --> 01:33:58.550
- Don't shoot!
- Don't fire.

01:33:58.680 --> 01:34:00.220
- Who is this?
- ldentify yourself.

01:34:00.340 --> 01:34:02.680
- This is Cameron Poe.
- Yes!

01:34:02.720 --> 01:34:04.680
Poe!

01:34:07.180 --> 01:34:09.650
Poe!

01:34:09.730 --> 01:34:13.940
- I repeat, target is locked, sir.
- Malloy, he's got the plane!

01:34:14.020 --> 01:34:18.780
We're not over civilian population.
Now is the time, sir.

01:34:18.860 --> 01:34:21.910
- Don't fire.
- Malloy, listen to him! He's a friend!

01:34:22.030 --> 01:34:24.870
He's just trying to get home
to see his wife and kid! Don't fire!

01:34:24.950 --> 01:34:27.250
Now's the time, sir.

01:34:29.080 --> 01:34:30.790
- Hold fire.
- Sir?

01:34:30.870 --> 01:34:33.630
- I said hold fire!
- Thank you.

01:34:37.550 --> 01:34:39.170
Poe!

01:34:40.880 --> 01:34:42.260
Poe!

01:34:42.390 --> 01:34:45.310
- Cyrus!
- What?

01:34:51.310 --> 01:34:54.360
All right, Poe,
the Las Vegas Airport.

01:34:54.440 --> 01:34:56.940
it's just past the strip.
Can you see it?

01:34:57.070 --> 01:34:59.400
Well, viva Las Vegas.

01:34:59.490 --> 01:35:03.410
it's right there, man. You can
make it. All the runways are
cleared. Come on, do it, Poe.

01:35:03.490 --> 01:35:05.280
Put this thing down.

01:35:05.410 --> 01:35:09.120
Listen here, big daddy.
We got one engine shot to shit...

01:35:09.250 --> 01:35:12.250
zero fuel,
and we're droppin' too fast.

01:35:12.330 --> 01:35:17.000
The strip's where I'm gonna
land. Only the word is crash.

01:35:18.800 --> 01:35:20.920
Should've shot 'em down
over the open desert, Larkin.

01:35:21.010 --> 01:35:23.140
Now the civilian casualties
will be enormous.

01:35:29.430 --> 01:35:34.020
Strap in, ladies. We're goin'
for a night out in Vegas.

01:35:36.020 --> 01:35:40.030
He's got the whole world
in His hands

01:35:40.110 --> 01:35:44.030
He's got the whole world
in His hands

01:35:44.110 --> 01:35:48.160
- He's got the whole wide world
in His hands
- Shut the fuck up, you freak!
We're gonna die!

01:35:50.790 --> 01:35:54.670
- Can he make it to the airport?
- No way, sir.

01:35:57.840 --> 01:36:02.050
All right. We're gonna need
police cars, uh, fire engines,
emergency service vehicles,

01:36:02.130 --> 01:36:05.010
anybody who knows CPR.

01:36:20.400 --> 01:36:22.360
Oh, this is beautiful!

01:36:26.780 --> 01:36:28.740
Wake up, Cyrus!

01:36:28.830 --> 01:36:30.790
ln His hands

01:36:36.960 --> 01:36:38.670
Little, bitty babies

01:36:47.390 --> 01:36:48.970
Cyrus, wake up!

01:36:54.690 --> 01:36:56.980
Stay with me.

01:37:03.360 --> 01:37:07.700
Will the driver of the
white corvette please move
your car or it will be towed.

01:37:07.780 --> 01:37:10.450
We are shit outta road!
I'm outta here!

01:37:24.300 --> 01:37:26.430
Before I kill you, Poe,
I just wanted you to know...

01:37:26.510 --> 01:37:30.350
that the last thing that little
Casey Poe ever gets to smell...

01:37:30.430 --> 01:37:33.520
will be my stinking breath.

01:38:17.480 --> 01:38:19.390
Freeze!

01:38:19.480 --> 01:38:22.770
Okay, lady,
hold it right there!

01:38:56.520 --> 01:39:00.560
- How am I doin', son?
- You're doin' fine.

01:39:13.160 --> 01:39:16.620
Check you out at the hospital,
son. You're gonna be fine.

01:39:39.980 --> 01:39:43.560
- Yeah, this one's dead.
- We better get him outta here.

01:39:47.730 --> 01:39:50.110
So what are you
gonna do now?

01:39:50.190 --> 01:39:54.110
I started this day with a birthday party
to get to, and I'm gonna get to it.

01:40:02.210 --> 01:40:04.370
Thank you.

01:40:04.460 --> 01:40:07.380
You take care,
Sally Bishop.

01:40:08.920 --> 01:40:10.960
Hey, Poe.

01:40:11.050 --> 01:40:13.550
Next time, take the bus.

01:40:20.600 --> 01:40:24.480
Come on, sweetie.
Go with Ginny and your mom.

01:40:31.400 --> 01:40:33.650
- Cyrus.
- Grissom.

01:40:58.680 --> 01:41:00.310
Move!

01:41:33.710 --> 01:41:36.010
Come get it!
Come on now!

01:41:36.090 --> 01:41:37.890
- That gun work?
- Yeah.

01:41:37.970 --> 01:41:40.260
Well, shoot
that piece of shit!

01:42:12.040 --> 01:42:13.880
Jesus!

01:43:07.850 --> 01:43:10.690
- What the hell is that?
- You pull over.

01:43:10.770 --> 01:43:12.480
Yeah, sure.
How 'bout this?

01:43:20.570 --> 01:43:23.910
You ain't gettin' near
my daughter. Buckle up.

01:45:10.720 --> 01:45:13.060
Just so's you know,
Marshal Larkin...

01:45:13.140 --> 01:45:17.060
there's now three men
I trust.

01:45:17.150 --> 01:45:19.310
Am I one of 'em?

01:45:28.910 --> 01:45:31.870
This is a weird thing to be
on a plane full of hard asses.

01:45:33.370 --> 01:45:35.040
- You okay?
- No.

01:45:35.160 --> 01:45:37.500
Good. I'm glad we didn't
shoot it down, huh?

01:45:37.580 --> 01:45:40.040
Oh, yeah, worked out
much better this way.

01:45:41.500 --> 01:45:43.880
Listen, I--

01:45:44.010 --> 01:45:46.840
I wanna apologize
about the car.

01:45:46.930 --> 01:45:49.050
I know a good body shop
in Fresno if it's insured.

01:45:51.510 --> 01:45:54.100
- I was bored with that car anyway.
- it worked out nicely then.

01:46:04.610 --> 01:46:06.400
How do I

01:46:08.070 --> 01:46:11.450
Get through one night
without you

01:46:11.580 --> 01:46:16.080
if I had to live
without you

01:46:16.210 --> 01:46:19.750
What kind of life
would that be

01:46:19.880 --> 01:46:23.420
Oh, now

01:46:23.550 --> 01:46:27.090
I need you in my arms
Need you to hold me

01:46:27.130 --> 01:46:30.430
- Hello, Cameron.
- You're my world, my heart, my soul

01:46:30.550 --> 01:46:35.970
- Hello, hummingbird.
- if you ever leave

01:46:36.100 --> 01:46:39.940
- Baby, you would take away everything
- I meant to get a haircut.

01:46:39.980 --> 01:46:44.070
Good in my life

01:46:44.150 --> 01:46:46.440
I got a present for ya,
Casey.

01:46:50.280 --> 01:46:52.320
Without you

01:46:52.450 --> 01:46:54.910
A little dirty.

01:46:54.990 --> 01:46:57.500
Casey, sweetie, you take
your daddy's present now.

01:46:57.620 --> 01:46:59.830
No, no, no, honey.
it's okay.

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:06.760
I got a picture,
a picture of you.

01:47:08.010 --> 01:47:10.180
I got a picture
of you, too.

01:47:10.300 --> 01:47:13.510
Baby, I don't know
what I would do

01:47:13.640 --> 01:47:16.930
I'd be lost
if I lost you

01:47:17.020 --> 01:47:21.690
if you ever leave

01:47:21.810 --> 01:47:23.360
- Baby, you would take away
- Happy birthday, darlin'.

01:47:23.480 --> 01:47:28.860
Everything real
in my life

01:47:30.450 --> 01:47:33.950
And tell me now

01:47:34.030 --> 01:47:38.790
How do I live
without you

01:47:38.870 --> 01:47:41.710
I want to know

01:47:41.830 --> 01:47:46.000
How do I breathe
without you

01:47:46.130 --> 01:47:49.340
if you ever go

01:47:49.470 --> 01:47:52.300
How do I ever

01:47:52.380 --> 01:47:57.010
Ever survive

01:47:57.140 --> 01:48:00.060
New shooter comin' out, new shooter.
Does the new shooter feel lucky?

01:48:00.140 --> 01:48:03.560
Well, does he?

01:48:03.690 --> 01:48:06.860
Yes, yes he does.
