WEBVTT

00:01.392 --> 00:02.915
<i>Previously on</i> All Rise...

00:02.915 --> 00:04.874
- We should elope.
- You've been putting off

00:04.874 --> 00:06.310
planning our wedding
for months and now suddenly

00:06.310 --> 00:07.964
you want to elope?

00:07.964 --> 00:09.705
You're running
a background check on Andre?

00:09.705 --> 00:11.707
I want to know where he's lived,
his blood type.

00:11.707 --> 00:13.448
So, I'm doing my deep dive.

00:13.448 --> 00:15.406
I need you to stay away
from my wife.

00:15.406 --> 00:17.843
It's gonna be a problem if
I see some shit like that again.

00:17.843 --> 00:19.976
Oh, you saw that?
- Robin! Hi.

00:19.976 --> 00:22.587
Sara, who are you flirt texting?

00:22.587 --> 00:24.589
Spill the tea.

00:24.589 --> 00:27.418
Ah 'kay. Uh, as long as it
doesn't interfere with work,

00:27.418 --> 00:28.724
I really don't care.

00:40.692 --> 00:47.569
<i>♪ Happy birthday, Your Honor ♪</i>

00:47.569 --> 00:51.660
Oh, Sherri. You didn't have to.

00:51.660 --> 00:55.229
Thank you.
Flowers and truffles?

00:55.229 --> 00:58.275
Uh, yes. The flowers
just came from my parents

00:58.275 --> 01:00.625
and the truffles are from Robin.

01:00.625 --> 01:02.584
Oh, so you and Robin are good?

01:02.584 --> 01:04.890
Things are still a little
tender, but we're both trying.

01:04.890 --> 01:07.371
And he's actually taking me to
Mother Wolf tonight for dinner.

01:07.371 --> 01:09.808
No way.
That place is booked out like,

01:09.808 --> 01:11.462
- six months in advance.
- I know.

01:12.594 --> 01:13.943
What's wrong?

01:15.423 --> 01:18.600
It's just... another year
has passed and I have to say,

01:18.600 --> 01:21.559
I am not
terribly proud of myself.

01:21.559 --> 01:24.475
- Oh, Your Honor.
- I mean, when Andre came back

01:24.475 --> 01:26.956
to town, I should have handled
things differently.

01:26.956 --> 01:31.221
But instead I let my emotions
get the better of me... again.

01:31.221 --> 01:35.225
Well, you deserve to knock off
a little early and go home

01:35.225 --> 01:37.662
and relax with Robin
before dinner tonight.

01:37.662 --> 01:40.361
Yeah.

01:40.361 --> 01:42.754
It's just after
two COVID birthdays,

01:42.754 --> 01:44.800
I was really looking forward
to getting together

01:44.800 --> 01:47.455
with my friends and my family,
but I didn't bring it up

01:47.455 --> 01:50.936
because things have been so hot
and cold with Robin.

01:50.936 --> 01:54.244
- Maybe next year?
- Next year.

01:54.244 --> 01:57.726
Okay, unfortunately,
we have a very busy today.

01:57.726 --> 01:59.771
- Hit me.
- Okay.

01:59.771 --> 02:01.338
We have the continuation

02:01.338 --> 02:03.123
of the sushi chef
attempted murder trial,

02:03.123 --> 02:06.126
three motions to review,
and no more procrastinating.

02:06.126 --> 02:08.215
You must complete your judicial
recertification courses

02:08.215 --> 02:10.260
or you're not gonna--

02:10.260 --> 02:13.089
Else, I won't be recertified,
I know. I know.

02:13.089 --> 02:15.918
Wow. Three years went by fast.

02:15.918 --> 02:17.963
Yeah, it has.

02:27.277 --> 02:32.717
- I love that you kept it.
- Oh.

02:32.717 --> 02:36.373
Of course, I kept it. And now
that I'm sort of settled,

02:36.373 --> 02:40.029
he's finally in a place
of pride. I love him.

02:40.029 --> 02:41.639
Do you have
any interesting cases today?

02:41.639 --> 02:44.381
I have a new client
who sideswiped

02:44.381 --> 02:46.166
a private school mom's car.

02:46.166 --> 02:48.342
- You?
- Two low level felony cases.

02:48.342 --> 02:51.040
I should be done
in time for tonight.

02:52.824 --> 02:54.739
This is our first outing
as a couple.

02:54.739 --> 02:57.481
- You ready?
- Absolutely.

02:57.481 --> 02:59.788
- Are you?
- I can't wait.

03:03.052 --> 03:04.662
- Have a good day.
- You, too.

03:20.809 --> 03:24.029
Oh, Chef Hiroto,
Chef Yuma, please, come in.

03:24.029 --> 03:27.642
- Thank you for all this.
- Oh, absolutely.

03:27.642 --> 03:29.818
You know, if anything
happens to you or Kainami Sushi,

03:29.818 --> 03:32.386
Mark will never forgive me, so.

03:32.386 --> 03:36.128
Well, as we've discussed,
your attempted murder charge

03:36.128 --> 03:37.956
is very serious.

03:37.956 --> 03:40.350
You're facing life in prison
if the jury believes

03:40.350 --> 03:42.352
that you tried
to kill your sous chef.

03:42.352 --> 03:45.399
And unfortunately,
the toxicologist that testified

03:45.399 --> 03:47.618
yesterday really
resonated with the jury.

03:47.618 --> 03:50.621
So, tell me a little
more about Paolo.

03:50.621 --> 03:54.582
He was a hard working
and talented disciple.

03:54.582 --> 03:56.192
Are the accounts
of the two of you

03:56.192 --> 03:58.412
having big blowout
arguments true?

03:58.412 --> 04:01.153
I am ashamed to say they are.

04:01.153 --> 04:02.807
What would you argue about?

04:04.679 --> 04:06.333
Me.

04:06.333 --> 04:08.552
Female sushi chefs
are not common,

04:08.552 --> 04:10.598
and my father
only recently decided

04:10.598 --> 04:12.252
to give me the restaurant.

04:12.252 --> 04:17.344
When Yuma proved herself,
I felt it was only right

04:17.344 --> 04:21.609
to leave Kainami to her
instead of Paolo.

04:21.609 --> 04:25.003
I've worked my ass off
to get here. I earned it.

04:25.003 --> 04:30.400
And even though he's got his own
place now, he's still bitter.

04:30.400 --> 04:33.490
My father would never hurt him.
What would be the point?

04:33.490 --> 04:35.405
Revenge.

04:35.405 --> 04:37.494
We have to convince the jury

04:37.494 --> 04:40.323
that your father
wasn't angry at Paolo.

04:40.323 --> 04:45.981
But unfortunately, Chef Hiroto,
you had motive and opportunity,

04:45.981 --> 04:49.071
and the prosecution will try
to use your temper against you.

04:59.037 --> 05:02.171
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:02.171 --> 05:04.652
So, I was thinking
I might have you jump in

05:04.652 --> 05:08.003
and lend Berger a hand
on the sushi case.

05:08.003 --> 05:10.440
- Oh, um...
- Is there a problem?

05:10.440 --> 05:12.312
Well, I know the chef.

05:12.312 --> 05:13.748
He's been feeding me like,

05:13.748 --> 05:15.576
twice a week
for the last five years,

05:15.576 --> 05:17.491
so it could be seen
as a conflict of interest.

05:17.491 --> 05:19.797
Got it. Okay.

05:19.797 --> 05:23.932
Have Palmer as a backup if
Berger needs a hand, all right?

05:23.932 --> 05:26.021
Um, listen, I-- I actually

05:26.021 --> 05:28.066
been meaning to stop
by your office anyway.

05:28.066 --> 05:31.331
Um, I'm sorry it took me
so long, but I finally have

05:31.331 --> 05:33.333
a recommendation for you
for the head DDA position.

05:33.333 --> 05:35.900
- Oh?
- Tony Carver.

05:35.900 --> 05:39.034
Hmm. Well, you're right.
It has been a while.

05:39.034 --> 05:41.602
Which is why
I've already chosen someone.

05:41.602 --> 05:45.432
Wh-- wh-- Uh, who?

05:45.432 --> 05:47.738
I guess now
it's your turn to wait, Callan.

05:52.395 --> 05:53.962
Right.

06:00.011 --> 06:02.013
And it is very important
that you look at the jury

06:02.013 --> 06:03.972
when answering any questions.

06:03.972 --> 06:05.626
Do I really have to testify?

06:05.626 --> 06:07.628
I just want
this whole thing to be over.

06:07.628 --> 06:09.717
I still can't believe
this happened.

06:09.717 --> 06:13.068
Tox reports don't lie.
There were significant traces

06:13.068 --> 06:15.375
of blowfish poisoning in your
system when you ate the food

06:15.375 --> 06:17.115
he prepared for you.

06:17.115 --> 06:19.161
Yeah, I mean you really are
lucky to be alive.

06:19.161 --> 06:20.771
Do I have time
to use the restroom?

06:20.771 --> 06:22.599
Oh, yeah, sure.

06:22.599 --> 06:24.296
Um, it's just actually
around the corner here.

06:25.689 --> 06:28.083
Keep an eye on Paolo.
He seems on edge.

06:28.083 --> 06:30.085
I'll find Ms. Quinn.

06:30.085 --> 06:31.739
- Ms. Quinn!
- Mr. Berger.

06:31.739 --> 06:33.218
Ms. Castillo. Hi.

06:33.218 --> 06:36.091
We have an offer
for your client.

06:36.091 --> 06:38.746
Plead to poisoning food
for human consumption

06:38.746 --> 06:41.226
and we'll dismiss the
attempted murder for two years

06:41.226 --> 06:44.795
of formal probation
and 364 days in county jail.

06:44.795 --> 06:47.581
Thanks, but we'll take
our chances in court.

06:50.235 --> 06:52.760
Paolo really
doesn't want to testify.

06:52.760 --> 06:54.979
Yeah, but now,
we don't have a choice.

07:00.420 --> 07:03.510
- Happy birthday!
- Thank you.

07:03.510 --> 07:05.642
I'm actually finishing up
my last JRC course.

07:05.642 --> 07:07.731
I finally finished
mine last night.

07:07.731 --> 07:10.125
- So jealous.
- Hey, I might need to pick

07:10.125 --> 07:12.606
your brain on
an elder abuse case today.

07:14.042 --> 07:16.436
Oh, I would love to
if I have time.

07:16.436 --> 07:19.221
Sherri has informed me we have
a very packed schedule today.

07:19.221 --> 07:21.919
- Very packed schedule today.
- Hm.

07:21.919 --> 07:23.443
Ah!

07:23.443 --> 07:26.576
Damn it! No.
It got timed out again.

07:26.576 --> 07:29.231
If it helps,
the prompts that make sure

07:29.231 --> 07:32.756
you're watching pop up
at minute 13, 43 and 75.

07:32.756 --> 07:34.497
We'll talk later.

07:35.150 --> 07:36.586
Sherri.

07:42.157 --> 07:44.028
How long did you work
for Kainami Sushi?

07:44.028 --> 07:46.988
I started out
as Chef Hiroto's dishwasher,

07:46.988 --> 07:49.860
and then I spent nearly
ten years as his protege.

07:49.860 --> 07:51.427
And then I went to school

07:51.427 --> 07:53.385
to learn about
restaurant management

07:53.385 --> 07:56.214
'cause Chef was going
to pass Kainami Sushi onto me.

07:56.214 --> 07:58.260
- And did he?
- No.

07:58.260 --> 08:00.480
His daughter, Yuma,
suddenly wanted to play chef,

08:00.480 --> 08:01.916
so I was out.

08:01.916 --> 08:04.048
When an investor
offered me my own place,

08:04.048 --> 08:06.094
I jumped at the chance.

08:06.094 --> 08:08.444
I fused dishes from my Peruvian
heritage with my sushi training.

08:08.444 --> 08:10.185
And you received a Michelin
star for your efforts,

08:10.185 --> 08:11.882
- is that correct?
- Yes.

08:11.882 --> 08:13.884
How long were you open
before you got it?

08:13.884 --> 08:17.279
About a year. A COVID year too,
which was pretty crazy.

08:17.279 --> 08:19.368
And what happened the night

08:19.368 --> 08:21.022
you were awarded
the Michelin star?

08:21.022 --> 08:23.677
I went to celebrate
and make peace with Chef.

08:23.677 --> 08:26.331
So, I sent over
my signature dish.

08:26.331 --> 08:30.205
I guess I was still in the need
of his approval or something.

08:30.205 --> 08:32.773
Anyway, when he replied
with his own dish,

08:32.773 --> 08:34.601
I thought we were
in a better place,

08:34.601 --> 08:37.342
like we had exchanged
olive branches.

08:37.342 --> 08:38.692
What happened next?

08:40.215 --> 08:42.304
Not long after
I finished the dish,

08:42.304 --> 08:45.307
I was rushed to the hospital
with blowfish poisoning.

08:45.307 --> 08:46.787
Thank you.

08:50.486 --> 08:53.228
Chef Hiroto invested a lot
of time in you, didn't he?

08:53.228 --> 08:55.186
Yes.

08:55.186 --> 08:57.667
Was he aware that you were
going to repay him by opening

08:57.667 --> 08:59.451
your own restaurant
just down the street?

08:59.451 --> 09:01.410
I-- It's not
the same food. I wasn't--

09:01.410 --> 09:03.847
Has Chef Hiroto's business
suffered since you've been open?

09:03.847 --> 09:06.241
- Unfortunately, it has--
- And did you ever think--

09:06.241 --> 09:08.504
Your Honor, is she ever going
to let him complete an answer?

09:08.504 --> 09:11.072
Apologies.

09:11.072 --> 09:14.858
Chef Renalto, fugu, or blowfish,
is a specialty

09:14.858 --> 09:17.905
because it's imperative
that the chef avoids puncturing

09:17.905 --> 09:20.908
the ovaries or liver, which
contains the deadly toxins.

09:20.908 --> 09:22.474
- Is that correct?
- Yes.

09:22.474 --> 09:24.346
Well, how'd it taste
that night?

09:24.346 --> 09:27.001
Objection. Is this a joke?
Mr. Renalto could have died.

09:27.001 --> 09:29.307
Your Honor, my client
is up for attempted murder.

09:29.307 --> 09:30.918
I would simply like to know

09:30.918 --> 09:32.354
how the allegedly
poisoned food tasted.

09:32.354 --> 09:34.661
I'll allow it.

09:34.661 --> 09:37.228
Please tell us,
how did it taste?

09:38.316 --> 09:40.057
Fine, I guess.

09:40.057 --> 09:42.625
Um, it was-- it was
with some new pairings

09:42.625 --> 09:44.148
that I didn't recognize.

09:44.148 --> 09:46.107
It was also a crazy night.

09:46.107 --> 09:47.674
I am ashamed
to say that I finished

09:47.674 --> 09:49.327
the dish faster
than I wanted to.

09:49.327 --> 09:51.242
So, is that why
you didn't taste the fugu?

09:51.242 --> 09:54.332
Or is it because Chef Hiroto
knows you don't like fugu,

09:54.332 --> 09:58.032
and in fact, never added it
to the dish he served you.

09:58.032 --> 09:59.729
- What?
- Objection.

09:59.729 --> 10:01.862
Sustained.
No further questions.

10:16.441 --> 10:18.139
- Mrs. Ellington?
- Yes.

10:18.139 --> 10:19.923
Hi, we spoke on the phone.
I'm Emily Lopez.

10:19.923 --> 10:21.795
I've been appointed
to represent you.

10:21.795 --> 10:24.319
Ah, it's nice to meet you.
And please call me Alma.

10:24.319 --> 10:26.669
Okay, Alma. I will.

10:26.669 --> 10:29.454
Alma, why don't
we head right this way.

10:29.454 --> 10:31.718
I'm all set up.
How's your day going?

10:31.718 --> 10:36.113
- Great, um, well, I'm here.
- I know, I know.

10:36.113 --> 10:39.029
We're going to make this
as painless as possible, okay?

10:39.029 --> 10:41.379
- Thank you.
- Okay, Alma.

10:41.379 --> 10:44.469
You are being charged with
felony vandalism

10:44.469 --> 10:46.428
and misdemeanor hit and run

10:46.428 --> 10:49.692
for side swiping
Miss Summer Pilard's Mercedes.

10:49.692 --> 10:51.563
- Do you know her?
- Yes.

10:51.563 --> 10:53.609
Our kids are on the school
lacrosse team together.

10:53.609 --> 10:55.524
Can you tell me what happened?

10:55.524 --> 10:58.135
I was at the field
watching my daughter's game

10:58.135 --> 11:00.094
and I got called back to work.

11:00.094 --> 11:03.880
I, in my rush, just
flew out of the parking lot.

11:03.880 --> 11:06.491
Honestly, I didn't realize
I did any damage.

11:06.491 --> 11:09.407
She reported it because
she claims that you did it

11:09.407 --> 11:12.323
on purpose due
to an argument that you had?

11:12.323 --> 11:14.412
She is so dramatic. Ugh.

11:14.412 --> 11:17.720
We disagreed over
the new uniforms for the team.

11:17.720 --> 11:19.635
It was nothing.

11:19.635 --> 11:23.770
So, the repair bill,
it's-- it's pretty significant.

11:23.770 --> 11:25.597
But, you don't have
any criminal history,

11:25.597 --> 11:27.512
so I'm sure
I can get you a good offer.

11:27.512 --> 11:29.689
But, you will have to pay
for the damages to the car.

11:29.689 --> 11:31.299
- All of them?
- Yes.

11:31.299 --> 11:33.170
Well, doesn't
she have insurance?

11:33.170 --> 11:35.695
I mean, I caused more damage
to my own car,

11:35.695 --> 11:37.305
and that mom is loaded.

11:37.305 --> 11:39.263
Unfortunately,
it doesn't work that way.

11:39.263 --> 11:40.961
Fine. Fine.
I just want it gone.

11:40.961 --> 11:42.919
I want it to go away.

11:44.225 --> 11:45.574
Yeah.

11:47.532 --> 11:49.491
Now, you didn't eat blowfish?

11:49.491 --> 11:52.320
Fugu's a white, delicate fish
with subtle flavor.

11:52.320 --> 11:54.148
When they said
I had fugu poisoning,

11:54.148 --> 11:56.237
I just assumed it was
incorporated into the dish.

11:56.237 --> 11:59.414
Well, are you sure it wasn't?
I mean, maybe he's lying.

11:59.414 --> 12:04.375
- Chef. Please, can we talk?
- After all he did for you?

12:04.375 --> 12:05.986
I hope you're proud of yourself.

12:08.510 --> 12:10.904
It's best not speak to him.

12:18.128 --> 12:21.741
- Oh no, no! Damn it!
- No, no, no. Your Honor.

12:21.741 --> 12:23.394
Oh.

12:23.394 --> 12:25.266
I got distracted
and missed the prompt again.

12:25.266 --> 12:27.050
I'm never going
to finish this thing.

12:27.050 --> 12:29.357
I'm sorry your day is so full
on your birthday.

12:29.357 --> 12:31.402
No, it is not your fault.
It's mine.

12:31.402 --> 12:34.492
I put it off too long,
and here I am.

12:36.407 --> 12:38.801
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

12:38.801 --> 12:42.022
Am I reading too much into it,
or does this plain

12:42.022 --> 12:44.415
"“Happy birthday"” text
from Rachel feel a little odd?

12:44.415 --> 12:46.026
No sorority picture, no Beyonce?

12:46.026 --> 12:48.855
Exactly. Not even
fireworks or heart emoji.

12:48.855 --> 12:52.249
- Yes. Yes, that's weird.
- I'm going out.

12:52.249 --> 12:54.774
- I'll be back in 30.
- What? No, no, no.

12:54.774 --> 12:56.732
No, you have--
Uh, see, you have to finish

12:56.732 --> 12:58.908
your JRC courses, okay?

12:58.908 --> 13:01.563
You-- you have to leave
on time for your--

13:01.563 --> 13:03.652
For your birthday dinner.

13:03.652 --> 13:05.523
Yeah, but I'm in desperate
need of some fresh air

13:05.523 --> 13:07.177
and some froyo.

13:07.177 --> 13:08.875
You know what?
I'll go, you keep working.

13:08.875 --> 13:11.138
Nah, I kind of want
to take the walk.

13:11.138 --> 13:13.662
Promise, I'll be quick.
Strawberry and coffee?

13:13.662 --> 13:18.319
No. Yes, please.
With sprinkles.

13:21.452 --> 13:23.106
So, look.

13:23.106 --> 13:25.630
Alma is a hardworking single mom

13:25.630 --> 13:27.937
with no prior contacts
with law enforcement.

13:27.937 --> 13:30.461
She is regretful and
willing to pay for damages.

13:30.461 --> 13:32.550
This was not a malicious act.

13:32.550 --> 13:35.423
It was a busy mom
who wasn't paying attention.

13:35.423 --> 13:38.469
She pays restitution
for the damages to the car,

13:38.469 --> 13:40.820
one year summary probation
with minimal conditions

13:40.820 --> 13:42.473
for the hit and run misdemeanor.

13:42.473 --> 13:45.259
How about she plead
to the misdemeanor

13:45.259 --> 13:47.478
and earn a dismissal
by paying the restitution?

13:47.478 --> 13:49.350
No, I won't give her
a diversion.

13:49.350 --> 13:51.569
A few months ago, Ms. Ellington
got into another argument

13:51.569 --> 13:54.616
with another parent at her prep
school and slashed her tire.

13:54.616 --> 13:57.837
It seems like your client
has a anger issue.

13:57.837 --> 14:01.405
Uh, uh--
That was not in her rap sheet.

14:01.405 --> 14:03.451
I got a call from the school
about it this morning.

14:03.451 --> 14:06.062
That parent got wind
that Ms. Ellington was trying

14:06.062 --> 14:08.891
to apologize her way out
of this one, too.

14:08.891 --> 14:11.851
Okay. I don't know
anything about that.

14:11.851 --> 14:14.288
But, how about you add
anger management

14:14.288 --> 14:15.942
and allow her to do diversion?

14:15.942 --> 14:18.683
I'm not changing my offer, Lopez.

14:18.683 --> 14:21.425
Fine. Honestly, I don't even
know why I bother sometimes

14:21.425 --> 14:23.384
because I-- It's like,
I can stand here--

14:23.384 --> 14:25.386
You seem agitated.
You all right?

14:25.386 --> 14:27.127
I'm fine. Everything's fine.

14:27.127 --> 14:29.172
'Cause if you want
to tell me anything--

14:29.172 --> 14:31.000
I'm good. Thanks Callan,
pleasure as always.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.959
Have a great day.
Sorry, excuse me. Sorry.

14:32.959 --> 14:34.395
All right. Take care now.

14:35.918 --> 14:38.573
And how long has your father
owned and run Kainami Sushi?

14:38.573 --> 14:40.314
18 years.

14:40.314 --> 14:43.491
His father was a sushi chef,
as was his father.

14:43.491 --> 14:46.363
Kainami is his life
and his legacy.

14:46.363 --> 14:48.626
- Are you a chef there, too?
- Yes.

14:48.626 --> 14:52.456
I, uh, was training in New York
when COVID hit,

14:52.456 --> 14:55.329
and I, uh,
I came home to help out.

14:55.329 --> 14:57.200
But a few weeks
after we reopened,

14:57.200 --> 14:59.202
my father got COVID.

14:59.202 --> 15:01.988
I ran Kainami
while he recovered.

15:01.988 --> 15:04.207
Thank you.

15:04.207 --> 15:06.557
You and your father believe
that Mr. Renalto

15:06.557 --> 15:08.559
is trying to ruin
your father's business, correct?

15:08.559 --> 15:10.257
Objection.
Speculation.

15:10.257 --> 15:12.389
Overruled.

15:12.389 --> 15:15.827
It's a big city, and he opened
a restaurant 200 yards away?

15:15.827 --> 15:17.655
Is that when your father
came up with the plan

15:17.655 --> 15:19.179
to kill his former protege?

15:19.179 --> 15:21.355
- Objection. Speculation.
- Sustained.

15:21.355 --> 15:22.660
No. He would never
risk our lives

15:22.660 --> 15:24.706
or the business for revenge.

15:24.706 --> 15:27.491
Besides, Paolo was like
a son to my father.

15:27.491 --> 15:30.016
Except for when they fought, right?

15:30.016 --> 15:34.324
My father is a perfectionist.
He demands it from all of us.

15:34.324 --> 15:37.110
Is your father known
for arguing with

15:37.110 --> 15:40.156
and ejecting customers who want
to make off menu requests?

15:40.156 --> 15:42.942
Objection. Relevance?
Improper character evidence.

15:42.942 --> 15:46.293
- Overruled.
- Showing you People's Four.

15:46.293 --> 15:48.338
Have you seen your father
behave in this way

15:48.338 --> 15:50.036
towards customers in the past?

15:50.036 --> 15:52.299
<i>Get the hell out.</i>

15:52.299 --> 15:56.129
<i>If you don't respect the food,
you don't deserve to eat it.</i>

15:56.129 --> 15:59.045
<i>You come back,
you will regret it!</i>

15:59.045 --> 16:00.698
<i>Dad.</i>

16:01.569 --> 16:03.179
<i>Dad. Dad!</i>

16:03.179 --> 16:06.400
- Objection. Foundation, hearsay.
- Overruled.

16:15.975 --> 16:17.759
I was able to get you
a decent offer.

16:17.759 --> 16:21.197
You would plead to a misdemeanor
for a year of probation,

16:21.197 --> 16:23.634
and you would have to pay
for the damages to the car.

16:23.634 --> 16:27.029
- Okay. Thank you.
- Okay. Good. You're welcome.

16:28.378 --> 16:32.469
But I-- I do need to ask,
why didn't you tell me

16:32.469 --> 16:35.385
that another mom claims
that you slashed her tire

16:35.385 --> 16:37.213
after an argument
at a PTA meeting?

16:37.213 --> 16:39.302
A complaint was filed
at the school.

16:40.956 --> 16:43.524
Beatrice Ross Miller
is a righteous bitch.

16:43.524 --> 16:46.005
She had the audacity
to accuse me

16:46.005 --> 16:48.094
of stealing from a fund raiser.

16:48.094 --> 16:50.226
- And I just--
- Lost your temper?

16:52.141 --> 16:56.450
I understand that your husband
passed away suddenly last year.

16:56.450 --> 17:02.282
I'm so sorry. How are you
and your daughters holding up?

17:05.111 --> 17:07.635
Anya and Kemi are my light.

17:07.635 --> 17:11.639
They are sweet humans
and great students.

17:11.639 --> 17:15.295
Kemi is a lacrosse player
and Anya is the soccer captain.

17:17.558 --> 17:20.517
Their father never
missed a game,

17:20.517 --> 17:24.347
a recital, a teacher conference.

17:25.479 --> 17:26.871
Not one.

17:28.612 --> 17:33.356
Yeah. Losing him was devastating
for all of us.

17:33.356 --> 17:36.011
I can-- I--
I can only imagine.

17:37.099 --> 17:40.885
- Do you have any kids?
- Uh, no.

17:40.885 --> 17:43.279
Mm-mm. No. No, I don't.

17:43.279 --> 17:45.455
Well, when you do,
you'll understand.

17:45.455 --> 17:49.764
They shape your future and
run your life in the best ways.

17:51.940 --> 17:54.812
Okay.

17:54.812 --> 17:57.163
What are you doing?
You told me you were leaving.

17:57.163 --> 17:58.816
You're supposed to go home,
get ready for dinner.

17:58.816 --> 18:01.036
Ah, I still need
to finish my last course,

18:01.036 --> 18:03.560
so I just skip the champagne and
meet Robin at the restaurant.

18:03.560 --> 18:05.910
Besides, why fight traffic
to get all the way home

18:05.910 --> 18:07.521
just to turn around
and go back to Hollywood?

18:07.521 --> 18:10.524
Right. But don't you
need to change?

18:10.524 --> 18:12.178
What's wrong with
what I'm wearing?

18:12.178 --> 18:15.050
Nothing. Nothing.
You look beautiful.

18:15.050 --> 18:19.054
I just thought
you should relax at home.

18:19.054 --> 18:22.013
I will relax once
I finish my recertification.

18:22.013 --> 18:24.103
But you, go.

18:24.103 --> 18:26.322
I know how much you hate leaving
your dad alone at night.

18:26.322 --> 18:28.368
No. You know,
I'll stay with you.

18:28.368 --> 18:31.719
No. Just because I'm stuck here
doesn't mean you should be.

18:31.719 --> 18:35.157
Now, take a truffle and go home.

18:35.157 --> 18:38.247
- Tell your dad I said, "“Hi."”
- Thank you.

18:39.205 --> 18:42.295
Mmm, yum, deli--
Happy birthday.

18:42.295 --> 18:44.819
Thank you. Good night.
Good night.

18:45.994 --> 18:48.257
- Hi, beautiful.
- Hi. You ready?

18:48.257 --> 18:50.129
We are going to be late.

18:52.087 --> 18:54.220
This is the second time
today Vic has texted me.

18:54.220 --> 18:56.657
Your dad reaching out
isn't a bad thing, Mark.

18:56.657 --> 18:58.963
This is Vic
we're talking about, Amy.

18:58.963 --> 19:01.096
Any time he reaches out
is suspect.

19:01.096 --> 19:02.924
Maybe he's asking
about the wedding.

19:02.924 --> 19:04.795
Oh, speaking of which,
did you get the rough draft

19:04.795 --> 19:06.449
of the Save the Date
I emailed you today?

19:06.449 --> 19:08.756
- What Save the Date?
- You didn't get it?

19:08.756 --> 19:10.279
No.

19:10.279 --> 19:11.976
- Really, you've got to go.
- All right.

19:18.200 --> 19:19.636
Change of plans.

19:25.555 --> 19:26.861
Hi.

19:26.861 --> 19:28.906
- You okay?
- Yeah.

19:28.906 --> 19:30.995
You're lucky Sherri just left
and didn't catch you back here

19:30.995 --> 19:34.347
because I can't talk,
but, hi.

19:34.347 --> 19:37.306
I wanted to take you out
for your birthday.

19:37.306 --> 19:39.265
Oh, thank you Mark, thanks.

19:39.265 --> 19:40.918
But, once I finish
this requirement,

19:40.918 --> 19:42.659
I'm meeting Robin
at Mother Wolf for dinner.

19:42.659 --> 19:46.620
- Uh, pre-dinner drinks?
- I really can't.

19:46.620 --> 19:49.057
Well, that's a shame
because I was...

19:50.928 --> 19:53.931
I was going to ask if you,
you want to be my best woman?

19:55.063 --> 19:57.065
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

19:57.065 --> 20:01.417
I would be honored.

20:01.417 --> 20:04.725
- Well, let's celebrate.
- I really want to, I do.

20:04.725 --> 20:07.031
But I gotta finish
this last requirement.

20:09.164 --> 20:11.993
Ugh. And this man.

20:11.993 --> 20:13.603
What-- what man?

20:14.691 --> 20:16.171
Andre.

20:16.171 --> 20:18.391
This is his second
birthday text.

20:18.391 --> 20:20.219
Damn, I really thought
that man would have been done

20:20.219 --> 20:22.003
for good after the uh--

20:22.003 --> 20:23.570
Thought he'd be done
for good after what?

20:23.570 --> 20:26.573
Uh-uh. Come on.
Out with it.

20:26.573 --> 20:31.665
Amy might have overheard
Robin warn Andre to

20:31.665 --> 20:33.928
stay away from you.

20:33.928 --> 20:36.931
Excuse me?
When did this happen?

20:36.931 --> 20:38.585
Last week in the H.O.J.

20:38.585 --> 20:41.414
Last week!
Are you serious?

20:41.414 --> 20:43.329
- Yes--
- Robin didn't say anything.

20:43.329 --> 20:45.244
Please don't tell him
I told you--

20:45.244 --> 20:47.333
I cannot believe that I am
just now hearing about this.

20:47.333 --> 20:49.509
I can not believe this man.
How could he wait two weeks?

20:49.509 --> 20:51.424
- It was not my place.
- And you know and I--

20:51.424 --> 20:53.426
Robin Michael Alan Taylor.

20:55.079 --> 20:58.082
Goodness.
Why is it so dark in here?

20:58.082 --> 20:59.997
Surprise!

21:02.348 --> 21:06.047
What is going on?
Oh my God.

21:07.266 --> 21:09.006
Happy birthday, beautiful.

21:09.006 --> 21:12.880
Husband, how did you know
I secretly wanted a party?

21:12.880 --> 21:14.577
'Cause I know my wife.

21:14.577 --> 21:16.840
Moses has been situated
in the guest house.

21:16.840 --> 21:20.191
- Tonight is all about you.
- Oh my gosh. Thank you.

21:21.280 --> 21:23.934
Hey! Oh my--

21:23.934 --> 21:29.505
Uncle Dwayne. I can't!
Hey, Cirie! What's up, Jack?

21:29.505 --> 21:32.552
- Is Rachel here?
- No, she couldn't make it.

21:32.552 --> 21:35.294
Really? I thought that's
why she didn't call.

21:36.382 --> 21:38.558
- Hey, baby.
- Oh! Hello.

21:38.558 --> 21:41.212
And your cohort here
made up some crazy story

21:41.212 --> 21:44.303
about you confronting
Andre to get me here.

21:44.303 --> 21:46.914
- Not funny.
- He what?

21:46.914 --> 21:49.133
- I know.
- Happy birthday.

21:49.133 --> 21:51.571
And this is why you were
working so hard

21:51.571 --> 21:53.399
to get me out of the office.

21:53.399 --> 21:56.402
Guilty as charged.
This is-- this is all Robin.

21:56.402 --> 21:58.882
I wanted to introduce you
to my father, Henry Park.

21:58.882 --> 22:00.754
Happy birthday,
Judge Carmichael.

22:00.754 --> 22:03.800
Professor Park, it is
a pleasure to finally meet you.

22:03.800 --> 22:05.976
- Please call me Lola.
- Thank you, Lola.

22:05.976 --> 22:07.761
What the hell?
- I'm sorry, man.

22:07.761 --> 22:09.937
I was-- I was trying to get
her out of the office,

22:09.937 --> 22:11.547
and then it just--

22:11.547 --> 22:13.157
- It slipped out.
- It slipped out?

22:13.157 --> 22:14.768
Well, at least
she's here, right?

22:14.768 --> 22:16.422
I'm sorry.

22:18.511 --> 22:21.427
Oh, Clayton.
District Attorney Bravo.

22:21.427 --> 22:23.603
Sorry we're late.
Happy birthday, Your Honor.

22:23.603 --> 22:26.562
Happy birthday.
Uh, and no impropriety here.

22:26.562 --> 22:28.347
We met the delivery guy
on the way in.

22:28.347 --> 22:30.349
Thank you.
Uh, come on in.

22:30.349 --> 22:32.916
Yeah. Uh, where's your bar?

22:32.916 --> 22:35.832
In the kitchen. Okay.

22:38.313 --> 22:40.315
Just uh, remember the plan.

22:40.315 --> 22:42.926
Please don't mention
anything about

22:42.926 --> 22:44.493
the Linden community, okay?

22:44.493 --> 22:47.235
I keep my private life
very private.

22:47.235 --> 22:50.064
Hey, uh, who's that gentleman
with the flowers?

22:50.064 --> 22:51.718
Uh, District Attorney
Louis Bravo.

22:51.718 --> 22:54.198
- Mmm. Is he single?
- Oh my God, Dad, please.

22:54.198 --> 22:55.852
I'm literally begging you.

22:55.852 --> 22:57.898
I was just trying to--

22:57.898 --> 23:00.901
<i>♪ Honey, I want to
feel your touch ♪</i>

23:00.901 --> 23:02.816
<i>♪ Wanna get to know ya ♪</i>

23:02.816 --> 23:05.209
I don't know if Lola
believed me, but, well,

23:05.209 --> 23:07.386
I'm telling you,
you need to be upfront with her.

23:07.386 --> 23:10.563
I know, I know. I'll talk
to her after the party.

23:10.563 --> 23:13.609
- Hey, beautiful.
- Hey, handsome.

23:14.741 --> 23:17.700
I cannot believe
how much she's grown.

23:17.700 --> 23:19.398
- I mean, it's--
- I know, crazy, right?

23:19.398 --> 23:21.748
It all goes so fast.
Okay, out with it.

23:21.748 --> 23:24.620
What's going on? You, Amy,
and Robin have been exchanging

23:24.620 --> 23:26.143
weird looks all night.

23:26.143 --> 23:28.015
Nothing is going on.
It was just--

23:31.018 --> 23:32.846
I can always tell
when you're lying,

23:32.846 --> 23:34.891
which is why we can no
longer play poker, Callan.

23:34.891 --> 23:36.719
So, fess up.

23:36.719 --> 23:38.373
He's put so much work
into this party.

23:38.373 --> 23:41.985
I promise you,
it's not a big deal, okay?

23:41.985 --> 23:43.422
I promise you.

23:54.389 --> 23:56.565
Assertive, I like that.

23:56.565 --> 23:58.524
Listen, we gotta hurry, baby,
if we're going to get--

24:01.440 --> 24:03.659
Is there something
you want to tell me?

24:06.662 --> 24:08.142
Oh.

24:09.796 --> 24:11.537
Fine.

24:14.888 --> 24:17.107
It's true.

24:17.107 --> 24:19.545
I told Andre to stay
the fuck away from you.

24:23.287 --> 24:24.941
Why did you do that?

24:24.941 --> 24:26.856
Why did I tell your
ex-boyfriend to back off?

24:26.856 --> 24:28.728
Are you being serious right now?

24:28.728 --> 24:30.512
I thought we were going
to start communicating more.

24:30.512 --> 24:32.645
I did, communicate to him.

24:32.645 --> 24:34.603
Look, I'm sorry if
you have a problem with it,

24:34.603 --> 24:36.083
but enough was enough.

24:36.083 --> 24:37.867
Look, I understand
why you did it.

24:37.867 --> 24:39.956
I just don't understand
why you wouldn't tell me.

24:39.956 --> 24:42.698
Look, if we are rebuilding
our trust,

24:42.698 --> 24:44.395
you should have told me.

24:44.395 --> 24:46.528
Okay, but trust is
a two-way street, Lo.

24:46.528 --> 24:48.922
I gave you the space
to deal with him.

24:48.922 --> 24:52.273
You didn't.
So, I handled it.

24:53.970 --> 24:59.541
I'm protecting my family,
and I'd do it again.

25:03.545 --> 25:06.679
You're right.
You're right.

25:06.679 --> 25:08.463
I'm sorry.

25:08.463 --> 25:10.552
And I would have probably
have done the same.

25:12.902 --> 25:17.559
And I promise I will deal
with Andre once and for all.

25:18.517 --> 25:20.519
Okay.

25:20.519 --> 25:23.217
- I love you.
- And I love you.

25:30.790 --> 25:34.010
- Mmm.
- Okay. Okay.

25:34.010 --> 25:37.144
Hey, baby, as much as I want to
keep you in this room right now,

25:37.144 --> 25:39.538
we have a house full of people
trying to celebrate you.

25:41.191 --> 25:43.672
Okay. To be continued?

25:43.672 --> 25:45.282
Absolutely.

25:47.415 --> 25:49.678
Mmm mmm mmm.
You gonna get it.

25:52.028 --> 25:54.204
Gary's sorry
he couldn't make it.

25:54.204 --> 25:56.424
He's at a yoga retreat
in New Zealand.

25:56.424 --> 25:58.948
New Zealand?
What does Gary--

25:58.948 --> 26:02.517
Thank you so much for the invite
to the wedding.

26:02.517 --> 26:05.128
I feel honored, truly.

26:05.128 --> 26:09.089
Oh, of course, Judge Delgado,
we are honored to have you.

26:09.089 --> 26:11.657
Me, too. And please let me know
where you're registered.

26:11.657 --> 26:13.528
You both--

26:13.528 --> 26:15.399
Oh, you've got to get
your flowers downtown. Trust.

26:15.399 --> 26:17.097
And if you haven't gotten
a caterer,

26:17.097 --> 26:19.012
my cousin's got mad skills.

26:19.012 --> 26:20.579
Yes. Oh, he is amazing.

26:20.579 --> 26:22.450
My niece
is a great photographer.

26:22.450 --> 26:24.278
She's not cheap,
but she's the best.

26:24.278 --> 26:26.889
And a band is the way to go.

26:26.889 --> 26:29.109
Oh yeah. I had a DJ and a band.

26:29.109 --> 26:31.285
Oh! Look at you.

26:31.285 --> 26:33.417
I think I accidentally
sent the Save the Date

26:33.417 --> 26:35.202
to the entire H.O.J.

26:37.378 --> 26:39.162
How are you going
to uninvite the entire H.O.J.

26:39.162 --> 26:40.860
to your wedding?

26:40.860 --> 26:43.340
Maybe that can be the job
of my new best woman?

26:43.340 --> 26:46.430
Yeah, no, I don't think so.

26:46.430 --> 26:49.216
You having a good time?
Huh? You enjoying yourself?

26:49.216 --> 26:53.481
Yeah, um,
I hate to sound petty.

26:53.481 --> 26:56.049
but ever since college,

26:56.049 --> 26:59.487
Rachel and I have made
a big deal about our birthdays.

26:59.487 --> 27:03.404
I'm talking spa days,
girls trips, amazing dinners.

27:03.404 --> 27:06.668
- Did you two talk?
- Just a generic text.

27:06.668 --> 27:09.540
I mean,
she's been so distant lately.

27:09.540 --> 27:12.195
I think that whole Andre thing
hit her harder

27:12.195 --> 27:13.632
than you understand.

27:16.286 --> 27:18.288
She's in love with him,
isn't she?

27:20.769 --> 27:25.644

28:03.246 --> 28:05.074
Isn't he your favorite
sushi chef?

28:05.074 --> 28:07.903
I can separate
my work obligations

28:07.903 --> 28:11.124
from my love for hand rolls.

28:11.124 --> 28:13.604
Fair enough. Well, since
the victim might have gotten

28:13.604 --> 28:17.565
blowfish poisoning without
blowfish, we're modifying.

28:17.565 --> 28:20.786
Sometimes it helps to come at
it from a different way.

28:20.786 --> 28:23.614
- Clean slate.
- Hmm.

28:23.614 --> 28:25.616
Oh, excuse me.

28:25.616 --> 28:27.314
Clean slate.

28:29.795 --> 28:31.666
Are you blushing right now?

28:31.666 --> 28:33.712
- Was that your mystery man?
- Oh, my God.

28:33.712 --> 28:35.409
You need to tell me who this is.

28:35.409 --> 28:37.324
- This is-- this is just cruel.
- All right. Okay.

28:37.324 --> 28:39.979
- It's Gabriel.
- Who's Gabriel?

28:39.979 --> 28:42.198
You know, my--
my client from like,

28:42.198 --> 28:44.374
a few weeks back with the--

28:44.374 --> 28:46.637
- Oh. That Gabriel.
- Mm-hmm.

28:46.637 --> 28:50.554
Oh, uh, do you think that
that's a good idea though?

28:50.554 --> 28:53.775
Dating clients is like a-- It's
a huge conflict of interest.

28:53.775 --> 28:56.256
No, we are not dating.

28:56.256 --> 29:01.435
- Just... Just be careful.
- I will. Thank you.

29:02.784 --> 29:05.526
Man, you and Luke
must be doing great

29:05.526 --> 29:09.008
because you just have
a whole glow going on.

29:09.704 --> 29:12.751
I'm glowing? Oh, fuck.

29:12.751 --> 29:15.666
What? What's wrong?

29:21.455 --> 29:23.152
I'm seven days late, Sara.

29:23.152 --> 29:24.719
I'm seven days late,
and I'm never late.

29:24.719 --> 29:26.242
- Like, I'm never--
- Okay.

29:26.242 --> 29:27.940
Okay, look,
that doesn't necessarily

29:27.940 --> 29:32.466
- mean you're pregnant.
- No, I... I could be.

29:43.259 --> 29:45.000
I'm sorry.

29:45.000 --> 29:48.134
This is not how
I was going to tell you.

29:48.134 --> 29:50.136
Not that there's
anything to tell.

29:50.136 --> 29:52.486
I haven't taken a test yet,
and it's probably a false alarm.

29:52.486 --> 29:54.531
I mean, we-- we were safe.
We're always safe.

29:54.531 --> 29:56.795
And you know what? I didn't
want to stress you out

29:56.795 --> 29:58.448
before I knew for sure.

30:00.320 --> 30:03.932
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry.

30:03.932 --> 30:06.413
Is there anything
I can do to help?

30:06.413 --> 30:09.720
No. No, I will--
I'll get a test tomorrow

30:09.720 --> 30:12.767
and then we'll know
for sure. Okay?

30:13.942 --> 30:16.466
- Good night, guys.
- Good night.

30:16.466 --> 30:18.425
Like Bobby
kind of deal?

30:18.425 --> 30:20.731
How are you still on that?
You have to explain that.

30:20.731 --> 30:22.864
You guys get home safe.
- Night. Night.

30:22.864 --> 30:25.258
- Thanks, Callan.

People's Eight. Is this
your father's fuguhiki knife?

31:38.113 --> 31:40.463
Uh, yes.

31:40.463 --> 31:43.684
Is it true that is only
used to cut blowfish?

31:43.684 --> 31:45.512
Yes.

31:45.512 --> 31:48.602
Did your father use
the fuguhiki to cut

31:48.602 --> 31:51.605
any other fish when he prepared
for Mr. Renalto's dish?

31:51.605 --> 31:53.563
A fuguhiki is never used
to cut any other fish,

31:53.563 --> 31:55.565
even after it's cleaned.

31:55.565 --> 31:57.306
But what if it did?

31:57.306 --> 32:00.222
Had fugu or blowfish
been served that night?

32:00.222 --> 32:01.832
- Yes.
- Who prepared it?

32:01.832 --> 32:03.443
My father.

32:03.443 --> 32:05.924
Is it possible
the fuguhiki transferred

32:05.924 --> 32:08.056
the blowfish poison
to another cut of fish?

32:08.056 --> 32:10.232
Objection. Speculation
and foundation ground.

32:10.232 --> 32:13.496
She is an expert.
She would know if it's possible.

32:13.496 --> 32:15.411
Overruled. You may answer.

32:17.674 --> 32:20.373
Yes, it could happen.

32:20.373 --> 32:22.331
Did your father try
to disguise his actions

32:22.331 --> 32:25.204
by not serving Mr. Renalto
actual blowfish,

32:25.204 --> 32:27.902
but another fish laced
with blowfish poison?

32:27.902 --> 32:30.122
- Objection. Speculation.
- Sustained.

32:30.122 --> 32:32.385
Thank you.
No further questions.

32:32.385 --> 32:34.909
Ms. Quinn.

32:34.909 --> 32:38.086
How has your father been feeling
since he had COVID?

32:42.308 --> 32:43.744
Ms. Kudo?

32:45.572 --> 32:48.879
Um, he got a bad case,

32:50.185 --> 32:53.232
and is still not quite himself.

32:53.232 --> 32:57.540
He has limited smell
and suffers from brain fog.

33:05.766 --> 33:08.508
Has it affected his work?

33:11.119 --> 33:13.382
In small ways,
yes, it has.

33:15.428 --> 33:21.129
He could be um, less organized
and forgetful at times.

33:21.129 --> 33:24.263
Thank you.
Nothing further, Your Honor.

33:36.666 --> 33:39.191
- Alma.
- Thank you for coming in.

33:39.191 --> 33:43.978
We just have to look over
this waiver form together,

33:43.978 --> 33:48.243
and I will just need you
to initial and sign, please.

33:51.638 --> 33:55.250
I also wanted to let you know
that we offer

33:55.250 --> 33:57.209
emotional support
counseling services--

33:57.209 --> 33:59.646
Excuse me? Counseling?

33:59.646 --> 34:01.430
I'm not some head case
off the street.

34:01.430 --> 34:03.345
You do realize that.

34:03.345 --> 34:07.088
But Alma, you qualified
for a public defender,

34:07.088 --> 34:09.873
which means that you are
struggling financially.

34:09.873 --> 34:14.487
And more importantly,
I suspect emotionally.

34:18.578 --> 34:21.929
My husband was my best friend.

34:21.929 --> 34:24.062
When he died,
I found out he invested

34:24.062 --> 34:26.673
all of our money
and lost everything.

34:26.673 --> 34:29.458
So, I do not appreciate
being shamed

34:29.458 --> 34:32.461
for requesting free counsel,
which is my right.

34:32.461 --> 34:34.594
Hold on a second.
Alma, that's not what I--

34:34.594 --> 34:36.204
I am so sorry.

34:36.204 --> 34:39.903
I cannot imagine
how hard this has been,

34:39.903 --> 34:42.819
but therapy could help.

34:42.819 --> 34:49.348
Yeah, well, I don't have
the time or the resources.

34:49.348 --> 34:52.351
So, sitting on some couch
complaining about my life

34:52.351 --> 34:57.051
isn't going to pay the mortgage
or the kids' tuition.

34:57.051 --> 35:00.620
Thank you for negotiating
the plea agreement.

35:00.620 --> 35:02.317
I appreciate your time.

35:10.586 --> 35:12.893
I understand that you're
unable to reach a verdict.

35:12.893 --> 35:14.895
- Is that correct?
- Yes, Your Honor.

35:14.895 --> 35:16.853
Do you think additional
time deliberating

35:16.853 --> 35:18.464
would assist the jury?

35:18.464 --> 35:21.684
- No, I do not, Your Honor.
- Very well.

35:21.684 --> 35:25.210
Then I will find that the jury
is hopelessly deadlocked.

35:25.210 --> 35:29.301
You all are excused from further
jury service in this case.

35:29.301 --> 35:30.867
Thank you for your service.

35:32.652 --> 35:34.393
Your Honor,
the defense would like

35:34.393 --> 35:36.090
to make a motion to dismiss.

35:36.090 --> 35:37.570
Mr. Berger?

35:37.570 --> 35:39.746
We oppose the motion,
Your Honor.

35:41.400 --> 35:43.402
I will take the motion
under submission.

35:45.143 --> 35:48.624
In the meantime, I think
this is an opportune time

35:48.624 --> 35:51.061
to reflect on
what makes a family.

35:52.193 --> 35:55.196
Some of the strongest bonds
we have

35:55.196 --> 35:57.590
are not limited to people
we share bloodline with.

35:57.590 --> 36:03.117
Our chosen family can be just as
significant, if not more so.

36:03.117 --> 36:07.643
Mr. Kudo, Ms. Kudo, Mr. Renalto,
perhaps you will take

36:07.643 --> 36:10.211
this additional time
that you've been afforded

36:10.211 --> 36:13.171
to have an open
and honest conversation.

36:13.171 --> 36:14.781
It's at least worth a try

36:14.781 --> 36:16.783
before 12 new strangers
decide your fate.

36:17.697 --> 36:19.220
We are adjourned.

36:21.353 --> 36:24.486
What if it was an accident?
Will the charges be dropped?

36:24.486 --> 36:27.185
Um, without proof,
I-- I don't think so.

36:28.621 --> 36:30.144
Am I allowed to speak to Hiroto?

36:30.144 --> 36:32.886
Oh, well,
I don't know if I would.

36:57.563 --> 36:59.086
I'm sorry.

37:11.925 --> 37:16.582
- Ah!
- Oh, wow. Yes. Thank you!

37:16.582 --> 37:18.366
- I am starving.
- Mm-hmm.

37:20.063 --> 37:22.544
- I got your favorite.
- Thank you.

37:22.544 --> 37:24.372
Yas.

37:26.026 --> 37:31.901
- So, um-- Did you uh--
- Uh, not yet.

37:31.901 --> 37:33.338
But, I will.

37:34.948 --> 37:37.951
So, I realize that we uh...

37:37.951 --> 37:39.735
We haven't had
the kid conversation.

37:39.735 --> 37:41.607
I know. I know,

37:41.607 --> 37:44.740
and this isn't exactly
the most ideal place to have it.

37:44.740 --> 37:47.917
But, okay, the truth is,

37:47.917 --> 37:51.617
I have never had
a burning desire to be a mom.

37:53.749 --> 37:56.012
Really? Wow.

37:56.012 --> 37:59.755
I always assumed you wanted
a big family with like,

37:59.755 --> 38:01.801
eight kids and three dogs.

38:01.801 --> 38:05.892
Me? No.

38:05.892 --> 38:09.896
- Is that what you want?
- Not eight, for sure, but...

38:10.636 --> 38:12.855
Oh. Um...

38:15.293 --> 38:16.685
Honestly, um,

38:18.165 --> 38:22.212
I just-- I just
never planned on having kids.

38:22.212 --> 38:26.086
I just-- I love this.

38:26.086 --> 38:27.870
I-- I love what we do.
I love it.

38:27.870 --> 38:31.439
It's-- it's a part of me,
and I am dedicated to it.

38:31.439 --> 38:33.746
Maybe I'll feel differently
one day.

38:33.746 --> 38:37.837
But right now, I just--
I don't see kids in my life.

38:37.837 --> 38:40.405
I just, I-- I don't.

38:40.405 --> 38:43.190
How-- how do you feel?

38:44.234 --> 38:46.106
Well--

38:51.372 --> 38:52.895
Damn, I am so sorry.

38:52.895 --> 38:54.810
I need to help Carol
put out a fire.

38:54.810 --> 38:57.073
- I'll be back soon.
- Yeah.

38:57.073 --> 38:59.206
Save me an eggroll.

38:59.206 --> 39:00.686
I promise.

39:07.736 --> 39:09.738
Berger. The jury deadlocked?

39:09.738 --> 39:13.002
Yes. Ms. Quinn
made a motion to dismiss,

39:13.002 --> 39:14.961
and Judge Carmichael took it
under submission.

39:14.961 --> 39:16.745
What do you recommend?

39:16.745 --> 39:18.921
The tox report is solid
and the chef's temper

39:18.921 --> 39:20.662
is well documented.

39:20.662 --> 39:22.534
It's also possible
the chef may have hid

39:22.534 --> 39:24.492
the blowfish poison
in another cut of fish,

39:24.492 --> 39:26.755
but there's no way to prove
that it wasn't just a mistake.

39:26.755 --> 39:28.583
Doesn't seem like we have
a strong enough case anymore.

39:28.583 --> 39:30.498
Let's dismiss.
Are you sure?

39:30.498 --> 39:33.458
- We can still--
- I'm sure, but uh, good work.

39:34.546 --> 39:35.851
Callan.

39:39.289 --> 39:42.336
It must be killing you to not
know who he's going to pick.

39:42.336 --> 39:44.947
Should have
taken your shot, Mark.
