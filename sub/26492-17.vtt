00:01.029 --> 00:02.414
Previously on Riverdale...

00:02.416 --> 00:05.378
Your mom can't start dealing drugs
without a lab to make them in.

00:05.381 --> 00:06.880
Your mother and I are separating.

00:06.883 --> 00:08.239
You always say,

00:08.241 --> 00:10.936
"Family is the most important thing."

00:10.939 --> 00:12.460
There is no family anymore.

00:12.463 --> 00:14.796
Today, the Serpents start a new chapter.

00:14.798 --> 00:17.437
You're no longer outlaws,
you're law keepers.

00:17.440 --> 00:18.357
Are you Kurtz?

00:18.360 --> 00:20.542
You're all wanted for making
and dealing Fizzle Rocks.

00:20.545 --> 00:22.020
Only the worthy will ascend.

00:22.023 --> 00:24.799
Mr. Lodge gave me a list of the
places his dealers used to go to,

00:24.802 --> 00:26.381
where G&G players congregate.

00:26.384 --> 00:28.176
I have someone who can help you.

00:28.179 --> 00:29.760
A friend of mine from the Farm.

00:29.763 --> 00:33.866
Groups like the Farm prey on
emotionally vulnerable people.

00:33.869 --> 00:36.242
You're actually buying this Farm crap

00:36.245 --> 00:39.413
that some huckster named
Edgar Evernever is selling you?

00:39.415 --> 00:41.396
You don't just meet Edgar.

00:44.161 --> 00:45.652
I knew my dad would like it.

00:50.593 --> 00:52.643
Perimeter's clear.

00:52.646 --> 00:53.821
Moving in.

01:18.689 --> 01:20.683
- Sweet Pea, duck!
- Bang, bang!

01:20.686 --> 01:21.702
You're both dead.

01:21.705 --> 01:23.236
Always check your six, Deputies.

01:23.239 --> 01:24.537
It's a deadly mistake.

01:24.540 --> 01:27.269
This is just a simulation, but you
don't get any do-overs on the street.

01:27.271 --> 01:30.439
Which makes it all the more obvious
that you boys aren't ready for them.

01:30.441 --> 01:33.701
You wanna stop the rogue
Gargoyles? Work as a team.

01:33.703 --> 01:35.369
Till you've proven you can do that,

01:35.371 --> 01:36.778
I'm not letting you out there.

01:36.780 --> 01:37.788
Do it again.

01:40.324 --> 01:41.458
Let's go, Jug.

01:43.796 --> 01:48.029
Is there any way that maybe you can
see this divorce as a good thing?

01:48.032 --> 01:51.551
I'm trying to find a lining of
even tarnished silver, but...

01:52.844 --> 01:54.327
my parents raised me to believe

01:54.330 --> 01:57.414
that family is the most
important thing in the world.

01:57.417 --> 01:59.167
I'm so sorry, Vee.

02:03.715 --> 02:06.239
Veronica, hi. Do you mind
if I hang some fliers?

02:06.242 --> 02:07.901
The Farm's having an
open house tomorrow.

02:07.903 --> 02:09.127
An open house?

02:09.130 --> 02:11.387
Yes, we are opening
our doors to visitors.

02:11.389 --> 02:13.932
Everyone is welcome to
tour our renovated premises,

02:13.934 --> 02:17.535
meet with Farm elders and learn
about our values and practices.

02:17.538 --> 02:19.437
Go ahead, Evelyn.

02:19.439 --> 02:20.537
Thank you.

02:24.228 --> 02:26.068
Of course I'll go with you.

02:29.233 --> 02:30.407
Hey, hon.

02:31.151 --> 02:33.235
Why the long face?

02:33.237 --> 02:36.497
One of my deputies
found our old trailer...

02:36.499 --> 02:39.057
or what was left of it.
It was burned to a crisp.

02:40.244 --> 02:43.694
They found drug cooking material inside.

02:43.697 --> 02:44.755
Oh, my.

02:45.958 --> 02:47.341
In our trailer?

02:47.343 --> 02:49.868
Our little town can't
seem to catch a break.

02:49.870 --> 02:52.179
Remove one cancer, another
one takes its place.

02:54.207 --> 02:58.482
Come on, Dad, we're missing
the Saturday morning cartoons.

02:59.293 --> 03:00.396
All right.

03:05.936 --> 03:07.844
Did you really think

03:07.846 --> 03:11.681
that blowing up that decrepit
trailer would change anything?

03:11.683 --> 03:13.433
Oh, I'm not gonna stop

03:13.435 --> 03:17.037
until you are out of Riverdale.

03:17.039 --> 03:19.064
Well, you better buckle up then,

03:19.066 --> 03:20.986
'cause I ain't going anywhere.

03:25.363 --> 03:26.755
And here's a tip.

03:28.200 --> 03:29.758
Don't cross me again.

03:37.876 --> 03:39.647
If you cross over this way,

03:39.650 --> 03:43.296
here you will find two of our more
artistic members expressing themselves.

03:43.298 --> 03:45.474
- Hi, Megan. Hi, Garrett.
- Hi.

03:45.476 --> 03:49.044
At the Farm, we like to nurture
everyone's unique talents.

03:50.406 --> 03:53.598
It's like Hockney meets Heaven's Gate.

03:53.600 --> 03:56.392
Now, would anyone like to
guess what this room's used for?

03:56.394 --> 03:57.986
Ritualistic drownings?

03:57.988 --> 03:59.687
Sorry, Betty. I didn't hear you.

03:59.689 --> 04:00.772
Hey, what's behind there?

04:00.774 --> 04:03.200
That is just the janitor's closet.

04:03.202 --> 04:06.322
Now, if everyone will follow
me, I'll show you the garden.

04:09.925 --> 04:12.501
- Betty!
- Mom.

04:12.503 --> 04:15.343
Go ahead, Vee. I'll catch
up with you in a bit.

04:16.289 --> 04:18.248
I didn't think you would come.

04:18.250 --> 04:20.309
Well, everyone's welcome, so...

04:22.361 --> 04:25.037
Well, enjoy the rest of your tour.

04:26.424 --> 04:27.566
Wait.

04:28.301 --> 04:29.425
That's it?

04:29.427 --> 04:32.095
We haven't talked in forever,

04:32.097 --> 04:33.346
and that's all I get?

04:33.348 --> 04:34.931
"Enjoy the rest of your tour"?

04:34.933 --> 04:37.451
You forsook me, Betty,

04:37.453 --> 04:38.881
not the other way around.

04:40.021 --> 04:41.361
So if you'll excuse me.

04:45.318 --> 04:46.418
Hi.

04:48.414 --> 04:51.614
Would you be interested in one
of our quick and easy interviews?

04:53.043 --> 04:55.043
Uh, yeah. Sounds great.

04:55.045 --> 04:56.205
If you'll follow me then.

05:00.167 --> 05:04.603
Betty. These interviews are for
people interested in joining the Farm.

05:04.606 --> 05:06.189
Well, let's say that I am.

05:07.890 --> 05:09.315
Where's your dad, by the way?

05:09.318 --> 05:10.526
He's around.

05:13.013 --> 05:15.490
Well, let's get started, shall we?

05:15.493 --> 05:16.782
Name?

05:18.059 --> 05:19.243
Betty Cooper.

05:20.854 --> 05:23.372
- Occupation?
- Student.

05:26.410 --> 05:28.502
Do you ever bite your fingernails?

05:28.505 --> 05:29.712
Sometimes.

05:30.697 --> 05:32.447
Do you ever feel stressed?

05:32.449 --> 05:33.832
Sure.

05:33.834 --> 05:35.300
Doesn't everyone?

05:40.388 --> 05:42.823
Would you consider
yourself a cold person?

05:44.001 --> 05:45.227
No.

05:48.765 --> 05:50.265
Okay.

05:50.267 --> 05:52.508
Great. Thank you.

05:52.510 --> 05:55.270
Is that it? Aren't you going
to ask me about my secrets?

05:55.272 --> 05:57.272
No, that's all we need for now. Thanks.

05:57.274 --> 05:58.407
We'll call you.

06:03.578 --> 06:06.196
No, I should be there,
if only for appearances.

06:08.568 --> 06:09.793
Damn it, Hiram!

06:11.713 --> 06:13.204
Mom.

06:13.207 --> 06:16.151
Your father is finally opening
that damn prison of his.

06:16.154 --> 06:17.915
There's gonna be a
ribbon-cutting ceremony

06:17.918 --> 06:19.876
with Governor Dooley in attendance.

06:19.879 --> 06:23.131
And he has very selfishly
decided that I, the Mayor,

06:23.133 --> 06:25.058
am not invited.

06:25.060 --> 06:29.471
Well, you did try to kill him, twice.

06:29.473 --> 06:32.183
It's just a photo op, Mom. Don't spiral.

06:32.186 --> 06:35.569
No, Veronica, you don't understand.

06:35.571 --> 06:39.072
It's just a matter of time before our
enemies find out about the divorce.

06:39.074 --> 06:40.982
Without Hiram's protection,

06:40.984 --> 06:42.984
my life could be in danger.

06:42.986 --> 06:45.520
Why would they go after you?

06:45.522 --> 06:48.490
I've made moves. There
are people with grudges.

06:48.492 --> 06:50.583
In our line of work,

06:50.586 --> 06:52.944
when a marriage unravels,

06:52.946 --> 06:56.446
the wife of a mafia boss often simply...

06:56.449 --> 06:57.870
just disappears.

07:01.494 --> 07:03.305
One good thing about being your neighbor

07:03.307 --> 07:05.601
is I got two kitchens
to raid for grub now.

07:06.584 --> 07:08.459
Yeah, no worries, Jug.

07:08.461 --> 07:09.794
How's it going with your mom?

07:09.796 --> 07:11.455
It's cold war.

07:11.457 --> 07:14.257
I mean, the nuclear option is
that I tell my dad everything,

07:14.259 --> 07:16.851
but that could spell
mutually-assured destruction.

07:16.853 --> 07:20.405
So instead, the Serpents and I are just
dismantling her drug trade piece by piece.

07:20.407 --> 07:25.777
Up next, we're gonna drive the Gargoyles
out of town, and her cook Kurtz.

07:25.779 --> 07:30.898
I am gonna make Riverdale a very
unwelcome place for Gladys Jones.

07:30.900 --> 07:33.100
And if she does go, what
happens to Jellybean?

07:33.820 --> 07:35.695
Still need to figure that out.

07:40.676 --> 07:41.918
Hello.

07:41.921 --> 07:43.826
Would you accept a collect call

07:43.829 --> 07:46.446
from the Leopold and Loeb
Juvenile Detention Center?

07:47.309 --> 07:48.642
Uh... sure.

07:50.312 --> 07:52.232
- Archie, it's Mad Dog.
- Mad Dog?

07:53.314 --> 07:56.298
- Dude, what's up?
- I need your help.

07:56.301 --> 08:00.729
The drug trade has reared its
ugly head in Riverdale yet again.

08:00.731 --> 08:02.489
Now, my dad doesn't think we're ready,

08:02.491 --> 08:04.899
but we're going to be
Riverdale's unofficial DEA.

08:04.901 --> 08:07.185
That means we're gonna make
life miserable for the Gargoyles

08:07.187 --> 08:08.644
and run them out of our town.

08:08.646 --> 08:10.363
But first,

08:10.365 --> 08:11.790
we're gonna hit the hotspots.

08:11.793 --> 08:14.702
Make sure Gladys isn't using any
of Hiram's old infrastructure.

08:16.166 --> 08:18.088
Mad Dog, what's happening?

08:18.090 --> 08:19.739
They're finally shutting down L&L.

08:19.741 --> 08:20.748
That's great.

08:20.751 --> 08:22.176
Because of what happened
to Warden Norton?

08:22.178 --> 08:23.473
That's what they're saying.
But really, it's 'cause

08:23.475 --> 08:25.418
they're opening up that
new prison on the Southside.

08:25.420 --> 08:26.758
Hiram Lodge's private prison.

08:28.040 --> 08:29.515
But that's not for juveniles.

08:29.518 --> 08:30.817
Apparently a wing of it is.

08:30.819 --> 08:32.385
We're all being transferred there, Red.

08:32.386 --> 08:35.299
And the L&L guards who
made us fight here...

08:35.303 --> 08:37.249
they're all gonna work over there.

08:37.251 --> 08:39.258
They're gonna start
the fight club again?

08:39.260 --> 08:41.653
My parole hearing was
canceled out of the blue.

08:41.655 --> 08:43.530
Baby Teeth, Thumper... theirs, too.

08:43.532 --> 08:45.014
They're doing whatever it takes

08:45.016 --> 08:47.200
to fill Lodge's cells come opening day.

08:48.987 --> 08:50.495
I tried to call my family,

08:51.688 --> 08:53.397
but no one's answering.

08:53.400 --> 08:54.949
Well, Mad Dog, listen to me.

08:54.951 --> 08:58.528
You risked your life to help me escape.

08:58.530 --> 09:02.257
Believe me when I say you will not
step one foot in Hiram Lodge's prison.

09:03.562 --> 09:06.960
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

09:10.425 --> 09:13.376
Nice digs, Archie.

09:13.378 --> 09:15.628
So my dad just gave you this gym?

09:15.630 --> 09:17.230
Well, it's a long story.

09:19.634 --> 09:21.778
Ronnie, Mad Dog and the other guys

09:21.781 --> 09:23.515
can't be transferred
to your dad's prison.

09:23.518 --> 09:25.054
Those guards are sadists.

09:25.056 --> 09:26.835
You worked so hard to
get me out of there.

09:26.838 --> 09:28.558
I broke you out. Remember?

09:28.560 --> 09:29.912
Yeah, but before that.

09:29.915 --> 09:33.412
You worked with the Innocence
Project petitioning the Governor.

09:33.415 --> 09:34.939
As a matter of fact,

09:34.941 --> 09:38.151
I happen to know that
Governor Dooley is in town.

09:38.153 --> 09:40.712
Perhaps an appeal in
person might do the trick.

09:42.574 --> 09:45.324
Hope the traffic wasn't
too bad, Governor Dooley.

09:45.327 --> 09:46.447
Right this way.

09:50.789 --> 09:52.747
What is this?

09:52.750 --> 09:54.959
I thought I was sitting
down with your father.

09:54.961 --> 09:57.510
No. That was a pretense
to lure you in here.

09:57.513 --> 09:59.880
This is my ex-boyfriend, Archie Andrews.

09:59.883 --> 10:02.475
Governor, I need to speak to
you about the transfer of inmates

10:02.477 --> 10:05.136
from Leopold and Loeb
Juvenile Detention Center

10:05.138 --> 10:07.255
to Hiram Lodge's private prison.

10:07.258 --> 10:08.740
You can't let it happen.

10:08.742 --> 10:10.128
I don't know who you people are,

10:10.131 --> 10:11.649
but I'm not staying here for this.

10:11.652 --> 10:16.530
Walk and I take my story to every 24-hour
news channel and paper in the tri-state.

10:16.533 --> 10:18.508
What story?

10:18.510 --> 10:22.871
While my friends and I were forced
to box for L&L's illegal fight club,

10:22.873 --> 10:26.866
you and Warden Norton were at
fundraisers having lobster dinners.

10:26.868 --> 10:29.785
And there are five other
inmates who will swear

10:29.787 --> 10:32.028
that you attended these illegal fights

10:32.031 --> 10:34.364
with Warden Norton
as his personal guest.

10:34.367 --> 10:35.959
They'll testify in court.

10:37.003 --> 10:39.646
What exactly do you expect me to do?

10:39.648 --> 10:41.940
You're the governor, aren't you?

10:43.059 --> 10:45.332
Pardon them. Today.

10:52.477 --> 10:54.995
Thank you for agreeing
to help me, Cheryl.

10:54.997 --> 10:56.917
I haven't agreed to anything yet.

10:57.972 --> 10:59.409
Infiltrating the Farm...

10:59.412 --> 11:01.772
Isn't this more a mission for
you and your beanie-headed beau?

11:01.774 --> 11:04.695
I've already tried. But
Evelyn doesn't trust me.

11:04.697 --> 11:08.249
She was, however, definitely trying
to woo you during the musical.

11:08.251 --> 11:09.867
What's your obsession with the Farm?

11:09.869 --> 11:11.369
Yes, they wear white after Labor Day,

11:11.371 --> 11:12.830
but beyond that, are
they really that horrible?

11:12.832 --> 11:14.364
They're a cult, Cheryl.

11:14.366 --> 11:17.091
And it's not just my friends
and family that they've targeted.

11:17.093 --> 11:19.093
Juniper and Dagwood,
your niece and nephew,

11:19.095 --> 11:21.337
are being raised as toddler Farmies.

11:21.339 --> 11:24.098
And looked perfectly happy and
healthy last time I saw them.

11:26.344 --> 11:27.444
What about Jason?

11:29.013 --> 11:32.181
He told Polly they were
running away to the Farm.

11:32.183 --> 11:34.100
Don't you wanna know why?

11:34.102 --> 11:35.911
Please, Cheryl, believe me.

11:35.913 --> 11:37.996
If I could go undercover, I would.

11:44.362 --> 11:45.437
Hello?

11:48.550 --> 11:50.133
Is everything okay?

12:02.213 --> 12:03.344
Oh, Cheryl.

12:04.424 --> 12:06.307
What is it? Is there anything I can do?

12:06.309 --> 12:07.651
It's over.

12:09.596 --> 12:11.404
Toni and I broke up again.

12:12.557 --> 12:13.907
For good this time.

12:14.910 --> 12:17.727
I don't know what to do.

12:17.729 --> 12:20.889
You know, it might help you
to talk about it with a friend.

12:25.236 --> 12:26.402
I'm in, cousin.

12:36.220 --> 12:37.685
Hey, man.

12:37.688 --> 12:39.153
Can I help you?

12:39.156 --> 12:42.009
Yeah. Do you, uh, do you
think I could get a little...

12:42.012 --> 12:43.311
game enhancement?

12:47.592 --> 12:50.053
That's a limited edition.

12:51.229 --> 12:52.320
50 bucks.

12:56.234 --> 12:57.659
Everything good?

12:57.661 --> 12:58.759
Not for you.

13:01.623 --> 13:04.082
Hey, there. Remember me?

13:04.084 --> 13:06.317
Last time I was here
with the Red Paladin.

13:06.319 --> 13:09.152
And that day I was in a good mood.

13:09.155 --> 13:10.397
But today...

13:10.399 --> 13:12.323
...I'm in a bad mood.

13:12.325 --> 13:14.158
But you can help me
with that by telling me

13:14.160 --> 13:15.493
where all these drugs are coming from.

13:15.495 --> 13:16.827
The Gargoyles are dealing again.

13:16.829 --> 13:18.120
Where are they selling from?

13:18.123 --> 13:19.431
We've been to all the hotspots.

13:19.434 --> 13:21.999
No, it's old school. Street corners.

13:22.001 --> 13:24.248
But you can tell by
the gargoyles on wires.

13:25.646 --> 13:28.005
What the hell does that mean?

13:28.007 --> 13:30.650
In some cities, when you see a
pair of sneakers on telephone wires,

13:30.652 --> 13:33.177
it means that there's a drug
den nearby. But he's saying...

13:33.179 --> 13:34.729
Look for gargoyles instead of shoes.

13:34.731 --> 13:35.864
Okay.

13:35.866 --> 13:36.983
Search this place.

13:36.986 --> 13:39.783
Confiscate any contraband
or drugs or gaming equipment.

13:39.786 --> 13:42.370
Don't make me come back here.

13:42.372 --> 13:44.980
And how exactly did you
obtain all this detective gear,

13:44.982 --> 13:47.500
- Betty Snooper?
- My mom had a box of this stuff

13:47.502 --> 13:50.078
from when she worked at
The Riverdale Register.

13:50.080 --> 13:51.335
Done.

13:51.338 --> 13:53.463
Now all you have to
do is just go in there

13:53.466 --> 13:55.650
and be yourself.

13:55.653 --> 13:57.469
Keep the conversation going.

13:57.472 --> 14:00.440
Answer all of their
questions honestly, okay?

14:04.426 --> 14:05.592
What's your favorite color?

14:05.595 --> 14:08.003
Red, obvi. But if I had to specify,

14:08.005 --> 14:10.322
I'd say Pantone's "Flame Scarlet."

14:10.325 --> 14:13.251
Do you ever bite your fingernails
or cuticles when you're stressed?

14:13.254 --> 14:14.444
No.

14:14.446 --> 14:16.286
My manicurist would kill me.

14:17.306 --> 14:19.724
Dad. Hi.

14:19.726 --> 14:21.392
Oh, my God.

14:21.394 --> 14:23.161
This is Cheryl Blossom.

14:25.940 --> 14:27.820
It's nice to meet you, Cheryl.

14:28.683 --> 14:30.043
Thank you, honey.

14:31.282 --> 14:33.571
My dad will be finishing
your interview now.

14:33.573 --> 14:35.048
You're in good hands.

14:35.050 --> 14:36.615
Shall we jump back in?

14:38.494 --> 14:41.412
Have you ever experienced
a loss of a loved one?

14:41.414 --> 14:43.581
Yeah. My brother Jason.

14:43.583 --> 14:46.959
And when he passed, did you
find yourself able to grieve?

14:46.961 --> 14:49.081
Honestly there's so
much I don't remember.

14:49.973 --> 14:52.473
I was in a dark place.

14:52.475 --> 14:54.425
Elucidate that for me.

14:54.434 --> 14:56.118
Jason was my twin.

14:57.596 --> 15:00.513
And when I lost him, I
lost a piece of myself.

15:00.516 --> 15:03.693
I wanted so desperately to
reunite with him that I...

15:03.695 --> 15:06.520
found myself on the frozen
bed of Sweetwater River.

15:06.522 --> 15:08.402
When I fell through the ice,

15:09.951 --> 15:11.370
I saw him down there.

15:12.538 --> 15:15.214
Afterwards, I was changed.

15:15.217 --> 15:18.340
It was like my spirit had
finally returned to my body.

15:18.343 --> 15:21.223
So much so that I burned
down my childhood home.

15:22.471 --> 15:24.457
So you've already been baptized.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.736
And been reborn in fire.

15:28.628 --> 15:30.328
I... I suppose.

15:30.330 --> 15:33.570
But yet the memory of your
brother, it still hurts, doesn't it?

15:35.927 --> 15:36.943
Cheryl...

15:38.905 --> 15:40.864
memories are often painful.

15:42.809 --> 15:44.649
But they don't have to be.

15:45.787 --> 15:47.787
They can be a...

15:47.789 --> 15:49.870
a path to revival.

15:51.984 --> 15:54.627
I believe the Farm
can help you see that.

15:56.690 --> 15:58.356
I gotta give you props, Red.

15:58.359 --> 16:00.309
One minute we're headed
to Hiram's prison,

16:00.312 --> 16:02.751
and the next we're walking
out of L&L, time served.

16:03.546 --> 16:05.467
Now you're out, what's next?

16:05.470 --> 16:06.786
What's the plan?

16:06.789 --> 16:09.669
I'm gonna go find my family.

16:11.260 --> 16:12.962
Some of these guys got no place to go.

16:12.964 --> 16:14.804
I mean, I got no one, so...

16:17.635 --> 16:19.515
Hey, don't worry, Baby Teeth.

16:20.741 --> 16:22.135
Think I got a place.

16:23.900 --> 16:25.780
Sweet.

16:27.904 --> 16:29.687
It's not fancy,

16:29.689 --> 16:32.406
but it's a hell of a lot
better than a cell in L&L.

16:32.408 --> 16:34.817
Set some cots up around the place.

16:34.819 --> 16:37.003
You guys can stay as long as you want.

16:37.005 --> 16:38.671
This is yours?

16:38.673 --> 16:41.174
- You own a gym?
- It's a long story.

16:41.176 --> 16:43.009
Guys, this is Mr. Keller.

16:43.011 --> 16:44.660
Trainer extraordinaire.

16:45.808 --> 16:48.014
Mr. Keller, these are the guys
I was talking to you about.

16:48.016 --> 16:49.254
Good to meet you, fellas.

16:49.256 --> 16:51.912
Glad to see that Archie's gonna finally
have some competition around here.

16:56.549 --> 16:58.287
Mad Dog, what do you say?

16:58.290 --> 17:00.440
Jonesing for a rematch?

17:00.443 --> 17:03.483
So long as there's no
guards betting on us.

17:06.517 --> 17:08.337
All right, what's your 20?

17:08.339 --> 17:10.019
We broomed out the Gargoyles

17:10.021 --> 17:12.372
at the intersection of Baker and Main.

17:12.374 --> 17:14.574
Good work, Sweet Pea.
Move to the next corner.

17:17.287 --> 17:18.452
Lovers' Lane is all clear.

17:18.454 --> 17:19.694
Gargoyles took off quick.

17:19.696 --> 17:21.289
Copy that, Fangs.

17:21.290 --> 17:23.124
Took care of Sixth and Benedict, boss.

17:23.126 --> 17:24.657
Great job, keep it up.

17:24.660 --> 17:25.820
What you got for me?

17:26.579 --> 17:28.378
First and Maple? Nice work.

17:29.464 --> 17:31.948
Got it. Well done, James.

17:31.951 --> 17:34.433
One more corner to go if you
wanna get in on the action.

17:34.435 --> 17:36.184
I'll meet you there, Sweet Pea.

17:44.263 --> 17:45.596
Hey!

17:46.733 --> 17:48.074
No, no, no. Hold up.

17:48.076 --> 17:49.640
We're just here for the Gargoyle.

17:49.643 --> 17:50.910
You screwed up, kid.

17:51.663 --> 17:53.129
Damn it!

17:53.132 --> 17:54.622
You ruined my bust.

17:54.625 --> 17:56.665
What the hell are you thinking, boy?

18:00.613 --> 18:01.904
What the hell were you thinking?

18:01.906 --> 18:03.147
Are you out of your mind?

18:03.149 --> 18:05.240
He was gonna lead me
to the cook! To Kurtz!

18:05.242 --> 18:06.867
You asked me to be your eyes and ears.

18:06.869 --> 18:08.619
I told you to report back to me!

18:08.621 --> 18:10.597
What the hell is going on here?

18:10.599 --> 18:12.790
We can hear you all
the way up in JB's room.

18:12.792 --> 18:16.126
Your son thought that he could
cure Riverdale's drug problem

18:16.128 --> 18:18.168
by cracking a few skulls, didn't you?

18:19.173 --> 18:20.640
I had it under control.

18:20.642 --> 18:22.762
You know, Jughead, maybe
your father is right.

18:22.765 --> 18:25.028
If it's as dangerous as he says it is,

18:25.030 --> 18:27.859
maybe this whole deputy program...

18:27.862 --> 18:29.807
maybe it's not such a
good idea for the Serpents.

18:29.809 --> 18:30.961
Your mother's right, boy.

18:30.964 --> 18:32.463
No, don't listen to her.

18:35.147 --> 18:37.106
If I see or hear

18:37.108 --> 18:40.275
about any other Serpents trying to
take the law into their own hands again,

18:40.277 --> 18:43.253
I swear, I'll throw your asses in jail.

18:47.696 --> 18:50.882
Looks like you'll be sitting
the next few rounds out, sugar.

18:58.295 --> 19:00.087
Keller trained you up good, huh, Red?

19:00.089 --> 19:01.380
Yeah, a little.

19:04.826 --> 19:06.635
What the hell are you doing here, Elio?

19:06.637 --> 19:09.138
I heard this old gym had
reopened. Thought I'd drop by.

19:09.140 --> 19:10.973
Quite the stable of
fighters you got here.

19:10.975 --> 19:13.701
If I'm not mistaken, I've seen
a few of these faces before.

19:13.703 --> 19:15.789
- Who's this clown?
- He's a crook.

19:15.792 --> 19:17.008
No one you need to know.

19:17.011 --> 19:18.960
I'm a boxing manager
looking for new talent.

19:18.963 --> 19:21.167
So, the moment you boys wanna
start earning some cash money,

19:21.169 --> 19:22.568
come see me at Casa Grande Gym.

19:22.570 --> 19:24.987
Elio, no one here is
looking for your business.

19:24.989 --> 19:26.622
Okay? So take a hike.

19:26.624 --> 19:28.992
Leave, or I'll throw
your ass out myself.

19:35.358 --> 19:37.118
Mom, Dad...

19:37.835 --> 19:39.001
I have an idea.

19:39.003 --> 19:40.393
If you're open to it,

19:40.396 --> 19:43.005
I think you should consider
seeing a marriage counselor.

19:43.007 --> 19:45.174
- Veronica...
- You want us in therapy?

19:45.176 --> 19:47.843
You wouldn't be the first
mobster to see a therapist, Daddy.

19:47.846 --> 19:50.438
There is nothing for us to discuss.

19:50.440 --> 19:54.283
Maybe I should call the Monsignor
to remind you that marriage

19:54.285 --> 19:57.257
is ordained by God, and
therefore, non-negotiable.

19:58.531 --> 20:00.489
Mom, what do you think?
You have the most to lose.

20:00.491 --> 20:04.994
Veronica, I'm not gonna beg for
forgiveness or mercy from your father.

20:04.996 --> 20:06.462
He's clearly given up.

20:07.290 --> 20:09.073
Well, I haven't.

20:09.075 --> 20:11.408
I'm still fighting for this family

20:11.410 --> 20:14.369
after everything. After...

20:14.371 --> 20:17.465
How many times did
you try to kill Archie?

20:17.467 --> 20:19.041
Water under the bridge.

20:19.043 --> 20:22.520
Really? You trying
to murder my boyfriend

20:23.422 --> 20:24.987
is water under the bridge?

20:29.103 --> 20:30.753
You raised me to believe

20:30.755 --> 20:34.240
that family was the most
important thing in the whole world.

20:34.242 --> 20:36.767
And I stupidly believed it.

20:36.769 --> 20:38.734
And it cost me Archie.

20:38.737 --> 20:41.730
When he came back and
you were in the hospital,

20:41.732 --> 20:43.398
I chose you over Archie.

20:43.401 --> 20:46.017
I broke up with him because
you were on death's door.

20:46.020 --> 20:48.670
And I thought, "We need to
come together, all of us.

20:48.673 --> 20:51.758
We need to rally around
Daddy and give him strength...

20:52.785 --> 20:54.948
so that he doesn't die." And now...

20:56.020 --> 20:58.412
you have the gall

20:58.415 --> 21:00.345
to break apart our family.

21:02.253 --> 21:03.567
You made your point.

21:05.005 --> 21:08.172
But this ship has sailed, mija.

21:08.175 --> 21:10.679
So grow up and accept it.

21:13.573 --> 21:14.930
What's he like?

21:14.932 --> 21:16.473
Younger than I thought.

21:16.475 --> 21:18.776
Also, count him among
the Hot Dads of Riverdale,

21:18.778 --> 21:22.604
because Mr. Evernever is a yummy snack.

21:22.606 --> 21:24.123
He's also a great listener.

21:24.125 --> 21:26.316
Cheryl, this is huge.

21:26.318 --> 21:27.841
You're in with Edgar,

21:27.844 --> 21:30.704
which means I have a few questions
I need you to ask him, okay?

21:30.706 --> 21:33.374
Why did Edgar decide to
come to Riverdale now,

21:33.376 --> 21:36.677
and how many members does he plan on
recruiting? And most importantly...

21:36.679 --> 21:40.047
Excuse you! We are having
a private conversation.

21:40.049 --> 21:41.474
Can you leave?

21:43.627 --> 21:44.835
Go on, cousin.

21:44.837 --> 21:46.795
You said Edgar recorded your interview.

21:46.797 --> 21:49.173
I need you to find out
where he stores those tapes.

21:49.175 --> 21:51.067
If I can get my hands
on my mom and Polly's,

21:51.069 --> 21:53.802
then the Farm won't have
any leverage over my family.

21:53.804 --> 21:54.987
I'll try my best.

21:55.806 --> 21:57.565
TBH,

21:57.567 --> 21:59.527
I kinda enjoyed talking to Eddie.

22:00.822 --> 22:04.021
I swear, if I never eat anything
other than these burgers again,

22:04.023 --> 22:06.143
I'd die a happy man.

22:07.544 --> 22:10.545
Hey, Mad Dog. You all right?

22:10.547 --> 22:13.581
I finally found my
grandma and little brother.

22:13.583 --> 22:16.491
They moved into some apartment
building that's falling apart.

22:16.493 --> 22:19.736
It's been taken over by
drug dealers in weird masks.

22:19.739 --> 22:22.698
- What, like gargoyle masks?
- Yeah.

22:22.701 --> 22:25.250
They're cooking drugs out
of some vacant apartments

22:25.252 --> 22:27.098
and my grandma and
brother are right there.

22:27.101 --> 22:28.356
We'll get them out.

22:28.359 --> 22:30.172
What, we're gonna move
my family into the gym?

22:30.174 --> 22:32.216
No, not your family.

22:32.218 --> 22:34.426
I'm talking about the Gargoyles.

22:34.428 --> 22:36.468
We're gonna get rid of the Gargoyles.

22:55.216 --> 22:57.282
It was right there on my desk.

22:57.284 --> 22:59.244
I got the message loud and clear.

23:00.246 --> 23:01.470
They want me dead.

23:02.498 --> 23:03.914
Who?

23:03.916 --> 23:06.250
Someone looking for payback.

23:06.252 --> 23:09.519
One of our enemies.
Maybe the St. Clairs.

23:09.522 --> 23:10.855
Or your father.

23:11.987 --> 23:13.587
Oh, my God, Mom.

23:19.927 --> 23:21.574
I drove past the building.

23:21.576 --> 23:22.875
Jug, Mad Dog was right.

23:22.878 --> 23:24.911
I saw Gargoyles coming in and
out like they own the place.

23:24.913 --> 23:26.770
- How many?
- A lot.

23:26.772 --> 23:28.753
That must be where Kurtz
is doing his cooking.

23:28.756 --> 23:29.778
Well, should we go to your dad?

23:29.780 --> 23:31.275
No, that's the nuclear option.

23:31.277 --> 23:32.280
Remember?

23:32.283 --> 23:34.619
Besides, my dad doesn't
even want us on the street.

23:34.622 --> 23:35.700
I'll talk to the guys.

23:35.703 --> 23:38.621
See if they're willing to risk
their necks against the Gargoyles.

23:38.624 --> 23:39.908
Or my dad for that matter.

23:39.910 --> 23:41.001
Well, count us in, too.

23:41.003 --> 23:42.786
Me, Mad Dog and the crew.

23:42.788 --> 23:43.954
They can fight.

23:43.956 --> 23:46.076
- Every last one of them.
- More the merrier.

23:48.719 --> 23:51.378
Before we begin, Mr. Evernever,

23:51.380 --> 23:53.255
may I ask you a question?

23:53.257 --> 23:55.966
These tapes you're
making, what are they for?

23:55.968 --> 23:59.803
Many of our members like to refer
back to them from time to time.

23:59.805 --> 24:01.230
Track their growth.

24:01.232 --> 24:04.226
And where do you store these tapes?

24:05.477 --> 24:07.064
In a secure location.

24:07.067 --> 24:08.815
On the premises?

24:13.786 --> 24:16.962
Why are you so concerned
about the tapes, Cheryl?

24:17.781 --> 24:21.062
Oh. No. No concern.

24:21.827 --> 24:24.494
Just... curious.

24:24.496 --> 24:26.539
Curious? Hmm.

24:26.542 --> 24:28.707
Before we get back to the interview, uh,

24:28.709 --> 24:30.959
I'd like to show you something first.

24:30.961 --> 24:33.001
Something I think you'll find very...

24:35.034 --> 24:36.274
illuminating.

24:38.344 --> 24:41.011
- If you'll follow me.
- I'd be honored.

24:41.013 --> 24:42.304
Cheryl...

24:42.306 --> 24:43.850
No, no, no, no, no.

24:43.853 --> 24:45.848
It's just down this hall.

24:45.851 --> 24:48.352
You asked about our
files. They're right here.

24:48.354 --> 24:50.979
But that looks like a broom closet.

24:50.981 --> 24:54.575
Tomorrow night we're having a
get together for new members.

24:54.577 --> 24:56.380
Will you join us?

24:56.383 --> 24:59.338
Sounds unmissable. Will
all of the Farmies be there?

24:59.340 --> 25:01.531
Ah! Here we are.

25:02.701 --> 25:03.801
After you.

25:04.838 --> 25:06.702
Uh, wait.

25:06.705 --> 25:07.871
What happens in here?

25:22.887 --> 25:25.554
Cheryl, I called you a dozen times.

25:25.557 --> 25:26.681
I was beyond worried.

25:26.683 --> 25:28.725
Why? I texted you I was fine.

25:28.727 --> 25:31.478
Well, what was in that
room Edgar took you to?

25:31.480 --> 25:33.355
None of your business.

25:33.357 --> 25:35.065
Also, I'm done being your mole.

25:35.067 --> 25:37.840
It's disrespectful,
not to mention illegal.

25:38.765 --> 25:40.695
Okay. Well, I was gonna
say the same thing.

25:40.697 --> 25:43.382
You should stop going to the Farm
before Edgar catches on to you.

25:43.384 --> 25:45.459
Oh, I'm still going to go.

25:45.461 --> 25:47.219
I'm just done working for you.

25:47.221 --> 25:49.107
- Cheryl...
- Toodles!

25:57.297 --> 26:00.674
Did you send dead fish to Mom?

26:00.676 --> 26:02.884
What on earth are you
going on about now?

26:02.886 --> 26:04.478
Mom's back at the Pembrooke

26:04.480 --> 26:07.597
hysterical because someone wants
her sleeping with the fishes.

26:09.360 --> 26:11.768
I can't believe we're still
having this conversation.

26:11.770 --> 26:13.429
But here we go again.

26:13.431 --> 26:16.323
I had nothing to do with
whatever happened to your mother.

26:16.325 --> 26:18.158
Well, then it was one
of your associates.

26:18.160 --> 26:19.993
Or enemies.

26:19.995 --> 26:21.587
Are you sure it wasn't just a prank?

26:21.589 --> 26:23.923
It was a lot more than a prank.

26:23.925 --> 26:26.478
It was a not-so-veiled
threat to her life.

26:26.481 --> 26:29.046
Daddy, you have to protect her.

26:31.956 --> 26:33.414
What would you like me to do?

26:33.417 --> 26:34.624
Don't get a divorce.

26:35.961 --> 26:37.727
Okay. Barring that,

26:37.729 --> 26:41.223
don't shun her in public so the
whole world sees that she's alone,

26:41.225 --> 26:44.642
left twisting in the wind
by her all-powerful husband.

26:47.806 --> 26:49.598
I think I can get to the tapes

26:49.600 --> 26:51.520
Edgar has on my mom and Polly.

26:52.519 --> 26:54.412
On a scale of one to ten,

26:55.865 --> 26:59.283
how dangerous is you sneaking
into the Farm gonna be?

26:59.285 --> 27:02.018
Well, they're still having
the open house, so...

27:02.667 --> 27:04.092
not as dangerous

27:04.095 --> 27:07.546
as you and Archie raiding a
building full of Gargoyles.

27:07.549 --> 27:09.859
This is the best pillow talk ever.

27:15.416 --> 27:19.001
Today not only marks the opening
of the Lodge Detention Center,

27:19.004 --> 27:22.139
it also represents a
milestone for our town.

27:22.141 --> 27:24.725
This building is our promise to you

27:24.727 --> 27:26.134
for a safer future.

27:26.136 --> 27:30.054
Today, we put our
beloved families first.

27:30.057 --> 27:31.389
And on that note,

27:31.391 --> 27:33.099
I wouldn't be here today

27:33.101 --> 27:36.737
if not for the love and
support of my daughter Veronica

27:36.739 --> 27:39.999
and that of my wife,
Hermione, the love of my life,

27:40.001 --> 27:42.317
or as most of you
call her, Madame Mayor.

27:50.252 --> 27:51.677
All right, listen up.

27:51.679 --> 27:52.937
This is it.

27:54.347 --> 27:56.848
Thanks to Mad Dog's recon,
we have a pretty decent idea

27:56.851 --> 27:58.500
of the layout of the apartment building.

27:58.502 --> 28:00.501
But we still need to
be vigilant in there.

30:14.638 --> 30:16.063
You're good, Jug?

30:16.065 --> 30:18.231
Yeah. Thanks.

30:18.233 --> 30:20.033
Good job.

30:20.686 --> 30:22.018
I'll take care of them.

30:22.020 --> 30:23.570
Go find that scumbag cook.

30:46.595 --> 30:48.060
You gotta be kidding me.

31:19.202 --> 31:20.961
Grab his hands.

31:26.794 --> 31:27.958
Let's go.

31:32.716 --> 31:33.732
You go.

31:33.734 --> 31:35.425
I got Kurtz.

31:45.589 --> 31:46.787
Hey, Jughead.

31:49.065 --> 31:50.372
I'm ready to ascend.

31:51.493 --> 31:52.734
Are you?

32:05.007 --> 32:06.173
Jug...

32:06.175 --> 32:07.485
Don't let Kurtz get away!

32:23.298 --> 32:26.434
- Always good to see you, Hiram.
- Ah, thank you, Monsignor.

32:26.436 --> 32:27.828
Monsignor Montgomery.

32:34.945 --> 32:36.795
What was the Monsignor doing here?

32:36.797 --> 32:38.717
Delivering the news in person.

32:42.118 --> 32:44.044
That our marriage has been annulled.

32:44.046 --> 32:45.868
- What?
- You should be happy.

32:45.871 --> 32:48.215
It's much less public than a divorce.

32:48.217 --> 32:52.001
And so far as our
community is concerned,

32:52.003 --> 32:54.229
your mother remains under my protection.

32:54.231 --> 32:57.149
But in the eyes of God and the church,

32:57.152 --> 32:59.485
it's as if our marriage never existed.

32:59.487 --> 33:02.053
That's not what I wanted.

33:02.055 --> 33:04.055
Clearly not.

33:04.057 --> 33:06.066
Since you did send your
mother those dead fish.

33:06.068 --> 33:07.509
What are you talking about?

33:07.511 --> 33:09.853
You know, it took me a
while to figure this one out.

33:09.855 --> 33:12.989
It was one of your
more creative tactics.

33:12.991 --> 33:15.149
Threaten your mother's life,

33:15.151 --> 33:17.031
so that I had to protect her.

33:18.413 --> 33:20.333
That is what happened, isn't it?

33:23.493 --> 33:26.011
I thought if I could get you two

33:26.013 --> 33:28.305
together in public

33:29.683 --> 33:31.058
you'd have to pretend.

33:32.710 --> 33:34.685
And...

33:34.688 --> 33:36.855
if you pretended long enough,

33:39.718 --> 33:41.838
you'd start to feel
the real thing again.

33:44.055 --> 33:45.855
But it's over.

33:45.858 --> 33:47.454
Isn't it?

33:47.457 --> 33:50.684
No matter what I do,

33:50.687 --> 33:52.312
it's over.

33:52.315 --> 33:53.564
Yeah.

33:55.284 --> 33:56.708
It's over, mija.

34:18.431 --> 34:20.232
You've got guns now?

34:20.234 --> 34:22.216
I just led my Serpents into a buzzsaw.

34:22.217 --> 34:23.967
It's a miracle that
none of us were killed.

34:23.969 --> 34:26.146
You wouldn't be dodging stray bullets

34:26.148 --> 34:28.764
if you kept your nose
out of my business.

34:28.766 --> 34:31.650
I told you to stay out of it.

34:31.652 --> 34:34.896
I think it's time that you,
Dad and I have a big talk

34:34.898 --> 34:36.322
Put all the cards on the table.

34:36.324 --> 34:38.699
I don't care if his heart breaks.

34:38.702 --> 34:40.755
He needs to know exactly
what you're doing.

34:40.757 --> 34:42.829
No, he doesn't.

34:42.831 --> 34:45.367
He and Jellybean aren't a part of this.

34:46.909 --> 34:49.001
This is between you and me, kiddo.

34:49.004 --> 34:50.429
Mano a mano.

34:54.851 --> 34:56.811
You caught us by surprise tonight.

34:58.012 --> 34:59.670
That won't happen again.

34:59.673 --> 35:01.014
Slowly but surely,

35:01.017 --> 35:03.897
I'm going to choke your
whole operation to death.

35:24.131 --> 35:26.280
Brothers and sisters.

35:26.282 --> 35:27.424
Good evening.

35:29.390 --> 35:33.597
It warms my heart to see so many
new faces with us here tonight,

35:35.142 --> 35:38.852
including our newest
initiate, Cheryl Blossom.

35:39.854 --> 35:41.312
Welcome to our community, Cheryl.

35:41.315 --> 35:43.649
Damn it, Cheryl. Why? Why?

35:43.651 --> 35:45.249
May the one become many,

35:45.252 --> 35:47.152
- and the many one.
- And the many one.

35:47.154 --> 35:49.470
It's an alphanumeric system.

35:49.472 --> 35:51.048
Brothers and sisters,

35:51.050 --> 35:54.067
you've all come here
tonight under great scrutiny

35:54.069 --> 35:57.779
and judgment from your
friends and neighbors,

35:57.781 --> 36:00.648
and possibly even your own family.

36:00.650 --> 36:05.528
But only through great sacrifice
will your lives be full.

36:05.530 --> 36:07.397
Cooper. Cooper.

36:07.399 --> 36:10.479
The greater the sacrifice,
the greater the bounty.

36:11.345 --> 36:12.636
Plant your seed.

36:13.514 --> 36:15.430
Brothers and sisters,

36:15.432 --> 36:17.206
plant it in the earth...

36:17.208 --> 36:19.500
Two down, one to go.

36:19.502 --> 36:20.978
...and watch it grow.

36:22.672 --> 36:24.064
Spread it to others.

36:31.347 --> 36:32.656
Hey, Mad Dog.

36:32.658 --> 36:34.038
Any sign of Baby Teeth?

36:34.041 --> 36:35.391
No one's seen him since the raid.

36:35.393 --> 36:36.868
Not yet.

36:36.870 --> 36:38.950
Some of the guys are
out looking for him.

36:39.731 --> 36:42.213
- How's your family?
- Oh, they're good.

36:42.216 --> 36:44.710
They'll be even better when I
get them out of that building.

36:44.712 --> 36:46.211
Where to? You got a place?

36:46.213 --> 36:47.363
I do.

36:48.698 --> 36:50.979
Elio hooked me up with
a house on the Northside.

36:51.719 --> 36:52.884
Elio did?

36:55.222 --> 36:56.837
So, what? You have to fight for him?

36:56.840 --> 36:58.724
Come on, man. You saw that place.

36:58.726 --> 37:00.370
That's not where I
want my grandma living,

37:00.373 --> 37:01.730
my little brother growing up.

37:01.733 --> 37:05.046
I hear that, Mad Dog,
but you can't trust Elio.

37:05.049 --> 37:07.844
Of all the options before me,

37:07.847 --> 37:09.359
his is the best.

37:11.179 --> 37:13.572
I wouldn't even be here
if it wasn't for you, Red.

37:15.734 --> 37:16.908
I'll never forget that.

37:38.081 --> 37:39.622
What's this?

37:39.624 --> 37:42.734
The tapes of your recorded
session with Edgar.

37:42.737 --> 37:45.178
They have nothing on you now.
You don't have to go back.

37:45.180 --> 37:47.013
But, Betty, I want to.

37:47.015 --> 37:48.631
- I'm going to.
- Why?

37:48.633 --> 37:50.967
You don't listen to anyone, Cheryl,

37:50.969 --> 37:52.385
why Edgar Evernever?

37:52.387 --> 37:56.465
It's not about Edgar,
Betty. It's about Jason.

37:59.477 --> 38:00.809
They let me see him.

38:03.957 --> 38:06.533
Edgar took me to a room,

38:06.535 --> 38:08.293
closed the door and...

38:09.320 --> 38:12.887
inside there was Jason,

38:14.159 --> 38:15.283
my dearest brother.

38:15.285 --> 38:16.802
Um, I don't understand.

38:16.804 --> 38:19.074
You heard his voice?

38:19.077 --> 38:20.972
- Like a séance?
- No.

38:21.642 --> 38:23.433
It was Jason.

38:23.435 --> 38:26.478
I know it sounds crazy, but I saw him,

38:26.480 --> 38:28.800
talked to him in the flesh.

38:30.130 --> 38:31.924
I thought I would never see him again,

38:31.926 --> 38:34.069
but the Farm gave me back my brother.

38:42.979 --> 38:46.939
Thanks for meeting me here, Mom.

38:46.941 --> 38:51.201
I had something that I
wanted to ask you in person.

38:51.204 --> 38:52.504
What, honey?

38:54.416 --> 38:59.827
Is the reason you're so
obsessed with the Farm

38:59.830 --> 39:02.185
because they let you talk to Charles?

39:08.355 --> 39:09.771
Yeah.

39:12.884 --> 39:14.550
Yes. I see my son.

39:14.552 --> 39:16.931
And it's like I never lost him.

39:18.055 --> 39:19.346
Oh, you...

39:19.349 --> 39:21.608
You would love your brother, Elizabeth.

39:21.610 --> 39:24.911
He's the most beautiful
boy I have ever seen.

39:25.739 --> 39:27.113
Being with him

39:27.115 --> 39:29.849
is unlike anything I can ever imagine.

39:31.953 --> 39:33.873
And it's all because of Edgar.

39:37.260 --> 39:39.558
Edgar brought me my son.

39:39.561 --> 39:40.802
Mom...

39:42.914 --> 39:44.247
can I meet him?

39:44.249 --> 39:45.640
Charles?

39:45.642 --> 39:46.892
Edgar.

39:57.220 --> 39:59.446
Hmm. Well...

40:01.149 --> 40:03.408
I was wondering when we'd finally meet.

40:03.410 --> 40:06.492
Me too, Mr. Evernever.

40:08.398 --> 40:09.623
You've been busy.

40:11.752 --> 40:14.753
You know, Betty,

40:14.755 --> 40:16.922
I could always ask your mother

40:16.924 --> 40:20.425
and sister to give
their testimony again.

40:20.427 --> 40:23.587
And who's to say I don't have
copies of those tapes in storage?

40:24.839 --> 40:25.889
Off-site?

40:28.376 --> 40:30.251
There.

40:30.253 --> 40:32.277
So, please,

40:32.280 --> 40:33.647
tell me.

40:35.350 --> 40:37.150
What do you want to know?

40:40.430 --> 40:41.673
Everything.

40:45.026 --> 40:46.701
Start from the beginning.

40:49.427 --> 40:50.622
Archie.

40:51.833 --> 40:53.083
Found this outside.

40:57.113 --> 40:58.612
Is there Fresh-Aid in this?

40:58.614 --> 41:00.840
No, but there's a Quest Card.

41:03.042 --> 41:04.600
"Defang the wolf cub."

41:07.749 --> 41:09.140
Looks like a tooth.

41:12.887 --> 41:14.707
Jug...

41:14.710 --> 41:16.189
Baby Teeth.

41:17.675 --> 41:20.343
Or what's left of him.

41:20.345 --> 41:23.694
Terry, I'm getting close
to the clearing that the...

41:23.697 --> 41:25.073
the hiker called about.

41:27.685 --> 41:28.994
But I don't see any...
