WEBVTT

00:02.872 --> 00:04.439
- It's not fair.

00:04.482 --> 00:06.006
How you see me.

00:06.049 --> 00:08.182
- The committee agreed
that I won't

00:08.225 --> 00:10.358
be working hands-on
with patients.

00:10.401 --> 00:12.142
- I didn't know--
- No, you don't know!

00:12.186 --> 00:13.491
You know nothing!

00:13.535 --> 00:15.189
- About my dad.

00:15.232 --> 00:20.150
I'm not up to date on his
condition because we don't talk.

00:20.716 --> 00:23.545
[Bashir]: I wish we got to stay
where we were.

00:24.154 --> 00:26.156
Live our lives from then.

00:29.942 --> 00:32.597
Nah, you serve coffee
all day.

00:38.473 --> 00:39.952
- Amateur.

00:39.996 --> 00:41.563
[chuckles]

00:45.480 --> 00:46.829
- Soy butter?

00:46.872 --> 00:49.527
Amira seems really intent on
giving up meat, huh?

00:49.571 --> 00:51.355
[in Arabic]:

00:58.101 --> 01:00.234
- Are these pads?

01:01.583 --> 01:02.627
[in Arabic]:

01:08.416 --> 01:10.070
- What?

01:10.113 --> 01:11.245
- Nothing.

01:11.288 --> 01:13.595
- You don't trust me
to handle it?

01:13.638 --> 01:16.119
- No, I'm glad that you were
there for her, I just thought

01:16.163 --> 01:17.599
you would have told me.

01:18.948 --> 01:20.645
[in Arabic]:

01:32.092 --> 01:33.267
- Rania.

01:35.573 --> 01:38.272
- Ah, there's my bag.
- Lunch is packed.

01:38.315 --> 01:40.187
- I'll walk you to school.

01:49.631 --> 01:51.589
[gentle music]

01:53.591 --> 01:55.637
[city hubbub]

01:56.290 --> 01:59.293
[indistinct chatter on PA]

02:00.207 --> 02:02.078
- Have you seen Dr. Hunter?

02:02.122 --> 02:04.646
- Not since you asked me
five minutes ago.

02:07.083 --> 02:09.477
- Hi, uh...

02:09.520 --> 02:13.045
I'm just transcribing here,
but do you know why Dr. Hunter

02:13.089 --> 02:15.570
keeps saying to ad lib?

02:17.833 --> 02:19.617
- At liberty.

02:19.661 --> 02:23.143
As in, I'm at liberty
to remind you they teach
that in first year.

02:23.186 --> 02:25.841
[laughs]

02:36.547 --> 02:38.288
Are you hiding from
your student?

02:38.332 --> 02:41.335
- I forgot how much work it was
managing people.

02:41.378 --> 02:42.727
[scoffs]
- Preach.

02:42.771 --> 02:44.164
- Juney!

02:46.209 --> 02:47.602
- Oh, hi, Charles.

02:47.645 --> 02:49.169
I thought I said I would
call you.

02:49.212 --> 02:51.083
- Yeah, and you didn't, but
we need to talk.

02:51.127 --> 02:53.651
- Okay, so this is Mags
and Theo.

02:53.999 --> 02:55.392
[chuckles]

02:55.436 --> 02:57.525
- Well, that was half
an introduction.

02:57.568 --> 02:59.483
Good to meet you guys,
I'm Charles,

02:59.527 --> 03:01.746
June's little brother.
- Mags, June!

03:01.790 --> 03:03.008
GSW coming in!

03:03.052 --> 03:04.793
- Sorry, gotta go.
- Uh--

03:05.794 --> 03:08.013
- You think I should start
calling her Juney?

03:08.057 --> 03:11.278
- Oh. Well, that depends,

03:11.321 --> 03:13.541
do you consider yourself
a smart man, Theo?

03:13.584 --> 03:15.151
[laughing]

03:15.195 --> 03:16.631
[siren]

03:17.588 --> 03:19.851
- Dylan Carter, 19, gunned down
while filling up his car!

03:19.895 --> 03:21.549
Counted two entries,
but there could be more!

03:21.592 --> 03:23.551
Wrapped what we could,
gave him saline and morphine.

03:23.594 --> 03:25.335
- Hang on, Dylan.
You're in a hospital.

03:25.379 --> 03:27.729
We're going to help you.
- This kid's only 20?

03:27.772 --> 03:30.253
- Activate MTP, I need two
large bore IVs,

03:30.297 --> 03:32.777
two litres of saline and
one gram of TXA!

03:34.431 --> 03:36.868
- He's got a right-sided
pneumothorax,

03:36.912 --> 03:39.219
I don't see any fluid
in the belly on the eFAST.

03:39.262 --> 03:40.394
- Where does it hurt most,
Dylan?

03:40.437 --> 03:42.526
- My chest.
- Okay, I have, uh...

03:42.570 --> 03:45.225
one entry in the right side of
his chest and another

03:45.268 --> 03:46.878
in the abdomen,
right lower quadrant.

03:46.922 --> 03:49.490
- One more in his thigh!
- His head wound is superficial!

03:49.533 --> 03:51.318
- Dylan, can you feel
your arms or legs?

03:51.361 --> 03:52.580
- I didn't see who shot.

03:52.623 --> 03:55.409
- Okay, log roll,
check for exits! Quickly!

03:56.061 --> 03:57.628
Okay, one, two, three.

03:57.672 --> 03:59.717
[groaning]

03:59.761 --> 04:01.458
Okay, three entries,

04:01.502 --> 04:04.244
I have an exit on his chest
and abdomen.

04:04.287 --> 04:06.028
- Nothing on the leg,
bullet rule's uneven.

04:06.071 --> 04:07.551
- One, two, three.

04:10.337 --> 04:11.947
- Someone call my gran?

04:11.990 --> 04:14.558
[machine beeping rapidly]

04:14.602 --> 04:16.733
- Is he gonna make it?
- Dylan?

04:17.082 --> 04:18.867
LOC is decreasing!

04:18.910 --> 04:20.999
- Let's shoot a chest
and pelvis to look for fragments
or bullets.

04:21.043 --> 04:23.088
- Before you move him,
I'll need a blood sample.

04:23.132 --> 04:24.568
This kid's no victim.

04:24.612 --> 04:26.483
I need a DNA sample before
anything else.

04:26.527 --> 04:29.530
- Officer, we don't have
time for that and you don't
have consent. Out!

04:29.573 --> 04:31.009
- He's crashing!
- You heard him.

04:31.053 --> 04:34.099
- Start oxygen, push fluids and
more blood products.

04:34.143 --> 04:35.405
Let's give him a chance.

04:35.449 --> 04:37.146
- Colton Parker,
seven years old.

04:37.189 --> 04:39.714
Heart rate is 150,
BP is 80 over 50,

04:39.757 --> 04:41.585
bradypneic breathing at
every 10 minutes.

04:41.629 --> 04:43.152
He ate the parents' edibles.

04:43.195 --> 04:44.458
- They're Heather's edibles,
not mine.

04:44.501 --> 04:46.198
- You mean cannabis?
- I keep them locked up!

04:46.242 --> 04:49.289
I only use them to fall asleep.
I don't know how he found them!

04:49.332 --> 04:51.203
- How much did he ingest?
- I don't know!

04:51.247 --> 04:53.162
I brought the empty package
with me, but don't remember

04:53.205 --> 04:55.773
how many were in there. He
must've thought they were candy.

04:55.817 --> 04:58.254
- What's important right now
is that we get Colton breathing.

04:58.298 --> 05:01.431
Once we have him stabilized,
we can assess the toxicity
in his system, okay?

05:01.475 --> 05:02.780
We'll update you when
we know more.

05:02.824 --> 05:05.130
- Dylan's BP isn't moving.
80 over 60.

05:05.174 --> 05:06.958
- Let's run it down in order.

05:07.002 --> 05:09.134
- Head wound seems minor,
we'll CT to be sure.

05:09.178 --> 05:12.268
- The bullet wound to the chest
has caused an extremely large
pneumothorax.

05:12.312 --> 05:15.140
X-rays are showing a distance
of more than three centimeters
to the apex.

05:15.184 --> 05:18.143
He's got persistent hypotension,
and his shock index is 1,6.

05:18.187 --> 05:21.451
- Abdo's positive now,
significant internal bleeding.

05:21.495 --> 05:23.975
He needs the OR
or an emergency laparotomy.

05:24.019 --> 05:26.369
- And the bullet he kept?
- Trauma film shows

05:26.413 --> 05:28.415
it's subcutaneous on
the posterior left thigh.

05:28.458 --> 05:29.807
- Where it's clear of
his femoral.

05:29.851 --> 05:32.288
- But still remains a risk until
we know how close.

05:32.332 --> 05:34.116
One wrong shift could kill him.

05:34.159 --> 05:36.771
- Choices made now dictate
his options in the future.

05:36.814 --> 05:39.600
- I've seen a pneumothorax
this large before.

05:39.643 --> 05:41.993
He needs a VATS to make sure
his lung doesn't recollapse.

05:42.037 --> 05:44.692
- No, the pneumo should be
drained now to stabilize him,

05:44.735 --> 05:46.737
then thoracics can do a VATS.
He needs the OR

05:46.781 --> 05:49.087
for uncontrolled bleeding
and we can get him there safely

05:49.131 --> 05:51.655
if we decompress his lung.
- I think you're wrong.

05:51.699 --> 05:53.875
- It's Dr. Hamed's patient
so it's his call.

05:55.703 --> 05:57.052
- And her?

05:59.533 --> 06:02.449
- Chest tube first,
then you and I will talk to her.

06:04.799 --> 06:06.714
[gentle music]

06:20.815 --> 06:22.686
- His O2 SATS aren't climbing.

06:22.730 --> 06:24.732
- We need to intubate now.
Laryngoscope.

06:25.907 --> 06:27.735
Move, Jake.

06:30.215 --> 06:33.349
Did you do any that reading
I gave you on difficult airway
intubation?

06:33.393 --> 06:35.438
- Yeah.
- Good. Next steps?

06:35.482 --> 06:38.354
- Uh, lift the epiglottis?
- Stabilize the larynx.

06:38.398 --> 06:40.617
I can't get a good visual.

06:40.661 --> 06:43.054
- His neck's stiff as a board,
paralytic wore off?

06:43.098 --> 06:44.621
- Could be an atypical seizure.

06:44.665 --> 06:47.624
Stiffening of the muscles can
happen with THC ingestion.

06:48.103 --> 06:50.410
I can't risk going in there
without damaging his airway.

06:50.453 --> 06:52.107
Damn it! Bag.

06:53.151 --> 06:56.111
If his neck's too rigid, we need
to make the tube more flexible.

06:56.764 --> 06:58.896
We need a gum bougie and
more paralytic agent.

06:58.940 --> 06:59.941
Give him 30 of succs.

06:59.984 --> 07:01.246
- Doesn't that mean going
in blind?

07:01.290 --> 07:03.423
- A messy solution's better
than no solution.

07:04.554 --> 07:06.556
That's too big
for a pedes patient.

07:06.600 --> 07:09.211
Urinary catheter with
a coude tip.

07:09.254 --> 07:10.821
- Urinary for intubation?

07:10.865 --> 07:12.867
- It's more flexible
for smaller windpipes.

07:12.910 --> 07:15.435
- Just stand back and watch,
Jake.

07:17.306 --> 07:18.960
Take over.

07:22.137 --> 07:24.008
Off the bag.

07:25.314 --> 07:27.490
I'm past the epiglottis.

07:27.534 --> 07:29.231
And then, past the larynx.

07:29.274 --> 07:30.711
Grab the tube, Claire.

07:30.754 --> 07:33.104
Slide it over the proximal tip.

07:33.148 --> 07:34.541
Good.

07:34.584 --> 07:38.762
Good, almost there, hand back
control and we just...

07:38.806 --> 07:41.156
- Rotate anti-clockwise
and re-route?

07:41.199 --> 07:42.810
- You got it.

07:43.332 --> 07:45.726
Okay. We're in.

07:45.769 --> 07:47.728
Inflating the balloon.

07:52.123 --> 07:54.604
SATS are climbing.

07:59.827 --> 08:01.829
He needs an OG tube
and activated charcoal.

08:01.872 --> 08:04.527
No way to know the damage until
we run more tests.

08:04.571 --> 08:05.659
- And the parents?

08:05.702 --> 08:07.965
- I'll loop in a social worker.

08:13.580 --> 08:15.364
- Hey, did I see Mr. Willis
is back?

08:15.407 --> 08:17.018
- Yeah. Right. He is.

08:17.061 --> 08:19.324
- Patellar instability after
tripping over his sleeping cat

08:19.368 --> 08:20.891
sent him down the stairs
three weeks ago.

08:20.935 --> 08:23.503
Page ortho, he might be
a candidate for trochleoplasty.

08:23.546 --> 08:25.374
- You keep all that at the top
of your brain?

08:25.417 --> 08:27.594
- Still can't find Dr. Hunter?
- No.

08:27.637 --> 08:29.857
He wants me to redo
some reading.

08:29.900 --> 08:31.989
So I don't think
I'm impressing him much.

08:32.033 --> 08:35.035
- Well, then maybe you
need to find a way to be
more impressive.

08:36.385 --> 08:38.996
- Okay, wait, hold up.
Hold up, hold up.

08:39.039 --> 08:41.520
- I can't.
- You're the tough love type.

08:41.563 --> 08:43.523
I appreciate that.

08:43.566 --> 08:46.134
How do I do that?

08:46.177 --> 08:48.528
- Well, for starters,
if Dr. Hunter doesn't need you,

08:48.571 --> 08:53.141
find someone who does. Use this
place to, you know, expand.

08:53.184 --> 08:55.099
Practice running
every differential you can.

08:55.143 --> 08:56.623
No one's gonna open doors
for you, Jake,

08:56.666 --> 08:58.450
so don't be afraid
to open them yourself.

08:58.494 --> 09:00.540
Did you--
[woman whimpering]

09:01.758 --> 09:04.108
- I'll consider that.
- Is everything okay?

09:04.761 --> 09:07.329
- Sorry. This room was empty.
- No, it's fine.

09:07.372 --> 09:09.766
Sit down.
Did you burn yourself?

09:09.810 --> 09:12.203
- Just had a minor fight with
the pressure washer.

09:12.247 --> 09:15.511
- Hmm, well, steam burns
even hotter than boiling water.

09:15.555 --> 09:17.034
And, perfect place to get it
looked at.

09:17.078 --> 09:18.688
- I still have four floors
to do.

09:18.732 --> 09:20.516
- Oh no, trust me, people
come in for way less.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.213
And you don't want to mess
with a burn.

09:22.257 --> 09:24.085
I'll be quick, I promise.

09:26.435 --> 09:28.219
- Dylan Carter's in surgery now.

09:28.263 --> 09:29.830
- Does that mean he'll survive?

09:29.873 --> 09:32.180
- Depends how he responds,
but we hope so.

09:32.223 --> 09:34.878
- You do realize
this is gangland retribution.

09:34.922 --> 09:37.577
There are two actually innocent
bystanders at St. Luke's

09:37.620 --> 09:41.232
because of the choices
the suspect you're protecting
made in life.

09:41.276 --> 09:42.799
- We're treating a patient.

09:42.843 --> 09:44.888
How he got shot has nothing
to do with our duty of care.

09:44.932 --> 09:46.542
- Dylan's known associates
are responsible

09:46.586 --> 09:49.414
for a house party shooting where
three people died last month.

09:49.458 --> 09:52.853
Witnesses put him there too,
but his DNA could tie him to it.

09:52.896 --> 09:55.507
- Is he under arrest?
- No, he's not.

09:55.551 --> 09:57.422
- We have our protocol,
you have yours.

09:57.466 --> 10:00.948
You want his blood, show us
you have a legal right to it.

10:02.079 --> 10:03.777
Kid requires multiple
surgeries.

10:03.820 --> 10:05.430
He's not going anywhere.

10:05.474 --> 10:08.651
- Meanwhile, my father's waiting
a year for a hip replacement.

10:08.695 --> 10:11.219
I'll be back with a warrant.

10:14.831 --> 10:16.920
- Thanks for backing me up.

10:16.964 --> 10:19.619
- Patients first, Dr. Hamed.

10:27.539 --> 10:29.193
- You're not even gonna sit?

10:29.629 --> 10:31.152
I've been here 10 days

10:31.195 --> 10:33.371
and you already managed
to break two dinner dates

10:33.415 --> 10:34.634
and not call me once.

10:34.677 --> 10:36.157
- I've just been busy, with
the new role.

10:36.200 --> 10:38.942
- And I'm working remotely
from a city I don't live in,

10:38.986 --> 10:41.641
taking care of an increasingly
cranky father,

10:41.684 --> 10:44.252
being an absent husband...

10:44.295 --> 10:46.123
Oh, and the Facetime parent to
the nephew you never see.

10:46.167 --> 10:49.300
- Okay.
- And yet I'm still making time
to come visit you.

10:49.344 --> 10:51.302
- Easy on the guilt trip, right.

10:51.346 --> 10:54.697
Besides, it's not like
you're here to see me,

10:54.741 --> 10:57.091
you're here to ask me about Dad.

10:57.134 --> 11:00.050
- There's supposed to be perks
to having a doctor for a sister?

11:02.096 --> 11:03.575
His, um...

11:04.228 --> 11:06.666
his treatment's getting
complicated.

11:06.709 --> 11:08.276
- That's why I hired him
a nurse.

11:08.319 --> 11:11.322
- Who he promptly pissed off
and now refuses to come back.

11:11.366 --> 11:14.195
I thought about giving
her mom's number so they could
compare complaints.

11:14.238 --> 11:17.677
- Sounds like a you problem.
- I'm flying blind here.

11:18.721 --> 11:21.332
This is me asking, not Dad.

11:22.725 --> 11:24.205
[sighing]
- I've already told you,

11:24.248 --> 11:25.772
I don't want anything
to do with him.

11:25.815 --> 11:27.382
- He's dying, Juney.

11:31.212 --> 11:33.127
You didn't know.

11:34.345 --> 11:35.695
[soft music]

11:36.217 --> 11:41.309
They say six months barring
some kind of miracle.

11:41.352 --> 11:42.745
[pager beeping]

11:42.789 --> 11:45.705
- I just-- I don't...

11:45.748 --> 11:48.229
I don't know
what it changes, so...

11:48.272 --> 11:49.752
- That's cold.

11:49.796 --> 11:51.711
Even for you.

11:52.146 --> 11:54.888
- I have patients
I have to go see.

11:58.369 --> 12:01.285
- I've put a little extra milk
in there for you.

12:01.329 --> 12:03.853
Working doctors
tend to brew it strong.

12:03.897 --> 12:06.943
- Shockingly, I have missed
our monthly check-ins.

12:06.987 --> 12:09.119
- Well, we are heavy on
bed occupancy,

12:09.163 --> 12:11.121
but we've been turning
them around fast.

12:11.165 --> 12:13.820
We've been running effective
simulations on...

12:13.863 --> 12:15.517
trauma protocols.

12:15.560 --> 12:17.214
- I've been reading the reports.

12:17.998 --> 12:20.217
- Everything upstairs okay?
- The usual.

12:20.261 --> 12:22.959
Plenty of ideas,
very little money.

12:25.832 --> 12:28.486
- Should I keep making
small talk, Joan?

12:28.530 --> 12:31.838
Because it's like I tell
my residents, time is function.

12:33.230 --> 12:36.364
- Take this in before
you react, Jed.

12:37.669 --> 12:40.716
The board wants you to start
thinking about who should lead,

12:40.760 --> 12:42.500
once you step down.

12:43.327 --> 12:46.287
You've built this department
from the ground up.

12:46.330 --> 12:49.594
It's a reflection of you
and you should be proud of that.

12:49.638 --> 12:52.859
But the last thing we want
is for that growth to stagnate.

12:52.902 --> 12:54.861
We need to stay ahead
of the curve.

12:54.904 --> 12:58.081
- We've been functioning
perfectly in the three weeks
I've been back.

12:58.125 --> 12:59.909
- This is not about performance.

12:59.953 --> 13:02.042
But at the same time.

13:02.085 --> 13:05.262
You've had two major
health incidents in one year.

13:06.133 --> 13:08.309
- How long have you known
this was coming?

13:09.832 --> 13:11.616
Why did you even bring me back?

13:11.660 --> 13:14.228
- The best way to protect
what you created

13:14.271 --> 13:17.622
is for you to a part
of the transition process.

13:17.666 --> 13:19.233
- By choosing my own
replacement?

13:19.276 --> 13:21.888
- By choosing your own eventual
successor.

13:21.931 --> 13:24.804
And by shaping the future
of this department.

13:25.848 --> 13:29.286
- If this is really about
preserving institutional
knowledge,

13:29.330 --> 13:32.768
there are less drastic ways
to go about it.

13:32.812 --> 13:35.292
- Why don't you take some time
to get your head around this,

13:35.336 --> 13:40.123
but we'd like to have
a name to float when the board
meets next quarter.

13:54.355 --> 13:56.183
- How long was your hand
in the steam?

13:56.226 --> 13:57.662
- Not even sure.

13:57.706 --> 13:59.751
I guess it took a second
to register.

13:59.795 --> 14:02.624
I'm always telling
the new people to double-check
the valves,

14:02.667 --> 14:04.800
but you know, do as I say
and all that.

14:04.844 --> 14:06.802
- How long have you been
working here?

14:06.846 --> 14:10.284
- I took this job
after my divorce because
I needed the money.

14:10.327 --> 14:13.722
Somehow that was 10 years ago.

14:14.897 --> 14:17.508
- You're gonna want to notify
your health and safety rep

14:17.552 --> 14:19.119
and fill out an incident report.

14:19.162 --> 14:21.425
- Is that necessary?

14:21.469 --> 14:24.124
- It's standard protocol
for workplace injuries.

14:24.167 --> 14:26.430
They'll want to fix the pressure
washer so no one else

14:26.474 --> 14:28.084
gets hurt the same way.

14:32.219 --> 14:35.309
Veronica, is someone going to
give you a hard time about this?

14:35.352 --> 14:37.833
- I've seen people
get edged out for less.

14:37.877 --> 14:41.445
- But it's not your fault
if a piece of equipment
threw a tantrum.

14:42.620 --> 14:46.363
If you need backup,
they can come see me, okay?

14:46.886 --> 14:50.019
You're all done.
And don't be invisible.

14:50.063 --> 14:52.892
If you need something stronger
for the pain, you let me know.

14:55.938 --> 14:57.679
- His lung collapsed twice
during his lap

14:57.722 --> 14:59.550
and I just had to eat it
from thoracics

14:59.594 --> 15:02.249
'cause they had to redo his
chest tube to correct placement.

15:02.292 --> 15:04.642
- But he pulled through.
- Barely.

15:04.686 --> 15:06.993
- If you want me to tell
the surgeons it was my call--

15:07.036 --> 15:09.952
- I don't care about that.
The kid nearly died, Bash.

15:09.996 --> 15:12.085
Now his recovery might be
twice as long.

15:12.128 --> 15:13.347
- You were there.

15:13.390 --> 15:15.044
We had two bad options.

15:15.088 --> 15:18.004
Punishing me for picking
the wrong one won't help Dylan.

15:21.050 --> 15:23.096
- That's not what I'm doing.

15:35.543 --> 15:38.198
- His health card is in here
somewhere.

15:38.241 --> 15:42.332
- You can just give it
to the triage nurse, Ms. Carter.

15:42.376 --> 15:44.030
- Rita.

15:44.073 --> 15:46.075
[sighing]
Found it.

15:46.119 --> 15:48.773
I think it's expired though,
does that matter?

15:48.817 --> 15:50.732
Got him that shirt
for Christmas.

15:50.775 --> 15:52.212
Little punk wore it once.

15:52.255 --> 15:53.561
[sighing]

15:53.604 --> 15:55.780
Four bullets
and he's still alive?

15:55.824 --> 15:59.175
- He had surgery to repair
a lacerated appendix

15:59.219 --> 16:00.960
and a collapsed lung.

16:01.003 --> 16:04.485
We need time to see how
he responds.

16:05.573 --> 16:08.880
- I haven't seen or heard from
Dylan in two months.

16:08.924 --> 16:12.101
I've seen the cops though,
they've been here too I bet?

16:12.493 --> 16:14.625
They don't care who did this
to him.

16:14.669 --> 16:18.194
One less problem for them
if he gets what's coming to him.

16:18.238 --> 16:19.500
[sighing]

16:19.543 --> 16:21.284
When can I take him home?

16:22.111 --> 16:24.766
- Rita, even if the surgery
goes well,

16:24.809 --> 16:27.638
the recovery will...
it will be involved.

16:27.682 --> 16:29.945
- I'll take care of him.
I always do.

16:31.468 --> 16:35.255
Look, he's been living with me
since he was 12.

16:35.298 --> 16:37.779
I love my grandson,
but I'm not blind.

16:37.822 --> 16:40.912
Shoplifting at 14,
carjacking at 16.

16:40.956 --> 16:43.959
Drugs, violence. I could say
he comes by it, honestly,

16:44.003 --> 16:47.615
knowing his dirtbag parents
as I unfortunately do,

16:47.658 --> 16:50.009
but he made his choices.

16:52.054 --> 16:55.927
A lot of people been by lately,
looking for Dylan.

16:56.450 --> 16:58.147
Some of them cops,

16:58.756 --> 17:00.889
some of them definitely not.

17:00.932 --> 17:03.979
He needs someone he can trust
taking care of him.

17:06.547 --> 17:09.202
- When he came in, finding you
was all he wanted.

17:09.244 --> 17:12.031
- Because it's the one thing
I could do for him,

17:12.074 --> 17:14.032
the one rule we had.

17:14.076 --> 17:16.686
No matter what,
he could always come home.

17:17.645 --> 17:20.126
You make it so he still can.

17:20.996 --> 17:24.608
- Bottom line is
Colton is extremely lucky.

17:24.652 --> 17:26.696
The charcoal's having
a neutralizing effect

17:26.741 --> 17:28.786
and we're not seeing
any signs of brain damage.

17:28.830 --> 17:31.659
- So he's going to be okay?

17:31.702 --> 17:35.358
- We need to observe him
for the next six to eight hours.

17:35.402 --> 17:37.273
And, uh...

17:37.752 --> 17:40.798
I would like to introduce you
to Iris Kowalski.

17:41.451 --> 17:43.671
She's a social worker here
at Memorial.

17:43.714 --> 17:45.934
- I knew it.
You called Children's Aid?

17:45.977 --> 17:48.763
- I just have to ask
a few questions.

17:49.416 --> 17:53.507
Has Colton ever been exposed to
your marijuana products before?

17:53.550 --> 17:56.075
- Never. I only bring them out
when he's asleep

17:56.118 --> 17:58.120
and we keep them
in the highest cabinet.

17:58.164 --> 18:01.384
- I've told Heather
it was a hazard to even keep
them in the house.

18:01.428 --> 18:04.344
- So is alcohol
or a hot stove or--

18:04.387 --> 18:07.608
- Which is why we keep
alcohol locked in the cabinet
and the stove off!

18:07.651 --> 18:08.957
You promised me
you would be more careful!

18:09.000 --> 18:11.133
- I thought I was!
- Yeah, clearly not enough!

18:11.177 --> 18:12.352
- Whoa!

18:12.830 --> 18:17.052
Look. Colton is recovering well.
Let's all just calm down.

18:19.663 --> 18:23.624
- Look, I do have
to notify CAS,

18:23.667 --> 18:26.409
but since you have no history
of endangering your son,

18:26.453 --> 18:28.759
I doubt they'll pursue
any formal action.

18:28.803 --> 18:31.501
But we will come up
with a prevention plan
before you leave

18:31.545 --> 18:33.416
to make sure this doesn't
happen again.

18:33.460 --> 18:34.591
[sighs]

18:34.635 --> 18:36.115
- Thank you.

18:36.158 --> 18:37.681
Both of you.

18:41.294 --> 18:42.991
- Well, that was intense.

18:43.034 --> 18:45.646
- I mean, yeah.
Can you blame them?

18:45.689 --> 18:47.387
- Not at all.

18:47.430 --> 18:49.084
But I was talking about you,

18:49.128 --> 18:51.173
throwing it down with
the husband.

18:51.217 --> 18:54.437
- He was out of line
with his wife. Wasn't he?

18:54.481 --> 18:56.613
- So you're a pediatrician

18:56.657 --> 18:59.399
who fixes the marriages
of strangers?

18:59.442 --> 19:01.749
Interesting cross-practice.

19:01.792 --> 19:03.229
- Was that how I came off?

19:04.360 --> 19:06.623
[stammering]

19:06.667 --> 19:09.539
I'm going through a split.

19:10.192 --> 19:13.587
- Then you have a lot to be
pissed off about.

19:13.630 --> 19:16.851
Divorce can be ugly.
- Ours isn't.

19:16.894 --> 19:19.549
I've just been trying
to keep it from bleeding over,

19:19.593 --> 19:25.294
though my student would probably
say my success has been varied.

19:26.556 --> 19:28.993
- Well, I gotta get back.

19:31.605 --> 19:33.259
Have you ever been
to Wreck Bar?

19:33.781 --> 19:36.479
- Uh, nah, I've never heard
of it.

19:36.523 --> 19:38.264
- Unsolicited advice?

19:38.307 --> 19:41.310
Blow off some steam.
Tonight if possible.

19:41.354 --> 19:43.747
I'll email you the address.

19:46.272 --> 19:50.014
- Hey, uh, she's interesting,
isn't she?

19:50.058 --> 19:51.190
Iris.

19:51.233 --> 19:54.280
- Uh, I guess, sure.

19:55.759 --> 19:58.153
[soft music]

19:59.589 --> 20:01.200
- Gown and glove reqs.

20:01.243 --> 20:03.202
We go through almost
double during flu season.

20:03.245 --> 20:04.986
I just need you to approve
next month's overages.

20:05.029 --> 20:07.293
- On my desk.
I'll deal with it later.

20:10.513 --> 20:12.428
- Come on.

20:12.472 --> 20:14.169
How does this work?

20:17.303 --> 20:20.175
- Do I need to know about this?
- Well, one of our cleaning crew

20:20.219 --> 20:22.482
burned herself on a pressure
washer. And I treated her,

20:22.525 --> 20:24.701
but I hate the idea
that they're working with
something so unsafe.

20:24.745 --> 20:26.225
- Did she report it
to her supervisor?

20:26.268 --> 20:28.923
- I advised her to,
but she's scared it'll backfire.

20:28.966 --> 20:31.055
I thought maybe I could do it
for her, keeping her name out.

20:31.099 --> 20:33.449
- So you're Health & Safety Rep
for the cleaning department now?

20:33.493 --> 20:35.886
How many other departments
do you plan on joining?

20:35.930 --> 20:37.888
- I guess that means
you don't want me taking

20:37.932 --> 20:39.629
some of Dr. Fisher's
cardiology patients?

20:39.673 --> 20:42.284
Because she assures me
that emerg would take
absolute priority

20:42.328 --> 20:45.853
and she hasn't heard back
from you on sign-off, so...

20:45.896 --> 20:48.986
- You can't solve every problem
in the building, Mags.

20:55.166 --> 20:57.081
- How are you feeling, Dylan?

20:57.604 --> 21:00.259
- They said I took four bullets?

21:00.868 --> 21:02.739
Feels more like eight.

21:06.090 --> 21:08.397
I tried to stand,
but I couldn't.

21:08.832 --> 21:10.704
- Doctors had to remove
your appendix,

21:10.747 --> 21:13.315
re-inflate your lung and
repair a tear in it.

21:13.359 --> 21:14.708
- What about my leg?

21:14.751 --> 21:16.275
- The bullet stays in for now.

21:16.318 --> 21:18.146
It's not an immediate threat
to your femoral artery,

21:18.189 --> 21:20.148
but our vascular surgeons
will need to reassess

21:20.191 --> 21:21.628
once you're feeling stronger.

21:21.671 --> 21:23.238
- And what about the police?
- Gran.

21:23.282 --> 21:25.893
- They were here,
he spoke to them.

21:28.591 --> 21:32.029
He's not gonna talk in front
of me unless you say he can.

21:33.509 --> 21:34.858
- Yeah. She's cool.

21:34.902 --> 21:36.512
What did they say?

21:36.556 --> 21:40.037
- We told them they'd need
a warrant to take a blood sample

21:40.081 --> 21:41.735
and they said they'd be
back with one.

21:41.778 --> 21:43.476
- When?

21:44.128 --> 21:47.131
- Then I need to get him
home before they get back.
Is that possible?

21:47.175 --> 21:48.742
- No. I'm not coming home
with you, Gran.

21:48.785 --> 21:50.439
- And what are you gonna do?

21:50.483 --> 21:51.832
Go to your idiot friends
for help?

21:51.875 --> 21:53.877
- The cops will just come
find me at your place.

21:53.921 --> 21:55.444
- So let them!

21:55.488 --> 22:00.188
This doctor's been telling me
all day how serious this is.

22:00.231 --> 22:02.799
You're gonna need someone
to look after you.

22:03.626 --> 22:07.848
- The people who put me here,
they're gonna try again.

22:08.414 --> 22:11.330
I don't want you getting
mixed up in that.

22:13.027 --> 22:15.116
- I can take care of myself.

22:15.159 --> 22:17.161
I can take care of
both of us.

22:17.205 --> 22:18.772
- No, you can't!

22:18.815 --> 22:20.121
Not anymore!

22:20.164 --> 22:22.732
We're way past you
helping me, Gran!

22:22.776 --> 22:25.344
What, you wanna get shot
for me?

22:26.257 --> 22:29.217
Aren't you even gonna ask
what they think I did?

22:30.087 --> 22:33.090
- If you think you can scare me
into letting go,

22:33.134 --> 22:35.484
you're dumber than I thought.

22:36.790 --> 22:39.749
Will he be ready to leave before
that cop gets back tomorrow?

22:39.793 --> 22:43.013
- Given Dylan's condition,
I'm not comfortable making
any promises.

22:43.057 --> 22:45.755
- Just get him to where you can,
leave the rest to me.

22:46.669 --> 22:50.456
And I don't want
to hear anything from you
but "yes, ma'am".

22:50.499 --> 22:52.936
- Okay, Gran.

22:54.547 --> 22:56.200
Okay.

23:15.481 --> 23:18.614
[intense music]

23:27.014 --> 23:28.624
- Hi, uh.

23:29.495 --> 23:31.192
I'm looking for Wreck Bar.

23:31.235 --> 23:32.802
- You found it.

23:38.939 --> 23:40.549
Pick your poison.

23:40.593 --> 23:43.465
- Sorry, one sec.
I think I'm in the wrong place.

23:47.208 --> 23:49.558
[glass shattering]

23:50.777 --> 23:52.735
[screaming]

23:55.042 --> 23:58.132
- 20 bucks for as much as
you can fit in the basket.

23:58.175 --> 24:00.482
- Yeah. It's not for me.

24:01.265 --> 24:02.963
- Found it!

24:03.572 --> 24:05.792
I had the form a week,
but forgot.

24:05.835 --> 24:08.447
I need to bring it back signed
to practice tomorrow.

24:10.884 --> 24:14.017
- You have a dance competition
in Peterborough?

24:14.061 --> 24:15.410
- Next month, the 15th.

24:15.454 --> 24:17.151
- Yeah, we'll all go.

24:17.194 --> 24:19.240
Family trip.

24:19.283 --> 24:21.460
Is that okay?

24:22.069 --> 24:23.766
[in Arabic]:

24:24.288 --> 24:26.856
- There's a pool at the hotel
where they're holding rooms,

24:26.900 --> 24:29.468
but they did say one room
per family.

24:29.511 --> 24:30.686
- That's no problem.

24:30.730 --> 24:33.472
- I'm sure there's a couch
there too.

24:34.081 --> 24:35.952
[in Arabic]:

24:44.178 --> 24:46.746
[sirens blaring in the distance]

24:49.183 --> 24:50.576
[groaning]

24:50.924 --> 24:52.534
- Dylan, you have to be
in bed.

24:52.578 --> 24:54.405
Okay, if you want something
just ask.

24:54.449 --> 24:56.538
- Get this tube outta me
or I'll do it myself.

24:56.582 --> 24:59.715
- Even if I thought
you were ready for that,
you still need monitoring.

24:59.759 --> 25:01.804
No Dylan, hold on.
Just stop. Just stop!

25:01.848 --> 25:03.545
- That cop could be back
any second!

25:03.589 --> 25:05.286
She said she'd have a warrant
this morning, right?

25:05.329 --> 25:07.897
- Think about how serious
this is. Okay?

25:07.941 --> 25:10.421
Your lung could collapse again,
or your wound could tear

25:10.465 --> 25:12.423
or the bullet in your leg
could be infected?

25:12.467 --> 25:14.556
At the very least
wait for Rita to come back.

25:14.600 --> 25:16.906
- No! I meant it when I said
she can't be involved!

25:16.950 --> 25:18.560
[panting]

25:18.604 --> 25:20.475
- Is running from this really
what you want?

25:20.519 --> 25:22.999
- You heard Rita, she's never
going to let me go,

25:23.043 --> 25:25.698
and I can't be the reason
something happens to her.

25:25.741 --> 25:29.266
You can try and get in my way,
man, but I'm leaving.

25:29.310 --> 25:30.920
- Just please.
No, no, no, no.

25:30.964 --> 25:32.705
Stop, stop, stop. Please.
Five minutes.

25:32.748 --> 25:34.315
Okay, just five minutes.

25:34.358 --> 25:36.491
[panting]

25:39.320 --> 25:40.713
[June]: So you think
it's a good idea

25:40.756 --> 25:42.192
to take out his chest tube?

25:42.236 --> 25:44.934
- No, but it's better
than if he leaves with it in.

25:45.500 --> 25:48.764
Okay, I checked his charts
and drainage is less than
10 cc's per hour

25:48.808 --> 25:50.897
for the last four, and
no increased work of breathing.

25:50.940 --> 25:52.986
- Yeah, okay,
but he's still recovering
from multiple surgeries.

25:53.029 --> 25:54.596
- He made it clear
he's going, June.

25:54.640 --> 25:57.033
- But what if he did what
the cops really suspect of him

25:57.077 --> 25:58.905
and he shot someone?

25:59.775 --> 26:02.125
Look, I don't know what
you're asking me to do here.

26:02.169 --> 26:04.475
I don't know if you want me
to talk you out of this

26:04.519 --> 26:06.216
or if you want me to help you.

26:06.260 --> 26:08.001
- Maybe both.

26:09.045 --> 26:11.526
It's fine, June,
I'll deal with it.

26:15.356 --> 26:16.879
- Wait, wait.

26:20.317 --> 26:23.625
- So, Wreck Bar's totally
not a bar.

26:23.669 --> 26:25.627
- I never said it was.

26:25.671 --> 26:27.368
So what'd you break?

26:27.411 --> 26:31.154
- I prefer to find
more constructive ways
to deal with things.

26:31.198 --> 26:32.808
- Admirable.

26:32.852 --> 26:35.637
I wish I was half that
restrained when I found out

26:35.681 --> 26:37.073
my wife was cheating on me.

26:37.117 --> 26:40.511
Yeah, that place saved me from
destroying my own TV

26:40.555 --> 26:42.601
multiple times over.

26:43.427 --> 26:45.255
- I will keep it
in my back pocket.

26:50.696 --> 26:52.349
- Hey!
- I don't know where Theo is

26:52.393 --> 26:53.873
if that's what you're
wondering.

26:53.916 --> 26:55.526
- He's on his way
to a staff meeting.

26:55.570 --> 26:58.138
You said that I need to figure
out myself inside this place,

26:58.181 --> 27:00.880
but I feel like that's
half the equation.

27:00.923 --> 27:03.534
You've got this bank vault
of a brain,

27:03.578 --> 27:05.449
you remember every patient
you've ever seen.

27:05.493 --> 27:07.277
How do you manage
to keep that up?

27:07.321 --> 27:09.149
Are you ever not working?

27:09.192 --> 27:11.542
- Are you running
a differential on me?

27:11.586 --> 27:13.893
- You said to go in
on everyone that I can.

27:13.936 --> 27:15.895
- This is so not what I meant.
- It's just--

27:15.938 --> 27:18.027
- Nah.
- I'm done work, I shut off.

27:18.071 --> 27:20.856
I see family, I see friends,
I play basketball.

27:20.900 --> 27:22.510
- No wonder you're behind
on your reading.

27:22.553 --> 27:25.687
- Hey, woman in five said you
saw her yesterday for a burn?

27:25.731 --> 27:27.646
- Veronica's back?

27:28.908 --> 27:30.866
- Uh, can I tag along
on this one?

27:30.910 --> 27:32.825
Just keep learning?
- Don't say anything.

27:34.261 --> 27:36.002
You're back.
Is it the pain?

27:36.045 --> 27:39.527
- No. By this morning,
it had stopped hurting.

27:39.570 --> 27:41.268
But it looks like this.

27:41.311 --> 27:43.662
- Veronica. There's no way
this is a steam burn.

27:43.705 --> 27:45.402
You have to tell me
exactly what happened.

27:45.446 --> 27:46.882
- I spilled ammonia on it.

27:46.926 --> 27:48.536
- This is a chemical burn?

27:48.579 --> 27:50.886
- We used to get
the solutions prediluted.

27:50.930 --> 27:53.236
Someone decided it would
be cheaper to order in bulk

27:53.280 --> 27:55.064
and have us mix it
ourselves.

27:55.108 --> 27:57.632
The containers are heavy
and it slipped.

27:57.676 --> 27:59.590
- Go get Claire
to help you book an OR

27:59.634 --> 28:00.896
for a possible debridement.

28:00.940 --> 28:02.419
- You think I need surgery?

28:02.463 --> 28:03.682
- When ammonia gets
in your tissue

28:03.725 --> 28:05.379
it kills the cells,
necrosis.

28:05.422 --> 28:06.859
I have to assess
how far in it went.

28:06.902 --> 28:08.861
- But I googled it
after the spill.

28:08.904 --> 28:10.601
It said to flush it,
which I did.

28:10.645 --> 28:12.603
- But chemical burns
need prolonged irrigation.

28:12.647 --> 28:14.214
Why didn't you tell me
the truth?

28:14.257 --> 28:17.086
- I didn't want my supervisor
knowing I messed up.

28:17.130 --> 28:18.740
- Can you feel this?

28:20.960 --> 28:23.702
Well, you have what's called
a full thickness burn.

28:24.137 --> 28:26.574
The ammonia got through
every layer of the tissue.

28:26.617 --> 28:29.272
A simple debridement
won't be enough.

28:29.316 --> 28:31.013
- What do you mean?

28:31.057 --> 28:33.537
- It'll be up to the surgeons,
but likely

28:33.581 --> 28:35.278
they'll try something called
an escharotomy

28:35.322 --> 28:38.281
to release the pressure and
try to save some tissue, but...

28:39.021 --> 28:42.198
There is a possibility
that they'll have to amputate.

28:43.156 --> 28:44.984
I'm sorry, Veronica.

28:45.027 --> 28:46.246
I'll be back.

28:48.291 --> 28:50.946
[dramatic music]

28:56.996 --> 28:58.824
- Warrant to take
bodily substances

28:58.867 --> 29:00.608
for forensic DNA analysis.

29:00.651 --> 29:03.132
- Where is he? Where's Dylan?
- Ms. Carter.

29:03.176 --> 29:05.439
- You said you'd help him
and you let him leave?

29:05.482 --> 29:07.093
- Wait.
Dylan Carter's gone?

29:07.136 --> 29:09.704
You told me he needed medical
assistance for days.

29:09.748 --> 29:11.750
It's been 24 hours!
How is he gone?

29:11.793 --> 29:13.534
- Oh, don't act like you care
about him!

29:13.577 --> 29:16.319
- Rita, he told us
he was leaving whether
we wanted him to or not.

29:16.363 --> 29:19.148
- It's not our job
to hold suspects for you
and you know that.

29:19.192 --> 29:22.673
- Ma'am, if you really care
about your grandson,

29:22.717 --> 29:24.284
you'll work with me
to find him.

29:24.327 --> 29:25.676
- Oh piss off!

29:25.720 --> 29:27.678
He didn't shoot anyone!

29:27.722 --> 29:29.637
You seriously think
I'd help you?

29:29.680 --> 29:32.640
You failed him.

29:32.683 --> 29:34.207
All of you!

29:35.991 --> 29:37.166
- Ma'am.

29:38.385 --> 29:40.039
- You took out his chest tube

29:40.082 --> 29:41.344
when his condition
was still acute?

29:41.388 --> 29:43.564
- We did. He said he was gonna
leave either way

29:43.607 --> 29:45.131
and it was the right
thing to do.

29:45.174 --> 29:47.873
- Sir, there wasn't enough time
to ask you.

29:47.916 --> 29:50.919
Would you not have done
the same?

29:51.920 --> 29:54.793
- Yes, but it wasn't me,
Dr. Hamed, it was you.

29:58.144 --> 29:59.406
[sighing]

30:04.237 --> 30:07.022
- Amira! What happened?
- She tripped at dance

30:07.066 --> 30:09.111
and hit her head on the edge
of her stage.

30:09.155 --> 30:10.765
[in Arabic]:

30:13.899 --> 30:15.030
- Why didn't you call me?

30:15.074 --> 30:17.119
- I was rushing
to bring her here!

30:17.163 --> 30:18.425
- Amira?

30:18.468 --> 30:20.209
- Okay. It looks like one wound,
lots of blood.

30:20.253 --> 30:22.211
Let's do a neurological exam
to make sure.

30:22.255 --> 30:24.735
- I don't think that will be
necessary. We'll get someone
to stitch her up.

30:24.779 --> 30:26.302
- Look, sir, I need to do this,
okay?

30:26.346 --> 30:28.217
- Bashir, you can't with family.
You know this.

30:28.261 --> 30:30.480
We'll ask Dr. Hunter,
shall we?

30:30.524 --> 30:33.875
Very dramatic way for us to get
a visit from you, young lady,

30:33.919 --> 30:35.834
but we'll take it.

30:41.274 --> 30:43.058
[soft music]

30:49.717 --> 30:52.851
Sure you didn't join
a fight club since the last
time I saw you?

30:52.894 --> 30:54.853
- Ha ha ha.

30:54.896 --> 30:57.856
- Was that a pity laugh?
- Definite pity laugh.

30:57.899 --> 31:00.597
- Well, I will take it.

31:03.035 --> 31:06.647
Hey, uh, why don't you give
your brother a little wave there

31:06.690 --> 31:08.562
so he gears down?

31:10.520 --> 31:11.913
How you liking the new place?

31:11.957 --> 31:14.481
Must be nice having
another girl around.

31:15.961 --> 31:17.658
- I miss you.

31:17.701 --> 31:19.660
- I miss you too.

31:20.226 --> 31:21.575
Alright.

31:21.618 --> 31:23.446
Let's take a look. Wow.

31:24.230 --> 31:25.753
It looks pretty badass.

31:25.796 --> 31:28.799
How about I bandage that up
and then uh...

31:29.539 --> 31:31.237
maybe you and me, we...
we go in there

31:31.280 --> 31:32.891
and we let him off the hook?

31:36.459 --> 31:39.419
- Can I stay here
a few more minutes?

31:39.462 --> 31:42.465
- You wanna learn
how to apply a dressing?

31:44.772 --> 31:47.949
- Sir, Veronica Garcia lied
about her burn.

31:47.993 --> 31:49.516
She spilled ammonia on her hand

31:49.559 --> 31:51.605
and was too afraid of losing
her job to tell me.

31:51.648 --> 31:52.998
- It was chemical?
Now it's progressed?

31:53.041 --> 31:55.565
- Full thickness with necrosis
from the radius

31:55.609 --> 31:58.786
to the proximal phalanx
of the thumb and forefinger.

31:58.829 --> 32:00.135
- Sensation?

32:00.179 --> 32:03.443
- Minimal. Circulation too.
- What's the plan?

32:03.486 --> 32:05.445
- Escharotomy, but given
the prognosis, the surgeon

32:05.488 --> 32:07.664
is considering amputation.
He says it would take a miracle

32:07.708 --> 32:09.579
to save her hand now.
[groans]

32:09.623 --> 32:11.973
This woman spent the last
10 years making our jobs easier

32:12.017 --> 32:14.802
and if she hadn't burned
herself, I wouldn't even know
she existed.

32:14.845 --> 32:17.370
And I know you said
we can't solve every problem
in this place,

32:17.413 --> 32:19.328
but this place is going
to cost her a limb

32:19.372 --> 32:22.462
and I have a hard time--
What are you doing?

32:22.505 --> 32:24.986
- Well, we can't solve
the problem in the hospital,

32:25.030 --> 32:26.161
we have to widen our reach.

32:26.205 --> 32:27.902
- With an analog phonebook?

32:27.946 --> 32:30.296
- Dr. Karen Balaji.

32:30.339 --> 32:32.863
She's a plastics specialist
at St. Luke's.

32:32.907 --> 32:34.300
I've published with her.

32:34.343 --> 32:37.390
They call her
the tissue resurrector.

32:37.433 --> 32:39.000
- So you'll ask her?

32:39.044 --> 32:40.654
- No, you will.

32:41.611 --> 32:45.050
While I speak to maintenance
about chemicals.

32:45.528 --> 32:47.791
It's good for you to build
these relationships, Mags.

32:47.835 --> 32:51.404
But this thing
with Dr. Fisher...

32:51.447 --> 32:53.972
Haven't we both lived through
the perils of biting off

32:54.015 --> 32:55.103
more than you can chew?

32:55.147 --> 32:57.018
- That's not what this is, sir.

32:57.062 --> 32:59.934
I mean, I don't exactly know
what it is yet, but...

32:59.978 --> 33:01.849
Do you not think I should
do it or...?

33:01.892 --> 33:03.590
- I want you here.

33:03.633 --> 33:04.939
With us.

33:04.983 --> 33:07.028
You better get on that.

33:07.072 --> 33:09.378
Time is...
- Function.

33:16.081 --> 33:18.039
- She's alright.

33:18.518 --> 33:20.694
We'll need to do some
more imaging,

33:20.737 --> 33:23.131
but it's likely
just a small concussion.

33:24.219 --> 33:26.830
Thank you for getting her here.

33:27.788 --> 33:29.877
It wasn't fair
to shout at you.

33:30.225 --> 33:32.532
[in Arabic]:

33:33.794 --> 33:35.143
[sighing]

33:45.980 --> 33:47.851
- Rania.

34:15.357 --> 34:17.751
[dramatic music]

34:20.145 --> 34:24.453
If you don't love me anymore,
you need to tell me.

34:33.331 --> 34:36.552
- Hey, uh, thanks for
taking care of Amira.

34:36.596 --> 34:38.119
- Of course.

34:38.163 --> 34:40.556
Hey, why don't you guys
come by for dinner?

34:40.600 --> 34:43.385
I'll make comfort food.
You can bring Rania too.

34:43.429 --> 34:44.995
- Amira should rest.

34:45.039 --> 34:46.780
- She, uh...

34:47.389 --> 34:50.610
mentioned that things
at home were kinda tricky.

34:50.652 --> 34:52.742
You doing okay?

34:52.786 --> 34:55.266
- What did she say?
- Nothing.

34:55.310 --> 34:59.271
No, just that you and Rania
are still figuring things out.

34:59.314 --> 35:01.229
- You talk to her about that?

35:01.273 --> 35:02.926
- No, I wasn't trying
to talk to her.

35:02.970 --> 35:04.711
- All she needed
was sutures, Theo.

35:04.754 --> 35:06.495
- Look, Bash,
I'm just saying.

35:07.061 --> 35:08.715
They read things.

35:09.281 --> 35:11.587
God knows my daughters
are full of questions,

35:11.631 --> 35:14.068
especially now that their mother
and I are just talking

35:14.112 --> 35:16.201
to lawyers--
- I'll take care of it myself.

35:16.244 --> 35:17.289
Thanks.

35:19.378 --> 35:23.643
- Yeah, fine! Sorry I stepped in
where I'm not needed.

35:26.994 --> 35:28.430
[door slams]

35:30.215 --> 35:33.261
- Dr. Balaji's seen your imaging
and spoken to our team.

35:33.305 --> 35:36.134
If she thinks she can save
your hand, that means she can.

35:36.177 --> 35:37.657
Your sister's gonna meet you
at St. Luke's,

35:37.700 --> 35:39.267
and I'm gonna call in once
you're through to check in.

35:39.311 --> 35:40.747
- Thank you, Mags.
For everything.

35:40.790 --> 35:42.705
- Of course. And I know they
have better food there,

35:42.749 --> 35:44.838
but don't get too comfortable,
we want you back.

35:44.881 --> 35:46.666
[chuckles]

35:48.494 --> 35:49.756
What?

35:52.150 --> 35:53.760
- Are you free tonight?

35:53.803 --> 35:55.631
- Free for what?

35:55.675 --> 35:56.893
- Dinner.

35:57.546 --> 36:02.029
Drinks. Anything you want
really, that's just not here.

36:02.899 --> 36:05.815
- Are you asking me on a date?
You're asking me on a date.

36:05.859 --> 36:08.818
- You're the one who said
to find doors and open them,

36:08.862 --> 36:10.472
so that's what I'm doing.

36:12.822 --> 36:14.215
Okay!

36:14.259 --> 36:16.391
It's, uh, torture trying
to figure out

36:16.435 --> 36:17.827
what's going on in your head
right now.

36:17.871 --> 36:19.873
- Well, right now it's whether
I find you charming

36:19.916 --> 36:21.657
or annoying, I...
- Okay.

36:21.701 --> 36:23.529
Which way are you leaning?

36:25.226 --> 36:27.272
[cheerful music]

36:33.843 --> 36:35.323
- Two sugars.

36:36.846 --> 36:39.022
- I hope there's a better
reason you called me back here

36:39.066 --> 36:41.286
than a crappy apology coffee.

36:41.329 --> 36:43.070
- I'm not apologizing.

36:43.592 --> 36:46.291
You can call me cold
if you want, it's up to you.

36:46.334 --> 36:50.382
I don't need you to understand
my choices with Dad.

36:54.734 --> 36:57.040
But seriously, Charles,
you know that doesn't mean

36:57.084 --> 36:59.391
that I don't want you
in my life, right?

37:01.219 --> 37:06.354
So if you can separate the two,
I know I can.

37:09.923 --> 37:11.446
- Yeah.

37:15.102 --> 37:16.756
[knocking]

37:20.238 --> 37:22.022
- Is he dead?
- No, no.

37:22.065 --> 37:23.371
That's not why I'm here.

37:23.415 --> 37:24.720
[sighing]

37:25.460 --> 37:27.201
- Then, why the hell
are you here?

37:27.245 --> 37:28.898
I haven't seen him.

37:28.942 --> 37:30.422
Not that I'd tell you
if I did.

37:30.465 --> 37:32.685
- I just wanted
to give you this.

37:32.728 --> 37:35.731
Stocked with sterile gauze,
gloves, antibiotics,

37:35.775 --> 37:37.907
antiseptic, and a list of things
to watch for

37:37.951 --> 37:39.779
in case you do see him.

37:40.606 --> 37:43.783
- I know that letting him go
was your way of helping him.

37:48.309 --> 37:50.659
What are the chances
he'll need that stuff?

37:50.703 --> 37:52.400
- He's strong.

37:52.444 --> 37:55.534
The fact that he got up after
surgery the way he did

37:55.577 --> 37:58.580
is encouraging, but...
- He'll need to be looked after.

38:03.368 --> 38:05.935
I kept telling myself that
it was a good thing,

38:05.979 --> 38:08.286
keeping my house safe for him.

38:11.027 --> 38:13.247
Was it just me enabling him?

38:19.209 --> 38:21.342
I'm not ready to lose him.

38:24.171 --> 38:25.912
Thanks for this.

38:30.177 --> 38:32.179
[thunder rumbling]

38:37.315 --> 38:39.839
- Is it a bad idea to date
a med student?

38:39.882 --> 38:41.797
- You talking about Jake?

38:43.799 --> 38:46.846
Politically, probably.

38:46.889 --> 38:49.936
Personality-wise...

38:49.979 --> 38:51.067
Probably.

38:51.111 --> 38:51.851
[chuckles]

38:51.894 --> 38:53.896
Did he ask you out?

38:53.940 --> 38:55.594
- Yeah.

38:55.637 --> 38:57.987
- Okay.
- I think I'm gonna say yes.

38:58.988 --> 39:00.381
- Okay.

39:01.164 --> 39:04.342
- Your brother seems nice.
You two close?

39:09.825 --> 39:12.001
You know if you ever
need to talk.

39:12.045 --> 39:13.568
Okay.

39:13.612 --> 39:15.701
Good night.

39:23.665 --> 39:25.667
- My dad's dying.

39:28.496 --> 39:29.845
[phone ringing]

39:37.810 --> 39:40.203
[soft music]

39:48.211 --> 39:49.387
[clattering]

40:05.315 --> 40:06.882
- Hi.

40:09.537 --> 40:13.193
- I've been made redundant.

40:15.021 --> 40:17.850
They told me yesterday
to start...

40:17.893 --> 40:20.374
thinking about
a transition plan.

40:21.506 --> 40:23.029
[sighing]

40:23.072 --> 40:25.423
- They're pushing you out?

40:27.076 --> 40:28.426
When?

40:29.122 --> 40:32.430
- As soon as I choose my
replacement, according to them.

40:34.432 --> 40:36.434
- I'm so sorry, Jed.

40:38.566 --> 40:40.786
I don't know what to say.

40:42.614 --> 40:44.746
- I'm not done, Claire.

40:58.456 --> 40:59.761
- Amira?

41:00.196 --> 41:03.069
- She went to sleep
an hour ago.

41:08.683 --> 41:11.599
- Look, uh, I know this...

41:12.078 --> 41:15.995
this hasn't been fair
to you and, uh...

41:17.562 --> 41:19.128
I'll do better.

41:25.178 --> 41:27.310
[in Arabic]:

41:50.377 --> 41:52.335
[soft music]

43:21.686 --> 43:23.644
Subtitling: difuze
