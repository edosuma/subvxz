00:01.600 --> 00:03.300
I have a plane waiting for you at the Dover Airfield.

00:03.400 --> 00:06.230
It'll take you anywhere, but you have to tell me where you want to go.

00:07.000 --> 00:09.640
Rome. I'm going to Rome.

00:09.800 --> 00:11.710
And even though everything’s changed,

00:11.910 --> 00:13.170
some things don’t.

00:15.710 --> 00:17.880
I’m not gonna lose you twice.

00:19.000 --> 00:25.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:25.370 --> 03:26.870
If you find anything, you let me know.

03:27.670 --> 03:28.400
Lauren !

03:29.200 --> 03:30.240
I’ll call you back.

03:31.240 --> 03:32.370
Dixon's spoken with the DCI ?

03:32.470 --> 03:33.280
- Yes.
- Good.

03:33.340 --> 03:36.550
I want to make sure we have access to all computer accounts, emails, memos

03:36.650 --> 03:38.950
and correspondence seen in this office in the last two years.

03:39.010 --> 03:40.880
Yes, sir. I already put a request in through Langley.

03:40.950 --> 03:42.990
- Who'd you talk to over there ?
- Brandon. I'm on it.

03:44.720 --> 03:51.190
I understand the Director of Central Intelligence has already conveyed his desire to transfer authority over this taskforce 
from your agency to mine.

03:51.590 --> 03:53.460
I expect you to cooperate fully.

03:53.660 --> 03:56.230
No, not exactly.

03:56.430 --> 03:59.330
I explained to my superiors that the decision 
was mine,

03:59.430 --> 04:04.340
To withhold information from the NSC regarding Sydney Bristow's involvement 
in the Lazarey murder,

04:04.440 --> 04:09.650
and that the members of my staff in question were acting under direct orders from me.

04:10.050 --> 04:10.880
I see.

04:11.010 --> 04:14.320
My staff will remain on active duty and cooperate in any investigation...

04:14.380 --> 04:16.649
They’re not your staff, Mr. Dixon, not anymore.

04:16.779 --> 04:19.220
I'm pulling your clearance until further notice.

04:19.920 --> 04:21.990
Mr. Lindsey, I would expect 
nothing less from you.

04:22.089 --> 04:24.730
One of my men will escort you 
to a facility for questioning.

04:24.860 --> 04:28.730
In the meantime, you’ll need to surrender all credentials and access cards.

04:39.010 --> 04:41.340
Well, of course you'll be questioned as well.

04:41.910 --> 04:44.110
Let's not make this any harder than it has to be.

04:44.750 --> 04:46.220
It's too late for that.

04:47.280 --> 04:49.050
I need to talk to you. Right now !

04:50.590 --> 04:51.820
Before you start,

04:51.950 --> 04:54.220
know that I did what I thought was right 
given the information that...

04:54.320 --> 04:58.490
- Sydney is in Lindsey's custody because of you !
- The Lazarey murder was my assignment !

04:58.590 --> 05:00.130
Sydney murdered a Russian diplomat !

05:00.230 --> 05:02.500
Okay, stop ! 
Don't act like this is your first day on the job !

05:02.560 --> 05:05.670
- Sydney is in NSC custody not…
- No, she is in Lindsey’s custody.

05:05.770 --> 05:09.710
- You think Lindsey’s unaccountable !?
- Lauren, his operation is funded by black money.

05:09.810 --> 05:11.890
What the Whitehouse expects from him 
is results.

05:11.940 --> 05:15.310
What you're suggesting is that I willfully participate in an orchestrated cover-up ?

05:15.410 --> 05:17.780
No, but I would have hoped 
you'd be a person about this.

05:17.880 --> 05:19.480
While you clearly underestimate

05:19.580 --> 05:21.550
not only my ability to do my job

05:21.680 --> 05:23.490
but also apparently my humanity.

05:23.590 --> 05:25.690
you should know that not only do I believe 
I did the right thing,

05:25.750 --> 05:28.520
but the more you talk the more suspicious I get.

05:29.830 --> 05:32.030
You're the one who got her out of the country, aren't you ?

05:34.360 --> 05:36.170
Do you know what would happen to you

05:36.330 --> 05:39.670
if it becomes known that you helped a fugitive evade the federal government ?

05:39.770 --> 05:42.540
I'm not concerned about myself right now.

05:45.770 --> 05:47.710
If what you're suggesting is right,

05:48.480 --> 05:51.310
that to learn what happened to Sydney 
over the past two years

05:51.410 --> 05:55.500
Robert Lindsey intends on having surgery performed on her which will render her brain-dead,

05:55.580 --> 05:58.120
why would he have me write 
the White House brief ?

05:58.250 --> 05:58.850
What ?

05:59.020 --> 06:00.460
He’s asked me to go with him

06:01.060 --> 06:03.760
as an observer of Sydney’s interrogation.

06:03.860 --> 06:05.760
Clearly, he has nothing to hide.

06:06.900 --> 06:11.970
Michael, for whatever reason,

06:12.170 --> 06:14.400
you're overreacting to this.

06:17.440 --> 06:19.440
I don't know how long I'll be gone.

06:19.540 --> 06:21.040
So, I guess I'll see you.

06:53.780 --> 06:55.280
Jack, I wanna be a part of it.

06:55.340 --> 06:57.410
If I knew what you were talking about, 
I’d refuse anyway.

06:57.510 --> 06:59.620
Come on ! I've thought of a half dozen scenarios to help Sydney.

06:59.680 --> 07:01.720
- Lindsey has to be shut down ! He...
- Did your scenarios

07:01.820 --> 07:04.020
take into account that helping Sydney 
at this point

07:04.150 --> 07:06.690
will require breaking 
at least a dozen federal laws ?

07:06.760 --> 07:09.560
Just the fact that you're telling me this means 
you have something planned.

07:09.760 --> 07:11.230
Damn it, let me help !

07:13.430 --> 07:15.560
If something happens to Sydney...

07:17.170 --> 07:19.130
Meet me in the parking garage in three minutes.

07:41.520 --> 07:43.190
What are you doin’ ?

07:45.560 --> 07:47.260
Were you lookin’ for somethin’ ?

07:50.370 --> 07:51.570
Maybe.

07:58.040 --> 08:00.040
If...

08:00.740 --> 08:04.450
If you find any, I'll have some.

08:06.250 --> 08:07.920
If it’s candy...

08:08.950 --> 08:12.420
God, I'd love... candy.

08:14.090 --> 08:15.090
I'm Campbell.

08:17.700 --> 08:18.230
Sydney.

08:21.300 --> 08:23.200
Syd-ney...

08:32.370 --> 08:36.110
Don't leave, okay ? Please...

08:38.409 --> 08:41.720
Been a long time without someone to talk to.

08:46.890 --> 08:49.630
So this contact we're meeting, former NSC ?

08:49.860 --> 08:50.860
No.

08:51.830 --> 08:53.830
How are they going to help us locate Sydney ?

08:54.660 --> 08:56.930
We're waiting for Sloane.

08:58.130 --> 08:59.700
You called Sloane on this ?

09:03.570 --> 09:07.710
You and I will be the prime suspects behind any attempt to free Sydney from NSC custody.

09:07.840 --> 09:11.580
Sloane has agreed to help us make it seem 
as if it were the work of the Covenant.

09:11.680 --> 09:13.320
Do I trust him on this ?

09:13.550 --> 09:15.150
Not necessarily.

09:22.760 --> 09:23.760
Gentlemen.

09:24.890 --> 09:27.630
According to my sources, Sydney is being held 
at Camp Williams.

09:28.160 --> 09:30.770
Camp Williams is a naval training facility. 
Why would Lindsey take her there ?

09:30.870 --> 09:33.340
Because it's home to an unacknowledged NSC detention center

09:33.440 --> 09:37.740
used for the interrogation of suspected terrorists whose captivity the government won't admit to.

09:37.810 --> 09:39.580
Tell the helper we'll need a tactical team.

09:39.680 --> 09:40.680
At least 8 men.

09:40.780 --> 09:43.010
Transportation, weapons, specialized backup.

09:43.350 --> 09:44.450
I would suggest Brill.

09:44.580 --> 09:45.650
I thought he was in Freetown.

09:45.750 --> 09:47.480
Oh, no, not since the government fell.

09:47.580 --> 09:49.250
If he's available, Domier would know.

09:49.350 --> 09:51.320
We'll need to get a hold of blueprints 
to Camp Williams.

09:51.390 --> 09:53.120
The FEMA Central Office downtown,

09:53.220 --> 09:55.060
they should have a set of blueprints on file.

09:55.120 --> 09:55.820
Good.

09:56.060 --> 09:58.130
We'll prep infiltration into the FEMA building.

09:58.690 --> 10:00.460
Meet back here in three hours.

10:01.230 --> 10:02.630
I told you, Jack,

10:03.730 --> 10:06.400
we'd work together again.

10:35.900 --> 10:37.500
Just so we're clear,

10:37.600 --> 10:39.800
it's in all our best interests to make sure

10:40.000 --> 10:42.670
that no one on the Hill questions 
our ethics, Lauren.

10:43.040 --> 10:45.270
That's why I'm counting on you 
to write a thorough report

10:45.370 --> 10:49.950
chronicling our investigation to date 
and our fair treatment of Sydney Bristow.

10:51.280 --> 10:52.480
Understood ?

11:06.000 --> 11:07.430
Tie her ! Tie her !

11:12.130 --> 11:14.740
But Sydney's made it very clear 
she doesn't remember anything.

11:14.840 --> 11:16.410
But when we searched her flat in Rome,

11:16.540 --> 11:19.040
we found a coded message taped 
to the underside of her desk.

11:19.140 --> 11:21.110
Now, if she can decode that message,

11:21.240 --> 11:22.640
it may help us infiltrate

11:22.740 --> 11:24.950
or possibly even take down the Covenant.

11:26.620 --> 11:28.250
What if she doesn't recognize the code ?

11:28.780 --> 11:31.450
As long as she demonstrates 
a willingness to cooperate,

11:31.650 --> 11:33.890
that surgery will be nothing more than a threat.

11:43.600 --> 11:47.100
Ms. Bristow, we know you know 
how to read this code.

11:48.440 --> 11:50.740
Do you recognize your handwriting ?

11:51.340 --> 11:52.310
No.

11:54.080 --> 12:00.020
I draw little hearts over my "I" 's. 
Smiley-faces sometimes.

12:02.220 --> 12:03.590
What you're feeling now,

12:03.690 --> 12:05.350
the pain from shock therapy,

12:05.490 --> 12:06.960
it's nothing.

12:07.060 --> 12:09.760
There's another procedure : neuro-stimulation.

12:09.860 --> 12:12.560
We can use it to find out where you've been 
the last two years.

12:14.530 --> 12:18.670
Decipher the text and we won't have to.

12:18.770 --> 12:20.740
Don't bother negotiating with me !

12:24.610 --> 12:27.640
You'd better make sure I'm a vegetable 
when you're done with me.

12:32.510 --> 12:34.520
Try a higher setting.

12:41.920 --> 12:45.260
The human body is an amazing machine !

12:46.200 --> 12:48.930
In a couple of hours, 
you'll almost feel human again.

12:53.540 --> 12:55.540
You have a strong heart, though.

12:56.270 --> 13:00.110
Survive another five, six sessions,

13:00.780 --> 13:02.480
That'll be a new record

13:03.380 --> 13:05.050
for both of us.

13:11.750 --> 13:13.960
I thought I was supposed to be observing.

13:14.520 --> 13:15.720
And you will

13:15.820 --> 13:17.060
as much as possible.

13:17.160 --> 13:20.830
But my interrogation of Agent Bristow includes 
a discussion of classified material.

13:21.460 --> 13:24.500
How can I report on an investigation 
I'm not a part of ?

13:24.600 --> 13:25.600
We can talk about it.

13:25.670 --> 13:27.100
Come on ! I'll brief you on what I can.

13:27.200 --> 13:28.300
I'm sorry.

13:29.240 --> 13:33.110
but if I'm going to chronicle our treatment 
of Sydney Bristow, I need to see 
how she's being treated.

13:37.380 --> 13:40.220
How do you suppose it was 
that Sydney Bristow knew to flee the country

13:40.320 --> 13:44.250
before she was even aware the NSC wanted 
to take her into custody ?

13:46.390 --> 13:47.890
With plane tickets ?

13:47.990 --> 13:49.160
Fake passport ?

13:50.730 --> 13:56.330
I doubt you want me looking into who it was 
that aided and abetted the escape 
of a wanted fugitive.

14:00.670 --> 14:03.070
That's why you asked for me.

14:03.310 --> 14:05.370
Legally, you needed a witness.

14:05.710 --> 14:07.710
Get to your office.

14:07.910 --> 14:09.810
You have a report to write.

14:26.900 --> 14:28.030
Sydney...

14:31.230 --> 14:33.200
They didn't give you one.

14:36.370 --> 14:40.440
It's... cold at night.

14:40.710 --> 14:41.510
Thank you.

14:46.820 --> 14:51.790
This is not the best place.

14:58.590 --> 15:01.900
They wanted to know about Iran,

15:03.100 --> 15:07.170
when I was there, assigned.

15:10.170 --> 15:12.710
What do they want to know about you ?

15:19.380 --> 15:21.950
Don't give it to 'em !

15:52.310 --> 15:54.550
That's checkmate in three moves.

15:54.650 --> 15:55.920
Want to give me my fifty bucks now

15:56.150 --> 15:58.120
or do you we go through the motions ?

15:58.220 --> 15:59.320
I've got all day.

16:04.530 --> 16:06.730
That's not tuition money, is it ?

16:13.400 --> 16:15.570
I'll put you in checkmate in ten moves.

16:18.340 --> 16:20.510
Yeah, if I play with my eyes closed.

16:22.110 --> 16:23.380
Long time.

16:24.410 --> 16:25.950
Chile, '73.

16:26.480 --> 16:29.050
Should have never helped overthrow Allende.

16:29.250 --> 16:31.120
Thomas Brill, Michael Vaughn.

16:32.860 --> 16:34.020
Bill Vaughn's kid ?

16:35.920 --> 16:37.360
Yeah, he was my father.

16:37.590 --> 16:40.260
No kidding ? He was a good man.

16:41.400 --> 16:42.160
Thank you.

16:43.930 --> 16:46.170
Any interest in a high-risk extraction ?

16:46.870 --> 16:48.570
Always. Paint me a picture.

16:48.840 --> 16:50.770
Camp Williams detention center.

16:51.440 --> 16:53.480
- Blind ?
- Blueprints.

16:53.810 --> 16:55.210
Sloane's designing the op.

16:55.780 --> 16:58.380
Well, look who's putting the band back together !

17:00.320 --> 17:01.780
Rules of engagement ?

17:01.980 --> 17:04.550
Facility's protected by two dozen DOD personnel.

17:04.650 --> 17:06.589
Lethal force is not an option.

17:06.920 --> 17:09.890
Well, if we're going to use tranqs, 
we're going to need another five freelancers.

17:09.990 --> 17:11.290
It's not going to be cheap, Jack.

17:11.390 --> 17:13.099
two-fifty k per hire.

17:14.099 --> 17:16.170
Another 9 for the chopper.

17:16.329 --> 17:20.440
For the non-lethal gunmetal, add another six.

17:20.640 --> 17:22.170
Done.

17:22.400 --> 17:25.569
Meet me at this address in two hours.

17:28.740 --> 17:29.680
Checkmate.

17:34.080 --> 17:35.880
You just agreed to pay him two million dollars.

17:36.190 --> 17:37.190
Three.

17:45.130 --> 17:46.660
What the hell is this ?

17:46.800 --> 17:47.930
Storage.

18:01.080 --> 18:03.050
The fact that you're even letting me see 
this place means

18:03.150 --> 18:04.810
it's not your only one, is it ?

18:05.610 --> 18:07.450
You're smarter than you look.

18:25.700 --> 18:26.600
Ms. Bristow !

18:27.800 --> 18:28.700
You look better !

18:29.640 --> 18:31.470
Yeah, I feel great. 
Thanks.

18:31.540 --> 18:33.740
I hear you're making friends with your cellmate.

18:34.040 --> 18:35.440
He's a journalist, you know,

18:35.610 --> 18:36.610
from the Middle East.

18:37.110 --> 18:39.450
Story is he died in a car accident.

18:39.950 --> 18:41.950
Truth is he was protecting his source.

18:42.520 --> 18:44.750
Thought the first amendment would protect him.

18:45.420 --> 18:46.760
He was strong, though, like you...

19:09.180 --> 19:12.610
Code red ! Prisoner loose in corridor R-33. 
Initiate lockdown procedures.

19:14.010 --> 19:14.980
Okay, I'm on it !

19:26.030 --> 19:26.560
Hold her !

19:49.790 --> 19:52.320
I found the junction box 
and planted the video scrambler.

19:53.720 --> 19:55.990
When you activate this, 
it'll lock down the security system

19:56.090 --> 19:58.260
for as long as it takes you to copy the blueprints.

19:58.560 --> 19:59.360
Any word from Brill ?

19:59.460 --> 20:02.730
He should have the team hired and equipment 
by tonight, as long as we're successful

20:02.800 --> 20:03.930
and get the blueprints.

20:04.530 --> 20:05.530
Here we go.

20:06.300 --> 20:08.770
Okay, I got us into the trunk exchange.

20:08.870 --> 20:12.840
Now every incoming and outgoing call 
to the FEMA building will be rerouted 
through this number.

20:13.480 --> 20:14.410
Get ready.

20:20.380 --> 20:22.350
Sir, we lost picture.

20:26.890 --> 20:28.390
Weller security, can you hold ?

20:28.490 --> 20:31.890
No, I can't. This is the L.A. EOC. 
All my screens just went blank.

20:32.030 --> 20:33.000
Did you reboot ?

20:33.100 --> 20:34.060
We're doing it now.

20:34.160 --> 20:35.860
Well, I've got a man in the area. 
I'll send him over.

20:41.370 --> 20:43.700
Yeah, yeah, I got a call. You guys down ?

20:44.000 --> 20:45.940
- Where's Stewart ?
- Sick.

20:46.210 --> 20:49.110
Got a nasal infection. 
Freaking Nightmare !

20:52.310 --> 20:53.980
I've been doing this longer than you.

20:54.520 --> 20:56.390
Jack could have taken a camera in there.

20:56.990 --> 20:59.560
They sweep him and find a camera, 
this is all over.

21:01.620 --> 21:04.090
Federal security measures require 
that we make a thorough search.

21:04.190 --> 21:06.060
Hey, I'm new, but I'm not new, alright ?

21:06.160 --> 21:07.300
I know the protocol ?

21:07.400 --> 21:08.960
Then you know I gotta stay with you at all times.

21:09.060 --> 21:11.430
Right, right, just give me the tools, 
show me the way.

21:21.380 --> 21:22.540
Right over here.

21:29.720 --> 21:30.790
This shouldn't take too long.

21:30.890 --> 21:33.890
In the meantime, you might want to make sure your data files are backed up.

21:33.960 --> 21:36.230
- I already did.
- Right.

21:41.530 --> 21:45.370
Having spent a significant amount of time 
with your wife over the last year.

21:45.470 --> 21:48.570
I think it's safe to say that you're a lucky man.

21:50.640 --> 21:51.370
Yes, I am.

21:53.910 --> 21:59.380
I imagine that all of this is something of a strain on your relationship.

22:00.820 --> 22:02.650
Terminal 12 will take us up.

22:14.730 --> 22:15.630
Make the call.

22:17.700 --> 22:18.970
Federal Emergency Management.

22:19.030 --> 22:20.640
Yeah, this is Director Blackman,

22:20.740 --> 22:23.470
I've just been pulled from a meeting 
with the Secretary of Defense

22:23.610 --> 22:26.140
to find out that your branch has been dark 
for the past thirty minutes.

22:26.510 --> 22:27.810
Yes, we're working on it.

22:27.910 --> 22:29.410
My supervisor's in with the technician now...

22:29.550 --> 22:30.650
Whoa, son, son !

22:30.780 --> 22:36.490
Now I'm sure that you're aware that the chances of a terrorist attack on the city of Los Angeles 
is extraordinarily high.

22:36.590 --> 22:39.050
And if - God forbid - something like that 
should befall us,

22:39.220 --> 22:44.560
I would expect that the central office tasked 
with the management of such an emergency 
would be prepared.

22:44.660 --> 22:47.760
So, why don't you get your supervisor 
on the line right now ?

22:48.800 --> 22:51.730
Sir, director Blackman's on Blue.

22:51.800 --> 22:53.440
You need to speak with him. Now.

22:53.570 --> 22:55.600
I'm on my way. 
You wait here.

23:27.510 --> 23:28.700
There he is.

23:30.640 --> 23:33.040
- Go check on the alarm guy.
- Yes, sir.

23:35.340 --> 23:36.480
Director Blackman.

23:47.490 --> 23:51.530
As I'm sure you're aware, the people of Los Angeles face a myriad of potential disaster.

23:57.430 --> 23:59.270
No, we're not just talking about terrorism.

23:59.330 --> 24:01.500
In case you haven't noticed, 
we're due for another earthquake.

24:01.600 --> 24:03.210
Plus, because of the recent forest fire,

24:03.310 --> 24:04.670
we're susceptible to mudslide.

24:04.770 --> 24:09.650
Not to mention the fact that there seems to be a riot breaking out every time the Lakers win.

24:12.950 --> 24:14.520
Just make sure you get it done.

24:18.190 --> 24:19.450
That'll do it.

24:21.790 --> 24:23.930
- Should be back online.
- Great.

24:30.430 --> 24:31.400
Take it easy.

24:31.970 --> 24:34.370
Get Blackman. He’ll wanna know 
we’re back online right away.

24:35.640 --> 24:37.040
Director Blackman, please.

24:39.740 --> 24:41.080
Out of the country !?

24:41.210 --> 24:43.250
I just spoke with him, he said 
he was in Washington !

24:48.800 --> 24:49.890
Stop where you are !

24:51.190 --> 24:53.260
Stop where you are ! 
Hands in the air !

25:06.540 --> 25:07.700
Get him down on the table.

25:08.740 --> 25:09.710
Easy.

25:16.550 --> 25:17.880
Get some four-by-fours.

25:22.990 --> 25:24.350
Just breathe. Just breathe.

25:25.850 --> 25:28.320
Okay, keep pressure applied to the wound.

25:33.000 --> 25:34.500
- What is that ?
- Morphine.

25:34.600 --> 25:37.400
No, no morphine. I'll go into anaphylactic shock.

25:37.500 --> 25:39.430
Arvin, we have to dig the bullet out.

25:39.500 --> 25:42.970
If you give me morphine, I'll be dead 
before you get to the bullet.

25:43.610 --> 25:45.240
Don't get any ideas.

25:48.410 --> 25:51.380
I have to do this, to keep you from thrashing.

25:52.750 --> 25:55.820
Give me your belt to bite down on.

25:55.920 --> 25:57.090
- Oh, I don't need a belt !
- Just do it !

25:59.050 --> 26:00.290
I need some light.

26:13.900 --> 26:15.840
- He passed out.
- Good.

26:16.540 --> 26:17.670
Almost.

26:38.120 --> 26:39.430
Good morning.

26:41.060 --> 26:42.130
Hi.

26:47.500 --> 26:49.040
Think about the ocean.

26:51.270 --> 26:54.340
When I don't feel good, that's what I do.

26:57.050 --> 27:00.450
My son liked boats.

27:02.350 --> 27:10.630
He... was... 6.

27:14.560 --> 27:18.430
Maybe... he's still 6.

27:19.070 --> 27:20.970
I think...

27:23.510 --> 27:26.180
I think he's older... now.

27:34.750 --> 27:36.790
What is your son's name ?

27:39.250 --> 27:48.060
His name was Benjamin. 
Benjamin...

27:57.170 --> 27:58.650
I can't believe I'm actually going to ask this

27:58.710 --> 27:59.840
but is he going to be alright ?

28:00.710 --> 28:01.940
He'll recover.

28:02.440 --> 28:05.150
The bullet nearly pierced his axillary artery.

28:07.220 --> 28:08.650
I didn't know you wore glasses.

28:09.480 --> 28:11.050
Only during surgery.

28:13.660 --> 28:16.020
Well, I'm going to go download the blueprints from the digital camera.

28:16.120 --> 28:19.030
But we're still going to need security codes 
to get into Camp Williams.

28:19.130 --> 28:20.100
Try Marshall.

28:20.300 --> 28:24.430
He should be able to log onto the NSC archive from his station at the rotunda.

28:24.500 --> 28:27.470
That's going to be a little tricky 
with all the NSC agents crawling everywhere.

28:27.640 --> 28:28.400
Yes...

28:28.470 --> 28:31.740
If only Marshall had a well-trained CIA operative to assist him...

28:34.310 --> 28:36.410
You're starting to like me again.

28:38.550 --> 28:39.350
Vaughn...

28:40.720 --> 28:43.050
With or without those codes,

28:43.650 --> 28:46.260
we'll be infiltrating Camp Williams in five hours.

28:52.390 --> 28:54.360
Here's your draft.

28:54.700 --> 28:56.030
I think you'll like it.

28:57.530 --> 29:00.140
If I was tough on you before, I apologize.

29:00.970 --> 29:02.370
I'm not naive.

29:02.700 --> 29:04.540
I understand that, under certain circumstances,

29:04.640 --> 29:06.740
unorthodox methods may be required.

29:06.810 --> 29:09.780
But that doesn't excuse your blackmailing me 
by threatening to arrest my husband.

29:09.880 --> 29:12.880
Yeah, don't mention Van Sohn. 
His reputation precedes him.

29:12.950 --> 29:17.650
And nothing about Campbell or the other prisoners. Just stick with Bristow.

29:18.590 --> 29:20.090
Yeah, the rest is fine.

29:21.020 --> 29:24.890
Deliver this to Miller. He has operational control of the rotunda while I'm here.

29:25.260 --> 29:29.130
We'll want you back in... six hours to report 
on the final results.

29:43.910 --> 29:45.550
Marshall, if I needed you to access classified...

29:45.650 --> 29:48.250
Hey, check this out. Look. 
Telephoto lenses based on an owl's eye.

29:48.250 --> 29:50.490
Now, let's say you're out in the field doing... 
and you need to get...

29:50.590 --> 29:53.220
you just press this button and...

29:53.590 --> 29:54.860
Nice pores, do you exfoliate ?

29:54.960 --> 29:58.290
Okay, if I need you to access classified documents on the NSC computers network, 
can you do it ?

29:58.390 --> 29:59.600
No, I don't have access.

29:59.700 --> 30:00.730
I know.

30:04.900 --> 30:07.070
Forensic guys are monitoring the network.

30:07.200 --> 30:08.740
Isn't there any way to bypass that ?

30:08.840 --> 30:11.240
Of course, it's me. But...

30:23.520 --> 30:25.550
I give you the codes, you're going to bust her out, aren't you ?

30:25.650 --> 30:27.160
Kick some NSC booty ?

30:27.660 --> 30:29.730
Can I just say... Love !

30:34.230 --> 30:37.830
I've been trying to think of a single reason 
why you saved my life.

30:38.570 --> 30:43.210
The only thing I've come to is that would incur some feeling of debt on my part.

30:43.670 --> 30:45.510
As usual, Jack,

30:46.240 --> 30:48.710
you're in danger of outsmarting yourself.

30:51.680 --> 30:54.820
The U.S. government has pardoned me 
for my crimes.

30:55.250 --> 30:58.890
The international community regards me 
as a humanitarian.

31:01.460 --> 31:05.360
Yet, you and Sydney still believe 
I'm pursuing some hidden agenda.

31:07.700 --> 31:10.970
Now, whatever you may perceive 
that agenda to be,

31:11.100 --> 31:15.870
clearly it would be easier to obtain 
if you were both dead

31:17.340 --> 31:20.640
given that you're my most vocal detractors,

31:20.740 --> 31:23.750
my most capable antagonists.

31:24.210 --> 31:26.720
Or you need us for something,

31:27.180 --> 31:29.590
something you believe only we can provide.

31:32.490 --> 31:34.290
Well, you're right about that.

31:36.020 --> 31:42.300
No humanitarian endeavor can ever fill the void left by my past crimes.

31:44.030 --> 31:46.670
With the death of my wife,

31:47.940 --> 31:51.970
you and Sydney are my absolution, my penance.

31:53.410 --> 31:55.240
You're all I have left.

32:00.050 --> 32:01.920
- Anything ?
- Just about.

32:02.990 --> 32:04.220
It should be.

32:06.760 --> 32:07.320
What ?

32:07.620 --> 32:10.560
Well, the file that would have the access codes has been deleted.

32:12.230 --> 32:15.430
All records pertaining to Camp Williams 
have been removed.

32:18.200 --> 32:19.330
Michael !

32:25.070 --> 32:26.680
Actually, I'm going to take off

32:26.740 --> 32:30.750
because this is something 
I should definitely not... Pardon me.

32:34.380 --> 32:36.120
You were right about Lindsey.

32:36.390 --> 32:39.520
I thought I could exercise some degree of control over the interrogation

32:39.620 --> 32:42.490
but he just wanted me to write a report whitewashing the whole thing.

32:44.130 --> 32:46.330
I know you're working on something.

32:47.230 --> 32:48.730
I want to help.

33:05.980 --> 33:06.480
On your feet. Let's go !

33:07.250 --> 33:08.220
On your feet !

33:12.920 --> 33:14.920
Hey ! What are you doing to him ?

33:15.520 --> 33:17.090
That all depends on you.

33:23.130 --> 33:24.630
Help me out, Syd.

33:25.800 --> 33:26.440
Wait.

33:26.540 --> 33:27.700
There's no time to wait.

33:30.040 --> 33:32.710
You son of a bitch ! Leave him alone ! 
This has nothing to do with him !

33:32.710 --> 33:36.140
- You can stop this by deciphering the code.
- I will kill you from this !

33:37.910 --> 33:39.350
Oh my God ! Stop !

33:39.420 --> 33:41.620
Stop ! I'll tell you what it says !

33:44.520 --> 33:45.790
They're coordinates.

33:46.260 --> 33:47.520
To what ?

33:47.760 --> 33:48.890
I don't know.

33:48.990 --> 33:51.990
For the hundredth time, I don't remember anything about those two years.

33:52.060 --> 33:54.030
All I can tell you is what they are.

33:54.600 --> 33:56.370
Tell me.

34:00.100 --> 34:04.270
North 34 degrees 09 minutes 55.9 seconds.

34:04.340 --> 34:08.940
West 118 degrees 17 minutes 15.3 seconds.

34:09.980 --> 34:11.480
Get a team prepped.

34:17.690 --> 34:18.920
Well done.

34:30.670 --> 34:31.570
Oh my God !

34:38.940 --> 34:41.739
I'm not Campbell. I'm Shapker.

34:43.110 --> 34:46.679
Your personality profile revealed 
your one major weakness :

34:47.550 --> 34:53.860
empathetic suffering is harder for you to sustain than physical torture.

34:56.860 --> 35:01.030
So... thanks for caring.

35:06.130 --> 35:08.100
There's just one procedure left, Agent Bristow.

35:08.200 --> 35:11.540
We'll have the neuro-stimulation prepped 
in about an hour.

35:11.640 --> 35:14.540
And we'll finally know what happened to you 
in the last two years.

35:24.550 --> 35:26.090
This is a cranial shunt.

35:27.260 --> 35:29.630
After I drill a hole in your skull,

35:29.830 --> 35:32.290
I'll use it to drain the water from your brainpan.

35:32.490 --> 35:35.760
Once you're unconscious, we'll remove 
your skullcap

35:36.000 --> 35:37.930
and begin the neuro-stimulation.

35:42.140 --> 35:43.470
We have an operative inside

35:43.440 --> 35:47.980
who will gain access to the security room 
and initiate a reverse lockdown protocol,

35:48.110 --> 35:52.150
thereby containing the bulk of the MPs 
in their patrol areas.

35:52.210 --> 35:56.550
Once entry is made, we'll proceed 
to the restricted cellblock 
where Agent Bristow is being held.

35:57.390 --> 35:59.590
I hope your man on the inside knows 
what he's doing.

36:00.090 --> 36:01.360
She does.

36:02.860 --> 36:05.030
I have Lauren Reed here to see Director Lindsey.

36:05.040 --> 36:06.030
Wait here.

36:06.100 --> 36:07.630
I'll let him know you're on base.

36:19.370 --> 36:21.410
I hate to ask the obvious.

36:21.880 --> 36:23.350
What's taking so long ?

36:24.180 --> 36:28.920
The override program has to be placed 
within 5 inches of the central control station.

36:29.280 --> 36:33.120
Once that happens, it'll lock down 
the internal doors and open that main gate.

36:33.320 --> 36:34.620
Then we move.

36:35.560 --> 36:38.990
- Gonna need a chopper to Fort Lewis.
- Yes sir, I'll check with the duty officer.

36:40.300 --> 36:41.660
Lauren Reed...

36:43.000 --> 36:45.470
Directory Lindsey's told me all about you.

36:46.100 --> 36:49.070
Says you're going to write a stellar report for us.

36:57.050 --> 36:58.080
Here we go.

37:08.620 --> 37:09.490
What is it ?

37:09.590 --> 37:10.760
Something's overriding the system.

37:10.790 --> 37:12.730
We're locked in. All the doors are sealed.

37:15.330 --> 37:16.470
What did you do ?

37:17.070 --> 37:18.100
Nothing.

37:21.400 --> 37:24.270
Secure the perimeter. We can't afford to have 
any hostiles on this floor.

37:26.810 --> 37:27.540
I got it.

37:36.890 --> 37:37.890
She's not here.

38:04.610 --> 38:05.480
Sydney !

38:10.690 --> 38:11.520
- Sydney !
- Dad !

38:11.620 --> 38:12.790
You're all right, sweetie.

38:12.890 --> 38:13.660
You're all right.

38:55.360 --> 38:56.870
He's with us. Get in.

39:26.960 --> 39:29.030
They wanted a code deciphered.

39:32.030 --> 39:37.640
That's what all of this was about. 
A code.

39:37.740 --> 39:38.970
What was it ?

39:39.170 --> 39:40.410
Coordinates.

39:44.280 --> 39:46.720
I gave Lindsey the wrong coordinates.

39:49.620 --> 39:51.520
I didn't know what to do.

39:58.390 --> 40:00.000
You made it, Sydney.

40:03.030 --> 40:04.270
You made it.

40:23.810 --> 40:27.010
