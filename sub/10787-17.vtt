ALWAYS RESORT

10:11.583 --> 10:12.458
THIS IS STUPID.

10:12.458 --> 10:14.375
PRETEND LIKE IT'S NOT.
FOR ME.

10:14.375 --> 10:15.458
WHY? SO, THEN YOU'LL
TELL ME THE POINT

10:15.458 --> 10:17.083
OF REMEMBERING
SOME RIDICULOUS CONVERSATION

10:17.083 --> 10:18.458
THAT OBVIOUSLY MEANT
NOTHING TO ME AT THE TIME.

10:18.458 --> 10:21.333
PERHAPS IT DID
MEAN NOTHING TO YOU
AT THE TIME,

10:21.333 --> 10:23.834
BUT OBVIOUSLY IT MEANS
A GREAT DEAL TO YOU NOW.

10:23.834 --> 10:26.333
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I WANT TO LEAVE.

10:26.333 --> 10:28.750
DO YOU?

10:28.750 --> 10:29.625
OR DO YOU WANT TO STAY
AND FIND OUT

10:29.625 --> 10:32.291
WHY THIS IS SO HARD
FOR YOU?

10:37.333 --> 10:39.708
YOU KNOW, BODIE'S GOTTA
STOP BUYING IN BULK.

10:39.708 --> 10:42.291
YOU GOT 11 PEOPLE
COMING OVER.

10:42.291 --> 10:43.291
WE GOT ENOUGH
CHARCOAL HERE

10:43.291 --> 10:45.708
TO BARBECUE
THROUGH LABOR DAY.

10:45.708 --> 10:46.667
YOU WANT SOME HELP?

10:46.667 --> 10:49.708
AND RISK MY BUMBLING
SUPERHERO STATUS?

10:49.708 --> 10:49.959
NO, THANK YOU.

10:53.208 --> 10:55.125
PACE...

10:55.125 --> 10:56.917
LOOK.

10:56.917 --> 11:00.333
I KNOW THAT WE HAVEN'T
REALLY DISCUSSED US YET.

11:00.333 --> 11:03.500
I'M STILL TRYING TO PROCESS
THIS WHOLE COLLEGE THING.

11:03.500 --> 11:04.458
YOU KNOW, IT'S...

11:04.458 --> 11:06.917
KINDA WEIRD
TO GET YOUR DREAM.

11:06.917 --> 11:09.333
I KNOW IT.
I SAY THAT EVERY TIME
I LOOK AT YOU.

11:09.333 --> 11:12.208
YOU ALWAYS DO THAT.
YOU CHANGE THE SUBJECT.

11:12.208 --> 11:14.542
JOEY, WE'RE NOT TALKING
ABOUT THIS TODAY,

11:14.542 --> 11:16.375
BECAUSE WE'RE
NOT TALKING ABOUT
ANYTHING NEGATIVE TODAY,

11:16.375 --> 11:18.333
BECAUSE TODAY IS
YOUR DAY TO CELEBRATE

11:18.333 --> 11:19.750
THIS MOST AMAZING
ACCOMPLISHMENT

11:19.750 --> 11:22.917
THAT YOU HAVE WORKED
SO HARD FOR.

11:22.917 --> 11:24.208
OK. I'M GONNA GO
TO THE GARAGE

11:24.208 --> 11:25.417
AND GET A DOLLY
BEFORE I GIVE MYSELF
A HERNIA.

11:25.417 --> 11:27.583
SO, I'LL SEE YOU INSIDE.

11:52.917 --> 11:58.041
YOU'RE BACK. IT LOOKS
LIKE EVERYONE RSVPed.

11:58.041 --> 12:00.583
JO, WHAT'S WRONG?

12:00.583 --> 12:02.875
I GOT THE FINANCIAL AID
PACKAGE.

12:02.875 --> 12:05.041
AND? HOW MUCH
IS A FULL RIDE?

12:05.041 --> 12:06.875
I WOULDN'T KNOW.

12:06.875 --> 12:09.208
ACCORDING TO THIS,

12:09.208 --> 12:10.875
WORTHINGTON IS HAPPY
TO HAVE ME

12:10.875 --> 12:13.542
SO LONG AS MY PARENTS
KICK IN $15,000.

12:13.542 --> 12:15.375
$15,000?!
THAT CAN'T BE RIGHT.

12:15.375 --> 12:16.917
WE DON'T HAVE
THAT KIND OF MONEY.

12:16.917 --> 12:18.125
I KNOW THAT.

12:22.291 --> 12:25.250
I KNEW THIS WAS
TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE.

12:25.250 --> 12:26.583
IT'S THE UNIVERSE'S WAY
OF SAYING,

12:26.583 --> 12:28.583
"JOEY POTTER, NOT SO FAST.

12:28.583 --> 12:33.625
YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE."

12:37.041 --> 12:39.417
SO, WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS
THAT WE'RE BEING PENALIZED

12:39.417 --> 12:42.375
BECAUSE OUR FAMILY BUSINESS
IS ACTUALLY MAKING MONEY.

12:42.375 --> 12:44.750
IF IT WEREN'T, THEN WE
WOULD QUALIFY FOR MORE AID.

12:44.750 --> 12:46.125
UNFORTUNATELY, YES.

12:46.125 --> 12:47.083
WE TURNED A PROFIT
FOR THE FIRST TIME,

12:47.083 --> 12:49.250
BUT IT WASN'T LIKE
WE WON THE LOTTERY.

12:49.250 --> 12:50.458
BUT YOU MADE
SUBSTANTIALLY MORE

12:50.458 --> 12:51.583
THAN YOUR 1999 RETURN.

12:51.583 --> 12:53.250
YEAH, BUT WE HAVE MORE DEBT
THAN WE DID IN 1999.

12:53.250 --> 12:56.083
I MEAN, IT COSTS A LOT
OF MONEY TO OPEN A B AND B.

12:56.083 --> 12:58.333
HOW CAN THEY THINK
THAT WE CAN AFFORD $15,000?

12:58.333 --> 12:59.834
BASED ON ONE YEAR'S INCOME?

12:59.834 --> 13:02.458
I DIDN'T SAY THAT
THE SYSTEM WAS FAIR, JOEY.

13:04.250 --> 13:07.041
THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.
I...

13:09.083 --> 13:10.625
SHOULD'VE APPLIED
FOR MORE SCHOLARSHIPS,

13:10.625 --> 13:11.875
BUT IT'S TOO LATE NOW.

13:11.875 --> 13:14.375
LOOK, I KNOW THAT WE'VE TALKED
ABOUT HIS BEFORE, JOEY,

13:14.375 --> 13:16.500
BUT THERE ARE STUDENT LOANS.

13:16.500 --> 13:18.542
NEARLY EVERYONE THESE DAYS
BORROWS SOME MONEY

13:18.542 --> 13:19.333
TO PAY FOR COLLEGE.

13:19.333 --> 13:20.125
NO, I DON'T WANT
TO GRADUATE

13:20.125 --> 13:21.458
AND BE OVER $60,000
IN DEBT.

13:21.458 --> 13:24.125
I CAN'T START OFF
MY LIFE THAT WAY.
I WON'T.

13:24.125 --> 13:26.542
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

13:26.542 --> 13:27.708
THERE ARE PLENTY
OF OTHER PLACES

13:27.708 --> 13:28.667
I'M WAITING
TO HEAR FROM.

13:28.667 --> 13:30.291
Bessie: BUT THIS IS
YOUR DREAM, JOEY.

13:30.291 --> 13:32.166
BESSIE...

13:32.166 --> 13:35.458
SOMETIMES DREAMS
DON'T ALWAYS COME TRUE.

13:35.458 --> 13:36.667
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

13:48.291 --> 13:50.458
THE BARBECUE?
THAT'S THE LAST
THING YOU NEED.

13:50.458 --> 13:51.291
I'LL SEND EVERYONE
HOME.

13:51.291 --> 13:53.792
NO.

13:53.792 --> 13:56.208
LOOK, YOU'RE NOT
SENDING THEM ANYWHERE.

13:56.208 --> 13:58.250
JO--

13:58.250 --> 13:59.750
AND YOU'RE NOT TELLING THEM
ANYTHING, BESSIE.

13:59.750 --> 14:03.750
I'M SERIOUS. NOT A WORD.

14:09.834 --> 14:11.708
HEY, THERE, STRANGER.
I WAS STARTING TO THINK

14:11.708 --> 14:13.834
YOU MIGHT MISS
YOUR OWN PARTY.

14:13.834 --> 14:15.041
NO SUCH LUCK.

14:15.375 --> 14:17.250
HUH?

14:17.250 --> 14:19.166
HEY, DAWSON.
HEY, BESSIE.

14:19.166 --> 14:20.208
WHY DON'T I TAKE
THAT FROM YOU?

14:20.208 --> 14:22.125
I'M GOING IN
ANYWAY.

14:22.125 --> 14:24.208
OH, THANKS.

14:24.208 --> 14:25.333
SO, WHERE IS EVERYBODY?

14:25.333 --> 14:27.000
THEY'RE OUT BACK.
GRETCHEN GOT DRAGGED

14:27.000 --> 14:28.417
INTO THE WHOLE
NEW YORK DEBATE.

14:28.417 --> 14:30.333
I WOULD'VE JUMPED IN,
BUT, YOU KNOW,

14:30.333 --> 14:32.500
SINCE NEW YORK
DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE
ANYTHING TO DO WITH ME...

14:33.500 --> 14:36.625
JOEY, THAT WAS
A SELF-DEPRECATING ASIDE.

14:36.625 --> 14:37.708
YOU'RE STILL DOING IT.
DOING WHAT?

14:37.708 --> 14:39.667
ACTING WEIRD AROUND ME.

14:39.667 --> 14:41.708
YOU'VE NO REASON
TO NOT BE HAPPY RIGHT NOW.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.458
I KNOW.

14:44.458 --> 14:45.375
HOW'D IT GO WITH MS. WATSON?

14:45.375 --> 14:46.875
PACEY SAID SOMETHING
ABOUT A MIX-UP.

14:46.875 --> 14:48.542
OH, IT WAS NOTHING.
IT WAS...

14:48.542 --> 14:50.542
IT WAS GREAT.

14:50.542 --> 14:51.542
YOU KNOW, I'M GONNA
GO INSIDE

14:51.542 --> 14:52.708
AND SEE IF THEY
NEED ANY HELP,

14:52.708 --> 14:53.542
AND I'LL MEET
YOU GUYS OUT BACK.

14:53.542 --> 14:55.834
SURE THING.

14:59.500 --> 15:02.208
HEY...

15:02.208 --> 15:03.708
HOW'D IT GO?

15:06.375 --> 15:07.875
OH, IT WAS THAT GOOD, HUH?

15:10.041 --> 15:12.333
BESSIE DIDN'T TELL YOU
THE CRUEL IRONY?

15:14.458 --> 15:16.125
THIS PLACE IS MAKING
TOO MUCH MONEY,

15:16.125 --> 15:16.792
SO I'M SCREWED.

15:16.792 --> 15:20.917
WELL, THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

15:20.917 --> 15:23.417
THERE'S GOTTA BE SOMETHING
YOU CAN DO ABOUT THAT.

15:23.417 --> 15:25.542
THERE'S NOTHING
TO BE DONE.

15:25.542 --> 15:27.458
EXCEPT GO OUT THERE
AND CELEBRATE

15:27.458 --> 15:28.250
THIS AMAZING
ACCOMPLISHMENT

15:28.250 --> 15:30.792
THAT I WORKED
SO HARD FOR.

15:30.792 --> 15:32.125
HEY, HOLD ON A SECOND, JO.

15:32.125 --> 15:33.208
WHY?

15:33.208 --> 15:35.375
PACEY, THERE'S NOTHING
THAT YOU CAN SAY OR DO

15:35.375 --> 15:36.417
THAT CAN CHANGE
WHAT HAPPENED.

15:36.417 --> 15:40.083
IT IS WHAT IT IS.
NO ONE CAN CHANGE THAT.

15:40.083 --> 15:41.583
SO, WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA TELL ALL THEM?

15:41.583 --> 15:43.041
NOTHING.

15:43.041 --> 15:45.041
LOOK, I DON'T WANT ANYONE
TO FEEL SORRY FOR ME, OK?

15:52.917 --> 15:53.750
PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION,
COME ON!

15:53.750 --> 15:55.125
ADMIT THAT'S A HUGE PLUS.

15:55.125 --> 15:57.458
YEAH, SPOKEN LIKE
SOMEBODY WHO'S NEVER

15:57.458 --> 15:58.750
BEEN GROPED ON
THE SUBWAY BEFORE.

15:58.750 --> 16:00.041
I HATE NEW YORK.

16:00.041 --> 16:02.333
AH, SPOKEN LIKE
A VERY LOYAL GIRLFRIEND.

16:02.333 --> 16:03.834
OH, THIS IS
UNBELIEVA...HEY!

16:03.834 --> 16:06.625
THE GUEST
OF HONOR.

16:06.625 --> 16:08.333
GET A DRINK.

16:08.333 --> 16:10.041
ALL RIGHT, I'D LIKE
TO PROPOSE A TOAST.

16:10.041 --> 16:11.250
TO JOEY POTTER,

16:11.250 --> 16:13.417
MAY WORTHINGTON
BE WORTHY OF HER.

16:13.417 --> 16:14.625
[LAUGHS]

16:14.625 --> 16:16.291
Dawson: CHEERS.

16:21.250 --> 16:25.291
SO, YOU'RE JUST IN TIME
TO SETTLE THE DEBATE.

16:25.291 --> 16:27.500
OH, NO, NO. I'M NOT GETTING
IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS.

16:27.500 --> 16:28.583
I SHOULD'VE SAID THAT.

16:28.583 --> 16:30.458
UM...I'M GONNA GO
HELP PACEY.

16:30.458 --> 16:31.875
OTHERWISE THE FOOD
WILL STILL BE ALIVE

16:31.875 --> 16:32.959
WHEN HE SERVES IT.

16:32.959 --> 16:34.000
OK. ALL YOU
HAVE TO DO

16:34.000 --> 16:36.458
IS TELL HIM
THAT NEW YORK SUCKS.

16:36.458 --> 16:39.792
NO, HOLD ON. YOU CANNOT
TELL ME THAT NEW YORK SUCKS.

16:39.792 --> 16:42.792
ESPECIALLY AFTER
TELLING ME HOW GREAT
IT IS FOR 2 YEARS.

16:42.792 --> 16:45.000
WELL, IF I'M
TELLING YOU NOW
THAT IT SUCKS,

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
SHOULDN'T YOU
LISTEN TO ME?

16:46.000 --> 16:47.417
YOU KNOW, YOU'VE REALLY
GROWN INSENSITIVE

16:47.417 --> 16:48.792
POST YOUR
COLLEGE ACCEPTANCE.

16:48.792 --> 16:49.750
INSENSITIVE TO WHAT?

16:49.750 --> 16:51.708
TO ME AND MY...
MY...

16:51.708 --> 16:53.834
MY SENSITIVITIES.

16:53.834 --> 16:55.750
SENSITIVITIES?
ARE YOU GUYS CATCHING THIS?

16:55.750 --> 16:58.000
OK, THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT--

16:58.000 --> 16:59.333
MAKING FUN OF ME
IN FRONT OF EVERYBODY.

16:59.333 --> 17:00.375
YOU NEVER USED
TO DO THAT.

17:00.375 --> 17:01.583
YEAH, WELL, YOU NEVER
USED TO ACT

17:01.583 --> 17:02.834
LIKE A LUNATIC, EITHER.

17:02.834 --> 17:04.125
THIS LUNATIC'S GETTING
A BURGER.

17:04.125 --> 17:05.333
YOU DON'T EVEN EAT BURGERS.

17:05.333 --> 17:07.834
I SAID I WAS GONNA
GET IT, NOT EAT IT.

17:12.416 --> 17:13.834
YOU OK?

17:13.834 --> 17:14.750
WITH ALL THIS TALK
ABOUT COLLEGE,

17:14.750 --> 17:16.583
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT FEEL,
WELL...

17:16.583 --> 17:18.250
WELL-DONE?
DON'T WORRY.

17:18.250 --> 17:19.333
I'M VERY AWARE
OF THE HEALTH
HAZARDS

17:19.333 --> 17:21.290
OF COOKING
HAMBURGERS.

17:21.290 --> 17:22.708
YOU'RE NOT GONNA FOOL ME
WITH THAT, PACEY.

17:22.708 --> 17:23.875
WITH WHAT?

17:23.875 --> 17:26.208
WITH THAT PACEY-NESS.

17:26.208 --> 17:28.541
LOOK, I KNOW YOU'RE
HAPPY FOR HER,

17:28.541 --> 17:30.500
BUT IT MAKES
YOU THINK ABOUT
THE FUTURE, RIGHT?

17:30.500 --> 17:32.291
WELL, NO. IT MAKES ME
THINK ABOUT HER FUTURE.

17:32.291 --> 17:33.708
WE DON'T EVEN HAVE
TO THINK ABOUT MY FUTURE,

17:33.708 --> 17:34.875
BECAUSE I DON'T REALLY
HAVE ONE TO THINK OF.

17:34.875 --> 17:36.875
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
THAT BELIEVES THAT,
PACEY,

17:36.875 --> 17:37.917
AND IF YOU KEEP
SAYING IT,

17:37.917 --> 17:39.542
IT'LL HAPPEN.

17:39.542 --> 17:41.291
HAVE YOU THOUGHT
ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE
GONNA DO?

17:41.291 --> 17:43.333
I MEAN, WHAT DO YOU
WANT FOR THE FUTURE?

17:43.333 --> 17:44.500
WHAT DO YOU WANT
FOR THE FUTURE?

17:44.500 --> 17:46.041
SORRY. AS YOUR SISTER,
I RESERVE THE RIGHT

17:46.041 --> 17:48.667
TO PLAY THE
I-ASKED-YOU-FIRST CARD.

17:49.583 --> 17:51.708
HEY, LOOK.
YOU PROMISE NOT TO REPEAT

17:51.708 --> 17:53.458
WHAT I'M ABOUT TO SAY?

17:53.458 --> 17:55.208
YEAH. SURE.
WHAT IS IT?

17:58.000 --> 18:00.959
JOEY'S NOT GOING
TO WORTHINGTON.

18:00.959 --> 18:02.708
THEY DENIED
HER FINANCIAL AID PACKAGE.

18:02.708 --> 18:05.458
SHE'S JUST TOO PROUD
TO TELL ANYBODY ABOUT IT.

18:05.458 --> 18:07.417
THAT'S AWFUL.

18:07.417 --> 18:10.000
YEAH. AND IT GETS
WORSE, ACTUALLY.

18:10.000 --> 18:10.333
HOW CAN IT?

18:12.250 --> 18:14.917
I THINK I'M HAPPY
ABOUT IT.

18:23.583 --> 18:25.291
[SIGHS] OK.

18:26.917 --> 18:29.083
YOU WANNA TELL ME
WHAT THIS IS REALLY ABOUT?

18:29.083 --> 18:30.250
I THINK WE BOTH KNOW
IT'S MORE

18:30.250 --> 18:32.375
THAN MY ALLEGED LACK
OF SENSITIVITY.

18:34.667 --> 18:37.333
YOU KNOW HOW
WHEN YOU MOVED IN
WITH ME AND GRAMS,

18:39.375 --> 18:41.667
YOU SAID THAT YOU
DIDN'T WANT TO GO HOME

18:41.667 --> 18:42.667
BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T
FEEL LIKE

18:42.667 --> 18:44.375
THERE WAS ANYTHING
THERE FOR YOU?

18:44.375 --> 18:44.417
YEAH.

18:46.417 --> 18:50.166
WELL, THAT'S HOW
I FEEL ABOUT NEW YORK.

18:50.166 --> 18:53.041
I KNOW YOU HAVE PROBLEMS
WITH YOUR PARENTS, JEN,

18:53.041 --> 18:54.125
BUT IT'S NOT LIKE
YOU'D BE LIVING WITH THEM.

18:54.125 --> 18:56.166
DON'T LET THAT
STOP YOU FROM GOING.

18:56.166 --> 18:57.458
UHH.

19:01.458 --> 19:03.166
I DON'T KNOW. I WISH
I COULD EXPLAIN THIS TO YOU,

19:03.166 --> 19:07.417
BUT...IT DOESN'T
MAKE ANY SENSE.

19:10.583 --> 19:13.291
I'M AFRAID...

19:16.250 --> 19:18.625
TO GO BACK THERE.

19:18.625 --> 19:21.917
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA
TALK TO FROST ABOUT THIS?

19:21.917 --> 19:24.708
YEAH, HE TRIED.

19:24.708 --> 19:26.959
I JUST CHANGED THE SUBJECT
TO ONE OF MY OTHER NEUROSIS.

19:26.959 --> 19:29.750
WELL, IT'S THERAPY, JEN.

19:29.750 --> 19:30.792
I THINK IT'S LIKE
THE ONE PLACE

19:30.792 --> 19:32.750
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT.

19:32.750 --> 19:35.875
THEN CAN I CHANGE IT
HERE? PLEASE?

19:39.166 --> 19:42.542
IF YOU DON'T WANNA
GO TO NEW YORK,

19:42.542 --> 19:44.166
WE DON'T HAVE
TO GO TO NEW YORK.

19:44.166 --> 19:45.542
JACK...

19:45.542 --> 19:46.667
NO, IT'S MORE IMPORTANT
TO ME

19:46.667 --> 19:49.125
THAT WE GO
TO SCHOOL TOGETHER.

19:49.125 --> 19:50.333
LOOK, WHATEVER
THIS OLD WOUND OF YOURS IS,

19:50.333 --> 19:54.667
I MEAN, DON'T LET IT
STOP US FROM GOING.

19:54.667 --> 19:55.458
YOU'VE COME TOO FAR
FOR THAT.

19:57.625 --> 20:01.125
NOW, BE A GOOD LITTLE
PSYCHOLOGICALLY
DAMAGED CHILD,

20:01.125 --> 20:04.625
GO BACK TO THERAPY,
AND WORK THIS OUT.

20:04.625 --> 20:06.542
SEE? INSENSITIVE.

20:06.542 --> 20:09.333
OH, COME ON.
I'M KIDDING.

20:09.333 --> 20:12.458
HEY, THERE YOU ARE.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

20:12.458 --> 20:13.834
JOEY,
CONGRATULATIONS.

20:13.834 --> 20:15.959
Gale: HONEY, WE ARE
SO HAPPY FOR YOU.

20:15.959 --> 20:17.083
THANK YOU.

20:17.083 --> 20:19.834
AND YOU.

20:22.708 --> 20:24.875
I THINK YOU'VE BEEN
WAITING FOR THIS.

20:29.875 --> 20:31.250
IT CAME.

20:32.750 --> 20:35.458
IT ACTUALLY CAME.

20:37.333 --> 20:38.542
AREN'T YOU GONNA OPEN IT?

20:38.542 --> 20:41.083
YEAH. IT'S...
[NERVOUS LAUGH]

20:41.083 --> 20:43.542
IT'S A...
IT'S A FAT ENVELOPE.

20:43.542 --> 20:44.333
THAT PAINTS A BETTER PICTURE
THAN YESTERDAY, RIGHT?

20:55.583 --> 20:56.583
I'M IN.

20:56.583 --> 20:59.708
[LAUGHING]

20:59.708 --> 21:01.083
I'M IN!

21:01.083 --> 21:02.250
CONGRATULATIONS.

21:02.250 --> 21:03.959
I CAN'T BELIEVE
IT'S HAPPENING!

21:06.417 --> 21:07.708
Gretchen: IT'S WHAT
YOU ALWAYS WANTED.

21:07.708 --> 21:10.959
COME HERE. OHH!

21:10.959 --> 21:13.792
Mitch: WE ARE SO PROUD
OF YOU, SON.

21:16.375 --> 21:17.583
CONGRATULATIONS,
DAWSON.

21:17.583 --> 21:19.083
I'M HAPPY FOR YOU, MAN.

21:19.083 --> 21:20.417
WHERE'S JOEY?

21:27.708 --> 21:29.875
YOU OK?

21:32.250 --> 21:34.291
OH, YEAH. UM...

21:34.291 --> 21:37.041
CONGRATULATIONS.

21:37.041 --> 21:38.542
CONGRATULATIONS?
JO, YOU'RE A WRECK.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.542
IT'S NOTHING. I'M FINE.

21:42.542 --> 21:46.291
JO, WHATEVER IT IS,
YOU CAN TELL ME.

21:46.291 --> 21:47.625
DAWSON, WE'RE HERE
TO CELEBRATE.

21:47.625 --> 21:50.708
YOU GOT INTO U.S.C.
IT'S WHAT YOU'VE
ALWAYS WANTED.

21:50.708 --> 21:52.458
THAT'S RIGHT,
AND WORTHINGTON
IS WHAT YOU ALWAYS WANTED,

21:52.458 --> 21:53.542
SO WHY DON'T YOU
JUST TELL ME WHAT'S WRONG?

21:53.542 --> 21:56.417
DID YOU NOT GET IN?
DID YOU GET WAIT-LISTED?

22:01.500 --> 22:03.125
I DIDN'T GET THE MONEY.

22:05.458 --> 22:07.542
AT LEAST, I DIDN'T
GET ENOUGH OF IT.

22:08.417 --> 22:11.083
I GOT
MY FINANCIAL AID PACKAGE,

22:11.083 --> 22:15.125
AND EVEN WITH GRANTS
AND WORK-STUDY,

22:16.000 --> 22:16.917
THEY STILL WANT $15,000.

22:17.750 --> 22:18.875
$15,000?

22:18.875 --> 22:21.125
THEY THINK
THAT'S WHAT BESSIE
CAN CONTRIBUTE,

22:21.125 --> 22:22.166
WHICH SHE CAN'T,
SO...

22:22.166 --> 22:23.625
JOEY, THERE'S GOT TO BE
A WAY AROUND THIS.

22:23.625 --> 22:25.834
IT'S JUST MONEY.
YOU CAN'T LET THAT STOP YOU

22:25.834 --> 22:28.542
FROM ACHIEVING SOMETHING
YOU'VE WORKED THIS HARD FOR.

22:28.542 --> 22:31.417
YOU MAKE IT SOUND LIKE
THERE'S SOME EASY ANSWER.

22:31.417 --> 22:33.458
THERE'S GOT TO BE.

22:33.458 --> 22:34.542
THERE'S NOT.

22:35.959 --> 22:37.333
I SPENT HOURS
DOING RESEARCH

22:37.333 --> 22:38.875
EVEN BEFORE I APPLIED,

22:38.875 --> 22:40.583
AND GETTING
THE FINANCIAL AID

22:40.583 --> 22:43.708
WAS AS IMPORTANT
AS ME GETTING ACCEPTED.

22:46.041 --> 22:48.000
IT DIDN'T HAPPEN.

22:49.834 --> 22:51.208
JUST DIDN'T.

23:03.500 --> 23:05.041
WORTHINGTON IS
WHAT YOU WANT, RIGHT?

23:07.041 --> 23:08.625
IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT I WANT, DAWSON.

23:08.625 --> 23:10.125
YES OR NO?

23:12.375 --> 23:12.583
YES.

23:18.291 --> 23:20.250
THEN I WANT YOU TO HAVE
MR. BROOKS' MONEY.

23:22.375 --> 23:24.000
DAWSON, ARE YOU INSANE?

23:24.000 --> 23:25.291
I CAN'T--

23:25.291 --> 23:26.875
AT LEAST ENOUGH
TO GET YOU TO SCHOOL.

23:26.875 --> 23:27.917
I KNOW IT SOUNDS CRAZY--

23:27.917 --> 23:29.583
IT'S BEYOND CRAZY.
I MEAN, I APPRECIATE IT,

23:29.583 --> 23:35.458
BUT MR. BROOKS GAVE YOU
THAT MONEY FOR A REASON.

23:35.458 --> 23:36.708
YEAH, HE GAVE ME THAT MONEY
TO DO SOMETHING GREAT,

23:36.708 --> 23:38.208
AND GIVING IT TO YOU
WOULD BE EXACTLY THAT.

23:38.208 --> 23:39.333
I--[LAUGHS]

23:39.333 --> 23:40.625
LOOK, I KNOW
YOU'RE GONNA SAY NO,

23:40.625 --> 23:41.917
AND THAT'S FINE,

23:41.917 --> 23:44.250
BUT DON'T SAY NO
UNTIL YOU'VE AT LEAST

23:44.250 --> 23:45.500
CONSIDERED
THE POSSIBILITY.

23:45.500 --> 23:48.208
JOEY, THIS IS
YOUR ENTIRE FUTURE
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

23:48.208 --> 23:49.625
TAKE A DAY,
TAKE LONGER THAN A DAY,

23:49.625 --> 23:52.583
TAKE WHATEVER YOU NEED,
BUT PROMISE ME

23:52.583 --> 23:54.166
THAT YOU WILL
CONSIDER IT.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.583
THERE ARE
NO PICTURES
OF US IN HERE.

24:28.583 --> 24:29.750
HAVE TO DO SOMETHING
ABOUT THAT.

24:32.875 --> 24:34.166
YEAH.

24:35.500 --> 24:37.291
SO I THOUGHT
ABOUT IT, DAWSON.

24:37.291 --> 24:38.250
I REALLY DID.

24:38.250 --> 24:39.750
AND WHAT DID
YOU DECIDE?

24:39.750 --> 24:41.125
I'D NEVER BE ABLE
TO PAY YOU BACK.

24:42.125 --> 24:42.625
WOULDN'T HAVE TO.

24:42.625 --> 24:44.208
DAWSON, I WOULD.

24:44.208 --> 24:46.458
AND I CAN'T TAKE
THAT MUCH MONEY FROM YOU.

24:46.458 --> 24:47.667
I MEAN, EVEN IF IT WERE
HUNDREDS INSTEAD OF THOUSANDS,

24:47.667 --> 24:52.083
JUST EVEN SAYING IT
MAKES IT SOUND LIKE--

24:52.083 --> 24:52.792
LIKE IT WOULD RUIN
OUR FRIENDSHIP?

24:55.041 --> 24:56.708
YEAH.

24:56.708 --> 25:00.000
JOEY, IF OUR
FRIENDSHIP CAN
SURVIVE LAST SUMMER,

25:00.000 --> 25:01.458
IT CAN
SURVIVE ANYTHING.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.083
NOT THIS.

25:03.083 --> 25:05.250
I CAN'T DO THIS.

25:05.667 --> 25:07.667
[SIGHING]

25:07.667 --> 25:08.750
JOEY, STOP. WAIT.

25:11.000 --> 25:13.625
LOOK, I KNOW HOW MUCH
GOING TO THIS SCHOOL
MEANS TO YOU.

25:13.625 --> 25:14.458
I DON'T WANT
YOU TO THROW AWAY
THIS OPPORTUNITY.

25:14.458 --> 25:16.500
DAWSON,
IT'S TOO MUCH.

25:16.500 --> 25:18.250
CAN'T YOU
UNDERSTAND THAT?

25:18.250 --> 25:19.875
NO.

25:19.875 --> 25:23.708
I CAN'T--I CAN'T
UNDERSTAND WHY YOU JUST
WON'T LET ME HELP YOU, JO.

25:23.708 --> 25:26.291
I MEAN, MAYBE I'M BEING
NAIVE HERE, BUT WE'VE ALWAYS
BEEN THERE FOR EACH OTHER.

25:26.291 --> 25:29.166
THIS IS DIFFERENT.
HOW?

25:29.166 --> 25:31.291
JOEY, I-I'VE WATCHED
YOU GO THROUGH SO MUCH
PAIN IN YOUR LIFE.

25:31.291 --> 25:36.000
I MEAN, EVEN BEFORE
YOUR MOM GOT SICK
AND YOUR DAD...

25:36.000 --> 25:37.083
DON'T DO THIS.

25:37.083 --> 25:39.500
DON'T FEEL SORRY
FOR ME, DAWSON.

25:39.500 --> 25:40.542
I DON'T.
THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.

25:40.542 --> 25:44.250
JO, ALL THE PAIN
I'VE WATCHED YOU GO THROUGH,

25:44.250 --> 25:46.083
I'VE NEVER BEEN ABLE
TO FIX IT BEFORE.

25:47.959 --> 25:50.041
AND THIS I CAN FIX.

25:50.041 --> 25:52.667
ALL I NEED
YOU TO DO IS LET ME.

25:54.625 --> 25:55.625
I CAN'T.

25:55.625 --> 25:57.166
BUT...YOU DON'T EVEN
WANT TO CONSIDER IT?

25:57.166 --> 25:59.208
I HAVE.

25:59.208 --> 26:02.083
JUST LET ME SAY
THANK YOU AND GO.

26:07.792 --> 26:09.834
MOST PEOPLE
DON'T KNOW IT, JEN,

26:09.834 --> 26:11.500
BUT THERAPY WAS
DESIGNED TO INCLUDE

26:11.500 --> 26:13.208
A MINIMUM OF
4 SESSIONS A WEEK.

26:13.208 --> 26:14.917
SO, WHAT DO YOU
WANT TO TALK ABOUT?

26:14.917 --> 26:18.375
UM, I'M READY
TO TALK ABOUT MY DAD

26:18.375 --> 26:20.667
AND, UM,
THE LAST TIME I SAW HIM.

26:24.917 --> 26:26.458
THIS IS GONNA
SOUND REALLY STUPID,

26:26.458 --> 26:30.417
BUT I--I CAN'T REMEMBER
THE LAST CONVERSATION
THAT I HAD WITH HIM.

26:33.375 --> 26:36.000
AND I'M NOT SURE WHY,
BUT I FEEL LIKE I'M GONNA CRY.

26:36.000 --> 26:37.500
I KNOW
IT'S DIFFICULT,

26:37.500 --> 26:39.250
BUT THE KEY
IS TO KEEP TALKING
ABOUT IT.

26:39.250 --> 26:40.750
BUT IF I CAN'T
REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED,

26:40.750 --> 26:43.291
HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO TALK ABOUT IT?

26:43.291 --> 26:45.291
WHY DON'T WE TRY
ANOTHER APPROACH.

26:46.417 --> 26:47.917
WAS THERE
SOMEONE ELSE THERE

26:47.917 --> 26:50.083
WHO COULD TELL YOU
WHAT HAPPENED?

26:50.083 --> 26:51.625
LIKE MY MOM?
YES.

26:51.625 --> 26:52.166
OR YOUR
OLD BOYFRIEND.

26:52.166 --> 26:56.750
MMM...

26:56.750 --> 26:57.750
THEN PERHAPS
YOU SPEND TIME
WITH SOMEONE ELSE

26:57.750 --> 26:58.792
WHO COULD HELP
FILL IN THE BLANKS.

27:07.625 --> 27:08.542
HEY, MAN.

27:08.542 --> 27:09.583
YOU JUST
MISSED GRETCHEN.

27:09.583 --> 27:10.750
ACTUALLY,
IT'S YOU I WANT
TO TALK TO.

27:13.000 --> 27:14.208
OK.

27:17.959 --> 27:19.166
JOEY TOLD YOU, RIGHT?

27:19.166 --> 27:20.875
ABOUT THE MONEY?

27:20.875 --> 27:21.834
YEP.

27:24.542 --> 27:26.458
SO WHAT DO
YOU THINK?

27:26.458 --> 27:28.667
I THINK THAT $15,000
IS A LOT OF MONEY

27:28.667 --> 27:30.458
TO GIVE SOMEBODY
WITH NO STRINGS ATTACHED.

27:30.458 --> 27:31.750
SHE DESERVES TO GO
TO WORTHINGTON, PACE.

27:31.750 --> 27:33.959
YOU KNOW THAT AS WELL
AS ANYONE ELSE.

27:33.959 --> 27:34.959
SHE DESERVES
MORE THAN...

27:34.959 --> 27:37.500
WHAT?
MORE THAN ME?

27:37.500 --> 27:38.875
THAT'S NOT
WHAT I SAID,

27:38.875 --> 27:40.583
AND IT'S NOT
WHAT I MEANT.

27:40.583 --> 27:40.959
PACE...

27:43.875 --> 27:45.458
SHE'S BEEN FIGHTING

27:45.458 --> 27:46.583
FOR A SCHOOL
LIKE WORTHINGTON

27:46.583 --> 27:48.500
SINCE THE SECOND
WE GOT INTO
HIGH SCHOOL...

27:48.500 --> 27:50.917
AGAINST
ENORMOUS ODDS,

27:50.917 --> 27:52.625
AGAINST PEOPLE
WHO HAVE BEEN
WRITING HER OFF

27:52.625 --> 27:53.250
SIMPLY BECAUSE
OF HER FATHER,

27:53.250 --> 27:55.792
AND SHE DID IT.

27:55.792 --> 27:58.458
I MEAN,
SHE BEAT THE ODDS.
SHE GOT IN.

27:58.458 --> 28:00.333
AND I CAN'T
STAND TO SIT BACK

28:00.333 --> 28:01.333
AND WATCH
HER LOSE IT ALL

28:01.333 --> 28:02.959
OVER SOMETHING
AS STUPID AS MONEY.

28:02.959 --> 28:07.333
AND I DON'T THINK
YOU CAN, EITHER.

28:07.333 --> 28:09.917
CAN YOU SEE
HER BEING HAPPY
ANYPLACE ELSE?

28:11.834 --> 28:14.667
NO, I CAN'T.

28:21.000 --> 28:21.959
[DEEP SIGH]

28:24.125 --> 28:25.667
HEY, THERE.

28:26.708 --> 28:28.917
TO WHAT DO I OWE
THIS DISPLEASURE?

28:30.834 --> 28:32.625
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU,
CAPTAIN A-HOLE.

28:32.625 --> 28:33.542
OVER HERE.

28:33.542 --> 28:35.708
WELL, THIS CAN'T
BE A SOCIAL CALL,

28:35.708 --> 28:38.208
SINCE WE'VE BARELY
SPOKEN IN MONTHS,

28:38.208 --> 28:39.792
WHICH, BY THE WAY,
HAS BEEN DAMAGING
TO MY EGO.

28:39.792 --> 28:44.041
GOD, YOU ARE GONNA
MAKE THIS SO HARD.

28:44.041 --> 28:47.917
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT YOU AND I ACTUALLY
USED TO BE FRIENDS.

28:47.917 --> 28:49.041
WELL, YOU KNOW,
WE WERE FRIENDS

28:49.041 --> 28:50.417
BECAUSE WE WERE
A LOT ALIKE.

28:50.417 --> 28:52.625
WE BOTH HAD
AN INTENSE DESIRE
TO FEEL NOTHING.

28:52.625 --> 28:53.542
THAT'S REALLY NICE.

28:53.542 --> 28:56.125
LOOK, I GOTTA
ASK YOU A QUESTION,

28:56.125 --> 28:58.333
AND FOR ONCE
IN YOUR LIFE,

28:58.333 --> 28:59.875
I NEED YOU
TO TAKE ME SERIOUSLY.

28:59.875 --> 29:01.542
YEAH. I'LL SEE
WHAT I CAN DO.

29:01.542 --> 29:03.000
WHAT HAPPENED
THE LAST NIGHT

29:03.000 --> 29:04.625
THAT WE WERE
TOGETHER IN NEW YORK?

29:04.625 --> 29:06.875
HA HA!

29:06.875 --> 29:09.583
YOU DON'T REMEMBER?

29:11.417 --> 29:13.083
YOU DON'T, DO YOU.

29:13.083 --> 29:14.333
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

29:14.333 --> 29:15.708
HMM.

29:15.708 --> 29:20.000
WELL, YOU INVITED
ME OVER BECAUSE

29:20.000 --> 29:23.250
YOUR HORRIBLE
PARENTS WERE
SENDING YOU AWAY.

29:23.250 --> 29:24.917
WE BEGAN
AT MY PLACE,

29:24.917 --> 29:28.208
WHERE WE EMPTIED
OUT MY POP'S
LIQUOR CABINET.

29:28.208 --> 29:31.250
THEN WE PICKED UP
SOME GOOD STUFF
IN WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK

29:31.250 --> 29:34.750
BEFORE HEADING BACK
TO YOUR DELUXE APARTMENT
IN THE SKY.

29:34.750 --> 29:36.250
NOW, IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY,

29:36.250 --> 29:38.750
WE GOT PARTICULARLY
COMFY ON THE SOFA,

29:38.750 --> 29:39.708
HEARD KEYS IN THE DOOR,
AND HID IN YOUR ROOM,

29:39.708 --> 29:42.750
WHERE YOU CONTINUED
TO RAVAGE ME.

29:42.750 --> 29:45.208
IT WAS QUITE
MIND-BLOWING.

29:45.208 --> 29:47.083
ESPECIALLY THE PART
WHEN YOUR MOTHER
WALKED IN AND JOINED US.

29:47.083 --> 29:47.917
YOU'RE REPULSIVE,
YOU KNOW THAT?

29:47.917 --> 29:50.875
WHY ARE
YOU DOING THIS?

29:50.875 --> 29:51.917
WHY ARE YOU?

29:51.917 --> 29:53.917
THE PAST IS PAST, LINDLEY.
JUST LET IT BE.

29:53.917 --> 29:54.834
WELL, I'D LIKE TO,
ALL RIGHT,
BUT I CAN'T.

29:54.834 --> 29:57.625
I JUST NEED TO KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED.

29:57.625 --> 29:58.792
WON'T YOU PLEASE
TELL ME?

29:58.792 --> 29:59.625
YOU KNOW WHAT?

29:59.625 --> 30:01.333
I HAVEN'T
WORKED THROUGH IT YET.

30:01.333 --> 30:03.458
[DEEP SIGH]

30:03.458 --> 30:05.083
YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT
THAT MAYBE JUST ONCE

30:05.083 --> 30:06.875
YOU'D BE ABLE
TO HELP ME OUT HERE.

30:09.125 --> 30:09.667
I GUESS I WAS WRONG.

30:09.667 --> 30:11.792
HEY, IT HAPPENS.

30:30.625 --> 30:34.708
I COULD STILL
SELL A KIDNEY.

30:34.708 --> 30:36.708
THIS ISN'T
A JOKE, PACEY.

30:36.708 --> 30:37.125
I KNOW THAT.

30:39.291 --> 30:42.917
I WAS THINKING THAT,
UH, YOU KNOW,

30:42.917 --> 30:45.667
MAYBE I'LL STAY
HERE ANOTHER YEAR,
AND THEN, YOU KNOW,

30:45.667 --> 30:48.166
I CAN DECLARE
MYSELF FINANCIALLY
INDEPENDENT,

30:48.166 --> 30:49.500
AND THEN I CAN
REAPPLY.

30:49.500 --> 30:51.333
NO, YOU'RE NOT
STAYING ANOTHER YEAR.

30:51.333 --> 30:53.166
IT'S JUST A YEAR.

30:53.166 --> 30:55.500
NO, IT'S NOT.

30:55.500 --> 30:56.875
IT NEVER IS,

30:56.875 --> 30:58.834
ESPECIALLY NOT
IN A TOWN LIKE THIS.

30:58.834 --> 31:00.959
THE WEEKS BECOME MONTHS.
THE MONTHS BECOME YEARS.

31:00.959 --> 31:02.667
THE YEARS BECOME DECADES.

31:02.667 --> 31:05.041
PRETTY SOON, YOU'VE LIVED
A FRACTION OF THE LIFE
THAT YOU WERE MEANT TO.

31:06.000 --> 31:07.542
THAT'S NOT GONNA
HAPPEN TO YOU, JOEY.

31:07.542 --> 31:09.917
YOU DON'T WANT IT TO.

31:09.917 --> 31:12.000
I DON'T WANT IT TO.

31:12.000 --> 31:13.959
AND DAWSON DOESN'T
WANT IT TO, EITHER.

31:21.917 --> 31:23.125
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

31:23.125 --> 31:23.458
CAN I COME IN?

31:23.458 --> 31:25.333
NO.

31:28.208 --> 31:30.291
YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE NOT GONNA MAKE THIS
EASY FOR ME, ARE YOU?

31:31.583 --> 31:34.166
I'M TRYING TO APOLOGIZE

31:34.166 --> 31:36.083
AND TELL YOU THE TRUTH, OK?

31:36.083 --> 31:38.208
THE TRUTH ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED THAT NIGHT,

31:38.208 --> 31:39.542
SINCE IT MEANS
SO MUCH TO YOU.

31:39.542 --> 31:40.917
I'M LISTENING.

31:40.917 --> 31:45.417
THE TRUTH IS,
YOU WERE REALLY
WASTED THAT DAY,

31:45.417 --> 31:51.041
AND WHEN YOU BROUGHT
ME BACK TO YOUR PLACE,
I WAS SHOCKED.

31:51.041 --> 31:52.708
I MEAN, YOU TOLD ME ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED WITH BILLY

31:52.708 --> 31:54.208
AND HOW YOU GUYS
GOT CAUGHT,

31:54.208 --> 31:56.208
BUT YOU STILL
BROUGHT ME HOME.

31:56.208 --> 31:58.708
WE SAT ON THE SOFA,

31:58.708 --> 32:02.750
WHERE YOU WAITED FOR ME
TO CLUMSILY MAKE A MOVE.

32:02.750 --> 32:04.250
YOU KNEW
I KIND OF LIKED YOU,

32:04.250 --> 32:11.041
BUT, UM, YOU REALLY DIDN'T
SEEM THAT INTO IT. WHATEVER.

32:12.750 --> 32:14.458
WE DIDN'T GET VERY FAR
BEFORE YOUR PARENTS CAME HOME.

32:14.458 --> 32:16.667
AND MY DAD?

32:16.667 --> 32:20.291
YOUR DAD...

32:20.291 --> 32:22.208
YOUR DAD WAS FURIOUS.

32:22.208 --> 32:24.041
YOU GUYS JUST
STARTED GOING AT IT.

32:24.041 --> 32:25.625
HE CALLED YOU A SLUT.

32:25.625 --> 32:27.250
YOU CALLED HIM A HYPOCRITE.

32:27.250 --> 32:30.583
JUST AS IT STARTED GETTING
INTERESTING, HE TOSSED MY ASS.

32:30.583 --> 32:32.542
SO THAT'S IT.
YOU DON'T KNOW

32:32.542 --> 32:33.458
WHAT ELSE WE WERE
FIGHTING ABOUT?

32:33.458 --> 32:34.917
NO.

32:34.917 --> 32:37.834
BUT YOU MADE IT
PERFECTLY CLEAR
THAT IT WASN'T ABOUT US.

32:37.834 --> 32:42.208
NOTHING THAT NIGHT
WAS ABOUT US.

32:43.208 --> 32:46.250
I USED YOU
TO PROVOKE HIM,
DIDN'T I?

32:46.250 --> 32:49.125
[DEEP SIGH]

32:49.125 --> 32:50.875
OH, GOD. THAT'S
WHY I DIDN'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

32:53.458 --> 32:54.750
NO WORRIES.

32:54.750 --> 32:56.625
I JUST FIGURED YOU WERE
A LESBIAN OR SOMETHING.

32:56.625 --> 32:57.834
HEH HEH!

32:57.834 --> 33:00.000
I WISH.

33:00.000 --> 33:02.166
DRUE, I'M SORRY.

33:02.166 --> 33:04.125
I'M REAL SORRY
I USED YOU.

33:07.834 --> 33:09.708
APOLOGY ACCEPTED.

33:26.000 --> 33:27.500
HOW LONG HAVE YOU
BEEN STANDING THERE?

33:30.458 --> 33:31.417
NOT LONG.

33:33.500 --> 33:35.500
[DEEP SIGH]

33:35.500 --> 33:36.500
FROM THE LOOK
ON YOUR FACE,

33:36.500 --> 33:37.500
I TAKE IT
PACEY COULDN'T
CONVINCE YOU.

33:37.500 --> 33:40.250
DAWSON,
I HAVE TO TELL
YOU SOMETHING,

33:40.250 --> 33:42.250
AND I DON'T
KNOW IF I CAN.

33:42.250 --> 33:43.875
NO, PLEASE...

33:43.875 --> 33:46.375
DON'T MAKE THIS HARDER.

33:46.375 --> 33:48.458
DON'T MAKE
WHAT  HARDER?

33:48.458 --> 33:50.834
TELLING YOU THE TRUTH.

33:50.834 --> 33:54.458
THE NIGHT THAT I RAN
INTO YOU AT THE MOVIES,

33:54.458 --> 33:57.166
I WAS TRYING TO MAKE
SENSE OF THINGS, TOO,

33:57.166 --> 34:02.250
AND WHEN YOU ASKED ME
THAT VERY PERSONAL QUESTION,

34:02.250 --> 34:05.708
YOU WERE RIGHT.

34:05.708 --> 34:09.208
I SLEPT WITH PACEY
OVER THE SKI TRIP.

34:11.208 --> 34:13.041
I WANTED TO TELL YOU
THE TRUTH, DAWSON,

34:13.041 --> 34:20.041
BUT AFTER ALL THE TIME
WE SPENT TOGETHER JUST
WALKING AND TALKING, I MEAN...

34:20.041 --> 34:23.083
IT'S LIKE THINGS
ARE RIGHT BETWEEN US AGAIN,

34:23.083 --> 34:26.250
AND IT'S BETTER THAN I EVER
THOUGHT IT EVER COULD BE.

34:26.250 --> 34:32.291
SO WHEN YOU ASKED
ME THAT QUESTION...

34:32.291 --> 34:36.041
I DON'T KNOW. I THOUGHT
THAT YOU WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND.

34:36.041 --> 34:38.291
SO YOU NEVER
GAVE ME A CHANCE
TO UNDERSTAND?

34:40.417 --> 34:43.375
I KNOW I SHOULD HAVE
TOLD YOU THE TRUTH, DAWSON.

34:43.375 --> 34:46.250
I KNOW IT WASN'T
FAIR OF ME TO LET
YOU GO ON THINKING

34:46.250 --> 34:48.792
THAT THINGS WERE
STILL THE SAME, THAT...

34:48.792 --> 34:51.208
THAT I WAS
THE MOST IMPORTANT
PERSON IN YOUR LIFE.

34:55.750 --> 34:58.959
ALL I CAN SAY IS
I NEVER WANTED TO HURT YOU.

34:59.583 --> 35:00.792
HEH.

35:06.708 --> 35:08.208
I GUESS I SHOULD GO.

35:21.125 --> 35:22.458
AND SO THAT'S IT.

35:22.458 --> 35:25.875
I MEAN, AFTER ALL
MY TALKING AND
SLEUTHING AND CRYING,

35:25.875 --> 35:27.417
ALL THAT I REMEMBER
IS THAT THE LAST TIME

35:27.417 --> 35:28.917
THAT I SAW
MY FATHER, WE HAD
A REALLY BIG FIGHT.

35:28.917 --> 35:30.625
WHICH,
GIVEN OUR HISTORY,

35:30.625 --> 35:31.959
IS ABOUT AS OBVIOUS
AS IT IS PREDICTABLE,

35:31.959 --> 35:34.750
AND I STILL DON'T
EVEN KNOW WHAT WE WERE
FIGHTING ABOUT.

35:34.750 --> 35:38.542
I MEAN, WAS IT JUST
BECAUSE I WAS BEING
SENT AWAY?

35:38.542 --> 35:40.125
YOU'RE NOT READY
TO FIND OUT.

35:40.125 --> 35:41.875
WHEN YOU'RE READY,
IT'LL COME TO YOU.

35:41.875 --> 35:43.166
YOU'RE A REAL
FONT OF WISDOM TODAY.

35:43.166 --> 35:46.875
THESE THINGS
TAKE TIME, JEN.

35:46.875 --> 35:48.500
WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN I DO REMEMBER?

35:48.500 --> 35:49.291
I MEAN,
IF I REMEMBER.

35:49.291 --> 35:52.458
WHAT DO
YOU THINK HAPPENS?

35:52.458 --> 35:54.250
I SUPPOSE I'LL
HAVE YET ANOTHER

35:54.250 --> 35:55.875
SPECIFIC REASON
TO HATE MY PARENTS.

35:55.875 --> 35:59.667
DO YOU THINK YOU'RE HERE
TO ACCUMULATE REASONS
TO HATE YOUR PARENTS?

35:59.667 --> 36:00.667
NO.

36:00.667 --> 36:01.959
SO?

36:01.959 --> 36:05.750
SO I'M HERE
TO STOP HATING THEM?

36:05.750 --> 36:07.417
CLOSER.

36:07.417 --> 36:08.625
OH, I DON'T KNOW.

36:08.625 --> 36:10.166
DOC,
GIVE ME A BREAK.

36:10.166 --> 36:12.166
ONE OF US
IN THIS ROOM HAS
A DEGREE IN THIS.

36:12.166 --> 36:16.166
YOU'RE HERE
TO STOP HATING YOURSELF.

36:16.166 --> 36:20.000
SEE, WHEN YOU ACT OUT
AT THE AGE THAT YOU DID,

36:20.000 --> 36:22.125
WHEN YOU HAVE SEX
IN YOUR PARENT'S BED
AT 12 YEARS OLD,

36:22.125 --> 36:26.333
WHEN YOU ABUSE LIQUOR
AND DRUGS BEFORE YOU'RE
EVEN OLD ENOUGH TO DRIVE,

36:26.333 --> 36:28.875
YES, YOU'RE DOING IT
AS A CRY FOR LOVE.

36:28.875 --> 36:33.667
YES, YOU'RE DOING IT
BECAUSE SOMETHING ROBBED
YOU OF YOUR CHILDHOOD

36:33.667 --> 36:35.208
IN A WAY THAT YOU'LL
BE ANGRY ABOUT
FOR A LONG TIME.

36:35.208 --> 36:37.875
BUT THE REASON
YOU KEEP ACTING OUT,

36:37.875 --> 36:40.667
THE REASON YOU'VE STAYED
ON A SELF-DESTRUCTIVE PATH

36:40.667 --> 36:44.917
IS NOT BECAUSE
YOU BLAME YOUR FATHER
FOR WHAT HAPPENED.

36:44.917 --> 36:46.875
IT'S BECAUSE
YOU BLAME YOURSELF.

36:46.875 --> 36:48.834
THAT'S WHY YOU DON'T
WANT TO REMEMBER.

36:48.834 --> 36:50.166
AS LONG AS YOU DON'T,
YOU'LL KEEP TELLING YOURSELF

36:50.166 --> 36:54.667
THAT WHATEVER HAPPENED
IS YOUR FAULT,

36:54.667 --> 36:56.041
AND YOU'LL KEEP ACTING OUT,

36:56.041 --> 36:58.250
AND YOU'LL KEEP
ROBBING YOURSELF
OF LIFE'S GREATEST MOMENTS

36:58.250 --> 37:00.834
UNTIL YOU PROVE
YOURSELF RIGHT.

37:00.834 --> 37:03.375
BUT YOU'RE WRONG.

37:03.375 --> 37:10.792
JENNIFER, YOU ARE A BEAUTIFUL,
INNOCENT YOUNG WOMAN

37:10.792 --> 37:12.542
WHO'S MEANT
TO SHINE IN THIS WORLD

37:12.542 --> 37:16.041
IN WAYS YOU CAN'T
EVEN BEGIN TO FATHOM.

37:16.041 --> 37:18.500
AND I'M HERE
TO HELP YOU SEE THAT.

37:22.458 --> 37:27.041
SO, CAN I KEEP COMING,
LIKE, 4 TIMES A WEEK?

37:27.041 --> 37:28.291
HA HA HA!

38:00.250 --> 38:02.166
SO, ARE WE GOING
TO WORTHINGTON?

38:03.291 --> 38:03.500
NO.

38:05.375 --> 38:07.750
BUT YOU DID GO
AND TALK TO DAWSON.

38:10.917 --> 38:13.083
YEAH.

38:13.083 --> 38:14.959
I HAD TO TELL
HIM SOMETHING

38:14.959 --> 38:16.959
THAT I SHOULD HAVE
TOLD HIM A LONG TIME
AGO, PACE.

38:16.959 --> 38:20.250
SOMETHING ABOUT US?

38:21.375 --> 38:24.291
SOMETHING ABOUT
US AND SEX?

38:24.291 --> 38:27.333
I DON'T KNOW
WHY I LIED, PACE,

38:27.333 --> 38:28.500
BUT I DID.

38:30.959 --> 38:33.041
IT'S OK.

38:33.041 --> 38:36.625
YOU TOLD HIM THE TRUTH NOW.
THAT'S WHAT'S IMPORTANT.

38:37.708 --> 38:40.333
AND AS LONG AS WE'RE
IN THE SEASON OF HONESTY,

38:40.333 --> 38:43.500
THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE THAT
I PROBABLY OUGHT TO OFFER UP.

38:43.500 --> 38:45.166
WHAT'S THAT?

38:45.959 --> 38:47.917
WELL...

38:49.667 --> 38:51.750
AS HAPPY AS I WAS
FOR YOU WHEN I FOUND OUT

38:51.750 --> 38:53.250
THAT YOU WERE
GOING TO WORTHINGTON,

38:53.250 --> 38:56.750
I THINK THAT I WAS...

38:56.750 --> 39:00.041
JUST AS HAPPY
WHEN I FOUND OUT
THAT YOU WEREN'T.

39:01.834 --> 39:03.875
IT'S NOT THAT I DON'T WANT
YOU TO BE ABLE TO GO OFF

39:03.875 --> 39:05.125
AND REALIZE
YOUR DREAMS, JOEY,

39:05.125 --> 39:06.166
BECAUSE I DO.

39:06.166 --> 39:09.667
BUT FOR THE FIRST TIME,
I JUST--I FELT LIKE

39:09.667 --> 39:10.542
IT WASN'T ME THAT WAS
HOLDING YOU BACK FROM IT.

39:10.542 --> 39:13.500
PACEY, YOU'VE
NEVER HELD ME BACK.

39:13.500 --> 39:15.500
YOU HAVE TO STOP
THINKING LIKE THAT.

39:15.500 --> 39:17.500
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I COULD STOP THINKING LIKE THAT

39:17.500 --> 39:19.583
IF YOU'D JUST
PROMISE ME ONE THING,

39:19.583 --> 39:21.834
THAT IF THE DAY EVER COMES,

39:21.834 --> 39:24.667
AND IT MAY COME MUCH SOONER
THAN EITHER ONE OF US THINKS,

39:24.667 --> 39:30.458
BUT IF THAT DAY EVER COMES
WHERE YOU DID FEEL LIKE
I WAS HOLDING YOU BACK...

39:30.458 --> 39:32.750
PROMISE ME THAT YOU'D
CUT ME LOOSE, YEAH?

39:32.750 --> 39:34.041
PACEY.

39:34.041 --> 39:35.291
PROMISE ME THAT.

39:35.291 --> 39:36.959
I WON'T
PROMISE YOU THAT.

39:36.959 --> 39:39.625
YOU'RE ASKING ME
TO PROMISE
TO LET YOU GO.

39:43.500 --> 39:45.792
I CAN'T DO THAT.

39:53.875 --> 39:55.708
EXACTLY WHAT IS IT
WE'RE DOING, AGAIN?

39:55.708 --> 39:57.333
I TOLD YOU.
A MEMORY EXERCISE.

39:57.333 --> 39:59.375
AND WHY ARE
WE DOING THIS?

39:59.375 --> 40:01.875
MY SHRINK
RECOMMENDED IT.

40:02.708 --> 40:04.458
IT'S KIND OF LIKE
SELF-HYPNOSIS.

40:04.458 --> 40:07.333
SUPPOSEDLY, IF YOU
STARE AT THE FISH

40:07.333 --> 40:10.083
FOR A HALF-HOUR OR SO,
IT WILL HELP YOU
REMEMBER THINGS.

40:10.083 --> 40:12.375
IT'S MY HOPE
THAT BY STARING AT THIS FISH,

40:12.375 --> 40:15.000
IT'LL HELP ME RECALL
WHY I'M SO ANGRY AT MY FATHER,

40:15.000 --> 40:17.792
THUS ALLOWING ME
TO FORGIVE BOTH HE AND MYSELF

40:17.792 --> 40:20.417
AND ENABLING US TO GO
TO SCHOOL IN NEW YORK CITY

40:20.417 --> 40:22.291
IF IN FACT THAT'S
WHERE WE DESIRE TO ATTEND.

40:22.291 --> 40:23.834
I SEE.

40:25.083 --> 40:27.750
NOT FOR NOTHING,
JEN, BUT, UM...

40:27.750 --> 40:29.583
IT'S ONLY SINCE
YOU STARTED SEEING
THIS PSYCHOLOGIST

40:29.583 --> 40:30.834
THAT I'M
STARTING TO THINK

40:30.834 --> 40:33.917
THAT YOU MAY
IN FACT BE CRAZY.

40:33.917 --> 40:36.792
JACK, DO YOU WANT
TO GO TO SCHOOL
IN NEW YORK?

40:36.792 --> 40:37.959
YEAH.

40:37.959 --> 40:40.000
SHUT UP.
WATCH THE FISH.

40:52.166 --> 40:53.625
DAWSON?

40:57.083 --> 40:58.375
HEY.

40:58.375 --> 40:59.792
HEY.

40:59.792 --> 41:01.333
BESSIE TOLD ME
I COULD WAIT
OUT HERE.

41:01.333 --> 41:02.542
I HOPE IT'S OK.

41:02.542 --> 41:05.875
YEAH, I'M JUST
A LITTLE SURPRISED,
CONSIDERING...

41:05.875 --> 41:08.291
I THINK YOU
UNDERESTIMATE ME.

41:09.667 --> 41:11.792
I THINK
WE UNDERESTIMATE
EACH OTHER.

41:13.959 --> 41:16.750
WHAT I'M TRYING
TO SAY, JOEY,
IS THAT...

41:19.959 --> 41:21.125
WHAT YOU FELT
THE OTHER NIGHT AT
THE MOVIE THEATER,

41:21.125 --> 41:24.417
THAT SOMETHING WAS
FINALLY RIGHT
BETWEEN US...

41:26.166 --> 41:27.917
I FELT THAT, TOO.

41:29.708 --> 41:31.667
AND NOTHING WILL
EVER CHANGE THAT--

41:31.667 --> 41:33.542
NOT GOING TO SCHOOL
ON DIFFERENT COASTS.

41:33.542 --> 41:35.166
NOT MEETING PEOPLE
WHO WE'RE MEANT
TO LOVE FOREVER--

41:35.166 --> 41:37.792
NOTHING.

41:37.792 --> 41:40.083
AND I WANT YOU
TO HAVE THIS.

41:42.083 --> 41:43.667
BUT, DAWSON--

41:43.667 --> 41:45.000
I DON'T KNOW
HOW I FEEL

41:45.000 --> 41:46.667
ABOUT YOU SLEEPING
WITH PACEY.

41:46.667 --> 41:48.792
I DON'T KNOW HOW
I'LL FEEL TOMORROW

41:48.792 --> 41:50.625
OR NEXT WEEK
OR NEXT YEAR
FOR THAT MATTER,

41:50.625 --> 41:53.792
BUT I'M
ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN

41:53.792 --> 41:56.792
THAT GIVING YOU THIS
IS THE RIGHT THING
TO DO.

41:58.875 --> 42:00.583
BECAUSE I'M
CERTAIN ABOUT US...

42:00.583 --> 42:03.417
AND WHAT WE MEAN
TO EACH OTHER.

42:06.834 --> 42:08.792
AND I THINK
YOU ARE, TOO.

42:18.000 --> 42:20.458
THANK YOU.

42:29.708 --> 42:32.500
YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE SOME OF
THE BEST YEARS

42:32.500 --> 42:33.667
OF YOUR LIFE
AT WORTHINGTON.

42:37.417 --> 42:38.417
AND I WANT TO HEAR
ALL ABOUT 'EM.
