Governor Pryce,
I've so wanted
to meet you.

20:34.120 --> 20:36.670
Such a small victory.

20:46.250 --> 20:48.790
I hope this hatch
isn't locked.

20:48.790 --> 20:51.170
Come on.
Let's get you out of here.

20:51.170 --> 20:52.250
Kanan.

(CHOPPER GRUNTING)

20:59.500 --> 21:02.080
I know she did, Chop.
I know.

21:02.080 --> 21:04.170
Kanan, I'm so sorry.

21:05.960 --> 21:07.250
It's all right, Mart.

21:07.250 --> 21:09.210
There's nothing
you could have done.

21:09.210 --> 21:11.040
But there is something
I can do.

21:23.790 --> 21:26.540
