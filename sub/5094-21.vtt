WEBVTT

00:08.061 --> 00:09.495
Isn't this place charming?

00:09.497 --> 00:10.797
As advertised,

00:10.799 --> 00:13.399
but you didn't invite me here
for the charm

00:13.401 --> 00:15.334
or the ice cream.

00:15.336 --> 00:16.602
We can't just have ice cream?

00:16.604 --> 00:17.703
We can,

00:17.705 --> 00:19.438
but not in this instance.

00:19.440 --> 00:21.374
Better chance of being hit
by lightning.

00:21.376 --> 00:23.075
(chuckles)

00:23.077 --> 00:24.944
Okay, I have a problem.

00:24.946 --> 00:26.579
Well,

00:26.581 --> 00:29.315
first of all, your mom's got
a lot on her plate,

00:29.317 --> 00:32.250
and I think she's doing an
outstanding job considering...

00:32.253 --> 00:33.386
It's not about Mom.

00:33.388 --> 00:35.154
Oh.

00:35.156 --> 00:37.356
It's about my teacher.

00:37.358 --> 00:39.425
(phone rings) It's like she's made it
her mission in life

00:39.427 --> 00:41.260
to keep me from ever graduating.

00:41.262 --> 00:42.795
Turn that thing off.

00:42.797 --> 00:44.430
But what if it's important?

00:44.432 --> 00:45.832
Choose.

00:47.668 --> 00:49.836
Look, here's the problem.

00:49.838 --> 00:52.371
She's notorious for being harder
on the girls,

00:52.373 --> 00:54.707
but when she found out
I was from a family of cops...

00:54.709 --> 00:56.008
Look, I should really check it.

00:56.010 --> 00:57.577
Choose.

00:57.579 --> 00:58.945
(door opens, bell dings)

00:58.947 --> 01:00.179
Grandpa...

01:00.181 --> 01:02.782
How would you feel if I was
constantly interrupting?

01:02.784 --> 01:05.318
Deputy Commissioner Moore
just walked in.

01:05.319 --> 01:07.520
(bell dings)

01:11.625 --> 01:13.826
Hold that thought.

01:18.699 --> 01:20.867
A cop's been shot.

01:22.970 --> 01:24.737
(sighs)
Who and where?

01:24.739 --> 01:26.272
North End bus yard,

01:26.274 --> 01:27.673
multiple precincts rolled,

01:27.675 --> 01:29.876
but radio chatter's not clear
on a name,

01:29.878 --> 01:31.510
how bad they're hit.

01:31.512 --> 01:33.179
We've got conflicting
descriptions

01:33.181 --> 01:35.114
of perps and
direction of flight.

01:35.116 --> 01:38.150
Tell me something we do know.

01:38.152 --> 01:39.819
Whoever's down

01:39.821 --> 01:42.588
is a detective
out of Danny's precinct.

01:43.423 --> 01:44.957
(sighs)

01:44.959 --> 01:46.893
DANNY:
<i>This is Detective Reagan.</i>

01:46.895 --> 01:48.194
Leave a message.

01:48.196 --> 01:49.462
Hey, Danny, it's me;
give me a call.

01:49.464 --> 01:50.730
Let me know everything's okay.

01:50.732 --> 01:53.432
Hey, voice mail again?

01:53.434 --> 01:55.167
Yeah, third time.
You heard anything new?

01:55.169 --> 01:56.602
Lady called 911,

01:56.604 --> 01:58.170
said she was out
walking her dog,

01:58.172 --> 01:59.672
heard yelling
from behind a fence.

01:59.674 --> 02:02.108
Someone being accused
of being a cop.

02:02.110 --> 02:03.309
Shots fired.

02:03.311 --> 02:04.477
There's still no name?

02:04.479 --> 02:06.312
Only that he was rushed
to St. Benjamin's.

02:06.314 --> 02:07.813
A couple of guys
are headed over.

02:07.815 --> 02:09.315
All right, I'm gonna ask
the boss if we can, too,

02:09.317 --> 02:11.117
just in case, all right?
Okay, come on,

02:11.119 --> 02:13.419
there's got to be 15
detectives in the 5-4 squad.

02:13.421 --> 02:15.655
(phone ringing)
Odds are it isn't your brother.

02:15.657 --> 02:17.123
Danny's wife.

02:17.125 --> 02:18.624
No way she's heard anything.

02:18.626 --> 02:20.259
Unless she got the call.

02:20.261 --> 02:21.460
Hey, Linda.

02:21.462 --> 02:23.930
Jamie, it's not Danny.

02:23.932 --> 02:25.564
He called you?

02:25.566 --> 02:27.266
Yeah, in case I heard,
but he's fine.

02:27.268 --> 02:29.302
He's working a case
in Murray Hill,

02:29.304 --> 02:30.670
and he said he was gonna
call your dad

02:30.672 --> 02:31.938
as soon as he hung up with me.

02:31.940 --> 02:32.972
Thank God.

02:32.974 --> 02:34.206
Yeah, no kidding.

02:34.208 --> 02:35.441
Listen...

02:35.443 --> 02:37.543
Hi, Mom!
Awesome!

02:37.545 --> 02:39.312
Yeah, I'm picking the boys up
right now,

02:39.314 --> 02:40.913
so could you call
Erin and Henry?

02:40.915 --> 02:42.615
You know, make sure
they're not worried, too.

02:42.617 --> 02:43.783
Yeah, they already are.

02:43.785 --> 02:45.284
Thanks, Linda.

02:45.286 --> 02:47.853
(panting)

02:47.855 --> 02:50.022
(groans)

02:52.059 --> 02:54.193
(sighs)

02:56.063 --> 02:58.030
I'm glad it wasn't Danny.

02:58.032 --> 03:00.333
There, I said it.

03:00.335 --> 03:03.169
I felt the same way.

03:03.171 --> 03:04.303
Danny's family.

03:04.305 --> 03:07.039
Steve Tomlin has one, too.

03:07.041 --> 03:09.308
Let's hope for the best.

03:10.744 --> 03:11.978
Dino says

03:11.980 --> 03:13.879
Steve has been undercover
for the last year,

03:13.881 --> 03:16.082
working his way up the chain
of a drug operation

03:16.084 --> 03:18.351
run by Santo Castillo.

03:18.353 --> 03:20.186
Somebody made him.

03:20.188 --> 03:22.455
Word is,
after Castillo shot him,

03:22.457 --> 03:24.690
Steve managed to put
a slug in Castillo,

03:24.692 --> 03:25.891
who ran off.

03:25.893 --> 03:28.561
Tough cop.

03:28.563 --> 03:30.963
Gave him the Combat Cross
in '09.

03:30.965 --> 03:33.165
(door opens)

03:36.670 --> 03:38.704
Commissioner?

03:38.706 --> 03:41.140
How's my officer?

03:41.142 --> 03:43.175
Um, I'm afraid he's gone.

03:43.177 --> 03:45.478
Three bullets,
one through the carotid.

03:45.480 --> 03:49.482
He lost too much blood
by the time he arrived.

03:50.417 --> 03:52.618
Thank you, Doctor.

04:00.394 --> 04:03.462
I'll need to talk to his wife.

04:03.464 --> 04:04.864
Lorraine.

04:04.866 --> 04:06.966
Married to Steve for 22 years,

04:06.968 --> 04:08.401
tax accountant by trade.

04:08.403 --> 04:10.603
They have a home
in Staten Island.

04:12.706 --> 04:14.807
Frank, she's here.

04:16.000 --> 04:22.074

04:26.386 --> 04:28.854
Two daughters,
Bella and Lucy,

04:28.856 --> 04:31.023
both in college.

04:38.432 --> 04:40.599
Mrs. Tomlin?

04:42.302 --> 04:44.403
I'm so sorry.

04:48.575 --> 04:52.478
Can I arrange to get Lucy
and Bella home from school?

04:52.480 --> 04:54.880
Oh, that, uh...

04:54.882 --> 04:56.715
Uh, yes.

04:56.717 --> 04:59.285
Um, thank you.

04:59.287 --> 05:01.620
My department owes Steve

05:01.622 --> 05:05.224
a deep debt of gratitude
for his years of service.

05:05.226 --> 05:07.259
Anything we can do to help,

05:07.261 --> 05:09.195
you only need to ask.

05:09.197 --> 05:12.765
Catch whoever murdered
my husband.

05:14.167 --> 05:16.569
We will do that.

That's not the answer
I want to hear, Dino.

05:53.979 --> 05:55.579
Yes, sir.
Morning, Baker.

05:55.581 --> 05:57.147
Morning, sir.

05:57.149 --> 05:58.582
Castillo was shot.

05:58.584 --> 06:00.284
That would've slowed him down.

06:00.286 --> 06:02.719
He hasn't turned up in
any E.R. in the tri-state.

06:02.721 --> 06:04.388
I've got the whole department
out looking.

06:04.390 --> 06:06.356
Half of them are doing it
on their own time.

06:06.358 --> 06:08.225
Who'd you put with the family?

06:08.227 --> 06:10.394
Johnson and Garcia. They came up
in the ranks together.

06:10.396 --> 06:11.795
And on the case?

06:11.797 --> 06:13.764
Sergeant Gormley said he gave it

06:13.766 --> 06:15.265
to the best detective he's got.

06:19.137 --> 06:20.838
(sighs)

06:20.840 --> 06:22.873

06:22.875 --> 06:24.007
DANNY:
On the ground!

06:24.009 --> 06:25.442
Get on the ground!

06:28.713 --> 06:30.848
Move it!

06:34.319 --> 06:36.186
Back away from that sink!

06:36.888 --> 06:38.355
On the ground now!

06:38.357 --> 06:39.490
Turn around, get on the ground,

06:39.492 --> 06:41.191
put your hands behind your head!

06:41.193 --> 06:42.793
Where's your boss?

06:42.795 --> 06:44.061
Who?

06:44.063 --> 06:45.963
You heard me. Castillo.

06:45.965 --> 06:47.631
Yo, we're just cleaning crew.
Yeah?

06:47.633 --> 06:50.067
My cleaning lady keeps
a bazooka, too.

06:50.069 --> 06:52.369
Still enough here
to send you down the drain.

06:52.371 --> 06:54.171
What's your name?
Ticky.

06:54.173 --> 06:56.340
Ticky, you want a break?
Give up the cop killer.

06:56.342 --> 06:58.475
Like he said,
we don't know anything.

06:58.477 --> 06:59.843
Fine, you want to play stupid
with me,

06:59.845 --> 07:01.245
get your hands up on the sink.

07:01.247 --> 07:02.479
Move! I got all the time

07:02.481 --> 07:04.681
in the world
till you decide to wise up.

07:04.683 --> 07:06.550
As far as I'm concerned,

07:06.552 --> 07:08.952
each one of you pulled
the trigger on Steve Tomlin.

07:08.954 --> 07:10.921
You're all coming for a ride;
let's go.

07:10.923 --> 07:12.723
Get them out of here.

07:14.726 --> 07:17.261
Erin, that was impressive.

07:17.263 --> 07:18.862
Well, sometimes when you get
the right witness,

07:18.864 --> 07:20.330
the whole case will fall
into place.

07:20.332 --> 07:21.798
Well, I'll get her
statement typed up

07:21.800 --> 07:23.367
and to the DA by lunch.
Great.

07:23.369 --> 07:25.135
Can you find the car?

07:25.137 --> 07:26.436
Lady,
can you give me some help?

07:26.438 --> 07:28.405
Sorry, I don't have any change.

07:28.407 --> 07:30.173
I mean a different kind of help.

07:30.175 --> 07:31.375
Tyler?

07:31.377 --> 07:33.110
What?

07:33.112 --> 07:34.778
Tyler Jeffries. I'm Nicky's mom.

07:34.780 --> 07:37.447
Uh, my-my name's not Tyler.
From Blessed Heart.

07:37.449 --> 07:39.616
You came to our house
for Nicky's birthday party

07:39.618 --> 07:41.785
last year.
I said I'm not him.

07:41.787 --> 07:42.920
Forget it.

07:42.922 --> 07:44.087
Tyler, are you okay?

07:44.089 --> 07:45.489
Here we go, Erin.

07:45.491 --> 07:46.857
Yeah, I'll be right there.

07:46.859 --> 07:48.392
Tyler!

08:00.405 --> 08:03.640
Put him in interrogation.

08:03.642 --> 08:05.008
This one in the radio room.

08:05.010 --> 08:07.010
Cuff the others
to something solid.

08:07.012 --> 08:08.779
Don't let them talk
to each other

08:08.781 --> 08:10.380
or so much as trade glances.

08:10.382 --> 08:11.882
This goes real easy, fellas.

08:11.884 --> 08:14.418
First one to give up Castillo
wins the prize.

08:14.420 --> 08:15.953
You get the radio room;
I got the box.

08:15.955 --> 08:17.220
Got it.

08:18.022 --> 08:19.289
GORMLEY:
Reagan, you want help?

08:19.291 --> 08:21.792
No.
I got cops from a dozen precincts

08:21.794 --> 08:23.860
volunteering to turn the screws
on these guys.

08:23.862 --> 08:25.762
No, we're gonna get a
crack at them first.

08:25.764 --> 08:27.631
All right, listen,
Steve kept me in the loop

08:27.633 --> 08:29.466
on this Castillo.
Says his people

08:29.468 --> 08:31.034
are unusually loyal.

08:31.036 --> 08:32.936
Boss of the year?
Great, I'm jealous.

08:32.938 --> 08:34.605
Well, I'm just saying,
you might hit a brick wall.

08:34.607 --> 08:36.239
Then I'll drag his family
in here.

08:36.241 --> 08:37.741
If you can find them.
Apparently he has

08:37.743 --> 08:39.943
a sister, but Castillo
made her change her name

08:39.945 --> 08:42.212
so nobody could find her and use
her against him in some way.

08:42.214 --> 08:44.381
Do you have any more words
of encouragement here, Sarge,

08:44.383 --> 08:46.416
'cause this level of optimism
is really firing me up.

08:46.418 --> 08:47.684
All right, just-just holler

08:47.686 --> 08:49.052
if you need help, all right?

08:49.054 --> 08:50.621
If you hear any hollering,
it won't be me.

08:50.623 --> 08:51.955
Open it up.

08:54.792 --> 08:56.927
Hi.

08:56.929 --> 08:58.729
Hey.

08:58.731 --> 09:00.230
What are you doing?

09:00.232 --> 09:02.599
Homework.

09:02.601 --> 09:03.967
Without being asked?

09:03.969 --> 09:06.670
Who are you and what have
you done with my daughter?

09:07.739 --> 09:09.339
How was your day?

09:09.341 --> 09:11.274
Weird.

09:11.276 --> 09:15.178
You know that boy
from your class, Tyler Jeffries?

09:15.180 --> 09:16.213
Yeah.

09:16.215 --> 09:17.648
What's his story?

09:17.650 --> 09:19.383
Funny.

09:19.385 --> 09:20.717
Super nice.

09:20.719 --> 09:22.519
He's not in my class anymore,
though.

09:22.521 --> 09:25.188
He and his mom moved, like,
five months ago.

09:25.190 --> 09:27.758
I guess Tyler was
getting high and stuff,

09:27.760 --> 09:29.693
so his mom put him

09:29.695 --> 09:31.528
in boarding school upstate
to straighten him out.

09:31.530 --> 09:33.397
Well, I don't think it worked.

09:33.399 --> 09:34.898
What do you mean?

09:34.900 --> 09:37.668
I ran into him today
in Hell's Kitchen,

09:37.670 --> 09:41.672
and he looked messed up on drugs
or homeless or both.

09:41.674 --> 09:43.340
What?
Yeah, it took me a second

09:43.342 --> 09:44.775
to even recognize him.

09:44.777 --> 09:47.177
Oh, my God.

09:47.179 --> 09:48.879
But you helped him, right?

09:48.881 --> 09:50.313
Well, he ran off before I could.

09:50.315 --> 09:52.315
Then we got to go find him.

09:52.317 --> 09:53.917
Well, I will call
Child Services,

09:53.919 --> 09:55.385
and they will contact
his mother.

09:55.387 --> 09:57.154
Come on, can we just go look
for him?

09:57.156 --> 09:58.689
Relax, all right?

09:58.691 --> 10:00.123
I will handle it.

10:01.626 --> 10:03.860
(scoffs)

10:06.264 --> 10:08.432
Get him out of my face.

10:10.134 --> 10:11.835
Nothing?
Nothing.

10:11.837 --> 10:14.271
None of my guys even
so much as asked for a lawyer.

10:14.273 --> 10:16.540
They just sat there
smirking at me.

10:16.542 --> 10:17.974
You?
Same.

10:17.976 --> 10:19.076
So what's next?

10:19.078 --> 10:20.644
Pot of coffee.

10:20.646 --> 10:22.546
Yeah, I'll go make one.
Thanks.

10:22.548 --> 10:23.747
GORMLEY:
How's it going?

10:23.749 --> 10:24.948
Don't ask.

10:24.950 --> 10:26.650
Okay, so you want
to give me a hand?

10:26.652 --> 10:28.118
I'm kind of busy here, Sarge.

10:28.120 --> 10:30.320
I need a witness
to open Steve Tomlin's locker,

10:30.322 --> 10:32.756
collect his effects
to give to his family.

10:32.758 --> 10:34.925
Okay, I'll get a box.

10:40.098 --> 10:43.700
I always hate this more
than the funeral.

10:43.702 --> 10:45.068
A life interrupted
and all.

10:45.070 --> 10:46.536
Well, at least there's
no bagpipes.

10:46.538 --> 10:48.338
They always make me cry.

10:54.846 --> 10:56.780
It's empty.

11:00.785 --> 11:02.018
I talked to Steve yesterday

11:02.020 --> 11:03.687
before he started
his tour, Sarge.

11:03.689 --> 11:05.422
His locker was open
and it was full.

11:05.424 --> 11:06.790
His uniform was in there,

11:06.792 --> 11:09.326
there were papers everywhere
and pictures.

11:09.328 --> 11:11.762
Somebody must've cleaned
it out after he died.

11:11.764 --> 11:12.996
But before we could find it.

11:12.998 --> 11:15.699
Who the hell's hiding what?

11:32.064 --> 11:33.431
277.

11:36.268 --> 11:39.437
The number of cops lost
in the line of duty

11:39.439 --> 11:41.239
since you've been
on the job.

11:41.241 --> 11:44.575
And now 23 since
sitting behind this desk.

11:44.577 --> 11:47.278
You want me to do a draft
of your remarks

11:47.280 --> 11:48.346
for the service?

11:48.348 --> 11:49.814
You ask me every time, Garrett.

11:49.816 --> 11:51.449
And I'm gonna keep asking.

11:51.451 --> 11:56.053
Some things you can't delegate,
even a piece of.

11:56.055 --> 11:59.690
But you could take a look at it
when I'm done.

12:01.994 --> 12:03.194
Castillo?

12:03.196 --> 12:05.162
Not yet. Last night

12:05.164 --> 12:06.264
Sergeant Gormley went

12:06.266 --> 12:07.565
to collect
Steve Tomlin's things,

12:07.567 --> 12:09.066
but somebody got
there first.

12:09.068 --> 12:10.134
Locker was
completely empty.

12:10.136 --> 12:13.037
Someone sanitized it.

12:13.039 --> 12:15.906
And no way was it a civilian
just waltzing in off the street.

12:15.908 --> 12:17.174
GARRETT:
I don't get it.

12:17.176 --> 12:19.110
What's the big deal
about a guy's locker?

12:19.112 --> 12:20.578
What's in it. Or isn't.

12:20.580 --> 12:23.581
Any evidence of tampering goes
right up the chain of command.

12:23.583 --> 12:26.150
What, you think Castillo's got
a mole in the 5-4?

12:26.152 --> 12:27.351
That's the bad version.

12:27.353 --> 12:31.522
I got a worse one: someone's
covering for Tomlin.

12:33.058 --> 12:34.859
We got a problem, Chief.

12:34.861 --> 12:37.628
You sure this is a "we," Frank?

12:37.630 --> 12:40.131
Wouldn't it be better and
quieter if the department dealt

12:40.133 --> 12:42.066
with this on the precinct level?

12:44.303 --> 12:45.503
No.

12:52.678 --> 12:54.412
Thanks for coming, Uncle Jamie.

12:54.414 --> 12:56.447
Everything okay?
Your text said it was "serious."

12:56.449 --> 12:57.682
Yeah, it's about a friend
of mine.

12:57.684 --> 12:59.116
A friend?

12:59.118 --> 13:02.386
No, really, he's a great kid.
Name's Tyler.

13:02.388 --> 13:03.854
He went to my school,

13:03.856 --> 13:06.390
but Mom said she saw him
in Hell's Kitchen

13:06.392 --> 13:08.059
looking like
he was on drugs.

13:08.061 --> 13:09.560
Did he use when you knew him?

13:09.562 --> 13:12.496
I know he smoked pot sometimes.

13:12.498 --> 13:15.633
No, I don't. But if I did,

13:15.635 --> 13:18.102
and it'd help find Tyler,
then I'd admit it.

13:18.104 --> 13:19.904
So you want me to look for him.

13:19.906 --> 13:21.238
Could you?

13:21.240 --> 13:23.474
Mom said it was around
35th and 10th.

13:23.476 --> 13:25.443
That's a pretty sketchy area.

13:25.445 --> 13:27.044
Yeah, I know.

13:27.046 --> 13:29.580
Here, that's what
he looks like.

13:30.982 --> 13:34.318
Your mom know you want me
to do this?

13:34.320 --> 13:35.786
Yeah, she's
really worried, too.

13:35.788 --> 13:37.988
She would've been here,
but she wanted to go talk

13:37.990 --> 13:39.590
to Child Services
about him.

13:41.927 --> 13:44.028
All right, I'll see
what I can do.

13:44.030 --> 13:46.163
Thanks, Uncle Jamie.

13:50.202 --> 13:52.036
And this isn't
just me saying it.

13:52.038 --> 13:55.106
This comes straight
from the commissioner:

13:55.108 --> 13:58.075
"Someone in the 5-4 cleaned out
Steve Tomlin's locker

13:58.077 --> 13:59.110
"without authorization...

13:59.112 --> 14:02.413
"or knows who did.

14:02.415 --> 14:05.116
"Which may very well be impeding
the murder investigation

14:05.118 --> 14:07.752
"of a brother in blue
to each and every one of you.

14:07.754 --> 14:09.587
"So let me be clear.

14:09.589 --> 14:11.756
"If Detective Tomlin's
belongings don't end up

14:11.758 --> 14:13.791
"in my office by 2400 hours,

14:13.793 --> 14:15.559
there'll be hell to pay."

14:15.561 --> 14:16.994
For all of us.

14:16.996 --> 14:20.531
So, folks, while the rest of us
get back to finding this

14:20.533 --> 14:22.833
son of a bitch Castillo,

14:22.835 --> 14:25.369
one of you is gonna stand up
and do the right thing.

14:25.371 --> 14:27.638
You owe it to Steve.

14:27.640 --> 14:29.874
That's all.

14:31.510 --> 14:33.644
And you two, you got
some data to dig through,

14:33.646 --> 14:36.147
so get to it.

14:36.149 --> 14:38.349
BAEZ:
So, who do you think it is?

14:38.351 --> 14:40.851
I don't want to believe anybody
in this room could be capable

14:40.853 --> 14:42.319
of being Castillo's mole.

14:42.321 --> 14:44.989
Well, he found out Tomlin
was undercover somehow.

14:44.991 --> 14:46.323
Well, maybe we'll get lucky

14:46.325 --> 14:49.660
and find it in all this data
we gotta look through.

14:50.093 --> 14:52.627
Well, looks like TARU found
a bunch of steamy text messages

14:52.629 --> 14:54.095
from one of our
thug's cell phones.

14:54.097 --> 14:55.129
Which thug?

14:55.131 --> 14:57.165
Said it belonged to Ticky,

14:57.167 --> 14:59.000
the one who was dumping
the coke earlier.

14:59.002 --> 15:00.702
I grilled him.
He didn't say squat.

15:00.704 --> 15:03.071
Well, it looks like
he had a lot to say

15:03.073 --> 15:06.140
when he was sexting
this Vivian girl.

15:06.142 --> 15:08.476
Look who he says
her brother is.

15:08.478 --> 15:09.677
Castillo.

15:09.679 --> 15:11.512
Son of a bitch.

15:11.514 --> 15:13.414
He was transported down
to Central Booking.

15:13.416 --> 15:16.150
Let's get his ass
back here now.

15:19.788 --> 15:23.691
Ah, another day
of crime-fighting.

15:23.693 --> 15:26.094
We should get capes.

15:26.096 --> 15:27.996
I should get a new partner.
(laughs)

15:27.998 --> 15:31.399
So why did you ask the boss
for this sector today?

15:31.401 --> 15:33.034
A favor for my
niece and sister.

15:33.036 --> 15:35.436
A friend of Nicky's
was in this area the other day

15:35.438 --> 15:37.872
looking kind of rough,
so I said I'd look for him.

15:37.874 --> 15:40.275
Man, you do more
for your family by 9:00 a.m.

15:40.277 --> 15:42.543
than my family's done
for each other our entire lives.

15:42.545 --> 15:44.679
Name's Tyler Jeffries,
about five-foot-eight, he's 16,

15:44.681 --> 15:47.015
he's got blond hair.

15:47.017 --> 15:48.816
I got a picture
of him here.

15:48.818 --> 15:50.985
Yo, why do I gotta be back
here for?

15:50.987 --> 15:52.553
I still don't got nothing
to say.

15:52.555 --> 15:53.988
Why don't you relax, Ticky?

15:53.990 --> 15:55.657
Why do they even call you
Ticky, anyway?

15:55.659 --> 15:57.892
Is it because you're a leech
on a big fish

15:57.894 --> 15:59.260
like Santo Castillo,
is that it?

15:59.262 --> 16:01.029
I like watches.

16:01.031 --> 16:03.932
Which is appropriate
since your time's running out,

16:03.934 --> 16:06.200
unless you tell us where
to find your boss.

16:06.202 --> 16:07.902
Yo, like I told you before,

16:07.904 --> 16:09.537
I don't know who
you're talking about.

16:09.539 --> 16:11.739
Really? Even though
you're banging his sister...

16:11.741 --> 16:12.740
what is, uh, Vivian?

16:12.742 --> 16:14.676
Say what?

16:14.678 --> 16:18.112
Say you right here
in these text messages.

16:18.114 --> 16:20.415
"Viv, u were incredible
last nite as always."

16:20.417 --> 16:22.583
To which she replied...

16:22.585 --> 16:26.654
"Keep it on the DL, baby. My bro
will kill us if he finds out."

16:26.656 --> 16:27.989
To which you replied...

16:27.991 --> 16:30.658
"U kidding? Santo heart me.

16:30.660 --> 16:33.962
And I could kick,
I could kick his ass anyway."

16:33.964 --> 16:35.496
That's a different Santo.

16:35.498 --> 16:37.198
Hmm.
Really?

16:37.200 --> 16:39.033
Even though Vivian wrote back...

16:39.035 --> 16:42.971
"Santo only hearts his $
and his drugs.

16:42.973 --> 16:44.372
Watch yourself."

16:44.374 --> 16:46.341
To which you replied...

16:46.343 --> 16:48.209
"I only wanna watch u, baby."

16:48.211 --> 16:50.945
Oh, smooth talker, I'll give him that.
Yeah.

16:50.947 --> 16:52.513
Yeah. Let's just hope

16:52.515 --> 16:56.784
he's smooth enough to talk Santo
out of blowing his brains out.

16:59.254 --> 17:00.221
Okay, okay!

17:00.223 --> 17:02.090
So I been hooking up
with his sister.

17:02.092 --> 17:04.058
Great. Now you can tell us
where she lives.

17:04.060 --> 17:05.193
I can't tell you.

17:05.194 --> 17:08.496
You know one big difference
between you and I?

17:08.498 --> 17:11.898
Is that I'm not afraid
of your boss, unlike you.

17:11.901 --> 17:13.134
In fact, when I see him,

17:13.136 --> 17:15.502
I'm pretty much
gonna tell him that

17:15.505 --> 17:17.271
you told us everything.
In fact,

17:17.272 --> 17:22.777
maybe I'll even show him
this lovely little picture

17:22.779 --> 17:24.779
that his sister sent to you.

17:26.048 --> 17:28.816
Please, look,

17:28.818 --> 17:32.320
if I give him up,
he's gonna have me killed.

17:32.322 --> 17:33.388
Her, too.

17:33.390 --> 17:34.655
Aw...

17:34.657 --> 17:36.591
Which means we're the only ones
who can protect you,

17:36.593 --> 17:37.992
as long as you start talking.

17:37.994 --> 17:42.130
Yep, so why don't you tell us
where she lives?

17:42.132 --> 17:43.431
Now!

17:50.072 --> 17:52.407
Police! Open up!

17:53.842 --> 17:55.109
You can't just walk in here.

17:55.111 --> 17:57.912
Yeah? Well, this says we can.
Step aside. Step aside!

17:57.914 --> 17:59.213
See how easy that works?

17:59.215 --> 18:00.882
Let's go!
Don't touch me!

18:00.884 --> 18:03.518
Come on. Tear this
place apart. Let's go.

18:03.520 --> 18:05.186
You can't just do that,
all right?

18:05.188 --> 18:06.454
I know my rights.

18:06.456 --> 18:07.622
Where's your brother, Vivian?

18:07.624 --> 18:08.723
I don't have one.

18:08.725 --> 18:10.224
Santo Castillo,
you're his sister

18:10.226 --> 18:12.093
Dolores, until he made you
change your name

18:12.095 --> 18:13.094
to Vivian Vasquez.

18:13.096 --> 18:14.429
What are you talking about?

18:14.431 --> 18:16.097
Do you think we're stupid?
He got shot up.

18:16.099 --> 18:17.532
You're a nurse.
Where else would he go?

18:17.534 --> 18:20.435
Maybe to his real sister,
'cause you got the wrong place.

18:20.437 --> 18:21.969
So you all can kiss my ass!

18:21.971 --> 18:23.704
Hey! Your brother's
a cop killer.

18:23.706 --> 18:26.407
And he's going down hard.
And if you're harboring him,

18:26.409 --> 18:28.409
you're gonna go down
just as hard, you understand?

18:28.411 --> 18:31.512
And I ain't going nowhere
'cause I'm the only one here.

18:31.514 --> 18:33.681
OFFICER: Hands where I can see 'em!
Is that right?

18:33.683 --> 18:34.949
MAN: Let me go!
I didn't do nothing!

18:34.951 --> 18:37.785
OFFICER: Perp in custody!
You were saying?

18:37.787 --> 18:40.254
OFFICER 2: Come on, come on.
He hid in the tub.

18:40.256 --> 18:42.190
Yeah, real original.

18:42.192 --> 18:44.025
Hope you got clean, Castillo,
'cause that's the last shower

18:44.027 --> 18:45.660
you're gonna take by yourself
for a long time.

18:45.662 --> 18:47.228
Yeah, and if you think
you're in a bad mood now,

18:47.230 --> 18:49.697
wait till you find out
your sister's screwing the help.

18:49.699 --> 18:51.532
What's he saying?

18:51.534 --> 18:53.013
Santo, I can explain.

18:53.038 --> 18:54.937
You'll explain it to him later.
Get him the hell out of here.

18:55.071 --> 18:57.238
OFFICER 1:
Get him in the hallway.

19:01.076 --> 19:02.944
Take a look
at 'em all, Castillo.

19:02.946 --> 19:06.380
Every cop in here wants
to take a piece out of you. Open up.

19:06.382 --> 19:08.549
I want my lawyer.
Won't do you any good.

19:08.551 --> 19:10.718
Next stop for you
is a deep, dark hole.

19:10.720 --> 19:12.620
Yeah, and on your way down,
you can tell us

19:12.622 --> 19:13.754
who helped you set up Steve.

19:13.756 --> 19:15.123
What?

19:15.125 --> 19:18.659
Your mole inside
this precinct.

19:18.661 --> 19:20.328
(laughs):
If that's what you think,

19:20.330 --> 19:22.358
you ain't never gonna figure out
how I found out.

19:22.359 --> 19:22.907
Right.

19:22.932 --> 19:25.007
BAEZ: Giving up the cop
who set up Steve

19:25.135 --> 19:28.936
is the only card you've got--
tell your lawyer to play it.

19:30.139 --> 19:35.209
Let's go-- I want to wash
this dirtbag off my hands.

19:40.349 --> 19:44.152
Checking to see if Castillo's
gonna give you up, Becker?

19:44.154 --> 19:46.487
You're out of your mind.

19:46.489 --> 19:47.788
What's your problem?

19:47.790 --> 19:50.725
Thought opening lockers
was your specialty.

19:51.860 --> 19:53.194
Steve's locker's
right behind me.

19:53.196 --> 19:55.930
That gives you plenty of opportunity
to scope out his combination,

19:55.932 --> 19:58.104
or eavesdrop and see how close
he's getting to Castillo.

19:58.105 --> 19:58.946
Listen, Detective...

19:58.971 --> 20:00.536
The only thing
I'm listening to, Becker,

20:00.537 --> 20:02.770
is you admit to
it right now.

20:02.772 --> 20:05.039
Okay, fine, it was me.

20:05.041 --> 20:06.607
I cleaned it out!

20:06.609 --> 20:07.775
You Castillo's mole?

20:07.777 --> 20:10.144
Huh?
No, you got that wrong!

20:10.146 --> 20:13.214
I don't have it wrong.
And if I do, you better tell me why.

20:13.216 --> 20:14.382
Why'd you do it?!

20:15.017 --> 20:16.317
Hey, beat it!

20:16.319 --> 20:19.487
Both of you, beat it now!

20:19.489 --> 20:20.922
It's none of your damn business.

20:20.924 --> 20:22.089
Start talking, Becker.

20:22.091 --> 20:23.724
I just copped to it, Reagan.

20:23.726 --> 20:25.793
But that's all I got to say.

20:33.835 --> 20:35.603
(sighs quietly)

20:35.605 --> 20:39.440
And you understand the
consequences of what you did?

20:39.442 --> 20:41.642
Possible grand larceny,

20:41.644 --> 20:44.912
possible criminal
possession of stolen property,

20:44.914 --> 20:47.114
possible conspiracy

20:47.116 --> 20:49.917
in the murder of
a police officer.

20:49.919 --> 20:51.852
Yes, sir.
Yet you didn't ask

20:51.854 --> 20:54.355
for a lawyer or a union rep.

20:54.357 --> 20:56.257
I don't need one, sir.

20:56.259 --> 20:59.994
It was me who cleaned out
Steve Tomlin's locker.

20:59.996 --> 21:01.495
On a cop killer's orders?

21:01.497 --> 21:03.898
I'm no one's mole

21:03.900 --> 21:06.634
and I don't know how
Steve's cover got blown.

21:08.270 --> 21:09.937
(sighs)

21:11.073 --> 21:12.406
At ease.

21:14.476 --> 21:16.277
Sit down.

21:23.986 --> 21:26.420
What you did doesn't square
with your record.

21:29.825 --> 21:32.426
Come on, Bill.

21:32.428 --> 21:34.228
I know you're
sitting on something.

21:34.230 --> 21:37.798
Six years ago...

21:37.800 --> 21:39.934
I was still on probation...

21:39.936 --> 21:41.702
and me and my training officer

21:41.704 --> 21:45.273
heard this bank heist call
go over the air.

21:47.075 --> 21:49.210
Steve was already on the scene
when we got there,

21:49.212 --> 21:52.380
and all of a sudden,

21:52.382 --> 21:53.481
these robbers burst out,

21:53.483 --> 21:55.816
guns blazing...

21:55.818 --> 21:58.486
and...

21:58.488 --> 21:59.954
I froze.

21:59.956 --> 22:01.822
I assume
this is going somewhere.

22:01.824 --> 22:04.792
Steve pushed me out of the way

22:04.794 --> 22:07.395
before I got my head
blown off...

22:07.397 --> 22:11.232
and he took down both the perps.

22:11.234 --> 22:12.433
He...

22:12.435 --> 22:13.901
He saved the day.

22:13.903 --> 22:17.505
That night I bought
all his drinks and...

22:17.507 --> 22:19.206
we became friends.

22:19.208 --> 22:21.542
So you owed him?

22:23.745 --> 22:26.180
What was he mixed up in?

22:27.683 --> 22:31.152
Steve was clean
as a whistle, sir.

22:32.287 --> 22:35.389
And-and this has nothing
to do with the job.

22:35.391 --> 22:38.159
Then I know he wouldn't want you

22:38.161 --> 22:40.928
to blow up your career
over this.

22:45.767 --> 22:48.235
(sighs)

22:49.504 --> 22:52.473
He has another family.

23:08.795 --> 23:10.463
(water running)

23:12.098 --> 23:13.766
Wait, so you saw Tyler?

23:13.768 --> 23:15.768
Yeah. About a block down
from where your mom saw him.

23:15.771 --> 23:17.203
He was digging through
a trash can.

23:17.205 --> 23:18.638
Was he on drugs?

23:18.640 --> 23:20.240
He didn't look good.

23:20.242 --> 23:21.775
But, you-you
took him home, right?

23:21.777 --> 23:23.310
No. We never
got the chance.

23:23.312 --> 23:25.478
He pushed Eddie pretty hard
and then he ran.

23:25.480 --> 23:28.481
We went after him, but...
he was gone, just like that.

23:28.483 --> 23:30.450
(sighs) God. So, he's still out there?
Unfortunately, yeah,

23:30.452 --> 23:33.119
but I gave his photo to all
the cars in the precinct

23:33.121 --> 23:36.256
and I'm gonna ask for the
same assignment tomorrow, okay?

23:36.258 --> 23:37.724
ERIN:
Like hell you will.

23:37.726 --> 23:39.326
Mom!

23:39.328 --> 23:41.595
I was just telling
Uncle Jamie about...

23:41.597 --> 23:43.229
Yeah.
I heard all about it.

23:43.231 --> 23:44.364
You sent him out looking?

23:44.366 --> 23:45.432
Just let me explain.

23:45.434 --> 23:46.633
JAMIE:
Wait. What?

23:46.635 --> 23:48.301
I thought you said
your mom knew about this?

23:48.303 --> 23:49.903
Would you both
just listen to me?

23:50.738 --> 23:52.038
Look, I had to make sure
Tyler got help

23:52.040 --> 23:53.273
before something bad happened.

23:53.275 --> 23:55.642
So that justifies
going behind my back?

23:55.644 --> 23:57.077
And lying to me, Nicky?

23:57.079 --> 23:58.445
I'm sorry.

23:59.513 --> 24:00.814
But maybe if you didn't treat me

24:00.816 --> 24:01.982
like I'm still a little kid...

24:01.984 --> 24:04.317
Well, you just proved
that you are, by ignoring me

24:04.319 --> 24:05.819
when I said
I would take care of it.

24:05.821 --> 24:09.756
So, did you?
I spoke to ACS,

24:09.758 --> 24:11.291
they've reached out
to Tyler's mom,

24:11.293 --> 24:12.792
and I haven't heard back yet.

24:12.794 --> 24:15.195
So now he's out there somewhere
doing God knows what

24:15.197 --> 24:16.363
with God knows who.

24:16.365 --> 24:18.098
The conversation's over.

24:26.007 --> 24:29.275
If you don't eat
your vegetables, no dessert.

24:29.277 --> 24:31.678
Delicious, as always.

24:31.680 --> 24:34.614
You hardly ate.

24:34.616 --> 24:36.816
I ate.

24:39.053 --> 24:40.253
Who made the potatoes?

24:40.255 --> 24:41.655
Uh, I think
it was Nicky.

24:41.657 --> 24:42.622
Better not say
you didn't like 'em.

24:42.624 --> 24:43.523
Loved 'em.

24:43.525 --> 24:45.659
Good and cheesy.
(chuckles)

24:45.661 --> 24:48.928
I'm surprised you found time
to cook.

24:48.930 --> 24:51.631
I managed.
Mm-hmm.

24:53.734 --> 24:55.568
We missing something here?

24:55.570 --> 24:57.103
Feeling a little
cold chill

24:57.105 --> 25:00.040
coming from this
side of the table.

25:00.042 --> 25:01.508
What's going on?

25:01.510 --> 25:04.077
Nothing anyone needs
to know about.

25:04.079 --> 25:07.247
See, Francis? Hard enough having
even one family some days.

25:08.349 --> 25:11.384
Boys, take your plates
and go eat in the kitchen.

25:11.386 --> 25:12.819
So you guys can have
a conversation

25:12.821 --> 25:13.987
we're not supposed to hear?

25:13.989 --> 25:15.455
That's exactly right, Jack.

25:15.457 --> 25:16.556
Go on.

25:16.558 --> 25:18.625
Come on, I'll eat with you.

25:30.933 --> 25:32.434
Go easy on this, Pop.

25:32.436 --> 25:34.636
I'm not going to pussyfoot
around this.

25:34.638 --> 25:36.771
What kind
of cop

25:36.773 --> 25:38.940
has two families?

25:38.942 --> 25:41.509
What? Who?
The one that got killed?

25:41.511 --> 25:42.711
Yeah.
Yeah,

25:42.713 --> 25:44.446
Steve Tomlin.
He had a wife

25:44.448 --> 25:46.047
and two kids
in Staten Island

25:46.049 --> 25:48.383
and a girlfriend with
a newborn baby in Jersey.

25:48.385 --> 25:50.218
LINDA:
And you didn't know?

25:51.153 --> 25:52.587
Steve is in your squad.

25:52.589 --> 25:54.189
He was in my squad and
I'm friendly with him,

25:54.191 --> 25:56.596
but pretty much nobody knew
what was going on with him.

25:56.597 --> 25:58.561
Well, you know what,
one of those women knew

25:58.562 --> 25:59.761
what was going on,

25:59.763 --> 26:01.730
and it was probably
the girlfriend.

26:01.732 --> 26:03.098
So she doesn't deserve
any sympathy?

26:03.100 --> 26:04.566
He's the father of her kid.

26:04.568 --> 26:06.101
No, that's not what
I'm saying, Jamie.

26:06.103 --> 26:07.769
Maybe he was that good
of a catch

26:07.771 --> 26:09.471
that they were happy
to share him.

26:09.473 --> 26:10.939
(chuckles)
(scoffs)

26:10.941 --> 26:12.474
I personally just try
to figure out

26:12.476 --> 26:14.275
where a man finds the time
or energy

26:14.277 --> 26:15.810
to carry on with two families.

26:15.812 --> 26:17.979
You-you looking for some tips?

26:17.981 --> 26:19.481
DANNY: No, I'm not
looking for tips.

26:19.483 --> 26:20.815
I'm just saying
it's a mess.

26:20.817 --> 26:22.817
Which isn't over.

26:22.819 --> 26:25.153
Right, the funeral.

26:25.155 --> 26:27.889
Well, you can count me out. 
And we will.

26:27.891 --> 26:29.391
Oh, come on, Grandpa. We don't
really know what was going on

26:29.393 --> 26:31.626
with Tomlin's life. I mean,
maybe he was making the best

26:31.628 --> 26:33.094
of a bad situation, you know?

26:33.096 --> 26:35.430
You saying you excuse
what he did?

26:35.432 --> 26:37.065
No, I'm just saying
I'm reserving judgment

26:37.067 --> 26:38.566
until the smoke clears a little.

26:38.568 --> 26:39.634
Exactly.

26:40.636 --> 26:43.772
I got personal items
for two different women.

26:43.774 --> 26:44.706
Some need to go

26:44.708 --> 26:46.908
to the girlfriend.
Mmm,

26:46.910 --> 26:49.344
kind of got to side
with Gramps on this one.

26:49.346 --> 26:50.347
Thank you.

26:50.372 --> 26:52.419
There's a line, and men
know where it's drawn.

26:53.316 --> 26:55.984
You're also the cop on the case.

26:59.155 --> 27:02.457
Well, then I'll deliver
whatever I need to.

27:02.459 --> 27:04.726
Thank you, Danny.

27:04.728 --> 27:06.461
You got it, Dad.

27:10.399 --> 27:13.468
(siren chirping)

27:14.737 --> 27:16.438
Guess what sector
we got this morning.

27:16.440 --> 27:19.407
Judging by the smile
on your face, Restaurant Row.

27:19.409 --> 27:21.676
Back to Hell's Kitchen.

27:21.678 --> 27:24.712
Really?
Boss says we did great.

27:24.714 --> 27:27.082
15 summonses and
a felony collar.

27:27.084 --> 27:28.416
And I volunteered us

27:28.418 --> 27:29.984
since I know you want
to find Tyler again.

27:29.986 --> 27:30.985
Says who?

27:30.987 --> 27:32.854
Your niece put you
on the case.

27:32.856 --> 27:34.622
Yeah, until my sister
blew a gasket.

27:34.624 --> 27:36.124
Sergeant.
Come on,

27:36.126 --> 27:38.927
friend of Nicky's or not,
that kid needs help.

27:38.929 --> 27:40.628
So let's go
find him again.

27:40.630 --> 27:42.397
But he's not gonna be
hanging around Hell's Kitchen.

27:42.399 --> 27:43.898
Not after he knows
we're looking for him.

27:43.900 --> 27:45.834
Yeah, I thought the same thing till
I talked to a couple of guys

27:45.836 --> 27:48.470
in Narcotics who executed
a warrant on a drug spot

27:48.472 --> 27:50.805
on that very same
block this morning.

27:50.807 --> 27:54.742
And guess who was seen
running from the scene.

27:54.744 --> 27:58.413
Well, let's go look
for Tyler.

28:01.217 --> 28:04.285
I knew I loved him
from the moment we met.

28:08.190 --> 28:10.091
He moved me here,

28:10.093 --> 28:14.062
(baby cries) and pretty soon
she was on the way.

28:14.897 --> 28:17.398
And now it's just us two.

28:17.400 --> 28:19.567
I'm sorry it took so long,

28:19.569 --> 28:23.571
with all the... issues
around Steve.

28:23.573 --> 28:25.306
Issues?

28:27.309 --> 28:31.012
Did Steve stay home every night?

28:31.014 --> 28:33.515
No, he was undercover.

28:33.517 --> 28:35.383
Had to be gone a lot.

28:35.385 --> 28:38.353
Did he wear a ring?

28:38.355 --> 28:40.188
No, why would he?

28:40.190 --> 28:41.656
He was single.

28:45.194 --> 28:47.495
Detective,
what-what are you saying?

28:47.497 --> 28:50.331
I'm saying
that Steve Tomlin was married.

28:50.333 --> 28:52.634
No.

28:52.636 --> 28:55.203
He had two kids.
Both in their 20s.

28:55.205 --> 28:58.139
No. You're wrong.
He w... he was with me.

28:58.141 --> 29:01.876
We were going to get married,
just-just as soon as-as...

29:01.878 --> 29:04.712
as soon as...

29:12.855 --> 29:15.023
I'm sorry.

29:17.293 --> 29:20.728
Regardless of whether or not
he was married,

29:20.730 --> 29:22.397
it's obvious that he loved you.

29:22.399 --> 29:25.433
(scoffs)
You're defending him?

29:25.435 --> 29:28.102
Surprises me, too.

29:28.104 --> 29:31.873
Look, Steve could have abandoned
the both of you,

29:31.875 --> 29:33.741
but he didn't.

29:34.777 --> 29:37.245
In fact, you should probably
take a look at this.

29:37.247 --> 29:40.815
It was in his
locker, too.

29:40.817 --> 29:42.750
"Deferred compensation."

29:42.752 --> 29:44.485
Kind of like
a pension.

29:44.487 --> 29:47.155
Cop gets to choose
who the beneficiaries are,

29:47.157 --> 29:50.458
and Steve chose the both of you.

29:50.460 --> 29:53.861
So Angela will be taken care of?

29:53.863 --> 29:55.630
I'm not sure if he filed it.

29:55.632 --> 29:57.365
But it's obvious that
he wanted the both of you

29:57.367 --> 29:59.267
to be taken
care of.

29:59.269 --> 30:02.036
Do you think...
he would've done that

30:02.038 --> 30:04.072
if he didn't love you very much?

30:26.262 --> 30:27.895
Tyler Jeffries?

30:29.632 --> 30:30.531
Police!

30:39.408 --> 30:40.908
(panting):
Stop!

30:46.448 --> 30:48.449
Hold it right there.
Let me go. Please.

30:48.451 --> 30:50.118
Please let me go.
Please.

30:50.120 --> 30:51.519
Why? So you can go
get high again?

30:51.521 --> 30:53.421
Aw, sorry, buddy,
those days are over.

30:53.423 --> 30:56.090
Yeah. Along with shoving
police officers,

30:56.092 --> 30:59.160
which, by the way, is assault.

30:59.162 --> 31:01.496
Hey. We tried this
the easy way.

31:01.498 --> 31:03.097
Now you get the hard way.

31:03.099 --> 31:04.732
You got anything sharp
in your pockets,

31:04.734 --> 31:06.367
like a needle? Anything
that's gonna stick me?

31:06.369 --> 31:08.136
Look, I-I don't do drugs.

31:08.138 --> 31:09.170
Yeah, that's not
what my niece says.

31:09.172 --> 31:12.807
Look, I, I was a screwup
at school, okay?

31:12.809 --> 31:14.275
But I stopped all that.

31:14.277 --> 31:15.710
I swear.
Yeah?

31:15.712 --> 31:18.313
What were you passing around
with your pals back there?

31:18.315 --> 31:20.581
Your report card with all As?

31:21.450 --> 31:22.283
Huh?

31:22.285 --> 31:24.018
It was...

31:24.020 --> 31:26.754
it was her photo.

31:26.756 --> 31:28.723
To see if anyone's seen her.

31:28.725 --> 31:30.825
"Her" who, huh?

31:33.462 --> 31:34.562
Whoa, whoa.

31:34.564 --> 31:35.763
It's just a picture.

31:43.472 --> 31:45.039
My mom...

31:45.041 --> 31:47.275
came down here
a week ago to score

31:47.277 --> 31:50.144
and never came
back home.

31:51.146 --> 31:53.848
She's the junkie.

32:14.703 --> 32:17.805
Thanks for bringing these.

32:17.807 --> 32:20.641
The girls'll be happy to know
their father kept them so close.

32:20.643 --> 32:22.543
(sighs)

32:22.545 --> 32:26.180
I'm just trying
to carry out what...

32:26.182 --> 32:27.782
I think he'd want.

32:27.784 --> 32:30.585
Steve was a hell of a cop,
and I honor that.

32:31.361 --> 32:33.828
It's all he ever wanted to be.

32:33.830 --> 32:35.329
Well, I'll be sure
and say that

32:35.331 --> 32:37.532
when I stand up for him
at the funeral.

32:39.001 --> 32:42.336
And if there's anything else
my department can do...

32:42.338 --> 32:44.672
I only have to ask.

32:54.016 --> 32:55.983
Can I ask this?

32:55.985 --> 32:59.353
Could you please not
lie to me, Commissioner?

33:01.356 --> 33:03.324
Steve's lies
were bad enough, but

33:03.326 --> 33:07.295
to have all of you parade around
here with your sad smiles

33:07.297 --> 33:10.565
and your pats on the back
for the poor widow...

33:10.567 --> 33:12.433
and nobody has the guts to admit

33:12.435 --> 33:14.869
what I've known
for the past year?

33:18.807 --> 33:20.041
I'm not sure I understand.

33:20.043 --> 33:23.511
(short laugh)
Of course.

33:23.513 --> 33:27.515
Once I knew, I did
what every good wife does.

33:27.517 --> 33:29.650
Blamed myself.

33:29.652 --> 33:32.253
Tried to make him
love me again. I mean, I...

33:32.255 --> 33:34.422
I do love the guy.

33:35.657 --> 33:38.459
And the only time
I lost it was when I...

33:38.461 --> 33:40.695
I'd had too much
to drink and I...

33:40.697 --> 33:43.898
I found his phone and I called
the number I didn't recognize

33:43.900 --> 33:46.067
and I told the bitch off.

33:46.069 --> 33:49.403
Told her I was the one who had
stuck by him all these years

33:49.405 --> 33:51.005
and raised his family

33:51.007 --> 33:52.974
while he was out on the job.

33:52.976 --> 33:54.342
And I hung up the phone

33:54.344 --> 33:56.244
before she could
get a word in edgewise.

33:59.348 --> 34:00.848
(sighs)

34:00.850 --> 34:02.316
I'm very sorry.

34:02.318 --> 34:05.119
You know what you could do?

34:05.121 --> 34:07.054
Skip Steve's funeral.

34:07.056 --> 34:09.623
Just skip
the nice speech

34:09.626 --> 34:12.426
about how honor is such
a big part of the job.

34:12.428 --> 34:14.527
How the NYPD appreciates

34:14.530 --> 34:17.431
the sacrifices
made by the families.

34:17.433 --> 34:19.400
You might be able
to get the words out,

34:19.402 --> 34:22.402
but I, for one,
don't want to hear them.

34:22.405 --> 34:26.274
His real family
doesn't want to hear it.

34:26.275 --> 34:28.442
Can you do that for me?

34:34.449 --> 34:36.650
Good-bye, Commissioner.

35:05.416 --> 35:06.589
(door opens)

35:06.590 --> 35:08.790
Frank.

35:12.156 --> 35:13.389
I've got good news.

35:13.391 --> 35:14.924
I could use some.

35:14.926 --> 35:17.593
Corporation counsel reviewed
Steve Tomlin's financials.

35:17.595 --> 35:20.129
He filled out his deferred
compensation papers

35:20.131 --> 35:22.698
but never submitted them,
so they're invalid.

35:22.700 --> 35:26.202
The Staten Island family will
get all the money and benefits.

35:28.172 --> 35:29.639
And how is that good news?

35:29.641 --> 35:32.742
Well, the last thing
this office needs

35:32.744 --> 35:35.077
is legal wrangling
with an irate widow.

35:35.079 --> 35:38.281
Or lurid headlines
about a two-timing cop.

35:38.283 --> 35:40.950
So it's good news
for this office?

35:40.952 --> 35:42.919
What about Marianna
and their baby?

35:42.921 --> 35:44.326
Well, technically,
they're not his family.

35:44.351 --> 35:45.656
Technically?
I don't blame them.

35:45.657 --> 35:49.225
Doesn't take a ring
to make a family.

35:49.227 --> 35:51.160
I tried to give
you an out, Frank.

35:51.162 --> 35:52.895
But you chose
to be mixed up in this.

35:52.897 --> 35:54.630
I'm just telling you
where we are.

35:54.632 --> 35:56.933
On the high moral ground,
apparently.

35:56.935 --> 35:59.502
That's not fair.
None of this is.

35:59.504 --> 36:01.070
That's no excuse
to turn our backs

36:01.072 --> 36:02.839
on a woman with a cop's baby.

36:02.841 --> 36:04.207
Look, if you can

36:04.209 --> 36:06.943
fire a way to help out
both families, I'm all ears.

36:06.945 --> 36:10.012
As far as I see it,
the department's hands are tied.

36:17.020 --> 36:19.322
You really sure
I should be here?

36:19.324 --> 36:22.124
I called your mom to ask her,
but she didn't answer, so...

36:22.126 --> 36:24.794
No, I mean because
I lied to you.

36:24.796 --> 36:26.529
We're good, Nicky.
And I think that Tyler

36:26.531 --> 36:29.065
could really use a friend
right about now.

36:29.067 --> 36:31.033
Tyler. Oh, my God,

36:31.035 --> 36:32.768
I thought you moved.

36:32.770 --> 36:34.170
That's what I told everyone.

36:34.172 --> 36:35.738
So they wouldn't know the truth.

36:35.740 --> 36:38.875
Tyler's mom has been
having some problems.

36:38.877 --> 36:41.644
What do you mean?

36:51.121 --> 36:53.856
First it was prescription drugs.

36:54.892 --> 36:56.792
Then it became other stuff.

36:57.961 --> 37:00.363
Ms. Jeffries disappeared
about a week ago.

37:00.365 --> 37:02.532
Tyler's been out
looking for her.

37:05.202 --> 37:08.571
Why didn't you let my mom
help you? Or my uncle?

37:08.573 --> 37:10.773
Because then you'd
find out, and...

37:10.775 --> 37:12.542
people at school.

37:13.610 --> 37:16.045
(short laugh)
But...

37:16.047 --> 37:17.713
I guess they'll all
find out anyway

37:17.715 --> 37:20.283
when it's in the papers
that she's dead.

37:20.285 --> 37:21.984
Tyler, we don't
know that she is.

37:21.986 --> 37:23.419
Then why can't I find her?

37:23.421 --> 37:25.021
I've looked everywhere.

37:25.023 --> 37:27.156
Because she's been
in the hospital.

37:27.991 --> 37:29.959
Accidental OD.
She's been

37:29.961 --> 37:32.028
a Jane Doe at Bellevue
for a couple days.

37:32.030 --> 37:34.030
Is there any way I can see her?

37:34.032 --> 37:35.765
That's why I'm here.

37:35.767 --> 37:37.667
So you did keep looking for her.

37:40.203 --> 37:42.538
And your uncle is on his
way down from Rhode Island.

37:42.540 --> 37:44.574
You'll stay with him
until your mom gets clean.

37:44.576 --> 37:46.776
Thank you so much.

37:46.778 --> 37:48.544
All of you.

37:48.546 --> 37:50.112
We just did
what she asked.

37:51.248 --> 37:53.049
Come on.

37:58.488 --> 38:00.690
I want a cape.

38:05.429 --> 38:06.729
Ah.

38:06.731 --> 38:10.099
(chuckles)

38:10.101 --> 38:12.301
Cheers.

38:14.071 --> 38:16.272
(exhales)

38:18.442 --> 38:20.643
Yeah.

38:21.311 --> 38:23.346
I need a little help here, Pop.

38:23.348 --> 38:25.381
Is this about
that Tomlin fellow?

38:25.383 --> 38:28.918
His second family
needs to be taken care of.

38:28.920 --> 38:30.286
Wasn't that <i>his</i> job?

38:30.288 --> 38:32.822
Well, he got himself killed
in the line of duty

38:32.824 --> 38:34.490
before he got around to it.

38:36.893 --> 38:38.894
So throw him a 10-13 party.

38:38.896 --> 38:41.030
There is a three-month-old
baby girl

38:41.032 --> 38:42.999
who's gonna grow up
without a father.

38:43.001 --> 38:45.101
And the problem
does not get solved

38:45.103 --> 38:48.638
by some cash
in a cigar box on a bar.

38:48.640 --> 38:49.839
(door shuts)

38:49.841 --> 38:51.073
DANNY:
Where is everyone?

38:51.075 --> 38:52.274
In here.

38:52.276 --> 38:54.377
HENRY (chuckling):
Oh. Are you here

38:54.379 --> 38:58.014
to help your old man
muscle me into pitching in?

38:58.016 --> 39:01.317
If that's what's
going on, I am now.

39:02.619 --> 39:04.854
Come on, Pop.

39:04.856 --> 39:06.589
You're on the board
of the Policeman's Fund.

39:06.591 --> 39:08.457
Yeah, so?

39:08.459 --> 39:10.793
So it may be time to put
some of that influence

39:10.795 --> 39:12.328
to good use, Gramps.

39:15.365 --> 39:19.568
Create a back-pocket pension
for one more widow and orphan.

39:22.406 --> 39:23.706
Old dog, new tricks.

39:23.708 --> 39:25.341
I haven't said yes.

39:25.343 --> 39:27.576
You gonna say no?

39:28.412 --> 39:30.646
(slow grunt)

39:30.648 --> 39:32.415
So what's going on?

39:32.417 --> 39:35.051
I went to see the girlfriend
again to confirm

39:35.053 --> 39:37.753
that Tomlin's wife did in fact
call her as she claimed.

39:37.755 --> 39:38.821
Wait a minute.

39:38.823 --> 39:41.323
The wife called the girlfriend?
The wife

39:41.325 --> 39:43.259
<i>thought</i> she called
the girlfriend.

39:44.461 --> 39:46.829
She found a number
in Tomlin's cell phone.

39:46.831 --> 39:48.064
She called it, thinking it would

39:48.066 --> 39:50.633
be the girlfriend
on the other end.

39:50.635 --> 39:53.202
Tomlin was undercover
in Castillo's gang.

39:53.204 --> 39:56.405
And unfortunately...

39:56.407 --> 39:58.174
(sighs)

39:58.176 --> 40:00.876
She accidentally
called one of them.

40:00.878 --> 40:03.079
Yeah.

40:03.081 --> 40:06.782
It was Tomlin's wife
who blew his cover, Gramps.

40:06.784 --> 40:09.585
Couple days later,
we got a dead cop.

40:09.587 --> 40:12.003
You got to be kidding me.

40:12.028 --> 40:14.028
If I was kidding,
someone would be laughing.

40:14.559 --> 40:16.625
HENRY:
Good Lord.

40:16.627 --> 40:19.628
She loses her husband
and then has to hear this.

40:19.630 --> 40:21.464
It'll kill the woman.

40:24.668 --> 40:27.970
Unless she doesn't hear it.

40:30.273 --> 40:33.876
I can't lie to that woman again.

40:33.878 --> 40:36.512
She has to know.

40:44.821 --> 40:47.022
Commissioner Reagan.

40:49.059 --> 40:51.761
I need to talk to you,
Mrs. Tomlin.

40:51.763 --> 40:54.096
I've said everything
I have to say.

40:54.098 --> 40:56.866
Well,

40:56.868 --> 40:58.968
I'm afraid I haven't.

41:01.772 --> 41:03.773
I'm sorry, I got
nothing for nobody.

41:03.775 --> 41:06.342
I'm burying my
husband tomorrow.

41:08.912 --> 41:11.380
I didn't handle
our meeting very well,

41:11.382 --> 41:14.116
yesterday, and I'm sorry.

41:16.720 --> 41:19.288
But I think...

41:19.290 --> 41:21.457
(deep breath)

41:25.962 --> 41:30.933
Steve would've wanted the NYPD
represented at his service.

41:30.935 --> 41:32.968
I know he would.

41:32.970 --> 41:34.970
And it would be my honor

41:34.972 --> 41:37.406
to do that for him.

41:39.009 --> 41:42.278
You came all the way out
here just to ask me that?

41:46.383 --> 41:48.284
Yes, I did.
