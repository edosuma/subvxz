_

00:11.533 --> 00:13.762
My girlfriend was pregnant
when I was sentenced.

00:13.765 --> 00:15.752
I have a son now.

00:15.754 --> 00:18.512
- _
- Uh, Roy.

00:18.515 --> 00:20.195
We skimmed guns from busts.

00:20.198 --> 00:21.371
You and Whitehead?

00:21.374 --> 00:22.699
Yeah. The weapons we seized

00:22.702 --> 00:24.153
were popular on the street.

00:24.156 --> 00:26.937
- _
- They made the perfect drop gun.

00:26.939 --> 00:28.843
Wait, we need to leave.

00:28.846 --> 00:30.071
Oh, God, you're right.

00:30.073 --> 00:32.339
- _
- Attorney-client privilege.

00:32.342 --> 00:33.788
We can't be listening to this.

02:15.309 --> 02:17.309
Many wondered

02:17.311 --> 02:20.085
why the president was
insisting on taking five goats

02:20.088 --> 02:21.892
to the European summit.

02:21.895 --> 02:23.950
And many European
leaders expressed concern

02:23.953 --> 02:25.491
that coverage of the visiting goats

02:25.493 --> 02:27.203
would upstage the good economic work

02:27.206 --> 02:28.422
done in Zurich.

02:28.425 --> 02:30.234
Republican leaders quickly jumped

02:30.237 --> 02:31.497
to the president's defense,

02:31.499 --> 02:33.325
with Paul Ryan stressing that the press

02:33.327 --> 02:35.140
was making too much of the goats.

02:35.143 --> 02:36.530
"The American people don't care

02:36.533 --> 02:38.156
whether the president brings goats,"

02:38.158 --> 02:39.548
said Ryan's spokesman.

02:39.550 --> 02:41.718
But then it became clear the confusion

02:41.721 --> 02:44.515
was based on a typo in a
White House press release.

02:44.518 --> 02:47.340
The president was going to
the summit with five goals.

02:47.343 --> 02:50.223
There's someone here to see you,
but she doesn't have an appointment.

02:50.226 --> 02:52.605
Diane?

02:52.607 --> 02:54.125
Who is it?

02:54.128 --> 02:56.041
Someone with an immigration problem.

02:56.044 --> 02:57.739
- Hmm.
- Are you all right?

02:57.742 --> 03:00.265
Am I?

03:00.267 --> 03:03.746
I don't know.

03:03.748 --> 03:05.226
You shouldn't watch this anymore.

03:05.228 --> 03:07.881
It's bad for you.

03:07.883 --> 03:10.753
You know, I used to laugh
at the absurdity of the news.

03:10.755 --> 03:12.451
Now I'm all laughed out.

03:12.453 --> 03:14.054
Are you still microdosing?

03:14.057 --> 03:15.149
Nope.

03:15.151 --> 03:16.935
Does that mean you're dosing?

03:18.609 --> 03:20.109
Who's here again?

03:20.112 --> 03:21.786
An immigration case.

03:21.789 --> 03:23.157
She doesn't have an appointment,

03:23.159 --> 03:25.986
but she's being deported in four days.

03:25.988 --> 03:28.815
- Pro bono?
- I think so.

03:28.817 --> 03:32.593
All right. Take down her information.

03:32.596 --> 03:34.555
We'll look into it.

03:34.558 --> 03:36.689
Dominic?

03:36.692 --> 03:38.999
- Dominika.
- Right. Sorry.

03:39.001 --> 03:41.175
- Do you mind following me?
- No.

03:41.177 --> 03:43.525
- You won't follow me?
- No,

03:43.527 --> 03:45.658
I don't mind following you.

03:45.660 --> 03:47.137
Ah.

03:47.139 --> 03:49.575
So, where are you from

03:49.577 --> 03:51.316
- in Russia?
- Taganskaya.

03:51.318 --> 03:52.534
Oh, really?

03:52.536 --> 03:53.970
Yes, you know it?

03:53.972 --> 03:56.103
No. Sorry, that must've
sounded like I did.

03:56.105 --> 03:57.400
I don't know anything about Russia.

03:57.402 --> 03:58.748
Though I think your name is cool.

03:58.751 --> 04:00.679
Like a Russian villain.

04:00.682 --> 04:03.552
So, I'm just going to take
down a few facts first.

04:03.555 --> 04:05.373
You are?

04:05.375 --> 04:06.844
Yes.

04:06.854 --> 04:08.156
Where is Ms. Lockhart?

04:08.159 --> 04:10.116
She asked me to take
down a few facts first.

04:10.119 --> 04:11.553
No, I need to talk to her.

04:11.555 --> 04:14.164
You see, Dominika, Ms.
Lockhart is very busy,

04:14.166 --> 04:15.704
and this is how it always works.

04:15.707 --> 04:18.385
I take down the facts, and she
swoops in for all the glory.

04:18.387 --> 04:19.509
No, but I have no time.

04:19.512 --> 04:21.519
- I'm being deported on Friday.
- Okay.

04:21.522 --> 04:23.350
So we should hurry. Please sit down.

04:28.398 --> 04:30.920
I'm a student at the
University of Chicago.

04:30.922 --> 04:32.879
- On a student visa?
- Yes.

04:32.881 --> 04:34.218
But I was arrested.

04:34.221 --> 04:35.353
For?

04:39.962 --> 04:41.563
I did not do what they say.

04:43.195 --> 04:44.717
"Soliciting." Okay.

04:44.719 --> 04:46.196
And that's why they're deporting you

04:46.198 --> 04:47.589
before your student visa is up?

04:47.591 --> 04:49.156
No. That's what they say.

04:49.158 --> 04:50.810
But?

04:50.812 --> 04:52.290
I want to speak to Ms. Lockhart.

04:52.292 --> 04:54.857
And she wants to speak
to you, but first tell me.

04:54.859 --> 04:57.165
Soliciting's not why
you're being deported?

04:57.168 --> 04:58.560
Then why?

05:03.825 --> 05:06.260
I'm being deported because
I'm one of the women

05:06.262 --> 05:09.047
who was taped with Donald
Trump at the Moscow Ritz.

05:11.680 --> 05:13.876
You know what I'm saying?

05:13.878 --> 05:17.402
The golden shower tape?

05:17.404 --> 05:19.680
I do not like calling it that.

05:21.059 --> 05:22.962
I'll be right back.

05:22.965 --> 05:25.333
Senator Warren's office
released a statement

05:25.336 --> 05:28.063
on the cost of transporting
goats to the European summit,

05:28.066 --> 05:30.937
- claiming $140,000 was too much for...
- Diane?

05:30.939 --> 05:33.635
- I think you should meet with this walk-in.
- Why?

05:33.637 --> 05:35.289
She says she's one of the prostitutes

05:35.291 --> 05:37.117
who peed on Trump in Moscow.

05:37.119 --> 05:39.119
It should have read "five goals"

05:39.121 --> 05:40.990
as opposed to "five goats."

05:40.992 --> 05:43.253
Dominika, hi.

05:43.255 --> 05:45.063
Do you mind coming with me?

05:51.235 --> 05:52.654
Can I get you anything?

05:52.656 --> 05:55.451
Water or directions to the restroom?

05:55.454 --> 05:57.485
That was a joke?

05:57.487 --> 05:59.879
Yes. Sorry.

05:59.881 --> 06:01.641
No, it was good.

06:03.790 --> 06:06.396
Ms. Sokolov, I'm Adrian Boseman.

06:06.399 --> 06:08.826
This is Diane Lockhart.

06:08.829 --> 06:11.365
Julius Cain. Bradley Crawley.

06:11.368 --> 06:12.674
Lena Wechsel.

06:12.676 --> 06:14.981
- I only need to speak to Ms. Lockhart.
- Yes.

06:14.983 --> 06:16.635
Well, you have all of us.

06:16.637 --> 06:18.550
Please, have a seat.

06:18.552 --> 06:20.249
No, I think I will stand.

06:21.251 --> 06:22.730
Marissa, would you...?

06:28.204 --> 06:32.215
So, you want us to help you
with an immigration problem.

06:32.217 --> 06:33.274
I want Diane Lockhart

06:33.277 --> 06:34.993
to help me with an immigration problem.

06:34.996 --> 06:37.092
You, um, you think you're being deported

06:37.095 --> 06:38.509
for political reasons?

06:38.512 --> 06:40.485
Mr. Trump, he doesn't want me here.

06:40.487 --> 06:42.751
He sends me back to
Russia, they will kill me.

06:42.754 --> 06:45.880
- Uh, who will kill you?
- Putin.

06:45.883 --> 06:48.493
Because of this tape? The, uh...

06:48.495 --> 06:50.110
Peepee tape.

06:50.113 --> 06:52.928
So your accusation is
that you were videotaped

06:52.931 --> 06:54.524
urinating for Mr. Trump

06:54.527 --> 06:56.631
- in a Moscow hotel room?
- Suite.

06:56.633 --> 06:57.719
Excuse me?

06:57.721 --> 06:58.891
- Hotel suite.
- Ah.

06:58.894 --> 07:02.920
You urinated on the bed

07:02.923 --> 07:04.970
where Obama slept?

07:04.973 --> 07:07.729
Yes, but I did not know who slept there.

07:07.731 --> 07:10.306
- Then Trump, he peed on us.
- Oh, my God.

07:10.309 --> 07:12.265
- Julius.
- I am not political.

07:12.268 --> 07:14.169
I have no issues with American politics.

07:14.172 --> 07:15.923
I only wish to stay in America.

07:15.926 --> 07:18.149
- I want to stay in school.
- What are you studying?

07:18.152 --> 07:19.349
Hotel management.

07:19.351 --> 07:20.657
Of course.

07:20.660 --> 07:22.670
Dominika, we would like to help you,

07:22.673 --> 07:25.399
but we need a few hours to...

07:25.401 --> 07:27.401
confer first.

07:27.403 --> 07:28.837
Can you come back after lunch?

07:28.839 --> 07:31.579
- Yes, if you say so.
- I do.

07:31.581 --> 07:33.633
Oh, and by the way,

07:33.636 --> 07:35.070
why did you come to me?

07:35.073 --> 07:37.769
To you? In the law school,

07:37.772 --> 07:39.587
I ask a man who I should see.

07:39.589 --> 07:42.242
He says for immigration
problem to see you.

07:42.245 --> 07:43.722
You gave a lecture there.

07:43.724 --> 07:45.027
Oh, good.

07:45.029 --> 07:46.953
Thank you. Marissa?

07:51.209 --> 07:53.253
This is ridiculous.

07:53.255 --> 07:56.067
Since when are we the clearinghouse

07:56.070 --> 07:58.563
for every anti-administration
conspiracy theory?

07:58.566 --> 08:00.150
This is not a conspiracy theory.

08:00.153 --> 08:01.544
This is Steele dossier.

08:01.547 --> 08:04.045
A dossier paid for by
the Clinton campaign.

08:04.048 --> 08:06.005
Diane, what do you think?

08:06.007 --> 08:07.789
We're being set up.

08:07.791 --> 08:09.225
What do you mean?

08:09.227 --> 08:12.359
I never spoke at the
University of Chicago.

08:12.361 --> 08:14.796
I was supposed to... On
immigration matters...

08:14.798 --> 08:17.886
But my partner, Will Gardner,
went there in my stead.

08:17.888 --> 08:20.367
Then who is setting us up?

08:20.369 --> 08:23.109
Veritas.

08:23.111 --> 08:25.633
Project Veritas?

08:25.635 --> 08:27.505
Yes. The O'Keefe thing.

08:27.507 --> 08:29.507
They're trying to videotape us

08:29.509 --> 08:31.102
jumping at this.

08:31.105 --> 08:33.105
- Like The Washington Post.
- Yes.

08:33.107 --> 08:34.750
I think somehow they know

08:34.753 --> 08:38.250
that the Democratic committee
came here looking to start up

08:38.253 --> 08:40.140
impeachment prosecution.

08:40.144 --> 08:41.780
They know that we're coming after Trump.

08:41.784 --> 08:42.780
But not all of us.

08:42.784 --> 08:45.609
And they want a video

08:45.612 --> 08:47.977
of African-American lawyers

08:47.980 --> 08:50.508
jumping at the golden shower tape.

08:50.511 --> 08:52.836
Did you see how she
was clutching her purse?

08:57.191 --> 08:59.362
Ms. Eastman. A call.

08:59.364 --> 09:02.627
I'm going on in two
minutes. Take a message.

09:02.629 --> 09:04.652
I'm here to tell you today,

09:04.655 --> 09:06.631
we are the new Democratic party.

09:06.633 --> 09:08.859
We are organized, and we are prepared.

09:08.862 --> 09:10.906
We are ready. We are prepare...

09:10.909 --> 09:13.073
Golden shower.

09:17.766 --> 09:19.156
Hello, this is Ruth.

09:19.159 --> 09:21.038
I need ten minutes.

09:23.432 --> 09:24.997
Who was it?

09:24.999 --> 09:26.938
I understand. What name did she give?

09:26.941 --> 09:29.261
Dominika Sokolov. A student.

09:29.264 --> 09:31.046
She says she's being deported.

09:31.048 --> 09:32.178
Okay, good.

09:32.180 --> 09:33.364
I think you're right.

09:33.367 --> 09:34.988
It's Project Veritas or someone else.

09:34.991 --> 09:36.530
Someone must've leaked
you being considered

09:36.532 --> 09:37.879
for the impeachment team.

09:37.881 --> 09:39.620
Did she arrive with anyone?

09:39.622 --> 09:41.019
No, she was alone.

09:41.022 --> 09:42.579
Yeah, but she has a purse

09:42.582 --> 09:44.433
with a possible video camera in it.

09:44.436 --> 09:46.147
Good. Are you meeting with her again?

09:46.150 --> 09:48.020
- In two hours.
- Good.

09:48.022 --> 09:50.675
I'm sending my assistant
with a way to record this.

09:50.677 --> 09:52.769
You need to get her on the record

09:52.772 --> 09:55.381
about her immigration
complaint and hiring you.

09:55.384 --> 09:57.188
Then we'll throw our tape online first.

09:57.191 --> 09:59.335
- Understand?
- Yeah.

10:07.998 --> 10:11.304
- I thought you couldn't represent...
- Shh.

10:11.306 --> 10:14.133
We can't represent you.

10:14.135 --> 10:16.352
Our firm represents Rashid,

10:16.354 --> 10:17.797
the cop who supplied the drop gun.

10:17.800 --> 10:19.355
He supplied the drop gun

10:19.357 --> 10:21.923
to Whitehead, the
officer who arrested you.

10:21.925 --> 10:23.708
So we can't use that information

10:23.710 --> 10:25.039
because we only know it

10:25.042 --> 10:26.711
because we're at the same firm,

10:26.713 --> 10:28.234
and he told us as his lawyers.

10:28.236 --> 10:29.527
Attorney-client privilege.

10:29.530 --> 10:32.281
Yes, I've come to know the
strange ways of lawyers.

10:32.284 --> 10:33.409
But what about you?

10:33.412 --> 10:34.652
You can't use the information?

10:34.655 --> 10:36.781
Actually, I quit. I
don't work there anymore,

10:36.784 --> 10:39.724
but they can sue me.

10:39.726 --> 10:41.726
- You quit?
- Yeah.

10:41.728 --> 10:43.728
Why?

10:43.730 --> 10:45.294
I can't work there anymore.

10:45.296 --> 10:47.519
Jay, don't ruin your future for me, man.

10:47.522 --> 10:49.037
I'm not ruining my future.

10:49.039 --> 10:51.170
Okay?

10:51.172 --> 10:53.605
- Tell him the plan.
- Jay, I...

10:57.091 --> 11:00.353
There might be a way around the problem.

11:00.355 --> 11:02.703
We need to hire you a
lawyer to represent you

11:02.705 --> 11:05.581
- who we can, um...
- Can influence.

11:05.584 --> 11:08.802
But it can't be known
we're influencing him,

11:08.805 --> 11:10.319
or we could be disbarred.

11:10.321 --> 11:12.060
You're looking for a front?

11:12.062 --> 11:13.366
Yeah.

11:13.368 --> 11:14.792
Look, Craig,

11:14.795 --> 11:16.281
what happened to your old lawyer?

11:16.284 --> 11:17.718
Who, Gabe?

11:17.720 --> 11:18.850
You want to use Gabe?

11:18.852 --> 11:20.329
We need someone who wouldn't mind

11:20.331 --> 11:22.214
just repeating what we tell him.

11:22.217 --> 11:24.500
And who wouldn't worry
about some of the...

11:24.503 --> 11:26.205
ethical issues.

11:26.207 --> 11:28.688
Well, that's Gabe, yeah.

11:35.534 --> 11:37.346
Okay, what?

11:37.348 --> 11:39.392
Craig Savador has some friends

11:39.394 --> 11:41.524
who want to help with
his upcoming appeal.

11:41.526 --> 11:42.925
He was set up.

11:42.928 --> 11:45.711
A gun was planted on him
by the arresting officer,

11:45.714 --> 11:47.661
which turned an "intent to distribute"

11:47.663 --> 11:49.550
into 15 years.

11:49.553 --> 11:52.027
Now, we, unfortunately,
can't represent Craig...

11:52.030 --> 11:53.485
You guys want something to eat?

11:53.488 --> 11:55.625
- No, thank you.
- No.

11:55.627 --> 11:58.417
You? I got some fried
rice in the refrigerator.

11:58.420 --> 12:00.126
Only take a minute to
heat up in the microwave.

12:00.128 --> 12:01.402
No, we're good. Thanks.

12:01.405 --> 12:03.970
I think fried rice tastes
even better the second day.

12:03.973 --> 12:05.765
Uh, Mr. Kovac, we need you

12:05.768 --> 12:07.420
to act as a front for the defense.

12:07.422 --> 12:08.987
We were on the opposite sides of a suit

12:08.989 --> 12:10.815
a year or two ago, weren't we?

12:10.817 --> 12:12.683
- I don't think so.
- Oh, I think so.

12:12.686 --> 12:15.941
You two look very familiar.

12:15.944 --> 12:18.343
Your firm wasn't very nice to me.

12:18.346 --> 12:20.633
Matter of fact, they
were downright mean.

12:20.636 --> 12:23.550
But I don't hold many grudges.

12:23.553 --> 12:24.857
These, uh, friends of Craig's,

12:24.860 --> 12:26.569
they have enough money
to pay for the appeal?

12:26.571 --> 12:27.832
Your hourly rate.

12:27.834 --> 12:29.113
Guaranteed 18 hours.

12:29.116 --> 12:30.688
And I want first dibs on any lawsuits

12:30.691 --> 12:31.908
against the Chicago PD.

12:31.911 --> 12:32.912
That's up to Craig.

12:40.042 --> 12:42.235
All right. I'll do it.

12:42.238 --> 12:44.326
But I'm not doing it for the money.

12:44.328 --> 12:47.068
And I'm not doing it for Craig.

12:47.070 --> 12:48.983
And I'm not doing it for the glory.

12:48.985 --> 12:51.986
And I'm not doing it because
it's the right thing to do.

12:51.988 --> 12:53.248
And I'm not doing it...

12:53.250 --> 12:54.402
Actually, we have to go.

12:54.405 --> 12:56.230
And I'm not doing it because I believe

12:56.233 --> 12:58.438
the Chicago PD did something
wrong and misbehaved.

12:58.441 --> 12:59.777
No. And I'm not doing it bec...

12:59.779 --> 13:01.256
How many more of these are there?

13:01.258 --> 13:02.780
This is the last one.

13:02.782 --> 13:04.869
And I'm not doing it for the law.

13:04.871 --> 13:06.969
I'm doing it for one reason

13:06.972 --> 13:09.353
and one reason only.

13:10.354 --> 13:11.701
Love.

13:11.703 --> 13:13.703
Okay.

13:13.705 --> 13:15.882
Love for you.

13:16.926 --> 13:18.667
I don't know you.

13:18.670 --> 13:20.315
Yes, and I don't know you.

13:20.318 --> 13:21.491
But the minute you walked in,

13:21.494 --> 13:23.363
it was like a little bird came

13:23.366 --> 13:24.498
into the room.

13:25.972 --> 13:28.588
Okay. Tomorrow in court. 1:30.

13:28.590 --> 13:32.679
You'll be arguing Craig's appeal
from a script we'll give you.

13:32.681 --> 13:34.028
Wear a suit.

13:34.030 --> 13:35.553
Bye.

13:41.618 --> 13:43.385
Oh. Hey.

13:43.387 --> 13:45.474
Hey. What's wrong?

13:45.476 --> 13:47.737
Nothing. No, I was just, uh,
upstairs on another thing.

13:47.739 --> 13:49.565
Thought I'd drop by. Maia.

13:49.568 --> 13:51.848
Colin. Uh, I will...

13:51.851 --> 13:54.657
I will put together
that thing for the guy.

13:54.659 --> 13:56.052
Thanks.

13:57.488 --> 13:59.837
Uh, why were you upstairs?

13:59.839 --> 14:01.664
Uh, uh, n-nothing important.

14:01.666 --> 14:05.581
Just, uh, something came
up on the campaign front,

14:05.583 --> 14:09.150
and I kind of, sort of need
you to do me a massive favor.

14:09.152 --> 14:12.321
I seem to be doing a massive
favor every three days.

14:12.324 --> 14:13.933
This is the last one, I promise.

14:13.936 --> 14:15.682
You didn't have a
meeting upstairs, did you?

14:15.685 --> 14:17.492
- No.
- So honesty is not our best policy

14:17.495 --> 14:19.417
- these days?
- Was it ever?

14:19.420 --> 14:21.335
I didn't want to discuss over the phone,

14:21.338 --> 14:22.772
but I am supposed to be meeting

14:22.774 --> 14:24.745
with the two Democratic power brokers

14:24.748 --> 14:26.124
that will decide whether or not

14:26.126 --> 14:27.714
I replace Barnsdale in the first.

14:27.717 --> 14:30.258
And they would like to meet you, too.

14:30.260 --> 14:32.652
Or three, as it were.

14:36.604 --> 14:40.120
We're ready for you, Ms. Sokolov.

14:40.123 --> 14:42.863
Thank you for returning, Dominika.

14:42.866 --> 14:44.128
Of course.

14:47.147 --> 14:48.276
So...

14:49.417 --> 14:51.192
We have a few questions.

14:51.194 --> 14:52.995
- You will help me?
- We want to.

14:52.998 --> 14:56.153
But it would help to,
um, get a few answers.

14:56.156 --> 14:58.983
When did you move here first?

14:58.985 --> 15:00.419
Last year.

15:00.421 --> 15:06.227
Your Facebook page said
you moved here in 2016.

15:06.230 --> 15:08.122
You looked at my Facebook page?

15:08.124 --> 15:09.917
Yes. Is there

15:09.920 --> 15:11.256
a problem with that?

15:11.258 --> 15:12.980
I don't know. Is there?

15:12.983 --> 15:15.086
We just want to be clear, Ms. Sokolov.

15:15.088 --> 15:17.088
Did you move here last
year or the year before?

15:17.090 --> 15:18.350
Both are true.

15:18.352 --> 15:20.781
I moved to Los Angeles in 2016,

15:20.784 --> 15:23.007
- Chicago, 2017.
- And how did you meet

15:23.009 --> 15:24.225
Donald Trump?

15:24.227 --> 15:26.227
Through a friend at Miss Universe.

15:26.229 --> 15:28.186
- At the after-party.
- And who was this?

15:28.188 --> 15:30.261
Rachelle. Miss Haiti.

15:30.264 --> 15:32.863
And was she the one who was
in the suite with Mr. Trump?

15:32.866 --> 15:34.839
No. No, that was Olga.

15:34.842 --> 15:35.976
Olga who?

15:35.978 --> 15:37.412
I cannot say.

15:37.414 --> 15:39.110
She wants to be uninvolved.

15:39.112 --> 15:41.329
So, we looked into your
background, Dominika,

15:41.331 --> 15:43.244
and there are a few problems.

15:43.246 --> 15:44.854
In 2013,

15:44.856 --> 15:47.248
during the time of the
Miss Universe contest,

15:47.250 --> 15:50.599
you were living and
working in Novosibirsk,

15:50.601 --> 15:53.149
a city 1,700 miles from Moscow.

15:53.152 --> 15:54.255
How do you know this?

15:54.257 --> 15:56.649
Well, we did our own research. So,

15:56.651 --> 15:59.173
how could you be at the Moscow Ritz

15:59.175 --> 16:01.652
at the exact moment you were working as

16:01.655 --> 16:03.785
a hotel charwoman

16:03.788 --> 16:06.425
in a city 1,700 miles away?

16:14.451 --> 16:15.714
Is there something wrong?

16:16.917 --> 16:19.485
You should have just said
you do not wish to help me.

16:19.488 --> 16:21.935
It would have been faster.

16:23.156 --> 16:25.292
Follow her. Follow her.

16:30.753 --> 16:32.901
Bullet dodged.

16:32.904 --> 16:35.605
Mmm.

16:35.608 --> 16:38.043
You wanted it to be true.

16:38.046 --> 16:40.524
No, I was just thinking about Watergate.

16:40.527 --> 16:42.956
How history repeats itself

16:42.958 --> 16:45.611
first as tragedy, second as farce,

16:45.613 --> 16:48.222
third as porn.

17:01.672 --> 17:03.107
- Marissa?
- Yeah, hi.

17:03.109 --> 17:04.238
What's your destination?

17:04.241 --> 17:05.384
Do you see that Acura up there?

17:05.386 --> 17:06.744
The maroon one. Follow it.

17:06.748 --> 17:09.113
- I need a destination.
- That car is your destination.

17:09.115 --> 17:11.230
This isn't a taxi. I need a destination.

17:11.233 --> 17:13.811
I'll give you five stars and
tip you 20% if you follow it.

17:13.815 --> 17:15.292
Please.

17:50.112 --> 17:52.417
She didn't go to Project Veritas.

17:52.419 --> 17:54.703
Uh, I don't know.

17:54.706 --> 17:56.247
It looks like her home.

17:56.249 --> 17:58.031
In Gary.

17:58.033 --> 18:00.860
Yeah. You want me to stay on her?

18:00.862 --> 18:03.123
Okay. Yeah. Bye.

18:18.749 --> 18:20.152
Rachelle,

18:20.155 --> 18:22.031
where did you put the English Breakfast?

18:22.034 --> 18:24.578
- I need a cup of tea.
- It's in the cabinet.

18:24.581 --> 18:27.191
No, it's not in the cabinet.

18:31.440 --> 18:33.213
Who are you?

18:33.216 --> 18:36.373
Oh, I'm-I'm sorry. I thought
this was my friend's apartment.

18:36.376 --> 18:38.838
Oh, Christ. You?

18:38.841 --> 18:40.247
Oh. Hi, Dominika.

18:40.249 --> 18:41.509
What are you doing here?

18:41.511 --> 18:44.121
She was taking a photo of our garbage.

18:44.123 --> 18:47.320
If you don't believe
me, just leave me alone.

18:47.323 --> 18:48.734
Let me go to another firm.

18:48.736 --> 18:51.994
No, we want to. It's
just... It's a wild story.

18:51.997 --> 18:53.562
I can swear to it.

18:53.565 --> 18:55.175
I introduced her to Trump.

18:55.177 --> 18:56.742
Who are you?

18:56.744 --> 18:58.352
Rachelle Dabrezil.

18:58.354 --> 19:00.139
Miss Haiti. Former.

19:01.531 --> 19:03.862
What do you have in
your purse, Dominika?

19:03.865 --> 19:05.229
What do you mean, what do I have?

19:05.231 --> 19:06.536
Is there a camera in there?

19:12.940 --> 19:14.368
Then why were you clutching it?

19:14.370 --> 19:17.023
Because there was money in it.

19:21.508 --> 19:23.334
Why am I here?

19:23.336 --> 19:25.423
Because I think you need to hear this.

19:25.425 --> 19:26.948
After our meeting,

19:26.951 --> 19:28.429
I followed Ms. Sokolov,

19:28.432 --> 19:29.991
and she didn't go to Project Veritas.

19:29.994 --> 19:31.124
She went home.

19:31.126 --> 19:33.033
And did this surprise you?

19:33.036 --> 19:36.838
No. What surprised me is her
roommate is Rachelle Dabrezil,

19:36.841 --> 19:38.663
Miss Haiti from a previous year.

19:38.666 --> 19:41.874
She says she introduced her
to Trump at the after-party.

19:41.876 --> 19:43.674
And there was no camera in her purse.

19:43.677 --> 19:44.937
How much of this is true?

19:44.940 --> 19:46.288
That's the thing.

19:46.291 --> 19:47.694
Her story's checking out.

19:47.697 --> 19:49.447
Miss Haiti?

19:49.449 --> 19:52.101
The same country Trump
called a shithole?

19:52.103 --> 19:53.671
This could be retribution.

19:53.674 --> 19:55.017
Oh, we don't think so.

19:55.019 --> 19:57.759
I thought she lied about my
speaking at the law school.

19:57.761 --> 19:59.358
But I was wrong.

19:59.361 --> 20:01.264
I did go one day that year.

20:01.267 --> 20:02.353
And, yes,

20:02.356 --> 20:04.939
she usually worked in
Novosibirsk on that date,

20:04.942 --> 20:06.507
but she got the weekend off

20:06.509 --> 20:08.596
to see her friend at the
Miss Universe contest.

20:08.598 --> 20:09.869
She was in Moscow.

20:09.872 --> 20:11.772
We think she's telling the truth.

20:13.777 --> 20:17.039
Okay, I'm gonna ask
something of all of you.

20:17.041 --> 20:18.826
Forget it.

20:19.870 --> 20:21.390
Excuse me?

20:21.393 --> 20:22.827
Let it go. Don't tell anyone.

20:22.830 --> 20:23.829
Ms. Eastman,

20:23.831 --> 20:26.242
this is not Project Veritas.

20:26.245 --> 20:28.890
It doesn't matter. It can only
come back to hurt the Democrats.

20:28.893 --> 20:30.314
How do you figure?

20:30.316 --> 20:32.851
Maybe we should talk alone.

20:32.854 --> 20:34.160
Marissa's part of our team.

20:35.364 --> 20:37.408
Let's say your client

20:37.410 --> 20:40.411
talks to reporters about
this golden shower tape.

20:40.413 --> 20:42.761
You might win one news cycle.

20:42.763 --> 20:44.632
You might, if you're lucky.

20:44.634 --> 20:47.983
But the stories will be about
how desperate the Democrats are.

20:47.985 --> 20:50.508
We'll be seen as the
ones scraping bottom,

20:50.510 --> 20:52.335
becoming the dirt-mongers.

20:52.338 --> 20:54.543
Tony Perkins will give
Trump another mulligan.

20:54.546 --> 20:56.340
Jerry Falwell Jr. Will blame the media.

20:56.342 --> 20:58.028
And everyone will move on to the next.

20:58.031 --> 21:00.474
Ms. Eastman, this is not about morality.

21:00.476 --> 21:02.911
This is about the Republicans...

21:02.913 --> 21:07.568
the Russians using
this tape for blackmail.

21:07.570 --> 21:10.397
Yeah. That sounds good.

21:10.399 --> 21:13.008
But we all know it's bullshit.

21:13.010 --> 21:15.273
It's about embarrassing the president,

21:15.276 --> 21:17.317
and it will be a blip.

21:17.319 --> 21:20.242
I know this is hard, but let it go.

21:24.343 --> 21:27.153
When, uh, you were
working on Maia's case,

21:27.155 --> 21:29.547
there was someone you
dealt with at the FBI?

21:29.549 --> 21:30.972
Yes.

21:30.975 --> 21:32.801
Can you set up a meeting with her?

21:32.804 --> 21:34.987
- What about?
- An immigration matter.

21:34.989 --> 21:36.380
You're going after the tape?

21:36.382 --> 21:38.832
No. I am helping a client.

21:38.835 --> 21:41.994
A woman who's gonna
be deported on Friday.

21:41.996 --> 21:44.773
She asked for our help,
and we're offering it.

21:51.058 --> 21:53.617
Yay! Nom, nom, nom.

21:53.620 --> 21:55.782
Well, now I feel stupid
for ordering a large.

21:55.785 --> 21:57.014
I can't eat all this.

21:57.016 --> 21:58.406
Come on. You got to have some.

21:58.408 --> 21:59.842
Oh, no. I'm fine, thank you.

21:59.844 --> 22:01.806
Lucca, you're eating for two.

22:01.809 --> 22:03.368
I got pizza for 20.

22:03.370 --> 22:04.717
No, thank you.

22:04.719 --> 22:06.545
Pardon my reach.

22:06.547 --> 22:08.025
I hope you enjoy.

22:08.027 --> 22:10.446
Why do they say that? "Pardon my reach."

22:10.449 --> 22:13.247
They go to a special
waiter school to learn that?

22:13.249 --> 22:15.119
May I ask you a question, Ms. Starkey?

22:15.121 --> 22:16.948
Mm-hmm. Yeah, sure. Please.

22:18.167 --> 22:20.126
Did you vote for President Trump?

22:24.129 --> 22:25.955
We have something to discuss with you,

22:25.957 --> 22:28.626
but, first, we need
to know your politics.

22:28.629 --> 22:30.852
My politics are none of your business.

22:30.855 --> 22:32.614
I've served under four presidents.

22:32.616 --> 22:34.964
My politics never got in the way.

22:34.966 --> 22:37.750
Then we should go. Thank you.

22:37.752 --> 22:39.617
I didn't vote for Trump.

22:39.620 --> 22:41.141
I didn't vote for Hillary.

22:41.144 --> 22:43.301
I found them equally disgusting.

22:47.109 --> 22:49.696
We need an expedited
"reasonable fear" screening

22:49.699 --> 22:51.720
for a deportation candidate.

22:51.722 --> 22:54.984
Okay. And this person has a
reasonable fear of who, Trump?

22:54.986 --> 22:57.074
Or his or her home country?

22:57.076 --> 22:59.293
Her. And both.

22:59.295 --> 23:03.471
She claims she was involved
in the golden shower tape.

23:06.476 --> 23:07.736
Pardon my reach.

23:07.738 --> 23:10.191
Don't say that ever again!

23:14.316 --> 23:16.484
And you believe her, this client?

23:16.486 --> 23:18.095
We do.

23:18.097 --> 23:19.705
The Jew media

23:19.707 --> 23:22.490
wants us to chase wars
in foreign countries.

23:22.492 --> 23:25.319
The Jew party system
is nothing but a fraud.

23:25.321 --> 23:29.062
The white majority
needs to take control.

23:29.064 --> 23:32.399
It needs to stop being
browbeaten by the Zionist scum

23:32.402 --> 23:34.961
who scold about the Holocaust.

23:34.964 --> 23:38.550
Six million Jews who never died.

23:38.552 --> 23:40.160
It's official?

23:40.162 --> 23:42.039
Yes. No one else made the deadline.

23:42.042 --> 23:44.164
Uh, who is that?

23:44.166 --> 23:45.667
My Republican opposition.

23:45.670 --> 23:48.081
If the Democratic Committee chooses you.

23:48.083 --> 23:49.996
You have a Nazi for an opponent?

23:49.998 --> 23:53.167
Uh... the Republicans
didn't want to sink any money

23:53.170 --> 23:54.735
into a district they know they'll lose,

23:54.738 --> 23:56.611
so Davey Lion slipped in.

23:56.613 --> 23:58.402
He's the only one that
filed by the deadline.

23:58.405 --> 23:59.730
- Well, he'll never win.
- Right.

23:59.733 --> 24:01.312
But he's bringing more
attention to the district

24:01.314 --> 24:02.617
than anyone anticipated.

24:02.619 --> 24:05.054
National news is
already focusing on him.

24:05.056 --> 24:06.261
Is that a bad thing?

24:06.264 --> 24:09.066
Barnsdale got caught groping
a campaign contributor.

24:09.069 --> 24:10.755
The Democratic Committee is looking

24:10.758 --> 24:12.956
for somebody who doesn't
repeat the mistake.

24:12.959 --> 24:15.238
Which, I guess, is where I come in.

24:15.241 --> 24:18.789
Yes. Not only do you help
with the African-American vote,

24:18.792 --> 24:21.680
you show that he won't
grope other women.

24:21.682 --> 24:22.942
Great.

24:22.944 --> 24:24.566
Women have come so far.

24:24.569 --> 24:26.222
Well, thanks for coming on in today.

24:26.225 --> 24:28.425
Please. This won't
take long. Have a seat.

24:28.428 --> 24:29.989
Sorry about the mess.

24:29.992 --> 24:31.383
Cleaner comes every leap year.

24:31.386 --> 24:33.257
Here you go.

24:33.259 --> 24:34.954
All right.

24:34.956 --> 24:38.958
So, I'm just gonna take a couple notes.

24:38.960 --> 24:40.881
It'll help us determine if
there's a reasonable fear

24:40.883 --> 24:41.969
of deportation.

24:41.972 --> 24:44.050
Uh, and I hope that's okay with you.

24:44.052 --> 24:45.886
- Oh, it is.
- Okay, good.

24:45.889 --> 24:47.619
Now, you said that you
and your friend Olga

24:47.621 --> 24:50.187
met Mr. Trump at the
Miss Universe after-party.

24:50.189 --> 24:51.503
Is that correct?

24:51.506 --> 24:53.276
- Olga did not.
- Okay.

24:53.279 --> 24:55.430
Olga did not meet Mr.
Trump at the after-party?

24:55.433 --> 24:57.977
- Yes. Only in the suite.
- Okay.

24:57.979 --> 25:01.750
And what food was served
at the after-party?

25:01.753 --> 25:03.485
What food?

25:03.488 --> 25:06.055
- Yeah.
- You expect her to remember that?

25:06.058 --> 25:07.858
I do.

25:09.323 --> 25:11.077
Hamburgers.

25:11.079 --> 25:13.175
Small hamburgers. Uh, bite-sized.

25:13.178 --> 25:14.836
And how were the waiters dressed?

25:14.839 --> 25:16.169
Black...

25:16.171 --> 25:18.606
with red, white and blue suspenders.

25:19.951 --> 25:22.305
Just to warn you, the clock
tower across the street,

25:22.308 --> 25:24.335
when it rings, it startles
the birds perched there,

25:24.338 --> 25:25.813
and they fly right into my window.

25:25.816 --> 25:27.398
So don't be thrown.

25:27.400 --> 25:29.924
Here they come.

25:33.980 --> 25:36.145
Eh, I guess no birds today.

25:36.147 --> 25:39.888
So in Mr. Trump's suite,
was there a room service?

25:41.501 --> 25:42.683
There they are.

25:44.504 --> 25:45.851
It's awful.

25:45.853 --> 25:48.810
We have a custodian at
the end of the day, just...

25:48.812 --> 25:51.031
shoveling 'em into wheelbarrows.

25:51.034 --> 25:53.511
Anyway...

25:53.513 --> 25:56.949
Oh, was there a room service
table in Mr. Trump's suite?

25:56.951 --> 25:58.646
- No.
- Are you sure?

25:58.648 --> 25:59.952
Yes.

25:59.954 --> 26:01.433
And was there music playing?

26:01.436 --> 26:04.151
- In the suite? No.
- Okay. And were either

26:04.154 --> 26:06.349
- of you wearing a wig?
- Wigs?

26:06.352 --> 26:08.891
Yeah. You or your friend,
Olga, were you wearing wigs?

26:08.894 --> 26:10.355
No.

26:10.358 --> 26:12.225
And you, has your hair color changed?

26:12.227 --> 26:13.956
Mine? No.

26:13.959 --> 26:16.003
And what color is your friend's hair?

26:16.006 --> 26:19.742
- Olga's, it is brown.
- Okay. Good.

26:19.745 --> 26:21.784
Thank you.

26:21.787 --> 26:24.292
I'll get back to you in an hour. Thanks.

26:26.271 --> 26:27.792
That was odd.

26:27.795 --> 26:31.243
Yes. Um... wait here.

26:34.293 --> 26:36.989
- Excuse me, Ms. Starkey.
- Yeah.

26:36.991 --> 26:38.695
You've seen the tape?

26:38.698 --> 26:40.819
I'm sorry, what?

26:40.821 --> 26:42.386
Your questions.

26:42.388 --> 26:44.692
That kind of specificity.

26:44.694 --> 26:46.781
You've seen the golden shower tape?

26:46.784 --> 26:49.480
Well, I haven't seen the tape,

26:49.482 --> 26:51.203
but we have received enough chatter

26:51.206 --> 26:52.309
to know what's in it.

26:52.311 --> 26:53.805
And there were two blonde hookers,

26:53.808 --> 26:55.394
not brunettes.

26:55.397 --> 26:57.617
And Mr. Trump had just
finished in-room dining,

26:57.620 --> 27:00.055
so your client's lying.

27:00.057 --> 27:02.014
Mmm.

27:02.016 --> 27:03.700
What do you need to hear from her

27:03.703 --> 27:05.370
to determine she's not lying?

27:07.205 --> 27:10.021
Her contact in the FSB.

27:10.024 --> 27:12.144
Who set it up?

27:12.147 --> 27:13.634
I cannot say.

27:13.636 --> 27:15.027
She doesn't believe you.

27:15.029 --> 27:17.508
I had no contact with FSB.

27:17.510 --> 27:19.510
That was all Olga, it wasn't me.

27:19.512 --> 27:21.294
Then talk to Olga.

27:21.296 --> 27:22.880
Ask her to come forward.

27:22.883 --> 27:25.649
Seriously, Dominika,

27:25.652 --> 27:27.084
you only have three days.

27:32.220 --> 27:34.046
- We miss you at work.
- Mmm.

27:34.048 --> 27:35.439
You should come back.

27:35.441 --> 27:36.969
- No.
- Why not?

27:36.972 --> 27:39.016
I want to be someplace where it matters.

27:39.019 --> 27:40.508
Maia.

27:40.511 --> 27:42.294
What the hell? Where were you?

27:42.297 --> 27:44.552
Don't be mad at me. I really
meant to be here on time.

27:44.555 --> 27:45.892
- I just...
- We've only got a minute.

27:45.894 --> 27:48.147
- I only need a minute.
- Did you look at the brief we sent you?

27:48.149 --> 27:50.062
I don't need to look at it.
I've got it all right here.

27:50.064 --> 27:51.672
- Oh, Jesus.
- Maia, please.

27:51.674 --> 27:53.021
Don't be disappointed in me.

27:53.023 --> 27:54.726
I just need some positive reinforcement.

27:54.729 --> 27:57.414
Remember, the key is to
get the arrest records.

27:57.417 --> 27:59.637
- Okay?
- You look nice.

27:59.639 --> 28:01.378
Motion denied.

28:01.380 --> 28:03.528
And don't bring me
this kind of crap again.

28:03.531 --> 28:04.833
And I mean it.

28:04.836 --> 28:06.445
What do we have? Next.

28:06.448 --> 28:08.937
The Savador appeal, Your Honor.
Stark Schiff for the people.

28:08.940 --> 28:10.549
Someone here for Savador?

28:10.552 --> 28:13.084
Uh, yes. Um, me, Your Honor.

28:13.087 --> 28:16.781
Gabriel Kovac of Kovac
and Associates, here.

28:16.784 --> 28:18.927
- Whose motion is this?
- It's mine, Your Honor.

28:18.929 --> 28:21.049
Uh, just a sec.

28:21.051 --> 28:23.400
I've got so many,

28:23.402 --> 28:25.718
so many papers here. Just...

28:25.721 --> 28:28.411
I'm getting ready to move
on to another case, Mr. Kovac

28:28.414 --> 28:29.884
of Kovac and Associates.

28:29.886 --> 28:30.929
Please, Your Honor.

28:30.932 --> 28:33.856
Uh. I'm doing my-my best here.

28:33.859 --> 28:35.054
Aha! Here it is.

28:35.057 --> 28:36.976
Uh, the, uh, the prosecution

28:36.979 --> 28:40.083
hasn't released its
arrest records to us.

28:40.086 --> 28:41.853
What arrest records?

28:41.855 --> 28:44.290
Oh, don't play coy with me.

28:44.292 --> 28:48.273
The arrest records...
The arrest records...

28:48.276 --> 28:50.557
- Pass this over to Kovac.
- The arrest records...

28:50.559 --> 28:51.993
Pass it over to Kovac. Go. Go. Go.

28:51.995 --> 28:54.062
Pass it over to Kovac.

28:54.065 --> 28:56.170
Um, a moment, Your Honor.

28:56.173 --> 28:57.242
The arrest records.

28:57.245 --> 28:59.445
Yeah. The arrest records...

29:01.445 --> 29:04.876
of Daniel Whitehead,
the arresting officer,

29:04.878 --> 29:06.390
and another officer,

29:06.393 --> 29:10.390
a Ray-shed Clarkson.

29:12.363 --> 29:14.146
You see, Your Honor?

29:14.148 --> 29:16.324
The government doesn't even
know what to say to that.

29:17.489 --> 29:19.356
Your Honor, Rashid Clarkson

29:19.359 --> 29:21.022
has nothing to do with this case.

29:21.024 --> 29:22.894
That's what they want us to think.

29:22.896 --> 29:24.373
This, this stinks

29:24.375 --> 29:26.375
to high heaven, Your Honor. High heaven.

29:26.377 --> 29:28.257
Yes. We're all impressed, Mr. Kovac.

29:28.260 --> 29:29.629
Motion denied.

29:29.632 --> 29:31.781
- Why?
- Excuse me?

29:31.784 --> 29:34.644
- Why, Your Honor? I asked why.
- Because...

29:34.647 --> 29:37.561
you haven't shown any connection
between the arresting officer

29:37.563 --> 29:38.953
and this other cop.

29:38.955 --> 29:41.173
This other cop, we believe

29:41.175 --> 29:44.718
supplied the gun that
was planted by Whitehaven.

29:44.721 --> 29:46.482
White... whatever.

29:46.485 --> 29:47.832
You believe?

29:47.834 --> 29:49.486
And how do you believe this?

29:49.488 --> 29:51.052
- With great sincerity.
- No, no.

29:51.054 --> 29:53.492
What evidence leads you to this?

29:55.772 --> 29:57.971
Your Honor.

29:57.974 --> 30:00.322
You and I,

30:00.324 --> 30:03.587
we are, we are free men.

30:03.589 --> 30:06.546
But there is another man in jail.

30:06.548 --> 30:08.312
A good man,

30:08.315 --> 30:12.290
who spends his days
carving small objects

30:12.293 --> 30:14.206
that he finds in the prison yard.

30:14.208 --> 30:17.470
Pebbles.

30:17.472 --> 30:19.726
Rocks.

30:19.729 --> 30:23.034
And he carves them into...

30:23.037 --> 30:27.653
sailboats... and small ducks.

30:27.656 --> 30:31.658
And he then sends them to his mother.

30:31.660 --> 30:33.225
His mother. A good woman,

30:33.227 --> 30:37.359
who spends her days doing laundry.

30:37.361 --> 30:39.274
A mother who, um,

30:39.276 --> 30:43.627
cries herself to sleep every night.

30:43.629 --> 30:48.327
And she holds these little
objects close to her.

30:48.329 --> 30:52.940
She holds them, and she... caresses them

30:52.942 --> 30:55.987
because she knows that
she will never caress

30:55.989 --> 30:58.598
her son ever again.

30:58.600 --> 31:00.600
Please.

31:00.602 --> 31:03.255
None of us can live without hope.

31:03.257 --> 31:05.779
Give her hope, Your Honor.

31:05.781 --> 31:08.109
It's up to you.

31:12.222 --> 31:15.006
You're not a very good
lawyer, are you, Mr. Kovac?

31:15.008 --> 31:17.835
No.

31:17.837 --> 31:20.141
That's too bad.

31:20.143 --> 31:22.840
- Motion denied.
- Wait! Wait! Wait. Wait.

31:22.843 --> 31:24.882
I've-I've got one
more thing, Your Honor.

31:24.885 --> 31:26.367
Of course you do.

31:26.370 --> 31:29.454
I am seeking leave

31:29.457 --> 31:32.676
to file an application for a...

31:32.678 --> 31:35.287
federal writ

31:35.289 --> 31:37.463
of habeas corpus,

31:37.465 --> 31:39.683
pursuant to...

31:39.685 --> 31:43.993
43 U.S. Code.

31:46.560 --> 31:48.350
It's meant to determine whether...

31:48.353 --> 31:50.440
I know what it's meant.

31:50.443 --> 31:53.740
You're accusing the state of
holding Mr. Savador illegally?

31:53.743 --> 31:55.089
I am, Your Honor.

31:55.091 --> 31:56.917
J'accuse.

31:56.919 --> 32:01.661
The arrested officer,
Mr., uh, White... forehead,

32:01.663 --> 32:04.272
he has recently been sued,

32:04.274 --> 32:05.839
- civilly...
- Mr. Schiff.

32:05.841 --> 32:07.826
The civil case was settled out of court.

32:07.829 --> 32:10.498
In a massive cover-up,
Your Honor. Massive.

32:10.501 --> 32:14.482
Okay. Okay. I'm granting
leave to file the application.

32:14.485 --> 32:16.334
- Yay!
- I order Mr. Savador

32:16.337 --> 32:18.295
to be brought to this court to, uh,

32:18.298 --> 32:21.332
determine the illegality
of his detention

32:21.335 --> 32:23.350
in the light of recent actions

32:23.353 --> 32:26.859
against his arresting officer. Okay?

32:26.862 --> 32:28.470
I won the case, Your Honor, right?

32:28.472 --> 32:29.907
You want me to say it?

32:29.909 --> 32:31.604
If it's not too much trouble.

32:31.606 --> 32:34.172
Yes. You won.

32:34.174 --> 32:35.826
And they lost.

32:39.444 --> 32:41.183
Well?

32:41.186 --> 32:43.131
- Good job.
- Thank you.

32:43.134 --> 32:45.886
- So, now, about our date.
- Just so you know,

32:45.889 --> 32:48.012
- I am not...
- We are gonna have to wait on it,

32:48.014 --> 32:51.217
'cause I have got to start
working on our defense.

33:00.809 --> 33:02.200
Your friend always this late?

33:02.202 --> 33:03.389
No.

33:03.392 --> 33:04.768
I have to leave in a few minutes.

33:09.601 --> 33:11.097
Wait. What?

33:11.100 --> 33:12.689
Say it again.

33:12.691 --> 33:14.647
They came for her. She's gone.

33:14.649 --> 33:16.388
- Who came for her?
- The INS.

33:16.390 --> 33:18.042
Olga called me, crying, screaming.

33:18.044 --> 33:20.566
They were here, taking
her, deporting her.

33:20.568 --> 33:21.828
Oh, my God.

33:21.830 --> 33:23.743
How did they find out?

33:23.745 --> 33:26.180
I, uh...

33:26.183 --> 33:28.573
Hang up.

33:29.889 --> 33:31.579
Let's not call again.

33:34.800 --> 33:36.930
What's wrong?

33:36.932 --> 33:39.237
Olga's been taken by the INS.

33:39.239 --> 33:40.629
Really? That's terrible.

33:40.631 --> 33:41.718
Did you do this?

33:41.720 --> 33:43.110
What are you, crazy?

33:43.112 --> 33:44.416
No one had her number.

33:44.418 --> 33:46.065
No one knew where she was.

33:46.068 --> 33:48.420
One second.

33:48.422 --> 33:50.465
A delivery just came for you.

33:50.467 --> 33:51.857
Well, put it in my office.

33:51.860 --> 33:53.506
It's from Olga Yermolov.

34:11.553 --> 34:13.505
I'll get the popcorn.

34:23.610 --> 34:25.914
Want me to do it?

34:25.916 --> 34:28.529
No. I will.

35:02.355 --> 35:04.367
Is it?

35:04.370 --> 35:06.087
Uh...

35:06.090 --> 35:07.657
You needed me?

35:10.597 --> 35:12.593
What is it?

35:15.926 --> 35:18.907
Is that what I think it is?

35:18.910 --> 35:21.027
Ugh.

35:30.226 --> 35:31.660
We have to call her.

35:31.663 --> 35:33.408
The FBI?

35:33.411 --> 35:36.673
No. I don't think she's on our side.

35:36.676 --> 35:38.933
Eastman.

35:43.277 --> 35:45.016
I thought we were dropping this.

35:45.019 --> 35:47.150
In fact, I thought I specifically said

35:47.153 --> 35:48.848
- to drop this.
- We did.

35:48.850 --> 35:50.241
This wasn't for you.

35:50.243 --> 35:52.069
This was for our client, Dominika.

35:52.071 --> 35:53.505
This tape was for your client?

35:53.507 --> 35:56.157
Her friend sent it
before she was deported.

35:56.160 --> 35:57.944
Is it real?

35:57.946 --> 35:59.707
You judge.

36:16.007 --> 36:18.050
What do you think?

36:18.053 --> 36:21.881
I can't take three more years of this.

36:21.883 --> 36:24.014
How about seven?

36:24.016 --> 36:26.799
Ugh.

36:26.801 --> 36:28.932
Will you vote for him again?

36:28.934 --> 36:30.996
Depends on who's running.

36:34.983 --> 36:36.699
She's gonna investigate.

36:36.702 --> 36:38.636
She thinks they can use
it against the president?

36:38.639 --> 36:39.986
She's not sure,

36:39.988 --> 36:41.746
but she's gonna find out.

36:48.823 --> 36:50.431
Thanks for doing this, by the way.

36:50.433 --> 36:53.473
Hey, if it keeps a Nazi out of office,

36:53.476 --> 36:55.217
I can act like I love you.

37:00.139 --> 37:02.269
Yeah, we're not really
hand-holding types, are we?

37:02.271 --> 37:04.402
No.

37:04.404 --> 37:06.839
But I don't mind it.

37:06.841 --> 37:08.480
Colin, Lucca.

37:10.439 --> 37:12.439
How are you? Hi, I'm Frank Landau,

37:12.442 --> 37:14.181
chairman of the Cook
County Democratic Party.

37:14.183 --> 37:16.153
Thank you so much for
coming. Come on in.

37:16.155 --> 37:18.372
And we started on
opposite sides of cases,

37:18.374 --> 37:21.898
and then it was just...
opposites attract, I guess.

37:21.900 --> 37:24.422
It's like my wife and I.

37:24.424 --> 37:28.339
She's a blues singer,
and I hate the blues.

37:30.560 --> 37:34.141
Gosh, anyways, that's our life.

37:34.144 --> 37:35.955
So if there's anything else

37:35.957 --> 37:37.827
I can say to allay your fears...

37:37.829 --> 37:40.133
Well, we're really glad you
came along tonight, Lucca.

37:40.135 --> 37:42.876
But our worries really aren't
about your relationship.

37:42.879 --> 37:44.313
You both seem great.

37:44.316 --> 37:45.613
Thank you.

37:45.616 --> 37:47.616
It's about your prosecutorial record.

37:47.619 --> 37:49.099
Excuse me?

37:49.101 --> 37:50.535
At the Justice Department,

37:50.537 --> 37:52.868
a lot of the non-Trump folks resigned,

37:52.871 --> 37:54.495
but you didn't.

37:54.497 --> 37:56.657
Well, I-I didn't want
to leave my department

37:56.660 --> 37:58.032
without any AUSAs.

37:58.035 --> 37:59.544
I cared about my cases.

37:59.546 --> 38:00.980
Yes, your cases.

38:00.982 --> 38:03.722
Your prosecution rate
is quite high. 95%.

38:03.724 --> 38:06.274
- When I go into a case, I try to win.
- Yes.

38:06.277 --> 38:10.252
To the tune of 90%
African-American prosecutions.

38:14.991 --> 38:17.938
That's-that's just because I'm handed

38:17.941 --> 38:21.321
a lot of cases involving
African-American defendants.

38:21.324 --> 38:22.758
No.

38:22.761 --> 38:25.091
Actually, it's not.

38:25.093 --> 38:26.789
We looked over your cases.

38:26.791 --> 38:29.922
You tend to plead out
cases with white defendants

38:29.924 --> 38:32.454
and prosecute cases with
African-American defendants.

38:32.457 --> 38:34.057
Um...

38:34.059 --> 38:38.452
speaking as an African-American
defense attorney with a lot

38:38.454 --> 38:40.551
of African-American clients,

38:40.554 --> 38:43.965
I would say that Colin is
one of the fairer AUSAs.

38:43.968 --> 38:46.269
And yet the statistics disagree.

38:46.272 --> 38:48.337
So you'd rather have a neo-Nazi win?

38:48.340 --> 38:49.680
Oh, no.

38:49.683 --> 38:52.157
Your competition's not Davey Lion.

38:52.160 --> 38:53.641
It's another Democrat,

38:53.643 --> 38:56.261
a businesswoman named Sue Rimes.

38:56.264 --> 38:58.504
And she has no racial entanglements.

38:58.507 --> 39:00.126
Also no accomplishments.

39:00.128 --> 39:02.293
Accomplishments aren't always good.

39:06.178 --> 39:07.743
What?

39:07.745 --> 39:09.427
I'm fucked.

39:09.430 --> 39:11.212
You were sarcastic.

39:11.215 --> 39:12.573
No, Lucca was great.

39:12.575 --> 39:15.098
It's about my prosecutions, not groping.

39:15.100 --> 39:16.704
What's wrong with your prosecutions?

39:16.707 --> 39:18.683
Apparently I'm a racist.

39:20.363 --> 39:21.844
Julius.

39:21.846 --> 39:24.337
- How you doing?
- Hey, Rodney.

39:24.340 --> 39:26.446
How are things at the DOJ?

39:26.449 --> 39:27.893
Fine. How about you?

39:27.895 --> 39:29.677
Still want out of Reddick/Boseman?

39:29.679 --> 39:31.244
Well, sometimes.

39:31.246 --> 39:33.415
See the op-ed in the
Chicago Timestoday?

39:33.418 --> 39:35.248
It doesn't matter what we do.

39:35.250 --> 39:36.790
They see collusion everywhere.

39:36.793 --> 39:39.165
We need more Republican
journalism majors.

39:39.167 --> 39:41.211
What's it matter?
Editors won't hire them.

39:41.213 --> 39:43.300
Uh, latte macchiato, grande.

39:43.302 --> 39:45.606
Hey, um...

39:45.608 --> 39:47.783
heard you guys are causing trouble.

39:47.785 --> 39:49.349
What do you mean?

39:49.351 --> 39:52.222
You have a tape to embarrass Donald J.

39:52.224 --> 39:54.219
Who told you?

39:54.222 --> 39:55.703
Feds.

39:55.705 --> 39:57.923
Let your firm run with
it. It'll embarrass them...

39:57.926 --> 39:59.462
Boseman, Reddick, the whole lot.

39:59.465 --> 40:02.188
But you stay clear of it.

40:02.190 --> 40:05.324
When the dust settles,
we'll bring you on board.

40:11.024 --> 40:13.895
I think the tape may be real.

40:13.898 --> 40:16.090
- Why?
- I was just contacted

40:16.093 --> 40:18.161
by a Republican connected to the Feds.

40:18.163 --> 40:20.225
He was waving me off the tape.

40:20.228 --> 40:21.731
They want us to ignore it.

40:26.258 --> 40:27.823
Are you all right in here?

40:27.825 --> 40:29.999
Yeah. Just relieving my back.

40:30.001 --> 40:31.652
- Ah.
- How was court?

40:31.654 --> 40:33.741
- Motion denied.
- Damn.

40:33.743 --> 40:35.134
But then Kovac moved

40:35.136 --> 40:37.927
to file an application
for habeas corpus,

40:37.930 --> 40:40.390
- and the judge allowed it.
- Seriously?

40:40.393 --> 40:42.302
Yeah. I mean, I was surprised, too.

40:42.305 --> 40:45.694
It's not gonna make a difference
without the Rashid subpoenas.

40:45.697 --> 40:47.436
I know. But, I mean, there's got to be

40:47.439 --> 40:48.963
something else we can do with it.

40:54.493 --> 40:56.279
- Would you help me up? I...
- Oh.

40:56.282 --> 40:58.288
Yeah, I can't. Once I'm...

40:58.290 --> 40:59.637
Come here. Okay.

40:59.639 --> 41:00.856
We need to gather the facts.

41:00.858 --> 41:01.944
It's not about the facts.

41:01.946 --> 41:02.945
They just don't want a man.

41:02.947 --> 41:04.076
You need to make things right

41:04.078 --> 41:05.491
with the African-American community.

41:05.493 --> 41:08.436
- I don't have time to make things right.
- Lucca, tell him.

41:08.439 --> 41:10.482
They just want something
in the short term.

41:10.485 --> 41:12.413
There might be something
you can do in the short term.

41:12.415 --> 41:14.695
- What?
- A wrongly convicted kid.

41:14.697 --> 41:16.232
Someone put there with a drop gun

41:16.235 --> 41:18.917
- from a white cop.
- Someone African-American?

41:18.919 --> 41:21.267
- Yes.
- One's not gonna do it.

41:21.269 --> 41:22.834
It's not enough to
change the percentage.

41:22.836 --> 41:25.883
No, there are 30 cases this
white cop was involved in.

41:28.961 --> 41:30.755
What are we looking at?

41:30.757 --> 41:33.671
The reason the video is a fake.

41:33.673 --> 41:35.542
- This robe?
- Yes.

41:35.544 --> 41:37.501
Well, how can the video be a fake?

41:37.503 --> 41:39.155
We never see Trump's face.

41:39.157 --> 41:41.610
We only see his back and his posture.

41:41.613 --> 41:44.507
There's a cottage industry
in Trump golden shower tapes

41:44.510 --> 41:45.770
in the porn world.

41:45.772 --> 41:46.945
Are you serious?

41:46.947 --> 41:50.121
Yes. They're called porn parodies.

41:50.124 --> 41:52.690
The bathrobes at the
Moscow Ritz-Carlton

41:52.692 --> 41:56.302
in 2013 are ecru with navy blue trim.

41:56.304 --> 41:57.390
Look at the bathrobe

41:57.392 --> 41:59.740
in this blowup from the P.P. tape.

41:59.742 --> 42:01.438
White with gold trim.

42:01.440 --> 42:03.657
This is a faked video.

42:03.659 --> 42:05.429
So drop it.

42:32.897 --> 42:34.972
_

42:48.877 --> 42:50.999
Your Honor, it's me again.

42:51.002 --> 42:53.022
And, uh, this is my client,

42:53.025 --> 42:54.561
Craig Sailorhat.

42:54.564 --> 42:56.710
S-Savador. Craig Savador, man.

42:56.712 --> 42:57.936
Craig Savador.

42:57.939 --> 43:00.663
Yes, I've heard all about
your carving of stones

43:00.666 --> 43:02.144
into small ducks

43:02.147 --> 43:03.975
for your mother, Craig.

43:03.978 --> 43:05.586
- Um, I...
- He's much too humble

43:05.589 --> 43:07.502
to go into that here, Your Honor.

43:07.505 --> 43:09.593
Now, about your writ of habeas corpus...

43:09.596 --> 43:11.561
- How's it going?
- What you'd expect.

43:11.564 --> 43:12.911
How should it be going?

43:12.914 --> 43:15.085
My client's conviction

43:15.088 --> 43:16.686
was a tissue

43:16.689 --> 43:18.340
of lies. A tissue.

43:18.343 --> 43:19.530
Just a second.

43:19.533 --> 43:21.676
Can you use more details, Counselor?

43:21.679 --> 43:24.444
Your Honor, Colin Morrello
stepping in for the prosecution.

43:24.447 --> 43:27.249
Ah. Mr. AUSA.

43:27.252 --> 43:28.548
It's good to have you join us.

43:28.551 --> 43:29.697
Thank you, Your Honor.

43:29.700 --> 43:31.589
Our department is currently reviewing

43:31.599 --> 43:33.798
the tainted arrests of Officer Whitehead

43:33.801 --> 43:36.527
due to recent revelations
of improprieties

43:36.530 --> 43:37.915
in confiscated firearms.

43:37.918 --> 43:39.352
More lies, Your Honor.

43:39.355 --> 43:41.158
Counselor, he's agreeing with you,

43:41.161 --> 43:42.681
so it's best to shut up.

43:44.543 --> 43:49.040
As part of our review, Your Honor,

43:49.043 --> 43:51.173
we ask you to vacate the sentence

43:51.176 --> 43:53.509
of Craig Savador.

43:53.512 --> 43:55.501
Okay, let me get this straight.

43:55.504 --> 43:57.392
The DOJ has no objection

43:57.395 --> 44:00.512
to this court granting
petitioners application

44:00.515 --> 44:03.845
and ordering the immediate
release of Mr. Savador.

44:03.848 --> 44:05.805
None at all, Your Honor.

44:05.808 --> 44:10.000
And we wholeheartedly apologize,

44:10.003 --> 44:11.392
Mr. Savador.

44:11.395 --> 44:13.447
Our department promises

44:13.450 --> 44:16.048
to get to the bottom
of police corruption.

44:16.051 --> 44:18.689
Well, now, I'll grant your appeal, sir.

44:18.692 --> 44:20.697
Mr. Savador,

44:20.700 --> 44:23.476
this court can't give
you back the two years

44:23.479 --> 44:24.870
that you spent incarcerated,

44:24.873 --> 44:27.470
but we can give you back your future.

44:27.473 --> 44:29.734
After processing, you're free to go.

44:31.522 --> 44:34.854
Oh... yes!

44:43.325 --> 44:44.408
Thank you.

44:44.411 --> 44:45.584
Your Honor,

44:45.587 --> 44:47.151
I, uh...

44:47.154 --> 44:51.181
I won that one, right? A-Again.

44:51.184 --> 44:53.445
Yes, Mr. Kovac.

44:53.448 --> 44:56.579
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

44:56.582 --> 44:58.103
Wait, wait, wait.

44:58.106 --> 45:00.324
Where are you going?
Y-Y-You owe me dinner.

45:00.327 --> 45:02.153
Mr. Kovac, I'm not interested.

45:02.156 --> 45:04.618
No, no, no, no, no. Wait.
No, it's o... it's okay.

45:04.621 --> 45:06.012
No, you don't seem to understand.

45:06.015 --> 45:07.423
I don't like men.

45:07.426 --> 45:09.470
I don't, either. I'll...
I'll pick you up at 8:00?

45:09.473 --> 45:11.845
Mr. Kovac, I date women.

45:11.848 --> 45:13.674
Great.

45:13.677 --> 45:16.330
I'll see you at 8:00.

45:16.333 --> 45:18.504
She's wrong.

45:18.506 --> 45:21.915
Excuse me? Ms. Eastman is wrong.

45:21.918 --> 45:24.170
I mean, she's right about
the Moscow Ritz bathrobe,

45:24.173 --> 45:26.809
but she's wrong about
the bathrobe in the photo.

45:26.811 --> 45:28.736
Let it go, Marissa.

45:28.739 --> 45:30.478
No. I can't.

45:30.481 --> 45:32.145
It's not gonna help.

45:32.148 --> 45:34.409
I know, but don't you
want to know the truth?

45:34.412 --> 45:36.064
The truth is out there.

45:36.067 --> 45:39.024
It's not high crimes and
misdemeanors, Marissa.

45:39.027 --> 45:40.723
It's not even a dirty limerick.

45:40.726 --> 45:42.595
It's not gonna make a difference.

45:42.596 --> 45:45.643
So? Don't you want to know?

45:49.081 --> 45:51.153
Eastman was right about the Moscow Ritz

45:51.156 --> 45:53.517
having an ecru with
navy blue trim bathrobe.

45:53.520 --> 45:54.723
I checked online.

45:54.726 --> 45:57.309
But she didn't realize something else.

45:57.312 --> 46:00.045
This is an article
about Trump from 2013.

46:00.048 --> 46:02.527
People say he travels
with his own bathrobe.

46:02.529 --> 46:04.137
Look at the bathrobe he's wearing.

46:04.139 --> 46:07.750
That's his bathrobe.
White with gold trim.

46:07.753 --> 46:10.373
Now look at the bathrobe
from the P.P. tape.

46:13.192 --> 46:15.496
They're the same.

46:15.498 --> 46:16.760
They look it to me.

46:22.025 --> 46:25.331
You know, my father...

46:25.334 --> 46:27.944
was a great man.

46:27.946 --> 46:30.686
He fought corruption
ever day of his life.

46:30.688 --> 46:36.343
He said that it made him stronger.

46:36.345 --> 46:38.546
He once remarked that
that's how you measure

46:38.549 --> 46:41.481
the worth of a man,
by looking at his foes.

46:43.387 --> 46:45.953
Well, I look at our foe,

46:45.956 --> 46:50.618
and I wonder how people will measure us.

46:50.620 --> 46:53.752
We're hoping that a golden shower tape

46:53.754 --> 46:57.800
brings down an idiot.

46:57.802 --> 47:01.499
Not exactly Woodward and Bernstein.

47:01.501 --> 47:04.371
Yes.

47:04.373 --> 47:08.401
But still, it's his bathrobe.

47:12.207 --> 47:15.600
Okay... so...

47:15.602 --> 47:18.168
Dominika has what, 36 hours?

47:19.932 --> 47:21.260
Let's get to it.

47:26.065 --> 47:27.220
Rodney.

47:27.222 --> 47:29.527
Hey, Julius. How are you?

47:29.529 --> 47:31.834
Good. You read that latest memo?

47:31.836 --> 47:34.750
About Nunes? Yeah?
He's a good infighter.

47:34.752 --> 47:37.484
About that thing that, uh, we discussed

47:37.487 --> 47:39.580
the last time... the tape?

47:39.582 --> 47:41.539
Yes.

47:41.541 --> 47:44.063
Our client is going public.

47:44.065 --> 47:46.544
She wants to make a
statement about the tape.

47:46.546 --> 47:48.604
- Why? It's fake.
- Well,

47:48.607 --> 47:50.591
she's got nothing left to lose.

47:50.593 --> 47:52.245
She's gonna be deported.

47:52.247 --> 47:53.986
The FBI have already threatened her.

47:53.988 --> 47:56.249
So, why not make a statement?

47:56.251 --> 47:57.947
When is she saying something?

47:57.949 --> 48:00.514
Tonight. Press conference.

48:00.516 --> 48:03.039
Unless there's something we can do.

48:03.041 --> 48:07.045
There might be. Thanks.

48:13.051 --> 48:15.026
Dominika Sokolov, please.

48:18.621 --> 48:21.448
So, I understand you
have a statement to make

48:21.450 --> 48:22.885
about the video, miss?

48:22.887 --> 48:24.016
Who told you?

48:24.018 --> 48:25.191
We have our ways.

48:25.193 --> 48:26.802
Good job.

48:26.804 --> 48:27.933
Let me start by saying that

48:27.935 --> 48:29.413
the FBI would like to approve

48:29.415 --> 48:31.320
your "reasonable fear" application.

48:31.323 --> 48:35.549
But first, we'd like to
be clear about a few facts.

48:35.551 --> 48:38.117
In 2016, you moved to Los Angeles,

48:38.119 --> 48:41.642
where you shot a porno video
in the San Fernando Valley

48:41.644 --> 48:45.081
on a set built to look
like the Moscow Ritz.

48:45.083 --> 48:47.281
And the man made to look like Trump

48:47.284 --> 48:49.999
was actually a porno actor.

48:50.001 --> 48:52.175
Now, you and the other

48:52.177 --> 48:55.901
porn actress in the tape were paid $200

48:55.904 --> 48:57.295
for your participation.

48:57.298 --> 48:59.068
Now, if everything I just said is true,

48:59.071 --> 49:01.793
please sign here and here,

49:01.795 --> 49:06.015
and we will promptly approve
your "reasonable fear" request.

49:06.017 --> 49:07.712
And if I don't?

49:07.714 --> 49:10.238
Well, then, we can't
promise you anything.

49:13.676 --> 49:15.266
It's up to you.

49:38.005 --> 49:39.787
Good.

49:39.789 --> 49:43.008
And, uh, I'll be
taking this into custody

49:43.010 --> 49:44.282
for safekeeping.

49:44.285 --> 49:47.451
Um, were there any other copies made?

49:47.454 --> 49:49.454
Not to our knowledge.

49:49.457 --> 49:50.873
Good. Good, good, good.

49:50.876 --> 49:53.149
Well... and here we are.

49:53.151 --> 49:55.318
Welcome to America, Ms. Sokolov.

49:55.321 --> 49:57.119
Thank you.
