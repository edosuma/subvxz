<i>ZACH HARMON:
So, uh... what we're gonna do</i>

00:30.965 --> 00:33.067
is we're gonna play back
some of the band's new songs.

00:33.234 --> 00:35.803
There'll be no cameras
allowed in there.

00:35.970 --> 00:36.937
There'll be no video,

00:37.104 --> 00:38.406
no bags in there.

Okay.

00:47.515 --> 00:50.084

01:19.447 --> 01:20.181

01:21.715 --> 01:22.249
Camera
over here.

01:22.383 --> 01:23.451
Hello?
(beeps)

01:29.490 --> 01:31.092
Was there ever a
moment you-you thought

01:31.225 --> 01:32.660
about stopping
with Metallica,

01:32.827 --> 01:34.428
or the whole band
was falling apart?

01:34.562 --> 01:37.331
Was it a kind of a power
struggle between you and him?

01:37.498 --> 01:39.333
REPORTER 3: How did you
manage to solve this crisis?

01:39.500 --> 01:40.768
Where in God's name
are you getting

01:40.901 --> 01:42.103
all this aggression
from on this new album?

01:42.236 --> 01:43.304
Where's it
coming from?

01:43.471 --> 01:45.106
Why did it take so long
to release an album

01:45.239 --> 01:46.273
with the
new songs?

01:46.407 --> 01:48.776
REPORTER 4: After 20
years, is it possible

01:48.909 --> 01:50.344
to retain the fire that,
you know,

01:50.511 --> 01:51.879
you guys once had
at the beginning?

01:52.046 --> 01:53.314
Do you think
the young generation

01:53.481 --> 01:54.715
of met-metal
fans will...

01:54.882 --> 01:56.050
accept the
new album?

01:56.217 --> 01:58.986
85 million records,
<i>22</i> years...

01:59.153 --> 02:02.189

various official releases.

02:02.356 --> 02:04.325

(Hetfield laughs)

02:05.759 --> 02:07.461
Oh, my God.

02:07.595 --> 02:10.163

(cheering, whistling)

03:55.769 --> 03:57.304
After 14 years of head-banging,

03:57.471 --> 04:00.107
Metallica bassist Jason Newsted
has quit the band,

04:00.274 --> 04:02.343
citing “private
and personal reasons

04:02.509 --> 04:04.345
<i>"and the physical damage that
I've done to myself</i>

04:04.511 --> 04:06.814
<i>over the years while playing
the music I love."</i>

04:06.981 --> 04:09.650
Metallica's management had no
comment when asked by MTV News

04:09.817 --> 04:11.518
if there's a replacement waiting
in the wings.

04:11.685 --> 04:12.786
But the band is still scheduled

04:12.953 --> 04:14.588
to begin recording
a new album this spring.

04:14.722 --> 04:17.591
<i>That's the news for now.
Stay tuned for more news...</i>

04:17.725 --> 04:18.926
<i>PHIL TOWLE: I</i> mean, <i>I think
everybody understands</i>

04:19.059 --> 04:20.995
<i>the concept of
trusting instincts.</i>

04:21.161 --> 04:22.663
That's getting to a place where

04:22.830 --> 04:25.833
you don't let egos and let...

04:26.000 --> 04:27.635
stuff get in the way of...

04:27.801 --> 04:28.969
artistic expression.

04:29.136 --> 04:30.004
<i>You know?</i>

04:30.170 --> 04:31.372
<i>So, I mean, this...</i>

04:31.538 --> 04:32.973
<i>I mean, do you want to say
any more about that?</i>

04:33.140 --> 04:34.141
<i>'Cause, I mean, I think
everybody understands that...</i>

04:34.308 --> 04:35.376
<i>I met Metallica through</i>

04:35.542 --> 04:38.379
<i>Q-Prime Management
after having seen me</i>

04:38.545 --> 04:39.680
<i>work with another
band of theirs.</i>

04:39.847 --> 04:40.681
<i>When they called and said</i>

04:40.848 --> 04:41.815
<i>that Metallica...</i>

04:41.982 --> 04:43.484
<i>with Jason, uh,</i>

04:43.651 --> 04:46.487
<i>announcing that he was
exiting the group...</i>

04:46.654 --> 04:47.855
<i>needed to take a look at itself</i>

04:48.022 --> 04:49.356
<i>and say, "Well,
what's going on here?</i>

04:49.523 --> 04:51.859
<i>We've lost touch with our
personal relationships."</i>

04:52.026 --> 04:54.228
And face some of the issues that

04:54.395 --> 04:58.632
I think Q-Prime felt
that they were headed for.

04:58.766 --> 05:00.167
You know, we haven't
really worked together

05:00.334 --> 05:01.802
for almost nine months.

05:01.935 --> 05:05.706
When we were talking a couple
of days ago about whether...

05:05.873 --> 05:07.508
you know, if we wanted
to do this film or not...

05:07.675 --> 05:10.044
I was wondering if

05:10.210 --> 05:12.513
having these guys in here...

05:12.680 --> 05:13.714
would affect that.

05:13.881 --> 05:15.249
Yeah. 'Cause I'm just...

05:15.416 --> 05:16.717
...there's an intimacy
that you get

05:16.884 --> 05:19.486
when it's just a few
people in the room

05:19.620 --> 05:21.655
and I'm just wondering if
that's going to get lost.

05:21.789 --> 05:24.325
If we're gonna go back to
sort of, like,

05:24.458 --> 05:26.026
battling each other

05:26.193 --> 05:28.028
and trying to be,
like, all strong and...

05:28.195 --> 05:29.196
What intimacy?

05:29.363 --> 05:30.331
What the fuck are you
talking about?

05:30.464 --> 05:32.166
(laughs)

05:32.299 --> 05:34.034
TOWLE:
I think, to me,

05:34.201 --> 05:35.569
it's not going to be
a matter of whether

05:35.736 --> 05:37.604
the cameras are in play,

05:37.771 --> 05:39.039
but whether or not

05:39.206 --> 05:40.207
you guys are free enough

05:40.374 --> 05:43.444
to risk being seen
by other people.

05:50.217 --> 05:52.186
(intro playing)

06:08.769 --> 06:11.472
HARMON:
We're here, uh, in the Presidio

06:11.638 --> 06:13.207
in San Francisco,

06:13.340 --> 06:15.275
and this is going
to be the location

06:15.442 --> 06:18.545
where Metallica is gonna start
recording their next album.

06:18.679 --> 06:21.415
<i>BOB ROCK". We decided that we
didn't want to go back</i>

06:21.582 --> 06:23.917
<i>into a studio again
and do kind of like</i>

06:24.084 --> 06:25.419
<i>the same thing
we had done before.</i>

06:25.586 --> 06:26.987
We had to kind of...

06:27.154 --> 06:28.389
change things up.

06:28.522 --> 06:30.257
And this is one of the things
that we talked about,

06:30.424 --> 06:32.426
<i>was to go into a space</i>

06:32.593 --> 06:33.761
<i>that's not a studio,</i>

06:33.927 --> 06:35.329
<i>bring in kind of like
a portable studio,</i>

06:35.496 --> 06:36.330
<i>or a makeshift studio...</i>

06:36.497 --> 06:37.631
That's good.

06:37.798 --> 06:40.401
...and basically make
the situation uncomfortable.

06:40.534 --> 06:42.169
<i>HARMON: You know, don't buy
new furniture,</i>

06:42.336 --> 06:43.303
<i>don't paint the walls.</i>

06:43.470 --> 06:44.438
<i>Don't do anything.</i>

06:44.605 --> 06:46.006
<i>Just keep it Spartan,
keep it crude.</i>

06:47.608 --> 06:49.176
<i>They're such a success
that you can get comfortable.</i>

06:49.343 --> 06:50.944
<i>I don't think they want
to be comfortable.</i>

06:51.111 --> 06:52.980
Well, there's definitely
a vibe in here.

06:53.147 --> 06:54.448
They've got a lot of attitude
and I think

06:54.615 --> 06:56.650
they want it to come out
on this next album.

06:59.286 --> 07:00.654
How did you approach
this record differently?

07:00.821 --> 07:01.855
I mean, did you
talk about things,

07:02.022 --> 07:03.123
did you have ideas,
key words,

07:03.290 --> 07:04.491
things like that
that you wanted to put across

07:04.658 --> 07:05.692
before you
actually started

07:05.859 --> 07:07.694
putting the whole
thing together?

07:07.861 --> 07:09.263
Well, ego was
a big one.

07:09.396 --> 07:11.198
Uh, coming in here

07:11.365 --> 07:13.267
and not bringing
a riff,

07:13.400 --> 07:14.368
not bringing
a song,

07:14.535 --> 07:16.203
not bringing a title.
Nothing.

07:16.370 --> 07:18.305
Uh, me and James

07:18.472 --> 07:20.340
did not meet
somewhere else

07:20.507 --> 07:22.810
and come in here
with material.

07:22.976 --> 07:24.511
With songs.
With music.

07:24.678 --> 07:26.880
This time, we all got in a room

07:27.047 --> 07:28.348
and just started playing.

07:28.515 --> 07:29.683
And that's how we wrote songs.

07:29.850 --> 07:32.619
(playing a riff)

07:34.221 --> 07:37.057
<i>BOB ROCK: The idea is,
it should sound like</i>

07:37.224 --> 07:39.526
a band getting together in
a garage for the first time.

07:39.693 --> 07:41.395

07:41.562 --> 07:43.330

<i>Just go off and meditate
in the wind, you know?</i>

08:11.024 --> 08:12.359
<i>As corny as it sounds,
it-it works,</i>

08:12.526 --> 08:13.894
<i>and it feels good.
It's a good way to...</i>

08:14.061 --> 08:15.929
<i>just let the weight
of the world off</i>

08:16.096 --> 08:18.665
<i>every once in a while.</i>

08:18.799 --> 08:20.667
<i>It is it is kind of
strange being...</i>

08:20.801 --> 08:23.770
you know, like a famous guy.

08:23.937 --> 08:25.906
You know.

08:28.308 --> 08:29.877
This is... this is part of me

08:30.043 --> 08:31.378
that's trying to be unfamous,
I guess.

08:31.545 --> 08:35.883
<i>But it's also
go-against-the-rules attitude.</i>

08:36.049 --> 08:37.384
<i>You know, is this
some big pose?</i>

08:37.551 --> 08:39.352
I mean, yes, this is a pose.

08:39.486 --> 08:40.888
I mean, am I driving
down the street

08:41.054 --> 08:42.356
to not get noticed
in this thing?

08:42.489 --> 08:44.725
<i>I mean, rebellious is
kind of what this says,</i>

08:44.892 --> 08:46.727

10:05.806 --> 10:08.008
another 20 strokes

10:08.175 --> 10:09.810
up in that black area up there
where it's...

10:09.977 --> 10:11.278
where it's kind of bare?

10:11.411 --> 10:12.879
Where are the starting points
and where are the end points?

10:47.948 --> 10:49.249
(both singing riff)
HAMMETT: Yeah.

10:49.416 --> 10:51.585
(all playing the riff)

11:06.299 --> 11:08.168
(seagull squawks)

11:08.301 --> 11:09.736
HAMMETT:
<i>In</i> nine days,

11:09.903 --> 11:13.206
it'll be my two-year
anniversary of surfing.

11:13.373 --> 11:16.743
<i>It's taken the place of a lot
of bad things in my life.</i>

11:16.910 --> 11:18.445
<i>So I-l basically</i>

11:18.612 --> 11:21.048
<i>stopped doing the drugs
that I was doing</i>

11:21.214 --> 11:23.950
<i>and, uh... cut way back
on my drinking.</i>

11:24.117 --> 11:26.053
You can't surf
when you're hung over.

11:26.219 --> 11:28.355
You can't surf if you've
been up all night...

11:28.488 --> 11:30.357
well, at least I can't.
(laughs)

11:32.659 --> 11:34.061
<i>There's a-a sort of</i>

11:34.227 --> 11:37.064
<i>individualism, also,
about surfing that I like.</i>

11:37.230 --> 11:38.298
<i>I mean...</i>

11:38.465 --> 11:40.400
when it...
when it's your moment, man,

11:40.567 --> 11:42.569
that's your moment
and yours alone.

11:42.736 --> 11:44.771
<i>And no one can help you.</i>

11:44.938 --> 11:45.906

<i>ULRICH:
For all intents and purposes,</i>

11:54.448 --> 11:55.982
<i>we-we go into this record</i>

11:56.149 --> 11:57.751
<i>completely equal.</i>

11:57.918 --> 11:59.653
Everybody contributing

11:59.820 --> 12:01.555
just as much on the lyric front

12:01.688 --> 12:04.624
as James contributing
with drum parts and...

12:04.791 --> 12:06.293
As soon as you started
talking about that,

12:06.460 --> 12:08.061
I just, like...

12:08.195 --> 12:09.429
(laughs)
HETFIELD: Yeah. Yeah.

12:09.596 --> 12:10.764
You flash back now?

12:10.931 --> 12:11.965
(laughs)
Well...

12:12.132 --> 12:14.468
You want to hear
it with vocals?

12:14.634 --> 12:15.969
BOB ROCK: I said...
Go sing it.

12:16.136 --> 12:19.005
<i>ROCK". You guys had some rules
about that before.</i>

12:19.172 --> 12:21.007
Quite frankly,
I don't give a fuck.

12:21.174 --> 12:22.943
I'm tired of arguing.

12:23.110 --> 12:24.778
<i>ROCK". You couldn't talk
about his lyrics,</i>

12:24.945 --> 12:27.280
<i>therefore, he couldn't talk
about your drumming.</i>

12:27.447 --> 12:28.448
<i>ULRICH:
Right. (laughs)</i>

12:28.615 --> 12:29.616
ROCK: Do you know
what I mean? And...

12:29.783 --> 12:31.985
you and him did the solos...
(Ulrich laughs)

12:32.152 --> 12:33.987
...so you weren't allowed
to comment on the solos.

12:34.154 --> 12:35.589
Do you know
what I mean?

12:35.722 --> 12:37.124
There was, like, rules.
HETFIELD: Oh, definitely.

12:37.290 --> 12:38.258
Are you telling me that...

12:38.391 --> 12:40.193
that those boundaries
are gone now?

12:40.360 --> 12:42.696
(all chuckle)

12:45.532 --> 12:47.868
<i>ULRICH:
In the past, what we did was</i>

12:48.034 --> 12:50.003
<i>started with a bunch of ideas</i>

12:50.170 --> 12:52.005
<i>existing on tape
from everybody.</i>

12:52.172 --> 12:53.507
<i>Then me and James
would sit down</i>

12:53.673 --> 12:55.175
<i>and turn those ideas into songs</i>

12:55.342 --> 12:56.977
and then we would tell
the rest of the band

12:57.144 --> 12:59.312
what to play and when to play
and how to play it.

12:59.479 --> 13:00.647
<i>There was never any...</i>

13:00.814 --> 13:02.215
<i>just other ways of doing it.</i>

13:02.382 --> 13:03.984
<i>HETFIELD:
You know, it's just</i>

13:04.151 --> 13:06.987
<i>a whole new thing for me.</i>

13:07.154 --> 13:10.190
<i>You know, writing
in front of everybody...</i>

13:10.357 --> 13:12.225
<i>'cause I've always just gone
into my own head</i>

13:12.392 --> 13:13.860
<i>and wrote stuff down</i>

13:14.027 --> 13:15.562
<i>instead of taking
things from outside</i>

13:15.729 --> 13:17.697
<i>and putting them down.</i>

13:19.733 --> 13:21.034
ROCK: You know,
I was thinking this is like,

13:21.201 --> 13:23.203
"these are the hands
that da-da-da-da,

13:23.370 --> 13:25.338
this is the face that
da-da-da-da,"

13:25.505 --> 13:26.473
so it's like...

13:26.606 --> 13:28.141
Building a Frankenstein
or something?

13:28.275 --> 13:29.376
Yeah.
Pretty much.

13:29.543 --> 13:30.377
Building what?

13:30.544 --> 13:31.678
A Frankenstein.

13:31.845 --> 13:33.413
This is the top of my
head that's flat...

13:33.580 --> 13:35.415

13:41.354 --> 13:43.056

13:45.192 --> 13:46.226
<i>And it's inspiring to me.</i>

13:46.393 --> 13:48.562
Now I can
further express myself

13:48.728 --> 13:50.197
with these lyrics,
now that, you know,

13:50.363 --> 13:53.934
James has opened that door

13:54.100 --> 13:55.068
This is "clay," right?

13:55.235 --> 13:56.069

Not "clam"?

17:32.786 --> 17:34.754
Is bear edible?
They were no good to eat.

17:34.921 --> 17:37.390
That freaked me out when they
didn't take any meat, you know.

17:37.524 --> 17:39.426
They have been hibernating
for three months,

17:39.592 --> 17:41.327
so they haven't pissed
or shit or nothing, so it's...

17:41.494 --> 17:43.463

Yeah.

17:43.630 --> 17:46.566

20:36.436 --> 20:38.104
That's very good.

20:38.271 --> 20:40.406
...you know, their plate is
filled with many, many things.

20:40.540 --> 20:42.609
And music is
just one of the things.

20:42.775 --> 20:43.610
Say, "Bye, James."

20:43.776 --> 20:45.745
Bye, James.
Bye, buddy.

20:45.878 --> 20:49.449
<i>I chose to not have children
and do those kind of things.</i>

20:49.616 --> 20:52.452
<i>My music... yeah,
that's my children, you know?</i>

20:52.619 --> 20:54.754
Daddy's gonna stay and work
for a little while.

20:54.887 --> 20:57.991
Yeah, but since I decided
to do it with music,

20:58.157 --> 21:00.827
then that's what I have
to fill my time with.

21:05.398 --> 21:07.800
<i>Echobrain is
one of the projects</i>

21:07.967 --> 21:09.969
<i>that I've been
working on for years.</i>

21:10.136 --> 21:12.338
<i>And now it's come to fruition.</i>

21:12.505 --> 21:14.340
<i>And then when it comes
to the time</i>

21:14.507 --> 21:16.643
<i>where my main cat James</i>

21:16.809 --> 21:19.212
<i>tells me that,</i>

21:19.379 --> 21:21.981
you know, basically
he couldn't be in a band with me

21:22.148 --> 21:23.316
if I did the...
took this other project

21:23.483 --> 21:26.052
to this level.

21:26.219 --> 21:28.554
And after 15 years
of working together

21:28.721 --> 21:32.392
and go on busses
and you know the stories, man.

21:32.558 --> 21:34.193
<i>There was no way
that this thing</i>

21:34.360 --> 21:35.795
<i>that I was doing could affect</i>

21:35.928 --> 21:39.332
<i>the monster of Metallica.
I just don't see how it could.</i>

21:39.499 --> 21:41.668
<i>And so in saying things
like that, I-l couldn't</i>

21:41.834 --> 21:45.038
accept that kind of, urn...

21:45.204 --> 21:47.040
limited...

21:47.206 --> 21:49.542
acceptance.

21:49.709 --> 21:52.178
I also know that this
relationship is not over.

21:52.345 --> 21:53.746
You know, he'll-he'll co...

21:53.913 --> 21:55.348
it'll come around again
at some point.

21:55.515 --> 21:56.683
You guys'll make contact.

21:56.849 --> 21:57.717
<i>NEWSTED:
At that time,</i>

21:57.884 --> 21:58.918
<i>the manager suggested that</i>

21:59.085 --> 22:01.187
<i>we have a psychotherapist
come in.</i>

22:01.354 --> 22:03.990
<i>A man that meets

22:14.600 --> 22:16.536
<i>And, uh...</i>

22:16.703 --> 22:19.672
I actually said
I think that this is

22:19.806 --> 22:22.575
really fucking lame...

22:22.742 --> 22:24.577
and weak

22:24.744 --> 22:27.613
that we cannot
get together-- us...

22:27.780 --> 22:29.749
look... we... the biggest

22:29.916 --> 22:32.719
heavy band of all time...

22:32.885 --> 22:34.554
and the things
we've been through

22:34.721 --> 22:35.922
and decisions we've made

22:36.089 --> 22:39.058
about squillions of dollars
and squillions of people.

22:39.225 --> 22:41.527
(stammers)
And this?

22:41.661 --> 22:43.629
We can't get over this?

22:47.934 --> 22:50.236
MAN: <i>Was it more than
just the Echobrain thing?</i>

22:50.403 --> 22:54.107
<i>'Cause that's, like, you know,
what has been discussed.</i>

22:54.273 --> 22:56.075
<i>HETFIELD: He felt like
he wasn't free enough</i>

22:56.242 --> 22:58.578
<i>to do what he needed to do,</i>

22:58.745 --> 23:01.481
uh, since he wasn't getting

23:01.647 --> 23:04.083
his creativity out
enough in Metallica.

23:04.250 --> 23:06.085
He needed to get it
out somewhere else.

23:06.252 --> 23:08.755
And I totally
understand that now.

23:08.921 --> 23:11.824
And, um...

23:11.991 --> 23:15.595
on my side of that was

23:15.762 --> 23:19.565
I didn't want him to enjoy
that more than Metallica.

23:19.699 --> 23:23.269
I didn't want anyone
to leave Metallica.

23:23.436 --> 23:25.338
I didn't want to feel

23:25.505 --> 23:27.774
that we weren't enough

23:27.940 --> 23:29.909
or something like that.

23:32.011 --> 23:34.414
And it was through my...

23:34.547 --> 23:38.117
Oh, I guess the way
I learned how to love things

23:38.284 --> 23:40.119
was just to choke them to death.

23:40.286 --> 23:41.687
(chuckles)
You know?

23:41.854 --> 23:44.457
Don't go anywhere.
Don't leave.

23:44.624 --> 23:46.426
You know?
You have to stay here.

24:10.716 --> 24:12.618
Okay.

24:12.752 --> 24:15.054
I need a pen.

24:15.221 --> 24:16.856
None of this pencil shit.

24:17.023 --> 24:18.024
<i>Check it out, man.</i>

24:18.191 --> 24:19.158
Can't even fucking
spell it right.

24:19.325 --> 24:20.393
"Metllica"

24:20.560 --> 24:22.161
We've only been
together 20 years.

24:22.328 --> 24:24.297
(both imitating drum beats)

24:44.383 --> 24:46.552
<i>I feel guilty</i>

24:46.719 --> 24:49.522
<i>that I'm not inspired
all the time.</i>

24:49.689 --> 24:51.424
You know? Especially
when everyone else is.

24:51.591 --> 24:53.993
It's, like, okay.

24:54.126 --> 24:56.596
We-we kind of get to the point
where the song is looped twice

24:56.762 --> 24:58.831
in the Pro Tools and I know

24:58.965 --> 25:01.200
Bob's gonna hit me up for some

25:01.367 --> 25:03.503
kind of lyric ideas.
Oh, shit.

25:03.636 --> 25:06.072
I was, like,
dreading the whole process.

25:06.239 --> 25:08.875
It's like...
why are you dreading it?

25:09.041 --> 25:10.209
Why don't you just...?

25:10.376 --> 25:11.777
TOWLE: Well, you're dreading
it because of what?

25:11.944 --> 25:13.045
Now, let's get to the fear.

25:13.212 --> 25:14.547
Well, because
I didn't have anything or...

25:14.714 --> 25:15.882
And so if you didn't
have anything...

25:16.048 --> 25:17.750
...wasn't inspired enough
to have something or..

25:17.917 --> 25:19.619
Or letting down the team... And
if you didn't have anything?

25:19.785 --> 25:21.687
Or some vibe like that.

I'm just trying to do
something different.

29:41.213 --> 29:42.948
I mean, I'm...

29:43.082 --> 29:46.018
I'm used to having
the drummer do the...

29:46.185 --> 29:47.453
beat part.

29:49.755 --> 29:51.056
ULRICH:
Urn...

29:51.223 --> 29:54.460
what I'm hearing is...

29:56.729 --> 29:58.697
Gotta choose my words
carefully here.

30:01.033 --> 30:03.002
Urn...

30:03.169 --> 30:04.470
it's pretty straightforward.

30:04.603 --> 30:07.006
And the guitar
shit, it's...

30:07.173 --> 30:08.741
you know, it's
a little stock.

30:08.908 --> 30:10.176
So I started trying to

30:10.342 --> 30:12.678
introduce some kind of
edge to it, from the drums.

30:12.845 --> 30:14.847
HETFIELD: Those things
we throw out to each other

30:15.014 --> 30:16.182
are complete bullshit.

30:16.348 --> 30:17.817
You know?

30:17.950 --> 30:19.018
"It sounds too stock.

30:19.185 --> 30:20.352
It sounds too normal to me."

30:20.519 --> 30:22.488
That... I mean...

30:23.856 --> 30:25.257
Do you know what I mean?

30:25.424 --> 30:27.059
You're saying this shit... so...

30:27.226 --> 30:28.661
you can get your point across

30:28.794 --> 30:30.196
about doing a drum beat.

30:30.362 --> 30:31.897
I mean...

30:32.064 --> 30:33.532
you know,
it doesn't hold any water.

30:33.699 --> 30:34.867
ULRICH:

30:35.034 --> 30:35.868
HETFIELD:
It doesn't!

30:36.035 --> 30:37.269
I think it's fucking stock!

30:37.436 --> 30:39.538
What... which part of that
is unclear to you?

30:39.705 --> 30:42.074
I think it sounds stock
to my ears.

30:42.241 --> 30:44.210
I mean, do you want me
to write it down?

30:45.578 --> 30:46.779
I think... HETFIELD: Oh,
yeah, please write it down.

30:46.946 --> 30:48.180
...It feels stock, okay?
HETFIELD: I can't hear you.

30:48.314 --> 30:49.949
So I... HETFIELD:
No, when you say...

30:50.115 --> 30:51.617
you're telling me what
to play, right now.

30:51.784 --> 30:54.220
You're telling me, "You should
play with what's Kirk's doing,"

30:54.386 --> 30:55.588
and I'm telling you it's stock.

30:55.754 --> 30:57.756
Dude... fine.

30:57.923 --> 30:59.091
You know what, you guys?

30:59.258 --> 31:00.392
Why don't we
just go in there

31:00.559 --> 31:01.627
and just hammer
it out, all right,

31:01.794 --> 31:03.963
instead of hammering
on each other?

31:04.129 --> 31:05.931

and we're not going to get

31:06.098 --> 31:08.234

I don't want to pick a fight.

31:10.603 --> 31:11.971
This is... it's so silly.

31:12.137 --> 31:13.138
You're just sitting there going,

31:13.305 --> 31:14.907
"I'm in a really
pissy mood, and..."

31:15.074 --> 31:16.575
HETFIELD:
And I fuckin' told you

31:16.742 --> 31:18.077
straight up that I was.

31:18.244 --> 31:19.912
Right. And what are
you trying to do?

31:20.079 --> 31:21.580
I'm not trying to
do fuckin' shit!

31:21.747 --> 31:22.581
You're just sitting here

31:22.748 --> 31:24.717
being a complete dick.

31:26.252 --> 31:28.254

helping matters.

31:28.420 --> 31:29.955
You're really good at that.

31:30.122 --> 31:31.490
I was straight up with you,

31:31.657 --> 31:33.459
and I told you
I'm in a shit mood!

31:33.626 --> 31:34.927
And what have you been doing?

31:35.094 --> 31:36.996
Fuckin' picking at me all night.

31:37.162 --> 31:38.464
Come on, guys.

31:38.631 --> 31:40.099
We've got better things to do.

31:40.266 --> 31:41.300
Right?
HETFIELD: Yeah, <i>I</i> do.

31:41.467 --> 31:42.501
<i>.I do.</i>

32:02.488 --> 32:04.790
Metallica front man
James Hetfield

32:04.957 --> 32:06.792

a rehabilitation facility

32:06.959 --> 32:08.794
to undergo treatment
for alcoholism

32:08.961 --> 32:09.962
and other undisclosed
addictions.

<i>posted on Metallica's

32:13.632 --> 32:14.800

<i>TORBEN ULRICH: I think it's easy
to see that, in those days,</i>

33:11.557 --> 33:13.192
<i>Metallica brought a kind of</i>

33:13.359 --> 33:15.928
<i>physicality to rock 'n' roll.</i>

33:17.363 --> 33:20.366
Let's say the Beatles,
the Rolling Stones,

33:20.532 --> 33:22.034
you know, and all that

33:22.201 --> 33:23.669
inspired some of the British

33:23.802 --> 33:25.838
rock music that then
developed after that.

33:25.971 --> 33:28.941
And, let's say,
the metal music and...

33:29.108 --> 33:32.177
and Led Zeppelin and Black
Sabbath and all of that.

33:32.311 --> 33:34.346
And then,
out of that again,

33:34.480 --> 33:36.048
then, let's say,
then came Lars

33:36.215 --> 33:37.916
and all of that
and being...

33:38.083 --> 33:38.951
So I think that...

33:39.118 --> 33:40.552
that they have certainly, uh,

33:40.719 --> 33:42.221
a place in all of that, I think.

33:42.388 --> 33:45.224
Lars had a very good
vision, at the time,

33:45.391 --> 33:48.060
of where he saw

33:48.227 --> 33:50.462
that particular... you know,
the metal music going,

33:50.629 --> 33:51.764
because he could see

33:51.930 --> 33:54.199
with European
ears and eyes, maybe.

33:54.333 --> 33:57.970
Yes, actually. Don't you
feel that it's great for you

33:58.137 --> 34:01.907
to have your father's
perspective <i>on...</i>

34:02.074 --> 34:03.776
on who you are and
what you're doing?

34:03.942 --> 34:05.577
I think that's
incredible, and it's...

34:05.744 --> 34:07.646
you know, talk about
the lineage...

34:07.813 --> 34:08.981
which we did.

34:09.148 --> 34:10.149
We talked a little bit
about your grandfather...

34:10.315 --> 34:11.483
I mean, it's very
difficult to admit it,

34:11.650 --> 34:12.885
especially with him
standing next to me.

34:13.018 --> 34:15.087
I... it's easier
to talk about

34:15.254 --> 34:17.255
when he's not
in my presence.

34:17.422 --> 34:18.556
But, urn...

34:18.690 --> 34:21.060
of course it is.

34:21.193 --> 34:22.494
Yeah.
What would you...

34:22.661 --> 34:24.163
what would you
say in private?

34:24.329 --> 34:25.164
To who?

34:25.330 --> 34:26.598
To anybody,
without him here.

34:26.764 --> 34:27.733
Say it.

34:27.866 --> 34:28.900
You know, what...
what would it be?

34:29.034 --> 34:30.235
Well, I mean,
I've already said it

34:30.369 --> 34:31.235
to you countless times.

34:31.370 --> 34:33.338
Well, have you
said it to him?

34:35.040 --> 34:37.109
(laughs)
Urn...

34:37.275 --> 34:38.110
TOWLE:
What is it that you...

34:38.277 --> 34:39.110
you-you brought it up.

34:39.277 --> 34:40.279
I didn't bring it up.

34:40.446 --> 34:42.114
What is it you feel you've said

34:42.281 --> 34:43.649
that you're not saying now?

34:43.815 --> 34:44.783

34:44.949 --> 34:45.851

34:46.018 --> 34:47.085
TOWLE:
To me, that's...

34:47.219 --> 34:49.321
A fear of status quo

34:49.487 --> 34:51.489
comes a little bit from
this direction over here.

34:51.657 --> 34:53.692
I think that, um...

34:53.859 --> 34:55.661
I mean there's
nothing worse

34:55.828 --> 34:57.763
than when I have to go to him
and play the new record

34:57.896 --> 35:00.432
and know there's something
on there that sucks.

35:00.566 --> 35:01.867
And he can see
right through that

35:02.034 --> 35:03.635
in two and a half
seconds flat.

36:07.699 --> 36:09.101
I mean, it's interesting,
you know, now... Yeah.

36:09.268 --> 36:11.203
I mean, other than the people
involved here... Yeah...

36:11.370 --> 36:12.437
...the only other people
who've heard

36:12.604 --> 36:14.039
any of this music
is Cliff Burnstein.

36:14.206 --> 36:15.174
Yeah.

36:15.307 --> 36:16.375
When Cliff Burnstein heard that,

36:16.542 --> 36:18.177
he thought that should
open the record.

36:18.310 --> 36:19.178
Yeah?
(laughs)

36:19.311 --> 36:21.013
I mean, that
could well be.

36:21.146 --> 36:22.381
But I...

36:22.548 --> 36:24.883
I'm pretty sure that...

You know?

36:30.889 --> 36:32.191
(both laughing)

36:32.324 --> 36:33.292
I really
don't think so.

36:34.726 --> 36:35.561
Right.

36:35.727 --> 36:36.762
TORBEN:
For me, that...

36:36.929 --> 36:38.764
that doesn't sound
right or something.

36:38.931 --> 36:40.299
You know.

36:40.465 --> 36:42.568
Unless I'm... a guy

36:42.734 --> 36:43.702
that's kind of, uh,

36:43.835 --> 36:45.103

<i>II'</i>

37:05.290 --> 37:07.726
(indistinct talking)

37:17.336 --> 37:19.638
TOWLE: So I think one of
our responsibilities here

37:19.805 --> 37:21.640
is to act like a band

37:21.807 --> 37:23.609
<i>that's still continuing.
We're going on.</i>

37:23.775 --> 37:24.943
<i>We're doing our exploring.</i>

37:25.110 --> 37:26.445
<i>We're exploring ourselves
individually,</i>

37:26.612 --> 37:28.447
we're exploring
our relationships.

37:28.614 --> 37:29.681
And, uh, we
really need to...

37:29.848 --> 37:32.784
get together,
talk about this,

37:32.951 --> 37:34.786
act like the band exists...

37:34.953 --> 37:36.188
because it does exist.

37:36.355 --> 37:38.523
And if we don't do that,

37:38.690 --> 37:41.026
then we are

37:41.193 --> 37:43.795
the co-producers
of the process

37:43.962 --> 37:45.530
slipping off the planet.

37:46.965 --> 37:49.334
It is a bit of
a shit sandwich, though.

37:49.501 --> 37:51.603
What is it...

37:51.737 --> 37:52.971
the unraveling of a band?

37:53.138 --> 37:54.139
(laughs)

37:54.306 --> 37:55.641
And then there were two?

37:55.807 --> 37:57.476
HAMMET: Yeah. You know...
ROCK: So...

37:57.643 --> 38:00.012
Uh... a good friend of mine

38:00.178 --> 38:01.280
phoned me.

38:01.413 --> 38:02.781
And he knew where James was.

38:02.914 --> 38:03.815
ULRICH:
Really?

38:03.982 --> 38:05.517
Yeah. He couldn't
even imagine

38:05.684 --> 38:09.454
James doing anything
for six months.

38:12.524 --> 38:14.960
I'm prepared for the worst.

38:15.093 --> 38:17.529
I'm pretty confident that,
you know,

38:17.696 --> 38:20.499
we will come together
when the time is right.

38:20.666 --> 38:22.134
But...

38:22.267 --> 38:25.671
knowing when that time
will come...

38:25.837 --> 38:28.006
or not knowing
when that time will come

38:28.173 --> 38:30.575
is very, very uncomfortable.

38:30.742 --> 38:35.047
ULRICH: I hope that,
at some point, he will

38:35.213 --> 38:38.050
come back and try and finish

38:38.216 --> 38:40.185
the making of this record.

38:41.386 --> 38:42.854
If...

38:51.263 --> 38:52.698
If he walked away
from Metallica,

40:03.869 --> 40:05.570
<i>depressive things that show up</i>

40:05.704 --> 40:07.906
<i>as a result of the alcohol

40:08.039 --> 40:09.608
<i>It was just very difficult</i>

<i>You want some or not'? Not hide behind
a lot of these different fronts.</i>

40:15.714 --> 40:17.949
<i>Whether it's alcohol,

40:26.124 --> 40:28.427

41:38.029 --> 41:39.931
And, you know,

41:40.098 --> 41:43.235
whenever you
check yourself into rehab,

41:43.401 --> 41:44.836
they don't...

41:44.970 --> 41:46.271
they don't focus on,
you know,

41:46.438 --> 41:47.839
the fact that
you're an alcoholic.

41:47.973 --> 41:49.274
They go much deeper, you know?

41:49.441 --> 41:50.942
I mean, they go way deep.

41:51.109 --> 41:52.878
They crack you open
and then spill you out

41:53.044 --> 41:56.915
and-and examine all the things
that are on the table.

41:57.082 --> 41:59.885
<i>L-I've spoken to him
a few times,</i>

42:00.051 --> 42:04.122
<i>and, you know, I know he's
having a-a rough trip.</i>

42:06.391 --> 42:09.094
<i>HAMMETT:
No matter how bad it gets...</i>

42:09.261 --> 42:10.962
eventually, things seem to

42:11.129 --> 42:12.430
sort themselves out,

42:12.597 --> 42:14.132
sooner or later.

42:15.901 --> 42:17.035
Whether it's good or bad,

42:17.168 --> 42:18.703
they sort themselves out.

42:21.940 --> 42:24.109
MUSTAINE: <i>I watched people
around the world say,</i>

42:24.276 --> 42:26.378
<i>"What a great guitar player
Kirk is."</i>

42:26.511 --> 42:28.647
And what a piece of shit I am

42:28.813 --> 42:30.048
<i>and that I, uh...</i>

42:30.181 --> 42:32.083
<i>got kicked out of Metallica.</i>

42:32.250 --> 42:34.085
<i>And I wasn't
good enough for them</i>

42:34.252 --> 42:35.487
<i>and that I was a loser and...</i>

42:35.654 --> 42:36.821
(sighs)
...and I've had to

42:36.988 --> 42:38.089
deal with that for...

42:38.256 --> 42:40.926
almost 20 years.

42:42.327 --> 42:43.094
<i>And it's-it's</i>

42:43.261 --> 42:44.596
<i>a dreadful experience.</i>

42:46.431 --> 42:48.266
<i>It's been hard, Lars.</i>

42:48.433 --> 42:49.968
It's been hard to watch

42:50.135 --> 42:51.603
everything that you guys do,

42:51.770 --> 42:53.171
and you touch, turn to gold

42:53.338 --> 42:54.139
and everything that I do,

42:54.306 --> 42:55.974
fucking backfire.

42:56.141 --> 42:57.309
And I'm sure there's

42:57.475 --> 42:59.644
a lot of people that...

42:59.811 --> 43:00.946
they would consider my backfire

43:01.112 --> 43:02.948
a complete success.

43:03.114 --> 43:05.483
You know, and, and
am I happy being number two?

43:05.650 --> 43:06.918
No!

43:08.620 --> 43:09.788
You know?

43:09.955 --> 43:11.189
You're just now
encountering something

43:11.356 --> 43:13.625
I've been going through
13, 14 years.

43:13.792 --> 43:15.527
I've never had a chance

43:15.694 --> 43:18.129
to be able to tell you
without...

43:18.296 --> 43:20.365
talking to Lars,
the guy in Metallica.

43:20.532 --> 43:23.034
I've never talked to my
little Danish friend again.

43:23.201 --> 43:24.703
You know?

43:24.869 --> 43:26.004
I remembered the day
you and I talked about

43:26.171 --> 43:28.306
digging a hole in fucking dirt
and smoking hash

43:28.473 --> 43:29.941
through the ground.

43:31.509 --> 43:32.877
That, to me, is the,

43:33.044 --> 43:35.013
the stuff that's, like...

43:35.180 --> 43:36.448
(chuckles)

43:36.581 --> 43:37.649
You know?

43:37.816 --> 43:38.683
And we've never had...

43:38.850 --> 43:41.052
very many moments like that.

43:42.520 --> 43:43.955
Do I feel some guilt?

43:44.089 --> 43:45.156
Uh, yes, I do.

43:45.323 --> 43:46.558
But at the same time,

43:46.725 --> 43:48.460
it's difficult for me
to comprehend...

43:48.593 --> 43:49.728
that...

43:49.894 --> 43:51.563
the only thing...

43:51.730 --> 43:53.665
that you feel
when you look back

43:53.832 --> 43:55.634
on the last 20 years...

43:56.835 --> 43:58.169
is rooted...

43:58.336 --> 44:00.372
in...
the Metallica thing.

44:02.707 --> 44:05.010
Okay.

44:05.176 --> 44:07.145
Have you ever thought what,

44:07.278 --> 44:08.847
what I've been through?

44:09.014 --> 44:10.148
I think I've had
an awareness

44:10.281 --> 44:13.018
of the pain I caused you, urn...

44:13.184 --> 44:14.919
That's not what I said.

44:15.086 --> 44:16.488
Okay... um...

44:16.621 --> 44:17.689
Do you have any idea...?

44:17.856 --> 44:18.890
Of what I've
put you through...?

44:19.057 --> 44:20.091
What...? No. No. No.

44:20.258 --> 44:21.926
What I went through?

44:22.093 --> 44:26.031
I mean, people hate me
because of you.

44:26.197 --> 44:28.066
You know,
I, I walk down the street

44:28.233 --> 44:30.568
and I hear some
piece of shit say,

44:30.735 --> 44:31.903
"Metallica...!" to me

44:32.070 --> 44:33.371
and they do that to taunt me.

44:33.538 --> 44:35.373
I mean, when I would hear

44:35.540 --> 44:36.508
Metallica on the radio...

44:36.641 --> 44:37.575
I would be like,

44:37.742 --> 44:39.077
"God, I have to turn this off,

44:39.244 --> 44:40.712
"because I just keep thinking,

44:40.879 --> 44:43.581
'I fucked up."'

44:43.748 --> 44:45.550
Right.

44:45.717 --> 44:47.419
I've been waiting

44:47.585 --> 44:50.188
for this day for a long time.

44:50.321 --> 44:51.056
You know?

44:51.222 --> 44:52.390
And by no means

44:52.557 --> 44:54.693
is it done, because...

44:54.826 --> 44:56.194
somebody else very important
is not here.

44:56.327 --> 44:57.362
Right.

45:00.498 --> 45:02.600
Do I wish it was
1982 all over again,

45:02.767 --> 45:03.802
and you guys
woke me up

45:03.968 --> 45:05.904
and say,
"Hey, Dave, you know what?

45:06.071 --> 45:07.072
You need to go to AA"?

45:07.238 --> 45:08.540
Yeah.

45:14.512 --> 45:16.648
I'd give anything
for that chance.

45:22.087 --> 45:23.555
<i>DAVIS:
ls there any last words</i>

45:23.688 --> 45:25.090
you want to say
to everybody out there?

45:25.256 --> 45:26.324
Metal up your ass!

45:26.491 --> 45:27.459
(laughter)

45:27.625 --> 45:28.393
Okay, thank you.

45:28.526 --> 45:29.394
This is Donna Davis

45:29.527 --> 45:30.929
and this is Metallica.

45:33.364 --> 45:35.333
<i>(indistinct conversation)</i>

45:38.036 --> 45:39.137

45:39.304 --> 45:40.772
a <i>pretty bitchin' club

45:40.939 --> 45:41.573
<i>a first fucking gig.</i>

45:41.706 --> 45:42.574
DON KIN:
Yeah.

45:42.707 --> 45:44.109
How're you guys feeling?

45:44.275 --> 45:46.277
(scoffs) Freaking out.
Totally stoked, man.

45:46.444 --> 45:47.612
SAGRAFENA: Freaking out...?
Yeah. Totally.

45:47.779 --> 45:49.114
(laughter)
Totally. Freaking out, man.

45:49.280 --> 45:51.282
It's unfuckin' unbelievable

45:51.449 --> 45:53.184
is really what it comes
down to-- can I say that?

45:53.351 --> 45:55.153
Yeah, you can say
whatever you want.

45:55.320 --> 45:56.788
Great. Great. Yeah, it's
fucking unbelievable.

45:59.457 --> 46:02.026
WOMAN:
Echobrain! Yeah!

46:02.193 --> 46:03.528
I don't know. I-l just...

46:03.695 --> 46:05.497
All of a sudden, this became,
like, such a big production.

46:05.663 --> 46:07.031
I don't understand.

46:07.198 --> 46:08.600
It's, like, all of a sudden,
like, you know,

46:08.733 --> 46:10.034
I get, like, one phone call.

46:10.201 --> 46:11.970
It's like everybody and their
fuckin' brother in town.

46:12.137 --> 46:16.508
I thought it'd be Jason, like,
playing with his new bands...

46:16.674 --> 46:18.977
band for, you know,
like, 20 drunks

46:19.144 --> 46:21.780
down at some bar or something,
and now,

46:21.913 --> 46:25.450
I guess, to my own ignorance
or something, I-l...

46:25.583 --> 46:28.153
That's what... I guess
that's what I wanted it to be.

46:28.319 --> 46:30.155
So, now I'm realizing that...

46:30.321 --> 46:35.026
supposedly, it's a little more
of a big deal than that.

Oh, thanks.

47:16.801 --> 47:18.002
Awesome.
Right on.

I'm Lars. Oh, really?
Nice to meet you.

47:19.704 --> 47:20.872
Great to meet you.
Uh, thanks.

47:21.039 --> 47:22.340
Where's Jason?
Oh. Jase?

47:22.473 --> 47:24.509
I don't know. Uh, dude, I
think he went back to...

47:24.642 --> 47:25.777
I think... I think
he went to...

47:25.944 --> 47:27.045
I think he already
fucking bailed.

47:27.212 --> 47:28.713
Think he might have went back <i>to...
</i> Did? Really?

47:28.880 --> 47:30.215
Nice.
Wow...

47:30.381 --> 47:32.750
Go back to say "hey", and
he's, like, fucking gone.

47:32.917 --> 47:34.853
Elvis has left
the building.

47:34.986 --> 47:36.855
There's Zack.

47:36.988 --> 47:38.423
Hey, Zack!

47:38.590 --> 47:39.791
You need help, or
are you all right?

47:39.958 --> 47:41.226
See, he's even
blowing me off.

47:41.392 --> 47:43.194
(laughter)
I know.

47:43.328 --> 47:45.463
Jason blows me off,
Zack blows me off.

47:45.630 --> 47:47.599
How quick we become
yesterday's news.

47:47.765 --> 47:49.567
(laughing):
Yeah. No-no kidding.

47:49.734 --> 47:52.237
See, there's a guy
in an Echobrain T-shirt.

47:52.403 --> 47:53.438
Yeah, that's
Steve over there.

47:53.605 --> 47:54.906
He works at the
studio with us.

47:55.073 --> 47:56.207
(laughing)

47:56.341 --> 47:58.409
Well, he is.
Really?

47:58.576 --> 47:59.777
Yeah.

47:59.944 --> 48:00.945
I remember that guy.
Huh?

48:01.112 --> 48:02.146
I remember that guy.

48:02.313 --> 48:03.581
He worked at the studio.
Which guy?

48:03.748 --> 48:05.817
Over there.
The guy in the red shorts?

48:05.984 --> 48:07.785
No. No, the guy in the black
that's walking across right now.

48:07.952 --> 48:09.587
Really?
Kessel.

48:09.754 --> 48:13.291
Todd? He works
at the studio, too, doesn't he?

48:13.458 --> 48:15.226
Who?
Todd over there.

48:15.360 --> 48:17.729
I'm sure
they're all here, Bob.

48:17.862 --> 48:19.731
I mean, the only two people
in the Bay Area

48:19.864 --> 48:22.166
not working for him
is me and you.

48:22.333 --> 48:24.168
Yeah.
Hetfield's gonna freak.

48:24.335 --> 48:26.437
I'm in fucking

48:26.604 --> 48:27.839
hell.

48:28.006 --> 48:30.108
This whole gig has brought
all of this on, hasn't it?

48:30.275 --> 48:31.609
Yes, it has.
You really want to come clean.

48:31.776 --> 48:32.777
It's made me feel like...

48:32.944 --> 48:36.347
It's made me feel
like such a loser.

48:36.514 --> 48:38.683
I mean, I can't hold my band
together.

48:38.850 --> 48:40.618
You know?

48:40.785 --> 48:43.187
I start records,
I don't finish them.

48:43.354 --> 48:45.189
I fucking... I...

48:45.356 --> 48:47.959
Oh!

48:48.126 --> 48:50.094
(sighs heavily)

48:51.996 --> 48:54.966
Jason is the future,
Metallica's the past.

48:56.467 --> 48:58.369
<i>ROCK". I've never had
a break like this.</i>

48:58.536 --> 48:59.704
In 20 years.

48:59.871 --> 49:01.139
Do you know what I mean?

49:01.306 --> 49:03.841
And just what's been
kind of getting me is...

49:04.008 --> 49:05.176
is just not knowing.

49:05.343 --> 49:06.644
<i>Do-do you know what I mean?</i>

49:06.811 --> 49:09.147
<i>Not knowing, and not hearing--
that's just like...</i>

49:09.314 --> 49:10.882
<i>It just eats away at you.</i>

49:11.049 --> 49:13.217
Kirk talked to him. HAMMETT:
I talked to James today.

49:13.384 --> 49:14.652
Just me and you.
ROCK: Oh, cool.

49:14.819 --> 49:16.955
Yeah.
TOWLE: What did he say?

49:17.088 --> 49:19.958
He basically said that...

49:20.925 --> 49:22.060
you know, he just...

49:22.226 --> 49:23.528
His family's
the priority right now,

49:23.695 --> 49:27.665
and he needs time
to work on his family

49:27.832 --> 49:31.803
before he can reach out
to his other family, being us.

49:31.936 --> 49:34.038
And that he loves us, and...

49:34.205 --> 49:36.307
he just needs for us to...

49:36.441 --> 49:39.143
to understand
that he needs time.

49:39.277 --> 49:41.579
And he also went on about...

49:41.746 --> 49:45.183
how difficult it was
talking to-to you about it,

49:45.350 --> 49:47.352
because he felt pressured.

49:47.518 --> 49:49.354
And you know,
he-he spoke about

49:49.520 --> 49:52.857
how you always need to be in
control of the situation,

49:53.024 --> 49:55.026
or in control of the
schedule, or whatever.

49:55.193 --> 49:57.328
And he said that
this is a time,

49:57.462 --> 50:00.665
he needs complete
control of the situation.

50:00.798 --> 50:02.900
And he said, you know,

50:03.067 --> 50:05.370
all the Marc Reiters, and
the Bob Rocks, all that...

50:05.536 --> 50:07.338
all that stuff,
you know, just has...

50:07.472 --> 50:09.374
I-I can't think
of that right now.

50:09.540 --> 50:11.175
So, you know,
I got the feeling

50:11.309 --> 50:13.378
that he kind of lumps
in your relationship

50:13.544 --> 50:15.213
with the business
side of things,

50:15.380 --> 50:18.583
which was actually
really surprising to me.

50:21.219 --> 50:22.920
But I think that's...

50:23.087 --> 50:25.023
You know, that explains a...

50:25.156 --> 50:29.193
I think that explains a lot,
on why he hasn't spoken to you.

50:32.563 --> 50:34.399
ULRICH:
We're just in limbo, and

50:34.565 --> 50:38.069
the longer James chooses

50:38.236 --> 50:40.738
to stay away
from dealing with us,

50:40.905 --> 50:43.908
the further we drift apart,
and I just

50:44.075 --> 50:47.445
feel... so...

50:47.612 --> 50:50.081
disrespected.

50:50.248 --> 50:52.550
That-That's the key...
the key thing.

50:55.853 --> 50:57.722
<i>MAN".
Was the future of the group</i>

50:57.855 --> 51:00.158
ever in doubt, even when James
went into rehab, do you think?

51:00.324 --> 51:04.395
Lars and I--
uh, we-we were wondering

51:04.529 --> 51:06.931
when James was going

51:07.098 --> 51:08.966
to finally feel

51:09.133 --> 51:12.470
like he was in a situation where
he can come back to the band.

51:12.637 --> 51:15.339
And after a certain amount
of months,

51:15.506 --> 51:17.608
you know,
Lars and I started to think.

51:17.775 --> 51:20.111
Well, is he ever gonna come back
to the band?

51:20.278 --> 51:22.680
And that was a really
big question on our plates.

51:22.847 --> 51:25.783
Whether or not, you know,
he wanted to come back.

51:25.950 --> 51:27.919
<i>II'</i>

51:33.491 --> 51:35.126
<i>ULRICH:
James wrote something</i>

51:35.293 --> 51:37.662
<i>in the new issue
of our magazine, So</i> What.

51:37.829 --> 51:41.499
<i>He wrote a kind of
a little handwritten note.</i>

51:41.666 --> 51:44.836
<i>That note was probably
the most heartfelt thing</i>

51:45.002 --> 51:48.773
<i>I'd ever seen come
from his mind.</i>

51:51.209 --> 51:54.212
Tomorrow is... shaping up,

51:54.378 --> 51:56.380
or is gearing itself up to be,

51:56.547 --> 51:58.516
yes, the first to sit down

51:58.683 --> 52:03.654
with one James Hetfield
post... uh, rehab.

52:14.332 --> 52:15.867
Yeah.

52:16.033 --> 52:17.168
Yeah. Is that...?

52:17.335 --> 52:18.736
Why are we filming this?

52:20.605 --> 52:22.406
I don't know.

52:34.585 --> 52:36.220
We're in very different places.

52:36.387 --> 52:38.556
Or, at least,
I am in a very different place

52:38.723 --> 52:40.158
than I was from the Presidio.

52:40.291 --> 52:41.492
(laughs)

52:43.227 --> 52:45.196
<i>That's a huge understatement.</i>

52:46.697 --> 52:48.933
So...

52:49.100 --> 52:50.668
we just have to find that if,

52:50.801 --> 52:53.871
you know,
if the movie will be as

52:54.038 --> 52:55.406
intense, you know.

52:55.573 --> 52:57.241
To-to me,

52:57.408 --> 52:59.410
there was a lot of intrusion,

52:59.577 --> 53:02.613
and I kind of went with it,
and felt...

53:02.780 --> 53:04.849
I felt uncomfortable.

53:04.982 --> 53:07.018
I felt uncomfortable with it.

53:07.151 --> 53:09.053
You know,
a boom following me around.

53:09.220 --> 53:10.521
And it just felt like

53:10.655 --> 53:12.790
I was in the spotlight
all the time, and I didn't...

53:12.957 --> 53:14.458
I-I guess I don't really
like that feeling.

53:14.625 --> 53:17.061
When we were in the Presidio
filming you guys playing...

53:17.228 --> 53:18.462
Mm-hmm.

53:18.629 --> 53:19.931
Did you feel it then, too?

53:20.097 --> 53:21.232
Yeah. It was...

53:21.399 --> 53:22.533
it was pretty much
all the time.

53:22.667 --> 53:23.734
SINOFSKY:
I mean, do you think

53:23.901 --> 53:24.902
you're in a
better place now?

53:25.069 --> 53:26.070
I mean, we got
to find some...

53:26.237 --> 53:27.305
I'm definitely
in a better place.

53:27.471 --> 53:28.906
Having some place
that makes you feel comfortable.

53:29.073 --> 53:31.042
And the last thing we want
to do is have it impede

53:31.175 --> 53:32.243
on your music,
because that's

53:32.410 --> 53:33.778
more important than anything.
BERLINGER: Right.

53:33.945 --> 53:35.947
You know, one-one answer
may be there...

53:36.113 --> 53:37.748
Maybe there shouldn't
be a film.

53:37.915 --> 53:40.117
I mean, that-that's
the range of possibilities

53:40.284 --> 53:42.486
that we should really
think about, because...

53:42.653 --> 53:44.822
I mean, why do you
guys want to film?

53:44.989 --> 53:46.891
Even you said that you hope
that the film is made.

53:47.024 --> 53:48.960
I mean...
That's a big question,

53:49.126 --> 53:50.428
'cause for me,
it was really just...

53:50.595 --> 53:51.762
it came along with
being in Metallica.

53:51.929 --> 53:53.497
"Hey, we're gonna do this."

53:53.664 --> 53:55.399
"on, okay."

53:55.533 --> 53:58.436
That's part of this,
all of this...

53:58.603 --> 53:59.770
(laughs)

53:59.937 --> 54:03.107
...the bigness of Metallica,
and I'm kind of tired of it.

54:03.274 --> 54:06.110
You might look at it
as a friend; to me, it's...

54:06.277 --> 54:07.945
it's been a beast.

54:08.112 --> 54:10.648
And it's sucked
a lot of me into it.

54:10.815 --> 54:12.283
(Towle clears throat)

54:12.450 --> 54:14.619
You were maybe the keeper
of the beast at one point.

54:14.785 --> 54:16.320
You know, because
you were the champion

54:16.487 --> 54:18.356
of-of that fifth...
that entity.

54:18.522 --> 54:19.790
ULRICH:
And, of course,

54:19.957 --> 54:21.759
you got to just find
the right balance

54:21.892 --> 54:23.661
between what everybody's
personal needs are,

54:23.828 --> 54:28.199
but if Metallica collectively
decides to do this,

54:28.366 --> 54:30.968
then I think
Metallica can make it happen.

54:31.135 --> 54:33.037
I don't know.
That scares me again.

54:33.204 --> 54:36.140
Metallica is...
three individuals.

54:36.307 --> 54:39.143
And three individuals have
to decide if it's good to do.

54:39.310 --> 54:40.645
ULRICH:
But...

54:40.811 --> 54:45.683
I still think that
the priority is the collective

54:45.850 --> 54:49.654
until all the people involved
in the collective say

54:49.820 --> 54:52.823
that the priority
is the individual.

54:52.990 --> 54:54.525
And so far,
you're the only one

54:54.692 --> 54:56.327
that said the priority
is the individual.

54:56.494 --> 54:59.363
I haven't said that,
and he hasn't said that.

54:59.530 --> 55:00.831
I haven't
heard him say that.

55:00.998 --> 55:02.833
So, I feel that,

55:03.000 --> 55:04.201
it's still...

55:04.368 --> 55:06.203
there's still
an unbalance there.

01:01:15.572 --> 01:01:17.207
I'll go and listen to it.

01:01:17.374 --> 01:01:19.376
But we should at least listen to it...
So we should stop earlier.

01:01:19.543 --> 01:01:21.578
But I know you'll sit there
and start talking with Bob.

01:01:21.745 --> 01:01:23.280
Maybe Bob doesn't want
to sit in there and...

01:01:23.447 --> 01:01:25.282
When I'm gone,
things get talked about

01:01:25.449 --> 01:01:28.085
and then decisions are made and
I feel I walk into something

01:01:28.252 --> 01:01:29.720
that's already
kind of decided.

01:01:29.887 --> 01:01:32.289
And it's a total uphill battle
for me a lot of times.

01:01:32.456 --> 01:01:33.757
I don't like
that feeling.

01:01:33.924 --> 01:01:36.393
Well, that's like...
just like the last 15 years.

01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:37.895
- Yeah. -For me.
- Well, let's talk...

01:01:38.062 --> 01:01:39.897
let's-let's talk about this
tomorrow then.

01:01:40.064 --> 01:01:41.465
Or do you want
to take the time out?

01:01:41.632 --> 01:01:43.367
No, I don't have time right now.
Okay.

01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:44.568
It's past 4:00.
Okay.

01:01:44.735 --> 01:01:48.906
It's hard to introduce structure
into this.

01:01:49.073 --> 01:01:51.108
TOWLE: Uh-huh. And I'm trying.

01:01:51.275 --> 01:01:52.710
TOWLE:
So what do you think, Lars?

01:01:52.843 --> 01:01:55.379
Can we hear the song
from yesterday?

01:01:55.512 --> 01:01:57.581
That we all
heard together.

01:01:57.748 --> 01:01:59.917

How is that different?

01:02:00.084 --> 01:02:02.486
Because we all heard
it together already.

01:02:02.653 --> 01:02:05.055
TOWLE: Well, what he wants, to be a
part of everything. Was I in there?

01:02:05.189 --> 01:02:07.157
He wants to be a part of everything.
Yes, you were.

01:02:07.324 --> 01:02:10.094
We all heard it together.
ROCK You came in.

01:02:10.260 --> 01:02:12.596
HETFIELD: All right, as long
as you don't talk about it.

01:02:12.763 --> 01:02:14.598
You know what I mean. TOWLE: Is that
a way around it or is that just

01:02:14.765 --> 01:02:15.933
That is definitely a way around it.
ULRICH: No, it's...

01:02:16.100 --> 01:02:17.601
it's interesting to hear
TOWLE: How about if we just

01:02:17.768 --> 01:02:20.571
what we're doing. How about if
we just save up the tension.

01:02:20.704 --> 01:02:22.139
Seriously. I mean,
it's okay 'cause it's gonna...

01:02:22.306 --> 01:02:25.976

fucking self-absorbed.

that you always talk about...

you always
talk about me.

01:06:19.910 --> 01:06:22.646

and "manipulation" a lot.

on purpose,

01:06:26.116 --> 01:06:27.884

control inadvertently.

01:06:28.051 --> 01:06:30.988
I think you control by

you always judge people.

01:16:06.462 --> 01:16:09.666
the idea of the guitar solo
as we have known it

01:16:09.832 --> 01:16:12.902
maybe being something
that was a little...

01:16:13.036 --> 01:16:14.904
outdated, and maybe

01:16:15.038 --> 01:16:18.441
reintroducing some
riff-a-rama things.

01:16:18.608 --> 01:16:20.944

the whole thing--

01:16:24.814 --> 01:16:26.182
that's so bullshit, you know?

01:16:26.349 --> 01:16:29.118
If you put a guitar <i>s...</i> Or if
you don't play a guitar solo

01:16:29.285 --> 01:16:31.788
in one of these songs,
that dates it to this period.

01:16:31.955 --> 01:16:33.923
And that-that's
cemented to a trend

01:16:34.057 --> 01:16:36.092
that's happening
in music right now.

01:16:36.225 --> 01:16:37.527
I think that's stupid
and I think it's

01:16:37.694 --> 01:16:39.195
totally trendy. I know
that's not what I said.

01:16:39.362 --> 01:16:41.798
ULRICH: It's always been about,
like, where could it go

01:16:41.965 --> 01:16:44.434

and interesting

01:16:44.567 --> 01:16:46.636

something from the past?

01:16:46.803 --> 01:16:49.472
HAMMETT: I'm not interested
in playing traditional

01:16:49.639 --> 01:16:51.708
guitar solos anymore.
You know, that's just...

01:16:51.874 --> 01:16:54.444
For me it's... it's just boring, you know.
And you told me that.

01:16:54.577 --> 01:16:56.846
ROCK
To me, if you can add

01:16:57.013 --> 01:16:59.549
a color to the song
that-that satisfies you

01:16:59.716 --> 01:17:01.284
and works for the song,
then that's

01:17:01.417 --> 01:17:02.485
what we should
do with it.

01:17:02.652 --> 01:17:04.220
But I don't want to
get in the position

01:17:04.387 --> 01:17:06.623
where it's like, we put
something down on the tape

01:17:06.756 --> 01:17:09.192
to satisfy your ego, my ego,

01:17:09.359 --> 01:17:10.727
Lars's ego or James's ego.

01:17:10.893 --> 01:17:13.129
I think it should serve
what's going down.

01:17:13.262 --> 01:17:15.031
Like, in other words,
there shouldn't be,

01:17:15.198 --> 01:17:17.066
like, a rule
of no solos.

01:17:17.233 --> 01:17:19.302
There shouldn't be
a rule of solos.

01:17:19.435 --> 01:17:20.903
It should be...
And I agree.

01:17:21.070 --> 01:17:22.872
I mean, it really is,
to me, all about

01:17:23.039 --> 01:17:24.841
serving the song,
and, you know,

01:17:25.008 --> 01:17:27.343
I feel much better about that,

01:17:27.510 --> 01:17:29.512
because, you know, I-l...

01:17:29.679 --> 01:17:32.081
I just don't want to follow
certain trends that I see

01:17:32.248 --> 01:17:34.050
other bands following.
We don't

01:17:34.217 --> 01:17:36.352
necessarily have to stick
to our traditional way,

01:17:36.519 --> 01:17:38.588

have to follow that trend.

"Fuck you, you never
do anything for us.

01:20:40.469 --> 01:20:42.872
We're gonna fuck you
on the next record."

01:20:43.039 --> 01:20:45.041
People would do that?

01:20:45.208 --> 01:20:48.611
Because you didn't give us
something, we're gonna fuck you?

01:20:48.778 --> 01:20:50.713
Yes, James. (laughs)

01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:52.215
They would.

01:29:29.598 --> 01:29:31.734
Me and my buddy like James
Hetfield here have shed

01:29:31.900 --> 01:29:34.570
blood, sweat, and motherfucking
beer to get where we are today.

01:29:34.737 --> 01:29:36.572
Beer! Good!

01:29:36.739 --> 01:29:37.973
Who do you
think you are?

01:29:38.140 --> 01:29:39.575
I mean, just you know,
because you, like, made us rich,

01:29:39.742 --> 01:29:41.577
you think you can
get free stuff?

01:29:41.744 --> 01:29:43.312
Songs that we spent
upwards of, you know,

01:29:43.479 --> 01:29:46.148
like 24 to 48 hours
writing and recording.

01:29:46.315 --> 01:29:47.816
Our team of lawyers
and researchers have

01:29:47.983 --> 01:29:49.151
your names, and
you Napster users,

01:29:49.318 --> 01:29:52.721
we'll see you in jail
getting gang raped.

and stay to my convictions, but
it was eating away at me inside.

it could go lyrically to, urn,

Lars, what I want to know is...

01:32:14.796 --> 01:32:16.365
What?
Do the four of you

01:32:16.498 --> 01:32:18.066
just go in there and just jam?

01:32:18.233 --> 01:32:19.434
You're hearing

01:32:19.601 --> 01:32:22.738
excerpts of three-hour jams.

01:32:22.905 --> 01:32:24.473
You're hearing... It...

01:32:24.640 --> 01:32:26.074
Look at it as a funnel.

01:32:26.241 --> 01:32:29.411
You're hearing the very part
at the bottom of the funnel.

01:32:29.578 --> 01:32:30.746
Right.

01:32:30.913 --> 01:32:32.314
You can almost equate what
we're doing now to arranging.

01:32:32.481 --> 01:32:33.715
Right.
ULRICH: Yeah.

01:32:33.849 --> 01:32:35.384

Pollack, the painter.

01:32:35.517 --> 01:32:39.922

the, uh, funnel arranger guy.

01:32:40.088 --> 01:32:41.623

sound fucking amazing

01:32:41.790 --> 01:32:43.425

100,000 people,

01:32:43.592 --> 01:32:45.460

"Metallica, baby."

Oh.
ROCK: Oh, my God.

01:32:50.832 --> 01:32:52.601
Can we fast forward
to that right now?

<i>I'd like to talk about this
touring thing that has come up.</i>

01:33:19.461 --> 01:33:21.496
We're very cognizant of the fact

01:33:21.663 --> 01:33:24.366
that, you know, things have
changed for you guys.

01:33:24.533 --> 01:33:25.867
And they've changed

01:33:26.034 --> 01:33:27.636
for many, many reasons.

01:33:27.803 --> 01:33:29.004
Why can't we figure out

01:33:29.171 --> 01:33:32.708
what works best for everybody
in their personal lives,

01:33:32.874 --> 01:33:37.212
plus, what works best
as a business?

01:33:37.379 --> 01:33:40.349
What if you just do
a stadium tour

01:33:40.515 --> 01:33:42.951
where you play Friday,
Saturday and Sunday,

01:33:43.085 --> 01:33:44.987
and then, you go home
the rest of the week?

01:33:48.557 --> 01:33:51.126
I just want to put
out that, you know,

01:33:51.259 --> 01:33:54.329
it might be a kind of
an uncomfortable vibe here,

01:33:54.496 --> 01:33:56.498
'cause people might not know

01:33:56.665 --> 01:33:58.533
how I'm feeling
about touring,

01:33:58.700 --> 01:34:00.335
and I don't really
know, either...

01:34:00.502 --> 01:34:02.237
(laughter) you know,
until I get there.

01:34:02.404 --> 01:34:03.639
Yeah.
And...

01:34:03.772 --> 01:34:05.674
you know, I
I want to tour.

01:34:05.841 --> 01:34:08.076
I don't want to fall
off the wagon, you know.

01:34:08.243 --> 01:34:09.811
I don't want to
go out there.

01:34:09.945 --> 01:34:11.179
I don't know
what it's like.

01:34:11.346 --> 01:34:12.848
Doing things for the
first time again--

01:34:13.015 --> 01:34:15.884
as I think I've said
before-- it's a little scary.

01:34:16.051 --> 01:34:18.220
(applause, cheering
and whistling)

01:34:18.387 --> 01:34:21.023
I don't know
about you, uh, but, uh,

01:34:21.189 --> 01:34:22.524
it's, like, summertime
and to me,

01:34:22.691 --> 01:34:25.360
it's, uh, fuckin'
beer-drinkin' weather, yeah?

01:34:26.261 --> 01:34:27.896
Yeah.

01:34:28.063 --> 01:34:29.431
Well, I'm gonna
take time right now

01:34:29.598 --> 01:34:32.501
and fuckin' have myself one,
and, uh, just want to say cheers

01:34:32.634 --> 01:34:34.436

But if you've got it going,

01:37:43.792 --> 01:37:46.061
you want it
to hammer all the way through.

01:37:46.228 --> 01:37:47.429

01:37:47.596 --> 01:37:50.432

watering it down in some way.

01:38:09.818 --> 01:38:11.953
That's all.
(chuckles)

01:38:12.120 --> 01:38:14.823
It's your call. HETFIELD: Yeah.

01:38:20.595 --> 01:38:23.265
HETFIELD: "Temptation," I
remember writing that thing.

01:38:23.431 --> 01:38:27.068
It came out...
it flowed totally instantly.

01:38:27.202 --> 01:38:30.105
"Temptation"
kind of sums up

01:38:30.272 --> 01:38:33.275
all the lyrics that are
in this new...

01:38:33.441 --> 01:38:34.943
kind of...

01:38:35.110 --> 01:38:37.279
project... so...

01:38:37.445 --> 01:38:39.447
And that... And it's cool,
because that was done

01:38:39.614 --> 01:38:42.317
long before "Recovery"
and all that,

01:38:42.484 --> 01:38:45.287
<i>so...</i> HAMMETT: I mean, I can
tell that you're singing

01:38:45.453 --> 01:38:47.289
your-your heart out. You're...

01:38:47.455 --> 01:38:50.792
definitely wearing your heart on
your sleeve <i>in...</i> on that song.

01:38:50.959 --> 01:38:53.128
ULRICH: To me,
it's more like a jam.

01:38:53.295 --> 01:38:55.964
Urn, is there a song
in there? Urn...

01:38:56.131 --> 01:38:57.966
potentially. Urn...

01:38:58.133 --> 01:39:02.304
You know, there's almost nothing
there that can't be turned into

01:39:02.470 --> 01:39:05.307
something better than it is
or something that could...

01:39:05.473 --> 01:39:07.542
probably get
pretty fuckin' close

01:39:07.709 --> 01:39:09.978
to being something
on a Metallica record.

01:39:10.145 --> 01:39:12.948
You know, but then
it just goes away

01:39:13.081 --> 01:39:14.115
from what the purpose--

01:39:14.249 --> 01:39:16.318
at least what I see the purpose
being today--

01:39:16.484 --> 01:39:17.886
which is show up
with what you...

01:39:18.053 --> 01:39:19.888
you know,
what are your A-pluses?

01:39:20.055 --> 01:39:21.656
You know?

01:39:21.823 --> 01:39:25.493
Well, when I hear Lars talk
about we can whip anything

01:39:25.660 --> 01:39:28.663
into decent shape, I agree.

01:39:28.830 --> 01:39:30.899
And we did that
on Load and Reload.

01:39:31.066 --> 01:39:33.501
HAMMETT: Yeah. And
this is us trying

01:39:33.668 --> 01:39:37.672
to choose before we take it to those
extremes, you know? ROCK: Exactly.

01:39:37.839 --> 01:39:39.341
That makes sense. Yeah.

01:39:39.507 --> 01:39:40.675
<i>HETFIELD:
That was</i> a <i>pretty major thing</i>

01:39:40.842 --> 01:39:43.078

on together,</i>

01:39:43.244 --> 01:39:45.547
<i>that, wow, I'd heard him
and he heard me.</i>

01:39:45.714 --> 01:39:47.182
<i>Huh.</i>

01:39:47.349 --> 01:39:51.219
It's like, "Oh, okay." It's like
it takes the cutting edge off

01:39:51.386 --> 01:39:55.590
of it, or the personal attack
off of it, you know?

01:39:55.757 --> 01:39:58.259
Things are a lot less dramatic
than they used to be

01:39:58.426 --> 01:40:02.263
within the chemistry
of the four of us.

01:40:02.430 --> 01:40:05.266

But... Can we just do one thing?

01:40:10.538 --> 01:40:13.708
For lack of a better word, when
it comes in with the drum...

01:40:13.875 --> 01:40:15.710
uh, drums, I just want you
to scream "fuck"

01:40:15.877 --> 01:40:18.246

Wow, I've never been this close
to it.

01:42:20.201 --> 01:42:21.503
<i>These are great paintings,</i>

<i>you get out of that moment
you have with that painting.</i>

01:42:32.213 --> 01:42:34.382

about dollars and cents.

01:42:34.549 --> 01:42:37.519

greater than that.

no matter
how you look at it--

01:45:18.012 --> 01:45:19.681
I've been making records
a very long time--

01:45:19.847 --> 01:45:22.216

01:46:09.330 --> 01:46:12.700
a fabulous few weeks with a lot
of great productivity,

01:46:12.834 --> 01:46:14.736
a lot of really good stuff
going on.

01:46:14.902 --> 01:46:18.139
The more we feel good
about ourselves and each other

01:46:18.306 --> 01:46:21.409
and the higher we ascend, the
more challenging it will be...

01:46:21.576 --> 01:46:23.044
it will be to our psyches.

01:46:23.177 --> 01:46:26.047
You-you know, I understand it,
I embrace it and all that stuff,

01:46:26.180 --> 01:46:28.449
but someti-sometimes
it just bugs me.

01:46:28.616 --> 01:46:31.986
I think the, <i>uh...</i>
that thing was kind of

01:46:32.153 --> 01:46:34.322
buggin' me yesterday.
All of them around the studio,

01:46:34.489 --> 01:46:35.556
it was just kind of like...

01:46:35.690 --> 01:46:37.892
That way of thinking,
it just doesn't work

01:46:38.025 --> 01:46:39.293
for me all the time.

01:46:39.460 --> 01:46:41.763
And I was a little pissed off,
uh, at it because right now

01:46:41.929 --> 01:46:43.998
in my life
it's not really working for me.

01:46:44.165 --> 01:46:45.933
L-I'm glad to know that's what you think.
I agree with that.

01:46:46.100 --> 01:46:47.769
Wholeheartedly.

01:46:47.935 --> 01:46:50.004
And if you feel
that way and wish

01:46:50.171 --> 01:46:52.473
to share that more directly,
I'd appreciate that, too...

01:46:52.640 --> 01:46:55.276
ROCK: Rather than tearing
the signs down? Yeah.

01:46:55.443 --> 01:46:58.446
We pay him $40,000 a month
to be pretty much available

01:46:58.613 --> 01:47:00.648
at our beck and call.

01:47:00.815 --> 01:47:03.117
So when this record's done,

01:47:03.284 --> 01:47:05.453
do we want to
collectively

01:47:05.620 --> 01:47:09.023
end the $40,000 a month...

01:47:09.190 --> 01:47:12.794
full-on thing?

01:47:12.960 --> 01:47:14.462
I'm afraid he's under
the impression that he's, like,

01:47:14.629 --> 01:47:16.931
in the band, you know?
HAMMETT: Yeah.

01:47:17.064 --> 01:47:20.935
And I see him coming
on the road, maybe, for a week.

01:47:21.068 --> 01:47:22.603
But after that,
I don't...

01:47:22.737 --> 01:47:24.605
I don't see him...

01:47:24.739 --> 01:47:29.610
uh, holding our hand
any further than that.

01:47:31.813 --> 01:47:33.948
So is that something we want
to present to him then?

01:47:34.081 --> 01:47:35.650
HAMMETT: Yeah. I think, um...
Okay.

01:47:35.817 --> 01:47:39.053
I think it's something...
Yeah, I think it's something

01:47:39.220 --> 01:47:41.722
we need to do
for our own well-being.

01:47:41.889 --> 01:47:45.526
Yeah, 'cause
I'm-I'm feeling uncomfortable.

01:47:47.395 --> 01:47:49.363
(playing riff on guitar)

01:47:53.835 --> 01:47:54.702
ROCK
Are you there?

01:47:54.869 --> 01:47:57.638
Hello. Hello, hello.

01:47:57.772 --> 01:47:59.474
Are they on the phone?

01:47:59.607 --> 01:48:01.375
ROCK: Yeah, they're on the
phone and they need you now.

01:48:01.542 --> 01:48:02.510
Oh, okay.

01:48:02.677 --> 01:48:04.512
<i>ULRICH:
James Hetfield is</i>

01:48:04.679 --> 01:48:06.013
in the room.
Hey, there.

01:48:06.180 --> 01:48:07.014
CLIFF <i>BURNSTEIN:
Hey, James, how you doing?</i>

01:48:07.181 --> 01:48:08.149
<i>HETFIELD:
Pretty good.</i>

01:48:08.282 --> 01:48:09.517
<i>BURNSTEIN:
I'm gonna let Marc...</i>

01:48:09.684 --> 01:48:11.185
<i>do the talking here,
because Marc was the one</i>

01:48:11.352 --> 01:48:12.520
<i>who's been talking to MTV.</i>

01:48:12.687 --> 01:48:14.322
<i>REITER:
Okay, so, um,</i>

01:48:14.455 --> 01:48:17.925
this afternoon, the official
offer came in for Icon.

01:48:18.092 --> 01:48:20.027
Assuming you want to do it.

01:48:20.194 --> 01:48:21.562
ULRICH: Let's do it. Cool, man.

01:48:21.729 --> 01:48:23.698
Right.
Yeah, I'm jazzed about it.

01:48:23.865 --> 01:48:25.867
The only thing
that you guys are required to do

01:48:26.033 --> 01:48:29.036
is show up for rehearsal
and then show up for the show

01:48:29.203 --> 01:48:32.073
on the third, and at the end
of the show, you guys

01:48:32.240 --> 01:48:34.709
take the stage
and perform a little bit.

01:48:34.876 --> 01:48:37.378
So what's Jason's role in all this?
What? Who?

01:48:37.545 --> 01:48:39.013
BURNSTEIN: Okay. REITER: But if I...
I mean...

01:48:39.146 --> 01:48:40.715
I don't think
Jason has any role.

01:48:40.882 --> 01:48:43.217
BURNSTEIN: He lost his icon
status when he left Metallica.

01:48:43.384 --> 01:48:45.853
(laughter)

01:48:45.987 --> 01:48:48.422
REITER: Nice one, Cliff.
Thank you.

01:48:48.589 --> 01:48:52.426
I think MTV would like the fact
that this would most likely be

01:48:52.593 --> 01:48:54.762
the introductory performance
of Metallica

01:48:54.929 --> 01:48:57.231
with a new bass player, whether
it's the new member or whoever.

01:48:57.398 --> 01:48:59.734
When is it supposed to be?
May what?

01:48:59.901 --> 01:49:02.737
REITER:
May 3. Saturday, May 3.

01:49:02.904 --> 01:49:05.806
See, that means you'd have to hire
someone by the second. (laughing): Okay.

01:49:05.973 --> 01:49:07.708
I think it can happen.

01:49:07.842 --> 01:49:10.711
You'd be required to be in Los
Angeles for all of two days...

01:49:10.845 --> 01:49:12.613
Because we didn't get
a new bass player,

01:49:12.780 --> 01:49:14.615
I think a lot
of people thought maybe

01:49:14.782 --> 01:49:16.617
that we were having trouble
finding one.

01:49:16.784 --> 01:49:19.287
We never started looking
for a new bass player

01:49:19.453 --> 01:49:20.788
until two months ago.

01:49:20.955 --> 01:49:23.658
We worked on ourselves,
identified...

01:49:23.824 --> 01:49:25.993
what part can we work on,

01:49:26.160 --> 01:49:28.262
so when someone else steps in,

01:49:28.429 --> 01:49:29.997
it's clean.

01:49:30.164 --> 01:49:32.800
They're not stepping
in our shit, you know?

01:49:35.603 --> 01:49:37.572
<i>HETFIELD: All right, thinking
about bass players, finally.</i>

01:49:37.705 --> 01:49:38.773
<i>So...</i>

01:49:38.940 --> 01:49:40.942
we're gonna need
a fourth member.

01:49:41.108 --> 01:49:43.244
You know, we know
you're a great bass player.

01:49:43.377 --> 01:49:45.846
It's the vibe, you know.
We need to make sure...

01:49:46.013 --> 01:49:47.782
TOWLE: Jason kind of
triggered this whole thing

01:49:47.949 --> 01:49:50.484
a couple of years ago
and, urn... I can't believe

01:49:50.651 --> 01:49:52.019
it's been two years, you know?

01:49:52.186 --> 01:49:53.688
And then we've gone through
some...

01:49:53.854 --> 01:49:55.690
ULRICH: We realized that we kind
of wanted somebody who was,

01:49:55.856 --> 01:49:58.693
like, our age; somebody who had
been around the block

01:49:58.859 --> 01:50:00.628
a couple times.
Right, right.

01:50:00.795 --> 01:50:03.664
We've-we've grown a lot, man.
These three guys

01:50:03.831 --> 01:50:05.533
in this band. Urn...

01:50:05.700 --> 01:50:08.135
ULRICH: And last time,
when we did this 14,

01:50:08.302 --> 01:50:09.503
15 years ago...
Uh-huh.

01:50:09.670 --> 01:50:11.872
16 years ago, I guess it was,

01:50:12.039 --> 01:50:13.374
we literally
sat down and...

01:50:13.541 --> 01:50:14.809
started auditioning
bass players,

01:50:14.976 --> 01:50:17.111
you know, the day after
the funeral Mmm.

01:50:17.244 --> 01:50:22.450
For Cliff, so now it's 16 years
later, different circumstances.

01:50:22.583 --> 01:50:26.287
When Jason left,
he took his basses with him.

01:50:26.420 --> 01:50:28.956
You want four or five?

01:50:29.090 --> 01:50:30.157
Uh, whatever.

01:50:30.324 --> 01:50:32.793
What-what five-strings
do you have?

01:50:33.861 --> 01:50:35.963

01:51:15.870 --> 01:51:18.873
Which one of me
are you talking to?

01:51:19.040 --> 01:51:21.008
<i>ULRICH: I think
that we should just spend</i>

01:51:21.142 --> 01:51:23.911
<i>the next two-and-a-half hours
with this guy.</i>

01:51:24.078 --> 01:51:25.546
(snifﬂes)
Don't you?

01:51:25.713 --> 01:51:29.717
L-I had a vision of us jamming
with him the last hour.

01:51:29.884 --> 01:51:32.219
L-I guess I just feel
this is kind of, like,

01:51:32.386 --> 01:51:35.222
weird to keep, like,
just doing our own thing.

01:51:35.389 --> 01:51:38.359
It just feels not welcoming.
This morning, I heard him

01:51:38.492 --> 01:51:40.394
<i>say he was pretty comfortable.</i>

01:51:40.561 --> 01:51:41.962
(all talking at once)

01:51:42.129 --> 01:51:43.964
It's not about what he says.

01:51:44.131 --> 01:51:46.400
It's about what I feel.

01:51:46.567 --> 01:51:48.736
HETFIELD: All right. ULRICH:
Are we cool, James?

01:51:48.903 --> 01:51:52.740
Yeah. I-l guess the only
other thing I'd like to say is,

01:51:52.907 --> 01:51:56.243
you know, when we leave this up
to just how we're feeling,

01:51:56.410 --> 01:51:59.747
a lot of it depends
on how you're feeling.

01:51:59.914 --> 01:52:00.948
You know, when you say

01:52:01.115 --> 01:52:02.717
those things. ROCK Um, not

01:52:02.850 --> 01:52:04.385

you know?

01:52:06.921 --> 01:52:09.724

01:52:25.106 --> 01:52:26.607
Urn, I could, uh...

01:52:26.774 --> 01:52:28.275
I could try "Battery."

01:52:28.442 --> 01:52:29.577
"Battery"? Yeah.
HAMMETT: You can play

01:52:29.710 --> 01:52:31.245

pretty mighty bass sound
you got going there.

01:53:02.209 --> 01:53:05.279

you know, with some
of the other guys,

01:55:23.117 --> 01:55:25.786
it was sort of ten percent
over their capabilities

01:55:25.953 --> 01:55:27.755
Mm-hmm. Yeah. or something like that.
And you don't

01:55:27.888 --> 01:55:29.156
feel that
with this guy at all.

01:55:29.323 --> 01:55:30.824

three songs...

01:55:30.991 --> 01:55:32.927
Like, "Sanitarium,"
"Nothing Else Matters," and...

01:55:33.060 --> 01:55:34.595
What was... There was some, uh...
HAMMETT: Uh...

01:55:34.728 --> 01:55:36.463
HETFIELD: "Sad But True."
"Sad But True." I mean,

01:55:36.630 --> 01:55:38.165
they were flawless.

01:55:38.332 --> 01:55:41.135
I looked over at him during
"Whiplash" and he was just

01:55:41.302 --> 01:55:43.504
right in the pocket
and in there.

01:55:43.671 --> 01:55:44.805
And then, afterwards,

01:55:44.972 --> 01:55:47.942
when he played it alone
with his finger...

01:55:48.075 --> 01:55:50.945
it-it hadn't been played
that way since Cliff.

01:55:51.078 --> 01:55:51.979
(imitating fast playing)

01:55:52.146 --> 01:55:53.781

Huh? (chuckles) Yeah.

01:55:56.650 --> 01:55:58.719
Yeah, his finger's
a pick, you know?

01:55:58.886 --> 01:56:01.689
Yeah. Yeah, it's three picks.
(imitates fast playing)

01:56:01.855 --> 01:56:04.725

want to sack Bob now?

offer you, uh, basically

01:57:02.049 --> 01:57:04.284

01:57:18.799 --> 01:57:20.434
Here's money up front.
Mm-hmm.

01:57:20.601 --> 01:57:22.102

Right.

about, you know, you and us

01:58:35.309 --> 01:58:39.313
and our future and all of that
stuff and... (clears throat)

01:58:39.480 --> 01:58:41.648
Uh, you know, when I heard
that you guys were moving here

01:58:41.815 --> 01:58:43.317
and all of that,
that brought up a lot

01:58:43.484 --> 01:58:47.654
of fear around, "Wow, what is
Phil's perception of, you know,

01:58:47.821 --> 01:58:51.492
his, you know, longevity
with Metallica?" You know?

01:58:51.658 --> 01:58:54.862
That scared me a little bit.
Well, I appreciate that. I w...

01:58:55.028 --> 01:58:56.730
I w... If it scared
you, and that's part

01:58:56.897 --> 01:58:58.832
of the-the issue
going forward,

01:58:58.999 --> 01:59:01.401
then let me say we haven't
decided we're moving here.

01:59:01.568 --> 01:59:02.703
I've tried
to make it clear

01:59:02.870 --> 01:59:05.906
that... that, urn,
we're selling...

01:59:06.073 --> 01:59:08.308
I think <i>pe...</i> uh, we've told
people we're selling our house

01:59:08.442 --> 01:59:10.878
in Kansas City, but that
doesn't mean we're moving here.

01:59:11.044 --> 01:59:12.246
Okay?

01:59:12.412 --> 01:59:16.216
And we won't likely move
to San Francisco if...

01:59:16.383 --> 01:59:20.020
if there's not a future
out there with Metallica,

01:59:20.187 --> 01:59:21.688
'cause it you know, that's my...

01:59:21.855 --> 01:59:24.358
I want to make sure that the...

01:59:24.525 --> 01:59:27.427
the bass player's intact, I want
to be sure that the tour's on,

01:59:27.594 --> 01:59:31.698
and I-And I also, as I said,
have performance coach visions

01:59:31.865 --> 01:59:33.500
for each of you
and for the band.

01:59:33.634 --> 01:59:36.570
And <i>I...</i> to me,
the work isn't over.

01:59:36.737 --> 01:59:38.839
Urn, I'd like us
to honor

01:59:38.972 --> 01:59:41.375
what we had, and...

01:59:41.542 --> 01:59:42.776
if you want to be away from...

01:59:42.943 --> 01:59:44.211
you know, on your own
or something,

01:59:44.378 --> 01:59:45.913
for the couple months that...
Right.

01:59:46.079 --> 01:59:47.848
You're heading back in June, then that's...
(chair scrapes)

01:59:47.981 --> 01:59:50.350
Then that's... Keep going back. Okay. I got...
I don't know, I guess I have

01:59:50.484 --> 01:59:52.686
a problem sometimes, Phil, with
the "let's see how it works out,

01:59:52.819 --> 01:59:54.421
let's see how it happens."
And then,

01:59:54.588 --> 01:59:55.956
"No, let's honor
what happened, you know,

01:59:56.123 --> 01:59:57.457
six months ago," you know?

01:59:57.624 --> 02:00:00.928
That-That's kind of strange
to me, you know?

02:00:01.094 --> 02:00:04.398
Because I think that
you use those things

02:00:04.565 --> 02:00:07.301
when they're convenient
at times, you know?

02:00:07.467 --> 02:00:10.437
Personal stuff
or business things and...

02:00:10.604 --> 02:00:13.774
I-I don't know, I don't know,
they're... the boundaries are...

02:00:13.941 --> 02:00:16.210
I don't know,
becoming more clear to me.

02:00:16.343 --> 02:00:18.412
Urn...

02:00:18.579 --> 02:00:21.582
There's-There's that
element of-of...

02:00:21.748 --> 02:00:23.717
trust that just kind of
floats with you, with me.

02:00:23.850 --> 02:00:24.918
And I... And that...

02:00:25.085 --> 02:00:26.453
I-I'm really
sorry about that.

02:00:26.620 --> 02:00:28.622
That-That. ..
you know.

02:00:28.789 --> 02:00:30.757
L-I been up... swimming uphill
on that one

02:00:30.924 --> 02:00:32.659
for a long time with you,
and I'd like...

02:00:32.826 --> 02:00:34.127
I'd like for us to be able

02:00:34.294 --> 02:00:36.063
to resolve it.
But maybe we can't.

02:00:36.196 --> 02:00:38.098
ULRICH: I've got to tell you
that I... You know,

02:00:38.265 --> 02:00:41.902
if the client-- either
James or us-- says...

02:00:43.103 --> 02:00:44.771
You know, then...

02:00:44.938 --> 02:00:49.142
I-I really think that needs
to be respected without...

02:00:49.309 --> 02:00:50.510
you know, just, you know,

02:00:50.677 --> 02:00:52.346
the old "turn the knife"
thing in there.

02:00:52.512 --> 02:00:54.514
You know, it just... it-it...
you know, if the client

02:00:54.681 --> 02:00:56.650
says, you know,
"Time out for a while"--

02:00:56.817 --> 02:00:59.286
time out. Yeah, <i>I...
</i> That is great.

02:00:59.453 --> 02:01:01.455
Although, with our process,
to honor what we usually do,

02:01:01.622 --> 02:01:04.258
we take... But then it
should be put on the table

02:01:04.391 --> 02:01:05.826
but left on the table.

02:01:05.993 --> 02:01:08.428
And should be able to walk away

02:01:08.562 --> 02:01:10.297
without what
you're saying right now,

02:01:10.464 --> 02:01:12.666
which is now there are
trust issues and stuff.

02:01:12.833 --> 02:01:15.302
I don't know how to separate...
separate out

02:01:15.469 --> 02:01:17.437
In its simplest form.
I ju... l-l think it's

02:01:17.571 --> 02:01:19.306
a conflict of interest
that you tell him

02:01:19.473 --> 02:01:21.174
that he needs you around more.
If he has...

02:01:21.341 --> 02:01:23.977
If he wants to take a break. No, no, no, no, no <i>.
</i> I'm not saying that.

02:01:24.144 --> 02:01:26.146
I'm saying... I just... I see
that as a conflict of interest.

02:01:26.313 --> 02:01:27.514
Look, I am saying
you guys

02:01:27.681 --> 02:01:29.816
have made a decision.

02:01:29.983 --> 02:01:33.854
It's okay for me to say I'm-I'm
not happy with that decision.

02:01:34.021 --> 02:01:37.991
The premise is you
guys don't need me.

02:01:38.158 --> 02:01:40.560
And-And I... I'm good with that.

02:01:40.727 --> 02:01:44.064
Anyway, you're going...
it's, uh...

02:01:44.831 --> 02:01:46.033
Anyway...

02:01:46.199 --> 02:01:47.634
let's jam.
Great, I'll see you guys.

02:01:47.768 --> 02:01:50.237
I'm taking off.
I'll see you, uh...

02:01:50.404 --> 02:01:51.838
next week.
Have a good one.

02:04:38.371 --> 02:04:39.739
I hear you.

02:04:39.906 --> 02:04:41.374
L-I, I like that
title quite a bit.

02:04:41.541 --> 02:04:44.010
It's so easy just to say
"June 17th is St. Anger's Day."

02:04:44.177 --> 02:04:45.912
Yeah, no, it's true, that's cool.
You know? I mean, it's...

02:04:46.079 --> 02:04:46.980
ULRICH:
I think "Frantic"

02:04:47.113 --> 02:04:49.015
is a better album title.

02:04:49.182 --> 02:04:50.350
I think that's...

02:04:50.517 --> 02:04:51.518
I don't know.

02:04:51.685 --> 02:04:53.520
...It's more
about the record.

02:04:53.687 --> 02:04:54.821
HAMMETT:
But St. Anger's a good...

02:04:54.955 --> 02:04:56.189
REITER:
It's an original statement.

02:04:56.356 --> 02:04:57.724
It's an original statement.
St. Anger, St. Anger.

02:04:57.891 --> 02:04:59.192
HETFIELD: Well, this is
an angry record...

02:04:59.359 --> 02:05:00.694
Right.
...but you read the lyrics,

02:05:00.861 --> 02:05:02.596
it's angry in a healthy way.
Right.

02:05:02.762 --> 02:05:05.198
Yeah, this is also a frantic record.
Getting stuff out.

02:05:05.365 --> 02:05:07.701
BURNSTEIN: Frantic is more like,
they're trying things

02:05:07.868 --> 02:05:09.035
that they don't, they don't...

02:05:09.202 --> 02:05:10.237
they're not exactly sure of.

02:05:10.403 --> 02:05:11.505
They don't know
what they're doing.

02:05:11.638 --> 02:05:13.940
They're trying to
climb back up the...

02:05:14.107 --> 02:05:15.609
the mountain again.
MENSCH: Right.

02:05:15.775 --> 02:05:17.344
They're not sure of themselves.

02:05:17.477 --> 02:05:18.578
I mean, we don't have to take it...
I mean, that's a fair...

02:05:18.745 --> 02:05:19.880
I mean hello, uh,
that's a fair thing.

02:05:20.046 --> 02:05:21.381
I mean, if you
think that "Frantic"

02:05:21.548 --> 02:05:23.717
has a negative
connotation to it,

02:05:23.884 --> 02:05:26.119
I never thought
of it like that.

02:05:26.286 --> 02:05:28.421
If it's St. Anger, they're
going to form an image of

02:05:28.588 --> 02:05:30.724
"These guys are angry,
I know it.

02:05:30.891 --> 02:05:33.293
"They're angry about Napster,
they're angry about

02:05:33.460 --> 02:05:34.761
"the new stuff that's coming in,

02:05:34.928 --> 02:05:36.463
"they're angry
about their lives.

02:05:36.630 --> 02:05:38.431
I'm angry, too. I get it."

Wow.

02:05:53.113 --> 02:05:56.116

aggressive music without

Yeah. Okay, and I don't
think anybody ever thought

02:08:25.732 --> 02:08:28.134
that that would be possible. Do
you know what I mean? Right.

02:08:28.301 --> 02:08:31.938
You can make something that's
aggressive and fucked up, okay?

02:08:32.105 --> 02:08:35.241
With positive energy between
the people creating it.

02:08:35.408 --> 02:08:37.410
HETFIELD:
Yeah.

02:08:37.577 --> 02:08:39.646
It hit me, you know?
This...

02:08:39.813 --> 02:08:41.881
project's coming to an end
and, I don't know,

02:08:42.015 --> 02:08:43.283
I think I'm kind of bummed
about that.

02:08:43.450 --> 02:08:45.085
I'm kind of just...

02:08:45.251 --> 02:08:49.222
kind of liking the schedule
that happens

02:08:49.355 --> 02:08:52.225
or the safeness in that.

02:08:52.358 --> 02:08:54.994
Coming here, being
able to talk, creating,

02:08:55.161 --> 02:08:57.897
you know? And...

02:08:58.031 --> 02:09:00.600
And, uh... I don't know.

02:09:00.767 --> 02:09:02.335
I've been kind of...

02:09:02.502 --> 02:09:06.005
coming down from this
for about the past month.

02:09:06.172 --> 02:09:09.309
I mean, getting up at 5:00
in the morning and just...

02:09:09.476 --> 02:09:11.277
pacing my apartment.

02:09:11.444 --> 02:09:14.981
Just not really knowing
what the hell I'm doing either.

02:09:15.148 --> 02:09:17.917
So I'm with you.

02:09:19.119 --> 02:09:21.588
Like, I don't want
to let you go home.

02:09:21.721 --> 02:09:23.590

02:09:23.723 --> 02:09:25.592
ROCK: (chuckles)
I really appreciate that.

02:09:25.725 --> 02:09:29.529
That's really nice
of you to say.

02:09:29.696 --> 02:09:31.798
HETFIELD: I don't know.
I could feel myself

02:09:31.965 --> 02:09:33.967
kind of protecting myself
with some depression

02:09:34.134 --> 02:09:38.638
or something,
wanting to just kind of isolate.

02:09:38.805 --> 02:09:40.640
And I don't want to do that.

02:09:40.807 --> 02:09:42.809
I want to feel the sadness of...

02:09:42.976 --> 02:09:45.678
I mean, I-l didn't feel
depressed, I felt sad.

02:09:45.845 --> 02:09:47.814
That's when I knew
it was something different

02:09:47.981 --> 02:09:52.118
than just me...
my old stuff, you know?

02:09:52.252 --> 02:09:55.455
I mean, there is
some of that, but...

02:09:55.588 --> 02:09:57.223
(chuckles)
Sadness

02:09:57.390 --> 02:10:01.995
and depression-- I guess I don't
really know the difference.

02:10:02.162 --> 02:10:06.065
And, Phil, all the stuff that
you've brought here to, like...

02:10:06.232 --> 02:10:09.836
You've set out
all the tools, you know?

02:10:10.003 --> 02:10:14.374
And you allowed us to build
what we've built, you know?

02:10:17.010 --> 02:10:19.412

02:10:19.579 --> 02:10:21.748

your bringing this forward.

02:10:24.117 --> 02:10:26.553

between sadness and depression.
