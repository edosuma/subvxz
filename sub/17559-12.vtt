00:05.338 --> 00:07.757
Ugh! They gave me custard!

00:07.841 --> 00:10.051
I ordered jelly.
I hate custard.

00:10.135 --> 00:12.554
- I love custard.
- Well, come on over.

00:13.930 --> 00:16.015
Oh, yeah, there you go.

00:17.600 --> 00:19.436
- So what are you writing?
- A letter to Henry.

00:19.519 --> 00:21.271
I haven't heard from him
in two weeks.

00:21.354 --> 00:23.606
Okay, it is not
in my nature to pry

00:23.690 --> 00:26.609
but why do you wanna be
friends with your ex-boyfriend?

00:26.693 --> 00:28.445
'Cause we were together
for a whole year

00:28.528 --> 00:30.697
and we kind of depend
on each other for, you know--

00:30.780 --> 00:32.365
Ooh, a little booty call?

00:34.117 --> 00:36.619
Are you talking about Henry?
She didn't like what I said.

00:36.703 --> 00:38.913
- Ooh, what did she say?
- To stay away from him.

00:38.997 --> 00:40.457
She told me the same thing
about the last guy

00:40.540 --> 00:41.791
I broke up with.

00:41.875 --> 00:44.043
He was married
and had a restraining order.

00:46.296 --> 00:48.465
I miss him.
I wonder if he's home.

00:50.091 --> 00:52.552
All I wanna do
is talk to Henry.

00:52.635 --> 00:54.304
You have this image
in your head

00:54.387 --> 00:55.764
of what it's gonna be like
when you see him

00:55.847 --> 00:57.098
that you're gonna be
all pals-y.

00:57.182 --> 00:58.808
Well, I'm sorry,
but he doesn't want

00:58.892 --> 01:00.518
to be pals with you
right now.

01:00.602 --> 01:02.103
I was talking to Lauren.

01:03.563 --> 01:05.063
Fine. I have
a headache anyway.

01:05.147 --> 01:06.983
Ooh, I know what'll help that.

01:07.066 --> 01:08.526
I got you
your chocolate-chocolate

01:08.610 --> 01:09.944
with chocolate sprinkles.

01:10.028 --> 01:11.488
No, thanks.

01:11.571 --> 01:13.823
What? No chocolate-chocolate
with chocolate sprinkles?

01:13.907 --> 01:15.450
Wait, let me feel your head.

01:15.533 --> 01:17.702
No, I'm fine. I just don't
want any chocolate.

01:17.786 --> 01:20.538
Oh, come on. Just eat it.
They always make bigger pants.

01:21.873 --> 01:23.875
No, it's-it's not that.

01:23.958 --> 01:26.252
Something happened.

01:26.336 --> 01:27.420
Come here.

01:28.880 --> 01:32.342
Okay, this does not
leave this room, alright?

01:33.885 --> 01:36.638
Last night, I ate
seven Mounds Bars.

01:38.056 --> 01:40.475
Ooh, how are we gonna
to sit on that story?

01:42.477 --> 01:44.813
The saddest part is
I don't even like Mounds Bars.

01:44.896 --> 01:47.065
Every bite, I was wishing
it was a Snickers.

01:48.233 --> 01:49.317
You know what you're doing?

01:49.400 --> 01:51.361
- You're sublimating.
- What?

01:51.444 --> 01:53.780
There's something missing,
sex, in your life

01:53.863 --> 01:56.574
and you are replacing it,
sex, with chocolate.

01:58.117 --> 01:59.536
It's not that.

01:59.619 --> 02:02.163
It's just,
I don't have a boyfriend

02:02.247 --> 02:03.790
Mounds Bar number one.

02:03.873 --> 02:05.625
This month's bills are due,
number two

02:05.708 --> 02:07.544
and then I looked
at our tiny client list

02:07.627 --> 02:08.544
number three.

02:08.627 --> 02:10.213
You said you ate seven.

02:10.295 --> 02:12.131
Mm, yeah,
those last four were

02:12.215 --> 02:15.218
"Holy crap, I just ate
three Mounds Bars."

02:15.301 --> 02:16.719
But you know what?

02:16.803 --> 02:19.597
Starting right now,
I am gonna stop eating sugar.

02:19.681 --> 02:21.891
I will have more energy,
I'll be focused

02:21.975 --> 02:25.061
and I won't wake up
with chocolate in my cleavage.

02:25.144 --> 02:26.729
I had no idea
you were so stressed.

02:26.813 --> 02:28.106
Is there anything I can do?

02:28.189 --> 02:30.024
Well, I was thinking
that maybe you could do

02:30.108 --> 02:31.901
the no-sugar thing with me,
you know?

02:31.985 --> 02:33.570
It's easier to stop
if you have a buddy.

02:33.653 --> 02:37.115
Mm, sorry, babe.
These are my sugar-eatin' years.

02:37.198 --> 02:40.118
You need a buddy?
I will be your buddy.

02:40.201 --> 02:41.703
We will stay strong together.

02:41.786 --> 02:45.248
Whenever you need me,
I will be there. No more sugar.

she told me she needed her space

04:02.075 --> 04:05.078
Well, she moved to Paris
and changed her phone number.

I just don't wanna be
one of those couples

that break up and then never
speak to each other again.

I have his jacket?

I wonder if he wants it back.

You talked to him?

that you've been talking
to him behind my back.

04:42.073 --> 04:43.533
What did he say?
Did he ask about me?

04:43.616 --> 04:45.535
Tell me everything that he said.

04:45.618 --> 04:48.037
Well, he said that
"If you see Holly

tell her I want my jacket back."

him wondering if he's okay

it would make you happy.

Us, too, huh, Henry?

09:15.805 --> 09:18.307
Yeah, what a surprise.

09:18.391 --> 09:20.101
I can't believe
you did this.

09:20.184 --> 09:22.311
- Did what, man?
- You set this up.

09:22.395 --> 09:24.105
You knew I didn't wanna see her.

09:24.188 --> 09:27.316
I set this up?
I set this up?

09:27.400 --> 09:28.776
How can you
accuse me of that?

09:28.859 --> 09:31.153
Holly, did I set this up?

09:31.237 --> 09:32.738
Yeah.

09:32.822 --> 09:35.199
Okay, I did set this up.
I set it up.

09:35.283 --> 09:38.661
I take responsibility for that.
But she made me.

09:38.744 --> 09:40.329
- Henry, wait.
- Wait, you've done enough.

09:40.413 --> 09:41.872
I'll handle this.

09:41.956 --> 09:44.250
Henry, I'm sorry, man.

09:44.333 --> 09:45.835
Holly, she's-she's
worried about you

09:45.918 --> 09:47.586
and she feels bad
about what happened.

09:47.670 --> 09:49.463
Good. She should feel bad.

09:49.547 --> 09:51.173
Come on, man.
Don't be like that.

09:51.257 --> 09:53.134
- She wants to talk to you.
- Oh, she wants to talk to me?

09:53.217 --> 09:54.385
She should have talked to me

09:54.468 --> 09:56.095
when she started having
feelings for Vince.

09:56.178 --> 09:58.639
That's what I've been telling
her for two months. I said--

09:58.723 --> 10:01.267
Whoa. Uh, two months?

10:01.350 --> 10:05.187
You've known about this thing
with Vince for two months?

10:05.271 --> 10:07.523
I'm sorry, what?

10:07.606 --> 10:11.527
You knew about Holly
having feelings for Vince.

10:11.610 --> 10:13.821
Holly has feelings for Vince?

10:13.904 --> 10:16.282
You knew all along,
and you didn't tell me?

10:16.365 --> 10:18.284
I-I'm sorry.
It-it's messed up.

10:18.367 --> 10:20.036
I-I didn't know
what to do, though.

10:20.119 --> 10:21.620
I mean, you're my friend,
Holly's my friend, and--

10:21.704 --> 10:24.165
Yeah, you are my friend
and if this had happened to you

10:24.248 --> 10:25.541
I would have told you.

10:25.625 --> 10:26.876
I wouldn't have let you
walk around

10:26.959 --> 10:30.004
looking like a fool
for two months.

10:30.087 --> 10:31.380
Aw, come on, man.

10:32.965 --> 10:34.216
Damn.

10:34.300 --> 10:35.968
Did you see that?
Now he's mad at me.

10:36.052 --> 10:38.471
- I know. I'm sorry.
- This is all your fault.

10:38.554 --> 10:39.889
I told you
I didn't wanna get involved

10:39.972 --> 10:41.390
but you kept pushing me.

10:41.474 --> 10:42.933
Okay, you know what?
I'm gonna go talk to him.

10:43.017 --> 10:44.894
No, no, no.
Stop talking to people.

10:44.977 --> 10:46.645
You've been so worried
about making it right with him

10:46.729 --> 10:47.855
you didn't think
about how it would affect

10:47.938 --> 10:49.273
my friendship with him.

10:49.357 --> 10:51.609
You know what?
Now you don't have me or him.

10:54.695 --> 10:58.157
[sighs]
Oh, my God.
I've never seen him like that.

10:58.240 --> 10:59.325
I know.

10:59.408 --> 11:01.827
Angry Gary is h-hot.

11:12.963 --> 11:15.091
All I tried to do
was stay friends with Henry

11:15.174 --> 11:16.717
and I asked Gary
for a little help

11:16.801 --> 11:19.470
but now Henry's mad at Gary
and Gary's mad at me.

11:19.553 --> 11:20.930
And I know
that I hurt Henry

11:21.013 --> 11:23.140
and I feel horrible
about that but I was just

11:23.224 --> 11:24.600
trying to put everyone
back together.

11:24.683 --> 11:26.352
Oh, Holly,
what have I been telling you?

11:26.435 --> 11:27.978
- Just leave it alone.
- I can't.

11:29.688 --> 11:31.190
Stop trying to fix things.

11:31.273 --> 11:32.525
I know, but I'm afraid

11:32.608 --> 11:33.984
that if I don't
do anything about it

11:34.068 --> 11:37.697
then he'll disappear,
and I want us to be friends.

11:37.780 --> 11:39.532
I understand.

11:39.615 --> 11:42.868
Like I want
that cake right now.

11:42.952 --> 11:45.287
But I know that right now,
the best thing for me to do

11:45.371 --> 11:47.957
would just be
to leave it alone.

11:48.040 --> 11:49.291
You're comparing a human being

11:49.375 --> 11:52.169
with human emotions
to a piece of cake?

11:52.253 --> 11:53.629
Henry is a great guy

11:53.712 --> 11:55.798
somebody who I thought
I could fall in love with.

11:55.881 --> 11:57.842
Now, well, I actually am
in love with that cake.

11:57.925 --> 11:59.051
[chuckles]

11:59.135 --> 12:02.012
Yeah, I am.
And, and, and I know

12:02.096 --> 12:03.639
that going after
that cake right now

12:03.722 --> 12:06.684
would be the wrong thing to do
because eventually

12:06.767 --> 12:09.061
that cake will have time
to sort out its feelings

12:09.145 --> 12:10.438
and that cake
will come to me

12:10.521 --> 12:12.565
and we will
be great friends again.

12:12.648 --> 12:14.817
Okay, you're just insane.

12:14.900 --> 12:17.403
Of course I am.
I haven't had sugar in 24 hours.

12:17.486 --> 12:18.821
This morning,
I stepped in gum

12:18.904 --> 12:21.323
and I almost licked
the bottom of my shoe.

12:23.075 --> 12:24.827
Look, I, I am still
smart enough to know

12:24.910 --> 12:27.246
that you just have to stop
trying to fix things.

12:27.329 --> 12:28.664
Okay? And leave Henry alone.

12:28.747 --> 12:30.791
Okay, but now it's not just
about me and Henry.

12:30.875 --> 12:32.042
It's about Gary and Henry

12:32.126 --> 12:34.003
and I have to try to fix
things between them.

12:34.086 --> 12:35.546
You're not listening to me.

12:35.629 --> 12:38.257
Everything was fine
between Gary and Henry, okay?

12:38.340 --> 12:40.718
Just, can't you just try
to stay out of it?

12:41.594 --> 12:43.179
Nah.

12:43.262 --> 12:44.430
I'm gonna go to bed

12:44.513 --> 12:47.725
but I hope that you and cake
patch things up.

12:54.190 --> 12:55.941
[sighs]

12:56.025 --> 12:57.193
Oh, no.

13:11.999 --> 13:13.083
Oh.

13:13.959 --> 13:15.878
Oh, I do love you.

13:18.506 --> 13:20.591
Oh, you're so good, hmm. Oh.

13:32.686 --> 13:34.188
Hey.

13:34.271 --> 13:35.898
Sit back down.
I wanna talk to you.

13:35.981 --> 13:37.983
I can take it from here.

13:38.067 --> 13:40.402
What? Wait.
You knew she was coming here?

13:40.486 --> 13:41.779
Does that make you mad?

13:43.489 --> 13:44.740
Look, I have
nothing to say to you.

13:44.823 --> 13:46.575
Well, I do. Sit down.

13:48.702 --> 13:50.538
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to drag you

13:50.621 --> 13:52.122
into this thing
between me and Henry.

13:52.206 --> 13:54.250
But I wanna make things right
between you guys

13:54.333 --> 13:55.626
so you can
stay mad at me, but--

13:55.709 --> 13:57.169
Yeah, how are you
gonna do that?

13:57.253 --> 13:58.587
I called Henry,
and I told him to meet me here

13:58.671 --> 14:00.130
so I could give him
his leather jacket.

14:02.508 --> 14:04.635
Yeah, and then
you guys can talk.

14:04.718 --> 14:06.804
Talk? Guys don't talk.

14:06.887 --> 14:08.681
And besides,
you saw how mad he was.

14:08.764 --> 14:10.891
He doesn't wanna have
anything to do with me.

14:12.560 --> 14:13.811
Henry, wait.

14:13.894 --> 14:16.438
You're really not
getting this, are you?

14:16.522 --> 14:17.815
I don't want to talk to you

14:17.898 --> 14:20.109
so stop trying to trick me
into doing it.

14:20.192 --> 14:22.361
I didn't trick you
into coming here to talk to me.

14:22.444 --> 14:26.240
I tricked you into coming here
to talk to Gary.

14:26.323 --> 14:28.701
Look, they tricked me too,
so since we're both here

14:28.784 --> 14:30.744
we might as well
work this thing out.

14:30.828 --> 14:33.330
Forget it. I take
my friendships very seriously.

14:33.414 --> 14:34.957
You should have
told me about Vince.

14:35.040 --> 14:36.959
That was my fault.
Don't blame Gary for that.

14:37.042 --> 14:39.712
Um, he was actually just being
a really good friend to me.

14:39.795 --> 14:41.630
Well, he wasn't being
a very good friend to me.

14:41.714 --> 14:44.216
And as far as I'm concerned
there is nothing you can say

14:44.300 --> 14:46.302
that will make that right.

14:46.385 --> 14:49.972
What if I said "I'll drink
that bottle of ketchup?"

14:50.055 --> 14:53.142
Gary, come on. What are you,
five? This is serious.

14:55.019 --> 14:57.104
You're right.

14:57.187 --> 14:58.981
I'll drink that ketchup,
eat 20 pats of butter

14:59.064 --> 15:01.859
drink that maple syrup,
and finish up that dijonnaise.

15:04.278 --> 15:05.696
You would do that for me?

15:14.246 --> 15:18.542
Okay, I have officially gone
24 hours with no sugar.

15:18.626 --> 15:20.294
I am so proud of myself.

15:20.377 --> 15:22.338
And it's not just the no sugar.

15:22.421 --> 15:26.300
I am one step closer
to actually achieving a goal.

15:26.383 --> 15:28.010
Thank you for making me wake up

15:28.093 --> 15:29.470
and discover
what it feels like

15:29.553 --> 15:31.972
to make a commitment
and stick to it.

15:32.848 --> 15:34.058
Yeah, well..

15:34.141 --> 15:36.185
- You know what I discovered?
- Hmm?

15:36.268 --> 15:37.645
They're putting
the peanut butter

15:37.728 --> 15:40.522
on the outside
of the peanut butter cup now.

15:40.606 --> 15:42.775
You cracked? You?

15:42.858 --> 15:44.193
I didn't just crack.

15:44.276 --> 15:49.239
I crunched, I licked,
I dipped and I sucked.

15:49.323 --> 15:50.991
I suck.

15:51.075 --> 15:53.786
How could you
eat all that sugar?

15:53.869 --> 15:56.497
At one point,
I unhinged my jaw like a snake.

15:58.040 --> 15:59.291
[sighs]
You know what you're
looking at?

15:59.375 --> 16:00.918
You're looking
at 30,000 calories

16:01.001 --> 16:02.419
worth of failure.

16:02.503 --> 16:04.797
All that stuff I told you
about focus and commitment

16:04.880 --> 16:07.341
and reaching your goals,
it means nothing now.

16:07.424 --> 16:09.009
The only valuable advice
I can give you

16:09.093 --> 16:11.970
is never chase a Twinkie
with a bottle of Yoo-hoo.

16:13.639 --> 16:15.516
Oh, God, I'm a failure.

16:15.599 --> 16:17.601
Oh, this is so typical you.

16:17.685 --> 16:19.520
You make one little mistake
and all of a sudden

16:19.603 --> 16:20.854
you're a failure.

16:20.938 --> 16:22.648
It wasn't
one little mistake.

16:22.731 --> 16:24.608
I must have eaten
over 200 Skittles.

16:26.652 --> 16:28.362
And you know what?
It didn't help anything.

16:28.445 --> 16:30.447
I mean, I don't have
any new clients

16:30.531 --> 16:33.117
I-I-I still have
a pile of bills

16:33.200 --> 16:35.703
and I didn't get
anywhere near a fella.

16:35.786 --> 16:38.247
Lighten up.
So you made a mistake.

16:38.330 --> 16:40.249
You cannot always be perfect.

16:40.332 --> 16:41.542
Why?

16:41.625 --> 16:44.169
I like being perfect.
It's what I do.

16:44.253 --> 16:46.255
I know it's annoying,
and people resent me for it

16:46.338 --> 16:48.757
but it's who I am.

16:48.841 --> 16:50.926
Now I don't
even have that.

16:51.009 --> 16:52.177
Who am I?

16:53.345 --> 16:55.305
You are my friend,
who made me

16:55.389 --> 16:58.350
really look at myself
for the first time.

16:58.434 --> 17:00.728
Seriously, I changed
because of you.

17:00.811 --> 17:03.605
I am gonna see something
through for the first time

17:03.689 --> 17:05.983
and I feel
really good about that.

17:06.066 --> 17:08.068
I guess that is
the most important thing.

17:08.152 --> 17:11.613
No, you know what is
the most important thing?

17:11.696 --> 17:14.366
It's for me to be able
to stand here and say to you

17:14.450 --> 17:17.661
for the first time
since I have known you..

17:17.744 --> 17:19.829
♪ I'm better than you are ♪

17:19.913 --> 17:21.790
♪ I'm better than you are ♪♪

17:21.874 --> 17:24.460
You have big flaws.
Yes, you do.

17:36.221 --> 17:37.931
[burps]

17:38.015 --> 17:39.224
Are we cool?

17:40.601 --> 17:41.935
Yeah, we're cool.

17:42.019 --> 17:43.896
[groans]

17:43.979 --> 17:45.814
Oh, save the hugging for later.

17:45.898 --> 17:47.858
I got to go
and de-condiment myself.

17:53.113 --> 17:54.281
Hey.

17:57.034 --> 17:58.660
Henry. Henry.

17:58.744 --> 18:00.162
Here you go.

18:00.245 --> 18:01.663
Thanks.

18:01.747 --> 18:02.706
Hey.

18:03.916 --> 18:05.334
If I drink
a bottle of ketchup

18:05.417 --> 18:07.628
will that make things okay
between us?

18:07.711 --> 18:09.588
Doesn't really work
that way.

18:09.671 --> 18:10.672
Fine, go.

18:10.756 --> 18:11.840
But I'm just gonna
follow you

18:11.924 --> 18:13.592
and keep talking
wherever you go.

18:13.675 --> 18:16.178
So you might as well
just stand here and talk to me.

18:16.261 --> 18:18.305
Okay, fine.
Holly, I really--

18:18.388 --> 18:20.974
I hate not having you
in my life.

18:21.058 --> 18:22.351
What I did was horrible and
I wish I could take it back

18:22.434 --> 18:23.352
but I can't.

18:23.435 --> 18:24.812
- No, you can't.
- I know.

18:24.895 --> 18:26.897
What do I expect you to do?
Just be pals again?

18:26.980 --> 18:29.024
- Act like nothing happened?
- That's what you're acting--

18:29.107 --> 18:31.360
You weren't just my boyfriend
you were my best friend.

18:31.443 --> 18:34.154
You are my best friend,
and I want you in my life.

18:34.238 --> 18:35.364
I know that
I'm your best friend, too

18:35.447 --> 18:37.074
which is why
this is killing you.

18:37.157 --> 18:39.159
- Look, I just want--
- No, I don't think you do.

18:39.243 --> 18:40.702
- Hey, can I just say--
- When people break up..

18:40.786 --> 18:42.621
They always say
they're gonna stay friends.

18:42.704 --> 18:45.082
- Will you just stop?
- But they never do--

18:45.165 --> 18:48.126
You want me to talk to you?
Okay, I'll talk to you.

18:48.210 --> 18:49.837
Did you ever think
for a second

18:49.920 --> 18:51.547
about what I might
be going through

18:51.630 --> 18:53.048
about what I'm feeling?

18:53.131 --> 18:54.842
You know,
this isn't all about you.

18:54.925 --> 18:56.760
- Well, I was just trying--
- I know, you wanna fix it.

18:56.844 --> 18:58.345
But you can't.

18:58.428 --> 19:01.056
It's not exactly pleasant for me
to be around you right now

19:01.139 --> 19:03.559
and I-I'm sorry
if you need to talk to me

19:03.642 --> 19:05.561
because you feel bad
about what happened.

19:05.644 --> 19:08.063
But stop calling
to see if I'm okay.

19:08.146 --> 19:10.607
When I am ready
to talk to you, I will.

19:13.902 --> 19:15.737
But I'm afraid you won't.

19:15.821 --> 19:17.656
Listen..

19:17.739 --> 19:18.907
...I do wanna
be friends with you.

19:18.991 --> 19:22.619
I just can't do it,
like...today.

19:24.079 --> 19:25.414
Okay?

19:25.497 --> 19:26.707
Okay.

19:31.837 --> 19:33.380
How's tomorrow looking?

19:40.679 --> 19:42.598
Everything okay?

19:42.681 --> 19:43.974
I think it will be.

19:44.850 --> 19:46.310
Good, good.

19:49.021 --> 19:51.273
Is everything okay with us?

19:51.356 --> 19:52.566
Uh, I don't know.

19:52.649 --> 19:54.276
You almost cost me
a good friendship.

19:54.359 --> 19:56.111
I know, and I'm sorry.

19:56.194 --> 19:58.488
Nah, you don't
have to apologize.

19:58.572 --> 20:00.949
But you do
have to drink this.

20:04.411 --> 20:06.121

20:17.799 --> 20:19.509
So, Henry told me
that when he was ready

20:19.593 --> 20:21.678
to talk to me,
he would talk to me.

20:21.762 --> 20:23.972
Isn't that kind of
what I told you?

20:24.056 --> 20:27.184
I don't know, whatever.
But you know, he was right.

20:27.267 --> 20:29.603
I mean, it was really selfish
of me to keep pushing him

20:29.686 --> 20:31.104
and I didn't even
think about that.

20:31.188 --> 20:33.148
He just needs his space.

20:33.231 --> 20:35.442
Okay, that is
exactly what I told you.

20:37.903 --> 20:39.196
Thank you.

20:39.279 --> 20:40.864
- What is that?
- Chocolate cake.

20:40.948 --> 20:42.658
I ordered it
when you went to the bathroom.

20:42.741 --> 20:45.327
No. No, no. Don't break now.
You're doing so good.

20:45.410 --> 20:47.496
Oh, but you broke down
and I know

20:47.579 --> 20:49.331
how much that's bothering you.

20:49.414 --> 20:51.375
It's okay.
I am back on track.

20:51.458 --> 20:53.335
I haven't had sugar
in almost eight hours.

20:53.418 --> 20:56.505
Yeah, I know, but that still
puts me a day ahead of you

20:56.588 --> 20:58.715
and if we're gonna be sugar-free
we have to do it together

20:58.799 --> 21:02.344
so if we eat this cake, we will
both be back at square one.

21:02.427 --> 21:03.762
- 'Are you sure?'
- 'Yeah.'

21:05.597 --> 21:07.641
- To buddies.
