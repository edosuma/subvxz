00:09.876 --> 00:14.046
<i>[Amy] I think whoever's here
is, like, frozen with terror.</i>

00:14.748 --> 00:18.250
They are making them
do bad things.

00:18.651 --> 00:19.952
How ya holdin' up?

00:19.954 --> 00:23.689
When your kids live
imprisoned in their rooms...

00:23.691 --> 00:26.658
What kind of life
are you giving them?

00:26.660 --> 00:30.696
I heard this scratching
on the very top of my door.

00:30.698 --> 00:34.033
I see doors opening.
Knobs turning.

00:36.836 --> 00:39.204
And it was just weeks
of mass slaughter.

00:39.839 --> 00:43.809
- But he wants to torture her.
- Why? She's 10 years old.

00:43.811 --> 00:46.378
I wanna hurt 'em.
Nobody messes with my kids.

00:47.647 --> 00:50.015
[Amy] Person's crying
up a storm.

00:50.017 --> 00:52.251
[Amy's voice distorted]
Crying up a storm.

00:53.987 --> 00:55.821
They want the person dead.

00:55.823 --> 00:57.189
My name is Amy Allan.

00:57.957 --> 00:59.024
I see dead people.

00:59.026 --> 01:01.427
I saw a winged creature.

01:01.995 --> 01:03.929
I speak to dead people.

01:03.996 --> 01:05.764
And they speak to me.

01:05.799 --> 01:08.500
This person feels
like a monster.

01:08.502 --> 01:11.070
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

01:11.072 --> 01:14.940
They are sucking the life
out of these people.

01:15.141 --> 01:16.642
I rely on my partner.

01:16.644 --> 01:17.943
I'm Steve DiSchiavi.

01:17.945 --> 01:19.845
I'm a retired New York City
homicide detective.

01:19.847 --> 01:21.914
So how many bodies we talkin'?

01:21.916 --> 01:25.984
And I know every person,
every house, has secrets.

01:25.986 --> 01:27.553
It's my job to reveal them.

01:27.555 --> 01:29.154
But Steve and I never speak.

01:29.156 --> 01:31.623
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:31.625 --> 01:32.758
Until the very end.

01:32.760 --> 01:34.760
Oh, you're not gonna like this.

01:34.762 --> 01:37.029
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

01:37.031 --> 01:39.264
I'm sorry. I need
to take a break.

01:39.499 --> 01:40.632
Or time to get out.

01:40.634 --> 01:44.002
It wants inside the house.
'Cause it wants to kill you.

01:56.416 --> 01:58.750
<i>[Steve] I'm in the beach town
of Wilmington, North Carolina.</i>

01:58.752 --> 02:01.787
<i>We got a desperate call
from a woman named Sarah.</i>

02:01.789 --> 02:06.959
<i>She terrified and says whatever's in
the house is going after her little girls.</i>

02:06.961 --> 02:09.428
Our daughters are no longer
safe in the house.

02:09.430 --> 02:11.063
They're both incredibly scared.

02:11.065 --> 02:14.099
And my husband and I don't
know how to protect them.

02:15.135 --> 02:16.602
<i>She told me the activity
is turning violent.</i>

02:16.604 --> 02:19.872
<i>And she adamant if Amy
and I can't find answers,</i>

02:19.874 --> 02:23.108
<i>it's just a matter of time before
someone gets seriously hurt.</i>

02:36.523 --> 02:38.123
<i>[Amy] So this is not good.</i>

02:39.092 --> 02:42.694
<i>Something very bad
happened in this area.</i>

02:42.696 --> 02:45.397
How it went down was not good.

02:46.666 --> 02:50.536
<i>I feel this heavy loss.
And then this anger.</i>

02:50.538 --> 02:56.108
The feeling here is there's
this impending doom.

02:56.110 --> 03:01.180
Like something horrible
is going to, like, happen.

03:10.623 --> 03:12.123
<i>[Steve] So, Sarah,
I'm glad I'm here.</i>

03:12.859 --> 03:16.161
'Cause, um, when we spoke, you
sounded pretty upset about what's going on.

03:16.429 --> 03:18.129
What-- What's happening?

03:18.131 --> 03:22.067
Things have escalated to a point where
nobody feels safe in the house anymore.

03:22.069 --> 03:25.270
And I feel as though my
children are being targeted.

03:25.772 --> 03:26.972
It's terrifying.

03:27.140 --> 03:28.173
How ya holdin' up?

03:28.875 --> 03:29.407
It's hard.

03:29.409 --> 03:32.244
It's hard because you...

03:33.213 --> 03:35.414
As a parent, that's,
like, your one job.

03:35.416 --> 03:36.148
Yeah.

03:36.150 --> 03:38.250
And when your kids come to you,

03:39.686 --> 03:41.220
and you can't fix it,

03:41.955 --> 03:45.624
and your kids live
imprisoned in their rooms,

03:45.626 --> 03:48.160
what kind of life
are you giving them?

03:49.529 --> 03:51.930
So Sarah, who all lives
in the house with you guys?

03:51.932 --> 03:53.899
- There are four of us in the house.
- Okay.

03:53.901 --> 03:54.967
So that's you obviously.

03:54.969 --> 03:56.868
This is my husband, Jonathan.

03:56.870 --> 03:58.937
That is my daughter, Mia.
She's 10.

03:58.939 --> 04:00.806
And that's Karyll. She's 15.

04:00.808 --> 04:02.441
How long have you guys
owned the place?

04:02.443 --> 04:04.443
We have been here for 13 years.

04:04.445 --> 04:07.546
- Was it always this bad that you needed to call us?
- No.

04:07.548 --> 04:11.583
Definitely within the last
two years, it's escalated.

04:11.585 --> 04:15.420
Drastically. To the point
where we don't know what to do.

04:15.422 --> 04:17.022
All right.
So Sarah, do me a favor.

04:17.024 --> 04:19.591
And give me a list of what the hell
you guys are going through here.

04:19.593 --> 04:21.927
- So we hear voices.
- Okay.

04:21.929 --> 04:23.996
<i>[Sarah] Things move
on their own.</i>

04:24.063 --> 04:26.632
<i>We experience mood changes.</i>

04:26.634 --> 04:27.899
<i>We have seen shadow figures.</i>

04:27.901 --> 04:31.436
And, most recently,
it's gotten physical.

04:31.438 --> 04:34.006
What kind of mood changes
are we talking about?

04:34.008 --> 04:37.042
Since living in this house. I
would say, the last few years.

04:37.044 --> 04:40.712
I've noticed that I can go
from zero to 100 in anger.

04:40.714 --> 04:41.847
For no reason.

04:41.849 --> 04:44.483
- So is that in your personality?
- No.

04:44.485 --> 04:46.718
What do you think whatever's
here wants from you guys?

04:46.720 --> 04:48.620
I think it's trying to make
me feel like I'm crazy.

04:48.622 --> 04:51.423
I think it wants to tear
my family apart.

04:51.425 --> 04:55.961
And I think that it wants
something to do with my children.

05:02.835 --> 05:04.603
What in the [beep]
is that damn thing?

05:04.605 --> 05:08.307
So there's something. And now
I'm seeing it, like, it's on the roof.

05:11.744 --> 05:15.280
But it's not just here. It does
go to other houses in the area.

05:17.550 --> 05:20.719
<i>So I'm seeing it jumping
from rooftop to rooftop.</i>

05:20.721 --> 05:22.954
- [cameraman] What is this thing?
- [Amy] Big.

05:22.956 --> 05:25.324
The thing's like
a good eight feet.

05:25.725 --> 05:27.759
Big. Massive.

05:27.761 --> 05:29.394
But smoky.
I mean, it is smoky.

05:29.729 --> 05:31.763
But it's massive.

05:31.765 --> 05:35.233
Is that, like, a dead person?
Like what the [beep]?

05:40.873 --> 05:44.042
All right. Kitchen obviously.
So, what's going on in here?

05:44.044 --> 05:45.977
So I was actually
in the kitchen.

05:45.979 --> 05:50.148
And these cabinet doors
open suddenly.

05:50.150 --> 05:52.617
And everything flew out
onto the floor.

05:52.619 --> 05:53.685
Okay.

05:53.687 --> 05:55.954
That sounds like something
out of a movie.

05:56.889 --> 05:59.124
- They don't open that easy.
- No.

06:00.927 --> 06:02.194
And they were wide open.

06:02.395 --> 06:03.261
Okay.

06:03.463 --> 06:04.730
What else?

06:04.732 --> 06:07.599
So we have flickering lights
in the hallway here.

06:07.601 --> 06:09.835
<i>And in the bathroom.</i>

06:09.837 --> 06:12.404
Doesn't mean it's paranormal. Did
you have an electrician look at it?

06:12.406 --> 06:14.005
My husband's actually
an electrician.

06:14.007 --> 06:16.341
- Oh. Okay. And he couldn't find something wrong?
- No.

06:16.809 --> 06:17.976
Anything else?

06:17.978 --> 06:21.513
What I find more... The
most serious is I have heard

06:21.515 --> 06:24.182
something trying to get
into my daughters room.

06:24.184 --> 06:28.286
<i>It was scratching at the door. And
then I heard the doorknob moving.</i>

06:29.088 --> 06:30.255
So what'd ya do?

06:30.257 --> 06:33.191
I didn't do anything. I was
frozen in fear in my bed.

06:33.193 --> 06:34.960
- Who's room was that in?
- Mia's.

06:34.962 --> 06:38.764
I'm now concerned that it's
gonna get physical with my kids.

06:38.766 --> 06:40.365
Well, that's what we don't want.

06:43.603 --> 06:46.371
<i>Eight-foot tall
black mass thing.</i>

06:47.473 --> 06:50.008
<i>Comes down through the closets.</i>

06:50.510 --> 06:54.446
<i>I literally see the door
opening and closing.</i>

06:54.448 --> 06:57.783
And they're perceiving
something coming out of it.

06:57.785 --> 07:00.719
<i>And it can affect
its physical surroundings.</i>

07:00.721 --> 07:04.689
Kind of like poltergeist activity.
But it's not really poltergeist.

07:04.691 --> 07:07.392
<i>Lights flickering
and [beep] like that.</i>

07:07.394 --> 07:10.395
I'm hearing banging on the wall.

07:10.397 --> 07:12.798
Hearing movement. Okay, okay.

07:12.800 --> 07:14.399
Doorknobs moving.
Doors moving.

07:15.468 --> 07:17.269
What the [beep]?

07:23.776 --> 07:26.111
So, Jon, I was talking
to your wife Sarah earlier.

07:26.113 --> 07:27.779
And she told me what was
going on in the house.

07:27.781 --> 07:29.614
And some insane stuff.

07:29.616 --> 07:30.949
Do you agree there's a problem?

07:30.951 --> 07:34.653
Absolutely, I mean, I've had
some physical things happen to me.

07:34.655 --> 07:37.222
Had a lot of experiences
I can't explain.

07:37.224 --> 07:39.324
Okay. Let's talk about your
experiences. What can you tell me?

07:39.326 --> 07:43.695
So I would say the most common one
that I notice is that I will hear noises.

07:43.697 --> 07:48.934
<i>Or if I'm in taking a shower it will sound
like somebody's coming through our back door.</i>

07:48.936 --> 07:52.270
The dogs will actually react
as if somebody has come in.

07:52.338 --> 07:53.671
Nobody's there.

07:53.673 --> 07:56.007
- And nothing's missing when you come back out?
- Absolutely no.

07:56.009 --> 07:57.809
So it doesn't look like you've been
burglarized and somebody left?

07:57.811 --> 07:59.311
- Not at all.
- Okay.

07:59.313 --> 08:01.446
All right. So you got
that going on. What else?

08:01.448 --> 08:06.818
Uh, there's a tall shadow figure that
goes by, right by this window over here.

08:06.820 --> 08:09.521
And as you can see. The window
is every bit of 10 foot off the ground.

08:09.523 --> 08:10.488
Right. Yes.

08:10.490 --> 08:12.257
So there's no shadow
that can come that high.

08:12.259 --> 08:15.160
And I will look out the window
and there is no cars.

08:15.162 --> 08:17.195
Is this something that you can
see through? Or is it pretty solid?

08:17.197 --> 08:18.797
It's solid dark.

08:18.799 --> 08:22.434
So, Jon, now that we're here. What
are you hoping we can get done for you?

08:22.436 --> 08:26.137
I'm hoping there is something
we can do to fight back.

08:26.139 --> 08:30.609
And I am definitely concerned about, you
know, the welfare of my youngest daughters

08:30.611 --> 08:32.277
and my wife of course.

08:37.383 --> 08:40.252
<i>[Amy] Mm.
Person's crying up a storm.</i>

08:40.853 --> 08:42.854
Crying up a storm.

08:42.856 --> 08:45.390
Think this is a female?

08:45.392 --> 08:47.392
Freakin' out seeing this thing.

08:48.661 --> 08:51.196
That door's open.
[Beep] opens doors man.

08:51.198 --> 08:54.099
Whatever the [beep] this is
I see door's opening.

08:54.567 --> 08:56.735
<i>Knobs turning.</i>

08:56.737 --> 08:59.104
What are the living seeing
within the closets?

08:59.438 --> 09:01.873
Uh, like closet doors opening.

09:01.875 --> 09:05.677
And, like, male looking,
you know, eight-foot tall thing.

09:05.744 --> 09:06.611
Black mass.

09:06.613 --> 09:08.947
And this is still
the same thing we're...

09:08.949 --> 09:12.951
- Running on the roofs and banging on the wall? Okay.
- Mm. Mm.

09:12.953 --> 09:16.121
Huh?
Are there two on the roof?

09:17.623 --> 09:20.392
<i>So now I'm wondering, like,
are there actually two</i>

09:20.394 --> 09:22.994
<i>dead men that are doing this?</i>

09:24.964 --> 09:26.364
And they're doing
some [beep] around here.

09:26.366 --> 09:30.402
So I think whoever's here
is, like, frozen with terror.

09:50.856 --> 09:53.224
<i>[Steve] Karyll, it's good
to sit down with you and talk.</i>

09:53.893 --> 09:55.460
Talked to Mom, talked to Dad.

09:55.462 --> 09:59.598
And they're both really concerned
about the safety of you and your sister.

09:59.600 --> 10:01.533
- Mm-hmm.
- Do you think they're over-reacting at all?

10:01.535 --> 10:02.701
I don't think they're
over-reacting.

10:02.703 --> 10:04.636
There's definitely
something paranormal here.

10:04.638 --> 10:07.639
So what kind of experiences
can you tell me about?

10:07.641 --> 10:11.610
Um, when I was home alone one time,
I started hearing tapping on my door.

10:11.612 --> 10:14.879
And it went from tapping,
to knocking, to banging.

10:14.881 --> 10:17.582
What did you do? I mean I would have
freaked out if I knew I was home alone.

10:17.584 --> 10:21.519
I freaked out. It went on for
probably about five minutes.

10:21.521 --> 10:25.357
And then after I went and opened
my door and there was nothing there.

10:25.359 --> 10:27.425
So is there anything else
you can tell me about?

10:27.427 --> 10:31.763
I have a really overwhelming
feeling that I'm being watched a lot.

10:31.765 --> 10:32.931
Where do you feel it?

10:32.933 --> 10:35.600
I feel it every time
I go into the bathroom.

10:35.602 --> 10:37.435
<i>I'm so scared to go in there.</i>

10:37.437 --> 10:40.605
<i>I always check the towel drawer.
And I check behind the shower.</i>

10:40.607 --> 10:43.942
Just like I feel, like, there someone,
like, standing there watching me.

10:43.944 --> 10:46.811
- Okay.
- It's like I don't know if they're gonna jump out at me.

10:46.813 --> 10:48.480
All right, so what else?

10:48.482 --> 10:53.151
One night, I saw a shadow figure
peering in at me through my bedroom door.

10:53.153 --> 10:55.920
Did you think it was somebody
like your Mom or Dad?

10:55.922 --> 10:56.354
I knew it wasn't.

10:56.356 --> 10:58.523
How come?

10:58.525 --> 11:00.759
I can always hear when they open their door
and come out in the middle of the night.

11:00.761 --> 11:04.062
And I can hear their footsteps
walking down the hall.

11:04.064 --> 11:06.798
How about physical attacks?
Any that you can remember?

11:06.800 --> 11:09.401
- No.
- What are your thoughts on what's here?

11:09.403 --> 11:10.468
What it wants?

11:10.470 --> 11:14.339
I think it wants to see us.
And possible harm us.

11:17.410 --> 11:20.712
The tall shadow things
like to come into this room.

11:20.714 --> 11:24.783
<i>I do see some
physical interaction.</i>

11:24.785 --> 11:29.721
So I think whoever's here
is, is getting attacked.

11:29.723 --> 11:31.556
Like physically.

11:31.558 --> 11:33.725
Like, I feel like this
person's been held down.

11:33.727 --> 11:36.428
Wrists. Feeling like
a male's hands.

11:36.996 --> 11:38.663
Did something to their leg.

11:38.665 --> 11:39.764
I think their right leg.

11:39.766 --> 11:42.300
But it hurt her leg really bad.

11:42.302 --> 11:47.839
<i>Things is, I don't know if the living
person even realizes it's happening.</i>

11:47.841 --> 11:50.508
[cameraman] Do you know why
these shadow things are doing this?

11:50.510 --> 11:53.945
The only thing I heard was,
"Because we can."

11:59.452 --> 12:01.720
<i>[Steve] So Mia, I was talking
to Mom today.</i>

12:01.722 --> 12:03.888
She tells me there's a lot of
scary stuff going on in the house.

12:03.890 --> 12:05.824
And she's worried about you.

12:05.826 --> 12:09.427
Yes, there's a lot
of stuff that's happened.

12:09.429 --> 12:11.663
It's definitely getting worse.

12:11.665 --> 12:14.766
So can you tell me about some
of the experiences you have?

12:14.768 --> 12:18.470
I heard this scratching on
the very top of my door.

12:18.472 --> 12:19.904
<i>I thought it was the cats.</i>

12:19.906 --> 12:23.708
But it was at the very top of
my door. And they couldn't reach.

12:23.710 --> 12:26.811
And then I heard, like,
a knocking on my door.

12:26.813 --> 12:30.048
- That would scare me.
- I was definitely scared.

12:30.050 --> 12:31.549
So anything else Mia?

12:31.551 --> 12:36.020
A few months ago I saw a tall dark
shadow figure standing in my living room.

12:36.022 --> 12:38.256
I actually drew a sketch of it.

12:40.693 --> 12:41.392
You drew this?

12:46.665 --> 12:48.099
Well, that's pretty creepy.

12:49.301 --> 12:52.704
It was very tall.
I remember that.

12:52.706 --> 12:56.775
Mom mentioned to me that, um,
she gets angry for no reason real fast.

12:56.777 --> 12:58.743
Does anything like that
happen to you?

12:58.745 --> 13:03.281
Yes. There's sometimes that
I just feel angry for no reason.

13:03.283 --> 13:06.151
I'll just be angry out of
nowhere and I don't know why.

13:06.153 --> 13:09.053
You think it's the, the paranormal
stuff that's going on here?

13:09.055 --> 13:10.054
Yes.

13:10.189 --> 13:11.256
Okay.

13:12.591 --> 13:13.992
[Amy] What?

13:21.400 --> 13:24.202
<i>Those tall shadow things
come in this room too.</i>

13:26.405 --> 13:28.740
I'm hearing a lot of yelling
and stuff in this room.

13:28.742 --> 13:33.645
The living here are hearing, like, male
voices saying really awful things to them.

13:33.647 --> 13:37.782
Like I'm hearing,
"You [beep] bitch."

13:37.784 --> 13:41.386
I'm wondering if they're,
like, jumping this person.

13:46.692 --> 13:52.163
Making them do bad things.

13:53.132 --> 13:55.233
And what kind of experience
is it for them?

13:55.901 --> 13:56.834
Depends.

13:56.836 --> 13:58.636
Uh, it could be that
they're blacked out.

13:58.638 --> 14:01.372
And they have no control
over what they're doing.

14:01.374 --> 14:08.012
And they're making this person
do, or say, or act abnormally.

14:08.014 --> 14:13.384
Uh, so it's harming them more mentally and
psychologically. Well, and physically really.

14:13.386 --> 14:15.186
Than just beating on them.

14:20.659 --> 14:24.095
Like that's, like,
their torture.

14:37.810 --> 14:41.479
<i>[Steve] I always start my investigations
by calling local law enforcement.</i>

14:41.481 --> 14:44.349
<i>Turns out, an 18-year-old
girl was murdered</i>

14:44.351 --> 14:46.451
<i>just down the street from
Sarah and Jonathan's house.</i>

14:46.453 --> 14:49.821
<i>It's a pretty recent case. So the
cops didn't want to talk to me about it.</i>

14:49.823 --> 14:53.224
<i>But, I found a true crime author
who said this brutal homicide</i>

14:53.226 --> 14:55.994
<i>happened because
of a deadly obsession.</i>

15:03.168 --> 15:06.571
<i>So Rick, I appreciate you meeting with
me and helping me out with this case.</i>

15:06.573 --> 15:10.241
So before we get into what happened.
What'd you find out about the victim?

15:10.243 --> 15:13.011
Our victim's name
is Jessica Faulkner.

15:13.013 --> 15:17.715
She's an 18-year-old college sophomore
here at our local college, UNC Wilmington.

15:17.717 --> 15:21.953
She lives in a dorm actually only about
3000 feet from your clients residence.

15:21.955 --> 15:25.523
Okay. So Rick, do we know
anything about the guy who killed her?

15:25.525 --> 15:27.258
Yeah, 21-year-old Curtis Dixon.

15:27.260 --> 15:29.560
He was actually a college
student also there.

15:29.562 --> 15:34.732
At UNC Wilmington, he lived on
the same floor as her in the dorm.

15:34.734 --> 15:38.269
Okay. So now the two of them are
living on the same floor in this dorm.

15:38.771 --> 15:39.537
What happens next?

15:39.539 --> 15:41.673
They actually became friends.

15:41.675 --> 15:44.943
But, this soon became
an obsession for, uh, Dixon.

15:44.945 --> 15:47.245
He started taking
the same classes as her.

15:47.247 --> 15:50.682
Started making romantic
advances towards her.

15:50.684 --> 15:54.285
Uh, even though, you know, she made
it pretty clear that she had a boyfriend.

15:54.287 --> 15:56.054
And was not interested.

15:56.056 --> 15:59.023
Okay, we're sitting here because
she was murdered. So what happened?

15:59.025 --> 16:01.960
So, May 4th, 2004.

16:01.962 --> 16:04.095
Jessica got a text from Curtis.

16:04.097 --> 16:07.432
Asking her to come back to his room.
Because he said he had a gift for her.

16:07.434 --> 16:08.733
So, what happened?

16:08.735 --> 16:12.403
He tells her to turn her back
on him. So he can surprise her.

16:12.405 --> 16:16.574
When she does, strangles her
down to the ground.

16:16.576 --> 16:20.511
Proceeds to rape her. Then tie
her to his bed and goes to sleep.

16:20.513 --> 16:22.647
- And he goes to sleep?
- Just goes to sleep.

16:22.649 --> 16:25.717
- This guy's a real sociopath, right?
- Yeah, absolutely.

16:25.719 --> 16:27.618
All right. So we know he's been
arrested. How'd that all happen?

16:27.620 --> 16:29.988
He called her father.

16:29.990 --> 16:33.758
And then turned himself into
the police. So, here's his mugshot.

16:33.760 --> 16:36.694
That's unbelievable. I've never
heard of something like this.

16:36.696 --> 16:39.364
Calls the father and says,
I just killed your daughter.

16:39.366 --> 16:40.832
- Can you imagine getting that phone call?
- I can't.

16:40.834 --> 16:43.735
As a dad, I just cannot
imagine having that phone call.

16:43.737 --> 16:47.105
Mm. All right.
So, did it go to trial?

16:47.107 --> 16:48.439
I mean, did he
cop out a plea, or?

16:48.441 --> 16:51.309
Actually, no. He actually
never made it to his trial.

16:51.311 --> 16:56.547
On December 10th, 2004 he was able to
break away from his correctional officer.

16:56.549 --> 17:00.985
Ran up the stairs of a cell block, he
got to the third deck and jumped off.

17:00.987 --> 17:04.555
Landed head first down on the
bottom. And died the next day.

17:04.557 --> 17:06.257
Took the coward's way out.

17:06.259 --> 17:10.328
Yes, Steve. By taking his own
life, he did manage to escape justice.

17:12.731 --> 17:17.902
<i>[Amy] I think those tall shadow
figures were bad people in life.</i>

17:17.904 --> 17:20.738
I feel like they're criminals.
Like, they're criminals.

17:20.740 --> 17:24.075
These guys are way more recent.

17:24.077 --> 17:28.446
I wouldn't go earlier than the
'90s... 1990s with these guys.

17:28.448 --> 17:30.715
One of these dead males is big.

17:30.717 --> 17:34.285
Like, I think this guy
was, like, a big guy in life.

17:36.789 --> 17:39.791
Some kind of body builder or
something. You know, he was built.

17:39.793 --> 17:43.928
And I'd put him in his
30s maybe, late 30s.

17:43.930 --> 17:48.166
The other one I get younger.
Much younger. Early 20s maybe.

17:50.436 --> 17:54.772
They have this, like, vibe about
them. That they think they escaped.

17:54.774 --> 17:58.342
So, like, I'm like, y'all know
you're, you know, dead?

17:58.344 --> 18:00.978
Maybe they think they
escaped through death.

18:00.980 --> 18:03.648
I'm wondering if, like, these
are people who, like, actually

18:03.650 --> 18:05.249
did, like, escape jail
or something.

18:05.684 --> 18:07.585
That their ego is way too big.

18:07.587 --> 18:11.456
Or maybe they [beep] did something
and got killed before they went to jail.

18:11.458 --> 18:15.426
So they feel free. Like, there's gotta
be something behind their ego on this.

18:20.432 --> 18:22.099
<i>[Steve] So I'm heading over
to meet a local professor.</i>

18:22.101 --> 18:25.570
<i>She tells me Sarah and Jonathan's
house only had one previous owner.</i>

18:25.572 --> 18:29.240
<i>And his life was cut short
way too soon.</i>

18:36.582 --> 18:39.750
<i>So, Professor thanks for meeting with
me and helping me out with this case.</i>

18:39.752 --> 18:43.621
<i>Before we get to the death, do you
know anything about the previous owners?</i>

18:43.623 --> 18:45.990
They were Anthony
and Eugenia Mazur.

18:45.992 --> 18:47.625
And they bought
the house in 1956.

18:47.627 --> 18:50.094
- Okay.
- This will be photos of them.

18:50.096 --> 18:51.629
[Steve] Okay. And are they
the first people to live there?

18:51.631 --> 18:54.198
[Angie] They were. And they
lived there for about 20 years.

18:54.200 --> 18:57.702
Okay. So now it's 1956.
They're living in my client's house.

18:57.704 --> 18:58.803
Is it just the two of them?

18:58.805 --> 19:01.672
For a while, yeah, and
then they have a daughter.

19:01.674 --> 19:03.674
So they all lived in the house
that your clients lived in.

19:03.676 --> 19:06.577
And Anthony worked in the oil
industry here in Wilmington.

19:06.579 --> 19:09.747
Okay. So, let's move on.
What about the death?

19:09.749 --> 19:13.551
In April of 1977, he was
diagnosed with meningitis.

19:13.553 --> 19:17.788
It's an infection that attacks
the brain and the spinal cord.

19:17.790 --> 19:22.426
So, as you can imagine, he's got
pain. He's got dizziness, nausea,

19:22.428 --> 19:23.861
- a lot of suffering.
- Yeah.

19:23.863 --> 19:25.830
The condition eventually got
a lot worse.

19:25.832 --> 19:28.399
And so the family had
to rush him to the hospital.

19:28.401 --> 19:31.068
And once he was there,
he died six days later.

19:31.070 --> 19:32.703
And I've got
the death certificate.

19:32.771 --> 19:35.139
Wow. He was only 56 huh?

19:35.141 --> 19:37.808
- Yeah. It was devastating for Eugenia.
- What happens with her?

19:37.810 --> 19:39.810
Well, she wants to stay there
as long as she can.

19:39.812 --> 19:41.979
And so she gets help
from her daughter, Peggy.

19:41.981 --> 19:43.748
- Okay.
- So they're there until 2008.

19:43.750 --> 19:45.416
And then the house was sold.

19:45.418 --> 19:48.619
-To my clients.
-That's right. To your clients Sarah and Jon.

19:48.621 --> 19:52.056
And then, Eugenia will live for
another five years here in Wilmington.

19:52.058 --> 19:53.391
And she dies at the age of 89.

19:53.692 --> 19:55.126
Okay.

19:57.362 --> 20:01.866
Quick image of a, I believe a
male laying dead on the floor.

20:01.868 --> 20:05.536
The guy's wearing just, like,
a wife beater and boxers.

20:05.538 --> 20:09.941
And he's kind of,
uh, heaver set.

20:09.943 --> 20:14.078
He's probably, like, in his,
I'd put him in his 50s.

20:14.179 --> 20:16.681
I see, like, brown hair.

20:16.683 --> 20:21.185
I think he just dropped dead. You know, so
like, it could be aneurysm, heart attack.

20:26.425 --> 20:30.127
What you feel is anger.

<i>So far I've got clients terrified something
evil is going after their daughters.</i>

21:00.860 --> 21:04.262
<i>Right near the scene of a brutal
murder of an 18-year-old girl.</i>

21:04.264 --> 21:06.264
<i>But, I wanna see
if there's anything else.</i>

21:07.666 --> 21:11.335
<i>Searching through the archives,
I found out that in the late 1800s</i>

21:11.337 --> 21:14.605
<i>the streets of Wilmington were
turned into a bloody war zone.</i>

21:14.607 --> 21:18.709
<i>I gotta admit, I've never heard of the
Wilmington Massacre until just now.</i>

21:18.711 --> 21:23.014
<i>But I tracked down a local historian
who actually made a documentary about it.</i>

21:23.548 --> 21:28.152
<i>You had armed bands of Whites
who were roaming the city.</i>

21:28.154 --> 21:31.689
<i>Indiscriminately killing Black
people. It was a slaughter.</i>

21:31.691 --> 21:36.327
<i>[Steve] And apparently, it was the
only successful coup d'etat in US history.</i>

21:43.268 --> 21:44.835
[Steve] So Chris, <i>thanks for
helping me out and meeting with me.</i>

21:44.837 --> 21:46.604
<i>I appreciate that.</i>

21:46.606 --> 21:47.905
So I've done a lot of history
in North Carolina.

21:47.907 --> 21:51.108
But I never knew about
this part of American history.

21:51.110 --> 21:53.844
So set the scene for me.
What was this all about?

21:53.846 --> 21:58.816
Well, after the Civil War, Wilmington
became, like, a mecca for African Americans.

21:58.818 --> 22:01.786
So you had several lawyers
here. Um, Black doctors.

22:01.788 --> 22:03.754
You had a Black-owned newspaper.

22:03.756 --> 22:06.991
And so Wilmington became
really what the new South

22:06.993 --> 22:08.726
could have been
after the Civil War.

22:08.728 --> 22:10.461
So, what went wrong?

22:10.463 --> 22:16.033
Well, what went wrong was that you
had a White supremacy movement.

22:16.035 --> 22:19.403
And you had a group of nine
wealthy businessmen in Wilmington

22:19.405 --> 22:21.672
who called themselves
The Secret Nine.

22:21.674 --> 22:24.408
And what they wanted to do
was really bring Wilmington,

22:24.410 --> 22:26.277
and the whole state
of North Carolina,

22:26.279 --> 22:30.514
back to that era of White
supremacy prior to the Civil War.

22:30.516 --> 22:34.785
All right, so we got these secret
nine white guys. What'd they do?

22:34.787 --> 22:39.590
Well, the first thing they wanted to do was
spread a lot of misinformation and lies.

22:39.592 --> 22:41.459
So they used a lot
of political cartoons

22:41.461 --> 22:46.564
that made African Americans look like beasts
and monsters. Of attacking white women.

22:46.566 --> 22:49.600
The whole meaning behind it was
that if we let these African Americans

22:49.602 --> 22:53.404
continue to be in politics
and continue to get power,

22:53.406 --> 22:55.873
they're gonna come after your daughters,
they're gonna come after your wives.

22:55.875 --> 22:57.675
So they preyed on their fears.

22:57.677 --> 22:58.809
- Right. Right.
- Basically.

22:58.811 --> 23:01.679
All right. So, we got
the propaganda going on.

23:01.681 --> 23:03.447
How's it go from that
to a massacre?

23:03.449 --> 23:05.683
Well, on November 10th, 1898,

23:05.685 --> 23:09.787
you had about a couple of
hundred, um, White citizens.

23:09.789 --> 23:14.658
And they wanted to first, eliminate
the Black press in Wilmington,

23:14.660 --> 23:16.394
which was
<i>The Wilmington Daily Record,</i>

23:16.396 --> 23:18.863
owned by
African American, Alex Manly.

23:18.865 --> 23:24.034
This mob, which grown to
about 2000 people, burnt it down.

23:24.036 --> 23:26.937
Stood in front of it.
Took pictures.

23:26.939 --> 23:28.339
- This is it here?
- Yeah.

23:29.074 --> 23:30.441
Holy [beep] look at these guys.

23:30.842 --> 23:32.476
What happens next?

23:32.478 --> 23:35.646
Then they broke off in patrols
throughout the city.

23:35.648 --> 23:38.549
Killing African Americans.
Men, women, and children.

23:38.551 --> 23:42.052
And it was just weeks
of mass slaughter.

23:42.054 --> 23:44.455
Here's an article
about the massacre.

23:44.457 --> 23:47.057
So how many people got killed?

23:47.059 --> 23:50.528
I would say the range of
African Americans that were killed

23:50.530 --> 23:52.930
ranged from about 30 to 300.

23:52.932 --> 23:54.865
Okay. So we really don't know
what the exact number is?

23:54.867 --> 23:56.400
- No.
- Okay.

23:56.402 --> 23:58.269
What happens after
the killing stops?

23:58.271 --> 24:00.771
They decide to take over
the government.

24:00.773 --> 24:02.640
They removed the mayor,
removed the alderman.

24:02.642 --> 24:04.842
And they were taken out
forcibly, I'm assuming.

24:04.844 --> 24:09.280
Yeah by force. By the gun. Either
you do this, or we're gonna kill ya.

24:09.981 --> 24:11.749
Does anybody get arrested
for what happened?

24:11.751 --> 24:14.819
No. Nothing happens to anyone.

24:14.821 --> 24:17.688
This is a real stain
on the Wilmington history.

24:17.690 --> 24:21.959
Yeah, it's been a stain in this
city for, for quite some time.

24:21.961 --> 24:24.328
And the city is still dealing
with that still today.

24:25.931 --> 24:28.399
So weird.

24:28.401 --> 24:31.202
I'm getting that feeling
of impending doom again.

24:33.472 --> 24:38.042
You know I have the impression
of a house.

24:39.177 --> 24:44.482
But it's like two stories. White.
Older style looking house.

24:44.484 --> 24:45.749
[cameraman] Any idea
when this was?

24:45.751 --> 24:49.987
I wanna say it's, like,
1850s the earliest.

24:49.989 --> 24:53.657
Clearly got 1875.
I clearly got 1895.

24:53.692 --> 24:56.560
Uh, as very specific dates.

24:56.562 --> 25:01.932
<i>And I did hear many people
marching in the distance.</i>

25:02.667 --> 25:06.570
This impending doom
is associated with

25:06.572 --> 25:12.176
whatever the [beep] went on
with the disposal of that house.

25:12.178 --> 25:16.280
There seem to be some kind
of, like, big thing that went down.

25:16.282 --> 25:18.382
And then the loss of the house.

25:18.384 --> 25:20.651
There's something
disturbing about it.

25:20.653 --> 25:21.852
It's sad.

25:21.854 --> 25:24.088
So what kind of effect
would this have on people?

25:24.090 --> 25:27.691
I believe that they would feel
extremely stressed out.

25:27.693 --> 25:32.263
They feel like they're gonna
lose their home. Or their land.

25:33.965 --> 25:37.001
This doom is gonna happen
and they're gonna lose everything.

25:37.003 --> 25:40.037
Like, it's always kind
of like right there.

25:40.039 --> 25:44.408
It's so heavy
on their shoulders.

25:44.410 --> 25:47.311
And it's coming out in anger.

25:54.352 --> 25:57.488
<i>I saw several disturbing
things on my walk.</i>

25:57.490 --> 26:03.127
But the tall shadow figure jumping a living
girl in her bedroom concerns me the most.

26:03.129 --> 26:06.764
She's in the bed
and she's on her left side.

26:06.766 --> 26:09.633
This guy is by the bed.

26:09.635 --> 26:12.836
Probably about seven feet tall.

26:12.838 --> 26:17.041
There's a lot of mist
surrounding his form.

26:18.743 --> 26:20.244
It's a lighter color.

26:24.816 --> 26:28.218
Amy, is this what you saw?

26:28.353 --> 26:30.354
Yes, that's what I saw.

26:50.742 --> 26:53.877
<i>[Steve] Now that Amy and I
have completed our investigations,</i>

26:53.879 --> 26:56.614
<i>we're ready to reveal our
findings to each other.</i>

26:56.616 --> 26:58.382
<i>And our clients
for the first time.</i>

26:58.817 --> 27:00.517
So guys, I'd like
you to meet Amy.

27:00.519 --> 27:02.686
She's gonna be doing
the reveal from another room

27:02.688 --> 27:06.457
so she can concentrate on your case
and the dead without any distractions.

27:06.459 --> 27:08.592
Amy, this is Sarah
and her husband Jon.

27:08.594 --> 27:11.629
They live in this house
with their two daughters.

27:11.631 --> 27:16.467
This is Karyll over here,
who's 15.

27:16.469 --> 27:19.503
And this is Mia, here, who's 10.

27:19.505 --> 27:22.640
- Now, they've lived in this house for 13 years?
- Yes.

27:22.642 --> 27:25.542
But recently all hell's
broken lose here.

27:25.544 --> 27:29.813
Sarah says that whatever's
here is going after her girls.

27:29.815 --> 27:32.049
So unless Amy's got some
questions for you guys,

27:32.051 --> 27:34.051
uh, she'll tell us
about her walk.

27:36.721 --> 27:39.390
So when I first started my walk,

27:39.392 --> 27:41.925
I walked out into the back yard.

27:41.927 --> 27:44.762
I became extremely overwhelmed

27:44.764 --> 27:49.700
by a strong sense
of impending doom.

27:49.702 --> 27:55.239
And this is affecting actually
quite a large area.

27:55.241 --> 27:57.775
Uh, so not just your property.

27:57.777 --> 28:04.615
And it's so strong that I do feel
like it's influencing people here.

28:04.617 --> 28:08.886
Making them feel very
stressed out, very anxious.

28:08.888 --> 28:14.425
Being consistently exposed to that,
it's all turning into, like, this anger.

28:14.427 --> 28:17.327
I felt like it could
become abusive.

28:17.329 --> 28:20.798
Like somebody becoming,
like, lashing out.

28:20.800 --> 28:25.669
I will experience anger that
literally just comes out of nowhere.

28:25.671 --> 28:28.005
And it's zero to 100.

28:28.007 --> 28:30.708
We will remove ourselves
from the immediate area,

28:30.710 --> 28:34.912
and it seems like
it immediately de-escalates.

28:34.914 --> 28:37.581
So, you get any sense where
all this doom is coming from?

28:37.583 --> 28:38.782
Yes.

28:38.784 --> 28:41.652
<i>There was a house
that use to be around here.</i>

28:41.654 --> 28:44.722
Something really awful happened.

28:44.724 --> 28:47.891
Involving this house
and this land.

28:47.893 --> 28:51.995
And it was an event. And it
never should have happened.

28:51.997 --> 28:58.368
I got 1875 and 1895 were the
two years that were very specific.

28:58.370 --> 29:02.306
And I did hear men
marching in the distance.

29:02.308 --> 29:06.143
You said a few things that make me think
of a massacre that took place right here.

29:06.145 --> 29:11.415
In the late 1800s, Wilmington
was ground zero for the country's

29:11.417 --> 29:13.951
only successful coup.

29:13.953 --> 29:17.454
So at that time there was a lot of
prosperity for the Black community down here.

29:17.456 --> 29:19.123
Uh, and they did well.

29:19.924 --> 29:22.726
But there was a faction of
white men in town that had money

29:22.728 --> 29:24.995
that this didn't sit well with.

29:25.363 --> 29:27.731
And they called themselves
The Secret Nine.

29:27.733 --> 29:33.737
Now, Amy, you said 1895. But this
happened on November 10th, 1898.

29:33.739 --> 29:36.974
First a group of white
businessmen and veterans

29:36.976 --> 29:40.410
armed to the teeth marched to
the only Black newspaper in town.

29:40.412 --> 29:43.981
Um, they burned
the place to the ground.

29:43.983 --> 29:47.317
I have a photo of
the day this happened.

29:47.319 --> 29:50.020
The crowd swelled to about 2000.

29:50.022 --> 29:54.024
They spread out all over town
killing black men, women, and children.

29:54.026 --> 29:55.659
[beeping]

29:55.661 --> 29:58.128
When all was said and done,
at the end of the day,

29:58.130 --> 30:02.232
between 30 and 300 black men
and women were killed.

30:02.234 --> 30:07.805
After that, this crowd of men, wind up
marching to the homes of city officials.

30:07.807 --> 30:11.575
And, basically forced them
to resign at gunpoint.

30:11.577 --> 30:14.511
And installed their
own new government.

30:14.513 --> 30:16.580
No one was ever
arrested and charged.

30:16.582 --> 30:20.517
Could this deadly coup be
what caused this feeling of doom?

30:20.519 --> 30:25.289
More than likely, because
that did affect quite a large area.

30:27.525 --> 30:30.894
<i>[Steve] Okay, so what else
happened on the walk?</i>

30:30.896 --> 30:37.568
When I was outside, I saw two
8-foot tall, like, shadow figures.

30:37.570 --> 30:41.405
Then I realized that
it's two dead males.

30:41.407 --> 30:44.942
Initially, I saw them
up on the roof.

30:44.944 --> 30:47.277
And I saw them banging
on the wall,

30:47.279 --> 30:49.713
I think near a window.

30:49.715 --> 30:51.782
So, as you're looking
at our fireplace,

30:51.784 --> 30:53.784
we have the two windows,
on either side.

30:53.786 --> 30:57.621
It's always the window to
the left, as you're looking at it.

30:57.623 --> 30:59.556
You always catch it
out of the corner of your eye,

30:59.558 --> 31:01.758
but when you try to focus,
it's gone.

31:01.760 --> 31:05.596
I saw them entering your
house, through the closets.

31:05.598 --> 31:08.599
They can affect
their physical surroundings

31:08.601 --> 31:13.303
I saw lights going on and off
by themselves, or flickering,

31:13.305 --> 31:17.608
doorknobs turning and
doors opening and closing.

31:17.610 --> 31:24.147
Cabinet doors will fly open,
dishes will fly out of the cabinets.

31:24.149 --> 31:28.919
I, myself, have heard the
doorknobs, the banging.

31:28.921 --> 31:32.356
And we've had issues
with the lights flickering.

31:33.391 --> 31:35.592
Tell Amy
about when you're home alone,

31:35.594 --> 31:37.394
but it sounds like someone's
walking in the house.

31:37.396 --> 31:40.530
Yeah. So, I mean,
it's only when I'm home alone.

31:40.532 --> 31:44.167
I'll hear what sounds like my
wife or kids coming in the back door

31:44.169 --> 31:46.370
and I just peek out and go,
"Yeah, nobody there. Okay."

31:46.372 --> 31:47.838
I just go back
to what I'm doing.

31:47.840 --> 31:51.842
Tell Amy about the knocking
and banging on Karyll's door.

31:51.844 --> 31:56.914
It started off, she said, as almost like
a tapping, and then went to a knocking.

31:56.916 --> 31:58.515
And then to a banging noise.

31:58.517 --> 32:05.088
Mia has heard scratching on
her door and her doorknob moving.

32:05.090 --> 32:10.994
It's incredibly terrifying, because I could
hear my daughter's doorknob moving.

32:11.829 --> 32:15.365
And sometimes I'm so scared,
I can't get up and go check.

32:16.401 --> 32:18.368
[Steve] Is all of this coming
from these two dirtbags?

32:18.603 --> 32:19.436
No.

32:21.105 --> 32:23.540
It's mainly being caused
by the girls.

32:23.574 --> 32:25.175
Oh, God.

32:25.777 --> 32:31.648
They have abilities and so, there's a
lot of energy that's building with them.

32:31.650 --> 32:33.784
And so,
it's just kind of coming out.

32:33.786 --> 32:37.854
Lights going on and off,
banging, the tapping, all of that,

32:37.856 --> 32:42.292
uh, falls into poltergeist,
uh, phenomenon.

32:44.729 --> 32:47.564
<i>[Steve] What kind of abilities
are we talking about?</i>

32:47.566 --> 32:53.103
Mia, I believe her to be more
of a medium, physical medium.

32:54.672 --> 32:56.606
- A physical medium like yourself?
- [Amy] Yes.

32:56.608 --> 33:00.544
I think I felt like Karyll
was more empathic.

33:00.546 --> 33:04.414
Karyll's very surprising. I
would have not expected that.

33:04.416 --> 33:06.550
Um, we've always said her
like is rainbows and butterflies.

33:06.552 --> 33:08.518
Mia, I'm not surprised.

33:08.520 --> 33:12.723
Always felt, from the day she was born,
that there was something special about her.

33:12.725 --> 33:16.026
So, when you hear about the
poltergeist stuff, does that scare you?

33:16.028 --> 33:21.431
It's concerning, but I'm far more
concerned about the two guys.

33:22.934 --> 33:23.834
- [Amy] Yeah.
- Any sense of who

33:23.901 --> 33:24.801
they might have been
when they were alive?

33:24.803 --> 33:27.037
What I got
was that they were criminals.

33:27.039 --> 33:29.639
That they were alive
pretty recently.

33:29.641 --> 33:32.576
No further back than the 1990s.

33:32.578 --> 33:37.814
One is a pretty big dude,
very built.

33:37.816 --> 33:44.654
The other one, um, is smaller, like,
thinner and I would have put him in his 20s.

33:44.656 --> 33:45.588
I wasn't sure.

33:45.590 --> 33:48.492
Like, I was like,
"Did they actually, like,

33:48.494 --> 33:52.529
escape jail? Were they ever in jail?
Did they die before they went to jail?"

33:52.531 --> 33:56.733
But, in their death,
they feel, like, free.

33:56.735 --> 33:59.870
In my investigation, I came
across someone who killed himself,

33:59.872 --> 34:01.705
but he did it to escape
from going to jail.

34:01.739 --> 34:03.874
His name was Curtis Dixon.

34:03.876 --> 34:08.445
And in 2004, he was a 21-year-old
student in UNC Wilmington.

34:08.447 --> 34:10.447
I got his mug shot right here.

34:10.449 --> 34:13.784
Now, he lived in a dorm
about 3,000 feet from here.

34:13.786 --> 34:18.021
He became obsessed with
another student in the same dorm,

34:18.023 --> 34:20.624
an 18-year-old girl
named Jessica Faulkner.

34:20.691 --> 34:21.958
I got her photo.

34:24.362 --> 34:27.464
He took the same classes as
her, he kept making moves on her,

34:27.466 --> 34:28.832
but she wanted nothing
to do with him.

34:28.834 --> 34:33.737
So, now, on May fourth, 2004,
Curtis lured her to the room

34:33.739 --> 34:35.572
by saying he had
a present for her.

34:35.574 --> 34:36.907
So, now, once she's in the room,

34:36.909 --> 34:38.608
when she got there,
he did the old,

34:38.610 --> 34:40.811
"Oh, turn around,
I want to surprise you."

34:40.813 --> 34:45.949
He strangles her, he rapes
her, ties her to the bed.

34:46.584 --> 34:49.186
The next morning,
he gets up and she's dead.

34:49.821 --> 34:51.621
I get disgusted just talking
about this guy.

34:51.623 --> 34:53.957
Uh, so the prosecution
threw the book at him

34:53.959 --> 34:57.594
and he was facing the death
penalty, basically, in North Carolina.

34:57.596 --> 34:58.728
While he was in prison,
after his arrest,

34:58.730 --> 35:01.231
he broke free
from one of the guards.

35:01.233 --> 35:04.935
He ran up three flights of stairs,
he took a head dive over the top

35:04.937 --> 35:07.437
and landed on his head
and broke his neck and died.

35:07.439 --> 35:10.040
- What the [bleep]?
- [Steve] Yeah.

35:10.042 --> 35:13.310
Is it possible he's one of the
criminals you saw that's here?

35:13.511 --> 35:14.878
Yes.

35:15.880 --> 35:18.615
[Steve] Okay, so at least we know
who one of these shadow guys are.

35:18.617 --> 35:20.984
Do they do anything else
to these guys?

35:20.986 --> 35:24.654
<i>[Amy] I saw him in the back
bedroom, a girl in there crying.</i>

35:24.656 --> 35:25.989
- That's Karyll's room.
- Mm-hmm.

35:25.991 --> 35:30.660
[Amy] He appears as, you know,
8-feet tall, black mask.

35:30.662 --> 35:33.997
She heard a noise
outside her bedroom door

35:33.999 --> 35:38.101
and then, all of a sudden, it
came into the crack of the door.

35:38.103 --> 35:40.403
And was, literally,
staring at her.

35:40.838 --> 35:42.739
[Amy] That's not good.

35:42.741 --> 35:44.908
What I was seeing was
him attacking her physically,

35:44.910 --> 35:46.810
uh, holding her down
by her wrists

35:46.812 --> 35:49.713
and was doing something
to her right leg.

35:49.715 --> 35:52.582
Is it possible she doesn't
remember in the morning?

35:52.584 --> 35:56.620
Or, just too scared to say? Because,
I mean, she's never told me that.

35:56.622 --> 35:58.889
But, she has had bruises on her leg
and I'll be like, "Oh, what happened?"

35:58.891 --> 35:59.856
And she'll be like,
"I don't know."

36:00.324 --> 36:03.326
And she's complained
about pain in her legs.

36:03.328 --> 36:06.763
[Amy] It's possible she can't
remember the attacks. Yeah.

36:06.765 --> 36:10.867
Now, is Karyll's room the only
room where they're attacking people?

36:10.869 --> 36:14.404
[Amy] No. I saw one of
them in the lime-green room.

36:14.406 --> 36:16.339
<i>[Steve] So, that's Mia's room.</i>

36:16.341 --> 36:20.844
His attitude was even more intense
than the other guy in the other room.

36:20.846 --> 36:23.413
I heard him yelling
at the person.

36:23.415 --> 36:27.284
And I saw him
actually jumping this person.

36:28.219 --> 36:34.090
<i>We're making this person
do or say or act abnormally.</i>

36:34.092 --> 36:38.128
<i>Uh, so, it's harming them more
mentally and psychologically.</i>

36:38.429 --> 36:40.430
Why? She's 10 years old.

36:40.432 --> 36:42.232
He wants to torture her.

36:43.634 --> 36:44.901
- That pisses me off.
- [Sarah] Yeah.

36:44.903 --> 36:47.871
[Steve] Tell Amy about her mood
swings and how she gets angry.

36:47.873 --> 36:52.642
So, she too, will get
extremely angry

36:52.644 --> 36:53.710
and kind of fly off the handle.

36:53.712 --> 36:55.912
And it's so out of character
for her.

36:55.914 --> 36:58.815
We had an idea that
something bigger was going on.

36:58.817 --> 37:02.185
We knew that it wasn't just her.

37:02.187 --> 37:06.022
Is that possible, that she's being
jumped and that's what's coming out?

37:06.157 --> 37:07.724
Yeah.

37:08.192 --> 37:12.862
[Steve] So, Amy, Mia's seen a shadow
figure too. And she did a drawing of it.

37:12.864 --> 37:16.099
Anything familiar about this
sketch from what you saw?

37:16.968 --> 37:19.102
Well, I had a sketch done
of, of what I saw.

37:29.981 --> 37:31.047
Hmm.

37:35.853 --> 37:37.020
[Sarah exhales]

37:38.089 --> 37:40.056
That's exactly how she sleeps.

37:41.492 --> 37:42.025
It's very scary.

37:42.027 --> 37:45.262
It's very, very scary.

37:46.197 --> 37:47.998
No kid should deal
with any of it.

37:48.032 --> 37:49.399
It's disgusting.

37:49.401 --> 37:50.967
I mean, I'm ready
to get rid of him.

37:50.969 --> 37:52.168
I want to hurt him.

37:52.737 --> 37:54.204
Nobody messes with my kids.

38:10.921 --> 38:13.123
So, Jon, Sarah, you guys thought

38:13.125 --> 38:16.293
something paranormal in the
house was going after your children.

38:16.694 --> 38:17.794
And you were right.

38:17.796 --> 38:19.963
But now, we gotta answer
the big question.

38:20.498 --> 38:22.832
Is there something you can do,

38:22.834 --> 38:25.635
so you can get back to
being a healthy, happy family?

38:25.637 --> 38:28.305
Or, you have to get
the hell out of here.

38:28.307 --> 38:30.340
Um, for that answer,
I'm gonna turn it over to Amy.

38:32.677 --> 38:36.846
First thing, uh, that needs to
be taken care of is the men.

38:36.848 --> 38:42.786
So, you can find
any type of witch.

38:42.788 --> 38:45.889
And the first thing
that they need to do

38:45.891 --> 38:49.626
is to cleanse the home
and the yard.

38:49.628 --> 38:51.895
Now, once that's done,

38:51.897 --> 38:57.367
the witch will then put
a barrier up in the yard.

38:57.369 --> 39:01.604
Then the men will
lose interest and leave.

39:01.606 --> 39:08.278
When this person is doing all of
these steps, someone needs to be there

39:08.280 --> 39:12.015
following them and learning
every single thing they're doing.

39:12.017 --> 39:18.388
Because, this will need to be
repeated at least once a month,

39:18.390 --> 39:21.658
while you guys
are still in this home.

39:21.660 --> 39:24.661
[Steve] Will things get better once
these shadow guys are out of the house?

39:24.663 --> 39:29.599
Yes. I believe
that Mia won't be,

39:29.601 --> 39:33.937
uh, as aggressive in her
behaviors as she is being now.

39:33.939 --> 39:38.775
They won't see, uh,
the shadow guys anymore.

39:38.777 --> 39:41.044
Is any of this cleansing stuff
gonna help...

39:41.046 --> 39:43.279
Uh, and the barrier,
help this impending doom

39:43.281 --> 39:45.148
that you're feeling
in the neighborhood?

39:45.182 --> 39:46.649
Yeah.

39:46.717 --> 39:53.323
The consistent cleansing is going to
help to, uh, get that out of your space.

39:53.325 --> 39:58.628
As far as the poltergeist phenomenon
is concerned, regarding Mia,

39:58.630 --> 40:05.602
she should, uh, take some type of
creative writing workshop or class.

40:05.604 --> 40:09.839
It will help her focus and
process and disperse her energy.

40:09.841 --> 40:14.644
Then, it's okay for her to
begin to dig into her ability

40:14.646 --> 40:20.550
and really figure out
what she wants to do.

40:20.552 --> 40:26.089
As for Karyll, right now, I would
suggest learning about crystal protection.

40:26.091 --> 40:30.193
Uh, learning about various,
uh, types of herbs and oils

40:30.195 --> 40:32.429
that she can use
to protect herself.

40:33.631 --> 40:34.330
This is all doable.

40:34.332 --> 40:36.132
- [Sarah] Absolutely.
- Yeah.

40:36.134 --> 40:37.033
You guys feel good about it?

40:37.035 --> 40:38.301
Yes.

40:38.769 --> 40:40.069
- We have answers.
- [Sarah] Yeah.

40:40.071 --> 40:42.238
It's a weight off of our
shoulders, I feel like.

40:42.240 --> 40:43.773
- We have a plan.
- [Sarah] Yeah.

40:43.775 --> 40:46.242
Which is more than
we've had in a long time.

40:46.944 --> 40:49.712
I'm gonna ask you two the
same question I ask everybody,

40:49.714 --> 40:51.080
are you gonna take Amy's advice?

40:51.415 --> 40:53.249
- Absolutely.
- [Jon] Yup.

40:54.852 --> 40:56.986
- He's gotta go.
- [Steve] Yeah.

40:57.087 --> 40:59.923
I have no patience for bullies.

40:59.925 --> 41:04.360
I mean, knowing that we can protect our
kids and they can actually sleep at night

41:04.362 --> 41:08.431
and won't be living
day-to-day scared.

41:08.433 --> 41:12.101
There's no words for it. I mean, I
think that we're incredibly thankful.

41:12.103 --> 41:14.804
Thank you guys so much.

41:14.806 --> 41:17.607
<i>[Amy] I really hope Jonathan and Sarah
follow my advice and work with a witch</i>

41:17.609 --> 41:23.012
<i>to remove the dead men and
cleanse their house of negative energy.</i>

41:23.014 --> 41:26.983
If they do that, and help their daughters
learn how to control their abilities,

41:26.985 --> 41:31.955
I believe this family can live peacefully
in their home for many years to come.

41:38.929 --> 41:41.965
Thank you, Steve and Amy,
for coming out.

41:41.967 --> 41:44.434
After the reveal,
Jon and I found

41:44.436 --> 41:48.004
the witch that Amy
had recommended.

41:48.006 --> 41:52.108
<i>[Jon] Since then, the activity in
the house has pretty much vanished.</i>

41:52.110 --> 41:55.011
<i>[Sarah] Everybody in the home
seems to be at peace.</i>

41:55.013 --> 41:59.249
And we're happy with
everything that is going on now.
