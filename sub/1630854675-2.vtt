WEBVTT

00:05.266 --> 00:08.095
What will you call that blue?
Cerulean?

00:08.269 --> 00:11.054
- I guess.
- No, no, azure.

00:11.228 --> 00:12.316
Yeah, sure.

00:15.667 --> 00:16.886
I don't want to
be one of those people

00:17.060 --> 00:20.759
who go around telling other
people to smile and cheer up.

00:20.933 --> 00:22.935
But I should smile
and cheer up.

00:23.110 --> 00:26.417
Yeah, well, maybe. Yes.
For the guests.

00:26.591 --> 00:28.724
I know.
It's just...

00:28.898 --> 00:31.422
I really miss Gina.

00:31.596 --> 00:34.382
Hmm, well,

00:34.556 --> 00:36.645
that's another shade of blue.

00:36.819 --> 00:38.168
Yeah.

00:39.996 --> 00:41.737
Come over tonight.

00:41.911 --> 00:43.739
We'll have a breakup
movie marathon.

00:46.220 --> 00:48.613
It's okay.
I'm just not really feeling it.

00:48.787 --> 00:50.398
Okay.

00:50.572 --> 00:52.400
I'll even do a face mask.

00:54.184 --> 00:56.360
No, it's really... It's okay.

00:56.534 --> 00:59.798
Besides, I don't want to
bring down this whole giddy

00:59.972 --> 01:02.845
and in love but finally
not afraid to show it vibe.

01:03.019 --> 01:05.413
- I'm not giddy, thank you.
- Uh-huh.

01:05.587 --> 01:08.459
- Let's go.
- Morning, Elena.

01:08.633 --> 01:09.721
Javier.

01:09.895 --> 01:11.462
- Uh-huh, not giddy.
- No.

01:11.636 --> 01:13.595
Yes, made it to paradise.

01:13.769 --> 01:14.944
Which way to
the infinity pool?

01:15.118 --> 01:17.164
Eh, first the bar,
then the infinity pool.

01:17.338 --> 01:19.383
- Ah.
- Meet Mateo, Shawn, and Eli.

01:19.557 --> 01:21.951
Hello, gentlemen.
I'm Elena Roarke, your host.

01:22.125 --> 01:23.953
This is my associate, Ruby.
- Hi.

01:24.127 --> 01:26.086
And I see that
your bachelor party weekend

01:26.260 --> 01:28.653
has already started.

01:28.827 --> 01:30.046
Oh, yeah.

01:30.220 --> 01:32.048
So which one of you
is getting married?

01:32.222 --> 01:34.268
Oh, that'd be me.
At least that's the plan.

01:34.442 --> 01:36.748
These drunk guys are
my best man and groomsman.

01:38.446 --> 01:39.447
Well, we are delighted
to meet you all.

01:39.621 --> 01:42.363
Ash will get you settled,
and then we'll talk.

01:42.537 --> 01:44.060
Welcome to Fantasy Island.
- Thank you.

01:44.234 --> 01:45.366
Right this way.

01:49.152 --> 01:52.112
So what's the plan for the big
bachelor party blowout?

01:52.286 --> 01:54.897
Casino night
or beer pong Olympics?

01:55.071 --> 01:57.160
Well, they each
get their own fantasy.

01:57.334 --> 01:59.293
Isn't that enough?

02:00.511 --> 02:02.905
Um, we're supposed
to have another guest.

02:03.079 --> 02:04.298
Where's Ms. Reyes?

02:06.778 --> 02:07.562
both: Hmm.

02:12.088 --> 02:13.089
Ms. Reyes?

02:15.657 --> 02:16.962
Hello.

02:17.137 --> 02:19.095
I'm Elena Roarke.
I'm your host.

02:21.402 --> 02:22.968
Are the bros gone?

02:23.143 --> 02:26.407
Mm, well,
welcome to Fantasy Island.

02:40.725 --> 02:43.075
Helene Reyes,
this is my associate Ruby.

02:43.250 --> 02:45.469
- Hi.
- Hey.

02:46.514 --> 02:48.342
Only child of a single mom.

02:48.516 --> 02:50.605
Carrying my own bag since
I was five.

02:50.779 --> 02:52.868
By all means.

02:53.042 --> 02:55.262
So I thought this place
was supposed to be special.

02:55.436 --> 02:56.959
What's up with the dude squad?

02:57.133 --> 02:59.657
Wonderful to meet you too.

02:59.831 --> 03:02.921
I promise you,
the dudes are here for a reason

03:03.095 --> 03:04.749
just like everyone else
who comes to Fantasy Island.

03:04.923 --> 03:06.882
Now, we're gonna go to
my office so we can talk about

03:07.056 --> 03:08.971
why you're here.

03:09.145 --> 03:10.538
After you, please.

03:13.497 --> 03:17.327
Uh... please meet me
in my office in an hour.

03:17.501 --> 03:18.850
We need to
go over the schedule.

03:19.024 --> 03:20.200
Of course.
See you then.

03:23.028 --> 03:26.684
Now, I know you don't
need to go over the schedule.

03:28.425 --> 03:30.993
I was conceived
in the middle of a hurricane.

03:31.167 --> 03:32.429
Hurricane Helene.

03:32.603 --> 03:35.432
Wow, well, that's one way
to weather a storm.

03:35.606 --> 03:36.868
It was in the jungle
in Belize.

03:37.042 --> 03:39.044
My mom thought
she was gonna die that night.

03:39.219 --> 03:41.133
Instead, here I am.

03:41.308 --> 03:42.874
At least that's the story.

03:43.048 --> 03:46.748
- You were meant to be.
- I guess.

03:46.922 --> 03:48.793
You know, it's always
just been the two of us.

03:48.967 --> 03:50.360
Sometimes my friends
would think

03:50.534 --> 03:52.493
that it was sad, but it wasn't.

03:52.667 --> 03:54.582
Well, a family
can look like anything.

03:54.756 --> 03:56.584
It's love that matters.

03:56.758 --> 03:58.542
We would have
pancakes for dinner

03:58.716 --> 04:00.631
and go camping for Christmas.

04:00.805 --> 04:02.198
And then when I was sick,

04:02.372 --> 04:04.461
she would make this big nest
in the middle of her bed

04:04.635 --> 04:05.984
and rub my back
until I fell asleep.

04:06.158 --> 04:07.812
It was pretty perfect.

04:07.986 --> 04:09.858
She sounds wonderful.

04:10.032 --> 04:11.294
She was.

04:12.904 --> 04:15.951
She, uh, she died a year ago.
- Oh.

04:16.125 --> 04:17.909
I am so sorry for your loss.

04:21.086 --> 04:23.045
I've been sleeping with this
under my pillow.

04:25.439 --> 04:28.529
Which I know is stupid,
but whatever.

04:28.703 --> 04:31.793
I don't think
that's stupid at all.

04:31.967 --> 04:34.274
So Helene,
what can the Island do for you?

04:37.189 --> 04:40.410
My fantasy is to find him.

04:40.584 --> 04:44.458
- Your father?
- My biological father.

04:44.632 --> 04:47.722
You know, with my mom gone,
I just feel kind of untethered.

04:47.896 --> 04:50.115
I want to be
connected to something

04:50.290 --> 04:52.596
and, like, what if
I need a kidney?

04:52.770 --> 04:54.555
What do you know about him?

04:54.729 --> 04:56.513
Just that my mom
called him Sunshine,

04:56.687 --> 04:58.602
'cause he was a ray of light
in the hurricane,

04:58.776 --> 05:01.170
and he called her Blue
'cause of her eyes.

05:01.344 --> 05:03.564
But they only spent
that one night together.

05:03.738 --> 05:05.870
Romantic.

05:06.044 --> 05:10.092
Also, apparently he has
a really great smile.

05:10.266 --> 05:12.703
My mom said
I got mine from him.

05:12.877 --> 05:14.923
Well, let's hope the Island
gives you a reason to use it.

05:15.097 --> 05:17.360
- Mm-hmm.
- Come with me.

05:22.496 --> 05:24.280
So what happens now?

05:24.454 --> 05:26.021
What do I do?
- Choose a path.

05:26.195 --> 05:27.283
That's it?

05:27.457 --> 05:28.980
Every fantasy's different, Helene.

05:29.154 --> 05:31.766
Sometimes I have a map
or itinerary.

05:31.940 --> 05:36.640
In your case,
just do what feels right.

05:36.814 --> 05:40.514
Is it possible...
no, I mean there's no way.

05:40.688 --> 05:43.343
My bio dad's not one
of the guys from the plane.

05:43.517 --> 05:45.388
Is he?
- I don't know.

05:45.562 --> 05:46.911
But it is meaningful

05:47.085 --> 05:49.044
that you're all here together,
for what it's worth.

06:01.535 --> 06:02.666
<i>Oh, I know.</i>

06:02.840 --> 06:04.407
<i>What about some yoga
to perk you up?</i>

06:04.581 --> 06:07.584
I'm not really feeling
all bendy, so...

06:07.758 --> 06:10.631
Okay, origami lesson.
Bike ride.

06:11.936 --> 06:13.068
You know what?

06:13.242 --> 06:15.679
I'll plan
Mateo's bachelor party.

06:15.853 --> 06:17.159
That seems like
the opposite of what's gonna

06:17.333 --> 06:19.248
make you feel better
after a breakup.

06:19.422 --> 06:21.946
Well, maybe basking
in somebody's joy

06:22.120 --> 06:24.209
will be good for me.

06:24.384 --> 06:26.777
Okay, but no strippers.

06:26.951 --> 06:28.649
So how does this work?

06:28.823 --> 06:30.738
Do we just, like, blurt out
our fantasies or...

06:30.912 --> 06:32.522
Well, assuming
you're all okay

06:32.696 --> 06:35.133
with your friends hearing
your heart's desires.

06:35.307 --> 06:37.005
Oh, unlike most guys,
we tell each other everything.

06:37.179 --> 06:39.616
Great.
Let's start with you, Shawn.

06:39.790 --> 06:41.183
What can the Island do for you?

06:41.357 --> 06:44.404
- I'm a scaredy-cat.
- Oh, me too.

06:44.578 --> 06:47.058
Also, I'm queer.

06:47.232 --> 06:48.756
Oh, me too!

06:48.930 --> 06:50.801
Hey.

06:50.975 --> 06:54.239
Yeah, coming out in college
was a whole deal,

06:54.414 --> 06:56.764
but luckily these guys
supported me.

06:56.938 --> 06:58.722
- We're not complete jerks.
- Mm.

06:58.896 --> 07:03.248
It felt so good.
Just completely empowering.

07:03.423 --> 07:06.513
But it's like I used up
all my cards in that one act,

07:06.687 --> 07:10.255
and everything else
just still terrifies me.

07:10.430 --> 07:12.954
He has four smoke alarms
in a one-bedroom apartment.

07:13.128 --> 07:16.871
My fantasy is
to be free of fear.

07:17.045 --> 07:19.613
All fear?
I'm not sure that's wise.

07:19.787 --> 07:21.223
Just for a couple days.

07:21.397 --> 07:23.530
I just want to see what it's
like to do whatever I want

07:23.704 --> 07:26.271
without being gripped
by utter terror.

07:26.446 --> 07:28.186
What is it
that you want to do?

07:28.360 --> 07:31.015
Scuba dive, eat weird stuff,

07:31.189 --> 07:34.410
get a tattoo, touch a spider,
just everything.

07:34.584 --> 07:36.412
Okay, well, we can manage
that and maybe a little more.

07:36.586 --> 07:38.370
Mm.

07:38.545 --> 07:41.069
Eli, what about you?

07:41.243 --> 07:43.680
My fantasy
is to be a chick magnet.

07:43.854 --> 07:45.943
Oh.

07:46.117 --> 07:48.729
- You think I'm an ass?
- We don't judge.

07:48.903 --> 07:51.340
I've always been
romantically challenged.

07:51.514 --> 07:53.298
The third wheel,
the funny friend,

07:53.473 --> 07:55.344
the shoulder girls cry on
when they get dumped.

07:55.518 --> 07:57.868
It gets old.
- It's not like you're an ogre.

07:58.042 --> 07:59.653
Yeah and your last
girlfriend was gorgeous

07:59.827 --> 08:01.263
and crazy about you.
- Evelyn.

08:01.437 --> 08:03.483
He unceremoniously dumped her
on Valentine's Day.

08:03.657 --> 08:05.920
She wasn't the one.

08:06.094 --> 08:08.792
Okay, the point is
I've always had to work

08:08.966 --> 08:10.838
for whatever
female attention I get.

08:11.012 --> 08:13.057
For once, I'd like the women
to come to me.

08:13.231 --> 08:14.711
I understand.

08:14.885 --> 08:16.887
I'm sorry, but come on.

08:17.061 --> 08:19.324
I doubt that.

08:19.499 --> 08:20.978
What about
our groom's fantasy?

08:21.152 --> 08:23.067
Tell me.

08:23.241 --> 08:26.636
Have you ever met someone
and just clicked instantly?

08:26.810 --> 08:28.943
Aw, like you
and your fiancée.

08:29.117 --> 08:30.553
He's not talking
about Sophie.

08:30.727 --> 08:33.338
Although I do love Sophie
more than words can say.

08:33.513 --> 08:35.079
I mean, she's the woman
of my dreams.

08:35.253 --> 08:38.300
Uh, except for
the other woman of his dreams.

08:38.474 --> 08:42.826
Years ago, I spent one night
with a woman I met traveling.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.394
We were together
for less than 24 hours,

08:45.568 --> 08:47.135
but I haven't been able
to stop thinking about her.

08:47.309 --> 08:49.790
And I've always wondered...
- What if?

08:49.964 --> 08:53.750
My fantasy is to see her
one last time.

08:53.924 --> 08:58.102
Eli, there is a beautiful
young woman in a yellow bikini,

08:58.276 --> 09:00.844
and she is desperately trying
to get your attention.

09:05.196 --> 09:06.850
It appears I have
somewhere else to be.

09:09.766 --> 09:11.638
If you'll excuse me.
- Okay.

09:11.812 --> 09:13.553
Oh, my...

09:13.727 --> 09:17.252
Mateo, you and I,
we are headed this way.

09:17.426 --> 09:21.343
And I know
a great tattoo place.

09:21.517 --> 09:23.475
Oh, look at that.
No fear.

09:23.650 --> 09:25.434
- Ah!
- Let's go.

09:25.608 --> 09:28.089
Oh, and the bigger the better.
- Okay.

09:33.224 --> 09:35.400
As soon as you step
through that door,

09:35.575 --> 09:36.793
your fantasy will begin.

09:39.361 --> 09:40.928
She's on the other side?

09:42.364 --> 09:43.931
Maybe this is a bad idea.

09:44.105 --> 09:45.802
Only you know
the answer to that.

09:49.676 --> 09:50.590
Whenever you're ready.

10:40.596 --> 10:42.032
Hola.

10:42.206 --> 10:45.340
- Huh, an American.
- Guilty.

10:45.514 --> 10:46.515
Mom?

10:52.260 --> 10:53.914
You know, when you said
go over the schedule,

10:54.088 --> 10:55.176
I didn't picture this.

10:55.350 --> 10:57.657
And to be clear,

10:57.831 --> 10:59.571
I also didn't picture
going over the schedule.

10:59.746 --> 11:02.705
Patience, Javi.

11:07.405 --> 11:09.930
What is this place?

11:10.104 --> 11:12.236
A little secret of mine. Vamos.

11:15.936 --> 11:19.330
Welcome to my beach getaway.
- It's beautiful.

11:19.504 --> 11:22.246
Ah, you know,
it's a perk of the job.

11:22.420 --> 11:24.161
It's been passed down
through the Roarke family

11:24.335 --> 11:27.687
for generations
like, you know, my hacienda.

11:29.558 --> 11:31.516
How have I never noticed
this place from the plane?

11:31.691 --> 11:34.432
It's Island Magic.

11:34.606 --> 11:35.651
You'll see it
now that you know it's here.

11:35.825 --> 11:37.653
- Mm.
- Mm-hmm.

11:41.439 --> 11:42.876
You know what?

11:43.050 --> 11:45.313
You are the first person
that I have ever brought here.

11:47.315 --> 11:48.882
- I'm honored.
- Mm.

11:49.056 --> 11:50.448
How many more secrets
do you have?

11:50.622 --> 11:52.102
Lots.

11:52.276 --> 11:54.235
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

11:54.409 --> 11:57.412
Well, I don't have any.
What you see is what you get.

11:57.586 --> 11:59.196
Well, it's a good thing
that I like what I see.

12:01.938 --> 12:04.593
Now, let's go over
that schedule.

12:04.767 --> 12:06.290
- Right now?
- Mm-hmm.

12:06.464 --> 12:08.336
Let's go.

12:10.120 --> 12:13.950
I am in the ocean.

12:14.124 --> 12:16.126
I'm not worried about
sharks or riptides.

12:16.300 --> 12:19.347
It's just water.

12:19.521 --> 12:21.175
This is amazing.

12:21.349 --> 12:22.959
Well, I mean,
I wouldn't say that you are

12:23.133 --> 12:27.485
technically in the ocean,
but yay.

12:27.659 --> 12:30.227
I wasted so much of
my life just thinking

12:30.401 --> 12:33.187
every little thing was the big,
bad monster under the bed.

12:33.361 --> 12:34.536
I only have two fears.

12:34.710 --> 12:36.799
Singing in public

12:36.973 --> 12:38.975
and being alone
for the rest of my life.

12:39.149 --> 12:40.977
One visceral,
one existential.

12:41.151 --> 12:43.545
Very respectable.

12:43.719 --> 12:44.851
Oh.

12:47.679 --> 12:50.073
It looks like Eli's having
the time of his life.

12:50.247 --> 12:51.727
Or he's trying to.

12:51.901 --> 12:54.121
See, the fantasies here

12:54.295 --> 12:56.079
can be a lot more layered
than they seem.

12:56.253 --> 12:59.082
But, have you decided on what
you're getting for your tattoo?

12:59.256 --> 13:00.910
No clue.

13:01.084 --> 13:03.043
How'd you decide on yours?

13:03.217 --> 13:05.393
Well, actually,
mine chose me.

13:05.567 --> 13:07.351
I got it at this little hut
that I'm taking you to.

13:07.525 --> 13:08.831
And had you
always wanted one?

13:09.005 --> 13:11.312
No. No, no, never.

13:11.486 --> 13:15.229
But there was this woman, Isla.
- Oh!

13:15.403 --> 13:18.232
And something called
Island Magic.

13:18.406 --> 13:21.322
And, well, the moment
was the moment.

13:21.496 --> 13:24.107
And this tattoo literally
became the dividing line

13:24.281 --> 13:28.372
between my old life
and my new one.

13:28.546 --> 13:30.897
I hope the same thing
is true for me.

13:31.071 --> 13:32.159
We're here.

13:33.813 --> 13:35.597
Okay.
- Yeah.

13:40.167 --> 13:42.517
Hey, there.
How can I help you?

13:42.691 --> 13:45.302
I want to get a tattoo.
A big one.

13:45.476 --> 13:48.915
Uh, you do realize
you can still feel pain, right?

13:49.089 --> 13:51.787
- Or, like, medium.
- Mm-hmm.

13:51.961 --> 13:53.441
Sure, man, I got you.

13:53.615 --> 13:55.660
Take a look.
See if something speaks to you.

13:55.835 --> 13:57.488
Okay.

13:57.662 --> 14:01.014
Um... I'm just wondering.
Is Isla working today?

14:01.188 --> 14:04.278
I don't know that name. Sorry.

14:04.452 --> 14:06.280
Isla.
She's got long, shiny hair.

14:06.454 --> 14:09.587
Brown eyes.
The sweet, soft, melodic voice.

14:09.761 --> 14:12.982
I've been here for years,
and there's no Isla.

14:13.156 --> 14:16.246
- Huh.
- How about this?

14:16.420 --> 14:18.858
Koi fish. Symbolizes courage.

14:19.032 --> 14:21.034
Perfect.
See? It chose you.

14:22.383 --> 14:25.603
Wise choice.
Take a seat, bro.

14:25.777 --> 14:28.041
Well, would you like me
to hold your hand through it?

14:28.215 --> 14:29.520
- I got this.
- Yeah?

14:29.694 --> 14:31.522
Yeah.
I'm fearless.

14:31.696 --> 14:32.872
Okay.

14:38.486 --> 14:40.096
That door
was supposed to be locked.

14:40.270 --> 14:41.619
We're closed for siesta.

14:41.793 --> 14:43.578
I've been on the road
for 39 hours.

14:43.752 --> 14:46.015
Take pity on me?
- Come back in an hour.

14:46.189 --> 14:48.539
Please,
just a bowl of paella?

14:48.713 --> 14:51.151
I happen to know that
you have a pot on the stove.

14:51.325 --> 14:53.109
Well, you're very
sure of yourself.

14:53.283 --> 14:56.069
I'm just really,
really hungry.

14:56.243 --> 14:58.549
Also...

14:58.723 --> 15:01.291
you might be the most beautiful
woman I've ever seen.

15:03.293 --> 15:05.513
And you're lucky
you have a nice smile.

15:08.298 --> 15:08.995
I'll get the paella.

15:21.311 --> 15:24.053
Hello, Helene.
Have a seat.

15:26.099 --> 15:28.884
Horchata.
Very popular here in Spain.

15:29.058 --> 15:30.320
She's not my mom.

15:30.494 --> 15:33.367
I know.
Her name is Camilla.

15:33.541 --> 15:36.239
She and Mateo spent a night
together in Barcelona in 2001.

15:38.589 --> 15:39.590
So that means
he's not my father.

15:39.764 --> 15:41.331
Oh, we don't know that
for sure.

15:41.505 --> 15:44.378
This is a snapshot.
It's not his whole life.

15:44.552 --> 15:46.162
What if my father
doesn't even remember my mom?

15:46.336 --> 15:47.772
Your mother doesn't sound

15:47.947 --> 15:50.253
like a woman
who'd be easily forgotten.

15:50.427 --> 15:51.776
And you know, people can make

15:51.951 --> 15:54.040
a big impact on us
in a very short time.

15:54.214 --> 15:56.216
Look at Mateo and Camilla.

15:56.390 --> 16:00.394
Their time together has
stayed with him all this time.

16:00.568 --> 16:02.439
I just hope
she meant something to him.

16:02.613 --> 16:04.964
My mom deserves that.

16:05.138 --> 16:07.836
You know,
I've never seen one guest

16:08.010 --> 16:10.621
follow another
into their fantasy.

16:10.795 --> 16:13.363
- Is it against the rules?
- There are no rules,

16:13.537 --> 16:17.759
but it says something
about you.

16:17.933 --> 16:19.674
What does it say?

16:19.848 --> 16:21.415
I'm not sure yet.

16:21.589 --> 16:24.026
For now, we know
that you're a young woman

16:24.200 --> 16:27.203
in a beautiful city
on a beautiful day.

16:27.377 --> 16:29.858
Maybe you'd like
to have a little fun.

16:30.032 --> 16:32.382
I'm not here to have fun.
No, I'm here to find my father.

16:32.556 --> 16:35.385
A fantasy is a journey.

16:35.559 --> 16:37.866
One that will take you
to unexpected places

16:38.040 --> 16:41.609
where you'll learn
unexpected things.

16:41.783 --> 16:43.785
So come on. Sit.

16:55.318 --> 16:56.493
Ms. Roarke?

16:58.191 --> 16:59.105
Ms. Roarke?

17:04.980 --> 17:06.808
Ms. Roarke?

17:06.982 --> 17:08.679
Ms. Roarke?

17:08.853 --> 17:10.333
Great.

17:23.955 --> 17:25.174
Now what?

17:33.226 --> 17:35.837
Who the hell are you?

17:36.011 --> 17:38.144
Hey, I'm Shawn.

17:38.318 --> 17:39.884
Are you the girl
from the plane?

17:40.059 --> 17:40.929
I'm Helene.

17:44.759 --> 17:48.676
This is gonna sound crazy,
but I think I'm your daughter.

17:48.850 --> 17:50.808
Uh...

17:50.982 --> 17:54.247
When I say balloons,
I mean balloons, okay?

17:54.421 --> 17:56.553
Y'all can't show up
with six little balloons

17:56.727 --> 17:58.860
and expect me to be impressed.
Okay?

17:59.034 --> 18:00.340
- Yes, ma'am.
- Okay.

18:00.514 --> 18:03.952
You do realize this
is a party for three people.

18:04.126 --> 18:05.823
Well, actually, not anymore.

18:05.997 --> 18:08.130
The guys have
completely opened it up.

18:08.304 --> 18:10.698
Yeah, invited everyone.
Javier's coming.

18:10.872 --> 18:13.004
Shoot, all the guys
on the Island are coming.

18:13.179 --> 18:14.136
- Wow. Okay.
- Yeah.

18:14.310 --> 18:15.572
- Fun.
- Yeah.

18:17.661 --> 18:19.315
You seem better.

18:19.489 --> 18:22.275
Oh, well, you know,
I like a project.

18:25.016 --> 18:28.150
Elena, I don't know.

18:28.324 --> 18:30.413
What if there's
something wrong with me?

18:30.587 --> 18:33.112
- Why?
- Gina, she's just...

18:33.286 --> 18:37.420
wonderful.
She's beautiful, smart, funny.

18:37.594 --> 18:39.944
Why wasn't she enough for me?

18:40.119 --> 18:43.948
She can be wonderful
and not the one.

18:44.123 --> 18:46.125
So comfortable with us.

18:46.299 --> 18:48.823
Like slipping into
an old sweater.

18:48.997 --> 18:53.044
With Javier,
it's like walking on hot coals.

18:53.219 --> 18:55.569
Wow.

18:55.743 --> 18:56.439
Okay.

18:58.833 --> 19:01.662
But seriously, what if
I'm just going to be alone

19:01.836 --> 19:04.839
for the rest of
my now very long life?

19:05.013 --> 19:07.058
You know what
I think you need?

19:07.233 --> 19:09.104
- Hmm?
- Closure.

19:09.278 --> 19:11.106
When I had to end things
with James,

19:11.280 --> 19:14.196
I gathered everything
that reminded me of him.

19:14.370 --> 19:16.459
Then I had a ceremony
and I released it.

19:16.633 --> 19:18.200
Maybe you should
do the same thing.

19:18.374 --> 19:21.551
I don't know.
Sounds a little woo woo-y.

19:21.725 --> 19:23.771
Well, we do live
on a magical island.

19:26.165 --> 19:28.036
It can't hurt.

19:28.210 --> 19:29.298
And it might help.

19:35.870 --> 19:38.002
Okay, so you're absolutely
sure you did not have sex

19:38.177 --> 19:39.613
with a blue-eyed woman
in Belize

19:39.787 --> 19:41.005
in the middle of a hurricane?
- I'm sure.

19:41.180 --> 19:42.964
Can you just give me
a percentage?

19:43.138 --> 19:44.574
'Cause despite
this whole bro vibe,

19:44.748 --> 19:46.576
you seem like
solid dad material.

19:46.750 --> 19:49.840
100%. I only had sex
with a woman once.

19:50.014 --> 19:53.627
Bethany Willen.
Michigan, brown eyes, snowing.

19:53.801 --> 19:55.019
And I only did it to confirm

19:55.194 --> 19:57.239
I don't want to have sex
with a woman twice.

19:57.413 --> 19:59.067
Oh, look, it's a giant spider.

20:00.764 --> 20:03.898
- She's cute.
- Well, she's large.

20:05.421 --> 20:09.164
You okay?
- Yeah.

20:09.338 --> 20:11.601
No.

20:11.775 --> 20:13.386
What am I doing here?

20:13.560 --> 20:15.649
I'm supposed to be finding
my bio father-person.

20:15.823 --> 20:18.434
Where is he?

20:18.608 --> 20:20.219
I wish I could
answer that for you.

20:20.393 --> 20:21.263
Me too.

20:24.571 --> 20:27.095
You just planning
to stare at that?

20:29.489 --> 20:33.144
All right.

20:34.755 --> 20:36.104
She's so soft.

20:36.278 --> 20:38.889
And I'm not scared of you. Nope.

20:39.063 --> 20:40.891
This is seriously
why you're here--

20:41.065 --> 20:43.764
scuba diving and spiders?

20:43.938 --> 20:45.287
The last time I was
this close to an arachnid,

20:45.461 --> 20:46.854
I literally had to call Eli

20:47.028 --> 20:48.551
while I was standing on
the lid of my toilet,

20:48.725 --> 20:51.250
and he had to come rescue me
from my own bathroom.

20:51.424 --> 20:53.861
Look, I, um...
I know I'm new here,

20:54.035 --> 20:56.646
but this is Fantasy Island.

20:56.820 --> 20:59.736
There has to be something
bigger that you're afraid of.

20:59.910 --> 21:02.435
And I'm not judging.
- You're totally judging.

21:02.609 --> 21:04.611
Okay, yeah, I'm judging.

21:04.785 --> 21:07.657
I am walking around
asking random men

21:07.831 --> 21:09.355
if they are my father.

21:09.529 --> 21:13.228
Sometimes you have to jump off
the toilet lid and deal.

21:16.449 --> 21:18.102
You're smart
for a Gen Z brat.

21:18.277 --> 21:20.409
Maybe I'm just here
to drop some Gen Z wisdom

21:20.583 --> 21:22.063
on your scaredy-cat
millennial butt.

21:22.237 --> 21:23.673
Oh!

21:26.850 --> 21:29.462
Or...

21:29.636 --> 21:31.638
maybe he's your guy.

21:33.422 --> 21:36.077
Oh, here on my nose.

21:36.251 --> 21:37.948
I reject that.

21:38.122 --> 21:39.863
If solid dad material
is what you're looking for,

21:40.037 --> 21:41.604
Eli fits the bill.

21:41.778 --> 21:44.912
All current evidence
to the contrary.

21:45.086 --> 21:46.261
Look, I'm serious.

21:46.435 --> 21:48.307
I've known the guy eight years,

21:48.481 --> 21:49.873
and he's never
forgotten my birthday.

21:50.047 --> 21:52.441
Mateo
hasn't remembered it once.

21:54.138 --> 21:56.663
He's just so... yucky.

21:56.837 --> 21:59.230
He's--
he's working something out.

21:59.405 --> 22:01.711
I'm not sure what.

22:01.885 --> 22:05.454
But for real, he's a good guy.

22:12.809 --> 22:15.508
Believe it or not, I remember
this like it was yesterday.

22:15.682 --> 22:17.727
Walking here with you.

22:17.901 --> 22:19.947
Perhaps we knew each other
in another life.

22:20.121 --> 22:23.385
In that other life,
I bought you a red rose.

22:28.608 --> 22:32.002
And you kissed me.
Right here.

22:35.963 --> 22:37.617
And then what?

22:37.791 --> 22:40.271
Then I worked up my nerve

22:40.446 --> 22:44.493
and I took your hand like this.

22:44.667 --> 22:47.235
I like this other life.
It's very romantic.

22:47.409 --> 22:49.106
It was a beautiful life.

22:49.280 --> 22:52.762
Well, 24 hours.
We had one day.

22:52.936 --> 22:54.285
I hope we made
the most of it.

22:54.460 --> 22:56.157
Oh, we did.
We did.

22:56.331 --> 23:00.030
We made it to the top
of the Sagrada Família.

23:00.204 --> 23:01.902
This way.

23:02.076 --> 23:04.165
Wait.

23:04.339 --> 23:07.473
Let's do something
different this time.

23:07.647 --> 23:09.562
Let's make new memories.

23:09.736 --> 23:12.478
You're crazy.
- But you like it.

23:12.652 --> 23:15.045
- I think I do.
- This way.

23:15.219 --> 23:17.396
I feel so alive with you.

23:21.922 --> 23:23.793
I...

23:23.967 --> 23:26.405
You're very sweet,
crazy American.

23:28.494 --> 23:30.496
<i>Oye!</i>

23:30.670 --> 23:32.498
<i>Oy, Dios. Vamos.</i>

23:32.672 --> 23:34.021
- Hey.
- Run.

23:34.195 --> 23:35.370
<i>¿Cómo has podido?</i>

23:35.544 --> 23:37.981
- Who the hell is that?
- My husband!

23:42.072 --> 23:42.856
Yeah, I'll be right back.
I promise.

23:43.030 --> 23:45.032
No, no, no,
you stay right there.

23:45.206 --> 23:46.512
Okay, you admire that view.

23:50.820 --> 23:52.169
- Hi, Eli.
- Hi.

24:00.526 --> 24:01.483
Hi.

24:03.267 --> 24:06.227
- Hi.
- You do have a good smile.

24:06.401 --> 24:09.186
Sorry, uh, I kind of want
to be alone for a minute,

24:09.360 --> 24:11.058
and I am too old for you.

24:11.232 --> 24:12.668
The only reason you're even
talking to me is because

24:12.842 --> 24:14.104
the Island is giving me...
- No, no, no.

24:14.278 --> 24:15.454
This, like,
irresistible thing.

24:15.628 --> 24:17.630
I-I'm not hitting on you.

24:17.804 --> 24:19.458
- You're not?
- No.

24:19.632 --> 24:21.938
You're relieved?

24:23.940 --> 24:26.639
I thought being a chick magnet
was your fantasy.

24:26.813 --> 24:28.162
It was...

24:28.336 --> 24:30.338
Is...

24:30.512 --> 24:33.907
To be honest, I kind of thought
it would be more fun.

24:34.081 --> 24:35.648
You're not as shallow
as you thought you were.

24:35.822 --> 24:37.040
Yeah.

24:37.214 --> 24:39.695
Yeah, something like that.

24:39.869 --> 24:41.218
Anyway, you followed me
back here because...

24:41.392 --> 24:43.656
I have a question for you.

24:45.658 --> 24:47.703
Fugu sashimi.

24:47.877 --> 24:49.618
If prepared incorrectly,

24:49.792 --> 24:52.578
it can lead to a rapid
and rather violent death.

24:54.231 --> 24:56.843
- Are you trying to scare me?
- Little bit.

24:57.017 --> 25:00.281
Well, no luck.
I am fearless now.

25:00.455 --> 25:01.587
Excellent.

25:01.761 --> 25:03.850
Anyway, that glowering
goth girl from the plane

25:04.024 --> 25:05.852
puts me to shame
when it comes to courage.

25:06.026 --> 25:07.549
- Interesting.
- Yeah.

25:07.723 --> 25:11.161
Yeah, going around asking
people if they're your dad?

25:11.335 --> 25:12.989
I'm just eating pufferfish.

25:15.470 --> 25:16.558
All right.

25:22.651 --> 25:24.435
Oh, my God.
- Mm.

25:24.610 --> 25:26.612
- So good.
- So good.

25:28.265 --> 25:30.137
You know, perhaps,

25:30.311 --> 25:33.009
if you're getting tired
of being put to shame

25:33.183 --> 25:36.012
by a glowing goth girl,
you should take a moment

25:36.186 --> 25:39.755
and consider
what you're really afraid of.

25:39.929 --> 25:41.452
Helene said the same thing.

25:41.627 --> 25:44.760
Mm. Smart girl.

25:49.504 --> 25:53.334
He's been to Costa Rica,
St. Maarten, Kenya, and Spain,

25:53.508 --> 25:55.771
but not Belize.
- I'm sorry.

25:55.945 --> 25:58.992
I should stop.

25:59.166 --> 26:00.950
This is getting stupid.

26:03.300 --> 26:05.694
This dad guy--
he's not even looking for me.

26:05.868 --> 26:08.479
I mean, what if he doesn't
even care that I exist?

26:10.394 --> 26:13.136
You could take
another look at Mateo.

26:21.318 --> 26:23.364
He's gone.

26:23.538 --> 26:24.931
You're married?

26:25.105 --> 26:27.150
Don't be a prude.

26:27.324 --> 26:29.892
A prude?

26:30.980 --> 26:32.591
What?

26:32.765 --> 26:36.464
When I first met Sophie,
I thought she was uptight,

26:36.638 --> 26:39.075
but I asked her out
on a date anyway

26:39.249 --> 26:41.121
because she was really smart

26:41.295 --> 26:42.905
and she had this funny way
of looking at me,

26:43.079 --> 26:45.734
like she knew
when I was full of crap.

26:47.649 --> 26:50.696
And on our first date,
she told the dirtiest joke.

26:50.870 --> 26:52.611
Like, we're in
a nice restaurant

26:52.785 --> 26:54.743
and I laughed so hard,

26:54.917 --> 26:57.441
I got wine coming
out of my nose.

26:57.616 --> 26:59.574
If Sophie's so wonderful

26:59.748 --> 27:02.185
then why aren't you with her?

27:02.359 --> 27:04.535
Because I've been
holding on to a mirage.

27:04.710 --> 27:06.189
You.

27:06.363 --> 27:08.975
- I'm a mirage?
- I'm an idiot.

27:09.149 --> 27:11.630
The most incredible, hilarious
woman in the entire world,

27:11.804 --> 27:13.022
she's miraculously
in love with me.

27:13.196 --> 27:14.371
She wants to marry me,

27:14.545 --> 27:18.071
and I've been
comparing her to you.

27:18.245 --> 27:21.378
Okay, crazy man,
have a nice life.

27:21.552 --> 27:23.380
Oh, he will.

27:26.079 --> 27:29.299
Are you ready?
- I'm ready.

27:29.473 --> 27:31.911
- Let's go.
- Where are you going?

27:32.085 --> 27:33.782
I believe I'm going
to my bachelor party.

27:36.350 --> 27:38.526
<i>♪ The island's was magic,
is more than you see ♪</i>

27:38.700 --> 27:41.355
<i>♪ Yeah, ooh ♪</i>

27:41.529 --> 27:44.967
<i>♪ And love in the ocean
is paradise ♪</i>

27:45.141 --> 27:46.752
<i>♪ Oh, if I know
I want more and more ♪</i>

27:46.926 --> 27:48.536
<i>♪ Of love from the island ♪</i>

27:48.710 --> 27:50.146
<i>♪ Ooh ooh... ♪</i>

27:54.281 --> 27:56.936
Looks like I'm officially
getting married.

27:57.110 --> 27:59.547
- With no reservations?
- No reservations.

27:59.721 --> 28:01.288
You know, Mateo,
it's not uncommon--

28:01.462 --> 28:04.508
idealizing
the one who got away.

28:04.683 --> 28:06.859
Just don't let it
get in the way of...

28:08.817 --> 28:11.472
The right person?

28:11.646 --> 28:14.605
That a boy.

28:14.780 --> 28:15.824
Enjoy your party.

28:18.827 --> 28:20.742
Let's see what's up.

28:22.570 --> 28:25.355
Hi. Hey.

28:25.529 --> 28:28.358
Question.
Have you ever been to Belize?

28:28.532 --> 28:32.101
Yeah. Yeah, I love Belize.

28:32.275 --> 28:34.538
It's a crazy story actually.

28:34.713 --> 28:36.279
Any chance
there's a hurricane in it?

28:36.453 --> 28:38.412
Excuse me?

28:38.586 --> 28:40.980
Uh... I have something to say.

28:44.984 --> 28:47.029
Eli Cohen.

28:47.203 --> 28:49.640
I'm in love with you.

28:57.170 --> 28:58.649
I know that you
can't and won't

28:58.824 --> 29:00.216
love me the same way,

29:00.390 --> 29:02.915
but I just need
to tell you because

29:03.089 --> 29:04.481
you're amazing.

29:04.655 --> 29:08.398
Uh, that crazy story--
is there a woman with...

29:08.572 --> 29:09.748
Sorry, I gotta see this.

29:09.922 --> 29:12.228
I've never heard you say
an unkind word.

29:12.402 --> 29:14.404
Not even to that delivery guy
that dropped your pizza

29:14.578 --> 29:16.537
cheese-side down on the street
then put it back in the box.

29:18.191 --> 29:20.889
I'm Buddhist, and even
I wanted to beat him up.

29:22.456 --> 29:23.762
I knew he was
holding on to something big.

29:23.936 --> 29:24.980
Not anymore.

29:25.154 --> 29:28.679
And whenever I feel sad
or unworthy,

29:28.854 --> 29:32.161
you always have the right words
to make me feel better.

29:32.335 --> 29:35.425
You never get hangry.
You're kind.

29:35.599 --> 29:39.212
You leave food out
for that really cranky cat

29:39.386 --> 29:40.604
in the alley
behind your apartment,

29:40.779 --> 29:43.216
and you always open the doors,
and not just for old ladies.

29:43.390 --> 29:46.959
And I've been so scared
to tell you because...

29:47.133 --> 29:49.744
I was afraid of losing you
as my friend.

29:49.918 --> 29:52.007
But...

29:52.181 --> 29:55.794
when I'm not afraid,
I know I can handle it.

29:55.968 --> 29:58.187
So whatever happens,
I just... I want you to know...

29:58.361 --> 29:59.580
I love you too, man.

30:01.321 --> 30:04.237
Not that way.
- Oh, I know.

30:04.411 --> 30:07.109
But I love
the hell out of you.

30:07.283 --> 30:09.024
Wow. This is so awkward.

30:09.198 --> 30:11.853
Oh, it's gonna be for days
or weeks or years.

30:12.027 --> 30:14.073
We'll get through it.

30:14.247 --> 30:16.815
Wait, wait.
When were you in Belize?

30:16.989 --> 30:19.469
Um, a few years ago.

30:19.643 --> 30:23.647
That was gutsy, man.
I'm proud of you.

30:23.822 --> 30:25.911
Little offended
you don't love me, but...

30:26.085 --> 30:27.913
- Oh, shut up.
- He's got good taste.

30:28.087 --> 30:29.479
He's got good taste.

30:29.653 --> 30:30.785
This guy.
- Oh, shut up.

30:30.959 --> 30:32.091
Oh, you know.

30:36.225 --> 30:37.748
Congratulations
to all of you.

30:37.923 --> 30:39.663
I'm so happy the Island

30:39.838 --> 30:42.057
was able to give you
what you needed.

30:42.231 --> 30:45.539
Not in the way
you expected perhaps.

30:49.238 --> 30:52.285
- What was that about?
- She's right.

30:52.459 --> 30:54.765
Well, she's Roarke.
Of course she's right.

30:54.940 --> 30:56.245
What's she right about?

30:57.856 --> 30:59.640
I got what I needed.

30:59.814 --> 31:01.424
Which was not to be fawned over

31:01.598 --> 31:04.601
by a bunch of gorgeous women
who don't even know me.

31:04.775 --> 31:06.734
So what did you need, man?

31:06.908 --> 31:10.259
I think I really needed
to hear what you said about me.

31:10.433 --> 31:11.957
Like, really hear it.

31:14.394 --> 31:17.310
So, uh, remember when
I broke up with Evelyn?

31:17.484 --> 31:19.007
Oh, yeah.

31:19.181 --> 31:21.792
I didn't really break up
with Evelyn.

31:21.967 --> 31:25.100
She broke up with me.

31:25.274 --> 31:27.320
I know I said
she wasn't the one.

31:27.494 --> 31:30.453
The truth is
I kind of thought she was.

31:32.064 --> 31:34.370
And she broke up with me
on Valentine's Day.

31:34.544 --> 31:36.285
both:

31:36.459 --> 31:38.722
Ever since,
I just felt like...

31:38.897 --> 31:40.550
like no one's
ever gonna love me, you know?

31:43.466 --> 31:45.338
But what you said,

31:45.512 --> 31:48.515
it is the first time
I felt hopeful in months.

31:48.689 --> 31:51.170
And loveable.

31:51.344 --> 31:52.867
Am I blushing?
I feel like I'm blushing.

31:53.041 --> 31:54.913
Oh, you're totally blushing.

31:55.087 --> 31:56.653
So I never really liked Evelyn.

31:56.827 --> 31:58.351
So snooty.

31:58.525 --> 32:00.527
I never once saw her
wear comfortable shoes.

32:02.746 --> 32:05.488
Anyway, I finally feel like
I'm gonna be okay.

32:07.664 --> 32:09.057
What about you?
You okay?

32:09.231 --> 32:12.539
Yeah.
Yeah, I can move on now.

32:12.713 --> 32:13.932
You know, make take some time.

32:14.106 --> 32:14.889
I'm not gonna snap
fall out of love with you,

32:15.063 --> 32:17.674
but, uh, I'll get there.

32:19.894 --> 32:22.157
As long as I don't lose you
as my friend.

32:22.331 --> 32:23.942
Not possible.

32:24.116 --> 32:27.119
And I know there's someone
amazing out there for you.

32:27.293 --> 32:30.339
And he has to be
Eli and Mateo approved.

32:30.513 --> 32:32.211
Yes. Yes.

32:35.779 --> 32:39.392
And I thought I couldn't
feel more alone.

32:39.566 --> 32:41.524
Let's go for a walk.

32:50.272 --> 32:52.753
Your turn.

32:52.927 --> 32:54.973
Time to face your fear.

32:55.147 --> 32:58.193
The worst part is
I had this whole vision

32:58.367 --> 32:59.978
of how it was gonna be
meeting my dad.

33:00.152 --> 33:01.327
When I find him,

33:01.501 --> 33:04.373
he's gonna be happy
to know that I exist.

33:04.547 --> 33:06.593
I am so stupid.

33:06.767 --> 33:09.944
This island, it sucks.

33:10.118 --> 33:11.337
I'm sorry, Helene.

33:11.511 --> 33:13.730
Fantasy Island
delivers fantasies,

33:13.904 --> 33:15.602
not fairy tales.

33:15.776 --> 33:17.778
What you want and envisioned

33:17.952 --> 33:19.823
may be different
from what you need.

33:19.998 --> 33:22.130
What I need?

33:22.304 --> 33:24.350
I can't have what I need.

33:26.265 --> 33:28.702
I need my mom.

33:29.964 --> 33:33.141
God, she gave the best hugs.

33:33.315 --> 33:34.925
You know, when she hugged me,

33:35.100 --> 33:38.581
I just knew that
everything was gonna be okay.

33:38.755 --> 33:41.149
I sound so stupid because
it's not even possible,

33:41.323 --> 33:42.759
but I need a hug.

33:44.500 --> 33:46.589
I need a mom hug.

33:50.071 --> 33:51.855
Come with me.

33:52.030 --> 33:55.511
Oh, God.
Where are you taking me?

33:55.685 --> 33:57.296
Where you need to go.

34:08.002 --> 34:09.612
Ms. Roarke?

34:11.658 --> 34:14.226
Hey.

34:14.400 --> 34:16.924
Where did you come from?
Are you okay?

34:17.098 --> 34:19.187
Come here.

34:19.361 --> 34:21.146
Everything's gonna be okay.

34:24.714 --> 34:26.151
It's gonna be okay.

34:29.545 --> 34:33.984
I know it's scary,
but you're gonna be okay.

34:36.422 --> 34:39.642
Let's go.
It's not safe here.

34:39.816 --> 34:44.691
Hey, Blue, this way.
I found shelter.

34:44.865 --> 34:46.475
Come on!

34:46.649 --> 34:49.174
Hurry, I found somewhere safe.

Yeah, yeah,
I was named after a hurricane.

35:54.326 --> 35:56.763
No kidding.

35:56.937 --> 36:00.245
I was in the jungle
during Hurricane Helene.

36:02.377 --> 36:05.772
I didn't think I'd survive.

36:05.946 --> 36:06.642
In fact, I...

36:09.428 --> 36:11.691
I've carried this with me
ever since that night.

36:11.865 --> 36:13.736
Never forget it.

36:13.910 --> 36:16.043
St. Christopher's pendant
for protection.

36:17.958 --> 36:19.525
Yeah.

36:19.699 --> 36:21.918
Got us through the hurricane.

36:22.092 --> 36:23.964
I figured it must work.

36:26.706 --> 36:28.838
Um...

36:29.012 --> 36:32.886
I think that might've been
a gift from my mom.

Why the hell not?

38:12.072 --> 38:13.595
It's a cleansing ceremony.

38:31.352 --> 38:35.878
Isla, hi.
- Hi, Ruby.

38:36.052 --> 38:37.750
Where did you come from?

38:37.924 --> 38:40.143
I heard you were
looking for me.

38:40.318 --> 38:44.626
Yeah, well, we had a guest
that needed a tattoo and...

38:44.800 --> 38:46.541
It's perfect.

38:49.936 --> 38:53.156
Did you know
when you gave it to me

38:53.331 --> 38:55.376
what it meant?

38:55.550 --> 38:57.639
I knew it was important.

38:57.813 --> 39:00.076
That you were...

39:00.250 --> 39:03.253
are special.

39:08.650 --> 39:10.391
I have to go,

39:10.565 --> 39:14.569
but I swim here often at night.

39:14.743 --> 39:17.137
I hope to see you soon again.

39:20.923 --> 39:21.620
Isla.

39:39.812 --> 39:41.291
Can we talk?

39:48.864 --> 39:50.953
Best bachelor party ever.

39:51.127 --> 39:52.781
- Agreed.
- You slayed it.

39:52.955 --> 39:56.002
- Oh.
- Good luck to all of you.

39:56.176 --> 39:57.612
And thank you.

39:57.786 --> 40:01.311
- And thank you, extra.
- Oh, you bet.

40:02.312 --> 40:03.836
You know what?

40:04.010 --> 40:07.535
There is man out there
just for you, okay?

40:07.709 --> 40:09.319
Just let me know
when you find him.

40:09.494 --> 40:10.190
Hmm?
- Yeah.

40:24.247 --> 40:26.946
- Jeez, he is in a hurry.
- Let's wait a second.

40:31.951 --> 40:34.475
- Morning.
- Hey.

40:34.649 --> 40:38.000
- Can I get your bag?
- No.

40:38.174 --> 40:40.916
Oh, right.
Only daughter of a single mom.

40:41.090 --> 40:42.657
I didn't bring it.

40:44.833 --> 40:47.575
Uh, Ms. Roarke said
that I could stay awhile.

40:51.405 --> 40:53.581
If that's okay with you.

40:53.755 --> 40:56.454
Yeah, that's more than okay.

40:59.108 --> 41:00.109
This doesn't mean
we're gonna be all

41:00.283 --> 41:01.981
father and daughter-y
and stuff.

41:02.155 --> 41:02.808
I just...

41:04.984 --> 41:07.552
I figured we might as well
get to know each other.

41:09.336 --> 41:11.207
How about lunch later?

41:12.861 --> 41:14.559
I'd like that. Yeah.

41:16.299 --> 41:17.649
Cool.

41:19.346 --> 41:22.349
- All right.
- All right, I'll see you.

41:32.620 --> 41:35.101
Thank you.

41:35.275 --> 41:36.624
Thank you.

41:36.798 --> 41:38.670
I, uh, I wanted to ask her,

41:38.844 --> 41:40.889
but she just found out
I'm her dad.

41:41.063 --> 41:42.543
I didn't want to overstep.
Freak her out.

41:42.717 --> 41:44.589
So I overstepped for you.

41:44.763 --> 41:47.200
Did you know
when she got here?

41:47.374 --> 41:50.072
- No idea.
- I'm sorry, I just feel like

41:50.246 --> 41:53.293
I'm missing out
on something big.

41:53.467 --> 41:54.947
I'll let her explain.

41:59.473 --> 42:01.606
Um...

42:01.780 --> 42:04.347
I don't even know
where to begin.

42:04.522 --> 42:07.133
Sounds like a job
for a pitcher of mimosas.

42:08.961 --> 42:11.180
Definitely.

42:11.354 --> 42:16.446
I think life is about to get...
interesting on Fantasy Island.

42:16.621 --> 42:19.101
This is gonna be good.
