20:20.900 --> 20:21.767
AND THERE YOU HAVE IT.

20:21.767 --> 20:24.700
SHOCKING EVIDENCE
OF JOB DISCRIMINATION

20:24.700 --> 20:27.667
RIGHT HERE
IN SAN FRANCISCO.

20:28.233 --> 20:30.767
THANKS TO EDDIE THOMAS,
CHELSEA DANIELS,

20:30.767 --> 20:33.400
AND RAVEN BAXTER
FOR TAKING A STAND

20:33.400 --> 20:35.800
AND FOR GOING UNDERCOVER
FOR US.

20:35.800 --> 20:37.200
NICE LOOK, RAVEN.

20:37.200 --> 20:37.867
HEH HEH HEH.

20:37.867 --> 20:39.400
I REALLY DON'T THINK
YOU SHOULD BE LAUGHING,

20:39.400 --> 20:41.033
BECAUSE THAT'S YOU
IN ABOUT 30 YEARS.

20:41.033 --> 20:43.667
AS A RESULT
OF THIS INVESTIGATION,

20:43.667 --> 20:47.467
THE MANAGER CHLOE HUNTER
HAS BEEN FIRED.

20:47.467 --> 20:51.400
AND THE COMPANY
HAS ISSUED A PUBLIC APOLOGY.

20:51.400 --> 20:54.500
SEE? YOU GUYS CAN
MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

20:54.500 --> 20:55.934
YOU GUYS SHOWED
A LOT OF COURAGE.

20:55.934 --> 20:58.000
AS LONG AS THERE'S
PEOPLE LIKE THAT OUT THERE,

20:58.000 --> 20:59.700
IT'S UP TO US
TO STAND UP TO THEM.

20:59.700 --> 21:01.867
YEAH. I'M GLAD WE
DID IT TOGETHER,
YOU GUYS.

21:01.867 --> 21:04.500
YEAH. HEY, DAD,
DO YOU HAVE ANY MORE
OF THAT SOUL FOOD LEFT?

21:04.500 --> 21:06.200
I THINK I CAN
MAKE IT HAPPEN.

21:06.200 --> 21:07.200
YES!

21:07.200 --> 21:09.567
GET ON, THEN.
HEY, HEY!

21:15.000 --> 21:16.367
YOU KNOW, MR. BAXTER,
I DID NOT KNOW

21:16.367 --> 21:18.100
BLACK HISTORY
WAS SO DELICIOUS.

21:18.100 --> 21:19.500
WELL, I'M GLAD
YOU ALL ENJOYED IT.

21:19.500 --> 21:22.967
COREY, SHOULDN'T YOU
BE WORKING ON YOUR
HISTORY PROJECT?

21:22.967 --> 21:24.200
ALL DONE, DAD.

21:24.200 --> 21:26.300
500 WORDS OF GOLD.

21:26.300 --> 21:28.467
SO, WHO'D YOU FINALLY
WRITE ABOUT?

21:28.467 --> 21:30.600
SOMEONE CLOSE TO ME.

21:30.600 --> 21:34.100
WHO'S BEEN THERE
FOR AS LONG
AS I CAN REMEMBER.

21:34.367 --> 21:38.834
AW, IT IS SO CUTE
THAT I INSPIRE YOU.

21:38.834 --> 21:40.600
YOU?

21:40.600 --> 21:41.500
PLEASE.

21:41.500 --> 21:43.100
I PICKED SAM JACKSON.

21:43.100 --> 21:46.000
INVENTOR
OF MODERN ICE CREAM.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.600
FIGURES A BROTHER
WOULD INVENT
SOMETHING SO COOL.

21:48.600 --> 21:49.300
THAT'S WHAT I SAID.

21:49.300 --> 21:51.800
WE SHOULD GIVE IT UP
FOR MR. JACKSON.

21:51.800 --> 21:54.400
I MEANT THE ICE CREAM!

21:54.400 --> 21:56.200
NO!
