WEBVTT

00:11.344 --> 00:12.971
See? There it is.

00:13.054 --> 00:16.474
Definitive proof that
the laws of nature are breaking down,

00:16.558 --> 00:19.811
and the Earth as we know it
is officially doomed.

00:24.107 --> 00:25.108
Right.

00:26.276 --> 00:29.904
Yeah, I-- I can see how
some of these things could be problematic.

00:29.988 --> 00:31.823
Uh, frogs falling from the sky,

00:31.906 --> 00:34.576
plagues, random plane crashes.

00:34.659 --> 00:37.662
But reduced hiccups
and vanishing mosquitoes?

00:37.746 --> 00:40.081
I mean,
surely those last two should reside

00:40.165 --> 00:41.833
on a separate "tiny nuisance" board?

00:41.916 --> 00:43.126
Okay, fine.

00:43.209 --> 00:46.671
Maybe I haven't figured out
exactly what role hiccups will play

00:46.755 --> 00:51.134
in the world's final act,
but the dwindling mosquito population?

00:51.217 --> 00:53.511
I-- Ay, Dios mío!

00:54.012 --> 00:56.598
Mosquito numbers drop low enough,

00:56.681 --> 00:58.391
the whole ecosystem goes down

00:58.475 --> 01:00.477
like a triple-decker ice cream
on a hot summer day.

01:00.560 --> 01:04.689
We're talking aquatic life,
birds, all affected.

01:04.773 --> 01:08.985
We lose mosquitoes… we lose civilization.

01:09.986 --> 01:10.820
Oh.

01:11.404 --> 01:13.948
I was supposed to protect humanity.

01:14.032 --> 01:18.119
How could I fail to notice
something of this-- this magnitude?

01:18.203 --> 01:21.539
-Well, to be fair, none of us noticed.
-I noticed. Okay? I noticed.

01:21.623 --> 01:23.833
And I would have
figured it out a lot sooner

01:23.917 --> 01:28.004
if any one of you would have let me
into your little celestial in-crowd,

01:28.088 --> 01:29.214
but no!

01:29.297 --> 01:32.717
You guys had to play "sideline
the scientist," like everybody else.

01:32.801 --> 01:35.762
You need to become God, now.

01:35.845 --> 01:37.013
Hold up.

01:37.097 --> 01:39.390
I thought your dad was God.

01:40.308 --> 01:42.727
Father of angels,
best hugger in the world,

01:42.811 --> 01:45.480
because he literally invented hugs.

01:46.064 --> 01:47.065
It all made sense.

01:47.148 --> 01:50.568
Dad was God,
but then he retired to Mom's universe.

01:50.652 --> 01:52.028
Incommunicado as ever.

01:52.737 --> 01:56.157
Probably thinks that the apocalypse
is some sort of teachable moment.

01:56.241 --> 02:00.328
So, what, you're just
gonna become the new God now?

02:00.411 --> 02:02.372
He's not "just" doing anything, Ella.

02:03.414 --> 02:06.709
The whole angel war
was fought to win Lucifer that seat.

02:07.377 --> 02:09.295
Remiel died for it.

02:09.379 --> 02:10.964
Chloe died for it.

02:11.047 --> 02:11.965
You what now?

02:12.048 --> 02:14.551
We still have some things
we need to explain.

02:14.634 --> 02:18.012
Listen, it's been a long
and painful road for all of us,

02:19.180 --> 02:22.392
but the time has come
for Lucifer to ascend the throne.

02:26.146 --> 02:27.480
You're right, brother.

02:29.149 --> 02:30.191
It's time.

02:38.867 --> 02:41.619
Next time you see me, I'll be God.

02:41.703 --> 02:44.497
Ruler of Heaven and Earth.

02:53.965 --> 02:54.924
Earth…

02:55.508 --> 02:59.304
Why is he doing
that shruggy thingy with his shoulders?

02:59.387 --> 03:01.097
It's just-- this is very weird.

03:01.181 --> 03:04.225
Like, I can feel my wings in there,
but they don't just…

03:04.934 --> 03:07.228
They don't wanna pop out.

03:07.312 --> 03:10.607
I-- this has never happened
to me before. I--

03:11.357 --> 03:13.693
Gimme some room!
I'll give it a jump start.

03:14.277 --> 03:15.945
-Gimme some room!
-Okay!

03:19.157 --> 03:20.200
Lucifer…

03:20.283 --> 03:21.784
-Come on!
-I get it!

03:24.162 --> 03:24.996
Gimme a lift.

03:25.079 --> 03:26.414
Given what happened last time,

03:26.497 --> 03:29.918
I think it's probably best that you deal
with whatever this is before you go up.

03:30.501 --> 03:31.419
Good point.

03:31.502 --> 03:35.256
Lucifer, your-- your body self-actualizes,

03:35.340 --> 03:38.885
so, with everything that's been going on,
what if your wings aren't coming out

03:38.968 --> 03:41.930
because you feel
you're not ready to be God.

03:42.013 --> 03:44.933
-But I am ready. 
-Listen, we don't have time for this.

03:45.016 --> 03:47.769
I'll go to the Silver City
and try to figure out what's going on

03:47.852 --> 03:49.604
and try to stall whatever's happening.

03:49.687 --> 03:51.147
As for you, brother,

03:51.231 --> 03:53.650
you need to get your head on straight.

03:53.733 --> 03:55.360
-Silver City?

04:04.869 --> 04:05.870
Oh, my God.

04:06.454 --> 04:07.747
Amenadiel!

04:24.681 --> 04:25.807
Oh.

04:26.474 --> 04:28.977
So that's how it's supposed to work.

04:37.860 --> 04:39.404
-Come on!
-Okay!

04:40.738 --> 04:42.031
Well, now what?

04:42.115 --> 04:44.867
Okay, if you need
to get your head on straight,

04:45.994 --> 04:46.828
then…

04:48.246 --> 04:49.205
Right.

04:50.498 --> 04:51.457
Doctor!

04:54.002 --> 04:55.295
Doctor!

04:57.839 --> 04:59.841
Oh, for crying out loud. Doctor!

05:02.719 --> 05:03.886
-Aah!
-Don't worry.

05:03.970 --> 05:05.513
It's nothing I haven't seen before.

05:05.596 --> 05:08.391
Look, I'm sorry to wake you,
but it's an emergency.

05:09.017 --> 05:11.185
Oh. Hello.

05:11.853 --> 05:13.771
The sommelier from the wedding.

05:13.855 --> 05:15.398
Excellent taste, as always.

05:15.481 --> 05:18.359
What kind of emergency, uh,

05:18.943 --> 05:20.737
other than the end of the world?

05:20.820 --> 05:22.572
It's time, Doctor.

05:23.323 --> 05:24.824
Time for what?

05:24.907 --> 05:27.535
For the final therapy
of Lucifer Morningstar.

05:29.454 --> 05:30.663
For real, this time.

05:43.051 --> 05:47.930
Okay, I understand the possible end of
the world needs to be dealt with quickly,

05:48.014 --> 05:52.643
in the middle of the night, even,
but why did we have to come to my office?

05:52.727 --> 05:55.521
Because this is where
I do my best emotional processing.

05:55.605 --> 05:56.898
Right, of course.

05:59.859 --> 06:01.152
Okay, so what's the problem?

06:01.235 --> 06:03.738
Well, I can't save the world
till I'm on Dad's throne,

06:03.821 --> 06:07.033
and I can't get to Dad's throne
'cause my wings are on the fritz.

06:07.533 --> 06:11.287
-Okay, couldn't Amenadiel fly you up?
-Well, in theory, yes.

06:13.122 --> 06:15.875
But who's to say my body
won't self-sabotage some other way?

06:15.958 --> 06:17.502
I mean, I could burst into flames again,

06:17.585 --> 06:19.670
and not the, you know,
"Yay, I'm worthy" kind.

06:21.339 --> 06:24.300
Lucifer, you're right
that most performance issues

06:24.384 --> 06:26.260
are rooted in the mind.

06:26.344 --> 06:27.595
I beg your pardon.

06:27.678 --> 06:31.140
You of all people should know I've never
suffered from performance issues.

06:32.558 --> 06:34.352
-Oh, you mean the wings.
-Yeah.

06:34.435 --> 06:38.189
Right, yes, well, that is most likely
mental, rather than anatomical,

06:38.773 --> 06:42.318
which is why the fate of the world
literally rests in your capable hands.

06:42.402 --> 06:44.195
So, come on.

06:44.862 --> 06:45.863
Shrink me.

06:47.698 --> 06:48.991
Okay, just, um…

06:50.076 --> 06:52.578
Just give me a sec to think.

06:55.915 --> 06:57.291
Let's see…

07:00.545 --> 07:02.213
-What's that?
-Nothing.

07:04.924 --> 07:08.177
"Sympathy for the
My Time With Lucifer Morningstar."

07:08.261 --> 07:09.846
Doesn't look like "nothing" to me.

07:12.932 --> 07:13.850
Okay.

07:15.935 --> 07:17.395
This is happening.

07:18.146 --> 07:19.188
At00 a.m.

07:20.064 --> 07:20.982
Without a bra.

07:22.233 --> 07:23.693
Um…

07:26.237 --> 07:27.822
I've been writing a book…

07:28.948 --> 07:30.324
about you.

07:33.494 --> 07:34.454
Well…

07:37.290 --> 07:38.499
this is, uh…

07:39.792 --> 07:40.918
This is marvelous!

07:41.627 --> 07:45.214
I mean, Western literature has portrayed
me in a terrible light for centuries,

07:45.298 --> 07:48.384
starting with that perennial best-seller
that need not be named.

07:48.468 --> 07:49.969
Thanks for nothing, Gutenberg.

07:50.052 --> 07:54.182
Yeah, well,
it's-- it's just a first draft.

07:54.265 --> 07:56.392
Uh, a pre-first draft, really.

07:56.476 --> 08:00.021
I was just skimming over it in case
there was something useful, you know,

08:00.521 --> 08:03.232
from one of your past sessions…

08:03.316 --> 08:05.693
…you know,
considering I haven't had any sleep.

08:05.776 --> 08:07.236
Or coffee.

08:07.320 --> 08:09.113
The past.

08:09.197 --> 08:11.491
-Doctor, that's it.
-What is it?

08:11.574 --> 08:13.201
If everything
we've worked through together

08:13.284 --> 08:15.369
in the past five years is contained
in this book,

08:15.453 --> 08:17.955
then the answer to my little wing sitch
must be in here.

08:18.039 --> 08:20.666
So, all we need to do is find it.

08:20.750 --> 08:22.585
Oh, I don't think that's a good idea,
Lucifer.

08:22.668 --> 08:24.128
Quite a lot to read on borrowed time.

08:24.212 --> 08:26.047
That's just chapter one.

08:36.015 --> 08:37.391
That's the book.

08:38.601 --> 08:41.687
Right. Were you planning to go
full Dickens and get paid by the word?

08:41.771 --> 08:45.316
Unwieldy, right? Which is why I think
we should come up with another solution.

08:45.399 --> 08:48.194
-Hypnosis, visualization.

08:48.277 --> 08:51.697
I know a medicine man in Tarzana
who can do wonders with ayahuasca.

08:51.781 --> 08:53.908
Well, much as I love the psychedelics,
no need, doctor.

08:53.991 --> 08:56.577
Because all we need to do is
go through everything you've written,

08:56.661 --> 08:59.580
line by line, until we find the answer.

08:59.664 --> 09:02.083
We're gonna need a bigger office.

09:03.876 --> 09:06.629
Now don't think this means
I'm not still mad at you guys, okay?

09:06.712 --> 09:08.047
Because I totally am.

09:09.006 --> 09:10.508
But you can't have a sleepover

09:10.591 --> 09:13.427
without fuzzy slippers
and Korean face masks. You just can't.

09:14.428 --> 09:16.138
Wait. You said there would be five of us.

09:17.682 --> 09:18.683
Oh.

09:25.273 --> 09:26.107
What?

09:26.190 --> 09:29.485
You interrupt a demon on a wedding night,
you get what you get.

09:33.781 --> 09:35.658
So, in conclusion,

09:35.741 --> 09:38.578
if we divide and conquer
the doctor's sure-to-be-fascinating book,

09:38.661 --> 09:42.206
then we should be able to solve
my wingtuation in a snap.

09:42.290 --> 09:44.750
"Save the devil, save the world,"
as it were.

09:44.834 --> 09:47.420
Maybe Lucifer's problem
is he promises to help people out.

09:47.503 --> 09:51.007
-But then he just leaves them hanging.
-Yeah, good point, Dan.

09:51.591 --> 09:53.551
Dan? What? No-- no way!

09:53.634 --> 09:57.972
Are you-- are you telling me
that Dan is here, like, in this room?

09:58.055 --> 10:00.641
Yeah, he's a-- a ghost.

10:01.142 --> 10:02.518
Humans can't see him.

10:03.102 --> 10:04.604
Oh!

10:04.687 --> 10:06.439
Well, maybe your problem is

10:06.522 --> 10:08.941
that you're constantly
keeping secrets from people

10:09.025 --> 10:10.359
who care about you!

10:11.360 --> 10:13.195
-Maze, give Ella a message for me.
-No!

10:13.279 --> 10:16.866
No, I did not traipse over here
on my wedding night

10:16.949 --> 10:18.242
to be your Whoopi Goldberg.

10:18.326 --> 10:19.493
Hey, look, guys.

10:19.577 --> 10:22.913
Everybody's name is on this page,
so this might be a good place to start.

10:23.998 --> 10:27.960
"Lucifer sauntered into the precinct,
greeting all of his friends."

10:28.044 --> 10:30.254
Hello, precinct!

10:30.338 --> 10:33.758
Yes, it's me,
your favorite crime-solving devil.

10:33.841 --> 10:35.760
-Morning, Detective.
-Good morning.

10:35.843 --> 10:37.595
That's the case, all wrapped up.

10:37.678 --> 10:41.641
Clue, suspect, new clue, takedown.
Another murder solved.

10:42.224 --> 10:45.144
Crazy that the killer
was the first person we met.

10:45.728 --> 10:47.980
-What are the chances?
-I know!

10:48.064 --> 10:50.232
-Isn't it such a great day?

10:50.316 --> 10:52.234
Also, I have information for you.

10:52.318 --> 10:53.569
Science, gak.

10:53.653 --> 10:56.447
Super-duper cheery science gak.

10:56.530 --> 10:58.199
-Did you say "science"?
-Mm-hmm.

10:58.282 --> 11:00.868
That makes me think.
Yes, I just solved another murder.

11:00.951 --> 11:02.578
-Unbelievable.
-Hey, Chloe!

11:02.662 --> 11:05.373
-Here's the evidence you asked for.

11:05.456 --> 11:06.624
Oh, Dan.

11:06.707 --> 11:09.043
I think you--
you made a mistake.

11:09.126 --> 11:11.587
-But don't worry, I'll fix it. Again.

11:14.006 --> 11:16.425
Yep.

11:16.509 --> 11:17.426
You're welcome.

11:17.510 --> 11:20.179
-Two-for-one bounties. Kudos.
-Two and a half.

11:23.641 --> 11:25.434
Relax, dude.

11:25.518 --> 11:28.312
-He was like that when I found him.

11:28.396 --> 11:31.065
Dan, is something missing
from the evidence bag?

11:34.610 --> 11:35.736
Aww.

11:35.820 --> 11:36.987
Daniel.

11:41.617 --> 11:42.535
Oh.

11:42.618 --> 11:45.371
Cacuzza!
Were you under there the whole time?

11:47.748 --> 11:50.084
"Under." That makes me think.

11:50.918 --> 11:54.171
-I just solved another murder.
-How do you do it, Detective?

11:54.255 --> 11:56.716
You're so smart and beautiful and perfect,

11:56.799 --> 11:59.593
and we are the best partnership ever,
aren't we?

11:59.677 --> 12:00.761
-Yes.

12:00.845 --> 12:02.304
Oh, that reminds me.

12:02.388 --> 12:04.515
There's something important
I need to talk to you about.

12:04.598 --> 12:06.267
Something celestial in nature.

12:06.350 --> 12:08.686
Uh, Miss Lopez,
would you mind giving us a moment?

12:08.769 --> 12:11.647
Yes, yes,
I would love some more science gak.

12:11.731 --> 12:14.900
You got it, Decker, because I'm so happy
and everything is great!

12:14.984 --> 12:16.527
Isn't it?

12:17.361 --> 12:18.988
It's not, we have a problem.

12:19.071 --> 12:22.241
Nope! No, Lucifer epiphanies on this page.

12:22.324 --> 12:24.535
-Guess we'd better just move on!

12:24.618 --> 12:25.786
Okay.

12:30.166 --> 12:34.003
Did I mention this is a first draft
and hasn't been edited at all?

12:34.086 --> 12:37.798
Which means that that is exactly
what Lucifer said about us…

12:37.882 --> 12:39.675
"Technically," not "exactly."

12:39.759 --> 12:42.928
Apparently, he thinks
I'm nothing but sunshine and rainbows!

12:43.512 --> 12:46.474
-Not so "sunshine and rainbows" now, am I?

12:46.557 --> 12:47.516
Miss Lopez.

12:47.600 --> 12:51.228
Guess you don't really know me
any better than I thought I knew you.

12:52.521 --> 12:57.109
Well, to be fair, you do tend
towards a glass-half-full attitude.

12:57.193 --> 12:58.778
So I'd say the book is pretty accurate.

12:58.861 --> 13:02.198
Uh, yeah, of course you would say that.
I mean, you came out amazing.

13:02.281 --> 13:03.866
Well, I guess so.

13:03.949 --> 13:07.161
I don't know.
I think Lucifer nailed it with me.

13:07.244 --> 13:10.414
The sex, violence, kick-ass outfits.

13:10.498 --> 13:12.500
I mean, hello!

13:12.583 --> 13:14.960
Yeah, he got me right too.

13:15.669 --> 13:19.131
I never thought I'd say this about a book,
but I can't wait to dig in.

13:19.215 --> 13:22.051
Ho-ho! Neither can I.

13:26.305 --> 13:27.264
Ah…

13:27.348 --> 13:30.935
Doctor, I am beginning to suspect
you should have done a bit more editing

13:31.018 --> 13:33.145
before sharing your manuscript
with others.

13:34.230 --> 13:35.231
You think?

13:46.325 --> 13:48.452
Huh!

13:49.370 --> 13:51.580
I cannot believe you kept that from me.

13:52.665 --> 13:53.707
And that!

13:54.583 --> 13:55.417
And…

13:57.753 --> 14:02.591
I held an angel feather in my hand.

14:02.675 --> 14:06.095
And you let me believe it was from an emu?

14:06.178 --> 14:08.848
Oh, well,
I wouldn't get so upset about that.

14:08.931 --> 14:11.267
I mean,
given the information you had at the time,

14:11.350 --> 14:14.895
I'd say "emu feather"
was the most logical explanation.

14:14.979 --> 14:18.190
Now, can we just focus
on the matter at hand, please?

14:18.274 --> 14:20.109
-Huh? Me, wings…

14:24.655 --> 14:25.781
Not with the Spanish.

14:33.080 --> 14:38.085
You know, I'm used to indulging
Lucifer's unique therapeutic process,

14:38.168 --> 14:39.253
but…

14:40.337 --> 14:43.007
I'm starting to feel
like this is a mistake.

14:43.090 --> 14:44.675
Oh, God.

14:45.301 --> 14:49.930
Do you think I should remind them again
that this is just a rough draft?

14:50.014 --> 14:51.390
I don't know.

14:51.473 --> 14:52.975
At least I have you.

14:53.058 --> 14:55.936
Rational, reasonable Chloe.

14:56.020 --> 14:57.146
Always on task.

14:57.938 --> 14:59.648
Yep, that's me.

15:16.916 --> 15:20.002
Uh, should I speed up or slow down?

15:20.085 --> 15:21.378
You can read, right?

15:21.462 --> 15:24.256
Doesn't matter.
There's no surprises about me in here.

15:24.340 --> 15:27.551
It's just "corrupt cop,"
"shitty person." I get the gist.

15:27.635 --> 15:30.262
You are not a shitty person, Dan.

15:30.346 --> 15:33.307
You're literally reading
about the time we killed a guy, Maze.

15:38.812 --> 15:42.650
"Maze and Dan were
headed downtown, thirsty for justice."

15:57.748 --> 15:59.500
This is all my fault.

16:02.127 --> 16:05.589
Yeah, Dan, this is all your fault.

16:05.673 --> 16:09.259
The murderer who killed Chloe's dad
is walking around free…

16:11.220 --> 16:12.596
and it's all because of me.

16:14.431 --> 16:15.849
We have to do something.

16:17.643 --> 16:18.894
We can't kill him.

16:19.478 --> 16:20.771
You're right, Maze.

16:22.147 --> 16:23.357
We can't.

16:37.079 --> 16:37.955
The Russians!

16:40.249 --> 16:42.835
It's what we have to do.

16:44.586 --> 16:49.591
You think you're the one who
set the Russians up to murder that guy?

16:49.675 --> 16:52.469
No, please.
You're reading it all wrong.

17:07.276 --> 17:08.610
This is all my fault.

17:08.694 --> 17:11.822
Yeah, Dan, this is all your fault.

17:11.905 --> 17:15.034
The murderer who killed Chloe's dad
is walking free…

17:16.785 --> 17:19.621
and it's all because of me.

17:19.705 --> 17:21.165
We have to do something.

17:21.248 --> 17:22.916
Well, we can't kill him.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.752
Yeah, you're right, Maze. We can't.

17:33.010 --> 17:34.178
The Russians?

17:35.012 --> 17:37.347
It's what we gotta do. Come on.

17:39.224 --> 17:40.684
Okay, okay.

17:41.852 --> 17:43.604
You have your version. I have mine.

17:44.438 --> 17:46.523
Anyway, it doesn't really matter.

17:46.607 --> 17:48.442
What we did back there wasn't right.

17:49.109 --> 17:52.237
All right? But I spent a few thousand
years coming to terms with it.

17:52.321 --> 17:55.908
And I don't think it's the source
of my guilt. I just…

17:55.991 --> 17:58.911
I just wish I could
figure out what my real guilt is.

17:58.994 --> 18:01.497
Uh, well, what was in your hell loop?

18:01.580 --> 18:02.706
I don't know.

18:03.457 --> 18:04.792
I woke up, I…

18:05.542 --> 18:06.919
I relived my death a little.

18:07.002 --> 18:09.171
Then Lucifer would tap me
to play ping-pong with Belios.

18:09.254 --> 18:11.131
Oh, God…

18:11.215 --> 18:13.383
Wait, is that-- is that bad?

18:13.467 --> 18:15.010
Yeah, it's bad.

18:15.094 --> 18:17.596
Whatever a damned soul's
biggest source of guilt is,

18:17.679 --> 18:19.723
that's what goes on in his hell loop.

18:19.807 --> 18:21.683
No hell loop, no answers.

18:21.767 --> 18:25.312
So then, when Lucifer rescued me
from Hell's torture, he--

18:25.395 --> 18:27.564
-He totally screwed you.

18:28.482 --> 18:31.944
Hey, but don't worry. I can fix it.

18:33.570 --> 18:34.404
You can?

18:34.488 --> 18:36.532
Hello! Yeah, I'm a demon.

18:36.615 --> 18:38.909
I mean, I'm basically
a walking guilt detector.

18:38.992 --> 18:40.994
-Cheer up, dude.

18:41.078 --> 18:43.664
I'm gonna torture your ass
right into Heaven.

18:46.583 --> 18:49.002
Charlotte Richards was a goddess?

18:50.546 --> 18:52.506
Only-- only some of the time.

18:55.676 --> 18:56.593
Look…

18:58.387 --> 19:01.306
to play my advocate…

19:01.932 --> 19:03.976
…I have always told you the truth.

19:04.059 --> 19:06.228
I thought you were an actor.

19:08.021 --> 19:09.731
Was it fun for you guys,

19:10.649 --> 19:13.277
watching me walk around without a clue?

19:17.406 --> 19:20.117
Look, to be honest, Miss Lopez,

19:20.200 --> 19:24.955
I have always envied your ability
to accept the divine in absence of proof.

19:26.206 --> 19:28.625
I suppose that's what faith is, isn't it?

19:29.418 --> 19:31.378
I lost my faith, Lucifer.

19:32.796 --> 19:35.340
I lost my faith after Charlotte died.

19:36.341 --> 19:37.968
And not one of you

19:38.969 --> 19:42.097
told me that you knew
that she was in a better place.

19:43.348 --> 19:47.394
You didn't tell me that the Big Guy
was still up there, that he still cared.

19:49.521 --> 19:52.608
That single set of footprints in the sand…

19:54.318 --> 19:56.236
that was me…

19:56.320 --> 19:57.946
…walking alone.

19:58.030 --> 20:00.908
But you weren't alone.

20:00.991 --> 20:03.619
I mean, we--
we may not have spelled it out to you,

20:03.702 --> 20:06.705
but we were all there with you,
every step of the way.

20:07.289 --> 20:08.957
Every step of the way.

20:10.042 --> 20:13.503
Not to mention
what a great friend

20:13.587 --> 20:15.631
you've been to us celestials
over the years.

20:16.632 --> 20:19.718
Chilling with the Angel of Death
before you even met the rest of us.

20:19.801 --> 20:22.596
You and Azrael are practically BFFs.

20:24.973 --> 20:26.266
Wait, what?

20:29.353 --> 20:32.105
Oh, you haven't got
that part of the book. Here.

20:32.689 --> 20:36.818
Ray-Ray is the Angel of Death?!

20:37.611 --> 20:38.654
Uh…

20:43.033 --> 20:47.663
This is the worst idea
the doctor has ever had.

20:56.797 --> 20:57.798
Ever wonder

20:58.674 --> 21:01.969
what your hell loop would look like,
if you had one?

21:02.886 --> 21:03.845
Hmm.

21:07.599 --> 21:09.393
Mine would be…

21:10.435 --> 21:12.312
a room full of my friends…

21:13.313 --> 21:15.482
reading the first draft

21:15.565 --> 21:18.986
of my biggest
professional accomplishment ever…

21:20.070 --> 21:22.155
and hating it so much…

21:23.156 --> 21:25.492
that they'd rather complain about it…

21:26.451 --> 21:28.161
than save the world.

21:29.246 --> 21:31.957
Please tell me you have something.

21:33.000 --> 21:36.503
Anything, any-- any insights at all.

21:39.464 --> 21:41.341
Yeah, I think I have something.

21:57.274 --> 21:58.775
Lucifer.

22:00.944 --> 22:03.113
-Wait. You're leaving?
-Yeah, I'll call you later.

22:03.196 --> 22:04.197
Wait!

22:04.281 --> 22:05.615
You just stay here!

22:07.075 --> 22:08.285
It's my birthday.

22:09.077 --> 22:10.329
I have to go back.

22:10.412 --> 22:12.289
Don't go.

22:12.372 --> 22:13.457
Goodbye.

22:17.753 --> 22:20.047
-Hey, oh, my God, are you okay?
-Have you seen Lucifer?

22:20.130 --> 22:21.506
No, sorry.

22:22.090 --> 22:23.383
Where is he?

22:23.467 --> 22:26.720
You're on your deathbed,
and he's not there.

22:26.803 --> 22:27.971
He's never there.

22:31.725 --> 22:32.768
Oh, dear.

22:49.201 --> 22:50.911
Charlotte Richards.

22:51.495 --> 22:54.206
Yeah, she's dead because of you.

22:55.290 --> 22:58.710
She depended on you to protect her,
and you failed her.

23:02.923 --> 23:04.758
-Yeah, that's not it.

23:05.801 --> 23:09.888
I mean, I did blame myself for a while,
but Charlotte's death wasn't my fault.

23:09.971 --> 23:13.100
And honestly, it's kind of comforting
to know that at least she's in Heaven.

23:13.183 --> 23:15.477
Well,
what about your parents? Hmm?

23:15.560 --> 23:17.521
They're probably
really disappointed in you.

23:18.105 --> 23:19.356
I mean, look at you.

23:19.940 --> 23:23.527
Died of broken hearts
because of all your sad bullshit.

23:24.403 --> 23:28.365
Actually, my parents are
super proud of me and super alive.

23:28.448 --> 23:31.368
They're actually sponsoring
an improv troupe in my honor.

23:31.451 --> 23:35.455
The Danimal Crackers.

23:38.208 --> 23:39.709
What about siblings?

23:40.252 --> 23:43.755
I'm an only child, Maze.
Honestly, how do you not know this stuff?

23:52.472 --> 23:55.767
But you have someone
you care about as much as a sibling.

23:58.478 --> 23:59.438
What?

24:00.313 --> 24:02.274
-I would never hurt Ella.
-No.

24:02.357 --> 24:04.359
But you didn't help her either, did you?

24:05.110 --> 24:09.197
If you had told her the truth sooner,
you could have supported her,

24:09.739 --> 24:11.032
been there for her,

24:12.451 --> 24:14.161
while you were still alive.

24:15.370 --> 24:17.038
Yeah, you're not crazy.

24:17.122 --> 24:21.501
No, no, you were--
you were just friends with an angel.

24:21.585 --> 24:24.337
The Angel of Death.

24:24.421 --> 24:27.716
Which is-- is totally normal.

24:27.799 --> 24:31.595
Yeah, just like, uh,
just like your ghost buddy Dan,

24:31.678 --> 24:34.931
who you can't see or talk to.

24:35.015 --> 24:37.976
Uh, Dan wants to talk to you.

24:41.188 --> 24:42.772
Oh, uh…

24:43.565 --> 24:45.400
Wow. Okay, cool, um…

24:46.943 --> 24:48.778
Hey, Dan.

24:49.696 --> 24:51.281
Um…

24:51.990 --> 24:57.412
I'm so sorry I didn't say this sooner,
but I really miss you so, so much,

24:57.496 --> 25:00.415
and I even named a frog after you.

25:00.499 --> 25:03.668
Tell her I met frog Dan.

25:04.461 --> 25:08.381
And I'm super flattered,
and tell her that I really miss her too.

25:08.465 --> 25:10.634
Also-- also,
tell her that her favorite beaker

25:10.717 --> 25:12.636
rolled behind her filing cabinet
last week.

25:12.719 --> 25:15.514
-She's been looking for that.
-He said, "Yo."

25:16.223 --> 25:18.642
-I mean, what?
-I am summarizing.

25:20.060 --> 25:22.437
Just show her the thing, okay, please?

25:23.021 --> 25:24.814
Dan wants you to read this.

25:26.441 --> 25:28.693
Oh, okay.

25:30.612 --> 25:32.864
You guys, this is so weird.

25:32.948 --> 25:36.409
So, cult, led by killer priest,
commits mass suicide.

25:36.493 --> 25:37.994
-Now, that I get.
-Hmm.

25:38.078 --> 25:42.040
I mean, I don't "get it" get it,
but cult, suicide, it works.

25:42.123 --> 25:46.419
Now, what I don't get is some
of these bodies are thrashed.

25:46.503 --> 25:50.632
Yeah, yeah, I think they were
into some pretty weird stuff.

25:50.715 --> 25:53.510
-Yes, uh, downright demonic, I'd say.

25:54.094 --> 25:55.303
I don't know.

25:55.387 --> 26:00.183
It's almost like some
of these bodies died twice.

26:00.767 --> 26:02.811
Twice? What--

26:02.894 --> 26:05.230
Twice?
That would be impossible, right, Lucifer?

26:05.313 --> 26:07.107
-I mean…

26:09.359 --> 26:11.778
Yeah, yeah, that's…

26:11.861 --> 26:14.656
I-- I just must be off my game today. Uh…

26:15.323 --> 26:17.951
I'll just keep this part off the report.

26:18.034 --> 26:20.495
-Yeah. God…

26:22.581 --> 26:23.873
Oh!

26:25.041 --> 26:26.668
Oh, okay, I get it.

26:26.751 --> 26:30.755
So, I am just a super-gullible dummy

26:30.839 --> 26:34.634
who's been covering up your celestial
shenanigans for years!

26:34.718 --> 26:38.346
Ella, the unwitting accomplice,
strikes again!

26:38.430 --> 26:41.474
Uh, Dan wants you to keep reading.

26:44.394 --> 26:45.895
Uh, please.

26:50.150 --> 26:53.028
What would
we do without Ella, huh?

26:53.111 --> 26:56.031
Well, for one,
I'd be short a half-angel nephew.

26:56.114 --> 26:58.116
I just wish we could tell her the truth.

26:58.199 --> 27:02.037
Well, so do I, but as we've established,
humans don't tend to react that well

27:02.120 --> 27:05.665
when they find out there are
actual angels and demons running around,

27:06.333 --> 27:08.918
even if they already know
the truth in their hearts.

27:12.130 --> 27:13.298
Yeah, okay.

27:14.090 --> 27:16.718
So I helped save Charlie
after he was kidnapped.

27:16.801 --> 27:18.970
That is literally my job.

27:19.721 --> 27:22.015
You know, this whole time,

27:22.807 --> 27:25.435
I really thought
that I was part of the inner circle.

27:27.520 --> 27:28.688
But I wasn't.

27:29.230 --> 27:32.609
I was just a lonely tangent.

27:36.488 --> 27:38.531
Yeah, um…

27:39.491 --> 27:43.995
Dan says that, while you
may not have known the specifics,

27:45.038 --> 27:47.832
that everyone here
always loved and trusted you, Ella.

27:49.959 --> 27:51.461
No, I am not saying that.

27:57.300 --> 28:00.679
Dan says you are the inner circle.

28:05.100 --> 28:09.145
If you guys really trusted me,
you would have told me the truth.

28:13.316 --> 28:14.275
Ella…

28:19.239 --> 28:20.156
Chloe!

28:22.200 --> 28:23.618
I'm out here.

28:27.622 --> 28:28.748
What's wrong?

28:31.209 --> 28:32.085
Well, uh…

28:34.379 --> 28:37.173
in the book, you make me sound…

28:37.924 --> 28:39.008
amazing.

28:40.760 --> 28:43.722
Yes, I can see how
that would be upsetting.

28:46.182 --> 28:50.729
What if you think
I'm smart and-- and beautiful

28:50.812 --> 28:52.355
and "perfect"…

28:53.606 --> 28:57.193
because you've never stuck around
long enough to see me at my worst?

28:57.277 --> 28:59.612
Oh, well,
now you're just making things up.

29:03.199 --> 29:06.828
When-- when Rory said
that you weren't at my deathbed,

29:07.829 --> 29:09.706
you know, I thought, uh…

29:10.457 --> 29:11.666
"That's impossible."

29:12.500 --> 29:15.545
"Lucifer would never abandon me."

29:16.129 --> 29:17.797
But reading this, I realize…

29:17.881 --> 29:19.549
Of course you would.

29:19.632 --> 29:21.843
You've done it so many times before.

29:23.052 --> 29:24.721
-Have I?
-Yes!

29:24.804 --> 29:27.515
Every time we've had
an emotional breakthrough,

29:27.599 --> 29:30.560
you've-- you've immediately
gone off and disappeared.

29:30.643 --> 29:33.480
Oh, come on, that can't be true.

29:33.563 --> 29:34.773
No, listen to me.

29:35.940 --> 29:37.192
And now…

29:38.026 --> 29:39.527
you've told me you love me.

29:39.611 --> 29:43.490
It's the biggest breakthrough
we've ever had.

29:44.657 --> 29:48.119
So I just wonder,
how do I know you won't follow it up with…

29:50.205 --> 29:52.332
My biggest-ever disappearing act.

29:55.210 --> 29:56.669
Chloe…

29:59.214 --> 30:02.342
I would never choose to abandon you.

30:03.092 --> 30:05.345
-But you can't know that.
-Yes, I can.

30:06.179 --> 30:07.722
Because it's my choice.

30:10.600 --> 30:11.684
Okay…

30:12.727 --> 30:17.190
Like-- like it's your choice
to whip out your wings right now?

30:18.566 --> 30:21.361
Like it's your choice
whether or not to let me in?

30:33.081 --> 30:33.957
Lucifer.

30:36.501 --> 30:38.044
-What's happening to me?

30:45.635 --> 30:47.637
You know, I wore this for so many years

30:47.720 --> 30:52.600
because it proved that you chose
to be vulnerable around me, but…

30:54.352 --> 30:57.730
But now it's not you that decided that,
it's your subconscious.

30:57.814 --> 31:02.110
Your-- your subconscious
chose to-- to have a devil face

31:02.193 --> 31:04.571
or to bring out your wings.

31:04.654 --> 31:07.740
And-- and reading all of this,
I mean, seeing it all laid out,

31:08.324 --> 31:09.325
I just wonder…

31:11.452 --> 31:14.205
if your subconscious
might choose not to stay.

31:15.665 --> 31:16.583
No.

31:19.002 --> 31:21.337
No, I'm sorry, but I don't accept that.

31:22.672 --> 31:23.548
I've changed.

31:23.631 --> 31:27.594
I've-- I've grown. I mean,
it's all in here, isn't it?

31:27.677 --> 31:28.595
It's…

31:31.431 --> 31:32.265
What?

31:33.391 --> 31:34.475
What is it?

31:37.270 --> 31:39.063
There's something wrong with this book.

31:45.028 --> 31:46.738
Gather round, people.

31:47.822 --> 31:49.699
The doctor has deceived us all.

31:49.782 --> 31:52.869
This manuscript that she's brought
cuts off mid-sentence.

31:53.536 --> 31:57.165
Because you didn't bring
the end of the book with you, did you?

31:57.874 --> 31:58.875
You know what?

31:59.792 --> 32:00.627
It's true.

32:01.294 --> 32:03.254
I kept the end of the book in my office.

32:04.255 --> 32:06.758
But if this book is
a case study on Lucifer,

32:06.841 --> 32:08.718
all of the important
psychological insights

32:08.801 --> 32:10.553
would be in the last chapter, right?

32:10.637 --> 32:12.305
So-- so why are you hiding it?

32:12.388 --> 32:14.933
It is my job
to guide patients on their journey,

32:15.016 --> 32:16.851
not give them the answers.

32:16.935 --> 32:19.520
Wait a second, the world is ending,

32:19.604 --> 32:22.440
and you guys are all
still keeping secrets from each other?

32:22.523 --> 32:24.859
-What is wrong with you people?
-Nope.

32:24.943 --> 32:27.695
None of this was my idea.

32:27.779 --> 32:30.031
No one was supposed to read my manuscript,

32:30.114 --> 32:32.909
least of all
the patient that I was studying,

32:32.992 --> 32:34.744
because it's a first draft!

32:35.328 --> 32:38.039
Maybe years from now,
when the book is published--

32:38.122 --> 32:40.416
She's gonna publish this?
My parents are gonna see this!

32:40.500 --> 32:42.585
Shut up, Daniel, this is not about you!
It's about me.

32:48.383 --> 32:50.969
You held back
the end of the book…

32:51.970 --> 32:54.514
because you think I'll fail, don't you?

32:56.057 --> 32:58.851
My own therapist doesn't actually believe
that I'll become God.

33:11.447 --> 33:14.784
-Guess the party's over, huh?
-Yep.

33:16.744 --> 33:20.707
Dude, that is literally
the most depressing thing I've ever seen.

33:20.790 --> 33:23.126
Turns out
I didn't have anywhere else to go.

33:23.209 --> 33:24.419
Yeah, well, I do.

33:25.211 --> 33:26.212
Yeah.

33:32.844 --> 33:33.845
Okay.

33:34.846 --> 33:38.057
So let's skip the usual foreplay
and get straight to the main event.

33:38.683 --> 33:39.559
Okay?

33:40.143 --> 33:44.355
If you saw
the moment of your death in Hell,

33:44.439 --> 33:45.523
that's the key.

33:45.606 --> 33:48.651
You relive your death,
you find your guilt.

33:48.735 --> 33:51.070
Yeah, I've been there, done that.

33:51.154 --> 33:53.448
-Didn't learn a damn thing.
-Mnh-mnh.

33:54.490 --> 33:57.535
That cold, gnawing fear
in the pit of your stomach…

33:58.870 --> 33:59.746
Feel that?

34:00.872 --> 34:01.831
Yeah.

34:01.914 --> 34:03.207
That's your guilt.

34:04.625 --> 34:08.921
Now you can spend the next thousand years
running away from it like a weak human,

34:10.798 --> 34:12.175
or you can dig in…

34:13.301 --> 34:15.553
and sniff that shit out like a demon!

34:38.576 --> 34:39.952
Maze, I think you cracked it.

34:41.746 --> 34:43.539
I know what I need to do.

34:50.588 --> 34:52.131
Oh, hey.

34:52.215 --> 34:55.676
Don't even know why the doctor's bothering
to bring back the rest of the book.

34:56.803 --> 34:58.805
I'm not capable of real change.

34:59.931 --> 35:02.058
-Lucifer, that isn't true.
-Isn't it?

35:03.226 --> 35:05.436
I mean, at least I don't think it is.

35:07.271 --> 35:09.899
What I do know is how much
you've grown since I've met you.

35:09.982 --> 35:11.192
But not enough.

35:12.401 --> 35:15.780
Honestly, I-- I don't know if it's enough.

35:16.781 --> 35:20.118
What I said back there, I was scared.

35:20.201 --> 35:21.577
You know, I am scared.

35:23.579 --> 35:27.291
I know you don't think you'll
disappear, and I wanna believe that,

35:27.375 --> 35:28.709
but if you're wrong,

35:29.460 --> 35:32.088
and I'm gonna be a mom with two girls,

35:32.713 --> 35:34.257
working at the LAPD.

35:34.340 --> 35:38.302
You're going back to the LAPD?

35:40.054 --> 35:40.930
I know.

35:41.889 --> 35:45.351
I know it wasn't our plan,
and I understand if you're upset.

35:46.519 --> 35:47.436
No.

35:48.563 --> 35:49.897
No, I understand.

35:52.108 --> 35:55.945
I mean, it's who you are, isn't it? Hmm?

35:57.613 --> 35:59.365
My detective.

35:59.448 --> 36:01.993
I could never
be upset with you about that.

36:04.162 --> 36:07.748
And while there is a remote possibility

36:07.832 --> 36:12.962
that I may idolize you
a little too much… 

36:13.045 --> 36:15.047
…I do know you're an amazing mother.

36:17.216 --> 36:19.510
I wasn't an amazing mother to Rory.

36:20.094 --> 36:22.847
-What do you mean?
-Just look at her wings, Lucifer.

36:22.930 --> 36:24.015
I mean…

36:25.349 --> 36:27.518
I just think,
did I not protect her enough?

36:27.602 --> 36:29.187
Did I not make her feel safe?

36:29.270 --> 36:30.813
How badly did I screw up

36:30.897 --> 36:33.608
that I made our daughter
self-actualize as a weapon?

36:33.691 --> 36:34.942
Oh, right, yes.

36:35.026 --> 36:38.112
I wonder where Rory got
her persecution complex from.

36:38.196 --> 36:42.325
Certainly not from the angel
who literally invented teenage rebellion.

36:42.408 --> 36:45.328
Blade wings? Devil face?

36:45.411 --> 36:47.538
-It's all the same, isn't it?

36:47.622 --> 36:48.956
No, it isn't.

36:52.251 --> 36:53.294
Rory.

36:53.961 --> 36:55.004
Rory!

36:55.630 --> 36:57.757
-Uh…
-Hello!

36:57.840 --> 37:01.469
-What-- what are you doing here?
-Mom said you guys were saving the world.

37:01.552 --> 37:04.180
I thought I'd stop by
to see how it was going.

37:04.263 --> 37:06.515
Gotta say, I kind of wish I hadn't.

37:06.599 --> 37:08.309
Hindsight's a bitch, huh?

37:08.392 --> 37:11.145
-Rory.
-Wait, Rory, hold on.

37:12.230 --> 37:16.359
I think-- we--
we think your wings are amazing.

37:16.943 --> 37:18.903
I just-- I hope that you didn't

37:19.695 --> 37:22.823
feel that you had
to fight or protect yourself

37:22.907 --> 37:24.325
when you were younger. Uh…

37:25.493 --> 37:29.497
As your mom, I-- I hope
that I always made you feel safe.

37:31.374 --> 37:35.044
I-- I don't have these wings
because of something you did wrong.

37:36.504 --> 37:39.257
I-- I have them
because of something you did right.

37:40.466 --> 37:42.176
I mean, all my life,

37:42.260 --> 37:44.845
I watched you stand up for justice.

37:45.554 --> 37:48.099
I love these badass wings

37:48.182 --> 37:52.103
'cause they remind me
of the person I admire most.

37:53.729 --> 37:54.730
My mom.

37:55.940 --> 37:57.900
Really?

37:58.484 --> 37:59.402
Really.

38:00.569 --> 38:04.115
These wings are like,
they're one of a million

38:04.198 --> 38:07.243
wonderful, powerful things
that you gave me.

38:08.744 --> 38:10.288
Unlike him.

38:11.038 --> 38:14.834
Well, your angel dad probably
had something to do with your wings.

38:14.917 --> 38:17.420
-Right.
-Lucifer left both of us.

38:18.212 --> 38:20.089
How can you still defend him?

38:21.007 --> 38:24.385
Well, Rory, I mean, your--
your dad is flawed.

38:24.468 --> 38:25.678
We all are, and…

38:27.013 --> 38:30.516
I mean, although I'm nervous
about what the future holds, I…

38:31.017 --> 38:34.103
I guess, deep down,
I just really trust him.

38:34.186 --> 38:38.107
Why? He doesn't even trust himself.
He doesn't know his own feelings.

38:38.190 --> 38:41.694
He had to get hit by a bullet
to figure out he cared about you.

38:41.777 --> 38:43.904
Yeah, I heard you guys talking earlier.

38:43.988 --> 38:46.449
-That's not necessarily fair.
-No.

38:47.158 --> 38:49.535
She's right.

38:50.286 --> 38:52.997
She is right.

38:57.251 --> 38:59.503
Lucifer, what are you doing?

39:03.341 --> 39:04.592
What's this supposed to be?

39:06.510 --> 39:10.014
I know how I feel about you,
and I am going to prove it, young lady.

39:10.097 --> 39:14.477
I am gonna make myself vulnerable
right here, right now, for you.

39:14.560 --> 39:16.395
So go on, shoot me.

39:16.979 --> 39:19.899
Okay, we do not shoot people
in this family.

39:19.982 --> 39:22.443
I don't know, Mom.
I think we established we totally do.

39:22.526 --> 39:25.321
I think she's got you there.
Move aside, please.

39:25.404 --> 39:28.949
I am your father,
and I demand that you shoot me!

39:29.033 --> 39:31.577
Rory, don't listen to him.
Just put down the gun.

39:31.660 --> 39:34.288
Ah-ah-ah-ah! It's the only way
she's gonna believe me.

39:34.372 --> 39:35.623
Come on, Rory.

39:35.706 --> 39:37.875
You've wanted to hurt me
ever since you got here.

39:37.958 --> 39:39.835
Now's your chance. Pull that trigger.

39:42.171 --> 39:43.714
-Come on.

39:43.798 --> 39:46.675
-Go on, shoot me!

39:54.308 --> 39:55.976
I knew he couldn't do it.

40:10.616 --> 40:11.784
-Lucifer.

40:17.957 --> 40:22.211
Don't you two ever
do anything like that ever again.

40:22.795 --> 40:24.296
Promise.

40:25.214 --> 40:27.550
-It worked.
-Of course it worked.

40:28.467 --> 40:29.718
You're my daughter.

40:30.428 --> 40:31.554
And I love you.

40:34.515 --> 40:37.309
You asked for it?
Well, here it is!

40:37.977 --> 40:38.936
Lucifer.

40:40.521 --> 40:41.689
Are you bleeding?

40:41.772 --> 40:44.233
Yes, I am!

40:44.316 --> 40:45.693
But don't worry about that.

40:46.444 --> 40:47.486
Hand it over.

40:48.237 --> 40:50.865
It's time to see
how this story really ends.

41:12.511 --> 41:14.430
Thank you, Dr. Linda.

41:16.515 --> 41:18.350
In the five years
that we've worked together,

41:18.434 --> 41:21.604
it's you who has given me
the insight, the wisdom,

41:22.188 --> 41:23.731
to ascend the throne of Heaven.

41:25.774 --> 41:29.487
Some might say you've been a godsend.

41:55.804 --> 41:59.517
I, Lucifer Morningstar, the Devil,

42:00.518 --> 42:04.897
have returned to Heaven
to rule as God Almighty.

42:06.732 --> 42:08.901
And it's all thanks to one woman.

42:10.319 --> 42:12.404
A woman with the mind of a genius,

42:13.280 --> 42:14.990
the patience of a saint.

42:16.408 --> 42:20.162
A woman I adore with all of my heart.

42:21.914 --> 42:26.168
The greatest therapist
the world has ever known,

42:26.252 --> 42:29.380
Dr. Linda Martin, MD,

42:29.463 --> 42:35.219
PsyD, PhD, MA, MPhil,

42:35.302 --> 42:38.389
Master in Science, Master in Technology,

42:38.472 --> 42:40.140
Master of the Universe, Ma--

42:40.849 --> 42:43.477
This is preposterous.

42:43.561 --> 42:45.854
I mean, socks with sandals?

42:45.938 --> 42:47.565
What? Your dad wore them.

42:47.648 --> 42:50.484
But, Linda,
is this what you really think happens?

42:51.110 --> 42:53.320
I don't know what's going to happen.

42:53.904 --> 42:56.865
I've been the therapist to the Devil
for the last five years,

42:56.949 --> 42:58.784
and I still couldn't
get him ready to be God.

42:59.535 --> 43:02.705
-I'm a failure.

43:02.788 --> 43:05.583
So I wrote a fake ending
to make myself feel better.

43:05.666 --> 43:08.294
Okay, so seriously, why are you bleeding?

43:08.377 --> 43:10.129
Oh, my daughter shot me.

43:10.212 --> 43:11.338
What?

43:11.422 --> 43:13.799
No, don't worry.
It was completely consensual.

43:13.882 --> 43:16.385
I self-actualized vulnerability
to prove a point.

43:18.762 --> 43:19.763
Lucifer…

43:21.015 --> 43:23.225
your conscious and subconscious mind

43:23.934 --> 43:25.728
are finally acting in concert.

43:27.229 --> 43:28.522
Do you know what this means?

43:29.982 --> 43:30.858
That…

43:31.650 --> 43:35.988
I no longer have to let my wings choose
whether or not I'm gonna be God.

43:50.502 --> 43:51.545
So…

43:53.672 --> 43:55.591
you're finally ready to be God.

43:57.426 --> 43:58.260
I am.

43:59.928 --> 44:02.723
I am ready to be God.

44:09.938 --> 44:11.440
But I'm choosing not to be.

44:13.192 --> 44:14.276
What?

44:14.360 --> 44:17.237
Reading the doctor's
ridiculous denouement,

44:17.321 --> 44:21.033
reliving everything that
we've been through here on Earth,

44:21.700 --> 44:26.163
seeing how certain you are
about who you are, what you are…

44:26.872 --> 44:28.624
It's made me realize, I--

44:29.541 --> 44:31.460
I don't want to be God.

44:33.045 --> 44:34.672
-So I'm not going to be.

44:35.714 --> 44:38.384
I mean, I think, deep down, I've--

44:39.134 --> 44:41.845
I've always known
it wasn't really my calling.

44:42.429 --> 44:43.347
I-- I…

44:43.972 --> 44:46.141
I've no idea what my calling is,

44:46.225 --> 44:48.352
but I do know it's not me being God.

44:50.020 --> 44:52.189
I hope you're not
too disappointed by that.

44:52.272 --> 44:54.358
No, I'm not disappointed.

44:55.984 --> 44:58.487
I could never be
disappointed by who you are.

44:59.571 --> 45:00.989
I told you, I trust you.

45:02.908 --> 45:07.246
I have no idea why
you always have so much faith in me.

45:12.000 --> 45:12.876
I do.

45:18.048 --> 45:23.095
I mean, my whole life I listened to Mom
talk about how much she loved you.

45:25.055 --> 45:28.183
Uh, kind of felt sorry for her, honestly.

45:29.643 --> 45:34.481
But reading this,
I get to see things from the other side.

45:35.149 --> 45:37.359
-Chloe.

45:37.443 --> 45:38.861
I don't wanna die.

45:38.944 --> 45:40.070
I won't let you.

45:43.157 --> 45:48.036
If you're up there,
all I ask is that you protect Chloe.

45:55.127 --> 45:56.920
Detective! No!

45:59.089 --> 46:00.382
You're okay.

47:13.705 --> 47:17.209
I choose you, Chloe.

47:19.461 --> 47:21.755
Because I love you.

47:24.883 --> 47:27.970
It's, uh, good to know that he loved you--

47:29.388 --> 47:31.348
Loves you back.

47:31.932 --> 47:34.768
Rory, I hope that you know now

47:34.852 --> 47:38.063
that he feels
the exact same way about you.

47:41.233 --> 47:43.068
Yeah, I think I do.

47:43.819 --> 47:49.199
The emotional progress you're
all making here is really so beautiful.

47:49.283 --> 47:51.159
But, you know, it almost makes me forget

47:51.243 --> 47:53.412
about the whole
"end of the world" situation.

47:53.495 --> 47:56.957
Oh, right, that. Buzzkill Doctor.

47:57.040 --> 47:58.584
Well, don't worry.

47:58.667 --> 48:02.546
I'm sure, uh,
Amenadiel will figure it out.

48:02.629 --> 48:03.714
He always does.

48:11.054 --> 48:12.890
-Hey.
-Hey.

48:17.227 --> 48:18.228
So…

48:22.524 --> 48:24.026
Thanks for picking me up.

48:25.736 --> 48:26.653
Yeah.

48:28.614 --> 48:29.615
Sorry I…

48:30.574 --> 48:32.784
kind of ditched you at the wedding.

48:34.703 --> 48:36.163
Big emergency.

48:38.707 --> 48:42.502
You ever have one of those friends that,
every time they have a problem,

48:42.586 --> 48:43.837
it winds up becoming--

48:43.921 --> 48:45.297
The end of the world?

48:45.380 --> 48:48.342
Yeah, well, I'm--
I'm really glad that you get it

48:48.425 --> 48:52.804
because I've got five of those.

48:54.932 --> 48:56.892
Six, I guess.

48:58.435 --> 49:00.395
Just so you know.

49:01.063 --> 49:02.022
Okay.

49:03.857 --> 49:05.400
So what's the word, then?

49:05.484 --> 49:08.195
Is the crisis averted or…?

49:08.278 --> 49:09.488
Not yet.

49:11.823 --> 49:14.534
But, you know,
given everything we've been through,

49:14.618 --> 49:18.413
I'd say I'm cautiously optimistic.

49:19.831 --> 49:21.291
-Good.

49:22.751 --> 49:24.628
I'm so sorry, I know…

49:25.963 --> 49:29.466
I know that's like,
"Welcome to Vague Town, population you."

49:30.842 --> 49:34.596
Carol, I really wish
that I could tell you more.

49:34.680 --> 49:36.139
I-- I do, but…

49:38.809 --> 49:40.978
It's just not my secret to share.

49:41.061 --> 49:42.562
Ella…

49:45.107 --> 49:46.358
That's fine.

49:47.150 --> 49:48.360
I know who you are.

49:49.152 --> 49:52.656
And-- and I trust our relationship,
so you don't have to--

49:54.366 --> 49:56.451
You don't have to worry about that.
We're good.

49:58.495 --> 50:04.042
Listen, you-- you don't have to know
every little detail about someone

50:04.126 --> 50:07.629
as long as you already know their heart.

50:09.047 --> 50:10.048
Right.

50:11.049 --> 50:12.050
Right.

50:29.109 --> 50:30.610
Couldn't save the world.

50:34.031 --> 50:36.950
Didn't even realize
that my client of five years

50:37.034 --> 50:39.077
didn't wanna become God.

50:40.287 --> 50:42.414
The world's greatest therapist, my ass.

50:42.497 --> 50:47.919
-More like "World's Biggest Fraud."
-Doctor, sit down.

50:50.005 --> 50:53.508
Now, you may not have helped me
ascend the throne of Heaven,

50:54.009 --> 50:55.177
but you did help.

50:57.012 --> 50:58.472
-Really?
-Yes.

50:59.765 --> 51:04.269
You have helped me
learn to put others first.

51:05.645 --> 51:09.066
You helped me repair relationships
that had been broken for…

51:09.649 --> 51:11.818
…well, millennia.

51:13.195 --> 51:17.240
You've helped me truly connect
with the love of my life.

51:19.993 --> 51:22.079
Dr. Linda Martin,

51:23.830 --> 51:27.042
"P-h-y" and all those things.

51:27.626 --> 51:29.252
In our time together,

51:29.336 --> 51:32.839
you managed to do something not even
God Almighty was able to accomplish.

51:35.050 --> 51:36.802
You've made me a better man.

51:44.142 --> 51:45.769
Thank you, Lucifer.

51:48.897 --> 51:51.983
That's the best compliment
a therapist could receive.

52:01.243 --> 52:03.829
-Mmm.

52:05.372 --> 52:06.498
Doctor.

52:07.666 --> 52:11.419
-Doctor!
-Sorry. Whoa. Sorr--

52:13.630 --> 52:16.883
-It's just been the longest day ever.
-Hasn't it?

52:16.967 --> 52:18.343
So, if you'll excuse me,

52:18.426 --> 52:22.556
I have a very important appointment
with a warm, soft bed.

52:23.640 --> 52:24.933
A well-earned rest.

53:18.862 --> 53:20.780
I know why the world is ending.

53:22.115 --> 53:23.408
We need to talk.

53:25.535 --> 53:27.621
Bollocks.
