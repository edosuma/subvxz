WEBVTT

00:02.252 --> 00:05.870
It was a final gamble.

00:05.964 --> 00:11.925
Gohan, having become a Great Ape,
struck one last blow for good measure.

00:13.222 --> 00:20.845
As Vegeta was trying to withdraw,
a fateful moment arrived.

00:20.938 --> 00:23.975
Th-This is for everyone you've killed!

00:24.066 --> 00:25.727
Say your prayers!

00:27.986 --> 00:30.898
Dokkan Dokkan We're in luck

00:30.989 --> 00:34.072
Dokkan Dokkan Paradise

00:34.159 --> 00:38.198
The Genki Dama bursts away

00:38.288 --> 00:41.621
Go Go Let's do it

00:42.835 --> 00:48.626
There's a wriggling, mysterious energy

00:48.716 --> 00:54.586
I won't hold back, just you watch

00:54.680 --> 01:00.550
I'll protect you with my life

01:00.644 --> 01:06.731
Turn your courage to love into strength

01:06.817 --> 01:12.733
We'll overcome crises with carry-through spirit

01:12.823 --> 01:19.991
The tougher your opponent is,
the greater the excitement

01:21.331 --> 01:24.198
Dokkan Dokkan We're in luck

01:24.293 --> 01:27.501
Dokkan Dokkan Now's our chance

01:27.588 --> 01:33.128
Whooshing along on the lucky wind

01:33.218 --> 01:36.085
Dokkan Dokkan We're in luck

01:36.180 --> 01:39.343
Dokkan Dokkan Tomorrow, as well

01:39.433 --> 01:46.475
Your souI already knows the answer

01:46.565 --> 01:50.183
Dragon Soul!

01:52.821 --> 01:59.363
"Dawn ofa Fierce Battle... The Star
of Hope is Piccolo 's Homeland. "

02:02.206 --> 02:05.573
You've outdone yourselves to come this far.

02:05.667 --> 02:07.919
I wasn't sure how this would turn out.

02:08.002 --> 02:10.961
I'm not supposed to take sides,

02:11.048 --> 02:13.334
but that Saiyan was a villain

02:13.425 --> 02:15.586
who plunged the whole universe into terror.

02:15.677 --> 02:18.714
I couldn't help it.

02:18.806 --> 02:20.671
This doesn't mean that the root of this evil

02:20.766 --> 02:23.633
has been completely eliminated, though.

02:23.727 --> 02:26.013
Not the root of it.

02:27.397 --> 02:30.889
Diell

02:30.984 --> 02:34.226
Wait!

02:34.321 --> 02:36.186
G-Goku?

02:36.281 --> 02:43.403
W-Was that you who just
spoke inside my mind, Goku?

02:43.497 --> 02:48.036
Yeah, that's right. I can't talk very loud, after all.

02:48.126 --> 02:54.292
K-Kuririn, forgive me for asking,
but would you let him live?

02:54.383 --> 02:58.547
A-Are you out of your mind, Goku?
This guy killed our friends,

02:58.637 --> 03:02.050
and was going to kill everyone in the world!

03:02.140 --> 03:05.598
If we let him go now,
he's sure to recover his strength,

03:05.686 --> 03:07.267
and then come back here!

03:07.354 --> 03:09.970
Y-You're probably right.

03:10.065 --> 03:14.980
If you're thinking that maybe
he'll have a change of heart,

03:15.070 --> 03:19.234
the way Piccolo did,
then you're greatly mistaken!

03:19.324 --> 03:21.315
He's not like that!

03:21.410 --> 03:28.703
|-| know. I know how ridiculously
strong that Vegeta guy is, too.

03:28.792 --> 03:32.125
Still, although I ain't able to explain it too well,

03:32.212 --> 03:38.629
s-seeing him there,
about to die, made me think...

03:38.719 --> 03:42.052
"What a waste. "

03:42.139 --> 03:44.926
W-What a waste?

03:45.017 --> 03:48.180
A-After training at Kaio-sama's place,

03:48.270 --> 03:51.933
lthought I had reached my peak.

03:52.024 --> 03:59.567
B-But that Vegeta guy there
had far surpassed me.

03:59.656 --> 04:04.366
It surprised me. To be honest,
I was overwhelmed.

04:04.453 --> 04:10.414
But then, somewhere in my heart,
I was happy and excited.

04:10.500 --> 04:13.913
Must be because I'm a Saiyan, too.

04:14.004 --> 04:17.791
Whenever I see anyone strong, my heart leaps.

04:20.260 --> 04:24.094
I know this is wrong, but please...

04:24.181 --> 04:29.426
...give me another chance to fight him.

04:31.000 --> 04:37.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:50.207 --> 04:55.201
All right. You do have the right
to ask for your own way.

04:55.295 --> 04:58.583
It's because of you, Goku, that we
still have the Earth that we do.

04:58.674 --> 05:01.006
But you listen to me, Goku!

05:01.093 --> 05:04.802
You take care of him next time
with devastating power!

05:04.888 --> 05:07.254
Yeah... I'll be sure to...

05:09.476 --> 05:12.263
Remember this well, you trash.

05:12.354 --> 05:15.016
There won't be any more miracles.

05:15.107 --> 05:17.769
The next time we meet, I'll kill you all...

05:17.859 --> 05:21.067
You can look forward to that.

05:41.758 --> 05:44.090
Damn it...

06:05.282 --> 06:06.647
Are you okay?

06:06.742 --> 06:09.609
You can rest easy, now.

06:12.372 --> 06:15.614
He left, eh?

06:15.709 --> 06:18.416
I gotta wonder, why didn't that peabrain...

06:18.503 --> 06:23.338
...finish the guy off?

06:23.425 --> 06:27.168
Sorry about that, Kuririn.

06:27.262 --> 06:28.718
Don't worry about it.

06:28.805 --> 06:31.421
It didn't seem right doing
that to everyone who died,

06:31.516 --> 06:35.429
but then again, it just might be
possible to bring them back to--

06:37.481 --> 06:39.847
H-He couldn't be...!

06:45.072 --> 06:51.068
Hey! Hey!

06:58.418 --> 07:01.080
Gohan-chan!

07:01.171 --> 07:03.583
Ch-Chichi?

07:03.673 --> 07:07.086
Gohan-chan! Gohan-chan!

07:07.177 --> 07:09.293
Gohan-chan!

07:10.347 --> 07:12.429
Ch-Chichi...

07:14.643 --> 07:17.680
Gohan-chan!

07:21.691 --> 07:23.898
Huh...?

07:23.985 --> 07:27.773
Gohan-chan! Gohan-chan! Are you okay?

07:27.864 --> 07:31.106
Wake up! Your ma is here!

07:31.201 --> 07:35.160
Gohan-chan! What an awful
mess you've been through!

07:35.247 --> 07:37.659
G-Gohan is fine.

07:37.749 --> 07:44.837
Goku is in far worse shape than he is.
You see? You see? Over there.

07:44.923 --> 07:48.711
You poor thing, bein' forced to go through this!

07:48.802 --> 07:51.635
You're never leavin' your ma's side again!

07:51.721 --> 07:57.182
You poor thing! Gohan-chan! Gohan-chan!

07:57.269 --> 08:00.636
That's just not right.
Goku had a rough time of it, too.

08:00.730 --> 08:02.345
S-Son-kun...

08:02.440 --> 08:06.024
--Goku...
--Son-kun...

08:06.111 --> 08:07.942
Are you okay, Son-kun?

08:08.029 --> 08:10.611
T-This is brutal.

08:10.699 --> 08:14.658
S-Sorry, I let the Saiyan get away.

08:14.744 --> 08:19.033
Oh, no, just being able to drive
him off is quite an accomplishment.

08:19.124 --> 08:21.115
Karin-sama...

08:21.209 --> 08:25.122
C-Calling him strong doesn't begin to cover it.

08:25.213 --> 08:29.707
B-Bulma-san... Yamucha-san
and everyone else besides us four

08:29.801 --> 08:31.507
were killed...

08:31.595 --> 08:33.802
Mm-hmm, we were watching it on TV.

08:33.889 --> 08:37.006
B-But with Piccolo dead, Kami-sama is also...

08:37.100 --> 08:41.639
That's right. Which means,
the Dragon Balls, as well...

08:43.481 --> 08:46.314
I know that much!

08:49.613 --> 08:51.945
You knew, didn't you?

08:52.032 --> 08:54.899
Y-Yeah.

08:54.993 --> 08:58.861
If only Piccolo were one
of the ones who survived...

08:58.955 --> 09:01.207
Well, excuse me fer livin'.

09:03.543 --> 09:09.038
That's right! All you did was run
around! You didn't fight one bit!

09:10.926 --> 09:13.087
W-What was that, ya big--

09:13.178 --> 09:16.295
A good-for-nothing jerk like you
ought to just die right now,

09:16.389 --> 09:19.973
and take Piccolo's place, you idiot!!

09:28.818 --> 09:33.027
If it wasn't fer me, these guys
wouldn'a survived, neither!

09:33.114 --> 09:35.856
Yer really burnin' me up!
No more Mr. Nice Guy fer me!

09:35.951 --> 09:37.282
All right, all right!

09:37.369 --> 09:40.486
Forget about that, we have to hurry
and get the injured to a hospital.

09:40.580 --> 09:43.413
I don't have any more senzu beans left.

09:45.418 --> 09:48.785
Easy, easy... easy, now...

10:22.998 --> 10:24.784
Gohan-chan...

10:28.420 --> 10:31.912
The others' bodies are around here, right?

10:32.007 --> 10:35.170
Um... a little farther that way.

10:41.308 --> 10:48.225
Bulma-san, don't cry. T-The chances
of this might be extremely slim...

10:48.315 --> 10:51.682
...and maybe a little bit ridiculous...

10:51.776 --> 10:53.607
...so listen, but don't get your hopes up.

10:53.695 --> 10:57.688
There is a chance that those
who were killed by the Saiyans

10:57.782 --> 11:00.740
can be brought back to life again.

11:02.620 --> 11:04.235
W-What do you mean?

11:04.331 --> 11:05.992
ReaHy?

11:06.082 --> 11:08.539
It's kind of a nebulous idea...

11:08.626 --> 11:11.038
K-Kuririn, now that you mention it,

11:11.129 --> 11:13.916
you said something about that to me, too.

11:14.007 --> 11:17.966
What do you mean by it? Tell us.

11:18.053 --> 11:20.669
T-The truth is...

11:20.764 --> 11:23.301
H-Hold on a minute. I'll tell you later.

11:23.391 --> 11:25.552
Muten Roshi-sama, land here.

11:25.643 --> 11:27.634
We have to get everyone's bodies aboard.

11:27.729 --> 11:29.265
Mm-hmm.

11:46.122 --> 11:51.492
That just leaves Chaozu's body... Let's see...

11:51.586 --> 11:53.372
T-There isn't one.

11:53.463 --> 11:56.296
He blew himself up, into little pieces.

11:56.383 --> 12:00.376
Good grief, how awful.

12:00.470 --> 12:05.260
I really do wish we could
bring them all back to life.

12:05.350 --> 12:09.935
The way things stand, their
sacrifice has been too great.

12:10.021 --> 12:13.605
Karin-sama, all | feel is anger...

12:13.691 --> 12:16.398
...over my own powerlessness.

12:22.659 --> 12:26.902
--Now, then...
--|t's okay. |'|| pilot.

12:28.623 --> 12:30.614
I've settled down a little.

12:30.708 --> 12:32.790
O-Okay.

12:37.757 --> 12:40.590
Gohan-chan, are you awake?!

12:42.262 --> 12:46.471
Relax! It's Ma! It's your ma!

12:46.558 --> 12:49.800
M-Mother?

12:49.894 --> 12:53.227
You poor thing! What a terrifyin' ordeal!

12:53.314 --> 12:55.020
But you're all right now!

12:55.108 --> 12:58.225
Yes, well done. Outstanding!

12:58.319 --> 12:59.479
We made it through!

12:59.571 --> 13:02.813
How? Where's the Saiyan?

13:02.907 --> 13:07.446
He ran away. He got away from us.

13:07.537 --> 13:12.031
B-But then, we all gave him
a real thrashing, right?

13:12.125 --> 13:15.117
He might not ever come back.

13:17.630 --> 13:18.790
Where's Father?!

13:18.882 --> 13:21.419
I'm in the back, Gohan.

13:21.509 --> 13:25.969
I somehow managed to survive,
thanks to you guys.

13:30.393 --> 13:32.600
Hey, that's all fine an' all...

13:32.687 --> 13:37.477
...but yer Goku's wife, right?
Ouit just worryin' 'bout the kid,

13:37.567 --> 13:40.229
an' start lookin' after yer husband some.

13:40.320 --> 13:43.153
H-How rude! No way!

13:43.239 --> 13:46.106
It's because of Goku-sa that
Gohan-chan suffered so!

13:46.201 --> 13:48.613
There was no reason to drag my boy into this!

13:48.703 --> 13:51.160
That's not true, Mother. Father was--

13:51.247 --> 13:53.363
I am far more worried about Gohan-chan's future

13:53.458 --> 13:56.996
than lam worried about the Earth!

13:58.838 --> 14:01.545
Goku, is it okay if I slug her?

14:01.633 --> 14:05.922
Kuririn, would you tell us
about what you meant earlier?

14:06.012 --> 14:09.721
O-Oh, right. Mm-hmm.

14:09.807 --> 14:14.392
The Saiyans seemed to know that
there were Dragon Balls here on Earth,

14:14.479 --> 14:18.313
probably through Goku's brother's radio.

14:18.399 --> 14:20.060
They also knew they granted wishes.

14:20.151 --> 14:22.062
So, as long as they were here,

14:22.153 --> 14:24.690
they were going to obtain the Dragon Balls, too.

14:24.781 --> 14:26.487
--Really?
--Yeah.

14:26.574 --> 14:31.113
But when they saw Piccolo's face,
they said something strange--

14:31.204 --> 14:33.490
that he was a "Namekian."

14:35.291 --> 14:40.911
Apparently, Piccolo was an alien.
And Kami-sama, too, I guess.

14:41.005 --> 14:44.213
That ain't so surprisin', given his face.

14:44.300 --> 14:47.133
The critical thing is what came next.

14:48.179 --> 14:50.340
Nappa! Kill them!

14:50.431 --> 14:53.047
B-But what about the Dragon Balls?

14:53.142 --> 14:55.804
No matter! I have an idea!

14:55.895 --> 14:58.978
If we go to that Namekian's
home world of Planet Namek,

14:59.065 --> 15:03.809
they're sure to have even more
powerful Dragon Balls there!

15:03.903 --> 15:06.770
Feh, that's what they said? Big whoop.

15:06.864 --> 15:08.365
I heard them, too!

15:08.449 --> 15:13.113
They said the Namekians had the
power to create mysterious balls.

15:13.204 --> 15:16.071
lf-- and that's a really big if--

15:16.165 --> 15:19.328
we were able to go to this Planet Namek,

15:19.419 --> 15:21.785
we might be able to get our
hands on those Dragon Balls.

15:21.879 --> 15:23.085
| get it.

15:23.172 --> 15:27.256
If you did that, those who were
killed could come back to life!

15:27.343 --> 15:28.958
Piccolo-san could come back to life!

15:29.053 --> 15:31.305
G-Gohan-chan! How can you say that?!

15:31.389 --> 15:34.973
Exactly! If Piccolo came back
to life, so would Kami-sama!

15:35.059 --> 15:38.551
Which would also mean the
Dragon Balls here could come back!

15:39.606 --> 15:45.192
--Banzai! Banzai! Banzai!...
--T-That's amazing! T-Then maybe,
possibly, this could work!

15:45.278 --> 15:47.735
Couldn't it? Couldn't it? Couldn't it?

15:50.408 --> 15:53.275
Things are so simple to you laymen, huh?

15:53.369 --> 15:56.486
There's no way we could
achieve such a pipe dream.

15:56.581 --> 15:58.162
What a bummer.

15:58.249 --> 16:00.956
Not even you can do it, Bulma-san?

16:01.044 --> 16:03.911
For one thing, Kuririn,
how are we going to find out

16:04.005 --> 16:07.793
where this whatever-it's-called planet is?

16:07.884 --> 16:10.125
L-Leave that to me.

16:10.219 --> 16:12.551
Kaio-sama, you heard, right?

16:12.639 --> 16:16.848
Do you know where this Planet Namek is?

16:16.934 --> 16:20.677
Planet Namek? Of course I know where it is.

16:20.772 --> 16:24.606
Whatever else anyone says, I am Kaio, after all.

16:24.692 --> 16:28.059
T-This is incredible! We can all hear him, too!

16:28.154 --> 16:30.770
S-So this is Kaio-sama, is it?

16:30.865 --> 16:33.652
Kaio-sama, it sounds like
everyone else can hear you, too.

16:33.743 --> 16:35.449
Tell us where it is.

16:35.536 --> 16:38.528
Hmm, Planet Namek's location...

16:38.623 --> 16:42.866
The way you folks on Earth
would put it... let's see...

16:42.960 --> 16:48.125
Bearing SW66 by... no, er...

16:48.216 --> 16:51.674
...let's see here... bearing SU83...

16:51.761 --> 16:56.095
...by, let's see, 9045YX, is it?

16:56.182 --> 16:59.720
9... 9045YX, you say?!

16:59.811 --> 17:03.224
B-Bulma-san, did you understand that just now?

17:03.314 --> 17:06.897
H-Hey, Kame-chan, take over.
I have to calculate something.

17:06.983 --> 17:09.111
K-Kame-chan?

17:09.194 --> 17:14.440
The thing is, Planet Namek was
once an extremely beautiful world,

17:14.534 --> 17:15.990
but as I recall, a good while back,

17:16.077 --> 17:17.988
they had an awful climatic aberration,

17:18.079 --> 17:21.788
and I thought that all of the Namekians died out.

17:21.874 --> 17:25.537
Then that does it. Ain't no way
there's any Dragon Balls.

17:25.627 --> 17:26.992
H-Hey, you!

17:27.088 --> 17:32.424
Now, don't panic. Once I check up
on Planet Namek, I'll know for sure.

17:32.510 --> 17:36.298
Where was it, again? Let's see now...

17:39.809 --> 17:41.424
Oh, this way?

17:47.358 --> 17:49.735
escaped there and came to Earth.

17:49.819 --> 17:52.526
The fact that Kami himself forgot about it

17:52.613 --> 17:54.114
means that he either lost his memory,

17:54.198 --> 17:57.031
or that he was just a little child at the time.

17:57.118 --> 17:58.858
Either way, he had a sad past.

17:58.953 --> 18:04.744
Even so, the Dragon Balls
can grant any wish, right?

18:04.834 --> 18:06.995
So the guys that made 'em coulda just said,

18:07.086 --> 18:10.499
"Stop this abnormal climate, " couldn't they?

18:10.590 --> 18:12.330
That probably wouldn't have worked.

18:12.425 --> 18:15.713
Shen Long said that he couldn't grant any wish

18:15.803 --> 18:20.263
that was greater than the power of
the one who created the Dragon Balls.

18:20.349 --> 18:23.386
That means he couldn't
rein in such terrific power.

18:23.478 --> 18:27.687
That's why even Shen Long couldn't
do anything about the Saiyans.

18:27.774 --> 18:32.814
Oh, ya don't say. The Dragon Balls
ain't all that great, then.

18:37.617 --> 18:39.278
Oh, there they are!

18:39.368 --> 18:42.405
There are Namekians! There are
no more than a hundred of them,

18:42.497 --> 18:44.954
but they survived, and are flourishing again!

18:46.000 --> 18:49.834
There're a hundred of them guys?!

18:54.467 --> 19:01.259
Not to worry. By nature,
Namekians are a very gentle race.

19:01.349 --> 19:06.434
Just like the guy that used
to be Kami on your planet.

19:06.521 --> 19:09.854
What became Piccolo Daimao
was probably brought about

19:09.941 --> 19:14.025
by the influence of the evil
in earthlings he encountered

19:14.111 --> 19:17.603
before he became Kami.

19:21.077 --> 19:22.863
Yeah, that tracks.

19:22.954 --> 19:26.697
There're some pretty small-minded
folks out there in the world.

19:26.791 --> 19:27.746
Look who's talking.

19:27.834 --> 19:30.041
Still, this means there's a chance that Kami,

19:30.127 --> 19:33.460
not to mention Yamucha and
Tenshinhan, can come back to life!

19:33.548 --> 19:36.836
--Uh-huh! Uh-huh!
--Naive! You guys are so naive!

19:36.926 --> 19:40.384
Sure, we may know where this
Planet Namek place is. However,

19:40.471 --> 19:42.086
how are you thinking of getting there?

19:42.181 --> 19:45.673
How? Well, in a spaceship, of course.

19:45.768 --> 19:49.010
And I'm telling you, that's where
you're being downright naive!

19:49.105 --> 19:51.187
| just calculated the time it
would take for a spaceship,

19:51.274 --> 19:53.856
using the world's best engine, built by my dad,

19:53.943 --> 19:56.935
to arrive at Planet Namek, just to see what it was.

19:57.029 --> 20:01.272
A real Whopper of a number came back. See?

20:01.367 --> 20:07.533
4,339 years and three months.
We'll have to live an awfully long time.

20:09.542 --> 20:12.875
As far as that goes, I think we'll be all right.

20:12.962 --> 20:16.875
l was thinking of using the
spaceship that Saiyan came in.

20:16.966 --> 20:19.082
I got a look at Vegeta's spaceship,

20:19.176 --> 20:22.418
and it was so small, any way
you look at it, it's a one-seater.

20:22.513 --> 20:25.175
Which means that the other,
dead Saiyan's spaceship

20:25.266 --> 20:26.802
has to still be out there somewhere.

20:26.893 --> 20:31.353
Y-Yeah! The spaceship my
older brother rode here in, too!

20:31.439 --> 20:35.773
Ah, come to think of it, that one
got smashed up by Gohan.

20:35.860 --> 20:38.442
Even so, there's still one of them, right?

20:38.529 --> 20:39.905
Once I find that one and analyze it,

20:39.989 --> 20:41.775
I might be able to manage something.

20:41.866 --> 20:44.448
It's probably somewhere around Metro East.

20:44.535 --> 20:47.242
That was the first area destroyed by the Saiyans.

20:47.330 --> 20:50.322
We'll have to go look for it later.

20:50.416 --> 20:53.533
That's what I was thinking,
and picked up a neat little item.

20:53.628 --> 20:57.496
This. I know I saw Vegeta beep this

20:57.590 --> 21:01.924
and call his spaceship in.
I'm sure it's a remote control!

21:06.766 --> 21:09.849
This could work! This could really work!

21:11.228 --> 21:15.096
All right! All right! Hope is in sight!

21:16.609 --> 21:19.396
Planet Namek or bust!

21:19.487 --> 21:22.524
Yeah, right!

21:22.615 --> 21:26.233
The target world has been set.
However, before they can leave,

21:31.916 --> 21:34.828
Yeah! Break! Care! Break! As hard as you can

21:34.919 --> 21:39.413
Fly away into the boundless skies

21:39.507 --> 21:42.340
We'll hitch a ride on the jet stream,

21:42.426 --> 21:45.463
and zip away to wherever we want

21:45.554 --> 21:47.806
Being a daredevil is the best

21:47.890 --> 21:51.223
Let's go tip-top! All right?

21:51.310 --> 21:57.101
This eye-opening blue Earth of ours

21:57.191 --> 22:03.278
is our irreplaceable world,
and we're not giving it up

22:04.657 --> 22:07.615
Blast offa Kamehame-Ha

22:07.702 --> 22:10.865
You were born

22:10.955 --> 22:16.575
to protect the world in these uncertain times

22:16.669 --> 22:19.581
Yeah! Break! Care! Break! As hard as you can

22:19.672 --> 22:22.789
Go at it full power

22:22.883 --> 22:26.842
Hope is my weapon,

22:26.929 --> 22:30.171
so believe in the future

22:34.520 --> 22:36.431
Hello. I'm Gohan.

22:36.522 --> 22:39.639
Whoa, Bulma-san! The spaceship
was blown to smithereens!

22:39.734 --> 22:42.897
That doesn't matter! You've got
cram school, piano lessons,

22:42.987 --> 22:44.568
calligraphy, abacus lessons, English class--

22:44.655 --> 22:47.897
Shut up! Right now isn't
the time to talk about that!

22:47.992 --> 22:50.699
G-G-Gohan-chan has turned into a delinquent!

22:50.786 --> 22:52.572
Next time on Dragon Ball Z Kai,

22:52.663 --> 22:56.747
"The Ship Resting in Yunzabit!
Time to Blast Off for Planet Namek"

22:56.834 --> 23:00.292
I wanna go see the original Shen Long, too!
