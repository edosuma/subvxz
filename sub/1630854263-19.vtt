WEBVTT

00:05.870 --> 00:07.650
Malcolm, is this
toaster working?

00:07.850 --> 00:09.660
Yeah, but it's a hand-me-down,

00:09.860 --> 00:11.490
so it's going
to take a minute to warm up.

00:11.690 --> 00:13.030
Warm up?
Yeah.

00:13.230 --> 00:14.560
It's got one job.
(laughs)

00:14.760 --> 00:17.800
I got to get going.
No, no, no, no, come on.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.530
Let's, uh, stay and hang out
for a little bit.

00:20.730 --> 00:22.240
I don't want this
to end so soon.

00:22.440 --> 00:24.940
Neither do I, but I have
a million things to do.

00:25.140 --> 00:27.840
Okay, well, how about you wait
until your toast...

00:28.040 --> 00:29.880
is ready?

00:30.080 --> 00:32.580
(both laugh)

00:32.780 --> 00:34.250
Oh. Yeah, I see
what you're doing.
Yeah.

00:34.450 --> 00:36.850
But I got to go.
Oh. Okay, okay.

00:37.050 --> 00:39.740
Well, let me go put a shirt on,
then I'll walk you out.

00:42.270 --> 00:43.290
Marty.

00:43.490 --> 00:44.790
Marty, you ready to go?

00:44.990 --> 00:46.190
Oh. I'm sorry.

00:46.390 --> 00:48.190
Hello.
Hi.

00:48.390 --> 00:50.300
Are you visiting
Malcolm or Marty?

00:50.500 --> 00:53.400
Who's Marty?
Well, that answers that.

00:53.600 --> 00:55.800
How you doing? I'm Calvin.
I'm Malcolm's dad.

00:56.000 --> 00:57.670
Oh.
Calvin, you forgot
your... coffee.

00:57.870 --> 01:00.170
Oh, hi. (laughs)
Malcolm or Marty?

01:00.370 --> 01:01.510
Malcolm.
Oh.

01:01.710 --> 01:04.510
Janelle.
Tina, Malcolm's mom.

01:04.710 --> 01:06.750
Oh, very nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

01:06.950 --> 01:08.150
Hey-hey! Oh, no.

01:08.350 --> 01:09.480
Oh, yes.

01:09.680 --> 01:12.220
Uh, hey, Mama,
Daddy, this is, uh...

01:12.420 --> 01:14.450
BOTH: Janelle.
Yeah.

01:14.650 --> 01:17.290
What is all
of this commotion? Oh! Oh.

01:17.490 --> 01:21.030
Oh. (laughs)

01:21.230 --> 01:22.930
So, let me guess. Marty?

01:23.130 --> 01:24.200
Oh! So I came up?

01:24.400 --> 01:26.730
And then, who is this
lovely young lady?

01:26.930 --> 01:28.930
CALVIN/MALCOLM:
Janelle.

01:29.130 --> 01:30.470
Marty, why don't you
put some shoes on?

01:30.670 --> 01:31.800
I got a warehouse
I want to show you.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.540
Yeah.
We're starting
a new business--

01:33.740 --> 01:34.640
Butler and Son.

01:34.840 --> 01:36.080
Oh.
Come on, Tina.

01:36.280 --> 01:39.600
We should go, baby.
Oh, I don't have anywhere to be.

01:40.800 --> 01:42.580
So, when did you two meet?

01:42.780 --> 01:44.450
It was fairly recent.
Yesterday.

01:44.650 --> 01:47.470
Oh. How nice.

01:48.600 --> 01:51.370
Eyebrows down, Tina.

01:53.010 --> 01:55.290
You know what?
I should probably run

01:55.490 --> 01:56.660
before I start
meeting your cousins.

01:56.860 --> 01:58.460
(laughs)
Um, how about

01:58.660 --> 02:00.300
we just go grab some breakfast?

02:00.500 --> 02:02.270
I just got to put my shoes on.
Uh...

02:02.470 --> 02:04.700
Emergency!
Hair emergency!
What?

02:04.900 --> 02:06.770
Whoa, whoa, Grover doesn't
have lice again, does he?

02:06.970 --> 02:09.280
No. Tonight's the banquet
at the school,

02:09.480 --> 02:11.110
and my stylist just
went into labor.

02:11.310 --> 02:13.810
Oh, no, not today.
I know.

02:14.010 --> 02:15.810
I asked her how far apart
her contractions were--

02:16.010 --> 02:19.700
maybe she could just squeeze me
in-- but she got very salty.

02:20.570 --> 02:23.160
Oh, hi. I'm Gemma.

02:23.360 --> 02:25.520
Janelle.
Oh.

02:25.720 --> 02:27.330
Malcolm.
Mm-hmm.

02:27.530 --> 02:29.530
Yes, this is his new friend.

02:29.730 --> 02:31.660
His <i>very</i> new friend,

02:31.860 --> 02:33.470
if you know what
I'm saying. Ha.

02:33.670 --> 02:36.600
Ooh, eyebrows, babe.

02:36.800 --> 02:38.700
I'm sorry to bust in here
freaking out.

02:38.900 --> 02:40.940
It's just
I'm getting an award tonight.

02:41.140 --> 02:43.510
Well, congratulations. I'm just
trying to get to my bag.
Oh.

02:43.710 --> 02:44.840
Ooh, hey, Gemma,
I've been looking

02:45.040 --> 02:46.450
all over for you.
Grover's late

02:46.650 --> 02:47.880
for basketball, and he can't
find one of his shoes.

02:48.080 --> 02:49.420
Well, I don't know
where it is, Dave.

02:49.620 --> 02:50.900
You're holding it.

02:51.730 --> 02:54.220
Sorry. I was panicking.

02:54.420 --> 02:55.950
Oh, hey, I'm Dave.

02:56.150 --> 02:58.820
Hey, is that your convertible
outside? It is so cool.

02:59.020 --> 03:01.460
I was checking it out
all last night, and...

03:01.660 --> 03:04.260
and it's still here
this morning.
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

03:04.460 --> 03:06.000
Nice.
Yeah.

03:06.200 --> 03:07.700
Dave!
Okay, uh, yes.

03:07.900 --> 03:09.340
Uh, excuse me.
Yup. Thank...

03:09.540 --> 03:11.570
Oh. Oh.
Yup. Thank you.

03:11.770 --> 03:13.940
Uh, it was really nice
to meet you all.
Yeah, yeah.

03:14.140 --> 03:15.470
GEMMA:
Nice to meet you.
You're very pretty.

03:15.670 --> 03:18.580
(overlapping chatter)

03:18.780 --> 03:21.310
Of course
she drives a convertible.

03:21.510 --> 03:23.850
What does that even mean, Ma?

03:24.050 --> 03:27.470
I don't know.
It just... it seems loose.

03:28.700 --> 03:30.720
Okay, Janelle? Uh,

03:30.920 --> 03:33.290
where'd she go?
Uh, she drove off.

03:33.490 --> 03:35.010
She probably had her top down.

03:37.010 --> 03:39.180
What?! I'm talking
about the car.

03:40.980 --> 03:42.800
* Welcome to the block,
welcome to the neighborhood *

03:43.000 --> 03:44.550
* Welcome to the hood. *

03:49.930 --> 03:51.110
Oh, thank you.

03:51.310 --> 03:52.980
Gemma, you owe me big-time.

03:53.180 --> 03:54.750
That was my stylist, Zenay,

03:54.950 --> 03:56.850
and she's going to be able
to fit you in today.

03:57.050 --> 03:58.820
Oh, you are a lifesaver!
(laughs)

03:59.020 --> 04:01.050
Well, be prepared
to wait.

04:01.250 --> 04:03.320
The first time
Tina went to Zenay,

04:03.520 --> 04:06.390
she was gone so long,
I thought she had left me.

04:06.590 --> 04:07.630
Baby...

04:07.830 --> 04:08.860
Hey, hey.

04:09.060 --> 04:10.560
Well, look who's finally ready.

04:10.760 --> 04:14.200
I'm sorry. I was hungry,
and our toaster takes forever.

04:14.400 --> 04:17.490
I told you to plug it in
the night before.

04:19.090 --> 04:20.610
Ooh. Hey, guys.

04:20.810 --> 04:22.680
Hey, thanks again
for inviting me to come along.

04:22.880 --> 04:24.840
You know, watching all
those home renovation shows

04:25.040 --> 04:26.280
is finally about to pay off.

04:26.480 --> 04:28.710
Look at this.
I got my tape measure,

04:28.910 --> 04:30.080
my stud finder.

04:30.280 --> 04:32.080
(beeping)
Ooh, look at that.

04:32.280 --> 04:33.800
Found one.

04:35.170 --> 04:36.820
He's been doing that
all morning.

04:37.020 --> 04:38.760
Hmm.
MALCOLM:
Well...

04:38.960 --> 04:40.790
(clears throat)
I am glad that you are all here,

04:40.990 --> 04:42.600
because I have a question,

04:42.800 --> 04:46.750
and, uh, I'm going to need you
to reserve your judgment.

04:48.080 --> 04:49.740
Now,

04:49.940 --> 04:52.470
the beautiful woman you all
met at my house today...

04:52.670 --> 04:54.710
Janelle. Yes.

04:54.910 --> 04:57.160
Eyebrows, babe.

04:59.030 --> 05:01.580
So-- and this is
kind of funny,

05:01.780 --> 05:03.580
'cause it could happen
to anybody but, uh--

05:03.780 --> 05:05.880
I did not happen
to catch her last name.

05:06.080 --> 05:07.600
Did any of y'all get it?

05:10.870 --> 05:13.160
Wow.
Okay.

05:13.360 --> 05:16.030
Okay, Ma, Ma,
it is not like that.

05:16.230 --> 05:17.430
No, no, no, we met
at a bookstore

05:17.630 --> 05:18.900
and made
a real connection.

05:19.100 --> 05:20.830
We both picked up
the same Colson Whitehead book

05:21.030 --> 05:22.440
at the same time.

05:22.640 --> 05:25.070
Ended up in the greatest
conversation. She's a writer.

05:25.270 --> 05:27.460
Well, maybe you should have
had her write her name down.

05:29.790 --> 05:32.410
Well, Dave,
thanks to y'all barging

05:32.610 --> 05:34.310
into my place
and freaking her out,

05:34.510 --> 05:36.880
she took off before I can get
her last name or her number.

05:37.080 --> 05:39.790
I mean, Malcolm doing the nasty
with people you don't know

05:39.990 --> 05:41.390
and not knowing their last name?

05:41.590 --> 05:43.510
We raised you better than that.

05:44.210 --> 05:45.770
(chuckles)

05:47.780 --> 05:49.210
(laughs)

05:50.010 --> 05:54.670
Are you telling me you and
Calvin waited to... you know?

05:54.870 --> 05:55.870
Yes!

05:56.070 --> 05:57.100
(laughs, clears throat)

05:57.300 --> 05:59.540
Uh!

05:59.740 --> 06:02.910
Calvin, we did not
do it on the first date!

06:03.110 --> 06:05.140
No, no, that's right,
but that second date,

06:05.340 --> 06:07.880
I was just glad
I had tinted windows.

06:08.080 --> 06:10.230
(laughing):
You know?

06:11.200 --> 06:13.690
I did not need to hear that!

06:13.890 --> 06:15.490
The point is,

06:15.690 --> 06:17.890
it wasn't a one-night stand.

06:18.090 --> 06:19.530
He was my future husband.

06:19.730 --> 06:22.160
Yeah, but you didn't know that
at the time, Mama.

06:22.360 --> 06:23.910
You don't know what I knew.

06:26.010 --> 06:29.070
The thing is, I may
have found the one,

06:29.270 --> 06:30.870
and I lost her, okay?

06:31.070 --> 06:32.370
Man, I've got to find her,

06:32.570 --> 06:34.140
but the only evidence
I have she even exists

06:34.340 --> 06:36.190
is this sock.

06:37.230 --> 06:38.940
This is very romantic.

06:39.140 --> 06:41.610
It's like Cinderella, except
instead of a glass slipper,

06:41.810 --> 06:45.120
it's a tiny,
polka-dotted sock.

06:45.320 --> 06:47.920
No-show socks,

06:48.120 --> 06:49.290
ankles all out.
What?

06:49.490 --> 06:52.580
Uh-uh. Uh-uh-uh-uh.

06:59.680 --> 07:02.640
So, go through these magazines,
find a picture you like.

07:02.840 --> 07:04.240
I'll hook you up.
I'm thinking

07:04.440 --> 07:06.040
something classic,

07:06.240 --> 07:07.410
sophisticated, pow!

07:07.610 --> 07:09.910
Oh, that's what
I'm thinking, too. Pow!

07:10.110 --> 07:11.380
(laughter)

07:11.580 --> 07:13.350
Well, my girl's got
to look good tonight.

07:13.550 --> 07:15.510
I'm getting an AWARE Award.

07:15.710 --> 07:16.850
Uh,

07:17.050 --> 07:19.750
Aware Women Advocating
for Racial Equality.

07:19.950 --> 07:22.970
Oh, so the "A"
in "AWARE" is for "aware"?

07:23.970 --> 07:25.820
Well, check you out.

07:26.020 --> 07:27.460
It's for everything
I've done at the school

07:27.660 --> 07:29.700
to foster inclusion
and encourage diversity.

07:29.900 --> 07:32.650
Oh, like hiring me.
Well, you're welcome.

07:34.180 --> 07:36.130
Okay, I got you, but first,
I got to rinse out Jackie,

07:36.330 --> 07:38.800
give Toni a relaxer, and sew in
some tracks for Alyssa.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.210
Then I...

07:40.410 --> 07:41.640
"got you" got you.

07:41.840 --> 07:43.530
(laughter)

07:47.360 --> 07:49.010
Hey, come on in, guys.

07:49.210 --> 07:51.880
You know, I'm really feeling
like this place might be

07:52.080 --> 07:53.820
the one. Yeah.

07:54.020 --> 07:55.590
Aah.
Ooh.

07:55.790 --> 07:58.520
All right,
turn the lights back off.

07:58.720 --> 08:00.930
Hey, Marty, come on, man.

08:01.130 --> 08:04.630
You got to give this place
a chance, all right?

08:04.830 --> 08:08.170
It's-it's in our price range,
and it's... it's got good bones.

08:08.370 --> 08:11.650
Yeah, literally, there are bones
in that corner over there.

08:14.860 --> 08:17.140
And after the DNA test,
Denise found out

08:17.340 --> 08:18.480
that she was adopted...
(gasps)

08:18.680 --> 08:20.010
...and her biological mother

08:20.210 --> 08:22.210
was her fiancé's mother.

08:22.410 --> 08:24.530
Oh, my God!

08:25.770 --> 08:28.420
So they're basically
brother and sister.

08:28.620 --> 08:29.390
Ain't no basically.

08:29.590 --> 08:31.390
Oh!
Mm!

08:31.590 --> 08:33.690
See, that's why I do not
fool with 23andMe.

08:33.890 --> 08:36.290
That DNA was minding
its own damn business.

08:36.490 --> 08:38.900
Well, I completely disagree.

08:39.100 --> 08:40.800
Now these people
can have a fresh start.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.970
Girl, please. I'm going to
her wedding shower Saturday.

08:43.170 --> 08:44.790
What?!

08:45.720 --> 08:47.840
Shut up! You have to stop her!

08:48.040 --> 08:49.270
Not my business.
Not her business.

08:49.470 --> 08:51.540
Oh, you two are terrible.

08:51.740 --> 08:53.810
I love it here.
(laughs)

08:54.010 --> 08:54.950
(timer dings)

08:55.150 --> 08:57.220
Oh, hey, that timer--
is that for me?

08:57.420 --> 08:59.520
Oh, I don't use timers, Mama.
That's the air fryer.

08:59.720 --> 09:01.740
That's my lunch.
Sit tight.
Oh.

09:02.500 --> 09:04.260
Hey.
Oh, Malcolm,
what are you doing here?

09:04.460 --> 09:06.630
Hey, Mama, I need to ask you
and Gemma something. Um...
Mm-hmm.

09:06.830 --> 09:08.490
This morning
when I was in my room,

09:08.690 --> 09:10.230
and you two were
talking to Janelle,

09:10.430 --> 09:12.630
did she happen to mention where
she works or where she lives,

09:12.830 --> 09:14.270
you know, anything
that might help me find her?

09:14.470 --> 09:17.370
Who's Janelle?
That's his new friend
he slept with,

09:17.570 --> 09:19.140
even though
he only knew her for an hour.

09:19.340 --> 09:21.040
(gasps)

09:21.240 --> 09:22.580
Okay. Okay.

09:22.780 --> 09:24.040
So you slept
with this woman,

09:24.240 --> 09:25.440
and you didn't know
the first thing about her?

09:25.640 --> 09:26.980
That's what
he should do.

09:27.180 --> 09:28.810
Why waste your time trying
to get to know someone?

09:29.010 --> 09:31.430
I'm not going to buy a car
unless I test-drive it first.

09:32.230 --> 09:33.820
Do you have a picture of her?
Maybe we know her.

09:34.020 --> 09:35.150
Uh, yes, I do.

09:35.350 --> 09:36.720
(laughs)
Oh, not that one.

09:36.920 --> 09:39.190
Oh, good Lord!
Okay.

09:39.390 --> 09:40.390
Okay, here's a good one.

09:40.590 --> 09:41.860
See? See?

09:42.060 --> 09:43.360
Oh, she cute.

09:43.560 --> 09:44.760
Yeah.
I'll tell you
one thing.

09:44.960 --> 09:46.700
She gets her hair done
at a Dominican shop.

09:46.900 --> 09:48.470
Mm-hmm. She got
that bouncy, blow-out style.

09:48.670 --> 09:50.370
Ah. Okay, great.
Mm-hmm.

09:50.570 --> 09:51.800
Dominican salons.
I'm on it.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.670
Ah, I got to go.
I got class at 6:00.

09:53.870 --> 09:55.140
Bye, Mama.
Bye, baby.

09:55.340 --> 09:56.540
Mm, mm.

09:56.740 --> 09:58.340
He don't need
to find no Dominican salon.

09:58.540 --> 10:00.630
I am right here.

10:02.200 --> 10:04.930
You heard him when he said
"Bye, <i>Mama,"</i> right?

10:08.640 --> 10:11.190
Marty, come on, man.

10:11.390 --> 10:12.860
You got to use your imagination

10:13.060 --> 10:14.990
to picture how dope
this place could be.

10:15.190 --> 10:18.130
You know, Calvin's right.
This is all cosmetic.

10:18.330 --> 10:20.530
Yeah, you watch
these renovation shows,

10:20.730 --> 10:22.130
you'd be amazed
what a fresh coat of paint,

10:22.330 --> 10:23.540
little shiplap can do.

10:23.740 --> 10:26.050
You know, maybe put out a bowl
of fresh lemons.

10:27.390 --> 10:28.470
Why?

10:28.670 --> 10:30.140
I don't know, Marty.

10:30.340 --> 10:32.030
It's just what they do.

10:33.660 --> 10:35.280
Okay, let me
ask you. Does...?

10:35.480 --> 10:36.780
Does this place
have the capacity

10:36.980 --> 10:38.780
for 6,000 amps
of electrical current?

10:38.980 --> 10:40.620
I don't know.
I didn't ask about that.

10:40.820 --> 10:43.060
But, you know,
you'll figure it out.

10:43.260 --> 10:44.360
You're smart.
Oh, Dad,

10:44.560 --> 10:45.820
it doesn't matter
how smart I am.

10:46.020 --> 10:47.460
There either is enough
electricity, or there isn't.

10:47.660 --> 10:50.530
Hmm. It smells like gas,
if that's something.

10:50.730 --> 10:52.600
CALVIN:
Okay, you know what?

10:52.800 --> 10:56.430
We'll figure out the electricity
thing because we have to.

10:56.630 --> 10:58.770
I already put a deposit
on this place.

10:58.970 --> 11:00.920
What?

11:01.760 --> 11:03.180
W-Without consulting me?

11:03.380 --> 11:05.980
Hey, man, this place is perfect.
I didn't want to lose it.

11:06.180 --> 11:07.910
Dad, we're supposed
to be partners,

11:08.110 --> 11:09.920
and you're making
all the decisions.

11:10.120 --> 11:14.320
All the money decisions because
I'm bringing all of the money.

11:14.520 --> 11:16.120
And I'm bringing
all the research,

11:16.320 --> 11:18.120
all the technical knowledge,
the coding skills,

11:18.320 --> 11:20.530
and not to mention
my engineering degree.

11:20.730 --> 11:22.190
And you know what?
If I'm being really real,

11:22.390 --> 11:24.400
the name shouldn't even be
"Butler and Son."

11:24.600 --> 11:27.580
It should be "Butler and Dad."

11:28.380 --> 11:30.040
(murmurs quietly)

11:30.240 --> 11:31.370
Okay.

11:31.570 --> 11:34.570
Hmm, hmm, hmm.
Ho, ho, ho!

11:34.770 --> 11:36.840
You're being real disrespectful
right now

11:37.040 --> 11:39.980
because it sounds like you're
saying I don't do anything.

11:40.180 --> 11:43.250
Yeah, well, I know how it
sounds, and I said what I said.

11:43.450 --> 11:44.620
Okay.

11:44.820 --> 11:46.150
You know what, son?
You might want

11:46.350 --> 11:48.090
to take some
of that bass out your voice.

11:48.290 --> 11:52.240
How about I take my whole
behind out of this warehouse?

11:55.180 --> 11:56.710
Marty...

11:57.880 --> 12:00.520
I thought there was drama
on <i>Love It or List It.</i>

12:08.060 --> 12:09.610
Ooh. All right,
Gemma, I am done.

12:09.810 --> 12:11.960
I will see you
at the thingy.
Oh.

12:12.730 --> 12:14.810
Is this normal?
I've been here three hours,

12:15.010 --> 12:16.380
and I still have conditioner in.

12:16.580 --> 12:18.220
You've got your conditioner in?

12:18.420 --> 12:20.400
Oh, she is moving today.

12:22.600 --> 12:24.660
It's just every time
she does something,

12:24.860 --> 12:29.580
she says, "It'll be a minute,"
but then it's much, much longer.

12:30.850 --> 12:33.400
Oh. See, you have to understand,

12:33.600 --> 12:36.330
when we say a minute,
it can mean any amount of time

12:36.530 --> 12:39.290
from an actual minute
to six months.

12:40.660 --> 12:42.640
But you're gonna
look good, though.

12:42.840 --> 12:44.240
When? (laughs)

12:44.440 --> 12:46.660
Like she said, in a minute.

12:53.200 --> 12:56.600
(Malcolm sighs)

12:57.870 --> 12:59.320
Hey,

12:59.520 --> 13:02.430
I know this is a long shot,
but, uh, you ever been

13:02.630 --> 13:04.230
to that bookstore
over on Adams?

13:04.430 --> 13:06.330
Yeah.
Yeah? Okay, well, listen.

13:06.530 --> 13:08.400
I am looking
for a woman I met there,

13:08.600 --> 13:10.750
and she wears socks like this.

13:13.890 --> 13:17.210
Listen, we made a real strong
connection, you know, and then,

13:17.410 --> 13:19.860
she just... she just got away.

13:21.560 --> 13:25.250
"Got away" is a bad choice
of words, okay? (laughs) I...

13:25.450 --> 13:28.390
I mean, she took off before
I had a chance to stop her.

13:28.590 --> 13:30.560
"Stop her" in a nice way,
'cause I'm not...

13:30.760 --> 13:33.310
Okay, I see.
That's fair. That's fair.

13:35.010 --> 13:35.990
Hello, everyone.

13:36.190 --> 13:37.600
Well, good God.

13:37.800 --> 13:40.700
Welcome to the Art of
the Short Story. I'm Dr. Finch.

13:40.900 --> 13:42.970
Good afternoon...

13:43.170 --> 13:44.470
Dr. Finch.

13:44.670 --> 13:46.500
Oh. Hi.

13:46.700 --> 13:47.740
Hi.

13:47.940 --> 13:49.320
From the bookstore.

13:50.630 --> 13:53.650
Anyway... the reading list
is challenging,

13:53.850 --> 13:56.260
but I'm sure
you all will enjoy it.

13:58.030 --> 14:00.600
I'm just Bookstore Guy now.

14:04.670 --> 14:08.930
Can you believe Marty wants
to call it "Butler and Dad"?

14:09.130 --> 14:11.730
I mean, would you ever speak
to your daddy like that?

14:11.930 --> 14:15.970
No. But remember, my dad was
a bum who left when I was 11.

14:16.170 --> 14:18.240
Um, right. My bad.

14:18.440 --> 14:20.710
However, I was very rude

14:20.910 --> 14:23.390
to my mom's
special friend Steve.

14:25.130 --> 14:27.250
I would never ask to be excused.

14:27.450 --> 14:29.380
I would just stand up,
clear all the dishes,

14:29.580 --> 14:31.630
and then...
then I would wash 'em.

14:33.700 --> 14:35.520
Tina?

14:35.720 --> 14:37.910
So, what do you think?
Amazing, right?

14:38.870 --> 14:40.880
Yeah.

14:42.840 --> 14:44.000
What's wrong?

14:44.200 --> 14:49.000
Oh, well, Gemma,
Zenay gave you Black girl hair.

14:49.200 --> 14:51.540
She did?
What did you ask her for?

14:51.740 --> 14:54.770
She told me to pick out
a picture of what I wanted.

14:54.970 --> 14:56.070
Out of what magazine?

14:56.270 --> 14:57.810
<i>Hype Hair.</i>

14:58.010 --> 15:01.700
Queen Latifah was
on the cover-- Oh!

15:03.130 --> 15:04.350
Oh, my God.

15:04.550 --> 15:06.620
Am I a cultural appropriator?

15:06.820 --> 15:09.620
Well, no, we could get away
with the ponytail...

15:09.820 --> 15:11.520
Uh-huh.
...and the swoop is not so bad.

15:11.720 --> 15:13.430
I'm just a little worried
about the, um...

15:13.630 --> 15:16.410
Okay, baby hair. (laughs)

15:17.510 --> 15:19.460
I see you, Principal Johnson.

15:19.660 --> 15:21.630
Oh, thank you.
Mm-hmm.

15:21.830 --> 15:23.740
Ooh, let me get a picture
so I can put it on the 'Gram.

15:23.940 --> 15:25.300
Ooh, mosquito.

15:25.500 --> 15:28.460
Go to the bathroom!
Go to the bathroom!

15:30.230 --> 15:31.680
I'm the one
with the money.

15:31.880 --> 15:33.750
I'm the one with the
business experience.

15:33.950 --> 15:35.710
Marty should be happy
to follow my lead.

15:35.910 --> 15:38.750
But Marty does have expertise
that you don't have.

15:38.950 --> 15:42.190
Sure, but he was
blatantly disrespectful to me,

15:42.390 --> 15:43.590
and I'm not having that.

15:43.790 --> 15:46.390
Okay, but Calvin, to be honest,

15:46.590 --> 15:48.990
you disrespected him first.

15:49.190 --> 15:52.100
He's my kid.
That's not disrespect, right?

15:52.300 --> 15:53.430
I'm just setting him straight.

15:53.630 --> 15:55.430
Calvin, that's just it.

15:55.630 --> 15:58.570
You know, he's not a kid.
He's your business partner.

15:58.770 --> 16:00.590
You can't do this without him.

16:02.390 --> 16:03.980
Well, I guess that's true.

16:04.180 --> 16:05.240
You know it's true.

16:05.440 --> 16:07.150
What I know is
I liked the world better

16:07.350 --> 16:11.030
when Marty did what I said,
and you lived in Michigan.

16:13.200 --> 16:15.790
(whimpering)
I don't know
what we could do.

16:15.990 --> 16:18.560
I mean, the-the gel--
it's-it's like glue.

16:18.760 --> 16:21.360
Well, try anything.
I don't want to offend people.

16:21.560 --> 16:23.300
Will they take my AWARE away?

16:23.500 --> 16:26.400
No. No, no. Okay,
we got this.
Okay.

16:26.600 --> 16:28.730
Let me just see
what I got in my purse.
Okay.

16:28.930 --> 16:30.200
Oh, so... (groans)

16:30.400 --> 16:34.270
All right, so we got, uh,
eyeshadow, we have a nail file.

16:34.470 --> 16:35.610
We've got ChapStick.

16:35.810 --> 16:37.610
Oh, a ticket stub
to the Ludacris concert.

16:37.810 --> 16:39.810
Uh, two M&Ms
and a book of matches.

16:40.010 --> 16:42.750
Ooh, we can light the curtains
and pull the fire alarm.

16:42.950 --> 16:44.380
No, Gemma.

16:44.580 --> 16:46.720
Just be quiet
and-and hold still.

16:46.920 --> 16:48.850
I'm going to use my nail file,
and I'm going to see

16:49.050 --> 16:51.090
if I could pry
this piece loose, okay?

16:51.290 --> 16:53.730
Let me see if I...
Aah!

16:53.930 --> 16:55.810
(both screaming)

16:57.580 --> 16:59.430
So as you can see
on your syllabus,

16:59.630 --> 17:04.200
next week, we'll be discussing
Joyce Carol Oates.

17:04.400 --> 17:07.810
So, start reading.

17:08.010 --> 17:10.060
See you all next week.

17:11.790 --> 17:14.030
Uh... (clears throat)

17:15.260 --> 17:18.220
So, everyone gets a syllabus
but me?

17:18.420 --> 17:21.250
Well, you'll get one, but only
if I can get my sock back.

17:21.450 --> 17:22.620
(laughs)

17:22.820 --> 17:25.360
Okay, that is fair.

17:25.560 --> 17:27.440
Thanks.

17:28.310 --> 17:29.490
Thank you.

17:29.690 --> 17:31.100
Um, I'd look on the back
of that syllabus.

17:31.300 --> 17:32.810
There's some extra credit.

17:34.980 --> 17:37.000
Oh, and Malcolm,

17:37.200 --> 17:39.390
I'm sure you can get it.

17:44.890 --> 17:46.930
(laughing)

17:53.640 --> 17:55.770
Can I just be happy, Stew?

17:56.570 --> 17:59.070
I got the teacher's number,
man. Look, look.

18:01.280 --> 18:03.030
In the past five years,

18:03.230 --> 18:06.000
our school has made
major strides in diversity,

18:06.200 --> 18:08.900
and credit for that goes
to our principal.

18:09.100 --> 18:10.600
She has helped...
Where is Gemma?

18:10.800 --> 18:12.470
They're about
to call her out onstage.

18:12.670 --> 18:15.020
Maybe she hosting
<i>The Hip Hop Awards.</i>

18:16.620 --> 18:18.980
PRESENTER:
And we must do this

18:19.180 --> 18:21.410
if we truly are serious about
making a change for the better.

18:21.610 --> 18:23.420
Hat. Hat.
Hmm? What, baby?

18:23.620 --> 18:26.130
Hat!
Oh.

18:28.600 --> 18:31.460
And so, it's my distinct
pleasure to introduce

18:31.660 --> 18:33.930
this year's winner
of the AWARE Award,

18:34.130 --> 18:36.110
Ms. Gemma Johnson.

18:38.010 --> 18:39.510
Gemma?

18:46.120 --> 18:47.610
Thank you, Fiona.

18:47.810 --> 18:49.470
I'm so grateful for this honor,

18:49.670 --> 18:50.980
and I am humbled by it.

18:51.180 --> 18:54.850
She spent eight hours
in the salon for that?

18:55.050 --> 18:57.770
Stay in your lane, Dave.
Stay in your lane.

18:59.130 --> 19:01.720
Despite the fact that
I'm winning this AWARE Award,

19:01.920 --> 19:05.190
I am painfully aware
that there are still a lot

19:05.390 --> 19:06.760
of things I don't know.

19:06.960 --> 19:09.830
And I have blind spots
I never knew about.

19:10.030 --> 19:11.700
But I'm not going
to stop trying.

19:11.900 --> 19:13.400
Yes. Yes.
That's real talk.

19:13.600 --> 19:14.930
That's real talk right there.

19:15.130 --> 19:16.500
TINA:
Yes.

19:16.700 --> 19:19.700
B-Baby, does Gemma
have a face tattoo,

19:19.900 --> 19:22.620
or is she rocking baby hair?

19:25.230 --> 19:26.410
You know what?

19:26.610 --> 19:28.660
Daddy likes.

19:36.500 --> 19:38.570
(knocking)

19:42.940 --> 19:44.660
Dad, you knocked?

19:44.860 --> 19:47.200
Well, if you think
that's crazy, buckle up.

19:47.400 --> 19:49.350
I'm about to apologize.

19:50.180 --> 19:52.190
Well, in that case, come on in.

19:52.990 --> 19:54.570
Look, son,

19:54.770 --> 19:57.280
I'm just used
to being my own boss,

19:57.480 --> 20:00.180
but now that I have
a partner, I guess...

20:00.380 --> 20:01.810
we're the boss.

20:02.010 --> 20:04.920
And I'm just having a hard time
getting used to that.

20:05.120 --> 20:06.550
Look, Dad,

20:06.750 --> 20:08.750
if we're going to be partners,
you have to consult me

20:08.950 --> 20:10.260
on every business decision.

20:10.460 --> 20:13.840
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah, I guess, yeah.

20:15.940 --> 20:17.900
I guess that's good enough.

20:18.100 --> 20:20.830
You know, actually, I'm happy

20:21.030 --> 20:24.570
because I get to piggyback
off your brilliance.

20:24.770 --> 20:27.770
Aw.
Which you inherited
from me, so...

20:27.970 --> 20:30.340
Hey.
There it is.

20:30.540 --> 20:32.610
You really don't know how
to apologize, do you?

20:32.810 --> 20:34.080
Well, actually, I do.

20:34.280 --> 20:36.610
I've, uh... I've come up with
a new name for the business.

20:36.810 --> 20:38.220
You ready?
Yeah.

20:38.420 --> 20:41.300
Butler and Butler.

20:42.100 --> 20:44.490
I like it.
It's me <i>and</i> you.

20:44.690 --> 20:48.130
Well, you're the second Butler.
Okay. Yeah, of course.

20:48.330 --> 20:49.290
Yeah.
Of course. Naturally.

20:49.490 --> 20:52.700
Oh. Hello... again.

20:52.900 --> 20:56.180
Well, there you are.
Malcolm, I found her!
