WEBVTT

01:09.324 --> 01:10.325
Yes!

01:10.409 --> 01:11.994
What happened? What's the score?

01:12.077 --> 01:14.621
<i>Just making sure you're awake down there.</i>

01:14.663 --> 01:16.582
That's not funny!

01:16.665 --> 01:19.209
I've got three big ones riding on this game.

01:59.750 --> 02:02.628
- Hey, Frank? Come in, over.
<i>- Yeah?</i>

02:02.711 --> 02:04.421
Are you picking up anything
on the monitor?

02:05.213 --> 02:06.757
<i>No. Why? What do you see?</i>

02:06.840 --> 02:09.717
Well, nothing, I could have sworn I just...

02:09.800 --> 02:11.219
No, forget it, Frank.

02:29.363 --> 02:30.364
No way!

02:30.405 --> 02:32.699
Dom, you were right.
There's someone behind you!

02:32.741 --> 02:34.576
Dom, look! Right behind you!

02:34.660 --> 02:36.328
What are you talking about?
There's no one behind me.

02:36.411 --> 02:38.080
You sneaky son of a...

02:42.292 --> 02:45.504
He's on the top floor! I'm coming!
Don't let him get by you!

02:45.754 --> 02:47.756
This is perfect! We got him trapped!

02:47.881 --> 02:49.299
Where are you, exactly?

02:50.926 --> 02:52.386
Not too far away.

02:52.427 --> 02:54.846
And you, where are you, exactly?

04:22.517 --> 04:24.060
I didn't hear you, Zoé!

04:24.144 --> 04:26.646
Have you got something to show me?

04:26.688 --> 04:28.023
Look at that!

04:28.064 --> 04:30.525
Is that another present from Dino?

04:32.110 --> 04:35.530
That's quite a collection you've got.
Lucky you.

04:35.572 --> 04:37.699
That cat's trying to spoil you rotten!

04:37.741 --> 04:39.117
Well.

04:39.201 --> 04:42.537
It's not what other little girls play with,
but so what?

04:42.579 --> 04:44.414
Maybe you're part cat.

04:53.131 --> 04:55.425
Now what is it?

04:55.509 --> 04:57.219
I hear what you're saying, but no.

04:57.260 --> 04:59.304
Listen, Lucas, we'll talk about it tomorrow.

04:59.387 --> 05:02.933
I need a few hours off, okay?
I promised my daughter.

05:03.016 --> 05:07.145
Now, I expect to see that report on my desk
first thing tomorrow morning.

05:07.229 --> 05:11.608
What, do you want me to hold your hand?
You're a big boy, aren't you?

05:11.691 --> 05:12.692
What's wrong with her?

05:12.734 --> 05:14.569
She had something
she wanted to show you.

05:14.611 --> 05:16.571
Something? Well, what is it?

05:16.613 --> 05:19.908
Nothing, really. You know how kids are.

05:19.950 --> 05:22.953
She was just waiting for you.
She's very sensitive.

05:25.956 --> 05:28.333
I can't seem to do anything right.

05:28.416 --> 05:30.919
I'm exhausted.

05:30.961 --> 05:34.297
It's so tough these days
with just me and Zoé.

05:34.381 --> 05:38.260
If only her dad were still here. I miss him.

05:38.343 --> 05:40.303
I think about him every day.

05:40.387 --> 05:43.431
Come now, madam, please don't cry.

05:43.473 --> 05:45.809
Or I'll start, too.

06:01.700 --> 06:03.785
Zoé, dear.

06:03.827 --> 06:05.287
May I come in?

06:07.789 --> 06:10.125
I'm so sorry, Zoé.

06:10.166 --> 06:13.795
It's just that I've got a lot going on
at work right now.

06:13.879 --> 06:17.591
And sometimes I bring it home
when I shouldn't.

06:17.632 --> 06:20.886
Anyway, it seems you're getting along
with Claudine?

06:21.595 --> 06:24.848
I like her, too,
except for that perfume she wears.

06:25.307 --> 06:27.601
Bless you!

06:27.642 --> 06:31.438
Now, what is it you wanted
to show me, Zoé?

06:35.191 --> 06:36.943
That's disgusting!

06:36.985 --> 06:39.487
I wish Dino would stop doing that.

06:41.865 --> 06:44.492
We've been through this, Zoé!

06:44.534 --> 06:49.915
You cannot go on keeping dead animals
in your room like this. It's filthy.

06:49.998 --> 06:51.166
Sorry, I've got to take this.

06:51.750 --> 06:53.043
Hello?

06:53.126 --> 06:54.294
I'm at home.

06:54.336 --> 06:56.171
Can't you guys handle this?

06:56.212 --> 06:59.299
Well, ask Lucas.
He knows where everything is.

07:08.516 --> 07:11.478
Well, unless there's anything else,
I'll be going.

07:11.519 --> 07:14.022
Thank you, Claudine. See you tomorrow.

07:14.064 --> 07:16.316
You really are a lifesaver, you know that?

07:16.358 --> 07:17.859
And I'll see you tomorrow.

07:17.943 --> 07:19.027
Get home safe, Claudine.

07:20.236 --> 07:23.365
You don't need to worry about me, madam.

07:27.953 --> 07:31.414
I'm sorry about getting upset
earlier today, Zoé, it's just that...

07:31.498 --> 07:33.375
You know what I'm saying.

07:33.458 --> 07:37.629
Little girls shouldn't be playing
with dead lizards, insects...

07:38.088 --> 07:39.714
You understand.

07:41.383 --> 07:44.052
Zoé, I know how you feel.

07:45.679 --> 07:48.848
Since we lost him, it seems like
things haven't been right between us.

07:49.808 --> 07:53.645
I can't think of anything harder
than a girl losing her father.

07:53.728 --> 07:56.898
But there's nothing we can do
to bring him back.

07:56.982 --> 08:00.318
We'll just have to keep going on
without him.

08:01.027 --> 08:06.282
You know, it would make me so happy
if I could just hear you say "mommy."

08:06.866 --> 08:09.744
But take your time. I can wait.

08:11.538 --> 08:13.456
Forever if I have to.

08:15.250 --> 08:18.128
Now, let's forget all about this.

08:18.211 --> 08:21.047
What if the two of us went
to the movies next Sunday?

08:21.089 --> 08:23.258
It's been a long time, huh?

08:25.343 --> 08:27.804
Look at that. The terrible tomcat.

08:27.887 --> 08:29.723
I think it's time to go hunting.

08:31.516 --> 08:36.145
I do wonder what that villain gets up
to every night, don't you?

08:50.744 --> 08:53.288
Rufus! Shut up, Rufus!

08:54.789 --> 08:57.584
Rufus, you dumb dog!

08:57.625 --> 08:58.793
Shut up!

09:08.887 --> 09:10.680
What's up, pussycat?

09:10.805 --> 09:14.392
Figured you made other plans,
so I started without you.

09:16.144 --> 09:19.481
There you go. Eat up.
You'll need your strength.

09:19.522 --> 09:23.985
I think you'll quite enjoy
what I have in store for us this evening.

09:30.158 --> 09:34.329
Let's go, my friend. We're off.
We've got work to do.

09:34.412 --> 09:36.331
Are you coming?

09:58.144 --> 10:00.480
Nicely done, show-off.

13:01.911 --> 13:03.663
Hey, hold on a minute!

13:03.705 --> 13:06.249
I've got something for you. Look!

13:11.170 --> 13:15.550
And what does
my fish-loving friend think of this?

13:15.591 --> 13:17.135
Not bad, huh?

13:23.349 --> 13:25.893
In the end, they always leave me.

14:04.807 --> 14:06.434
Zoé, what are you doing?

14:06.476 --> 14:08.311
Going through my briefcase again?

14:08.394 --> 14:09.687
You know I don't like that!

14:11.189 --> 14:14.233
Yes, sweetie, that's him.

14:14.275 --> 14:16.027
That's the man who killed your father.

14:17.820 --> 14:20.615
You know what?
Mommy's going to find him.

14:20.656 --> 14:23.785
And when I bring him in,
they'll throw him in jail forever.

14:23.826 --> 14:25.953
That I promise you!

14:28.539 --> 14:31.793
Zoé, you're my little girl.

14:31.876 --> 14:34.295
I'll always take care of you.

14:34.379 --> 14:36.130
Don't you forget it.

14:40.927 --> 14:43.137
- Morning.
- Superintendent.

14:43.179 --> 14:45.848
I'm almost done here.
I just need 10 more minutes.

14:45.932 --> 14:47.100
Forget about the report.

14:47.141 --> 14:49.268
I need you to look into something else
for me right now.

14:49.727 --> 14:51.437
Okay. What you got?

14:51.646 --> 14:53.731
That spree of jewel burglaries.

14:53.815 --> 14:55.775
- Have you been following those?
- Yeah.

14:55.817 --> 14:57.652
Well, the lab found something curious.

14:57.735 --> 14:59.987
At each of the locations
they found cat paw prints.

15:00.071 --> 15:01.322
Cat paw prints?

15:01.406 --> 15:04.992
The boss wants us to go all out.
I'm putting you on it.

15:05.034 --> 15:07.286
You have 24 hours to turn something up.
Got it?

15:07.328 --> 15:09.038
Understood, Superintendent.

15:09.122 --> 15:13.000
Good. Well, then,
let me know when you got something.

15:14.168 --> 15:16.587
A feline felon.

15:16.671 --> 15:20.633
Great! Ten years on the force
and this is what I get.

15:21.843 --> 15:24.220
Move already, you rotten animal!

15:25.096 --> 15:27.098
Get! Scram!

15:27.181 --> 15:28.307
Get off that chair!

15:28.349 --> 15:31.894
I'm sick of cleaning up after you,
you mangy cat!

15:32.270 --> 15:33.271
Shoo!

15:34.605 --> 15:37.400
If you won't move, I'll just suck you up!

15:39.360 --> 15:41.904
<i>Au revoir,</i> and good riddance!

15:51.247 --> 15:53.499
All right, everyone, listen up.

15:54.208 --> 15:56.669
This is the Colossus of Nairobi.

15:56.711 --> 15:58.463
Not only is it a priceless work of art,

15:58.546 --> 16:01.841
but it hasn't been displayed in public
for over 30 years.

16:01.883 --> 16:05.678
It's scheduled to be transported
to the museum this Friday.

16:05.720 --> 16:07.972
Of course, they're taking every precaution.

16:08.806 --> 16:12.560
Victor Costa. He requires no introduction.

16:12.643 --> 16:16.147
As everyone knows, Victor Costa
is still public enemy number one.

16:16.314 --> 16:19.400
And what he wants more than anything
is the Colossus.

16:20.193 --> 16:27.074
His last attempt was almost successful
and, as some of you know, it cost us...

16:27.158 --> 16:29.076
It cost us the life of a fellow officer.

16:29.744 --> 16:31.245
Hey, what's wrong with her?

16:31.329 --> 16:33.581
The cop she's talking about
was her husband.

16:33.623 --> 16:37.543
Needless to say, he's extremely dangerous,
so proceed with caution.

16:37.585 --> 16:39.253
The man is a raving lunatic.

16:39.837 --> 16:43.257
Now, let's take a look at the route
they'll be using to transport the Colossus.

16:43.299 --> 16:46.010
We need to be ready
when Victor Costa shows up.

16:46.594 --> 16:50.765
There's no doubt in my mind
that this is where he'll make his move.

16:50.890 --> 16:54.602
All right, that's it for now.
See you at target practice.

16:54.685 --> 16:56.437
Stay sharp.

18:30.239 --> 18:31.949
Listen up, boys.

18:32.033 --> 18:33.868
This is the one I've been waiting for.

18:34.410 --> 18:37.121
My sweet mother hung this over my crib.

18:37.204 --> 18:40.041
It's my earliest memory. And now I want it!

18:40.124 --> 18:42.043
You hear me? It's mine!

18:46.380 --> 18:49.050
Look, here he comes with all the food.

18:49.091 --> 18:51.135
About time! What happened?

18:51.218 --> 18:53.888
- It's been like half an hour already.
- It's not my fault!

18:53.929 --> 18:56.432
There was a huge line and no selection.

18:56.515 --> 19:00.436
- Who wants a ham sandwich?
- That's me! I love ham.

19:00.519 --> 19:02.563
That hot dog's got my name all over it.

19:02.605 --> 19:05.066
Hurry up with that!
I'm not paying you to eat.

19:05.149 --> 19:07.735
- That's not Italian sausage!
- They don't do that there.

19:07.777 --> 19:10.237
They're not Italian. So, I got you chicken.

19:10.321 --> 19:13.115
Chicken? What are you trying to do, kill me?

19:13.199 --> 19:15.868
You know I'm allergic
to anything with feathers.

19:15.910 --> 19:18.245
I never get what I want.

19:18.329 --> 19:20.414
I'm sorry. I've got other stuff!

19:21.415 --> 19:23.334
So, why you giving me chicken, then?

19:23.584 --> 19:27.421
He didn't mean nothing by it.
I'll swap you my hot dog if you want.

19:27.505 --> 19:30.091
You think a hot dog is a substitute
for sausage?

19:30.132 --> 19:32.635
- I'll take it.
- Hey, he offered it to me!

19:33.469 --> 19:35.721
What about you, boss? Are you hungry?

19:35.763 --> 19:37.640
I've got a quiche.

19:37.723 --> 19:39.392
Does that quiche have bacon in it?

19:39.433 --> 19:42.603
Yes! And hot melted cheese all over it!

19:42.687 --> 19:44.605
What about cream?

19:44.689 --> 19:49.443
- Is there cream inside?
<i>- Oui,</i> boss, you bet. It's the creamiest!

19:49.485 --> 19:52.780
So, I look like a quiche-eater to you, do I?
Is that what you think?

19:52.822 --> 19:55.199
What? Is that a bad thing? I did.

19:55.282 --> 19:57.910
But you were the one
who brought up the cream and the bacon...

19:57.952 --> 19:59.787
I heard what you said!

19:59.870 --> 20:02.164
So I'm the kind of bloke who's into quiche?

20:02.248 --> 20:04.667
That's what you said, isn't it? Well?

20:08.129 --> 20:10.840
Wound you up there, didn't I?

20:10.923 --> 20:13.467
You'd nearly gone and wet your undies.

20:13.551 --> 20:16.095
Yeah, you really had me going
for a minute, boss.

20:16.178 --> 20:17.930
You had me going
with that whole cream thing!

20:17.972 --> 20:21.475
Would you like to know
why I like my quiche with cream?

20:22.393 --> 20:23.769
That's why!

20:23.811 --> 20:26.814
Now, get a move on before I lose my temper.

20:40.369 --> 20:43.122
Hey, what's that, Zoé?

20:43.164 --> 20:44.999
Where'd you get that?

20:45.833 --> 20:48.294
No, no, no, I don't mean the drawing.

20:48.377 --> 20:52.006
I mean the new bracelet that you're wearing.
Where'd you get it?

20:54.175 --> 20:56.886
What? You mean Dino gave it you?

20:58.888 --> 21:00.806
Zoé, sweetie, listen to me.

21:00.848 --> 21:04.852
I'm really glad Dino's not bringing you
dead animals anymore.

21:04.935 --> 21:08.189
But you can't keep that.
It doesn't belong to you.

21:08.230 --> 21:10.232
Look, it's got diamonds in it.

21:11.150 --> 21:14.403
Honey, somebody out there
is probably very upset right now

21:14.487 --> 21:16.238
because they lost their bracelet.

21:17.198 --> 21:20.159
Why don't we find out who lost it
and give it back to her?

21:22.369 --> 21:24.955
That's my girl. I'm so proud of you.

21:26.373 --> 21:29.043
My cat brought this in the house last night.

21:29.126 --> 21:31.629
Don't ask me where he found it.
I have no idea.

21:31.712 --> 21:33.756
But I need you to check
to see if there's any connection

21:33.839 --> 21:36.383
with that burglary on Mouffetard Street,
all right?

21:36.467 --> 21:39.345
Good. I'll check with you later.

21:43.891 --> 21:46.685
The Mouffetard Street burglary.

22:01.826 --> 22:05.120
Sweet dreams, sweetheart.
Mommy's got to work tonight.

22:05.496 --> 22:07.706
But Claudine will take care of you!

22:07.790 --> 22:11.085
Be a good girl
and go straight to sleep, okay?

22:16.090 --> 22:19.218
Sleep tight, little Zoé.

23:16.483 --> 23:19.278
Not tonight, Rufus! I mean it!

23:19.320 --> 23:22.489
Rufus, are you listening to me?
That's enough!

23:22.531 --> 23:25.910
Tonight is the night this stops!
I mean it, Rufus!

23:39.506 --> 23:40.966
Rufus!

23:42.384 --> 23:44.261
Shut up!

23:44.345 --> 23:46.513
Great, now my feet are cold.

23:49.141 --> 23:50.142
Rufus!

23:53.979 --> 23:55.689
There you are!

23:56.649 --> 23:58.859
I hope you realize you're late.

23:58.943 --> 24:01.278
What kept you? I almost left without you.

24:22.633 --> 24:25.552
What makes you think "potato"
when you look at me?

24:25.594 --> 24:28.263
You don't look like a potato.
That is not the point.

24:28.514 --> 24:31.684
They are code names.
Just code names, okay?

24:31.767 --> 24:35.062
Yeah, but code names are always based on
what people think of you!

24:35.104 --> 24:38.524
Well, my code name is "Baby,"
but you don't think of me as a baby.

24:38.565 --> 24:39.900
- Do you?
- Shut it!

24:39.942 --> 24:41.902
You'll take these names and like 'em.

24:41.944 --> 24:43.570
You're Mr. Frog.

24:43.612 --> 24:45.406
You're Mr. Baby.

24:45.447 --> 24:47.074
You're Mr. Hulot.

24:47.157 --> 24:49.243
And you're Mr. Potato. Got it?

24:49.326 --> 24:51.412
I got it, boss. And I like potatoes.

24:51.829 --> 24:53.914
And what do we call you, boss?

24:53.956 --> 24:56.417
<i>Moi?</i> Glad you asked!

24:56.458 --> 24:58.502
I'm the Colossus of Nairobi!

24:58.585 --> 25:00.879
That name is perfect!

25:00.921 --> 25:03.424
Enough! We're losing valuable time.

25:03.465 --> 25:05.718
Gorgeous? What do you got for me?

25:05.759 --> 25:08.470
Keep your voice down. You'll like this.

25:08.637 --> 25:12.808
Here. This is when they're going to be
transporting the Colossus.

25:12.891 --> 25:15.769
But we shouldn't be meeting here.
It's too risky.

25:15.853 --> 25:17.438
You need to be patient, baby.

25:17.521 --> 25:20.774
Patient! I've been waiting
for this my whole life.

25:20.899 --> 25:23.318
Go through her papers,
search through her computer,

25:23.402 --> 25:25.112
look under her bed if you have to.

25:25.195 --> 25:27.698
I need to know exactly
where that truck is going to be!

25:27.781 --> 25:29.283
You don't want me to blow my cover.

25:31.952 --> 25:34.663
- What's she doing here?
- It's the daughter! She heard everything!

25:36.623 --> 25:39.710
What are you waiting for? Get her!

25:52.973 --> 25:55.559
- What are we supposed to do now?
- Should we go in there?

25:56.185 --> 25:58.687
What are you standing around for?

26:00.481 --> 26:03.776
Find that girl and bring her to me.
Get a move on!

26:03.817 --> 26:05.527
We're on it, boss!

26:11.492 --> 26:13.660
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

26:14.828 --> 26:16.830
I know you're here, little girl.

26:17.623 --> 26:20.751
Perhaps you're in one of these cupboards.

26:20.834 --> 26:22.544
All alone.

26:22.628 --> 26:25.005
Let's have a peek.

26:30.552 --> 26:32.763
You're name's Zoé, isn't it?

26:32.846 --> 26:35.307
I know these things.

26:36.767 --> 26:40.020
I know all sorts of things about you,
Zoé, my dear.

26:40.229 --> 26:43.023
Now let me tell you something about me.
You know what I hate?

26:43.398 --> 26:46.235
It's how in the movies, when the victims
are hiding from the bad guys,

26:46.318 --> 26:49.446
they always end up being
in the last place he looks.

26:51.240 --> 26:53.492
Now I'm going to count to three, little piggy,

26:53.534 --> 26:56.036
and then I'm going
to blow your house down.

26:57.037 --> 27:01.375
- One. Two...
- Boss, you won't believe this!

27:01.416 --> 27:03.877
This is amazing!
You've got to see what've we found.

27:03.919 --> 27:05.504
So, did you find the girl?

27:05.546 --> 27:07.840
Just come, you won't believe it, Mr. Costa!

27:08.257 --> 27:11.051
Why don't you just announce
my home address while you're at it?

27:11.135 --> 27:15.472
The whole point of having code names is
to avoid using our real names, you idiot!

27:15.597 --> 27:18.142
- I'm sorry, boss... Colossus.
- Shut up!

27:26.441 --> 27:28.569
All right, then, where is she?
Where's the girl?

27:28.610 --> 27:29.820
Look right over there! Look!

27:29.903 --> 27:32.447
What are you talking about?
There's no girl over there.

27:32.531 --> 27:34.116
No, not the girl. The dartboard!

27:34.199 --> 27:36.034
What are you boys playing at?

27:36.076 --> 27:38.745
I can't take this.
Someone wake me up from this nightmare!

27:38.829 --> 27:41.790
Don't cry, boss, trust us!
You'll love this dartboard!

27:41.874 --> 27:44.168
I'd love to take that dartboard and shove it...

27:44.251 --> 27:47.004
No, no, no, please! Let Mr. Hulot show you.

27:54.386 --> 27:56.430
Isn't that a pretty sight?

27:56.513 --> 27:59.266
Ali Baba's cave.
And I found it for you, boss!

27:59.349 --> 28:01.727
He just can't help himself
when he sees a dartboard.

28:01.768 --> 28:04.188
Doesn't this take the biscuit!

28:04.271 --> 28:08.233
I've found someone's treasure, haven't I?

28:08.275 --> 28:10.611
But the question is, whose?

28:22.289 --> 28:24.750
So, you little snoop, you proud of yourself?

28:24.791 --> 28:27.044
Feel like a detective? Like your mommy?

28:27.836 --> 28:30.464
Stop squirming, you brat!

28:30.547 --> 28:32.507
Ladies, I hope I'm not interrupting.

28:33.383 --> 28:35.219
But what are you doing in my house?

28:35.427 --> 28:37.429
Do excuse us.

28:37.471 --> 28:39.348
This one's always running away from home.

28:39.431 --> 28:41.850
I spend all my time chasing after her.

28:41.934 --> 28:43.936
Come on, Zoé! Let's go home now.

28:44.853 --> 28:47.773
Hold it! It doesn't look to me like she wants
to go home with you.

28:47.814 --> 28:49.650
Who are you, anyway? Not her mother?

28:49.691 --> 28:51.151
Zoé, it's time to go!

28:51.235 --> 28:53.612
No one's going anywhere
until I find out the truth.

28:53.654 --> 28:56.406
Colossus! We've got a problem!
The owner's back!

28:56.490 --> 28:59.117
Don't worry, angel face,
we're coming for you!

29:00.202 --> 29:02.704
I've had enough! Come on, move!

29:03.247 --> 29:05.832
A nice man like you
would never hit a woman, would you?

29:08.293 --> 29:09.878
- I hate that cat!
- Open the door!

29:09.962 --> 29:11.922
Unlock this door at once!

29:12.547 --> 29:14.341
You, bash it down, now!

29:14.424 --> 29:16.677
I can't. I hurt my shoulder!

29:16.760 --> 29:18.428
What are you going on about?

29:18.553 --> 29:19.805
I need you to trust me.

29:19.846 --> 29:23.183
Just climb on my back
and hold on as tight as you can.

29:23.225 --> 29:25.185
Maybe it's the kind of door you pull,
not push.

29:25.310 --> 29:28.522
Everybody just shut up and hit it together!

29:30.816 --> 29:33.527
There! There! They're on the roof!

29:33.568 --> 29:36.196
Look up there. They're getting away!

30:11.565 --> 30:14.943
Help! Frog, Potato! I'm slipping!

30:15.027 --> 30:17.529
I'm going to break my neck! Help!

30:19.239 --> 30:21.908
Thank you, Mister...

30:21.992 --> 30:25.912
So, do I still call you Colossus
when it's just the two of us,

30:25.954 --> 30:28.040
or do I call you boss?

30:29.750 --> 30:31.043
Quiet.

30:44.097 --> 30:47.142
Listen to me, Zoé,
you see that hedge over there?

30:47.225 --> 30:49.186
Behind it is the zoo. Now go.

30:49.519 --> 30:51.188
You and the cat can hide in there.

30:51.271 --> 30:54.274
I'll stay behind and lead those men off
in the wrong direction.

30:54.358 --> 30:56.777
When it's safe, I'll come and find you. Hurry!

31:09.498 --> 31:10.749
- Look!
- There!

31:24.763 --> 31:26.723
Smells like fresh meat!

31:26.807 --> 31:31.645
- Are you smelling flowers, boss?
- Never mind. Just follow me.

31:31.728 --> 31:32.813
We've got her!

31:42.072 --> 31:43.198
Looky here.

31:43.532 --> 31:46.326
Now, what did I tell you?
Come on, give me a boost!

31:55.502 --> 31:57.170
Yes? Can I help you?

31:57.212 --> 31:58.880
Evening. Police Department.

31:58.964 --> 32:00.966
- But I haven't...
- No need to worry, madam.

32:01.007 --> 32:04.594
You're not in trouble.
I'm only here to ask you a few questions.

32:04.678 --> 32:06.847
You wouldn't happen
to know anything about a black cat,

32:06.930 --> 32:08.515
wanders around here at night,

32:08.557 --> 32:10.684
lives across the street in that brick house?

32:10.725 --> 32:15.397
That cat. I know that cat, all right.
He's a menace!

32:15.605 --> 32:18.024
Every single night of the week,

32:18.108 --> 32:22.195
that cat gets out
and upsets my neighbor's yappy dog.

32:22.237 --> 32:23.864
And it gives me a headache!

32:23.947 --> 32:25.198
Yeah, that sounds terrible.

32:25.240 --> 32:27.659
Look, have you got any idea
where the cat goes?

32:27.701 --> 32:29.161
After visiting the dog?

32:29.202 --> 32:31.955
Well, I don't think he goes very far.

32:32.038 --> 32:37.043
He leaves from there, goes over
and then riles up Rufus, that's the dog,

32:37.127 --> 32:40.172
and disappears into
that house across the street.

32:40.380 --> 32:43.383
Every single night, it's the same!

32:43.800 --> 32:46.720
So, are you going to arrest him, officer?

32:53.226 --> 32:55.353
Hello?

32:57.564 --> 32:59.566
You found a lead on the cat burglar?

32:59.649 --> 33:01.526
Great. Where are you?

33:01.568 --> 33:02.611
You're where?

33:02.694 --> 33:04.821
You're at my place? What do you mean?

33:04.905 --> 33:05.989
All right, I'll be right there.

33:17.667 --> 33:21.338
Please, I cannot go on.
Please, don't make me! I am kaput!

33:21.421 --> 33:24.883
Stop being a baby, Mr. Baby!
He's going to escape!

33:26.551 --> 33:27.719
It's all the ham I ate.

33:27.761 --> 33:29.763
Quit your bellyaching! He's getting away!

33:30.430 --> 33:32.557
Do you guys need a lift?

33:37.687 --> 33:39.439
Now we'll see who's faster.

33:39.523 --> 33:41.483
Come on, crank this thing up!

33:41.983 --> 33:44.194
No, I can't stop it!

33:56.706 --> 33:59.292
- So, you think he made it?
- From this height?

33:59.376 --> 34:03.129
Trust me, anyone who falls from up here
will have more than a bump on his head.

34:03.213 --> 34:05.632
That's if he even has a head left!

34:58.143 --> 34:59.144
No!

35:01.354 --> 35:02.689
Mr. Frog!

35:02.731 --> 35:05.275
Hurry up and get her! I'm stuck!

35:05.358 --> 35:06.985
I would, but there's no more boats.

35:07.027 --> 35:09.195
Remind me what your codename is again?

35:09.279 --> 35:10.280
Mr. Frog.

35:10.363 --> 35:12.532
And tell me, do frogs need boats?

35:12.574 --> 35:15.035
- Now! Get in and bring her back to me!
- But...

35:15.076 --> 35:17.037
Mr. Frog is just my code name.

35:17.120 --> 35:18.705
I don't care!

35:18.747 --> 35:21.583
Your name is Mr. Frog and frogs swim.

35:21.708 --> 35:23.543
Now, will you hop in?

35:25.086 --> 35:26.796
What are you doing now?

35:26.880 --> 35:29.883
Well, I can't go in with my clothes on.
I'll get all wet!

35:29.924 --> 35:31.676
Don't worry, boss, I'm going in.

35:33.053 --> 35:36.973
Boy, oh, boy,
is this water freezing cold, boss!

35:37.057 --> 35:38.600
Okay.

35:43.605 --> 35:45.482
There's a good little froggy.

35:45.565 --> 35:47.692
You can't get away from me, you know!

35:47.734 --> 35:50.779
Playtime's over and I'm coming for you!

35:55.909 --> 35:57.702
You gotta be joking.

36:00.622 --> 36:02.749
Let me get this straight.

36:02.832 --> 36:04.626
This little froggy can't swim!

36:04.709 --> 36:08.672
No one ever taught me how, boss.
Maybe you could teach me?

36:08.755 --> 36:11.091
What do I look like, your daddy?

36:11.549 --> 36:16.388
Colossus of Nairobi,
why have you forsaken me?

36:23.019 --> 36:24.979
Zoé?

36:25.063 --> 36:26.147
Zoé?

36:30.944 --> 36:32.278
There you are.

36:33.113 --> 36:35.115
I see you found the old swing.

36:36.700 --> 36:39.035
I haven't used this thing in ages.

36:39.119 --> 36:43.164
You know, with all the excitement tonight,
we haven't been introduced.

36:43.289 --> 36:45.417
I'm Nico.

36:45.458 --> 36:46.626
So.

36:47.377 --> 36:50.088
Are you going to tell me what happened?

36:51.631 --> 36:54.551
What's the matter? Cat got your tongue?

36:57.971 --> 37:01.141
So, you don't talk,
but at least you can laugh.

37:01.182 --> 37:05.270
Now, then, can you tell me
where your parents are?

37:05.311 --> 37:09.274
You have a mom and dad, don't you?

37:09.315 --> 37:10.775
What is it?

37:10.817 --> 37:13.445
Did I say something wrong?

37:13.486 --> 37:16.823
All right. Well, in any case,
we can't stay here.

37:16.865 --> 37:18.491
They might come back.

37:18.575 --> 37:21.327
I know a place where you can hide.
You'll be safe.

37:21.369 --> 37:22.996
I just need to get the key first.

37:23.037 --> 37:25.498
Stay here. I'll be just a minute.

37:40.180 --> 37:41.431
Zoé?

37:43.057 --> 37:44.350
Police! Don't move!

37:44.684 --> 37:46.186
I said don't move!

37:46.269 --> 37:47.687
It's him, Superintendent.

37:47.771 --> 37:50.190
This is the burglar we've been looking for.

37:50.231 --> 37:52.859
And it looks like your cat's his accomplice.

37:52.942 --> 37:55.528
No, no, no! You don't understand!
It's not what it looks like!

37:55.570 --> 37:58.782
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, tell it to the judge.
- I was just trying to help this little girl!

37:58.865 --> 38:01.367
I think you should know it was
my daughter you tried to kidnap.

38:01.409 --> 38:03.745
- A cop's daughter.
- Just let me explain.

38:03.828 --> 38:06.456
You just made
the biggest mistake of your life!

38:06.539 --> 38:08.208
Calm down, Zoé.

38:08.291 --> 38:10.251
There's nothing to be afraid of now.

38:10.710 --> 38:13.046
We wouldn't want anything
to happen to you now, would we?

38:14.923 --> 38:16.049
What?

38:16.132 --> 38:18.551
And you! You're going to the pound!

38:20.428 --> 38:23.223
My little sweetie,
I was so worried about you!

38:24.808 --> 38:27.227
What is going on?
Would you explain it to me?

38:27.310 --> 38:28.645
It's that burglar you caught!

38:28.728 --> 38:30.730
He broke into the house to rob us.

38:30.772 --> 38:32.649
When he saw me, he panicked,

38:32.732 --> 38:35.610
then he grabbed Zoé right out
of her bed and left with her.

38:36.027 --> 38:38.446
- Who is that woman?
- Why don't you mind your own business?

38:38.530 --> 38:40.156
You have to listen to me! It's her!

38:40.240 --> 38:42.742
- I wasn't trying to kidnap Zoé, she was!
- Shut up, will ya?

38:42.826 --> 38:45.245
<i>Car 17, come in. Do you copy?</i>

38:45.328 --> 38:46.621
This is Car 17.

38:46.704 --> 38:50.291
All right, it's over now, princess.
Everything's going to be okay.

38:50.375 --> 38:53.044
Don't worry. Let's go home now.

38:53.086 --> 38:55.505
Mommy's going to stay
with you all night long, sweetheart.

38:55.588 --> 38:57.841
Superintendent, I'm sorry,
I know this is the worst time,

38:57.924 --> 38:59.676
but when I heard this,
I thought you'd want to know.

38:59.759 --> 39:01.636
- Immediately.
- Just spit it out, Lucas.

39:01.719 --> 39:03.555
There was just a report
of an attack at the zoo.

39:03.596 --> 39:05.890
A night watchman identified
the guy from a photo.

39:05.932 --> 39:07.851
- It's our guy, Costa.
- Costa.

39:07.934 --> 39:10.103
If we leave now, we might catch him.

39:10.144 --> 39:11.896
Listen to me, Zoé,

39:11.938 --> 39:15.608
I hate doing this to you.
But I can't take you home yet.

39:15.650 --> 39:17.193
I have to go.

39:17.277 --> 39:21.030
There's something important I must do,
for both of us.

39:21.114 --> 39:22.699
That man killed your dad

39:23.032 --> 39:26.160
and I can't just let him get away.
Do you understand?

39:26.244 --> 39:29.163
Don't worry about it, madam.
I'll look after Zoé.

39:29.247 --> 39:31.124
She's just in shock.

39:31.165 --> 39:33.376
But I'll take good care of her.

39:33.459 --> 39:36.379
- I'll take her back to the house right now.
- Thank you, Claudine.

39:36.462 --> 39:40.216
Zoé, I'll be back as soon as I can. I promise!

39:40.300 --> 39:41.634
You go!

39:41.676 --> 39:43.803
I'll take care of everything.

39:52.145 --> 39:53.646
Mama!

39:55.231 --> 39:58.818
Waited a little too long
to get your voice back, didn't you?

39:58.860 --> 39:59.986
Silly girl.

40:01.571 --> 40:03.823
I was saving your daughter
and you're arresting me?

40:03.865 --> 40:06.534
Sure. You walk around at night
looking for children to save.

40:06.618 --> 40:07.869
What kind of cop are you?

40:07.952 --> 40:10.496
You don't even know your own nanny
is working for Costa?

40:10.580 --> 40:13.499
Enough out of you. It's getting boring.

40:13.541 --> 40:15.168
But it's the truth, I swear!

40:15.251 --> 40:17.170
And all that money we found on you?

40:17.253 --> 40:19.505
That was for charitable purposes,
I suppose.

40:20.048 --> 40:21.841
It's always the same with these guys.

40:21.925 --> 40:23.801
"I'm innocent, I swear!"

40:25.470 --> 40:27.013
Lucas, watch out!

40:27.138 --> 40:29.307
- Get him off! Get him off!
- Hit the brakes!

40:31.184 --> 40:32.393
Dino, no!

40:33.853 --> 40:36.439
All right, now listen to me.

40:36.522 --> 40:37.607
Put the gun down.

40:37.690 --> 40:39.108
You're just making things worse
for yourself.

40:39.192 --> 40:42.862
Think whatever you want, but if I were you,
I'd get home right away.

40:42.904 --> 40:45.573
Zoé is in terrible danger!

41:00.004 --> 41:02.256
Okay, that was weird. Now what?

41:02.340 --> 41:05.218
What am I missing? I'm not sure, but...

41:06.219 --> 41:08.221
What if he's right?

41:09.555 --> 41:11.808
Come on, Lucas.
There's only one way to find out.

41:24.237 --> 41:25.780
Zoé?

41:25.863 --> 41:27.657
Claudine?

41:27.740 --> 41:28.741
Zoé?

41:30.743 --> 41:33.246
Something's wrong here.

41:33.287 --> 41:34.914
I'll go upstairs.

41:34.998 --> 41:36.958
You keep watch down here.

41:49.595 --> 41:51.639
Lucas, are you all right? Lucas!

41:51.723 --> 41:55.268
No, no! No, no, don't worry!
I just got startled and my gun went off.

41:56.352 --> 41:57.478
Lucas.

42:08.990 --> 42:11.242
Someone's going to pay for this right now!

42:11.492 --> 42:13.953
Or I'm gonna get really angry.

42:28.384 --> 42:31.220
It's all funny now, is that it?

42:31.304 --> 42:36.517
Teddybear, why so angry
when I got you such a lovely surprise?

42:37.477 --> 42:39.353
What do we have here?

42:39.479 --> 42:43.941
It's a nice little present,
all wrapped up neatly for Uncle Costa!

42:46.819 --> 42:51.824
Well, now. I hope you're proud of yourself
for giving me the runaround, you little pest.

42:51.991 --> 42:54.827
Luckily, I have you, my delicate flower.

42:54.911 --> 42:56.829
If I had to count on this lot of geniuses,

42:56.913 --> 43:00.833
I'd still be pinching sweets
from the corner shop.

43:00.875 --> 43:02.293
Hang on.

43:02.335 --> 43:03.878
I've just had a thought.

43:03.961 --> 43:06.672
This could be the solution
to all our problems!

43:06.756 --> 43:10.051
It might even turn this fiasco into a triumph.

43:10.134 --> 43:13.554
Having the kid is even better
than having the mother!

43:13.721 --> 43:17.725
Gentlemen, we're changing our strategy.

43:17.809 --> 43:21.521
It's better to work smart than work hard,
I always say.

43:21.604 --> 43:23.689
If the mother wants
to see her daughter again,

43:23.731 --> 43:25.483
she'll have to give me what I want.

43:25.525 --> 43:29.654
She's going to deliver the Colossus
right to us.

43:29.695 --> 43:32.365
I feel just like it's my birthday.

43:39.872 --> 43:40.998
So?

43:41.332 --> 43:42.708
He wasn't lying.

43:42.750 --> 43:45.670
They kidnapped her. It's all my fault.

43:46.963 --> 43:48.881
How could I have been so wrong?

43:48.923 --> 43:51.342
Don't beat yourself up.
We're going to find her.

43:51.384 --> 43:53.845
We'll start the search immediately.

43:53.928 --> 43:56.222
Be strong. Let's go!

44:10.695 --> 44:15.241
So, there you are, you filthy animal,
always haunting me.

44:15.324 --> 44:17.201
You're pathetic.

44:17.243 --> 44:20.163
You think you can rob me
of everything I love?

44:20.246 --> 44:23.457
Well, you're wrong. I'm going to end this!

44:29.005 --> 44:33.759
You see, I don't uncork champagne bottles.
I execute them.

44:34.093 --> 44:36.846
You truly are a great aim, boss.
That was a great shot!

44:36.929 --> 44:38.848
What do you think you're doing?
It's ladies first.

44:38.931 --> 44:40.600
Mind your manners, Mr. Frog.

44:41.017 --> 44:44.562
Come to think of it, a frog who
doesn't swim doesn't drink champagne.

44:44.604 --> 44:48.107
Now take the kid upstairs
and don't let her out of your sight! Got it?

44:48.149 --> 44:50.443
Come on. You heard the boss!

44:50.526 --> 44:53.446
Making yourself even more lovely, my pet?

44:53.487 --> 44:56.449
But of course, all for you, my big teddybear!

44:56.490 --> 44:57.700
What is she doing?

44:57.783 --> 44:59.368
Can I tell you a secret?

44:59.452 --> 45:02.622
- I really hate the way she smells.
- No kidding.

45:02.663 --> 45:04.999
I think she's trying to poison us all.

45:06.834 --> 45:11.047
Excuse me, boss, would you mind
if we opened the window a little?

45:11.130 --> 45:12.798
It's such a lovely evening.

45:12.882 --> 45:14.383
Suit yourself.

45:21.182 --> 45:23.935
- What's the matter with Hulot?
- It's nothing, boss.

45:23.976 --> 45:26.145
He just had too much champagne.

45:26.229 --> 45:29.315
You know what I think?
And I mean no offense.

45:29.440 --> 45:32.693
But sometimes, I wonder
if you were cut out to be gangsters at all.

45:44.789 --> 45:46.958
This is all well and good, Mr. Cat.

45:47.166 --> 45:50.002
But how you propose we find Zoé?

45:53.339 --> 45:56.342
What's gotten into you?

45:56.384 --> 45:58.719
Are you on to something?

45:58.803 --> 46:00.346
Hey! Wait for me!

46:00.805 --> 46:02.640
Where are you going?

46:17.613 --> 46:21.617
Once this job is behind us,
I'm taking you to Nairobi!

46:21.701 --> 46:23.202
My jelly belly!

46:23.244 --> 46:26.038
It'll be our honeymoon, angel face.

46:26.080 --> 46:30.167
I know a little hotel, deep in the jungle,
where we can be alone.

46:30.251 --> 46:33.462
It will be the most beautiful day of my life!

46:33.546 --> 46:36.465
Thanks for nothing, kid.

46:36.549 --> 46:41.012
You don't think I'd rather celebrate
than play babysitter here with you?

46:56.235 --> 46:58.904
What's that? Who did that?

46:58.988 --> 47:01.907
Can one of you ignoramuses
get the lights back on?

47:03.117 --> 47:06.370
Now I'm just like you, cat.
I can see in the dark.

47:06.412 --> 47:07.830
Maybe it's the fuses.

47:07.913 --> 47:09.790
- Or the breakers.
- Did anyone see any flashlights?

47:09.874 --> 47:12.585
I think I saw some in the basement.

47:12.668 --> 47:15.463
You stay here. I'll go find them.

47:23.721 --> 47:25.765
What's wrong, Mr. Hulot? Allergies?

47:25.848 --> 47:28.392
But no, not at all.
I thought it was you who...

47:28.434 --> 47:31.145
You think I don't hear
what you boys say about my perfume?

47:31.228 --> 47:34.607
Sure, when my man's around,
you've got nothing to say.

47:34.648 --> 47:36.776
But once he's gone, you all gossip!

47:36.817 --> 47:38.611
Now tell me what you think.

47:38.694 --> 47:40.237
- How do I smell?
- Smell?

47:40.279 --> 47:41.572
I don't know what you mean.

47:41.614 --> 47:44.742
It's a simple question, isn't it?
Do I smell good or not?

47:44.784 --> 47:46.494
What are you two going on about?

47:46.577 --> 47:49.455
Everybody shut up
until we get the lights back on!

47:50.373 --> 47:51.749
Serves them right.

47:51.791 --> 47:54.293
That will teach those jerks
to leave me out of the party.

47:54.460 --> 47:56.295
Now no one gets to drink any bubbly!

47:56.379 --> 47:58.923
If I can't have any, no one should.

47:59.924 --> 48:04.387
It's me, princess. It's Nico.
Now, let's get you out of here.

48:04.470 --> 48:07.014
What made him call me Frog?

48:07.098 --> 48:09.767
I don't like frogs.

48:09.809 --> 48:11.018
So what if I can't swim?

48:11.102 --> 48:15.064
I'd still like to enjoy some champagne
with my crew.

48:15.147 --> 48:18.275
The life of a gangster isn't an easy one.

48:18.317 --> 48:20.778
But it's what I know. It's my job.

48:21.946 --> 48:24.115
Before this, I was a dancer.

48:32.915 --> 48:34.708
Everybody, it's that man!

48:34.792 --> 48:36.877
He's here! He's got the girl!

48:36.961 --> 48:38.796
- I need backup!
- I'm coming!

48:38.838 --> 48:40.589
- I have him! I think I have him!
- I got him!

48:40.673 --> 48:41.841
- I got him!
- Don't let him go!

48:41.882 --> 48:42.925
Hold him down!

48:43.676 --> 48:46.178
- You're not him.
- And neither are you.

48:46.220 --> 48:48.848
- What now?
- On three, we let go.

48:48.931 --> 48:52.351
Look! Something there just moved.

48:53.686 --> 48:55.771
What are you doing? Stop yelling!

48:55.855 --> 48:58.983
One of you get the girl!
Don't let her get away!

48:59.066 --> 49:01.318
And someone get the lights back on!

49:05.698 --> 49:07.032
I'll do it myself.

49:10.453 --> 49:12.163
Hold on tight, Zoé!

49:22.506 --> 49:26.510
Yoo-hoo! Costa! Come on, then, jump!

49:26.552 --> 49:28.179
Or are you too afraid?

49:28.220 --> 49:30.764
I'll show you fear! Now!

49:43.903 --> 49:45.279
Look, on the roof!

49:46.071 --> 49:48.240
There's another one chasing him.

49:48.324 --> 49:50.242
And there's a little girl on his back.

50:38.082 --> 50:40.125
Did you see him? Was it Costa?

50:40.209 --> 50:42.294
Which way did he go? Answer me!

50:42.336 --> 50:45.798
Did you get a good look at him?
Was there a little girl with him?

50:45.881 --> 50:48.717
The guy's in pain. Here, let me handle this.

50:48.801 --> 50:50.803
Sir, are you positive it was Costa?

50:50.886 --> 50:53.556
It was Victor Costa, no doubt about it.

50:53.639 --> 50:56.684
He had a big guy with him.
He's a tough customer.

50:56.767 --> 50:58.060
Look what that brute did to my eye!

50:58.143 --> 50:59.562
- Yes, what?
- Sir, if you could just tell me

50:59.645 --> 51:00.854
-where you think they were heading?
- What?

51:00.938 --> 51:02.606
Lucas, they've spotted Costa.

51:02.648 --> 51:04.358
Come on, we don't have a minute to lose!

51:04.441 --> 51:08.571
Thank you very much
for your assistance in this matter. Take care!

51:13.075 --> 51:15.244
All right, you just stay put, Zoé.

51:15.327 --> 51:16.662
Promise me.

51:16.704 --> 51:18.205
I'll be back before you know it,

51:18.289 --> 51:21.417
but first I have to deal
with you know who, okay?

51:21.500 --> 51:23.168
It shouldn't take long.

51:29.049 --> 51:30.342
Look at that physique!

51:30.509 --> 51:33.929
Is that muscle or flab
in those thick, hairy arms of yours?

51:34.013 --> 51:35.472
You'll find out soon enough!

51:35.556 --> 51:38.100
Come on, get over here, I'm waiting for ya!

51:38.183 --> 51:40.853
That's funny.
I don't recall receiving an invitation.

51:40.894 --> 51:43.606
Well, it's your lucky day!
No invitation required!

51:43.689 --> 51:46.984
Is it a formal affair?
'Cause you just lost your shirt and tie.

51:47.026 --> 51:48.277
Serious faux pas.

51:48.360 --> 51:50.613
I didn't want to dirty them when I beat you.

51:50.696 --> 51:54.408
But how are you going to beat me
if you can't even catch me?

52:47.294 --> 52:49.922
It's not moving at all!
What are we going to do?

52:50.005 --> 52:51.507
This is not my lucky day.

52:51.590 --> 52:54.051
<i>Superintendent, we have news on Costa,
please respond.</i>

52:54.093 --> 52:55.135
What have you got?

52:55.219 --> 52:59.431
<i>Costa's been spotted but he's not alone.
There's another man, a child, and a cat.</i>

52:59.515 --> 53:02.893
- It's Zoé, I'm sure of it!
- So, what do we do now?

53:02.935 --> 53:05.104
Take the wheel, I'm going after her!

53:12.820 --> 53:14.905
Still up here, are you?

53:15.114 --> 53:16.532
Need a hand getting down?

53:16.615 --> 53:18.534
Or should I say a foot?

53:19.451 --> 53:21.537
You're going down!

53:23.288 --> 53:25.290
Way too short, old man.

53:25.332 --> 53:28.168
You know, I bet if you were taller,
you'd be a nicer person.

53:28.752 --> 53:30.421
You know what?

53:30.462 --> 53:33.173
I'm not waiting
for you to fall to mash you to a pulp.

53:33.298 --> 53:36.093
Love your jammy top.
Did your mom lay that out for you?

53:37.219 --> 53:40.222
How dare you insult my dear mother!

53:40.472 --> 53:41.515
Too short!

53:46.228 --> 53:47.938
That was close.

53:47.980 --> 53:50.065
Friends in high places!

53:50.149 --> 53:52.818
How about a kiss?

54:02.286 --> 54:04.955
Zoé, don't! Stay where you are.

54:06.123 --> 54:09.209
It's too dangerous.
There's nothing you can do for me.

54:09.293 --> 54:10.753
This thing won't hold much longer.

54:12.755 --> 54:14.840
I don't want you to fall.

54:38.363 --> 54:39.782
Are you okay?

54:41.325 --> 54:43.202
Since when do the police save thieves?

54:43.243 --> 54:45.454
Perhaps since thieves started saving kids.

54:45.537 --> 54:47.289
Perhaps. Could be.

54:48.165 --> 54:50.209
Hello, remember me?

54:50.459 --> 54:52.252
I've come to pay you a visit.

54:52.336 --> 54:56.089
In memory of your father. I knew him well.

54:56.173 --> 55:01.428
So, off we go and this time, no running
away from Uncle Costa, all right?

55:01.512 --> 55:02.971
Now, that's enough, come on!

55:03.055 --> 55:05.265
Your little adventure's come to an end.

55:06.725 --> 55:08.560
They'll never get me, you hear me?

55:08.644 --> 55:10.604
You'll never get me!

55:11.522 --> 55:13.565
Colossus, I'm coming!

55:16.109 --> 55:18.529
Get off me, you filthy beast!

55:20.280 --> 55:21.907
Alley-oop!

55:28.372 --> 55:31.416
It's over, Costa. You're under arrest.

55:31.500 --> 55:33.919
This game has gone on long enough.

55:34.002 --> 55:35.420
Catch this!

55:36.380 --> 55:37.965
Sorry about the tail, buddy!

55:38.048 --> 55:41.426
I'm going to finish the job I started
with your husband.

55:41.593 --> 55:42.761
- Mama!
- And when you see him,

55:42.845 --> 55:44.263
you can tell him hello from me.

55:44.763 --> 55:47.182
Because I'm your worst nightmare.

55:53.480 --> 55:56.483
That wasn't very nice! You'll pay for that.

55:56.567 --> 55:57.818
Look out!

56:03.657 --> 56:05.868
- He's too heavy. I can't hold on!
- Hang on, I'm here.

56:13.041 --> 56:14.793
What is he doing down there now?

56:14.835 --> 56:16.920
I think he's actually lost his mind.

56:16.962 --> 56:20.007
Look! Look! He's coming!

56:20.090 --> 56:21.800
It's coming!

56:56.668 --> 56:59.129
You'll never get me!

57:00.172 --> 57:03.216
It's over, Costa! Enough is enough!

57:03.508 --> 57:06.178
- So long, suckers!
- Costa!

57:06.511 --> 57:07.554
No!

57:22.027 --> 57:25.447
Everybody stay behind the line.
There's nothing else to see here!

57:25.530 --> 57:27.366
Let us do our jobs. Now go home.

57:27.741 --> 57:29.451
Mom, you wouldn't believe it!

57:29.534 --> 57:33.038
I was being chased, so I ran into the zoo
and then Dino led me into a boat,

57:33.121 --> 57:35.415
because the bad guy from the picture
was about to catch me.

57:35.499 --> 57:36.875
But he couldn't swim.

57:36.959 --> 57:39.503
But first, Claudine,
she was with the bad people.

57:39.544 --> 57:41.713
I think that's when I was most scared,
but it was okay,

57:41.755 --> 57:44.007
because when the bad guy
who couldn't swim tried to catch me,

57:44.049 --> 57:47.719
that's when Dino gave him a big scratch
on his hand and he nearly drowned!

57:49.805 --> 57:51.848
Then they took me back to a big house.

57:51.890 --> 57:54.559
I didn't know what to do,
but just then, everything went dark

57:54.643 --> 57:57.104
and that's when they rescued me!

57:59.398 --> 58:00.607
Hey?

58:00.691 --> 58:02.067
Are you listening to me?

58:02.651 --> 58:05.404
Don't you want to hear my story?

58:05.487 --> 58:07.614
Of course, Zoé!

58:07.698 --> 58:10.075
This time it really is all over.

58:10.117 --> 58:11.618
Let's go home.
