03:36.131 --> 03:38.431
Hey.

03:39.630 --> 03:41.331
This is the part where you say,

03:41.366 --> 03:43.765
"Bless me, Father, for I have sinned."

03:46.366 --> 03:47.366
Yes.

03:49.997 --> 03:51.898
How long since your last confession?

03:51.931 --> 03:54.899
I've, actually, uh...

03:54.930 --> 03:58.398
I've never had a confession before.

03:58.430 --> 04:00.930
You've never had the
Sacrament of Reconciliation?

04:00.964 --> 04:04.597
No, I've never had any sacraments

04:04.630 --> 04:06.698
that I can think of,
not that I can remember.

04:06.731 --> 04:09.066
I mean, I may have had one by accident.

04:09.097 --> 04:11.065
To tell you the truth, I
actually never even been

04:11.097 --> 04:13.030
inside of one of these, or
like a church or anything,

04:13.065 --> 04:15.598
but there was a funeral... I'm sorry.

04:18.365 --> 04:21.498
I didn't know who else to talk to.

04:21.531 --> 04:23.632
You're the deputy from that Oswalt thing.

04:23.664 --> 04:27.098
Well... I'm not on the force anymore.

04:27.131 --> 04:29.931
But you are him, right?

04:29.964 --> 04:31.464
Yeah.

04:34.631 --> 04:37.098
So...

04:37.131 --> 04:39.398
if I... if I tell you something,

04:39.430 --> 04:41.631
it stays between us, right, like lawyers?

04:41.665 --> 04:44.597
Yeah, but I'm gonna ask
you not to tell me anything

04:44.631 --> 04:47.831
that I can't unhear,
if you know what I mean.

04:47.864 --> 04:50.332
Okay.

04:50.365 --> 04:52.865
Do you believe in evil?

04:52.897 --> 04:55.066
I mean, of course you do, you know.

04:55.098 --> 04:58.631
You mean, do I believe in the supernatural?

04:58.665 --> 05:02.031
Ghosts and demons, and the devil himself.

05:02.064 --> 05:05.564
Something like that, yeah.

05:05.598 --> 05:08.532
This is about your friend, your case.

05:10.465 --> 05:11.865
What did you find?

05:11.897 --> 05:14.597
I don't know, I can't explain it.

05:14.630 --> 05:17.331
It's something, uh...

05:18.731 --> 05:20.598
otherworldly.

05:20.631 --> 05:23.066
And you want to know how to stop it.

05:23.097 --> 05:25.497
Yes.

05:25.530 --> 05:27.564
What do you want me to say?

05:27.598 --> 05:29.798
You should carry a cross and holy water,

05:29.830 --> 05:33.532
and shout, "The power
of Christ compels you?"

05:33.565 --> 05:35.365
Why, would that work?

05:35.397 --> 05:37.364
No.

05:37.398 --> 05:38.966
Right.

05:40.431 --> 05:42.597
- You want my professional advice?
- Yes.

05:42.630 --> 05:44.731
You don't stop evil.

05:44.764 --> 05:47.664
You can only protect yourself from it.

05:47.698 --> 05:49.665
Do I believe things that
you're talking about exist?

05:49.698 --> 05:51.332
Yes.

05:51.365 --> 05:54.998
And I believe they exist to
lure men like you into them.

05:55.031 --> 05:58.065
Stay out of it, whatever it is.

06:02.798 --> 06:04.432
Whatever happened to the Oswalts

06:04.465 --> 06:05.898
is only gonna happen again.

06:08.830 --> 06:11.030
It's a question of when and where.

06:43.664 --> 06:46.497
Gotcha!

06:46.531 --> 06:48.998
- What?
- You didn't make the noise. You didn't say the words.

06:49.030 --> 06:50.964
- No, I killed you.
- I shot you in the back.

06:50.997 --> 06:52.831
- You're hit. I got you!
- Uh-uh.

06:52.864 --> 06:54.864
No, I got you, I killed you!

06:54.897 --> 06:56.531
You did not make the noise.

06:56.564 --> 06:59.597
Boys. Boys!

06:59.630 --> 07:02.031
Did you guys take those
out of their packages?

07:02.064 --> 07:04.731
No. They were in a bin like this.

07:04.765 --> 07:05.898
You're putting 'em back.

07:09.431 --> 07:11.030
Pick out your cereal.

07:18.497 --> 07:20.698
Dude, these are so much better than yours.

07:20.731 --> 07:21.799
Yeah, but these are healthy.

07:21.831 --> 07:23.097
You're supposed to pick sugar,

07:23.131 --> 07:24.766
that's the whole point of cereal.

07:31.430 --> 07:32.998
No, no. One box each.

07:33.030 --> 07:35.730
- They all look so good.
- Can we get two each?

07:35.765 --> 07:37.432
No.

07:38.565 --> 07:40.931
You boys stay close, okay?

07:40.965 --> 07:42.965
Okay.

08:03.830 --> 08:06.665
What is it, Mom?

08:06.698 --> 08:07.998
You boys remember what to do

08:08.030 --> 08:09.898
when Mama says "rutabaga", right?

08:09.930 --> 08:11.830
We run.

08:11.864 --> 08:13.931
Yeah, and stay close together.

08:23.764 --> 08:24.730
Rutabaga.

08:24.765 --> 08:27.299
Rutabaga!

08:35.964 --> 08:37.364
- Oh, my God!
- Hey, hey!

08:37.398 --> 08:39.397
Wait, wait a minute. Slow down!

08:39.429 --> 08:40.731
- Dylan!
- What's wrong?

08:40.765 --> 08:43.698
That man back there just
touched one of my boys.

08:43.731 --> 08:47.498
Hey, son. You need to step back.

08:47.530 --> 08:49.299
What'd she tell you?

08:57.629 --> 08:58.597
Seatbelts.

08:58.630 --> 08:59.665
Yeah.

09:06.697 --> 09:08.766
Yeah, it's her, all right.

09:22.930 --> 09:24.332
Race you inside.

09:24.365 --> 09:25.830
What?

09:31.065 --> 09:32.931
Dylan?

09:34.564 --> 09:35.564
You okay?

09:38.996 --> 09:40.331
What is it?

09:44.897 --> 09:47.398
Okay, well, I think I'm gonna
go finish up work for a bit.

09:47.429 --> 09:49.331
You think you can make
dinner with your brother?

09:51.031 --> 09:52.564
Okay.

09:52.597 --> 09:54.431
Hey.

09:54.465 --> 09:56.031
You did good today.

10:10.530 --> 10:13.965
Yeah, hi, I'm calling
about the Jacobs property.

10:13.997 --> 10:15.698
Yeah, I'm looking at the listing.

10:15.731 --> 10:18.598
Uh, is it still available?

10:18.629 --> 10:20.397
Oh, it is.

10:20.429 --> 10:21.930
Okay. No, that's great.

10:21.964 --> 10:26.030
My clients are gonna be
very, very happy about that.

10:26.062 --> 10:29.864
Yes, they, um... they
are aware of the incident.

10:29.896 --> 10:32.097
Yeah, their only question is

10:32.130 --> 10:34.897
has anyone lived on
the property since then?

10:36.865 --> 10:38.465
No one.

10:41.430 --> 10:44.031
It's been vacant for that long?

10:44.064 --> 10:46.565
Okay. No, no, I'll, um...

10:46.597 --> 10:48.097
I'll let them know.

10:48.131 --> 10:49.898
Okay, thanks.

12:19.098 --> 12:20.530
Mom.

12:20.565 --> 12:22.365
Yeah, sweetie?

12:23.629 --> 12:26.097
- Dinner.
- Okay.

12:26.131 --> 12:27.612
I'll be... I'll be there in a minute.

12:32.130 --> 12:33.130
Dylan?

12:36.429 --> 12:38.564
You okay, baby? What's wrong?

12:41.629 --> 12:42.665
Nothing.

12:44.831 --> 12:48.065
Hey, Dylan. It's just
an old building, baby.

12:55.497 --> 12:57.964
I know.

13:07.997 --> 13:10.065
How long are we gonna be out here?

13:10.097 --> 13:14.331
Not long. I promise.

13:14.365 --> 13:16.665
I'm worried about Dylan.

13:16.696 --> 13:18.430
Why?

13:18.464 --> 13:20.830
He's just...

13:20.864 --> 13:22.430
different out here.

13:24.629 --> 13:26.031
Yeah, well...

13:26.064 --> 13:29.431
he'll come around. He will.

13:29.465 --> 13:31.765
But he's gonna need a
little help from his brother.

13:31.796 --> 13:34.564
Do you think you're up for it?

13:36.597 --> 13:37.931
Good.

13:39.764 --> 13:43.365
'Cause I really can't do this alone.

13:43.398 --> 13:45.565
I need my boys.

13:45.597 --> 13:47.698
Good night.

13:47.731 --> 13:49.698
Sweet dreams.

14:13.664 --> 14:16.564
- Hi, Milo.
- Hi, Dylan.

14:16.597 --> 14:18.531
What are you doing here?

14:18.565 --> 14:20.098
I have something to show you.

14:20.130 --> 14:22.465
I'm supposed to be asleep.

14:23.764 --> 14:25.797
Your mom just started working.

14:25.831 --> 14:28.698
She'll be out there for hours.

14:28.730 --> 14:30.430
What if she comes back?

14:31.962 --> 14:33.697
She won't.

14:33.730 --> 14:36.697
- How do you know?
- I just know.

14:36.730 --> 14:39.330
Do you trust me?

14:59.064 --> 15:00.964
What's down there?

15:00.996 --> 15:02.830
You'll see.

15:14.731 --> 15:16.631
It's back there.

15:20.763 --> 15:22.598
Come on.

15:33.831 --> 15:35.965
Should I open it?

15:51.763 --> 15:52.897
What's on them?

15:52.930 --> 15:55.665
There's only one way to find out.

16:01.896 --> 16:03.530
How'd you know this was here?

16:05.396 --> 16:06.897
This is where I left it.

16:28.897 --> 16:31.764
Hey, Ted. What are you doing here?

16:31.797 --> 16:34.865
Milo said he was gonna show you the thing.

16:41.629 --> 16:43.698
This one's mine.

18:25.396 --> 18:26.930
We shouldn't be watching this.

18:26.963 --> 18:29.364
Turn it off, Milo. Let's get...

18:29.397 --> 18:30.531
Shh.

19:45.564 --> 19:47.863
What the hell?

19:52.597 --> 19:53.998
Uh...

19:54.029 --> 19:55.998
Mom!

19:56.029 --> 19:57.765
Mom!

20:01.864 --> 20:04.497
- Hey!
- Whoa, hold on, ma'am.

20:04.529 --> 20:06.331
No, no, no. This is private property.

20:06.364 --> 20:08.097
Wait, wait, wait! No, I was
told the house was for sale.

20:08.129 --> 20:09.664
The listing said it was available.

20:09.696 --> 20:11.563
Doesn't give you a right to be out here.

20:11.597 --> 20:13.564
You're trespassing and you know
it. What are you doing here?

20:13.596 --> 20:15.564
I'm a private investigator.

20:15.596 --> 20:18.596
- Oh, you son of a bitch.
- What?

20:18.629 --> 20:21.431
- How the fuck did you find me?
- Hold on, what?

20:21.463 --> 20:23.463
Was that your partner back
there at the grocery store?

20:23.497 --> 20:24.964
Partner? No, I work alone.

20:24.997 --> 20:27.064
You listen to me, okay? You listen to me.

20:27.097 --> 20:29.065
- Okay.
- You are not taking them.

20:29.097 --> 20:31.830
He is not taking them,
do you understand me?

20:31.864 --> 20:33.998
- Okay.
- I don't care who his friends are.

20:34.029 --> 20:36.331
- Okay?
- Okay, yeah.

20:36.364 --> 20:38.663
Good, okay.

20:43.764 --> 20:46.331
Okay, you look like a reasonable man.

20:46.364 --> 20:48.029
You do. Are you a reasonable man?

20:48.063 --> 20:49.997
Um...

20:50.030 --> 20:51.596
I mean, yeah, I guess.

20:51.630 --> 20:53.864
What's it gonna take?

20:53.896 --> 20:56.029
I mean...

20:56.063 --> 20:59.463
What is he paying you?

21:00.930 --> 21:02.497
I don't have a lot, but I...

21:02.529 --> 21:03.963
I will pay you what I have

21:03.997 --> 21:06.630
to make sure that you never saw us, okay?

21:08.629 --> 21:10.730
So just tell me what it's gonna take.

21:13.397 --> 21:14.364
Coffee.

21:14.397 --> 21:15.764
Excuse me?

21:15.796 --> 21:18.797
A cup of coffee. It's
been a really long trip,

21:18.829 --> 21:21.463
and I think that there has
been a huge misunderstanding.

21:28.997 --> 21:30.998
Um... have you ever heard

21:31.029 --> 21:33.963
of someone named Ellison Oswalt?

21:33.996 --> 21:36.064
Yeah. Yeah, who hasn't heard about that.

21:36.097 --> 21:37.531
That was terrible what happened.

21:37.563 --> 21:38.897
Mr. Oswalt was a friend of mine.

21:38.930 --> 21:40.663
I was helping him on his
book that he was writing

21:40.697 --> 21:42.664
- about the case...
- Oh, so...

21:42.697 --> 21:45.531
Are you here 'cause of
what happened at the church?

21:45.563 --> 21:46.630
Yes, ma'am.

21:46.664 --> 21:48.463
You think they're related?

21:48.497 --> 21:49.964
No, they...

21:49.997 --> 21:51.863
The crimes share a lot of similarities.

21:51.897 --> 21:54.664
I'm just following up on
cold cases that look similar.

21:54.696 --> 21:56.763
Hmm. How's there any money in that?

21:56.797 --> 21:59.030
There's not, really.

21:59.064 --> 22:01.864
But fortunately, there's always somebody

22:01.897 --> 22:03.730
that needs a private detective

22:03.764 --> 22:05.930
to check in on a spouse or an employee,

22:05.964 --> 22:08.029
- so when I'm not doing that...
- You do this.

22:08.064 --> 22:09.631
Yeah.

22:10.764 --> 22:12.364
Uh...

22:14.464 --> 22:17.431
Have you ever seen
anything on your property

22:17.463 --> 22:18.829
that looks like this?

22:24.030 --> 22:25.730
No.

22:30.697 --> 22:34.431
Mmm. You weren't supposed to be here.

22:34.464 --> 22:36.497
I was told that this place was empty.

22:36.529 --> 22:39.029
Right. My friend Jillian,
her dad owns the land now,

22:39.064 --> 22:41.531
and when things between my
husband and I went south,

22:41.562 --> 22:43.363
she was nice enough to put us up here,

22:43.397 --> 22:46.330
but she told me that
nobody ever comes out here.

22:48.096 --> 22:50.029
Oh, so... So the boys, is that...

22:50.064 --> 22:51.697
Do you have legal custody, or is that...

22:51.729 --> 22:54.029
I do, yes. It's, uh...

22:54.062 --> 22:55.863
It's temporary, though.

22:55.896 --> 22:57.630
Well, look, you...

22:57.662 --> 22:59.764
You're welcome to stay
awhile and look around,

22:59.796 --> 23:03.597
- whatever you need.
- No, it's getting late.

23:03.629 --> 23:06.763
You don't want to creep around
a murder scene in the dark, huh?

23:06.797 --> 23:08.630
No, ma'am.

23:08.663 --> 23:10.496
In all honesty, I do not.

23:10.530 --> 23:13.664
- It's Courtney.
- Okay, Courtney.

23:13.696 --> 23:15.562
Do you mind if I come back here tomorrow

23:15.596 --> 23:16.564
and have a look around?

23:16.596 --> 23:18.963
No, but on one condition.

23:18.996 --> 23:21.497
- Anything.
- Nobody gets to know that we're here.

23:22.930 --> 23:23.965
No one.

23:25.096 --> 23:26.596
I don't know who I'd tell.

23:26.629 --> 23:28.464
Good.

23:43.864 --> 23:46.698
Goddamn it. Damn it!

23:49.496 --> 23:51.996
<i>Karen! Karen?</i>

23:58.597 --> 24:00.930
Boys, let's, uh...

24:00.964 --> 24:02.463
Let's get ready for bed.

24:03.529 --> 24:04.897
Brush your teeth.

24:04.930 --> 24:06.764
Can we just watch till the next commercial?

24:06.796 --> 24:09.729
- No, now.
- Come on!

24:09.763 --> 24:11.097
I don't like it when you boys

24:11.129 --> 24:12.863
watch stuff like that before bed, okay?

24:12.896 --> 24:15.029
It's not real, Mom. It's
okay if it's not real.

24:15.064 --> 24:16.630
Yeah, but it'll still give you nightmares.

24:16.662 --> 24:17.729
So let's go, come on.

24:17.764 --> 24:20.763
Brush your teeth.

24:20.797 --> 24:22.596
What did that man want today?

24:22.628 --> 24:24.431
- Uh...
- Was he one of Daddy's friends?

24:24.462 --> 24:27.562
No, no, no. He was just
looking for something.

24:27.597 --> 24:30.364
Was he here about
what happened in the church?

24:30.396 --> 24:32.829
What do you mean what
happened in the church?

24:32.864 --> 24:34.564
We know about the church, Mom.

24:34.596 --> 24:36.530
We're not stupid.

24:43.564 --> 24:46.397
Hey, who told you two about
what happened in the church?

24:46.429 --> 24:48.597
We just heard about it.

24:48.628 --> 24:50.097
Yeah, everyone knows.

24:50.129 --> 24:51.763
All right, well, I don't want you two

24:51.797 --> 24:53.596
thinking about that, okay?

24:53.629 --> 24:57.498
Dylan? Is that why you're
afraid of the church, baby?

24:59.763 --> 25:01.662
You don't have to worry about that, okay?

25:01.696 --> 25:03.616
There's nothing in that
church that can hurt you.

25:05.929 --> 25:07.430
Hey! Hey, you guys.

25:07.464 --> 25:09.364
Hey, hey, okay, okay.

25:09.396 --> 25:11.997
Okay, okay, come on.
Brush your teeth, let's go.

25:12.029 --> 25:14.030
What happened in the church?

25:33.629 --> 25:35.562
What?

25:35.597 --> 25:37.498
What the...

25:40.564 --> 25:42.363
What...

25:45.964 --> 25:48.364
What?

26:34.628 --> 26:38.029
Come on. Let's watch another.

26:38.064 --> 26:41.430
No, I don't want to watch any more of them.

28:10.929 --> 28:11.929
Hi, Emma.

28:14.629 --> 28:17.397
Are you having the dreams?

28:17.428 --> 28:18.796
We all had the dreams.

28:18.830 --> 28:21.696
The movies make the dreams go away.

28:21.730 --> 28:23.497
Once you watch them all,

28:23.528 --> 28:25.463
you never have a bad dream again.

28:25.497 --> 28:26.662
For real?

28:26.696 --> 28:28.797
Swear.

29:54.729 --> 29:56.929
Let's watch another.

29:59.595 --> 30:01.564
No. I don't wanna watch any more movies.

30:01.595 --> 30:03.496
But you have to.

30:03.529 --> 30:05.030
You haven't watched the best ones yet.

30:05.061 --> 30:08.829
Besides, you won't have
any more bad dreams tonight.

30:08.864 --> 30:10.697
Or tomorrow if you watch another.

30:13.063 --> 30:15.364
Good night, Milo.

30:29.497 --> 30:30.997
You aren't so special, you know.

30:31.029 --> 30:33.496
- What?
- I can see them too.

30:33.529 --> 30:35.730
You aren't so special.

30:38.729 --> 30:41.564
Aren't you gonna say anything?

30:44.730 --> 30:48.729
Hey, answer me. Pussy.

30:48.764 --> 30:50.730
Zachary Collins, what did
you just call your brother?

30:50.764 --> 30:52.530
- Nothing.
- Don't you tell me "nothing".

30:56.596 --> 30:57.829
Okay, remember what I told you boys?

30:57.863 --> 30:59.564
Speak only when spoken to,

30:59.595 --> 31:01.765
and tell you what he asks us.

31:13.562 --> 31:15.463
So here it is.

31:17.029 --> 31:18.961
The scene of the crime.

31:18.996 --> 31:20.963
So how were they killed? Do you know?

31:20.995 --> 31:22.763
Unfortunately, I do.

31:22.795 --> 31:24.696
Tell me.

31:26.096 --> 31:28.496
Trust me, you don't want to know.

31:30.529 --> 31:32.496
Uh...

31:32.529 --> 31:34.463
I'm gonna look around in
here for a few minutes.

31:34.496 --> 31:37.064
I'm gonna compare the space to
some of the crime scene photos.

31:37.096 --> 31:39.330
Yeah, sure. Uh, please.

31:39.363 --> 31:40.996
Come back to the house
if you have any questions.

31:41.030 --> 31:42.896
I will.

31:42.930 --> 31:43.930
Thanks.

31:48.062 --> 31:50.298
Okay.

34:16.496 --> 34:18.429
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

34:19.762 --> 34:21.697
Oh.

35:10.097 --> 35:12.697
Come on.

35:17.562 --> 35:19.063
What?

35:27.061 --> 35:30.495
Oh!

35:30.529 --> 35:32.530
Hello?

35:32.563 --> 35:35.097
- Deputy?
- <i>Well, I'm not really on the force anymore.</i>

35:35.129 --> 35:37.730
No, right. Of course, I'm sorry.

35:37.762 --> 35:39.429
<i>Who is this?</i>

35:39.462 --> 35:42.429
I'm Dr. Stromberg. We
spoke a few months back.

35:42.464 --> 35:44.729
<i>You're like, the new
Professor Jonas or something?</i>

35:44.763 --> 35:46.730
God, I hope not.

35:46.763 --> 35:48.562
Jonas is missing.

35:48.596 --> 35:51.797
<i>The police
just called off the search.</i>

35:51.830 --> 35:54.396
Well, what happened to him?

35:54.429 --> 35:55.797
<i>Look, I need you to, uh...</i>

35:55.830 --> 35:57.596
<i>to come out here as
soon as possible.</i>

35:57.629 --> 36:00.595
Uh, I'm a little tied up
with something right now.

36:00.629 --> 36:03.997
Look, Jonas left...

36:04.029 --> 36:08.496
he left something behind.
Something unbelievable.

36:08.529 --> 36:10.530
<i>I think it could be
the key to all of this.</i>

36:10.563 --> 36:12.029
Then tell me.

36:12.061 --> 36:14.896
No. No, no, no. I can't-I can't risk that.

36:14.928 --> 36:17.796
- Not on the phone.
- Okay.

36:17.830 --> 36:19.663
- I'll be there tomorrow.
- <i>Yeah, okay, that's good.</i>

36:19.696 --> 36:21.529
<i>Great, thank you.</i>

37:06.462 --> 37:07.696
Hey.

37:12.496 --> 37:14.430
Dylan, right?

37:18.763 --> 37:22.064
How do you like it out here?

37:22.097 --> 37:23.463
Be better if I didn't live

37:23.496 --> 37:25.630
where so many people got killed.

37:29.462 --> 37:31.729
So how you dealing with that?

37:34.963 --> 37:36.729
I get it.

37:36.761 --> 37:39.696
I'd be scared too.

37:39.730 --> 37:42.561
And I'd have nightmares
in a place like this.

37:45.128 --> 37:46.863
You having nightmares?

37:48.663 --> 37:50.863
Yeah.

37:50.896 --> 37:54.730
Yeah, I have really bad
dreams too sometimes.

37:54.761 --> 37:56.862
About dead people?

37:59.861 --> 38:01.663
A friend.

38:05.364 --> 38:06.797
What do you do?

38:06.828 --> 38:08.663
To stop the dreams.

38:10.396 --> 38:14.797
Well, when I'm awake, I try to help people.

38:14.828 --> 38:18.828
You know, make the real world
a little less like the dreams.

38:22.129 --> 38:23.963
You let me know if the dreams start to feel

38:23.995 --> 38:25.796
a little too real, you know?

38:27.929 --> 38:30.530
I'm pretty good at dealing with nightmares.

38:38.395 --> 38:39.996
Oh, no.

38:53.128 --> 38:54.463
You cut your hair.

38:54.495 --> 38:56.395
Bastard.

38:56.428 --> 38:57.797
How dare you show up here?

39:01.495 --> 39:03.929
What the fuck is this?

39:03.963 --> 39:06.963
I told you this would happen.
Told you I'd come for 'em.

39:06.996 --> 39:09.996
No, no, this is bullshit.
You don't have a court order.

39:10.028 --> 39:11.796
- You can't do this.
- Step aside, ma'am.

39:11.829 --> 39:14.629
You need a court order.
Boys, get back in the house!

39:14.661 --> 39:16.028
- Step aside.
- Get back.

39:16.063 --> 39:17.797
- Ma'am...
- No, you can't do this!

39:17.828 --> 39:19.928
- You need to step...
- Let's see the order.

39:19.963 --> 39:23.029
Step aside, sir. Now.

39:23.062 --> 39:24.530
Who's the officer in charge?

39:24.562 --> 39:26.064
I'm in charge, asshole.

39:26.095 --> 39:28.463
Okay, okay, Officer...

39:28.496 --> 39:30.530
Shermer. Where's the sheriff?

39:30.561 --> 39:32.595
We're state troopers.
We don't have a sheriff.

39:32.629 --> 39:34.897
- Now if you could...
- I know, I know. I can read the car.

39:34.929 --> 39:36.430
I know that you're state troopers.

39:36.461 --> 39:39.761
But I also know that
child custody transfers

39:39.796 --> 39:41.463
is the responsibility of the sheriff.

39:41.495 --> 39:43.696
And I can tell you from experience

39:43.728 --> 39:45.796
that the only reasons that
the sheriff isn't here today

39:45.829 --> 39:47.530
is because he either doesn't know about it,

39:47.561 --> 39:48.961
or he doesn't want to know.

39:48.995 --> 39:51.461
So, you want to call him? You know what?

39:51.496 --> 39:53.463
I'll call, I got it. Don't worry about it.

39:53.496 --> 39:54.863
Sir, put the phone away
or I'm gonna throw you

39:54.895 --> 39:56.763
in the back of the car myself.

39:56.796 --> 39:58.629
Are you saying that you'd arrest me?

39:58.662 --> 40:01.596
In a heartbeat.

40:01.629 --> 40:04.863
Well, then I should probably inform you

40:04.896 --> 40:08.797
that I was arrested a few years
ago on a big capital offense.

40:08.828 --> 40:12.595
It was a major news story.
All the charges were dropped.

40:12.629 --> 40:15.028
But if I were to be arrested again,

40:15.061 --> 40:18.728
that'd be pretty big news. Yeah.

40:18.763 --> 40:21.463
Whew! If the press got a hold of it...

40:21.495 --> 40:25.095
Ugh. I would hate to be the uniform

40:25.129 --> 40:27.729
that was trying to make a child abduction

40:27.763 --> 40:33.363
look like a custody transfer.
State cars and everything?

40:33.396 --> 40:36.361
That just might be the
worst day of that guy's life.

40:36.395 --> 40:37.395
Sir.

40:42.396 --> 40:44.530
- Let's go.
- Gary? Hey.

40:44.563 --> 40:46.095
I'm not leaving without my boys.

40:46.128 --> 40:48.561
Look, that douche canoe
over there is right.

40:48.595 --> 40:50.696
We don't have any legal
authority to be here.

40:50.728 --> 40:52.761
He called our bluff.

40:52.796 --> 40:54.663
I'm sorry, I can't lose my job over this.

40:54.696 --> 40:55.696
I got kids too.

41:02.429 --> 41:04.362
This isn't over.

41:04.396 --> 41:05.396
Whore.

41:21.628 --> 41:23.729
Thank you.

41:23.763 --> 41:26.028
Thank you so much for doing that.

41:26.061 --> 41:30.429
It's, uh... it's really no problem.

41:30.461 --> 41:31.595
We gotta get outta here.

41:31.627 --> 41:33.761
What? No, no... No.

41:33.796 --> 41:35.496
- No, no, you, um...
- What?

41:35.528 --> 41:37.028
You can't leave.

41:37.063 --> 41:40.629
- Why?
- Uh, did you, um...

41:40.663 --> 41:43.062
Did you have a restraining order?

41:43.096 --> 41:44.896
No. No.

41:44.929 --> 41:46.829
He had too many character witnesses.

41:46.863 --> 41:47.996
I was lucky I got custody.

41:48.028 --> 41:50.595
You have to stay because those officers

41:50.628 --> 41:52.663
can testify that they saw you here today,

41:52.696 --> 41:56.361
and if you leave overnight, then...

41:56.395 --> 41:58.529
he will have a case that
you're a flight risk.

41:59.929 --> 42:01.596
And he could get the boys.

42:01.628 --> 42:03.829
Yeah. Yeah, he could.

42:06.696 --> 42:08.629
But you saw him.

42:08.661 --> 42:10.496
He'll come back.

42:12.961 --> 42:14.063
Will you stay?

42:16.795 --> 42:19.461
Maybe just... for dinner?

42:20.962 --> 42:22.664
Sure.

42:40.429 --> 42:41.829
Sorry, I, uh...

42:42.895 --> 42:44.962
They're used to...

42:44.994 --> 42:46.595
Clint always ate first.

42:46.628 --> 42:49.595
Well, I'm not Clint, so go ahead, eat.

42:54.928 --> 42:58.828
So, were you a cop or something?

42:58.861 --> 43:00.595
Oh, yeah.

43:00.627 --> 43:02.528
A sheriff's deputy.

43:02.561 --> 43:03.861
So you saw dead bodies and stuff?

43:03.894 --> 43:05.596
- Zachary.
- What?

43:05.627 --> 43:06.961
Cops see dead bodies.

43:06.994 --> 43:09.395
That's okay. Um... Yeah, I did.

43:09.429 --> 43:10.995
More than I'd like.

43:11.028 --> 43:13.628
- Did you catch...
- Did you catch a lot of bad guys?

43:13.661 --> 43:18.629
Uh, not bad guys. Just people.

43:18.661 --> 43:20.862
Having bad days.

43:20.895 --> 43:23.029
But you're not a cop anymore.

43:23.061 --> 43:24.996
- No.
- Why not?

43:25.029 --> 43:27.529
Uh...

43:27.563 --> 43:30.796
Because I got tired of seeing
people on their bad days.

43:32.762 --> 43:34.329
I think you're good at dealing with people

43:34.361 --> 43:36.928
on their bad days.

43:36.963 --> 43:38.397
Thanks.

43:55.063 --> 43:56.862
Uh, thanks. Thanks for dinner.

43:56.895 --> 43:58.596
You don't have to leave.

43:58.627 --> 44:01.028
No, I... I have a really
long drive in the morning,

44:01.061 --> 44:04.095
and it's... it's dark.

44:04.129 --> 44:06.461
Does this place really spook you that much?

44:06.495 --> 44:08.795
No, it's not like that.

44:08.829 --> 44:11.362
Yes, it really does.

44:11.396 --> 44:13.696
It's really no problem.
I can fix up the couch.

44:13.728 --> 44:16.296
- No...
- Please stay.

44:33.696 --> 44:35.429
Oh, shi...

44:42.994 --> 44:45.329
What the hell am I doing here?

45:27.628 --> 45:29.829
Jesus Christ.

45:36.095 --> 45:37.395
You can't sleep, huh?

45:42.829 --> 45:43.862
No.

45:45.527 --> 45:47.529
Do you smoke?

45:47.561 --> 45:49.929
Uh... no.

45:49.961 --> 45:53.329
Not really, um... This
is a secret cigarette,

45:53.361 --> 45:55.496
- 'cause I'm a secret smoker.
- Gotcha.

45:55.528 --> 45:56.863
You can't say anything to my boys.

45:56.895 --> 45:58.495
They don't know.

45:58.527 --> 46:01.661
Okay, sure. I don't know when I would.

46:01.694 --> 46:04.361
I'm not their dad. That's weird.

46:04.395 --> 46:06.329
That is weird.

46:06.361 --> 46:07.929
Don't say that.

46:07.961 --> 46:10.361
It's like, oh, well, I wish you were.

46:16.661 --> 46:19.028
Was that true today what you said earlier,

46:19.060 --> 46:20.561
about getting arrested?

46:22.596 --> 46:24.496
Yeah. It's true.

46:24.528 --> 46:27.729
You didn't do it... did you?

46:27.763 --> 46:31.096
No, no. God, no. No,
it's nothing like that.

46:32.862 --> 46:34.961
That writer I was telling
you about, Ellison Oswalt.

46:34.994 --> 46:36.561
He's a friend of mine.

46:36.595 --> 46:38.395
I gave him some files and some information,

46:38.427 --> 46:40.395
even after my boss told me not to.

46:40.427 --> 46:42.395
And since I was the last
person to talk to him,

46:42.428 --> 46:44.729
and the only other person
they saw coming and going

46:44.763 --> 46:47.763
from his home, I was a really easy suspect.

46:47.795 --> 46:49.496
I was cleared of all the charges.

46:49.528 --> 46:51.629
Your boss was pissed 'cause
you went behind his back.

46:51.662 --> 46:53.595
Yeah. Yeah.

46:53.628 --> 46:55.496
Fired me the day that I was cleared.

46:58.096 --> 47:00.929
You miss it, huh?

47:00.960 --> 47:03.529
Most days.

47:03.561 --> 47:05.961
- Yeah, I do.
- Mmm.

47:08.463 --> 47:10.029
Can I ask you something?

47:10.060 --> 47:11.995
Sure.

47:12.028 --> 47:13.361
Ask away.

47:15.496 --> 47:16.496
Was it Dylan?

47:16.527 --> 47:18.296
What do you mean?

47:20.695 --> 47:22.528
That he hit.

47:26.128 --> 47:27.396
How could you tell?

47:29.929 --> 47:31.995
It's just that he reminds me of me.

47:34.763 --> 47:37.562
Clint beat him real bad.

47:37.594 --> 47:39.861
He sent him to the emergency room.

47:43.795 --> 47:45.595
All his cop buddies
weren't gonna do anything.

47:45.628 --> 47:47.562
So you left.

47:49.695 --> 47:50.695
Yeah.

47:52.495 --> 47:54.861
So what's the plan?

47:54.894 --> 47:57.696
Uh... get the hell out of here.

47:59.761 --> 48:02.095
Know where you're gonna go?

48:02.128 --> 48:04.297
Far as I can.

48:06.594 --> 48:08.328
What are you gonna do?

48:08.362 --> 48:09.763
Get a job, I guess.

48:09.794 --> 48:12.594
- Yeah, furniture stuff?
- Yeah.

48:12.628 --> 48:14.461
- Yeah, I saw inside the church.
- Yeah.

48:14.495 --> 48:15.861
- It's really cool.
- Thank you.

48:15.895 --> 48:19.729
It's antique restoration, actually.

48:19.761 --> 48:23.495
It feels almost magical
to turn something worn out

48:23.527 --> 48:25.761
into something that's...

48:25.795 --> 48:27.829
something that's beautiful again, you know?

48:27.860 --> 48:32.395
Like, polished and worthwhile.

48:32.427 --> 48:36.628
Something that's gonna be
here long after you're gone.

48:36.663 --> 48:38.629
Yeah.

48:38.663 --> 48:39.663
Like kids.

48:42.995 --> 48:45.029
Yeah, like kids.

48:59.396 --> 49:02.396
Come on.

49:02.428 --> 49:03.829
I don't want to.

49:03.861 --> 49:07.428
I want to go back to sleep.

49:07.461 --> 49:09.329
Sweet dreams.

49:14.929 --> 49:17.728
This one's mine.

49:20.761 --> 49:21.861
Just play it.

51:19.028 --> 51:20.996
I know you're there.

51:24.527 --> 51:26.027
Why'd you have to pick him?

51:26.061 --> 51:29.027
Because you're not good
enough to be one of us.

51:30.761 --> 51:33.329
You're not smart enough
to do what he can do.

51:33.362 --> 51:35.861
Uh-uh. I'm better than
him. I'm smarter too.

51:35.894 --> 51:39.394
If you were, then we would have chosen you.

51:39.427 --> 51:44.463
Tell anyone of this,
and he'll take you first,

51:44.494 --> 51:46.095
then kill your whole family.

51:46.128 --> 51:47.296
Who, Dylan?

51:49.961 --> 51:51.695
Then who?

51:53.628 --> 51:56.594
Okay. Okay.

51:56.627 --> 51:58.562
Okay, okay.

51:58.594 --> 51:59.761
Ooh!

51:59.794 --> 52:00.895
- I can...
- Shh.

52:00.928 --> 52:03.562
Now, listen up. Listen up.

52:03.595 --> 52:06.061
- I live alone, so...
- Shh. Okay.

52:06.096 --> 52:08.696
My God, I have to go to bed.

52:08.729 --> 52:10.329
I have to go to sleep.

52:10.361 --> 52:11.561
Okay.

52:24.527 --> 52:26.395
It's been so long since I felt safe.

52:28.695 --> 52:29.928
Sorry.

52:29.961 --> 52:31.963
No, don't... it's not sorry.

52:36.395 --> 52:40.494
I, um... I need to go to bed.

52:40.527 --> 52:42.628
Yeah. Yeah, tomorrow...

52:42.660 --> 52:45.594
I have... Um... I have a long...

52:45.627 --> 52:48.027
- I have a long drive tomorrow.
- Okay, okay.

52:48.061 --> 52:49.494
Are you gonna be okay?

52:49.527 --> 52:51.361
- Yeah. Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

52:51.395 --> 52:53.394
- Okay.
- Okay.

52:53.427 --> 52:54.394
Okay, good night, Courtney.

52:54.428 --> 52:55.561
Good night.

53:12.463 --> 53:13.561
Hey!

53:14.694 --> 53:16.062
Oh, hey.

53:19.894 --> 53:21.394
Got you this for the road.

53:21.428 --> 53:23.961
You didn't have to do that. Really. Thanks.

53:23.995 --> 53:25.996
You're going to
have to bring that back, though.

53:26.028 --> 53:27.696
Oh, I promise. I'll be back tomorrow.

53:27.728 --> 53:29.795
But... But listen.

53:29.829 --> 53:32.362
Whatever you do, don't...
don't leave the house. Okay?

53:32.395 --> 53:33.429
Trust me.

53:33.461 --> 53:34.795
Okay.

53:34.828 --> 53:36.795
Okay. All right, and I
left my number inside.

53:36.828 --> 53:39.361
Yeah, I got it. That's mine.

53:39.394 --> 53:40.960
So call me when you get there safe

53:40.994 --> 53:42.828
and if you need anything.

53:42.861 --> 53:46.661
Yeah, okay. Um, same deal.

53:46.695 --> 53:47.761
Okay.

53:47.795 --> 53:48.828
- Okay.
- Okay.

53:48.860 --> 53:49.961
- I'll see ya.
- See ya.

53:55.560 --> 53:57.960
"Same deal"?

53:57.995 --> 53:59.996
Same deal.

54:00.027 --> 54:01.461
Jesus.

54:13.494 --> 54:14.660
Sorry. Uh, thanks.

54:14.694 --> 54:16.027
Oh, yeah, sure, man.

54:16.061 --> 54:18.329
Uh, so, uh...

54:18.363 --> 54:19.796
I'm not really sure...

54:19.828 --> 54:21.328
- You all right?
- Yeah, no, I'm fine.

54:21.361 --> 54:22.795
Uh, just a little too much coffee.

54:22.828 --> 54:24.361
Um, you wanna take a seat?

54:24.394 --> 54:25.695
Yeah, sure. Thanks.

54:25.728 --> 54:28.927
Great. Um, here, uh...

54:31.761 --> 54:34.560
Look, I really appreciate
you making the trip.

54:34.594 --> 54:35.729
You're helping me.

54:35.761 --> 54:36.961
Yeah.

54:36.994 --> 54:37.960
You want a drink?

54:37.995 --> 54:40.394
No, that's okay.

54:40.427 --> 54:42.560
I'm going to have a drink. Cheers.

54:42.595 --> 54:47.595
Um... what is all of this about?

54:49.095 --> 54:51.062
Um...

54:51.095 --> 54:53.595
have you ever seen one of these?

54:53.628 --> 54:55.461
This? Yeah, sure, it's a ham radio.

54:55.495 --> 54:58.828
Oh, great, then you've heard
of the Norwegian bughuul.

54:59.895 --> 55:00.896
No.

55:00.928 --> 55:03.660
Um...

55:03.694 --> 55:04.927
years ago,

55:04.960 --> 55:07.494
back in the '70s,

55:07.527 --> 55:09.960
several ham radio enthusiasts,

55:09.994 --> 55:13.594
they ran across a strange transmission.

55:13.628 --> 55:16.828
One night, out of nowhere,

55:16.861 --> 55:20.896
on a rarely used band,

55:20.928 --> 55:25.027
this... this children's piano

55:25.061 --> 55:27.561
starts tinkling.

55:27.594 --> 55:29.428
And for years... I
mean, this thing would...

55:29.460 --> 55:30.696
it would come and go...

55:30.728 --> 55:33.896
I mean, it became an urban legend

55:33.927 --> 55:37.094
until one day,

55:37.127 --> 55:39.395
in the late '90s...

55:41.861 --> 55:44.395
someone finally caught it on tape.

55:51.394 --> 55:54.860
<i>Eight, nine, nine...</i>

55:54.895 --> 55:57.995
<i>five, zero, zero...</i>

55:58.028 --> 56:01.761
<i>one, zero, seven...</i>

56:01.795 --> 56:05.095
<i>five, one, nine...</i>

56:05.128 --> 56:07.629
<i>Stop.</i>

56:24.661 --> 56:26.094
W-What were the numbers?

56:26.127 --> 56:28.629
- Coordinates.
- To where?

56:28.660 --> 56:32.760
A house. A farm.

56:32.795 --> 56:35.796
In the middle of Norway, where
an entire family was murdered...

56:37.060 --> 56:38.595
in 1973.

56:42.360 --> 56:45.795
So tell me, this murder...

56:45.828 --> 56:47.028
is there a...

56:47.061 --> 56:48.361
Missing child?

57:00.960 --> 57:02.860
<i>...bughuul...</i>

57:02.895 --> 57:04.961
<i>...bughuul...</i>

57:04.995 --> 57:07.628
Bughuul.

57:07.661 --> 57:08.995
Are there other broadcasts like this?

57:09.028 --> 57:10.928
There are at least three others like it.

57:10.961 --> 57:13.428
Now, this radio I have seen
over with Jonas' things,

57:13.461 --> 57:14.963
along with this map.

57:20.060 --> 57:22.394
But Jonas found the pattern.

57:22.428 --> 57:25.460
Yet the families are only
murdered after they leave the house

57:25.494 --> 57:26.827
where Bughuul found them.

57:26.861 --> 57:28.329
That's how I've been stopping it.

57:28.361 --> 57:29.495
I've been burning the houses down.

57:29.528 --> 57:31.062
Wait, so the Oswalt house? That was...

57:32.560 --> 57:33.560
Yeah.

57:34.994 --> 57:38.329
The pattern isn't the only
thing that Jonas found.

57:38.360 --> 57:43.061
He also realized the piano
was of particular significance.

57:43.095 --> 57:46.628
There are fragments... references...

57:46.660 --> 57:49.796
to Bughuul... the Bogeyman...

57:49.827 --> 57:52.560
across all cultures, over
the centuries, that...

57:53.660 --> 57:55.594
some cultures believed

57:55.627 --> 57:57.528
that it lived in another realm,

57:57.560 --> 58:00.028
reachable only by ritual

58:00.060 --> 58:01.895
or sacrifice.

58:01.928 --> 58:04.961
And others believed that it... it fed

58:04.994 --> 58:06.695
off of the corruption of innocents,

58:06.727 --> 58:09.895
but no matter what,

58:09.927 --> 58:12.027
there are always three things in common.

58:12.061 --> 58:13.995
There's a murdered family,

58:14.028 --> 58:15.628
missing children,

58:15.660 --> 58:18.528
and some form of iconological totem

58:18.561 --> 58:21.095
or a thematic offering.

58:21.128 --> 58:23.828
An image, literature, music.

58:23.860 --> 58:28.660
Okay, so the murders
are captured through art?

58:28.695 --> 58:30.995
It's aesthetic observance of violence.

58:35.027 --> 58:37.428
But that little girl,

58:37.461 --> 58:39.061
the piano,

58:39.094 --> 58:40.661
what exactly did she say?

58:42.795 --> 58:44.560
It's Norwegian.

58:44.594 --> 58:46.727
She says...

58:46.761 --> 58:52.461
"Quiet, Bughuul can't hear
me over your yelling, Mom."

58:59.095 --> 59:01.528
It's the kids.

59:01.560 --> 59:03.860
He gets the kids?

59:05.561 --> 59:07.461
<i>It's the kids.</i>

59:07.495 --> 59:08.928
<i>He gets the kids?</i>

59:08.960 --> 59:10.494
<i>It's the kids... kids...</i>

59:12.061 --> 59:15.761
Okay, you should probably
destroy that thing,

59:15.795 --> 59:16.995
like soon.

59:17.027 --> 59:18.560
Yeah, yeah, I really should.

59:18.595 --> 59:20.528
Listen to me. There's another problem.

59:21.927 --> 59:23.527
I found another house.

59:23.561 --> 59:25.696
Then burn it down. Break the chain again.

59:25.728 --> 59:27.429
I can't. It's not that simple.

59:27.461 --> 59:29.062
There's already a family
that's living in there...

59:29.094 --> 59:30.627
a mother and her two...

59:30.661 --> 59:31.761
and her two boys.

59:31.795 --> 59:33.828
Jeez... What... Detective!

59:39.361 --> 59:40.395
Say it!

59:40.428 --> 59:42.027
- Stop it!
- Say it!

59:42.060 --> 59:43.494
Say I'm better than you!

59:43.527 --> 59:45.595
Say it!

59:45.626 --> 59:48.394
Say it! Say it! Say it!

59:48.427 --> 59:49.561
Okay, okay.

59:49.594 --> 59:50.595
You're better than me.

59:50.627 --> 59:51.961
You're better than me.

59:51.993 --> 59:54.095
Say you're nothing.

59:54.127 --> 59:55.594
Say you're weak.

59:55.627 --> 59:57.329
Say they made a mistake.

01:00:12.428 --> 01:00:15.329
I hate you. I hate all of you.

01:00:15.361 --> 01:00:16.461
I'm telling Mom.

01:00:16.495 --> 01:00:17.795
You hear that? I'm telling Mom.

01:00:17.828 --> 01:00:20.795
Shh.

01:00:26.861 --> 01:00:28.860
You don't deserve that.

01:00:28.893 --> 01:00:30.828
You should do something about him.

01:00:30.860 --> 01:00:32.460
And your father.

01:00:32.495 --> 01:00:34.062
And your mother.

01:00:35.627 --> 01:00:37.329
My mother didn't do anything.

01:00:40.794 --> 01:00:41.862
Exactly.

01:00:55.494 --> 01:00:58.027
Damn it, Zachary!
What were you thinking?

01:00:58.060 --> 01:00:59.627
- But Mom!
- "But Mom" what?

01:00:59.661 --> 01:01:01.661
Give me one good reason, one good reason,

01:01:01.694 --> 01:01:03.661
why it was okay for
you to hit your brother?

01:01:03.694 --> 01:01:05.760
Never mind. I'm sorry. Okay?

01:01:05.794 --> 01:01:08.627
Okay, you t... you tell
that to your brother.

01:01:10.561 --> 01:01:11.628
Fuck you, Dylan!

01:01:12.860 --> 01:01:13.961
Fuck you too.

01:01:15.460 --> 01:01:16.460
Cunt.

01:01:18.894 --> 01:01:21.528
What, are you going to
hit me now? Like Dad?

01:01:25.860 --> 01:01:28.460
Go to your room...

01:01:28.495 --> 01:01:30.760
and do not take a single step out

01:01:30.793 --> 01:01:31.861
until I say so.

01:01:36.526 --> 01:01:37.960
I didn't do anything, Mom.

01:01:37.994 --> 01:01:39.061
I know, sweetie.

01:01:39.095 --> 01:01:40.695
Just weak.

01:01:40.727 --> 01:01:42.527
You are not weak.

01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:45.794
Don't you ever say that
about yourself. Okay?

01:01:45.827 --> 01:01:47.461
You're strong.

01:01:47.494 --> 01:01:48.728
Okay? You're like me that way.

01:01:48.761 --> 01:01:50.061
Zachary, he's just, um...

01:01:50.095 --> 01:01:51.394
Like Dad?

01:01:51.426 --> 01:01:52.695
No, I didn't mean that.

01:01:52.728 --> 01:01:55.595
But it's true, and you know it.

01:01:55.627 --> 01:01:57.895
Dylan, I'm never going
to let anybody hurt you.

01:01:57.927 --> 01:01:59.894
You let him.

01:01:59.927 --> 01:02:01.527
And you let Dad.

01:03:13.694 --> 01:03:14.928
You're going to like this one.

01:03:17.595 --> 01:03:18.694
It's my favorite.

01:03:21.127 --> 01:03:24.660
No. I don't want it. Not today.

01:03:24.694 --> 01:03:26.427
It has to be tonight.

01:03:26.460 --> 01:03:29.060
If we don't do this tonight, then...

01:03:29.095 --> 01:03:30.061
Then what?

01:03:30.094 --> 01:03:31.694
He'll get real mad at us.

01:03:31.728 --> 01:03:34.627
You don't want to make him mad.

01:03:34.660 --> 01:03:38.594
Please, Dylan. This one's mine.

01:03:38.627 --> 01:03:39.763
I made it.

01:06:55.493 --> 01:06:57.495
This is the last one.

01:06:58.594 --> 01:07:00.795
No. No more.

01:07:00.827 --> 01:07:04.760
Just... on... more.

01:07:04.794 --> 01:07:05.760
No.

01:07:05.793 --> 01:07:07.627
Yes!

01:07:10.993 --> 01:07:12.794
It's downstairs, Dylan.

01:08:04.627 --> 01:08:07.561
Last chance to watch the last movie, Dylan.

01:08:10.993 --> 01:08:12.527
No, Mylo.

01:08:14.560 --> 01:08:17.828
I won't watch any more movies.
I don't want to be like you.

01:08:20.993 --> 01:08:22.859
That's fine.

01:08:22.894 --> 01:08:24.760
They weren't really meant for you anyway.

01:08:25.827 --> 01:08:26.895
What?

01:08:28.394 --> 01:08:30.694
You did what we needed you to do.

01:09:11.828 --> 01:09:13.928
Zach. Zach.

01:09:16.394 --> 01:09:17.960
Zach.

01:09:17.993 --> 01:09:19.627
Zach!

01:09:19.658 --> 01:09:20.960
Zach!

01:09:20.993 --> 01:09:21.993
Zach!

01:09:25.960 --> 01:09:27.327
Go to bed, Dylan.

01:09:33.993 --> 01:09:35.594
Tell anyone,

01:09:35.626 --> 01:09:38.560
and we'll kill you and your whole family

01:09:38.593 --> 01:09:43.560
and watch the film over and over and over.

01:10:16.095 --> 01:10:18.061
What the hell does this say?

01:10:18.094 --> 01:10:20.594
There was an emergency hearing last night.

01:10:20.626 --> 01:10:22.294
Sorry you couldn't be there.

01:10:24.059 --> 01:10:26.859
Judge T. Simmons. Tory
Simmons' boys work for you.

01:10:26.893 --> 01:10:29.594
Well, you'd be hard-pressed to
find anybody within five counties

01:10:29.626 --> 01:10:33.027
that doesn't have a
family that works for me.

01:10:33.059 --> 01:10:34.759
This isn't right.

01:10:34.794 --> 01:10:35.959
This isn't legal.

01:10:35.994 --> 01:10:37.628
Oh, you want to ask the sheriff?

01:10:42.027 --> 01:10:43.594
Don't...

01:10:43.626 --> 01:10:45.794
let the kids see you in cuffs.

01:10:45.828 --> 01:10:46.994
You're not taking my boys.

01:10:47.027 --> 01:10:48.860
Our boys.

01:10:48.893 --> 01:10:50.760
I'm just taking them where they belong.

01:10:52.860 --> 01:10:54.394
You're welcome to come with me if you like.

01:10:54.427 --> 01:10:55.427
Fuck you.

01:10:58.060 --> 01:11:01.527
Either you can stay here without the boys,

01:11:01.560 --> 01:11:05.860
fighting the courts for custody
until you run out on money,

01:11:05.893 --> 01:11:08.894
or you can come home with me,

01:11:08.926 --> 01:11:11.827
spend all the time in the world with them,

01:11:11.859 --> 01:11:15.593
making cute little tables and chairs.

01:11:15.627 --> 01:11:17.926
Either way, I'm taking them.

01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:29.628
Dylan, I need you to pack
your stuff quickly, okay?

01:11:29.659 --> 01:11:31.660
Honey, the police are downstairs,

01:11:31.693 --> 01:11:33.393
and if you don't come out on your own,

01:11:33.427 --> 01:11:34.659
then they're going to come up here.

01:11:34.694 --> 01:11:35.994
Mom, I can't go.

01:11:36.027 --> 01:11:37.560
We have to, baby. We have to go.

01:11:37.593 --> 01:11:38.894
You don't understand.

01:11:38.926 --> 01:11:40.527
You don't know what's going to happen.

01:11:40.559 --> 01:11:41.527
Nothing's going to happen.

01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:42.895
He's going to hurt us.

01:11:42.927 --> 01:11:46.594
I don't like this any more than you do.

01:11:46.626 --> 01:11:49.327
But I won't let that happen.
I'm going to take care of us.

01:11:49.361 --> 01:11:51.593
Now, get your stuff.

01:11:51.627 --> 01:11:53.095
Okay?

01:11:53.126 --> 01:11:54.460
Come on.

01:12:44.893 --> 01:12:46.327
No.

01:12:47.927 --> 01:12:49.594
No.

01:13:05.594 --> 01:13:06.795
Fuck.

01:13:23.493 --> 01:13:25.360
Smells good.

01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:33.995
Come on. Come on.

01:13:47.026 --> 01:13:48.559
Pass the mashed potatoes.

01:13:58.626 --> 01:13:59.760
Thank you, son.

01:14:20.559 --> 01:14:21.860
You haven't touched your food.

01:14:23.127 --> 01:14:24.593
I'm not very hungry.

01:14:24.627 --> 01:14:26.760
Come on, buddy.

01:14:26.794 --> 01:14:29.660
I got a big day planned for us tomorrow.

01:14:29.694 --> 01:14:31.174
You're going to need all that energy.

01:14:33.793 --> 01:14:35.360
Eat!

01:14:38.460 --> 01:14:41.061
Clint! Stop that now!

01:14:58.427 --> 01:14:59.994
Boys have to eat.

01:15:09.926 --> 01:15:10.927
I'm sorry.

01:15:12.093 --> 01:15:13.595
Okay?

01:15:27.460 --> 01:15:29.994
Mr. Collins, I know that it's late

01:15:30.026 --> 01:15:31.960
but... but I need to speak...

01:15:31.992 --> 01:15:34.459
You need to speak with me? Or my wife?

01:15:34.494 --> 01:15:35.894
What? no.

01:15:35.926 --> 01:15:37.459
No, it's not... it's not like that.

01:15:37.493 --> 01:15:38.959
- You don't understand...
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

01:15:38.993 --> 01:15:40.394
I understand.

01:15:40.426 --> 01:15:42.794
Once you get a piece of a woman like that,

01:15:42.826 --> 01:15:44.359
it's hard to shake it off.

01:15:44.394 --> 01:15:46.960
Okay, you are in danger.

01:15:48.127 --> 01:15:49.460
I'm in danger?

01:15:49.493 --> 01:15:50.894
Okay, just listen.

01:15:52.494 --> 01:15:53.994
I'm in danger? Huh?

01:15:54.027 --> 01:15:55.894
Listen.

01:15:55.927 --> 01:15:58.094
- I'm trying to...
- Say it again!

01:15:58.127 --> 01:15:59.460
I'm in danger?

01:16:01.659 --> 01:16:02.993
Say it again!

01:16:15.859 --> 01:16:18.427
Now...

01:16:18.459 --> 01:16:20.759
if you ever try to contact my wife again,

01:16:20.793 --> 01:16:23.794
first I'm going to take it out on her hide.

01:16:23.827 --> 01:16:25.727
And then I'm going to come and find you,

01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:27.395
and I'm going to shoot you.

01:16:28.926 --> 01:16:31.860
Am I making myself perfectly fucking clear?

01:16:33.859 --> 01:16:36.394
Now, get off my property
while I go fuck my wife.

01:17:01.559 --> 01:17:04.694
All right, just stand up straight.

01:17:04.726 --> 01:17:07.860
Keep your eyes on the
ball. All right? Ready?

01:17:07.892 --> 01:17:08.932
Oh, good, baby.

01:17:08.959 --> 01:17:10.559
Come on.

01:17:16.094 --> 01:17:18.894
Sure they're gonna like this one.

01:17:18.926 --> 01:17:21.560
Ready? Go for it. Hit the ball.

01:17:21.593 --> 01:17:23.694
Jesus, why are your hands like this?

01:19:23.792 --> 01:19:25.793
I'm gonna make the best one yet.

01:19:26.959 --> 01:19:28.893
Zach?

01:19:28.926 --> 01:19:33.094
Is that you? Zach?

01:19:33.126 --> 01:19:35.559
Zach! Zach!

01:19:36.960 --> 01:19:39.927
Zach! Zach...

01:20:42.927 --> 01:20:43.994
Oh, God.

01:21:21.126 --> 01:21:22.993
Okay, listen. It's me. I'm here.

01:21:23.026 --> 01:21:24.626
Just hold still. All right?

01:21:24.660 --> 01:21:26.060
It's okay. I'm going to get you down.

01:21:26.094 --> 01:21:28.094
I'm gonna get you down.

01:21:28.127 --> 01:21:30.493
Okay. It's okay. It's okay. I got you.

01:21:30.526 --> 01:21:31.627
I got you.

01:21:31.659 --> 01:21:33.094
Okay. Give me your hand.

01:21:33.127 --> 01:21:34.861
It's okay. Dylan.

01:21:39.992 --> 01:21:41.426
Hold still.

01:21:43.625 --> 01:21:45.359
Okay. You all right?

01:21:45.393 --> 01:21:46.559
- Huh?
- Baby.

01:21:46.593 --> 01:21:47.893
You better finish this, Zach.

01:21:53.625 --> 01:21:54.894
Zach!

01:21:54.926 --> 01:21:56.360
- No, run! Now!
- Zach!

01:22:35.992 --> 01:22:37.459
Okay.

01:22:37.493 --> 01:22:38.894
Oh!

01:22:38.927 --> 01:22:40.560
- It's okay. Hurry.
- I'll tie it. Hold it.

01:22:40.593 --> 01:22:43.360
Oh, God!

01:22:52.592 --> 01:22:54.559
Wait, hold on. Wait, wait, wait. Wait.

01:23:05.093 --> 01:23:08.326
They're here somewhere, Zach.

01:23:08.360 --> 01:23:09.627
It's time to find them

01:23:09.659 --> 01:23:10.826
and finish your movie.

01:23:19.958 --> 01:23:21.927
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

01:23:29.526 --> 01:23:31.727
We gotta get in here. Come on.

01:23:31.759 --> 01:23:32.926
Quick.

01:24:37.893 --> 01:24:39.594
Shh.

01:24:49.393 --> 01:24:50.693
In here.

01:25:14.392 --> 01:25:16.295
Run! Courtney!

01:25:59.827 --> 01:26:01.327
Hey!

01:26:10.593 --> 01:26:11.994
No, no.

01:26:12.025 --> 01:26:13.059
It's over, Zach.

01:26:14.626 --> 01:26:15.959
You're not making them a film.

01:26:19.826 --> 01:26:21.626
No. No, no, no!

01:26:21.658 --> 01:26:23.492
No! No!

01:26:23.525 --> 01:26:27.660
No!

01:26:33.559 --> 01:26:35.493
Please be another camera.

01:26:35.525 --> 01:26:36.993
Please be another camera.

01:26:37.026 --> 01:26:38.360
Please be another camera.

01:26:40.858 --> 01:26:42.759
Oh!

01:26:50.659 --> 01:26:51.693
He's going to be mad.

01:26:51.727 --> 01:26:53.360
He's going to be so mad.

01:26:53.392 --> 01:26:54.993
It's over.

01:26:55.026 --> 01:26:56.959
You can never come back.

01:26:56.992 --> 01:26:59.593
No, I'm not finished!

01:26:59.626 --> 01:27:00.959
It's too late.

01:27:00.992 --> 01:27:02.659
You had to kill them all.

01:27:22.727 --> 01:27:26.393
Zach? Zach!

01:27:26.425 --> 01:27:27.926
He's gone!

01:27:27.958 --> 01:27:30.059
No, no, no, Courtney. He's gone.

01:27:30.094 --> 01:27:31.593
We have to go.

01:27:31.625 --> 01:27:33.592
We have to go.

01:27:33.626 --> 01:27:36.360
Courtney, we have to go.

01:27:36.392 --> 01:27:37.526
We have to go.

01:27:37.559 --> 01:27:39.860
Go! Now! Go! Go!

01:27:55.525 --> 01:27:57.526
I got her.

01:27:57.559 --> 01:27:58.626
I love you, Mom.

01:28:25.727 --> 01:28:26.994
Be right back.

01:28:55.126 --> 01:28:57.694
<i>The kids.
It's the kid... kids.</i>

01:28:57.726 --> 01:28:59.958
<i>It's the
kids. He gets the kids.</i>

01:28:59.992 --> 01:29:02.459
<i>It's the kids. He gets the kids.</i>

01:29:04.059 --> 01:29:07.759
<i>Deputy.</i>

01:29:07.792 --> 01:29:10.593
<i>Deputy.</i>
