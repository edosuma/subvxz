00:07.540 --> 00:11.311
- THE NEW YORK CITY REAL ESTATE
MARKET RIGHT NOW IS ON FIRE.

00:11.344 --> 00:13.179
EVERY DAY, I WAKE UP
AT 4:23 IN THE MORNING.

00:13.213 --> 00:16.316
I'M IN THE GYM BY 5:00.
I'M OUT BY 6:00.

00:16.349 --> 00:18.451
I'M SHOWERED AND IN THE OFFICE
BY 7:00.

00:18.485 --> 00:19.886
THEN I RUN AROUND
AND I SHOW CLIENTS,

00:19.919 --> 00:22.255
I BUILD NEW BUSINESS,
AND THEN I GO TO DINNER

00:22.288 --> 00:23.790
OR TO AN EVENT
EVERY SINGLE NIGHT.

00:23.823 --> 00:25.725
THEN I'M BACK IN THE OFFICE
TILL ABOUT MIDNIGHT, 1:00,

00:25.759 --> 00:28.995
AND THEN I WAKE UP AT 4:23
AND DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN.

00:29.029 --> 00:31.464
I AM DOING QUADRUPLE
THE BUSINESS THIS YEAR

00:31.498 --> 00:32.732
THAN LAST YEAR,

00:32.766 --> 00:35.268
AND LAST YEAR,
I MADE A LOT OF MONEY.

00:35.301 --> 00:37.937
- WHY DO YOU THINK WE CAN
ACTUALLY MOVE OUR APARTMENT?

00:37.971 --> 00:39.539
- BECAUSE I'M YOUR BROKER.

00:39.572 --> 00:40.940
I'M HAVING THE TIME
OF MY LIFE.

00:40.974 --> 00:43.209
I'M MAKING DEALS
ALL OVER TOWN

00:43.243 --> 00:45.211
AND CELEBRATING
AFTER EVERY SALE.

00:45.245 --> 00:48.048
MY LIFE HAS CHANGED
IN A LOT OF WAYS,

00:48.081 --> 00:51.017
BUT SOME THINGS
NEVER CHANGE.

00:51.051 --> 00:53.420
[funky music]

00:53.453 --> 00:55.555
- IT'S 6:30 IN THE MORNING.

00:55.588 --> 00:57.290
I'M HERE.
WHERE ARE YOU?

00:57.323 --> 00:58.892
MY BUSINESS HAS EXPLODED
THIS YEAR...

00:58.925 --> 00:59.959
WHOO!

01:00.060 --> 01:01.494
ESPECIALLY GOING UP
IN PRICE POINTS.

01:01.528 --> 01:02.762
I WAS ALWAYS REALLY STRONG

01:02.796 --> 01:05.065
IN, LIKE, THE 2 MILLION
TO 5 MILLION,

01:05.098 --> 01:07.334
BUT LATELY, IT'S BEEN
A LOT OVER 10 MILLION.

01:07.367 --> 01:09.536
WHATEVER THE MARKET IS,
I'M GONNA GET 5 MILLION MORE.

01:09.569 --> 01:10.704
HOW'S THAT?

01:10.737 --> 01:12.172
IT DOESN'T MEAN
THAT THINGS ARE NOT CRAZY.

01:12.205 --> 01:13.506
NO, I'M NOT HAPPY AT ALL.

01:13.540 --> 01:15.709
THEY ARE, MORE THAN EVER.

01:15.742 --> 01:18.144
WHEN I COME HOME...

01:22.949 --> 01:24.584

01:27.320 --> 01:29.956
AND YOU'RE COOKING TOO?
WHOA, IT SMELLS AMAZING.

01:29.989 --> 01:31.558
IT IS SO CRAZY
THAT I'M ACTUALLY SAYING THAT.

01:31.591 --> 01:34.094
WE'RE GONNA GET MARRIED!
WE'RE GONNA GET MARRIED!

01:44.904 --> 01:47.374
I'M 25 YEARS OLD, AND I'M
FROM SAN JUAN, PUERTO RICO,

01:47.407 --> 01:50.877
AND I'M AN UP-AND-COMER
REAL ESTATE BROKER IN THE CITY.

01:50.910 --> 01:52.112
SOME PEOPLE NEED TO GO
TO THE GYM

01:52.112 --> 01:53.246
TO FEEL STRONG
ABOUT THEMSELVES.

01:53.279 --> 01:54.414
THEY NEED THEIR MUSCLE.

01:54.447 --> 01:56.149
I DON'T GO TO THE GYM
WHATSOEVER.

01:56.182 --> 01:59.119
WHAT GETS ME GOING--
GOOD MUSIC, GOOD COFFEE,

01:59.119 --> 02:01.421
SITTING DOWN OUTSIDE THE WINDOW,
LOOKING AT MY VIEW,

02:01.454 --> 02:03.757
AND UNDERSTANDING WHAT I'M
ABOUT TO CONQUER THAT DAY.

02:03.790 --> 02:06.960
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I GO TO THE GYM, BUT HERE.

02:07.060 --> 02:08.762
[whistles]

02:08.795 --> 02:10.697
WHAT SEPARATES ME FROM
ANY OTHER AGENT IN THIS CITY

02:10.730 --> 02:13.233
IS THAT I SEE
AND AUTHENTICALLY SEE EVERYBODY

02:13.266 --> 02:14.267
AS A POTENTIAL CLIENT.

02:14.300 --> 02:16.069
MR. NASH!
- YES!

02:16.069 --> 02:18.071
- HOW'S THAT LUNCH GOING?
- BEAUTIFUL!

02:18.071 --> 02:19.873
- I LOVE IT!
I'M COMING BACK FOR MORE.

02:19.906 --> 02:21.207
HELLO.
I LOVE THE GLASSES.

02:21.241 --> 02:23.376
- THANK YOU.
- HEY, GUYS. HOW ARE YOU?

02:23.410 --> 02:25.078
I THINK A DOORMAN

02:25.078 --> 02:27.814
IS JUST AS IMPORTANT AS THE GUY
WHO OWNS THE BUILDING,

02:27.847 --> 02:30.517
BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW
WHERE A DEAL IS GONNA COME FROM,

02:30.550 --> 02:34.087
AND THESE ARE THE GUYS WHO KNOW
WHO COMES IN AND OUT, PERIOD.

02:34.087 --> 02:35.422
ALL RIGHT, WE GOT
SOMETHING GREAT GOING.

02:35.455 --> 02:37.791
I AM ALL ABOUT PASSION,

02:37.824 --> 02:39.125
AND I HAVE A LOT OF LOVE
FOR EVERYBODY,

02:39.159 --> 02:40.727
BUT IF YOU [bleep] WITH ME,

02:40.760 --> 02:42.462
IT'S A WRAP, IT'S DONE,
YOU'RE DONE.

02:42.495 --> 02:44.397
[speaking Spanish]

02:44.431 --> 02:45.598
I NEED THAT TODAY, MAN.

02:45.632 --> 02:48.268
IT'S IN MY BLOOD.
I'M PUERTO RICAN.

02:48.301 --> 02:49.569
WHAT GOT ME INTO REAL ESTATE

02:49.602 --> 02:52.138
IS THE FACT
THAT THERE IS NO RULES.

02:52.172 --> 02:53.807
I WANT TO AGREE WITH YOU
SO BAD,

02:53.840 --> 02:55.809
BUT IT'S IRRATIONAL PRICING.

02:55.842 --> 02:57.110
FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN MY LIFE,

02:57.110 --> 02:58.211
I FEEL LIKE I CAN
DO THINGS MY WAY,

02:58.244 --> 03:00.347
AND MY WAY HAS ACTUALLY
PAID OFF SO FAR.

03:00.380 --> 03:03.550
[techno music]

03:03.583 --> 03:05.085
- MY MOTTO IS EXPANSION,

03:05.118 --> 03:08.955
ALWAYS IN ALL WAYS.

03:09.055 --> 03:10.156
- NEW YORK CITY--

03:10.190 --> 03:12.792
IT'S THE MOST EXCITING CITY
FOR REAL ESTATE,

03:12.826 --> 03:13.893
AND THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

03:13.927 --> 03:16.463
- I'M THE CLOSER
AND A LISTING MACHINE.

03:16.496 --> 03:19.099
WHAT MAKES ME BETTER IS THAT
I WORK HARDER THAN ANYONE ELSE.

03:19.132 --> 03:20.400
- THIS IS THE SECOND TIME
YOU'VE DISRESPECTED ME, BRO.

03:20.433 --> 03:21.835
- HAVE I MET YOU BEFORE?

03:21.868 --> 03:24.304
- I WANTED THIS THING MORE THAN
ANYBODY ELSE, AND YOU KNEW IT!

03:24.337 --> 03:25.472
- IT'S OVER!

- 60 COLLISTER
IS IN NORTHWEST TRIBECA,

03:41.855 --> 03:45.325
WHICH COULD BE CONSIDERED THE
MOST EXPENSIVE PART OF DOWNTOWN.

03:45.358 --> 03:46.893
IT ATTRACTS FAMILIES
AND CELEBRITIES

03:46.926 --> 03:49.095
BECAUSE IT'S SO QUIET.

03:49.095 --> 03:52.932
THIS BUILDING USED TO BE THE OLD
AMERICAN EXPRESS CARRIAGE HOUSE

03:52.966 --> 03:54.567
FROM THE 19TH CENTURY.

03:54.601 --> 03:56.403
I'M VERY FAMILIAR
WITH THE BUILDING.

03:56.436 --> 03:58.905
I ACTUALLY SOLD EVERY OTHER
APARTMENT IN THE BUILDING

03:58.938 --> 04:00.740
FOR A DEVELOPER OF MINE.

04:00.774 --> 04:03.043
STUART? HI.
FREDRIK EKLUND.

04:03.043 --> 04:05.211
NICE TO MEET YOU.
YOU'RE THE OWNER?

04:05.245 --> 04:08.948
- UH, OWNER, DESIGNER,
AND ACTUAL CONTRACTOR.

04:09.049 --> 04:09.949
- OKAY.

04:10.050 --> 04:12.952
[upbeat music]

04:13.053 --> 04:14.888
WHOA!

04:14.921 --> 04:16.856
SO NOW I UNDERSTAND WHY THEY
CALL IT THE MARBLE HOUSE.

04:16.890 --> 04:18.158
THE MARBLE HOUSE
IS VERY DIFFERENT

04:18.191 --> 04:20.126
FROM ANY OTHER UNIT
IN THE BUILDING.

04:20.160 --> 04:22.062
IT'S BASICALLY A MANSION.

04:22.062 --> 04:24.497
IT'S 9,200 SQUARE FEET
ON THREE LEVELS.

04:24.531 --> 04:26.066
- SO THIS IS THE MASTER.

04:26.066 --> 04:27.834
- OH, MY GOD.
THAT'S REALLY BIG.

04:27.867 --> 04:30.637
THERE ARE JUST NO COMPS
FOR THE MARBLE HOUSE.

04:30.670 --> 04:32.706
- HERE IS THE, UH,
MASTER CLOSET.

04:32.739 --> 04:33.740
- WHOA.

04:33.773 --> 04:36.076
STUART PUT IN OVER $3 MILLION

04:36.076 --> 04:37.477
INTO RENOVATING
THE MARBLE HOUSE.

04:37.510 --> 04:40.980
JUST THE MARBLE ALONE
IS AT LEAST A MILLION.

04:41.081 --> 04:42.716
O.M.G.

04:42.749 --> 04:44.517
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN
DOING THIS FOR TEN YEARS.

04:44.551 --> 04:45.719
IT'S NOT THAT OFTEN I SEE

04:45.752 --> 04:48.722
SOMETHING THAT GIVES ME
GOOSEY-GOOSEY BUMPS.

04:48.755 --> 04:52.092
UNBELIEVABLE.

04:52.092 --> 04:53.727
WHOA!

04:53.760 --> 04:54.928
-<i>VOILA!</i>

04:54.961 --> 04:55.929
- OH, MY GOD.

04:55.962 --> 04:57.664
- THIS IS A REAL SWIMMING POOL.

04:57.697 --> 04:59.666
- LIKE, YOU DID MARBLE
THROUGHOUT.

04:59.699 --> 05:01.334
WALLS, CEILINGS, FLOOR.

05:01.368 --> 05:04.137
WELL, I'M IMPRESSED.
THIS IS AMAZING.

05:04.170 --> 05:06.740
I THINK IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

05:06.773 --> 05:09.209
I ALMOST GOT AROUSED,
WALKING AROUND.

05:09.242 --> 05:11.211
IT'S SO TASTEFULLY DONE.

05:11.244 --> 05:14.147
SO I'M ASSUMING YOU MUST HAVE
A PRICE IN MIND FOR IT.

05:14.180 --> 05:16.649
- YES, ABSOLUTELY.

05:16.683 --> 05:17.817
- AND WHAT IS IT?

05:17.851 --> 05:20.487
- OH, WHAT IS THE PRICE?
UH...

05:20.520 --> 05:21.721
- I COULD TELL YOU THE PRICE,

05:21.755 --> 05:23.056
BUT I'M ASSUMING
YOU HAVE A PRICE.

05:23.089 --> 05:25.258
- WELL,
I HAVE ANOTHER PROJECT

05:25.291 --> 05:27.560
THAT I WANT TO GET GOING ON
RIGHT AWAY,

05:27.594 --> 05:29.562
SO LET ME REVERSE
THE QUESTION.

05:29.596 --> 05:31.798
WHAT'S THE NUMBER THAT'S GONNA
MOVE THIS IMMEDIATELY,

05:31.831 --> 05:33.299
SO I CAN MOVE ON
TO MY NEXT PROJECT?

05:33.333 --> 05:34.467
- WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO ME?

05:34.501 --> 05:36.803
IS IT TWO DAYS?
IS IT SIX MONTHS?

05:36.836 --> 05:39.172
- HOW DO WE SELL THIS
IN 30 DAYS?

05:39.205 --> 05:41.441
- YOU WANT ME TO SELL
THIS PLACE IN 30 DAYS?

05:41.474 --> 05:43.943
BE DONE? CLOSING, ALL CASH,
DONE, DONE, DONE?

05:43.977 --> 05:46.279
- I'M GONNA PRESUME YOU'D LIKE
TO SELL IT IN FIVE MINUTES.

05:46.312 --> 05:48.081
- OH, I'M ALREADY
ON THE PHONE.

05:48.081 --> 05:50.116
AS SOON AS I'M OUT OF HERE,
I'M CALLING ALL MY BUYERS,

05:50.150 --> 05:53.086
BUT, STU, 30 DAYS?
- YES.

05:53.086 --> 05:56.690
- OOH.
IN 30 DAYS?

05:56.723 --> 05:59.092
- YES.

05:59.125 --> 06:02.062
- 17 MILLION.

06:02.095 --> 06:05.198
- 17 IS TOO LOW.

06:05.231 --> 06:08.902
- OKAY. 17,250,000.

06:08.935 --> 06:11.137
IF WE'RE GONNA CLOSE
IN 30 DAYS,

06:11.171 --> 06:12.272
I'VE GOT TO FIND A BUYER
WITHIN A WEEK.

06:12.305 --> 06:13.273
I HAVE TO DO
A BROKER'S OPEN HOUSE,

06:13.306 --> 06:14.541
I HAVE TO DO
MULTIPLE SHOWINGS.

06:14.574 --> 06:17.077
I HAVE TO DO EMAIL BLASTS,
PRESS, ADVERTISEMENTS.

06:17.110 --> 06:20.380
I MEAN,
I'M NOT A MAGICIAN.

06:20.413 --> 06:23.083
- YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
THE BEST IN THE BUSINESS.

06:23.116 --> 06:25.485
I BELIEVE YOU'VE SOLD EVERYTHING
AVAILABLE IN THIS BUILDING.

06:25.518 --> 06:26.519
- THAT'S CORRECT.

06:26.553 --> 06:30.790
- SO HOW ABOUT 17.5
IN 30 DAYS?

06:30.824 --> 06:33.393
- HMM. OKAY.

06:33.426 --> 06:34.794
- LET'S DO IT.
- LET'S DO IT.

06:34.828 --> 06:36.196
- ALL RIGHT.

06:36.229 --> 06:39.399
- THAT'S A BIG NUMBER,
EVEN FOR EXPENSIVE TRIBECA.

06:39.432 --> 06:41.935
AND THAT 30 DAYS, IT STARTS
TOMORROW, JUST SO YOU KNOW.

06:41.968 --> 06:44.304
NOT TODAY.
EVERY DAY COUNTS FOR ME.

06:44.337 --> 06:46.740
30 DAYS FOR ANY PLACE
IS TOUGH,

06:46.773 --> 06:50.076
BUT 30 DAYS FOR THIS PLACE
IS GONNA BE A CHALLENGE.

06:50.076 --> 06:51.911
I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY
OTHER AGENTS IN NEW YORK CITY

06:51.945 --> 06:53.646
WOULD ACTUALLY TAKE THIS ON.

06:53.680 --> 06:55.982
TOOT, TOOT.

[jazzy music]

06:59.085 --> 07:06.393

07:06.426 --> 07:09.763

INTO A BIGGER AGENCY...

07:09.796 --> 07:10.930
[dials number]

07:11.031 --> 07:13.500
AND THEY HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT JUST HIT THEM.

07:13.533 --> 07:16.703
BOOM!
[laughs]

07:16.736 --> 07:18.738
- HELLO?
- HEY, JOHN, THIS IS LUIS ORTIZ.

07:18.772 --> 07:20.040
WE MET
AT ONE OF MY OPEN HOUSES.

07:20.040 --> 07:21.541
THE PUERTO RICAN GUY
WITH THE BIG HAIR?

07:21.574 --> 07:22.676
- YEAH, YEAH.

07:22.709 --> 07:24.511
- I KNOW I'M THE NEW KID
ON THE BLOCK.

07:24.544 --> 07:25.645
I KNOW I'M A ROOKIE

07:25.679 --> 07:26.946
WHEN IT COMES TO REAL ESTATE
IN THE CITY,

07:27.047 --> 07:28.081
'CAUSE I HAVEN'T BEEN DOING IT
FOR LONG,

07:28.114 --> 07:30.150
SO I HAVE TO GET CREATIVE
TO GET CLIENTS

07:30.183 --> 07:32.218
TO COMPETE WITH
ALL THESE REAL ESTATE BROKERS

07:32.252 --> 07:34.087
THAT HAVE BEEN IN THE MARKET
FOR MORE THAN 30 YEARS.

07:34.120 --> 07:35.422
OH, YOU FOUND A PLACE
ALREADY?

07:35.455 --> 07:36.656
- YEAH.
- ALL RIGHT.

07:36.690 --> 07:38.124
UH, HAVE A GOOD ONE.

07:38.158 --> 07:40.493
ONE OF MY STRATEGIES TO GENERATE
LEADS FOR NEW LISTINGS

07:40.527 --> 07:43.063
IS TO COLD-CALL
ABSOLUTELY EVERYBODY

07:43.096 --> 07:44.698
THAT HAS EVER COME TO ANY

07:44.731 --> 07:46.066
OF THE OPEN HOUSES
THAT I HAVE DONE.

07:46.099 --> 07:47.701
- LET ME--
LET ME STOP YOU THERE.

07:47.734 --> 07:49.936
THANK YOU VERY MUCH,
BUT I ALREADY HAVE A BROKER.

07:49.969 --> 07:52.072
- OKAY, UNDERSTOOD.
AND I RESPECT THE LOYALTY, BUT--

07:52.072 --> 07:54.107
- THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
- EXCUSE ME.

08:03.283 --> 08:04.751
- SURE.

08:04.784 --> 08:06.653
- I WANTED TO ASK YOU IF THERE
IS ANY WAY THAT I CAN HELP YOU

08:06.686 --> 08:11.124
FIND SOMETHING THAT MIGHT BE
SIMILAR AROUND THE VILLAGE?

08:11.157 --> 08:14.094
- WELL, UH,
I'M--YOU KNOW,

08:14.127 --> 08:15.562
EVERY TIME SOMEONE BRINGS
SOMETHING TO ME,

08:15.595 --> 08:17.230
I SAY, "ALL RIGHT,
BUT I HAVE A BROKER."

08:17.263 --> 08:18.365
- YEAH.

08:18.398 --> 08:19.733
- HOWEVER, YOU KNOW,

08:19.766 --> 08:21.101
WE'VE BEEN AT THIS
FOR A YEAR AND A HALF

08:21.134 --> 08:24.738
SINCE WE SOLD OUR PLACE,
AND NOTHING IS COMING UP.

08:24.771 --> 08:27.073
- ADAM RIGHT NOW
HAS A BROKER,

08:27.107 --> 08:29.175
BUT IF THAT BROKER HAS NOT BEEN
ABLE TO DELIVER,

08:29.209 --> 08:30.744
THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG.

08:30.777 --> 08:32.178
- I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

08:32.212 --> 08:35.048
FIRST, MEET WITH ME,
UH, JUST FACE TO FACE,

08:35.048 --> 08:39.686
GIVE ME A CHANCE,
AND THEN PUT ME TO WORK.

08:39.719 --> 08:44.591
- WELL, UH, SURE, I'LL--
I'LL HAVE A MEETING WITH YOU.

08:44.624 --> 08:47.193
- I LOVE IT, ADAM. ALL RIGHT,
SO I'LL CALL YOU SOON.

08:47.227 --> 08:49.129
- YOU GOT IT.
THANK YOU.

08:49.162 --> 08:52.065
- [laughs]
ALL RIGHT.

08:52.098 --> 08:55.068
[upbeat music]

08:55.101 --> 08:56.803
* *

08:56.836 --> 08:58.304
- ALL RIGHT.
HEY, RYAN, WHAT'S THE NEXT STOP?

08:58.338 --> 09:01.808
- UH, I HAVE TO PITCH A
PENTHOUSE AT THE PARK IMPERIAL.

09:01.841 --> 09:03.209
- OKAY.

09:03.243 --> 09:05.011
- SICK.

09:05.011 --> 09:07.414
THE PARK IMPERIAL IS LOCATED
ON 56TH AND BROADWAY,

09:07.447 --> 09:10.884
AND NOW THAT CORNER
OF CENTRAL PARK

09:10.917 --> 09:15.321
IS ONE OF THE HIGHEST-VALUED
AREAS OF ALL OF MANHATTAN.

09:15.355 --> 09:17.223
THIS IS IT. LET'S DO IT.
- THIS IS IT? ALL RIGHT.

09:17.257 --> 09:18.491
- MY LISTING APPOINTMENT,
PENTHOUSE "A,"

09:18.525 --> 09:21.761
IS OWNED BY A VERY WEALTHY
JAPANESE BUSINESSMAN,

09:21.795 --> 09:23.363
BUT HE'S NEVER USED IT.

09:23.396 --> 09:26.032
HE'S NEVER RENTED IT EITHER,
SO ESSENTIALLY,

09:26.032 --> 09:28.134
IT'S JUST BEEN SITTING THERE,
EMPTY.

09:28.168 --> 09:30.470
RYAN.
- WILL CABAN. NICE TO MEET YOU.

09:30.503 --> 09:32.105
- HEY, GOOD TO MEET YOU.
- COME RIGHT IN.

09:32.138 --> 09:33.640
- THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
- ABSOLUTELY, ABSOLUTELY.

09:33.673 --> 09:37.777
- OH, MY GOD.
- I KNEW YOU'D LIKE IT.

09:37.811 --> 09:41.047
- AS SOON AS YOU WALK IN,
YOU SEE THE VIEW,

09:41.047 --> 09:43.049
AND IT DOESN'T EVEN
LOOK REAL.

09:43.083 --> 09:44.584
IT LOOKS LIKE CENTRAL PARK

09:44.617 --> 09:46.820
HAS JUST BEEN ROLLED OUT AS
A RED CARPET IN FRONT OF YOU.

09:46.853 --> 09:48.121
[exhales]

09:48.154 --> 09:49.456
- WHY DON'T WE TAKE A LOOK
AROUND THE HOUSE?

09:49.489 --> 09:50.457
- SURE.

09:50.490 --> 09:53.460
[upbeat music]

09:53.493 --> 09:59.399
* *

10:05.171 --> 10:08.308
- A LOT OF CLOSET SPACE,
SAME VIEW.

10:08.341 --> 10:11.978
I MEAN,
IT REALLY IS AMAZING.

10:12.012 --> 10:13.847
MY CLIENT'S NEAR AND DEAR
TO ME.

10:13.880 --> 10:16.349
HE BOUGHT IT IN 2006,
A LITTLE OVER $6 MILLION.

10:16.383 --> 10:18.451
IT'S BEEN ON THE MARKET
FOR TWO YEARS.

10:18.485 --> 10:19.753
- RIGHT.

10:19.786 --> 10:22.322
YEAH, NO, I KNOW, WITH, LIKE,
EVERY BROKER IMAGINABLE.

10:22.355 --> 10:24.057
- EVERY SINGLE BROKER
IMAGINABLE.

10:24.090 --> 10:26.693
NOW, KEEP IN MIND,
HE'S NOT GONNA LOWER HIS PRICE.

10:26.726 --> 10:28.628
- HE WANTS TO STAY
AT 8.5 MILLION?

10:28.661 --> 10:29.829
- 8.5.

10:29.863 --> 10:31.164
- RIGHT.

10:31.197 --> 10:32.565
THIS APARTMENT,
TO THE RIGHT BUYER,

10:32.599 --> 10:34.601
MAY BE WORTH 8.5 MILLION.

10:34.634 --> 10:36.770
I MEAN, THE VIEWS
ARE INCREDIBLE.

10:36.803 --> 10:38.638
THE PROBLEM, THOUGH,
IS THE COMPS,

10:38.672 --> 10:39.839
AND THE SAME-SIZE APARTMENT

10:39.873 --> 10:41.107
THAT'S ON THE BACK
OF THE BUILDING

10:41.141 --> 10:44.678
FACING SOUTH WILL BE
AT LEAST $3 MILLION CHEAPER.

10:44.711 --> 10:46.646
I MEAN,
JUST TOTALLY HONEST,

10:46.680 --> 10:50.650
THAT PRICE IS PART OF THE REASON
THIS HASN'T SOLD YET.

10:50.684 --> 10:51.951
'CAUSE HERE'S THE PROBLEM
WITH THIS.

10:51.985 --> 10:53.920
AND I'VE SEEN THIS LISTING,
RIGHT? IT EXISTS.

10:53.953 --> 10:55.755
EVERYONE KNOWS ABOUT IT,
BUT NO ONE'S SHOWING IT

10:55.789 --> 10:57.123
BECAUSE IT
DOESN'T LOOK SERIOUS.

10:57.157 --> 10:58.291
IT'S JUST BEEN SITTING
ON THE MARKET TOO LONG,

10:58.324 --> 10:59.592
AND SO, YOU KNOW--

10:59.626 --> 11:00.794
- DUDE, LET ME--
I DON'T MEAN TO BE RUDE,

11:00.827 --> 11:01.795
BUT CAN YOU DO THIS?

11:01.828 --> 11:04.264
8 1/2?

11:07.100 --> 11:09.769
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
WHY DON'T WE DO THIS?

11:09.803 --> 11:14.741
UM, LET ME RAISE THE PRICE.

11:14.774 --> 11:15.775
- RAISE THE PRICE?
- YEAH.

11:15.809 --> 11:17.210
YEAH, WE'RE GONNA
RAISE THE PRICE.

11:17.243 --> 11:19.079
LET'S RAISE IT $300,000,
ALL RIGHT?

11:19.079 --> 11:20.880
BY RAISING THE PRICE,

11:20.914 --> 11:22.349
EVERYONE'S GONNA
ALL OF A SUDDEN SAY,

11:22.382 --> 11:23.817
"OH, THAT APARTMENT'S
BACK ON THE MARKET FOR 8.8?

11:23.850 --> 11:25.352
"THERE MUST BE SOMETHING
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT IT.

11:25.385 --> 11:27.454
I GOTTA GO CHECK THAT OUT."

11:27.487 --> 11:28.888
AND SO EVERYONE'S GONNA
WANT TO COME AND SEE IT,

11:28.922 --> 11:30.957
AND WE'RE GONNA REIGNITE
THE BUZZ.

11:30.990 --> 11:32.092
- THIS IS A CRAZY IDEA.

11:32.092 --> 11:33.927
IT'S BEEN ON THE MARKET
FOR TWO YEARS.

11:33.960 --> 11:35.395
RAISING THE PRICE?

11:35.428 --> 11:37.364
- I CAN'T PROMISE YOU
THAT I CAN GET YOU THAT NUMBER,

11:37.397 --> 11:39.132
BUT I CAN PROMISE YOU

11:39.165 --> 11:40.934
THAT I'LL BE ABLE TO GET PEOPLE
THROUGH THE DOOR,

11:40.967 --> 11:43.103
WHICH IS WHAT NO ONE ELSE
HAS BEEN ABLE TO DO FOR YOU

11:43.103 --> 11:44.304
FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS.

11:44.337 --> 11:46.106
- RIGHT.

11:46.139 --> 11:49.476
- JUST LEAVE IT TO ME, MAN.

11:49.509 --> 11:51.177
I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.

11:51.211 --> 11:54.180
[suspenseful music]

11:54.214 --> 11:59.319
* *

11:59.352 --> 12:00.587
- I THINK WE SHOULD DO IT.

12:00.620 --> 12:01.921
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S DO IT.

12:01.955 --> 12:03.723
I'M TAKING A HUGE RISK HERE.

12:03.757 --> 12:05.325
IF I RAISE THE PRICE
ON THIS APARTMENT

12:05.358 --> 12:06.893
AND DON'T BRING OFFER,

12:06.926 --> 12:09.062
I'M GONNA BE THE BUTT OF EVERY
JOKE IN THE ENTIRE INDUSTRY.

12:09.095 --> 12:11.231
- I STILL THINK YOU'RE NUTS,
MAN.

12:11.264 --> 12:12.799
- THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR BRINGING ME THROUGH.

12:12.832 --> 12:14.067
- ABSOLUTELY.
- I WILL NOT DISAPPOINT YOU.

12:14.067 --> 12:17.070
- I HOPE NOT.

12:18.171 --> 12:20.540
- OH, MY GOD, SO MANY PEOPLE.
HI.

12:20.573 --> 12:22.876
RYAN SHOWS UP
AT EVERY OPEN HOUSE OF MINE.

12:22.909 --> 12:25.712
THAT'S NOT
WHAT I NEED TONIGHT.

12:36.222 --> 12:37.490
- RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE,

12:37.524 --> 12:40.193
IT'S SO MUCH MORE
THAN JUST CONNECTING A BUYER

12:40.226 --> 12:41.561
WITH AN EXISTING PROPERTY.

12:41.594 --> 12:44.497
SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO ACTUALLY
CREATE OPPORTUNITIES.

12:44.531 --> 12:46.366
- LUIS, HOW ARE YOU?
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.

12:46.399 --> 12:48.168
HOLA, LOUISE.
both: NICE TO MEET YOU.

12:48.201 --> 12:49.502
- SO THE REASON I WANTED
TO MEET YOU GUYS IS,

12:49.536 --> 12:51.738
I KNOW, YOU KNOW,
WE SPOKE OVER THE PHONE

12:51.771 --> 12:53.206
THAT YOU HAVE--YOU'RE CURRENTLY
WORKING WITH A BROKER,

12:53.239 --> 12:57.844
AND I RESPECT VERY MUCH
YOUR LOYALTY, BUT, UM,

12:57.877 --> 13:00.480
MAYBE THERE'S SOMETHING, UM,
OFF THE MARKET THAT,

13:00.513 --> 13:02.048
WHOEVER THE BROKER IS,
HASN'T FOUND.

13:02.048 --> 13:07.053
SO IF FOR SOME REASON
I DO HAPPEN TO FIND SOMETHING

13:07.087 --> 13:09.122
THAT NOBODY ELSE
IS ABLE TO FIND,

13:09.155 --> 13:12.258
WOULD YOU WORK WITH ME
AND, YOU KNOW--

13:12.292 --> 13:13.793
- I DON'T THINK I HAVE
A PROBLEM WITH THAT.

13:13.827 --> 13:15.729
- ALL RIGHT.
- I'LL SUSPEND MY DISBELIEF.

13:15.762 --> 13:17.731
- AN OFF-MARKET PROPERTY

13:17.764 --> 13:20.367
IS A PROPERTY
THAT WAS ONCE ON THE MARKET

13:20.400 --> 13:22.769
AND, FOR SOME REASON,
THE OWNER HAVE DECIDED

13:22.802 --> 13:24.571
TO TAKE IT OFF THE MARKET.

13:24.604 --> 13:26.206
- SO HERE'S
THE IMPOSSIBLE DREAM.

13:26.239 --> 13:27.307
- OKAY.

13:27.340 --> 13:28.608
- SO WE NEED SOMETHING
THAT'S 25 FEET.

13:28.641 --> 13:30.410
WE'D LOVE THE WEST VILLAGE
AS THE EPICENTER,

13:30.443 --> 13:33.313
IF WE CAN GET
A BUILDABLE PROJECT.

13:33.346 --> 13:34.814
I'M AN ARCHITECT,
I'M A CONTRACTOR,

13:34.848 --> 13:37.350
AND I HAVE THE ABILITY
TO LOOK AT STUFF

13:37.384 --> 13:40.086
AND TO DO THINGS THAT NO ONE'S
GONNA WANT TO TOUCH,

13:40.086 --> 13:42.489
AND THAT'S MY ONLY EDGE IN
THIS HYPER-COMPETITIVE WORLD.

13:42.522 --> 13:44.424
- OKAY.
- BUT NOW, HERE'S THE KICKER.

13:44.457 --> 13:46.493
SO WE'D LIKE TO SPEND

13:46.526 --> 13:49.229
4 MILLION OR LESS
ON THE ACQUISITION.

13:49.262 --> 13:51.631
- 4 MILLION?

13:51.664 --> 13:53.166
$4 MILLION?
ARE YOU NUTS?

13:53.199 --> 13:54.567
SINGLE-FAMILY TOWNHOUSES

13:54.601 --> 13:56.436
IN PRIME LOCATION
IN THE WEST VILLAGE

13:56.469 --> 13:57.537
ARE THREE TIMES THAT PRICE.

13:57.570 --> 13:58.538
- SHOULD WE LEAVE NOW?
SHOULD WE GO?

13:58.571 --> 13:59.906
- NO, NO, NO.
NO, NOT YET.

13:59.939 --> 14:01.541
NOW I UNDERSTAND
WHY THEIR BROKER

14:01.574 --> 14:02.842
HASN'T BEEN ABLE
TO GET THEM ANYTHING.

14:02.876 --> 14:04.711
WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR
IS IMPOSSIBLE,

14:04.744 --> 14:06.212
BUT I LOVE IMPOSSIBLE.

14:06.246 --> 14:07.647
IT'S MORE EXCITING.

14:07.681 --> 14:09.516
YOUR CRITERIAS
ARE A LITTLE BIT--

14:09.549 --> 14:11.484
- IMPOSSIBLE?
- ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE.

14:11.518 --> 14:13.253
-<i>MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE?</i>
- BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

14:13.286 --> 14:16.056
I AM SURE THAT THERE IS
SOMETHING OUT THERE.

14:16.056 --> 14:17.157
THE ONLY THING
YOU NEED TO DO

14:17.190 --> 14:19.359
IS JUST KEEP ON GOING
WITH YOUR LIFE

14:19.392 --> 14:20.827
AND KNOWING THAT
THIS PUERTO RICAN IS OUT THERE,

14:20.860 --> 14:22.062
TRYING TO MAKE
SOMETHING HAPPEN.

14:22.062 --> 14:26.533
- THANK YOU.
- NO, THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

14:26.566 --> 14:29.536
[upbeat music]

14:29.569 --> 14:31.204

14:31.237 --> 14:32.739
- ALL RIGHT, SO WHAT DO WE
HAVE SET UP SO FAR?

14:32.772 --> 14:34.307
- WE HAVE
THE MODEL BARTENDERS.

14:34.341 --> 14:36.676
- OKAY, SO WE HAVE
TWO GIRLS, AND THEY'RE NAKED,

14:36.710 --> 14:38.878
AND THEN ONE GUY WITH A BOW TIE,
AND HE'S NAKED.

14:38.912 --> 14:40.613
- YEAH, EXACTLY.
- AWESOME.

14:40.647 --> 14:42.349
IN ADDITION TO RAISING
THE PRICE ON MY PENTHOUSE

14:42.382 --> 14:44.451
AT THE PARK IMPERIAL,
I'M DOING EVERYTHING I CAN

14:44.484 --> 14:46.686
TO MAKE IT FEEL AS NEW
AND FRESH AS POSSIBLE,

14:46.720 --> 14:48.221
SO THIS WEEKEND,

14:48.254 --> 14:51.091
I'M THROWING AN INVITE-ONLY
MASQUERADE PARTY

14:51.124 --> 14:53.426
FOR SOME
OF THE CITY'S TOP BROKERS.

14:53.460 --> 14:55.428

14:55.462 --> 14:56.963
HOW'D YOU FIND THIS PLACE?
- OH, MY GOD. OH, MY GOD.

14:56.996 --> 14:58.498
- IS THIS WHERE YOU SHOP
ALL THE TIME ANYWAY?

14:58.531 --> 15:00.900
OLIVIA IS THE NEW DINA.

15:00.934 --> 15:02.235
- OKAY.

15:02.268 --> 15:04.037
- DINA IS NO LONGER HERE,
SO NOW I HAVE OLIVIA.

15:04.070 --> 15:05.438
- SHOCKER.

15:05.472 --> 15:07.407
- DINA HAS LEFT.

15:07.440 --> 15:10.477
SHE IS NOW MARRIED
AND JUST HAD A BABY,

15:10.510 --> 15:14.781
WHO MIGHT HAVE ONE DIMPLE.

15:14.814 --> 15:16.249
SO I HAVE A NEW ASSISTANT,

15:16.282 --> 15:17.517
AND SHE IS GREAT
AND VERY PROFESSIONAL,

15:17.550 --> 15:20.320
AND SHE IS PRETTY
AND BLONDE.

15:20.353 --> 15:22.389
COULD WE TRY ANY OF THESE ON,
OR ARE THEY--

15:22.422 --> 15:24.057
- YEAH, WE HAVE A BUNCH
OF GREAT MASKS THERE.

15:24.090 --> 15:27.127
[upbeat music]

15:27.160 --> 15:30.063
- MEOW.

15:30.096 --> 15:31.064
CAN YOU MEOW?

15:31.097 --> 15:33.400
- [meows]
SHOULD I WEAR THIS?

15:33.433 --> 15:35.535
NOPE. WHAT ABOUT THIS ONE?
DO YOU LIKE IT?

15:35.568 --> 15:37.203
- I REALLY LIKE IT.
- NO.

15:37.237 --> 15:38.204
DO YOU HAVE THE INVITATION,
ACTUALLY?

15:38.238 --> 15:39.539
THAT REMINDS ME.
- YES.

15:39.572 --> 15:41.408
- I WANT TO GET PEOPLE
TALKING,

15:41.441 --> 15:44.611
AND THE WAY TO DO THAT
IS TO CREATE A SPECTACLE.

15:44.644 --> 15:46.746

REQUIRED."

- [laughs]
- I AM A GENIUS.

15:50.183 --> 15:53.119
- WHY DON'T YOU JUST
DO A REGULAR OPEN HOUSE?

- WHAT?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

RIGHT NOW, MAN. THERE'S NOTHING.

16:19.679 --> 16:21.514
TOWNHOUSE, OFF THE MARKET,
ON THE WEST VILLAGE.

16:21.548 --> 16:23.516
- WHAT'S THEIR BUDGET?
- UP TO 4 MILLION.

16:23.550 --> 16:25.051
- UP TO 4?
- YES.

16:25.085 --> 16:26.786
- WEST VILLAGE? WOW.
- YEAH.

16:26.820 --> 16:29.155
- UM, I'LL TELL YOU,
I HAVE ONE THAT COMES TO MIND.

16:29.189 --> 16:31.391
UM, I'LL MAKE A CALL.
- PLEASE, MAN.

16:31.424 --> 16:32.792
I KNOW YOU'RE WORKING,
BUT, LIKE, YOU KNOW...

16:32.826 --> 16:34.661
- OKAY.
- IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO ME.

16:34.694 --> 16:35.862
THANK YOU, BROTHER.

16:35.895 --> 16:37.364
ANY [bleep] MONKEY
CAN SIT BACK

16:37.397 --> 16:40.200
AND JUST FIND PROPERTIES
ON THE INTERNET.

16:40.233 --> 16:41.468
ME, I THINK
OUTSIDE THE BOX.

16:41.501 --> 16:43.269
- NO, NOTHING.

16:43.303 --> 16:45.071
- BUT IT SEEMS
THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE

16:45.071 --> 16:47.207
A LITTLE BIT TOUGHER
THAT I THOUGHT.

16:47.240 --> 16:50.210
[upbeat music]

16:50.243 --> 16:56.149
* *

16:56.182 --> 16:58.218
- I HAVE 30 DAYS
TO SELL THIS PLACE,

16:58.251 --> 17:02.022
SO I INVITED EVERY BROKER I KNOW
IN THE CITY TO THIS EVENT.

17:02.022 --> 17:04.491
I PERSONALLY CALLED
HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE,

17:04.524 --> 17:06.026
AND ONE LAST CHERRY
ON THE TOP,

17:06.059 --> 17:08.762
I HIRED A MODEL TO BE
IN THE ACTUAL SWIMMING POOL.

17:08.795 --> 17:10.563
AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED
TO WEAR A BIKINI?

17:10.597 --> 17:12.699
- YEAH, I HAVE MY BIKINI.
SHOULD I GO CHANGE INTO IT?

17:12.732 --> 17:14.200
- PUT ON THE BIKINI.
[doorbell rings]

17:14.234 --> 17:15.502
OH, HI.
- WHAT AN ENTRANCE.

17:15.535 --> 17:18.371
- FREDRIK, NICE TO MEET YOU.
- HI. NICE TO MEET YOU.

17:18.405 --> 17:20.040
WELCOME TO THE MARBLE HOUSE.

17:20.073 --> 17:22.575
IT'S CRAZY JUST HOW MANY BROKERS
I GOT UNDER ONE ROOF

17:22.609 --> 17:24.477
ON SUCH SHORT NOTICE.

17:24.511 --> 17:26.179
HI. COME IN, GUYS.

17:26.212 --> 17:28.782
I'M NOT REALLY SURE WHAT OTHER
BROKERS COULD GET THAT DONE.

17:28.815 --> 17:30.316
WELCOME, ALL,
TO THE MARBLE HOUSE.

17:30.350 --> 17:32.652
IT'S 9,200 SQUARE FEET.

17:32.686 --> 17:35.922
THREE FRIDGES
AND SIX FREEZERS.

17:35.955 --> 17:37.757
THERE'S ALSO THE 24-HOUR
DOORMAN, WHICH IS GREAT,

17:37.791 --> 17:39.059
AND THEN THERE'S
PRIVATE PARKING.

17:39.092 --> 17:40.527
ONE MOMENT.

17:40.560 --> 17:41.961
YES, EVERYONE'S HERE.
THE WHOLE CITY IS HERE.

17:42.062 --> 17:43.196
ALL THE BIG BROKERS
ARE HERE.

17:43.229 --> 17:45.065
LOOK AT THAT.
LOOK AT THE MARBLE STEPS.

17:45.065 --> 17:46.299
LOOK AT MY SOCKS.

17:46.332 --> 17:48.668
I MEAN, THE WHOLE THING
IS PRETTY IMPRESSIVE.

17:48.702 --> 17:50.203
CLOSING IN 30 DAYS.
I NEED TO SELL THIS IN 30 DAYS.

17:50.236 --> 17:51.204
- YES!

17:51.237 --> 17:55.342
[overlapping chatter]

17:55.375 --> 17:57.077
- SO WHEN ARE YOU--
WHEN DO YOU THINK

17:57.077 --> 17:58.244
HE'S GONNA COME INTO TOWN?

17:58.278 --> 17:59.679
- UM, I HAVE TO GO BACK.

17:59.713 --> 18:00.880
- THAT'S GREAT.

18:00.914 --> 18:05.218
AND ALL MY INFORMATION
IS ON THERE TOO, SO...

18:05.251 --> 18:06.786
THIS RYAN
IS LIKE A LEECH.

18:06.820 --> 18:09.723
HE SHOWS UP AT EVERY OPEN HOUSE
OF MINE AND CREATES A STIR.

18:09.756 --> 18:10.757
WHO SAID IT WAS CHINATOWN?

18:10.790 --> 18:12.492
- THIS GOES TO CANAL STREET,
RIGHT?

18:12.525 --> 18:14.561
- DO YOU KNOW DOWNTOWN?
- I'LL GIVE YOU MY CARD.

18:14.594 --> 18:16.363
DON'T TELL ANY OTHER BROKERS
HERE I GAVE YOU MY CARD, THOUGH,

18:16.396 --> 18:17.430
BECAUSE IT'S
KIND OF THEIR PARTY.

18:17.464 --> 18:18.898
- I WANT YOU TO LEAVE
RIGHT NOW.

18:18.932 --> 18:20.734
- THIS IS
[bleep] RIDICULOUS.

18:20.767 --> 18:21.901
[door bangs]

18:21.935 --> 18:24.704
- THAT'S NOT WHAT I NEED
TONIGHT.

18:24.738 --> 18:25.839
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR COMING.

18:25.872 --> 18:27.107
I REALLY,
REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

18:27.140 --> 18:29.175
AND YOU SAW THE POOL,
RIGHT?

18:29.209 --> 18:32.912
- YO!

18:32.946 --> 18:34.848
HOW ARE YOU?
- HI. HOW ARE YOU?

18:34.881 --> 18:36.316
- HI.
- HI. HOW ARE YOU? DANA.

18:36.349 --> 18:38.718
- DANA. GOOD TO MEET YOU.
- MANUEL. NICE TO MEET YOU.

18:38.752 --> 18:40.120
- HEY, NICE TIE.
- THANKS.

18:40.153 --> 18:43.356
- SO, UH, DID YOU EVER
CLOSE THAT MAR--

18:43.390 --> 18:45.325
UH, THE, UM,
GREENE STREET PROPERTY?

18:45.358 --> 18:46.459
- NO, NO.
WE CLOSE--

18:46.493 --> 18:48.061
- THE BIG PROPERTY
WITH THE BIG PARTY?

18:48.061 --> 18:49.729
SAY IT AGAIN.
IT DID NOT CLOSE?

18:49.763 --> 18:53.166
- I COME TO THIS OPEN HOUSE
WITH NO AGENDA,

18:53.199 --> 18:55.168
AND THE FIRST THING
THAT FREDRIK BRINGS UP

18:55.201 --> 18:59.739
IS A DEAL THAT I DID LAST YEAR
THAT DIDN'T CLOSE.

18:59.773 --> 19:01.474
I THINK HE'S JUST DOING IT
TO MAKE A JAB AT ME

19:01.508 --> 19:03.209
AND TO TRY TO MAKE ME
LOOK BAD.

19:03.243 --> 19:04.711
WE'VE BEEN GOOD.
IT'S BEEN A GREAT YEAR.

19:04.744 --> 19:06.046
IT'S BEEN PHENOMENAL.
- THANKS FOR COMING.

19:06.079 --> 19:07.347
I'VE REALLY GOT TO,
YOU KNOW, ENTERTAIN.

19:07.380 --> 19:10.550
- OKAY. YEAH, GREAT.
SEE YA.

19:10.583 --> 19:12.619
TWO CAN PLAY AT THAT GAME.

19:12.652 --> 19:14.654
[bleep] YOU.

19:15.922 --> 19:17.023
- I WONDER HOW MANY HOUSES

19:17.023 --> 19:18.758
HAVE A PRIVATE SWIMMING POOL
THIS SIZE.

19:18.792 --> 19:19.759
[overlapping chatter]

19:19.793 --> 19:21.161
- HE'S A DICK.

19:21.194 --> 19:23.129
- OH, MY GOD.

19:31.838 --> 19:33.873
- COME ON, GUYS, THE POOL.
THE BEST PART OF THE HOUSE.

19:33.907 --> 19:37.477
CAN YOU SMELL IT?
AH!

19:37.510 --> 19:40.246
I WONDER HOW MANY HOUSES
IN NEW YORK CITY

19:40.280 --> 19:43.049
HAVE A PRIVATE SWIMMING POOL
THIS SIZE.

19:43.049 --> 19:45.418
- WOW.
THIS IS COOL.

19:45.452 --> 19:49.089
OH, SHE'S PRETTY.

19:49.122 --> 19:51.224
HELLO.

19:51.257 --> 19:55.161
YOU'RE NOT HERE
'CAUSE YOU WANT TO BE.

19:55.195 --> 19:57.163
OH, YOU ARE?

19:57.197 --> 19:59.699
IT'S REALLY COLD.

19:59.733 --> 20:03.236
THAT GUY'S AN [bleep]HOLE.

20:03.269 --> 20:05.138
- IF I HAD THIS IN MY HOUSE,
I WOULD SWIM EVERY MORNING.

20:05.171 --> 20:06.373
- ARE YOU COLD?

20:06.406 --> 20:09.109
I THINK I'LL JUMP
IN THE POOL.

20:09.142 --> 20:10.777
- WELL, YOU WERE SAYING,
CHINESE MILLIONAIRES...

20:10.810 --> 20:14.447
- WATCH THIS.
YOU WANT TO SEE THIS?

20:17.617 --> 20:24.190
[indistinct chatter]

20:24.224 --> 20:26.659
[laughter]

20:26.693 --> 20:29.529
- OH, MY GOD.

20:30.697 --> 20:32.866
I CAN'T BELIE--
I--

20:35.869 --> 20:37.337
IS THIS REALLY HAPPENING?

20:37.370 --> 20:39.272
- SURPRISE, BITCH.
I'M IN THE POOL.

20:39.305 --> 20:40.740
SHE'S REALLY, REALLY COLD.

20:40.774 --> 20:45.478
APPARENTLY, FREDRIK EKLUND DOES
NOT CARE ABOUT FREEZING WOMEN,

20:45.512 --> 20:47.013
BUT RYAN SERHANT DOES.

20:47.047 --> 20:52.018
AND IT WORKED.
I SAVED HER LIFE.

20:52.052 --> 20:53.820
I'M ACTUALLY--LET'S--
LET ME SHOW YOU UPSTAIRS.

20:53.853 --> 20:55.288
I'VE NEVER, EVER,
IN MY LIFE

20:55.321 --> 20:57.957
SEEN ANOTHER BROKER
ACT SO CHILDISHLY.

20:57.991 --> 20:59.359
I'VE GOT TO CONTINUE.

20:59.392 --> 21:01.695
CLOSE THOSE DOORS
AND MOVE ON.

21:01.728 --> 21:04.164
YOU KNOW THE BEST PART?
YOU CAN ACTUALLY LOCK THESE.

21:04.197 --> 21:06.166
COME ON, GUYS,
LET'S GO UPSTAIRS.

21:11.271 --> 21:14.240
[upbeat music]

21:14.274 --> 21:16.976

21:17.077 --> 21:18.178
- HELLO, MORGAN.

21:18.211 --> 21:19.579
I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO CALL YOU ALL DAY.

21:19.612 --> 21:21.081
I AM EXHAUSTED.

21:21.081 --> 21:22.982
I KNOW YOU FOCUS
ON THE WEST VILLAGE.

21:23.083 --> 21:25.652
I HAVE CALLED EVERYBODY I KNOW
AND EVERYBODY I DON'T KNOW.

21:25.685 --> 21:28.655
MY EARS ARE NUMB FROM
HOW MANY CALLS I'VE MADE.

21:28.688 --> 21:30.590
LET ME CALL YOU RIGHT BACK.
I'VE GOT SOMEONE ON THE LINE.

21:30.623 --> 21:32.759
MR. SHAI, HOW ARE YOU,
MY FRIEND?

21:32.792 --> 21:35.362
- GOOD.

21:35.395 --> 21:37.397
- YES.

21:42.969 --> 21:46.006
ABSOLUTELY.
WHAT'S THE ADDRESS?

21:46.106 --> 21:49.809
AND THE OWNERS
ARE GOING TO BE THERE?

21:49.843 --> 21:52.112
ALL RIGHT.
NOW WE'RE GETTING SOMEWHERE.

21:52.112 --> 21:53.313
THANK YOU, SHAI.

21:53.346 --> 21:56.116
BOOM!

21:56.116 --> 21:59.119
[upbeat music]

21:59.119 --> 22:02.355
* *

22:02.389 --> 22:03.823
- OKAY.

22:03.857 --> 22:06.292
IN ADDITION TO HAVING MY
MASQUERADE PARTY THIS WEEKEND,

22:06.326 --> 22:07.660
I ALREADY HAVE A LEAD

22:07.694 --> 22:09.295
ON PENTHOUSE "A"
AT THE PARK IMPERIAL.

22:09.329 --> 22:12.365
THE POTENTIAL BUYER IS ACTUALLY
THE NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR,

22:12.399 --> 22:14.901
WHO, A COUPLE YEARS AGO,
BOUGHT PENTHOUSE "D"

22:14.934 --> 22:17.070
AS HIS FIRST PLACE
IN NEW YORK

22:17.070 --> 22:18.505
AND NOW IS LOOKING
TO EXPAND.

22:18.538 --> 22:19.839
[doorbell rings]

22:19.873 --> 22:21.508
- HEY, HOW ARE YOU DOING?
- HEY, RYAN SERHANT.

22:21.541 --> 22:22.909
- THE NAME'S JIM.
- GOOD TO MEET YOU.

22:22.942 --> 22:24.177
- HOW ARE YOU DOING, RYAN?
- GOOD. GOOD TO SEE YOU, MAN.

22:24.210 --> 22:25.645
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.
- NICE VIEW.

22:25.679 --> 22:27.147
WE KNOW THIS VIEW.
- YEAH, WE KNOW THIS VIEW.

22:27.180 --> 22:29.149
- YEAH.
- SO THIS IS PENTHOUSE "A."

22:29.182 --> 22:30.250
I TAKE IT YOU KNOW
THE BUILDING, YEAH?

22:30.283 --> 22:31.751
- YEAH.

22:31.785 --> 22:32.852
IT LOOKS LIKE HE DIDN'T REALLY
DO MUCH TO THE UNIT, THOUGH.

22:32.886 --> 22:34.087
ISN'T IT KIND OF LIKE--

22:34.087 --> 22:35.355
THIS IS, LIKE, BUILDING
STANDARD, ISN'T IT?

22:35.388 --> 22:36.923
- MM-HMM. YEAH.
IT HASN'T BEEN RENOVATED.

22:36.956 --> 22:38.858
THE ONLY THING THAT'S UNIQUE
ABOUT THE APARTMENT,

22:38.892 --> 22:41.795
IN TERMS OF RENOVATIONS,
IS THE--THE FIREPLACE.

22:41.828 --> 22:42.996
- I ALREADY HAVE ONE
NEXT DOOR.

22:43.096 --> 22:44.097
- DO YOU?
- YEP, YEP.

22:44.097 --> 22:45.398
- YOU...

22:45.432 --> 22:47.200
- THE FLOOR PLAN
DOESN'T LOOK THAT GREAT.

22:47.233 --> 22:48.868
I THINK THIS IS
WAY OVERPRICED.

22:48.902 --> 22:50.403
- JIM IS TRYING TO PLAY
A GAME WITH ME.

22:50.437 --> 22:53.540
HIS GOAL IS TO TEAR
MY WHOLE APARTMENT APART.

22:53.573 --> 22:55.108
- THIS IS PRETTY SMALL
FOR A MASTER, ISN'T IT?

22:55.108 --> 22:57.110
YEAH.
HAVE YOU SEEN MY UNIT?

22:57.110 --> 22:59.546
BECAUSE IT--IT'S, LIKE,
NIGHT AND DAY, COMPARED TO THIS.

22:59.579 --> 23:01.748
- BUT I-I KNOW BETTER.

23:01.781 --> 23:04.217
IF HE WANTS TO EXPAND
HIS APARTMENT,

23:04.250 --> 23:06.820
HE'S GOT NOWHERE TO GO
BUT TO ME.

23:06.853 --> 23:08.722
AS TERRIBLE AS YOU THINK THIS
APARTMENT IS COMPARED TO YOURS,

23:08.755 --> 23:10.457
THIS IS SOMETHING YOUR APARTMENT
DOES NOT HAVE.

23:10.490 --> 23:11.791
YOU DON'T HAVE
THOSE EASTERN VIEWS.

23:11.825 --> 23:12.859
- RIGHT.

23:12.892 --> 23:14.094
- SO YOU GET THE--
THE SUNRISE VIEW.

23:14.127 --> 23:15.762
- THAT'S ATTRACTIVE.

23:15.795 --> 23:18.231
* *

23:18.264 --> 23:20.066
- REALISTICALLY,
RAISING THE PRICE

23:20.100 --> 23:24.838
AFTER NO ACTION TWO YEARS
SOUNDS LIKE A SCAM.

23:24.871 --> 23:25.905
WE'RE PRETTY MUCH THE ONLY
CONTENDERS YOU HAVE

23:25.939 --> 23:26.906
FOR THIS APARTMENT.

23:26.940 --> 23:28.108
- OH, I DON'T THINK SO.

23:28.141 --> 23:30.243
OREN IS OVER-CONFIDENT

23:30.276 --> 23:32.345
BECAUSE THE APARTMENT'S BEEN ON
THE MARKET FOR TWO YEARS

23:32.379 --> 23:34.647
AND THERE HASN'T BEEN
ANY INTEREST,

23:34.681 --> 23:36.149
BUT WHAT THEY DON'T KNOW

23:36.182 --> 23:39.452
IS THAT MY MARKETING STRATEGY
HASN'T EVEN BEGUN.

23:39.486 --> 23:40.754
GOOD TO MEET YOU.

23:40.787 --> 23:41.788
- GOOD JOB. YOU HAVE
A NICE LISTING THERE.

23:41.821 --> 23:43.523
GOOD LUCK.
- GOOD SEEING YOU, RYAN.

23:43.556 --> 23:46.459
[upbeat music]

23:46.493 --> 23:53.099
* *

23:53.099 --> 23:54.501
- WELCOME TO 16 MINETTA.

23:54.534 --> 23:56.803
IT'S A FULL TOWNHOUSE,
ABOUT 2,800 SQUARE FEET.

23:56.836 --> 23:58.271
- INTERESTING.

23:58.304 --> 24:00.073
SHAI REPRESENTS
FRANK AND SEBASTIAN,

24:00.106 --> 24:01.775
WHICH ARE THE OWNERS
OF THIS TOWNHOUSE

24:01.808 --> 24:04.077
THAT WAS ONCE ON THE MARKET
BUT NO LONGER IS.

24:04.110 --> 24:05.845
I DID NOT EXPECT THIS.

24:05.879 --> 24:08.148
- THIS IS LIKE NO OTHER
PROPERTY IN NEW YORK.

24:08.181 --> 24:10.417
LOOK AT THIS PLACE.

24:10.450 --> 24:12.419
- THIS IS
A PHENOMENAL HOUSE.

24:12.452 --> 24:13.820
- BEAUTIFUL, BEAUTIFUL.

24:13.853 --> 24:15.622
- THIS PLACE
IS CRAZY LOOKING.

24:15.655 --> 24:16.890
- I WANT YOU
TO MEET SOMEBODY.

24:16.923 --> 24:18.558
- WHAT'S UP?
NICE TO MEET YOU.

24:18.591 --> 24:20.493
YOU HAVE A PHENOMENAL PLACE.
- THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

24:20.527 --> 24:22.762
YOU'RE A BROKER TOO?
- YES, YES.

24:22.796 --> 24:24.064
I MEAN, I WOULD LIKE
TO SEE THE PLACE.

24:24.064 --> 24:26.299
- YEAH, WE'D LOVE TO
SHOW YOU AROUND.

24:26.332 --> 24:28.735
- WHEN HE AND I
FIRST BOUGHT THE PLACE,

24:28.768 --> 24:31.104
THIS ROOM WAS FILLED
WITH PLANTS.

24:31.137 --> 24:32.172
- PLANTS.

24:32.205 --> 24:34.107
- IT WAS LIKE
A RAIN FOREST IN HERE.

24:34.140 --> 24:35.375
- THIS IS
THE LITTLE BEDROOM.

24:35.408 --> 24:36.810
- THIS IS WHERE
THE MAGIC HAPPENS FOR HIM.

24:36.843 --> 24:38.545
- SO, NO--NO DOORS
IN THE BEDROOMS?

24:38.578 --> 24:39.846
- NO DOORS IN THE BEDROOM.

24:39.879 --> 24:43.316
- THIS PLACE IS PERFECT
FOR ADAM AND LOUISE.

24:43.350 --> 24:45.118
- WE ALSO HAVE AN OPEN SHOWER.
COME ON IN HERE.

24:45.151 --> 24:46.653
- NO!

24:46.686 --> 24:49.389
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL TOWNHOUSE IN
THE HEART OF THE WEST VILLAGE,

24:49.422 --> 24:51.191
IT'S 25 FOOT WIDE,

24:51.224 --> 24:54.594
AND AS AN ARCHITECT,
IT'S JUST A PHENOMENAL CANVAS

24:54.627 --> 24:56.396
FOR HIM TO DO
HIS DREAM HOME.

24:56.429 --> 24:57.664
WOW!
- SO THIS IS THE DUNGEON.

24:57.697 --> 24:58.932
- THIS IS LIKE
THE BAT CAVE.

24:58.965 --> 25:00.400
[laughter]

25:00.433 --> 25:02.135
- I CANNOT LOSE
THIS OPPORTUNITY.

25:02.168 --> 25:06.473
I WASN'T EXPECTING THIS
AT ALL.

25:06.506 --> 25:07.540
SO, WHAT'S--WHAT'S, UH,

25:07.574 --> 25:09.542
WHY DID YOU TAKE IT OFF
THE MARKET?

25:09.576 --> 25:11.811
- WE TOOK IT OFF THE MARKET
BECAUSE WE WERE DEALING WITH,

25:11.845 --> 25:13.780
YOU KNOW, A BUNCH OF BROKERS
COMING AT US WITH,

25:13.813 --> 25:16.649
YOU KNOW, ANYTHING--
THEY WERE COMING AT US

25:16.683 --> 25:18.051
WITH ALL DIFFERENT
KINDS OF OFFERS

25:18.051 --> 25:20.053
THAT JUST WEREN'T RIGHT
FOR US, SO WE SAID, YOU KNOW,

25:20.053 --> 25:21.821
AT THAT PRICE,
WE'RE NOT GONNA SELL IT,

25:21.855 --> 25:23.223
SO WE JUST MIGHT AS WELL
TAKE IT OFF THE MARKET,

25:23.256 --> 25:24.724
SIT BACK,
HAVE SOME FUN WITH IT,

25:24.758 --> 25:25.725
AND ENJOY IT FOR A WHILE...

25:25.759 --> 25:26.893
- OKAY.

25:26.926 --> 25:28.762
- UNTIL PEOPLE REALIZE
WHAT A GEM IT IS.

25:28.795 --> 25:30.063
- YOU HAVE NO IDEA
HOW MUCH I'VE BEEN TRYING

25:30.063 --> 25:31.631
TO LOOK FOR SOMETHING SPECIAL
FOR THIS GUY.

25:31.664 --> 25:34.834
- WE'VE HEARD THIS BEFORE.
WE'VE HEARD THE SONG AND DANCE.

25:34.868 --> 25:37.170
- SO, WHAT--WHAT WOULD BE--
BUT JUST SO I KNOW,

25:37.203 --> 25:38.672
SO THAT WE ACTUALLY
DON'T GO BACK AND FORTH--

25:38.705 --> 25:40.073
- WHAT WOULD BE THE OFFER
FOR US TO WALK AWAY?

25:40.073 --> 25:42.676
I MEAN, SOMETHING THAT BOTH
OF US WOULD BE HAPPY WITH?

25:42.709 --> 25:45.779
PROBABLY 3.7.
- OKAY.

25:45.812 --> 25:47.213
AT A PRICE OF $3.7 MILLION,

25:47.247 --> 25:49.783
THAT COMES DOWN TO AN AVERAGE
OF $1,300 A FOOT.

25:49.816 --> 25:51.151
THAT IS A VERY GOOD DEAL.

25:51.184 --> 25:52.886
IF THIS PLACE
WOULD HAVE BEEN RENOVATED,

25:52.919 --> 25:54.154
IT WOULD HAVE COST,
I WOULD SAY,

25:54.187 --> 25:56.122
AROUND $2,500
PER SQUARE FOOT.

25:56.156 --> 25:59.659
BUT MOST BUYERS WOULD NOT
WANT TO BUY A PLACE LIKE THIS,

25:59.693 --> 26:01.628
BECAUSE IT JUST REQUIRES
SO MUCH WORK.

26:01.661 --> 26:05.398
SO, THE FACT THAT ADAM IS
AN ARCHITECT IS A HUGE BONUS.

26:05.432 --> 26:07.334
SO, IF I--
- YEAH.

26:07.367 --> 26:09.035
- IF I BRING A BUYER AND
WE GIVE YOU THE 3.7 OFFER,

26:09.069 --> 26:11.104
NO, LIKE, BULL[bleep],
NO GOING BACK AND FORTH,

26:11.137 --> 26:14.040
THEN WE, UH,
WE CAN MAKE A DEAL?

26:14.074 --> 26:18.678
- FOR 3.7? YEAH.
YEAH, WE WILL.

26:18.712 --> 26:21.481
- NOW I JUST HAVE TO BRING ADAM
AND LOUISE TO SEE THIS HOUSE,

26:21.514 --> 26:25.151
AND THEN JUST CLOSE THE DEAL.

26:25.185 --> 26:26.886
I APPRECIATE IT, MAN, REALLY.
- IT'S NOTHING.

26:26.920 --> 26:28.355
- IT'S A PLEASURE, SIR.
- YES, YES.

26:28.388 --> 26:29.689
- ALL RIGHT, GO DRINK.

26:29.723 --> 26:32.058
- YEAH, I WOULD LIKE, ACTUALLY,
TO HAVE A DRINK.

26:32.058 --> 26:35.061

26:35.061 --> 26:38.498

26:38.531 --> 26:41.134
- YOU KNOW THE PASSWORD?
- THE ALCHEMIST.

26:41.167 --> 26:44.304
- PERFECT.
* *

26:44.337 --> 26:47.974
- TONIGHT IS MY BIG MASQUERADE
PARTY AT THE PARK IMPERIAL.

26:48.074 --> 26:49.442
NICE MASK.

26:49.476 --> 26:52.746
THIS IS A LISTING THAT FEELS
SO STALE AND OVERPRICED,

26:52.779 --> 26:58.585
SO MY OBJECTIVE IS TO GO BIG
AND CREATE A RIDICULOUS BUZZ.

26:58.618 --> 27:00.353
IN THIS PENTHOUSE,
YOU ARE LITERALLY,

27:00.387 --> 27:01.788
YOU'RE LIKE
THE KING OF THE WORLD,

27:01.821 --> 27:03.256
AND YOU CAN
WAKE UP IN THAT BED

27:03.289 --> 27:04.791
WITH WHOMEVER
YOU GO TO BED WITH,

27:04.824 --> 27:06.459
AND THIS IS YOUR VIEW.

27:06.493 --> 27:08.161
FROM THE LIVING ROOM,
THE MASTER BEDROOM,

27:08.194 --> 27:09.362
AND THE SECOND BEDROOM,

27:09.396 --> 27:11.131
ALL YOU'RE LOOKING AT
IS CENTRAL PARK.

27:11.164 --> 27:12.565
- RIGHT.

27:12.599 --> 27:13.733
- AND THEN, WHEN YOU'RE NOT
LOOKING AT CENTRAL PARK,

27:13.767 --> 27:15.802
YOU'RE LOOKING AT
TITS AND ASS.

27:15.835 --> 27:16.936
- [laughs]

27:17.037 --> 27:20.206
- NAME?
- OREN ALEXANDER.

27:20.240 --> 27:23.143
- YOU'RE NOT ON THE LIST, MAN.
DO YOU KNOW THE PASSWORD?

27:23.176 --> 27:25.945
- I DON'T KNOW THE PASSWORD.

27:26.046 --> 27:27.881
- THERE'S A WHO OUTSIDE?

27:27.914 --> 27:30.884
- OREN ALEXANDER.

27:30.917 --> 27:33.053
- ALL RIGHT,
LET'S TALK TO HIM.

27:35.755 --> 27:37.490
NICE MASK.
- THANK YOU.

27:37.524 --> 27:39.726
- THE FACT THAT OREN
HAS SHOWED UP

27:39.759 --> 27:42.962
AND GONE OUT OF HIS WAY
AND HE'S ACTUALLY DRESSED UP

27:43.063 --> 27:44.230
AND HE BROUGHT A MASK...

27:44.264 --> 27:45.432
I'M SORRY
I DIDN'T INVITE YOU.

27:45.465 --> 27:46.966
I JUST--I LOOKED AT THE LIST
OF TOP BROKERS

27:47.067 --> 27:48.068
AND DIDN'T SEE YOU
ON THERE.

27:48.068 --> 27:50.070
THIS LITTLE [bleep]
WANTS SOMETHING.

27:50.070 --> 27:51.604
- WHERE'D YOU GET
ALL THESE PEOPLE FROM?

27:51.638 --> 27:53.540
ARE THEY HERE 'CAUSE THEY'RE
INTERESTED IN THE PROPERTY,

27:53.573 --> 27:55.775
OR THEY'RE HERE FOR, UH,
A FREE SHOW?

27:55.809 --> 27:57.143
- THEY'RE INTERESTED
IN THE PROPERTY.

27:57.177 --> 27:59.312
- IT TOOK ALL OF TWO YEARS
FOR THEM TO GET INTERESTED?

27:59.346 --> 28:00.780
- I DIDN'T HAVE THE LISTING
FOR TWO YEARS.

28:00.814 --> 28:04.017
- LIKE, IT'S MORE STALE THAN
A PACKAGE OF DRIED FRUIT.

28:06.686 --> 28:09.122
I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE A SHOT
AT SELLING THIS APARTMENT.

28:09.155 --> 28:10.390
- OH, YEAH?

28:10.423 --> 28:12.125
- I'M THE ONLY ONE
WHO HAS A REAL CLIENT.

28:12.158 --> 28:13.660
- [laughs]

28:13.693 --> 28:15.528
EVERYONE HAS TOLD ME THAT
I'M NOT GONNA SELL THIS.

28:15.562 --> 28:19.733
OREN JUST VOCALIZES IT
TEN TIMES OVER

28:19.766 --> 28:21.101
BECAUSE HE'S INSECURE.

28:21.134 --> 28:22.569
I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE HE WAS
BEATEN AS A KID.

28:22.602 --> 28:24.738
I REALLY DON'T KNOW.
HERE'S THE DEAL.

28:24.771 --> 28:26.806
YOU CAN GO BACK TO JIM AND YOU
CAN TELL HIM THERE'S INTEREST

28:26.840 --> 28:28.608
AND THAT IF HE WANTS TO
MAKE A MOVE,

28:28.641 --> 28:32.612
HE SHOULD MAKE A MOVE NOW,
BECAUSE TIME IS SLIPPING AWAY.

28:32.645 --> 28:33.813
AND I'LL DO A DEAL.

28:33.847 --> 28:35.482
I'LL DO A GOOD DEAL,
FOR YOU ESPECIALLY,

28:35.515 --> 28:37.951
BECAUSE I LIKE YOU SO MUCH AND I
THINK YOU'RE SO GOOD LOOKING.

28:42.789 --> 28:45.291

28:45.325 --> 28:47.160
- WE SHOULD GO...
- AFTER YOU, MAN.

28:47.193 --> 28:49.696
- DANCE SOME SALSA FIRST.
- [laughs]

28:49.729 --> 28:52.766

28:52.799 --> 28:54.768
- AS MUCH AS I BELIEVE
IN WORKING HARD,

28:54.801 --> 28:58.438
I ALSO BELIEVE IN FEEDING
MY SOUL AND LIVING MY LIFE.

28:58.471 --> 28:59.539
- CHEERS.

28:59.572 --> 29:01.041
- AND THERE IS NOBODY
IN THIS WORLD

29:01.074 --> 29:03.109
THAT I HAVE MORE FUN WITH
THAN WITH MY TWIN BROTHER.

29:03.143 --> 29:05.211
- I'M HERE TO REMIND US
OF WHERE WE CAME FROM,

29:05.245 --> 29:07.147
AND YOU'RE HERE
TO MAKE US FORGET.

29:07.180 --> 29:09.449
[laughter]

29:09.482 --> 29:11.017
- I LOVE THAT!

29:11.017 --> 29:12.786
I DID NOT COME TO NEW YORK
BY MYSELF.

29:12.819 --> 29:15.055
I CAME WITH MY TWIN BROTHER,
DANIEL.

29:15.088 --> 29:17.357
I WANT TO DANCE WITH YOU
IN A LITTLE BIT, FOR SURE.

29:17.390 --> 29:19.025
DANIEL WORKS ON WALL STREET,

29:19.025 --> 29:21.928
AND HE IS THE BEST PERSON
I HAVE EVER MET IN MY LIFE.

29:22.028 --> 29:22.929
[laughter]

29:23.029 --> 29:24.531
I WOULD DIE FOR THAT GUY.

29:24.564 --> 29:26.733
YOU KNOW WHAT?
LET'S JUST DANCE.

29:26.766 --> 29:28.868

29:28.902 --> 29:32.372
MY BROTHER AND I LEFT
PUERTO RICO AT THE AGE OF 16.

29:32.405 --> 29:35.809
OUR PARENTS ARE LAWYERS,
AND THEY'RE VERY TRADITIONAL.

29:35.842 --> 29:39.412
THEY WANTED US TO GO
INTO A CAREER THAT WAS SAFE,

29:39.446 --> 29:40.413
AND I DON'T LIKE SAFE.

29:40.447 --> 29:42.048
I LIKE TO ROLL THE DICE.

29:42.048 --> 29:44.084
AND I SAID ONE DAY,
"I'M GOING TO THE BEACH."

29:44.117 --> 29:47.487
I WROTE A LETTER, PUT IT ON
THE DINING TABLE OF MY ROOM,

29:47.520 --> 29:49.622
FLEW TO MIAMI, AND EVERYTHING
ELSE WAS HISTORY.

29:49.656 --> 29:51.057
[speaking Spanish]

29:51.057 --> 29:54.060
I LOVE YOU.

29:54.060 --> 29:56.763
[laughs]

29:56.796 --> 29:58.431
- COMING UP...

29:58.465 --> 29:59.566
- I WANT AN APOLOGY.

29:59.599 --> 30:00.834
- TALK SLOWLY,
BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND

30:00.867 --> 30:02.235
THAT ENGLISH
IS YOUR SECOND LANGUAGE.

30:02.268 --> 30:04.304
- WE--WE DISCUSSED THIS.
COME ON.

30:04.337 --> 30:06.439
IT HURTS MY WORD.
LIKE, I TOLD THEM.

30:06.473 --> 30:07.774
- BUT THIS IS REAL ESTATE.

30:17.283 --> 30:18.785
- YEP, YEP, YEP.
- OKAY.

30:18.818 --> 30:20.587
- THERE'S SO MUCH TRAFFIC
IN THIS CITY.

30:20.620 --> 30:21.855
- I'LL SAY.

30:21.888 --> 30:23.256
- I'M SO BUSY
WITH WORK THESE DAYS

30:23.289 --> 30:26.793
THAT I HAVE TO COME UP WITH
CREATIVE WAYS TO MEET WOMEN,

30:26.826 --> 30:28.928
LIKE WHILE I'M SITTING
IN TRAFFIC.

30:28.962 --> 30:30.797
WAIT. DON'T HIT HER.
OH, WAIT. DO HIT HER.

30:30.830 --> 30:33.800
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
- NAH. HOW ABOUT THIS ONE?

30:33.833 --> 30:36.069
OH, SHE'S PREGNANT.

BUT WITH AN ESCALADE.

OH, MY GOD.
- HERE WE GO, HERE WE GO.

30:40.740 --> 30:41.808
- THE BEIGE DRESS.

SLEPT WITH A WOMAN?

- I HOPE YOU'RE KIDDING.
- WHAT?

31:11.071 --> 31:13.673
THAT'S A LEGITIMATE QUESTION.
- OH, MAN.

31:13.707 --> 31:17.477

31:40.266 --> 31:42.268
YOU CAN READ NUMBERS?

31:45.138 --> 31:46.573
OKAY.

31:46.606 --> 31:48.575
MY PLAN IS WORKING.

31:48.608 --> 31:50.910
ANY OFFER ON THIS APARTMENT
RIGHT NOW IS GREAT,

31:50.944 --> 31:52.679
BECAUSE IT'LL SHOW
TO THE SELLERS

31:52.712 --> 31:54.114
THAT I'M DOING MY JOB.

31:54.114 --> 31:55.915
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THEY
HAVEN'T GOTTEN

31:55.949 --> 31:57.851
IN OVER TWO YEARS.
THAT'S AWESOME.

31:57.884 --> 32:01.321
I'M GONNA CONTACT THE SELLER,
AND I'LL GET BACK TO YOU.

32:01.354 --> 32:05.058

YOU KNOW UNDER HOW MUCH
PRESSURE I AM.

32:15.969 --> 32:17.971
I NEED TO SELL THAT.

32:20.373 --> 32:22.142
WELL, IT'S NOT WORKING OUT
UNTIL IT'S SOLD.

32:22.175 --> 32:23.576
UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES,

32:23.610 --> 32:26.079
YOU WOULD HAVE SIX MONTHS
TO SELL A PLACE LIKE THIS.

32:26.079 --> 32:27.580
I HAVE 15 DAYS.

32:27.614 --> 32:28.948
THIS IS TOP PRIORITY,

32:28.982 --> 32:30.750
THE WHOLE TEAM NEEDS TO BE
ON THIS MARBLE HOUSE.

32:30.784 --> 32:33.953

FOUR, SIX. IT'S CRAZY.

ONE MINUTE. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

CAN I HELP YOU?
- I'M GOOD.

LET YOU IN HERE?

32:53.173 --> 32:55.442
- I LET MYSELF IN, OKAY?
HOW'S THAT?

32:55.475 --> 32:56.710
- OLIVIA, DOES FREDRIK
HAVE AN APPOINTMENT?

32:56.743 --> 32:59.512
- NO.
- DO YOU--WHAT DO YOU WANT?

32:59.546 --> 33:04.250
- WHAT HAPPENED AT MY BROKER'S
OPEN IS NOT REALLY ACCEPTABLE.

33:04.284 --> 33:05.685
TELL ME, WHY--
WHY DID YOU DO IT?

33:05.719 --> 33:06.853
- WHY'D I DO WHAT?
I'M LOST.

33:06.886 --> 33:08.922
- YOU JUMPED IN THE POOL.
- UH-HUH.

33:08.955 --> 33:12.192
- I CAN'T--I CAN'T--MY MIND
CAN'T WRAP ITSELF--WHY?

33:12.225 --> 33:14.527
IT'S LIKE, WHAT IF MY SELLER
KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON?

33:14.561 --> 33:15.762
- I THOUGHT I WAS
DOING YOU A FAVOR,

33:15.795 --> 33:17.063
SHOWING YOU HOW THE POOL
WORKED.

33:17.063 --> 33:20.400
- THE POOL WORKS.

33:20.433 --> 33:21.735
ALL THOSE BROKERS
DID NOT FORGET.

33:21.768 --> 33:24.270
YOU MADE A FOOL OUT OF YOURSELF,
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

33:24.304 --> 33:25.872
- IS THAT WHY YOU CAME HERE?
- YEAH, TO SAVE YOU--

33:25.905 --> 33:28.108
TO SAVE YOU--
- OH, YOU CARE ABOUT ME?

33:28.141 --> 33:30.076
- FROM THIS, LIKE--
- OH, YOU CARE ABOUT ME NOW?

33:30.076 --> 33:31.544
- FROM THIS INSANITY, LIKE--
- YOU CARE ABOUT ME NOW?

33:31.578 --> 33:33.546
DO YOU--ARE YOU TRYING
TO DATE ME?

33:33.580 --> 33:34.681
IS THAT WHY YOU'RE HERE?

33:34.714 --> 33:35.982
BECAUSE I TOOK
MY CLOTHES OFF

33:36.082 --> 33:37.350
AND YOU WERE SAD I DIDN'T
TAKE MY PANTS OFF?

33:37.384 --> 33:40.086
- RYAN, NOT EVERYONE
IN THE WORLD

33:40.120 --> 33:41.621
FINDS YOU THAT ATTRACTIVE.

33:41.654 --> 33:43.089
- WELL, I'LL TALK SLOWLY,
BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND

33:43.089 --> 33:44.224
THAT ENGLISH
IS YOUR SECOND LANGUAGE.

33:44.257 --> 33:47.761
UM, YOU CAME UP TO ME,
PRIOR.

33:47.794 --> 33:50.430
YOU WERE SNIPPY
AND BITTER WITH ME.

33:50.463 --> 33:52.565
- OH, WHATEVER. COME ON.
GET OVER YOURSELF.

33:52.599 --> 33:53.767
- GET OVER MYSELF?

33:53.800 --> 33:55.101
YOU JUST MARCHED INTO
MY [bleep] OFFICE,

33:55.135 --> 33:56.503
AND YOU COME HERE AND YOU TRY
TO TELL ME WHAT TO DO.

33:56.536 --> 33:58.304
- OKAY, THIS IS NOT GOING
ANYWHERE, IS IT?

33:58.338 --> 33:59.773
YOU AND I ARE NEVER
GONNA COMMUNICATE.

33:59.806 --> 34:01.107
- I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHERE THIS WAS GOING

34:01.141 --> 34:02.409
FROM THE FIRST PLACE.

34:02.442 --> 34:03.610
I'M WORKING.
- OKAY, IT'S VERY SIMPLE, RYAN.

34:03.643 --> 34:05.578
I WALK INTO YOUR OFFICE.
I WANT AN APOLOGY.

34:05.612 --> 34:07.313
- I WANT AN APOLOGY FROM YOU.
- WHY?

34:07.347 --> 34:09.516
- FOR EVERY TIME YOU'RE IN FRONT
OF ME, FOR GIVING ME [bleep].

34:09.549 --> 34:10.684
- YOU CAN DO
WHATEVER YOU WANT.

34:10.717 --> 34:12.252
THAT'S MY POINT, I GUESS,
FOR COMING HERE.

34:12.285 --> 34:14.054
DO WHATEVER YOU WANT,
BUT I'M TELLING YOU RIGHT NOW,

34:14.087 --> 34:17.190
DON'T EVER COME TO
ONE OF MY OPEN HOUSES AGAIN.

34:27.067 --> 34:29.402
- THERE THEY ARE.
THANK YOU, GUYS, FOR COMING.

34:29.436 --> 34:31.204
HOW ARE YOU, ADAM? A PLEASURE.
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.

34:31.237 --> 34:32.672
- HELLO. GOOD SEEING YOU.
- MWAH!

34:32.706 --> 34:34.507
I HAVE FOUND WHAT I BELIEVE
HAS BEEN MY BIGGEST DISCOVERY

34:34.541 --> 34:35.875
IN MY ENTIRE CAREER.

34:35.909 --> 34:39.279
LET'S GO SEE INSIDE.
<i>SENOR!</i>SEBASTIAN.

34:39.312 --> 34:40.480
- HEY, WHAT'S UP?

34:40.513 --> 34:41.915
- ADAM, LOUISE,
MEET SEBASTIAN,

34:41.948 --> 34:42.916
THE OWNER OF
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL HOME,

34:42.949 --> 34:44.150
WHICH YOU'RE ABOUT TO SEE.

34:44.184 --> 34:46.386
SO, UH, DO YOU MIND
IF I, UH--YES, ABSOLUTELY.

34:46.419 --> 34:48.088
SO, LET ME SHOW YOU AROUND.
- GO AHEAD.

34:48.121 --> 34:49.155
- THANKS A LOT.
- ENJOY.

34:55.195 --> 34:58.865
- WOW, THIS IS IMPRESSIVE.
- WOW.

35:01.801 --> 35:05.572
- YOU CAN SEE, UH, WHO'S TAKING
A SHOWER FROM THE LIVING ROOM.

35:05.605 --> 35:09.509
- OH, OKAY. WE'VE SEEN EACH
OTHER BEFORE. NO SURPRISES.

35:09.542 --> 35:12.312
THAT MUST BE 25-FOOT-HIGH
CEILINGS.

35:12.345 --> 35:14.647
- IT'S 25-FOOT CEILINGS.
- WOW.

35:14.681 --> 35:16.649
- RIGHT NOW, YOU CAN EITHER
BUILD ANOTHER FLOOR

35:16.683 --> 35:19.652
OR YOU CAN JUST
LEAVE IT OPEN.

35:19.686 --> 35:21.287
- I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED
BY THE BEAMS.

35:21.321 --> 35:22.555
THEY LOOK A LITTLE DRY-ROT,

35:22.589 --> 35:24.324
WHICH, AS AN ARCHITECT
AND CONTRACTOR,

35:24.357 --> 35:25.458
I KNOW WHAT
I'M GONNA DEAL WITH.

35:25.492 --> 35:27.794
CLICK, CLICK, CLICK.

35:27.827 --> 35:30.130
I'M SORT OF ADDING UP THE DOLLAR
SIGNS AS WE'RE GOING THROUGH.

35:30.163 --> 35:31.398
- WHAT DO YOU GUYS
THINK OF THE HOUSE?

35:31.431 --> 35:32.932
- IT'S GREAT.

35:32.966 --> 35:35.869
- IT'S A FUN HOUSE, AND IT'S
SINGS TO ME IN SOME WAYS.

35:35.902 --> 35:38.538
I MEAN, IT'S TOTALLY GOOFY
AND QUIRKY.

35:38.571 --> 35:39.873
THIS IS THAT LUMP OF CLAY

35:39.906 --> 35:41.808
THAT I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT
FOR YEARS.

35:41.841 --> 35:44.878
- I THINK WE--WELL,
YOU COULD DO A LOT.

35:44.911 --> 35:47.213
- IT REALLY DOES WORK FOR US.
- MM-HMM.

35:47.247 --> 35:50.283
- UM, FOR YOU GUYS TO TAKE THIS
HOUSE FROM THE OWNERS' HANDS,

35:50.316 --> 35:52.819
IT NEEDS TO BE AT FULL ASKING,
AT 3.7.

35:52.852 --> 35:55.822
[suspenseful music]

35:55.855 --> 35:57.090
* *

35:57.123 --> 36:00.093
- DO I GET TO SLEEP ON IT?

36:00.126 --> 36:02.429
- COME ON.
THERE'S NO THINKING ABOUT IT.

36:02.462 --> 36:05.031
TAKE IT NOW.

36:05.031 --> 36:06.232
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT YOU'VE
MISSED OUT ON BEFORE,

36:06.266 --> 36:08.935
BECAUSE YOUR BROKER
LET YOU THINK ABOUT IT.

36:09.035 --> 36:10.437
I'M NOT GONNA LET YOU
THINK ABOUT IT.

36:10.470 --> 36:12.305
- CAN WE TAKE THE NIGHT
AND SLEEP ON IT

36:12.339 --> 36:13.306
AND THEN GET BACK TO YOU?

36:13.340 --> 36:14.441
- OH, NO.

36:14.474 --> 36:15.675
THIS--IN THIS
PARTICULAR ONE,

36:15.709 --> 36:17.177
YOU HAVE MISSED
ON SO MANY TOWNHOUSES

36:17.210 --> 36:19.179
UNDER SOMEBODY ELSE'S WATCH.

36:19.212 --> 36:22.315
NOT THIS TIME.

36:22.349 --> 36:25.652
- ALL RIGHT. WELL,
I FEEL GOOD ABOUT IT.

36:25.685 --> 36:28.188
- IT SEEMS DOABLE.
- IT DOES SEEM DOABLE.

36:28.221 --> 36:30.123
- YEAH.
- YES?

36:30.156 --> 36:31.591
- YEAH.
- LET'S DO IT.

36:31.624 --> 36:33.860
- ALL RIGHT. SO,
I'LL BE BACK IN A SECOND.

36:35.562 --> 36:36.796
- WHAT'S UP, LUIS?

36:36.830 --> 36:38.331
- ALL RIGHT,
IT'S A PHENOMENAL PLACE,

36:38.365 --> 36:39.532
AND IT'S PERFECT FOR THEM.

36:39.566 --> 36:42.669
I THINK YOU WILL PROBABLY FIND
NO BETTER BUYER.

36:42.702 --> 36:44.604
- THEY DEFINITELY WANT IT?
- YES.

36:44.637 --> 36:45.739
- ARE THEY GONNA GIVE US
THE FULL ASKING PRICE?

36:45.772 --> 36:46.906
- YES.

36:46.940 --> 36:48.408
- REALLY? THEY'RE REALLY,
REALLY SERIOUS?

36:48.441 --> 36:49.809
- YEAH, THEY ARE
VERY SERIOUS BUYERS.

36:49.843 --> 36:51.678
HE IS AN ARCHITECT HIMSELF,

36:51.711 --> 36:52.946
SO HE IS ONE OF
THE VERY FEW BUYERS

36:52.979 --> 36:55.682
THAT WOULD ACTUALLY SEE
THE POTENTIAL OF THIS HOME.

36:55.715 --> 36:56.950
- SO, THEY REALLY WANT IT.

36:56.983 --> 36:58.618
IT SEEMS LIKE THEY
REALLY, REALLY WANT IT. OKAY.

36:58.651 --> 37:00.487
- I NORMALLY DON'T BELIEVE
THAT THINGS ARE MEANT TO BE,

37:00.520 --> 37:01.888
BUT IN THIS CASE,
IT ACTUALLY DOES.

37:04.457 --> 37:06.760
- 3.7?
- YES.

37:06.793 --> 37:08.628
THAT'S--THAT'S WHAT--
THAT WAS WHAT WE DISCUSSED.

37:08.661 --> 37:11.831
- YOU KNOW WHAT? I PUT A LOT OF
MONEY INTO IT TOO.

37:11.865 --> 37:17.771
WHAT DO YOU SAY?
GO ANOTHER 100 ON THAT?

37:17.804 --> 37:19.572
- COME ON.
- DO ANOTHER 100? 3.8?

37:19.606 --> 37:22.108
- NO. WE--WE--
WE DISCUSSED THIS.

37:22.142 --> 37:23.510
- YOU KNOW, THEY SPENT
A LOT OF TIME IN HERE.

37:23.543 --> 37:25.779
ANOTHER 100, ANOTHER 100.
- NO.

37:25.812 --> 37:27.447
- ANOTHER 100?

37:27.480 --> 37:28.682
- YOU CAN'T PUT ME
ON THE SPOT.

37:28.715 --> 37:30.116
YOU KNOW, I BROUGHT 'EM--

37:30.150 --> 37:31.317
- THEY SEEM LIKE
THEY REALLY WANT IT.

37:31.351 --> 37:34.387
- IN AN OFF-MARKET DEAL,
THERE ARE NO RULES.

37:34.421 --> 37:36.656
THE SELLER CAN PRETTY MUCH DO
WHATEVER HE WANTS.

37:36.690 --> 37:38.525
AND APPARENTLY,
HE WANTS TO BE A DOUCHEBAG.

37:38.558 --> 37:39.926
- LISTEN, ANOTHER 100,000
WOULDN'T HURT.

37:39.959 --> 37:41.895
- WHAT'S 100?
- YEAH, BUT IT HURTS MY WORD.

37:41.928 --> 37:43.063
LIKE, I TOLD THEM THAT--

37:43.096 --> 37:44.531
- OH, YOU GAVE YOUR WORD
ALREADY?

37:44.564 --> 37:47.133
- YEAH, I TOLD THEM--
- BUT THIS IS REAL ESTATE.

37:58.511 --> 38:00.013
- NO, I KNOW THE NUMBER
WE NEED TO REACH.

38:00.013 --> 38:01.481
I THINK THIS IS OUR GUY,

38:01.514 --> 38:03.350
SO I'M ACTUALLY ABOUT TO
SEE THE BROKER RIGHT NOW.

38:03.383 --> 38:05.552
LET ME TALK TO HIM
AND SEE WHAT I CAN DO.

38:05.585 --> 38:07.554
IT'S FASHION WEEK
IN NEW YORK CITY,

38:07.587 --> 38:10.623
AND I'VE BEEN APPROACHED TO WALK
FOR RICHARD SMITH.

38:10.657 --> 38:12.425
DO I CHECK IN WITH SOMEBODY?
- ARE YOU A MODEL?

38:12.459 --> 38:14.894
- NOT RE--I MEAN, NOT REALLY,
BUT YES, TODAY.

38:14.928 --> 38:16.563
- [laughs]
I LIKE THAT.

38:16.596 --> 38:18.098
- THE CONCEPT THAT HE HAS

38:18.131 --> 38:24.704
IS TO HAVE THE TOP BROKERS IN
NEW YORK CITY WALK IN THE SHOW.

38:24.738 --> 38:26.840
- WHAT'S GOING ON?
- WHAT'S UP?

38:26.873 --> 38:28.041
- LOOKING PRETTY.

38:28.041 --> 38:29.309
- THANKS FOR THE OFFER,
BY THE WAY.

38:29.342 --> 38:31.044
- YEAH? ARE WE GONNA
MAKE A DEAL?

38:31.077 --> 38:32.712
- MAYBE.

38:32.746 --> 38:37.384
I JUST SPOKE TO THEM
AND THEY'LL COME TO 8.

38:37.417 --> 38:40.120
THAT'S IT.

38:40.153 --> 38:42.522
- STILL--WE STILL GOT
A LONG WAY TO GO.

38:42.555 --> 38:44.190
IT'S STILL A BIG GAP
TO CLOSE.

38:44.224 --> 38:47.327
TO BE FRANK WITH YOU, I THINK
WE'RE TOO FAR TO MAKE A DEAL.

38:47.360 --> 38:49.662
- WELL, TALK TO HIM.
SEE WHAT HE SAYS.

38:49.696 --> 38:51.598
- ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE FINISHED.
- DONE? LOOK GOOD?

38:51.631 --> 38:55.468
I'M GONNA GO GET DRESSED.
MAKE THE CALL. LET ME KNOW.

38:55.502 --> 38:58.471
[upbeat music]

38:58.505 --> 39:02.342

39:02.375 --> 39:04.144
I KNOW THE FASHION SHOW
HAS STARTED

39:04.177 --> 39:06.279
AND I HAVE TO WALK
IN 15 MINUTES,

39:06.312 --> 39:07.614
BUT I'VE GOT OREN HERE.

39:07.647 --> 39:09.816
I WANT TO GET THIS DEAL
DONE NOW.

39:09.849 --> 39:12.686
IS IT THE IDEAL TIME
TO NEGOTIATE A DEAL?

39:12.719 --> 39:14.020
OF COURSE NOT.

39:14.020 --> 39:16.022
BUT IF OREN SAYS
HIS BUYER IS SERIOUS,

39:16.022 --> 39:17.424
LET'S SEE
HOW SERIOUS HE IS.

39:17.457 --> 39:20.894
[overlapping chatter]

39:20.927 --> 39:22.395
- SO, I SPOKE
TO MY CLIENT,

39:22.429 --> 39:26.833
AND I SQUEEZED HIM,
BUT ONLY FOR A LITTLE BIT.

39:26.866 --> 39:28.234
7.25.

39:28.268 --> 39:31.237
- YOU'RE KILLING ME.
WE CAN'T DO 7.25.

39:31.271 --> 39:32.539
- LET'S--LET'S BE HONEST.

39:32.572 --> 39:34.708
THIS THING HAS BEEN STALE
FOR TWO YEARS NOW.

39:34.741 --> 39:35.709
- YEAH.

39:35.742 --> 39:36.710
- I SUGGEST YOU COME DOWN.

39:36.743 --> 39:37.944
- [groans]

39:38.044 --> 39:40.513
UM, THEY WON'T DO 7.25.

39:40.547 --> 39:41.848
I'LL CALL THEM,
BUT THEY'RE NOT GONNA DO IT.

39:41.881 --> 39:43.183
- IT'S YOUR JOB
TO GET 'EM DOWN.

39:43.216 --> 39:45.518
- I'LL CALL THEM RIGHT NOW.
GIVE ME ONE SECOND.

39:45.552 --> 39:46.920
[phone ringing]

39:48.455 --> 39:51.524
GOOD. I JUST SPOKE WITH
THE BUYER'S BROKER,

39:51.558 --> 39:55.662
AND THEY'VE COME BACK
AT 7,250,000.

39:59.899 --> 40:02.635
NO. I KNOW 7,250,000
IS TOO LOW,

40:02.669 --> 40:05.271
AND WE'RE NOT TAKING THAT,
BUT THIS IS OUR GUY.

40:05.305 --> 40:07.140
I REALLY, REALLY THINK
WE CAN GET HIM.

40:07.173 --> 40:09.709
YOUR CLIENT PAID, WHAT?
6 MILLION FOR THIS?

40:09.743 --> 40:11.678
YOU'RE STILL MAKING
A PRETTY GOOD RETURN

40:11.711 --> 40:14.080
ON AN APARTMENT
HE HASN'T DONE ANY WORK TO.

40:14.114 --> 40:16.983
I JUST NEED
A LITTLE BIT MORE.

40:30.330 --> 40:32.332
I'LL GET IT DONE.

40:50.984 --> 40:52.919
- WHEN YOU GO INTO A BEST
AND FINAL SITUATION,

40:52.952 --> 40:55.021
THE RISK IS THAT YOU'RE GONNA
LOSE THE DEAL.

40:55.055 --> 40:56.256
I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE
WITH HIM.

40:56.289 --> 40:59.025
7.75. THAT'S IT.
THAT'S IT.

40:59.059 --> 41:00.293
I DIDN'T THINK
THEY WERE GONNA MOVE OFF 8,

41:00.326 --> 41:02.162
BUT THEY'LL DO 7.75.

41:02.195 --> 41:03.496
SOMETIMES YOU JUST NEED TO
SLAM THE BOOK DOWN

41:03.530 --> 41:05.865
AND SAY, "LOOK, THIS IS IT.
THIS IS THE NUMBER.

41:05.899 --> 41:07.634
TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT."

41:07.667 --> 41:09.903
IF HE WANTS THE APARTMENT,
HE WANTS $1/2 MILLION.

41:09.936 --> 41:11.604
- NOT GOOD ENOUGH.
- HE'S NOT PAYING FULL ASK.

41:11.638 --> 41:14.174
HE'S NOW PAYING $1 MILLION LESS
THAN WHERE I'VE PRICED IT.

41:14.207 --> 41:15.375
- IT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH.

41:15.408 --> 41:16.910
HE MIGHT NOT WANT TO MAKE
THE DEAL.

41:16.943 --> 41:18.078
SO, LET ME SEE
WHAT I CAN DO.

41:18.078 --> 41:21.314
- I'M PUSHING FOR YOU,
OKAY?

41:21.348 --> 41:23.917
- LINE UP. SHOW TIME,
ONE MINUTE.

41:23.950 --> 41:25.952
GET YOUR PLACES.

41:31.291 --> 41:34.928
- 7.75. WE HAVE A DEAL.
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

41:34.961 --> 41:37.397
- DEAD SERIOUS.

41:37.430 --> 41:39.099
- LET'S DO THIS.

41:39.099 --> 41:40.867
HOLY [bleep],
I PULLED IT OFF.

41:40.900 --> 41:41.868
- LET'S GO.
- LET'S ROCK THIS.

41:41.901 --> 41:44.104
- LET'S GO.

41:44.104 --> 41:47.107
[upbeat music]

41:47.107 --> 41:50.210
* *

41:50.243 --> 41:54.748
- WALKING DOWN THE RUNWAY
IS SO MUCH EASIER,

41:54.781 --> 41:57.751
KNOWING THAT I'VE GOT
