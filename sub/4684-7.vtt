WEBVTT

00:01.666 --> 00:04.900
No, no, no!
Don't touch that dial.

00:04.966 --> 00:07.800
Here's what's
on my mind tonight.

00:10.066 --> 00:12.200
Rick's a DJ with a mean streak.

00:12.266 --> 00:13.933
Ow! That's gotta hurt.

00:14.000 --> 00:16.933
But his cutting remarks
could cost him his life.

00:17.000 --> 00:18.500
If I keep insulting people
all the time

00:18.566 --> 00:20.133
I'm gonna alienate
every listener we've got.

00:20.200 --> 00:21.366
That's ridiculous!

00:21.433 --> 00:23.233
'You're the man
everyone loves to hate.'

00:23.300 --> 00:26.466
Now, is this mime
a murderous listener?

00:26.533 --> 00:29.400
Or is Rick really just
fighting with himself?

00:29.466 --> 00:32.466
A mime is a terrible
thing to waste!

00:32.533 --> 00:34.833
Find out on
"Freddy's Nightmares."

00:55.066 --> 00:57.500
You're in Springwood now.

00:57.566 --> 00:59.000
And you're all mine.

01:28.266 --> 01:31.066
..the Q.

01:31.133 --> 01:32.866
'Listening to WOQ.'

01:32.933 --> 01:35.033
'The Big Q,
Springwood's big hits'

01:35.100 --> 01:36.700
'all the time station.'

01:36.766 --> 01:38.433
Rick Rake talkin' at you.

01:38.500 --> 01:39.566
I say what I think.

01:39.633 --> 01:41.166
And I think what I say.

01:41.233 --> 01:43.100
And right about now
I think it's time

01:43.166 --> 01:45.600
for another Rick's raking!

01:48.433 --> 01:50.266
Ow, that's gotta hurt!

01:50.333 --> 01:51.900
'And the victim for today
is once again'

01:51.966 --> 01:53.933
Mojo Mama, the mother of rap.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.833
Now, yesterday I called Mojo

01:55.900 --> 01:57.400
the queen of fat.

01:57.466 --> 02:00.066
I said, it took me three times
to just give her the once-over.

02:00.133 --> 02:01.300
Well, don't get me wrong, folks

02:01.366 --> 02:02.700
I haven't got anything
against fat people.

02:02.766 --> 02:05.700
It's just fat, ugly people
that I really hate.

02:05.766 --> 02:08.366
And Mojo Mama is U-G-L-Y.

02:08.433 --> 02:10.866
She ain't got no alibi.
She's ugly.

02:10.933 --> 02:12.366
And talent..

02:12.433 --> 02:13.800
Well, Mojo Mama has no talent.

02:13.866 --> 02:16.266
My mama is a better rapper
than Mojo Mama.

02:16.333 --> 02:17.633
I'm sorry, this is Rick Rake.

02:17.700 --> 02:19.033
And I say what I think

02:19.100 --> 02:21.000
and I think what I say.

02:21.066 --> 02:23.400
Right now here's
Daddy's Little Girl

02:23.466 --> 02:26.133
with "Stick Shift Of My Heart."

02:29.566 --> 02:31.400
Hey, boss, what's up?

02:31.466 --> 02:33.933
Uh, what was that?

02:34.000 --> 02:35.466
What, the raking?

02:35.533 --> 02:36.900
Yes, that raking.

02:36.966 --> 02:38.600
Is there a problem?

02:38.666 --> 02:41.900
You called the woman,
uh-uh, fat and ugly.

02:41.966 --> 02:43.500
Yeah. So?

02:43.566 --> 02:45.533
So I could do that myself.

02:45.600 --> 02:48.300
Now, I pay you to be creative
in your brutality.

02:48.366 --> 02:49.800
Where's that
cold-blooded cruelty

02:49.866 --> 02:51.300
that brings in
those great ratings?

02:51.366 --> 02:52.500
Yeah, well, I think
I better talk to you

02:52.566 --> 02:54.633
about that, Mr. Sexton.
You know..

02:54.700 --> 02:57.666
I really think I oughta
tone it down just a bit.

02:57.733 --> 03:00.700
- You're pulling my leg, right?
- No, I'm not.

03:00.766 --> 03:02.233
You know, I figure,
with the way I'm going

03:02.300 --> 03:04.700
if I keep insulting people
all the time, I'm gonna alienate

03:04.766 --> 03:06.566
every listener we've got
by next summer.

03:06.633 --> 03:08.666
That's ridiculous!

03:08.733 --> 03:11.066
Well, look at this.

03:11.133 --> 03:13.100
Look at this fan mail!

03:16.366 --> 03:18.300
I got news for you, boss.
That's not fan mail.

03:18.366 --> 03:20.600
- That's hate mail.
- Fan mail, hate mail.

03:20.666 --> 03:22.400
What's the difference?

03:22.466 --> 03:24.266
The point is,
people are taking the time

03:24.333 --> 03:25.366
to write these letters.

03:25.433 --> 03:26.966
That means they're listening!

03:27.033 --> 03:29.066
And that's what
the advertisers care about!

03:29.133 --> 03:31.733
'You're the man
everyone loves to hate!'

03:31.800 --> 03:33.100
Super.

03:33.766 --> 03:35.100
'Look, Rick.'

03:35.166 --> 03:37.533
'You've been a failure on
every station you've been on.'

03:39.000 --> 03:40.966
And now you're on top.

03:41.033 --> 03:42.766
It won't last long

03:42.833 --> 03:44.433
and it won't happen again.

03:44.500 --> 03:46.666
'So if I were you..'

03:46.733 --> 03:48.366
...I'd keep it going
as long as I can

03:48.433 --> 03:50.933
and enjoy it
as long as it lasts..

03:51.000 --> 03:52.033
...which may not be very long

03:52.100 --> 03:54.333
'since your contract is up
in a month.'

03:57.400 --> 03:58.400
Yeah? Can I help you?

03:58.466 --> 03:59.700
Delivery for Mr. Rick Rake.

03:59.766 --> 04:01.466
I was told
I could find him in here.

04:01.533 --> 04:02.700
He's busy,
but I'll take 'em.

04:02.766 --> 04:04.033
No, can't do, I've got orders

04:04.100 --> 04:06.100
to deliver them
directly to the man.

04:06.166 --> 04:08.200
Hm, well, okay.
Hold on one second.

04:09.833 --> 04:11.900
Yo, Rick, there's
a delivery dude out here

04:11.966 --> 04:14.133
with some flowers.

04:14.200 --> 04:16.633
You see that?
They love you.

04:16.700 --> 04:18.333
Send him in, young lady.

04:21.100 --> 04:22.433
Which one?

04:30.700 --> 04:31.966
'From Mojo Mama!'

04:32.033 --> 04:34.000
She says she loves your show!

04:37.000 --> 04:38.666
Wow! I didn't even
recognize him!

04:38.733 --> 04:41.833
But that was Matt, the Rat,
Mojo's drummer!

04:41.900 --> 04:43.100
'Oh, wow!'

04:43.166 --> 04:44.600
Oh, no,
don't-don't move, Rick!

04:44.666 --> 04:46.666
- This is great!
- What?

04:46.733 --> 04:48.700
We'll get photos,
put it out on the wire.

04:48.766 --> 04:50.733
It'll make great press.

04:50.800 --> 04:51.933
Oh, God!

04:53.833 --> 04:56.133
Hey, kids

04:56.200 --> 04:58.266
you're listening
to the hot sounds

04:58.333 --> 04:59.966
of Freddy, the king

05:00.033 --> 05:02.633
on WDED radio

05:02.700 --> 05:05.733
the station people
are just dying to hear.

05:05.800 --> 05:08.100
Yeah, we got your Hendrix.

05:08.166 --> 05:09.766
We got your Lennon.

05:09.833 --> 05:11.466
We got your Joplin.

05:11.533 --> 05:13.166
We got your Elvis.

05:13.233 --> 05:15.133
We got your Donny Osmond.

05:15.200 --> 05:17.000
When did he die? Ha!

05:17.066 --> 05:19.733
And I'm taking the fourth caller

05:19.800 --> 05:21.933
to win a free crypt for two

05:22.000 --> 05:23.933
at a graveyard near you.

05:26.900 --> 05:29.200
Today it was just a fist.
What if tomorrow it's a gun?

05:30.966 --> 05:33.133
You used to be so sweet!

05:33.200 --> 05:34.633
Now you just insult people
all day.

05:35.766 --> 05:37.866
- What happened to you?
- Nothing happened.

05:37.933 --> 05:41.466
Look, being rude is just part of
the radio personality.

05:41.533 --> 05:44.333
Oh, come on.
You know it's not the real me.

05:44.400 --> 05:46.700
It just started as a lark and..

05:46.766 --> 05:48.600
...now I'm stuck with it.

05:48.666 --> 05:50.200
Okay, then unlark.

05:50.266 --> 05:52.133
Why don't you start being
the sweet, polite Rick

05:52.200 --> 05:54.366
that you used to be on the air?

05:54.433 --> 05:57.766
Because the new Rick
gets better ratings.

05:57.833 --> 05:59.966
And better ratings
mean a better life

06:00.033 --> 06:01.733
for a et moi.

06:03.700 --> 06:05.300
You like that brand new car.

06:05.366 --> 06:07.166
I don't hear you
complaining about that

06:07.233 --> 06:09.700
or this new $500 bracelet

06:09.766 --> 06:12.133
that looks great on you.

06:15.400 --> 06:17.100
What if one of your
targets gets mad

06:17.166 --> 06:20.300
and does something...crazy

06:20.366 --> 06:22.233
Sheila, don't worry
about it, okay?

06:22.300 --> 06:25.133
Old man Sexton's gonna beef up
the security at the station.

06:25.200 --> 06:27.800
It, uh, it just
can't happen again.

06:27.866 --> 06:29.766
That's great. You'll be
protected at the station.

06:29.833 --> 06:32.833
What about home?
Or right here in the street?

06:32.900 --> 06:34.700
Sheila..

06:34.766 --> 06:37.066
Nothing is going to happen
to me.

06:37.133 --> 06:38.366
I'm not on TV,
I'm on the radio.

06:38.433 --> 06:41.233
Nobody knows what I
look like.

06:41.300 --> 06:43.366
And away from the station..

06:43.433 --> 06:45.400
...I blend in to the crowd.

06:46.466 --> 06:47.833
I hope so.

06:52.100 --> 06:54.033
Ooh, give me
some more of that.

07:00.400 --> 07:02.466
What's everybody lookin' at?

07:02.533 --> 07:04.100
Ah, who cares?

07:04.166 --> 07:06.166
Come on, let's go home.
I'm tired.

07:06.233 --> 07:08.200
- No, come on.
- Oh..

07:20.100 --> 07:21.133
Look.

07:27.300 --> 07:29.633
Hey, buddy,
I know you from somewhere.

07:29.700 --> 07:31.300
I doubt it.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.633
Hey, I know I know you.
Why do I know you?

07:42.700 --> 07:45.300
- You're on TV or something?
- No, I'm not on TV!

07:45.366 --> 07:48.133
Okay, we've never met.
I think I'd remember you.

07:54.500 --> 07:55.700
'Ow!'

07:57.366 --> 07:58.766
Awesome!

07:58.833 --> 08:01.200
The guy is pretty damn funny.

08:01.266 --> 08:02.500
Is that supposed to be funny?

08:02.566 --> 08:04.333
That's not funny.

08:04.400 --> 08:06.700
- Will you be quiet?
- Hey, I say what I think.

08:06.766 --> 08:08.533
"I think what I say."
I know, I know.

08:08.600 --> 08:10.000
Will you shut up for once?

08:10.066 --> 08:11.600
Hey, I heard that before.

08:11.666 --> 08:13.366
"I say what I think,
I think what I say."

08:13.433 --> 08:15.000
I heard that.

08:15.066 --> 08:16.833
Hey...you're somebody.

08:16.900 --> 08:19.833
No. I'm nobody, okay?
You're wrong.

08:19.900 --> 08:21.200
Now buzz off.

08:28.600 --> 08:30.200
Let's get out of here.

08:33.400 --> 08:35.400
I said, buzz off!

08:41.566 --> 08:43.533
'Are you okay, buddy?'

08:45.100 --> 08:46.766
I know who you are.

08:46.833 --> 08:48.300
'You're Rick Rake, right?'

08:48.366 --> 08:50.366
'Yeah, you're that SOB
on the radio'

08:50.433 --> 08:52.400
'who insults everybody
and their mother.'

09:02.100 --> 09:03.133
Aw.

09:10.766 --> 09:12.733
I can't believe you hit him!

09:12.800 --> 09:15.066
Oh, come on, he deserved it.

09:15.133 --> 09:18.200
He was making fun of us
in front of all those people.

09:18.266 --> 09:21.300
So? That's what you do
to people on the radio.

09:23.300 --> 09:24.900
Well, I didn't even mean
to hit the mime, okay?

09:24.966 --> 09:27.533
I meant to hit
that other guy!

09:27.600 --> 09:28.766
Since when were you
the kind of person

09:28.833 --> 09:31.833
who punches someone
in the middle of the street?

09:31.900 --> 09:33.833
I do what I have to do, okay?

09:35.266 --> 09:37.233
Well, so do I.

09:39.066 --> 09:42.600
Hey! What, what is this?

09:42.666 --> 09:44.800
The guy I married
was a sweet and gentleman

09:44.866 --> 09:46.866
who would walk away
from a fight.

09:46.933 --> 09:48.366
Oh!

09:48.433 --> 09:50.533
All this because
I punched a mime?

09:51.733 --> 09:53.666
It's been one thing
after another.

09:53.733 --> 09:56.133
That was just the straw
that broke the camel's back.

09:58.466 --> 10:00.800
'I feel like I don't know
you anymore, Rick.'

10:04.533 --> 10:06.600
And I don't sleep
with strangers.

10:07.800 --> 10:09.000
Oh, Sheila, wait..

10:09.066 --> 10:11.300
Would you just, uh..

10:32.266 --> 10:33.800
You again?

10:33.866 --> 10:35.333
What do you want?

10:37.533 --> 10:39.733
'I'm sorry...that I hit you.'

10:40.700 --> 10:42.633
It was an accident, okay?

10:45.366 --> 10:46.566
Well, alright,
you've had your apology.

10:46.633 --> 10:48.600
So why don't you get out?

10:50.000 --> 10:52.766
Move it!

10:52.833 --> 10:55.066
Look, I don't know
what your problem is, pal.

10:55.133 --> 10:57.300
But I think you just better
buzz off.

10:57.366 --> 10:59.533
Unless you wanna get
another fist in your face.

11:11.266 --> 11:12.700
I warned ya.

11:12.766 --> 11:14.800
Ow! God!

11:21.066 --> 11:22.133
Ow!

12:14.066 --> 12:15.866
Rick?

12:15.933 --> 12:18.466
I just found this
on the stoup.

12:18.533 --> 12:20.333
'Well, what do you mean?
You just found it?'

12:20.400 --> 12:21.966
Umm-hmm.

12:22.033 --> 12:23.800
Is the delivery guy
still here?

12:23.866 --> 12:25.233
No, I-I just found it.
You want me to open it?

12:25.300 --> 12:26.400
No!

12:44.233 --> 12:46.633
Smart-ass.

12:46.700 --> 12:48.766
- What is it?
- It's a doctor's bill.

12:48.833 --> 12:51.233
A 150 bucks for
a jaw X-ray?

12:53.933 --> 12:55.800
How could he find out
where we live?

12:55.866 --> 12:58.966
Are you gonna pay the bill?

12:59.033 --> 13:00.666
Oh, come on, Sheila,
you don't think I hit

13:00.733 --> 13:03.333
that guy on purpose, do ya

13:03.400 --> 13:04.666
It was an accident, okay?

13:04.733 --> 13:06.966
I did not mean
to hit the mime.

13:07.033 --> 13:08.700
I did mean to hit
that other guy.

13:08.766 --> 13:10.833
You shouldn't
have hit anyone.

13:13.600 --> 13:15.800
I know, you're right.
Okay.

13:15.866 --> 13:17.400
From now on you're
gonna see a brand new Rick

13:17.466 --> 13:18.833
Not only am I
gonna pay this bill

13:18.900 --> 13:20.133
but I'm gonna
find that mime tonight

13:20.200 --> 13:22.700
and I will apologize
to him in person.

13:23.800 --> 13:25.033
Okay?

13:25.100 --> 13:26.733
- Okay.
- Okay.

13:26.800 --> 13:28.300
Come here.

13:29.400 --> 13:30.433
Have a good day.

13:33.100 --> 13:35.033
This is Rick Rake.

13:36.833 --> 13:37.833
There's something important
I'd like to talk

13:37.900 --> 13:40.333
to you about today, folks.

13:40.400 --> 13:42.800
You know, we live
in a fast-paced..

13:43.966 --> 13:46.533
...hectic world,
you and me.

13:46.600 --> 13:49.033
And sometimes we let
the pressures of life

13:49.100 --> 13:50.933
you know..

13:51.000 --> 13:53.300
...the little problems
that we face we face every day..

13:54.933 --> 13:56.333
We let 'em get to us.

13:56.400 --> 13:58.900
And it makes us say
and do things that, uh..

14:00.333 --> 14:02.333
...well, we,
we shouldn't say and do.

14:04.366 --> 14:06.400
I guess what I'm trying
to say is that I..

14:10.066 --> 14:11.133
'Um..'

14:16.800 --> 14:20.533
I-I guess what I mean to say
is that, um..

14:20.600 --> 14:22.433
...we've got an even worse
problem on our streets

14:22.500 --> 14:24.800
ladies and gentlemen.

14:24.866 --> 14:26.533
I'm talking about those..

14:26.600 --> 14:28.433
...little twits
in black leotards

14:28.500 --> 14:30.333
who stand onourstree

14:30.400 --> 14:32.000
yours and mine..

14:32.066 --> 14:33.900
...hiding behind
their white make up

14:33.966 --> 14:37.000
and insulting upstanding
citizens like you and me!

14:37.066 --> 14:39.700
'I'm talking about those
little, silent slime balls'

14:39.766 --> 14:42.233
'who call themselves mimes.'

14:43.533 --> 14:44.933
Do you know what I think?

14:45.000 --> 14:46.600
I think there ought to be
a city ordinance

14:46.666 --> 14:48.600
prohibiting them from
performing on our streets!

14:48.666 --> 14:51.233
That's what I think,
and I challenge any mime

14:51.300 --> 14:53.133
who's out there today
listening in the audience

14:53.200 --> 14:54.500
to, uh, call in.

14:54.566 --> 14:57.366
Come on, call the station,
defend yourselves.

14:57.433 --> 14:59.533
Oops, I'm sorry.
You can't do that.

14:59.600 --> 15:00.833
Mimes don't talk.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.066
Well..

15:02.133 --> 15:05.633
Next selection we have
is for a certain mime.

15:05.700 --> 15:08.000
You know who you are.

15:08.066 --> 15:09.400
Here is Bells And Whistles

15:09.466 --> 15:12.366
with "Talking Dirty."

15:14.933 --> 15:16.866
You got a caller on line 3.

15:19.033 --> 15:20.166
Hello.

15:20.233 --> 15:23.166
- 'You rotten liar.'
- Sheila?

15:23.233 --> 15:25.233
I thought you were gonna
apologize to that mime.

15:25.300 --> 15:27.366
I am.

15:27.433 --> 15:29.200
Well, then why are you
insulting him now?

15:30.600 --> 15:32.066
Are you listening to the show?

15:32.133 --> 15:33.733
'You got it, buster.'

15:35.100 --> 15:37.133
I, um..

15:37.200 --> 15:38.966
I thought you said you didn't
listen to the show anymore.

15:39.033 --> 15:41.500
Well, I just happened
to turn it on this morning.

15:41.566 --> 15:43.933
'Just in time to hear you
being a real jerk.'

15:44.000 --> 15:46.800
Oh, well, look.
Just hold it a minute, okay?

15:46.866 --> 15:48.800
No, you hold on, Rick.

15:50.366 --> 15:52.000
Maybe you better take
a giant step back

15:52.066 --> 15:53.600
and look at yourself.

15:54.966 --> 15:56.666
Because you've let
your radio personality

15:56.733 --> 15:58.166
invade your real personality.

15:58.233 --> 16:00.833
And if you keep going this way..

16:00.900 --> 16:02.833
...you're gonna lose me.

16:02.900 --> 16:04.633
'Well, think about that, okay?'

16:11.600 --> 16:13.900
Hey, what's next, big guy?

16:15.133 --> 16:17.166
Just, uh..

16:17.233 --> 16:19.200
Just roll another one.
You pick it.

17:18.033 --> 17:19.733
What on Earth?

17:36.433 --> 17:38.133
Excuse me.

17:38.200 --> 17:39.733
Can I help you?

17:44.400 --> 17:47.566
Uh, my husband said he would
pay for your doctor bill.

17:47.633 --> 17:50.000
I-I hope you'll accept
my apology for what he did.

17:55.533 --> 17:56.933
This is crazy.

18:05.433 --> 18:07.266
'Earth to Rick.'

18:07.333 --> 18:10.700
'You have about ten seconds
before that song ends.'

18:11.466 --> 18:12.733
Uh..

18:12.800 --> 18:14.966
Uh, j-just play another one
without an intro, okay?

18:15.033 --> 18:17.733
What, are we a automated station
all of a sudden?

18:17.800 --> 18:19.133
Just do it!

18:35.500 --> 18:37.433
I just called Sheila
and she's not home.

18:38.033 --> 18:39.333
So?

18:39.400 --> 18:41.466
So I just talked to her
five minutes ago!

18:41.533 --> 18:44.966
Well, so? Maybe she just left
or went shopping or something.

18:45.033 --> 18:47.366
Uh, I-I, uh..
I got a bad feeling about this.

18:47.433 --> 18:49.433
Listen, put it on autopilot
for me, will ya?

18:50.733 --> 18:51.866
Yeah. Sure, boss.

19:02.066 --> 19:03.900
Oh, my God!

19:09.100 --> 19:10.333
'Sheila?'

19:11.300 --> 19:13.433
No!

19:31.066 --> 19:34.666
Yes, siree, that was
definitely a sinkhole.

19:34.733 --> 19:35.766
You know, there's some kinda

19:35.833 --> 19:38.266
geological formation
in the Springwood.

19:38.333 --> 19:41.400
I can't believe..

19:41.466 --> 19:43.000
...that no one
told you about the sinkholes

19:43.066 --> 19:45.800
before you bought the house!

19:45.866 --> 19:49.500
You know, you probably
can sue their butts off.

19:49.566 --> 19:51.633
By the way,
I got a brother-in-law

19:51.700 --> 19:52.966
who is an attorney, you know?

19:53.033 --> 19:54.533
I got his card
around here somewhere

19:54.600 --> 19:55.600
if you want to, uh--

19:55.666 --> 19:57.700
No, I don't need to see
a lawyer.

19:57.766 --> 20:00.433
Say what?

20:00.500 --> 20:02.433
I need to see a mime.

20:03.266 --> 20:05.266
Are you done with me?

20:05.333 --> 20:07.133
Y-yeah. Yeah, sure.

20:11.066 --> 20:13.133
Rick, you really don't hav
to finish out the day.

20:13.200 --> 20:15.766
No, I want to finish!

20:15.833 --> 20:16.966
I need to.

20:17.033 --> 20:20.033
Tracy, what's the next setup?

20:20.100 --> 20:22.033
Come on, come on, kid,
let's go. What the next setup?

20:24.366 --> 20:26.200
- Stone And The Stoners.
- Thank you.

20:36.733 --> 20:38.533
Hey, kids, Rick's back!

20:38.600 --> 20:40.400
I say what I think

20:40.466 --> 20:41.633
'and I think what I say.'

20:41.700 --> 20:44.366
And you know
what I think today, kiddies?

20:44.433 --> 20:45.666
I think I've just
found a solution to two

20:45.733 --> 20:46.833
of the world's biggest problems.

20:46.900 --> 20:48.300
Number one..

20:48.366 --> 20:50.733
...all those swell guys
up in Alaska who were

20:50.800 --> 20:53.233
clubbing baby seals
to death..

20:54.933 --> 20:57.166
...and number two..

20:57.233 --> 20:59.233
...those good-for-nothing mimes
infesting our streets.

20:59.300 --> 21:01.300
Do you know what I say?

21:01.366 --> 21:03.533
I say, we fly all these
seal-clubbing hunters

21:03.600 --> 21:04.866
up into the cities of America

21:04.933 --> 21:07.766
and let 'em have open season
on those pesky mimes!

21:07.833 --> 21:09.800
That's what&lt;T

21:11.800 --> 21:15.033
In fact, there's one mine
in particular..

21:15.100 --> 21:17.766
'...you know who you are..'

21:17.833 --> 21:20.233
...that I'd like
to take care of myself.

21:20.300 --> 21:22.400
So come on down
to the station, pal..

21:27.133 --> 21:28.700
...show you face.

21:30.566 --> 21:32.100
I dare you.

21:35.266 --> 21:36.400
In the meantime,
we have the latest

21:36.466 --> 21:38.800
from Stone And The Stoners.

21:50.666 --> 21:53.333
You son of a bitch!
You killed my wife!

22:06.300 --> 22:07.866
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

22:10.000 --> 22:11.800
You son of a bitch!

22:31.233 --> 22:33.666
I don't know how you did that.

22:33.733 --> 22:35.700
But you're gonna let me
outta here.

22:51.766 --> 22:53.066
Oh!

22:53.133 --> 22:55.433
What, what in the hell happened?

22:55.500 --> 22:58.233
- 'Oh, my God!'
- 'Call 9, call 911!'

22:58.300 --> 23:00.700
Ow! You're listening
to the Big Q.

23:00.766 --> 23:03.533
This is TracyTrash
talkin' at ya.

23:03.600 --> 23:06.000
And guess what,
it's almost time

23:06.066 --> 23:09.066
for Tracy's trashin'!

23:09.133 --> 23:12.366
But first let's have a little
talk with old Rick Rake

23:12.433 --> 23:14.200
and see how he's recovering.

23:14.266 --> 23:17.700
Rick, how're ya doin', big guy?

23:17.766 --> 23:19.533
Well, what's the matter?

23:19.600 --> 23:20.766
'Cat got your tongue?'

23:21.966 --> 23:24.466
'Oh, oh, oh,
I almost forgot.'

23:24.533 --> 23:28.133
'You can't talk anymore
after your accident!'

23:28.200 --> 23:30.033
Ooh, you really know

23:30.100 --> 23:32.233
how to cut your own throat,
career wise

23:32.300 --> 23:34.633
now, don't you, big guy?

23:34.700 --> 23:37.200
'Take a big stab
into the big time.'

23:37.266 --> 23:39.266
Ooh! That's too mean.

23:39.333 --> 23:42.533
Well, we will be right back
after a word from our sponsor.

23:47.200 --> 23:49.133
It's just part
of the act, big guy.

23:51.166 --> 23:54.633
She's even more cold-blooded
than you were.

23:54.700 --> 23:57.000
Oh, uh, this was left
for you in the lobby.

23:57.066 --> 23:59.233
It doesn't say
where's it's from.

24:30.833 --> 24:34.600
A mime is a terrible thing..

24:34.666 --> 24:35.833
...to waste!

24:35.900 --> 24:37.100
Mwah!

25:18.833 --> 25:20.933
Boy, am I hot!

25:22.366 --> 25:24.900
I'll fix
the air conditioning tomorrow.

25:24.966 --> 25:27.066
'That's not why I'm hot.'

25:27.133 --> 25:28.433
Oh, well, in that case

25:28.500 --> 25:30.900
maybe we should see if we can..

25:30.966 --> 25:33.000
...burn off a little heat.

25:43.466 --> 25:45.633
Oh, I love this birthmark.

25:45.700 --> 25:47.866
Looks like a beautiful jewel.

25:47.933 --> 25:49.933
Perhaps a diamond.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
You like it as much
as a real diamond?

25:52.066 --> 25:54.066
Hm, more.

25:54.133 --> 25:57.466
More than a three carat,
E-graded emerald

25:57.533 --> 26:00.400
mounted in a circle
of diamonds?

26:00.466 --> 26:03.033
Is that what I'm
after tonight?

26:03.100 --> 26:06.533
Only if you get your
little sexy butt moving.

26:06.600 --> 26:08.666
Oh, my dear,
you have a very unique way

26:08.733 --> 26:10.600
of ruining the moment.

26:10.666 --> 26:12.266
Don't worry,
the moment will continue

26:12.333 --> 26:15.233
when you get back.

26:15.300 --> 26:18.433
You can cool me off
with a bag of ice.

26:18.500 --> 26:20.300
Hot ice.

26:21.500 --> 26:24.200
That's my boy!

26:24.266 --> 26:26.733
Now, let's reveal.

26:26.800 --> 26:29.266
Tell me about your target.

26:29.333 --> 26:31.166
The names are Vivian
and Charles Endicott.

26:31.233 --> 26:34.966
They live at 2343,
Cherry Tree Lane.

26:35.033 --> 26:36.800
'Now, you're sure they keep
the good stuff in the house?'

26:36.866 --> 26:39.000
Have I been wrong yet?

26:39.066 --> 26:40.333
Not yet.

26:41.633 --> 26:43.500
Mother used to nag daddy
about how she wanted

26:43.566 --> 26:45.333
a wall safe
just like the Endicotts.

26:45.400 --> 26:48.266
So that's where
the jewelry will probably be.

26:48.333 --> 26:51.333
Unfortunately though, she never
said where the damn thing is.

26:51.400 --> 26:53.333
No problem, I'll find it.

26:54.500 --> 26:56.433
Are you sure you can open it?

26:58.100 --> 27:00.200
Have I ever failed?

27:00.266 --> 27:01.433
Not yet.

27:02.666 --> 27:04.100
Not ever.

27:29.033 --> 27:31.533
Who says crime doesn't pay?

27:33.000 --> 27:34.733
Look where it got me!

27:34.800 --> 27:37.433
Wait till you see
where it gets that guy.

29:43.266 --> 29:45.700
Candy for the lady?

29:45.766 --> 29:48.500
For me?

29:48.566 --> 29:50.433
If you like, or, uh..

29:50.500 --> 29:52.566
...you can choose another piece.

29:57.233 --> 29:58.800
Where's the pendant?

29:58.866 --> 30:01.533
Oh, yes.

30:01.600 --> 30:03.533
Thepiece de resistance.

30:43.066 --> 30:46.566
'This is Tracy Trash
with the news of the a.m.'

30:46.633 --> 30:48.200
'Ooh! Guess what?'

30:48.266 --> 30:50.833
'The daisy burglar
has struck again.'

30:50.900 --> 30:52.900
'Only this time,
with a new wrinkle.'

30:52.966 --> 30:56.266
'Seems this time he's not only
burglarized his victims'

30:56.333 --> 30:57.966
'but he has murdered them.'

30:58.033 --> 31:00.833
'Ooh, the daisy burglar's
usual yellow daisy

31:00.900 --> 31:02.633
'was found on the scene.'

31:02.700 --> 31:05.466
'Police don't know yet
who the daisy burglar is'

31:05.533 --> 31:07.766
'but they say,
now that murder is involved'

31:07.833 --> 31:09.800
'they will double
their task force.'

31:15.533 --> 31:18.300
You don't think
I killed those people?

31:18.366 --> 31:20.500
They were my parents' friends.

31:20.566 --> 31:22.633
Andi, you know I don't carry

31:22.700 --> 31:24.700
a gun on the job.

31:24.766 --> 31:26.600
And there's a very
good reason for it.

31:26.666 --> 31:28.400
The maximum sentence
in this state

31:28.466 --> 31:30.066
for burglary is five years.

31:30.133 --> 31:32.833
Do you know what it is
for murder?

31:32.900 --> 31:35.500
- Death?
- Exactly!

31:35.566 --> 31:38.200
Andi, you've got
to trust me on this.

31:38.266 --> 31:40.700
We've been together
a long time now.

31:40.766 --> 31:43.033
You know I couldn't kill
those people.

31:44.833 --> 31:47.766
Oh, God!
Kip.

31:47.833 --> 31:50.100
They think you killed
the Endicotts.

31:50.166 --> 31:52.866
No, they think the daisy burglar
killed them.

31:52.933 --> 31:56.400
And the only thing is they don't
know who the daisy burglar is.

31:56.466 --> 31:57.700
Yes, but what if
they figure it out?

31:57.766 --> 31:58.866
I mean, what if you
made a mistake

31:58.933 --> 32:00.066
this time,
left a clue or something?

32:00.133 --> 32:02.600
Look, they won't!
I didn't.

32:04.800 --> 32:06.733
I was very careful.

32:08.533 --> 32:10.500
What do we do now?

32:10.566 --> 32:13.300
Well, we go on living our lives
as we normally do.

32:14.366 --> 32:16.533
We change nothing.

32:16.600 --> 32:18.066
Do you understand that?

32:18.133 --> 32:19.300
Nothing.

32:39.500 --> 32:40.900
The stethoscope!

32:40.966 --> 32:42.800
What?

32:42.866 --> 32:44.466
What about the stethoscope?

32:44.533 --> 32:46.833
I left it at the house!
I have to go back.

33:02.400 --> 33:04.100
Looking for this?

33:04.166 --> 33:05.966
I guess it's true
what they say.

33:06.033 --> 33:09.000
A criminal always returns
to the scene of his crime.

33:09.066 --> 33:10.900
Surely you are aware
that the penalty

33:10.966 --> 33:13.300
for murder in this state
is death.

33:13.366 --> 33:15.133
But I-I, I didn't
murder anyone.

33:15.200 --> 33:16.833
That's what they all say.

33:16.900 --> 33:18.400
What's your neck size?

33:18.466 --> 33:20.900
Fifteen? Sixteen?

33:23.000 --> 33:25.200
Look, you gotta believe me.
I didn't kill anyone!

33:25.266 --> 33:28.000
This way you can't get off
on some technicality.

33:28.066 --> 33:30.533
But I didn't kill anyone!

33:30.600 --> 33:32.100
No!

33:33.100 --> 33:34.600
No!

34:10.400 --> 34:13.066
So where do you wanna go?

34:13.133 --> 34:14.300
What do you mean?

34:14.366 --> 34:18.266
Monte Carlo, Nice, Sydney?

34:18.333 --> 34:20.566
I thought the plan was
to live our lives as normal

34:20.633 --> 34:23.100
and not do anything unusual.

34:23.166 --> 34:25.433
Ah, yeah, well,
I changed my mind.

34:25.500 --> 34:28.700
I'm gonna unload the jewels,
use the money to buy tickets

34:28.766 --> 34:30.066
and then we're gonna
get out of the country

34:30.133 --> 34:32.133
as fast as we can.

34:32.200 --> 34:33.300
So think about
where you wanna go.

34:33.366 --> 34:35.333
I'll be back
before you know it.

35:05.100 --> 35:07.666
You did a very stupid thing.

35:07.733 --> 35:09.866
You-you heard?

35:09.933 --> 35:11.566
Heard?

35:11.633 --> 35:14.700
The cops have been here twice
already looking for the stuff.

35:14.766 --> 35:16.666
You're hot on fire, kid.

35:16.733 --> 35:18.433
Tom, I didn't kill
those people.

35:18.500 --> 35:20.133
I haven't even killed
anyone in my life!

35:20.200 --> 35:22.300
Hey, I didn't think
you did.

35:22.366 --> 35:24.233
Besides, there are a lot
of people who'd like to see

35:24.300 --> 35:25.500
Endicott dead, anyway.

35:25.566 --> 35:26.966
Like who?

35:27.033 --> 35:29.400
Well, let's just say
he does business

35:29.466 --> 35:32.000
with some very nasty people.

35:32.066 --> 35:34.600
So, um, what can I do you for?

35:53.033 --> 35:55.333
I thought you didn't do it.

35:55.400 --> 35:56.400
I said I didn't kill them.

35:56.466 --> 35:58.266
I didn't say
I didn't burglarize 'em.

35:58.333 --> 36:02.300
Well, so, uh...
what do you want me to do?

36:02.366 --> 36:03.400
Our normal deal.

36:03.466 --> 36:05.700
No, no, no, not this time.

36:05.766 --> 36:07.800
This stuff's hotter
than anything I ever handled.

36:07.866 --> 36:09.400
Tom, everything I've
brought you has been hot.

36:09.466 --> 36:11.000
It's never bothered
you before.

36:11.066 --> 36:14.033
Kip, don't you get
the picture, Kip?

36:14.100 --> 36:16.066
When there are dead bodies
lying around

36:16.133 --> 36:18.266
the cops double the heat!

36:18.333 --> 36:20.100
Get to the point.

36:22.166 --> 36:24.200
I'll give you half
our normal deal.

36:25.200 --> 36:26.433
No way.

36:31.666 --> 36:35.333
Have you ever heard any stories
about death row, Kipper?

36:35.400 --> 36:38.766
'I hear they got some very mean
guerrillas up there.'

36:38.833 --> 36:40.433
And they got nothing to lose..

36:40.500 --> 36:43.833
...'cause they're gonna
die, anyway.

36:43.900 --> 36:47.033
I hear they do some very sick
things to each other.

36:50.800 --> 36:53.800
Alright. You got a deal.

36:53.866 --> 36:56.566
But I'll be back in two hours,
and you better have the money.

36:56.633 --> 36:58.233
Drive careful.

37:04.033 --> 37:06.200
Andi, pack your bags
as we're..

37:15.966 --> 37:17.233
Damn!

37:27.433 --> 37:29.100
- Hello?
- 'Kip.'

37:29.166 --> 37:30.400
Andi, where are you?

37:30.466 --> 37:32.800
- 'I can't tell you that.'
- Why?

37:33.766 --> 37:35.333
Because...you'll find me

37:35.400 --> 37:37.700
and I don't feel safe
around you anymore.

37:37.766 --> 37:39.866
Andi, you got to believe me.
I-I couldn't have--

37:39.933 --> 37:41.600
Kip.

37:41.666 --> 37:43.900
I still love you.

37:43.966 --> 37:46.666
- Okay, well, then come home.
- No.

37:46.733 --> 37:49.333
No, I called because
I made a big mistake.

37:51.333 --> 37:52.533
I had to tell you.

37:53.433 --> 37:55.300
Tell me what?

37:57.800 --> 37:59.000
You called the police?

37:59.066 --> 38:01.933
'I was scared!
I didn't know what else to do.'

38:05.800 --> 38:06.800
Don't shoot!

38:06.866 --> 38:08.733
You're under arrest
for first-degree murder.

38:08.800 --> 38:10.266
But I didn't kill anyone,
I swear!

38:10.333 --> 38:11.800
You have the right
to remain silent.

38:11.866 --> 38:13.566
Anything you say
can and will be used

38:13.633 --> 38:14.733
'against you
in the court of law.'

38:14.800 --> 38:16.966
No, I didn't kill anyone!

38:17.033 --> 38:18.433
Yeah?

38:34.666 --> 38:36.033
God!

38:41.700 --> 38:43.600
What the..

39:23.000 --> 39:25.066
- Uh, Mrs. Chesterson?
- Yes.

39:25.133 --> 39:27.733
Uh, you-you don't know me.
I'm a friend of your daughter's.

39:27.800 --> 39:28.833
Oh, M-Marilyn?

39:28.900 --> 39:31.033
Uh, no, ma'am. Andi.

39:31.100 --> 39:33.533
Uh, I was wondering
is she here?

39:33.600 --> 39:36.133
Uh, is this your
idea of a joke?

39:36.200 --> 39:38.600
Joke? No, ma'am.
I need to know where she is.

39:38.666 --> 39:41.000
Andi died of cancer

39:41.066 --> 39:42.633
'two years ago.'

39:42.700 --> 39:45.500
What? Oh, that can't be,
I just..

39:47.533 --> 39:49.200
Do you mind telling me
what Andi looked like?

39:49.266 --> 39:51.700
If you don't go away,
I'll call the police.

39:54.666 --> 39:56.400
Just haven't got all the money,
that-that's all.

39:56.466 --> 39:57.400
It's been three hours!

39:57.466 --> 39:58.700
Hey, it's not easy to get

39:58.766 --> 40:01.033
that much money
without looking suspicious.

40:01.100 --> 40:03.366
You don't want me
to look suspicious, do you

40:03.433 --> 40:05.200
Tom, I need that money
to get out of the country.

40:05.266 --> 40:08.200
You'll get the money.
Just stay calm.

40:08.266 --> 40:10.200
Take a look at this.

40:11.533 --> 40:12.900
The cops were at your plac
and they found

40:12.966 --> 40:15.900
some of the stolen jewels
from every one of your jobs.

40:15.966 --> 40:17.800
They got these things
flying all over town.

40:17.866 --> 40:20.300
If they find you here,
they're gonna nail your ass.

40:20.366 --> 40:23.200
And you know what, mine to
for aiding and abetting.

40:26.166 --> 40:29.100
Tom, somebody's trying
to frame me.

40:29.166 --> 40:31.100
Why do you say that?

40:37.800 --> 40:40.333
Don't tell me.
The murder weapon.

40:41.733 --> 40:43.700
I found it in my pocket!

40:44.733 --> 40:46.133
I suppose it's not yours, huh?

40:46.200 --> 40:49.933
- I don't even own a gun!
- Alright. Alright!

40:50.000 --> 40:51.633
Tom, I gotta
get out of the country!

40:51.700 --> 40:54.333
Look, just sit down, will you?

40:54.400 --> 40:57.033
Try to stay calm. I'll go get
the rest of the money.

40:57.100 --> 40:59.000
You stay here.

40:59.066 --> 41:01.100
'Just stay out of sight!'

41:45.000 --> 41:46.933
Andi is their daughter.

41:48.466 --> 41:51.000
How did you figure that out?

41:51.066 --> 41:53.333
The little girl in the photo
from your parents' bedroom

41:53.400 --> 41:54.700
has a birthmark

41:54.766 --> 41:57.300
just like yours.

41:57.366 --> 41:59.800
Very observing of you.

41:59.866 --> 42:01.666
Maybe we should be introduced.

42:01.733 --> 42:03.166
My name's Claire Endecott.

42:03.233 --> 42:04.900
Such a stuffy name.

42:04.966 --> 42:07.033
I always liked my friend,
Andi's name better.

42:08.566 --> 42:11.066
All of the past year

42:11.133 --> 42:12.800
all that love..

42:12.866 --> 42:14.500
...all that passion..

42:14.566 --> 42:16.966
What? That was just an act?

42:17.033 --> 42:18.866
Not all of it.

42:18.933 --> 42:21.100
Actually it was kind of nice
while it lasted.

42:23.066 --> 42:25.033
And such a tragic end.

42:26.233 --> 42:28.466
What, what, what are you
talking about?

42:28.533 --> 42:31.100
Every good love story's
gotta have an end.

42:31.166 --> 42:32.800
Wait a second!

42:32.866 --> 42:35.600
Come on, after all we had!

42:35.666 --> 42:38.200
Well, some of them
must have been real.

42:38.266 --> 42:40.033
You can't just shoot me
in cold-blood!

42:40.100 --> 42:42.233
I'm sorry, Kip,
it's nothing personal.

42:42.300 --> 42:44.866
'It's just part of the plan.'

42:44.933 --> 42:46.400
Hey, Tom, Tom,
you're my friend

42:46.466 --> 42:47.833
you're not gonna let her
do this, are you?

42:49.766 --> 42:51.000
Well, Kipper..

42:51.066 --> 42:53.800
...the way I see it,
I've only got two choices.

42:53.866 --> 42:55.800
I could save your life..

42:55.866 --> 42:58.500
...and then I go to jail..

42:58.566 --> 42:59.866
...or I can spend
the rest of my life

42:59.933 --> 43:02.500
making love
to a beautiful woman..

43:02.566 --> 43:04.100
...and sharing the fortune
she inherits

43:04.166 --> 43:05.533
from her murdered parents.

43:07.466 --> 43:08.900
Tough choice, huh?

43:10.433 --> 43:11.700
I won't say anything, Andi.

43:11.766 --> 43:13.233
I'll, uh,
I'll leave the country.

43:13.300 --> 43:15.700
Come on, you'll-you'll inherit
everything still.

43:15.766 --> 43:17.266
Hm.

43:17.333 --> 43:18.733
No.

43:18.800 --> 43:21.833
I don't think so.
I'm sorry, Kip.

43:22.800 --> 43:23.733
No!

43:29.400 --> 43:32.166
Here they come, right on time
just as planned.

43:32.233 --> 43:34.066
So we have
our story straight, right?

43:34.133 --> 43:35.300
Yep.

43:35.366 --> 43:37.100
He took me hostage..

43:37.166 --> 43:40.200
...then he dragged me down here
to get the money from you.

43:40.266 --> 43:43.700
'When you wouldn't give it
to him, he shot you.'

43:43.766 --> 43:46.833
Then I wrestled
the gun away from him..

43:46.900 --> 43:48.833
...and I shot him
in self-defense.

43:48.900 --> 43:51.000
Hey-hey, wh-what?
Whoa-oh, wait.

43:51.066 --> 43:53.200
Back up one step.

43:53.266 --> 43:55.866
Wh-what do you mean
he shot me?

43:55.933 --> 43:58.500
That's not part
of the plan.

43:58.566 --> 44:00.100
Yes, it is.

44:10.566 --> 44:13.700
Well, that's my kind of woman.

44:13.766 --> 44:15.200
She kills her parents

44:15.266 --> 44:18.000
kills her boyfriend,
kills her partner.

44:20.333 --> 44:21.933
If she kills me..

44:22.000 --> 44:23.466
...what a babe. Yeah.

44:23.533 --> 44:24.833
Rich, too.

44:24.900 --> 44:27.000
My daddy used to always say..

44:27.066 --> 44:28.066
"Marry Money."

44:31.033 --> 44:33.566
Almost makes me
wish, uh..

44:33.633 --> 44:35.333
...I was still alive.
