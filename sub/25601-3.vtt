PEDRO: Her name is Soledad.
I brought her,

00:20.954 --> 00:22.156
'cause
we're gonna get married.

00:22.190 --> 00:23.724
And I want to run
what we created.

00:23.757 --> 00:26.427
I want to be
part of the family.

00:26.460 --> 00:29.430
Well, you have to provide me
with absolutely pure cocaine

00:29.463 --> 00:31.399
at prices that's
gonna make your balls hurt.

00:31.432 --> 00:32.600
Who the fuck are you, man?

00:32.633 --> 00:33.867
Doesn't matter who I am.

00:33.901 --> 00:35.736
It only matters
who I represent.

00:35.769 --> 00:36.904
And who's that?

00:36.937 --> 00:39.073
The United States Government.

00:39.107 --> 00:41.175
Shit, 5,000 ain't shit.

00:41.209 --> 00:43.244
FRANKLIN:
It is. It's a lot.

00:43.277 --> 00:45.346
I don't want those two
knowing what I'm holding.

I told you not to mention
that fucking money!

Lucia Villanueva.

00:54.822 --> 00:56.590
Tell your boss
we can help each other out.

00:56.624 --> 00:59.059
Hey, what you looking for?
We got what you need, man.

00:59.093 --> 01:00.861
Wait!
(screams)

01:00.894 --> 01:01.929
Back the fuck up!

We've lost the buyer.

01:05.633 --> 01:07.368
And I'm out of my supply.

01:07.401 --> 01:08.569
What,
you're gonna take Avi's place?

01:08.602 --> 01:10.037
I'd like to try.

01:10.070 --> 01:11.305
You know, I'm starting
to realize

01:11.339 --> 01:13.073
that you got one job
in this life,

01:13.107 --> 01:15.143
and that's to protect
the people you love.

01:15.176 --> 01:16.310
Get in here.

01:16.344 --> 01:18.112
Oh my God!

01:18.146 --> 01:19.247
-Oh, shit!
-Franklin!

FRANKLIN:
I thought maybe I should go,

02:24.545 --> 02:26.914
before your pop shoots me
for some burglar.

02:33.153 --> 02:35.323
That's Jerome's idea
of being careful.

02:37.891 --> 02:39.793
So...

02:39.827 --> 02:41.995
You just in danger
walking down the street now?

02:42.029 --> 02:44.164
Well, I carry
a lot cash sometimes.

02:48.336 --> 02:50.070
(somber music)

02:50.103 --> 02:51.672
Hey.

02:51.705 --> 02:57.245
*

02:57.278 --> 02:58.712
How long we got?

03:00.414 --> 03:02.216
An hour or two.

03:02.250 --> 03:04.151
But if you hear something
that sound like the front door,

03:04.184 --> 03:05.819
you best get your ass
out here fast.

03:05.853 --> 03:08.389

TEDDY:
I hated that dog.

03:57.271 --> 03:59.106
-I hated that dog!
MATT: Hated!

03:59.139 --> 04:01.309
And I'm just like, what did
the dog do to you, man?

04:01.342 --> 04:02.810
MATT:
That's a canine!

04:02.843 --> 04:06.246
Every time you came home
at night with dad's car

04:06.280 --> 04:08.416
-after getting all...
-That was with...

04:08.449 --> 04:10.217
both: Margolis!

04:10.250 --> 04:11.619
Oh, man.

04:11.652 --> 04:13.253
And he's standing there,
4:00 in the morning,

04:13.287 --> 04:14.322
-he's standing there--
-You're out here trying

04:14.355 --> 04:15.923
to explain to him, you're like,

04:15.956 --> 04:18.959
about health class and
hormones, and all kids gotta--

04:18.992 --> 04:21.295
He's scared to death!
"It's all all right, man."

04:21.329 --> 04:23.564
both:
"It's all all right, man."

04:23.597 --> 04:24.598
(laughs)

04:24.632 --> 04:26.334

04:26.367 --> 04:28.902
I got eyes on the LZ.

04:28.936 --> 04:30.771
*

04:30.804 --> 04:33.741
All right, so yeah, this
is gonna be real professional.

04:33.774 --> 04:36.444
It should just be two or three
low-level Colombian guys.

04:36.477 --> 04:38.312
They probably
won't even speak English.

04:38.346 --> 04:40.614
Just open the doors,
stand aside,

04:40.648 --> 04:42.316
and let them load up the--

04:42.350 --> 04:44.452
You told me 15 times already,
tell me once more,

04:44.485 --> 04:46.186
I'm gonna crash this plane
into the desert.

04:46.219 --> 04:47.955
All right, well,
it's not a joke, though.

04:47.988 --> 04:49.990
We get in,
we get out, right?

04:50.023 --> 04:51.592
That's affirmative.

04:51.625 --> 04:53.661
Thank you.

Yeah.

05:38.906 --> 05:41.341
Real professional,
like a couple of Green Berets

05:41.375 --> 05:43.276
dropping in on a VC picnic.

05:45.012 --> 05:46.013
Hola.

05:49.617 --> 05:50.618
Hola.

05:52.420 --> 05:53.421
(speaking Spanish)

06:09.637 --> 06:12.606
You will wait
for Danilo and Diego.

06:12.640 --> 06:14.675
No, that's what I'm saying,
we don't have time for that.

06:14.708 --> 06:16.243
We're gonna miss the window
for our drop.

06:16.276 --> 06:18.579
Mm.

06:18.612 --> 06:20.313
Search them.

06:25.986 --> 06:27.054

all right, all right.

06:35.062 --> 06:36.396
Look, we do this every week.

06:36.430 --> 06:38.131
No, you did.

06:39.433 --> 06:41.368
All right, you know what?
I want my cocaine

06:41.401 --> 06:43.236
on that plane right now,
you understand me?

06:45.005 --> 06:46.039
(shouts)

06:51.178 --> 06:52.480
I'm sorry, do you not know

06:52.513 --> 06:53.614
-who we are?
-(speaking Spanish)

06:53.647 --> 06:55.115
*

06:55.148 --> 06:57.250
The bosses only need
one of you alive to talk.

06:57.284 --> 07:00.220
*

07:00.253 --> 07:03.457
Mm... I'm supposed
to be back by morning.

07:03.491 --> 07:05.559
Or at least call Jerome.

07:05.593 --> 07:07.795

is over.

-Mm-mm.
-Seriously.

07:19.607 --> 07:21.742
So... Ooh!

07:21.775 --> 07:23.644
Come on!

07:23.677 --> 07:26.013
Mm-hmm.

07:26.046 --> 07:27.748
I'm gonna take you out
for breakfast.

07:27.781 --> 07:29.282
Mm-hmm.

07:29.316 --> 07:30.851
And then bring you back.

07:30.884 --> 07:32.119
Mm-hmm.

07:32.152 --> 07:34.988
And make you pass out again.

(moans)

07:36.890 --> 07:38.526
(groans)

07:38.559 --> 07:40.260

07:44.498 --> 07:46.967

what this is about, do you?

07:47.000 --> 07:48.135
*

07:48.168 --> 07:49.970
What do you mean?

07:50.003 --> 07:54.808
*

07:54.842 --> 07:55.876
Don't go anywhere.

07:55.909 --> 07:57.678
Where you going?

07:57.711 --> 08:04.718
*

08:11.692 --> 08:13.026
Open it.

08:13.060 --> 08:20.067

08:28.008 --> 08:30.410

Like a gypsy.
Cheap motels and trailer parks.

10:20.654 --> 10:22.155
And the girl?

10:22.189 --> 10:23.623
Soledad Caro.

10:23.657 --> 10:26.126
Both parents dead,
no brothers or sisters.

10:26.159 --> 10:28.762
She went to Galveston Community
College for a year,

10:28.796 --> 10:31.431
and she was tending bar
at some shithole in El Paso

10:31.464 --> 10:33.300
called El Hueco
when they met.

10:33.333 --> 10:35.703
-You checked that out?
-Owner confirmed it.

10:35.736 --> 10:37.604
Said she pretty much
ran the place for him.

10:37.637 --> 10:38.839
(snorts)

10:38.872 --> 10:42.109
A monkey could run a dive bar.

10:42.142 --> 10:43.476
A trained monkey.

10:45.245 --> 10:48.348
I guess I really only have
one other question for you.

10:48.381 --> 10:50.383
How the hell did you miss this?

10:50.417 --> 10:51.885
-What?
-Pedro!

10:51.919 --> 10:53.787
You said it was
like he'd vanished.

10:53.821 --> 10:55.723
He was smart,
he used only cash,

10:55.756 --> 10:57.357
had fake IDs,
moved around a lot.

10:57.390 --> 10:59.626

It's good to have you back.

11:13.073 --> 11:16.009
-Lucia.
-(speaking Spanish)

11:16.043 --> 11:18.178
I didn't know
you were coming by today.

11:18.211 --> 11:20.313
We talked about a job.

11:20.347 --> 11:21.849
Which I said I'd think about.

11:21.882 --> 11:23.316
And have you?

11:23.350 --> 11:25.052
What's the hurry?

11:25.085 --> 11:26.586
You just got back.

11:26.619 --> 11:28.255
Take her to Knotts Berry Farm.

11:28.288 --> 11:29.689
We'll talk next week.

11:29.723 --> 11:30.991
I want to work.

11:31.024 --> 11:33.026
Yeah,
and I've wasted enough time.

11:33.060 --> 11:35.729
The family business is as much
mine as it is yours, Lucia.

11:37.130 --> 11:39.166
Now...

11:39.199 --> 11:41.835
What do you have for us?

11:41.869 --> 11:44.772
(romantic music playing)

11:44.805 --> 11:46.706
Mm-mm, baby,
you're supposed to be on guard.

11:46.740 --> 11:48.742
How are you gonna stop
a burglar if I'm on top of you?

11:48.776 --> 11:50.277
-Was that Louie?
-Uh-uh, Jerome,

11:50.310 --> 11:51.578
she ain't here.

11:51.611 --> 11:53.013
Hey, what's she
doing here, Lee?

11:53.046 --> 11:54.281
You supposed to be
on guard, man.

11:54.314 --> 11:56.349
Hey, my nigga,
she keeping me up.

11:56.383 --> 11:57.450
Where the hell you been?

11:57.484 --> 11:58.886
Over at Claudia's.

11:58.919 --> 12:00.687
Between the VSOP
and the tongue-lashin',

12:00.720 --> 12:03.857
I passed out, but I got here
as soon as I could.

12:03.891 --> 12:06.293
For all I know,
you could be in trouble, right?

12:06.326 --> 12:07.694
Uh-huh.

12:07.727 --> 12:08.695
Lot of people
want what we got.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.363
What you and Franklin got.

12:10.397 --> 12:13.100
All I got is burnt fingers
and hair that smell like shit.

12:13.133 --> 12:14.101
(screams)

12:14.134 --> 12:15.936
Goddamnit, Jerome!

12:15.969 --> 12:17.805
Why you got these niggas
all over my house?

12:17.838 --> 12:19.039
We ain't running
no goddamn motel.

12:19.072 --> 12:20.607
(chuckles)

-Hey, hold up--
-Delroy and them got killed!

12:22.109 --> 12:23.376
-They cut off their dicks, man!
-Huh?

12:23.410 --> 12:25.145
They cut
off their dicks, man!

12:25.178 --> 12:26.479
-Mexicans! They cut off they--
-Who you talking about?

12:26.513 --> 12:27.948
Delroy
and my little cousin, man!

12:27.981 --> 12:29.649
They cut their dicks off,
you're sure?

12:29.682 --> 12:31.084
Yeah, nigga, I'm sure.
Why you just standing here?

12:31.118 --> 12:32.119
Get the heat,
we gotta ride on them!

12:32.152 --> 12:33.620
Guns for what?

12:33.653 --> 12:35.055
What you think?

12:35.088 --> 12:36.489
Kill us some
motherfucking Mexicans!

motherfucking dead!

12:47.100 --> 12:49.069
Motherfucking knives
and shit, man.

12:49.102 --> 12:50.838
I don't know
where the fuck Franklin at.

12:50.871 --> 12:52.672
He said he was going over to
his mama's house,

12:52.705 --> 12:54.007
-probably at Melody's.
-You sure they cut their dicks

12:54.041 --> 12:55.809
off, my nigga?
You see that shit?

12:55.843 --> 12:56.977
Mookie did. He said he saw
the bodies with the coroner

12:57.010 --> 12:58.611
over there by El Big Burrito.

12:58.645 --> 12:59.813
-At Wabash and Stone?
-Hold on! That's goddamn

12:59.847 --> 13:01.414
Pico-Union, nigga!

13:01.448 --> 13:03.650
I told you to stop fucking
with them goddamn Mexicans

13:03.683 --> 13:05.685
and the skinny fucking
motherfuckers!

13:05.718 --> 13:07.254
I know, but I can't lose you
right now.

13:07.287 --> 13:08.621
Mookie called Delroy's mom.

13:08.655 --> 13:10.123
Delroy's mama
called Leon's mama.

13:10.157 --> 13:11.591
Leon's mama tried to page him,

13:11.624 --> 13:14.027
he wasn't answering,
so she called my mama.

13:14.061 --> 13:16.029
Delroy and his mama
used to live with me.

13:16.063 --> 13:17.965
He more like my little
brother than my cousin.

13:17.998 --> 13:19.466
-And now, we gotta get 'em.
-We will get 'em.

13:19.499 --> 13:21.268
Now we gotta kill 'em!

13:21.301 --> 13:22.870
Hold on! Mookie called
Latisha, Latisha called Gloria,

13:22.903 --> 13:24.371
Gloria told you,
and you just gonna what?

13:24.404 --> 13:26.139
Go out in the street
and just shoot anybody?

13:26.173 --> 13:27.841
-It don't make no sense!
-We'll kill all the fucking

13:27.875 --> 13:29.442
esés, fuck 'em!

13:29.476 --> 13:30.810
Delroy's dead.

13:30.844 --> 13:33.446
Vic is dead.
They castrated them!

13:33.480 --> 13:35.048
-They castrate 'em!
-They lynched 'em!

13:35.082 --> 13:37.117
They cas--
They done lynched the nigga!

13:37.150 --> 13:38.651
-Okay--
-Come on, Lee!

13:38.685 --> 13:40.854
(overlapping shouting)

13:40.888 --> 13:42.722
Nobody here seen a body!

13:42.755 --> 13:44.024
And even if they are dead,

13:44.057 --> 13:45.458
-we need to make a plan--
-Louie!

13:45.492 --> 13:47.794
Get back to your
goddamn girlfriend!

13:47.827 --> 13:49.629
-Okay--
-This is man shit!

13:49.662 --> 13:51.164
Just find Franklin first!

13:51.198 --> 13:52.966
Fuck Franklin!

13:53.000 --> 13:55.368
Fine! I'll find him!

13:55.402 --> 13:56.970
Do you need me
to do something?

13:57.004 --> 13:59.306
No, baby, this is man shit!

13:59.339 --> 14:02.209
All right, at least just
let us load up the plane,

14:02.242 --> 14:03.843
and then we'll wait
for your bosses,

14:03.877 --> 14:05.879
if that's what you want.

14:05.913 --> 14:07.347
Do you understand
that we represent

14:07.380 --> 14:09.082
the American Government?

14:09.116 --> 14:11.851
*

14:11.885 --> 14:13.420
America.

14:13.453 --> 14:15.055
Mm.

14:15.088 --> 14:18.225
United States
is a pichiruchi country

14:18.258 --> 14:21.528
who can't win a war without the
rest of the world behind it.

14:21.561 --> 14:23.363
*

14:23.396 --> 14:25.765
You murdered the Indians,

14:25.798 --> 14:28.268
you chained the blacks,

14:28.301 --> 14:31.204
and you pissed on the vatos.

14:31.238 --> 14:33.606
I spit on America.

14:33.640 --> 14:36.109
*

14:36.143 --> 14:38.411
And your country?

14:38.445 --> 14:41.214
It's nothing.

14:41.248 --> 14:42.950
It is weak.

14:42.983 --> 14:44.417
It is inconsequential.

14:44.451 --> 14:46.719
You are like a pawn
that we sacrifice.

14:46.753 --> 14:48.688
You play chess, or...

14:48.721 --> 14:51.791
Nah, you're probably more
of a checkers kind of guy.

14:51.824 --> 14:55.128
(chuckles)

14:55.162 --> 14:58.131
-Hey!
-(speaking Spanish)

14:58.165 --> 15:01.101
(shouting in Spanish)

15:01.134 --> 15:02.569
Wait! No! Don't shoot!

15:02.602 --> 15:04.571
(whistles)

15:04.604 --> 15:11.611
*

15:14.314 --> 15:16.316
Hello, Reed.

15:22.489 --> 15:25.492
(children laughing)

15:30.330 --> 15:32.265
This isn't
what I had in mind.

15:32.299 --> 15:34.434
You wanted back in,

15:34.467 --> 15:36.469
(speaking Spanish)

15:38.671 --> 15:41.641
(snoring)

15:41.674 --> 15:42.675
(knocks on door)

15:43.810 --> 15:45.178
Gustavo.

16:28.221 --> 16:29.589
-Okay.
-(snorts)

16:45.272 --> 16:47.274
(scoffs)

17:01.188 --> 17:02.189
Mm?

17:04.424 --> 17:06.093
(clicks tongue)

17:06.126 --> 17:08.128
Mm?

17:12.132 --> 17:15.535
(blows landing)

17:17.370 --> 17:20.340
(tense music)

17:20.373 --> 17:26.012
*

17:26.045 --> 17:28.448
Maybe we should
go somewhere else.

17:28.481 --> 17:29.849
Why? This is where
the shit happened.

17:29.882 --> 17:31.084
Where the esés at?

17:31.118 --> 17:32.619
JEROME:
They're probably asleep.

17:32.652 --> 17:34.854
Shit, first time
I've been outside the house

17:34.887 --> 17:36.356
before noon in a goddamn year.

17:36.389 --> 17:37.757
Look, we just gotta
pick somebody,

17:37.790 --> 17:39.058
-don't really matter who.
-Oh, hell no.

17:39.092 --> 17:40.193
That shit ain't right.

17:40.227 --> 17:41.528
KEVIN:
It ain't right?

17:41.561 --> 17:42.595
No, what ain't right
is them killing

17:42.629 --> 17:43.630
our motherfucking people

17:43.663 --> 17:45.098
like animals.

17:45.132 --> 17:46.633
We gotta send a message, right?

17:46.666 --> 17:47.734
By killing
a bunch of old folks

17:47.767 --> 17:49.236
and fucking kids, my nigga?

17:49.269 --> 17:50.537
We can't let these
motherfucking wetbacks

17:50.570 --> 17:51.571
kill our people,
then walk around

17:51.604 --> 17:52.572
like ain't shit happened.

17:52.605 --> 17:54.407
*

17:54.441 --> 17:56.209
Oh, y'all too soft.

17:56.243 --> 17:57.910
So I'm gonna have to
do this shit myself.

17:57.944 --> 17:59.312
-Let me out of the car, man.
-No, my nigga.

17:59.346 --> 18:01.148
(overlapping shouts)

18:01.181 --> 18:02.749
You ain't killing no
fucking kids, my nigga!

18:02.782 --> 18:03.916
(pounding)

18:03.950 --> 18:07.254
You dumb motherfuckers.

18:07.287 --> 18:08.755
Wrap this shit up.

18:08.788 --> 18:10.490
We out of here.

18:10.523 --> 18:14.394
*

18:14.427 --> 18:17.430
(distant siren)

18:26.139 --> 18:27.674
What the fuck
is wrong with you people?

18:27.707 --> 18:28.975
You just gonna go out in
the street, start shooting

18:29.008 --> 18:30.310
'cause you got a phone call?

18:30.343 --> 18:31.678
Not just
a fucking phone call.

18:31.711 --> 18:33.280
Mookie seen it, man,
they really dead.

18:33.313 --> 18:35.081
So you gonna go and kill
the first Mexican you see?

18:35.114 --> 18:36.416
That's what you do, man!
Ain't your daddy a Panther?

18:36.449 --> 18:37.784
They hit you,
you hit them back!

18:37.817 --> 18:39.352
You just out here
with your M-16

18:39.386 --> 18:40.953
backing this shit up?
You the one who warned me

18:40.987 --> 18:42.455
'bout the motherfuckers
in the first place!

18:42.489 --> 18:44.257
They killed one
of our goddamn folks,

18:44.291 --> 18:45.958
-all right? I overreacted!
-That's still just hearsay,

18:45.992 --> 18:47.093
-you don't just go out there--
-No, it wasn't, man,

18:47.126 --> 18:48.995
Mookie seen--

18:49.028 --> 18:50.330
-What is you doing?
-Come on.

18:52.499 --> 18:53.766
What's wrong with y'all?

18:53.800 --> 18:55.635
We already lost two people,

18:55.668 --> 18:57.370
and now you put
three more in jeopardy

18:57.404 --> 18:58.505
and you know what?

18:58.538 --> 18:59.806
I don't even know why the fuck

18:59.839 --> 19:01.674
any of this shit even happened!

19:01.708 --> 19:03.376
Delroy and Victor was out
there pitching on Pico-Union.

19:03.410 --> 19:04.844
I thought we told them
to stay out of there.

19:04.877 --> 19:06.379
I know we told them
to stay out of there

19:06.413 --> 19:07.847
-but I can't make--
-That's the fucking job!

19:07.880 --> 19:10.417
That's the fucking job, man!

19:11.984 --> 19:13.786
When we tell somebody
to do some shit,

19:13.820 --> 19:15.322
we supposed
to make sure they do it.

19:15.355 --> 19:16.956
It was in the same place

19:16.989 --> 19:18.491
where that Mexican bitch
gave you the phone number.

19:20.760 --> 19:22.329
You mean to tell me
you knew somebody

19:22.362 --> 19:24.464
who might've helped you?

19:24.497 --> 19:25.998
Might've told you
what really happened,

19:26.032 --> 19:27.500
you didn't think
to call her first

19:27.534 --> 19:29.569
before going
down there fully loaded?

19:29.602 --> 19:31.170
Nephew, I gave you the card

19:31.204 --> 19:32.705
with the goddamn number on it.

19:43.716 --> 19:45.318
LUCIA:
How's it going?

19:45.352 --> 19:47.053
(speaking Spanish)

19:47.086 --> 19:49.722
Sometimes one looks good,
but it's rotten at the core.

19:49.756 --> 19:51.558
Sometimes it's hard to tell.

19:51.591 --> 19:54.427
Pedro made it sound like this
whole place was just for show.

19:54.461 --> 19:56.896
No, our farms in Mexico
are where we started.

19:56.929 --> 19:58.030
They're our heartbeat,

19:58.064 --> 20:00.199
our identity.

20:00.233 --> 20:01.668
SOLEDAD:
And you don't want any

20:01.701 --> 20:03.403
rotten onions in the basket.

20:05.372 --> 20:08.074
For a farmer's daughter,
old habits die hard.

20:08.808 --> 20:11.711
Mira, Lucia, I think

20:11.744 --> 20:13.112
that you will come to feel

20:13.145 --> 20:15.515
that you and I
are not so different.

20:15.548 --> 20:17.016
How's that?

20:17.049 --> 20:18.885
We are both survivors.

20:18.918 --> 20:21.053
(Latin music)

20:21.087 --> 20:22.622
(chuckles)

20:22.655 --> 20:24.023
(speaking Spanish)

20:24.056 --> 20:25.458
Tiger Fuentes?

20:25.492 --> 20:26.859
-Gigi.
-(chuckles)

20:26.893 --> 20:27.894
LUCIA:
She is a handful.

20:27.927 --> 20:29.262
(speaking Spanish)

20:29.296 --> 20:30.263
I'm fine, really.

20:30.297 --> 20:33.300
(phone ringing)

20:35.635 --> 20:36.969
Bueno?

20:37.003 --> 20:38.538
FRANKLIN:
I want to talk to the woman

20:38.571 --> 20:41.308
who sent me her phone number
a couple days ago

20:41.341 --> 20:43.242
from down the Pico-Union.

20:43.276 --> 20:45.612
(ominous music)

20:45.645 --> 20:46.979
Yeah, I wanted to talk to you

20:47.013 --> 20:48.415
about a possible business deal.

20:48.448 --> 20:51.250
*

20:51.284 --> 20:54.321
Yeah,
I don't know about all that.

20:54.354 --> 20:55.988
The reason I'm calling
is to find out

20:56.022 --> 20:59.091
why my men were killed
yesterday.

20:59.125 --> 21:00.927
FRANKLIN:
Murdered and mutilated.

21:00.960 --> 21:03.262
They're dead?

21:03.296 --> 21:05.965
*

21:05.998 --> 21:06.966
Are you sure?

21:06.999 --> 21:08.601
Lady, what the fuck?

21:08.635 --> 21:10.303
(music intensifies)

21:10.337 --> 21:12.405
Two of men are dead,
you're asking am I sure?

21:12.439 --> 21:13.840
I didn't know.

21:13.873 --> 21:15.107
I hadn't heard.

21:15.141 --> 21:16.576
Who are you?

21:16.609 --> 21:19.946
Lucia Villanueva.

21:19.979 --> 21:22.649
You know who
killed my people, Lucia?

21:22.682 --> 21:25.284
LUCIA:
I have no idea.

21:25.318 --> 21:27.654
Let me look into it,
and then maybe we can meet.

21:27.687 --> 21:29.255
Say 2:00?

21:29.288 --> 21:30.857
*

21:30.890 --> 21:32.792
Not in no Pico-Union.

21:32.825 --> 21:34.861
*

21:34.894 --> 21:37.129
What about that park
near Gower?

21:37.163 --> 21:40.500
It's public
and not Mexican or black.

21:40.533 --> 21:41.501
2:00.

21:41.534 --> 21:43.803
*

21:43.836 --> 21:45.972
Do me a favor.

21:46.005 --> 21:48.375
Only bring one of your people.

21:48.408 --> 21:50.176
Will you only
bring one of yours?

21:50.209 --> 21:52.311
Me and mine
ain't killed none of yours.

21:52.345 --> 21:55.382
*

21:55.415 --> 21:56.516
I'll see you at 2:00 then.

21:56.549 --> 21:58.985
*

22:03.856 --> 22:05.157
Have the pigs' feet.

22:05.191 --> 22:07.159
They call it
Spanish pigs' feet.

22:07.193 --> 22:09.862
But it is a delicacy
of our culture.

22:09.896 --> 22:11.964
We came here in good faith.

22:11.998 --> 22:14.333
DANILO: The pigs' feet
is a national dish,

22:14.367 --> 22:18.538
but aguardiente
is what we drink.

22:18.571 --> 22:21.340
It is related to
the Mexican tequila and mescal,

22:21.374 --> 22:24.010
but it is a superior, uh...

22:24.043 --> 22:25.378
What do you call it?

22:25.412 --> 22:27.313
-Spirit.
-You're wasting our time.

22:27.346 --> 22:28.848
We're gonna miss the window
for our drop.

22:28.881 --> 22:30.383
I thought you guys
were professionals,

22:30.417 --> 22:32.218
not amateurs.

22:32.251 --> 22:33.420
Amateurs?

22:33.453 --> 22:35.087
You're the amateurs.

22:35.121 --> 22:36.689
DIEGO:
It is an amateur

22:36.723 --> 22:39.058
who allows his own man
to steal his plane

22:39.091 --> 22:40.593
and his cocaine.

22:40.627 --> 22:42.194
An amateur
who misses a week of product.

22:42.228 --> 22:43.663
An amateur who arrives

22:43.696 --> 22:45.264
with a gringo
we've never seen before

22:45.297 --> 22:47.500
and expects us to trust him.

22:47.534 --> 22:50.236
I came here especially
to reassure you

22:50.269 --> 22:51.938
and to introduce you
to my new pilot.

22:51.971 --> 22:53.873
Instead, I have been beaten,
I have been insulted--

22:53.906 --> 22:56.409
You mouthed off.

22:56.443 --> 22:57.877
You called our country...

22:57.910 --> 23:00.112
(speaking Spanish)

23:00.146 --> 23:02.615
(speaking Spanish)

23:02.649 --> 23:04.250
Who do you think you are?

23:04.283 --> 23:05.985
Talking about
our country like that.

23:08.254 --> 23:10.289
You're right,
he shouldn't have done that.

23:10.322 --> 23:12.859
But your man,
he insulted our country.

23:12.892 --> 23:14.727
-So what?
-Your country is shit.

23:14.761 --> 23:17.096
-Less than shit.
-Okay.

23:17.129 --> 23:19.566
But my man
doesn't see it that way.

23:19.599 --> 23:21.568
He loves his country.

23:21.601 --> 23:22.802
Your man upset him.

23:22.835 --> 23:24.403
That is no excuse.

23:24.437 --> 23:26.573
You shit on our people.

23:26.606 --> 23:28.641
Look...

23:28.675 --> 23:30.076
He's sorry.

23:30.109 --> 23:33.279
I'm sorry.
We're both sorry.

23:33.312 --> 23:34.914
But if you don't
get us on our way,

23:34.947 --> 23:36.549
we're gonna miss our drop,

23:36.583 --> 23:38.818
and that's gonna cause
mucho problems.

23:40.987 --> 23:42.421
I like this guy.

23:42.455 --> 23:44.223
Maybe you should screw him,
marica.

23:44.256 --> 23:46.593
Maybe I will,
(speaking Spanish).

23:47.426 --> 23:49.128
If we let you go now,

23:49.161 --> 23:50.930
you'll take twice
the weight on this trip.

23:50.963 --> 23:52.499
To make up for what
you missed last week.

23:52.532 --> 23:54.000
MATT: We didn't bring
enough money for that.

23:54.033 --> 23:55.434
But we'd be happy
to take the weight,

23:55.468 --> 23:56.769
make up
the difference next time.

23:56.803 --> 23:58.204
There are also
some other things.

23:59.105 --> 24:00.673
Some gifts that we need.

24:00.707 --> 24:02.775
Two cases of Tony the Tiger
Frosted Flakes.

24:02.809 --> 24:05.778
29 copies of Michael Jackson's
album Thriller.

24:05.812 --> 24:07.313
A case of sheepskin condoms.

24:07.346 --> 24:09.582
15 Cabbage Patch Dolls
for Christmas

24:09.616 --> 24:11.150
and those fancy
Christmas lights.

24:11.183 --> 24:12.819
Lots and lots
of those fancy lights.

24:12.852 --> 24:15.454
And visas for my friend
and I and our families.

24:15.488 --> 24:17.490
And also, one bodyguard

24:17.524 --> 24:19.191
who will bring his mother
and young daughter.

24:19.225 --> 24:21.093
-No visas.
-Yes, visas.

24:21.127 --> 24:22.629
We want to take our wives
to Disneyland.

24:22.662 --> 24:24.296
And our girlfriends
to Las Vegas.

24:24.330 --> 24:26.098
Paul Anka is playing
at the Flamingo next week.

24:26.132 --> 24:28.100
-Paul Anka?
-All right, thank you, no.

24:28.134 --> 24:29.936
You're talking about
official government documents.

24:29.969 --> 24:32.505
I thought
you were the government.

24:32.539 --> 24:34.040
DIEGO:
Isn't that what you told us?

24:34.073 --> 24:35.207
That's what he told us.

24:35.241 --> 24:36.375
Unless you're a fucking liar.

24:36.408 --> 24:38.010
We'll take care of the visas.

24:38.044 --> 24:39.378
It's no problem.

24:41.413 --> 24:42.882
Now I like him.

24:42.915 --> 24:44.383
Maybe you should screw him.

24:44.416 --> 24:47.386
("At the Party"

punch, munch, crunch,

25:27.960 --> 25:29.929

(music fades)

25:39.972 --> 25:41.974
El Oso.

25:42.742 --> 25:45.211
What the hell
are you doing here?

25:45.244 --> 25:47.880
I'm the man
you're looking for.

25:47.914 --> 25:49.916
Can we talk in private?

26:06.132 --> 26:09.135
(geese honking)

26:09.902 --> 26:11.570
Jerome tells me
they killed your uncle

26:11.604 --> 26:13.372
a few months ago.

26:13.405 --> 26:15.441
Sorry to hear that.

26:15.474 --> 26:17.509
My father died
around the same time.

26:18.477 --> 26:19.946
Nothing to do about it.

26:19.979 --> 26:21.881
-People die.
-Yeah.

26:21.914 --> 26:24.116
Sometimes
it don't make no sense.

26:26.285 --> 26:28.721
Victor and Delroy were wrong.

26:28.755 --> 26:29.756
But to kill them for standing

26:29.789 --> 26:32.291
on a street corner was foul.

26:32.324 --> 26:34.627
Yes it was.

26:34.661 --> 26:36.929
My people want
this murder avenged.

26:38.631 --> 26:40.099
A fucking mutilation?

26:40.132 --> 26:42.134
Your friends were killed.

26:42.168 --> 26:44.637
But there was no mutilation.

26:44.671 --> 26:46.673
I know that doesn't
make things any better,

26:46.706 --> 26:48.908
but there's
an even bigger problem.

26:48.941 --> 26:51.243
The man who did this
is not just some street thug.

26:51.277 --> 26:52.611
You know his name?

26:52.645 --> 26:55.147
Yeah.

26:55.181 --> 26:56.683
But he's protected.

26:56.716 --> 26:57.950
By who?

26:57.984 --> 27:00.787
Everyone.

27:00.820 --> 27:03.022
The man who killed your people,

27:03.055 --> 27:06.025
if he were touched
by you or any of your men,

27:06.058 --> 27:08.260
you'd have an entire
army of vatos

27:08.294 --> 27:10.697
after you
and everyone you know.

27:10.730 --> 27:12.464
(ominous music)

27:12.498 --> 27:15.301
Why are you here?

27:15.334 --> 27:17.704
Because I know about
the drug you've been selling.

27:17.737 --> 27:20.206
The hard cocaine.

27:20.239 --> 27:22.374
I may be able
to help you sell a lot more.

27:22.408 --> 27:23.876
Two of my men are dead,

27:23.910 --> 27:25.477
and you're here to talk
about business?

27:25.511 --> 27:27.680
Your men were doing business.

27:27.714 --> 27:30.482
The man
who killed them was too.

27:30.516 --> 27:32.184
Everything we do
is about business.

27:32.218 --> 27:33.853
How do I tell my people

27:33.886 --> 27:35.654
that they working
with the enemy?

27:35.688 --> 27:38.357
I'm not the enemy.

27:38.390 --> 27:40.126
And you are not a puppet.

27:40.159 --> 27:47.166
*

27:48.034 --> 27:50.036
No promises.

27:51.437 --> 27:54.340
What kind of business
are we talking about?

27:57.543 --> 27:59.345
Hey, what up, Oso?

27:59.378 --> 28:00.880
You still wrestling and shit?

28:00.913 --> 28:02.915
Man, don't talk to him;
he's with them!

28:02.949 --> 28:09.021
*

28:09.055 --> 28:11.390
Okay, that's fine,
but my people are still

28:11.423 --> 28:13.359
gonna want to do something
about our dead men.

28:13.392 --> 28:17.897
*

28:17.930 --> 28:19.866
I'll try to broker a deal

28:19.899 --> 28:21.734
that will make us both happy.

28:21.768 --> 28:28.775
*

28:32.411 --> 28:33.412
Take care.

28:37.449 --> 28:39.518
-Hey, where they going?
-Home.

28:39.551 --> 28:41.053
She told you who did it?

28:41.087 --> 28:43.055
She gonna ask around.

28:43.089 --> 28:44.690
Ask around? Man, all these
spics know each other, man.

28:44.723 --> 28:46.926
You gotta make her tell you
who killed Delroy.

28:46.959 --> 28:48.627
She can't tell us
what she don't know.

28:48.660 --> 28:50.362
-Bullshit she don't know.
-She wasn't there, Kev.

28:50.396 --> 28:51.730
She gonna find us a number,

28:51.764 --> 28:52.765
and then we gotta do
something about it,

28:52.799 --> 28:54.633
but we gotta wait on that!

28:54.666 --> 28:56.435
Fuck that! These Mexicans
killed our people, your people,

28:56.468 --> 28:58.037
-and you just tuck tail and run!
-I'm tired of listening

28:58.070 --> 28:59.571
-to this shit, Kev!
-Shit ain't right, man!

28:59.605 --> 29:01.607
I always knew you wasn't
built for this shit, son.

29:01.640 --> 29:08.647
*

29:16.088 --> 29:18.590
(sobs)

29:18.624 --> 29:20.392
Fuck that shit, man.

29:20.426 --> 29:22.995
I love y'all.

29:23.029 --> 29:25.464
Hey, come on, man!
Come back.

29:25.497 --> 29:26.966
JEROME: Hey!

29:26.999 --> 29:31.003
*

29:36.508 --> 29:39.511
(engine roaring)

29:48.154 --> 29:50.689
So where exactly
are you planning

29:50.722 --> 29:52.191
on getting these visas?

29:52.224 --> 29:53.692
I don't know why
you're so pissed off.

29:53.725 --> 29:55.127
I'm the one who got us
out of there.

29:55.161 --> 29:56.963
Well, yeah,
by making promises

29:56.996 --> 29:58.297
that I'm gonna have to keep.

29:58.330 --> 30:00.432
Better that
than a bullet to the head.

30:00.466 --> 30:02.935
Second, who says
you have to keep them?

30:02.969 --> 30:04.703
Oh, oh, oh!
(stammering)

30:04.736 --> 30:07.373
You think it's a good idea
to be making empty promises

30:07.406 --> 30:09.275
to crazy Colombian
drug dealers?

30:09.308 --> 30:11.944
Yes, they are
crazy Colombian drug dealers.

30:11.978 --> 30:14.013
Who gives a shit
what you promise them?

30:14.046 --> 30:15.814
Jesus Christ.

30:15.848 --> 30:19.118
Look, from now on, just leave
the negotiating to me, okay?

30:19.151 --> 30:21.453
No. Not when
what you're saying has them

30:21.487 --> 30:23.055
pointing a gun at my head.

30:23.089 --> 30:25.524
You came to me, remember?

30:25.557 --> 30:27.393
-You needed my help?
-No, I need you to fly

30:27.426 --> 30:29.328
the plane, Matt,
to fly the load!

30:29.361 --> 30:30.963
Apparently that's not all!

30:30.997 --> 30:32.231
I was in 'Nam!

30:32.264 --> 30:34.400
There were no good guys.

30:34.433 --> 30:37.336
And the only way
to deal with bad guys

30:37.369 --> 30:39.038
is to be worse.

30:39.071 --> 30:41.540
So do us both a favor, take
that stick out of your ass

30:41.573 --> 30:43.675
and start pretending like
you got a ten-inch cock to go

30:43.709 --> 30:46.545
along with a terminal case
of the "I-Don't-Give-a-Fucks."

30:46.578 --> 30:50.917
And start pretending like
you are a goddamn drug dealer

30:50.950 --> 30:53.185
before you get us both killed.

30:54.253 --> 30:55.487
You done?

30:55.521 --> 30:57.356
If you hear me.

30:57.389 --> 30:58.424
I hear you.

31:00.392 --> 31:02.394
-Then I'm done.
-Great.

31:03.695 --> 31:07.533
(wind howling)

31:07.566 --> 31:09.568
Drop site in ten minutes.

31:10.369 --> 31:11.737
Clip into that harness,

31:11.770 --> 31:13.339
I would hate
for this to be the thing

31:13.372 --> 31:15.574
that got you killed today.

31:18.978 --> 31:20.812
You know I fucking
love you, right?

31:22.781 --> 31:24.783
I'm glad you're here.

31:26.285 --> 31:28.520
It's a thrill and
a privilege, Teddy.

31:28.554 --> 31:31.090
It is a thrill and a privilege.

31:31.123 --> 31:33.425
(funky music)

31:33.459 --> 31:35.361
I just can't go
to that cookhouse today.

31:35.394 --> 31:37.029
I just can't.

31:37.063 --> 31:39.298
Y'all niggas running around
with guns and shit.

31:39.331 --> 31:41.300
And then expect me
to wash your dishes

31:41.333 --> 31:43.202
and cook your rock.
Uh-uh. Just no.

31:43.235 --> 31:45.237
Shit, Wanda could cook.

31:45.271 --> 31:47.139
Yeah, we hear her cooking
on your rock every night.

31:47.173 --> 31:48.274
(laughs)

31:48.307 --> 31:50.309
You don't hear the half of it.

31:57.816 --> 31:58.884
Hey, baby.

31:58.917 --> 32:00.987
Auntie.

32:01.020 --> 32:02.955
Jerome get you them studs?

32:02.989 --> 32:04.823
Jerome? (laughs)

32:04.856 --> 32:07.726
Jerome wouldn't know a diamond
if it bit him on the ass.

32:07.759 --> 32:10.729
(soul music playing)

32:10.762 --> 32:17.769
*

32:20.772 --> 32:23.275
Product coming in soon.

32:23.309 --> 32:25.277
That's why I need you
in the cookhouse, Louie.

32:28.347 --> 32:30.349
I need your car, Unc.

32:35.787 --> 32:37.856
You bring
the shit back in one piece?

32:41.193 --> 32:43.195
Leon, you're with me.

32:44.496 --> 32:46.498
That's good.

32:51.903 --> 32:53.972
FRANKLIN: You talk to Kev?

32:54.006 --> 32:55.841
LEON: He with his family
and Delroy's mama.

32:55.874 --> 32:58.044
He blame himself
for putting his boy to work.

32:58.077 --> 33:00.546
I'm gone one day,
people start dying.

33:00.579 --> 33:02.648
Kev going crazy.

33:02.681 --> 33:04.183
I mean, I know
him and Delroy were close,

33:04.216 --> 33:06.352
but we told them fools
"Stay out of Pico-Union."

33:07.519 --> 33:09.955
What Kev want? Huh?

33:09.988 --> 33:12.858
Start a war,
get us all killed?

33:14.326 --> 33:16.162
You did
the right thing, Saint.

33:16.195 --> 33:18.197
I mean, Kev
was way out of line.

33:18.230 --> 33:19.631
But you know, he didn't
grow up without no daddy,

33:19.665 --> 33:20.832
so he don't know nothing
about no rules.

33:20.866 --> 33:22.368
Neither did you.

33:22.401 --> 33:24.703
But you learned somehow.

33:26.438 --> 33:28.474
Look, tomorrow we got
that big shipment coming.

33:28.507 --> 33:30.642
So I'm gonna need you
to work the cookhouse

33:30.676 --> 33:33.379
so we can catch up, huh?

33:33.412 --> 33:35.514
I got you.

33:41.720 --> 33:44.156
Hey, one more thing.

33:44.190 --> 33:46.092
I was wrong to get in that car.

33:46.125 --> 33:48.760
We all was.

33:48.794 --> 33:50.696
Next time, I'll wait for you.

33:55.067 --> 33:58.036
(suspenseful music)

33:58.070 --> 34:03.909
*

34:03.942 --> 34:06.545
You dropped twice
the load we agreed on.

34:06.578 --> 34:08.414
I know.

34:08.447 --> 34:10.616
But that's just the way it's
gonna have to be from now on.

34:10.649 --> 34:12.784
But it means
that you double your take, so.

34:12.818 --> 34:15.087
It was a pleasure
to meet you, senorita.

34:15.121 --> 34:16.522
-You too.
-All right.

34:16.555 --> 34:22.228
*

34:24.430 --> 34:25.697
We have to teach our people

34:25.731 --> 34:27.266
how to break up
the hard cocaine.

34:27.299 --> 34:28.634
Franklin says each rock

34:28.667 --> 34:30.136
will be about
the size of a pool ball.

34:30.169 --> 34:32.238
We break them down
to a 1/10 of a gram each.

34:32.271 --> 34:33.939
You think we can
trust (inaudible) to move it

34:33.972 --> 34:35.441
after what Conejo did?

34:35.474 --> 34:37.209
Hopefully they do
what Gabriela says.

34:37.243 --> 34:39.411
I'll talk to Hernan.

34:39.445 --> 34:41.780
He'll organize the women
to break the drug down.

34:41.813 --> 34:44.416
*

34:44.450 --> 34:46.218
LUCIA:
What do we do about Conejo?

34:46.252 --> 34:48.354
Guys like that
are bad for business.

34:52.358 --> 34:54.493
stay out of his way.

34:54.526 --> 34:56.728
Men like that
are in this for glory.

34:56.762 --> 34:58.330
Their sons can't eat glory.

34:58.364 --> 35:00.266
They need their fathers
to teach them how to be men.

35:00.299 --> 35:02.601
To teach them how
to be fathers, not killers.

35:02.634 --> 35:05.237
Yeah, but...

35:05.271 --> 35:08.106
Truth only helps
if a man accepts it.

35:08.140 --> 35:10.209
*

35:13.612 --> 35:14.613
(scoffs)

35:17.449 --> 35:20.118
It was like
going around with a child.

35:20.152 --> 35:22.321
Maybe he'll
get bored and quit.

35:30.896 --> 35:33.832
Why let Pedro back in...

35:33.865 --> 35:34.866
LUCIA: That's not true.

35:39.070 --> 35:41.039
He's my family, Oso.

35:41.072 --> 35:42.408
I don't have much family left.

35:47.746 --> 35:50.015
(birds chirping)

36:07.366 --> 36:08.900
I thought we were
supposed to meet at 6:00.

36:08.934 --> 36:11.370
Yeah.

36:11.403 --> 36:13.405
You always show up
an hour early?

36:13.439 --> 36:15.574
Just something I do.
Never wondered why.

36:18.744 --> 36:21.313
It's 'cause you're smart

36:21.347 --> 36:23.048
and careful.
Those are qualities

36:23.081 --> 36:25.751
that'll serve us both well,
I think.

36:25.784 --> 36:27.553
I thought we said ten keys,
ten a pop.

36:27.586 --> 36:30.922
Yeah, that's the money.

36:30.956 --> 36:33.525
My customers
don't pay in large bills.

36:35.227 --> 36:37.729
You ever hear of a bank?

36:37.763 --> 36:39.331
You know what happens
when a black man

36:39.365 --> 36:41.633
walks into a bank
with dirty fives and tens?

36:43.602 --> 36:45.704
Maybe you're
using the wrong bank.

36:45.737 --> 36:47.939
Maybe you show me
the right one.

36:47.973 --> 36:49.107
If I do that,
maybe you could start

36:49.140 --> 36:50.609
taking more than ten
keys a week?

36:50.642 --> 36:52.544
Let's do a couple deals
with ten first.

36:52.578 --> 36:54.780
Then maybe we could talk
doing some more.

36:54.813 --> 36:56.715
Sure.

36:59.050 --> 37:01.753
Business is only as good
as the people you work with.

37:01.787 --> 37:03.188
You mean you work with people

37:03.221 --> 37:04.790
who tase, interrogate,
and drug you?

37:04.823 --> 37:06.825
And people
who have you followed.

37:10.496 --> 37:13.465
(dramatic hip-hop music)

37:13.499 --> 37:20.506
*

37:21.973 --> 37:24.142
LOUIE: And this gonna be
coming in every week now?

37:24.175 --> 37:25.711
-Mm-hmm.
-We're gonna need a stove

37:25.744 --> 37:27.313
-in every room.
-And more fucking cookers.

37:27.346 --> 37:29.548
FRANKLIN:
Stoves, yeah.

37:29.581 --> 37:32.083
I want to be careful
about who know the recipe.

37:32.117 --> 37:34.920
So for now,
we keep the cooking in family.

37:34.953 --> 37:36.488
Even if we
get this all rocked up,

37:36.522 --> 37:38.290
we ain't got enough soldiers
to move it.

37:38.324 --> 37:39.925
There ain't enough smokers
in LA for all this shit.

37:39.958 --> 37:42.594
All y'all gotta do is cook it
up and break it down.

37:42.628 --> 37:44.563
I'll figure out how to move it.

37:44.596 --> 37:47.299
*

37:47.333 --> 37:49.401
All right, man.

37:49.435 --> 37:52.070
*

37:52.103 --> 37:54.340
ROB: Hey, man.
Hey.

37:56.342 --> 37:59.445
With Avi gone,
the Valley's pretty dry.

37:59.478 --> 38:01.179
You cool with me
taking a kilo of powder,

38:01.212 --> 38:02.648
seeing if I can move it?

38:02.681 --> 38:04.450
*

38:04.483 --> 38:06.318
You know somebody
hook it up?

38:06.352 --> 38:09.455
Yeah, I've got a couple guys
who could be good for it.

38:09.488 --> 38:12.290
All right, man, all you.

38:12.324 --> 38:14.259
As long as
I'm fronting this shit,

38:14.292 --> 38:17.329
we split it 60/40.

38:17.363 --> 38:19.865
Okay, that's good by me.

38:19.898 --> 38:21.367
both: Rad.

38:21.400 --> 38:22.834
*

38:38.584 --> 38:39.818
(siren wailing in distance)

38:39.851 --> 38:41.219
(knocks)

38:41.252 --> 38:44.222
(ominous music)

38:44.255 --> 38:51.262
*

39:02.040 --> 39:04.543
-Hey.
-Hi.

39:05.911 --> 39:07.646
Can I come in?

39:07.679 --> 39:09.748
Yeah, come on.

39:12.551 --> 39:14.820
Louie and Jerome here?

39:14.853 --> 39:17.222
Nah, we alone.

39:18.524 --> 39:20.526
You look nice.

39:32.203 --> 39:34.706
What?

39:34.740 --> 39:36.007
Was it really Jerome

39:36.041 --> 39:37.943
that made you carry
around that gun?

39:39.778 --> 39:42.448
We're just
being careful, Mel.

39:42.481 --> 39:45.484
So you ain't never
used a gun on anyone?

39:46.485 --> 39:48.487
Never.

39:49.455 --> 39:51.457
Good.

40:03.569 --> 40:05.871
(laughs)

40:05.904 --> 40:08.339
(knocking on door)

40:11.810 --> 40:13.812
(knocking continues)

40:15.346 --> 40:18.016
(knocking grows louder)

40:26.124 --> 40:28.827
(knocking intensifies)

40:34.132 --> 40:35.567
Mr. Wright.

40:35.601 --> 40:37.803
Officer Wright.

40:41.206 --> 40:43.509
How can I help you, Officer?

40:45.477 --> 40:46.912
You see that Toyota,

40:46.945 --> 40:48.013
parked down the block?

40:48.046 --> 40:49.615
(ominous music)

40:49.648 --> 40:50.916
FRANKLIN:
What about it?

40:50.949 --> 40:52.518
It belongs
to a missing person

40:52.551 --> 40:54.820
named Malcolm Jenkins.

40:54.853 --> 40:56.588
Went by "Biscuit."

40:56.622 --> 40:58.624
*

40:58.657 --> 41:00.626
He worked for a bail bondsman
that you recently hired.

41:00.659 --> 41:02.961
*

41:02.994 --> 41:05.096
So?

41:05.130 --> 41:06.297
Is that all you gotta say?

41:06.331 --> 41:08.867
Nothing else to say.

41:08.900 --> 41:10.435
WRIGHT:
You want to explain the car?

41:10.468 --> 41:12.871
FRANKLIN:
Maybe it broke down.

41:12.904 --> 41:14.540
Maybe his friend
picked him up,

41:14.573 --> 41:16.608
maybe he took the bus.

41:16.642 --> 41:18.610
Maybe somebody
stole the motherfucker

41:18.644 --> 41:20.278
and left it there,
I don't know.

41:20.311 --> 41:21.680
Bullshit.

41:21.713 --> 41:23.048
I don't know
what you want from me, man.

41:23.081 --> 41:25.483
I'm just in my crib,
watching TV.

41:25.517 --> 41:28.554
See, you think you're smarter
than everybody else.

41:28.587 --> 41:31.523
But you're not.

41:31.557 --> 41:33.024
You see, I'm gonna make sure

41:33.058 --> 41:34.826
that the truth surfaces
with this shit.

41:34.860 --> 41:36.494
Until then,

41:36.528 --> 41:38.997
stay the fuck
away from me and mine.

41:39.030 --> 41:41.066
*

41:41.099 --> 41:43.068
You understand?

41:43.101 --> 41:47.305
*

41:47.338 --> 41:49.207
That all?

41:55.246 --> 42:02.253
*

42:16.735 --> 42:23.742
*

42:41.559 --> 42:48.566
*

42:55.974 --> 42:58.376
FRANKLIN:
Where are the bodies?

42:58.409 --> 43:00.545
PEACHES:
Gone.

43:00.578 --> 43:02.147
*

43:02.180 --> 43:06.885
FRANKLIN: You didn't think
to check if they had a car?

43:06.918 --> 43:10.488
I knew it was there when I
felt the keys in his pocket.

43:10.521 --> 43:13.725
What am I supposed to do
about that? Steal it?

43:13.759 --> 43:16.594
Get my fingerprints
all over it?

43:16.628 --> 43:18.730
Them men dead and gone.

43:18.764 --> 43:21.299
They won't be the last.

43:21.332 --> 43:23.568
Just do your job, Saint.

43:23.601 --> 43:26.004
I'll do mine.

43:26.037 --> 43:33.011
*

(tense music)

43:48.326 --> 43:51.296
(radio chatter)

43:51.329 --> 43:53.598
Okay, move out.

43:53.631 --> 43:57.468
Clear 'em out!

43:57.502 --> 43:58.837
Let's go.

43:58.870 --> 44:00.271
*

44:00.305 --> 44:03.041
Move!

44:03.074 --> 44:05.711
Let's go, let's go!

44:05.744 --> 44:07.713
Get them all out of here now.

44:07.746 --> 44:12.617
*

44:12.650 --> 44:14.452
I ain't moving!
I ain't going!
