(door opens)

00:28.428 --> 00:31.030
Creating rainbow nail polish
is cool, but...

00:32.365 --> 00:36.001
uh, is this
a school-sanctioned
experiment?

00:36.036 --> 00:38.403
Let's just say it won't be
on the final exam.

00:38.438 --> 00:40.105
Jane, can you get me
the emulsifier?

00:41.408 --> 00:43.275
Huh. They're gone.

00:43.310 --> 00:45.110
And so are
the coagulants.

00:45.145 --> 00:47.446
Uh, check the drawers maybe?

00:47.481 --> 00:49.114
They've appeared to
have wandered away.

00:49.149 --> 00:51.116
Curiouser and curiouser.

00:51.151 --> 00:53.885
I don't get it.
Everyone in Auradon
is so good.

00:53.920 --> 00:54.920
Who would do this?

00:54.955 --> 00:56.455
I'll tell you who!

00:56.490 --> 00:58.557
The same person
who spray painted my room!

01:00.393 --> 01:02.527
Oh, snap.
That's harsh.

01:02.562 --> 01:05.097
Yeah, I was about to use
the same words.

01:05.132 --> 01:07.466
Snap, harsh, absolutely.

01:07.501 --> 01:09.401
And who do we know
who has a history

01:09.436 --> 01:10.735
of defacing property
with spray paint?

01:10.770 --> 01:12.270
A history of breaking the rules?

01:12.305 --> 01:13.772
A history of evil?

01:15.242 --> 01:17.476
Oh, and (chuckles)
don't forget,

01:17.511 --> 01:19.377
a history
of using magic.

01:19.412 --> 01:21.746
"Double, double,
toil and trouble.

01:21.781 --> 01:24.450
"Cauldron burst
with brilliant bubbles."

01:25.519 --> 01:27.652
Weird, that's not
supposed to happen.

01:27.687 --> 01:29.321
-Huh?
-Ally: Oh, delightful!

01:29.356 --> 01:32.357
-Aw!
-Pretty!
Oh, look at them all!

01:33.460 --> 01:34.960
(gasps)

01:34.995 --> 01:36.328
-What the bippity?
-(bubbles pop rapidly)

01:36.363 --> 01:37.562
-Oh--
-Oh, no!

01:37.597 --> 01:38.630
Oh, my gosh!

01:38.665 --> 01:41.133
-(all screaming)
-Terrific. Mal, what'd you do?

01:42.169 --> 01:44.102
-Do not move!
-Look out!

01:44.137 --> 01:46.104
-Help!
-Watch out for it!

01:46.139 --> 01:48.740
It's only a dream.
It's only a dream...

01:48.775 --> 01:50.642
-(Ally whimpers)
-Oh! Whoa!

01:50.677 --> 01:55.247
Can't... believe...
I'm fighting... bubbles!

01:55.282 --> 01:58.183
(all exclaiming)

01:58.218 --> 01:59.851
Audrey:
Oh! Look what you did!

01:59.886 --> 02:02.020
Our clothes are ruined!

02:02.055 --> 02:03.788
I love this dress.

02:03.823 --> 02:05.757
Mal, how could you?

02:05.792 --> 02:09.261
Oh, but those outfits,
that's the new style.

02:09.296 --> 02:10.795
You look totally hot,

02:10.830 --> 02:12.330
and hot is the new cool.

02:12.365 --> 02:14.199
Hot is the new cool?

02:15.335 --> 02:17.469
Actually, yeah,
I have heard that.

02:17.504 --> 02:18.503
They are pretty fetch.

02:18.538 --> 02:20.772
-Hm. I can make this work.
-I love this.

02:20.807 --> 02:22.374
We totally look fab.

02:22.409 --> 02:23.842
Now back to the experiment.

02:23.877 --> 02:25.477
-Oh, yay!
-Jane: What should
we do first?

02:25.512 --> 02:27.212
-Mal, what's going on with...
-(door closes)

02:27.247 --> 02:28.480
...you?

02:29.482 --> 02:31.149
Something is wrong

02:31.184 --> 02:33.051
and it's only getting worse.
