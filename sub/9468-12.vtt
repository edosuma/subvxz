01:18.459 --> 01:20.129
Fuck.

02:01.712 --> 02:04.132
Ah... fuck.

02:19.562 --> 02:22.150
Ah!

02:22.191 --> 02:24.693
Come on, come on, come on.

02:24.735 --> 02:26.402
Agh!

03:31.258 --> 03:33.221
Hey, Tom.

03:33.262 --> 03:36.473
The latest one, was it...
was it Christina?

03:36.514 --> 03:38.765
Deputies found some
torn clothing and a ID

03:38.807 --> 03:40.769
for a Jennifer Fredericks
at the site.

03:40.811 --> 03:44.104
- Jenny Fredericks?
- You know her?

03:44.146 --> 03:46.692
No, no. Shelley does.

03:50.694 --> 03:54.116
She's the only real friend
she ever had.

03:54.157 --> 03:56.616
That means Christina's
still out there.

04:02.500 --> 04:06.002
You wanna say something to me,
or you just gonna eye fuck me?

04:10.674 --> 04:15.012
Tom, I know that you feel
right now more than ever

04:15.054 --> 04:18.098
that you have a job to do, but
with everything that's happen--

04:18.139 --> 04:20.435
I'm not one of your patients,
Doctor.

04:20.475 --> 04:22.310
As a friend.

04:22.353 --> 04:24.521
Maybe you should go home
for a little while.

04:24.564 --> 04:26.732
I'll go home
when Christina's safe

04:26.774 --> 04:30.151
and Peter Rumancek is dead
and in the ground.

04:45.293 --> 04:46.961
Come on.

04:50.879 --> 04:54.009
When I was a young girl,
there was a game I used to play

04:54.050 --> 04:56.095
with my cousins--

04:56.137 --> 04:59.723
wicked little beasts
of the first rank.

04:59.764 --> 05:03.060
Game was called
wolves in the wood.

05:03.100 --> 05:05.353
"Play with" perhaps
misstates it,

05:05.396 --> 05:10.067
implying my consent
as part of the proceedings.

05:10.108 --> 05:13.862
At any rate,
after the moon had risen,

05:13.903 --> 05:16.615
they would spirit me out
to the forest,

05:16.656 --> 05:20.035
an enchanted place
in the fuller sense of the word,

05:20.076 --> 05:22.079
filled with mysteries

05:22.120 --> 05:25.706
and nameless dangers
prowling in the dark.

05:25.749 --> 05:27.668
They would...

05:27.709 --> 05:31.588
lay me on a bed of moss. I can

05:31.629 --> 05:35.675
feel it on the back of my neck
to this day.

05:35.716 --> 05:39.262
I was to lay perfectly still

05:39.305 --> 05:43.559
as they circled
through the trees on tiptoes,

05:43.600 --> 05:47.937
growling deep in their throats

05:47.980 --> 05:50.899
and warning me
there were wolves on the hunt

05:50.939 --> 05:53.610
with a taste for little girls.

05:53.653 --> 05:59.533
The slightest movement
on my part would give me away.

05:59.574 --> 06:03.204
I'd be gobbled up in a blink.

06:06.331 --> 06:10.709
Mm, of course I was terrified
for life and limb.

06:10.752 --> 06:13.963
Did my utmost
to escape this monstrous fate.

06:16.466 --> 06:18.427
But...

06:18.468 --> 06:23.641
the harder I concentrated
on not betraying myself,

06:23.682 --> 06:27.353
the more impossible it became
not to smile.

06:27.394 --> 06:30.146
A great cry would then go up:
"You moved, you moved!"

06:30.189 --> 06:35.944
and with yips and howls
they would descend on me,

06:35.985 --> 06:39.947
cover my body head to toe

06:39.990 --> 06:41.992
with kisses.

08:06.242 --> 08:09.370
Christina. Hey.

08:09.413 --> 08:11.665
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to scare you.

08:11.706 --> 08:13.250
That's all right, sweetheart.

08:13.290 --> 08:15.461
Are you OK?

08:15.502 --> 08:18.088
Is your dad home?

08:18.129 --> 08:20.507
No. Uh, do you want me
to call him?

08:20.548 --> 08:22.259
No, no.

08:22.300 --> 08:24.386
OK.

08:24.427 --> 08:27.305
He's probably out
wondering where you are.

08:27.348 --> 08:29.600
Well, please don't tell him
I'm here, OK?

08:29.641 --> 08:32.933
Yeah. Did you want
to come in?

08:36.273 --> 08:37.899
I thought

08:37.941 --> 08:41.278
I heard a noise. It sounded
like someone screaming.

08:41.320 --> 08:43.572
Yeah. I was just making
some tea.

08:43.614 --> 08:45.740
Hey, sit down.

08:54.206 --> 08:56.168
Do you want a cup?

08:56.210 --> 08:59.086
I have tea all the time.

08:59.129 --> 09:00.922
Yeah, OK.

09:13.811 --> 09:16.437
Stupid fucking bitch.

09:32.952 --> 09:35.541
So, do you want
to tell me what's wrong?

09:35.581 --> 09:38.125
Why'd you leave the hospital?

09:38.168 --> 09:40.546
It wasn't safe there.

09:43.215 --> 09:44.966
OK.

09:47.427 --> 09:49.678
Why do you think it wasn't safe?

09:49.721 --> 09:53.975
I don't know.
Just a feeling, I guess.

09:54.017 --> 09:56.976
Like when you're in a dark room

09:57.019 --> 10:00.023
but you can still feel a hand
in front of your face.

10:04.403 --> 10:07.572
What are you afraid of?

10:07.615 --> 10:09.950
That it's coming after me.

10:09.990 --> 10:13.159
Sweetheart, I'm sure
that's not true.

10:13.201 --> 10:16.874
Well, I-I had that feeling,
and I just had to get away.

10:16.916 --> 10:18.875
I had to come here.

10:18.918 --> 10:21.168
Why?

10:23.171 --> 10:25.798
To warn you.

10:25.841 --> 10:28.844
Because I think
it's after you too.

10:44.652 --> 10:46.946
Is that the bacon grease?

10:53.033 --> 10:55.830
Oh, good.

10:55.870 --> 10:57.831
You did good.

10:57.873 --> 11:00.292
What are you gonna do
with that stuff?

11:00.332 --> 11:02.043
What's that?

11:02.085 --> 11:06.173
It's a weapon, from my mother.

11:06.214 --> 11:09.969
We have her blessing,
for what it's worth.

11:14.682 --> 11:17.057
You have your spells,
she has hers.

11:17.100 --> 11:20.269
Ha! Ha! Ha! Just try not
to poke your eye out with it.

11:25.106 --> 11:29.028
So... how are you gonna
find it?

11:31.365 --> 11:33.490
It'll find me.

11:36.995 --> 11:41.291
I asked how to do what it did--
to turn on the wrong moon.

11:43.293 --> 11:47.004
I'm closer to it now,
I can feel it.

11:47.046 --> 11:50.048
And I can feel it feel me.

11:53.094 --> 11:57.224
When I go out there tonight,
I won't have to go far.

11:57.264 --> 12:01.058
It'll be waiting for me.

12:07.106 --> 12:09.485
Hey.

12:09.528 --> 12:12.113
I need you to come by here.

12:12.153 --> 12:14.240
It's not really the best time
right now.

12:14.282 --> 12:19.870
This is just really important,
and I need your help.

12:19.913 --> 12:21.706
I'll be right there.

12:27.254 --> 12:30.215
<i>I gotta go. She needs my help</i>
<i>with something important.</i>

12:30.255 --> 12:32.384
- Well, what is it?
- I don't know.

12:32.426 --> 12:35.345
- I'm going. - Hey, hey, do you really think
that's the best idea right now,

12:35.385 --> 12:37.639
with everyone out there
looking for you?

12:37.681 --> 12:40.475
I'll hide in the fucking
trunk. I'm going.

12:50.527 --> 12:52.528
It's OK. We'll handle it.

12:56.575 --> 12:59.576
- What the fuck is this all about?
- Just stay calm.

13:01.580 --> 13:03.581
OK.

13:05.582 --> 13:07.250
Sheriff?

13:07.293 --> 13:09.336
You here to help?

13:09.379 --> 13:11.798
Help with what, sir?

13:11.840 --> 13:14.216
What are you doing here?

13:14.259 --> 13:16.509
It can come back.

13:16.552 --> 13:18.806
It always comes back.

13:21.014 --> 13:23.976
I don't think
it's coming back here, sir,

13:24.019 --> 13:25.980
and the Fredericks,

13:26.019 --> 13:28.565
they could use some time alone.

13:28.605 --> 13:30.609
You understand.

13:33.235 --> 13:37.032
Tom? That thing loaded?

13:37.072 --> 13:40.283
Don't fucking touch it.

13:40.326 --> 13:42.830
- Sheriff--
- Go home.

13:42.870 --> 13:45.624
Come with us, OK?

13:57.970 --> 13:59.846
Still warm

13:59.888 --> 14:02.682
for whatever use
that brings you.

14:23.495 --> 14:25.455
Lod isn't going to like this.

14:25.495 --> 14:29.207
They want Norman's share,
they'll learn to.

14:29.250 --> 14:32.418
They knew where they were
sending the little gollywog.

14:32.461 --> 14:36.255
This was irresponsible
and reckless.

14:36.298 --> 14:38.719
First you leave the Willoughby
girl here to be discovered.

14:38.759 --> 14:40.385
Mm, tsk, tsk, tsk.

14:40.427 --> 14:42.764
- Not my handiwork.
- Regardless, it's sloppy.

14:42.806 --> 14:45.893
This was not some junkie or transient
like the others. She will be missed.

14:45.932 --> 14:48.351
What is this really about?

14:50.480 --> 14:54.442
Oh!

14:54.484 --> 14:57.320
You liked her!

14:57.360 --> 14:59.322
Perhaps you can

14:59.364 --> 15:02.868
send the next of kin something
that almost resembles a flower.

15:02.908 --> 15:04.534
Fuck you, Olivia.

15:04.576 --> 15:07.081
For years
I've been your janitor,

15:07.120 --> 15:10.082
making your messes go away.

15:10.125 --> 15:13.378
The blood on my hands because of you.
You couldn't leave this one alone?

15:13.418 --> 15:16.048
I could. I chose not to.

15:16.090 --> 15:17.883
You don't do it for me.

15:17.923 --> 15:20.259
You do it for yourself
and your little project.

15:20.301 --> 15:23.221
Being my janitor protects you
from Norman.

15:23.263 --> 15:25.599
The only people
who are gonna miss her are Lod,

15:25.639 --> 15:27.600
and now they know
the consequences

15:27.642 --> 15:29.894
of crossing me when you need
protection from them.

15:32.187 --> 15:34.774
Of course,
you could always just

15:34.816 --> 15:37.692
tender your resignation.

15:41.782 --> 15:45.744
Why is it that you're the only one who
hasn't asked me what I'm really doing?

15:45.784 --> 15:49.163
Because I don't give
a flying fuck.

15:49.206 --> 15:52.167
- You should.
- And why is that?

15:52.207 --> 15:54.500
Because it will
change the world.

15:54.543 --> 15:58.298
Yours included.

15:58.339 --> 16:00.966
The only thing I care
about us producing is money.

16:01.009 --> 16:04.302
As long as you continue,
the rest is a sandbox

16:04.345 --> 16:06.974
for you and your PhDs.

16:08.975 --> 16:11.726
I think you'll find the world
doesn't change so easily.

16:15.355 --> 16:17.524
We will see.

16:22.028 --> 16:24.447
Do you know who it is
who's killing these girls?

16:24.490 --> 16:27.909
Stop being a pussy.

16:27.951 --> 16:29.955
Clean it up.

16:56.815 --> 16:59.649
I can't move.

17:03.778 --> 17:05.781
It's hard to breathe.

17:07.784 --> 17:10.702
That's because
your neck is broken.

17:12.704 --> 17:14.374
Oh, Doctor.

17:14.413 --> 17:17.836
If only you'd listened to me.

17:19.836 --> 17:22.798
I'm...

17:22.839 --> 17:25.009
listening...

17:25.050 --> 17:27.054
now.

17:29.430 --> 17:33.601
We're both part of something
bigger than us, you and I,

17:33.643 --> 17:37.064
bigger than the not-so-different
people we work for.

17:37.105 --> 17:40.817
The only difference is

17:40.857 --> 17:44.612
I don't threaten it.

17:44.653 --> 17:46.823
She's right.

17:46.865 --> 17:49.284
I can't quit when I'm so close.

17:52.371 --> 17:54.373
I'm so sorry.

18:07.134 --> 18:09.135
Do you want to pray?

18:12.972 --> 18:15.394
No.

19:16.413 --> 19:19.207
A lighthouse
guiding a lone vessel

19:19.249 --> 19:22.710
through evil waters
if ever there was one.

19:22.750 --> 19:24.752
Full stop.

19:27.173 --> 19:29.968
He reminded himself,

19:30.009 --> 19:34.512
comma, again, comma,

19:34.555 --> 19:37.351
that whatever sacrifice

19:37.392 --> 19:41.519
of personal conscience was
required of him,

19:41.560 --> 19:44.730
comma, even his humanity, comma,

19:44.772 --> 19:49.403
was of scant consequence
to his penance.

19:49.444 --> 19:52.449
Full stop.

19:57.202 --> 19:58.872
Hey.

20:01.208 --> 20:04.625
- Tom?
- Norman.

20:12.009 --> 20:13.970
How you doing?

20:14.010 --> 20:17.015
What's that thing I said
about not being a patient?

20:19.226 --> 20:20.852
Yeah.

20:20.894 --> 20:23.520
It's not the usual luggage
people come in with.

20:23.563 --> 20:26.066
I'm here. Don't push it.

20:26.105 --> 20:29.108
Oh, no, I'm glad you're here.

20:33.614 --> 20:36.115
Why didn't it come for me?

20:36.159 --> 20:38.412
Tom,

20:38.451 --> 20:43.387
I know you think that...
in some way you were responsible--

20:43.509 --> 20:45.644
I'm not here for me.
I'm just here to tell you

20:45.765 --> 20:49.923
that another girl's gonna die,
so if you have anything

20:49.962 --> 20:53.009
to say to any of the girls
in your life,

20:53.049 --> 20:55.429
now would be the time.

21:16.824 --> 21:18.616
Letha?

21:18.659 --> 21:20.826
- Are you OK? What's going on?
- Hey.

21:20.868 --> 21:23.413
I'm really sorry. I was on
my way to meet you guys when...

21:23.457 --> 21:26.000
- something came up.
- Well, who's here?

21:26.040 --> 21:28.211
Don't freak out, OK?

21:28.251 --> 21:29.670
Who's here?

21:29.711 --> 21:31.756
Please, can you just stay here?

21:31.798 --> 21:35.174
Thank you.
Hey, Christina.

21:35.218 --> 21:39.887
I'm not gonna let
anyone hurt you. Christina.

21:39.931 --> 21:43.182
- This isn't a good idea.
- Roman,

21:43.226 --> 21:45.310
she's really scared.

21:45.353 --> 21:49.147
- Well, we're not just gonna--
It's fine. - What?

21:49.190 --> 21:52.152
- It's fine.
- Hi.

21:52.192 --> 21:55.614
Hi.

21:55.694 --> 22:00.910
â™ª Under the waves till the
birds steal the liver I grew â™ª

22:00.951 --> 22:03.871
â™ª Fall asleep in the breeze â™ª

22:03.913 --> 22:06.707
Yo. Baby on board.

22:10.211 --> 22:12.172
Christina,

22:12.211 --> 22:15.383
you know I won't let
anyone hurt you, right?

22:15.423 --> 22:17.594
I know.

22:17.634 --> 22:22.015
You know nothing's gonna go
wrong now. Right?

22:22.056 --> 22:25.893
I'm sorry I told everyone
you're a werewolf.

22:28.563 --> 22:30.815
Don't mention it.

22:41.409 --> 22:43.662
I know you're scared.

22:43.701 --> 22:45.702
I am too.

22:49.625 --> 22:51.961
Why do you think
he's coming after you?

22:52.001 --> 22:55.173
It's hard to explain.

22:58.424 --> 23:01.010
Yeah, yeah.

23:01.054 --> 23:04.307
I know the feeling.

23:06.723 --> 23:08.978
Oh, pull...
pull up over there.

23:09.019 --> 23:11.939
- What, the convenience store?
- Yeah. - Why?

23:11.980 --> 23:14.275
I gotta take a piss.
Just do it, will you?

23:14.317 --> 23:16.653
Yes, ma'am.

23:36.047 --> 23:39.008
All right,
what the fuck's going on?

23:39.048 --> 23:41.720
- I think Christina's right.
- About what?

23:41.759 --> 23:43.804
I think he's after her next.

23:43.846 --> 23:46.598
- How do you know?
- It's just a feeling.

23:46.641 --> 23:48.602
He may even know her,

23:48.643 --> 23:50.978
he may come before sundown,
so we need to be ready.

23:51.019 --> 23:53.770
What are you looking for?

23:53.814 --> 23:55.607
Fuck.

23:55.650 --> 23:57.652
This'll do.

24:04.156 --> 24:05.866
Oh, shit.

24:05.910 --> 24:09.038
<i>My brother lost his house</i>
<i>because of your father.</i>

24:13.040 --> 24:15.420
Why don't you tell your brother

24:15.461 --> 24:17.672
to be a fucking man, huh?

24:34.314 --> 24:36.481
Card declined.

24:39.152 --> 24:41.818
Uh... I got cash.

24:41.862 --> 24:43.820
Want me to call your mother?

24:43.864 --> 24:47.701
No, thanks. I'm fine.

24:49.868 --> 24:52.664
What the fuck did you do
to this guy?

24:52.707 --> 24:55.460
We had a...
misunderstanding.

24:55.500 --> 24:59.547
Jesus. I've seen
your misunderstandings.

25:01.548 --> 25:04.634
Hi. I'm sorry about this
and him.

25:04.678 --> 25:06.845
No one knows he's
a bigger asshole than I do,

25:06.885 --> 25:08.765
but we really need this,

25:08.807 --> 25:10.598
and I'm broke till payday.

25:10.642 --> 25:14.435
Lots of people broke because
of this asshole's family.

25:14.479 --> 25:17.146
How about an IOU?

25:17.190 --> 25:19.482
I'm good for it.

25:19.526 --> 25:23.068
I-O-fuck you,

25:23.112 --> 25:25.070
Rumancek.

25:25.114 --> 25:27.701
I'm sorry.

25:27.740 --> 25:30.618
I haven't said that
much in my life, but I am.

25:30.662 --> 25:33.872
I insulted a lot of people,
and, uh,

25:33.913 --> 25:36.875
you would have been right
to kick my ass.

25:36.915 --> 25:40.712
I'm a spoiled prick
and I would have deserved it.

25:40.755 --> 25:43.882
Look, if you wanna take a swing
at me now,

25:43.923 --> 25:46.009
I won't stop you.

26:06.364 --> 26:09.325
- Whew...
- Everything all right?

26:09.365 --> 26:11.617
Yeah. Why wouldn't it be?

26:38.144 --> 26:41.146
The boys are in the chapel.

26:47.820 --> 26:50.615
<i>Are they</i>
<i>going to stop it?</i>

26:52.617 --> 26:55.413
Well, they have some ideas.

26:55.453 --> 26:58.957
Letha's home and fine.

26:58.999 --> 27:01.544
Your mother...

27:04.046 --> 27:06.382
...your mother and I are...

27:06.423 --> 27:08.217
complicated.

27:13.431 --> 27:17.268
I'm sorry that it meant
lying to you.

27:19.813 --> 27:24.607
I've been lying about it so long I almost forgot
there was anyone who still believed it, but...

27:24.651 --> 27:27.862
doesn't make it
any less crummy.

27:34.451 --> 27:36.243
You're a lamp.

27:38.247 --> 27:40.539
You shine on people.

27:40.583 --> 27:43.336
You're either gonna show
what's best in them

27:43.375 --> 27:46.422
or what's most crummy.

27:46.462 --> 27:49.592
You always got to see
the best of me

27:49.634 --> 27:53.636
because there you were
lighting the way, so...

27:53.680 --> 27:59.017
it's even worse how you had to learn
about my shit-heel side, but...

27:59.057 --> 28:04.020
that's your tragedy, and...

28:04.064 --> 28:06.901
nothing breaks my heart more.

28:06.942 --> 28:09.278
You're always gonna be
surrounded by people

28:09.318 --> 28:11.320
who don't deserve you.

28:19.497 --> 28:23.960
Something else
I gotta tell you. Um...

28:24.000 --> 28:26.627
the last victim...

28:28.631 --> 28:30.842
...it was Jenny Fredericks.

28:30.884 --> 28:33.845
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

28:33.885 --> 28:36.054
I-I know
what she meant to you.

28:41.308 --> 28:43.354
Oh, sweetheart.

28:47.525 --> 28:49.736
Shelley.

28:49.777 --> 28:52.194
Shelley!

28:55.324 --> 28:57.326
SHELLEY!

29:14.844 --> 29:16.846
Shelley!

29:53.883 --> 29:55.969
Are you sure we're safe here?

29:56.009 --> 29:57.971
As safe as we're gonna be.

30:03.768 --> 30:05.810
Hey.

30:05.853 --> 30:08.145
Nothing's gonna hurt you.

30:08.188 --> 30:10.190
I won't let it.

30:33.211 --> 30:35.589
You know...

30:37.593 --> 30:40.721
...I kissed you once.

30:52.441 --> 30:54.692
It was right
when you moved here.

30:54.733 --> 30:57.903
It was my first.

30:57.945 --> 31:01.490
I never told anybody that,
not even the twins.

31:03.911 --> 31:08.248
They lost their virginity the summer before.
It was all they ever talked about.

31:08.288 --> 31:11.000
I wanted the experience.
You know, it's what writers do.

31:15.838 --> 31:18.592
That's why I researched
how to turn.

31:22.011 --> 31:25.016
But where do you start?

31:27.018 --> 31:29.353
What do you mean turn?

31:37.403 --> 31:39.238
As far as I know,

31:39.278 --> 31:41.990
you're either born one,
bitten by one,

31:42.031 --> 31:45.826
or in the rarer cases,
a person chooses it.

31:49.248 --> 31:51.834
They drink from the paw print
of one. Look at him.

31:51.875 --> 31:53.836
What do you think would
drive a person to that?

31:53.876 --> 31:55.586
You wouldn't try it?

31:55.627 --> 31:59.717
Me? I think I see enough
monsters in the world already.

31:59.759 --> 32:04.511
<i>It's like I said: experience</i>
<i>is a writer's material.</i>

32:06.847 --> 32:10.019
And you had so many stories,
and I wanted my own,

32:10.059 --> 32:12.688
and I wanted to be
as free as you.

32:22.364 --> 32:24.909
I wasn't optimistic. I mean,

32:24.951 --> 32:27.576
who thinks something like that
is gonna work?

32:30.579 --> 32:35.211
I felt pretty silly.

33:42.153 --> 33:45.114
And then it came--

33:45.154 --> 33:47.115
the harvest moon.

33:47.156 --> 33:49.491
Jesus Christ.

33:54.038 --> 33:56.209
- Get her out of here.
- What's going on? Roman?

33:56.250 --> 33:59.336
Come on, you need to get out of here.
You need to get out of here.

33:59.376 --> 34:01.337
Stay back.
You need to let Peter do this.

34:01.380 --> 34:03.507
Do what?
Where is he taking her?

34:03.548 --> 34:05.843
- I need you to come with me.
- OK.

34:16.603 --> 34:18.313
Get on your knees.

34:24.152 --> 34:27.864
- Get your hands off me!
- No! No! OK?

34:31.077 --> 34:32.619
Don't move.

35:04.360 --> 35:06.362
Can you control it?

35:08.655 --> 35:11.117
Last night, was it something
that happened,

35:11.157 --> 35:12.784
or did you make it happen?

35:16.329 --> 35:18.291
Did you make yourself turn,

35:18.331 --> 35:20.500
or did you hear--
did you hear your other name?

35:25.088 --> 35:27.800
Answer me or I'll
choke the life out of you.

35:27.840 --> 35:30.844
I decided to.
I wanted to.

35:34.181 --> 35:36.474
OK.

35:38.476 --> 35:41.355
If you decide to turn tonight,
you're gonna die.

35:41.396 --> 35:44.942
Are you gonna kill me, Peter?

35:44.983 --> 35:48.445
Yes.

35:48.487 --> 35:51.489
Do you hate me?

35:53.492 --> 35:55.452
No.

35:55.494 --> 35:57.788
I don't hate you.

36:04.128 --> 36:06.088
Why her?

36:06.130 --> 36:09.675
Why did you go to her?

36:17.931 --> 36:20.226
I knew you were in here.

36:20.268 --> 36:24.523
I saw from the clinic window you
go in and then I went to look.

36:28.402 --> 36:30.737
Because when I saw you in here

36:30.777 --> 36:33.699
with your ugly fucking thing
in that whore!

36:33.739 --> 36:37.577
- Roman, let go of me!
- Stop, OK? Stop!

36:37.619 --> 36:41.414
Listen to me! It's her.

36:41.456 --> 36:44.960
She's the fucking vargulf.
It's fucking her!

36:45.001 --> 36:48.630
I wanted more than anything

36:48.672 --> 36:52.759
to feel her fear on my tongue

36:52.800 --> 36:55.762
and her bones crunch
beneath my teeth...

36:57.597 --> 37:00.559
...and her blood run down
the fur on my neck.

37:05.563 --> 37:07.440
It's OK.

37:09.443 --> 37:11.820
You can kill me
as long as you don't hate me.

37:15.074 --> 37:19.369
And you should do it now
while you still can.

37:21.371 --> 37:25.083
It's already happening.
You haven't got a lot of time.

37:32.632 --> 37:35.052
I can't turn it around

37:35.094 --> 37:38.389
any more than you can
turn around night and day.

37:38.431 --> 37:41.016
You do what you have to
while it's still day.

37:41.056 --> 37:42.809
You made me.

37:42.851 --> 37:45.478
- I'm yours.
- God help me.

37:47.481 --> 37:49.065
Oh!

37:49.108 --> 37:52.027
Oh, oh...

37:52.068 --> 37:55.239
I can feel it coming
'cause I'm getting wet.

37:57.282 --> 37:59.909
So this must be
what it feels like to come.

38:11.505 --> 38:14.132
I've never
heard my other name.

38:26.103 --> 38:30.023
In the summer, that
place came back to haunt her dreams.

38:30.065 --> 38:33.277
- Go into it! Go further!
- Go, keep going.

38:33.318 --> 38:34.402
- Keep going!
- Keep going,

38:34.445 --> 38:36.655
- Chrissy. Do it.
- Do it!

38:36.695 --> 38:40.451
<i>All their dirty little stories,
all the things they did,</i>

38:40.492 --> 38:42.661
those fucking cunts!

38:42.702 --> 38:45.664
All the things
they expected of her

38:45.704 --> 38:49.335
but filled her with so much fear she
couldn't even dream about them!

38:53.130 --> 38:55.465
She hid it all away in a hole.

38:58.177 --> 39:00.219
You're going to lose your soul.

39:02.556 --> 39:05.684
<i>But the more she filled it,</i>
<i>the more she hid</i>

39:05.724 --> 39:09.061
<i>from those whispers,</i>
<i>the stronger they became.</i>

39:09.103 --> 39:12.440
That's the thing with whispers.
You know,

39:12.483 --> 39:16.570
you put a thousand of them
together and you get a howl.

39:24.577 --> 39:27.456
<i>And so the night</i>
<i>before the harvest moon...</i>

39:32.378 --> 39:35.380
...she made a choice.

39:35.422 --> 39:38.467
She went down the hole.

40:04.159 --> 40:06.536
<i>She didn't know.</i>

40:06.579 --> 40:10.541
And she's very, very sorry
for everything that happened.

40:55.001 --> 40:57.420
No! Peter!

40:57.463 --> 41:02.259
- Peter! Let me go!
- No!

41:02.300 --> 41:06.221
- We've gotta stay away!
- Peter! Peter! Roman,

41:06.262 --> 41:08.056
let me go!

41:51.391 --> 41:55.018
Peter, stop!
Peter, stop!

41:55.061 --> 41:58.273
PETER! NO!

41:58.315 --> 42:01.108
PETER!

42:07.782 --> 42:10.577
PETER! NO!

42:25.634 --> 42:28.052
PETER! PETER!

42:38.605 --> 42:40.481
PETER!

43:43.043 --> 43:47.257
Run!

43:47.297 --> 43:50.760
Come on, you little bitch!

43:50.802 --> 43:53.387
Come on, you little bitch!

43:53.429 --> 43:55.474
Come on!

44:04.775 --> 44:07.402
Roman, it's locked!
