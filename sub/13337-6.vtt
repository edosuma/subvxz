WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:00.200
.

00:10.040 --> 00:11.600
The Geordies are back

00:11.680 --> 00:14.400
and we're leaving the Toon
and hitting Greece.

00:14.480 --> 00:17.000
Greece, you're about to get done.

00:17.080 --> 00:18.840
(cheering)

00:18.920 --> 00:20.400
Come on!

00:21.840 --> 00:23.440
It's gonna be pool parties.

00:23.520 --> 00:25.280
Boat parties.

00:26.080 --> 00:27.200
More drama.

00:28.600 --> 00:29.920
Fuck this shit!

00:31.760 --> 00:32.880
More tashing on.

00:35.760 --> 00:37.280
More fucking tragedy.

00:37.360 --> 00:39.640
(shouting)
Slag!

00:41.120 --> 00:42.720
(sighs)

00:42.800 --> 00:45.240
Don't fucking ever
speak to me again.

00:48.440 --> 00:49.960
Total carnage.

00:52.160 --> 00:54.840
Fuck. Shit. What have I done now?

00:58.080 --> 00:59.880
And a shit load of bucking, like.

01:03.000 --> 01:07.560
Greece, the Geordie gods are coming.
Time to get immortal.

01:11.520 --> 01:14.040
I'm buzzin'
for me first lad's night out.

01:16.440 --> 01:19.800
When we walk in that club,
the lads will shit themselves.

01:22.320 --> 01:23.400
I feel sick.

01:26.640 --> 01:29.600
So Holly's upset because
Kyle pulled a bird. Fuck off.

01:30.680 --> 01:34.040
What do girls do
when they get fucked over by lads?

01:34.120 --> 01:36.320
We fuck with their stuff.

01:36.400 --> 01:39.320
Taking the girls back to the villa?
That's stupidity.

01:39.400 --> 01:40.840
Know your limits.

01:40.920 --> 01:43.320
All the girls are awake.
Alert, alert.

01:43.400 --> 01:45.920
Every single lad in the house
to the shag pad.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.720
What the fuck is goin' on there?

01:47.800 --> 01:49.720
Open the fucking door!

01:50.760 --> 01:52.680
Psycho Charlotte has flipped.

01:52.760 --> 01:56.640
Everyone's lying, everyone's
being two faced and it's awful.

01:56.720 --> 01:59.960
The boy-girl divide
is bigger than ever.

02:00.040 --> 02:01.480
(screams)

02:01.560 --> 02:03.440
It's not normally like this.

02:05.160 --> 02:07.360
I should have a degree
in pulling women.

02:07.440 --> 02:09.840
I'd never kiss anyone
without a six pack.

02:09.920 --> 02:12.440
I'm a natural beauty.
Real boobs, real hair.

02:12.520 --> 02:14.480
I'm gonna tear the place up.

02:14.560 --> 02:16.800
I'm totally crackers, me, like.

02:16.880 --> 02:18.520
I'm preened to perfection.

02:18.600 --> 02:20.720
I'm cheeky and full of mischief.

02:20.800 --> 02:22.560
I'm fit, flirty and I've got FFs.

02:22.640 --> 02:24.960
I'm gonna make sparks fly.

02:25.040 --> 02:27.680
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

02:39.000 --> 02:42.760
'Last night, Kyle brought two girls
back and the lads helped him.'

02:42.840 --> 02:45.600
It's pathetic.
Me and the girls are fucking fumin'.

02:45.680 --> 02:47.920
The divide is back with a vengeance.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.360
I know that I can never speak
to Kyle again,

02:50.440 --> 02:53.640
and it'll be a very long time
before I speak to any of the lads.

02:53.720 --> 02:55.800
I am so disappointed in the boys.

02:55.880 --> 02:59.440
After the way they've disrespected
Holly, they can all do one.

02:59.520 --> 03:03.200
You've been so brave. You haven't
shed one tear. I'm so proud of ya.

03:03.280 --> 03:05.240
You know when you're just done.

03:05.320 --> 03:07.560
'Everything that Kyle told me
was a lie.'

03:07.640 --> 03:09.960
I know the truth
and he is not worth my tears.

03:10.040 --> 03:13.280
I'll never, ever speak to him again,
Holly. I hate him.

03:13.360 --> 03:15.880
'I'm still so angry at Kyle.'

03:15.960 --> 03:19.760
He's a fanny.
A big, hairy, inconsiderate fanny,

03:19.840 --> 03:21.520
and I hope he gets thrush.

03:26.440 --> 03:27.840
Best night I've ever had.

03:30.120 --> 03:32.080
"Two-faced cunt, sheep, liar."

03:32.160 --> 03:34.720
'Is this what happens
when you cross the girls?'

03:34.800 --> 03:36.720
What's next, write a nasty poem?

03:36.800 --> 03:38.320
How are you two-faced?

03:38.400 --> 03:40.120
Cos I said I wasn't gonna pull,

03:40.200 --> 03:42.400
but the fact is,
I was always gonna pull.

03:46.760 --> 03:47.840
(laughs)

03:47.920 --> 03:50.280
Last night I pulled,
which I wanted to do

03:50.360 --> 03:52.200
and I thought it would help Holly.

03:52.280 --> 03:55.360
'Only time will tell if it's
helped her or made her worse.'

03:55.440 --> 03:58.120
Probably in the long run,
this is what she needed.

03:58.200 --> 04:00.600
I've been cruel to be kind.

04:00.680 --> 04:04.000
'Kyle's saying this is
the only way for Holly to move on.'

04:04.080 --> 04:07.160
You're deluded if you think
anyone's gonna buy that.

04:07.240 --> 04:10.960
Obviously things like last night,
we're gonna all stick together.

04:11.040 --> 04:13.320
I know I put the lads
in a horrible position

04:13.400 --> 04:16.000
and the girls probably hate
what they'd done.

04:16.080 --> 04:19.240
I'm not gonna lie, it was nice
to be one of the lads for once.

04:22.320 --> 04:23.640
(phone rings)

04:28.120 --> 04:29.200
Hello.

04:29.280 --> 04:32.440
Anna's on the phone and she said
we've got to pack up our shit

04:32.520 --> 04:35.120
and get to the port now.
We're on our way to Ios.

04:36.840 --> 04:39.600
We're going to Ios. Fucking get in!
Where's Ios?

04:40.440 --> 04:44.000
The atmosphere's crap here.
Surely Ios will be a lot better,

04:44.080 --> 04:46.480
so we need to get
the fuck out of here like.

04:46.560 --> 04:49.040
'We get to the port
and all I can see is yachts.'

04:49.120 --> 04:52.280
If Anna's pulled this off,
she is a fucking legend.

04:52.360 --> 04:54.720
(Holly)Oh, my God, there's Anna!

04:56.120 --> 04:58.600
Hi, guys.
Pure wiggin'!

04:58.680 --> 05:02.520
Anna's leanin' on a flag pole. She
must be wishin' it was my chopper,

05:02.600 --> 05:05.680
but, Anna, ye'd knar
if I was at full mast, mate.

05:09.120 --> 05:11.880
What the fuck? Anna wants me
to go and sit on a boat

05:11.960 --> 05:15.800
and play happy families after
everything that happened last night.

05:15.880 --> 05:19.400
'Fuck, there's beds on this boat
so we're gonna be livin' on here.'

05:19.480 --> 05:23.280
Angry ex, cramped boat, that's
not gonna be awkward at all like.

05:25.040 --> 05:27.760
'Let's get this straight.
We're all not speaking.'

05:27.840 --> 05:29.840
Shit.
We're gonna need a bigger boat.

05:29.920 --> 05:33.480
Everybody, please meet your captain.
(all) Hi, Captain.

05:33.560 --> 05:35.120
What's his name?
Zachary.

05:35.200 --> 05:36.640
(all) Zachary.

05:36.720 --> 05:39.160
Chloe, you'll be needing this.
(laughter)

05:39.240 --> 05:41.720
Anna's rocked up in
her shit kitten heels

05:41.800 --> 05:44.200
with this life jacket
because I can't swim.

05:44.280 --> 05:45.640
Do I wear this to bed?

05:45.720 --> 05:47.960
I guess I can see the funny side.

05:48.040 --> 05:49.880
Orange is definitely my colour.

05:49.960 --> 05:53.600
I'm gonna leave you to it. Have a
safe journey to Ios with our captain.

05:53.680 --> 05:54.920
(all) Bye, Anna.

05:57.320 --> 05:59.440
Bye, Anna!
Bye!

05:59.520 --> 06:00.960
See you fuckin' never!

06:01.040 --> 06:04.840
We're pullin' off and we're
heading to Ios. See ya later, Zante!

06:05.640 --> 06:09.840
We're off, bitches! Bring it on!

06:11.240 --> 06:13.440
This is amazing!

06:13.520 --> 06:16.520
I feel like we're on Titanic.
Holy shit!

06:16.600 --> 06:18.720
I can't wait to be surrounded
by sea men,

06:18.800 --> 06:22.120
and hopefully this time
not all over me face.

06:22.200 --> 06:25.720
This boat is actually pretty cool.
Open seas, blue skies.

06:25.800 --> 06:27.520
Maybe it won't be that bad.

06:33.440 --> 06:34.840
(all) Whoa!

06:34.920 --> 06:38.600
All of a sudden, this boat
starts fucking movin' around.

06:38.680 --> 06:41.840
'I tell you what, it's a bit
choppy out there, captain.'

06:43.440 --> 06:45.640
What the fuck is goin' on?

06:46.920 --> 06:48.120
(screaming)

06:48.200 --> 06:51.800
This captain is just driving like
Chloe givin' a fuckin' blow job.

06:51.880 --> 06:53.600
All over the fucking place.

06:53.680 --> 06:55.760
(screaming)

06:55.840 --> 06:57.760
This is actually terrifying.

06:59.160 --> 07:00.160
Shit!

07:01.720 --> 07:04.880
The boat's rocking,
we're practically on our side,

07:04.960 --> 07:07.520
and I feel like
there's a possibility of death.

07:11.400 --> 07:15.000
Fucking hell. I thought
Hurricane Holly was scary last night,

07:15.080 --> 07:17.160
but this is another level.

07:18.440 --> 07:22.440
This could be the end. Oh, goodness.

07:26.520 --> 07:29.760
It's not even bad now.
I know, it's stopped. I know.

07:29.840 --> 07:32.680
The boat started to slow down.
Are we there yet?

07:32.760 --> 07:35.960
'We pull up to this island
and we're all looking around.'

07:36.040 --> 07:37.080
Land ahoy!

07:37.160 --> 07:39.880
Is this Ios?
Cos if it is, it looks fucking shit.

07:39.960 --> 07:43.040
Fuck. Oh, my God,
this looks like a ghost town.

07:44.160 --> 07:48.040
I can see loads of fishing boats.
Where the fuck are we?

07:51.600 --> 07:55.720
We're all waiting for Captain Zachary
to tell us what's going on.

07:55.800 --> 07:58.440
I hope he hurries up
cos this is getting awkward.

07:58.520 --> 08:00.680
Hello, hello.
(all) Hi!

08:00.760 --> 08:02.320
Everybody OK?
(all) Yeah.

08:02.400 --> 08:03.800
Why's the boat stopped?

08:03.880 --> 08:08.640
So we had some waves,
so we came here for your safety,

08:08.720 --> 08:11.680
and this place is called Kythnos.

08:11.760 --> 08:15.600
'The captain couldn't make it to Ios
so we're stuck in Kythnos.'

08:15.680 --> 08:19.160
We're stuck in this confined space
with all the girls

08:19.240 --> 08:22.160
and none of wuh are talking.
Excellent.

08:24.280 --> 08:26.880
OK, thank you.
(all) Thank you.

08:26.960 --> 08:29.440
'If Captain Zachary
doesn't find a club for me,

08:29.520 --> 08:32.920
there's gonna be a mutiny cos
Captain Turbo will be taking over.'

08:33.000 --> 08:35.480
Isn't that right, Polly? (squawks)

08:39.880 --> 08:41.720
'Everyone looks pissed off.'

08:41.800 --> 08:44.600
Oh, well, let's make the best
of a bad situation.

08:44.680 --> 08:47.160
Guys, this is fucking shit today.

08:47.240 --> 08:50.560
It's been brutal, and I think
the only way to get through it

08:50.640 --> 08:52.320
is if we have a drink together.

08:52.400 --> 08:55.200
And put everything behind us
and just have a drink.

08:55.280 --> 08:58.880
'Nathan seems to have forgotten
that we're pissed off with them.'

08:58.960 --> 09:01.680
He's just going on like
nothing's even happened.

09:01.760 --> 09:05.880
To be fair to Nathan, he's trying to
make the best out of a bad situation.

09:05.960 --> 09:09.680
But all the girls have still
got faces like smacked arses.

09:16.040 --> 09:18.640
Not awkward at all.

09:22.440 --> 09:23.880
You all right?
What?

09:23.960 --> 09:27.160
You all right? To be honest,
I didn't finish with Charlotte,

09:27.240 --> 09:30.240
I didn't finish with Marnie,
I didn't finish with Chloe.

09:30.320 --> 09:31.840
All the girls are against us.

09:31.920 --> 09:34.640
Me and Holly
might not be together any more,

09:34.720 --> 09:37.760
but I haven't asked the lads
to stop talking to Holly.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.920
They will talk to you again, right.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.960
The worst thing you can possibly do
when they're not

09:44.040 --> 09:45.880
is let them know you're bothered.

09:45.960 --> 09:48.360
I can see Kyle's arse
is starting to twitch.

09:48.440 --> 09:50.560
Mate, stay strong, stay focused,

09:50.640 --> 09:53.240
keep it together
and we will get through this.

09:59.080 --> 10:01.720
We've got the booze,
and let's just hope the girls

10:01.800 --> 10:04.080
have got a fucking smile
on their faces.

10:04.160 --> 10:07.160
(Gary)Girls!
Howay, Holls. Your time to shine.

10:09.040 --> 10:10.800
And have they? Have they fuck.

10:10.880 --> 10:13.080
After everything that happened,

10:13.160 --> 10:16.560
I just don't really wanna sit
and play happy families.

10:16.640 --> 10:18.320
So I'm gonna go to bed.

10:18.400 --> 10:21.600
Yeah, we're gonna come with you.
Night.

10:21.680 --> 10:25.280
Girls, I'm trying my hardest and
you're just making it difficult,

10:25.360 --> 10:28.440
so bore off. I just want
to have fucking fun, man.

10:28.520 --> 10:31.360
Well, we just got pied.
Well, to the boys.

10:32.520 --> 10:36.000
The boys thought a few drinks on
the boat would make everything OK.

10:36.080 --> 10:39.960
You're a bunch of bellends and
we don't wanna be friends with you.

10:51.600 --> 10:56.080
I wonder how the lads are dealing
with the custard pie this morning.

10:56.160 --> 10:58.320
It's not the first time
they've been pied

10:58.400 --> 11:00.840
and it definitely won't be the last.
(laughs)

11:00.920 --> 11:04.320
They can't just pick and choose
when they want to involve us.

11:04.400 --> 11:06.600
Last night,
the boys did make an effort,

11:06.680 --> 11:10.280
but it takes more than a bottle
of rose wine to sweeten me up.

11:10.360 --> 11:13.640
I'm not just gonna forgive them
cos we're trapped on a boat.

11:15.920 --> 11:18.360
I swear to god the boat
was moving around

11:18.440 --> 11:21.160
cos I was doing
fucking back flips in me sleep.

11:21.240 --> 11:22.840
'I cannot wait to get to Ios.'

11:22.920 --> 11:27.720
I sort of expected them to pie
us off and not have a drink with us,

11:27.800 --> 11:29.840
but I'm a bit gutted that they did.

11:29.920 --> 11:33.320
I didn't expect them to sit down
and have a drink, to be honest.

11:33.400 --> 11:34.720
Didn't ya?
Did I fuck.

11:34.800 --> 11:37.960
Last night the girls pied us,
and to make matters worse,

11:38.040 --> 11:40.800
I've got to share a bed
with these smelly bastards.

11:40.880 --> 11:43.080
(farts)
(laughs)

11:43.160 --> 11:44.840
'Today can only get better.'

11:49.520 --> 11:53.080
Thank you. We have eventually
arrived in fucking Ios.

11:53.160 --> 11:55.360
Look at that. Now that looks sick.

11:55.440 --> 11:57.560
Whoo! Bring it on.

11:58.880 --> 12:01.080
# Ios, we're coming for you

12:01.160 --> 12:04.200
# Ios... I need a poo

12:04.280 --> 12:06.440
# Do you have a toilet? #
(laughs)

12:06.520 --> 12:09.840
So buzzin'. I'm just happy
to see civili-fucking-sation.

12:09.920 --> 12:14.040
I can't believe that epic journey is
over with and we've arrived safely.

12:14.120 --> 12:15.760
Cheers, Captain Zachary.

12:17.680 --> 12:20.960
Get the paddle boats out,
go swimming. We fucking deserve it.

12:21.040 --> 12:22.960
(phone rings)
I'll go and get it.

12:23.760 --> 12:27.600
We've just got to Ios and Anna is
already on the phone. What the fuck?

12:27.680 --> 12:30.200
I can't believe
we don't get a day off.

12:30.280 --> 12:32.000
Hello, ye all right?

12:35.200 --> 12:37.920
And it's Holly, Chloe and Charlotte.
Buzzin'.

12:40.400 --> 12:42.120
I'm not saying that to them.

12:42.200 --> 12:44.120
I can't believe Anna's tellin' me

12:44.200 --> 12:46.960
to tell Holly
not to neck on with the punters.

12:47.040 --> 12:49.760
God, I hope she doesn't neck on
with the punters.

12:49.840 --> 12:52.960
She said no necking on or anything.
I'll keep that in mind.

12:53.040 --> 12:56.200
Great, thanks, Kyle.
I bet you fuckin' loved saying that.

12:56.280 --> 12:58.040
Come on, let's go and get ready.

12:58.120 --> 13:00.520
Knock 'em dead, girls.
Knock 'em dead.

13:00.600 --> 13:03.960
Normally I hate work, but today
it's a blessing in disguise

13:04.040 --> 13:06.840
because all I wanna do
is get away from the boys.

13:12.120 --> 13:16.480
This is gonna be the first time
you're single at work. I know.

13:16.560 --> 13:19.600
I'm not gonna stoop to his level
and neck on with people.

13:19.680 --> 13:20.760
It's not my style.

13:20.840 --> 13:23.920
'Holly should get back on the horse
and get over Kyle.'

13:24.000 --> 13:26.680
Finding another willy
is the way forward.

13:26.760 --> 13:29.920
Does my bum look good?
Amazing. Boys are gonna love that.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.640
Really? Yeah.
Come on then.

13:33.440 --> 13:37.520
(screams) So here we go, off on
our speed boat to Tashos Touros.

13:37.600 --> 13:39.600
Bon voyage!
Wanker!

13:39.680 --> 13:42.280
I'm not really happy about
being stuck on the boat

13:42.360 --> 13:44.160
but at least I'm not going to work,

13:44.240 --> 13:47.720
cos if there's one thing that I hate
more than the boys, it's work.

13:53.080 --> 13:56.760
Hi, everyone!
Welcome to Tashos Touros!

13:56.840 --> 14:00.600
Let's have some fun in the sun!

14:00.680 --> 14:02.160
(cheering)

14:02.240 --> 14:07.840
My two sexy assistants here
are both single!

14:07.920 --> 14:11.280
(cheering)
(whooping)

14:11.360 --> 14:15.200
'We get to work and there's actually
some half decent lads here.'

14:15.280 --> 14:16.640
But it is far too soon.

14:16.720 --> 14:21.600
Right, this game is called
G marks the spot.

14:21.680 --> 14:25.440
You're gonna be blindfolded
and we have to direct you towards us

14:25.520 --> 14:28.680
to get the penis shaped object
in between our legs.

14:28.760 --> 14:32.640
Nothing is going near, in,
or around my vaginal area.

14:32.720 --> 14:34.920
'I'm gonna leave this one.'
Go!

14:38.840 --> 14:40.680
(indistinct shouting, screams)

14:40.760 --> 14:43.880
I don't think you need to
actually put it in the vagina!

14:43.960 --> 14:45.640
What the fuck is this?

14:49.120 --> 14:51.000
(cheering)

14:51.080 --> 14:52.800
In ya face! In ya face!

14:52.880 --> 14:55.160
'I'm actually having
a really good time.'

14:55.240 --> 14:57.920
Me and the girls are so close,
they're my sisters.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.320
Fuck the brothers.

14:59.400 --> 15:02.120
'Holly looks like she's having
an amazing time.'

15:02.200 --> 15:05.320
Could this be the beginning
of single, fun Holly?

15:05.400 --> 15:08.320
Right, yous. We hope you've had fun.
(cheering)

15:09.480 --> 15:12.880
It's time to get back to the boat
and get ready for tonight.

15:21.320 --> 15:24.320
'We're getting ready
for our first night in the yacht.'

15:24.400 --> 15:27.080
Even though the girls
haven't spoke to us all day,

15:27.160 --> 15:29.800
hopefully tonight
we'll have a good night.

15:29.880 --> 15:33.520
We need to sort your face out.
You literally look like a lobster.

15:33.600 --> 15:37.200
'The girls are obviously
massively jealous of my tan.'

15:37.280 --> 15:40.000
Everybody knows
you've got to get the red twinge

15:40.080 --> 15:42.600
to have the brown minge. D'uh!

15:51.960 --> 15:54.880
There's still tension
between the boys and the girls,

15:54.960 --> 15:58.400
but fuck it, we don't have to talk
to them. Let's go on a bar crawl.

16:00.040 --> 16:02.440
Are we arguing with the girls
or not?

16:02.520 --> 16:05.960
I think tonight's gonna be good
cos they actually talked to us.

16:06.040 --> 16:07.880
What did they say?
"Howay, lads."

16:07.960 --> 16:09.760
"Howay, lads?" That's fuck all.

16:09.840 --> 16:11.400
Things have been awkward,

16:11.480 --> 16:14.600
but tonight I want a mint time
with the lads and get mortal.

16:17.880 --> 16:21.520
We get to the first bar
and it's pretty, not very bouncing.

16:21.600 --> 16:25.200
'I'm just gonna stay the hell away
from all them boys.'

16:30.360 --> 16:34.160
It's still really awkward. I'm happy
gettin' drunk with the girls.

16:42.480 --> 16:43.640
(laughter)

16:48.720 --> 16:51.160
'I'm trying to clear up
the other night,

16:51.240 --> 16:54.360
cos me and Charlotte have been
in this situation before.'

16:54.440 --> 16:58.400
But this is between Holly and Kyle.
Everyone else should be gettin' on.

17:07.680 --> 17:11.280
'Gary, this divide isn't about Kyle
trying to be one of the lads.'

17:11.360 --> 17:13.760
It's about having respect
for your family,

17:13.840 --> 17:16.080
and at the minute,
divorce is on the cards.

17:25.280 --> 17:27.320
Whoa, whoa.
There is a fuckin' first.

17:27.400 --> 17:30.640
You're telling me that
I've got nothing to apologise for.

17:30.720 --> 17:33.640
Two seconds there,
I'm just gonna polish me halo.

17:39.840 --> 17:41.000
Ow!

17:43.800 --> 17:45.800
'Time for the next bar, Lost Boys.'

17:45.880 --> 17:48.480
If there's any lost boys in there,
I'll find 'em.

17:49.360 --> 17:51.840
'Oh, wait. It's dead in here.'

17:51.920 --> 17:55.560
This is gonna get really awkward,
especially with the divide.

17:55.640 --> 17:58.360
'Thank fuck there is beer pong
to distract wuh.'

18:04.640 --> 18:07.960
I don't like beer and I don't
like ping pong. Sounds shit.

18:16.040 --> 18:17.200
Enough of this.

18:17.280 --> 18:20.480
I know I got pied when I asked
before, but I'm gonna ask again.

18:20.560 --> 18:21.840
You know what they say,

18:21.920 --> 18:24.720
"A family that plays together,
stays together."

18:27.040 --> 18:31.120
Things are still a bit frosty,
but this can't go on forever.

18:31.200 --> 18:33.400
Fuck it. Let's play beer pong!

18:43.880 --> 18:46.880
Chloe's used to catching balls
in her mouth,

18:46.960 --> 18:49.400
not launching them into cups.

18:49.480 --> 18:51.840
(screaming)

18:51.920 --> 18:54.920
Karma is a fuckin' bitch.

18:58.080 --> 19:01.000
So we haven't been talkin'
for all this time,

19:01.080 --> 19:03.760
and all it's taken is some beer,
some plastic cups

19:03.840 --> 19:05.960
and some ping pong balls?
Fuck's sake.

19:10.360 --> 19:13.920
(Holly)'I do feel as though I'm
gettin' closer to the boys again.'

19:14.000 --> 19:17.480
I don't necessarily need
an apology from the boys.

19:17.560 --> 19:20.840
I just need them to make an effort.
Kyle can fuck off.

19:25.800 --> 19:27.720
Why is Scott talkin' to Marnie?

19:27.800 --> 19:30.360
If he makes an effort with a girl,
it should be me.

19:30.440 --> 19:32.320
I can't help it. I'm so jealous.

19:33.840 --> 19:34.920
(cheering)

19:35.760 --> 19:38.080
Yes!
(both laugh)

19:42.720 --> 19:45.880
'I'm lookin' a bit grumpy
so Scott come over to cheer us up.'

19:45.960 --> 19:47.720
I'm not gonna lie, it has.

19:55.800 --> 19:59.600
Scott's sayin' he doesn't fancy
Marnie. I'm not sure I believe him,

19:59.680 --> 20:02.200
but I'm gonna go with it
cos it makes us happy.

20:07.600 --> 20:11.240
Tonight has been pure wicked.
We've had no kick offs at all,

20:11.320 --> 20:13.480
and the girls are starting
to talk to us.

20:13.560 --> 20:14.920
Back to the boat!

20:15.000 --> 20:16.640
'Everyone's kinda talkin'.'

20:16.720 --> 20:19.680
Let's keep this positivity
and get back to the boat.

20:21.120 --> 20:23.400
(beatboxes) Yeah!

20:23.480 --> 20:26.720
(hiccups)
Oh. That was a random hiccup.

20:28.600 --> 20:32.280
(hiccups) These are really
takin' us by surprise now.

20:37.680 --> 20:39.160
'Tonight's been mint.'

20:39.240 --> 20:42.360
'We get back to the boat and
decide to play who do you fancy.'

20:42.440 --> 20:44.320
This'll be interesting.

20:44.400 --> 20:46.960
Well, I'll go.
So who is it?

20:47.040 --> 20:50.000
Marns. I'm not gonna lie.
(cheering)

20:51.440 --> 20:54.280
Yes, I do fancy Marnie
cos we've always had a thing.

20:54.360 --> 20:57.200
But within a second,
guess who else fancies Marnie?

20:57.280 --> 20:59.360
All I'm gonna say is snap.

20:59.440 --> 21:02.920
What a bloody liar. Scott told me
earlier he didn't fancy Marnie.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.080
He didn't even say he fancied me.

21:05.160 --> 21:07.520
I feel like I've been punched
in the ovary.

21:11.640 --> 21:13.680
Kyle looks like
he just chewed a fart.

21:13.760 --> 21:16.360
I wouldn't wanna play that game
with my ex either.

21:17.920 --> 21:20.320
Hols, who do you fancy?
I'm all right.

21:21.160 --> 21:24.800
I'd rather swim with sharks than
be sat round this table right now.

21:24.880 --> 21:26.240
(Nathan) Gary?

21:30.000 --> 21:31.480
(clears throat)

21:40.520 --> 21:41.680
Fair enough.

21:41.760 --> 21:46.480
What the hell? On the outside
I'm cool, I'm calm, I'm collected,

21:46.560 --> 21:49.880
but on the inside
I am having a party.

21:49.960 --> 21:52.240
Whoop, whoop! Yeah, you did!

21:53.160 --> 21:55.480
She's already red, it's fine.
(laughter)

21:55.560 --> 21:58.600
It's such a big deal that
Gary has just said he fancies us

21:58.680 --> 22:00.000
in front of everyone.

22:00.080 --> 22:03.880
With our history,
I'd be pretty gutted if he didn't.

22:03.960 --> 22:07.360
And no matter how many boyfriends
or girlfriends we'll get,

22:07.440 --> 22:09.360
it's always gonna be there.

22:12.760 --> 22:14.280
(Holly)Goodnight, lads.

22:14.360 --> 22:17.440
Night, ladies.
See you in the morning.

22:17.520 --> 22:19.960
'Tonight's been wicked,
but poor Chloe.'

22:20.040 --> 22:23.400
Scott, like the twat he is,
mugged her off in front of everyone.

22:23.480 --> 22:25.400
He knows how much she fancies him.

22:25.480 --> 22:27.120
(Chloe screams)

22:27.200 --> 22:28.960
Like literally, argh!

22:30.880 --> 22:34.440
I can't be in this house...
I don't wanna be in this house.

22:34.520 --> 22:38.520
Scott's really upset us. I like him
and he clearly doesn't like me.

22:38.600 --> 22:40.200
I'm gonna cry myself to sleep.

23:16.080 --> 23:19.200
It's OK if Charlotte wee'd the bed.
I discharge in me dreams.

23:19.280 --> 23:21.560
I feel like
we were talkin' to the lads

23:21.640 --> 23:23.520
a bit more than usual last night.

23:27.520 --> 23:30.240
Last night was fun
and I did manage to have a laugh.

23:30.320 --> 23:32.320
It's a shame that Kyle's still here.

23:32.400 --> 23:36.000
Had better nights.
No one fancies me. This is awkward.

23:36.080 --> 23:39.440
I got really upset because
I realised Scott doesn't like us.

23:39.520 --> 23:41.560
This is definitely a one-way street.

23:41.640 --> 23:44.760
That's clearly a lie cos
he's went there with ya a few times.

23:44.840 --> 23:46.920
If it makes ya feel any better,
Chloe,

23:47.000 --> 23:49.240
I've fancied ya
a lot of times in Greece

23:49.320 --> 23:51.520
and I'm much better lookin'
than Scott.

23:53.800 --> 23:56.760
Hi!
Morning, princess.

23:56.840 --> 23:59.040
This is our first time
waking up in Ios

23:59.120 --> 24:02.840
and the boys and girls are gettin'
on and things are lookin' up,

24:02.920 --> 24:04.520
unless your name is Kyle.

24:04.600 --> 24:08.880
The girls are slowly comin' round.
Holly's not budging on jack shit.

24:08.960 --> 24:12.200
Eventually, hopefully,
she'll start talkin' to me again

24:12.280 --> 24:15.520
and we can build a friendship.
That won't be any time soon.

24:15.600 --> 24:19.640
Kyle, you and Holly are not gonna
be friends for a very long time,

24:19.720 --> 24:21.640
so get that in your fuckin' head.

24:21.720 --> 24:23.560
Hopefully it will be one day,

24:23.640 --> 24:25.920
cos I can't not speak to her
the whole time.

24:26.000 --> 24:27.840
It's awkward. It's shit.

24:27.920 --> 24:30.800
I honestly don't think
I'm livin' in cloud cuckoo land

24:30.880 --> 24:33.520
when I think that me and Holly
will be mates again

24:33.600 --> 24:34.920
cos we've always got on.

24:35.000 --> 24:38.600
Before we had a relationship, she
was my best friend in this house.

24:46.400 --> 24:49.120
I'm so hung-over.
Same.

24:49.200 --> 24:52.640
I want a good kebab.
I've never seen one kebab shop.

24:52.720 --> 24:56.480
One thing Geordies have in common
with the Greeks, a love of kebabs.

24:56.560 --> 24:58.880
We haven't had one since we got here.

24:58.960 --> 25:01.400
Captain Zachary,
do you know a kebab?

25:01.480 --> 25:05.800
In Santorini, they make
the most delicious kebab

25:05.880 --> 25:09.240
in the whole of Greece.
(gasps)

25:09.320 --> 25:12.360
You found it.Go.
To the kebab.

25:12.440 --> 25:14.640
Stop tuggin' and let's get chuggin'.

25:14.720 --> 25:16.400
Kebabs!
Let's go.

25:16.480 --> 25:18.640
Let's go. Santorini.
Kebab!

25:22.320 --> 25:27.840
Santorini, here we come!

25:31.320 --> 25:35.040
We're goin' to Santorini
to find a kebab!

25:35.120 --> 25:38.120
Fuck off.
I swear to God.

25:42.360 --> 25:44.760
When I say "ke" you say "bab." Ke!
(all) Bab!

25:44.840 --> 25:46.000
Ke!
(all) Bab!

25:46.080 --> 25:47.800
Ke!
(all) Bab!

25:56.880 --> 26:00.560
I know it's a bit extravagant
to go to another island for a kebab,

26:00.640 --> 26:06.000
but this apparently
is the best kebab in the world.

26:06.080 --> 26:09.240
So no distance can keep me apart.

26:11.640 --> 26:13.520
We love the fuckin' fish. Yessa!

26:13.600 --> 26:16.880
No, we love the kebab. (laughs)

26:17.720 --> 26:19.480
We are near kebab!

26:23.960 --> 26:27.360
Here I'm sick me like.
We must nearly be here now, yous.

26:27.440 --> 26:29.040
This is a bit ridiculous.

26:29.120 --> 26:32.680
'We have been walking
for fucking miles.'

26:32.760 --> 26:38.000
'I am that hungry that even Scott
is startin' to look like a kebab.'

26:43.600 --> 26:45.920
'Recently I've noticed
Kyle is changing.'

26:46.000 --> 26:49.400
He's isolated himself and I wanna
know what the fuck's goin' on.

26:50.960 --> 26:53.240
It's just fuckin' awkward, innit?

26:53.320 --> 26:55.560
I've been in this place
with Charlotte,

26:55.640 --> 26:59.360
so don't ever think that
it's impossible. It will get better.

26:59.440 --> 27:03.040
I appreciate Gary's there for us.
He's been like a big brother.

27:03.120 --> 27:06.840
Everything he went through with
Charlotte gives him the experience.

27:06.920 --> 27:10.520
You gotta be strong for a few days.
Yeah, yeah. I can be strong.

27:12.040 --> 27:13.360
I stick by what I've done.

27:13.440 --> 27:17.160
She might think that it was a bad
thing, but she's never been happier.

27:17.240 --> 27:20.280
She seems all, "this is amazin',
everything's class."

27:20.360 --> 27:22.000
"I'm having such a good time."

27:22.080 --> 27:25.720
Kyle, I've been there for you the
whole time and I've got your back,

27:25.800 --> 27:29.240
but this is startin' to get boring.
You shouldn't give a fuck.

27:29.320 --> 27:31.080
This is what you wanted.

27:33.840 --> 27:35.880
Oh.
Right, this is a hike this.

27:35.960 --> 27:37.720
Treacherous.
Oh.

27:37.800 --> 27:41.240
I am so tired. Me feet
are killin' off me trainers.

27:41.320 --> 27:43.880
We have walked all of Greece today.

27:43.960 --> 27:48.640
Just when I think we can't walk any
longer and kebab odyssey is dead...

27:49.720 --> 27:52.480
...is it a mirage?

27:52.560 --> 27:55.160
Hallelujah! It's a donkey!

27:55.240 --> 27:57.600
Ask the man, Scott.
Can we get a lift?

27:57.680 --> 27:58.960
On donkey?
Yeah.

27:59.040 --> 28:03.120
Oi, oi, it's a donkey. It's on
like me fuckin' nana's scone.

28:03.200 --> 28:04.760
Up.

28:04.840 --> 28:06.760
My donkey's unreal.

28:06.840 --> 28:09.880
Oi, oi! Donkey,
how're you fuckin' feelin'? Whoo!

28:09.960 --> 28:12.720
I hope this donkey's
used to carrying a lot of weight

28:12.800 --> 28:15.200
cos man's is packin'
bear loads in his pants.

28:15.280 --> 28:18.880
We would like to find
the kebab shop. OK.

28:18.960 --> 28:20.040
Whoa!

28:20.120 --> 28:22.280
You have to be fuckin' kiddin' me.

28:22.360 --> 28:24.800
I do not like my donkey
one fuckin' bit.

28:24.880 --> 28:27.200
It stinks and it keeps
lookin' at me funny.

28:27.280 --> 28:31.080
Ooh! I feel like I'm gonna have
an orgasm on my saddle.

28:31.160 --> 28:32.520
Donkey bum.

28:32.600 --> 28:35.800
Just when I think me vagina
has been permanently damaged

28:35.880 --> 28:39.680
off riding this fucking donkey,
there's a cafe!

28:39.760 --> 28:42.920
I think this is it.
This has gotta be the shop.

28:43.000 --> 28:45.800
(coughs) Hi.

28:45.880 --> 28:48.720
Do you have kebabs here?
(woman)Yes, of course.

28:48.800 --> 28:50.640
(sighs)
Yes!

28:50.720 --> 28:55.120
I am fuckin' buzzin'. Let's try
the best kebab on this earth.

28:55.200 --> 28:58.200
These better be the best kebabs
I've ever tasted

28:58.280 --> 29:00.200
cos this has been a fuckin' mission.

29:00.280 --> 29:02.160
Yes!

29:02.240 --> 29:04.080
The kebabs of Greece.

29:04.160 --> 29:06.000
The shrine!

29:06.080 --> 29:11.360
I am expecting big, tasty,
juicy things from this bad boy.

29:11.440 --> 29:12.920
Right.

29:18.800 --> 29:22.280
Urgh! I feel like the donkey
just cummed in me mouth.

29:22.360 --> 29:23.920
All that white stuff in it.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.880
This is definitely
one of those occasions

29:26.960 --> 29:29.600
where it's better to spit
and not swallow.

29:29.680 --> 29:32.240
Nah, I'm not keen on that, are you?
Nah.

29:32.320 --> 29:33.720
Apart from the hair.

29:33.800 --> 29:37.200
Are you kiddin' me? Worst thing
I've ever tasted in my life.

29:37.280 --> 29:38.440
Try that.

29:40.040 --> 29:42.560
Those kebabs
look absolutely liftin'.

29:42.640 --> 29:45.320
It looks like a donkey
had a shit in a pitta bread.

29:45.400 --> 29:47.240
I'm sorry for bringin' yous.

29:47.320 --> 29:50.720
Kebabs in Newcastle
are so much better.So much better.

29:50.800 --> 29:54.160
The best kebab shop belongs
on the Bigg Market in Newcastle.

29:54.240 --> 29:57.640
Not at the top of this
fuckin' stupid hill in Greece.

29:57.720 --> 29:59.040
Fuck that.

29:59.120 --> 30:02.520
I'm going back to the boat
to wash this donkey stink off us.

30:08.520 --> 30:09.880
Santorini looks lush.

30:09.960 --> 30:12.920
I can't wait for tonight,
get absolutely smashed.

30:13.000 --> 30:14.640
This is the first proper night

30:14.720 --> 30:17.240
since Kyle brought two girls
back to the house.

30:17.320 --> 30:20.240
I don't know how it's gonna go,
but I need to stay strong.

30:20.320 --> 30:21.920
Where the hell are they at?

30:22.000 --> 30:25.480
I have no idea. They went to get
kebabs literally seven hours ago.

30:25.560 --> 30:28.160
We'll to go out without them
and meet them there.

30:29.080 --> 30:30.120
Hiya.
Hello.

30:30.160 --> 30:31.680
Are we gonna go without them?

30:31.760 --> 30:34.240
We're gonna have to.
Come on then, let's go.

30:34.320 --> 30:36.800
'Great. Fuck them.
Let's get fuckin' out.'

30:36.880 --> 30:39.040
Santorini, I hope you are ready.

30:47.560 --> 30:51.440
I am determined to have fun tonight,
so it's time for a daiquiri.

30:51.520 --> 30:53.600
I'm gettin' daiquiri drunk.

30:54.680 --> 30:58.440
How nice has it been without Scott?
He's doing my fuckin' head in.

30:58.520 --> 31:00.520
(laughter)

31:00.600 --> 31:04.040
But he gives Chloe butterflies.
I wouldn't go that far like.

31:04.120 --> 31:07.640
For fuck's sake, I didn't want
everyone to know that I liked him.

31:07.720 --> 31:10.640
Yes, right, right, right, right!
(laughter)

31:10.720 --> 31:12.360
To being Scott free!

31:12.440 --> 31:14.720
I'm sat here
and I'm lookin' at the view

31:14.800 --> 31:16.960
and this is such a romantic place.

31:17.040 --> 31:19.160
If only I had someone
to share it with.

31:19.240 --> 31:21.000
Oh, wait, I do. My ex boyfriend.

31:21.080 --> 31:24.960
And I've got to stand facin' him
every single night and cheers him

31:25.040 --> 31:26.560
and it's fucking difficult.

31:27.680 --> 31:29.520
(cheering)

31:29.600 --> 31:31.640
(Chloe)Hiya!
Hiker!

31:31.720 --> 31:33.080
About time you got here.

31:33.160 --> 31:35.960
We rock up to the bar,
and I can't wait to have a drink

31:36.040 --> 31:38.760
and wash the taste of that shit kebab
out my mouth.

31:38.840 --> 31:39.960
(all) Cheers.

31:43.480 --> 31:45.200
(laughter)

31:46.120 --> 31:47.760
I still haven't got a kebab.

31:47.840 --> 31:49.760
You're lookin' handsome tonight.

31:49.840 --> 31:52.880
Scott's sat next to us
and my butterflies are kicking off.

31:52.960 --> 31:57.080
There's a thunderstorm erupting in
me stomach, but I'm playin' it cool.

31:57.160 --> 31:58.920
Just wanna have a fuckin' frisk.

31:59.000 --> 32:02.440
What about pulling
inside the family then? (laughs)

32:02.520 --> 32:04.280
Got a bit embarrassed there.

32:04.360 --> 32:07.800
I love her when she's like this.
Me and her get on proper sound.

32:07.880 --> 32:11.520
Howay, if I get with you, you can't
hack it if I get with other girls.

32:11.600 --> 32:13.080
You switch like that, you.

32:13.160 --> 32:17.920
You just turn from like from being
sound to an absolute 'mare. So...

32:18.000 --> 32:19.720
It's sexy though.
It's not.

32:19.800 --> 32:22.280
It is.
Not when I'm fearin' for me life.

32:22.360 --> 32:24.280
(laughs) You're scared of us.

32:24.360 --> 32:26.680
We get on well
so it's like just laughable.

32:26.760 --> 32:28.280
We'll see, we'll see.

32:28.360 --> 32:30.480
I wouldn't flatter yourself
that much.

32:30.560 --> 32:31.960
Of course I'd bang Scott.

32:32.040 --> 32:34.960
If he tried it on with us,
I wouldn't be able to resist.

32:35.040 --> 32:37.240
It's what happens
when you like someone.

32:37.320 --> 32:39.120
Do you wanna breadstick though?

32:39.200 --> 32:42.920
On the good side, this breadstick
looks like a... a bird thing.

32:43.000 --> 32:46.480
I'm tryin' to be sexy with a
breadstick, but it's not workin'.

32:46.560 --> 32:48.680
This is your chopper later.

32:48.760 --> 32:50.200
(laughs)

32:50.280 --> 32:52.080
I'm just gonna leave it now.

32:52.160 --> 32:53.960
(laughs)

32:56.280 --> 32:57.400
(all) Cheers.

32:59.680 --> 33:01.440
'I'm havin' such a good night.'

33:01.520 --> 33:04.560
I'm buzzin' that we're all together
and we're gettin' on.

33:04.640 --> 33:05.960
Come on, party crew!

33:06.040 --> 33:10.440
I just can't wait to get to the club,
get smashed and carry on this party.

33:12.880 --> 33:14.280
Whoa!

33:16.840 --> 33:19.200
'We get to the club
and it's amazing.'

33:19.280 --> 33:22.280
I really wanna get mortal
to take me mind off me and Kyle,

33:22.360 --> 33:24.600
and this is the perfect place
to do it.

33:24.680 --> 33:26.000
Whoo!

33:32.960 --> 33:36.000
'It's been a while since
I've seen everybody dancin',

33:36.080 --> 33:37.760
everyone having a good time.'

33:37.840 --> 33:40.080
This is what our nights out
should be like.

33:58.160 --> 34:02.600
It's just like the old days. We are
a fully conjoined family again.

34:08.720 --> 34:10.120
I am so drunk right now.

34:10.200 --> 34:12.800
'I'm really trying to pretend
that I don't care,

34:12.880 --> 34:16.040
but I'm so drunk and it's
still so difficult around Kyle.'

34:28.800 --> 34:31.200
Although I'm tryin'
to play it really cool,

34:31.280 --> 34:34.600
I'm excited to see if anything
happens between me and Scott.

34:34.680 --> 34:37.400
He was so flirty earlier
and didn't exactly say no.

34:46.160 --> 34:48.600
I know I'm probably
gonna get hurt by Scott,

34:48.680 --> 34:51.160
but I like takin' a risk
and he's worth it.

35:04.080 --> 35:07.840
I don't know what it is, but
every time I seem to have a drink,

35:07.920 --> 35:09.520
I can't stay away from Kyle.

35:09.640 --> 35:12.800
'I'm puttin' on a brave face
but I'm feelin' so angry.'

35:12.880 --> 35:16.400
He's a fuckin' dick. All I wanna do
is to let him know that.

35:25.640 --> 35:27.680
Everyone's havin' a pure cush night,

35:27.760 --> 35:30.400
and then Holly and Kyle
start kickin' off again.

35:30.480 --> 35:33.480
Is this a joke? What more
do they have to argue about?

35:33.560 --> 35:36.760
Surely they've covered
all bases of arguin'.

35:44.880 --> 35:46.960
Happy? I am not fucking happy,

35:47.040 --> 35:50.000
and right now, it is hurting
and I'm putting on a front

35:50.080 --> 35:52.720
because I'm trying to hide
exactly how I feel.

35:52.800 --> 35:54.240
Well, I'm not any more.

36:07.320 --> 36:10.640
I'm not havin' this like.
She can fuck off.

36:10.720 --> 36:13.040
Don't you fuckin' dare
try to walk away.

36:21.600 --> 36:23.360
Charlotte, fuck off.

36:35.600 --> 36:39.000
Even when Charlotte, Holly's
best friend, tries to break it up,

36:39.080 --> 36:41.040
Holly screams in Charlotte's face.

36:41.120 --> 36:44.200
Them two are a lost cause.
Everybody's giving up on them.

36:51.360 --> 36:55.080
We've tried to be there for Holly
and Kyle and it divided our family.

36:55.160 --> 36:57.360
If they want to fling it
back in our faces

36:57.440 --> 37:00.680
when we've just got things
back on track, they can fuck off.

37:00.760 --> 37:03.120
Why do these two
always have to kill the mood?

37:03.200 --> 37:05.360
Especially now
we're all talkin' again.

37:05.440 --> 37:07.360
This is about Holly and Kyle.

37:07.440 --> 37:09.880
The rest of us
shouldn't have been divided.

37:17.360 --> 37:20.080
I'm fuckin' bored to death
of this now.

37:20.160 --> 37:22.240
It's just a background noise.

37:32.680 --> 37:35.400
We're used to Holly and Kyle
arguing every night,

37:35.480 --> 37:38.520
but tonight it's not
the boys V the girls,

37:38.600 --> 37:40.600
it's Holly and Kyle versus us.

37:52.480 --> 37:55.120
I don't know where
all this anger has come from,

37:55.200 --> 37:57.040
but I'm just pickin' a fight

37:57.120 --> 37:59.880
because it is the only way
I can get to speak to him.

37:59.960 --> 38:02.960
(sad music playing)

38:20.320 --> 38:23.080
I know we've done the right thing
by breaking up,

38:23.160 --> 38:26.120
but it still hurts me
just as much as it hurts her.

38:32.040 --> 38:35.240
All I want him to do is to say
he's made one massive mistake,

38:35.320 --> 38:37.040
but that day's never gonna come

38:37.120 --> 38:40.920
and I've still got to face him every
single day and look him in the eye

38:41.000 --> 38:44.080
and pretend that I'm happier
without him when I'm not.

38:49.840 --> 38:53.280
Another amazing night ruined
by a Holly and Kyle argument.

38:53.360 --> 38:55.760
'Let's get back
to that fuckin' boat.'

38:57.480 --> 38:58.560
Fuckin' hell!

39:00.360 --> 39:01.760
Jump!

39:10.280 --> 39:12.840
I can't believe
tonight has gone so wrong

39:12.920 --> 39:16.120
to the point of where
I don't even wanna speak to anybody.

39:16.200 --> 39:17.800
I just wanna go to bed.

39:19.800 --> 39:24.520
After tonight's drama, I'm exhausted.
I'm goin' to sleep.

39:30.520 --> 39:34.440
I don't wanna wake up in the morning
to hear Holly moanin' about Kyle,

39:34.520 --> 39:38.160
so me and Chloe are gonna find
somewhere else to sleep.

39:38.240 --> 39:39.640
I wonder where Gary is?

39:41.280 --> 39:43.880
I'm lyin' in bed
and I'm nearly asleep...

39:44.920 --> 39:48.280
...and all of a sudden,
Charlotte and Chloe come in the room

39:48.360 --> 39:50.720
very drunk and acting very weird.

39:51.960 --> 39:54.800
Operation: Get A Bed
is going into action.

39:54.880 --> 39:56.200
Oh, there's a willy.

39:56.280 --> 39:59.560
I've never seen it before, Gary,
but I bet it's quite big.

39:59.640 --> 40:01.680
Gary, show Chloe.
Can I see it?

40:01.760 --> 40:04.000
Me and Chloe are gonna neck on.
Yeah.

40:04.080 --> 40:05.800
(both) One, two, three.

40:05.880 --> 40:09.520
Charlotte and Chloe are asking to
see me dick. Then they're kissin'.

40:12.360 --> 40:13.720
Stop.

40:13.800 --> 40:16.920
In the past, if two girls
walked in my room and necked on,

40:17.000 --> 40:19.160
I'd be on them
like a tramp on chips.

40:19.240 --> 40:22.560
But now I can't,
this is literally soul destroying.

40:22.640 --> 40:24.080
(groans)

40:24.160 --> 40:25.840
(both laugh)

40:25.920 --> 40:27.760
I deserve a fuckin' medal.

40:27.840 --> 40:30.120
You got your own room...
What about this?

40:30.200 --> 40:31.840
No, man.
Shut up, Gary.

40:31.920 --> 40:33.640
I can't be in a room with you...

40:33.720 --> 40:35.920
Oh, right... Stop it now.

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
Things just go from bad to worse.

40:38.080 --> 40:41.440
Now Charlotte has got her tits out.
Really?

40:41.520 --> 40:42.720
(laughs)

40:42.800 --> 40:45.920
Are yous being...
They're gonna... They're gonna...

40:46.000 --> 40:47.880
What is goin' on?

40:49.320 --> 40:50.960
Stop it!

40:52.320 --> 40:54.520
(indistinct complaining)

40:56.080 --> 40:57.400
Stop it!

40:57.480 --> 41:01.280
I'm gonna be a man about this and
remove myself from the situation.

41:01.360 --> 41:04.160
Walking out of that room
leaving two girls in bed,

41:04.240 --> 41:08.200
I can see the old Gaz
lookin' at me now shaking his head.

41:08.280 --> 41:10.320
But, mate, come on, I'm a new guy.

41:12.720 --> 41:17.000
'Great success. Gary is out of
the shag pad. The plan has worked.'

41:17.080 --> 41:19.800
Me and Charlotte have
a really comfy bed to sleep in.

41:22.400 --> 41:24.000
'Night, Gary.'

41:24.080 --> 41:26.560
(evil laugh)

41:28.480 --> 41:29.960
(groans)

41:56.520 --> 41:56.720
.
