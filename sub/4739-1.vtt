00:13.840 --> 00:18.300
<i>Rendezvous, a little nest for two</i>

00:18.400 --> 00:22.800
<i>Just up the road from True Love Avenue</i>

00:23.320 --> 00:25.720
<i>The skies are blue</i>

00:25.840 --> 00:30.000
<i>And winter daisies bloom
where old plants grew</i>

00:30.120 --> 00:32.439
<i>I'll stay for you</i>

00:32.560 --> 00:37.260
<i>And we will wait to see the sunrise
with a top of hill of gold</i>

00:37.360 --> 00:40.880
<i>And we will kiss beneath the ruby rain...</i>

00:42.360 --> 00:45.260
<i>Oh, we will hear the wind before the call</i>

00:45.360 --> 00:49.180
<i>Catch flying stars before they fall</i>

00:49.280 --> 00:51.380
<i>Someday</i>

00:51.480 --> 00:53.520
<i>When skies are blue</i>

00:53.640 --> 00:58.380
<i>Will you meet me there on True Love Avenue</i>

00:58.480 --> 01:02.900
<i>We will kiss beneath the ruby rain again</i>

01:03.000 --> 01:07.860
<i>And when the wildflower bends, oh,
with the wind</i>

01:07.960 --> 01:12.600
<i>We'll see the red sunrise
on True Love Avenue</i>

01:13.200 --> 01:17.980
<i>Will you meet me there on True Love Avenue</i>

01:18.080 --> 01:22.540
<i>We will kiss beneath the ruby rain again</i>

01:22.640 --> 01:26.480
<i>And when the wildflower bends, oh</i>

01:26.600 --> 01:28.720
<i>With the wind we'll see the red...</i>

01:28.840 --> 01:32.060
...begin today our celebration
of the sacrament of baptism.

01:32.160 --> 01:36.220
We pray for these children,
set them free from original sin

01:36.320 --> 01:38.560
make them a temple of your glory

01:38.680 --> 01:41.180
and send the Holy Spirit
to dwell with them.

01:41.280 --> 01:44.920
We ask this through Christ our Lord. Amen.

01:45.040 --> 01:48.040
- Look at Jenny with that baby.
- Reject sin.

01:48.320 --> 01:51.140
- Don't start, Rose.
- Start what?

01:51.240 --> 01:53.200
You know.

01:54.560 --> 01:57.060
Well, look at her.

01:57.160 --> 02:00.220
And that clock has started ticking.
What's she waiting for?

02:00.320 --> 02:04.020
- A husband.
- I know that, Eddie.

02:04.120 --> 02:06.280
I just don't understand why
she hasn't found anybody yet.

02:06.400 --> 02:10.520
Profess your faith in Jesus Christ.
This is the faith of the church.

02:10.639 --> 02:14.580
This is the faith in which these children
are about to be baptized.

02:14.680 --> 02:17.920
- Do you reject Satan?
- I do.

02:18.040 --> 02:21.300
- And all his empty promises?
- I do.

02:21.400 --> 02:24.240
- And all his works?
- I do.

02:24.520 --> 02:26.200
You have to answer.

02:27.160 --> 02:29.300
What if I don't believe in Satan?

02:29.400 --> 02:33.080
Or that all the works
attributed to him are evil?

02:33.200 --> 02:35.480
Oh, just answer, will you?

02:36.280 --> 02:37.720
I do.

02:38.360 --> 02:41.720
- What was that all about?
- I don't know.

02:42.200 --> 02:44.840
She feels guilty about something.

02:45.200 --> 02:48.000
Guilty? About what?

02:48.120 --> 02:49.780
I don't know.

02:49.880 --> 02:52.520
But she feels guilty.

02:56.640 --> 03:00.440
And the bread's on top of the microwave
and it goes in the blue basket.

03:00.560 --> 03:03.000
I know where the bread goes, Mom.
I used to live here remember?

03:03.120 --> 03:07.460
- And I already put it in the red basket.
- But I always serve it in the blue basket.

03:07.560 --> 03:11.160
- They're exactly the same.
- But... they aren't.

03:11.280 --> 03:13.600
They're two different colors.

03:14.640 --> 03:17.120
Okay, I'll put the bread
in the blue basket.

03:17.240 --> 03:18.700
- Where's Jenny?
- Who knows?

03:18.800 --> 03:21.260
- Mom and I are doing all this ourselves.
- I offered to help.

03:21.360 --> 03:25.040
We don't want your help, it's your day.
And it's almost done anyway.

03:25.720 --> 03:28.380
Hey, where you been?
I got somebody I want you to meet.

03:28.480 --> 03:30.500
I don't have time, I have to
help Mom and Anne with the food.

03:30.600 --> 03:33.360
No, you don't, you can help us clean up.

03:35.120 --> 03:37.720
All you have to do is say hello.

03:47.200 --> 03:50.020
Hey, Tommy, I want you
to meet my sister Jenny.

03:50.120 --> 03:52.160
It's nice to meet you. Your brother's
told me so much about you.

03:52.280 --> 03:54.580
Tommy just transferred here
from our New York office.

03:54.680 --> 03:57.380
New York, that's a big change.
But I'm sure you'll love Cleveland.

03:57.480 --> 04:00.280
It's got a very rich cultural heritage.

04:00.400 --> 04:03.220
I've got to leave but... would it be
alright if I called you sometime?

04:03.320 --> 04:05.760
Yeah. Sure. Sure.

04:07.480 --> 04:10.420
- Yeah, don't bother calling.
- Why not?

04:10.520 --> 04:12.760
She won't call back.

04:14.880 --> 04:17.560
- Strike 43.
- Oh, shut up, Anne.

04:17.680 --> 04:20.260
I don't know why we keep trying.
That guy is cute.

04:20.360 --> 04:23.040
If you keep on being so picky
you're going to end up alone.

04:23.160 --> 04:25.780
You know... did it ever occur
to you that I might actually be

04:25.880 --> 04:28.280
in a relationship with somebody?

04:28.400 --> 04:30.720
No, are you?

04:32.000 --> 04:35.680
It doesn't matter if I am or I'm not.
Why does everybody always assume I'm not?

04:35.800 --> 04:39.040
Because you never bring anybody home
and you never mention it.

04:39.160 --> 04:40.920
The only people we've ever met
are your roommate

04:41.040 --> 04:43.960
and that pack of friends
you do everything with.

04:44.600 --> 04:47.600
If there is somebody,
what's wrong with him?

04:49.000 --> 04:50.760
He's married, isn't he?

04:58.960 --> 05:01.240
- She said it?
- No, but she didn't deny it.

05:01.360 --> 05:03.040
And I could tell from her face.

05:03.160 --> 05:06.020
I just don't believe
she'd do something like that.

05:06.120 --> 05:09.060
I hope he doesn't have kids.
Do you know how long it's been going on?

05:09.160 --> 05:11.800
What are you doing out there, Frankie?

05:13.320 --> 05:16.120
Just making some phone calls.

05:18.520 --> 05:21.660
She's not going to tell me anything.
I have everything she wants.

05:21.760 --> 05:23.320
Two kids and a husband.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.880
I know.

05:27.920 --> 05:31.040
I am not involved with a married man.

05:31.160 --> 05:32.880
Good.

05:33.560 --> 05:36.120
Not that you're going to do
what I say anymore.

05:36.520 --> 05:40.920
At your age what you do
is... is your business.

05:41.280 --> 05:44.120
Like me. Sitting here.

05:44.240 --> 05:47.040
Having a quiet smoke
that nobody needs to know about.

05:47.160 --> 05:49.560
Have I ever told on you?

05:49.720 --> 05:51.480
No.

05:52.960 --> 05:54.300
That Anne has such a big mouth.

05:54.400 --> 05:57.920
If she has to gossip about something
she should at least get her story straight.

05:58.040 --> 05:59.640
You should leave Anne alone.

05:59.760 --> 06:03.360
You don't know what it's like
being married to a guy like Frankie.

06:04.520 --> 06:06.840
I don't know what it's like
to be married at all.

06:06.960 --> 06:10.740
- You sound like that's what you want.
- Doesn't everybody?

06:10.840 --> 06:12.680
I guess.

06:13.320 --> 06:16.320
It's probably why they don't always do it
for the right reasons.

06:16.440 --> 06:18.940
What's the right reasons?
Somebody's got your back?

06:19.040 --> 06:21.280
What are you, a Marine?

06:21.400 --> 06:23.800
No, it's because you...

06:24.600 --> 06:27.000
you meet the right person.

06:27.640 --> 06:31.520
And when you meet the right person,
you... you go the distance.

06:31.640 --> 06:34.120
And let me tell you about the distance.

06:35.560 --> 06:37.760
Everybody changes.

06:38.360 --> 06:42.320
But if you're with the right person
and they change...

06:42.880 --> 06:45.400
you meet the right person all over again.

06:51.480 --> 06:56.480
Well, Anne did get something right.
I am seeing somebody.

06:57.080 --> 06:59.840
Yeah? Who?

07:00.360 --> 07:02.520
Just somebody but...

07:03.000 --> 07:05.080
it is the right person.

07:05.720 --> 07:07.760
So when's the wedding?

07:10.040 --> 07:11.900
I don't know.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.560
And I'm cold. Going in, okay?

07:15.760 --> 07:17.440
Okay.

07:28.480 --> 07:30.780
- Jenny?
- Yeah?

07:30.880 --> 07:33.500
Come here, I wanna talk to you.

07:33.600 --> 07:37.120
Anne got it all wrong. I told her she
didn't know anything about my private life,

07:37.240 --> 07:39.800
not that I was dating a married man.

07:39.920 --> 07:43.140
Oh, well, I'm glad to hear that.

07:43.240 --> 07:46.320
- You believe me just like that?
- Of course I believe you.

07:46.440 --> 07:48.120
You never lie.

07:48.240 --> 07:52.320
You know... it's time for you to start
thinking about what you want.

07:52.440 --> 07:54.340
- What?
- The china or the crystal.

07:54.440 --> 07:57.100
I'm giving the silver
to Michael and Lorraine

07:57.200 --> 08:00.180
so you and Anne have to decide who wants
the china and who wants the crystal.

08:00.280 --> 08:02.100
- You mean when you're dead?
- Yes.

08:02.200 --> 08:04.260
You know I don't wanna have
this conversation, Mom.

08:04.360 --> 08:08.880
Well, maybe not but this isn't something
you can just leave till the last minute.

08:10.480 --> 08:12.920
What are you doing? I'll drop the glasses.

08:13.040 --> 08:15.160
I love you, Mom.

08:15.840 --> 08:17.860
I love you too.

08:17.960 --> 08:21.600
But if you don't let go there won't be
any glasses to give away.

08:23.160 --> 08:25.140
The truth is I'm hoping
you take the crystal.

08:25.240 --> 08:27.000
Why?

08:27.280 --> 08:31.640
Anne's like your father, they're careless.
It'll all be broken in a month.

08:31.760 --> 08:35.679
But you take care of your things.
You're like me.

08:37.919 --> 08:41.240
What makes you think the guy
isn't serious about her?

08:42.520 --> 08:44.580
I don't know. She...

08:44.680 --> 08:47.200
she didn't wanna talk about it.

08:49.400 --> 08:53.040
I'm a fireman, you know, I know men.

08:53.160 --> 08:57.000
I can hear these guys on the phone
stringing these girls along.

08:57.480 --> 09:01.140
I'm telling you, even if she's ready,
this guy hasn't stepped up to the plate

09:01.240 --> 09:03.680
and she doesn't think he's going to.

09:05.560 --> 09:08.160
I wonder why she didn't tell me.

09:09.160 --> 09:12.160
Oh, she didn't really tell me,
it just kind of...

09:12.280 --> 09:15.960
slipped out,
and then she was sorry it did.

09:17.520 --> 09:20.200
She's always been so secretive.

09:20.480 --> 09:22.660
Not when she was little.

09:22.760 --> 09:25.760
She was really open when she was little.

09:27.520 --> 09:30.840
Yeah. She was.

09:31.480 --> 09:33.680
I wonder what happened.

09:35.200 --> 09:36.840
Who knows?

09:55.960 --> 09:59.200
Potato chips?
Bad time at the old homestead?

09:59.320 --> 10:00.440
It was okay.

10:00.560 --> 10:03.260
You didn't have the traditional
fight with your sister?

10:03.360 --> 10:07.240
No, but we came close. She told everyone
I was dating a married man.

10:08.880 --> 10:11.580
And your brother didn't try
to fix you up again?

10:11.680 --> 10:15.520
He did. With a very cute guy this time.

10:17.200 --> 10:18.780
I need to talk to you.

10:18.880 --> 10:21.380
I hope you wanna talk about
getting another roommate in here

10:21.480 --> 10:24.440
because I don't think I can afford
this place much longer if we don't.

10:24.720 --> 10:27.640
No, that's not it.

10:27.760 --> 10:29.920
I've decided...

10:30.320 --> 10:32.760
I want to get married.

10:34.800 --> 10:37.300
And have a family.

10:37.400 --> 10:42.120
I never thought I would hear you say that.

10:45.040 --> 10:46.580
What happened?

10:46.680 --> 10:50.600
I was talking with my dad tonight
and the things he said, it...

10:50.720 --> 10:53.440
it made me realize how much I'm missing.

10:55.000 --> 10:59.000
Did you tell him who you wanna marry?

11:00.240 --> 11:02.040
No.

11:03.200 --> 11:07.960
Well, don't you think you should tell them
you're marrying me before the ceremony?

11:12.280 --> 11:15.520
Marian's daughter is back in rehab.

11:15.640 --> 11:19.740
Son-in-law disappeared
and they have the grandchildren.

11:19.840 --> 11:20.820
Poor Marian.

11:20.920 --> 11:24.120
It's her own fault,
she never put the time in.

11:24.240 --> 11:28.820
- We've been lucky with our kids, Ellen.
- It wasn't luck. It was hard work.

11:28.920 --> 11:30.780
Who else is gonna teach them
right from wrong?

11:30.880 --> 11:32.960
This would look good on Anne.
I'll get two.

11:33.080 --> 11:35.000
How are she and Frankie doing?

11:35.120 --> 11:39.520
Oh, the same, and she has to put up
with that family of his too.

11:39.960 --> 11:42.400
That girl's got her crosses to bear.

11:42.520 --> 11:46.200
- Has Karen found a job?
- Not yet.

11:46.320 --> 11:48.500
It's hard with two kids.

11:48.600 --> 11:50.940
I said I'd take care of them,
but she is a good mother.

11:51.040 --> 11:54.240
- She wants to be with them.
- What about Bobby?

11:54.360 --> 11:56.920
Well, he can't...

11:57.040 --> 12:01.820
take a job while he's trying to raise
money to open his own repair shop.

12:01.920 --> 12:04.100
It takes all his energy.

12:04.200 --> 12:07.800
But at least they are a happy couple
and that's the most important thing.

12:07.920 --> 12:11.360
- How's Jenny?
- Jenny's fine.

12:11.480 --> 12:14.260
And I think she's finally found someone.

12:14.360 --> 12:17.180
- No! Is it serious?
- I think it is.

12:17.280 --> 12:19.680
She said she wants to talk
to us about something.

12:19.800 --> 12:22.040
Then it's serious.

12:22.640 --> 12:24.560
The guy's a bum, that's all I know.

12:24.920 --> 12:27.140
- How do you know that?
- Because we haven't met him.

12:27.240 --> 12:29.620
What kind of guy doesn't want
to meet his girlfriend's family?

12:29.720 --> 12:31.700
- A bum.
- Yeah.

12:31.800 --> 12:33.340
- What's he do?
- I don't know.

12:33.440 --> 12:36.420
She doesn't talk about him.
I don't even know his name.

12:36.520 --> 12:38.900
Anyway she does say she's got
something important to tell us.

12:39.000 --> 12:42.300
Well, it sounds like this is it.
He popped the question.

12:42.400 --> 12:44.980
- Maybe.
- It could be okay, Eddie.

12:45.080 --> 12:47.280
Jenny's a good girl.

12:48.320 --> 12:50.420
You know, you gotta lose some weight.

12:50.520 --> 12:52.800
Why? I don't climb ladders anymore.

12:52.920 --> 12:56.280
- They'll bust you.
- Yeah, well.

12:56.400 --> 12:57.940
You coming over for a drink later?

12:58.040 --> 13:00.560
Ellen and I wouldn't miss
your anniversary party.

13:01.080 --> 13:03.000
Little taste.

13:07.720 --> 13:10.180
More onions. Okay. I'll see ya later.

13:10.280 --> 13:12.000
Alright.

13:14.200 --> 13:19.220
No, I'm not okay. I'm still... carsick.
Once it starts it just doesn't stop.

13:19.320 --> 13:22.720
You're not carsick,
you're just afraid to go in there.

13:23.480 --> 13:25.140
So what if I am?

13:25.240 --> 13:29.120
So you won't be able to do this
if you're going in ashamed of who you are.

13:29.240 --> 13:31.320
I'm not, I'm not ashamed of who I am.

13:31.440 --> 13:34.400
You always say that,
but I'm still kind of confused

13:34.520 --> 13:37.060
as to why you've told everybody
except your family.

13:37.160 --> 13:40.760
Because they... they live in a small
world and they like it in there

13:40.880 --> 13:43.960
and I've just never found
the right time to...

13:44.080 --> 13:46.200
drop the bomb.

13:48.600 --> 13:52.040
You've been lying for a long time.

13:53.320 --> 13:56.040
That's what you're really afraid of.

13:56.480 --> 13:59.920
When you tell them it's gonna change
the way they see you.

14:05.080 --> 14:07.160
- You need to do this on your own.
- What?

14:07.280 --> 14:10.760
It's between you and your parents.
I'll just be in the way.

14:11.120 --> 14:13.800
Just call me when it's done.

14:37.600 --> 14:39.480
- Jenny?
- Yeah. It's me.

14:39.600 --> 14:42.000
Yeah, I know. Where's Kitty?

14:42.440 --> 14:46.420
Oh, she... she had to go
'cause there was...

14:46.520 --> 14:48.600
an emergency at the school. Yeah, I think.

14:48.720 --> 14:50.900
- What kind of emergency?
- A flood.

14:51.000 --> 14:54.100
A flood?
What's she gonna do about a flood?

14:54.200 --> 14:58.520
- I don't know. Happy anniversary.
- Oh, thank you.

14:58.640 --> 14:59.800
- Alright, come on.
- Okay.

14:59.920 --> 15:03.800
- Jenny's here, everybody.
- Finally Jenny's here.

15:03.920 --> 15:06.820
- Jenny.
- Where's Kitty?

15:06.920 --> 15:09.180
She had to take care
of a flood at the school.

15:09.280 --> 15:10.760
What does Kitty know about floods?

15:10.880 --> 15:14.000
Can I talk to you upstairs?
There's something I need to tell you.

15:26.480 --> 15:28.920
Please say something, Jenny.

15:31.960 --> 15:34.020
We thought you were going
to tell us you're getting married.

15:34.120 --> 15:38.020
But it doesn't look like that now.
What happened, honey, did you break up?

15:38.120 --> 15:39.840
No.

15:40.520 --> 15:42.680
Then what is it?

15:44.160 --> 15:47.460
- What do you wanna tell me?
- This isn't gonna be easy for you.

15:47.560 --> 15:50.100
- Are you sick?
- No.

15:50.200 --> 15:53.020
Then what is it, honey?
What could possibly be so hard for me?

15:53.120 --> 15:55.080
I'm gay.

15:56.320 --> 15:57.760
What?

15:59.160 --> 16:01.320
I'm gay, Mom.

16:02.480 --> 16:04.240
You're...

16:07.000 --> 16:08.680
What?

16:08.880 --> 16:11.040
I'm a lesbian.

16:11.600 --> 16:13.100
I'm gay.

16:13.200 --> 16:15.000
But...

16:15.920 --> 16:18.140
But what about the guy?

16:18.240 --> 16:21.400
There is no guy. There's never been a guy.

16:21.520 --> 16:23.440
All these years...

16:23.560 --> 16:26.000
you made them up and I...

16:26.320 --> 16:28.760
I just went along with it.

16:31.160 --> 16:32.700
But...

16:32.800 --> 16:35.480
But I don't... I don't understand.

16:38.800 --> 16:41.260
How long have you known this?

16:41.360 --> 16:43.960
- Always.
- And I missed it?

16:44.080 --> 16:46.140
How did... how could I miss
something like this?

16:46.240 --> 16:49.960
You wanted to. You didn't want
to know and I knew that.

16:50.520 --> 16:54.220
Didn't you ever wonder why you
never met any of these boyfriends?

16:54.320 --> 16:56.480
You always broke up
with them before I could.

16:56.600 --> 16:59.320
No, I didn't. I just...

16:59.440 --> 17:02.200
let you think what you wanted to think.

17:02.320 --> 17:05.500
I thought you were...
you were waiting. I...

17:05.599 --> 17:09.160
- For what?
- I thought...

17:10.839 --> 17:13.339
- What did we do wrong?
- Nothing.

17:13.440 --> 17:18.319
You didn't do anything wrong.
This is just... how I am.

17:18.440 --> 17:22.960
But you're... but you're...
you're like me, you know?

17:23.599 --> 17:27.040
We even like the same things. I always...

17:27.160 --> 17:31.320
- I always thought you were like me.
- That hasn't changed.

17:31.600 --> 17:35.380
I am like you.
I'm still the same person, Mom.

17:35.480 --> 17:37.200
No.

17:37.560 --> 17:39.720
You're not.

17:40.920 --> 17:44.200
You've been lying to me for years.

17:51.520 --> 17:54.260
Your father will have to know
and you should tell him.

17:54.360 --> 17:58.840
I was going to tell you both at the same
time but everybody was staring at me.

18:00.240 --> 18:02.760
He needs to know before...

18:03.240 --> 18:05.640
before I tell everybody else.

18:07.080 --> 18:10.780
- You're telling other people?
- I have to tell Anne and Michael.

18:10.880 --> 18:13.400
I'm going to tell everybody.

18:14.160 --> 18:16.360
Kitty and I wanna get married, Mom.

18:21.480 --> 18:23.700
You're marrying your roommate?

18:23.800 --> 18:26.200
She's not my roommate.

18:26.320 --> 18:29.520
We've been partners
for five years now and...

18:29.840 --> 18:33.080
- we wanna start a family.
- A family?

18:33.200 --> 18:36.720
Yeah. It's what you're always
talking about, isn't it?

18:37.200 --> 18:40.120
And we want a big wedding.
With everybody there.

18:40.240 --> 18:43.700
Friends and family. We want a wedding
like Anne and Michael had.

18:43.800 --> 18:47.800
I want... I want you and Dad
to give me away.

18:50.840 --> 18:53.120
Do what you're gonna do.

18:53.400 --> 18:56.840
But I'm asking you, for my sake...

18:57.120 --> 18:59.280
not to tell everybody else.

18:59.400 --> 19:01.400
Not yet.

19:01.800 --> 19:03.520
Why?

19:04.880 --> 19:07.440
'Cause if you do, nothing
will ever be the same again.

19:07.560 --> 19:10.480
Nothing is the same anymore, Mom.

19:10.600 --> 19:13.940
Maybe not for you but...
but your life isn't here anymore

19:14.040 --> 19:17.740
and if you don't like what happens
you can go away. I can't.

19:17.840 --> 19:20.220
This place, these people...

19:20.320 --> 19:24.200
they're my life and I have to stay here.
I have to live with them.

19:24.560 --> 19:28.820
Oh, I love you, Jenny.
Nothing could ever change that.

19:28.920 --> 19:33.440
But I have a life too and you
can't just change my life on me.

19:39.840 --> 19:42.640
It's not like I'm living
in the past, I'm not.

19:42.760 --> 19:45.780
I know times have changed,
anything goes these days.

19:45.880 --> 19:49.120
I read the papers, I watch TV.

19:50.280 --> 19:55.180
But... but I don't know personally,
anybody in this neighborhood

19:55.280 --> 19:57.560
whose children have...

19:58.400 --> 20:00.200
you know...

20:02.160 --> 20:05.840
- Maybe they all left.
- What?

20:05.960 --> 20:08.240
The neighborhood,
maybe they left the neighborhood.

20:08.360 --> 20:11.020
- I'm sure they did.
- And the lying, all that lying.

20:11.120 --> 20:15.100
Even though I know why you did it,
it's still a hard pill to swallow.

20:15.200 --> 20:18.060
And now a wedding.

20:18.160 --> 20:20.280
Starting a family.

20:20.400 --> 20:22.180
I mean...

20:22.280 --> 20:26.220
we're... we're ordinary people,
not, you know... rebels.

20:26.320 --> 20:28.140
Neither am I.

20:28.240 --> 20:31.640
I just want what you gave
Anne and Michael.

20:33.800 --> 20:36.500
I only did this because of you.

20:36.600 --> 20:37.680
What?

20:37.800 --> 20:42.760
You told me if you meet the right person
you should go the distance, and I did.

20:44.720 --> 20:46.780
I met the right person.

20:46.880 --> 20:48.200
Kitty.

20:49.840 --> 20:52.760
That's why I asked her to marry me
and now you're asking me...

20:52.880 --> 20:55.600
to hide it from my own family.

20:56.840 --> 20:59.500
If you tell them you'll hurt your mother.

20:59.600 --> 21:02.320
If I don't it will hurt me.

21:03.760 --> 21:06.040
What would you do?

21:08.080 --> 21:09.880
I don't know.

21:30.160 --> 21:32.320
Will someone please tell me
what's going on here?

21:33.360 --> 21:36.480
- You really wanna know?
- Why else would I ask?

21:41.360 --> 21:43.840
The married man and I broke up.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.440
I knew I was right about that.

21:49.520 --> 21:51.280
How come?

21:51.960 --> 21:55.480
He decided to stay with his wife.

21:55.760 --> 21:58.140
Well, I'm sorry, Jens. But...

21:58.240 --> 22:01.560
he sounds like a bastard to me.
I think you dodged a bullet.

22:02.160 --> 22:05.620
You don't wanna spend the rest
of your life living with a liar, do you?

22:05.720 --> 22:07.660
No.

22:07.760 --> 22:10.200
But sometimes you have to.

22:10.320 --> 22:14.400
- I'll fill the water glasses.
- I knew I was right about the married man.

22:33.760 --> 22:35.320
Well?

22:35.760 --> 22:38.160
- You did it.
- I did it.

22:38.280 --> 22:41.100
- Are you... okay?
- Yeah.

22:41.200 --> 22:45.020
Even though I lied to my sister. I am.

22:45.120 --> 22:46.880
Thanks.

22:47.080 --> 22:49.800
Telling my parents feels like...

22:50.120 --> 22:52.600
being let out of prison.

22:55.320 --> 22:56.900
Look...

22:57.000 --> 23:01.680
if you've changed your mind
about getting married...

23:01.960 --> 23:04.080
I'm okay with that.

23:04.720 --> 23:07.720
Why would I change my mind
about getting married?

23:08.720 --> 23:12.500
Your family. I know how important
they are to you.

23:12.600 --> 23:16.380
No. My family is not marrying you, I am.

23:16.480 --> 23:18.060
And I have never been more certain

23:18.160 --> 23:21.760
about anything in my entire life
than I am about marrying you.

23:34.960 --> 23:37.360
I wonder who proposed.

23:38.200 --> 23:40.160
She did.

23:40.880 --> 23:42.800
She did.

23:43.800 --> 23:47.920
She said... "Kitty, will you marry me?"

23:49.480 --> 23:51.920
"Kitty, let's start a family."

23:53.920 --> 23:57.280
All these years living a secret life.

24:01.680 --> 24:03.740
I thought I knew her.

24:03.840 --> 24:06.640
Then I find out I don't know her at all.

24:08.720 --> 24:10.480
She's...

24:10.920 --> 24:14.420
She's the same person. She just
left a few things out, that's all.

24:14.520 --> 24:19.360
Eddie, what she left out is who she is.
Being private isn't the same as lying.

24:19.840 --> 24:24.280
Well, you just asked her to keep on lying
so let's stop talking about the lying part.

24:24.400 --> 24:27.960
I never asked her to lie. All I did
was ask her not to tell everybody.

24:28.080 --> 24:30.480
She didn't have to lie to Anne.

24:30.960 --> 24:33.280
And now that she's ready to tell
the whole world the truth,

24:33.400 --> 24:36.380
we're just supposed to go along with it.

24:36.480 --> 24:38.220
You remember our daughter
Jenny, don't you?

24:38.320 --> 24:40.340
Guess what,
she's a completely different person.

24:40.440 --> 24:42.520
Yeah, well, let's just drop it, okay,

24:42.640 --> 24:46.480
because you know, she's doing what
you wanted her to do and that's that.

24:50.640 --> 24:53.520
We have a life too, don't we?

24:53.640 --> 24:55.020
Yes.

24:55.120 --> 24:57.880
This isn't just about her.

24:58.000 --> 24:59.760
No.

25:02.520 --> 25:05.080
What do you think I should have done?

25:06.440 --> 25:09.960
All you can do... is what you do.

25:11.400 --> 25:13.040
What?

25:13.160 --> 25:16.180
All you can do... is what you do.

25:16.280 --> 25:18.200
What does that mean?

25:18.320 --> 25:21.040
It means what it means.

25:31.400 --> 25:33.080
Hello?

25:33.200 --> 25:36.820
- <i>Hi, Mom. It's me.</i>
- Jenny. How are you?

25:36.920 --> 25:40.240
- I'm good, how are you?
- I'm fine.

25:44.240 --> 25:48.240
- How are things?
- Great. Things are great.

25:48.360 --> 25:50.840
How are things with you?

25:50.960 --> 25:53.760
Things are great.

25:55.760 --> 25:57.320
Well...

25:57.440 --> 26:00.300
I... I better go.

26:00.400 --> 26:03.800
Okay, dear. Have a nice day.

26:04.880 --> 26:07.100
You have a nice day too.

26:07.200 --> 26:08.720
I love you.

26:09.680 --> 26:11.720
Love you too.

26:33.680 --> 26:35.960
Why are we doing this? I'm freezing.

26:36.080 --> 26:40.720
- It was your idea to get more exercise.
- No, it wasn't. It was Jenny's.

26:40.840 --> 26:42.880
Okay, I'm done.

26:43.920 --> 26:47.800
- How is Jenny by the way?
- Jenny... Jenny's fine.

26:49.320 --> 26:52.620
She looked strange
at your anniversary party.

26:52.720 --> 26:55.540
- Did she?
- Unhappy.

26:55.640 --> 26:57.600
I didn't see it.

27:00.120 --> 27:03.280
Anne told Karen about the married man.

27:03.480 --> 27:04.840
Anne has a big mouth.

27:04.960 --> 27:09.320
They weren't gossiping.
Our girls are like sisters.

27:10.760 --> 27:13.680
- Did you ever meet him?
- No.

27:13.800 --> 27:16.380
Well, at least it's over.

27:16.480 --> 27:19.040
Anyway, that's what Karen said.

27:20.480 --> 27:23.160
- It is, isn't it?
- What?

27:23.280 --> 27:25.240
Over.

27:25.360 --> 27:27.200
Yes.

27:28.920 --> 27:31.960
Why are you acting so weird?

27:32.080 --> 27:35.120
- How am I acting weird?
- All secretive.

27:35.240 --> 27:38.620
Like, I'm sticking my nose
in your business.

27:38.720 --> 27:42.360
We've been talking to each other
about everything for 45 years

27:42.480 --> 27:47.280
- and Jenny is like one of my own.
- I know that, Ellen. I know.

27:47.400 --> 27:51.160
Then why are you acting
like I'm a busybody?

27:51.280 --> 27:54.000
I'm upset.

27:55.720 --> 27:58.120
About the married man.

27:59.720 --> 28:02.200
It's probably just a phase.

28:03.600 --> 28:06.520
Is it somebody she works with?

28:07.200 --> 28:11.240
- Not her boss?
- No, not her boss. It's another...

28:12.160 --> 28:13.580
Another social worker.

28:13.680 --> 28:17.000
- Any kids?
- No, no kids, let's go.

28:17.440 --> 28:19.720
Well, that's a blessing.

28:20.680 --> 28:23.100
Oh, don't worry too much, Rose.

28:23.200 --> 28:26.560
She's gonna be fine, she's got you.

28:35.760 --> 28:39.200
- Dad. What are you doing here?
- Well, I was in the neighborhood.

28:39.760 --> 28:41.940
You never come over here.

28:42.040 --> 28:45.840
Well, I... I had to buy some equipment.

28:45.960 --> 28:48.020
What kind of equipment
do they sell around here?

28:48.120 --> 28:51.680
Well, you know, just equipment stuff.
It's not worth talking about.

28:51.800 --> 28:53.920
You wanna have some lunch
or is this a bad time for you?

28:54.040 --> 28:56.440
No, I'm starving...

28:56.560 --> 28:59.540
and it is always a bad time around here.

28:59.640 --> 29:02.700
The last stop for kids nobody wants and...

29:02.800 --> 29:07.160
- I'm supposed to find homes for them all.
- Well, you always do.

29:09.200 --> 29:11.960
You have too high an opinion of me, Dad.

29:16.720 --> 29:19.100
Michael's coming around to help
re-build the fence next week.

29:19.200 --> 29:20.460
- Yeah, he mentioned that.
- Yeah.

29:20.560 --> 29:22.620
What about Anne and Frankie,
you seen them?

29:22.720 --> 29:25.040
Not in a couple of weeks.

29:25.400 --> 29:29.580
They're... they're going away next weekend
they asked us to look after the kids.

29:29.680 --> 29:32.460
But we've got the bowling tournament so...

29:32.560 --> 29:35.340
so I guess they'll ask
Michael and Lorraine.

29:35.440 --> 29:37.420
They asked us.

29:37.520 --> 29:41.200
Well... those kids are crazy about you.

29:41.320 --> 29:46.160
No, it's Kitty that they love.
She's really fantastic with kids.

29:48.280 --> 29:52.180
So... it's almost Turkey Day.
Your favorite holiday.

29:52.280 --> 29:55.840
Yeah, I hope I can cook
one as good as Mom does.

29:56.640 --> 29:59.340
Well, you're gonna cook your own?

29:59.440 --> 30:00.600
Yeah.

30:01.840 --> 30:04.400
Yeah, Kitty and I are gonna have
a couple friends over.

30:07.440 --> 30:09.300
So...

30:09.400 --> 30:11.800
what do you want, Jenny?

30:13.280 --> 30:15.520
What do I want?

30:17.240 --> 30:19.240
Don't you know?

30:20.040 --> 30:21.760
Ribs.

30:22.240 --> 30:24.020
- What?
- Yeah. I know how much you love ribs.

30:24.120 --> 30:28.700
I was thinking maybe, you know,
Chinese but if you want ribs...

30:28.800 --> 30:30.740
I'm happy with that.

30:30.840 --> 30:33.460
Yeah, yeah, ribs. Let's do ribs then.

30:33.560 --> 30:35.660
- Okay.
- Okay.

30:35.760 --> 30:37.520
Come on.

30:38.440 --> 30:41.000
She's always been here for Thanksgiving.

30:42.480 --> 30:44.640
Not this year.

30:48.000 --> 30:52.320
I don't get what you mean when you say...
she looks happy.

30:53.200 --> 30:57.960
I mean, she looks happy. What else
does happy mean, it means happy.

30:58.800 --> 31:02.160
How can she be happy
with everything that's going on?

31:07.360 --> 31:09.800
This is bad, Rose.

31:10.120 --> 31:13.920
- What's bad?
- Wanting her to be unhappy.

31:15.480 --> 31:19.340
I don't want her to be unhappy.
Why would I want that?

31:19.440 --> 31:21.720
Because we are.

31:34.680 --> 31:37.440
I couldn't believe that they're screaming,
"My baby, my baby,"

31:37.560 --> 31:40.860
I climb all the way up to the top of
the stairs, and all I find is a dead cat.

31:40.960 --> 31:42.680
- Jesus.
- Who was that?

31:42.800 --> 31:45.240
The two bull dykes on the top floor.

31:45.360 --> 31:47.760
- Don't call them that.
- What?

31:47.880 --> 31:50.240
- Bull dykes, don't call them bull dykes.
- Why not?

31:50.440 --> 31:52.940
Because they're people, that's why.
People like you and me.

31:53.040 --> 31:56.760
Oh, I'm sorry, I should have said
the two bull people on the top floor.

32:00.200 --> 32:04.360
- What's eating him?
- Bobby, just let it go. Eddie.

32:04.920 --> 32:07.040
Eddie, listen.

32:07.640 --> 32:10.440
Ellen told me what Jenny wanted
to talk to you guys about.

32:10.560 --> 32:13.220
- I'm sorry.
- How does Ellen know?

32:13.320 --> 32:15.980
Well, you know...
stuff gets around, but, you know,

32:16.080 --> 32:19.320
I'll be there if you ever want
to punch this asshole's lights out.

32:19.440 --> 32:23.240
- Punch Kitty?
- The married guy's name is Kitty?

32:24.560 --> 32:28.240
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ted... Ted Kitty.

32:36.720 --> 32:39.340
- Mrs. Farrell?
- Oh, my God!

32:39.440 --> 32:42.580
- Barbara Ellen, you scared me!
- I'm so sorry. Do you remember me?

32:42.680 --> 32:45.560
Of course, I remember you.
You went to school with Jenny.

32:45.680 --> 32:48.700
And you didn't scare me,
I was just staring at this dress.

32:48.800 --> 32:51.860
It's beautiful, isn't it?
It's not right on me.

32:51.960 --> 32:54.980
- You're getting married?
- Yeah. I'm meeting my mother inside.

32:55.080 --> 32:58.160
- How's Jenny?
- Jenny is just great.

32:58.280 --> 33:00.700
I haven't seen her since high school.
Is she married?

33:00.800 --> 33:03.980
No. No, she isn't. No.

33:04.080 --> 33:06.940
She's just... completely caught up...

33:07.040 --> 33:10.080
in her career,
she's... she's a social worker.

33:10.480 --> 33:12.600
She handles very disturbed children.

33:12.720 --> 33:15.500
Complicated cases,
the ones no one else can touch.

33:15.600 --> 33:17.180
She's wonderful at it.

33:17.280 --> 33:20.240
- I guess some women are just like that.
- Like what?

33:20.360 --> 33:23.880
More caught up in their work
than their emotions. Born career gals.

33:24.160 --> 33:26.580
I don't... I don't know
what makes you think that...

33:26.680 --> 33:31.000
career gals don't have emotions.
Jenny is picky even about food.

33:31.120 --> 33:33.840
But she has strong emotions
and not throwing herself

33:33.960 --> 33:37.140
at the first person that comes along is
a sign of character. Not a lack of emotion.

33:37.240 --> 33:39.000
- I'm sure.
- The truth is...

33:39.120 --> 33:43.260
Jenny is... is very involved with
a highly respected man in her field

33:43.360 --> 33:45.460
and I wouldn't be surprised
if it led to a wedding.

33:45.560 --> 33:47.640
- So you don't need to worry about Jenny.
- I wasn't.

33:47.760 --> 33:51.220
No, of course not. Why would you be?

33:51.320 --> 33:54.300
You know, my mother's waiting for me
inside Mrs. Farrell, so I better go.

33:54.400 --> 33:57.100
It was very nice to see you,
Barbara Ellen. All the best.

33:57.200 --> 33:59.480
Thank you, Mrs. Farrell.

34:09.719 --> 34:11.460
You're late.

34:11.560 --> 34:13.239
I know.

34:13.679 --> 34:16.020
- You take 90?
- Yeah.

34:16.120 --> 34:19.080
- What time?
- 4:30.

34:19.520 --> 34:22.159
You never take 90 after 4:00,
you know that.

34:22.280 --> 34:25.400
- Always take Carnegie.
- It's longer.

34:25.520 --> 34:29.199
Less traffic.
I always take Carnegie after 4:00.

34:34.639 --> 34:36.659
It's my fault, isn't it?

34:36.760 --> 34:39.080
You're the one who took 90.

34:40.199 --> 34:42.800
I mean Jenny. It's my fault.

34:43.639 --> 34:47.239
I know they say,
it's how you're born now, but...

34:47.639 --> 34:49.880
I don't know, I wonder.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.400
And I was her role model.
I'm what she's rejecting.

34:52.520 --> 34:56.880
Now, don't hog all the glory, Rose.
I'm the man she grew up around.

34:57.000 --> 34:59.800
If she's rejecting anybody, it's me.

35:04.240 --> 35:06.140
I know you.

35:06.240 --> 35:08.200
Excuse me?

35:08.400 --> 35:10.860
I know you, and I know
what you're thinking.

35:10.960 --> 35:14.260
- What's that?
- You're blaming me.

35:14.360 --> 35:16.880
- What for?
- The lying!

35:17.000 --> 35:21.440
I'm not blaming you for lying. I'm...
I'm just doing what you wanna do.

35:21.560 --> 35:24.180
- Why do you keep saying that?
- Because it's true.

35:24.280 --> 35:28.120
Then... then let's do what you wanna do,
Eddie. You never say what you wanna do.

35:28.240 --> 35:30.840
- What do you wanna do?
- I wanna eat my dinner in peace and quiet.

35:30.960 --> 35:33.720
- That's what I wanna do.
- No, it isn't!

35:33.840 --> 35:36.940
You... you... you want me to be
the bad guy, that's what you want.

35:37.040 --> 35:38.420
It's always been that way.

35:38.520 --> 35:41.720
I look like the bad guy when all I'm doing
is exactly what you wanna do,

35:41.840 --> 35:44.520
but I end up getting blamed for it!

35:59.280 --> 36:01.680
I kind of like that it's not white.

36:01.920 --> 36:04.120
Looks like a cantaloupe.

36:05.320 --> 36:07.640
What about that?

36:07.920 --> 36:11.560
Oh, my gosh, that dress
would be perfect on you.

36:17.720 --> 36:21.400
- Jenny!
- I love that. I love it.

36:21.520 --> 36:24.240
All these dresses are so beautiful.

36:24.360 --> 36:26.240
Well, you gotta pick the one
you love the best

36:26.360 --> 36:28.600
because you only get married once.

36:32.680 --> 36:35.600
Oh, my gosh, I love this one.

36:35.720 --> 36:38.440
This is the dress for me. I love this.

36:38.560 --> 36:41.120
I never thought we'd be doing this.

36:41.240 --> 36:42.800
- Did you?
- No.

37:02.600 --> 37:05.100
<i>I may have grown up
in a trailer park, Bryce,</i>

37:05.200 --> 37:09.300
<i>but I'm warning you... if I don't get
Worthing Manor in the divorce</i>

37:09.400 --> 37:12.640
- <i>everyone will know about you.</i>
- Hello?

37:12.880 --> 37:15.040
Anne. What're you doing here?

37:15.160 --> 37:19.020
- Are you busy?
- No, just... ironing.

37:19.120 --> 37:20.880
Camilla told Bryce...

37:21.000 --> 37:24.920
if she doesn't get Worthington Manor in the
divorce settlement, she'll expose his past.

37:25.040 --> 37:28.480
- I saw Jenny this morning.
- Oh, yeah. Where?

37:28.600 --> 37:31.960
- Nordstrom.
- Oh, was there a sale?

37:32.080 --> 37:34.880
No. Something happened.

37:35.720 --> 37:38.380
I don't know if I should tell you...

37:38.480 --> 37:40.240
but...

37:41.000 --> 37:45.280
I figured somebody else will sooner or
later so it's better if it comes from me.

37:47.040 --> 37:50.120
She was outside
the bridal suite with Kitty.

37:50.600 --> 37:52.780
They're a couple, Mom.

37:52.880 --> 37:55.960
They were kissing each other in public.

38:00.440 --> 38:02.940
I should've gone up to them, but I...

38:03.040 --> 38:06.580
was so blown away, I couldn't and then
I didn't know what to do. If I should...

38:06.680 --> 38:08.180
if I should tell you or not tell you.

38:08.280 --> 38:12.120
And then I thought, well, you should
know before anybody else does.

38:12.240 --> 38:15.200
How could we have missed it
all these years?

38:15.760 --> 38:19.840
No boyfriends, hanging out
with all those girls all the time.

38:20.680 --> 38:24.320
And it looked like they were
picking out wedding dresses, Mom.

38:25.040 --> 38:27.280
Wedding dresses!

38:27.600 --> 38:29.880
They probably were.

38:30.480 --> 38:32.720
They're getting married.

38:32.840 --> 38:34.480
What?

38:36.880 --> 38:39.040
They're getting married.

38:39.720 --> 38:41.900
- You knew about them?
- Yeah.

38:42.000 --> 38:45.480
- Since when?
- Since...

38:46.360 --> 38:48.760
our anniversary party.

38:49.680 --> 38:53.020
So all that stuff about the married man
was a pack of lies?

38:53.120 --> 38:54.920
It...

38:56.440 --> 38:58.760
It wasn't the truth.

38:59.760 --> 39:03.180
- You two and your conspiracies.
- Conspiracies?

39:03.280 --> 39:05.680
When we were growing up,
you and little miss perfect

39:05.800 --> 39:10.380
belonged to a club I couldn't join.
It didn't bother Michael, he was the boy.

39:10.480 --> 39:12.980
But I was the outsider and I still am.

39:13.080 --> 39:15.580
You were never the outsider
even when you wanted to be.

39:15.680 --> 39:17.720
- Wanted to be!
- You were always testing us.

39:17.840 --> 39:20.640
Breaking the rules to see
what would happen. Jenny was easy.

39:20.760 --> 39:23.740
You have never loved me
as much as you love Jenny!

39:23.840 --> 39:25.880
That is not true!

39:26.000 --> 39:28.980
- Oh, I love all my children the same.
- No, you don't!

39:29.080 --> 39:32.540
God, if you did
you wouldn't have lied to me.

39:32.640 --> 39:34.480
You made a fool out me!

39:34.600 --> 39:37.240
Letting me go on and on
about all that married man bullshit

39:37.360 --> 39:39.440
just to keep your secrets!

39:39.560 --> 39:41.900
As usual, the two of you against me.

39:42.000 --> 39:44.480
What kind of love is that?

40:03.240 --> 40:06.100
Mom. Whatever you've got
to tell me you gotta tell me fast.

40:06.200 --> 40:08.340
I've gotta be in court in an hour,
and you wouldn't believe it.

40:08.440 --> 40:11.400
This couple left their 5-year-old
son locked in their apartment

40:11.520 --> 40:13.420
while they went on vacation,
and now of course they...

40:13.520 --> 40:15.620
- Anne knows.
- Knows what?

40:15.720 --> 40:18.840
About you and Kitty.
She saw you this morning at Nordstrom.

40:18.960 --> 40:23.600
She's... she's very angry
about being lied to.

40:25.560 --> 40:28.060
I know I got it wrong, I know.

40:28.160 --> 40:31.900
But... ever since
you were a little girl...

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
I've thought about your wedding.

40:34.120 --> 40:38.440
I imagined helping you pick out
your silver and flatware, your china

40:38.560 --> 40:40.620
and helping you pick out your dress.

40:40.720 --> 40:42.620
Now, I don't even know
if you'll wear a dress.

40:42.720 --> 40:46.460
Maybe you'll wear a suit or maybe you'll
wear a dress and Kitty will wear a suit...

40:46.560 --> 40:49.360
- We're both wearing dresses.
- And where will you get married?

40:49.480 --> 40:53.660
- Not in the church, it won't allow it.
- That doesn't mean God won't allow it.

40:53.760 --> 40:55.880
The thing is...

40:56.240 --> 41:00.120
I'm not good at making things up.

41:00.240 --> 41:02.680
When I cook I use a cookbook.

41:02.800 --> 41:05.020
And the way you dance,
I don't like dancing like that.

41:05.120 --> 41:09.200
I like steps. I like...
I like dances with steps.

41:09.320 --> 41:11.940
- Like, that one, you know that one...
- The conga line?

41:12.040 --> 41:14.700
- Yeah.
- It doesn't have steps.

41:14.800 --> 41:18.460
Well, but I always do the same ones.

41:18.560 --> 41:20.620
I love the conga line.

41:20.720 --> 41:24.620
I know the steps to that one
but I don't know the steps to this one.

41:24.720 --> 41:28.240
And you think I do? Really?

41:28.360 --> 41:30.960
I don't like making it up as I go along
any more than you do,

41:31.080 --> 41:33.300
but I don't have a choice.

41:33.400 --> 41:38.540
Oh, Mom, you can pretend all you want,
that nothing has changed. But I have.

41:38.640 --> 41:42.740
And I'm not lying about
who I am to anybody...

41:42.840 --> 41:45.160
ever again. Not even for you.

41:45.520 --> 41:47.840
Because if I do...

41:48.120 --> 41:51.960
I'll ruin what's good in me.

41:52.720 --> 41:57.560
You... you raised me
to... to do the right thing.

41:57.680 --> 41:59.900
And be proud of myself.

42:00.000 --> 42:03.400
Don't you want me
to be that person anymore?

42:09.360 --> 42:13.800
The lying is over. You and Dad are gonna
have to make up your mind about me

42:13.920 --> 42:15.940
because I am getting married...

42:16.040 --> 42:17.740
and I'm going to have children.

42:17.840 --> 42:20.820
I'm going to have a happy and full life.

42:20.920 --> 42:23.800
And I'm not hiding it... anymore.

42:23.920 --> 42:27.520
So if you can't handle that it'll have
to be your problem from now on.

42:27.640 --> 42:29.480
Not mine.

43:09.200 --> 43:11.140
- You knew?
- Well, I...

43:11.240 --> 43:13.520
I mean, not for sure, but yeah, I knew.

43:14.720 --> 43:16.880
Since when?

43:18.040 --> 43:20.000
High school.

43:21.640 --> 43:25.280
Well, then why were you always
trying to set me up with your friends?

43:25.400 --> 43:27.720
Mom and Dad asked me to.

43:30.600 --> 43:34.800
Well, in case you're wondering
they are not coming to the wedding.

43:36.040 --> 43:38.680
And you don't have to either
if you don't want to.

43:38.800 --> 43:40.920
Why wouldn't I want to come
to your wedding?

43:41.040 --> 43:42.680
Because it doesn't stop there.

43:42.800 --> 43:45.360
We want a family,
and I'm sure you do not approve.

43:45.480 --> 43:47.600
God, Jenny.

43:48.200 --> 43:51.260
Sometimes you are really dim.
I mean, has it ever occurred to you

43:51.360 --> 43:55.420
that if you spend your life,
lying to people about who you are...

43:55.520 --> 43:57.480
you never get to know who they are.

43:58.280 --> 44:00.540
Look, I don't disapprove. Okay?

44:00.640 --> 44:04.000
I'm coming to your wedding.
You're my sister.

44:08.240 --> 44:11.420
You know, I just... I really
was dreading telling you.

44:11.520 --> 44:14.700
- Why?
- Because you're the most like Mom and Dad.

44:14.800 --> 44:17.600
No, I'm not, Jenny.

44:19.440 --> 44:21.200
You are.

45:08.240 --> 45:10.040
So?

45:11.280 --> 45:14.360
- I'm sorry.
- For what, being the favorite?

45:14.480 --> 45:15.340
What?

45:15.440 --> 45:17.720
Do you think you'd be getting away
with this if you weren't?

45:17.840 --> 45:22.000
First of all, this isn't a stunt, Anne.
This is my life.

45:22.120 --> 45:24.860
Secondly, I'm not getting away
with anything.

45:24.960 --> 45:29.280
I am nobody's favorite, not anymore.
So you need to just... get over it.

45:30.880 --> 45:33.160
Feeling unloved is not something
you just get over.

45:33.280 --> 45:36.060
Yes. It is. You just have to grow up.

45:36.160 --> 45:38.580
Why did you come here, Jenny,
to pick a fight?

45:38.680 --> 45:40.480
No.

45:41.320 --> 45:45.560
No, I... I wanted to say I was sorry
for not telling you.

45:45.960 --> 45:48.660
I wanted to, but Mom, couldn't handle it.

45:48.760 --> 45:51.260
We're sisters!
Why didn't you tell me years ago?

45:51.360 --> 45:54.060
Come on, Anne. We never really shared
our secrets with one another.

45:54.160 --> 45:55.480
And for good reason.

45:55.600 --> 45:59.960
Instead of just coming to me when you
saw me with Kitty you ran straight to Mom.

46:01.200 --> 46:02.520
Fair enough.

46:05.000 --> 46:07.880
- Can I come in?
- No.

46:08.440 --> 46:11.720
You'll over excite the kids,
and Frankie's asleep.

46:15.480 --> 46:17.720
But have a seat.

46:25.680 --> 46:28.960
- So there's something I wanna ask you...
- My wedding gown won't fit you.

46:30.120 --> 46:32.960
I don't wanna wear your wedding gown.

46:34.200 --> 46:37.560
I wanted to know
if you would be my maid of honor.

46:37.800 --> 46:40.300
If you don't want to, it's okay but...

46:40.400 --> 46:42.840
it would mean a lot to me if you would.

46:45.280 --> 46:48.600
- You want me to be your maid of honor?
- Well, yeah.

46:48.720 --> 46:51.100
I was yours, and you're my sister.

46:51.200 --> 46:53.200
I know, but...

46:55.360 --> 46:59.000
I don't know. I always felt like...

47:00.520 --> 47:03.720
you acted like I wasn't in your league.

47:03.920 --> 47:06.640
Anne... it was never that.

47:06.760 --> 47:09.680
Okay, it was never that. I just...

47:10.160 --> 47:14.320
I was in hiding. And I just really couldn't
afford to get close to you.

47:15.040 --> 47:16.760
Dad!

47:18.840 --> 47:23.080
I can't talk about this...
right now. I have to go.

47:23.600 --> 47:25.200
Okay.

47:25.320 --> 47:27.640
I'll call you later, okay?

47:29.800 --> 47:32.840
- How long have you been with Kitty?
- 5 years.

47:34.480 --> 47:37.560
When I saw you kissing,
you looked really...

47:38.360 --> 47:40.520
really happy.

47:45.600 --> 47:48.040
That grass is completely dead.

47:49.840 --> 47:51.840
It's winter.

47:52.480 --> 47:54.640
Yeah, I know, but...

47:54.920 --> 47:57.920
it's always dead. Even in the spring.

48:01.560 --> 48:03.740
Dad! Dad!

48:03.840 --> 48:05.800
I gotta go.

48:07.000 --> 48:08.920
Frankie!

48:10.040 --> 48:12.920
- What are you doing?
- I don't have any cash.

48:13.040 --> 48:15.580
Get it out of the bank like I do.
I'm not an ATM.

48:15.680 --> 48:17.820
Why are you all dressed up?
Where are you going?

48:17.920 --> 48:21.260
Didn't I tell you? Pete called.
He wants to talk to me about something.

48:21.360 --> 48:24.240
- Business probably.
- Business?

48:24.360 --> 48:27.920
You and Pete are unarmed security guards.

48:28.560 --> 48:31.200
Don't wait up. You know Pete.

48:32.560 --> 48:35.160
Why don't you ever water the grass?

48:35.720 --> 48:37.340
Why would I water the grass in the winter?

48:37.440 --> 48:41.120
Because you never water it even
in the summer and it's always dead.

48:41.240 --> 48:42.760
If it bothers you so much,
why don't you water it?

48:42.880 --> 48:44.680
Because it's not my job!

48:44.800 --> 48:48.840
I do everything else around here!
You could at least do that!

48:49.320 --> 48:51.440
I gotta go.

49:03.440 --> 49:08.320
I don't understand why she hasn't called.
I've left 6 messages, you've left 4.

49:08.440 --> 49:10.960
- 5.
- 5.

49:12.000 --> 49:14.780
Just things went
a little too far, that's all.

49:14.880 --> 49:17.100
She'll call when she calms down.

49:17.200 --> 49:20.120
You weren't there, Eddie.
I've never seen her like that.

49:20.240 --> 49:22.560
No, no. She'll calm down.

49:22.680 --> 49:25.840
What's she gonna do? Never call us again?

49:36.200 --> 49:39.440
I don't... I don't wanna go in there.

49:44.200 --> 49:46.560
I want you here.

49:58.000 --> 50:00.080
Hi, everybody.

50:03.000 --> 50:06.220
- Kitty.
- Hi. Mrs. Farrell, Mr. Farrell.

50:06.320 --> 50:07.500
Jen.

50:07.600 --> 50:10.260
When you didn't call back,
I didn't think you were coming.

50:10.360 --> 50:14.480
Of course I was coming.
Mrs. McMahan was my favorite neighbor.

50:16.160 --> 50:20.060
- Kitty, you remember Mr. and Mrs. O'Leary.
- Oh, yes. Yes, nice to see you again.

50:20.160 --> 50:23.620
Nice to see you, Kitty.
Kitty is Jenny's roommate.

50:23.720 --> 50:26.160
- Oh, right.
- Kitty isn't my roommate, Mrs. O'Leary.

50:26.280 --> 50:29.200
She is my partner,
and we've been together 5 years.

50:29.480 --> 50:31.840
We're getting married.

50:31.960 --> 50:36.000
We're a little bit old fashioned so we figured
we'd tie the knot before starting a family.

50:38.560 --> 50:39.860
Can I talk to you a minute?

50:39.960 --> 50:42.560
- I was just gonna go in...
- I wanna talk first.

50:46.960 --> 50:48.700
What are you doing?
Are you trying to hurt your mother?

50:48.800 --> 50:52.080
- How am I hurting her?
- By making a scene at a funeral.

50:52.200 --> 50:54.140
Stutzman's is a place for grief.

50:54.240 --> 50:57.020
If you wanna humiliate your mother,
go try and do it someplace else.

50:57.120 --> 51:00.560
I'm sorry if telling people who I am
and how I live is humiliating.

51:00.680 --> 51:04.040
But I am not gonna pretend to be somebody
else anymore just to make you feel okay.

51:04.360 --> 51:07.600
Why is it always about you?
It's about her too.

51:07.720 --> 51:11.280
We called you over and over again,
why didn't you reply?

51:11.400 --> 51:14.040
How do you think she felt when you walked
away from her in the arcade the other day?

51:14.160 --> 51:17.720
Why is it always about her?
Isn't there a you in this?

51:17.840 --> 51:21.680
Why don't you stop hiding behind Mom
and tell me how it's about you?

51:21.800 --> 51:26.240
Well, I will... I will tell you
about how I feel. It's not how I live.

51:26.360 --> 51:29.040
I don't understand any of it.
And I don't understand you.

51:29.160 --> 51:31.820
You're getting married, but I...

51:31.920 --> 51:33.660
I don't know who's who.

51:33.760 --> 51:36.400
- Who's who?
- Yeah, yeah. You're both feminine girls.

51:36.520 --> 51:40.260
And I don't know. I don't know who's...
I don't know what you do.

51:40.360 --> 51:44.400
- What we do?
- And I don't want to. I just...

51:44.520 --> 51:47.480
I mean, you're my daughter and...
I just don't wanna think about it.

51:47.600 --> 51:49.940
I mean, I spend enough time
at that firehouse. Men are animals.

51:50.040 --> 51:52.980
It's what they think about
when they look at porno movies.

51:53.080 --> 51:56.620
But if you were marrying a guy, I wouldn't
think about it. I'd know what you do.

51:56.720 --> 51:59.020
When I was a kid, I used to hate
to think about you and Mom in bed.

51:59.120 --> 52:02.040
It gave me the creeps,
so I think I know how you feel.

52:02.160 --> 52:05.660
Let me put your mind at rest. Hey, Kitty.

52:05.760 --> 52:09.360
My dad wants to know
if one of us straps it on in bed.

52:14.440 --> 52:16.160
I'm so sorry, Dad.
She's a little bit funny.

52:16.280 --> 52:19.080
She doesn't like to tell people
what she does or doesn't do in bed!

52:20.000 --> 52:22.620
I don't know who you are anymore.

52:22.720 --> 52:25.240
And I don't know if I care.

52:25.680 --> 52:29.580
- What's happened to you?
- I'll tell you what's happened. I grew up.

52:29.680 --> 52:33.340
I used to care so much about what the two
of you thought but not anymore. Why would I?

52:33.440 --> 52:35.940
How dare you talk to me
about meeting the right person.

52:36.040 --> 52:38.480
Do you know who you meet
every time you or Mom change?

52:38.840 --> 52:41.960
The same couple of lying cowards.

52:42.080 --> 52:45.200
From now on, I only care
about what I think and what I do.

52:45.320 --> 52:47.440
And if you don't like it,
then you can get out of my life.

52:47.560 --> 52:50.300
Believe me, I will not miss you,
it will be a relief.

52:50.400 --> 52:54.520
If all you can do is tolerate me
I will be happier when you're gone.

53:18.880 --> 53:23.640
Well, it was nice... seeing you all again.

53:25.480 --> 53:27.640
I have to go.

53:43.800 --> 53:47.400
- Your mother will come around.
- No, she won't.

53:47.680 --> 53:52.500
They never do or say anything without
the other and now he'll never come around.

53:52.600 --> 53:56.520
- Give him time.
- You don't know him.

53:57.280 --> 53:59.880
He lets a lot of stuff go but...

54:00.160 --> 54:02.340
I called him out tonight. I...

54:02.440 --> 54:07.560
I made him look like a fool in public
and now he'll never get over that, and...

54:07.680 --> 54:12.520
he hardly ever shuts the door
but when he does, it stays shut.

54:13.160 --> 54:17.800
Not that I care. Because I'm not
apologizing to anybody for anything.

54:21.040 --> 54:23.760
We have to talk about this, Eddie.

54:24.720 --> 54:28.640
I already told you. I got nothing to say.

54:28.800 --> 54:30.640
I'm not trying to defend her.
She said ter...

54:30.760 --> 54:35.700
Rose. Are you deaf? I just told you,
I've got nothing to say. I mean it.

54:35.800 --> 54:39.320
So don't bring it up with me again. Ever.

54:46.440 --> 54:47.740
Rose.

54:47.840 --> 54:49.880
- Rose.
- Shit!

54:50.000 --> 54:51.860
Rose.

54:51.960 --> 54:54.320
Hi, Ellen. Hi.

54:54.720 --> 54:56.580
I've been so worried.

54:56.680 --> 54:59.240
I left messages all week,
but you never called back.

54:59.360 --> 55:01.500
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

55:01.600 --> 55:06.380
How can you be fine after that
disgraceful incident at Stutzman's?

55:06.480 --> 55:10.540
The things she said were... unforgivable.

55:10.640 --> 55:13.660
I just hope you're not blaming
yourselves for any of this because...

55:13.760 --> 55:16.240
you've both been great parents.

55:16.680 --> 55:19.180
Did you know about them before?

55:19.280 --> 55:20.920
We knew before.

55:21.320 --> 55:24.340
I'd have lied about the married man too.

55:24.440 --> 55:28.120
Well, you're doing the right thing.

55:29.480 --> 55:32.720
- What am I doing?
- Turning your back on all of it.

55:35.360 --> 55:37.800
I can't talk now, Ellen, I have to go.

55:37.920 --> 55:41.800
Christmas will be hard, but just remember
you're doing the right thing.

55:41.960 --> 55:45.320
And any time you wanna talk,
I'm right here.

55:58.720 --> 56:02.640
- Hey, Eddie. How you doing?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

56:12.560 --> 56:16.020
Did you tell the guys what happened
at Stutzman's the other day?

56:16.120 --> 56:18.900
No. Come on, Eddie.

56:19.000 --> 56:22.140
I'd never talk about your private business
with anybody. You know that.

56:22.240 --> 56:25.460
They don't... they don't know
anything. But...

56:25.560 --> 56:29.200
Listen, Eddie, I gotta tell you.
I think this whole thing stinks.

56:29.320 --> 56:31.060
As good as you and Rose have been

56:31.160 --> 56:34.520
this is the way Jenny turns around
and pays you back?

56:35.720 --> 56:37.880
Yeah. I don't wanna talk about it.

56:38.000 --> 56:40.560
No. Okay.

56:43.240 --> 56:46.240
You know, it's funny. Her name is Kitty.

56:48.040 --> 56:49.440
What?

56:49.840 --> 56:51.260
The girl's name is Kitty.

56:51.360 --> 56:55.080
I mean, first Jenny was with a married
man, and his name was Kitty.

56:55.280 --> 56:57.760
Now, her name is Kitty.

57:16.880 --> 57:18.380
Hello.

57:18.480 --> 57:20.640
Hi, honey.

57:21.440 --> 57:23.320
Hi, Mom. What's up?

57:24.440 --> 57:27.320
Nothing, I just called to see how you are.

57:27.440 --> 57:31.020
- <i>Fine, and you?</i>
- I'm fine. How are the kids?

57:31.120 --> 57:32.480
Fine.

57:32.960 --> 57:35.040
And... Frankie?

57:35.520 --> 57:37.520
Frankie's fine.

57:37.640 --> 57:41.160
Mom, did you call for a reason
'cause I'm standing in the...

57:41.280 --> 57:42.900
driveway, and it's raining.

57:43.000 --> 57:45.800
And I have a pile of groceries
and a sleeping baby.

57:46.120 --> 57:49.040
No. No reason, it's not...
raining here yet though.

57:49.160 --> 57:51.860
I just called to say hello.

57:51.960 --> 57:54.120
Okay. I'll call you back later.

57:54.240 --> 57:57.440
- I love you, Anne.
- Yeah, okay, bye.

58:35.080 --> 58:38.000
Okay. What do you think?

58:39.920 --> 58:41.240
It's perfect.

58:41.840 --> 58:43.820
I've always dreamed
of wearing a dress like this.

58:43.920 --> 58:46.120
Oh, you look beautiful.

58:52.680 --> 58:55.340
Well, now I don't know
who looks more beautiful.

58:55.440 --> 58:58.000
- Is this a double wedding?
- Yes.

58:59.160 --> 59:03.120
Then I'll leave you alone to think. I know
you'll want to come back with your mothers.

59:06.600 --> 59:11.000
This dress isn't right. It's not right.
It's too traditional.

59:11.600 --> 59:14.960
- Well, what's wrong with traditional?
- You wanna wear the tux?

59:18.880 --> 59:21.420
My mother's not here either, Jenny.

59:21.520 --> 59:23.280
I know.

59:23.400 --> 59:28.080
Your mother's in Portland. Mine is 20
minutes up the road in rush hour traffic.

59:52.680 --> 59:54.600
- Tell me something.
- If it's about Mom, I don't wanna hear it.

59:54.720 --> 59:57.640
It's not about Mom.
I know you live in a condo...

59:57.760 --> 01:00:01.040
but if you had grass
would it be dead or alive?

01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:04.940
It would be alive.

01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:07.100
Just as I thought.

01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:10.840
Happy people do not have dead grass.

01:00:19.080 --> 01:00:21.360
I quit the bowling team.

01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:24.400
Why?

01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:27.680
They're talking behind my back.

01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:32.440
Can you do that?

01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:34.400
- Do what?
- Quit the bowling team.

01:00:34.520 --> 01:00:36.440
You're the treasurer.

01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:39.600
Yes. I can do that.

01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:44.880
Don't you wanna know
what they're saying behind my back?

01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:50.360
No.

01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:56.480
You can't just not talk about this, Eddie!

01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:07.400
We've lost our daughter!

01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:34.000
- Hello.
- <i>Hi, Anne. It's me.</i>

01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:36.480
- Hi, Mom. How are you?
- <i>I'm fine.</i>

01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:40.080
Doing a little... house work.

01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:43.260
- How are you?
- Oh, I'm fine.

01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:46.380
How about Frankie and the kids? They okay?

01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:47.900
They're fine.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:51.260
Have you seen Michael and Lorraine at all?

01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:55.480
For God's sake, Mom, if you wanna know
how Jenny is, call her. Don't call me.

01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:57.900
<i>I know that's what all
these calls are about.</i>

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.580
Listen, there's something I...

01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:03.200
I have to do. I'll call you later, okay?

01:02:03.560 --> 01:02:05.360
Okay. I love you, Anne.

01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:08.800
Oh, my God. Will you please stop saying that,
it's turned into your personal greeting!

01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:13.260
- I'm sorry. I just wanted you to know.
- <i>Yeah. I know, I know, I know, I know.</i>

01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:16.480
We all love each other,
and I have to go. Goodbye.

01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:39.660
And they never talk about it. Not a word.

01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:42.220
I wouldn't either if it was my daughter.

01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:45.240
They were such good parents.

01:04:45.520 --> 01:04:47.960
Well, they must have done something wrong.

01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:50.680
We've all had problems with our kids,
but nothing like this.

01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:53.580
I really feel sorry for them.

01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:55.580
And this wedding is embarrassing enough

01:04:55.680 --> 01:04:58.740
but those two are planning
on having children.

01:04:58.840 --> 01:05:02.420
How can they have a normal life
growing up in that house?

01:05:02.520 --> 01:05:04.460
It isn't right.

01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:08.080
Since when did you two become such
big experts on what's normal and right?

01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:11.160
Rose. We didn't mean anything.
We're just worried about you.

01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:14.220
Tell me, Marion. Is it normal
and right for your daughter

01:05:14.320 --> 01:05:18.260
to get pregnant by every passing stranger
and leave you to raise the kids?

01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:22.160
Or for... for Karen and her bum
of a husband to never get a job

01:05:22.280 --> 01:05:26.480
and... and rob you and Denny of every
last penny of your retirement savings!

01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:30.220
That's all normal and right just because
the men sleep with women!

01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:32.540
And the women sleep with men!

01:05:32.640 --> 01:05:35.540
But Jenny, who is... who is... who is...

01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:39.700
is generous and kind
and has never hurt anyone...

01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:44.760
isn't normal and right, because she
wants to marry the woman she loves.

01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:49.080
Jenny is good. And I love her.

01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:52.140
And the only thing
that isn't normal and right is...

01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:54.220
is me turning my back on that.

01:05:54.320 --> 01:05:57.920
Oh, my... Oh, my God.

01:06:22.760 --> 01:06:24.000
Hello.

01:06:24.120 --> 01:06:27.240
<i>It's Mom. Can you come down?</i>

01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:51.880
I saw a dress.

01:06:53.040 --> 01:06:55.020
Months ago, I saw a wedding dress.

01:06:55.120 --> 01:06:57.840
I knew you'd look good in.
You still might be able to get it.

01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:05.080
I'm sorry, Jenny.

01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:08.920
I'm so sorry for all of it.

01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:14.320
And if you'll let me. I'd like to help you
pick out your wedding dress.

01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:18.360
I wanna be part of your marriage.

01:07:19.080 --> 01:07:23.400
I wanna be part of everything
you do for the rest of your life.

01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:03.280
- You're late. You take 90 again?
- No. I took Carnegie.

01:08:03.400 --> 01:08:09.240
Oh, well. Traffic on Carnegie
can be pretty bad after 3:00 too.

01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:11.840
I wasn't stuck in traffic.

01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:15.280
I was with Jenny.

01:08:19.479 --> 01:08:22.319
I want us to be a part of the wedding.

01:08:32.840 --> 01:08:36.319
We've always done everything together
for as long as we've been married.

01:08:37.359 --> 01:08:39.040
But...

01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:42.680
I'll do this alone if I have to.

01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:51.920
- At least talk to me about it.
- No.

01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:54.920
No.

01:08:56.840 --> 01:08:59.319
No, you've made your choice,
I've made mine.

01:08:59.439 --> 01:09:02.160
I don't wanna explain it to anybody.

01:09:38.680 --> 01:09:41.500
- What are you so happy about, Eddie?
- What?

01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:44.040
Nothing. Just a joke.

01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:06.480
- Why isn't Denny O'Leary here today?
- He changed his shift yesterday.

01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:11.120
- How come?
- I don't know. Said it was personal.

01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:15.420
I've been on with him
since we were probies together.

01:10:15.520 --> 01:10:19.480
Lieutenant said he asked to change his
shift and wouldn't take no for an answer.

01:10:24.360 --> 01:10:27.640
I've known him since we were
in first grade together.

01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:29.200
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:31.560
That's a long time.

01:10:35.880 --> 01:10:38.040
Yeah. It is.

01:10:48.040 --> 01:10:50.300
- What's that?
- Oh, look, you're awake.

01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:52.280
- What?
- Get up. I want to show you something.

01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:54.680
Are you crazy? Do you have any idea
what time I went to bed last night?

01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:56.840
I said, get up.

01:10:56.960 --> 01:10:59.080
Look outside.

01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:06.520
At what?

01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:09.280
- The grass.
- What about the grass?

01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:12.080
It's green.

01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:14.780
You think I care what color the grass is?

01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:18.160
No. I don't.

01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:25.840
- What are you doing?
- Packing your stuff. You're moving out.

01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:27.640
- What?
- I don't wanna be married to you anymore.

01:11:27.760 --> 01:11:31.640
I would leave, but I don't think it's good
to move the kids so you have to go.

01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:33.660
Come on, Anne,
I know things haven't been...

01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:37.040
Stop. I'm not interested
in anything you have to say.

01:11:37.160 --> 01:11:38.800
You can't just kick me out
without talking about it.

01:11:38.920 --> 01:11:41.020
Why would we start talking now.
We haven't talked in years!

01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:42.800
'Cause I have a right to know
why you're doing this.

01:11:42.920 --> 01:11:45.180
- The grass.
- The grass?

01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:49.420
Yes. When I looked
at the dead grass, I realized...

01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:54.540
I was unhappy. Happy people
don't have dead grass.

01:11:54.640 --> 01:11:57.820
And... and then it was like,
the chicken and the egg.

01:11:57.920 --> 01:12:02.360
I couldn't figure out which came first.
Happiness or green grass.

01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:08.600
So I started watering it. And the more
I started watering it, the happier I felt.

01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:13.840
And then it came back to life.

01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:20.320
I don't blame you for kicking
Frankie out. The guy's a bum. But...

01:12:20.440 --> 01:12:22.640
you know, grass is grass.

01:12:22.760 --> 01:12:27.180
No, it's not. You don't have dead grass.
Michael doesn't have dead grass.

01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:29.460
- No.
- Happy people don't.

01:12:29.560 --> 01:12:33.760
And I never saw it until Jenny
came over and she was so happy.

01:12:34.360 --> 01:12:37.540
I saw the dead grass for the first time.

01:12:37.640 --> 01:12:41.080
I'll be right back.
I just have to change my order.

01:12:41.560 --> 01:12:45.520
She wouldn't have dead grass
any more than you would, Dad.

01:12:46.200 --> 01:12:49.120
She doesn't settle for less either.

01:12:53.720 --> 01:12:55.620
I don't know where to seat anyone.

01:12:55.720 --> 01:12:58.420
We're having twice as many
as we planned on having.

01:12:58.520 --> 01:13:02.520
I know. Does it really matter? Isn't everyone
just gonna be moving around anyway?

01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:04.080
Yeah.

01:13:09.160 --> 01:13:11.680
It's my father's birthday today.

01:13:12.200 --> 01:13:15.260
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:18.640
They're throwing a party for him
at my parents' house.

01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:23.960
- I'm gonna take a break, okay?
- Sure.

01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:35.340
He should know. I should tell him.

01:13:35.440 --> 01:13:38.300
Michael should tell him.
He's the one doing it.

01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:40.820
I don't wanna put... I don't wanna put...

01:13:40.920 --> 01:13:42.960
What are you guys talking about?

01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:44.920
Nothing.

01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:47.540
Are you sure?

01:13:47.640 --> 01:13:50.360
Yeah. No, I'll tell him.

01:13:54.400 --> 01:13:56.840
Hey, listen, Dad...

01:13:58.760 --> 01:14:02.640
Jenny asked me to walk her down the aisle.

01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:06.880
And I said yes.

01:16:48.600 --> 01:16:52.260
- What are you staring at?
- Nothing.

01:16:52.360 --> 01:16:55.280
I saw Rose leave for the wedding.
She looked pretty.

01:16:55.560 --> 01:16:57.880
That is not a real wedding.

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:01.880
Okay. I saw them leave
for the fake wedding.

01:17:03.080 --> 01:17:04.340
No sign of Eddie.

01:17:04.440 --> 01:17:06.640
Well, at least he's got
his head screwed on right.

01:17:06.760 --> 01:17:08.520
Honey.

01:17:08.640 --> 01:17:11.120
We were there the night Jenny was born.

01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:14.560
We'd always thought
that we'd be at her wedding.

01:17:15.240 --> 01:17:18.960
What makes you think two women
getting dressed up in wedding gowns

01:17:19.080 --> 01:17:23.600
and prancing down some hotel aisle
is the same as getting married?

01:17:25.800 --> 01:17:28.080
Jenny does.

01:17:28.200 --> 01:17:29.840
What?

01:17:30.520 --> 01:17:33.040
Jenny makes me think it.

01:18:21.640 --> 01:18:25.220
- What are you doing here?
- I saw you drive up and...

01:18:25.320 --> 01:18:27.680
door was unlocked so...

01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:30.800
Look...

01:18:32.240 --> 01:18:36.280
Maybe Ellen deserved it. I mean,
we both know how she can get.

01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:39.700
But you know, Rose said
some bad things to her and...

01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:42.040
when something really bothers me...

01:18:42.200 --> 01:18:46.240
I'm like you. You know, I... I dig in.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:52.040
We've known each other a long time and...

01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:54.800
if I don't dig myself out...

01:18:55.280 --> 01:18:57.240
I lose.

01:18:57.520 --> 01:19:00.720
And that's why I'm here.
To dig myself out.

01:19:01.720 --> 01:19:03.880
How do you do that?

01:19:05.440 --> 01:19:09.780
I don't know. I never had to do it before.

01:19:09.880 --> 01:19:12.900
I guess I start with me, I mean...

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.120
and that's why I'm here.

01:19:15.240 --> 01:19:18.400
To dig myself out of me.

01:19:35.480 --> 01:19:38.140
Are you sure that this isn't too much?
This dress isn't too much?

01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:40.600
- It's a beautiful dress.
- Okay.

01:19:40.720 --> 01:19:41.960
Eddie!

01:19:42.680 --> 01:19:45.960
I don't know if you want me here, but...

01:19:46.400 --> 01:19:48.180
I decided to come.

01:19:48.280 --> 01:19:51.960
- Why wouldn't I want you here?
- Well, I...

01:19:52.680 --> 01:19:54.740
I turned my back on you.

01:19:54.840 --> 01:19:56.720
Oh, Dad, I...

01:19:56.840 --> 01:20:00.620
I know how hard it is for you
to accept who I am, and...

01:20:00.720 --> 01:20:04.440
I lied for so long, and then, I said those
horrible things and I made you angry.

01:20:04.560 --> 01:20:07.420
No, no, no.
This has nothing to do with it. I...

01:20:07.520 --> 01:20:09.720
I wasn't angry. I...

01:20:10.120 --> 01:20:12.640
I walked away because...

01:20:14.040 --> 01:20:16.400
Because I was hurt.

01:20:17.120 --> 01:20:20.100
You said you wanted me out of your life
and you'd be relieved when I was gone.

01:20:20.200 --> 01:20:23.960
You said... you said you...

01:20:24.080 --> 01:20:26.360
you wouldn't miss me.

01:20:26.640 --> 01:20:28.660
Me.

01:20:28.760 --> 01:20:30.760
You wouldn't miss me.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.280
I'm your dad.

01:20:36.360 --> 01:20:40.660
Nobody has ever loved you
more than me, and nobody ever will.

01:20:40.760 --> 01:20:43.200
How could you not miss me?

01:20:45.200 --> 01:20:47.060
You see...

01:20:47.160 --> 01:20:48.780
when...

01:20:48.880 --> 01:20:51.760
when people hurt me, I...

01:20:52.360 --> 01:20:55.000
I don't talk about it. I...

01:20:55.880 --> 01:20:58.080
I walk away.

01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:01.440
I always walk away.

01:21:01.600 --> 01:21:03.400
But...

01:21:04.600 --> 01:21:06.920
I can't walk away from you.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:10.460
So...

01:21:10.560 --> 01:21:12.960
if that's okay...

01:21:16.400 --> 01:21:18.720
You're my daughter.

01:21:19.080 --> 01:21:22.480
And I would like to walk you
down the aisle.

01:22:25.800 --> 01:22:28.240
Living in a moment I would die for.

01:22:29.280 --> 01:22:34.760
These words best describe every minute
of everyday of the last five years.

01:22:34.880 --> 01:22:38.620
That's why I'm standing in front
of our family and our friends...

01:22:38.720 --> 01:22:42.080
but most importantly, in front of you...

01:22:43.280 --> 01:22:46.300
and in the presence of God to vow...

01:22:46.400 --> 01:22:48.900
to be your faithfully committed...

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.200
lifetime companion.

01:23:58.200 --> 01:24:00.720
Do you know what I mean
about the grass, Aaron?

01:24:00.840 --> 01:24:02.960
Yes, I do.

01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:06.500
When I move away and sell that house...

01:24:06.600 --> 01:24:09.500
that grass will die and I know it will.

01:24:09.600 --> 01:24:11.520
But my grass...

01:24:11.640 --> 01:24:15.300
the grass that is inside of me
will always be green.

01:24:15.400 --> 01:24:18.560
- Do you know what I mean?
- I do.

01:24:18.680 --> 01:24:21.060
- Are you a lesbian?
- No.

01:24:21.160 --> 01:24:22.960
Good.

01:24:24.040 --> 01:24:25.760
That's mine.

01:26:19.640 --> 01:26:23.660
Okay, everybody. This is it.
It's time for the conga line.

01:26:23.760 --> 01:26:27.600
Oh, my God! I love the conga line!
