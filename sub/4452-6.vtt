<i>Previously on Cedar Cove...</i>

00:01.898 --> 00:02.974
Is that really what you want?

00:03.047 --> 00:04.849
Take me to court and fight
over a piece of property?

00:04.849 --> 00:05.415
Yeah.

00:05.415 --> 00:07.248
- Should I tell Olivia?
- Let me.

00:07.250 --> 00:08.449
Matt?

00:08.451 --> 00:09.533
He's running away from his life.

00:09.535 --> 00:10.918
I'm starting to get worried about Olivia.

00:10.920 --> 00:12.587
I don't know where she is.

00:12.589 --> 00:13.754
I do.

00:16.876 --> 00:18.870
So...

00:20.152 --> 00:21.596
Nice to see you again.

00:21.749 --> 00:22.785
You too.

00:24.708 --> 00:25.807
Seattle?

00:26.010 --> 00:27.159
You knew that.

00:27.313 --> 00:29.088
Alex needed someone to be a good friend.

00:29.252 --> 00:31.685
And you were the only one available?

00:31.687 --> 00:33.137
Who do you think they're talking about,

00:33.139 --> 00:34.638
you or me?

00:34.640 --> 00:35.971
Oh, my guess is neither.

00:37.109 --> 00:39.143
Or my hope.

00:39.145 --> 00:41.195
Look. Alex is a friend.

00:41.197 --> 00:42.730
We're in the program together.

00:42.732 --> 00:44.648
I support that.

00:44.650 --> 00:47.985
I don't support day trips
to the city together.

00:51.540 --> 00:54.041
You know what? Why don't you join me?

00:54.043 --> 00:55.292
Oh, no, thanks.

00:55.294 --> 00:57.745
I don't... anymore.

00:57.747 --> 01:02.216
Oh! So... Jack and you?

01:02.218 --> 01:04.385
Yeah. Well, that, and we share

01:04.387 --> 01:06.220
a love of the Phillies and old Westerns.

01:08.007 --> 01:09.890
You have friends, too.

01:09.892 --> 01:11.175
We're not talking about Paul.

01:11.177 --> 01:13.811
Pretty sure they're talking about me now.

01:13.813 --> 01:16.230
I'm sorry about before...

01:16.232 --> 01:20.184
With Jeri, in Seattle, and the bars...

01:20.186 --> 01:22.152
But, Olivia, you have to trust me,

01:22.154 --> 01:23.187
Alex is a friend.

01:23.189 --> 01:25.689
That's all she's ever gonna be.

01:25.691 --> 01:26.940
I love you,

01:26.942 --> 01:29.026
I want to be with you.

01:29.028 --> 01:31.745
That's why I called you six times today.

01:31.747 --> 01:33.163
I called you back.

01:33.165 --> 01:36.583
Yeah. We just, uh, didn't connect.

01:36.585 --> 01:38.035
We need to change that.

01:38.037 --> 01:39.703
Yeah. We do.

01:39.705 --> 01:40.754
Are we going to change it?

01:40.756 --> 01:41.789
Yes.

01:44.593 --> 01:45.759
What?

01:45.761 --> 01:47.878
It was really compassionate of you

01:47.880 --> 01:49.797
to help Alex.

01:49.799 --> 01:52.099
To be honest, it felt good... to help.

01:53.552 --> 01:57.888
I think, I'd like to have
dinner alone with you tonight,

01:57.890 --> 01:59.857
which is what I had planned.

02:01.027 --> 02:03.560
I hope Alex and Paul don't mind.

02:07.400 --> 02:10.033
I think they'll be okay.

02:11.654 --> 02:13.904
Okay, that's not exactly

02:13.906 --> 02:15.906
what I had planned...

02:15.908 --> 02:17.741
but at least we are alone now.

02:18.961 --> 02:19.910
Yeah.

02:19.912 --> 02:21.161
Yeah.

02:44.770 --> 02:46.019
Hello, Olivia.

02:46.021 --> 02:48.021
Warren.

02:48.023 --> 02:49.440
Listen, I think we need

02:49.442 --> 02:51.408
to talk about your mother's house.

02:51.410 --> 02:53.026
Oh! You mean talk about

02:53.028 --> 02:54.862
how you tried to manipulate my brother

02:54.864 --> 02:56.280
into destroying our childhood home?

02:56.282 --> 02:57.281
Come on, Olivia.

02:57.283 --> 02:58.782
We're partners now.

02:58.784 --> 03:01.335
Don't you think we
should at least get along?

03:01.337 --> 03:03.036
- Partners?
- Yeah.

03:03.038 --> 03:04.455
Didn't Will tell you?

03:04.457 --> 03:05.706
Tell me what?

03:05.708 --> 03:07.958
Oh, right! I forgot. My apologies.

03:07.960 --> 03:09.293
I told him I wanted to share the good news

03:09.295 --> 03:10.377
with you in person.

03:10.379 --> 03:11.428
So here it is. Um...

03:11.430 --> 03:14.014
Will sold me his stake in the house.

03:14.016 --> 03:16.133
I-I told him that I would buy him out.

03:16.135 --> 03:17.184
And I gave him

03:17.186 --> 03:19.136
a very generous,
above-market, all-cash,

03:19.138 --> 03:21.138
no contingency offer
that he couldn't refuse.

03:22.308 --> 03:23.440
Come on, Olivia. Don't feel so bad.

03:23.442 --> 03:24.808
I mean, even if Will would've told you,

03:24.810 --> 03:26.143
you wouldn't have survived
a bidding war with me,

03:26.145 --> 03:27.144
and you know it,

03:27.146 --> 03:29.146
so you have two choices...

03:29.148 --> 03:31.732
You can sell me your half of the house,

03:31.734 --> 03:33.951
or you can go into business with me.

03:33.953 --> 03:35.319
Either way, I win.

03:35.321 --> 03:37.321
And I love that.

03:37.323 --> 03:39.373
I want to see the contracts
you got Will to sign.

03:39.375 --> 03:40.491
Right here.

03:40.493 --> 03:42.242
Oh, by the way, they're iron-clad.

03:42.244 --> 03:43.327
I'm very thorough.

03:43.329 --> 03:44.995
Have a good day!

03:54.974 --> 03:56.006
There you are!

03:57.176 --> 03:58.926
Hey, Mom.

03:58.928 --> 04:00.144
I didn't hear you come in last night.

04:00.146 --> 04:01.345
I was out late with Cliff.

04:01.347 --> 04:02.379
Because...

04:02.381 --> 04:05.065
I'm engaged! Again! For real!

04:05.067 --> 04:06.066
Oh!

04:06.068 --> 04:07.434
Wow!

04:07.436 --> 04:09.069
Ohh!

04:09.071 --> 04:11.488
And I want you to be my maid of honor.

04:11.490 --> 04:12.406
What about Olivia?

04:12.408 --> 04:13.740
Olivia's my best friend,

04:13.742 --> 04:15.108
you are my daughter,

04:15.110 --> 04:16.192
and I want us

04:16.195 --> 04:18.028
to be doing this wedding together...

04:18.029 --> 04:20.363
Planning, everything!

04:20.366 --> 04:21.531
Well, I-I thought,

04:21.534 --> 04:23.584
since you were kind of
down-playing the engagement,

04:23.586 --> 04:25.002
you and Cliff might just elope.

04:25.004 --> 04:26.870
Or have Olivia marry you at the court.

04:26.872 --> 04:28.755
No! No, now that I'm really engaged,

04:28.757 --> 04:29.756
I am all in,

04:29.758 --> 04:32.042
and I want you all in, right beside me.

04:32.044 --> 04:34.044
We need champagne!

04:34.046 --> 04:36.213
It's a little early for champagne.

04:36.215 --> 04:39.183
No! I'll put some orange juice in it.

04:39.185 --> 04:41.134
We have to celebrate.

04:46.976 --> 04:48.609
I'm worried about you.

04:48.611 --> 04:50.027
You didn't need to come here.

04:50.029 --> 04:51.228
I think I did.

04:51.230 --> 04:54.064
Since Kristen, you've
been living like a monk.

04:54.066 --> 04:57.484
It's not healthy. You need to move on.

04:57.486 --> 05:00.070
Yeah? What else do I need to do?

05:01.373 --> 05:04.408
I only say this because I love you.

05:04.410 --> 05:05.876
Could you love me a little less?

05:05.878 --> 05:06.910
No.

05:06.912 --> 05:07.744
Olivia!

05:09.415 --> 05:10.747
Hey.

05:10.749 --> 05:12.416
Good morning.

05:12.418 --> 05:13.834
Olivia Lockhart,

05:13.836 --> 05:15.419
this is Liz.

05:15.421 --> 05:17.087
- Hello.
- I'm his sister.

05:17.089 --> 05:18.305
Oh! Sister?

05:18.307 --> 05:19.306
Surprised me, too.

05:19.308 --> 05:20.557
So you're Olivia?

05:20.559 --> 05:21.925
I am.

05:21.927 --> 05:23.010
Paul talks about you a lot.

05:23.012 --> 05:24.144
He does?

05:24.146 --> 05:25.062
I don't.

05:25.064 --> 05:25.929
- He does.
- Don't.

05:25.931 --> 05:26.930
Do.

05:26.932 --> 05:28.398
He's quite impressed by you.

05:28.400 --> 05:30.017
I'm impressive?

05:30.019 --> 05:32.019
You know that you are.

05:32.021 --> 05:34.354
Are you here on vacation?

05:34.356 --> 05:36.356
The family sent me to do reconnaissance.

05:36.358 --> 05:39.192
You took a job 3,000 miles away.

05:39.194 --> 05:40.360
The family misses him.

05:40.362 --> 05:41.495
We barely hear from him...

05:41.497 --> 05:42.946
A few random e-mails and texts.

05:42.948 --> 05:44.381
He got divorced

05:44.383 --> 05:45.616
and took the first plane out of New York.

05:45.618 --> 05:47.284
Well, we're lucky to have him.

05:47.286 --> 05:48.535
You two, enjoy your breakfasts.

05:48.537 --> 05:49.953
It was nice to meet you, Liz,

05:49.955 --> 05:52.956
and to meet someone from Paul's family.

05:57.296 --> 06:00.130
It's not just the beautiful
vistas of this town

06:00.132 --> 06:02.215
that have captured your heart.

06:02.217 --> 06:04.051
She's in a long-term relationship,

06:04.053 --> 06:06.136
and we work together.

06:06.138 --> 06:07.304
Complications.

06:07.306 --> 06:08.939
I don't like complications.

06:08.941 --> 06:10.140
You used to love them.

06:10.142 --> 06:12.276
Which is why I'm divorced
and now happily single.

06:12.278 --> 06:13.610
So, come on...

06:13.612 --> 06:15.062
why are you really here?

06:16.231 --> 06:18.282
You heard about Kristen?

06:18.284 --> 06:21.068
"Divorce" means I don't
care if she remarries.

06:21.070 --> 06:23.654
Again... why are you here?

06:23.656 --> 06:26.156
I took a leave of absence from my job.

06:26.158 --> 06:28.325
Not loving it.

06:28.327 --> 06:29.593
Don't think I ever really did.

06:29.595 --> 06:32.546
Sorry your job's not
doing it for you anymore.

06:32.548 --> 06:35.999
Work's the only thing
that holds me together.

06:36.001 --> 06:37.467
We need to change that.

06:37.469 --> 06:38.385
"We"?

06:43.108 --> 06:44.224
Morning.

06:44.226 --> 06:47.311
Hey. Matt never showed up this morning.

06:47.313 --> 06:48.345
What?

06:48.347 --> 06:50.314
Yeah. He didn't call either.

06:50.316 --> 06:51.565
I'll be back.

06:51.567 --> 06:53.567
Whoa, whoa, hey. Where are you going?

06:53.569 --> 06:55.152
Well, I gotta find him. Something's up.

06:55.154 --> 06:56.269
No, what you gotta do is cover for Matt,

06:56.271 --> 06:57.437
plus do your work.

06:57.439 --> 06:58.438
No, Derek...

06:58.440 --> 06:59.523
Look, I feel for you, Luke,

06:59.525 --> 07:01.908
I do, but I need you. I mean, you take off,

07:01.910 --> 07:03.610
I can't go out, I lose the whole day.

07:03.612 --> 07:05.362
Something's wrong if
he didn't show or call.

07:08.117 --> 07:10.617
Go. I'll find someone to cover.

07:10.619 --> 07:12.536
Thanks, man.

07:16.375 --> 07:19.209
I am going to be my mother's maid of honor.

07:19.211 --> 07:20.961
My mother's.

07:20.963 --> 07:22.679
"Maid of honor."

07:22.681 --> 07:24.765
Not "matron," "maid."

07:24.767 --> 07:27.217
I am a "maid" because I am unmarried,

07:27.219 --> 07:29.436
and my mother is a bride...

07:29.438 --> 07:31.355
for the second time.

07:31.357 --> 07:34.224
I'm happy for her...
I'm just unhappy for me.

07:34.226 --> 07:35.559
I don't understand.

07:35.561 --> 07:37.227
It's not easy to say.

07:37.229 --> 07:38.028
Well, spill it.

07:39.565 --> 07:41.198
I thought...

07:41.200 --> 07:43.116
when John and I moved back here,

07:43.118 --> 07:44.735
that he was going to ask me to marry him,

07:44.737 --> 07:47.120
and then when he didn't ask me,

07:47.122 --> 07:48.739
I knew what I wanted.

07:48.741 --> 07:50.407
You wanted him to ask you.

07:50.409 --> 07:52.492
Yup.

07:52.494 --> 07:54.461
And now?

07:54.463 --> 07:56.580
We decided to take a break.

07:56.582 --> 07:59.633
As relationships go, we are at an impasse.

07:59.635 --> 08:01.968
You guys will work this out.

08:03.255 --> 08:05.422
Although 41% of marriages end in divorce.

08:05.424 --> 08:08.175
But maybe you'll catch the bouquet?

08:10.562 --> 08:13.096
So what happened to you last night?

08:13.098 --> 08:14.481
Well, Paul and I

08:14.483 --> 08:16.233
thought you guys wanted to be alone.

08:16.235 --> 08:18.151
Well, we did, but you didn't have to...

08:18.153 --> 08:20.103
Look, Olivia has been so cool

08:20.105 --> 08:22.189
with you... well, helping me.

08:22.191 --> 08:24.157
I just want to make sure...

08:24.159 --> 08:25.409
No, look. Listen.

08:25.411 --> 08:27.611
Olivia and I are working
through some things

08:27.613 --> 08:29.613
that have nothing to do with you.

08:29.615 --> 08:31.114
But I did drag you

08:31.116 --> 08:32.198
to that stupid birthday party.

08:32.201 --> 08:34.618
You didn't drag me anywhere!

08:34.620 --> 08:37.169
Well, dragged or not, thanks for going.

08:37.172 --> 08:38.587
You were there when I needed you,

08:38.590 --> 08:40.457
even though I didn't think I needed you.

08:41.626 --> 08:45.128
Which is why I wanted to ask you something.

08:45.130 --> 08:47.130
Okay. Shoot.

08:47.132 --> 08:49.132
Will you be my sponsor?

08:50.519 --> 08:51.718
I haven't had one,

08:51.720 --> 08:53.854
or needed one, since I lived back east,

08:53.856 --> 08:57.224
and, well, now I think I need one.

08:57.226 --> 08:59.109
What do you think?

08:59.111 --> 09:00.644
I mean, you've basically been doing it,

09:00.646 --> 09:03.897
I just thought we could make it official.

09:11.740 --> 09:14.741
You and I have to talk
about your bridesmaid duties.

09:14.743 --> 09:16.326
I thought you would do something small.

09:16.328 --> 09:17.794
No! I want to celebrate.

09:17.796 --> 09:19.463
Like "the whole town" kind of celebrate.

09:19.465 --> 09:20.497
What's this?

09:20.499 --> 09:22.132
Your duties.

09:23.252 --> 09:24.468
It's three pages!

09:24.470 --> 09:26.136
Well, there's been a lot of changes

09:26.138 --> 09:27.170
since my first go-around.

09:27.172 --> 09:29.589
Look! There's all these rules and parties

09:29.591 --> 09:31.007
and gifts, and, I have to say,

09:31.009 --> 09:31.975
I'm loving it.

09:33.312 --> 09:34.678
Come on, it'll be so much fun.

09:34.680 --> 09:36.763
I'll pick you up in a
few, we'll go for lunch,

09:36.765 --> 09:38.231
and then we can do some dress shopping.

09:38.233 --> 09:39.649
Today?

09:39.651 --> 09:41.351
Yeah! I'm excited.

09:41.353 --> 09:43.737
I can't go today. I'm slammed.

09:43.739 --> 09:45.689
Oh. Okay.

09:45.691 --> 09:47.407
Another day. Soon.

09:47.409 --> 09:49.776
Yeah, right. Well, then,
you'll have to excuse me.

09:49.778 --> 09:51.828
I need to go and finalize my plans

09:51.830 --> 09:53.830
for this year's charity softball game.

09:53.832 --> 09:55.282
Is it that time already?

09:55.284 --> 09:56.333
It is!

09:56.335 --> 09:57.868
And you need to pick a team.

09:57.870 --> 09:59.536
Moon's, or Thyme and Tide.

09:59.538 --> 10:00.787
You know I never play.

10:00.789 --> 10:03.540
- Never say "never."
- I'm gonna stick with "never."

10:03.542 --> 10:05.425
But I'll be there to cheer everyone on.

10:12.768 --> 10:14.601
I want in.

10:14.603 --> 10:16.469
I want the lead in the Ford case.

10:16.471 --> 10:17.938
I can do it. I'm ready.

10:17.940 --> 10:19.773
I am more than ready. Okay?

10:19.775 --> 10:21.775
Good morning, Miss Jennings.

10:21.777 --> 10:23.727
"How are you?" How am I?

10:23.729 --> 10:25.612
I'm fine. Thank you for asking.

10:25.614 --> 10:28.398
Oh, yeah. "Morning." So?

10:28.400 --> 10:30.367
It's a felony case.

10:30.369 --> 10:31.818
Yes. That's why I want in.

10:31.820 --> 10:35.322
You seem a little too happy
about diving into this one.

10:35.324 --> 10:36.540
This guy needs to go down.

10:36.542 --> 10:37.574
It's his first offense.

10:37.576 --> 10:39.242
But he has a record.

10:39.244 --> 10:40.577
But that record's not admissible.

10:40.579 --> 10:42.162
Can't be used.

10:42.164 --> 10:44.464
Let's find a way to use it.

10:44.466 --> 10:46.132
Okay.

10:48.470 --> 10:50.303
You can second chair. With me.

10:50.305 --> 10:51.504
So... what?

10:51.506 --> 10:54.307
I get to hand you Gatorade and towels

10:54.309 --> 10:56.927
while you score touchdowns
and pose for pictures?

10:56.929 --> 10:59.479
Yes.

11:07.606 --> 11:09.873
Heads up!

11:09.875 --> 11:11.691
You played ball back in Philly?

11:11.693 --> 11:13.159
Sure.

11:13.161 --> 11:15.829
Me and a bunch of seriously
overweight sportswriters, yeah.

11:15.831 --> 11:17.530
Well, the town's annual
charity softball game

11:17.532 --> 11:18.698
is in a few days

11:18.700 --> 11:20.917
and I want you to captain
the Thyme and Tide team.

11:20.919 --> 11:22.452
We're playing Moon's Cafe again.

11:22.454 --> 11:23.670
Same as last year.

11:23.672 --> 11:25.622
Oh! So we're gonna lose?

11:25.624 --> 11:26.790
Not with you playing.

11:26.792 --> 11:29.426
I don't know, Bob.

11:29.428 --> 11:30.760
No, the game raises a lot of money

11:30.762 --> 11:32.762
for the local animal shelter.
It's a really good cause.

11:34.566 --> 11:36.800
Look.

11:36.802 --> 11:39.886
Moon recruited Paul for his captain.

11:39.888 --> 11:41.638
Now, there's losing,

11:41.640 --> 11:44.307
and there's utter humiliation.

11:44.309 --> 11:45.775
Rumor has it

11:45.777 --> 11:48.478
he went to college on
a baseball scholarship.

11:48.480 --> 11:50.480
Was even scouted by some pros.

11:50.482 --> 11:52.983
Well, I guess I'm putting
my money on Moon's.

11:52.985 --> 11:54.484
Again.

11:54.486 --> 11:55.685
Come on, Jack.

11:55.687 --> 11:56.653
We need you.

11:56.655 --> 11:58.321
I just don't think I can.

11:58.323 --> 12:00.624
I mean, I've got so much
going on right now, Bob.

12:00.626 --> 12:02.325
Mm. Is everything okay?

12:02.327 --> 12:04.628
Well, Alex has asked me to be her sponsor.

12:05.831 --> 12:07.998
Oh.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.749
And you said no, right?

12:09.751 --> 12:11.801
I told her I'd think about it.

12:11.803 --> 12:14.421
Let me help her find
someone more appropriate.

12:14.423 --> 12:16.506
Big responsibility, being a sponsor.

12:16.508 --> 12:18.591
Your have enough on your plate.

12:18.593 --> 12:22.562
Well, I don't know if I'm
going to do it, but, uh,

12:22.564 --> 12:24.981
whether I can handle it or
not, that's not an issue.

12:24.983 --> 12:27.317
It is the issue.

12:27.319 --> 12:29.436
Thanks for the support, Bob.

12:31.573 --> 12:34.524
I am being supportive.

12:34.526 --> 12:37.160
Doesn't exactly feel like it.

12:46.621 --> 12:47.679
Oh. Hey, you.

12:48.329 --> 12:49.609
Hey. So, uh...

12:50.127 --> 12:52.511
I wanted to apologize for my sister.

12:52.513 --> 12:53.545
Apologize?

12:53.547 --> 12:54.846
Yeah, from this morning.

12:54.848 --> 12:55.881
I like Liz.

12:56.079 --> 12:57.575
Oh, I love her, yeah, but she's...

12:57.575 --> 12:58.398
she's chatty,

12:58.398 --> 12:59.539
and she likes to chat about me.

12:59.909 --> 13:01.803
Oh! You're afraid she's gonna tell me

13:01.805 --> 13:03.522
your deep, dark secrets?

13:03.524 --> 13:04.856
Yes.

13:04.858 --> 13:06.058
I mean, I m... No.

13:06.060 --> 13:08.360
She friendly. It's nice.

13:08.362 --> 13:11.480
Yeah. I haven't been
talking a lot about you.

13:11.482 --> 13:12.648
You know, Liz was born without a filter,

13:12.648 --> 13:14.317
so if she knows it, she says it.

13:15.102 --> 13:16.338
Hey. I was gonna grab some lunch.

13:16.339 --> 13:17.815
Can I buy you something?

13:17.814 --> 13:20.281
Oh, I've got a date.

13:20.283 --> 13:21.866
Oh! Well, say hi to Jack.

13:21.868 --> 13:23.902
No. With Liz, not Jack.

13:23.904 --> 13:25.820
I'm going to lunch with your sister.

13:25.822 --> 13:27.739
She wouldn't take "no" for an answer.

13:27.741 --> 13:29.324
Well, arguing runs in the family.

13:29.326 --> 13:30.418
I get that.

13:30.644 --> 13:32.460
Yeah, actually, it's good that
you're having lunch with her,

13:32.620 --> 13:35.178
'cause I love her, but
she's driving me crazy.

13:35.178 --> 13:36.927
And I'm really glad she asked.

13:36.929 --> 13:40.231
Gives me a chance to
find out more about you.

13:42.186 --> 13:43.435
Olivia!

13:46.874 --> 13:48.607
Are you crazy?

13:48.609 --> 13:50.108
Hello, Jeri.

13:50.110 --> 13:53.028
You can't be serious with
that article on John Comlin.

13:53.030 --> 13:56.198
Look. That article is a piece of art.

13:56.200 --> 13:59.117
That article will never
see the light of day.

13:59.119 --> 14:01.119
What? No. Jeri, no!

14:01.121 --> 14:03.121
John Comlin is a close and personal friend

14:03.123 --> 14:04.589
of the owner of the paper.

14:04.591 --> 14:05.590
So?

14:05.592 --> 14:07.209
Don't act all innocent.

14:07.211 --> 14:08.627
Look.

14:08.629 --> 14:11.797
That is a vetted, true story,
and it needs to be told.

14:11.799 --> 14:13.799
I told it. You need to run it.

14:15.102 --> 14:16.802
It's a great story.

14:16.804 --> 14:18.303
Maybe the best you've written for me.

14:18.305 --> 14:22.107
Well, you know what?
I'm an editor and I say run it.

14:22.109 --> 14:24.643
My editorial control supersedes yours.

14:24.645 --> 14:26.061
No.

14:26.063 --> 14:27.779
Jeri...

14:27.781 --> 14:29.564
this is wrong.

14:29.566 --> 14:32.033
It's not right or wrong, it's business.

14:32.035 --> 14:34.653
Come on. Do the right thing here.

14:34.655 --> 14:36.655
I'm going to run Peter's story

14:36.657 --> 14:38.990
on the local shipping company instead.

14:38.992 --> 14:42.093
I'm not willing to die on
this hill for you, Jack.

14:42.095 --> 14:44.212
The story's dead.

14:53.223 --> 14:54.339
Thank you.

14:54.341 --> 14:55.674
So? You ready?

14:55.676 --> 14:57.759
For...?

14:57.761 --> 14:59.561
For the game! The big game!

14:59.563 --> 15:02.647
Uh, yeah. Yeah, sure.

15:02.649 --> 15:05.734
"Yeah. Yeah, sure."

15:07.051 --> 15:09.149
Those are inspiring words of leadership.

15:09.306 --> 15:10.346
I'd follow you anywhere.

15:11.575 --> 15:12.741
You picking your team?

15:12.743 --> 15:13.909
I have to do that?

15:13.911 --> 15:15.861
I thought... I thought
I could just show up.

15:15.863 --> 15:17.863
Yes, that's all you have to do.

15:17.865 --> 15:19.197
Ah!

15:19.199 --> 15:21.533
If you want to be a loser.

15:33.847 --> 15:34.963
What?

15:34.965 --> 15:37.182
What?

15:38.135 --> 15:39.935
"Batman."

15:39.937 --> 15:41.052
Aw, g... Liz!

15:41.054 --> 15:42.053
Till he was 10!

15:42.055 --> 15:44.356
Nine and a half! Superheroes are important

15:44.358 --> 15:46.691
for the emotional development
of-of young children.

15:46.693 --> 15:48.059
There are studies!

15:48.061 --> 15:49.611
There are?

15:49.613 --> 15:52.147
There could be, someday.

15:52.149 --> 15:53.698
It was a Halloween costume

15:53.700 --> 15:56.785
you refused to take off and
wore for an entire month.

15:56.787 --> 15:59.237
Mom had to throw it out
when he was at a sleep-over.

15:59.239 --> 16:01.206
Winston Churchill... big Batman fan.

16:01.208 --> 16:03.241
I think.

16:03.243 --> 16:05.710
Don't worry. Your secret's
safe with me, Batman.

16:08.665 --> 16:10.749
Olivia?

16:11.969 --> 16:13.418
Hey, Grace!

16:13.420 --> 16:15.971
Oh, Liz, this is Grace
Sherman and her daughter...

16:15.973 --> 16:17.923
- Maryellen.
- Hi.

16:17.925 --> 16:19.424
- Hello.
- It's nice to meet you.

16:19.426 --> 16:21.059
We should go.

16:21.061 --> 16:23.812
Dress shopping.

16:23.814 --> 16:26.097
Very nice to meet you.

16:26.099 --> 16:27.682
I thought you said Olivia didn't have time

16:27.684 --> 16:28.984
to go dress shopping at lunch?

16:28.986 --> 16:30.769
I did.

16:30.771 --> 16:32.237
This was really nice.

16:32.239 --> 16:33.905
Let's do it again!

16:33.907 --> 16:35.774
- Yes.
- Let's not.

16:35.776 --> 16:37.158
You crashed, you were not invited.

16:37.160 --> 16:39.411
I have a meeting in
court. Thanks for lunch.

16:39.413 --> 16:41.279
This was...

16:41.281 --> 16:43.031
very... informative.

16:50.707 --> 16:52.791
We're just friends.

16:52.793 --> 16:55.760
Oh, yes, you two are very friendly.

16:55.762 --> 16:56.795
She's seeing someone else.

16:56.797 --> 16:58.013
Hmm.

17:01.301 --> 17:03.301
Yeah, I've checked the
motel and most of the town.

17:03.303 --> 17:06.021
I have no idea where he is.

17:07.273 --> 17:09.230
I shouldn't have talked
to him about his marriage.

17:10.241 --> 17:11.340
I don't know where to look.

17:11.515 --> 17:13.076
I know someone who could have some insight

17:13.246 --> 17:14.394
into what made Matt run...

17:14.752 --> 17:16.050
what makes him keep running.

17:16.633 --> 17:18.145
Have you talked to his wife?

17:18.733 --> 17:20.800
I wouldn't even know how to find her.

17:20.801 --> 17:22.935
I would.

17:22.936 --> 17:24.470
Daughter of a judge,

17:24.472 --> 17:26.439
friend of a private investigator.

17:26.441 --> 17:27.973
I could call Roy.

17:27.976 --> 17:28.975
Or...

17:28.977 --> 17:31.010
maybe I already did.

17:31.012 --> 17:34.146
Maybe I already got an address.

17:34.148 --> 17:36.115
Matt's wife?

17:36.117 --> 17:37.817
She's in Port Orchard.

17:37.819 --> 17:39.552
A ferry ride away.

17:39.554 --> 17:42.371
Not North Carolina. Like he said.

17:42.373 --> 17:44.407
No.

17:44.409 --> 17:47.043
You want to come?

17:47.045 --> 17:49.328
I think this is something
you want to do on your own.

17:54.168 --> 17:55.344
Hi, Jack.

17:55.545 --> 17:59.296
Hi. Uh, listen. Is this a bad time?

17:59.298 --> 18:01.665
I've got court.

18:01.667 --> 18:03.334
Oh, right.

18:03.336 --> 18:05.302
Oh, come on. I can talk to you.

18:05.304 --> 18:07.138
- Sit down.
- All right.

18:09.592 --> 18:11.425
What's up?

18:11.427 --> 18:13.594
Jeri.

18:13.596 --> 18:16.347
My favorite subject.

18:16.349 --> 18:17.982
She wants to kill a story of mine.

18:17.984 --> 18:19.517
Not the John Comlin piece?

18:19.519 --> 18:20.518
Yeah.

18:20.520 --> 18:22.520
Why doesn't she want to run it?

18:22.522 --> 18:23.938
She thinks it'll upset
the owner of the paper,

18:23.940 --> 18:25.689
who's friends with Comlin.

18:25.691 --> 18:26.991
What do you think?

18:26.993 --> 18:28.242
I think, as journalists,

18:28.244 --> 18:29.577
we're supposed to tell the story...

18:29.579 --> 18:31.579
Unbiased and true are the only things

18:31.581 --> 18:33.447
that are supposed to be in play,

18:33.449 --> 18:35.866
and she just won't budge.

18:35.868 --> 18:36.917
Well, I think,

18:36.919 --> 18:38.419
when you follow your convictions,

18:38.421 --> 18:39.670
you never regret it.

18:39.672 --> 18:40.838
Meaning?

18:40.840 --> 18:42.673
Get her to budge!

18:42.675 --> 18:44.041
You can.

18:44.043 --> 18:47.378
You are very persuasive
when you want to be.

18:47.380 --> 18:48.846
Thank you.

18:48.848 --> 18:52.800
I also came by to tell you something else.

18:52.802 --> 18:54.385
What is it?

18:54.387 --> 18:57.721
Alex has asked me to be her sponsor.

18:57.723 --> 18:59.974
And I wanted you to know

18:59.976 --> 19:02.026
that I'm considering it.

19:02.028 --> 19:04.395
Okay.

19:04.397 --> 19:05.779
Okay.

19:05.781 --> 19:07.648
Well, I, um...

19:07.650 --> 19:09.950
I'm late for court.

19:09.952 --> 19:11.869
Right, right.

19:27.470 --> 19:28.669
Thank you.

19:30.756 --> 19:33.591
So, I'm thinking, tomorrow,
why don't we go into Seattle,

19:33.593 --> 19:34.592
look at invitations,

19:34.594 --> 19:36.977
and maybe do some taste-testing of cakes

19:36.979 --> 19:38.929
from those fabulous Italian bakeries?

19:38.931 --> 19:41.649
I might not be able to
go to Seattle tomorrow.

19:41.651 --> 19:42.733
Olivia can go.

19:42.735 --> 19:44.735
No, honey, I want you to go.

19:44.737 --> 19:47.438
But I don't want to
hog all the wedding fun.

19:47.440 --> 19:49.440
You're not having a good time.

19:49.442 --> 19:50.824
No. I am.

19:50.826 --> 19:52.943
And you look amazing, Mom.

19:52.945 --> 19:54.445
Thank you.

19:54.447 --> 19:55.996
You're going to look
amazing, too, some day.

19:55.998 --> 19:58.749
Here.

19:58.751 --> 20:00.034
Why don't you...

20:00.036 --> 20:01.952
I like this one. Why don't you try this on?

20:03.873 --> 20:05.623
This is about you.

20:05.625 --> 20:06.874
No. This is about us.

20:08.594 --> 20:10.377
Please? For me.

20:13.933 --> 20:15.516
Actually,

20:15.518 --> 20:17.635
I promised John I'd Skype with him,

20:17.637 --> 20:19.770
and he's on nights this week.

20:19.772 --> 20:20.971
I gotta go.

20:20.973 --> 20:22.473
Sorry, Mom.

20:39.065 --> 20:40.514
So, if I understand correctly,

20:40.516 --> 20:43.401
your client is being charged
with Vehicular Assault?

20:43.403 --> 20:45.269
Correct.

20:45.271 --> 20:46.896
Proceed.

20:46.896 --> 20:49.980
My client has no priors, is a good student,

20:49.982 --> 20:53.234
and made a non-fatal error in judgment.

20:53.236 --> 20:56.237
If he is tried as an adult,
he will go to adult prison.

20:56.239 --> 20:57.621
I respectfully request

20:57.623 --> 20:59.657
my client is tried as a juvenile.

21:04.997 --> 21:08.020
Though technically not an adult,

21:08.020 --> 21:10.914
I think we're all aware
that Mr. Ford is not a child.

21:10.914 --> 21:12.136
Try him as an adult,

21:12.138 --> 21:14.004
it's a class "B" felony,
a violent offense...

21:14.006 --> 21:16.090
10 years in prison, $20,000 fine.

21:16.092 --> 21:17.558
The facts of the case support the charge.

21:17.560 --> 21:19.009
Mr. Ford became intoxicated

21:19.011 --> 21:21.679
via the use of an illegal substance

21:21.681 --> 21:23.898
and then drove his car into another car.

21:23.900 --> 21:24.932
A parked car.

21:24.934 --> 21:26.016
Which could've been filled with people.

21:26.018 --> 21:27.184
But was empty.

21:27.186 --> 21:30.020
He was driving under the influence.

21:30.022 --> 21:31.188
And my client is willing

21:31.190 --> 21:33.407
to pay the fines, go to
rehab, pay restitution,

21:33.409 --> 21:35.726
and lose his license for the next year.

21:35.728 --> 21:37.294
Your client doesn't get
to pick what punishment

21:37.296 --> 21:39.196
he will or will not do.

21:39.198 --> 21:40.948
He's a kid.

21:40.950 --> 21:42.333
Who was wasted

21:42.335 --> 21:44.034
when he got behind the
wheel of two-ton automobile.

21:44.036 --> 21:45.202
With all due respect,

21:45.204 --> 21:47.621
the criminal court system
can only keep control

21:47.623 --> 21:49.707
of the defendant until 21 years of age.

21:49.709 --> 21:50.875
And while it's true

21:50.877 --> 21:52.793
the reckless actions of Mr. Ford

21:52.795 --> 21:55.629
did not result in bodily
harm to another person,

21:55.631 --> 21:57.848
it could well have.

21:57.850 --> 22:00.184
The defendant could
easily have killed someone.

22:00.186 --> 22:01.185
For the greater good of the community,

22:01.187 --> 22:02.303
he should be tried as an adult.

22:02.305 --> 22:03.637
It's one mistake.

22:03.639 --> 22:04.688
He has a prior record.

22:04.690 --> 22:05.723
Objection!

22:05.725 --> 22:07.274
My esteemed colleague knows that record

22:07.276 --> 22:08.893
is sealed and inadmissible.

22:08.895 --> 22:10.811
Gentlemen. Sit. Both of you.

22:15.618 --> 22:17.201
I have read both your briefs

22:17.203 --> 22:19.653
and both the defense and the prosecution

22:19.655 --> 22:21.238
make compelling arguments,

22:21.240 --> 22:24.959
though I am inclined to
rule in favor of the defense.

22:24.961 --> 22:26.961
Sidebar?

22:26.963 --> 22:28.412
Your honor.

22:28.414 --> 22:31.081
I will see counsel in my chambers.

22:38.925 --> 22:41.258
You have to run that article.

22:41.260 --> 22:43.727
We've been through this.

22:43.729 --> 22:45.312
You'll regret it.

22:45.314 --> 22:46.514
I'm management now.

22:46.516 --> 22:49.099
I have to keep my eye
on the bigger picture.

22:49.101 --> 22:50.768
Who are you?

22:50.770 --> 22:53.237
I am someone who answers to an owner.

22:53.239 --> 22:55.990
I am someone who is not
having the easiest time

22:55.992 --> 22:57.408
working with that owner.

22:57.410 --> 22:58.409
And I'm someone

22:58.411 --> 22:59.910
who doesn't want to lose her job

22:59.912 --> 23:02.446
just so you can feel
like the hero reporter.

23:02.448 --> 23:04.281
No, no. No. This isn't about me.

23:04.283 --> 23:05.916
Well, it's not about me.

23:05.918 --> 23:07.368
Yes, it is.

23:07.370 --> 23:08.669
My standards aren't in question here.

23:08.671 --> 23:10.204
My standards are?

23:10.206 --> 23:12.006
Oh, please...

23:12.008 --> 23:13.174
enlighten me.

23:13.176 --> 23:14.508
As journalists,

23:14.510 --> 23:18.462
we all start out with this...
This wall of integrity.

23:18.464 --> 23:20.431
A wall, huh?

23:20.433 --> 23:22.800
Yeah, and if you don't run this story

23:22.802 --> 23:24.468
just because you're worried
about upsetting your boss,

23:24.470 --> 23:26.020
that is a chip to that wall,

23:26.022 --> 23:28.105
and every chip that you allow to happen

23:28.107 --> 23:29.306
brings you that much closer

23:29.308 --> 23:31.692
to seeing that wall fall down entirely.

23:31.694 --> 23:33.143
Wow.

23:33.145 --> 23:35.980
What a bunch of garbage.

23:35.982 --> 23:38.899
This is the real world, Jack,

23:38.901 --> 23:41.285
with real decisions
that affect real people.

23:41.287 --> 23:44.822
This isn't some final essay
in a Journalistic Ethics class,

23:44.824 --> 23:47.041
so you can save your
breath and head back home.

23:47.043 --> 23:48.876
My decision stands.

23:51.130 --> 23:53.163
The old Jeri would run the story.

23:58.804 --> 24:01.138
The old Jeri wouldn't have my job.

24:01.140 --> 24:04.592
Grow up, Jack. We all have to.

24:09.348 --> 24:12.850
Mr. Ford's record are
sealed because he's a minor.

24:12.852 --> 24:14.351
Just because it can't
be admitted into evidence

24:14.353 --> 24:15.853
doesn't make it irrelevant.

24:15.855 --> 24:18.439
If it can't be admitted
into evidence in my court,

24:18.441 --> 24:20.241
it's not evidence, and
therefore, it's irrelevant.

24:20.243 --> 24:21.525
A technicality.

24:21.527 --> 24:22.993
Due process.

24:22.995 --> 24:24.278
He's abusing the system.

24:24.280 --> 24:26.280
He has rights.

24:26.282 --> 24:27.331
So do the people of this town.

24:27.333 --> 24:29.366
He hit a parked car.

24:29.368 --> 24:30.834
It could've been filled with children.

24:30.836 --> 24:32.836
It could've been filled with cream cheese.

24:32.838 --> 24:34.038
It's court!

24:34.040 --> 24:36.373
We deal in facts, not
what the facts "might" be.

24:39.262 --> 24:40.878
He is a risk.

24:40.880 --> 24:42.513
He's remorseful.

24:42.515 --> 24:44.882
Because he got caught!

24:46.018 --> 24:48.018
Mr. Watson...

24:48.020 --> 24:49.386
Mr. Pope.

24:49.388 --> 24:51.021
I will render my decision in the morning.

24:51.023 --> 24:52.806
Thank you, gentlemen, that will be all.

24:59.231 --> 25:00.781
That will be all.

25:10.459 --> 25:12.293
So Maryellen just walked out?

25:12.295 --> 25:15.079
Yep. And Olivia blew me off.

25:15.081 --> 25:18.415
I just don't understand.

25:18.417 --> 25:21.885
Maryellen just doesn't seem
interested in this wedding,

25:21.887 --> 25:24.088
and I really want her to be.

25:24.090 --> 25:25.506
All in all,

25:25.508 --> 25:29.176
not a very scrapbook-worthy
pre-wedding entry.

25:29.178 --> 25:31.261
Well, I'll go dress shopping with you.

25:32.598 --> 25:34.014
- It's bad luck.
- Oh.

25:34.016 --> 25:35.099
But, you know,

25:35.101 --> 25:37.067
the most important thing about this wedding

25:37.069 --> 25:38.819
is you and me, right?

25:40.272 --> 25:41.905
This may not be my first wedding,

25:41.907 --> 25:43.357
but it's my last,

25:43.359 --> 25:44.908
and I just want it to be special.

25:44.910 --> 25:46.160
And it will be.

25:46.162 --> 25:48.862
No. Not if Maryellen and
Olivia aren't there with me.

25:48.864 --> 25:53.117
I mean, if I can't share
all of this with them...

25:53.119 --> 25:55.452
Hey, hey, hey. Come here.

25:59.458 --> 26:00.591
Okay.

26:02.294 --> 26:03.861
Electric?

26:03.863 --> 26:04.845
Got it.

26:04.847 --> 26:05.929
Gas...

26:05.931 --> 26:06.964
Mine.

26:06.966 --> 26:09.466
And that leaves me with water.

26:09.468 --> 26:10.434
I gotta go.

26:10.436 --> 26:11.552
Hot date?

26:11.554 --> 26:12.553
No. Better.

26:12.555 --> 26:14.104
Hot case.

26:14.106 --> 26:15.639
You really need to get out
of that courtroom more often.

26:15.641 --> 26:16.974
I'm exactly where I want to be...

26:16.976 --> 26:18.058
In the courtroom.

26:18.060 --> 26:19.476
Big case?

26:19.478 --> 26:22.029
Yeah. I can't wait. It's a felony case.

26:22.031 --> 26:24.064
You so need a date.

26:24.066 --> 26:25.616
I will take a career instead, thank you.

26:25.618 --> 26:27.618
Well, well!

26:27.620 --> 26:30.154
Rebecca. Justine.

26:30.156 --> 26:31.488
I'm Linnette.

26:31.490 --> 26:33.240
Perk down.

26:33.242 --> 26:34.458
Keep walking.

26:34.460 --> 26:35.876
I was, actually, I was
walking right over there,

26:35.878 --> 26:37.461
to the county assessor's office

26:37.463 --> 26:39.046
to register my latest purchase...

26:39.048 --> 26:40.247
It's a lovely property

26:40.249 --> 26:41.965
you might know it more as
your grandmother's house.

26:41.967 --> 26:43.083
What?

26:43.085 --> 26:44.168
Yeah, your uncle sold me
his stake in the house.

26:44.170 --> 26:45.419
Now I'm partners with your mother.

26:45.421 --> 26:47.337
Oh, she's thrilled.

26:47.339 --> 26:49.339
- No.
- Yeah. Bye-bye.

26:53.345 --> 26:55.062
I can't believe I dated him.

26:55.064 --> 26:56.513
I can't believe I almost married him.

26:58.651 --> 27:00.350
He is cute!

27:02.188 --> 27:03.353
He is.

27:03.355 --> 27:04.655
He's Lucifer.

27:04.657 --> 27:06.523
Does the devil wear pocket squares?

27:06.525 --> 27:08.025
Yes. And he lives in Cedar Cove.

27:19.019 --> 27:21.225
I don't think I've seen
you since basic training.

27:21.504 --> 27:22.658
Yeah.

27:22.765 --> 27:24.433
Well, I was surprised to
see Matt in Cedar Cove.

27:24.631 --> 27:26.140
He left a while back.

27:27.510 --> 27:28.824
Yeah, he seems a bit lost.

27:29.036 --> 27:33.288
To be honest, he's been lost
since he got back from his last tour.

27:33.491 --> 27:36.659
Since he left the Navy, he's
been too proud to ask for help

27:36.661 --> 27:37.960
so he can rebuild his life,

27:37.962 --> 27:39.461
find a new career.

27:39.463 --> 27:41.830
Not the easiest transition...

27:41.832 --> 27:45.038
Active military to normal, everyday life.

27:46.637 --> 27:47.711
So you aren't divorced?

27:48.922 --> 27:50.589
No.

27:50.986 --> 27:52.152
No. He just left.

27:52.154 --> 27:53.153
He said he'd come back

27:53.155 --> 27:54.499
when he got things sorted out.

27:54.716 --> 27:57.180
Even before the Navy, he had this problem.

27:57.980 --> 27:59.744
He doesn't want anyone to see him struggle.

27:59.901 --> 28:04.654
He was raised to believe that asking
for help was a sign of weakness.

28:04.656 --> 28:06.990
Well, he needs to come
home and deal with this.

28:06.992 --> 28:10.126
I can't make him, I've tried.

28:10.128 --> 28:13.079
I'll find him. I'll get him back.

28:14.332 --> 28:16.583
You don't have to do this, Luke.

28:16.585 --> 28:18.418
You don't have to get involved.

28:18.420 --> 28:20.003
I do.

28:20.005 --> 28:21.087
Why?

28:21.089 --> 28:23.339
Because he'd do the same thing for me.

28:34.815 --> 28:35.856
White flag?

28:37.586 --> 28:41.786
I saw that you withdrew your
motion to try Mr. Ford as an adult.

28:41.788 --> 28:43.487
I did!

28:43.489 --> 28:46.124
Someone made a more
compelling argument than I did.

28:46.126 --> 28:49.561
It's rare, but it happens.

28:49.563 --> 28:51.196
It's the right call.

28:51.198 --> 28:52.498
I was out of line.

28:52.500 --> 28:54.199
Not at all.

28:54.201 --> 28:55.565
You're a worthy opponent.

28:55.567 --> 28:57.601
And you're a worthy sparring partner.

28:57.603 --> 29:00.605
So... where's your sister?

29:00.607 --> 29:01.639
She's at the Thyme and Tide.

29:01.641 --> 29:03.174
I'm meeting her there for dinner.

29:03.176 --> 29:05.748
By the way... Bob loves her!

29:06.785 --> 29:08.352
Yeah. So.

29:08.354 --> 29:10.254
We cannot talk about the Ford case.

29:10.256 --> 29:11.623
We cannot.

29:11.625 --> 29:12.791
Can we get coffee,

29:12.793 --> 29:14.258
and not talk about the case?

29:14.260 --> 29:15.391
If you insist.

29:15.393 --> 29:16.792
Speaking of insisting...

29:16.794 --> 29:19.328
This, uh, charity softball game?

29:19.330 --> 29:21.331
Oh, Bob's passion!

29:21.333 --> 29:22.398
Yeah. I didn't know that

29:22.400 --> 29:24.197
when I agreed to captain Moon's team.

29:24.199 --> 29:25.264
Uh-oh.

29:25.266 --> 29:26.664
Yeah. I'm sure this game will

29:26.666 --> 29:28.699
further solidify the
tight-knit emotional bond

29:28.701 --> 29:30.367
that Bob and I have already made.

29:31.568 --> 29:34.302
Well, let's go get that coffee.

29:34.304 --> 29:36.273
Okay.

29:41.250 --> 29:42.914
Hey.

29:42.916 --> 29:45.916
You look deep in thought.

29:45.918 --> 29:47.651
I am.

29:47.653 --> 29:49.652
Is it the sponsor thing?

29:49.654 --> 29:52.756
No. No. It's, um, it's a work thing.

29:52.758 --> 29:53.757
Let me guess.

29:53.759 --> 29:54.857
Jeri?

29:54.859 --> 29:57.927
Mm. She surprised me.

29:57.929 --> 29:59.628
This is the preview

29:59.630 --> 30:01.596
to tomorrow's Seattle Courier online.

30:01.598 --> 30:02.798
Okay.

30:02.800 --> 30:04.701
She, uh...

30:04.703 --> 30:07.872
ran a story of mine she said she wouldn't.

30:07.874 --> 30:09.705
You know, it's one of those things,

30:09.707 --> 30:12.272
where you, uh, you think you
have somebody figured out,

30:12.274 --> 30:14.373
and then...

30:14.375 --> 30:15.610
So, this is a good thing?

30:15.612 --> 30:18.414
It's the right thing.

30:18.416 --> 30:20.348
Well, that's always a good thing.

30:20.350 --> 30:23.386
Speaking of good things or good people...

30:23.388 --> 30:25.489
I've been doing some thinking,

30:25.491 --> 30:28.723
I think I'm going to find
someone else to be my sponsor.

30:28.725 --> 30:30.925
It's too much.

30:30.927 --> 30:33.127
Look, it was wrong for me to ask you,

30:33.129 --> 30:36.296
and you're too loyal to say no.

30:37.698 --> 30:41.603
Really, Jack, thanks for everything.

30:41.605 --> 30:42.937
I don't know how

30:42.939 --> 30:44.338
I would have gotten through this time

30:44.340 --> 30:45.338
without your help.

30:45.340 --> 30:47.305
You're my rock.

30:49.340 --> 30:50.806
So...

30:50.808 --> 30:52.712
I will see you at the softball game?

30:52.714 --> 30:53.880
I wouldn't miss it.

30:53.882 --> 30:55.048
Great.

30:55.050 --> 30:55.948
Okay.

31:05.089 --> 31:06.690
Hello!

31:06.692 --> 31:07.691
Jack...

31:07.693 --> 31:10.323
I was just about to call you.

31:10.325 --> 31:12.355
I'm glad you came around.

31:12.357 --> 31:14.927
Running the story was the right choice.

31:14.929 --> 31:17.064
David called me in for
an "emergency meeting"

31:17.066 --> 31:18.798
to talk about digital media

31:18.800 --> 31:20.499
and how I'm running the paper.

31:20.501 --> 31:21.868
I think you and I both
know that this meeting

31:21.870 --> 31:23.735
has nothing to do with either.

31:23.737 --> 31:25.001
But, hey,

31:25.003 --> 31:27.838
at least my integrity's
still intact, right?

31:27.840 --> 31:30.108
Listen, why don't I
come with you as back-up?

31:30.110 --> 31:31.908
I want to be there for you.

31:31.910 --> 31:33.943
You did a good thing here.

31:35.616 --> 31:38.919
I think you've done enough already.

31:38.921 --> 31:43.524
You know what? I made
this decision on my own.

31:43.526 --> 31:45.594
I can handle it.

31:53.974 --> 31:57.413
What's going on with you and my wedding?

31:57.415 --> 31:59.416
The bridal shop...

31:59.418 --> 32:00.484
you don't want to talk about cakes

32:00.486 --> 32:02.020
or invitations.

32:02.022 --> 32:04.386
It's just so hard.

32:04.388 --> 32:05.820
What is?

32:05.822 --> 32:07.721
This. You.

32:08.822 --> 32:10.289
Helping you get married.

32:11.789 --> 32:14.124
I thought John would propose.

32:14.126 --> 32:16.726
He didn't.

32:16.728 --> 32:18.727
Oh, honey, I had no idea.

32:18.729 --> 32:19.929
And...

32:22.000 --> 32:24.935
Well, we're taking a break.

32:24.937 --> 32:26.437
Since when?

32:26.439 --> 32:29.509
Since the day you got engaged.

32:29.511 --> 32:30.711
Oh...

32:30.713 --> 32:32.947
So, uh...

32:32.949 --> 32:35.583
I don't think I can do it.

32:35.585 --> 32:36.784
Dress shopping?

32:36.786 --> 32:37.886
No! Don't even worry about it.

32:37.888 --> 32:38.987
No...

32:38.989 --> 32:40.955
I don't think I can be in the wedding.

32:42.491 --> 32:43.825
I'm sorry.

32:57.139 --> 32:58.639
You know, I'm surprised.

32:58.641 --> 32:59.974
At what?

32:59.976 --> 33:02.678
Well, just the fact that the
great Judge Olivia Lockhart

33:02.680 --> 33:03.712
sent her daughter to do her bidding.

33:03.714 --> 33:05.578
She doesn't know I'm here.

33:05.580 --> 33:07.012
Interesting.

33:07.014 --> 33:09.883
Just sell the part you got
from Will back to my mom.

33:09.885 --> 33:11.584
Do the right thing and
stay out of our lives.

33:11.586 --> 33:12.919
Save your breath, Justine. Come on.

33:12.921 --> 33:15.859
You know I'm not gonna sell
my part of the property,

33:15.861 --> 33:17.028
but you know what I will do?

33:17.030 --> 33:18.964
If your mother wants to sell me her half,

33:18.966 --> 33:22.066
I'm sure I can strike a fair deal with her.

33:23.771 --> 33:25.004
By the way, I'm looking forward

33:25.006 --> 33:26.907
to seeing you at the
softball game tomorrow.

33:26.909 --> 33:29.608
Maybe then your mother will
be in a better mood to haggle.

33:29.610 --> 33:31.211
Why are you even going to that game?

33:31.213 --> 33:33.247
It's my community.

33:33.249 --> 33:34.846
Only because we haven't
run you out of town yet.

33:36.646 --> 33:39.012
It's lovely to see you again, Justine.

33:39.014 --> 33:40.680
You know your way out.

33:40.682 --> 33:42.483
Bye-bye.

33:48.622 --> 33:50.722
Hi.

33:50.724 --> 33:52.690
What's wrong?

33:52.692 --> 33:55.128
Nobody wants to help me with my wedding.

33:55.130 --> 33:57.063
Oh, honey, where is this coming from?

33:57.065 --> 33:59.998
You blew me off to have
lunch with Paul's sister.

34:00.000 --> 34:02.101
I got pushed into that lunch.

34:02.103 --> 34:03.269
You didn't look pushed.

34:03.271 --> 34:05.404
You were laughing.

34:06.638 --> 34:09.206
You went from almost engaged, to broken up,

34:09.208 --> 34:11.178
to engaged, to this.

34:11.179 --> 34:12.178
What's "this"?

34:12.179 --> 34:14.547
Bride-crazy!

34:14.549 --> 34:16.748
Is it possible, just possible,

34:16.750 --> 34:19.050
that you are overcompensating just a bit

34:19.052 --> 34:21.885
because you're feeling a little
insecure about your choice?

34:21.887 --> 34:22.918
No!

34:24.822 --> 34:26.856
Yes.

34:26.858 --> 34:29.625
You... are going to have

34:29.627 --> 34:31.627
a wonderful wedding.

34:32.830 --> 34:35.598
And I am gonna plan it with you.

34:35.600 --> 34:36.799
I promise.

34:36.801 --> 34:37.900
So I'll have a beautiful wedding

34:37.902 --> 34:39.899
and my daughter won't be in it.

34:39.900 --> 34:41.199
What?

34:41.202 --> 34:44.071
Maryellen doesn't want to be at my wedding.

34:47.277 --> 34:50.242
So, Olivia couldn't join us?

34:50.244 --> 34:51.744
I didn't ask.

34:51.746 --> 34:53.614
But you wanted to.

34:53.616 --> 34:55.649
I didn't.

34:55.650 --> 34:56.815
Liar.

34:56.818 --> 34:58.617
Your ears are red.

34:58.619 --> 34:59.951
That means you're definitely lying.

34:59.953 --> 35:02.120
I told you, she's in a relationship.

35:02.122 --> 35:03.221
But if she wasn't?

35:03.223 --> 35:04.623
Oh, Liz...

35:04.625 --> 35:06.191
You both are in complete denial.

35:06.193 --> 35:08.094
I've seen you together all day.

35:08.096 --> 35:09.195
Liz.

35:09.197 --> 35:10.364
She's a woman who can hold her own.

35:10.366 --> 35:12.166
She's smart, she's sexy, she's funny...

35:12.168 --> 35:15.267
Just... just tell me, if
there wasn't this other guy,

35:15.269 --> 35:16.937
that you wouldn't make a move.

35:18.073 --> 35:19.039
What?

35:19.041 --> 35:21.173
Jack, um...

35:21.175 --> 35:23.108
I don't think you've met my sister, Liz.

35:23.110 --> 35:24.110
Hi.

35:24.112 --> 35:25.112
Hi.

35:25.114 --> 35:26.580
Liz, this is Jack...

35:26.582 --> 35:28.982
Olivia's boyfriend.

35:30.152 --> 35:31.386
Oh.

35:43.108 --> 35:43.926
Hey.

35:44.102 --> 35:45.394
- Hey.
- Where's Liz?

35:45.591 --> 35:47.544
I don't know. Something
to do with her old job.

35:47.714 --> 35:49.080
Said she'd join later, if she can.

35:49.419 --> 35:51.117
But did I hear correctly?

35:51.117 --> 35:52.853
Are you not playing today?

35:52.855 --> 35:54.089
I don't take sides.

35:54.091 --> 35:56.059
How very judge-y of you.

35:56.061 --> 35:57.792
There's still room on my team.

35:57.794 --> 35:59.591
Jack's captain of the other team.

35:59.593 --> 36:01.925
I need to maintain my neutrality.

36:01.927 --> 36:04.462
Oh! There's no such thing
as neutrality, it's a myth.

36:04.464 --> 36:05.963
Not when you're the judge.

36:05.965 --> 36:07.496
Not a courtroom.

36:07.498 --> 36:09.063
I'm always the judge.

36:09.065 --> 36:10.630
You are, aren't you?

36:13.967 --> 36:14.980
You okay?

36:14.980 --> 36:16.481
Yeah, I will be when I find Matt.

36:16.483 --> 36:17.715
You will.

36:17.717 --> 36:19.616
- I think I need some help.
- Roy's great.

36:19.618 --> 36:20.916
I thought maybe you could help me.

36:20.918 --> 36:21.884
Yeah?

36:21.886 --> 36:22.952
Yeah.

36:22.954 --> 36:24.119
Okay.

36:25.420 --> 36:27.254
Hey!

36:27.256 --> 36:28.621
No hugging in baseball.

36:31.794 --> 36:33.029
That's yours!

36:33.031 --> 36:34.698
I got it, I got it.

36:34.700 --> 36:35.865
It's mine! I got it!

36:35.867 --> 36:36.933
Oof!

36:36.935 --> 36:37.934
Ohh...

36:41.007 --> 36:42.474
You missed it.

36:46.910 --> 36:47.876
- Hey, you okay?
- You all right?

36:47.878 --> 36:49.379
My ankle.

36:49.381 --> 36:51.747
All right. Come on. Let's get her up.

36:52.915 --> 36:54.416
We're short a player.

36:54.418 --> 36:55.450
Olivia?

36:55.452 --> 36:56.851
Oh, I think I'll pass.

36:56.853 --> 36:57.985
If you don't play...

36:57.987 --> 36:59.453
we're going to forfeit.

36:59.455 --> 37:00.987
Did I hear someone say "forfeit"?

37:00.989 --> 37:02.822
What? You'd win by default?

37:02.824 --> 37:04.290
Okay.

37:04.292 --> 37:05.124
No forfeit!

37:05.126 --> 37:07.927
You don't have enough players!

37:09.663 --> 37:11.098
Think of the kids.

37:11.100 --> 37:13.002
You're playing to benefit
the animal shelter.

37:13.004 --> 37:15.401
Think of the puppies.

37:15.403 --> 37:16.902
Come on, get in the game!

37:16.904 --> 37:18.204
Do it for the puppies!

37:24.010 --> 37:26.644
All right! Ump! We got a substitute!

37:30.415 --> 37:32.082
It's nice to, uh, see

37:32.084 --> 37:34.753
that we're on the same side for a change.

37:34.755 --> 37:37.623
But remember, Olivia,
there's no "I" in "team."

37:37.625 --> 37:40.556
No. But there is one in "insufferable."

37:42.023 --> 37:44.627
All right, everybody! Listen up here!

37:44.629 --> 37:45.796
I want a good game.

37:45.798 --> 37:48.165
I want a clean game.

37:48.167 --> 37:49.801
Not hitting below the
belt. No eye-gouging.

37:49.803 --> 37:50.803
Moon...

37:50.805 --> 37:52.908
Not a prizefight.

37:52.910 --> 37:55.010
Oh, of course.

37:55.012 --> 37:56.379
Okay, just one last question then,

37:56.381 --> 37:57.680
before we get started...

37:57.682 --> 37:59.715
Are any of you taking steroids?

38:03.856 --> 38:05.421
All right, then!

38:05.423 --> 38:07.057
Let's play some ball!

38:07.059 --> 38:08.993
All right!

38:08.995 --> 38:09.995
All right, let's go.

38:09.997 --> 38:11.633
Batter up!

38:14.570 --> 38:15.567
Let's go!

38:15.569 --> 38:16.767
Come on, Jack!

38:16.769 --> 38:19.469
Let's play some ball!

38:23.005 --> 38:24.769
Yeah!

38:29.773 --> 38:30.906
Oh...

38:30.908 --> 38:32.140
Whoa!

38:32.142 --> 38:33.875
- Whoo!
- You got this!

38:33.877 --> 38:35.945
Easy out.

38:35.947 --> 38:36.914
Come on, Jack!

38:36.916 --> 38:38.183
Cliff, I've been thinking.

38:38.185 --> 38:40.119
It's about Maryellen.

38:40.121 --> 38:42.089
Our wedding has got her really upset.

38:42.091 --> 38:43.191
Yeah.

38:43.193 --> 38:44.559
I'm thinking we should elope.

38:44.561 --> 38:45.761
What?

38:47.531 --> 38:49.497
Whoa!

38:49.499 --> 38:50.198
Run!

38:50.200 --> 38:51.969
Cliff!

38:51.971 --> 38:53.104
What're you doing?

38:53.106 --> 38:54.473
Whoo!

38:54.475 --> 38:56.006
Cliff!

38:56.008 --> 38:58.907
Come on! Hustle it out there!

39:03.112 --> 39:05.080
Hey... I just wanted to say thanks.

39:05.082 --> 39:06.748
What for?

39:06.750 --> 39:08.584
For letting Jack be my sponsor.

39:09.719 --> 39:10.585
Come on, Jack!

39:13.622 --> 39:14.889
Whoa!

39:14.891 --> 39:16.424
- Whoa!
- Time out.

39:17.793 --> 39:19.126
You're not really

39:19.128 --> 39:20.992
supposed to call "time out" in-in...

39:20.994 --> 39:22.727
Time!

39:24.498 --> 39:25.698
That was at my head.

39:25.700 --> 39:26.799
Ball got away from me.

39:26.801 --> 39:27.967
Take your base. That's a walk.

39:27.969 --> 39:29.634
Oh! I don't want a walk,
I want a decent pitch

39:29.636 --> 39:30.601
that's not at my head.

39:32.003 --> 39:34.170
Well, then let's play ball!

39:34.172 --> 39:35.938
- Whoo!
- Come on, Paul!

39:35.940 --> 39:37.205
Batter up!

39:37.207 --> 39:39.140
Get ready!

39:43.013 --> 39:44.845
Jack!

39:44.847 --> 39:45.880
Go!

39:45.882 --> 39:46.915
Whoo!

39:48.153 --> 39:49.620
Whoo!

39:49.622 --> 39:50.821
Yeah!

39:50.823 --> 39:53.656
Whoo!

40:04.279 --> 40:06.080
Come on, Jack!

40:06.082 --> 40:07.250
Easy out.

40:07.252 --> 40:09.386
Easy out.

40:09.388 --> 40:10.722
Guaranteed strike-out.

40:16.099 --> 40:18.000
Strike three! You're out.

40:18.002 --> 40:19.704
I had to buy a scoreboard,

40:19.706 --> 40:21.106
uniforms, and give the coach

40:21.108 --> 40:22.307
two weeks at my lake house,

40:22.309 --> 40:24.276
just so he could warm the bench.

40:30.920 --> 40:32.653
Let's go, Luke! Go!

40:34.889 --> 40:36.823
Hey. What's the matter?

40:36.825 --> 40:38.557
You're gonna be Alex's sponsor?

40:40.392 --> 40:41.859
I wish we could've talked about it

40:41.861 --> 40:43.160
before you decided.

40:43.162 --> 40:45.695
Anything else you want Alex to tell me?

40:53.244 --> 40:54.144
Safe!

40:54.146 --> 40:55.914
Oh... Ouch.

40:55.916 --> 40:56.749
Whew!

40:57.919 --> 40:59.287
Hey. Sorry about that.

40:59.289 --> 41:01.687
No, you're not.

41:01.689 --> 41:02.721
Hey, we got a problem here?

41:02.723 --> 41:05.025
Uh, yeah. You.

41:05.027 --> 41:06.729
Oh, no, no, no, no. No, no.

41:06.731 --> 41:08.196
Paul, just back off, man.

41:08.198 --> 41:09.362
Whoa, now, boys.

41:09.364 --> 41:10.896
My problem is that you can't pitch

41:10.898 --> 41:12.365
and almost knee-capped
me on that last play.

41:12.367 --> 41:14.068
Come on, guys. It's a game.

41:14.070 --> 41:15.271
Hey, you were between me and the base.

41:15.273 --> 41:16.942
Why don't you just relax, all right?

41:16.944 --> 41:18.063
Don't tell me what to do.

41:18.063 --> 41:19.123
Yeah? Or what?

41:19.289 --> 41:21.572
- You want to take this outside?
- Well, you know what? We are outside.

41:21.572 --> 41:22.784
- Oh, good.
- Yeah.
