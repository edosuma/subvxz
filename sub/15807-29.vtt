¶ Just sit right back
    and you'll hear a tale ¶

00:05.606 --> 00:07.673
¶ A tale of a fateful trip ¶

00:07.742 --> 00:10.042
¶ That started
    from this tropic port ¶

00:10.110 --> 00:12.744
¶ Aboard this tiny ship ¶

00:12.813 --> 00:15.380
¶ The mate was
     a mighty sailin' man ¶

00:15.449 --> 00:17.516
¶ The Skipper brave and sure ¶

00:17.585 --> 00:20.085
¶ Five passengers
      set sail that day ¶

00:20.153 --> 00:22.120
¶ For a three hour tour ¶

00:22.189 --> 00:25.290
¶ A three hour tour ¶

00:25.359 --> 00:27.358
[thunder rumbling]

00:27.427 --> 00:29.361
¶ The weather
    started getting rough ¶

00:29.430 --> 00:31.797
¶ The tiny ship was tossed ¶

00:31.865 --> 00:34.399
¶ If not for the courage
    of the fearless crew ¶

00:34.468 --> 00:36.401
¶ The Minnow would be lost ¶

00:36.470 --> 00:38.703
¶ The Minnow would be lost ¶

00:38.772 --> 00:41.273

(Skipper)
      Gilligan, I think
      that's deep enough.

01:21.682 --> 01:24.115
Gilligan,
   we're digging a bait trap.

01:24.184 --> 01:26.117
Not an elephant pit.

01:26.186 --> 01:28.320
That's enough, Gilligan.

01:29.990 --> 01:31.723
Gilligan, that is enough.

01:34.695 --> 01:36.027
Will you stop that?

01:36.096 --> 01:38.664
Now get out of there, so we
  can get the files in there.

01:40.334 --> 01:42.468
Hey, Skipper, look
      at this shiny stone. Look.

01:42.536 --> 01:44.703
Never mind that, get out
of there, Gilligan.

01:46.807 --> 01:50.475
I say, old chaps that's
 a jolly good job you're doing.

01:50.544 --> 01:52.777
It'd go much faster, Gilligan,
 if you'd just help.

01:52.846 --> 01:54.846
Sorry, old being,
      not my line of work.

01:54.914 --> 01:57.282
- What's that, Gilligan?
  - I have a shooting marble.

01:57.351 --> 01:59.885
I didn't know there were any
of these on the island.

02:03.757 --> 02:06.124
- He found it!
      - Yeah, in the sand.

02:06.193 --> 02:07.926
He found the eye of the idol.

02:07.995 --> 02:10.162
What he found is
 a semi-precious piece of quartz

02:10.229 --> 02:11.663
known as a cat's eye.

02:11.732 --> 02:15.467
Professor, what he found is
the eye of the idol Mertrezar.

02:15.536 --> 02:17.970
Gilligan, anybody who finds this
between now and sun-down

02:18.038 --> 02:19.738
has three wishes
for anything he wants.

02:19.807 --> 02:22.074
Gilligan, it's a cat's eye
      worth about $11.

02:22.142 --> 02:24.510
It's worth millions, Gilligan.
It's been lost for centuries.

02:24.578 --> 02:27.012
And the finder gets
anything that he wishes for.

02:27.080 --> 02:28.679
That's just
            native superstition.

02:28.748 --> 02:31.749
No, it's not. I've seen a little
around these islands for years.

02:31.818 --> 02:34.486
- The finder gets his wishes.
 - He gets $11.

02:34.554 --> 02:36.454
If so, I wish
   for a gallon of ice-cream.

02:36.523 --> 02:38.256
- But it's not true.
      - It is.

02:38.325 --> 02:40.091
- Hey, what's that?
    - If you've been here--

02:40.160 --> 02:42.427
I certainly have
and I know for a fact..

02:45.199 --> 02:46.798
[Skipper and Professor arguing]

02:51.371 --> 02:53.405
[argument continues]

02:53.473 --> 02:55.941
- It's ridiculous.
       - It's true.

02:56.010 --> 02:57.342
It's chocolate.

03:05.552 --> 03:09.487
I repeat, silly superstitions
incocted by ignorant savages.

03:09.556 --> 03:11.323
Professor, I notice
           it hasn't stopped you

03:11.391 --> 03:13.592
from enjoying
                 your ice-cream.

03:13.660 --> 03:16.527
For which, I'm thankful to the
plane or liner which lost it.

03:16.596 --> 03:19.564
- That's possible, Skipper.
  - Trust in me, little buddy.

03:19.633 --> 03:22.100
You have two wishes left.
       Please don't waste them.

03:22.169 --> 03:25.270
- Yeah, don't waste your time.
 - Don't worry, I won't.

03:25.338 --> 03:27.338
- I only have to--
     - Oh, what's the use?

03:27.407 --> 03:30.775
Superstition,
      silly superstition.

03:30.844 --> 03:34.146
Superstition or not, it's
 a treat I shall long remember.

03:34.214 --> 03:37.316
- Wish, I had three wishes.
  - I wish, we were home.

03:37.384 --> 03:39.117
- In Hollywood.
        - In Palm beach.

03:39.186 --> 03:40.419
In Fort Knox.

03:41.821 --> 03:44.789
Remember now, Gilligan. The
third wish is to get us rescued.

03:44.858 --> 03:46.291
Right, Skipper.

03:46.360 --> 03:50.361
About the second wish, maybe
 something we could all enjoy.

03:50.430 --> 03:52.698
How about a motorcycle?
We'll take turns riding it.

03:52.766 --> 03:54.165
Well, I think it's..

03:54.234 --> 03:55.600
You should think
            about a neighborhood

03:55.669 --> 03:58.503
of a million dollars a piece.

03:58.572 --> 04:00.939
Where I live that neighborhood
  is considered a slum area.

04:01.008 --> 04:04.709
Mr. Howell, after all a million
dollars is hardly petty cash.

04:04.778 --> 04:07.612
- It is to me.
- Okay, I won't wish for money.

04:07.681 --> 04:11.383
Let me tell you something,
there's money and there's money.

04:12.619 --> 04:14.752
Gilligan, will you concentrate?

04:14.821 --> 04:17.488
How can the boy concentrate,
 everyone's cluttering his mind.

04:17.557 --> 04:19.491
He should be thinking
          of a mountain of gold.

04:19.560 --> 04:21.659
That's all you
ever think about, is gold.

04:21.728 --> 04:23.361
No, sometimes
            I think of platinum.

04:23.430 --> 04:24.963
All I think about
       is a motorcycle.

04:25.032 --> 04:27.098
Will you stop mentioning
that word motorcycle?

04:27.167 --> 04:28.766
With a side car and a siren.

04:28.835 --> 04:32.004
- Gilligan, if I hear motor--
 - Blam, blam, blam!

04:33.439 --> 04:35.374
[mimicking motorcycle]

04:39.379 --> 04:41.313
Heavens to Keenan Wynn.

04:42.583 --> 04:45.183
If we use this to weave
material. Will it shrink?

04:45.252 --> 04:46.717
Oh, not a bit.

04:46.786 --> 04:50.155
It'll have the strength
       and consistency of linen.

04:50.223 --> 04:51.590
Oh, here comes, Gilligan.

04:51.658 --> 04:54.725
Stereo outfit for
  the tweeter and two woofers

04:54.794 --> 04:57.095
a genuine picture
               of good Gibson.

04:57.163 --> 05:00.632
Soda fountain with all the
flavors including sassafras.

05:00.701 --> 05:04.069
- There goes Gilligan.
   - Yes, going, going, gone.

05:04.137 --> 05:05.304
He's just being Gilligan.

05:15.783 --> 05:18.316
Why, Gilligan.
Imagine bumping into you here.

05:18.385 --> 05:19.985
Why, don't I live here anymore?

05:20.053 --> 05:22.587
Of course, you do.
Why don't you whittle a while?

05:22.656 --> 05:24.655
No, got too much
                on my mind.

05:24.724 --> 05:26.291
I'll bet
it's that second wish.

05:26.360 --> 05:28.660
I don't know what you bet,
      but you won.

05:28.728 --> 05:31.430
What I'm saying, is when things
are at their darkest.

05:31.498 --> 05:35.934
When you're in trouble
and need help. Who do you go to?

05:36.002 --> 05:37.935
My mother.

05:38.004 --> 05:40.538
- Your mother is not here.
   - Neither is my father.

05:40.607 --> 05:42.340
- Ah, but, that's it.
     - What's it?

05:42.409 --> 05:44.743
We'll pretend that
I'm your father.

05:44.811 --> 05:47.779
Now, you've a problem, we'll sit
down together and solve it.

05:47.848 --> 05:50.147
- You think it'll work?
    - Of course, it will.

05:50.216 --> 05:52.050
Okay, Skipper. Let's try.

05:57.224 --> 05:59.290
- Hi, dad.
           - Hi, son.

05:59.359 --> 06:01.025
Where's your moustache?

06:01.094 --> 06:04.162
- My what?
  - My dad wears a moustache.

06:04.231 --> 06:06.465
Alright, go out
and try again.

06:11.171 --> 06:12.803
Hi, dad.

06:12.872 --> 06:14.005
Hi, son.

06:14.074 --> 06:17.541
- What's on your mind?
     - What's on your lip?

06:17.610 --> 06:20.778
Never mind. Now, what's
on your mind, son?

06:20.847 --> 06:25.049
- Where are your glasses?
- Your father wore glasses too?

06:25.118 --> 06:26.884
As long as I can remember.

06:26.953 --> 06:29.488
Alright, go out and
we'll try out again.

06:34.761 --> 06:36.094
Hi, dad.

06:36.163 --> 06:38.663
Son, how many times
      have I told you

06:38.731 --> 06:41.866
when you're talking to somebody
look them right in the eye.

06:41.935 --> 06:45.303
Skipper, my dad was real short
  I used to look down at him.

06:45.372 --> 06:47.505
Well, how's this?

06:47.574 --> 06:49.707
Dad, how'd you
             get on this island?

06:49.776 --> 06:52.310
I've been waiting for you, son.
Where have you been?

06:52.378 --> 06:53.779
Where's mother?

06:58.952 --> 07:03.388
A red tri-cycle, no.
   It's a blue tri-cycle, no.

07:03.457 --> 07:06.624
- A white tri-cycle, no.
    - Hi, Gilligan.

07:06.693 --> 07:09.093
A red, white and blue tri-cycle.

07:09.162 --> 07:10.461
I said, "Hi, Gilligan."

07:10.530 --> 07:12.764
I'm working on it, Skipper.
I'm working on it.

07:12.832 --> 07:15.333
I think you better wish
         for a pair of glasses.

07:15.401 --> 07:17.902
I'm sorry, Ginger. I'm so upset
about this wishing business.

07:17.971 --> 07:20.705
Of course, you can't think
   if you're tensed and nervous.

07:20.774 --> 07:23.808
You got to relax.
  Come with me, it'll relax you.

07:23.877 --> 07:24.876
Okay.

07:24.944 --> 07:26.444
- Get into the hammock.
    - Okay.

07:26.512 --> 07:28.613
Up you go.

07:28.682 --> 07:30.548
(Gilligan)
           Oops.

07:30.617 --> 07:31.849
I'm relaxed.

07:31.918 --> 07:35.921
Gilligan, you have to
        co-operate, just unwind.

07:35.989 --> 07:39.357
Let everything go.
              There.

07:39.426 --> 07:43.995
Now, just imagine that your body
is just floating along.

07:45.098 --> 07:49.067
Every part of you
               feels calm

07:49.136 --> 07:51.903
calm, calm.

07:53.540 --> 07:56.774
Gilligan? Gilligan!
      Not that relaxed.

07:56.843 --> 07:58.776
I'm sorry. So, where was I?

07:58.845 --> 08:02.346
You were about to wish that you
were going to be a movie star.

08:02.415 --> 08:05.216
- I was?
           - Why not?

08:05.285 --> 08:06.851
- Yeah, why not?
        - Sure.

08:06.920 --> 08:09.787
Just wish that you were
Burt Lancaster, Laurence Olivier

08:09.856 --> 08:13.090
Richard Burton and Carry Grant,
all rolled into one.

08:13.159 --> 08:15.026
You know what I'd
be all rolled like that.

08:15.094 --> 08:17.895
- What?
            - Lumpy.

08:17.964 --> 08:20.098
You'd be the most sought
    after movie star.

08:20.166 --> 08:21.733
- I would?
      - And you know what?

08:21.801 --> 08:24.568
You'd have your choice
of leading ladies to pick from.

08:24.637 --> 08:26.571
Oh, yeah, I would.

08:26.640 --> 08:28.806
And who would you pick?

08:28.875 --> 08:31.977
- You know who.
  - I know but tell me anyway.

08:33.913 --> 08:35.413
Lassie.

08:35.482 --> 08:37.982
Oh, Gilligan,
                you're terrible.

08:44.090 --> 08:45.690
[music]

08:49.229 --> 08:52.030
- What are you doing down there?
- Thinking of the second wish.

08:52.098 --> 08:55.099
This is no place to think.
   Come on, up on your feet.

08:55.168 --> 08:56.834
I already
         tried that, Mr. Howell.

08:56.903 --> 08:59.103
There's only one method
to concentrate and that's yogi.

08:59.172 --> 09:01.406
Yogi? You want me to be
         a baseball player.

09:01.474 --> 09:04.209
No, not Yogi Bear. I'm thinking
the mysticism of the Aryan.

09:04.277 --> 09:06.277
Don't you understand?
         The land of the swamis.

09:06.346 --> 09:07.578
You've got to practice yogi.

09:07.647 --> 09:09.380
No, you made me
stand on my head.

09:09.449 --> 09:10.982
That's it!
            That's yogi exactly.

09:11.051 --> 09:12.550
- No, wait.
        - On your head!

09:12.619 --> 09:14.786
Couldn't do it as a kid.
Can't do it now.

09:14.854 --> 09:16.154
It's no time to argue.

09:16.223 --> 09:18.456
I'm not arguing.
   I can't stand on my head.

09:18.525 --> 09:22.060
Come on, up, up, over you go.

09:22.129 --> 09:24.462
I bet the ideas are rushing
    into your head, aren't they?

09:24.531 --> 09:27.031
It's not working. All I'm
   thinking is not falling.

09:27.100 --> 09:30.368
I'll shake you a little to make
sure the blood gets to the head.

09:30.436 --> 09:32.003
Oh, comfy?

09:32.072 --> 09:36.308
Mr. Howell, you sure I'm going
 to find the answer this way.

09:36.376 --> 09:38.843
You'd be amazed,
        what I can find.

09:38.912 --> 09:40.946
Yogi, stay there, mysticism.

09:44.050 --> 09:46.150
- Lovey, my dear. Make room.
  - What for?

09:46.219 --> 09:48.352
- The money.
 - We haven't got much with us.

09:48.421 --> 09:52.056
- Only a few hundred thousand.
 - We'll take home more money.

09:52.125 --> 09:55.360
The eye of the idol, how darling
of Gilligan to give it to us.

09:55.429 --> 09:57.562
That boys is generous to a ball.

09:57.631 --> 10:01.432
He's so unselfish. I think for
a friend, he'd turn inside out.

10:01.501 --> 10:03.834
And upside down too, my dear.

10:03.903 --> 10:05.469
Lovey, make a little wish.

10:05.538 --> 10:08.739
Oh, the holidays with the Prince
and Greys would be divine.

10:08.808 --> 10:11.542
Better than that, I'll
        buy that little country.

10:11.611 --> 10:15.312
Come with me, we'll make
 a giant wish. Take the flower.

10:15.381 --> 10:20.352
I wish for 20 billion dollars in
the giant economy size package.

10:23.456 --> 10:26.191
Perhaps, they've to send for it
from the Federal Reserve Bank.

10:26.259 --> 10:29.394
Darling, if Gilligan's gonna
wish us of the island by evening

10:29.463 --> 10:30.928
we won't have
time to wait.

10:30.997 --> 10:33.598
Lovey, you're right as usual.
   I'll make it easier.

10:33.667 --> 10:37.636
Cancel that order for twenty
   billion, make it ten billion.

10:40.507 --> 10:42.340
Five billion.

10:44.477 --> 10:46.577
A hundred thousand.

10:46.646 --> 10:48.646
Nine and a quarter.

10:48.714 --> 10:50.081
Trading stamps?

10:50.149 --> 10:53.084
Maybe they can't find the money.
We'll lend it to them.

10:53.153 --> 10:55.987
I've been duped. I've been taken
by that pink cheeked bum-kin.

10:56.056 --> 10:58.723
- Yes, we were so nice to him.
 - That's the last time.

10:58.792 --> 11:01.526
Believe me, I'll never pull
 anything sneaky on him again.

11:01.594 --> 11:03.728
Put the flower there.

11:08.335 --> 11:09.734
Gilligan!

11:15.609 --> 11:19.577
Gilligan, all you're gonna get
 out of that, is a headache.

11:19.646 --> 11:21.812
Oh, I'm way past that, Skipper.

11:21.881 --> 11:24.916
Ba-humberg on your
    magic powers and deeds.

11:24.985 --> 11:26.384
You took the eye?

11:26.453 --> 11:28.653
Merely to test and approve.
  It's nothing at all.

11:28.721 --> 11:30.488
Mr. Howell, you just
            don't understand.

11:30.557 --> 11:33.057
Gilligan found it
   and only he can make it work.

11:33.126 --> 11:35.459
That was mumbo-jumbo.
     There's nothing to it.

11:35.528 --> 11:37.061
My first wish came true.

11:37.130 --> 11:39.397
It was easily explained
    by the Professor.

11:39.465 --> 11:41.232
I should've remembered
     before I tried it.

11:41.301 --> 11:44.001
Oh, Mr. Howell, these things
    only work only one way.

11:44.070 --> 11:46.704
Oh, certainly, with the full
moon over your left shoulder

11:46.773 --> 11:48.773
with Mars in conjunction
with the North star.

11:48.841 --> 11:51.576
With a hind leg of a horn,
towed in your pocket.

11:51.644 --> 11:53.745
No, Mr. Howell,
        I stood and said

11:53.814 --> 11:55.546
I wish for a gallon
     of vanilla ice-cream.

11:55.614 --> 11:57.181
That's exactly right.

11:57.250 --> 12:00.684
It isn't even raining vanilla,
 strawberry or tutti-frutti.

12:00.753 --> 12:02.620
Gilligan, do you realize
        what you've done?

12:02.688 --> 12:04.155
No, wh-wh-why?

12:04.224 --> 12:06.624
Your second wish,
              vanilla ice-cream.

12:06.693 --> 12:08.025
I wished for vanilla ice-cream.

12:08.094 --> 12:10.394
Might is well make
it French vanilla.

12:10.463 --> 12:13.231
Gilligan, look what just came
 floating in the lagoon again.

12:17.370 --> 12:19.804
Does French Vanilla taste kind
 of smooth and creamy?

12:20.740 --> 12:23.307
And rich and full bodied.

12:23.376 --> 12:24.976
French vanilla.

12:25.045 --> 12:28.346
- God, it works.
   - Now, are you satisfied?

12:28.414 --> 12:30.648
You know, what tastes
great with this? Caramel sauce.

12:30.716 --> 12:32.416
I wish I had some--

12:32.485 --> 12:34.785
Gilligan, your third wish.
     Don't express another wish.

12:34.854 --> 12:38.589
- It'll be your third one.
 - But I was only gonna wish--

12:38.658 --> 12:40.191
Everybody, we're leaving.

12:40.260 --> 12:42.893
- Lovey, start packing again.
 - Yes, we're going home.

12:42.962 --> 12:45.964
Meet us in the hut area.
        Come on, Gilligan.

12:54.474 --> 12:57.941
And just how
 is this miracle to take place.

12:58.010 --> 12:59.610
Planning to leave
       by magic carpet?

12:59.679 --> 13:03.047
Well, I must say the ice-cream
 gave the legend added weight.

13:03.116 --> 13:06.717
- Not only the legend, darling.
- I'll get back to health-club.

13:06.786 --> 13:10.421
Three times round the track,
 sauna bath I'll be usual self.

13:10.490 --> 13:13.357
Mr. Howell, in sometime you'll
 be back in your usual hut.

13:13.426 --> 13:15.193
I wish you come
      with us, Professor.

13:15.262 --> 13:16.860
Mary Ann, you're not
      going anywhere.

13:16.929 --> 13:18.830
None of us are
      if Gilligan doesn't.

13:18.898 --> 13:20.865
That ice-cream was dropped
   from a plane.

13:20.933 --> 13:23.268
We'll send the same one
    back for you, Professor.

13:23.336 --> 13:26.304
- Eh-eh, touché, Skipper.
   - There's Gilligan.

13:26.373 --> 13:29.039
Well, well, if it isn't
    Merlin the magician.

13:29.108 --> 13:30.641
No, it isn't, Professor.
    It's me, Gilligan.

13:30.710 --> 13:32.343
What have we got there,
    Gilligan?

13:32.412 --> 13:35.246
Souvenirs, I got these nifty
rocks, and a swell ash-tray.

13:35.315 --> 13:37.849
These swell bird eggs. Look at
how the circles go round?

13:37.918 --> 13:40.351
- They go round and round--
 - Gilligan, very interesting.

13:40.420 --> 13:42.420
But when you gonna
get us off the island?

13:42.489 --> 13:45.022
Right now, Skipper. There I
 reach my pocket and get the--

13:45.091 --> 13:46.690
Reach my pocket..

13:46.759 --> 13:49.493
- I've got a hole in my pocket
 - What you thinking, Gilligan?

13:49.562 --> 13:52.697
The eye of the idol, you
couldn't have lost it, did you?

13:52.765 --> 13:56.334
- Oh, yes, I did.
  - When did you see it last?

13:56.403 --> 13:58.970
I could've lost it in the caves
where I got these rocks.

13:59.038 --> 14:00.971
By the tree,
       I got these eggs.

14:01.040 --> 14:02.840
Or the oyster bed,
      I got this ash-tray.

14:02.908 --> 14:04.375
'Or maybe in the hut.'

14:04.443 --> 14:07.211
Well, that certainly narrows
  down the possibilities.

14:07.280 --> 14:09.079
We've got to find it
before sun-down.

14:09.148 --> 14:12.149
Oh, it's almost an hour.

14:12.218 --> 14:14.051
Ginger, you and the Professor
 take the cave

14:14.120 --> 14:15.586
'where he got those
      nifty rocks.'

14:15.655 --> 14:17.855
'Mr. and Mrs. Howell,
     take the oyster bed'

14:17.924 --> 14:19.290
'where he got the dandy shell.'

14:19.359 --> 14:20.891
'Mary Ann, we'll
        take the tree'

14:20.960 --> 14:23.093
'where he found
    those swell bird eggs.'

14:23.162 --> 14:25.229
Skipper, what should I take?

14:25.298 --> 14:27.331
There's many things
  to mention for you to take.

14:27.400 --> 14:29.233
- Why don't you search the hut?
- Okay.

14:29.301 --> 14:31.869
And don't get yourself lost
  like you did that jewel.

14:31.938 --> 14:35.539
That's impossible, Skipper, I'm
too big to fit inside my pocket.

14:35.608 --> 14:37.876
Come on, Mary Ann.

14:42.615 --> 14:44.182
Thurston, I protest.

14:44.250 --> 14:46.217
Darling, you have to look
       through the oysters.

14:46.285 --> 14:48.853
Oh, to think that
we've stooped to manual labor.

14:48.922 --> 14:52.023
On the contrary we are the ones
 wealthy enough to do this.

14:52.092 --> 14:53.458
Wealthy enough?

14:53.526 --> 14:55.826
After all, they are called
      Oyster Rockefeller.

14:55.895 --> 14:57.996
Oh, darling.
You're so witty.

15:04.137 --> 15:05.936
There's a tree
           with a nest, Skipper.

15:06.005 --> 15:08.906
[Skipper sighs]

15:08.975 --> 15:11.109
[melodic music]

15:16.249 --> 15:18.682
That does it, Mary Ann.
We've covered every inch.

15:18.751 --> 15:20.884
But we can't give up now.

15:20.953 --> 15:23.221
Say, maybe it's lodged
          in the tree.

15:24.223 --> 15:26.056
That nest is quite a ways up.

15:26.125 --> 15:28.326
But if Gilligan can get up
there, anybody can.

15:28.395 --> 15:31.095
Eye of the idol.

15:31.163 --> 15:33.998
Eye of the idol.
        Eye of the idol.

15:34.067 --> 15:35.733
Oh, where are you?

15:35.802 --> 15:37.067
Eye of the idol.
        Eye of..

15:37.136 --> 15:40.505
O-oh.
            Ow. Oh.

15:41.907 --> 15:44.541
Eye of the idol.
        Oh, eye of the..

15:44.610 --> 15:46.410
Oh!

15:46.479 --> 15:48.146
Oh, no.

16:01.227 --> 16:03.694
Oh! Look, everybody, a pearl.

16:03.762 --> 16:05.897
Oh! Oh, look nobody.

16:05.966 --> 16:08.066
Ah, darling.
         I need some new pearls.

16:08.134 --> 16:11.168
- These are last years.
    - It's flawless, Lovey.

16:11.237 --> 16:14.472
Ah, the old Howell-luck.
It's certainly carrying on.

16:18.411 --> 16:20.511
- I refuse.
 - You're just being stubborn.

16:20.579 --> 16:23.681
- What I'm being is sensible.
 - Alright, I'll do it.

16:23.750 --> 16:26.884
Ginger, you are
hardly dressed for spelunking.

16:26.953 --> 16:29.287
Professor, what did you say?

16:29.355 --> 16:33.524
Spelunking. A spelunker is a
person whose hobby's Speleology.

16:33.593 --> 16:35.592
In other words,
poking around in caves.

16:35.661 --> 16:36.793
Oh!

16:36.862 --> 16:38.095
If it'll make you happy

16:38.164 --> 16:39.897
I'll crawl in there
and take a look.

16:39.966 --> 16:42.533
Are you going to do it
       with a positive attitude?

16:42.601 --> 16:44.368
What possible difference
could my attitude make?

16:44.437 --> 16:46.303
All the difference
              in the world.

16:46.372 --> 16:48.238
Attitude is one of the key words
in method-acting.

16:48.307 --> 16:51.475
Ginger, all I'm doing is looking
for a $11 worth of quartz.

16:51.544 --> 16:54.344
Well, to get into the mood,
     you got to think mole.

16:54.413 --> 16:57.382
- You got to think what?
    - Mole. Like this.

16:58.584 --> 17:01.252
- Now you try it.
       - Alright.

17:03.489 --> 17:07.057
Definitely not mole.
 Looks more like a gopher to me.

17:07.126 --> 17:09.059
- Gopher.
       - It's your eyes.

17:09.127 --> 17:11.094
- My eyes?
- Yeah, they're not sad enough.

17:11.163 --> 17:13.531
- Moles have sad eyes.
     - Oh.

17:17.869 --> 17:19.303
What are you doing now?

17:19.372 --> 17:23.307
I'm making sure a hawk doesn't
swoop down and carry me off.

17:23.375 --> 17:26.143
Everything's gonna be alright.
  Just think mole.

17:26.211 --> 17:29.046
Oh! Just think mole.

17:29.115 --> 17:30.881
Just think mole.

17:30.950 --> 17:34.218
Just think mole. Just think..

17:34.287 --> 17:36.287
[melodic music]

17:38.524 --> 17:41.058
- Oh! He's almost there.
    - Yeah.

17:41.127 --> 17:43.094
Oh, easy does it, Skipper.

17:43.162 --> 17:45.329
[grunting]

17:47.133 --> 17:48.499
It's empty.

17:48.568 --> 17:49.666
You know why?

17:49.735 --> 17:51.402
No. Why, Gilligan?

17:51.471 --> 17:54.371
Because that's a weak branch.
 You see, birds are real smart.

17:54.440 --> 17:56.707
They don't build their nests
    on weak branches--

17:56.775 --> 17:57.741
[creaking]

17:57.810 --> 17:58.776
Timber.

17:58.845 --> 18:00.278
[thud]

18:13.092 --> 18:15.526
Lovey, I've come to
a definite decision.

18:15.594 --> 18:16.827
Yes, dear.

18:16.895 --> 18:19.597
We're definitely going to sell
our house in Oyster Bay.

18:19.665 --> 18:21.165
Yes.

18:22.735 --> 18:24.669
Well, any luck?

18:24.737 --> 18:25.802
[grunting]

18:25.871 --> 18:27.104
Not yet.

18:27.173 --> 18:29.340
Oh! What-what happened
          to your head?

18:29.409 --> 18:31.742
I bumped it on the wall.
    Cave is dark inside.

18:31.811 --> 18:34.946
Oh! Well, forget about
   thinking mole. Think bat.

18:35.014 --> 18:36.012
Think bat?

18:36.081 --> 18:38.249
- Bat.
          - Think bat.

18:38.317 --> 18:40.618
- Think bat.
          - Bat. Yeah.

18:42.589 --> 18:44.322
[melodic music]

18:59.905 --> 19:03.441
Gilligan, not even you could
lose a jewel inside a banana.

19:03.510 --> 19:05.843
- You never can tell.
     - I can tell.

19:05.912 --> 19:07.411
Now, gimme that.

19:10.816 --> 19:13.216
This isn't the time
         for an afternoon snack.

19:13.285 --> 19:15.586
We have to find
            the eye of the idol.

19:15.655 --> 19:18.222
- It's almost sundown.
   - How about the waterfall?

19:18.291 --> 19:19.823
Were you there before the cave?

19:19.892 --> 19:21.359
- Nope.
   - 'After the Oyster bed?'

19:21.427 --> 19:22.727
- Nope.
     - When were you there?

19:22.795 --> 19:24.895
Last Saturday. Remember,
    Skipper was kind of hot.

19:24.964 --> 19:27.398
'Thought I'd go in the
   waterfall, take a shower.'

19:27.466 --> 19:30.434
(Ginger)
    'I found it.
    I found it. I found it.'

19:30.502 --> 19:33.404
That's Ginger.
Come on.

19:36.943 --> 19:38.942
Oh! Hey, what's wrong with you?

19:39.011 --> 19:40.577
I am a bat.

19:40.646 --> 19:43.113
You look more like
       a gopher with a ear-ache.

19:43.182 --> 19:44.448
Never mind him. Where is it?

19:44.516 --> 19:46.450
Here it is. I got it.

19:46.519 --> 19:48.452
- Oh, yeah.
 - Oh, she found it, Gilligan.

19:48.521 --> 19:50.754
- By Joe, I think she found it.
- Mary Ann.

19:50.823 --> 19:53.123
You, Professor and Ginger, go to
the Lagoon. We'll tell the rest.

19:53.192 --> 19:55.793
Okay. See you later.

19:55.862 --> 19:58.428
Oh, Gilligan. Please now,
don't lose it this time.

19:58.497 --> 20:01.432
Now you can count on me, sir.

20:02.368 --> 20:05.369
- Gilligan.
          - Oh!

20:05.438 --> 20:07.938
It's the other eye, Skipper.
    It's the other eye. The eye.

20:08.007 --> 20:10.574
Gilligan, you not only
got a hole in your head.

20:10.643 --> 20:13.410
There is hole in your pocket.
Put it in the other pocket.

20:13.479 --> 20:15.947
Oh, yeah, you're right.
         Okay, Skipper.

20:17.816 --> 20:20.350
Mr. and Mrs. Howell.

20:20.419 --> 20:23.120
- Mr. and Mrs. Howell.
    - 'I'm here, Gilligan.'

20:23.189 --> 20:25.356
- Where?
         - 'I'm here.'

20:27.193 --> 20:29.360
Ah, there you are,
Gilligan, my boy.

20:31.497 --> 20:34.064
- Any luck?
 - Yeah. Ginger found it. See.

20:34.133 --> 20:35.632
Well, that figures it wouldn't
be among the oysters.

20:35.701 --> 20:38.268
- It could've been.
      - It's impossible.

20:38.337 --> 20:39.736
This is July. There isn't
any R in the month.

20:39.805 --> 20:41.806
Never thought of that.
          Where is Mrs. Howell?

20:41.874 --> 20:44.141
Well, she's in there..
Heavens to Fulton's fish market.

20:44.210 --> 20:45.409
I buried her.

20:45.478 --> 20:49.347
Lovey. Lovey, where are you?

20:49.415 --> 20:50.614
Here I am.

20:50.683 --> 20:53.551
A thousand pardons, my dear.

20:53.619 --> 20:56.753
To think I've spent five years
learning to like these things.

20:56.822 --> 20:58.956
And now...ish.

20:59.025 --> 21:01.425
- 'So, Gilligan.'
- Yeah, bu-but, what about him?

21:01.494 --> 21:03.060
He doesn't want to come.
        He doesn't have to.

21:03.129 --> 21:06.130
- Last chance, Professor.
   -<i> Bon voyage.</i>

21:06.199 --> 21:08.332
- Come on, Gilligan.
      - Oh, yeah.

21:08.400 --> 21:10.134
Not in that pocket.
Has a hole in it, remember?

21:10.202 --> 21:13.037
Oh, yeah.

21:13.105 --> 21:15.906
No, Gilligan. Don't say it.
Don't say you've lost it again.

21:15.975 --> 21:19.443
- Okay. I won't say it.
   - Gilligan, how could you?

21:19.511 --> 21:22.179
Easy. Put it in
   the other pocket and it fell.

21:22.247 --> 21:23.480
Yup, he could do that.

21:23.549 --> 21:25.616
Rescue or no,
I'm gonna shuck another oyster.

21:25.685 --> 21:27.751
Had it when
         I was with the Howells.

21:27.820 --> 21:29.953
It'll be between here
and the oyster bed.

21:30.022 --> 21:31.989
- That's reasonable.
     - I'm glad you agree.

21:32.058 --> 21:34.992
We're never gonna find that
 little jewel in all this sand.

21:35.061 --> 21:37.961
Sure we will. Take off your
 shoes. Walk in a straight line.

21:38.030 --> 21:40.631
Somebody will step on it.
       Here hold these. Here.

21:40.700 --> 21:43.199
Skipper, take your shoes off.
   You have big feet.

21:43.268 --> 21:45.769
Little buddy. Gilligan. Look.

21:45.838 --> 21:48.438
- Oh, you found it real fast.
 - Now, put your hand out.

21:48.507 --> 21:50.140
- Now make a fist.
       - Uh-huh.

21:50.209 --> 21:51.676
Now start wishing.

21:52.511 --> 21:53.878
I'm not going.

21:53.946 --> 21:56.947
After I reserve first class
passage for seven people.

21:57.015 --> 21:58.949
Not fair leaving the Professor
  here by himself.

21:59.018 --> 22:01.052
- Excuse me.
- You can't stay alone with him.

22:01.120 --> 22:04.088
It's not proper.
Just telling, he's a chaperone.

22:04.157 --> 22:07.090
Darling, they're gonna
miss you at the horse show.

22:07.159 --> 22:08.625
- You.
          - Oh, Lovey.

22:08.694 --> 22:11.462
Jesus. Sun is starting
     to go down.

22:11.531 --> 22:13.697
- Oh, bye.
   - Come with us, Professor.

22:13.766 --> 22:15.165
But you're not going anywhere.

22:15.234 --> 22:17.568
We were, until you started
      to be a party pooper.

22:17.637 --> 22:21.706
I'm not going. Just go.
I'm gonna stay with my Thurston.

22:21.774 --> 22:25.275
Oh, that's the old
     pioneer stud, my dear.

22:25.344 --> 22:28.011
Please. Now, the sun
 is going down. Make your wish.

22:28.080 --> 22:29.714
I can't, Skipper.

22:29.782 --> 22:32.749
I can't leave the Professor and
 Mary Ann and the Howells here.

22:32.818 --> 22:35.552
Count me out too. Hollywood
  would have to do without me.

22:35.621 --> 22:39.423
Alright. Alright. I give in.
But on one condition.

22:39.492 --> 22:41.558
Anything, Professor.
Anything. Just name it.

22:41.627 --> 22:44.394
If I tried, will you forget
about all this nonsense?

22:44.463 --> 22:46.262
- Oh, yes.
          - Oh, yeah.

22:46.331 --> 22:49.566
Come on, everybody get together.
Everybody get together, come on.

22:49.635 --> 22:50.834
- Alright, Gilligan.
      - Yeah.

22:50.903 --> 22:52.369
Go.

22:52.437 --> 22:54.638
I wish we were off this island.

22:58.577 --> 23:00.578
[rambling]

23:08.521 --> 23:10.287
Gilligan, you did it again.

23:10.356 --> 23:12.590
You got us off the island,
into the lagoon.

23:12.658 --> 23:14.758
- I should have said Hawaii.
  - I wish you had.

23:14.826 --> 23:16.727
- Wish we were in Hawaii.
   - Not now, Gilligan.

23:16.796 --> 23:18.128
You've made
your third wish.

23:18.197 --> 23:20.130
Wish we were in Los Angeles.
    Wish we were in Chicago.

23:20.198 --> 23:22.633
New York. Ohio.

23:31.176 --> 23:32.476
[music]

23:36.248 --> 23:38.782
As the wealthiest man
in the town, Gilligan. I would..

23:38.851 --> 23:41.718
Just forget it, will you?

23:41.787 --> 23:44.154
You know, digging that day-trap
loosened that little peninsula

23:44.223 --> 23:46.390
of land and floated us
     out into the lagoon.

23:46.459 --> 23:49.927
- You've no faith, Professor.
 - Not in fantasy or wishes.

23:49.996 --> 23:52.563
- Everybody is mad at me, huh?
 - Not mad exactly.

23:52.632 --> 23:55.366
We just felt that you let us
down, into the lagoon

23:55.434 --> 23:56.734
as a matter of fact.

23:56.802 --> 23:58.168
It wasn't your fault, Gilligan.

23:58.237 --> 24:00.938
Of course not. You did what
the Skipper told you.

24:01.007 --> 24:03.807
He told you to wish us
off the island and you did.

24:03.876 --> 24:05.709
I didn't say
                into the lagoon.

24:05.778 --> 24:07.544
You know whose fault
      it is? This.

24:07.613 --> 24:10.413
You know, Gilligan, I never did
 think that semi-precious stones

24:10.482 --> 24:12.149
did a thing for you.

24:12.218 --> 24:14.452
Won't cause me anymore trouble.

24:16.855 --> 24:18.322
What, it's
         a great idea, Gilligan.

24:18.390 --> 24:21.191
But a waste of energy. You
      already had three wishes.

24:21.260 --> 24:24.194
I hope whoever finds it
has better luck with it than I.

24:24.263 --> 24:27.898
Hey, that's right. Whoever finds
it next gets three wishes. Ha.

24:27.967 --> 24:30.201
- I love it.
        - Well, come on.

24:31.804 --> 24:33.170
- See you later, Gilligan.
   - Professor.

24:33.238 --> 24:35.205
Thought you don't believe
   in that stuff.

24:35.274 --> 24:37.440
Oh, I don't.
 It's completely unscientific.

24:37.509 --> 24:41.011
'Absolutely absurd. Violates
  every rule of common sense.'

24:41.080 --> 24:43.079
And it's completely
    contrary to the rules of

24:43.148 --> 24:44.648
logic and intelligence.

24:44.717 --> 24:46.517
But just in case.

25:02.734 --> 25:04.001
¶ Now this is a tale
      of our castaways ¶

25:04.070 --> 25:06.136
¶ They're here
    for a long, long time ¶

25:06.205 --> 25:08.571
¶ They'll have to make
     the best of things ¶

25:08.640 --> 25:10.607
¶ It's an uphill climb ¶

25:10.676 --> 25:12.743
¶ The first mate
     and his skipper too ¶

25:12.812 --> 25:14.812
¶ Will do their very best ¶

25:14.880 --> 25:16.946
¶ To make the others
      comfortable ¶

25:17.015 --> 25:18.982
¶ In the tropic island nest ¶

25:19.051 --> 25:21.417
¶ No phones, no lights,
    no motorcars ¶

25:21.486 --> 25:23.486
¶ Not a single luxury ¶

25:23.555 --> 25:25.722
¶ Like Robinson Crusoe ¶

25:25.791 --> 25:27.725
¶ It's primitive as can be ¶

25:27.793 --> 25:29.926
¶ So join us here
     each week my friends ¶

25:29.995 --> 25:32.029
¶ You're sure
        to get a smile ¶

25:32.098 --> 25:34.698
¶ For seven stranded castaways ¶

25:34.767 --> 25:36.166
¶ Here on Gilligan's isle ¶
