WEBVTT

00:01.701 --> 00:06.105
And that is how I got
Liza Minelli's poop on my shoe.

00:06.107 --> 00:08.374
(laughing)

00:08.376 --> 00:10.576
Hey, what's your
problem, Cleveland?

00:10.578 --> 00:12.511
I've just had
a terrible day.

00:12.513 --> 00:13.645
(sighs)

00:13.647 --> 00:14.780
Okay, what happened?

00:14.782 --> 00:17.149
(crying): My divorce
was finalized,

00:17.151 --> 00:20.319
and I lost the
house to Loretta.

00:20.321 --> 00:22.821
Oh, my God, I've never seen
a black guy cry before.

00:22.823 --> 00:25.190
I always thought you guys
just got more pissed off.

00:25.192 --> 00:27.326
Geez, Cleveland, where
are you gonna live?

00:27.328 --> 00:28.427
I don't know.

00:28.429 --> 00:31.230
Quagmire, could I stay
on your gross couch?

00:31.232 --> 00:32.698
No, I need that
for humping strangers.

00:32.700 --> 00:36.168
How about you, Joe?
Can I stay at your house?

00:36.170 --> 00:37.236
No.

00:37.238 --> 00:38.270
I understand.

00:38.272 --> 00:39.838
Plus, it's not just me.

00:39.840 --> 00:42.141
I also got custody
of Cleveland Jr.

00:42.143 --> 00:44.143
What is he,
14 years old now?
Yep.

00:44.145 --> 00:46.678
Man, he aged faster
than Kathleen Turner.

00:46.680 --> 00:48.147
Good news, Kathleen.

00:48.149 --> 00:50.582
You've been offered the
leading role in a new feature.

00:50.584 --> 00:51.550
What part?

00:51.552 --> 00:53.085
What else? The babe.

00:53.087 --> 00:58.257
ANNOUNCER:
Wow, The Babe seems
to be calling his shot.

00:59.426 --> 01:00.459
(fans cheering)

01:00.461 --> 01:03.362
Ah, great. Now we're losing.

01:05.598 --> 01:09.435
Dad, when am I gonna get
hair around my grits?

01:09.437 --> 01:10.836
Oh, you'll get there,
Cleveland Jr.

01:10.838 --> 01:13.172
But right now, we got
bigger problems than that.

01:13.174 --> 01:16.208
Your mama wants this house
by tomorrow at sundown.

01:16.210 --> 01:18.243
Where we gonna go?
Exactly.

01:18.245 --> 01:19.244
Exactly who?

01:19.246 --> 01:20.446
This ain't no
knock-knock joke.

01:20.448 --> 01:22.614
We gotta figure
out what we're gonna do.

01:22.616 --> 01:23.582
Light it, Brian.

01:23.584 --> 01:25.350
Peter, I don't
wanna do this.
Do it, Brian!

01:25.352 --> 01:26.819
It's the only way I'm
gonna catch that bird.

01:26.821 --> 01:29.154
ROADRUNNER:
Meep meep!
Here he comes. Light it!

01:29.156 --> 01:30.689
(Roadrunner whooshing)

01:34.160 --> 01:37.763
No, no, no, no, no, no!

01:37.765 --> 01:39.131
Doggone it!

01:39.133 --> 01:40.332
That's it! No more!

01:40.334 --> 01:42.868
I'm tired of being kicked
around by this world!

01:42.870 --> 01:45.170
BRIAN:
I'm sorry, Cleveland.
It's all right.

01:45.172 --> 01:46.271
I tried to stop him.

01:46.273 --> 01:48.207
I don't blame you, Brian.

01:48.209 --> 01:51.176
You're a dog! A dog!

01:52.679 --> 01:53.912
Hello, everyone.

01:53.914 --> 01:56.415
Thank you all for coming.

01:56.417 --> 01:57.249
Ha.

01:57.251 --> 01:59.885
Anyway, I have
an announcement to make.

01:59.887 --> 02:03.288
Cleveland Jr. and I are
moving to California,

02:03.290 --> 02:05.290
so I can pursue
my lifelong dream

02:05.292 --> 02:07.159
of being a minor league scout

02:07.161 --> 02:08.927
for a professional baseball
organization.

02:08.929 --> 02:11.363
Who's gonna run that
deli you never go to?

02:11.365 --> 02:15.267
When you sell Boar's Head,
it pretty much runs itself.

02:15.269 --> 02:16.401
So, I put in a call

02:16.403 --> 02:19.471
to my old batting instructor,
Mr. Joe Torre.

02:19.473 --> 02:21.540
So, Joe Torre,
who coached the Yankees

02:21.542 --> 02:24.276
to four world championships,
was your old batting instructor,

02:24.278 --> 02:26.278
and this is the first
we're hearing of it?

02:26.280 --> 02:28.280
See, this is exactly
why I'm leaving.

02:28.282 --> 02:32.484
Nobody ever asks anything about
what Cleveland's got goin' on.

02:32.486 --> 02:35.787
But if Peter wants to put
together a new A-Team,

02:35.789 --> 02:37.189
or overthrow a British pub,

02:37.191 --> 02:39.925
<i>or recreate all the</i>
<i>whole damned</i>
<i>Star Wars movies,</i>

02:39.927 --> 02:42.928
I'm expected to jump on board,
no questions asked.

02:42.930 --> 02:46.565
Well then, I guess we're going
to have to find a new Ringo.

02:46.567 --> 02:49.768
Well, gosh, Cleveland,
we're gonna miss you.

02:49.770 --> 02:51.370
Is there anything you
need before you go?

02:51.372 --> 02:55.908
Um, you think you and Bonnie
could kiss each other just once?

02:55.910 --> 02:57.910
Well...
I-I-I-I don't know.

02:57.912 --> 03:00.345
I don't know.
I suppose.

03:00.347 --> 03:02.247
We might need
some champagne.

03:08.221 --> 03:11.557
(both moaning)

03:11.559 --> 03:13.692
LOIS:
Oh, Bonnie.

03:13.694 --> 03:16.295
Gah-ha-ha-ha-dang!

03:16.297 --> 03:17.062
That's the first time

03:17.064 --> 03:19.798
I ever asked for anything
I really wanted!

03:19.800 --> 03:22.401
QUAGMIRE:
Touch-- touch boobs.

03:23.536 --> 03:24.736
Well, this is it.

03:24.738 --> 03:27.573
I didn't think it was
gonna be so hard.

03:27.575 --> 03:28.774
Good-bye, kids.

03:28.776 --> 03:30.309
Good-bye,
Mr. Cleveland.

03:30.311 --> 03:32.311
Bye.
Bye, chocolate people.

03:32.313 --> 03:33.445
Quagmire, Joe,

03:33.447 --> 03:36.081
don't y'all go drinking
any beers without me.

03:36.083 --> 03:38.016
Ha-ha-ha.
I know you will.

03:38.018 --> 03:41.687
Take care of yourself.
Bye, chocolate people.

03:41.689 --> 03:43.322
Good-bye, Peter.

03:43.324 --> 03:44.323
Don't say good-bye.

03:44.325 --> 03:46.959
The French say <i>au revoir.</i>

03:48.061 --> 03:50.696
QUAGMIRE:
Touch-- touch boobs.

03:53.466 --> 03:55.300
(engine starts)

03:56.436 --> 03:57.336
What the hell?!

03:57.338 --> 03:59.338
He's getting
his own show?!

moving to California

04:33.707 --> 04:35.374
is the right decision
for us?

04:35.376 --> 04:37.442
Well, it's pretty hard
to steal second

04:37.444 --> 04:39.378
if your foot's
still on first.

04:39.380 --> 04:40.512
That sounds folksy.

04:40.514 --> 04:41.580
What does it mean?

04:41.582 --> 04:43.982
It means you gotta
take chances in life

04:43.984 --> 04:45.450
to find true happiness.

04:45.452 --> 04:46.785
That sounds gay.

04:46.787 --> 04:48.053
Gays are smart.

04:48.055 --> 04:49.454
Just look at how many lines

04:49.456 --> 04:53.358
Gene Hackman has been able to
memorize over the years.

04:53.360 --> 04:54.693
Hey, look where we are.

04:54.695 --> 04:56.728
CLEVELAND JR.:
Wait a minute.

04:56.730 --> 04:58.497
What are we doing
in Virginia?

04:58.499 --> 05:00.399
I have a surprise
for you, Cleveland Jr.

05:00.401 --> 05:03.769
We're gonna stop off for a day
or two in my old hometown.

05:03.771 --> 05:06.438
Okay, but we're out
of sandwich cookies.

05:06.440 --> 05:08.674
Nutter Butters and
the Oreos gone?!

05:08.676 --> 05:10.309
Damn!

05:12.879 --> 05:16.415
There used to be so much
hot fur walkin' around here.

05:16.417 --> 05:19.818
Nowadays, the way the ladies
are all grooming themselves,

05:19.820 --> 05:21.953
I don't even know
what you'd call it.

05:21.955 --> 05:22.988
I guess you'd say

05:22.990 --> 05:26.425
there's so much hot area
of skin walkin' around here.

05:26.427 --> 05:28.160
I'm glad I grew up when I did.

05:28.162 --> 05:30.395
Where's all your
baseball trophies?

05:30.397 --> 05:34.499
Hmm. Looks like they
moved the trophy case.

05:34.501 --> 05:35.567
(typing)

05:35.569 --> 05:39.771
Beg pardon, could you tell me
where the trophy case...?

05:39.773 --> 05:41.506
Cleveland?

05:41.508 --> 05:42.841
Donna?

05:42.843 --> 05:43.875
♪

05:43.877 --> 05:47.112
Thanks for driving me
to the dance, Cleveland.

05:47.114 --> 05:48.480
Robert would've
brought me himself,

05:48.482 --> 05:50.982
but he wanted to get drunk
with his friends first.

05:50.984 --> 05:53.018
It's all right,
I enjoy your company.

05:53.020 --> 05:55.454
I don't know why
you're with that guy.

05:55.456 --> 05:56.655
He don't treat you right.

05:56.657 --> 05:58.423
Oh, he's not so bad.

05:58.425 --> 05:59.591
Well, I think he is.

05:59.593 --> 06:03.995
And I just want you to know
that I think you're great.

06:03.997 --> 06:06.631
You're wonderful, Donna.

06:06.633 --> 06:07.599
I love--

06:07.601 --> 06:08.734
There you are, baby.

06:08.736 --> 06:11.436
Thanks for keeping her
warm for me, doughboy.

06:11.438 --> 06:12.537
Donna, come on over here

06:12.539 --> 06:15.474
and show my buddies
your nice fat ass.

06:15.476 --> 06:16.575
BOYS:
Ooh!
Yeah!

06:16.577 --> 06:18.877
Dang!
That's a nice
fat ass.

06:18.879 --> 06:22.013
So, you working here
at the old school?

06:22.015 --> 06:23.882
Yeah, I work for
the principal.

06:23.884 --> 06:25.584
How long you
in town for?

06:25.586 --> 06:26.651
Couple of days.

06:26.653 --> 06:28.253
On our way to California.

06:28.255 --> 06:30.889
Well, if you need
a place to stay,

06:30.891 --> 06:32.524
we have a spare room
at our house.

06:32.526 --> 06:34.059
But what would
Robert think?

06:34.061 --> 06:37.796
Oh, Cleveland, there
is no Robert anymore.

06:37.798 --> 06:39.598
We're divorced.

06:39.966 --> 06:43.568
I guess there is still some
hot fur around here.

06:43.570 --> 06:46.538
I guess there is.
(laughing)

06:46.540 --> 06:48.440
I guess there is.

06:53.012 --> 06:55.480
Back in high school,
I would have killed

06:55.482 --> 06:58.016
to spend the night
at Donna Tubbs' house.

06:58.018 --> 06:58.884
Wait a minute, Dad.

06:58.886 --> 07:00.786
Is she the one you used
to look at naked

07:00.788 --> 07:02.654
through her bedroom
window from the ladder

07:02.656 --> 07:04.790
when you used to...?
(loudly clearing throat)

07:04.792 --> 07:07.626
I don't even know why
I told you about that.

07:07.628 --> 07:09.628
"Oh I can keep
a secret, Daddy!"

07:09.630 --> 07:10.595
(gunshot)

07:10.597 --> 07:12.230
You all right, Donna?

07:12.232 --> 07:13.832
Yes, Lester. Why?

07:13.834 --> 07:16.101
There's a couple of
black guys followin' ya.

07:16.103 --> 07:18.637
Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot.
You're also black.

07:18.639 --> 07:19.671
(chuckles)

07:19.673 --> 07:20.972
Have a good day, then.

07:20.974 --> 07:23.675
Well, I guess I'm
back in the South.

07:24.677 --> 07:26.711
89! 43 on the back.

07:26.713 --> 07:28.447
And the greens were fast.

07:28.449 --> 07:30.615
I know, I read
your Twitter.

07:30.617 --> 07:32.918
Holt, this is my
friend, Cleveland.

07:32.920 --> 07:34.920
'Sup, dawg?

07:35.555 --> 07:36.555
(imitating explosion)

07:36.557 --> 07:37.889
You gotta blow
it up, brah!

07:37.891 --> 07:39.257
WOMAN:
Holt!
What, Mom?!

07:39.259 --> 07:40.525
It's time
for dinner!

07:40.527 --> 07:42.627
I'm talking
to my friends!

07:42.629 --> 07:44.529
I gotta go get my grub on.

07:44.531 --> 07:45.564
I'll come by later.

07:45.566 --> 07:46.698
Bring the new Dave.

07:46.700 --> 07:49.034
<i>Live in Austin. Sick.</i>

07:49.036 --> 07:51.102
He's a funny little man.

07:51.104 --> 07:53.038
(laughing)

07:53.040 --> 07:55.774
Rallo, this is Cleveland
and Cleveland Jr.

07:55.776 --> 07:58.643
They're gonna be our
guests for a couple nights.

07:58.645 --> 07:59.544
Oh, okay.

07:59.546 --> 08:01.646
We're having fat people
stay at our house now

08:01.648 --> 08:03.248
and nobody runs it by me?

08:03.250 --> 08:04.749
Watch your mouth, Rallo.

08:04.751 --> 08:05.817
Roberta!

08:05.819 --> 08:07.285
Where's your sister?

08:07.287 --> 08:08.487
She left.

08:08.489 --> 08:09.688
And left you alone?!

08:09.690 --> 08:10.722
Evidently.

08:10.724 --> 08:13.091
Hey, I ain't got to go
to school no more.

08:13.093 --> 08:15.560
Rallo got kicked out.

08:15.562 --> 08:17.162
He pulled down
the teacher's pants.

08:17.164 --> 08:19.598
I misread a signal. It happens.

08:19.600 --> 08:22.634
Honey, go show Cleveland Jr.
upstairs to the guest room.

08:22.636 --> 08:24.569
We ain't got no
freight elevator.

08:24.571 --> 08:25.136
(laughing)

08:25.138 --> 08:28.006
Nah, you're all right
with me, chubbs.

08:28.008 --> 08:28.840
Come on.

08:28.842 --> 08:30.175
That one gets
kicked out of school,

08:30.177 --> 08:32.677
and his sister-- who's supposed
to be watching him--

08:32.679 --> 08:33.812
is probably running around

08:33.814 --> 08:36.147
with her no-good boyfriend,
Federline Jones.

08:36.149 --> 08:39.050
Hard to believe a daughter
of yours would be attracted

08:39.052 --> 08:41.253
to a boy who was
no good for her.

08:41.255 --> 08:42.187
25 years later,

08:42.189 --> 08:44.723
and you still giving me guff
about Robert?!

08:44.725 --> 08:46.324
You need to get laid, fool.

08:46.326 --> 08:48.994
Oh, Mom, thank
God you're home.

08:48.996 --> 08:50.195
Rallo probably
already told you.

08:50.197 --> 08:53.031
I was going to the library
to get him some new books.

08:53.033 --> 08:57.269
But on the way, I was mugged
by six Al-Qaedas, and I said,

08:57.271 --> 08:59.137
"Oh no, you don't, Al-Qaedas!"

08:59.139 --> 09:02.307
And I fought 'em off,
one by one.

09:02.309 --> 09:04.643
I fought off six Al-Qaedas.

09:04.645 --> 09:06.044
Oh, please, Roberta.

09:06.046 --> 09:07.345
That's less convincing
than the time

09:07.347 --> 09:10.815
I had to use the bathroom
at R. Kelly's house.

09:14.687 --> 09:17.989
Uh, flush...

09:19.625 --> 09:22.661
So Coach Torre's office
said they'd reimburse me

09:22.663 --> 09:24.663
for the mileage on
the way out there.

09:24.665 --> 09:26.698
And with gas
prices these days--

09:26.700 --> 09:28.767
write your own
punch line.

09:28.769 --> 09:30.702
(laughing)

09:30.704 --> 09:31.770
Gas costs a lot.

09:31.772 --> 09:32.704
(laughing)

09:32.706 --> 09:34.205
He gets what
I'm talking about.

09:34.207 --> 09:36.174
I gotta go get ready
for Federline.

09:36.176 --> 09:37.909
It's a school night.

09:37.911 --> 09:39.678
We're studying, Mom.

09:39.680 --> 09:41.179
Studying a wiener.

09:41.181 --> 09:42.113
Rallo! Oh!

09:42.115 --> 09:44.349
I swear, my kids need
some fatherin'.

09:44.351 --> 09:45.884
Tell you what--
I'll get 'em

09:45.886 --> 09:49.688
on the right track
before I leave for California.

09:49.690 --> 09:50.855
(horn honking)

09:50.857 --> 09:51.923
Be back by 10:00.

09:51.925 --> 09:54.793
I'll be back whenever I want.

09:55.194 --> 09:57.929
Roberta, can I talk
to you for a moment?

09:57.931 --> 09:59.831
No. You get on my nerves.

09:59.833 --> 10:02.233
Like when white people
make a TV show

10:02.235 --> 10:04.269
they think black
people will watch.

10:04.271 --> 10:06.304
ANNOUNCER:
We now return to...

10:08.708 --> 10:09.941
What are you kids doin'?

10:09.943 --> 10:12.377
The church costume
party is tomorrow.

10:12.379 --> 10:15.380
Dat's what I was
tellin' you before!

10:15.382 --> 10:18.116
(canned laughter)

10:19.251 --> 10:21.820
I was like, come on...
You Federline Jones?

10:21.822 --> 10:24.756
I don't need my windows
washed, old man.

10:24.758 --> 10:27.192
Get 'em my demo,
know what I'm sayin'?

10:27.194 --> 10:30.195
I wasn't offering
to wash your windows.

10:30.197 --> 10:31.896
Do you see a spray bottle?

10:31.898 --> 10:32.764
No.

10:32.766 --> 10:34.899
Do you see a squeegee
or a chamois cloth

10:34.901 --> 10:37.669
or even a piece of
balled-up newspaper?

10:37.671 --> 10:37.936
No!

10:37.938 --> 10:41.706
How would I wash your
windows without those things?

10:41.708 --> 10:42.807
It would be impossible

10:42.809 --> 10:45.744
to wash your windows
without those things.

10:45.746 --> 10:46.411
Okay.

10:46.413 --> 10:49.214
Now, if you wanted me
to check your spark plugs,

10:49.216 --> 10:52.183
maybe I could do that,
because all I would need

10:52.185 --> 10:54.052
is for you to
pop the hood!

10:54.054 --> 10:56.788
But that's not why
I came out here.

10:56.790 --> 10:58.256
Now, there's a lady inside

10:58.258 --> 11:01.426
who you're going to
bring home at 10:00.

11:01.428 --> 11:03.194
Not 10:01.

11:03.196 --> 11:04.462
Not 9:59.

11:04.464 --> 11:07.899
Because that might be
too soon, as I'm hoping

11:07.901 --> 11:10.201
to get in a bit of
petting, myself, tonight.

11:10.203 --> 11:13.838
I don't know why I'm telling
you this, but it's true!

11:13.840 --> 11:16.174
I want it because
it feels good!

11:16.176 --> 11:19.044
Damn, I've put a lot
of time into this one,

11:19.046 --> 11:21.880
and I'm not going to
let you mess it all up

11:21.882 --> 11:23.982
by coming home at 9:59.

11:23.984 --> 11:26.785
So, what time you
gonna bring her home?

11:26.787 --> 11:27.919
10:00.

11:27.921 --> 11:29.454
Great. Have fun, kids.

11:29.456 --> 11:31.823
Don't drink too many sodas.
(laughing)

11:31.825 --> 11:36.428
You really showed
that kid who's boss, huh?

11:36.430 --> 11:37.796
Ah! A bear!

11:37.798 --> 11:39.497
Ah! A black man! Ah!

11:39.499 --> 11:42.300
You see? That doesn't
feel so good, does it?

11:42.302 --> 11:43.368
It's very reductive.

11:43.370 --> 11:46.404
Well, when it... Anyway...
Don't worry about it.

11:46.406 --> 11:47.906
You must be Cleveland.

11:47.908 --> 11:48.907
Wh-Who are you?

11:48.909 --> 11:50.408
I'm Donna's neighbor, Tim.

11:50.410 --> 11:53.478
My-My wife and our son,
Raymond, live... live here

11:53.480 --> 11:54.479
in this house right here.

11:54.481 --> 11:56.781
Aren't you supposed
to live in the woods?

11:56.783 --> 11:58.316
Oh, yeah, I suppose.

11:58.318 --> 12:00.418
It's, uh, it's not
the best place

12:00.420 --> 12:02.921
to make a buck in
today's, uh, world.

12:02.923 --> 12:05.056
You know, the rat race.

12:05.058 --> 12:06.491
I know, right?

12:06.493 --> 12:09.961
Tim, for heaven's sake,
how long does it take

12:09.963 --> 12:11.229
to take out the trash?

12:11.231 --> 12:12.897
Stop playing
with that man.

12:12.899 --> 12:16.101
Either eat him
or come inside.

12:16.103 --> 12:16.935
(sighs)

12:16.937 --> 12:18.236
Hey, do me a favor, right?

12:18.238 --> 12:20.371
Don't-Don't tell the
missus about this.

12:20.373 --> 12:24.876
She'd have my head over the
mantle if she found out.

12:24.878 --> 12:25.977
(sighs)

12:25.979 --> 12:28.913
Man, that's-that's the antidote
right there, let me tell you.

12:28.915 --> 12:33.151
Okay, well, may the peace of,
uh, Jesus Christ be with you.

12:33.153 --> 12:34.953
All right, then.

12:36.255 --> 12:37.155
(sighs)

12:37.157 --> 12:39.190
I don't trust that
Federline Jones.

12:39.192 --> 12:40.959
And I don't trust
Roberta, either.

12:40.961 --> 12:42.560
But I don't
know what to do.

12:42.562 --> 12:45.230
Have you considered
genital mutilation?

12:45.232 --> 12:46.297
What?!

12:46.299 --> 12:47.866
(laughing)
I'm just kidding.

12:47.868 --> 12:49.134
(both laughing)

12:49.136 --> 12:51.236
You so stupid.

12:51.238 --> 12:52.537
(laughing)

12:52.539 --> 12:53.238
(sighs)

12:53.240 --> 12:56.841
Cleveland, do you remember that
song you used to sing to me?

12:56.843 --> 12:58.309
Sing it to me again!

12:58.311 --> 12:59.477
No...

12:59.479 --> 13:00.478
Come on.

13:00.480 --> 13:01.446
I don't remember it.

13:01.448 --> 13:03.181
♪ Oh, Donna
♪ Oh, Cleveland

13:03.183 --> 13:05.150
♪ You're so fine, you're so
fine, you blow my mind ♪

13:05.152 --> 13:06.584
♪ Hey, Donna
♪ Hey, Cleveland

13:06.586 --> 13:08.153
♪ Hey, Donna
♪ Hey, Cleveland

13:08.155 --> 13:09.888
♪ Oh, Donna
♪ Hey, Cleveland

13:09.890 --> 13:11.156
♪ What a pity,
you don't understand ♪

13:11.158 --> 13:14.893
♪ You take me by the heart
when you take me by the hand. ♪

13:14.895 --> 13:16.628
(both laughing hysterically)

13:16.630 --> 13:17.996
(Cleveland sighs)

13:17.998 --> 13:19.497
Oh. Mmm...

13:19.999 --> 13:21.866
Do you know what time it is?!

13:21.868 --> 13:23.902
It's... 10:00.

13:23.904 --> 13:26.404
Damn, I should've
told him 10:04.

13:26.406 --> 13:30.175
Federline insisted
I be home on time.

13:30.177 --> 13:33.311
And tomorrow I'm getting
Rallo back in school.

13:33.313 --> 13:35.480
You've got a man
in the house now.

13:35.482 --> 13:38.483
Mmm, been a long time.

13:38.485 --> 13:40.418
RALLO:
She's lying!

13:41.887 --> 13:44.522
Thank you for giving Rallo
another chance,

13:44.524 --> 13:45.857
Mrs. Lowenstein.

13:45.859 --> 13:47.592
May I call you Hadassah?

13:47.594 --> 13:49.260
Ochay.

13:49.262 --> 13:50.795
Now, remember,
I'm not trying

13:50.797 --> 13:52.564
to stop you from
being who you are.

13:52.566 --> 13:54.132
You just got to
be cool about it.

13:54.134 --> 13:55.867
So, what are you going
to do when you want

13:55.869 --> 13:58.403
to go under the table to
look up someone's skirt?

13:58.405 --> 13:59.504
Create another reason

13:59.506 --> 14:02.240
for why I would be
going under the table.

14:02.242 --> 14:03.374
That's right.

14:03.376 --> 14:05.443
Now, go do your thing.

14:06.045 --> 14:07.946
Hey, ladies.

14:07.948 --> 14:10.348
Oops. I dropped my pencil.

14:10.350 --> 14:13.451
I wonder
where that pencil has gone.

14:13.453 --> 14:16.054
It is a most elusive pencil.

14:16.056 --> 14:19.991
One wonders
if I ever will find it.

14:19.993 --> 14:21.492
Attaboy.

14:21.494 --> 14:22.327
Speaking of pencils,

14:22.329 --> 14:25.330
I got a golf pencil
in my pants right now.

14:25.332 --> 14:27.966
(laughing)
Oh.

14:29.034 --> 14:31.236
I can't believe you
did it, Cleveland.

14:31.238 --> 14:32.670
Thank you so much.

14:32.672 --> 14:34.272
You know what
you proved to me?

14:34.274 --> 14:37.408
That these kids need
a man in their lives.

14:37.410 --> 14:40.311
And that I need a
man in my life.

14:40.313 --> 14:41.779
Who'd you have in mind?

14:41.781 --> 14:44.115
Who do you think, doughboy?

14:44.117 --> 14:45.016
Robert?!

14:45.018 --> 14:46.084
I owe it to the children

14:46.086 --> 14:48.019
to see if we can
make it work.

14:48.021 --> 14:49.754
You showed me that.

14:49.756 --> 14:50.788
(burps loudly)

14:50.790 --> 14:51.656
Come on, baby.

14:51.658 --> 14:53.124
Let's go down
to Woolworth's.

14:53.126 --> 14:56.127
I'll buy you a grilled
cheese and a parakeet.

14:56.129 --> 14:57.095
(laughing)

14:57.097 --> 14:59.063
We're not
getting a parakeet.

14:59.065 --> 15:01.065
I'd get you one
if you wanted it.

15:01.067 --> 15:03.067
Oh, Robert.

15:03.069 --> 15:05.003
Thanks, Cleveland.

15:05.005 --> 15:06.437
(both laughing)

15:07.239 --> 15:10.541
Oh, it can't
get any worse than this.

15:10.543 --> 15:14.412
CLEVELAND JR.: Daddy,
can you come wipe me?

15:14.414 --> 15:16.080
Oh...

15:20.219 --> 15:22.420
(chirping)

15:25.491 --> 15:27.525
What should we name
our new bird?

15:27.527 --> 15:30.194
Is it a boy or a girl?
It's a girl.

15:30.196 --> 15:32.130
Joan. Her name is Joan.

15:32.132 --> 15:36.134
Dad, do you think Uncle Robert
would get us a bird, as well?

15:36.136 --> 15:38.303
Hmm, no time for that,
Cleveland Jr.

15:38.305 --> 15:40.238
We're leaving first
thing in the morning.

15:40.240 --> 15:42.573
What? Then I'll cancel
dinner with Robert.

15:42.575 --> 15:44.042
I shouldn't be gone
your last night.

15:44.044 --> 15:47.412
No, I'll just do my thing,
and you can do your thing,

15:47.414 --> 15:50.381
which probably
involves Robert's thing.

15:50.383 --> 15:51.582
And your thing.

15:51.584 --> 15:54.285
Oh, which way's
the bar, Thing?

15:54.287 --> 15:56.988
(foghorn blows)

15:59.191 --> 16:02.293
So, you're-you're leaving
soon for California, eh?

16:02.295 --> 16:04.996
I ho... I hope you packed
your liberal shoes.

16:04.998 --> 16:06.631
What with their
electric cars

16:06.633 --> 16:08.967
and the Regal Beagle
and all, you know?

16:08.969 --> 16:10.068
Yep, heading out tomorrow.

16:10.070 --> 16:14.038
It's not like there's anything
to keep me here in Stoolbend.

16:14.040 --> 16:16.307
Certainly not Donna.

16:16.309 --> 16:18.343
Oh, I know how
to read a person.

16:18.345 --> 16:21.679
I can tell, you're sweet
on Donna, aren't you?

16:21.681 --> 16:23.581
No.
You are!

16:23.583 --> 16:25.750
You'd give up baseball
for a woman

16:25.752 --> 16:28.219
who's already busted
out two children

16:28.221 --> 16:29.821
out of her tween-leg area?!

16:29.823 --> 16:32.457
No! And even if
I wanted to, I couldn't.

16:32.459 --> 16:34.125
Her ex is back
in the picture.

16:34.127 --> 16:37.395
Oh, not Robert! He's
a terrible listener.

16:37.397 --> 16:38.363
He busted my Gameboy.

16:38.365 --> 16:40.498
Robert stole my lighter.
My good Bic.

16:40.500 --> 16:43.234
Well, he's taking her
to dinner tonight.

16:43.236 --> 16:44.135
(exhales)

16:44.137 --> 16:46.337
Anyway,
nice knowing you guys.

16:46.339 --> 16:48.539
I got some packing to do.

16:48.541 --> 16:50.608
Well, we can't
just let him go.

16:50.610 --> 16:52.210
Cleveland, wait!
Yes?

16:52.212 --> 16:55.146
You owe us like $8.50
for your drinks, man.

16:55.148 --> 16:57.882
$8.50 for two
peach schnappses?!

16:57.884 --> 16:58.683
Oh...

16:58.685 --> 17:00.585
Cleveland seemed
really sad.

17:00.587 --> 17:04.489
Yeah, I thought
they just got more pissed off.

17:05.557 --> 17:08.793
Wait! You said you weren't
leaving till tomorrow.

17:08.795 --> 17:10.128
I thought we'd
get a head start

17:10.130 --> 17:11.796
so we could do
a little sight-seeing.

17:11.798 --> 17:15.099
Maybe check out
Dolly Parton's birthplace.

17:15.101 --> 17:16.768
(crying)

17:16.770 --> 17:17.602
(chuckles)

17:17.604 --> 17:19.203
I guess she could
nurse herself, huh?

17:19.205 --> 17:22.240
Stop it, Bob.
This is a real problem!

17:22.242 --> 17:24.809
So, this is good-bye, then.

17:24.811 --> 17:27.845
You're a very lucky boy
to have this father.

17:27.847 --> 17:32.550
I can't think of a finer man
than Cleveland Brown.

17:32.552 --> 17:35.086
Good-bye, Donna.

17:38.524 --> 17:43.294
RALLO:
Oh, I know y'all ain't leaving
without making these beds!

17:48.200 --> 17:50.368
Are we gonna have
a pool in California?

17:50.370 --> 17:53.371
We'll try. We'll see what
amenities they have for us

17:53.373 --> 17:54.839
when we get there.

17:54.841 --> 17:59.210
In our kitchen, will our freezer
be on top of the fridge,

17:59.212 --> 18:00.611
or will they be
side by side?

18:00.613 --> 18:01.979
Or will it
be one of those

18:01.981 --> 18:03.714
that has the freezer
on the bottom--

18:03.716 --> 18:05.249
I don't know!

18:05.251 --> 18:06.584
I thought
pursuing your dreams

18:06.586 --> 18:08.619
was supposed
to make you happy,

18:08.621 --> 18:11.422
not a big douche.

18:11.424 --> 18:13.257
I'm sorry, Cleveland Jr.

18:13.259 --> 18:16.627
Dad, didn't you
tell me that sometimes

18:16.629 --> 18:18.463
you got to
take chances in life

18:18.465 --> 18:20.364
to find true happiness?
I did.

18:20.366 --> 18:23.968
Well, then, what are we doing
driving to California?

18:23.970 --> 18:26.604
Miss Donna's back in Stoolbend.

18:29.408 --> 18:33.444
(tires squealing)

18:33.446 --> 18:34.545
(quacking)

18:34.547 --> 18:37.281
CLEVELAND:
Oh, look at the little one!

18:40.986 --> 18:43.488
Oh, baby, it
feels so right

18:43.490 --> 18:45.890
to be back in this
house with you,

18:45.892 --> 18:47.592
the cable TV...

18:47.594 --> 18:48.392
Excuse me?

18:48.394 --> 18:51.395
Donna, I got
something to say!

18:51.397 --> 18:51.896
Cleveland?

18:51.898 --> 18:53.498
You're too good
for this man.

18:53.500 --> 18:57.201
Who are you, coming in here,
talking all kinds of trash?

18:57.203 --> 18:59.704
Who am I?
I'm someone who wants more

18:59.706 --> 19:01.606
than just a booty call.

19:01.608 --> 19:04.542
I'm someone who would
treat this lady right

19:04.544 --> 19:07.078
and be a good father
to her children.

19:07.080 --> 19:09.213
Her children?
My children.

19:09.215 --> 19:11.149
Do you even know
what grades they're in?

19:11.151 --> 19:14.218
The girl must be done
with high school, right?

19:14.220 --> 19:16.287
And Rerun's in what?

19:16.289 --> 19:16.888
Sixth grade?

19:16.890 --> 19:20.558
Donna, I don't want to go
to California anymore.

19:20.560 --> 19:22.727
But what about your dream?

19:22.729 --> 19:23.928
You're my dream.

19:23.930 --> 19:25.830
You always have been.

19:25.832 --> 19:29.634
♪

19:52.624 --> 19:57.395
♪

20:14.513 --> 20:16.514
♪

20:16.516 --> 20:18.416
I love you, Donna Tubbs.

20:18.418 --> 20:20.918
I have been
waiting 25 years

20:20.920 --> 20:24.288
to hear you say that,
Cleveland Brown.

20:24.290 --> 20:26.123
I love you, too.

20:26.125 --> 20:27.425
(sighs)

20:28.360 --> 20:29.460
Hear that, chump?

20:29.462 --> 20:31.963
This nice fat ass
is mine.

20:31.965 --> 20:34.432
You ain't seen the last of me!

20:34.434 --> 20:35.333
Joan!

20:35.335 --> 20:36.767
Say, bird,
let's rip this joint.

20:36.769 --> 20:40.271
These is just a couple
of jive-ass turkeys, anyhow.

20:40.273 --> 20:43.040
Dat's what I was
tellin' you before!

20:43.042 --> 20:44.809
(canned laughter)

20:44.811 --> 20:47.278
(church bells ringing)

20:49.781 --> 20:54.752
I present Mr. and Mrs.
Cleveland Brown.

20:55.721 --> 20:59.090
Y'all okay with having a
black guy as our fourth friend?

20:59.092 --> 21:00.258
I mean...
you know.

21:00.260 --> 21:01.425
Hey, we got
a black president.

21:01.427 --> 21:03.894
It's about time
we had a black friend.

21:03.896 --> 21:06.631
Hey, we can talk
to him about the president.

21:06.633 --> 21:08.599
Well, I may not be
a baseball scout,

21:08.601 --> 21:11.569
but I think
I just hit a home run.

21:11.571 --> 21:12.503
Me, too.

21:12.505 --> 21:14.305
You know, I
guess I could

21:14.307 --> 21:15.673
get used to having
a dad again.

21:15.675 --> 21:18.409
And I could get used to
having a brother and sister.

21:18.411 --> 21:21.445
Well, if we ain't the
black Brady Bunch.

21:21.447 --> 21:23.481
Except I'm
not a gay architect

21:23.483 --> 21:26.417
and my wife's not
sleeping with my son!

21:26.419 --> 21:28.519
(all laughing)

21:28.521 --> 21:29.620
Not yet.

21:29.622 --> 21:32.123
(all laughing)
