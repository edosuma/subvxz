** On God...

00:26.927 --> 00:28.329
You sure
this is his place?

00:30.131 --> 00:33.101
According to his
student record,
this is it.

00:33.234 --> 00:34.235
Then who is that?

00:34.368 --> 00:36.870
I'm guessing his roommate.

00:37.004 --> 00:39.307
I'll go say hello.
You check the bedrooms.

00:39.440 --> 00:41.675
** It's all on me here,

** Everything flawless,

00:45.513 --> 00:46.547
Whoa! What the...

00:46.680 --> 00:48.649
(CHUCKLING)
I'm sorry to startle.

00:48.782 --> 00:50.818
We're looking for
Andrew Kennison.

00:50.951 --> 00:52.453
Who the hell are you?
How did you get in here?
Shh.

00:53.087 --> 00:54.388
I should clarify.

00:54.522 --> 00:55.856
I'm not
taking questions.

00:57.991 --> 00:59.093
That's unfortunate.

00:59.227 --> 01:00.828
What's your name?
Marcus.

01:00.961 --> 01:02.496
Marcus. Relax.

01:02.630 --> 01:04.665
Our business
is with Andrew.
Andrew's not here.

01:04.798 --> 01:05.999
You're his roommate?

01:06.134 --> 01:07.535
Yes. We're in the same
graduate program.

01:07.668 --> 01:10.838
Ah. Then you must be
a smart young fellow,
Marcus.

01:10.971 --> 01:12.706
Smart enough to tell us
where Andrew is now.

01:12.840 --> 01:14.308
But I don't know.

01:14.442 --> 01:15.709
When do you
expect him back?

01:15.843 --> 01:17.845
I don't know that either.
Andrew's missing.

01:17.978 --> 01:19.147
Missing?

01:19.280 --> 01:20.714
It's been a few weeks.

01:20.848 --> 01:22.916
He left to go to the library
at 5:00 p.m. to study.

01:23.050 --> 01:24.585
We had a Phys-Chem final
the next day.

01:24.718 --> 01:26.754
He never came home.
Nobody knows where he is.

01:29.990 --> 01:32.860
Andrew, please
try to understand.

01:32.993 --> 01:34.862
How can I understand
when you haven't given me
any information?

01:34.995 --> 01:37.731
I've told you what I can.
You've told me nothing.

01:37.865 --> 01:40.067
That my life is in danger?
What does that even mean?

01:40.201 --> 01:41.535
I mean, if someone's
threatening me,

01:41.669 --> 01:42.870
I-I deserve to know...

01:43.003 --> 01:44.872
And I've tried to explain.
I can't tell you more

01:45.005 --> 01:47.275
without compromising
a federal investigation.

01:47.408 --> 01:51.111
Mr. Kennison, I came
when the Marshals called
because I know you're upset.

01:51.245 --> 01:53.681
I didn't get to say
goodbye to anyone.

01:53.814 --> 01:55.249
My wife suffers
from mental illness.

01:55.383 --> 01:56.917
She's in a facility
in Bethesda.

01:57.050 --> 01:58.719
I'm finishing
my graduate degree.

01:58.852 --> 02:00.321
I'm missing classes and exams.

02:00.454 --> 02:02.556
I'm aware,
and I'm sorry,

02:02.690 --> 02:05.293
but keeping you safe
is the Bureau's
primary concern.

02:05.426 --> 02:07.628
How long? How long do
I have to stay here?

02:07.761 --> 02:10.464
I don't know.
We're still investigating.

02:10.598 --> 02:12.300
My hope is that we can have
a quick breakthrough,

02:12.433 --> 02:13.901
get you home very soon.

02:14.034 --> 02:14.802
It's not good enough.

02:16.304 --> 02:17.104
I'm not under arrest.

02:17.238 --> 02:18.439
What if I want a lawyer?

02:18.572 --> 02:20.140
What if I just leave?

02:20.274 --> 02:21.975
We won't stop you.

02:22.109 --> 02:24.077
But then again,
we won't be able
to protect you.

02:24.212 --> 02:26.314
I'm asking you
for more time.

02:26.447 --> 02:28.982
Believe me, I don't
want you to be here
for one second longer

02:29.116 --> 02:30.751
than is
absolutely necessary.

02:33.053 --> 02:35.656
****

02:40.628 --> 02:42.296
How'd it go
with Kennison?

02:42.430 --> 02:43.631
Not well.

02:43.764 --> 02:45.333
He's threatening to leave
protective custody.

02:45.466 --> 02:47.134
And you think
he'll do it?

02:47.268 --> 02:48.736
He's understandably upset.

02:48.869 --> 02:50.137
I bought us some time,
but if I don't tell him

02:50.271 --> 02:51.805
something soon,
he's gonna walk.

02:51.939 --> 02:53.374
Our conversation was consumed

02:53.507 --> 02:55.476
by confusion, anger, fear.

02:55.609 --> 02:56.744
His or yours?

02:56.877 --> 02:58.346
Both.

02:58.479 --> 03:00.681
This whole thing makes me
sick to my stomach.

03:00.814 --> 03:02.516
So, please tell me
you found something.

03:02.650 --> 03:03.984
You tell me.

03:04.117 --> 03:05.586
Our working theory is that

03:05.719 --> 03:06.820
whoever is blackmailing you

03:06.954 --> 03:08.155
is a New York City detective,

03:08.289 --> 03:09.290
but that's about

03:09.423 --> 03:10.991
5,200 suspects to start with.

03:11.124 --> 03:14.262
But of those, about 2,600
are white males,

03:14.395 --> 03:16.530
which is how
the bartender described him.

03:16.664 --> 03:18.232
How many
were working the night
Doug Koster was killed?

03:18.366 --> 03:21.602
1,400, which leaves about
1,200 names on that list.

03:21.735 --> 03:25.172
Now, it's a lot,
but odds are,

03:25.306 --> 03:28.576
one of the names on that list
is behind this.

03:28.709 --> 03:30.578
I'll take a look.
Maybe I'll recognize one.

03:30.711 --> 03:33.046
But if there's
an NYPD detective

03:33.180 --> 03:35.349
willing to frame me
for murder,

03:35.483 --> 03:37.050
I have no idea why.

03:37.184 --> 03:38.319
(GRUNTS)

03:38.452 --> 03:39.820
(CELL PHONE VIBRATES)

03:41.355 --> 03:42.356
I got Weecha's text.

03:42.490 --> 03:43.924
She said you have a case.

03:44.057 --> 03:46.394
I do.
Fine. Tell me where
and I'll come meet you.

03:46.527 --> 03:47.695
Not this time, Harold.

03:47.828 --> 03:49.363
Assemble the troops.
I'll come to you.

03:49.497 --> 03:50.998
Does that mean
you found something?

03:51.131 --> 03:53.801
(CLICK, DIAL TONE)

03:53.934 --> 03:56.270
REDDINGTON: You all know
we've been tracing the origins

03:56.404 --> 03:59.407
of this device
we recovered from Elizabeth.

03:59.540 --> 04:01.208
Have you figured out
who made the tracking device?

04:01.342 --> 04:03.411
I have. But it's not just
a tracking device.

04:03.544 --> 04:04.778
That's one of
its features,

04:04.912 --> 04:06.213
but it was designed

04:06.347 --> 04:07.348
to help people,

04:07.481 --> 04:08.982
not to stalk them.

04:09.116 --> 04:11.084
Who exactly was that thing
supposed to help?

04:11.218 --> 04:13.220
Patients. In this
particular case,

04:13.354 --> 04:16.890
those with certain severe
psychiatric disorders.

04:17.024 --> 04:20.093
It's both a delivery
and monitoring system.

04:20.227 --> 04:22.696
Its capsule is loaded
with medication,

04:22.830 --> 04:25.666
and as Aram
previously discussed,

04:25.799 --> 04:27.200
when it makes contact

04:27.335 --> 04:28.936
with the patient's
stomach acid,

04:29.069 --> 04:32.440
it sends a wireless signal
confirming compliance

04:32.573 --> 04:34.074
and the location
of the patient.

04:34.207 --> 04:35.208
To whom?

04:35.343 --> 04:36.877
Doctors.
Loved ones.

04:37.010 --> 04:38.712
Some patients have
trouble remembering

04:38.846 --> 04:40.614
if they've taken
their medication,

04:40.748 --> 04:42.650
or even where they are

04:42.783 --> 04:44.117
or where they
might be going.

04:44.251 --> 04:46.554
If we're talking about
the most severe disorders,

04:46.687 --> 04:48.221
skipping meds
can cause serious problems.

04:48.356 --> 04:49.623
It can.

04:49.757 --> 04:52.292
And in this case,
it did.

04:52.426 --> 04:54.795
Aram, Weecha
sent you a profile.

04:54.928 --> 04:57.030
Oh. Sent me an e-mail.

04:57.164 --> 04:58.566
(KEYBOARD CLACKS)

04:58.699 --> 05:01.034
REDDINGTON:
The designer's name
is Andrew Kennison.

05:01.168 --> 05:03.337
Several years ago,
his young wife,

05:03.471 --> 05:05.939
over the course
of multiple days,

05:06.073 --> 05:08.141
failed to take doses
of the powerful

05:08.275 --> 05:10.310
anti-psychotic medications

05:10.444 --> 05:12.112
that her doctors
had prescribed.

05:12.245 --> 05:15.148
The result was horrific
and tragic.

05:15.282 --> 05:17.685
She took the lives
of her sister and her mother

05:17.818 --> 05:20.253
when they came to stay
for a holiday visit.

05:20.388 --> 05:21.655
Oh, my God.

05:21.789 --> 05:24.758
Afterward, Andrew Kennison
went back to school,

05:24.892 --> 05:26.760
a graduate program
at MIT.

05:26.894 --> 05:29.663
He designed this,
hoping that it might prevent

05:29.797 --> 05:31.565
what happened
to his wife and family

05:31.699 --> 05:33.333
from ever happening again.

05:33.467 --> 05:34.735
So, it wasn't him?

05:34.868 --> 05:35.936
I mean,
he designed the device,

05:36.069 --> 05:37.971
but it sounds like
he has no connection to Liz.

05:38.105 --> 05:40.107
I don't know, Donald,
because I can't ask him.

05:40.240 --> 05:42.776
Why not?
We can just go get him.
You said he's at MIT.

05:42.910 --> 05:44.277
He's missing.
RESSLER: Since when?

05:44.412 --> 05:45.713
A few weeks.

05:45.846 --> 05:48.382
He left the school library
and hasn't been seen since.

05:48.516 --> 05:50.784
That's probably
not a coincidence.

05:50.918 --> 05:52.953
I agree. Which is why
Andrew Kennison

05:53.086 --> 05:54.988
is the next name
on the Blacklist.

05:55.122 --> 05:57.725
RESSLER: There's
a chance he's dead.
REDDINGTON: A good one, even.

05:57.858 --> 05:59.627
At this point, all we know
is that someone took him,

05:59.760 --> 06:01.495
someone who didn't
want him found,
and we need to know why.

06:01.629 --> 06:03.764
So, where do we start?

06:03.897 --> 06:06.767
His roommate reported him
missing to the Campus Police.

06:06.900 --> 06:09.236
They've been investigating
ever since. I'd start there.

06:11.104 --> 06:12.339
Harold?

06:12.473 --> 06:14.608
What?
You okay with that?

06:14.742 --> 06:17.678
Yeah. I mean,
yes, of course.

06:17.811 --> 06:19.346
Agent Ressler,
Agent Zuma,

06:19.480 --> 06:20.814
head on up
to Boston right away.

06:24.284 --> 06:25.252
Harold.

06:27.354 --> 06:29.990
I want you to know,
I realize

06:30.123 --> 06:32.926
how difficult
all this must be for you.

06:33.060 --> 06:34.962
You do?
Of course.

06:35.095 --> 06:37.197
I know how much
you loved Elizabeth,

06:37.330 --> 06:40.267
how hard it's been
to move forward.

06:40.400 --> 06:43.571
When I came back,
I knew what it meant
to go down this road.

06:43.704 --> 06:47.040
I knew what searching for
the truth might do to me.

06:47.174 --> 06:49.577
But I was so focused
on my own need,

06:49.710 --> 06:52.079
I didn't think enough about
what it might do to you.

06:52.980 --> 06:54.515
You're apologizing?
To me?

06:54.648 --> 06:56.984
Commiserating, really.

06:57.117 --> 06:58.919
We all want
the same thing.

06:59.052 --> 07:01.188
Closure. Accountability.

07:01.321 --> 07:02.255
And I'm confident

07:02.389 --> 07:04.758
that we will find
whoever did this,

07:04.892 --> 07:08.195
and when we do,
they will be the one
who is sorry.

Agents Ressler and Zuma?

07:24.144 --> 07:26.714
Ted Morrison. I'm the officer
assigned to the Kennison case.

07:26.847 --> 07:28.248
Thank you
for meeting with us.

07:28.381 --> 07:29.883
Are you kidding?
I've been trying to

07:30.017 --> 07:31.685
get ahold of someone
at the Bureau for a while.

07:31.819 --> 07:32.853
Thank you for
sharing information.

07:32.986 --> 07:34.254
RESSLER: I'm not
sure we follow.

07:34.387 --> 07:36.524
We're not here to, uh,
share information with you.

07:36.657 --> 07:38.391
We were hoping
you could update us
on your investigation.

07:39.226 --> 07:41.028
Update you? Okay.

07:41.161 --> 07:43.096
W-What's going on?
Is this some kind of joke?

07:43.230 --> 07:45.733
Hey, man, nobody's joking.
We're here to help.

07:45.866 --> 07:48.636
Okay. Well, these are
surveillance images

07:48.769 --> 07:51.038
from outside
the campus library.

07:51.171 --> 07:53.741
Andrew Kennison finished
studying at 10:00 p.m.

07:53.874 --> 07:54.875
When he exited
the building,

07:55.008 --> 07:56.710
he was confronted by
an unknown man.

07:56.844 --> 07:58.478
They spoke
for a few minutes,

07:58.612 --> 08:00.914
and then they both got
into that sedan and left.

08:01.048 --> 08:02.415
You run the plates
on the sedan?

08:02.550 --> 08:04.451
The first day.
And guess what?

08:04.585 --> 08:05.686
It's a federal vehicle.

08:05.819 --> 08:08.088
Registered to
the U.S. Marshals Service.

08:08.221 --> 08:10.123
I've been calling them
and the FBI for weeks

08:10.257 --> 08:11.559
to ask
what I'm dealing with.

08:11.692 --> 08:14.127
No one's gotten back to you.
Bureaucracy at its finest.

08:14.261 --> 08:15.863
Yeah, well,
now that you're here,

08:15.996 --> 08:18.331
I'm thinking the right hand
doesn't know what
the left hand is doing.

08:19.432 --> 08:20.500
Who the hell is that?

08:21.902 --> 08:23.937
You're not hearing me.
I'm saying it's connected.

08:24.071 --> 08:24.972
It's all connected.
LEW: I hear you.

08:25.105 --> 08:26.473
I'm just trying
to understand.

08:26.607 --> 08:28.542
Whoever killed Doug Koster,
whoever's blackmailing me,

08:28.676 --> 08:31.111
also wanted Andrew Kennison
to disappear. Why?

08:31.244 --> 08:32.646
Because Kennison
created the device

08:32.780 --> 08:33.647
that we found
in Elizabeth Keen.

08:33.781 --> 08:34.915
He must have information

08:35.048 --> 08:36.784
on who's responsible
for her death,

08:36.917 --> 08:38.285
details the killer
didn't want us to learn.

08:38.418 --> 08:39.452
Slow down.

08:39.587 --> 08:41.354
I didn't see it.

08:41.488 --> 08:44.224
Whoever targeted me
also targeted Elizabeth Keen.

08:44.357 --> 08:45.559
And I helped him.

08:45.693 --> 08:47.360
I disappeared the witness
who could help us

08:47.494 --> 08:50.297
find the person or people
who orchestrated her death.

08:50.430 --> 08:51.732
Harold, take a breath.

08:51.865 --> 08:53.901
Listen to me.
If you tell the truth now,

08:54.034 --> 08:55.969
there is a good chance

08:56.103 --> 08:57.537
that both of us
are going to prison.

08:59.106 --> 09:00.741
Harold?

09:00.874 --> 09:02.409
Harold.

09:04.111 --> 09:05.178
Harold!

09:09.516 --> 09:10.884
MARSHAL GWYNN: I'm sorry.
What exactly is the question?

09:11.018 --> 09:11.985
DEMBE: The vehicle.

09:12.119 --> 09:13.887
It's registered
to the Marshals Service.

09:14.021 --> 09:15.889
Yeah, it's one of ours.
Is there a problem?

09:16.023 --> 09:18.525
The problem is,
we're with a specialized
Bureau Task Force

09:18.659 --> 09:20.894
and we're looking
for a man by the name
of Andrew Kennison,

09:21.028 --> 09:22.295
and according
to these photos,

09:22.429 --> 09:23.597
he was last seen
getting into

09:23.731 --> 09:25.432
a Marshals Service vehicle
on the night he disappeared.

09:25.565 --> 09:26.667
Yeah, of course.

09:26.800 --> 09:28.201
Of course?

09:28.335 --> 09:30.537
Does that mean
he's in custody?

09:30.671 --> 09:34.007
Because we checked.
He has no criminal record.
He's not a fugitive.

09:34.141 --> 09:35.843
Fellas, I'm not sure
what's happening.

09:35.976 --> 09:37.344
Andrew Kennison is
in our custody

09:37.477 --> 09:39.179
because the Bureau
requested it.

09:39.312 --> 09:41.381
He's not a suspect,
he's a potential victim.

09:41.514 --> 09:42.750
Are you saying

09:42.883 --> 09:44.317
that he's in the
Witness Protection Program?

09:44.451 --> 09:45.919
Yeah, because his life
is in danger.

09:46.053 --> 09:47.387
What makes you
think that?

09:47.520 --> 09:49.389
Well, we didn't make
the assessment.
The Bureau did.

09:49.522 --> 09:50.858
And we're not
in the business of

09:50.991 --> 09:53.026
second-guessing an
Assistant Director
of the FBI.

09:56.429 --> 09:57.931
You're gonna have to
repeat that.

09:58.065 --> 09:59.833
You should talk
to Harold Cooper.

09:59.967 --> 10:01.334
He arranged
for WITSEC protection.

10:01.468 --> 10:02.535
That's not possible.

10:02.670 --> 10:03.937
That's a fact.

10:04.071 --> 10:05.839
He supervised
the transport.

10:05.973 --> 10:06.840
Hell, he met with
Kennison yesterday

10:06.974 --> 10:08.275
in one of
our safe houses.

10:11.879 --> 10:13.246
ARAM: You're saying...

10:13.380 --> 10:16.349
Wait. What exactly
are you saying?

10:16.483 --> 10:17.718
Kennison's in
Witness Protection

10:17.851 --> 10:19.953
because Cooper ordered it.
That's him in the photo.

10:20.087 --> 10:21.955
I don't understand.
Why would he do that?

10:22.089 --> 10:23.857
DEMBE: For the same reason
you put anyone in the program,

10:23.991 --> 10:25.558
you don't want them
to be found.

10:25.693 --> 10:27.394
Found by us?
Yes.

10:27.527 --> 10:28.762
And Raymond.

10:28.896 --> 10:30.397
You can't be serious.

10:30.530 --> 10:31.932
This isn't happening.

10:32.065 --> 10:34.835
It's hard to believe,
but I don't see any way
around the facts.

10:34.968 --> 10:36.569
RESSLER: Look,
let's just go back
to the beginning.

10:36.704 --> 10:37.971
What do we know?

10:38.105 --> 10:40.040
One, we think that someone
orchestrated Keen's death,

10:40.173 --> 10:41.842
someone who knew
that Vandyke would kill her

10:41.975 --> 10:44.444
and used him as a way
to get the job done
without exposing himself.

10:44.577 --> 10:45.879
Or herself.

10:46.013 --> 10:48.148
Two, we think that Kennison
may have information

10:48.281 --> 10:49.683
that could lead us
to the real killer,

10:49.817 --> 10:51.118
and now
we've learned that

10:51.251 --> 10:53.386
Cooper made sure
that Kennison disappeared.

10:53.520 --> 10:56.456
Because he didn't want us
to find out who killed Liz?

10:56.589 --> 10:58.792
Aram, hey, we need to take
emotion out of the equation.

10:58.926 --> 11:00.994
I cannot do this.
PARK: We can't
ignore the truth.

11:01.128 --> 11:02.662
Cooper knew
where Kennison was,

11:02.796 --> 11:04.197
and yet he stood there
and said nothing

11:04.331 --> 11:06.033
while Reddington
put his name
on the Blacklist.

11:06.166 --> 11:07.935
He sent us to Boston
to investigate.

11:08.068 --> 11:10.237
I mean, he intentionally
hid the truth from us.

11:10.370 --> 11:11.939
But there has to be
an explanation.

11:12.072 --> 11:13.506
I mean,
look at the timing.

11:13.640 --> 11:15.475
He put Kennison
in the program

11:15.608 --> 11:18.011
long before Mr. Reddington
knew who to look for.

11:18.145 --> 11:20.147
He did it after
we found the device,

11:20.280 --> 11:23.016
because he knew
once we did,
we'd go looking.

11:23.150 --> 11:25.585
So, what?
What, Mr. Cooper
wanted Liz dead?

11:26.653 --> 11:27.520
Say it.

11:30.991 --> 11:34.327
Be clear about
what you are suggesting.

11:34.461 --> 11:36.730
Mr. Cooper was working
with whoever killed Liz,

11:36.864 --> 11:38.866
and now he is protecting
whoever did it

11:38.999 --> 11:41.034
by lying to our faces?

11:41.168 --> 11:42.435
Aram, we're just looking
at the facts here.

11:43.670 --> 11:45.205
PARK: My question is,
what do we do?

11:45.338 --> 11:46.539
Go to Reddington?

11:46.673 --> 11:48.541
I mean, if Cooper
really is involved,

11:48.675 --> 11:49.877
who do we tell?
Panabaker?

11:50.010 --> 11:51.544
DEMBE: We could work
the case ourselves,

11:51.678 --> 11:53.246
try to confirm
if it's true.

11:53.380 --> 11:55.849
ARAM: You mean set a trap.
For Mr. Cooper.

11:55.983 --> 11:59.086
No. I am not doing it.
We are not doing it.

11:59.219 --> 12:01.254
There has to be
an explanation,

12:01.388 --> 12:04.224
and I am going to go up there
and ask him what it is.

12:04.357 --> 12:05.358
PARK: If he knows
we're onto him,

12:05.492 --> 12:06.860
it's gonna be a lot harder
to find the truth.

12:06.994 --> 12:08.495
ARAM: I don't care.

12:08.628 --> 12:11.031
I am not targeting Mr. Cooper

12:11.164 --> 12:12.532
behind his back.

12:14.234 --> 12:15.936
You know what?
Aram is right.

12:16.069 --> 12:17.670
We all love the guy,

12:17.805 --> 12:19.873
and God knows he deserves
every benefit of the doubt.

12:20.007 --> 12:23.176
****

12:26.046 --> 12:28.215
I should have told you.

12:28.348 --> 12:30.117
I'm not entirely sure
why I didn't.

12:30.250 --> 12:32.085
I've obstructed justice,

12:32.219 --> 12:34.587
tampered with
physical evidence,
lied to the police...

12:34.721 --> 12:37.157
Those may be the least
of your concerns, Harold.

12:37.290 --> 12:39.226
It's no defense,
but I want you to know,

12:39.359 --> 12:41.895
when I decided to put Kennison
into Witness Protection,

12:42.029 --> 12:43.496
I had no idea
he had any connection

12:43.630 --> 12:44.597
to Elizabeth's death.

12:44.731 --> 12:46.133
You run the Reddington
Task Force,

12:46.266 --> 12:47.801
and it never
occurred to you

12:47.935 --> 12:49.769
that perhaps you were
being targeted

12:49.903 --> 12:51.604
because of
your connection to me?

12:51.738 --> 12:53.306
Not at first.

12:53.440 --> 12:54.607
In the beginning,

12:54.741 --> 12:56.209
I didn't know I was
being targeted at all.

12:56.343 --> 12:58.345
Doug Koster,
my wife's ex-lover, was dead.

12:58.478 --> 13:00.513
I had no memory of
what happened that night.

13:00.647 --> 13:02.115
For a time,
I honestly believed

13:02.249 --> 13:03.783
it was possible
that I'd killed him.

13:03.917 --> 13:05.618
And you didn't think
I could help with that?

13:05.752 --> 13:07.120
I was frozen.

13:07.254 --> 13:09.222
I could barely admit
the truth to myself.

13:09.356 --> 13:10.790
But it wasn't the truth,
Harold.

13:10.924 --> 13:12.926
The minute you realized

13:13.060 --> 13:14.727
you were being blackmailed,

13:14.862 --> 13:16.964
I should've been
your first call.

13:17.097 --> 13:19.132
It wasn't that simple.

13:19.266 --> 13:20.633
By then, I'd gotten
Charlene involved.

13:20.767 --> 13:22.435
She lied to
the assigned detective,

13:22.569 --> 13:24.337
and my good friend,
Lew Sloan,

13:24.471 --> 13:26.639
had risked everything
by altering my service weapon.

13:26.773 --> 13:27.640
We're done here.

13:28.441 --> 13:29.910
I told you

13:30.043 --> 13:32.079
the day I agreed
to come back

13:32.212 --> 13:34.814
that whoever killed Elizabeth
would be held accountable.

13:34.948 --> 13:36.216
And I want that, too.

13:36.349 --> 13:38.218
Then tell me
where Kennison is.

13:38.351 --> 13:40.020
Where can I find him?

13:40.153 --> 13:42.122
He's at a safe house being
guarded by federal Marshals.

13:42.255 --> 13:43.190
Where?

13:43.323 --> 13:45.225
I won't tell you that.

13:45.358 --> 13:46.793
I'll have the Marshals
bring him in.

13:46.927 --> 13:48.028
We'll question him here.

13:48.161 --> 13:50.797
My sources run deep,
Harold.

13:50.931 --> 13:52.432
With or without you,

13:52.565 --> 13:55.002
I'll have his location
by the end of the day.

13:55.135 --> 13:56.603
I won't help you hurt him.

13:56.736 --> 13:58.671
(CHUCKLES) Whether
I hurt him or not

13:58.805 --> 14:00.773
has nothing to do
with your help.

14:00.908 --> 14:03.443
And I'm sorry
to say, Harold,

14:03.576 --> 14:05.979
you're the one
who needs help right now.

14:06.113 --> 14:08.115
****

14:18.325 --> 14:19.859
It was you.

14:19.993 --> 14:21.995
****

14:28.835 --> 14:30.137
I understand.

14:31.171 --> 14:32.305
There's no defense.

14:33.941 --> 14:36.643
I should have trusted you all,
told you everything the day

14:36.776 --> 14:39.512
I woke up in my car
and realized Doug Koster
was dead.

14:39.646 --> 14:41.014
So, this whole time,
you've been investigating

14:41.148 --> 14:42.215
who killed him
on your own?

14:42.349 --> 14:44.151
Not just Doug Koster,

14:44.284 --> 14:45.986
but the bartender who spiked
my drink that night.

14:46.987 --> 14:49.056
I wasn't entirely alone.

14:49.189 --> 14:50.390
Lew Sloan's been with me.

14:50.523 --> 14:52.025
I'm still trying
to understand.

14:52.159 --> 14:54.294
Someone framed you
for Doug Koster's murder?

14:54.427 --> 14:56.829
Yes. And it could
have worked.

14:56.964 --> 14:59.566
I woke up in my car
with no alibi
for that night.

14:59.699 --> 15:01.901
And your gun was
a match for the bullet
that killed him.

15:02.035 --> 15:03.736
So, whoever had you drugged
must have used it

15:03.870 --> 15:05.538
to kill Koster
while you were out.

15:05.672 --> 15:07.540
Knowing the police
would find it,
and they would have,

15:07.674 --> 15:09.076
if Lew Sloan hadn't
altered the barrel.

15:09.209 --> 15:10.510
Why would
somebody do this?

15:10.643 --> 15:12.245
At first,
I thought it was
just to get me,

15:12.379 --> 15:14.714
but now
we know it was more.

15:14.847 --> 15:17.650
Whoever's blackmailing me
is also connected
to Elizabeth's murder.

15:17.784 --> 15:19.886
I think the original plan
was to frame me

15:20.020 --> 15:21.588
as a way
to hurt Reddington

15:21.721 --> 15:23.523
by damaging one of
his most powerful weapons,

15:23.656 --> 15:24.992
this task force.

15:25.125 --> 15:27.160
So, whoever's behind this,
they know we exist.

15:27.294 --> 15:29.129
And when framing me
didn't work,

15:29.262 --> 15:31.731
the plan changed
to blackmail.

15:31.864 --> 15:34.567
To leverage me
as a way to stay one step
ahead of Reddington.

15:34.701 --> 15:37.104
By using you to do things
like hide Andrew Kennison.

15:37.237 --> 15:38.638
ARAM: So
Mr. Reddington's right.

15:38.771 --> 15:41.074
Vandyke pulled the trigger
that killed Liz,

15:41.208 --> 15:43.043
but someone else
was behind it.

15:43.176 --> 15:44.477
So, what now?

15:44.611 --> 15:47.380
I face the consequences
of my actions.

15:47.514 --> 15:49.382
I've called Panabaker.
She's on her way.

15:51.884 --> 15:53.620
I've had some low moments
these last few months.

15:55.422 --> 15:57.390
Maybe the worst
was asking
Charlene to lie.

15:58.658 --> 16:00.293
The idea that
I've involved her in this

16:00.427 --> 16:01.594
is almost more
than I can bear.

16:03.630 --> 16:04.964
But lying to you all...

16:07.700 --> 16:08.935
Whatever happens to me now,

16:09.069 --> 16:10.137
I deserve it.

16:10.270 --> 16:12.272
****

16:23.916 --> 16:25.152
How do you feel?

16:25.285 --> 16:26.919
How do I feel?

16:27.054 --> 16:29.122
I feel a sense
of inevitability.

16:31.191 --> 16:33.493
That it doesn't matter
what I want or do.

16:35.095 --> 16:36.463
The world is what it is.

16:38.365 --> 16:39.532
(GUN COCKS)

16:39.666 --> 16:41.434
The loss is permanent.

16:42.569 --> 16:44.271
Elizabeth
will always be dead.

16:45.638 --> 16:46.806
What do I feel?

16:48.708 --> 16:51.344
I'm concerned that I won't
be able to contain myself,

16:53.280 --> 16:57.450
that I still haven't seen
the worst of who I am.

17:00.120 --> 17:01.354
No, I don't think you have.

17:02.489 --> 17:04.457
****

17:09.729 --> 17:10.663
(DOOR OPENS)

17:12.132 --> 17:15.168
****

17:16.703 --> 17:18.971
I'm just saying,
when do I get to choose?

17:19.106 --> 17:20.640
Never.
Never?

17:20.773 --> 17:22.509
You guys are guarding me.

18:22.569 --> 18:24.237
You knew your weapon
had been fired,

18:24.371 --> 18:27.274
and because you ran
your own ballistics test,
thanks to your buddy,

18:27.407 --> 18:29.476
you knew it was a match
for the Koster murder?
Yes.

18:29.609 --> 18:31.311
You lied to
the assigned detective.

18:31.444 --> 18:33.946
You actively
concealed the match
by altering the gun.

18:34.080 --> 18:36.249
No. No, it was my friend
who did that.

Do you recognize it?

20:40.507 --> 20:42.074
Mm.

20:42.208 --> 20:45.745
It was recovered from
a former FBI agent
named Elizabeth Keen.

20:46.979 --> 20:48.180

who that is.

20:48.315 --> 20:51.418

You designed this?

20:58.525 --> 21:01.828
Yes. I-It's a medication

21:01.961 --> 21:04.230
I'm past what it is
and what it does.

21:04.364 --> 21:07.600
It clearly wasn't made
in a manufacturing plant.

21:12.405 --> 21:13.573

people like her.

21:13.706 --> 21:15.408
You gave it to someone.

21:15.542 --> 21:18.511
Someone who used it to track
and murder Elizabeth Keen.

21:18.645 --> 21:20.647
Murder? (STAMMERS)
Tell me who.

21:20.780 --> 21:23.215

I gave that to a cop.

21:24.016 --> 21:25.284
A police officer?

21:25.418 --> 21:27.887
Yeah. I met him
at a business forum.

21:28.020 --> 21:29.922
You know, where people
who are trying to start
companies

21:30.056 --> 21:31.924
set up booths
to discuss their concepts.

21:32.058 --> 21:33.426
I was trying
to find investors.

21:33.560 --> 21:36.295
You were supposed
to run a trial
in a psychiatric clinic.

21:36.429 --> 21:38.465
It got canceled.
And I was getting desperate.

21:38.598 --> 21:40.567
And then this guy
shows up,

21:40.700 --> 21:43.736
introduces himself
as a detective
from New York City.

21:43.870 --> 21:45.638
He says that he thinks
that my idea has potential,

21:45.772 --> 21:46.939
but not
for medical reasons...

21:48.375 --> 21:49.709
As a tracking device.

21:49.842 --> 21:51.143
He says the NYPD
might be interested

21:51.277 --> 21:53.145
in trying it out
for a few investigations.

21:53.279 --> 21:54.814
Did he show you
identification?

21:54.947 --> 21:56.949
Yeah. He had a badge
and everything.

21:57.083 --> 21:59.752

D-Detective Reginald Cole.

21:59.886 --> 22:01.654
I thought, hey,
it's not what I want,

22:01.788 --> 22:03.456
but if the cops
support my company,

22:03.590 --> 22:05.324
that's something.

22:05.458 --> 22:06.993
So, you gave this to him?

22:07.126 --> 22:08.828
That was a few years ago,
and then I didn't
hear from him,

22:08.961 --> 22:10.763
so I just figured
the top brass didn't bite.

22:12.799 --> 22:14.934
That's the God's
honest truth.

uh, pretty sure
I've got something,

unless I don't,
but, uh, I do.

the best way

22:38.525 --> 22:39.726
we can help
Mr. Cooper now

22:39.859 --> 22:40.827
is to find
whoever targeted him.

22:40.960 --> 22:41.894
Yeah, but it doesn't
change the crimes

22:42.028 --> 22:43.162
that he committed himself.

22:43.295 --> 22:44.330
But, yeah,
that's the idea.

22:44.464 --> 22:45.932
ARAM: Okay, so,
check this out.

22:46.065 --> 22:47.867
Mr. Cooper recorded
his last conversation

22:48.000 --> 22:49.769
with the blackmailer
and sent it to me,

22:49.902 --> 22:51.704
and I have been
listening nonstop.

22:51.838 --> 22:53.139
I thought
the voice was altered.

22:53.272 --> 22:54.874
It was, but I listened anyway,

22:55.007 --> 22:56.743
you know, for something weird
about word choice

22:56.876 --> 22:59.646
or maybe the sound
of a train or something
in the background.

22:59.779 --> 23:01.448
So you heard something?
No.

23:01.581 --> 23:03.616
Nothing. But listening
over and over again

23:03.750 --> 23:05.217
did give me
another idea.

23:05.351 --> 23:08.220
A voice modification program
is just modifying a voice.

23:08.354 --> 23:10.757
It is an algorithm
that changes key variables

23:10.890 --> 23:12.825
like pitch, tone,
speed, distortion.

23:12.959 --> 23:14.761
Okay, I actually
understood that.

23:14.894 --> 23:16.463
So I am thinking,

23:16.596 --> 23:18.164
why can't I just
invert those changes?

23:18.297 --> 23:20.366
I mean, if you knew
what changes were made,

23:20.500 --> 23:21.468
you could just reverse them

23:21.601 --> 23:23.235
and get back
to the original voice.

23:23.369 --> 23:25.538
But you can't know
the changes that were made.

23:25.672 --> 23:27.607
You mean
I can't know for sure.

23:27.740 --> 23:30.910
Fortunately,
this isn't my first rodeo.

23:31.043 --> 23:33.680
I've, um... I've never
actually been to a rodeo,

23:33.813 --> 23:36.883
so I ever go, it, uh,
will be my, uh, first rodeo,

23:37.016 --> 23:38.751
but, fortunately,
this isn't my first time

23:38.885 --> 23:41.721

and transforms.

23:41.854 --> 23:43.422
And I'm lost.

23:43.556 --> 23:44.957
Okay. The point is,

23:45.091 --> 23:46.593
I can't know what
modifications were made,

23:46.726 --> 23:49.161
but I can make a series
of educated guesses,

23:49.295 --> 23:51.664
and I know
the best software out there

23:51.798 --> 23:53.399
and how I would
sweeten the mix.

I can't know
if any of them are right,

24:09.181 --> 24:11.250
but I did reverse the process
a little differently on each.

24:11.383 --> 24:12.619
So, one of
these recordings is

24:12.752 --> 24:13.620
the blackmailer's
actual voice,

24:13.753 --> 24:14.954
but which one?

Cooper thinks
the blackmailer's

24:16.523 --> 24:18.224

from New York.

24:18.357 --> 24:20.259

from asking them.

36:49.275 --> 36:50.542
Mr. Cole is my client.

36:50.676 --> 36:52.244
As of this moment,

36:52.378 --> 36:55.213
you are precluded
from questioning him
under any circumstances.

36:57.283 --> 36:59.385
I don't know
who you are,
Mr. Lacroix,

36:59.518 --> 37:01.086
but I can tell you this,

37:01.219 --> 37:04.390
you are now squarely
on the Justice Department's
radar.

37:04.523 --> 37:05.657
You don't want to
answer our questions?

37:05.791 --> 37:07.659
We'll get the answers
anyway.

37:08.794 --> 37:10.729
Good luck with that.

37:10.862 --> 37:12.464
I'd like to see
my client now.

37:19.204 --> 37:21.840
(CLOCK TICKING)

37:21.973 --> 37:24.710
****

37:39.325 --> 37:41.527
PANABAKER: You think it'd be
that easy, Mr. Lacroix?

37:41.660 --> 37:43.395
Did you really think
you could just waltz in

37:43.529 --> 37:45.497
to a federal black site
and just start making demands?

37:45.631 --> 37:47.333
I have a right
to see my client.

37:47.466 --> 37:49.200
And you will.
At his arraignment.

37:49.335 --> 37:50.836
Oh, please.

37:50.969 --> 37:52.604
You don't have enough
to charge him.

37:52.738 --> 37:54.406
He murdered a man
named Doug Koster.

37:54.540 --> 37:56.908
That would concern me
if you had a single shred
of evidence

37:57.042 --> 37:58.243
proving that
it was actually true.

37:58.377 --> 37:59.611
He targeted
Harold Cooper,

37:59.745 --> 38:01.647
the Assistant Director of
the FBI, tried to frame him.

38:01.780 --> 38:02.781
Mere accusations.

38:02.914 --> 38:04.249
RESSLER: And the
bartender that he forced

38:04.383 --> 38:05.784
into helping him
was also killed.

38:05.917 --> 38:06.885
How sad.

38:07.018 --> 38:08.454
Not that some bartender
was killed,

38:08.587 --> 38:10.622
but that you can't seem
to accept reality.

38:10.756 --> 38:11.623
RESSLER: Yeah?
And what's that?

38:11.757 --> 38:13.859
You have nothing.

38:13.992 --> 38:15.861
You can't connect my client
to either murder.

38:15.994 --> 38:17.396
This frame-up sounds like
total fiction.

38:17.529 --> 38:18.730
That we can prove.

38:18.864 --> 38:20.432
He was blackmailing
Mr. Cooper.

38:20.566 --> 38:21.933
We have
your client's voice
on a recording.

38:22.067 --> 38:24.770
No, you have
an altered voice
on a recording.

38:24.903 --> 38:27.238
You made assumptions when
you descrambled the voice,

38:27.373 --> 38:31.009
but you can't be sure
if you accurately
reversed the process.

38:31.142 --> 38:32.944
The NYPD confirmed
that it was Cole.

38:33.078 --> 38:34.413
It sounds like Cole.

38:34.546 --> 38:36.348
Sounds like.

38:36.482 --> 38:38.450
I've heard enough.
Get him the hell out of here.

38:38.584 --> 38:39.951
Already? I'm just
getting started.

38:40.085 --> 38:42.754
Hell, I've not said a word yet
about Agent Keen.

38:44.089 --> 38:45.824
And there it is.

38:45.957 --> 38:47.292
The motive.

38:47.426 --> 38:48.894
I assume you know about
the tracking device

38:49.027 --> 38:50.662
recovered from Agent Keen?

38:50.796 --> 38:52.831
I may have heard
something, yes.

38:52.964 --> 38:55.066
Then maybe you want to
tell us why your client

38:55.200 --> 38:56.935
acquired a tracking device
that was then used

38:57.068 --> 38:58.737
to stalk and murder
one of our agents?

38:58.870 --> 39:00.372
He bought the tracker.
That's not a crime.

39:00.506 --> 39:02.474
You can't prove he caused
Keen to ingest it,

39:02.608 --> 39:05.511
and you can't prove he had
any contact with Vandyke.

39:05.644 --> 39:07.278
How do you know
that name?

39:07.413 --> 39:11.950
Enough. Agent Park,
take Mr. Lacroix
to Interrogation Two.

39:12.083 --> 39:14.520
Give him two minutes
with his client, no more,
understood?

39:14.653 --> 39:16.087
Thank you.

39:16.221 --> 39:19.357
I'll leave you folks
to talk amongst yourselves.

39:22.828 --> 39:23.795
Don't even say it.

39:23.929 --> 39:25.296
PANABAKER: I have to.
He's right.

39:25.431 --> 39:27.633
I warned you, we didn't have
enough without a confession.

39:27.766 --> 39:29.000
Don't tell me
we're cutting
this guy loose.

39:29.134 --> 39:30.135
What do you want to do,
Donald?

39:30.268 --> 39:31.670
Charge him?
And then what?

39:31.803 --> 39:34.305
Watch our case
just fall apart? No.

39:34.440 --> 39:36.675
We're gonna do this,
we do it once
and we make it stick.

39:36.808 --> 39:38.309
So that's a yes?

39:38.444 --> 39:39.845
We're just gonna let Cole
walk out of here?

39:41.813 --> 39:43.148
Raymond was right.

Mr. Cole,
your lawyer's here.

39:50.656 --> 39:51.823
Took you long enough.

39:54.025 --> 39:55.226
Have a seat.

39:55.360 --> 39:56.628
I'd rather not.

39:56.762 --> 39:58.329
I have a feeling we won't
be staying here much longer.

39:58.464 --> 40:00.499
They're releasing me?
Let's not talk here.

40:00.632 --> 40:02.000
My car is outside.

40:02.133 --> 40:03.502
I'll explain
when we get back
to my office.

40:20.452 --> 40:22.220

40:22.353 --> 40:23.689
This job
can be confusing,

40:23.822 --> 40:26.224
and I've been lost
plenty of times before,

40:26.357 --> 40:29.495
but I have no idea
who those guys are

40:29.628 --> 40:31.697
or what the heck it is
we're dealing with.

40:31.830 --> 40:34.199
Let's get a wiretap warrant
for Cole's phone.

40:34.332 --> 40:36.568
I'll ask around on the Hill,
see if anyone knows Lacroix.

40:36.702 --> 40:38.069
I'll tell Cooper
the bad news.

40:39.871 --> 40:41.072
It's not over yet.

40:43.542 --> 40:45.611

what to do.

What's his name?

40:51.883 --> 40:53.519
Reginald Cole.

40:53.652 --> 40:55.420
He's a former
New York police detective.

40:55.554 --> 40:56.588
And they're
releasing him?

40:56.722 --> 40:57.889
Not happily.

40:58.023 --> 40:59.591
But they know
the Justice Department

40:59.725 --> 41:02.193
is watching their every move,
so they won't charge

41:02.327 --> 41:04.462
if there's a possibility
the case won't hold up.

41:04.596 --> 41:06.297
Guess it's his lucky day.

41:06.431 --> 41:07.465
Hardly.

41:07.599 --> 41:08.567
If Cole
wants to live,

41:08.700 --> 41:09.835
his best chance

41:09.968 --> 41:11.970
is to stay inside
that building.

41:12.103 --> 41:14.506
He's burned, and whoever
he works for knows it.

41:14.640 --> 41:16.107
Well, he's not
the only one.
