Branch Genetics. How can I help you?

00:41.478 --> 00:44.805
Morning. Thank you.

00:44.829 --> 00:47.895
I am prepared to go as high as 35%.

00:47.919 --> 00:49.419
But I need you to guarantee that this

00:49.443 --> 00:51.880
can happen tonight, 8:00.

00:52.267 --> 00:53.838
Stay on the line.

00:55.884 --> 00:57.905
Fine. You have a deal.

00:57.929 --> 01:00.256
Your table will be ready
at 8:00 p.m. sharp.

01:00.280 --> 01:01.866
Thank God.

01:01.890 --> 01:03.501
I've been trying to get a reservation

01:03.525 --> 01:05.212
in that restaurant for months.

01:05.236 --> 01:09.475
Apparently, they have the best
tuna tartare in the city.

01:09.499 --> 01:12.920
Well, let's hope so, 'cause now
we're on the hook for a 35% tip.

01:14.532 --> 01:15.991
Emergency line.

01:17.210 --> 01:19.666
Crisis Resolution, Eric Beaumont.

01:19.690 --> 01:21.107
Hi, my name's, uh, Jenny Moran.

01:21.131 --> 01:23.747
I'm Malcolm Raskin's executive assistant,

01:23.748 --> 01:26.118
the, uh, CEO here at Branch Genetics.

01:26.142 --> 01:28.860
- Branch Genetics?
- They have us on retainer.

01:28.884 --> 01:32.298
No, I assure you, that
is not what we're about here.

01:32.322 --> 01:34.997
Uh, Mr. Raskin is on a call with someone

01:35.021 --> 01:36.607
who is claiming to have planted a bomb

01:36.631 --> 01:38.174
in one of our offices across the U.S.

01:38.198 --> 01:39.915
Okay, Jenny... uh, patch me to that call

01:39.939 --> 01:41.655
and stay on the line, please.

01:41.679 --> 01:43.048
If you would just hear me out, I could...

01:43.072 --> 01:44.920
I will not hear you out.

01:44.944 --> 01:48.623
Your company has interrupted
the order of things,

01:48.647 --> 01:50.969
the way things are supposed to be.

01:50.993 --> 01:52.928
Hello, this is Eric Beaumont
with Crisis Resolution.

01:52.952 --> 01:55.017
How can we help you get what you need?

01:55.041 --> 01:56.279
What I need

01:56.303 --> 01:59.697
is for Branch Genetics
to stop playing God.

02:06.574 --> 02:08.030
Listen to me, sir.
I know you're angry, but...

02:08.054 --> 02:11.874
I'm not angry. Anger is a prison.

02:11.898 --> 02:15.167
Okay, whoever this is, he's past
the point of no return.

02:15.191 --> 02:17.169
We need to evacuate
every Branch Genetics location

02:17.193 --> 02:19.330
across North America right now.

02:19.354 --> 02:21.154
Uh, get on with the assistant.

03:03.848 --> 03:05.565
There was an explosion in the lobby.

03:05.589 --> 03:07.393
And Mr. Raskin?

03:07.417 --> 03:11.291
You can expect another one at 5:30 p.m.

03:26.668 --> 03:34.670
Synced & corrected by -robtor-

03:53.420 --> 03:55.216
Hi. Excuse me.

03:55.251 --> 03:57.621
Hi. I'm looking for Tyler. He works here.

03:57.645 --> 03:59.492
- And you are?
- His sister.

03:59.516 --> 04:01.518
- I'll get him.
- Thanks.

04:30.504 --> 04:32.375
Tyler, your sister's upstairs.

04:38.033 --> 04:40.470
I will get rid of her.

04:51.743 --> 04:53.764
Hey, what's up?

04:53.788 --> 04:55.940
Hey. You forgot something.

04:55.964 --> 04:58.726
Thanks. You didn't
have to come all this way.

04:58.750 --> 05:00.858
Well, somebody's
got to make sure you eat.

05:00.882 --> 05:02.294
So how's the day?

05:02.318 --> 05:04.383
Just learning how to make croissants.

05:04.407 --> 05:05.525
Oh, good.

05:05.549 --> 05:07.778
I'll expect fresh ones
at the house every morning.

05:09.768 --> 05:11.234
Uh, take this.

05:13.027 --> 05:14.176
Hi, Eric.

05:14.200 --> 05:15.612
We have a case in Philadelphia.

05:15.636 --> 05:18.247
- I need you there now.
- Sure, right away.

05:20.075 --> 05:21.270
Work?

05:21.294 --> 05:22.401
Afraid so.

05:22.425 --> 05:24.012
I got to get back to it, too.

05:24.036 --> 05:25.404
Okay.

05:25.886 --> 05:27.058
Fresh.

05:28.736 --> 05:30.259
Thank you.

05:31.696 --> 05:32.847
Good luck.

05:32.871 --> 05:34.424
Thanks. See you soon.

05:40.295 --> 05:43.118
Security set up a joint
terrorism task force.

05:43.142 --> 05:46.251
They're monitoring all incoming
communication and investigating

05:46.275 --> 05:48.340
our other 30 locations
across North America.

05:48.364 --> 05:49.820
And the explosive?

05:49.844 --> 05:52.605
Bomb squad determined it was
delivered inside a package,

05:52.629 --> 05:54.401
uh, set to detonate with a timer.

05:54.425 --> 05:56.871
And did they trace the package
to a courier company?

05:56.895 --> 05:58.960
Yes, but there was no delivery scheduled

05:58.984 --> 06:00.613
- for Branch Genetics today.
- Ah.

06:00.637 --> 06:03.704
So that tells us the courier
was also likely the bomber.

06:03.728 --> 06:05.314
That's what the police are saying.

06:05.338 --> 06:07.490
Has Branch Genetics ever
received threats before?

06:07.514 --> 06:08.501
All the time.

06:08.525 --> 06:11.276
Usually by religious extremists
and the misinformed

06:11.300 --> 06:13.670
who believe we experiment with genetics.

06:13.694 --> 06:15.541
Cloning, eugenics,

06:15.565 --> 06:16.934
creating the next "super species."

06:16.958 --> 06:18.719
So in other words,
they think you're "playing God."

06:18.743 --> 06:19.676
Exactly.

06:19.700 --> 06:21.852
But-but we don't.

06:21.876 --> 06:25.508
We offer two services: Legacy,
where customers submit saliva

06:25.532 --> 06:27.771
so we can trace their family tree,

06:27.795 --> 06:31.334
and Health, where we profile
an individual's genetic makeup.

06:31.358 --> 06:33.662
We're aware the receptionist
was killed in the blast,

06:33.686 --> 06:35.997
but there was a witness
who survived the bombing.

06:36.021 --> 06:37.330
Brit Lawler.

06:37.330 --> 06:39.526
Police think she may have gotten
a glimpse of the bomber.

06:39.550 --> 06:41.528
Except doctors say the blast left her

06:41.552 --> 06:43.530
with, uh, traumatic memory impairment.

06:43.554 --> 06:44.869
She's drawing a blank.

06:45.600 --> 06:47.578
Our officers talked to her already.

06:47.602 --> 06:49.275
Uh, we understand,
Agent Jackson, but my colleague

06:49.299 --> 06:51.799
happens to be an expert in
the field of memory retrieval.

06:51.823 --> 06:54.672
So, you what? Negotiate memories
back into people's head?

06:54.696 --> 06:58.153
You know, that's really funny, but no.

06:58.177 --> 06:59.884
I'm a profiler.

07:00.484 --> 07:02.070
No offense, but I'm not a fan.

07:02.094 --> 07:04.290
Worked with dozens of
profilers over my career,

07:04.314 --> 07:05.509
haven't found them much use.

07:05.533 --> 07:06.771
Look, we all want the same thing here,

07:06.795 --> 07:08.727
to get in touch with the bomber.

07:08.751 --> 07:10.514
And when we do,
you're gonna need a negotiator.

07:11.187 --> 07:12.690
Oliver's a trained psychologist,

07:12.714 --> 07:14.387
helped save a lot of lives
doing what he does.

07:14.411 --> 07:16.432
Now, whether or not
you approve of his methods,

07:16.456 --> 07:18.154
his record is indisputable.

07:20.983 --> 07:23.241
You find anything, keep me in the loop.

07:32.255 --> 07:35.545
I can barely remember anything
after waking up this morning.

07:36.707 --> 07:39.686
The police say that you may
have seen the delivery driver.

07:39.711 --> 07:41.123
A courier?

07:41.220 --> 07:44.852
It's possible, but I-I have no idea.

07:44.876 --> 07:47.681
Listen, I know she's the only witness,

07:47.705 --> 07:49.465
but she's spoken to doctors, police...

07:49.489 --> 07:51.990
Uh, we understand that, Dan,
but with the bomber promising

07:52.014 --> 07:54.340
another attack at 5:30,
we have to move fast.

07:54.939 --> 07:56.037
It's okay, Dad.

07:56.061 --> 07:58.474
The doctor said I was lucky
I wasn't hurt worse.

07:58.498 --> 08:00.239
Why don't you go get
a coffee or something?

08:08.465 --> 08:09.913
Thanks.

08:10.467 --> 08:13.620
Brit, um, why were you
at Branch Genetics this morning?

08:13.644 --> 08:15.579
Honestly, I don't know.

08:15.603 --> 08:17.406
I've never been there before.

08:17.430 --> 08:19.104
Can you recall anything?
Your state of mind

08:19.128 --> 08:20.322
when you left the house?

08:20.346 --> 08:22.411
What you had for breakfast?

08:22.967 --> 08:24.370
Okay, j... uh, just
try to focus for a second...

08:24.394 --> 08:27.591
- I am trying.
- Okay, Eric, can I have the room?

08:27.615 --> 08:30.158
Of course.

08:30.683 --> 08:33.597
Okay. Brit, we're gonna attempt

08:33.621 --> 08:37.296
a little therapeutic exercise to
try and stimulate your memory.

08:37.320 --> 08:41.822
Now, I don't want you to actively try

08:41.846 --> 08:45.239
to remember anything,
I just want you to listen. Okay?

08:45.807 --> 08:49.525
Okay, good. Now close your eyes.

08:51.746 --> 08:54.530
You're in your bed. It's morning.

08:54.554 --> 08:57.794
Feel the mattress beneath you
and the blanket on top of you.

08:59.420 --> 09:01.886
Now your alarm goes off and you wake up.

09:01.910 --> 09:03.714
Maybe you get something to eat,

09:04.571 --> 09:06.542
get dressed, leave the house.

09:06.566 --> 09:08.588
It's a normal day, so you're not rushing.

09:08.612 --> 09:10.503
And you step outside.

09:10.527 --> 09:12.723
The traffic is loud,

09:12.747 --> 09:14.725
but it quiets down as you arrive

09:14.749 --> 09:16.117
at Branch Genetics.

09:16.141 --> 09:17.597
You walk towards the lobby.

09:17.621 --> 09:19.884
You open the door, step inside...

09:27.500 --> 09:29.087
No.

09:29.111 --> 09:30.610
A flash of light.

09:30.634 --> 09:33.047
Please stop.

09:33.071 --> 09:35.331
A loud noise, like thunder.

09:43.429 --> 09:45.388
I was picking something up.

09:47.564 --> 09:48.846
Anything?

09:48.870 --> 09:51.097
She's being prepped for release.

09:51.611 --> 09:53.764
She can't recall what, but Brit believes

09:53.788 --> 09:56.549
she went to Branch Genetics
to pick something up.

09:57.186 --> 09:58.769
Check to see if you can find
a connection between Brit...

09:58.793 --> 10:01.772
Between Brit
and Branch Genetics. I'm on it.

10:01.796 --> 10:03.730
You know, something else
the bomber said struck me.

10:03.754 --> 10:07.081
"Anger is a prison." I don't
know, it sounded stilted, rote,

10:07.105 --> 10:10.563
like he was reciting
or preaching or something.

10:10.587 --> 10:13.055
Brit is still our best bet
of identifying the bomber.

10:13.079 --> 10:15.568
Okay, well, why don't I see
if she'll let me take her home?

10:15.592 --> 10:17.439
Recreating her daily routine may allow

10:17.463 --> 10:19.790
for pieces of her memory
to fall into place.

10:19.814 --> 10:22.618
That stilted statement our bomber gave?

10:22.642 --> 10:24.098
It's actually part of a mantra belonging

10:24.122 --> 10:26.492
to an anger management
self-help group here in Philly.

10:26.516 --> 10:28.102
Eastside Anger Management.

10:28.126 --> 10:30.520
Sounds like a good place to start.

10:36.526 --> 10:39.157
He said, "Anger is a prison."

10:39.181 --> 10:41.942
"A prison I no longer need
to incarcerate myself in,

10:41.966 --> 10:43.814
"for I have given myself permission

10:43.838 --> 10:45.990
to know what lies beneath it."

10:46.014 --> 10:47.487
That's the whole thing.

10:48.696 --> 10:50.646
Do any of your members

10:50.670 --> 10:53.586
have experience with
or access to explosives?

10:57.721 --> 10:59.481
Can you give us a name?

11:01.681 --> 11:04.138
Eastside Anger Management is made up

11:04.162 --> 11:07.141
of men who have been
court-ordered to attend.

11:07.165 --> 11:09.100
Most of these guys' problems stem from

11:09.124 --> 11:10.971
lack of self-confidence and trust issues.

11:10.995 --> 11:13.669
Everything that happens here
is confidential.

11:13.693 --> 11:15.106
The bomber said there's gonna be

11:15.130 --> 11:16.498
another explosion today.

11:16.891 --> 11:18.500
How are you going to feel if it turns out

11:18.524 --> 11:20.004
you could've prevented it?

11:21.832 --> 11:23.767
Name's Jed Lincoln.

11:23.791 --> 11:26.595
Got fired from his last job
for threatening his boss.

11:26.619 --> 11:28.291
Judge sent him here.

11:28.315 --> 11:29.729
What was his job?

11:29.753 --> 11:31.233
Demolition.

11:32.681 --> 11:35.031
So he's trained in explosives.

11:38.501 --> 11:40.827
Brit does a good job
of keeping the place tidy.

11:42.244 --> 11:43.787
Lord knows I'm not much help.

11:43.811 --> 11:45.658
How long have you lived with your dad?

11:45.682 --> 11:48.269
Um, since my mom died
about a year ago.Mm.

11:48.293 --> 11:50.271
The last thing she said to me
before she passed

11:50.295 --> 11:52.230
was to take care of him

11:52.254 --> 11:54.778
- if she wasn't around.
- And she has.

11:56.606 --> 11:57.888
So, what do we do?

11:57.912 --> 12:00.325
Something called immersion therapy.

12:00.349 --> 12:02.936
We're gonna walk you through
your normal daily routine

12:02.960 --> 12:04.808
and hopefully it'll trigger
your memory and allow you

12:04.832 --> 12:06.940
to form a picture of the courier
you might've seen.

12:06.964 --> 12:09.334
And if you want to stop or need anything,

12:09.358 --> 12:11.815
- I'll be right here for you, sweetheart.
- Thank you.

12:11.839 --> 12:15.002
Okay, so let's start with
when you wake up in the morning.

12:15.026 --> 12:17.255
I wake up at the same time every day.

12:17.279 --> 12:18.952
7:45.

12:19.412 --> 12:20.954
I...

12:20.978 --> 12:22.248
get up...

12:23.155 --> 12:24.263
and...

12:24.634 --> 12:26.157
I do yoga.

12:31.976 --> 12:34.781
Which always makes me feel good.

12:34.992 --> 12:36.230
Um...

12:36.254 --> 12:38.169
I take a shower.

12:44.770 --> 12:47.067
And then...

12:47.091 --> 12:49.093
I get dressed.

12:51.661 --> 12:54.205
And then, then I eat my morning toast.

12:54.229 --> 12:57.208
- Over the sink.
- It's a time-saver.

12:57.232 --> 12:59.210
Well, it looks like you were on track

12:59.234 --> 13:00.733
up until this point.

13:00.757 --> 13:02.909
Then I head to the front door where I get

13:02.933 --> 13:05.240
my transit pass so I can take the bus.

13:11.066 --> 13:12.720
This transit pass?

13:13.422 --> 13:16.183
Brit, if you didn't take
the bus this morning,

13:16.546 --> 13:18.307
how did you get to Branch Genetics?

13:19.222 --> 13:21.639
Sometimes I take a rideshare, but...

13:24.769 --> 13:26.585
I did.

13:26.609 --> 13:29.109
- I took a rideshare this morning.
- Okay, great.

13:29.133 --> 13:30.589
What else?

13:30.613 --> 13:32.983
I usually have about ten minutes
before the bus comes,

13:33.007 --> 13:36.247
so I just hang out here
and check my e-mails.

13:36.271 --> 13:37.990
And did you check 'em this morning?

13:48.457 --> 13:50.130
Brit, what is it? No.

13:50.154 --> 13:51.958
- Do-do you remember something?
- Take a breath, honey.

13:52.709 --> 13:53.971
No.

13:55.855 --> 13:57.964
You need to leave now.

13:57.988 --> 13:59.574
- Brit?
- Brit.

13:59.598 --> 14:01.489
- What do you remember, Brit?
- I'm sorry, Mr. Yates.

14:01.513 --> 14:03.013
My daughter's already been

14:03.037 --> 14:04.449
through enough today.

14:04.473 --> 14:05.996
Brit? Honey.

14:46.011 --> 14:47.162
She kicked you out?

14:47.186 --> 14:48.772
Right after she remembered something.

14:48.796 --> 14:50.730
Her reaction was different, though.

14:50.754 --> 14:52.994
It was more sadness than fear.

14:53.018 --> 14:54.125
I think she recalled something

14:54.149 --> 14:55.692
that happened before the bombing.

14:55.716 --> 14:57.695
Why wouldn't she tell you what it was?

14:58.414 --> 15:00.044
Well, Agent Jackson wanted
to be kept in the loop,

15:00.068 --> 15:01.785
- so you better let her know.
- I already did.

15:01.809 --> 15:04.396
I ran the name Jed Lincoln
and spoke to his boss.

15:04.420 --> 15:05.832
He called in sick this morning.

15:05.856 --> 15:07.660
I just tried to reach him, but no luck.

15:07.684 --> 15:09.227
So that could have been him

15:09.251 --> 15:10.837
in the pickup truck outside Brit's house.

15:10.861 --> 15:13.666
Demolition expert
with anger issues and no alibi.

15:13.690 --> 15:15.438
That guy has a lot stacked against him.

15:15.462 --> 15:17.192
Well, if he's our bomber
and was court-ordered

15:17.216 --> 15:19.759
to anger management,
he won't risk missing a meeting.

15:19.783 --> 15:21.761
Brit Lawler says she was in your lobby

15:21.785 --> 15:23.154
this morning to pick something up.

15:23.178 --> 15:24.373
Was she a customer?

15:24.805 --> 15:26.462
Possibly.

15:26.486 --> 15:29.073
Client base sits at about
15 million worldwide.

15:29.097 --> 15:31.554
You have the means to find out, though.

15:32.104 --> 15:34.165
Our privacy policy is strict.

15:34.189 --> 15:36.776
As CEO, I'm the last person
who can afford to breach it.

15:36.800 --> 15:39.518
Given what another bombing would
do to your company, Mr. Raskin,

15:40.029 --> 15:42.521
you're the last person
who could afford not to.

15:42.545 --> 15:44.983
One of your employees died today.

15:54.731 --> 15:56.187
Eight months ago, Brit Lawler,

15:56.211 --> 15:58.885
her mother Linda, and father Dan...

15:58.909 --> 16:01.453
all purchased
the Legacy + Health package.

16:01.477 --> 16:03.152
You have the results?

16:07.527 --> 16:09.853
Jenny, I just, uh, sent the Lawler file

16:09.877 --> 16:11.731
- to the printer... can you bring it in?
- The bomber said

16:11.755 --> 16:14.292
the next attack would happen
at 5:30 p.m. today.

16:14.316 --> 16:16.164
- Do you have any idea why?
- No.

16:16.188 --> 16:17.948
The police reviewed
our corporate calendar,

16:17.972 --> 16:19.123
pretty standard meetings.

16:19.147 --> 16:21.323
Our shareholders' annual is next month.

16:21.347 --> 16:22.690
If the bomber wanted to make a statement,

16:22.714 --> 16:24.085
that would be the place.

16:24.448 --> 16:26.111
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

16:32.030 --> 16:34.032
- Oh, my God.
- What is it?

16:35.294 --> 16:36.877
I have to go.

16:43.476 --> 16:47.064
Brit and her family were all
customers of Branch Genetics.

16:47.088 --> 16:49.164
Brit's mother had the HTT gene.

16:49.188 --> 16:51.112
It's responsible for
the inevitable development

16:51.136 --> 16:53.027
of Huntington's Disease;
there isn't a cure.

16:53.051 --> 16:54.550
But there's more. Keep reading.

16:55.713 --> 16:57.292
Brit has it, too.

16:57.316 --> 16:58.684
That could be what she remembered

16:58.708 --> 16:59.859
when she kicked me out...

16:59.883 --> 17:01.777
her diagnosis.

17:02.277 --> 17:04.342
Okay, um, there may be a way

17:04.366 --> 17:06.344
that I can still get her to cooperate.

17:06.367 --> 17:09.067
All right, get on it.
We'll check out Jed.

17:17.098 --> 17:18.641
Got your message about
a possible sighting

17:18.665 --> 17:20.208
of the bomber outside Brit's house.

17:20.232 --> 17:21.339
Yeah, we thought it might be him

17:21.363 --> 17:22.819
trying to silence the only witness.

17:22.843 --> 17:24.864
I gave a description of
the vehicle to your team.

17:24.887 --> 17:27.519
Good. Forensics say
the bomb was likely homemade,

17:27.542 --> 17:28.912
a crude device.

17:28.936 --> 17:30.131
Parts are generic,
but we're trying to trace them.

17:30.155 --> 17:31.306
Can I see that?

17:31.330 --> 17:33.090
We're gonna take another run at Brit.

17:33.114 --> 17:34.966
She's fragile, but I think
pieces of her memory

17:34.990 --> 17:37.181
- are starting to come back.
- Great. I'll come with.

17:37.205 --> 17:39.053
Well, I don't know if
that's the best idea.

17:39.077 --> 17:41.166
I didn't know you were calling
the shots, Mr. Profiler.

17:42.689 --> 17:44.691
Consider me put in my place.

17:53.091 --> 17:55.069
Hey, Jed, um...

17:55.093 --> 17:56.415
can I have a minute?

17:57.660 --> 17:59.203
Yeah, what's up, Harry?

17:59.227 --> 18:02.293
Some people are here
who want to talk to you.

18:02.317 --> 18:05.103
Just, um, stay calm.

18:08.323 --> 18:10.301
Jed Lincoln? Eric Beaumont.

18:10.325 --> 18:11.955
This is my colleague Cynthia Walker.

18:11.979 --> 18:13.957
I take it you heard about the bombing

18:13.981 --> 18:15.915
at Branch Genetics this morning.

18:15.939 --> 18:17.265
I had nothing to do with that.

18:17.289 --> 18:19.813
Oh, we didn't insinuate that you did.

18:21.684 --> 18:22.792
Harry, what's this about?

18:22.816 --> 18:25.012
Jed, take a breath. Remember,

18:25.036 --> 18:27.144
anger is a secondary emotion.

18:27.168 --> 18:28.276
It's what we use to protect ourselves

18:28.300 --> 18:29.886
from our primary feelings.

18:29.910 --> 18:32.280
We're working with a witness
who was caught in the blast.

18:32.304 --> 18:34.412
Someone who may be able
to identify the bomber.

18:34.436 --> 18:36.110
Brit Lawler is her name.

18:36.134 --> 18:38.895
Brit? Is she all right?

18:38.919 --> 18:39.939
You know her?

18:40.876 --> 18:42.545
We dated for a while.

18:43.601 --> 18:44.795
That's all.

18:44.838 --> 18:46.033
The bomber used a phrase connected with

18:46.057 --> 18:47.425
Eastside Anger Management.

18:47.449 --> 18:49.906
Brit was at Branch Genetics
when the bomb went off.

18:49.930 --> 18:51.777
The fact that you two dated
is a pretty big coincidence.

18:51.801 --> 18:53.736
And you split up.

18:53.760 --> 18:55.558
Brit had a tough year
with her mother passing.

18:56.433 --> 18:58.185
I did my best to help her.

18:58.852 --> 19:01.396
At the end, she said
she didn't want to be

19:01.420 --> 19:02.701
close to anyone anymore.

19:02.725 --> 19:04.268
How'd that make you feel?

19:04.292 --> 19:08.383
You mean, did it make me angry? No.

19:10.781 --> 19:13.277
I gave her what she asked for... space.

19:13.301 --> 19:15.477
But you still have feelings for her.

19:17.496 --> 19:18.560
I don't got to talk to you.

19:18.585 --> 19:20.587
- I'm done with this.
- Jed.

19:36.846 --> 19:38.172
Truck matches Oliver's description.

19:38.196 --> 19:40.130
He was outside Brit's house this morning.

19:40.154 --> 19:42.855
I'll let Oliver and Zara know
Brit and Jed were dating.

19:45.159 --> 19:48.051
Hey, Dan, is Brit still here?

19:48.075 --> 19:51.402
Uh, she's not doing so well.
She-she won't want to talk.

19:51.426 --> 19:54.299
Then I'll need Brit
to tell me that herself, sir.

19:59.042 --> 19:59.976
Thank you.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.002
Brit.

20:04.047 --> 20:06.137
Hey, how you doing?

20:07.359 --> 20:08.839
I'll be fine.

20:09.227 --> 20:13.250
And I'm sorry about before,
but I prefer to be alone.

20:13.274 --> 20:14.643
Thank you for understanding.

20:14.667 --> 20:16.601
Listen, Brit, we know you're scared,

20:16.625 --> 20:18.473
and it's not just because of the bomb.

20:18.497 --> 20:22.783
We know you inherited
the HTT gene from your mother.

20:23.103 --> 20:24.851
And we're sorry.

20:31.292 --> 20:33.072
I know I should have reminded you,

20:34.990 --> 20:36.447
but when you woke up in the hospital,

20:36.471 --> 20:39.842
you were scared and relieved.

20:39.866 --> 20:41.713
Hopeful, even.

20:42.256 --> 20:44.625
It's been a long time since
I've seen you like that.

20:46.133 --> 20:49.504
My mom jumped at the chance
to find out what made her her.

20:49.528 --> 20:51.723
To find out where she came from.

20:51.747 --> 20:54.117
But when she took the test,

20:54.141 --> 20:57.468
she found out she was destined
to die from Huntington's.

20:58.347 --> 21:01.080
Do you know what the disease does to you?

21:01.104 --> 21:03.082
Before the physical symptoms show up,

21:03.106 --> 21:04.345
you get depressed.

21:04.369 --> 21:06.438
You just lose hope.

21:07.415 --> 21:10.829
Worst of all, you lose
the ability to feel emotion.

21:11.402 --> 21:13.049
You become a husk.

21:14.530 --> 21:16.313
But Huntington's didn't take my mom.

21:16.337 --> 21:18.185
Brit, you don't have to talk about this.

21:18.209 --> 21:19.142
Three months after she was

21:19.166 --> 21:20.317
- diagnosed...
- Honey.

21:20.341 --> 21:21.560
...she hung herself.

21:23.605 --> 21:25.607
Enough, please.

21:27.218 --> 21:28.195
I can't...

21:28.460 --> 21:29.979
Uh...

21:30.003 --> 21:31.198
Hey, Dan,

21:31.222 --> 21:33.765
um, why don't we take a walk?

21:34.174 --> 21:36.183
I could use some fresh air myself.

21:44.104 --> 21:47.866
Look, Brit, I know all you feel
right now is despair,

21:47.890 --> 21:50.695
but when you talked to me
about your morning routine,

21:50.719 --> 21:53.220
you described how happy
yoga made you feel.

21:53.244 --> 21:56.614
Now, if you let me help you
retrieve your memories,

21:56.638 --> 21:59.051
we might be able
to get you back to a place

21:59.075 --> 22:00.686
where you can feel that again.

22:02.731 --> 22:03.926
Okay.

22:03.950 --> 22:05.928
So this morning we tried
immersion therapy

22:05.952 --> 22:07.583
with some success.

22:07.954 --> 22:10.324
Sometimes doing the opposite can also

22:10.348 --> 22:12.064
trigger memories.

22:12.088 --> 22:13.544
How do I do that?

22:13.568 --> 22:16.547
With a therapeutic technique
called "Fly on the Wall."

22:16.571 --> 22:20.856
Close your eyes and you remove
yourself from your experience,

22:20.880 --> 22:23.119
like, you're outside
of your body looking down

22:23.143 --> 22:26.310
on yourself, kind of like
a fly on the wall would see you.

22:26.973 --> 22:30.063
Trust him. He's been right so far.

22:30.716 --> 22:33.284
Don't let it go to your head.

22:35.938 --> 22:38.177
It's just not right, you know?

22:38.201 --> 22:40.310
I mean, nobody deserves
a disease like this,

22:40.334 --> 22:42.138
but for it to happen to Brit is...

22:42.162 --> 22:44.578
- It's not fair.
- Exactly.

22:45.078 --> 22:48.536
Huntington's takes time
before it's debilitating.

22:48.560 --> 22:51.335
You still have a lot of years
with your daughter.

22:52.461 --> 22:55.218
Years that were almost stolen
from us this morning.

22:59.266 --> 23:00.809
You usually take a bus to work,

23:01.470 --> 23:03.159
but today

23:03.183 --> 23:04.723
you took a rideshare.

23:05.165 --> 23:07.578
As a fly on the wall, can you see why?

23:26.535 --> 23:27.687
I got a call.

23:28.080 --> 23:29.403
From who?

23:29.427 --> 23:31.230
I don't know.

23:31.254 --> 23:34.257
Just, uh, hold on.

23:38.572 --> 23:40.345
_

23:41.395 --> 23:44.137
What can you tell us about your
relationship to Jed Lincoln?

23:45.747 --> 23:47.334
What does he have to do with anything?

23:47.358 --> 23:48.596
Maybe nothing. We're just curious.

23:48.620 --> 23:50.186
How did you two meet?

24:21.392 --> 24:23.413
No!

24:23.437 --> 24:25.197
Okay, Brit, it's okay. I'm right here.

24:25.221 --> 24:27.939
I can't do this! I can't do this!

24:27.963 --> 24:30.899
I think she's reliving
the trauma of the bombings

24:30.923 --> 24:32.335
with both of us in the room.

24:32.359 --> 24:33.945
Understood. I'll get out of your hair,

24:33.969 --> 24:36.356
but let me know if she says
anything else. Good luck.

24:40.806 --> 24:44.288
Brit, it's okay.
Just, uh, take a deep breath.

24:47.243 --> 24:48.994
You didn't want to talk because, because

24:49.281 --> 24:51.283
of the police officer.

24:53.511 --> 24:54.947
It was me.

24:56.480 --> 24:58.045
What was you?

24:59.691 --> 25:01.301
I built the bombs.

25:39.729 --> 25:41.969
Police! Police! Put your hands up!

26:26.081 --> 26:27.276
You got it, right?

26:27.759 --> 26:29.670
The laptop... you grabbed it, right?

26:29.694 --> 26:32.000
Yeah, of course.

26:38.398 --> 26:39.528
This is where I did it.

26:39.552 --> 26:41.641
All of this was on the list
Agent Jackson gave us.

26:41.665 --> 26:43.136
You remember building the bombs?

26:43.160 --> 26:46.513
Well, not specifically, but I
definitely remember holding it,

26:46.537 --> 26:48.689
and I knew where this place was, so...

26:48.713 --> 26:51.692
Why, Brit? Why... why would you do this?

26:51.716 --> 26:53.607
I don't know.

26:53.631 --> 26:54.926
If you knew the bomb was going off,

26:54.951 --> 26:55.962
why would you go there?

26:55.986 --> 26:58.786
I guess I had a change of heart,
I didn't want anyone to die?

26:58.810 --> 27:00.527
Well, if you don't want
anyone else to die,

27:00.551 --> 27:02.616
tell us where the next attack
is gonna happen.

27:02.640 --> 27:05.619
I don't remember. I'm so sorry.

27:05.643 --> 27:08.056
Brit, I got to say I'm having
a hard time buying this.

27:08.080 --> 27:11.842
I can't believe it either,
but I had the bomb in my hands.

27:11.866 --> 27:12.843
I know it.

27:12.867 --> 27:14.323
Well, you definitely had help.

27:14.347 --> 27:15.538
We were talking to the bomber

27:15.562 --> 27:18.066
when the explosion happened,
and they continued talking

27:18.090 --> 27:20.242
after the blast. Meanwhile,
you were found unconscious.

27:20.266 --> 27:21.548
So if you don't remember where

27:21.572 --> 27:23.288
the next attack is, your partner will.

27:23.312 --> 27:26.248
With all signs of that pointing
at your ex-boyfriend Jed.

27:26.272 --> 27:27.512
Why would he do this?

27:27.536 --> 27:29.686
You know, it's clear that Jed
still has feelings for you.

27:29.710 --> 27:31.558
If you can help lure him out,
we can work on him

27:31.582 --> 27:33.255
to give us the location
of the next attack.

27:33.279 --> 27:35.281
Okay, come on.

27:39.527 --> 27:41.331
Search the house.
See if you can find anything

27:41.356 --> 27:42.953
that might give us an
insight into Brit's motive.

27:42.978 --> 27:44.078
Okay.

27:44.103 --> 27:45.841
It could tell us where
the next attack's gonna happen.

27:45.866 --> 27:47.047
Okay.

27:51.112 --> 27:52.552
Look at this.

27:59.087 --> 28:00.644
Someone broke in here.

28:08.828 --> 28:10.458
You know, I feel for Brit,

28:10.482 --> 28:13.406
but there is no excuse
for taking another human life.

28:15.700 --> 28:16.855
Um...

28:16.879 --> 28:18.727
Cynthia, I'm sorry,
I did not mean it like...

28:18.751 --> 28:20.120
It's okay.

28:20.144 --> 28:22.861
My brother didn't mean
to kill our foster father,

28:22.885 --> 28:25.335
though they made him
pay for it like he did.

28:28.848 --> 28:31.740
Wait a second. What is it?

28:31.764 --> 28:34.134
Brit's mom was tested by Branch Genetics

28:34.158 --> 28:36.136
- eight months ago, right?
- Mm-hmm.

28:36.160 --> 28:37.833
Two weeks after she was tested,

28:37.857 --> 28:39.965
her health insurance was canceled.

28:39.989 --> 28:41.445
Because of her Huntington's diagnosis?

28:41.469 --> 28:42.925
No, it couldn't have been.

28:42.949 --> 28:46.668
Brit's mom received the results
from Branch Genetics...

28:46.898 --> 28:48.974
after her health insurance was canceled.

28:49.609 --> 28:51.847
Which means the insurance
company wouldn't have even known

28:51.871 --> 28:53.588
about her genetic disorder yet,

28:53.612 --> 28:55.285
so why cancel her coverage?

28:55.309 --> 28:57.033
Unless someone else told them.

29:01.496 --> 29:03.250
Brit, we know you don't remember if Jed

29:03.274 --> 29:05.556
is involved, but you need
to play it like you know he was.

29:05.580 --> 29:08.951
We just need Jed to tell us the
location of the next bombing.

29:08.975 --> 29:12.239
Don't worry, everything's gonna be okay.

29:16.643 --> 29:17.971
He's here.

29:27.646 --> 29:29.972
Brit, are you okay?

29:29.996 --> 29:32.100
I'm fine, Jed. Listen...

29:32.124 --> 29:33.431
You shouldn't have gone there
this morning.

29:33.455 --> 29:34.542
You could've been killed.

29:34.566 --> 29:37.371
I was trying to stop us
from making a huge mistake.

29:37.395 --> 29:38.981
Us?

29:39.005 --> 29:40.852
I don't want to take any more lives.

29:40.876 --> 29:43.377
What are you talking about?
You're not involved.

29:43.401 --> 29:45.596
No, Jed, please just tell me
where we were setting

29:45.620 --> 29:47.274
the next bomb off so I can stop it.

29:52.148 --> 29:53.541
You're setting me up.

29:56.588 --> 29:59.504
No, Jed, please, stop.

30:02.599 --> 30:03.832
Get out of my way,

30:03.856 --> 30:05.703
- or I'm gonna...
- Or what? What are you gonna do?

30:05.727 --> 30:07.009
You're gonna threaten to kill us?

30:07.520 --> 30:09.356
Like you threatened your old boss?

30:09.992 --> 30:11.720
You know, you work in demolition,

30:11.744 --> 30:13.033
you know explosives.

30:13.057 --> 30:14.756
You're court-ordered
to attend anger management,

30:14.780 --> 30:16.453
the bomber used Eastside

30:16.477 --> 30:18.629
Anger Management's mantra in the attack.

30:18.653 --> 30:20.079
Not to mention you were staking out

30:20.103 --> 30:21.617
Brit's house this morning. Why, Jed?

30:23.096 --> 30:24.311
Brit, tell them this wasn't me.

30:25.455 --> 30:26.618
I'm sorry.

30:27.791 --> 30:29.772
I can't remember.

30:29.796 --> 30:31.198
I didn't do this.

30:31.222 --> 30:32.929
But you know who did.

30:32.953 --> 30:34.602
No, I don't know anything.

30:34.626 --> 30:38.416
I just found out that your mom's
health insurance was canceled

30:38.440 --> 30:42.819
a month before Branch Genetics
diagnosed her with HTT.

30:42.843 --> 30:44.213
Well, don't you find it strange

30:44.237 --> 30:46.370
that she had coverage her whole
life, and then right before

30:46.394 --> 30:49.815
receiving her terminal
diagnosis, she loses it?

30:49.839 --> 30:51.001
What are you saying?

30:51.025 --> 30:52.891
Well, that if you believed
Branch Genetics sold

30:52.915 --> 30:55.004
your mother's genetic report
to her health insurance company,

30:55.028 --> 30:58.674
you would have a very clear
motive to bomb them.

31:03.163 --> 31:05.242
- She didn't do it!
- Now, she's confessed.

31:05.267 --> 31:07.549
All we needed was motive
and now we have it.

31:07.870 --> 31:09.413
So if you really care about her,

31:09.438 --> 31:11.547
you better tell us
what you know now right now,

31:11.572 --> 31:13.922
or she's going to prison
for the rest of her life.

31:16.039 --> 31:17.215
It was Dan.

31:18.389 --> 31:20.193
My father?

31:20.719 --> 31:22.108
Yeah.

31:23.305 --> 31:25.329
Oh, my God.

31:26.641 --> 31:28.225
I remember.

31:31.402 --> 31:34.077
My dad bought the
genetics test for my mom

31:34.101 --> 31:35.317
as a birthday present.

31:36.233 --> 31:37.907
Happy birthday, sweetheart.

31:37.931 --> 31:40.692
I know it's what you wanted.

31:42.239 --> 31:43.956
But after she was diagnosed

31:43.980 --> 31:45.131
and took her own life...

31:45.155 --> 31:48.028
he went into a grief spiral.

31:52.249 --> 31:55.663
He blamed Branch Genetics
for my mom's death.

31:55.687 --> 31:59.232
I told him that was ridiculous,
it wasn't their fault, but...

31:59.256 --> 32:00.633
he wouldn't listen.

32:01.542 --> 32:03.671
He was ordered to attend
anger management,

32:03.696 --> 32:05.329
where he met Jed.

32:11.030 --> 32:12.205
Where I met Jed.

32:18.161 --> 32:19.530
Her dad needed a job.

32:19.555 --> 32:21.337
So I figured it would
impress her if I got him one.

32:21.424 --> 32:22.923
I got him doing grunt work at my company.

32:24.240 --> 32:26.956
He was really curious about explosives.

32:26.980 --> 32:29.092
Always asking questions and stuff.

32:29.117 --> 32:30.442
I remember I was just

32:30.467 --> 32:31.444
about to leave the house this morning

32:31.469 --> 32:32.882
to go to work when Jed called.

32:32.907 --> 32:34.841
He said someone had stolen
explosive materials

32:34.866 --> 32:35.930
from his work.

32:36.119 --> 32:38.382
He had a feeling it was my dad.

32:47.522 --> 32:49.239
And then what I found
in the garage confirmed

32:49.263 --> 32:51.221
Jed's suspicions.

32:53.441 --> 32:56.681
I wasn't at Branch Genetics
to pick something up.

32:56.705 --> 32:58.707
I was there trying to stop the bombing.

33:02.885 --> 33:04.697
Look, I thought if I said something,

33:04.721 --> 33:06.299
I'd be implicated as an accessory.

33:06.323 --> 33:08.171
I went to the house to confront Dan,

33:08.195 --> 33:09.777
but you guys were there so I couldn't.

33:09.778 --> 33:10.973
If your father knows Branch Genetics sold

33:10.997 --> 33:12.278
customer info to the insurance company

33:12.302 --> 33:14.367
that dropped your mother's coverage...

33:14.391 --> 33:15.891
Then the health insurance
company seems like

33:15.915 --> 33:17.196
the next logical target.

33:17.220 --> 33:19.024
Get ahold of Special Agent Jackson.

33:19.048 --> 33:20.672
We need to find your father.

33:34.847 --> 33:36.433
I told you you could look forward

33:36.457 --> 33:37.806
to another explosion today.

33:40.358 --> 33:41.288
Right?

33:46.114 --> 33:47.816
Drive.

34:00.566 --> 34:03.064
Hey, Zara, what's up?

34:03.874 --> 34:06.330
We contacted the
health insurance company.

34:06.354 --> 34:09.072
All of their top execs are
at a business retreat today.

34:09.096 --> 34:11.858
Sounds like the perfect
opportunity to take revenge.

34:11.882 --> 34:13.337
Guess what time the presentation

34:13.360 --> 34:15.121
on preexisting conditions starts.

34:15.146 --> 34:16.509
5:30.

34:16.509 --> 34:18.400
Exactly when the bomber said
the next attack would happen.

34:18.424 --> 34:20.358
Zara, where's this retreat being held?

34:20.382 --> 34:21.558
I'll text you the address.

34:37.399 --> 34:40.880
Get out of the car
and bring the bag with you.

34:47.181 --> 34:50.118
Which brings us
to the thorny issue of coverage

34:50.143 --> 34:53.862
for preexisting conditions
and chronic diseases, which...

34:53.887 --> 34:55.480
excuse me, what's going...

34:57.896 --> 34:59.094
As you can see,

34:59.118 --> 35:01.357
- Mr. Raskin here...
- Oh, please, please, please...

35:01.381 --> 35:04.360
is holding a bomb which will
go off when I push this button.

35:04.384 --> 35:06.101
- If anyone moves...
- Mr. Lawler, please...

35:06.125 --> 35:07.102
Shut up.

35:07.126 --> 35:08.669
Okay. Okay. Be calm. Okay.

35:10.131 --> 35:12.629
You've all been playing God

35:13.312 --> 35:14.444
for too long.

35:23.336 --> 35:24.859
The woman you're looking at is...

35:26.798 --> 35:27.818
was...

35:28.841 --> 35:30.125
the love of my life.

35:30.510 --> 35:33.800
She died last year. Coroners ruled it

35:33.824 --> 35:35.478
a suicide. It wasn't.

35:35.502 --> 35:39.212
It was murder,
and every single one of you

35:39.236 --> 35:40.352
murdered her.

35:40.937 --> 35:43.578
She hung herself
because she didn't want me

35:43.602 --> 35:45.836
selling off our house
to pay for treatment.

35:45.860 --> 35:48.612
The house we were supposed

35:48.636 --> 35:50.711
to grow old in together.

35:51.072 --> 35:52.364
And I wouldn't have had to

35:52.388 --> 35:56.673
if you heartless monsters didn't
cancel her health insurance.

35:57.312 --> 36:00.073
That data gets used for research

36:00.098 --> 36:02.990
- to find cures for diseases...
- Stop.

36:03.014 --> 36:04.905
You sold it to insurance companies

36:04.929 --> 36:06.087
to make profit.

36:06.714 --> 36:10.717
You knew exactly how they were
gonna use the information.

36:19.901 --> 36:21.922
Once all of you are dead

36:22.270 --> 36:24.882
and the press asks why this happened,

36:24.906 --> 36:27.754
then the world will find out
what you did, and this will

36:27.778 --> 36:29.408
never happen again.

36:29.432 --> 36:30.453
Dad.

36:31.703 --> 36:32.747
Brit.

36:32.822 --> 36:34.457
Get out of here.

36:34.481 --> 36:37.155
Dad, please put the gun down.

36:37.179 --> 36:39.026
I-I can't lose you, too.

36:39.050 --> 36:41.159
Not now. Not after
everything else we've lost.

36:41.183 --> 36:42.639
They murdered your mother.

36:42.663 --> 36:44.317
This is necessary.

36:45.840 --> 36:47.320
Okay.

37:02.160 --> 37:04.045
Dan, I-I know you want revenge.

37:04.069 --> 37:06.053
But if you want the world
to know Branch Genetics

37:06.077 --> 37:07.664
sells customer info
to insurance companies,

37:07.688 --> 37:08.911
you-you don't have to kill them.

37:08.935 --> 37:10.275
Malcolm can make a statement.

37:10.299 --> 37:11.711
The value of the company will plummet.

37:11.735 --> 37:14.303
That won't stop them. I have to do this!

37:17.350 --> 37:18.501
- Freeze!
- Hey! Hey!

37:18.525 --> 37:20.416
- Get down!
- If they come any closer,

37:20.440 --> 37:22.331
- I'm gonna blow us all up!
- We can take it from here,

37:22.355 --> 37:24.071
- Mr. Beaumont.
- Okay, Shay, please.

37:24.095 --> 37:25.334
You asked Brit to trust me.

37:25.358 --> 37:26.663
I'm gonna need you to do the same.

37:31.277 --> 37:32.924
Dan, listen to me.

37:33.366 --> 37:34.778
You think this is the only way,

37:34.802 --> 37:36.432
but that's because you feel powerless.

37:37.452 --> 37:40.349
You felt that way after
your wife was diagnosed,

37:40.373 --> 37:42.089
after she killed herself, and again

37:42.113 --> 37:43.419
after your daughter was diagnosed.

37:46.901 --> 37:48.748
Feeling powerless made you angry.

37:48.772 --> 37:51.316
Anger is a secondary feeling, Dan.

37:51.340 --> 37:52.535
A cover-up emotion that's masking

37:52.559 --> 37:55.494
what's really driving you. Guilt.

37:55.518 --> 37:57.409
Your anger's blocking
you from seeing that

37:57.433 --> 37:58.671
you blame yourself for buying your wife

37:58.695 --> 38:00.456
that genetic test.

38:01.244 --> 38:03.874
I don't want you to get sick.

38:04.368 --> 38:06.026
I... I know, Dad, please!

38:06.050 --> 38:07.724
Please, don't!

38:07.748 --> 38:09.210
Brit said,

38:09.663 --> 38:12.511
one of the things your wife
asked her to do before she died

38:12.535 --> 38:14.537
was to take care of you.

38:16.191 --> 38:18.919
You kill yourself, you, you blow
these people up, then

38:18.943 --> 38:20.780
she failed.

38:20.804 --> 38:22.782
You've already killed one person.

38:22.806 --> 38:24.809
And you nearly killed
your own daughter today.

38:25.685 --> 38:27.483
Put down the detonator and the gun, Dan.

38:28.433 --> 38:30.379
Don't... don't
make your daughter a failure.

38:44.350 --> 38:45.414
I'm sorry.

38:45.438 --> 38:46.415
I love you, Dad!

38:46.439 --> 38:48.357
I love you, too. Brit, come on.

38:48.381 --> 38:50.419
- Come on, come on, it's okay.
- Oh... no!

38:50.443 --> 38:51.420
No.

38:55.796 --> 38:57.251
Yeah, we got him, we got him.

38:57.275 --> 38:58.276
All right, we're clear.

39:00.366 --> 39:02.411
All right, bring in the bomb squad.

39:17.634 --> 39:19.482
We spoke to Malcolm.

39:20.198 --> 39:22.755
And he's pressuring the
health insurance companies

39:22.779 --> 39:24.202
to rescind their cancellations.

39:25.768 --> 39:27.006
I won't hold my breath.

39:27.031 --> 39:28.873
Hey, Brit, I wanted to show you this.

39:29.656 --> 39:31.634
There's a lot of different
research projects

39:31.658 --> 39:33.336
looking for a cure for Huntington's.

39:34.233 --> 39:37.168
I know it feels
like a slim chance, but, uh,

39:37.193 --> 39:38.508
it's reason to hope.

39:40.134 --> 39:43.472
Brit, I made some soup. You should eat.

39:43.496 --> 39:44.847
You haven't all day.

39:45.498 --> 39:46.649
Yeah, it's a good idea,

39:47.225 --> 39:49.391
- and, uh, we should be going.
- Yeah.

39:49.415 --> 39:51.771
- Take care, Brit.
- Thank you.

39:52.723 --> 39:54.247
Jed.

40:14.396 --> 40:16.418
Wanted to thank you guys, Philly style,

40:16.442 --> 40:17.419
with a cheesesteak.

40:17.443 --> 40:19.715
Oh, uh, well, you...

40:21.038 --> 40:23.060
You know, I would love to, um,

40:23.085 --> 40:24.976
but I have some other... business

40:25.001 --> 40:26.761
to attend to.

40:27.017 --> 40:29.605
Guess it's just us, then.
What do you say?

40:29.629 --> 40:31.477
Yeah, sure. Why not?

40:32.000 --> 40:35.066
So, where does one get the best
Philly cheesesteak in town?

40:35.091 --> 40:36.634
First of all, it's just cheesesteak.

40:36.659 --> 40:38.289
"Philly's" a given.

40:38.314 --> 40:40.331
You have a lot of learn, Mr. Profiler.

40:40.638 --> 40:42.280
Don't ever call me that.

40:45.908 --> 40:48.319
So... how was Philadelphia?

40:48.343 --> 40:50.495
I barely saw any of it.

40:50.519 --> 40:53.120
You know, this job just made me realize

40:53.144 --> 40:54.767
how lucky we are.

40:54.792 --> 40:55.960
How so?

40:56.656 --> 40:59.145
Well, families that have been through

40:59.169 --> 41:00.965
what you and I have been through?

41:01.661 --> 41:04.302
Second chances at a future
together don't often come.

41:05.394 --> 41:08.389
Promise me that we will
make the best of it.

41:09.451 --> 41:10.808
I promise.

41:13.020 --> 41:15.564
We've been back in
each other's lives six months.

41:15.938 --> 41:17.315
To many more.

41:26.033 --> 41:28.163
Ugh. Work.

41:28.187 --> 41:29.610
I got to explain to the new guy

41:29.634 --> 41:31.362
how to start the sourdough.

41:31.386 --> 41:32.469
- Yeah?
- Catch up to you?

41:32.493 --> 41:33.497
Yeah.

41:39.069 --> 41:40.264
Hello.

41:40.289 --> 41:41.714
Where's the laptop?

41:42.281 --> 41:43.475
Yeah, I got it.

41:43.598 --> 41:45.801
Bring it to me now.
