- AND THUS THE STUDENT
BECOMES THE MASTER.

09:02.917 --> 09:04.752
- WE'RE SORRY
TO INTERRUPT, MR. SUMMERS,

09:04.835 --> 09:06.629
BUT JAMES HERE
HAS TOLD ME SOMETHING

09:06.712 --> 09:09.423
A LITTLE DISTURBING ABOUT WHY
HE COULDN'T DO HIS HOMEWORK.

09:09.507 --> 09:10.967
- WELL, OF COURSE.
COME ON IN.

09:11.050 --> 09:12.468
- JAMES, IT'S OKAY.

09:12.551 --> 09:14.136
YOU CAN TELL THE PRINCIPAL
WHAT HAPPENED

09:14.220 --> 09:15.304
IN YOUR HOUSE LAST NIGHT.

09:15.388 --> 09:16.514
- REALLY?

09:16.597 --> 09:19.809
HE SEEMS TOO BUSY
TO LISTEN TO MY LITTLE TROUBLES.

09:19.892 --> 09:22.311
I GUESS I'LL JUST
SCOOT ON BACK TO CLASS.

09:22.395 --> 09:24.313
GOOD TALK.

09:24.397 --> 09:27.650
- OH, I'M NEVER TOO BUSY
FOR ONE OF MY STUDENTS, JAMES.

09:27.733 --> 09:30.861
GO AHEAD AND TELL ME
WHAT YOU TOLD MRS. MARCHANT.

09:30.945 --> 09:33.864
- WELL, I WANTED
TO DO MY HOMEWORK.

09:33.948 --> 09:35.324
OF COURSE, I DO LOVE FRACTIONS.

09:35.408 --> 09:40.621
1/2, 5/8,
CRAZY STUFF.

09:40.705 --> 09:42.915
BUT I COULDN'T
BECAUSE MY PARENTS

09:42.999 --> 09:45.126
LOCKED ME IN THE BASEMENT.

09:46.752 --> 09:48.671
- YOU CAN SEE
WHY I BROUGHT HIM DOWN HERE.

09:48.754 --> 09:51.007
- YES.

09:51.090 --> 09:53.384
TELL ME MORE
ABOUT YOUR TIME IN THE BASEMENT.

09:53.467 --> 09:55.428
- WELL, YOU KNOW BASEMENTS.

09:55.511 --> 10:00.474
THEY'RE ALL DARK
AND I HAVE TO SIT ON THE DRYER.

10:00.558 --> 10:02.476
- WHY WOULD YOU HAVE
TO SIT ON THE DRYER?

10:02.560 --> 10:03.686
- GLAD YOU ASKED.

10:03.769 --> 10:04.478
'CAUSE...

10:04.562 --> 10:08.065
THE FLOOR'S TOO SCARY.

10:08.149 --> 10:10.860
- WHY IS THE FLOOR SCARY?

10:10.943 --> 10:13.154
- BECAUSE OF...

10:13.237 --> 10:15.239
GATORS.

10:17.116 --> 10:18.951
- GATORS.
- YEAH, THAT'S IT.

10:19.035 --> 10:21.370
BECAUSE YOU KNOW HOW PEOPLE
FLUSH GATORS DOWN THE TOILET

10:21.454 --> 10:22.747
AND THEY GO INTO THE SEWERS?

10:22.830 --> 10:24.040
WELL, ONE GOT UP
INTO OUR BASEMENT

10:24.123 --> 10:28.419
AND NOW IT'S GIANT
FROM EATING ALL OUR RATS.

10:31.088 --> 10:35.468
- I PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE ASKED
SOME FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS FIRST.

10:35.551 --> 10:38.679
- WELL, JAMES,
THAT'S A VERY SAD STORY

10:38.763 --> 10:39.805
THAT YOU'VE TOLD.

10:39.889 --> 10:41.724
- I KNOW,
BUT IT'S OKAY.

10:41.807 --> 10:44.560
I'M TOUGH.

10:44.644 --> 10:47.730
- I MEAN IT'S SAD
THAT YOU THOUGHT I'D BELIEVE IT.

10:47.813 --> 10:49.732
YOU'RE LYING.

10:49.815 --> 10:51.692
AND LYING HAS CONSEQUENCES.

10:51.776 --> 10:53.569
FOR INSTANCE,
YOU WILL SPEND LUNCH TODAY

10:53.652 --> 10:57.698
IN DETENTION
DOING THAT HOMEWORK.

10:57.782 --> 10:59.075
- THAT'S NOT FAIR.

10:59.158 --> 11:01.827
I ONLY LIED BECAUSE MY STEPMOM
SAID IT WAS OKAY.

11:01.911 --> 11:03.746
SHE SAID LYING
IS AN ACT OF KINDNESS

11:03.829 --> 11:05.790
THAT HELPS A PERSON
GET THROUGH THE DAY.

11:08.334 --> 11:12.088
SO HOW YOUR DAY GOING?

11:16.384 --> 11:17.760
- OOH, HEY, HONEY.
- HEY.

11:17.843 --> 11:19.428
- YOU'RE HERE
BEFORE ME.

11:19.512 --> 11:21.680
LOOK, YOU DON'T NEED
TO TAKE OFF WORK FOR THIS, OKAY?

11:21.764 --> 11:22.848
I CAN HANDLE IT.

11:22.932 --> 11:24.433
WHY DON'T YOU
GO BACK TO THE HOSPITAL

11:24.517 --> 11:26.435
AND DO SOME OF THAT
HEART FIX-Y STUFF?

11:27.853 --> 11:30.731
- NOW, NOW, THAT'S SWEET,
BUT I'M ALREADY HERE.

11:30.815 --> 11:31.774
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOTTEN INTO JAMES.

11:31.857 --> 11:34.151
HE'S PULLED
A LOT OF STUNTS BEFORE,

11:34.235 --> 11:36.153
BUT HE'S NEVER LIED
TO HIS TEACHERS.

11:36.237 --> 11:38.239
- YEAH, BUT THIS IS JUST
GONNA GET YOU UPSET.

11:38.322 --> 11:41.325
SO WHY DON'T YOU GO,
AND I'LL FILL YOU IN AT HOME.

11:41.409 --> 11:43.744
- OH, STEPHANIE,
I'M NOT LEAVING.

11:43.828 --> 11:46.497
- WELL, THEN I'LL GO.
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

11:46.580 --> 11:50.668
HE SPECIFICALLY SAID
THAT HE WANTED BOTH OF US HERE.

11:50.751 --> 11:52.336
I WONDER WHY.

11:52.420 --> 11:55.423
- I BET HE'S GIVING US
A BIG OLD TROPHY

11:55.506 --> 11:59.635
FOR BEING THE BEST PARENTS EVER.

11:59.718 --> 12:00.928
- TROPHY.

12:01.011 --> 12:02.304
YOU DIDN'T SPEND MUCH TIME

12:02.388 --> 12:04.014
IN YOUR SCHOOL PRINCIPAL'S
OFFICE, DID YOU?

12:04.098 --> 12:04.723
- NOT REALLY.

12:04.807 --> 12:06.767
BECAUSE I'M GOOD.

12:06.851 --> 12:08.686
IT'S IMPORTANT
YOU REMEMBER THAT, CHARLIE.

12:08.769 --> 12:10.479
I'M GOOD.

12:10.563 --> 12:13.065
- SORRY TO KEEP YOU WAITING.

12:13.149 --> 12:15.067
PLEASE HAVE A SEAT.

12:15.151 --> 12:16.944
BOYS' ROOM TOILET BACKED UP.

12:17.027 --> 12:18.154
STATE CUTBACKS.

12:18.237 --> 12:20.614
GLAD I GOT THAT PhD.

12:24.326 --> 12:28.664
"A NON-LITERAL
SHADING OF REALITY."

12:28.747 --> 12:29.957
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA

12:30.040 --> 12:33.335
WHERE JAMES WOULD LEARN TO
JUSTIFY LYING LIKE THAT?

12:33.419 --> 12:34.378
- [scoffs]

12:34.462 --> 12:35.880
PLAYGROUNDS.

12:35.963 --> 12:36.672
NEIGHBOR'S KIDS.

12:36.755 --> 12:38.883
THEY ARE KIND OF SKETCHY.

12:38.966 --> 12:40.843
THE LITTLE GIRL
WITH THE RAT FACE.

12:45.264 --> 12:48.017
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
IT WAS ME.

12:48.100 --> 12:49.185
BUT MY MOTHER STARTED IT.

12:49.268 --> 12:50.811
- I CAN SEE WHY JAMES
IS HAVING SOME TROUBLE

12:50.895 --> 12:53.981
TAKING RESPONSIBILITY
FOR HIS ACTIONS.

12:54.064 --> 12:56.275
- YOU TOLD JAMES
TO LIE.

12:56.358 --> 12:57.735
- NO, NO, NO.

12:57.818 --> 12:59.403
I WAS LYING,

12:59.487 --> 13:01.363
AND I WAS EXPLAINING
WHY IT WASN'T A LIE.

13:01.447 --> 13:03.699
AND THAT'S THE TRUTH.

13:03.782 --> 13:06.660
CHARLIE,
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

13:06.744 --> 13:09.205
I GOT OVERWHELMED WITH ALL
OF THIS NEW PARENTING STUFF,

13:09.288 --> 13:10.915
AND A LITTLE LIE
HERE AND THERE MADE IT EASIER,

13:10.998 --> 13:13.375
AND I GUESS I JUST STARTED
DOING IT KIND OF A LOT.

13:13.459 --> 13:14.210
- WHAT'S A LOT?

13:14.293 --> 13:15.211
- WELL, IF YOU'RE TALKING

13:15.294 --> 13:16.337
ABOUT LAST NIGHT,
THAT WAS REAL.

13:16.420 --> 13:18.672
YOU'RE AMAZING.

13:20.424 --> 13:22.301
LOOK, I NEVER THOUGHT
MY LYING

13:22.384 --> 13:23.219
WOULD MAKE JAMES LIE.

13:23.302 --> 13:24.678
- WELL, THAT'S WHAT KIDS DO.

13:24.762 --> 13:26.222
THEY FOLLOW YOUR EXAMPLE.

13:26.305 --> 13:27.223
- HONEY, I AM SO SORRY.

13:27.306 --> 13:29.558
I FEEL AWFUL.

13:29.642 --> 13:30.809
I REALLY BLEW IT.

13:30.893 --> 13:33.229
- OH, LOOK.
HONESTY'S BACK.

13:33.312 --> 13:35.648
- I WAS BEING HONEST
WHEN I SAID YOU WERE AMAZING.

13:35.731 --> 13:38.567
- OKAY, WE'RE DONE HERE.

13:38.651 --> 13:40.694
[funky music]

13:40.778 --> 13:43.239
- BIG SMILES AGAIN,
EVERYONE.

13:43.322 --> 13:44.990
THIS IS GONNA BE MY WALLPAPER.

13:45.074 --> 13:47.535
[all groaning]

13:47.618 --> 13:48.452
COME ON, NOW.

13:48.536 --> 13:49.912
WE CAN BE HERE
ALL DAY LONG.

13:49.995 --> 13:53.666
I GOT A VERY STEADY HAND
AND NOWHERE TO GO.

13:56.418 --> 13:58.212
[camera clicks]

13:58.295 --> 13:59.838
NOPE. NOPE.

13:59.922 --> 14:01.549
THAT'S A PICTURE OF ME AGAIN.

14:01.632 --> 14:02.841
- [groans]
- THERE'S ONLY THREE BUTTONS.

14:02.925 --> 14:04.843
- AND THEY ALL
DO THE WRONG THING.

14:09.098 --> 14:11.016
- FAMILY MEETING.
NOW.

14:11.100 --> 14:12.226
- DAD, WE'RE RIGHT HERE.

14:15.437 --> 14:16.689
- GOOD.

14:18.524 --> 14:20.651
- YOU SEE THIS FACE?

14:20.734 --> 14:22.069
[camera clicks]

14:22.152 --> 14:23.279
YOU DID THIS.

14:23.362 --> 14:24.780
- I GOT THAT ONE.

14:24.863 --> 14:28.367
WHOA, YOU'RE MAD.

14:28.450 --> 14:30.619
- OKAY, EVERYBODY TAKE A SEAT.

14:33.872 --> 14:35.165
GOOD.

14:35.249 --> 14:39.545
WE NEED TO TALK
ABOUT VALUES.

14:39.628 --> 14:41.338
THIS FAMILY
TELLS THE TRUTH

14:41.422 --> 14:43.549
NO MATTER WHAT.

14:43.632 --> 14:45.593
BUT THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN TODAY.

14:45.676 --> 14:47.136
- THIS HAS A COMPASS.

14:47.219 --> 14:49.513
WHAT I NEED WITH A COMPASS?

14:49.597 --> 14:50.639
- TO FIND YOUR WAY HOME.

14:50.723 --> 14:54.101
THAT SEEMS TO BE A PROBLEM.

14:54.184 --> 14:57.104
- HEY, LIAR LIAR
AND PANTS ON FIRE.

14:59.023 --> 15:02.151
YOU MIGHT WANT
TO BOTH PAY ATTENTION.

15:02.234 --> 15:04.820
YOU CAN NEVER GO WRONG
TELLING THE TRUTH.

15:04.903 --> 15:07.573
HONESTY HAS ITS REWARDS.

15:07.656 --> 15:08.699
YES.

15:08.782 --> 15:12.828
- I TOOK $20
FROM YOUR WALLET YESTERDAY.

15:14.747 --> 15:15.748
- AH.
YOU'RE GROUNDED.

15:15.831 --> 15:18.917
- WHAT?
WHERE'S MY REWARD?

15:20.794 --> 15:21.837
- ANYONE ELSE?

15:21.920 --> 15:24.340
- JAMES ALSO BROKE THE REMOTE.
- HEY.

15:24.423 --> 15:26.342
- AND HE SCRATCHED
STEPHANIE'S CAR WITH HIS BIKE.

15:26.425 --> 15:29.386
- HE MEANT BE HONEST
ABOUT YOURSELF.

15:32.514 --> 15:34.183
- YOU SCRATCHED MY CAR

15:34.266 --> 15:36.560
AND THEN YOU WATCHED ME
MAKE A VALET CRY?

15:36.644 --> 15:39.188
- YEAH, WELL,
GABBY BROKE THE BATHROOM WINDOW.

15:39.271 --> 15:40.648
- THAT WAS YOU.
- YUP.

15:40.731 --> 15:43.817
- NOW, I BROKE
THE KITCHEN WINDOW.

15:43.901 --> 15:47.363
I NEED TO STOP TALKING.

15:49.615 --> 15:52.576
- OKAY, YOU OWE ME $20,

15:52.660 --> 15:54.620
A NEW REMOTE, SOME WINDOWS--

15:54.703 --> 15:57.414
I'VE LOST TRACK.

15:57.498 --> 15:58.540
BUT TWO WEEKS
WITH NO ELECTRONICS

15:58.624 --> 15:59.667
FOR LYING AT SCHOOL.

15:59.750 --> 16:03.379
- DID YOU KNOW THAT'S NORTH?

16:04.797 --> 16:06.882
- SO YOU NEVER LIE, DADDY?

16:06.965 --> 16:08.884
- THAT'S RIGHT.

16:08.967 --> 16:11.261
THAT'S HOW I WAS RAISED.

16:11.345 --> 16:14.139
- MM-HMM.

16:14.223 --> 16:16.558
- "MM-HMM"?
WHAT "MM-HMM"?

16:16.642 --> 16:18.519
- NOTHING.
- NO, SAY IT.

16:18.602 --> 16:20.729
- I JUST REMEMBER ONE TIME
YOU WEREN'T VERY HONEST.

16:20.813 --> 16:24.024
- WHEN?
- WHEN WE FIRST MET.

16:24.108 --> 16:25.484
- UH, NAME IT.

16:25.567 --> 16:27.236
DON'T MAKE THE ACCUSATION
IF YOU CAN'T BACK IT UP.

16:27.319 --> 16:28.404
- FINE.

16:28.487 --> 16:30.948
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME
YOU WERE DIVORCED

16:31.031 --> 16:32.324
UNTIL OUR THIRD DATE

16:32.408 --> 16:34.743
OR THAT YOU HAD KIDS
UNTIL OUR FOURTH.

16:34.827 --> 16:36.245
- WHAT?
- THAT'S MESSED UP.

16:36.328 --> 16:39.081
- WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL HER
ABOUT US, DADDY?

16:39.164 --> 16:43.502
- BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW
HOW SERIOUS

16:43.585 --> 16:44.878
THE RELATIONSHIP
WAS GONNA GET.

16:44.962 --> 16:46.296
- IS THAT RIGHT?

16:46.380 --> 16:49.216
WE HAD A PRETTY SERIOUS
SECOND DATE, IF I RECALL.

16:49.299 --> 16:50.676
- WE PROBABLY WOULDN'T HAVE HAD

16:50.759 --> 16:52.720
A PRETTY SERIOUS SECOND DATE
IF I HAD TOLD YOU.

16:52.803 --> 16:55.139
- SO IT'S OKAY TO LIE IF IT
MEANS GETTING WHAT YOU WANT.

16:55.222 --> 16:56.515
- NO, I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

16:56.598 --> 16:57.433
- THAT'S WHAT IT SOUNDED LIKE.
- YEAH, IT DID.

16:57.516 --> 17:01.520
- MM-HMM.

17:01.603 --> 17:02.813
- THIS IS GROWN-UP TALK.

17:02.896 --> 17:05.148
WE'LL CONTINUE
WITH THIS CONVERSATION LATER.

17:05.232 --> 17:06.775
COME HERE.

17:06.858 --> 17:07.943
- YES!

17:08.026 --> 17:10.319
I THINK I GOT THAT
ALL ON VIDEO.

17:12.030 --> 17:15.117
AND WHAT I JUST SAID
ON VIDEO.

17:15.200 --> 17:16.743
AND WHAT I JUST JUST SAID.

17:16.827 --> 17:18.494
OKAY, HOW DO YOU TURN OFF
THE VIDEO?

17:22.040 --> 17:24.334
- WHAT WERE YOU THINKING
SPILLING ALL THAT TO THE KIDS?

17:24.417 --> 17:28.547
- YOU TIPPED ME OVER
AND IT JUST CAME POURING OUT.

17:28.630 --> 17:30.549
- THERE IS A DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN ADULT HONESTY

17:30.632 --> 17:31.425
AND KID HONESTY.

17:31.508 --> 17:33.844
- OH, I THOUGHT WE WERE
A FAMILY

17:33.927 --> 17:35.471
THAT TOLD THE TRUTH
NO MATTER WHAT.

17:35.554 --> 17:36.930
- BUT THERE ARE THINGS CHILDREN
DON'T NEED TO KNOW.

17:37.014 --> 17:38.307
- AND THAT'S WHEN
YOU LIE TO THEM?

17:38.390 --> 17:39.892
- NO, THAT'S WHERE I AVOID
SITUATIONS

17:39.975 --> 17:42.227
WHERE I'D HAVE TO LIE.

17:42.311 --> 17:42.811
- OH, REALLY?

17:42.895 --> 17:44.480
LET'S SEE.

17:47.399 --> 17:50.402
- OH, HEY!
OH.

17:50.486 --> 17:51.904
I NEED A KID.

17:51.987 --> 17:53.906
- WAIT, I WANT TO SEE THIS.
- EXCUSE ME! HEY!

17:53.989 --> 17:57.159
- LET'S PLAY A GAME.
- OKAY.

17:57.242 --> 17:59.661
- GEORGE WASHINGTON.
REAL OR NOT REAL?

17:59.745 --> 18:01.079
- REAL.
WHAT DO I WIN?

18:01.163 --> 18:03.707
- NOT YET.
SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS.

18:03.791 --> 18:07.669
- NOT REAL.
DUH.

18:07.753 --> 18:08.879
- SANTA.
- REAL.

18:08.962 --> 18:09.880
- EASTER BUNNY.
- REAL.

18:09.963 --> 18:10.839
- THE TOOTH FAIRY.

18:10.923 --> 18:14.051
- A WHOLE DOLLAR WORTH OF REAL.

18:14.134 --> 18:15.344
- THANKS FOR PLAYING.

18:15.427 --> 18:16.428
YOU CAN GO.

18:16.512 --> 18:17.721
- DON'T I GET A PRIZE?

18:17.805 --> 18:19.223
- HOW ABOUT A HUG?

18:19.306 --> 18:20.182
- THAT'S A STUPID GAME.

18:24.186 --> 18:25.771
- OKAY, FINE.

18:25.854 --> 18:27.523
BUT WE ARE NOT KIDS.

18:27.606 --> 18:29.233
BETWEEN US, THERE NEEDS TO BE
COMPLETE HONESTY.

18:29.316 --> 18:31.860

YOU WANT TO GO THERE?

18:31.944 --> 18:33.111
- OF COURSE.

18:33.195 --> 18:34.404
- FINE.

18:34.488 --> 18:37.783
YOU'RE STARTING TO GROW HAIR
OUT OF YOUR EARS.

18:37.866 --> 18:39.243
- I AM NOT.

18:39.326 --> 18:40.369
[laughs]

18:40.452 --> 18:42.371
HAIR OUT OF MY EAR.

18:56.510 --> 19:01.181
I BET HE BOUGHT HER
A NUMBER FOUR COMBO MEAL.

19:01.265 --> 19:05.435

THAT SOUNDS ABOUT RIGHT.

19:05.519 --> 19:08.772
- HEY, WHO PUT THE EMPTY
MILK CARTON BACK IN HERE?

19:08.856 --> 19:09.898
- IT DEPENDS.

19:09.982 --> 19:12.401
ARE WE STILL DOING
THAT HONESTY THING?

19:12.484 --> 19:13.652
- IT'S NOT A THING.

19:13.735 --> 19:15.070
IT'S A WAY OF LIFE.

19:15.153 --> 19:16.446
ALL RIGHT, COME ON, GUYS.
EVERYBODY UP.

19:16.530 --> 19:17.656

- HI, HI, HI.

19:27.332 --> 19:28.333
SO I'M ON THE FACE THING.

19:28.417 --> 19:30.711
WHO'S GONNA HELP ME
SET UP MY PAGE?

19:30.794 --> 19:32.504
- SORRY, IN THE MIDDLE
OF A HEART TRANSPLANT.

19:32.588 --> 19:33.547
JUST CAME HOME
FOR JUICE.

19:33.630 --> 19:34.590
- I'VE GOT JURY DUTY.

19:34.673 --> 19:35.173
- HOMEWORK.

19:37.843 --> 19:39.344
- COMPUTERS AREN'T REAL.

19:42.890 --> 19:45.601
- JAMES, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

19:45.684 --> 19:47.477
I TOLD YOU TO RAKE UP THE LEAVES
OUT FRONT.

19:47.561 --> 19:49.104
- I WAS DOING THAT,
AND THEN I GOT SCARED.

19:49.187 --> 19:52.566
- WHY?
THERE'S GATORS OUT THERE?

19:52.649 --> 19:54.610
- WORSE.

19:54.693 --> 19:57.654
CLOWNS. LOTS OF THEM.

19:57.738 --> 19:58.822
- SERIOUSLY, CLOWNS?

19:58.906 --> 20:02.576

[doorbell rings]

20:05.871 --> 20:09.124
- JAMES, I CAN'T BELIEVE AFTER
EVERYTHING WE'VE BEEN THROUGH,

20:09.207 --> 20:10.959
YOU'RE LYING TO US AGAIN.

20:15.172 --> 20:18.634
- HEY, LADY.

20:18.717 --> 20:19.968
OUR CAR BROKE DOWN
