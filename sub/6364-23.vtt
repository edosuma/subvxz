00:01.168 --> 00:03.769
Who have you talked to
since nadia died?

00:03.771 --> 00:06.372
Well, she didn't die.
She was murdered.

00:06.374 --> 00:09.008
You win, hank.
You were the better parent.

00:09.010 --> 00:11.510
And you're gonna repay me
by staying out of erin's life.

00:11.512 --> 00:14.713
If you wanna talk,
i am so here for you.

00:14.715 --> 00:16.114
Hey, landon.

00:16.117 --> 00:19.184

00:35.536 --> 00:36.802
How you doin', buddy?

00:36.804 --> 00:38.370
Commander perry.

00:38.372 --> 00:39.671
- Thanks for taking the time
- of course.

00:39.673 --> 00:41.774
This is my nephew, carter.

00:41.776 --> 00:43.542
Son.

00:43.544 --> 00:45.394
I don't feel right
about being out here,

00:45.395 --> 00:47.245
But our uncle swears that
if anyone can handle this,

00:47.248 --> 00:49.648
It's you.

00:49.650 --> 00:51.250
All right.
What ya got?

00:51.252 --> 00:54.153
My cut.
I had to take it.

00:54.155 --> 00:57.089
If i didn't,
they'd think i was a snitch.

00:57.091 --> 00:58.791
Last week,
we came into chicago,

00:58.793 --> 01:00.359
Hit a mid-level supplier
in englewood

01:00.361 --> 01:03.062
Using a fake warrant.

01:03.064 --> 01:05.197
Startin' to spill
into your backyard, hank.

01:05.199 --> 01:07.199
These guys
are crazy, all right?

01:07.201 --> 01:08.801
The last dealer we hit,
they beat him so bad,

01:08.803 --> 01:10.669
I thought they'd kill him.

01:10.671 --> 01:13.238
Well, what about your chief?
You go to him about this?

01:13.240 --> 01:15.741
Like i told my uncle--
i don't know who i can trust.

01:15.743 --> 01:17.843
For all i know,
they could be payin' him off.

01:17.845 --> 01:19.578
You gotta get carter
from under them, hank.

01:19.580 --> 01:21.613
It's just a matter of time
before they bust this whole unit

01:21.615 --> 01:24.416
And take him down
the tubes with him.

01:35.663 --> 01:38.464
Why don't you
just shut it off?

01:38.466 --> 01:41.533
I can't. It's work.

01:43.771 --> 01:47.606
What'd you talk me
into last night?

01:47.608 --> 01:50.476
Oh.
Everything.

01:50.478 --> 01:52.678
[scoffs]

01:54.215 --> 01:56.615
Remember when we went
to rocklahoma?

01:56.617 --> 02:01.153
I remember using a fake id
to get in, and...

02:01.155 --> 02:02.721
Limp bizkit opening.

02:02.723 --> 02:04.356
After that,
it's kind of a blur.

02:04.358 --> 02:07.893
I got tickets for this year.
What do you say?

02:07.895 --> 02:10.863
Old road dogs
reliving the good times?

02:10.865 --> 02:13.365
We could forget
all this nadia business.

02:13.367 --> 02:16.869
I said
don't mention her name.

02:16.871 --> 02:19.771
Lock it when you leave.

02:19.773 --> 02:22.541
All right, here's the deal.

02:22.543 --> 02:24.710
Commander's nephew's
caught up with some bad police

02:24.712 --> 02:26.879
Out in jackson park.

02:26.881 --> 02:29.681
This is sergeant dave roland
and his narcotics unit.

02:29.683 --> 02:31.450
Over the past year,
they've been ripping off

02:31.452 --> 02:33.585
Drug dealers
in their jurisdiction.

02:33.587 --> 02:35.220
Until last week
when they crossed

02:35.222 --> 02:37.756
Into our backyard--
robbed a stash house for 200k.

02:37.758 --> 02:39.892
I got a buddy from high school

02:39.894 --> 02:41.777
Used to work out that way
as a sheriff's deputy.

02:41.778 --> 02:43.661
He said the motto on the side
of the jackson park patrol car

02:43.664 --> 02:46.832
Should read,
"to steal and neglect."

02:46.834 --> 02:48.834
Sorry. Traffic.

02:48.836 --> 02:52.337
Sir. Ahem.

02:52.339 --> 02:55.807
Sergeant roland
used to cpd.

02:55.809 --> 02:57.342
Some of you
may recognize his name.

02:57.344 --> 02:59.311
His father was deputy chief.

02:59.313 --> 03:01.313
He had his son placed
in narcotics

03:01.315 --> 03:03.615
Straight outta the academy.

03:03.617 --> 03:05.184
Everybody knew
he was bad news back then--

03:05.186 --> 03:07.920
Got jammed up,
excessive force charges--

03:07.922 --> 03:09.488
Look, before he could
get stripped,

03:09.490 --> 03:11.623
His old man had him shipped
out to jackson park

03:11.625 --> 03:13.659
To save his career.

03:13.661 --> 03:16.228
Carter.
He's been a patrol officer

03:16.230 --> 03:17.963
Out there the past two years.

03:17.965 --> 03:19.865
Nothin' but high marks.

03:19.867 --> 03:21.500
About six months ago,
he got assigned

03:21.502 --> 03:23.869
To roland's narcotics unit.

03:23.871 --> 03:27.339
Thought it'd
be a career changer for him.

03:27.341 --> 03:29.374
Listen, it's just
a matter of time

03:29.376 --> 03:32.678
Before roland and his unit
realize carter isn't one of 'em.

03:32.680 --> 03:34.446
So how are we gonna play this?

03:36.617 --> 03:39.618
My office.

03:43.724 --> 03:45.824
- Listen, before you say...
- Sit down.

03:50.264 --> 03:51.863
Aaron, perry came to us
with this case

03:51.865 --> 03:53.865
Because he needs
our help, okay?

03:53.867 --> 03:55.634
It could get tricky.

03:55.636 --> 03:59.504
I got a plan,
but i also got a problem--

03:59.506 --> 04:02.507
I don't know
if i can rely on you.

04:02.509 --> 04:04.243
Hank.

04:04.245 --> 04:06.912
I can't count how many
times you've been late.

04:06.914 --> 04:09.481
You look like you've been
up all night.

04:09.483 --> 04:12.551
The question is...

04:14.388 --> 04:17.789
Can i count on you?
Yes or no?

04:17.791 --> 04:20.858
Yes.

04:26.667 --> 04:28.967
Well, you wouldn't believe it
unless you were there.

04:28.969 --> 04:30.969
Me and jackson took
a halligan hook

04:30.971 --> 04:32.504
To this giant's head.

04:32.506 --> 04:35.007
The guy was no less
than 6'5", 300 pounds,

04:35.009 --> 04:36.875
Waving around
his little derringer.

04:36.877 --> 04:40.712
[all laughing]

04:40.714 --> 04:43.482
Can we help you with something?

04:43.484 --> 04:44.983
Yeah--
i'd like to know how

04:44.985 --> 04:47.919
A bunch of cops from suburbia
got the balls to cross over

04:47.921 --> 04:50.756
Into the city,
rip off a dealer,

04:50.758 --> 04:52.024
And are eatin' burgers

04:52.026 --> 04:53.525
Like they don't have
a care in the world.

04:53.527 --> 04:55.327
[scoffs]

04:57.931 --> 05:00.999
Who the hell are you?

05:01.001 --> 05:04.436
Chicago pd.

05:04.438 --> 05:06.705
What is cpd doing
this far west?

05:06.707 --> 05:10.809
Hank voight sent me.

05:10.811 --> 05:13.378
We need to have a talk.

05:21.922 --> 05:23.922
So you and voight
are tight then?

05:23.924 --> 05:25.524
I gotta be honest--
i don't wanna be here.

05:25.526 --> 05:28.794
This place bores me,
but we have a serious problem.

05:30.030 --> 05:31.797
The dealer that you
and your unit robbed

05:31.799 --> 05:33.866
Was under voight's
protection.

05:33.867 --> 05:35.934
Whoa, you keep saying that--
robbed. You got any proof?

05:35.936 --> 05:37.703
Don't waste my time.

05:37.705 --> 05:41.540
You jacked our revenue stream,
so now you owe us.

05:41.542 --> 05:44.076
We have a target
we want you to hit.

05:44.078 --> 05:45.811
I wanna talk
to voight first.

05:45.813 --> 05:47.112
You're talking to me.

05:47.114 --> 05:48.947
No offense,
but i'm not doing business

05:48.949 --> 05:51.016
With his messenger girl.

05:54.421 --> 05:57.889
Great.
His cut just went up 15%.

06:00.761 --> 06:02.527
[engine starts]

06:02.529 --> 06:06.498
[laughter]

06:06.500 --> 06:08.400
Oh. What's up
with chuckles, here?

06:08.402 --> 06:10.435
[laughs]
nah, i just got off the phone

06:10.437 --> 06:11.903
With my fop rep.

06:11.905 --> 06:13.972
The suspect who committed
suicide in custody,

06:13.974 --> 06:16.541
I'm officially cleared
for his death, so...

06:16.543 --> 06:17.976
I told him he
shouldn't be nervous.

06:17.978 --> 06:21.046
Well, i guess you won't be
workin' mall security after all.

06:21.048 --> 06:22.814
But don't get your hopes up

06:22.816 --> 06:25.016
For gettin' back
upstairs anytime soon.

06:25.018 --> 06:28.653
I heard "golden girl"
is shining real bright up there.

06:28.655 --> 06:30.655
Yeah, well, you know,
i started on the streets.

06:30.657 --> 06:32.791
Now i'm back on the streets.
It's all good.

06:32.793 --> 06:34.493
Yeah, see,
that's a winning attitude.

06:34.495 --> 06:37.479
Yeah, he doesn't mean
a word of it.

06:37.480 --> 06:40.464
Hey, olinsky,
do you ever check you messages?

06:40.467 --> 06:42.801
Yeah, uh, how do i--
how do i do that?

06:42.803 --> 06:44.669
How do--

06:44.671 --> 06:48.473
A linda sovana keeps calling,
twice today already.

06:48.475 --> 06:49.908
You say sovana?

06:49.910 --> 06:51.543
Yeah, do me a favor--
call the woman back

06:51.545 --> 06:53.044
If for no other reason
than to tell her

06:53.046 --> 06:54.880
To stop calling me.

06:54.882 --> 06:58.717
- Ready?
- Yeah.

06:58.719 --> 07:00.419
- Oh, hey, kev.
- Hey.

07:00.421 --> 07:02.587
I got a call
from the ivory tower.

07:02.589 --> 07:03.855
Congratulations.

07:03.857 --> 07:05.924
I appreciate that, sarge.

07:05.926 --> 07:07.058
Hey we might need
a little extra backup

07:07.060 --> 07:09.194
On this thing we're working,
so stand by.

07:09.196 --> 07:11.463
Anything you need.

07:14.668 --> 07:18.737
If i'm not out in, like--
ten minutes, you come in.

07:18.739 --> 07:20.839
Okay.

07:33.620 --> 07:36.154
Sergeant voight,
this is sergeant roland.

07:40.561 --> 07:44.029
I don't know if you remember,
but we met once.

07:44.031 --> 07:47.999
Well, you're right.
I don't remember.

07:48.001 --> 07:49.701
How about a drink?

07:49.703 --> 07:51.503
It's not a social call.

07:51.505 --> 07:52.904
Well, i just gotta say,

07:52.906 --> 07:55.106
I have nothing
but respect for you.

07:55.108 --> 07:56.608
A cop who ran
the streets his way.

07:56.610 --> 07:58.176
You got sent to statesville,

07:58.178 --> 08:00.178
Gamed the system
to be released.

08:00.180 --> 08:03.148
I mean, when i was
coming up in cpd,

08:03.150 --> 08:05.817
I always wanted
to get in your unit.

08:05.819 --> 08:08.520
Now here we are,
finally workin' together.

08:08.522 --> 08:10.689
Not yet.

08:10.691 --> 08:13.692
You're right.
First thing's first.

08:13.694 --> 08:15.560
Your phones.

08:15.562 --> 08:17.596
Can never be too sure.

08:17.598 --> 08:19.898
Nowadays,
they got everything wired.

08:25.205 --> 08:28.240
Here's for the phones.

08:37.683 --> 08:40.150
I'm clean.

08:43.056 --> 08:46.658
I don't think you
fully understand this situation.

08:46.660 --> 08:50.896
You come into my city,
steal from me.

08:54.101 --> 08:57.636
The only reason
you're still breathing

08:57.638 --> 09:00.772
Is 'cause i don't
let debts go unpaid.

09:03.977 --> 09:05.911
We're cool.

09:10.817 --> 09:14.119
Target is a cartel stash house.
No real security.

09:14.121 --> 09:15.854
They pay a front man
to shovel the snow

09:15.856 --> 09:17.556
And pick up the mail.

09:17.558 --> 09:20.258
He's sittin' on at least
ten kilos and 200 grand in cash.

09:20.260 --> 09:23.028
- In and out in five minutes.
- You hit it, we'll split it.

09:23.030 --> 09:25.597
35 your end, 65 us.

09:25.599 --> 09:27.032
Sounds like me and my guys
are doing

09:27.034 --> 09:30.969
Most of the work,
so, i'd say that's 65 my way.

09:30.971 --> 09:33.204
You can have the whole thing.

09:33.206 --> 09:36.341
But then you gotta get
out of chicago alive.

09:40.781 --> 09:43.915
35's good this time.

09:43.917 --> 09:45.784
But 50/50 next time.

09:45.786 --> 09:49.854
Let's just worry about this job.
Goes good, we'll talk.

09:57.130 --> 09:58.263
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:58.265 --> 10:00.732
You left
without me this morning.

10:00.734 --> 10:02.200
Yeah, no, i had
some paperwork i had

10:02.202 --> 10:04.169
To catch up on, so i thought
i'd get an early start.

10:04.171 --> 10:06.271
- You had paperwork.
- Yeah.

10:06.273 --> 10:09.307
Look, i'm upstairs now.
You have to get used to it.

10:09.309 --> 10:12.110
Don't read into it.
Wha--i had paperwork.

10:12.112 --> 10:13.912
[sighing] okay.

10:14.848 --> 10:16.281
Hey, how much cash you got?

10:16.283 --> 10:17.782
On me?

10:17.784 --> 10:20.051
No, in the bank.

10:20.053 --> 10:22.721
I'm lookin' for a few partners
to go in on an investment.

10:22.723 --> 10:24.089
What do you know
about investing?

10:24.091 --> 10:26.858
Zip.
But i know boxing.

10:26.860 --> 10:28.627
It's matador's gym,
you've been there.

10:28.629 --> 10:29.894
Yeah.

10:29.896 --> 10:31.730
The owner and i, sergeant
hopkins, we go way back.

10:31.732 --> 10:33.999
He's on underwater
with the place, needs to sell.

10:34.001 --> 10:35.634
How much you need?

10:35.636 --> 10:38.303
100k total.
I already talked to roland,

10:38.305 --> 10:40.405
So i figure if we all put in
at least 25 for a down payment,

10:40.407 --> 10:42.874
Do i look like
a rockefeller to you?

10:42.876 --> 10:44.909
Well, whatever
you can come up with.

10:44.911 --> 10:47.345
Narcotics have been sitting
on a cartel stash house

10:47.347 --> 10:49.114
For several weeks.

10:49.116 --> 10:50.949
Sergeant mccants has been
kind enough

10:50.951 --> 10:52.917
To let us use it
as our bait house.

10:52.919 --> 10:54.953
So we take down a few bad cops

10:54.955 --> 10:56.855
And get some dope
off the streets.

10:56.857 --> 10:58.790
Now we gotta
make this look good.

10:58.792 --> 11:01.126
So as soon as we move in,
we cuff carter and lindsay

11:01.128 --> 11:02.661
And take 'em to lock up, too.

11:02.663 --> 11:04.763
- Got it?
- Got it.

11:13.740 --> 11:15.674
This is it.

11:15.676 --> 11:18.710
- Why are you all dolled up?
- Because voight says i go in.

11:18.712 --> 11:21.146
Just to make sure you
get the count right.

11:21.148 --> 11:23.882
If it goes off,
you better be ready.

11:25.419 --> 11:28.153
Everyone in position.

11:28.155 --> 11:31.356
Ready and waiting.

11:31.358 --> 11:34.059
We got eyes.

11:42.836 --> 11:45.804
- Don't you move!
Don't you move! Hands up!

11:45.806 --> 11:47.706
<i>Papi! </i>
[yelp]

11:47.708 --> 11:49.841
No! Baby!
What do you want?

11:49.843 --> 11:51.142
Don't play dumb.
You give up the stash

11:51.144 --> 11:52.844
Or you both die.

11:52.846 --> 11:55.046
Please,
just don't hurt her.

11:55.048 --> 11:57.716
- Come on!
- Where!

11:57.718 --> 12:00.885
The oven.

12:00.887 --> 12:04.389
- The cash! Where's the cash?
- I don't know.

12:04.391 --> 12:07.425
- I don't know!
- Come on, chico, come on!

12:07.427 --> 12:10.295
Okay. The fridge.

12:10.297 --> 12:12.430
What, do you got it on ice?

12:12.432 --> 12:15.166
- Got it.
- Count it.

12:19.072 --> 12:21.139
Uh, there's 100k,
give or take.

12:21.141 --> 12:22.273
- Where's the rest?
- I don't know!

12:22.275 --> 12:24.142
Daddy!

12:24.144 --> 12:25.410
- Baby! Wait! Wait!
- Whoa! Whoa!

12:25.412 --> 12:27.445
Relax! Everybody relax!

12:27.447 --> 12:30.115
- Get down. Get down!
[indistinct shouting]

12:30.117 --> 12:32.450
They always hide it
in the kids room.

12:35.355 --> 12:37.055
All right, tear it apart.

12:37.057 --> 12:40.208
- Please!
- Come here, baby.

12:40.209 --> 12:43.360
- Hold her, please. Hold her!
- On your knees. On your knees!

12:43.363 --> 12:45.864
Guys! Maybe our intel was off.

12:45.866 --> 12:49.267
Boss, there's no cash here.

12:49.269 --> 12:50.535
- No, no, no, no, no!
[girl screams]

12:50.537 --> 12:52.270
- No! No!
- Don't move!

12:52.272 --> 12:54.906
We know there' more.
You either tell me, or she dies.

12:54.908 --> 12:58.076
There's no more!
[woman crying]

13:04.417 --> 13:06.918
No, there's more.

13:06.920 --> 13:08.953
- Damn!
- There is no more!

13:08.955 --> 13:10.822
Let her go.

13:10.824 --> 13:12.641
- What are you doin'?
- Let her go.

13:12.642 --> 13:14.459
- What, are you gonna shoot me?
- We don't do it this way.

13:14.461 --> 13:18.296
This is not your show.
You take a step back.

13:18.298 --> 13:19.931
[gun cocks]
where's the money?

13:19.933 --> 13:22.433
- Where's the money?
- Sarge!

13:22.435 --> 13:25.036
Shots fired!
Everybody move in.

13:25.038 --> 13:28.540
[engine roars]

13:28.542 --> 13:30.141
- Drop your weapon!
- Put your gun down!

13:30.143 --> 13:31.943
- Stand down!
- I will drop you.

13:37.551 --> 13:39.117
- Don't move!
- Stand down.

13:39.119 --> 13:41.286
Antonio, you don't
need to do this.

13:41.288 --> 13:43.888
Drop your weapon.

13:43.890 --> 13:47.392
Get up!

13:47.394 --> 13:51.496
- You rat piece of--
- shut-up!

13:51.498 --> 13:53.298
You're under arrest.

13:53.300 --> 13:54.999
Get him out of here!

13:55.001 --> 13:58.102
You're breakin' my heart.

14:06.046 --> 14:07.979
You'll be shipped down
to 26 and cal and put

14:07.981 --> 14:10.148
In protective custody
until the hearing, tomorrow.

14:10.150 --> 14:12.617
If carter's the ace
up your sleeve,

14:12.619 --> 14:16.487
It won't be
much of a hearing.

14:16.489 --> 14:20.391
Hey, ask him
about 219 westlake terrace.

14:23.263 --> 14:25.964
Aah! Unh!

14:31.004 --> 14:32.437
I already got a call
from internal affairs

14:32.439 --> 14:34.572
About you doin a urine drop.

14:34.574 --> 14:36.040
Yeah, i'll do it
after the hearing.

14:36.042 --> 14:38.176
Well, it's mandatory
you get tested within 12 hours

14:38.178 --> 14:40.044
Of firing your weapon.
I wanna make sure

14:40.046 --> 14:43.114
Every t's crossed
in this case, so...

14:43.116 --> 14:45.583
Make sure you
head down there first thing.

14:45.585 --> 14:47.652
Okay.

14:51.057 --> 14:53.191
- Hey.
- Hey.

14:53.193 --> 14:55.059
Hey, you should probably
lay low for a bit,

14:55.061 --> 14:56.594
Until this
whole thing blows over.

14:56.596 --> 14:59.430
All right, he's gonna stay
with me out in st. Charles.

14:59.432 --> 15:02.500
Hey, what happened
to 219 westlake terrace?

15:02.502 --> 15:04.335
What do you mean?

15:04.337 --> 15:08.006
You tellin' me
everything i need to know?

15:08.008 --> 15:12.110
I got nothing to hide here.
I came to you, sergeant.

15:12.112 --> 15:17.582
Tell me the truth, hm?

15:17.584 --> 15:19.918
You stick your hand
in the cookie jar?

15:19.920 --> 15:22.353
Absolutely not.

15:22.355 --> 15:25.023
So why'd roland
mention that address?

15:25.025 --> 15:30.461
To get your head spinnin'.
Obviously it's workin'.

15:30.463 --> 15:34.165
Mm-hmm.

15:36.202 --> 15:39.237
Sergeant hopkins sank his
last 10k into this place.

15:39.239 --> 15:41.572
Still needs to get out
from under it.

15:41.574 --> 15:43.474
How long
you been coming here for?

15:43.476 --> 15:45.310
I was 14 when i first
walked in

15:45.312 --> 15:47.145
On my way home from work.

15:47.147 --> 15:48.646
Well, work was runnin'
dime bags

15:48.648 --> 15:51.616
For an sgd named hard boy,
he lived upstairs.

15:51.618 --> 15:54.052
He used to slap me around.

15:54.054 --> 15:56.187
But after a few lessons,
i showed him.

15:56.189 --> 15:58.456
I was at that point, you know?

15:58.458 --> 16:01.225
Fork in the road.

16:01.227 --> 16:02.727
Than this place
introduced me

16:02.729 --> 16:04.662
To the police,
youth boxing league.

16:04.664 --> 16:07.231
Saved my life.

16:07.233 --> 16:09.567
And it can do the same
for a lot of other kids.

16:09.569 --> 16:14.305
Listen, man.
All i can do is 10 grand.

16:14.307 --> 16:16.741
I can buy in for 5.

16:16.743 --> 16:20.011
[sighs]
that's not gonna be enough.

16:28.355 --> 16:30.455
It's funny.
I almost just called you frank.

16:30.457 --> 16:34.459
Well, when did you
find out i was a cop?

16:34.461 --> 16:38.062
It's been 16 years.

16:38.064 --> 16:41.065
No "good to see you"?

16:41.067 --> 16:43.134
Well, i'm not totally sure

16:43.136 --> 16:46.337
This is a good thing.

16:46.339 --> 16:48.439
I saw my cousin jimmy
a few days ago.

16:48.441 --> 16:49.774
Mm-hmm.

16:49.776 --> 16:51.776
You remember jimmy?

16:51.778 --> 16:53.711
He's out now and, uh--
he told me that he found out

16:53.713 --> 16:56.381
You were an undercover.

16:56.383 --> 16:57.749
Well, that case was only
supposed to last

16:57.751 --> 17:02.353
A couple of weeks,
but instead it went a year.

17:02.355 --> 17:04.622
Were you married then
when we were together?

17:10.597 --> 17:12.497
I was.

17:16.236 --> 17:18.236
Why--why'd you call, linda?

17:18.238 --> 17:20.171
Hm?

17:24.411 --> 17:27.478
You remember when i vouched
for you that one time?

17:27.480 --> 17:30.648
When cheero's crew was
asking about you?

17:30.650 --> 17:32.116
Mm-hmm.

17:32.118 --> 17:35.586
I saved your ass.
Would you agree?

17:35.588 --> 17:37.355
Yeah, i would.

17:37.357 --> 17:39.757
Good.
Just wanted to make sure

17:39.759 --> 17:42.193
You didn't forget that.

17:48.701 --> 17:51.302
Why did you sidestep
the proper channels

17:51.304 --> 17:53.371
When conducting
this investigation

17:53.373 --> 17:55.206
Sir, you know how my team works.

17:55.208 --> 17:56.741
We dive in head first.

17:56.743 --> 18:00.611
I had specific intel that
sergeant roland and his unit

18:00.613 --> 18:03.748
Was rippin' off drug dealers
for their money and narcotics.

18:03.750 --> 18:05.516
I would like to make it clear
that me and my guys

18:05.518 --> 18:07.485
Would not have been
at that house,

18:07.487 --> 18:09.287
Or anywhere near chicago
for that matter,

18:09.289 --> 18:11.089
If it hadn't been
for detective linds--

18:11.091 --> 18:15.626
Where is detective lindsay,
who shot my client?

18:15.628 --> 18:17.428
Sergeant?

18:17.430 --> 18:20.098
Detective lindsay got pulled
into another case.

18:20.100 --> 18:23.401
Until she goes on record
and we get a sworn statement

18:23.403 --> 18:26.637
From carter perry,
you have no case.

18:26.639 --> 18:29.140
Sergeant roland and his team
are being released

18:29.142 --> 18:30.675
Without charges
at this time.

18:30.677 --> 18:32.310
- Perfect.
- Yes.

18:32.312 --> 18:34.412
- Congratulations, boys.

18:44.858 --> 18:46.724
Bathroom is right over there.

18:46.726 --> 18:48.893
Thanks.

19:05.645 --> 19:07.612
How'd it go?

19:07.614 --> 19:09.647
Well, they hired joe the shark
as their lawyer.

19:09.649 --> 19:11.249
That should
give you some idea.

19:11.251 --> 19:12.683
So they're gonna walk?

19:12.685 --> 19:14.285
For now.

19:14.287 --> 19:16.621
We need to get carter
and lindsay on record,

19:16.623 --> 19:19.657
Or we don't have a case.

19:19.659 --> 19:21.726
Can i help you
with something, bunny?

19:21.728 --> 19:23.761
Ah, i just dropped by
to see erin.

19:23.763 --> 19:25.696
- She's not here.
- Oh.

19:25.698 --> 19:30.401
Okay, well,
i wanna leave here something.

19:30.403 --> 19:32.436
I had this framed
for her.

19:32.438 --> 19:35.706
They look
like sisters, don't they?

19:41.447 --> 19:43.247
You're sick?

19:43.249 --> 19:45.183
I'm sick?

19:45.185 --> 19:46.684
Okay, hank.
Tell me--tell me

19:46.686 --> 19:48.753
What i did wrong this time.

19:48.755 --> 19:51.255
Erin is grieving.

19:51.257 --> 19:53.791
She's in a vulnerable space.

19:53.793 --> 19:55.826
But that's exactly
where you want her, isn't it?

19:55.828 --> 20:00.431
Easier for you
to get your hooks into her?

20:00.433 --> 20:02.400
Listen to me--

20:02.402 --> 20:05.870
Don't ever come back here.

20:05.872 --> 20:07.572
Come on.
I'll show you out.

20:13.680 --> 20:16.747
You know who's sick?
You are sick.

20:16.749 --> 20:17.815
- Yeah?
- They are best friends,

20:17.817 --> 20:19.750
And you're
making this about me?

20:19.752 --> 20:22.253
Get her outta here.
- Come on.

20:22.255 --> 20:24.322
[telephone rings]

20:26.392 --> 20:28.392
One sec.
Hey, boss?

20:28.394 --> 20:29.760
Yeah?

20:29.762 --> 20:32.863
Commander perry's
on the line.

20:37.837 --> 20:39.437
Commander?

20:39.439 --> 20:43.608
Hank--
look, i'm with carter. Uh--

20:43.610 --> 20:45.443
After what went down today,
he'd having second thoughts

20:45.445 --> 20:47.912
About going on record.
He wants out completely.

20:47.914 --> 20:49.914
Listen...

20:49.916 --> 20:52.316
Without his testimony
these guys go free.

20:52.318 --> 20:54.552
Look, man,
they're free already.

20:54.554 --> 20:56.520
(hank)
look, i'll talk to him.
Where are you?

20:56.522 --> 20:59.624
On wacker.
What about miller's pub?

20:59.626 --> 21:01.292
(hank)
i'll be there at 10:00.

21:03.930 --> 21:06.497
Perry?

21:09.769 --> 21:12.870
Perry!
[gunshots over phone]

21:15.942 --> 21:18.409
All right,
let's back it up, people.

21:18.411 --> 21:21.379
Let's back it up.
Right there behind the yellow.

21:24.917 --> 21:27.885
Oh, man.

21:30.790 --> 21:32.390
This is a tough one.

21:32.392 --> 21:34.792
There were two shooters,
approached on foot.

21:34.794 --> 21:36.794
Spoke to several witnesses
who said they were

21:36.796 --> 21:38.596
They were wearin' red and black.

21:38.598 --> 21:40.965
Hoodies pulled up, so nobody got
a good look at their faces.

21:40.967 --> 21:43.534
Red and black.
Vice lord colors.

21:43.536 --> 21:45.303
- Carter?
- He's over there.

21:45.305 --> 21:47.405
I haven't spoken
to him yet.

21:49.409 --> 21:51.409
Hey, how is he?

21:51.411 --> 21:52.843
Well, we gotta take him
to chicago med for surgery,

21:52.845 --> 21:55.313
But i'd say he's
pretty damn lucky.

21:55.315 --> 21:56.580
- Give me a minute.
- No, no, no. Hey, hey.

21:56.582 --> 21:59.050
Sir, no, we gotta
get him outta here.

21:59.052 --> 22:00.718
I tried
to get a shot off.

22:00.720 --> 22:03.754
- It happened so fast.
- Just listen to me.

22:03.756 --> 22:06.791
The shooters--
were they vice lords?

22:06.793 --> 22:09.527
No, no.
One of 'em i recognized.

22:09.529 --> 22:12.596
They call him "drug store".
He rolls with the latin kings.

22:12.598 --> 22:16.834
The colors they were flashin'--
it was just camouflage.

22:16.836 --> 22:19.804
Why would he come after you?

22:19.806 --> 22:22.406
I don't know.

22:27.680 --> 22:33.050
You got something to tell me,
you better tell me right now.

22:33.052 --> 22:35.786
Westlake terrace.

22:35.788 --> 22:38.856
It's the latin kings stash house
out in jackson park.

22:38.858 --> 22:41.459
The one time i set it up,

22:41.461 --> 22:45.129
Drug store and his boys
were dealin' out of it.

22:45.131 --> 22:46.797
A couple weeks ago, we hit it.

22:46.799 --> 22:49.066
Roland and them,
they grabbed a few kilos.

22:49.068 --> 22:54.672
It's the only time
i took money.

22:54.674 --> 22:59.410
You used your uncle
to cover your own ass.

22:59.412 --> 23:03.814
Now, he's dead--
because he want to bat for you.

23:03.816 --> 23:09.453
You of all people
have to understand, right?

23:13.893 --> 23:15.760
Wrong.

23:27.774 --> 23:29.974
We get a location
on the shooter yet?

23:29.976 --> 23:32.743
Still workin' on it.

23:32.745 --> 23:35.546
Everything okay?

23:35.548 --> 23:37.815
I came as soon as i
got your message.

23:37.817 --> 23:41.752
Which one?
I left three.

23:44.891 --> 23:46.857
Erin?

23:46.859 --> 23:48.959
Erin.

23:51.464 --> 23:54.598
I'm not your boss.

23:54.600 --> 23:57.701
I don't care where you were.

23:57.703 --> 24:03.541
But know that i am
looking out for you.

24:03.543 --> 24:07.511
Whatever you got
goin' on upstairs...

24:07.513 --> 24:10.147
You gotta face it head-on.

24:12.084 --> 24:13.884
[exhales]

24:13.886 --> 24:16.086
Thanks.

24:20.092 --> 24:21.659
I just got off the phone

24:21.661 --> 24:24.728
With commander perry's
wife, jeanette.

24:24.730 --> 24:26.864
[sighs]
man retires after 30 years,

24:26.866 --> 24:29.967
And a few months later,
he's gunned down in the street.

24:29.969 --> 24:32.603
Anyway...

24:32.604 --> 24:35.238
I'll get you all details
on the services when i get 'em.

24:35.241 --> 24:37.875
- Thanks, trudy.
- Yeah.

24:39.779 --> 24:42.046
My office.

24:48.988 --> 24:50.688
I still can't believe
this is about perry.

24:50.690 --> 24:53.557
I got a call from iad.

24:53.559 --> 24:55.593
Detective karen o'toole says

24:55.595 --> 24:58.028
You never took the drug test.

24:58.030 --> 25:02.566
It's not optional, erin.

25:02.568 --> 25:08.506
I take that test,
i'm gonna fail.

25:08.508 --> 25:10.841
I had a few drinks
the other night and this guy--

25:10.843 --> 25:15.713
I asked if i could
depend on you, you said yes.

25:15.715 --> 25:17.014
We got perry's killers
out there somewhere,

25:17.016 --> 25:18.582
And i gotta worry about you.

25:18.584 --> 25:21.252
- Hank, just hear me out.
- Every cop i know...

25:21.254 --> 25:24.121
Eventually goes
through a bad patch.

25:24.123 --> 25:26.290
Some recover
and get through it.

25:26.292 --> 25:29.093
The ones who don't...

25:29.095 --> 25:32.930
They walk around wondering
what happened to their careers.

25:32.932 --> 25:35.766
You're at the point
where you gotta figure it out.

25:39.272 --> 25:40.838
It was before perry
came in, all right?

25:40.840 --> 25:43.741
All i did was party
a little too hard.

25:43.743 --> 25:45.676
So you're back
to your old habits.

25:45.678 --> 25:47.111
No--

25:47.113 --> 25:50.981
The guy i was with had
some pharmaceuticals, and...

25:50.983 --> 25:54.118
The nights fuzzy, so,
i'm thinkin' maybe,

25:54.120 --> 25:55.837
At some point,
i went to the bathroom,

25:55.838 --> 25:57.555
And he slipped something
in my drink, but i don't know.

25:57.557 --> 25:58.956
I had a lot to drink, and--

25:58.958 --> 26:01.859
You know who you sound like,
right now?

26:01.861 --> 26:05.896
Your mother.

26:05.898 --> 26:08.098
Look, i'll reach out
to a doc i know,

26:08.100 --> 26:11.035
He'll--
he'll say you've been

26:11.037 --> 26:13.771
Dealin' with depression
and back date a prescription

26:13.773 --> 26:16.640
For whatever pills you took.

26:16.642 --> 26:19.176
But i can't get into it now.

26:19.178 --> 26:22.713
Until this is solved,
you're off the clock.

26:29.288 --> 26:30.955
Reached out to a ci of mine.

26:30.957 --> 26:33.357
Got a location on this
latin king nicknamed drugstore.

26:33.359 --> 26:35.225
All right.
Round everyone up.

26:35.227 --> 26:36.860
He's not at his spot
in jackson park.

26:36.862 --> 26:38.262
He's in the city.

26:38.264 --> 26:39.997
Turns out he's
hold up in the cave.

26:39.999 --> 26:41.599
That club
over on the westside?

26:41.601 --> 26:43.133
Yeah, it's being protected
by his uncle.

26:43.135 --> 26:44.868
High up
in the chicago kings.

26:44.870 --> 26:47.171
This won't be our typical
snatch and grab.

26:47.173 --> 26:50.174
All right.

26:50.176 --> 26:53.310
[overlapping chatter]

26:53.312 --> 26:56.113
(male)
we've got two guys on the roof.

26:56.115 --> 26:58.349
I see 'em.
Get ready.

27:07.860 --> 27:10.027
[glass shatters]

27:11.831 --> 27:13.931
- Hey!
- Let's get out of here!

27:20.272 --> 27:21.905
In the parking lot!

27:21.907 --> 27:24.975
[woman screams]

27:24.977 --> 27:27.277
Whoa!
Call the fire department.

27:27.279 --> 27:30.280
[dance music playing]

27:30.282 --> 27:35.052
¶ ¶

27:35.054 --> 27:38.355
- Everybody clear out of here.
- Cpd! Get out! Move, now!

27:38.357 --> 27:39.823
Get out!
Get out!

27:39.825 --> 27:41.792
You two, come on.
Come on, let's go.

27:41.794 --> 27:43.477
Gun! Get down!

27:43.478 --> 27:45.161
- Come on, move it!
- Hey, hey, hey!

27:45.164 --> 27:46.363
Where do you think
you're going?

27:46.365 --> 27:48.132
Get out.

27:48.134 --> 27:49.867
- [coughing]
- on your stomach.

27:49.869 --> 27:52.302
- Turn around, get down!
- Hands behind your back.

27:52.304 --> 27:54.738
You killed a friend of mine.

27:54.740 --> 27:57.908
I wanna know why.
I wanna know why!

27:57.910 --> 28:01.011
Think you're gonna
make it outta here, hey?

28:01.013 --> 28:04.114
Give me the torch.

28:04.116 --> 28:06.383
You think a little burn
gonna make me talk?

28:06.385 --> 28:09.853
You know what, bitch?
You don't have to talk...

28:09.855 --> 28:13.757
'cause your boyfriend's
gonna do it for ya.

28:13.759 --> 28:15.292
Come here.

28:17.963 --> 28:19.797
You go after carter
because he robbed you,

28:19.799 --> 28:23.367
Or 'cause roland
gave you orders.

28:26.038 --> 28:28.172
You think i'm playin'?

28:28.174 --> 28:30.974
[growling]

28:30.976 --> 28:33.143
Yeah.
[screaming]

28:33.145 --> 28:35.212
Okay, it was roland!

28:35.214 --> 28:36.880
He made us a deal!

28:36.882 --> 28:39.116
What kinda deal?

28:39.118 --> 28:40.918
Roland said he'd put
a drug case on us.

28:40.920 --> 28:43.220
Bury us in statesville
for 20 years.

28:43.222 --> 28:46.857
All we had to do was take out
that snitch, carter.

28:46.859 --> 28:51.061
He said they'd take care
of the other bitch themselves.

28:51.063 --> 28:55.032
What bitch?
What bitch?

28:55.034 --> 28:58.235
Some lady cop
he said set 'em up.

28:59.271 --> 29:02.172
All right, get down.

29:02.174 --> 29:04.274
[cell phone dialing]

29:11.317 --> 29:13.417
Yo, erin.

29:13.419 --> 29:17.488
Hey, landon.

29:17.490 --> 29:19.289
Look, thanks
for the fun time

29:19.291 --> 29:20.991
The other night, but...

29:20.993 --> 29:23.026
Do you see me
on one knee?

29:23.028 --> 29:25.929
I just thought
we could do some shots.

29:25.931 --> 29:27.931
It has not
been a good day.

29:27.933 --> 29:31.401
One beer. Come on,
you can tell me all about it.

29:35.307 --> 29:38.475
All right.

29:39.879 --> 29:41.178
I gotta say--
a woman with a gun

29:41.180 --> 29:42.980
Really turns me on.

29:42.982 --> 29:46.316
Uhhh...Yeah.

29:46.318 --> 29:48.285
Still got that ticket
to rocklahoma for ya.

29:48.287 --> 29:50.020
[erin grunts]
you should come.

29:50.022 --> 29:52.089
Yeah, maybe next year.

29:54.260 --> 29:55.959
Unh!

29:55.961 --> 29:57.995
Okay.

29:57.997 --> 30:00.230
You should have never
set foot in jackson park.

30:04.570 --> 30:07.437
- Atwater.
You anywhere near erin's?

30:07.439 --> 30:08.939
Yeah, we're
on 14th and wabash,

30:08.941 --> 30:10.440
Like five minutes away.

30:10.442 --> 30:12.810
Get over there, right now.

30:12.812 --> 30:14.511
You see any
of those jackson park cops

30:14.513 --> 30:16.446
Anywhere near there,
you take them out.

30:16.448 --> 30:22.186
Get up!
Get over there.

30:22.188 --> 30:23.554
You really think you're
gonna kill a chicago cop

30:23.556 --> 30:24.555
And get away with it?

30:24.557 --> 30:26.123
Keep your mouth shut.

30:29.295 --> 30:32.830
There's an unmarked squad--
it's not ours.

30:35.434 --> 30:38.168
This'll look
like a bad domestic.

30:38.170 --> 30:39.570
Drink it.

30:39.572 --> 30:41.271
- Aw, come on, man.
- Drink it!

30:51.016 --> 30:52.583
[cocks gun]
chicago pd!

30:52.585 --> 30:54.163
Let me see your hands.

30:54.164 --> 30:55.742
Hey, we're all
on the same team here, officer.

30:55.743 --> 30:57.321
If i don't see your hands,
this is gonna get messy.

30:57.323 --> 31:00.190
Roland didn't say nothin'
about droppin' two bodies.

31:00.192 --> 31:01.458
Don't be a punk, all right?

31:01.460 --> 31:03.026
Let's do this think
and get outta here.

31:03.028 --> 31:05.295
Yo, sarge.
Yeah, we got a problem--

31:05.297 --> 31:07.231
- She's not alone
- cpd!

31:07.233 --> 31:09.199

[gunshot]

31:09.201 --> 31:11.101
[groaning]

31:14.139 --> 31:16.373
You move, you die.
You hear me?

31:16.375 --> 31:18.542
Hmm? Do you understand me?

31:18.544 --> 31:21.979
You straight, erin?

31:21.981 --> 31:24.948
Thanks, kev.

31:26.085 --> 31:27.551
[tires screeching]

31:30.022 --> 31:32.389
Get on your knees!
Hands behind your back!

31:35.227 --> 31:38.195
Atwater's inside.

31:38.330 --> 31:39.596
It's okay.

31:39.598 --> 31:42.032
- Erin!
- We're okay!

31:42.034 --> 31:45.035
Hold this, hold this.
Here.

31:49.608 --> 31:53.310
You had us worried there
for a sec.

31:53.312 --> 31:55.112
Where's roland?

31:55.114 --> 31:59.349
You call me an ambulance yet?

31:59.351 --> 32:01.985
- I said...
- [screams]

32:01.987 --> 32:03.921
Where's roland?

32:16.535 --> 32:18.201
[gun cocking]

32:35.654 --> 32:40.023
I sent my girl
out with a friend.

32:40.025 --> 32:42.592
They like to play
the slots at the river boat.

32:42.594 --> 32:45.529
So, it's just you and me.

32:45.531 --> 32:47.230
Hmm.

32:50.469 --> 32:52.970
Looks like you
had a pretty good run.

32:52.972 --> 32:55.605
Over a million.

32:55.607 --> 32:58.041
I was gonna wack it up
with my guys, but it looks like

32:58.043 --> 33:00.577
They won't
be needin' it anymore.

33:00.579 --> 33:03.213
So how about it, voight?

33:03.215 --> 33:06.149
50/50.

33:06.151 --> 33:07.250
Let me walk,

33:07.252 --> 33:10.287
And half a million dollars
is yours.

33:10.289 --> 33:13.557
You call a hit on two cops.

33:13.559 --> 33:17.761
You come after one of my own.

33:17.763 --> 33:22.065
You really think you can
buy your way outta that?

33:22.067 --> 33:26.169
I'm just takin' a page
from the hank voight playbook.

33:26.171 --> 33:28.238
You have no idea who i am.

33:28.240 --> 33:30.073
Sure i do.

33:30.075 --> 33:32.709
Back when i was a rookie,
i heard all about how you were

33:32.711 --> 33:35.412
The only cop who had the balls
to make sonny gags and his crew

33:35.414 --> 33:37.647
Pay street tax.

33:37.649 --> 33:40.083
Everyone knew,
you don't pay up to voight,

33:40.085 --> 33:43.220
You end up in the river.

33:43.222 --> 33:46.023
You were a legend.

33:47.426 --> 33:50.594
If i was the cop you think
i am, you'd already be dead.

33:50.596 --> 33:53.730
There'd be no million
on the table.

33:53.732 --> 33:55.532
Come on.

33:58.370 --> 34:00.804
You and me are
the only ones in this room.

34:04.343 --> 34:06.510
Take the money.

34:19.058 --> 34:22.059
You're gonna dial 911

34:22.061 --> 34:25.228
And you're gonna
turn yourself in.

34:25.230 --> 34:28.632
I'm gonna watch
you surrender your badge.

34:28.634 --> 34:31.134
You really think
this is gonna redeem you?

34:35.174 --> 34:38.275
I'm givin' you a chance.

34:44.248 --> 34:46.183
You move your hand any lower,

34:46.185 --> 34:48.717
You're gonna be breathin'
outta your forehead.

35:00.365 --> 35:02.399
Make the call.

35:24.389 --> 35:26.289
Watch your head.

35:44.843 --> 35:46.676
Atwater.

35:49.381 --> 35:50.914
That was a hell
of a save last night.

35:50.916 --> 35:53.283
You and roman both.

35:53.285 --> 35:55.452
That means a lot.
It really does, sarge.

35:55.454 --> 35:56.820
I'll let sean know.

35:56.822 --> 35:58.321
I'll tell him myself
when i see him.

35:58.323 --> 35:59.823
Right now,
i need you change

35:59.825 --> 36:04.294
Outta that uniform.
Get your ass back upstairs.

36:04.296 --> 36:06.229
Damn, thanks.

36:06.231 --> 36:07.764
I mean, sarge,
what i did last night.

36:10.536 --> 36:14.204
I woulda done regardless.
It was lindsay.

36:14.206 --> 36:16.573
I know.

36:18.777 --> 36:22.512
Oh, i'm not piling on.
You're a hero, et cetera.

36:22.514 --> 36:23.847
Change out
like the sergeant said

36:23.849 --> 36:26.216
And let's get back
to work, all right?

36:26.218 --> 36:28.251
Copy that.

36:35.527 --> 36:37.394
Hey.

36:37.396 --> 36:39.496
Don't think she came in.

36:39.498 --> 36:41.831
So, how are things
with matadors.

36:41.833 --> 36:43.466
Ah. Between me,
halstead, and roman,

36:43.468 --> 36:45.335
We only have half
of what we need.

36:45.337 --> 36:47.437
Um, i put in a call
to the credit union--

36:47.439 --> 36:49.873
See about taking some money
out of my 401k.

36:59.384 --> 37:03.220
Courtesy of jackson park.

37:03.222 --> 37:04.955
Hey. Police youth league...

37:04.957 --> 37:09.559
Saved a lot of kids.

37:09.561 --> 37:12.662
Keep it goin'.

37:23.976 --> 37:26.743
Hey. Congratulations, kev.
Voight just told me.

37:26.745 --> 37:30.247
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

37:30.249 --> 37:31.881
You cool?

37:31.883 --> 37:33.383
Look, i don't wanna
lie to you , man.

37:33.385 --> 37:35.418
You know this is
where i wanna be.

37:35.420 --> 37:36.920
It's too bad
you're not good police.

37:36.922 --> 37:40.323
- You'll never get another shot.
- Oh, shut up.

37:40.325 --> 37:41.625
- You'll be back upstairs.
- [laughs] all right.

37:41.627 --> 37:43.760
- Come here.
- Thanks, man.

37:43.762 --> 37:45.328
Yeah.

37:45.330 --> 37:46.963
He's baaack!

37:46.965 --> 37:48.999

- Yes, buddy.

37:49.001 --> 37:51.735
- Good to have you back.
- Thank you.

37:56.908 --> 37:58.908
- Hey.
- Hi.

37:58.910 --> 38:02.012
Well, you should be happy.
I'm back on patrol.

38:11.290 --> 38:13.290
I wanted to keep this informal,
so i thought, you know--

38:13.292 --> 38:16.493
What's more informal
than the locker room...

38:18.930 --> 38:21.064
Right?

38:21.066 --> 38:22.766
Okay. Yeah.

38:25.070 --> 38:26.936
So, listen, i know
i've been a little weird lately.

38:26.938 --> 38:29.072
It's got nothin' to do
with you and i workin' together.

38:29.074 --> 38:31.408
I just, uhhh...
Been tryin' to figure out

38:31.410 --> 38:33.610
Out how to tell you that
i want to spend the rest

38:33.612 --> 38:36.012
Of my life with you,
and, uh...

38:36.014 --> 38:37.447
You and i are freakin'
awesome together.

38:37.449 --> 38:38.548
I know this is quick,

38:38.550 --> 38:39.582
But i don't care
because i love you--

38:39.584 --> 38:41.618
Yes.

38:44.389 --> 38:45.889
Yeah?

38:52.531 --> 38:55.932
[cell phone rings]

38:55.934 --> 38:57.901
(female)

38:57.903 --> 39:00.337
Yeah, who's this?

39:00.339 --> 39:01.905
My name's michelle.

39:01.907 --> 39:04.674
- My mom said you could help.
- Your mom?

39:04.676 --> 39:07.344
Linda sovana.

39:07.346 --> 39:08.812
I didn't know
linda had a daughter.

39:08.814 --> 39:11.981
Yeah, well,
she gave me your number, so...

39:11.983 --> 39:14.984
Look, i don't know
what linda told you

39:14.986 --> 39:16.853
Or how she thinks
i can help.

39:16.855 --> 39:19.489
Because...

39:19.491 --> 39:22.025
I guess you're my dad.

39:39.444 --> 39:41.644
Little early, isn't it?

39:44.816 --> 39:47.884
I had a rough night.

39:47.886 --> 39:49.519
Yeah, i think we all did.

39:52.758 --> 39:55.125
Let's grab a coffee
on the way back to the district.

39:55.127 --> 39:57.160
Uh, hank, actually,
i've been thinking.

40:00.399 --> 40:01.965
I'm nothin' but bad news,
you know?

40:05.070 --> 40:07.070
I was born into bad news
and i can't seem

40:07.072 --> 40:10.407
To get away from it.

40:10.409 --> 40:13.476
But it's the ones
around me, the...

40:15.180 --> 40:17.547
The people that
i care about the most

40:17.549 --> 40:19.182
Who end up getting hurt.

40:19.184 --> 40:20.984
So, um...

40:24.423 --> 40:26.623
You gotta stop being
so hard on yourself.

40:28.960 --> 40:31.194
I had a talk with my mom.

40:33.732 --> 40:35.965
Where'd that get you?

40:35.967 --> 40:38.968
Well, we decided
that it might be a good thing

40:38.970 --> 40:42.772
For you to give erin
some space, you know?

40:42.774 --> 40:46.576
So she can figure things out
for herself.

40:54.619 --> 40:56.486
Let's go.

41:01.693 --> 41:04.928
I've talked to you
as a friend, as a father.

41:07.098 --> 41:09.999
Now i'm talkin'
to you as your boss.

41:12.604 --> 41:14.838
Get off the stool.
Let's go to work.

41:19.044 --> 41:20.910
Actually, i quit.

41:26.718 --> 41:28.585
We're good, hank.

41:28.587 --> 41:31.888
Any issues
that erin is dealing with,

41:31.890 --> 41:34.224
It's a family matter.

41:34.226 --> 41:35.959
