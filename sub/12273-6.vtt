WEBVTT

00:02.570 --> 00:04.572
(sirens wailing)

00:06.307 --> 00:08.309
(panting)

00:10.378 --> 00:12.180
MAN:
Yo, watch out!

00:13.547 --> 00:14.582
FLACK:
Hey! Hey!

00:19.487 --> 00:21.355
GIRL:
Wait. Are you kidding me?

00:21.389 --> 00:23.824
I thought you said this story
was about a princess,

00:23.857 --> 00:25.393
not some cops
chasing some dude.

00:25.426 --> 00:27.328
It is.
I'm just setting it up.

00:27.361 --> 00:28.762
Okay? See?

00:28.796 --> 00:30.231
It's called backstory.

00:30.264 --> 00:32.333
Well, how about getting
to the front story?

00:33.134 --> 00:34.735
Well, I...

00:34.768 --> 00:37.838
Detective Flack
is chasing the bad guy.

00:37.871 --> 00:39.607
(grunting)

00:44.612 --> 00:45.746
Where is it, Rennick?
Where's what?

00:45.779 --> 00:47.781
The gun you used to kill
Roger Murray with.

00:47.815 --> 00:48.816
Who?
Hey.

00:48.849 --> 00:51.085
I pulled a hamstring
scaling that truck over there.

00:51.119 --> 00:52.386
You don't want to
mess with me right now.

00:52.420 --> 00:53.821
Hey, man, come on!
Listen to me.

00:53.854 --> 00:56.124
We got your blood,
we got your prints.

00:56.157 --> 00:57.125
You're going away.

00:57.158 --> 00:59.527
The only question
is for how long?

01:00.561 --> 01:02.430
It's in the pond.

01:02.463 --> 01:04.132
Turtle Pond.

01:06.234 --> 01:07.601
Near the dock.

01:07.635 --> 01:09.470
Let's go.

01:09.503 --> 01:10.838
OFFICER:
Let's go.

01:10.871 --> 01:12.840
RENNICK:
I swear, I threw it in there.

01:12.873 --> 01:15.143
(indistinct radio transmission)

01:17.178 --> 01:19.613
Between the mud
and the zero visibility,

01:19.647 --> 01:20.781
I got nothing.

01:20.814 --> 01:22.683
Might need more divers;
it's a big pond.

01:22.716 --> 01:24.618
Rennick's not getting
away with murder.

01:24.652 --> 01:25.819
Drain it.

01:26.854 --> 01:29.190
Drain it?

01:31.925 --> 01:33.894
GIRL:
Ugh. Drain the pond?

01:33.927 --> 01:35.729
How long is this gonna take?

01:35.763 --> 01:38.366
Uh, well, not nearly
as long as a lineup takes.

01:38.399 --> 01:40.901
Your mom's gonna be...
at least another hour,

01:40.934 --> 01:43.704
and I don't see anybody
rushing over here

01:43.737 --> 01:46.307
to take my report, so
I think we're stuck.
GIRL 2:
If you're a cop,

01:46.340 --> 01:48.909
why can't you report
your stolen car to yourself?

01:48.942 --> 01:50.911
Um, well, 'cause
I'm not a cop.

01:50.944 --> 01:52.680
No, I mean, I work with cops.

01:52.713 --> 01:54.715
Yeah, I do cop stuff,

01:54.748 --> 01:58.186
but I'm a... I'm a
crime scene investigator.

01:59.953 --> 02:02.156
(video game bleeping)

02:04.192 --> 02:05.025
Okay, fine.

02:05.058 --> 02:06.494
Girls, I'll tell you
about the princess.

02:06.527 --> 02:09.197
So we're all in
the Turtle Pond--

02:09.229 --> 02:10.497
you know, in Central Park--

02:10.531 --> 02:13.534
looking for the bad guy's gun.

02:13.567 --> 02:15.536
TAYLOR:
Everybody spread out.

02:15.569 --> 02:17.571
(indistinct radio transmissions)

02:31.785 --> 02:33.321
(beeping)

02:39.493 --> 02:41.595
No way.

02:41.629 --> 02:43.697
I found it.

02:43.731 --> 02:45.733
I found it!

03:01.949 --> 03:03.951
DANVILLE:
Mac?

03:03.984 --> 03:05.953
Another gun?

03:05.986 --> 03:07.421
Another murder.

03:13.294 --> 03:17.298
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH
access.wgbh.org

03:33.647 --> 03:38.018
* Out here in the fields

03:38.051 --> 03:41.922
* I fight for my meals

03:41.955 --> 03:46.527
* I get my back into my living

03:48.929 --> 03:51.231
* Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:01.842 --> 04:04.044
TAYLOR:
Yeah.

04:04.077 --> 04:06.680
Okay. I got it.
Keep me posted.

04:08.716 --> 04:11.018
She's been underwater
for at least a couple of days,

04:11.051 --> 04:13.954
so any evidence of foul play
would definitely be compromised.

04:13.987 --> 04:18.426
No purse, no ID, no cell phone.

04:18.459 --> 04:19.993
So far she doesn't
match a description

04:20.027 --> 04:22.396
on any recent
Missing Persons reports.

04:26.434 --> 04:27.668
Blunt force trauma.

04:27.701 --> 04:29.370
Enough to kill her.

04:30.037 --> 04:31.705
Drain plug's missing.

04:31.739 --> 04:32.973
She's tied down.

04:33.006 --> 04:34.675
Well-thought-out suicide?

04:34.708 --> 04:36.009
Mugging gone wrong?

04:36.043 --> 04:38.779
Well, they didn't
take her earrings.

04:38.812 --> 04:40.681
Quite an elaborate way
for a grab-and-go guy

04:40.714 --> 04:41.849
to dispose of a body.

04:41.882 --> 04:43.083
Eliminates mugging.

04:43.116 --> 04:45.619
Quite a ball gown, so...

04:45.653 --> 04:47.521
I'm not buying suicide.

04:47.555 --> 04:50.391
That leaves good,
old-fashioned murder.

04:50.424 --> 04:53.361
So we've got a castle,

04:53.394 --> 04:55.028
and a princess.

04:55.062 --> 04:57.431
And an unhappy ending.

04:57.465 --> 04:59.467
(indistinct talking)

05:18.151 --> 05:20.388
GIRL: Is that what
she was killed with?

05:20.421 --> 05:22.823
No, um...

05:22.856 --> 05:26.360
that actually was
a piece of a spaceship.

05:30.130 --> 05:32.966
Let's go.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.503
*

05:53.721 --> 05:55.689
* I'm a sinner

05:55.723 --> 05:57.858
* I'm a liar

05:57.891 --> 06:00.127
* Want forgiveness

06:00.160 --> 06:02.430
* But I'm tired

06:02.463 --> 06:03.997
* I'm addicted

06:04.031 --> 06:05.999
* To the fire

06:06.033 --> 06:08.001
* Let go, I'm ready for it *

06:08.035 --> 06:10.438
* Let go, I'm ready *

06:10.471 --> 06:12.139
* I'm a victim

06:12.172 --> 06:13.474
* I'm a coward

06:13.507 --> 06:15.576
* Try to wake up

06:15.609 --> 06:18.111
* Don't have the power

06:18.145 --> 06:20.180
* I'm a daughter

06:20.213 --> 06:21.782
* In the choir

06:21.815 --> 06:23.083
* Let go, I'm ready for it *

06:23.116 --> 06:25.085
* Let go, I'm ready *

06:25.118 --> 06:28.956
* Ooh-ooh, ooh *

06:28.989 --> 06:32.593
* Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh *

06:32.626 --> 06:36.497
* Ooh-ooh, ooh  *

06:36.530 --> 06:40.934

06:52.813 --> 06:55.015

06:55.048 --> 06:56.517

06:56.550 --> 06:58.185
* Want forgiveness

06:58.218 --> 07:00.621
* Getting weaker

07:00.654 --> 07:02.623

07:04.257 --> 07:06.093

07:06.126 --> 07:08.529
* Let go, I'm ready *

* Ooh-ooh, ooh *

07:11.999 --> 07:15.869

07:15.903 --> 07:19.740
* No, no, no eyes, baby

07:19.773 --> 07:23.644
* No, no, no mind, baby

07:23.677 --> 07:27.781
* No, no, no smile, baby

07:27.815 --> 07:30.651
* No, no, no lies

07:34.021 --> 07:37.958
* Lay me down tonight

07:37.991 --> 07:43.831
* No lies...

07:47.167 --> 07:48.736
* Blood, I want it

07:48.769 --> 07:50.771
* Giving up the fight

07:50.804 --> 07:52.773
* Blood, I want it

07:52.806 --> 07:54.241
* Lay me down tonight yeah

07:54.274 --> 07:56.176
* Blood, I want it

07:56.209 --> 07:58.812
* Take me to the sky

07:58.846 --> 08:00.213
* Blood, I want it

08:00.247 --> 08:03.083
* Everything's all right now.

08:17.931 --> 08:20.568
Prints got a match
to Ashley Braden, 26.

08:20.601 --> 08:22.903
Had a juvie record for a meth
bust about eight years ago.

08:22.936 --> 08:24.237
Been clean ever since.

08:24.271 --> 08:26.907
Part-time student
at Chelsea U, no next of kin.

08:26.940 --> 08:28.842
No signs of
pulmonary edema.

08:28.876 --> 08:31.078
Means she was dead before
she went in the water.

08:31.111 --> 08:34.582
COD is subdural hematoma,

08:34.615 --> 08:36.950
caused by massive
blunt force trauma.

08:36.984 --> 08:39.787
Analysis of the trace
you recovered from the wound

08:39.820 --> 08:41.254
suggests that the weapon was

08:41.288 --> 08:43.090
a banded metamorphic deposit,

08:43.123 --> 08:46.694
containing quartz, mica,
feldspar and biotite.

08:46.727 --> 08:49.563
She was killed
with a rock.

08:49.597 --> 08:50.631
Specifically,
Manhattan schist.

08:50.664 --> 08:52.265
Which doesn't help us,
'cause the city's full of it.

08:52.299 --> 08:54.234
Time of death?

08:54.267 --> 08:55.969
Well, given
the water temperature,

08:56.003 --> 08:58.038
and extensive skin slippage,

08:58.071 --> 09:01.241
I'd say she'd been underwater
approximately 60 hours

09:01.274 --> 09:02.576
when you found her.

09:02.610 --> 09:03.543
And how long before that
was she killed?

09:03.577 --> 09:08.582
Lividity is exclusively
along her right side.

09:08.616 --> 09:10.851
TAYLOR: Consistent with her
position in the boat.

09:10.884 --> 09:13.120
So she was probably
pushed out into the water

09:13.153 --> 09:14.321
within minutes of her death.

09:14.354 --> 09:15.322
TAYLOR:
Which would suggest

09:15.355 --> 09:16.924
she was killed in the park,

09:16.957 --> 09:18.258
quite close to the pond.

09:18.291 --> 09:19.627
HAWKES:
60 hours...

09:19.660 --> 09:21.595
puts it at Saturday night,
around midnight.

09:21.629 --> 09:25.833
Stomach contents revealed
traces of Arothron hispidus,

09:25.866 --> 09:27.134
also known as puffer fish.

09:27.167 --> 09:28.335
Very expensive sushi.

09:28.368 --> 09:30.137
And delicious.

09:30.170 --> 09:32.239
Her last meal was to die for.

09:33.273 --> 09:35.242
HAWKES:
Fancy meal, fancy dress,

09:35.275 --> 09:36.644
fancy party...

09:36.677 --> 09:37.978
That begs the question,
where was Ashley

09:38.011 --> 09:39.312
before she was at the park?

09:39.346 --> 09:41.381
SID:
And who was she with?

09:41.414 --> 09:42.850
I may have discovered
evidence of a struggle.

09:45.085 --> 09:46.687
I took subdermal photos.

09:48.388 --> 09:50.257
TAYLOR:
Very light discoloration.

09:50.290 --> 09:53.226
Yeah, but then
I found...

09:53.260 --> 09:55.262
burst capillaries.

09:57.330 --> 09:59.933
And in a circular pattern,

09:59.967 --> 10:01.268
around her wrist.

10:04.371 --> 10:05.673
Somebody grabbed her.

10:05.706 --> 10:06.874
And she resisted.

10:06.907 --> 10:10.744
Ashley didn't go down
without a fight.

10:39.339 --> 10:41.341
*

11:12.405 --> 11:14.307
CHRISTINE:
I just want you
to look me in the eye

11:14.341 --> 11:16.209
and tell me nothing's wrong.

11:16.243 --> 11:19.446
PHILLIPS:
You're suffering from
what's called anomic aphasia.

11:19.479 --> 11:21.181
I can appreciate your optimism,

11:21.214 --> 11:23.216
but you cannot do this alone.

11:27.420 --> 11:29.322
(line ringing)

11:29.356 --> 11:30.758
(beeps)

11:30.791 --> 11:32.793
Christine, uh,
when you get this,

11:32.826 --> 11:35.195
can you call me?

11:35.228 --> 11:37.230
I don't want to leave things...

11:38.832 --> 11:41.001
Just call me, please.

11:52.145 --> 11:54.114
TAYLOR:
You got a match on the gun

11:54.147 --> 11:56.083
from the pond?
100%.

11:56.116 --> 11:58.118
Sent the ballistics
report to the D.A.,

11:58.151 --> 11:59.920
and Rennick's probably
pled out by now.

11:59.953 --> 12:01.488
What's that?

12:01.521 --> 12:03.190
That is an excellent
question, Mac.

12:03.223 --> 12:04.357
I found this in the pond.

12:04.391 --> 12:05.826
Strange etchings,

12:05.859 --> 12:07.194
carbon trace from intense heat,

12:07.227 --> 12:08.428
and radioactivity.

12:08.461 --> 12:10.964
Not enough to be dangerous,
just intriguing.

12:10.998 --> 12:14.467
But here is the
pièce de résistance:

12:14.501 --> 12:16.169
I found particles combined of

12:16.203 --> 12:18.538
nickel, iron and olivine.

12:18.571 --> 12:20.140
Space dust.

12:20.173 --> 12:21.975
That's right, M.T. Okay?

12:22.009 --> 12:23.510
This is not of this earth.

12:23.543 --> 12:25.012
GIRL 2:
Nuh-uh.

12:25.045 --> 12:26.914
Uh-huh.
Nuh-uh!

12:26.947 --> 12:28.515
Uh-huh!
GIRL:
So...

12:28.548 --> 12:29.983
what'd the boss cop say?

12:30.017 --> 12:31.785
Well, he said, um...

12:31.819 --> 12:33.086
Fascinating.

12:33.120 --> 12:36.456
Now clear the rest of the guns,

12:36.489 --> 12:38.926
and don't ever
call me "M.T." again.

12:38.959 --> 12:41.428
All right.

12:44.464 --> 12:46.066
Give me some good news.

12:46.099 --> 12:49.236
My 14-year-old daughter
broke up with her boyfriend.

12:49.269 --> 12:51.438
(chuckles)
And I found

12:51.471 --> 12:53.874
a trace of flora
wedged behind a rhinestone

12:53.907 --> 12:55.275
on the back
of our vic's shoe,

12:55.308 --> 12:57.544
which suggests that she was
dragged along the ground.

12:57.577 --> 13:00.814
If EDNA can give us a match
to a plant in the park,

13:00.848 --> 13:02.482
it could give us the
primary crime scene.

13:02.515 --> 13:03.851
More good news.

13:03.884 --> 13:04.952
I found a bloodstain
on our victim's dress.

13:04.985 --> 13:05.953
Not her own.

13:05.986 --> 13:07.587
After three days in water?

13:07.620 --> 13:09.122
It was under her arm.

13:09.156 --> 13:12.325
GCMS analysis found
aluminum sulfate.

13:12.359 --> 13:14.094
A dye-fixing agent.

13:14.127 --> 13:15.495
It's also an ingredient
in antiperspirant,

13:15.528 --> 13:17.330
which is why it
preserved the bloodstain.

13:17.364 --> 13:19.099
It is human, so I'm running
it through CODIS right now

13:19.132 --> 13:20.968
to see if we can get a hit.

13:21.001 --> 13:23.937
There's also something unusual
about the labels on her clothes.

13:23.971 --> 13:26.606
Bargain basement brand, right?

13:26.639 --> 13:29.076
Her dress... a designer label,

13:29.109 --> 13:30.277
very expensive.

13:30.310 --> 13:31.578
She's a part-time student.

13:31.611 --> 13:33.113
How'd she afford
a dress like that?

13:33.146 --> 13:34.481
She didn't.

13:35.515 --> 13:37.317
The tag's still on.

13:37.350 --> 13:38.618
Clearly, she was
going to return it.

13:38.651 --> 13:41.488
A poor girl
trying to look rich.

13:41.521 --> 13:43.356
Cinderella story.

13:46.659 --> 13:49.897
Hey, Jo?
Yeah.

13:49.930 --> 13:53.200
Last week, I was
a bit short with you.

13:53.233 --> 13:55.168
You made your point.

13:56.904 --> 13:58.538
Already forgotten.

13:58.571 --> 14:00.207
(computer beeps)

14:01.341 --> 14:02.642
DANVILLE:
Ah.

14:02.675 --> 14:05.112
The face behind
the blood trace.

14:05.145 --> 14:07.847
TAYLOR:
Joseph Skiver.

14:14.587 --> 14:16.656
Steady.
(grunting)

14:16.689 --> 14:18.959
Check the interiors.

14:18.992 --> 14:20.961
Nah, I got it.

14:22.029 --> 14:23.964
(talking indistinctly)

14:26.967 --> 14:27.935
Yo!

14:28.969 --> 14:30.070
NYPD.

14:33.706 --> 14:35.342
Why does that never work?

14:35.375 --> 14:37.510
Watch it, watch it!

14:38.645 --> 14:40.680
Hey, buddy.

14:40.713 --> 14:42.449
Nice move.

14:42.482 --> 14:44.584
I'm not holding, man.
Search me all you want.

14:44.617 --> 14:47.587
Here's something you've
never heard a cop say:

14:47.620 --> 14:49.322
I'm gonna take
your word for it.

14:49.356 --> 14:50.490
Let's go.

14:57.164 --> 15:00.133
FLACK:
Assault, fraud, burglary,
possession of meth,

15:00.167 --> 15:01.601
trafficking in meth,

15:01.634 --> 15:04.571
trafficking in
proscribed wildlife.

15:04.604 --> 15:06.506
"Proscribed wildlife"?

15:06.539 --> 15:08.541
I'm diversifying.

15:08.575 --> 15:09.576
How about murder?

15:09.609 --> 15:12.012
Yeah, stick it all on me.

15:12.045 --> 15:14.014
I'm a pincushion, baby.

15:14.047 --> 15:16.083
Just for giggles,
who'd I kill?

15:16.116 --> 15:18.285
Ashley Braden.

15:22.155 --> 15:23.123
Ashley's dead?

15:23.156 --> 15:24.191
Mm-hmm.

15:24.224 --> 15:26.226
(sighs)

15:27.694 --> 15:30.597
God.

15:30.630 --> 15:32.499
And you think I did it
'cause I got a rap sheet?

15:32.532 --> 15:33.533
DANVILLE:
We found your blood

15:33.566 --> 15:35.202
on her clothes.

15:35.235 --> 15:37.204
What?
How'd you cut your hand?

15:37.237 --> 15:39.372
Are you kidding me?
I would never...

15:39.406 --> 15:40.707
That's not the answer
I'm looking for, Skiver.

15:40.740 --> 15:44.277
Uh... it's a bite,
feeding the toucan.

15:45.612 --> 15:48.248
Those things are nasty.
(chuckles)

15:48.281 --> 15:50.617
Thought you were going to
come up with something lame.

15:50.650 --> 15:52.585
When did you last see Ashley?

15:52.619 --> 15:54.454
Uh, Saturday night,
at her place.

15:54.487 --> 15:56.689
She told me she couldn't
see me anymore.

15:56.723 --> 16:00.493
Didn't want to give her
boyfriend the wrong idea.

16:00.527 --> 16:02.029
She was all dressed up...

16:02.062 --> 16:02.996
She was going out?

16:03.030 --> 16:04.231
Yeah.

16:04.264 --> 16:05.665
With Richie Rich.

16:05.698 --> 16:07.534
The boyfriend.

16:07.567 --> 16:09.336
He was throwing some big thing

16:09.369 --> 16:10.770
at the castle in Central Park.

16:10.803 --> 16:12.539
Does he have a name?

16:12.572 --> 16:13.673
She wouldn't tell me.

16:13.706 --> 16:15.508
Sounds to me like
Ashley dumped you.

16:16.743 --> 16:18.545
That must've made you
pretty angry.

16:18.578 --> 16:19.712
You don't understand.

16:19.746 --> 16:20.713
When I met Ashley,

16:20.747 --> 16:23.150
her folks had just been
killed in a car crash.

16:23.183 --> 16:24.784
She was alone.

16:24.817 --> 16:26.719
And, yeah, she got into a lot
of dark stuff 'cause of me.

16:26.753 --> 16:28.188
That's what
made me pretty angry.

16:28.221 --> 16:30.190
When she told me
she was moving on,

16:30.223 --> 16:31.491
yeah, it broke my heart.

16:31.524 --> 16:33.760
But I was happy for her.

16:35.528 --> 16:38.098
How did your blood
end up on her dress?

16:38.131 --> 16:40.533
I don't know.

16:40.567 --> 16:44.104
Must've been when I was
giving her a hug good-bye.

16:49.476 --> 16:54.114
I would never do
anything to hurt Ashley.

16:58.851 --> 17:00.353
You believe him?

17:00.387 --> 17:02.055
He was alone most
of the evening,

17:02.089 --> 17:03.790
no one to corroborate
his alibi.

17:03.823 --> 17:06.259
His blood's on
our victim's dress.

17:06.292 --> 17:08.060
A toucan? Really?

17:08.095 --> 17:09.296
Had a cousin that
worked with birds.

17:09.329 --> 17:10.597
They can be vicious.

17:10.630 --> 17:13.733
We need to put Skiver in Central
Park at the time of the murder,

17:13.766 --> 17:15.335
with that rock in his hand.

17:15.367 --> 17:18.204
And then there's always
the new boyfriend.
Run with it.

17:18.238 --> 17:20.140
In the meantime, we're going
back to the crime scene.

17:20.173 --> 17:21.273
All right.

17:23.310 --> 17:25.811
EDNA matched the leaf
to Hibiscus moscheutos.

17:25.845 --> 17:27.814
It only grows around here.

17:27.847 --> 17:30.517
Who catalogs every plant
in Central Park?

17:30.550 --> 17:32.185
I'm guessing single guy,

17:32.219 --> 17:34.154
no kids.

17:34.187 --> 17:35.488
Is that it?

17:39.226 --> 17:40.193
Boom.

17:40.227 --> 17:42.395
Let's see what we can find.

17:42.429 --> 17:45.098
Did she just use my word?

18:17.164 --> 18:19.166
*

18:43.356 --> 18:45.358
*

18:52.799 --> 18:54.434
FLACK:
Hey, Mac.

18:54.467 --> 18:55.768
Park operations put me onto

18:55.802 --> 18:57.170
the caterer of
Saturday night's party.

18:57.204 --> 18:58.671
I should have
the guest list ASAP.

18:58.705 --> 19:00.807
I understand there was
some serious money

19:00.840 --> 19:03.410
in Belvedere Castle
the other night.

19:03.443 --> 19:04.877
Over 300 people.
Manhattan's elite.

19:04.911 --> 19:06.246
That's a lot of suspects.

19:06.279 --> 19:07.747
Hoping the guest list
can narrow it down

19:07.780 --> 19:09.216
to Ashley and a plus-one.

19:09.249 --> 19:10.217
The boyfriend?

19:10.250 --> 19:11.351
Got my fingers crossed.

19:12.385 --> 19:14.221
This area open
to the public?

19:14.254 --> 19:15.688
Only during private events.

19:15.722 --> 19:17.824
All those people,

19:17.857 --> 19:20.393
and not one of them
reported Ashley Braden missing.

19:20.427 --> 19:22.795
Why?

19:52.759 --> 19:54.761
*

20:20.987 --> 20:22.989
*

20:52.919 --> 20:54.921
*

21:22.615 --> 21:24.617
*

21:29.456 --> 21:31.458
(computer beeps)

21:35.662 --> 21:37.630
(footsteps approaching)

21:37.664 --> 21:38.765
DANNY:
You ever see me

21:38.798 --> 21:41.067
rip up a check for 50 grand,
do me a favor and shoot me.

21:41.100 --> 21:43.403
Consider it done.
Okay.

21:43.436 --> 21:45.805
'Cause the paper that Sid
found on the vic's body

21:45.838 --> 21:48.375
is a match to the check that
I recovered at the crime scene.

21:48.408 --> 21:49.041
HAWKES:
Also found blood trace
on a jewelry clasp.

21:49.075 --> 21:50.577
It doesn't belong to Skiver.

21:52.879 --> 21:54.481
Neither does the check.

21:54.514 --> 21:56.349
DANNY:
It does connect
to Ashley Braden.

21:56.383 --> 21:59.085
I filled in
the missing letters.

21:59.118 --> 22:01.020
Fits like a glass slipper, no?

22:01.053 --> 22:03.523
$50,000 check
made out to our vic.

22:03.556 --> 22:05.825
Hmm. Not much left
of the signature.

22:05.858 --> 22:07.059
No.

22:07.093 --> 22:10.363
It ends with E-L-L-O,
or-or I-L-L-O.

22:10.397 --> 22:12.565
(phone rings)

22:12.599 --> 22:14.033
Taylor.

22:14.066 --> 22:15.034
Hey, Mac.

22:15.067 --> 22:16.769
So Ashley Braden was a guest

22:16.803 --> 22:19.105
of the vice president
of the Coronation Group.

22:19.138 --> 22:21.574
A guy by the name
of Matthew DiBello.

22:21.608 --> 22:23.410
DiBello. Matthew DiBello.

22:23.443 --> 22:24.411
Perfect.

22:24.444 --> 22:25.578
Hold on.

22:27.914 --> 22:29.416
That's our guy.

22:29.449 --> 22:30.417
I'll meet you there.

22:31.183 --> 22:33.052
Boom.

22:35.755 --> 22:38.625
FLACK:
Do you know an Ashley Braden?

22:38.658 --> 22:39.492
Yes, why?

22:39.526 --> 22:41.494
When was the last
time you saw her?

22:41.528 --> 22:42.895
Saturday night.

22:42.929 --> 22:44.063
We had a corporate function.

22:44.096 --> 22:45.064
And how did that go?

22:45.097 --> 22:46.098
Fine.

22:46.132 --> 22:49.035
No issues with Ashley?

22:49.068 --> 22:51.571
We... had words.

22:51.604 --> 22:53.473
What's going on?

22:53.506 --> 22:55.442
You haven't seen her
for three days,

22:55.475 --> 22:58.144
but you haven't
reported her missing.

22:58.177 --> 22:59.412
Because she isn't missing.

22:59.446 --> 23:00.647
She's in Kansas City.

23:00.680 --> 23:02.449
And you know that because...

23:02.482 --> 23:04.083
I got a text
from her Sunday morning,

23:04.116 --> 23:06.886
saying she was going there
for a few days to cool off.

23:06.919 --> 23:09.088
That's not what
happened, Matthew.

23:09.121 --> 23:10.823
I don't understand.

23:12.058 --> 23:13.159
She's was murdered.

23:13.192 --> 23:15.161
Saturday night in the park.

23:15.194 --> 23:16.128
Ashley?

23:16.162 --> 23:17.830
No, no, no.

23:17.864 --> 23:20.066
(door opens)
She's in Kansas City.

23:20.099 --> 23:21.968
Matthew, I was wondering...
Oh, I'm sorry.

23:22.001 --> 23:23.670
I didn't know you were
in a meeting.

23:23.703 --> 23:26.506
What's wrong?

23:26.539 --> 23:29.709
Ashley's been murdered.

23:29.742 --> 23:32.078
Oh, Matthew, what?

23:32.111 --> 23:34.747
Detectives,
this is my mother,

23:34.781 --> 23:36.282
Krista DiBello.

23:36.315 --> 23:39.452
Why don't you tell us
a little more about the
words you had with Ashley.

23:42.254 --> 23:46.225
Ashley, uh, was late.

23:46.258 --> 23:48.861
We argued.

23:48.895 --> 23:50.129
She left.

23:50.162 --> 23:51.698
Did it get physical?

23:51.731 --> 23:52.865
Did I hit her?

23:52.899 --> 23:54.534
No.

23:56.603 --> 23:58.871
I grabbed her wrist.

23:58.905 --> 24:00.239
Her jewelry
must've scratched me,

24:00.272 --> 24:01.974
but I never hit her.

24:02.008 --> 24:03.810
FLACK:
You know she had a history,

24:03.843 --> 24:06.078
a criminal record,
some shady friends?

24:06.112 --> 24:08.481
That wasn't a secret,
and it didn't matter to us.

24:08.515 --> 24:11.851
Then why'd you write her
a check for $50,000?

24:11.884 --> 24:13.185
I didn't.

24:13.219 --> 24:14.954
I've never seen
that check before.

24:14.987 --> 24:17.524
Is that your signature?

24:17.557 --> 24:18.991
It must be a forgery.

24:19.025 --> 24:21.460
A lot of people have access
to your personal checkbook?

24:24.163 --> 24:27.033
I can't explain that check,

24:27.066 --> 24:29.969
but there's something you have
to understand about Ashley.

24:30.002 --> 24:31.838
She was honest with me.

24:31.871 --> 24:33.940
I knew about her past,

24:33.973 --> 24:36.809
and it only made me
love her more.

24:36.843 --> 24:38.177
There was no blackmail,

24:38.210 --> 24:40.212
if that's what
you're suggesting.

24:40.246 --> 24:42.715
You won't mind
if we take a DNA sample.

24:42.749 --> 24:46.553
I think I should consult
my attorney.

24:46.586 --> 24:47.720
I thought you had
nothing to hide?

24:47.754 --> 24:50.022
KRISTA:
Gentlemen, I understand
you have to do your job,

24:50.056 --> 24:51.658
but let me be very clear.

24:51.691 --> 24:54.193
Matthew loved Ashley.

24:54.226 --> 24:55.194
He never,

24:55.227 --> 24:56.796
never could have
hurt her.

24:59.766 --> 25:02.802
I'll give you whatever you need.

25:02.835 --> 25:03.803
GIRL:
So did the prince

25:03.836 --> 25:05.271
do it or not?

25:05.304 --> 25:05.905
Ah.

25:05.938 --> 25:07.674
Even if he did the crime,

25:07.707 --> 25:09.709
he won't be doing the time.

25:09.742 --> 25:12.211
Whoa, my story, my moral.

25:12.244 --> 25:14.581
His reaction was genuine.

25:14.614 --> 25:16.282
He didn't know Ashley
Braden was dead.

25:16.315 --> 25:18.551
Okay, but he's lying
about something.

25:18.585 --> 25:21.087
We need to track down
Ashley's cell.

25:39.171 --> 25:41.540
Do you believe in luck?

25:42.308 --> 25:44.744
Well, uh,

25:44.777 --> 25:47.179
Seneca said,
"Luck is the intersection

25:47.213 --> 25:49.315
of preparation and opportunity."

25:49.348 --> 25:51.350
Well, then opportunity
just knocked.

25:51.383 --> 25:55.021
Do you know
where the midtown Manhattan

25:55.054 --> 25:56.989
meteorological station
is located?

25:57.023 --> 25:58.024
Belvedere Castle.

25:58.057 --> 25:59.258
50 feet from where

25:59.291 --> 26:01.628
I found a single blood drop,
footprints

26:01.661 --> 26:03.896
and a bizarre
circular divot pattern.

26:03.930 --> 26:05.632
Sid estimated
the time of death

26:05.665 --> 26:06.899
as around midnight.

26:06.933 --> 26:10.637
On Saturday night
at precisely 12:01 a.m.,

26:10.670 --> 26:11.838
it started raining.

26:11.871 --> 26:14.273
And then at 12:14, it stopped.

26:14.306 --> 26:15.808
The circular divot pattern

26:15.842 --> 26:18.144
was from somebody holding
an umbrella.

26:18.177 --> 26:19.245
Which means
they had to be standing there

26:19.278 --> 26:22.348
for at least some part
of that 13 minutes.
Right,

26:22.381 --> 26:24.383
and also the pieces
of the check that Danny found

26:24.416 --> 26:28.287
across the lake, they also had
water damage from the rain.

26:28.320 --> 26:31.190
This umbrella duplicates
the ring pattern

26:31.223 --> 26:32.659
I found at the site.

26:34.126 --> 26:36.228
Then I calibrated
this pressure-sensitive mat

26:36.262 --> 26:37.730
to register

26:37.764 --> 26:38.898
the exact same depth

26:38.931 --> 26:41.033
of penetration as the raindrops.

26:41.067 --> 26:42.869
The only variable is the height

26:42.902 --> 26:44.336
of the person holding
the umbrella.

26:44.370 --> 26:46.806
Right, now most people
hold an umbrella

26:46.839 --> 26:49.075
with their forearm
at a 45 degree angle.

26:49.108 --> 26:51.243
And at the site, I measured
a depth of penetration

26:51.277 --> 26:53.212
of 3/16 of an inch.

26:53.245 --> 26:55.314
So, if I plug those

26:55.347 --> 26:57.349
into a height formula...

27:02.154 --> 27:03.322
Five-11.

27:03.355 --> 27:05.091
That's brains, not luck.

27:06.458 --> 27:08.928
So what about the
blood you found?

27:09.929 --> 27:11.964
Well, the umbrella
protected it

27:11.998 --> 27:13.132
from the rain.

27:13.165 --> 27:14.934
Right, unfortunately...
No hit in CODIS.

27:14.967 --> 27:16.335
Right, but the footprints

27:16.368 --> 27:18.404
that I discovered at the scene,
they faced

27:18.437 --> 27:21.674
away from the Belvedere Castle
towards the pond.

27:21.708 --> 27:22.541
Male, size 11,

27:22.574 --> 27:25.277
slight over-pronation
of the right foot.

27:25.311 --> 27:27.213
No logo or brand name.

27:27.246 --> 27:29.716
There's something even
better. See that line?

27:29.749 --> 27:31.684
It's pretty unique stitching.

27:31.718 --> 27:33.052
There's only shoemaker
that does that,

27:33.085 --> 27:34.153
Felitti.

27:34.186 --> 27:35.187
Not cheap.

27:35.221 --> 27:36.288
So, we have footprints

27:36.322 --> 27:38.090
across the lake,

27:38.124 --> 27:41.227
outside the Belvedere Castle,
pointing towards the pond

27:41.260 --> 27:43.963
right around the time that
we think Ashley was killed.

27:43.996 --> 27:46.365
We have a witness.
Yes.

27:56.408 --> 27:57.977
(indistinct noise on headphones)

28:06.853 --> 28:08.788
(indistinct transmission)

28:17.263 --> 28:19.698
(loud rumbling static)

28:25.437 --> 28:27.439
(indistinct voice)

28:30.509 --> 28:31.978
You heard aliens talking?

28:32.011 --> 28:33.412
You know, who knows?

28:33.445 --> 28:36.115
I don't even know
if they have mouths.

28:36.148 --> 28:37.750
All I know for sure is

28:37.784 --> 28:40.820
that it's some form
of communication.

28:40.853 --> 28:43.355
Sounds waves from the middle
of the spaceship.

28:43.389 --> 28:47.426
Which means I've discovered
first contact.

28:47.459 --> 28:50.462
Boo-yah. Mmm.

28:50.496 --> 28:52.298
So what happened next
with the dead lady?

28:52.331 --> 28:54.967
Really?

28:55.802 --> 28:57.804
Just got DiBello's swab.

28:57.837 --> 29:01.207
It's his blood on the clasp that
Hawkes found across the pond.

29:01.240 --> 29:03.810
It puts him at the crime scene.

29:03.843 --> 29:05.812
Yeah, it's also his blood
near the footprints I found

29:05.845 --> 29:07.113
on the landing
at Belvedere Castle.

29:07.146 --> 29:08.447
He's five-foot 11,

29:08.480 --> 29:09.849
he wears size 11 shoes,

29:09.882 --> 29:11.550
and he can
certainly afford Felitti's.

29:11.583 --> 29:14.220
Puts him in two places
at the same time.

29:15.587 --> 29:18.958
Is he our killer or our witness?

29:32.571 --> 29:34.206
Somebody looks like
they're in a hurry.
Yep.

29:38.310 --> 29:39.378
(gunshot)

29:39.411 --> 29:40.479
(people screaming)

29:40.512 --> 29:42.448
Everybody get down!

29:43.115 --> 29:44.216
Drop that gun now!

29:44.851 --> 29:45.852
Hey, drop it!

29:45.885 --> 29:47.319
Drop that gun!

29:47.353 --> 29:48.554
That was for Ashley,
you son of a bitch!

29:48.587 --> 29:50.556
Put your hands on
your head right now.

29:50.589 --> 29:52.791
Don't move. Don't move.

29:56.495 --> 29:59.465
Get this hand up here.
I need an ambulance

29:59.498 --> 30:01.067
at the Coronation
Group Plaza,

30:01.100 --> 30:02.168
122 Broad.

30:02.201 --> 30:03.870
Shooting, a man down.

30:03.903 --> 30:06.338
Ambulance is on its way.

30:06.372 --> 30:09.608
So the princess
and the prince get killed?

30:09.641 --> 30:11.277
No, he wasn't killed.

30:11.310 --> 30:15.014
He just was in no shape to talk,
which left us stumped.

30:15.047 --> 30:17.616
What about the text the Bello
guy got from the princess?

30:17.649 --> 30:22.421
Ah, and that's exactly what
the boss cop asked me to find.

30:22.454 --> 30:23.856
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

30:23.890 --> 30:26.025
What happened to the spaceship?

30:26.058 --> 30:28.327
(laughs)
Another great question.

30:37.069 --> 30:38.971
Any luck?

30:39.005 --> 30:40.606
Still waiting
on a cell tower

30:40.639 --> 30:42.441
to pick up a signal
from Ashley Braden's phone.

30:42.474 --> 30:45.878
But that is not the reason
why I called you up here, Sid.

30:45.912 --> 30:47.379
What does that
look like to you?

30:47.413 --> 30:48.380
Uh...

30:48.414 --> 30:51.550
maybe the molecular structure

30:51.583 --> 30:52.584
of threonine?

30:52.618 --> 30:53.886
No, think bigger.

30:53.920 --> 30:55.287
Bigger. Um,

30:55.321 --> 30:56.956
flights out of O'Hare.
Bigger.

30:56.989 --> 31:01.327
Okay, then,
how about a star map?

31:01.360 --> 31:03.963
Yes, thank you. I knew
you'd get it. Yeah.

31:03.996 --> 31:06.966
These lines right are radiating
from Alpha Centauri,

31:06.999 --> 31:08.200
the closet star to earth,

31:08.234 --> 31:10.369
the closest source of
extraterrestrial life,

31:10.402 --> 31:12.371
and the most likely source

31:12.404 --> 31:13.605
of this.

31:16.608 --> 31:18.577
Uh, may I?

31:18.610 --> 31:21.080
Easy.

31:21.113 --> 31:21.780
Okay.

31:21.813 --> 31:25.051
I found it in Turtle Pond, Sid.

31:25.084 --> 31:27.053
Do you know what this could do?

31:27.086 --> 31:29.621
Uh, protect a tabletop
from a wet drink.

31:29.655 --> 31:32.658
Launch an industry, okay?

31:32.691 --> 31:35.928
Graphic novels, TV series,
movie, theme parks, restaurants.

31:35.962 --> 31:37.396
I already got a name for it.

31:37.429 --> 31:39.065
ARea 52.

31:39.098 --> 31:41.333
The A and the R are capitalized,
because...

31:41.367 --> 31:43.002
Oh, Adam Ross.

31:43.035 --> 31:45.071
What up?
Yes, very clever.

31:45.104 --> 31:46.438
And ambitious.

31:46.472 --> 31:49.075
Exactly, but since this is
a ground floor startup,

31:49.108 --> 31:52.544
I'm willing
to give you, Sid, 49%

31:52.578 --> 31:57.283
for only $284,000, yeah.

31:57.316 --> 31:58.617
Dollars?

31:58.650 --> 32:01.120
Uh, well, that sounds
like a bargain.

32:01.153 --> 32:04.023
You know, you'd be part
of all major decisions.

32:04.056 --> 32:05.324
I'd love to hear your
business advice,

32:05.357 --> 32:06.492
but of course,
at the end of the day,

32:06.525 --> 32:07.693
someone has to have
the final say.

32:07.726 --> 32:09.561
I understand.

32:09.595 --> 32:12.131
In fact,
I already have some advice.

32:12.164 --> 32:13.632
Great, shoot. What?

32:13.665 --> 32:17.136
Don't pitch this to anyone
who can fire you.

32:25.011 --> 32:27.646
(clears throat)

32:27.679 --> 32:29.681
Whatever.

32:37.789 --> 32:39.325
Jo!

32:48.267 --> 32:50.236
This guy's pulling
into every dead end

32:50.269 --> 32:52.404
and alley in the city.
What's up with that?

32:52.438 --> 32:55.307
He's stopped again,

32:55.341 --> 32:57.376
just around the corner.
I'm gonna get out here.

32:57.409 --> 32:59.278
Okay, well, um,

32:59.311 --> 33:02.514
you know, I'll park and, uh,

33:02.548 --> 33:04.116
I will, I'll catch up.

33:07.753 --> 33:09.721
Jo?

33:09.755 --> 33:11.723
That's it?

33:11.757 --> 33:13.225
That's it.

33:13.259 --> 33:14.760
Our killer must've used
Ashley's phone,

33:14.793 --> 33:16.562
and then dumped it.

33:18.397 --> 33:19.598
You find any spaceships?

33:19.631 --> 33:21.733
That's very funny, Jo.
That's real funny.

33:21.767 --> 33:23.535
Hey, you want any coffee?

33:23.569 --> 33:26.172
I just found a place
down the block.

33:26.205 --> 33:27.306
Oh, I got it!

33:27.339 --> 33:29.141
Wow.

33:32.744 --> 33:35.114
(grunts)
Oh, yeah.

33:36.348 --> 33:38.117
(exhales)

33:39.551 --> 33:44.056
The cell phone was...
always sending a signal.

33:44.090 --> 33:46.758
It just was in a Dumpster
underground.

33:46.792 --> 33:49.395
Till trash day, and
the truck picked it up.

33:52.764 --> 33:55.101
Look, if we cross-reference
the truck route,

33:55.134 --> 33:57.736
maybe it'll lead us to an
address where the suspect is.

33:57.769 --> 34:00.072
Good idea.

34:01.807 --> 34:05.444
Garbage truck routes
run along Fifth Avenue.

34:05.477 --> 34:07.313
I parked right here.

34:07.346 --> 34:08.347
What?

34:08.380 --> 34:09.681
No!

34:09.715 --> 34:11.516
No, oh, no!

34:11.550 --> 34:14.120
This isn't happening!

34:14.152 --> 34:16.255
Jo, somebody stole the car.
Somebody stole the Avalanche.

34:16.288 --> 34:17.489
Mac is gonna kill me!

34:17.523 --> 34:19.190
Oh, Adam, you're brilliant.
We got a name.

34:19.225 --> 34:21.092
"DiBello."

34:21.127 --> 34:23.562
Taxi!

34:23.594 --> 34:25.164
That's great. I can handle this.

34:25.197 --> 34:27.132
Yeah, you go.

34:27.166 --> 34:30.802
I'll handle this...
and my funeral arrangements.

34:30.835 --> 34:32.838
Oh, my God.

34:40.812 --> 34:42.380
(siren chirps)

34:43.581 --> 34:46.152
(indistinct radio transmission)

34:52.558 --> 34:53.859
You need to leave
my son alone.

34:53.891 --> 34:55.594
He's done nothing,
and you know it.

34:55.627 --> 34:58.164
You're right.
But we're not here for him.

34:58.197 --> 35:01.367
What? This is ridiculous.
Why would you think

35:01.400 --> 35:03.602
I had anything to do
with Ashley's death?

35:05.337 --> 35:06.605
Recognize this?

35:06.638 --> 35:08.640
You used it
to send a text

35:08.674 --> 35:11.109
to your son,
throw everyone off the trail.

35:12.178 --> 35:14.180
That's it?

35:14.213 --> 35:15.781
We also have an eyewitness.

35:24.523 --> 35:27.893
Matthew is not going
to help you.

35:27.926 --> 35:30.762
You killed your
son's girlfriend.

35:30.796 --> 35:33.465
I'd say all bets
are pretty much off.

35:33.499 --> 35:37.169
I didn't kill anyone,
and he knows that.

35:37.203 --> 35:38.937
He was there,
Mrs. DiBello,

35:38.970 --> 35:40.772
when you put Ashley's body
in the boat

35:40.806 --> 35:42.941
and pushed it into the pond.

35:42.974 --> 35:46.178
He didn't see anything.

35:46.212 --> 35:48.480
DANVILLE:
We found your footprints
and blood,

35:48.514 --> 35:50.349
and the rain gave us
the exact time,

35:50.382 --> 35:51.683
so we know
you were there,

35:51.717 --> 35:54.586
and we know you saw something.

35:54.620 --> 35:57.823
It was dark.

35:57.856 --> 36:00.492
You know, Matthew,

36:00.526 --> 36:03.562
I have a son that's not much
younger than you are,

36:03.595 --> 36:07.366
and I, oh, I treasure
his loyalty.

36:07.399 --> 36:11.670
But more important than that,
I value his principles.

36:11.703 --> 36:13.739
If he were
to encounter a wrong,

36:13.772 --> 36:15.674
I trust that he would
come forward

36:15.707 --> 36:17.209
and do
the right thing

36:17.243 --> 36:19.545
no matter who did it.

36:21.447 --> 36:25.251
I'm sorry. I can't help you.

36:28.887 --> 36:31.457
And the more I learned
about Ashley,

36:31.490 --> 36:34.393
the more impressed I am.

36:34.426 --> 36:37.396
She had so much
to overcome.

36:39.398 --> 36:42.234
But no one does
anything alone.

36:42.268 --> 36:44.270
She needed a partner
in life,

36:44.303 --> 36:46.905
and she finally found
that in you.

36:46.938 --> 36:49.941
Someone stable
and supportive.

36:49.975 --> 36:51.710
Someone she could
make a life with.

36:51.743 --> 36:54.313
Someone she could count on.

37:00.986 --> 37:04.723
That's what
your mother did to her.

37:04.756 --> 37:07.959
And you may not be able
to bring Ashley back, Matthew,

37:07.993 --> 37:10.729
but there is something
you can do for her.

37:12.998 --> 37:14.933
She's still counting on you.

37:21.973 --> 37:23.909
(knocking)

37:26.044 --> 37:29.014
Matthew would like
to talk to his mother.

37:44.963 --> 37:46.898
How are you feeling?

37:46.932 --> 37:50.035
What do you mean?

37:50.068 --> 37:51.337
How is your shoulder?

37:51.370 --> 37:53.972
My shoulder
will heal.

38:00.812 --> 38:02.414
Matthew, you've been shot.

38:04.115 --> 38:05.984
Honey, you're grieving.

38:06.017 --> 38:07.085
Why am I grieving, Mom?

38:07.118 --> 38:08.520
Matthew...

38:08.554 --> 38:09.955
Why am I grieving?!

38:09.988 --> 38:12.924
Because you lost a friend,

38:12.958 --> 38:15.293
who will be missed...
You hated her guts!

38:16.094 --> 38:17.696
She didn't like high heels,

38:17.729 --> 38:19.665
she-she wasn't Catholic,
she didn't come from money.

38:19.698 --> 38:22.768
She was a drug addict
and so was her boyfriend.

38:22.801 --> 38:24.803
I was her boyfriend.

38:24.836 --> 38:27.473
She was wrong for you, Matthew.
She didn't belong.

38:27.506 --> 38:28.374
So you killed her?

38:28.407 --> 38:30.842
She was a virus!

38:32.378 --> 38:34.380
She was being introduced
to people

38:34.413 --> 38:36.114
worth tens of millions
of dollars,

38:36.147 --> 38:40.352
and she is saying
"lovely to twalk to you."

38:40.386 --> 38:42.888
I thought if you saw her
all dressed up

38:42.921 --> 38:44.556
you might give her a chance.

38:45.557 --> 38:47.493
She hated putting
on a show,

38:47.526 --> 38:51.363
but she did it for you,
to impress you.

38:54.533 --> 38:56.101
Ashley, wait!

38:56.134 --> 38:57.536
We have to talk
about this!

38:59.505 --> 39:01.339
No, we don't.

39:03.709 --> 39:05.811
So that's when you went
after her.

39:08.046 --> 39:11.116
I figured this was my chance.

39:11.149 --> 39:12.117
To kill her?

39:12.150 --> 39:13.919
To bribe her.

39:13.952 --> 39:15.487
Take this.

39:15.521 --> 39:17.623
I never wanted her dead.

39:17.656 --> 39:19.525
It's $50,000.

39:19.558 --> 39:21.059
I just wanted her gone.

39:21.092 --> 39:23.395
What do you
think I am?

39:23.429 --> 39:25.063
(grunts)

39:28.166 --> 39:30.569
TAYLOR:
You took her bracelet?

39:30.602 --> 39:35.373
My bracelet, given to me
by my grandmother.

39:37.008 --> 39:40.679
(voice breaks):
I had no idea
Matthew was watching.

39:57.195 --> 39:59.965
I didn't put it together
until the police told me

39:59.998 --> 40:01.467
that Ashley was dead.

40:01.500 --> 40:05.871
Didn't realize
I'd seen her murder.

40:05.904 --> 40:10.175
The D.A. will have
more questions.

40:10.208 --> 40:11.777
And your mother...

40:11.810 --> 40:13.612
I don't care about her.

40:16.482 --> 40:17.816
Am I free to go?

40:17.849 --> 40:20.486
Yes, you are.

40:23.522 --> 40:26.124
Whoa, that prince's old lady
is cold.

40:26.157 --> 40:27.826
Is she gonna fry?

40:27.859 --> 40:29.995
No, they don't fry people
in New York,

40:30.028 --> 40:33.231
but she is gonna go away
for a very, very long time.

40:33.264 --> 40:35.133
Ooh, there's Mama.

40:35.166 --> 40:37.235
(mouthing)

40:37.268 --> 40:40.005
Wait. What about the end
of the spaceship story?

40:40.038 --> 40:42.173
Well, that's all I got
for right now.

40:42.207 --> 40:44.075
I tell you what?

40:44.109 --> 40:46.244
This story is just beginning.

40:46.277 --> 40:47.479
Cool.

40:47.513 --> 40:48.847
All right.

40:48.880 --> 40:49.881
Come on.

40:50.949 --> 40:52.518
Bye.
Bye.

40:53.284 --> 40:56.221
That dude, he's gonna be
richer than Carmelo.

40:57.222 --> 40:58.590
Bye.

41:00.859 --> 41:03.261
Heading home, Detective?

41:03.294 --> 41:05.997
No, no, I gotta
get back to the...

41:10.301 --> 41:12.504
the, uh...

41:12.538 --> 41:15.106
The lab?

41:15.140 --> 41:18.176
(chuckles)
The lab, yeah.

41:18.209 --> 41:20.111
It's been a long day.

41:20.145 --> 41:22.113
There you go.
Thank you.

41:30.589 --> 41:33.559
(keys beeping, line ringing)

41:35.293 --> 41:37.195
(beeps)

41:37.228 --> 41:42.000
Christine, uh, it's... it's me.

41:42.033 --> 41:43.802
We need to talk. I'm, uh...

41:43.835 --> 41:46.237
There is something wrong.

41:47.573 --> 41:49.808
To send your message, press one.

41:49.841 --> 41:52.210
To delete your message,
press two.

42:04.823 --> 42:06.825
(phone rings)

42:10.762 --> 42:12.130
When are you
gonna tell him?

42:13.699 --> 42:14.966
They found
the Avalanche.

42:15.000 --> 42:17.636
Oh, great. Where?

42:17.669 --> 42:19.571
Impound.

42:19.605 --> 42:22.140
You parked in
the red zone.

42:22.173 --> 42:24.943
Next time, put the placard
in the window.

42:24.976 --> 42:28.814
And when did you find
this out?

42:28.847 --> 42:30.749
I've had a lot on
my plate today.

42:30.782 --> 42:31.750
Well, you know, so did I.

42:31.783 --> 42:34.586
It's a lot more important
than sitting here.

42:34.620 --> 42:38.289
Well, maybe this will help:
Mikhail Gorbachev.

42:40.959 --> 42:42.861
Mikha...

42:42.894 --> 42:47.065
Gorbachev. What?

42:47.098 --> 42:49.868
(indistinct sounds
playing from computer)

42:55.006 --> 42:57.976
Phobos One?

42:58.009 --> 42:59.010
Not from Alpha Centauri?

42:59.044 --> 43:01.112
Kazakhstan.

43:01.146 --> 43:03.682
Martian probe launched
by the Russians

43:03.715 --> 43:06.885
in 1988.
They lost track of it, but...

43:07.986 --> 43:09.721
...looks like one piece of it

43:09.755 --> 43:11.089
found its way back home.

43:11.122 --> 43:15.861
Yeah. Animal sounds, car horns,
the word "earth"

43:15.894 --> 43:20.365
recorded in 37 different
languages, 1988's Top Ten hits.

43:20.398 --> 43:24.102
This was Russia's
interplanetary greeting card.

43:24.135 --> 43:25.837
There had some good stuff
in '88.

43:25.871 --> 43:27.372
"Red, Red Wine,"

43:27.405 --> 43:30.809
"Kokomo,"
"Don't Worry, Be Happy."

43:30.842 --> 43:31.843
Do you remember that?

43:31.877 --> 43:33.011
Yes, I do.

43:33.044 --> 43:37.082
* Here is a little song
I wrote *

43:37.115 --> 43:39.084
* You might want to sing it
note for note *

43:39.117 --> 43:39.184
* Don't worry, be happy.
