Previously on ‘Boston Legal’…

00:01.584 --> 00:03.590
Clarence, wig off!

00:03.590 --> 00:04.486
Take off the wig.

00:04.486 --> 00:05.951
Take off the wig, Clarence.

00:05.951 --> 00:08.079
It's too high-pressure.
I have to be her.

00:08.079 --> 00:09.213
You pass the bar, Clarence?

00:09.213 --> 00:11.173
Yes, but I could never practice.

00:11.173 --> 00:12.420
I think we're gonna work on that.

00:12.420 --> 00:14.348
I'm Buzz Lightyear here.
Ask anybody.

00:14.348 --> 00:16.283
I've always been Buzz.

00:17.109 --> 00:18.983
Now what is this really about?

00:18.983 --> 00:19.837
I'm pregnant.

00:19.837 --> 00:23.098
I would like to know
who the paternal parent is.

00:23.098 --> 00:24.825
–What's going on?
–The results are back.

00:24.825 --> 00:26.665
–And?
–And…

00:26.665 --> 00:29.123
it's Brad's.
You're off the hook.

00:52.961 --> 00:55.181
Case number 36742.

00:55.181 --> 00:57.887
The Commonwealth of Massachusetts
vs George Cogins

00:57.887 --> 01:00.923
on the charge of aggravated assault.

01:01.476 --> 01:02.975
Clarence?

01:04.062 --> 01:05.066
Bethany.

01:05.066 --> 01:07.119
We've met at Crane, Poole & Schmidt.

01:07.119 --> 01:08.716
Yes, hello.

01:08.716 --> 01:10.473
What are you doing here?

01:10.473 --> 01:13.465
I came to get an appointment,

01:13.465 --> 01:15.291
a court appointment.

01:15.291 --> 01:16.754
You're a lawyer?

01:16.754 --> 01:19.003
I, I went to law school.

01:19.003 --> 01:21.709
I've never practiced,

01:21.709 --> 01:23.180
but I want to start.

01:23.180 --> 01:26.359
Clarence Bell.
Bell, Bell, Bell…

01:28.119 --> 01:31.105
Is there an attorney Bell here or not?

01:33.019 --> 01:35.245
Does it look like
we have all day here?

01:35.245 --> 01:36.804
When I call an attorney's name,

01:36.804 --> 01:40.135
I expect him to step forward
and get the hell over here.

01:40.135 --> 01:41.880
Ms Gadios, here's your attorney.

01:41.880 --> 01:43.382
Mr Bell, meet your client.

01:43.382 --> 01:45.919
The defendant is remanded
back to custody. No bail.

01:45.919 --> 01:47.465
We can conference on a trial date.

01:47.465 --> 01:48.713
Next.

01:48.921 --> 01:49.988
Hello.

01:50.938 --> 01:52.438
Here's the file.

01:52.438 --> 01:55.571
We should probably work something out,
save us all a little time.

01:55.571 --> 01:57.406
What is my client charged with?

01:57.406 --> 01:58.346
Funny.

01:58.346 --> 02:00.156
Talk to your client.
Let me know what you want to do.

02:00.156 --> 02:02.813
No, I didn't hear the case call.

02:02.813 --> 02:04.273
What are the charges?

02:04.273 --> 02:06.979
The charges would be
first degree murder.

02:14.824 --> 02:18.822
Boston Legal
3×15 ‘Fat Burner’

02:44.684 --> 02:46.456
Please, don't hate me.

02:46.456 --> 02:47.803
What have you done now?

02:47.803 --> 02:50.494
Oh, nothing really.

02:50.494 --> 02:54.373
It just seems I've gotten myself
slightly arrested.

02:54.808 --> 02:55.644
Again.

02:55.644 --> 02:57.777
Oh, please tell me
you didn't shoot somebody.

02:57.777 --> 03:00.580
No, this concerns an investment.

03:00.580 --> 03:01.523
An investment?

03:01.523 --> 03:04.157
In a company, my company, actually.

03:04.157 --> 03:06.461
I have things on the side.
That's what rich people do.

03:06.461 --> 03:07.900
What kind of company, Denny?

03:07.900 --> 03:13.455
Well, we have solved the country's
obesity problem and energy crisis.

03:13.455 --> 03:14.264
Is that all?

03:14.264 --> 03:16.990
We convert human body fat into fuel.

03:16.990 --> 03:19.226
Brilliant, right?
Too much fat, not enough oil.

03:19.226 --> 03:21.049
Would you care to know
how we do it?

03:21.049 --> 03:22.094
Please.

03:22.094 --> 03:24.635
Well, it seems that human fat

03:24.635 --> 03:28.571
is not so different in chemical
makeup from vegetable oil,

03:28.571 --> 03:30.507
which has already been used
in diesel engines.

03:30.507 --> 03:31.979
So it was just a matter
of getting the fat,

03:31.979 --> 03:34.703
which we did, from
a local Boston hospital.

03:34.703 --> 03:38.953
Ship it to Norway to a friend
who converts it into fuel.

03:38.953 --> 03:41.334
I take it that's illegal?

03:42.007 --> 03:43.315
Technically.

03:43.315 --> 03:48.075
Oh, they're singling me out for
prosecution 'cause it's Denny Crane.

03:48.075 --> 03:51.292
Big name, big splash.

03:51.292 --> 03:54.181
You know where I can find
a good lawyer?

03:54.181 --> 03:56.175
It's never dull, Alan.

03:56.481 --> 03:57.886
Admit it.

04:09.462 --> 04:13.151
–Ow! Oh, yes!
–Come on, daddy!

04:27.115 --> 04:28.940
You want to go in?

04:29.553 --> 04:31.028
Uh…

04:31.683 --> 04:33.006
okay.

04:40.456 --> 04:41.837
Hello.

04:42.187 --> 04:44.736
My name is Clarence Bell.

04:59.613 --> 05:01.412
Do, do you speak English?

05:01.412 --> 05:03.071
Yes.

05:04.115 --> 05:09.296
According to the complaint,
you killed a man.

05:09.296 --> 05:10.851
Yes.

05:10.851 --> 05:14.376
<i>Je suis restavek.</i>

05:14.376 --> 05:17.855
Oh, I, I don't know what that means.

05:17.855 --> 05:20.697
I was his slave.

05:21.958 --> 05:23.019
A slave?

05:23.019 --> 05:26.575
Yes. Her parents sold her
11 years ago in Haïti.

05:26.575 --> 05:28.328
Okay, wait, wait.
Let's back up.

05:28.328 --> 05:30.649
Why are you taking
court appointments?

05:30.649 --> 05:34.734
Clarence, you're a legal secretary,
more importantly, mine.

05:34.734 --> 05:37.873
The stomach flu has wiped out
half the public defender's office.

05:37.873 --> 05:40.552
They're asking for lawyers
to pitch in and help.

05:40.552 --> 05:44.024
I've always wanted to try a real case,

05:44.024 --> 05:46.901
so I went down there.

05:46.901 --> 05:49.714
And decided to start off with
something small like homicide?

05:49.714 --> 05:51.314
I didn't expect that.

05:51.314 --> 05:55.544
Did the judge know you've never practiced
before when he assigned you this?

05:55.544 --> 05:57.049
Uh, no.

05:57.049 --> 05:58.550
Wow…

05:59.182 --> 06:02.362
Clarence, surely, you cannot do this.

06:02.362 --> 06:03.629
I'd like to try.

06:03.629 --> 06:06.055
It's first degree murder.

06:08.644 --> 06:10.602
I can do this.

06:12.358 --> 06:13.532
Represent you?

06:13.532 --> 06:14.466
Yes.

06:14.466 --> 06:16.343
Against Denise?

06:16.633 --> 06:17.757
Yes.

06:17.757 --> 06:19.469
For having your baby?

06:19.469 --> 06:21.227
For not having it.

06:21.492 --> 06:22.906
A father has to have some rights.

06:22.906 --> 06:24.771
No, have you read Roe?

06:24.771 --> 06:27.437
Roe is vulnerable, especially
with our supreme court.

06:27.437 --> 06:29.593
I think this would be a good test case.

06:29.593 --> 06:32.635
How can a father have legal and financial
responsibilities for a child,

06:32.635 --> 06:34.506
yet no rights whatsoever?

06:34.506 --> 06:36.105
Because that's the law.

06:36.105 --> 06:39.207
If men want to have babies
and carry them to full term…

06:39.207 --> 06:40.161
Aha!

06:40.161 --> 06:41.244
Aha?

06:41.244 --> 06:43.391
Is that a legal concept
I'm not aware of?

06:43.391 --> 06:45.577
A woman's body, a woman's choice.

06:45.577 --> 06:48.846
That is the thrust of Roe,
but the science is changing.

06:48.846 --> 06:51.227
A fertilized embryo can be
taken from the birth mother,

06:51.227 --> 06:52.614
transferred to a surrogate.

06:52.614 --> 06:54.680
And a woman isn't forced
to carry a baby to term.

06:54.680 --> 06:57.168
Brad, the medical technology
is not there yet.

06:57.168 --> 07:00.424
What's the risk? A baby dies
during an abortion anyway.

07:00.424 --> 07:02.503
What you're proposing is ridiculous.

07:02.503 --> 07:03.963
I, I'm not going to do it and…

07:03.963 --> 07:05.991
It's my baby, Shirley.

07:06.205 --> 07:07.491
Brad…

07:09.088 --> 07:11.043
it's my choice, not yours.
–Denise…

07:11.043 --> 07:12.339
Shut up.

07:13.327 --> 07:15.768
And my choice…

07:16.429 --> 07:18.744
is to have this child.

07:18.744 --> 07:22.882
So you can stop
all this crap right now.

07:27.193 --> 07:28.987
You must be very pleased.

07:28.987 --> 07:30.627
I like my job,
if that's what you mean.

07:30.627 --> 07:33.621
You're especially liking it today.

07:33.621 --> 07:34.430
I am.

07:34.430 --> 07:37.372
My client is just an investor,
a passive one at that.

07:37.372 --> 07:40.428
He's the majority shareholder
in the company, and its president.

07:40.428 --> 07:41.804
I collect titles.

07:41.804 --> 07:42.850
Hobby, passive.

07:42.850 --> 07:45.491
You sold medical waste, Mr Crane.
That's a crime.

07:45.491 --> 07:48.762
A hospital in Miami does
the very same thing.

07:48.762 --> 07:50.318
That hasn't been confirmed.

07:50.318 --> 07:51.717
What I can confirm

07:51.717 --> 07:54.146
is that if I were a district
attorney in Florida,

07:54.146 --> 07:55.853
I'd go after the hospital.

07:55.853 --> 07:58.551
But I'm not a district attorney in Florida.

07:58.551 --> 08:01.914
I am a district attorney in Massachusetts,

08:01.914 --> 08:04.849
so I'm going after Denny Crane.

08:04.849 --> 08:06.973
I know judges, I know jurors.

08:06.973 --> 08:08.309
I'm rich.
–Denny…

08:08.309 --> 08:11.776
You're going down,
Denny Crane, at last.

08:12.890 --> 08:16.330
Denny Crane never goes down.

08:16.330 --> 08:19.146
Except as a lover.
I'm a giver in bed.

08:19.330 --> 08:20.811
Is that relevant?

08:25.643 --> 08:29.087
I am not passing judgment
on your ability, Clarence,

08:29.087 --> 08:32.702
but I have to worry
about this firm's exposure.

08:32.702 --> 08:36.090
I simply cannot allow you
to do a murder trial.

08:36.090 --> 08:38.823
This woman could sue us
for malpractice.

08:38.823 --> 08:41.844
I got Bethany Horowitz
to back me up.

08:42.097 --> 08:44.827
What, that little person
with the mouth?

08:44.827 --> 08:47.985
She said she'd second chair
if I needed her.

08:51.086 --> 08:53.487
What are the facts
of this case, anyway?

08:53.487 --> 08:55.161
She came here from Haïti

08:55.161 --> 08:58.084
after being bought as a slave
when she was 7.

08:58.084 --> 08:59.730
She's pregnant with her owner's child.

08:59.730 --> 09:01.896
He said he planned to sell the baby.

09:01.896 --> 09:05.277
They got into an altercation,
and she stabbed him.

09:05.277 --> 09:08.317
Just out of curiosity,
what would be your defense?

09:08.317 --> 09:12.147
Temporary insanity.
She just snapped.

09:14.024 --> 09:16.281
Well, as I said, I am sorry,

09:16.281 --> 09:20.877
but I cannot let you do this
as a member of this firm.

09:29.248 --> 09:31.013
Clarence…

09:34.734 --> 09:38.197
Maybe I could back you up.

09:38.197 --> 09:39.537
Really?

09:40.447 --> 09:43.179
Let me meet with your client.

09:44.013 --> 09:45.444
Thank you.

09:57.188 --> 09:59.575
–Hey.
–Hey.

10:00.397 --> 10:02.012
So…

10:04.085 --> 10:06.461
word is, you're gonna have the baby.

10:06.698 --> 10:08.146
Yeah.

10:08.333 --> 10:10.170
That's fantastic.

10:12.460 --> 10:15.302
You know, when my daughter
was born…

10:16.410 --> 10:19.363
well, it changes everything.

10:20.399 --> 10:23.393
It's a fantastic thing, Denise.

10:24.487 --> 10:27.307
I'm really looking forward to it.

10:28.612 --> 10:31.416
And we are absolutely sure
it's Brad's?

10:31.416 --> 10:33.667
Oh, yes.

10:33.667 --> 10:37.042
Jeffrey, you don't have to worry.
–Okay.

10:37.344 --> 10:38.707
Well, good, good.

10:38.707 --> 10:40.874
Last thing I need right now.

10:45.358 --> 10:47.674
Congratulations again.

10:52.569 --> 10:53.811
Thanks.

10:55.912 --> 10:59.498
My family sold me to the Boitelles
when I was 7 years old.

10:59.498 --> 11:01.481
This was back in Haïti?

11:01.481 --> 11:03.713
Yes, my family had many debts.

11:03.713 --> 11:05.039
So they sold you?

11:05.039 --> 11:08.669
What's with these stupid Haïtians?
They're into slaves?

11:10.575 --> 11:15.257
I'm sure most Haïtians
are nice, law-abiding people.

11:15.257 --> 11:16.995
There. Are we covered?

11:17.764 --> 11:20.067
The family that purchased you,

11:20.067 --> 11:23.281
when they moved to America,
they brought you with them?

11:23.281 --> 11:24.913
I belong to them.

11:24.913 --> 11:27.061
How old are you, Ania?

11:27.061 --> 11:28.333
18.

11:28.333 --> 11:33.138
Did he ever beat you or whip you
or throw you on the ground and kick you?

11:33.138 --> 11:35.684
What? They're legitimate questions.

11:35.684 --> 11:38.212
What happened that night, Ania?

11:38.212 --> 11:42.674
Monsieur Boitelle just said
he was going to sell my child.

11:42.674 --> 11:44.983
What a pig!

11:47.843 --> 11:50.844
And he is the baby's father?

11:50.844 --> 11:52.484
Yes.

11:52.484 --> 11:54.649
I belong to him.

11:55.485 --> 11:57.999
We got a call from the head
of port security.

11:57.999 --> 12:00.751
An officer became concerned
when he had a situation.

12:00.751 --> 12:01.969
Can you tell us what?

12:01.969 --> 12:05.660
They found 50 containers
labeled “Spirit Technologies.”

12:05.660 --> 12:09.135
It didn't look right,
so we opened one up and analyzed it.

12:09.135 --> 12:11.076
And what did you find?

12:11.076 --> 12:14.592
Medical waste being shipped
by Spirit Technologies,

12:14.592 --> 12:17.936
a company traced to the defendant,
to Norway.

12:17.936 --> 12:20.051
That's a foreign country.

12:20.051 --> 12:20.862
Thank you.

12:20.862 --> 12:22.789
We notified the AG's office at once.

12:22.789 --> 12:26.543
They contacted homeland security
and ultimately referred it to your office,

12:26.543 --> 12:29.113
and well, now we're here.

12:29.113 --> 12:30.838
Anybody get sick?

12:30.838 --> 12:31.644
No.

12:31.644 --> 12:33.947
No thanks to the lawlessness
of your client.

12:33.947 --> 12:37.102
These were standard
medical waste containers.

12:37.102 --> 12:41.005
–Yes, but the…
–Sealed in double 3-millimeter bags

12:41.005 --> 12:45.554
and shipped in leak-proof, rigid,
puncture-resistant,

12:45.554 --> 12:48.476
shatter-proof, red containers.

12:48.476 --> 12:51.188
Medical waste, by law,

12:51.188 --> 12:56.552
must be disposed of and rendered
noninfectious by legally mandated methods.

12:56.552 --> 12:58.797
It's certainly not to be sold
like a commodity.

12:58.797 --> 13:00.397
You seem upset.

13:00.397 --> 13:03.863
He committed a crime, your honor,
which put the public at risk.

13:03.863 --> 13:05.541
He committed a terrible crime.

13:05.541 --> 13:07.267
Can I get you to take
a position on that?

13:07.267 --> 13:08.468
All right.

13:08.468 --> 13:11.502
Very funny. Funny man.

13:11.990 --> 13:14.177
He thinks he's a funny man.

13:18.692 --> 13:24.524
Clarence, you will take
the direct examination of Ania.

13:25.755 --> 13:27.678
Can you?

13:27.992 --> 13:29.263
Yes.

13:29.645 --> 13:32.124
And you will conduct the cross
of the victim's wife.

13:32.124 --> 13:34.334
I'll handle the doctors
and do the closing.

13:34.334 --> 13:35.900
Why should you get to close?

13:35.900 --> 13:37.950
You're so old.

13:40.824 --> 13:43.091
Must you always be so unpleasant?

13:43.091 --> 13:44.762
I'm a very nice person.

13:44.762 --> 13:48.062
It just takes a nice person
to bring it out in me.

13:52.522 --> 13:54.117
Shirley, you have a sec?

13:54.117 --> 13:56.334
–Sure.
–I'll make it quick.

13:57.442 --> 14:01.214
I have decided to give you
my letter of resignation.

14:02.025 --> 14:03.528
What? Why?

14:03.528 --> 14:06.252
Well, I want to be
at a smaller firm, so…

14:06.252 --> 14:07.614
What firm?

14:07.614 --> 14:10.583
I don't know yet,
but I'll look and…

14:10.583 --> 14:12.289
What's going on?

14:12.289 --> 14:16.986
You don't resign from someplace
without having another place to go.

14:16.986 --> 14:18.722
I've had enough of it here.

14:18.722 --> 14:20.084
Enough what?

14:20.084 --> 14:22.815
Isolation.
I don't fit in.

14:22.815 --> 14:26.182
I'm done trying,
so I'm moving on.

14:26.182 --> 14:27.601
There must be some precipitating…

14:27.601 --> 14:29.460
There isn't.

14:30.600 --> 14:33.517
I'm not happy here,

14:33.517 --> 14:35.723
so I'm leaving.

14:52.752 --> 14:54.751
I'm going to have to put you on the stand.

14:54.751 --> 14:56.987
That's fine with me.
What do we talk about?

14:56.987 --> 14:58.773
Denny, I'm concerned.

14:58.773 --> 15:03.468
The term “medical waste” has all of these
frightening connotations,

15:03.468 --> 15:09.326
fears of people growing
a third leg or cancer or…

15:09.326 --> 15:11.671
Well, if we spilled it,

15:11.671 --> 15:15.267
chances are, we spilled it in Norway,
so who cares?

15:15.267 --> 15:17.726
It all has a reckless feel to it.

15:17.726 --> 15:20.582
Denny, you have to be
very careful up there.

15:20.582 --> 15:24.178
You must be reasonable
and judicious, reserved,

15:24.178 --> 15:25.900
all the things you're not.

15:25.900 --> 15:28.136
I'm gonna tell you something

15:28.136 --> 15:29.817
you don't know about me.
–Oh, boy.

15:29.817 --> 15:34.837
I'm a master,
an absolute master of…

15:35.473 --> 15:36.892
It'll come to you.

15:36.892 --> 15:39.472
Emotion.
Trials don't turn on facts.

15:39.472 --> 15:42.231
It always comes down to emotion.

15:42.231 --> 15:45.015
I'll have that jury
eating out of my lap.

15:45.015 --> 15:47.858
–Hand.
–I'll be riveting.

15:47.858 --> 15:50.175
They will cry for me, Alan.

15:50.175 --> 15:53.867
When I tell them my story,
they will cry for me.

15:53.867 --> 15:56.196
Why? What's your story?

15:56.196 --> 15:57.995
You ask the questions.

15:57.995 --> 16:01.882
I will answer them from deep in here.

16:13.886 --> 16:16.901
How can you just abandon me?

16:16.901 --> 16:18.156
I'm not abandoning you.

16:18.156 --> 16:19.489
You brought me here, Jeffrey.

16:19.489 --> 16:22.690
And you love it.
I've never seen you so happy.

16:22.690 --> 16:25.260
Well, you can't just leave.

16:25.825 --> 16:27.294
Just heard.

16:27.609 --> 16:29.440
Yeah, I'm sure you're crushed.

16:29.440 --> 16:31.167
I'm disappointed, actually.

16:31.167 --> 16:33.622
Despite our differences,
you were beginning to grow on me.

16:33.622 --> 16:35.425
Yeah, like a wart.

16:35.425 --> 16:37.816
Look, I don't mean to be presumptuous

16:37.816 --> 16:39.793
enough to think I had
anything to do with your decision,

16:39.793 --> 16:42.288
but if I did, I'm sorry.

16:42.511 --> 16:43.848
It's not you, Brad.

16:43.848 --> 16:45.468
Is it me?

16:50.304 --> 16:52.292
Yes.

17:09.263 --> 17:11.063
So…

17:11.916 --> 17:16.001
if the baby was yours,
you, you would have stayed?

17:16.001 --> 17:17.539
I don't know.

17:17.539 --> 17:22.595
Maybe this is the final
humiliation before…

17:23.054 --> 17:24.037
I will tell you this,

17:24.037 --> 17:26.558
I don't believe in that
“friends with benefits” thing.

17:26.558 --> 17:29.517
If someone can make love
to a person and not feel,

17:29.517 --> 17:31.964
there's something wrong with him.

17:32.967 --> 17:34.997
Or her.

17:40.961 --> 17:46.513
Would you please describe for the court
your living conditions at the Boitelles?

17:46.513 --> 17:49.091
I had a room, a bed.

17:49.091 --> 17:54.145
Would you please describe for the court
how Mr Boitelle treated you?

17:54.145 --> 17:57.732
He treated me like restavek.

17:57.732 --> 18:01.993
Would you please describe
for the court what a restavek is?

18:01.993 --> 18:05.105
It means “slave.”

18:05.105 --> 18:09.799
Would you please describe for the court
what it meant to be a slave?

18:09.799 --> 18:12.898
Counsel, are you going to
lead off every question

18:12.898 --> 18:15.734
with “would you please describe”?

18:17.507 --> 18:18.983
What the hell?

18:23.753 --> 18:26.469
Are you not feeling well?

18:29.742 --> 18:33.371
We don't have all day, Mr Bell.

18:46.420 --> 18:51.094
Was sex involved in your servitude, Ania?

18:51.094 --> 18:52.115
Yes.

18:52.115 --> 18:55.971
Did you ever initiate
sex with Mr Boitelle?

18:55.971 --> 18:56.778
No.

18:56.778 --> 19:03.635
What would have happened to you
if you declined sex with Mr Boitelle?

19:04.351 --> 19:08.477
You can't even imagine
doing that, can you?

19:08.477 --> 19:10.023
No.

19:10.848 --> 19:12.580
Why didn't you run away?

19:12.580 --> 19:15.080
The police would just bring me back.

19:15.080 --> 19:17.604
Then I would be beaten.

19:17.604 --> 19:20.634
Plus, I had no place to go.

19:20.936 --> 19:22.594
The night…

19:23.387 --> 19:27.242
you took Mr Boitelle's life,

19:27.242 --> 19:29.476
can you tell us what happened?

19:29.476 --> 19:34.184
My baby, he told me
they were going to sell him.

19:34.184 --> 19:36.763
I argued, and he hits me.

19:36.763 --> 19:38.309
I protested more!

19:38.309 --> 19:40.493
I was not going to let him!

19:40.493 --> 19:42.741
And he hit me again.

19:42.741 --> 19:45.852
I took up a kitchen knife,

19:45.852 --> 19:52.438
and he made a move
to either hit me again or…

19:52.438 --> 19:56.053
and I pushed with the knife and…

19:56.053 --> 19:58.573
and he fell.

19:59.474 --> 20:03.053
I didn't mean to kill him.

20:03.617 --> 20:06.821
He just fell.

20:10.577 --> 20:12.764
I thought she held up on cross.

20:12.764 --> 20:15.831
Okay, Bethany, you'll take
the cross on the wife.

20:15.831 --> 20:17.209
We already covered that.

20:17.209 --> 20:19.369
You think I have the memory of a guppy?

20:19.369 --> 20:22.851
I'll take the doctors.
Then we'll see where we are.

20:23.032 --> 20:24.789
–Clarence?
–Yes?

20:24.789 --> 20:27.513
I think you did an excellent job.

20:27.513 --> 20:30.081
Really? –You got in everything
you needed to.

20:30.081 --> 20:31.596
You were great.

20:34.979 --> 20:38.313
So you want to remind me again
that I'm crossing the wife?

20:38.313 --> 20:39.930
Oh, shut up.

20:46.728 --> 20:49.395
There comes a point when a man
wants to make a difference.

20:49.395 --> 20:52.209
And your particular difference would be?

20:52.209 --> 20:53.239
Fat.

20:53.239 --> 20:55.408
Did you just say “fat”?

20:55.408 --> 20:56.462
Well, think about it.

20:56.462 --> 20:58.996
We're the most obese country
in the world.

20:58.996 --> 21:01.410
Look around you.
Him, her.

21:01.410 --> 21:03.631
You could lose a few.
–Denny…

21:03.631 --> 21:06.732
And I thought, why blame
fast foods and the like?

21:06.732 --> 21:10.081
Wouldn't it be better
if we put it all to good use?

21:10.081 --> 21:11.821
Mr Crane, if I may,

21:11.821 --> 21:14.361
how did you first come up
with this idea?

21:14.361 --> 21:16.138
Well, first off, I didn't.

21:16.138 --> 21:17.812
There's a hospital in Miami

21:17.812 --> 21:22.698
that already ships its fat
off to Norway for fuel conversion.

21:22.698 --> 21:25.350
But what motivated you?

21:26.046 --> 21:27.778
Honestly?

21:31.418 --> 21:33.552
My uncle Bill.

21:35.633 --> 21:37.673
–Uncle Bill?
–Yeah.

21:37.673 --> 21:40.086
He used to take me around with him

21:40.086 --> 21:42.444
everywhere he went when I was a kid.

21:42.444 --> 21:45.208
He was larger than life.
I mean, truly. He was…

21:45.208 --> 21:47.878
he tipped the scales at 300,

21:47.878 --> 21:53.491
but he was so full of love
and, yes, joy.

21:53.491 --> 21:56.537
We've all got that uncle, haven't we?

21:59.404 --> 22:02.073
Well, he got diabetes,

22:02.073 --> 22:03.633
and it killed him.

22:03.633 --> 22:07.180
And I remember sitting
beside his hospital bed…

22:07.180 --> 22:08.590
it was towards the end,

22:08.590 --> 22:14.920
and I commented on how much
I admired him for his love of life,

22:14.920 --> 22:18.350
and he started to cry a little.

22:18.350 --> 22:19.942
Why?

22:20.118 --> 22:22.240
He said, “to love life
is to love others,”

22:22.240 --> 22:25.019
“and, uh, if you really want
to share that love,”

22:25.019 --> 22:27.759
“you've got to give something back.”
And…

22:27.759 --> 22:31.620
and he felt he hadn't.
He felt broken,

22:31.620 --> 22:36.780
and he was gonna die,
and he hadn't…

22:37.008 --> 22:38.858
So ever since,

22:38.858 --> 22:41.951
I've been trying to 
come up with some way

22:41.951 --> 22:45.916
to make uncle Bill's life matter.

22:45.916 --> 22:48.559
And that's when I started the business.

22:48.559 --> 22:50.993
Our motto is “what if?”

22:50.993 --> 22:52.011
And we did it.

22:52.011 --> 22:55.181
And there's actually 132 people
who come to work every day with the idea

22:55.181 --> 22:57.587
they're gonna save the planet.

22:58.795 --> 23:00.379
Wow.

23:00.594 --> 23:03.114
That's, that's something.

23:03.366 --> 23:07.487
And for me, privately,

23:07.668 --> 23:13.424
I suppose it's not a matter
of saving the planet

23:13.424 --> 23:16.206
so much as it is….

23:17.588 --> 23:20.840
giving back…

23:20.840 --> 23:23.652
to somebody…

23:23.830 --> 23:28.777
I so loved and still miss.

23:30.301 --> 23:32.773
My uncle Bill.

23:51.440 --> 23:55.393
I walked in to find Ania
standing over my husband with a knife.

23:55.393 --> 23:56.917
He was dead.

23:56.917 --> 23:59.701
Can you think of any reason
why Ania would kill him?

23:59.701 --> 24:01.872
No, she was our housekeeper.

24:01.872 --> 24:03.999
We looked after her.
We loved her.

24:03.999 --> 24:06.364
I can't possibly understand this.

24:06.364 --> 24:09.403
And to your knowledge,
did the defendant have any reason

24:09.403 --> 24:11.689
to feel her life was threatened
by you or your husband?

24:11.689 --> 24:13.187
Absolutely not.

24:13.187 --> 24:16.187
She knows we love her like family.

24:16.870 --> 24:19.169
You know it, Ania.

24:19.719 --> 24:24.025
How much does a 7-year-old girl
cost these days in Haiti?

24:24.025 --> 24:26.488
Ania's family solicited the arrangement.

24:26.488 --> 24:28.492
Our customs are different in my country.

24:28.492 --> 24:32.391
So this member of your family
was your 8-year-old housekeeper?

24:32.391 --> 24:34.899
We brought her out of the streets
and gave her a life.

24:34.899 --> 24:36.319
A life?

24:36.319 --> 24:38.203
What school did Ania attend?

24:38.203 --> 24:41.023
–We home-schooled her.
–Did she have any friends?

24:41.023 --> 24:43.182
Because we couldn't find
a record of any children

24:43.182 --> 24:45.723
who claim to have ever seen her
or played with her,

24:45.723 --> 24:47.774
not even on your own block.

24:47.774 --> 24:49.183
In Haïti,

24:49.183 --> 24:51.976
nearly half of all children die
before the age of 5.

24:51.976 --> 24:53.491
Move to strike.
Relevance.

24:53.491 --> 24:55.606
No, that's relevant.

24:55.606 --> 24:58.443
Half die before the age of 5.

24:58.443 --> 25:01.191
How dare you say that's not relevant?

25:01.191 --> 25:03.922
Ania lived with no running water,

25:03.922 --> 25:05.885
shared a mattress
with three other children,

25:05.885 --> 25:09.635
was riddled with lice,
sometimes went days without food.

25:09.635 --> 25:13.318
Did you plan to sell Ania's baby?

25:13.318 --> 25:15.474
We would never sell a child.

25:15.474 --> 25:17.648
Right, you only buy them.

25:17.648 --> 25:18.475
Objection.

25:18.475 --> 25:21.660
My husband didn't deserve this.

25:23.915 --> 25:25.859
He loved you, Ania.

25:27.755 --> 25:29.590
He loved you.

25:38.890 --> 25:41.190
The law is the law.

25:41.190 --> 25:43.683
Human waste must be disposed of.

25:43.683 --> 25:46.852
It is not to be sold.

25:46.852 --> 25:50.979
The fact that there may be a hospital
in Miami also peddling human fat

25:50.979 --> 25:54.335
is neither persuasive nor relevant.

25:54.335 --> 25:59.623
That man put our community at risk
for hundreds of communicable diseases.

25:59.623 --> 26:02.347
This was not just a harmless violation.

26:02.347 --> 26:08.125
He risked my safety, yours,
your children's.

26:08.933 --> 26:12.961
The law is the law.

26:18.050 --> 26:21.660
How come the other side
always has short closings?

26:25.309 --> 26:29.572
The law doesn't expressly cover
the sale of medical waste,

26:29.572 --> 26:32.109
because the lawmakers
never considered the idea.

26:32.109 --> 26:36.398
Lawmakers tend to see only
what is and then legislate it.

26:36.398 --> 26:37.363
And truth be told,

26:37.363 --> 26:40.774
I'd never heard of human fat
being turned into fuel before.

26:40.774 --> 26:42.471
Had any of you?
–Uh, objection.

26:42.471 --> 26:45.918
Counsel is seeking to establish
a dialogue with the jury.

26:45.918 --> 26:47.929
It's inappropriate.

26:54.197 --> 26:56.995
Turns out, we've got all kinds
of viable fuel alternatives

26:56.995 --> 26:58.541
that we don't really bother to explore.

26:58.541 --> 27:02.753
Biodiesel can be manufactured
from vegetable oil, animal fats,

27:02.753 --> 27:05.029
even recycled restaurant grease.

27:05.029 --> 27:08.280
Ethanol, I had heard of that one,
is an alcohol-based fuel.

27:08.280 --> 27:10.630
Why aren't we aggressively
developing that one?

27:10.630 --> 27:12.235
Uh, hydrogen, that's coming,

27:12.235 --> 27:14.037
but we don't seem to be in a rush.

27:14.037 --> 27:16.248
Methanol is a wood alcohol.

27:16.248 --> 27:17.895
And then, of course,
there's electricity,

27:17.895 --> 27:20.667
which we don't use
simply because…

27:21.504 --> 27:23.713
I've forgotten.

27:23.713 --> 27:26.092
Why don't we have electric cars?

27:26.092 --> 27:28.725
Did we get rid of them
because they're the most efficient?

27:28.725 --> 27:32.078
I bet it was because those who actually
drove them claim to love them.

27:32.078 --> 27:33.794
Objection.
He's drifting off point.

27:33.794 --> 27:36.531
It's inappropriate.

27:42.534 --> 27:44.068
And then there's oil.

27:44.068 --> 27:49.685
We ignore all those other cleaner-burning
fuel alternatives for oil.

27:49.685 --> 27:51.531
And sure, it's not so efficient,

27:51.531 --> 27:52.912
it's expensive,
it pollutes the air,

27:52.912 --> 27:54.514
but it gets presidents elected.

27:54.514 --> 27:56.678
And after all, this is
the United States of America.

27:56.678 --> 27:57.760
We love oil.

27:57.760 --> 27:59.943
We do charity work in
the Middle East 'cause of it.

27:59.943 --> 28:02.012
We're oil people.
–Mr Shore…

28:02.012 --> 28:04.041
–Yes, judge?
–This case, please.

28:04.041 --> 28:09.612
Yes, this case is about a man searching for
an alternative to fossil fuels.

28:09.612 --> 28:12.099
Not to put your children
and grandchildren at risk,

28:12.099 --> 28:13.539
but perhaps to save them.

28:13.539 --> 28:15.558
The world is dying, folks.

28:15.558 --> 28:16.925
Global warming is real,

28:16.925 --> 28:19.899
and what's even more real
is that Americans are fat.

28:19.899 --> 28:21.013
And because we're fat,

28:21.013 --> 28:24.358
we're burning billions of gallons of
gasoline carting ourselves around.

28:24.358 --> 28:25.397
We love fat.

28:25.397 --> 28:27.348
It leads to more profits
for the oil companies,

28:27.348 --> 28:30.425
and as oil people, we're—
–Mr Shore…

28:30.425 --> 28:33.719
How about instead,
we harvest the fat?

28:33.719 --> 28:35.458
We already are,
if you think about it.

28:35.458 --> 28:39.185
We have about a half-million
liposuctions a year in this country.

28:39.185 --> 28:41.757
That's now,
without the philanthropic bonus.

28:41.757 --> 28:44.178
You can imagine how
that number would surge

28:44.178 --> 28:46.883
if we could not only
look thinner with the procedure,

28:46.883 --> 28:48.728
but could also power our SUV's.

28:48.728 --> 28:51.082
This man decided to try.

28:51.082 --> 28:53.719
He said to himself, “what if?”

28:53.719 --> 28:55.872
He founded a company on the idea,

28:55.872 --> 29:00.818
to save the planet,
to save you and you.

29:00.818 --> 29:03.661
Maybe you, but he wants
to throw him in jail,

29:03.661 --> 29:07.858
because the lawmakers lack the imagination
to see hope in the future of medical waste.

29:07.858 --> 29:09.244
Throw this man in jail.

29:09.244 --> 29:11.510
He seems to do all his thinking
inside a square box.

29:11.510 --> 29:13.458
Put him in a cell.
–Inappropriate.

29:13.458 --> 29:15.702
When do we all wake up?

29:15.702 --> 29:17.877
The ice caps are melting.

29:17.877 --> 29:19.736
The polar bears are dying.

29:19.736 --> 29:21.728
Planet Earth is in trouble,

29:21.728 --> 29:24.851
and we still burn oil
like there's no tomorrow,

29:24.851 --> 29:27.159
which might be a self-fulfilling prophecy.

29:27.159 --> 29:31.071
Denny Crane tried to make a difference
by doing something

29:31.071 --> 29:32.742
for you,

29:32.742 --> 29:34.074
for you,

29:34.074 --> 29:35.010
for me,

29:35.010 --> 29:36.908
for him, of all people.

29:36.908 --> 29:41.150
And, yes, most of all…

29:42.723 --> 29:45.273
for uncle Bill.

29:58.266 --> 29:59.686
Too much?

30:14.346 --> 30:17.545
Go ahead, laugh away.

30:17.745 --> 30:18.872
I won't laugh.

30:18.872 --> 30:20.752
It's something I do on occasion

30:20.752 --> 30:24.874
when I have low blood sugar
or I have to…

30:25.100 --> 30:28.858
I throw it on,
and it makes me feel really good,

30:29.171 --> 30:32.246
as stupid as that sounds and is.

30:32.507 --> 30:34.353
Now I can't get it off.

30:34.888 --> 30:37.049
What do you mean,
you can't get it off?

30:37.049 --> 30:39.772
I must have damaged it
in the fight with Brad.

30:39.772 --> 30:41.705
A buckle snapped off when I…

30:41.705 --> 30:43.928
now I'm gonna have to get
cut out of it, I think.

30:43.928 --> 30:45.759
Let me see.

30:52.431 --> 30:54.508
You, you are stuck.

30:54.508 --> 30:55.685
So if you don't mind,

30:55.685 --> 30:59.253
I'm just gonna hang out
in my office until after hours,

30:59.253 --> 31:03.401
so the last image people have
of me in this place isn't…

31:09.758 --> 31:12.910
Jeffrey, clearly,
you're not happy here,

31:12.910 --> 31:18.254
but for the record,
while people may not adore you,

31:18.254 --> 31:21.196
they very much like you.

31:25.695 --> 31:31.659
Maybe I don't like myself
in this fast-paced…

31:33.861 --> 31:39.241
perhaps the reason
I was hoping it was my baby…

31:39.574 --> 31:42.497
was the idea that I could somehow

31:42.497 --> 31:44.871
get the time back that
I missed with my daughter

31:44.871 --> 31:47.912
'cause I was so busy.

31:51.197 --> 31:53.034
Anyway.

31:53.768 --> 31:57.406
Thank you, Shirley, for everything.

32:00.381 --> 32:02.480
And I do mean that.

32:07.238 --> 32:11.566
Don't hole up here till after hours.

32:11.566 --> 32:13.678
Leave with your head high.

32:13.678 --> 32:15.687
As Buzz Lightyear?

32:16.536 --> 32:19.960
To infinity and beyond.

32:29.488 --> 32:32.001
Being held that long in captivity,

32:32.001 --> 32:35.493
it's almost impossible to
determine her true mental state.

32:35.493 --> 32:38.807
But certainly, brainwashing
had to take place.

32:38.807 --> 32:40.321
She understood her actions.

32:40.321 --> 32:41.243
Was she angry?

32:41.243 --> 32:43.458
Yes. Outraged, I'm sure.

32:43.458 --> 32:45.502
But she wasn't insane, in my opinion.

32:45.502 --> 32:46.661
Yes, she was.

32:46.661 --> 32:48.111
No, she wasn't.

32:48.111 --> 32:48.840
She was.

32:48.840 --> 32:50.084
–Not.
–Too!

32:50.084 --> 32:51.564
–Not.
–Too!

32:51.564 --> 32:52.874
Not.

32:52.874 --> 32:56.360
Well, I'd say we got the edge
in medical testimony,

32:56.360 --> 32:58.516
but it was mainly a wash.

32:58.516 --> 33:00.418
I'm concerned about your closing.

33:00.418 --> 33:02.116
You don't pop.

33:03.697 --> 33:07.000
Clarence, how would you feel
about closing?

33:07.218 --> 33:09.557
–Me?
–You were extremely sympathetic.

33:09.557 --> 33:11.280
Not all of us were.

33:11.280 --> 33:14.654
I think the jury liked you,
and more importantly, they trusted you.

33:14.654 --> 33:15.803
The summation?

33:15.803 --> 33:17.592
You don't need to orate.

33:17.592 --> 33:19.144
Just talk to them.

33:19.144 --> 33:20.604
I…

33:21.491 --> 33:23.568
I, I, I don't know.

33:23.568 --> 33:26.340
You can do it, Clarence,
and you need to.

33:26.340 --> 33:28.388
He doesn't pop.

33:37.596 --> 33:40.198
–Try to take deep breaths.
–Why?

33:40.198 --> 33:42.406
Denny, have you considered
that we may lose?

33:42.406 --> 33:44.219
Yes, but I didn't try this case.

33:44.219 --> 33:46.373
So even if we lose,
I'm still undefeated.

33:46.373 --> 33:48.298
The idea of jail doesn't bother you?

33:48.298 --> 33:51.249
Listen, my friend, there's only
one thing I can't do without, sex.

33:51.249 --> 33:54.088
A lot of sex takes place in prison.

33:54.088 --> 33:56.240
Do you know what kind of sex?

33:56.240 --> 33:58.165
Has the jury reached a verdict?

33:58.165 --> 33:59.364
We have, your honor.

33:59.364 --> 34:00.891
What say you?

34:00.891 --> 34:03.906
“In the matter of the Commonwealth
vs Denny Crane”

34:03.906 --> 34:10.034
“on the charge of violation of Massachusetts
general law chapter 105, section 480,”

34:10.034 --> 34:13.608
“we find the defendant Denny Crane.”

34:15.072 --> 34:17.135
Oh, uh, not guilty.

34:17.135 --> 34:19.045
–Damn right.
–Very well.

34:19.045 --> 34:20.197
Scotch!

34:20.197 --> 34:21.364
You're buying.

34:21.364 --> 34:24.283
Oh, you're celebrating real classy.

34:24.283 --> 34:26.841
Oh, look. It's the L.T. Pout.

34:26.841 --> 34:29.085
Blame it on our head coach, sport.

34:35.636 --> 34:40.179
There was no deadly threat
of any kind to justify self-defense.

34:40.179 --> 34:43.373
There was no medical evidence
to support insanity.

34:43.373 --> 34:44.998
She just got mad.

34:44.998 --> 34:48.110
She had enough,
and she acted out.

34:48.110 --> 34:49.762
That's murder.

34:49.762 --> 34:53.099
As for this captivity and brainwashing,

34:53.099 --> 34:55.435
she had years to walk out the door.

34:55.435 --> 34:57.843
She could have just called the police.

34:57.843 --> 35:02.088
Even if you believe everything
the defendant has told you,

35:02.088 --> 35:03.490
it's murder.

35:03.490 --> 35:07.808
She picked up a knife,
and she stabbed a man.

35:07.808 --> 35:09.712
That's murder.

35:28.823 --> 35:34.830
My client was born
into a culture of slavery,

35:34.830 --> 35:40.442
where restaveks did not have
the free will to resist their owners.

35:40.442 --> 35:44.230
She was brought to the United States
at the age of 7.

35:44.230 --> 35:48.110
She lived her life in servitude.

35:48.110 --> 35:53.823
Slave trafficking around the world
yields about $9 billion a year.

35:53.823 --> 35:57.572
In Haïti, it's a way of life,

35:57.572 --> 36:02.329
so much so that when girls like Ania
are sold as children,

36:02.329 --> 36:04.002
they simply accept it.

36:04.002 --> 36:10.229
Whatever Mr Boitelle wanted,
labor, sex…

36:10.229 --> 36:13.660
it was her duty to provide it.

36:13.660 --> 36:19.863
But when he threatened to take her baby,

36:20.364 --> 36:22.800
she snapped.

36:23.549 --> 36:27.081
The district attorney says
Ania wasn't insane that night.

36:27.081 --> 36:28.653
How could she know?

36:28.653 --> 36:32.636
How could any of us imagine?

36:33.713 --> 36:39.839
If somebody wanted to sell your baby,

36:39.839 --> 36:44.699
told you he would sell it
as he beat you,

36:45.424 --> 36:47.904
you sure you wouldn't snap?

36:49.465 --> 36:51.415
You sure?

37:15.348 --> 37:18.398
It's stuck on.
Don't laugh.

37:18.398 --> 37:19.749
Okay.

37:36.317 --> 37:37.799
Well…

37:38.006 --> 37:39.210
Are you leaving Boston?

37:39.210 --> 37:42.242
Oh, no, no, no, no.
It turns out I, I like Boston,

37:42.242 --> 37:43.674
so who knows?

37:43.674 --> 37:46.512
We'll probably meet
across the table someday.

37:46.512 --> 37:48.597
I'm looking forward to it.

37:58.107 --> 38:00.387
Good luck with the pregnancy, Denise.

38:00.387 --> 38:02.620
I wish you nothing but happiness.

38:02.620 --> 38:04.365
Thank you.

38:07.228 --> 38:09.023
Don't be a stranger.

38:09.023 --> 38:10.866
I won't.

38:17.328 --> 38:20.581
I'm gonna miss you
most of all, scarecrow.

38:30.123 --> 38:31.750
Well…

38:37.664 --> 38:39.424
To infinity.

38:39.650 --> 38:41.522

Madam Foreperson, you will
announce your verdict for the court.

39:26.451 --> 39:30.165
“In the matter of the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts vs Ania Gadios”

39:30.165 --> 39:32.893
“on the charge of murder
in the first degree,”

39:32.893 --> 39:34.741

39:41.559 --> 39:42.943
I thank you for your service.

39:42.943 --> 39:44.513
Please return to the jury room.

This case is adjourned.

39:49.667 --> 39:51.404
Thank you all so much.

39:51.404 --> 39:53.048
Good luck, Ania.

39:56.581 --> 39:58.769
He loved you.

39:59.070 --> 40:01.912
He never would have hurt you.

40:02.169 --> 40:04.945
I'm sorry, Mrs Boitelle.

40:06.408 --> 40:10.476
Well, you have your freedom.

40:11.494 --> 40:12.555
Good-bye.

40:12.555 --> 40:15.089
I'm your restavek.

40:15.526 --> 40:18.063
Not anymore.

40:22.790 --> 40:24.693
What do I do now?

40:24.693 --> 40:27.207
You're free, Ania.

40:27.207 --> 40:29.696
I'm her restavek.

40:40.672 --> 40:44.836
You know, I'm growing
rather fond of being arrested.

40:44.836 --> 40:47.614
It's nice to be the center of things.

40:47.614 --> 40:51.504
Alan, thank you for everything.

40:52.108 --> 40:55.401
I'm sure your closing was brilliant.

40:55.401 --> 40:57.843
–You didn't listen?
–In and out.

40:57.843 --> 41:00.200
They're just so long.

41:04.122 --> 41:06.960
Do you even have an uncle Bill?

41:07.935 --> 41:09.490
I didn't think so.

41:09.490 --> 41:11.256
Had an auntie Billie.

41:11.477 --> 41:13.423
We used to call her “Bill” sometimes.

41:13.423 --> 41:15.227
Harelip.

41:15.748 --> 41:18.611
Did you have that little story planned,
or did you just wing it?

41:18.611 --> 41:20.283
Planned, planned?

41:20.283 --> 41:22.303
You don't plan sincerity.

41:22.303 --> 41:24.949
You gotta make it up on the spot.

41:29.138 --> 41:32.860
Why do you think we're so recalcitrant 
when it comes to…

41:32.860 --> 41:35.134
exploring new sources of energy?

41:35.134 --> 41:38.111
You think the oil companies
sabotage our progress there?

41:38.111 --> 41:39.115
No.

41:39.115 --> 41:41.283
You think they killed the electric car?

41:41.283 --> 41:42.138
No.

41:42.138 --> 41:45.026
You think there's any real hope
for us against global warming?

41:45.026 --> 41:46.557
You want hope?

41:47.768 --> 41:49.559
Right here, my friend.

41:49.559 --> 41:52.447
I see a glimmer or two right there.

41:53.069 --> 41:55.961
Maybe we should have
a big steak tonight.

41:55.961 --> 41:57.141
Potatoes…

41:57.141 --> 41:58.836
we need to do what we can.

41:58.836 --> 42:00.808
A little baked Alaska for dessert.

42:00.808 --> 42:02.392
Because we care.

42:02.392 --> 42:03.566
To us.

42:03.566 --> 42:04.752
Visionaries.

42:04.752 --> 42:06.330
Pioneers.

42:06.521 --> 42:07.982
Fat.

42:08.305 --> 42:14.600
