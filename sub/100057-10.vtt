00:01.202 --> 00:04.872
- * Oh, I can't get home fast
enough, Santa Claus *

00:04.905 --> 00:06.507
- I thought you weren't
allowed to do electrical work.

00:06.540 --> 00:08.242
- Oh, no, I'm not allowed to
legally call myself

00:08.276 --> 00:11.145
an electrician,
but in my own home,

00:11.179 --> 00:13.181
I can do as much
subpar work as I want.

00:13.214 --> 00:15.816
[car horn honking]

00:15.849 --> 00:18.486
- He'll be right there!

00:18.519 --> 00:20.154
Hold your horses, Susan!

00:20.188 --> 00:21.889
I'm making freakin'
family memories here!

00:21.922 --> 00:23.357
- Mom.
- Sorry.

00:23.391 --> 00:25.259
Susan's just a little,
you know...

00:25.293 --> 00:26.860
Have a great time at practice.

00:26.894 --> 00:30.364
I love you!
- Love you, too.

00:30.398 --> 00:31.999
- So I think we need
to talk

00:32.032 --> 00:33.701
about what happened
on Thanksgiving.

00:33.734 --> 00:36.170
- You mean the sex thing?
I blame the tryptophan.

00:36.204 --> 00:39.107
It probably gave me that
cute-sleepy-koala-bear look.

00:39.140 --> 00:41.242
- It did.

00:41.275 --> 00:43.611
But we cannot do it
again, okay?

00:43.644 --> 00:45.513
I don't want things
to get muddled for Cash.

00:45.546 --> 00:47.215
Or for me.
- Agreed.

00:47.248 --> 00:49.717
Won't happen again.

00:49.750 --> 00:51.219
- [exhales deeply]

00:51.252 --> 00:53.921
Okay, if we're gonna do this,

00:53.954 --> 00:56.390
it has to be just
a holiday fling, okay?

00:56.424 --> 00:58.126
It'll all be done
by New Year's.

00:58.159 --> 01:00.461
And before you ask,
American New Year's,

01:00.494 --> 01:02.196
not Chinese.

01:02.230 --> 01:06.867
Oh, and we have to keep it
casual, so no strings.

01:06.900 --> 01:08.436
Do you think you can do that?

01:08.469 --> 01:11.472
- Am I okay with just having
sex and not doing any other

01:11.505 --> 01:13.274
relationship stuff
I'm terrible at?

01:13.307 --> 01:14.708
- Mm-hmm.
- [laughs]

01:14.742 --> 01:17.445
Hell, yeah.
- [giggles]

01:17.478 --> 01:20.448
[gasps] Oh, fudge, we're gonna
be late for choir practice!

01:20.481 --> 01:22.950
Oh, and remember,
nobody can know about this.

01:24.518 --> 01:26.454
- Mornin'.
- Mornin'.

01:26.487 --> 01:28.389
- Hey, Jenny, you beat me here.
- What?

01:28.422 --> 01:29.990
No, I didn't.
Wait, of course I did.

01:30.023 --> 01:31.159
Wait, what?
- What?

01:31.192 --> 01:32.626
- Huh?
- Yeah.

01:32.660 --> 01:34.094
- Okay, everybody, um--

01:34.128 --> 01:36.664
["Jingle Bells" playing]
Wow.

01:36.697 --> 01:39.967
We have this, but we don't have
a lock on the bathroom door?

01:40.000 --> 01:42.636
- Oh, what a shock, Arthur is
the Grinch who hates Christmas.

01:42.670 --> 01:44.605
- Such a shame, 'cause
you look just like Santa.

01:44.638 --> 01:46.274
- No, I love Christmas.

01:46.307 --> 01:47.841
I used to conduct
a sold-out Christmas concert

01:47.875 --> 01:49.310
every year at Princeton.

01:49.343 --> 01:50.978
- Oh, is that where
you used to work?

01:51.011 --> 01:52.680
I almost forgot.
- Yeah, Princeton.

01:52.713 --> 01:54.014
- Mm-hmm.
- Quick!

01:54.047 --> 01:55.649
Help me take this down.

01:55.683 --> 01:57.084
- Okay, now we have
to take it down.

01:57.117 --> 01:58.986
Can we trade it in for
a lock on the bathroom door?

01:59.019 --> 02:00.288
- I just found out my parents
are in town,

02:00.321 --> 02:01.855
and they're headed here.

02:01.889 --> 02:03.291
- The idea
of you having parents

02:03.324 --> 02:04.358
is somehow disorienting.

02:04.392 --> 02:05.359
- They're world-famous.

02:05.393 --> 02:06.827
- His parents are missionaries,

02:06.860 --> 02:08.996
and when it comes to religion,
they're...

02:09.029 --> 02:10.264
What's the right way
to say it?

02:10.298 --> 02:12.533
- Strict.
- Puritanical.

02:12.566 --> 02:14.435
- Can we not say white?
- You can't.

02:14.468 --> 02:16.170
- My parents
are wonderful people,

02:16.204 --> 02:18.272
but they live
by 1 John 2:15--

02:18.306 --> 02:20.874
"Do not love this world
or the things it offers you."

02:20.908 --> 02:22.943
I'm sorry, Santa--
I love everything about you,

02:22.976 --> 02:24.812
but my parents can't see
my secular side.

02:24.845 --> 02:26.547
I can't handle the judgment.

02:26.580 --> 02:27.948
- Well, they're the ones

02:27.981 --> 02:29.817
that should be worried
about judgment.

02:29.850 --> 02:32.620
Missionaries have no business
coming into populations

02:32.653 --> 02:35.623
and imposing their
supposedly superior values.

02:35.656 --> 02:37.491
- You mean like you do to us
with music.

02:37.525 --> 02:39.126
- Nah, that's different.
I have taste. You don't.

02:39.159 --> 02:40.728
- Taste this.

02:40.761 --> 02:42.530
- Arthur, I've never kicked
anyone out of this church,

02:42.563 --> 02:44.164
but I think it would be best
if you go home for a while

02:44.198 --> 02:45.733
and don't come back.

02:45.766 --> 02:48.502
- Well, you can tell your
imperialist missionary parents

02:48.536 --> 02:50.904
that they can spread the good
word up my--

02:50.938 --> 02:52.573
- Jax.
- Hello, son.

02:52.606 --> 02:54.141
- Ass.
I was gonna say "ass."

02:54.174 --> 02:56.043
- Mom, Dad!

02:56.076 --> 02:58.546
It's such a blessing
you're here.

02:58.579 --> 03:01.849
One that was sprung on me with
no time for mental preparation.

03:01.882 --> 03:04.418
- Sorry for the short notice,
but we thought it might be nice

03:04.452 --> 03:06.687
for you to spend some time
with your sister.

03:06.720 --> 03:08.256
- Which one?

03:08.289 --> 03:09.557
Not Graciela.
She's finishing up med school.

03:09.590 --> 03:11.091
Not Mishki.
She's on her honeymoon.

03:11.124 --> 03:12.526
Wei-Lin?

03:12.560 --> 03:15.095
- No, you have a new sister.

03:15.128 --> 03:17.898
Anjali.

03:17.931 --> 03:20.901
- [muttering]

03:20.934 --> 03:22.603
- Wow.

03:22.636 --> 03:25.539
Your parents definitely
have a type.

03:25.573 --> 03:28.342
- * Hallelujah,
Thine the glory *

03:28.376 --> 03:33.947
* Revive us again

03:33.981 --> 03:37.117
- We found Anjali
in the same orphanage

03:37.150 --> 03:40.254
where we found you, Jax,
and just like then,

03:40.288 --> 03:43.056
we fell in love and had to
bring her into our family.

03:43.090 --> 03:44.292
[chuckles]

03:44.325 --> 03:46.360
- Can I read my Bible
in the car?

03:46.394 --> 03:49.263
- Just crack the windows
so the Holy Ghost can get in.

03:49.297 --> 03:51.732
What a shy one.
- [chuckles] Aw.

03:51.765 --> 03:55.436
Your church is so...

03:55.469 --> 03:57.070
cozy.

03:57.104 --> 03:58.572
- Well, you're seeing it empty.

03:58.606 --> 04:00.474
I wish you could see it
at a service.

04:00.508 --> 04:02.310
It's so full...

04:02.343 --> 04:04.111
of people...
- Mm...

04:04.144 --> 04:06.213
- Because I'm a good minister.

04:06.246 --> 04:07.915
- I assume choir practice
is off.

04:07.948 --> 04:09.717
I'm just get out of here
before I get adopted.

04:09.750 --> 04:12.252
- [laughs]
- That's Dr. Arthur Cochran--

04:12.286 --> 04:14.455
our choir director
and resident quipster.

04:14.488 --> 04:16.990
Ha ha, Arthur.
Bye!

04:17.024 --> 04:19.493
- Were we just in the presence
of the Arthur Cochran,

04:19.527 --> 04:21.161
the--the famous conductor?

04:21.194 --> 04:22.796
- Throw in "rumpled"
and "handsome,"

04:22.830 --> 04:24.665
and, yes,
you would be correct.

04:24.698 --> 04:26.967
Hi.
- We are such huge fans.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.502
- Well, thank you.

04:28.536 --> 04:30.838
- Your Princeton Chamber Choir
recording

04:30.871 --> 04:32.606
of Handel's "Messiah"
was exulting.

04:32.640 --> 04:34.074
- Well, actually,
"The New York Times"

04:34.107 --> 04:35.676
used the word
"revelatory,"

04:35.709 --> 04:36.910
but let's not get
caught up in semantics.

04:36.944 --> 04:38.111
"Exulting" will do.

04:38.145 --> 04:39.447
You know what I'm gonna
do for you?

04:39.480 --> 04:41.014
I've got some 8x10s
in my bag.

04:41.048 --> 04:42.850
I keep 'em handy
for fans like you.

04:42.883 --> 04:44.452
- Oh. [gasps]
- Whoop.

04:44.485 --> 04:45.953
[air hissing,
"Jingle Bells" playing]

04:45.986 --> 04:47.187
- Oh, no.
- Jax.

04:47.220 --> 04:49.423
- A Santa Claus
in a church?

04:49.457 --> 04:51.359
- Well, we have a lot
of families here.

04:51.392 --> 04:53.827
And the kids love it.
- Yeah, of course they do.

04:53.861 --> 04:58.198
But only God can give you the
true gift of everlasting life.

04:58.231 --> 05:00.601
- Thank goodness Anjali
didn't see this.

05:00.634 --> 05:03.704
- Okay, who should I make
this out to--is it Luke?

05:03.737 --> 05:06.674
It's fans like you
that make stars like me.

05:06.707 --> 05:08.642
How about that?
- Excuse me, I'll just...

05:08.676 --> 05:10.644
[holiday music playing,
air hissing]

05:10.678 --> 05:12.112
- Oh. You okay, Jax?
- Yes.

05:12.145 --> 05:14.281
[music stops]

05:14.314 --> 05:16.784
- Amen!

05:16.817 --> 05:20.320
- Oh, hey, Jenny, do you still
need me to swing by later

05:20.354 --> 05:22.790
and install that, uh--
- Please don't say "pipe."

05:22.823 --> 05:24.024
- Pipe.

05:24.057 --> 05:27.461
Yeah, okay, I'll bring
my toolbox.

05:27.495 --> 05:29.530
- So how long have you two
been hooking up?

05:29.563 --> 05:31.965
- What?
Oh, no, that's crazy.

05:31.999 --> 05:33.200
- Is it?
[laughs]

05:33.233 --> 05:35.135
- Okay, fine.
How did you know?

05:35.168 --> 05:36.404
- I have a sixth sense.

05:36.437 --> 05:38.171
I know when stuff
is gonna happen.

05:38.205 --> 05:40.140
Like, I knew the ending
of "The Sixth Sense."

05:40.173 --> 05:41.975
- Please, just don't make
a big thing out of this.

05:42.009 --> 05:43.844
- I won't,
but you have to tell me why.

05:43.877 --> 05:45.646
- I don't know.

05:45.679 --> 05:48.749
Sneaking around is kind of hot,
you know?

05:48.782 --> 05:50.851
I mean, it reminds me
of when we were in high school

05:50.884 --> 05:53.987
and my parents thought Wayne
was a stone-cold loser

05:54.021 --> 05:55.923
just 'cause
he was on unemployment.

05:55.956 --> 05:58.692
[chuckles, clicks tongue]
- You have grown since then.

05:58.726 --> 06:00.093
Wayne has not.

06:00.127 --> 06:01.862
Isn't that why you wanted
to divorce him?

06:01.895 --> 06:03.230
- We're just having fun.

06:03.263 --> 06:04.698
It'll all be over
by New Year's.

06:04.732 --> 06:06.366
I just--I need to get him
out of my system.

06:06.400 --> 06:08.902
- Ugh, like a bad taco
or a blood-borne illness.

06:08.936 --> 06:11.405
It sounds fun.
- Shh.

06:11.439 --> 06:14.842
- This is so much better than
the food we had in Indonesia.

06:14.875 --> 06:16.944
- We ate
so much Sbarro's there.

06:16.977 --> 06:19.279
[laughing]
- I'll be right back.

06:19.312 --> 06:20.881
Oh, milk.

06:22.883 --> 06:25.285
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Easy, tiger.

06:25.318 --> 06:27.120
- I love having my parents
in town,

06:27.154 --> 06:28.889
but they're so successful.

06:28.922 --> 06:30.958
I can't help but feeling
like a loser around them.

06:30.991 --> 06:33.761
- You're not a loser.
You got a lot going for you.

06:33.794 --> 06:37.130
Number one--you know me,
and your parents love me.

06:37.164 --> 06:39.433
Watch this.

06:39.467 --> 06:41.902
Hey, guys, how's lunch going?
Can I get you anything?

06:41.935 --> 06:45.238
Maybe, uh, I don't know, a
selfie with a famous conductor?

06:45.272 --> 06:46.940
[laughter]
Are there any around?

06:46.974 --> 06:48.809
Oh, wait, that's right.
Me!

06:48.842 --> 06:51.278
[both laugh]
- That would be such a treat.

06:51.311 --> 06:53.080
- You know,
I'm sure the real treat

06:53.113 --> 06:55.048
would be for you to watch
me conduct.

06:55.082 --> 06:56.917
I'm so sorry you won't be here
for our Christmas concert.

06:56.950 --> 06:58.619
- Oh, we could have had
the live broadcast.

06:58.652 --> 07:00.320
Our two million
YouTube subscribers

07:00.353 --> 07:02.456
would have loved that.
- Two million?

07:02.490 --> 07:05.258
- Yes, but, sadly, we are
boarding a plane for Thailand

07:05.292 --> 07:06.460
on Saturday.
- Aw.

07:06.494 --> 07:08.462
- Well, that's ridiculous.

07:08.496 --> 07:10.097
We can j--we'll move
the concert up.

07:10.130 --> 07:11.565
We'll just do it
on Friday, right?

07:11.599 --> 07:13.066
Could we?
- Yes!

07:13.100 --> 07:15.335
Then you can see the church
packed to capacity.

07:15.368 --> 07:17.738
- Oh, wonderful.
- Friday it is.

07:17.771 --> 07:19.507
- Are you insane?

07:19.540 --> 07:21.609
- That's the night
of the big UK game.

07:21.642 --> 07:23.611
- Everyone'll be watching.
The church'll be empty.

07:23.644 --> 07:25.445
- [coughing]

07:25.479 --> 07:27.014
Yeah, I think I'm coming down
with something.

07:27.047 --> 07:28.516
I don't think
I can be there either.

07:28.549 --> 07:29.950
- My parents want
to see a concert,

07:29.983 --> 07:31.485
and you are not going
to disappoint them.

07:31.519 --> 07:34.488
So you will show up,
and you will like it!

07:34.522 --> 07:37.491
- Wow, you really went
Full Metal Cardigan there,

07:37.525 --> 07:38.458
didn't you?

07:41.161 --> 07:43.631
- How are we gonna find
100 people who don't want

07:43.664 --> 07:45.198
to watch the UK game?
- They can DVR it.

07:45.232 --> 07:47.034
Everyone knows the game is so
much more exciting to watch

07:47.067 --> 07:48.836
after it's ended and you know
the score from social media.

07:48.869 --> 07:50.671
- Who cares about the people
in the church?

07:50.704 --> 07:52.506
There'll be over two million
people around the world

07:52.540 --> 07:53.941
watching it on YouTube.

07:53.974 --> 07:56.376
- Two million people?
Well, that's amazing.

07:56.409 --> 07:57.978
- No, no celebrating yet.
You still suck.

07:58.011 --> 07:59.847
- We don't even have
an audience.

07:59.880 --> 08:02.550
Brains, brawn, you're in charge
of getting butts in the seats.

08:02.583 --> 08:04.885
I'm sorry--when I get stressed,
I lose my filter.

08:04.918 --> 08:06.453
- Okay, shall we dive in?

08:06.486 --> 08:08.055
- You heard the man.
Focus.

08:08.088 --> 08:10.223
We need to practice 24-7
and find an audience

08:10.257 --> 08:11.825
the other 24-7.

08:11.859 --> 08:14.528
- This schedule's gonna cut
into our fun.

08:14.562 --> 08:16.396
- We found out a way to have
sex on our class field trip

08:16.429 --> 08:18.899
to Abraham Lincoln's
birthplace--we can do this.

08:18.932 --> 08:20.834
- I still have that hat.
- I still have that beard.

08:20.868 --> 08:22.803
- Ginny, Wayne!
Pay attention!

08:22.836 --> 08:24.371
[chimes playing]
Carla!

08:24.404 --> 08:26.006
Stop hitting those chimes!

08:26.039 --> 08:27.875
- They're for
"Carol of the Bells."

08:27.908 --> 08:29.743
- Carla,
don't just stand there!

08:29.777 --> 08:31.411
Hit those chimes!

08:31.444 --> 08:33.547
all: * Hark how the bells,
sweet silver bells *

08:33.581 --> 08:35.749
* All seem to say,
throw cares away *

08:35.783 --> 08:37.985
* Christmas is here,
bringing good cheer *

08:38.018 --> 08:40.588
* To young and old,
meek and the bold *

08:40.621 --> 08:42.422
* Ding-dong, ding-dong,
that is their song *

08:42.455 --> 08:45.525
* With joyful ring,
all caroling *

08:45.559 --> 08:47.661
* One seems to hear,
words of good cheer *

08:47.695 --> 08:49.396
* From everywhere,
filling the air *

08:49.429 --> 08:52.065
* Oh, how they pound,
raising the sound *

08:52.099 --> 08:54.201
* O'er hill and dale,
telling their tale *

08:54.234 --> 08:56.403
* Gaily they ring
while people sing *

08:56.436 --> 08:58.005
* Songs of good cheer
- Be better!

08:58.038 --> 08:59.707
all:
* Christmas is here

08:59.740 --> 09:01.374
* Merry, merry, merry,
merry Christmas *

09:01.408 --> 09:03.510
* Merry, merry, merry,
merry Christmas *

09:03.543 --> 09:05.879
* On, on they send,
on without end *

09:05.913 --> 09:08.215
* Their joyful tone
to every home *

09:08.248 --> 09:10.550
* Hark how the bells,
sweet silver bells *

09:10.584 --> 09:12.953
* All seem to say,
throw cares away *

09:12.986 --> 09:15.455
* Christmas is here,
bringing good cheer *

09:15.488 --> 09:17.691
* To young and old,
meek and the bold *

09:17.725 --> 09:19.960
* Ding-dong, ding-dong,
that is their song *

09:19.993 --> 09:22.362
* With joyful ring,
all caroling *

09:22.395 --> 09:24.632
* One seems to hear,
words of good cheer *

09:24.665 --> 09:27.034
* From everywhere,
filling the air *

09:27.067 --> 09:29.269
* Oh, how they pound,
raising the sound *

09:29.302 --> 09:31.271
* O'er hill and dale,
telling their tale *

09:31.304 --> 09:33.874
* Gaily they ring
while people sing *

09:33.907 --> 09:35.876
* Songs of good cheer,
Christmas is here *

09:35.909 --> 09:38.545
* Merry, merry, merry,
merry Christmas *

09:38.578 --> 09:40.948
* Merry, merry, merry,
merry Christmas *

09:40.981 --> 09:43.416
* On, on they send,
on without end *

09:43.450 --> 09:45.919
* Their joyful tone
to every home *

09:45.953 --> 09:48.321
* On, on they send
on without end *

09:48.355 --> 09:53.226
* Their joyful tone
to every home *

09:53.260 --> 09:57.631
* Ding-dong, ding-dong

09:57.665 --> 10:00.634
* Bom

10:00.668 --> 10:02.703
*

10:03.871 --> 10:05.939
- what, you have
a fly, right?

10:05.973 --> 10:07.675
- [gasps] Hey.
- Oh.

10:07.708 --> 10:09.142
- Hi, there.

10:09.176 --> 10:13.647
- Um, we like to pray
in the supply closet

10:13.681 --> 10:17.117
'cause, you know...
[scoffs] Jesus was a carpenter.

10:17.150 --> 10:20.120
- Ah.
[door closes]

10:20.153 --> 10:21.922
- Mom and Dad.
- Oh, hi, sweetheart.

10:21.955 --> 10:23.490
We are going to a fundraiser,

10:23.523 --> 10:25.358
and I wonder if you
could watch Anjali for a bit.

10:25.392 --> 10:27.928
She's slow to warm up, but--
- Of course.

10:27.961 --> 10:31.498
It'll be fun to connect
with someone 30 years younger.

10:31.531 --> 10:33.033
[door closes]
- Hey.

10:33.066 --> 10:35.936
Everyone is so excited
about this concert on Friday.

10:35.969 --> 10:37.938
I was thinking, at the risk
of blowing out the Internet,

10:37.971 --> 10:40.473
maybe I should record a promo
for the fans.

10:40.507 --> 10:42.209
- You mean build a little buzz?

10:42.242 --> 10:43.643
- Yeah.
- Rolling.

10:43.677 --> 10:46.279
- Hello,
I'm Dr. Arthur Cochran,

10:46.313 --> 10:49.683
and I want you to tune into our
Christmas concert this Friday.

10:49.717 --> 10:52.019
It's doctor's orders!

10:52.052 --> 10:53.887
- Fantastic.
Nice take.

10:53.921 --> 10:55.155
- It's not a take.
It's a gift.

10:55.188 --> 10:57.891
- [laughs] See ya later.
- See ya.

10:57.925 --> 11:00.327
- So you want to watch your
big brother sing in a choir?

11:00.360 --> 11:02.830
[door opens, closes]

11:02.863 --> 11:05.165
Okay.
[sighs]

11:05.198 --> 11:07.400
Cash!
You're a child.

11:07.434 --> 11:09.069
Anjali's a child, too.

11:09.102 --> 11:11.038
Why don't you two go play
in my office?

11:11.071 --> 11:12.472
- Actually, I--

11:12.505 --> 11:14.374
- Wouldn't want
to disappoint God?

11:14.407 --> 11:17.310
[country-tinged holiday music]

11:17.344 --> 11:21.248
*

11:21.281 --> 11:23.016
- Can I try?

11:23.050 --> 11:24.718
- I mean, I guess.

11:24.752 --> 11:26.987
It's kind of complicated,
though.

11:27.020 --> 11:29.589
[gunshots and screaming
on video game]

11:29.622 --> 11:32.559
Did you just make
a pipe bomb out of a sneaker?

11:32.592 --> 11:35.328
I didn't know
you could do that.

11:35.362 --> 11:37.497
- How do I get one of these?
- I don't know.

11:37.530 --> 11:39.699
Ask Santa.
- Who?

11:39.733 --> 11:42.435
- You don't know
who Santa is?

11:42.469 --> 11:45.038
I'm about
to blow your mind.

11:45.072 --> 11:47.775
- Athanasios, you like music.

11:47.808 --> 11:50.543
Come to the Christmas concert
on Friday.

11:50.577 --> 11:53.747
- Ah.
No, thank you.

11:53.781 --> 11:55.682
- A little less
second-grade teacher,

11:55.715 --> 11:57.417
a little more "Godfather."

11:57.450 --> 12:00.020
Make him an offer
he can't refuse.

12:00.053 --> 12:02.722
Hey, isn't your family in town?
- They are.

12:02.756 --> 12:05.125
- Bring them to the concert,
and I'll give you a day off.

12:05.158 --> 12:08.796
- Throw in Greek Easter and my
yia-yia's birthday, and I'm in.

12:08.829 --> 12:10.463
- You drive a hard bargain.
- Hmm.

12:12.933 --> 12:14.434
- He should've held out.

12:14.467 --> 12:17.070
I was gonna
give him health insurance.

12:17.104 --> 12:18.939
- I am so excited
about this concert.

12:18.972 --> 12:21.641
I just hope I can whip
the choir into shape by Friday.

12:21.674 --> 12:23.743
- Ask Santa for help.
- What?

12:23.777 --> 12:25.612
[chuckles awkwardly]
Santa? Who's that?

12:25.645 --> 12:27.580
No one, that's who.
- You've never heard of Santa?

12:27.614 --> 12:29.149
He's just like Jesus,

12:29.182 --> 12:31.084
but he rewards people who
behave righteously with toys.

12:31.118 --> 12:33.053
- Interesting--
they are kind of similar,

12:33.086 --> 12:34.587
aside from the obvious
weight difference.

12:34.621 --> 12:37.124
- No, he's nothing
like Jesus, okay?

12:37.157 --> 12:39.126
- So did you two have fun?
- So much fun.

12:39.159 --> 12:40.627
I learned about Santa.

12:40.660 --> 12:42.629
He's gonna bring me this game
called "Murder Car,"

12:42.662 --> 12:44.597
where you kill people
and then steal their cars.

12:44.631 --> 12:46.299
- There's also prostitutes.
- [gasping]

12:46.333 --> 12:48.768
- What?
What can I talk about?

12:48.802 --> 12:51.604
- Jax--sweetheart, your brother
has led you astray.

12:54.374 --> 12:56.643
- [sighs]
That was so fun,

12:56.676 --> 12:59.913
I am not even gonna eat
my feelings about it later.

12:59.947 --> 13:01.681
- That's good, 'cause Dwayne
only eats rabbit food.

13:01.714 --> 13:02.816
- [chuckles]

13:02.850 --> 13:04.517
Ew, gross!

13:04.551 --> 13:06.486
I thought you gave up
chewing tobacco.

13:06.519 --> 13:08.321
- Oh.
- Oh.

13:08.355 --> 13:10.190
[objects rattle]

13:11.959 --> 13:14.194
[gasps]
That's my birthstone.

13:14.227 --> 13:16.496
- Mm-hmm.

13:16.529 --> 13:18.265
- What happened to no strings?

13:18.298 --> 13:21.468
- Yeah, see, I don't think
I can do no strings,

13:21.501 --> 13:23.703
especially with you,

13:23.736 --> 13:25.605
'cause I never wanted
to break our strings.

13:25.638 --> 13:27.807
- Whoa.

13:27.841 --> 13:29.509
I need to think about this.

13:29.542 --> 13:30.710
- I understand.
It's a lot.

13:30.743 --> 13:32.179
- Mm-hmm.
- I'll take 'em back.

13:32.212 --> 13:33.646
- Whoa, no.
You just gave 'em to me.

13:33.680 --> 13:35.782
No backsies.
- They're real, too.

13:35.815 --> 13:37.650
They won't turn your ear green
or nothing.

13:39.920 --> 13:42.655
- So, Barb, what are you doing
this Friday?

13:42.689 --> 13:45.558
- I'm going to
the Wildcats game, obviously.

13:45.592 --> 13:49.496
- It would mean a lot if you
came to the Christmas concert.

13:49.529 --> 13:52.632
- Can I have a solo?
- You're not in the choir.

13:52.665 --> 13:55.969
- Can I be in the choir?
- Um...

13:56.003 --> 13:58.205
If you bring
three friends, sure.

13:58.238 --> 14:00.040
- All right.

14:00.073 --> 14:03.676
- Ah, please tell me Wayne
didn't buy you those earrings.

14:03.710 --> 14:05.412
- He's a new man.

14:05.445 --> 14:07.414
They're the first gift he gave
me that I don't have to feed.

14:07.447 --> 14:10.183
- You know Wayne
better than I do.

14:10.217 --> 14:12.552
- Mm-hmm.
- So you'd know how a man

14:12.585 --> 14:14.554
who tries to pay his tab
in snake eggs

14:14.587 --> 14:16.223
would be able to
afford fancy earrings.

14:16.256 --> 14:18.725
- I don't have to ask.
I trust him.

14:18.758 --> 14:22.595
- Trust him enough to still
have a joint bank account?

14:22.629 --> 14:25.565
[suspicious music]

14:25.598 --> 14:29.836
*

14:29.869 --> 14:32.705
- [gasps]
Son of a B!

14:32.739 --> 14:33.907
[groans]

14:35.542 --> 14:37.010
- Where's Mom and Dad?

14:37.044 --> 14:38.845
- They're in the back recording
a sermon for YouTube.

14:38.878 --> 14:41.848
I'm sure it's
"prodigal son" related.

14:41.881 --> 14:44.384
You sure love the Bible,
don't you?

14:44.417 --> 14:45.852
- Well, we move around a lot.

14:45.885 --> 14:47.454
It's one thing
I can always count on.

14:47.487 --> 14:49.456
- It's not easy bouncing around
all the time.

14:49.489 --> 14:52.025
[chuckles] I used to sneak away
and watch movies.

14:52.059 --> 14:54.061
You should've seen
the look on Dad's face

14:54.094 --> 14:56.363
when he caught me watching "If
Rosemary had Baptized her Baby,

14:56.396 --> 14:57.897
None of This
Would've Happened."

14:57.931 --> 15:00.033
- I used to love
watching movies.

15:00.067 --> 15:02.202
I watched them all the time
back in India.

15:02.235 --> 15:03.370
- What was your favorite?

15:03.403 --> 15:05.138
- Anything
with Priyanka Chopra.

15:05.172 --> 15:06.940
- I love her.
- Her Bollywood stuff.

15:06.974 --> 15:08.575
Not the lifeguard movie called

15:08.608 --> 15:10.477
"Running Around
in Red Swimsuits is a Sin."

15:10.510 --> 15:12.912
- Would it be all right
if I tousled your hair?

15:12.946 --> 15:14.948
- I'd rather you didn't.
- And that's why I asked.

15:14.982 --> 15:16.683
[chuckles awkwardly]

15:18.118 --> 15:20.887
- That was nice.
Except for that hair tousle.

15:20.920 --> 15:22.622
That was weird.
- It felt weird.

15:22.655 --> 15:24.224
- Yeah, it creeped me out.

15:24.257 --> 15:26.126
- Do you think my parents
will get mad

15:26.159 --> 15:28.395
about the whole movie thing?

15:28.428 --> 15:31.464
- What, you connected with her.
You--you made her smile.

15:31.498 --> 15:33.433
Isn't that what church
is all about?

15:33.466 --> 15:35.602
- Could you repeat that
when my parents are around

15:35.635 --> 15:38.671
so they know I successfully
ministered to an atheist?

15:38.705 --> 15:40.673
- Jax, forget about
what your parents think.

15:40.707 --> 15:43.143
This is your church.

15:43.176 --> 15:45.945
You need to think about
how you want to reach people.

15:47.647 --> 15:50.117
We have 24 hours
before the concert.

15:50.150 --> 15:53.020
What do you say--you want
to Jax it up a little bit?

15:53.053 --> 15:56.589
- Maybe, but it'll still be
to an empty church.

15:56.623 --> 15:58.691
- You worry about the music.
I'll worry about the crowd.

15:58.725 --> 16:00.994
Actually, I'll worry
about the music and the crowd.

16:01.028 --> 16:02.795
- Can someone take this?

16:02.829 --> 16:05.765
I don't want to be seen
with a big pair of scissors.

16:05.798 --> 16:07.767
People project aggression
onto men of my stature.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.136
- Don't pass them to me.

16:09.169 --> 16:10.637
I can't look my friends
in the eye

16:10.670 --> 16:11.938
knowing I cut off
the UK game.

16:11.971 --> 16:13.440
- Come on, give it to me.

16:13.473 --> 16:15.775
The only thing people project
on me is privilege.

16:15.808 --> 16:19.979
Remember, after all,
this is for Jax.

16:20.013 --> 16:21.681
- It's this one right here.

16:21.714 --> 16:24.551
I appreciate you making such
a huge sacrifice for a friend.

16:24.584 --> 16:25.985
- What sacrifice?

16:26.019 --> 16:27.320
- This is
the Internet connection

16:27.354 --> 16:28.721
as well as the cable.

16:28.755 --> 16:30.323
You're cutting off our chances
to broadcast the concert

16:30.357 --> 16:31.958
on YouTube.

16:31.991 --> 16:35.028
- Torn between a return to
relevance

16:35.062 --> 16:36.863
and helping a weirdo
in a cardigan

16:36.896 --> 16:38.998
who I didn't even know
four months ago.

16:39.032 --> 16:40.733
- He looks really cute
in that cardigan, though.

16:40.767 --> 16:42.302
- Damn it.

16:42.335 --> 16:44.137
He does.

16:44.171 --> 16:46.173
[electricity whirs off]
Let's go!

16:46.206 --> 16:48.007
Go, go!
- Got it.

16:48.041 --> 16:49.909
- [humming innocently]

16:54.747 --> 16:56.383
- There you are.

16:56.416 --> 16:57.917
Did you take money
from our joint account

16:57.950 --> 16:58.985
to buy those earrings?

16:59.018 --> 17:01.020
- Part of it, yeah,

17:01.054 --> 17:02.989
but then the rest I invested
in my buddy Dookie's business.

17:03.022 --> 17:05.024
- I can't believe
I thought you changed.

17:05.058 --> 17:07.060
This is something the old Wayne
would've done,

17:07.094 --> 17:09.396
and in case you forgot,
he's the one I'm divorcing.

17:09.429 --> 17:11.098
- It's a can't-miss.

17:11.131 --> 17:13.100
He's turning
Tracy Chapman lyrics

17:13.133 --> 17:15.568
into inspirational towels.

17:17.237 --> 17:19.506
- Take these back.

17:19.539 --> 17:20.740
I think it's best we start

17:20.773 --> 17:22.675
our New Year's resolution
early this year.

17:22.709 --> 17:24.277
- Oh, but, Jenny...

17:24.311 --> 17:26.579
Tracy Chapman's
never been hotter.

17:26.613 --> 17:28.081
This is her year.

17:28.115 --> 17:29.549
[indistinct chatter]

17:29.582 --> 17:31.284
- Look at this crowd.

17:31.318 --> 17:33.253
We haven't had this many people
since Google Maps

17:33.286 --> 17:36.289
accidentally listed us
as a "Second First Churros."

17:36.323 --> 17:37.957
[indistinct chatter]

17:37.990 --> 17:39.859
- What is Barb doing here?

17:39.892 --> 17:41.728
- Oh, she's in the choir now,
and she has a solo.

17:41.761 --> 17:44.797
- What?
- Go with it.

17:44.831 --> 17:47.134
- [sighs]
Good evening, everyone!

17:47.167 --> 17:49.569
Welcome to The Second First
Church of the Cumberlands.

17:49.602 --> 17:51.704
I, of course, am
world-renowned choir director

17:51.738 --> 17:53.140
Dr. Arthur Cochran.

17:53.173 --> 17:55.108
I have worked
with bigger choirs.

17:55.142 --> 17:56.876
I have worked
with better choirs.

17:56.909 --> 17:58.445
But I have never worked
with a choir

17:58.478 --> 18:00.813
that has made me so happy, and
that is because of one man--

18:00.847 --> 18:01.914
Our Reverend Jax.

18:01.948 --> 18:04.484
Give him a hand.
[applause]

18:04.517 --> 18:08.155
So, this year, we're
celebrating Christmas his way.

18:08.188 --> 18:12.259
[quietly] And apparently anyone
is allowed to join.

18:12.292 --> 18:16.329
all: * Joy to the world,
the Lord has come *

18:16.363 --> 18:20.500
* Let Earth receive her King

18:20.533 --> 18:22.135
* Yeah

18:22.169 --> 18:25.004
- You guys!
It's a Bollywood Christmas!

18:25.037 --> 18:28.641
* Joy to the World

18:28.675 --> 18:32.312
* The Lord has come

18:32.345 --> 18:34.581
* Let Earth
- * Let Earth

18:34.614 --> 18:36.516
- * Receive
- * Receive

18:36.549 --> 18:38.084
all:
* Her King!

18:38.117 --> 18:40.187
* Santa Claus
is coming to town *

18:40.220 --> 18:44.691
* Let every heart

18:44.724 --> 18:48.528
* Prepare Him room

18:48.561 --> 18:52.999
* You better watch out,
you better not cry *

18:53.032 --> 18:56.269
* You better not pout,
I'm telling you why *

18:56.303 --> 18:58.605
* And Heaven
- * And Heaven

18:58.638 --> 19:05.312
all: * And Heaven
and Nature sing *

19:05.345 --> 19:09.482
* Santa Claus
is coming to town! *

19:09.516 --> 19:12.719
* Joy to the world,
joy to the world! *

19:12.752 --> 19:19.226
* Santa Claus
is coming to town *

19:19.259 --> 19:21.794
- Ho, ho, ho, ho!

19:21.828 --> 19:25.532
all: * Santa Claus is coming
to town *

19:25.565 --> 19:28.901
* Joy to the world,
joy to the world *

19:28.935 --> 19:33.673
* Santa Claus
is coming to town *

19:33.706 --> 19:37.009
- Don't forget--
keep the Christ in Christmas.

19:37.043 --> 19:41.681
all:
* Santa Claus is coming

19:41.714 --> 19:43.550
* To town

19:43.583 --> 19:50.223
* Joy to the world

19:50.257 --> 19:54.193
[cheers and applause]

20:00.900 --> 20:04.371
- That service was awesome!
Is it always like this?

20:04.404 --> 20:05.872
- We try.

20:05.905 --> 20:07.674
Next week I'll be improv'ing
my sermon.

20:07.707 --> 20:10.076
Like, I'll ask for a place, and
someone will yell, "Heaven!"

20:10.109 --> 20:12.178
And then I'll, like, riff
for 30 to 40 minutes.

20:12.211 --> 20:14.881
- I'll be back for that.
- [laughs]

20:14.914 --> 20:17.884
So, uh, I know my service
was a little, uh...

20:17.917 --> 20:20.052
unorthodox.

20:20.086 --> 20:22.422
- Unorthodox, uncouth,
uncalled for...

20:22.455 --> 20:25.224
- But you did get Anjali
to come out of her shell.

20:25.258 --> 20:26.926
- So you must be doing
something right.

20:26.959 --> 20:29.629
- Boy, I'll say.
That service was so moving,

20:29.662 --> 20:31.298
it almost caused me
to doubt my atheism.

20:31.331 --> 20:32.699
- [gasps]

20:32.732 --> 20:34.767
- I'm kidding.
Merry Christmas.

20:34.801 --> 20:37.270
- I, uh--I thought
about what you said,

20:37.304 --> 20:39.472
and, uh, I'm gonna go
to the bank tomorrow

20:39.506 --> 20:41.073
and open up my own account.

20:41.107 --> 20:43.576
- Oh, well, thank you, but that
doesn't change anything.

20:43.610 --> 20:45.111
- I know.

20:45.144 --> 20:47.314
I also started a college fund
for Cash.

20:47.347 --> 20:49.482
- With what money?

20:49.516 --> 20:51.050
- Well, it turns out
that Costco

20:51.083 --> 20:52.785
picked up Dookie's towels.

20:52.819 --> 20:56.289
We made our investment back
plus a little something extra.

20:56.323 --> 20:59.559
- Well, I guess it is
Tracy Chapman's year.

20:59.592 --> 21:01.928
- Sure is.
Look at us.

21:01.961 --> 21:04.431
We made it through this
no strings attached.

21:04.464 --> 21:05.932
- [sighs]

21:05.965 --> 21:09.436
There is one tiny string.

21:09.469 --> 21:11.438
I might be pregnant.

21:11.471 --> 21:13.740
[suspenseful music]

21:13.773 --> 21:16.809
- Well...

21:16.843 --> 21:19.979
Cash won't be happy
that half his $38

21:20.012 --> 21:22.515
is going into
the baby's account, but...

21:22.549 --> 21:23.916
- [sighs]

21:23.950 --> 21:25.552
- It's only right.
