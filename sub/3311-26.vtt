00:11.179 --> 00:13.547

00:13.581 --> 00:15.483
- "TICKETS NOT AVAILABLE."
- REFRESH!

00:15.516 --> 00:18.452
SPITTING ON MY NECK

00:18.486 --> 00:20.454
- "TICKETS AVAILABLE."
- OH MY GOD.

00:20.488 --> 00:23.591

00:31.332 --> 00:33.567
- EVERYTHING OKAY IN HERE?

00:33.601 --> 00:35.503
- OOH.

00:35.536 --> 00:37.338
( loud thud )

00:37.371 --> 00:39.340
I'M OKAY!

00:39.373 --> 00:42.210
FLOOR SEATS, HUH? WHAT'S
THE SPECIAL OCCASION?

00:42.243 --> 00:44.278
OH, LENNOX AND I
ARE CELEBRATING.

00:44.312 --> 00:47.115
FRIDAY IS THE ANNIVERSARY
OF MY AWESOMENESS.

00:47.148 --> 00:49.283
DOES THAT MEAN I GET MONDAY OFF?

00:49.317 --> 00:50.851
70 SECONDS.

00:50.884 --> 00:53.187
OH, THIS IS SO MUCH FUN...
JUST LIKE THE OLD DAYS.

00:53.221 --> 00:55.356
LENNOX AND I USED TO GO
TO CONCERTS ALL THE TIME.

00:55.389 --> 00:59.327
WE WENT TO AARON
CARTER, SHeDAISY, 98°.

00:59.360 --> 01:02.363
AH, YES. ALL THE LEGENDS
OF THE 99¢ BIN.

01:02.396 --> 01:06.200
- IS THAT BACK WHEN YOU WERE FUN AUNT MEL?
- I'M STILL FUN AUNT MEL.

01:06.234 --> 01:07.635
NO, NOW YOU'RE
PARENT-FIGURE AUNT MEL.

01:07.668 --> 01:09.570
YOUR JOB IS NOT TO BE LIKED...
IT'S TO BE RESPECTED.

01:09.603 --> 01:12.473
IF IT'S ALL ABOUT RESPECT, THEN
EXPLAIN TO ME HOW COME THEY LIKE YOU.

01:12.506 --> 01:14.542
'CAUSE I'M LIKEABLE.
EVERYBODY LIKES ME.

01:14.575 --> 01:16.544
NO, IT'S TRUE... WOMEN,
MEN, CHILDREN...

01:16.577 --> 01:18.312
FISH.

01:18.346 --> 01:20.148
I'M JUST, UH, FRIGGIN' LIKEABLE.

01:20.181 --> 01:22.216
I DON'T FRIGGIN' SEE IT.

01:24.252 --> 01:25.553
ALL RIGHT, HERE.

01:26.554 --> 01:28.622
CUTE PURSE.

01:28.656 --> 01:31.625
ALL RIGHT. "TO COMPLETE YOUR
PURCHASE, TYPE THIS WORD."

01:31.659 --> 01:33.661
- HURRY HURRY, 10 SECONDS.
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN WORD?

01:33.694 --> 01:35.896
I CAN'T READ THAT. THOSE
LETTERS LOOK DRUNK.

01:35.929 --> 01:38.532
IT'S "DILDSLARV."

01:38.566 --> 01:40.868
NO, I THINK IT'S "BILLSCLARF."

01:40.901 --> 01:42.636
LADIES, CLEARLY IT'S "PISLITZ."

01:42.670 --> 01:44.672
AH. "BILLSCLARF," BITCHES.

01:44.705 --> 01:46.674
AH! YOU DID IT!
OH, THAT'S GREAT.

01:46.707 --> 01:49.443
I'M GONNA GO ON
FACEBOOK AND eBRAG.

01:51.512 --> 01:53.614
LOOK AT THAT. YOU JUST
BOUGHT YOURSELF SOME LOVE.

01:53.647 --> 01:55.316
YES I DID. AND I GOT MILES.

01:56.517 --> 01:58.386
HEY, JOE, I GOT BACK
THAT HISTORY PAPER

01:58.419 --> 02:00.554
- YOU HELPED ME WITH.
- DON'T LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT.

02:00.588 --> 02:02.523
I JUST GAVE THE BOY
A LITTLE GUIDANCE.

02:02.556 --> 02:05.393
A "C"? THE GUY GAVE US A "C"?

02:05.426 --> 02:07.295
WELL, HOW MUCH OF
THIS "US" IS YOU?

02:07.328 --> 02:09.430
I DIDN'T DO HIS WORK FOR HIM. I
JUST PUT THE BALL ON THE TEE.

02:09.463 --> 02:11.499
RYDER DID THE SWINGING.
"YOU MISSED THE POINT.

02:11.532 --> 02:13.634
WRONG WRONG WRONG."

02:13.667 --> 02:15.436
"WEAK ARGUMENT"? ( snorts )

02:15.469 --> 02:17.938
- THIS BONEHEAD HATED EVERYTHING.
- HE LIKED THE MARGINS.

02:17.971 --> 02:21.242
NO, THAT SAYS "MARGINAL
UNDERSTANDING OF THE TOPIC."

02:21.275 --> 02:24.445
I'M GONNA HAVE TO SPEAK TO THIS GUY.
CLEARLY THE MAN'S AN IDIOT.

02:24.478 --> 02:26.647
- MAYBE DON'T OPEN WITH THAT...
- BUP-BUP-BUP. I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.

02:26.680 --> 02:28.716
YEAH YEAH. SENDING
ME TO SUMMER SCHOOL.

02:28.749 --> 02:31.652
- I OWE YOU, BUDDY.
- RYDER.

02:32.753 --> 02:35.556
WHO LIKES YOU MORE

03:50.298 --> 03:52.433
JOE... JOE, WHAT ARE
YOU DOING HERE?

03:52.466 --> 03:54.602
AT THE MOMENT?
RESTRAINING MYSELF.

03:54.635 --> 03:57.305
I'M JUST HERE TO STRAIGHTEN
SOME THINGS OUT, RYDER.

03:57.338 --> 03:59.273
NO! NO NO, DON'T STRAIGHTEN.

03:59.307 --> 04:01.575
HEY, RELAX, OKAY? COMRADE
BIRKENSTOCK AND I

04:01.609 --> 04:04.545
ARE GOING TO HAVE A VERY
MATURE, CALM CONVERSATION.

04:04.578 --> 04:06.547
LET ME FINISH, ALL RIGHT!?

04:06.580 --> 04:08.282
THE RAILROADS BUILT THIS
DAMN COUNTRY, BUDDY.

04:08.316 --> 04:09.817
IF YOU WEREN'T SUCH A
PINHEAD, YOU'D KNOW THAT.

04:09.850 --> 04:11.585
'CAUSE IF IT WASN'T
FOR THE RAILROADS,

04:11.619 --> 04:12.820
EVERYTHING WEST OF
THE MISSISSIPPI

04:12.853 --> 04:15.323
WOULD BE A BIG
BUFFALO'S BATHROOM.

04:15.356 --> 04:18.359
LOOK, I APPRECIATE YOU GETTING
ALL RED-FACED AND YELLING AT ME,

04:18.392 --> 04:20.428
AFTER ALL THAT'S WHY
I BECAME A TEACHER,

04:20.461 --> 04:22.563
BUT LET'S GET DOWN TO WHAT'S
REALLY BOTHERING YOU.

04:22.596 --> 04:24.832
EVERYBODY LIKES TO THINK
THEIR KID'S AN "A" STUDENT,

04:24.865 --> 04:28.502
WHEN THE HARSH REALITY
IS THE BURGERS.TTA FLIP

04:29.703 --> 04:32.840
THE HARSH REALITY IS "A"
- WORTHY PAPER.-LEVEL

04:32.873 --> 04:35.075
- THAT'S YOUR OPINION.
- THAT'S A MATTER OF FACT.

04:35.108 --> 04:36.844
- IT MIGHT JUST BE WRONG.
- OH, REALLY? REALLY?

04:36.877 --> 04:40.314
SO I GUESS MY COLLEGE HISTORY
GAVE THIS PAPER AN "A." N HE

04:40.348 --> 04:43.384
AND BY THE WAY, READ IT OUT
LOUD TO THE ENTIRE CLASS.

04:44.652 --> 04:47.488
...IN A DREAM THAT I ONCE HAD.

04:47.521 --> 04:49.723
SO THIS ISN'T ALL
RYDER'S WORK, HUH?

04:49.757 --> 04:52.426
HEH HEH HEH, WHAT? NO.

04:52.460 --> 04:55.329
THAT'S ALL RYDER'S WORK. SEE, I
JUST PUT THE BALL ON THE TEE.

04:55.363 --> 04:56.564
RYDER REALLY DID THE...

04:56.597 --> 04:59.433
YOU HAVE A INCREDIBLE SINGING
VOICE, DO YOU KNOW THAT?

04:59.467 --> 05:02.470
YOU MIGHT AS WELL BE
DEAD UNTIL YOU'RE 18!

05:02.503 --> 05:04.872
THERE'S MY HAPPY GIRL!

05:04.905 --> 05:07.074
YOU KNOW THOSE GREAT
TICKETS YOU GOT FOR ME

05:07.107 --> 05:09.477
AND THE GREAT TIME WE WERE
GONNA HAVE AT THE CONCERT?

05:09.510 --> 05:10.578
WELL, IT'S GONE... OBLITERATED.

05:10.611 --> 05:13.614
IT'S THE STUPID VORTEX
CLUB WHERE THE CONCERT IS.

05:13.647 --> 05:17.685
KATHY BATTERSBY TOLD ME IT'S AN 18-AND-OVER
CLUB AND THEY'RE SUPER STRICT.

05:17.718 --> 05:19.620
THAT'S RIDICULOUS. I'D NEVER
LET YOU DRINK OR ANYTHING.

05:19.653 --> 05:22.756
YEAH, KATHY'S SISTER SAID THE SAME
THING WHEN SHE TRIED TO GET CATHY IN.

05:22.790 --> 05:24.592
AND HER SISTER OFFERED
TO FRENCH THE BOUNCER.

05:24.625 --> 05:27.561
OH, THE OLD
FRENCH-THE-BOUNCER TRICK.

05:29.563 --> 05:33.601
I ALMOST... FORGOT THE PATHETIC
LENGTH SOME GIRLS WILL GO TO.

05:33.634 --> 05:36.737
LOOK, DON'T WORRY, LENNOX. WE
ARE GOING TO THAT CONCERT,

05:36.770 --> 05:39.740
YOU AND ME AND OUR OLD
FRIEND BODY GLITTER.

05:39.773 --> 05:42.510
ALL THE GLITTER IN THE
WORLD CAN'T FIX THIS.

05:42.543 --> 05:44.478
( gasps ) YOU DON'T MEAN THAT.

05:46.780 --> 05:49.717
- HEY.
- HEY, IT'S LATE. WHERE YOU GUYS BEEN?

05:49.750 --> 05:52.520
JOE WENT DOWN TO TRY AND GET
MY TEACHER TO CHANGE MY GRADE.

05:52.553 --> 05:55.423
AND HE DID. IT WENT FROM A "C"
ALL THE WAY UP TO AN "F."

05:55.456 --> 05:57.491
IT'S NOT A PERMANENT
"F," ALL RIGHT?

05:57.525 --> 05:59.660
HIS TEACHER JUST WANTS HIM TO
TWEAK HIS PAPER A LITTLE BIT.

05:59.693 --> 06:01.862
PFFFT, YEAH, WITH A
DIFFERENT SUBJECT

06:01.895 --> 06:04.798
AND ALL NEW WORDS AND ON A
SATURDAY IN FRONT OF MR. McKAY

06:04.832 --> 06:08.402
SO HE KNOWS NO ONE'S PUTTING
IT ON THE TEE FOR ME.

06:08.436 --> 06:09.803
I'M GONNA MAKE
THIS RIGHT, BUDDY!

06:09.837 --> 06:12.640
YEAH, WHY QUIT WHEN YOU
CAN MAKE IT WORSE?

06:13.674 --> 06:14.775
AUNT MEL, CATHY'S SISTER

06:14.808 --> 06:17.678
WANTS TO BUY OUR CONCERT TICKETS
SINCE WE CAN'T USE THEM.

06:17.711 --> 06:19.680
WHAT?! THERE'S NO
REASON TO SELL THEM.

06:19.713 --> 06:22.650
IT'S AN 18-AND-OVER
CLUB AND I'M NOT 18...

06:22.683 --> 06:24.184
OR OVER.

06:24.217 --> 06:28.522
OKAY, DON'T DO ANYTHING. NO
ONE HAS TO FRENCH ANYONE YET.

06:29.723 --> 06:31.625
I'LL KEEP MY TONGUE
IN ITS HOLSTER.

06:34.628 --> 06:36.764
MEL, WILL YOU STOP TRYING
SO HARD TO BE LIKED?

06:36.797 --> 06:38.699
YEAH, BUT SHE'S SO DISAPPOINTED.

06:38.732 --> 06:41.735
TOO BAD. THERE'S NOTHING YOU
CAN DO TO MAKE LENNOX 18.

06:44.872 --> 06:47.541
ONE FAKE I.D., PLEASE.

06:47.575 --> 06:49.577
IS THAT MEL BURKE?

06:49.610 --> 06:51.712
WALLY THE FAKE I.D. GUY!

06:51.745 --> 06:53.947
I'M SO GLAD TO SEE
YOU'RE STILL ALIVE.

06:53.981 --> 06:55.716
I'M MEAN FREE... I MEAN HERE.

06:55.749 --> 06:57.851
- ( chuckles )
- WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS

06:57.885 --> 06:59.753
I'M REALLY GLAD YOU'RE
OUT OF THAT COMA.

06:59.787 --> 07:02.590
- DID YOU GET MY CARD?
- I BET I DID.

07:02.623 --> 07:04.858
THIS IS MY NIECE LENNOX.

07:04.892 --> 07:06.860
SHE'S HERE FOR HER
FIRST FAKE I.D.

07:06.894 --> 07:09.497
OH, THAT'S SO SWEET.

07:09.530 --> 07:12.566
DOES SHE NEED A MEDICAL
MARIJUANA CARD TOO?

07:12.600 --> 07:15.002
I MIGHT HAVE A TOUCH
OF THE GLAUCOMA.

07:15.035 --> 07:18.205
OKAY, WE'RE GONNA LET
THAT CLEAR UP ON ITS OWN.

07:18.238 --> 07:19.873
SO JUST THE I.D. PLEASE.

07:19.907 --> 07:22.676
LENNOX, YOU ARE IN THE
PRESENCE OF A TRUE ARTIST.

07:22.710 --> 07:24.878
ALL RIGHT, SWEETHEART, HOW
OLD DO YOU WANT TO BE?

07:24.912 --> 07:28.015
- 21?
- SURE, 18 IT IS.

07:28.048 --> 07:30.217
I'D BUY THAT.

07:30.250 --> 07:33.220
HEY, GRAB A BROWNIE
WHILE YOU WAIT.

07:33.253 --> 07:35.789
NO! NO BAKED GOODS.

07:37.591 --> 07:40.227
THIS IS GREAT. MY AUNT'S
BUYING ME A FAKE I.D.

07:40.260 --> 07:41.562
UH-HUH. YOU KNOW
WHAT'S EVEN GREATER?

07:41.595 --> 07:44.031
THAT RIGHT AFTER THE CONCERT,
YOU'RE GONNA GIVE IT BACK TO ME.

07:44.064 --> 07:46.934
THAT'S OKAY. I'M STILL GONNA TELL
EVERYONE WHAT A GREAT AUNT I HAVE.

07:46.967 --> 07:48.636
OH, YOU SHOULD TOTALLY DO THAT!

07:48.669 --> 07:50.704
AND YOU KNOW WHO WOULD
BE GREAT NOT TO TELL?

07:50.738 --> 07:52.906
JOE. UP HIGH, SISTER FRIEND.

07:54.675 --> 07:57.010
IS THAT MEL BURKE?

08:10.023 --> 08:12.660
YEAH, I KNOW, COACH,
RULES ARE RULES.

08:12.693 --> 08:14.928
- I UNDERSTAND.
- WHAT'S UP, BUDDY?

08:14.962 --> 08:16.964
MORE GREAT NEWS.
BECAUSE OF MY "F"...

08:16.997 --> 08:20.534
NO, WAIT. SORRY, YOUR "F"... I
DON'T WANT TO STEAL CREDIT.

08:20.568 --> 08:22.936
I'M OFFICIALLY BENCHED
FROM THE SOCCER TEAM.

08:22.970 --> 08:25.673
WHAT?! DUDE, THAT IS IT. I
AM GONNA GO DOWN THERE...

08:25.706 --> 08:28.041
AND WHAT? PUNCH MR. McKAY
UNTIL HE GIVES ME AN "A"?

08:28.075 --> 08:29.843
HOPEFULLY IT WON'T COME TO THAT.

08:29.877 --> 08:31.779
I'VE GOT A LOT OF DIFFERENT
SPEEDS, ALL RIGHT?

08:31.812 --> 08:33.914
I'M A BUSINESSMAN. I KNOW HOW
TO GET THROUGH TO PEOPLE.

08:33.947 --> 08:36.049
OH YEAH, 'CAUSE YOU'RE KNOWN
FOR YOUR DELICATE TOUCH.

08:36.083 --> 08:37.985
WE'RE GONNA COME UP WITH
SOMETHING GOOD HERE

08:38.018 --> 08:40.754
AND I PROMISE I'M NOT GOING TO DO
ANYTHING UNLESS YOU'RE OKAY WITH IT.

08:40.788 --> 08:43.824
- I'M NOT OKAY WITH IT!
- THINK ABOUT IT. YOU'LL COME AROUND.

08:46.727 --> 08:49.029
- HAVE YOU SEEN MY RESEARCH NOTES?
- THOSE AREN'T THEM?

08:49.062 --> 08:51.699
NO, THESE ARE KINGS
OF LEON TICKETS.

08:51.732 --> 08:53.701
OH YEAH. WHICH YOUR
AUNT MEL AND LENNOX

08:53.734 --> 08:55.736
CAN'T USE ANYMORE BECAUSE
LENNOX IS NOT 18.

08:55.769 --> 08:57.805
- THAT'S A SHAME.
- YEAH.

08:57.838 --> 08:59.773
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO
WITH THESE TICKETS NOW

08:59.807 --> 09:01.875
JUST SITTING HERE,
TAKING UP EMPTY SPACE?

09:04.344 --> 09:06.680
MAYBE I'LL JUST RECYCLE THEM.

09:06.714 --> 09:09.650
( deep voice ) THIS YOUR I.D., YOUNG MISS?
WHAT YEAR WERE YOU BORN?

09:09.683 --> 09:12.620
- UM...
- NO, OUT YOU GO, GIRLIE! NO CONCERT FOR YOU.

09:12.653 --> 09:14.788
- BUT...
- NO NO NO, THERE'S NO ROOM FOR BUTS.

09:14.822 --> 09:16.857
YOU NEED TO KNOW
THIS STUFF COLD.

09:16.890 --> 09:19.993
IF A BOUNCER SENSES HESITATION, HE WILL
STRIKE LIKE A BEAR AT AN UNDERAGE SALMON.

09:20.027 --> 09:22.362
( deep voice ) ALL RIGHT,
WHAT SCHOOL DO YOU GO TO?

09:22.395 --> 09:25.699
GRANT HI-OHIO STATE.

09:25.733 --> 09:27.735
MM, NICE SAVE. OKAY.

09:27.768 --> 09:29.737
- LET'S WORK ON THE WALK.
- THE WALK?

09:29.770 --> 09:32.740
YES, CONFIDENCE,
SWAGGER, COJONES.

09:32.773 --> 09:34.642
WATCH ME.

09:36.877 --> 09:38.846
- GOT IT.
- NO NO, YOU DON'T GOT IT.

09:38.879 --> 09:41.581
YOU DON'T USE YOUR LEGS.
YOU WALK WITH YOUR FACE.

09:44.885 --> 09:47.755
OH MY G... ALL THESE YEARS
I'VE BEEN DOING IT WRONG.

09:49.189 --> 09:51.024
WELL, IT'S TOO LATE
FOR ME NOW, GIRLS.

09:51.058 --> 09:54.695
I THINK I'M JUST GONNA GO
OLD SCHOOL AND USE ME LEGS.

09:54.728 --> 09:57.030
WHERE ARE YOU HEADED?

09:57.064 --> 09:59.066
UH, OUT, YOU KNOW,
TO DO SOME STUFF.

10:01.201 --> 10:03.671
INNOCENT STUFF.

10:03.704 --> 10:05.673
I CAN'T BELIEVE I
RAN INTO YOU HERE.

10:05.706 --> 10:08.709
YEAH, THIS IS MY CLASSROOM.

10:08.742 --> 10:11.378
HUH. I GUESS IT IS, ISN'T IT?

10:11.411 --> 10:14.682
SO LOOK, UM, LAST
TIME I WAS HERE,

10:14.715 --> 10:16.884
I MAY HAVE GOTTEN A
LITTLE PASSIONATE.

10:16.917 --> 10:19.186
I WAS THINKING UNSTABLE.

10:19.219 --> 10:21.922
( laughs ) "UNSTABLE"!
I LIKE THAT.

10:21.955 --> 10:23.423
I LIKE THAT. THE POINT IS

10:23.456 --> 10:26.794
YOU GAVE RYDER AN "F" AND BECAUSE OF
THAT HE CAN'T PLAY ON THE SOCCER TEAM.

10:26.827 --> 10:28.929
ISN'T THERE ANYTHING HE CAN
DO TO BRING THAT GRADE UP?

10:28.962 --> 10:31.865
I DON'T KNOW... MAYBE
STOP PLAGIARIZING.

10:31.899 --> 10:34.201
THAT'S...

10:34.234 --> 10:37.437
VERY GOOD SOLID ADVICE. I WILL
DEFINITELY PASS THAT ALONG.

10:37.470 --> 10:40.741
OH, AND I'LL TELL HIM IT CAME FROM
YOU SO THAT NO ONE'S PLAGIARIZING.

10:40.774 --> 10:43.811
YOU KNOW, THERE'S ONE THING I DON'T GET.
ARE YOU RYDER'S

10:43.844 --> 10:45.445
UNCLE OR GUARDIAN

10:45.478 --> 10:48.716
OR JUST SOME GUY THAT
GETS HIM IN TROUBLE?

10:50.083 --> 10:51.852
MOSTLY THE LAST ONE.

10:54.021 --> 10:57.090
LOOK, IF YOU CAN'T CHANGE HIS GRADE,
I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND, ALL RIGHT?

10:57.124 --> 11:00.427
I'LL SEE YOU AROUND. OH,
ACTUALLY I ALMOST FORGOT...

11:00.460 --> 11:02.229
ON A TOTALLY UNRELATED MATTER,

11:02.262 --> 11:04.698
I HAPPEN TO HAVE THESE
TWO FLOOR SEATS

11:04.732 --> 11:06.800
TO THE SOLD-OUT KINGS
OF LEON CONCERT TONIGHT

11:06.834 --> 11:09.837
- THAT UNFORTUNATELY I CAN'T USE.
- I LOVE KINGS OF LEON.

11:09.870 --> 11:11.805
YEAH, SO MANY PEOPLE DO.

11:11.839 --> 11:14.842
YOU WOULDN'T BE INTERESTED IN
TAKING THESE TICKETS, WOULD YOU?

11:14.875 --> 11:17.845
- HOW MUCH YOU WANT FOR 'EM?
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

11:17.878 --> 11:21.248
I WOULD NEVER CHARGE RYDER'S
TEACHER FOR THESE TICKETS.

11:24.017 --> 11:26.019
ON AN UNRELATED MATTER,

11:26.053 --> 11:28.088
I MAY HAVE BEEN A LITTLE
TOO HARD ON RYDER.

11:29.790 --> 11:32.225
PEOPLE MAKE MISTAKES.

11:40.167 --> 11:42.002
- YO.
- HEY.

11:42.035 --> 11:43.837
HOW'D IT GO WITH MR. McKAY?

11:43.871 --> 11:46.774
I GOT SOME BAD NEWS, BUDDY.

11:46.807 --> 11:48.776
I COULDN'T GET YOUR
"C" BACK, SO...

11:48.809 --> 11:51.812
YOU'RE JUST GONNA HAVE TO
SETTLE FOR A "B+," BABY!

11:51.845 --> 11:53.814
WHAT? NO WAY.

11:53.847 --> 11:55.949
YEP. YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS?
NO MAKE-UP PAPER

11:55.983 --> 11:57.885
AND YOU'RE BACK ON THE SOCCER TEAM.
WHO DA MAN?

11:57.918 --> 11:59.987
- YOU DA.
- BOOM.

12:00.020 --> 12:03.924
UH, WAIT A MINUTE, JOE. YOU
DIDN'T BEAT HIM UP, DID YOU?

12:03.957 --> 12:06.894
WHAT? NO.I USED GOOD
OLD-FASHIONED PERSUASION.

12:06.927 --> 12:09.763
EXCHANGE OF GOODS AND SERVICES.

12:09.797 --> 12:13.767
BY THE WAY, IF HE THANKS YOU FOR A COUPLE
OF KINGS OF LEON TICKETS, JUST GO WITH IT.

12:13.801 --> 12:15.836
- HOW'D YOU GET THOSE?
- THEY'RE JUST THE TICKETS

12:15.869 --> 12:17.504
YOUR AUNT MEL AND
LENNOX COULDN'T USE.

12:17.537 --> 12:19.973
BUT THEY DID USE THEM! THEY'RE
AT THE CONCERT RIGHT NOW.

12:20.007 --> 12:21.975
CAN'T YOU SEE THE
TRAIL OF GLITTER?

12:22.009 --> 12:24.111
HOW? I TOOK THEM RIGHT
OFF THE PRINTER.

12:24.144 --> 12:27.214
THEY THOUGHT THOSE GOT THROWN
AWAY SO THEY PRINTED A NEW SET.

12:27.247 --> 12:30.550
WHICH MEANS THE TICKETS YOU GAVE
MY TEACHER ARE TOTALLY WORTHLESS.

12:30.583 --> 12:34.521
JUST LIKE MY PROSPECTS
FOR GRADUATING.

12:34.554 --> 12:36.890
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
LOOK LOOK LOOK, RELAX.

12:36.924 --> 12:39.827
AS LONG AS WE GET DOWN THERE AND EXPLAIN
EVERYTHING TO HIM, IT'LL BE FINE.

12:39.860 --> 12:42.996
- THERE'S NO REASON TO PANIC.
- THE SHOW STARTS IN 15 MINUTES.

12:43.030 --> 12:44.865
CRAP, LET'S MOVE.

12:52.239 --> 12:53.273
I.D.

12:55.142 --> 12:57.010
I SURE AS HELL DON'T
NEED TO SEE YOURS.

12:57.044 --> 13:00.914
- JUST THIS ONE.
- YOU COULDN'T JUST HUMOR ME FOR A SECOND, PAL?

13:02.149 --> 13:05.886
- UH, THIS IS WHEN YOU SHOW HIM YOUR I.D.
- I'M LOOKING.

13:05.919 --> 13:08.956
YEAH, THANKS FOR CARDING HER.
IT MAKES HER FEEL SO YOUNG.

13:08.989 --> 13:10.991
FOUND IT.

13:14.995 --> 13:17.130
WAIT A MINUTE.

13:17.164 --> 13:19.599
WE GOT THE SAME BIRTHDAY.

13:19.632 --> 13:23.303
MARCH 18th... PISCES! YOU DON'T
FOLLOW THROUGH ON PROJECTS EITHER.

13:23.336 --> 13:25.372
ENOUGH, LET'S GO. LET'S GO.

13:29.609 --> 13:33.881
- SO DO YOU SEE YOUR TEACHER?
- NO, I DON'T SEE ANYONE HERE WHO WANTS TO FLUNK ME.

13:36.016 --> 13:38.385
- TOO MUCH LIP GLOSS?
- UGH, TOO MUCH LIP GLOSS?

13:38.418 --> 13:41.855
LIKE THERE COULD BE SUCH A THING.
GIMME THAT.

13:41.889 --> 13:44.624
THE KIDS AT SCHOOL ARE GONNA BE SO
JEALOUS WHEN THEY HEAR ABOUT TONIGHT.

13:44.657 --> 13:46.393
THE COPS ARE RAIDING THE PLACE

13:46.426 --> 13:48.395
AND CHECKING EVERYONE
FOR FAKE I.D.s.

13:48.428 --> 13:50.163
A RAID? OH MY GOD.

13:50.197 --> 13:53.867
DON'T WORRY. YOURS WAS DONE BY A PRO.
WALLY IS A GENIUS.

13:53.901 --> 13:55.602
WALLY'S ON WASHINGTON?

13:55.635 --> 13:58.638
NO. MAYBE.WHY?

13:58.671 --> 14:01.875
THE COPS CAN SPOT HIS
I.D.s FROM A MILE AWAY.

14:01.909 --> 14:03.977
- WHAT?
- OKAY, DON'T LISTEN TO HER.

14:04.011 --> 14:06.379
WALLY'S WORK IS FLAWLESS-SSS...

14:06.413 --> 14:08.615
ALTHOUGH I DON'T THINK
YOU WEIGH 520 LBS.

14:08.648 --> 14:12.119
OH MY GOD, I'M GOING TO JAIL

14:12.152 --> 14:15.255
AND I'M WEARING BODY GLITTER!
THEY'RE GOING TO EAT ME ALIVE.

14:15.288 --> 14:17.891
SNAP OUT OF IT, OKAY?
YOU'RE WITH YOUR AUNT MEL.

14:17.925 --> 14:20.027
I'M NOT LETTING YOU GO DOWN FOR THIS.
COME ON.

14:20.060 --> 14:21.261
EXCUSE ME.

14:21.294 --> 14:23.663
OKAY, SHOES OFF.

14:23.696 --> 14:26.266
GET UP ON THE TOILET. INTERLOCK
YOUR ARMS WITH MINE.

14:26.299 --> 14:30.103
- AND CROUCH.
- CAN'T WE PUT DOWN THE PAPER SEAT-COVER THINGY?

14:30.137 --> 14:32.205
NO NO. NO TIME, UP UP.

14:34.207 --> 14:36.143
- ALL RIGHT, OKAY.
- HERE WE GO.

14:36.176 --> 14:39.947
I ONCE DID THIS FOR SIX HOURS
IN STILETTOS FOR ACE OF BASE.

14:39.980 --> 14:42.082
IT WAS SO WORTH IT.

14:43.716 --> 14:46.386
ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
LET'S SEE YOUR I.D.s.

14:46.419 --> 14:48.922
THIS IS REALLY GOOD
FOR THE GLUTES.

15:01.168 --> 15:03.203
ALL CLEAR. HOLD ON, HOLD ON!

15:03.236 --> 15:05.005
( splashes )

15:05.038 --> 15:06.239
I TOLD YOU TO HOLD ON.

15:06.273 --> 15:09.076
AW, THERE'S PEE
WATER ON MY FOOT.

15:09.109 --> 15:13.180
YEAH WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?
SUCK IT UP.

15:13.213 --> 15:15.715
YOU'RE RUNNING WITH THE BIG DOGS NOW.
COME ON.

15:15.748 --> 15:18.085
I.D.s PEOPLE, COME ON.
I NEED YOUR I.D.s.

15:18.118 --> 15:20.687
OKAY, UH... PLAN "C"!

15:20.720 --> 15:23.356
- WE'RE GOING OUT THE WINDOW.
- ARE YOU KIDDING?

15:23.390 --> 15:26.126
- AND JUMP FROM UP HERE?
- WELL YEAH!

15:26.159 --> 15:28.228
WHY DO YOU THINK IT
WASN'T PLAN "A" OR "B"?

15:28.261 --> 15:30.263
COME ON.

15:33.133 --> 15:35.135
- HEY, THERE HE IS.
- OH!

15:35.168 --> 15:37.237
- MR. McKAY.
- HEY, GUYS.

15:37.270 --> 15:39.206
DUDE, LOOK, WE HAVE A
SLIGHT PROBLEM HERE.

15:39.239 --> 15:42.309
THOSE TICKETS THAT I GAVE YOU?
THEY'RE WORTHLESS, MAN.

15:42.342 --> 15:44.978
BUT I PROMISE YOU I AM GOING
TO MAKE IT UP TO YOU.

15:45.012 --> 15:47.114
PFFT, IT'S ALL GOOD. I SOLD
THEM TO SOME OTHER GUY.

15:47.147 --> 15:49.116
HIS PROBLEM NOW.

15:49.149 --> 15:52.119
- YOU SOLD THE TICKETS?
- HE OFFERED ME DOUBLE FACE VALUE.

15:52.152 --> 15:55.522
- LIKE I'M GONNA SAY NO.
- YEAH, SURE, JUST RIP OFF THE LITTLE GUY.

15:55.555 --> 15:57.290
HE GOT OUT OF A
BRAND-NEW MERCEDES.

15:57.324 --> 15:59.326
GUYS LIKE THAT, THEY CAN
AFFORD TO GET RIPPED OFF.

15:59.359 --> 16:01.995
IT'S ABOUT THE
MORALITY OF IT, DUDE.

16:02.029 --> 16:04.264
JOE, JOE, LET IT GO.

16:04.297 --> 16:07.300
- NO, THIS IS WRONG, RYDER.
- THAT'S KIND OF BEEN THE THEME HERE.

16:07.334 --> 16:10.137
I PLAGIARIZED, YOU BRIBED
WITH STOLEN TICKETS.

16:10.170 --> 16:13.140
YOU KNOW WHAT? THIS CRAP
IS GONNA STOP RIGHT NOW.

16:13.173 --> 16:16.209
SO WHAT'S IT GONNA BE, MR. TEACHER?
YOU GONNA SET AN EXAMPLE HERE?

16:16.243 --> 16:20.013
YOU HAVE A CHANCE TO MOLD A YOUNG MIND.
ISN'T THAT WHY YOU GOT INTO TEACHING?

16:21.181 --> 16:23.550
AW, MAN!

16:23.583 --> 16:26.153
- YOU'RE DOING THE RIGHT THING.
- DON'T TOUCH ME.

16:26.186 --> 16:27.287
OKAY.

16:28.288 --> 16:30.157
AUNT MEL, I'M SCARED.

16:30.190 --> 16:32.159
IT'S TOO FAR DOWN.

16:32.192 --> 16:36.096
NO, LOOK AT ALL THOSE NICE FLUFFY
GARBAGE BAGS DOWN IN THAT DUMPSTER.

16:36.129 --> 16:38.165
JUST THINK OF THEM AS
BIG COMFY PILLOWS.

16:38.198 --> 16:41.168
- IT'S TRASH.
- OKAY, BIG STINKY PILLOWS.

16:41.201 --> 16:43.436
COME ON, LENNOX. I'VE DONE
THIS A MILLION TIMES.

16:43.470 --> 16:46.106
- ( cheering from club )
- I CAN'T DO IT.

16:46.139 --> 16:48.408
OKAY, FINE, DON'T.

16:48.441 --> 16:50.510
I THOUGHT YOU COULD ROLL
WITH YOUR AUNT MEL.

16:50.543 --> 16:52.312
IF YOU CAN'T, WHATEVS.
IT'S FINE.

16:52.345 --> 16:55.215
- I DON'T THINK ANY LESS OF YOU...
- GOD, I CAN'T LISTEN TO THIS.

16:55.248 --> 16:57.317
- ( screams )
- LENNOX?

16:57.350 --> 16:59.186
WOW, YOU WERE RIGHT.

16:59.219 --> 17:01.088
IT'S REALLY SOFT AND...

17:01.121 --> 17:04.191
REALLY GROSS. COME ON, AUNT MEL.

17:04.224 --> 17:07.260
- YOUR TURN.
- OH HONEY, I DON'T HAVE TO JUMP.

17:07.294 --> 17:10.130
I'M OVER 30. I'LL
MEET YOU OUT FRONT.

17:10.163 --> 17:12.565
BUT I'M VERY PROUD OF YOU. OH...
HERE ARE YOUR SHOES.

17:14.201 --> 17:15.502
- OW!
- SORRY.

17:19.406 --> 17:21.374
THAT WAS STRANGE. I
JUST SAW SOME GIRL

17:21.408 --> 17:23.843
JUMP OUT OF THAT WINDOW INTO
THAT DUMPSTER THEN RUN AWAY.

17:23.876 --> 17:26.213
WHERE THE HELL ARE
THESE KIDS' PARENTS?

17:26.246 --> 17:28.481
HEY, THAT'S THE GUY.

17:28.515 --> 17:31.318
OH, SIR, HI. LISTEN,
MY FRIEND HERE

17:31.351 --> 17:33.353
HAS SOMETHING HE'D
LIKE TO TELL YOU.

17:33.386 --> 17:36.523
YEAH, MAN, THOSE TICKETS
I SOLD YOU ARE NO GOOD.

17:36.556 --> 17:39.259
NO BIG. I SOLD THEM
TO SOME OTHER SUCKER.

17:39.292 --> 17:40.493
WHO THE HELL DID
YOU SELL THEM TO?

17:40.527 --> 17:42.229
I PAID FOR THESE,
WHAT DO YOU MEAN...

17:42.262 --> 17:44.631
- HIM.
- HEY YOU!

17:44.664 --> 17:47.600
- NOT ME, HIM.
- I WANT MY MONEY!

17:47.634 --> 17:50.537
RYDER, I WANT 10 PAGES ON THE
REFORMATION FIRST THING MONDAY.

17:52.272 --> 17:54.174
- MONDAY?
- YOU'RE DEAD!

17:54.207 --> 17:57.844
RELAX, BUDDY. I ACED MY PAPER ON
THE REFORMATION IN COLLEGE...

17:57.877 --> 18:01.148
WHICH I'M NOT GOING TO BE SHOWING
TO YOU BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE WRONG.

18:02.415 --> 18:04.251
YOU'RE GONNA LOVE SUMMER SCHOOL.

18:04.284 --> 18:05.685
- DON'T TOUCH ME.
- OKAY.

18:07.654 --> 18:10.623
- WHEW!
- LENNOX, I FEEL BAD THAT YOU DIDN'T GET TO SEE THE CONCERT.

18:10.657 --> 18:15.262
I GOT TO HEAR IT. THAT FIRE
EXIT HAS GREAT ACOUSTICS.

18:15.295 --> 18:18.431
YEAH, BUT IT'S NOT EXACTLY WHAT I
HAD IN MIND FOR OUR BIG NIGHT OUT.

18:18.465 --> 18:20.367
YOU KNOW, DODGING THE COPS,
HIDING IN THE TOILET,

18:20.400 --> 18:22.635
- JUMPING IN THE TRASH.
- ARE YOU KIDDING?! IT WAS GREAT.

18:22.669 --> 18:27.174
I GOT TO DODGE COPS, HIDE IN A
TOILET AND JUMP INTO TRASH!

18:27.207 --> 18:29.309
WELL, WHEN YOU PUT IT THAT
WAY, IT WAS PRETTY FUN.

18:30.343 --> 18:32.179
OKAY, LET'S HUG LATER.

18:32.212 --> 18:35.348
- I SMELL LIKE GARBAGE?
- MMM, AND TOILET.

18:35.382 --> 18:36.683
( clears throat )

18:36.716 --> 18:40.420
SERIOUSLY, AUNT MEL,
TONIGHT WAS EPIC.

18:40.453 --> 18:41.554
FOR ME TOO.

18:41.588 --> 18:44.657
WOW! FUN AUNT MEL CAME THROUGH.

18:44.691 --> 18:46.559
HOW'D YOU GET HER INTO THE CLUB?

18:46.593 --> 18:48.595
OH PLEASE, I KNOW
A THING OR TWO.

18:48.628 --> 18:51.564
WELL, I WISH I HAD BEEN ABLE
TO DO HALF AS GOOD WITH RYDER.

18:51.598 --> 18:53.533
GO EASY ON YOURSELF, JOE.

18:53.566 --> 18:56.469
NOT EVERYONE CAN BE... WELL, ME.

18:57.737 --> 19:00.307
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? RYDER KNOWS
YOU TRIED YOUR HARDEST.

19:00.340 --> 19:02.242
AND I'M SURE HE
RESPECTS YOU FOR THAT.

19:02.275 --> 19:04.577
SCREW RESPECT. I JUST
WANT TO BE LIKED.

19:04.611 --> 19:06.313
- I KNOW, IT'S NICE, ISN'T IT?
- YEAH.

19:06.346 --> 19:08.581
BUT THE TRUTH IS, WELL,

19:08.615 --> 19:10.517
I WASN'T ABLE TO GET LENNOX...

19:12.552 --> 19:14.454
BACKSTAGE.

19:14.487 --> 19:17.224
SEE? I HAVE MY
LIMITATIONS AFTER ALL.

19:17.257 --> 19:19.192
BUT, YOU KNOW, THIS
PARENTING THING'S HARD

19:19.226 --> 19:21.361
- AND WE'RE BOTH STILL LEARNING.
- ( doorbell rings )

19:21.394 --> 19:23.496
I GOT IT.

19:25.498 --> 19:27.200
OFFICER! HOW CAN I HELP YOU?

19:27.234 --> 19:28.535
EVENING, COUNCILWOMAN BURKE.

19:28.568 --> 19:31.971
WE WERE AT A CALL AT THE KINGS OF
LEON CONCERT EARLIER THIS EVENING

19:32.004 --> 19:34.674
AND FOUND A FAKE I.D. OUT
BY ONE OF THE DUMPSTERS.

19:34.707 --> 19:37.744
THOUGHT YOU'D WANT TO KNOW THAT
SOMEONE'S PUTTING YOUR ADDRESS

19:37.777 --> 19:39.979
ON THEIR CARD... BIG GIRL.

19:40.012 --> 19:43.216
I HAVE NO IDEA HOW
THIS COULD HAPPEN.

19:43.250 --> 19:45.752
