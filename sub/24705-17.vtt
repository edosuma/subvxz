30:38.213 --> 30:39.362
-Lieutenant?
FANCY: Yeah?

30:39.533 --> 30:43.287
l have those work orders, and
maintenance is on line three.

30:43.453 --> 30:45.489
FANCY:
Thank you.

30:46.613 --> 30:48.444
Lieutenant Fancy.

30:48.613 --> 30:50.843
l'm staring at three work orders.

30:51.013 --> 30:55.529
l had a prisoner escape and an officer
injured because of you people.

30:55.693 --> 30:58.890
Now, l want these repairs
done by 1 2:00 tonight. . .

30:59.053 --> 31:01.328
. . .or l'm gonna have somebody's ass!

31:04.253 --> 31:06.130
EMS:
Look to the right.

31:06.293 --> 31:08.170
SlPOWlCZ: How you doing?
SHARON: l'm okay.

31:08.333 --> 31:14.090
l want a workup on every address Shabazz
has given every time we've arrested him.

31:14.253 --> 31:18.610
Check his old arrest reports for
telephone numbers he's given us.

31:18.773 --> 31:21.412
-And get the addresses.
-Hi, Mr. Butler.

31:21.573 --> 31:24.087
FANCY:
Okay, that's it.

31:24.253 --> 31:27.051
-Mr. Butler.
-What's going on here?

31:27.213 --> 31:29.647
Let's go into my office.

31:33.933 --> 31:36.163
Dead kid's father must be happy.

31:36.333 --> 31:40.485
Fancy called him and told him
we had the perpetrator in custody.

31:40.653 --> 31:43.645
-How's Mr. Bucci?
-This Pl's been working him.

31:43.813 --> 31:46.247
-He's set up for the blowoff.
-Yeah.

31:46.413 --> 31:48.927
-The verdict? How is she?
-l'm fine.

31:49.093 --> 31:51.891
There may be broken bones
under the eye.

31:52.053 --> 31:54.726
-l'm fine.
-Why don't you get it looked at?

31:54.893 --> 31:58.090
You'll be a half-member
of the raccoons club.

31:58.253 --> 32:04.362
-How long does the x-ray take?
-lf you're okay, a half-hour.

32:04.573 --> 32:08.043
l'm not gonna try to excuse
what happened here.

32:09.133 --> 32:12.125
You let the one who killed my son
get away.

32:12.293 --> 32:15.683
We'll pick him up.
He's got no resources, no money.

32:15.853 --> 32:20.005
There's a limited number of places
he can go. We'll pick him up.

32:20.173 --> 32:22.528
And l'm supposed to believe that?

32:22.813 --> 32:26.328
-lt's hard to put stock in this.
-l don't wanna hear it.

32:26.493 --> 32:30.281
l do not want to hear no more.
You understand, lieutenant?

32:31.893 --> 32:35.010
You told me the other day,
''Take it day by day. ''

32:35.173 --> 32:37.892
-That holds.
-That's what l'm gonna do.

32:38.053 --> 32:42.604
l know exactly how l'm going to be
spending my days and my nights.

32:42.773 --> 32:44.729
Mr. Butler, stay out of this.

32:44.893 --> 32:49.125
The world isn't so rich it can afford
to lose your boy and you.

33:08.733 --> 33:12.646
-Time for us to have a talk.
-What's on your mind, detective?

33:12.813 --> 33:15.885
-l've been to see the pink lady.
-l heard.

33:16.053 --> 33:19.329
-She said you're real dubious.
-l'm hurt by that.

33:19.613 --> 33:22.366
She told me you
came up with the blouse. . .

33:22.533 --> 33:25.889
. . .and that she lD'd it
off the emanations.

33:26.053 --> 33:28.886
-Let's say that's true.
-What's the next move?

33:29.213 --> 33:33.570
You tell the grieving father
how the guy that found the blouse. . .

33:33.733 --> 33:36.930
. . .at Salvation Army, or
whatever you come up with. . .

33:37.253 --> 33:40.768
. . .now he's sighted the girl
wandering around homeless. . .

33:40.933 --> 33:45.848
. . .with amnesia, but he's gonna need
big bucks to follow through?

33:46.013 --> 33:49.801
Then Mr. Bucci pays,
and the footprints peter out again?

33:49.973 --> 33:53.409
l'm a licensed Pl,
conducting an investigation.

33:53.573 --> 33:57.771
Every step that l take is approved
in advance by the client.

33:57.933 --> 34:00.811
-That's the bottom line here, Sipowicz.
-Wrong.

34:01.093 --> 34:04.403
Under that is,
l want a piece of this.

34:04.573 --> 34:08.565
A piece of what? l've been trying
to find the man's daughter.

34:08.733 --> 34:12.442
-l guess you'll ask for 50,000.
-lt's none of your business.

34:12.612 --> 34:17.208
Hey, if you're getting more,
God bless, but l want 25.

34:18.333 --> 34:20.051
You're full of crap.

34:20.493 --> 34:24.168
l'm telling you what l want
to let you make your play.

34:24.333 --> 34:30.283
Say for nuisance value, to reduce
the aggravation, l gave you. . .

34:30.733 --> 34:32.849
-. . .five?
-Say l bust your mouth?

34:33.013 --> 34:37.291
'Cause you're gonna say 25
with or without teeth.

34:38.172 --> 34:42.643
All right, say l gave you 25? But
for 25, you'd have to earn that.

34:42.813 --> 34:48.763
-lt's not to stay out of my way.
-l'm listening.

34:48.933 --> 34:51.003
You'd have to sell the old man.

34:51.213 --> 34:57.083
Tell him the blouse lead looks strong.
Prepare him if it might not work out.

34:57.653 --> 35:02.090
l don't want him giving up hope.
This is a well we're working here.

35:02.253 --> 35:05.131
lt's by no means dry.

35:05.653 --> 35:10.886
You prepared to earn your money?
He trusts you, you know.

35:11.053 --> 35:14.363
-l'll do my part. You do yours.
-You better do yours. . .

35:14.533 --> 35:18.685
. . .because you don't get your money
till he writes that check.

35:30.693 --> 35:35.244
CORDAY'S VOlCE: <i>Say l gave you 25? But</i>
<i>for that 25, you'd have to earn that.</i>

35:35.413 --> 35:39.008
-<i>lt's not to stay out of my way.</i>
SlPOWlCZ: <i>l'm listening.</i>

35:39.253 --> 35:41.289
CORDAY:
<i>You'd have to sell the old man.</i>

35:41.453 --> 35:46.402
<i>Tell him the blouse lead looks strong.</i>
<i>Prepare him if it might not work out.</i>

35:46.573 --> 35:50.930
<i>l don 't want him giving up hope.</i>
<i>This is a well we're working here.</i>

35:51.093 --> 35:53.482
<i>lt's by no means dry.</i>

35:55.493 --> 35:59.042
You want to file a criminal complaint
against this guy?

36:00.533 --> 36:02.171
No.

36:05.013 --> 36:10.133
You want me to say a few things out of
my experience as an outsider on this?

36:10.293 --> 36:12.329
Dom.

36:14.053 --> 36:17.250
l think that would be a good thing.

36:18.013 --> 36:20.652
Detective, please.

36:20.813 --> 36:25.603
You told me when Jenny disappeared,
you blamed yourself for sending her to. . .

36:25.773 --> 36:29.652
-. . .the bank with money from the store.
-l thought l was a big man.

36:29.813 --> 36:34.489
Everybody in the neighborhood
respected me. That would protect her.

36:34.653 --> 36:38.362
You feel like you might've cost
your daughter her life.

36:38.533 --> 36:40.091
Her life, yes.

36:40.333 --> 36:43.962
lf you could find her,
you could correct that mistake.

36:44.133 --> 36:46.408
But it doesn't work that way.

36:46.813 --> 36:53.082
l hate myself. l lie awake at night
sometimes doing that, you know?

36:53.253 --> 36:55.687
Yeah, l do know.

36:57.733 --> 37:00.042
You got to get on with your life.

37:00.213 --> 37:05.207
Take your time and money and do things
for yourself and for your wife. . .

37:05.373 --> 37:08.729
. . .for other people,
things that make you feel good.

37:08.893 --> 37:12.727
Then, if your daughter does show up,
it'll be a blessing.

37:12.893 --> 37:17.091
And if she doesn't. . .

37:18.213 --> 37:21.523
. . .then you're doing
what you can to live.

37:22.493 --> 37:24.643
Maybe you're right.

37:24.813 --> 37:26.690
l don't know.

37:26.853 --> 37:30.892
Knowing doesn't happen all at once.
You gotta grow into it.

37:31.053 --> 37:35.649
-Think you might be able to do that?
-l'm gonna try.

37:36.213 --> 37:40.092
l really am gonna try, Angela.

37:40.253 --> 37:42.892
But that doesn't mean
you give up hope.

37:43.133 --> 37:46.170
-No.
BUCCl: No, you just, you. . . .

37:47.093 --> 37:53.487
l understand. l understand
what you're saying to me. l do.

37:54.453 --> 37:57.490
Mrs. Clarence?
This is Detective James Martinez.

37:57.653 --> 38:03.205
l spoke to you about Shabazz? l wanted
to check to see if you heard anything.

38:03.373 --> 38:07.161
ls this the Emergency Room?
This is Detective Lasalle.

38:07.333 --> 38:11.326
l wanted to see if you treated a
black male, 5'7'', 1 50 pounds. . .

38:11.493 --> 38:14.246
. . .for injuries might be related
to a fall?

38:15.253 --> 38:18.086
Yeah, l know.
l just wanted to check back.

38:18.253 --> 38:20.244
Thank you.

38:24.773 --> 38:28.129
Dispatcher? Yeah. Kelly.

38:28.293 --> 38:30.682
Well, put it over the air again.

38:30.853 --> 38:32.764
Let me make this simple. . .

38:32.933 --> 38:37.927
. . .any cabby that made a pickup
in the vicinity of the--

38:38.093 --> 38:43.451
Well, maybe somebody was on a break.
Right. Thank you.

38:43.613 --> 38:46.844
-Did he fall down a rat hole?
-He'd be comfortable.

38:47.013 --> 38:50.449
OFFlCER: Easy, Mr. Butler. Take it easy.
CALVlN: Move it.

38:55.493 --> 38:59.327
Get in it. Get in it!

39:00.213 --> 39:05.685
A friend of mine tipped me to a bridge,
where l find this piece of garbage.

39:05.853 --> 39:07.445
You did the right thing.

39:07.613 --> 39:14.086
CALVlN: l'm surprised he's still alive
myself. l did it for George, you know.

39:14.453 --> 39:16.808
l owe my son.

39:16.973 --> 39:21.251
This is how l taught him it should be,
and l can't betray my son. . .

39:21.413 --> 39:26.362
. . .by going against what l taught him.

39:26.733 --> 39:29.611
Your son would be proud of you now.

39:33.093 --> 39:35.971
Medavoy, Martinez,
take care of the prisoner.

39:36.133 --> 39:38.169
MEDAVOY:
Sure, lieutenant.

39:39.653 --> 39:42.531
MEDAVOY: Step out.
MARTlNEZ: All right, come on. Move it.

39:42.693 --> 39:46.163
All right, watch your step.
All right, let's go.

39:46.693 --> 39:50.003
All right, here we are.
Watch your step.

39:50.973 --> 39:54.124
SlPOWlCZ: Let's go.
-This is as pure a piece of entrapment. . .

39:54.293 --> 39:56.807
-. . .l've encountered.
-Shut your mouth.

39:56.973 --> 39:59.885
The bust won't hold.
You proposed the bribe.

40:00.053 --> 40:03.682
l say the bust will hold.
lf not, l've lost them before.

40:03.853 --> 40:09.166
But meanwhile, you're off the streets,
out of that man's life. Now sit down.

40:09.333 --> 40:10.766
Yeah.

40:10.933 --> 40:15.051
Probably trying to run
some game of your own.

40:15.213 --> 40:18.125
Trying to eliminate the competition.

40:19.133 --> 40:21.772
You know how l know
l'm evolving towards. . .

40:21.933 --> 40:25.130
. . .a higher planetary consciousness,
Corday?

40:25.293 --> 40:27.682
Just like your psychic friend said:

40:27.853 --> 40:31.528
l know l'm getting a better
planetary tool kit. . .

40:31.693 --> 40:35.083
. . .'cause l didn't just punch
your lights out.

40:46.253 --> 40:48.369
SHARON:
Lieutenant.

40:48.533 --> 40:51.172
-You got a minute?
FANCY: Yeah.

40:51.333 --> 40:55.531
On that Equal Employment job,
l guess l've decided to take it.

40:55.693 --> 40:58.924
-All right.
-Yeah, it's important work, and the two. . .

40:59.093 --> 41:03.883
. . .kids waiting for me nights, they own
more of me than when Danny was alive.

41:04.173 --> 41:09.247
l've got respect for how you've carried
yourself, from the day you got here.

41:09.413 --> 41:11.688
Some day that was, huh?

41:12.093 --> 41:17.611
Yeah. l'll miss having you in my
command, and l'll miss you personally.

41:17.973 --> 41:22.251
Thanks. Can you keep the door open,
in case l have second thoughts?

41:22.413 --> 41:26.611
Sure. Given your new job, would l be on
thin ice if l hugged you?

41:26.773 --> 41:29.128
You better give me a hug.

41:29.293 --> 41:30.487
Good luck.

41:30.653 --> 41:33.451
Thanks. Thanks, lieutenant.

41:35.373 --> 41:39.605
Officer Licalsi, l made a call to
Special Victims like you asked.

41:39.773 --> 41:43.766
-What'd you find out?
-They didn't feel you came off great.

41:43.933 --> 41:47.812
-What'd l do wrong?
-lt's not like you did anything wrong.

41:47.973 --> 41:52.330
They just felt the way you carry
yourself isn't a manner that would. . .

41:52.493 --> 41:55.451
. . .inspire a woman who was raped
to confide in you.

41:55.613 --> 42:01.085
l don't know if it's fair. l spoke to a
panel, not somebody who'd been raped.

42:01.253 --> 42:06.281
l think what the feeling was is, what
makes you a good street cop. . .

42:06.453 --> 42:10.412
. . .can work against you
when you deal with a rape victim.

42:10.573 --> 42:14.964
lt's not hopeless. You work on
your presentation, you go back over.

42:15.293 --> 42:19.844
-You agree with their evaluation?
-l don't know you well enough to say. . .

42:20.013 --> 42:23.323
. . .but empathy is something that
you can work on.

42:23.493 --> 42:27.805
There's skills you can develop.
l'd be happy to work with you.

42:27.973 --> 42:30.487
lf you'd like that, call me at OEEO.

42:30.653 --> 42:34.487
-You're transferring?
-Yeah, as of Thursday.

42:35.333 --> 42:37.893
l'll call you, and give you my number.

42:38.053 --> 42:42.046
-Great. Thanks a lot.
-No problem.

42:43.493 --> 42:46.769
-Feel like a few club sodas?
-l'm off the stuff. . .

42:46.933 --> 42:49.163
. . .but l could go for a soft drink.

Dominic Bucci on line two for you.

42:57.493 --> 43:02.487
l think we're gonna be postponing
this rampage to another night.

43:03.493 --> 43:06.963
Yeah, Mr. Bucci. Yeah, how are you?

43:07.133 --> 43:12.161
What kind of possible development?
Where are you?

43:12.333 --> 43:14.244
Yeah.

43:15.053 --> 43:17.169
All right.

43:19.493 --> 43:20.482
KELLY: Hey.
SHARON: Hey.

43:20.653 --> 43:23.884
How does making dinner for you
and the boys sound?

43:24.053 --> 43:26.772
-Great. Great.
-Good.

43:26.933 --> 43:28.924
l'm gonna take that job.

43:29.093 --> 43:32.403
Good for you. Good for you.

43:33.013 --> 43:35.322
l'm gonna miss you, Johnny.

43:35.493 --> 43:39.532
-Thank you for helping me along.
KELLY: Hey, come on.

43:39.693 --> 43:43.891
You are changing tax brackets,
not your friends. Right?

43:46.213 --> 43:51.333
-Right. l'm gonna go get my coat.
-All right. l'll be here.

44:03.853 --> 44:06.811
BUCCl: Thanks for coming.
-Yeah. What's going on?

44:06.973 --> 44:09.441
Well, l was walking. . . .

44:09.613 --> 44:14.687
Now, here's the thing.
Here's the reason l contacted you.

44:14.853 --> 44:17.048
Detective. . .

44:18.253 --> 44:23.532
. . .l swear l heard her voice coming
from that apartment right there. . .

44:23.693 --> 44:26.605
. . .the one on the ground floor
with the lights.

44:26.773 --> 44:29.571
-l know how this must sound.
-Mr. Bucci.

44:29.733 --> 44:34.648
l'm asking you, please, detective,
just do this for me.
