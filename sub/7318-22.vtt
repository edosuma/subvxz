WEBVTT

00:12.267 --> 00:14.833
PREVIOUSLY
ON "GREY'S ANATOMY"...

00:14.867 --> 00:16.367
I TOLD THATCH I'M LEAVING HIM.

00:16.400 --> 00:18.267
YOU LEFT THATCHER, ELLIS.

00:18.300 --> 00:20.167
IF YOU COULD JUST HOLD--
I'M IN THE MIDDLE
OF MY WORKDAY, THATCH.

00:20.200 --> 00:21.600
THATCH?

00:21.633 --> 00:23.433
I LOOK LIKE MEREDITH'S DAD?

00:23.467 --> 00:25.767
WHY DIDN'T YOU STAY
AND FIGHT FOR US?

00:25.800 --> 00:27.700
WHY DIDN'T YOU TRY HARDER?

00:27.733 --> 00:29.133
I JUST SAW MY FATHER FOR
THE FIRST TIME IN 20 YEARS.

00:29.167 --> 00:30.600
I SLEPT WITH GEORGE.

00:30.633 --> 00:33.267
CAN WE PLEASE JUST GO BACK
TO EVERYTHING THE WAY IT WAS?

00:33.300 --> 00:34.767
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO GO BACK.

00:34.800 --> 00:38.100
AT SOME POINT, YOU ARE GOING TO
HAVE TO TALK TO ME.

00:38.133 --> 00:40.533
WANT TO SEE SOMETHING
REALLY COOL?

00:40.567 --> 00:42.200
***

00:42.233 --> 00:43.567
(man) NICE!

00:43.600 --> 00:45.200
(Meredith)
A GOOD BASKETBALL GAME

00:45.233 --> 00:47.600
CAN HAVE US ALL
ON THE EDGE OF OUR SEATS.

00:47.633 --> 00:51.733
GAMES ARE ALL ABOUT THE GLORY,
THE PAIN AND THE PLAY-BY-PLAY.

00:51.767 --> 00:54.300
AND THEN THERE ARE
THE MORE SOLITARY GAMES...

00:54.333 --> 00:56.633
DUDE...

00:56.667 --> 00:58.033
IS SHE KNITTING?

00:58.067 --> 01:00.500
THE GAMES WE EACH PLAY
ALL BY OURSELVES.

01:00.533 --> 01:02.433
(sighs) YOU KNOW, AS A--
AS A FRIEND,

01:02.467 --> 01:04.833
I GOTTA TELL YOU,
YOU LOOK A LITTLE WEIRD.

01:04.867 --> 01:06.300
I AM MAKING A SWEATER.

01:06.333 --> 01:07.667
YOU'RE KNITTING...
IN A BAR.

01:07.700 --> 01:09.700
YOU CAN'T KNIT IN A BAR.
YOU'RE SCARING THE CUSTOMERS.

01:09.733 --> 01:11.267
COME ON. HAVE A DRINK.

01:11.300 --> 01:13.767
I CAN'T HAVE A DRINK.
I'M CELIBATE.
(crowd cheers)

01:13.800 --> 01:16.167
YOU MEAN SOBER?
SHE MEANS SOBER.

01:16.200 --> 01:17.700
NO, CELIBATE.

01:17.733 --> 01:19.067
I'M PRACTICING CELIBACY,

01:19.100 --> 01:20.833
AND DRINKING DOES NOT GO WELL
WITH CELIBACY

01:20.867 --> 01:22.767
BECAUSE IT MAKES EVERYTHING
AND EVERYONE

01:22.800 --> 01:24.467
SEEM KIND OF PORN-Y,

01:24.500 --> 01:26.400
AND THEN MY HEAD GETS
ALL CLOUDY,

01:26.433 --> 01:28.333
AND THEN THE NEXT THING
YOU KNOW, I'M NAKED.

01:28.367 --> 01:30.267
AND MY POINT IS,
I'M CELIBATE,

01:30.300 --> 01:32.200
AND KNITTING IS GOOD
FOR SURGICAL DEXTERITY,

01:32.233 --> 01:34.067
SO I'M MAKING A SWEATER.

01:34.100 --> 01:36.467
YOU CELIBATE?
I JUST DON'T BUY IT.

01:36.500 --> 01:37.833
NO MORE MEN.

01:37.867 --> 01:39.800
NO MORE MEN, REALLY?

01:39.833 --> 01:42.700
YOU? AND I'M ASKING
BECAUSE WE ARE FRIENDS.

01:42.733 --> 01:45.567
EVERY GUY I MEET
TURNS OUT TO BE MARRIED...

01:45.600 --> 01:47.167
OOH, OUCH.
SORRY.

01:47.200 --> 01:48.533
OR MARK...

01:48.567 --> 01:50.633
OKAY, I'M GONNA GO
OVER THERE NOW.
SORRY.

01:50.667 --> 01:54.267
OR REMEMBER THE HORRIBLE THING
I DID? REMEMBER GEORGE?

01:54.300 --> 01:55.733
***

01:55.767 --> 01:57.267
YOU'RE MAKING A SWEATER.

01:57.300 --> 01:59.067
I AM MAKING A SWEATER.

01:59.067 --> 02:01.267
THE SOCIAL GAMES,
THE MIND GAMES--

02:01.300 --> 02:04.167
WE USE THEM TO PASS THE TIME,
TO MAKE LIFE MORE INTERESTING,

02:04.200 --> 02:07.667
TO DISTRACT US
FROM WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON.

02:07.700 --> 02:09.600
HE'S NOT GEORGE ANYMORE.
HE'S BROKEN GEORGE.

02:09.633 --> 02:11.533
FIRST HE CHOPS OFF HIS HAIR,

02:11.567 --> 02:14.433
THEN HE STARTS HANGING OUT
WITH THIS CALLIE.

02:14.467 --> 02:16.533
THAT IS NOT A NAME--CALLIE.
WHO IS SHE ANYWAY?

02:16.567 --> 02:18.200
I'M HIS BEST FRIEND.

02:18.233 --> 02:20.133
NOT THAT
HE TALKS TO ME ANYMORE.

02:20.167 --> 02:23.133
TRIPLE WORD SCORE.
69 POINTS.

02:23.167 --> 02:25.100
WOMAN, I'M BEATING
THE PANTS OFF YOU.

02:25.133 --> 02:27.067
PAY ATTENTION.
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOIN'?

02:27.067 --> 02:28.667
I'M KNITTING A SWEATER.

02:28.700 --> 02:30.667
ACTUALLY, MEREDITH--
THAT'S MY FRIEND,

02:30.700 --> 02:33.500
THE FRIEND THAT BROKE GEORGE--
SHE IS KNITTING A SWEATER.

02:33.533 --> 02:35.067
SHE'S NOT REALLY
KNITTING A SWEATER

02:35.067 --> 02:36.400
BECAUSE SHE CANNOT KNIT.

02:36.433 --> 02:38.700
BUT I WANT HER TO THINK
SHE IS KNITTING A SWEATER

02:38.733 --> 02:40.667
BECAUSE SHE AND I TOOK
A CELIBACY VOW

02:40.700 --> 02:42.600
SO SHE'S REPLACING SEX
WITH KNITTING,

02:42.633 --> 02:45.233
AND SO I AM KNITTING PIECES
OF MEREDITH'S SWEATER

02:45.267 --> 02:47.367
SO THAT I CAN
SWITCH THEM OUT WITH HERS

02:47.400 --> 02:49.233
SO THAT SHE CAN REALLY BELIEVE
SHE IS KNITTING.

02:49.267 --> 02:51.833
'CAUSE IF ANYBODY NEEDS
TO BE CELIBATE, IT'S MEREDITH

02:51.867 --> 02:52.800
'CAUSE SHE BROKE GEORGE,
YOU KNOW?

02:52.833 --> 02:55.300
YOU TOOK A VOW OF CELIBACY?
YES.

02:55.333 --> 02:56.800
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO GET
IN YOUR PANTS

02:56.833 --> 02:57.933
IF YOU TOOK
A VOW OF CELIBACY?

02:57.967 --> 03:00.400
THAT IS A VERY INAPPROPRIATE
THING TO SAY TO YOUR DOCTOR.

03:00.433 --> 03:01.633
OH, YOU KNOW
WHAT'S INAPPROPRIATE?

03:01.667 --> 03:03.567
PROMISING SEXUAL FAVORS
TO A PATIENT

03:03.600 --> 03:06.300
IN ORDER TO GET HIM TO LIVE
AND THEN BACKING OUT.

03:06.333 --> 03:08.533
DENNY DUQUETTE, I SO NEVER,
EVER PROMISED--

03:08.567 --> 03:11.067
IN MY HEAD, YOU DID.

03:11.067 --> 03:12.400
IN MY HEAD, YOU DELIVERED.

03:12.433 --> 03:13.467
WELL...

03:13.500 --> 03:16.367
BUT DON'T WORRY.

03:16.400 --> 03:17.733
YOU WEREN'T VERY GOOD.

03:17.767 --> 03:20.567
(laughs)

03:20.600 --> 03:22.467
(scoffs) OKAY.

03:22.500 --> 03:25.433
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I WAS BEING NICE.

03:25.467 --> 03:26.633
I WAS LETTING YOU WIN

03:26.667 --> 03:28.833
BECAUSE YOU'RE "MR. SICK
NEEDS A NEW ORGAN GUY,"

03:28.867 --> 03:31.167
BUT JUST FOR THAT COMMENT,

03:31.200 --> 03:33.167
I'M GONNA KICK YOUR ASS.

03:33.200 --> 03:36.300
YEAH, I'M GONNA...
YOU PUT DOWN "MOUNT," DENNY?

03:36.333 --> 03:38.500
THERE ARE THOSE OF US
WHO LOVE TO PLAY GAMES...

03:38.533 --> 03:40.067
(George) OKAY, UH...
ANY GAME.

03:40.100 --> 03:41.767
AND THEN THERE ARE
THOSE OF US

03:41.800 --> 03:44.133
WHO LOVE TO PLAY...

03:44.167 --> 03:46.533
NICE!
A LITTLE TOO MUCH.

03:46.567 --> 03:48.067
DISASTROUS FEMA DIRECTOR.

03:48.067 --> 03:49.433
UH...
(gasps)

03:49.467 --> 03:50.500
NO.
OH, UH...

03:50.533 --> 03:52.067
OH!
UH, UM...

03:52.067 --> 03:54.267
POO IS...
BROWN. POO IS BROWN.
MICHAEL BROWN!

03:54.300 --> 03:56.200
YES!
TIME! TIME!

03:56.233 --> 03:57.400
WHOO!

03:57.433 --> 03:59.467
(both) * AH, AH,
AH, AH, AH, AH, AH *

03:59.500 --> 04:02.100
* AH, AH,
AH, AH, AH, AH, AH *

04:02.133 --> 04:04.067
YEAH, THANK YOU.
IMPRESSIVE, O'MALLEY.

04:04.100 --> 04:06.400
(George) THANKS.
"POO IS?"

04:06.433 --> 04:09.533
APPARENTLY WE THINK ALIKE.
WOW. I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE PROUD OF THAT.

04:09.567 --> 04:12.400
HEY, ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO OPEN
THE PAPERS AHEAD OF TIME?
HEY!

04:12.433 --> 04:14.500
IT'S CALLED STRATEGY.
CRISTINA, IT'S A GAME.

04:14.533 --> 04:16.433
I KNOW THAT.
WELL, YOU JUST SEEM
A LITTLE INTENSE.

04:16.467 --> 04:18.800
WE'RE JUST TRYING TO HAVE
SOME FUN.
I'M HAVING FUN.

04:18.833 --> 04:21.400
LET'S DO THIS. OKAY.
ARE YOU READY?

04:21.433 --> 04:23.100
MM-HMM.
GO!

04:23.133 --> 04:24.433
BLONDE AMBITION TOUR.

04:24.467 --> 04:25.467
OH.

04:25.500 --> 04:27.333
BLONDE AMBITION TOUR.

04:27.367 --> 04:29.100
OH.

04:29.133 --> 04:31.200
"VOGUE."

04:31.233 --> 04:33.267
OH, ARE YOU KIDDING--
OKAY, SHE'S BLONDE.

04:33.300 --> 04:35.100
SHE'S A BLONDE,
SHE'S AMBITIOUS.

04:35.133 --> 04:37.667
SHE'S AMBITIOUS AND--AND WITH
THE TOUR AND THE VOGUEING

04:37.700 --> 04:40.367
AND--HONEY, LOOK AT ME.
OKAY, I AM--SHUT UP!

04:40.400 --> 04:42.333
CONES, CONES.
UH, BLONDE AMBITION.

04:42.367 --> 04:45.200
BOOB CONES AND--AND VOGUEING.
HONEY, VOGUEING.

04:45.233 --> 04:47.300
SEAN PENN! SEAN PENN!
TIME!

04:47.333 --> 04:50.267
(laughs)

04:50.300 --> 04:52.067
OH, MAN.

04:52.100 --> 04:54.367
ZERO POINTS FOR MADONNA.

04:54.400 --> 04:58.367
OH! MADONNA. RIGHT.

05:00.200 --> 05:01.533
WHO DOESN'T KNOW MADONNA?

05:01.567 --> 05:03.067
(sneezes) SORE LOSER.

05:03.100 --> 05:04.500
I AM NOT A SORE LOSER.

05:04.533 --> 05:06.600
YOU KNOW,
AND SO WHAT IF I AM?

05:06.633 --> 05:09.500
SEE, THE WHOLE POINT OF GAMES
IS THAT THERE IS A WINNER,

05:09.533 --> 05:11.300
A FIRST PLACE.

05:11.333 --> 05:13.233
YOU WANT A SECOND BEST SURGEON
OPERATING ON YOU? NO.

05:13.267 --> 05:14.467
YOU WANT THE VERY BEST.

05:14.500 --> 05:15.833
AND SECOND BEST IS MEDIOCRE.

05:15.867 --> 05:17.767
AND TO SETTLE FOR MEDIOCRITY
IS--IS...

05:17.800 --> 05:20.267
IT'S FRANKLY, YOU KNOW,
A SIGN OF SELF-LOATHING

05:20.300 --> 05:23.500
AND SUBSTANDARD WORK ETHICS.

05:23.533 --> 05:25.767
(sighs) I'VE GOTTA GET GEORGE
OUT OF MY APARTMENT.

05:25.800 --> 05:27.700
YOU KNOW,
YOU COULD SLEEP WITH HIM,

05:27.733 --> 05:29.633
AND THEN RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE,
START CRYING.

05:29.667 --> 05:31.467
IT'S PAINFUL AND HUMILIATING

05:31.500 --> 05:33.667
AND UNBELIEVABLY CRUEL,
BUT APPARENTLY,

05:33.700 --> 05:35.200
IT WORKS.

05:35.233 --> 05:36.567
WOULD YOU JUST KEEP KNITTING?

05:36.600 --> 05:39.067
KICK HIM OUT SO THAT HE CAN
COME BACK HOME TO US.

05:39.100 --> 05:40.833
NO, I-I CAN'T KICK HIM OUT.
HE'S BURKE'S PUPPY.

05:40.867 --> 05:42.367
IT'S GOTTA BE BURKE'S IDEA.

05:42.400 --> 05:45.767
I JUST GOTTA FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO MAKE HIM DO IT.

05:45.800 --> 05:47.700
(monitor beeps)

05:47.733 --> 05:50.700
GOT A LOT
OF METASTATIC DISEASE HERE.

05:50.733 --> 05:52.367
HOW DO WE PROCEED?

05:52.400 --> 05:54.300
DEFINITELY EXCISE
THE ENDOBRONCHIAL METS

05:54.333 --> 05:56.200
FOR SYMPTOMATIC PALLIATION.

05:56.233 --> 05:58.133
(chuckles)

05:58.167 --> 06:00.567
YOU'VE BEEN DOING
YOUR HOMEWORK, KAREV.

06:00.600 --> 06:02.500
A LOT OF LATE NIGHTS.

06:02.533 --> 06:03.767
LOOK AT THIS.

06:03.800 --> 06:06.067
THE METS HAVE ADHERED
TO HER CHEST WALL.

06:06.100 --> 06:07.833
DUDE, SHE'S TOAST.

06:07.867 --> 06:10.667
DON'T YOU THINK THAT'S
A LITTLE INSENSITIVE,

06:10.700 --> 06:12.167
DR. KAREV?

06:12.200 --> 06:13.567
SHE CAN'T HEAR ME.

06:13.600 --> 06:15.067
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

06:15.100 --> 06:16.833
BEDSIDE MANNER
IS PART OF THE JOB, KAREV.

06:16.867 --> 06:18.767
LATE NIGHTS
WON'T GET YOU ANYWHERE

06:18.800 --> 06:21.533
IF YOU CAN'T FIGURE THAT OUT.

06:21.567 --> 06:23.100
THANK YOU.
GOOD MORNING.

06:23.133 --> 06:25.067
HEY, YOU GOIN' INTO SURGERY
OR COMIN' OUT?

06:25.067 --> 06:26.800
GOIN' IN. I HAD TO
PUSH IT BACK. DOC'S SICK.

06:26.833 --> 06:28.733
DOC'S SICK?
WHAT ARE HIS SYMPTOMS?

06:28.767 --> 06:30.667
POLYDIPSIA, LETHARGY
AND VOMITING.
ANY SIGN OF FEVER
OR DEHYDRATION?

06:30.700 --> 06:32.167
UH, IT'S UNCLEAR.

06:32.200 --> 06:34.100
I WAS CONSIDERING RUNNING
A COURSE OF I.V. ANTIBIOTICS

06:34.133 --> 06:35.500
AND A SALINE DRIP.
SERIOUSLY?

06:35.533 --> 06:38.367
NO, ADDISON, HE'S A DOG.
I DROPPED HIM OFF AT THE VET.

06:38.400 --> 06:40.300
THEY'RE GONNA RUN SOME TESTS
AND OBSERVE HIM OVERNIGHT.
(pager beeps)

06:40.333 --> 06:41.400
MEREDITH WILL
CHECK ON HIM TONIGHT.

06:41.433 --> 06:43.267
I GOTTA RUN. I GOT A TRANSFER
IN FROM MERCY WEST.

06:43.300 --> 06:45.633
WILL YOU WAIT FOR ME
TO GO HOME?
YEAH.

06:45.667 --> 06:47.833
TODAY WE'LL BE COVERING--
YES.

06:47.867 --> 06:50.367
CRISTINA YANG,
FIRST YEAR SURGICAL INTERN.

06:50.400 --> 06:52.300
I'M JUST WONDERING
IF WE'RE GOING TO BE COVERING

06:52.333 --> 06:54.700
BOTH INTRA AND EXTRACORPOREAL
KNOTS TODAY IN THE SEMINAR.

06:54.733 --> 06:56.333
WE'LL BE TRAINING

06:56.367 --> 06:58.533

06:58.567 --> 07:00.067
STARTING WITH BASIC
INSTRUMENTATION

07:00.067 --> 07:01.800
AND CAMERA OPERATION...
DR. YANG.

07:01.833 --> 07:04.367
CHIEF.
WE'LL MOVE THROUGH
SEVERAL COMPLEX PROCEDURES,

07:04.400 --> 07:05.567
INCLUDING TISSUE APPROXIMATION.

07:05.600 --> 07:08.500
THE SUGGESTED TASK TIME
FOR BEAD TRANSFER IS...

07:08.533 --> 07:10.167
YOU'RE TAKING THE CLASS?

07:10.200 --> 07:11.567
IT'S A GOOD REFRESHER COURSE.
SHOULD BE FUN.

07:11.600 --> 07:13.500
AND 240 SECONDS FOR DOMINANT

07:13.533 --> 07:14.833

07:14.867 --> 07:19.200
NOW WHO WOULD LIKE TO VOLUNTEER
FOR OUR FIRST...

07:19.233 --> 07:21.233
DR. YANG.

07:21.267 --> 07:23.700
MOLLY THOMPSON, 22 YEARS OLD,
32 WEEKS PREGNANT.

07:23.733 --> 07:25.467
TRANSFERRED HERE
FROM MERCY WEST

07:25.500 --> 07:27.433
WHEN AN ULTRASOUND DIAGNOSED
THE BABY

07:27.467 --> 07:29.367
WITH CONGENITAL
DIAPHRAGMATIC HERNIA.

07:29.400 --> 07:31.567
HELLO, MOLLY.
I'M DR. ADDISON SHEPHERD.

07:31.600 --> 07:33.500
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
THE BEST.

07:33.533 --> 07:35.433
AND NOT TO PUT ANY PRESSURE
ON YOU OR ANYTHING,

07:35.467 --> 07:38.367
BUT THIS IS MY BABY
CARRYING MY GRANDCHILD,

07:38.400 --> 07:39.800
SO I REALLY HOPE
THAT YOU ARE.

07:39.833 --> 07:41.200
THE BEST, I MEAN.

07:41.233 --> 07:43.567
MOM, YOU'RE KIND OF
THREATENING THE DOCTOR.

07:43.600 --> 07:45.600
DON'T THREATEN THE DOCTOR.
IT DOESN'T HELP.
SORRY.

07:45.633 --> 07:47.200
MY HUSBAND TELLS ME
I HAVE TO TRY

07:47.233 --> 07:48.600
NOT TO BE
SUCH A MOTHER LION

07:48.633 --> 07:50.100
BECAUSE MOLLY'S A GROWN WOMAN

07:50.133 --> 07:52.400
AND HAS HER OWN LIFE
AND EVERYTHING,

07:52.433 --> 07:54.500
BUT... ROAR.

07:54.533 --> 07:56.433
(chuckles) IT'S OKAY.
I CAN TAKE IT.

07:56.467 --> 07:58.133
I AM THE BEST.

07:58.167 --> 08:00.367
YOU CAN FIX THIS,
THOUGH, RIGHT?

08:00.400 --> 08:02.067
WE'LL INSERT A SCOPE
INTO YOUR UTERUS

08:02.100 --> 08:03.267
AND THEN INFLATE
A LITTLE BALLOON

08:03.300 --> 08:04.767
IN THE BABY'S AIRWAY,

08:04.800 --> 08:06.733
WHICH SHOULD HELP STIMULATE
THE LUNGS TO GROW.

08:06.767 --> 08:09.267
IT'S NOT GONNA BE EASY
ON EITHER OF YOU,

08:09.300 --> 08:13.067
BUT I DO HAVE A STRONG RECORD
WITH THIS SURGERY.

08:13.100 --> 08:14.833
MAKE SURE YOU GET HER
TO THE M.R.I.

08:14.867 --> 08:17.333
AND GET ME THE RESULTS
AS SOON AS YOU CAN.

08:17.367 --> 08:19.433
I WILL.
OH, EXCUSE ME.

08:23.100 --> 08:25.367
SIR, CAN I HELP YOU
FIND SOMETHING?

08:25.400 --> 08:28.067
UH... IS--

08:28.100 --> 08:30.800
IS THERE A DR. MEREDITH GREY
WORKING TODAY?

08:30.833 --> 08:32.633
YES.

08:32.667 --> 08:34.833
SH-SHE'S HERE
IN THE HOSPITAL RIGHT NOW?

08:34.867 --> 08:37.733
I CAN HAVE SOMEONE PAGE HER
FOR YOU IF YOU WANT ME TO.

08:37.767 --> 08:39.700
NO. NO. THAT'S...

08:39.733 --> 08:42.300
THANK YOU.

08:42.333 --> 08:43.567
WAIT. EXCUSE ME. SIR?

08:43.600 --> 08:46.633
ARE--ARE YOU--
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

08:46.667 --> 08:48.167
THATCHER.

08:48.200 --> 08:49.133
YOU'RE...

08:49.167 --> 08:50.533
GREY, YEAH.

08:50.567 --> 08:52.733
YOU'RE MEREDITH'S FATHER.

08:52.767 --> 08:54.133
YEAH.

08:54.167 --> 08:57.067
ARE YOU SURE YOU DON'T
WANT ME TO PAGE HER FOR YOU?

08:57.067 --> 08:58.800
NO. I'M SORRY.
IT'S COMPLICATED.

08:58.833 --> 09:00.733
THATCHER, HONEY.

09:00.767 --> 09:02.500
WE'RE RIGHT HERE.
OH.

09:02.533 --> 09:04.300
OH, THERE YOU ARE, SUSAN.

09:04.333 --> 09:06.233
DID YOU TELL HIM?
I ROARED A LITTLE.

09:06.267 --> 09:07.600
I COULDN'T HELP IT.

09:07.633 --> 09:10.433
OH. OH, WELL,
I KNEW YOU WOULD.

09:10.467 --> 09:11.400
UH...

09:11.433 --> 09:13.100
I'M SORRY.
I'M DR. O'MALLEY.

09:13.133 --> 09:14.300
I'M, UH, O'MALL--

09:14.333 --> 09:16.767
I--WELL, EXCUSE US.

09:16.800 --> 09:20.133
UH, WE'RE GONNA CHECK
ON OUR DAUGHTER.

09:32.600 --> 09:35.400
AH, DR. BAILEY!
DO YOU HAVE AN EXTRA INTERN?

09:35.433 --> 09:38.300
I'M AVAILABLE.
NO, NO, NO, NO.
I SAID "INTERN."

09:38.333 --> 09:40.100
SHEPHERD, LOOK AT THE BOARD.

09:40.133 --> 09:41.233
OKAY. WHAT AM I LOOKIN' AT?

09:41.267 --> 09:42.767
MY NAME ISN'T UP THERE.

09:42.800 --> 09:44.700
IT WASN'T UP THERE YESTERDAY
AND IT WON'T BE TOMORROW.

09:44.733 --> 09:46.633
WHAT'D YOU DO,
PISS OFF THE CHIEF?
YEAH, I PISSED OFF
THE CHIEF.

09:46.667 --> 09:48.567
I WENT AND HAD A BABY.
I GAVE BIRTH.

09:48.600 --> 09:49.800
I CREATED A HUMAN LIFE.

09:49.833 --> 09:51.600
I'M A SURGEON.
WE DON'T DO THAT.

09:51.633 --> 09:54.300
HE'S MOMMY-TRACKIN' ME.
HE'S JUST GOIN' EASY
ON YOU.

09:54.333 --> 09:56.767
NO. I CHANGE DIAPERS,
I-I CLEAN SPIT UP,

09:56.800 --> 09:59.500
I SING THE A-B-Cs--
I'M COVERED IN MOMMY.

09:59.533 --> 10:02.367
BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN
I WILL BE MOMMY-TRACKED.
YOU'RE FREAKING OUT.

10:02.400 --> 10:04.500
I JUST NEED A SURGERY.
I NEED A SURGERY NOW.

10:04.533 --> 10:06.467
SO FOR TODAY,
I'M YOUR INTERN.

10:06.500 --> 10:08.233
I...

10:08.267 --> 10:11.233
I HAVE NOT BEGUN
TO FREAK OUT.

10:11.267 --> 10:12.700
ALL RIGHT, COME ON.

10:12.733 --> 10:15.833
CRISTINA TOLD ME THAT GEORGE
HAD A DATE WITH ORTHO CHICK.

10:15.867 --> 10:18.433
GAMES NIGHT. SHE DIDN'T EVEN
TAKE HIM HOME AFTERWARDS.

10:18.467 --> 10:20.500
SHE HINTED THAT SHE WANTED TO
AND THEN SAID SHE COULDN'T.

10:20.533 --> 10:21.700
THAT'S WEIRD, RIGHT?

10:21.733 --> 10:23.400
GEORGE MADE IT PERFECTLY CLEAR

10:23.433 --> 10:25.833
THAT I AM NOT
IN HIS LIFE ANYMORE.

10:25.867 --> 10:27.767
YOU THINK ORTHO CHICK
IS HIDING SOMETHING?

10:27.800 --> 10:29.300
SHE COULD BE HIDING SOMETHING.

10:29.333 --> 10:31.333
STEVENS... HOLD THIS.

10:32.867 --> 10:35.133
GEORGE MENTIONED
YOU'RE NOT BIG ON ORTHO.

10:35.167 --> 10:37.700
GREY, TAKE THE OSTEOTOME
AND THE MALLET.

10:37.733 --> 10:40.100
FOLLOW ME.

10:41.333 --> 10:45.567
(Alex) MS. CARVER,
UNFORTUNATELY WE FOUND

10:45.600 --> 10:47.500
THAT THE CANCER HAS METASTASIZED
TO YOUR CHEST WALL.

10:47.533 --> 10:50.400
WE TOOK OUT A SMALL TUMOR
OBSTRUCTING YOUR AIRWAY,

10:50.433 --> 10:52.367
WHICH WILL HELP
WITH YOUR BREATHING, BUT...

10:52.400 --> 10:55.133
IT'S NOT A CURE.

10:55.167 --> 10:58.100
SO THIS IS
THE END OF THE LINE?

10:58.133 --> 10:59.633
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE SAYING?

10:59.667 --> 11:01.667
THIS IS IT, I DIE NOW?

11:02.833 --> 11:05.333
BEATRICE...
I WANT YOU TO GO BACK IN.

11:05.367 --> 11:07.633
I WANT YOU TO CUT OUT
EVERYTHING THAT YOU CAN--

11:07.667 --> 11:09.500
AS MUCH AS YOU CAN.

11:09.533 --> 11:11.667
I WANT AS MUCH TIME AS YOU
CAN GIVE ME, YOU UNDERSTAND?

11:11.700 --> 11:14.067
WELL, UNFORTUNATELY,
ANY ADDITIONAL SURGERY IS--

11:14.067 --> 11:15.367
EXCUSE ME.

11:15.400 --> 11:17.733
MOM, I'M NOT EATING ANY OF
THAT CRAP IN THE CAFETERIA.

11:17.767 --> 11:20.367
I MEAN, WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO
ORDER IN THAI FOOD OR SOMETHING

11:20.400 --> 11:23.067
BECAUSE I'M STARVING
AND THE FOOD HERE BLOWS.

11:23.067 --> 11:25.767
I'LL HAVE THE NURSE
BRING A MENU BY

11:25.800 --> 11:27.767
AND WE CAN HAVE
A PICNIC IN BED.

11:27.800 --> 11:30.800
GOD, MOM. HOW MANY DOCTORS
DO YOU HAVE?

11:32.300 --> 11:33.500
THEY WERE JUST LEAVING.

11:33.533 --> 11:35.433
(man) AFTER TRAILING BY 10
AT THE HALF,

11:35.467 --> 11:37.367
THE OFFENSE STEPPED UP,
LEADING A 13-0 RUN

11:37.400 --> 11:39.767
TO BEGIN A SEESAW BATTLE
UP TO THE END.

11:39.800 --> 11:41.300
IN FIVE TO TEN YEARS,

11:41.333 --> 11:45.200
CUTTING AS WE KNOW IT
WILL BE VIRTUALLY OBSOLETE.

11:47.100 --> 11:48.233
VERY NICE, DR. YANG.

11:48.267 --> 11:50.067
THANK YOU, SIR.

11:54.367 --> 11:56.267
A LITTLE LESS TENSION THERE,
CHIEF.

11:56.300 --> 11:59.467
WATCH YOUR GRIP.
THERE YOU GO.

12:02.400 --> 12:04.333
I WASN'T COPYING YOU.

12:04.367 --> 12:06.533
OF COURSE NOT, SIR.

12:10.833 --> 12:12.533
DONE! I'M DONE.
I TOTALLY FINISHED FIRST.

12:12.567 --> 12:14.600
I'M DONE.

12:18.633 --> 12:20.400
SO, DR. TORRES...
HOLD IT STEADY, GREY.

12:20.433 --> 12:23.300
DID YOU ALWAYS KNOW YOU WANTED
TO SPECIALIZE IN ORTHOPEDICS?

12:23.333 --> 12:25.233
DID YOU ALWAYS KNOW
YOU WANTED TO MODEL?

12:25.267 --> 12:27.267
OH. OKAY.

12:27.300 --> 12:29.800
GREY, I MEAN IT.
WATCH YOUR GRIP.

12:29.833 --> 12:32.167
AND YOUR HUSBAND,
IS HE A DOCTOR, TOO?

12:32.200 --> 12:35.067
(scoffs) WHAT ARE YOU TRYING
TO ASK ME, DR. STEVENS,

12:35.100 --> 12:37.733
MY HISTORY, MY MARITAL STATUS,
MY DEEP, DARK LITTLE SECRETS?

12:37.767 --> 12:40.633
I'M GEORGE'S BEST FRIEND.

12:40.667 --> 12:42.567
OH, I SEE.
WELL, IT'S JUST FUNNY.

12:42.600 --> 12:45.233
'CAUSE FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND,
AS HIS BEST FRIEND,

12:45.267 --> 12:47.400
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN
THE BEST MATCHMAKER IN THE PAST.

12:47.433 --> 12:49.200
(bone cracks)

12:55.367 --> 12:56.300
HI.

12:56.333 --> 12:57.167
HEY.

12:57.200 --> 12:59.267
YOUR HAIR IS GROWING OUT,
WHICH IS NICE.

12:59.300 --> 13:01.833
I STILL THINK YOU SHOULD CUT IT.
I COULD CUT IT FOR YOU...

13:01.867 --> 13:03.400
IF WE STILL LIVED TOGETHER.

13:03.433 --> 13:06.633
OR WE COULD JUST HANG OUT
AND TALK ABOUT... STUFF,

13:06.667 --> 13:08.333
LIKE YOUR NEW FRIEND...

13:08.367 --> 13:09.567
CALLIE.

13:09.600 --> 13:13.567
SHE'S, UH...
SHE'S VERY, UM...

13:13.600 --> 13:16.100
YOU KNOW, IF YOU LIKE HER,
I WILL LIKE HER...

13:16.133 --> 13:17.067
EVENTUALLY.

13:17.100 --> 13:18.267
I CAN'T ESCAPE HER.

13:18.300 --> 13:19.233
WHAT?

13:19.267 --> 13:21.167
ALL I WANT TO DO
IS FORGET HER,

13:21.200 --> 13:23.100
ALL I WANT TO DO
IS JUST ESCAPE HER,

13:23.133 --> 13:24.633
AND, YOU KNOW, I CAN'T.

13:24.667 --> 13:26.133
YOU WANT TO ESCAPE CALLIE?

13:26.167 --> 13:27.667
OH, THANK GOD.

13:27.700 --> 13:29.600
'CAUSE SHE IS, LIKE,
A TOTAL FREAK,

13:29.633 --> 13:32.333
AND I WAS STARTING TO GET
REALLY WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

13:32.367 --> 13:36.300
NOT CALLIE.

13:36.333 --> 13:37.467
SORRY. (chuckles)

13:37.500 --> 13:38.433
OOPS.

13:38.467 --> 13:40.767
WHO? OR, OH...

13:40.800 --> 13:42.267
MEREDITH AGAIN.

13:42.300 --> 13:43.433
I'M GONNA
TELL YOU SOMETHING,

13:43.467 --> 13:46.333
AND THE MINUTE I TELL YOU
WHAT I'M ABOUT TO TELL YOU,

13:46.367 --> 13:48.533
THIS OFFICIALLY BECOMES
YOUR PROBLEM, NOT MINE.

13:48.567 --> 13:51.067
OKAY.

13:52.700 --> 13:54.700
MEREDITH HAS A SISTER.

13:56.600 --> 13:57.867
HOW ARE WE DOING?

13:57.900 --> 14:01.133
I TURNED THE SKULL FLAP.
PATIENT'S SEDATED.
(Derek) VERY NICE.

14:01.167 --> 14:03.300
NICELY DONE.

14:03.333 --> 14:06.167
HE--HE'S A KID.

14:06.200 --> 14:07.733
YES.

14:07.767 --> 14:09.667
I JUST DIDN'T THINK
IT WOULD BE A KID.

14:09.700 --> 14:12.133
A TUMOR THAT SIZE...
WELL, WHAT HAPPENS NOW?

14:12.167 --> 14:13.700
NOW WE WAKE HIM UP.

14:13.733 --> 14:16.400
WE'RE DOING
AWAKE BRAIN SURGERY ON HIM?

14:16.433 --> 14:17.767
YES. THANK YOU.

14:17.800 --> 14:20.600
ANDREW.

14:20.633 --> 14:22.500
A LITTLE MORE.

14:22.533 --> 14:25.267
ANDREW, CAN YOU HEAR ME?

14:26.433 --> 14:29.233
HEY. WANT TO COUNT
FOR ME?

14:29.267 --> 14:30.233
ONE...

14:30.267 --> 14:33.067
GOOD, KEEP GOING.

14:33.100 --> 14:35.733
TWO...

14:36.867 --> 14:38.233
THREE...

14:40.133 --> 14:42.067
(Derek) SINCE THE TUMOR
IS LOCATED

14:42.067 --> 14:43.800
NEAR THE LANGUAGE CENTER
OF THE BRAIN,

14:43.833 --> 14:45.733
IT'S IMPORTANT
THAT WE DON'T DAMAGE IT.

14:45.767 --> 14:47.267
ANDREW, I NEED YOU
TO KEEP TALKING.

14:47.300 --> 14:49.200
CAN YOU DO THAT?
CAN YOU TALK TO ME?

14:49.233 --> 14:50.333
I-I'LL TRY.

14:50.367 --> 14:52.533
OKAY, GREAT.
NOW WHAT GRADE ARE YOU IN?

14:52.567 --> 14:54.700
UM... SEVENTH.

14:54.733 --> 14:56.367
YOU INTO SPORTS?

14:56.400 --> 14:57.567
NOT REALLY.

14:57.600 --> 14:59.267
HOW ABOUT BASEBALL?

14:59.300 --> 15:04.233
UM... BASEBALL'S A SPORT.

15:04.267 --> 15:05.433
RIGHT.

15:05.467 --> 15:07.800
OKAY.
WHAT ABOUT, UH, GIRLS?

15:07.833 --> 15:10.133
DO YOU HAVE ANY GIRLFRIENDS?

15:10.167 --> 15:12.400
NO.

15:13.700 --> 15:16.733
UM... YOU PROBABLY
DON'T HAVE TIME

15:16.767 --> 15:19.133
FOR GIRLFRIENDS
RIGHT, ANDREW?

15:19.167 --> 15:20.500
PROBABLY TOO BUSY, RIGHT?

15:20.533 --> 15:22.067
Y-YES, MA'AM.

15:22.100 --> 15:23.833
UH, WHAT ARE YOU BUSY DOING?

15:23.867 --> 15:27.533
UM... GETTING READY
FOR THE NATIONAL SPELLING BEE.

15:27.567 --> 15:30.800
I WON THE GREATER REGIONALS
LAST MONTH.

15:30.833 --> 15:32.400
OH, WELL, IN THAT CASE,

15:32.433 --> 15:34.233
YOU NEED TO SPELL
SOME WORDS FOR US.

15:34.267 --> 15:35.433
UH, CAN YOU DO THAT?

15:35.467 --> 15:36.700
SURE.

15:36.733 --> 15:39.767
UH, GOOD. UH...

15:40.833 --> 15:43.133
YOU USUALLY PROVIDE
THE WORD, DR. BAILEY.

15:43.167 --> 15:45.067
I DON'T HEAR YOU
COMING UP WITH ONE.

15:45.100 --> 15:47.067
UH, LET'S SEE.

15:47.067 --> 15:50.367
ALL RIGHT, UH,
ACETAMINOPHEN.

15:50.400 --> 15:53.333
ACETAMINOPHEN.

15:53.367 --> 15:54.833
ORIGIN OF THE WORD?

15:54.867 --> 15:57.133
HECK IF I KNOW.

15:58.467 --> 16:00.633
HEY, DO YOU HAVE
MOLLY'S M.R.I. RESULTS?

16:00.667 --> 16:02.567
NO. I-I HAVEN'T--
NOT YET.

16:02.600 --> 16:04.500
WHAT THE HELL
HAVE YOU BEEN DOING THEN?

16:04.533 --> 16:05.833
I WAS JUST GONNA--

16:05.867 --> 16:08.333
WHEN I ASSIGN YOU
TO A CASE OF MINE,

16:08.367 --> 16:10.733
I EXPECT YOU TO GIVE IT YOUR
FULL AND UNDIVIDED ATTENTION.

16:10.767 --> 16:12.300
GIVE ME ONE GOOD REASON

16:12.333 --> 16:14.700
WHY I-I SHOULDN'T
TAKE YOU OFF THIS CASE.

16:14.733 --> 16:18.100
MOLLY THOMPSON'S MAIDEN NAME
IS GREY.

16:18.133 --> 16:19.467
HER FATHER IS THATCHER GREY.

16:19.500 --> 16:21.400
THATCHER GREY IS ALSO
MEREDITH'S FATHER,

16:21.433 --> 16:23.333
WHICH MEANS THAT MOLLY
AND MEREDITH ARE SISTERS,

16:23.367 --> 16:25.333
BUT I DON'T THINK MEREDITH
EVEN KNOWS MOLLY EXISTS.

16:25.367 --> 16:27.067
AND I DON'T CARE.
I DON'T.

16:27.100 --> 16:30.100
EXCEPT I'M ON THIS CASE
AND...

16:30.133 --> 16:32.333
APPARENTLY, GOD HATES ME.

16:32.367 --> 16:34.333
OKAY.

16:34.367 --> 16:36.367
OKAY, THANKS.

16:37.433 --> 16:39.333
I WANT ALL THIS OUT NOW.

16:39.367 --> 16:41.267
I'M GETTING OUT
OF THE HOSPITAL.

16:41.300 --> 16:43.200
OH, WE CAN'T, BEATRICE.
YOU JUST HAD MAJOR SURGERY.

16:43.233 --> 16:45.133
TOMORROW IS
MY DAUGHTER'S BIRTHDAY.

16:45.167 --> 16:47.233
APPARENTLY IT'S THE LAST ONE
I GET TO CELEBRATE,

16:47.267 --> 16:49.167
AND I'M NOT SPENDING IT
IN HERE.

16:49.200 --> 16:51.167
OKAY, I'M SO SORRY,
BUT IF WE REMOVE THIS TUBE,

16:51.200 --> 16:52.600
YOUR LUNG WILL COLLAPSE.

16:52.633 --> 16:53.833
I'M SURE YOU DON'T WANT
TO SPEND

16:53.867 --> 16:56.333
YOUR DAUGHTER'S BIRTHDAY
THIS WAY, OKAY?
I'M A QUICK HEALER.

16:56.367 --> 16:57.667
I'M BREATHING BETTER
SINCE THE SURGERY.

16:57.700 --> 16:59.600
THAT IS BECAUSE WE REMOVED
SOME OF THE TUMOR

16:59.633 --> 17:00.800
TO OPEN UP YOUR AIRWAY.

17:00.833 --> 17:03.367
THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU
ARE WELL, ALL RIGHT?

17:03.400 --> 17:05.300
IF YOU TRY TO LEAVE, YOU ARE
AT RISK OF INFECTION

17:05.333 --> 17:07.500
OR HEMORRHAGING.
YOUR KID DOESN'T EVEN KNOW
YOU HAVE CANCER.

17:07.533 --> 17:09.733
YOU REALLY WANT TO RISK
DROPPING DEAD ON THE STREET

17:09.767 --> 17:11.500
OUTSIDE THE HOSPITAL?

17:13.833 --> 17:15.767
DR. KAREV...

17:15.800 --> 17:18.633
SO YOU THOUGHT SCARING HER
BACK INTO BED

17:18.667 --> 17:20.133
WAS THE WAY TO GO?

17:20.167 --> 17:22.833
IT WORKED, DIDN'T IT?
SHE'S LYING TO HER KID.

17:22.867 --> 17:24.600
SHE'S FRIGHTENED.
SHE'S IN SHOCK.

17:24.633 --> 17:27.133
IT IS NOT YOUR JOB
OR YOUR PLACE

17:27.167 --> 17:30.067
TO TAKE A TONE LIKE THAT
WITH A PATIENT, NOT EVER.

17:30.067 --> 17:31.833
ARE WE UNDERSTOOD?

17:31.867 --> 17:34.133
YES, SIR.

17:34.167 --> 17:36.667
***

17:36.700 --> 17:39.100
SO WHAT ARE THE SISTER
AND THE FATHER LIKE?

17:39.133 --> 17:40.233
LIKE?

17:40.267 --> 17:42.167
THEY'RE LIKE PEOPLE
MEREDITH IS RELATED TO

17:42.200 --> 17:43.433
AND NEVER MET.

17:43.467 --> 17:45.667
THEY'RE NICE.
CAN YOU IMAGINE...

17:45.700 --> 17:49.633
A SISTER, A WHOLE FAMILY
YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT?

17:49.667 --> 17:51.567
YOU THINK SHE'S GONNA
FREAK OUT?

17:51.600 --> 17:54.400
IT'S NOT MY RESPONSIBILITY
TO CARE.

17:54.433 --> 17:56.100
OH, HEADS UP, HEADS UP.

17:56.133 --> 17:57.300
HEY, CHIEF.
HOW YOU DOIN'?

17:57.333 --> 17:59.433
SEEMS I'M A LITTLE RUSTY

17:59.467 --> 18:01.300
ON MY BEAD TRANSFER
AND ROPE PASS.

18:01.333 --> 18:04.667
DR. YANG HERE'S BEEN
KICKING MY ASS ALL DAY.

18:04.700 --> 18:06.467
OH, NO.
OH, I CAN'T IMAGINE--

18:06.500 --> 18:07.767
NO, REALLY, SHE HAS.

18:07.800 --> 18:10.300
OF COURSE,
SPEED AND PRECISION

18:10.333 --> 18:14.333
AREN'T THE MOST IMPORTANT
SURGICAL SKILLS, DR. YANG.

18:14.367 --> 18:15.667
BASICS ARE THE KEY.

18:15.700 --> 18:19.800
YOU NEED A SOLID FOUNDATION
BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE.

18:19.833 --> 18:22.467
***

18:22.500 --> 18:25.067
HMM.

18:25.067 --> 18:27.233
(Richard sighs)

18:27.267 --> 18:29.567
***

18:29.600 --> 18:33.367
OKAY, UM... WELL, I'LL SEE YOU
BACK AT THE LAB.
SIR.

18:33.400 --> 18:34.800
ENJOY YOUR LUNCH.
YOU, TOO. BYE.

18:34.833 --> 18:36.333
HAVE A NICE DAY, SIR.

18:36.367 --> 18:38.267
OKAY, I REALLY AM
KICKING THE CHIEF'S ASS.

18:38.300 --> 18:39.767
(laughs)

18:42.433 --> 18:43.467
GEORGE.

18:43.500 --> 18:45.167
NOT MY RESPONSIBILITY.

18:45.200 --> 18:46.433
WELL, WHO'S GONNA--
SEE YOU GUYS.

18:46.467 --> 18:49.800
IT'S OKAY.
I CAN ACCEPT REJECTION.

18:49.833 --> 18:51.567
I'VE GOT MY KNITTING.
MER--

18:51.600 --> 18:53.200
THE WEIRD THING IS...

18:53.233 --> 18:55.367
I THOUGHT I JUST SAW
MY FATHER.

18:55.400 --> 18:59.233
OH! THAT'S GOOD.
THAT'S SO GOOD.

18:59.267 --> 19:01.567
HMM. DID YOU MEET
YOUR SISTER, TOO?

19:01.600 --> 19:04.167
***

19:06.600 --> 19:08.300
APPOGGIATURA WON LAST YEAR.

19:08.333 --> 19:10.733
YEAR BEFORE THAT--

19:10.767 --> 19:12.667
AKSHAY BUDDIGA--
HE FAINTED,

19:12.700 --> 19:15.833
THEN GOT UP AND SPELLED
THE WORD ALOPECOID.

19:15.867 --> 19:17.767
KID'S A MAJOR LEGEND.

19:17.800 --> 19:20.700
(chuckles) ALL RIGHT.
NOW IT'S MY TURN.

19:20.733 --> 19:21.667
FIBROMYALGIA.

19:21.700 --> 19:22.767
FIBROMYALGIA?

19:22.800 --> 19:24.300
YEAH, WHAT'S WRONG
WITH FIBROMYALGIA?

19:24.333 --> 19:27.467
ANDREW WON THE REGIONALS.
HE'S GOING TO D.C.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.400
HE'S PROBABLY INSULTED
BY FIBROMYALGIA.

19:29.433 --> 19:31.567
FIBROMYALGIA...

19:31.600 --> 19:32.800
SUCTION.

19:32.833 --> 19:36.600
F-I-B-R-O-M-Y-A-L-G-I-A.

19:36.633 --> 19:37.567
FIBROMYALGIA.

19:37.600 --> 19:38.600
(laughs)

19:38.633 --> 19:41.233
SHE'S RIGHT.
THAT WAS KIND OF EASY.

19:41.267 --> 19:43.167
OKAY. YOU WANT ME
TO BRING ON THE HEAT?

19:43.200 --> 19:45.800
I'M GONNA BRING ON THE HEAT.

19:45.833 --> 19:48.600
OMPHALOCELE. (chuckles)

19:48.633 --> 19:50.200
OMPHALOCELE.
MM-HMM.

19:50.233 --> 19:51.700
MORE SUCTION IN THERE.

19:51.733 --> 19:54.567
(slurring speech) OMPHALOCELE.

19:54.600 --> 19:58.300
C-A...

19:58.333 --> 19:59.700
OKAY.
ANDREW...

19:59.733 --> 20:00.667
F...

20:00.700 --> 20:02.167
WHAT'S HAPPENING?
F...

20:02.200 --> 20:04.100
MARK THAT. WE'VE HIT
THE LANGUAGE CENTER.

20:04.133 --> 20:05.700
WE JUST HAVE TO PULL BACK.

20:09.100 --> 20:10.833
(slurring speech)
A... F...

20:10.867 --> 20:14.733
(Miranda) ANDREW.
F... S...

20:14.767 --> 20:16.533
ANDREW.

20:16.567 --> 20:19.367
(speaks gibberish)

20:19.400 --> 20:21.500
ANDREW, ANDREW,

20:21.533 --> 20:23.267
UH, SPELL IT AGAIN
FOR ME.

20:23.300 --> 20:25.333
E...

20:25.367 --> 20:27.200
GIVE ME THE STEALTH PROBE,
PLEASE.

20:27.233 --> 20:29.633
DR. SHEPHERD'S WORKING ON IT.
I DON'T WANT YOU TO BE SCARED.

20:29.667 --> 20:31.833
I-I WANT YOU TO WAIT.

20:31.867 --> 20:33.267
JUST WAIT.
I WANT YOU TO HOLD ON.

20:33.300 --> 20:35.133
MARK THAT AS WELL, PLEASE.

20:35.167 --> 20:37.033
OKAY, TRY NOW.

20:37.067 --> 20:38.600
OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

20:38.633 --> 20:43.100
ANDREW, SPELL OMPHALOCELE
ONE MORE TIME FOR ME.

20:45.133 --> 20:47.633
(normal voice)
OMPHALOCELE.

20:47.667 --> 20:49.333
MARK THAT, PLEASE.

20:49.367 --> 20:51.400
O-M-P...
(Derek) GOOD. OKAY.

20:51.433 --> 20:55.733
H-A-L-O-C-E-L-E.

20:55.767 --> 20:57.500
OMPHALOCELE.

20:57.533 --> 20:59.033
THAT'S IT! THAT'S PERFECT.

20:59.067 --> 21:01.400
(sniffles)

21:01.433 --> 21:04.067
DR. BAILEY, ARE YOU CRYING?

21:04.067 --> 21:07.567
OH, I GOT SOMETHING
IN MY EYE.

21:07.600 --> 21:10.367
YOU'RE DOING GREAT, ANDREW.
WE'RE ALMOST DONE.

21:10.400 --> 21:12.300
STOP LOOKIN' AT ME
LIKE THAT.

21:12.333 --> 21:14.333
IT'S MY HORMONES.
MM-HMM.

21:14.367 --> 21:15.300
I'M STILL A SURGEON.

21:15.333 --> 21:17.400
I'M JUST A SURGEON
WITH AN EXCESS OF ESTROGEN.

21:17.433 --> 21:20.300
DEAL WITH IT.
ANDREW, CAN YOU SPELL ESTROGEN?

21:20.333 --> 21:25.100
E-S-T-R-O-G-E-N.

21:25.133 --> 21:26.500
HERE'S A WORD FOR YOU.
DELUSIONAL.

21:26.533 --> 21:28.433
(Andrew) DELUSIONAL...

21:33.100 --> 21:36.400
(man) TODAY'S FINAL ASSIGNMENT
WILL SHOW HOW WELL

21:36.433 --> 21:38.267
YOU CAN TAKE THE SKILLS
YOU HAVE LEARNED

21:38.300 --> 21:40.667
AND APPLY THEM
TO A SINGLE OPERATION.

21:40.700 --> 21:42.200
(cracks knuckles)

21:42.233 --> 21:43.833
YOU MAY BEGIN.

21:43.867 --> 21:46.067
(Addison) SO I'M GONNA DO
THE SURGERY WITH A SMALL SCOPE,

21:46.100 --> 21:47.833
AND IT'LL BE MINIMALLY INVASIVE.

21:47.867 --> 21:50.700
AND THEN YOU SHOULD BE ABLE
TO DO THE REST OF YOUR RECOVERY

21:50.733 --> 21:52.667
FROM HOME.
THANK YOU.

21:52.700 --> 21:54.733
YEAH, OKAY.

21:56.533 --> 21:58.133
UH...

21:59.800 --> 22:02.133
UH, MOLLY, THIS IS DOCTOR...

22:02.167 --> 22:03.533
UH, THIS IS MEREDITH.

22:03.567 --> 22:06.133
SHE'S GONNA BE CONTINUING
YOUR PREP WORK

22:06.167 --> 22:07.667
AND TAKING YOUR VITALS.

22:07.700 --> 22:08.767
OKAY?

22:08.800 --> 22:09.800
OKAY.

22:09.833 --> 22:11.633
HI.

22:11.667 --> 22:13.400
HEY.

22:13.433 --> 22:15.333
UH, DO YOU MIND IF I, UM...

22:15.367 --> 22:16.500
NO, IT'S FINE.

22:16.533 --> 22:17.633
OKAY.

22:17.667 --> 22:19.667
I'M GETTING USED TO BEING
POKED AND PRODDED.

22:21.400 --> 22:23.300
THAT'S A... PRETTY RING.

22:23.333 --> 22:26.133
OH, THANKS.

22:26.167 --> 22:28.567
IT WAS MY GRANDMA'S
AND THEN MY MOM'S.

22:28.600 --> 22:31.167
YOU THINK I'M TOO YOUNG
TO BE MARRIED.

22:31.200 --> 22:32.700
NO, I--

22:32.733 --> 22:35.267
THAT'S OKAY.
EVERYBODY THINKS I'M TOO YOUNG.

22:35.300 --> 22:37.533
IF I SAW ME, I'D THINK
I WAS TOO YOUNG.

22:37.567 --> 22:39.500
UM... HOW--HOW OLD ARE YOU?

22:39.533 --> 22:40.700
22.

22:40.733 --> 22:42.400
ERIC'S 23,

22:42.433 --> 22:45.300
AND HE'S IN THE ARMY,
AND HE WAS GETTING SHIPPED OUT.

22:45.333 --> 22:48.100
AND... I JUST LOVE HIM
SO MUCH, YOU KNOW?

22:48.133 --> 22:50.333
ANYWAY, I PROPOSED.

22:50.367 --> 22:54.133
OH. AND YOUR, UH, PARENTS,
THEY APPROVE?

22:54.167 --> 22:55.500
OH, MY PARENTS ARE AMAZING.

22:55.533 --> 22:57.433
I MEAN,
YOU KNOW HOW DADS CAN BE.

22:57.467 --> 22:59.067
MINE'S PRETTY OVERPROTECTIVE,

22:59.067 --> 23:02.633
BUT... YOU KNOW, AT MY WEDDING,
WHEN HE GAVE ME AWAY,

23:02.667 --> 23:05.233
MY DAD CRIED, WHICH WAS...

23:05.267 --> 23:08.433
I HAD NEVER SEEN
MY DAD CRY BEFORE.

23:08.467 --> 23:11.133
BUT... I THINK IT WAS ALSO
KIND OF WEIRD FOR HIM

23:11.167 --> 23:13.300
'CAUSE I'M HIS LITTLE GIRL.

23:13.333 --> 23:14.833
YOU KNOW, I'M THE YOUNGEST,

23:14.867 --> 23:17.733
AND MY SISTER IS, LIKE,
NOWHERE NEAR READY FOR MARRIAGE.

23:17.767 --> 23:19.100
BUT IT WAS GOOD CRYING.

23:19.133 --> 23:22.767
LIKE HE WAS PROUD OF ME,
YOU KNOW?

23:22.800 --> 23:24.500
I'M SORRY.

23:24.533 --> 23:26.433
I'M JUST--I'M NERVOUS,
SO I'M TALKING.

23:26.467 --> 23:27.533
IS MY BLOOD PRESSURE--

23:27.567 --> 23:29.467
NO, THAT'S OKAY.
SO YOU HAVE A SISTER?

23:29.500 --> 23:31.400
YEAH, LEXIE.
SHE'S IN MEDICAL SCHOOL.

23:31.433 --> 23:33.133
HARVARD.
SHE'S THE SMART ONE.

23:33.167 --> 23:35.133
YOU SHOULD SEE
HOW MY DAD IS ABOUT HER.

23:35.167 --> 23:37.500
HE'S, LIKE, CRAZY PROUD.

23:40.833 --> 23:42.633
WELL, I'M GONNA GO.

23:42.667 --> 23:44.133
MEREDITH.
MM-HMM.

23:44.167 --> 23:47.433
DO YOU THINK MY BABY
IS GONNA BE OKAY?

23:47.467 --> 23:49.633
OH. WELL, I HOPE SO.

23:49.667 --> 23:51.467
ME, TOO.

23:51.500 --> 23:53.333
OKAY.

23:56.567 --> 23:58.300
***

23:58.333 --> 24:01.067
I NEED SOME BONES TO BREAK.
WHAT?

24:01.100 --> 24:02.200
SOME BONES TO BREAK,
SOMETHING TO SMASH.

24:02.233 --> 24:04.267
CAN YOU HELP ME
WITH THAT, PLEASE?

24:04.300 --> 24:07.067
UM, YOU CAN CLEAN UP
THIS CAST CRAP IF YOU WANT.

24:07.067 --> 24:10.433
***

24:11.700 --> 24:14.533
IS SHE FREAKING OUT?
NO. UNH-UNH. SHE'S FINE.

24:23.200 --> 24:25.200
(scoffs)

24:25.233 --> 24:27.233
YOU DON'T SEE HIM.

24:27.267 --> 24:28.733
EITHER OF YOU,
YOU DON'T SEE HIM.

24:28.767 --> 24:30.667
HE'S JUST--
HE'S JUST GEORGE TO YOU.

24:30.700 --> 24:33.367
HE'S... HE'S JUST O'MALLEY.
HE'S YOUR ROOMMATE.

24:33.400 --> 24:34.767
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GET ALL--

24:34.800 --> 24:36.600
HE MAKES MY WORLD STOP.

24:36.633 --> 24:38.600
GEORGE O'MALLEY IS SWEET

24:38.633 --> 24:40.367
AND KIND

24:40.400 --> 24:42.467
AND SMART AND STRONG.

24:42.500 --> 24:45.067
AND HE MAKES MY WORLD STOP
SO YOU SHUT UP ABOUT HIM.

24:45.067 --> 24:46.433

24:46.467 --> 24:49.167
DON'T FORGET TO CLEAN IT UP

(Meredith pants)

24:55.667 --> 24:57.067
HOLY CRAP.

24:57.067 --> 24:59.533
GEORGE IS HER McDREAMY.

24:59.567 --> 25:01.733
HUH. OH.

25:24.367 --> 25:26.400
ABSOLUTELY FLAWLESS.

25:26.433 --> 25:30.333
THEY CALL ME DR. WEBBER.

25:30.367 --> 25:35.367
(whispers) THAT'S WHY
I'M THE CHIEF.

25:35.400 --> 25:38.600
***

25:38.633 --> 25:41.067
THAT'S WHY I'M THE CHIEF.

25:41.100 --> 25:43.167

I'M THE CHIEF *

25:43.200 --> 25:44.467
* THE CHIEF

25:44.500 --> 25:46.667
SO WHEN IS MY MOM
GETTING OUT OF HERE?

25:46.700 --> 25:48.700
I'M SORRY, HONEY,

25:48.733 --> 25:50.633
BUT IT'S GONNA BE
A FEW DAYS.

25:50.667 --> 25:53.233
CAN YOU CALL AUNT SUE,
SEE IF SHE CAN PICK YOU UP?

25:53.267 --> 25:55.567
SO I GET TO SPEND MY BIRTHDAY
HANGING OUT WITH AUNT SUE.

25:55.600 --> 25:56.533
PERFECT.

25:56.567 --> 25:58.200
I PROMISE YOU, NEXT YEAR,

25:58.233 --> 26:00.100
NEXT YEAR, WE'LL DO SOMETHING
REALLY SPECIAL

26:00.133 --> 26:02.067
FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY.

26:02.100 --> 26:03.300
YOU NAME IT, IT'S DONE.

26:03.333 --> 26:05.100
I PROMISE.

26:05.133 --> 26:06.633
WHATEVER.

26:11.867 --> 26:13.533
SO THIS WHOLE LYING THING,

26:13.567 --> 26:15.467
THIS IS WORKING OUT
FOR YOU?

26:15.500 --> 26:17.500
EXCUSE ME?

26:17.533 --> 26:21.133
LOOK, YOU'RE GOING TO DIE,
AND SOON. YOU GET THAT, RIGHT?

26:21.167 --> 26:23.433
THERE'S NO ROSY PICTURE
TO PAINT HERE.

26:23.467 --> 26:25.133
YOU'RE NOT A MOTHER.

26:25.167 --> 26:27.067
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE

26:27.100 --> 26:28.833
TO HOLD YOUR NEWBORN BABY
IN YOUR ARMS

26:28.867 --> 26:30.767
AND SMELL THE TOP OF HER HEAD

26:30.800 --> 26:32.700
AND KNOW THAT YOUR ONLY JOB
IN THE WORLD

26:32.733 --> 26:34.533
IS TO PROTECT HER.

26:34.567 --> 26:36.633
YOU THINK
YOU'RE PROTECTING HER?
I AM PROTECTING HER.

26:36.667 --> 26:39.167
WELL, I GUESS YOU CAN
CALL IT WHAT YOU WANT.

26:39.200 --> 26:42.067
BUT YOU SHOULD JUST KNOW THAT
YOU'RE LEAVING BEHIND A KID

26:42.100 --> 26:44.533
THAT'LL PROBABLY HATE YOU
THE REST OF HER LIFE.

26:44.567 --> 26:46.567
AHEM.

26:47.700 --> 26:49.200
(lowered voice)
DR. KAREV--

26:49.233 --> 26:51.133
NO, I'M TALKING THIS TIME.
EXCUSE ME?

26:51.167 --> 26:53.567
I TELL THE TRUTH.
IT'S WHAT I DO.

26:53.600 --> 26:56.067
IT DOESN'T MAKE ME
A BAD DOCTOR.

26:56.100 --> 26:57.833
EVERYONE WALKS AROUND
THIS PLACE LYING.

26:57.867 --> 27:00.633
LOOK, WE TELL A PATIENT
THAT'S DYING THAT THERE'S HOPE

27:00.667 --> 27:02.600
WHEN THERE IS NO HOPE.

27:02.633 --> 27:04.533
MAYBE I'M A PIG,
MAYBE I'M AN ASS,

27:04.567 --> 27:06.467
MAYBE I'M A VERMIN
LIKE EVERYBODY SAYS.

27:06.500 --> 27:08.400
BUT I TELL THEM THE TRUTH.

27:08.433 --> 27:10.333
IT'S THE ONE THING
THAT I'VE GOT GOIN' FOR ME.

27:10.367 --> 27:12.267
AND YOU DON'T GET TO
TAKE THAT AWAY FROM ME

27:12.300 --> 27:15.267
AND CALL IT A LESSON, SIR.

27:24.667 --> 27:28.567
I-I SAW A PICTURE ONCE
FROM A LONG TIME AGO.

27:28.600 --> 27:32.367
YOU LOOK JUST LIKE HER--
YOUR MOTHER.

27:32.400 --> 27:34.300
YOU LOOK A LOT LIKE
MY GIRLS,

27:34.333 --> 27:36.067
ESPECIALLY MOLLY.

27:36.100 --> 27:38.133
YOU WERE TALKING TO HER?

27:38.167 --> 27:40.067
I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING
ABOUT ANYTHING.

27:40.100 --> 27:41.767
OH, SHE KNOWS ABOUT YOU.

27:41.800 --> 27:44.133
OR SHE KNOWS THAT HER FATHER
WAS MARRIED BEFORE

27:44.167 --> 27:46.367
AND HAD ANOTHER DAUGHTER.

27:46.400 --> 27:47.733
HAS ANOTHER DAUGHTER.

27:47.767 --> 27:49.567
NO, HAD IS RIGHT.

27:49.600 --> 27:53.100
YOUR FATHER THINKS ABOUT YOU.

27:53.133 --> 27:55.133
HE THINKS ABOUT YOU
A LOT.

27:55.167 --> 27:57.700
HE JUST...

27:57.733 --> 28:01.667
YOUR MOTHER...

28:01.700 --> 28:03.767
YOUR MOTHER...

28:03.800 --> 28:05.133
SHE BROKE HIM.

28:05.167 --> 28:06.667
AHEM. UH, EXCUSE ME.

28:06.700 --> 28:09.700
I-I HAVE TO WORK.

28:09.733 --> 28:13.067
***

28:21.500 --> 28:25.300
I SPENT YEARS STUDYING
THIS BOARD,

28:25.333 --> 28:29.167
HOLDING A CRYING BABY,

28:29.200 --> 28:30.700
TRYING TO GET AN IDEA

28:30.733 --> 28:34.367
WHEN MY WIFE
WOULD GET OUT OF SURGERY.

28:34.400 --> 28:36.767
"APPY" TAKES ABOUT AN HOUR.

28:36.800 --> 28:39.600
ANYTHING
WITH THE WORD "CARDIO,"

28:39.633 --> 28:43.367
AND I KNEW NOT TO PLAN ON
SEEING HER AT ALL THAT DAY.

28:43.400 --> 28:47.367
***

28:47.400 --> 28:51.100
THATCHER, ARE YOU AWARE
OF WHAT'S GOING ON WITH ELLIS?

28:51.133 --> 28:54.567
YOU HAVE NO RIGHT--
NO RIGHT--

28:54.600 --> 28:56.500
TO TALK TO ME ABOUT ELLIS.

28:56.533 --> 28:58.067
I'M SORRY.

28:58.067 --> 29:00.600
BUT I WAS TRYING TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT MEREDITH.

29:00.633 --> 29:03.200
***

29:03.233 --> 29:06.267
THATCHER, ELLIS HAS
EARLY-ONSET ALZHEIMER'S.

29:06.300 --> 29:09.200
IT'S ADVANCED.

29:09.233 --> 29:13.167
AND IT'S HARD ON MEREDITH,
AS YOU CAN IMAGINE.

29:13.200 --> 29:16.267
AND I THOUGHT YOU'D WANT
TO KNOW.

29:16.300 --> 29:19.300
***

29:27.133 --> 29:29.600
***

29:29.633 --> 29:31.600
HEY, ANDREW.

29:31.633 --> 29:34.633
IT'S DR. BAILEY.

29:34.667 --> 29:36.233
REMEMBER ME?

29:36.267 --> 29:38.233
I WAS IN SURGERY WITH YOU.

29:38.267 --> 29:40.567
I'M... I'M SORRY.

29:40.600 --> 29:43.800
NO, NO, DON'T WORRY.
DON'T WORRY.

29:43.833 --> 29:47.200
A LOT OF TIMES, KIDS WHO ARE
AWAKE DURING SURGERY

29:47.233 --> 29:48.600
DON'T REMEMBER AFTERWARDS.

29:48.633 --> 29:51.833
ANYWAY, YOUR OPERATION
WENT REALLY WELL.

29:51.867 --> 29:54.433
WE GOT ALL THAT TUMOR
OUTTA THERE,

29:54.467 --> 29:56.367
AND YOU'RE GONNA BE
JUST FINE.

29:56.400 --> 29:58.500
I... THANKS.

29:58.533 --> 30:00.267
OKAY.

30:00.300 --> 30:02.667
(sighs)

30:02.700 --> 30:04.600
YOU KNOW,
I HAVE A SON, TOO.

30:04.633 --> 30:09.300
AND I'M GOING HOME RIGHT NOW
TO TELL HIM THAT TODAY,

30:09.333 --> 30:12.233
I MET
THE BEST SPELLER IN SEATTLE.

30:12.267 --> 30:15.000
***

30:25.500 --> 30:29.067
***

30:29.100 --> 30:30.400
OH, HEY. DR. O'MALLEY.

30:30.433 --> 30:31.467
HI.

30:31.500 --> 30:34.300
I WAS LOOKING FOR YOU.
YOU WERE...

30:34.333 --> 30:36.267
BEFORE, WHEN I WAS
ASKING ABOUT MEREDITH...

30:36.300 --> 30:38.200
YOU KNOW HER.

30:38.233 --> 30:39.567
YOU'RE HER FRIEND.

30:39.600 --> 30:41.367
I USED TO BE HER ROOMMATE.

30:41.400 --> 30:42.600
OH, WOW.

30:42.633 --> 30:44.667
SO YOU KNOW HER
REALLY WELL.
PRETTY WELL.

30:44.700 --> 30:46.633
(chuckles) UM...

30:46.667 --> 30:49.567
SHE--SHE CAME TO SEE ME
A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO, AND--

30:49.600 --> 30:51.133
A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO?

30:51.167 --> 30:54.400
YEAH. I--AND I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY TO HER.

30:54.433 --> 30:57.233
SHE LOOKS SO--
SO MUCH LIKE HER MOTHER.

30:57.267 --> 31:00.100
ELLIS WAS COLD.

31:00.133 --> 31:02.733
I MEAN, I WAS A COWARD.
I WAS. I-I LEFT.

31:02.767 --> 31:07.300
BUT HER MOTHER WOULD NEVER
LET ME KNOW HER, AND...

31:07.333 --> 31:09.533
NOW I DON'T KNOW HOW
TO KNOW HER.

31:09.567 --> 31:12.233
UH...

31:12.267 --> 31:15.133
***

31:15.167 --> 31:18.467
WELL, MEREDITH
IS ANYTHING BUT COLD.

31:18.500 --> 31:21.233
SHE SMILES--
NOT THAT OFTEN--

31:21.267 --> 31:24.667
BUT WHEN SHE DOES--
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE SHE'S...

31:24.700 --> 31:26.600
REALLY GOING THROUGH A LOT--

31:26.633 --> 31:29.067
BUT... IT'S...

31:29.100 --> 31:30.667
IT'S LIKE YOU FEEL WARM.

31:30.700 --> 31:33.367
SHE'S KIND.

31:33.400 --> 31:36.133
I MEAN, SHE CAN BE
A LITTLE SELFISH.

31:36.167 --> 31:37.500
OH, SHE CAN BE...

31:37.533 --> 31:40.267
SHE'S FLAWED,
BUT SHE'S KIND.

31:40.300 --> 31:42.833
SHE CARES ABOUT PEOPLE.

31:42.867 --> 31:44.367
AND, UH...

31:44.400 --> 31:47.667
SHE CARES A-ABOUT HER PATIENTS.

31:47.700 --> 31:50.467
I THINK SHE'S GONNA BE
A BRILLIANT SURGEON.

31:50.500 --> 31:53.367
YOU KNOW, AROUND HERE,
SHE'S KNOWN AS THE ONE TO BEAT.

31:53.400 --> 31:55.733
SO, I-I DON'T KNOW,

31:55.767 --> 31:57.667
I GUESS SHE HAS THAT
IN COMMON WITH HER MOM,

31:57.700 --> 31:59.733
BUT...

31:59.767 --> 32:01.600
I THINK THE REST OF HER--
I THINK, UH,

32:01.633 --> 32:04.500
I THINK THE REST OF THAT,
SHE GETS FROM YOU.

32:04.533 --> 32:07.067
***

32:07.100 --> 32:11.300
HMM. DO--DO YOU KNOW...
WHERE SHE IS?

32:11.333 --> 32:12.667
I THINK SHE LEFT ALREADY.

32:12.700 --> 32:14.600
I COULD TELL HER YOU'RE--
YOU WERE HERE

32:14.633 --> 32:16.500
IF YOU WANT ME TO.

32:16.533 --> 32:19.600
YEAH. OKAY.

32:19.633 --> 32:20.800
THANK YOU.

32:20.833 --> 32:22.767
OKAY.

32:22.800 --> 32:23.733
OKAY.

32:23.767 --> 32:24.700
BYE.

32:24.733 --> 32:27.433
YEAH.

32:27.467 --> 32:30.400
***

32:30.433 --> 32:32.267
THANK YOU, GEORGE.

32:42.667 --> 32:43.533
HEY.

32:43.567 --> 32:45.267
HEY. STILL KNITTING?

32:45.300 --> 32:48.200
OH, YEAH.
I'M GETTING SO GOOD AT IT.

32:48.233 --> 32:49.367
HMM.

32:49.400 --> 32:52.067
I DID A CRANIOTOMY ON A KID
TODAY WHILE HE WAS AWAKE.

32:52.067 --> 32:53.800
I MET A SISTER
I NEVER KNEW I HAD.

32:53.833 --> 32:58.500
AND I SAW MY FATHER,
WHICH WAS, UH...

32:58.533 --> 33:00.433
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS.

33:00.467 --> 33:02.567
YOU OKAY?

33:02.600 --> 33:03.833
(chuckles)

33:03.867 --> 33:06.067
I HAVE MY KNITTING.

33:11.067 --> 33:13.367
STUDY HARD.
KEEP YOUR GRADES UP.

33:13.400 --> 33:15.100
(Beatrice)
STARTING NEXT YEAR,

33:15.133 --> 33:17.633
YOU'RE GONNA WANT TO TAKE
TWO A.P. CLASSES A SEMESTER

33:17.667 --> 33:19.667
IF YOU WANT TO GET INTO
A DECENT COLLEGE.

33:19.700 --> 33:21.733
MOM, THIS IS REALLY MORBID.

33:21.767 --> 33:23.667
AND YOUR AUNT SUE
IS KINDA LAZY

33:23.700 --> 33:25.433
WHEN IT COMES TO
PERSONAL HYGIENE.

33:25.467 --> 33:28.667
SO YOU MAY HAVE TO BE THE ONE
TO REMIND HER WHEN IT'S TIME

33:28.700 --> 33:31.367
TO GET YOUR EYEBROWS WAXED
OR GET YOUR HAIR CUT,

33:31.400 --> 33:34.067
BUT EVENTUALLY,
SHE'LL GET THE ROUTINE DOWN.

33:34.100 --> 33:36.233
CAN WE NOT HAVE
THIS CONVERSATION?

33:36.267 --> 33:37.433
OH, THIS MIGHT SOUND RANDOM,

33:37.467 --> 33:41.067
BUT WEAR UNDERWEAR
WITH PANTYHOSE.

33:41.100 --> 33:42.833
I KNOW IT MIGHT FEEL
A LITTLE BULKY,

33:42.867 --> 33:45.567
BUT HONESTLY,
IT'S A LITTLE SLUTTY NOT TO,

33:45.600 --> 33:47.500
AND ALSO, THAT'S HOW
YOU GET YEAST INFECTIONS.

33:47.533 --> 33:50.433
MOM... (laughs)
THIS IS TOTALLY GROSS.

33:50.467 --> 33:52.400
AND MARRY A KIND MAN,

33:52.433 --> 33:55.133
ONE WHO'S NICE TO HIS MOTHER.

33:55.167 --> 33:57.067
NOW IF HE LIVES
WITH HIS MOTHER,

33:57.100 --> 33:58.300
YOU RUN THE OPPOSITE WAY.

33:58.333 --> 34:02.100
MOM, I'M NOT GETTING MARRIED
ANYTIME SOON.

34:02.133 --> 34:03.800
YOU WILL SOMEDAY.

34:03.833 --> 34:06.067
AND WHEN THAT DAY COMES,

34:06.067 --> 34:08.767
JUST HAVE
ONE GLASS OF CHAMPAGNE

34:08.800 --> 34:11.667
AND THEN YOU DRINK WATER
FOR THE REST OF THE NIGHT

34:11.700 --> 34:14.567
BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING TACKIER
THAN A DRUNKEN BRIDE.

34:14.600 --> 34:17.600
MOM, I DON'T WANNA...

34:20.300 --> 34:23.367
WHY ARE YOU TELLING ME
ALL THIS?

34:26.867 --> 34:28.767
HONEY, I'VE BEEN SICK
FOR A LONG TIME,

34:28.800 --> 34:31.667
AND THE DOCTORS DON'T THINK
THAT I'M GONNA GET BETTER.

34:31.700 --> 34:34.333
NO.

34:36.100 --> 34:38.833
AMELIA, LISTEN TO ME.

34:38.867 --> 34:42.433
LOOK AT ME. AMELIA.

34:42.467 --> 34:44.100
THIS IS IMPORTANT.

34:44.133 --> 34:47.533
THIS ONE IS--IS REALLY
THE IMPORTANT ONE.

34:47.567 --> 34:50.233
SOMEDAY,
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A BABY.

34:50.267 --> 34:52.367
AND YOU'RE GONNA FEEL
OVERWHELMED

34:52.400 --> 34:54.767
BY THIS LITTLE LIFE
THAT YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR.

34:54.800 --> 34:56.700
AND YOU'RE GONNA THINK--

34:56.733 --> 34:58.633
WORRY THAT EVERYTHING YOU DO
IS WRONG,

34:58.667 --> 35:00.400
AND THAT'S NORMAL.

35:00.433 --> 35:02.333
YOU'RE GONNA OBSESS
ABOUT WHAT TO FEED IT

35:02.367 --> 35:04.500
AND WHERE TO SEND IT
TO SCHOOL

35:04.533 --> 35:08.300
AND WHETHER IT SHOULD TAKE
VIOLIN OR PIANO.

35:08.333 --> 35:11.067
BUT I'M GONNA LET YOU IN
ON A LITTLE SECRET.

35:11.067 --> 35:13.800
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

35:13.833 --> 35:15.733
WHETHER YOUR KID IS
A CONCERT PIANIST

35:15.767 --> 35:17.267
OR A MATH GENIUS,

35:17.300 --> 35:19.167
IT JUST DOESN'T MATTER.

35:19.200 --> 35:21.100
BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY,

35:21.133 --> 35:23.633
ALL THAT MATTERS
IS IF YOUR KID IS HAPPY.

35:23.667 --> 35:27.367
SO YOU'RE GONNA FEEL SAD
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

35:27.400 --> 35:30.367
AND THAT'S OKAY.
THAT'S--THAT'S FINE.

35:30.400 --> 35:34.133
BUT DON'T FEEL SAD FOREVER,
OKAY?

35:34.167 --> 35:35.200
YOU CAN PROMISE ME THAT?

35:35.233 --> 35:38.233
YOU PROMISE ME THAT YOU WON'T
FEEL SAD FOR TOO LONG.

35:38.267 --> 35:40.067
I PROMISE.
OKAY.

35:40.100 --> 35:41.400
THANK YOU.

35:41.433 --> 35:43.333
'CAUSE YOU'RE MAKING ME FEEL
MUCH BETTER.

35:43.367 --> 35:45.667
(sniffles)

35:45.700 --> 35:47.600
(inhales)

35:47.633 --> 35:51.700
LIFE IS NOT
A SPECTATOR SPORT.

35:53.233 --> 35:56.300
WIN, LOSE OR DRAW...

35:56.333 --> 35:59.567
THE GAME IS PROGRESS...

35:59.600 --> 36:03.067
WHETHER WE WANT IT TO BE
OR NOT.

36:03.100 --> 36:04.200
TA-DA.

36:04.233 --> 36:06.733
YOU MADE ME A SWEATER...

36:06.767 --> 36:07.567
TODAY?

36:07.600 --> 36:09.633
IN ONE DAY,
YOU MADE ME A SWEATER?

36:09.667 --> 36:12.533
YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW,
I JUST, I HAD SOME TIME, SO...

36:12.567 --> 36:15.500
WOW. THAT VOW OF CELIBACY
MUST REALLY BE SOMETHING.

36:15.533 --> 36:18.400
YOU KNOW WHAT? JUST ACCEPT
YOUR GIFT AND SAY THANK YOU.

36:18.433 --> 36:21.300
DOES THIS MEAN I DON'T GET
ANY SEXUAL FAVORS?

36:21.333 --> 36:23.167
SWEATER INSTEAD OF SEX?

36:23.200 --> 36:25.067
SMELL IT.

36:25.100 --> 36:27.533
GO ON. SMELL IT.

36:30.833 --> 36:33.667
IT SMELLS LIKE IZZIE.

36:33.700 --> 36:35.800
YEAH, I WORE IT
FOR THREE HOURS.

36:35.833 --> 36:38.100
SO THAT IS THE CLOSEST
