03:26.707 --> 03:29.333
Mrs. Claus is hot!

03:29.501 --> 03:31.252
Yeah!

03:33.130 --> 03:34.672
My name is Samantha Caine.

03:35.132 --> 03:36.716
At least, I think it is.

03:36.884 --> 03:40.553
You might not believe it to look at me,
but I was born only years eight ago...

03:40.721 --> 03:42.430
on a beach in New Jersey.

03:42.598 --> 03:46.100
I entered the world fully grown,
wearing clothes I don't remember buying.

03:46.268 --> 03:48.352
In the back pocket a single key...

03:48.520 --> 03:51.188
filed blank and faceless.

03:51.356 --> 03:54.942
A fitting metaphor,
but otherwise no help whatsoever. None.

03:55.110 --> 03:57.028
Sometimes I stand naked in the mirror...

03:57.195 --> 03:58.779
try to guess my age.

03:59.615 --> 04:01.365
Thirty-five, maybe?

04:01.533 --> 04:03.993
I have lots of scars.

04:04.161 --> 04:08.039
They call my condition
focal retrograde amnesia.

04:08.206 --> 04:11.459
It's no picnic,
but I've learned to live with it.

04:11.627 --> 04:14.045
Got a job I love, been seeing someone.

04:14.212 --> 04:16.505
Nice guy. Good sense of humor.

04:16.673 --> 04:20.343
- Hound of the Baskervilles.
- Mad dogs. Mad dogs.

04:20.510 --> 04:22.762
- Hal, I gotta tell you.
- Yes? Yes?

04:22.930 --> 04:25.181
Of all the Christmas pageants
I have ever seen...

04:25.349 --> 04:27.600
this was by far the most recent.
Ha, ha.

04:27.768 --> 04:29.143
For God's sakes, Sam...

04:29.311 --> 04:32.188
I've got teenage girls that are
playing the Three Wise Men.

04:32.356 --> 04:33.522
What'd you expect?

04:33.690 --> 04:34.774
Teenage boys?

04:34.942 --> 04:36.609
I thought they did fine.

04:36.777 --> 04:40.446
It was the first nativity where Joseph
stares at the Wise Men's tits all night.

04:40.614 --> 04:42.740
Yeah? Ha, ha.

04:43.408 --> 04:46.661
Her name is Caitlin,
and when I woke up on that long-ago day...

04:46.828 --> 04:48.746
I was two months pregnant
with her.

04:48.914 --> 04:51.290
I don't know who her father is.
I may never.

04:51.458 --> 04:52.541
I just know she's mine.

04:54.169 --> 04:55.544
His name is Mr. Perkins.

04:55.712 --> 04:57.171
My mom named him for me.

04:57.339 --> 05:00.508
- Caitlin! Come help in the kitchen!
- That's her.

05:00.676 --> 05:02.385
- That's who?
- Her mom.

05:02.552 --> 05:04.178
She's got amnesia.

05:04.346 --> 05:06.222
- Swear?
- Swear.

05:07.432 --> 05:09.225
Too weird.

05:10.435 --> 05:11.727
Hello, girls.

05:11.895 --> 05:13.854
Caitlin, come help me in the kitchen.

05:14.022 --> 05:16.440
Hurry up, because I forget where it is.

05:18.527 --> 05:19.944
- Bah!
- Ha, ha.

05:27.828 --> 05:29.495
Some more sugar.

05:38.630 --> 05:40.506
Raymond! If I catch you smoking again...

05:40.674 --> 05:42.633
they'll never find the body.
Understand?

05:42.801 --> 05:44.969
- Yes, Miss Caine.
- Have a cookie.

05:48.640 --> 05:52.309
- Quiet, everybody.
- As the year draws to a close, I would like...

05:52.477 --> 05:55.271
I would like to share with you
a few things about myself...

05:55.439 --> 05:57.481
things of which I am especially proud.

05:58.483 --> 06:02.737
First, I'm proud to say
that I don't smoke...

06:02.904 --> 06:06.115
I don't drink, and I don't swear.

06:06.283 --> 06:08.576
- Oh, shit, I do smoke and drink.
- Hal.

06:10.829 --> 06:12.663
- You see, right there.
- Block your ears.

06:12.831 --> 06:14.665
To our dear friends...

06:14.833 --> 06:19.128
may the best of your past
be the worst of your future.

06:19.296 --> 06:21.172
I'll drink to that.

06:21.339 --> 06:23.466
Take a bow, my dear. Take a bow.

06:23.633 --> 06:25.760
We got the mistletoe.

06:32.309 --> 06:35.019
Oh, sweetie.

06:35.687 --> 06:37.980
Eight years.

06:38.148 --> 06:40.691
Except for my name, all traces are lost.

06:40.859 --> 06:42.651
I used to hire expensive detectives.

06:42.819 --> 06:44.320
Now I'm down to the cheap ones.

06:44.488 --> 06:45.821
Doesn't seem to matter.

06:45.989 --> 06:49.325
The woman I was,
the one I used to be, she's gone.

06:49.493 --> 06:50.910
I've kissed her good night.

06:52.245 --> 06:55.164
- Ha, ha.
- Police. Don't move.

06:55.332 --> 06:57.333
What the hell is this?

06:57.501 --> 06:59.835
Don't give me attitude, sir.

07:00.045 --> 07:02.588
See, you're assuming
I won't shoot your sorry ass...

07:02.756 --> 07:05.174
and everyone knows,
when you make an assumption...

07:05.342 --> 07:07.426
you make an ass
out of "u" and "mption."

07:08.970 --> 07:11.847
I'm Sergeant Madigan, Vice,
and if you cop a 'tude, jerkoff...

07:12.057 --> 07:15.726
I will see to it you spend the next
10 years in prison getting ass-fucked.

07:15.894 --> 07:18.771
If the case is thrown out
because my arrest was too violent...

07:18.939 --> 07:22.358
I will personally hire men
to ass-fuck you for the next 10 years.

07:22.526 --> 07:25.402
So if you're an ass-fucking fan,
you go ahead and mouth off.

07:25.570 --> 07:29.573
Meanwhile, you're under arrest
for the crime of prostitution.

07:30.325 --> 07:32.576
Officer Donlevy, read him his rights.

07:32.744 --> 07:34.870
- What?
- His rights.

07:36.706 --> 07:38.040
You have the remight...

07:38.208 --> 07:39.959
You have the right to remain silent.

07:40.127 --> 07:43.963
And anything you say and do
will be held against you in a...

07:44.131 --> 07:47.508
You gotta listen to me, man.
I got a wife. This... I've never...

07:47.676 --> 07:49.426
This is the first time I've done this.

07:49.594 --> 07:50.636
Sir, sir.

07:50.804 --> 07:54.431
Listen to me. I can see from your choice
you're not a wealthy man.

07:55.642 --> 07:58.602
Now, in light of the damage
that this arrest could do to you...

07:58.770 --> 08:01.021
we might be able to make
some arrangement.

08:04.151 --> 08:05.234
God!

08:06.027 --> 08:08.320
Gotta stop using bums.

08:08.488 --> 08:09.655
Forget that.

08:09.823 --> 08:11.240
They looked like cops.

08:11.408 --> 08:13.200
We pulled it off, didn't we?

08:13.368 --> 08:14.660
It was embarrassing.

08:14.828 --> 08:16.579
Want me to hire actors, for chrissake?

08:17.080 --> 08:19.665
These guys are cheap.
They work for food.

08:19.833 --> 08:21.750
When they puke on you, is that a refund?

08:24.171 --> 08:25.296
Oh, Trin...

08:25.463 --> 08:28.424
I'm pissing myself here,
you're so funny.

08:30.594 --> 08:34.304
- What's this?
- I got movement on Samantha Caine.

08:35.097 --> 08:38.100
- You're kidding.
- Nope. I may have a lead on someone...

08:38.268 --> 08:41.437
who rented Amnesia Chick
an apartment back in '87.

08:41.605 --> 08:43.772
They still have some of her stuff.

08:43.940 --> 08:46.233
Get out of here.
Where'd that come from?

08:46.610 --> 08:49.904
Lucky break. Old lady died
and one of her asshole grandkids...

08:50.071 --> 08:51.989
found a credit card in a shoe box...

08:52.157 --> 08:53.949
name Samantha Caine on it.

08:54.117 --> 08:56.327
Tried to use it at Nordstrom's.

08:58.747 --> 09:00.164
Okay, here's what we do.

09:00.582 --> 09:04.627
You get on the phone to Amnesia Chick.
Tell her we need more cash.

09:14.179 --> 09:16.513
Hey, that was a really swell party.

09:16.681 --> 09:19.433
Thanks again for the ride.

09:19.809 --> 09:21.977
You and Hal, you've been
together now, what?

09:22.145 --> 09:24.647
What? A couple of years?

09:25.106 --> 09:27.149
How often do you two...?

09:27.567 --> 09:30.152
Stick our fingers in our hands
and pull them out again?

09:30.320 --> 09:31.654
Every chance we get.

09:31.821 --> 09:32.905
Earl, do me a favor.

09:33.073 --> 09:35.574
Have bubbles come out of your mouth
and say, "Hic."

09:35.992 --> 09:38.994
Goddamn it, I am not drunk.

09:39.204 --> 09:41.121
Here, I'll prove it to you.

09:42.207 --> 09:45.000
Hey. Hey, come on.

09:45.835 --> 09:46.877
Hey! Stop that!

09:47.045 --> 09:48.254
- I'm sorry.
- No!

11:45.538 --> 11:48.832
And so much for
the skydiving Santa of Hutchinson County.

11:49.000 --> 11:52.211
Meanwhile, WICC News journeyed
to Honesdale today...

11:52.379 --> 11:55.005
where Santa's Mrs. Kringle
turned out to celebrate...

11:55.173 --> 11:56.924
her hubby's worldwide tour.

11:57.092 --> 11:58.759
And after one look at her...

11:58.968 --> 12:03.013
I'm thinking Santa got
what he really wanted this Christmas.

12:03.181 --> 12:06.809
The parade included floats
and participants from four counties.

12:06.976 --> 12:10.979
Everyone enjoyed themselves, especially
the young and the young at heart.

12:11.147 --> 12:12.147
Up next...

12:12.315 --> 12:14.483
Gotta be fucking kidding!

12:14.651 --> 12:15.651
No.

12:17.695 --> 12:19.947
No fucking way!

12:20.365 --> 12:22.199
It's impossible!

12:35.088 --> 12:37.381
So you rest up.

12:38.800 --> 12:41.468
And I'll see you in the morning.

12:41.636 --> 12:42.845
Sweet dreams.

13:11.207 --> 13:13.584
I want a cigarette.

13:14.669 --> 13:15.711
I don't smoke.

13:17.714 --> 13:19.923
You used to.

13:23.678 --> 13:25.596
See how easy it comes back?

13:25.763 --> 13:27.514
I'm coming back.

13:28.349 --> 13:30.726
You know that, don't you?

13:30.894 --> 13:33.061
Name's Charly, by the way.

13:33.229 --> 13:35.898
You're gonna love me.

13:44.657 --> 13:47.576
Now, this is the intergalactic
slammer. It's a jail, all right?

13:47.744 --> 13:50.913
This guy here, this is the Borium Dude.
He's kind of like a dinosaur.

13:51.080 --> 13:52.623
And this is his escape chute.

13:52.790 --> 13:56.043
He's mean, quick, and he don't
take no shit, either, all right?

13:56.211 --> 13:58.962
He can shoot at the guards
with his arrow right here.

14:00.465 --> 14:04.635
- It's cool?
- Todd, time for dinner.

14:04.844 --> 14:06.220
Now.

14:12.393 --> 14:14.102
Guess you'd better go in.

14:14.270 --> 14:16.438
Hey, hope you like the toy.

14:16.606 --> 14:18.774
It's awesome.

14:19.943 --> 14:23.111
Dad, Mom, she gets weird.

14:23.279 --> 14:27.699
Like on my birthday
when you gave me that Schwinn...

14:28.826 --> 14:32.538
she called the bicycle store
to see if there's been any robberies.

14:34.749 --> 14:38.585
Look, tell her I don't
steal them locally, all right? Ha, ha.

14:38.753 --> 14:40.295
Man.

14:43.466 --> 14:45.509
Sorry, but I can't take this.

14:45.718 --> 14:47.761
You know how Mom will get.

14:51.307 --> 14:54.059
- Guess I'll see you.
- Yeah. All right.

14:59.816 --> 15:01.650
How do you like that?

15:08.157 --> 15:09.741
Yo, Trin. Me. What's up?

15:09.909 --> 15:11.868
- Ready to be happy?
- Yeah.

15:12.036 --> 15:13.870
Remember the landlady I told you about?

15:14.038 --> 15:16.248
The Caine woman
was her favorite tenant.

15:16.416 --> 15:18.709
Then one day,
the tenant never comes home.

15:18.876 --> 15:20.127
Old lady very sad.

15:20.295 --> 15:22.546
So sad, she can't throw away
Amnesia Chick's shit.

15:22.755 --> 15:24.172
It's pay dirt, Mitch.

15:24.340 --> 15:26.049
Got an old postcard, never mailed.

15:26.217 --> 15:28.385
Woman telling everyone
she just got engaged.

15:28.553 --> 15:30.637
Samantha's handwriting. Perfect match.

15:30.805 --> 15:34.182
She was engaged to some guy in Jersey.
No phone number, just an address.

15:34.350 --> 15:36.226
Holy shit. Score.

15:36.394 --> 15:38.437
Sweetheart, that's worth time and a half.

15:38.605 --> 15:41.481
Double. I made us look good.
Her other PIs couldn't find dick.

15:41.649 --> 15:44.192
Of course not.
Took a true dick-hound like yourself.

15:44.360 --> 15:46.862
Tell Miss Caine I'm coming
to see her tonight.

15:58.958 --> 16:02.085
Honey, you have an ETA
on that carrot?

16:02.629 --> 16:04.254
Stow it.

16:05.965 --> 16:08.300
Maybe you should just take it with you
to school tomorrow.

16:08.468 --> 16:12.012
- Ha, ha. You're killing me. You're so funny.
- Ha, ha.

16:12.889 --> 16:14.556
Here. Here. Give me the knife.

16:16.059 --> 16:17.392
I'm gonna cut this carrot...

16:17.560 --> 16:20.687
and you'll eat the blood-soaked pieces
and like it. Piss off.

16:37.372 --> 16:39.414
Hon?

16:40.208 --> 16:41.958
Look at something, will you?

16:49.884 --> 16:51.593
How the hell do you...?

16:52.970 --> 16:54.721
I used to do this.

16:54.889 --> 16:57.349
I'm a chef. Yahoo!

16:57.517 --> 16:58.767
Look what she's doing here.

17:00.645 --> 17:01.937
Give me something else.

17:02.105 --> 17:03.897
Quick. Anything.

17:04.065 --> 17:05.398
- Here.
- Go. I'm hot to trot.

17:05.566 --> 17:06.817
- Tomato, tomato.
- Tomato!

17:09.112 --> 17:10.112
Look at this.

17:10.279 --> 17:12.781
Look at this woman go. Okay, okay, fine.

17:12.949 --> 17:14.407
More.

17:14.575 --> 17:17.493
Pepper! Pepper! Celery!

17:19.288 --> 17:20.372
Look at this!

17:20.540 --> 17:21.873
- More! More!
- Scallions!

17:22.040 --> 17:23.625
Scallions. Give her scallions.

17:26.838 --> 17:28.672
One more tomato.

17:28.840 --> 17:31.758
Look at this. Look at this woman.
She's amazing!

17:41.060 --> 17:43.228
Chefs do that.

17:50.361 --> 17:53.572
Timothy, I know you're gonna
kill me. I know you're gonna kill me.

17:53.740 --> 17:55.490
Please use the gun, not the knife.

17:55.658 --> 17:58.660
As a favor to me. I'm begging you.

18:00.329 --> 18:05.167
Goddamn it, how can I tell the feds
about the fucking Honeymoon thing?

18:05.793 --> 18:07.627
I don't know a fucking thing about it.

18:16.387 --> 18:18.180
No, you don't.

18:18.347 --> 18:20.098
I don't know a fucking thing.

18:20.725 --> 18:23.560
You know, I can tell
when someone's lying to me.

18:27.565 --> 18:29.107
What's so fucking important?

18:29.275 --> 18:31.234
Remember your old colleague...

18:31.402 --> 18:32.611
One-Eyed Jack?

18:32.779 --> 18:34.529
Yeah. He's doing seven to 10 upstate.

18:34.697 --> 18:36.907
Not anymore. He broke out.

18:37.074 --> 18:39.826
Two days after seeing something
on TV that "disturbed" him.

18:39.994 --> 18:41.870
Yeah, me too.
It's called Baywatch Nights.

18:42.038 --> 18:43.538
Wanna get to the fucking point?

18:43.706 --> 18:46.583
While under sedation,
he said Charly Baltimore's alive, sir.

18:47.251 --> 18:49.002
Daedalus is understandably concerned.

18:49.170 --> 18:52.130
He was under the impression
you disposed of her eight years ago.

18:52.298 --> 18:54.382
I know it's unlikely,
but if she were alive...

18:54.550 --> 18:57.761
I think she might be in contact
with the old man in Massachusetts.

18:58.137 --> 18:59.971
Tap his phone.

19:01.224 --> 19:04.351
Tell Daedalus I'm on my way.
Timothy out.

19:20.910 --> 19:22.994
I can't see Mr. Perkins.

19:23.788 --> 19:26.331
He's there. He's on the sled. See him?

19:26.499 --> 19:27.999
He's watching you.

19:28.918 --> 19:30.627
He's very excited.

19:30.837 --> 19:32.462
Oh, that's better.

19:33.297 --> 19:34.381
Ready to try it alone?

19:34.549 --> 19:37.050
I want you to hold my hand.

19:37.635 --> 19:39.845
Oh. Just pretend I am.

19:40.012 --> 19:41.054
You can do it.

19:41.222 --> 19:43.056
Piece of cake. Here we go.

19:43.224 --> 19:44.266
Ready?

19:44.433 --> 19:47.102
- Mom, it won't work, I swear.
- Sure, it will!

19:47.270 --> 19:49.062
You're one of the X-Men. You're tough.

19:49.230 --> 19:50.772
Ready? Let's go.

19:50.940 --> 19:53.108
Three, two, one, go.

19:53.276 --> 19:54.317
Wait! I'm not ready!

19:54.610 --> 19:57.571
Go! Go!
Keep going! Keep going! Keep going!

20:05.538 --> 20:08.707
I can't do it. I wanna go home.

20:08.875 --> 20:10.542
Look, I know you're afraid.

20:10.710 --> 20:13.712
That's the whole point.
Can't you see that?

20:17.383 --> 20:19.926
Stop being a little baby and get up.

20:21.137 --> 20:23.847
I can't skate anymore. My wrist hurts.

20:30.646 --> 20:32.856
Life is pain.

20:33.024 --> 20:34.399
Get used to it.

20:35.526 --> 20:39.154
See, you will skate all the way
to the shore, princess...

20:39.322 --> 20:42.657
and you will not fall again.

20:43.659 --> 20:44.826
Am I understood?

21:11.520 --> 21:14.356
I'm just guessing,
but this is a tree house.

21:14.565 --> 21:16.900
I think you wanted a doghouse.

21:20.321 --> 21:21.738
Little joke.

21:23.699 --> 21:26.368
She said that her wrist hurt.

21:27.578 --> 21:29.955
I didn't know it was fractured.

21:39.715 --> 21:42.550
I don't remember...

21:42.969 --> 21:45.011
what I said to her.

21:45.930 --> 21:48.056
I can't remember.

21:54.897 --> 21:56.231
No!

21:56.399 --> 21:58.441
For God's sake, I'm not gonna hurt you.

21:58.609 --> 22:00.986
It's not me I'm worried about.

22:34.270 --> 22:35.478
Evening, Charly.

22:36.147 --> 22:37.897
Long time.

22:41.652 --> 22:43.069
- Mommy!
- Get out!

22:43.904 --> 22:47.115
Mommy! Help!

22:59.420 --> 23:00.628
Mommy!

23:43.923 --> 23:46.216
I want my eye back, bitch!

23:46.383 --> 23:47.425
No!

24:21.210 --> 24:22.585
Chefs do that.

24:29.218 --> 24:30.468
Caitlin.

24:30.636 --> 24:33.680
Oh, my God!
We have to find Caitlin! Caitlin!

24:33.848 --> 24:35.181
Caitlin! No!

24:35.349 --> 24:38.560
Slow down, slow down!
Your kid's okay. She's in my car.

24:40.104 --> 24:42.480
Jesus! What the hell's going on here?

24:43.232 --> 24:44.315
Freeze!

24:44.483 --> 24:45.733
Don't hurt him!

24:46.068 --> 24:47.110
Don't shoot!

24:47.278 --> 24:49.737
Yeah, don't shoot, like she said!

24:49.905 --> 24:51.739
Call an ambulance!

24:55.077 --> 24:58.997
This man, he's going to help me
find out some things...

24:59.582 --> 25:02.167
so we'll be safe. You understand?

25:02.793 --> 25:04.627
When will you be back home?

25:06.714 --> 25:09.215
Before you know it, I swear.

25:10.551 --> 25:13.428
Here. I want you
to keep a candle burning...

25:13.596 --> 25:17.098
in a window for me.

25:17.558 --> 25:20.560
That's called keeping a vigil.

25:20.728 --> 25:22.395
Okay?

25:22.938 --> 25:25.231
That's to light my way home.

25:27.526 --> 25:28.985
Here.

25:30.112 --> 25:32.614
This is to my portable phone.

25:32.781 --> 25:34.449
I keep it with me.

25:35.034 --> 25:36.701
You call me any time.

25:36.869 --> 25:38.620
Okay?

25:45.586 --> 25:46.794
Why don't you keep this?

25:49.715 --> 25:51.758
For luck.

25:51.926 --> 25:54.719
Let's have Mr. Perkins wear it.

25:54.887 --> 25:58.598
There. See?

26:12.571 --> 26:14.656
You do what you have to.

26:16.492 --> 26:18.660
But, Sam...

26:18.827 --> 26:21.079
the person you used to be...

26:21.288 --> 26:24.123
Whatever you find, I'm not scared.

26:25.459 --> 26:27.543
I never will be, not ever.

26:28.629 --> 26:30.630
Thank you.

26:46.272 --> 26:47.313
Bye.

26:53.654 --> 26:58.199
Mr. Perkins,
you lost one of your agents...

26:59.326 --> 27:01.953
whose training included,
among other things...

27:02.121 --> 27:03.997
counter-assassination.

27:05.374 --> 27:08.543
And now she turns up as belle
of the Christmas parade.

27:08.711 --> 27:11.796
Well, that information is
two weeks old, Mr. President.

27:12.548 --> 27:15.341
To my knowledge,
Charlene Baltimore died...

27:15.509 --> 27:18.094
in my employ, relic of the Cold War.

27:18.262 --> 27:23.224
The kind of violent operative that has
since been eliminated from our ranks.

27:23.392 --> 27:24.851
You recruited this woman?

27:26.312 --> 27:28.229
For Chapter, sir.

27:28.689 --> 27:31.316
In the late '70s
her father was a friend of mine.

27:31.734 --> 27:33.901
Stop that.
I don't wanna hear that stuff.

27:34.069 --> 27:36.237
Intelligence community.

27:36.405 --> 27:37.822
You people are unbelievable.

27:37.990 --> 27:39.991
You dump a mess like this in my lap...

27:40.159 --> 27:43.578
and then you come whining to me
and say, "Where is our funding?"

27:43.746 --> 27:45.455
Well, I'll tell you where it is.

27:45.622 --> 27:48.541
Can you say "healthcare"?

28:04.224 --> 28:07.060
I'm not talking about the linen

28:07.227 --> 28:09.270
And I don't wanna change your life

28:09.438 --> 28:10.438
Moving in.

28:10.606 --> 28:12.065
What?

28:12.232 --> 28:13.941
It's...

28:14.526 --> 28:18.071
It's... The song's not about linen.
It's not linen.

28:18.238 --> 28:21.074
Yeah, whatever. So you cold?

28:21.241 --> 28:22.325
Yeah. Freezing.

28:22.493 --> 28:24.118
I'll turn on the heat.

28:24.286 --> 28:26.496
Doesn't work,
but it makes an annoying noise...

28:26.663 --> 28:28.623
- ...distracts from the cold.
- I'll pass.

28:28.791 --> 28:30.041
Thanks.

28:33.879 --> 28:35.880
Who knew I had an old fiancé?

28:38.467 --> 28:41.552
And now we're just gonna
pay a surprise visit?

28:41.720 --> 28:45.473
Well, there are no bells
or whistles going off...

28:45.641 --> 28:47.475
because I don't remember any of this.

28:47.643 --> 28:51.020
Jeez, that's too bad, because that's
the cream of the crop, believe me.

28:52.189 --> 28:53.648
I forgot to ask.

28:53.816 --> 28:55.691
Why is it that you got so far?

28:55.859 --> 28:56.943
Say what?

28:57.111 --> 29:00.238
Well, I mean...

29:00.406 --> 29:02.824
you seem kind of low-rent.

29:02.991 --> 29:04.033
No offense.

29:04.535 --> 29:05.576
None taken.

29:05.744 --> 29:07.203
Really, I was about to... Hey!

29:07.371 --> 29:08.663
Hey, now!

29:11.500 --> 29:12.542
Yeah.

29:13.252 --> 29:14.836
Shit.

29:17.172 --> 29:18.840
Are you okay?

29:19.007 --> 29:21.259
Is your neck all right?
You don't have whiplash?

29:21.427 --> 29:23.094
What?

29:23.262 --> 29:24.762
I'm just...

29:24.930 --> 29:27.223
Since you almost
just ran us off the road...

29:27.391 --> 29:29.684
I'm wondering, what it is
that you take away...

29:29.852 --> 29:31.686
from an experience like that.

29:31.854 --> 29:35.022
Don't get me wrong. I mean,
I'm sure it's very enriching in some way.

29:35.190 --> 29:37.483
And I know that she was
probably very moved...

29:37.693 --> 29:40.695
by having some asshole
hang out the window and go, "Woo-hoo!"

29:40.863 --> 29:43.489
Hey, I didn't hang out the window
and go, "Woo, woo, woo."

29:43.657 --> 29:44.991
I checked out her form, okay?

29:46.160 --> 29:49.871
If it's any consolation,
you got her beat hands down.

29:50.038 --> 29:51.205
- Really?
- Yeah.

29:51.373 --> 29:53.666
From the neck up.

29:54.334 --> 29:55.376
This is exciting.

29:55.544 --> 29:58.004
You saw her tits. It's so neat.

29:58.172 --> 30:00.506
Look, it's a guy thing, all right?

30:00.674 --> 30:02.758
Hey, now, you got a nice body and all...

30:02.926 --> 30:05.678
but those, you could see them
coming around the corner.

30:05.846 --> 30:08.014
You got time to comb your hair. Shit.

30:10.476 --> 30:11.601
Hey, hey, hey.

30:11.768 --> 30:13.269
What's that?

30:14.396 --> 30:15.897
Charly was my name in the dream.

30:17.065 --> 30:19.150
"To Charly. Love, Nathan."

30:19.943 --> 30:21.986
Nathan J. Waldman, Ph.D.

30:22.154 --> 30:24.947
- All right. Let's find a phone.
- Found one.

30:25.115 --> 30:26.157
Find his number.

30:28.035 --> 30:29.368
Take the stand.

30:29.536 --> 30:32.705
I got it. Now what'll I do with it?

30:35.667 --> 30:37.168
Sit down!

30:49.348 --> 30:50.640
Alice, please.

30:50.807 --> 30:52.266
Your dog, Alice.

30:52.434 --> 30:55.102
It and my appetite
are mutually exclusive.

30:55.270 --> 30:58.105
- Well, what's wrong with the dog?
- It's simple.

30:58.273 --> 31:01.400
He's been licking his asshole
for the last three straight hours.

31:01.568 --> 31:04.654
I submit there is nothing there
worth more than an hour's attention...

31:04.821 --> 31:07.990
and I should think that whatever
he is attempting to dislodge...

31:08.158 --> 31:11.244
is either gone for
good or there to stay.

31:12.871 --> 31:14.789
Wouldn't you agree?

31:22.381 --> 31:24.674
Yes. Hello.

31:25.133 --> 31:26.676
Mr. Waldman?

31:27.511 --> 31:29.136
I got your number from a Realtor...

31:29.304 --> 31:32.431
in Massachusetts,
and I'd just like to speak to you.

31:32.599 --> 31:34.141
Who is this?

31:34.810 --> 31:36.310
You tell me, Mr. Waldman.

31:37.187 --> 31:38.938
Charly.

31:39.565 --> 31:41.148
My full name, please.

31:42.818 --> 31:44.402
God.

31:44.570 --> 31:46.946
It's really you.

31:49.074 --> 31:51.534
Chapter, they think you're dead.

31:51.702 --> 31:53.578
- Everyone thinks...
- My full name, please.

31:53.745 --> 31:54.912
You don't know your name?

31:57.332 --> 32:01.752
Charlene Elizabeth Baltimore.

32:01.920 --> 32:04.088
Don't talk, Charly. Just listen.

32:04.256 --> 32:06.591
You could be in danger. Understand?

32:06.758 --> 32:08.175
We must meet.

32:08.343 --> 32:10.678
We must meet straightaway.
Where are you now?

32:12.431 --> 32:13.639
Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania.

32:13.807 --> 32:15.516
We'll meet halfway.

32:15.684 --> 32:18.853
There's a town in New Jersey,
Chestermon.

32:19.021 --> 32:21.564
Tomorrow, Central Train Station...

32:21.732 --> 32:23.733
at 11 a.m.

32:23.900 --> 32:25.526
Meet me.

32:25.694 --> 32:27.486
I'll tell you everything.

32:33.201 --> 32:35.536
Signal Daedalus. We got her.

32:38.665 --> 32:40.875
- Some what?
- Curry brand cat food.

32:41.043 --> 32:43.836
- Could you spell that?
- Yeah. Curry brand.

32:44.004 --> 32:45.379
All this shit is the same.

32:45.547 --> 32:47.715
You don't happen to have a cat
by any chance...?

32:47.883 --> 32:49.884
What do I need a cat for? I got a girl.

32:50.052 --> 32:51.552
Yeah. Pussy's pussy.

32:51.720 --> 32:53.262
You got a girl, I got a cat.

33:03.565 --> 33:05.650
Mom, can I stay up for Rugrats?

33:05.817 --> 33:07.234
What, sweetie? I lost you.

33:07.402 --> 33:08.778
Rugrats. I want to stay up.

33:08.945 --> 33:11.489
- Yes. You can stay up for Rugrats.
- Oh, good.

33:12.324 --> 33:13.616
I'm gonna go now.

33:13.784 --> 33:15.326
All right.

33:15.494 --> 33:17.453
- Mommy loves you.
- I love you too.

33:17.621 --> 33:18.913
Big kiss.

33:19.081 --> 33:20.289
- Bye, Mom.
- Good night.

33:23.085 --> 33:25.252
Put my glasses in my pocket

33:27.923 --> 33:29.882
Put the jacket on the chair

33:36.264 --> 33:40.810
I sing the things I do, you know,
so I won't forget.

33:41.269 --> 33:42.269
Like:

33:44.314 --> 33:46.023
Turning off the downstairs light

33:47.776 --> 33:49.402
Before I go to bed at night

33:54.866 --> 33:56.033
Shit.

33:57.077 --> 34:00.204
I can't take this fucking waiting.

34:00.956 --> 34:03.916
Excuse me.
Do you normally curse this much?

34:04.626 --> 34:06.127
I didn't...

34:06.878 --> 34:08.129
What, are you a Mormon?

34:08.797 --> 34:09.922
Yes, I'm a Mormon.

34:10.090 --> 34:13.634
That's why I just smoked a pack of Newport
and drank three vodka tonics.

34:13.802 --> 34:15.094
What I'm saying is...

34:15.262 --> 34:16.804
back when we first met...

34:16.972 --> 34:20.641
you were all like, "Oh, phooey.
I burned the darn muffins."

34:21.143 --> 34:25.312
Now, you go into a bar, 10 minutes later,
sailors come running out.

34:25.480 --> 34:26.605
What up with that?

34:27.440 --> 34:29.358
Thanks for sharing.

34:29.568 --> 34:31.819
Mind your own damn business.

34:31.987 --> 34:34.321
While you're at it,
if you're gonna smoke inside...

34:34.489 --> 34:36.489
close the damn door.

36:39.698 --> 36:41.115
No!

36:42.117 --> 36:43.367
Hey, I heard you screaming.

36:43.535 --> 36:44.743
Shit!

36:52.210 --> 36:54.795
Henessey, I didn't know about the gun.

36:54.963 --> 36:57.131
I wasn't hiding things. I swear.

36:57.299 --> 36:58.632
Goddamn it. Stop walking.

36:58.800 --> 36:59.800
I'm going home.

36:59.968 --> 37:01.594
- Hey!
- And so are you!

37:01.761 --> 37:03.387
I paid you!

37:03.555 --> 37:07.016
Well, here. Here.
Take your money. Take it!

37:08.518 --> 37:10.311
I can't go home...

37:10.729 --> 37:12.855
until I know why that man
tried to kill me.

37:13.023 --> 37:15.649
I'm trapped.
It's like I'm in goddamn prison.

37:15.817 --> 37:18.485
- Do you know how that feels?
- Yeah!

37:18.653 --> 37:20.863
Yeah, I know exactly what that's like.

37:21.031 --> 37:23.490
Four years inside! Marion, Illinois.

37:23.742 --> 37:25.451
A real shithole.

37:25.619 --> 37:28.162
And I'm not going back!

37:52.979 --> 37:56.690
Seven years ago I was an Atlanta cop.

37:56.858 --> 38:00.361
Me and my partner handled
a lot of impounded shit.

38:00.528 --> 38:02.947
That motherfucker hated me.

38:03.114 --> 38:05.908
I forget why, but he did.

38:06.076 --> 38:09.453
Well, one weekend,
when he was conveniently away...

38:09.621 --> 38:12.957
some bonds disappeared
from his office.

38:13.333 --> 38:17.544
Lo and behold, when my brothers in blue
responded to an anonymous tip...

38:17.712 --> 38:21.090
you'll never guess what they found
sitting in my closet.

38:22.217 --> 38:24.802
The bonds. Your partner put them there.

38:24.970 --> 38:26.887
Oh, no, no, no. I did.

38:27.055 --> 38:29.056
I stole the damn things.

38:38.566 --> 38:41.902
I never did one thing right in my life,
you know that?

38:42.070 --> 38:43.904
Not one.

38:44.072 --> 38:45.990
That takes skill.

38:59.295 --> 39:01.088
You just missed our exit.

39:02.382 --> 39:04.466
Give me back my money.

39:04.968 --> 39:06.010
Oh, so you're...?

39:06.177 --> 39:09.847
I'm taking you to the train station, yes,
to meet Mr. Waldman.

39:11.099 --> 39:12.099
Merry Christmas.

39:12.267 --> 39:13.642
Bah, humbug.

39:13.852 --> 39:16.353
Look out the window and shut up.

39:37.292 --> 39:39.960
You know we're about 10 minutes early.

39:45.300 --> 39:47.259
Got a bad feeling about this.

40:01.107 --> 40:03.067
Putting the keys in my left pocket

40:04.611 --> 40:06.195
Gun in the right-hand side

40:06.362 --> 40:07.821
Makes a bulge. People can see.

40:07.989 --> 40:10.240
Want me to stick it in my pants,
shoot my dick off?

40:10.408 --> 40:11.658
You're a sharpshooter?

40:19.918 --> 40:22.294
Going to shake hands with the man

40:24.422 --> 40:25.756
- How you doing?
- Hi.

40:27.801 --> 40:29.259
That's for you.

40:32.222 --> 40:35.432
Another in a long line
of bad personal investments.

40:35.600 --> 40:37.184
Excuse me?

40:37.352 --> 40:39.019
I just saw the ring on your finger.

40:46.861 --> 40:49.196
Do I know you from somewhere?

40:49.364 --> 40:50.656
Back up.

40:50.824 --> 40:53.659
Total pickup line.
Forget I said it. I take it back.

40:54.577 --> 40:57.996
Thank you for the beer,
but I don't know you. No.

41:00.166 --> 41:02.209
No, you don't.

41:03.211 --> 41:07.422
And I can tell
when someone's lying to me.

41:07.590 --> 41:10.634
I am sorry to have bothered you.

41:12.595 --> 41:14.221
- Yours?
- Yeah.

41:14.389 --> 41:15.681
Who's your boyfriend?

41:15.849 --> 41:17.850
Oh, some guy.

41:19.060 --> 41:20.936
Okay, people. I got what I need.

41:21.104 --> 41:23.063
Move in. Do them both.

41:23.231 --> 41:24.481
Hey, hey.

41:24.649 --> 41:25.941
That man walking this way.

41:27.277 --> 41:28.402
Is that him?

41:28.570 --> 41:30.404
I think so.

41:38.788 --> 41:40.622
Mr. Waldman?

41:45.003 --> 41:46.170
Gun!

41:59.017 --> 42:00.601
Jesus wept.

42:00.810 --> 42:02.936
Let's go, Miss Caine.
We gotta get to the car.

42:03.104 --> 42:05.480
This way! This way! This way!
Come on! Come on! Go!

42:06.691 --> 42:09.401
No! No! No! Come on!

42:11.905 --> 42:14.489
Shit, there's more of them!
No! No! No! This way!

42:39.140 --> 42:41.183
Come on, come on, come on!

42:41.351 --> 42:44.061
Come on, Miss Caine! Come on!
Come on, goddamn it! Come on!

42:50.944 --> 42:52.319
- Where are they?
- Oh, shit!

42:52.487 --> 42:54.112
Here, take this. Take it. Take it.

42:54.280 --> 42:56.240
I got three shots left in this revolver.

42:56.407 --> 42:59.868
You got a full clip.
Just point and spray, okay?

43:00.203 --> 43:01.245
- Ready?
- Yeah.

43:01.412 --> 43:02.788
And...

43:03.623 --> 43:05.040
Fuck it! Run for your life!

43:08.461 --> 43:09.836
There's no way out!

43:15.009 --> 43:16.093
Jump!

43:16.261 --> 43:18.762
That's a three-story drop! Are you crazy?

43:47.333 --> 43:49.918
- What happened?
- I saved your ass. It was great.

43:50.086 --> 43:51.878
Come on. We gotta get to the car.

43:52.672 --> 43:55.424
Come on! Come on! This way! This way!
Come on. Come on.

43:55.591 --> 43:57.676
Get down! Get down! Get down!

44:06.644 --> 44:08.812
Get in, both of you. Now!

44:09.063 --> 44:10.063
I said, now!

44:18.656 --> 44:20.741
We jumped out of a building.

44:20.950 --> 44:23.702
Yes. It was very exciting.
Tomorrow, we go to the zoo.

44:23.870 --> 44:24.995
You're Waldman.

44:25.163 --> 44:26.913
No, I'm the Hills Bros.' bean buyer.

44:27.081 --> 44:28.457
Who else would I be? Hang on.

44:31.210 --> 44:34.713
If you want me to talk in front of him,
you may be asked to kill him later.

44:34.881 --> 44:35.922
- What?
- Your call.

44:36.090 --> 44:39.051
- What?
- Fire out the back if you have to.

44:39.427 --> 44:41.762
Jesus, old man.
How many of those things you got?

44:41.929 --> 44:44.598
Three. One shoulder, one hip,
and one next to Mr. Wally...

44:44.766 --> 44:46.433
where patdowns never reveal it...

44:46.601 --> 44:49.394
as an agent's often reluctant
to feel up a man's groin.

44:49.562 --> 44:52.689
- Any other questions?
- What's the weather like on your planet?

44:53.775 --> 44:55.108
Charlene, my darling.

44:55.276 --> 44:57.402
My name is Samantha. Samantha Caine.

44:57.570 --> 44:59.071
No, no, no! Forget all that.

44:59.238 --> 45:00.989
That teacher business was your cover.

45:01.157 --> 45:03.283
Do you hear me, Charly?
Hear what I'm saying?

45:03.451 --> 45:06.661
Your memory was gone. You got confused.
You bought your own cover.

45:06.829 --> 45:08.372
It was a fantasy, for chrissake!

45:08.539 --> 45:11.208
Samantha Caine never existed.
You wrote the bloody thing.

45:11.376 --> 45:15.087
No. It's not a fantasy.
I'm in the goddamn PTA.

45:15.254 --> 45:16.797
Then quit!

45:16.964 --> 45:20.133
You're an assassin
working for the United States government.

45:20.301 --> 45:21.718
I ought to know.

45:21.886 --> 45:23.261
I trained you.

45:25.807 --> 45:28.642
Get the fuck out of here! Ha, ha.

45:29.727 --> 45:31.812
Assassin? Ha, ha.

45:32.980 --> 45:37.442
Your father was in the Royal lrish Rangers,
assigned to Belfast.

45:38.194 --> 45:41.113
After he was murdered there in 1975...

45:41.280 --> 45:44.449
his friend Perkins adopted you.

45:44.867 --> 45:46.743
Or perhaps I should say recruited you...

45:46.911 --> 45:50.831
to work for Chapter, a black-bag operation
working from the U.S. State Department.

45:50.998 --> 45:52.666
You getting this?

45:52.834 --> 45:54.209
October, 1988.

45:54.377 --> 45:57.087
You're assigned to take out
a munitions dealer, Daedalus...

45:57.255 --> 45:59.047
and his hired enforcer, Timothy.

45:59.215 --> 46:01.341
You failed to complete your mission...

46:01.509 --> 46:05.178
electing instead to die, of all things,
despite clear orders to the contrary.

46:05.346 --> 46:07.848
And dead you remained until,
without preamble...

46:08.057 --> 46:11.601
you re-emerge eight years later
and a good deal frumpier.

46:15.857 --> 46:18.191
Anyhow, I think we can safely assume...

46:18.359 --> 46:21.111
that Daedalus is aware
of your resurrection...

46:21.654 --> 46:23.488
and attempting to reverse it.

46:23.656 --> 46:25.907
He'll be watching the police,
watching hospitals.

46:26.075 --> 46:27.492
We must stay away. Understand?

46:27.702 --> 46:29.661
Yes, Mr. Henessey? Can I help you?

46:29.829 --> 46:31.913
Henessey, what is it?

46:32.081 --> 46:33.874
It's a setup. It's gotta be.

46:34.083 --> 46:36.960
Put that down.
This is not an episode of television.

46:37.128 --> 46:40.922
Those guys back there at the train station,
how'd they know we'd be there?

46:41.090 --> 46:44.009
Impossible,
unless Waldman here told them.

46:44.177 --> 46:46.344
- I did not.
- They tapped your phone at least.

46:46.512 --> 46:48.096
I know it sounds preposterous...

46:48.264 --> 46:51.600
Oh, just happened to know we'd be calling?
Get in the car.

46:52.185 --> 46:53.643
See here, my friend...

46:54.562 --> 46:55.937
Oh, shit!

46:56.105 --> 46:58.315
Oh, damn!

47:01.235 --> 47:02.777
Get in the car now!

47:10.536 --> 47:11.703
So how about it?

47:11.871 --> 47:14.122
You believe any of that crap
he said back there?

47:14.290 --> 47:15.957
Oh, I don't... No.

47:16.125 --> 47:17.751
That guy was a lunatic.

47:17.919 --> 47:20.086
We gotta talk to someone else.

47:20.254 --> 47:21.755
You thinking what I'm thinking?

47:21.923 --> 47:25.217
I hope not, because I'm thinking
how much my balls hurt.

47:25.384 --> 47:29.262
But if you're talking about that postcard,
I don't wanna meet more of your friends.

47:29.430 --> 47:31.139
We have no choice.

47:31.307 --> 47:33.767
We need some answers
or we're gonna die.

48:06.801 --> 48:09.970
I saw you from the road.

48:11.973 --> 48:13.807
I think your name is Luke...

48:13.975 --> 48:17.269
and I think I was gonna marry you.

48:24.610 --> 48:25.652
Charly?

48:26.988 --> 48:29.072
Oh, baby. Hey.

48:29.240 --> 48:31.491
Oh, man.

48:32.451 --> 48:34.077
Luke.

48:35.496 --> 48:37.205
She's my only daughter...

48:37.415 --> 48:39.124
and I don't quite trust you yet.

48:42.920 --> 48:44.254
So, what about it?

48:44.422 --> 48:46.172
You and Mr. Outdoors here bump pelvis?

48:46.340 --> 48:47.507
It's possible.

48:47.842 --> 48:50.343
How about your daughter?

48:50.511 --> 48:52.345
- What's her name? Cat head?
- Caitlin.

48:52.513 --> 48:54.973
Yeah, well, you think
he might be the father?

48:55.141 --> 48:56.516
I don't know. I don't know.

48:56.684 --> 48:59.185
But all these little details about him
are coming back.

48:59.353 --> 49:00.895
I'm remembering things about him.

49:01.063 --> 49:02.230
Like what?

49:02.398 --> 49:06.318
Look, is this America's Funniest
Practical Videos or something?

49:06.485 --> 49:08.361
Keep your hands where I can see them.

49:09.739 --> 49:10.989
I had an itch.

49:11.907 --> 49:14.034
Charly, this is crazy.

49:14.201 --> 49:16.328
You and me, we were like...

49:20.541 --> 49:22.834
Don't you remember?
Hell, you pursued me.

49:24.670 --> 49:27.088
I know that he has a pin in his leg.
Car accident.

49:27.256 --> 49:29.049
I know he... He cuts his own hair.

49:29.216 --> 49:30.467
He doesn't even own a TV.

49:30.635 --> 49:32.135
He sits down when he pees...

49:32.303 --> 49:35.055
Hey, that's enough.
I'm getting a boner here, all right?

49:35.222 --> 49:37.432
Henessey, I know this man, okay?

49:37.600 --> 49:39.225
I must have been seeing him.

49:39.560 --> 49:40.977
Let me talk to him.

49:41.145 --> 49:42.687
Alone.

49:46.400 --> 49:47.567
I'm sorry.

49:47.735 --> 49:49.694
You wanna take a walk?

49:56.327 --> 49:57.744
Got me a handgun

50:00.247 --> 50:01.623
Got a rifle too

50:03.876 --> 50:05.752
Anybody fucks with Mitch

50:05.920 --> 50:08.713
He knows just what to do

50:08.923 --> 50:12.801
'Cause I'm a bad motherfucker

50:14.095 --> 50:16.596
Stay quiet and drop the rifle.

50:22.812 --> 50:23.978
How'd you find us?

50:24.146 --> 50:25.980
There may be reasons not to kill you...

50:26.148 --> 50:29.109
but among them is not
that you'll be missed by NASA.

50:29.276 --> 50:31.111
I found the address in your coat.

50:32.697 --> 50:33.738
Here.

50:33.906 --> 50:35.740
Between the address of a topless bar...

50:35.908 --> 50:38.284
and the picture of what looks
like a man's penis.

50:38.452 --> 50:40.745
That's a duck, not a dick.

50:41.956 --> 50:43.998
The man she's with, who is he?

50:44.166 --> 50:46.292
He's her former fiancé. His name's Luke.

50:46.460 --> 50:48.169
- Former fiancé?
- Hey, hey, hey.

50:48.337 --> 50:50.213
That's ridiculous.
She was never engaged.

50:50.381 --> 50:52.465
For chrissake,
I went through this with her.

50:52.633 --> 50:54.676
She knows how the man pees.

50:55.052 --> 50:57.053
Look at him. He's cool.

50:57.221 --> 50:58.972
A former fiancé.

50:59.140 --> 51:00.807
Why on earth would she think that?

51:00.975 --> 51:03.518
We found a note. It's in her handwriting.

51:03.686 --> 51:06.688
- She saw a note?
- Who are you, William Shatner? Calm down.

51:06.856 --> 51:08.481
Yeah, a note to her uncle.

51:08.649 --> 51:10.358
- Max?
- Yeah.

51:11.652 --> 51:14.738
Uncle Max.
That's the agency, you blithering idiot.

51:14.905 --> 51:18.074
And the word "engaged" means
she's locked on to target. Fuck!

51:18.242 --> 51:20.285
He's not her former lover, he's a target?

51:20.453 --> 51:24.122
That's why she knows personal things.
She studied the bastard to assassinate him.

51:24.290 --> 51:25.331
Stop!

51:25.499 --> 51:26.499
- Charly!
- Stop!

51:26.667 --> 51:28.126
- Charly!
- He's Daedalus!

51:28.669 --> 51:30.211
- Get out of there!
- It's him!

51:30.379 --> 51:32.338
He is Daedalus, Charly!

52:05.790 --> 52:07.415
Well, howdy there.

52:07.583 --> 52:10.084
If it isn't the forgetful spy.
How you feeling?

52:11.670 --> 52:13.171
You're the man from the bar.

52:13.339 --> 52:15.715
Would you look at her?
She's not faking it.

52:15.883 --> 52:17.842
She doesn't know me from Adam.

52:18.010 --> 52:22.222
It's not that I don't trust my
compadre here, Major Baltimore.

52:22.431 --> 52:25.975
In fact, I had every confidence
that your amnesia was genuine...

52:26.143 --> 52:27.435
until you showed up here.

52:27.978 --> 52:29.729
You follow?

52:29.897 --> 52:32.482
I'm trying to pull off the biggest job
of my career...

52:32.650 --> 52:37.612
so you see, darling,
I have to know how much about me...

52:37.780 --> 52:41.908
you really remember, and who you told.

52:43.118 --> 52:45.453
I haven't told a soul. I swear.

52:46.455 --> 52:48.164
We'll soon know.

52:50.626 --> 52:53.127
What is this? Some kind of torture thing?

52:53.295 --> 52:55.213
Torture, yes.

52:55.381 --> 52:57.799
A woman's face
never looks quite so beautiful...

52:57.967 --> 53:00.677
as when it's distended in pain.

53:00.845 --> 53:03.847
Witness the beauty of childbirth.

53:04.014 --> 53:07.225
- Untie me and I'll make any face you want.
- Let's not and say we did.

53:08.477 --> 53:11.521
Take a deep breath.
We're gonna do the torture thing.

53:48.475 --> 53:50.810
Operation Honeymoon's on schedule.

53:50.978 --> 53:52.979
I've secured the tanker.

53:53.147 --> 53:54.647
Now I just gotta make the soup.

53:54.815 --> 53:57.984
I'll follow as soon as I'm done here.

53:59.320 --> 54:02.572
Ten minutes in this cold water,
she'll be insane or dead.

54:02.740 --> 54:05.783
Five minutes.
She'll tell me everything I need.

54:24.511 --> 54:28.306
That's right. Take all the air you can.

54:28.474 --> 54:30.767
If you need to vomit, do it now.

54:30.935 --> 54:36.105
So you
don't remember anything at all?

54:36.690 --> 54:38.524
Best night of your fucking life.

54:40.527 --> 54:41.819
I say drown the wench.

54:43.781 --> 54:45.114
Talk to me, major.

54:45.574 --> 54:47.075
Is my identity safe?

54:47.242 --> 54:50.578
My name is Samantha Caine.

54:52.790 --> 54:54.916
Answer the question.

54:55.334 --> 54:56.918
Who knows about me?

54:57.086 --> 54:59.879
Nobody. Fuck you!

55:00.673 --> 55:01.714
Fuck you!

55:04.593 --> 55:07.387
I hate to see you like this, Charly.

55:09.723 --> 55:12.058
I heard you were a hell of a spy once.

55:14.103 --> 55:16.270
Watch your back.

55:16.438 --> 55:18.022
I'm not done yet.

55:18.190 --> 55:19.983
Good night.

55:47.094 --> 55:49.095
Okay. I'll signal Daedalus.

55:49.263 --> 55:51.431
Your money will be waiting.

55:52.474 --> 55:54.434
Jack?

55:54.601 --> 55:56.310
Jack. Jack!

55:57.104 --> 55:58.479
Do yourself a favor, man.

55:58.647 --> 56:00.481
Don't let her looks fool you.

56:00.649 --> 56:02.608
She's the Energizer fucking Bunny.

56:02.776 --> 56:05.028
Just do her and dump her.

56:05.195 --> 56:07.196
Don't try to get cute
and play doctor first.

56:07.364 --> 56:10.450
I made that mistake. It nearly killed me.

56:35.726 --> 56:37.393
Motherfucker!

57:03.420 --> 57:05.129
Daedalus...

57:05.339 --> 57:06.672
I'll make you a deal.

57:07.549 --> 57:09.175
Let me go now...

57:09.343 --> 57:12.512
and I'll leave you the use of your legs.

57:14.431 --> 57:17.141
Why have you resurfaced?

57:18.352 --> 57:20.311
Is it Operation Honeymoon? Is that it?

57:20.979 --> 57:22.897
Who sent you?

57:23.065 --> 57:24.649
Why are you here?

57:25.818 --> 57:28.820
I let you touch me, cowboy.

57:30.405 --> 57:33.366
I think I need a bath.

59:11.256 --> 59:14.425
Samantha, please.

59:14.885 --> 59:15.927
Who's Samantha?

59:18.597 --> 59:20.097
Where's Henessey?

01:01:15.589 --> 01:01:18.632
The lengthening of its neck
makes it easier for it to swim.

01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:20.301
Its front feet are larger...

01:01:20.469 --> 01:01:23.637
and that's good, to have paddle-like
feet to move through water...

01:01:44.326 --> 01:01:46.535
Hey, Mitch.

01:01:49.289 --> 01:01:50.331
You're awake.

01:01:56.129 --> 01:01:58.381
You're seeping.

01:01:58.965 --> 01:02:01.050
Here. Look at this.

01:02:04.137 --> 01:02:06.055
Shit.

01:02:06.223 --> 01:02:08.724
That hurt like shit.

01:02:09.184 --> 01:02:11.852
I know. That's why I distracted you first.

01:02:12.020 --> 01:02:13.896
Same principle as deflowering virgins.

01:02:14.606 --> 01:02:16.857
What? Virg...? What?

01:02:17.025 --> 01:02:18.818
I read it in this Harold Robbins book.

01:02:18.985 --> 01:02:21.195
Guy bites her on the ear,
distracts from the pain.

01:02:21.363 --> 01:02:22.405
You ever try that?

01:02:23.323 --> 01:02:26.700
No, no. I sock them in the jaw
and yell, "Pop goes the weasel."

01:02:26.868 --> 01:02:28.202
Who the fuck are you?

01:02:28.370 --> 01:02:29.495
The name's Charly.

01:02:29.663 --> 01:02:31.163
The spy.

01:02:31.331 --> 01:02:32.706
Nice to meet you.

01:02:34.835 --> 01:02:36.335
Drink?

01:02:36.962 --> 01:02:38.421
Yeah.

01:02:39.464 --> 01:02:42.216
Now, as you can see,
things are still very crazy here...

01:02:42.384 --> 01:02:44.093
but the sheriff has told me this:

01:02:44.261 --> 01:02:47.138
There have been gunshots, and yes...

01:02:48.348 --> 01:02:49.598
Okay, let's say I buy it.

01:02:50.142 --> 01:02:52.101
You are a trained killer.

01:02:55.730 --> 01:02:58.774
I can't even say that with a straight face.

01:02:58.942 --> 01:03:00.860
So Samantha, she...

01:03:01.027 --> 01:03:02.319
Never really existed.

01:03:02.487 --> 01:03:05.781
Like Nathan said,
she was a total fabrication.

01:03:05.949 --> 01:03:07.741
I made her up.

01:03:08.201 --> 01:03:12.204
So now she's just gone
forever and ever?

01:03:12.372 --> 01:03:13.664
Thank God.

01:03:13.832 --> 01:03:15.749
Look at my inordinately large ass.

01:03:15.917 --> 01:03:18.043
Look what she did to me.

01:03:18.211 --> 01:03:20.421
Pretty convincing act.

01:03:20.589 --> 01:03:22.131
I guess.

01:03:22.299 --> 01:03:26.010
You know, her personality
had to come from somewhere.

01:03:26.386 --> 01:03:28.179
Change the subject.

01:03:28.346 --> 01:03:29.889
Better yet, bring me that bottle.

01:03:34.478 --> 01:03:35.811
Here you go. Drink up.

01:03:38.648 --> 01:03:40.065
So, what's next?

01:03:40.233 --> 01:03:41.275
What do we do now?

01:03:41.443 --> 01:03:43.527
I contact Chapter.

01:03:43.695 --> 01:03:45.070
I come in for debriefing...

01:03:45.238 --> 01:03:47.114
bury the last eight years...

01:03:47.282 --> 01:03:48.908
get back to work.

01:03:49.075 --> 01:03:50.868
Cheers.

01:03:53.538 --> 01:03:55.748
Would you believe it, Harry?

01:03:56.458 --> 01:03:59.126
We got an appropriations review
in three weeks...

01:03:59.294 --> 01:04:02.046
and the president wants to know
how I lost an agent.

01:04:02.839 --> 01:04:04.924
Yes, sir. You have a call on line 3, sir.

01:04:05.091 --> 01:04:06.342
Gonna tell me who it is?

01:04:06.801 --> 01:04:08.052
Charly Baltimore, sir.

01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:13.432
Run a trace.

01:04:17.103 --> 01:04:18.646
This is Mr. Perkins.

01:04:18.813 --> 01:04:19.980
Turn on the TV.

01:04:20.148 --> 01:04:22.191
Farm in New Jersey. Seven dead.

01:04:22.359 --> 01:04:24.443
Charly.

01:04:24.611 --> 01:04:27.196
Good Lord, girl.
We've been looking all over for you.

01:04:27.364 --> 01:04:30.908
I got a photo of you in a Christmas parade.
What the hell is happening?

01:04:31.076 --> 01:04:32.785
Don't be stupid.

01:04:32.953 --> 01:04:34.662
I completed my assignment.

01:04:35.872 --> 01:04:37.248
You mean Daedalus?

01:04:37.415 --> 01:04:39.750
I shot him. He's pretty much dead.

01:04:39.918 --> 01:04:42.753
Actually, I would have done it earlier,
say back in '92...

01:04:42.921 --> 01:04:45.214
but I was baking. Don't ask.

01:04:45.715 --> 01:04:46.882
I wanna come in.

01:04:47.551 --> 01:04:51.053
Sure. Of course.

01:04:51.221 --> 01:04:52.888
Let me direct you to a safe house.

01:04:53.723 --> 01:04:56.308
Forget it. We play it my way.

01:04:56.476 --> 01:04:58.894
You want me back, then you stay away.
I'll call you.

01:04:59.062 --> 01:05:00.771
Those are the rules, understand?

01:05:03.191 --> 01:05:04.400
Shit.

01:05:10.490 --> 01:05:11.865
Did you hear that?

01:05:12.075 --> 01:05:13.701
If she got to Daedalus...

01:05:13.868 --> 01:05:16.537
she could know about Honeymoon.

01:05:16.705 --> 01:05:20.165
She might know that old targets
have become your new best friends.

01:05:20.333 --> 01:05:22.209
That could be trouble.

01:05:22.377 --> 01:05:23.419
Goddamn you.

01:05:23.587 --> 01:05:25.796
There were weapons at that farm.
She's armed now.

01:05:25.964 --> 01:05:28.173
Stop having kittens.

01:05:28.341 --> 01:05:31.719
You're the head of a major spy network,
and you have a tendency to whine.

01:05:31.886 --> 01:05:32.970
Do you realize that?

01:05:33.138 --> 01:05:36.056
She could compromise
this entire operation.

01:05:36.516 --> 01:05:38.809
We have 24 hours.

01:05:38.977 --> 01:05:40.352
We find her...

01:05:41.479 --> 01:05:42.605
then we kill her.

01:05:43.273 --> 01:05:45.024
Do whatever it takes, but be careful.

01:05:46.151 --> 01:05:47.693
If it gets out you work for me...

01:05:47.861 --> 01:05:50.362
I'll be grabbing my ankles
on the White House lawn.

01:05:51.031 --> 01:05:54.033
The lady's wacked, Trin.
She's lost it. I gotta get out of here.

01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:55.534
Look, I need you to meet me.

01:05:55.702 --> 01:05:59.371
I'll sneak back out to this phone
and call you at midnight with the details.

01:05:59.539 --> 01:06:00.873
Bye.

01:06:02.459 --> 01:06:04.376
All right, Sam. What did that accomplish?

01:06:04.544 --> 01:06:06.128
I'm testing our boy Perkins.

01:06:06.338 --> 01:06:08.047
Got a light?

01:06:09.341 --> 01:06:10.758
I don't really trust him.

01:06:11.301 --> 01:06:12.843
Come again?

01:06:14.638 --> 01:06:16.430
A little experiment.

01:06:16.598 --> 01:06:20.184
If he was looking for me in Pennsylvania,
he sure as hell tapped your office.

01:06:20.352 --> 01:06:22.436
You mean he just traced that call?

01:06:22.604 --> 01:06:24.396
Come midnight, you hang by the phone.

01:06:24.898 --> 01:06:26.231
If he wants to erase me...

01:06:26.399 --> 01:06:29.568
he'll send someone to kidnap
and torture you for my whereabouts...

01:06:29.736 --> 01:06:32.112
in which case, hey, I don't trust him.

01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:35.115
No, no, no. Time out.

01:06:48.922 --> 01:06:51.507
I haven't had a date in eight years, Mitch.

01:06:53.927 --> 01:06:55.594
Is this a fun date?

01:07:00.392 --> 01:07:01.433
What's going on?

01:07:03.019 --> 01:07:06.230
True love. Shut the fuck up.

01:07:09.943 --> 01:07:11.360
Beautiful.

01:07:11.528 --> 01:07:13.987
White lady seducing the colored help.

01:07:14.781 --> 01:07:16.031
Get real, sweetheart.

01:07:16.199 --> 01:07:18.242
I ain't handsome, I ain't rich...

01:07:18.410 --> 01:07:22.579
and the last time I got blown,
candy bars cost a nickel.

01:07:22.747 --> 01:07:23.956
What's going on?

01:07:24.124 --> 01:07:26.792
Chemistry. Go figure.

01:07:27.627 --> 01:07:29.670
Chemistry, my ass.

01:07:29.838 --> 01:07:31.964
You know what I think?

01:07:32.132 --> 01:07:34.341
I think this is why you'd fuck me.

01:07:37.929 --> 01:07:39.638
To kill a schoolteacher.

01:07:39.806 --> 01:07:42.641
To bury her once and for all.

01:07:42.809 --> 01:07:44.435
I kind of liked that schoolteacher.

01:07:44.602 --> 01:07:46.729
When she comes back,
give me a call, all right?

01:07:49.274 --> 01:07:50.858
Oh, and call your fucking kid.

01:07:51.025 --> 01:07:52.317
It's two days to Christmas.

01:07:52.485 --> 01:07:55.904
She might be under the mistaken impression
Mommy gives a fuck.

01:07:56.698 --> 01:07:58.782
I didn't ask for the kid.

01:07:58.950 --> 01:08:01.660
Samantha had the kid, not me.

01:08:02.829 --> 01:08:04.830
Nobody asked me.

01:08:12.130 --> 01:08:14.548
Merry Christmas.

01:08:19.763 --> 01:08:22.514
Good evening, pretty lady.
How about some company?

01:08:22.682 --> 01:08:25.850
No, thanks.
I'm saving myself till I get raped.

01:08:26.019 --> 01:08:27.853
Step in the alley.

01:08:29.856 --> 01:08:31.689
I ain't asking you. I'm telling you.

01:08:32.567 --> 01:08:33.609
Fuck.

01:08:35.361 --> 01:08:39.406
Goddamn it. You're early.
So Perkins wants me dead?

01:08:39.573 --> 01:08:40.991
What's the rush?

01:08:42.535 --> 01:08:44.745
Why don't you go away
and come back at midnight?

01:08:44.912 --> 01:08:45.953
Shoo.

01:08:46.122 --> 01:08:49.082
Hey, honey, this is a real big fucking gun.

01:08:50.335 --> 01:08:53.962
- This ain't no ham on rye, pal.
- What the hell are you doing?

01:08:54.130 --> 01:08:55.421
Saving your life.

01:08:55.590 --> 01:08:58.341
I would've come sooner,
but I was thinking up that line.

01:08:58.510 --> 01:09:00.511
You think I can't take him?

01:09:00.678 --> 01:09:02.845
- Probably scared the others away.
- What others?

01:09:03.014 --> 01:09:04.055
Headhunters, nimrod.

01:09:04.224 --> 01:09:05.599
They don't travel alone.

01:09:05.767 --> 01:09:08.227
Were you always this stupid,
or did you take lessons?

01:09:08.394 --> 01:09:09.728
- I took lessons.
- Hey.

01:09:09.895 --> 01:09:11.604
What?

01:09:11.773 --> 01:09:13.689
I still got this fucking gun.

01:09:29.999 --> 01:09:32.000
Fuck this.

01:09:32.794 --> 01:09:34.877
Put that away.

01:09:35.546 --> 01:09:37.548
I'm out of here.

01:09:50.310 --> 01:09:51.979
Perkins, you prick.

01:09:52.145 --> 01:09:54.106
Now you want me dead. Why?

01:09:54.274 --> 01:09:56.191
What's going on?

01:09:57.861 --> 01:10:00.362
Easy, sport.
I got myself out of Beirut once.

01:10:00.530 --> 01:10:02.489
I think I can get out of New Jersey.

01:10:02.657 --> 01:10:05.617
Yeah? Well, don't be so sure.
Others have tried and failed.

01:10:05.785 --> 01:10:08.537
The entire population, in fact.

01:10:09.998 --> 01:10:14.042
You keep saying "I" this,
"I" that, like, well...

01:10:14.961 --> 01:10:17.546
It's like you don't need me anymore.

01:10:18.298 --> 01:10:20.090
Good point.

01:10:20.258 --> 01:10:21.758
Hey, hey, hey.

01:11:05.219 --> 01:11:06.720
Get in.

01:11:18.524 --> 01:11:20.817
Found a use for me?

01:11:21.277 --> 01:11:22.319
Yep.

01:11:23.404 --> 01:11:24.988
I'm leaving the country, Mitch.

01:11:25.156 --> 01:11:27.950
I need a fake passport,
and I need money, lots of it.

01:11:28.117 --> 01:11:29.743
Well, why didn't you say so?

01:11:29.911 --> 01:11:32.245
Hold on a minute
while I pull that out of my ass.

01:11:32.413 --> 01:11:33.497
The key, Mitch.

01:11:33.665 --> 01:11:35.499
The one I keep on that charm bracelet?

01:11:35.667 --> 01:11:38.001
It opens Box 227 in a bank in Buffalo.

01:11:38.169 --> 01:11:40.712
How the fuck would you know?
The numbers are filed off.

01:11:41.673 --> 01:11:43.215
I filed them off.

01:11:43.383 --> 01:11:45.342
There's a briefcase in Box 227.

01:11:45.510 --> 01:11:47.010
It's got cash and IDs in it.

01:11:47.971 --> 01:11:49.388
I need you to get them for me.

01:11:51.432 --> 01:11:53.225
Shit. I should have known.

01:11:53.393 --> 01:11:54.518
Okay.

01:11:54.686 --> 01:11:56.353
So where's this charm bracelet?

01:11:56.896 --> 01:12:00.899
Yeah, well, that's the thing
about being a secret agent, Mitch.

01:12:01.067 --> 01:12:02.442
Nothing is ever simple.

01:12:26.426 --> 01:12:27.759
Drive past. Don't slow down.

01:12:28.511 --> 01:12:30.303
You can park under those trees.

01:12:31.222 --> 01:12:32.597
Honk if there's any trouble.

01:12:32.765 --> 01:12:35.308
Yes, Miss Daisy. I be honking.

01:12:49.699 --> 01:12:51.658
Good morning, Raymond.

01:12:52.118 --> 01:12:53.827
Good morning, Miss Caine.

01:12:53.995 --> 01:12:56.121
What did we learn
about the dangers of smoking?

01:12:56.289 --> 01:12:57.914
Give it here.

01:13:02.712 --> 01:13:05.338
Thanks. Tell anyone you saw me...

01:13:05.506 --> 01:13:07.758
I'll blow your fucking head off.

01:15:28.232 --> 01:15:29.774
Fuck.

01:15:32.236 --> 01:15:34.070
Shoot the son of a bitch.

01:15:35.364 --> 01:15:36.406
Oh, shit.

01:16:42.848 --> 01:16:44.641
Hi.

01:16:55.695 --> 01:16:58.113
You're about to have 2.4 children.

01:16:58.281 --> 01:16:59.447
Oh, please.

01:17:00.700 --> 01:17:02.200
Merry Christmas.

01:17:07.665 --> 01:17:08.957
So how far to the money?

01:17:09.125 --> 01:17:10.166
Hour, tops.

01:17:11.043 --> 01:17:13.378
I haven't seen a cop in a while.

01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:17.382
So, Mitch...

01:17:19.927 --> 01:17:21.594
still think I'm warm and fuzzy?

01:17:21.762 --> 01:17:23.763
Oh, yeah, sure.

01:17:23.931 --> 01:17:25.515
Anything?

01:17:25.683 --> 01:17:28.727
Phone bill, Christmas card.

01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:31.896
You could've aimed
for those guys' shoulders.

01:17:32.064 --> 01:17:34.190
- Back off, man.
- Ha, ha.

01:17:35.026 --> 01:17:38.695
You know, I'm thinking maybe
Samantha Caine wasn't an act.

01:17:40.114 --> 01:17:41.906
Yeah, you had amnesia and all...

01:17:42.074 --> 01:17:45.577
but I think maybe you forgot
to hate yourself for a while. How about it?

01:17:47.413 --> 01:17:49.205
What the fuck is that?

01:17:50.583 --> 01:17:52.125
Oh.

01:18:02.928 --> 01:18:04.054
Hello?

01:18:04.221 --> 01:18:05.680
It's me. I got your kid.

01:18:06.557 --> 01:18:09.851
Give your location. Don't waste time.

01:18:13.064 --> 01:18:14.689
State Road 5...

01:18:14.857 --> 01:18:18.443
15 minutes east
of Union Springs, New York.

01:18:18.611 --> 01:18:21.196
I don't like cellular phones,
so here's how we do this.

01:18:21.364 --> 01:18:23.031
Go to the Holiday Inn nearest you.

01:18:23.199 --> 01:18:25.033
There's one in Cayuga.

01:18:25.201 --> 01:18:27.202
Be there when I call in 15 minutes.

01:18:31.332 --> 01:18:32.499
Who?

01:18:34.794 --> 01:18:36.336
He's got the kid.

01:18:36.504 --> 01:18:38.296
Timothy?

01:18:38.756 --> 01:18:42.384
He's routing me to a landline.
Doesn't want to talk over the airwaves.

01:18:42.551 --> 01:18:44.511
Oh, shit.

01:18:50.559 --> 01:18:51.684
Maybe we can trace him.

01:18:52.269 --> 01:18:54.521
Trace him? How? It's a random hotel.

01:18:54.688 --> 01:18:56.898
- How long did he give you?
- Fifteen minutes.

01:18:57.108 --> 01:18:58.733
Okay.

01:19:00.152 --> 01:19:01.820
Why don't we try the phone company?

01:19:02.696 --> 01:19:05.448
Think you can get here
in under 15 minutes?

01:19:11.247 --> 01:19:13.248
Nobody move.

01:19:15.543 --> 01:19:16.918
You.

01:19:17.086 --> 01:19:19.712
You've got 40 seconds
to run a patch for me.

01:19:19.922 --> 01:19:21.381
Everybody up. Against the wall.

01:19:30.850 --> 01:19:33.017
Holiday lnn. Chet speaking.

01:19:33.185 --> 01:19:35.520
I'd like to page
Charlene Baltimore, please.

01:19:35.688 --> 01:19:36.896
Please hold.

01:19:41.652 --> 01:19:42.694
Yeah.

01:19:42.862 --> 01:19:44.988
Hi. It's me.

01:19:45.614 --> 01:19:47.449
No shit. Verify you have the kid.

01:19:47.616 --> 01:19:50.034
How else would I get
your cellular number?

01:19:50.202 --> 01:19:52.162
I got it off the cast on her right wrist.

01:19:53.080 --> 01:19:55.540
Right below "Mommy loves you."

01:19:55.708 --> 01:19:59.669
I offer up a simple trade.
You for the girl.

01:19:59.837 --> 01:20:01.546
I'll tell you where and when.

01:20:01.755 --> 01:20:02.964
And, Charly...

01:20:03.424 --> 01:20:05.592
you fuck with me...

01:20:06.051 --> 01:20:09.971
I'll blind the kid
and shoot out her knees.

01:20:16.145 --> 01:20:18.229
Give me an ANI trace.

01:20:18.397 --> 01:20:20.023
Do it.

01:20:26.906 --> 01:20:29.157
How do you know so much
about this Timothy?

01:20:29.325 --> 01:20:31.659
Oh, what do you think?
I bumped pelvises with him.

01:20:33.078 --> 01:20:34.537
He was a target, remember?

01:20:35.748 --> 01:20:37.290
Ma'am?

01:20:37.791 --> 01:20:39.959
That call was placed from Niagara Falls.

01:20:40.836 --> 01:20:42.337
Niagara Falls?

01:20:44.673 --> 01:20:46.925
Operation Honeymoon.

01:20:47.092 --> 01:20:48.134
Bingo.

01:21:33.222 --> 01:21:34.264
Perkins.

01:21:35.558 --> 01:21:36.599
What's he doing here?

01:21:46.277 --> 01:21:49.112
Timothy acting alone, we had a chance.

01:21:51.907 --> 01:21:53.324
Charly's hooked.

01:21:53.492 --> 01:21:56.452
All we gotta do is set a time and a place.

01:22:01.542 --> 01:22:04.127
My God. We're monsters.

01:22:05.337 --> 01:22:07.005
You talk to me about Honeymoon.

01:22:08.507 --> 01:22:09.841
Tanker's ready.

01:22:10.009 --> 01:22:12.885
One terrorist on ice waiting to play patsy.

01:22:13.345 --> 01:22:16.848
- And no loose ends?
- No, no. Not that I can tell.

01:22:17.016 --> 01:22:21.686
Feds are gonna find them crashed
in a ravine five miles from the blast site.

01:22:31.030 --> 01:22:33.323
I'm not a complete ogre.

01:22:34.992 --> 01:22:38.161
The young one gets a doll
to play with for Christmas.

01:22:39.288 --> 01:22:41.456
Oh, fuck you.

01:22:46.462 --> 01:22:49.130
- I think I should go in first.
- Negative.

01:22:49.298 --> 01:22:50.673
You'd just screw it up.

01:22:51.342 --> 01:22:54.218
Hey, I'm a much better shot up close.

01:22:54.386 --> 01:22:56.554
You couldn't hit a lake
if you were on the bottom.

01:22:56.722 --> 01:22:57.889
Forget it.

01:22:59.391 --> 01:23:00.933
Here.

01:23:01.727 --> 01:23:04.979
The guards are at 126.9 megahertz.

01:23:05.147 --> 01:23:09.651
You meet me at 127.1
if you need to talk.

01:23:10.694 --> 01:23:15.156
As soon as you spot me with the kid,
you start laying down cover fire.

01:23:17.326 --> 01:23:18.409
All right.

01:23:23.123 --> 01:23:25.583
They're gonna blow my head off,
you know.

01:23:27.961 --> 01:23:30.463
This is the last time I'll ever be pretty.

01:24:05.416 --> 01:24:06.999
Northeast sector, all clear.

01:24:07.167 --> 01:24:08.960
Roger, Northeast.

01:25:11.982 --> 01:25:13.024
Bogey.

01:25:17.905 --> 01:25:21.365
Round her up, gentlemen.
I want her alive and unmarked.

01:25:22.284 --> 01:25:23.868
Run. She's got the kid.

01:26:02.616 --> 01:26:03.825
I smell gasoline.

01:26:03.992 --> 01:26:05.660
Did you have a little accident?

01:26:06.161 --> 01:26:09.539
I got plenty of matches up here.
It would be a bad way for a kid to go.

01:26:09.706 --> 01:26:12.083
Thirty seconds. Think it over.

01:26:25.889 --> 01:26:28.349
- Oh!
- Pick him up.

01:26:32.271 --> 01:26:33.855
I'm gonna miss you, major.

01:26:34.481 --> 01:26:35.898
You ought to have stayed dead.

01:26:36.066 --> 01:26:37.692
You don't know the rules anymore.

01:26:37.860 --> 01:26:41.863
Tell me about it. Eight years ago,
this guy was on the hit list.

01:26:42.030 --> 01:26:44.323
Budget cuts, dear.

01:26:45.784 --> 01:26:48.369
Congress blinded us overseas.

01:26:49.246 --> 01:26:51.998
I was forced to turn
to any eyes and ears I could find...

01:26:52.165 --> 01:26:56.419
even if that meant recruiting
the quote-unquote "bad guys" here.

01:26:58.088 --> 01:27:01.424
Budget cuts, is that what this is about?

01:27:02.217 --> 01:27:04.302
Operation Honeymoon.

01:27:05.178 --> 01:27:07.847
Fuck me. You're running a fundraiser.

01:27:08.015 --> 01:27:09.181
Fundraiser?

01:27:09.683 --> 01:27:11.893
1993.

01:27:12.060 --> 01:27:15.521
World Trade Center bombing, remember?

01:27:16.648 --> 01:27:21.819
During the trial, one of the bombers
claimed the CIA had advanced knowledge.

01:27:23.864 --> 01:27:27.366
The diplomat who issued
the terrorists' visa was CIA.

01:27:27.826 --> 01:27:31.120
It's not unthinkable they paved the way
for the bombing...

01:27:31.288 --> 01:27:33.664
purely to justify a budget increase.

01:27:33.832 --> 01:27:38.044
You're gonna fake some terrorist thing
just to scare some money out of Congress?

01:27:38.211 --> 01:27:39.962
Well, unfortunately, Mr. Henessey...

01:27:40.130 --> 01:27:42.715
I have no idea
how to fake killing 4000 people.

01:27:44.176 --> 01:27:46.886
So we're just gonna have to do it for real.

01:27:47.387 --> 01:27:49.096
Oh, blame it on the Muslims, naturally.

01:27:50.223 --> 01:27:52.350
Then I get my funding.

01:27:52.517 --> 01:27:54.560
Good night, old girl.

01:27:55.062 --> 01:27:57.063
- Timothy, I'll be in Chopper 1.
- All right.

01:28:02.027 --> 01:28:04.487
No, no, no. Just her.

01:28:06.156 --> 01:28:07.865
Sam.

01:28:08.659 --> 01:28:10.910
I'll be waiting for you to come rescue me.

01:28:11.787 --> 01:28:12.912
Be just a minute.

01:28:14.247 --> 01:28:15.873
Hey.

01:28:23.548 --> 01:28:26.342
So you plant this poor Arab
to take the fall.

01:28:26.551 --> 01:28:28.052
What's going out in the tanker?

01:28:29.554 --> 01:28:30.721
Come on.

01:28:30.889 --> 01:28:32.431
I'm gonna die. I wanna know.

01:28:34.101 --> 01:28:35.935
Okay.

01:28:36.603 --> 01:28:38.521
Chemical bomb.

01:28:39.314 --> 01:28:41.440
Chain reaction.

01:28:41.775 --> 01:28:43.401
Once started, it can't be stopped.

01:28:44.152 --> 01:28:47.196
The catalyst injected
into the tanker heats up.

01:28:47.364 --> 01:28:50.992
We pull the truck
into the center of town.

01:28:51.743 --> 01:28:54.120
It goes critical around midnight.

01:28:54.871 --> 01:28:57.123
Farewell. Adieu.

01:28:58.500 --> 01:29:00.751
- Timothy.
- Yeah?

01:29:00.919 --> 01:29:02.628
Please...

01:29:03.422 --> 01:29:05.548
let my kid go.

01:29:06.008 --> 01:29:09.593
I'm about all out of favors, there, Chuck.

01:29:09.761 --> 01:29:13.472
But I'm already letting you spend time
with the kid while you freeze to death.

01:29:13.640 --> 01:29:15.808
Now, they're...

01:29:16.977 --> 01:29:21.105
They're gonna find your bodies
somewhere in Pennsylvania.

01:29:21.648 --> 01:29:25.443
And you're just gonna be written off
as some crazy mommy...

01:29:25.610 --> 01:29:27.737
who kidnapped her own kid...

01:29:27.904 --> 01:29:29.655
died with her in a blizzard.

01:29:29.823 --> 01:29:31.032
Goddamn you.

01:29:31.742 --> 01:29:33.784
Look at her eyes.

01:29:33.952 --> 01:29:35.578
Now, why would I wanna do that?

01:29:35.746 --> 01:29:37.455
Because they're yours.

01:29:38.707 --> 01:29:42.626
That night with you, I got pregnant.

01:29:43.837 --> 01:29:45.838
The little girl is your daughter.

01:29:52.846 --> 01:29:54.388
That's priceless.

01:29:56.308 --> 01:29:58.976
Would you bring my little bitch in here?

01:30:07.819 --> 01:30:09.070
Caitlin.

01:30:11.239 --> 01:30:13.240
Hi, princess.

01:30:13.408 --> 01:30:15.868
You mind if I take a look
at your fucking eyes?

01:30:30.092 --> 01:30:32.176
It's all right, Caity.

01:30:32.552 --> 01:30:34.804
We're gonna take a nap together.

01:30:34.971 --> 01:30:36.722
We'll be like the bears in the winter.

01:30:36.890 --> 01:30:39.600
Yeah, bears. Okay.
Thank you. Thank you.

01:30:48.610 --> 01:30:49.777
It ain't over.

01:30:54.032 --> 01:30:55.866
You're gonna die screaming.

01:30:57.953 --> 01:30:59.912
And I'm gonna watch.

01:31:03.458 --> 01:31:05.501
Am I telling the truth?

01:31:20.600 --> 01:31:22.518
Mommy, it's cold in here.

01:31:22.686 --> 01:31:24.228
Just for a minute.

01:31:24.396 --> 01:31:26.730
Polar bears, remember?

01:32:32.339 --> 01:32:33.881
Open.

01:33:00.283 --> 01:33:02.493
Step over there, sweetie.

01:33:05.830 --> 01:33:07.831
Give me a spark.

01:33:15.131 --> 01:33:16.548
Hi, Mitch.

01:33:16.716 --> 01:33:18.342
Sorry to keep you waiting.

01:33:18.510 --> 01:33:21.011
For you, Tim, always a pleasure to wait.

01:33:21.179 --> 01:33:26.141
I wanted to tell you this story.
The Grinch, like a mean fucker, but...

01:33:30.855 --> 01:33:32.773
Come on. Do it.

01:33:32.941 --> 01:33:34.108
Do it!

01:33:34.276 --> 01:33:36.735
It being Christmas Eve,
I'm gonna give you a choice.

01:33:37.487 --> 01:33:41.031
The knife or the gun.

01:33:44.995 --> 01:33:46.704
Do it.

01:33:56.381 --> 01:33:58.799
Mommy, don't cry.

01:34:01.344 --> 01:34:04.305
I keep these here for lighting your candle.

01:34:08.601 --> 01:34:09.935
Oh, Caity.

01:34:11.813 --> 01:34:13.689
I love you.

01:34:13.857 --> 01:34:15.065
Sam called Washington.

01:34:15.233 --> 01:34:17.526
By morning,
this place will be crawling with feds.

01:34:17.694 --> 01:34:19.445
We're gonna be gone by then, Mitch.

01:34:19.946 --> 01:34:21.572
That's what I'm saying.

01:34:21.740 --> 01:34:25.034
A couple of feds said they couldn't sleep,
so they might come early.

01:34:25.201 --> 01:34:28.579
That tanker goes bang
at 312 degrees Celsius.

01:34:28.747 --> 01:34:30.748
Right in the center of town...

01:34:31.124 --> 01:34:33.292
25 minutes from now.

01:34:33.460 --> 01:34:35.836
Mommy, am I gonna die?

01:34:36.004 --> 01:34:37.546
Oh, no, baby.

01:34:37.714 --> 01:34:40.424
No, you're not gonna die.

01:34:41.509 --> 01:34:43.344
They are.

01:34:43.511 --> 01:34:45.220
Cover your ears.

01:34:45.388 --> 01:34:48.098
Hey, should we get a dog?

01:34:55.190 --> 01:34:56.857
Bye, Mitch.

01:35:00.487 --> 01:35:01.779
Thanks for coming.

01:35:25.345 --> 01:35:26.387
Oh, shit.

01:35:28.640 --> 01:35:31.225
I know! Watch your fire!

01:35:33.353 --> 01:35:35.521
Ha, ha. You foxy bitch.

01:35:43.988 --> 01:35:45.030
- Mommy.
- Run, Caity.

01:35:49.369 --> 01:35:50.869
Hide.

01:35:57.168 --> 01:35:58.836
Caity.

01:36:06.261 --> 01:36:09.346
Yeah, Sam, they don't know
who they're fucking with.

01:36:14.310 --> 01:36:16.812
- Skin looks fine.
- Yeah, looks all right from here.

01:36:21.860 --> 01:36:23.944
Where the fuck is that kid going?

01:36:27.198 --> 01:36:28.824
Shit.

01:36:37.333 --> 01:36:39.877
Move it out! And find that bitch.

01:36:42.130 --> 01:36:43.964
All right, people, listen up.

01:36:44.132 --> 01:36:46.133
Nothing changes.

01:36:46.301 --> 01:36:49.178
Icy roads, five miles past the town limit.

01:36:49.345 --> 01:36:51.221
Plant the car in the ravine...

01:36:51.389 --> 01:36:53.682
and get your asses out of there.

01:36:54.392 --> 01:36:55.851
Where'd you go, baby?

01:36:56.019 --> 01:36:57.811
Show Mommy.

01:36:58.313 --> 01:36:59.354
Sam.

01:36:59.522 --> 01:37:00.898
Sam, are you out there?

01:37:01.566 --> 01:37:03.275
Sam, where are you?

01:37:03.443 --> 01:37:05.235
Mitch. I don't believe it.

01:37:06.237 --> 01:37:08.864
I just saw Caitlin climb
in the back of the truck.

01:37:09.032 --> 01:37:10.908
She's locked in the toolbox, left rear.

01:37:11.117 --> 01:37:12.659
Jesus. The truck is a bomb.

01:37:12.827 --> 01:37:14.620
Tell me something I don't know.

01:37:14.787 --> 01:37:15.913
Timothy rigged it.

01:37:16.122 --> 01:37:18.457
Three hundred-twelve degrees,
it goes boom.

01:37:18.666 --> 01:37:19.917
We got 20 minutes, tops.

01:37:21.002 --> 01:37:22.294
I'll go in and get her.

01:37:22.462 --> 01:37:23.837
- No chance.
- I'm close.

01:37:24.005 --> 01:37:26.298
I make it a dozen
with automatic weapons.

01:37:26.466 --> 01:37:29.051
So kill them for me, bitch.
What are you good for?

01:37:33.431 --> 01:37:35.474
Okay, you can do this.

01:37:35.683 --> 01:37:36.767
Mitch, no.

01:37:36.935 --> 01:37:38.852
Just do one thing right.

01:37:39.020 --> 01:37:40.521
Talk to me, Mitch.

01:37:40.688 --> 01:37:42.940
- Please.
- Mitch.

01:37:47.946 --> 01:37:49.071
Goddamn it.

01:37:49.239 --> 01:37:51.198
Your 9, Mitch, on your 9.

01:37:55.537 --> 01:37:58.413
Thirty degrees left, Mitch. Left.

01:37:59.040 --> 01:38:00.374
Your other left.

01:38:07.757 --> 01:38:09.758
They got you flanked.

01:38:10.343 --> 01:38:11.593
Mitch, get out, now!

01:38:16.099 --> 01:38:17.766
Mitch! Shit!

01:38:25.024 --> 01:38:26.066
Mitch.

01:38:37.495 --> 01:38:39.496
Move it out. Let's go.

01:39:18.328 --> 01:39:21.079
Okay, listen up.
She's gonna make a try for the payload...

01:39:21.247 --> 01:39:23.540
so Units 2 and 4, watch your backs.

01:39:23.708 --> 01:39:25.584
Sky 1, get me a chopper in the air.

01:39:25.793 --> 01:39:26.960
I'm on my way. Out.

01:39:53.905 --> 01:39:55.739
Let me through.

01:39:57.784 --> 01:39:58.909
Coming through.

01:40:06.501 --> 01:40:07.542
Out.

01:40:14.926 --> 01:40:17.511
Clear out of the way.
This truck's gonna blow up.

01:40:19.305 --> 01:40:20.931
Move.

01:40:28.064 --> 01:40:29.272
Sir, she's got the truck.

01:40:29.440 --> 01:40:30.982
She's headed out of town.

01:40:31.150 --> 01:40:33.610
I'm hurt real bad. I think I'm dying.

01:40:33.778 --> 01:40:36.488
Continue dying. Out.

01:40:36.656 --> 01:40:38.573
Head her off, please.

01:40:52.797 --> 01:40:54.464
Oh, fuck.

01:40:56.467 --> 01:40:58.510
No. No!

01:40:58.678 --> 01:41:00.053
Oh, not fair.

01:41:00.638 --> 01:41:02.055
Not fucking fair.

01:41:02.807 --> 01:41:04.683
Get out of the way.

01:41:12.483 --> 01:41:13.608
Hang on, Caity.

01:41:21.743 --> 01:41:25.454
Suck my dick, every one of you bastards.

01:41:48.436 --> 01:41:50.187
- Shit.
- Shit.

01:42:44.242 --> 01:42:46.618
Oh, honey, only four inches?

01:42:47.370 --> 01:42:49.371
You'll feel me.

01:43:01.092 --> 01:43:02.342
No!

01:43:12.937 --> 01:43:14.312
No!

01:43:53.603 --> 01:43:55.562
Mommy.

01:44:06.657 --> 01:44:08.241
She must be in the truck.

01:44:10.161 --> 01:44:11.786
Get away from her.

01:44:14.582 --> 01:44:16.374
- Mom.
- No!

01:44:33.559 --> 01:44:34.976
Help.

01:44:36.187 --> 01:44:37.479
Caity.

01:44:39.857 --> 01:44:42.192
- Caity.
- Mommy, I hit my head.

01:44:42.360 --> 01:44:43.777
Come on.

01:44:49.408 --> 01:44:51.326
Okay. Hold on.

01:44:56.916 --> 01:45:00.210
Caity, run.

01:45:00.378 --> 01:45:01.544
Get out.

01:45:01.712 --> 01:45:03.880
Don't go away again, please.

01:45:04.048 --> 01:45:06.132
Caity, the truck is a bomb.

01:45:07.551 --> 01:45:08.802
It's gonna blow up.

01:45:09.220 --> 01:45:10.804
Go.

01:45:11.806 --> 01:45:13.765
I'm right behind you, baby.

01:45:15.017 --> 01:45:17.310
Go, and don't look back.

01:45:21.023 --> 01:45:22.983
Good girl.

01:45:42.420 --> 01:45:44.587
Here! Over here!

01:45:44.755 --> 01:45:47.382
Mommy, no.

01:45:54.724 --> 01:45:56.850
It's okay.

01:45:57.643 --> 01:45:59.436
I'm sorry I left.

01:45:59.937 --> 01:46:01.730
Please get up.

01:46:10.865 --> 01:46:13.616
Charlie Team 1, we're in position
and ready to advance.

01:46:13.784 --> 01:46:15.243
Charlie 1, that's a negative.

01:46:15.411 --> 01:46:18.121
Orders are to stand down until notified.

01:46:21.292 --> 01:46:23.626
Would you stop it?

01:46:23.794 --> 01:46:26.254
Stop being a little baby.

01:46:27.465 --> 01:46:29.924
Get up now. You're not dead.

01:46:34.889 --> 01:46:36.014
Don't you die.

01:46:36.182 --> 01:46:38.641
You get up now.

01:46:39.643 --> 01:46:41.102
Life is pain.

01:46:41.687 --> 01:46:44.647
You just get used to it.

01:46:45.066 --> 01:46:48.735
So stand up right this minute, Mommy.

01:47:23.062 --> 01:47:24.771
You're grounded.

01:47:33.030 --> 01:47:35.115
Get me to the bridge.

01:47:35.866 --> 01:47:38.368
I'm not leaving till I know
that bitch is dead.

01:48:03.352 --> 01:48:05.895
Somebody help me.

01:48:10.317 --> 01:48:12.068
I got a kid here.

01:48:12.236 --> 01:48:15.530
I got my 8-year-old daughter,
do you hear me?

01:48:16.031 --> 01:48:19.200
Somebody get this motherfucker off me.

01:48:21.453 --> 01:48:23.746
- Help me.
- Negative, ma'am.

01:48:23.914 --> 01:48:25.999
We understand your request, but...

01:48:30.921 --> 01:48:33.923
That's right.
You can't kill me, motherfuckers.

01:48:47.062 --> 01:48:49.063
Sam!

01:48:49.231 --> 01:48:50.565
Mitch.

01:48:51.734 --> 01:48:53.234
Hurry.

01:48:57.448 --> 01:48:59.407
- Get in.
- Sam.

01:49:02.203 --> 01:49:04.037
Stay here. Here.

01:49:05.706 --> 01:49:07.207
- I'm here.
- Sam.

01:49:07.374 --> 01:49:08.458
I'm here, you bastard.

01:49:09.710 --> 01:49:10.835
I'm here, you bastard!

01:49:37.112 --> 01:49:38.821
Die screaming, motherfucker.

01:49:44.536 --> 01:49:47.830
Don't let her get to the border!
They're heading for the border!

01:49:47.998 --> 01:49:49.499
Go!

01:50:39.383 --> 01:50:41.259
Don't hit the cars.

01:51:08.454 --> 01:51:10.204
Sorry.

01:51:10.748 --> 01:51:12.999
I can't drive anymore.

01:51:13.167 --> 01:51:14.709
Okay.

01:51:15.836 --> 01:51:17.253
Are you okay?

01:51:18.339 --> 01:51:20.548
Are you stupid?

01:51:27.348 --> 01:51:28.514
Hey, gorgeous.

01:51:30.976 --> 01:51:33.561
You got your mommy's eyes.

01:51:34.772 --> 01:51:37.565
Don't let nobody tell you different.

01:51:42.279 --> 01:51:44.947
Hey, hang in there, partner.

01:51:45.115 --> 01:51:47.492
Did you forget we're rich?

01:51:56.543 --> 01:51:57.585
Hello?

01:51:57.753 --> 01:52:00.213
I'm putting your call
through to the president.

01:52:00.381 --> 01:52:02.382
- Hello, Miss Caine.
- Yes, Mr. President.

01:52:03.050 --> 01:52:04.133
I owe you.

01:52:04.301 --> 01:52:07.678
The country owes you
a debt of tremendous gratitude.

01:52:08.389 --> 01:52:12.642
I wonder, would I be out of line if I asked
you to come back into government...

01:52:12.810 --> 01:52:14.310
work for the State Department?

01:52:14.478 --> 01:52:15.978
Out of the question, sir.

01:52:16.146 --> 01:52:17.855
I've got a stack of papers to grade.

01:52:18.023 --> 01:52:21.317
The money involved would be substantial.

01:52:21.985 --> 01:52:24.570
You'd be surprised how much
a good teacher can earn.

01:52:24.738 --> 01:52:26.739
Oh, gosh, I know.

01:52:26.907 --> 01:52:30.034
And I am working on it,
but it's for next term.

01:52:30.869 --> 01:52:34.914
Before I go, sir,
there is a small favor I'd like to ask.

01:52:35.082 --> 01:52:36.541
Welcome to Larry King Live.

01:52:36.708 --> 01:52:39.502
Tonight we seek closure
in the matter of Leland Perkins...

01:52:39.670 --> 01:52:42.547
indicted on six counts of high treason.

01:52:42.714 --> 01:52:46.592
Joining us tonight
is CIA Section Chief Walter Hodge.

01:52:46.760 --> 01:52:48.177
He's in Langley, Virginia.

01:52:48.929 --> 01:52:50.638
At our studios in New York City...

01:52:50.806 --> 01:52:53.808
intelligence analyst
Jack E. Wadsworth.

01:52:54.643 --> 01:52:58.354
And in our studios here tonight
is Pittsburgh native Mitchell Henessey...

01:52:58.522 --> 01:53:00.398
who, at a surprise press conference...

01:53:00.566 --> 01:53:03.526
was singled out
by the president of the United States...

01:53:03.694 --> 01:53:05.278
for his role in this affair.

01:53:05.446 --> 01:53:07.905
As the expression goes, "That ain't hay."

01:53:08.073 --> 01:53:10.616
- Thanks for coming.
- Thank you, Mr. K, for having me.

01:53:10.784 --> 01:53:14.412
Mitch, you have had
one hell of a Christmas Eve...

01:53:14.580 --> 01:53:18.624
and we have heard from our reporter Carla
Krebs, on the scene in Niagara Falls...

01:53:18.792 --> 01:53:21.335
when she heard this story,
she didn't believe it.

01:53:21.503 --> 01:53:24.547
Well, what Carla failed to realize,
Mr. King...

01:53:24.715 --> 01:53:28.217
is that I'm always frank
and earnest with women.

01:53:28.385 --> 01:53:29.552
In New York, I'm Frank.

01:53:29.720 --> 01:53:31.888
In Chicago, I'm Earnest.

01:53:38.479 --> 01:53:40.480
Good boy.

01:53:49.072 --> 01:53:51.866
Yeah, I could just sit out here forever.

01:53:52.034 --> 01:53:53.659
Couldn't you?

01:53:54.305 --> 01:54:00.822
