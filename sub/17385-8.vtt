you get it accurate.

08:35.780 --> 08:37.447

through all the details?

08:37.448 --> 08:41.418
Uh, you know, areare
these official sto spec?

08:41.419 --> 08:43.921
This is 181st style TIE Fighter.

08:43.922 --> 08:47.190
You've got bracers over here, gauntlets.

08:47.191 --> 08:49.126
This is actually a shin pad.

08:49.127 --> 08:51.028
You have an actual modified flight suit.

08:51.029 --> 08:53.130
The pockets are all very specific.

08:53.131 --> 08:55.999
The hoses are actually
from various things.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.601
This is a vacuum hose.

08:57.602 --> 08:59.469
So, uh, what about the
Stormtrooper costume?

08:59.470 --> 09:01.939
My Stormtrooper costume
is, uh, fan sculpt.

09:01.940 --> 09:03.974
It was sculpted with correct details,

09:03.975 --> 09:05.475
accurate to the movie,

09:05.476 --> 09:07.144
including using, uh, casts

09:07.145 --> 09:08.779
of the actual aerator part

09:08.780 --> 09:10.881
that is the mictip detail.

09:10.882 --> 09:12.149
The button patterns,

09:12.150 --> 09:14.384
the way everything is is in here

09:14.385 --> 09:16.186
is made to look just
like it was in the movies.

09:16.187 --> 09:18.855
There's a little elastic
strap in the back.

09:18.856 --> 09:21.391
I mean, we're talking
super, super detailed.

09:21.392 --> 09:23.060
What's it madels it made,
like, outout of Kevlar?

09:23.061 --> 09:24.795
Plastic. It's all plastic?

09:24.796 --> 09:26.530
All plastic. Won't stop blaster bolts.

09:26.531 --> 09:28.332
Yeah. [chuckling] Yeah, that's right.

09:28.333 --> 09:29.967
They didn't stop the blaster
bolts in the movies either,

09:29.968 --> 09:31.001
so, I mean [laughter]

09:31.002 --> 09:32.536
Yeah.

09:32.537 --> 09:35.839
I got to be a Stormtrooper
in "The Force Awakens. "

09:35.840 --> 09:37.874
Now, I didn't get to
be the guy in the suit,

09:37.875 --> 09:41.979
but J.J. had me do a voice
for one of the Stormtroopers.

09:41.980 --> 09:43.880
Gave me five different scenes to do,

09:43.881 --> 09:46.316
and he said, "I'll figure
out which one you are

09:46.317 --> 09:48.552
later on when I'm putting
the movie together. "

09:48.553 --> 09:50.187
It's crazy, dude, and then
at the end of the movie,

09:50.188 --> 09:52.856
there was my name in the blue font.

09:52.857 --> 09:54.491
I almost wanted to go back in time

09:54.492 --> 09:56.226

09:56.227 --> 09:58.261

09:58.262 --> 10:00.564
"One day your name's gonna
be in a 'Star Wars' movie,"

10:00.565 --> 10:02.199
and that little boy would be like,

10:02.200 --> 10:03.600
"We're gonna direct 'Star Wars?'"

10:03.601 --> 10:05.102
I'd be like, "Oh, no, no, kid.

10:05.103 --> 10:06.737
No, no, no, no, that's
for better people. "

10:06.738 --> 10:08.705

Nope. No physical exam.

10:16.214 --> 10:17.381

10:25.890 --> 10:27.424

I mean, is there any chance

10:27.425 --> 10:28.692

underneath those costumes?

10:40.138 --> 10:41.605

world of "Star Wars" cosplay,

11:02.336 --> 11:04.170
- who would you want to be?
- I'm gonna go simple.

11:04.171 --> 11:06.139

and go as Obi-Wan Kenobi.

Oh, I just can't get a bald cap,

- and some red powder?
- It's so weird.

but I'd want to be Vader.

11:27.661 --> 11:30.330
Great costume, but you're
definitely gonna need the lifts.

11:30.331 --> 11:32.098
Not if you stand next to Ming, though.

11:32.099 --> 11:33.099

"He's no good to me dead. "

So wait a minute, what is this thing?

17:10.284 --> 17:11.785
This thing is actually a cooler.

17:11.786 --> 17:13.286
Basically, it was, like, a display unit.

17:13.287 --> 17:14.788
They used to fill it up with ice.

17:14.789 --> 17:16.056
Oh, 'cause you can
throw the sodas in there.

17:16.057 --> 17:17.390
Yeah.

That's why it says "Brisk" on it.

"The Phantom Menace" in 3D

17:21.561 --> 17:22.963

17:22.964 --> 17:24.698

If I remember correctly

17:39.380 --> 17:40.747
in... in "Force Awakens,"

R2D2 shut down because
Master Luke went away.

that you didn't do any work,

out of depression, though.

- Why though?

18:00.001 --> 18:02.435
C-3PO is tolerated at best. [laughter]

18:02.436 --> 18:05.272
We all understand what he's saying,

18:10.011 --> 18:11.478
"Goodness gracious me. "

18:11.479 --> 18:13.780
Whereas R2D2 seems like the common man.

18:13.781 --> 18:16.483
You seem like you could have
a drink with a guy like R2D2.

18:16.484 --> 18:18.919
But he could say so much
with that "boopboobloo. "

18:18.920 --> 18:21.855
Totally. We can
anthropomorphize those noises.

18:21.856 --> 18:24.691
It wasn't just like,
"Beepbeepbeepbeepbeepbeep. "

18:24.692 --> 18:26.459
It was like, "Booboobooooo. "

18:26.460 --> 18:28.194
And you know you knew R2 was sad,

18:28.195 --> 18:29.796
and then you were sad.

18:29.797 --> 18:32.165
Yes, you can empathize with
this little piece of metal.

18:37.672 --> 18:39.206
that we should have in the Stash?

18:39.207 --> 18:40.874
What, if you fill it
up with ice every day

18:40.875 --> 18:42.309
and sell soda to people?

18:42.310 --> 18:43.777
There you go. It'd pay for itself.

18:43.778 --> 18:45.112
The best part about it
is all you have to do

18:45.113 --> 18:46.680
is flip the drain in the back.

18:46.681 --> 18:48.182
Once the ice melts, it
just drains right out.

18:48.183 --> 18:49.950
So you just wheel it
out back by the dumpster

18:49.951 --> 18:51.785
and watch it urinate.

18:51.786 --> 18:54.288
[laughter]

18:54.289 --> 18:56.190
Isn't it a little undignified though

18:56.191 --> 18:59.126
for the droid who saved the
galaxy on numerous occasions?

18:59.127 --> 19:02.796
Jabba the Hutt made him a
uh, party droid bartender

19:02.797 --> 19:04.698
on the sail barge in
"Return of the Jedi,"

19:04.699 --> 19:06.366
so you'd just be playing it out.

19:06.367 --> 19:08.368
[laughter]
Yeah, and... and I think

19:08.369 --> 19:10.404
he'she's the perfect shape
for a beverage cooler, I think.

19:10.405 --> 19:11.872
He's also good for a garbage can.

19:11.873 --> 19:13.707
I mean, they even
call him a garbage can.

19:13.708 --> 19:15.676
And I wonder, have they marketed that?

19:15.677 --> 19:18.245
Is that where Lucasfilms draws the line?

19:18.246 --> 19:20.314
They're like, "We're not gonna
let you make him a garbage can. "

little children's, like,

19:22.150 --> 19:24.351

19:24.352 --> 19:26.186
- They did a potty of R2D2?
- Wow.

19:26.187 --> 19:27.821
I think they did.

there any damage to this?

be on the bottom feet,

it's not as pristine as we thought, huh?
