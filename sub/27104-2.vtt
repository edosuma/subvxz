WEBVTT

00:11.929 --> 00:14.682
(children shouting in distance)

00:24.316 --> 00:25.985
MIDGE:
Morning. I'm so happy

00:26.026 --> 00:27.445
you agreed to stay here
while my parents are gone.

00:27.486 --> 00:29.029
I really believe
if Harry Drake's goons

00:29.071 --> 00:30.948
can't find you,
they may just forget about you.

00:30.990 --> 00:32.908
Anyhow, some rules
you need to follow.

00:32.950 --> 00:35.161
Rule number one:
no eating in the living room.

00:35.202 --> 00:37.496
Rule number two:
touch nothing pink.

00:37.538 --> 00:38.831
Rule number three...

00:38.873 --> 00:41.751
Rule number 38:
do not touch Papa's robe.

00:43.794 --> 00:45.504
(sighs)

00:53.512 --> 00:55.306
(water running)

01:00.144 --> 01:02.146
(playing classical music)

01:07.026 --> 01:09.862
(repeats phrase)

01:09.904 --> 01:12.448
(playing single note repeatedly)

01:12.490 --> 01:14.617
(pitch adjusting)

01:18.662 --> 01:20.247
REDD FOXX: In the third place,
ain't nobody can eat

01:20.289 --> 01:23.334
-that much ice cream.
-(laughs)

01:23.375 --> 01:25.377
(crying)

01:35.137 --> 01:37.139
(indistinct chatter over TV)

01:41.143 --> 01:42.853
Shit.

01:56.367 --> 02:00.454
Eighteen and a half.

02:00.496 --> 02:03.332
Such a tiny fucking thigh.

02:03.374 --> 02:05.084
B. Altman.
Where may I direct your call?

02:05.125 --> 02:06.919
-I will connect you.
-Hey.

02:06.961 --> 02:09.338
-Oh, do you read?
-Occasionally.

02:09.380 --> 02:11.006
B. Altman.
Where may I direct your call?

02:11.048 --> 02:12.800
-I will connect you.
-So, I'm looking through

02:12.842 --> 02:14.718
the Village Voice,
just perusing the headlines,

02:14.760 --> 02:16.095
and look what I see.

02:16.136 --> 02:17.596
Well, you need
to turn it toward me

02:17.638 --> 02:19.098
-so I can...
-"Susie Myerson, the manager

02:19.139 --> 02:21.809
"of the underground
phenom comedienne Mrs. Maisel,

02:21.851 --> 02:24.019
says she's gonna be bigger
than Totie Fields."

02:24.061 --> 02:25.855
-Wait, what are you read...
Ah, shoot.
-(gasps)

02:25.896 --> 02:27.189
B. Altman.
Where may I direct your call?

02:27.231 --> 02:28.816
Isn't that crazy? Mrs. Maisel?

02:28.858 --> 02:31.026
-I mean, you're Mrs. Maisel.
-Hold, please.

02:31.068 --> 02:33.445
-Can I...?
-This comedian
has the same name as you.

02:33.487 --> 02:36.115
B. Altman. Where...
Oh, sorry. I thought I did.

02:36.156 --> 02:38.158
-I will connect you.
-The world is so small.

02:38.200 --> 02:40.452
I feel like I should be able
to subway to China.

02:40.494 --> 02:43.080
-Do you know her?
-I don't think so.

02:43.122 --> 02:44.748
-Is there a picture?
-No picture.

02:44.790 --> 02:46.625
You could be related.
She could be your cousin.

02:46.667 --> 02:49.628
Or your mother.
Is your mother a comedienne?

02:49.670 --> 02:51.755
-(laughs):
Wouldn't that be a scandal?
-Hmm.

02:51.797 --> 02:54.258
Oops. I guess all those
flashing lights are for me.

02:54.300 --> 02:56.010
B. Altman.
Where may I direct your call?

02:56.051 --> 02:58.053
-Ginger!
-Here.

02:58.095 --> 02:59.638
I will connect you.

02:59.680 --> 03:01.307
GINGER: B. Altman.
Where may I direct your call?

03:01.348 --> 03:03.058
I will connect you.

03:03.100 --> 03:05.436
-(door closes)
-Zelda?

03:05.477 --> 03:07.938
-(footfalls approaching)
-I ate the strudel,
and it was awesome.

03:07.980 --> 03:10.608
Who are you?

03:10.649 --> 03:11.984
-I...
-What are you doing here?

03:12.026 --> 03:13.444
-I...
-Why are you in the bathtub?

03:13.485 --> 03:14.820
Wait, I know this one.

03:14.862 --> 03:16.113
I don't know you.
You don't live here.

03:16.155 --> 03:17.406
-Are you a burglar?
-Uh...

03:17.448 --> 03:18.782
Did you break in here
to steal jewelry

03:18.824 --> 03:20.534
and then decide it would be
funny to take a bath?

03:20.576 --> 03:23.037
You look like Zelda but younger.
Are you Zelda but younger?

03:23.078 --> 03:25.372
No, I'm not.
I'm an actual friend

03:25.414 --> 03:27.541
of the people who live here,
and I am going to call the cops

03:27.583 --> 03:29.501
if you don't tell me who you are
and what you are doing

03:29.543 --> 03:31.587
-in this apartment.
-I know...

03:31.629 --> 03:35.215
the short... brunette...

03:35.257 --> 03:36.759
Midge? You're a friend of Midge?

03:36.800 --> 03:38.886
I know all her friends, and I
have never seen you before ever.

03:38.928 --> 03:40.220
Where do you know Midge from?
Where?

03:40.262 --> 03:41.722
-The club.
-What club?

03:41.764 --> 03:42.932
-The...
-Do not mumble.

03:42.973 --> 03:44.224
The Gaslight.

03:44.266 --> 03:46.894
The downtown dumpy,
sticky place?

03:46.936 --> 03:49.355
That still does not explain why
you are here in that bathtub,

03:49.396 --> 03:50.814
which is way too full
of bubbles, by the way.

03:50.856 --> 03:52.232
You don't need to use
the entire bottle.

03:52.274 --> 03:53.692
That's just overkill!

03:53.734 --> 03:55.235
I'm sorry.
I'm having a little trouble

03:55.277 --> 03:56.528
focusing here right now.

03:56.570 --> 03:58.948
(chuckles):
I'm very high,

03:58.989 --> 04:01.033
and there's just a lot of words

04:01.075 --> 04:03.327
coming from a little,
yellow light source,

04:03.369 --> 04:05.621
-and it's freaking me out.
-(door closes)

04:05.663 --> 04:07.873
It feels like a flower's
yelling at me.

04:07.915 --> 04:09.375
IMOGENE:
Midge.

04:09.416 --> 04:11.627
-Thank God.
-Imogene,
what are you doing here?

04:11.669 --> 04:13.212
Who is this thing
in your bathtub?

04:13.253 --> 04:15.047
Oh, th-that's, uh...

04:15.089 --> 04:17.341
Why don't we go in the kitchen?
I'll explain everything.

04:17.383 --> 04:18.926
You stay there.

04:18.968 --> 04:21.679
Where the fuck am I gonna go?

04:21.720 --> 04:23.222
-What are you doing here?
-What am I doing here?

04:23.263 --> 04:24.598
-What am I doing here?
-I just mean...

04:24.640 --> 04:26.141
I came to talk to you,
and I found that

04:26.183 --> 04:27.851
sitting in the tub
like a big potato in a soup pot.

04:27.893 --> 04:29.144
Her name is Susie,

04:29.186 --> 04:30.854
and her apartment
is getting fumigated.

04:30.896 --> 04:32.815
She says she knows you
from the club.

04:32.856 --> 04:34.566
Yes. When Joel would play there.

04:34.608 --> 04:36.276
Uh, maybe we could talk
about this later.

04:36.318 --> 04:38.153
I haven't heard word one
from you in weeks,

04:38.195 --> 04:39.571
and now you're trying
to get me to leave?

04:39.613 --> 04:41.740
You were in Iowa
for the holidays.

04:41.782 --> 04:43.784
Joel quit his job.
Did you know that?

04:43.826 --> 04:45.869
-What?
-Right in the middle
of their big presentation.

04:45.911 --> 04:48.038
He just walked in with all
the top brass sitting there

04:48.080 --> 04:50.332
and the fancy chart that I
helped Archie make, and he quit.

04:50.374 --> 04:52.042
-Oh.
-Why didn't you call to warn me?

04:52.084 --> 04:53.711
Well, you were in Iowa.

04:53.752 --> 04:55.587
Stop using Iowa
as an excuse for everything.

04:55.629 --> 04:57.923
My family may be dairy farmers,
but they have a phone.

04:57.965 --> 04:59.883
I didn't know
that he was going to quit.

04:59.925 --> 05:00.926
How could you not know?
I thought

05:00.968 --> 05:02.011
you were getting back together.

05:02.052 --> 05:03.429
Who told you
we were getting back together?

05:03.470 --> 05:04.805
-Archie.
-Who told Archie?

05:04.847 --> 05:06.473
-Joel.
-Oh.

05:06.515 --> 05:09.268
Well, I-I've been in Paris,
so I'm a little behind.

05:09.309 --> 05:12.354
-Paris? You were in Paris?
-Yes.

05:12.396 --> 05:14.356
Why didn't you tell me
you were going to Paris?

05:14.398 --> 05:16.817
-When did we stop being friends?
-We're friends, Imogene.

05:16.859 --> 05:18.444
If we were friends,
I would be the one

05:18.485 --> 05:20.529
-taking a bath in your tub.
-You have a tub.

05:20.571 --> 05:22.031
The point is
I don't know anything anymore.

05:22.072 --> 05:23.615
-I don't know you anymore.
-You do.

05:23.657 --> 05:25.325
You were in Paris.
That's in France.

05:25.367 --> 05:27.077
You didn't tell me you were
getting back together with Joel.

05:27.119 --> 05:29.038
-Archie did.
-I didn't
get back together with...

05:29.079 --> 05:31.290
It doesn't matter if it's true.
You should've told me.

05:31.331 --> 05:32.875
Just like you should've told me
that Joel was going to quit.

05:32.916 --> 05:34.334
-I didn't...
-What am I supposed to do now?

05:34.376 --> 05:36.295
With Joel gone,
Archie's a sitting duck.

05:36.336 --> 05:37.796
He was Joel's right-hand man.

05:37.838 --> 05:39.506
What if they retaliate
for what Joel did?

05:39.548 --> 05:40.924
They're not the mob, Imogene.

05:40.966 --> 05:42.134
I'm sorry I've been distant.

05:42.176 --> 05:43.594
And I am sorry about Joel.

05:43.635 --> 05:46.263
And believe me,
Archie is going to be okay.

05:46.305 --> 05:48.599
-How do you know?
-I'm brilliant.

05:48.640 --> 05:50.142
Look, I should get back
to Susie,

05:50.184 --> 05:52.061
but I will see you tomorrow
in exercise class?

05:52.102 --> 05:53.687
-You're coming?
-I'm coming.

05:53.729 --> 05:55.439
-You haven't been in weeks.
-I'll be there tomorrow.

05:55.481 --> 05:56.732
I was alone in the front.

05:56.774 --> 05:58.108
I had no one
to feel superior with.

05:58.150 --> 06:00.027
-Alone I just felt like a snob.
-Tomorrow.

06:00.069 --> 06:02.654
-I promise.
-Okay.

06:04.656 --> 06:06.825
And by the way,
it looks like your new friend

06:06.867 --> 06:08.285
used Rose's pink soap.

06:08.327 --> 06:10.746
No one uses Rose's pink soap.

06:17.586 --> 06:19.922
Enjoying your bath?

06:19.963 --> 06:21.507
Immensely.

06:21.548 --> 06:23.258
Just laying here, soaking.

06:23.300 --> 06:25.928
My brain's gone bye-bye.
Everything was perfect

06:25.969 --> 06:28.138
until the vanilla muffin
waltzed in here

06:28.180 --> 06:30.057
-and killed my buzz.
-What did you tell her?

06:30.099 --> 06:31.809
-Who?
-The muffin.

06:31.850 --> 06:33.143
Oh. I don't know.

06:33.185 --> 06:34.895
-You mentioned the Gaslight.
-No.

06:34.937 --> 06:36.563
I'm pretty sure
I didn't mention the Gaslight.

06:36.605 --> 06:37.689
You definitely mentioned
the Gaslight

06:37.731 --> 06:39.108
because she mentioned
the Gaslight.

06:39.149 --> 06:41.068
-She did?
-I have to know
what you're saying.

06:41.110 --> 06:42.694
To my friends. To the press.

06:42.736 --> 06:44.446
I know about that interview
you gave to the Village Voice.

06:44.488 --> 06:46.532
You didn't even ask me about it
before you did it.

06:46.573 --> 06:48.575
You just went ahead and--
Do not add more hot water.

06:48.617 --> 06:50.369
-So bossy.
-Get out of the tub.

06:50.410 --> 06:51.578
What? Why?

06:51.620 --> 06:53.580
Because I need to talk to you.

06:53.622 --> 06:55.374
Fine.

06:55.415 --> 06:58.043
-Well, go wait in the hall.
-Why?

06:58.085 --> 06:59.920
What do you mean, why?
I've measured myself.

06:59.962 --> 07:02.214
There's no way I'm gonna be
fucking naked in front of you.

07:07.052 --> 07:09.471
You can't just go around talking
to the press without telling me.

07:09.513 --> 07:12.266
Susie, that paper was
just sitting there. At my work.

07:12.307 --> 07:15.394
If Ginger wasn't so Ginger,
she would've figured it out.

07:15.435 --> 07:17.479
-What?
-You have to tell me

07:17.521 --> 07:20.274
-what you're saying about me
before you say it.
-Why?

07:20.315 --> 07:22.401
-What do you mean, why?
-I am your manager.

07:22.442 --> 07:24.486
It is literally my job
to talk about you.

07:24.528 --> 07:27.823
Yes. To club owners,
to bookers at the Stage Deli.

07:27.865 --> 07:29.700
But this was in print.
Anyone could read it.

07:29.741 --> 07:31.285
Thank God
there wasn't a picture.

07:31.326 --> 07:32.911
Ooh, I've been meaning
to talk to you about that.

07:32.953 --> 07:35.122
-We got to take some pictures.
-No.

07:35.164 --> 07:37.040
Look, press is part
of the game, lady.

07:37.082 --> 07:38.709
You want to know what
that little paragraph

07:38.750 --> 07:40.961
-in the paper got us?
-What?

07:41.003 --> 07:43.255
A gig. A real gig.

07:43.297 --> 07:45.382
A paying gig.
No passing the hat.

07:45.424 --> 07:47.092
A club with booze
and everything.

07:47.134 --> 07:48.886
Midtown? A midtown gig?

07:48.927 --> 07:51.555
-Almost. 15th Street.
-Wow.

07:51.597 --> 07:53.682
-Midway to midtown.
-That's right.

07:53.724 --> 07:55.434
We are midway to midtown.
Isn't it great?

07:55.475 --> 07:57.686
It is. But, Susie, promise,
just check with me

07:57.728 --> 07:59.354
before you give
any more interviews, please.

07:59.396 --> 08:02.107
-Why?
-Because I haven't
told anyone yet.

08:02.149 --> 08:03.984
What do you mean
you haven't told anyone yet?

08:04.026 --> 08:05.652
Your fucking husband
was standing right there.

08:05.694 --> 08:08.280
I know, but I haven't told
my friends or my parents.

08:08.322 --> 08:09.615
How have you not told
your parents?

08:09.656 --> 08:10.991
Don't you live
with these people?

08:11.033 --> 08:12.409
Where do they think you go
every night?

08:12.451 --> 08:14.077
-Out.
-Every night?

08:14.119 --> 08:15.996
-I'm very popular.
-Okay.

08:16.038 --> 08:17.372
I mean this
with all due respect.

08:17.414 --> 08:18.582
Your parents are fucking idiots.

08:18.624 --> 08:20.000
-I'm gonna tell them.
-When?

08:20.042 --> 08:22.669
-Soon.
-What are you waiting for?

08:22.711 --> 08:24.296
I thought you made
this decision already.

08:24.338 --> 08:26.006
-I thought you wanted
to go for it.
-I do.

08:26.048 --> 08:28.091
This is bullshit.

08:28.133 --> 08:30.427
Aw, Zelda made me a sandwich.

08:30.469 --> 08:31.887
That's sweet.

08:31.929 --> 08:33.222
Do you want to be successful?

08:33.263 --> 08:34.681
Of course I want
to be successful.

08:34.723 --> 08:36.558
Being successful means
that people come to see you,

08:36.600 --> 08:38.185
and when people come to see you,
you become--

08:38.227 --> 08:39.645
what they call in the biz--
famous.

08:39.686 --> 08:41.688
-Yeah. I know.
-Most people who go on stage

08:41.730 --> 08:43.106
want to be famous
'cause it means

08:43.148 --> 08:44.441
they get to play
better theaters.

08:44.483 --> 08:46.485
They get better gigs.
They go on TV.

08:46.526 --> 08:48.487
They go to Morocco
with Bob and Bing.

08:48.528 --> 08:50.489
And here's the best part:
they give you more money.

08:50.530 --> 08:52.783
Now, that's actually the part
that I find the most appealing.

08:52.824 --> 08:54.284
Money is my main goal.

08:54.326 --> 08:56.078
I don't have any,
and I'd like some.

08:56.119 --> 08:58.580
I want to be famous.
I want money.

08:58.622 --> 09:00.999
I want to go to Morocco
with Bob and Bing.

09:01.041 --> 09:02.751
And I am gonna tell my parents.

09:02.793 --> 09:04.795
They're just...
they're not here right now,

09:04.836 --> 09:06.838
and it's not news
I'd like to break long-distance.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.298
So when they come home.

09:08.340 --> 09:10.050
When they come home,
I come clean.

09:10.092 --> 09:12.344
-And when's that gonna be?
-I don't know.

09:12.386 --> 09:15.889
I swear. I have no idea
when my parents are coming back.

09:22.938 --> 09:24.898
You believe i-in fairy tales.

09:24.940 --> 09:27.317
I do not believe in fairy tales.
I'm a man of science.

09:27.359 --> 09:29.820
The Bible serves its purpose.

09:29.861 --> 09:32.990
It is basically
a moral set of rules.

09:33.031 --> 09:34.199
A-a road map.

09:34.241 --> 09:35.575
Men are not able

09:35.617 --> 09:38.620
to determine right or wrong
without a road map.

-Better. The Bible. (laughs)

09:47.796 --> 09:50.632
-Oh, dear. We'll meet for lunch?
-See you there.

09:50.674 --> 09:51.925
Au revoir, messieurs.

09:51.967 --> 09:53.385
-Au revoir.
-Au revoir.

09:53.427 --> 09:57.180
Abe, your wife is very,
very attractive.

09:57.222 --> 09:59.599
-Elle est très belle.
-You lucky man.

09:59.641 --> 10:01.226
The luckiest.

10:01.268 --> 10:03.020
So, where were we?

10:03.061 --> 10:04.855
Oh, yes, Sergei's an idiot.

11:37.948 --> 11:39.950
("Coin de rue"
by Juliette Gréco playing)

11:52.754 --> 11:56.258
We spent two hours
debating moral nihilism

11:56.299 --> 11:59.386
versus mereological
or compositional nihilism.

11:59.428 --> 12:01.638
At least, I think
that's what we were debating.

12:01.680 --> 12:03.140
I can't be sure.

12:03.181 --> 12:05.475
Either way, it's nihilism,
so who cares?

12:05.517 --> 12:07.686
Anyhow, whatever it was,

12:07.727 --> 12:09.688
it got Sergei all steamed up.

12:09.729 --> 12:11.523
He started arguing with Thierry.

12:11.565 --> 12:14.025
Or Rolf. I don't know. It was
someone to the left of me.

12:14.067 --> 12:16.611
And the next thing I know,
Thierry is crying,

12:16.653 --> 12:18.697
Rolf is singing Brecht,
and I'm decrying

12:18.738 --> 12:20.866
America's national cynicism.

12:20.907 --> 12:23.368
And no one would let
the other person pay the bill.

12:23.410 --> 12:26.288
It was just a terrific,
terrific day.

12:26.329 --> 12:28.248
-Proost.
-Proost.

12:28.290 --> 12:30.750
Today my class went
to the Rodin Museum.

12:30.792 --> 12:32.878
Rodin, aha.

12:32.919 --> 12:35.046
It's in this glorious building
that was his studio

12:35.088 --> 12:37.966
and sort of artists' flophouse
at the same time.

12:38.008 --> 12:39.968
It's a museum now.
I tell you, Abe,

12:40.010 --> 12:41.720
it took my breath away.

12:41.761 --> 12:45.307
The hands on his sculptures,
they're so powerful.

12:45.348 --> 12:47.392
-Massive.
-Hands are great.

12:47.434 --> 12:49.311
-What is this?
-What does it taste like?

12:49.352 --> 12:52.272
-Rodin loves big hands. Go on.
-I can't imagine

12:52.314 --> 12:54.065
how he did it,
how he would look at nothing,

12:54.107 --> 12:57.194
a block of marble,
and see what he saw.

12:57.235 --> 12:58.612
I'd love to show it to you.

12:58.653 --> 13:01.448
-Absolutely. Is it fish?
-Does it taste like fish?

13:01.490 --> 13:03.783
I can't wait
to see Rodin's hands.

13:03.825 --> 13:07.537

-I can't?

14:31.204 --> 14:32.831
You're right. Jankel's gone.

14:32.872 --> 14:35.000
You run a factory.
You need machines that work.

Firing may not be enough.

14:37.460 --> 14:40.171

Not even a full day.

-He leaves at 1:00.
-He should skip temple?

you should be smoking there.

15:09.743 --> 15:11.494

Lots of chemicals and solvents

That's the fourth cigarette
break he's taken this morning.

15:21.421 --> 15:23.798
So what? You're so hot
for people taking breaks.

15:23.840 --> 15:25.800
People who work.
I've never seen him work.

That's what Manny does.
Manny does.

Get up. Take a break.

15:34.184 --> 15:35.727
You're not chained to the table.

-Are you?
-She's not chained to the table.

15:37.771 --> 15:39.606
Go have some coffee.

15:40.690 --> 15:42.275
Oh, look at her go.

15:42.317 --> 15:44.027
-Jesse Owens.
-Pop.

15:44.069 --> 15:46.780
What? It'll take her an hour
to walk across the room

15:46.821 --> 15:48.281
and an hour to get back.

15:48.323 --> 15:49.866
That's half
of her remaining life span.

15:49.908 --> 15:52.202
-Moishe, she won't let me in.
-What?

15:52.243 --> 15:54.204
-Come. Come, come, come, come.
-Where we going?

15:54.245 --> 15:55.830
-Look, look, I'm locked out.
-What's happening?

15:55.872 --> 15:57.332
-Where's he going? Hey.
-Go, go. Get him, get him.

15:57.374 --> 15:58.583
-Hey, hey. Get back here.
-Come back here.

15:58.625 --> 16:01.336
-Do not close the...

16:01.378 --> 16:03.421
Let me guess,
it's worse than I thought.

16:03.463 --> 16:05.256
-Oh, much, much worse.
-Terrific.

16:05.298 --> 16:07.842
None of these numbers add up.
A-And this writing.

16:07.884 --> 16:09.427
At first,
I thought it was in Hebrew,

16:09.469 --> 16:11.763
but then I realized
parts are in Yiddish.

-And this is ancient Aramaic,

16:13.556 --> 16:15.600

for 2,000 years.

(stammers) Can you figure out
any of the money?

16:17.977 --> 16:20.772
-The figures?
-I think it's a numerical system

16:20.814 --> 16:22.774
-that has eliminated
the number six.

16:22.816 --> 16:24.401
-What?

16:24.442 --> 16:26.695

out of my own office?

16:26.736 --> 16:28.613
What is she doing with my book?

16:28.655 --> 16:30.573
You think I don't have a key
to my own office?

16:30.615 --> 16:32.742
-These books don't make sense.
-SHIRLEY: Of course they do.

16:32.784 --> 16:35.161
-What do you want to know?
-Well, everything would be nice.

16:35.203 --> 16:36.913
This column
is the money we have.

16:36.955 --> 16:38.832
This column is the money
we will have

16:38.873 --> 16:40.750
as soon as these people
from this column

16:40.792 --> 16:42.085
or that column pay us.

16:42.127 --> 16:43.670
Unless it has a bagel stamp,

16:43.712 --> 16:45.004
which means
it's still being negotiated

16:45.046 --> 16:47.590
but we started the work anyway
in case it works out.

16:47.632 --> 16:49.008
Three flags,
that means the check cleared.

16:49.050 --> 16:50.593
Two flowers,
that means a half and half.

16:50.635 --> 16:52.762
-A half and half?
-Half check, half cash.

16:52.804 --> 16:54.389
Or half cash, half services.

16:54.431 --> 16:56.975
Or half... something
and half something else.

16:57.016 --> 16:59.436
-You have Kaufman and Hart
write this bit?
-Uh, can I

16:59.477 --> 17:02.856
just ask you-- um, there is
a Sunny spelled with a "U"

17:02.897 --> 17:05.608
and a Sonny with an "O"
and another with an I-E.

17:05.650 --> 17:07.277
Is that the same Sonny?

17:07.318 --> 17:09.279
Of course it's the same Sonny.

17:09.320 --> 17:11.781
It's Sonny. Sonny from Queens.

17:11.823 --> 17:14.534
-Pop, you need an accountant.
-What are you talking about,
accountant?

17:14.576 --> 17:16.953
This is a foolproof system
that I invented myself.

17:16.995 --> 17:18.288
Completely secure.

17:18.329 --> 17:20.123
Only I can understand it.

17:20.165 --> 17:21.332
I don't know.

17:21.374 --> 17:23.293
I'll have you know
that we got audited once.

17:23.334 --> 17:24.961
And when the guy took one look
at this book,

17:25.003 --> 17:26.671
we never saw him again.

17:26.713 --> 17:28.840
I paid him off. That's why
we never saw him again.

17:28.882 --> 17:30.258
-Pop, this is crazy.
-Okay.

17:30.300 --> 17:32.594
Enough. You came, you saw.

17:32.635 --> 17:34.929
Thank you for letting me know
that everything I do is wrong

17:34.971 --> 17:36.890
and your mother's accounting
system is a piece of shit.

17:36.931 --> 17:38.141
It really is a piece of shit.

17:38.183 --> 17:39.976
I'm serious. You and you, out.

17:40.018 --> 17:42.228
Well, all right.
But before we leave,

17:42.270 --> 17:44.481
I found this book

17:44.522 --> 17:46.483
in a secret hiding place
in the wall.

17:46.524 --> 17:48.735
No! Put that back. You should
not be looking through that.

17:48.777 --> 17:50.737
This is the special loans book.

17:50.779 --> 17:52.739
-Special loans book?
-What?
-SHIRLEY: That's personal.

17:52.781 --> 17:54.616
Don't tell me you're borrowing
money from those guys.

17:54.657 --> 17:56.576
-Once in a while.
-I can't believe this.

17:56.618 --> 17:58.578
You see yourself--
the machines break down.

17:58.620 --> 18:00.497
Those machines are expensive.

18:00.538 --> 18:02.749
How else are we supposed
to get that kind of cash?

18:02.791 --> 18:04.834
-From a bank?
-What are you, a big shot?

18:04.876 --> 18:07.253
Banks don't break your legs
or throw you in a river.

18:07.295 --> 18:09.506
I'm seeing amounts here.
I'm seeing names.

18:09.547 --> 18:12.050
But I'm not seeing any dates
for when the loans are due.

18:12.091 --> 18:13.927
Oh, well, we know
when the loans are due.

18:13.968 --> 18:16.012
A couple of guys break in
in the middle of the night.

18:16.054 --> 18:18.014
They bust up some chairs
and windows.

18:18.056 --> 18:19.933
And that's when we know
the loan is due.

18:19.974 --> 18:21.976
-Shirley, stop helping me.
-What?

18:22.018 --> 18:23.978
-What did I do wrong?
-Nothing, Ma. Relax.

18:24.020 --> 18:27.941
Why don't you go get yourself
a cup of coffee.

18:27.982 --> 18:29.108
There's a machine out there now.

18:29.150 --> 18:30.193
There's a coffee machine?

18:30.235 --> 18:32.487
Oh, what a wonderful idea!

18:33.947 --> 18:35.490
Go home.

18:35.532 --> 18:37.450
You know what, Pop,
I'm not going home.

18:37.492 --> 18:38.868
I'm staying.

18:38.910 --> 18:40.328
I'm gonna go through
those cockamamie books,

18:40.370 --> 18:42.205
and I'm gonna get things
in shape around here.

18:42.247 --> 18:45.750
I'm gonna start by firing the
low-hanging fruit like Manny.

18:45.792 --> 18:48.086
-Manny's not a fruit.
He came to your bar mitzvah.
-He's gone.

18:48.127 --> 18:49.921
I'm firing him today.
Along with Pete,

18:49.963 --> 18:51.422
who's in the storage room
playing cards

18:51.464 --> 18:52.757
with two other guys
that I don't know.

18:52.799 --> 18:53.842
They're fired, too.

18:53.883 --> 18:56.094
Every single freeloader
around here, gone.

18:56.135 --> 18:57.762
I'm getting them
off the payroll.

18:57.804 --> 18:59.931
I'm gonna find a fucking
seven-day-a-week repairman.

18:59.973 --> 19:02.517
And once I know this place isn't
being run like a mental asylum,

19:02.559 --> 19:04.811
then I'll go home.

19:07.063 --> 19:10.650
SHIRLEY:
Oh, this coffee is delicious!

19:23.162 --> 19:25.498
She's got to work
on these notes.

19:25.540 --> 19:27.584
Here comes one, with
Andy Griffith bringing it in.

19:27.625 --> 19:29.085
-Andy Griffith!
-(cheers and applause)

19:29.127 --> 19:33.089
Howdy, Steve. Well...

19:33.131 --> 19:34.841
STEVE:
Who's next for you?

19:34.883 --> 19:37.886
ANDY: I've got one here, Steve,
from last July,

19:37.927 --> 19:41.306
where they sent up two mice
in a space rocket,

19:41.347 --> 19:42.974
and they-they lost them both.

19:43.016 --> 19:44.225
I heard about that.
It's too bad.

19:44.267 --> 19:45.602
How do they plan
to find them again?

19:45.643 --> 19:47.353
Well, they got it figured out,
Steve.

19:47.395 --> 19:48.813
They figure they're gonna
launch a cat.

19:48.855 --> 19:50.273
-A cat. Uh-huh.
-(laughs): Yeah.

19:50.315 --> 19:52.567
Thank you, Andy.
He'll be back in a little bit.

19:52.609 --> 19:54.986
And now, here come
the McGuire Sisters.

19:55.028 --> 19:56.446
(cheers and applause)

20:00.700 --> 20:03.077
Night, Susie.

20:03.119 --> 20:06.039
Night, Ethan.

20:06.080 --> 20:08.708
Look. Should we get it
for Sergei?

20:08.750 --> 20:10.877
Oh, God, no.

20:10.919 --> 20:13.796
-To the market?
-To the market.

20:13.838 --> 20:16.257

JOEL (over phone):
Hey, pal, it's Daddy.

22:57.085 --> 22:58.294
Hi, Daddy.

22:58.336 --> 23:00.713
Wow, you're answering
the phone now, huh, buddy?

23:00.755 --> 23:03.341
-Big man now.
-ETHAN: Yeah.

23:03.382 --> 23:04.884
Hey, put your mommy on, okay?

23:04.926 --> 23:06.385
Okay.

23:06.427 --> 23:08.387
Phone!

23:10.348 --> 23:11.933
Hello?

23:11.974 --> 23:13.768
Who the fuck is this?

23:13.810 --> 23:15.853
-Who the fuck is this?
-This is Joel.

23:15.895 --> 23:17.396
-Who?
-Midge's husband. Who are you?

23:17.438 --> 23:18.648
Susie.

23:18.689 --> 23:21.317
-Susie who?
-From the Gaslight.

23:21.359 --> 23:22.819
What the hell are you
doing there?

23:22.860 --> 23:24.862
I don't know.
Why the hell are you calling?

23:24.904 --> 23:26.948
-Midge is my wife.
-Not anymore.

23:26.989 --> 23:29.909
I asked Ethan to put his mother
on-- why'd he put you on?

23:29.951 --> 23:31.619
I don't know,
he's your idiot kid.

23:31.661 --> 23:33.246
You know what?

23:33.287 --> 23:35.206
-Is Midge there?
-No.

23:35.248 --> 23:36.624
Can you take a message?

23:36.666 --> 23:38.251
-No.
-Will you take a message?

23:38.292 --> 23:40.753
I need her to meet me.
It's important.

23:40.795 --> 23:42.880
-Hello?
-Fine.

23:42.922 --> 23:45.341
Tell Midge to meet me
at 15 West 40th.

23:45.383 --> 23:47.760
JOEL:
I-I like the molding,

23:47.802 --> 23:49.178
but I may want to
strip the paint off.

23:49.220 --> 23:51.264
-Is that possible?
-MAN: It's getting late.

23:51.305 --> 23:54.642
-Knock-knock.
-Midge, great. Come in.

23:54.684 --> 23:56.144
I'd like you to meet
Mr. Greenberg.

23:56.185 --> 23:57.645
Mr. Greenberg owns
the building.

23:57.687 --> 24:00.606
Oh, well, your parents must be
so very proud.

24:00.648 --> 24:03.568
Don't touch anything.
The paint's not dry.

24:03.609 --> 24:05.987
-Well, he's a charmer.
-He's fine.

24:06.028 --> 24:08.322
The most important thing is
he keeps a clean building.

24:08.364 --> 24:11.159
Anyhow, thank you for coming.

24:11.200 --> 24:13.286
-You said it was important.
-I know.

24:13.327 --> 24:15.705
I didn't mean to be dramatic,
but I-I've toured

24:15.746 --> 24:17.582
a lot of shitholes
over the past few weeks,

24:17.623 --> 24:19.500
so when I finally
found this place,

24:19.542 --> 24:22.086
I had to get you down here
before someone else took it.

24:22.128 --> 24:24.297
What are you talking about?
What is this?

24:24.338 --> 24:27.592
Your new apartment.
(chuckles)

24:27.633 --> 24:29.468
I really think it's
the perfect place for you.

24:29.510 --> 24:33.055
-For me?
-And Ethan and Esther.

24:33.097 --> 24:34.849
I know it's smaller
than you're used to,

24:34.891 --> 24:37.894
but it's very clean,
it's an elevator building.

24:37.935 --> 24:40.438
It's a great location, halfway
between the club downtown

24:40.479 --> 24:41.981
and your parents' apartment.

24:42.023 --> 24:43.357
There's a great park
a block away.

24:43.399 --> 24:44.609
The butcher's right
around the corner,

24:44.650 --> 24:45.902
and it's right off
three subways.

24:45.943 --> 24:48.696
I can manage it, and you won't
have to work anymore.

24:48.738 --> 24:51.240
Whoa, whoa, whoa, who says
I'm gonna stop working?

24:51.282 --> 24:53.743
-Well, you'll have to.
-Oh, I will?

24:53.784 --> 24:55.369
-Why will I have to?
-I...

24:55.411 --> 24:57.747
Am I suddenly unable
to apply lipstick?

24:57.788 --> 24:59.415
-No.
-I can't point to powder?

24:59.457 --> 25:01.292
-You can point.
-I can't spritz a person

25:01.334 --> 25:03.044
with perfume?
That's where my abilities end?

25:03.085 --> 25:04.462
You'll have the kids.
You won't have your parents

25:04.503 --> 25:05.504
or Zelda around.

25:05.546 --> 25:06.756
I figured you'd want to quit.

25:06.797 --> 25:08.007
Oh, you figured.
You figured?

25:08.049 --> 25:09.800
-What's the matter?
-I just don't like you

25:09.842 --> 25:11.135
telling me where I'm gonna live.

25:11.177 --> 25:12.220
I wasn't telling you.

25:12.261 --> 25:13.596
Where are you gonna live, huh?

25:13.638 --> 25:14.847
-Me?
-Yeah, you're still

25:14.889 --> 25:16.349
-at your parents', right?
-Yes.

25:16.390 --> 25:17.642
Well, if you can tell me
where I'm gonna live,

25:17.683 --> 25:18.851
-then I can tell you
where you're gonna live.
-Midge.

25:18.893 --> 25:20.353
Turtle Bay.
You're gonna live in Turtle Bay.

25:20.394 --> 25:22.480
-Where the hell is Turtle Bay?
-I don't know.

25:22.521 --> 25:23.940
It's right off three subways.
Have fun!

25:23.981 --> 25:25.566
-Why are you angry?
-I'm not angry.

25:25.608 --> 25:27.777
-It's a nice apartment.
-I had a nice apartment.

25:27.818 --> 25:29.695
-I know.
-And I lost it because of you.

25:29.737 --> 25:31.113
I know.

25:31.155 --> 25:32.949
And it was right off
three subways, too.

25:32.990 --> 25:34.367
It wasn't, actually.

25:34.408 --> 25:36.369
How can you suddenly
afford this?

25:36.410 --> 25:38.412
Huh? You quit your job.

25:38.454 --> 25:40.039
-Right?
-Uh...

25:40.081 --> 25:41.457
Imogene said that
you quit your job,

25:41.499 --> 25:42.792
and now Archie's gonna
get fired.

25:42.833 --> 25:44.001
Why is Archie gonna
get fired?

25:44.043 --> 25:45.336
I don't know. Ask Imogene.

25:45.378 --> 25:47.380
She said that you walked out
and left Archie standing

25:47.421 --> 25:48.881
next to the chart that she made.

25:48.923 --> 25:50.341
-Imogene made that chart?
-Yes.

25:50.383 --> 25:51.467
That was a great chart.

25:51.509 --> 25:52.551
So you get another job?

25:52.593 --> 25:54.887
-Midge, I've got it covered.
-How?

25:54.929 --> 25:56.055
Do you like the apartment
or not?

25:56.097 --> 25:59.475
-No.
-Fine.

25:59.517 --> 26:01.102
Yes, it's very nice.

26:01.143 --> 26:03.813
The phone niche is
particularly delightful.

26:03.854 --> 26:06.148
I'm sorry,
it's not the apartment.

26:06.190 --> 26:08.943
The apartment's fine.
It's just a lot...

26:08.985 --> 26:11.153
I can find my own place.

26:11.195 --> 26:13.072
Okay, find your own place.

26:13.114 --> 26:14.907
Just tell me what it costs
and I'll pay for it.

26:14.949 --> 26:16.701
With the job
you don't have yet?

26:16.742 --> 26:18.494
Midge, give me a break, please?

26:18.536 --> 26:21.163
I'm just trying to do
some fucking thing right here!

26:21.205 --> 26:25.960
I know. I know.

26:26.002 --> 26:28.546
Sorry to drag you out here
like this.

26:28.587 --> 26:30.506
It's a nice place, it's just...

26:30.548 --> 26:33.426
I get it.

26:39.557 --> 26:41.517
I don't want you to live
in Turtle Bay.

26:41.559 --> 26:44.020
I don't either.

26:44.061 --> 26:46.272
Okay.

26:46.314 --> 26:48.566
Well, that's settled.

26:50.985 --> 26:53.362
ABE: No, no, no, no, no,
I-I can do this.

26:53.404 --> 26:55.281
I am a learned man, I teach
at a major university.

26:55.323 --> 26:56.449
ROSE:
Fine.

26:56.490 --> 26:58.617
Ah! Thursday, right there.

26:58.659 --> 27:00.036
That says "Thursday."

27:00.077 --> 27:02.747
Bravo. Ethan would be
very proud of you.

27:02.788 --> 27:06.083
See, I hear some very French
sarcasm in that "bravo."

27:06.125 --> 27:08.044
Pas du tout!
That means "not at all."

27:08.085 --> 27:09.754
-(chuckles)
-Are you ready?

27:09.795 --> 27:11.047
For what?

27:11.088 --> 27:12.506
ROSE (singsongy):
Come on.

27:12.548 --> 27:14.175
Rose, where are you taking me?

27:14.216 --> 27:16.510
Rose, you're being
very mysterious.

27:16.552 --> 27:18.429
ROSE:
Am I? We're here.

27:18.471 --> 27:21.223
It's so exciting.

27:26.896 --> 27:28.731
Voilà!

27:28.773 --> 27:30.691
ABE:
What is this?

27:30.733 --> 27:33.736
Jeanne, from my class,
her parents own the building.

27:33.778 --> 27:35.321
The tenants just moved out,

27:35.363 --> 27:37.031
so they haven't had the chance
to fix it up yet,

27:37.073 --> 27:38.574
but I just had to
show it to you immediately.

27:38.616 --> 27:40.201
Obviously, it needs some paint

27:40.242 --> 27:42.203
and some repairs here and there,
but look at the view.

27:42.244 --> 27:43.579
ABE:
Ooh, that's some view.

27:43.621 --> 27:45.581
See over there?
That's your café.

27:45.623 --> 27:47.208
-So it is.
-Five blocks away.

27:47.249 --> 27:49.627
-Ah.
-There are two bedrooms
back here.

27:49.668 --> 27:51.670
A perfect little kitchen,
bathroom.

27:51.712 --> 27:53.172
-Look at that ceiling.
-Isn't it marvelous?

27:53.214 --> 27:55.049
I almost don't want them
to fix it up.

27:55.091 --> 27:57.426
It's sort of glorious
in its shabbiness.

27:57.468 --> 28:00.429
-(laughs)
-We-we could put a sofa there,

28:00.471 --> 28:02.223
some chairs,
right over here your piano.

28:02.264 --> 28:03.349
-Ooh, yes.
-(snaps fingers)

28:03.391 --> 28:04.642
The acoustics are perfect.

28:04.683 --> 28:06.185
The dining room would
go in here.

28:06.227 --> 28:09.230
We could fit eight comfortably,
ten with a leaf.

28:09.271 --> 28:12.441
And right over here would be
a great place for you to read.

28:12.483 --> 28:14.693
Oh, yes, perfect reading light.

28:14.735 --> 28:18.197
This wall is for bookshelves,
I think a console over here.

28:18.239 --> 28:19.865
A radio, record player...

28:19.907 --> 28:21.200
-Are they dog friendly?
-They're dog friendly.

28:21.242 --> 28:22.743
They have to be dog friendly.

28:22.785 --> 28:24.328
Plus, there's a little park
around the corner

28:24.370 --> 28:25.413
where we could throw
her little ball.

28:25.454 --> 28:26.497
She loves that little ball.

28:26.539 --> 28:28.124
It's special, isn't it?

28:28.165 --> 28:31.335
-Well, it is just a ball.
-No, the apartment.

28:31.377 --> 28:33.671
-Oh, yes, it's magnificent.
-I know.

28:33.712 --> 28:35.214
I mean, I love our little place,

28:35.256 --> 28:37.550
but it's not very practical
for the long term.

28:37.591 --> 28:40.678
Though I will miss the boys, but
we'll just have to get used to

28:40.719 --> 28:42.096
our own bathroom again.

28:42.138 --> 28:44.682
And hot water, we'll have to
get used to hot water again.

28:44.723 --> 28:49.270
-Rose.
-(Rose continues indistinctly)

28:49.311 --> 28:51.480
-Rose.
-Hmm?

28:53.649 --> 28:56.110
We can't buy this apartment.

28:56.152 --> 28:57.486
Why not?

28:57.528 --> 28:59.530
Because we don't live here.

28:59.572 --> 29:01.282
Well, we will
after we buy the place.

29:01.323 --> 29:03.409
In Paris,
we don't live in Paris.

29:03.451 --> 29:04.743
We have to go home.

29:04.785 --> 29:06.245
Paris is home.

29:06.287 --> 29:07.913
No, Rose, it's not.

29:07.955 --> 29:09.498
Why not?

29:09.540 --> 29:11.750
Because my classes at Columbia
start in a week.

29:11.792 --> 29:13.586
I'm a tenured professor.

29:13.627 --> 29:15.880
And if I don't go back,
I'll lose my spot at Bell Labs.

29:15.921 --> 29:18.466
And if I don't go back,
what will I lose?

29:18.507 --> 29:21.385
-Well...
-Drapes will have to be made,

29:21.427 --> 29:22.970
but the shutters will do
for now.

29:23.012 --> 29:25.598
Rose, stop.
Our lives are in New York.

29:25.639 --> 29:27.016
Your friends are in New York.

29:27.057 --> 29:28.601
Your-your garden club
is in New York.

29:28.642 --> 29:30.895
I have friends here, too.
So do you.

29:30.936 --> 29:33.022
-What friends?
-What are you talking about?

29:33.063 --> 29:35.733
Thierry, Rolf, Sergei.
Have you forgotten about them?

29:35.774 --> 29:37.610
Of course not.

29:37.651 --> 29:39.737
You're part of their group;
you're-you're one of them.

29:39.778 --> 29:43.657
I am not one of th-- I have no
idea what they're talking about.

29:43.699 --> 29:46.285
They could be sitting there
saying, "That idiot, Abe,

29:46.327 --> 29:48.704
"thinks we like him.
Let's set his coat on fire,

29:48.746 --> 29:50.748
and see how long it takes him
to notice."

29:50.789 --> 29:52.458
Well, not Thierry,
he cries too much,

29:52.500 --> 29:54.293
but Sergei,
he looks like a pyro.

29:54.335 --> 29:56.295
That's not true;
they're kindred spirits.

29:56.337 --> 29:58.631
They all drink 40 cups
of coffee a day

29:58.672 --> 30:00.466
and switch to absinthe at noon.

30:00.508 --> 30:02.885
They all have wives
and girlfriends.

30:02.927 --> 30:05.471
-So what?
-I don't want a girlfriend.

30:05.513 --> 30:07.848
I'm still getting used
to a maid.

30:07.890 --> 30:10.851
I am not French.
I'm different.

30:10.893 --> 30:12.978
You're adjusting.
Y-You're learning the language.

30:13.020 --> 30:14.897
"Thursday,"
I learned "Thursday."

30:14.939 --> 30:17.191
W-Wednesday can't be far behind.

30:17.233 --> 30:19.026
Rose.

30:19.068 --> 30:22.404
I want to go home.

30:22.446 --> 30:25.950
This has been
a wonderful vacation...

30:28.202 --> 30:30.913
...but it's time to go back
to our life.

30:30.955 --> 30:32.623
What life?

30:32.665 --> 30:34.583
My daughter does not want
my guidance.

30:34.625 --> 30:36.168
You have no need for my input.

30:36.210 --> 30:37.753
I'm alone in New York.

30:37.795 --> 30:40.172
Here, I have art.

30:40.214 --> 30:43.259
I have independence;
no one looks at me with pity.

30:43.300 --> 30:45.511
-No one looks at you...
-Poor Rose, she's too fragile

30:45.553 --> 30:48.264
to be told the truth,
too delicate to confide in.

30:48.305 --> 30:50.558
She'll shatter.

30:50.599 --> 30:54.728
Here in Paris, I'm...

30:54.770 --> 30:56.814
shatterproof.

30:56.855 --> 30:59.066
I'm-I'm sorry I lied to you.

30:59.108 --> 31:01.610
I'll never do it again.

31:01.652 --> 31:05.030
And I-I promise
we will figure out a way

31:05.072 --> 31:07.283
to make it better
once we get back.

31:07.324 --> 31:10.202
But we have to go back.

31:10.244 --> 31:12.496
Do you hear me?

31:12.538 --> 31:15.291
Rose.

31:15.332 --> 31:18.002
Rosie.

31:27.636 --> 31:29.597
(door slams)

31:32.099 --> 31:33.851
Wait.

31:33.892 --> 31:35.603
(sniffs) Smell that?

31:35.644 --> 31:37.062
Smells like cheap beer and piss.

31:37.104 --> 31:39.106
I know. Exciting, right?

31:39.148 --> 31:40.482
Hi. I'm working here tonight.

31:40.524 --> 31:42.026
-I'm a comic.
-Oh.

31:42.067 --> 31:43.319
What's up her ass?

31:43.360 --> 31:44.445
Tone down the perk.

31:44.486 --> 31:45.571
We're in a real club now.

31:45.613 --> 31:46.655
Sorry.

31:46.697 --> 31:47.990
Fuck you, keep walking.

31:48.032 --> 31:49.199
There you go.

31:49.241 --> 31:52.119
Aha. There he is.

31:52.161 --> 31:53.746
Bobby, hi.

31:53.787 --> 31:55.748
Susie Myerson of Susie Myerson
and Associates.

31:55.789 --> 31:57.833
I don't need that.
You're my girl comedian?

31:57.875 --> 31:59.209
-Yes, I am.
-All right.

31:59.251 --> 32:00.878
I have you down
for an eight-minute slot.

32:00.919 --> 32:02.212
Eight minutes. Eight minutes.
Eight minutes?

32:02.254 --> 32:03.672
-I'll talk fast.
-Eight minutes is great.

32:03.714 --> 32:04.673
Here's four drink tickets.

32:04.715 --> 32:06.300
You're up third.

32:06.342 --> 32:08.260
-Third. Good slot.
-Really?

32:08.302 --> 32:09.928
Are you kidding?
Third is perfect.

32:09.970 --> 32:11.930
The crowd is warmed up
but not worn out.

32:11.972 --> 32:13.432
Yeah? Okay. Third. Great.

32:13.474 --> 32:15.768
How do I look?
Hair? Makeup? Teeth?

32:15.809 --> 32:18.020
Excuse me.
Uh, Mrs. Maisel, is it?

32:18.062 --> 32:19.438
-Midge is fine.
-Oh.

32:19.480 --> 32:21.065
Midge is fine.
Isn't Midge fine?

32:21.106 --> 32:23.859
Bobby told us there was a lady
comic coming on tonight.

32:23.901 --> 32:25.527
Didn't tell us
she was quite so pretty.

32:25.569 --> 32:27.655
-Well, thank you.
-EUGENE: That is a lovely dress.

32:27.696 --> 32:29.531
Susie Myerson.
I'm her manager.

32:29.573 --> 32:31.450
EUGENE: So you're the girl
from the Gaslight gig, right?

32:31.492 --> 32:33.243
Lenny Bruce's girl.

32:33.285 --> 32:34.745
Oh, I'm not his girl,
just his friend.

32:34.787 --> 32:36.080
EUGENE:
So what kind of act do you do?

32:36.121 --> 32:38.749
Birds? Violin? Wait-- singer.

32:38.791 --> 32:40.084
-Nope.
-STAN: Oh, you should sing.

32:40.125 --> 32:41.335
EUGENE:
You'd clean up as a singer.

32:41.377 --> 32:42.753
But I-I don't sing.

32:42.795 --> 32:44.421
It doesn't matter,
just wear that dress.

32:44.463 --> 32:47.758
Hey, so one colleague to
another, uh, you and Lenny...?

32:47.800 --> 32:49.218
Me and Lenny what?

32:49.259 --> 32:51.053
Well, what he did for you,
that was pretty big.

32:51.095 --> 32:53.055
You must've done something
pretty big for him first, right?

32:53.097 --> 32:54.890
Nothing but respect if you did.

32:54.932 --> 32:56.934
Hey, I'd sleep with Lenny Bruce
if he asked.

32:56.975 --> 32:59.603
-The man is a god.
-She did not fucking sleep
with Lenny Bruce.

32:59.645 --> 33:00.979
-Yeah.
-And even if she did,

33:01.021 --> 33:02.481
that's not why he did the gig.

33:02.523 --> 33:04.024
I-I didn't sleep with him.

33:04.066 --> 33:05.442
I know, but my point is,

33:05.484 --> 33:07.111
even if you did,
it doesn't matter.

33:07.152 --> 33:08.946
-Yeah, but I didn't.
-I know, but if you did...?

33:08.987 --> 33:10.531
For fuck's sake.

33:10.572 --> 33:12.491
Wow, little lady's got
a potty mouth.

33:12.533 --> 33:15.828
-Lenny teach you that also?
-(both chuckle)

33:17.121 --> 33:19.248
-Well, I like them.
-Oh, relax.

33:19.289 --> 33:21.291
Odds are at least one of them
has late-stage syphilis.

33:21.333 --> 33:22.376
I'm getting a drink.

33:22.418 --> 33:23.460
-You want one?
-Nope.

33:23.502 --> 33:24.461
-You want to sit?
-Nope.

33:24.503 --> 33:25.879
I am going to stay fresh.

33:25.921 --> 33:27.423
Okay, well,
as long as you're okay

33:27.464 --> 33:28.966
with me sitting and drinking,
we're good.

33:29.007 --> 33:30.676
BOBBY: Hey, everybody,
I'm Bobby Stelter,

33:30.718 --> 33:32.344
your humble host
for the evening.

33:32.386 --> 33:34.972
Are you guys in the mood
for a fantastic show?

33:35.013 --> 33:36.974
-(applause)
-All right, then what
you want to do

33:37.015 --> 33:38.600
is walk outside
and catch a cab to the Copa

33:38.642 --> 33:39.893
'cause it ain't happening here.

33:39.935 --> 33:41.186
Now, let's bring up
our first comic.

33:41.228 --> 33:43.522
He's Canadian, but don't
hold that against him.

33:43.564 --> 33:45.441
Joey Parker!

33:48.444 --> 33:49.987
Thanks, Bobby.

33:50.028 --> 33:51.780
True story.

33:51.822 --> 33:55.659
Before John Wayne was famous,
he was a prop man on movie sets.

33:55.701 --> 33:58.662
But what if he never
became "The Duke"

33:58.704 --> 34:00.622
and was still working
behind the scenes?

34:00.664 --> 34:03.500
Could you see him having to be
James Mason's prop guy?

34:03.542 --> 34:05.043
(laughter)

34:05.085 --> 34:07.838
(imitating John Wayne):
Well, here ya go, pilgrim.

34:07.880 --> 34:09.465
(imitating James Mason):
A gun?

34:09.506 --> 34:12.426
-Why are you handing me a gun?
-(laughter)

34:12.468 --> 34:15.053
(imitating John Wayne):
It's a Colt Single Action.

34:15.095 --> 34:17.222
They'll know who's boss.

34:17.264 --> 34:19.475
-Mrs. Maisel.
-Yes, here.

34:19.516 --> 34:21.393
-Put your hand down.
-Slight change.

34:21.435 --> 34:23.228
You're gonna go on
fourth now, okay?

34:23.270 --> 34:24.605
Oh, sure. Fourth.

34:24.646 --> 34:26.231
-Fourth is, fourth is...
-Better.

34:26.273 --> 34:28.066
-Really?
-Much better. Fourth is perfect.

34:28.108 --> 34:29.735
I thought you said third
was perfect.

34:29.777 --> 34:31.278
Mm, fourth is more perfect.

34:31.320 --> 34:33.322
I didn't want to say it before
'cause you were going on third,

34:33.363 --> 34:35.073
but fourth is so much better.

34:35.115 --> 34:37.618
Yo, barkeep.

34:37.659 --> 34:39.661
-(applause)
-EUGENE: I used to be a lawyer

34:39.703 --> 34:41.163
and I was terrible at it.

34:41.205 --> 34:43.874
I would hear
the other lawyers' arguments

34:43.916 --> 34:45.459
and I'd start to look
at my client sideways like,

34:45.501 --> 34:47.753
-"Yeah, you do seem guilty."
-(laughter)

34:47.795 --> 34:50.631
-You sure you don't want to sit?
-Staying fresh.

34:50.672 --> 34:52.758
Okay, well, see, here's what's
good about going on fourth.

34:52.800 --> 34:54.343
I'm listening.

34:54.384 --> 34:56.345
Gives you time to look around,
take in the room.

34:56.386 --> 34:58.263
-What am I looking for?
-Material.

34:58.305 --> 35:01.642
-For example, you see that lady?
-Yeah. Ooh, that hat.

35:01.683 --> 35:04.228
Exactly. That hat is screaming
to be talked about.

35:04.269 --> 35:07.064
That hat is the fat girl in
a family full of beauty queens.

35:07.105 --> 35:08.482
I can do something with that.

35:08.524 --> 35:10.692
EUGENE:
Hey, doll, what's with the hat?

35:10.734 --> 35:13.237
Going to a Minnie Pearl
look-alike contest later?

35:13.278 --> 35:15.280
(imitating Minnie Pearl):
Howdy!

35:15.322 --> 35:17.950
Shit. Minnie Pearl. So easy.

35:17.991 --> 35:19.535
Work for it a little at least.

35:19.576 --> 35:21.245
Bobby, I have another spot
tonight uptown.

35:21.286 --> 35:22.704
At this rate,
I'll never get there.

35:22.746 --> 35:24.248
-Stan...
-You want me to miss the gig?

35:24.289 --> 35:25.666
I won't get paid
and my little girl's

35:25.707 --> 35:27.251
gonna have to go without braces.

35:27.292 --> 35:29.044
She's gonna go through life
looking like Tim Tam

35:29.086 --> 35:30.629
'cause you got an Italian watch.

35:30.671 --> 35:32.005
Okay, okay. You're up next.

35:32.047 --> 35:34.007
-You thinking what I'm thinking?
-Yup.

35:34.049 --> 35:36.093
-Mrs. Maisel,
listen, I'm sorr...
-Yeah, we heard.

35:36.134 --> 35:38.095
You've already bumped her.
Bump someone else.

35:38.136 --> 35:39.721
Stan's a regular. He's been
working here four years.

35:39.763 --> 35:41.431
He brings people in.

35:41.473 --> 35:44.685
You work here four years,
you bring people in, we'll talk.

35:44.726 --> 35:47.563
So, going fifth
is better 'cause...?

35:47.604 --> 35:49.940
The audience is drunker?
Lowers the bar.

35:49.982 --> 35:52.359
(applause)

35:55.571 --> 35:57.406
All right, let's keep
this cavalcade of comedy

35:57.447 --> 35:59.032
moving along, right?

35:59.074 --> 36:01.118
All right, next up,
a lot of you know his work.

36:01.159 --> 36:03.871
He's always funny,
always polite and discreet,

36:03.912 --> 36:07.332
our very own Stan Benning!

36:07.374 --> 36:10.502
-Stan!
-Thanks, Bobby. Mwah!

36:10.544 --> 36:13.005
Hey, look at you.

36:13.046 --> 36:14.923
Lots of beautiful women
in the audience.

36:14.965 --> 36:16.508
Too bad I'm married.

36:16.550 --> 36:20.512
My wife looks like
a work of art, a Picasso.

36:20.554 --> 36:22.723
You know, Disney has a new movie
about a princess

36:22.764 --> 36:24.516
called Sleeping Beauty

36:24.558 --> 36:28.770
and a new movie about my wife
called, "Not now, I'm sleeping."

36:28.812 --> 36:32.065
Oh, and hey, we got a girl comic
coming up in a little bit.

36:32.107 --> 36:33.775
That ought to be entertaining.

36:33.817 --> 36:36.278
Madge or Marjorie,
something like that.

36:36.320 --> 36:38.030
Don't get too excited, fellas.

36:38.071 --> 36:40.073
She keeps her clothes on.

36:40.115 --> 36:43.410
Plan to laugh at something
the guy next to you says

36:43.452 --> 36:45.162
'cause I ain't vouching
for Madge,

36:45.203 --> 36:47.623
though I hear
she's a hell of a singer.

36:47.664 --> 36:49.541
Fill her up!
You sure you don't...?

36:49.583 --> 36:51.543
Fresh, remember?

36:51.585 --> 36:55.047
I'd work up a hot rendition of
"Swanee" if I were you, Madge.

37:05.140 --> 37:07.517
(rattling nearby)

37:15.233 --> 37:17.653
(clattering nearby)

37:24.660 --> 37:27.287
-Aah! Shit.
-Pop.

37:27.329 --> 37:29.081
-Jesus.
-What the hell
are you doing here?

37:29.122 --> 37:31.959
-What does it look like?
-You have got to find a girl.

37:32.000 --> 37:35.337
-What time is it?
-11:30.

37:35.379 --> 37:37.506
I checked downstairs already.

37:37.547 --> 37:39.091
We're probably clear
for the night.

37:39.132 --> 37:41.051
They would've come by now.

37:41.093 --> 37:43.387
(sighs) Okay.

37:43.428 --> 37:45.973
-Pop.
-Yeah?

37:46.014 --> 37:48.392
You want to get a drink?

37:48.433 --> 37:51.353
You remember the last time
we sat like this,

37:51.395 --> 37:54.189
you and me, a couple of drinks,
a couple of bats?

37:54.231 --> 37:56.817
-Nope.
-Yeah, me, either.

37:56.858 --> 37:58.777
Well, you have a life to live.

37:58.819 --> 38:00.362
We have to talk
about the factory.

38:00.404 --> 38:02.239
-No, we don't.
-The place is a mess.

38:02.280 --> 38:04.449
-It's not a mess.
-Okay, it's not a mess.

38:04.491 --> 38:05.951
Well, it's a little bit
of a mess.

38:05.993 --> 38:09.246
-How? How did it get this bad?
-I don't know.

38:09.287 --> 38:12.249
A year ago you were doing fine.

38:12.290 --> 38:14.501
You know, when I started
this business,

38:14.543 --> 38:17.713
I knew it would do well.
I was a determined guy.

38:17.754 --> 38:20.424
I had a brain cell or two,
plus I didn't have a choice.

38:20.465 --> 38:22.092
Wasn't gonna sell pickles
off a pushcart

38:22.134 --> 38:23.510
like my father did.

38:23.552 --> 38:26.805
But then it took off like a shot

38:26.847 --> 38:29.307
and now I feel like I've been
running a fucking marathon

38:29.349 --> 38:31.059
for 20 years.

38:31.101 --> 38:32.853
Next thing I know, I got loans,

38:32.894 --> 38:35.272
padded payrolls
and your mother's books.

38:35.313 --> 38:37.941
The son of a bitch landlord is
threatening to triple the rent

38:37.983 --> 38:39.317
because he knows I can't move

38:39.359 --> 38:40.902
and you know what
the real problem is?

38:40.944 --> 38:44.114
-You should've found a Roth.
-Should've found a Roth.

38:44.156 --> 38:46.283
Wasn't enough just
to put it on the sign.

38:46.324 --> 38:48.076
Where are your guys, Pop?

38:48.118 --> 38:50.620
Where's Carl, Izzie, Benny?

38:50.662 --> 38:53.331
Benny's gone.
Left six months ago.

38:53.373 --> 38:54.750
Izzie's been dipping
in and out lately.

38:54.791 --> 38:57.544
I don't trust Izzie.
Carl's sick.

38:57.586 --> 38:59.546
He's technically still
on the payroll, but...

38:59.588 --> 39:03.341
Listen... I'm gonna stay.

39:03.383 --> 39:05.385
-Stay where?
-I'm gonna stay
with the company.

39:05.427 --> 39:07.929
-Wait, wait a minute.
-Help get things back on track.

39:07.971 --> 39:09.848
Not forever. Understand?

39:09.890 --> 39:12.893
-But longer than
I had intended to.
-No.

39:12.934 --> 39:15.270
We have to get this figured out.

39:15.312 --> 39:17.397
We need an accountant or
a shaman to fix those books

39:17.439 --> 39:19.399
and we have to take care
of the landlord.

39:19.441 --> 39:20.525
How are you gonna do that?

39:20.567 --> 39:23.195
-We're gonna buy the building.
-Ah!

39:23.236 --> 39:24.905
You got the crazy
from your mother.

39:24.946 --> 39:27.741
Padded cell for two.
Visiting day will be nice.

39:27.783 --> 39:29.659
-We'll take out a loan.
-Another loan.

39:29.701 --> 39:31.870
A real loan from a bank.

39:31.912 --> 39:33.622
I can help you, Pop.
You need me.

39:33.663 --> 39:36.374
And for all this
white knight bullshit,

39:36.416 --> 39:37.918
I expect you want to be paid?

39:37.959 --> 39:39.461
You bet your ass
I want to be paid.

39:39.503 --> 39:41.296
So you need me.

39:41.338 --> 39:44.216
Okay, yes.

39:44.257 --> 39:47.302
How do I know this all
isn't just a whim?

39:47.344 --> 39:51.139
How do I know you won't just
walk out when you're not happy?

39:51.181 --> 39:52.557
My name's Maisel, too, Pop.

39:52.599 --> 39:55.560
The Maisel name
is on that building

39:55.602 --> 39:57.229
and it's gonna stay
on that building.

39:57.270 --> 40:01.233
Listen, I want you
to talk to Uncle Moe.

40:01.274 --> 40:04.694
My friend Archie, I kind of
hung him out to dry when I quit.

40:04.736 --> 40:06.655
I want you to tell Uncle Moe
to take care of him.

40:06.696 --> 40:08.365
He can't be fired.

40:08.406 --> 40:10.617
Now you want me to tell my
brother how to run his business?

40:10.659 --> 40:14.246
Archie's a good man.
He deserves his spot there.

40:14.287 --> 40:17.207
Okay. I do that for you and
in return you hire Manny back.

40:17.249 --> 40:20.502
-What? No.
-If Manny goes,
his wife Gloria goes.

40:20.544 --> 40:23.797
Gloria is my best seamstress.
Without her, I'm sunk.

40:23.839 --> 40:25.382
And Pete...?

40:25.423 --> 40:27.008
The schmuck playing cards
in the storeroom?

40:27.050 --> 40:28.385
His wife Bernice does
all my best embroidery.

40:28.426 --> 40:30.720
He went, she went.

40:30.762 --> 40:32.222
I need her back, too.

40:32.264 --> 40:34.141
Okay, Manny and Pete
can come back to work,

40:34.182 --> 40:35.684
but they have to fucking work.

40:35.725 --> 40:38.520
-Yeah. Good luck with that.
-So what? We have a deal?

40:38.562 --> 40:40.313
I'm back until things
are straightened out,

40:40.355 --> 40:41.565
until you're whole.

40:41.606 --> 40:43.400
Yeah.

40:43.441 --> 40:46.236
Remember, it's not permanent.

40:46.278 --> 40:48.488
-I am not your Roth.
-I know that.

40:48.530 --> 40:50.824
You're a Maisel.

40:52.576 --> 40:54.536
(laughter)

40:54.578 --> 40:56.329
NOAH: Jews come
from all over the world.

40:56.371 --> 40:58.415
In my family alone,
my grandparents speak

40:58.456 --> 41:01.418
five different languages, which
means that I know how to say,

41:01.459 --> 41:04.880
"Why aren't you married?"
in five different languages.

41:04.921 --> 41:06.423
I got circumcised
when I was eight days old.

41:06.464 --> 41:08.508
SUSIE:
Only one ticket left. Fuck it.

41:08.550 --> 41:10.886
Hey, bar guy.

41:10.927 --> 41:12.888
Are you okay?

41:12.929 --> 41:15.390
SUSIE: I fell off the stool
like I'm Dylan Thomas.

41:15.432 --> 41:17.058
Okay, you're up.

41:17.100 --> 41:18.768
Great. How do I look?

41:18.810 --> 41:20.937
Hey. Get up. Manage shit.

41:20.979 --> 41:22.689
SUSIE:
Sorry. Okay.

41:22.731 --> 41:24.399
Remember to wait
for the laughs completely.

41:24.441 --> 41:26.693
-You were rushing last week.
-I know. I'll remember.

41:26.735 --> 41:28.737
-NOAH: ...money and a hand job.
-(laughter)

41:28.778 --> 41:31.615
-Okay. Tits up.
-Tits up.

41:31.656 --> 41:34.326
Well, that's it for me tonight.
You've been a great audience.

41:34.367 --> 41:36.328
(applause)

41:36.369 --> 41:38.330
Everybody,
you're not gonna believe it,

41:38.371 --> 41:40.040
but someone just walked
in the door

41:40.081 --> 41:42.125
and there's no way he's leaving
without doing his thing.

41:42.167 --> 41:44.961
Jackie Vernon, get up here, man.

41:46.963 --> 41:49.424
Jackie Vernon!

41:49.466 --> 41:53.470
-Let him hear it.
-(cheers and applause)

41:56.932 --> 42:00.101
Good evening, ladies
and gentlemen. Thank you.

42:00.143 --> 42:02.646
Tonight I'd like
to talk about rejections.

42:02.687 --> 42:06.483
My personal rejections
brought on a weight problem.

42:06.524 --> 42:08.860
Every time a girl
would refuse me a date,

42:08.902 --> 42:12.781
I'd eat a piece
of Bavarian cream pie.

42:12.822 --> 42:16.326
One day I ate 238 pieces
of Bavarian cream pie.

42:16.368 --> 42:18.495
-(laughter)
-So close, and then he shows up.

42:18.536 --> 42:21.248
But don't worry. He's gonna be
really easy to follow.

42:21.289 --> 42:23.500
He's just super warming
the place up for you.

42:23.541 --> 42:25.126
Like he's doing you a favor.

42:25.168 --> 42:26.586
Thought you had to be somewhere.

42:26.628 --> 42:28.630
And miss Jackie Vernon?
Not a chance.

42:28.672 --> 42:31.132
VERNON: My doctor told me to cut
out all sugar and use saccharin.

42:31.174 --> 42:34.511
I used so much saccharin,
I developed artificial diabetes.

42:34.552 --> 42:35.929
(laughter)

42:35.971 --> 42:37.681
Okay, that's it.
I'll have a martini.

42:37.722 --> 42:39.432
We're out of drink tickets.

42:39.474 --> 42:41.393
I-I need something to eat, too.

42:41.434 --> 42:42.852
Oh, hot dogs.
Two hot dogs.

42:42.894 --> 42:44.437
Pay him for the hot dogs.

42:44.479 --> 42:46.523
This is turning out
to be a very expensive gig.

42:46.564 --> 42:48.566
Well, at least you're not
wearing the same outfit.

42:48.608 --> 42:50.277
I should have seen this coming.

42:50.318 --> 42:52.070
This whole day has been weird.

42:52.112 --> 42:54.614
Joel decided
to find me an apartment.

42:54.656 --> 42:57.325
Good. It's time that loser did
something other than his hair.

42:57.367 --> 42:59.536
My own apartment.
I never lived on my own.

42:59.577 --> 43:01.746
I went from my parents,
to college,

43:01.788 --> 43:03.498
back to my parents, to Joel.

43:03.540 --> 43:05.667
I feel like I've been living
alone since I was nine.

43:05.709 --> 43:07.419
-(laughter)
-I'm a little scared.

43:07.460 --> 43:09.671
I mean, what happens
when the toilet clogs?

43:09.713 --> 43:12.173
You get a plunger
and plunge all the shit out.

43:12.215 --> 43:13.550
Ugh!

43:13.591 --> 43:15.260
You are gonna die on your own.

43:15.302 --> 43:17.512
They're gonna find you
on the floor half eaten

43:17.554 --> 43:19.931
by your feral children, still
clutching the fucking plunger.

43:19.973 --> 43:21.349
Hey, new subject.

43:21.391 --> 43:23.393
Got a telegram from my parents.

43:23.435 --> 43:24.978
Oh. They're coming home?

43:25.020 --> 43:26.521
They're coming home.

43:26.563 --> 43:28.398
We have to figure out
your living situation.

43:28.440 --> 43:30.317
Hey, you were the one
who was scared.

43:30.358 --> 43:32.402
I'm fine going back
to my apartment.

43:32.444 --> 43:34.404
-Uh-uh.
-(laughter and applause)

43:34.446 --> 43:36.489
If you are shy, timid and meek,

43:36.531 --> 43:38.533
you shouldn't be too worried
about it

43:38.575 --> 43:40.410
because the meek
will inherit the earth.

43:40.452 --> 43:42.495
They wouldn't have the nerve
to refuse it.

43:42.537 --> 43:44.331
-(laughter)
-Oh, come on.

43:44.372 --> 43:45.707
What's your problem?

43:45.749 --> 43:47.584
I have mustard on my dress.

43:47.625 --> 43:49.377
Oh, yeah, right on your tit.

43:49.419 --> 43:51.129
It's not working.

43:51.171 --> 43:52.797
Of course not.
That's tequila.

43:52.839 --> 43:54.549
-Try gin.
-Look at me.

43:54.591 --> 43:57.177
Look at my dress.
It's all wrinkled and stained.

43:57.218 --> 43:59.137
I told you
I shouldn't sit down.

43:59.179 --> 44:01.639
-I didn't tell you to sit down.
-You motioned.

44:01.681 --> 44:04.351
I'm drunk. I was probably
grabbing the air for balance.

44:04.392 --> 44:06.478
How am I going
to go up there like this?

44:06.519 --> 44:08.355
Oh, don't worry.
This guy's never getting off.

44:08.396 --> 44:10.607
I'm wrinkled, I'm stained.

44:10.648 --> 44:12.859
-Plus...
-Plus what?

44:12.901 --> 44:16.237
Well...
you're a little pungent.

44:16.279 --> 44:17.906
I am not pungent.

44:17.947 --> 44:19.991
I am downwind.
I kind of know.

44:20.033 --> 44:21.701
Never. Never.

44:21.743 --> 44:23.578
I have never
in my life been...

44:23.620 --> 44:25.163
(sniffing)
What is that?

44:25.205 --> 44:27.040
-That's you.
-It's...

44:27.082 --> 44:31.044
-No, that's...
-(laughs)

44:31.086 --> 44:32.587
Well, what do you expect?

44:32.629 --> 44:34.631
I sweat a little
before I go on,

44:34.672 --> 44:36.716
which has happened four times
so far tonight.

44:36.758 --> 44:39.969
Well, folks, I don't want you
to get excited or panicky,

44:40.011 --> 44:42.013
but I just finished.

44:42.055 --> 44:43.681
How about a hand for the suit?

44:43.723 --> 44:45.725
Hey, he's done.
Get ready.

44:45.767 --> 44:48.269
-(cheering and applause)
-Shit, shit, shit, shit.

44:49.729 --> 44:53.191
The master,
ladies and gentlemen.

44:53.233 --> 44:56.778
(cheering and applause)

44:56.820 --> 44:58.571
Who could possibly
follow him, huh?

44:58.613 --> 45:00.156
Well, you're about to find out.

45:00.198 --> 45:01.908
They're leaving.

45:01.950 --> 45:03.868
-They smelled me.
-Just get up there.

45:03.910 --> 45:06.037
Hey, where you going?
Sit down. Sit back down.

45:06.079 --> 45:08.498
Hey, the best is yet to come.
The show is not over.

45:08.540 --> 45:10.250
-Sit your ass back down!
-BOBBY: Ladies and gentlemen,

45:10.291 --> 45:12.627
welcome an adorable lady who,

45:12.669 --> 45:15.922
if she can't make you laugh,
can at least make you dinner.

45:15.964 --> 45:18.007
Mrs. My-zell.

45:18.049 --> 45:19.801
Maisel, asshole. Maisel!

45:19.843 --> 45:22.220
-Tits up.
-Arms down.

45:28.226 --> 45:30.478
-Hey, where's the light?
-The light guy left.

45:30.520 --> 45:32.981
What the fuck?
She needs a spot.

45:33.022 --> 45:34.691
Uh, good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

45:34.732 --> 45:37.694
I'm Mrs. Maisel.

45:37.735 --> 45:39.112
Follow my voice!

45:39.154 --> 45:40.530
(scattered laughter)

45:40.572 --> 45:42.532
Uh, it's-it's so nice
to be here.

45:42.574 --> 45:44.117
It's nice of you to stay.

45:44.159 --> 45:48.413
I was supposed
to go on earlier, a lot earlier,

45:48.455 --> 45:50.457
-before I looked like this.
-MAN: Yeah.

45:50.498 --> 45:53.710
-Anyone have a comb?
-(woman laughs)

45:53.751 --> 45:55.462
Women would get that

45:55.503 --> 45:58.548
because there's-there's no way
a comb could fix this.

45:58.590 --> 46:00.383
-(soft laughter)
-A bomb would help.

46:00.425 --> 46:02.635
Group blindness would
work wonders.

46:02.677 --> 46:05.138
Anyhow, it wasn't
that great a joke.

46:05.180 --> 46:06.723
Or even a joke.

46:06.764 --> 46:08.808
Uh, an amusing observation,
perhaps.

46:08.850 --> 46:10.727
A wry comment, if you will.

46:10.768 --> 46:14.689
I'm sorry.
I feel so unfocused right now.

46:14.731 --> 46:16.733
I was really
in the pocket earlier,

46:16.774 --> 46:19.152
ready, fresh.

46:19.194 --> 46:21.321
Then I had a drink, and...

46:21.362 --> 46:23.698
(sighs)
This is mustard.

46:23.740 --> 46:25.825
-(scattered laughter)
-Here.

46:25.867 --> 46:31.414
As big a mess as my dress
is now, my life is worse.

46:31.456 --> 46:33.166
It's changing so fast.

46:33.208 --> 46:35.335
I was married,
I'm not married.

46:35.376 --> 46:37.420
I'm going to have to live alone
with my two children.

46:37.462 --> 46:39.088
It's all going to be up to me

46:39.130 --> 46:42.759
to take care of them,
of myself, of the toilet.

46:42.800 --> 46:45.303
So many goals I had
as a young woman.

46:45.345 --> 46:47.347
-Plunging was never one of 'em.
-(laughter)

46:47.388 --> 46:50.517
I don't want my own apartment.

46:50.558 --> 46:52.435
(cheering)

46:52.477 --> 46:56.022
Thanks, pal.

46:56.064 --> 46:59.192
I don't want my own apartment.

46:59.234 --> 47:03.863
I-I don't feel ready, mentally,
to have my own keys,

47:03.905 --> 47:06.991
my own plumbing,
my own angry Ukrainian super.

47:07.033 --> 47:09.786
-(laughter)
-I don't feel prepared

47:09.827 --> 47:12.664
to take on that kind
of responsibility alone.

47:12.705 --> 47:17.335
The only thing I feel prepared
to take on, right now,

47:17.377 --> 47:19.879
at this very minute,

47:19.921 --> 47:22.257
is those fucking losers
at the bar.

47:22.298 --> 47:24.968
-(laughter)
-I mean, look at them.

47:25.009 --> 47:28.179
The "before" picture
in a Charles Atlas

47:28.221 --> 47:30.807
male virility enhancement ad,

47:30.848 --> 47:34.227
just standing there,
waiting for me to bomb.

47:34.269 --> 47:36.104
It's midnight on a Tuesday

47:36.145 --> 47:37.689
and the highlight
of their evening

47:37.730 --> 47:40.358
is the possibility
of seeing a chick fail.

47:40.400 --> 47:41.776
(laughter)

47:41.818 --> 47:44.696
Am I supposed to find them
intimidating?

47:44.737 --> 47:47.073
'Cause-'cause all I see
is a lineup of men

47:47.115 --> 47:49.742
who had to go into comedy
just to get laid.

47:49.784 --> 47:51.744
-(laughter)
-Seriously.

47:51.786 --> 47:54.706
We know that if, say,
Eugene over there,

47:54.747 --> 47:58.376
came up to you at a bar
in his big-boy suit,

47:58.418 --> 48:00.587
with his tiny baby hands,

48:00.628 --> 48:02.589
and no opening line
pre-written for him,

48:02.630 --> 48:04.007
he'd be sent crawling home alone

48:04.048 --> 48:07.135
-to whack off in his onesie.
-(laughter)

48:07.176 --> 48:08.803
And Stan...

48:08.845 --> 48:12.098
-AUDIENCE: Ooh!
-...who has a voice
that bored a thousand ships

48:12.140 --> 48:13.600
into sinking themselves.

48:13.641 --> 48:15.727
If he couldn't say
to some unwitting female,

48:15.768 --> 48:18.521
"I got a gig downtown
in an hour," he'd have to say,

48:18.563 --> 48:20.481
"My mother should be
asleep by now."

48:20.523 --> 48:24.152
-(laughter)
-All comics are comics

48:24.193 --> 48:26.112
'cause something in their lives
went horribly wrong.

48:26.154 --> 48:27.822
Something went to shit.

48:27.864 --> 48:30.408
Either their hairline, Eugene.

48:30.450 --> 48:34.037
Or their personal lives. Me.
And Stan.

48:34.078 --> 48:36.831
I-I don't even need to know the
details, but looking at Stan,

48:36.873 --> 48:38.291
you just want to apologize

48:38.333 --> 48:40.710
and tell him everything's
gonna be okay,

48:40.752 --> 48:43.421
which it won't...
'cause it's Stan.

48:43.463 --> 48:47.216
-(laughter)
-But men, those over there,
and men in general,

48:47.258 --> 48:50.053
think that they are the
only ones who get to use comedy

48:50.094 --> 48:52.847
to close up those holes
in their soul.

48:52.889 --> 48:55.308
They run around telling everyone
that women aren't funny,

48:55.350 --> 48:57.935
-only men are funny.
-(scattered laughter)

48:57.977 --> 49:01.022
SUSIE: Sorry. Give me a minute.
God, this thing is heavy.

49:01.064 --> 49:04.359
-Okay, go ahead.
-Now, think about this.

49:04.400 --> 49:09.155
Comedy is fueled by oppression,

49:09.197 --> 49:12.867
by the lack of power,

49:12.909 --> 49:16.245
by sadness and disappointment,

49:16.287 --> 49:18.581
by abandonment

49:18.623 --> 49:21.417
and humiliation.

49:21.459 --> 49:24.462
Now, who the hell does that
describe more than women?

49:24.504 --> 49:26.422
Judging by those standards,

49:26.464 --> 49:29.550
only women should be funny.
And Stan.

49:29.592 --> 49:31.594
(laughter and cheering)

49:34.806 --> 49:37.100
Speaking of things that
women and Stan have in common,

49:37.141 --> 49:38.476
have you heard this term

49:38.518 --> 49:41.354
-"child bearing hips"?
-(laughter)

49:41.396 --> 49:42.980
You've been a great audience,
everyone.

49:43.022 --> 49:46.859
I'm Mrs. Maisel.
Thank you. Good night.

49:46.901 --> 49:48.986
On the way out,
everyone give the boys a hug.

49:49.028 --> 49:52.615
Or better yet,
some fresh material.

49:52.657 --> 49:55.076
-(cheers and applause)
-Thank you.

49:57.870 --> 49:59.831
-Thank you.
-Shit, lady!

49:59.872 --> 50:01.541
-You should stink more often.
-(laughs)

50:01.582 --> 50:03.042
BOBBY:
What the hell was that?

50:03.084 --> 50:05.545
Those are two of my best comics
you shit all over tonight.

50:05.586 --> 50:06.963
Well, they started it.

50:07.004 --> 50:08.840
How am I supposed
to get them back here

50:08.881 --> 50:10.925
after I let some snot-nosed
chick-comic take them down

50:10.967 --> 50:12.593
in front of a room
full of people?

50:12.635 --> 50:14.887
-It wasn't really full.
-A lot of them had left already.

50:14.929 --> 50:17.056
Doesn't matter!
You don't come into my club

50:17.098 --> 50:18.933
and talk like that
to my best earners.

50:18.975 --> 50:20.393
People come in
to see those guys.

50:20.435 --> 50:21.853
Nobody comes in to see you

50:21.894 --> 50:23.855
'cause nobody knows
who the fuck you are!

50:23.896 --> 50:25.898
Now here, take your money
and get out of here

50:25.940 --> 50:28.276
before I decide never
to book you in this place again.

will be coming

52:50.960 --> 52:52.503
He heard about
our trip to France

52:52.545 --> 52:54.130
and wants to have
something French.

52:54.171 --> 52:56.007
-What can you make
that's French?
-Nothing.

52:56.048 --> 52:58.301
What can you make that
we can say is French, isn't,

52:58.342 --> 52:59.719
-but he'll never know?
-Goulash.

52:59.760 --> 53:01.971
Perfect.

53:02.013 --> 53:03.931
ETHAN:
I'm done.

53:03.973 --> 53:05.892
He ate his breakfast.
How did that happen?

53:05.933 --> 53:07.435
I put chocolate chips
in his eggs.

53:07.476 --> 53:09.520
You're a genius. It's nice

53:09.562 --> 53:11.856
Miriam, will you be home
for dinner?

53:11.898 --> 53:13.316
We're having authentic
French goulash.

53:13.357 --> 53:14.692
I'm pulling
a double shift today.

53:14.734 --> 53:17.320
Well, we haven't seen
much of you since we got back.

53:17.361 --> 53:19.322
Never heard what you were up to
while we were gone.

53:19.363 --> 53:23.034
I have five to eight minutes.
Want to give me the highlights?

53:23.075 --> 53:26.954
Well, I just...

53:26.996 --> 53:29.582
hung out. I hung out.

53:29.624 --> 53:33.085
Okay. Good talk.
I'll be home at 6:00.

53:35.171 --> 53:36.631
See you later, Mama.

53:38.633 --> 53:41.469
-So, you'll meet me at 10:00?
-Meet you where?

53:41.510 --> 53:43.471
-My office.
-At Columbia?

53:43.512 --> 53:46.557
Of course. We had this
discussion, don't you remember?

53:46.599 --> 53:48.184
I have absolutely
no memory of this.

53:48.225 --> 53:51.312
They don't let women
audit the art history classes

53:51.354 --> 53:52.730
unless they're grad students.

53:52.772 --> 53:54.649
However, I talked to
the head of the department,

53:54.690 --> 53:56.317
and he said he would
make an exception

53:56.359 --> 53:58.319
but wanted to know what classes.

53:58.361 --> 54:00.237
What classes what?

54:00.279 --> 54:01.364
What classes you
wanted to audit.

54:01.405 --> 54:02.740
For God's sake, keep up, woman.

54:02.782 --> 54:06.452
-Are you serious?
-I told him we'd
come by at 10:15.

54:06.494 --> 54:08.329
His office is
right next to mine,

54:08.371 --> 54:11.040
but I was taking into account
your slow pace in those heels.

54:11.082 --> 54:13.250
So, yes?

54:13.292 --> 54:14.418
-Yes.
-Good.

54:14.460 --> 54:17.922
See you then.

54:17.964 --> 54:21.258
Oh, and I signed us up for
dance classes, Arthur Murray.

54:21.300 --> 54:23.761
We can't be caught out again
like that night on the Seine.

54:23.803 --> 54:26.806
I mean, we were adorable,
but our technique was terrible.

54:30.226 --> 54:34.063
Zelda, we're gonna serve
coq au vin tonight. I'll help.

54:34.105 --> 54:37.066
What? What did you say?
Did you say you'll help?

54:37.108 --> 54:39.068
