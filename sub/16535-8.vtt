WEBVTT

00:01.137 --> 00:03.204
'Cause Diego's got a cross-country meet,

00:03.205 --> 00:05.240
and the nanny's got a
class and can't take him.

00:05.242 --> 00:07.307
How do you not know this?

00:07.309 --> 00:11.079
No, Eva's in sat prep.

00:11.080 --> 00:13.615
Laura, Laura, Laura.

00:13.617 --> 00:15.250
Fine.

00:15.252 --> 00:17.117
I'll call Gabby, see if she can cover.

00:17.120 --> 00:18.753
Yeah.

00:23.960 --> 00:27.128
Wrong number.

00:27.129 --> 00:31.265
Things aren't going so
great with your ex?

00:31.268 --> 00:34.768
She's seeing some guy. He's older, rich.

00:34.771 --> 00:36.737
They travel a lot.

00:36.740 --> 00:40.674
She's basically checked out, mom-wise.

00:40.676 --> 00:42.109
Sorry, man.

00:42.112 --> 00:43.811
Homicide... Senour and Archer.

00:43.814 --> 00:45.979
ASA Stone wants us there.

00:50.387 --> 00:53.420
- Thank you.
- Tariq Bolad...

00:53.423 --> 00:55.289
Two gunshot wounds, center mass,

00:55.292 --> 00:57.491
wallet and keys still
on him but no cell phone.

00:57.493 --> 00:58.659
Who called it in?

00:58.661 --> 01:00.762
Shot spotter picked up possible gunfire.

01:00.764 --> 01:02.162
Dispatch put it over the zone.

01:02.164 --> 01:03.698
We were first on the scene.

01:08.572 --> 01:10.070
Is ASA Stone around?

01:15.177 --> 01:17.945
The Ariel Kincaid
murder. You remember it?

01:17.948 --> 01:19.114
Yeah, I do.

01:19.115 --> 01:20.448
It was two years ago.

01:20.450 --> 01:22.450
She was raped, tortured.

01:22.451 --> 01:24.753
They dumped her body in
the locks by Navy pier.

01:24.754 --> 01:26.721
Some rich kid did it.

01:26.722 --> 01:28.590
- Oliver Tuxhorn.
- Yeah.

01:28.591 --> 01:30.390
That little prick...
He's a person of interest

01:30.393 --> 01:31.492
in another rape, right?

01:31.495 --> 01:33.929
Four.

01:34.230 --> 01:35.729
So what about him?

01:35.731 --> 01:37.799
I started opening arguments
against Tuxhorn this morning.

01:37.801 --> 01:39.634
Tariq was my only eyewitness,

01:39.635 --> 01:40.868
but we're not screwed

01:40.871 --> 01:43.237
if you can link him to Tariq's murder.

01:43.240 --> 01:44.906
Tariq's grand jury testimony will stand.

01:44.908 --> 01:47.307
It's called "forfeiture by wrongdoing."

01:47.310 --> 01:49.176
Tuxhorn can't benefit from the shooting

01:49.179 --> 01:50.912
if we can prove he
was responsible for it.

01:50.914 --> 01:52.479
We'll make the link.

01:52.481 --> 01:53.847
Please do.

01:53.849 --> 01:56.350
If you don't, a serial
rapist and murderer walks.

01:58.000 --> 02:04.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:18.608 --> 02:20.175
Tariq had been here ten years...

02:20.176 --> 02:23.611
Originally from Sudan,
married, kid on the way.

02:23.614 --> 02:27.115
Employed as a supervisor in
an office-cleaning company.

02:27.117 --> 02:29.752
He was working on his
degree nights at UIC.

02:29.753 --> 02:31.552
Wasn't he in protective
custody for the trial?

02:31.555 --> 02:34.122
He was. Head of the detail
is on his way in now.

02:34.125 --> 02:35.924
You know, the original case file

02:35.925 --> 02:40.496
indicates that Tuxhorn and Ariel
left the Tiki on rush at 10:45.

02:40.497 --> 02:42.531
Now, Tuxhorn says that
they went to his apartment,

02:42.533 --> 02:44.699
they had consensual B&D sex,

02:44.701 --> 02:46.435
and then she walked out on her own.

02:46.437 --> 02:48.670
Tariq's statement says
that he saw Tuxhorn

02:48.673 --> 02:50.973
dragging Ariel's body towards
the locks where he dumped her

02:50.974 --> 02:52.373
and he drove off.

02:52.376 --> 02:54.242
He called 911, he went in after her,

02:54.245 --> 02:55.411
she was already dead.

02:55.413 --> 02:56.812
And the M.E.'s toxicology report

02:56.813 --> 02:58.614
determined she was
loaded up with ketamine.

02:58.615 --> 03:00.316
Four other girls have
made rape allegations

03:00.318 --> 03:01.650
against Tuxhorn.

03:01.651 --> 03:04.586
He skated on each case,
combo of his daddy's money

03:04.587 --> 03:07.256
and his high-powered
attorney, Dominick Cooke.

03:07.258 --> 03:08.289
He's the worst.

03:08.292 --> 03:09.692
Tariq's phone records?

03:09.693 --> 03:11.693
I'm into it with the service provider.

03:11.695 --> 03:14.096
Subpoena's been drafted,
signed off on, and dropped.

03:14.098 --> 03:15.597
So we should have it in a few hours.

03:15.598 --> 03:18.734
Yeah, well, we got one really
big question to answer first.

03:18.735 --> 03:21.569
Tariq Bolad's identity
was supposed to be sealed.

03:21.572 --> 03:23.271
Check into the grand jury,

03:23.274 --> 03:25.007
court reporters, ASA's office,

03:25.009 --> 03:27.742
whoever had access to his
name or a motive to leak it,

03:27.745 --> 03:29.177
'cause somebody figured it out.

03:29.180 --> 03:31.013
Ken Amis, the head of
Tariq's security detail,

03:31.014 --> 03:32.381
is on his way up.

03:32.383 --> 03:34.550
Al, you and me.

03:34.551 --> 03:37.186
You never met a more humble,

03:37.187 --> 03:39.655
more genuine guy in
your life than Tariq.

03:39.656 --> 03:41.122
He'd say how much this country gave him,

03:41.125 --> 03:42.890
and he wanted to give back...

03:42.893 --> 03:44.926
Stuff people don't say anymore.

03:44.929 --> 03:46.461
How long you been assigned to him?

03:46.463 --> 03:49.465
Two weeks. Me, Danny
Hearst, and Todd Peterson.

03:49.466 --> 03:50.733
Who else knew you were guarding him?

03:50.735 --> 03:54.302
Just ASA Stone and his
second chair, Valdez.

03:54.305 --> 03:58.973
So what happened last night?

03:58.975 --> 04:02.443
We had him at the best western O'Hare.

04:02.445 --> 04:05.347
He's his normal self. We're
watching "House Hunters."

04:05.348 --> 04:07.682
He goes in his room, and
he's in there for a while,

04:07.685 --> 04:09.685
and I walk by, and he's
sitting on the edge of his bed

04:09.687 --> 04:12.153
with his cell phone in
his hand, dead quiet.

04:12.156 --> 04:14.256
I ask if he's okay, and he says it was

04:14.258 --> 04:16.992
just the stress of the
trial starting the next day.

04:16.994 --> 04:18.961
And he went to the gym.

04:18.963 --> 04:20.428
Um...

04:20.430 --> 04:23.197
More than a half hour
goes by, 40 minutes.

04:23.199 --> 04:25.000
I call Danny, who's on
the gym's front door,

04:25.002 --> 04:27.168
but Tariq must've slipped out
the back door by the bathroom.

04:28.805 --> 04:31.673
Tariq got a call or
a text from somebody,

04:31.675 --> 04:33.007
and it was something that bothered him.

04:33.009 --> 04:35.076
That was my gut.

04:35.079 --> 04:37.146
That helps. Thanks.

04:37.148 --> 04:39.281
Yeah, we're gonna need the
information on the other two

04:39.283 --> 04:41.850
who were watching Tariq.

04:41.851 --> 04:44.286
So you can look into us?

04:44.288 --> 04:45.687
You know how it works.

04:45.689 --> 04:47.855
This is wasted time.

04:47.858 --> 04:49.591
Me and my team didn't do anything wrong.

04:49.593 --> 04:51.526
Except lose your guy.

04:57.300 --> 05:01.437
Hey. Um, Tariq Bolad's wife...
Widow... is, um, downstairs.

05:01.439 --> 05:03.372
I'll go.

05:05.509 --> 05:08.877
Hey.

05:08.879 --> 05:11.547
So how's the new partner?

05:11.548 --> 05:13.815
- He's a knucklehead.
- Ouch.

05:13.817 --> 05:15.550
All right.

05:19.557 --> 05:22.524
- Hey, Burgess.
- Yeah?

05:22.526 --> 05:23.559
One day...

05:23.560 --> 05:24.660
Yeah.

05:24.661 --> 05:26.762
Right.

05:31.569 --> 05:35.103
Mrs. Bolad?

05:35.105 --> 05:37.605
I'm... I'm Detective Erin Lindsay.

05:40.677 --> 05:42.677
I'm so sorry.

05:46.182 --> 05:48.449
You, um...

05:48.451 --> 05:50.319
You have no idea what Tariq went through

05:50.321 --> 05:52.387
to get to this country...

05:52.389 --> 05:56.057
What he witnessed, what he endured.

05:56.060 --> 05:59.961
And after all that, to be killed here...

06:10.274 --> 06:14.108
Were you in communication
with Tariq last night at all?

06:15.913 --> 06:18.646
Just a couple texts,
saying that I loved him

06:18.649 --> 06:20.949
and I was proud of him.

06:20.951 --> 06:25.786
Did he seemed worried
or agitated lately?

06:25.788 --> 06:27.689
No.

06:27.690 --> 06:29.725
I mean, I was.

06:29.726 --> 06:32.461
Why?

06:32.463 --> 06:34.596
We were being followed...

06:34.598 --> 06:36.899
Starting about a month ago.

06:36.901 --> 06:39.500
It would be a different car each time.

06:39.502 --> 06:44.005
Did you mention this to the
State's Attorney's office?

06:44.007 --> 06:45.473
I did...

06:45.475 --> 06:49.677
To Mr. Stone's investigators.

06:49.680 --> 06:53.749
They looked into it, but
didn't find anything credible.

06:55.185 --> 06:57.151
But they put police officers
in front of our house.

06:57.153 --> 07:00.622
And that's when Tariq
went into full protection

07:00.624 --> 07:04.293
and I went to stay with my parents.

07:04.295 --> 07:08.129
It's the Tuxhorn kid who
paid to have Tariq killed.

07:08.132 --> 07:09.298
I mean...

07:09.300 --> 07:10.932
Or his dad.

07:10.935 --> 07:13.401
Who else could it be?

07:13.403 --> 07:15.437
We will find out.

07:23.613 --> 07:25.880
Any objection to the State's motion

07:25.882 --> 07:27.949
for continuance, Mr. Cooke?

07:27.951 --> 07:30.117
Not if the court will reconsider bail.

07:30.120 --> 07:33.689
Bail? The Tuxhorn family
has unlimited resources,

07:33.691 --> 07:35.691
not to mention hotels
all over the world.

07:35.692 --> 07:36.959
If Mr. Tuxhorn is released...

07:36.961 --> 07:38.593
The prosecution just admitted

07:38.596 --> 07:40.495
their case is a featherweight
without a witness.

07:40.497 --> 07:42.163
I understand you're going
to give them a continuance,

07:42.165 --> 07:44.499
your honor, but my client
shouldn't have to wait it out

07:44.500 --> 07:46.435
in jail if the state
can't make its case.

07:46.437 --> 07:48.569
The State can't make its
case because the defendant

07:48.572 --> 07:50.271
may have arranged to have
a witness to be killed.

07:50.274 --> 07:51.973
If Mr. Stone had proof of that,

07:51.975 --> 07:53.808
we'd be in a separate
courtroom with new charges.

07:53.810 --> 07:55.343
If he'd prefer to discuss dismissal...

07:55.346 --> 07:56.511
No shot.

07:56.512 --> 07:59.413
Mr. Tuxhorn will surrender his passport.

07:59.415 --> 08:01.682
Bail is set at $2 million...

08:01.685 --> 08:05.420
And State's motion for
continuance is granted.

08:06.757 --> 08:08.589
Other motions? Nope.

08:08.591 --> 08:10.492
We love you, Oliver!

08:10.494 --> 08:13.127
Okay.

08:29.480 --> 08:31.112
Wait here. Yeah.

08:32.349 --> 08:34.816
That's an easy way to make
600 bucks, give or take.

08:34.817 --> 08:37.418
You have an interest
in this case, Detective?

08:37.421 --> 08:38.854
I want to talk to your client.

08:38.855 --> 08:41.856
I want to play first base for the cubs.

08:41.859 --> 08:44.158
He doesn't want to clear his name?

08:44.160 --> 08:45.326
I'll be in contact.

08:45.328 --> 08:47.328
Now, will you excuse
us, or do I need to call

08:47.331 --> 08:49.530
one of those fine Cook
County Sheriffs over?

08:52.101 --> 08:56.203
I saw you in court. Thank
you for your support.

08:56.206 --> 08:58.740
Enjoy your freedom, douche bag.

08:58.741 --> 09:01.576
You're not gonna have it for long.

09:01.577 --> 09:03.879
Oliver, let's go.

09:13.316 --> 09:15.717
Checked into Tuxhorn's
visitor list from lockup.

09:15.720 --> 09:17.219
Mail, phone, and visitor logs

09:17.221 --> 09:18.888
show only his attorney and his family

09:18.889 --> 09:20.121
having any contact with him.

09:20.124 --> 09:22.191
I want you to add
Tuxhorn's family members

09:22.192 --> 09:23.725
to the list we gave financial crimes.

09:23.727 --> 09:26.327
I want a complete workup
of all their financials,

09:26.330 --> 09:28.129
specifically any large-sum withdrawal

09:28.131 --> 09:30.032
in the last two months or so.

09:30.033 --> 09:32.701
Hey, Stone asked he be kept in
the loop as much as possible.

09:32.702 --> 09:34.302
I don't think I've ever disliked someone

09:34.304 --> 09:36.804
so quickly or so intensely.

09:36.807 --> 09:38.274
So tell me, heading
down to the courthouse,

09:38.275 --> 09:39.575
what did that accomplish?

09:39.576 --> 09:41.744
I got to look in his eyes.

09:41.745 --> 09:43.077
Isn't that what you always say...

09:43.080 --> 09:44.580
"I look in people's eyes for a living"?

09:44.581 --> 09:46.615
Fair enough. What'd you see?

09:46.616 --> 09:49.485
He is responsible for
Tariq's murder, no question.

09:49.486 --> 09:50.818
Okay.

09:50.821 --> 09:54.123
Just make sure you don't let
this guy get in your head.

09:54.125 --> 09:55.423
Hey, Sarge?

09:55.426 --> 09:56.991
Tariq's cell phone dump came back in.

09:56.994 --> 09:59.827
He got a call an hour before his murder.

09:59.830 --> 10:01.429
Conversation lasted a minute and a half.

10:01.432 --> 10:03.264
From a guy named Amir Dafallah.

10:03.267 --> 10:04.899
Tariq's widow said
that Amir came over here

10:04.902 --> 10:06.235
with Tariq from Sudan.

10:06.236 --> 10:08.102
They were best friends,
but Amir never really

10:08.105 --> 10:09.705
got his act together, always
looking to borrow money.

10:09.706 --> 10:10.905
Amir have priors?

10:10.908 --> 10:12.841
Drunk and disorderly
and resisting arrest.

10:12.842 --> 10:14.243
Hit it.

10:29.527 --> 10:31.860
- Yes?
- Amir Dafallah?

10:33.697 --> 10:37.700
CPD. This is a search warrant.

10:37.701 --> 10:40.001
- What... what is going on?
- Why don't you step aside?

10:40.004 --> 10:41.102
- Excuse me.
- Turn around, please.

10:41.105 --> 10:43.004
- What...
- Arms up.

10:46.076 --> 10:48.243
All right.

10:48.245 --> 10:50.278
Take a seat.

10:50.280 --> 10:52.615
You know a Tariq Bolad?

10:52.616 --> 10:54.383
What has happened to Tariq?

10:54.384 --> 10:55.918
- So you know him.
- Yes.

10:55.919 --> 10:57.186
Did something happen to him?

10:57.187 --> 11:00.188
Yeah, he was injured
last night in a shooting.

11:00.191 --> 11:01.889
My god.

11:01.892 --> 11:04.592
You know anything about it, Amir?

11:04.595 --> 11:06.361
No, no. I...

11:06.364 --> 11:07.763
I would never hurt Tariq.

11:07.764 --> 11:10.566
He's my closest friend.

11:10.567 --> 11:14.003
Well, you got a funny way of showing it.

11:14.004 --> 11:16.404
It's a .38...

11:16.407 --> 11:18.407
Same caliber as the
slugs pulled out of Tariq.

11:18.408 --> 11:20.475
That... that is not my gun.

11:20.477 --> 11:21.777
Stay seated.

11:21.778 --> 11:24.480
Any reason why the serial
numbers are shaved off?

11:24.481 --> 11:26.081
All right, put your
hands on the counter.

11:26.082 --> 11:27.548
I swear to you, that is not my gun.

11:27.551 --> 11:29.451
Amir, I'm not gonna ask you again.

11:29.452 --> 11:31.620
Put your hands on the counter.

11:40.831 --> 11:42.630
Hey.

11:42.633 --> 11:44.099
Hey.

11:44.100 --> 11:47.269
So Tariq's murder might not
have been about the Tuxhorns.

11:47.270 --> 11:49.171
It might have been
motivated by a personal beef.

11:49.173 --> 11:50.371
You got to be kidding me.

11:50.374 --> 11:52.408
Yeah, a buddy of his who
came over here from Sudan.

11:52.409 --> 11:53.841
So Oliver Tuxhorn walks.

11:53.844 --> 11:55.677
Well, give us some time to confirm it.

11:55.679 --> 11:57.178
I'll let you know as
soon as we find out.

11:57.181 --> 11:59.514
Yeah. Hey, Antonio.

11:59.517 --> 12:01.182
You...

12:01.184 --> 12:03.652
You happy in Intelligence?

12:03.653 --> 12:07.089
I'm making a change in
the Investigator's Office.

12:07.091 --> 12:09.024
It would be spearheading
major investigations,

12:09.025 --> 12:11.326
not just Chicago... Statewide.

12:11.327 --> 12:14.028
- Are you... you're offering me...
- Yeah.

12:14.030 --> 12:15.730
Commander's pay, but more...

12:15.732 --> 12:18.067
Weekends and holidays
off, regular hours.

12:18.068 --> 12:21.102
- See your wife more often.
- I'm divorced.

12:21.105 --> 12:24.206
Your kids, then.

12:24.207 --> 12:27.142
I'm flattered. Seriously.

12:27.144 --> 12:28.876
But I'm in the best unit in Chicago.

12:28.879 --> 12:30.111
What if told you sergeant Voight

12:30.114 --> 12:31.647
already signed off on you coming over?

12:33.783 --> 12:35.884
Window's gonna close fast. Let me know.

12:46.629 --> 12:47.962
Ready?

12:47.965 --> 12:50.466
Ready?

12:50.467 --> 12:52.701
Yeah.

13:01.479 --> 13:03.644
What happened last night, Amir?

13:06.783 --> 13:08.917
I...

13:08.918 --> 13:11.886
Lost my job as a dishwasher...

13:11.889 --> 13:15.289
<i>Because they found out I...</i>

13:15.292 --> 13:18.192
<i>I lied about having a criminal record.</i>

13:18.195 --> 13:22.898
When I got home, I got a call from INS,

13:22.899 --> 13:26.802
saying that I was at risk of
being deported back to Sudan.

13:26.803 --> 13:28.937
So I called Tariq,

13:28.938 --> 13:33.475
told him that I was
thinking crazy thoughts.

13:33.476 --> 13:37.111
You were gonna kill yourself.

13:37.114 --> 13:40.783
I admit, yes, I was feeling that way.

13:40.784 --> 13:44.952
Tariq came to meet me by the water.

13:44.955 --> 13:47.288
He made me feel better,

13:47.290 --> 13:50.859
told me I could stay with him and Lila.

13:52.596 --> 13:54.196
And then he left, and...

13:54.197 --> 13:57.566
I took the bus to my apartment.

13:57.567 --> 13:58.834
Were you gonna kill yourself

13:58.836 --> 14:00.402
with the gun that we found
stashed in your couch?

14:00.403 --> 14:02.738
- No, that is not my gun!
- Then whose is it?

14:02.740 --> 14:04.405
I-I do not know!

14:04.408 --> 14:07.676
<i>Do you understand how crazy
that might seem to us?</i>

14:07.677 --> 14:09.912
I-I do understand, but it is the truth.

14:09.913 --> 14:12.080
So you're happy for Tariq, his success?

14:12.081 --> 14:13.315
Yes.

14:13.317 --> 14:16.418
'Cause, man, he got here,
he landed on his feet.

14:16.419 --> 14:18.921
And you...

14:18.923 --> 14:21.355
Well, you struggled. Is
that a fair assessment?

14:21.357 --> 14:23.091
Yes, but...

14:23.092 --> 14:26.161
I have never given up hope...

14:27.998 --> 14:29.865
Until last night.

14:29.866 --> 14:34.503
You called Tariq. You
gave him that sob story.

14:34.504 --> 14:36.437
He went to see you.

14:36.440 --> 14:37.905
You asked him for a lot of money.

14:37.908 --> 14:41.442
When he turned you down, you
used that gun to shoot him.

14:41.445 --> 14:43.378
- No!
- Okay, so somebody else

14:43.379 --> 14:46.181
paid you a lot of
money to draw Tariq out!

14:46.182 --> 14:48.015
Draw him from where? No!

14:48.018 --> 14:49.350
You know the gun is at the crime lab,

14:49.352 --> 14:50.952
being tested for your
prints right now, Amir.

14:50.955 --> 14:52.620
And they will not find any.

14:52.623 --> 14:54.423
All right.

14:54.424 --> 14:56.959
You admit to calling him.

14:56.961 --> 14:59.193
You admit to being in an
agitated state last night.

14:59.196 --> 15:02.764
We find the same caliber
gun in your house.

15:02.765 --> 15:03.764
Quit jerking us off!

15:03.767 --> 15:06.902
Tell us the damn truth, man! Come on!

15:08.371 --> 15:12.640
After what Tariq and
I survived together...

15:14.879 --> 15:16.644
We were like brothers.

15:19.250 --> 15:21.950
I would never hurt him.

15:32.629 --> 15:36.230
I don't mind the body cameras.

15:36.232 --> 15:39.100
That's an unexpectedly
enlightened attitude for you.

15:44.107 --> 15:45.573
- Whoa, did you see that?
- Yeah.

16:04.461 --> 16:07.095
License, proof of
insurance, and registration.

16:07.096 --> 16:09.764
Here.

16:09.767 --> 16:11.365
Any reason why you jumped the curb, sir?

16:11.368 --> 16:14.836
Dropped my cell
phone. I was reaching for it.

16:14.837 --> 16:16.605
I'm sorry.

16:16.606 --> 16:20.107
Okay, um, you mind stepping
out of the car, sir?

16:20.110 --> 16:21.442
- Why?
- Because we need to

16:21.445 --> 16:24.745
do a field sobriety test.

16:24.748 --> 16:27.182
C-could we do it around the corner?

16:27.183 --> 16:28.951
- Get out of the car, pal.
- Come on.

16:36.427 --> 16:37.558
Wow.

16:42.066 --> 16:44.466
Business up top, party down below?

16:47.104 --> 16:48.470
Have you been drinking?

16:48.471 --> 16:50.072
No.

16:51.408 --> 16:53.408
What's under your skirt, there?

16:53.409 --> 16:55.076
A chastity belt.

16:55.078 --> 16:58.379
- I can't hear you.
- It's a chastity belt!

16:58.381 --> 17:00.581
- Burgess, help me out.
- What?

17:00.583 --> 17:03.684
- Chastity belt.
- Seriously?

17:03.687 --> 17:08.222
It's a device to, you
know, secure your privates.

17:08.223 --> 17:11.192
Good Lord.

17:11.194 --> 17:14.028
You did this voluntarily...
Just lock up your genitals?

17:14.030 --> 17:17.732
You weren't forced to do it?

17:17.733 --> 17:21.903
Voluntarily forced on me, I guess.

17:21.904 --> 17:23.538
All right, we'll leave it at that.

17:23.539 --> 17:26.575
Well, you have an extraditable
warrant out of Milwaukee

17:26.576 --> 17:27.709
for unpaid tickets,

17:27.711 --> 17:29.243
so we're gonna have to deal with this

17:29.246 --> 17:31.078
down at the district.

17:34.785 --> 17:36.250
Ballistics came back.

17:36.252 --> 17:38.686
The gun found at Amir's is a 100% match.

17:38.689 --> 17:40.788
- That gun shot Tariq.
- But...

17:40.790 --> 17:43.357
But Amir said that he got on
the bus after meeting Tariq.

17:43.359 --> 17:45.093
So we checked the bus
pass that he swiped.

17:45.095 --> 17:48.029
He got on the westbound
grand Avenue at 10:25 P.M.

17:48.031 --> 17:51.400
Shot spotter had shots
fired at 10:34 P.M.

17:51.402 --> 17:52.933
Amir had already been

17:52.935 --> 17:55.037
on this bus for 9 minute,

17:55.038 --> 17:57.204
and he was 15 blocks away.

17:57.207 --> 18:00.842
Amir couldn't have shot
Tariq. He was set up.

18:04.355 --> 18:07.390
Okay, follow me on this.

18:07.392 --> 18:09.491
Tariq's wife says they
were being followed.

18:09.493 --> 18:11.094
Let's assume they were.

18:11.096 --> 18:14.163
Let's assume somebody in Tuxhorn's camp

18:14.165 --> 18:15.432
found out Tariq's name.

18:15.433 --> 18:18.034
Once they knew that, they
knew everything about him,

18:18.036 --> 18:21.136
including his best friend, Amir.

18:21.138 --> 18:24.340
First day of the trial,
Amir gets fired from his job,

18:24.343 --> 18:26.041
and he gets a threatening call from INS.

18:26.044 --> 18:28.877
That sends him in a tailspin.
He calls Tariq for help.

18:28.880 --> 18:30.547
Now, that's either one
hell of a coincidence,

18:30.548 --> 18:32.982
or someone set Amir up.

18:32.984 --> 18:34.651
I called the restaurant
where he worked at.

18:34.653 --> 18:36.419
They said they got an "anonymous tip"

18:36.421 --> 18:37.988
that Amir had a record.

18:37.990 --> 18:40.923
Then I checked his phone
for that call from INS.

18:40.925 --> 18:44.728
Didn't come from INS. Came
from a pay phone downtown.

18:44.730 --> 18:46.496
I know that's a lot of dominoes to fall,

18:46.498 --> 18:47.931
but never underestimate what someone

18:47.932 --> 18:49.432
with 100 million in
the bank can pull off.

18:49.433 --> 18:51.867
We got some information on
Tuxhorn's older brother, Leo.

18:51.869 --> 18:53.603
Five major priors for possession.

18:53.605 --> 18:54.804
My guy in Narcotics told me

18:54.806 --> 18:56.506
that he's been an
addict since prep school.

18:56.508 --> 18:58.642
Yeah, and the data just came
back from financial crimes.

18:58.644 --> 19:00.542
Leo just finished a
two-month rehab stint...

19:00.545 --> 19:02.345
Serenity Wellness Retreat,

19:02.346 --> 19:03.779
Prescott, Arizona. Lindsay.

19:03.781 --> 19:05.815
- Got out two weeks ago.
- Put a tail on Leo.

19:05.817 --> 19:07.384
- Got it.
- Matter of fact, put a tail

19:07.385 --> 19:09.085
on every member of Tuxhorn's family.

19:09.086 --> 19:11.688
- Be right there.
- Hey, that's Cooke's office.

19:11.690 --> 19:14.557
Oliver Tuxhorn just
became available to talk.

19:14.558 --> 19:16.292
She leaps across the conference table...

19:16.295 --> 19:18.827
I'll tackle her.

19:18.829 --> 19:21.597
Gently.

19:21.599 --> 19:23.432
I'd like to remind you and your attorney

19:23.434 --> 19:27.470
of statute 5/5-2 of the criminal code.

19:27.471 --> 19:31.141
Anyone who encourages,
solicits, or helps...

19:31.143 --> 19:32.474
Not to mention pays...

19:32.477 --> 19:36.512
Someone to commit murder
is as guilty of that murder

19:36.515 --> 19:40.150
by Illinois State law
as the shooter himself.

19:40.152 --> 19:41.718
Great.

19:44.323 --> 19:46.423
Do you have any knowledge
of who may have killed

19:46.424 --> 19:48.692
a witness in your trial?

19:48.693 --> 19:50.826
- No.
- Anyone with motive,

19:50.828 --> 19:53.496
say, your family,
ever communicate to you

19:53.498 --> 19:56.031
that they knew the
identity of the witness?

19:56.034 --> 19:58.500
No.

19:58.502 --> 20:01.070
Did anyone in prison ever
offer to harm the witness

20:01.073 --> 20:02.505
for you for money?

20:02.507 --> 20:05.674
No..

20:05.676 --> 20:07.576
I heard this guy was African?

20:07.578 --> 20:09.244
Oliver...

20:10.749 --> 20:12.315
And how do you know that?

20:12.317 --> 20:13.415
From my time in prison.

20:13.417 --> 20:15.951
I met a lot of colorful
characters, you know?

20:15.953 --> 20:18.355
Huge gossips, so...

20:18.356 --> 20:20.056
So what if he was?

20:20.057 --> 20:21.958
A lot of anti-immigrant
sentiment out there.

20:21.960 --> 20:23.625
Could be a nice lead for you to pursue.

20:23.627 --> 20:26.695
Okay, Oliver, we are
here to answer questions,

20:26.698 --> 20:27.864
not pose theories.

20:27.865 --> 20:29.298
No, I spent two years

20:29.300 --> 20:30.767
in that repulsive jail for having sex

20:30.769 --> 20:32.035
with a chick somebody else murdered.

20:32.037 --> 20:33.435
Why are we being polite?

20:33.438 --> 20:36.905
They are here because my
family comes from money

20:36.907 --> 20:39.209
and it pisses them
off to no end, period.

20:40.711 --> 20:44.012
- Oliver, um...
- I'll give you some advice.

20:44.015 --> 20:47.282
Your case against me is
dead. You need to move on.

20:51.722 --> 20:53.222
Anything else?

20:53.224 --> 20:56.125
I got a couple things I could add.

20:59.798 --> 21:02.332
But I really don't
feel like losing my job

21:02.334 --> 21:03.665
over a little turd like you.

21:10.741 --> 21:13.242
Well, a key was delivered.
Chastity belt unlocked.

21:13.244 --> 21:15.310
And all is well in whoville.

21:15.313 --> 21:16.813
Close the door.

21:16.815 --> 21:20.817
<i>Business up
top, party down below?</i>

21:20.818 --> 21:21.984
What are you doing?

21:21.987 --> 21:25.020
Taking a little keepsake.

21:26.290 --> 21:28.590
<i>What do you have under
your skirt there?</i>

21:28.593 --> 21:30.626
<i>A chastity belt.</i>

21:30.628 --> 21:32.862
<i>- I can't hear you.
- It's a chastity belt!</i>

21:32.864 --> 21:35.397
Mike, you should not be doing this.

21:35.400 --> 21:37.400
Come on, what are you,
a hall monitor now?

21:37.402 --> 21:38.867
<i>Chastity belt.</i>

21:38.869 --> 21:41.237
<i>It's a device to,</i>

21:41.239 --> 21:43.873
<i>you know, secure your privates.</i>

21:43.875 --> 21:46.041
<i>Good Lord.</i>

21:46.044 --> 21:48.076
Relax.

21:52.616 --> 21:54.983
Tariq's security detail?

21:54.986 --> 21:57.019
No financial irregularities
on any of them.

21:57.021 --> 21:59.221
- Grand jury? ASA's office?
- Same.

21:59.223 --> 22:00.690
No big deposits or purchases.

22:00.692 --> 22:02.925
The Tuxhorns?

22:02.928 --> 22:04.727
That's a different deal entirely.

22:04.729 --> 22:06.496
The Tuxhorn hotel group is a private,

22:06.498 --> 22:08.964
family owned
multimillion-dollar corporation

22:08.967 --> 22:11.233
with no legal public
reporting requirements.

22:11.236 --> 22:13.202
How long to get into their books?

22:13.204 --> 22:15.438
- Three or four days.
- Well, you got ten hours.

22:15.440 --> 22:17.840
And it's got to trace back
to Oliver Tuxhorn himself.

22:17.843 --> 22:19.142
Check this out.

22:19.144 --> 22:21.277
Tuxhorn's lawyers got
payments in to a P.I....

22:21.278 --> 22:22.345
Jim Radovick.

22:22.346 --> 22:24.180
- I know that name.
- Yeah, ex-cop.

22:24.182 --> 22:26.682
He "retired" after allegations

22:26.684 --> 22:29.051
of excessive force and accepting bribes.

22:29.054 --> 22:31.054
- I'll pay him a visit.
- Good.

22:45.871 --> 22:48.605
You trying to push me
out of Intelligence?

22:48.606 --> 22:52.375
ASA Stone told me you
signed off on his job offer.

22:52.376 --> 22:53.710
I can't help but think

22:53.711 --> 22:55.478
it's because you and I have
locked horns once or twice

22:55.480 --> 22:57.980
since I got into this unit.

22:57.982 --> 23:00.250
Well, this unit finally came together

23:00.251 --> 23:03.019
when I took you on, Antonio.

23:03.020 --> 23:06.122
And for that, I'll always be indebted.

23:06.124 --> 23:08.156
And for the record...

23:08.159 --> 23:09.992
I didn't sign off on you going there.

23:09.994 --> 23:11.693
I recommended you.

23:13.198 --> 23:14.998
Why?

23:15.000 --> 23:18.334
You know, I had one good boss coming up.

23:18.336 --> 23:21.069
He said, "never hold
back a rising star."

23:23.307 --> 23:25.508
It's your time, Antonio...

23:25.509 --> 23:27.644
To run your own crew.

23:39.958 --> 23:41.190
I don't believe it.

23:41.192 --> 23:43.259
What's up, Jim?

23:45.230 --> 23:47.262
So you still on the job,
or you looking for one?

23:47.265 --> 23:50.266
Well, still on the job.

23:50.268 --> 23:52.000
- Hey, man.
- Of all the coppers,

23:52.002 --> 23:54.436
I thought, you know,
would've washed out somehow,

23:54.439 --> 23:56.605
and here you are still chugging away.

23:56.607 --> 23:58.641
And me? I'm the one to
get tossed out on his ass.

23:58.643 --> 23:59.942
Come on.

23:59.944 --> 24:03.378
Sometimes I surprise myself.

24:03.381 --> 24:05.315
Not too bad?

24:05.317 --> 24:06.382
I'm not a millionaire,

24:06.384 --> 24:07.784
but at least I don't have to deal

24:07.786 --> 24:11.386
with bosses, politicians,
and civilian review boards.

24:11.388 --> 24:14.757
Yeah, there's... There's always that.

24:14.759 --> 24:17.393
So what brings you?

24:17.394 --> 24:20.462
So you work for Dominick Cooke.

24:20.464 --> 24:22.397
As much as he'll let me.

24:22.400 --> 24:24.866
You work with him on
the Oliver Tuxhorn case?

24:24.868 --> 24:27.604
You seem to know I am.

24:27.605 --> 24:29.105
Doing what?

24:29.106 --> 24:30.707
Usual stuff...

24:30.709 --> 24:33.041
Background checks, poking
holes in the state's case.

24:33.044 --> 24:35.444
You looking into the
eyewitness against Tuxhorn?

24:39.683 --> 24:41.817
Why are you here, Al?

24:43.654 --> 24:47.022
Well, that witness was killed yesterday.

24:53.030 --> 24:54.963
Okay.

24:57.134 --> 24:59.836
You know anything about that?

25:01.172 --> 25:05.040
Look, um...

25:05.042 --> 25:08.111
This family, the Tuxhorns...

25:08.113 --> 25:12.214
They got what I call
a-a plantation mentality.

25:12.217 --> 25:15.718
Everybody is a servant.

25:15.720 --> 25:18.020
Me? As long as the checks clear,

25:18.022 --> 25:21.324
I can deal with any kind of
huge personalities, but...

25:24.028 --> 25:26.496
They wanted to know
who that witness was.

25:26.498 --> 25:27.663
Who's they?

25:31.336 --> 25:34.671
The dad and the brother, Leo.

25:34.673 --> 25:37.507
- The junkie?
- Yeah.

25:37.509 --> 25:39.275
He's on the outs with the family...

25:39.277 --> 25:40.509
Black sheep-type deal.

25:40.511 --> 25:43.145
I got the sense that,

25:43.147 --> 25:45.815
he wanted to swoop in
and act a hero, you know?

25:45.817 --> 25:47.282
- Yeah.
- He even asked me in private

25:47.285 --> 25:48.584
if I could get next to the witness,

25:48.586 --> 25:50.519
and I said that's the
first and last time

25:50.521 --> 25:53.056
you get to ask me that question.

25:53.057 --> 25:54.656
He waved me off like
I was a homeless bum,

25:54.659 --> 25:56.893
but he was dead serious.

25:56.894 --> 25:58.126
Him?

26:00.464 --> 26:01.931
Yeah, that's him.

26:12.977 --> 26:15.411
Well, clearly rehab
did not work for Leo.

26:15.413 --> 26:17.913
Right? Look at this guy.

26:17.915 --> 26:18.980
He is jonesing.

26:18.982 --> 26:21.049
All right.

26:25.123 --> 26:27.390
All right, here we go. Guy's coming in.

26:27.392 --> 26:28.724
- You see him?
- I see him.

26:28.727 --> 26:33.362
Come on, baby. Make that exchange.

26:33.364 --> 26:34.430
All right, that's the exchange.

26:34.432 --> 26:35.498
- Right now?
- Hit it.

26:35.500 --> 26:36.898
Let's go grab him.

26:44.541 --> 26:47.809
Get out of the way!

26:47.811 --> 26:49.711
Stop! Police!

27:02.993 --> 27:04.326
Hey! Spit it out! Spit it out!

27:04.328 --> 27:05.728
Spit it out, Leo!

27:05.730 --> 27:08.131
- Spit it out!
- Don't bite me!

27:08.133 --> 27:09.499
- Here.
- I don't want to touch it.

27:09.500 --> 27:11.500
Shut up.

27:11.502 --> 27:13.435
I'd say you got a
real problem here, Leo.

27:13.438 --> 27:14.836
Such an addict,

27:14.838 --> 27:18.307
you don't toss the drugs when
a couple cops are chasing you?

27:26.317 --> 27:28.049
All right, everybody take a walk.

27:28.051 --> 27:29.251
Really?

27:29.253 --> 27:31.887
- Jeez.
- Now.

27:31.890 --> 27:33.055
Come on.

27:33.057 --> 27:35.423
- Not cool.
- Wow. Great.

27:39.130 --> 27:43.432
Do you know we just popped
your brother for possession?

27:43.433 --> 27:45.167
I don't know how much
experience you have

27:45.170 --> 27:47.670
with junkies that are
looking at jail time,

27:47.672 --> 27:49.939
but they tend to get very...

27:49.941 --> 27:51.207
Chatty.

27:51.209 --> 27:54.777
Why do you keep finding
excuses to talk to me?

27:57.949 --> 28:01.951
I can't let you go out and live it up...

28:01.952 --> 28:06.087
While there's a woman alone, pregnant,

28:06.089 --> 28:10.292
whose husband is gone because of you.

28:10.295 --> 28:14.430
So you're just gonna
keep following me around?

28:14.432 --> 28:16.566
What about if, um...

28:16.567 --> 28:20.803
If I go somewhere private,
someplace nobody knows?

28:20.805 --> 28:22.971
You follow me there?

28:33.317 --> 28:37.185
Do you know what I like about Midori?

28:37.188 --> 28:40.455
Let me guess. It reminds
you of high school.

28:40.458 --> 28:42.825
I get that a lot from girls.

28:42.826 --> 28:44.993
No.

28:48.066 --> 28:49.898
It stains.

28:53.070 --> 28:55.438
Hey. Lick it up.

28:55.440 --> 28:57.105
I know you want to.

29:00.044 --> 29:01.877
Ladies, he usually
puts the date-rape drugs

29:01.880 --> 29:03.144
in the champagne,

29:03.146 --> 29:05.981
but I'd toss all your
drinks just in case.

29:15.519 --> 29:18.086
Hey.

29:24.828 --> 29:27.829
How was rehab in Arizona?

29:27.832 --> 29:31.967
I feel a punch line coming.

29:31.969 --> 29:33.335
Nope.

29:33.336 --> 29:36.471
I'm serious.

29:36.473 --> 29:39.141
You glad you went?

29:39.143 --> 29:41.777
I am, actually.

29:41.778 --> 29:45.513
It's still a struggle
for me, obviously, but...

29:45.516 --> 29:46.781
I'll keep trying.

29:46.784 --> 29:48.817
Well, I know at least
one thing they teach there

29:48.818 --> 29:52.153
is that hiding from the
problems in your life

29:52.155 --> 29:54.589
is not an effective way
of dealing with them.

29:54.592 --> 29:56.325
In fact, not only do those problems

29:56.326 --> 29:57.960
never get tackled...

29:57.961 --> 30:00.796
They fester.

30:00.798 --> 30:03.332
And they create even bigger
problems in your life.

30:03.334 --> 30:05.567
Is that right?

30:05.568 --> 30:07.736
You want the name of my dealer, right?

30:07.738 --> 30:09.570
Right?

30:09.573 --> 30:11.173
Wrong.

30:11.174 --> 30:13.142
I want to know how
you got to the witness

30:13.144 --> 30:14.476
in your brother's trial.

30:18.548 --> 30:20.582
- I didn't get to him.
- Did you try?

30:22.686 --> 30:24.519
For a minute.

30:24.521 --> 30:26.954
But then I realized the insanity
of it all, and I let it go.

30:26.957 --> 30:28.523
But your brother put
you up to it, right?

30:28.526 --> 30:31.059
He made his desires known,

30:31.061 --> 30:34.596
but h-he didn't put
anybody up to anything.

30:34.597 --> 30:36.365
How did the witness get killed, Leo?

30:36.366 --> 30:38.933
I have no idea.

30:38.935 --> 30:41.236
All we have to do is lift
the prints off the gun

30:41.238 --> 30:42.671
and the fingerprints off the apartment

30:42.673 --> 30:43.939
where the gun was stashed at.

30:43.941 --> 30:45.473
You asked me to be
honest. I'm being honest.

30:45.476 --> 30:47.175
I don't know anything about a gun

30:47.177 --> 30:49.744
or... or an apartment or anything.

30:49.747 --> 30:51.413
Where were you last night?

30:51.414 --> 30:55.917
I was at my friend's apartment off rush.

30:55.920 --> 31:00.455
There were four people there
that can attest to that.

31:00.458 --> 31:01.757
You're a three-time loser, Leo.

31:02.926 --> 31:04.425
You're facing some real
jail time right now,

31:04.428 --> 31:06.929
and this is your one
chance to help yourself out.

31:06.931 --> 31:09.964
I didn't do anything to that witness.

31:09.967 --> 31:12.401
Okay, I'm a lot of things.
I've made a lot of mistakes.

31:12.403 --> 31:16.471
I-I've disappointed a lot of people.

31:16.473 --> 31:18.807
But I'm not a killer.

31:26.317 --> 31:27.648
Stone called.

31:27.651 --> 31:30.685
Tuxhorn's lawyer is
pushing for a motion to dismiss.

31:30.688 --> 31:32.554
Stone needs to know if
we got a leg to stand on.

31:32.556 --> 31:34.522
How long until he needs to decide?

31:34.525 --> 31:37.159
24 hours.

31:37.161 --> 31:39.327
All right, check out Leo's alibi.

31:39.329 --> 31:40.496
Copy.

31:55.945 --> 31:58.913
Did you post that on Facebook?

32:01.417 --> 32:02.917
Yeah.

32:06.457 --> 32:07.623
Couple of buddies of mine...

32:07.625 --> 32:09.724
We just share crazy stuff we see.

32:09.727 --> 32:14.128
So you illegally accessed
a CPD administrative server

32:14.131 --> 32:17.799
to capture video from
your city-issued body cam

32:17.801 --> 32:19.300
for one purpose...

32:19.303 --> 32:22.136
To humiliate a citizen of this city,

32:22.138 --> 32:25.840
the same city we took an oath to protect

32:25.843 --> 32:28.644
from bullies like you.

32:28.645 --> 32:30.578
Other cops do it, too, Sergeant.

32:30.580 --> 32:33.182
I mean, more than you probably realize.

32:33.183 --> 32:34.883
So you knew about this.

32:34.884 --> 32:37.152
I...

32:43.594 --> 32:46.795
I didn't know that he was
gonna post it on social media.

32:49.767 --> 32:51.732
Starting tomorrow, you're both walking

32:51.734 --> 32:55.103
CHA vertical foot patrol
in the Lathrop homes.

32:55.105 --> 32:57.638
And, Sorensen, in your case,

32:57.641 --> 32:59.607
that's only because I
don't have the authority

32:59.609 --> 33:02.344
to suspend you myself,
you stupid son of a bitch.

33:02.346 --> 33:05.780
But believe me, I'm working on it.

33:05.782 --> 33:07.782
Get out of my sight...

33:07.785 --> 33:09.617
Both of you...

33:09.619 --> 33:11.118
Now.

33:13.723 --> 33:16.157
- Did you rat me out?
- No.

33:18.127 --> 33:19.994
But now I wish I would have.

33:24.535 --> 33:26.367
Hey, boss.

33:26.369 --> 33:29.304
- We got something here.
- Okay.

33:29.306 --> 33:30.771
All right.

33:30.773 --> 33:32.473
Take it away there, Chris. Okay.

33:32.476 --> 33:34.675
So each and every Tuxhorn property

33:34.677 --> 33:36.211
has its own profit and loss statement

33:36.212 --> 33:37.546
and its own manager.

33:37.548 --> 33:39.448
With access to all
associated accounts, right?

33:39.450 --> 33:41.215
Money comes in,
money goes out regular,

33:41.218 --> 33:44.219
except this one property in Dubai.

33:44.221 --> 33:45.988
Place isn't even open yet,
but it's showing profits

33:45.990 --> 33:48.757
of $100,000 a year,
going back four years.

33:48.759 --> 33:50.893
Yeah, so it's clearly a shell.

33:50.894 --> 33:52.760
- They've been dumping money.
- But a week ago,

33:52.762 --> 33:56.030
there's one large cash
withdrawal... $300,000.

33:56.032 --> 33:58.700
And only one person could have
pulled it out... the manager.

33:58.701 --> 34:00.669
Who's that?

34:00.671 --> 34:03.672
Sloane Tuxhorn, Oliver's sister.

34:03.673 --> 34:05.039
Well, that still doesn't help us,

34:05.041 --> 34:07.041
not if we can't link her
and the money back to Oliver.

34:07.044 --> 34:09.478
She's not on the visitor
or call logs to the jail.

34:09.480 --> 34:10.612
She never emailed him.

34:10.614 --> 34:11.880
There's no proof they communicated.

34:11.882 --> 34:13.547
Well, maybe there is.

34:13.550 --> 34:15.751
That number, 300,000,
that rang a bell, right?

34:15.753 --> 34:18.219
So I went back through Oliver's
Facebook posts that he made

34:18.222 --> 34:19.554
while he was still in prison.

34:19.556 --> 34:21.989
He commented on a post
that his sister Sloane made

34:21.992 --> 34:25.527
about his getting release, and I quote,

34:25.527 --> 34:28.429
"wouldn't 300,000 likes be rad...

34:28.431 --> 34:31.300
If that happened?"

34:31.302 --> 34:35.402
300,000, rad... Jim Radovick.

34:35.405 --> 34:37.306
Okay, when was this?

34:37.306 --> 34:40.541
Two days before the murder

34:40.543 --> 34:41.976
it's not enough to charge her.

34:41.978 --> 34:43.512
It's enough to bluff her, though.

34:43.514 --> 34:45.146
- We got eyes on her?
- We do.

34:45.148 --> 34:46.414
Get her ass in here.

34:58.518 --> 35:01.652
<i>It's Jim Radovick's statement.</i>

35:04.289 --> 35:07.257
Yeah, he's in the
interview room next door.

35:10.496 --> 35:14.197
Says the whole thing was your idea.

35:14.199 --> 35:18.469
You wanted the witness
killed, arranged payment.

35:18.471 --> 35:20.905
You're the mastermind, basically.

35:20.907 --> 35:22.239
Well, he's lying.

35:22.242 --> 35:26.077
Everybody lies, Sloane,
one way or another.

35:26.079 --> 35:29.414
What matters is credibility...

35:29.416 --> 35:32.250
In front of a judge, in front of a jury,

35:32.251 --> 35:33.851
in front of us.

35:36.889 --> 35:39.956
Right now you're looking
at obstruction of justice.

35:39.958 --> 35:42.193
It's a class 4 felony.

35:42.195 --> 35:44.929
You'll do a year, maybe two.

35:44.931 --> 35:47.065
<i>That's if you cooperate</i>

35:47.067 --> 35:50.001
and give a full statement.

35:50.003 --> 35:54.072
We go with Radovick's version,
you're looking at bribery,

35:54.074 --> 35:55.907
witness tampering,

35:55.909 --> 35:58.643
and soliciting a murderer.

35:58.644 --> 36:01.378
That's a class 2 felony.

36:01.380 --> 36:03.681
You will do ten years.

36:11.690 --> 36:12.956
Radovick's an ex-cop.

36:12.958 --> 36:14.458
I'm happy to go with his version.

36:14.460 --> 36:17.394
I just got him the money.

36:17.396 --> 36:20.197
That's it.

36:20.199 --> 36:22.432
Radovick said it would
take a boatload of money

36:22.434 --> 36:23.534
to get him to do it.

36:26.739 --> 36:30.708
So I offered 300,000, and
he said we were in business.

36:34.280 --> 36:38.382
How did he get the
identity of the witness?

36:38.384 --> 36:41.585
I don't know, but he did.

36:44.690 --> 36:47.224
And the money was only to get
the witness to change his story,

36:47.226 --> 36:49.559
not kill him.

36:49.561 --> 36:51.561
But something went wrong.

36:54.067 --> 36:57.235
And Oliver told you to do this...

36:57.237 --> 36:59.570
The Facebook post from in jail.

37:04.744 --> 37:07.043
Yes.

37:13.418 --> 37:15.418
Hey, Al

37:15.420 --> 37:17.755
Jim.

37:17.757 --> 37:20.690
So what's the latest?
You get the brother?

37:20.693 --> 37:22.927
You know, driving over here,

37:22.929 --> 37:26.030
I remembered one of
the things that, um...

37:26.032 --> 37:28.266
That got you fired from the job...

37:30.235 --> 37:33.003
Making false arrests.

37:38.610 --> 37:42.947
You're seriously gonna
take Leo's word over mine?

37:42.949 --> 37:45.715
Not his. His sister's.

37:48.887 --> 37:51.822
She laid it all out.

37:54.393 --> 37:56.827
Put your hands up, Jim.

37:56.829 --> 37:59.130
Put your hands up.

37:59.132 --> 38:01.731
I got kids, Al.

38:01.733 --> 38:05.001
Put your hands up, man. Come on.

38:10.175 --> 38:12.409
You listen to me, okay?

38:16.081 --> 38:17.414
I went...

38:17.416 --> 38:20.918
I went to talk to Tariq,
offer him some money.

38:20.920 --> 38:22.786
Okay?

38:22.789 --> 38:24.755
He reached into his pocket.
I thought it was a gun.

38:24.757 --> 38:26.590
So I drew.

38:26.592 --> 38:29.025
I saw it was a phone when he went down.

38:29.027 --> 38:31.528
Okay, but him getting shot...

38:31.530 --> 38:34.297
That's not premeditated.

38:34.300 --> 38:36.233
Okay, Al? That's important.

38:36.235 --> 38:38.869
You got to put that
in your report, right?

38:38.871 --> 38:40.304
It's not premeditated.

38:40.306 --> 38:42.505
What about the part where
you break into a man's home,

38:42.507 --> 38:47.043
plant a weapon, and get paid 300 grand?

38:47.045 --> 38:48.713
Was that premeditated?

39:01.027 --> 39:03.628
Where's that little smile today, Oliver?

39:08.501 --> 39:10.034
You know, of all the people you hurt,

39:10.036 --> 39:13.670
you can add one more to
the list... your sister.

39:13.672 --> 39:16.673
State's Attorney's gonna
push for three years.

39:40.900 --> 39:42.632
You're pissed. You're miserable.

39:42.635 --> 39:44.068
You want a new partner.

39:44.070 --> 39:46.336
I get it, but, Burgess,
it is not that easy.

39:46.338 --> 39:48.239
You're just gonna have to suck it up.

39:48.240 --> 39:50.273
I didn't say anything.

39:52.077 --> 39:55.579
- You're right. You didn't.
- Yeah.

39:57.215 --> 40:00.418
I'm doing all I can.

40:00.420 --> 40:01.418
I know.

40:05.057 --> 40:08.159
- Hey.
- Hey.

40:08.161 --> 40:10.894
Nothing. I'll catch you later.

40:16.534 --> 40:20.371
All I ever wanted to
be was a Chicago cop.

40:20.373 --> 40:22.440
Well, it sounds like
you still would be...

40:22.442 --> 40:23.907
Still bringing down the bad guys,

40:23.909 --> 40:27.644
still serving your city,
just changing locations.

40:31.083 --> 40:33.751
This guy Stone...

40:33.753 --> 40:35.418
I like him.

40:35.420 --> 40:37.722
He's a straight shooter,

40:37.724 --> 40:41.458
doesn't play politics,
fights for the right things.

40:41.460 --> 40:42.893
I could go to battle with him.

40:42.894 --> 40:45.563
How often can you say
that about somebody?

40:45.565 --> 40:47.498
Yeah.

40:47.500 --> 40:50.367
You also got to think of
this as a life question,

40:50.369 --> 40:53.871
not just a job question, you know?

40:53.873 --> 40:55.472
I mean, when I went over to Ambo,

40:55.474 --> 40:59.175
it really helped me out
in terms of home life,

40:59.177 --> 41:00.844
big-time.

41:00.847 --> 41:03.347
Would the hours be normal?

41:03.349 --> 41:04.547
Normal-ish,

41:04.550 --> 41:08.219
not like Intelligence hours.

41:08.221 --> 41:11.554
'Cause Diego's race that you missed...

41:11.556 --> 41:13.289
He won.

41:24.670 --> 41:27.905
- Hey.
- Hey.

41:27.907 --> 41:30.141
Thanks for your help.

41:30.143 --> 41:31.909
It's a team effort.

41:31.911 --> 41:36.679
Tariq never should have slipped
through protective custody.

41:36.681 --> 41:40.016
That one's gonna haunt me.

41:40.018 --> 41:42.920
Looks like you need a
new lead investigator.

41:42.922 --> 41:46.423
You know of a good one?

41:46.425 --> 41:48.659
Me.

41:53.099 --> 41:56.032
I was hoping for some good news.

41:56.034 --> 41:58.202
Welcome aboard, Antonio.

41:58.204 --> 42:00.905
Looking forward to working with you.

42:05.677 --> 42:08.778
5021 George, hold us down
on a personal at 4800 Hazel.

42:08.780 --> 42:11.315
<i>10-4, we're holding you down.</i>

42:11.317 --> 42:14.117
This is silly. You've already met her.

42:14.119 --> 42:16.186
But now we're dating, so it's...

42:16.188 --> 42:17.887
- Hold on, this was your idea.
- Yeah, I know.

42:17.889 --> 42:19.856
But I was a little drunk
and feeling sentimental.

42:19.858 --> 42:21.391
We don't need to do this.

42:21.393 --> 42:22.992
It's gonna be fine.

42:22.994 --> 42:26.197
Okay, there was zero
parking on the street

42:26.199 --> 42:27.764
and when I went around
to the parking lot,

42:27.766 --> 42:30.367
it was $20 a day, flat fee.

42:30.369 --> 42:31.936
Okay, Mom. Nobody wants to

42:31.938 --> 42:34.637
hear about parking problems, ever.

42:34.639 --> 42:35.639
It's good to see you, Bunny.

42:35.641 --> 42:37.875
Jay, nice to meet you formally.

42:40.313 --> 42:43.347
So... Jay and I are living together now.

42:43.349 --> 42:47.585
I've heard a lot of
good things about you.

42:47.586 --> 42:49.920
No, you haven't.

42:49.922 --> 42:52.755
Okay. Let's just keep
this short and sweet,

42:52.757 --> 42:54.190
even if we all have to fake it.

42:54.193 --> 42:57.494
Sweetheart, I've been
meaning to call you Beca...

42:57.496 --> 43:00.530
Jay, would you mind? Could
we just have one minute?

43:00.532 --> 43:02.967
- Sure.
- No.

43:04.603 --> 43:06.237
What is wrong with you?

43:06.239 --> 43:08.806
What do you need? Do
you need to borrow money?

43:08.807 --> 43:10.574
You can't just come have
breakfast with my boyfriend

43:10.576 --> 43:12.576
and be nice and leave it at that?

43:12.577 --> 43:14.811
We need to talk.

43:14.813 --> 43:18.248
Then talk.

43:18.251 --> 43:22.686
<i>...10-1, 10-1, 2622, shots fired.</i>

43:22.688 --> 43:24.755
<i>Patrol 2622, you have the air.</i>

43:24.757 --> 43:26.422
<i>- I need a location.
- I need to talk.</i>

43:26.425 --> 43:28.324
<i>Officer down, my partner's been shot.</i>

43:28.327 --> 43:30.193
<i>- 650 North State.
- We gotta go.</i>

43:30.195 --> 43:32.929
<i>Officer shot. Please send help!</i>

43:32.931 --> 43:34.130
<i>All units stay off the air.</i>

43:43.809 --> 43:45.442
We have to get him up!

43:45.443 --> 43:48.144
I can't move him on my own.
I can't... I can't get a pulse!

43:48.146 --> 43:49.813
All right, all right, come on, come on!

43:49.815 --> 43:51.248
Let's go, let's go.

43:51.250 --> 43:53.784
- Where did the shot come from?
- I don't know!

43:55.521 --> 43:58.222
5021 George, we're
on scene of the 10-1.

43:58.224 --> 43:59.222
Keep the cars keep coming.

43:59.224 --> 44:00.757
We got an active shooter in the area.

44:00.760 --> 44:02.293
Notify responding units there's
plain clothes at the scene.

44:02.295 --> 44:04.460
I need all intersections blocked to Med.

44:04.463 --> 44:06.463
Have a supervisor initiate
an officer down detail.

44:06.465 --> 44:07.998
Come on, buddy. Come on!

44:09.768 --> 44:11.568
It's gotta be a south-facing balcony.

44:13.672 --> 44:16.139
- See anything?
- Nothing.

44:18.643 --> 44:20.978
Stay with me, Anthony! Stay with me!

44:20.980 --> 44:22.746
No, back inside, back inside.

44:22.748 --> 44:24.447
All right, hey, no one
leaves this building.

44:24.449 --> 44:27.418
Get me some units around back.
Have them cover all sides.

44:42.768 --> 44:45.536
All right, go door-to-door.
Gather everyone in the lobby.

44:45.538 --> 44:47.804
Everyone gets interviewed.

44:59.050 --> 45:01.518
Hello, Sarge.

45:01.519 --> 45:03.454
Probationary officer that was shot

45:03.456 --> 45:04.855
is Anthony O'Sullivan.

45:04.856 --> 45:06.824
He was responding to a man
in the lobby with a gun.

45:06.826 --> 45:09.525
So we're searching the
whole complex right now.

45:09.527 --> 45:11.561
He was only two months
out of the academy, Sarge.

45:11.563 --> 45:13.731
What's his training officer say?

45:13.733 --> 45:15.032
He's on his way to Med right now,

45:15.034 --> 45:17.668
but he said he didn't
hear or see the shot.

45:17.670 --> 45:22.039
Well, the original call
was a man with a gun.

45:23.809 --> 45:27.677
Get me the time and location.
And make sure the kid's family

45:27.679 --> 45:30.146
- is headed over to the hospital.
- Copy.

45:31.784 --> 45:33.751
Sarge, we need you up here, boss.

45:33.753 --> 45:34.751
Eighth floor.

45:44.630 --> 45:46.597
Single .223 round.

45:46.599 --> 45:48.632
Probably an AR-15.

45:59.744 --> 46:01.512
This was an execution.

46:09.635 --> 46:11.704
Shooter's in the wind. It's unknown

46:11.706 --> 46:13.539
how many offenders at this
time. Looks like he or they

46:13.541 --> 46:15.240
were lying in wait.

46:15.242 --> 46:17.842
- Only one shot fired.
- If this is like Dallas,

46:17.844 --> 46:20.012
we need to worry about contagion.

46:20.014 --> 46:22.914
Sympathizers, copycats.
I'll keep details limited.

46:22.916 --> 46:26.385
We're in contact with
CPIC, FBI and Homeland.

46:26.387 --> 46:28.653
Running every active
threat against police.

46:28.655 --> 46:32.090
Hank, I want you running point on this.

46:32.092 --> 46:33.458
City-wide.

46:33.460 --> 46:35.094
Yeah.

46:43.036 --> 46:44.769
Forensics and the
crime lab are processing

46:44.771 --> 46:46.338
- the scene right now.
- All right.

46:46.340 --> 46:48.407
I'll canvass the alley for
personal security cameras

46:48.409 --> 46:50.576
- and I'll run pods, all right?
- Yeah.

46:53.581 --> 46:56.181
Yeah, I knew this kid, O.

46:56.184 --> 46:59.418
He was in the search warrant
class I taught at the academy.

47:01.688 --> 47:03.755
He was gonna be good police.

47:03.757 --> 47:05.490
Come on.

47:05.492 --> 47:07.126
Gotta keep moving.

47:07.128 --> 47:08.494
Come on.

47:09.730 --> 47:11.764
Yeah.

47:13.481 --> 47:15.681
We pulled up down the block.

47:15.682 --> 47:17.148
Anthony got out of the squad first.

47:17.150 --> 47:19.050
- I was right behind him.
- Okay.

47:19.052 --> 47:22.954
I glanced down the street,
and then... he dropped.

47:22.956 --> 47:25.056
After the shot, did
you see any movement?

47:25.059 --> 47:26.592
I didn't see.

47:26.594 --> 47:28.594
You didn't see or hear anything?

47:28.596 --> 47:29.628
There wasn't anything.

47:29.630 --> 47:32.197
There was no gunshot, no muzzle flash.

47:32.199 --> 47:34.666
It happened so fast, I didn't see...

47:35.735 --> 47:38.670
I was his eyes. I just didn't see.

47:41.307 --> 47:44.610
Nothing you could have done
would have prevented that.

47:46.547 --> 47:49.581
Know that.

47:49.583 --> 47:52.117
That's Anthony's parents.

48:00.527 --> 48:03.295
My god.

48:03.297 --> 48:04.362
Hey.

48:09.103 --> 48:10.635
I'm sorry.

48:11.905 --> 48:14.873
We did everything we could.

48:26.454 --> 48:28.253
I'm very sorry.

48:35.896 --> 48:39.697
Anthony O'Sullivan. He
grew up in Sauganash.

48:39.699 --> 48:41.900
Still lived there with his parents.

48:41.902 --> 48:44.869
He was class commander and
graduated first of his class

48:44.871 --> 48:47.206
from the academy two months ago.

48:47.208 --> 48:49.641
Here, I only pulled
our latest and greatest

48:49.643 --> 48:51.876
active threats to police.

48:51.878 --> 48:53.744
Yeah, we got two white separatists

48:53.746 --> 48:56.715
aligned with two anti-government groups.

48:56.717 --> 48:59.550
And our top six are bangers who attended

48:59.552 --> 49:01.253
a summit last month.

49:01.255 --> 49:02.855
Three West Side gangs
were in attendance.

49:02.856 --> 49:04.989
They vowed to kill police
officers for the killing

49:04.992 --> 49:06.724
of young black men.

49:06.726 --> 49:08.293
Word on the street is they had snipers

49:08.295 --> 49:10.027
on the roof last night.

49:10.030 --> 49:11.864
So patrol still has no suspects.

49:11.865 --> 49:14.065
There was no 911 calls for shots fired.

49:14.068 --> 49:15.434
So we're thinking that the shooter used

49:15.436 --> 49:17.969
a flash suppressant and a silencer.

49:17.972 --> 49:21.306
And most likely was
monitoring our radios.

49:21.307 --> 49:23.842
Nothing off ballistics. Bullet
doesn't match a gun on file.

49:26.246 --> 49:28.246
Your office.

49:30.384 --> 49:32.851
So start narrowing.

49:32.853 --> 49:36.755
Who has access to a gun,
who's online spewing hate.

49:36.757 --> 49:39.724
And I don't care if that
crime scene was licked clean.

49:39.726 --> 49:42.293
There's a path that leads
straight to that balcony.

49:45.766 --> 49:47.833
Hey, man, um...

49:50.103 --> 49:51.969
Jeremy at the State's
Attorney's office has been

49:51.972 --> 49:54.039
running his mouth.

49:54.041 --> 49:56.307
He said that you're
taking a job over there

49:56.309 --> 49:59.311
as their lead investigator?

49:59.313 --> 50:00.945
Is that true?

50:00.947 --> 50:03.782
I did take the job.

50:03.784 --> 50:04.849
What?

50:04.851 --> 50:07.085
Yeah.

50:07.086 --> 50:08.887
Start Monday.

50:10.891 --> 50:13.125
I was gonna tell you
guys earlier, but...

50:16.530 --> 50:18.563
Come on, we got work to do.

50:23.369 --> 50:26.070
Superintendent wants a press conference.

50:26.072 --> 50:28.440
What happened to limited details?

50:28.442 --> 50:30.342
We need to consider Chicago's climate.

50:30.344 --> 50:32.978
That's exactly what I'm considering.

50:32.980 --> 50:34.780
Have you seen the board out there?

50:34.782 --> 50:36.882
I got a white cop shot from a rooftop

50:36.884 --> 50:39.050
and a half a dozen
black males as suspects.

50:40.353 --> 50:42.286
Got a pop off cell towers
at the shooting site.

50:42.289 --> 50:44.088
Booker Ford. He's on our short list.

50:44.090 --> 50:45.590
Associated with the corner hustlers.

50:45.592 --> 50:46.925
CPIC's got him pinged for making

50:46.927 --> 50:48.492
online threats towards the police.

50:48.494 --> 50:50.795
He's got a failure to
appear warrant out on him,

50:50.797 --> 50:53.097
and his cell hit the tower
within two hours of shooting.

50:53.099 --> 50:54.932
- Hit it.
- We got it.

51:03.077 --> 51:05.077
Ruzek, get the front.

51:19.492 --> 51:20.858
All right, hit it.

51:20.860 --> 51:21.893
Chicago PD!

51:21.894 --> 51:23.594
Chicago PD!

51:34.340 --> 51:36.074
Police!

51:41.514 --> 51:42.581
Go!

51:59.233 --> 52:00.599
Don't move!

52:00.601 --> 52:02.668
Get on the ground! On the ground!

52:02.670 --> 52:04.335
Don't move. Don't move.

52:04.338 --> 52:05.804
You good?

52:05.806 --> 52:07.739
Yeah.

52:17.418 --> 52:21.420
So it's all true. Great and mighty CPD

52:21.422 --> 52:25.389
throws me in a black site
for resisting arrest.!

52:25.391 --> 52:28.693
"Gut them pigs and give 'em wings."

52:28.695 --> 52:30.061
I like this one.

52:30.063 --> 52:32.664
"We need to slit them end to end."

52:32.666 --> 52:34.266
- That's just talk.
- Well, that's not just talk

52:34.268 --> 52:37.536
- when a cop gets shot.
- I didn't kill any cop.

52:40.740 --> 52:42.606
Your cell phone puts
you right in the area.

52:42.608 --> 52:44.509
I was out driving this morning.

52:44.510 --> 52:46.677
I didn't kill anybody.

52:46.679 --> 52:50.581
"Going out to slaughter
the first pig I see."

52:50.583 --> 52:54.418
I watched every video you posted online.

52:54.420 --> 52:57.389
You seemed awful sure of yourself.

52:57.391 --> 52:59.157
Now it's just talk?

52:59.159 --> 53:02.594
Now that it's real, and the blood's dry?

53:02.826 --> 53:05.293
What, you gonna just
curl up in a little ball?

53:05.295 --> 53:08.730
- Own up to it.
- If I killed the police,

53:08.731 --> 53:11.666
I wouldn't waste a bullet on a kid.

53:11.668 --> 53:14.402
I'd go after one of the old-timers.

53:14.403 --> 53:15.971
Just like you...

53:15.972 --> 53:18.373
Where all our problems really started.

53:19.876 --> 53:21.076
Go ahead. Go ahead.

53:21.077 --> 53:23.143
Beat another black man who's cuffed.

53:23.146 --> 53:25.079
Show me what we both already know.

53:25.081 --> 53:26.648
Boss.

53:29.820 --> 53:31.018
What?

53:31.021 --> 53:32.920
We got something.

53:46.936 --> 53:48.335
So a pod caught the truck

53:48.338 --> 53:50.005
leaving the alley right
after the shooting.

53:50.007 --> 53:52.606
It was the only vehicle
to do so within our window.

53:52.608 --> 53:54.309
Next thing we know, this traffic light

53:54.311 --> 53:57.478
- snaps the truck two miles away.
- I ran the plates.

53:57.481 --> 54:00.849
It was stolen from an auto park
in Downers Grove ten months ago.

54:00.851 --> 54:02.583
Tact team found it
parked one block north.

54:02.585 --> 54:03.751
And they're still sitting on it.

54:03.753 --> 54:04.952
All right, take it.

54:04.954 --> 54:06.588
- Bring Jay and Lindsay.
- All right, Sarge.

54:06.590 --> 54:09.923
- Anything from Booker yet?
- Take it means go now.

54:11.360 --> 54:12.559
Copy.

54:15.097 --> 54:16.463
They don't want cops in this city?

54:16.465 --> 54:17.965
That's fine. Let's pull
out. Let's pull out.

54:17.967 --> 54:20.501
Let them police themselves.
See how long that lasts.

54:24.074 --> 54:25.440
Right down there.

54:25.442 --> 54:27.608
Car's parked at the tail
end of a dead end alley.

54:27.610 --> 54:29.077
- No one's approached.
- Did you see any movement

54:29.079 --> 54:31.146
- inside the vehicle?
- No. Plain clothes walked by.

54:31.148 --> 54:33.148
- Car looks cold.
- Looks like he ditched it.

54:33.150 --> 54:35.583
- We almost missed it back there.
- We'll approach with you,

54:35.585 --> 54:37.152
just in case he's in there laying low.

54:37.153 --> 54:38.686
- All right.
- Let's go.

54:46.963 --> 54:49.731
Chicago PD! Anybody in the car,

54:49.733 --> 54:51.865
come out with your hands up.

54:55.605 --> 54:57.639
Is that your radio?

54:57.641 --> 54:59.474
I think so, yeah.

55:02.079 --> 55:03.478
Wait, wait. Hold up.

55:04.880 --> 55:06.547
Something doesn't feel right.

55:06.550 --> 55:08.115
Erin, check your radio.

55:11.353 --> 55:13.054
- Get down!
- Riley!

55:15.192 --> 55:16.623
Where did that come from?

55:18.802 --> 55:20.503
- Riley!
- We're going! Cover us!

55:20.505 --> 55:23.940
Go get your squad!
Go get your squad! Go!

55:23.942 --> 55:26.041
Where is he? Where is he?

55:27.978 --> 55:29.746
Ten o'clock on the roof!

55:32.884 --> 55:34.851
I got her! Go, go, go, go!

55:38.422 --> 55:41.291
Hold on! Hold on! Riley, hold on!

55:46.097 --> 55:47.262
Cover us!

55:47.264 --> 55:48.530
- We got you!
- Come on, come on!

55:54.371 --> 55:56.972
Come on! Come on, get
us the hell out of here!

56:02.047 --> 56:04.047
- He's moving!
- Garcia, you get on the horn!

56:04.048 --> 56:06.416
You call a 10-1 right
now! We need backup!

56:06.418 --> 56:08.717
- Copy that!
- Lock down the block!

56:08.719 --> 56:10.487
- Let's go, let's go.
- Go, go!

56:19.731 --> 56:21.831
You're clear.

56:21.833 --> 56:23.632
We got a rope.

56:29.007 --> 56:30.907
He rappelled down.

56:30.909 --> 56:33.543
<i>Need a location.</i>

56:33.545 --> 56:35.844
5021 George, we're
on scene of the 10-1.

56:35.847 --> 56:38.081
We got an officer inbound with
a gunshot wound to the head.

56:38.083 --> 56:39.215
Offender believed to be on foot,

56:39.217 --> 56:40.416
heading westbound on the rooftops.

56:40.418 --> 56:42.085
- Roll air one.
- Easy.

56:42.086 --> 56:43.887
Here.

56:51.362 --> 56:53.829
- Talk to me!
- She's been down eight minutes.

56:53.831 --> 56:55.465
All right, let's get her on the gurney.

56:55.467 --> 56:58.067
Will, I can't move my hands.

57:00.271 --> 57:01.938
All right. I got her.

57:01.940 --> 57:03.639
- Okay.
- I got her.

57:05.010 --> 57:07.242
Let's go, keep moving.

57:21.860 --> 57:24.360
Um, Will...

57:24.362 --> 57:26.295
Will says that she,

57:26.297 --> 57:28.398
she died before she hit the
ground, for whatever the...

57:30.034 --> 57:32.034
Okay.

57:32.036 --> 57:34.637
So we know area central and patrol

57:34.639 --> 57:35.972
shut the whole block down.

57:35.974 --> 57:37.873
I know a perimeter search is underway,

57:37.876 --> 57:40.043
but every camera in
the area was vandalized.

57:40.045 --> 57:41.643
The highway was spitting distance.

57:41.646 --> 57:43.445
- Did we get a look at him?
- Boss, he kept low.

57:43.447 --> 57:47.550
This guy, the way he
shot... He was trained.

57:47.552 --> 57:48.985
He was military!

57:48.987 --> 57:50.619
The truck was a lure! It was bait!

57:50.621 --> 57:52.755
We never should have been in the alley.

57:52.757 --> 57:54.324
That son of a bitch
knew we'd come in hot.

57:54.326 --> 57:56.960
We had no cover. He had
a remote vantage point.

57:56.961 --> 57:58.427
Triangulated us from above.

57:58.429 --> 58:00.864
And then we were
freaking target practice!

58:00.865 --> 58:02.498
He jammed our frequency.

58:02.500 --> 58:05.434
All the cell phones and the
radios, they were all down.

58:05.436 --> 58:07.769
Put a call into OEMC and tech lab.

58:07.771 --> 58:09.371
Let me know as soon as you hear.

58:09.373 --> 58:11.007
Ballistics are a match.

58:11.009 --> 58:12.574
Bullets came from the
same gun as the weapon

58:12.577 --> 58:13.710
that killed Anthony.

58:13.711 --> 58:15.110
Truck's being processed for prints.

58:15.112 --> 58:18.447
It's possible Booker
maybe had an accomplice?

58:18.449 --> 58:20.849
I mean, that cat might hate the police,

58:20.851 --> 58:22.418
but he never left the
West Side of Chicago.

58:22.420 --> 58:24.387
I checked his financials
and his online movements.

58:24.389 --> 58:26.489
I mean, his only online
fingerprint is Facebook.

58:26.490 --> 58:29.559
I just don't see this cat
hooking up with an army sniper.

58:29.561 --> 58:32.427
We hold him for 48, but
we go with what we know.

58:32.429 --> 58:33.996
There's an active shooter

58:33.998 --> 58:36.932
targeting the Chicago Police Department.

58:36.934 --> 58:40.036
We got 200 more enemies
just like Booker.

58:40.038 --> 58:42.771
So we keep narrowing down this board,

58:42.773 --> 58:46.909
based on training in
military and law enforcement.

58:46.911 --> 58:48.577
And we hit every single one.

58:48.579 --> 58:52.447
Hey, I got one. Robert Dean,
pinged from the tip line.

58:52.449 --> 58:55.251
Two neighbors overheard Dean
boasting about the shootings.

58:55.253 --> 58:57.619
He's a dishonorable discharge
from the naval reserves.

58:57.621 --> 58:59.588
He's been jailed twice since.

58:59.590 --> 59:01.590
Believes he was set up by the cops.

59:01.592 --> 59:03.492
CPIC's had him on watch for six months,

59:03.494 --> 59:05.061
and he's on parole for resisting arrest.

59:05.063 --> 59:07.429
Okay, so we move on him first.

59:07.431 --> 59:10.733
Call Crowley. Tell her to go
ahead with the press conference.

59:10.735 --> 59:13.503
And today, two Chicago police officers

59:13.505 --> 59:15.637
were targeted and murdered.

59:15.639 --> 59:18.106
For one reason only:

59:18.108 --> 59:21.376
Because they were police officers.

59:23.614 --> 59:28.583
Those officers...
Will never return home.

59:28.585 --> 59:29.818
<i>Every day,</i>

59:29.820 --> 59:31.820
you risk your lives for this city.

59:31.822 --> 59:33.655
For the people you love.

59:33.657 --> 59:35.525
For your families, your friends.

59:35.527 --> 59:37.126
And for strangers.

59:37.128 --> 59:39.295
And for those who resent you.

59:40.831 --> 59:43.266
Your job is to still protect them.

59:43.268 --> 59:45.001
No threat changes that.

59:45.003 --> 59:47.869
You serve. You protect.

59:47.871 --> 59:51.139
And you all come home tonight.

59:56.246 --> 59:57.947
Dismissed.

01:00:02.887 --> 01:00:05.722
Okay, bring it in. Listen up!

01:00:05.724 --> 01:00:07.690
Listen up.

01:00:07.692 --> 01:00:11.126
Our target is Robert Dean.

01:00:11.128 --> 01:00:14.030
We're gonna hit him quick and clean.

01:00:15.333 --> 01:00:17.132
All right, let's do it.

01:00:34.286 --> 01:00:35.684
Place is empty.

01:00:36.855 --> 01:00:39.956
<i>Nobody's home. We got eyes?</i>

01:00:39.958 --> 01:00:41.523
Nothing yet.

01:00:42.460 --> 01:00:43.525
Erin.

01:00:47.132 --> 01:00:49.264
Black four door sedan, coming your way.

01:00:54.105 --> 01:00:56.438
That's a positive. That's him.

01:00:58.342 --> 01:00:59.775
What's he doing?

01:01:02.614 --> 01:01:04.447
He made us. Move!

01:01:17.528 --> 01:01:21.664
Do not move! Turn the
car off, nice and slow!

01:01:21.666 --> 01:01:24.032
Now put your hands outside the vehicle.

01:01:24.034 --> 01:01:26.335
Do it, or we will light you up!

01:01:26.338 --> 01:01:27.903
Do it now!

01:01:34.079 --> 01:01:35.878
Pop the trunk.

01:01:50.628 --> 01:01:53.362
I hope every cop in
this city gets smoked.

01:01:53.364 --> 01:01:54.563
Shut up.

01:01:54.565 --> 01:01:56.465
Get him in the cage.

01:02:09.750 --> 01:02:11.751
The average citizen
is 60 times more likely

01:02:11.753 --> 01:02:14.686
to be killed by a cop than a terrorist.

01:02:14.688 --> 01:02:16.422
Sixty times!

01:02:18.559 --> 01:02:21.161
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:02:21.163 --> 01:02:23.262
If you guys are gonna keep
on murdering innocent people,

01:02:23.264 --> 01:02:25.364
and we don't fight back,
it's gonna get worse.

01:02:25.367 --> 01:02:26.766
We'll be living in a police state,

01:02:26.768 --> 01:02:28.601
if we aren't already.

01:02:28.603 --> 01:02:30.103
So yeah, sorry.

01:02:30.105 --> 01:02:32.371
Glad two of your own were killed.

01:02:32.373 --> 01:02:34.173
Blood needs to spill in a revolution.

01:02:34.175 --> 01:02:36.275
That what you're hoping for?

01:02:36.277 --> 01:02:38.277
Shot heard 'round the world?

01:02:40.648 --> 01:02:41.780
This is the part you're gonna hate.

01:02:41.782 --> 01:02:43.983
It wasn't me.

01:02:43.985 --> 01:02:45.617
Your guns are being inventoried

01:02:45.619 --> 01:02:47.052
and checked as we speak.

01:02:47.054 --> 01:02:51.157
It wasn't me. I keep
those guns for defense.

01:02:51.159 --> 01:02:53.960
And I seen the news. I
wasn't anywhere near all that.

01:02:53.961 --> 01:02:57.197
I had breakfast at Forman's this
morning, out with some buddies.

01:02:57.199 --> 01:02:58.530
All right?

01:02:58.532 --> 01:03:00.099
Receipt's in my wallet. You can check.

01:03:00.101 --> 01:03:01.668
Yeah. We'll check that.

01:03:01.670 --> 01:03:03.335
Yeah.

01:03:03.338 --> 01:03:05.003
It should take about five minutes.

01:03:05.005 --> 01:03:06.773
Yeah, right.

01:03:07.842 --> 01:03:11.244
Your story falls apart, though...

01:03:11.246 --> 01:03:12.978
I'm come back downstairs.

01:03:15.717 --> 01:03:18.918
Every fear you ever had
about cops is gonna come true.

01:03:18.920 --> 01:03:21.086
You'd love that, wouldn't you?

01:03:22.489 --> 01:03:24.523
You have no idea.

01:03:26.393 --> 01:03:28.927
Yeah.

01:03:28.929 --> 01:03:32.164
I was checking into
your... into your file.

01:03:32.166 --> 01:03:34.666
I saw a report about six months ago,

01:03:34.668 --> 01:03:37.536
you had a little
altercation at your house.

01:03:37.539 --> 01:03:39.606
Remember?

01:03:39.608 --> 01:03:41.306
I think your girlfriend's ex came over.

01:03:41.309 --> 01:03:43.175
He made threats, knocked
you around a little.

01:03:43.177 --> 01:03:45.010
Yeah, well... that's right.

01:03:45.012 --> 01:03:47.380
Who'd you call to clear it up?

01:03:57.958 --> 01:04:00.492
Yeah, I will. Yeah.

01:04:00.494 --> 01:04:03.028
Don't even bother. I need you back out.

01:04:03.030 --> 01:04:06.199
What? We just left Med.

01:04:06.201 --> 01:04:07.867
Yeah, Mike, I'm aware of your schedule.

01:04:07.869 --> 01:04:09.402
I need you back out.

01:04:10.704 --> 01:04:12.005
No.

01:04:12.007 --> 01:04:14.172
- Excuse me?
- I'm not going.

01:04:14.175 --> 01:04:16.608
I wanna talk to somebody
from peer support.

01:04:16.610 --> 01:04:19.711
Okay, okay, look. I
understand we're all grieving.

01:04:19.713 --> 01:04:22.148
And we will have time
for that. But right now,

01:04:22.150 --> 01:04:24.217
I need every available officer out there

01:04:24.219 --> 01:04:25.918
trying to find who
killed two of our own.

01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:27.586
I said no!

01:04:27.588 --> 01:04:28.887
Mike!

01:04:28.889 --> 01:04:30.088
- Don't do this now.
- No...

01:04:30.090 --> 01:04:31.456
You don't have to do
this right now, okay?

01:04:31.458 --> 01:04:34.092
I got 20 years, I'm vested.

01:04:34.094 --> 01:04:35.994
I will sign my PAR
papers, and I will get them

01:04:35.996 --> 01:04:37.730
to you tomorrow.

01:04:37.731 --> 01:04:40.199
No. No, no, no.

01:04:42.202 --> 01:04:43.969
I'm done.

01:04:55.550 --> 01:04:57.150
I'm sorry, guys.

01:05:01.121 --> 01:05:05.657
I'd rather be a living
beach bum in Tampa than...

01:05:05.659 --> 01:05:07.860
Than a dead cop in Chicago.

01:05:18.940 --> 01:05:21.641
Anyone else wanna quit?

01:05:21.643 --> 01:05:25.143
No? Me neither. Let's get back to work.

01:05:39.427 --> 01:05:40.592
My mom.

01:05:45.567 --> 01:05:47.632
Sarge.

01:05:47.635 --> 01:05:49.936
Receipt checks out.
Two waitresses confirm

01:05:49.938 --> 01:05:51.269
Dean was there for two hours.

01:05:51.271 --> 01:05:53.039
Restaurant's sending
over the security footage,

01:05:53.041 --> 01:05:55.942
but it's looking like he's not our guy.

01:05:55.943 --> 01:05:58.777
- Okay. Crime scene?
- Still processing it.

01:05:58.780 --> 01:06:01.179
We're running every pod,
sweeping every building

01:06:01.181 --> 01:06:03.583
and we've got knock-and-talks
going for two square miles.

01:06:03.585 --> 01:06:04.817
Well, we got another option.

01:06:04.818 --> 01:06:06.853
It's not gonna lift any spirits.

01:06:06.855 --> 01:06:09.222
Um, we checked with OEMC.

01:06:09.224 --> 01:06:11.556
Now, the jammers that
were used to interrupt

01:06:11.559 --> 01:06:14.726
our radios and our cell phones,
they're easy enough to buy.

01:06:14.728 --> 01:06:17.329
But for them to work
that well, you gotta know

01:06:17.331 --> 01:06:19.898
- police frequencies.
- The shooter was too prepared.

01:06:19.900 --> 01:06:22.402
You know, SUV was stolen ten months ago.

01:06:22.403 --> 01:06:23.835
It's methodical. Well-trained.

01:06:23.838 --> 01:06:25.271
Those two shots weren't easy.

01:06:27.307 --> 01:06:28.708
So you think we trained him.

01:06:28.710 --> 01:06:32.478
Yeah. We re-tracked
all fired employees.

01:06:32.480 --> 01:06:33.579
Five stood out.

01:06:33.581 --> 01:06:35.648
There's three that moved out of state.

01:06:35.650 --> 01:06:36.916
They're accounted for.

01:06:36.918 --> 01:06:39.085
One's in jail on an assault charge.

01:06:39.086 --> 01:06:42.121
And then, there's this guy.

01:06:42.123 --> 01:06:45.257
- Carl Dougherty. Son of...
- Mark Dougherty?

01:06:45.260 --> 01:06:46.726
A cop?

01:06:46.728 --> 01:06:48.260
Whoa.

01:06:48.262 --> 01:06:53.465
Mark Dougherty was killed
in the line of duty.

01:06:53.467 --> 01:06:55.902
The night he died at Chicago Med,

01:06:55.903 --> 01:06:58.003
the line of cops waiting
to pay their respects

01:06:58.005 --> 01:06:59.371
wrapped all the way around the place.

01:06:59.373 --> 01:07:02.175
Yeah, he was a solid
cop. Even a better man.

01:07:04.612 --> 01:07:08.313
Well, Carl tried to follow
in his dad's footsteps.

01:07:08.315 --> 01:07:10.715
He was kicked out of the
academy after four months

01:07:10.717 --> 01:07:12.385
for exhibiting erratic behavior.

01:07:12.387 --> 01:07:14.554
Wha... so, what? Then he
goes on a killing spree?

01:07:14.556 --> 01:07:16.355
He filed two complaints
with the Department.

01:07:16.356 --> 01:07:18.190
Last year for wrongful termination.

01:07:18.193 --> 01:07:20.326
Both went unanswered. CPIC
hasn't been tracking him

01:07:20.327 --> 01:07:22.994
for ten months because he shut
down all of his social media.

01:07:22.996 --> 01:07:27.166
But up until that point, he
had been posting vague threats.

01:07:27.168 --> 01:07:29.235
"They'll pay." "One day they'll pay."

01:07:29.237 --> 01:07:32.538
Carl was recently diagnosed
with delusional disorder.

01:07:32.539 --> 01:07:34.574
So we're waiting to
get those records now.

01:07:34.576 --> 01:07:36.708
We know where he's hanging his hat?

01:07:36.710 --> 01:07:38.610
He's with his mom, Cathy.

01:07:42.182 --> 01:07:43.815
Okay.

01:07:50.992 --> 01:07:54.494
Now I don't understand. Is Carl okay?

01:07:54.496 --> 01:07:56.094
- Is he in trouble?
- We need to know

01:07:56.097 --> 01:07:59.699
- where he is, ma'am.
- He wanted to try living alone.

01:07:59.701 --> 01:08:03.068
Just for a few months. The
hospital said it was okay.

01:08:03.070 --> 01:08:06.706
I found him a cheap rental
online with a roommate.

01:08:06.708 --> 01:08:09.074
- Just for a few months.
- Do you have that address?

01:08:09.077 --> 01:08:11.878
What is going on? Is
he really in trouble?

01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:14.179
Ma'am, we need his address.

01:08:18.417 --> 01:08:20.019
Chicago PD!

01:08:20.020 --> 01:08:21.354
Body!

01:08:25.126 --> 01:08:26.524
It's the roommate.

01:08:26.528 --> 01:08:27.693
- Clear!
- Clear!

01:08:27.694 --> 01:08:29.362
I gotta get this door.

01:08:29.363 --> 01:08:31.328
- Get that door.
- Ready.

01:08:31.332 --> 01:08:32.731
- Go.
- Yeah.

01:08:32.734 --> 01:08:33.832
Go, go, go!

01:08:43.609 --> 01:08:45.676
This is our cop killer.

01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:47.180
Man.

01:08:56.011 --> 01:08:57.979
Body found is Martin
Fuller. He's Carl's roommate.

01:08:57.981 --> 01:09:00.082
There was a 9mm at close range.

01:09:00.082 --> 01:09:02.350
M.E. believes he was
killed 36 hours ago,

01:09:02.353 --> 01:09:04.118
before the first officer was shot.

01:09:04.121 --> 01:09:07.354
Now, Ruzek said Carl's journals
spelled out his plans to the letter.

01:09:07.358 --> 01:09:08.689
Blueprints, escape routes.

01:09:08.692 --> 01:09:10.259
He's got everything down in detail.

01:09:10.261 --> 01:09:11.894
Yeah, except his endgame.

01:09:11.895 --> 01:09:14.162
It's referred to over a
dozen times in his books

01:09:14.163 --> 01:09:15.363
but never spelled out.

01:09:15.365 --> 01:09:16.698
Carl's picture's been sent to the news,

01:09:16.698 --> 01:09:18.867
and all call messages
are out all over the zone.

01:09:18.868 --> 01:09:20.636
Now we flagged his financials.

01:09:20.636 --> 01:09:23.037
Bank accounts, credit
cards. Guy's gone dark.

01:09:23.038 --> 01:09:25.140
His phone's off and he
hasn't used a single card

01:09:25.140 --> 01:09:26.207
in the last ten months.

01:09:26.210 --> 01:09:27.810
Well, he knows better.

01:09:27.810 --> 01:09:29.109
What about family?

01:09:29.113 --> 01:09:30.944
We've got cars sitting
at his mother's house.

01:09:30.948 --> 01:09:33.782
His aunt's in Edison Park,
and his mom's on her way in.

01:09:33.783 --> 01:09:35.384
Thanks for coming in, Dr. Charles.

01:09:35.386 --> 01:09:36.551
Of course.

01:09:36.554 --> 01:09:37.752
Look, I know you guys are up against it,

01:09:37.755 --> 01:09:39.188
so I'm just gonna start talking, okay?

01:09:39.189 --> 01:09:41.023
Please do.

01:09:41.024 --> 01:09:43.759
Based on Carl's age
and previous diagnosis,

01:09:43.761 --> 01:09:46.627
it appears that he is no
longer able to differentiate

01:09:46.630 --> 01:09:48.863
between illusion and reality.

01:09:48.865 --> 01:09:50.532
Records indicate that he was diagnosed

01:09:50.533 --> 01:09:53.469
with a delusional disorder
of the persecutory type.

01:09:53.470 --> 01:09:56.371
Meaning that even though
he appears organized,

01:09:56.372 --> 01:09:59.774
he is functioning under a
fixed but false set of beliefs.

01:09:59.777 --> 01:10:00.975
Based on?

01:10:00.978 --> 01:10:02.578
That's where it gets a little murky.

01:10:02.579 --> 01:10:04.378
Most people who suffer
from this disorder

01:10:04.381 --> 01:10:06.849
build a system on a
foundation of slights.

01:10:06.850 --> 01:10:08.449
Right? Some incredibly minor.

01:10:08.452 --> 01:10:10.185
The guy on the El who took your seat.

01:10:10.186 --> 01:10:11.686
Some not so small.

01:10:11.689 --> 01:10:13.921
The company that took your job away.

01:10:13.923 --> 01:10:18.159
These are all dramatically
amplified to this fellow, okay,

01:10:18.162 --> 01:10:22.497
representing those who
have neglected, maligned,

01:10:22.500 --> 01:10:24.632
even conspired against him, all right?

01:10:24.635 --> 01:10:25.734
Those who've caused him pain.

01:10:25.735 --> 01:10:27.435
Like the Chicago Police Department.

01:10:27.438 --> 01:10:29.537
His dad, his job. I
mean, it's highly possible

01:10:29.539 --> 01:10:32.073
that this guy thinks that the CPD

01:10:32.076 --> 01:10:33.509
is responsible for his suffering.

01:10:33.511 --> 01:10:37.479
How that might play into
his delusion is hard to say.

01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:39.113
He believes killing cops is righteous.

01:10:39.115 --> 01:10:40.615
It's likely.

01:10:42.319 --> 01:10:44.819
Mark raised him right.

01:10:44.822 --> 01:10:47.021
We both did.

01:10:47.024 --> 01:10:48.756
I remember Carl when he was a kid.

01:10:48.759 --> 01:10:50.725
From the FOP picnics.

01:10:50.728 --> 01:10:54.395
All Carl ever wanted to do
was make his father proud.

01:10:54.398 --> 01:10:57.466
He just...

01:10:57.467 --> 01:10:59.534
He just wasn't built the same.

01:10:59.537 --> 01:11:01.470
Look...

01:11:05.208 --> 01:11:07.141
I'm sorry you're having
to go through this.

01:11:07.144 --> 01:11:11.078
I mean, I know this is a lot
to grasp right now, Cathy.

01:11:11.081 --> 01:11:15.783
But... The last time you saw Carl...

01:11:15.786 --> 01:11:17.786
I mean, did he say anything?

01:11:17.787 --> 01:11:20.421
I mean, anything out of the ordinary?

01:11:20.423 --> 01:11:22.724
Like a plan. Maybe a person.

01:11:22.725 --> 01:11:24.292
He said he wanted to go home.

01:11:24.295 --> 01:11:25.560
- Okay.
- I told him,

01:11:25.563 --> 01:11:27.828
"sweetheart, you... You have a home.

01:11:27.831 --> 01:11:30.399
If you wanna move back, that's fine."

01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:35.337
He just shook his head and
said he wanted to go back home.

01:11:35.338 --> 01:11:37.471
How long have you been in
your home in Rogers park?

01:11:37.474 --> 01:11:39.207
Eight years.

01:11:39.210 --> 01:11:40.908
We moved there after mark died.

01:11:44.081 --> 01:11:45.314
Where did you live prior to that?

01:11:45.315 --> 01:11:46.715
Bridgeport.

01:11:48.685 --> 01:11:50.953
Is that the house Carl grew up in?

01:11:52.722 --> 01:11:54.256
Yes.

01:11:54.257 --> 01:11:56.425
We're gonna need that address.

01:12:01.599 --> 01:12:03.798
If you find him and he did this...

01:12:06.237 --> 01:12:07.836
Please don't kill him.

01:12:11.507 --> 01:12:13.542
Please.

01:12:26.590 --> 01:12:28.556
Remember the night we
lost Mark Dougherty?

01:12:28.559 --> 01:12:32.560
Yeah. Shut down the entire city.

01:12:32.563 --> 01:12:37.599
Tracked that son of a bitch who
shot him all the way to Gary.

01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:39.835
Got handcuffs on him.

01:12:39.837 --> 01:12:42.304
Had a confession before the sun came up.

01:12:42.305 --> 01:12:44.672
Yeah, it was good police work.

01:12:48.511 --> 01:12:53.314
All I remember about that
night was the crime scene.

01:12:53.317 --> 01:12:56.618
Mark Dougherty, two bullets in the head,

01:12:56.619 --> 01:12:59.320
bleeding out in the gangway.

01:12:59.323 --> 01:13:02.457
- Yeah.
- It's just like my dad.

01:13:06.130 --> 01:13:07.929
Hey, Sarge, we're ready to go.

01:13:29.386 --> 01:13:30.385
Hello.

01:13:30.386 --> 01:13:33.020
Is this Carl?

01:13:33.023 --> 01:13:35.256
<i>Yes.</i>

01:13:35.259 --> 01:13:37.958
Hey, Carl, this is Hank Voight

01:13:37.961 --> 01:13:39.927
<i>with the CPD.</i>

01:13:39.930 --> 01:13:42.396
<i>- Are you alone in the house?
- No.</i>

01:13:42.399 --> 01:13:44.332
I have hostages.

01:13:44.335 --> 01:13:46.801
I will kill them.

01:13:46.804 --> 01:13:49.136
Please call a hostage situation now.

01:13:49.139 --> 01:13:52.106
All right, I'm gonna do that.

01:13:52.109 --> 01:13:53.774
But I need you to talk to me first

01:13:53.777 --> 01:13:56.110
<i>so I know what it is I'm calling in.</i>

01:13:58.515 --> 01:14:00.247
Can you tell me who's inside?

01:14:00.250 --> 01:14:02.984
<i>- Are they safe?
- They're safe now.</i>

01:14:02.985 --> 01:14:04.485
Okay, good.

01:14:04.488 --> 01:14:06.188
We're gonna keep it that way.

01:14:15.733 --> 01:14:17.666
<i>Carl, what are we doing here?</i>

01:14:17.667 --> 01:14:19.368
You're not a hostage negotiator.

01:14:19.369 --> 01:14:21.770
No, no, I'm not.

01:14:21.771 --> 01:14:25.039
But... I can help.

01:14:25.042 --> 01:14:28.143
<i>Look, why don't you tell
me what it is you're after?</i>

01:14:28.145 --> 01:14:30.845
You're supposed to call in support.

01:14:30.847 --> 01:14:34.349
I need the dozen cars, the command post,

01:14:34.350 --> 01:14:36.818
the hostage negotiator.

01:14:36.819 --> 01:14:38.953
Well, that's all coming.

01:14:38.956 --> 01:14:42.090
I just thought, for right now,

01:14:42.091 --> 01:14:44.960
let's you and me talk about
how we're gonna end this.

01:14:52.836 --> 01:14:55.636
Carl, I knew your father.

01:14:55.639 --> 01:14:57.872
<i>He was a good man.</i>

01:14:57.875 --> 01:15:01.176
<i>Look, if you walk out that
door right now, hands raised,</i>

01:15:01.177 --> 01:15:04.011
<i>I can personally make
sure you won't be harmed.</i>

01:15:04.014 --> 01:15:05.881
Not harmed?

01:15:05.882 --> 01:15:08.483
It's too late for that.
You've already done too much.

01:15:08.484 --> 01:15:10.318
<i>- I know what you've been doing.
- Carl.</i>

01:15:10.319 --> 01:15:11.685
<i>I've seen the news. You just keep going.</i>

01:15:11.688 --> 01:15:13.822
- Look, take it easy, Carl.
- Where are they?

01:15:13.823 --> 01:15:14.823
Where are the rest of them?

01:15:14.824 --> 01:15:16.725
The cops should be here by now.

01:15:19.029 --> 01:15:21.563
Unless you didn't call them.

01:15:27.237 --> 01:15:30.905
<i>Carl. Carl, you there?</i>

01:16:01.677 --> 01:16:03.612
Carl, I need you to talk to me.

01:16:03.613 --> 01:16:06.015
<i>You all killed him.</i>

01:16:06.016 --> 01:16:10.152
You killed him. You put
a bullet in his chest.

01:16:10.154 --> 01:16:12.720
And then left.

01:16:12.722 --> 01:16:15.824
You scattered until there
was nothing there anymore.

01:16:15.827 --> 01:16:17.926
And it keeps going!

01:16:17.929 --> 01:16:19.595
Carl, we can get you help.

01:16:19.596 --> 01:16:21.963
<i>- We can move past all of this.
-  You're supposed to</i>

01:16:21.966 --> 01:16:23.431
call in support!

01:16:23.434 --> 01:16:26.868
I need the dozen cars, the command post,

01:16:26.871 --> 01:16:28.537
the hostage negotiator.

01:16:32.275 --> 01:16:34.009
He's got the whole place
rigged with explosives.

01:16:34.011 --> 01:16:36.979
He's trying to get as
many cops here as he can.

01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:47.569
All right, Carl. Let's
talk about your father.

01:16:47.570 --> 01:16:49.570
You killed him!

01:16:49.573 --> 01:16:51.073
I know what you're gonna do.

01:16:51.074 --> 01:16:53.274
This little girl in here, this mother,

01:16:53.277 --> 01:16:55.277
all the people outside, my family,

01:16:55.279 --> 01:16:57.045
you're gonna hurt every
single one of them.

01:16:57.046 --> 01:16:59.514
You're a cop! So you can hurt people.

01:16:59.515 --> 01:17:03.851
No, Carl. I didn't become
a cop to hurt anyone.

01:17:03.854 --> 01:17:06.154
The exact opposite.

01:17:07.890 --> 01:17:09.957
Listen to me.

01:17:11.729 --> 01:17:14.462
My father was a cop like yours.

01:17:14.465 --> 01:17:17.532
<i>And he died in the line
of duty, like yours.</i>

01:17:17.533 --> 01:17:22.503
<i>Look that... that can cast
a big shadow, believe me.</i>

01:17:24.140 --> 01:17:29.511
But... what I've done as a cop,

01:17:29.512 --> 01:17:31.145
and as a man...

01:17:34.385 --> 01:17:38.654
Is to try to make him proud.

01:17:38.655 --> 01:17:40.421
<i>You can do that right now, Carl.</i>

01:17:40.423 --> 01:17:42.791
<i>It is not too late.</i>

01:17:42.792 --> 01:17:45.260
<i>Just put the gun down
and walk out that door.</i>

01:17:45.261 --> 01:17:47.929
<i>Your dad will be proud of you.</i>

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:54.269
Carl.

01:17:54.270 --> 01:17:56.070
Think of your dad, Carl.

01:17:56.073 --> 01:17:57.773
No.

01:17:57.774 --> 01:17:59.608
<i>- Carl.
- No.</i>

01:17:59.609 --> 01:18:02.210
You're gonna kill all of them.

01:18:02.212 --> 01:18:04.880
<i>- I can't let you.
-  Carl.</i>

01:18:04.881 --> 01:18:07.248
I can't.

01:18:07.251 --> 01:18:09.051
I won't let you.

01:18:16.260 --> 01:18:17.559
Take it.

01:18:31.975 --> 01:18:34.376
It's okay. It's okay. All right.

01:18:34.377 --> 01:18:36.243
Let's get you guys out of here.

01:18:36.246 --> 01:18:38.380
Okay. All right, come on. Let's go.

01:18:49.726 --> 01:18:51.960
Come on, let's go!

01:20:47.411 --> 01:20:50.578
Say it ain't so, man.

01:20:50.581 --> 01:20:55.082
Yeah. It's time for the next chapter.

01:20:55.085 --> 01:20:57.319
I'm always gonna owe you, man.

01:20:57.320 --> 01:20:59.753
For what?

01:20:59.756 --> 01:21:02.122
You brought me into the unit.

01:21:02.125 --> 01:21:04.893
I just hope I did you proud.

01:21:04.895 --> 01:21:06.661
I brought you on because
you were dating my sister.

01:21:06.662 --> 01:21:07.996
I thought you were gonna be family.

01:21:07.997 --> 01:21:09.296
If I knew you were
gonna break up with her,

01:21:09.298 --> 01:21:11.065
I'd have stuck you at the
guard shack at headquarters.

01:21:12.536 --> 01:21:14.935
- Timing's everything.
- Ha.

01:21:18.708 --> 01:21:22.077
Knowing the cop you've become...

01:21:22.078 --> 01:21:25.613
Knowing that you're here...

01:21:25.615 --> 01:21:28.550
That made it easy for me to
take the investigator's job.

01:21:31.287 --> 01:21:34.655
Well, I appreciate it, man. Here.

01:21:34.658 --> 01:21:36.658
- Love you, bro.
- Love you, too.

01:21:36.659 --> 01:21:40.028
All right, let's go to
Molly's. Let's do it.

01:21:41.845 --> 01:21:45.947
Nice touch, Christopher.

01:21:45.948 --> 01:21:48.416
Tough day. For all of us.

01:21:59.729 --> 01:22:02.463
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:22:02.466 --> 01:22:04.532
How you holding up?

01:22:04.533 --> 01:22:07.135
Okay. Thank you.

01:22:07.136 --> 01:22:09.203
I heard your partner...
What's his name, Sorensen?

01:22:09.206 --> 01:22:11.005
- Yeah.
- That he turned his badge in.

01:22:11.006 --> 01:22:12.207
Yeah.

01:22:14.010 --> 01:22:15.310
He's not here to give his version,

01:22:15.311 --> 01:22:16.644
so I'm gonna hold off on mine.

01:22:16.645 --> 01:22:18.512
But yeah, he quit.

01:22:18.515 --> 01:22:20.648
Well, I got a spot open in Intelligence.

01:22:20.649 --> 01:22:21.882
Yes!

01:22:23.653 --> 01:22:26.488
I hope that's where you
were going with that.

01:22:26.489 --> 01:22:28.689
I'll see you upstairs Monday morning.

01:22:33.130 --> 01:22:35.363
- Lindsay.
- Yeah!

01:22:35.364 --> 01:22:38.298
Hey! Man.

01:22:41.938 --> 01:22:43.637
Man of the hour!

01:22:43.640 --> 01:22:45.273
- Hey!
- Ooh!

01:22:51.448 --> 01:22:52.514
Hey.

01:22:52.515 --> 01:22:54.716
Thanks. For everything.

01:22:54.717 --> 01:22:57.551
No, thank you, man. Thank you.

01:22:57.554 --> 01:22:59.253
Speech! Speech!

01:23:05.228 --> 01:23:08.061
It's hard to say good-bye.

01:23:08.064 --> 01:23:10.664
Especially on a day like this.

01:23:12.502 --> 01:23:14.168
But...

01:23:16.805 --> 01:23:20.007
Been an honor working with you all.

01:23:20.010 --> 01:23:22.777
Thank you.

01:23:22.779 --> 01:23:24.345
Cheers.

01:23:24.346 --> 01:23:26.581
- To the blue.
- To the blue.

01:23:44.967 --> 01:23:46.167
When you say you have an emergency,

01:23:46.168 --> 01:23:47.835
I really hope you mean it.

01:23:50.472 --> 01:23:54.542
Your dad is in town.

01:23:54.543 --> 01:23:56.344
And he wants to see you.
