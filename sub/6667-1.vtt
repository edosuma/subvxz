You can say "Prost".

17:35.555 --> 17:37.398
Cheers!

18:33.029 --> 18:36.329
Really? Can you do a jump, or, you know...?

18:38.200 --> 18:40.202
Time for his little show.

18:42.622 --> 18:45.592
It's cool. Wow!

18:45.750 --> 18:47.468
So good. You're a dancer?

18:47.627 --> 18:48.970
You can't do that!

18:49.211 --> 18:51.714
At last you've got
someone to impress!

18:52.340 --> 18:54.092
Now you've got someone!

18:54.925 --> 18:56.598
For your old school shit!

18:57.136 --> 18:59.059
Pistols? Got pistols on you?

18:59.347 --> 19:02.146
What's going on?
What? What?

19:02.433 --> 19:03.935
Quick question...

19:04.268 --> 19:06.111
Get lost.
- Boxer, back off.

19:06.228 --> 19:08.447
Boxer!
- Piss off!

19:08.522 --> 19:10.900
Fuck off, you pussies!

19:14.945 --> 19:17.994
Stop it, Boxer!

19:18.240 --> 19:19.617
Stop this shit!

19:19.992 --> 19:22.370
Back off. Everything's OK.

19:24.038 --> 19:25.665
Boxer, what's wrong with you?

19:25.790 --> 19:28.339
Please, man, it's a party!

19:28.584 --> 19:31.383
It's his birthday. Cut it out.

19:31.629 --> 19:33.222
Boxer, please!

19:34.924 --> 19:37.302
You know, they're stupid guys.

19:37.385 --> 19:40.309
Boxer! Beer!
- Yeah. Beer.

19:42.306 --> 19:44.980
Man, you're always causing trouble!

19:45.601 --> 19:47.319
Chill out, hey.

19:47.728 --> 19:50.197
Relax. It's the cops.

19:51.565 --> 19:52.782
Good evening!

19:52.858 --> 19:55.236
Have a slow dance with me for my birthday...

19:55.319 --> 19:57.196
Let's smoke a joint.
To peace! Peace!

19:57.405 --> 19:59.999
What are you going to do now?
Are you going to party?

20:00.157 --> 20:02.205
Smoke a joint. For peace!

20:02.326 --> 20:05.546
Sometimes I just enjoy the harmony, you know?

20:05.621 --> 20:07.419
Those sons of bitches!

20:07.623 --> 20:09.421
Let's smoke one here!

20:09.875 --> 20:13.175
They're coming back.
They're coming back. Shit.

20:13.337 --> 20:15.431
We're on a zebra crossing. We're fine.

20:16.173 --> 20:18.847
I have to go.
- Take your bike.

20:24.223 --> 20:27.443
It's actually legal,
but let's go anyway.

20:27.560 --> 20:29.358
Let's get out of here.

20:29.478 --> 20:32.448
Let's hit the roof, boys.
Let's hit the roof!

20:32.523 --> 20:35.993
I have to go, guys!
- Where you go? Where you go?

20:36.235 --> 20:38.954
I have to open the cafe now.

20:39.071 --> 20:43.417
We're going now to the...
We're going to the roof.

20:43.617 --> 20:47.838
We have our personal roof.
- A roof? A roof?

20:48.789 --> 20:51.292
We're going there now.
Come. I drive you to the roof.

20:51.459 --> 20:53.507
No, I drive you.
- No, I drive you.

20:53.711 --> 20:56.965
Come on!
- You can't. I'm too heavy.

20:57.173 --> 20:58.299
No, I can.

20:58.466 --> 21:00.184
Sister! You come with us?

21:00.259 --> 21:02.432
No ego trips, man.
- I'm not...

21:02.511 --> 21:04.479
You touched my ass.
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

21:04.597 --> 21:07.601
Come on!
- Sorry, I don't want to touch your ass...

21:07.725 --> 21:11.025
Say sorry! With the heart!

21:11.228 --> 21:12.525
Sorry.
- OK.

21:15.399 --> 21:16.651
I told you.

21:18.360 --> 21:20.408
Ah, you're stopping the bike!
- I never stopped...

21:20.529 --> 21:22.452
Come on, drive, you.

21:22.698 --> 21:24.621
That's West Berlin guys, huh?

21:24.950 --> 21:26.952
That's real Berlin guys.

21:27.036 --> 21:28.834
You've messed up my cigarette.

21:29.205 --> 21:30.707
Take this beer.

21:30.998 --> 21:33.842
Hey, guys. Don't break anything!

21:34.001 --> 21:37.801
I'm going ahead. See you later!
- Where to? Where to?

21:38.255 --> 21:40.428
Looking good, Sonne!

21:41.050 --> 21:43.894
I'm out of here!
I'm never coming back!

21:48.390 --> 21:51.439
See that? Escort party,
dude, escort party!

21:51.560 --> 21:54.063
Guys! Blinker! Come on!

26:08.984 --> 26:10.201
Sister!

26:14.198 --> 26:15.871
Shut the fuck up!

26:16.742 --> 26:17.584
Sister, please!

26:17.659 --> 26:18.876
She's screaming, man!

26:18.952 --> 26:20.204
Fucking great!

26:20.412 --> 26:22.039
Sister, please. Come!

26:23.707 --> 26:26.631
You're funny. You were like, "Shhh!"

26:27.336 --> 26:30.636
Sister, the people is a little bit crazy.
- You want to go to sleep now?

26:38.806 --> 26:40.808
Fuss, where are you?
- I'm coming!

26:40.974 --> 26:42.976
Talk louder, why don't you?

26:43.602 --> 26:48.700
Let's relax. Because the neighbours are assholes.
- Ah, OK.

26:51.777 --> 26:55.782
You come here always?
You come here always?

26:58.617 --> 27:02.963
We've been here since we was... one year old.

27:05.332 --> 27:11.089
All together?
- We was babies. We was jumping on each other...

27:13.173 --> 27:15.847
No. But yeah, it's our place.
- OK.

27:15.968 --> 27:18.972
Tell her why I'm famous. I'm famous!

27:22.099 --> 27:23.976
I'm famous.

27:28.188 --> 27:30.316
I'm not a faggot, man!

27:30.399 --> 27:34.120
He stole a truck when he was eleven years old.

27:34.403 --> 27:39.705
He stole a truck and he went
on a highway to Poland.

27:40.742 --> 27:43.120
That's true?
- Quit laughing.

27:43.287 --> 27:46.131
And you were famous for that?
- I was eleven!

27:46.290 --> 27:51.262
It was the news. There was an interview.
- Blinker was in the news, too.

27:51.503 --> 27:55.883
His picture was in the newspaper.
With the picture, you know?

27:57.176 --> 27:59.019
Don't talk so loud!

27:59.720 --> 28:01.267
I'm just saying"-

28:02.389 --> 28:07.862
Blinker used to steal
these pizza mopeds...

28:09.313 --> 28:11.190
He stole these pizza scooters.

28:11.356 --> 28:15.236
I don't stole it for the scooter.

28:15.402 --> 28:18.451
I stole it for my brothers,
these hungry motherfuckers!

28:18.572 --> 28:20.074
Definitely.

28:20.782 --> 28:22.784
For the pizza!

28:22.951 --> 28:27.502
Which one would like the calzone?
This one, "tonno"...

28:27.789 --> 28:32.795
...this one, vegetarian.
It's expensive, sister. It's really expensive.

28:35.130 --> 28:37.849
What's that?

28:38.050 --> 28:39.723
Shut the fuck up!

28:47.142 --> 28:49.941
I smashed a guy.
- What?

28:51.313 --> 28:55.784
I really hurt...
I hurt a guy very bad.

28:57.736 --> 29:00.660
But what's the relation with the tattoo?

29:02.407 --> 29:06.253
I'm not a bad guy. I just...
I did a bad thing, OK?

29:06.411 --> 29:11.212
Yeah, but...
You did this tattoo for that reason'?

29:11.833 --> 29:14.507
Because you did something bad?

29:15.170 --> 29:16.296
Who cares?

29:16.380 --> 29:18.508
He was in jail...

29:19.132 --> 29:23.433
You were in jail'?
- Yeah. Blinker visited him. Three times?

29:25.138 --> 29:30.145
Sister, I visit him three times.
I give him everything he want. What he want.

29:31.436 --> 29:34.565
He was really a good friend.
- How many times you...

29:34.731 --> 29:38.781
You smoke? You don't smoke,
then don't. I don't like it!

29:40.404 --> 29:43.533
I don't wanna get her hooked!
- Oh, you're so righteous.

29:43.699 --> 29:47.829
Don't think I'm a bad guy, OK?
It's over, the thing.

29:49.288 --> 29:51.256
Quit laughing, moron.
- I'm not laughing...

29:51.331 --> 29:53.925
I don't think so.

29:55.168 --> 29:56.715
Thanks, sister.

29:58.088 --> 30:03.094
Bro, I wasn't laughing about you.
It was something else.

30:07.514 --> 30:10.017
Sister, please, careful. It's danger.

30:10.267 --> 30:11.610
I'm OK.

30:15.981 --> 30:19.326
Sonne, dude, please.
- What?

30:19.985 --> 30:24.786
Woah! It's really high!
It's really high! It's like...

30:27.492 --> 30:32.168
Hey, come back. Come back to the chairs.
- Shut the fuck up! OK. Look.

30:33.248 --> 30:36.047
Sister! Don't do that shit!

30:40.547 --> 30:42.970
It's really scaring? It's very scaring?

30:44.009 --> 30:45.306
Come.

30:46.011 --> 30:47.809
Are you scared?
- Please.

30:47.929 --> 30:49.647
Are you scared?
- I'm never scared.

30:50.098 --> 30:53.272
Are you brave?
- Of course I am. Look at me.

30:53.393 --> 30:55.771
Look at me!
- Hey, man!

30:56.521 --> 30:58.615
Victoria, why are you doing this?

30:59.483 --> 31:01.156
Do you want to jump?

31:02.319 --> 31:03.662
No.

31:04.154 --> 31:06.828
I am quiet.
You shut the fuck up!

31:09.034 --> 31:11.287
Hey, come on. Hey! Really.

31:13.455 --> 31:16.675
Hey, come on. Please.
Please. Hallo.

31:17.626 --> 31:20.596
Now, come. Please come.

31:20.796 --> 31:25.302
Look, I can also do this?
But now, let's go.

31:31.556 --> 31:34.776
I have to go.
Yeah. I have to go.

31:34.935 --> 31:37.734
Why? Why you go?
- I have to open the cafe at 7...

31:37.896 --> 31:41.446
...and I need to sleep a little bit.
I'm tired. Tonight.

31:41.983 --> 31:46.864
Where is your cafe?
- That one. Look.

31:48.281 --> 31:52.252
It's not time enough to go home
and sleep there and come back again.

31:52.369 --> 31:56.169
OK, sorry.
- But, if you want, I can bring you there.

31:56.415 --> 31:59.419
Yeah?
- Yeah. Because you're not a good driver.

32:00.544 --> 32:03.218
OK.
- Yeah. I bring you.

32:05.757 --> 32:08.431
Hey guys, I go! I go!

32:09.344 --> 32:11.767
I have to work.
- Why?

32:12.514 --> 32:14.391
You don't work?

32:14.641 --> 32:16.518
You gonna take her home?

32:17.060 --> 32:20.109
Nice to meet you.
- Also, nice to meet you.

32:21.189 --> 32:23.191
Fuss, happy birthday!

32:23.733 --> 32:26.202
Why are you going now?
- Because I have to work!

32:26.278 --> 32:27.245
I'll see you.
- Where?

32:27.320 --> 32:28.742
You don't have to work?

32:28.989 --> 32:31.333
I'll just take her home.
- You're coming back?

32:31.408 --> 32:33.035
No ego trips, dude.
- It's not an ego trip, retard!

32:33.118 --> 32:36.292
Hey! Good guy!

32:37.622 --> 32:40.091
See you again.

32:45.464 --> 32:47.011
See you tomorrow.

32:48.175 --> 32:51.179
Goodbye, wankers!

32:51.303 --> 32:53.647
We'll wait for you!
- Yeah, wait!

32:54.264 --> 32:56.187
Such a Casanova!

33:18.955 --> 33:21.378
Did you like the roof?
- I like it a lot!

33:23.919 --> 33:28.846
It's a good place.
- Shh. Now we have to be very silent. Not like...

33:29.466 --> 33:30.342
Oh.

33:32.844 --> 33:36.439
Because nobody talks in Germany
in the elevator.

33:36.932 --> 33:38.605
It's forbidden.

33:39.643 --> 33:42.692
Come on.
- Shh! It's forbidden. I told you.

33:45.440 --> 33:48.819
Don't you want...
- Shh! I told you.

33:53.865 --> 33:57.369
I'm gonna break the rule.
I'm gonna break the rule!

33:58.662 --> 34:02.257
OK, now we can talk again.
After you.

34:13.260 --> 34:15.262
OK, I drive you.

34:16.179 --> 34:18.022
It's here, right?
- Yeah.

34:18.223 --> 34:20.601
Hey, wait, wait. One sip. Give me one sip.

34:31.319 --> 34:33.663
OK. Jump on it!

34:35.447 --> 34:37.121
I don't know if I can do that.

34:38.159 --> 34:40.581
Ready'? Wait, wait...

34:44.291 --> 34:46.668
You're from the circus, right?

34:46.960 --> 34:49.382
That's more scaring than the roof.

34:49.588 --> 34:53.138
I promise. You're a good driver or not?
- I am a good driver. You see?

34:54.801 --> 34:57.179
I drive slowly, look?
- Yeah.

35:02.934 --> 35:05.312
You don't seem German at all.

35:05.478 --> 35:06.775
We are real Berlin guys.

35:06.938 --> 35:11.034
There are many people just coming here
and think they are Berlin, but we are Berlin.

35:11.276 --> 35:13.779
We're real Berlin.
Multiculture, you know?

35:14.070 --> 35:17.040
So where's the cafe?
- Just straight on.

35:17.198 --> 35:20.247
I'm going to tell you. It's on the right.

35:20.327 --> 35:22.000
Are you nuts? This is a pavement!

35:22.203 --> 35:24.877
Relax. You know what time it is?

35:24.956 --> 35:30.338
What's he saying?
- He's telling me about, don't drive on... here.

35:31.046 --> 35:34.016
We cannot drive here?
- Nah, he's stupid. Whatever.

35:34.174 --> 35:37.098
He's just angry because he have no wife.
- OK.

35:38.928 --> 35:42.307
See the door?
- I see it.

35:43.892 --> 35:46.896
You see I'm a good driver.
- Yeah, you are.

35:50.398 --> 35:51.991
Thank you.

35:54.736 --> 35:58.411
It was... It was very nice to meet you.

36:00.075 --> 36:02.749
It was really nice to meet you too.

36:05.246 --> 36:09.422
We have to see another day.
- Yeah, let's see another day.

36:14.172 --> 36:15.799
Bye. It was fun.

36:15.882 --> 36:19.932
Because you're like that all the time.
You just give the hand. You do like this.

36:20.095 --> 36:24.145
No, no. I'm just, you know...
Ah, whatever.

36:25.934 --> 36:30.110
Maybe, I don't know if you have
to go back to the roof, but...

36:30.188 --> 36:35.241
...if you want to come inside and...
for a coffee...

36:36.361 --> 36:38.329
...or whatever...

36:38.488 --> 36:43.836
The problem is, the problem is really,
I don't drink coffee, you know?

36:44.035 --> 36:49.212
I'm just drinking cacao! You know cacao?
You know, you have to...

36:49.416 --> 36:54.798
You know what I mean? I'm a cacao guy.
- You're a cacao guy?

36:55.004 --> 36:57.257
I have cacao inside.
- Really? - Yeah.

36:57.382 --> 37:02.229
But I just like it, normally
I just like it cold. And really strong.

37:02.429 --> 37:07.276
Really? Like double cacao?
- Yeah, let's make a double cacao.

37:07.434 --> 37:10.529
OK. So come on.
- Yeah? OK.

37:10.729 --> 37:13.323
Wait, I help you. I help you.
- Yeah, please.

37:27.662 --> 37:30.290
Put it here?
- Yeah, anywhere.

37:32.167 --> 37:34.215
Yeah, it's alright.

37:38.339 --> 37:41.764
It's a nice hot... Hotel? Cafe!

37:46.014 --> 37:48.187
We don't have to whisper here.

37:48.391 --> 37:53.113
Yeah, sorry...
I was just on the roof.

37:53.313 --> 37:55.941
Me too...

37:56.566 --> 38:00.036
So, cold cacao.
- Yeah, cold cacao, please. Double!

38:00.195 --> 38:02.197
Double cacao for you.

38:03.698 --> 38:08.955
What do you... How much money
you get here? Per hour?

38:10.914 --> 38:14.964
Like, I don't know. Four Euros?
- Four Euros?

38:15.126 --> 38:18.881
Man, it's nothing! They just want... Four Euros?!
- Yeah.

38:19.881 --> 38:23.511
But you get tip and stuff?
- Yeah, sometimes.

38:25.261 --> 38:29.732
I should kill my boss.
- Yeah, you have to kill your boss, I think!

38:33.770 --> 38:38.071
You know I'm a professional piano player.
You know this?

38:38.858 --> 38:42.738
Really?
- Yeah, I am. - Please. I want to see.

38:43.029 --> 38:46.704
Wait! Like the car?
You have a car, and you have a shop?

38:46.783 --> 38:49.036
And now you're a piano player?

38:49.244 --> 38:51.918
Yeah, my uncle was...

38:52.705 --> 38:53.922
... Mozart.

38:55.124 --> 39:00.255
Yeah, really, it was...
an older uncle from me is Mozart.

39:00.547 --> 39:03.266
Yeah, really.
So it's just in my blood right now.

39:03.550 --> 39:05.552
So maybe I can show you something.
No problem.

39:05.635 --> 39:06.511
I want to see that.

39:06.594 --> 39:09.973
But my hands are a little bit cold.
- You have to do like this.

39:10.181 --> 39:13.560
Yeah, I know how to do this. I'm a professional.
- OK, sorry! Sorry!

39:13.810 --> 39:15.938
OK, don't give me tips.

39:19.941 --> 39:24.037
OK, maybe it's because I'm not into it
right now, but I show you something.

39:24.445 --> 39:28.450
Just with my eyes closed.
- OK.

39:33.997 --> 39:36.375
Thank you very much.
- So good!

39:36.499 --> 39:39.218
Your face was so deep in...
It was like...

39:39.460 --> 39:41.929
Yeah, because it was deep.
- OK.

39:47.343 --> 39:49.345
I know I'm good.
I know I'm good.

39:49.596 --> 39:52.725
Yeah, you're so good I think
I'm falling in love with you right now.

39:53.057 --> 39:56.482
Really? Same!

40:00.648 --> 40:04.744
But do you play an instrument?
- Yes. One.

40:05.153 --> 40:09.704
One? What kind of instrument?
- Guess what.

40:13.703 --> 40:15.705
There's so many...

40:18.541 --> 40:22.842
At the first time I thought
you are more a triangle guy?

40:22.962 --> 40:27.217
Really? I look like that?
- Yeah, you look like a little bit...

40:27.467 --> 40:32.018
But different. You put triangle
like this... like a

40:33.056 --> 40:38.278
And if you look like this now? How I look?
I look like a triangle girl also?

40:38.478 --> 40:43.780
But it's a compliment!
- That's a compliment? I think you should go out of my cafe right now.

40:44.609 --> 40:49.160
OK, now I know what you're playing.
- What?

40:52.283 --> 40:56.629
A drummer... No, no, not drummer. Yeah,
a drummer, but I think you are a drummer...

40:57.205 --> 41:02.712
You're from Madrid, right? You are
one of the best drummer from Real Madrid.

41:03.461 --> 41:08.308
From Real Madrid, you are in the first row, like 'You're Never Walk Alone'?
- OK.

41:09.592 --> 41:12.766
But it might be? You look like it also.
- No, no, please.

41:13.096 --> 41:16.896
No, no, for real. What do you play?
- I play this.

41:17.058 --> 41:20.733
You play piano?
- Yeah. I am the daughter of Mozart.

41:21.729 --> 41:24.232
You're not the daughter.
I should know you if...

41:24.440 --> 41:26.818
No, really'? You play piano?
- Yeah.

41:26.985 --> 41:28.828
You saw I'm really good in it.

41:28.945 --> 41:31.824
Yeah, and I was like "Woah!"
You should be my teacher!

41:31.948 --> 41:36.545
I can practice you everything, no problem.
Just give me time. It's expensive.

41:36.703 --> 41:37.704
That's the thing, you know?

41:37.787 --> 41:40.210
You're so expensive?
- I'm really expensive!

41:40.331 --> 41:42.254
OK, but I'm going to give you a cacao.
- OK. OK.

41:42.500 --> 41:47.097
So now just show me
what you have just learned already?

41:47.463 --> 41:51.184
Ah, come on...!
- And then... Please! Hey, come on.

41:51.467 --> 41:54.471
Come on, come on!
- I've also showed my skill.

41:55.722 --> 42:00.319
I just showed my skills already.
Now it's your turn.

42:00.643 --> 42:02.236
It's just fair, you know?

42:05.189 --> 42:09.444
OK, I take a chair, and...

42:09.777 --> 42:12.951
...then please show me some skills.

42:15.616 --> 42:19.166
I'll be friendly.
- OK. - I'll be friendly with you.

42:19.245 --> 42:23.375
Thank you.
- My pleasure.

42:27.587 --> 42:31.182
Just look at me?
You're going to be my muse now.

42:31.758 --> 42:35.683
I'm your muse. OK. I am.
What can I do?

42:35.803 --> 42:39.524
I don't know. Look at me.
- OK. I'll just...

45:08.247 --> 45:13.879
I never, ever... I never hear
something like this before. Really.

45:18.007 --> 45:23.434
Show me your hands.
It's like wonder hands.

45:23.721 --> 45:26.099
Really!
- They're just hands.

45:26.265 --> 45:28.313
No.

45:35.524 --> 45:37.618
What's the name of the song?

45:38.069 --> 45:40.413
It's "Mephisto Waltz". You know?

45:40.738 --> 45:42.706
Mephisto?
- Yes.

45:42.823 --> 45:46.873
Mephisto, he's like a devil, huh?

45:47.578 --> 45:51.003
Yeah, it's the devil.
- I like the devil.

45:51.123 --> 45:53.467
Yeah, me too.

45:58.756 --> 46:00.349
But one question. Really...

46:04.262 --> 46:06.685
Why you don't play...?
You have to play...

46:06.806 --> 46:09.855
Not why. You have to play in concert halls.

46:09.934 --> 46:12.858
You have to do something like this!

46:12.979 --> 46:16.984
That was so cool!
It was like you're telling a story.

46:17.066 --> 46:20.741
It was like... Cool, man!

46:22.280 --> 46:26.035
It's not cool.
- Wait, you have something here, on your mouth.

46:26.867 --> 46:30.167
I'm sorry. But it was nice.

46:30.413 --> 46:32.086
No, really. You have to play there.

46:35.626 --> 46:39.426
I've been... I've been...
I don't know the name, how you say that.

46:39.922 --> 46:43.051
I've been... in the conservatory, you know?

46:44.051 --> 46:45.268
I was in the conservatory...

46:45.386 --> 46:48.481
...and I cannot continue in the conservatory
because I'm not good enough.

46:48.931 --> 46:54.233
They said me just to finish my piano career
or something like that...

46:57.064 --> 46:59.158
Because they're stupid, or what?

46:59.984 --> 47:02.487
No, it's OK. I prefer that.
- No, really...

47:04.030 --> 47:08.331
Because it's amazing.
It's like, you know, I...

47:10.244 --> 47:13.123
No, it's not amazing...

47:14.832 --> 47:19.804
I don't know. I've been sixteen and a half years
practising playing the piano...

47:19.920 --> 47:23.265
every day, like seven hours every day.

47:24.091 --> 47:28.062
Seven is the maximum. You cannot play more
because you're gonna hurt your arms.

47:29.472 --> 47:32.601
And it's a really hard life,
because you have no...

47:33.351 --> 47:36.400
...you have no life. You have no friends.

47:36.479 --> 47:41.485
Well, the friends are like the other guys
that are in the conservatory...

47:41.942 --> 47:45.116
...but they are not your friends really.

47:45.237 --> 47:48.286
They're like your enemies.
- Yeah, I know what you mean.

47:48.949 --> 47:52.203
Because they are fighting for your dream too.

47:53.079 --> 47:55.423
But was it your dream... to play?

47:55.623 --> 47:57.591
Not any more.

47:58.334 --> 48:01.178
No. Because it's...
You are... You...

48:01.670 --> 48:04.844
You can became a bad...

48:05.383 --> 48:10.981
I don't know. I was just thinking, for my
friends, they should fail in their exams...

48:11.138 --> 48:16.611
...because then I would have, like,
more opportunities for me, and it was just...

48:17.144 --> 48:19.112
...because our teacher said to us that...

48:20.272 --> 48:24.448
...just the 90% of us, we are losing our time.

48:25.152 --> 48:27.905
It's really difficult to be...
- No. But I know...

48:28.364 --> 48:31.994
It's really difficult to became
a real pianist player.

48:32.535 --> 48:36.381
And it's better like this.
You know, when I was 12...

48:37.289 --> 48:41.920
... I can remember, I was like an old lady...

48:43.129 --> 48:45.223
...just playing always the fucking piano.

48:45.297 --> 48:47.140
Hey, chin up...

48:49.844 --> 48:52.142
Heads high.

48:52.346 --> 48:56.522
For me, I just want to tell you... wait...
it was wonderful, really.

48:57.017 --> 49:00.738
It was so...
One second. Wait.

49:00.855 --> 49:02.107
Yo, my man.

49:03.649 --> 49:06.323
I'm here, in the cafe.

49:10.990 --> 49:13.914
Why did he call?

49:14.994 --> 49:18.498
I'm in the cafe, dude!

49:18.998 --> 49:21.000
Man! At the...

49:21.125 --> 49:24.925
At the organic cafe.
What does he want?

49:25.754 --> 49:27.677
Yeah, what do you want?

49:27.798 --> 49:29.175
Hello?

49:35.097 --> 49:39.273
What?
- No. Everything's OK.

49:45.107 --> 49:49.658
But I'm glad to be here. In Berlin.
- That's good.

49:53.073 --> 49:57.123
What? What happens?

50:04.710 --> 50:08.260
I have to do Boxer a favour.
We have to go now to...

50:08.506 --> 50:11.305
...to do some work.

50:11.425 --> 50:15.055
Now you have to work with them?
- Yeah, I have to go. Yeah, yeah.

50:17.223 --> 50:20.693
But are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm OK. I'm just thinking.

50:23.521 --> 50:26.320
But it was really nice to meet you.

50:26.857 --> 50:30.532
I hope, I hope...
Let's see each other again.

50:30.694 --> 50:32.867
Yeah, I want to do that.

50:33.155 --> 50:38.207
Maybe I come to you...
Yeah, what about my cacao, by the way?

50:45.167 --> 50:48.546
Now... I just...

50:48.963 --> 50:53.264
<i>OK. Go. Go.</i>

50:56.804 --> 50:58.727
What's up?

50:58.973 --> 51:02.273
He called.
- Yeah, you said!

51:03.310 --> 51:06.063
Can't I just talk in peace?
- Let's go!

51:06.146 --> 51:08.899
What's going on?
Do we have to meet him?

51:09.191 --> 51:12.115
Of course we have to!
- Yes, but why now?

51:28.919 --> 51:31.013
So let's go!
- OK!

51:31.213 --> 51:34.012
OK, retard!
- Where are we going?

51:34.842 --> 51:38.142
Boxer, where?
- We're going now.

51:39.847 --> 51:43.477
We're coming, Boxer!
We're coming with you!

52:06.790 --> 52:10.715
I just wanted to say goodbye.
And not goodbye. It's 'til tomorrow.

52:13.797 --> 52:17.176
It was really nice.
- Yeah. For me too.

52:17.343 --> 52:21.644
Just come tomorrow for your cacao.
- I come tomorrow, but...

52:21.847 --> 52:24.441
...but not today tomorrow...
- OK.

52:24.558 --> 52:30.190
New car. You have a new car.
- We have a new car now, yeah.

52:36.362 --> 52:40.162
Where are you going with this car?
- We have to do something.

52:44.745 --> 52:46.543
Just leave me alone...

52:46.622 --> 52:48.920
I think Fuss is going to sleep in the car.

52:49.416 --> 52:52.386
I don't want to, but he does...

52:54.129 --> 52:57.599
Dude! What are you doing?

52:58.133 --> 52:59.635
Get on with it!

52:59.718 --> 53:02.221
I'll get in and shift across.

53:02.805 --> 53:06.275
Business people! Always a little bit crazy!
- Yeah, OK.

53:07.601 --> 53:08.443
Front seat?
OK!

53:08.519 --> 53:11.147
Bye!
- OK, let's go.

53:11.355 --> 53:13.107
Peace!
- Bye!

54:46.992 --> 54:50.246
Victoria. I'm sorry!

54:50.704 --> 54:52.206
Hey! Wait outside.

54:52.289 --> 54:53.882
I'm very sorry.
- What?

54:53.999 --> 54:55.626
Do you have a water or something?

54:56.585 --> 54:58.462
Don't puke here, you retard!

54:58.545 --> 55:00.798
Everything's cool.

55:02.925 --> 55:06.350
Water, please.
- I've got water!

55:10.182 --> 55:11.684
Have a drink.
Sit up.

55:11.767 --> 55:15.021
No, the machine is not open.
I have water.

55:16.688 --> 55:18.531
Fuss is really drunk.

55:18.774 --> 55:22.574
He's drunk. It's his birthday.
- I know. I know.

55:23.779 --> 55:26.828
Calm down, Fuss. Breathe deep.

55:26.907 --> 55:29.535
Dude, like this.

55:29.701 --> 55:32.329
Relax, everything's cool.

55:32.496 --> 55:34.624
Wake up, man!

55:35.290 --> 55:38.214
Maybe the cacao's for him.

55:38.502 --> 55:40.425
Get your shit together.
We've got ten minutes.

55:40.546 --> 55:43.140
He'll make it!

55:47.553 --> 55:49.555
Man! Just fuck it!

55:49.680 --> 55:52.650
Call him and tell him it's off! Fuck it!

55:52.808 --> 55:55.357
We can't!
- We don't have to do it tonight!

55:55.435 --> 55:57.563
He wants four of us!
- But not tonight!

55:57.688 --> 55:59.690
I gave him my word!

55:59.815 --> 56:02.193
Boys! Relax!
- Don't let me down!

56:02.401 --> 56:04.745
Don't let me down!
Get up, man!

56:04.903 --> 56:08.874
Boxer, three's enough!
He just wants us in and out...

56:09.408 --> 56:11.456
He doesn't want any stress!

56:11.535 --> 56:13.583
What happens? What's going on?

56:13.662 --> 56:14.788
Fuss isn't going to be any help.

56:14.955 --> 56:17.799
Just call him and postpone it!

56:18.041 --> 56:21.887
We can't postpone!
I owe him!

56:22.296 --> 56:24.173
You know what I mean!

56:25.424 --> 56:26.425
What happened?

56:26.592 --> 56:31.598
Let's just go, the three of us,
bang bang, and out!

56:31.889 --> 56:33.687
Right, Boxer?

56:33.932 --> 56:36.606
Three? Three guys! One driver!

56:36.894 --> 56:38.817
What don't you get?

56:38.896 --> 56:40.239
What happened?

56:42.816 --> 56:44.363
Tell me.

56:45.736 --> 56:48.740
Ask her to come along.
I don't care.

56:48.906 --> 56:51.659
Quick job, then back to the cafe.

56:51.909 --> 56:55.288
Ask her!
- Are you crazy? We just met!

56:55.621 --> 56:56.588
Just do it!

56:56.663 --> 56:59.883
Don't touch me, retard!
I hate that!

57:00.834 --> 57:02.552
Boxer, don't touch me!

57:02.628 --> 57:04.756
Ask her!
- I will. Shut the fuck up!

57:04.922 --> 57:06.094
Sonne, what happened?

57:06.214 --> 57:08.683
Come on, Fuss, let's go.
- What happened?

57:08.884 --> 57:11.433
Get out!
- Just fuck off!

57:11.678 --> 57:15.148
Hey, wait. No, no. It's OK.
Just let them go.

57:15.724 --> 57:17.647
You know...

57:23.732 --> 57:27.077
You don't have to do this.
Really, you don't have to do this, but...

57:28.737 --> 57:31.866
Boxer, he was in jail, yeah?

57:32.032 --> 57:35.662
And there was some guys
giving him protections, like...

57:36.828 --> 57:40.207
...the guys do him a favour...

57:40.499 --> 57:43.878
...now he have to do something for him.
For this guy.

57:44.086 --> 57:47.807
And now we have to go there with four guys...

57:47.965 --> 57:50.059
...and Fuss is completely...

57:50.133 --> 57:52.101
Man, fuck you! Wait.

57:52.177 --> 57:55.556
Piss off!
I'm asking her now!

57:56.014 --> 57:57.937
Then let's go!

58:02.104 --> 58:03.606
You know...?

58:04.272 --> 58:07.697
You know...?
You just have to...

58:09.861 --> 58:13.536
Please can you help us?
We just go there...

58:13.699 --> 58:16.703
...and after this bring you back
to the cafe no problem.

58:16.910 --> 58:19.629
We just need now help because...

58:19.788 --> 58:23.838
... Boxer is in trouble if not, you know.
- OK.

58:24.209 --> 58:28.635
And you need to be four?
- Yeah. I don't know why.

58:29.715 --> 58:32.468
I just drive you there and then I come back?

58:32.634 --> 58:36.514
We bring you back. We bring you back, no problem.
- OK.

58:36.722 --> 58:38.941
No problem.
- Yeah?

58:43.687 --> 58:47.817
It's something bad to do, or...?

58:51.695 --> 58:55.575
We've got five minutes.
Five fucking minutes.

59:00.996 --> 59:06.173
It's something not... After, maybe
it's something bad. But it's not about you.

59:06.543 --> 59:09.672
You know, we just go there and bring you back.

59:09.880 --> 59:13.180
Really, that's not bad for you. OK?

59:13.300 --> 59:17.771
Really. I swear. It's not bad for you.
- OK. I go. - Yeah?

59:29.649 --> 59:32.493
I was talking to a girl, you wanker.

59:32.944 --> 59:34.617
Are you stupid?
I was asking her!

59:34.905 --> 59:39.376
And don't talk to me like a retard!
I hate that!

59:39.576 --> 59:41.169
She's doing it!
- Just calm down.

59:41.328 --> 59:44.081
You need to calm down!
- You both need to calm down.

59:47.167 --> 59:50.011
Sister, you drive.
- Yeah, I drive.

59:50.295 --> 59:53.890
I'm the big driver!
Are you OK, right, guys?

59:54.257 --> 59:55.884
We are perfect!

59:56.009 --> 59:57.306
Let her drive!

59:59.137 --> 01:00:02.232
Let her drive. You don't have
a license, you stupid wanker!

01:00:03.391 --> 01:00:06.611
Do you know how to drive automatic?
- Yeah, of course!

01:00:07.229 --> 01:00:10.529
You can drive?
- Of course. I'm the fucking driver!

01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:16.155
You will see.
- Everything is cool, sister.

01:00:17.656 --> 01:00:19.283
What?

01:00:22.327 --> 01:00:24.750
I don't like it.
- How is that?

01:00:24.830 --> 01:00:27.049
He's such a moron.

01:00:33.797 --> 01:00:35.799
What happens with him?

01:00:41.555 --> 01:00:42.898
How do you say 'gerade aus'?

01:00:42.973 --> 01:00:44.145
Just straight, man.

01:00:44.266 --> 01:00:46.860
Straight?
- Just go.

01:00:47.769 --> 01:00:49.942
I'm gonna drive you, man.

01:00:50.063 --> 01:00:52.282
Now be nice to her, please!

01:00:59.281 --> 01:01:01.283
Where's Fuss?

01:01:01.366 --> 01:01:02.913
Fuss, brother?

01:01:03.118 --> 01:01:06.668
Can you all be quiet a moment?

01:01:06.746 --> 01:01:10.250
Fuss is knocked out, but it's OK.

01:01:16.381 --> 01:01:18.383
Quit laughing, man!

01:01:21.511 --> 01:01:23.934
What do you have to do there?

01:01:25.432 --> 01:01:27.526
It's just a meeting.

01:01:30.478 --> 01:01:32.401
Go right?
- Yes, right.

01:01:32.647 --> 01:01:35.241
Dude, she got it!
Just tell her she's safe, OK?

01:01:35.358 --> 01:01:40.740
Shut the fuck up.
I took care of that, wanker.

01:01:40.906 --> 01:01:44.035
Yeah, man, Boxer,
he really did.

01:01:49.414 --> 01:01:52.543
We'll just talk there, right?

01:01:52.834 --> 01:01:55.337
So what are we doing?
- No plan, dude!

01:01:55.420 --> 01:02:00.017
He wants to see we're ready.
- Exactly. It's a test!

01:02:00.091 --> 01:02:02.139
Thanks for your wisdom, Blinker!

01:02:02.219 --> 01:02:04.642
Calm the fuck down!

01:02:14.272 --> 01:02:18.277
Afterwards we're bringing
her straight back.

01:02:18.401 --> 01:02:23.498
I don't want...
I don't want to talk about it.

01:02:24.199 --> 01:02:26.952
Sonne, of course we'll bring her back!

01:02:27.744 --> 01:02:31.123
I don't want to talk about it.

01:02:47.222 --> 01:02:51.102
I'm fucked.
No: I'm good!

01:02:51.184 --> 01:02:56.238
We're meeting a real gangster.
That's interesting!

01:02:58.733 --> 01:03:00.986
Shut! The fuck! Up!

01:03:01.152 --> 01:03:05.032
Got it, Boxer.
Everything's cool.

01:03:05.991 --> 01:03:07.834
Give me another, please.

01:03:07.993 --> 01:03:10.496
Stop frightening the girl, retard!

01:03:10.578 --> 01:03:12.205
We're not frightening her.

01:03:16.918 --> 01:03:19.637
Where are we going?

01:03:19.838 --> 01:03:24.093
Where are you going, man?
With this shitty stolen car?

01:03:24.467 --> 01:03:25.719
Boxer, where are we going?

01:03:25.802 --> 01:03:30.649
Stop calling it a fucking stolen car.
It'll scare her.

01:03:30.890 --> 01:03:34.019
She doesn't understand,
so shut the fuck up.

01:03:38.857 --> 01:03:40.655
Sonne?
- What?

01:03:42.277 --> 01:03:43.904
Wait, wait, wait! Here.

01:03:44.070 --> 01:03:46.493
You're not afraid, are you?
- I'm not afraid.

01:03:46.781 --> 01:03:48.499
Put the car...

01:03:48.658 --> 01:03:50.911
Here inside?
- More, more, more...

01:03:52.662 --> 01:03:54.335
OK, stop.

01:03:56.166 --> 01:04:00.421
Sonne, we'll make it.
Give me five.

01:04:03.381 --> 01:04:05.930
Victoria, everything OK?

01:04:06.217 --> 01:04:08.436
It's OK, right?
- Yeah, it's OK.

01:04:08.845 --> 01:04:11.143
Are you OK, right?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:04:26.404 --> 01:04:28.577
OK, give me a light, please.

01:04:29.449 --> 01:04:30.541
Here, hang on.

01:04:45.632 --> 01:04:47.634
He has a gun.
- Just go.

01:05:05.693 --> 01:05:07.286
Shit.

01:05:11.408 --> 01:05:13.081
Shit!

01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:17.214
Do we wait inside?

01:05:20.041 --> 01:05:21.964
Are you fucking serious?

01:05:23.169 --> 01:05:25.217
Get out.

01:05:35.849 --> 01:05:38.102
I'll be in touch.

01:05:57.787 --> 01:06:00.131
These are your boys?
- Yes.

01:06:00.623 --> 01:06:01.875
Who's the bitch?

01:06:02.167 --> 01:06:04.886
Are you guys fucking her?
- The bitch is our driver.

01:06:05.128 --> 01:06:07.176
You don't say.
Get out.

01:06:14.095 --> 01:06:16.473
You're the driver?
Done this before?

01:06:16.764 --> 01:06:18.562
I don't speak German.

01:06:18.641 --> 01:06:21.440
What the fuck?
She doesn't speak German?

01:06:30.153 --> 01:06:31.496
Your problem.

01:06:32.113 --> 01:06:33.706
Let's get your tools.

01:06:48.379 --> 01:06:50.723
Hand them round.
- Are they loaded?

01:06:51.007 --> 01:06:53.681
Yes. You wanna throw candy?

01:06:54.719 --> 01:06:56.266
Come with me.

01:06:58.389 --> 01:07:00.107
The bitch, too.

01:07:04.270 --> 01:07:08.491
What's happening?
- Everything is OK. Just be quiet.

01:07:21.788 --> 01:07:27.045
This is the floor plan for a private bank,
Limburg & Co, Zimmerstrasse 26.

01:07:27.252 --> 01:07:31.428
There's 50.000 Euro in a small safe
for a customer, Mr Weigert.

01:07:31.673 --> 01:07:35.428
He'll collect the money at 7 am
to buy a vintage car.

01:07:35.593 --> 01:07:37.470
You'll be there already.

01:07:37.637 --> 01:07:40.186
Ten grand's for me.
The rest is for you.

01:07:45.895 --> 01:07:47.363
Right now?

01:07:48.314 --> 01:07:50.783
Yes. You got something better to do?

01:07:54.612 --> 01:07:56.285
Well...

01:08:02.787 --> 01:08:05.290
You don't have to.
I can't force you.

01:08:08.167 --> 01:08:10.636
Then we won't.
We won't do it.

01:08:10.837 --> 01:08:15.013
Boxer, back in jail you
enjoyed my protection.

01:08:15.174 --> 01:08:19.054
You owe me. Ten grand.
And I want that money.

01:08:20.430 --> 01:08:21.977
I'll get the money.

01:08:23.433 --> 01:08:28.314
You had no money for cigarettes
and now you'll find ten grand?

01:08:31.316 --> 01:08:33.488
Give me a week, OK?

01:08:34.234 --> 01:08:36.658
One week? OK.

01:08:37.113 --> 01:08:39.366
While you're getting the money,

01:08:39.448 --> 01:08:41.622
I'll keep the bitch.

01:08:46.497 --> 01:08:48.966
We'll do it.
We'll do it!

01:08:49.125 --> 01:08:52.550
Hey, we'll do it, OK?

01:08:52.837 --> 01:08:55.055
We'll do it, man!

01:09:01.888 --> 01:09:03.935
OK. Are you sure?
- Yes.

01:09:04.223 --> 01:09:06.442
Yes.
- Good.

01:09:06.725 --> 01:09:11.072
So, this is the entrance.
ATM, two security doors.

01:09:11.314 --> 01:09:12.861
Here's the counter.

01:09:12.939 --> 01:09:17.446
Six desks for the account managers.
Over here is the main target.

01:09:18.196 --> 01:09:21.917
Mrs Neumann sits here.
She's the bank manager.

01:09:22.033 --> 01:09:26.755
She has the alarm codes
and the combination for the small safe.

01:09:27.705 --> 01:09:29.877
Mr Weigert will collect the money at 7 am.

01:09:29.957 --> 01:09:33.837
Mrs Neumann and two clerks
will be in the bank then.

01:09:34.045 --> 01:09:37.219
The second clerk arrives
between 6:30 and 6:45.

01:09:37.298 --> 01:09:41.724
That's your target. She'll bring you
through the second security door.

01:09:42.511 --> 01:09:47.393
Alright? There's gloves and masks.
Show me what you've got.

01:09:50.853 --> 01:09:52.321
You stay here.

01:09:54.982 --> 01:09:56.655
She stays with me.
- Yes.

01:10:02.532 --> 01:10:04.705
I hate you.

01:10:06.703 --> 01:10:08.421
Gimme that shit!

01:10:16.087 --> 01:10:19.432
Take some gloves.
- Got 'em.

01:10:20.967 --> 01:10:22.969
We don't have much time.
- Yes!

01:10:23.386 --> 01:10:24.638
OK, boss.

01:10:30.226 --> 01:10:31.318
Shit!

01:10:35.273 --> 01:10:36.991
Should we start in the car?

01:10:37.233 --> 01:10:40.362
Whatever.
- Let's start inside.

01:10:45.116 --> 01:10:46.959
Wait, the gloves!

01:10:47.410 --> 01:10:49.287
Go!

01:10:50.788 --> 01:10:53.007
Wait, wait!
- Open the door!

01:10:53.583 --> 01:10:55.301
Open the door!
- Do it yourself!

01:10:55.710 --> 01:10:57.178
The lock, dude!

01:10:58.337 --> 01:10:59.634
Come on, come on!

01:11:02.675 --> 01:11:07.806
Let's go!
Everybody on the ground!

01:11:08.014 --> 01:11:11.063
Shut the fuck up!
- No one make a move!

01:11:11.225 --> 01:11:14.354
Down on the ground!

01:11:14.729 --> 01:11:17.152
Shut the fuck up!

01:11:17.482 --> 01:11:19.951
I said, down on the ground!

01:11:20.067 --> 01:11:23.367
Give me the fucking money!
Shut up, stay down!

01:11:23.446 --> 01:11:25.323
Give me the fucking money! Go!

01:11:25.656 --> 01:11:29.752
Give me the cash!
Go! Go! Go!

01:11:30.912 --> 01:11:33.631
OK, stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

01:11:35.249 --> 01:11:37.217
Good.
Who's the pressure guy?

01:11:37.418 --> 01:11:38.761
Who's putting on the pressure?

01:11:38.878 --> 01:11:40.880
Who's calling the shots?

01:11:41.172 --> 01:11:42.594
He calls the shots.

01:11:42.673 --> 01:11:46.644
Don't all shout at once.
Mrs Neuman needs clear instructions.

01:11:46.886 --> 01:11:49.605
When you enter...
- The door thing won't happen again.

01:11:49.847 --> 01:11:51.565
First leave the car...

01:11:51.641 --> 01:11:53.439
then go. Don't run!

01:11:53.518 --> 01:11:56.362
When you enter, two shots
to make things clear.

01:11:56.687 --> 01:11:57.939
What's the bank's name?

01:11:58.064 --> 01:11:59.407
Limburg.

01:11:59.565 --> 01:12:01.693
Limburg & Co, Zimmerstrasse 26.

01:12:01.818 --> 01:12:03.866
Bitch!
Zimmerstrasse 26!

01:12:08.074 --> 01:12:09.166
Good.

01:12:11.577 --> 01:12:12.829
Remember that.

01:12:19.168 --> 01:12:22.798
We bring you home now, yeah? To the cafe.
- I'm OK.

01:12:22.922 --> 01:12:25.345
Sorry.
- No. OK.

01:12:29.512 --> 01:12:31.480
Tilidin, cocaine.

01:12:31.722 --> 01:12:34.942
Take some.
It makes you confident and aggressive.

01:12:35.601 --> 01:12:38.480
If you're busted, you'll do less time.
- You first.

01:12:38.688 --> 01:12:41.111
Bitch, you too.

01:12:41.691 --> 01:12:46.117
Forget the silent alarm.
You'll be out in two minutes.

01:12:46.279 --> 01:12:48.702
A bit more, Boxer.

01:12:53.619 --> 01:12:56.668
Give me a bit more...
A little more.

01:12:56.747 --> 01:12:59.045
More, more. Another bit.

01:13:00.376 --> 01:13:01.548
Time to go.

01:13:01.627 --> 01:13:03.470
Give me some!

01:13:12.597 --> 01:13:18.320
Afterwards go home and stay put.
I'll be in touch. Have fun.

01:13:20.104 --> 01:13:21.526
Go!

01:14:30.049 --> 01:14:31.642
What is this shit?

01:14:36.681 --> 01:14:38.354
What is this shit?

01:14:39.141 --> 01:14:40.643
Boxer?

01:14:42.895 --> 01:14:45.398
Boxer, what the fuck is this shit, man?

01:14:46.732 --> 01:14:52.614
Victoria, I'm sorry, yeah. I'm very sorry.
- Don't worry. I'm OK. Don't care.

01:14:53.114 --> 01:14:55.833
So, we go to the cafe, yeah?

01:14:57.618 --> 01:15:02.840
Boxer. Man, I can't breathe!

01:15:03.791 --> 01:15:06.590
My heart!
I can't breathe!

01:15:06.669 --> 01:15:08.763
Stop the car!
- Don't stop the car!

01:15:08.879 --> 01:15:10.722
Don't stop the car!

01:15:11.924 --> 01:15:14.848
My heart! Stop the car!

01:15:20.766 --> 01:15:23.736
I stop the car!
- Don't stop the car! Don't stop the car!

01:15:25.187 --> 01:15:28.987
He's panicking! He's panicking!
- Stop the car! Stop the car!

01:15:31.277 --> 01:15:33.746
I'm not joking!
I'm not joking!

01:15:33.904 --> 01:15:36.783
I'm not joking!
Open the fucking door.

01:15:42.955 --> 01:15:46.004
Boxer, Boxer, I can't.

01:15:46.333 --> 01:15:49.132
Help. My heart.

01:15:49.295 --> 01:15:51.093
Calm the fuck down!

01:15:56.635 --> 01:15:59.730
Get up, man! Get up!

01:16:00.222 --> 01:16:03.396
I don't want to die!
I don't want to die!

01:16:03.601 --> 01:16:06.070
Get Up!

01:16:06.979 --> 01:16:08.777
Wait.

01:16:09.273 --> 01:16:13.699
It's OK. It's OK. It's OK.

01:16:20.785 --> 01:16:25.507
Breathe.
Breathe. Blinker, breathe.

01:16:34.423 --> 01:16:36.266
<i>Stop m.</i>

01:16:46.227 --> 01:16:48.446
I don't want to die.

01:16:58.739 --> 01:17:00.741
Guys, what's going on?

01:17:06.831 --> 01:17:08.959
Give me the fucking cigarette.

01:17:14.839 --> 01:17:16.591
I'll do it alone.

01:17:22.471 --> 01:17:24.724
I come with you. I drive you.

01:17:49.874 --> 01:17:53.424
Guys, for once:
everyone together.

01:17:54.003 --> 01:17:56.176
Come here.
Blinker, come here!

01:17:57.173 --> 01:17:58.516
Blinker, come here, man!

01:18:01.135 --> 01:18:02.808
No, let's go, let's go!

01:18:02.887 --> 01:18:05.310
Relax, for once.

01:18:20.196 --> 01:18:22.324
But we're taking her back first!

01:18:22.406 --> 01:18:26.411
Sonne, I want to go with you.

01:18:27.661 --> 01:18:28.913
Get up, man.

01:18:31.415 --> 01:18:34.419
OK, man. I'm coming.

01:19:03.530 --> 01:19:05.532
Straight on?
- No. Left.

01:19:49.576 --> 01:19:51.453
I'll take Mrs Neumann.

01:19:54.039 --> 01:19:56.963
I'll take Mrs Neumann...

01:19:58.419 --> 01:20:01.093
You keep the others covered.

01:20:01.463 --> 01:20:04.182
We're doing this.
We're going to make it, OK?

01:20:04.258 --> 01:20:09.185
Nice and easy. In and out. Two minutes.

01:20:10.014 --> 01:20:12.437
OK?
- Yes, man!

01:20:12.933 --> 01:20:14.856
OK, brother!
- Yeah?

01:21:03.192 --> 01:21:04.694
Go straight.

01:21:11.658 --> 01:21:14.081
It has to be there.

01:21:17.081 --> 01:21:18.708
Go. Go, go. Go.

01:21:26.256 --> 01:21:29.305
Go here. Stop right here.

01:21:29.426 --> 01:21:31.099
More. Go.

01:21:33.931 --> 01:21:36.525
Blinker, everything alright?
- What?

01:21:37.059 --> 01:21:42.862
Here turn the car, and you stop, OK.
And you wait. We come and we go.

01:21:43.816 --> 01:21:45.489
You turn around, OK?

01:21:45.567 --> 01:21:47.410
I already told her.

01:21:52.408 --> 01:21:55.252
Blinker, you're OK?
- Yes.

01:22:00.457 --> 01:22:04.678
Hey. Blinker.
- I'm calm, I'm calm, I'm calm...

01:22:11.427 --> 01:22:13.555
Is that her?

01:22:14.972 --> 01:22:16.599
Hey! Wait!

01:22:20.561 --> 01:22:22.484
Hey, that's her!

01:22:23.814 --> 01:22:26.317
Quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet!

01:22:37.327 --> 01:22:41.048
Down on the ground!
I said, get down on the ground!

01:24:01.954 --> 01:24:05.549
Go! Go! Go! Go!
Come on!

01:24:06.291 --> 01:24:10.262
The car, the car is not going on!
The car is not going on!

01:24:14.091 --> 01:24:18.221
Boxer! The car is not going on!
The car is not fucking going on! Come on!

01:24:19.555 --> 01:24:21.432
Man, just drive!

01:24:22.099 --> 01:24:23.271
Drive! Drive! Drive!

01:24:23.392 --> 01:24:26.646
Why don't you go?
Go! Go! Go!

01:24:31.775 --> 01:24:35.530
Drive slow! Hey! Slow! OK. Here!

01:24:36.572 --> 01:24:40.702
Left. Go left!

01:24:42.744 --> 01:24:43.916
Slow!

01:24:48.792 --> 01:24:52.672
Throw your jacket out!
Throw your fucking jacket away!

01:24:53.046 --> 01:24:55.048
Throw it out!
Throw it out!

01:24:55.465 --> 01:24:57.718
Throw everything out!
Throw everything out!

01:24:59.177 --> 01:25:02.898
OK, now go right! Here! Here!
Right! Go here!

01:25:07.102 --> 01:25:08.103
Calm down.

01:25:15.068 --> 01:25:17.491
No, no! Go back, go back! Go back.

01:25:17.738 --> 01:25:20.912
What the fuck?
- Go back, sister. Go back. Go back.

01:25:21.033 --> 01:25:23.252
Relax, please!

01:25:23.327 --> 01:25:26.251
Calm down, OK'? Calm down.

01:25:28.957 --> 01:25:30.550
Calm down! Calm down!

01:25:38.300 --> 01:25:40.894
Sister, you go back.
- Hey, calm down!

01:25:41.053 --> 01:25:43.431
Just think! Where are we going?

01:25:44.598 --> 01:25:48.353
We've got to get off the streets!

01:25:52.272 --> 01:25:54.070
Go safely, sister.

01:25:57.694 --> 01:26:00.243
Right!
- Go here to the right!

01:26:04.284 --> 01:26:07.538
Let's get out of here!
- Hide! Get down!

01:26:15.087 --> 01:26:18.216
Hey, now. Here right. Here. Here.

01:26:29.142 --> 01:26:32.772
Go here. Go in here.
Let's hide the car.

01:26:38.860 --> 01:26:42.364
Behind this, OK?
Go, go, go. Behind this.

01:26:49.204 --> 01:26:51.957
Stop the car.
- Stop you the car!

01:27:14.771 --> 01:27:16.990
Everything was OK?

01:27:20.485 --> 01:27:22.203
Boxer, you whore.

01:27:25.323 --> 01:27:28.418
50.000 Euros!

01:27:30.328 --> 01:27:32.626
A pharmacy bag.

01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:48.397
That was some sick shit.
Show me: how much we got?

01:27:52.601 --> 01:27:55.480
Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm OK.

01:27:56.313 --> 01:27:59.988
Hey, guys!
I just want to say I love you.

01:28:00.484 --> 01:28:04.284
Boys, let's get going.
Grab your fucking guns!

01:28:06.656 --> 01:28:10.877
Guys! Sonne! Sonne!

01:28:11.203 --> 01:28:14.047
Grab all the shit.
Just take everything.

01:28:14.247 --> 01:28:17.467
Grab the gun and don't leave a trace.

01:28:18.335 --> 01:28:19.962
Wipe them off!

01:28:42.567 --> 01:28:43.989
Let's go party, man!

01:28:46.321 --> 01:28:47.322
We do it!

01:28:47.447 --> 01:28:49.074
Let's go party!

01:28:49.324 --> 01:28:51.668
Wait, wait!
- Alright, man.

01:28:53.078 --> 01:28:57.379
Now, I think... we need a drink!

01:28:57.999 --> 01:29:00.468
I think so, yeah.
- You think also? - Yeah!

01:29:00.544 --> 01:29:02.717
Throw away this shit.

01:29:05.549 --> 01:29:07.802
My jacket!
- Throw it away, dude.

01:29:07.926 --> 01:29:10.099
Hey, man!
- Fuck it.

01:29:34.870 --> 01:29:36.998
You're so fucking crazy!

01:29:38.707 --> 01:29:42.382
A bit of pocket money?

01:29:44.671 --> 01:29:48.016
Give me some pocket money.

01:29:49.676 --> 01:29:51.223
Let me see!

01:29:51.428 --> 01:29:54.056
You're so fucking crazy.

01:29:56.474 --> 01:29:57.817
Evening.

01:29:57.893 --> 01:30:02.239
Sister, where you go?
- I don't know where I'm going, what I'm doing!

01:30:04.733 --> 01:30:06.861
We go partying'?

01:30:12.574 --> 01:30:15.453
Get going!

01:30:20.373 --> 01:30:23.092
Six Euros!

01:30:23.501 --> 01:30:27.927
It's us again!
Here's one hundred. And two hundred.

01:30:28.131 --> 01:30:32.932
Good evening!
- Remember? You wouldn't let us in!

01:30:35.388 --> 01:30:39.268
Here you are.
Take it, take it, take it, brother.

01:30:43.563 --> 01:30:47.238
Give me a whisky, dude!
Just give me whisky, please.

01:30:47.692 --> 01:30:50.946
Give me everything you've got.
- Give me two whiskies.

01:35:02.238 --> 01:35:08.211
I told you, the club belongs to me!

01:35:30.058 --> 01:35:31.856
It's over now.

01:35:31.935 --> 01:35:33.482
What do you mean, it's over?

01:35:33.603 --> 01:35:38.655
Of course it's over. That's why we're partying.

01:35:38.733 --> 01:35:41.327
Sorry, it happens sometimes.

01:35:41.569 --> 01:35:43.037
Our day is over!

01:35:43.112 --> 01:35:45.490
Yeah! These guys? These guys? Fire!
These guys? Fire!

01:35:45.573 --> 01:35:48.167
Come on, get on with it!
This isn't your kind of place.

01:35:48.284 --> 01:35:51.037
What's up with you?
- Come on! Off you go!

01:35:53.248 --> 01:35:56.127
We're dressed and ready to go!

01:35:56.334 --> 01:35:58.962
Dressed and ready to go!

01:35:59.462 --> 01:36:02.090
Let's go!

01:36:08.972 --> 01:36:10.269
Get out!

01:36:12.725 --> 01:36:14.773
Let her down, man.

01:36:16.980 --> 01:36:20.109
I don't want to go!
I don't want to go

01:36:20.858 --> 01:36:23.987
The place is ours!
- We go, we go, we go!

01:36:40.336 --> 01:36:42.714
Boxer, I'm looking at your ass!

01:36:43.006 --> 01:36:45.600
Hey, man, don't push it!

01:36:52.932 --> 01:36:55.105
Don't touch my hair, please!

01:36:56.519 --> 01:36:58.942
What are you doing?
You want to fight me?

01:36:59.105 --> 01:37:01.824
You want to fight with me?
I can kick your ass, OK?

01:37:01.941 --> 01:37:03.693
Hang on a second.

01:37:03.818 --> 01:37:05.820
Did you see that?
Give me a kiss.

01:37:19.876 --> 01:37:23.471
We go party!
We go party!

01:37:23.921 --> 01:37:26.390
We go party!
We go to the roof!

01:37:26.507 --> 01:37:27.929
Blinker, brother!

01:37:28.009 --> 01:37:32.059
Let's check what Fuss is doing,
you stupid morons!

01:37:32.347 --> 01:37:35.817
Oh, my God! Fuss!
He's still in the car!

01:37:40.897 --> 01:37:44.026
I totally forgot about him!

01:37:44.108 --> 01:37:46.782
I completely forgot him!

01:37:49.238 --> 01:37:52.242
Hey, Blinker, you retard!

01:37:52.784 --> 01:37:54.502
Man! Blinker! Man!

01:38:12.387 --> 01:38:14.435
Just run slowly!
- OK, OK, OK.

01:38:14.597 --> 01:38:18.397
Fuck your shoes.
- Don't panic. Act normal!

01:38:34.492 --> 01:38:36.290
Blinker, hey!

01:38:36.452 --> 01:38:37.544
Blinker! Come on!

01:38:37.662 --> 01:38:39.664
I'm coming. I'm coming.

01:38:39.831 --> 01:38:42.425
Stay calm! Stay calm!

01:38:47.380 --> 01:38:48.222
We'll make it!

01:38:48.297 --> 01:38:50.391
Pull your fucking trousers up, man!

01:38:51.843 --> 01:38:53.937
Where did they come from?

01:38:58.182 --> 01:39:02.153
What do we have to do now?
- Just go.

01:39:02.979 --> 01:39:04.731
We fucked up!
Really fucked up!

01:39:04.856 --> 01:39:06.608
We go to the roof now?
- Yeah.

01:39:28.963 --> 01:39:32.388
Cops.
I swear on my mother's grave!

01:39:33.009 --> 01:39:35.933
Cops!
- Wait! Stop shouting!

01:39:39.098 --> 01:39:42.147
What? What? What?

01:39:42.643 --> 01:39:44.520
Wait! Shit!

01:39:46.022 --> 01:39:47.274
Wait!

01:39:48.566 --> 01:39:51.410
Go! Go, man!
Move your fucking ass!

01:39:58.117 --> 01:39:59.994
Don't run!

01:40:13.049 --> 01:40:14.346
Go! Run! Run!

01:40:16.844 --> 01:40:17.970
Go left!

01:40:18.930 --> 01:40:20.056
Left, man!

01:40:23.184 --> 01:40:23.935
Fuck you!

01:40:24.018 --> 01:40:27.067
Police! Freeze! Stop!
Throw your guns down!

01:40:27.188 --> 01:40:28.235
Fuck off!

01:40:30.483 --> 01:40:32.577
Stay where you are!

01:40:33.319 --> 01:40:36.072
Drop your weapons!

01:40:38.157 --> 01:40:41.286
Stay where you are!
Drop the gun!

01:40:41.661 --> 01:40:42.378
Freeze!

01:40:42.495 --> 01:40:43.246
Blinker!

01:40:43.746 --> 01:40:44.747
Sonne!

01:40:46.332 --> 01:40:48.005
Fuck you, you wanker!

01:40:48.084 --> 01:40:50.803
Put your weapons down
and come out now!

01:40:52.004 --> 01:40:53.802
You bastards!

01:40:57.552 --> 01:40:59.225
Sonne!

01:41:00.680 --> 01:41:03.559
Come out!
You don't stand a chance.

01:41:03.641 --> 01:41:05.735
Come out with your hands up!

01:41:08.563 --> 01:41:09.735
Stop!

01:41:09.814 --> 01:41:11.282
Stay where you are!

01:41:12.400 --> 01:41:13.743
Leave the money!

01:41:13.943 --> 01:41:16.071
Come on!
- Drop the gun!

01:41:16.862 --> 01:41:19.115
Drop the gun, or I'll shoot!

01:41:23.744 --> 01:41:25.917
Boxer, come here!

01:41:26.872 --> 01:41:28.215
<i>Come on!</i>

01:41:35.298 --> 01:41:36.094
Where? Where?

01:41:36.173 --> 01:41:37.516
There's no way out!

01:41:37.967 --> 01:41:39.685
Where, man? Where?

01:41:42.513 --> 01:41:43.480
Sonne!

01:41:45.558 --> 01:41:46.605
Help me!

01:41:47.393 --> 01:41:48.610
Fuck off!

01:41:49.186 --> 01:41:51.359
Fuck off!

01:41:52.231 --> 01:41:54.484
Throw your guns away!

01:41:58.904 --> 01:42:02.374
Put down your guns!
Come out with your hands up!

01:42:03.117 --> 01:42:05.620
Take the money!
- You're coming with us!

01:42:05.828 --> 01:42:09.332
You're coming with us!
You're coming with us!

01:42:09.540 --> 01:42:11.588
Just get the fuck out of here!

01:42:18.049 --> 01:42:19.141
Go! Go!

01:42:20.217 --> 01:42:21.810
Go! Go, go, go, go, go!

01:42:25.848 --> 01:42:27.475
Come. Come.
Go. Go.

01:42:46.035 --> 01:42:48.413
They're cops! They're cops.

01:42:49.914 --> 01:42:51.666
Upstairs. Upstairs.

01:42:52.708 --> 01:42:54.176
Here are the cops.

01:42:54.835 --> 01:42:56.462
Come here. Come, come, come, come.

01:43:03.386 --> 01:43:05.263
Don't look at me.
Turn around.

01:43:05.388 --> 01:43:07.186
Where do you live?
- Upstairs. Upstairs!

01:43:07.306 --> 01:43:10.310
Where do you live!
- Upstairs, one floor up!

01:43:10.393 --> 01:43:12.111
Let us in!

01:43:12.395 --> 01:43:15.490
Move your ass! Go, go, go!
- OK, OK!

01:43:17.650 --> 01:43:20.244
Hurry "P!

01:43:20.319 --> 01:43:23.823
On the floor!
Shut the fuck up! In the living room!

01:43:26.826 --> 01:43:28.169
You too!

01:43:31.288 --> 01:43:33.916
Shut the fuck up!
Stay on the ground!

01:43:34.792 --> 01:43:36.794
Stay on the ground!
Don't look at me!

01:43:36.877 --> 01:43:39.300
Don't look at me!
OK'?

01:43:39.422 --> 01:43:42.676
Shut the fuck up!
Shut...

01:43:55.896 --> 01:43:59.400
Why'd you let me
into your shitty flat with a baby, man?

01:43:59.483 --> 01:44:00.951
I don't know...

01:44:01.026 --> 01:44:05.998
Are you stupid?
You can't let me in when there's a baby here!

01:44:11.829 --> 01:44:14.252
How stupid are you?

01:44:15.458 --> 01:44:16.960
How stupid are you, man?

01:44:21.213 --> 01:44:22.840
Shut the fuck up.

01:44:24.967 --> 01:44:27.470
Shut the fuck up.

01:44:42.401 --> 01:44:43.869
It's over.

01:44:46.822 --> 01:44:48.119
It's over.

01:44:54.580 --> 01:44:58.426
So stupid. It was stupid.

01:45:00.669 --> 01:45:04.390
Shut the fuck up!
Sonne, shut the fuck up.

01:45:14.058 --> 01:45:16.607
Well, we're finished.

01:45:19.563 --> 01:45:23.909
Attention, residents! This is the police!

01:45:24.068 --> 01:45:28.494
Please stay in your homes.
Keep your doors closed.

01:45:28.656 --> 01:45:32.706
Don't let anyone in!

01:45:32.785 --> 01:45:37.336
We will inform you once
the situation is under control.

01:45:37.498 --> 01:45:42.847
Attention, residents! This is the police!
Secure your doors and windows.

01:46:06.151 --> 01:46:09.451
Listen. Listen to me.

01:46:11.448 --> 01:46:14.372
I'm going to take your baby.
Listen to me!

01:46:14.451 --> 01:46:17.921
No!

01:46:18.080 --> 01:46:20.754
Come. Listen to me.

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:22.001
Listen to me.

01:46:22.293 --> 01:46:24.387
Look at me!
- Not my baby.

01:46:24.545 --> 01:46:27.924
We are good people.
We need your help, now. Right now!

01:46:28.007 --> 01:46:29.350
Not my baby!

01:46:29.425 --> 01:46:31.098
Look at me!

01:46:32.303 --> 01:46:34.180
Your baby's going to be OK!

01:46:34.346 --> 01:46:36.974
Shut the fuck up! Shut the fuck up!
Shut the fuck up!

01:46:38.392 --> 01:46:41.020
Shut the fuck up! Please! Please!

01:46:41.979 --> 01:46:43.777
Listen to me!

01:46:45.691 --> 01:46:47.944
I'm going to take the baby
because we need your help...

01:46:48.152 --> 01:46:51.031
...and I'm going to leave your baby there!

01:46:53.073 --> 01:46:57.624
Put your clothes on! Put your clothes on!
Come on! Come on!

01:47:04.251 --> 01:47:07.050
OK. Listen to me. OK?

01:47:07.630 --> 01:47:10.008
Your baby's going to be...
Hey, hey. Listen.

01:47:10.758 --> 01:47:13.807
Your baby's going to be OK. I promise.

01:47:13.928 --> 01:47:16.397
We need your help.
We just need to go out.

01:47:16.513 --> 01:47:20.609
Your baby's going to be in that store
in five minutes.

01:47:20.726 --> 01:47:24.981
I promise. I promise to you.
We need just your help, please.

01:47:26.649 --> 01:47:30.119
Listen up!
Give us the baby!

01:47:31.403 --> 01:47:33.576
Give us...!
- No, no! Please, Sonne! No!

01:47:33.697 --> 01:47:35.916
OK, wait!

01:47:39.995 --> 01:47:42.748
Take the baby! Take the baby!

01:47:55.928 --> 01:47:57.771
Yeah, come on!
- I've got it!

01:47:57.930 --> 01:47:59.898
Put it here! Put it here! Put it here!

01:48:01.225 --> 01:48:02.943
Where's the money?

01:48:06.814 --> 01:48:08.157
Everything's OK.

01:48:08.232 --> 01:48:09.905
It's going to be OK.

01:48:12.861 --> 01:48:17.332
Hey, it's OK.
Lie down! Lie down!

01:48:17.533 --> 01:48:18.580
Everything's OK.
No, no!

01:48:18.742 --> 01:48:20.619
Sonne, give me the fucking gun.
Give me the fucking gun!

01:48:20.744 --> 01:48:22.337
Give me the fucking gun!

01:48:22.454 --> 01:48:25.253
Shut the fuck up!
Shut your fucking mouth!

01:48:25.332 --> 01:48:29.257
He's going to be OK.
He's going to be OK, I promise.

01:48:37.761 --> 01:48:39.183
Go.

01:48:57.239 --> 01:48:58.115
Police!

01:48:58.490 --> 01:49:00.959
Stay where you are!
Hands up.

01:49:01.869 --> 01:49:03.746
Take a step down.

01:49:04.830 --> 01:49:06.548
Stop, stop.

01:49:06.749 --> 01:49:11.505
Sparrowhawk to HQ?
I've got two individuals in the hall.

01:49:12.629 --> 01:49:14.597
Two youths...

01:49:15.090 --> 01:49:19.766
No. HQ, I need a
situation report now!

01:49:21.430 --> 01:49:25.651
I've got two individuals, mid twenties.
- We live here.

01:49:25.851 --> 01:49:29.025
They have a baby.
- We live here.

01:49:30.481 --> 01:49:32.529
Give me a description!

01:49:32.941 --> 01:49:36.571
They've got colourful clothing and a baby.

01:49:37.488 --> 01:49:41.163
Come down here, please.
- We live here.

01:49:41.492 --> 01:49:45.213
What happened?
What happened?

01:49:48.832 --> 01:49:50.880
Secure upstairs.
- What happened?

01:49:50.959 --> 01:49:53.803
Stay here.
You'll be picked up.

01:49:53.879 --> 01:49:57.429
My colleagues will pick you up.
Just stay here.

01:50:20.030 --> 01:50:24.080
We have to go here.
There's policemen everywhere. Yeah.

01:50:24.201 --> 01:50:27.421
Yeah, but come, come.

01:50:33.544 --> 01:50:35.638
They told us to get out fast!

01:50:35.838 --> 01:50:37.556
Move around the corner.

01:50:37.673 --> 01:50:38.925
Yes.

01:50:39.007 --> 01:50:41.180
Take it. Take it. Take it.

01:50:52.729 --> 01:50:55.323
Where's the... Where's the gun?
- Here.

01:51:00.571 --> 01:51:01.572
Shit!

01:51:33.353 --> 01:51:35.196
Morning.
- Good morning.

01:51:35.731 --> 01:51:37.278
Good morning.

01:51:37.774 --> 01:51:39.367
Greetings, sir.
- Hello!

01:51:39.443 --> 01:51:42.993
Straight on for now.
- OK.

01:51:44.656 --> 01:51:47.125
Just straight on...

01:51:47.367 --> 01:51:50.462
and then left...

01:51:57.544 --> 01:52:00.923
Your first fare?
- No, my last.

01:52:01.006 --> 01:52:02.599
Yeah?
- Left here?

01:52:02.716 --> 01:52:04.935
Yes, just go left.

01:52:05.677 --> 01:52:07.805
You got it.

01:52:23.946 --> 01:52:26.745
Can you just take us...?

01:52:27.950 --> 01:52:30.829
Just take us to a hotel.

01:52:31.119 --> 01:52:35.295
What kind? Fifty or five hundred Euro?
- Doesn't matter.

01:52:35.374 --> 01:52:37.593
Round here?
- Yeah.

01:52:37.668 --> 01:52:38.840
OK.

01:52:40.879 --> 01:52:43.382
Then let's try the Westin.

01:52:44.299 --> 01:52:46.597
It's just round the corner.

01:52:47.552 --> 01:52:49.475
Sweet.

01:53:24.798 --> 01:53:27.017
Are you OK?
- Good.

01:53:28.302 --> 01:53:31.852
I'm OK. Are you OK?
- Yeah.

01:53:36.059 --> 01:53:38.778
Give me the money.

01:54:02.544 --> 01:54:05.514
I'll give you a hundred.

01:54:05.756 --> 01:54:08.134
I can't change that.

01:54:08.258 --> 01:54:11.637
Ah, no problem!

01:54:11.762 --> 01:54:15.517
Why, thank you!
- We just came from the slot machines.

01:54:17.726 --> 01:54:19.603
Very generous!

01:54:25.067 --> 01:54:29.322
So, here we are.
- Perfect.

01:54:30.906 --> 01:54:34.627
OK. Thank you.
- Have a nice day.

01:54:34.993 --> 01:54:36.666
Yes.
- Bye.

01:54:36.828 --> 01:54:38.080
Bye.

01:54:38.455 --> 01:54:41.584
We're going into a hotel?
- We go in...

01:54:43.293 --> 01:54:45.921
Come, let's go.

01:54:48.006 --> 01:54:50.805
Let's relax a little bit.

01:54:57.641 --> 01:54:59.063
Bye.
- Bye.

01:55:14.282 --> 01:55:18.037
Do you have a passport?
- Passport? No.

01:55:18.286 --> 01:55:22.336
We need a passport.
We need a passport to check in.

01:55:23.458 --> 01:55:26.382
That's a problem.
- No, no. Don't worry.

01:55:26.503 --> 01:55:29.473
You give me the money and I organise a room.

01:55:29.673 --> 01:55:31.141
Yeah. Come.

01:55:46.148 --> 01:55:49.322
I'll come in a minute.
- Yeah.

01:57:50.564 --> 01:57:52.282
Give me the money.

01:57:52.440 --> 01:57:56.866
I'm going to tell them a story
and organise a room.

01:57:57.028 --> 01:57:58.826
Good.

01:58:56.671 --> 01:58:58.673
Hey. Let's go.
- Now? - Yeah.

01:58:58.882 --> 01:59:00.805
I have a room.

01:59:01.468 --> 01:59:03.436
Are you OK?
- Yeah.

01:59:03.553 --> 01:59:05.146
Yeah? OK.

01:59:07.682 --> 01:59:09.434
Wait.
- Yeah

01:59:13.813 --> 01:59:15.156
It's this way.

01:59:18.610 --> 01:59:21.409
Hey. How are you? Are you OK?
- Yeah.

01:59:21.655 --> 01:59:23.578
Sure?
- Yeah!

01:59:33.124 --> 01:59:35.752
Sonne, are you OK?
- Yeah.

01:59:37.712 --> 01:59:41.182
Are you bleeding? Fuck!
Are you bleeding?

01:59:41.549 --> 01:59:45.179
Nothing. No, no.
- Show me. Show me.

01:59:45.428 --> 01:59:48.181
I just have to lay down.

01:59:54.646 --> 01:59:57.946
Are you OK?

01:59:59.776 --> 02:00:03.497
Are you OK or not?
Tell me the truth.

02:00:03.613 --> 02:00:05.490
Go. Go.

02:00:05.907 --> 02:00:08.751
Go! Go, go!
- Wait!

02:00:09.577 --> 02:00:10.920
<i>Come on!</i>

02:00:15.750 --> 02:00:18.299
It's there. OK?

02:00:19.170 --> 02:00:22.549
Can you walk?
- Hey? I'm good now.

02:00:23.299 --> 02:00:25.893
I'm good.
- Sure? - Yeah.

02:00:28.930 --> 02:00:30.898
It's cold.

02:00:32.308 --> 02:00:33.309
OK. Come.

02:00:37.939 --> 02:00:39.816
OK. Let's go.

02:01:02.464 --> 02:01:03.556
Wait.

02:01:12.557 --> 02:01:16.482
Come. Come.
Come on. Sonne, let's go.

02:01:16.853 --> 02:01:18.901
I just lay down.
- Yes.

02:01:19.063 --> 02:01:21.737
The bed, it's there. Go.

02:01:27.906 --> 02:01:30.375
In the bed! There! Go!

02:01:33.787 --> 02:01:36.040
Wait.

02:01:39.209 --> 02:01:41.507
Come. Come.

02:01:43.129 --> 02:01:44.255
Sonne!

02:01:47.091 --> 02:01:49.970
It's cold. Cold.
- Wait. Wait. Wait.

02:01:50.762 --> 02:01:51.979
Cold.

02:01:54.307 --> 02:01:56.605
Show me that. Really.

02:01:59.103 --> 02:02:00.776
You have to go to the hospital.

02:02:22.460 --> 02:02:24.258
I'm going to bring you water.

02:02:37.141 --> 02:02:42.774
...the police identified the getaway car,
which led to the first thief's arrest.

02:02:43.982 --> 02:02:49.204
There was a shootout between police and
the thieves here in Kochstrasse...

02:02:49.320 --> 02:02:54.167
One of the thieves died at the scene,
another one on the way to the hospital...

02:02:54.534 --> 02:02:59.543
Two suspects, a man and a woman in
their twenties, are still at large. Police...

02:03:12.844 --> 02:03:16.724
Sonne. Do you want some water?
Do you want some...?

02:03:31.362 --> 02:03:33.706
Sonne. Sonne.

02:03:34.032 --> 02:03:36.410
We have to go to the hospital, right now!
- No!

02:03:36.576 --> 02:03:38.704
Yes! We have to go to the hospital right now.

02:03:38.870 --> 02:03:41.544
No! No!
- You are going to die. You look like that.

02:03:48.504 --> 02:03:50.552
Come here!

02:03:50.632 --> 02:03:52.100
Sonne. Sonne.

02:03:52.383 --> 02:03:54.727
Listen, listen.

02:03:55.178 --> 02:03:59.103
You go... You go now...
You take the money.

02:04:00.683 --> 02:04:02.401
What?

02:04:05.271 --> 02:04:10.699
Nobody knows who you are.
Take the money. Go to Spain. You go. Go!

02:04:13.738 --> 02:04:17.117
Sonne, I'm going to call
a fucking ambulance, OK?

02:04:25.124 --> 02:04:29.174
Hi. We need an ambulance right now.
Yeah. Yeah, right now! Yeah!
