00:15.540 --> 00:17.508
When are
we gonna tell everybody

00:17.542 --> 00:18.876
about our wedding?

00:18.910 --> 00:20.077
Oh, we're not.

00:20.111 --> 00:22.112
Not till we make
all the plans, okay?

00:22.147 --> 00:23.380
Whoa-ho!

00:23.414 --> 00:24.915
All right.

00:24.949 --> 00:27.785
Oh, this guy is
all chewed up.

00:27.819 --> 00:29.920
Torn, actually.

00:29.954 --> 00:32.689
Missing phalanges, bone
fragments from the skull.

00:32.723 --> 00:34.625
Probably a hawk
fed on him.

00:34.659 --> 00:37.127
Don't you want to discuss it
with our friends, Booth?

00:37.162 --> 00:39.463
Oh, really? I mean, you really
want to get everyone's opinion

00:39.497 --> 00:41.398
on what they think
our wedding should be like?

00:41.432 --> 00:42.933
What, "You can't
have pigs in a blanket," huh?

00:42.967 --> 00:44.368
"No, no, you know what,
you should have

00:44.402 --> 00:45.803
"radishes that are
shaped like hummingbirds

00:45.837 --> 00:47.104
and wear dandelion hats."

00:47.138 --> 00:48.572
I've never even
seen those things.

00:48.606 --> 00:50.140
They exist.

00:50.175 --> 00:52.142
Based on decomp,
I'd estimate

00:52.177 --> 00:53.944
he's been here for
approximately three days.

00:53.978 --> 00:56.246
But Cam should probably
make that determination.

00:56.281 --> 00:58.816
We can wait for her
to get a definitive...

00:58.850 --> 01:00.450
No, no, no.
We're not...

01:00.485 --> 01:02.085
I've been dangling here
for long enough, all right?

01:02.120 --> 01:03.620
Things are... you know,
they're starting to pinch.

01:03.655 --> 01:06.156
Listen, Bones, all I'm saying,
that this is...

01:06.191 --> 01:08.058
Look, we've been
waiting a long time

01:08.092 --> 01:10.227
for this day,
for our wedding, all right?

01:10.261 --> 01:11.995
I just want this
to be our day. Don't you?

01:12.030 --> 01:13.564
But we'll invite
everybody, won't we?

01:13.598 --> 01:15.299
Of course.
Of course we are.

01:15.333 --> 01:16.366
You always say
that you know best.

01:16.401 --> 01:17.701
Based on the
palatine suture,

01:17.735 --> 01:19.703
the width of the
ascending ramus

01:19.737 --> 01:22.406
and the sternal
rib ends,

01:22.440 --> 01:26.276
the victim was a Caucasian
male in his early 50s.

01:26.311 --> 01:27.811
I do dislike it

01:27.846 --> 01:29.158
when other people
tell me what to do.

01:29.159 --> 01:31.481
See? Now there's the Bones
that I love, all right?

01:31.482 --> 01:32.482
We're gonna have
a great wedding.

01:32.517 --> 01:34.384
Whoo... all right.

01:34.419 --> 01:35.419
What are you doing?

01:35.453 --> 01:36.887
Aw...
That's right.

01:36.921 --> 01:38.922
Or whatever it's gonna be.
Okay.

01:38.957 --> 01:40.490
But... pigs
in a blanket?

01:40.525 --> 01:42.125
Yeah. Pigs in a blanket.

01:42.160 --> 01:43.393
It's God's perfect food.

01:43.428 --> 01:45.829
That might be
a point of contention.

01:45.864 --> 01:47.497
Come on.

01:47.532 --> 01:48.932
This looks like
an accident.

01:48.967 --> 01:50.367
Oh, no.
No one out of shape

01:50.401 --> 01:52.302
in their 50s, goes
rock climbing alone.

01:52.337 --> 01:53.233
This was a murder.

01:53.258 --> 01:54.805
You're making an
assumption, Booth.

01:54.806 --> 01:56.039
What?
Well, I'm that guy.

01:56.074 --> 01:57.274
I'm that gut guy, okay?

01:57.308 --> 01:58.709
I assume things.
That's what I do.

02:00.178 --> 02:01.545
Whoa!

02:01.579 --> 02:03.213
Then I'm going
to need to take

02:03.248 --> 02:04.781
the hawk back to
the lab, too.

02:04.816 --> 02:06.550
Is he eating a finger?

02:06.584 --> 02:09.219
Yes. He seems to be enjoying it.

02:10.321 --> 02:12.155
We'll need
Animal Control.

02:12.190 --> 02:15.259
No, we need to get
pulled up.

02:15.293 --> 02:17.527
Hey! Can we
get the hawk?

02:17.562 --> 02:20.697
Trust me, you're gonna like
pigs in a blanket.

02:25.403 --> 02:28.071
So I'm compiling character
traits of rock climbers

02:28.106 --> 02:29.606
and their psychosocial...
Great.

02:29.641 --> 02:31.441
You don't want to hear?
Oh, I get it.

02:31.476 --> 02:32.876
Psycho socials--
they're like dances,

02:32.911 --> 02:34.444
uh, you know,
in a loony bin.

02:34.479 --> 02:36.113
I got it, right?
Come on in.

02:36.147 --> 02:37.414
Shut the door, will you?

02:37.448 --> 02:39.016
Just... will you
shut the door for a second?

02:39.050 --> 02:40.050
What's going on?
Thanks.

02:40.084 --> 02:41.184
I just want to...

02:41.219 --> 02:42.819
want you to...

02:42.854 --> 02:44.328
just keep an open mind
about something here.

02:44.353 --> 02:44.955
About what?

02:44.956 --> 02:46.857
Is this about the wedding?
'Cause if you want

02:46.891 --> 02:48.825
to parachute from a plane or something,
No.

02:48.860 --> 02:50.394
I'm down. I'll do it.

02:50.428 --> 02:53.297
No one's parachuting
from a-a plane.

02:53.331 --> 02:54.798
Thank God.
You know, I actually

02:54.832 --> 02:56.512
have an awesome idea for a wedding.
Sweets.

02:56.534 --> 02:59.403
It's not about,
um, the wedding.

02:59.437 --> 03:00.604
It's about VAL.

03:00.638 --> 03:03.173
Who's that?
No. No. No.

03:03.207 --> 03:05.287
Because my last blind date
was a disaster, all right?

03:05.310 --> 03:07.177
She threw her drink
my ce because

03:07.211 --> 03:09.146
she didn't know what "masticate" meant.
This isn't a...

03:09.148 --> 03:11.515
It means to chew.
Sweets, just pay attention, okay?

03:11.549 --> 03:14.349
she didn't know what "masticate" meant.
I'd like to introduce you to...

03:15.119 --> 03:17.788
...VAL.

03:17.822 --> 03:20.524
Okay?
It's a Virtual something...

03:20.558 --> 03:22.359
Adumbrative.
Yes!

03:22.393 --> 03:23.827
That's the word.

03:23.861 --> 03:25.329
It's an artificial
profiling system.

03:25.363 --> 03:26.596
Right. You know...

03:26.631 --> 03:28.198
So everything I get
from the case,

03:28.232 --> 03:31.234
I got to input it into here
and so do the squints, so...

03:31.269 --> 03:32.569
Wow.

03:32.603 --> 03:34.404
They want to compare me
to a computer.

03:34.439 --> 03:36.106
I can't be replaced
by a video game.

03:36.140 --> 03:38.575
Listen, I had to... I just
felt like I had to tell you.

03:38.609 --> 03:39.676
Right? Because you're...

03:39.711 --> 03:41.411
you know... so I did.

03:41.446 --> 03:43.046
But if you tell anyone,
I'm gonna have to kill you.

03:43.081 --> 03:44.281
No, I understand.

03:44.315 --> 03:45.983
This is not
a problem, it's...

03:46.017 --> 03:47.584
it's a joke, is what...

03:47.618 --> 03:49.219
I-I agree.
It's a complete joke.

03:49.253 --> 03:50.954
Yeah.
To me, it's like that Russian guy

03:50.989 --> 03:52.289
who played the computer
in chess.

03:52.323 --> 03:53.323
It doesn't work.

03:53.358 --> 03:55.525
Exactly.

03:55.560 --> 03:59.262
Kasparov lost to
the computer, but...

03:59.297 --> 04:03.266
it's not a... it's not
a good comparison.

04:04.502 --> 04:07.270
Oh.

04:10.041 --> 04:11.408
What a beautiful bird.

04:11.442 --> 04:13.243
I know, right?

04:13.277 --> 04:15.879
And look how much
he's regurgitated.

04:15.913 --> 04:17.014
Excuse me?

04:17.048 --> 04:18.515
Yeah.

04:18.548 --> 04:20.149
See, hawks, they don't
have teeth, right?

04:20.151 --> 04:22.419
So they got to tear
and swallow clothes,

04:22.453 --> 04:24.755
flesh and bone whole,
and then they regurgitate

04:24.789 --> 04:26.023
what they can't,
you know, digest.

04:26.057 --> 04:27.491
This guy is full
of evidence.

04:27.525 --> 04:28.792
I mean, look at this.

04:28.826 --> 04:30.560
Honey, when you're
showing me puke,

04:30.595 --> 04:33.230
don't smile like that.
It's called rangle.

04:33.264 --> 04:35.098
See, when the stomach
contents come up,

04:35.133 --> 04:37.701
they're this hard, congealed...
Okay. I get it.

04:37.735 --> 04:39.770
I'm starting to feel like
I'm gonna rangle.

04:42.573 --> 04:44.808
Come on, buddy.

04:47.412 --> 04:49.546
Have you examined
these X-rays, Dr. Wells?

04:49.580 --> 04:51.448
Of course.
I took them.

04:51.482 --> 04:54.451
Lack of extensions along
the edges of the phalanges

04:54.485 --> 04:56.319
where the flexor
sheath attaches

04:56.354 --> 04:58.288
and an absence of
remodeled stress

04:58.322 --> 05:01.391
or other fractures in
the wrists and metacarpals

05:01.426 --> 05:04.261
indicate someone who has not
been rock climbing before.

05:04.295 --> 05:05.695
You shouldn't be reading,
Dr. Wells.

05:05.696 --> 05:07.464
I'm sorry. Was I wrong?

05:07.498 --> 05:08.598
That's beside the point.

05:08.633 --> 05:10.100
You're here to work, not read.

05:10.134 --> 05:11.635
Based on decomp

05:11.669 --> 05:13.336
and the desiccation
of the tissue,

05:13.371 --> 05:15.038
I'd estimate time of death at...

05:15.073 --> 05:16.440
Three days.

05:16.474 --> 05:18.008
Excuse me?
Three days.

05:18.042 --> 05:20.177
I factored in ambient
temperature at the scene,

05:20.211 --> 05:22.012
rainfall, the feeding
of the carrion...

05:22.046 --> 05:24.347
I-I'm sorry, but if you
were gonna say anything

05:24.382 --> 05:26.516
other than three days,
you'd be wrong.

05:26.551 --> 05:27.884
Now, can I just
finish my page?

05:27.919 --> 05:29.686
No.

05:36.360 --> 05:37.928
Oh, my God.

05:39.831 --> 05:42.065
Why am I never prepared
for what I see here?

05:42.100 --> 05:44.401
Alfred Adler would say that a
repression of visual stimuli...

05:44.435 --> 05:46.103
Why is he back?

05:46.137 --> 05:47.771
He's brilliant.

05:47.805 --> 05:49.773
Is that why he's reading
Mindy Kaling's book?

05:49.807 --> 05:51.741
I'm a polymath.

05:51.776 --> 05:53.376
I can learn from anything.

05:53.411 --> 05:54.744
How long will it take you

05:54.779 --> 05:56.379
to do a facial
reconstruction?

05:56.414 --> 05:58.048
Uh, damaged skull and
the dried tissue...

05:58.082 --> 05:59.516
The sooner
the better, really,

05:59.550 --> 06:01.718
because this dude was
definitely murdered.

06:01.752 --> 06:03.253
I think it's a little bit early

06:03.287 --> 06:04.721
to make that statement,
Dr. Wells.

06:04.755 --> 06:06.556
Perhaps not.

06:06.591 --> 06:08.792
The facial injuries
indicate that the victim

06:08.826 --> 06:10.427
struck the cliff face first.

06:10.461 --> 06:12.262
As if he were thrown off

06:12.296 --> 06:13.563
the edge of the cliff,
as Booth assumed.

06:13.598 --> 06:15.132
Well, then there's also

06:15.166 --> 06:17.934
hemorrhagic staining to
the wound around the parietal,

06:17.969 --> 06:21.505
which means
it occurred perimortem.

06:21.539 --> 06:23.607
So the wound to the parietal
was cause of death.

06:23.641 --> 06:25.108
Yes. The victim was
bludgeoned to death

06:25.143 --> 06:27.177
before going over
the side of that cliff.

06:27.211 --> 06:28.545
Now...

06:28.579 --> 06:29.980
can I finish my page?

06:32.383 --> 06:34.918
I'll take that as a "yes."

07:10.813 --> 07:11.979

07:12.014 --> 07:13.981
I'm just telling you
what VAL says.

07:14.016 --> 07:15.983
And how exactly does VAL
tell you these things?

07:16.018 --> 07:18.653
Oh, well, if I'm not in my
office, you know, she texts me.

07:18.687 --> 07:20.054
Look at that.

07:20.088 --> 07:21.489
"Perpetrator is
an experienced rock climber."

07:21.523 --> 07:23.257
I disagree.
So does the Jeffersonian.

07:23.292 --> 07:25.393
Noted, Sweets.
Okay? Just relax.

07:25.427 --> 07:28.062
Okay, can we please stop
calling it "her" and "she"?

07:28.096 --> 07:29.797
I mean...
Yeah.

07:29.832 --> 07:32.834
So why don't you think
the murderer is a climber?

07:32.868 --> 07:35.036
No, I don't think that the
killer isn't a climber,

07:35.070 --> 07:37.205
I just think it's
crazy to say that

07:37.239 --> 07:39.474
he's an experienced
rock climber.

07:39.508 --> 07:40.908
There's a difference.
Okay.

07:40.943 --> 07:42.376
You're agreeing with me,
which, you know...

07:42.411 --> 07:44.045
which is good.
I like it.

07:44.079 --> 07:46.347
So, our victim is
an amateur,

07:46.381 --> 07:48.382
he's vulnerable in
dangerous situations.

07:48.417 --> 07:50.451
He goes climbing with
someone who bashes him.

07:50.486 --> 07:52.887
While he's suiting up,
or whatever they call it.

07:52.921 --> 07:54.522
Good enough. And then
he tosses him over the edge

07:54.556 --> 07:55.756
and makes it
look like an accident.

07:55.791 --> 07:58.693
Did VAL tell you that?

07:58.727 --> 08:00.461
I don't think so.

08:07.936 --> 08:10.905
The victim exhibited bilateral
intercondylar fractures

08:10.939 --> 08:12.640
to the distal ends
of the femurs.

08:12.674 --> 08:15.776
Interesting, Dr. Wells, but
irrelevant for cause of death.

08:15.811 --> 08:17.678
Well, seeing as
how it occurred

08:17.713 --> 08:20.114
four months before the
victim died, I get it.

08:20.148 --> 08:21.415
Keep your shirt on.

08:21.450 --> 08:23.818
Dr. Wells,
you are an intern.

08:23.852 --> 08:25.920
Please treat Dr. Brennan
with the respect she's due.

08:25.954 --> 08:27.203
Well, I thought
this was a meritocracy.

08:27.204 --> 08:27.846
It is.

08:27.871 --> 08:29.871
Then that <i>was</i>
the respect she's due.

08:30.092 --> 08:32.226
No, no, it wasn't.
And since she's your...

08:32.260 --> 08:33.561
Don't say "superior."
...boss.

08:33.595 --> 08:34.929
But I will say
"superior" if I want,

08:34.962 --> 08:37.097
because I am also
your superior.

08:37.131 --> 08:38.399
Do you understand?

08:38.433 --> 08:40.835
So, Dr. Brennan,
have you set a date yet?

08:40.869 --> 08:42.436
For the wedding.

08:42.471 --> 08:44.639
Oh, we aren't adjusting
for anyone's schedule.

08:44.673 --> 08:47.742
If you have a conflict
and would like to attend,

08:47.776 --> 08:49.343
you'll have to rearrange
your schedule.

08:49.378 --> 08:51.012
Okay.

08:51.046 --> 08:52.446
That's a warm invitation.

08:53.315 --> 08:54.448
Concise,

08:54.483 --> 08:56.284
to the point.
Well said. Bravo.

08:56.318 --> 08:57.218
Thank you.

08:57.252 --> 08:58.419
I took a slide

08:58.453 --> 09:00.087
from the victim's liver,

09:00.122 --> 09:02.023
and as you can see...
Cancerous.

09:02.057 --> 09:03.324
Quite advanced.

09:03.358 --> 09:04.425
Our victim was terminal.

09:04.459 --> 09:05.993
Could you please see
if Angela has...

09:06.028 --> 09:08.062
Made any progress
on identifying the victim. Yes.

09:08.096 --> 09:09.597
Must you interrupt?

09:09.631 --> 09:11.599
I'm just trying to use
our time efficiently.

09:13.902 --> 09:16.437
Well, it doesn't make you
any more likeable.

09:16.471 --> 09:19.307
Is likability important?

09:19.341 --> 09:21.542
Right now, I'm gonna
go with "yes."

09:23.378 --> 09:25.479
How can you do
a facial reconstruction

09:25.514 --> 09:27.615
without any tissue markers?

09:27.649 --> 09:29.417
Well, I'm extrapolating
the missing fragments

09:29.451 --> 09:30.885
based on
the general characteristics

09:30.919 --> 09:32.386
of a Caucasian skull.

09:32.421 --> 09:34.121
Now I'm gonna run this
against the DMV database

09:34.156 --> 09:35.623
and see what
we come up with.

09:35.657 --> 09:36.991
The use of
a generic skull

09:37.025 --> 09:38.426
is gonna result
in far too many hits.

09:38.460 --> 09:41.195
You don't have
many friends, do you?

09:41.229 --> 09:42.597
No, I don't.

09:42.631 --> 09:44.031
None, really.

09:44.066 --> 09:45.967
Hmm. That's a shocker.

09:46.001 --> 09:47.501
This is a waste
of time.

09:49.538 --> 09:50.838
Wow, look at that.

09:50.872 --> 09:53.040
One match. Who knew?

09:53.075 --> 09:54.575
I suppose you think
your little ding

09:54.610 --> 09:55.610
taught me a lesson.

09:55.644 --> 09:56.978
Did it?

09:57.012 --> 09:58.145
Yes.

09:58.180 --> 10:00.381
Never discount
random luck.

10:06.521 --> 10:09.757
Having terminal cancer...
it's not good.

10:09.791 --> 10:11.926
"Terminal" means end point.

10:11.960 --> 10:13.094
The end. Death.

10:13.128 --> 10:14.495
And you know what?

10:14.529 --> 10:15.763
Life is better than death.

10:15.797 --> 10:17.098
That's deep.

10:17.132 --> 10:18.633
I don't think so.

10:18.667 --> 10:20.201
But impending death
bestows a gift

10:20.235 --> 10:21.435
I did not see coming.

10:21.470 --> 10:23.671
Clarity.
That's so true.

10:23.705 --> 10:25.373
Knowing the end is near
lends a bittersweet urgency

10:25.407 --> 10:28.209
to every breath, every moment.

10:28.243 --> 10:29.510
And you know what else?

10:29.544 --> 10:30.945
Fear evaporates.

10:30.979 --> 10:32.213
This is our victim?

10:32.247 --> 10:33.414
That's him.

10:33.448 --> 10:34.448
Charlie McCord.

10:34.483 --> 10:36.183
There you go.
Take a good look.

10:37.919 --> 10:41.055
High school principal,
married, two kids.

10:41.089 --> 10:42.356
What is this video?
Well, you know,

10:42.391 --> 10:44.025
when he found out
that he was gonna die,

10:44.059 --> 10:45.860
he made all these videos,
he created this Web site

10:45.894 --> 10:47.528
where you can buy them;
they're incredibly popular.

10:47.562 --> 10:50.464
It's not uncommon for people
to ascribe special wisdom

10:50.499 --> 10:52.033
to those who are
facing death.

10:52.067 --> 10:54.001
That's because
they have special wisdom.

10:54.036 --> 10:55.936
Watch, watch.

10:55.971 --> 10:57.738
And fear is what stands

10:57.773 --> 10:59.540
between us and fulfillment.

10:59.574 --> 11:00.941
Once fear is gone,

11:00.976 --> 11:03.444
life opens up
to all its grandeur.

11:03.478 --> 11:04.945
All things are possible.

11:04.980 --> 11:07.314
This guy's deep.

11:09.651 --> 11:11.986
Why do you need
our victim's ear canal?

11:12.020 --> 11:13.220
Oh, yes.

11:13.255 --> 11:15.456
I want to analyze
the cerumen.

11:15.490 --> 11:17.391
The earwax?

11:17.426 --> 11:19.427
It's less icky
if I call it cerumen.

11:19.461 --> 11:20.761
Look at this.

11:20.796 --> 11:22.596
It builds up like sediment.

11:22.631 --> 11:25.199
You can track his recent
activities through earwax?

11:25.233 --> 11:27.501
Cerumen.
And even though

11:27.536 --> 11:29.637
he snacks on dead humans,
he's not a buzzard.

11:29.671 --> 11:31.005
He's a hawk, Cam.

11:31.039 --> 11:33.641
Hey, he's a hawk.

11:36.745 --> 11:39.346
Hey, labels are important,
you know?

11:39.381 --> 11:41.982
'Cause words can hurt.

11:42.017 --> 11:45.319
<i>I can't believe Charlie's dead.</i>

11:45.353 --> 11:47.088
When was the last time
you saw your husband?

11:47.122 --> 11:48.756
Four days ago.

11:48.790 --> 11:50.825
Can you think of anyone
who'd want to hurt your husband?

11:50.859 --> 11:52.693
Uh, no.

11:52.728 --> 11:54.228
I-I mean,

11:54.262 --> 11:57.164
there were some comments
underneath his videos

11:57.199 --> 11:58.632
that were pretty mean.

11:58.667 --> 12:00.468
People who said
that he was stupid,

12:00.502 --> 12:02.203
or that he was
faking his illness

12:02.237 --> 12:03.304
to make money, but...

12:03.338 --> 12:04.638
You found Charlie

12:04.673 --> 12:06.140
climbing a cliff?

12:06.174 --> 12:07.475
Is that strange?

12:07.509 --> 12:09.110
Well, he was afraid of heights.

12:09.144 --> 12:10.745
"Well, when fear is gone,

12:10.779 --> 12:13.080
life opens up all its grandeur."

12:13.115 --> 12:15.716
You've seen one of his videos.

12:15.751 --> 12:17.084
Yeah, well, he was a wise man.

12:17.119 --> 12:18.586
He was hoping maybe

12:18.620 --> 12:20.154
someone would see them
and pay us

12:20.188 --> 12:21.555
for the rights to write a book.

12:21.590 --> 12:22.923
Turns out,
people are willing

12:22.958 --> 12:24.458
to buy them
the way they are.

12:24.493 --> 12:25.960
It's typical.

12:25.994 --> 12:27.528
Charlie's dying,

12:27.562 --> 12:29.897
and he's worrying
about me and the kids.

12:31.533 --> 12:34.335
I'm sorry, wasn't he in pain?

12:34.369 --> 12:35.369
Constantly.

12:35.403 --> 12:36.637
The autopsy didn't show

12:36.671 --> 12:39.273
any narcotics in his system.

12:39.307 --> 12:41.142
Charlie wanted to put off drugs
for as long as he could.

12:41.176 --> 12:44.445
He would only take
homeopathic medicine.

12:44.479 --> 12:47.081
He was a wonderful man.

12:47.115 --> 12:48.783
Anyone who knew him

12:48.817 --> 12:52.686
would tell you
that he was special.

12:58.627 --> 13:01.428
I recovered several videos
from the victim's cell phone,

13:01.463 --> 13:04.398
one of which you'll find
extremely interesting.

13:04.432 --> 13:06.033
One of his "live
life to the fullest

13:06.067 --> 13:07.535
'cause life is
too short" videos?

13:07.569 --> 13:08.669
Uh, not exactly.

13:08.703 --> 13:10.404
This was time-stamped

13:10.438 --> 13:12.606
five days before
the murder.

13:12.641 --> 13:14.909
Hey, Chuck, Chuck.

13:14.943 --> 13:17.278
Hey, man, big fan.

13:18.346 --> 13:20.347
What?

13:20.382 --> 13:22.583
Obviously, somebody took
this video.

13:22.617 --> 13:24.118
Wow, that hurt.

13:27.289 --> 13:29.456
Pull over!

13:29.491 --> 13:30.691
Hey, pull over!

13:30.725 --> 13:32.193
He's mad.

13:32.227 --> 13:35.062
That was
incredibly cowardly.

13:35.096 --> 13:36.730
Well...
Come on, Angela,

13:36.765 --> 13:39.300
how much courage does it take
to sucker punch someone?

13:39.334 --> 13:41.468
A lot when it's this guy.

13:42.437 --> 13:43.838
Oh, my God.

13:43.872 --> 13:47.541
Yeah, this is Chuck
"The Iceman" Liddell.

13:47.576 --> 13:50.044
He's a mixed martial arts
world champion.

13:50.078 --> 13:52.613
So, Charlie McCord slugged
the toughest man in the world?

13:52.647 --> 13:54.081
Yeah.

13:54.115 --> 13:57.551
And revenge is sort of
the Iceman's thing.

14:04.867 --> 14:06.401
Pull over!

14:06.435 --> 14:07.502
Hey, pull over!

14:07.536 --> 14:08.703
He's mad.

14:08.738 --> 14:10.308
Yeah, that's me.
So what?

14:10.309 --> 14:11.909
Getting punched in the face
a crime now?

14:11.944 --> 14:13.177
No, murder was the crime.

14:13.211 --> 14:14.612
This guy was murdered
four days ago.

14:14.646 --> 14:15.680
You think I did it?

14:15.714 --> 14:16.781
Look at you, huh?

14:16.815 --> 14:18.182
Looks like you're mad enough.

14:18.216 --> 14:20.184
People come up to me
all the time.

14:20.218 --> 14:23.287
Sign an autograph,
take a picture with them.

14:23.322 --> 14:25.156
I don't get punched
in the face for it.

14:25.190 --> 14:26.357
So you're saying
you never saw him before?

14:26.391 --> 14:27.858
Not till Charlie
threw the punch.

14:27.893 --> 14:29.360
Wait, then how do you know
his name?

14:29.394 --> 14:31.028
He called me after.
Apparently,

14:31.063 --> 14:33.030
I was on his bucket list--
you know, a list of stuff

14:33.065 --> 14:35.299
you want to do before you die?
So let me get this straight.

14:35.334 --> 14:38.669
Uh, "punch the Iceman"
was on his bucket list?

14:38.704 --> 14:40.605
Yeah, I was kind of flattered
when I heard.

14:40.639 --> 14:42.273
He's a nice guy.

14:42.307 --> 14:43.874
Really sorry to hear
what happened.

14:43.909 --> 14:46.877
Uh, let me know
if there's anything I can do.

14:52.818 --> 14:54.719
There's evidence that the finger

14:54.753 --> 14:56.887
was treated after he
slugged the Iceman.

14:56.922 --> 14:58.122
That's the least
of his worries.

14:58.156 --> 14:59.757
He only had six weeks
to live.

14:59.791 --> 15:02.927
There are so many variables
to an assessment like that

15:02.961 --> 15:04.629
that it is practically guessing.

15:04.663 --> 15:07.565
But if McCord was told
he only had six weeks,

15:07.599 --> 15:10.301
that would explain
his risk-taking.

15:10.335 --> 15:12.069
Would it not,
Dr. Know-it-all?

15:12.104 --> 15:13.504
I will concede that.

15:13.538 --> 15:15.606
That's mighty big of you.

15:15.641 --> 15:16.941
What's this?

15:16.975 --> 15:18.542
I was thinking about

15:18.577 --> 15:21.178
the victim's bucket list,
so I made one for you.

15:21.213 --> 15:22.780
'Cause we all
need one, right?

15:22.814 --> 15:24.815
"Number one, don't be a douche.

15:24.850 --> 15:26.083
"Number two, really,

15:26.118 --> 15:27.585
"don't be a douche.

15:27.619 --> 15:29.954
"Number three, work and
play well with others

15:29.988 --> 15:31.856
so I'm not perceived
as a douche."

15:31.890 --> 15:33.557
Do I have to read all ten?

15:33.592 --> 15:35.793
Probably not.
You think it's easy

15:35.827 --> 15:37.028
being superior?

15:37.030 --> 15:38.863
It's a curse, I assure you.

15:38.897 --> 15:40.297
Mostly for us.

15:40.332 --> 15:42.933
There must be a heart in
there someplace, Oliver.

15:42.968 --> 15:45.002
I'm just trying to
help; it's tough love.

15:45.037 --> 15:48.339
It's misguided,
but I understand.

15:49.641 --> 15:51.642
I don't even think
he had six weeks.

15:51.677 --> 15:52.810
Look at this.

15:52.844 --> 15:54.812
The cancer was spreading
to his bones.

15:54.846 --> 15:57.214
Look at the marrow;
see how porous it is?

15:57.249 --> 15:59.483
Yeah, he was never
gonna finish his list.

15:59.518 --> 16:01.018
Poor guy.

16:01.053 --> 16:03.020
Murdered before he had
a chance to die.

16:03.055 --> 16:04.655
Sad.

16:04.690 --> 16:07.458
Really?
Yeah.

16:07.492 --> 16:09.960
I mean, we all want
a little more time, don't we?

16:09.995 --> 16:12.797
To fix things, to go out with
our ducks in a row.

16:12.831 --> 16:14.832
Check his medical records,
see if you can

16:14.866 --> 16:16.801
find out who treated his finger.

16:16.835 --> 16:19.170
Maybe that will lead to
who shot the cell phone video.

16:19.204 --> 16:20.538
Okay.

16:22.407 --> 16:26.343
Computer profiling
is absurd, okay?

16:26.378 --> 16:29.914
Psychology takes, um, subtlety
and a subjective analysis.

16:29.948 --> 16:31.248
Subjective?
Yeah.

16:31.283 --> 16:32.883
Well, that's the problem.

16:32.918 --> 16:37.154
A computer program with
advanced analytical algorithms

16:37.189 --> 16:39.190
would not be subjective;
it would skirt

16:39.224 --> 16:40.624
the pitfalls of Heisenberg's
uncertainty principle.

16:40.659 --> 16:42.259
So you're saying

16:42.294 --> 16:44.254
after all we've been through,
you think a computer

16:44.262 --> 16:45.529
would be better than me?

16:45.564 --> 16:46.931
Theoretically, yes.

16:46.965 --> 16:48.733
Hey, how's it going?

16:48.767 --> 16:50.434
How's it going?
I'll tell you how it's going.

16:50.469 --> 16:53.671
Dr. Brennan would rather
work with a computer than me.

16:53.705 --> 16:56.874
But as a lunch companion,
I certainly prefer you.

16:56.908 --> 16:58.242
You know what,
that's high praise, Sweets.

16:58.276 --> 16:59.716
Anyhow, VAL says
that the bucket list

16:59.745 --> 17:00.845
shows that the victim was--

17:00.879 --> 17:02.179
uh, let's see, it says here--

17:02.214 --> 17:03.948
"vulnerable because
of his illness.

17:03.982 --> 17:06.650
"The guise of him as a
sincerely good man is a mask

17:06.685 --> 17:08.319
to hide his anger
and hostility."

17:08.353 --> 17:10.421
That's stupid.

17:10.454 --> 17:11.454
That's lame psycho-babble.

17:11.490 --> 17:12.656
Stupid. I hope they didn't

17:12.691 --> 17:14.425
spend too much on that program.

17:14.459 --> 17:15.659
I heard three million.

17:15.694 --> 17:17.261
- What?
- Three million dollars?

17:17.295 --> 17:19.329
I...
And they can't give me a raise.

17:19.364 --> 17:21.397
You know, I'm seriously
like Call of Duty,

17:21.433 --> 17:23.233
and-and that thing is like

17:23.268 --> 17:24.969
Elf Bowling.
All right,

17:25.002 --> 17:27.003
show me what you got
there, Mr. Call of Duty.

17:27.038 --> 17:29.540
I've analyzed Charlie's videos;
he's a genuinely good man.

17:29.574 --> 17:31.675
The essence of a bucket list
isn't vulnerability.

17:31.710 --> 17:33.911
It's rooted
in the simple human desire

17:33.945 --> 17:36.781
to realize one's potential
before death.

17:36.815 --> 17:38.415
I buy that.
You know what,

17:38.450 --> 17:40.251
computer zero, Sweets one.
Good work, you're back.

17:40.285 --> 17:41.552
Thank you.

17:41.586 --> 17:43.287
VAL is a moron, all right?

17:43.321 --> 17:45.322
Everyone has some kind
of a bucket list.

17:45.357 --> 17:47.158
I don't have a list, per se.

17:47.192 --> 17:49.727
Well, winning the
Nobel, of course,

17:49.761 --> 17:52.029
but that's more
of an eventuality than a dream.

17:52.063 --> 17:53.164
I've got, like,

17:53.198 --> 17:54.532
a million things on my list.

17:54.566 --> 17:55.466
Really?

17:55.500 --> 17:56.934
If you could pick one?

17:56.968 --> 17:58.102
All right, um, you know the guy

17:58.136 --> 17:59.416
who did the free-fall
from space?

17:59.437 --> 18:01.205
ah.
Yeah.

18:02.140 --> 18:04.441
I'd like to buy him a drink.

18:04.476 --> 18:05.576
That...

18:05.610 --> 18:06.977
That's...

18:07.012 --> 18:08.345
Okay.

18:08.380 --> 18:09.980
Brennan.

18:10.015 --> 18:11.649
Hi, Angela.

18:11.683 --> 18:13.717
You don't want to free-fall?
Yes.

18:13.752 --> 18:15.085
Who? All right.

18:15.120 --> 18:17.188
Yes, Booth is here;
I'll tell him.

18:18.957 --> 18:20.624
Angela got
the victim's medical records.

18:20.659 --> 18:22.760
His wife wasn't listed
as the emergency contact

18:22.794 --> 18:25.062
for any of
his hospital stays.

18:25.096 --> 18:26.964
It was a man
named Martin Proctor.

18:26.998 --> 18:28.232
So the victim
might not have trusted

18:28.266 --> 18:29.667
his wife as much as we thought.

18:39.744 --> 18:41.679
Are you busy?

18:41.713 --> 18:43.013
Hey.

18:43.048 --> 18:44.448
Is something wrong?

18:44.482 --> 18:45.816
Wrong? No, I don't think so.

18:45.851 --> 18:46.851
Is there?

18:46.885 --> 18:47.918
I-I don't know.

18:47.953 --> 18:49.320
You seem like you want to talk.

18:49.354 --> 18:50.554
I do.

18:50.589 --> 18:51.655
Is that wrong?

18:51.690 --> 18:53.224
No, I...

18:53.258 --> 18:54.992
Forget it.

18:55.026 --> 18:56.427
No, I-I'm not busy, no.

18:56.461 --> 18:57.862
Good.

18:57.896 --> 19:00.397
You remember that I'm going
to marry Booth?

19:00.432 --> 19:03.300
I vaguely recollect that, yeah.

19:05.036 --> 19:08.272
Oh, no.

19:08.306 --> 19:11.075
He didn't call it off again,
did he?

19:11.109 --> 19:13.310
Because I can do
physical harm.

19:13.345 --> 19:14.812
No, no.

19:14.846 --> 19:16.780
We've just decided

19:16.815 --> 19:19.450
that we don't want anyone else
to help us plan our wedding.

19:19.484 --> 19:21.785
Oh.
Guests will be that, just guests.

19:21.820 --> 19:24.488
And if they don't like
pigs in blankets,

19:24.522 --> 19:26.490
they may have to bring
their own snacks.

19:26.524 --> 19:29.193
Booth and I haven't figured out
all the details yet.

19:29.227 --> 19:31.462
I don't care how
or where you do it, sweetie.

19:31.496 --> 19:34.531
I got married in a jail cell,
for God's sake.

19:36.301 --> 19:39.103
Booth is a good man, Angela.

19:39.137 --> 19:41.605
He didn't want to hurt me.

19:41.640 --> 19:43.173
It was Pelant who kept us apart.

19:43.208 --> 19:46.343
Until he was gone,
Booth's hands were tied.

19:46.378 --> 19:49.513
Yeah, I should've
trusted him, huh?

19:49.547 --> 19:51.782
Yes.

19:51.816 --> 19:53.851
But it was hard

19:53.885 --> 19:56.787
for me, too, at the time.

19:56.821 --> 20:00.391
Well, listen,
whatever you two decide,

20:00.425 --> 20:02.660
I'm sure it's gonna be perfect.

20:02.694 --> 20:04.495
I'm not gonna
say another word.

20:04.529 --> 20:07.264
That will make Booth very happy.

20:07.299 --> 20:10.968
Listen, I was hoping to help
with the dress, though.

20:11.002 --> 20:12.970
I just don't want
you ending up

20:13.004 --> 20:15.005
in a grass skirt
and a headdress.

20:15.040 --> 20:17.841
And that will make me
very happy.

20:17.876 --> 20:19.076
And isn't that

20:19.110 --> 20:20.411
what a matron of honor

20:20.445 --> 20:22.046
is supposed to do?

20:22.080 --> 20:23.981
Oh, my God.

20:27.686 --> 20:29.053
Thank you.

20:29.087 --> 20:30.721
It's "maid of honor."

20:30.755 --> 20:33.557
Well, technically,
you're married, so it's matron.

20:35.293 --> 20:38.262
Usually, we'd expect to see
his wife listed

20:38.296 --> 20:39.496
as the emergency contact.

20:39.531 --> 20:41.098
Charlie couldn't do that.

20:41.132 --> 20:42.766
He didn't want his wife
to worry.

20:42.801 --> 20:45.202
You were helping him
with his bucket list.

20:45.236 --> 20:47.604
Was. It was
getting too crazy.

20:47.639 --> 20:49.506
I told him if he was
gonna kill himself,

20:49.541 --> 20:51.008
I wouldn't be a part of it.

20:51.042 --> 20:52.109
What was your relationship
with Charlie?

20:52.143 --> 20:53.310
I blew my shoulder out

20:53.345 --> 20:54.979
pitching when I was
a student here.

20:55.013 --> 20:56.380
Torn rotator cuff.

20:56.414 --> 20:58.682
A couple years ago,
before Charlie got sick,

20:58.717 --> 21:00.351
he got me a job in
the IT department.

21:00.385 --> 21:03.787
Then he set me up as coach
of the baseball team, too.

21:03.822 --> 21:05.522
Oh, wow, so he was like
a father figure to you.

21:05.557 --> 21:07.324
Yeah.

21:07.359 --> 21:08.959
And you helped him

21:08.994 --> 21:10.027
video his lectures?

21:10.061 --> 21:11.161
Edit them, too.

21:11.196 --> 21:13.230
Charlie and I...

21:13.264 --> 21:14.531
we were tight.

21:14.566 --> 21:16.333
Even working on this
charity together,

21:16.368 --> 21:18.135
Quarters for Care.

21:18.169 --> 21:19.570
Where were you four days ago?

21:19.604 --> 21:23.107
Uh, what are you...
what are you saying?

21:23.141 --> 21:24.908
Nothing, just doing my job.

21:24.943 --> 21:26.877
Yeah.

21:28.213 --> 21:29.780
Yeah, sorry.

21:30.648 --> 21:34.351
Uh, four days ago...

21:36.287 --> 21:37.755
Batting practice in the morning,

21:37.789 --> 21:40.391
and then went to a movie
at Wheaton Plaza.

21:40.425 --> 21:42.292
I think I still have
the ticket stub.

21:43.528 --> 21:46.563
Charlie always said
I was too fussy.

21:46.598 --> 21:49.666
It's okay, but do you have
a copy of his bucket list?

21:49.701 --> 21:52.236
Um...

21:54.305 --> 21:57.741
Charlie didn't want Linda
to see the list.

21:57.776 --> 21:59.643
There are only two left:
"go rock climbing

21:59.677 --> 22:01.045
and make Lena whole."

22:01.079 --> 22:03.414
Okay, um, who's Lena?

22:03.448 --> 22:04.648
Lena Silver.

22:04.682 --> 22:06.650
She was a bookkeeper
for the school.

22:06.684 --> 22:08.318
Charlie caught her cheating,

22:08.353 --> 22:10.487
turned her in; she
wound up going to jail.

22:10.522 --> 22:11.989
Charlie felt pretty bad
about it,

22:12.023 --> 22:13.357
so he was tracking her down.

22:13.391 --> 22:15.059
You think she wanted revenge?

22:15.093 --> 22:16.693
She always seemed nice.

22:16.728 --> 22:19.129
But she lost everything
when she went to jail.

22:19.164 --> 22:21.231
Even her kids.

22:27.990 --> 22:29.458
Oh, come on.

22:29.492 --> 22:30.625
You have VAL, too?

22:30.660 --> 22:32.127
I'm not supposed to tell you.

22:32.161 --> 22:33.829
Yeah, no, neither was Booth.

22:33.863 --> 22:35.330
Thanks.

22:35.364 --> 22:37.065
So, what you should
be hearing

22:37.100 --> 22:39.468
is that we prefer you
to Optimus Prime here.

22:39.502 --> 22:40.569
Who says...

22:40.603 --> 22:41.937
Oh, VAL told you something, huh?

22:41.971 --> 22:44.106
According to VAL,

22:44.140 --> 22:46.475
someone named Lena Silver
is our prime suspect,

22:46.509 --> 22:49.478
with an 86% chance
she committed the murder.

22:49.512 --> 22:51.012
Do you even know
who that is?

22:51.047 --> 22:53.014
Yeah. Lena Silver was
the bookkeeper

22:53.049 --> 22:54.649
for the victim's school.

22:54.684 --> 22:57.085
He reported her for
embezzling $6,000,

22:57.120 --> 22:59.488
she lost her job,
went to jail, lost her kids.

22:59.522 --> 23:01.456
Went to jail for six grand?
Yeah.

23:01.491 --> 23:03.391
Ensuing investigations uncovered
other thefts, so...

23:03.426 --> 23:05.427
Sounds like a motive.

23:05.461 --> 23:08.163
Could you be 86% certain
without any proof?

23:08.197 --> 23:09.364
No.
No.

23:09.398 --> 23:10.799
VAL is, huh?

23:10.833 --> 23:12.100
No one's even talked
to the woman yet.

23:12.135 --> 23:13.568
I hate VAL.

23:13.603 --> 23:14.970
She is stupid.

23:15.004 --> 23:16.271
I hate her.
"It."

23:16.305 --> 23:17.372
You hate "it."

23:17.406 --> 23:18.740
You might as well hate

23:18.774 --> 23:20.142
a transistor radio.

23:21.611 --> 23:24.913
We're all on
your side, Sweets.

23:24.947 --> 23:26.314
Yeah.

23:37.326 --> 23:38.493
Whoa.

23:38.528 --> 23:40.829
Um, should you
be doing that?

23:40.863 --> 23:43.031
Well, I figure if I
hurry up and feed him,

23:43.065 --> 23:46.001
maybe he'll hurry up and rangle
the last bit of evidence.

23:46.035 --> 23:48.436
Hey, I got results
from Charlie's ears.

23:48.471 --> 23:50.005
So, cerumen, right,

23:50.039 --> 23:53.008
it accumulates at a rate
of .01 millimeters per day.

23:53.042 --> 23:55.177
Now, this...

23:55.211 --> 23:56.745
Ooh, no, nope.
Sorry, not that.

23:56.779 --> 23:57.879
Your bucket list?

23:57.914 --> 24:00.315
Yeah, yeah,
I got inspired.

24:00.349 --> 24:02.150
I got to check out Area 51,
you know?

24:02.185 --> 24:03.985
I mean, the real one,
not the fake one

24:04.020 --> 24:05.420
they pawn off
on tourists.

24:05.454 --> 24:06.621
Can't die without that.

24:06.656 --> 24:07.622
Earwax?

24:07.657 --> 24:09.925
Right.

24:09.959 --> 24:11.493
Yuck.

24:11.527 --> 24:13.094
All that was in his ear?

24:13.129 --> 24:15.497
Mm-hmm. .02 millimeters in,
I found acetylene black,

24:15.531 --> 24:17.632
polyisoprene, halobutyl,
sulfide,

24:17.667 --> 24:20.769
nylon, copper, sulphur
and steel particulates.

24:20.803 --> 24:22.437
Okay, so sulphur,
copper sulfide--

24:22.471 --> 24:24.739
sounds like he was sleeping
with a chemistry set.

24:24.774 --> 24:26.074
Tires.
Tires?

24:26.108 --> 24:27.542
Pyrolysis.

24:27.577 --> 24:29.578
Pyrolysis is

24:29.612 --> 24:31.146
the thermochemical
decomposition of materials

24:31.180 --> 24:32.681
in the absence of oxygen.

24:32.715 --> 24:35.383
He was at
a tire recycling facility?

24:35.418 --> 24:38.453
Yep. And based on the depth
of the chemicals

24:38.487 --> 24:40.522
in the cerumen,
two days before he died.

24:40.556 --> 24:43.258
Angie could only find one
in the tri-state area.

24:43.292 --> 24:44.459
"Riley's Tire Depot."

24:44.493 --> 24:46.027
Mm-hmm.

24:46.062 --> 24:48.897
They have absolutely no
record of Charlie buying,

24:48.931 --> 24:51.766
selling or dropping off tires
in the last couple weeks.

24:51.801 --> 24:54.369
I'll tell Booth.

24:54.403 --> 24:58.607
Did I see that you wanted
to be shot out of a cannon?

24:58.641 --> 24:59.741
You don't?

24:59.775 --> 25:02.244
But first,
I want to leap

25:02.278 --> 25:04.446
from the top of the Jungfrau
wearing one of those

25:04.480 --> 25:06.281
Rocky the Flying Squirrel suits,
you know?

25:06.315 --> 25:07.582
Of course you do.

25:07.617 --> 25:09.117
Hey, but that's
just the tip of

25:09.151 --> 25:10.986
the iceberg, you know?
What about you?

25:11.020 --> 25:14.356
Oh, I...

25:14.390 --> 25:16.825
just want a villa in Tuscany

25:16.859 --> 25:19.294
where I can drink wine
and make love.

25:19.328 --> 25:20.829
That's it?

25:20.863 --> 25:22.597
Lot of wine and a lot of love.

25:26.602 --> 25:28.203
And not seeing a bird barf.

25:28.237 --> 25:30.839
Ooh, rangle time.

25:30.873 --> 25:33.575
I can cross this off my list.

25:33.609 --> 25:35.777
I was able to reconstruct
the skull

25:35.811 --> 25:38.280
with fragments
that the bird barfed up.

25:38.314 --> 25:39.781
The fracture
to the parietal

25:39.815 --> 25:42.183
would have caused
the dura mater to be torn.

25:42.218 --> 25:43.485
Very good, Dr. Brennan.

25:43.519 --> 25:45.820
I say "very good," Dr. Wells.

25:45.855 --> 25:47.489
Not you.

25:47.523 --> 25:50.158
Why can't I verbally recognize
your small triumphs?

25:50.192 --> 25:52.527
I don't know.

25:52.561 --> 25:54.396
Note the series

25:54.430 --> 25:56.798
of radiating
depression fractures.

25:56.832 --> 25:59.200
Normally, radiating fractures
on a skull terminate

25:59.235 --> 26:01.369
when they encounter
a previous fracture.

26:01.404 --> 26:03.505
The fractures
on this skull all overlap

26:03.539 --> 26:06.174
as if they happened
at the same time.

26:06.208 --> 26:08.176
The wound has
characteristics

26:08.210 --> 26:10.045
of an injury occurring
from one blow

26:10.079 --> 26:12.113
and multiple blows.

26:12.148 --> 26:13.715
The evidence contradicts itself.

26:13.749 --> 26:16.251
So we still don't know
what the murder weapon was?

26:16.285 --> 26:18.586
He was either struck
three times or once.

26:18.621 --> 26:20.021
How can it be both?

26:20.056 --> 26:23.325
So it's really
a philosophical question.

26:23.359 --> 26:24.726
No, Dr. Wells, it isn't.

26:24.760 --> 26:27.529
Because it actually happened.

26:27.563 --> 26:30.031
<i>Most of the people I look up to</i>

26:30.066 --> 26:33.868
have taken great risks,
both personal and professional.

26:33.903 --> 26:37.839
Real growth comes from
taking chances.

26:37.873 --> 26:39.374
That's true.

26:39.408 --> 26:40.909
Well, he must be right,

26:40.943 --> 26:43.011
because Charlie McCord
was doing a great business

26:43.045 --> 26:44.813
off these videos
before he died.

26:44.847 --> 26:46.481
Two bucks a pop.

26:46.515 --> 26:48.149
Wow. And after he died?

26:48.184 --> 26:49.517
With that publicity?

26:49.552 --> 26:51.252
Thousands of downloads an hour.

26:51.287 --> 26:54.656
The wife will clean up
if it keeps going at this rate.

26:54.690 --> 26:56.291
Another motive.

26:59.628 --> 27:02.397
You know what?
Maybe VAL is right.

27:02.431 --> 27:03.898
I mean,
Lena Silver lives

27:03.933 --> 27:05.934
right next to
Riley's Tire Depot.

27:05.968 --> 27:07.635
Do you have a tuxedo?

27:07.670 --> 27:09.838
No. Oh, you mean
for the wedding?

27:09.872 --> 27:10.872
Yes.

27:10.906 --> 27:12.240
Ah. No, do I need one?

27:12.274 --> 27:14.309
Well, if I will be wearing
a wedding dress,

27:14.343 --> 27:15.977
we'd look more like
we belong together

27:16.011 --> 27:17.379
if you're wearing a tuxedo.

27:17.413 --> 27:19.381
Like we're standing
on top of a cake.

27:19.415 --> 27:20.915
Yes.
With frosting down below.

27:20.950 --> 27:22.317
Yeah.
Ah!

27:22.351 --> 27:24.152
Okay, I'll get a tuxedo.
And shiny shoes.

27:24.186 --> 27:25.387
So we're going formal?

27:25.421 --> 27:27.756
Yes, yes, in a church.
Your church.

27:27.790 --> 27:29.624
I've-I've studied
the ceremony.

27:29.658 --> 27:30.825
It's beautiful.

27:30.860 --> 27:32.260
Even the superstitions.

27:32.294 --> 27:33.495
You sure?

27:33.529 --> 27:35.597
It would make you happy,
wouldn't it?

27:35.631 --> 27:37.899
So, then it'll
make me happy, too.

27:37.933 --> 27:40.602
Tell you what, if we weren't
waiting for a murder suspect to

27:40.636 --> 27:43.171
open up that door,
I would take you in my arms...

27:43.205 --> 27:44.773
Whoa, okay! Oh-oh, easy.

27:44.807 --> 27:47.008
FBI, okay?
Put the weapon down.

27:47.042 --> 27:49.277
Sorry.
It's a tough neighborhood.

27:49.311 --> 27:50.645
Are you Lena Silver?

27:50.679 --> 27:52.647
Yes.
Booth, isn't that a violation

27:52.681 --> 27:55.083
of her parole to have
a weapon that could have

27:55.117 --> 27:56.785
been used to kill
Charlie McCord?

27:56.819 --> 27:59.120
Okay, we're gonna have
to take you into custody, Lena.

28:02.371 --> 28:05.039
You must have been very angry
at Charlie, Miss Silver.

28:05.247 --> 28:06.414
He ruined your life.

28:06.448 --> 28:07.982
No, he didn't.
I did.

28:08.016 --> 28:10.084
When he turned me in,
Charlie didn't know

28:10.118 --> 28:11.352
I had two prior arrests.

28:11.386 --> 28:13.687
Was I gonna blame him
for that, too?

28:13.722 --> 28:17.024
So he got you arrested,
and you thanked him?

28:17.059 --> 28:19.060
At the time,
I wanted to kill him.

28:19.094 --> 28:21.796
But that was before
I went into counseling.

28:21.830 --> 28:26.067
And to be honest,
before I saw Charlie's videos.

28:26.101 --> 28:27.601
So after watching Charlie,
you learned to

28:27.636 --> 28:30.204
accept your situation
and forgive yourself?

28:30.238 --> 28:31.872
Is there something wrong
with that?

28:31.907 --> 28:34.208
No, I think
it's very impressive.

28:34.242 --> 28:37.645
Bitterness and anger aren't
gonna help me build a new life.

28:37.679 --> 28:40.981
Or get your kids back.

28:41.016 --> 28:44.151
And killing Charlie wouldn't
help get my kids back either.

28:44.186 --> 28:45.466
No, but sometimes we don't think

28:45.487 --> 28:46.821
of all the consequences
before we act.

28:46.855 --> 28:49.390
People can change, Dr. Sweets.

28:49.424 --> 28:51.058
I'm proof of that.

28:51.093 --> 28:52.560
And when I get my kids back,

28:52.594 --> 28:54.395
they're gonna have a mom
they can be proud of.

28:54.396 --> 28:56.564
We can place Charlie
near your house

28:56.598 --> 28:58.132
around the time of his death.

28:58.166 --> 29:00.034
I'm gone most of the day.

29:00.068 --> 29:01.635
I'm working
two minimum wage jobs.

29:01.670 --> 29:04.605
And when I sleep,
I don't hear a thing.

29:04.639 --> 29:07.241
We're gonna have to hold you
until we test the pipe

29:07.275 --> 29:09.043
to see if it's
the murder weapon.

29:10.912 --> 29:13.981
I'd do the same thing
if I were you.

29:23.191 --> 29:24.925
<i>Let's be clear.</i>

29:24.960 --> 29:27.862
We're all riding in a boat
that's destined to sink.

29:27.896 --> 29:30.064
It's the journey
that gives our lives meaning.

29:30.098 --> 29:32.967
We're all flawed.
We could all be better.

29:33.001 --> 29:35.936
But focusing on the negatives,
it merely makes us negative.

29:35.971 --> 29:38.072
My life will be over soon.

29:38.106 --> 29:40.574
But I'm not afraid.

29:40.609 --> 29:42.409
I'm grateful.

29:42.444 --> 29:45.112
Probably not grateful
to be murdered.

29:45.147 --> 29:46.914
He was a wonderful man.

29:46.948 --> 29:49.083
These videos will probably help
a lot of people.

29:49.117 --> 29:50.985
And make his wife
quite wealthy.

29:51.019 --> 29:52.753
Yeah, that, too.

29:52.787 --> 29:54.255
Have you done a scenario?

29:54.289 --> 29:56.223
Yeah.

29:56.258 --> 29:57.858
Was the pipe a match?

29:57.893 --> 30:00.694
Uh, no. I ran a bunch of
different simulations,

30:00.729 --> 30:03.464
and there were no scenarios
where the blows from the pipe

30:03.498 --> 30:06.700
caused the damage
to the victim's skull.

30:06.735 --> 30:08.969
So Lena Silver is
probably not the killer.

30:09.004 --> 30:10.271
Yeah.

30:12.574 --> 30:16.310
Hey, you said you wanted
to help me with my dress.

30:16.344 --> 30:18.812
Yeah.

30:18.847 --> 30:21.849
I want you to look
at something.

30:26.922 --> 30:28.489
Oh, my God.

30:28.523 --> 30:30.224
Where did you get this?

30:30.258 --> 30:35.095
I've had it
since I was eight years old.

30:35.130 --> 30:36.997
You've had this that whole time?

30:37.032 --> 30:42.803
It's the dress I always imagined
I'd wear on my wedding day.

30:45.273 --> 30:48.075
But then I grew up
and my life changed,

30:48.109 --> 30:51.679
and I didn't think about it
until now.

30:55.684 --> 30:58.052
Is it okay?

30:58.086 --> 31:00.321
Yeah, it's perfect.

31:01.489 --> 31:03.557
You might not admit it,

31:03.592 --> 31:06.827
but you're a dreamer.

31:09.164 --> 31:13.334
And this is...
this is your bucket list.

31:15.136 --> 31:17.471
I hope they can make it in time.

31:17.505 --> 31:18.872
Well, they will,

31:18.907 --> 31:21.909
or they'll have to answer to me.

31:21.943 --> 31:25.546
No one messes
with the maid of honor.

31:25.580 --> 31:28.082
I'm so happy for you.

31:32.754 --> 31:34.288
Oh, hey.

31:34.322 --> 31:36.357
So, VAL still thinks
that there's a 96% probability

31:36.391 --> 31:38.025
that Lena Silver
is the prime suspect.

31:38.059 --> 31:39.827
What?!

31:39.861 --> 31:42.830
No! The pipe isn't a match.
My profile completely dismisses

31:42.864 --> 31:44.498
the possibility of her
as the murderer.

31:44.532 --> 31:45.833
I know, I know,

31:45.867 --> 31:47.968
but the department wants us
to factor in VAL

31:48.003 --> 31:50.204
every time we release a suspect.

31:50.238 --> 31:52.072
Seriously?
Yeah, seriously,

31:52.107 --> 31:53.274
Sweets, seriously.

31:54.676 --> 31:56.277
You know what I think
about that?

31:56.311 --> 31:58.379
This is what I think about that.
Kicking it to the curb!

31:58.413 --> 32:00.114
Couldn't you get in trouble
for that?

32:00.148 --> 32:01.615
Look, I don't mind trouble.

32:01.650 --> 32:04.785
But if you're wrong about Lena,
I'm blaming you.

32:04.819 --> 32:06.954
Thank you, Booth. I-I really...

32:06.988 --> 32:08.289
All right, enough.

32:08.323 --> 32:10.124
Don't get all mushy on me, okay?

32:10.158 --> 32:11.925
We still have
a murder to solve.

32:11.960 --> 32:13.260
I hate computers,
always have.

32:13.295 --> 32:15.129
Let's look at some paper.

32:15.163 --> 32:17.865
Charlie McCord's will
was released today.

32:17.899 --> 32:19.967
Look at that.

32:20.001 --> 32:21.335
Oh, wow.

32:21.369 --> 32:23.203
He was splitting
all future income

32:23.238 --> 32:25.339
from his speeches between Lena
and his wife.

32:25.373 --> 32:26.807
And it explains

32:26.841 --> 32:29.143
what his bucket list meant
by "making Lena whole."

32:29.177 --> 32:30.944
Right.

32:30.979 --> 32:33.781
Charlie's wife couldn't have
been too happy about that.

32:35.183 --> 32:38.118
This little guy
is really sick.

32:38.153 --> 32:40.554
There's got to be some kind
of poison in his system.

32:40.588 --> 32:43.123
I'm running a blood culture
and tissue sample.

32:43.158 --> 32:45.025
I studied veterinary science
for two years.

32:45.060 --> 32:47.127
It doesn't appear
to be avian pox.

32:47.162 --> 32:48.329
Bird flu? You're going there?

32:48.363 --> 32:49.596
That's a mutated strain.

32:49.631 --> 32:50.931
I would've thought
you knew that.

32:50.965 --> 32:53.334
Don't start, Dr. Wells.
Sorry.

32:53.368 --> 32:55.502
I just assume people usually
understand basic principles...

32:55.537 --> 32:57.638
Dude, that is "starting."

32:57.672 --> 32:59.273
Now, I found polyethylene,

32:59.307 --> 33:01.075
styrene-butadiene, canvas,

33:01.109 --> 33:04.211
cellulose and synthetic
rubbers inside the rangle,

33:04.245 --> 33:06.125
but nothing in quantities
that would cause this.

33:08.083 --> 33:09.683
Arsenic.

33:09.718 --> 33:11.618
Oh.

33:11.653 --> 33:12.953
Arsenic in the wild?

33:12.987 --> 33:14.888
No. There's no carbon.

33:14.923 --> 33:16.890
It was poison, and
it was in the victim.

33:16.925 --> 33:18.492
That's who the hawk
was feeding on.

33:18.526 --> 33:20.227
The victim was poisoned.

33:20.261 --> 33:22.830
We attributed the porous
bones to chemotherapy...

33:22.864 --> 33:25.065
But Charlie stopped chemotherapy
almost a year ago.

33:25.100 --> 33:26.367
So it was the arsenic

33:26.401 --> 33:27.801
that prevented the bones
from remodeling.

33:27.836 --> 33:30.037
If it was the wife,
she's brilliant.

33:31.206 --> 33:33.240
In a murderous kind of way,
of course.

33:36.676 --> 33:37.943
You must have been
pretty upset when you

33:37.977 --> 33:39.945
found out that Charlie
changed his will.

33:39.979 --> 33:41.380
Why would I be upset?

33:41.414 --> 33:43.512
Because Charlie planned
on leaving Lena Silver

33:43.513 --> 33:45.914
30% of the income generated
from his speeches.

33:45.948 --> 33:47.228
That's, like, a million dollars.

33:47.250 --> 33:49.751
Charlie felt terrible
for the woman.

33:49.785 --> 33:51.386
He said he ruined her life.

33:51.420 --> 33:52.621
She lost her kids.

33:52.655 --> 33:54.623
It's reasonable
for you to think

33:54.657 --> 33:56.525
that money was
yours and not hers.

33:58.394 --> 34:00.495
Have you even watched
any of Charlie's videos?

34:00.530 --> 34:01.630
Yes.

34:01.664 --> 34:03.198
I ordered
the whole series.

34:03.232 --> 34:05.800
Then you know
what kind of man my husband was.

34:05.835 --> 34:08.103
Kind, compassionate, generous.

34:08.137 --> 34:09.670
You ordered the whole series?

34:09.705 --> 34:11.106
I found them
very inspiring, okay?

34:11.139 --> 34:13.175
Look, just because
your husband was a good man

34:13.208 --> 34:15.643
doesn't mean that
you're a good woman.

34:15.678 --> 34:18.179
I wouldn't have taken a second
from Charlie's life.

34:18.214 --> 34:20.382
This world is poorer
for him being gone.

34:20.416 --> 34:23.385
I am amazed that everyone
doesn't feel it, but I do.

34:23.418 --> 34:25.353
And yet, you fed him arsenic.

34:25.388 --> 34:27.188
What?

34:27.223 --> 34:28.657
I did not.

34:28.690 --> 34:30.025
The homeopathic remedies
you gave him.

34:30.059 --> 34:31.493
They were just herbs

34:31.527 --> 34:33.094
and other Ayurvedic remedies.

34:33.129 --> 34:34.728
They contained arsenic.

34:34.764 --> 34:38.800
We found it in his system
when we examined his remains.

34:38.833 --> 34:40.802
But you said that Charlie was
hit on the head.

34:40.835 --> 34:42.237
Well, we're
gonna have to consider

34:42.271 --> 34:44.639
the possibility
that you became impatient.

34:46.609 --> 34:48.376
Oh, my God.

34:48.411 --> 34:50.312
I was just trying
to help him.

34:50.346 --> 34:53.380
I swear, that's all.

34:53.416 --> 34:56.117
I gave him that medicine
to help him.

35:03.226 --> 35:06.895
If you look closely, the
depression fracture to the skull

35:06.929 --> 35:10.465
has a slightly smaller hinge
on the bottom than the top.

35:10.499 --> 35:12.100
That means it came from a blow

35:12.134 --> 35:13.902
that was delivered
with an upward motion.

35:13.936 --> 35:18.340
97% of strikes are by
an overhand motion.

35:18.374 --> 35:20.008
Yeah.

35:20.042 --> 35:23.511
Dr. Brennan, would you like to
grab a coffee with me sometime?

35:23.546 --> 35:26.414
Maybe lunch
or perhaps dinner?

35:27.583 --> 35:29.384
I'd pay.
What you're proposing,

35:29.418 --> 35:30.885
Dr. Wells, is completely
inappropriate.

35:30.920 --> 35:32.320
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

35:32.355 --> 35:34.022
Not like a-a date.

35:34.056 --> 35:36.591
I mean, it's a date,
but not a sexual date.

35:37.893 --> 35:39.761
I-I don't have any friends.

35:39.795 --> 35:41.630
That's because
you're objectionable.

35:41.664 --> 35:43.598
What I'm looking for is
someone that I can have

35:43.633 --> 35:45.300
a conversation with
without shutting down

35:45.334 --> 35:46.701
three quarters of my brain.

35:46.736 --> 35:48.203
I'm tired of being lonely,

35:48.237 --> 35:50.438
and I'm hoping
that you will be that person.

35:50.473 --> 35:51.673
I decline, Dr. Wells.

35:51.707 --> 35:52.774
I don't like you.

35:52.808 --> 35:54.376
So what?
I don't like you either.

35:54.410 --> 35:55.677
What does that
have to do with anything?

35:55.711 --> 35:57.245
The subject is closed.

35:57.280 --> 35:59.781
The victim was struck
by a side-arm motion.

35:59.815 --> 36:01.516
Probably because
the killer

36:01.550 --> 36:03.618
couldn't rotate
his arm from above.

36:03.653 --> 36:05.487
Yes, Dr. Hodgins?

36:05.521 --> 36:07.455
Yes. Yes.

36:07.490 --> 36:09.291
I, uh, I found traces of

36:09.325 --> 36:10.992
cupronickel, uh,
on canvas threads

36:11.027 --> 36:12.594
in the last bit of rangle.

36:12.628 --> 36:14.796
Quarters are made
from cupronickel.

36:14.830 --> 36:16.998
I know what happened.

36:17.033 --> 36:19.668
Oh, my God, I don't.

36:19.702 --> 36:22.003
The canvas was a bank
bag for deposits.

36:22.038 --> 36:23.672
Yeah, for the quarters
they raised for charity.

36:23.706 --> 36:28.209
Martin Proctor struck him with
a bank bag full of quarters.

36:28.244 --> 36:30.545
But what about his alibi?

36:31.814 --> 36:33.615
Martin Proctor's alibi

36:33.649 --> 36:36.751
is this movie ticket
that he just gave to Booth.

36:36.786 --> 36:38.320
Can you prove that he bought it?

36:38.354 --> 36:40.655
Well, there's a confirmation
code on the stub,

36:40.690 --> 36:43.191
and usually the code will link
to a credit card purchase.

36:43.225 --> 36:45.694
But he said he bought
the ticket in cash.

36:45.728 --> 36:47.996
Yeah, and murderers never lie.

36:48.030 --> 36:50.532
We think that Martin Proctor
killed Charlie McCord,

36:50.566 --> 36:52.967
which means he did not
purchase this movie ticket.

36:53.002 --> 36:54.436
Okay.

36:57.573 --> 36:59.107
And you're right.

36:59.141 --> 37:01.943
This was bought by credit
card by someone named

37:01.977 --> 37:03.812
Loraine Nemitz.

37:03.846 --> 37:05.747
He must have fished the ticket
out of the trash.

37:05.781 --> 37:08.016
Martin Proctor
was never at the movies.

37:08.050 --> 37:10.185
He has no alibi.

37:11.253 --> 37:13.254
We know that this is
the deposit bag

37:13.289 --> 37:14.723
you ruckharles McCord with.

37:14.757 --> 37:16.791
I was at a movie.
No, you weren't, okay?

37:16.826 --> 37:19.461
This is not your ticket.

37:19.495 --> 37:23.031
All right? You have no alibi.

37:23.065 --> 37:24.799
Why? Why, Martin?

37:24.834 --> 37:26.401
Charlie was a good guy.

37:26.435 --> 37:28.236
Why'd you kill him?

37:36.846 --> 37:40.615
The videos started
to make some money.

37:40.649 --> 37:42.384
Charlie was paying me
for my time.

37:42.418 --> 37:43.818
Couple hundred bucks
here and there.

37:43.819 --> 37:46.054
And then he told me
that he was gonna give

37:46.088 --> 37:48.623
30% to that lady crook.
Lena Silver.

37:48.657 --> 37:50.959
I went with him
to all of his bucket crap.

37:50.993 --> 37:53.094
I took the videos of
his lectures, cut them together.

37:53.129 --> 37:55.630
I deserved a percentage
of the profits, too.

37:55.664 --> 37:56.831
But Charlie said no.

37:56.866 --> 37:58.366
Maybe he had a good reason.

37:58.401 --> 37:59.968
He did.

38:00.002 --> 38:01.336
Video number six.

38:01.370 --> 38:03.071
The importance of independence,

38:03.105 --> 38:05.006
of being forced
by circumstance

38:05.040 --> 38:06.474
to take care of yourself.

38:06.509 --> 38:07.809
I wanted money,

38:07.843 --> 38:08.843
not a lecture.

38:08.878 --> 38:10.311
Oh, so you killed him?

38:10.346 --> 38:11.413
I hit him.

38:11.447 --> 38:12.580
I-I didn't want him to die.

38:12.615 --> 38:13.615
You know why?

38:13.649 --> 38:15.550
Wait, because he was a good guy?

38:15.584 --> 38:19.988
Because killing him means
I'll never get that money.

38:33.969 --> 38:37.505
♪ Every peace I find

38:37.540 --> 38:39.941
♪ Seems to rise to say...

38:39.975 --> 38:42.577
At the end of the day,
we're all gonna make mistakes.

38:42.611 --> 38:44.646
We're all going to do things
we regret,

38:44.680 --> 38:46.448
even to those we care about.

38:46.482 --> 38:48.216
It's unavoidable.

38:48.250 --> 38:52.187
But at the end, what matters is
how you address your failings.

38:55.624 --> 38:57.792
<i>How you treat your family.</i>

39:01.564 --> 39:03.731
<i>How you treat your friends.</i>

39:08.571 --> 39:10.738
<i>How you forgive.</i>

39:14.643 --> 39:16.744
<i>And how you love.</i>

39:21.217 --> 39:23.618
<i>Oh, and one more thing</i>
<i>I've realized.</i>

39:23.652 --> 39:25.620
<i>You never get</i>
<i>the whole bucket list done.</i>

39:25.654 --> 39:27.522
<i>You just keep</i>
<i>adding things to it,</i>

39:27.556 --> 39:31.759
<i>because every day there's</i>
<i>something new to amaze us.</i>

39:33.629 --> 39:36.831
<i>That's how we know we're alive.</i>

39:38.968 --> 39:40.602
Dr. Wells.

39:40.636 --> 39:42.704
Oh. Hey, Dr. Saroyan.

39:42.738 --> 39:45.907
Uh, I was, uh, I was just...
I was just talking to VAL.

39:45.941 --> 39:49.711
You were, um, talking to VAL?

39:49.745 --> 39:51.246
Yeah, she has the most
amazing sense of humor.

39:51.280 --> 39:53.381
"She."
I asked her, I said, if you're so smart,

39:53.415 --> 39:56.451
what's the greatest lesson
Jesus ever gave us?

39:56.485 --> 39:58.086
And she said that,

39:58.120 --> 40:00.822
"Heaven is like 3x squared

40:00.856 --> 40:02.123
"plus 8x

40:02.157 --> 40:04.225
minus nine."

40:04.260 --> 40:05.827
I have no idea.

40:05.861 --> 40:07.829
That's the equation
for a parabola.

40:07.863 --> 40:08.930
And parabola is funny?

40:08.964 --> 40:09.898
It's a pun.

40:09.932 --> 40:11.099
On the word "parable."

40:12.268 --> 40:14.369
Because Jesus's
greatest wisdom was

40:14.403 --> 40:16.604
handed down in the... Yeah.
In the form of parables.

40:16.639 --> 40:17.906
Guys, I'm ready.

40:17.940 --> 40:19.440
A parabola.

40:19.475 --> 40:21.543
Okay.

40:24.446 --> 40:26.414
What's happening?

40:26.448 --> 40:28.249
VAL is being sent back.

40:28.284 --> 40:31.352
She picked the wrong murderer
and she upset our team dynamics.

40:31.387 --> 40:33.988
Well, th-then the team
is stupid.

40:34.023 --> 40:37.825
Maybe, but it's that kind of
stupidity that makes us so good.

40:37.860 --> 40:40.094
Wait, no, uh, don't take her.

40:40.129 --> 40:41.996
Please. C-Can I buy her?

40:42.031 --> 40:43.164
Can I... can I have her?

40:43.198 --> 40:45.199
Government property.
Please!

40:45.234 --> 40:47.168
This is the most
scintillating conversation...

40:47.202 --> 40:48.536
I'm sorry, Dr. Wells.

40:48.571 --> 40:50.338
No!

40:53.442 --> 40:55.810
<i>So be surprised.</i>

40:55.844 --> 40:57.712
<i>Cherish the time you have.</i>

40:57.746 --> 41:00.815
<i>'Cause every day is a gift.</i>

41:00.849 --> 41:03.084
<i>Every moment a blessing.</i>

41:03.118 --> 41:05.119
I think Christine
has finally gone to sleep.

41:05.154 --> 41:06.287
Shh, shh.

41:06.322 --> 41:08.289
Why? It doesn't
work both ways.

41:08.324 --> 41:10.258
No, no, I don't
think that's true.

41:10.292 --> 41:12.794
I swear she knows
when we relax.

41:12.828 --> 41:13.795
Just put it down.

41:13.829 --> 41:14.862
All right.

41:14.897 --> 41:15.997
Shh-shh-shh-shh.

41:16.031 --> 41:17.932
There you go. Okay.

41:17.967 --> 41:20.602
Bones, you got nothing
on your list there.

41:20.636 --> 41:22.537
Well, you've written down
ten things.

41:22.571 --> 41:24.472
Yeah.

41:24.506 --> 41:26.608
Come on, there's got to be
at least a hundred things

41:26.642 --> 41:28.076
you want to do
before you die.

41:28.110 --> 41:29.811
I don't know.

41:29.845 --> 41:31.613
I'm very happy.

41:31.647 --> 41:36.351
I have a very good job
that I enjoy, a lovely home,

41:36.385 --> 41:38.486
a healthy and smart child...

41:38.520 --> 41:39.887
Yeah, but...

41:39.922 --> 41:41.889
And I love the man
I'm going to marry.

41:41.924 --> 41:43.024
That is pretty good.

41:43.058 --> 41:44.325
Pretty good.

41:44.360 --> 41:46.327
I mean, if I were you,
and I had me,

41:46.362 --> 41:48.696
I wouldn't write anything down
on a list either.

41:49.932 --> 41:50.965
You're teasing me.

41:51.000 --> 41:52.367
I am.

41:54.269 --> 41:56.571
But look at you.

41:59.041 --> 42:02.677
You know, this...
these are just little things.

42:02.711 --> 42:04.712
You know, where I want to go,
you know,

42:04.747 --> 42:06.614
climb things, go to
outer space, huh?

42:06.649 --> 42:09.083
What, lean on the
Tower of Pisa?

42:12.955 --> 42:14.889
Did you get your tuxedo?

42:14.923 --> 42:16.591
I will.
We should probably

42:16.625 --> 42:19.193
decide where we want
to have our reception.

42:19.566 --> 42:21.066
Founding Fathers.

42:21.601 --> 42:23.668
Great free wings.

42:23.703 --> 42:25.203
Oh, a better place obviously.

42:25.238 --> 42:27.205
We don't get
married every day;

42:27.240 --> 42:30.408
our wedding shouldn't
feel like an everyday thing.

42:30.443 --> 42:34.012
I love every day.

42:37.783 --> 42:39.617
Hold on, turn
that thing off.

42:39.651 --> 42:41.519
What? I'm not...
She can't see.
