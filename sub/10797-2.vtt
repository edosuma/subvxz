<i>Captain's Log,</i>

00:05.000 --> 00:09.041
<i>Stardate 41209.2:</i>

00:09.041 --> 00:10.709
<i>We are running at warp 7</i>

00:10.709 --> 00:12.417
<i>to rendezvous</i>

00:10.709 --> 00:12.417
<i>with the science vessel</i>

00:12.417 --> 00:14.667
<i>S.S.</i> Tsiolkovsky--

00:14.667 --> 00:16.750
<i>which has been routinely</i>

00:14.667 --> 00:16.750
<i>monitoring the collapse</i>

00:16.750 --> 00:19.959
<i>of a red supergiant star</i>

00:16.750 --> 00:19.959
<i>into a white dwarf.</i>

00:19.959 --> 00:21.959
<i>What has brought us here</i>

00:21.959 --> 00:24.000
<i>is a series of strange messages</i>

00:24.000 --> 00:26.083
<i>indicating something</i>

00:24.000 --> 00:26.083
<i>has gone wrong</i>

00:26.083 --> 00:28.083
<i>aboard the research vessel.</i>

00:29.083 --> 00:32.333
(<i> party noises</i> )

00:32.333 --> 00:36.000
S.S.<i> Tsiolkovsky,</i>

00:32.333 --> 00:36.000
repeat your message.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.250
FEMALE:

00:36.000 --> 00:38.250
Well, hello,<i> Enterprise.</i>

00:38.250 --> 00:39.625
Welcome.

00:39.625 --> 00:41.583
I hope you have a lot

00:39.625 --> 00:41.583
of pretty boys onboard

00:41.583 --> 00:44.208
because I'm willing

00:41.583 --> 00:44.208
and waiting

00:44.208 --> 00:48.208
if in fact, we're going to have

00:44.208 --> 00:48.208
a real blowout here.

00:48.208 --> 00:51.542
(<i> wild party sounds</i> )

00:51.542 --> 00:52.750
MALE:

00:51.542 --> 00:52.750
Do it! Yeah, go ahead.

00:52.750 --> 00:55.166
(<i> laughing</i> ):

00:52.750 --> 00:55.166
Do it!

00:55.166 --> 00:57.041
(<i> explosion</i> )

01:01.291 --> 01:05.875
Captain, what we've just

01:01.291 --> 01:05.875
heard is... impossible.

01:05.875 --> 01:07.458
Report.

01:07.458 --> 01:09.667
I believe

01:07.458 --> 01:09.667
that last sound

01:09.667 --> 01:12.291
was an emergency

01:09.667 --> 01:12.291
hatch being blown.

01:12.291 --> 01:13.875
Are you certain?

01:13.875 --> 01:15.792
Yes, of course you are.

01:16.875 --> 01:19.083
Data, Geordi, Tasha.

01:21.667 --> 01:23.667
Sensor scans now reveal

01:23.667 --> 01:26.041
no life signs

01:23.667 --> 01:26.041
aboard, Captain.

01:48.750 --> 01:51.750
(<i> alarm blaring</i> )

01:51.750 --> 01:54.208
Cover the ship

01:51.750 --> 01:54.208
as planned.

01:54.208 --> 01:55.375
Move out.

02:14.166 --> 02:19.500
Indications of what humans

02:14.166 --> 02:19.500
would call... a wild party.

02:19.500 --> 02:20.834
Yeah.

02:20.834 --> 02:22.375
(<i> electrical fritzing</i> )

02:24.500 --> 02:26.333
Their Bridge.

02:26.333 --> 02:30.625
If this thing works,

02:26.333 --> 02:30.625
be sure to record everything.

02:35.458 --> 02:36.875
You were right.

02:36.875 --> 02:38.875
Somebody blew out the hatch.

02:38.875 --> 02:41.125
They were all sucked out

02:38.875 --> 02:41.125
into space.

02:41.125 --> 02:45.083
Correction, sir--

02:41.125 --> 02:45.083
that's blown out.

02:45.083 --> 02:46.583
Thank you, Data.

02:46.583 --> 02:48.458
A common mistake, sir.

02:48.458 --> 02:51.959
Commander Riker, Lieutenant Yar,

02:48.458 --> 02:51.959
location engineering.

02:51.959 --> 02:53.750
Ten people here, sir,

02:51.959 --> 02:53.750
all frozen.

02:53.750 --> 02:56.250
No vital signs.

02:56.250 --> 02:57.792
Frozen? How?

02:57.792 --> 02:59.750
Looks like someone

02:57.792 --> 02:59.750
has been playing

02:59.750 --> 03:01.667
with the environmental

02:59.750 --> 03:01.667
controls, sir.

03:01.667 --> 03:05.291
Just let all the heat

03:01.667 --> 03:05.291
bleed away into space.

03:06.709 --> 03:08.792
(<i> shivers</i> )

03:08.792 --> 03:13.333
Sir, Lieutenant La Forge

03:08.792 --> 03:13.333
in the crew quarters.

03:13.333 --> 03:15.166
There's something in here.

03:21.250 --> 03:23.750
(<i> rhythmic banging</i> )

03:43.041 --> 03:45.291
(<i> high-pitched whooshing</i> )

03:46.959 --> 03:50.166
Riker to Captain,

03:46.959 --> 03:50.166
I have a report for you, sir.

03:50.166 --> 03:51.625
Picard here.

03:51.625 --> 03:53.333
They're all dead.

03:53.333 --> 03:57.250
Apparently some of them were

03:53.333 --> 03:57.250
blown out the emergency hatches.

03:57.250 --> 04:00.041
But there were 80 people

03:57.250 --> 04:00.041
on that ship, Number One.

04:00.041 --> 04:01.500
Yes, sir.

04:01.500 --> 04:04.000
As I said...

04:04.000 --> 04:05.917
all dead.

04:28.000 --> 04:32.834
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

04:32.834 --> 04:36.625
<i>These are the voyages</i>

04:32.834 --> 04:36.625
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

04:36.625 --> 04:38.792
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

04:38.792 --> 04:42.625
<i>to explore</i>

04:38.792 --> 04:42.625
<i>strange new worlds,</i>

04:42.625 --> 04:47.333
<i>to seek out new life</i>

04:42.625 --> 04:47.333
<i>and new civilizations,</i>

04:47.333 --> 04:50.792
<i>to boldly go</i>

04:47.333 --> 04:50.792
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

05:53.500 --> 05:55.417
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental:</i>

05:55.417 --> 05:57.500
<i>We are downloading</i>

05:55.417 --> 05:57.500
<i>the research information</i>

05:57.500 --> 06:00.542
<i>gathered on</i>

05:57.500 --> 06:00.542
<i>the collapsing star nearby.</i>

06:00.542 --> 06:02.875
<i>I am concerned at being</i>

06:00.542 --> 06:02.875
<i>in such close orbit</i>

06:02.875 --> 06:04.959
<i>but the</i> Tsiolkovsky's<i> </i>

06:02.875 --> 06:04.959
<i>research records</i>

06:04.959 --> 06:10.500
<i>will no doubt predict the time</i>

06:04.959 --> 06:10.500
<i>of the star's final collapse.</i>

06:10.500 --> 06:12.458
I can't find

06:10.500 --> 06:12.458
anything unusual

06:12.458 --> 06:15.250
in any of the tricorder readings

06:12.458 --> 06:15.250
they sent over, Captain.

06:15.250 --> 06:17.166
Give me a theory, Doctor.

06:17.166 --> 06:18.667
Anything.

06:18.667 --> 06:20.208
Madness?

06:20.208 --> 06:21.291
Mass hysteria?

06:21.291 --> 06:22.959
Delusion?

06:22.959 --> 06:26.083
Any, or all, Captain.

06:27.709 --> 06:31.291
All right, let's bring

06:27.709 --> 06:31.291
the away team back.

06:31.291 --> 06:32.709
Set the transporter

06:32.709 --> 06:34.834
to maximum

06:32.709 --> 06:34.834
decontamination

06:34.834 --> 06:36.750
and then full

06:34.834 --> 06:36.750
examination

06:36.750 --> 06:39.208
and observation

06:36.750 --> 06:39.208
when they're here.

06:45.208 --> 06:46.959
If you were

06:45.208 --> 06:46.959
any more perfect, Data

06:46.959 --> 06:48.458
I'd have to write you up

06:48.458 --> 06:50.250
in a Starfleet Medical

06:48.458 --> 06:50.250
textbook.

06:50.250 --> 06:54.250
I'm already listed in several

06:50.250 --> 06:54.250
biomechanical texts, Doctor.

06:54.250 --> 06:56.750
Yes, of course.

06:56.750 --> 06:59.166
You're next, Lieutenant.

06:59.166 --> 07:01.375
(<i> beeping</i> )

07:13.041 --> 07:15.500
Normal all across.

07:17.709 --> 07:21.083
Except... why are you

07:17.709 --> 07:21.083
perspiring, Lieutenant?

07:21.083 --> 07:23.917
I suppose because<i> you</i>

07:21.083 --> 07:23.917
have it too hot in here.

07:23.917 --> 07:26.375
What else

07:23.917 --> 07:26.375
would it be?

07:26.375 --> 07:27.834
That doesn't sound

07:26.375 --> 07:27.834
like you, Geordi.

07:27.834 --> 07:30.250
Well, maybe it's not.

07:30.250 --> 07:32.208
Maybe she threw her voice.

07:34.458 --> 07:37.041
Hey, it was a joke.

07:37.041 --> 07:40.166
Of course, but I

07:37.041 --> 07:40.166
would like to run

07:40.166 --> 07:43.959
one or two more tests

07:40.166 --> 07:43.959
on you, Lieutenant.

07:43.959 --> 07:46.000
(<i> sighing</i> )

07:48.083 --> 07:49.583
Sick Bay to Bridge.

07:49.583 --> 07:51.458
Picard here.

07:49.583 --> 07:51.458
Go ahead, Doctor.

07:51.458 --> 07:53.834
I'm confining

07:51.458 --> 07:53.834
Lieutenant La Forge to Sick Bay

07:53.834 --> 07:55.041
until further notice.

07:55.041 --> 07:56.834
Do we have a problem, Doctor?

07:56.834 --> 07:58.625
I don't know yet.

08:00.333 --> 08:02.542
Data, I need help

08:02.542 --> 08:04.959
in locating some library

08:02.542 --> 08:04.959
computer information.

08:04.959 --> 08:06.375
Specifics, sir?

08:06.375 --> 08:08.875
All I have is a vague memory

08:06.375 --> 08:08.875
of reading somewhere

08:08.875 --> 08:11.917
about someone taking a shower

08:08.875 --> 08:11.917
in his or her clothing.

08:11.917 --> 08:14.917
Ah, the body Geordi discovered.

08:14.917 --> 08:16.583
Well, I believe

08:14.917 --> 08:16.583
it may have happened before.

08:16.583 --> 08:19.959
To someone, somewhere.

08:19.959 --> 08:21.333
This ought to be easy

08:21.333 --> 08:23.417
for someone written up

08:21.333 --> 08:23.417
in biomechanical texts.

08:26.083 --> 08:28.000
About that, sir.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.709
Did the Doctor

08:28.000 --> 08:30.709
believe I was boasting?

08:30.709 --> 08:32.041
Probably.

08:32.041 --> 08:33.875
This may take some time?

08:33.875 --> 08:35.458
At least several hours.

08:35.458 --> 08:38.208
But what I said was

08:35.458 --> 08:38.208
a statement of fact.

08:38.208 --> 08:39.792
Perhaps she will look it up.

08:39.792 --> 08:43.667
You can depend on it.

09:41.875 --> 09:43.333
Geordi!

09:49.000 --> 09:51.333
Security, Lieutenant La Forge

09:49.000 --> 09:51.333
just left Sick Bay

09:51.333 --> 09:52.583
while I was in my office.

09:52.583 --> 09:54.792
He doesn't have

09:52.583 --> 09:54.792
his communicator.

09:54.792 --> 09:57.625
It is very important

09:54.792 --> 09:57.625
that we find him.

09:57.625 --> 09:58.792
Security team alert.

09:58.792 --> 10:00.291
Pick up Lieutenant

09:58.792 --> 10:00.291
La Forge.

10:00.291 --> 10:01.625
He just left Sick

10:00.291 --> 10:01.625
Bay moments ago.

10:01.625 --> 10:03.333
Captain,

10:01.625 --> 10:03.333
anything further?

10:03.333 --> 10:04.667
Affirmative.

10:04.667 --> 10:08.709
Make it a shipwide

10:04.667 --> 10:08.709
search, Lieutenant.

10:32.250 --> 10:35.041
It's a model of the same kind

10:32.250 --> 10:35.041
of tractor beam our ship uses--

10:35.041 --> 10:37.083
with a few ideas

10:35.041 --> 10:37.083
of my own added.

10:37.083 --> 10:39.083
So that's your

10:37.083 --> 10:39.083
science project, huh?

10:39.083 --> 10:41.125
Wes, you're

10:39.083 --> 10:41.125
really something.

10:41.125 --> 10:43.792
And since the Captain

10:41.125 --> 10:43.792
won't let me on the Bridge,

10:43.792 --> 10:46.166
I use this to imagine

10:43.792 --> 10:46.166
I'm there.

10:46.166 --> 10:49.792
PICARD:

10:46.166 --> 10:49.792
Take the helm, Mr. Crusher.

10:49.792 --> 10:53.917
Set a course for 37 mark 180,

10:49.792 --> 10:53.917
warp 6.

10:53.917 --> 10:55.792
That's the Captain's voice.

10:55.792 --> 10:58.458
It's pieced together from words

10:55.792 --> 10:58.458
he's used on the intercom.

10:58.458 --> 11:00.000
With this,

10:58.458 --> 11:00.000
I can pretend

11:00.000 --> 11:01.667
he's ordering me to take

11:00.000 --> 11:01.667
the<i> Enterprise</i> anywhere

11:01.667 --> 11:03.333
and listen to this.

11:03.333 --> 11:05.417
Chief Engineer,

11:03.333 --> 11:05.417
report to the Bridge.

11:05.417 --> 11:07.792
Commander Riker, report to the

11:05.417 --> 11:07.792
Bridge.

11:07.792 --> 11:10.792
Dr. Crusher,

11:07.792 --> 11:10.792
report to the Bridge.

11:10.792 --> 11:12.333
What do you think?

11:12.333 --> 11:15.458
I think the Captain's

11:12.333 --> 11:15.458
lucky you're on his side.

11:15.458 --> 11:18.542
But he still won't let me

11:15.458 --> 11:18.542
on the Bridge

11:18.542 --> 11:21.125
and there's nothing there

11:18.542 --> 11:21.125
I don't understand.

11:21.125 --> 11:25.125
I wish I understood

11:21.125 --> 11:25.125
myself that well.

11:25.125 --> 11:26.959
Are you okay?

11:26.959 --> 11:33.125
No, suddenly I seem to

11:26.959 --> 11:33.125
be burning up inside.

11:33.125 --> 11:35.208
(<i> sighing</i> )

11:35.208 --> 11:37.834
It's so hot in here!

11:46.542 --> 11:47.792
Geordi.

11:53.458 --> 11:54.709
Geordi!

11:56.250 --> 11:58.875
Lieutenant Yar in

11:56.250 --> 11:58.875
the observation lounge.

11:58.875 --> 12:00.750
Send a team here now.

12:00.750 --> 12:02.417
Medical's been

12:00.750 --> 12:02.417
worried about you.

12:02.417 --> 12:03.542
Help me.

12:03.542 --> 12:05.792
Help me to

12:03.542 --> 12:05.792
not give in

12:05.792 --> 12:08.291
to the wild things

12:05.792 --> 12:08.291
coming into my mind.

12:08.291 --> 12:10.583
Geordi, my job is security.

12:10.583 --> 12:13.041
Tasha, please.

12:14.834 --> 12:17.375
All right.

12:17.375 --> 12:18.959
All right.

12:17.375 --> 12:18.959
Helping is more important.

12:18.959 --> 12:21.542
Geordi, how can I help you?

12:21.542 --> 12:24.792
Help me to see

12:21.542 --> 12:24.792
like you do.

12:24.792 --> 12:27.667
But you already see

12:24.792 --> 12:27.667
better than I can.

12:27.667 --> 12:29.375
I see more.

12:31.875 --> 12:35.583
But more isn't better.

12:35.583 --> 12:37.583
Geordi, please

12:35.583 --> 12:37.583
put these back...

12:37.583 --> 12:39.750
I want to see

12:37.583 --> 12:39.750
in shallow, dim,

12:39.750 --> 12:45.041
beautiful, human ways.

12:51.083 --> 12:54.667
We'll talk about it, Geordi.

12:54.667 --> 12:57.000
Right now I'm going

12:54.667 --> 12:57.000
to take you to Sick Bay.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.667
All right?

12:59.875 --> 13:01.500
Yeah.

13:01.500 --> 13:03.333
Okay.

13:05.875 --> 13:07.250
Good.

13:15.792 --> 13:17.583
And then we got him down

13:15.792 --> 13:17.583
to Sick Bay

13:17.583 --> 13:19.875
so Dr. Crusher

13:17.583 --> 13:19.875
could examine him.

13:19.875 --> 13:23.000
He wasn't violent?

13:23.000 --> 13:25.291
No, sir.

13:25.291 --> 13:26.667
He was very upset.

13:26.667 --> 13:29.458
He kept talking about

13:26.667 --> 13:29.458
wanting normal vision.

13:29.458 --> 13:32.417
Hmm.

13:29.458 --> 13:32.417
Thank you, Lieutenant.

13:34.583 --> 13:37.792
(<i> sighing</i> )

13:46.917 --> 13:49.000
According to our

13:46.917 --> 13:49.000
medical readouts

13:49.000 --> 13:50.500
there's still nothing wrong

13:49.000 --> 13:50.500
with him.

13:50.500 --> 13:52.417
He looks like he's

13:50.500 --> 13:52.417
running a temperature

13:52.417 --> 13:54.208
but every instrument we have

13:52.417 --> 13:54.208
says he's not.

13:54.208 --> 13:57.166
Doctor, every person

13:54.208 --> 13:57.166
on that ship over there died.

13:57.166 --> 13:58.375
Is there any chance

13:58.375 --> 14:02.500
that whatever did it

13:58.375 --> 14:02.500
is loose on my ship?

14:02.500 --> 14:05.000
If you mean a disease, sir,

14:02.500 --> 14:05.000
I'd say there's no chance of it.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
We used full

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
decontamination.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.375
We examined every team member

14:07.000 --> 14:09.375
very carefully.

14:09.375 --> 14:13.458
The entire crew somehow managed

14:09.375 --> 14:13.458
to kill themselves, Doctor.

14:13.458 --> 14:16.667
If it's not a disease,

14:13.458 --> 14:16.667
what else made them do it?

14:16.667 --> 14:19.083
The obvious alternatives

14:16.667 --> 14:19.083
are in the areas of insanity

14:19.083 --> 14:21.166
and severe emotional upset.

14:21.166 --> 14:23.000
Troi, do you feel anything

14:23.000 --> 14:24.834
unusual in

14:23.000 --> 14:24.834
the Lieutenant?

14:24.834 --> 14:28.750
Security just told me

14:24.834 --> 14:28.750
that he was longing

14:24.834 --> 14:28.750
for normal sight.

14:28.750 --> 14:30.875
That's a sudden

14:28.750 --> 14:30.875
yearning for that.

14:30.875 --> 14:33.417
Since his records show

14:30.875 --> 14:33.417
no previous mention of that,

14:33.417 --> 14:36.000
the fact that it happened

14:33.417 --> 14:36.000
now could be important.

14:36.000 --> 14:40.625
But all I sense from him

14:36.000 --> 14:40.625
is confusion.

14:40.625 --> 14:43.875
If I didn't know better,

14:40.625 --> 14:43.875
I'd say he was intoxicated.

14:43.875 --> 14:45.917
Our tests would have

14:43.875 --> 14:45.917
shown that--

14:45.917 --> 14:48.000
also any other signs of drugs,

14:45.917 --> 14:48.000
hallucinogens,

14:48.000 --> 14:49.417
or any other contaminants.

14:52.125 --> 14:54.750
(<i> sighing</i> )

15:04.166 --> 15:06.166
Can you provide

15:04.166 --> 15:06.166
more information, sir?

15:06.166 --> 15:08.083
Seeking an instance

15:08.083 --> 15:10.542
of someone showering

15:08.083 --> 15:10.542
in his or her clothing is...

15:10.542 --> 15:13.959
I know. It's like looking

15:10.542 --> 15:13.959
for a needle in a haystack.

15:13.959 --> 15:18.250
Why should anyone

15:13.959 --> 15:18.250
wish to expend his

15:13.959 --> 15:18.250
time in such a search?

15:18.250 --> 15:20.208
Correction, Data.

15:18.250 --> 15:20.208
I should have said

15:20.208 --> 15:22.333
<i>proverbial</i> needle

15:20.208 --> 15:22.333
in a haystack.

15:22.333 --> 15:23.625
A human proverb--

15:23.625 --> 15:25.792
as in folklore

15:23.625 --> 15:25.792
or an historical allusion

15:25.792 --> 15:27.000
or tribal memories.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.166
Historical. That's it.

15:28.166 --> 15:29.792
I remember I was reading

15:28.166 --> 15:29.792
a history

15:29.792 --> 15:32.041
of all the past starships

15:29.792 --> 15:32.041
named<i> Enterprise.</i>

15:32.041 --> 15:33.208
<i>Enterprise</i> history.

15:33.208 --> 15:35.208
Aberrant behavior.

15:35.208 --> 15:36.792
Medical cross-reference.

15:36.792 --> 15:38.875
Captain, I believe

15:36.792 --> 15:38.875
we have the answer

15:38.875 --> 15:40.959
to what happened

15:38.875 --> 15:40.959
over there.

15:44.750 --> 15:47.166
The Constitution-class

15:44.750 --> 15:47.166
Starship<i> Enterprise</i>

15:47.166 --> 15:49.625
Captain James T. Kirk,

15:47.166 --> 15:49.625
commanding.

15:49.625 --> 15:51.083
Similar conditions.

15:51.083 --> 15:54.041
They were monitoring

15:51.083 --> 15:54.041
a planet that was breaking up

15:54.041 --> 15:56.375
and not a collapsing star,

15:54.041 --> 15:56.375
as in this case.

15:56.375 --> 15:58.959
But there were the same

15:56.375 --> 15:58.959
huge shifts in gravity.

15:58.959 --> 16:00.291
Which somehow resulted

16:00.291 --> 16:02.709
in complex strings

16:00.291 --> 16:02.709
of water molecules

16:02.709 --> 16:05.166
which acquired carbon

16:02.709 --> 16:05.166
from the body

16:05.166 --> 16:09.834
and acted...

16:05.166 --> 16:09.834
acted on the brain like alcohol.

16:09.834 --> 16:14.041

Aye, sir.

Downloading.

16:16.291 --> 16:17.959
Fascinating.

16:17.959 --> 16:21.583
The entire crew

16:17.959 --> 16:21.583
going out of control.

16:21.583 --> 16:23.291
Like intoxication,

16:21.583 --> 16:23.291
but worse.

16:23.291 --> 16:26.625
Judgment almost

16:23.291 --> 16:26.625
completely impaired.

16:26.625 --> 16:31.000
Until they found this formula,

16:26.625 --> 16:31.000
barely in time.

16:32.625 --> 16:34.583
Picard to Dr. Crusher.

16:32.625 --> 16:34.583
Come in.

16:34.583 --> 16:37.041
This is Crusher.

16:34.583 --> 16:37.041
Go ahead, Captain.

16:37.041 --> 16:38.542
You can relax, Doctor.

16:38.542 --> 16:40.000
The answer to all of this

16:40.000 --> 16:42.250
is feeding into

16:40.000 --> 16:42.250
your medical banks right now--

16:42.250 --> 16:43.667
including a cure.

16:43.667 --> 16:45.417
Are you certain, Captain?

16:45.417 --> 16:47.458
Absolutely.

16:55.709 --> 16:56.917
(<i> laughter</i> )

16:56.917 --> 16:58.083
Tasha?

17:00.625 --> 17:02.083
What are

17:00.625 --> 17:02.083
you doing?

17:02.083 --> 17:03.750
I need your advice.

17:03.750 --> 17:07.000
That's why I came

17:03.750 --> 17:07.000
to your quarters.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.041
Of course. Anything...

17:08.041 --> 17:09.667
On clothes.

17:09.667 --> 17:12.083
You always wear

17:09.667 --> 17:12.083
such beautiful clothes off duty.

17:12.083 --> 17:16.583
And your hair always

17:12.083 --> 17:16.583
looks so nice.

17:16.583 --> 17:18.458
I want to change my image.

17:18.458 --> 17:21.041
What do you think

17:18.458 --> 17:21.041
about this?

17:21.041 --> 17:23.000
Or this one?

17:24.417 --> 17:27.583
It's not for you.

17:27.583 --> 17:29.709
Tasha...

17:29.709 --> 17:31.959
I feel you're very uncertain.

17:31.959 --> 17:33.709
That you're fighting something.

(<i> high-pitched whooshing</i> )

17:35.041 --> 17:36.834

Never mind.

17:39.792 --> 17:43.250
I'll find what

17:39.792 --> 17:43.250
I need myself.

17:43.250 --> 17:45.542
Ship's stores

17:43.250 --> 17:45.542
will have it.

17:50.333 --> 17:51.583
Tasha.

Tasha, wait!

Troi to Captain Picard.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.458
Picard here.

17:58.458 --> 18:02.000
Sir, I think

17:58.458 --> 18:02.000
Tasha's been infected, too.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.417
She just left my quarters.

18:04.417 --> 18:06.834
Counselor, it's not

18:04.417 --> 18:06.834
actually an infection.

18:06.834 --> 18:09.917
Yes, sir, it's more

18:06.834 --> 18:09.917
like an intoxication

18:09.917 --> 18:13.667
but whatever it is,

18:09.917 --> 18:13.667
she's got it.

18:13.667 --> 18:15.667
Thank you, Counselor.

18:17.667 --> 18:19.041
Number One

18:19.041 --> 18:20.750
it seems our

18:19.041 --> 18:20.750
security chief

18:20.750 --> 18:22.959
has the equivalent

18:20.750 --> 18:22.959
of a snootful.

18:22.959 --> 18:24.625
Inquiry, sir.

18:24.625 --> 18:27.500
Snootful?

18:29.667 --> 18:31.000
Forget it.

18:42.041 --> 18:44.417
Hey, Mom, look

18:42.041 --> 18:44.417
what I can do.

18:53.208 --> 18:55.667
I've been able to widen

18:53.208 --> 18:55.667
and strengthen the beam--

18:55.667 --> 18:57.834
just like I told

18:55.667 --> 18:57.834
you last night.

18:57.834 --> 18:59.208
Do me a favor, Wes.

18:59.208 --> 19:01.834
There's something

18:59.208 --> 19:01.834
happening on this ship.

19:01.834 --> 19:03.625
Just to be safe,

I'd like you to stay

19:03.625 --> 19:05.417
in our quarters

19:03.625 --> 19:05.417
until it's solved.

19:05.417 --> 19:06.500
Sure, Mom, sure.

Your wish is my command.

19:08.542 --> 19:10.208
<i>Now,</i> Wes.

19:10.208 --> 19:13.500
Okay, but you could be

anyway?

Crusher here.

Have you made

19:23.333 --> 19:26.166
a test injection yet?

19:26.166 --> 19:29.166
We're getting indications that

19:26.166 --> 19:29.166
this condition is spreading.

19:29.166 --> 19:32.917
No test yet, Captain,

19:29.166 --> 19:32.917
but very soon.

Slow, sir?

20:05.583 --> 20:09.667
The<i> Tsiolkovsky</i> has been

20:05.583 --> 20:09.667
eight months in accumulating it.

20:09.667 --> 20:13.083
How much danger from that star--

20:09.667 --> 20:13.083
worst case?

20:13.083 --> 20:16.208
Like a full collapse, sir?

20:16.208 --> 20:18.375
Any stellar material

20:16.208 --> 20:18.375
it threw this way

20:18.375 --> 20:20.917
we could still outrun

20:18.375 --> 20:20.917
on half impulse power.

20:30.250 --> 20:32.208
Picard to Engineering.

20:32.208 --> 20:35.000
Chief Engineer,

20:32.208 --> 20:35.000
report to the Bridge.

Shimoda, report to Medical.

20:50.750 --> 20:52.083
Hi, Jim.

20:52.083 --> 20:54.792
Was that the Captain

20:52.083 --> 20:54.792
ordering you to Medical?

20:54.792 --> 20:57.000
Which would leave

20:54.792 --> 20:57.000
no one here on duty.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.083
The Chief was just

20:57.000 --> 20:59.083
summoned to the Bridge.

20:59.083 --> 21:00.458
What about me?

21:00.458 --> 21:02.542
I could call the

21:00.458 --> 21:02.542
Chief on the Bridge

21:02.542 --> 21:04.834
if anything happened.

21:17.041 --> 21:18.917
Reporting as ordered, sir.

21:18.917 --> 21:20.875
What?

21:20.875 --> 21:23.750
You ordered me to report

21:20.875 --> 21:23.750
to the Bridge, sir.

21:23.750 --> 21:24.959
I did no such thing.

21:24.959 --> 21:26.458
I want you down

21:24.959 --> 21:26.458
in the engine room

21:26.458 --> 21:28.834

to move out of here.

21:28.834 --> 21:31.583
Attention, all decks

21:31.583 --> 21:32.917
all divisions.

21:32.917 --> 21:34.333
Effective immediately

21:34.333 --> 21:36.583
I have handed over

21:34.333 --> 21:36.583
control of this vessel

21:36.583 --> 21:38.834
to acting Captain

21:36.583 --> 21:38.834
Wesley Crusher.

21:40.291 --> 21:42.208
Acting Captain?!

21:42.208 --> 21:44.542
WESLEY:

21:42.208 --> 21:44.542
Thank you, Captain Picard,

21:42.208 --> 21:44.542
thank you.

21:44.542 --> 21:46.917
And with that order

21:44.542 --> 21:46.917
dawns a brave new day

21:46.917 --> 21:48.208
for the<i> Enterprise.</i>

21:55.000 --> 21:58.750
<i>Captain's Log,</i>

21:55.000 --> 21:58.750
<i>Stardate 41209.3:</i>

21:58.750 --> 22:02.208
<i>The strange contaminant</i>

21:58.750 --> 22:02.208

22:05.709 --> 22:07.417

22:07.417 --> 22:09.709

22:07.417 --> 22:09.709
<i>by young Wesley Crusher.</i>

22:09.709 --> 22:12.542
And henceforth

22:12.542 --> 22:18.166
a dessert course shall

22:12.542 --> 22:18.166
precede and follow every meal

22:18.166 --> 22:20.125
including breakfast.

22:20.125 --> 22:21.917
Hooray for the

22:20.125 --> 22:21.917
acting captain!

22:21.917 --> 22:26.625
Never got as far

22:21.917 --> 22:26.625
as Sick Bay, Wes.

22:26.625 --> 22:28.500
I feel too good for that.

22:28.500 --> 22:32.834
(<i> laughter</i> )

22:35.166 --> 22:37.625
Incredible!

22:37.625 --> 22:39.333
How did you do that?

22:39.333 --> 22:42.250
Hooked my model tractor beam

22:39.333 --> 22:42.250
into ship's power.

22:42.250 --> 22:44.375
Now it's a repulser beam, too.

22:44.375 --> 22:46.083
Want in?

22:46.083 --> 22:50.041
Swear to be faithful to you,

22:46.083 --> 22:50.041
Captain.

23:02.917 --> 23:05.792
Number One, MacDougal, get

23:02.917 --> 23:05.792
that boy out of Engineering.

23:08.625 --> 23:10.083
Sir.

23:10.083 --> 23:13.667
I'm getting very strange

23:10.083 --> 23:13.667
reports from all decks.

23:13.667 --> 23:15.583
Such as?

23:15.583 --> 23:17.959
Such as the ship's training

23:15.583 --> 23:17.959
division ordering all officers

23:17.959 --> 23:19.709
to attend a lecture

23:17.959 --> 23:19.709
on metaphysics.

23:19.709 --> 23:21.041
Metaphysics?

23:21.041 --> 23:22.375
Confirmed, sir.

23:22.375 --> 23:25.208
And there was

23:22.375 --> 23:25.208
a rather peculiar limerick

23:25.208 --> 23:28.959
being delivered by someone

23:25.208 --> 23:28.959
in the shuttlecraft bay.

23:28.959 --> 23:32.542
I am not sure

23:28.959 --> 23:32.542
I understand it.

23:32.542 --> 23:35.750
"There was a young lady

23:32.542 --> 23:35.750
from Venus

23:35.750 --> 23:37.917
whose body was

23:35.750 --> 23:37.917
shaped like a..."

23:37.917 --> 23:40.083
Captain to Security, come in!

23:40.083 --> 23:42.917
Did I say something wrong?

23:42.917 --> 23:45.083
I don't understand

23:42.917 --> 23:45.083
their humor either.

23:45.083 --> 23:46.709
Yeah, Captain.

23:46.709 --> 23:48.709
Where is my security chief?!

23:46.709 --> 23:48.709
Get me Lieutenant Yar!

23:48.709 --> 23:51.000
Keep your britches on.

23:51.000 --> 23:52.667
YAR:

23:51.000 --> 23:52.667
Captain Picard.

23:52.667 --> 23:53.709
Lieutenant, where are you?

23:53.709 --> 23:55.667
I'm in my quarters

23:55.667 --> 23:59.709
and, um... I'm pretty busy

23:55.667 --> 23:59.709
right at the moment,

23:59.709 --> 24:03.166
Jean-Luc.

24:03.166 --> 24:07.166
All right, Lieutenant,

24:03.166 --> 24:07.166
you just stay right there.

24:07.166 --> 24:08.500
Data.

24:08.500 --> 24:09.834
Go to

24:08.500 --> 24:09.834
Lieutenant Yar.

24:09.834 --> 24:10.959
Take her down to Sick Bay.

24:10.959 --> 24:12.625
Aye, sir.

24:12.625 --> 24:15.417
Captain to Security, I want

24:12.625 --> 24:15.417
all your senior supervisors

24:15.417 --> 24:17.917
to report to

24:15.417 --> 24:17.917
the Bridge immediately.

24:26.792 --> 24:28.959
(<i> giggling</i> )

24:28.959 --> 24:31.041
Lieutenant Yar?

24:31.041 --> 24:32.834
Here, Data.

24:37.875 --> 24:39.333
You wanted me?

24:44.041 --> 24:45.792
Captain Picard ordered me

24:45.792 --> 24:49.041
to escort you to Sick Bay,

24:45.792 --> 24:49.041
Lieutenant.

24:49.041 --> 24:53.125
Did he say when?

24:53.125 --> 24:55.959
I'm sure he meant now.

24:55.959 --> 24:59.166
So you should get

24:55.959 --> 24:59.166
into uniform.

24:59.166 --> 25:01.959
But I got out of my uniform

24:59.166 --> 25:01.959
for you, Data.

25:01.959 --> 25:07.125
Do you know how old I was

25:01.959 --> 25:07.125
when I was abandoned?

25:07.125 --> 25:09.542
Chronological age?

25:09.542 --> 25:12.583
No, I'm afraid

25:09.542 --> 25:12.583
I am not familiar with...

25:12.583 --> 25:17.375
Five. Five years old.

25:17.375 --> 25:20.458
But I survived.

25:20.458 --> 25:25.834
I learned how to stay alive,

25:20.458 --> 25:25.834
how to avoid the rape gangs.

25:25.834 --> 25:28.875
I was 15 before I escaped.

25:28.875 --> 25:31.792
I am sorry.

25:31.792 --> 25:33.333
I did not know.

25:33.333 --> 25:37.166
And what I want now

25:33.333 --> 25:37.166
is gentleness

25:37.166 --> 25:39.750
and joy

25:39.750 --> 25:42.834
and love...

25:42.834 --> 25:44.125
from you, Data.

25:44.125 --> 25:45.625
You are fully functional,

25:44.125 --> 25:45.625
aren't you?

25:45.625 --> 25:46.792
Of course, but...

25:46.792 --> 25:47.875
How fully?

25:47.875 --> 25:49.125
In every way, of course.

25:49.125 --> 25:52.959
I am programmed in

25:49.125 --> 25:52.959
multiple techniques--

25:52.959 --> 25:56.250
a broad variety

25:52.959 --> 25:56.250
of pleasuring...

25:56.250 --> 25:59.125
Oh! You jewel!

25:59.125 --> 26:01.625
That's exactly what I hoped.

26:11.583 --> 26:14.250
What have you learned,

26:11.583 --> 26:14.250
Number One?

26:14.250 --> 26:16.375
Captain, the ship's engines are

26:14.250 --> 26:16.375
cut off from the Bridge.

26:16.375 --> 26:18.083
The Assistant Chief Engineer

26:18.083 --> 26:20.875
has pulled out the isolinear

26:18.083 --> 26:20.875
optical chips from command.

26:20.875 --> 26:22.834
All the engines are off-line.

26:22.834 --> 26:26.250
Wesley has hooked up

26:22.834 --> 26:26.250
some kind of tractor beam

26:26.250 --> 26:27.458
to the ship's power.

26:27.458 --> 26:29.208
He has it aimed at the door.

26:29.208 --> 26:32.417
And we can't get past

26:29.208 --> 26:32.417
to get to the computer.

26:32.417 --> 26:34.500
Can you short out the power?

26:34.500 --> 26:38.542
Yes, I can, but it's

26:34.500 --> 26:38.542
going to take some time.

26:38.542 --> 26:40.500
Do it!

26:43.667 --> 26:45.000
Bill.

26:50.083 --> 26:53.041
Deanna, what?

26:53.041 --> 26:56.375
So many minds on this ship...

26:56.375 --> 26:58.583
all free...

26:58.583 --> 27:01.041
released.

27:01.041 --> 27:02.458
Deanna.

27:02.458 --> 27:05.792
I can feel them all...

27:05.792 --> 27:08.333
what they want...

27:08.333 --> 27:10.834
what they feel.

27:10.834 --> 27:13.875
It's a side of humans

27:10.834 --> 27:13.875
I never felt before.

27:13.875 --> 27:17.041
(<i> high-pitched whooshing</i> )

27:17.041 --> 27:18.417
Come on.

27:18.417 --> 27:21.166
I'm getting you

27:18.417 --> 27:21.166
to Sick Bay.

27:21.166 --> 27:23.291
Wouldn't you rather

27:21.166 --> 27:23.291
be alone with me?

27:23.291 --> 27:26.417
With me in your mind?

27:40.125 --> 27:43.583
The medical records we found

27:40.125 --> 27:43.583
say this works almost instantly.

27:49.208 --> 27:52.041
It's not fair, Doc.

27:52.041 --> 27:55.333
I've never seen

27:52.041 --> 27:55.333
a rainbow...

27:55.333 --> 27:57.333
a sunset...

27:57.333 --> 27:58.625
sunrise.

27:58.625 --> 28:01.291
This is going

27:58.625 --> 28:01.291
to help me?

28:01.291 --> 28:05.542
Help me see

28:01.291 --> 28:05.542
like you?

28:13.500 --> 28:14.625
Dr. Crusher.

28:20.500 --> 28:21.792
(<i> high-pitched whooshing</i> )

28:21.792 --> 28:23.166
Deanna needs your help.

28:23.166 --> 28:25.083
The formula

28:23.166 --> 28:25.083
from the old<i> Enterprise</i>

28:25.083 --> 28:26.125
didn't work.

28:26.125 --> 28:27.333
What?

28:27.333 --> 28:28.875
This water-carbon

28:27.333 --> 28:28.875
complex may induce

28:28.875 --> 28:31.000
the same symptoms but

28:28.875 --> 28:31.000
somehow it's different.

28:31.000 --> 28:32.792
Maybe it's mutated.

28:32.792 --> 28:35.041
But I've got to isolate it

28:32.792 --> 28:35.041
in order to analyze it.

28:35.041 --> 28:36.583
We don't have

28:35.041 --> 28:36.583
that kind of time.

28:36.583 --> 28:38.166
You brought Deanna in.

28:38.166 --> 28:39.750
Yes, she's infected.

28:38.166 --> 28:39.750
Then you touched her.

28:39.750 --> 28:42.291
Oh, God, and you touched me.

28:42.291 --> 28:45.000
Wait, I've got

28:42.291 --> 28:45.000
to quarantine you.

28:45.000 --> 28:48.166
If I don't get the command

28:45.000 --> 28:48.166
computer back on-line soon

28:48.166 --> 28:50.750
none of this-- whatever

28:48.166 --> 28:50.750
this is-- will matter.

28:50.750 --> 28:52.000
We'll all be dead.

29:01.333 --> 29:03.208
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental:</i>

29:03.208 --> 29:07.208
<i>It is no longer an inconvenient</i>

29:03.208 --> 29:07.208
<i>childish prank.</i>

29:07.208 --> 29:09.041

29:12.792 --> 29:15.917
<i>of my starship.</i>

29:15.917 --> 29:20.000
Wesley, this is Captain Picard.

29:15.917 --> 29:20.000
Do you see me?

29:20.000 --> 29:21.250
Yes, sir.

29:21.250 --> 29:23.542
You will now

29:21.250 --> 29:23.542
return control

29:23.542 --> 29:24.917
of this vessel

29:24.917 --> 29:27.291
to the Bridge where

29:24.917 --> 29:27.291
it belongs, at once.

29:27.291 --> 29:29.542
I'm sorry, sir.

29:27.291 --> 29:29.542
Why don't you just tell me

29:29.542 --> 29:31.458
what you want done

29:29.542 --> 29:31.458
and I'll do it.

29:31.458 --> 29:34.834
Because ship captains control

29:31.458 --> 29:34.834
their own vessels, young man!

29:34.834 --> 29:37.333
But, sir, you don't

29:34.834 --> 29:37.333
do it yourself.

29:37.333 --> 29:41.000
You give the orders,

29:37.333 --> 29:41.000
but somebody else does it.

29:41.000 --> 29:43.208
What's wrong with

29:41.000 --> 29:43.208
giving me the orders to do it?

29:43.208 --> 29:44.917
Captain, getting

29:43.208 --> 29:44.917
unusual readings now

29:44.917 --> 29:46.709
from the

29:44.917 --> 29:46.709
dwarf star.

29:46.709 --> 29:48.667
Stand by on that for a moment.

29:48.667 --> 29:52.083
Wesley!

29:52.083 --> 29:57.083
Wes, are you aware

29:52.083 --> 29:57.083
that you are behaving strangely?

29:57.083 --> 30:01.959
That a kind of infection

29:57.083 --> 30:01.959
was brought over

30:01.959 --> 30:04.000
from the<i> Tsiolkovsky</i>

30:04.000 --> 30:07.959
which acts

30:04.000 --> 30:07.959
like intoxication?

30:07.959 --> 30:10.417
Are you saying

30:07.959 --> 30:10.417
that's why I feel so hot

30:10.417 --> 30:12.208
and so strange?

30:12.208 --> 30:17.583
That's... that's a very adult

30:12.208 --> 30:17.583
bit of reasoning, Wesley.

30:17.583 --> 30:19.417
So, you mean I'm drunk!

30:19.417 --> 30:22.375
I feel strange but also good.

30:22.375 --> 30:24.041
Because...

30:24.041 --> 30:28.750
because you have lost

30:24.041 --> 30:28.750
the capacity for self-judgment.

30:28.750 --> 30:31.458
Now, alcohol does this, Wesley

30:31.458 --> 30:34.417
but the contaminant we brought

30:31.458 --> 30:34.417
back from the<i> Tsiolkovsky</i>

30:34.417 --> 30:35.875
does it even more so.

30:35.875 --> 30:39.375
What would you do

30:35.875 --> 30:39.375
if you got your ship back?

30:39.375 --> 30:43.166
Oh... it's very important

30:39.375 --> 30:43.166
I do, Wesley

30:43.166 --> 30:44.959
because I must immediately lock

30:44.959 --> 30:47.166
a tractor beam

30:44.959 --> 30:47.166
onto the<i> Tsiolkovsky--</i>

30:47.166 --> 30:48.500
and tow it out of...

30:48.500 --> 30:49.792
Tractor beams

30:48.500 --> 30:49.792
are my specialty, skipper!

30:49.792 --> 30:51.083
I'll contact you

30:49.792 --> 30:51.083
when that's done.

30:51.083 --> 30:52.375
Wesley out!

30:53.458 --> 30:56.250
Wesley! Wesley!

30:59.041 --> 31:00.917
Conn?

31:00.917 --> 31:02.250
Where are you headed?

31:02.250 --> 31:04.250
Sir! The star.

31:04.250 --> 31:06.041
It's beginning to collapse.

31:12.458 --> 31:16.291
What the hell is happening

31:12.458 --> 31:16.291
in Engineering?

31:18.000 --> 31:19.166
Lock on.

31:20.709 --> 31:23.083
Lock on,<i> Tsiolkovsky.</i>

31:23.083 --> 31:24.834
Come on, now.

31:27.750 --> 31:29.083
Where's that

31:27.750 --> 31:29.083
sonic driver?

31:29.083 --> 31:30.834
It's over there.

31:33.834 --> 31:39.542
Okay. Let's see if this

31:33.834 --> 31:39.542
cuts out his tractor beam power.

31:43.333 --> 31:45.667
Come on.

31:48.917 --> 31:50.583
No, no.

31:52.208 --> 31:54.166
I must find the answer.

31:54.166 --> 31:57.125
I've got to find the answer.

32:04.417 --> 32:06.041
Captain, tractor beam.

32:06.041 --> 32:08.834
We just locked on

32:06.041 --> 32:08.834
to the<i> Tsiolkovsky.</i>

32:08.834 --> 32:10.041
Captain to...

32:11.667 --> 32:13.083
Wesley!

32:13.083 --> 32:15.083
Wesley Crusher, come in.

32:15.083 --> 32:16.625
Ah, good. Data.

32:19.875 --> 32:21.709
At least you're functioning.

32:21.709 --> 32:23.542
Fully, Captain.

32:25.208 --> 32:29.041
Data, intoxication is

32:25.208 --> 32:29.041
a human condition.

32:29.041 --> 32:31.208
Your brain is different.

32:31.208 --> 32:33.792
It's not the same as...

32:33.792 --> 32:37.750
We are more alike than

32:33.792 --> 32:37.750
unlike, my dear Captain.

32:39.166 --> 32:42.542
I have pores.

32:39.166 --> 32:42.542
Humans have pores.

32:42.542 --> 32:47.250
I have...

32:42.542 --> 32:47.250
fingerprints.

32:47.250 --> 32:49.834
Humans have fingerprints.

32:49.834 --> 32:53.959
My chemical nutrients

32:49.834 --> 32:53.959
are like your blood.

32:53.959 --> 32:55.834
If you prick me...

32:57.208 --> 33:00.417
do I not... leak?

33:03.375 --> 33:04.750
Doctor...

33:04.750 --> 33:06.834
Captain, can I see you

33:04.750 --> 33:06.834
in your ready room?

33:06.834 --> 33:08.208
It's a private matter.

33:08.208 --> 33:09.917
No, actually,

33:08.208 --> 33:09.917
it's an urgent one.

33:09.917 --> 33:11.041
But...

33:14.083 --> 33:15.417
Damn it.

33:21.333 --> 33:22.792
Now, Doctor.

33:22.792 --> 33:24.792
I believe I've become infected

33:22.792 --> 33:24.792
myself, Captain.

33:24.792 --> 33:27.792
Do you know what

33:24.792 --> 33:27.792
the infection is?

33:27.792 --> 33:29.083
(<i> giggles</i> )

33:29.083 --> 33:30.333
Come on. Quickly!

33:30.333 --> 33:31.750
Sorry.

33:31.750 --> 33:34.625
It is definitely like

33:31.750 --> 33:34.625
alcohol intoxication--

33:34.625 --> 33:37.041
the same lack of good judgment.

33:37.041 --> 33:42.375
For example, right now,

33:37.041 --> 33:42.375
I find you extremely...

33:42.375 --> 33:44.959
extremely...

33:44.959 --> 33:48.125
Of course, we haven't time

33:44.959 --> 33:48.125
for that sort of thing.

33:48.125 --> 33:49.917
What sort of thing?

33:49.917 --> 33:53.250
Oh, God, would I love

33:49.917 --> 33:53.250
to show you.

33:53.250 --> 33:56.291
Doctor, there

33:53.250 --> 33:56.291
must be a cure.

33:56.291 --> 33:58.000
Some formula...

33:58.000 --> 33:59.291
(<i> clears throat</i> )

33:59.291 --> 34:01.291
...similar to

33:59.291 --> 34:01.291
the old one.

34:01.291 --> 34:03.250
Damn it, damn it,

34:01.291 --> 34:03.250
Captain.

34:04.583 --> 34:07.875
My dear Captain.

34:09.917 --> 34:12.291
You owe me something.

34:12.291 --> 34:14.917
You do realize

34:12.291 --> 34:14.917
that, don't you?

34:14.917 --> 34:16.500
I'm a woman.

34:16.500 --> 34:20.875
I haven't had the comfort

34:16.500 --> 34:20.875
of a husband, a man...

34:24.917 --> 34:26.917
Not now, Doctor.

34:26.917 --> 34:28.166
Please.

34:40.333 --> 34:42.750
Bridge to Riker, urgent.

34:42.750 --> 34:44.750
Riker here.

34:44.750 --> 34:46.375
Sir, regret to inform you

34:46.375 --> 34:48.709
that the Captain

34:46.375 --> 34:48.709
appears to be infected.

34:48.709 --> 34:50.000
And Data.

34:50.000 --> 34:51.709
Thank you, Lieutenant.

34:51.709 --> 34:52.875
I'm on my way.

34:52.875 --> 34:54.667
You'll have

34:52.875 --> 34:54.667
to handle this.

34:54.667 --> 34:56.792
Are you saying

34:54.667 --> 34:56.792
you're going to handle that?

35:04.417 --> 35:06.208
(<i> alarm blaring</i> )

35:09.208 --> 35:11.250
WORF:

35:09.208 --> 35:11.250
What we're

35:09.208 --> 35:11.250
seeing, sir

35:11.250 --> 35:14.709
is a huge chunk of the star's

35:11.250 --> 35:14.709
surface blown away--

35:14.709 --> 35:16.000
heading for us.

35:17.709 --> 35:19.125
Take us...

35:20.333 --> 35:21.917
Are you all right, sir?

35:21.917 --> 35:23.417
Worf...

35:23.417 --> 35:25.583
you do know

35:23.417 --> 35:25.583
what to do.

35:25.583 --> 35:27.709
Take us...

35:27.709 --> 35:29.208
Take us out of here.

35:29.208 --> 35:30.542
Right.

35:42.166 --> 35:43.792
The controls

35:42.166 --> 35:43.792
are still off-line, sir.

35:43.792 --> 35:45.208
Override.

35:49.208 --> 35:50.709
Same result, sir.

35:57.166 --> 36:00.917
RIKER:

35:57.166 --> 36:00.917
Wes, come in, please.

36:00.917 --> 36:03.750
Wesley Crusher, this is Riker.

36:03.750 --> 36:06.917
This is urgent. Come in, please.

36:15.917 --> 36:17.500
Engineering, urgent.

36:17.500 --> 36:20.500
We must have ship's power.

36:20.500 --> 36:23.834
These are control chips.

36:29.417 --> 36:31.291
Bridge from Engineering.

36:31.291 --> 36:33.166
The star is

36:31.291 --> 36:33.166
still collapsing.

36:33.166 --> 36:34.875
We're directly in the path.

36:34.875 --> 36:36.458
I can't help you, Bridge.

36:36.458 --> 36:38.625
Someone here has yanked out

36:36.458 --> 36:38.625
all the control chips.

36:38.625 --> 36:40.542
It was an adult who did it.

36:40.542 --> 36:43.709
Sir, I estimate 14 minutes

36:40.542 --> 36:43.709
until that mass gets here.

36:43.709 --> 36:46.208
No way, sir. I cannot replace

36:43.709 --> 36:46.208
these chips in 14 minutes.

36:46.208 --> 36:47.417
Two hours...

36:47.417 --> 36:49.166
three, maybe.

36:49.166 --> 36:51.417
Data could assemble

36:49.166 --> 36:51.417
them back faster.

36:52.792 --> 36:54.083
PICARD:

36:52.792 --> 36:54.083
What?

36:54.083 --> 36:55.375
What's that?

36:55.375 --> 36:56.959
What's that, Wesley?

36:56.959 --> 36:58.709
Well, they're just simple

36:56.959 --> 36:58.709
isolinear chips, sir.

36:58.709 --> 36:59.917
To Data, anyway.

36:59.917 --> 37:02.291
He could shuffle them

36:59.917 --> 37:02.291
like cards.

37:02.291 --> 37:04.000
Come on, Data. Hurry!

37:11.041 --> 37:13.000
<i>Ship's Log,</i>

Nice to see

37:25.500 --> 37:26.875
you, Wesley.

37:26.875 --> 37:28.709
Hi, Mr. Data.

37:28.709 --> 37:30.041
No time for courtesy.

37:30.041 --> 37:31.875
Get the damned

37:30.041 --> 37:31.875
control chips back in place

37:31.875 --> 37:34.083
in the correct order. Now!

37:34.083 --> 37:37.417
It's like a game of

37:34.083 --> 37:37.417
"How fast can you do it?"

37:37.417 --> 37:39.375
Ah, a game.

37:39.375 --> 37:42.417
(<i> alarm sounding</i> )

37:49.166 --> 37:52.041
I think I can switch this

37:49.166 --> 37:52.041
to main viewer, sir.

38:05.333 --> 38:08.208
Data, we have eight or

38:05.333 --> 38:08.208
nine minutes at most.

38:08.208 --> 38:09.875
Can you finish by then?

38:09.875 --> 38:14.917
No. This will take slightly

38:09.875 --> 38:14.917
more time than we have, sir.

38:24.333 --> 38:29.583
Oh, damn it, no! I can't

38:24.333 --> 38:29.583
afford to get this.

38:38.125 --> 38:40.125
Beverly.

38:40.125 --> 38:42.542
Yes, Jean-Luc?

38:42.542 --> 38:46.583
You will address

38:42.542 --> 38:46.583
me as Captain.

38:46.583 --> 38:49.000
(<i> laughs</i> ):

38:46.583 --> 38:49.000
Captain?

38:49.000 --> 38:52.709
Well, then, my dear Captain

38:52.709 --> 38:57.875
you will address me as

38:52.709 --> 38:57.875
Chief Medical Officer or Doctor.

38:57.875 --> 38:59.583
I will?

38:59.583 --> 39:00.792
That's true.

39:00.792 --> 39:03.959
I started out by

39:00.792 --> 39:03.959
calling you Beverly

39:03.959 --> 39:06.959
and, of course,

39:03.959 --> 39:06.959
naturally, you...

39:06.959 --> 39:10.375
I'm still not

39:06.959 --> 39:10.375
thinking straight.

39:10.375 --> 39:15.125
Likewise. Where the hell

39:10.375 --> 39:15.125
was I headed?

39:15.125 --> 39:18.792
If that's something you

39:15.125 --> 39:18.792
were going to test...

39:18.792 --> 39:20.583
Yes, on Geordi!

39:20.583 --> 39:21.959
Come here.

39:24.291 --> 39:26.875
(<i> alarm sounding</i> )

39:33.458 --> 39:37.834
See how I reversed the fields

39:33.458 --> 39:37.834
on this, Commander?

39:37.834 --> 39:41.834
I made it into

39:37.834 --> 39:41.834
a repulser beam.

39:41.834 --> 39:44.834
If we just had

39:41.834 --> 39:44.834
one minute more, sir.

39:57.417 --> 40:01.542
If this were a hundred times

39:57.417 --> 40:01.542
more powerful than it is...

40:04.750 --> 40:08.125
Why not try it

40:04.750 --> 40:08.125
with the real thing?

40:10.041 --> 40:11.709
Why not reverse fields on this,

40:10.041 --> 40:11.709
Ma'am?

40:11.709 --> 40:13.208
If we just need an extra minute.

40:13.208 --> 40:16.208
It would take weeks

40:13.208 --> 40:16.208
of laying out new circuits.

40:16.208 --> 40:18.125
Why not just see it

40:16.208 --> 40:18.125
in your head?

40:19.333 --> 40:22.291
Come off the main lead

40:22.291 --> 40:25.709
split off at the force activator

40:25.709 --> 40:28.875
then... then...

40:28.875 --> 40:33.291
if I could just

40:28.875 --> 40:33.291
think straight about this.

40:33.291 --> 40:36.000
I made this a broader-based

40:33.291 --> 40:36.000
remedy--

40:36.000 --> 40:38.041
I hope.

40:38.041 --> 40:40.959
But it's still very close

40:38.041 --> 40:40.959
to the formula

40:40.959 --> 40:42.625
from the old<i> Enterprise</i>

40:40.959 --> 40:42.625

40:45.625 --> 40:48.667
But almost exactly the

40:45.625 --> 40:48.667
same conditions as here.

40:48.667 --> 40:51.917
Wow! What was

40:48.667 --> 40:51.917
in that, Doctor?

40:51.917 --> 40:54.709
My head's beginning

40:51.917 --> 40:54.709
to clear.

40:54.709 --> 40:56.125
Come here.

41:00.458 --> 41:03.583
Here, take this

41:00.458 --> 41:03.583

We're not going

41:22.709 --> 41:24.834
to make it, Captain.

If we only had

41:24.834 --> 41:27.375
a minute or so more.

Yes, then reversing power leads

WESLEY:

41:48.250 --> 41:51.583
Don't you see?

41:51.583 --> 41:56.000
It's giving us a push-off,

41:51.583 --> 41:56.000
the extra time we need.

41:56.000 --> 41:58.834
We're pushing away.

42:20.291 --> 42:21.709
Bridge, engage engines.

42:33.083 --> 42:35.333
Captain, something seemed

42:33.083 --> 42:35.333
to move us aside

42:35.333 --> 42:36.834
at the last minute.

42:36.834 --> 42:39.792
Do we owe our thanks

42:36.834 --> 42:39.792
to Commander Data, sir?

42:39.792 --> 42:43.875
PICARD:

42:39.792 --> 42:43.875
Yes, and Wesley may have given

42:39.792 --> 42:43.875
us a few seconds, too.

42:43.875 --> 42:46.792
Did he say Wesley--

42:43.875 --> 42:46.792
the boy?

42:46.792 --> 42:48.875
He said Wesley.

42:54.083 --> 42:59.083
It's only fair to mention

42:54.083 --> 42:59.083
Wesley in a log entry, sir.

42:59.083 --> 43:01.792
Fair is fair.

43:01.792 --> 43:06.166
And let's credit

43:01.792 --> 43:06.166
his science teacher, too.

43:25.959 --> 43:27.917
Congratulations, sir.

43:27.917 --> 43:29.834
To many people.

43:44.667 --> 43:46.500
Data.

43:46.500 --> 43:49.125
I'm only going to tell

43:46.500 --> 43:49.125
you this just once--

43:49.125 --> 43:51.250
it never happened.

43:56.750 --> 43:58.834
I put it to you all--

43:58.834 --> 44:02.417
I think we shall end up

43:58.834 --> 44:02.417
with a fine crew

44:02.417 --> 44:05.083
if we avoid temptation.

44:10.000 --> 44:12.208
So, Number One

44:12.208 --> 44:14.041
let's go to

44:12.208 --> 44:14.041
our next job.

44:14.041 --> 44:15.166
Aye, sir.

44:15.166 --> 44:18.000
Helm, prepare

44:15.166 --> 44:18.000
for warp 3.

44:18.000 --> 44:21.166
Heading 294, mark 37.

44:21.166 --> 44:25.583
Warp 3, heading 294,

44:21.166 --> 44:25.583
mark 37, sir.

44:25.583 --> 44:27.333
Engage.
