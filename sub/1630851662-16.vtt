WEBVTT

00:27.026 --> 00:30.488
Forager is very happy
to welcome Baby to our Hive.

00:30.572 --> 00:34.701
Forager will also miss Bio-Ship
very, very much.

00:36.578 --> 00:39.456
But Forager is happy that
Bio-Ship will graduate

00:39.456 --> 00:42.584
to a new life stage of rest
and retirement on Mars.

00:42.584 --> 00:45.462
Forager knows
Bio-Ship wished for such.

00:46.713 --> 00:48.590
How is Megan Morse doing?

00:48.590 --> 00:52.635
Uh, there are good days
and bad days.

00:52.719 --> 00:55.013
More bad than good,
to be honest,

00:55.889 --> 00:57.849
but I'm keeping busy.

00:57.849 --> 01:00.101
I helped Em'ree
move in upstairs,

01:00.185 --> 01:03.062
and get a job at
the Erdel Initiative.

01:03.146 --> 01:07.233
I'm also closing up
Conner's affairs,

01:07.317 --> 01:09.986
and that's very painful,

01:09.986 --> 01:15.116
but my teammates
and the Kents and my friends,

01:15.200 --> 01:17.285
everyone has been so wonderful,

01:17.285 --> 01:19.662
stopping by, offering support,

01:19.746 --> 01:22.332
and so, so many casseroles.

01:22.332 --> 01:25.460
Megan Morse's Hive can help
Megan Morse get traught.

01:27.086 --> 01:30.840
Has Megan Morse seen
Garfield Logan?

01:30.924 --> 01:32.759
We've talked on the phone,

01:32.759 --> 01:34.761
and he was
the first person that called
when I got back from M'arzz.

01:34.761 --> 01:38.014
But Megan Morse has not
met with Garfield Logan?

01:38.014 --> 01:41.017
Not yet. I imagine
has been busy with Space Trek

01:41.017 --> 01:42.769
and The Outsiders and Perdita.

01:42.769 --> 01:46.439
Garfield Logan has left
Space Trek 3016.

01:46.523 --> 01:50.568
Garfield Logan no longer goes
on missions with the Outsiders,

01:50.652 --> 01:54.656
and Garfield Logan has
broken up with Perdita Vladek.

01:54.656 --> 01:58.701
Forager thinks
Megan Morse should go see
Garfield Logan.

02:36.990 --> 02:38.908
Must we do this?

02:40.326 --> 02:41.452
It is humiliating.

02:41.536 --> 02:43.246
We apologize,
Lord Arion,

02:43.246 --> 02:45.915
but it has been almost a month
since you revealed yourself,

02:45.999 --> 02:48.209
and all of Atlantis
has been chanting your name.

02:48.293 --> 02:51.588
Certainly you can see
the need for us to confirm
your identity.

02:51.588 --> 02:52.922
If it is easier,

02:53.006 --> 02:55.925
I can simply tell people
I lied about being Arion.

02:56.009 --> 02:57.969
We are not trying to
make things easy.

02:57.969 --> 02:59.596
We merely seek the truth.

02:59.596 --> 03:02.599
Please, just perform
a little magic for us.

03:02.599 --> 03:04.684
Anything will do.

03:05.768 --> 03:07.562
Behold Arion.

03:07.562 --> 03:10.607
the great Lord
and failure of Atlantis.

03:24.537 --> 03:25.538
Well?

03:28.041 --> 03:30.960
Uh, the test is not conclusive,

03:31.044 --> 03:35.089
but your magical residue is
indeed, uh, unique.

03:35.173 --> 03:37.634
Your magicks are of
an older strain

03:37.634 --> 03:40.053
than any
we have encountered before.

03:40.053 --> 03:41.471
Our readings concur,

03:41.471 --> 03:44.265
and your DNA is a match with
Batman's samples

03:44.349 --> 03:46.100
for both Vandal
and Cassandra Savage.

03:46.184 --> 03:48.770
Then, it would seem we have
as much confirmation

03:48.770 --> 03:50.688
of your immortality
as possible.

03:50.772 --> 03:54.317
Short of a direct comparison
to Arion's DNA
from ancient Atlantis.

03:54.317 --> 03:59.280
I'm afraid we did not think
to collect DNA samples
12000 years ago.

03:59.364 --> 04:02.659
Unless we finally found
your legendary crown

04:02.659 --> 04:06.788
with surviving hair follicles attached.

04:06.788 --> 04:09.165
Our prophecies speak of
your crown.

04:09.165 --> 04:10.458
Do you know where it is?

04:10.458 --> 04:12.919
My crown, like my kingdom,
was lost

04:12.919 --> 04:14.504
the day Atlantis was sunk,

04:14.504 --> 04:16.297
buried by the sands of time,

04:16.381 --> 04:19.509
and entombed by
the gravestone
you call Xebel.

04:19.509 --> 04:22.303
For centuries,
archaeologists have searched
for the crown

04:22.387 --> 04:24.180
in the ancient ruins
beneath Xebel.

04:24.180 --> 04:27.183
Those excavations
barely go down a millennium.

04:27.183 --> 04:30.979
The Earth consumed Atlantis
12 times that many years ago.

04:32.188 --> 04:34.524
Whatever remains
of those ruins,

04:34.524 --> 04:38.194
my ruins,
are likely beyond your grasp.

04:54.460 --> 04:57.046
Don't shift your legs.
Keep your head straight
and back straight,

04:57.130 --> 04:59.048
eyes focused on
your landing point.

04:59.132 --> 05:00.967
Oh, you've got it.
You've got it.

05:07.140 --> 05:09.475
It's harder than it looks.

05:09.559 --> 05:11.853
<i>Stand up, get up
Let's get traught</i>

05:11.853 --> 05:14.188
<i>Try, try again
with all you've got!</i>

05:14.272 --> 05:18.192
Okay, okay,
this is getting old.

05:18.276 --> 05:20.278
We're not getting anywhere.

05:20.278 --> 05:23.781
I know you can
find your way back to me.

05:23.865 --> 05:26.242
I believe in you, Conner.

05:26.242 --> 05:30.079
We'll get through this... together.

05:30.163 --> 05:31.414
I love you.

05:33.583 --> 05:35.626
Love you, too, M'gann.

05:35.710 --> 05:37.503
Don't know what I'd do
without you.

05:41.049 --> 05:47.930
Arion! Arion!

05:52.060 --> 05:54.896
Lord Arion,
forgive me if I overstep,

05:54.896 --> 06:00.151
but you have been hiding
in sanctuary here
for weeks now.

06:00.151 --> 06:03.946
There are Atlanteans below
from all eight City-States.

06:04.030 --> 06:07.658
Could you not say something
to give these people hope?

06:07.742 --> 06:09.577
I never wanted this, Chian.

06:09.577 --> 06:14.040
With respect, my Lord,
what else could you expect?

06:14.040 --> 06:17.418
You single-handedly saved
Poseidonis twice.

06:17.502 --> 06:19.462
I owed Atlantis that much.

06:19.462 --> 06:23.591
If I could
sneak away unnoticed,

06:23.591 --> 06:25.134
without causing a riot...

06:26.761 --> 06:27.637
I would.

06:27.637 --> 06:31.224
Arion! Arion!

06:31.224 --> 06:33.851
They're rioting
in Xebel, in Arion's name.

06:33.935 --> 06:36.813
King Nereus must be stewing
in his own juices.

06:36.813 --> 06:38.564
I believe that is called irony.

06:38.648 --> 06:41.150
Father has been
actively alienating
his citizens

06:41.234 --> 06:44.028
from Poseidonis and you
for years.

06:44.112 --> 06:47.532
Suddenly he's surprised
Xebelians want a new order?

06:47.532 --> 06:50.785
His attempts to sway the masses
now fall on ears

06:50.785 --> 06:52.286
that only hear the Prophecy.

06:52.370 --> 06:54.705
A prophecy that
merely muddies the waters.

06:54.789 --> 06:57.333
"The stranger come
from out our past.

06:57.333 --> 07:00.920
The Trident's threat,
the Red Death, the True King."

07:00.920 --> 07:03.172
Orin, even I must admit,

07:03.256 --> 07:04.507
these elements of the prophecy

07:04.507 --> 07:06.717
resonate with
Arion's recent deeds,

07:06.801 --> 07:09.345
and understandably,
with all of Atlantis.

07:11.139 --> 07:13.015
As you can see,
Kaldur'ahm,

07:13.099 --> 07:16.269
this is a delicate
and complex situation.

07:16.269 --> 07:19.272
Take a covert squad to Xebel
to search for Arion's crown.

07:19.272 --> 07:22.358
The Watchtower performed
a deep geo-scan of the area.

07:22.358 --> 07:25.444
It discovered a vast
subterranean pocket ocean

07:25.528 --> 07:26.654
beneath Xebel's sea floor.

07:26.654 --> 07:28.030
By the Gods.

07:28.114 --> 07:30.658
This may contain
the ruins of ancient Atlantis,

07:30.658 --> 07:32.618
of which Arion has spoken.

07:32.702 --> 07:36.497
Find a way into this undersea
without drawing attention.

07:36.581 --> 07:38.249
Maintain radio silence.

07:38.249 --> 07:41.043
News of this search
would only heighten unrest.

07:41.127 --> 07:42.670
For the sake of all Atlantis,

07:42.670 --> 07:46.090
we must prove or disprove
this Prophecy.

07:46.174 --> 07:47.425
Of course, Annax.

07:50.928 --> 07:53.931
I can't believe
you called Perdita.
You had no right.

07:54.015 --> 07:56.184
You're missing the point, Gar.

07:56.184 --> 07:58.769
Perdita and I are
both worried about you.

07:58.853 --> 08:02.190
Self-medicating may help
block your pain
in the short term,

08:02.190 --> 08:03.900
but, in the long term,

08:03.900 --> 08:06.527
it only blocks
your healing process.

08:06.611 --> 08:08.654
I don't need
your healing process.

08:08.738 --> 08:09.697
Just some sleep.

08:09.697 --> 08:10.907
Gar, please.

08:10.907 --> 08:12.200
We learned on M'arzz

08:12.200 --> 08:14.535
you had
underlying emotional trauma

08:14.619 --> 08:16.120
you needed to deal with.

08:16.204 --> 08:19.207
Hallucinating about Brion
didn't come from nowhere.

08:19.207 --> 08:22.418
You were terrified of losing
another family member.

08:22.418 --> 08:25.379
- And that was before...
- Before Conner died?

08:26.380 --> 08:27.715
You can't even say it.

08:27.715 --> 08:29.759
Maybe I'm not the one
who needs help.

08:29.759 --> 08:31.552
Maybe I do need help,

08:31.636 --> 08:33.471
but we're talking
about you now.

08:33.471 --> 08:36.432
and you promised to
seek counseling
when you got back to Earth.

08:36.432 --> 08:39.685
Because I was diagnosed by
someone posing as you
in my mind?

08:39.769 --> 08:40.978
Like I'm going to trust that.

08:41.062 --> 08:42.647
We still have no clue
who it was.

08:42.647 --> 08:44.273
For all we know,
it was Conner's killer.

08:44.357 --> 08:48.110
Fine, but now I'm saying
you're suffering
from depression,

08:48.194 --> 08:49.946
maybe post-traumatic
stress disorder.

08:49.946 --> 08:51.697
You have
all the classic symptoms.

08:51.781 --> 08:52.990
Let me guess.

08:53.074 --> 08:55.534
Sleeplessness, self-medication,

08:55.618 --> 08:57.578
withdrawal from
normal activities,

08:57.662 --> 08:58.996
pushing love ones away?

08:59.080 --> 09:01.123
- Yes, you're doing all of that.
- No kidding.

09:01.207 --> 09:02.708
I've been here before, right?

09:02.792 --> 09:05.836
When Mom died, when Rita died,
Chief, Negative Woman,

09:05.920 --> 09:07.630
Tula, Jason, Ted, Wally.

09:07.630 --> 09:09.173
I survived it all.

09:09.257 --> 09:10.633
I know the pitfalls,

09:10.633 --> 09:13.970
and I know how to
get through this in my own way.

09:15.680 --> 09:19.183
It's clearly different
this time.

09:19.267 --> 09:21.477
Don't forget, I was there, Gar,

09:21.477 --> 09:23.145
through all of it.

09:23.229 --> 09:25.940
I've seen how strong you are,

09:25.940 --> 09:30.111
but everyone has
a breaking point,

09:30.111 --> 09:32.822
and you're well past yours.

09:34.156 --> 09:35.992
You need help.

09:35.992 --> 09:39.120
No one knows what I need
better than I do,

09:39.120 --> 09:41.664
so just leave me alone.

09:49.213 --> 09:52.675
Does Kaldur'ahm
not understand how close
our baby's arrival is?

09:52.675 --> 09:55.177
What if the big day comes early
and you're not here?

09:55.261 --> 09:57.722
I'm sure
he would rather reconsider

09:57.722 --> 09:59.849
than have to explain
your absence

09:59.849 --> 10:02.351
to our soon-to-be-born child.

10:02.435 --> 10:05.187
Coral, Rodunn, my loves,

10:05.271 --> 10:07.148
It is an honor, not a burden

10:07.148 --> 10:09.525
that Kaldur chose me
for this mission.

10:13.195 --> 10:15.948
I will be back
in a few short days.

10:16.032 --> 10:19.618
Be patient,
little one.

10:19.702 --> 10:20.953
Easy for you to say.

10:21.037 --> 10:24.332
I will see you all again soon,
because?

10:24.332 --> 10:27.001
We never say goodbye.

10:28.961 --> 10:31.881
You said
you would take a break
after Orm was captured.

10:31.881 --> 10:33.716
Well he was captured weeks ago,

10:33.716 --> 10:35.259
and you have not slowed down.

10:35.343 --> 10:37.553
Let someone else take
this mission.

10:37.553 --> 10:40.431
I cannot. The King has
entrusted it to me.

10:40.431 --> 10:42.141
In any case, I am fine.

10:42.141 --> 10:45.603
As you are coming with
La'gaan and I,
you will see that.

10:45.603 --> 10:47.897
On your secret mission
for the King?

10:50.399 --> 10:52.818
- Yes.
- May I come?

10:52.902 --> 10:54.111
I am sorry, Delphis.

10:54.195 --> 10:55.863
You have
your volunteer work here,

10:55.863 --> 10:57.990
and you are not trained
for such things.

10:59.450 --> 11:01.410
If you need anything,
call my parents.

11:01.494 --> 11:03.662
What if you need something,
Kaldur'ahm?

11:03.746 --> 11:05.790
Thank you! Exactly.

11:15.049 --> 11:16.759
It's a long way to jump.

11:16.759 --> 11:18.677
Come on! Jumping is
totally your thing.

11:18.761 --> 11:20.513
You can do this
with your eyes closed.

11:20.513 --> 11:22.473
But, like, don't close
your eyes for real,

11:22.473 --> 11:25.601
'cause you might miss
and fall forever
through a terrifying abyss.

11:25.601 --> 11:29.772
I might miss anyway.
It's a long way to jump.

11:29.772 --> 11:32.900
Dude, we'll make it.
We'll make it together.

11:32.900 --> 11:34.318
But what's the point?

11:35.653 --> 11:39.240
- Look at us.
- Okay, sure. We're dead.

11:39.240 --> 11:42.618
Ghosts, phantoms, spirits, whatever.

11:42.618 --> 11:45.955
But I don't think
we're in Heaven or in Hell.

11:45.955 --> 11:47.456
We're in
some kind of Purgatory,

11:47.540 --> 11:49.375
so, we have to keep moving.

11:49.375 --> 11:51.836
Climb the mountain,
leap the chasm,
pass the test

11:51.836 --> 11:53.421
and prove ourselves worthy.

11:53.421 --> 11:56.090
Only way to reach
our final destination.

11:56.090 --> 11:59.468
It's a long way
to jump.

11:59.552 --> 12:04.890
Always is.
When it matters,
it always will be.

12:04.974 --> 12:06.142
But we can do it.

12:06.142 --> 12:08.018
We just need a running start.

12:19.155 --> 12:20.531
Back again?

12:20.531 --> 12:22.158
How many times can I tell you

12:22.158 --> 12:25.161
I do not know
this so-called Arion?

12:25.161 --> 12:27.496
I'm not here to
talk about Arion.

12:27.580 --> 12:30.124
I'm here to talk about
the past.

12:30.124 --> 12:32.835
Our past.
How far back does it go?

12:32.835 --> 12:35.212
What are you
babbling about now?

12:35.296 --> 12:36.672
Did Vandal Savage turn you,

12:36.672 --> 12:38.841
or did you hate me
from the moment we met?

12:38.841 --> 12:40.509
When I first came to Atlantis

12:40.593 --> 12:42.928
and our mother tried to
make us a family,

12:43.012 --> 12:45.181
were you already plotting
against me?

12:45.181 --> 12:49.518
Oh, please, Orin. You had me
in this cell for six years.

12:49.602 --> 12:52.855
You came to visit me
16 times.

12:52.855 --> 12:55.191
Haven't we covered all this?

13:01.447 --> 13:03.365
Find DNA on this
and run tests.

13:03.449 --> 13:05.993
You want me to run tests
on your brother?

13:05.993 --> 13:09.538
I want to run tests
to see if he is my brother.

13:09.622 --> 13:10.456
Now I must go.

13:10.456 --> 13:12.333
Go? You cannot go now.

13:12.333 --> 13:15.836
- The kingdom...
- I leave our kingdom in your capable hands.

13:26.639 --> 13:28.891
Ugh, ma'al.

13:28.891 --> 13:31.143
I was just coming up
to get you.

13:31.227 --> 13:34.563
For the intervention.

13:35.648 --> 13:38.150
All right.
Let's get this over with.

13:38.234 --> 13:39.401
Who's first?

13:39.485 --> 13:42.738
Ah, <i>hermano,</i>
don't be like that.

13:42.738 --> 13:44.240
Can't we just be cool here?

13:44.240 --> 13:46.200
The way we made the Outsiders
cool with the world.

13:46.200 --> 13:48.661
The world was not cool
with us metas
before the Outsiders.

13:48.661 --> 13:50.538
- You pulled the Outsiders together.
- Yes!

13:50.538 --> 13:51.872
Togetherness.

13:51.956 --> 13:53.415
<i>Symbiose,</i> right?
Key point here.

13:53.499 --> 13:55.668
Like, look at Windfall,
and even Livewire...

13:55.668 --> 13:59.171
They're with the Outsiders now
'cause you inspired them.

13:59.255 --> 14:00.589
Inspired, yes!

14:00.673 --> 14:02.758
You inspired meta kids
all over the world.

14:02.758 --> 14:04.218
- With your big mouth.
- Big mouth?

14:04.218 --> 14:06.929
- His, uh, voice. Your voice!
- Your voice!

14:06.929 --> 14:09.056
The one-of-a-kind
Garfield Logan!

14:09.056 --> 14:10.224
We miss you, man.

14:10.224 --> 14:11.433
We just want you
to get some help.

14:11.517 --> 14:13.310
And like,
how bad would that be?

14:13.394 --> 14:14.895
We all need
a little help sometimes.

14:14.979 --> 14:18.399
That way we can all get back
to inspiring folks.

14:18.399 --> 14:19.733
<i>Symbiose.</i>

14:20.901 --> 14:21.986
Nice routine.

14:21.986 --> 14:23.862
You have
the timing down perfect.

14:23.946 --> 14:26.282
Now take it on the road. Next.

14:26.282 --> 14:28.200
You can't talk to my guys
that way.

14:28.284 --> 14:30.536
Especially because they're
our guys.

14:30.536 --> 14:33.831
I know
you know better,
because you taught me better,

14:33.831 --> 14:36.083
and I know
you still have more to teach.

14:38.085 --> 14:41.005
Gar, when you went to Mars,

14:41.005 --> 14:44.300
I thought I was
just filling in as leader.

14:44.300 --> 14:47.636
So, okay, if you don't want to
lead again, that's fine,

14:47.720 --> 14:51.307
but I still need my friend
and mentor back.

14:51.307 --> 14:54.143
And that can't happen
until you help yourself.

14:55.060 --> 14:56.353
So?

14:56.437 --> 15:00.649
So, the leader thing,
figure it out yourself.

15:00.733 --> 15:02.735
I did. Next.

15:06.071 --> 15:09.575
Like you, I have long opposed
Orin's rule,

15:09.575 --> 15:12.661
but transferring your loyalty
to this false legend...

15:12.745 --> 15:14.455
- False legend?
- Blasphemy!

15:14.455 --> 15:15.831
Arion is
the true king of Atlantis!

15:15.831 --> 15:18.250
- Surrender your throne.
- To Arion!

15:18.334 --> 15:22.171
Keep them back. Teach them duty.

15:22.171 --> 15:24.089
The King's Watch
would silence us!

15:24.173 --> 15:27.051
Nereus would
silence us.

15:27.051 --> 15:30.638
<i>We will use
the unrest in Xebel
to cover our infiltration.</i>

15:30.638 --> 15:32.765
<i>Then, per
the Watchtower's intel,</i>

15:32.765 --> 15:35.559
<i>we will make our way to
the Grave of Legends.</i>

15:35.643 --> 15:37.645
<i>It is a holy site. Guarded.</i>

15:37.645 --> 15:40.773
<i>But Nereus' Watch will be
stretched thin
dealing with the crowds.</i>

15:40.773 --> 15:43.192
<i>We should be able to
work undetected.</i>

15:43.192 --> 15:45.361
Neptune's Beard!

15:45.361 --> 15:47.154
Wyynde, he looks like you.

15:47.154 --> 15:50.783
Well, some of us are
the direct descendants of
the old heroes.

15:50.783 --> 15:54.620
The ground between
Xebel and the undersea beneath
is thinnest here.

15:54.620 --> 15:56.163
This is where we dig.

16:01.794 --> 16:03.879
Should not one of us
stand watch for guards?

16:03.879 --> 16:05.673
Better to
complete the job quickly.

16:12.763 --> 16:14.431
Arion!

16:15.891 --> 16:17.518
You had no wish to
cause a riot,

16:17.518 --> 16:19.353
but rioting has begun.

16:19.353 --> 16:21.397
Xebel is in chaos.

16:21.397 --> 16:23.190
Only you can restore peace.

16:23.190 --> 16:26.985
No. These are matters for
Atlantis' current leaders.

16:27.069 --> 16:28.862
Nobody will listen to them.

16:28.946 --> 16:30.823
The riots are in your name.

16:30.823 --> 16:35.369
Then, I will
discuss Xebel with
the High King.

16:35.369 --> 16:37.746
Annax Orin has left the palace.

16:37.830 --> 16:40.999
Lord Arion, our absent king
left orders

16:41.083 --> 16:42.751
for you to remain here,

16:42.835 --> 16:44.628
but I can sneak you out.

16:52.010 --> 16:54.888
Will you look at this?

16:54.972 --> 16:57.933
A poor little goldfish
has lost his way.

16:57.933 --> 17:01.603
Your chum Kaldur'ahm
was here a month ago

17:01.687 --> 17:04.022
and failed to find
your brother.

17:04.106 --> 17:06.734
Nothing for you to
find here either,

17:06.734 --> 17:08.152
except trouble.

17:08.152 --> 17:10.612
I have some experience
with trouble.

17:10.696 --> 17:13.198
Oh, not Ninth Tride trouble.

17:13.282 --> 17:16.577
Your authority
means nothing here.

17:16.577 --> 17:20.080
My loyal subjects may disagree.

17:23.208 --> 17:27.546
Really, M'chiste,
you have nothing to fear
from Lemon Sharks,

17:27.546 --> 17:29.214
save their teeth.

17:33.260 --> 17:37.431
Danuuth... We need to talk.

17:38.640 --> 17:40.601
Sorry,
did I just hear you say

17:40.601 --> 17:42.603
you figured everything out
on your own?

17:42.603 --> 17:44.021
'Cause no frickin' way.

17:44.021 --> 17:47.024
Gar, you never had to
figure nothing out alone.

17:47.024 --> 17:49.443
I was there
after you lost your mom.

17:49.443 --> 17:51.111
It was bad. Real bad.

17:51.195 --> 17:55.115
But you got help. From me,
from Rita, from Megan.

17:55.199 --> 17:58.243
And 'cause of that,
you never lost your optimism,

17:58.327 --> 18:01.330
your desire to do right,
to help people.

18:01.330 --> 18:02.873
Like how you helped me.

18:02.873 --> 18:06.126
I was nothing but a brain
stuck in a frickin' metal jar.

18:06.210 --> 18:08.295
But you showed me

18:08.295 --> 18:11.840
the only jar holding me back
was the one I put myself in.

18:11.924 --> 18:13.842
You set me free.

18:13.926 --> 18:17.346
And then our little Doom Patrol
had to go and make
the ultimate sacrifice,

18:17.346 --> 18:19.890
'cause that's what
us heroes do, right?

18:19.890 --> 18:23.477
Rita, Chief, Val... gone.
Game over.

18:23.477 --> 18:25.354
Then they found
my friggin' head

18:25.354 --> 18:27.231
at the bottom of that river
and woke me up.

18:27.231 --> 18:30.359
My only thought was that
I should've died too.

18:30.359 --> 18:32.861
And again, you were there.

18:32.945 --> 18:35.322
Convinced me that
my survivin' was a gift.

18:35.322 --> 18:37.908
The last gift I could give them
that's gone.

18:37.908 --> 18:41.286
That Garfield Logan
would never have abandoned
his friends,

18:41.370 --> 18:44.373
his family, or the world,
like you're doing now.

18:44.373 --> 18:46.125
So if you think
I'm going to sit back

18:46.125 --> 18:48.418
and let you
lock your brain away

18:48.502 --> 18:50.045
in this Premiere Building jar,

18:50.045 --> 18:52.464
well, you got
another thing coming, kid.

18:56.093 --> 18:59.429
You came back from the dead
to give that speech?

19:00.722 --> 19:01.723
Next.

19:03.767 --> 19:05.102
You having a good time?

19:06.103 --> 19:07.521
It's easy,

19:07.521 --> 19:11.275
almost fun to dismiss
all these people who love you.

19:11.275 --> 19:12.568
Easier and more fun than

19:12.568 --> 19:15.070
actually dealing with
your problems,

19:15.070 --> 19:17.239
than actually
facing your grief.

19:17.239 --> 19:20.826
But you're not
the only one grieving,

19:21.660 --> 19:23.245
the only one hurting.

19:23.245 --> 19:27.583
I can't help you
if you withdraw from
everyone you care about,

19:27.583 --> 19:28.834
including me.

19:28.834 --> 19:31.086
And you can't help me either.

19:31.086 --> 19:33.422
And I need you, Gar.

19:34.464 --> 19:36.091
I need my brother.

19:38.760 --> 19:39.970
I'm sorry.

19:41.430 --> 19:44.016
I don't want to be needed.

19:44.016 --> 19:46.977
I can't take
being needed anymore,

19:46.977 --> 19:49.354
so stop telling me
how to fix myself.

19:49.438 --> 19:52.232
I'm doing this my way. Alone.

19:52.316 --> 19:53.317
Next.

19:53.317 --> 19:55.402
Oh, wait, that's everyone.

19:56.069 --> 19:57.654
The end.

19:57.738 --> 20:00.866
Fine, but there's one
thing you can't do alone.

20:00.866 --> 20:04.661
Black Lightning made
annual mental health checks mandatory.

20:04.745 --> 20:06.288
Yours is past due.

20:06.288 --> 20:08.916
So unless you're prepared to
permanently leave the Team,

20:08.916 --> 20:10.959
the Justice League
and the Outsiders,

20:11.043 --> 20:14.671
you have to attend
one therapy session
with Black Canary.

20:25.474 --> 20:28.101
All right, Kon-El.
On your feet.

20:28.185 --> 20:29.853
Time to make your next jump.

20:29.937 --> 20:32.147
Easy for you to say.
You can fly.

20:33.065 --> 20:34.983
Besides, what's the use?

20:35.067 --> 20:37.653
I'm nearly out of asteroids.

20:37.653 --> 20:39.321
They don't
lead anywhere anyway.

20:40.781 --> 20:42.741
I know what you're gonna say.

20:42.741 --> 20:46.828
Never give up. There are people
who love and need me.

20:46.912 --> 20:49.456
I just need to
believe in myself
the way they do,

20:50.624 --> 20:52.250
but it's hopeless.

20:54.878 --> 20:57.255
Come on, Kal,
you don't play fair.

20:57.339 --> 20:59.508
Please I'm all about fair play.

20:59.508 --> 21:00.676
Come on. I'll go first.

21:00.676 --> 21:02.052
Kal!

21:06.264 --> 21:07.724
Stop it. Stop!

21:17.609 --> 21:18.860
No.

21:34.209 --> 21:36.753
- What was that?
- This way. Over here.

21:39.339 --> 21:42.342
- Too close.
- I recognize that show of light.

21:42.426 --> 21:45.929
Because light shows are
totally my thing.

21:46.013 --> 21:49.224
Delphis,
would you like to join
our mission?

21:49.224 --> 21:52.060
Mm, I believe I already have.

22:00.110 --> 22:04.448
Wow. Did we know
the head up there
had a body down here?

22:06.491 --> 22:08.410
Cave in!

22:08.410 --> 22:09.536
Go, go!

22:11.997 --> 22:13.498
Kaldur, your drill.

22:13.582 --> 22:15.333
Shield yourselves!

22:20.338 --> 22:22.299
Moded.

22:23.800 --> 22:25.927
- Kaldur...
- I am fine, Wyynde.

22:26.011 --> 22:28.346
So, no turning back then?

22:28.430 --> 22:31.183
No. No turning back.

22:31.183 --> 22:33.268
We can dig our way out
when ready.

22:33.268 --> 22:35.562
But we have
a mission to complete
for our king.

22:44.029 --> 22:45.781
It is as I feared, Mera.

22:45.781 --> 22:47.574
The Orm
currently in our prison,

22:47.574 --> 22:51.495
spoke of our 16 visits together
during his prior incarceration.

22:52.537 --> 22:55.040
<i>Visits that never happened.</i>

22:55.040 --> 22:58.126
<i>I did go to the prison
16 times,</i>

22:58.210 --> 23:02.130
<i>but each time,
I chose to depart
without seeing him.</i>

23:02.214 --> 23:04.257
A fact this Orm did not know.

23:04.341 --> 23:07.135
I tracked down my brother's
former lieutenant, Danuuth,

23:07.219 --> 23:09.721
<i>who confirmed my suspicions.</i>

23:09.805 --> 23:11.473
<i>Before we captured this Orm,</i>

23:11.473 --> 23:13.100
<i>Danuuth spend a month with him.</i>

23:13.100 --> 23:15.060
<i>He said Orm's memories
of events</i>

23:15.060 --> 23:17.979
<i>after the true Ocean Master
was imprisoned,</i>

23:18.063 --> 23:20.107
<i>were spotty, at best.</i>

23:20.107 --> 23:22.943
So Danuuth came to believe
this Orm was an imposter.

23:22.943 --> 23:25.237
Not surprising, Annax.

23:25.237 --> 23:28.365
This new Orm
is a clone of the original.

23:28.365 --> 23:30.075
It was good work.

23:30.075 --> 23:32.160
If I had not been
looking for it,
I would not have found it.

23:32.244 --> 23:35.330
But why clone Orm?
Where is your actual brother?

23:35.330 --> 23:37.582
And what is his
and the Light's game?

23:37.666 --> 23:38.917
I am not sure,

23:38.917 --> 23:42.212
but I still suspect
the simultaneous arrivals

23:42.212 --> 23:44.923
of both the clone Orm
and the Prophecy's savior

23:44.923 --> 23:46.758
cannot be a coincidence.

23:46.842 --> 23:49.845
I need to have
another chat with Lord Arion.

23:49.845 --> 23:51.763
Then we have a problem.

23:51.847 --> 23:55.433
Arion has disappeared,
as has Chian.

23:55.517 --> 23:59.563
No one saw them leave,
and no one knows
where they went.

24:04.776 --> 24:06.153
<i>When Forager
looks back on Forager's journey</i>

24:06.153 --> 24:07.612
<i>to Class Valedictorian,</i>

24:07.696 --> 24:09.531
<i>Forager sees
Forager's greatest lessons</i>

24:09.531 --> 24:12.033
<i>came not only from
Forager's books and teachers,</i>

24:12.117 --> 24:15.871
<i>but also from
Forager's identity as Fred Bugg
with two Gs.</i>

24:15.871 --> 24:18.540
<i>Forager was once
just a frightened larva,</i>

24:18.540 --> 24:21.877
<i>foraging for friendship
and a future far from home.</i>

24:21.877 --> 24:23.461
<i>To blend in
among the Earth drones,</i>

24:23.545 --> 24:25.589
<i>Forager became Fred Bugg
with two Gs.</i>

24:25.589 --> 24:29.718
<i>Eventually, Forager felt
Fred Bugg with two Gs
was a lie,</i>

24:29.718 --> 24:32.637
<i>and a problem,
but problems can be lessons.</i>

24:32.721 --> 24:34.347
<i>And this lesson taught Forager</i>

24:34.431 --> 24:35.891
<i>that Fred Bugg with two Gs,</i>

24:35.891 --> 24:38.476
<i>was actually
Forager's pupa stage,</i>

24:38.560 --> 24:40.896
<i>readying Forager
to metamorphosize</i>

24:40.896 --> 24:42.898
<i>into a new Bug with one G,</i>

24:42.898 --> 24:46.067
<i>a true Outsider,
proudly standing up and out</i>

24:46.151 --> 24:48.195
<i>for all of Forager's
Earth Hive!</i>

24:48.195 --> 24:50.363
<i>So, now,
Forager gratefully urges</i>

24:50.447 --> 24:53.575

<i>to learn from
Forager's lesson of Gs,</i>

24:55.911 --> 24:57.495
<i>both two and one.</i>

24:57.579 --> 25:00.207
<i>Stand up, stand out, metamorphosize</i>

25:00.207 --> 25:02.209
<i>and forage the future!</i>
