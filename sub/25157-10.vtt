- You good?
- Yeah, I'm good.

13:11.124 --> 13:12.490
Listen, I look at you

13:12.500 --> 13:15.281
and I see Weimar, I see hyperinflation.

13:15.291 --> 13:17.865
I look at your face and, no
offense, but I see dead babies.

13:17.875 --> 13:21.239
- Well, that's very interesting.
- You know what I mean?

13:21.249 --> 13:24.907
I can't say I agree, but, um...

13:24.917 --> 13:26.989
Look, would you excuse me for a minute?

13:26.999 --> 13:30.031
Oh, yeah. Great to joust
a little, Senator.

13:30.041 --> 13:31.073
Yeah!

13:31.083 --> 13:32.531
That's the best he can do?

13:32.541 --> 13:34.139
Connor, he's gonna be
the next president.

13:34.150 --> 13:36.615
Really? I just wiped the
floor with him in a debate.

13:36.625 --> 13:38.698
He buckled under intellectual scrutiny.

13:38.708 --> 13:41.124
He was lucky that wasn't televised.

13:44.416 --> 13:46.657
Is it him?
You don't want a rocket launch

13:46.667 --> 13:49.573
'cause of Senator Bluhhh or whatever?

13:49.583 --> 13:52.948
Would it help if it was a rocket
full of Muslim granola?

13:52.958 --> 13:55.406
Roman, no, I just don't want
a rocket at my wedding.

13:55.416 --> 13:57.073
Stop being a kid.

13:57.083 --> 13:59.406
Oh. "I'm Shiv.
I'm an adult and I'm important"

13:59.416 --> 14:01.406
because I work for a man with glasses."

14:01.416 --> 14:02.657
Is he a Jew, by the way?

14:02.667 --> 14:04.198
- Oh, come on.
- What?

14:04.208 --> 14:07.281
It's just a simple, friendly,
slightly racist question.

14:07.291 --> 14:09.657
Oh, grrr! You used to be fun.

14:09.667 --> 14:11.239
When did you become one of them?

14:11.249 --> 14:13.365
- One of who?
- Like dancey bullshit,

14:13.375 --> 14:15.573
like, "Oh! We can't say that"
kind of people.

14:15.583 --> 14:17.907
I'm sorry I don't want
to come to your freewheelin',

14:17.917 --> 14:20.490
good-time, N-word-shoutin' hoedown.

14:20.500 --> 14:22.031
N-word, B-word, C-word...

14:22.041 --> 14:23.782
the world isn't fucking nursery school,

14:23.792 --> 14:25.296
and people don't like to be taught.

14:25.307 --> 14:26.782
- (PHONE CHIMING)
- Oh, right.

14:26.792 --> 14:28.406
Well, I'm glad you've
been watching our programs.

14:28.416 --> 14:30.109
You shouldn't do that, not with your IQ.

14:30.120 --> 14:32.406
Whoa-ho! Hardee-har-har.

14:32.416 --> 14:34.740
Excuse me. I actually have to go watch

14:34.750 --> 14:36.150
a fuckin' satellite launch in Japan

14:36.161 --> 14:38.113
that I'm actually in charge of,
that... Hold on!

14:38.124 --> 14:39.740
that I reorganized for you,

14:39.750 --> 14:42.365
but you're too fucking
carbon-neutral to enjoy.

14:42.375 --> 14:44.156
Yeah? Uh, yep, I got it.

14:44.166 --> 14:46.458
It's streaming, it's connecting.

14:47.958 --> 14:49.281
(GRUNTS)

14:49.291 --> 14:50.448
Yeah.

14:50.458 --> 14:52.281
OK, no. It's good. It's good.

14:52.291 --> 14:54.615
Wish everyone luck, OK?

14:54.625 --> 14:56.333
In Japanese, obviously.

15:02.333 --> 15:03.875
Come on.

15:05.166 --> 15:06.667
There we go.

15:24.667 --> 15:26.500

15:55.166 --> 15:56.667
That was really hard.

15:58.208 --> 15:59.375
Yeah, man.

16:04.249 --> 16:06.323
You fuckin' did it.

16:06.333 --> 16:07.865
Drinks.

16:07.875 --> 16:10.833
Drinks. Drinks, drinks,
drinks, drinks, drinks.

16:12.041 --> 16:13.865
Fuck yes, drinks.

16:13.875 --> 16:15.667
Yes.

16:19.541 --> 16:21.041
Um, Jess?

16:31.833 --> 16:34.323
- Hello.
- Celebration.

16:34.333 --> 16:36.750
It's a cele-fuckin'-bration.

16:38.416 --> 16:39.958
You did it, man.

16:41.792 --> 16:42.958
(SNORTS)

16:44.083 --> 16:46.406
(SNORTS) Oh! Yes.

16:46.416 --> 16:47.917
Wow, that's good.

16:51.249 --> 16:53.907
Are my pilots still on the clock?

16:53.917 --> 16:57.073
Check if any of them have
the hours to fly me home,

16:57.083 --> 16:58.406
or scheduled.

16:58.416 --> 17:00.792
But you don't want to look panicked.

17:02.041 --> 17:04.490
Huh? Yeah.

17:04.500 --> 17:06.290
Tomorrow, maybe.

17:08.290 --> 17:11.198
Gerri. Where are we on the...

17:11.208 --> 17:13.615
Oh. Emergency phone board
meeting for later.

17:13.625 --> 17:15.114
Tonight? Or is that tomorrow?

17:15.124 --> 17:16.615
Tomorrow.

17:16.625 --> 17:19.573
They're gonna have deeper
pockets, better prep.

17:19.583 --> 17:23.281
Find out where that fuckin'
shrunken California raisin is.

17:23.290 --> 17:25.573
The President. I think that's smart.

17:25.583 --> 17:27.656
Come on, come on. Let's go.

17:27.666 --> 17:30.782
The financials are hard.
We need political support.

17:30.792 --> 17:31.833
Let's get goin'.

17:35.375 --> 17:37.406
- CONNOR: Will.
- Hey.

17:37.416 --> 17:39.907
Listen, baby, I got something
I need to tell you.

17:39.917 --> 17:42.073
- OK. Is every...
- Um...

17:42.083 --> 17:43.406
Let's go over there.

17:43.416 --> 17:45.156
Right by the kings. This is perfect.

17:45.166 --> 17:47.114
- OK.
- Mm-K.

17:47.124 --> 17:49.114
- OK, listen...
- Yeah?

17:49.124 --> 17:51.406
I think I finally found
a job I want to do.

17:51.416 --> 17:52.573
OK, what is it?

17:52.583 --> 17:55.073
President of the United States.

17:55.083 --> 17:57.657
(SHORT CHUCKLE)

17:57.667 --> 17:59.323
Wh... OK. Wow.

17:59.333 --> 18:00.573
- Yeah?
- Really?

18:00.583 --> 18:02.281
You don't look excited.

18:02.291 --> 18:05.907
No, sure, sounds like a fun project.

18:05.917 --> 18:07.740
- Is this about the play?
- No.

18:07.750 --> 18:09.281
Because I loved it.

18:09.291 --> 18:11.782
Sure. You don't want to waste
your money putting in on,

18:11.792 --> 18:14.490
but running for president,
that's a sound investment?

18:14.500 --> 18:17.615
Plus, I'd be planning
to spend on, you know,

18:17.625 --> 18:20.073
making sure your history was cleaned up.

18:20.083 --> 18:22.156
The president, Willa. This is big.

18:22.166 --> 18:25.865
Sure, but you know, nothing's
more powerful than art.

18:25.875 --> 18:29.239
No, sure, you know, apart from the
power of the executive branch.

18:29.249 --> 18:30.989
Drama can change minds.

18:30.999 --> 18:32.323
Yeah, but not really.

18:32.333 --> 18:34.782
I could outlaw drama.
I mean, I never would,

18:34.792 --> 18:37.531
but I'm just illustrating
the power of the position.

18:37.541 --> 18:39.740
- OK.
- But, right. Art.

18:39.750 --> 18:40.865
CAROLINE: Roman?

18:40.875 --> 18:43.740
Meet Denis Linton.

18:43.750 --> 18:45.323
Denis is police,

18:45.333 --> 18:47.865
and he's also
the something commissioner?

18:47.875 --> 18:49.251
Police and Crime Commissioner.

18:49.262 --> 18:51.365
That's right. Anyway, he
knew your father and me

18:51.375 --> 18:53.365
back when he was doing
something even more boring.

18:53.375 --> 18:56.573
- Isn't that right, Denny?
- Thanks for lookin' after us.

18:56.583 --> 18:58.239
- Hey. How was it?
- Yeah?

18:58.249 --> 19:01.156

19:02.500 --> 19:04.406

He's been coordinating
a satellite launch.

19:06.750 --> 19:08.239
- Fascinating.
- How did it go?

19:08.249 --> 19:11.073
Uh, it, uh... Great, actually.
It went great.

19:11.083 --> 19:12.156
- Yes?
- Yeah.

19:12.166 --> 19:15.073
This is amazing. Congratulations!

- Well, you did, ya fucking prick.

19:52.875 --> 19:55.782
Go on, fuck off. Get out of here.
Fuck off!

- Stop mumbling.

19:58.208 --> 20:01.698
Don't look at me! Get the fuck out.

20:24.083 --> 20:27.156
Um, I'm very busy with...
on another matter,

20:27.166 --> 20:28.615
but are you across this?

20:28.625 --> 20:30.782
I've had 40 calls about the launch.

20:30.792 --> 20:32.740
Uh, unh-unh.

20:32.750 --> 20:35.073
No, that's weird. I haven't
gotten any, I don't think.

20:35.083 --> 20:37.573
- Yeah, it blew up.
- It blew up?

20:37.583 --> 20:40.239
Yes, it exploded on the launch pad.

20:40.249 --> 20:42.657
Um, OK. It's weird...

20:42.667 --> 20:45.281
Yeah, wow, they really
should have told me that.

20:45.291 --> 20:48.907
That's, um... that's naughty.

20:48.917 --> 20:51.657
How bad is it? Is it bad?

20:51.667 --> 20:53.490
I'll reiterate.

20:53.500 --> 20:54.782
It exploded.

20:54.792 --> 20:57.156
Pow! On the launch pad.

20:57.166 --> 20:59.907
So, yeah, I'd say that's bad.

20:59.917 --> 21:01.865
Are there, like, um...

21:01.875 --> 21:03.657
- Dead people?
- Yeah.

21:03.667 --> 21:05.198
Well, I don't know.

21:05.208 --> 21:07.823
Yes, I mean, the scale means
there's likely casualties.

21:07.833 --> 21:09.989
- It's very unclear.
- Mm-hmm.

21:09.999 --> 21:13.198
Because I did put a lot of
pressure to accelerate the launch,

21:13.208 --> 21:15.281
even though there were concerns.

21:15.291 --> 21:17.239
- You did?
- I did, yeah.

21:17.249 --> 21:18.308
Oh, fuck.

21:18.319 --> 21:19.698
I just thought it would be nice

21:19.708 --> 21:21.573
for it happen on Shiv's wedding day,

21:21.583 --> 21:23.554
like fireworks, like big fireworks?

21:23.565 --> 21:25.535
- Well, you got that right.
- I'm just telling you

21:25.546 --> 21:27.698
because I sent a lot of emails about it,

21:27.708 --> 21:29.948
and there's no use
hiding that, because...

21:29.958 --> 21:33.406
I just want to say I think it's for
you to know, as general counsel,

21:33.416 --> 21:36.823
so you can, um... protect me?

21:36.833 --> 21:38.865
Well, I can try.

21:38.875 --> 21:42.083
But fuck, you're looking at
potential corporate manslaughter.

22:40.208 --> 22:42.323
I'll never forget as long as I live.

22:42.333 --> 22:44.989
And I wanted it to be perfect...

22:44.999 --> 22:46.365
perfect... for Shiv.

22:46.375 --> 22:49.323
And it is.

22:49.333 --> 22:53.114
No one... no one can ruin this.

22:53.124 --> 22:55.907
It's wonderful to be surrounded

22:55.917 --> 23:00.490
by those that we love, trust,
and hold very dear.

23:00.500 --> 23:04.989
Because there is nothing
more important...

23:04.999 --> 23:07.448
than family.

23:07.458 --> 23:09.406
So...

23:09.416 --> 23:10.615

23:27.625 --> 23:30.156
so, how about we do London tomorrow?

23:30.166 --> 23:31.823
- Mm-hmm.
- OK.

23:31.833 --> 23:34.323
I put together a list of investor calls.

23:34.333 --> 23:36.281
Karl will make initial contact.

23:36.291 --> 23:39.531
And a poison pill...
should you consider it?

23:39.541 --> 23:43.031
Yeah. I will have the options
for our poison pill defense.

23:43.041 --> 23:45.281
So you have the president in 25,

23:45.291 --> 23:47.031
and the EU commissioner in the morning.

23:47.041 --> 23:48.740
- Yes?
- Yes.

23:48.750 --> 23:51.490
- Have you told the others?
- The others?

23:51.500 --> 23:52.989
The kids.

23:52.999 --> 23:54.698
N-No.

23:54.708 --> 23:56.573
Is there an advantage?

23:56.583 --> 24:00.531
N-No, I mean, just to, you
know, just to tell them.

24:00.541 --> 24:02.448
Oh. Yeah.

24:02.458 --> 24:04.031
- Yeah?
- Sure.

I don't feel like
I'm gaining a brother, either.

24:13.375 --> 24:16.031
- I don't feel anything.
- (LAUGHTER)

the bachelorette party?

24:24.875 --> 24:26.448
- I do!
- Yeah?

24:26.458 --> 24:27.740
Well, you're out of luck,

24:27.750 --> 24:30.114
'cause nothing happened, we just...

24:30.124 --> 24:34.490
we knitted and made salads,
did some yoga.

24:34.500 --> 24:36.823
And no one will tell you different,

24:36.833 --> 24:38.657
because we killed the stripper.

24:38.667 --> 24:41.198
- (LAUGHTER)
- But seriously, I would...

24:41.208 --> 24:42.740
I'd like to thank my dad...

24:42.750 --> 24:44.989
because I'm contractually obligated.

24:44.999 --> 24:48.365
No, I would actually like to thank you.

24:48.375 --> 24:50.907
And Tom, I would like to also thank

24:50.917 --> 24:52.750
for being my rock.

24:54.583 --> 24:57.573
- MAN: Aww...
- Aww...

24:57.583 --> 24:59.989
You're a good guy, Wambsgans,

24:59.999 --> 25:02.239
and I like hangin' out with you.

25:02.249 --> 25:04.448
- (MOUTHS WORDS)
- And so...

25:04.458 --> 25:08.323
here's a toast... to me...

25:08.333 --> 25:11.406
and to Tom.

25:11.416 --> 25:14.406
- (APPLAUSE)
- (BAND RESUMES)

25:14.416 --> 25:17.281
(NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE)

25:17.291 --> 25:19.573
CAROLINE: I just want to say

25:19.583 --> 25:22.573
I know we haven't
always seen eye-to-eye,

25:22.583 --> 25:25.239
but that's difficult when your father's

25:25.249 --> 25:27.698
stolen you away 'cross the Atlantic.

25:27.708 --> 25:31.073
And I know you probably think I'm
deliberately trying to make you cry

25:31.083 --> 25:33.448
or steal your limelight,

25:33.458 --> 25:36.448
but I just wanted to tell you,
in front of everybody,

25:36.458 --> 25:38.114
that you're special,

25:38.124 --> 25:40.989
and, after my own fashion, I love you.

25:40.999 --> 25:43.073
So I just wanted to say that in public,

25:43.083 --> 25:44.989
because I'm getting on

25:44.999 --> 25:46.907
and I might not be in good enough health

25:46.917 --> 25:48.281
to say it when you remarry.

25:48.291 --> 25:51.198
(LAUGHTER)

25:51.208 --> 25:55.281
I... love my wife.

25:55.291 --> 25:57.114
And I just...

25:57.124 --> 26:00.198
I just love saying the word "wife."

26:00.208 --> 26:02.989
- "Wife."
- (LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE)

26:02.999 --> 26:05.740
"Wife."

26:05.750 --> 26:06.989
"Wife. Wife."

26:06.999 --> 26:09.365
"Wife, wife, wife, wife, wife."

26:09.375 --> 26:12.573
So... she's my wife,

26:12.583 --> 26:15.281
and, um....

26:15.291 --> 26:16.823
she's my life.

26:16.833 --> 26:18.698
- And, uh...
- ALL: Aww...

26:18.708 --> 26:21.239
And I'm gonna stop talking now,

26:21.249 --> 26:24.073
because I feel like I'm gonna cry,

26:24.083 --> 26:25.865
and it would be crazy to cry,

26:25.875 --> 26:28.698
because I'm so happy right now.

26:28.708 --> 26:30.657
So, thank you all for coming,

26:30.667 --> 26:32.323
and I love you all.

26:32.333 --> 26:35.323
- ALL: Aww...
- (APPLAUDING)

26:35.333 --> 26:37.541
(BAND RESUMES)

26:43.667 --> 26:44.833
Oh!

26:49.625 --> 26:53.375
I'm gonna sit down.
My feet are killing me.

26:55.208 --> 26:58.323
Excuse me. Hey. Sorry. Could I...?

26:58.333 --> 26:59.875
Yeah. Of course.

27:06.750 --> 27:08.782
What was that text message
you sent before?

27:08.792 --> 27:10.865
Some kind of anti-proposal?

27:10.875 --> 27:12.740
"I won't do it if you won't"?

27:12.750 --> 27:16.448
Look, I just spoke to Gil,
and it sounds like,

27:16.458 --> 27:20.031
well, he thought he was being
very subtle and all,

27:20.041 --> 27:21.907
but something has happened,

27:21.917 --> 27:24.365
and I wondered what the fuck that was.

27:24.375 --> 27:25.948
Happened with what?

27:25.958 --> 27:28.531
In terms of burying
whatever it is we know

27:28.541 --> 27:30.531
and not being afraid of ATN anymore.

27:30.541 --> 27:32.989
Oh. Well, that's
an interesting perspective.

27:32.999 --> 27:34.490
I brought you in.

27:34.500 --> 27:35.989
What did I do?

27:35.999 --> 27:37.823
I'm gonna make him win.

27:37.833 --> 27:39.323
He's gonna win anyway.

27:39.333 --> 27:40.740
I might not agree.

27:40.750 --> 27:42.114
Well, yeah, look,

27:42.124 --> 27:43.948
I don't want to play
the bleeding heart here,

27:43.958 --> 27:45.782
but there is a reason I work with him,

27:45.792 --> 27:48.198
and it's because of...

27:48.208 --> 27:50.239
inequality, and...

27:50.249 --> 27:52.698
Oh! Inequality!

27:52.708 --> 27:55.907
Well, if you can't handle it,
then fuck off.

27:55.917 --> 27:57.323
Who are you?

27:57.333 --> 27:59.323
I'm Shiv fucking Roy.

27:59.333 --> 28:01.948
And I'm gonna have
two very grateful people...

28:01.958 --> 28:04.083
the next president and my father.

28:06.833 --> 28:08.198
LOGAN: Honey.

28:08.208 --> 28:09.573
I'm sorry, honey.

28:09.583 --> 28:12.323
I'm sorry, but you need
to talk to your brother.

28:12.333 --> 28:13.657
OK.

28:13.667 --> 28:15.907
You all need to chat.

28:15.917 --> 28:17.917
(BAND PLAYING)

28:26.750 --> 28:28.782
Excusez-moi. Hey, Kenny,

28:28.792 --> 28:29.999
can I grab a word with you?

28:32.625 --> 28:35.281
I'm sorry, bro...

28:35.291 --> 28:37.823
I didn't give you the full...

28:37.833 --> 28:40.031
full picture.

28:40.041 --> 28:41.907
Thanks, Con.

28:41.917 --> 28:44.114
Right.

28:44.124 --> 28:46.792
OK. OK.

28:48.625 --> 28:50.989
So what the fuck? Hmm?

28:50.999 --> 28:52.740
Dad told us.

28:52.750 --> 28:54.999
How could you?

28:58.333 --> 29:01.239
It, uh, it was out of my hands.

29:01.249 --> 29:05.198
- (LAUGHS)
- You're a real piece of work.

29:05.208 --> 29:07.823
You act like you're a fuckin'... guy,

29:07.833 --> 29:11.657
like a decent guy,
but you're a piece of shit, man.

29:11.667 --> 29:13.458
Look.

29:15.999 --> 29:19.490
- We can talk, yeah?
- Mm-hmm?

29:19.500 --> 29:22.281
There's no need to talk
to me like I'm the enemy.

29:22.291 --> 29:25.073
I think we get to talk to you
however we fuckin' want.

29:25.083 --> 29:28.531
The fact is, I was...
I was forced into this position

29:28.541 --> 29:30.657
against my wishes, I didn't want to...

29:30.667 --> 29:31.865
Poor Kendall.

29:31.875 --> 29:33.698
- Boo-fuckin'-hoo.
- Dude,

29:33.708 --> 29:35.542
I'll answer any questions you have.

29:35.553 --> 29:37.865
Great. I have a question.
What the fuck are you doing?

29:37.875 --> 29:40.531
I'm... I'm trying to save the company.

29:40.541 --> 29:43.198
By fucking us. Forever.

29:43.208 --> 29:44.907
Look, if this works,

29:44.917 --> 29:47.114
which undoubtedly it will,

29:47.124 --> 29:49.156
you'll all be very, very, very rich,

29:49.166 --> 29:52.114
and, I hate to say it,
but maybe it's for the best

29:52.124 --> 29:55.406
for this to no longer be
a family-run operation.

29:55.416 --> 29:58.031
Well, no, because, for one thing,

29:58.041 --> 30:01.073
our inheritance is all in
stock, so if after this

30:01.083 --> 30:03.490
Dad goes fuckin' nuts
and pisses it all away, nothing.

30:03.500 --> 30:06.365
CONNOR: Kendall, the fact is,
right now we're somebodies.

30:06.375 --> 30:08.865
Any doofus can have a few million bucks.

30:08.875 --> 30:10.823
- Come on.
- SHIV: Come on?

30:10.833 --> 30:13.615
You plotted a takeover! What
the fuck is wrong with you?

30:13.625 --> 30:17.156
To fundamentally alter the nature
of the family on my wedding day?

30:17.166 --> 30:20.531
Do you have any conception
of how goddamn selfish you are?!

30:20.541 --> 30:21.948
This isn't about a fuckin' dress.

30:21.958 --> 30:24.615
Fuck off! I know it's not
about a fucking dress!

30:24.625 --> 30:26.907
No, it's not. This is about the future,

30:26.917 --> 30:29.281
our future, this is about
the next thousand years!

30:29.291 --> 30:31.573
The Thousand-Year Reich? Uh-huh.

30:31.583 --> 30:33.416
That will endure for eternity.

30:34.625 --> 30:36.740
I mean, wake up.

30:36.750 --> 30:38.657
This is just a little maneuver.

30:38.667 --> 30:40.948
OK? You don't need to get sentimental.

30:40.958 --> 30:42.098
Sentimental?

30:42.109 --> 30:45.030
You think this is us just being
sentimental, just for the hell of it?

30:45.041 --> 30:47.573
The lack of thought
to do this to Dad... today...

30:47.583 --> 30:49.698
Come on, Shiv, let's not pretend.

30:49.708 --> 30:51.406
Yeah? This isn't about Dad.

30:51.416 --> 30:53.490
This is because you like the power.

30:53.500 --> 30:55.740
It gets you close to the Hill.

30:55.750 --> 30:58.281
And Rome, you couldn't get
a job in a fuckin' burger joint,

30:58.291 --> 31:00.657
let alone a Fortune 500,
without some nepotism.

31:00.667 --> 31:02.448
And Con, you like the glamor it gives

31:02.458 --> 31:04.907
to a fuckin' freak show in the desert.

31:04.917 --> 31:09.323
No, Kenny, I could just do with
the assistance of the family firm

31:09.333 --> 31:11.073
on my ambitions to become President.

31:11.083 --> 31:12.291
That's it.

31:13.541 --> 31:15.198
Right. Exactly.

31:15.208 --> 31:17.865
You're all living
in a fuckin' dream world.

31:17.875 --> 31:19.416
(DOOR OPENS)

31:24.458 --> 31:27.281
So...

31:27.291 --> 31:29.698
how's the torture going?

31:29.708 --> 31:33.907
I don't have to... I... I'm...
I... I ought to go. I...

31:33.917 --> 31:37.448
(SIGHS)I know what
you're trying to do, OK?

31:37.458 --> 31:40.948
I'm not gonna let you. I shouldn't
even talk to you right now.

31:40.958 --> 31:44.823
Oh, I don't think there's any
reason not to, legal or otherwise.

31:44.833 --> 31:46.114
I'm not getting into it.

31:46.124 --> 31:47.573
Uh-huh.

31:47.583 --> 31:51.865
So you don't think
that you owe us an explanation?

31:51.875 --> 31:54.156
I don't owe you anything. No.

31:54.166 --> 31:57.365
What have you had your entire
life that I didn't give you?

31:57.375 --> 32:00.615
I'm not getting into it.

32:00.625 --> 32:02.823
I'm doing this thing. OK?

32:02.833 --> 32:06.114
I don't owe you fucking anything.

32:06.124 --> 32:08.667
I blame myself.

32:10.667 --> 32:12.948
I spoiled you.

32:12.958 --> 32:15.999
And now... you're fucked.

32:17.124 --> 32:18.907
And I'm sorry.

32:18.917 --> 32:22.698
I'm sorry you're a hothouse flower...

32:22.708 --> 32:24.865
that you're nothing.

32:24.875 --> 32:27.448
You're curdled cream.

32:27.458 --> 32:30.073
Maybe... Maybe you should write a book

32:30.083 --> 32:33.365
or collect sports cars or something.

32:33.375 --> 32:36.541
But for the world? Nah.

32:38.041 --> 32:39.541
I'm sorry.

32:40.708 --> 32:42.375
You're not made for it.

32:48.208 --> 32:49.875
You're a fuckin' beast.

33:06.291 --> 33:07.416
(BEEPS)

33:19.166 --> 33:23.907
Yo, uh, do you have any more...?

33:23.917 --> 33:26.239
Uh-huh. Um, you know,

33:26.249 --> 33:28.365
it's just that tomorrow
maybe we should bo...

33:28.375 --> 33:29.740
We got a huge day tomorrow.

33:29.750 --> 33:31.406
- Sure.
- Yeah.

33:31.416 --> 33:33.657
You got, like, just a little, though,

33:33.667 --> 33:36.907
in case... in case we want for tomorrow?

33:36.917 --> 33:39.583
May... Uh, I don't know.

33:41.083 --> 33:44.323
- You want to look?
- Are we good, man?

33:44.333 --> 33:46.073
Are we good? Yeah. We're good.

33:46.083 --> 33:48.198
- We're golden.
- Yeah? Because Sandy

33:48.208 --> 33:52.615
wants us to check in at 2:00,
4:00, and 6:00, GMT.

33:52.625 --> 33:55.083
Wise, wise.

33:58.124 --> 34:00.615
Yeah, I can just do with a straightener.

34:00.625 --> 34:02.156
Take the edge off.

34:02.166 --> 34:04.083
Yeah, I just don't th...
I don't have any, man.

34:05.458 --> 34:07.625
I'm sorry about that.

34:10.625 --> 34:12.114
(BAND PLAYING)

34:12.123 --> 34:15.907
- ROMAN: for no reason.
- CONNOR: Shit. Did anyone die?

34:15.917 --> 34:17.281
I don't know. But it's fine.

34:17.291 --> 34:18.782
It's gonna be fine. Nobody... Yeah.

34:18.792 --> 34:20.614
Hey, were you... kidding

34:20.625 --> 34:22.614
about the presidential thing?

34:22.625 --> 34:24.239
No. Why?

34:24.248 --> 34:26.114
- Why?
- Yeah.

34:26.123 --> 34:27.531
Because, I mean,

34:27.541 --> 34:29.281
generally speaking,
people don't like you.

34:29.291 --> 34:31.322
Shut up. Shut up. You're an idiot.

34:31.333 --> 34:33.621
No, I could do that job.
I can do that job.

34:33.632 --> 34:35.822
But why would you even...
What do you want to do?

34:35.833 --> 34:38.782
Well, I would launch a campaign
against the Great Dangers.

34:38.792 --> 34:40.697
Wh... Eh... What are the Great Dangers?

34:40.708 --> 34:42.364
Honestly, this is from my readings,

34:42.375 --> 34:45.156
and sadly, you can't say this
because the permitted public debate

34:45.166 --> 34:46.947
has shrunk to the size of a fucking nut,

34:46.958 --> 34:49.489
but, frankly, usury and onanism.

34:49.500 --> 34:51.739
Usury an... anun... unoonan...

34:51.750 --> 34:53.406
Usury and onanism.

34:53.416 --> 34:55.447
Unsecured debt and masturbation.

34:55.458 --> 34:56.989
The spilling of good seed.

34:56.998 --> 34:58.265
That sounds dope.

34:58.276 --> 35:01.198
Well, it's not for public consumption.
I mean, this is from my readings.

35:01.208 --> 35:02.865
Well, yes, of course. Obviously.

35:02.875 --> 35:05.323
- And I don't want to pay tax.
- Well, duh. Gerri!

35:05.333 --> 35:08.073
CONNOR: Like a protest, like Thoreau.

35:08.083 --> 35:10.615
He had it right, let me tell ya.

35:10.625 --> 35:12.989
Did you hear yet? Did you hear anything?

35:12.999 --> 35:14.698
- About?
- Japan.

35:14.708 --> 35:16.031
Like, how many, like...

35:16.041 --> 35:17.865
how many died, how many did they find?

35:17.875 --> 35:19.531
- Yeah, you didn't hear?
- No.

35:19.541 --> 35:21.865
- None.
- None. Like "none" none,

35:21.875 --> 35:23.865
- none at all?
- No. Two guys lost thumbs,

35:23.875 --> 35:26.865
and there might be an arm they
can't save, but they might.

35:26.875 --> 35:29.823
Oh, my God. So you... you're...
Are you fuckin' kiddin' me?

35:29.833 --> 35:32.073
It's just an arm and a
couple of fucking thumbs?

35:32.083 --> 35:34.345
- It's so sad.
- Oh, my God, Jesus,

35:34.356 --> 35:36.067
no, that's great. Not gonna ruin a party

35:36.078 --> 35:38.865
over a couple of fuckin' thumbs.

35:38.875 --> 35:42.073
TOM: Hey, wait. Hey. Roman.
How ya doin'?

35:42.083 --> 35:43.615
- Uh, great.
- Listen, I'm sorry...

35:43.625 --> 35:44.865
about Kendall...

35:44.875 --> 35:46.698
No... That's... Hey. Guess...

35:46.708 --> 35:48.531
Guess who just didn't kill anyone,

35:48.541 --> 35:50.157
but maybe only lost a couple of thumbs?

35:50.168 --> 35:52.334
- I don't know.
- This guy.

35:59.708 --> 36:01.406
Hey.

36:01.416 --> 36:03.365
Hey.

36:03.375 --> 36:05.083
Hey, so I heard.

36:06.583 --> 36:09.740
- Yeah, well...
- I just want to say good luck.

36:09.750 --> 36:11.281
- Good luck?
- Yeah.

36:11.291 --> 36:14.156
The place has gotta change, I feel.

36:14.166 --> 36:16.698
Like the old shit, the nasty politics,

36:16.708 --> 36:20.657
like, the... the stuff
at the cruise lines?

36:20.667 --> 36:23.073
You know about that?

36:23.083 --> 36:25.615
Because I helped clean
it up, you know? But...

36:25.625 --> 36:27.708
Hey, so, listen. Um...

36:29.625 --> 36:33.073
Do you know where I can find, uh...

36:33.083 --> 36:36.448
I could use a little... sumpin'-sumpin'.

36:36.458 --> 36:39.239
I wish. But I, you know,

36:39.249 --> 36:42.281
I made copies of a few key documents

36:42.291 --> 36:44.073
related to all that stuff,

36:44.083 --> 36:45.989
in case I got into any trouble at all?

36:45.999 --> 36:49.615
So I would just think,
like, anybody would be wise

36:49.625 --> 36:51.583
to keep me in a good role.

36:57.375 --> 36:59.124
(CHUCKLING)

37:00.833 --> 37:02.833
Greg the motherfuckin' Egg.

37:05.291 --> 37:06.782
Look at you.

37:06.792 --> 37:08.782
Some guys smoke weed around the back

37:08.792 --> 37:10.573
I think might know.

37:10.583 --> 37:13.865
You little Machiavellian fuck.

37:13.875 --> 37:15.823
I see you, Greg.

37:15.833 --> 37:17.124
I like it.

37:19.667 --> 37:21.239
Hell yeah.

37:21.249 --> 37:22.823
Hey. Do you wanna talk about

37:22.833 --> 37:26.615
how this takeover
affects you in the business?

37:26.625 --> 37:28.948
- 'Cause... Ow. God.
- You look amazing.

37:28.958 --> 37:30.490
I mean, you're in on merit.

37:30.500 --> 37:33.198
- But if it's successful...
- You look amazing.

37:33.208 --> 37:36.156
you know, it'll be tough,
but I think you... you're good.

37:36.166 --> 37:37.989
I don't really care about that.

37:37.999 --> 37:41.156
All I care about is getting
into this beautiful dress.

37:41.166 --> 37:43.114
- If Gil takes off...
- Can I rip it?

37:43.124 --> 37:45.198
No. If Gil takes off, I don't even know

37:45.208 --> 37:47.111
if I want to go back inside,
especially now...

37:47.122 --> 37:49.448
Shiv. Shh. Let's just fuck.

37:49.458 --> 37:51.323
You're very forward, sir.

37:51.333 --> 37:52.989
- I'm very forward? Oh.
- Yes.

37:52.999 --> 37:55.531
You know, I don't care about our plan.

37:55.541 --> 37:58.073
I didn't get married to you
for the plan,

37:58.083 --> 38:00.239
or because, you know,

38:00.249 --> 38:03.323
I just... I know that
you're hard and you're tough,

38:03.333 --> 38:06.490
but I just want to get in,
I want in, I want in on you.

38:06.500 --> 38:08.198
You know? Let's go to...

38:08.208 --> 38:10.031
Let's go to fuckin' New Zealand,

38:10.041 --> 38:12.114
become sheep farmers.

38:12.124 --> 38:13.907
- Sheep farmers?
- Yeah.

38:13.917 --> 38:16.281
- Can you scuba?
- You know I can scuba.

38:16.291 --> 38:19.041
Well, let's go and teach scuba then.
Let's get out!

38:20.249 --> 38:22.375
You think? (LAUGHS)

38:28.041 --> 38:29.948
Tom, I gotta tell you something.

38:29.958 --> 38:33.208
And I should have told you before.

38:35.249 --> 38:37.823
Uh...

38:37.833 --> 38:40.041
I've had a little number.

38:42.583 --> 38:43.907
You had a little number?

38:43.917 --> 38:45.375
Yeah.

38:49.416 --> 38:52.657
And... you know, because I thought

38:52.667 --> 38:55.416
we were both grownups
and we had an agreement.

38:57.083 --> 39:00.583
That we were gonna behave
in a very grownup manner.

39:04.583 --> 39:07.073
Right. Did we?

39:07.083 --> 39:08.239
Well, yeah, I mean,

39:08.249 --> 39:11.239
I always implied, I thought.

39:11.249 --> 39:12.583
OK.

39:13.917 --> 39:16.031
Do you want to say who?

39:16.041 --> 39:19.198
And if I've got it wrong, then
I'm really, truly fuckin' sorry.

39:19.208 --> 39:20.907
What it Nate?

39:20.917 --> 39:23.573
I want everything to be open
and honest from now on.

39:23.583 --> 39:25.323
Can I send him home?

39:25.333 --> 39:27.156
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

39:27.166 --> 39:29.333
- Yeah, sure.
- Good.

39:31.958 --> 39:33.291
Tom.

39:34.667 --> 39:35.792
I'm...

39:37.416 --> 39:40.124
I just think I'm... just...

39:42.541 --> 39:46.615
I'm just not sure I'm a good
fit for a monogamous marriage.

39:46.625 --> 39:48.291
Right.

39:49.500 --> 39:51.323
- OK.
- Is it OK?

39:51.333 --> 39:54.198
- Is that OK to say to you?
- Of course.

39:54.208 --> 39:57.406
Yeah. I kinda wish, I guess,

39:57.416 --> 40:01.531
maybe we'd talked about this
before our wedding night.

40:01.541 --> 40:04.166
Yeah. Me too.

40:10.166 --> 40:13.281
I just think I was in such a total mess

40:13.291 --> 40:14.740
when we hooked up,

40:14.750 --> 40:16.698
and I needed you, so much,

40:16.708 --> 40:18.615
I was in a very bad way,

40:18.625 --> 40:20.865
and we've got the business angle
that works,

40:20.875 --> 40:23.615
we're good on that, we have a plan.

40:23.625 --> 40:24.989
Uh-huh.

40:24.999 --> 40:27.328
But in terms of the relationship,
I'm just wondering

40:27.339 --> 40:29.323
if there's an opportunity
for something different

40:29.333 --> 40:31.833
from the whole box set death march.

40:33.833 --> 40:35.989
The box set death march.

40:35.999 --> 40:38.281
Yeah.

40:38.291 --> 40:42.198
You know, just a different
shape of relationship.

40:42.208 --> 40:43.740
It could be exciting.

40:43.750 --> 40:45.166
Right.

40:46.291 --> 40:47.865
Maybe, I guess. Yeah.

40:47.875 --> 40:49.490
- It's exciting!
- It's exciting.

40:49.500 --> 40:52.782
Yeah! Because we've
torn everything else down.

40:52.792 --> 40:55.907
Right? Love is
the last fridge magnet left.

40:55.917 --> 40:58.989
Right. How do you mean?

40:58.999 --> 41:01.233
Well, I mean that love is...

41:01.796 --> 41:03.659
it's like 28 different things,

41:03.670 --> 41:05.823
and they all get lumped in
together in this one sack,

41:05.833 --> 41:08.295
and there's a lot of...

41:08.306 --> 41:10.378
things in that sack, it
needs to get emptied out.

41:10.389 --> 41:14.281
There's fear and jealousy and revenge,

41:14.291 --> 41:16.989
control, and...

41:16.999 --> 41:20.073
they all get wrapped up in really
nice fuckin' wrapping paper,

41:20.083 --> 41:22.406
and it just looks
really lovely and nice,

41:22.416 --> 41:24.698
- but when you open it up...
- No, no. You're right.

41:24.708 --> 41:25.865
It is. It's...

41:25.875 --> 41:28.740
Love. It's bullshit.

41:28.750 --> 41:29.792
Yes!

41:31.917 --> 41:34.531
But I... I do love you.

41:34.541 --> 41:37.865
I love you too.

41:37.875 --> 41:39.406
Fuck.

41:39.416 --> 41:40.458
Fuck!

41:45.416 --> 41:48.073
- I want to get this dress off.
- Get the dress off.

41:48.083 --> 41:50.208
(BOTH LAUGHING)

41:59.625 --> 42:01.041
Hey.

42:02.375 --> 42:04.365
Hey.

42:04.375 --> 42:05.833
What's up, man?

42:07.708 --> 42:10.323
What you, uh, what you got
goin' on back here?

42:10.333 --> 42:13.323
- Nothin'.
- No, it's cool, it's cool.

42:13.333 --> 42:15.239
You can just smell it from down there.

42:15.249 --> 42:17.615
It smells like the kind bud.

42:17.625 --> 42:19.406
Uh-huh.

42:19.416 --> 42:22.448
Hey, didn't I see you
get some shit earlier?

42:22.458 --> 42:24.907
You OK? My dad's a fuckin' bastard.

42:24.917 --> 42:26.198
Yeah.

42:26.208 --> 42:28.490
No, yeah, it's cool. They paid me up.

42:28.500 --> 42:31.239
- For like the whole shift?
- Yeah.

42:31.249 --> 42:33.323
And a sweetener.

42:33.333 --> 42:35.782
- Nice.
- It's actually pretty good,

42:35.792 --> 42:37.281
'cause now I can just go home.

42:37.291 --> 42:38.865
- Nice. Nice.
- Yeah.

42:38.875 --> 42:41.531
Uh, dude...

42:41.541 --> 42:43.365
would it be weird to ask if, uh...

42:43.375 --> 42:45.323
Oh, do you want a smoke?

42:45.333 --> 42:47.031
- Uh, yeah, sure.
- Here.

42:47.041 --> 42:49.657
But... But also... you know,

42:49.667 --> 42:52.573
for the party, like, big party tonight,

42:52.583 --> 42:56.698
and I just wondered,
you don't have a connection

42:56.708 --> 42:59.281
for some powder, do you?

42:59.291 --> 43:00.865
(LAUGHS QUIETLY)

43:00.875 --> 43:01.933
Uh...

43:03.333 --> 43:04.391
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

43:07.083 --> 43:09.667

Yeah. I'm serious.
