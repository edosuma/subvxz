00:19.752 --> 00:21.192
Henry...

00:30.830 --> 00:32.729
What are you doing?

00:32.765 --> 00:35.705
Come on.

01:07.733 --> 01:09.373
Jesus!

01:19.778 --> 01:21.678
You paralyzed me.

01:24.383 --> 01:26.383
I just saved you.

01:26.418 --> 01:28.458
How d... what are you?

01:31.390 --> 01:34.890
You did this to me.

01:34.927 --> 01:36.867
You fucking bitch.

01:36.896 --> 01:38.636
You tried to kill me!

01:38.664 --> 01:40.264
I...

01:40.299 --> 01:42.469
You tried to kill me.
You're a goddamned monster!

01:42.501 --> 01:44.201
I...

01:44.236 --> 01:46.176
You tried to rape me!

01:46.205 --> 01:47.916
You could've stopped, but you wouldn't.
You wouldn't!

01:47.940 --> 01:49.410
I'm gonna tell everyone.

01:49.441 --> 01:51.881
I'm gonna fucking tell everyone

01:51.911 --> 01:53.151
what you did to me!

01:53.179 --> 01:54.409
I'm gonna tell everyone

01:54.446 --> 01:55.646
what you are!

02:10.863 --> 02:13.563
Good luck with that.

02:15.267 --> 02:17.167
No one

02:17.203 --> 02:18.703
is going to believe you.

02:21.340 --> 02:22.940
The Boone name
doesn't mean shit anymore.

02:24.443 --> 02:28.183
Your dad is in jail.

02:28.214 --> 02:31.254
The DEA just caught him
for drug trafficking.

02:33.953 --> 02:35.397
You don't know
what you're talking about.

02:35.421 --> 02:36.661
And your brother is on the run

02:36.689 --> 02:38.459
for murder.

02:38.490 --> 02:40.630
He murdered Amos Miller.

02:40.659 --> 02:41.659
Did you know that?

02:41.694 --> 02:43.264
Lucas wouldn't...

02:43.295 --> 02:44.495
No.

02:48.234 --> 02:49.464
Look at me.

02:49.501 --> 02:51.341
You don't have anyone

02:51.370 --> 02:52.840
to hide behind anymore.

02:52.871 --> 02:54.371
Just get me the fuck
out of here!

02:54.406 --> 02:55.876
Everyone in this town's
gonna know.

02:55.908 --> 02:59.348
They will see you, Clay.

02:59.378 --> 03:01.418
They will finally see
what you are.

03:03.282 --> 03:05.822
Your life is fucking over.

04:21.493 --> 04:23.993
Jesus, Townes,
what are you doing here?

04:24.029 --> 04:25.969
I let myself in.

04:25.998 --> 04:27.898
Jenna told me
where to find the spare key,

04:27.933 --> 04:30.373
but you shouldn't hide it
under the welcome mat.

04:30.402 --> 04:32.502
It's the first place
robbers look.

04:32.538 --> 04:34.308
I thought that was something
everyone knew,

04:34.340 --> 04:36.051
since it's a universally stupid
thing to do.

04:36.075 --> 04:37.515
Jenna called you?

04:37.543 --> 04:39.313
I'm supposed to text her.

04:39.345 --> 04:41.845
Since I live closer, I said
I'd check your bedroom.

04:41.880 --> 04:44.020
She was worried
you'd burned to death.

04:44.049 --> 04:47.049
I knew your body
would protect you.

04:48.554 --> 04:50.754
What was that?

04:50.789 --> 04:53.629
Um...

04:53.659 --> 04:55.699
It's Clay Boone. He's...

04:55.728 --> 04:58.928
Did you...
Did you teleport with him here?

04:58.964 --> 05:00.334
Out... out of the fire?

05:02.701 --> 05:04.671
So you saved his life.

05:04.703 --> 05:07.573
No, I don... it just happened.

05:07.606 --> 05:08.576
Please don't. I'm not...

05:08.607 --> 05:09.847
You're a superhero.

05:09.875 --> 05:11.645
Not in the traditional sense
of the word,

05:11.677 --> 05:13.047
since you do drugs

05:13.078 --> 05:14.918
and have a genuine disdain
for people...

05:14.947 --> 05:16.117
Townes...

05:16.148 --> 05:17.548
Right. Sorry.

05:17.583 --> 05:20.683
I know
you don't appreciate praise.

05:20.719 --> 05:21.889
Or enthusiasm.

05:21.920 --> 05:25.660
It's just that he's...

05:25.691 --> 05:29.891
He saw me when I...

05:29.928 --> 05:31.828
And I don't think
that he would tell anyone,

05:31.864 --> 05:33.704
- but if...
- Don't worry.

05:33.732 --> 05:34.932
We'll get him on our side.

05:34.967 --> 05:37.037
Maybe he can even
be part of the team.

05:37.069 --> 05:40.039
No, I just need him out of here.

05:44.710 --> 05:46.080
Townes...

05:48.781 --> 05:51.451
Look, you're my sidekick, right?

05:55.053 --> 05:56.653
If you say so.

05:56.688 --> 05:58.788
Well, you are,

05:58.824 --> 06:01.364
and I need your help, so...

06:05.697 --> 06:07.837
What can I do?

06:14.840 --> 06:17.780
Shit. Shit.

06:17.810 --> 06:19.810
God.

06:31.490 --> 06:32.930
Officer, I... I know
I was speeding,

06:32.958 --> 06:34.102
but I can explain. I promise...

06:34.126 --> 06:35.666
- Stop!
- Okay.

06:35.694 --> 06:37.194
Place your hands on your head!

06:37.229 --> 06:38.469
I'm sorry.

06:38.497 --> 06:39.867
I'm Cleo Coles. Lucas Boone

06:39.898 --> 06:42.138
put me in this car, and I just...

06:42.167 --> 06:44.467
Do you have any ID on you?

06:44.503 --> 06:45.573
No, I don't.

06:45.604 --> 06:46.604
Officer Bennett,

06:46.638 --> 06:48.138
responding to the APB

06:48.173 --> 06:49.543
- on the gray Chevy Impala.
- 10-4.

06:49.575 --> 06:50.652
So... so you know what happened?

06:50.676 --> 06:52.216
You know...

06:52.244 --> 06:53.544
I have to bring you in.

06:53.579 --> 06:54.856
Please let me go
to the hospital.

06:54.880 --> 06:56.950
I need to see my daughter.
Please.

06:56.982 --> 06:59.052
It won't take long.

07:23.942 --> 07:25.142
What's he doing here?

07:25.177 --> 07:27.817
Henry saved his life.

07:30.048 --> 07:32.048
- Do you need help?
- Yeah, grab a leg.

07:32.084 --> 07:34.784
Fuck, fuck! Just put me down.

07:44.730 --> 07:46.630
When are these things
coming off?

07:46.665 --> 07:47.965
I signed all the paperwork.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.840
They're just following protocol.

07:50.869 --> 07:52.647
Well, they wouldn't have
anything on Jeremiah Miller

07:52.671 --> 07:55.111
if it wasn't for me.

07:55.140 --> 07:57.540
We should talk about Lucas.

07:57.576 --> 07:59.816
They've taken his immunity
off the table

07:59.845 --> 08:01.715
because of
a potential murder charge,

08:01.747 --> 08:02.947
and now kidnapping.

08:02.981 --> 08:04.651
That's not what happened.

08:04.683 --> 08:06.753
Look, Lu...

08:06.785 --> 08:07.955
Lucas gets scared.

08:07.986 --> 08:09.986
I can do my best to protect him,

08:10.022 --> 08:12.792
but you may need to... distance
yourself from this, legally.

08:12.824 --> 08:14.764
- He's my son.
- And my son's given

08:14.793 --> 08:16.093
me nothing but fucking sciatica

08:16.128 --> 08:18.168
and heartburn, so...

08:18.196 --> 08:20.496
They don't always
make it easy on us, do they?

08:23.235 --> 08:24.775
Listen, Bill,

08:24.803 --> 08:28.143
this deal isn't some
get-out-of-jail-free card.

08:28.173 --> 08:30.573
The FBI doesn't fuck around.

08:30.609 --> 08:32.208
They've frozen your assets.
That mean...

08:32.244 --> 08:34.844
Mr. Boone.

08:34.880 --> 08:36.880
I got nothing to say to you.
Talk to my lawyer,

08:36.914 --> 08:40.215
or send someone in here
with actual authority.

08:40.251 --> 08:41.722
I just thought
you'd want to know

08:41.753 --> 08:43.893
there was a fire at your house.

08:43.922 --> 08:45.162
What?

08:45.190 --> 08:46.830
We're not sure how it started
just yet,

08:46.858 --> 08:49.258
but most of the blaze
has been contained.

08:49.294 --> 08:51.834
W-wait, please.

08:51.863 --> 08:55.003
My... my son, Clay... he was home.

08:56.668 --> 08:58.268
There was no sign of anyone
at the house.

08:58.303 --> 08:59.803
Well, you gotta let me
out of here.

08:59.838 --> 09:01.049
I got to find him
and make sure he's okay.

09:01.073 --> 09:02.573
Well, Bill, I'm not sure

09:02.608 --> 09:04.748
I have the authority.

09:04.776 --> 09:06.216
I'll see you in the morning.

09:13.652 --> 09:15.952
Your mom's safe.

09:15.988 --> 09:17.865
My dad's driving her
back from the police station.

09:17.889 --> 09:19.829
She's okay?

09:19.858 --> 09:21.258
Which means
they'll be here soon.

09:21.293 --> 09:22.363
We need to get rid of him.

09:22.394 --> 09:25.134
I can take him somewhere,

09:25.163 --> 09:26.363
but I don't know where.

09:26.398 --> 09:27.868
You can leave him on the side

09:27.899 --> 09:30.099
of the road for all I care.

09:30.135 --> 09:31.605
I can go with you.

09:31.637 --> 09:33.207
I say we take him
to the hospital.

09:33.238 --> 09:34.878
The burns on his legs
look pretty bad.

09:36.008 --> 09:37.378
You should stay here.

09:37.409 --> 09:38.679
Wait for your mom.

09:40.812 --> 09:42.082
Good.

09:44.182 --> 09:46.022
Let him be
the hospital's problem.

09:57.396 --> 09:58.936
I need to be able to hear

09:58.964 --> 10:00.375
if someone's honking,
or if there are

10:00.399 --> 10:02.769
any other outside noises
related to our safety.

10:09.841 --> 10:12.381
Have you known
this whole time, Jenna?

10:12.411 --> 10:14.111
What she did to me?

10:14.146 --> 10:15.116
What's he talking about?

10:15.147 --> 10:17.347
Nothing.

10:17.382 --> 10:19.122
So you don't give a shit.

10:20.752 --> 10:23.192
That fucking freak crushed my
legs, and you're just like,

10:23.221 --> 10:24.721
"Cool, whatever."

10:24.756 --> 10:27.056
What about what you did to her?

10:27.092 --> 10:29.132
- What did he do?
- I didn't do anything to her.

10:29.161 --> 10:30.831
Bullshit. Take some

10:30.862 --> 10:32.662
fucking responsibility
for once in your life.

10:32.698 --> 10:34.275
Jesus Christ, man.
You make it seem like.

10:34.299 --> 10:35.999
I... fucking drugged her
or something.

10:36.034 --> 10:37.104
It wasn't like that.

10:37.135 --> 10:40.905
You assaulted her.

10:43.942 --> 10:45.412
Whoa, Townes,
get the fuck off me!

10:45.444 --> 10:47.144
- Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Townes. Townes.

10:47.179 --> 10:48.779
- Townes!
- Calm the fuck down, man.

10:48.814 --> 10:50.134
- Get off me!
- He isn't worth it!

10:51.249 --> 10:54.789
Okay? He's not worth it.

10:57.823 --> 10:59.823
It's okay.

11:21.346 --> 11:24.016
I'll drop you at the hospital,
because Henry is my friend,

11:24.049 --> 11:26.049
and that's what I told her
I would do.

11:35.360 --> 11:36.730
Henry.

11:36.762 --> 11:39.002
Henry!

11:40.432 --> 11:41.472
Hi.

11:50.408 --> 11:52.078
I should take you
back to the hospital.

11:52.110 --> 11:53.287
You shouldn't be up,
walking around.

11:53.311 --> 11:56.111
No, Mom, I'm fine.
I'm really okay.

11:56.148 --> 11:57.948
I'm okay.

11:57.983 --> 11:59.983
Are you okay?

12:00.018 --> 12:02.096
What happened at Boone Motors?
What happened with Lucas?

12:02.120 --> 12:03.840
Don't worry about that.
That doesn't matter.

12:08.260 --> 12:09.730
Do you want to talk about it?

12:12.564 --> 12:14.164
Not really.

12:14.199 --> 12:15.399
Okay.

12:19.337 --> 12:20.907
Um...

12:22.974 --> 12:24.444
He didn't...

12:24.476 --> 12:26.116
rape me.

12:28.079 --> 12:29.349
Like, just...

12:29.381 --> 12:30.451
so you know,

12:30.482 --> 12:32.782
it wasn't as bad as...

12:34.419 --> 12:36.419
Like, a lot
of people have it worse.

12:36.454 --> 12:40.124
Don't do that.

12:40.158 --> 12:42.858
Don't lessen what happened
to you, or how much it hurts.

12:45.030 --> 12:46.470
It won't take it away.

12:49.367 --> 12:53.207
Yeah, it's just that, um...

12:53.238 --> 12:56.138
It's just that I kissed him.

12:56.174 --> 12:57.474
You know, we were making out,

12:57.509 --> 13:00.309
and I...

13:00.345 --> 13:02.445
I wanted to, like, at first.

13:02.480 --> 13:04.520
I wanted to, so...

13:04.549 --> 13:06.119
But then you didn't.

13:10.288 --> 13:12.358
We should go to the police.

13:12.390 --> 13:14.190
No.

13:14.226 --> 13:15.503
He needs to be held accountable.

13:15.527 --> 13:18.297
Mom, he's paraplegic,

13:18.330 --> 13:19.370
so...

13:24.236 --> 13:26.536
I mean, it's not like
he's gonna...

13:28.907 --> 13:31.607
He can't... hurt anyone again,

13:31.643 --> 13:34.243
and the cops aren't
gonna do anything, so...

13:34.279 --> 13:35.919
You don't know that.

13:37.048 --> 13:39.618
I do,

13:39.651 --> 13:41.391
and that's not what I need.

13:44.222 --> 13:47.922
I just...

13:47.959 --> 13:50.159
Just need to be able
to not see him.

13:55.133 --> 13:57.233
Just need to be able
to go outside

13:57.269 --> 14:00.309
and go to school

14:00.338 --> 14:03.078
and have a life and not see him.

14:08.446 --> 14:11.186
I don't know how to fix this.

14:14.486 --> 14:16.486
I wish I did, I wish more
than anything I did,

14:16.521 --> 14:18.491
but I don't.

14:18.523 --> 14:20.063
Yeah.

14:23.061 --> 14:24.261
Me neither.

14:51.556 --> 14:54.626
I can't... believe
that you like this movie.

14:54.659 --> 14:56.299
Hey, it has its moments.

14:58.063 --> 15:00.033
It's worse than I remember,
but...

15:05.370 --> 15:07.610
What if we left?

15:12.510 --> 15:13.550
What do you mean?

15:13.578 --> 15:15.648
Maybe it's time to go,

15:15.680 --> 15:18.320
to leave Reston,
just you and me.

15:18.350 --> 15:19.550
Fresh start.

15:22.053 --> 15:24.123
- Mom...
- No, it's not like the other times.

15:24.155 --> 15:25.255
That's not what I mean.

15:27.392 --> 15:30.062
But I dragged you here,
and I just...

15:30.095 --> 15:32.065
expected you to
take to this place.

15:32.097 --> 15:33.377
It's caused you
nothing but pain.

15:35.600 --> 15:37.070
I didn't see it.

15:40.472 --> 15:45.012
I didn't... see what
you needed, but now, I do.

15:46.778 --> 15:48.318
I want you to be happy.

15:55.286 --> 15:58.256
What about Thomas and Jenna?

15:58.289 --> 16:00.289
Well, this is their home.
It's not ours.

16:02.494 --> 16:05.134
You and me... we're family.
We're all we need.

16:13.605 --> 16:15.145
You love him, Mom.

16:21.813 --> 16:23.783
I love you more.

16:28.820 --> 16:31.290
Promise me you'll take tomorrow
to think about it.

16:32.624 --> 16:33.624
Okay?

16:37.162 --> 16:38.232
Okay.

16:50.308 --> 16:52.778
We got word this morning.
Clay's in the ER.

16:52.811 --> 16:54.081
Minor injuries.

17:03.655 --> 17:07.095
Making yourself comfortable,
I see.

17:07.125 --> 17:09.165
Sorry about your friend.

17:11.296 --> 17:12.766
Will you sign here, please?

17:27.112 --> 17:28.452
Is that it?

17:28.480 --> 17:30.580
You're officially a free man.

17:41.626 --> 17:43.326
The FBI... is seizing

17:43.361 --> 17:45.161
all Bill Boone's assets,

17:45.196 --> 17:47.396
including all of his properties,

17:47.432 --> 17:50.432
so... that means
the bowling alley.

17:52.303 --> 17:53.603
No.

17:53.638 --> 17:55.378
No, no.
We didn't do anything wrong.

17:55.406 --> 17:57.146
We're not even a part of
that stuff.

17:57.175 --> 17:59.115
Doesn't matter.
Doesn't make a difference.

17:59.144 --> 18:01.284
It's on his land,

18:01.312 --> 18:02.552
and I'm not telling you this

18:02.580 --> 18:05.550
because I want you to worry.

18:05.583 --> 18:07.623
I just wanted you
to hear it from me.

18:09.387 --> 18:12.257
At... least I got you, right?

18:12.290 --> 18:14.160
My girl, my constant.

18:14.192 --> 18:16.392
Yeah.

18:18.796 --> 18:21.396
Are you okay?

18:21.432 --> 18:22.832
Yeah.

18:22.867 --> 18:24.337
I'm good.

18:26.204 --> 18:27.444
Come here.

18:36.481 --> 18:37.621
Clay.

18:43.688 --> 18:46.428
What are you doing here?

18:46.457 --> 18:47.697
The hospital called me.

18:47.725 --> 18:49.395
They couldn't reach your father.

18:52.897 --> 18:54.867
How are you feeling?

18:54.899 --> 18:58.199
You don't have to pretend
to give a shit.

18:58.236 --> 19:01.606
You came here.
You fulfilled your duty.

19:01.639 --> 19:03.309
I'm fine.

19:07.946 --> 19:11.346
You have every right
to be angry with me.

19:11.382 --> 19:15.222
Clay, your dad has made
some poor choices, and...

19:15.253 --> 19:17.223
I don't know
what's gonna happen,

19:17.255 --> 19:19.955
but he's gonna have to live
with the consequences, and...

19:19.991 --> 19:23.761
I doubt it'll be
the same as it was.

19:23.795 --> 19:25.295
So I was thinking,

19:25.330 --> 19:29.470
I was hoping,

19:29.500 --> 19:32.200
that maybe you would come and live
with me and Robert for a while.

19:33.905 --> 19:35.775
I live here.

19:35.807 --> 19:37.477
Of course you do.

19:45.016 --> 19:47.256
I know that we don't know
each other very well.

19:49.454 --> 19:51.824
But I would like to change that.

19:53.858 --> 19:56.928
I would really like
to be a part of your life.

20:15.346 --> 20:16.916
Can we wait here
for a couple minutes?

20:20.318 --> 20:21.318
Sure.

20:32.730 --> 20:34.870
Do you have any marijuana?

20:36.701 --> 20:38.871
Yeah, I have a joint.

20:40.738 --> 20:41.838
Do you want to smoke it?

20:43.574 --> 20:45.974
Is Jenna Faith Hope
seriously asking

20:46.010 --> 20:49.510
to get high in
the school parking lot?

20:49.547 --> 20:51.747
She is.

20:51.783 --> 20:54.523
Okay.

21:29.887 --> 21:32.587
Do you think that guy
is coming back?

21:32.623 --> 21:34.063
The teleporter?

21:35.526 --> 21:37.496
Because if...

21:37.528 --> 21:40.668
If he doesn't, that could mean
that he's dead.

21:40.698 --> 21:43.098
Right?

21:43.134 --> 21:44.934
And if he's dead, then I'm...

21:47.572 --> 21:50.672
And if he isn't, then he knows
where we live.

21:55.713 --> 21:57.453
I don't know.

22:04.722 --> 22:07.962
What if I die
before I get to do...

22:07.992 --> 22:09.932
anything I really want?

22:13.698 --> 22:14.898
That's kind of morbid, Jenna.

22:14.932 --> 22:16.102
No, I mean it.

22:19.103 --> 22:20.843
Well, what do you want?

22:29.947 --> 22:33.757
I don't know.

22:33.785 --> 22:35.885
But I... I can't remember
the last time

22:35.920 --> 22:36.997
that I wasn't thinking about

22:37.021 --> 22:39.461
what I should do or say

22:39.490 --> 22:41.460
to make someone else happy.

22:43.194 --> 22:44.564
You wouldn't understand.

22:46.731 --> 22:49.671
Okay.

22:49.700 --> 22:52.570
It's like, I always have to
act so perfect.

22:52.603 --> 22:54.743
Yeah, you... you don't have to.

22:54.772 --> 22:56.942
You choose to.

22:56.974 --> 22:59.844
No, this is what
I'm talking about.

22:59.877 --> 23:03.447
Like you. You... you don't
care what people think.

23:04.782 --> 23:07.082
You're just you.

23:07.118 --> 23:08.618
I care.

23:10.054 --> 23:11.954
Not like I do.

23:11.989 --> 23:15.999
Well, no one cares
as much as you do, Jenna.

23:19.130 --> 23:23.440
I haven't always been this way.

23:23.468 --> 23:25.538
We just move around,

23:25.570 --> 23:28.010
like, so much that
I don't have time to...

23:30.775 --> 23:34.175
You know. I don't know.

23:34.212 --> 23:35.882
And you grew up here.

23:35.913 --> 23:36.953
It's different.

23:36.981 --> 23:38.551
It's been, like,

23:38.583 --> 23:41.523
fucking ingrained in you
since elementary school

23:41.552 --> 23:44.122
to care what Patty Yang
thinks of you.

23:46.724 --> 23:48.224
Yeah.

23:48.259 --> 23:50.459
But I don't know.

23:50.495 --> 23:54.165
Who you are
and who you want to... be

23:54.198 --> 23:56.538
or whatever.

23:56.567 --> 23:58.907
I say, just fucking embrace
that shit.

24:09.647 --> 24:10.987
- Excuse me.
- Yeah?

24:11.015 --> 24:12.985
I'm looking for my son,
Clay Boone.

24:13.017 --> 24:14.257
Marie, let me call you back.

24:14.285 --> 24:18.085
Excuse me. Don't worry about it.

24:18.122 --> 24:20.722
What are you doing here?

24:20.758 --> 24:22.128
I'm his mother, Bill,

24:22.159 --> 24:23.759
and no one could reach you.

24:23.794 --> 24:25.606
'Cause maybe you were too busy
being interrogated

24:25.630 --> 24:27.830
by the police to answer.

24:27.865 --> 24:30.705
I've been getting calls
from my friends all day.

24:30.735 --> 24:33.275
It's embarrassing.
Trafficking drugs, Bill?

24:33.304 --> 24:34.844
Really?

24:34.872 --> 24:36.083
Don't go getting all righteous
with me.

24:36.107 --> 24:37.547
You made your choice.

24:37.575 --> 24:40.015
This is my family.

24:40.044 --> 24:41.544
Bill, please.

24:44.849 --> 24:46.589
Clay could've died in there.

24:47.151 --> 24:49.291
God only knows where Lucas is.

24:49.320 --> 24:50.760
He's not answering his phone.

24:50.788 --> 24:53.588
Lucas is fine.

24:53.624 --> 24:56.524
You tell me that he is not
caught up in all of this.

24:57.962 --> 25:00.002
Ha. When he came to visit me,

25:00.031 --> 25:02.271
he was upset, and he wouldn't
tell me why, but now...

25:02.300 --> 25:04.140
What visit?

25:05.603 --> 25:07.903
You know what?
I don't even care.

25:07.939 --> 25:09.739
Go home, Wendy.

25:10.841 --> 25:13.711
Clay.

25:13.744 --> 25:15.084
Are you okay?

25:15.112 --> 25:16.212
Were you hurt?

25:16.247 --> 25:19.647
Don't.

25:19.684 --> 25:21.061
Look, whatever your mother
told you...

25:21.085 --> 25:22.225
Is what, bullshit?

25:25.790 --> 25:26.960
Where's Lucas?

25:31.295 --> 25:34.635
Did he hurt someone?
Did Lucas hurt someone?

25:34.665 --> 25:36.535
Where'd you hear that?

25:37.868 --> 25:40.538
No, of course not.

25:45.309 --> 25:47.949
Look at me. Look at me.

25:51.115 --> 25:53.155
The men who did this to you
are gone.

25:53.184 --> 25:54.284
They're in jail.

25:54.318 --> 25:56.658
We're gonna start over.

25:56.687 --> 25:58.957
All right?

25:58.990 --> 26:00.830
Right? We won.

26:02.927 --> 26:04.627
We won?

26:04.662 --> 26:07.062
Are you serious?

26:07.098 --> 26:10.268
I almost just fucking died, Pop.

26:10.301 --> 26:11.771
I would never let that happen.

26:11.802 --> 26:12.772
Right, 'cause you're just

26:12.803 --> 26:13.773
so in control of everything.

26:13.804 --> 26:15.274
Look at me.

26:15.306 --> 26:17.746
Look at my legs.

26:17.775 --> 26:19.075
- Clay...
- No, look at them.

26:19.110 --> 26:20.287
I know you hate it, Dad.
I hate it, too.

26:20.311 --> 26:22.051
I told you, the Millers are not

26:22.079 --> 26:23.256
- gonna be trouble anymore.
- The fucking Millers

26:23.280 --> 26:26.350
didn't do this to me.

26:26.384 --> 26:28.854
Henry Coles did.

26:28.886 --> 26:30.856
No, Dad. Hey, she did.

26:30.888 --> 26:32.332
She's been lying to you
about everything.

26:32.356 --> 26:34.656
She found me

26:34.692 --> 26:35.862
in the house.

26:37.728 --> 26:38.968
In the fire.

26:41.165 --> 26:42.705
- She was with you?
- Yeah.

26:43.868 --> 26:45.208
And she did something.

26:46.437 --> 26:47.777
And she grabbed me

26:47.805 --> 26:48.945
and... I don't know.

26:48.973 --> 26:50.143
Everything just fucking

26:50.174 --> 26:51.274
came at us,

26:51.308 --> 26:52.419
and then I saw my wheelchair,

26:52.443 --> 26:53.743
and it crumbled.

26:53.778 --> 26:55.978
Dad, she... she made it happen.

26:56.013 --> 26:57.413
All right? And then, like,

26:57.448 --> 26:59.218
just a second later,
we were in her house.

26:59.250 --> 27:01.150
I don't know how she did it.

27:01.185 --> 27:03.955
I don't know how it happened,
but it fucking happened,

27:03.988 --> 27:05.958
and it wasn't
the first time, either.

27:07.191 --> 27:08.291
Clay...

27:08.325 --> 27:10.065
No, you need to hear this.

27:10.094 --> 27:11.394
I remembered, all right?

27:11.429 --> 27:12.769
I remember what happened

27:12.797 --> 27:14.097
in the truck that day.

27:15.733 --> 27:17.733
Henry crushed me, too.

27:17.768 --> 27:20.068
She crushed me because
she wanted to.

27:20.104 --> 27:21.644
She has some kind of...

27:22.339 --> 27:24.079
God damn it, I don't know.

27:24.108 --> 27:25.978
I don't know, but Henry
did this to me.

27:26.010 --> 27:27.410
Lucas tried to tell you,

27:27.445 --> 27:28.745
and you wouldn't listen.

27:30.114 --> 27:31.414
And he tried to tell me, too.

27:33.884 --> 27:36.424
And it's true.

27:36.454 --> 27:37.954
It's true.

27:40.391 --> 27:41.391
Dad...

27:43.994 --> 27:46.764
Do you believe me?

27:53.137 --> 27:56.007
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna go talk to the doctor

27:56.040 --> 27:57.417
and I'm gonna find out
how long they need

27:57.441 --> 27:59.011
- to keep you in here...
- No.

27:59.043 --> 28:00.783
- I'm gonna stay...
- God damn it.

28:00.811 --> 28:02.322
Clay, I'm gonna get a cot,
and I'm gonna stay...

28:02.346 --> 28:04.416
I'm going home with Mom.

28:04.448 --> 28:05.718
The hell you are.

28:05.750 --> 28:08.290
I can't be in Reston anymore.

28:08.319 --> 28:09.419
What are you talking about?

28:09.453 --> 28:10.823
You're a Boone.

28:10.855 --> 28:11.985
I built a future

28:12.022 --> 28:13.992
for you and your brother here.

28:14.024 --> 28:15.094
This is our home.

28:15.126 --> 28:16.326
We don't have a home!

28:16.360 --> 28:17.360
Where is our home?

28:19.363 --> 28:21.363
Your mother doesn't know
how to take care of you.

28:21.398 --> 28:23.068
Well, she'll figure it out.

28:25.202 --> 28:27.702
And at least with her,
I'll be safe.

28:44.555 --> 28:45.825
Hey.

28:48.526 --> 28:51.326
You were the one who hurt Clay?

28:51.362 --> 28:53.302
Not that drunk driver?

28:55.466 --> 28:56.966
It doesn't make you a villain,

28:57.001 --> 28:59.341
if that's what you're thinking.

28:59.370 --> 29:00.840
Your body responds to fear.

29:00.871 --> 29:02.341
I know that.

29:04.809 --> 29:07.079
Which means
he must have hurt you first?

29:15.219 --> 29:18.959
My mom told me that if you feel
like hugging or kissing someone,

29:18.989 --> 29:20.989
you have to ask for permission,

29:21.025 --> 29:22.795
because... because

29:22.827 --> 29:24.127
people have boundaries.

29:24.161 --> 29:26.501
It's a rule. You just...

29:26.530 --> 29:28.970
You j... you just have to.

29:34.839 --> 29:36.579
Thanks, Townes.

29:42.613 --> 29:44.013
My God.

29:44.048 --> 29:45.318
So good.

29:45.349 --> 29:47.049
How much did you smoke?

29:53.290 --> 29:56.060
Hey, you can sit here
if you want.

29:56.093 --> 29:59.063
What?

29:59.096 --> 30:02.936
You're sweet, but I think
I'm gonna go over there.

30:02.967 --> 30:04.544
That's cool.
You want me to come with you?

30:04.568 --> 30:05.908
Nah.

30:05.936 --> 30:07.976
So, how did you know it'd work,

30:08.005 --> 30:09.275
bringing Clay with you?

30:09.306 --> 30:12.006
I don't think I did.

30:12.042 --> 30:15.512
I mean, it felt different.

30:15.546 --> 30:16.846
Like, it felt like I...

30:16.881 --> 30:20.251
I willed myself to do it.

30:20.284 --> 30:22.024
Does that sound crazy?

30:26.290 --> 30:27.560
What are you doing?

30:27.591 --> 30:29.231
What are you doing?

30:29.260 --> 30:30.300
Tater tots!

30:32.396 --> 30:34.466
The idea of you evolving
is interesting.

30:34.498 --> 30:37.398
Like your prior seizures
were a side effect

30:37.434 --> 30:38.474
of this metamorphosis,

30:38.502 --> 30:40.072
and your extended seizure

30:40.104 --> 30:42.644
was your chrysalis stage.

30:42.673 --> 30:44.573
What if this is your final form?

30:44.608 --> 30:46.508
Like how Pikachu
evolves into Raichu.

30:46.543 --> 30:47.513
My God,

30:47.544 --> 30:50.014
I love Pikachu.

30:50.047 --> 30:52.887
I don't feel like my final form.

30:52.917 --> 30:56.217
Well, maybe it's just
the beginning.

30:56.253 --> 30:58.923
We should train you.

30:58.956 --> 31:00.556
What do you mean, train me?

31:00.591 --> 31:03.631
Like what?
Like karate or something?

31:03.661 --> 31:06.131
Among other things.

31:06.163 --> 31:08.403
Henry, we don't know
what's next for you,

31:08.432 --> 31:12.072
but... it's always better
to be prepared.

31:12.102 --> 31:13.572
Townes is right,

31:13.604 --> 31:15.274
and no matter what happens,

31:15.306 --> 31:16.606
we'll be here to help.

31:42.032 --> 31:43.272
Bill.

31:43.300 --> 31:45.670
Hey.

31:45.703 --> 31:47.203
It's really not a good time.

31:49.006 --> 31:50.676
Why, you got company
or something?

31:53.110 --> 31:55.350
Look, Iris, I've had
hell of a day.

31:55.379 --> 31:57.649
I just need a place to crash.

31:57.681 --> 32:00.181
I'll make dinner. You got pasta?

32:00.217 --> 32:02.057
I don't think
that's a good idea.

32:03.587 --> 32:05.587
I-I'll sleep on your couch.

32:11.195 --> 32:12.665
Here.

32:12.696 --> 32:13.996
For a hotel.

32:14.031 --> 32:15.331
Just for a night or two.

32:32.449 --> 32:33.589
Killing it.

32:33.617 --> 32:36.557
The four-pin dance.

32:36.587 --> 32:38.027
These... These are

32:38.055 --> 32:41.325
the most hipster-y
ones I think we have.

32:41.358 --> 32:44.528
Do you think I'm a hipster?

32:44.561 --> 32:46.201
That's not a cool thing anymore?

32:47.264 --> 32:49.704
My God!

32:49.733 --> 32:53.503
You scared me, you know.

32:53.537 --> 32:56.177
I was afraid that we'd lose you.

32:56.206 --> 32:58.576
Now, if that happened,

32:58.609 --> 32:59.979
I don't know what I'd do.

33:07.484 --> 33:08.724
- You got this.
- Here we go.

33:08.752 --> 33:10.492
- You have got this.
- Got this.

34:02.606 --> 34:04.246
Yes! Whoo-hoo!

34:05.709 --> 34:07.549
Focus on your breathing.

34:07.578 --> 34:09.547
Arms straight out from you.
My God.

34:16.487 --> 34:17.757
Okay, yes.

34:39.643 --> 34:42.382
Two strikes is my record,
and we got Henry

34:42.411 --> 34:43.681
to play a sport!

34:43.714 --> 34:45.254
Bowling is not a sport.

34:45.282 --> 34:47.152
Don't say that.
That's like saying "Macbeth"

34:47.184 --> 34:48.754
in a theater. It's bad luck.

34:48.784 --> 34:50.425
I don't think
that that's a thing.

34:50.454 --> 34:52.824
All right,
come on, people, eat up.

34:52.856 --> 34:54.525
- My God.
- I still have...

34:54.558 --> 34:56.398
I don't know. I swear to God,

34:56.426 --> 34:58.226
five industrial-sized tins

34:58.262 --> 34:59.873
of what I can only guess
is cheese in the back.

34:59.897 --> 35:01.667
We're gonna be eating nachos
for a month.

35:01.698 --> 35:05.138
Don't say that like
it's a bad thing, young lady.

35:05.169 --> 35:07.369
Hey, do you think you'll ever
open up another business?

35:07.404 --> 35:10.304
I don't know. We'll have to see.

35:10.340 --> 35:12.880
I do know that I'm gonna
miss this place, though.

35:12.910 --> 35:14.780
Remember the day
you and your mom walked in?

35:14.811 --> 35:16.211
Asked if anybody knew

35:16.246 --> 35:17.616
to fix a...

35:17.648 --> 35:18.818
A transmission?

35:18.849 --> 35:20.489
Well, this place

35:20.517 --> 35:22.457
has been good to me.

35:22.486 --> 35:25.526
You still can't fix
a transmission.

35:28.292 --> 35:30.203
- It's true, though.
- I know, it's totally true.

35:30.227 --> 35:31.827
I don't know who can, though.

35:34.898 --> 35:38.298
This might be the worst thing
that's ever happened to me.

35:39.670 --> 35:40.680
- My God.
- Says the super pro.

35:40.704 --> 35:42.244
Wow.

35:44.775 --> 35:46.515
Mom.

35:46.543 --> 35:47.913
Yeah?

35:50.747 --> 35:52.647
I think we should stay.

35:55.919 --> 35:58.359
Yeah?

35:58.388 --> 35:59.358
Yeah.

35:59.389 --> 36:00.729
I mean, they're like

36:00.757 --> 36:01.901
the closest thing
that we've ever had

36:01.925 --> 36:04.595
to something

36:04.628 --> 36:06.268
normal-ish.

36:08.432 --> 36:10.532
I mean, they're pretty weird,
but still,

36:10.567 --> 36:12.337
mostly in a good way.

36:15.672 --> 36:19.542
I don't think that it has to be
just me and you anymore.

36:21.411 --> 36:22.411
Come here.

37:01.351 --> 37:03.721
Townes, do you know
how early it is?

37:03.754 --> 37:05.954
You need to come over
right away.

37:05.989 --> 37:07.689
No, I'm in bed.

37:07.724 --> 37:11.594
This is important.
It's about Henry.

37:11.628 --> 37:12.998
Fine, I'll wake her up, but...

37:13.030 --> 37:14.800
No, Henry can't know about this.

37:14.831 --> 37:16.831
Come now. Come alone.

38:21.098 --> 38:22.098
Mrs. Miller.

38:22.132 --> 38:23.802
I'm sorry to disturb you.

38:23.834 --> 38:24.964
If this is regarding

38:25.001 --> 38:26.471
my husband's arrest, I don't...

38:26.503 --> 38:27.503
It's not.

38:27.537 --> 38:28.507
I wanted to

38:28.538 --> 38:31.378
tell you in person.

38:31.408 --> 38:34.808
We have a lead suspect
in Amos' case.

38:34.845 --> 38:36.415
It's Lucas Boone.

38:39.649 --> 38:41.819
I see.

38:41.852 --> 38:44.052
And you... you can now
make an arrest?

38:44.087 --> 38:45.427
I will, yes.

38:45.455 --> 38:46.795
Soon.

39:03.507 --> 39:06.677
There are many different ways
to make peace

39:06.710 --> 39:09.880
with tragedy,
aren't there, Deputy?

39:11.915 --> 39:14.455
There was a fire

39:14.484 --> 39:16.124
at Bill Boone's house
last night.

39:18.655 --> 39:21.055
You happen to know
anything about that?

39:23.126 --> 39:24.826
No, I'm afraid not.

39:28.098 --> 39:30.898
Well, luckily, nobody was hurt.

39:30.934 --> 39:33.134
My goodness.

39:33.170 --> 39:35.770
What providence.

39:45.949 --> 39:48.419
I really hope you find
some comfort, Mrs. Miller.

39:53.890 --> 39:55.990
Have a nice day.

39:56.026 --> 39:58.626
Thank you.

39:58.662 --> 40:00.632
You as well.

40:42.205 --> 40:44.675
- Somebody grab him!
- What was that?

40:44.708 --> 40:47.648
Townes, I've seen that clip,
like, a dozen times.

40:47.677 --> 40:49.977
Yes, but now I know who this is.

40:51.147 --> 40:52.917
- How?
- I've been searching

40:52.949 --> 40:56.689
missing persons reports
from tropical locations.

40:56.720 --> 40:58.920
Same age, race.

40:58.955 --> 41:00.495
His name's Michael Pearce,

41:00.524 --> 41:01.901
and he was reported missing
in Bermuda

41:01.925 --> 41:04.765
two days into his vacation.

41:04.794 --> 41:05.934
It does look like him.

41:05.962 --> 41:07.832
He's dead.

41:07.864 --> 41:09.575
His body washed up
off the coast of Newfoundland,

41:09.599 --> 41:11.939
still wearing
this Hawaiian shirt.

41:11.968 --> 41:15.238
Do you think this is the same
teleporter who was at your house?

41:18.542 --> 41:19.572
I don't know. I mean,

41:19.609 --> 41:20.609
Henry said the guy

41:20.644 --> 41:21.814
who broke into our house

41:21.845 --> 41:23.685
took her dad a long time ago.

41:23.713 --> 41:25.283
This guy looks younger.

41:25.315 --> 41:27.085
But what does this mean?

41:27.117 --> 41:29.857
That... that teleporters
are taking people?

41:29.886 --> 41:31.686
Not just any people.

41:31.721 --> 41:33.191
Michael Pearce was a geneticist.

41:33.223 --> 41:35.023
He worked at Clear Tech.

41:35.058 --> 41:37.758
The company that makes
solar panels and electric cars?

41:37.794 --> 41:39.734
Why would a geneticist
work for them?

41:39.763 --> 41:40.763
Well...

41:43.199 --> 41:44.769
Hold up.

41:46.570 --> 41:48.570
What's going on?

41:53.777 --> 41:56.147
I think I've been hacked.

42:38.221 --> 42:40.261
Henrietta, it's Bill Boone.

42:40.290 --> 42:42.890
I'm at your house,
having a chat with your mom.

42:42.926 --> 42:44.026
You should join us.

42:44.060 --> 42:45.300
No, Henry, don't!

42:53.336 --> 42:55.076
Mom.

42:55.105 --> 42:56.875
What's going on? Are you okay?

42:56.906 --> 42:59.106
Henry...

43:01.411 --> 43:04.211
Help me understand, Henrietta.

43:07.183 --> 43:10.953
Lucas tried to tell me,
but, you know, he's...

43:10.987 --> 43:14.027
well...

43:14.057 --> 43:15.627
And Clay...

43:19.663 --> 43:22.633
You should've seen
the expression on his face.

43:23.967 --> 43:25.337
He's afraid of you.

43:25.368 --> 43:26.908
My boy,

43:26.936 --> 43:29.176
who is scared of nothing,

43:29.205 --> 43:31.305
is afraid of a little girl.

43:31.341 --> 43:33.019
Bill, I don't know what you
think that Henry can do.

43:33.043 --> 43:34.043
This is crazy.

43:39.849 --> 43:41.049
I'm not leaving here

43:41.084 --> 43:42.754
until you show me your trick.

43:45.822 --> 43:48.262
Doesn't work like that.
I can't just...

43:49.793 --> 43:51.763
I can't just make it happen.

43:54.864 --> 43:56.204
- Okay, Mom, Mom...
- It's okay.

43:58.735 --> 44:00.735
You made me believe that you...

44:02.172 --> 44:03.912
That you cared about my son.

44:06.009 --> 44:08.849
What was I supposed to do?

44:08.878 --> 44:11.148
I trusted you,
and you lied to me.

44:11.181 --> 44:13.321
- You're fucking insane.
- Henry, stop it.

44:13.349 --> 44:16.119
You took my family away from me.

44:16.152 --> 44:18.092
No, I didn't.

44:18.121 --> 44:19.291
I didn't.

44:20.924 --> 44:23.394
You have five seconds
to show me.

44:23.426 --> 44:25.266
I can't.

44:25.295 --> 44:27.995
- Okay?
- Admit what you did to my son.

44:28.031 --> 44:29.901
Please, just put the gun down.

44:29.933 --> 44:33.003
- Four.
- Just leave my mom out of it!

44:33.036 --> 44:34.176
- Three.
- Okay, okay, okay!

44:34.204 --> 44:35.904
I did it! I did it! I did it!

44:35.939 --> 44:38.709
I hurt Clay in his truck.

44:38.742 --> 44:41.312
I did it, and I didn't mean to,
and I'm sorry.

44:41.344 --> 44:43.384
- Show me!
- I don't know how!

44:43.413 --> 44:44.413
No, please, let me go!

44:57.794 --> 44:59.234
Mom.

45:09.005 --> 45:10.405
Fuck, fuck.

45:33.496 --> 45:35.036
No.

45:51.414 --> 45:52.884
Dad?

46:24.380 --> 46:26.220
Where are we? Do you...

48:18.962 --> 48:20.002
Mom!

48:22.265 --> 48:23.535
Mom?

48:25.134 --> 48:26.334
Mom!

48:39.415 --> 48:42.215
Mom...

50:08.137 --> 50:10.237
Quite a mess you left me here.

50:14.710 --> 50:16.750
I bet you got
a lot of questions.
