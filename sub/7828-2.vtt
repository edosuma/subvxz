00:37.926 --> 00:39.836
Lisa, will you keep it down?

00:40.120 --> 00:42.337
I'm making a crank call
to Principal Skinner.

00:42.556 --> 00:45.470
As a matter of fact,
my refrigerator wasn't running.

00:45.225 --> 00:48.760
You spared me quite a bit of spoilage.
Thank you, anonymous young man.

00:48.979 --> 00:50.771
It's my room and I can
do what I want.

00:50.981 --> 00:54.931
Oh, yeah? Well, I can do
what I want in my room.

00:58.155 --> 00:59.530
Bart, quit it!

01:01.750 --> 01:02.735
I can keep this up all day.

01:12.920 --> 01:16.123
Lisa, stop the racket. I'm trying
to fix your mother's camera.

01:16.298 --> 01:20.343
Easy. Easy.

01:21.512 --> 01:23.551
I'm gonna need a bigger drill.

01:32.773 --> 01:36.308
My, these seas are certainly heaving.

01:36.485 --> 01:40.317
Well, no more than your
bountiful bosom, my lady.

01:42.449 --> 01:44.525
Does that earring
mean you're a pirate?

01:44.743 --> 01:46.202
Kind of.

01:46.370 --> 01:48.446
The seas have quieted.

01:48.622 --> 01:54.826
And only in the sweet embrace
of quietude can two lovers truly be as...

01:55.400 --> 01:58.455
Such noise! Well, I'm done
for the evening.

02:00.759 --> 02:05.670
Lisa, stop blowing my sex. I mean, stop
blowing your sax. Your sax. Stop it.

02:05.889 --> 02:08.640
Mom, I'm auditioning for first chair
in the school band...

02:08.809 --> 02:10.268
...and I've got to practice.

02:10.477 --> 02:13.150
I'm sorry, but I sacrificed
a very expensive camera...

02:13.188 --> 02:15.150
...just to get some quiet time.

02:18.777 --> 02:21.190
Fine, I'll play outside.

02:23.282 --> 02:25.689
Hey! Why, that sounds
like Gabriel's trumpet.

02:25.868 --> 02:27.410
You know what that means, kids.

02:28.495 --> 02:30.369
Judgment Day!

02:31.915 --> 02:34.204
Forty-five seconds till pencils down.

02:34.626 --> 02:37.200
Lisa, what's the answer
to number seven?

02:37.379 --> 02:40.840
Sorry, Ralph. That would defeat
the purpose of testing...

02:40.257 --> 02:42.463
...as a means of student evaluation.

02:42.634 --> 02:44.461
My cat's name is Mittens.

02:44.678 --> 02:47.596
Three. Two. One.
And that's pencils down.

02:49.391 --> 02:51.847
Now, here's an oral
extra-credit question.

02:52.190 --> 02:54.510
What was Christopher Columbus
actually looking for...

02:54.688 --> 02:57.600
...when he discovered America?

02:57.608 --> 02:59.766
Anyone besides Lisa for a change?

03:01.700 --> 03:04.403
Ralph, this better not be
about your cat.

03:04.740 --> 03:07.527
- Oh, all right.
- He was looking for a passage to India.

03:08.202 --> 03:11.653
Correct, Allison. And on your
very first day in our class.

03:11.872 --> 03:14.197
And during a subsequent voyage,
Columbus found...

03:14.375 --> 03:16.350
...the continent of South America.

03:17.586 --> 03:19.875
I never made Miss Hoover "yow-wee."

03:22.174 --> 03:24.100
Hi, Allison. I'm Lisa Simpson.

03:24.218 --> 03:26.625
It's great to finally meet someone
who converses...

03:26.804 --> 03:28.880
...above the normal 8-year-old level.

03:29.980 --> 03:30.426
Actually, I'm 7.

03:30.599 --> 03:33.719
I was skipped ahead because
I was bored in the first grade.

03:33.936 --> 03:35.430
You're younger than me too?

03:40.609 --> 03:45.271
- Are you hyperventilating?
- No. I just like to smell my lunch.

03:45.447 --> 03:47.819
I never met anyone
who skipped a grade before.

03:47.992 --> 03:50.827
I'm surprised you haven't.
You're obviously smart enough.

03:51.360 --> 03:53.492
Well, I'm sure I could have.

03:53.664 --> 03:56.748
But I'd hate to leave behind
all my wonderful friends.

03:56.959 --> 03:59.829
Out of the way, brain queen!

04:00.400 --> 04:01.996
Hey, Sara.

04:02.172 --> 04:05.956
Well, I gotta go. I have to practice
for band auditions.

04:06.135 --> 04:08.800
Me too. What instrument do you play?

04:08.178 --> 04:09.922
- The sax.
- Me too.

04:10.970 --> 04:12.469
- I'm going for first chair this year.
- Me too.

04:12.641 --> 04:16.425
Wow! We have so much in common.
I'm sure we'll be the best of friends.

04:16.603 --> 04:19.177
- Me too.
- Me too.

04:22.568 --> 04:23.896
Hurry up and finish eating.

04:24.690 --> 04:25.861
You're steering fine, boy.

04:26.300 --> 04:29.862
Hard to the right. Hard to the left.
Cat! Deer! Old man!

04:31.410 --> 04:33.153
Jackknifed sugar truck!

04:33.329 --> 04:34.657
Sugar?

04:38.500 --> 04:39.959
Don't worry. Here's a quarter.

04:40.127 --> 04:42.499
Call for help. I'll keep an eye
on things here.

04:42.671 --> 04:46.455
If only the sugar were
as sweet as you, sir.

04:46.634 --> 04:48.341
That was downright decent of you.

04:48.510 --> 04:50.337
We hit the jackpot here!

04:50.512 --> 04:53.798
White gold! Texas tea!

04:53.974 --> 04:55.552
Sweetener.

04:58.187 --> 04:59.681
Dad, isn't this stealing?

04:59.855 --> 05:03.639
Read your town charter, boy.
If foodstuff should touch the ground...

05:03.817 --> 05:06.771
...said foodstuff shall be turned over
to the village idiot.

05:06.945 --> 05:09.483
Since I don't see him around,
start shoveling!

05:14.953 --> 05:16.697
- Mom?
- What? What?

05:16.914 --> 05:20.614
Why am I rotting away in the second
grade instead of being skipped ahead?

05:20.834 --> 05:23.954
I don't know. I guess that's
the school's decision to make.

05:24.171 --> 05:27.421
Did you talk to anyone at school?
Make a few calls on my behalf?

05:27.633 --> 05:31.132
You could've been nicer to Principal
Skinner, if you know what I mean.

05:31.345 --> 05:34.262
Lisa! I am nice.

05:36.580 --> 05:40.186
Homer, I appreciate you making dinner,
but this food tastes a little strange.

05:40.354 --> 05:41.729
It hurts my teeth.

05:41.939 --> 05:44.346
That's because I've loaded it
with sugar!

05:45.818 --> 05:47.810
Marge, our ship has come in.

05:47.987 --> 05:50.691
I found 500 pounds of sugar
in the forest...

05:50.864 --> 05:53.153
...that I'm gonna sell directly
to the consumer.

05:53.325 --> 05:56.112
And all for a low, low price
of one dollar per pound.

05:56.328 --> 05:58.700
But the store sells sugar
for 35 cents a pound.

05:58.872 --> 06:01.198
And it doesn't have nails
and broken glass in it.

06:01.375 --> 06:03.831
Those are prizes.

06:05.671 --> 06:07.130
A blasting cap.

06:12.110 --> 06:13.421
It's your turn, Jimbo.

06:16.598 --> 06:19.516
Someone's been practicing
over the summer. Welcome aboard.

06:19.727 --> 06:21.636
Yes!

06:22.104 --> 06:23.432
My lute!

06:24.273 --> 06:27.856
Lisa Simpson trying
for first-chair saxophone.

06:35.451 --> 06:39.662
Very nice. Now Allison Taylor,
also trying for first-chair saxophone.

06:49.840 --> 06:52.711
This is a very tough decision, girls.
You're both very good.

07:03.270 --> 07:05.140
Well, I guess that clinches it.

07:32.966 --> 07:35.458
That was a close one, Lisa,
but you made it.

07:35.636 --> 07:37.110
I won first chair?

07:37.179 --> 07:39.848
No, you regained consciousness.
Allison got first chair.

07:46.563 --> 07:49.351
Oh, it was just a dream.

07:49.525 --> 07:51.932
That was a close one, Lisa,
but you made it.

07:52.111 --> 07:53.605
I won first chair?

07:53.779 --> 07:56.484
No, you regained consciousness.
Allison got first chair.

07:56.699 --> 07:58.738
And believe me, this is not a dream!

08:05.749 --> 08:07.908
I need help. There's another girl
at school...

08:08.850 --> 08:10.837
...who's smarter, younger
and a better sax player than me.

08:11.500 --> 08:15.251
- I feel so average.
- You'll always be number one to me.

08:15.426 --> 08:18.795
Hello! First born within earshot.

08:19.130 --> 08:21.468
I meant my number one girl.

08:22.725 --> 08:24.931
Oh, for crying...

08:25.144 --> 08:28.678
Honey, if you get too competitive,
you'll never be happy.

08:28.897 --> 08:31.649
No matter how good you are,
there's always someone better.

08:31.817 --> 08:36.727
I thought I had the tallest hair, but that
trip to Graceland really opened my eyes.

08:36.947 --> 08:39.865
But she's better than me at
everything that makes me special.

08:40.750 --> 08:43.409
Believe me, honey. She's more scared
of you than you are of her.

08:43.578 --> 08:46.117
You're thinking of bears, Mom.

08:47.833 --> 08:50.122
Sugarman!

08:51.712 --> 08:54.582
Door to door sugar?
What a marvelous idea.

08:54.757 --> 08:57.248
- Who's at the door?
- What's that, Mother?

08:57.426 --> 08:59.999
I'm just talking to the sugarman!

09:00.179 --> 09:03.490
Mother, I'm a big boy.
I can do as I wish.

09:03.223 --> 09:05.133
Excuse me.

09:05.976 --> 09:07.933
Thanks a lot, Simpson,
now I'm grounded.

09:09.813 --> 09:12.102
Hey, Allison, what's the answer
to number nine?

09:12.274 --> 09:15.975
- I can't tell you, Ralph.
- I can't tell you either, Ralph.

09:16.153 --> 09:18.110
Leave me alone.

09:18.322 --> 09:19.946
- Brainiac!
- Nerd!

09:20.115 --> 09:21.491
You're such a geekazoid!

09:21.659 --> 09:23.532
Leave me alone.

09:25.996 --> 09:28.321
That used to be my face in the mud.

09:28.499 --> 09:31.416
I can't stand to see you
so miserable, Lis.

09:31.585 --> 09:33.792
Unless it's from a rubber
spider down your dress.

09:34.400 --> 09:35.546
That gives me an idea.

09:35.714 --> 09:40.920
Note for later: Put rubber spider
down Lisa's dress.

09:48.644 --> 09:51.313
Hey, I know! How about if I dig up
some dirt on Allison?

09:51.480 --> 09:54.267
Remember how I got Milhouse
on America 's Most Wanted?

09:56.151 --> 09:58.856
- There he is on the monkey bars.
- Try to take him alive.

10:00.114 --> 10:01.656
Oh, no! Not again!

10:04.535 --> 10:08.340
I appreciate the offer, but it goes against
every moral fiber in my body.

10:08.205 --> 10:10.874
Suit yourself. If you change your mind,
here's my card.

10:11.410 --> 10:13.248
Don't need it.
You live in the room next to me.

10:13.419 --> 10:16.455
Note: Next year, order fewer cards.

10:16.672 --> 10:18.546
And you didn't think
I'd make any money.

10:18.757 --> 10:21.509
I found a dollar while I was
waiting for the bus.

10:21.719 --> 10:23.711
While you were out "earning"
that dollar...

10:23.887 --> 10:26.425
...you lost 40 dollars
by not going to work.

10:26.640 --> 10:30.560
The plant said if you don't come
tomorrow, don't bother coming Monday.

10:30.561 --> 10:31.972
Four-day weekend!

10:38.527 --> 10:40.105
Hey, I am above average.

10:40.279 --> 10:44.941
So what if Allison's ahead of me?
There's no shame in being second.

10:45.117 --> 10:47.904
And now Avis Rent A Car
is proud to present...

10:48.780 --> 10:50.830
...the second-best band in America.

10:51.400 --> 10:54.409
We welcome Garfunkel, Messina,
Oates and Lisa...

10:54.626 --> 10:58.755
...singing their number two hit,
"Born to Runner-Up."

11:04.803 --> 11:06.926
Why would they come
to our concert to boo us?

11:07.970 --> 11:09.173
Lis, I did some checking
on this Allison.

11:09.350 --> 11:11.722
And I know it's against
all your moral fibers...

11:11.894 --> 11:13.554
Give it to me!

11:13.729 --> 11:16.180
Hey, wait. There's nothing bad here.

11:16.231 --> 11:18.271
Yep. She's clean as a bean.

11:18.442 --> 11:20.185
But I did tip off the feds...

11:20.361 --> 11:24.260
...as to the whereabouts
of our good friend Milhouse.

11:24.448 --> 11:27.698
- But I'm telling you, I didn't do anything.
- I don't care.

11:35.751 --> 11:37.542
My glasses!

11:40.631 --> 11:42.956
I've got to stop being so petty.

11:43.175 --> 11:45.666
I should be Allison's friend,
not her competitor.

11:45.844 --> 11:50.802
I mean, she is a wonderful person.

11:51.160 --> 11:53.803
Way to go, Lis. I mean,
why compete with someone...

11:53.977 --> 11:56.184
...who's just gonna kick
your butt anyway.

11:56.355 --> 11:58.182
I prefer my phrasing.

12:00.734 --> 12:03.819
It's great of you to come over.
I really want us to be friends.

12:03.988 --> 12:06.640
You're a wonderful person.

12:06.281 --> 12:08.819
Hi, Lisa. I'm Allison's father,
Professor Taylor.

12:08.992 --> 12:12.326
- I've heard great things about you.
- Oh, really? I...

12:12.538 --> 12:15.741
I'm glad we have someone who can
join us in our anagram games.

12:15.916 --> 12:20.800
We take names and rearrange the letters
to form a description of that person.

12:20.296 --> 12:23.296
Well, like, oh, I don't know...
Alec Guinness.

12:24.591 --> 12:27.343
- Genuine class.
- Very good.

12:27.511 --> 12:29.468
All right, Lisa.

12:30.431 --> 12:32.423
Jeremy Irons.

12:34.685 --> 12:36.891
Jeremy's Iron.

12:38.647 --> 12:43.393
Well, that's very good for a first try.

12:43.569 --> 12:46.320
You know, I have a ball.

12:46.530 --> 12:48.523
Perhaps you'd like to bounce it.

12:56.123 --> 12:59.207
- What's this?
- It's for the school diorama competition.

12:59.418 --> 13:02.454
You're finished already?
But the competition isn't for weeks!

13:02.921 --> 13:05.459
Lisa, we're talking dioramas.
Who could wait?

13:05.633 --> 13:08.206
I chose "The Tell-Tale Heart"
by Edgar Allan Poe.

13:08.427 --> 13:11.511
See, this is the bedroom
where the old man was murdered.

13:11.680 --> 13:14.634
And he's buried here
under the floorboards.

13:14.808 --> 13:18.120
And, look, I used an old metronome
to simulate the heartbeat...

13:18.187 --> 13:21.437
...that drove the killer insane.

13:23.609 --> 13:25.732
Neat, huh?

13:26.280 --> 13:29.278
It's great. It's really great.

13:34.870 --> 13:38.204
Got away from you, huh?
Well, you keep at it.

13:49.218 --> 13:52.503
Must protect sugar.

13:52.680 --> 13:57.341
Thieves everywhere.
The strong must protect the sweet.

13:57.518 --> 13:59.806
The sweet.

14:01.313 --> 14:04.100
- Homer?
- In America...

14:04.274 --> 14:06.766
...first you get the sugar...

14:06.944 --> 14:09.150
...then you get the power...

14:09.321 --> 14:12.156
...then you get the women.

14:12.574 --> 14:13.903
Homer.

14:14.760 --> 14:15.701
- Homer!
- What?

14:15.911 --> 14:18.690
Forget about guarding
the stupid sugar.

14:18.247 --> 14:20.156
You're being completely paranoid.

14:20.332 --> 14:23.831
Oh, am I? Am I really?

14:24.378 --> 14:26.860
Hello.

14:26.255 --> 14:28.461
Where'd you get your
sugar for that tea?

14:28.674 --> 14:32.374
I nipped it when you let your
guard down for that split second.

14:32.553 --> 14:34.592
And I'd do it again.

14:35.222 --> 14:37.843
- Goodbye.
- You see, Marge? You see?

14:38.170 --> 14:40.638
When are you gonna give up
this crazy sugar scheme?

14:40.853 --> 14:43.590
Never! Never, Marge.

14:43.230 --> 14:45.899
I can't live the button-down life
like you.

14:46.660 --> 14:49.566
I want it all. The terrifying lows,
the dizzying highs...

14:49.737 --> 14:51.231
...the creamy middles.

14:51.405 --> 14:54.525
Sure, I might offend a few
of the blue noses...

14:54.700 --> 14:57.720
...with my cocky stride
and musky odors.

14:57.244 --> 15:01.456
Oh, I'll never be the darling
of the so-called city fathers...

15:01.623 --> 15:04.245
...who cluck their tongues,
stroke their beards...

15:04.418 --> 15:08.167
...and talk about, "What's to be done
with this Homer Simpson?"

15:08.380 --> 15:11.132
Look. Just get rid of the sugar, okay?

15:11.342 --> 15:12.717
No!

15:18.766 --> 15:22.598
Hey, get off my sugar! Bad bees! Bad!

15:24.980 --> 15:27.602
Oh, they're defending
themselves somehow.

15:28.901 --> 15:31.439
Look, Bart. It almost killed me...

15:31.654 --> 15:35.438
...but I handcrafted all 75 characters
from Oliver Twist.

15:35.658 --> 15:38.300
And now the coup de grâce:

15:38.202 --> 15:41.653
A bitter snowstorm.

15:47.670 --> 15:50.374
- Is it okay?
- Well...

15:50.589 --> 15:53.460
The important thing
is that we survived.

15:54.426 --> 15:58.341
Who am I kidding? There's no way
I'm ever gonna beat Allison!

15:58.514 --> 16:00.553
Sure there is.

16:00.724 --> 16:06.394
But it involves being a bit underhanded.
A bit devious, a bit...

16:06.563 --> 16:09.399
...as the French say, "Bart-esque."

16:09.608 --> 16:11.670
I'll do whatever it takes.

16:11.235 --> 16:14.686
Then welcome to the nether regions
of the soul.

16:17.282 --> 16:19.740
Now, here's what we do.

16:19.284 --> 16:21.277
Tomorrow, when Allison comes out...

16:21.453 --> 16:25.747
...we spray her with the hose,
soaking her from head to toe.

16:25.916 --> 16:27.909
- Leaving us relatively dry.
- Relatively?

16:28.850 --> 16:29.959
There's bound to be some splashback.

16:30.170 --> 16:33.456
Bart, her being wet won't help me
win the competition!

16:33.674 --> 16:35.713
Well, we could just sabotage
her diorama...

16:35.884 --> 16:38.554
...humiliating her in front of
the students and faculty.

16:38.762 --> 16:40.305
- Perfect!
- Leaving her primed...

16:40.472 --> 16:43.307
...for the most dramatic
hose-soaking of her life!

16:43.517 --> 16:45.308
Enough with the hose!

16:47.688 --> 16:50.309
Well, sure is quiet in here today.

16:50.482 --> 16:53.982
Yes, a little too quiet
if you know what I mean.

16:54.653 --> 16:56.147
- I'm afraid I don't.
- You see...

16:56.321 --> 17:00.106
...bees usually make
a lot of noise. No noise...

17:00.284 --> 17:02.750
...suggests no bees.

17:02.578 --> 17:05.579
I understand now.
Oh, look. There goes one.

17:05.748 --> 17:08.320
- To the Beemobile!
- You mean your Chevy?

17:08.500 --> 17:09.911
Yes.

17:10.711 --> 17:12.390
Very clever, Simpson.

17:12.212 --> 17:13.755
Luring our bees to your sugar...

17:13.922 --> 17:16.248
...and selling them back
at an inflated price.

17:16.467 --> 17:20.381
- Bees are on the what, now?
- Simpson, you diabolical...

17:20.596 --> 17:23.964
We're willing to pay you $2000
for the swarm.

17:24.183 --> 17:25.594
Deal!

17:27.560 --> 17:30.134
Oh, wait a minute.
The bees are leaving.

17:31.398 --> 17:35.396
No! My sugar is melting!

17:35.569 --> 17:38.190
Melting! Oh, what a world!

17:43.661 --> 17:45.203
I'm sorry, Homie.

17:45.370 --> 17:48.407
It's okay, Marge.
I've learned my lesson.

17:48.582 --> 17:51.868
A mountain of sugar
is too much for one man.

17:52.860 --> 17:55.918
It's clear now why God portions it out
in those tiny packets...

17:56.900 --> 17:59.423
...and why he lives
on a plantation in Hawaii.

18:01.530 --> 18:05.549
Diorama-Rama. My favorite school event
next to Hearing Test Thursday.

18:05.766 --> 18:07.889
"The Grapes of Wrath"? I don't get it.

18:08.600 --> 18:12.188
Here's the grapes,
and here's the wrath!

18:14.483 --> 18:16.523
Yes, yes. Very good wrath.

18:16.693 --> 18:20.276
Let's see. Our foreign exchange
student, Uter, has chosen...

18:20.447 --> 18:22.736
...Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.

18:22.908 --> 18:24.236
I...

18:24.410 --> 18:26.153
But this is just an empty box.

18:26.912 --> 18:30.826
I begged you to look at mine first.
I begged you!

18:32.840 --> 18:36.461
Lisa, here is, as the French say,
"Le fake diorama."

18:36.630 --> 18:39.833
I'll create a diversion
and you make the switch.

18:40.342 --> 18:43.427
Hey, everybody! Whoa!
Look at me! I'm over here!

18:43.595 --> 18:45.635
Turn this way right now!

18:45.848 --> 18:49.383
- Hey, it's Bart!
- And he's doing stuff!

18:50.102 --> 18:53.637
- Oh, I can't take my eyes off him.
- Look what he's doing.

18:54.982 --> 18:58.180
Bart, stop creating a diversion
and get out of here!

19:02.156 --> 19:06.568
Our next entry is "The Tell-Tale Heart"
from Allison Taylor.

19:06.744 --> 19:08.866
I can't wait. Be ready with the ribbon.

19:12.499 --> 19:15.500
- What is it?
- It's a cow's heart.

19:15.669 --> 19:18.623
Them trying to make a monkey
out of you.

19:19.923 --> 19:22.461
Allison, is this supposed to be
some kind of joke?

19:23.719 --> 19:25.593
I didn't do that.

19:25.763 --> 19:27.910
I made a different one.

19:27.306 --> 19:30.805
Oh, is that so, young lady?
Well, where is this phantom diorama?

19:32.227 --> 19:33.722
I don't know.

19:40.277 --> 19:42.104
Have the guts to take the blame, girl.

19:42.279 --> 19:45.399
- You're compounding your folly by lying.
- Right on!

19:45.616 --> 19:48.570
Young lady, cow hearts belong
in a butcher's window...

19:48.786 --> 19:52.486
...not the classroom. Well, maybe
in an older student's biology classroom...

19:52.665 --> 19:56.247
...but that's none of my business.
Elementary school is where I wound up...

19:56.418 --> 19:58.743
...and it's too late to do
anything about that.

20:00.214 --> 20:03.490
Frankly, I'm starting to regret
skipping you ahead.

20:15.646 --> 20:19.596
It's the beating of that hideous heart!

20:20.818 --> 20:23.240
I mean, I think I hear something.

20:24.989 --> 20:30.363
Why, here's Allison's real diorama.
It got misplaced, or so it would seem.

20:30.536 --> 20:34.118
Oh, well, that changes everything.
Let's have a look. Get the ribbon ready.

20:36.834 --> 20:39.122
Little sterile.

20:39.294 --> 20:41.252
No real insight.

20:41.422 --> 20:43.331
What do you think, Miss Hoover?

20:45.592 --> 20:47.585
This has been
a very disappointing day.

20:47.761 --> 20:49.553
All right, on to Lisa Simpson.

20:49.763 --> 20:51.920
You're a shoo-in now, Lis.

20:51.265 --> 20:53.838
After the way I've behaved,
I don't deserve to win.

20:54.393 --> 20:56.385
- Well, this doesn't deserve to win.
- What?

20:56.979 --> 21:00.312
Now we're into the dregs.
Here's Ralph Wiggum's entry.

21:00.482 --> 21:04.170
Prepackaged Star Wars characters
still in their display box?

21:04.236 --> 21:05.979
Are those limited edition figures?

21:06.196 --> 21:07.572
What's a diorama?

21:07.781 --> 21:09.525
Why, it's Luke and Obi-Wan.

21:09.700 --> 21:12.452
And my favorite, Chewie.
They're all here!

21:12.620 --> 21:14.279
- What do you think?
- It's lunchtime.

21:14.455 --> 21:15.997
We have a winner!

21:22.212 --> 21:25.249
I'm really sorry about
what I did, Allison.

21:25.424 --> 21:27.749
It's no shame being second to you.

21:27.926 --> 21:29.255
Thank you, Lisa.

21:29.428 --> 21:31.884
You know, I'm actually
kind of glad I lost.

21:32.560 --> 21:35.306
Now I know that losing
isn't the end of the world.

21:35.476 --> 21:37.634
Hey, you still think we can be friends?

21:37.853 --> 21:39.762
Only if we're the best.

21:39.980 --> 21:43.848
I beat the smart kids,
I beat the smart ki...

21:44.680 --> 21:45.977
I bent my Wookiee.

21:46.153 --> 21:49.107
Hey, Ralph. Want to come with me
and Allison to play anagrams?

21:49.281 --> 21:53.326
We take names and rearrange the letters
to form a description of that person.

21:53.494 --> 21:56.670
My cat's breath smells like cat food.

22:54.972 --> 22:57.480
