00:01.234 --> 00:03.671

out of Bob's Burgers.

the most exciting thing
we've ever done!

He was just here.

00:36.370 --> 00:38.339
OLSEN: It's been called
the Beast of the Bay,

00:38.372 --> 00:40.741
The Monster of the Marina

00:40.774 --> 00:42.009
and the Wonder Wolf.

00:42.042 --> 00:43.511
But whatever you call it,

00:43.544 --> 00:45.846
it's allegedly
extremely dangerous

00:45.879 --> 00:49.217
and allegedly out for blood,
wreaking alleged havoc

00:49.250 --> 00:52.019
on our quiet little community,
allegedly.

00:52.052 --> 00:54.188
And it seems to be scaring
the trick-or-treaters

00:54.222 --> 00:55.689
out of town this year

00:55.723 --> 00:58.792
on what promises
to be a foggy night.

00:58.826 --> 01:01.262
Meanwhile, the alpaca
has gone missing

01:01.295 --> 01:03.297
from the Wonder Wharf
petting zoo.

01:03.331 --> 01:05.699
I'm here with Calvin
and Felix Fischoeder.

01:05.733 --> 01:07.535
Could the alpaca
have been a victim

01:07.568 --> 01:09.103
of this so-called
Wonder Wolf?

01:09.137 --> 01:10.771
Oh, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

01:10.804 --> 01:13.907
I'm sure the alpaca just
went on a little walkabout.

01:13.941 --> 01:15.309
Yes, that checks out.

01:15.343 --> 01:17.111
The town is perfectly safe.

01:17.145 --> 01:19.247
All the little children should
go out trick-or-treating...

01:19.280 --> 01:20.948
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
...and then come spend
their parents' money--

01:20.981 --> 01:23.083
I mean, come to Wonder Wharf
and, well, you know.

01:23.117 --> 01:25.753
If you are braving
the local streets for treats,

01:25.786 --> 01:27.888
parents are advised
to accompany their kids

01:27.921 --> 01:30.558
just in case this beast
is more than just a rumor.

01:30.591 --> 01:31.825
It's not.

01:31.859 --> 01:34.061
Oh. No.

01:34.094 --> 01:35.496
* Guess who's
comin' in the room *

01:35.529 --> 01:36.997
* With the fancy costume?

01:37.030 --> 01:39.099
Um, what are you?

01:39.133 --> 01:40.834
I'm a Cher-iff. Get it?

01:40.868 --> 01:42.903
Like Cher, but a sheriff.
Hmm.

01:42.936 --> 01:46.574
I got handcuffs, a badge and
a body that just refuses to age.

01:46.607 --> 01:47.908
(gasps)
Oh, I love her.

01:47.941 --> 01:49.243
"Snap out of it!"
Hmm?

01:49.277 --> 01:50.811
From the movie.
Mm.

01:50.844 --> 01:52.513
You know, if you weren't
on a bunch of pain pills,

01:52.546 --> 01:54.014
you'd be cracking up
right now.

01:54.047 --> 01:55.916
I think those are
making you less fun.

01:55.949 --> 01:57.117
Probably a side effect.

01:57.151 --> 01:58.652
See? "Take with food.

01:58.686 --> 02:01.088
Can cause hallucinations
and diarrhea."

02:01.121 --> 02:03.023
Well, I don't have either
of those except diarrhea,

02:03.056 --> 02:04.425
so give me one.

02:04.458 --> 02:05.759
Fine, but just one.

02:05.793 --> 02:07.528
You get weird
on pain pills.
Mm.

02:07.561 --> 02:09.697
Remember the time you thought
the rug was making fun of you?

02:09.729 --> 02:11.499
Or the time you took
nighttime aspirin

02:11.532 --> 02:13.301
and you ended up
peeing in the blender?

02:13.334 --> 02:15.436
You almost ruined
that smoothie, Bob.

02:15.469 --> 02:18.138
First of all,
I do not remember any of that.

02:18.172 --> 02:20.007
Second, you should've
thrown that smoothie out

02:20.040 --> 02:21.775
if that ever happened.

02:21.809 --> 02:23.677
And third, what am I supposed
to do if I'm in pain?

02:23.711 --> 02:25.213
The-the pills are great
for that.

02:25.246 --> 02:26.447
So...
(clucks tongue)

02:26.480 --> 02:27.881
...give me my drugs, officer.

02:27.915 --> 02:30.184
Okay. If you want to be
a paranoid Patty.

02:30.218 --> 02:32.386
(doorbell rings)
Ah! What was that?

02:32.420 --> 02:33.987
The doorbell.
Calm down.

02:34.021 --> 02:35.223
Right, right. Doorbell.

02:35.256 --> 02:36.390
LINDA:
Coming!

02:36.424 --> 02:37.858
Hold your candy corns!

02:37.891 --> 02:39.493
(door opens)
(Teddy laughs)

02:39.527 --> 02:40.961
TEDDY:
Oh, a Cher-iff.

02:40.994 --> 02:43.130
Oh, that is great.

02:43.163 --> 02:44.832
Doesn't Teddy look hot?

02:44.865 --> 02:46.467
I thought I ordered
a scary nurse,

02:46.500 --> 02:48.669
but I guess I clicked
on sexy nurse instead.

02:48.702 --> 02:50.671
Sometimes the universe
decides, you know?

02:50.704 --> 02:53.307
Anyway, Nurse Teddy is here
to take care of you, Bob.

02:53.341 --> 02:55.676
Uh, Linda, what is
he talking about?

02:55.709 --> 02:57.044
I told you, Bob,
I have to go out

02:57.077 --> 02:58.412
trick-or-treating
with the kids

02:58.446 --> 03:00.414
just in case the
imaginary wolf is real.

03:00.448 --> 03:02.216
Teddy's gonna keep
an eye on you.

03:02.250 --> 03:04.485
You aren't very good on
those crutches, mister.

03:04.518 --> 03:07.154
He fell down twice today
trying to go to the bathroom.

03:07.187 --> 03:08.489
(scoffs)
I'm fine, Lin.

03:08.522 --> 03:10.224
I'll help him get into
the bathroom, no problem.

03:10.258 --> 03:11.759
You can count on me.

03:11.792 --> 03:13.694
I'll even hold your penis
if you need me to, Bob.

03:13.727 --> 03:16.029
I don't need you to
hold my penis, Teddy.

03:16.063 --> 03:17.731
Well, then I can
just, you know,

03:17.765 --> 03:19.199
I can just
prop it up for you.

03:19.233 --> 03:21.435
Use a broom handle
or a dustpan or something.

03:21.469 --> 03:23.170
I guess a spatula
would work.

03:23.203 --> 03:24.772
Great, uh,
where's the spatulas?

03:24.805 --> 03:26.440
I'm joking, Teddy.

03:26.474 --> 03:28.609
I don't need you to hold
my penis up with a spatula.

03:28.642 --> 03:30.110
Right, right, I knew that.

03:30.143 --> 03:31.679
So, how'd you
mess your knee up, anyway?

03:31.712 --> 03:32.946
It's a long story.

03:32.980 --> 03:35.383
Hey, my old chef pants.
I love these.

03:35.416 --> 03:37.251
I wonder if I can
still get into them.

03:37.285 --> 03:38.886
(grunts)

03:38.919 --> 03:40.621
Ow! Ow!

03:40.654 --> 03:42.122
So not that long a story.

03:42.155 --> 03:43.957
No, I guess not.

03:43.991 --> 03:45.359
GENE:
(sings fanfare)

03:45.393 --> 03:46.560
Get ready for your

03:46.594 --> 03:48.529
favorite fruity boy, Gene.

03:48.562 --> 03:50.364
Ooh, grapes.

03:50.398 --> 03:51.765
Handsome grapes.

03:51.799 --> 03:53.534
Sorry, handsome grapes.

03:53.567 --> 03:55.403
Hey, hey, you're The Monkees.

03:55.436 --> 03:57.705
Peter, maybe?
With an oxygen tank?

03:57.738 --> 04:00.408
No, Mom, I'm the guy from
No Country for Old Men.

04:00.441 --> 04:02.042
LINDA:
Ooh, a hunky killer.

04:02.075 --> 04:03.311
The best kind, huh?

04:03.344 --> 04:05.779
Ooh, Tina's a zombie

04:05.813 --> 04:08.416
wearing my clothes
for some reason.

04:08.449 --> 04:09.483
Yeah, I'm a Mom-bie.

04:09.517 --> 04:10.751
But you don't look like a mom

04:10.784 --> 04:12.486
in those clothes;
you look fun and youthful.

04:12.520 --> 04:14.722
In these jeans? No,
I look like a mom.

04:14.755 --> 04:15.823
Young, fun mom.

04:15.856 --> 04:17.124
Well, enough chitchat.

04:17.156 --> 04:18.559
We're burning
precious candy time.

04:18.591 --> 04:19.959
See you sometime
before dawn.

04:19.993 --> 04:21.428
Okay, let me just go
spray my hair

04:21.462 --> 04:22.996
one more time,
and then I'm ready.

04:23.030 --> 04:24.732
Why would you
need to go spray your hair

04:24.765 --> 04:26.266
for us to go trick-or-treating?

04:26.300 --> 04:27.968
LINDA: Because I'm
coming with you.

04:28.001 --> 04:29.670
Uh, no?
Sorry, Mother.

04:29.703 --> 04:32.406
You must be this young to ride
the trick-or-treat train.

04:32.440 --> 04:34.107
Yeah, maybe you
should trick-or-treat

04:34.141 --> 04:35.509
with some friends
your own age, Mom.

04:35.543 --> 04:36.910
Tonight's about fun.

04:36.944 --> 04:38.779
You don't bring a mom
to a fun fight.

04:38.812 --> 04:40.414
What? I'm fun.

04:40.448 --> 04:42.282
Plus, I got to protect you
from that wolf

04:42.316 --> 04:44.685
that's terrorizing the town,
but probably isn't real.

04:44.718 --> 04:47.321
Ugh, I'd be so embarrassed
if you kids got eaten.

04:47.355 --> 04:49.523
(sighs) Fine.
But don't try too hard.

04:49.557 --> 04:52.360
And don't try too hard
at not trying too hard.

04:52.393 --> 04:53.794
I'm gonna be so fun,
you're gonna wish

04:53.827 --> 04:55.329
I trick-or-treated
with you every night.

04:55.363 --> 04:56.530
All right, let's get treatin'.

04:56.564 --> 04:58.298
Yeah,
let's turn some tricks.

04:58.332 --> 04:59.700
Gene, don't say that.

04:59.733 --> 05:02.035
Bye, bye, bye, bye.
Stay out of my room.

05:02.069 --> 05:03.437
TEDDY:
You got it, Mrs. B.

05:03.471 --> 05:05.339
So, what do you want to do?
(door closes)

05:05.373 --> 05:06.607
You can still
thumb wrestle, right?

05:06.640 --> 05:07.808
Best out of 31?

05:07.841 --> 05:09.677
Uh, I was just gonna
watch TV, Teddy.

05:09.710 --> 05:11.779
Okay. Or we could
watch TV. Sure.

05:11.812 --> 05:13.347
ANNOUNCER:
And now, our Halloween feature,

05:13.381 --> 05:14.715
Bosom Bloodies.

05:14.748 --> 05:17.284
Mmm, Bosom Bloodies.
I read the books.

05:17.317 --> 05:19.953
And coming up at 10:00,
an update on the Wonder Wolf.

05:19.987 --> 05:21.188
Ooh.

05:21.221 --> 05:22.723
What was that?
What was what?

05:22.756 --> 05:23.957
Th-That howl.

05:23.991 --> 05:25.493
I just said, "Ooh."

05:25.526 --> 05:26.894
Oh. Oh, okay.

05:26.927 --> 05:28.362
Jeez, you're jumpy, Bob.

05:28.396 --> 05:29.563
You're jumpy, Bob.

05:29.597 --> 05:30.964
ALL:
Trick or treat!

05:30.998 --> 05:32.800
Sorry I don't
have candy.

05:32.833 --> 05:35.068
The news said that no one
would be out trick-or-treating

05:35.102 --> 05:36.470
because of the wolf.

05:36.504 --> 05:37.838
Yeah, we heard.

05:37.871 --> 05:39.840
Kids, what do you say?

05:39.873 --> 05:42.242
KIDS:
Thank you.

05:42.275 --> 05:44.378
At least apples are edible.
I don't know what I'm gonna do

05:44.412 --> 05:46.380
with all these twist ties
from that other house.

05:46.414 --> 05:48.816
This is bull.
I want candy. I'm a kid!

05:48.849 --> 05:51.719
It's not like I can just go out
and buy it whenever I want.

05:51.752 --> 05:53.821
Well, maybe the next block
will be better.

05:53.854 --> 05:55.355
LOUISE:
Damn it! (sighs)

05:55.389 --> 05:57.858
Should we just go home
and eat spoonfuls of sugar?

05:57.891 --> 05:59.527
TINA: I know where
there's a hummingbird feeder.

05:59.560 --> 06:01.194
GENE: I'm ready
for tub and tuck in.

06:01.228 --> 06:02.830
What?
Are you kidding me?

06:02.863 --> 06:05.566
We're not Hallo-quitters,
we're Hallo-winners.

06:05.599 --> 06:07.735
But no houses are giving
out candy, woman.

06:07.768 --> 06:09.737
We don't need candy
to have fun.

06:09.770 --> 06:11.539
You shut your damn mouth.

06:11.572 --> 06:13.340
Hey! Isn't that the park

06:13.373 --> 06:15.275
where people keep
seeing the Wonder Wolf?

06:15.308 --> 06:17.177
Why don't we go over
there and find it.

06:17.210 --> 06:20.514
Searching for a wolf is a
great fun Halloween adventure.

06:20.548 --> 06:22.550
I know this is
gonna sound crazy,

06:22.583 --> 06:24.017
but I'm scared
of wolves.

06:24.051 --> 06:25.385
Yeah, seems dangerous.

06:25.419 --> 06:26.854
That wolf would
probably love to eat

06:26.887 --> 06:29.122
a plump, perfect
boy like moi.

06:29.156 --> 06:31.224
Come on. Are you
guys coming?

06:31.258 --> 06:33.393
(teasingly):
Or are you too scared?

06:33.427 --> 06:34.862
Fine, but I'm gonna
walk in the middle

06:34.895 --> 06:36.564
to protect my beautiful grapes,

06:36.597 --> 06:39.366
and for once, I'm not talking
about my testicles.

06:39.399 --> 06:41.769
LOUISE: I guess it's kind of
a good Halloween thing to do.

06:41.802 --> 06:44.572
But if don't see a wolf,
I want my money back.

06:44.605 --> 06:46.206
All right!
Hello, lady Bob.

06:46.239 --> 06:47.808
Hey, Mr. Fischoeder.

06:47.841 --> 06:49.877
You out trick-or-treatin'?
Smellin' feetin'?

06:49.910 --> 06:52.412
We're out looking
for our alpaca, Al.

06:52.446 --> 06:53.881
Have you seen him?

06:53.914 --> 06:55.949
No. We're going to
look for the wolf.

06:55.983 --> 06:58.919
(laughs): The wolf.
Wolves aren't real, Linda.

06:58.952 --> 07:01.421
Okay, well, we're gonna go
look for one anyway

07:01.455 --> 07:03.223
because it's
a fun Halloween adventure,

07:03.256 --> 07:04.492
and I'm a fun mom.

07:04.525 --> 07:05.759
Well, if I were you,

07:05.793 --> 07:07.995
I'd go home and
count your candy

07:08.028 --> 07:10.130
and wait for
St. Nick or Satan.

07:10.163 --> 07:12.265
Whatever.
I-I can... Bye.

07:12.299 --> 07:13.601
(woman screams)

07:13.634 --> 07:15.168
(gasps) Oh!

07:15.202 --> 07:16.837
Here you go, Bob.
It's a cabbage soup

07:16.870 --> 07:18.271
that's supposed
to heal the body.

07:18.305 --> 07:19.973
I got the recipe
from a pop-up ad.

07:20.007 --> 07:22.342
I just put in my social security
number and there it was.

07:22.375 --> 07:23.977
I'm not really in a soup mood.

07:24.011 --> 07:25.445
That's impossible.
I-I'm gonna feed it to you.

07:25.479 --> 07:27.114
No, no, just give
it to me. I...

07:27.147 --> 07:28.582
I'm gonna feed it to you.
I don't want you to do that.

07:28.616 --> 07:29.850
Just let me feed it to you.

07:29.883 --> 07:31.184
Here comes the helicopter.

07:31.218 --> 07:32.853
Open up your mouth, Bobby.

07:32.886 --> 07:34.354
Here it comes.

07:34.387 --> 07:36.189
Uh-huh. Uh...
Traffic copter.
Here he comes.

07:36.223 --> 07:37.858
Oh, you got a little...
What do you mean
the traffic copter?

07:37.891 --> 07:39.527
It's just...
It's a traffic copter.

07:39.560 --> 07:41.328
It's flying into your
mouth here.
Why does it...

07:41.361 --> 07:43.363
Just a regular helicopter
is usually the way.
Just...

07:43.396 --> 07:44.998
It's a traffic copter. You got
a little bit of a back up...
Okay.

07:45.032 --> 07:46.299
...here on 95.
All right,
all right, all right.

07:46.333 --> 07:47.968
If you're traveling north...

07:48.001 --> 07:49.870
Whatever type of
helicopter you want.
If you could just...

07:49.903 --> 07:51.772
Let me do my thing,
Bobby!
Fine.

07:51.805 --> 07:53.541
Oh. Ow! Ow!
What? What? What? What?

07:53.574 --> 07:56.109
It's too hot.
I'll blow on it
a little bit here.

07:56.143 --> 07:58.145
(blowing)

07:58.178 --> 08:00.047
Teddy, you're spitting on it.
No, I'm not.
I-I'm blowing on it.

08:00.080 --> 08:01.348
You're going...
(blows raspberry)

08:01.381 --> 08:03.050
This is how I blow.
What's that mark

08:03.083 --> 08:04.284
on your arm?

08:04.317 --> 08:05.653
What mark? I don't...

08:05.686 --> 08:07.154
There's no mark on my arm.

08:07.187 --> 08:08.656
You just covered it
with your sleeve.

08:08.689 --> 08:10.524
Looks like a bite.
No, it's not a bite.

08:10.558 --> 08:12.392
It's dry skin.
You ever heard of dry skin?

08:12.425 --> 08:14.728
Ow! Still way too hot, Teddy.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

08:14.762 --> 08:16.530
This is, like,
room temperature now, Bobby.

08:16.564 --> 08:18.298
You think that's
room temperature?
Yes.

08:18.331 --> 08:19.833
Stick your finger in it.
Okay.

08:19.867 --> 08:21.468
(both scream)

08:21.501 --> 08:23.003
It's fine. It's fine.

08:23.036 --> 08:24.572
LINDA:
Ooh, look, a bone.

08:24.605 --> 08:26.373
Must be from some animal

08:26.406 --> 08:27.708
the wolf killed
and devoured.

08:27.741 --> 08:29.042
I think that's a hanger, Mom?

08:29.076 --> 08:30.878
No, it's a bone.

08:30.911 --> 08:33.179
It's a little metal bone with
dry cleaning paper on it.

08:33.212 --> 08:35.482
This is dumb.
There's no wolf.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.818
Let's just go home
and trade apples with each other

08:37.851 --> 08:40.053
till we die of boredom.
Yeah.

08:40.087 --> 08:42.255
Okay, fine. I tried.

08:42.289 --> 08:43.523
(wolf howls)

08:43.557 --> 08:44.725
Mmm?
Whoa.

08:44.758 --> 08:46.594
Mom, did you do that?
No.

08:46.627 --> 08:49.096
That did sound like
one of Mom's chardonnay farts.

08:49.129 --> 08:50.898
I don't think
that was a real howl.

08:50.931 --> 08:52.499
(wolf howls)
(gasps)

08:52.532 --> 08:54.668
Well, howl-lelujah.

08:54.702 --> 08:57.370
I guess the Wonder Wolf is real.

09:00.307 --> 09:01.909
I got to give you credit, toots.

09:01.942 --> 09:04.011
I thought you were
the mom that cried wolf,

09:04.044 --> 09:05.946
but I think this guy's
the real deal.

09:05.979 --> 09:07.915
And that's a good thing.
(laughs nervously)

09:07.948 --> 09:09.617
Because we want it
to be real.

09:09.650 --> 09:11.351
Yeah, yeah, we want it to be.

09:11.384 --> 09:12.620
Of course we do.

09:12.653 --> 09:14.254
Everyone stay close to Mommy.

09:14.287 --> 09:16.857
Okay. I always wanted
to be raised by wolves,

09:16.890 --> 09:20.060
but getting adopted by one at
this age would also be cool.

09:20.093 --> 09:21.929
Getting a little foggy out.
I like it.

09:21.962 --> 09:23.764
It's nice and spooky.

09:23.797 --> 09:25.232
(wolf howls)
(gasps)

09:25.265 --> 09:26.600
Whoa.
Wow.

09:26.634 --> 09:27.968
I'm not saying
I'm impressed,

09:28.001 --> 09:29.637
but I'm not
not impressed.

09:29.670 --> 09:31.471
It came from over
there, let's go.

09:31.504 --> 09:33.040
LINDA:
* Going over there

09:33.073 --> 09:34.474
* It's getting kind of real

09:34.507 --> 09:36.276
* But the kids are having fun

09:36.309 --> 09:38.211
* So we're going over there.

09:38.245 --> 09:39.947
LOUISE: All right,
not so much singing.
Oh, sorry.

09:39.980 --> 09:41.749
Teddy, my knee really hurts.

09:41.782 --> 09:44.451
Ca-Can you hand me another pill?
Uh, I don't know, Bob.

09:44.484 --> 09:46.319
Linda didn't say anything
about giving you another pill.

09:46.353 --> 09:48.255
Yeah, well, she's
forgetful. I mean, look,

09:48.288 --> 09:50.457
she forgot her handcuffs.
Yeah, I don't, uh...

09:50.490 --> 09:52.760
I don't think
that's a good idea, Bobby.
Come on, Teddy.

09:52.793 --> 09:55.262
I'm in pain.
I don't know. How many
have you had tonight?

09:55.295 --> 09:57.164
Maybe one and
a half, or two.

09:57.197 --> 09:59.232
Are you sure you don't
want one for your bite?

09:59.266 --> 10:00.467
It looks serious.

10:00.500 --> 10:02.402
I-I don't need a pill
for my bite.

10:02.435 --> 10:03.771
Wait, you said it wasn't a bite.

10:03.804 --> 10:05.272
It's not.
You called it that.

10:05.305 --> 10:06.606
Watch the movie,
huh, Bob?

10:06.640 --> 10:07.908
Give me a pill.
Fine.

10:07.941 --> 10:09.342
Here, I'm gonna
cut this in half.

10:09.376 --> 10:11.444
Eat both halves.
That's a weird way

10:11.478 --> 10:13.080
of regulating
how much I take.

10:13.113 --> 10:15.182
Well, then I know
you at least had two halves.

10:15.215 --> 10:17.651
Look at us
tracking a wild animal

10:17.685 --> 10:18.852
like it's no big deal.

10:18.886 --> 10:20.320
Yeah, I haven't
had this much fun

10:20.353 --> 10:21.755
following
in somebody's footsteps

10:21.789 --> 10:23.256
since I started
dressing like Mom.

10:23.290 --> 10:25.492
Earlier today.
LOUISE: Oh, my God, you guys.

10:25.525 --> 10:28.295
Poop.
Okay, I'll see what I can do.

10:28.328 --> 10:31.198
Short notice.
No, I think
it's the wolf's poop.

10:31.231 --> 10:33.633
Ooh, a spooky poopy.

10:33.667 --> 10:35.302
There's little bits
of fur in it.

10:35.335 --> 10:38.038
This was definitely
not pooped by a person.

10:38.071 --> 10:39.439
But if it was,

10:39.472 --> 10:41.174
I admire the heck out of them.
(loud rustling)

10:41.208 --> 10:42.609
(all scream)
Oh, God.

10:42.642 --> 10:44.277
It came from right over there.

10:44.311 --> 10:46.146
Okay, I think he's...

10:46.179 --> 10:49.582
TINA: Or she's.
Or she's behind that bush.

10:51.584 --> 10:53.020
(door creaks on TV)

10:53.053 --> 10:55.522
Oh, no, no, no,
don't go in there.

10:55.555 --> 10:57.825
(panting)

10:57.858 --> 11:01.528
(distorted):
Oh, no! You went in.

11:01.561 --> 11:03.563
He went in!

11:04.597 --> 11:06.233
Uh, uh,

11:06.266 --> 11:07.968
are you sure that's not
a bite, Teddy?

11:08.001 --> 11:09.402
Like, from an animal?

11:09.436 --> 11:11.038
No. How many times
I got to say it?

11:11.071 --> 11:12.873
Okay. Then-then wh--
then what is it?

11:12.906 --> 11:15.575
I cut it... on my... pillow.

11:15.608 --> 11:16.844
I'm gonna go to
the bathroom now.

11:16.877 --> 11:18.578
If that's okay with you.

11:18.611 --> 11:20.814
And number one,
since you're so nosey.

11:20.848 --> 11:23.216
ANNOUNCER: Was the Wonder Wolf
just a Wonder myth?

11:23.250 --> 11:25.585
Stay tuned after
our feature presentation.

11:25.618 --> 11:26.920
(whispers):
The wolf.

11:26.954 --> 11:28.188
Teddy's a werewolf.

11:28.221 --> 11:29.389
TEDDY:
What'd you say, Bob?

11:29.422 --> 11:31.524
Nothing.
No, he can't be.

11:31.558 --> 11:33.526
He can't be a werewolf,
that's crazy.

11:33.560 --> 11:34.995
(Teddy growling)

11:35.028 --> 11:36.864
Oh, no.
He's transforming.

11:36.897 --> 11:38.665
He's transforming.

11:38.698 --> 11:41.001
(Bob groans)
(Teddy growling)

11:41.034 --> 11:42.736
(grunting)

11:42.770 --> 11:44.004
(Bob groaning)

11:44.037 --> 11:45.072
Oh, God.

11:46.273 --> 11:48.241
(groans)

11:48.275 --> 11:49.542
Oh, hi, Teddy.

11:49.576 --> 11:50.744
You okay?
You look sweaty.

11:50.778 --> 11:51.945
Yeah. It's just, uh,

11:51.979 --> 11:53.613
an exciting part
of the movie.

11:53.646 --> 11:55.883
I-I think something's
gonna happen to somebody.

11:55.916 --> 11:57.684
You're probably right.
Yeah, definitely.

11:57.717 --> 11:59.186
(grunts)
Oh, God.

11:59.219 --> 12:01.088
Oh, my God. Bob! Bob!
Ah-ha!

12:01.121 --> 12:03.123
Gotcha!
(Teddy yells)

12:03.156 --> 12:04.925
Bob, what? Why?
Why'd you do that?

12:04.958 --> 12:06.860
Because you're a
werewolf, Teddy.
(grunts)

12:06.894 --> 12:10.363
I heard you fighting
the beast inside you.

12:10.397 --> 12:12.465
What?
You're the Wonder Wolf!

12:12.499 --> 12:14.434
Or he bit you and
you're turning into one.

12:14.467 --> 12:15.803
Or you bit him.
Bob...

12:15.836 --> 12:17.871
Or, or however
this all works.

12:17.905 --> 12:19.139
Bob... (grunts) unlock me.

12:19.172 --> 12:20.740
(grunts)
Unlock me!

12:20.774 --> 12:22.575
You need to sit down.
You need to rest your leg.

12:22.609 --> 12:23.811
Give me the
keys, come on.

12:23.844 --> 12:24.978
Oh.
This isn't funny.

12:25.012 --> 12:26.780
Oh. These keys?
(gulps)

12:26.814 --> 12:28.782
(mouth full): No way.
Because I'm swallowing them.

12:28.816 --> 12:30.217
(gags and coughs)

12:30.250 --> 12:31.985
No. Wait, that's impossible.

12:32.019 --> 12:34.087
(coughs) Ugh.
How do people do that in movies?

12:34.121 --> 12:35.622
(grunts)

12:35.655 --> 12:38.058
Bob, don't try to go
down the stairs.

12:38.091 --> 12:39.392
(Bob screams)
(clattering down stairs)

12:39.426 --> 12:42.095
BOB: Ow, ow!
(Teddy grunting)

12:42.129 --> 12:43.496
Are you okay?
(Bob shouting)

12:43.530 --> 12:45.966
Bobby, answer me.
(grunts)

12:45.999 --> 12:48.936
No, I'm fine, Teddy.
I only fell halfway dow--

12:48.969 --> 12:50.170
(Bob screams)
Ow...

12:50.203 --> 12:52.272
Ow! Ow!
(groans)

12:52.305 --> 12:53.807
Oh, oh, God!

12:53.841 --> 12:55.675
Are you at the bottom
of the stairs now?

12:55.708 --> 12:56.944
Wouldn't you
like to kno--

12:56.977 --> 12:58.812
(Bob screams)

12:58.846 --> 13:00.680
Bob, talk to me.
Say something.

13:00.713 --> 13:02.850
Don't pretend like you
care about me, werewolf.

13:02.883 --> 13:05.685
No, Bob. No, Bobby, don't leave!
(door closes)

13:05.718 --> 13:07.620
What'll we do now, Mom?

13:07.654 --> 13:10.690
We are gonna take a picture
of the wolf on my phone,

13:10.723 --> 13:14.361
from a very, very safe distance,
and then run away.

13:14.394 --> 13:16.629
GENE: Oh, God.
It's rustling again.

13:16.663 --> 13:19.799
What kind of a monster
rustles this much?
(moans)

13:19.833 --> 13:21.935
I'm gonna go over
and pull the branches back.

13:21.969 --> 13:23.803
You kids stay back here
and take the picture,

13:23.837 --> 13:25.372
and then run away.

13:25.405 --> 13:26.840
Okay, here we go.

13:26.874 --> 13:28.375
"Spooky Halloween adventure

13:28.408 --> 13:30.210
with a fun mom" on three.

13:30.243 --> 13:31.644
One, two...

13:31.678 --> 13:32.880
...three.
(yells)

13:32.913 --> 13:34.014
(all scream)

13:34.047 --> 13:35.048
LINDA:
Randy.

13:35.082 --> 13:36.349
LOUISE:
Dad's frenemy?

13:36.383 --> 13:37.517
TINA:
Slash filmmaker?

13:37.550 --> 13:38.886
Slash wolf hunter.

13:38.919 --> 13:40.120
Slash your fly's down.

13:40.153 --> 13:42.555
Slash made you look
at your ding-dong.

13:44.591 --> 13:47.627
The wolf is right... there.
Did you see it?

13:47.660 --> 13:49.162
Uh...
No.

13:49.196 --> 13:50.730
See what?
The wolf.

13:50.763 --> 13:52.332
Right there.
The wolf is in that shot.

13:52.365 --> 13:53.666
The shot that's
completely black?

13:53.700 --> 13:55.135
Yes. I forgot a light,

13:55.168 --> 13:56.569
but that doesn't mean
he's not there.

13:56.603 --> 13:58.205
Or she.
Wait.

13:58.238 --> 13:59.973
Do you really think this wolf
or whatever is real?

14:00.007 --> 14:02.209
You saw it?
Oh, it's real.

14:02.242 --> 14:04.044
I'm pretty sure.
I'm convinced.

14:04.077 --> 14:05.345
Yep. And I'm gonna be the guy

14:05.378 --> 14:06.846
who gets the footage
to prove it.

14:06.880 --> 14:08.815
I'll be famous.
I'll be "The Wolf Guy."

14:08.848 --> 14:10.817
My documentary will make
millions of dollars,

14:10.850 --> 14:12.652
and I'll probably get a wife.

14:12.685 --> 14:14.687
Millions of dollars, huh?
Randy, baby.

14:14.721 --> 14:16.323
Why don't we work out a deal?

14:16.356 --> 14:18.191
We help you
get this thing on film,

14:18.225 --> 14:20.393
and then we
split the money 50-50.

14:20.427 --> 14:22.195
Why would I want to
team up with you?

14:22.229 --> 14:24.097
We've got light.
We've got gumption.

14:24.131 --> 14:25.665
And we all
want wives, too.

14:25.698 --> 14:27.267
I'm gonna name mine
"Michelle."

14:27.300 --> 14:29.903
Kids, maybe we should just
let Randy find the wolf,

14:29.937 --> 14:31.939
and then we'll go see the movie
when it's done.

14:31.972 --> 14:34.041
Well, I do need light.

14:34.074 --> 14:35.375
Yeah. You do.

14:35.408 --> 14:36.776
Okay, you can help.

14:36.809 --> 14:39.379
Uh, hmm, all right.
But I get to pick

14:39.412 --> 14:41.214
where we have the premiere.
No, you don't.

14:41.248 --> 14:43.183
TINA: Hey, we could have it
at the restaurant.
Fine.

14:43.216 --> 14:44.617
But let's get it catered.

14:44.651 --> 14:46.119
RANDY: Ooh, yes.
And a photo booth.

14:46.153 --> 14:47.720
(panting)
Okay.

14:47.754 --> 14:49.589
Okay, I got to find someone
to help me.

14:49.622 --> 14:52.259
Oh, that was smart of me to
chain him to the coffee table.

14:52.292 --> 14:55.195
Smart of me and dumb of him.

14:55.228 --> 14:58.731
Dumb werewolf Teddy.
(laughs)

14:58.765 --> 15:01.634
(pants and grunts)

15:01.668 --> 15:03.436
Bob, I'm coming!

15:03.470 --> 15:05.138
Oh, no. Oh, no.

15:05.172 --> 15:06.706
(pants)

15:06.739 --> 15:08.508
(panting)

15:10.010 --> 15:11.945
(grunting)

15:11.979 --> 15:14.381
(breathless): Wow, running
with a coffee table's hard.

15:14.414 --> 15:16.316
No wonder no one does that.

15:16.349 --> 15:18.385
(gasping)

15:18.418 --> 15:20.120
(gasping):
Bobby! Bob!

15:20.153 --> 15:21.921
You can't get away, Bob.

15:21.955 --> 15:23.423
(groaning):
I'll find you.

15:23.456 --> 15:24.824
I'm gonna help you.

15:24.857 --> 15:26.793
(breathless):
Good evening.

15:26.826 --> 15:28.461
Happy Halloween.

15:28.495 --> 15:30.630
I'm a nurse table,
table nurse.

15:30.663 --> 15:32.932
Farewell. (laughs)

15:32.966 --> 15:34.801
LINDA:
Maybe we should head home soon.

15:34.834 --> 15:37.770
It's getting late and
we've already had so much fun.

15:37.804 --> 15:39.839
(scoffs)
Home is for idiots.

15:39.872 --> 15:41.408
Yeah. We're wolf
hunters now.

15:41.441 --> 15:42.942
Our old lives
were garbage.

15:42.976 --> 15:45.645
I thought mine was okay,
but I see what you mean.

15:45.678 --> 15:47.780
Okay. Here's a wolf-hunting tip.

15:47.814 --> 15:50.183
See the way these leaves
are all on the ground?

15:50.217 --> 15:53.120
Probably the wolf came through
here and knocked them all down.

15:53.153 --> 15:54.921
Aren't those just fall leaves?

15:54.954 --> 15:57.257
Fall leaves, at
this time of year?

15:57.290 --> 15:58.992
Don't be ridiculous.
(screeching)

15:59.026 --> 16:00.593
(gasps)
(quietly):
What the hell was that?

16:00.627 --> 16:01.794
The wolf.
No. Wolves howl.

16:01.828 --> 16:03.096
That was not a howl.

16:03.130 --> 16:04.531
It sounded like
the noise I made

16:04.564 --> 16:06.199
when Felicity
cut her hair.

16:06.233 --> 16:07.867
What if this isn't just a wolf?

16:07.900 --> 16:10.803
Maybe it's a super wolf
or a monster wolf.

16:10.837 --> 16:13.773
(gasps) A werewolf.
(screeching)

16:13.806 --> 16:16.676
Well, whatever it is,
it sounds like it's in there.

16:16.709 --> 16:18.378
TINA: Oh, that spooky,
overgrown area

16:18.411 --> 16:20.147
that looks like it's
full of Blair Witches?

16:20.180 --> 16:22.315
LOUISE:
Yep. And we're going
into that overgrown

16:22.349 --> 16:24.384
Blair Witch tunnel.
Right, Mom?

16:24.417 --> 16:26.386
Yeah, of course we are.

16:26.419 --> 16:30.023
I said we were going,
so we are. So, yeah, yeah.

16:30.057 --> 16:32.859
GENE: And with that rousing
speech, we march to our deaths.

16:32.892 --> 16:34.061
(grunts)

16:34.094 --> 16:35.328
TEDDY:
Bob!

16:35.362 --> 16:36.696
Bob, I'm coming!

16:36.729 --> 16:38.898
(laughs) I know you're coming,
wolf-Teddy.

16:38.931 --> 16:40.533
That's why I'm going...

16:40.567 --> 16:41.701
into the park.

16:41.734 --> 16:42.902
I'll hide in there.

16:42.935 --> 16:44.571
Good job, Bob.
Thank you.

16:45.572 --> 16:47.240
What is this place?

16:47.274 --> 16:48.908
Huh. Is this a dead end?

16:48.941 --> 16:50.577
Don't be silly, Linda.

16:50.610 --> 16:52.079
There aren't dead ends
in the woods.

16:52.112 --> 16:53.546
You can just walk
right into the...

16:53.580 --> 16:55.014
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

16:55.048 --> 16:56.816
Okay, so it's a dead end.
Guys, guys,

16:56.849 --> 16:59.652
guys, guys, guys, guys, guys.
(all scream)

16:59.686 --> 17:01.554
I don't like piles of bones
unless they're on a plate

17:01.588 --> 17:03.823
in front of me and I'm rubbing
my stomach, going, "Mmm-mmm."

17:03.856 --> 17:05.492
(screeching)

17:05.525 --> 17:06.925
Oh, God, it's getting closer.

17:06.959 --> 17:08.060
Randy, get the camera ready.

17:08.095 --> 17:09.061
Uh...

17:09.096 --> 17:10.196
Dammit, Randy.

17:10.230 --> 17:11.731
If you had been
holding something,

17:11.763 --> 17:13.266
you would have dropped it
out of fright, too, Louise.

17:13.300 --> 17:14.701
I'm holding two things.
(rustling)

17:14.733 --> 17:16.703
Oh, God.
(moans)

17:16.736 --> 17:18.238
Kids, get behind me.

17:18.271 --> 17:19.539
And I'll
get behind them.

17:19.571 --> 17:20.839
Randy, no, you're a grown-up.

17:20.873 --> 17:22.075
Not in all ways,
Linda.

17:22.108 --> 17:23.843
I wear a youth large
at Forever 21.

17:23.876 --> 17:25.412
(screeching)
RANDY: Oh, God. Oh, God.

17:25.444 --> 17:27.347
I'm really regretting
sprinkling cinnamon and sugar

17:27.380 --> 17:29.249
on myself this morning.

17:33.553 --> 17:35.455
Oh, my God. I brought my kids
out into the dark woods

17:35.488 --> 17:37.257
on purpose to look for
a dangerous animal,

17:37.290 --> 17:39.192
just because I wanted you guys
to think I was fun.

17:39.226 --> 17:41.094
Now I think I might
have made a mistake,

17:41.128 --> 17:43.196
and it would have been better if
we weren't attacked by a wolf.

17:43.230 --> 17:45.565
Guys, maybe if we're all
just really, really quiet,

17:45.598 --> 17:48.135
the wolf will lose
interest and go away.

17:48.168 --> 17:49.569
It's worth a try.

17:49.602 --> 17:51.471
(balloons pop, Gene yells)

17:51.504 --> 17:52.972
Gene.
Sorry.

17:53.005 --> 17:54.974
If we all die, everybody,
thanks for being cool.

17:55.007 --> 17:56.309
You're welcome.

17:56.343 --> 17:58.545
Oh, Randy. I forgot
you were here.
Mm.

17:58.578 --> 17:59.812
Okay, that's it.

17:59.846 --> 18:01.047
Kids, you stay here.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.315
I'm going to fight this thing.

18:02.349 --> 18:04.151
Good idea.
You go get it, Linda.

18:04.184 --> 18:06.819
Mother, I've never been
more attracted to you.

18:06.853 --> 18:08.455
I'll fight it off
as long as I can,

18:08.488 --> 18:10.223
and then when
I can't fight anymore,

18:10.257 --> 18:12.125
I'll try to be hard to eat
so you guys can get away.

18:12.159 --> 18:13.326
GENE:
Okay.

18:13.360 --> 18:15.495
Oh, my God.

18:15.528 --> 18:16.663
(all screaming)

18:16.696 --> 18:17.664
(screams)

18:17.697 --> 18:19.599
LOUISE:
What the...?

18:19.632 --> 18:21.268
Are you freaking kidding me?

18:21.301 --> 18:23.803
Wolves these days,
not what I remember.

18:23.836 --> 18:27.340
I think it's the alpaca
from the petting zoo.

18:27.374 --> 18:29.342
So there was no wolf?

18:29.376 --> 18:30.610
Huh, I guess not,

18:30.643 --> 18:32.345
but this guy's
kind of fun,

18:32.379 --> 18:34.647
in a matted hair,
lice-y kind of way.

18:34.681 --> 18:36.249
I'm gonna pet him.

18:36.283 --> 18:37.784
Hi, cutie.
What's your...

18:37.817 --> 18:39.519
(screeches)
Oh, never mind,
never mind.

18:39.552 --> 18:41.421
*

18:41.454 --> 18:44.191
TEDDY: Bob!
BOB: Oh, no. He found me.

18:44.224 --> 18:46.193
(grunting and panting)

18:46.226 --> 18:48.328
(rustling)

18:50.363 --> 18:52.165
Teddy?

18:54.701 --> 18:56.703
(growls, snarls)

18:56.736 --> 18:58.371
Uh...

19:03.142 --> 19:04.944
There you are, Lulu.
You naughty girl.

19:04.977 --> 19:06.479
You're gonna get daddy
in trouble

19:06.513 --> 19:08.515
(laughs):
escaping like that.

19:08.548 --> 19:10.850
I told you you weren't ready
to have a wolf, Felix.

19:10.883 --> 19:12.452
I am ready.

19:12.485 --> 19:14.521
The wolf house I was building
wasn't ready.

19:14.554 --> 19:17.957
And I am not putting her up
in a hotel again!

19:17.990 --> 19:19.692
Oh, just hurry up
and put her into the van.

19:19.726 --> 19:21.828
We still have to find
that damned alpaca.

19:21.861 --> 19:23.996
Come on, Lulu. I brought
a Hawaiian pizza for you.

19:24.030 --> 19:26.466
(sniffs)
(singsongy): Your favorite.

19:26.499 --> 19:28.401
(Lulu whines)
There we go.

19:28.435 --> 19:29.802
Go, go, go, go, Calvin.

19:29.836 --> 19:31.003
I'm going!

19:31.037 --> 19:32.171
Yay!

19:32.205 --> 19:34.541
(Teddy panting)

19:34.574 --> 19:36.209
Bob, don't run.

19:36.243 --> 19:37.677
(strained voice):
Wolf.

19:37.710 --> 19:39.178
I know, I know, Bob.

19:39.212 --> 19:40.880
I'm a wolf.

19:40.913 --> 19:42.915
But let's go home and
talk about it there, okay?

19:42.949 --> 19:44.551
I just saw a wolf.

19:44.584 --> 19:46.353
Sure, sure.
You-you saw a wolf.

19:46.386 --> 19:48.588
You don't happen to have the
handcuff keys, do you, Bobby?

19:48.621 --> 19:50.022
Huh? You know what?

19:50.056 --> 19:51.424
Never mind.

19:51.458 --> 19:54.227
I have to carry this
back anyway. (grunts)

19:54.261 --> 19:56.663
Look, I know the pills
made me crazy before,

19:56.696 --> 19:58.998
but in my defense, Teddy does
have a bite on his arm,

19:59.031 --> 20:01.033
and hair all over
the back of his neck.

20:01.067 --> 20:02.869
I do have a bite.
I was embarrassed to tell you

20:02.902 --> 20:04.571
that I bit myself in my sleep.

20:04.604 --> 20:07.507
I used to do it in my 20s,
and then again in my 30s,

20:07.540 --> 20:08.775
and now, apparently, it's back.

20:08.808 --> 20:10.277
Someone needs
to be swaddled.

20:10.310 --> 20:11.878
Or just bite your
arms during the day,

20:11.911 --> 20:13.280
so you won't be as
tempted at night.

20:13.313 --> 20:15.114
(sighs)
Well, sorry, kids.

20:15.147 --> 20:17.216
This Halloween
was kind of a bust.

20:17.250 --> 20:19.218
You didn't get any candy
and there wasn't a wolf.

20:19.252 --> 20:20.587
(groans)
There was.

20:20.620 --> 20:21.954
No. It was an alpaca.

20:21.988 --> 20:23.623
I mean, a wolf
in our little town?

20:23.656 --> 20:24.924
It's crazy.

20:24.957 --> 20:26.526
This isn't Transylvania.

20:26.559 --> 20:28.194
Yeah, but there was
almost a wolf.

20:28.227 --> 20:29.629
And we thought
we were gonna die.

20:29.662 --> 20:31.097
That was fun.

20:31.130 --> 20:33.132
Wait. Are you saying
you had fun with me?

20:33.165 --> 20:36.068
We're saying we
had fun around you.

20:36.102 --> 20:37.236
That counts.

20:37.270 --> 20:38.871
There was a wolf.
I saw it.

20:38.905 --> 20:40.473
The Fischoeders
put it in their van.

20:40.507 --> 20:41.741
This again.

20:41.774 --> 20:43.610
Shh, shh, shh, shh, Bob, Bob.

20:43.643 --> 20:45.144
I did see a wolf.

20:45.177 --> 20:46.646
Hey. I believe you, Bob.

20:46.679 --> 20:48.315
Randy, I don't want you
to be offended,

20:48.348 --> 20:50.983
but I need someone other
than you to believe me.

20:51.017 --> 20:52.151
Well, I am offended.

20:52.184 --> 20:53.486
Are you going home,
Randy?

20:53.520 --> 20:55.488
Not now. Now I'm
staying forever.

20:55.522 --> 20:57.056
Me, too, because I'm handcuffed

20:57.089 --> 20:58.758
to your coffee table
and you lost the keys.

20:58.791 --> 21:00.159
I-I didn't lose them, Teddy.

21:00.192 --> 21:01.661
I threw them to the moon.

21:01.694 --> 21:03.663
It made sense at the time.

21:03.696 --> 21:05.565
All right. I'll get you guys
some sheets and blankets.

21:05.598 --> 21:07.600
No, Linda.
They're not staying.

21:07.634 --> 21:09.736
RANDY:
Can I borrow some pajamas, Bob?
Maybe an oversized tee?

21:09.769 --> 21:11.404
BOB:
Absolutely not.

21:11.438 --> 21:13.105
GENE: I've got
your oversized tee, Randy.

21:13.139 --> 21:14.607
One question:
do you like Betty Boop?

21:14.641 --> 21:15.908
RANDY:
Yep.

21:15.942 --> 21:18.511
(Linda growling rhythmically)

21:18.545 --> 21:22.081
All right!
