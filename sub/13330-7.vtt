WEBVTT

00:09.109 --> 00:12.379
We're back and it's gonna be
bigger and better than ever.

00:12.445 --> 00:15.248
Bucking, birds and banter.
Two new housemates?

00:15.315 --> 00:18.118
I grill more birds
than George Foreman. Alreet?

00:18.184 --> 00:20.987
I'm young, I'm fresh
and I love bucking birds.

00:21.054 --> 00:23.556
Not on the first fucking night.
(all cheer)

00:23.623 --> 00:25.492
The biggest argument ever.

00:25.558 --> 00:27.827
Engagement party's
been a fucking joke.

00:27.894 --> 00:29.896
It all ends in tears.
(smashing)

00:29.963 --> 00:31.531
I'm still in shock.

00:31.598 --> 00:33.466
Drink after drink after drink.

00:33.533 --> 00:36.503
I'm not gonna let him
fucking ruin my night.

00:36.569 --> 00:38.338
You're a fucking arsehole!

00:38.405 --> 00:39.906
You're a fucking psycho!

00:39.973 --> 00:41.441
He's a fucking bell end.

00:41.508 --> 00:45.044
Give me the ring.
Fuck me, is this ever gonna settle?

00:45.111 --> 00:47.747
I'm on a rampage.

00:47.814 --> 00:49.249
Psycho Charlotte is back.

00:50.850 --> 00:52.952
It's prank night.
(screams)

00:53.787 --> 00:56.289
So, this minute in time,
I'm gonna leave.

00:56.356 --> 00:59.159
I don't know how I'm gonna
do this without him.

00:59.225 --> 01:00.393
I'm gutted.

01:04.431 --> 01:06.332
I should have a degree in pulling.

01:06.399 --> 01:08.501
I am a Geordie girl with a VIP edge.

01:08.568 --> 01:10.970
If you look up pulling,
my name's next to it.

01:11.037 --> 01:13.139
I never kiss anyone
with no six-pack.

01:13.206 --> 01:15.241
I'm gonna tear the place up.

01:15.308 --> 01:17.210
I could talk the legs off a donkey.

01:17.277 --> 01:19.012
Got looks, charm. It works.

01:19.078 --> 01:21.414
I'm fit, I'm flirty
and I've got double Fs.

01:21.481 --> 01:23.917
The hardest graft I've done
is doing my hair.

01:23.983 --> 01:26.052
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

01:35.762 --> 01:40.934
# Oh-oh, sometimes
I get a good feeling

01:41.000 --> 01:42.368
# Yeah

01:43.570 --> 01:48.141
# I get a feeling that I never,
Never, never, never had before #

01:48.208 --> 01:51.344
The look of an egg
makes us feel sick.

01:51.411 --> 01:53.246
Don't smell it, just eat it.

01:53.313 --> 01:57.183
The smell of an egg
makes us feel sick.

01:57.250 --> 01:59.252
You've never had scrambled egg?
No.

01:59.319 --> 02:01.855
That is why I have never
tried eggs before.

02:01.921 --> 02:06.059
It's beyond me how any adult
can get to the age of 22

02:06.125 --> 02:08.228
and have not tried an egg.

02:08.294 --> 02:10.263
The yoke, the best bit?

02:10.330 --> 02:13.266
That's the bit that's gonna
be the baby chick.

02:13.333 --> 02:15.768
It's like foetus of a chicken.

02:15.835 --> 02:19.772
Why would anyone wanna eat that
poor chicken's birth of the child?

02:19.839 --> 02:22.809
It's like an ovary.
Oh, my god.

02:22.876 --> 02:24.077
That's the placenta.

02:24.143 --> 02:27.280
I'm putting a fucking ban to this.
Eggs no more.

02:31.851 --> 02:34.587
This is me first day
in the house since Ricci left,

02:34.654 --> 02:36.155
and I'm feeling lonely.

02:46.733 --> 02:49.302
Having a relationship
in Geordie Shore

02:49.369 --> 02:52.772
is like having no toilet roll
when you've got diarrhoea.

02:52.839 --> 02:54.541
It' s just horrible,

02:54.607 --> 02:59.546
it never ends up how you want it
to end up and it' s always a mess.

02:59.612 --> 03:01.481
# Oh, oh, oh

03:01.548 --> 03:05.184
# Come fill my glass up
A little more... #

03:05.251 --> 03:09.789
Once again the house is
a fucking mess.

03:09.856 --> 03:14.327
It stinks, it's disgusting,
there's flies. It's horrible.

03:14.394 --> 03:16.729
Who spilt the cottage cheese
on the floor?

03:18.798 --> 03:19.799
Don't look at me.

03:19.866 --> 03:22.068
The house is a tip
cos of what you did

03:22.135 --> 03:24.771
when you came home last night.
Will you clean it?

03:24.837 --> 03:28.107
I've gone round cleaned up
all your bottles, all your cans.

03:28.174 --> 03:29.309
I'll give you a hand.

03:29.375 --> 03:31.811
Go on, then, pet.
I've done the start of it.

03:33.713 --> 03:36.983
The house is a shit hole,
I'm still feeling down.

03:37.050 --> 03:38.885
The girls need some time out.

03:39.852 --> 03:42.488
What about a little bit
of wine tasting?

03:42.555 --> 03:43.756
Go to a vine yard.

03:44.691 --> 03:45.925
Vicky's feeling down,

03:45.992 --> 03:48.928
so us girls have decided
to take her wine tasting.

03:48.995 --> 03:51.564
I'm so excited
cos I know nothing about wine.

03:51.631 --> 03:53.933
I know I'm gonna
learn loads about it.

03:58.271 --> 04:02.742
The girls' knowledge of wine
is rather limited.

04:02.809 --> 04:07.046
I know that it's made out of grapes.
It's from a leaf called vine.

04:07.113 --> 04:09.248
Or maybe a vine tree.

04:09.315 --> 04:12.418
And if it's got a map on the back,
it means it's good.

04:12.485 --> 04:14.520
This is gonna be a very long day.

04:14.587 --> 04:16.656
It's all Spanish wine.

04:16.723 --> 04:18.658
What kind is this?
Sweet? Sour?

04:18.725 --> 04:21.194
Dry.
Very dry, it's the driest one we do.

04:22.695 --> 04:25.264
How can something be dry
if it's so wet?

04:25.331 --> 04:27.200
You'll have to ask the makers.

04:27.266 --> 04:29.068
Then do you swill it like this?

04:31.237 --> 04:32.772
Then it's less calories?

04:35.174 --> 04:39.178
The girls seem completely perplexed
by this spitting out idea.

04:39.245 --> 04:41.781
You put it in your mouth,
swill it around

04:41.848 --> 04:42.982
and spit it back out.

04:43.049 --> 04:47.320
Surely enough, tasting something
is the whole swallowing part?

04:49.889 --> 04:51.924
I don't know.
I don't think I like dry.

04:54.193 --> 04:55.995
It's not mouthwash, Holly.

05:02.935 --> 05:06.906
Vicky's taste buds have gone.
She's just drinking the table dry.

05:06.973 --> 05:10.376
She's drinking my drink,
Charlotte's drink, Holly's drink.

05:10.443 --> 05:14.347
It's obvious she's missing Ricci.
She's absolutely mortal.

05:15.915 --> 05:20.019
So, come one, tell us, have I
changed your opinion of wine?

05:20.086 --> 05:24.757
No.
Still got me double vodka

05:24.824 --> 05:28.928
I'm not a wine fan.
Not even after the wine testing.

05:28.995 --> 05:31.397
But me, I've really enjoyed meself.

05:31.464 --> 05:34.467
I'm fucking mortal
and I'm gonna take a bottle home.

05:34.534 --> 05:35.535
Get in.

05:35.601 --> 05:38.004
Right, guys, beware.
They may be pranks...

05:38.071 --> 05:39.372
(laughter)

05:39.439 --> 05:43.109
Oh, no that is too funny. She stole
the fucking bottle of wine.

05:43.176 --> 05:44.610
Classy bird.

05:47.413 --> 05:50.516
# We've come a long way
Since that day

05:50.583 --> 05:53.586
# And we can never look back... #

05:53.653 --> 05:55.488
Hey.

05:56.789 --> 05:59.058
Right, you're sober.

05:59.125 --> 06:01.294
We're all going out
as one big family.

06:01.360 --> 06:05.064
Florita's. Cant wait to get pissed,
get amongst it and gan wild.

06:05.131 --> 06:06.199
(groans)

06:08.401 --> 06:10.436
Scotty fucking T doesn't drink wine.

06:10.503 --> 06:12.638
Yeah, he does. He fucking loves it.

06:20.713 --> 06:22.949
I ring Joel
and he's DJing in Newcastle

06:23.015 --> 06:25.785
and he can have a little
night out with us, too.

06:33.793 --> 06:34.894
OK, baby.

06:34.961 --> 06:39.966
I'm excited, but I just
hope he behaves heself.

06:40.967 --> 06:43.703
Joel's presence just seems to
rile everyone.

06:43.770 --> 06:46.939
Something about him
gets everyone's backs up.

06:47.006 --> 06:49.175
# I know

06:49.242 --> 06:51.010
# Caught up in the middle

06:51.077 --> 06:52.779
# I cry just a little

06:52.845 --> 06:55.481
# When I think of letting go

06:55.548 --> 06:58.251
Are you gonna fall asleep in
the club? Yeah.

06:58.317 --> 06:59.852
Are you gonna wee yourself?

06:59.919 --> 07:03.222
I would like to not do that,
but never say never.

07:03.289 --> 07:05.892
# Oh, no
Gave up on the riddle

07:05.958 --> 07:07.927
# I cry just a little

07:07.994 --> 07:10.663
# When I think of letting go #

07:20.907 --> 07:24.076
(all cheer)
We're all in Florita's,

07:24.143 --> 07:26.245
and I'm mortal from wine tasting,

07:26.312 --> 07:30.650
but that won't stop us, we're having
a couple more drinks and a laugh.

07:38.291 --> 07:39.425
Drinks are flowing,

07:39.492 --> 07:42.094
we're dancing,
everyone's getting on so well.

07:42.161 --> 07:43.329
Yay!

07:45.231 --> 07:47.133
And fucking Joel turns up.

07:47.200 --> 07:50.303
No doubt,
he'll ruin everyone's night.

07:50.369 --> 07:55.107
I have seen no real evidence
that this little, conniving man

07:55.174 --> 07:58.945
has changed his spots
in any way, shape or form.

07:59.011 --> 08:01.147
There's something fishy about it.

08:01.214 --> 08:05.184
Why is he still going on?
Is he not over me and Joel?

08:05.251 --> 08:07.486
Then we're gonna spy on Joel.

08:07.553 --> 08:10.723
Gary has now put doubts
in Sophie's mind.

08:10.790 --> 08:13.059
Buck squad kicking off.

08:13.125 --> 08:16.329
I'm starting to see
Charlotte and Gary flirting again.

08:16.395 --> 08:18.464
(screams)

08:18.531 --> 08:21.634
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

08:42.087 --> 08:45.291
So, we're all in Florita's
and Joel turns up.

08:47.627 --> 08:49.562
He looks really nice.

08:49.629 --> 08:52.164
He is a good looking lad
and I do fancy him,

08:52.231 --> 08:53.799
and I'm buzzing to see him.

09:04.210 --> 09:05.945
To me, I don't really know Joel.

09:06.012 --> 09:08.381
He's a DJ, he hangs round wherever.

09:08.447 --> 09:11.717
There's something
fishy about the whole situation.

09:11.784 --> 09:13.786
And I don't want Sophie to get hurt.

09:26.399 --> 09:28.200
Joel leaves to go and DJ.

09:28.267 --> 09:32.338
And as he's left, I can see
Holly and Gary talking about us.

09:32.405 --> 09:34.407
They're doing it
in front of me face.

09:34.473 --> 09:36.409
I wanna know what they're saying.

09:43.516 --> 09:46.185
Gary's telling me
he still doesn't trust Joel.

09:46.252 --> 09:49.622
He's just realised that
he should have never had Joel

09:49.689 --> 09:52.558
as one of the boys,
and always been on Sophie's side.

09:59.131 --> 10:03.269
Why is he still going on?
Is he not over me and Joel?

10:12.211 --> 10:16.148
Then, Charlotte comes in and goes,
"You never stick up for me."

10:24.023 --> 10:27.226
Gary's never ever stuck up
for me like that. Ever.

10:27.293 --> 10:28.327
He doesn't care.

10:28.394 --> 10:30.596
I think Charlotte's forgetting,

10:30.663 --> 10:33.366
when Dan gave her hassle,
I stuck up for her.

10:36.402 --> 10:38.871
Gary has now put doubts
in Sophie's mind.

10:47.013 --> 10:48.681
Is this a good idea?

11:02.795 --> 11:06.065
What kind of relationship is it
to spy on your boyfriend?

11:10.069 --> 11:13.305
They are about as inconspicuous
as two fucking giraffes

11:13.372 --> 11:14.407
in a red tracksuit.

11:14.473 --> 11:17.810
How on Earth is this stealth
operation gonna be pulled off

11:17.877 --> 11:19.845
with them idiots running around?

11:22.248 --> 11:25.251
So, me and Charlotte get at
the club where Joel's DJing

11:25.317 --> 11:27.920
and we try to be secret agents.
We're hiding.

11:40.399 --> 11:42.768
If Joel sees me,
he's going to kick off.

11:42.835 --> 11:46.639
He thought I was over the trust
thing, but deep down, I'm not.

11:52.878 --> 11:54.380
It must be really hard

11:54.447 --> 11:58.384
cos things have happened in the past
to make Sophie doubt Joel.

12:08.761 --> 12:12.098
We're in Florita's and I've
spotted a gorgeous blonde bird.

12:12.164 --> 12:14.500
We're having a few drinks,
she seems keen.

12:14.567 --> 12:17.636
She's gonna come back to the house
and see what happens.

12:17.703 --> 12:19.438
Gary's cracking onto some lass

12:19.505 --> 12:22.775
and he thought she was the girl
he pulled a week a go.

12:22.842 --> 12:27.279
Turns out, she's actually the girl
that Scotty pulled a week ago.

12:38.824 --> 12:40.426
Oh, my God.

12:40.493 --> 12:43.095
Biggest school boy error ever.

12:51.637 --> 12:54.740
Gary has pulled so many people
in the North East,

12:54.807 --> 12:58.110
he can no longer put names to faces
and faces to names.

13:01.313 --> 13:03.482
Scott's got a bird,
she's got a friend,

13:03.549 --> 13:07.786
that's when I come in. Straight
over there, two-minute chat, bang.

13:08.721 --> 13:13.359
We're taking these two birds home
now. Buck squad kicking off.

13:23.802 --> 13:27.773
# My name is Jamesy T
I'm on the M-I-C #

13:30.676 --> 13:33.646
We get back to the house
and fucking hell,

13:33.712 --> 13:35.014
everyone's got a bird.

13:36.949 --> 13:40.419
I would rather fucking hoy
a fucking corkscrew

13:40.486 --> 13:43.122
through me jap's eye
than go out there now.

13:43.189 --> 13:45.724
Whoa! Hey, Joel.
How you doing? You all right?

13:45.791 --> 13:47.459
I'm good.

13:47.526 --> 13:49.361
I'm lying in bed, I'm drunk,

13:49.428 --> 13:52.431
and I wake up to
my boyfriend standing there.

13:54.066 --> 13:57.703
And everyone knows, when you're
drunk, you get the twitch

13:57.770 --> 13:59.405
and you get the fanny flutter.

13:59.471 --> 14:03.209
So, me and Joel go over to
the bucking bungalow,

14:03.275 --> 14:05.678
strip down to our kegs and shag.

14:05.744 --> 14:08.814
And I am going ride him
like a rodeo.

14:10.449 --> 14:14.186
I need to get in that bedroom. Dan
starts bucking first, I cant go in.

14:14.253 --> 14:17.423
So, straight away,
get me girl upstairs, into bed.

14:17.489 --> 14:19.725
The bed situation
is just a nightmare.

14:19.792 --> 14:21.827
Joel and Sophie are in
the bungalow,

14:21.894 --> 14:25.464
Gaz is in my bedroom, all the other
rooms are taken. What do I do?

14:29.034 --> 14:30.703
Get in bed, just start banging

14:30.769 --> 14:33.405
and fucking Dan comes
barging through the door.

14:34.907 --> 14:38.010
Dan, get out. Wait outside.
I'll tell you when I'm done.

14:38.077 --> 14:39.612
I just wanted to check.

14:40.879 --> 14:43.549
Nay bother, Gary.
I'll come back soon.

14:43.616 --> 14:47.086
# Primadonna girl, yeah

14:47.152 --> 14:50.589
# All I ever wanted was the world

14:50.656 --> 14:54.260
# I can't help that I need it all

14:54.326 --> 14:56.862
# The primadonna life... #
I am missing Ricci.

14:56.929 --> 15:00.366
I'm missing him all the time and I
am having a little bit of a cry.

15:00.432 --> 15:02.067
It is getting too much for us.

15:02.134 --> 15:06.438
Funnily enough, there's no-one here
when I need them.

15:06.505 --> 15:10.209
That sounds about right.

15:29.595 --> 15:31.196
Time to wake up, Gary!

15:34.166 --> 15:36.902
Don't kick us off the bed.
Don't be nasty.

15:36.969 --> 15:39.171
Everyone knows I love
that girl to bits.

15:39.238 --> 15:42.775
When I spend time with her and we're
laughing and we're joking on

15:42.841 --> 15:47.046
and she does that little smile...
(laughs)

15:47.112 --> 15:49.615
There's no-one else
I'd rather be around.

15:59.091 --> 16:02.127
I'm starting to see Charlotte
and Gary flirting again,

16:02.194 --> 16:05.497
and I'm worried because I don't know
which way it'll go.

16:05.564 --> 16:08.867
It's just gonna end
like it always does. In tears.

16:11.670 --> 16:12.805
No!

16:15.674 --> 16:17.109
(screams)

16:23.882 --> 16:25.918
It's time for Joel
to go home again,

16:25.984 --> 16:27.886
and I do get sad to say "bye" to him

16:27.953 --> 16:30.022
cos I miss him so much
when he's gone.

16:30.089 --> 16:32.358
Right.

16:34.193 --> 16:35.894
Right, I want you to open it.

16:35.961 --> 16:38.630
Please keep your eyes closed
the whole time.

16:40.566 --> 16:41.567
Look at it

16:49.575 --> 16:53.712
Aww, that's so cute.

16:56.415 --> 16:58.717
A teddy with Joel's
voice recording in it.

16:58.784 --> 17:01.620
I think I'd rather fucking
cheese grate me nipples

17:01.687 --> 17:04.455
to listen to his voice any more,
to be honest.

17:04.522 --> 17:06.657
We're going shopping!

17:06.724 --> 17:09.494
Your fanny's in me boyfriend's face.

17:09.560 --> 17:11.530
We're going shopping!

17:11.597 --> 17:15.534
We're off shopping today, apart from
drinking and sucking people off,

17:15.601 --> 17:17.903
one of Geordie girls'
favourite things.

17:30.949 --> 17:34.219
What was going on
with you and Gary last night?

17:34.286 --> 17:37.189
I heard Gary talking about
me and Joel.

17:37.256 --> 17:39.224
And you know what I'm like.

17:39.291 --> 17:41.627
I was like,
"You've been slagging us off."

17:41.693 --> 17:45.464
And he got really defensive.
cos, apparently, he wasn't.

17:45.531 --> 17:47.533
I might have overreacted with Gary,

17:47.599 --> 17:51.236
but I just get so angry when people
get involved in my relationship

17:51.303 --> 17:53.605
because I know I'm not 100% secure.

17:53.672 --> 17:56.809
Gary was showing such
brotherly instinct towards Soph

17:56.875 --> 18:00.179
and such a paternal kind of quality
that you got jealous.

18:00.245 --> 18:03.782
I just wanted him to be a bit
like that with me, as well.

18:03.849 --> 18:06.685
If he does that to Sophie,
and they're just friends,

18:06.752 --> 18:10.322
why can't he do that to me?
Friendship bullshit.

18:18.664 --> 18:21.533
Us lads, it is important
to look good at all times.

18:21.600 --> 18:25.637
We hit the gym, go on sunbeds,
we just groom ourselves all the time.

18:25.704 --> 18:30.509
But today, we're taking it to
the extreme. Back, sack and crack.

18:30.576 --> 18:32.377
I've never had that done before.

18:32.444 --> 18:35.781
Gotta have your warrior smooth, man.
For the birds and that.

18:35.848 --> 18:37.382
"Your warrior!"

18:37.449 --> 18:40.719
I'll do it, like, if you go first.
You've gotta go first.

18:42.554 --> 18:43.589
Why not? (laughs)

18:43.655 --> 18:48.193
There's fucking no chance
I'm actually getting this done.

18:49.528 --> 18:52.130
Epic.
Epic.

18:59.805 --> 19:05.444
(laughs)
Hi. He wants his arse waxed.

19:05.511 --> 19:08.580
Oh, my God.
(laughs)

19:08.647 --> 19:09.982
We get there, walk in,

19:10.048 --> 19:14.686
I'm like, "Yep, Scott, it's fine,
sounds all good, you go first, mate."

19:14.753 --> 19:17.456
(laughs)
Listen, that's in me arsehole.

19:18.624 --> 19:21.627
I'm not gonna lie,
I'm fucking shitting meself.

19:22.594 --> 19:26.665
(screams) Epic.
(both laugh)

19:30.936 --> 19:33.338
Will it hurt, man? (moans)

19:33.405 --> 19:37.242
You know the funniest thing?
Am I fuck getting this done.

19:37.309 --> 19:39.278
You fucking are, like.

19:39.344 --> 19:41.780
I'm not. I just came to watch you.

19:41.847 --> 19:44.816
He actually fell for it
and thought I'd get that done

19:44.883 --> 19:47.719
after watching someone put
hot wax up his bum hole.

19:48.754 --> 19:52.124
Yeah, man.
I need to get some fresh air on it.

19:54.226 --> 19:55.227
(sighs)

19:59.364 --> 20:00.766
Feel how smooth it is.

20:03.635 --> 20:04.636
How smooth is it?

20:04.703 --> 20:06.638
Oh, my God.

20:06.705 --> 20:08.774
After all the drama that went on,

20:08.840 --> 20:11.276
everyone needs a night away
from this house.

20:11.343 --> 20:14.646
Right, everyone.
We've got a surprise for yous.

20:14.713 --> 20:16.848
I'm worried.

20:16.915 --> 20:19.851
For one night...
We're going out.

20:19.918 --> 20:22.120
...we are going...

20:22.187 --> 20:26.491
Camping.
(screams) I love camping.

20:26.558 --> 20:30.629
Fucking brilliant.
I've got no mirrors, no plugs,

20:30.696 --> 20:34.333
grass, mud and probably sheep.

20:34.399 --> 20:37.135
The last thing I wanna do
sit in a fucking field

20:37.202 --> 20:38.437
with loads of animals.

20:38.503 --> 20:41.373
It's a fucking load of bollocks
and I don't wanna go.

20:41.440 --> 20:43.108
Why would you wanna go camping

20:43.175 --> 20:46.945
when you can perfectly go out
in a nightclub and get pissed?

20:47.012 --> 20:50.849
She's got these little penis things
that you stick on your fanny.

20:50.916 --> 20:54.653
What is that?
Your time now.

20:56.755 --> 21:00.492
Don't mind going to work with Scott.
Something to look at.

21:00.559 --> 21:02.694
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

21:18.276 --> 21:19.544
Shoes.

21:21.413 --> 21:24.416
Scott and Gaz have decided
we're going camping.

21:24.483 --> 21:27.152
I'd rather stick pins into me face.

21:28.987 --> 21:31.123
Are you taking the fucking piss?

21:36.695 --> 21:38.330
Why would you wanna go camping

21:38.397 --> 21:40.966
when you can go out
in a club and get pissed?

21:44.770 --> 21:46.304
Ed needs to come camping

21:46.371 --> 21:50.509
because he needs to see what life
is like outside this house.

22:17.636 --> 22:20.172
Hiya. Hiya. I'm Alison.
Pleased to meet yous.

22:20.238 --> 22:22.708
James. Nice to meet you.
Hi. Nice to meet you.

22:22.774 --> 22:25.010
11.00, no noise.

22:25.077 --> 22:28.880
Any noise, I'll be coming down.

22:28.947 --> 22:30.348
11.00pm?
Yeah.

22:30.415 --> 22:33.318
We barley fucking wake up
before 11.00pm, normally.

22:33.385 --> 22:35.353
This is just a recipe for disaster.

22:38.190 --> 22:39.691
So, put that door this way.

22:45.130 --> 22:48.500
What the fuck?!
There's all rocks under the ground!

22:48.567 --> 22:51.603
Got fucking loads of room
in here, lads!

22:54.306 --> 22:58.577
Gary and Scott haven't even
erected the first compartment.

22:58.643 --> 23:02.481
That is so embarrassing.

23:02.547 --> 23:06.718
Dan and James have managed to
set their tent up canny quickly.

23:06.785 --> 23:10.222
Why can't the bucking squad
manage it?

23:10.288 --> 23:13.625
I bet if that tent was
in the shape of a girl's fairy,

23:13.692 --> 23:16.194
it would be up
and they'd be inside in no time.

23:17.429 --> 23:20.866
Hey, I thought we'd live off
the surrounding and have a bunny.

23:20.932 --> 23:23.368
No, get it away!

23:23.435 --> 23:25.837
So, I'm in the woods
and I find Roger Rabbit.

23:25.904 --> 23:29.174
He wants to say "hello" to
the girls. They're mortified.

23:29.241 --> 23:31.209
Close the door! Close it!

23:31.276 --> 23:34.679
We're gonna go Bear Grylls
on the situation. (screaming)

23:34.746 --> 23:38.884
So, Dan, being this massive
prankster what he is, comes over,

23:38.950 --> 23:43.522
thinks he's absolutely hilarious
by bringing over a dead hare.

23:43.588 --> 23:46.925
No, fuck off! Fuck right off!

23:46.992 --> 23:49.027
Char, Char, Char, he's gone.

23:57.035 --> 24:01.506
Hey! My name's Ed! Check me out!

24:04.676 --> 24:06.645
It's yous two that's gonna buck.

24:06.711 --> 24:08.346
No, it's not. Why would we...?

24:09.514 --> 24:10.549
(both laugh)

24:10.615 --> 24:12.250
Scott you're not denying it.

24:12.317 --> 24:14.219
I'm not. (laughs)

24:14.286 --> 24:16.488
The guys wont shut up
about me and Holly.

24:16.555 --> 24:19.724
If I get smashed,
I might end up blasting her.

24:19.791 --> 24:24.362
What about kissing?
Nah, we haven't actually necked on.

24:24.429 --> 24:25.764
You haven't necked on?

24:25.831 --> 24:29.467
I sucked him off for banter in
the front room in front of everyone.

24:29.534 --> 24:32.971
Yous haven't even fucking kissed?
What fucking amateurs.

24:33.038 --> 24:35.740
She's sucked him off,
she hasn't kissed him.

24:35.807 --> 24:38.476
What the hell? Get into it already.

24:40.512 --> 24:43.515
I need a wee.
Does anyone need a wee?

24:44.749 --> 24:48.053
So, since we're camping,
everyone needs to piss.

24:48.119 --> 24:51.857
And Sophie showed us that she's got
these weird little penis things

24:51.923 --> 24:53.892
that you stick on your fanny.

24:53.959 --> 24:58.964
Aim urine...
You put that on your wee hole.

24:59.030 --> 25:01.333
Do you separate the flaps?

25:01.399 --> 25:03.201
You just put that in your wee hole

25:03.268 --> 25:05.403
as if you're getting
a Chlamydia exam.

25:05.470 --> 25:08.306
You hoy it up you lulu,
you put on you wee hole

25:08.373 --> 25:09.941
and you wee into a bag.

25:10.008 --> 25:11.543
Don't!

25:21.753 --> 25:24.589
Oh, what is that?
(laughter)

25:24.656 --> 25:28.360
So, the only thing I can do, which
would be really funny

25:28.426 --> 25:31.496
is to chase the boys
with Charlotte's bag of piss.

25:31.563 --> 25:36.468
Hi, boys. It's your time now!

25:40.005 --> 25:45.510
My bag's done, I'm going to join her
and cover all the lads in my urine.

25:54.185 --> 25:57.455
Who'd have thought it?
We're making too much fucking noise

25:57.522 --> 26:01.259
and the owner comes to tell us off.

26:01.326 --> 26:05.964
She walks over to tell us off
and Charlotte's standing there

26:06.031 --> 26:08.533
with two bags of piss.

26:08.600 --> 26:10.001
Just keep the noise down.

26:10.068 --> 26:13.605
It's a campsite.
You've got children,

26:13.672 --> 26:16.107
you've got adults trying
to get some sleep.

26:16.174 --> 26:21.079
So, just keep the noise down.
Don't wanna see me angry.

26:25.483 --> 26:28.453
So, we get in the tent
and it's riddled.

26:28.520 --> 26:33.091
It's infested with flies, ants and
every creepy-crawly you can imagine.

26:33.158 --> 26:37.762
Oh, God, look at them, man.
Yous, we need to kill them.

26:37.829 --> 26:42.200
And I'm like, "Whoa, they're gonna
get inside me hair extensions."

26:42.267 --> 26:43.835
Where the hell's it gone?!

26:45.470 --> 26:49.007
Look at them man, look.
All above your head, like, flicking.

26:50.175 --> 26:51.676
All the lads are in the tent,

26:51.743 --> 26:54.479
and all we can hear
is the fucking birds screaming

26:54.546 --> 26:59.317
that there's flies in their tent.
Oh, my God! (screaming)

26:59.384 --> 27:01.319
Definitely not the outdoors type.

27:01.386 --> 27:04.255
They fucked off the tent
and went to sleep in the car.

27:04.322 --> 27:06.624
Camping is not for Geordie girls.

27:06.691 --> 27:09.894
Love you, girls.
(all) Love you. Good night.

27:29.447 --> 27:31.282
This actually looks really cosy.

27:31.349 --> 27:33.485
Horrible, man. I've had no sleep.

27:33.551 --> 27:38.990
I wake up in the car, I'm sweating,
I'm minging, I just wanna go home.

27:39.991 --> 27:43.561
We've got morning breath,
we've got Charlotte's vagina smell.

27:43.628 --> 27:46.131
I'm sure there's a bit
of piss left somewhere

27:46.197 --> 27:48.333
and we haven't left a window open.

27:58.109 --> 27:59.344
Ed!

27:59.411 --> 28:02.113
Bye, Ed.
Ed!

28:05.950 --> 28:09.287
# Everywhere we go
We feel like we are strangers... #

28:09.354 --> 28:11.856
(phone rings)

28:11.923 --> 28:15.160
We've only been home half an hour
and the phone bloody goes.

28:15.226 --> 28:17.962
You know it's Anna
Hello?

28:19.764 --> 28:21.166
Right.

28:21.232 --> 28:22.233
Right.

28:27.205 --> 28:28.273
Yeah, no bother.

28:30.408 --> 28:31.409
OK, no problem.

28:31.476 --> 28:33.144
See you, Anna. Bye.

28:36.514 --> 28:38.583
Me and you.
Oh!

28:38.650 --> 28:42.120
So, me and Scott have gotta
go massage two random people.

28:42.187 --> 28:44.489
Come on, then.
Right.

28:46.558 --> 28:50.295
And I'm not good at massages,
unless I'm using me tits or me fairy.

28:55.066 --> 28:56.367
Wait there.

28:57.669 --> 28:59.604
I don't mind going work with Scott.

28:59.671 --> 29:03.541
We have quite good banter,
get a flirt on a little bit

29:03.608 --> 29:07.545
and it's always nice to have
something to look at, isn't it?

29:07.612 --> 29:10.882
Hiya.
Hiya, you all right?

29:10.949 --> 29:13.051
Are you jealous this isn't you?

29:13.118 --> 29:15.887
(laughs) No.
I bet you'd love this.

29:15.954 --> 29:17.689
I'm giving this bird a massage,

29:17.755 --> 29:20.692
and as usual, Scotty T
is fucking lethal at it.

29:20.758 --> 29:22.894
I think Holly's getting
a bit jealous.

29:22.961 --> 29:25.930
Only cos I'm not massaging
her fucking coconuts.

29:25.997 --> 29:27.966
Remember Gaz and Charlotte?

29:28.032 --> 29:31.970
There's always gonna be something
there between them both.

29:32.036 --> 29:34.038
You were like that with James.

29:34.105 --> 29:36.541
Me and James are still
really good friends,

29:36.608 --> 29:41.479
which is good and we don't have to
have that sexual part any more.

29:46.551 --> 29:49.420
I'm all done now.
That's all right.

29:49.487 --> 29:50.488
No bother.

29:50.555 --> 29:53.291
Giving a massage wasn't
as bad as I thought.

29:53.358 --> 29:55.627
Especially not with Scott
being around.

29:55.693 --> 29:57.428
Holly is shit at massaging

29:57.495 --> 30:00.198
and we all know she's
only good at one move,

30:00.265 --> 30:02.400
and that's playing
the fucking flute.

30:04.769 --> 30:08.439
The lads are gonna get eaten alive.
Let the bidding war commence.

30:08.506 --> 30:11.242
The one time I don't mind
Holly being a cock block.

30:11.309 --> 30:14.412
20! 25!
100!

30:15.947 --> 30:18.883
I'm just missing Ricci
more and more. I'm pathetic.

30:18.950 --> 30:20.051
I'm so, so sorry.

30:21.252 --> 30:24.789
Something is there again
between me and Gary.

30:24.856 --> 30:26.891
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

30:44.776 --> 30:46.344
(phone rings)

30:53.685 --> 30:54.686
Hello.

30:55.687 --> 30:56.688
James.

31:00.291 --> 31:01.292
Right, OK.

31:04.128 --> 31:06.598
Right. Yeah, yeah, good.
No worries.

31:06.664 --> 31:08.466
See you later, Anna. Bye.
"Bye."

31:12.270 --> 31:15.139
Right, 9.00,
we all need to be ready.

31:15.206 --> 31:17.508
We're helping out
with a big auction.

31:17.575 --> 31:20.178
I said, "You're not
auctioning us, are you?"

31:20.245 --> 31:22.247
Today, we're going for an auction

31:22.313 --> 31:24.382
and none of us know
what's happening.

31:24.449 --> 31:26.517
# I'm on the floor, floor

31:26.584 --> 31:28.786
# I love to dance
So, give me more...

31:28.853 --> 31:31.889
Charlotte, you look gorgeous.
Right, ready? Let's go!

31:31.956 --> 31:33.891
# Get on the floor, floor

31:33.958 --> 31:36.094
# Like it's your last chance

31:36.160 --> 31:37.729
# If you want more, more

31:37.795 --> 31:40.031
# Then, here I am #

31:42.200 --> 31:46.537
Hello. How are you?
Glad you can make it.

31:46.604 --> 31:50.041
You need to help us raise
as much as we can for this charity.

31:50.108 --> 31:55.280
Guys, right, topless.
We need to auction you.

31:55.346 --> 31:58.049
What the fuck is this?
We're not a piece of meat.

31:58.116 --> 32:02.687
You can't give us to loads of
hungry girls for a fucking date.

32:02.754 --> 32:05.690
Vicky, my darling,
I need you to compere.

32:05.757 --> 32:08.226
Every desperate housewife
of the north east

32:08.293 --> 32:11.162
has packed themselves
into this one tiny room,

32:11.229 --> 32:13.431
hoping to get a glimpse
of a younger man.

32:16.567 --> 32:20.104
Well, if we're gonna be auctioned
off, we have to look our best.

32:20.171 --> 32:23.808
Quick pump on, give them cougars
something to fucking look at.

32:23.875 --> 32:29.380
In this room, there's, like,
100 women, all gagging for cock.

32:29.447 --> 32:33.051
And there's only four lads.
I don't know what they're gonna do.

32:33.117 --> 32:34.652
They'll get eaten alive.

32:34.719 --> 32:36.721
(applause)

32:38.589 --> 32:43.161
First up tonight, ladies,
is James "The Tank" Tindale,

32:43.227 --> 32:47.532
give him a round of applause!
(applause, cheering)

32:47.598 --> 32:50.068
James, James, James, James.

32:52.103 --> 32:53.638
Whoo!

32:55.306 --> 32:59.977
Oh, my God, ladies, that is
worth 25 fucking bean. Come on!

33:00.044 --> 33:05.249
25? 25. I hear he's really good
at licking people out.

33:07.518 --> 33:09.887
The woman in the orange has it!
Come on!

33:12.824 --> 33:14.859
(cheering)

33:14.926 --> 33:17.662
So, I've been bought
off this cougar.

33:17.729 --> 33:20.064
I don't think Kate needs to worry.

33:20.131 --> 33:23.768
Our second bachelor tonight
is Dan the Man!

33:23.835 --> 33:25.503
Come on, Dan, don't be shy!

33:25.570 --> 33:28.806
(cheering, applause)
Isn't he adorable?

33:28.873 --> 33:33.444
I've heard he shags like a dog
with two dicks. Come on, ladies.

33:33.511 --> 33:37.248
I see this woman, she's so eager.
If she wins, I'd be mortified.

33:37.315 --> 33:38.449
She'll eat us alive.

33:38.516 --> 33:44.122
Right, lasses, Gina wants him.
20. Going once, going twice.

33:44.188 --> 33:47.358
Sold to Gina for 20 quid! Get in!

33:47.425 --> 33:50.027
Come and get your prize, Gina.

33:51.763 --> 33:53.998
Whoo-hoo, tash on.

33:54.065 --> 33:57.602
Fuck it. She's paid money for
charity, I'll show her a good time.

33:57.668 --> 34:01.939
Fuck me, she's gonna annihilate him.
(laughter)

34:02.006 --> 34:03.808
He's bagged himself a pure MILF.

34:03.875 --> 34:05.543
Best bird I've seen him pull.

34:05.610 --> 34:09.045
I'd like yous to welcome
to the stage Scotty fucking T!

34:09.112 --> 34:12.116
(cheering)

34:12.183 --> 34:14.018
Scotty T is the easiest sell.

34:14.085 --> 34:16.654
His hobbies include
bucking and cleaning.

34:16.721 --> 34:20.324
I think every woman in this room
shares the same fucking hobbies.

34:20.391 --> 34:23.561
He will wine you, dine you
and sixty-fucking-nine you.

34:23.628 --> 34:26.597
Can I get...
Fuck it, I'm gonna shot a bid in.

34:26.664 --> 34:29.199
25 anyone? Come on.
50!

34:29.266 --> 34:33.404
Fucking 50 quid from the
horny redhead at the front.

34:33.471 --> 34:36.139
Holly is bidding for Scott.

34:36.206 --> 34:39.377
I think all she wants to do
is suck him off.

34:39.444 --> 34:43.414
Come on, darling! £55! Get in!

34:43.481 --> 34:45.349
75!

34:45.416 --> 34:48.886
Shit, 75 from the desperate
redhead at the front.

34:49.887 --> 34:52.824
And now there's a bidding war.
I've just got to win.

34:52.889 --> 34:54.525
100!

34:54.592 --> 34:59.363
Sold to the horny redhead.
Come and get your prize.

35:01.866 --> 35:04.469
One time I don't mind
Holly being a cock block.

35:05.670 --> 35:08.039
Can I welcome to the stage Gaz?!

35:09.106 --> 35:10.975
(cheering)

35:11.042 --> 35:14.445
I walk on stage and, fucking hell,
the place goes mental.

35:14.512 --> 35:16.280
Let the bidding war commence.

35:16.347 --> 35:18.883
Gaz can be so cocky at times.

35:18.950 --> 35:21.452
Let's just hope that
he doesn't go for much.

35:21.519 --> 35:24.889
Gary enjoys, just to wet
your appetites a bit more,

35:24.956 --> 35:27.358
nights out and bucking lasses.

35:27.425 --> 35:29.126
(laughs)

35:29.193 --> 35:31.095
£20 for this fucking stallion.

35:32.363 --> 35:37.935
20! 25! How much am I getting there?
70? £70!

35:40.071 --> 35:43.140
I've decided to bid on Gary,
just for shits and giggles.

35:43.207 --> 35:45.376
100, 100.
100!

35:45.443 --> 35:48.246
£100! Come on, girls!

35:48.312 --> 35:50.982
So, I bid and someone else
has bidded higher

35:51.048 --> 35:53.451
Who the fuck has done that?

35:55.520 --> 35:57.722
150. There's a bidding war going on.

35:57.788 --> 36:00.725
I haven't got that much money.
I can't lend you any.

36:00.791 --> 36:04.428
And then I see her.
Stupid, big blonde hair,

36:04.495 --> 36:07.999
skinny little frame,
sticking her hands in the air.

36:08.065 --> 36:11.502
Yeah, it's only
fucking Gary's stalker.

36:11.569 --> 36:14.372
I spot Natalia, who I've banged.
I was thinking,

36:14.438 --> 36:18.109
"Natalia, save us." She's one of
the fittest birds in that room.

36:18.175 --> 36:21.178
Sold to the gorgeous girls
in the corner!

36:21.245 --> 36:22.280
(cheering)

36:22.346 --> 36:25.616
Congratulations, ladies.
Come and collect your prize.

36:25.683 --> 36:30.888
She's bid a £150.
What a desperate cow.

36:30.955 --> 36:32.990
I used to bang him for free.

36:36.594 --> 36:39.163
We leave the auction
and head out for the town,

36:39.230 --> 36:42.466
but Gary is staying behind
for a date with Natalia.

36:42.533 --> 36:44.835
Charlotte is not gonna be happy.

36:48.439 --> 36:51.976
Oh, all me tassels
went down the toilet again!

37:00.051 --> 37:02.253
Come on!

37:04.655 --> 37:07.024
So, we're in Bijoux,
and for some reason,

37:07.091 --> 37:09.827
Holly's acting like
an absolute fruit loop.

37:28.546 --> 37:30.881
So, I'm just having
a bit of fun with James,

37:30.948 --> 37:33.317
saying, "You're boring now,
blah, blah."

37:37.154 --> 37:38.155
Fuck off!

37:39.490 --> 37:42.093
To be totally honest,
I don't even wanna listen

37:42.159 --> 37:45.930
what she has to say. I've moved on.
Maybe she should do the same.

37:56.207 --> 37:59.010
You can tell the fact
that Gary's on a date

37:59.076 --> 38:00.611
is bothering Charlotte.

38:00.678 --> 38:03.881
She's not enjoying herself
like she would if he was here.

38:07.451 --> 38:10.588
The word "Gaz" and "dates"
don't go in the same sentence.

38:10.655 --> 38:14.291
I don't see the point in them.
You might as well skip the bullshit,

38:14.358 --> 38:16.927
go home and just bang.

38:55.199 --> 38:57.068
Date's finished, that's me done.

38:57.134 --> 38:59.837
I'm off to meet the others
and get back on the pull.

38:59.904 --> 39:03.274
Right, have fun.
Nay tongues and shit.

39:06.077 --> 39:07.712
I'll see you tomorrow, right?

39:17.154 --> 39:18.189
Oi-oi!

39:20.591 --> 39:24.528
I can't believe Gary has come
back from his date by heself.

39:24.595 --> 39:25.763
What does this mean?

39:36.774 --> 39:39.977
Charlotte is just question
after question about the date

39:40.044 --> 39:41.946
and what happened.

39:42.012 --> 39:44.148
What the fuck?
I've only been on a date.

39:57.394 --> 40:00.197
Charlotte is really special to me,
she knows that.

40:00.264 --> 40:02.399
I don't wanna hurt her.

40:25.289 --> 40:27.024
This is so confusing.

40:27.091 --> 40:29.493
Every time I think
me and Gary have moved on,

40:29.560 --> 40:32.630
we go right back to
square fucking one.

40:45.810 --> 40:48.279
Scotty fucking T!

40:49.713 --> 40:53.317
We get back to the house
and everyone is fucking hammered.

40:53.384 --> 40:55.986
Oh, God, I'm gonna whitey.

40:56.053 --> 41:00.324
Watch your head. (laughs)
What the hell was that?

41:00.391 --> 41:03.594
Watch your tan, man, Dan.
Dan, watch your tan.

41:04.695 --> 41:08.599
Getting back to the house and I'm
just missing Ricci more and more.

41:08.666 --> 41:11.502
The feeling of loneliness I've got,

41:11.569 --> 41:14.438
even when I'm surrounded by people,
is ridiculous.

41:30.521 --> 41:32.923
I don't know how much longer
I can do this.

41:38.896 --> 41:42.800
What is my favourite colour?
Blue.

41:42.867 --> 41:45.536
No, it's never blue, Gary.
Green.

41:45.603 --> 41:49.406
Green, yes, on the fourth one.

41:49.473 --> 41:50.708
I knew more about her.

41:50.774 --> 41:52.476
Gary, what do know about us?

41:52.543 --> 41:55.212
And I haven't had a penis
inside of her.

41:55.279 --> 41:59.016
I've always though that Gary never
pays attention to anything I say

41:59.083 --> 42:00.184
or that I do.

42:00.251 --> 42:03.587
I know that you love animals.
Yes.

42:03.654 --> 42:07.858
You like watching sea documentaries.
Yeah.

42:07.925 --> 42:09.627
I know so much about her.

42:09.693 --> 42:12.529
And she's surprised by
how much attention I do pay.

42:12.596 --> 42:16.467
Your dream job is a zookeeper
and you like horses

42:16.533 --> 42:20.337
and you and your mam wanna get
stables and look after horses.

42:20.404 --> 42:24.842
He actually knows every answer.
This is really weird.

42:24.909 --> 42:26.377
I know loads about you.

42:26.443 --> 42:30.881
That was really loads.
I'm actually surprised at that.

42:36.487 --> 42:41.058
I'm a little bit tipsy and because
I know Gary knows so much about us,

42:41.125 --> 42:44.461
it's made us turn into a little bit
of a crazy, crazy person.

42:44.528 --> 42:49.533
No, no, no.
Go to bed, man.

42:49.600 --> 42:51.602
Charlotte's got in me bed.

42:51.669 --> 42:54.438
Friends don't sleep
in the same bed, Charlotte.

42:54.505 --> 42:56.440
I still wanna be a bit near him,

42:56.507 --> 43:00.477
so I'm gonna sleep on the floor
next to him to keep him company.

43:00.544 --> 43:03.147
In her head,
there's still a chance

43:03.213 --> 43:06.083
I might roll over, fall
and my cock might land on her.

43:11.155 --> 43:13.691
Something is there again
between me and Gary.

43:13.757 --> 43:16.493
The longer we spend together,
the harder it gets.

43:21.231 --> 43:24.468
It's our last day in the house,
we're gonna go out in style.

43:24.535 --> 43:26.770
To having the best month
of our lives.

43:26.837 --> 43:28.138
What the fuck?

43:28.205 --> 43:30.207
I haven't done fuck all.

43:31.642 --> 43:32.876
Fuck off!

43:32.943 --> 43:35.446
I do still have feelings for him.

43:35.512 --> 43:38.482
I'm hoping that Holly doesn't
try and grab me cock.

43:38.549 --> 43:42.052
I wanna be with me fiance
cos I miss him and cos I love him.

43:42.119 --> 43:46.223
Do you think we'll ever have sex
again? I don't understand.

43:46.290 --> 43:48.292
