WEBVTT

00:02.702 --> 00:04.128
Let's cut to the chase.

00:04.130 --> 00:06.564
If you help me save my love,

00:06.566 --> 00:09.067
you'll be celebrated in song for 100 years,

00:09.068 --> 00:10.969
and that's a promise from Galavant,

00:10.970 --> 00:12.704
the most beloved warrior
in the five kingdoms

00:12.705 --> 00:15.340
and <i> Knight Beat</i> Magazine's
Swordsman of the Year...

00:15.341 --> 00:16.843
Three times running.

00:17.577 --> 00:20.546
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you've
already given us your résumé.

00:20.547 --> 00:21.513
So...

00:21.514 --> 00:23.715
What's in this deal for us?

00:23.716 --> 00:26.451
Perhaps I have something that might help.

00:26.452 --> 00:27.419
Jewel of Valencia!

00:27.420 --> 00:28.787
Boom!

00:28.788 --> 00:30.155
Where did you get that?

00:30.156 --> 00:31.790
I smuggled it out when
we escaped from the kingdom.

00:31.791 --> 00:33.358
How? We didn't have anything with us.

00:33.359 --> 00:35.460
I swallowed it.

00:35.461 --> 00:37.029
It's huge. Believe me, I know.

00:37.030 --> 00:39.097
I had to slather it with bacon
grease to choke it down.

00:39.098 --> 00:40.666
Richard, that's insane.

00:40.667 --> 00:42.234
No, what's insane is when it came out.

00:42.235 --> 00:43.569
Do you remember that day on the ship

00:43.570 --> 00:44.970
when I was screaming for hours?

00:44.971 --> 00:47.039
Well, now I know what my mother
was always complaining about.

00:47.040 --> 00:47.873
Enough!

00:47.874 --> 00:50.842
We have a deal.

00:50.843 --> 00:53.111
I mean, rinse it off one more time...

00:53.112 --> 00:54.379
And we have a deal.

00:54.380 --> 00:55.881
Excellent.

00:55.882 --> 00:57.749
Uh, can I just say,

00:57.750 --> 01:00.519
it is so nice to negotiate
with men of honor.

01:00.520 --> 01:01.920
I mean, you outnumber us 10 to 1.

01:01.921 --> 01:03.422
You could've just as easily murdered us

01:03.423 --> 01:04.756
and kept the Jewel for yourself,

01:04.757 --> 01:08.526
but, you, sir, are a class act.

01:11.331 --> 01:12.664
Roberta, we're leaving!

01:12.665 --> 01:14.733
Grab the horses, pup-pup!

01:14.734 --> 01:16.969
Right! Uh...Pup-pup?

01:16.970 --> 01:19.271
Well, no one's called me that since...

01:19.272 --> 01:20.705
Wait a minute.

01:23.276 --> 01:26.644
Are you Roberta Steingas?

01:27.246 --> 01:28.413
I am!

01:28.414 --> 01:30.415
Oh...My...God!

01:30.416 --> 01:32.918
Bobby Steingas!
Why didn't you say something?

01:32.919 --> 01:35.320
I didn't think you'd remember me. Duck!

01:35.321 --> 01:37.823
Not remember you? Are you crazy?

01:37.824 --> 01:39.324
We grew up together, you big dummy!

01:40.526 --> 01:42.461
Galavant, you're not gonna
freakin' believe this!

01:42.462 --> 01:44.997
Our new traveling companion
is Bobby Steingas!

01:44.998 --> 01:47.332
She was one of the children my parents
used to hire to play with me!

01:47.333 --> 01:49.101
Do you think maybe
we could catch up later?!

01:49.102 --> 01:51.637
Oh, sure, she was 7 and I was 13,

01:51.638 --> 01:52.703
but it just worked, you know?

01:53.806 --> 01:55.506
Yeah, we can talk about this later.

02:01.514 --> 02:04.116
Richard, I need you to focus.

02:04.117 --> 02:06.418
Yes, it's good you smuggled
the Jewel out in your...

02:06.419 --> 02:07.953
Bottom. Well, mouth first.

02:07.954 --> 02:08.987
Wait, what?

02:08.988 --> 02:10.155
But we can't have any more mistakes.

02:10.156 --> 02:11.957
This Jewel is now our key
to getting an army.

02:11.958 --> 02:15.260
And it's Isabella's life, her salvation.

02:15.261 --> 02:17.294
How she must be suffering in Hortensia.

02:25.638 --> 02:27.039
No, no, no, no, no.

02:27.040 --> 02:30.108
Jester, it's slide, back, slide.

02:30.109 --> 02:31.276
Please get it right,

02:31.277 --> 02:33.378
otherwise my wedding dance
is gonna look so stupid.

02:33.379 --> 02:35.113
Sorry, Princess.

02:35.114 --> 02:36.782
I'm a prop comic, not a dancer.

02:36.783 --> 02:37.816
Excuse me, excuse me.

02:37.817 --> 02:38.850
Snacky time!

02:38.851 --> 02:39.984
Yay!

02:42.288 --> 02:45.656
Okay, everyone, let's take five.

02:47.994 --> 02:51.196
Milady, I hope it won't sound impertinent,

02:51.197 --> 02:53.465
but I can't help noticing the big change

02:53.466 --> 02:54.599
that's come over you lately.

02:54.600 --> 02:57.936
Oh. I guess I'm just happy.

02:57.937 --> 03:00.472
After all, I am getting married!

03:00.473 --> 03:03.375
Yeah, but your pupils
just spun 'round then,

03:03.376 --> 03:05.243
and your tiara started to glow, which...

03:05.244 --> 03:09.381
She said... She's happy, okay?

03:09.382 --> 03:10.482
Right.

03:10.483 --> 03:12.917
Let's all go back to one, shall we?

03:19.792 --> 03:22.427
Chef, no! Don't throw it away!

03:22.428 --> 03:26.698
Gwyndolin, bae, you know you
don't have to do that anymore.

03:26.699 --> 03:28.967
We are officially big-pimpin'.

03:28.968 --> 03:30.535
No more living on leftovers.

03:30.536 --> 03:33.738
We can be as wasteful as the fine folk.

03:35.708 --> 03:37.776
I don't know. It just doesn't feel right.

Gold? Diamonds?

06:05.019 --> 06:06.420
I'm going with gold.

06:06.421 --> 06:08.255
They're beautiful, My Queen.

06:08.256 --> 06:09.856
And you're sure
they don't make me look poor?

No, because they're gold.

They are the most popular queens

06:31.813 --> 06:34.081
I remember the first time I saw them.

06:34.082 --> 06:36.816
I was just a little girl, and
they passed through my village.

06:39.454 --> 06:41.121
I'd never seen anything like them.

06:41.122 --> 06:43.357
They could've bought or sold all of us

06:43.358 --> 06:46.325
with just one of their
spectacular earrings.

06:48.663 --> 06:50.097
And, to my amazement,

06:50.098 --> 06:51.732
they singled me out for special attention.

06:51.733 --> 06:53.733
Little girl, do you want a ride?

06:57.105 --> 06:59.405
Oops, sorry. Hop in!

07:02.176 --> 07:03.910
You're so poor!

07:07.982 --> 07:09.483
They sound awful.

07:09.484 --> 07:11.551
Oh, they were.

07:11.552 --> 07:14.521
And that's when I realized
I wanted to be just like them.

07:14.522 --> 07:17.624
And this invitation
to their Sunday roast proves

07:17.625 --> 07:18.924
that I've finally arrived.

07:21.929 --> 07:24.731
Hey, Gal, listen,

07:24.732 --> 07:26.967
I want to apologize again
for screwing up earlier.

07:26.968 --> 07:28.769
I was only trying to be helpful,

07:28.770 --> 07:30.904
but I promise, from now on,

07:30.905 --> 07:33.073
I'm going to do everything right.

07:33.074 --> 07:34.441
You're sitting on the map.

07:34.442 --> 07:36.275
Oh, sorry. From now on.

07:37.478 --> 07:41.381
Sorry. From <i> now</i> now on.

07:41.382 --> 07:42.416
Sorry.

07:42.417 --> 07:43.684
No need to apologize.

07:43.685 --> 07:45.585
Listen, I was thinking from here on out,

07:45.586 --> 07:48.588
maybe I'll do the hero thing...Alone.

07:48.589 --> 07:50.323
What?

07:50.324 --> 07:51.758
Why?

07:51.759 --> 07:54.828
Well, because you nearly got us
killed by those mercenaries

07:54.829 --> 07:55.962
and the mercenaries before that

07:55.963 --> 07:57.197
or any of the countless other times

07:57.198 --> 07:58.331
you've put our lives in jeopardy.

07:58.332 --> 08:01.535
But helping you is all I have right now.

08:01.536 --> 08:03.770
I mean, what else would I even do?

08:03.771 --> 08:05.706
I don't know. For argument's sake,

08:05.707 --> 08:07.641
maybe you could spend
some more time with Roberta.

08:07.642 --> 08:08.842
Hmm?

08:08.843 --> 08:11.510
I mean, you two obviously
have something going on.

08:12.547 --> 08:14.081
Me and <i> her?</i>

08:14.082 --> 08:15.348
Are you serious?

08:15.349 --> 08:17.417
No. I just said it to get out
of an awkward situation,

08:17.418 --> 08:19.920
but, actually, now that I think about it,

08:19.921 --> 08:21.088
yeah, that would be a really good way

08:21.089 --> 08:22.489
to get you out of my hair.

08:22.490 --> 08:23.557
Okay, that is officially

08:23.558 --> 08:25.692
the grossest thing I have ever heard.

08:25.693 --> 08:26.893
Me and Bobby?!

08:26.894 --> 08:28.662
I mean, we played together as children!

08:28.663 --> 08:30.731
She's like a sister!

08:30.732 --> 08:32.832
And not the kind of sister you marry.

08:32.833 --> 08:35.434
Yeah, look, I know it's hard to
see people in a different light.

08:35.436 --> 08:37.671
Unless someone comes up with
a ridiculous plan

08:37.672 --> 08:39.639
to force you together.

08:39.640 --> 08:41.640
Apropos of nothing,

08:41.642 --> 08:44.111
why don't we all go for dinner
tonight, hmm?

08:44.111 --> 08:45.912
Somewhere candlelit.

08:45.913 --> 08:46.913
Hmm.

08:46.914 --> 08:48.815
So...Anywhere?

08:48.816 --> 08:49.915
Yeah, pretty much anywhere at all.

08:54.922 --> 08:56.490
I've brought luncheon, Your Highness.

08:56.491 --> 08:57.858
Oh, just a moment.

08:57.859 --> 08:59.960
I'm practicing writing my married name.

08:59.961 --> 09:01.228
Oh.

09:01.229 --> 09:04.030
Although, isn't it exactly
the same as your current name?

09:04.031 --> 09:05.799
Yeah.

09:22.984 --> 09:24.885
Is there anything I can do to help her?

09:24.886 --> 09:27.821
You just need to let Gwynne know
how special she is.

09:27.822 --> 09:30.223
Buy her something expensive.

09:30.224 --> 09:32.658

Allow me to straighten it for you.

10:28.382 --> 10:29.549
What?

10:31.986 --> 10:34.855
Welcome, gentle lords and ladies
and especially you, friars.

10:34.856 --> 10:36.089
Thank you for letting us use your club.

10:37.391 --> 10:40.927
Today, we roast Queen Madalena,

10:40.928 --> 10:43.263
a target so easy,
it almost doesn't seem fair.

10:43.264 --> 10:45.298
I know.

10:45.299 --> 10:47.901
Now, we all know how she got her title...

10:47.902 --> 10:49.736
By killing or beheading all her exes,

10:49.737 --> 10:51.071
which just goes to show

10:51.072 --> 10:53.406
that even when
she throws them in a dungeon,

10:53.407 --> 10:55.108
she still can't keep her man!

10:56.944 --> 10:58.311
But this isn't all about

10:58.312 --> 11:01.615
what an absolutely
massive hussy Madalena is.

11:02.917 --> 11:04.117
Yeah, she is very regal.

11:04.118 --> 11:05.952
We always knew
she would end up in a castle.

11:05.953 --> 11:07.587
Yeah, we just thought she'd be cleaning it.

11:08.756 --> 11:10.690
- Okay, let's get real for a moment.
- Mm.

11:10.691 --> 11:13.593
Madalena, you have done so well.

11:13.594 --> 11:14.928
You have come from nothing,

11:14.929 --> 11:17.931
- and we are really, really proud of you.
- Mm-hmm.

11:17.932 --> 11:21.700
We think that you've turned yourself
into the queen who has everything.

11:21.702 --> 11:24.271
Except love, respect, friends...

11:24.272 --> 11:25.438
And a decent pair of earrings!

11:25.439 --> 11:26.439
Oh, yes.

11:27.875 --> 11:28.975
See?

11:28.976 --> 11:30.776
I see.

11:38.397 --> 11:41.164
That was so much fun for us.

11:41.166 --> 11:43.033
Yeah, thank you for being
so easy to make fun of.

11:43.034 --> 11:44.768
I-I loved it. I just loved it.

11:44.769 --> 11:46.303
We should definitely do this again.

11:55.580 --> 11:57.715
Of course.

12:06.024 --> 12:07.757
Gwynne?

12:09.094 --> 12:10.127
Gwyndolin?

12:10.128 --> 12:11.294
In here!

12:22.207 --> 12:23.707
What are you doing in there?

12:23.708 --> 12:25.609
You have a bed to sleep in now.

12:25.610 --> 12:28.145
Like I'm gonna sleep
in the thing people use

12:28.146 --> 12:32.283
to give birth and die in...
Sometimes simultaneously.

12:32.284 --> 12:34.151
Wow. Grim.

12:34.152 --> 12:36.720
I can't live like the fancy folk.

12:36.721 --> 12:38.455
It just isn't me.

12:38.456 --> 12:40.124
I'm never on edge anymore.

12:40.125 --> 12:41.959
I haven't had a disease for weeks.

12:41.960 --> 12:43.294
But isn't that a good thing?

12:43.295 --> 12:46.096
Maybe for some people... For you.

12:46.097 --> 12:49.033
But the thought that we're drifting apart

12:49.034 --> 12:53.037
has gotten me so down, I can
barely get out of drawer.

12:53.038 --> 12:55.305
So I think it's best if I just leave.

12:56.474 --> 12:58.542
Wait.

12:58.543 --> 13:00.109
I'll pack our things.

13:04.215 --> 13:05.215
Done.

13:05.216 --> 13:06.650
What? No.

13:06.651 --> 13:07.785
Unpack right now.

13:07.786 --> 13:09.586
You can't leave. You love it here.

13:09.587 --> 13:12.323
Gwyndolin, don't you understand?

13:12.324 --> 13:14.725
Sure, it's nice not going hungry,

13:14.726 --> 13:16.593
and my bones don't bend anymore,

13:16.594 --> 13:19.663
and my teeth don't wiggle in their sockets.

13:19.664 --> 13:22.766
I could be the king of a castle.

13:22.767 --> 13:24.802
But without you,

13:24.803 --> 13:27.171
I'd be the lowliest man in the world.

13:27.984 --> 13:30.451
Oh, Vincenzo.

13:31.309 --> 13:33.277
We leave the castle together.

13:36.448 --> 13:40.417
So, as soon as we're all seated,
you come and send for me.

13:40.418 --> 13:41.952
That looks romantic, doesn't it?

13:41.953 --> 13:44.588
Oh, Roberta! Ooh, you look smashing!

13:44.589 --> 13:46.890
Please excuse the dress.

13:46.891 --> 13:49.193
The blouse I usually wear under
it has completely disappeared.

13:49.194 --> 13:50.627
Wha... mine, too!

13:50.628 --> 13:52.396
Must be fairies. Big problem around here.

13:52.397 --> 13:53.197
Shall we sit?

13:53.198 --> 13:54.498
Oh.

13:54.499 --> 13:56.032
- You're over there.
- Okay.

13:56.935 --> 13:58.068
Uh!

13:58.069 --> 14:00.003
You're across from her.

14:00.004 --> 14:01.305
All right.

14:01.306 --> 14:03.273
- Isn't this nice?
- Mm.

14:03.274 --> 14:05.743
An urgent crow for you, sir.

14:05.744 --> 14:06.844
Oh, thank you.

14:06.845 --> 14:09.380
Unexpected.

14:09.381 --> 14:12.316
Oh. I've got to take this.

14:12.317 --> 14:13.484
Uh, you carry on without me.

14:13.485 --> 14:15.185
Here.

14:15.186 --> 14:17.154
Oh, thank you.

14:19.257 --> 14:20.524
Oh.

14:20.525 --> 14:22.893
Thank you.

14:22.894 --> 14:24.795
He's... He's a bit odd.

14:26.431 --> 14:28.699
I'm sorry. This is crazy.

14:28.700 --> 14:30.300
If you had told me a week ago

14:30.301 --> 14:32.336
that I would be sitting here
with my old pal Bobby,

14:32.337 --> 14:33.837
I'd say you've got a goblin in your head.

14:33.838 --> 14:35.239
Oh, guess what!

14:35.240 --> 14:38.108
I can still fit my entire fist in my mouth.
Do you want to see?

14:38.109 --> 14:39.810
Oh.

14:39.811 --> 14:43.447
Oh, Richard, honestly, do I
have to do everything myself?

14:43.448 --> 14:46.049
Lutes.

14:46.050 --> 14:48.051
Viols.

14:48.052 --> 14:50.087

like a good sidekick.

16:55.464 --> 16:59.545
By the way, I know
what you were up to last night.

16:59.601 --> 17:02.503
Oh, yeah. I guess it was pretty obvious.

17:02.504 --> 17:04.438
Because I sang it out loud.

17:04.439 --> 17:06.366
Hey, Bobby, I was right!

17:06.575 --> 17:08.142
Galavant <i> was</i> trying to set us up.

17:08.143 --> 17:09.344
Hilarious!

17:09.345 --> 17:11.244
- Creepy, right?
- Disgusting!

17:11.246 --> 17:12.980
- The worst!
- Yeah, all right.

17:12.981 --> 17:14.549
But, hey, at least we got that
all figured out.

17:14.550 --> 17:16.383
We know that we are just good friends.

17:17.853 --> 17:19.020
Right.

17:19.021 --> 17:21.756
Mm. So, what's next?

17:21.757 --> 17:23.825
We head to the forest.

17:23.826 --> 17:26.027
I hear there are Giants
in the Southern Reach.

17:26.028 --> 17:27.328
Perhaps we can convince them

17:27.329 --> 17:28.863
to join us in attacking Hortensia.

17:28.864 --> 17:30.631
So, we're right back where we started.

17:30.632 --> 17:33.701
Yep! Nothing has changed.

17:33.702 --> 17:35.102
Nothing.

17:37.573 --> 17:39.272
Nothing at all.
