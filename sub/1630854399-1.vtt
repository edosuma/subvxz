WEBVTT

01:38.516 --> 01:40.351
I know you ain't done yet.

01:41.602 --> 01:43.396
You say you're all used up,

01:43.479 --> 01:46.816
but I know you still
got some gold left in ya.

02:58.763 --> 03:00.806
What in tarnation...

04:04.203 --> 04:05.621
Man: Howdy, sheriff.

04:05.704 --> 04:08.290
Uh-oh! You got me.

04:08.374 --> 04:09.583
Morning.

04:14.130 --> 04:15.381
Charlotte: Daddy!

04:16.005 --> 04:20.761
Look at you, sweetheart! All
bright and shiny, like a living doll.

04:20.845 --> 04:22.096
Give us a twirl.

04:22.388 --> 04:24.890
Whoo! Is this the wedding
dress? Can I have a sneak peek?

04:24.974 --> 04:28.144
Don't be a cheat, daddy. You'll
get a full preview on our big day.

04:28.227 --> 04:29.228
Angus: Very soon now.

04:29.311 --> 04:31.147
Can you at least try
and make an effort?

04:33.482 --> 04:36.527
Angus, I see you made
the return trip as well.

04:36.610 --> 04:40.156
A wedding generally is between a
woman and a man, sheriff pulsipher.

04:40.239 --> 04:43.534
Yes it is, and I can't wait
to meet that young man.

04:43.617 --> 04:45.828
Okay, daddy.

04:45.911 --> 04:47.455
Listen to me.

04:47.538 --> 04:50.040
In five days, Angus will
be a part of this family

04:50.124 --> 04:51.500
whether you like it or not.

04:51.584 --> 04:53.335
What I'd like to see
is he's man enough

04:53.419 --> 04:55.212
to take over the reins
in protecting you.

04:55.296 --> 04:57.047
I mean, is he any good
with a barking iron?

04:57.131 --> 04:59.800
I want a husband, daddy.
Not a bodyguard.

04:59.884 --> 05:02.070
You've taught me how to take
good enough care of myself.

05:02.094 --> 05:04.847
He's taught me how to dissect
the words of dostoyevsky

05:04.930 --> 05:06.682
and he's introduced me
to dickens and poe...

05:06.765 --> 05:09.810
You're not even married yet, and
you're already meeting with lawyers?

05:09.894 --> 05:11.187
Daddy, stop it.

05:11.270 --> 05:15.441
Angus is a good soul who does
make me feel safe and secure,

05:15.524 --> 05:17.276
but most of all, happy.

05:17.693 --> 05:20.654
You're just afraid you won't be the
number one man in my life anymore.

05:21.780 --> 05:24.580
You got him well-trained, Charlotte,
that's for sure.

05:25.326 --> 05:26.368
I'm right here.

05:33.876 --> 05:34.877
Inside.

05:35.669 --> 05:37.963
Zeke: Go get 'em, boys!
Round them up!

05:38.047 --> 05:39.381
Roy: It's the Samuels.

05:43.761 --> 05:45.846
Hurry it up, ladies.
I ain't got all day.

05:45.930 --> 05:49.642
Anybody other than me comes
through those doors, you shoot 'em.

05:51.894 --> 05:52.937
Zeke: Move it, move it!

05:53.562 --> 05:54.563
Move it!

05:55.523 --> 05:57.608
Daddy? Angus.

05:57.733 --> 05:59.485
Homrhappydoes
hereahyrnakeyou? Daddy, go!

06:04.823 --> 06:06.450
You can come out now.

06:08.369 --> 06:09.870
Go, go!

06:16.961 --> 06:18.837
Move it! Man: Come on, let's go.

06:19.922 --> 06:21.173
Keep moving!

06:22.132 --> 06:24.718
Slim: First time
I made it on a poster.

06:24.802 --> 06:27.388
Hey! I'm handsome!

06:27.638 --> 06:29.473
Hands up!

06:31.433 --> 06:32.434
Come here.

06:33.811 --> 06:35.145
Stay down. Go!

07:39.043 --> 07:41.503
Don't mind. Happens to everyone.

07:41.587 --> 07:43.714
It's a crazy ride getting here.

07:45.341 --> 07:46.592
See?

07:46.675 --> 07:48.677
I just saw the most...

07:48.761 --> 07:52.139
Hano: Beautiful, bright light you
ever did see? That'd be heaven.

07:52.222 --> 07:54.183
Heading towards it is a
good sign for your future.

07:54.266 --> 07:55.809
But you haven't
made it there yet.

07:55.893 --> 07:57.436
Hold on! Hold your damn horses.

07:58.771 --> 08:00.898
Did you say heaven?

08:00.981 --> 08:02.441
I've read your file, Roy.

08:02.524 --> 08:04.151
I know everything about you

08:04.234 --> 08:05.914
and none of it says
you're hard of hearing.

08:05.986 --> 08:07.196
I'm dead?

08:07.279 --> 08:08.405
Mmm-hmm.

08:08.530 --> 08:11.158
Charlotte? What about
my daughter, Charlotte?

08:11.241 --> 08:14.036
Uh, hmm... negative.

08:14.119 --> 08:17.706
She's dead. She's dead.

08:17.790 --> 08:19.625
No, no. Negative is positive.

08:19.708 --> 08:21.168
Negative means "not dead."

08:21.293 --> 08:23.545
Negative means "not dead"?

08:23.629 --> 08:25.923
That is very confusing.
Change that.

08:27.466 --> 08:28.801
Butgood.

08:28.884 --> 08:31.178
She's got her wedding
at the end of the week.

08:31.261 --> 08:32.638
It's in two days, actually.

08:32.721 --> 08:33.806
Roy: Come again?

08:33.889 --> 08:35.683
You've been dead for three days.

08:35.765 --> 08:39.019
It takes a while for
upstairs to ratifyjudgement

08:39.102 --> 08:40.813
and send a soul
to where it belongs.

08:40.895 --> 08:42.147
You got sent to us.

08:42.940 --> 08:45.442
Welcome to the ripd.

08:45.526 --> 08:47.695
The "rip..." What?

08:47.778 --> 08:49.571
"'D.' stands for "department."

08:49.655 --> 08:51.865
The "rip" is your standard
"rest in peace."

08:51.949 --> 08:54.535
I'm the captain of the
west American division.

08:54.618 --> 08:55.911
Name's hano.

08:55.994 --> 08:59.581
See, we generally only get
soldiers, warriors and sheriffs

08:59.665 --> 09:01.583
who dearly depart
shuffled in here to us.

09:01.667 --> 09:03.544
At least the ones
deemed worthy enough

09:03.627 --> 09:07.172
to serve on god's own police force in
the ongoing fight against the deados.

09:07.256 --> 09:08.382
The what-os?

09:08.465 --> 09:09.675
The deados.

09:09.758 --> 09:12.845
Souls that escape theirjudgment
and hang around earth

09:12.928 --> 09:15.013
like the bad smell they are.

09:15.097 --> 09:17.766
Our job is to find them

09:17.850 --> 09:21.270
and send them to where
their ticket got punched.

09:22.855 --> 09:24.898
Hell, Roy. We send them to hell.

09:24.982 --> 09:27.359
Heaven and hell?

09:27.443 --> 09:29.445
Whoo!

09:31.989 --> 09:34.092
Roy: So these souls that
escape their judgement in hell

09:34.116 --> 09:35.909
are what you call "deados."

09:35.993 --> 09:38.287
Not yet. A soul,
by its very definition,

09:38.370 --> 09:39.747
is a spectral energy.

09:39.830 --> 09:41.582
Disembodied, it's ineffectual.

09:41.665 --> 09:44.710
To sow the havoc a rogue soul
desires it needs a body.

09:44.793 --> 09:46.795
Wait. A human body?

09:46.879 --> 09:48.088
Exactly.

09:48.172 --> 09:51.175
And once it takes one over,
possesses it, if you will,

09:51.258 --> 09:52.926
then it becomes a problem.

09:53.010 --> 09:56.430
Our problem. It becomes a deado.

09:56.513 --> 09:58.742
The more deados on earth, the
more unbalanced the natural order,

09:58.766 --> 09:59.846
threatening all human life.

10:00.726 --> 10:02.644
I think you're really
gonna like this.

10:06.273 --> 10:08.150
Whoo-wee.

10:08.233 --> 10:10.778
It's quite an impressive candy
store you got here.

10:14.031 --> 10:15.240
Roy: Oh, hello.

10:15.866 --> 10:17.075
Ain't you purdy.

10:22.122 --> 10:24.333
That's a very nice choice.

10:24.416 --> 10:27.836
Oh... no, no, no.
I can't be unfaithful.

10:27.920 --> 10:31.507
When it comes to what I wear
on my hip, I'm a one-gun man.

10:31.590 --> 10:34.092
Nothing comes between me
and my susie.

10:34.635 --> 10:35.969
That's my gun.

10:36.053 --> 10:37.596
I call her susie.

10:37.679 --> 10:39.681
I call her useless.

10:39.765 --> 10:41.892
Especially against deados.

10:41.975 --> 10:45.854
It'll stun them for a moment or
two, kind of like a nasty snake bite.

10:46.480 --> 10:49.191
This, however,
more than does the job.

10:49.274 --> 10:52.361
With a head shot, these bullets
can exterminate a deado's soul.

10:52.444 --> 10:53.862
And your own,

10:53.946 --> 10:56.824
should the barrel end up
being pointed in your direction.

10:56.907 --> 10:58.992
Whoa. Good to know.

11:02.204 --> 11:04.206
What's with the,
uh, hungry snake?

11:04.289 --> 11:07.626
The uroboros signifies
life, death and rebirth.

11:07.709 --> 11:10.879
Deados may look like real
humans, but after possession,

11:10.963 --> 11:13.215
that symbol is branded
on their torso.

11:13.966 --> 11:15.843
This is a reminder
to all officers

11:15.926 --> 11:17.970
of the constant threat
we're up against.

11:18.053 --> 11:19.972
Right. Cut to the chase.
Why am I here?

11:20.055 --> 11:23.267
Roy, do you remember that
total eclipse about a month ago?

11:23.350 --> 11:26.061
Well, there was an abnormal
rupture at a gateway near red creek,

11:26.144 --> 11:27.938
an old mining town in Utah.

11:28.021 --> 11:31.024
"Abnormal," because it
registered with us as a kind of

11:31.817 --> 11:33.694
hellish discharge.

11:33.777 --> 11:35.195
I know an old quack back at home

11:35.279 --> 11:38.657
who has a remedy for "hellish
discharges," if you know what I mean.

11:38.740 --> 11:40.492
Duly noted, but not
what we're looking for.

11:40.576 --> 11:43.787
You, however, know that
terrain better than most.

11:43.871 --> 11:46.748
You sign up, we'll get you
back to earth right away

11:46.832 --> 11:48.333
to check it all out.

11:48.417 --> 11:50.252
Now, that's a carrot
worth the dangle.

11:50.335 --> 11:54.089
If I get to go back to earth,
sign me up and count me in!

11:54.172 --> 11:56.592
I know what's going on
in that noggin of yours, Roy.

11:57.217 --> 11:59.303
Everyone in your position
thinks the same thing.

11:59.386 --> 12:01.763
But revenge for your murder
is not the mission.

12:01.847 --> 12:03.557
Getting to red creek is.

12:03.640 --> 12:05.601
Let sleeping dogs lie.

12:05.684 --> 12:08.604
You're a dead man. Nothing
we can do can change that.

12:08.687 --> 12:09.938
Now, before you read and sign,

12:10.022 --> 12:11.773
you should know
the standard service term...

12:11.857 --> 12:14.192
I already said I'm in.
Let's seal the deal.

12:14.276 --> 12:15.903
Oh.

12:16.111 --> 12:17.112
Send me back.

12:31.919 --> 12:34.046
You branded me
like a damn steer.

12:34.129 --> 12:35.130
Moo.

12:35.213 --> 12:38.050
Now giddy up, cowboy.
It's time to move.

12:38.133 --> 12:40.052
Oh! Watch the bread box.

12:40.135 --> 12:41.970
Sorry. People got taller
over time.

12:42.054 --> 12:44.973
We'd like to replace it but, you
know, budgetary constraints.

12:46.058 --> 12:47.476
The clock's ticking, Roy.

12:48.185 --> 12:50.520
In two days, a blood moon
will rise.

12:50.604 --> 12:53.231
And in the Bible, when that
follows a blue moon eclipse,

12:53.315 --> 12:54.900
it can only mean one thing.

12:55.442 --> 12:57.152
A hoot of a time
for astronomers?

12:58.028 --> 12:59.738
The end of times.

12:59.863 --> 13:01.281
Hmm.

13:29.518 --> 13:30.769
What the...

13:30.894 --> 13:32.813
Oh, fancy.

14:15.355 --> 14:17.232
Jeanne: That's the good thing
about dying.

14:18.567 --> 14:20.152
It can only happen once.

14:20.944 --> 14:23.071
You must be sheriff pulsipher.

14:23.155 --> 14:24.448
In all my glory.

14:24.531 --> 14:27.367
I have seen glory
and I don't think you are it.

14:29.411 --> 14:30.871
Just who might you be?

14:30.954 --> 14:31.997
Jeanne: Jeanne.

14:32.122 --> 14:33.123
The name is Jeanne.

14:33.874 --> 14:35.834
Roy: Listen, Jane,
I don't do partners.

14:35.917 --> 14:39.379
Hano charged me with looking after
you, and I don't go against orders.

14:39.463 --> 14:40.672
I don't need no looking after.

14:40.756 --> 14:42.257
And I don't need
a fourth partner.

14:42.340 --> 14:43.943
Four partners?
Where are your other three?

14:43.967 --> 14:48.263
Everywhere. The father,
son and the holy ghost.

14:50.724 --> 14:52.267
Yeah, those three gun slingers?

14:52.350 --> 14:55.437
They don't come in real handy
when you need backup in fire fight.

14:55.520 --> 14:58.774
I don't need backup with a gun
when I'm unbeatable with a sword.

15:00.108 --> 15:02.110
Let's make one thing clear.

15:02.194 --> 15:04.863
I got seniority
in this here arrangement.

15:04.946 --> 15:06.782
I got at least 20 years on ya.

15:06.865 --> 15:08.033
If we were alive.

15:08.575 --> 15:10.619
But you have been dead
for three days.

15:12.287 --> 15:14.873
162,425.

15:14.956 --> 15:17.584
Or 445 years.

15:18.168 --> 15:20.045
How senior do you feel now?

15:20.128 --> 15:22.172
Hell with this. Hee-ya!

15:28.470 --> 15:30.430
Zeke: Iain't gonna
ask you again.

15:31.473 --> 15:34.226
I said, get in line.

15:34.309 --> 15:35.894
Come on now, daddy.

15:35.977 --> 15:38.647
Bank manager: No
need to hurt me. I mean, us.

15:38.730 --> 15:40.982
I'll get you all
what I have in the safe.

15:41.066 --> 15:42.943
We ain't here for your money.

15:43.026 --> 15:45.654
This is a bank.
What else do you want?

15:45.737 --> 15:46.822
Them.

15:46.905 --> 15:50.784
Yeah, we want people. You
got any of them in your safe?

15:50.867 --> 15:52.536
'Cause, we'll take 'em all. Oh!

15:54.496 --> 15:56.414
Slim: I'm sorry about that.

15:56.498 --> 15:58.601
You're the sorriest son-of-a-bitch
we ever had the misfortune

15:58.625 --> 16:00.418
of getting stuck with.
The law is coming.

16:01.878 --> 16:04.089
God damn, they brought
the whole cavalry this time.

16:04.172 --> 16:06.383
You three stay here.
Hold them off.

16:06.466 --> 16:08.135
Catch back up with us later.
Got it.

16:11.930 --> 16:13.014
Damn it!

16:13.098 --> 16:14.474
Hee-ya!

17:21.790 --> 17:22.852
Jeanne:
You don't need a partner,

17:22.876 --> 17:24.752
and I don't need
a stray dog, Roy.

17:25.212 --> 17:26.546
Now let's go.

17:26.630 --> 17:28.550
You're not gonna stop me
from seeing my daughter.

17:28.590 --> 17:29.591
Now, listen.

17:32.719 --> 17:34.095
That was unexpected.

17:35.430 --> 17:37.390
You know,
I've never hit a woman.

17:37.474 --> 17:40.274
But you come between me and my
Charlotte, there's gonna be hell to pay.

17:46.608 --> 17:48.235
Faster than when
you were alive, huh?

18:23.520 --> 18:25.897
I can't let you go see her.

18:25.981 --> 18:27.107
Why not?

18:28.566 --> 18:29.567
Because you...

18:31.861 --> 18:33.655
Aren't you anymore.

18:59.097 --> 19:00.640
So this is me now?

19:02.142 --> 19:03.893
To everyone on earth, anyway.

19:15.280 --> 19:19.534
You always said I needed to be more
in touch with my feminine side, Millie.

19:19.659 --> 19:21.202
If you could only see me now.

19:25.623 --> 19:28.668
Breaks my heart, my daughter
will never know me again.

19:28.752 --> 19:32.922
The ripd gave you a second
chance to restore order to the world.

19:33.006 --> 19:34.716
Not your old life.

19:34.799 --> 19:37.260
That's why we don't return
as ourselves.

19:37.344 --> 19:39.888
It would be too confusing
for anyone who knew us.

19:39.971 --> 19:42.015
This is 1876 america.

19:42.098 --> 19:43.909
If you haven't noticed,
folks around these parts

19:43.933 --> 19:45.393
ain't too broad-minded.

19:45.477 --> 19:48.355
Few people are gonna talk to
us, let alone even listen to us,

19:48.438 --> 19:49.981
looking the way we do.

19:50.065 --> 19:52.525
Why do that? Make
ourjob that much harder?

19:52.609 --> 19:56.071
Maybe the eternal one thought
you could learn a thing or two.

19:56.154 --> 19:58.365
Walking in shoes of those
deemed less advantaged.

19:58.448 --> 20:00.450
Come on, now.
I have learned plenty.

20:00.533 --> 20:01.993
My best friend is black.

20:02.827 --> 20:05.372
And my daughter is a woman.

20:05.455 --> 20:07.082
Just because you know them,

20:07.165 --> 20:10.043
does not mean you understand
what it's like to be them.

20:12.128 --> 20:13.838
We'll say we're sisters.

20:13.922 --> 20:15.131
Bounty hunters.

20:16.132 --> 20:17.592
That should get us some respect.

20:18.760 --> 20:21.262
I can't believe
that this here body

20:22.013 --> 20:25.392
is right there, buried,
under my feet.

20:25.475 --> 20:26.476
Well...

20:27.852 --> 20:28.895
Well what?

20:28.978 --> 20:32.148
It's true that part of you
was buried under there.

20:32.232 --> 20:33.233
Part of me?

20:33.316 --> 20:35.902
The parts they could find.
After you were shot.

20:35.985 --> 20:39.948
I think buried here
is a foot, a shoulder,

20:40.031 --> 20:42.742
your ear, maybe, and your...

20:43.910 --> 20:45.412
My ass? Yes.

20:45.495 --> 20:47.288
They found your ass, too.

20:47.372 --> 20:48.456
Where is the rest of me?

20:48.540 --> 20:49.707
In a cave, apparently.

20:49.833 --> 20:52.585
Some coyotes got to
you, Roy. Some coyotes?

20:52.710 --> 20:54.963
They were hungry, and you
were dead. Hungry coyotes.

20:55.046 --> 20:56.631
I heard they had
some small babies.

20:56.714 --> 20:58.591
Small, hungry, baby coyotes.

20:58.675 --> 20:59.801
So, you helped them survive.

20:59.884 --> 21:01.177
It's a beautiful thing,

21:01.302 --> 21:03.012
to be a part of the
food chain. Shut up.

21:03.096 --> 21:04.536
Circle of life...
Stop. Stop talking.

21:07.267 --> 21:10.395
Where are you going, Roy?
My skin might have changed,

21:10.478 --> 21:12.078
but my heart and soul
are still the same.

21:12.105 --> 21:14.149
I know I can make
my daughter recognize me.

21:14.232 --> 21:16.943
You can't communicate with
loved ones anymore either.

21:17.735 --> 21:19.112
Anything you say to her

21:20.071 --> 21:22.782
will only come out
as an incoherent gibberish.

21:23.783 --> 21:27.537
So, not only will my daughter
not recognize me,

21:27.620 --> 21:30.248
she won't understand a lick
of what I'm saying, either?

21:31.249 --> 21:33.084
This is some bullshit.

21:36.921 --> 21:39.632
I know exactly
how you feel, ma'am.

21:39.716 --> 21:41.926
I understand your pain.

21:43.261 --> 21:44.888
It's good to let it all out.

21:45.972 --> 21:48.850
You've come to pay your respects
to the late sheriff, too, then?

21:49.559 --> 21:52.937
I can't say I've seen you
ladies around these parts before.

21:53.897 --> 21:55.482
Do you know this man?
That is Henry.

21:55.565 --> 21:56.941
My friend I was talking about.

21:57.025 --> 21:58.865
We've known each other
since we were knee-high.

22:02.155 --> 22:03.698
Name's matilde, father.

22:03.781 --> 22:08.161
And this here is my
mute sister, Mabel.

22:10.038 --> 22:11.915
We only met the sheriff once.

22:11.998 --> 22:15.126
He, uh, helped us
with our broken down wagon.

22:15.210 --> 22:19.672
I must admit, I didn't take
much of a shine to him,

22:19.756 --> 22:21.216
nor him to me.

22:21.299 --> 22:25.220
In fact, he seemed quite
self-absorbed, if you ask me.

22:26.012 --> 22:30.600
The kind of man that wanted to
control every situation he was in

22:30.683 --> 22:34.521
no matter how out of
his depth he truly was.

22:35.188 --> 22:37.732
But Mabel, well,

22:37.815 --> 22:41.277
she seemed to think he
was something really special.

22:41.361 --> 22:44.948
Well, we're all entitled to our
own points of view, I guess.

22:45.031 --> 22:49.160
But I may have to side with
miss Mabel over here on this one.

22:49.244 --> 22:51.663
That man was special.

22:51.746 --> 22:54.332
Far from perfect, of course.

22:54.415 --> 22:56.751
But, special nonetheless.

22:56.834 --> 22:59.754
I mean, was he a little
arrogant?

22:59.837 --> 23:01.089
No doubt.

23:01.839 --> 23:04.717
Did he think that
he had the answers

23:04.801 --> 23:06.886
before the questions
were even asked?

23:06.970 --> 23:10.098
That was Roy, to a tee.

23:10.557 --> 23:12.517
Pigheaded? Ha!

23:13.142 --> 23:16.062
Stubborn as an ornery mule,
more like it.

23:17.063 --> 23:18.690
Boy, was Roy loyal.

23:19.649 --> 23:24.612
To his family, this town, to me.

23:26.531 --> 23:28.950
There is no one you wanted
more to have your back.

23:29.909 --> 23:32.912
Makes me wonder how we're gonna
stand on our own two feet without him.

23:33.580 --> 23:37.250
Especially against the evil likes
of them Samuels that did Roy in

23:37.333 --> 23:39.586
and took poor
Charlotte's fiance,

23:39.669 --> 23:41.796
amongst others.

23:41.879 --> 23:44.215
Least they caught
three of them five reprobates

23:44.299 --> 23:45.842
holding up a bank today.

23:46.467 --> 23:49.095
Federal marshals will be
transferring them to laramie.

23:49.721 --> 23:52.140
It's the hangman's noose
for them boys now.

23:52.223 --> 23:54.851
Mmm-mmm. No, no. They
are moving them to laramie.

23:54.934 --> 23:57.614
They gotta pass through snake
gully and that's where we'll hit them.

23:58.896 --> 24:01.608
I have indulged
your little identity crisis.

24:01.691 --> 24:03.610
But we must get to red creek.

24:03.693 --> 24:05.194
Didn't you hear Henry?

24:05.278 --> 24:07.238
The Samuels took Angus.

24:07.322 --> 24:10.658
And that is an issue for the
earthly authorities to solve,

24:10.742 --> 24:11.951
not us.

24:12.035 --> 24:13.995
Gateways, portals, deados.

24:14.078 --> 24:16.539
That is yourjurisdiction now,
officer.

24:16.623 --> 24:17.790
Out of my way.

24:17.874 --> 24:22.045
The world could be at stake and
you care only about saving one man.

24:22.587 --> 24:24.339
Not just any man.

24:24.422 --> 24:27.967
The man that makes my daughter
the happiest in the world.

24:28.051 --> 24:29.802
And for me,
my daughter is my world.

24:29.886 --> 24:31.137
Was your world.

24:31.220 --> 24:32.597
You are dead.

24:32.680 --> 24:35.308
You'll get used to using
the past tense.

24:35.391 --> 24:37.894
Hey, Jenny, would you go
walk around on my grave?

24:37.977 --> 24:39.354
With pleasure.

24:40.480 --> 24:41.481
Wait, why?

24:41.564 --> 24:43.250
'Cause ifyou're gonna be
such a pain in my ass,

24:43.274 --> 24:44.901
you might as well
be standing on it!

24:44.984 --> 24:46.486
Goodbye, Mabel.

24:46.569 --> 24:48.237
Take good care now.

24:48.321 --> 24:50.323
Right. Mabel.

24:59.207 --> 25:00.917
Marshal: Settle down
back there, boys.

25:02.418 --> 25:03.503
Settle down.

25:10.259 --> 25:12.845
Stubborn as an ornery mule.

25:12.929 --> 25:15.223
Well, if that isn't
the understatement

25:15.306 --> 25:17.850
of my many years
of after-life service.

25:17.934 --> 25:19.977
How you feel about me is nothing

25:20.061 --> 25:23.147
compared to my disposition
for those Samuel brothers.

25:23.231 --> 25:26.234
The damndest thing,
not too long ago,

25:26.317 --> 25:28.820
those boys were good
and god-fearing.

25:28.903 --> 25:29.904
Then just like that...

25:29.987 --> 25:32.490
Bad. Turned. Rotten to the core.

25:32.573 --> 25:34.117
Old Doris Samuel said

25:34.200 --> 25:36.869
her four boys
and adopted son, slim,

25:36.953 --> 25:39.956
went out to work an old well
one day on their farm,

25:40.039 --> 25:42.417
and came back that night
a crazy bunch of no-goods.

25:42.500 --> 25:45.378
She always said it was like,
they weren't her boys no more.

25:45.461 --> 25:49.507
Also, Henry said three of
the five Samuels were caught.

25:49.590 --> 25:51.342
There should have been
only four left.

25:51.426 --> 25:53.970
I pegged their leader, Zeke,
before I was killed.

25:55.346 --> 25:57.181
Nobody could have
survived that shot.

25:57.849 --> 26:01.769
Maybe you're not the sharp shot
you thought you were, Annie oakley.

26:01.853 --> 26:05.314
I can shoot the sting
off a hornet from 50 feet.

26:06.399 --> 26:09.193
Jeanne: Your humility
is a virtue to behold.

26:09.277 --> 26:10.486
Roy: Thank you.

26:11.738 --> 26:13.030
Marshal: Hoo!

26:13.114 --> 26:14.115
Here they come.

26:15.116 --> 26:17.034
Told you they'd pass this way.

26:17.118 --> 26:18.202
Marshal: Make it quick.

26:18.536 --> 26:19.662
Now's our chance.

26:25.835 --> 26:27.420
Don't you worry none, fellas.

26:27.503 --> 26:29.756
We'll be getting you to that
judge soon enough.

26:29.839 --> 26:34.510
Just your exploits in this region
alone will see you swinging by Sunday.

26:41.642 --> 26:42.894
Sure you don't wanna go?

26:43.478 --> 26:44.645
It's a great spot.

26:48.816 --> 26:50.568
I feel light as a feather.

26:51.194 --> 26:53.362
What are you doing? We
got the element of surprise!

26:53.446 --> 26:54.447
Look.

26:54.530 --> 26:56.282
Holy shit!

26:56.365 --> 26:57.366
The uroboros!

26:57.450 --> 26:59.136
Jeanne: You may not be
such a bad shot after all, Roy.

26:59.160 --> 27:01.496
But you couldn't have killed
that which was already dead.

27:02.330 --> 27:05.958
Doris Samuels didn't think her sons
came home that night because they didn't.

27:06.042 --> 27:09.837
Rogue souls that escaped judgement
must have been hiding in that well.

27:09.921 --> 27:12.965
And possessed the brothers
and made them deados.

27:13.049 --> 27:16.761
And this just
became ourjurisdiction.

27:16.844 --> 27:20.139
Help! Help me, misters!

27:20.223 --> 27:21.557
Please.

27:22.308 --> 27:23.851
It's my sister!

27:23.935 --> 27:26.354
She's hurt real bad.

27:26.437 --> 27:28.481
She's a bit slow, you see,

27:28.564 --> 27:30.483
and doesn't have
a keen sense of direction.

27:30.566 --> 27:34.862
Fact, she don't much have a keen
sense of anything at all right now,

27:34.946 --> 27:35.947
truth be told.

27:36.531 --> 27:38.449
She slipped from the top
of the canyon.

27:38.533 --> 27:40.701
Banged herself up real good.

27:40.785 --> 27:42.095
Marshal: Now,
you hold it right there.

27:42.119 --> 27:44.372
We do not have the time
nor the disposition

27:44.455 --> 27:45.957
to help the likes of you.

27:46.040 --> 27:49.418
Guess you don't have
the disposition

27:49.502 --> 27:52.421
for no Morgan silver
then neither.

27:53.464 --> 27:54.841
Hey, fellas.

27:54.924 --> 27:56.968
See if you can help
the little lady out.

28:02.723 --> 28:04.016
Jeanne: Okay, then.

28:04.559 --> 28:05.560
Thank you.

28:06.561 --> 28:07.562
You're real saints.

28:36.549 --> 28:38.509
Marshal: Hey fellas,
we gotta go.

28:39.385 --> 28:41.429
Leave 'em to die if you have to.

28:42.471 --> 28:44.390
Just make sure
you grab the silver.

28:47.518 --> 28:48.519
Fehas?

28:55.526 --> 28:57.111
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

29:20.509 --> 29:21.844
Whoa! I got her! I got her!

29:21.928 --> 29:23.179
You go check!

29:28.935 --> 29:30.269
Yeah, you got her.

29:31.020 --> 29:32.271
That's for damn sure.

29:36.859 --> 29:38.486
But I can't see no bullet hole.

29:40.029 --> 29:41.405
Boo!

29:41.822 --> 29:43.074
Jeanne: Hey, marshal.

29:43.157 --> 29:45.284
Still want that silver?

29:46.202 --> 29:49.246
Roy: That's the thing about
dying, it can only happen once.

29:50.039 --> 29:52.625
Ow. Just like a snake bite.

29:58.172 --> 30:00.007
Damn strong lock.

30:04.345 --> 30:07.223
Search him again!

30:07.306 --> 30:09.433
I'm telling you,
the key must have got lost

30:09.517 --> 30:12.895
while you were busy assaulting
us us federal marshals.

30:15.439 --> 30:18.275
No! These ain't mine! Oh, god!

30:19.110 --> 30:20.194
So what now?

30:23.948 --> 30:25.491
We're gonna have
to pop one of them.

30:26.409 --> 30:27.410
Pop what now?

30:30.413 --> 30:33.290
Roy: You gonna partake in a
little moonshine with our captives?

30:33.374 --> 30:34.875
This isn't moonshine.

30:35.376 --> 30:38.504
But for deados,
something far more torturous.

31:16.709 --> 31:19.086
Once popped,
he's got to be stopped.

31:28.888 --> 31:30.014
What the...

31:37.146 --> 31:38.981
Holy shit.

31:39.440 --> 31:41.192
No, water.

31:41.275 --> 31:42.902
Blessed by the almighty.

31:42.985 --> 31:46.822
Once they've possessed a human,
deados hate revealing their true selves.

31:46.906 --> 31:48.824
The pain is unbearable.

31:48.908 --> 31:51.368
Holy water speeds up
the process.

31:51.452 --> 31:53.871
Uh, where are the other two?

31:54.789 --> 31:55.998
Oh, there's one.

31:59.376 --> 32:00.544
Jeanne: Like I said,

32:00.628 --> 32:03.130
in a gunfight,
all I need is my sword.

32:03.631 --> 32:05.299
Let's go, deado filth.

32:19.313 --> 32:20.481
Son of a...

32:20.564 --> 32:21.899
What?

32:21.982 --> 32:24.860
What? Don't you
"what, what" me, boy.

32:24.944 --> 32:27.279
You was the one that sent me
to the bone orchard

32:27.363 --> 32:30.157
with a slug to the back
of the skull, ya damn coward!

32:30.241 --> 32:32.535
Ma'am! I've no idea who you are!

32:32.618 --> 32:34.578
He doesn't recognize you,
roycephus.

32:35.538 --> 32:37.224
Roycephus?
Her name is roycephus?

32:37.248 --> 32:38.374
Oh!

32:38.457 --> 32:39.959
I saw it on your tombstone.

32:40.042 --> 32:41.919
It is a pretty funny name.
Is it Roman?

32:42.002 --> 32:44.797
It means noble and kind!

32:44.880 --> 32:46.924
Neither of which
I'm feeling at the moment,

32:47.007 --> 32:49.176
as I stare into the eyes
of my murderer.

32:49.260 --> 32:50.469
No! Whoa, whoa. Slow down!

32:50.553 --> 32:53.347
Now I know sheriff pulsipher
was shot near the train that day,

32:53.430 --> 32:54.723
but I've no idea who did it.

32:54.807 --> 32:55.850
You did it!

32:55.933 --> 32:58.519
It was you! You shot
me from inside the train!

32:59.061 --> 33:00.688
Nah, that bill
is a load of bosh.

33:00.771 --> 33:01.931
Someone's trying to frame me!

33:02.356 --> 33:03.357
Okay.

33:03.440 --> 33:06.360
Cool, cool, so clearly,
you can't see our true selves.

33:06.443 --> 33:08.028
But can you see these weapons?

33:08.112 --> 33:09.196
Mmm-hmm. Yeah, I see them.

33:09.280 --> 33:13.325
Good, 'cause this pistol is the
last thing you're ever gonna see!

33:13.409 --> 33:14.702
Adios, deados!

33:14.785 --> 33:17.121
No. What about
getting him to talk?

33:17.204 --> 33:19.748
Think about your daughter.
About Angus.

33:19.832 --> 33:21.500
They're the reason
we're here, right?

33:22.459 --> 33:23.711
God damn it!

33:27.464 --> 33:29.304
What did you do with
the people from the train?

33:29.383 --> 33:30.384
Eat a horn toad!

33:34.388 --> 33:35.931
Mmm-hmm. Oh, boy.

33:55.075 --> 33:56.577
Come on out!

33:56.660 --> 33:57.995
Any more, and he'll pop.

33:58.078 --> 34:00.122
I'll talk. Please!

34:11.132 --> 34:12.509
Roy: Go on, then. Talk.

34:13.302 --> 34:15.471
Slim: Okay. Okay, okay.
There's this deado.

34:15.554 --> 34:18.181
The worst I've ever seen.
Goes by the name Otis.

34:18.264 --> 34:21.976
Otis claiborne.
And he ain't like most deados.

34:22.061 --> 34:23.478
He's more powerful.

34:23.562 --> 34:26.690
He forced me and the souls
that took over the other Samuels

34:26.774 --> 34:29.777
to kidnap people
and deliver them to red creek.

34:29.860 --> 34:32.487
Red creek? As in
red creek, Utah?

34:32.571 --> 34:33.822
Slim: Yeah.

34:34.406 --> 34:37.952
Maybe this little diversion
wasn't a waste of time, after all.

34:38.577 --> 34:41.413
And how long you been
rounding up folks for this Otis'?

34:41.496 --> 34:43.958
About a month.
Since he showed up.

34:44.041 --> 34:46.793
That's around the same time
as the gateway rupture.

34:46.877 --> 34:51.005
You reckon this Otis could be the
"hellish discharge" hano was on about?

34:51.090 --> 34:53.259
Souls can escape
on their way into hell

34:53.342 --> 34:55.344
but none have ever
gotten back out.

34:55.427 --> 34:58.264
What business does this Otis
have with the kidnapped folk?

34:58.347 --> 35:00.349
He's locking them up.
Keeping them healthy.

35:00.432 --> 35:02.726
He's got something
big planned. That's for sure.

35:02.810 --> 35:05.312
And it's goin' down soon.
That's all I know!

35:05.396 --> 35:07.273
Means Angus
might still be alive.

35:07.898 --> 35:11.527
Look, we was just trying
to lay low from you ripd.

35:11.610 --> 35:15.406
But Otis has a real
scary way about him.

35:15.489 --> 35:17.408
I ain't proud of what I done,

35:17.491 --> 35:20.953
but he threatened to wipe
us all out if we didn't help.

35:21.036 --> 35:23.580
And how exactly
was he going to do that?

35:23.664 --> 35:25.958
Deados can't wipe out
other deados.

35:28.252 --> 35:29.586
With one of those, they can.

35:30.504 --> 35:35.050
Now why would this Otis fella
have himself an ripd equalizer?

35:35.134 --> 35:38.262
I don't know. But it's not good.

35:39.305 --> 35:40.723
We need to get to red creek.

36:15.758 --> 36:18.260
That deado crew has returned.

36:19.261 --> 36:21.055
But they only brought back
eight more.

36:23.015 --> 36:26.685
I'll get them to do one
last run before midnight.

36:26.769 --> 36:30.481
Their leader said they're
done. For good this time.

36:30.564 --> 36:34.151
Seems they want out before
any ripd start moving in.

36:34.610 --> 36:36.111
Isthatso?

36:37.696 --> 36:39.239
What else did he say?

36:39.323 --> 36:42.743
He doesn't think we should all
be following you with such...

36:43.369 --> 36:44.620
Blind faith.

36:45.621 --> 36:47.498
They are questioning
your origins.

36:48.540 --> 36:49.958
Who you say you really are.

36:51.043 --> 36:52.252
And you?

36:52.336 --> 36:55.089
Do you doubt who I say I am?

36:57.216 --> 36:58.384
It's just...

37:00.135 --> 37:02.096
They're questioning
how you got out.

37:21.323 --> 37:23.575
As one of the three,
I had the freedom

37:23.659 --> 37:25.744
to roam all circles
of the underworld.

37:26.829 --> 37:29.998
I escaped through limbo
during that full moon eclipse

37:30.082 --> 37:32.334
when a fragment of
the gateway grew weak.

37:34.044 --> 37:38.132
Now, tonight's blood moon
completes a tetradic lunar cycle,

37:38.215 --> 37:42.177
making the entire gateway
weak and vulnerable at midnight.

37:44.680 --> 37:47.433
That's when we put
the humans to work.

37:48.684 --> 37:50.686
It gives them six hours to toil

37:50.769 --> 37:53.272
until the gateway strengthens
again at dawn,

37:53.355 --> 37:56.567
making it impossible
to penetrate once more.

37:57.943 --> 38:01.113
This is why we need
as many hands as we can get.

38:02.614 --> 38:04.074
Because if they fail...

38:05.033 --> 38:06.869
It will be another
quarter of a century

38:06.952 --> 38:10.164
before the gateway
is at its weakest once again.

38:13.375 --> 38:16.962
I was tired of fighting
for control down below.

38:18.213 --> 38:21.341
I escaped to rule over my
own dominion here on earth.

38:21.425 --> 38:24.803
I can barely wait a few hours,
let alone a quarter of a century.

38:27.556 --> 38:28.765
Now you tell me.

38:31.768 --> 38:34.813
Do I also have to fight for
your belief in me as well?

38:36.190 --> 38:37.191
No, I'm with you.

38:38.525 --> 38:39.526
I am.

38:40.360 --> 38:42.362
I believe you can deliver us
hell on earth.

38:43.071 --> 38:44.072
But...

38:44.156 --> 38:45.324
But what?

38:46.033 --> 38:48.118
I can no longer speak
for the others.

38:49.703 --> 38:52.623
Well, let's go open
everyone's eyes, then.

38:53.999 --> 38:55.584
If you're gonna put faith in me,

38:55.667 --> 38:57.753
inolonger want it to be blind.

38:59.379 --> 39:01.006
Hmm.

39:08.639 --> 39:12.518
Roy: Are you sure we can't just pop
this dead weight? He's holding us back.

39:12.601 --> 39:15.145
Jeanne:
Execution is not ripd policy.

39:15.229 --> 39:17.773
Once we're done, hano will
have him redirected back to hell.

39:17.856 --> 39:19.566
His fate has already
been sealed.

39:19.650 --> 39:22.528
Just put me on the back
of the horse, miss horciphus.

39:22.611 --> 39:24.112
We'll get there much quicker.

39:24.196 --> 39:26.490
I'll hold on to you
real tight. I promise.

39:26.573 --> 39:31.119
We'll keep each other nice and toasty,
huh? What do you say?

39:31.370 --> 39:34.164
Roy: I'll give him a fighting
chance. Ten seconds start.

39:34.248 --> 39:35.874
He did kill me, after all.

39:35.958 --> 39:39.336
Jeanne: "The best revenge is to
be unlike him who caused the injury."

39:39.795 --> 39:41.672
Roy: You quoting
the Bible on me now?

39:41.755 --> 39:44.049
Jeanne: No.
Marcus aurelius said that.

39:44.132 --> 39:46.468
Like you, he was a Roman, too.

39:46.552 --> 39:49.763
Roycephus ain't Roman.
It's a family name.

39:49.846 --> 39:52.599
Jeanne: Okay. I got it.
Message received.

39:52.683 --> 39:55.769
Don't you mean "Roy-ceiphed"?
Message "Roy-ceiphed."

39:55.852 --> 39:58.939
Get it? 'Cause
your name is royceph...

40:01.066 --> 40:02.901
Oh! Here come the snake bites.
Snake what?

40:02.985 --> 40:05.070
Ow! Ow!

40:06.446 --> 40:08.282
I'm sorry, okay? Damn!

40:11.702 --> 40:14.496
I'm gonna file a complaint
when you take me in.

40:16.748 --> 40:18.417
Speaking of fate,
I gotta thank you.

40:19.209 --> 40:23.213
For, uh, saving my life
back at the canyon.

40:24.256 --> 40:25.674
He had me dead to rights.

40:26.425 --> 40:28.635
That wasn't easy for you,
was it?

40:29.219 --> 40:31.972
Admitting you can't do it alone.

40:32.055 --> 40:34.450
I'm not admitting anything, I'm just
saying thanks for having my back.

40:34.474 --> 40:35.475
Don't make this awkward.

40:35.559 --> 40:36.560
You're welcome.

40:36.643 --> 40:38.645
But it wasn't your life
that I saved back there.

40:39.771 --> 40:41.565
But something
far more important.

40:42.858 --> 40:43.859
Your soul.

40:46.194 --> 40:48.822
So tell me,
your dearly departed Millie,

40:48.905 --> 40:50.991
do you think she ended
"up" or "down"?

40:51.533 --> 40:54.161
Well seeing how I was
heading to the pearly gates,

40:54.244 --> 40:57.831
that damn fine woman probably
has a seat in the front row.

40:57.914 --> 40:58.957
Hmm.

40:59.082 --> 41:00.667
Looking forward to joining her.

41:02.085 --> 41:04.087
Hopefully,
she is waiting for you.

41:05.672 --> 41:07.257
Oh, hey!

41:08.592 --> 41:11.178
What's that now? Oh, nothing.

41:12.179 --> 41:13.764
It's just... it's just what?

41:13.847 --> 41:17.726
It's just there are
a lot of good men in heaven.

41:17.809 --> 41:18.935
Very good men.

41:19.645 --> 41:21.688
Good looking, so I hear.

41:22.397 --> 41:24.399
Maybe she moved on.

41:24.941 --> 41:26.109
They can do that?

41:26.193 --> 41:27.235
Yeah.

41:28.362 --> 41:29.905
Roy and slim: Damn!

41:33.575 --> 41:35.118
I thought when I died,

41:35.202 --> 41:38.288
Millie and I would be
together for eternity.

41:38.538 --> 41:41.041
Eternity?
Together with you, Roy?

41:41.124 --> 41:42.834
No, no, no, no.

41:42.918 --> 41:46.380
That would be more like hell
for poor Millie. Don't you think?

41:46.463 --> 41:47.881
Yeah, it would. It would.

41:48.006 --> 41:50.759
What are you laughing at? What?

41:50.842 --> 41:52.969
I'm just breaking your noix.

41:53.053 --> 41:54.054
Breaking my what?

41:54.137 --> 41:55.972
Your, uh, this, only for boys.

41:56.598 --> 41:57.933
Breaking my nuts? Yes.

41:58.058 --> 42:00.102
You were breaking my
nuts? Uh-huh.

42:01.228 --> 42:02.688
Yes! That was a good one.

42:02.771 --> 42:03.897
Oh, you got me.

42:03.980 --> 42:05.023
I got you. Yeah.

42:05.107 --> 42:07.067
You got me, too.
Man, she's funny.

42:07.150 --> 42:09.152
Weird, but funny.

42:09.528 --> 42:11.446
I'll shut up now.
Message Roy-ceiphed.

42:12.698 --> 42:14.533
I mean received. Aw, shit.

42:15.534 --> 42:17.202
Ow!

42:47.858 --> 42:50.277
I heard this was all
you could muster.

42:51.153 --> 42:53.447
Zeke: Word's getting around
about our kidnappings,

42:53.530 --> 42:55.949
so it's rare to find anybody
gathering around here at all.

42:57.409 --> 43:00.036
Our last two scores
had to be over the border.

43:00.746 --> 43:03.915
Like I said,
we're done here now.

43:11.047 --> 43:14.176
You really don't wanna stay
and be a part of the foundation

43:14.259 --> 43:16.136
that creates a new world order?

43:16.970 --> 43:21.183
You don't wanna witness
something truly biblical?

43:32.277 --> 43:35.113
What a shame
you have no faith in me.

43:35.864 --> 43:38.992
Because when I lead our kind
in earth's great takeover,

43:39.075 --> 43:43.038
you could have had
a seat at the main table.

43:59.054 --> 44:00.388
Look at me!

44:00.472 --> 44:02.015
Open your eyes.

44:02.098 --> 44:05.477
I said, open your eyes!

44:10.232 --> 44:11.817
And believe!

44:25.121 --> 44:27.332
How do you feel about staying?

44:30.627 --> 44:31.837
Go help the others.

44:33.713 --> 44:37.175
I want these new ones
masked up, watered and fed.

44:37.634 --> 44:39.803
I need them all fit
for the work ahead.

44:58.280 --> 45:01.491
You think anyone
doubts who I am now?

45:08.164 --> 45:11.418
Let's play a game called
"when we were alive."

45:12.252 --> 45:15.630
So, when you were alive,
what'd you prefer?

45:15.714 --> 45:18.383
Whiskey or gin?

45:18.466 --> 45:20.385
Dresses or tights?

45:20.468 --> 45:22.137
Chicken or steak?

45:23.346 --> 45:24.347
You know what to do.

45:25.056 --> 45:26.057
Come again?

45:33.273 --> 45:35.567
It's actually starting
to tickle.

45:35.692 --> 45:36.693
Damn it!

45:37.652 --> 45:39.905
The waltz or tango?

45:41.531 --> 45:43.533
Coffee or tea?

45:43.617 --> 45:45.577
Saloons or brothels?

45:45.660 --> 45:48.997
Sunrise or sunset?

45:50.081 --> 45:52.417
Long hair, short hair?

45:52.500 --> 45:54.544
Missionary or doggy-style?

45:54.628 --> 45:56.421
Oh! Ah!

45:56.588 --> 45:58.173
I'm starting to like that.

45:59.174 --> 46:00.342
Are we there yet?

46:03.887 --> 46:05.972
Jeanne: "The sun
will turn into darkness,

46:06.056 --> 46:07.265
"and the moon into blood,

46:07.349 --> 46:09.351
"before the great
and terrible day comes."

46:09.434 --> 46:11.478
Roy: Guessing that's not
Marcus aurelius?

46:11.561 --> 46:12.771
Jeanne: The book ofjoel.

46:12.854 --> 46:15.565
The sentiment is echoed in
acts and revelations, signifying...

46:15.649 --> 46:16.959
The beginning
of the end of times?

46:16.983 --> 46:19.903
Yeah, hano sent me back to
earth with that same cheery note.

46:19.986 --> 46:21.947
Just over that Ridge
is red creek.

46:22.822 --> 46:24.658
I'd turn back if I were you.

46:26.451 --> 46:27.869
Here are the rules.

46:27.953 --> 46:31.831
You open that rancid piehole of yours
and you tell anyone who we really are,

46:31.915 --> 46:33.959
mmm-hmm. You eat
one of these bullets.

46:34.042 --> 46:37.253
You even imply
that we're ripd...

46:37.337 --> 46:38.838
You eat one of these
here bullets.

46:38.964 --> 46:45.095
In fact you speak without me
allowing you to speak...

46:45.178 --> 46:46.805
I eat one of them there bullets?

46:46.888 --> 46:49.015
You're not as dumb as you look.

46:56.356 --> 46:58.817
You so damn ugly.

47:00.276 --> 47:01.277
Good idea.

47:01.361 --> 47:03.488
We don't want anyone
recognizing we have him.

47:03.571 --> 47:05.991
Yeah. That's why I did it.

47:07.951 --> 47:09.619
Slim: What's that smell?

47:25.844 --> 47:28.763
Two black women are pulling
a hooded man through town

47:28.847 --> 47:30.724
with a rope and no one
bats an eyelid?

47:33.935 --> 47:36.855
They seem too ill
to notice anything.

47:36.938 --> 47:38.606
Yeah, I wonder
what's ailing them.

47:39.441 --> 47:41.651
Cholera hit Blackpool
a few months back.

47:49.784 --> 47:50.869
You hear that?

47:51.911 --> 47:54.164
Jeanne: I hear nothing. Exactly.

47:54.789 --> 47:58.168
Just when you think things
couldn't get any stranger...

48:00.378 --> 48:03.798
An empty saloon. Whatever
happened here, happened in a hurry.

48:06.718 --> 48:08.845
Boys, where is everyone?

48:12.766 --> 48:14.726
That's right! Pile it all up.

48:14.809 --> 48:17.228
Come on, keep it moving now.
Come on. There you go.

48:17.312 --> 48:20.148
All your donations are
going to a damn fine cause,

48:20.231 --> 48:21.399
I assure you, so...

48:21.483 --> 48:23.818
Keep those heads up and
have another blessed Eve...

48:23.943 --> 48:26.823
Who's the snake oil salesman? Julius:
In the good lord's favorite town!

48:27.280 --> 48:30.200
Slim: Ah, Julius butterfield.
He owns the saloon,

48:30.283 --> 48:33.828
livery stables, general store, the
local printing press and the hotel.

48:34.079 --> 48:35.914
Oh, yeah. He's also the mayor.

48:35.997 --> 48:37.248
Seems like a fair election.

48:42.879 --> 48:45.507
- Julius: Okay, I got you.
- I got you.

48:46.424 --> 48:48.051
Forgive my tardiness.

48:48.134 --> 48:51.221
There are days I need at least
five of me to get all I need...

48:52.388 --> 48:53.389
._done.

48:56.142 --> 48:57.393
Oh, no, no, no.

48:57.477 --> 48:58.520
You...

48:58.728 --> 49:00.897
You're gonna have to leave.
You should not be in here.

49:00.980 --> 49:02.482
Sure, we should!

49:03.525 --> 49:05.110
We're bounty hunters.

49:05.235 --> 49:08.696
Sisters. All the way
from bandera, Texas.

49:09.364 --> 49:12.617
We require lodgings.
And this is a hotel.

49:13.785 --> 49:14.786
He your bounty then?

49:16.329 --> 49:17.872
You're not as dumb as you look.

49:19.165 --> 49:20.458
Well, maybe you both are...

49:21.209 --> 49:23.044
Because it appears
that you can't read.

49:26.756 --> 49:27.924
Now leave.

49:28.591 --> 49:29.926
You're breaking the law.

49:30.635 --> 49:32.846
Just 'cause it's a law,
don't make it right.

49:33.429 --> 49:35.014
I'm gonna ask you
to take that down.

49:36.891 --> 49:38.643
Just as soon
as I get that chance.

49:48.653 --> 49:49.654
Burn it.

49:50.697 --> 49:52.490
You don't tell me what to do.

49:55.952 --> 49:56.953
Now.

49:59.164 --> 50:00.165
Right.

50:01.708 --> 50:02.709
You're right.

50:03.668 --> 50:05.712
Capitalism is colorblind.

50:05.795 --> 50:08.298
And being more open means
making more money, after all.

50:09.549 --> 50:10.550
Thank you.

50:12.468 --> 50:13.469
All right.

50:32.739 --> 50:33.823
You all right?

50:45.251 --> 50:46.252
Bevedy!

50:50.215 --> 50:51.216
Yes, sir!

50:52.967 --> 50:55.011
What's all that "sir" nonsense?

50:55.345 --> 50:58.973
I told you it's just plain old
"Julius" to you and everyone else.

50:59.057 --> 51:01.184
We're all one and the same
around here.

51:02.894 --> 51:05.563
Now, Beverly would you
please be so kind

51:05.647 --> 51:09.400
as to show our guests here
to room 5?

51:12.862 --> 51:13.988
Thank you.

51:15.323 --> 51:16.574
Enjoy your stay.

51:19.452 --> 51:20.787
Follow me, ladies.

51:26.209 --> 51:30.672
Pardon my asking, but I recognize
the birthmark on the arm of your bounty.

51:30.755 --> 51:33.841
He and his posse have been in
and out of town a few times of late.

51:33.925 --> 51:35.718
Mind if I enquire
what you got him for?

51:35.802 --> 51:37.345
Killing a us marshal.

51:37.428 --> 51:40.181
Slim: I told you, I
ain't kill no...

51:40.265 --> 51:41.933
But don't you worry none,
miss Beverly.

51:42.016 --> 51:43.851
We're gonna keep a
real close eye on him.

51:43.935 --> 51:45.561
I ain't afraid of him.

51:45.645 --> 51:49.983
His partners were plain nasty.
But he was, uh, nice.

51:50.066 --> 51:51.234
Slim: Yes, thank you.

51:51.317 --> 51:52.485
Come on in.

51:57.407 --> 51:59.617
I hope it has everything
you need.

52:02.161 --> 52:05.707
Jeanne: Excuse my own
inquisitiveness,

52:06.708 --> 52:08.251
miss Beverly,

52:08.334 --> 52:12.088
but what ails the town?

52:16.467 --> 52:17.885
No one knows for sure.

52:18.678 --> 52:20.096
Started about a month ago.

52:20.722 --> 52:23.766
Mr. Butterfield says it has
to do with the water supply.

52:23.850 --> 52:26.519
But between you and me
and the bedpost,

52:26.602 --> 52:29.897
I think that's just a ploy
for him to sell more whiskey.

52:30.315 --> 52:31.607
To who?

52:31.691 --> 52:33.318
There ain't barely
anyone around.

52:33.526 --> 52:36.612
Oh. Town emptied out
dead of last night.

52:37.488 --> 52:40.658
Mr. Butterfield says gold
was struck not far away.

52:41.284 --> 52:44.996
Seems everyone must want a
piece before there's nothing left.

52:46.331 --> 52:49.143
If that was the case, I reckon old
butterfield would have been the first

52:49.167 --> 52:50.418
to break ground.

52:51.210 --> 52:52.879
Do you really believe him?

52:54.797 --> 52:56.174
I don't have much of a choice.

52:57.175 --> 52:58.176
Pardon me.

53:02.138 --> 53:03.538
I suggest you keep
your door locked.

53:07.268 --> 53:09.395
Slim: You heard her.
She said I'm nice.

53:09.479 --> 53:10.938
She ain't well.

53:11.022 --> 53:12.774
Confusing you with someone else.

53:12.857 --> 53:15.151
I mean, can a deado be nice?

53:15.234 --> 53:17.195
Not in my extended expenence.

53:17.278 --> 53:19.739
Slim: Well, look who's
discriminating now.

53:19.822 --> 53:22.992
There must be something in
the air making everybody sick.

53:23.076 --> 53:26.371
That's why it's not affecting any
of us. In other words, the dead.

53:26.454 --> 53:28.081
And I think...

53:30.583 --> 53:32.043
It's coming from up there.

53:32.126 --> 53:33.294
Slim: Hmm? Up where?

53:42.804 --> 53:44.555
Girl: Daddy! Daddy!

53:48.559 --> 53:51.229
Stay with me! Stay with me!

53:53.481 --> 53:55.233
Don't, don't! Don't, don't!

53:55.316 --> 53:57.527
Please! I've got
to revive my daddy.

53:57.610 --> 53:59.529
Please... no, no, no.

54:00.655 --> 54:03.866
Look, he's still with us.
Just let him rest.

54:04.909 --> 54:08.287
Listen, lady. Up here, if you
take off that mask, you will die.

54:08.371 --> 54:09.539
And fast.

54:09.622 --> 54:11.040
How do you know?

54:12.792 --> 54:13.918
I've seen it happen.

54:31.477 --> 54:34.897
Girl: Okay! Stop it!
You've made your point.

54:36.399 --> 54:37.525
Okay!

54:49.745 --> 54:51.330
What do they want with us all?

54:51.831 --> 54:52.832
I don't know.

54:53.583 --> 54:56.002
I have a feeling that we'll
come to understand real soon.

54:56.586 --> 54:58.296
Man: What are you looking at?

55:36.751 --> 55:37.877
God damn it!

55:42.757 --> 55:45.301
Otis: You gotta get all the
equipment up to the mine.

55:46.177 --> 55:47.720
There's no time to waste.

55:47.803 --> 55:50.723
We start opening the gateway
in less than an hour.

55:57.647 --> 55:59.148
What do you want, butterfield?

55:59.232 --> 56:01.234
Listen. Otis.

56:01.317 --> 56:03.736
I've done everything
asked of me so far, haventl?

56:04.403 --> 56:07.657
You did try and run away from
me a few days ago, remember?

56:07.740 --> 56:10.451
Okay, okay, but since then,

56:10.535 --> 56:13.037
I couldn't have been more
accommodating to your needs,

56:13.120 --> 56:16.249
no matter how felonious
or demanding.

56:18.042 --> 56:19.043
But, please.

56:19.377 --> 56:20.795
I'm begging you.

56:21.128 --> 56:24.173
All I want in return
is one of these.

56:28.344 --> 56:30.221
I told you they're
for workers only.

56:31.639 --> 56:33.474
Are you gonna be one?

56:33.558 --> 56:35.726
I told you, I got a town to run.

56:35.810 --> 56:37.395
You don't have much of one left.

56:37.478 --> 56:38.980
Because you've taken everyone!

56:39.063 --> 56:40.439
No! Please!

56:44.944 --> 56:46.362
No, no, no. Please.

56:48.155 --> 56:50.425
Please! A couple of healthy
ones just checked into the hotel.

56:50.449 --> 56:51.951
Take them, too.

56:52.034 --> 56:54.245
Just give me a mask.

56:55.329 --> 56:56.831
I don't wanna die.

56:56.914 --> 56:59.417
Death is not so bad.

57:01.294 --> 57:06.007
In fact, sometimes it's the
beginning of a whole new kind of life.

57:06.716 --> 57:08.092
I mean, look at us,

57:08.175 --> 57:13.347
we can breathe all kinds of toxic
air that you can't in your current form.

57:20.521 --> 57:23.983
And didn't I promise your body
the same sort of rebirth

57:24.066 --> 57:28.404
if you just showed us a little
cooperation and hospitality?

57:28.487 --> 57:29.655
And I have.

57:30.573 --> 57:31.907
I've done everything.

57:31.991 --> 57:34.910
I just... I just want
my town back.

57:36.662 --> 57:39.540
Tomorrow is the dawn
of a new day for you.

57:42.126 --> 57:44.462
And all mankind.

57:45.921 --> 57:47.006
Go on.

57:47.298 --> 57:48.299
Take it.

57:50.051 --> 57:51.260
It's yours.

58:05.775 --> 58:08.152
What are you all even doing
up that mountain anyways?

58:08.736 --> 58:12.782
Well now that you have that
mask on, you're gonna find out.

58:16.243 --> 58:17.828
Julius: Otis, please!

58:18.788 --> 58:19.872
Otis!

58:20.581 --> 58:21.916
Otis! Man: Get back.

58:24.627 --> 58:27.922
Ugh. Damn! Smelt like a
horse's ding-dong under there

58:28.005 --> 58:29.085
you would know. Where is...

58:29.131 --> 58:31.425
Otis keeping the kidnappees?

58:31.509 --> 58:33.928
We delivered them to the
church. That's all I know. Promise.

58:35.888 --> 58:38.015
Ow. What are you doing?
I can help!

58:38.099 --> 58:40.226
Nice try hoss.
You're staying put.

58:40.309 --> 58:42.395
You got looser lips
than a jawless mule.

58:42.478 --> 58:44.188
You're gonna stay right here.

58:44.271 --> 58:45.356
Come on!

58:45.439 --> 58:48.651
That is tight as a bull's ass
in fly season.

58:48.734 --> 58:51.570
Look, give me a chance
to prove myself!

58:51.654 --> 58:53.739
Please. I don't wanna
go to hell.

58:53.823 --> 58:55.825
Nothing we can do
about that now.

58:56.575 --> 58:58.869
I didn't do nothing that bad
when I was alive.

58:58.953 --> 59:00.413
Clearly, you did enough.

59:00.496 --> 59:03.416
I mean, I stole some stuff.

59:03.499 --> 59:04.583
Just some?

59:04.667 --> 59:06.544
Okay, a little more than some.

59:08.337 --> 59:10.172
A lot. I stole a lot of stuff.

59:10.256 --> 59:11.716
In fact, I was called "bumble,"

59:11.799 --> 59:14.510
on account of my hands were
stickier than a beehive. See?

59:15.761 --> 59:17.805
Hey! That's my new susie!

59:20.224 --> 59:22.101
You call your gun "susie"?

59:22.810 --> 59:25.062
Yeah, named it after
my dear old meemaw.

59:25.146 --> 59:28.190
You named a soul killer after your
grandma and I'm the twisted one?

59:28.274 --> 59:31.110
You should be going to hell,
not... my point is,

59:31.193 --> 59:33.904
I could have blown both
your souls to dustjust now.

59:33.988 --> 59:35.156
But I didn't.

59:36.198 --> 59:38.951
'Cause I want you to know
you can trust me.

59:39.660 --> 59:42.371
Stealing ain't right,
I know that.

59:42.913 --> 59:44.623
But it ain't nothing
compared to them souls

59:44.707 --> 59:46.584
that took over
the other Samuel boys.

59:46.667 --> 59:50.296
You heard Beverly, them deados
are meaner than out snakes.

59:50.379 --> 59:51.797
And I ain't like them.

59:52.256 --> 59:56.844
You think it's fair that we all getjudged
to end up in the same awful place?

01:00:03.851 --> 01:00:05.478
Psst, psst.

01:00:06.604 --> 01:00:07.605
What is it?

01:00:07.688 --> 01:00:10.274
Is there a chance that
old slim, the real slim,

01:00:10.357 --> 01:00:12.485
a little part of him
is still in there?

01:00:12.568 --> 01:00:15.070
No. Slim is long gone.

01:00:15.154 --> 01:00:17.698
This "bumble" soul
is in complete control now.

01:00:17.782 --> 01:00:19.575
And he's playing you, Roy.

01:00:20.367 --> 01:00:22.953
Deados will do anything
to avoid going to hell.

01:00:23.746 --> 01:00:24.997
Don't be fooled.

01:00:25.956 --> 01:00:26.957
Now let's go.

01:00:30.586 --> 01:00:33.047
Slim: I don't wanna go
to hell. I don't belong there!

01:00:33.130 --> 01:00:36.217
Please! Let me prove it to
you. I can prove it to you, please.

01:00:36.300 --> 01:00:38.761
I said, let's go, Roy.
Slim: Please!

01:00:40.095 --> 01:00:43.307
Please! Please come back!

01:00:43.974 --> 01:00:45.893
I don't wanna go to hell!

01:00:47.353 --> 01:00:49.980
Please! I don't belong there!

01:00:59.824 --> 01:01:02.660
Jeanne:
God have mercy on their souls.

01:01:05.246 --> 01:01:06.247
Sorry.

01:01:06.789 --> 01:01:09.917
The desecration of a house
of god is the ultimate sin.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.168
Ultimate?

01:01:11.252 --> 01:01:15.756
Kidnapping, hurting children, murder,
tad bit higher, but to each their own.

01:01:17.716 --> 01:01:19.969
At least we know
slim was telling the truth.

01:01:20.052 --> 01:01:22.930
Angus was here. He was wearing
this the day he was taken.

01:01:23.722 --> 01:01:25.558
Man: Help me somebody!

01:01:25.933 --> 01:01:28.811
Help me, please! Anybody!

01:01:28.894 --> 01:01:32.273
Is anybody there? Please!
Anybody, help...

01:01:33.357 --> 01:01:34.358
Butterfield?

01:01:37.862 --> 01:01:39.530
What the hell
are you doing in there?

01:01:39.613 --> 01:01:41.574
This guy Otis
and his bunch of madmen!

01:01:41.657 --> 01:01:43.117
They've seized my entire town,

01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:45.470
just rode right in here, threw
me in the back of this Van...

01:01:45.494 --> 01:01:47.413
Slow down! Where'd
they take everyone?

01:01:48.038 --> 01:01:49.039
Up the mountain.

01:01:49.874 --> 01:01:51.792
But the only thing up
there is an old mine.

01:01:52.167 --> 01:01:53.887
Ain't no one struck it lucky
up there for...

01:01:53.919 --> 01:01:55.087
Yeah. The gateway!

01:01:55.170 --> 01:01:58.632
I did hear Otis say something
about "opening a gateway."

01:01:58.716 --> 01:02:01.927
The poisonous gas in the air
is seeping through the gateway

01:02:02.011 --> 01:02:03.762
from the depths of hell.

01:02:03.846 --> 01:02:06.557
That rupture
was Otis's soul escaping.

01:02:08.517 --> 01:02:10.603
Oh, lord. Why are you praying?

01:02:12.354 --> 01:02:15.608
Otis is going to use the humans
to crack the whole thing wide open.

01:02:15.691 --> 01:02:17.735
Why, so he can
get back inside? No.

01:02:17.818 --> 01:02:20.321
So he can let the souls
of the damned back out.

01:02:20.779 --> 01:02:22.448
Roy. Roy?

01:02:22.531 --> 01:02:25.993
Jeanne: Otis is going to use those
digging humans and turn them into deados.

01:02:26.076 --> 01:02:28.829
After that,
they'll keep pouring out,

01:02:28.913 --> 01:02:31.123
eventually taking over and...

01:02:31.206 --> 01:02:33.334
Possessing the rest
of the world.

01:02:33.876 --> 01:02:35.920
I get it. End of times.

01:02:36.503 --> 01:02:37.838
Mmm-hmm.

01:02:38.005 --> 01:02:41.383
But why doesn't Otis and his deado
troop just do the digging themselves?

01:02:41.467 --> 01:02:44.595
Like us, they're unaffected by the gas
and stronger than the humans, right?

01:02:44.678 --> 01:02:50.184
God created a defense, a kind
of buffer between earth and hell

01:02:50.267 --> 01:02:52.353
to stop the souls beneath
from returning.

01:02:53.228 --> 01:02:55.439
That buffer was all of humanity.

01:02:55.940 --> 01:03:00.402
Only when they invite the souls
back in are they able to rise again.

01:03:00.486 --> 01:03:01.766
Roy: But that
would never happen.

01:03:01.862 --> 01:03:05.282
'Cause mankind would never
welcome pure evil back into their world.

01:03:05.366 --> 01:03:07.493
But by digging
through the gateway,

01:03:08.661 --> 01:03:10.287
that's exactly
what they're doing.

01:03:16.710 --> 01:03:22.841
Okay, you just lost me with all
that talk of hell and "souls escaping."

01:03:24.301 --> 01:03:26.512
You women can be
so overly dramatic.

01:03:26.595 --> 01:03:29.974
Really? Well, clearly
you don't want "us women"...

01:03:30.057 --> 01:03:31.725
To save your ass?

01:03:32.601 --> 01:03:34.311
No!

01:03:34.395 --> 01:03:35.437
Fine, just do it yourself!

01:03:46.532 --> 01:03:47.533
A little help!

01:03:55.874 --> 01:03:56.875
Roy: A little help!

01:03:59.086 --> 01:04:00.713
A little more help! I'm trying.

01:04:03.799 --> 01:04:04.925
Here! Take it.

01:04:35.706 --> 01:04:37.207
Mr. Butterfield!

01:04:38.208 --> 01:04:40.502
I have your tea
and nightcap for you.

01:04:43.589 --> 01:04:44.882
Mr. Butterfield, sir?

01:05:37.017 --> 01:05:39.311
"Butterfield printing press"?

01:05:39.812 --> 01:05:41.063
"500 copies"?

01:06:05.879 --> 01:06:08.215
You didn't kill no lawman.

01:06:09.216 --> 01:06:11.468
You're a victim
of a gross injustice.

01:06:15.639 --> 01:06:16.640
No way.

01:06:17.766 --> 01:06:18.767
Now go.

01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:20.727
Before they come back.

01:06:43.125 --> 01:06:44.626
I think I'm dying.

01:06:47.337 --> 01:06:49.006
I know something that may help.

01:06:58.515 --> 01:07:00.726
Get these to the folks
who are still around.

01:07:00.809 --> 01:07:02.186
Can you help me?

01:07:02.269 --> 01:07:04.688
I've got some place else
I need to be.

01:07:25.250 --> 01:07:27.187
Nell: You guys ready?
Cooper: Yeah. All set, ma'am.

01:07:27.211 --> 01:07:28.337
It's almost midnight.

01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:33.425
Not much longer now.

01:07:35.302 --> 01:07:36.511
Hey, hey!

01:07:36.595 --> 01:07:37.846
Back from the door!

01:07:41.475 --> 01:07:42.476
Hey.

01:07:43.977 --> 01:07:45.103
I know that sword.

01:07:46.063 --> 01:07:49.149
Yeah. We bagged
ourselves some ripd.

01:08:06.124 --> 01:08:07.376
Don't take your eyes off them.

01:08:09.586 --> 01:08:12.506
It looked like she recognized
you and could see me.

01:08:12.589 --> 01:08:17.176
Yup. Now we know where those
deados got their ripd weapons.

01:08:17.761 --> 01:08:19.011
That's Nell boyce.

01:08:19.095 --> 01:08:21.473
Recruitment got
that one all wrong.

01:08:21.555 --> 01:08:23.850
She robbed our armory
before going into hiding.

01:08:23.934 --> 01:08:25.774
Guess she found something
worth coming out for.

01:09:03.849 --> 01:09:06.018
Roy: You got some stones
on you, boy.

01:09:06.100 --> 01:09:09.395
But sometimes, saving
the day requires you to admit

01:09:09.479 --> 01:09:11.023
you can't do it alone.

01:09:11.732 --> 01:09:12.733
Angus: Whoa.

01:09:14.484 --> 01:09:16.028
You should better
get some masks.

01:09:16.611 --> 01:09:18.738
You're gonna croak real
fast up in here if you don't.

01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:21.283
Angus?

01:09:22.158 --> 01:09:24.202
I'm sorry, do I know you, ma'am?

01:09:24.286 --> 01:09:25.703
Of course you do, son.
It's me...

01:09:25.787 --> 01:09:27.413
Ro...

01:09:28.457 --> 01:09:29.457
Right.

01:09:31.084 --> 01:09:32.669
No, uh...

01:09:33.879 --> 01:09:35.881
No, you, uh, don't know me.

01:09:35.964 --> 01:09:37.256
No, um...

01:09:37.341 --> 01:09:39.885
I, uh, just heard...

01:09:39.968 --> 01:09:42.386
Your name called out by somebody

01:09:42.470 --> 01:09:45.265
when you were storming
out of the cage

01:09:45.349 --> 01:09:47.350
like a wild mustang.

01:09:47.434 --> 01:09:49.102
"Careful, Angus!

01:09:49.185 --> 01:09:51.813
"Don't do anything foolish,
Angus. And so on."

01:09:51.897 --> 01:09:53.939
That doesn't matter right
now. What matters is...

01:09:54.524 --> 01:09:56.610
I see you now.

01:09:56.693 --> 01:10:00.155
And you got much more moxie
than I ever gave you credit for.

01:10:02.449 --> 01:10:06.161
I've been wrong to judge you
unkindly since we met.

01:10:07.037 --> 01:10:10.332
Which was, what,
maybe a minute ago?

01:10:10.832 --> 01:10:11.833
Miss...

01:10:12.292 --> 01:10:13.460
Mabel.

01:10:14.169 --> 01:10:15.504
The name's Mabel.

01:10:16.713 --> 01:10:18.173
Are you married, Angus?

01:10:18.715 --> 01:10:20.217
Angus: No, ma'am.

01:10:21.468 --> 01:10:22.469
But I'm engaged.

01:10:23.428 --> 01:10:25.972
To the most wondrous human
that I've ever met.

01:10:26.390 --> 01:10:27.516
And her father?

01:10:27.599 --> 01:10:29.267
Handsome son of a bitch,
ain't he?

01:10:29.351 --> 01:10:31.686
What? I mean... I guess?

01:10:31.770 --> 01:10:33.397
Not a guessing game,
I'm sure he is.

01:10:35.399 --> 01:10:39.152
You know, I just never understood
why he never took a shine to me.

01:10:39.236 --> 01:10:45.283
Maybe he stupidly thought that
you marrying my... his daughter...

01:10:45.367 --> 01:10:47.285
You were trying to replace him.

01:10:47.953 --> 01:10:48.954
And you know...

01:10:50.080 --> 01:10:54.418
What, with his poor wife taken
ill by the pox a few years earlier...

01:10:55.961 --> 01:11:00.715
Maybe he was scared
he'd be left all alone.

01:11:01.049 --> 01:11:02.050
Wow.

01:11:03.635 --> 01:11:06.680
How could you possibly
know all that?

01:11:08.306 --> 01:11:09.307
It's a gift.

01:11:10.976 --> 01:11:13.478
Some call it women's intuition.

01:11:13.562 --> 01:11:15.230
Let me ask you something.

01:11:15.772 --> 01:11:19.484
If he was standing right here, right
now, what would you say to him?

01:11:20.110 --> 01:11:23.447
Well, I would say, "Roy..."

01:11:23.530 --> 01:11:24.781
"You handsome son-of-a-bitch,"

01:11:24.865 --> 01:11:27.075
start with flattery,
helps with future in-laws.

01:11:27.367 --> 01:11:29.744
Angus: Um... so I'd say, "Roy...

01:11:31.788 --> 01:11:35.208
"Not only do I think
that you are...

01:11:35.333 --> 01:11:39.504
A handsome son-of-a-bitch." Angus:
A handsome son-of-a-bitch, but...

01:11:39.588 --> 01:11:43.508
"I just want you to know that I
could never compete with you.

01:11:43.592 --> 01:11:46.887
"And I just hope you know
how much I respect you.

01:11:48.847 --> 01:11:51.475
"If I can ever be half the
husband for my Charlotte

01:11:51.558 --> 01:11:53.643
"that you've been
a father, then I...

01:11:53.727 --> 01:11:56.146
"I'll die knowing
that I got it right."

01:11:59.608 --> 01:12:02.402
You're gonna get that chance,
I promise you.

01:12:06.990 --> 01:12:07.991
For inspiration.

01:12:11.786 --> 01:12:13.330
I told you, I got a gift.

01:12:13.413 --> 01:12:15.624
Otherworldly, you might say.

01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:27.969
Here we go.

01:12:41.399 --> 01:12:42.651
It's time.

01:12:43.652 --> 01:12:45.987
Gateway is weaker
than I thought.

01:12:47.906 --> 01:12:50.325
They'll break through
sooner than expected.

01:12:50.408 --> 01:12:52.035
Bring 'em all in.

01:12:52.869 --> 01:12:55.455
What do you want to do
about the ripd?

01:12:58.250 --> 01:13:00.126
Otis: I got plans for them.

01:13:12.847 --> 01:13:14.808
Mabel! Mabel!

01:13:15.475 --> 01:13:16.560
Help!

01:13:17.769 --> 01:13:20.939
You stay down. You stay
calm. Think of Charlotte!

01:13:23.733 --> 01:13:24.818
Let me go with him.

01:13:24.901 --> 01:13:25.902
Let me go with him!

01:13:25.986 --> 01:13:27.487
We wanna go in! We wanna help!

01:13:27.571 --> 01:13:28.572
Nell: I bet you do.

01:13:30.198 --> 01:13:31.783
Ripd scum.

01:13:31.866 --> 01:13:34.536
Hey, Joan, been a long time.

01:13:35.537 --> 01:13:37.664
Still got this famous
blade of yours.

01:13:38.915 --> 01:13:43.044
As ex-ripd, I can tell you
what these two really look like.

01:13:45.422 --> 01:13:47.215
I can see them.

01:13:50.427 --> 01:13:52.887
I can see everything.

01:13:53.763 --> 01:13:56.016
And I can tell you
it's too late for you

01:13:56.099 --> 01:13:58.101
and your department, I'm afraid.

01:13:58.977 --> 01:14:03.064
Tomorrow your ripd will be
useless against our numbers.

01:14:04.190 --> 01:14:08.320
When the gateway opens wide,
deados will take over.

01:14:09.112 --> 01:14:11.823
And I'm gonna rule over
them all as I turn earth

01:14:11.906 --> 01:14:15.910
into the tenth circle of hell.

01:14:18.079 --> 01:14:19.247
Ah!

01:14:19.748 --> 01:14:21.708
Just before dawn,
bring them in so that

01:14:21.791 --> 01:14:23.376
I can throw them into the abyss

01:14:23.460 --> 01:14:26.129
before the gateway
closes once again.

01:14:34.596 --> 01:14:37.682
And for someone who
hates fire as much as you,

01:14:38.475 --> 01:14:39.768
Jeanne d'Arc,

01:14:40.435 --> 01:14:42.812
you'll be bathing in it
for all eternity.

01:14:45.357 --> 01:14:46.858
Nell: Whoa-ho.

01:14:48.234 --> 01:14:52.697
The irony
is so gloriously delicious.

01:14:55.992 --> 01:14:57.911
Do not let them
out of your sight.

01:15:07.796 --> 01:15:10.382
Jeanne d'Arc? Joan?

01:15:10.465 --> 01:15:12.676
445 years dead?

01:15:12.759 --> 01:15:15.095
I think pretty quick on
my feet. I figured it out.

01:15:15.178 --> 01:15:17.097
You're... Joan ofarc.

01:15:17.180 --> 01:15:18.348
Wow.

01:15:19.015 --> 01:15:20.016
Joan.

01:15:20.725 --> 01:15:23.561
If it's all right with you, I'm just
gonna keep calling you Jean.

01:15:23.645 --> 01:15:26.106
Jeanne. Jean, Jeanne, samethmg.

01:15:27.065 --> 01:15:30.860
Joan ofarc, first partner this
lone wolf has ever really needed.

01:15:32.112 --> 01:15:35.156
And I've enjoyed having you
as my fourth partner.

01:15:36.658 --> 01:15:37.659
Roycephus.

01:15:37.742 --> 01:15:40.954
Well, let's hope those
other three are really with us,

01:15:41.037 --> 01:15:42.997
'cause we're gonna need
all the help we can muster

01:15:43.039 --> 01:15:44.165
to get the hell out of here.

01:15:51.506 --> 01:15:53.174
Nell: Harder. Dig harder.

01:15:57.804 --> 01:15:58.847
Get him up.

01:15:58.972 --> 01:16:01.725
Deado: Get up. Angus:
No, no, no. Please, I can help.

01:16:01.808 --> 01:16:03.810
Come on. Deado: Back to work!

01:16:24.998 --> 01:16:27.292
I can feel it now.

01:16:30.628 --> 01:16:32.422
In three...

01:16:32.922 --> 01:16:34.132
Two...

01:16:35.925 --> 01:16:36.968
One.

01:17:38.071 --> 01:17:41.115
Roy: So if they can get
this gateway open,

01:17:41.199 --> 01:17:43.493
is there anything
that can close it?

01:17:43.576 --> 01:17:47.539
Yes. Butwe'll need
to extinguish the hellfire.

01:17:48.206 --> 01:17:50.250
Only one thing can do that.

01:17:50.917 --> 01:17:53.711
During the siege of Orleans,
when I was alive,

01:17:54.712 --> 01:17:58.049
I broke ranks to assess the
damage done to our houses of god...

01:17:58.716 --> 01:18:00.885
God, have mercy on their souls.

01:18:03.721 --> 01:18:06.599
I discovered something
truly magnificent.

01:18:10.270 --> 01:18:12.230
The tears of Christ.

01:18:13.106 --> 01:18:16.025
Slim: Hey, y'all. Room
for one more at this party?

01:18:16.109 --> 01:18:19.028
Well, well, well. Look
what the cat dragged in.

01:18:19.112 --> 01:18:20.530
Didn't think we'd see you again.

01:18:20.613 --> 01:18:22.657
Shut up, Cooper.
You talk too much.

01:18:23.908 --> 01:18:27.662
Mm. How does it feel being
on the "royceiphing" end?

01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:30.665
Oh, that's hers, ain't it?

01:18:31.457 --> 01:18:32.876
Yeah.

01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:35.086
It's big.

01:18:37.380 --> 01:18:39.257
Cooper: Whoa. Take it easy.

01:18:39.340 --> 01:18:41.175
Not after the way
she's treated me.

01:18:41.259 --> 01:18:42.886
This is not
what's planned for her.

01:18:42.969 --> 01:18:44.679
You don't wanna
go against orders.

01:18:46.931 --> 01:18:48.308
Well, how about her, then?

01:18:48.391 --> 01:18:50.476
Ireahyfeelhke shooting somebody.

01:18:50.810 --> 01:18:52.020
I get that.

01:18:52.812 --> 01:18:54.147
Oh, you do?

01:18:54.564 --> 01:18:55.815
Well, that's great!

01:19:22.300 --> 01:19:24.844
Well, do you trust me now?

01:19:27.013 --> 01:19:28.264
So before I let you out,

01:19:28.348 --> 01:19:31.267
I want you to promise me,
my soul gets a retrial.

01:19:31.351 --> 01:19:33.478
I want my current
judgement revoked.

01:19:33.561 --> 01:19:37.023
That's rare, but not impossible.

01:19:37.106 --> 01:19:39.776
You let us out,
and I'll see to it.

01:19:42.820 --> 01:19:43.821
And you.

01:19:45.615 --> 01:19:47.617
Before I let you out,
you need to see this.

01:19:49.619 --> 01:19:51.704
Remember, butterfield
owns a printing press,

01:19:51.788 --> 01:19:53.289
and like I said, I was framed.

01:19:53.831 --> 01:19:55.458
I told you the bills
weren't official.

01:19:55.541 --> 01:19:57.251
Butterfield had
them fake ones made.

01:19:57.710 --> 01:20:00.421
Your beef is with him,
not me, roycephus.

01:20:02.590 --> 01:20:03.591
Call me Roy.

01:20:23.194 --> 01:20:25.475
All right, listen to me. We
gotta try and get out of here.

01:20:26.447 --> 01:20:28.282
We gotta get out right now! No!

01:20:28.366 --> 01:20:30.451
Daddy! No!

01:20:32.203 --> 01:20:33.204
Please...

01:20:39.460 --> 01:20:41.838
He's gone! He's been
taken! Look at me!

01:20:41.921 --> 01:20:43.840
Your daddy's gone.
We have to go!

01:20:49.262 --> 01:20:51.806
These tears need to be dropped
into the eye of the hellfire,

01:20:51.889 --> 01:20:53.141
dead center in the gateway.

01:20:53.224 --> 01:20:55.435
Only then will it seal,
sucking everything in with it.

01:20:55.518 --> 01:20:57.158
Means we gotta get
those humans out first.

01:20:57.603 --> 01:20:58.604
Exactly.

01:20:59.564 --> 01:21:00.565
Now go.

01:21:01.149 --> 01:21:02.483
Uh, you're coming with.

01:21:02.567 --> 01:21:05.111
Ican't, Roy. I... I just can't.

01:21:06.154 --> 01:21:07.321
Go! Go!

01:21:10.700 --> 01:21:13.995
Just stay with me. You'll
get out. Just stay with me.

01:21:25.006 --> 01:21:26.591
Come on! I think I get it!

01:21:29.010 --> 01:21:30.595
Don't look at them!

01:21:30.678 --> 01:21:32.680
Avert your eyes!

01:21:32.764 --> 01:21:34.223
Avert your eyes!

01:21:35.475 --> 01:21:38.495
You've got fire in you that's greater
than anything that ever came out of hell.

01:21:38.519 --> 01:21:40.104
You got this. Come on, now!

01:21:40.188 --> 01:21:42.356
Not a moment has passed
since I was burned at the stake

01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:44.567
that I have not heard
my own dying screams.

01:21:46.652 --> 01:21:47.862
I can't do fire, Roy.

01:21:48.738 --> 01:21:49.739
I'm sorry.

01:21:50.156 --> 01:21:51.199
Bring me in.

01:21:54.535 --> 01:21:55.578
Hey, partner.

01:21:56.329 --> 01:22:00.083
You've been safeguarding
these for 445 years.

01:22:00.833 --> 01:22:02.168
This is your moment.

01:22:10.093 --> 01:22:12.720
Make them open their eyes!

01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:18.643
Make them look!

01:22:28.528 --> 01:22:29.904
I didn't call forthem.

01:22:29.987 --> 01:22:31.614
No choice,
the other one rebelled.

01:22:31.697 --> 01:22:33.699
Took out Cooper and Brooks
before I got her.

01:22:33.783 --> 01:22:34.968
What should I do with this one?

01:22:34.992 --> 01:22:36.119
Just throw him in!

01:22:42.750 --> 01:22:44.627
Ready? Mmnpmnm.

01:22:44.710 --> 01:22:45.711
Set. Mmm-hmm.

01:23:01.769 --> 01:23:03.437
Angus: This way. Come on.

01:23:03.896 --> 01:23:04.897
Come on.

01:23:09.944 --> 01:23:12.613
Go help Angus and the others.
I'm gonna find me this Otis.

01:23:12.697 --> 01:23:13.698
Okay.

01:23:14.282 --> 01:23:15.867
Close your eyes!
Close your eyes!

01:23:15.950 --> 01:23:16.990
Come on, come on, come on!

01:23:17.034 --> 01:23:18.411
Keep your eyes closed! Go! Move!

01:23:19.036 --> 01:23:20.037
Go! Go!

01:23:20.538 --> 01:23:21.539
Watch out! No!

01:23:27.170 --> 01:23:28.671
Let's go! Come on!

01:23:41.809 --> 01:23:43.144
Whoa!

01:24:06.834 --> 01:24:08.544
Roy: I get it. It's hot.

01:24:08.836 --> 01:24:10.379
It's gonna get
a whole lot hotter.

01:24:12.757 --> 01:24:13.966
Julius: Please. Please.

01:24:14.300 --> 01:24:15.343
No, no, no, no_.

01:24:22.600 --> 01:24:24.185
Get out of here. Go!

01:24:37.406 --> 01:24:38.741
Slim: Keep your eyes closed!

01:24:38.824 --> 01:24:39.825
Keep your eyes closed!

01:24:39.951 --> 01:24:41.369
Come on! Go!

01:24:41.494 --> 01:24:42.828
Go! Feeh

01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:36.090
We need to hold on.

01:26:02.408 --> 01:26:04.076
Hold on!

01:26:25.097 --> 01:26:26.515
Angus: Hey, it's over.

01:26:26.599 --> 01:26:27.641
It's over.

01:26:31.604 --> 01:26:33.939
That's some powerful tears
you got there.

01:26:34.899 --> 01:26:37.943
And the wretched
are where they belong.

01:26:39.278 --> 01:26:41.072
Roy: And Otis, too,
from the looks of it.

01:26:45.910 --> 01:26:48.120
Thanks for showing up
when you did.

01:26:48.204 --> 01:26:49.914
You didn't give me much choice.

01:26:51.248 --> 01:26:53.709
Little help, please.

01:26:56.462 --> 01:26:57.463
Come on.

01:27:02.259 --> 01:27:03.636
Oh, it's really in there.

01:27:03.719 --> 01:27:05.919
Jeanne: Yes, it's like the
earth is tightened around it.

01:27:06.263 --> 01:27:10.393
Otis: Your interference
is really testing my Patience.

01:27:28.786 --> 01:27:32.581
Appears I'll have to wait
another 25 years

01:27:32.665 --> 01:27:34.083
for this opportunity.

01:27:34.500 --> 01:27:35.501
Astaroth!

01:27:35.876 --> 01:27:38.587
As... what? What's an astaroth?

01:27:40.172 --> 01:27:41.924
Jeanne: One-third
of the evil Trinity.

01:27:42.883 --> 01:27:44.969
The right hand
to the devil himself.

01:27:45.261 --> 01:27:48.931
Until I Rose to establish
my own throne here on earth.

01:27:49.014 --> 01:27:51.434
And you're not gonna
stop me this time!

01:28:06.449 --> 01:28:07.950
Jeanne:
I've lost the tears, Roy.

01:28:13.539 --> 01:28:14.999
I've got to get to my sword.

01:28:18.127 --> 01:28:19.128
Roy: Hold on, now.

01:28:20.171 --> 01:28:21.714
Look what got left behind.

01:28:26.677 --> 01:28:28.220
Relax. I got this.

01:28:28.971 --> 01:28:30.639
Hey, asshole-roth!

01:29:38.582 --> 01:29:42.294
Nothing more humiliating
than having your soul taken

01:29:42.378 --> 01:29:44.964
by your own weapon, huh?

01:29:49.593 --> 01:29:51.011
Roy: The tears.

01:29:51.095 --> 01:29:53.222
Let there be something left.

01:30:34.722 --> 01:30:36.307
Eat your heart out,
Annie oakley.

01:31:08.088 --> 01:31:11.842
Jeanne: I'm quite sure butterfield
does not expect us to settle our tab.

01:31:12.885 --> 01:31:15.387
No, but we got
some unfinished business.

01:31:17.473 --> 01:31:19.141
I never meant
to kill that sheriff!

01:31:19.224 --> 01:31:20.225
Slim: Let's go. Please.

01:31:20.309 --> 01:31:21.435
You got to believe me.

01:31:21.518 --> 01:31:23.354
Slim: I found him cowering
under the bed.

01:31:23.437 --> 01:31:25.064
Go on, tell him the truth!

01:31:27.066 --> 01:31:29.276
When Otis took over my town,

01:31:29.860 --> 01:31:31.528
I tried to escape.

01:31:31.612 --> 01:31:33.822
Caught me a train
across the border.

01:31:33.906 --> 01:31:35.783
Just so it happened,
them Samuel bandits

01:31:35.866 --> 01:31:37.951
were working over horseshoe
at the same time,

01:31:38.035 --> 01:31:40.954
stealing more folks for Otis
as the train passed through.

01:31:41.038 --> 01:31:43.374
I didn't want them Samuels
bringing me back.

01:31:45.334 --> 01:31:47.086
So, when I fired that gun...

01:31:47.169 --> 01:31:49.421
I thought I was shooting
one of them.

01:31:49.880 --> 01:31:50.881
Butterfield!

01:31:50.964 --> 01:31:53.467
No. No, come here.

01:31:54.093 --> 01:31:55.177
Go on!

01:31:55.928 --> 01:31:57.429
I knew he was there.

01:31:57.513 --> 01:31:59.973
I knew he was the weakest.

01:32:00.641 --> 01:32:03.977
I had them fake bills printed
in order to save my own hide.

01:32:04.061 --> 01:32:07.481
Why do you women even care
so much about that damn sheriff?

01:32:07.564 --> 01:32:11.068
I know what Marcus aurelius
thinks about revenge.

01:32:11.151 --> 01:32:13.445
But what does the Bible say,
and make it quick?

01:32:13.529 --> 01:32:17.991
Roy, if I start quoting the Bible,
butterfield will die of old age.

01:32:18.492 --> 01:32:21.161
You know what to do.

01:32:25.749 --> 01:32:29.169
I heard that you lost your
lawman up there last night.

01:32:29.253 --> 01:32:32.923
Is there anyone that you or the
town wanna elect as new sheriff?

01:32:33.549 --> 01:32:34.883
Yes, there is.

01:32:36.343 --> 01:32:37.344
Him.

01:32:37.928 --> 01:32:38.929
Him? Me?

01:32:39.722 --> 01:32:41.432
And I'm going to be his deputy.

01:32:43.183 --> 01:32:44.309
All right, then.

01:32:45.811 --> 01:32:48.313
You saw firsthand
where you're gonna end up.

01:32:48.397 --> 01:32:51.108
There ain't nothing worse
that I can to you than that.

01:32:51.191 --> 01:32:53.527
Take him away. Lock him up.

01:32:53.610 --> 01:32:54.903
Deputy.

01:32:57.322 --> 01:32:58.615
Let's go!

01:32:58.699 --> 01:33:00.492
Julius. Ah!

01:33:01.410 --> 01:33:03.245
Release me! Deado outlaw...

01:33:03.328 --> 01:33:06.290
To deado lawman. You've
come a long way, son.

01:33:07.791 --> 01:33:10.586
I guess you've earned the right
for us to know who you really are.

01:33:10.669 --> 01:33:12.129
Should we call you bumble?

01:33:13.630 --> 01:33:16.008
No. Keep calling me slim.

01:33:16.091 --> 01:33:18.510
I intend on bringing
only honor to the name.

01:33:18.594 --> 01:33:21.722
We'll come get you when
your soul's retrial has been set.

01:33:21.805 --> 01:33:23.348
But you step out of line here,

01:33:23.432 --> 01:33:25.552
and we'll be coming back
for a whole different reason.

01:33:26.268 --> 01:33:27.728
Message Roy-ceiphed.

01:33:34.234 --> 01:33:35.903
Well...

01:33:36.278 --> 01:33:40.908
I guess us ladies need to go
shopping for a couple of dresses.

01:33:40.991 --> 01:33:41.992
Because_.

01:33:44.953 --> 01:33:48.081
We cannot go to my daughter's
wedding looking like this!

01:33:51.752 --> 01:33:53.003
Yeah, whatever that means!

01:33:53.086 --> 01:33:55.798
It means, "oh, my god!"

01:34:00.552 --> 01:34:04.515
Ladies and gentlemen, I present
to you Mr. and Mrs. Parker!

01:34:06.850 --> 01:34:08.101
Thank you so much.

01:34:08.185 --> 01:34:09.311
Thank you.

01:34:09.394 --> 01:34:10.729
Thank you.

01:34:10.813 --> 01:34:12.356
There they are. Come on.

01:34:12.439 --> 01:34:14.066
One second, one second.
Come on, come on.

01:34:14.858 --> 01:34:16.151
Well, now.

01:34:16.235 --> 01:34:18.779
Don't you two look
simply magnificent?

01:34:19.321 --> 01:34:23.408
Good luck, Angus. After today you'll
face a far greater challenge than hell.

01:34:23.492 --> 01:34:24.701
Marriage.

01:34:24.785 --> 01:34:26.620
And you're gonna love
every second of it.

01:34:26.787 --> 01:34:28.288
Uh...

01:34:28.372 --> 01:34:29.665
Are you okay, Mabel?

01:34:29.748 --> 01:34:31.828
'Cause I didn't understand
a word that you just said.

01:34:35.879 --> 01:34:40.509
I think my sister must have
burned her tongue up there.

01:34:40.592 --> 01:34:43.887
She said she couldn't be happier

01:34:43.971 --> 01:34:47.391
for you and your beautiful wife.

01:35:24.720 --> 01:35:26.179
Charlotte:
I know I just met her,

01:35:26.263 --> 01:35:29.057
but it feels like I've known
Mabel my whole life.

01:35:29.141 --> 01:35:30.434
Angus: I know.

01:35:31.393 --> 01:35:32.936
She is very...

01:35:33.020 --> 01:35:34.479
Otherworldly.

01:35:40.277 --> 01:35:43.238
Roy: So tell me why Angus
can't understand me now.

01:35:43.322 --> 01:35:46.617
Because now that you've
approved of your daughter's marriage,

01:35:48.368 --> 01:35:51.955
your soul considers
Angus a loved one.

01:35:52.039 --> 01:35:53.206
Hmm.

01:35:54.625 --> 01:35:58.629
So, uh, what are we gonna do
with these here horses?

01:35:59.504 --> 01:36:00.589
Let them go.

01:36:00.672 --> 01:36:02.966
They'll be here for us
whenever we need them.

01:36:10.265 --> 01:36:13.018
You know, I've
been thinking, I get it.

01:36:13.101 --> 01:36:15.979
You're ripd for the
rest of your afterlife.

01:36:16.063 --> 01:36:18.690
Duty, honor, servitude
and all that.

01:36:19.191 --> 01:36:23.654
But between you and me and
the fencepost, I reckon' I'm done.

01:36:24.321 --> 01:36:27.574
As soon as we're done
with this shitty ride here,

01:36:27.658 --> 01:36:30.994
I'm gonna tell hano
to open up that portal

01:36:31.078 --> 01:36:34.539
point me towards the sweet
warmth of eternal glory,

01:36:35.207 --> 01:36:36.792
and send me on my way.

01:36:39.252 --> 01:36:41.004
I want you to know,

01:36:41.088 --> 01:36:44.591
I'm real glad to have served
with you and the ripd,

01:36:46.176 --> 01:36:47.344
paflner

01:36:55.727 --> 01:36:59.481
What... what's funny?

01:36:59.564 --> 01:37:02.025
You didn't read
your contract, did you?

01:37:02.109 --> 01:37:04.236
Hell, no. That thing
was thickerthan slim.

01:37:04.319 --> 01:37:07.614
Well, eternal glory
does await you, Roy,

01:37:08.824 --> 01:37:13.412
but only after you served your
minimum 100-year contract term.

01:37:14.246 --> 01:37:16.665
One hundred years? Mmm-hmm.

01:37:16.748 --> 01:37:20.544
Looks like you and me aren't
done with each other yet, partner.

01:37:23.714 --> 01:37:24.715
Come on!

01:37:34.516 --> 01:37:35.726
God damn it.

01:37:36.643 --> 01:37:37.644
Sorry, boss.

01:37:37.769 --> 01:37:40.355
What I meant to say was...
Damn it!
